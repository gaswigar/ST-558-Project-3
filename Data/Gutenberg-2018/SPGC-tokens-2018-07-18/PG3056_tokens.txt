preface
an
apology
is
perhaps
needed
for
the
neglect
of
contrast
which
is
shown
by
presenting
two
consecutive
stories
of
hangmen
in
such
a
small
collection
as
the
following
but
in
the
neighbourhood
of
tales
of
executions
used
to
form
a
large
proportion
of
the
local
traditions
and
though
never
personally
acquainted
with
any
chief
operator
at
such
scenes
the
writer
of
these
pages
had
as
a
boy
the
privilege
of
being
on
speaking
terms
with
a
man
who
applied
for
the
office
and
who
sank
into
an
incurable
melancholy
because
he
failed
to
get
it
some
slight
mitigation
of
his
grief
being
to
dwell
upon
striking
episodes
in
the
lives
of
those
happier
ones
who
had
held
it
with
success
and
renown
his
tale
of
disappointment
used
to
cause
some
wonder
why
his
ambition
should
have
taken
such
an
unfortunate
form
but
its
nobleness
was
never
questioned
in
those
days
too
there
was
still
living
an
old
woman
who
for
the
cure
of
some
eating
disease
had
been
taken
in
her
youth
to
have
her
turned
by
a
convict
corpse
in
the
manner
described
in
withered
arm
since
writing
this
story
some
years
ago
i
have
been
reminded
by
an
aged
friend
who
knew
brook
that
in
relating
her
dream
my
forgetfulness
has
weakened
the
facts
our
of
which
the
tale
grew
in
reality
it
was
while
lying
down
on
a
hot
afternoon
that
the
incubus
oppressed
her
and
she
flung
it
off
with
the
results
upon
the
body
of
the
original
as
described
to
my
mind
the
occurrence
of
such
a
vision
in
the
daytime
is
more
impressive
than
if
it
had
happened
in
a
midnight
dream
readers
are
therefore
asked
to
correct
the
misrelation
which
affords
an
instance
of
how
our
imperfect
memories
insensibly
formalize
the
fresh
originality
of
living
fact
from
whose
shape
they
slowly
depart
as
castings
depart
by
degrees
from
the
sharp
of
the
mould
among
the
many
devices
for
concealing
smuggled
goods
in
caves
and
pits
of
the
earth
that
of
planting
an
in
a
tray
or
box
which
was
placed
over
the
mouth
of
the
pit
is
i
believe
unique
and
it
is
detailed
in
one
of
the
tales
precisely
as
described
by
an
old
carrier
of
a
man
who
was
afterwards
in
my
father
employ
for
over
thirty
years
i
never
gathered
from
his
reminiscences
what
means
were
adopted
for
lifting
the
tree
which
with
its
roots
earth
and
receptacle
must
have
been
of
considerable
weight
there
is
no
doubt
however
that
the
thing
was
done
through
many
years
my
informant
often
spoke
too
of
the
horribly
suffocating
sensation
produced
by
the
pair
of
slung
upon
the
chest
and
back
after
stumbling
with
the
burden
of
them
for
several
miles
inland
over
a
rough
country
and
in
darkness
he
said
that
though
years
of
his
youth
and
young
manhood
were
spent
in
this
irregular
business
his
profits
from
the
same
taken
all
together
did
not
average
the
wages
he
might
have
earned
in
a
steady
employment
whilst
the
fatigues
and
risks
were
excessive
i
may
add
that
the
first
story
in
the
series
turns
upon
a
physical
possibility
that
may
attach
to
women
of
imaginative
temperament
and
that
is
well
supported
by
the
experiences
of
medical
men
and
other
observers
of
such
manifestations
april
an
imaginative
woman
when
william
marchmill
had
finished
his
inquiries
for
lodgings
at
a
known
in
upper
wessex
he
returned
to
the
hotel
to
find
his
wife
she
with
the
children
had
rambled
along
the
shore
and
marchmill
followed
in
the
direction
indicated
by
the
jove
how
far
you
gone
i
am
quite
out
of
breath
marchmill
said
rather
impatiently
when
he
came
up
with
his
wife
who
was
reading
as
she
walked
the
three
children
being
considerably
further
ahead
with
the
nurse
marchmill
started
out
of
the
reverie
into
which
the
book
had
thrown
her
she
said
been
such
a
long
time
i
was
tired
of
staying
in
that
dreary
hotel
but
i
am
sorry
if
you
have
wanted
me
will
i
have
had
trouble
to
suit
myself
when
you
see
the
airy
and
comfortable
rooms
heard
of
you
find
they
are
stuffy
and
uncomfortable
will
you
come
and
see
if
what
i
fixed
on
will
do
there
is
not
much
room
i
am
afraid
hut
i
can
light
on
nothing
better
the
town
is
rather
full
the
pair
left
the
children
and
nurse
to
continue
their
ramble
and
went
back
together
in
age
in
personal
appearance
fairly
matched
and
in
domestic
requirements
conformable
in
temper
this
couple
differed
though
even
here
they
did
not
often
clash
he
being
equable
if
not
lymphatic
and
she
decidedly
nervous
and
sanguine
it
was
to
their
tastes
and
fancies
those
smallest
greatest
particulars
that
no
common
denominator
could
be
applied
marchmill
considered
his
wife
likes
and
inclinations
somewhat
silly
she
considered
his
sordid
and
material
the
business
was
that
of
a
gunmaker
in
a
thriving
city
northwards
and
his
soul
was
in
that
business
always
the
lady
was
best
characterized
by
that
superannuated
phrase
of
elegance
votary
of
the
muse
an
impressionable
palpitating
creature
was
ella
shrinking
humanely
from
detailed
knowledge
of
her
husband
trade
whenever
she
reflected
that
everything
he
manufactured
had
for
its
purpose
the
destruction
of
life
she
could
only
recover
her
equanimity
by
assuring
herself
that
some
at
least
of
his
weapons
were
sooner
or
later
used
for
the
extermination
of
horrid
vermin
and
animals
almost
as
cruel
to
their
inferiors
in
species
as
human
beings
were
to
theirs
she
had
never
antecedently
regarded
this
occupation
of
his
as
any
objection
to
having
him
for
a
husband
indeed
the
necessity
of
getting
at
all
cost
a
cardinal
virtue
which
all
good
mothers
teach
kept
her
from
thinking
of
it
at
all
till
she
had
closed
with
william
had
passed
the
honeymoon
and
reached
the
reflecting
stage
then
like
a
person
who
has
stumbled
upon
some
object
in
the
dark
she
wondered
what
she
had
got
mentally
walked
round
it
estimated
it
whether
it
were
rare
or
common
contained
gold
silver
or
lead
were
a
clog
or
a
pedestal
everything
to
her
or
nothing
she
came
to
some
vague
conclusions
and
since
then
had
kept
her
heart
alive
by
pitying
her
proprietor
obtuseness
and
want
of
refinement
pitying
herself
and
letting
off
her
delicate
and
ethereal
emotions
in
imaginative
occupations
and
which
perhaps
would
not
much
have
disturbed
william
if
he
had
known
of
them
her
figure
was
small
elegant
and
slight
in
build
tripping
or
rather
bounding
in
movement
she
was
and
had
that
marvellously
bright
and
liquid
sparkle
in
each
pupil
which
characterizes
persons
of
ella
cast
of
soul
and
is
too
often
a
cause
of
heartache
to
the
possessor
male
friends
ultimately
sometimes
to
herself
her
husband
was
a
tall
man
with
a
brown
beard
he
had
a
pondering
regard
and
was
it
must
be
added
usually
kind
and
tolerant
to
her
he
spoke
in
squarely
shaped
sentences
and
was
supremely
satisfied
with
a
condition
of
sublunary
things
which
made
weapons
a
necessity
husband
and
wife
walked
till
they
had
reached
the
house
they
were
in
search
of
which
stood
in
a
terrace
facing
the
sea
and
was
fronted
by
a
small
garden
of
and
evergreens
stone
steps
leading
up
to
the
porch
it
had
its
number
in
the
row
but
being
rather
larger
than
the
rest
was
in
addition
sedulously
distinguished
as
coburg
house
by
its
landlady
though
everybody
else
called
it
new
parade
the
spot
was
bright
and
lively
now
but
in
winter
it
became
necessary
to
place
sandbags
against
the
door
and
to
stuff
up
the
keyhole
against
the
wind
and
rain
which
had
worn
the
paint
so
thin
that
the
priming
and
knotting
showed
through
the
householder
who
bad
been
watching
for
the
gentleman
return
met
them
in
the
passage
and
showed
the
rooms
she
informed
them
that
she
was
a
professional
man
widow
left
in
needy
circumstances
by
the
rather
sudden
death
of
her
husband
and
she
spoke
anxiously
of
the
conveniences
of
the
establishment
marchmill
said
that
she
liked
the
situation
and
the
house
but
it
being
small
there
would
not
be
accommodation
enough
unless
she
could
have
all
the
rooms
the
landlady
mused
with
an
air
of
disappointment
she
wanted
the
visitors
to
be
her
tenants
very
badly
she
said
with
obvious
honesty
but
unfortunately
two
of
the
rooms
were
occupied
permanently
by
a
bachelor
gentleman
he
did
not
pay
season
prices
it
was
true
but
as
he
kept
on
his
apartments
all
the
year
round
and
was
an
extremely
nice
and
interesting
young
man
who
gave
no
trouble
she
did
not
like
to
turn
him
out
for
a
month
even
at
a
high
figure
however
she
added
might
offer
to
go
for
a
time
they
would
not
hear
of
this
and
went
back
to
the
hotel
intending
to
proceed
to
the
agent
to
inquire
further
hardly
had
they
sat
down
to
tea
when
the
landlady
called
her
gentleman
she
said
had
been
so
obliging
as
to
offer
to
give
up
his
rooms
for
three
or
four
weeks
rather
than
drive
the
away
is
very
kind
but
we
wo
inconvenience
him
in
that
way
said
the
marchmills
it
wo
inconvenience
him
i
assure
you
said
the
landlady
eloquently
see
he
a
different
sort
of
young
man
from
most
dreamy
solitary
rather
melancholy
and
he
cares
more
to
be
here
when
the
gales
are
beating
against
the
door
and
the
sea
washes
over
the
parade
and
there
not
a
soul
in
the
place
than
he
does
now
in
the
season
he
just
as
soon
be
where
in
fact
he
going
temporarily
to
a
little
cottage
on
the
island
opposite
for
a
change
she
hoped
therefore
that
they
would
come
the
marchmill
family
accordingly
took
possession
of
the
house
next
day
and
it
seemed
to
suit
them
very
well
after
luncheon
marchmill
strolled
out
towards
the
pier
and
marchmill
having
despatched
the
children
to
their
outdoor
amusements
on
the
sands
settled
herself
in
more
completely
examining
this
and
that
article
and
testing
the
reflecting
powers
of
the
mirror
in
the
wardrobe
door
in
the
small
back
which
had
been
the
young
bachelor
she
found
furniture
of
a
more
personal
nature
than
in
the
rest
shabby
books
of
correct
rather
than
rare
editions
were
piled
up
in
a
queerly
reserved
manner
in
corners
as
if
the
previous
occupant
had
not
conceived
the
possibility
that
any
incoming
person
of
the
season
bringing
could
care
to
look
inside
them
the
landlady
hovered
on
the
threshold
to
rectify
anything
that
marchmill
might
not
find
to
her
satisfaction
make
this
my
own
little
room
said
the
latter
the
books
are
here
by
the
way
the
person
who
has
left
seems
to
have
a
good
many
he
wo
mind
my
reading
some
of
them
hooper
i
hope
dear
no
yes
he
has
a
good
many
you
see
he
is
in
the
literary
line
himself
somewhat
he
is
a
poet
yes
really
a
poet
and
he
has
a
little
income
of
his
own
which
is
enough
to
write
verses
on
but
not
enough
for
cutting
a
figure
even
if
he
cared
to
poet
o
i
did
not
know
that
marchmill
opened
one
of
the
books
and
saw
the
owner
name
written
on
the
me
she
continued
know
his
name
very
well
robert
trewe
of
course
i
do
and
his
writings
and
it
is
his
rooms
we
have
taken
and
him
we
have
turned
out
of
his
home
ella
marchmill
sitting
down
alone
a
few
minutes
later
thought
with
interested
surprise
of
robert
trewe
her
own
latter
history
will
best
explain
that
interest
herself
the
only
daughter
of
a
struggling
man
of
letters
she
had
during
the
last
year
or
two
taken
to
writing
poems
in
an
endeavour
to
find
a
congenial
channel
in
which
to
let
flow
her
painfully
embayed
emotions
whose
former
limpidity
and
sparkle
seemed
departing
in
the
stagnation
caused
by
the
routine
of
a
practical
household
and
the
gloom
of
bearing
children
to
a
commonplace
father
these
poems
subscribed
with
a
masculine
pseudonym
had
appeared
in
various
obscure
magazines
and
in
two
cases
in
rather
prominent
ones
in
the
second
of
the
latter
the
page
which
bore
her
effusion
at
the
bottom
in
smallish
print
bore
at
the
top
in
large
print
a
few
verses
on
the
same
subject
by
this
very
man
robert
trewe
both
of
them
had
in
fact
been
struck
by
a
tragic
incident
reported
in
the
daily
papers
and
had
used
it
simultaneously
as
an
inspiration
the
editor
remarking
in
a
note
upon
the
coincidence
and
that
the
excellence
of
both
poems
prompted
him
to
give
them
together
after
that
event
ella
otherwise
ivy
had
watched
with
much
attention
the
appearance
anywhere
in
print
of
verse
bearing
the
signature
of
robert
trewe
who
with
a
man
unsusceptibility
on
the
question
of
sex
had
never
once
thought
of
passing
himself
off
as
a
woman
to
be
sure
marchmill
had
satisfied
herself
with
a
sort
of
reason
for
doing
the
contrary
in
her
case
that
nobody
might
believe
in
her
inspiration
if
they
found
that
the
sentiments
came
from
a
pushing
tradesman
wife
from
the
mother
of
three
children
by
a
manufacturer
trewe
verse
contrasted
with
that
of
the
rank
and
file
of
recent
minor
poets
in
being
impassioned
rather
than
ingenious
luxuriant
rather
than
finished
neither
symboliste
nor
decadent
he
was
a
pessimist
in
so
far
as
that
character
applies
to
a
man
who
looks
at
the
worst
contingencies
as
well
as
the
best
in
the
human
condition
being
little
attracted
by
excellences
of
form
and
rhythm
apart
from
content
he
sometimes
when
feeling
outran
his
artistic
speed
perpetrated
sonnets
in
the
loosely
rhymed
elizabethan
fashion
which
every
reviewer
said
he
ought
not
to
have
done
with
sad
and
hopeless
envy
ella
marchmill
had
often
and
often
scanned
the
rival
poet
work
so
much
stronger
as
it
always
was
than
her
own
feeble
lines
she
had
imitated
him
and
her
inability
to
touch
his
level
would
send
her
into
fits
of
despondency
months
passed
away
thus
till
she
observed
from
the
publishers
list
that
trewe
had
collected
his
fugitive
pieces
into
a
volume
which
was
duly
issued
and
was
much
or
little
praised
according
to
chance
and
had
a
sale
quite
sufficient
to
pay
for
the
printing
this
step
onward
had
suggested
to
john
ivy
the
idea
of
collecting
her
pieces
also
or
at
any
rate
of
making
up
a
book
of
her
rhymes
by
adding
many
in
manuscript
to
the
few
that
had
seen
the
light
for
she
had
been
able
to
get
no
great
number
into
print
a
ruinous
charge
was
made
for
costs
of
publication
a
few
reviews
noticed
her
poor
little
volume
but
nobody
talked
of
it
nobody
bought
it
and
it
fell
dead
in
a
fortnight
if
it
had
ever
been
alive
the
author
thoughts
were
diverted
to
another
groove
just
then
by
the
discovery
that
she
was
going
to
have
a
third
child
and
the
collapse
of
her
poetical
venture
had
perhaps
less
effect
upon
her
mind
than
it
might
have
done
if
she
had
been
domestically
unoccupied
her
husband
had
paid
the
publisher
bill
with
the
doctor
and
there
it
all
had
ended
for
the
time
but
though
less
than
a
poet
of
her
century
ella
was
more
than
a
mere
multiplier
of
her
kind
and
latterly
she
had
begun
to
feel
the
old
afflatus
once
more
and
now
by
an
odd
conjunction
she
found
herself
in
the
rooms
of
robert
trewe
she
thoughtfully
rose
from
her
chair
and
searched
the
apartment
with
the
interest
of
a
yes
the
volume
of
his
own
verse
was
among
the
rest
though
quite
familiar
with
its
contents
she
read
it
here
as
if
it
spoke
aloud
to
her
then
called
up
hooper
the
landlady
for
some
trivial
service
and
inquired
again
about
the
young
man
i
sure
you
be
interested
in
him
if
you
could
see
him
only
he
so
shy
that
i
do
suppose
you
will
hooper
seemed
nothing
loth
to
minister
to
her
tenant
curiosity
about
her
predecessor
here
long
yes
nearly
two
years
he
keeps
on
his
rooms
even
when
he
not
here
the
soft
air
of
this
place
suits
his
chest
and
he
likes
to
be
able
to
come
back
at
any
time
he
is
mostly
writing
or
reading
and
does
see
many
people
though
for
the
matter
of
that
he
is
such
a
good
kind
young
fellow
that
folks
would
only
be
too
glad
to
be
friendly
with
him
if
they
knew
him
you
do
meet
people
every
day
he
and
good
he
oblige
me
in
anything
if
i
ask
him
trewe
i
say
to
him
sometimes
you
are
rather
out
of
spirits
well
i
am
hooper
he
say
though
i
do
know
how
you
should
find
it
out
why
not
take
a
little
change
i
ask
then
in
a
day
or
two
he
say
that
he
will
take
a
trip
to
paris
or
norway
or
somewhere
and
i
assure
you
he
comes
back
all
the
better
for
it
indeed
his
is
a
sensitive
nature
no
doubt
still
he
odd
in
some
things
once
when
he
had
finished
a
poem
of
his
composition
late
at
night
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
rehearsing
it
and
the
floors
being
so
thin
houses
you
know
though
i
say
it
myself
he
kept
me
awake
up
above
him
till
i
wished
him
further
but
we
get
on
very
well
this
was
but
the
beginning
of
a
series
of
conversations
about
the
rising
poet
as
the
days
went
on
on
one
of
these
occasions
hooper
drew
ella
attention
to
what
she
had
not
noticed
before
minute
scribblings
in
pencil
on
the
behind
the
curtains
at
the
head
of
the
bed
let
me
look
said
marchmill
unable
to
conceal
a
rush
of
tender
curiosity
as
she
bent
her
pretty
face
close
to
the
wall
said
hooper
with
the
manner
of
a
woman
who
knew
things
the
very
beginnings
and
first
thoughts
of
his
verses
he
has
tried
to
rub
most
of
them
out
but
you
can
read
them
still
my
belief
is
that
he
wakes
up
in
the
night
you
know
with
some
rhyme
in
his
head
and
jots
it
down
there
on
the
wall
lest
he
should
forget
it
by
the
morning
some
of
these
very
lines
you
see
here
i
have
seen
afterwards
in
print
in
the
magazines
some
are
newer
indeed
i
have
not
seen
that
one
before
it
must
have
been
done
only
a
few
days
ago
yes
ella
marchmill
flushed
without
knowing
why
and
suddenly
wished
her
companion
would
go
away
now
that
the
information
was
imparted
an
indescribable
consciousness
of
personal
interest
rather
than
literary
made
her
anxious
to
read
the
inscription
alone
and
she
accordingly
waited
till
she
could
do
so
with
a
sense
that
a
great
store
of
emotion
would
be
enjoyed
in
the
act
perhaps
because
the
sea
was
choppy
outside
the
island
ella
husband
found
it
much
pleasanter
to
go
sailing
and
steaming
about
without
his
wife
who
was
a
bad
sailor
than
with
her
he
did
not
disdain
to
go
thus
alone
on
board
the
steamboats
of
the
where
there
was
dancing
by
moonlight
and
where
the
couples
would
come
suddenly
down
with
a
lurch
into
each
other
arms
for
as
he
blandly
told
her
the
company
was
too
mixed
for
him
to
take
her
amid
such
scenes
thus
while
this
thriving
manufacturer
got
a
great
deal
of
change
and
out
of
his
sojourn
here
the
life
external
at
least
of
ella
was
monotonous
enough
and
mainly
consisted
in
passing
a
certain
number
of
hours
each
day
in
bathing
and
walking
up
and
down
a
stretch
of
shore
but
the
poetic
impulse
having
again
waxed
strong
she
was
possessed
by
an
inner
flame
which
left
her
hardly
conscious
of
what
was
proceeding
around
her
she
had
read
till
she
knew
by
heart
trewe
last
little
volume
of
verses
and
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
in
vainly
attempting
to
rival
some
of
them
till
in
her
failure
she
burst
into
tears
the
personal
element
in
the
magnetic
attraction
exercised
by
this
circumambient
unapproachable
master
of
hers
was
so
much
stronger
than
the
intellectual
and
abstract
that
she
could
not
understand
it
to
be
sure
she
was
surrounded
noon
and
night
by
his
customary
environment
which
literally
whispered
of
him
to
her
at
every
moment
but
he
was
a
man
she
had
never
seen
and
that
all
that
moved
her
was
the
instinct
to
specialize
a
waiting
emotion
on
the
first
fit
thing
that
came
to
hand
did
not
of
course
suggest
itself
to
ella
in
the
natural
way
of
passion
under
the
too
practical
conditions
which
civilization
has
devised
for
its
fruition
her
husband
love
for
her
had
not
survived
except
in
the
form
of
fitful
friendship
any
more
than
or
even
so
much
as
her
own
for
him
and
being
a
woman
of
very
living
ardours
that
required
sustenance
of
some
sort
they
were
beginning
to
feed
on
this
chancing
material
which
was
indeed
of
a
quality
far
better
than
chance
usually
offers
one
day
the
children
had
been
playing
in
a
closet
whence
in
their
excitement
they
pulled
out
some
clothing
hooper
explained
that
it
belonged
to
trewe
and
hung
it
up
in
the
closet
again
possessed
of
her
fantasy
ella
went
later
in
the
afternoon
when
nobody
was
in
that
part
of
the
house
opened
the
closet
unhitched
one
of
the
articles
a
mackintosh
and
put
it
on
with
the
waterproof
cap
belonging
to
it
mantle
of
elijah
she
said
it
might
inspire
me
to
rival
him
glorious
genius
that
he
is
her
eyes
always
grew
wet
when
she
thought
like
that
and
she
turned
to
look
at
herself
in
the
glass
his
heart
had
beat
inside
that
coat
and
his
brain
had
worked
under
that
hat
at
levels
of
thought
she
would
never
reach
the
consciousness
of
her
weakness
beside
him
made
her
feel
quite
sick
before
she
had
got
the
things
off
her
the
door
opened
and
her
husband
entered
the
room
the
devil
she
blushed
and
removed
them
found
them
in
the
closet
here
she
said
put
them
on
in
a
freak
what
have
i
else
to
do
you
are
always
away
away
well
that
evening
she
had
a
further
talk
with
the
landlady
who
might
herself
have
nourished
a
regard
for
the
poet
so
ready
was
she
to
discourse
ardently
about
him
are
interested
in
trewe
i
know
she
said
he
has
just
sent
to
say
that
he
is
going
to
call
afternoon
to
look
up
some
books
of
his
that
he
wants
if
i
be
in
and
he
may
select
them
from
your
room
yes
could
very
well
meet
mr
trewe
then
if
you
like
to
be
in
the
way
she
promised
with
secret
delight
and
went
to
bed
musing
of
him
next
morning
her
husband
observed
been
thinking
of
what
you
said
ell
that
i
have
gone
about
a
good
deal
and
left
you
without
much
to
amuse
you
perhaps
it
true
as
there
not
much
sea
take
you
with
me
on
board
the
yacht
for
the
first
time
in
her
experience
of
such
an
offer
ella
was
not
glad
but
she
accepted
it
for
the
moment
the
time
for
setting
out
drew
near
and
she
went
to
get
ready
she
stood
reflecting
the
longing
to
see
the
poet
she
was
now
distinctly
in
love
with
overpowered
all
other
considerations
do
want
to
go
she
said
to
herself
ca
bear
to
be
away
and
i
wo
go
she
told
her
husband
that
she
had
changed
her
mind
about
wishing
to
sail
he
was
indifferent
and
went
his
way
for
the
rest
of
the
day
the
house
was
quiet
the
children
having
gone
out
upon
the
sands
the
blinds
waved
in
the
sunshine
to
the
soft
steady
stroke
of
the
sea
beyond
the
wall
and
the
notes
of
the
green
silesian
band
a
troop
of
foreign
gentlemen
hired
for
the
season
had
drawn
almost
all
the
residents
and
promenaders
away
from
the
vicinity
of
coburg
house
a
knock
was
audible
at
the
door
marchmill
did
not
hear
any
servant
go
to
answer
it
and
she
became
impatient
the
books
were
in
the
room
where
she
sat
but
nobody
came
up
she
rang
the
bell
is
some
person
waiting
at
the
door
she
said
no
he
gone
long
ago
i
answered
it
hooper
came
in
herself
disappointing
she
said
trewe
not
coming
after
all
i
heard
him
knock
i
fancy
that
was
somebody
inquiring
for
lodgings
who
came
to
the
wrong
house
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
trewe
sent
a
note
just
before
lunch
to
say
i
need
get
any
tea
for
him
as
he
should
not
require
the
books
and
would
come
to
select
them
ella
was
miserable
and
for
a
long
time
could
not
even
his
mournful
ballad
on
lives
so
aching
was
her
erratic
little
heart
and
so
tearful
her
eyes
when
the
children
came
in
with
wet
stockings
and
ran
up
to
her
to
tell
her
of
their
adventures
she
could
not
feel
that
she
cared
about
them
half
as
much
as
usual
hooper
have
you
a
photograph
of
the
gentleman
who
lived
here
she
was
getting
to
be
curiously
shy
in
mentioning
his
name
yes
it
in
the
ornamental
frame
on
the
mantelpiece
in
your
own
bedroom
the
royal
duke
and
duchess
are
in
that
so
they
are
but
he
behind
them
he
belongs
rightly
to
that
frame
which
i
bought
on
purpose
but
as
he
went
away
he
said
cover
me
up
from
those
strangers
that
are
coming
for
god
sake
i
do
want
them
staring
at
me
and
i
am
sure
they
wo
want
me
staring
at
them
so
i
slipped
in
the
duke
and
duchess
temporarily
in
front
of
him
as
they
had
no
frame
and
royalties
are
more
suitable
for
letting
furnished
than
a
private
young
man
if
you
take
out
you
see
him
under
lord
he
would
mind
if
he
knew
it
he
did
think
the
next
tenant
would
be
such
an
attractive
lady
as
you
or
he
would
have
thought
of
hiding
himself
perhaps
he
handsome
she
asked
timidly
call
him
so
some
perhaps
would
i
she
asked
with
eagerness
think
you
would
though
some
would
say
he
more
striking
than
handsome
a
thoughtful
fellow
you
know
with
a
very
electric
flash
in
his
eye
when
he
looks
round
quickly
such
as
you
expect
a
poet
to
be
who
does
get
his
living
by
it
old
is
he
years
older
than
yourself
about
or
two
i
think
ella
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
few
months
over
thirty
herself
but
she
did
not
look
nearly
so
much
though
so
immature
in
nature
she
was
entering
on
that
tract
of
life
in
which
emotional
women
begin
to
suspect
that
last
love
may
be
stronger
than
first
love
and
she
would
soon
alas
enter
on
the
still
more
melancholy
tract
when
at
least
the
vainer
ones
of
her
sex
shrink
from
receiving
a
male
visitor
otherwise
than
with
their
backs
to
the
window
or
the
blinds
half
down
she
reflected
on
hooper
remark
and
said
no
more
about
age
just
then
a
telegram
was
brought
up
it
came
from
her
husband
who
had
gone
down
the
channel
as
far
as
budmouth
with
his
friends
in
the
yacht
and
would
not
be
able
to
get
back
till
next
day
after
her
light
dinner
ella
idled
about
the
shore
with
the
children
till
dusk
thinking
of
the
yet
uncovered
photograph
in
her
room
with
a
serene
sense
of
something
ecstatic
to
come
for
with
the
subtle
luxuriousness
of
fancy
in
which
this
young
woman
was
an
adept
on
learning
that
her
husband
was
to
be
absent
that
night
she
had
refrained
from
incontinently
rushing
upstairs
and
opening
the
preferring
to
reserve
the
inspection
till
she
could
be
alone
and
a
more
romantic
tinge
be
imparted
to
the
occasion
by
silence
candles
solemn
sea
and
stars
outside
than
was
afforded
by
the
garish
afternoon
sunlight
the
children
had
been
sent
to
bed
and
ella
soon
followed
though
it
was
not
yet
ten
to
gratify
her
passionate
curiosity
she
now
made
her
preparations
first
getting
rid
of
superfluous
garments
and
putting
on
her
then
arranging
a
chair
in
front
of
the
table
and
reading
several
pages
of
trewe
tenderest
utterances
then
she
fetched
the
to
the
light
opened
the
back
took
out
the
likeness
and
set
it
up
before
her
it
was
a
striking
countenance
to
look
upon
the
poet
wore
a
luxuriant
black
moustache
and
imperial
and
a
slouched
hat
which
shaded
the
forehead
the
large
dark
eyes
described
by
the
landlady
showed
an
unlimited
capacity
for
misery
they
looked
out
from
beneath
brows
as
if
they
were
reading
the
universe
in
the
microcosm
of
the
confronter
face
and
were
not
altogether
overjoyed
at
what
the
spectacle
portended
ella
murmured
in
her
lowest
richest
tenderest
tone
it
you
who
so
cruelly
eclipsed
me
these
many
times
as
she
gazed
long
at
the
portrait
she
fell
into
thought
till
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
she
touched
the
cardboard
with
her
lips
then
she
laughed
with
a
nervous
lightness
and
wiped
her
eyes
she
thought
how
wicked
she
was
a
woman
having
a
husband
and
three
children
to
let
her
mind
stray
to
a
stranger
in
this
unconscionable
manner
no
he
was
not
a
stranger
she
knew
his
thoughts
and
feelings
as
well
as
she
knew
her
own
they
were
in
fact
the
thoughts
and
feelings
as
hers
which
her
husband
distinctly
lacked
perhaps
luckily
for
himself
considering
that
he
had
to
provide
for
family
expenses
nearer
my
real
self
he
more
intimate
with
the
real
me
than
will
is
after
all
even
though
i
never
seen
him
she
said
she
laid
his
book
and
picture
on
the
table
at
the
bedside
and
when
she
was
reclining
on
the
pillow
she
those
of
robert
trewe
verses
which
she
had
marked
from
time
to
time
as
most
touching
and
true
putting
these
aside
she
set
up
the
photograph
on
its
edge
upon
the
coverlet
and
contemplated
it
as
she
lay
then
she
scanned
again
by
the
light
of
the
candle
the
pencillings
on
the
beside
her
head
there
they
were
phrases
couplets
beginnings
and
middles
of
lines
ideas
in
the
rough
like
shelley
scraps
and
the
least
of
them
so
intense
so
sweet
so
palpitating
that
it
seemed
as
if
his
very
breath
warm
and
loving
fanned
her
cheeks
from
those
walls
walls
that
had
surrounded
his
head
times
and
times
as
they
surrounded
her
own
now
he
must
often
have
put
up
his
hand
so
with
the
pencil
in
it
yes
the
writing
was
sideways
as
it
would
be
if
executed
by
one
who
extended
his
arm
thus
these
inscribed
shapes
of
the
poet
world
more
real
than
living
man
nurslings
of
immortality
were
no
doubt
the
thoughts
and
which
had
come
to
him
in
the
dead
of
night
when
he
could
let
himself
go
and
have
no
fear
of
the
frost
of
criticism
no
doubt
they
had
often
been
written
up
hastily
by
the
light
of
the
moon
the
rays
of
the
lamp
in
the
dawn
in
full
daylight
perhaps
never
and
now
her
hair
was
dragging
where
his
arm
had
lain
when
he
secured
the
fugitive
fancies
she
was
sleeping
on
a
poet
lips
immersed
in
the
very
essence
of
him
permeated
by
his
spirit
as
by
an
ether
while
she
was
dreaming
the
minutes
away
thus
a
footstep
came
upon
the
stairs
and
in
a
moment
she
heard
her
husband
heavy
step
on
the
landing
immediately
without
where
are
you
what
possessed
her
she
could
not
have
described
but
with
an
instinctive
objection
to
let
her
husband
know
what
she
had
been
doing
she
slipped
the
photograph
under
the
pillow
just
as
he
flung
open
the
door
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
dined
not
badly
i
beg

and
he
came
forward
into
the
room
while
her
eyes
followed
his
movements
ella
softly
pushed
the
photograph
further
out
of
sight
you

ill
he
asked
bending
over
her
only
wicked
mind
that
and
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
next
morning
marchmill
was
called
at
six
and
in
waking
and
yawning
she
heard
him
muttering
to
himself
the
deuce
is
this
that
been
crackling
under
me
so
imagining
her
asleep
he
searched
round
him
and
withdrew
something
through
her
eyes
she
perceived
it
to
be
trewe
i
damned
her
husband
exclaimed

said
she

awake

ha

mean
bloke

friend
of
our
landlady
i
suppose
i
wonder
how
it

here
whisked
off
the
table
by
accident
perhaps
when
they
were
making
the
bed
was
looking
at
it
yesterday
and
it
must
have
dropped
in
then
he
a
friend
of
yours
bless
his
picturesque
heart
ella
loyalty
to
the
object
of
her
admiration
could
not
endure
to
hear
him
ridiculed
a
clever
man
she
said
with
a
tremor
in
her
gentle
voice
which
she
herself
felt
to
be
absurdly
uncalled
for
is
a
rising
poet
the
gentleman
who
occupied
two
of
these
rooms
before
we
came
though
i
never
seen
him
do
you
know
if
you
never
seen
him
hooper
told
me
when
she
showed
me
the
photograph
well
i
must
up
and
be
off
i
shall
be
home
rather
early
sorry
i
ca
take
you
dear
mind
the
children
do
go
getting
drowned
that
day
marchmill
inquired
if
trewe
were
likely
to
call
at
any
other
time
said
hooper
coming
this
day
week
to
stay
with
a
friend
near
here
till
you
leave
he
be
sure
to
call
marchmill
did
return
quite
early
in
the
afternoon
and
opening
some
letters
which
had
arrived
in
his
absence
declared
suddenly
that
he
and
his
family
would
have
to
leave
a
week
earlier
than
they
had
expected
to
do
in
short
in
three
days
we
can
stay
a
week
longer
she
pleaded
like
it
here
do
it
is
getting
rather
slow
you
might
leave
me
and
the
children
perverse
you
are
ell
what
the
use
and
have
to
come
to
fetch
you
no
we
all
return
together
and
we
make
out
our
time
in
north
wales
or
brighton
a
little
later
on
besides
you
three
days
longer
yet
it
seemed
to
be
her
doom
not
to
meet
the
man
for
whose
rival
talent
she
had
a
despairing
admiration
and
to
whose
person
she
was
now
absolutely
attached
yet
she
determined
to
make
a
last
effort
and
having
gathered
from
her
landlady
that
trewe
was
living
in
a
lonely
spot
not
far
from
the
fashionable
town
on
the
island
opposite
she
crossed
over
in
the
packet
from
the
neighbouring
pier
the
following
afternoon
what
a
useless
journey
it
was
ella
knew
but
vaguely
where
the
house
stood
and
when
she
fancied
she
had
found
it
and
ventured
to
inquire
of
a
pedestrian
if
he
lived
there
the
answer
returned
by
the
man
was
that
he
did
not
know
and
if
he
did
live
there
how
could
she
call
upon
him
some
women
might
have
the
assurance
to
do
it
but
she
had
not
how
crazy
he
would
think
her
she
might
have
asked
him
to
call
upon
her
perhaps
but
she
had
not
the
courage
for
that
either
she
lingered
mournfully
about
the
picturesque
seaside
eminence
till
it
was
time
to
return
to
the
town
and
enter
the
steamer
for
recrossing
reaching
home
for
dinner
without
having
been
greatly
missed
at
the
last
moment
unexpectedly
enough
her
husband
said
that
he
should
have
no
objection
to
letting
her
and
the
children
stay
on
till
the
end
of
the
week
since
she
wished
to
do
so
if
she
felt
herself
able
to
get
home
without
him
she
concealed
the
pleasure
this
extension
of
time
gave
her
and
marchmill
went
off
the
next
morning
alone
but
the
week
passed
and
trewe
did
not
call
on
saturday
morning
the
remaining
members
of
the
marchmill
family
departed
from
the
place
which
had
been
productive
of
so
much
fervour
in
her
the
dreary
dreary
train
the
sun
shining
in
moted
beams
upon
the
hot
cushions
the
dusty
permanent
way
the
mean
rows
of
wire
these
things
were
her
accompaniment
while
out
of
the
window
the
deep
blue
levels
disappeared
from
her
gaze
and
with
them
her
poet
home
hearted
she
tried
to
read
and
wept
instead
marchmill
was
in
a
thriving
way
of
business
and
he
and
his
family
lived
in
a
large
new
house
which
stood
in
rather
extensive
grounds
a
few
miles
outside
the
city
wherein
he
carried
on
his
trade
ella
life
was
lonely
here
as
the
suburban
life
is
apt
to
be
particularly
at
certain
seasons
and
she
had
ample
time
to
indulge
her
taste
for
lyric
and
elegiac
composition
she
had
hardly
got
back
when
she
encountered
a
piece
by
robert
trewe
in
the
new
number
of
her
favourite
magazine
which
must
have
been
written
almost
immediately
before
her
visit
to
solentsea
for
it
contained
the
very
couplet
she
had
seen
pencilled
on
the
wallpaper
by
the
bed
and
hooper
had
declared
to
be
recent
ella
could
resist
no
longer
but
seizing
a
pen
impulsively
wrote
to
him
as
a
using
the
name
of
john
ivy
congratulating
him
in
her
letter
on
his
triumphant
executions
in
metre
and
rhythm
of
thoughts
that
moved
his
soul
as
compared
with
her
own
efforts
in
the
same
pathetic
trade
to
this
address
there
came
a
response
in
a
few
days
little
as
she
had
dared
to
hope
for
it
a
civil
and
brief
note
in
which
the
young
poet
stated
that
though
he
was
not
well
acquainted
with
ivy
verse
he
recalled
the
name
as
being
one
he
had
seen
attached
to
some
very
promising
pieces
that
he
was
glad
to
gain
ivy
acquaintance
by
letter
and
should
certainly
look
with
much
interest
for
his
productions
in
the
future
there
must
have
been
something
juvenile
or
timid
in
her
own
epistle
as
one
ostensibly
coming
from
a
man
she
declared
to
herself
for
trewe
quite
adopted
the
tone
of
an
elder
and
superior
in
this
reply
but
what
did
it
matter
he
had
replied
he
had
written
to
her
with
his
own
hand
from
that
very
room
she
knew
so
well
for
he
was
now
back
again
in
his
quarters
the
correspondence
thus
begun
was
continued
for
two
months
or
more
ella
marchmill
sending
him
from
time
to
time
some
that
she
considered
to
be
the
best
of
her
pieces
which
he
very
kindly
accepted
though
he
did
not
say
he
sedulously
read
them
nor
did
he
send
her
any
of
his
own
in
return
ella
would
have
been
more
hurt
at
this
than
she
was
if
she
had
not
known
that
trewe
laboured
under
the
impression
that
she
was
one
of
his
own
sex
yet
the
situation
was
unsatisfactory
a
flattering
little
voice
told
her
that
were
he
only
to
see
her
matters
would
be
otherwise
no
doubt
she
would
have
helped
on
this
by
making
a
frank
confession
of
womanhood
to
begin
with
if
something
had
not
happened
to
her
delight
to
render
it
unnecessary
a
friend
of
her
husband
the
editor
of
the
most
important
newspaper
in
the
city
and
county
who
was
dining
with
them
one
day
observed
during
their
conversation
about
the
poet
that
his
the
editor
brother
the
was
a
friend
of
trewe
and
that
the
two
men
were
at
that
very
moment
in
wales
together
ella
was
slightly
acquainted
with
the
editor
brother
the
next
morning
down
she
sat
and
wrote
inviting
him
to
stay
at
her
house
for
a
short
time
on
his
way
back
and
requesting
him
to
bring
with
him
if
practicable
his
companion
trewe
whose
acquaintance
she
was
anxious
to
make
the
answer
arrived
after
some
few
days
her
correspondent
and
his
friend
trewe
would
have
much
satisfaction
in
accepting
her
invitation
on
their
way
southward
which
would
be
on
such
and
such
a
day
in
the
following
week
ella
was
blithe
and
buoyant
her
scheme
had
succeeded
her
beloved
though
as
yet
unseen
one
was
coming
behold
he
standeth
behind
our
wall
he
looked
forth
at
the
windows
showing
himself
through
the
lattice
she
thought
ecstatically
and
lo
the
winter
is
past
the
rain
is
over
and
gone
the
flowers
appear
on
the
earth
the
time
of
the
singing
of
birds
is
come
and
the
voice
of
the
turtle
is
heard
in
our
land
but
it
was
necessary
to
consider
the
details
of
lodging
and
feeding
him
this
she
did
most
solicitously
and
awaited
the
pregnant
day
and
hour
it
was
about
five
in
the
afternoon
when
she
heard
a
ring
at
the
door
and
the
editor
brother
voice
in
the
hall
poetess
as
she
was
or
as
she
thought
herself
she
had
not
been
too
sublime
that
day
to
dress
with
infinite
trouble
in
a
fashionable
robe
of
rich
material
having
a
faint
resemblance
to
the
chiton
of
the
greeks
a
style
just
then
in
vogue
among
ladies
of
an
artistic
and
romantic
turn
which
had
been
obtained
by
ella
of
her
bond
street
dressmaker
when
she
was
last
in
london
her
visitor
entered
the
she
looked
towards
his
rear
nobody
else
came
through
the
door
where
in
the
name
of
the
god
of
love
was
robert
trewe
i
sorry
said
the
painter
after
their
introductory
words
had
been
spoken
is
a
curious
fellow
you
know
marchmill
he
said
he
come
then
he
said
he
could
he
rather
dusty
we
been
doing
a
few
miles
with
knapsacks
you
know
and
he
wanted
to
get
on
home
he
not
coming
not
and
he
asked
me
to
make
his
apologies
did
you
from
him
she
asked
her
nether
lip
starting
off
quivering
so
much
that
it
was
like
a
opened
in
her
speech
she
longed
to
run
away
from
this
dreadful
bore
and
cry
her
eyes
out
now
in
the
turnpike
road
yonder
there
he
has
actually
gone
past
my
gates
when
we
got
to
them
handsome
gates
they
are
too
the
finest
bit
of
modern
work
i
have
seen
when
we
came
to
them
we
stopped
talking
there
a
little
while
and
then
he
wished
me
and
went
on
the
truth
is
he
a
little
bit
depressed
just
now
and
does
want
to
see
anybody
he
a
very
good
fellow
and
a
warm
friend
but
a
little
uncertain
and
gloomy
sometimes
he
thinks
too
much
of
things
his
poetry
is
rather
too
erotic
and
passionate
you
know
for
some
tastes
and
he
has
just
come
in
for
a
terrible
slating
from
the
review
that
was
published
yesterday
he
saw
a
copy
of
it
at
the
station
by
accident
perhaps
you
read
it
much
the
better
o
it
is
not
worth
thinking
of
just
one
of
those
articles
written
to
order
to
please
the
set
of
subscribers
upon
whom
the
circulation
depends
but
he
upset
by
it
he
says
it
is
the
misrepresentation
that
hurts
him
so
that
though
he
can
stand
a
fair
attack
he
ca
stand
lies
that
he
powerless
to
refute
and
stop
from
spreading
that
just
trewe
weak
point
he
lives
so
much
by
himself
that
these
things
affect
him
much
more
than
they
would
if
he
were
in
the
bustle
of
fashionable
or
commercial
life
so
he
would
come
here
making
the
excuse
that
it
all
looked
so
new
and
monied
if
pardon
he
must
have
known
there
was
sympathy
here
has
he
never
said
anything
about
getting
letters
from
this
address
yes
he
has
from
john
ivy
perhaps
a
relative
of
yours
he
thought
visiting
here
at
the
time
he
like
ivy
did
he
say
i
do
know
that
he
took
any
great
interest
in
ivy
in
his
poems
in
his
poems
so
far
as
i
know
that
is
robert
trewe
took
no
interest
in
her
house
in
her
poems
or
in
their
writer
as
soon
as
she
could
get
away
she
went
into
the
nursery
and
tried
to
let
off
her
emotion
by
unnecessarily
kissing
the
children
till
she
had
a
sudden
sense
of
disgust
at
being
reminded
how
they
were
like
their
father
the
obtuse
and
never
once
perceived
from
her
conversation
that
it
was
only
trewe
she
wanted
and
not
himself
he
made
the
best
of
his
visit
seeming
to
enjoy
the
society
of
husband
who
also
took
a
great
fancy
to
him
and
showed
him
everywhere
about
the
neighbourhood
neither
of
them
noticing
ella
mood
the
painter
had
been
gone
only
a
day
or
two
when
while
sitting
upstairs
alone
one
morning
she
glanced
over
the
london
paper
just
arrived
and
read
the
following
paragraph
of
a
poet
robert
trewe
who
has
been
favourably
known
for
some
years
as
one
of
our
rising
lyrists
committed
suicide
at
his
lodgings
at
solentsea
on
saturday
evening
last
by
shooting
himself
in
the
right
temple
with
a
revolver
readers
hardly
need
to
be
reminded
that
trewe
has
recently
attracted
the
attention
of
a
much
wider
public
than
had
hitherto
known
him
by
his
new
volume
of
verse
mostly
of
an
impassioned
kind
entitled
lyrics
to
a
woman
unknown
which
has
been
already
favourably
noticed
in
these
pages
for
the
extraordinary
gamut
of
feeling
it
traverses
and
which
has
been
made
the
subject
of
a
severe
if
not
ferocious
criticism
in
the
review
it
is
supposed
though
not
certainly
known
that
the
article
may
have
partially
conduced
to
the
sad
act
as
a
copy
of
the
review
in
question
was
found
on
his
and
he
has
been
observed
to
be
in
a
somewhat
depressed
state
of
mind
since
the
critique
appeared
then
came
the
report
of
the
inquest
at
which
the
following
letter
was
read
it
having
been
addressed
to
a
friend
at
a
distance
before
these
lines
reach
your
hands
i
shall
be
delivered
from
the
inconveniences
of
seeing
hearing
and
knowing
more
of
the
things
around
me
i
will
not
trouble
you
by
giving
my
reasons
for
the
step
i
have
taken
though
i
can
assure
you
they
were
sound
and
logical
perhaps
had
i
been
blessed
with
a
mother
or
a
sister
or
a
female
friend
of
another
sort
tenderly
devoted
to
me
i
might
have
thought
it
worth
while
to
continue
my
present
existence
i
have
long
dreamt
of
such
an
unattainable
creature
as
you
know
and
she
this
undiscoverable
elusive
one
inspired
my
last
volume
the
imaginary
woman
alone
for
in
spite
of
what
has
been
said
in
some
quarters
there
is
no
real
woman
behind
the
title
she
has
continued
to
the
last
unrevealed
unmet
unwon
i
think
it
desirable
to
mention
this
in
order
that
no
blame
may
attach
to
any
real
woman
as
having
been
the
cause
of
my
decease
by
cruel
or
cavalier
treatment
of
me
tell
my
landlady
that
i
am
sorry
to
have
caused
her
this
unpleasantness
but
my
occupancy
of
the
rooms
will
soon
be
forgotten
there
are
ample
funds
in
my
name
at
the
bank
to
pay
all
expenses
r
trewe
ella
sat
for
a
while
as
if
stunned
then
rushed
into
the
adjoining
chamber
and
flung
herself
upon
her
face
on
the
bed
her
grief
and
distraction
shook
her
to
pieces
and
she
lay
in
this
frenzy
of
sorrow
for
more
than
an
hour
broken
words
came
every
now
and
then
from
her
quivering
lips
if
he
had
only
known
of
me
known
of
me
me
o
if
i
had
only
once
met
him
only
once
and
put
my
hand
upon
his
hot
forehead
kissed
him
let
him
know
how
i
loved
him
that
i
would
have
suffered
shame
and
scorn
would
have
lived
and
died
for
him
perhaps
it
would
have
saved
his
dear
life
but
no
it
was
not
allowed
god
is
a
jealous
god
and
that
happiness
was
not
for
him
and
me
all
possibilities
were
over
the
meeting
was
stultified
yet
it
was
almost
visible
to
her
in
her
fantasy
even
now
though
it
could
never
be
substantiated
hour
which
might
have
been
yet
might
not
be
which
man
and
woman
heart
conceived
and
bore
yet
whereof
life
was
barren
she
wrote
to
the
landlady
at
solentsea
in
the
third
person
in
as
subdued
a
style
as
she
could
command
enclosing
a
postal
order
for
a
sovereign
and
informing
hooper
that
marchmill
had
seen
in
the
papers
the
sad
account
of
the
poet
death
and
having
been
as
hooper
was
aware
much
interested
in
trewe
during
her
stay
at
coburg
house
she
would
be
obliged
if
hooper
could
obtain
a
small
portion
of
his
hair
before
his
coffin
was
closed
down
and
send
it
her
as
a
memorial
of
him
as
also
the
photograph
that
was
in
the
frame
by
the
a
letter
arrived
containing
what
had
been
requested
ella
wept
over
the
portrait
and
secured
it
in
her
private
drawer
the
lock
of
hair
she
tied
with
white
ribbon
and
put
in
her
bosom
whence
she
drew
it
and
kissed
it
every
now
and
then
in
some
unobserved
nook
the
matter
said
her
husband
looking
up
from
his
newspaper
on
one
of
these
occasions
over
something
a
lock
of
hair
whose
is
it
dead
she
murmured
do
want
to
tell
you
will
just
now
unless
you
insist
she
said
a
sob
hanging
heavy
in
her
voice
all
right
you
mind
my
refusing
i
will
tell
you
some
day
does
matter
in
the
least
of
course
he
walked
away
whistling
a
few
bars
of
no
tune
in
particular
and
when
he
had
got
down
to
his
factory
in
the
city
the
subject
came
into
head
again
he
too
was
aware
that
a
suicide
had
taken
place
recently
at
the
house
they
had
occupied
at
solentsea
having
seen
the
volume
of
poems
in
his
wife
hand
of
late
and
heard
fragments
of
the
landlady
conversation
about
trewe
when
they
were
her
tenants
he
all
at
once
said
to
himself
of
course
it
he
how
the
devil
did
she
get
to
know
him
what
sly
animals
women
are
then
he
placidly
dismissed
the
matter
and
went
on
with
his
daily
affairs
by
this
time
ella
at
home
had
come
to
a
determination
hooper
in
sending
the
hair
and
photograph
had
informed
her
of
the
day
of
the
funeral
and
as
the
morning
and
noon
wore
on
an
overpowering
wish
to
know
where
they
were
laying
him
took
possession
of
the
sympathetic
woman
caring
very
little
now
what
her
husband
or
any
one
else
might
think
of
her
eccentricities
she
wrote
marchmill
a
brief
note
stating
that
she
was
called
away
for
the
afternoon
and
evening
but
would
return
on
the
following
morning
this
she
left
on
his
desk
and
having
given
the
same
information
to
the
servants
went
out
of
the
house
on
foot
when
marchmill
reached
home
early
in
the
afternoon
the
servants
looked
anxious
the
nurse
took
him
privately
aside
and
hinted
that
her
mistress
sadness
during
the
past
few
days
had
been
such
that
she
feared
she
had
gone
out
to
drown
herself
marchmill
reflected
upon
the
whole
he
thought
that
she
had
not
done
that
without
saying
whither
he
was
bound
he
also
started
off
telling
them
not
to
sit
up
for
him
he
drove
to
the
and
took
a
ticket
for
solentsea
it
was
dark
when
he
reached
the
place
though
he
had
come
by
a
fast
train
and
he
knew
that
if
his
wife
had
preceded
him
thither
it
could
only
have
been
by
a
slower
train
arriving
not
a
great
while
before
his
own
the
season
at
solentsea
was
now
past
the
parade
was
gloomy
and
the
flys
were
few
and
cheap
he
asked
the
way
to
the
cemetery
and
soon
reached
it
the
gate
was
locked
but
the
keeper
let
him
in
declaring
however
that
there
was
nobody
within
the
precincts
although
it
was
not
late
the
autumnal
darkness
had
now
become
intense
and
he
found
some
difficulty
in
keeping
to
the
serpentine
path
which
led
to
the
quarter
where
as
the
man
had
told
him
the
one
or
two
interments
for
the
day
had
taken
place
he
stepped
upon
the
grass
and
stumbling
over
some
pegs
stooped
now
and
then
to
discern
if
possible
a
figure
against
the
sky
he
could
see
none
but
lighting
on
a
spot
where
the
soil
was
trodden
beheld
a
crouching
object
beside
a
newly
made
grave
she
heard
him
and
sprang
up
how
silly
this
is
he
said
indignantly
away
from
home
i
never
heard
such
a
thing
of
course
i
am
not
jealous
of
this
unfortunate
man
but
it
is
too
ridiculous
that
you
a
married
woman
with
three
children
and
a
fourth
coming
should
go
losing
your
head
like
this
over
a
dead
lover
do
you
know
you
were
locked
in
you
might
not
have
been
able
to
get
out
all
night
she
did
not
answer
hope
it
did
go
far
between
you
and
him
for
your
own
sake
insult
me
will
i
wo
have
any
more
of
this
sort
of
thing
do
you
hear
well
she
said
he
drew
her
arm
within
his
own
and
conducted
her
out
of
the
cemetery
it
was
impossible
to
get
back
that
night
and
not
wishing
to
be
recognized
in
their
present
sorry
condition
he
took
her
to
a
miserable
little
close
to
the
station
whence
they
departed
early
in
the
morning
travelling
almost
without
speaking
under
the
sense
that
it
was
one
of
those
dreary
situations
occurring
in
married
life
which
words
could
not
mend
and
reaching
their
own
door
at
noon
the
months
passed
and
neither
of
the
twain
ever
ventured
to
start
a
conversation
upon
this
episode
ella
seemed
to
be
only
too
frequently
in
a
sad
and
listless
mood
which
might
almost
have
been
called
pining
the
time
was
approaching
when
she
would
have
to
undergo
the
stress
of
childbirth
for
a
fourth
time
and
that
apparently
did
not
tend
to
raise
her
spirits
do
think
i
shall
get
over
it
this
time
she
said
one
day
what
childish
foreboding
why
should
it
be
as
well
now
as
ever
she
shook
her
head
feel
almost
sure
i
am
going
to
die
and
i
should
be
glad
if
it
were
not
for
nelly
and
frank
and
tiny
me
soon
find
somebody
to
fill
my
place
she
murmured
with
a
sad
smile
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
i
assure
you
of
that
you
are
not
thinking
still
about
that
poetical
friend
of
yours
she
neither
admitted
nor
denied
the
charge
am
not
going
to
get
over
my
illness
this
time
she
reiterated
tells
me
i
sha
this
view
of
things
was
rather
a
bad
beginning
as
it
usually
is
and
in
fact
six
weeks
later
in
the
month
of
may
she
was
lying
in
her
room
pulseless
and
bloodless
with
hardly
strength
enough
left
to
follow
up
one
feeble
breath
with
another
the
infant
for
whose
unnecessary
life
she
was
slowly
parting
with
her
own
being
fat
and
well
just
before
her
death
she
spoke
to
marchmill
softly
i
want
to
confess
to
you
the
entire
circumstances
of
that
about
you
know
what
that
time
we
visited
solentsea
i
ca
tell
what
possessed
me
how
i
could
forget
you
so
my
husband
but
i
had
got
into
a
morbid
state
i
thought
you
had
been
unkind
that
you
had
neglected
me
that
you
were
up
to
my
intellectual
level
while
he
was
and
far
above
it
i
wanted
a
fuller
appreciator
perhaps
rather
than
another
lover
she
could
get
no
further
then
for
very
exhaustion
and
she
went
off
in
sudden
collapse
a
few
hours
later
without
having
said
anything
more
to
her
husband
on
the
subject
of
her
love
for
the
poet
william
marchmill
in
truth
like
most
husbands
of
several
years
standing
was
little
disturbed
by
retrospective
jealousies
and
had
not
shown
the
least
anxiety
to
press
her
for
confessions
concerning
a
man
dead
and
gone
beyond
any
power
of
inconveniencing
him
more
but
when
she
had
been
buried
a
couple
of
years
it
chanced
one
day
that
in
turning
over
some
forgotten
papers
that
he
wished
to
destroy
before
his
second
wife
entered
the
house
he
lighted
on
a
lock
of
hair
in
an
envelope
with
the
photograph
of
the
deceased
poet
a
date
being
written
on
the
back
in
his
late
wife
hand
it
was
that
of
the
time
they
spent
at
solentsea
marchmill
looked
long
and
musingly
at
the
hair
and
portrait
for
something
struck
him
fetching
the
little
boy
who
had
been
the
death
of
his
mother
now
a
noisy
toddler
he
took
him
on
his
knee
held
the
lock
of
hair
against
the
child
head
and
set
up
the
photograph
on
the
table
behind
so
that
he
could
closely
compare
the
features
each
countenance
presented
there
were
undoubtedly
strong
traces
of
resemblance
the
dreamy
and
peculiar
expression
of
the
poet
face
sat
as
the
transmitted
idea
upon
the
child
and
the
hair
was
of
the
same
hue
damned
if
i
did
think
so
murmured
marchmill
she
did
play
me
false
with
that
fellow
at
the
lodgings
let
me
see
the
dates
the
second
week
in
august
the
third
week
in
may
yes
yes
get
away
you
poor
little
brat
you
are
nothing
to
me
the
three
strangers
among
the
few
features
of
agricultural
england
which
retain
an
appearance
but
little
modified
by
the
lapse
of
centuries
may
be
reckoned
the
high
grassy
and
furzy
downs
coombs
or
as
they
are
indifferently
called
that
fill
a
large
area
of
certain
counties
in
the
south
and
west
if
any
mark
of
human
occupation
is
met
with
hereon
it
usually
takes
the
form
of
the
solitary
cottage
of
some
shepherd
fifty
years
ago
such
a
lonely
cottage
stood
on
such
a
down
and
may
possibly
be
standing
there
now
in
spite
of
its
loneliness
however
the
spot
by
actual
measurement
was
not
more
than
five
miles
from
a
town
yet
that
affected
it
little
five
miles
of
irregular
upland
during
the
long
inimical
seasons
with
their
sleets
snows
rains
and
mists
afford
withdrawing
space
enough
to
isolate
a
timon
or
a
nebuchadnezzar
much
less
in
fair
weather
to
please
that
less
repellent
tribe
the
poets
philosophers
artists
and
others
who
and
meditate
of
pleasant
things
some
old
earthen
camp
or
barrow
some
clump
of
trees
at
least
some
starved
fragment
of
ancient
hedge
is
usually
taken
advantage
of
in
the
erection
of
these
forlorn
dwellings
but
in
the
present
case
such
a
kind
of
shelter
had
been
disregarded
higher
crowstairs
as
the
house
was
called
stood
quite
detached
and
undefended
the
only
reason
for
its
precise
situation
seemed
to
be
the
crossing
of
two
footpaths
at
right
angles
hard
by
which
may
have
crossed
there
and
thus
for
a
good
five
hundred
years
hence
the
house
was
exposed
to
the
elements
on
all
sides
but
though
the
wind
up
here
blew
unmistakably
when
it
did
blow
and
the
rain
hit
hard
whenever
it
fell
the
various
weathers
of
the
winter
season
were
not
quite
so
formidable
on
the
coomb
as
they
were
imagined
to
be
by
dwellers
on
low
ground
the
raw
rimes
were
not
so
pernicious
as
in
the
hollows
and
the
frosts
were
scarcely
so
severe
when
the
shepherd
and
his
family
who
tenanted
the
house
were
pitied
for
their
sufferings
from
the
exposure
they
said
that
upon
the
whole
they
were
less
inconvenienced
by
and
flames
hoarses
and
phlegms
than
when
they
had
lived
by
the
stream
of
a
snug
neighbouring
valley
the
night
of
march
was
precisely
one
of
the
nights
that
were
wont
to
call
forth
these
expressions
of
commiseration
the
level
rainstorm
smote
walls
slopes
and
hedges
like
the
clothyard
shafts
of
senlac
and
crecy
such
sheep
and
outdoor
animals
as
had
no
shelter
stood
with
their
buttocks
to
the
winds
while
the
tails
of
little
birds
trying
to
roost
on
some
scraggy
thorn
were
blown
like
umbrellas
the
of
the
cottage
was
stained
with
wet
and
the
eavesdroppings
flapped
against
the
wall
yet
never
was
commiseration
for
the
shepherd
more
misplaced
for
that
cheerful
rustic
was
entertaining
a
large
party
in
glorification
of
the
christening
of
his
second
girl
the
guests
had
arrived
before
the
rain
began
to
fall
and
they
were
all
now
assembled
in
the
chief
or
living
room
of
the
dwelling
a
glance
into
the
apartment
at
eight
on
this
eventful
evening
would
have
resulted
in
the
opinion
that
it
was
as
cosy
and
comfortable
a
nook
as
could
be
wished
for
in
boisterous
weather
the
calling
of
its
inhabitant
was
proclaimed
by
a
number
of
without
stems
that
were
hung
ornamentally
over
the
fireplace
the
curl
of
each
shining
crook
varying
from
the
antiquated
type
engraved
in
the
patriarchal
pictures
of
old
family
bibles
to
the
most
approved
fashion
of
the
last
local
the
room
was
lighted
by
candles
having
wicks
only
a
trifle
smaller
than
the
grease
which
enveloped
them
in
candlesticks
that
were
never
used
but
at
and
family
feasts
the
lights
were
scattered
about
the
room
two
of
them
standing
on
the
this
position
of
candles
was
in
itself
significant
candles
on
the
always
meant
a
party
on
the
hearth
in
front
of
a
to
give
substance
blazed
a
fire
of
thorns
that
crackled
the
laughter
of
the
fool
nineteen
persons
were
gathered
here
of
these
five
women
wearing
gowns
of
various
bright
hues
sat
in
chairs
along
the
wall
girls
shy
and
not
shy
filled
the
four
men
including
charley
jake
the
carpenter
elijah
new
the
and
john
pitcher
a
neighbouring
dairyman
the
shepherd
lolled
in
the
settle
a
young
man
and
maid
who
were
blushing
over
tentative
pourparlers
on
a
sat
beneath
the
and
an
elderly
engaged
man
of
fifty
or
upward
moved
restlessly
about
from
spots
where
his
betrothed
was
not
to
the
spot
where
she
was
enjoyment
was
pretty
general
and
so
much
the
more
prevailed
in
being
unhampered
by
conventional
restrictions
absolute
confidence
in
each
other
good
opinion
begat
perfect
ease
while
the
finishing
stroke
of
manner
amounting
to
a
truly
princely
serenity
was
lent
to
the
majority
by
the
absence
of
any
expression
or
trait
denoting
that
they
wished
to
get
on
in
the
world
enlarge
their
minds
or
do
any
eclipsing
thing
whatever
which
nowadays
so
generally
nips
the
bloom
and
bonhomie
of
all
except
the
two
extremes
of
the
social
scale
shepherd
fennel
had
married
well
his
wife
being
a
dairyman
daughter
from
a
vale
at
a
distance
who
brought
fifty
guineas
in
her
pocket
and
kept
them
there
till
they
should
be
required
for
ministering
to
the
needs
of
a
coming
family
this
frugal
woman
had
been
somewhat
exercised
as
to
the
character
that
should
be
given
to
the
gathering
a
party
had
its
advantages
but
an
undisturbed
position
of
ease
in
chairs
and
settles
was
apt
to
lead
on
the
men
to
such
an
unconscionable
deal
of
toping
that
they
would
sometimes
fairly
drink
the
house
dry
a
party
was
the
alternative
but
this
while
avoiding
the
foregoing
objection
on
the
score
of
good
drink
had
a
counterbalancing
disadvantage
in
the
matter
of
good
victuals
the
ravenous
appetites
engendered
by
the
exercise
causing
immense
havoc
in
the
buttery
shepherdess
fennel
fell
back
upon
the
intermediate
plan
of
mingling
short
dances
with
short
periods
of
talk
and
singing
so
as
to
hinder
any
ungovernable
rage
in
either
but
this
scheme
was
entirely
confined
to
her
own
gentle
mind
the
shepherd
himself
was
in
the
mood
to
exhibit
the
most
reckless
phases
of
hospitality
the
fiddler
was
a
boy
of
those
parts
about
twelve
years
of
age
who
had
a
wonderful
dexterity
in
jigs
and
reels
though
his
fingers
were
so
small
and
short
as
to
necessitate
a
constant
shifting
for
the
high
notes
from
which
he
scrambled
back
to
the
first
position
with
sounds
not
of
unmixed
purity
of
tone
at
seven
the
shrill
of
this
youngster
had
begun
accompanied
by
a
booming
from
elijah
new
the
clerk
who
had
thoughtfully
brought
with
him
his
favourite
musical
instrument
the
serpent
dancing
was
instantaneous
fennel
privately
enjoining
the
players
on
no
account
to
let
the
dance
exceed
the
length
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
but
elijah
and
the
boy
in
the
excitement
of
their
position
quite
forgot
the
injunction
moreover
oliver
giles
a
man
of
seventeen
one
of
the
dancers
who
was
enamoured
of
his
partner
a
fair
girl
of
rolling
years
had
recklessly
handed
a
new
to
the
musicians
as
a
bribe
to
keep
going
as
long
as
they
had
muscle
and
wind
fennel
seeing
the
steam
begin
to
generate
on
the
countenances
of
her
guests
crossed
over
and
touched
the
fiddler
elbow
and
put
her
hand
on
the
serpent
mouth
but
they
took
no
notice
and
fearing
she
might
lose
her
character
of
genial
hostess
if
she
were
to
interfere
too
markedly
she
retired
and
sat
down
helpless
and
so
the
dance
whizzed
on
with
cumulative
fury
the
performers
moving
in
their
courses
direct
and
retrograde
from
apogee
to
perigee
till
the
hand
of
the
kicked
clock
at
the
bottom
of
the
room
had
travelled
over
the
circumference
of
an
hour
while
these
cheerful
events
were
in
course
of
enactment
within
pastoral
dwelling
an
incident
having
considerable
bearing
on
the
party
had
occurred
in
the
gloomy
night
without
fennel
concern
about
the
growing
fierceness
of
the
dance
corresponded
in
point
of
time
with
the
ascent
of
a
human
figure
to
the
solitary
hill
of
higher
crowstairs
from
the
direction
of
the
distant
town
this
personage
strode
on
through
the
rain
without
a
pause
following
the
path
which
further
on
in
its
course
skirted
the
shepherd
cottage
it
was
nearly
the
time
of
full
moon
and
on
this
account
though
the
sky
was
lined
with
a
uniform
sheet
of
dripping
cloud
ordinary
objects
out
of
doors
were
readily
visible
the
sad
wan
light
revealed
the
lonely
pedestrian
to
be
a
man
of
supple
frame
his
gait
suggested
that
he
had
somewhat
passed
the
period
of
perfect
and
instinctive
agility
though
not
so
far
as
to
be
otherwise
than
rapid
of
motion
when
occasion
required
at
a
rough
guess
he
might
have
been
about
forty
years
of
age
he
appeared
tall
but
a
recruiting
sergeant
or
other
person
accustomed
to
the
judging
of
men
heights
by
the
eye
would
have
discerned
that
this
was
chiefly
owing
to
his
gauntness
and
that
he
was
not
more
than
eight
or
nine
notwithstanding
the
regularity
of
his
tread
there
was
caution
in
it
as
in
that
of
one
who
mentally
feels
his
way
and
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
not
a
black
coat
nor
a
dark
garment
of
any
sort
that
he
wore
there
was
something
about
him
which
suggested
that
he
naturally
belonged
to
the
tribes
of
men
his
clothes
were
of
fustian
and
his
boots
hobnailed
yet
in
his
progress
he
showed
not
the
bearing
of
hobnailed
and
fustianed
peasantry
by
the
time
that
he
had
arrived
abreast
of
the
shepherd
premises
the
rain
came
down
or
rather
came
along
with
yet
more
determined
violence
the
outskirts
of
the
little
settlement
partially
broke
the
force
of
wind
and
rain
and
this
induced
him
to
stand
still
the
most
salient
of
the
shepherd
domestic
erections
was
an
empty
sty
at
the
forward
corner
of
his
hedgeless
garden
for
in
these
latitudes
the
principle
of
masking
the
homelier
features
of
your
establishment
by
a
conventional
frontage
was
unknown
the
traveller
eye
was
attracted
to
this
small
building
by
the
pallid
shine
of
the
wet
slates
that
covered
it
he
turned
aside
and
finding
it
empty
stood
under
the
for
shelter
while
he
stood
the
boom
of
the
serpent
within
the
adjacent
house
and
the
lesser
strains
of
the
fiddler
reached
the
spot
as
an
accompaniment
to
the
surging
hiss
of
the
flying
rain
on
the
sod
its
louder
beating
on
the
of
the
garden
on
the
eight
or
ten
beehives
just
discernible
by
the
path
and
its
dripping
from
the
eaves
into
a
row
of
buckets
and
pans
that
had
been
placed
under
the
walls
of
the
cottage
for
at
higher
crowstairs
as
at
all
such
elevated
domiciles
the
grand
difficulty
of
housekeeping
was
an
insufficiency
of
water
and
a
casual
rainfall
was
utilized
by
turning
out
as
catchers
every
utensil
that
the
house
contained
some
queer
stories
might
be
told
of
the
contrivances
for
economy
in
suds
and
that
are
absolutely
necessitated
in
upland
habitations
during
the
droughts
of
summer
but
at
this
season
there
were
no
such
exigencies
a
mere
acceptance
of
what
the
skies
bestowed
was
sufficient
for
an
abundant
store
at
last
the
notes
of
the
serpent
ceased
and
the
house
was
silent
this
cessation
of
activity
aroused
the
solitary
pedestrian
from
the
reverie
into
which
he
had
lapsed
and
emerging
from
the
shed
with
an
apparently
new
intention
he
walked
up
the
path
to
the
arrived
here
his
first
act
was
to
kneel
down
on
a
large
stone
beside
the
row
of
vessels
and
to
drink
a
copious
draught
from
one
of
them
having
quenched
his
thirst
he
rose
and
lifted
his
hand
to
knock
but
paused
with
his
eye
upon
the
panel
since
the
dark
surface
of
the
wood
revealed
absolutely
nothing
it
was
evident
that
he
must
be
mentally
looking
through
the
door
as
if
he
wished
to
measure
thereby
all
the
possibilities
that
a
house
of
this
sort
might
include
and
how
they
might
bear
upon
the
question
of
his
entry
in
his
indecision
he
turned
and
surveyed
the
scene
around
not
a
soul
was
anywhere
visible
the
stretched
downward
from
his
feet
gleaming
like
the
track
of
a
snail
the
roof
of
the
little
well
mostly
dry
the
the
top
rail
of
the
were
varnished
with
the
same
dull
liquid
glaze
while
far
away
in
the
vale
a
faint
whiteness
of
more
than
usual
extent
showed
that
the
rivers
were
high
in
the
meads
beyond
all
this
winked
a
few
bleared
lamplights
through
the
beating
drops
lights
that
denoted
the
situation
of
the
from
which
he
had
appeared
to
come
the
absence
of
all
notes
of
life
in
that
direction
seemed
to
clinch
his
intentions
and
he
knocked
at
the
door
within
a
desultory
chat
had
taken
the
place
of
movement
and
musical
sound
the
was
suggesting
a
song
to
the
company
which
nobody
just
then
was
inclined
to
undertake
so
that
the
knock
afforded
a
not
unwelcome
diversion
in
said
the
shepherd
promptly
the
latch
clicked
upward
and
out
of
the
night
our
pedestrian
appeared
upon
the
the
shepherd
arose
snuffed
two
of
the
nearest
candles
and
turned
to
look
at
him
their
light
disclosed
that
the
stranger
was
dark
in
complexion
and
not
unprepossessing
as
to
feature
his
hat
which
for
a
moment
he
did
not
remove
hung
low
over
his
eyes
without
concealing
that
they
were
large
open
and
determined
moving
with
a
flash
rather
than
a
glance
round
the
room
he
seemed
pleased
with
his
survey
and
baring
his
shaggy
head
said
in
a
rich
deep
voice
rain
is
so
heavy
friends
that
i
ask
leave
to
come
in
and
rest
awhile
be
sure
stranger
said
the
shepherd
faith
you
been
lucky
in
choosing
your
time
for
we
are
having
a
bit
of
a
fling
for
a
glad
cause
though
to
be
sure
a
man
could
hardly
wish
that
glad
cause
to
happen
more
than
once
a
year
less
spoke
up
a
woman
is
best
to
get
your
family
over
and
done
with
as
soon
as
you
can
so
as
to
be
all
the
earlier
out
of
the
fag
what
may
be
this
glad
cause
asked
the
stranger
birth
and
christening
said
the
shepherd
the
stranger
hoped
his
host
might
not
be
made
unhappy
either
by
too
many
or
too
few
of
such
episodes
and
being
invited
by
a
gesture
to
a
pull
at
the
mug
he
readily
acquiesced
his
manner
which
before
entering
had
been
so
dubious
was
now
altogether
that
of
a
careless
and
candid
man
to
be
traipsing
athwart
this
coomb
hey
said
the
engaged
man
of
fifty
it
is
master
as
you
i
take
a
seat
in
the
if
you
have
nothing
to
urge
against
it
for
i
am
a
little
moist
on
the
side
that
was
next
the
rain
shepherd
fennel
assented
and
made
room
for
the
comer
who
having
got
completely
inside
the
stretched
out
his
legs
and
his
arms
with
the
expansiveness
of
a
person
quite
at
home
i
am
rather
cracked
in
the
vamp
he
said
freely
seeing
that
the
eyes
of
the
shepherd
wife
fell
upon
his
boots
i
am
not
well
fitted
either
i
have
had
some
rough
times
lately
and
have
been
forced
to
pick
up
what
i
can
get
in
the
way
of
wearing
but
i
must
find
a
suit
better
fit
for
when
i
reach
home
of
hereabouts
she
inquired
quite
that
further
up
the
country
thought
so
and
so
be
i
and
by
your
tongue
you
come
from
my
neighbourhood
you
would
hardly
have
heard
of
me
he
said
quickly
time
would
be
long
before
yours
you
see
this
testimony
to
the
youthfulness
of
his
hostess
had
the
effect
of
stopping
her
is
only
one
thing
more
wanted
to
make
me
happy
continued
the
comer
that
is
a
little
baccy
which
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
am
out
of
fill
your
pipe
said
the
shepherd
must
ask
you
to
lend
me
a
pipe
likewise
smoker
and
no
pipe
about
have
dropped
it
somewhere
on
the
road
the
shepherd
filled
and
handed
him
a
new
clay
pipe
saying
as
he
did
so
me
your
i
fill
that
too
now
i
am
about
it
the
man
went
through
the
movement
of
searching
his
pockets
that
too
said
his
entertainer
with
some
surprise
am
afraid
so
said
the
man
with
some
confusion
it
to
me
in
a
screw
of
paper
lighting
his
pipe
at
the
candle
with
a
suction
that
drew
the
whole
flame
into
the
bowl
he
resettled
himself
in
the
corner
and
bent
his
looks
upon
the
faint
steam
from
his
damp
legs
as
if
he
wished
to
say
no
more
meanwhile
the
general
body
of
guests
had
been
taking
little
notice
of
this
visitor
by
reason
of
an
absorbing
discussion
in
which
they
were
engaged
with
the
band
about
a
tune
for
the
next
dance
the
matter
being
settled
they
were
about
to
stand
up
when
an
interruption
came
in
the
shape
of
another
knock
at
the
door
at
sound
of
the
same
the
man
in
the
took
up
the
poker
and
began
stirring
the
brands
as
if
doing
it
thoroughly
were
the
one
aim
of
his
existence
and
a
second
time
the
shepherd
said
in
in
a
moment
another
man
stood
upon
the
he
too
was
a
stranger
this
individual
was
one
of
a
type
radically
different
from
the
first
there
was
more
of
the
commonplace
in
his
manner
and
a
certain
jovial
cosmopolitanism
sat
upon
his
features
he
was
several
years
older
than
the
first
arrival
his
hair
being
slightly
frosted
his
eyebrows
bristly
and
his
whiskers
cut
back
from
his
cheeks
his
face
was
rather
full
and
flabby
and
yet
it
was
not
altogether
a
face
without
power
a
few
blossoms
marked
the
neighbourhood
of
his
nose
he
flung
back
his
long
drab
greatcoat
revealing
that
beneath
it
he
wore
a
suit
of
shade
throughout
large
heavy
seals
of
some
metal
or
other
that
would
take
a
polish
dangling
from
his
fob
as
his
only
personal
ornament
shaking
the
from
his
glazed
hat
he
said
must
ask
for
a
few
minutes
shelter
comrades
or
i
shall
be
wetted
to
my
skin
before
i
get
to
casterbridge
yourself
at
home
master
said
the
shepherd
perhaps
a
trifle
less
heartily
than
on
the
first
occasion
not
that
fennel
had
the
least
tinge
of
niggardliness
in
his
composition
but
the
room
was
far
from
large
spare
chairs
were
not
numerous
and
damp
companions
were
not
altogether
desirable
at
close
quarters
for
the
women
and
girls
in
their
gowns
however
the
second
comer
after
taking
off
his
greatcoat
and
hanging
his
hat
on
a
nail
in
one
of
the
as
if
he
had
been
specially
invited
to
put
it
there
advanced
and
sat
down
at
the
table
this
had
been
pushed
so
closely
into
the
to
give
all
available
room
to
the
dancers
that
its
inner
edge
grazed
the
elbow
of
the
man
who
had
ensconced
himself
by
the
fire
and
thus
the
two
strangers
were
brought
into
close
companionship
they
nodded
to
each
other
by
way
of
breaking
the
ice
of
unacquaintance
and
the
first
stranger
handed
his
neighbour
the
family
mug
a
huge
vessel
of
brown
ware
having
its
upper
edge
worn
away
like
a
threshold
by
the
rub
of
whole
generations
of
thirsty
lips
that
had
gone
the
way
of
all
flesh
and
bearing
the
following
inscription
burnt
upon
its
rotund
side
in
yellow
letters
there
is
no
fun
untill
i
cum
the
other
man
nothing
loth
raised
the
mug
to
his
lips
and
drank
on
and
on
and
on
till
a
curious
blueness
overspread
the
countenance
of
the
shepherd
wife
who
had
regarded
with
no
little
surprise
the
first
stranger
free
offer
to
the
second
of
what
did
not
belong
to
him
to
dispense
knew
it
said
the
toper
to
the
shepherd
with
much
satisfaction
i
walked
up
your
garden
before
coming
in
and
saw
the
hives
all
of
a
row
i
said
to
myself
where
there
bees
there
honey
and
where
honey
there
mead
but
mead
of
such
a
truly
comfortable
sort
as
this
i
really
did
expect
to
meet
in
my
older
days
he
took
yet
another
pull
at
the
mug
till
it
assumed
an
ominous
elevation
you
enjoy
it
said
the
shepherd
warmly
is
goodish
mead
assented
fennel
with
an
absence
of
enthusiasm
which
seemed
to
say
that
it
was
possible
to
buy
praise
for
one
cellar
at
too
heavy
a
price
is
trouble
enough
to
make
and
really
i
hardly
think
we
shall
make
any
more
for
honey
sells
well
and
we
ourselves
can
make
shift
with
a
drop
o
small
mead
and
metheglin
for
common
use
from
the
but
you
never
have
the
heart
reproachfully
cried
the
stranger
in
after
taking
up
the
mug
a
third
time
and
setting
it
down
empty
love
mead
when
is
old
like
this
as
i
love
to
go
to
church
o
sundays
or
to
relieve
the
needy
any
day
of
the
week
ha
ha
said
the
man
in
the
who
in
spite
of
the
taciturnity
induced
by
the
pipe
of
tobacco
could
not
or
would
not
refrain
from
this
slight
testimony
to
his
comrade
humour
now
the
old
mead
of
those
days
brewed
of
the
purest
or
maiden
honey
four
pounds
to
the
gallon
with
its
due
complement
of
white
of
eggs
cinnamon
ginger
cloves
mace
rosemary
yeast
and
processes
of
working
bottling
and
cellaring
tasted
remarkably
strong
but
it
did
not
taste
so
strong
as
it
actually
was
hence
presently
the
stranger
in
at
the
table
moved
by
its
creeping
influence
unbuttoned
his
waistcoat
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
spread
his
legs
and
made
his
presence
felt
in
various
ways
well
as
i
say
he
resumed
am
going
to
casterbridge
and
to
casterbridge
i
must
go
i
should
have
been
almost
there
by
this
time
but
the
rain
drove
me
into
your
dwelling
and
i
not
sorry
for
it
do
live
in
casterbridge
said
the
shepherd
as
yet
though
i
shortly
mean
to
move
there
to
set
up
in
trade
perhaps
no
said
the
shepherd
wife
is
easy
to
see
that
the
gentleman
is
rich
and
do
want
to
work
at
anything
the
stranger
paused
as
if
to
consider
whether
he
would
accept
that
definition
of
himself
he
presently
rejected
it
by
answering
is
not
quite
the
word
for
me
dame
i
do
work
and
i
must
work
and
even
if
i
only
get
to
casterbridge
by
midnight
i
must
begin
work
there
at
eight
morning
yes
het
or
wet
blow
or
snow
famine
or
sword
my
day
work
must
be
done
man
then
in
spite
o
seeming
you
be
worse
off
than
we
replied
the
shepherd
wife
the
nature
of
my
trade
men
and
maidens
is
the
nature
of
my
trade
more
than
my
poverty
but
really
and
truly
i
must
up
and
off
or
i
sha
get
a
lodging
in
the
town
however
the
speaker
did
not
move
and
directly
added
time
for
one
more
draught
of
friendship
before
i
go
and
i
perform
it
at
once
if
the
mug
were
not
dry
a
mug
o
small
said
fennel
we
call
it
though
to
be
sure
is
only
the
first
wash
o
the
combs
said
the
stranger
disdainfully
wo
spoil
your
first
kindness
by
partaking
o
your
second
not
broke
in
fennel
do
increase
and
multiply
every
day
and
i
fill
the
mug
again
he
went
away
to
the
dark
place
under
the
stairs
where
the
barrel
stood
the
shepherdess
followed
him
should
you
do
this
she
said
reproachfully
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
emptied
it
once
though
it
held
enough
for
ten
people
and
now
he
not
contented
wi
the
small
but
must
needs
call
for
more
o
the
strong
and
a
stranger
unbeknown
to
any
of
us
for
my
part
i
like
the
look
o
the
man
at
all
he
in
the
house
my
honey
and
is
a
wet
night
and
a
christening
daze
it
what
a
cup
of
mead
more
or
less
there
be
plenty
more
next
well
this
time
then
she
answered
looking
wistfully
at
the
barrel
what
is
the
man
calling
and
where
is
he
one
of
that
he
should
come
in
and
join
us
like
this
do
know
i
ask
him
again
the
catastrophe
of
having
the
mug
drained
dry
at
one
pull
by
the
stranger
in
was
effectually
guarded
against
this
time
by
fennel
she
poured
out
his
allowance
in
a
small
cup
keeping
the
large
one
at
a
discreet
distance
from
him
when
he
had
tossed
off
his
portion
the
shepherd
renewed
his
inquiry
about
the
stranger
occupation
the
latter
did
not
immediately
reply
and
the
man
in
the
with
sudden
demonstrativeness
said
may
know
my
trade
i
a
wheelwright
very
good
trade
for
these
parts
said
the
shepherd
anybody
may
know
mine
if
they
the
sense
to
find
it
out
said
the
stranger
in
may
generally
tell
what
a
man
is
by
his
claws
observed
the
carpenter
looking
at
his
own
hands
fingers
be
as
full
of
thorns
as
an
old
is
of
pins
the
hands
of
the
man
in
the
instinctively
sought
the
shade
and
he
gazed
into
the
fire
as
he
resumed
his
pipe
the
man
at
the
table
took
up
the
remark
and
added
smartly
but
the
oddity
of
my
trade
is
that
instead
of
setting
a
mark
upon
me
it
sets
a
mark
upon
my
customers
no
observation
being
offered
by
anybody
in
elucidation
of
this
enigma
the
shepherd
wife
once
more
called
for
a
song
the
same
obstacles
presented
themselves
as
at
the
former
time
one
had
no
voice
another
had
forgotten
the
first
verse
the
stranger
at
the
table
whose
soul
had
now
risen
to
a
good
working
temperature
relieved
the
difficulty
by
exclaiming
that
to
start
the
company
he
would
sing
himself
thrusting
one
thumb
into
the
of
his
waistcoat
he
waved
the
other
hand
in
the
air
and
with
an
extemporizing
gaze
at
the
shining
above
the
mantelpiece
began
my
trade
it
is
the
rarest
one
simple
shepherds
all
my
trade
is
a
sight
to
see
for
my
customers
i
tie
and
take
them
up
on
high
and
waft
to
a
far
countree
the
room
was
silent
when
he
had
finished
the
verse
with
one
exception
that
of
the
man
in
the
who
at
the
singer
word
him
in
a
deep
bass
voice
of
musical
relish
waft
to
a
far
countree
oliver
giles
john
pitcher
the
dairyman
the
the
engaged
man
of
fifty
the
row
of
young
women
against
the
wall
seemed
lost
in
thought
not
of
the
gayest
kind
the
shepherd
looked
meditatively
on
the
ground
the
shepherdess
gazed
keenly
at
the
singer
and
with
some
suspicion
she
was
doubting
whether
this
stranger
were
merely
singing
an
old
song
from
recollection
or
was
composing
one
there
and
then
for
the
occasion
all
were
as
perplexed
at
the
obscure
revelation
as
the
guests
at
belshazzar
feast
except
the
man
in
the
who
quietly
said
verse
stranger
and
smoked
on
the
singer
thoroughly
moistened
himself
from
his
lips
inwards
and
went
on
with
the
next
stanza
as
requested
tools
are
but
common
ones
simple
shepherds
all
my
tools
are
no
sight
to
see
a
little
hempen
string
and
a
post
whereon
to
swing
are
implements
enough
for
me
shepherd
fennel
glanced
round
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
that
the
stranger
was
answering
his
question
rhythmically
the
guests
one
and
all
started
back
with
suppressed
exclamations
the
young
woman
engaged
to
the
man
of
fifty
fainted
and
would
have
proceeded
but
finding
him
wanting
in
alacrity
for
catching
her
she
sat
down
trembling
he
the
whispered
the
people
in
the
background
mentioning
the
name
of
an
ominous
public
officer
come
to
do
it
is
to
be
at
casterbridge
jail
the
man
for
the
poor
maker
we
heard
of
who
used
to
live
away
at
shottsford
and
had
no
work
to
do
timothy
summers
whose
family
were
and
so
he
went
out
of
shottsford
by
the
and
took
a
sheep
in
open
daylight
defying
the
farmer
and
the
farmer
wife
and
the
farmer
lad
and
every
man
jack
among
he
and
they
nodded
towards
the
stranger
of
the
deadly
trade
come
from
up
the
country
to
do
it
because
there
not
enough
to
do
in
his
own
and
he
got
the
place
here
now
our
own
county
man
dead
he
going
to
live
in
the
same
cottage
under
the
prison
wall
the
stranger
in
took
no
notice
of
this
whispered
string
of
observations
but
again
wetted
his
lips
seeing
that
his
friend
in
the
was
the
only
one
who
reciprocated
his
joviality
in
any
way
he
held
out
his
cup
towards
that
appreciative
comrade
who
also
held
out
his
own
they
clinked
together
the
eyes
of
the
rest
of
the
room
hanging
upon
the
singer
actions
he
parted
his
lips
for
the
third
verse
but
at
that
moment
another
knock
was
audible
upon
the
door
this
time
the
knock
was
faint
and
hesitating
the
company
seemed
scared
the
shepherd
looked
with
consternation
towards
the
entrance
and
it
was
with
some
effort
that
he
resisted
his
alarmed
wife
deprecatory
glance
and
uttered
for
the
third
time
the
welcoming
words
in
the
door
was
gently
opened
and
another
man
stood
upon
the
mat
he
like
those
who
had
preceded
him
was
a
stranger
this
time
it
was
a
short
small
personage
of
fair
complexion
and
dressed
in
a
decent
suit
of
dark
clothes
you
tell
me
the
way
to
he
began
when
gazing
round
the
room
to
observe
the
nature
of
the
company
amongst
whom
he
had
fallen
his
eyes
lighted
on
the
stranger
in
it
was
just
at
the
instant
when
the
latter
who
had
thrown
his
mind
into
his
song
with
such
a
will
that
he
scarcely
heeded
the
interruption
silenced
all
whispers
and
inquiries
by
bursting
into
his
third
verse
is
my
working
day
simple
shepherds
all
is
a
working
day
for
me
for
the
farmer
sheep
is
slain
and
the
lad
who
did
it
and
on
his
soul
may
god
ha
the
stranger
in
the
waving
cups
with
the
singer
so
heartily
that
his
mead
splashed
over
on
the
hearth
repeated
in
his
bass
voice
as
before
on
his
soul
may
god
ha
all
this
time
the
third
stranger
had
been
standing
in
the
doorway
finding
now
that
he
did
not
come
forward
or
go
on
speaking
the
guests
particularly
regarded
him
they
noticed
to
their
surprise
that
he
stood
before
them
the
picture
of
abject
terror
his
knees
trembling
his
hand
shaking
so
violently
that
the
by
which
he
supported
himself
rattled
audibly
his
white
lips
were
parted
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
merry
officer
of
justice
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
moment
more
and
he
had
turned
closed
the
door
and
fled
a
man
can
it
be
said
the
shepherd
the
rest
between
the
awfulness
of
their
late
discovery
and
the
odd
conduct
of
this
third
visitor
looked
as
if
they
knew
not
what
to
think
and
said
nothing
instinctively
they
withdrew
further
and
further
from
the
grim
gentleman
in
their
midst
whom
some
of
them
seemed
to
take
for
the
prince
of
darkness
himself
till
they
formed
a
remote
circle
an
empty
space
of
floor
being
left
between
them
and
him
circulus
cujus
centrum
diabolus
the
room
was
so
silent
though
there
were
more
than
twenty
people
in
it
that
nothing
could
be
heard
but
the
patter
of
the
rain
against
the
accompanied
by
the
occasional
hiss
of
a
stray
drop
that
fell
down
the
chimney
into
the
fire
and
the
steady
puffing
of
the
man
in
the
corner
who
had
now
resumed
his
pipe
of
long
clay
the
stillness
was
unexpectedly
broken
the
distant
sound
of
a
gun
reverberated
through
the
air
apparently
from
the
direction
of
the
town
jiggered
cried
the
stranger
who
had
sung
the
song
jumping
up
does
that
mean
asked
several
prisoner
escaped
from
the
jail
that
what
it
means
all
listened
the
sound
was
repeated
and
none
of
them
spoke
but
the
man
in
the
who
said
quietly
often
been
told
that
in
this
county
they
fire
a
gun
at
such
times
but
i
never
heard
it
till
now
wonder
if
it
is
my
man
murmured
the
personage
in
it
is
said
the
shepherd
involuntarily
surely
we
zeed
him
that
little
man
who
looked
in
at
the
door
by
now
and
quivered
like
a
leaf
when
he
zeed
ye
and
heard
your
song
teeth
chattered
and
the
breath
went
out
of
his
body
said
the
dairyman
his
heart
seemed
to
sink
within
him
like
a
stone
said
oliver
giles
he
bolted
as
if
he
been
shot
at
said
the
his
teeth
chattered
and
his
heart
seemed
to
sink
and
he
bolted
as
if
he
been
shot
at
slowly
summed
up
the
man
in
the
did
notice
it
remarked
the
hangman
were
all
what
made
him
run
off
in
such
a
fright
faltered
one
of
the
women
against
the
wall
now
is
explained
the
firing
of
the
went
on
at
intervals
low
and
sullenly
and
their
suspicions
became
a
certainty
the
sinister
gentleman
in
gray
roused
himself
there
a
constable
here
he
asked
in
thick
tones
so
let
him
step
forward
the
engaged
man
of
fifty
stepped
quavering
out
from
the
wall
his
betrothed
beginning
to
sob
on
the
back
of
the
chair
are
a
sworn
constable
be

the
criminal
at
once
with
assistance
and
bring

i
will
when
i
got
my
staff
i
go
home
and
get
it
and

sharp
here
and
start
in
a
body

and
the
unicorn
so
as
when
i
raise
en
up
and
hit
my
prisoner

made
a
lawful
blow
thereby
i
would
to
take
up
a
man
without
my
staff
no
not
i
if
i
had
the
law
to

courage
why

taking

might
take
up

i

king

and

authority
enough

said
the
formidable
officer
in
gray
then

be
ready

ye
any
lanterns
have
ye
any
lanterns
i
demand

said
the
constable

the
constable

good
stout
staves
and
and

law

hands
and
go
in
quest
and
do
as
we
in
authority
tell
ye
thus
aroused
the
men
prepared
to
give
chase
the
evidence
was
indeed
though
circumstantial
so
convincing
that
but
little
argument
was
needed
to
show
the
shepherd
guests
that
after
what
they
had
seen
it
would
look
very
much
like
connivance
if
they
did
not
instantly
pursue
the
unhappy
third
stranger
who
could
not
as
yet
have
gone
more
than
a
few
hundred
yards
over
such
uneven
country
a
shepherd
is
always
well
provided
with
lanterns
and
lighting
these
hastily
and
with
in
their
hands
they
poured
out
of
the
door
taking
a
direction
along
the
crest
of
the
hill
away
from
the
town
the
rain
having
fortunately
a
little
abated
disturbed
by
the
noise
or
possibly
by
unpleasant
dreams
of
her
baptism
the
child
who
had
been
christened
began
to
cry
in
the
room
overhead
these
notes
of
grief
came
down
through
the
chinks
of
the
floor
to
the
ears
of
the
women
below
who
jumped
up
one
by
one
and
seemed
glad
of
the
excuse
to
ascend
and
comfort
the
baby
for
the
incidents
of
the
last
greatly
oppressed
them
thus
in
the
space
of
two
or
three
minutes
the
room
on
the
was
deserted
quite
but
it
was
not
for
long
hardly
had
the
sound
of
footsteps
died
away
when
a
man
returned
round
the
corner
of
the
house
from
the
direction
the
pursuers
had
taken
peeping
in
at
the
door
and
seeing
nobody
there
he
entered
leisurely
it
was
the
stranger
of
the
who
had
gone
out
with
the
rest
the
motive
of
his
return
was
shown
by
his
helping
himself
to
a
cut
piece
of
that
lay
on
a
ledge
beside
where
he
had
sat
and
which
he
had
apparently
forgotten
to
take
with
him
he
also
poured
out
half
a
cup
more
mead
from
the
quantity
that
remained
ravenously
eating
and
drinking
these
as
he
stood
he
had
not
finished
when
another
figure
came
in
just
as
quietly
his
friend
in
you
here
said
the
latter
smiling
thought
you
had
gone
to
help
in
the
capture
and
this
speaker
also
revealed
the
object
of
his
return
by
looking
solicitously
round
for
the
fascinating
mug
of
old
mead
i
thought
you
had
gone
said
the
other
continuing
his
with
some
effort
on
second
thoughts
i
felt
there
were
enough
without
me
said
the
first
confidentially
such
a
night
as
it
is
too
besides
is
the
business
o
the
government
to
take
care
of
its
criminals
not
mine
so
it
is
and
i
felt
as
you
did
that
there
were
enough
without
me
do
want
to
break
my
limbs
running
over
the
humps
and
hollows
of
this
wild
country
i
neither
between
you
and
me
are
used
to
it
souls
you
know
stirred
up
to
anything
in
a
moment
they
have
him
ready
for
me
before
the
morning
and
no
trouble
to
me
at
all
have
him
and
we
shall
have
saved
ourselves
all
labour
in
the
matter
true
well
my
way
is
to
casterbridge
and
is
as
much
as
my
legs
will
do
to
take
me
that
far
going
the
same
way
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
have
to
get
home
over
there
he
nodded
indefinitely
to
the
right
i
feel
as
you
do
that
it
is
quite
enough
for
my
legs
to
do
before
bedtime
the
other
had
by
this
time
finished
the
mead
in
the
mug
after
which
shaking
hands
heartily
at
the
door
and
wishing
each
other
well
they
went
their
several
ways
in
the
meantime
the
company
of
pursuers
had
reached
the
end
of
the
back
elevation
which
dominated
this
part
of
the
down
they
had
decided
on
no
particular
plan
of
action
and
finding
that
the
man
of
the
baleful
trade
was
no
longer
in
their
company
they
seemed
quite
unable
to
form
any
such
plan
now
they
descended
in
all
directions
down
the
hill
and
straightway
several
of
the
party
fell
into
the
snare
set
by
nature
for
all
misguided
midnight
ramblers
over
this
part
of
the
cretaceous
formation
the
or
flint
slopes
which
belted
the
escarpment
at
intervals
of
a
dozen
yards
took
the
less
cautious
ones
unawares
and
losing
their
footing
on
the
rubbly
steep
they
slid
sharply
downwards
the
lanterns
rolling
from
their
hands
to
the
bottom
and
there
lying
on
their
sides
till
the
horn
was
scorched
through
when
they
had
again
gathered
themselves
together
the
shepherd
as
the
man
who
knew
the
country
best
took
the
lead
and
guided
them
round
these
treacherous
inclines
the
lanterns
which
seemed
rather
to
dazzle
their
eyes
and
warn
the
fugitive
than
to
assist
them
in
the
exploration
were
extinguished
due
silence
was
observed
and
in
this
more
rational
order
they
plunged
into
the
vale
it
was
a
grassy
briery
moist
defile
affording
some
shelter
to
any
person
who
had
sought
it
but
the
party
perambulated
it
in
vain
and
ascended
on
the
other
side
here
they
wandered
apart
and
after
an
interval
closed
together
again
to
report
progress
at
the
second
time
of
closing
in
they
found
themselves
near
a
lonely
ash
the
single
tree
on
this
part
of
the
coomb
probably
sown
there
by
a
passing
bird
some
fifty
years
before
and
here
standing
a
little
to
one
side
of
the
trunk
as
motionless
as
the
trunk
itself
appeared
the
man
they
were
in
quest
of
his
outline
being
well
defined
against
the
sky
beyond
the
band
noiselessly
drew
up
and
faced
him

your

said
the
constable
sternly
to
the
still
figure

our
side
ought
to
say
that
that
the
doctrine
of
vagabonds
like
him
and
we
be
on
the
side
of
the
law
well
replied
the
constable
impatiently
must
say
something
must
i
and
if
you
had
all
the
weight
o
this
undertaking
upon
your
mind
perhaps
you

the

too
prisoner

surrender
in
the

of
the

the

the
man
under
the
tree
seemed
now
to
notice
them
for
the
first
time
and
giving
them
no
opportunity
whatever
for
exhibiting
their
courage
he
strolled
slowly
towards
them
he
was
indeed
the
little
man
the
third
stranger
but
his
trepidation
had
in
a
great
measure
gone
travellers
he
said
i
hear
ye
speak
to
me
did
you
got
to
come
and
be
our
prisoner
at
once
said
the
constable
arrest
on
the
charge
of
not
biding
in
casterbridge
jail
in
a
decent
proper
manner
to
be
hung
morning
neighbours
do
your
duty
and
seize
the
culpet
on
hearing
the
charge
the
man
seemed
enlightened
and
saying
not
another
word
resigned
himself
with
preternatural
civility
to
the
party
who
with
their
staves
in
their
hands
surrounded
him
on
all
sides
and
marched
him
back
towards
the
shepherd
cottage
it
was
eleven
by
the
time
they
arrived
the
light
shining
from
the
open
door
a
sound
of
men
voices
within
proclaimed
to
them
as
they
approached
the
house
that
some
new
events
had
arisen
in
their
absence
on
entering
they
discovered
the
shepherd
living
room
to
be
invaded
by
two
officers
from
casterbridge
jail
and
a
magistrate
who
lived
at
the
nearest
intelligence
of
the
escape
having
become
generally
circulated
said
the
constable
have
brought
back
your
man
not
without
risk
and
danger
but
every
one
must
do
his
duty
he
is
inside
this
circle
of
persons
who
have
lent
me
useful
aid
considering
their
ignorance
of
crown
work
men
bring
forward
your
prisoner
and
the
third
stranger
was
led
to
the
light
is
this
said
one
of
the
officials
man
said
the
constable
not
said
the
turnkey
and
the
first
corroborated
his
statement
how
can
it
be
otherwise
asked
the
constable
why
was
he
so
terrified
at
sight
o
the
singing
instrument
of
the
law
who
sat
there
here
he
related
the
strange
behaviour
of
the
third
stranger
on
entering
the
house
during
the
hangman
song
understand
it
said
the
officer
coolly
i
know
is
that
it
is
not
the
condemned
man
he
quite
a
different
character
from
this
one
a
gauntish
fellow
with
dark
hair
and
eyes
rather
and
with
a
musical
bass
voice
that
if
you
heard
it
once
you
never
mistake
as
long
as
you
lived
souls
was
the
man
in
the
what
said
the
magistrate
coming
forward
after
inquiring
particulars
from
the
shepherd
in
the
background
you
got
the
man
after
all
sir
said
the
constable
the
man
we
were
in
search
of
that
true
and
yet
he
not
the
man
we
were
in
search
of
for
the
man
we
were
in
search
of
was
not
the
man
we
wanted
sir
if
you
understand
my
everyday
way
for
was
the
man
in
the
pretty
kettle
of
fish
altogether
said
the
magistrate
had
better
start
for
the
other
man
at
once
the
prisoner
now
spoke
for
the
first
time
the
mention
of
the
man
in
the
seemed
to
have
moved
him
as
nothing
else
could
do
he
said
stepping
forward
to
the
magistrate
no
more
trouble
about
me
the
time
is
come
when
i
may
as
well
speak
i
have
done
nothing
my
crime
is
that
the
condemned
man
is
my
brother
early
this
afternoon
i
left
home
at
shottsford
to
tramp
it
all
the
way
to
casterbridge
jail
to
bid
him
farewell
i
was
benighted
and
called
here
to
rest
and
ask
the
way
when
i
opened
the
door
i
saw
before
me
the
very
man
my
brother
that
i
thought
to
see
in
the
condemned
cell
at
casterbridge
he
was
in
this
and
jammed
close
to
him
so
that
he
could
not
have
got
out
if
he
had
tried
was
the
executioner
who
come
to
take
his
life
singing
a
song
about
it
and
not
knowing
that
it
was
his
victim
who
was
close
by
joining
in
to
save
appearances
my
brother
looked
a
glance
of
agony
at
me
and
i
knew
he
meant
do
reveal
what
you
see
my
life
depends
on
it
i
was
so
that
i
could
hardly
stand
and
not
knowing
what
i
did
i
turned
and
hurried
away
the
narrator
manner
and
tone
had
the
stamp
of
truth
and
his
story
made
a
great
impression
on
all
around
do
you
know
where
your
brother
is
at
the
present
time
asked
the
magistrate
do
not
i
have
never
seen
him
since
i
closed
this
door
can
testify
to
that
for
we
been
between
ye
ever
since
said
the
constable
does
he
think
to
fly
to
what
is
his
occupation
a
sir
said
was
a
wheelwright
a
wicked
rogue
said
the
constable
wheels
of
clocks
and
watches
he
meant
no
doubt
said
shepherd
fennel
thought
his
hands
were
palish
for
trade
it
appears
to
me
that
nothing
can
be
gained
by
retaining
this
poor
man
in
custody
said
the
magistrate
business
lies
with
the
other
unquestionably
and
so
the
little
man
was
released
but
he
looked
nothing
the
less
sad
on
that
account
it
being
beyond
the
power
of
magistrate
or
constable
to
raze
out
the
written
troubles
in
his
brain
for
they
concerned
another
whom
he
regarded
with
more
solicitude
than
himself
when
this
was
done
and
the
man
had
gone
his
way
the
night
was
found
to
be
so
far
advanced
that
it
was
deemed
useless
to
renew
the
search
before
the
next
morning
next
day
accordingly
the
quest
for
the
clever
became
general
and
keen
to
all
appearance
at
least
but
the
intended
punishment
was
cruelly
disproportioned
to
the
transgression
and
the
sympathy
of
a
great
many
in
that
district
was
strongly
on
the
side
of
the
fugitive
moreover
his
marvellous
coolness
and
daring
in
with
the
hangman
under
the
unprecedented
circumstances
of
the
shepherd
party
won
their
admiration
so
that
it
may
be
questioned
if
all
those
who
ostensibly
made
themselves
so
busy
in
exploring
woods
and
fields
and
lanes
were
quite
so
thorough
when
it
came
to
the
private
examination
of
their
own
lofts
and
outhouses
stories
were
afloat
of
a
mysterious
figure
being
occasionally
seen
in
some
old
overgrown
trackway
or
other
remote
from
turnpike
roads
but
when
a
search
was
instituted
in
any
of
these
suspected
quarters
nobody
was
found
thus
the
days
and
weeks
passed
without
tidings
in
brief
the
man
of
the
was
never
recaptured
some
said
that
he
went
across
the
sea
others
that
he
did
not
but
buried
himself
in
the
depths
of
a
populous
city
at
any
rate
the
gentleman
in
never
did
his
morning
work
at
casterbridge
nor
met
anywhere
at
all
for
business
purposes
the
genial
comrade
with
whom
he
had
passed
an
hour
of
relaxation
in
the
lonely
house
on
the
coomb
the
grass
has
long
been
green
on
the
graves
of
shepherd
fennel
and
his
frugal
wife
the
guests
who
made
up
the
christening
party
have
mainly
followed
their
entertainers
to
the
tomb
the
baby
in
whose
honour
they
all
had
met
is
a
matron
in
the
sere
and
yellow
leaf
but
the
arrival
of
the
three
strangers
at
the
shepherd
that
night
and
the
details
connected
therewith
is
a
story
as
well
known
as
ever
in
the
country
about
higher
crowstairs
march
the
withered
arm
chapter
i
a
lorn
milkmaid
it
was
an
dairy
and
the
troop
of
milkers
regular
and
supernumerary
were
all
at
work
for
though
the
time
of
year
was
as
yet
but
early
april
the
feed
lay
entirely
in
and
the
cows
were
full
pail
the
hour
was
about
six
in
the
evening
and
fourths
of
the
large
red
rectangular
animals
having
been
finished
off
there
was
opportunity
for
a
little
conversation
do
bring
home
his
bride
i
hear
they
come
as
far
as
anglebury
the
voice
seemed
to
proceed
from
the
belly
of
the
cow
called
cherry
but
the
speaker
was
a
whose
face
was
buried
in
the
flank
of
that
motionless
beast
anybody
seen
her
said
another
there
was
a
negative
response
from
the
first
they
say
she
a
little
body
enough
she
added
and
as
the
milkmaid
spoke
she
turned
her
face
so
that
she
could
glance
past
her
cow
tail
to
the
other
side
of
the
barton
where
a
thin
fading
woman
of
thirty
milked
somewhat
apart
from
the
rest
younger
than
he
they
say
continued
the
second
with
also
a
glance
of
reflectiveness
in
the
same
direction
old
do
you
call
him
then
or
so
like
forty
broke
in
an
old
milkman
near
in
a
long
white
pinafore
or
and
with
the
brim
of
his
hat
tied
down
so
that
he
looked
like
a
woman
was
born
before
our
great
weir
was
builded
and
i
had
man
wages
when
i
laved
water
there
the
discussion
waxed
so
warm
that
the
purr
of
the
became
jerky
till
a
voice
from
another
cow
belly
cried
with
authority
then
what
the
turk
do
it
matter
to
us
about
farmer
lodge
age
or
farmer
lodge
new
i
shall
have
to
pay
him
nine
pound
a
year
for
the
rent
of
every
one
of
these
milchers
whatever
his
age
or
hers
get
on
with
your
work
or
be
dark
afore
we
have
done
the
evening
is
pinking
in
this
speaker
was
the
dairyman
himself
by
whom
the
milkmaids
and
men
were
employed
nothing
more
was
said
publicly
about
farmer
lodge
wedding
but
the
first
woman
murmured
under
her
cow
to
her
next
neighbour
hard
for
she
signifying
the
thin
worn
milkmaid
aforesaid
no
said
the
second
spoke
to
rhoda
brook
for
years
when
the
milking
was
done
they
washed
their
pails
and
hung
them
on
a
forked
stand
made
of
the
peeled
limb
of
an
set
upright
in
the
earth
and
resembling
a
colossal
antlered
horn
the
majority
then
dispersed
in
various
directions
homeward
the
thin
woman
who
had
not
spoken
was
joined
by
a
boy
of
twelve
or
thereabout
and
the
twain
went
away
up
the
field
also
their
course
lay
apart
from
that
of
the
others
to
a
lonely
spot
high
above
the
and
not
far
from
the
border
of
egdon
heath
whose
dark
countenance
was
visible
in
the
distance
as
they
drew
nigh
to
their
home
just
been
saying
down
in
barton
that
your
father
brings
his
young
wife
home
from
anglebury
the
woman
observed
shall
want
to
send
you
for
a
few
things
to
market
and
you
be
pretty
sure
to
meet
mother
said
the
boy
father
married
then
you
can
give
her
a
look
and
tell
me
what
she
like
if
you
do
see
her
mother
she
dark
or
fair
and
if
she
tall
as
tall
as
i
and
if
she
seems
like
a
woman
who
has
ever
worked
for
a
living
or
one
that
has
been
always
well
off
and
has
never
done
anything
and
shows
marks
of
the
lady
on
her
as
i
expect
she
do
they
crept
up
the
hill
in
the
twilight
and
entered
the
cottage
it
was
built
of
the
surface
of
which
had
been
washed
by
many
rains
into
channels
and
depressions
that
left
none
of
the
original
flat
face
visible
while
here
and
there
in
the
thatch
above
a
rafter
showed
like
a
bone
protruding
through
the
skin
she
was
kneeling
down
in
the
before
two
pieces
of
turf
laid
together
with
the
heather
inwards
blowing
at
the
ashes
with
her
breath
till
the
turves
flamed
the
radiance
lit
her
pale
cheek
and
made
her
dark
eyes
that
had
once
been
handsome
seem
handsome
anew
she
resumed
if
she
is
dark
or
fair
and
if
you
can
notice
if
her
hands
be
white
if
not
see
if
they
look
as
though
she
had
ever
done
housework
or
are
milker
hands
like
mine
the
boy
again
promised
inattentively
this
time
his
mother
not
observing
that
he
was
cutting
a
notch
with
his
in
the
chair
chapter
ii
the
young
wife
the
road
from
anglebury
to
holmstoke
is
in
general
level
but
there
is
one
place
where
a
sharp
ascent
breaks
its
monotony
farmers
bound
from
the
former
who
trot
all
the
rest
of
the
way
walk
their
horses
up
this
short
incline
the
next
evening
while
the
sun
was
yet
bright
a
handsome
new
gig
with
a
body
and
red
wheels
was
spinning
westward
along
the
level
highway
at
the
heels
of
a
powerful
mare
the
driver
was
a
yeoman
in
the
prime
of
life
cleanly
shaven
like
an
actor
his
face
being
toned
to
that
hue
which
so
often
graces
a
thriving
features
when
returning
home
after
successful
dealings
in
the
town
beside
him
sat
a
woman
many
years
his
junior
almost
indeed
a
girl
her
face
too
was
fresh
in
colour
but
it
was
of
a
totally
different
quality
soft
and
evanescent
like
the
light
under
a
heap
of
few
people
travelled
this
way
for
it
was
not
a
main
road
and
the
long
white
riband
of
gravel
that
stretched
before
them
was
empty
save
of
one
small
speck
which
presently
resolved
itself
into
the
figure
of
boy
who
was
creeping
on
at
a
snail
pace
and
continually
looking
behind
him
the
heavy
bundle
he
carried
being
some
excuse
for
if
not
the
reason
of
his
dilatoriness
when
the
bouncing
slowed
at
the
bottom
of
the
incline
above
mentioned
the
pedestrian
was
only
a
few
yards
in
front
supporting
the
large
bundle
by
putting
one
hand
on
his
hip
he
turned
and
looked
straight
at
the
farmer
wife
as
though
he
would
read
her
through
and
through
pacing
along
abreast
of
the
horse
the
low
sun
was
full
in
her
face
rendering
every
feature
shade
and
contour
distinct
from
the
curve
of
her
little
nostril
to
the
colour
of
her
eyes
the
farmer
though
he
seemed
annoyed
at
the
boy
persistent
presence
did
not
order
him
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
thus
the
lad
preceded
them
his
hard
gaze
never
leaving
her
till
they
reached
the
top
of
the
ascent
when
the
farmer
trotted
on
with
relief
in
his
lineaments
having
taken
no
outward
notice
of
the
boy
whatever
that
poor
lad
stared
at
me
said
the
young
wife
dear
i
saw
that
he
did
is
one
of
the
village
i
suppose
of
the
neighbourhood
i
think
he
lives
with
his
mother
a
mile
or
two
off
knows
who
we
are
no
doubt
yes
you
must
expect
to
be
stared
at
just
at
first
my
pretty
gertrude
do
though
i
think
the
poor
boy
may
have
looked
at
us
in
the
hope
we
might
relieve
him
of
his
heavy
load
rather
than
from
curiosity
no
said
her
husband
country
lads
will
carry
a
hundredweight
once
they
get
it
on
their
backs
besides
his
pack
had
more
size
than
weight
in
it
now
then
another
mile
and
i
shall
be
able
to
show
you
our
house
in
the
distance
if
it
is
not
too
dark
before
we
get
there
the
wheels
spun
round
and
particles
flew
from
their
periphery
as
before
till
a
white
house
of
ample
dimensions
revealed
itself
with
and
ricks
at
the
back
meanwhile
the
boy
had
quickened
his
pace
and
turning
up
a
some
mile
and
half
short
of
the
white
farmstead
ascended
towards
the
leaner
pastures
and
so
on
to
the
cottage
of
his
mother
she
had
reached
home
after
her
day
milking
at
the
outlying
dairy
and
was
washing
cabbage
at
the
doorway
in
the
declining
light
up
the
net
a
moment
she
said
without
preface
as
the
boy
came
up
he
flung
down
his
bundle
held
the
edge
of
the
and
as
she
filled
its
meshes
with
the
dripping
leaves
she
went
on
did
you
see
her
quite
plain
she
ladylike
and
more
a
lady
complete
she
young
she
growed
up
and
her
ways
be
quite
a
woman
course
what
colour
is
her
hair
and
face
hair
is
lightish
and
her
face
as
comely
as
a
live
doll
eyes
then
are
not
dark
like
mine
of
a
bluish
turn
and
her
mouth
is
very
nice
and
red
and
when
she
smiles
her
teeth
show
white
she
tall
said
the
woman
sharply
could
see
she
was
sitting
down
do
you
go
to
holmstoke
church
morning
she
sure
to
be
there
go
early
and
notice
her
walking
in
and
come
home
and
tell
me
if
she
taller
than
i
well
mother
but
why
do
you
go
and
see
for
yourself
go
to
see
her
i
would
look
up
at
her
if
she
were
to
pass
my
window
this
instant
she
was
with
lodge
of
course
what
did
he
say
or
do
the
same
as
usual
no
notice
of
you
next
day
the
mother
put
a
clean
shirt
on
the
boy
and
started
him
off
for
holmstoke
church
he
reached
the
ancient
little
pile
when
the
door
was
just
being
opened
and
he
was
the
first
to
enter
taking
his
seat
by
the
font
he
watched
all
the
parishioners
file
in
the
farmer
lodge
came
nearly
last
and
his
young
wife
who
accompanied
him
walked
up
the
aisle
with
the
shyness
natural
to
a
modest
woman
who
had
appeared
thus
for
the
first
time
as
all
other
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
the
youth
stare
was
not
noticed
now
when
he
reached
home
his
mother
said
before
he
had
entered
the
room
is
not
tall
she
is
rather
short
he
replied
said
his
mother
with
satisfaction
she
very
pretty
very
in
fact
she
lovely
the
youthful
freshness
of
the
yeoman
wife
had
evidently
made
an
impression
even
on
the
somewhat
hard
nature
of
the
boy
all
i
want
to
hear
said
his
mother
quickly
spread
the
the
hare
you
caught
is
very
tender
but
mind
that
nobody
catches
you
never
told
me
what
sort
of
hands
she
had
have
never
seen
she
never
took
off
her
gloves
did
she
wear
this
morning
white
bonnet
and
a
gownd
it
whewed
and
whistled
so
loud
when
it
rubbed
against
the
pews
that
the
lady
coloured
up
more
than
ever
for
very
shame
at
the
noise
and
pulled
it
in
to
keep
it
from
touching
but
when
she
pushed
into
her
seat
it
whewed
more
than
ever
lodge
he
seemed
pleased
and
his
waistcoat
stuck
out
and
his
great
golden
seals
hung
like
a
lord
but
she
seemed
to
wish
her
noisy
gownd
anywhere
but
on
her
she
however
that
will
do
now
these
descriptions
of
the
couple
were
continued
from
time
to
time
by
the
boy
at
his
mother
request
after
any
chance
encounter
he
had
had
with
them
but
rhoda
brook
though
she
might
easily
have
seen
young
lodge
for
herself
by
walking
a
couple
of
miles
would
never
attempt
an
excursion
towards
the
quarter
where
the
farmhouse
lay
neither
did
she
at
the
daily
milking
in
the
dairyman
yard
on
lodge
outlying
second
farm
ever
speak
on
the
subject
of
the
recent
marriage
the
dairyman
who
rented
the
cows
of
lodge
and
knew
perfectly
the
tall
milkmaid
history
with
manly
kindliness
always
kept
the
gossip
in
the
from
annoying
rhoda
but
the
atmosphere
thereabout
was
full
of
the
subject
during
the
first
days
of
lodge
arrival
and
from
her
boy
description
and
the
casual
words
of
the
other
milkers
rhoda
brook
could
raise
a
mental
image
of
the
unconscious
mrs
lodge
that
was
realistic
as
a
photograph
chapter
iii
a
vision
one
night
two
or
three
weeks
after
the
bridal
return
when
the
boy
was
gone
to
bed
rhoda
sat
a
long
time
over
the
turf
ashes
that
she
had
raked
out
in
front
of
her
to
extinguish
them
she
contemplated
so
intently
the
new
wife
as
presented
to
her
in
her
mind
eye
over
the
embers
that
she
forgot
the
lapse
of
time
at
last
wearied
with
her
day
work
she
too
retired
but
the
figure
which
had
occupied
her
so
much
during
this
and
the
previous
days
was
not
to
be
banished
at
night
for
the
first
time
gertrude
lodge
visited
the
supplanted
woman
in
her
dreams
rhoda
brook
dreamed
since
her
assertion
that
she
really
saw
before
falling
asleep
was
not
to
be
believed
that
the
young
wife
in
the
pale
silk
dress
and
white
bonnet
but
with
features
shockingly
distorted
and
wrinkled
as
by
age
was
sitting
upon
her
chest
as
she
lay
the
pressure
of
person
grew
heavier
the
blue
eyes
peered
cruelly
into
her
face
and
then
the
figure
thrust
forward
its
left
hand
mockingly
so
as
to
make
the
it
wore
glitter
in
rhoda
eyes
maddened
mentally
and
nearly
suffocated
by
pressure
the
sleeper
struggled
the
incubus
still
regarding
her
withdrew
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
only
however
to
come
forward
by
degrees
resume
her
seat
and
flash
her
left
hand
as
before
gasping
for
breath
rhoda
in
a
last
desperate
effort
swung
out
her
right
hand
seized
the
confronting
spectre
by
its
obtrusive
left
arm
and
whirled
it
backward
to
the
floor
starting
up
herself
as
she
did
so
with
a
low
cry
merciful
heaven
she
cried
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
in
a
cold
sweat
was
not
a
dream
she
was
here
she
could
feel
her
antagonist
arm
within
her
grasp
even
now
the
very
flesh
and
bone
of
it
as
it
seemed
she
looked
on
the
floor
whither
she
had
whirled
the
spectre
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
rhoda
brook
slept
no
more
that
night
and
when
she
went
milking
at
the
next
dawn
they
noticed
how
pale
and
haggard
she
looked
the
milk
that
she
drew
quivered
into
the
pail
her
hand
had
not
calmed
even
yet
and
still
retained
the
feel
of
the
arm
she
came
home
to
breakfast
as
wearily
as
if
it
had
been
suppertime
was
that
noise
in
your
chimmer
mother
last
night
said
her
son
fell
off
the
bed
surely
you
hear
anything
fall
at
what
time
when
the
clock
struck
two
she
could
not
explain
and
when
the
meal
was
done
went
silently
about
her
household
work
the
boy
assisting
her
for
he
hated
going
afield
on
the
farms
and
she
indulged
his
reluctance
between
eleven
and
twelve
the
clicked
and
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
the
window
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
within
the
gate
stood
the
woman
of
her
vision
rhoda
seemed
transfixed
she
said
she
would
come
exclaimed
the
boy
also
observing
her
so
when
how
does
she
know
us
have
seen
and
spoken
to
her
i
talked
to
her
yesterday
told
you
said
the
mother
flushing
indignantly
to
speak
to
anybody
in
that
house
or
go
near
the
place
did
not
speak
to
her
till
she
spoke
to
me
and
i
did
not
go
near
the
place
i
met
her
in
the
road
did
you
tell
her
she
said
are
you
the
poor
boy
who
had
to
bring
the
heavy
load
from
market
and
she
looked
at
my
boots
and
said
they
would
not
keep
my
feet
dry
if
it
came
on
wet
because
they
were
so
cracked
i
told
her
i
lived
with
my
mother
and
we
had
enough
to
do
to
keep
ourselves
and
that
how
it
was
and
she
said
then
i
come
and
bring
you
some
better
boots
and
see
your
mother
she
gives
away
things
to
other
folks
in
the
meads
besides
us
lodge
was
by
this
time
close
to
the
door
not
in
her
silk
as
rhoda
had
seen
her
in
the
but
in
a
morning
hat
and
gown
of
common
light
material
which
became
her
better
than
silk
on
her
arm
she
carried
a
basket
the
impression
remaining
from
the
night
experience
was
still
strong
brook
had
almost
expected
to
see
the
wrinkles
the
scorn
and
the
cruelty
on
her
visitor
face
she
would
have
escaped
an
interview
had
escape
been
possible
there
was
however
no
backdoor
to
the
cottage
and
in
an
instant
the
boy
had
lifted
the
latch
to
lodge
gentle
knock
see
i
have
come
to
the
right
house
said
she
glancing
at
the
lad
and
smiling
i
was
not
sure
till
you
opened
the
door
the
figure
and
action
were
those
of
the
phantom
but
her
voice
was
so
indescribably
sweet
her
glance
so
winning
her
smile
so
tender
so
unlike
that
of
rhoda
midnight
visitant
that
the
latter
could
hardly
believe
the
evidence
of
her
senses
she
was
truly
glad
that
she
had
not
hidden
away
in
sheer
aversion
as
she
had
been
inclined
to
do
in
her
basket
lodge
brought
the
pair
of
boots
that
she
had
promised
to
the
boy
and
other
useful
articles
at
these
proofs
of
a
kindly
feeling
towards
her
and
hers
rhoda
heart
reproached
her
bitterly
this
innocent
young
thing
should
have
her
blessing
and
not
her
curse
when
she
left
them
a
light
seemed
gone
from
the
dwelling
two
days
later
she
came
again
to
know
if
the
boots
fitted
and
less
than
a
fortnight
after
that
paid
rhoda
another
call
on
this
occasion
the
boy
was
absent
walk
a
good
deal
said
lodge
your
house
is
the
nearest
outside
our
own
parish
i
hope
you
are
well
you
do
look
quite
well
rhoda
said
she
was
well
enough
and
indeed
though
the
paler
of
the
two
there
was
more
of
the
strength
that
endures
in
her
features
and
large
frame
than
in
the
young
woman
before
her
the
conversation
became
quite
confidential
as
regarded
their
powers
and
weaknesses
and
when
lodge
was
leaving
rhoda
said
hope
you
will
find
this
air
agree
with
you
and
not
suffer
from
the
damp
of
the
the
younger
one
replied
that
there
was
not
much
doubt
of
it
her
general
health
being
usually
good
now
you
remind
me
she
added
have
one
little
ailment
which
puzzles
me
it
is
nothing
serious
but
i
can
not
make
it
out
she
uncovered
her
left
hand
and
arm
and
their
outline
confronted
gaze
as
the
exact
original
of
the
limb
she
had
beheld
and
seized
in
her
dream
upon
the
pink
round
surface
of
the
arm
were
faint
marks
of
an
unhealthy
colour
as
if
produced
by
a
rough
grasp
rhoda
eyes
became
riveted
on
the
discolorations
she
fancied
that
she
discerned
in
them
the
shape
of
her
own
four
fingers
did
it
happen
she
said
mechanically
can
not
tell
replied
lodge
shaking
her
head
night
when
i
was
sound
asleep
dreaming
i
was
away
in
some
strange
place
a
pain
suddenly
shot
into
my
arm
there
and
was
so
keen
as
to
awaken
me
i
must
have
struck
it
in
the
daytime
i
suppose
though
i
do
remember
doing
so
she
added
laughing
tell
my
dear
husband
that
it
looks
just
as
if
he
had
flown
into
a
rage
and
struck
me
there
o
i
daresay
it
will
soon
disappear
ha
yes
on
what
night
did
it
come
lodge
considered
and
said
it
would
be
a
fortnight
ago
on
the
morrow
i
awoke
i
could
not
remember
where
i
was
she
added
the
clock
striking
two
reminded
me
she
had
named
the
night
and
the
hour
of
rhoda
spectral
encounter
and
brook
felt
like
a
guilty
thing
the
artless
disclosure
startled
her
she
did
not
reason
on
the
freaks
of
coincidence
and
all
the
scenery
of
that
ghastly
night
returned
with
double
vividness
to
her
mind
can
it
be
she
said
to
herself
when
her
visitor
had
departed
i
exercise
a
malignant
power
over
people
against
my
own
will
she
knew
that
she
had
been
slily
called
a
witch
since
her
fall
but
never
having
understood
why
that
particular
stigma
had
been
attached
to
her
it
had
passed
disregarded
could
this
be
the
explanation
and
had
such
things
as
this
ever
happened
before
chapter
iv
a
suggestion
the
summer
drew
on
and
rhoda
brook
almost
dreaded
to
meet
lodge
again
notwithstanding
that
her
feeling
for
the
young
wife
amounted
nigh
to
affection
something
in
her
own
individuality
seemed
to
convict
rhoda
of
crime
yet
a
fatality
sometimes
would
direct
the
steps
of
the
latter
to
the
outskirts
of
holmstoke
whenever
she
left
her
house
for
any
other
purpose
than
her
daily
work
and
hence
it
happened
that
their
next
encounter
was
out
of
doors
rhoda
could
not
avoid
the
subject
which
had
so
mystified
her
and
after
the
first
few
words
she
stammered
hope
your
arm
is
well
again
she
had
perceived
with
consternation
that
gertrude
lodge
carried
her
left
arm
stiffly
it
is
not
quite
well
indeed
it
is
no
better
at
all
it
is
rather
worse
it
pains
me
dreadfully
sometimes
you
had
better
go
to
a
doctor
she
replied
that
she
had
already
seen
a
doctor
her
husband
had
insisted
upon
her
going
to
one
but
the
surgeon
had
not
seemed
to
understand
the
afflicted
limb
at
all
he
had
told
her
to
bathe
it
in
hot
water
and
she
had
bathed
it
but
the
treatment
had
done
no
good
you
let
me
see
it
said
the
milkwoman
lodge
pushed
up
her
sleeve
and
disclosed
the
place
which
was
a
few
inches
above
the
wrist
as
soon
as
rhoda
brook
saw
it
she
could
hardly
preserve
her
composure
there
was
nothing
of
the
nature
of
a
wound
but
the
arm
at
that
point
had
a
shrivelled
look
and
the
outline
of
the
four
fingers
appeared
more
distinct
than
at
the
former
time
moreover
she
fancied
that
they
were
imprinted
in
precisely
the
relative
position
of
her
clutch
upon
the
arm
in
the
trance
the
first
finger
towards
gertrude
wrist
and
the
fourth
towards
her
elbow
what
the
impress
resembled
seemed
to
have
struck
gertrude
herself
since
their
last
meeting
looks
almost
like
she
said
adding
with
a
faint
laugh
husband
says
it
is
as
if
some
witch
or
the
devil
himself
had
taken
hold
of
me
there
and
blasted
the
flesh
rhoda
shivered
fancy
she
said
hurriedly
would
mind
it
if
i
were
you
should
so
much
mind
it
said
the
younger
with
hesitation
if
i
had
a
notion
that
it
makes
my
husband
dislike
me
no
love
me
less
men
think
so
much
of
personal
appearance
do
he
for
one
and
he
was
very
proud
of
mine
at
first
your
arm
covered
from
his
sight
he
knows
the
disfigurement
is
there
she
tried
to
hide
the
tears
that
filled
her
eyes
i
earnestly
hope
it
will
go
away
soon
and
so
the
milkwoman
mind
was
chained
anew
to
the
subject
by
a
horrid
sort
of
spell
as
she
returned
home
the
sense
of
having
been
guilty
of
an
act
of
malignity
increased
affect
as
she
might
to
ridicule
her
superstition
in
her
secret
heart
rhoda
did
not
altogether
object
to
a
slight
diminution
of
her
successor
beauty
by
whatever
means
it
had
come
about
but
she
did
not
wish
to
inflict
upon
her
physical
pain
for
though
this
pretty
young
woman
had
rendered
impossible
any
reparation
which
lodge
might
have
made
rhoda
for
his
past
conduct
everything
like
resentment
at
the
unconscious
usurpation
had
quite
passed
away
from
the
elder
mind
if
the
sweet
and
kindly
gertrude
lodge
only
knew
of
the
scene
in
the
chamber
what
would
she
think
not
to
inform
her
of
it
seemed
treachery
in
the
presence
of
her
friendliness
but
tell
she
could
not
of
her
own
accord
neither
could
she
devise
a
remedy
she
mused
upon
the
matter
the
greater
part
of
the
night
and
the
next
day
after
the
morning
milking
set
out
to
obtain
another
glimpse
of
gertrude
lodge
if
she
could
being
held
to
her
by
a
gruesome
fascination
by
watching
the
house
from
a
distance
the
milkmaid
was
presently
able
to
discern
the
farmer
wife
in
a
ride
she
was
taking
alone
probably
to
join
her
husband
in
some
distant
field
lodge
perceived
her
and
cantered
in
her
direction
morning
rhoda
gertrude
said
when
she
had
come
up
was
going
to
call
rhoda
noticed
that
lodge
held
the
reins
with
some
difficulty
hope
the
bad
arm
said
rhoda
tell
me
there
is
possibly
one
way
by
which
i
might
be
able
to
find
out
the
cause
and
so
perhaps
the
cure
of
it
replied
the
other
anxiously
is
by
going
to
some
clever
man
over
in
egdon
heath
they
did
not
know
if
he
was
still
alive
and
i
can
not
remember
his
name
at
this
moment
but
they
said
that
you
knew
more
of
his
movements
than
anybody
else
hereabout
and
could
tell
me
if
he
were
still
to
be
consulted
dear
me
what
was
his
name
but
you
know
conjuror
trendle
said
her
thin
companion
turning
pale
yes
is
he
alive
believe
so
said
rhoda
with
reluctance
do
you
call
him
conjuror
they
say
they
used
to
say
he
was
a
he
had
powers
other
folks
have
not
how
could
my
people
be
so
superstitious
as
to
recommend
a
man
of
that
sort
i
thought
they
meant
some
medical
man
i
shall
think
no
more
of
him
rhoda
looked
relieved
and
lodge
rode
on
the
milkwoman
had
inwardly
seen
from
the
moment
she
heard
of
her
having
been
mentioned
as
a
reference
for
this
man
that
there
must
exist
a
sarcastic
feeling
among
the
that
a
sorceress
would
know
the
whereabouts
of
the
exorcist
they
suspected
her
then
a
short
time
ago
this
would
have
given
no
concern
to
a
woman
of
her
but
she
had
a
haunting
reason
to
be
superstitious
now
and
she
had
been
seized
with
sudden
dread
that
this
conjuror
trendle
might
name
her
as
the
malignant
influence
which
was
blasting
the
fair
person
of
gertrude
and
so
lead
her
friend
to
hate
her
for
ever
and
to
treat
her
as
some
fiend
in
human
shape
but
all
was
not
over
two
days
after
a
shadow
intruded
into
the
pattern
thrown
on
rhoda
brook
floor
by
the
afternoon
sun
the
woman
opened
the
door
at
once
almost
breathlessly
you
alone
said
gertrude
she
seemed
to
be
no
less
harassed
and
anxious
than
brook
herself
said
rhoda
place
on
my
arm
seems
worse
and
troubles
me
the
young
wife
went
on
is
so
mysterious
i
do
hope
it
will
not
be
an
incurable
wound
i
have
again
been
thinking
of
what
they
said
about
conjuror
trendle
i
do
really
believe
in
such
men
but
i
should
not
mind
just
visiting
him
from
curiosity
though
on
no
account
must
my
husband
know
is
it
far
to
where
he
lives
five
miles
said
rhoda
backwardly
the
heart
of
egdon
i
should
have
to
walk
could
not
you
go
with
me
to
show
me
the
way
say
afternoon
not
i
that
is
the
milkwoman
murmured
with
a
start
of
dismay
again
the
dread
seized
her
that
something
to
do
with
her
fierce
act
in
the
dream
might
be
revealed
and
her
character
in
the
eyes
of
the
most
useful
friend
she
had
ever
had
be
ruined
irretrievably
lodge
urged
and
rhoda
finally
assented
though
with
much
misgiving
sad
as
the
journey
would
be
to
her
she
could
not
conscientiously
stand
in
the
way
of
a
possible
remedy
for
her
patron
strange
affliction
it
was
agreed
that
to
escape
suspicion
of
their
mystic
intent
they
should
meet
at
the
edge
of
the
heath
at
the
corner
of
a
plantation
which
was
visible
from
the
spot
where
they
now
stood
chapter
v
conjuror
trendle
by
the
next
afternoon
rhoda
would
have
done
anything
to
escape
this
inquiry
but
she
had
promised
to
go
moreover
there
was
a
horrid
fascination
at
times
in
becoming
instrumental
in
throwing
such
possible
light
on
her
own
character
as
would
reveal
her
to
be
something
greater
in
the
occult
world
than
she
had
ever
herself
suspected
she
started
just
before
the
time
of
day
mentioned
between
them
and
brisk
walking
brought
her
to
the
extension
of
the
egdon
tract
of
country
where
the
fir
plantation
was
a
slight
figure
cloaked
and
veiled
was
already
there
rhoda
recognized
almost
with
a
shudder
that
lodge
bore
her
left
arm
in
a
sling
they
hardly
spoke
to
each
other
and
immediately
set
out
on
their
climb
into
the
interior
of
this
solemn
country
which
stood
high
above
the
rich
alluvial
soil
they
had
left
before
it
was
a
long
walk
thick
clouds
made
the
atmosphere
dark
though
it
was
as
yet
only
early
afternoon
and
the
wind
howled
dismally
over
the
hills
of
the
heath
not
improbably
the
same
heath
which
had
witnessed
the
agony
of
the
wessex
king
ina
presented
to
as
lear
gertrude
lodge
talked
most
rhoda
replying
with
monosyllabic
preoccupation
she
had
a
strange
dislike
to
walking
on
the
side
of
her
companion
where
hung
the
afflicted
arm
moving
round
to
the
other
when
inadvertently
near
it
much
heather
had
been
brushed
by
their
feet
when
they
descended
upon
a
beside
which
stood
the
house
of
the
man
they
sought
he
did
not
profess
his
remedial
practices
openly
or
care
anything
about
their
continuance
his
direct
interests
being
those
of
a
dealer
in
furze
turf
sand
and
other
local
products
indeed
he
affected
not
to
believe
largely
in
his
own
powers
and
when
warts
that
had
been
shown
him
for
cure
miraculously
disappeared
which
it
must
be
owned
they
infallibly
did
he
would
say
lightly
i
only
drink
a
glass
of
grog
upon
perhaps
it
all
chance
and
immediately
turn
the
subject
he
was
at
home
when
they
arrived
having
in
fact
seen
them
descending
into
his
valley
he
was
a
man
with
a
reddish
face
and
he
looked
singularly
at
rhoda
the
first
moment
he
beheld
her
lodge
told
him
her
errand
and
then
with
words
of
he
examined
her
arm
ca
cure
it
he
said
promptly
the
work
of
an
enemy
rhoda
shrank
into
herself
and
drew
back
enemy
what
enemy
asked
lodge
he
shook
his
head
best
known
to
yourself
he
said
you
like
i
can
show
the
person
to
you
though
i
shall
not
myself
know
who
it
is
i
can
do
no
more
and
do
wish
to
do
that
she
pressed
him
on
which
he
told
rhoda
to
wait
outside
where
she
stood
and
took
lodge
into
the
room
it
opened
immediately
from
the
door
and
as
the
latter
remained
ajar
rhoda
brook
could
see
the
proceedings
without
taking
part
in
them
he
brought
a
tumbler
from
the
dresser
nearly
filled
it
with
water
and
fetching
an
egg
prepared
it
in
some
private
way
after
which
he
broke
it
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
so
that
the
white
went
in
and
the
yolk
remained
as
it
was
getting
gloomy
he
took
the
glass
and
its
contents
to
the
window
and
told
gertrude
to
watch
them
closely
they
leant
over
the
table
together
and
the
milkwoman
could
see
the
opaline
hue
of
the
changing
form
as
it
sank
in
the
water
but
she
was
not
near
enough
to
define
the
shape
that
it
assumed
you
catch
the
likeness
of
any
face
or
figure
as
you
look
demanded
the
conjuror
of
the
young
woman
she
murmured
a
reply
in
tones
so
low
as
to
be
inaudible
to
rhoda
and
continued
to
gaze
intently
into
the
glass
rhoda
turned
and
walked
a
few
steps
away
when
lodge
came
out
and
her
face
was
met
by
the
light
it
appeared
exceedingly
pale
as
pale
as
rhoda
against
the
sad
dun
shades
of
the
upland
garniture
trendle
shut
the
door
behind
her
and
they
at
once
started
homeward
together
but
rhoda
perceived
that
her
companion
had
quite
changed
he
charge
much
she
asked
tentatively
no
nothing
he
would
not
take
a
farthing
said
gertrude
what
did
you
see
inquired
rhoda
i
care
to
speak
of
the
constraint
in
her
manner
was
remarkable
her
face
was
so
rigid
as
to
wear
an
oldened
aspect
faintly
suggestive
of
the
face
in
rhoda
it
you
who
first
proposed
coming
here
lodge
suddenly
inquired
after
a
long
pause
very
odd
if
you
did
but
i
am
not
sorry
we
have
come
all
things
considered
she
replied
for
the
first
time
a
sense
of
triumph
possessed
her
and
she
did
not
altogether
deplore
that
the
young
thing
at
her
side
should
learn
that
their
lives
had
been
antagonized
by
other
influences
than
their
own
the
subject
was
no
more
alluded
to
during
the
long
and
dreary
walk
home
but
in
some
way
or
other
a
story
was
whispered
about
the
lowland
that
winter
that
lodge
gradual
loss
of
the
use
of
her
left
arm
was
owing
to
her
being
by
rhoda
brook
the
latter
kept
her
own
counsel
about
the
incubus
but
her
face
grew
sadder
and
thinner
and
in
the
spring
she
and
her
boy
disappeared
from
the
neighbourhood
of
holmstoke
chapter
vi
a
second
attempt
years
passed
away
and
and
lodge
married
experience
sank
into
prosiness
and
worse
the
farmer
was
usually
gloomy
and
silent
the
woman
whom
he
had
wooed
for
her
grace
and
beauty
was
contorted
and
disfigured
in
the
left
limb
moreover
she
had
brought
him
no
child
which
rendered
it
likely
that
he
would
be
the
last
of
a
family
who
had
occupied
that
valley
for
some
two
hundred
years
he
thought
of
rhoda
brook
and
her
son
and
feared
this
might
be
a
judgment
from
heaven
upon
him
the
once
and
enlightened
gertrude
was
changing
into
an
irritable
superstitious
woman
whose
whole
time
was
given
to
experimenting
upon
her
ailment
with
every
quack
remedy
she
came
across
she
was
honestly
attached
to
her
husband
and
was
ever
secretly
hoping
against
hope
to
win
back
his
heart
again
by
regaining
some
at
least
of
her
personal
beauty
hence
it
arose
that
her
closet
was
lined
with
bottles
packets
and
of
every
description
nay
bunches
of
mystic
herbs
charms
and
books
of
necromancy
which
in
her
schoolgirl
time
she
would
have
ridiculed
as
folly
if
you
wo
poison
yourself
with
these
apothecary
messes
and
witch
mixtures
some
time
or
other
said
her
husband
when
his
eye
chanced
to
fall
upon
the
multitudinous
array
she
did
not
reply
but
turned
her
sad
soft
glance
upon
him
in
such
swollen
reproach
that
he
looked
sorry
for
his
words
and
added
only
meant
it
for
your
good
you
know
gertrude
clear
out
the
whole
lot
and
destroy
them
said
she
huskily
try
such
remedies
no
more
want
somebody
to
cheer
you
he
observed
once
thought
of
adopting
a
boy
but
he
is
too
old
now
and
he
is
gone
away
i
do
know
where
she
guessed
to
whom
he
alluded
for
rhoda
brook
story
had
in
the
course
of
years
become
known
to
her
though
not
a
word
had
ever
passed
between
her
husband
and
herself
on
the
subject
neither
had
she
ever
spoken
to
him
of
her
visit
to
conjuror
trendle
and
of
what
was
revealed
to
her
or
she
thought
was
revealed
to
her
by
that
solitary
she
was
now
but
she
seemed
older
years
of
marriage
and
only
a
few
months
of
love
she
sometimes
whispered
to
herself
and
then
she
thought
of
the
apparent
cause
and
said
with
a
tragic
glance
at
her
withering
limb
i
could
only
again
be
as
i
was
when
he
first
saw
me
she
obediently
destroyed
her
nostrums
and
charms
but
there
remained
a
hankering
wish
to
try
something
else
some
other
sort
of
cure
altogether
she
had
never
revisited
trendle
since
she
had
been
conducted
to
the
house
of
the
solitary
by
rhoda
against
her
will
but
it
now
suddenly
occurred
to
gertrude
that
she
would
in
a
last
desperate
effort
at
deliverance
from
this
seeming
curse
again
seek
out
the
man
if
he
yet
lived
he
was
entitled
to
a
certain
credence
for
the
indistinct
form
he
had
raised
in
the
glass
had
undoubtedly
resembled
the
only
woman
in
the
world
who
as
she
now
knew
though
not
then
could
have
a
reason
for
bearing
her
will
the
visit
should
be
paid
this
time
she
went
alone
though
she
nearly
got
lost
on
the
heath
and
roamed
a
considerable
distance
out
of
her
way
trendle
house
was
reached
at
last
however
he
was
not
indoors
and
instead
of
waiting
at
the
cottage
she
went
to
where
his
bent
figure
was
pointed
out
to
her
at
work
a
long
way
off
trendle
remembered
her
and
laying
down
the
handful
of
which
he
was
gathering
and
throwing
into
a
heap
he
offered
to
accompany
her
in
her
homeward
direction
as
the
distance
was
considerable
and
the
days
were
short
so
they
walked
together
his
head
bowed
nearly
to
the
earth
and
his
form
of
a
colour
with
it
can
send
away
warts
and
other
excrescences
i
know
she
said
ca
you
send
away
this
and
the
arm
was
uncovered
think
too
much
of
my
powers
said
trendle
i
am
old
and
weak
now
too
no
no
it
is
too
much
for
me
to
attempt
in
my
own
person
what
have
ye
tried
she
named
to
him
some
of
the
hundred
medicaments
and
counterspells
which
she
had
adopted
from
time
to
time
he
shook
his
head
were
good
enough
he
said
approvingly
not
many
of
them
for
such
as
this
this
is
of
the
nature
of
a
blight
not
of
the
nature
of
a
wound
and
if
you
ever
do
throw
it
off
it
will
be
all
at
once
i
only
could
is
only
one
chance
of
doing
it
known
to
me
it
has
never
failed
in
kindred
afflictions
that
i
can
declare
but
it
is
hard
to
carry
out
and
especially
for
a
woman
me
said
she
must
touch
with
the
limb
the
neck
of
a
man
who
been
hanged
she
started
a
little
at
the
image
he
had
raised
he
cold
just
after
he
cut
down
continued
the
conjuror
impassively
can
that
do
good
will
turn
the
blood
and
change
the
constitution
but
as
i
say
to
do
it
is
hard
you
must
get
into
jail
and
wait
for
him
when
brought
off
the
gallows
lots
have
done
it
though
perhaps
not
such
pretty
women
as
you
i
used
to
send
dozens
for
skin
complaints
but
that
was
in
former
times
the
last
i
sent
was
in
near
twenty
years
ago
he
had
no
more
to
tell
her
and
when
he
had
put
her
into
a
straight
track
homeward
turned
and
left
her
refusing
all
money
as
at
first
chapter
vii
a
ride
the
communication
sank
deep
into
gertrude
mind
her
nature
was
rather
a
timid
one
and
probably
of
all
remedies
that
the
white
wizard
could
have
suggested
there
was
not
one
which
would
have
filled
her
with
so
much
aversion
as
this
not
to
speak
of
the
immense
obstacles
in
the
way
of
its
adoption
casterbridge
the
was
a
dozen
or
fifteen
miles
off
and
though
in
those
days
when
men
were
executed
for
arson
and
burglary
an
assize
seldom
passed
without
a
hanging
it
was
not
likely
that
she
could
get
access
to
the
body
of
the
criminal
unaided
and
the
fear
of
her
husband
anger
made
her
reluctant
to
breathe
a
word
of
trendle
suggestion
to
him
or
to
anybody
about
him
she
did
nothing
for
months
and
patiently
bore
her
disfigurement
as
before
but
her
woman
nature
craving
for
renewed
love
through
the
medium
of
renewed
beauty
she
was
but
was
ever
stimulating
her
to
try
what
at
any
rate
could
hardly
do
her
any
harm
came
by
a
spell
will
go
by
a
spell
surely
she
would
say
whenever
her
imagination
pictured
the
act
she
shrank
in
terror
from
the
possibility
of
it
then
the
words
of
the
conjuror
will
turn
your
blood
were
seen
to
be
capable
of
a
scientific
no
less
than
a
ghastly
interpretation
the
mastering
desire
returned
and
urged
her
on
again
there
was
at
this
time
but
one
county
paper
and
that
her
husband
only
occasionally
borrowed
but
days
had
means
and
news
was
extensively
conveyed
by
word
of
mouth
from
market
to
market
or
from
fair
to
fair
so
that
whenever
such
an
event
as
an
execution
was
about
to
take
place
few
within
a
radius
of
twenty
miles
were
ignorant
of
the
coming
sight
and
so
far
as
holmstoke
was
concerned
some
enthusiasts
had
been
known
to
walk
all
the
way
to
casterbridge
and
back
in
one
day
solely
to
witness
the
spectacle
the
next
assizes
were
in
march
and
when
gertrude
lodge
heard
that
they
had
been
held
she
inquired
stealthily
at
the
inn
as
to
the
result
as
soon
as
she
could
find
opportunity
she
was
however
too
late
the
time
at
which
the
sentences
were
to
be
carried
out
had
arrived
and
to
make
the
journey
and
obtain
admission
at
such
short
notice
required
at
least
her
husband
assistance
she
dared
not
tell
him
for
she
had
found
by
delicate
experiment
that
these
smouldering
village
beliefs
made
him
furious
if
mentioned
partly
because
he
half
entertained
them
himself
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
wait
for
another
opportunity
her
determination
received
a
fillip
from
learning
that
two
epileptic
children
had
attended
from
this
very
village
of
holmstoke
many
years
before
with
beneficial
results
though
the
experiment
had
been
strongly
condemned
by
the
neighbouring
clergy
april
may
june
passed
and
it
is
no
overstatement
to
say
that
by
the
end
of
the
month
gertrude
longed
for
the
death
of
a
instead
of
her
formal
prayers
each
night
her
unconscious
prayer
was
lord
hang
some
guilty
or
innocent
person
soon
this
time
she
made
earlier
inquiries
and
was
altogether
more
systematic
in
her
proceedings
moreover
the
season
was
summer
between
the
haymaking
and
the
harvest
and
in
the
leisure
thus
afforded
him
her
husband
had
been
away
from
home
the
assizes
were
in
july
and
she
went
to
the
inn
as
before
there
was
to
be
one
execution
only
one
for
arson
her
greatest
problem
was
not
how
to
get
to
casterbridge
but
what
means
she
should
adopt
for
obtaining
admission
to
the
jail
though
access
for
such
purposes
had
formerly
never
been
denied
the
custom
had
fallen
into
desuetude
and
in
contemplating
her
possible
difficulties
she
was
again
almost
driven
to
fall
back
upon
her
husband
but
on
sounding
him
about
the
assizes
he
was
so
uncommunicative
so
more
than
usually
cold
that
she
did
not
proceed
and
decided
that
whatever
she
did
she
would
do
alone
fortune
obdurate
hitherto
showed
her
unexpected
favour
on
the
thursday
before
the
saturday
fixed
for
the
execution
lodge
remarked
to
her
that
he
was
going
away
from
home
for
another
day
or
two
on
business
at
a
fair
and
that
he
was
sorry
he
could
not
take
her
with
him
she
exhibited
on
this
occasion
so
much
readiness
to
stay
at
home
that
he
looked
at
her
in
surprise
time
had
been
when
she
would
have
shown
deep
disappointment
at
the
loss
of
such
a
jaunt
however
he
lapsed
into
his
usual
taciturnity
and
on
the
day
named
left
holmstoke
it
was
now
her
turn
she
at
first
had
thought
of
driving
but
on
reflection
held
that
driving
would
not
do
since
it
would
necessitate
her
keeping
to
the
and
so
increase
by
tenfold
the
risk
of
her
ghastly
errand
being
found
out
she
decided
to
ride
and
avoid
the
beaten
track
notwithstanding
that
in
her
husband
stables
there
was
no
animal
just
at
present
which
by
any
stretch
of
imagination
could
be
considered
a
lady
mount
in
spite
of
his
promise
before
marriage
to
always
keep
a
mare
for
her
he
had
however
many
fine
ones
of
their
kind
and
among
the
rest
was
a
serviceable
creature
an
equine
amazon
with
a
back
as
broad
as
a
sofa
on
which
gertrude
had
occasionally
taken
an
airing
when
unwell
this
horse
she
chose
on
friday
afternoon
one
of
the
men
brought
it
round
she
was
dressed
and
before
going
down
looked
at
her
shrivelled
arm
she
said
to
it
it
had
not
been
for
you
this
terrible
ordeal
would
have
been
saved
me
when
strapping
up
the
bundle
in
which
she
carried
a
few
articles
of
clothing
she
took
occasion
to
say
to
the
servant
take
these
in
case
i
should
not
get
back
from
the
person
i
am
going
to
visit
be
alarmed
if
i
am
not
in
by
ten
and
close
up
the
house
as
usual
i
shall
be
at
home
for
certain
she
meant
then
to
privately
tell
her
husband
the
deed
accomplished
was
not
like
the
deed
projected
he
would
almost
certainly
forgive
her
and
then
the
pretty
palpitating
gertrude
lodge
went
from
her
homestead
but
though
her
goal
was
casterbridge
she
did
not
take
the
direct
route
thither
through
stickleford
her
cunning
course
at
first
was
in
precisely
the
opposite
direction
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
sight
however
she
turned
to
the
left
by
a
road
which
led
into
egdon
and
on
entering
the
heath
wheeled
round
and
set
out
in
the
true
course
due
westerly
a
more
private
way
down
the
county
could
not
be
imagined
and
as
to
direction
she
had
merely
to
keep
her
horse
head
to
a
point
a
little
to
the
right
of
the
sun
she
knew
that
she
would
light
upon
a
or
cottager
of
some
sort
from
time
to
time
from
whom
she
might
correct
her
bearing
though
the
date
was
comparatively
recent
egdon
was
much
less
fragmentary
in
character
than
now
the
attempts
successful
and
otherwise
at
cultivation
on
the
lower
slopes
which
intrude
and
break
up
the
original
heath
into
small
detached
heaths
had
not
been
carried
far
enclosure
acts
had
not
taken
effect
and
the
banks
and
fences
which
now
exclude
the
cattle
of
those
villagers
who
formerly
enjoyed
rights
of
commonage
thereon
and
the
carts
of
those
who
had
turbary
privileges
which
kept
them
in
firing
all
the
year
round
were
not
erected
gertrude
therefore
rode
along
with
no
other
obstacles
than
the
prickly
furze
bushes
the
mats
of
heather
the
white
and
the
natural
steeps
and
declivities
of
the
ground
her
horse
was
sure
if
and
slow
and
though
a
draught
animal
was
had
it
been
otherwise
she
was
not
a
woman
who
could
have
ventured
to
ride
over
such
a
bit
of
country
with
a
arm
it
was
therefore
nearly
eight
when
she
drew
rein
to
breathe
the
mare
on
the
last
outlying
high
point
of
towards
casterbridge
previous
to
leaving
egdon
for
the
cultivated
valleys
she
halted
before
a
pool
called
flanked
by
the
ends
of
two
hedges
a
railing
ran
through
the
centre
of
the
pond
dividing
it
in
half
over
the
railing
she
saw
the
low
green
country
over
the
green
trees
the
roofs
of
the
town
over
the
roofs
a
white
flat
facade
denoting
the
entrance
to
the
county
jail
on
the
roof
of
this
front
specks
were
moving
about
they
seemed
to
be
workmen
erecting
something
her
flesh
crept
she
descended
slowly
and
was
soon
amid
and
pastures
in
another
when
it
was
almost
dusk
gertrude
reached
the
white
hart
the
first
inn
of
the
town
on
that
side
little
surprise
was
excited
by
her
arrival
farmers
wives
rode
on
horseback
then
more
than
they
do
now
though
for
that
matter
lodge
was
not
imagined
to
be
a
wife
at
all
the
innkeeper
supposed
her
some
young
woman
who
had
come
to
attend
next
day
neither
her
husband
nor
herself
ever
dealt
in
casterbridge
market
so
that
she
was
unknown
while
dismounting
she
beheld
a
crowd
of
boys
standing
at
the
door
of
a
shop
just
above
the
inn
looking
inside
it
with
deep
interest
is
going
on
there
she
asked
of
the
ostler
the
rope
for
she
throbbed
responsively
and
contracted
her
arm
sold
by
the
inch
afterwards
the
man
continued
could
get
you
a
bit
miss
for
nothing
if
you
like
she
hastily
repudiated
any
such
wish
all
the
more
from
a
curious
creeping
feeling
that
the
condemned
wretch
destiny
was
becoming
interwoven
with
her
own
and
having
engaged
a
room
for
the
night
sat
down
to
think
up
to
this
time
she
had
formed
but
the
vaguest
notions
about
her
means
of
obtaining
access
to
the
prison
the
words
of
the
returned
to
her
mind
he
had
implied
that
she
should
use
her
beauty
impaired
though
it
was
as
a
in
her
inexperience
she
knew
little
about
jail
functionaries
she
had
heard
of
a
and
an
but
dimly
only
she
knew
however
that
there
must
be
a
hangman
and
to
the
hangman
she
determined
to
apply
chapter
viii
a
hermit
at
this
date
and
for
several
years
after
there
was
a
hangman
to
almost
every
jail
gertrude
found
on
inquiry
that
the
casterbridge
official
dwelt
in
a
lonely
cottage
by
a
deep
slow
river
flowing
under
the
cliff
on
which
the
prison
buildings
were
situate
the
stream
being
the
one
though
she
did
not
know
it
which
watered
the
stickleford
and
holmstoke
meads
lower
down
in
its
course
having
changed
her
dress
and
before
she
had
eaten
or
drunk
for
she
could
not
take
her
ease
till
she
had
ascertained
some
particulars
gertrude
pursued
her
way
by
a
path
along
the
to
the
cottage
indicated
passing
thus
the
outskirts
of
the
jail
she
discerned
on
the
level
roof
over
the
gateway
three
rectangular
lines
against
the
sky
where
the
specks
had
been
moving
in
her
distant
view
she
recognized
what
the
erection
was
and
passed
quickly
on
another
hundred
yards
brought
her
to
the
executioner
house
which
a
boy
pointed
out
it
stood
close
to
the
same
stream
and
was
hard
by
a
weir
the
waters
of
which
emitted
a
steady
roar
while
she
stood
hesitating
the
door
opened
and
an
old
man
came
forth
shading
a
candle
with
one
hand
locking
the
door
on
the
outside
he
turned
to
a
flight
of
wooden
steps
fixed
against
the
end
of
the
cottage
and
began
to
ascend
them
this
being
evidently
the
staircase
to
his
bedroom
gertrude
hastened
forward
but
by
the
time
she
reached
the
foot
of
the
ladder
he
was
at
the
top
she
called
to
him
loudly
enough
to
be
heard
above
the
roar
of
the
weir
he
looked
down
and
said
d
want
here
speak
to
you
a
minute
the
such
as
it
was
fell
upon
her
imploring
pale
upturned
face
and
davies
as
the
hangman
was
called
backed
down
the
ladder
was
just
going
to
bed
he
said
early
to
bed
and
early
to
rise
but
i
do
mind
stopping
a
minute
for
such
a
one
as
you
come
into
house
he
reopened
the
door
and
preceded
her
to
the
room
within
the
implements
of
his
daily
work
which
was
that
of
a
jobbing
gardener
stood
in
a
corner
and
seeing
probably
that
she
looked
rural
he
said
you
want
me
to
undertake
country
work
i
ca
come
for
i
never
leave
casterbridge
for
gentle
nor
simple
not
i
my
real
calling
is
officer
of
justice
he
added
formally
yes
that
it
i
thought
so
well
what
the
matter
about
that
is
no
use
to
come
here
about
the
knot
folks
do
come
continually
but
i
tell
one
knot
is
as
merciful
as
another
if
ye
keep
it
under
the
ear
is
the
unfortunate
man
a
relation
or
i
should
say
perhaps
looking
at
her
dress
person
who
been
in
your
employ
what
time
is
the
execution
same
as
usual
twelve
or
as
soon
after
as
the
london
coach
gets
in
we
always
wait
for
that
in
case
of
a
reprieve
a
reprieve
i
hope
not
she
said
involuntarily
hee
hee
as
a
matter
of
business
so
do
i
but
still
if
ever
a
young
fellow
deserved
to
be
let
off
this
one
does
only
just
turned
eighteen
and
only
present
by
chance
when
the
rick
was
fired
howsomever
there
not
much
risk
of
it
as
they
are
obliged
to
make
an
example
of
him
there
having
been
so
much
destruction
of
property
that
way
lately
mean
she
explained
i
want
to
touch
him
for
a
charm
a
cure
of
an
affliction
by
the
advice
of
a
man
who
has
proved
the
virtue
of
the
remedy
yes
miss
now
i
understand
i
had
such
people
come
in
past
years
but
it
did
strike
me
that
you
looked
of
a
sort
to
require
what
the
complaint
the
wrong
kind
for
this
i
be
bound
arm
she
reluctantly
showed
the
withered
skin
is
all
said
the
hangman
examining
it
said
she
he
continued
with
interest
is
the
class
o
subject
bound
to
admit
i
like
the
look
of
the
place
it
is
truly
as
suitable
for
the
cure
as
any
i
ever
saw
was
a
that
sent
whoever
he
was
can
contrive
for
me
all
that
necessary
she
said
breathlessly
should
really
have
gone
to
the
governor
of
the
jail
and
your
doctor
with
and
given
your
name
and
address
that
how
it
used
to
be
done
if
i
recollect
still
perhaps
i
can
manage
it
for
a
trifling
fee
thank
you
i
would
rather
do
it
this
way
as
i
should
like
it
kept
private
not
to
know
eh
husband
very
well
i
get
ee
a
touch
of
the
corpse
is
it
now
she
said
shuddering
he
you
mean
he
living
yet
just
inside
that
little
small
winder
up
there
in
the
glum
he
signified
the
jail
on
the
cliff
above
she
thought
of
her
husband
and
her
friends
of
course
she
said
how
am
i
to
proceed
he
took
her
to
the
door
do
you
be
waiting
at
the
little
wicket
in
the
wall
that
you
find
up
there
in
the
lane
not
later
than
one
i
will
open
it
from
the
inside
as
i
sha
come
home
to
dinner
till
he
cut
down
be
punctual
and
if
you
do
want
anybody
to
know
wear
a
veil
ah
once
i
had
such
a
daughter
as
you
she
went
away
and
climbed
the
path
above
to
assure
herself
that
she
would
be
able
to
find
the
wicket
next
day
its
outline
was
soon
visible
to
her
a
narrow
opening
in
the
outer
wall
of
the
prison
precincts
the
steep
was
so
great
that
having
reached
the
wicket
she
stopped
a
moment
to
breathe
and
looking
back
upon
the
cot
saw
the
hangman
again
ascending
his
outdoor
staircase
he
entered
the
loft
or
chamber
to
which
it
led
and
in
a
few
minutes
extinguished
his
light
the
town
clock
struck
ten
and
she
returned
to
the
white
hart
as
she
had
come

was
one
on
saturday
gertrude
lodge
having
been
admitted
to
the
jail
as
above
described
was
sitting
in
a
within
the
second
gate
which
stood
under
a
classic
archway
of
ashlar
then
comparatively
modern
and
bearing
the
inscription
jail
this
had
been
the
facade
she
saw
from
the
heath
the
day
before
near
at
hand
was
a
passage
to
the
roof
on
which
the
gallows
stood
the
town
was
thronged
and
the
market
suspended
but
gertrude
had
seen
scarcely
a
soul
having
kept
her
room
till
the
hour
of
the
appointment
she
had
proceeded
to
the
spot
by
a
way
which
avoided
the
open
space
below
the
cliff
where
the
spectators
had
gathered
but
she
could
even
now
hear
the
multitudinous
babble
of
their
voices
out
of
which
rose
at
intervals
the
hoarse
croak
of
a
single
voice
uttering
the
words
dying
speech
and
confession
there
had
been
no
reprieve
and
the
execution
was
over
but
the
crowd
still
waited
to
see
the
body
taken
down
soon
the
persistent
girl
heard
a
trampling
overhead
then
a
hand
beckoned
to
her
and
following
directions
she
went
out
and
crossed
the
inner
paved
court
beyond
the
gatehouse
her
knees
trembling
so
that
she
could
scarcely
walk
one
of
her
arms
was
out
of
its
sleeve
and
only
covered
by
her
shawl
on
the
spot
at
which
she
had
now
arrived
were
two
trestles
and
before
she
could
think
of
their
purpose
she
heard
heavy
feet
descending
stairs
somewhere
at
her
back
turn
her
head
she
would
not
or
could
not
and
rigid
in
this
position
she
was
conscious
of
a
rough
coffin
passing
her
shoulder
borne
by
four
men
it
was
open
and
in
it
lay
the
body
of
a
young
man
wearing
the
smockfrock
of
a
rustic
and
fustian
breeches
the
corpse
had
been
thrown
into
the
coffin
so
hastily
that
the
skirt
of
the
smockfrock
was
hanging
over
the
burden
was
temporarily
deposited
on
the
trestles
by
this
time
the
young
woman
state
was
such
that
a
gray
mist
seemed
to
float
before
her
eyes
on
account
of
which
and
the
veil
she
wore
she
could
scarcely
discern
anything
it
was
as
though
she
had
nearly
died
but
was
held
up
by
a
sort
of
galvanism
said
a
voice
close
at
hand
and
she
was
just
conscious
that
the
word
had
been
addressed
to
her
by
a
last
strenuous
effort
she
advanced
at
the
same
time
hearing
persons
approaching
behind
her
she
bared
her
poor
curst
arm
and
davies
uncovering
the
face
of
the
corpse
took
gertrude
hand
and
held
it
so
that
her
arm
lay
across
the
dead
man
neck
upon
a
line
the
colour
of
an
unripe
blackberry
which
surrounded
it
gertrude
shrieked
turn
o
the
blood
predicted
by
the
conjuror
had
taken
place
but
at
that
moment
a
second
shriek
rent
the
air
of
the
enclosure
it
was
not
gertrude
and
its
effect
upon
her
was
to
make
her
start
round
immediately
behind
her
stood
rhoda
brook
her
face
drawn
and
her
eyes
red
with
weeping
behind
rhoda
stood
gertrude
own
husband
his
countenance
lined
his
eyes
dim
but
without
a
tear
you
what
are
you
doing
here
he
said
hoarsely
to
come
between
us
and
our
child
now
cried
rhoda
is
the
meaning
of
what
satan
showed
me
in
the
vision
you
are
like
her
at
last
and
clutching
the
bare
arm
of
the
younger
woman
she
pulled
her
unresistingly
back
against
the
wall
immediately
brook
had
loosened
her
hold
the
fragile
young
gertrude
slid
down
against
the
feet
of
her
husband
when
he
lifted
her
up
she
was
unconscious
the
mere
sight
of
the
twain
had
been
enough
to
suggest
to
her
that
the
dead
young
man
was
rhoda
son
at
that
time
the
relatives
of
an
executed
convict
had
the
privilege
of
claiming
the
body
for
burial
if
they
chose
to
do
so
and
it
was
for
this
purpose
that
lodge
was
awaiting
the
inquest
with
rhoda
he
had
been
summoned
by
her
as
soon
as
the
young
man
was
taken
in
the
crime
and
at
different
times
since
and
he
had
attended
in
court
during
the
trial
this
was
the
he
had
been
indulging
in
of
late
the
two
wretched
parents
had
wished
to
avoid
exposure
and
hence
had
come
themselves
for
the
body
a
waggon
and
sheet
for
its
conveyance
and
covering
being
in
waiting
outside
gertrude
case
was
so
serious
that
it
was
deemed
advisable
to
call
to
her
the
surgeon
who
was
at
hand
she
was
taken
out
of
the
jail
into
the
town
but
she
never
reached
home
alive
her
delicate
vitality
sapped
perhaps
by
the
paralyzed
arm
collapsed
under
the
double
shock
that
followed
the
severe
strain
physical
and
mental
to
which
she
had
subjected
herself
during
the
previous
hours
her
blood
had
been
indeed
too
far
her
death
took
place
in
the
town
three
days
after
her
husband
was
never
seen
in
casterbridge
again
once
only
in
the
old
at
anglebury
which
he
had
so
much
frequented
and
very
seldom
in
public
anywhere
burdened
at
first
with
moodiness
and
remorse
he
eventually
changed
for
the
better
and
appeared
as
a
chastened
and
thoughtful
man
soon
after
attending
the
funeral
of
his
poor
young
wife
he
took
steps
towards
giving
up
the
farms
in
holmstoke
and
the
adjoining
parish
and
having
sold
every
head
of
his
stock
he
went
away
to
bredy
at
the
other
end
of
the
county
living
there
in
solitary
lodgings
till
his
death
two
years
later
of
a
painless
decline
it
was
then
found
that
he
had
bequeathed
the
whole
of
his
not
inconsiderable
property
to
a
reformatory
for
boys
subject
to
the
payment
of
a
small
annuity
to
rhoda
brook
if
she
could
be
found
to
claim
it
for
some
time
she
could
not
be
found
but
eventually
she
reappeared
in
her
old
parish
absolutely
refusing
however
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
provision
made
for
her
her
monotonous
milking
at
the
dairy
was
resumed
and
followed
for
many
long
years
till
her
form
became
bent
and
her
once
abundant
dark
hair
white
and
worn
away
at
the
forehead
perhaps
by
long
pressure
against
the
cows
here
sometimes
those
who
knew
her
experiences
would
stand
and
observe
her
and
wonder
what
sombre
thoughts
were
beating
inside
that
impassive
wrinkled
brow
to
the
rhythm
of
the
alternating
magazine
january
chapter
i
the
shepherd
on
the
east
hill
could
shout
out
lambing
intelligence
to
the
shepherd
on
the
west
hill
over
the
intervening
town
chimneys
without
great
inconvenience
to
his
voice
so
nearly
did
the
steep
pastures
encroach
upon
the
burghers
backyards
and
at
night
it
was
possible
to
stand
in
the
very
midst
of
the
town
and
hear
from
their
native
paddocks
on
the
lower
levels
of
greensward
the
mild
lowing
of
the
heifers
and
the
profound
warm
blowings
of
breath
in
which
those
creatures
indulge
but
the
community
which
had
jammed
itself
in
the
valley
thus
flanked
formed
a
veritable
town
with
a
real
mayor
and
corporation
and
a
staple
manufacture
during
a
certain
damp
evening
years
ago
before
the
twilight
was
far
advanced
a
pedestrian
of
professional
appearance
carrying
a
small
bag
in
his
hand
and
an
elevated
umbrella
was
descending
one
of
these
hills
by
the
turnpike
road
when
he
was
overtaken
by
a
phaeton
downe
is
that
you
said
the
driver
of
the
vehicle
a
young
man
of
pale
and
refined
appearance
up
here
with
me
and
ride
down
to
your
door
the
other
turned
a
plump
cheery
rather
face
over
his
shoulder
towards
the
hailer
good
evening
barnet
thanks
he
said
and
mounted
beside
his
acquaintance
they
were
of
the
town
which
lay
beneath
them
but
though
old
and
very
good
friends
they
were
differently
circumstanced
barnet
was
a
richer
man
than
the
struggling
young
lawyer
downe
a
fact
which
was
to
some
extent
perceptible
in
downe
manner
towards
his
companion
though
nothing
of
it
ever
showed
in
barnet
manner
towards
the
solicitor
barnet
position
in
the
town
was
none
of
his
own
making
his
father
had
been
a
very
successful
in
the
same
place
where
the
trade
was
still
carried
on
as
briskly
as
the
small
capacities
of
its
quarters
would
allow
having
acquired
a
fair
fortune
old
barnet
had
retired
from
business
bringing
up
his
son
as
a
and
it
must
be
added
as
a
young
man
is
mrs
barnet
asked
downe
barnet
was
very
well
when
i
left
home
the
other
answered
constrainedly
exchanging
his
meditative
regard
of
the
horse
for
one
of
downe
seemed
to
regret
his
inquiry
and
immediately
took
up
another
thread
of
conversation
he
congratulated
his
friend
on
his
election
as
a
he
thought
he
had
not
seen
him
since
that
event
took
place
downe
had
meant
to
call
and
congratulate
barnet
but
he
feared
that
she
had
failed
to
do
so
as
yet
barnet
seemed
hampered
in
his
replies
should
have
been
glad
to
see
you
i
my
wife
would
welcome
downe
at
any
time
as
you
know
yes
i
am
a
member
of
the
corporation
rather
an
inexperienced
member
some
of
them
say
it
is
quite
true
and
i
should
have
declined
the
honour
as
premature
having
other
things
on
my
hands
just
now
too
if
it
had
not
been
pressed
upon
me
so
very
heartily
is
one
thing
you
have
on
your
hands
which
i
can
never
quite
see
the
necessity
for
said
downe
with
freedom
the
deuce
do
you
want
to
build
that
new
mansion
for
when
you
have
already
got
such
an
excellent
house
as
the
one
you
live
in
barnet
face
acquired
a
warmer
shade
of
colour
but
as
the
question
had
been
idly
asked
by
the
solicitor
while
regarding
the
surrounding
flocks
and
fields
he
answered
after
a
moment
with
no
apparent
embarrassment
we
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
town
you
know
the
house
i
am
living
in
is
rather
old
and
inconvenient
downe
declared
that
he
had
chosen
a
pretty
site
for
the
new
building
they
would
be
able
to
see
for
miles
and
miles
from
the
windows
was
he
going
to
give
it
a
name
he
supposed
so
barnet
thought
not
there
was
no
other
house
near
that
was
likely
to
be
mistaken
for
it
and
he
did
not
care
for
a
name
i
think
it
has
a
name
downe
observed
went
past
when
was
it
this
morning
and
i
saw
something
chateau
ringdale
i
think
it
was
stuck
up
on
a
board
was
an
idea
she
we
had
for
a
short
time
said
barnet
hastily
we
have
decided
finally
to
do
without
a
name
at
any
rate
such
a
name
as
that
it
must
have
been
a
week
ago
that
you
saw
it
it
was
taken
down
last
saturday
upon
that
matter
i
am
firm
he
added
grimly
downe
murmured
in
an
unconvinced
tone
that
he
thought
he
had
seen
it
yesterday
talking
thus
they
drove
into
the
town
the
street
was
unusually
still
for
the
hour
of
seven
in
the
evening
an
increasing
drizzle
had
prevailed
since
the
afternoon
and
now
formed
a
gauze
across
the
yellow
lamps
and
trickled
with
a
gentle
rattle
down
the
heavy
roofs
of
stone
tile
that
bent
the
with
its
weight
and
in
some
instances
caused
the
walls
to
bulge
outwards
in
the
upper
story
their
route
took
them
past
the
little
the
hotel
and
onward
to
the
junction
of
a
small
street
on
the
right
consisting
of
a
row
of
those
windowed
brick
residences
of
no
particular
age
which
are
exactly
alike
wherever
found
except
in
the
people
they
contain
i
drive
you
up
to
your
door
said
barnet
when
downe
prepared
to
alight
at
the
corner
he
thereupon
turned
into
the
narrow
street
when
the
faces
of
three
little
girls
could
be
discerned
close
to
the
panes
of
a
lighted
window
a
few
yards
ahead
surmounted
by
that
of
a
young
matron
the
gaze
of
all
four
being
directed
eagerly
up
the
empty
street
are
a
fortunate
fellow
downe
barnet
continued
as
mother
and
children
disappeared
from
the
window
to
run
to
the
door
must
be
happy
if
any
man
is
i
would
give
a
hundred
such
houses
as
my
new
one
to
have
a
home
like
yours
yes
we
get
along
pretty
comfortably
replied
downe
complacently
house
downe
is
none
of
my
ordering
barnet
broke
out
revealing
a
bitterness
hitherto
suppressed
and
checking
the
horse
a
moment
to
finish
his
speech
before
delivering
up
his
passenger
house
i
have
already
is
good
enough
for
me
as
you
supposed
it
is
my
own
freehold
it
was
built
by
my
grandfather
and
is
stout
enough
for
a
castle
my
father
was
born
there
lived
there
and
died
there
i
was
born
there
and
have
always
lived
there
yet
i
must
needs
build
a
new
one
do
you
said
downe
do
i
to
preserve
peace
in
the
household
i
do
anything
for
that
but
i
do
succeed
i
was
firm
in
resisting
chateau
ringdale
however
not
that
i
would
not
have
put
up
with
the
absurdity
of
the
name
but
it
was
too
much
to
have
your
house
christened
after
lord
ringdale
because
your
wife
once
had
a
fancy
for
him
if
you
only
knew
everything
you
would
think
all
attempt
at
reconciliation
hopeless
in
your
happy
home
you
have
had
no
such
experiences
and
god
forbid
that
you
ever
should
see
here
they
are
all
ready
to
receive
you
course
and
so
will
your
wife
be
waiting
to
receive
you
said
downe
my
word
for
it
she
will
and
with
a
dinner
prepared
for
you
far
better
than
mine
hope
so
barnet
replied
dubiously
he
moved
on
to
downe
door
which
the
solicitor
family
had
already
opened
downe
descended
but
being
encumbered
with
his
bag
and
umbrella
his
foot
slipped
and
he
fell
upon
his
knees
in
the
gutter
my
dear
charles
said
his
wife
running
down
the
steps
and
quite
ignoring
the
presence
of
barnet
she
seized
hold
of
her
husband
pulled
him
to
his
feet
and
kissed
him
exclaiming
hope
you
are
not
hurt
darling
the
children
crowded
round
chiming
in
piteously
papa
all
right
said
barnet
perceiving
that
downe
was
only
a
little
muddy
and
looking
more
at
the
wife
than
at
the
husband
almost
at
any
other
time
certainly
during
his
fastidious
bachelor
years
he
would
have
thought
her
a
too
demonstrative
woman
but
those
recent
circumstances
of
his
own
life
to
which
he
had
just
alluded
made
downe
solicitude
so
affecting
that
his
eye
grew
damp
as
he
witnessed
it
bidding
the
lawyer
and
his
family
he
left
them
and
drove
slowly
into
the
main
street
towards
his
own
house
the
heart
of
barnet
was
sufficiently
impressionable
to
be
influenced
by
downe
parting
prophecy
that
he
might
not
be
so
unwelcome
home
as
he
imagined
the
dreary
night
might
at
least
on
this
one
occasion
make
downe
forecast
true
hence
it
was
in
a
suspense
that
he
could
hardly
have
believed
possible
that
he
halted
at
his
door
on
entering
his
wife
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
he
inquired
for
her
the
servant
informed
him
that
her
mistress
had
the
dressmaker
with
her
and
would
be
engaged
for
some
time
at
this
time
of
day
dined
early
sir
and
hopes
you
will
excuse
her
joining
you
this
evening
she
knew
i
was
coming
yes
sir
up
and
tell
her
i
am
come
the
servant
did
so
but
the
mistress
of
the
house
merely
transmitted
her
former
words
barnet
said
nothing
more
and
presently
sat
down
to
his
lonely
meal
which
was
eaten
abstractedly
the
domestic
scene
he
had
lately
witnessed
still
impressing
him
by
its
contrast
with
the
situation
here
his
mind
fell
back
into
past
years
upon
a
certain
pleasing
and
gentle
being
whose
face
would
loom
out
of
their
shades
at
such
times
as
these
barnet
turned
in
his
chair
and
looked
with
unfocused
eyes
in
a
direction
southward
from
where
he
sat
as
if
he
saw
not
the
room
but
a
long
way
beyond
wonder
if
she
lives
there
still
he
said
chapter
ii
he
rose
with
a
sudden
rebelliousness
put
on
his
hat
and
coat
and
went
out
of
the
house
pursuing
his
way
along
the
glistening
pavement
while
eight
was
striking
from
mary
tower
and
the
apprentices
and
shopmen
were
slamming
up
the
shutters
from
end
to
end
of
the
town
in
two
minutes
only
those
shops
which
could
boast
of
no
attendant
save
the
master
or
the
mistress
remained
with
open
eyes
these
were
ever
somewhat
less
prompt
to
exclude
customers
than
the
others
for
their
owners
ears
the
closing
hour
had
scarcely
the
cheerfulness
that
it
possessed
for
the
hired
servants
of
the
rest
yet
the
night
being
dreary
the
delay
was
not
for
long
and
their
windows
too
blinked
together
one
by
one
during
this
time
barnet
had
proceeded
with
decided
step
in
a
direction
at
right
angles
to
the
broad
main
thoroughfare
of
the
town
by
a
long
street
leading
due
southward
here
though
his
family
had
no
more
to
do
with
the
flax
manufacture
his
own
name
occasionally
greeted
him
on
gates
and
warehouses
being
used
allusively
by
small
rising
tradesmen
as
a
recommendation
in
such
words
as
from
barnet
late
manager
at
barnet
the
sight
led
him
to
reflect
upon
his
father
busy
life
and
he
questioned
if
it
had
not
been
far
happier
than
his
own
the
houses
along
the
road
became
fewer
and
presently
open
ground
appeared
between
them
on
either
side
the
track
on
the
right
hand
rising
to
a
higher
level
till
it
merged
in
a
knoll
on
the
summit
a
row
of
builders
probed
the
indistinct
sky
like
spears
and
at
their
bases
could
be
discerned
the
lower
courses
of
a
building
lately
begun
barnet
slackened
his
pace
and
stood
for
a
few
moments
without
leaving
the
centre
of
the
road
apparently
not
much
interested
in
the
sight
till
suddenly
his
eye
was
caught
by
a
post
in
the
fore
part
of
the
ground
bearing
a
white
board
at
the
top
he
went
to
the
rails
vaulted
over
and
walked
in
far
enough
to
discern
painted
upon
the
board
ringdale
a
dismal
irony
seemed
to
lie
in
the
words
and
its
effect
was
to
irritate
him
downe
then
had
spoken
truly
he
stuck
his
umbrella
into
the
sod
and
seized
the
post
with
both
hands
as
if
intending
to
loosen
and
throw
it
down
then
like
one
bewildered
by
an
opposition
which
would
exist
none
the
less
though
its
manifestations
were
removed
he
allowed
his
arms
to
sink
to
his
side
it
be
he
said
to
himself
have
declared
there
shall
be
peace
if
possible
taking
up
his
umbrella
he
quietly
left
the
enclosure
and
went
on
his
way
still
keeping
his
back
to
the
town
he
had
advanced
with
more
decision
since
passing
the
new
building
and
soon
a
hoarse
murmur
rose
upon
the
gloom
it
was
the
sound
of
the
sea
the
road
led
to
the
harbour
at
a
distance
of
a
mile
from
the
town
from
which
the
trade
of
the
district
was
fed
after
seeing
the
obnoxious
barnet
had
forgotten
to
open
his
umbrella
and
the
rain
tapped
smartly
on
his
hat
and
occasionally
stroked
his
face
as
he
went
on
though
the
lamps
were
still
continued
at
the
roadside
they
stood
at
wider
intervals
than
before
and
the
pavement
had
given
place
to
common
road
every
time
he
came
to
a
lamp
an
increasing
shine
made
itself
visible
upon
his
shoulders
till
at
last
they
quite
glistened
with
wet
the
murmur
from
the
shore
grew
stronger
but
it
was
still
some
distance
off
when
he
paused
before
one
of
the
smallest
of
the
detached
houses
by
the
wayside
standing
in
its
own
garden
the
latter
being
divided
from
the
road
by
a
row
of
wooden
palings
scrutinizing
the
spot
to
ensure
that
he
was
not
mistaken
he
opened
the
gate
and
gently
knocked
at
the
cottage
door
when
he
had
patiently
waited
minutes
enough
to
lead
any
man
in
ordinary
cases
to
knock
again
the
door
was
heard
to
open
though
it
was
impossible
to
see
by
whose
hand
there
being
no
light
in
the
passage
barnet
said
at
random
miss
savile
live
here
a
youthful
voice
assured
him
that
she
did
live
there
and
by
a
sudden
afterthought
asked
him
to
come
in
it
would
soon
get
a
light
it
said
but
the
night
being
wet
mother
had
not
thought
it
worth
while
to
trim
the
passage
lamp
trouble
yourself
to
get
a
light
for
me
said
barnet
hastily
is
not
necessary
at
all
which
is
miss
savile
the
young
person
whose
white
pinafore
could
just
be
discerned
signified
a
door
in
the
side
of
the
passage
and
barnet
went
forward
at
the
same
moment
so
that
no
light
should
fall
upon
his
face
on
entering
the
room
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
pausing
till
he
heard
the
retreating
footsteps
of
the
child
he
found
himself
in
an
apartment
which
was
simply
and
neatly
though
not
poorly
furnished
everything
from
the
miniature
chiffonnier
to
the
shining
little
daguerreotype
which
formed
the
central
ornament
of
the
mantelpiece
being
in
scrupulous
order
the
picture
was
enclosed
by
a
frame
of
embroidered
evidently
the
work
of
feminine
hands
and
it
was
the
portrait
of
a
thin
faced
elderly
lieutenant
in
the
navy
from
behind
the
lamp
on
the
table
a
female
form
now
rose
into
view
that
of
a
young
girl
and
a
resemblance
between
her
and
the
portrait
was
early
discoverable
she
had
been
so
absorbed
in
some
occupation
on
the
other
side
of
the
lamp
as
to
have
barely
found
time
to
realize
her
presence
they
both
remained
standing
for
a
few
seconds
without
speaking
the
face
that
confronted
barnet
had
a
beautiful
outline
the
raffaelesque
oval
of
its
contour
was
remarkable
for
an
english
countenance
and
that
countenance
housed
in
a
remote
to
an
harbour
but
her
features
did
not
do
justice
to
this
splendid
beginning
nature
had
recollected
that
she
was
not
in
italy
and
the
young
lady
lineaments
though
not
so
inconsistent
as
to
make
her
plain
would
have
been
accepted
rather
as
pleasing
than
as
correct
the
preoccupied
expression
which
like
images
on
the
retina
remained
with
her
for
a
moment
after
the
state
that
caused
it
had
ceased
now
changed
into
a
reserved
and
slightly
indignant
look
in
which
the
blood
diffused
itself
quickly
across
her
cheek
and
additional
brightness
broke
the
shade
of
her
rather
heavy
eyes
know
i
have
no
business
here
he
said
answering
the
look
i
had
a
great
wish
to
see
you
and
inquire
how
you
were
you
can
give
your
hand
to
me
seeing
how
often
i
have
held
it
in
past
days
would
rather
forget
than
remember
all
that
barnet
she
answered
as
she
coldly
complied
with
the
request
i
think
of
the
circumstances
of
our
last
meeting
i
can
hardly
consider
it
kind
of
you
to
allude
to
such
a
thing
as
our
past
or
indeed
to
come
here
at
all
was
no
harm
in
it
surely
i
do
trouble
you
often
lucy
have
not
had
the
honour
of
a
visit
from
you
for
a
very
long
time
certainly
and
i
did
not
expect
it
now
she
said
with
the
same
stiffness
in
her
air
hope
barnet
is
very
well
yes
he
impatiently
returned
least
i
suppose
so
though
i
only
speak
from
inference
she
is
your
wife
sir
said
the
young
girl
tremulously
the
unwonted
tones
of
a
man
voice
in
that
feminine
chamber
had
startled
a
canary
that
was
roosting
in
its
cage
by
the
window
the
bird
awoke
hastily
and
fluttered
against
the
bars
she
went
and
stilled
it
by
laying
her
face
against
the
cage
and
murmuring
a
coaxing
sound
it
might
partly
have
been
done
to
still
herself
did
come
to
talk
of
barnet
he
pursued
came
to
talk
of
you
of
yourself
alone
to
inquire
how
you
are
getting
on
since
your
great
loss
and
he
turned
towards
the
portrait
of
her
father
am
getting
on
fairly
well
thank
you
the
force
of
her
utterance
was
scarcely
borne
out
by
her
look
but
barnet
courteously
reproached
himself
for
not
having
guessed
a
thing
so
natural
and
to
dissipate
all
embarrassment
added
as
he
bent
over
the
table
were
you
doing
when
i
came
painting
flowers
and
by
candlelight
no
she
said
painting
them
only
sketching
the
outlines
i
do
that
at
night
to
save
time
i
have
to
get
three
dozen
done
by
the
end
of
the
month
barnet
looked
as
if
he
regretted
it
deeply
will
wear
your
poor
eyes
out
he
said
with
more
sentiment
than
he
had
hitherto
shown
ought
not
to
do
it
there
was
a
time
when
i
should
have
said
you
must
not
well
i
almost
wish
i
had
never
seen
light
with
my
own
eyes
when
i
think
of
that
this
a
time
or
place
for
recalling
such
matters
she
asked
with
dignity
used
to
have
a
gentlemanly
respect
for
me
and
for
yourself
do
speak
any
more
as
you
have
spoken
and
do
come
again
i
can
not
think
that
this
visit
is
serious
or
was
closely
considered
by
you
well
i
came
to
see
you
as
an
old
and
good
friend
not
to
mince
matters
to
visit
a
woman
i
loved
do
be
angry
i
could
not
help
doing
it
so
many
things
brought
you
into
my
mind
this
evening
i
fell
in
with
an
acquaintance
and
when
i
saw
how
happy
he
was
with
his
wife
and
family
welcoming
him
home
though
with
only
of
my
income
and
chances
and
thought
what
might
have
been
in
my
case
it
fairly
broke
down
my
discretion
and
off
i
came
here
now
i
am
here
i
feel
that
i
am
wrong
to
some
extent
but
the
feeling
that
i
should
like
to
see
you
and
talk
of
those
we
used
to
know
in
common
was
very
strong
that
can
be
the
case
a
little
more
time
must
pass
said
miss
savile
quietly
time
long
enough
for
me
to
regard
with
some
calmness
what
at
present
i
remember
far
too
impatiently
though
it
may
be
you
almost
forget
it
indeed
you
must
have
forgotten
it
long
before
you
acted
as
you
did
her
voice
grew
stronger
and
more
vivacious
as
she
added
i
am
doing
my
best
to
forget
it
too
and
i
know
i
shall
succeed
from
the
progress
i
have
made
already
she
had
remained
standing
till
now
when
she
turned
and
sat
down
facing
half
away
from
him
barnet
watched
her
moodily
it
is
only
what
i
deserve
he
said
pricked
me
on
no
it
was
not
ambition
it
was
wrongheadedness
had
i
but
reflected
he
broke
out
vehemently
always
remember
this
lucy
if
you
had
written
to
me
only
one
little
line
after
that
misunderstanding
i
declare
i
should
have
come
back
to
you
that
ruined
me
he
slowly
walked
as
far
as
the
little
room
would
allow
him
to
go
and
remained
with
his
eyes
on
the
skirting
barnet
how
could
i
write
to
you
there
was
no
opening
for
my
doing
so
there
ought
to
have
been
said
barnet
turning
was
my
fault
i
do
know
anything
about
that
but
as
there
had
been
nothing
said
by
me
which
required
any
explanation
by
letter
i
did
not
send
one
everything
was
so
indefinite
and
feeling
your
position
to
be
so
much
wealthier
than
mine
i
fancied
i
might
have
mistaken
your
meaning
and
when
i
heard
of
the
other
lady
a
woman
of
whose
family
even
you
might
be
proud
i
thought
how
foolish
i
had
been
and
said
nothing
i
suppose
it
was
destiny
accident
i
do
know
what
that
separated
us
dear
lucy
anyhow
you
were
the
woman
i
ought
to
have
made
my
wife
and
i
let
you
slip
like
the
foolish
man
that
i
was
barnet
she
said
almost
in
tears
revive
the
subject
to
me
i
am
the
wrong
one
to
console
you
think
sir
you
should
not
be
here
it
would
be
so
bad
for
me
if
it
were
known
would
it
would
indeed
he
said
hastily
am
not
right
in
doing
this
and
i
wo
do
it
again
is
a
very
common
folly
of
human
nature
you
know
to
think
the
course
you
did
not
adopt
must
have
been
the
best
she
continued
with
gentle
solicitude
as
she
followed
him
to
the
door
of
the
room
you
know
that
i
should
have
accepted
you
even
if
you
had
asked
me
to
be
your
wife
at
this
his
eye
met
hers
and
she
dropped
her
gaze
she
knew
that
her
voice
belied
her
there
was
a
silence
till
she
looked
up
to
add
in
a
voice
of
soothing
playfulness
family
was
so
much
poorer
than
yours
even
before
i
lost
my
dear
father
that
perhaps
your
companions
would
have
made
it
unpleasant
for
us
on
account
of
my
deficiencies
disposition
would
soon
have
won
them
round
said
barnet
she
archly
expostulated
never
mind
my
disposition
try
to
make
it
up
with
your
wife
those
are
my
commands
to
you
and
now
you
are
to
leave
me
at
once
will
i
must
make
the
best
of
it
all
i
suppose
he
replied
more
cheerfully
than
he
had
as
yet
spoken
i
shall
never
again
meet
with
such
a
dear
girl
as
you
and
he
suddenly
opened
the
door
and
left
her
alone
when
his
glance
again
fell
on
the
lamps
that
were
sparsely
ranged
along
the
dreary
level
road
his
eyes
were
in
a
state
which
showed
like
motes
of
light
radiating
from
each
flame
into
the
surrounding
air
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
barnet
observed
a
man
under
an
umbrella
walking
parallel
with
himself
presently
this
man
left
the
footway
and
gradually
converged
on
barnet
course
the
latter
then
saw
that
it
was
charlson
a
surgeon
of
the
town
who
owed
him
money
charlson
was
a
man
not
without
ability
yet
he
did
not
prosper
sundry
circumstances
stood
in
his
way
as
a
medical
practitioner
he
was
needy
he
was
not
a
coddle
he
gossiped
with
men
instead
of
with
women
he
had
married
a
stranger
instead
of
one
of
the
town
young
ladies
and
he
was
given
to
conversational
buffoonery
moreover
his
look
was
quite
erroneous
those
only
proper
features
in
the
family
doctor
the
quiet
eye
and
the
thin
straight
passionless
lips
which
never
curl
in
public
either
for
laughter
or
for
scorn
were
not
his
he
had
a
mouth
and
a
bold
black
eye
that
made
timid
people
nervous
his
companions
were
what
in
old
times
would
have
been
called
boon
companions
an
expression
which
though
of
irreproachable
root
suggests
fraternization
carried
to
the
point
of
unscrupulousness
all
this
was
against
him
in
the
little
town
of
his
adoption
charlson
had
been
in
difficulties
and
to
oblige
him
barnet
had
put
his
name
to
a
bill
and
as
he
had
expected
was
called
upon
to
meet
it
when
it
fell
due
it
had
been
only
a
matter
of
fifty
pounds
which
barnet
could
well
afford
to
lose
and
he
bore
no
to
the
thriftless
surgeon
on
account
of
it
but
charlson
had
a
little
too
much
brazen
indifferentism
in
his
composition
to
be
altogether
a
desirable
acquaintance
hope
to
be
able
to
make
that
little
right
with
you
in
the
course
of
three
weeks
barnet
said
charlson
with
friendliness
barnet
replied
that
there
was
no
hurry
this
particular
three
weeks
had
moved
on
in
advance
of
charlson
present
with
the
precision
of
a
shadow
for
some
considerable
time
had
a
dream
charlson
continued
barnet
knew
from
his
tone
that
the
surgeon
was
going
to
begin
his
characteristic
nonsense
and
did
not
encourage
him
had
a
dream
repeated
charlson
who
required
no
encouragement
dreamed
that
a
gentleman
who
has
been
very
kind
to
me
married
a
haughty
lady
in
haste
before
he
had
quite
forgotten
a
nice
little
girl
he
knew
before
and
that
one
wet
evening
like
the
present
as
i
was
walking
up
the
i
saw
him
come
out
of
that
dear
little
girl
present
abode
barnet
glanced
towards
the
speaker
the
rays
from
a
neighbouring
lamp
struck
through
the
drizzle
under
charlson
umbrella
so
as
just
to
illumine
his
face
against
the
shade
behind
and
show
that
his
eye
was
turned
up
under
the
outer
corner
of
its
lid
whence
it
leered
with
impish
jocoseness
as
he
thrust
his
tongue
into
his
cheek
said
barnet
gravely
have
no
more
of
that
no
of
course
not
charlson
hastily
answered
seeing
that
his
humour
had
carried
him
too
far
as
it
had
done
many
times
before
he
was
profuse
in
his
apologies
but
barnet
did
not
reply
of
one
thing
he
was
certain
that
scandal
was
a
plant
of
quick
root
and
that
he
was
bound
to
obey
lucy
injunction
for
lucy
own
sake
chapter
iii
he
did
so
to
the
letter
and
though
as
the
crocus
followed
the
snowdrop
and
the
daffodil
the
crocus
in
lucy
garden
the
was
a
not
unpleasant
place
to
walk
in
barnet
feet
never
trod
its
stones
much
less
approached
her
door
he
avoided
a
saunter
that
way
as
he
would
have
avoided
a
dangerous
dram
and
took
his
airings
a
long
distance
northward
among
severely
square
and
brown
ploughed
fields
where
no
other
townsman
came
sometimes
he
went
round
by
the
lower
lanes
of
the
borough
where
the
stretched
in
which
his
family
formerly
had
share
and
looked
at
the
walking
backwards
overhung
by
and
bushes
and
intruded
on
by
cows
and
calves
as
if
trade
had
established
itself
there
at
considerable
inconvenience
to
nature
one
morning
when
the
sun
was
so
warm
as
to
raise
a
steam
from
the
eastern
slopes
of
those
flanking
hills
that
looked
so
lovely
above
the
old
roofs
but
made
every
house
in
the
town
as
smoky
as
tophet
barnet
glanced
from
the
windows
of
the
room
for
lack
of
interest
in
what
was
proceeding
within
several
members
of
the
corporation
were
present
but
there
was
not
much
business
doing
and
in
a
few
minutes
downe
came
leisurely
across
to
him
saying
that
he
seldom
saw
barnet
now
barnet
owned
that
he
was
not
often
present
downe
looked
at
the
crimson
curtain
which
hung
down
beside
the
panes
reflecting
its
hot
hues
into
their
faces
and
then
out
of
the
window
at
that
moment
there
passed
along
the
street
a
tall
commanding
lady
in
whom
the
solicitor
recognized
barnet
wife
barnet
had
done
the
same
thing
and
turned
away
will
be
all
right
some
day
said
downe
with
cheering
sympathy
have
heard
then
of
her
last
outbreak
downe
depressed
his
cheerfulness
to
its
very
reverse
in
a
moment
i
have
not
heard
of
anything
serious
he
said
with
as
long
a
face
as
one
naturally
round
could
be
turned
into
at
short
notice
only
hear
vague
reports
of
such
things
may
think
it
will
be
all
right
said
barnet
drily
i
have
a
different
opinion
no
downe
we
must
look
the
thing
in
the
face
not
poppy
nor
mandragora
however
how
are
your
wife
and
children
downe
said
that
they
were
all
well
thanks
they
were
out
that
morning
somewhere
he
was
just
looking
to
see
if
they
were
walking
that
way
ah
there
they
were
just
coming
down
the
street
and
downe
pointed
to
the
figures
of
two
children
with
a
nursemaid
and
a
lady
walking
behind
them
will
come
out
and
speak
to
her
he
asked
this
morning
the
fact
is
i
do
care
to
speak
to
anybody
just
now
are
too
sensitive
barnet
at
school
i
remember
you
used
to
get
as
red
as
a
rose
if
anybody
uttered
a
word
that
hurt
your
feelings
barnet
mused
he
admitted
is
a
grain
of
truth
in
that
it
is
because
of
that
i
often
try
to
make
peace
at
home
life
would
be
tolerable
then
at
any
rate
even
if
not
particularly
bright
have
thought
more
than
once
of
proposing
a
little
plan
to
you
said
downe
with
some
hesitation
do
know
whether
it
will
meet
your
views
but
take
it
or
leave
it
as
you
choose
in
fact
it
was
my
wife
who
suggested
it
that
she
would
be
very
glad
to
call
on
barnet
and
get
into
her
confidence
she
seems
to
think
that
barnet
is
rather
alone
in
the
town
and
without
advisers
her
impression
is
that
your
wife
will
listen
to
reason
emily
has
a
wonderful
way
of
winning
the
hearts
of
people
of
her
own
sex
of
the
other
sex
too
i
think
she
is
a
charming
woman
and
you
were
a
lucky
fellow
to
find
her
perhaps
i
was
simpered
downe
trying
to
wear
an
aspect
of
being
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
feel
pride
she
will
be
likely
to
find
out
what
ruffles
barnet
perhaps
it
is
some
misunderstanding
you
know
something
that
she
is
too
proud
to
ask
you
to
explain
or
some
little
thing
in
your
conduct
that
irritates
her
because
she
does
not
fully
comprehend
you
the
truth
is
emily
would
have
been
more
ready
to
make
advances
if
she
had
been
quite
sure
of
her
fitness
for
society
who
has
of
course
been
accustomed
to
london
people
of
good
position
which
made
emily
fearful
of
intruding
barnet
expressed
his
warmest
thanks
for
the
proposition
there
was
reason
in
downe
fear
that
he
owned
do
let
her
call
he
said
is
no
woman
in
england
i
would
so
soon
trust
on
such
an
errand
i
am
afraid
there
will
not
be
any
brilliant
result
still
i
shall
take
it
as
the
kindest
and
nicest
thing
if
she
will
try
it
and
not
be
frightened
at
a
repulse
when
barnet
and
downe
had
parted
the
former
went
to
the
town
bank
of
which
he
was
a
trustee
and
endeavoured
to
forget
his
troubles
in
the
contemplation
of
low
sums
of
money
and
figures
in
a
network
of
red
and
blue
lines
he
sat
and
watched
the
making
their
deposits
to
which
at
intervals
he
signed
his
name
before
he
left
in
the
afternoon
downe
put
his
head
inside
the
door
has
seen
barnet
he
said
in
a
low
voice
has
got
barnet
promise
to
take
her
for
a
drive
down
to
the
shore
if
it
is
fine
good
afternoon
barnet
shook
downe
by
the
hand
without
speaking
and
downe
went
away
chapter
iv
the
next
day
was
as
fine
as
the
arrangement
could
possibly
require
as
the
sun
passed
the
meridian
and
declined
westward
the
tall
shadows
from
the
of
barnet
rising
residence
streaked
the
ground
as
far
as
to
the
middle
of
the
highway
barnet
himself
was
there
inspecting
the
progress
of
the
works
for
the
first
time
during
several
weeks
a
building
in
an
town
years
ago
did
not
as
in
the
modern
fashion
rise
from
the
sod
like
a
booth
at
a
fair
the
foundations
and
lower
courses
were
put
in
and
allowed
to
settle
for
many
weeks
before
the
superstructure
was
built
up
and
a
whole
summer
of
drying
was
hardly
sufficient
to
do
justice
to
the
important
issues
involved
barnet
stood
within
a
which
had
as
yet
received
no
frame
and
thence
looked
down
a
slope
into
the
road
the
wheels
of
a
chaise
were
heard
and
then
his
handsome
xantippe
in
the
company
of
downe
drove
past
on
their
way
to
the
shore
they
were
driving
slowly
there
was
a
pleasing
light
in
downe
face
which
seemed
faintly
to
reflect
itself
upon
the
countenance
of
her
companion
that
politesse
du
coeur
which
was
so
natural
to
her
having
possibly
begun
already
to
work
results
but
whatever
the
situation
barnet
resolved
not
to
interfere
or
do
anything
to
hazard
the
promise
of
the
day
he
might
well
afford
to
trust
the
issue
to
another
when
he
could
never
direct
it
but
to
ill
himself
his
wife
clenched
in
its
glove
her
stiff
erect
figure
clad
in
velvet
and
lace
and
her
face
passed
on
exhibiting
their
owner
as
one
fixed
for
ever
above
the
level
of
her
companion
socially
by
her
early
breeding
and
materially
by
her
higher
cushion
barnet
decided
to
allow
them
a
proper
time
to
themselves
and
then
stroll
down
to
the
shore
and
drive
them
home
after
lingering
on
at
the
house
for
another
hour
he
started
with
this
intention
a
few
hundred
yards
below
ringdale
stood
the
cottage
in
which
the
late
daughter
had
her
lodging
barnet
had
not
been
so
far
that
way
for
a
long
time
and
as
he
approached
the
forbidden
ground
a
curious
warmth
passed
into
him
which
led
him
to
perceive
that
unless
he
were
careful
he
might
have
to
fight
the
battle
with
himself
about
lucy
over
again
a
tenth
of
his
present
excuse
would
however
have
justified
him
in
travelling
by
that
road
he
came
opposite
the
dwelling
and
turned
his
eyes
for
a
momentary
glance
into
the
little
garden
that
stretched
from
the
palings
to
the
door
lucy
was
in
the
enclosure
she
was
walking
and
stooping
to
gather
some
flowers
possibly
for
the
purpose
of
painting
them
for
she
moved
about
quickly
as
if
anxious
to
save
time
she
did
not
see
him
he
might
have
passed
unnoticed
but
a
sensation
which
was
not
in
strict
unison
with
his
previous
sentiments
that
day
led
him
to
pause
in
his
walk
and
watch
her
she
went
nimbly
round
and
round
the
beds
of
anemones
tulips
jonquils
polyanthuses
and
other
flowers
looking
a
very
charming
figure
in
her
bonnet
and
with
an
incomplete
nosegay
in
her
left
hand
raising
herself
to
pull
down
a
lilac
blossom
she
observed
him
barnet
she
said
innocently
smiling
i
have
been
thinking
of
you
many
times
since
barnet
went
by
in
the
and
now
here
you
are
lucy
he
said
then
she
seemed
to
recall
particulars
of
their
last
meeting
and
he
believed
that
she
flushed
though
it
might
have
been
only
the
fancy
of
his
own
supersensitivenesss
am
going
to
the
harbour
he
added
you
lucy
remarked
simply
great
many
people
begin
to
go
there
now
the
summer
is
drawing
on
her
face
had
come
more
into
his
view
as
she
spoke
and
he
noticed
how
much
thinner
and
paler
it
was
than
when
he
had
seen
it
last
how
weary
you
look
tell
me
can
i
help
you
he
was
going
to
cry
i
do
he
thought
will
be
the
ruin
of
us
both
he
merely
said
that
the
afternoon
was
fine
and
went
on
his
way
as
he
went
a
sudden
blast
of
air
came
over
the
hill
as
if
in
contradiction
to
his
words
and
spoilt
the
previous
quiet
of
the
scene
the
wind
had
already
shifted
violently
and
now
smelt
of
the
sea
the
soon
began
to
justify
its
name
a
gap
appeared
in
the
rampart
of
hills
which
shut
out
the
sea
and
on
the
left
of
the
opening
rose
a
vertical
cliff
coloured
a
burning
orange
by
the
sunlight
the
companion
cliff
on
the
right
being
livid
in
shade
between
these
cliffs
like
the
libyan
bay
which
sheltered
the
shipwrecked
trojans
was
a
little
haven
seemingly
a
beginning
made
by
nature
herself
of
a
perfect
harbour
which
appealed
to
the
as
only
requiring
a
little
human
industry
to
finish
it
and
make
it
famous
the
ground
on
each
side
as
far
back
as
the
daisied
slopes
that
bounded
the
interior
valley
being
a
mere
layer
of
blown
sand
but
the
burgesses
a
mile
inland
had
in
the
course
of
ten
centuries
responded
many
times
to
that
mute
appeal
with
the
result
that
the
tides
had
invariably
choked
up
their
works
with
sand
and
shingle
as
soon
as
completed
there
were
but
few
houses
here
a
rough
pier
a
few
boats
some
stores
an
inn
a
residence
or
two
a
ketch
unloading
in
the
harbour
were
the
chief
features
of
the
settlement
on
the
open
ground
by
the
shore
stood
his
wife
empty
the
boy
in
attendance
holding
the
horse
when
barnet
drew
nearer
he
saw
an
spot
moving
swiftly
along
beneath
the
radiant
base
of
the
eastern
cliff
which
proved
to
be
a
man
in
a
jersey
running
with
all
his
might
he
held
up
his
hand
to
barnet
as
it
seemed
and
they
approached
each
other
the
man
was
local
but
a
stranger
to
him
is
it
my
man
said
barnet
terrible
calamity
the
boatman
hastily
explained
two
ladies
had
been
capsized
in
a
boat
they
were
downe
and
barnet
of
the
old
town
they
had
driven
down
there
that
afternoon
they
had
alighted
and
it
was
so
fine
that
after
walking
about
a
little
while
they
had
been
tempted
to
go
out
for
a
short
sail
round
the
cliff
just
as
they
were
putting
in
to
the
shore
the
wind
shifted
with
a
sudden
gust
the
boat
listed
over
and
it
was
thought
they
were
both
drowned
how
it
could
have
happened
was
beyond
his
mind
to
fathom
for
john
green
knew
how
to
sail
a
boat
as
well
as
any
man
there
is
the
way
to
the
place
said
barnet
it
was
just
round
the
cliff
to
the
carriage
and
tell
the
boy
to
bring
it
to
the
place
as
soon
as
you
can
then
go
to
the
harbour
inn
and
tell
them
to
ride
to
town
for
a
doctor
have
they
been
got
out
of
the
water
lady
has
barnet
downe
it
is
feared
has
fleeted
out
to
sea
barnet
ran
on
to
that
part
of
the
shore
which
the
cliff
had
hitherto
obscured
from
his
view
and
there
discerned
a
long
way
ahead
a
group
of
fishermen
standing
as
soon
as
he
came
up
one
or
two
recognized
him
and
not
liking
to
meet
his
eye
turned
aside
with
misgiving
he
went
amidst
them
and
saw
a
small
lying
draggled
at
the
edge
and
on
the
sloping
shingle
beside
it
a
soaked
and
sandy
form
in
the
velvet
dress
and
yellow
gloves
of
his
wife
chapter
v
all
had
been
done
that
could
be
done
barnet
was
in
her
own
house
under
medical
hands
but
the
result
was
still
uncertain
barnet
had
acted
as
if
devotion
to
his
wife
were
the
dominant
passion
of
his
existence
there
had
been
much
to
decide
whether
to
attempt
restoration
of
the
apparently
lifeless
body
as
it
lay
on
the
shore
whether
to
carry
her
to
the
harbour
inn
whether
to
drive
with
her
at
once
to
his
own
house
the
first
course
with
no
skilled
help
or
appliances
near
at
hand
had
seemed
hopeless
the
second
course
would
have
occupied
nearly
as
much
time
as
a
drive
to
the
town
owing
to
the
intervening
ridges
of
shingle
and
the
necessity
of
crossing
the
harbour
by
boat
to
get
to
the
house
added
to
which
much
time
must
have
elapsed
before
a
doctor
could
have
arrived
down
there
by
bringing
her
home
in
the
carriage
some
precious
moments
had
slipped
by
but
she
had
been
laid
in
her
own
bed
in
seven
minutes
a
doctor
called
to
her
side
and
every
possible
restorative
brought
to
bear
upon
her
at
what
a
tearing
pace
he
had
driven
up
that
road
through
the
yellow
evening
sunlight
the
shadows
flapping
irksomely
into
his
eyes
as
each
wayside
object
rushed
past
between
him
and
the
west
tired
workmen
with
their
baskets
at
their
backs
had
turned
on
their
homeward
journey
to
wonder
at
his
speed
halfway
between
the
shore
and
town
he
had
met
charlson
who
had
been
the
first
surgeon
to
hear
of
the
accident
he
was
accompanied
by
his
assistant
in
a
gig
barnet
had
sent
on
the
latter
to
the
coast
in
case
that
downe
poor
wife
should
by
that
time
have
been
reclaimed
from
the
waves
and
had
brought
charlson
back
with
him
to
the
house
barnet
presence
was
not
needed
here
and
he
felt
it
to
be
his
next
duty
to
set
off
at
once
and
find
downe
that
no
other
than
himself
might
break
the
news
to
him
he
was
quite
sure
that
no
chance
had
been
lost
for
downe
by
his
leaving
the
shore
by
the
time
that
barnet
had
been
laid
in
the
carriage
a
much
larger
group
had
assembled
to
lend
assistance
in
finding
her
friend
rendering
his
own
help
superfluous
but
the
duty
of
breaking
the
news
was
made
doubly
painful
by
the
circumstance
that
the
catastrophe
which
had
befallen
downe
was
solely
the
result
of
her
own
and
her
husband
towards
himself
he
found
downe
in
his
office
when
the
solicitor
comprehended
the
intelligence
he
turned
pale
stood
up
and
remained
for
a
moment
perfectly
still
as
if
bereft
of
his
faculties
then
his
shoulders
heaved
he
pulled
out
his
handkerchief
and
began
to
cry
like
a
child
his
sobs
might
have
been
heard
in
the
next
room
he
seemed
to
have
no
idea
of
going
to
the
shore
or
of
doing
anything
but
when
barnet
took
him
gently
by
the
hand
and
proposed
to
start
at
once
he
quietly
acquiesced
neither
uttering
any
further
word
nor
making
any
effort
to
repress
his
tears
barnet
accompanied
him
to
the
shore
where
finding
that
no
trace
had
as
yet
been
seen
of
downe
and
that
his
stay
would
be
of
no
avail
he
left
downe
with
his
friends
and
the
young
doctor
and
once
more
hastened
back
to
his
own
house
at
the
door
he
met
charlson
barnet
said
have
just
come
down
said
the
doctor
have
done
everything
but
without
result
i
sympathize
with
you
in
your
bereavement
barnet
did
not
much
appreciate
charlson
sympathy
which
sounded
to
his
ears
as
something
of
a
mockery
from
the
lips
of
a
man
who
knew
what
charlson
knew
about
their
domestic
relations
indeed
there
seemed
an
odd
spark
in
charlson
full
black
eye
as
he
said
the
words
but
that
might
have
been
imaginary
barnet
charlson
resumed
little
matter
between
us
i
hope
to
settle
it
finally
in
three
weeks
at
least
mind
that
now
said
barnet
abruptly
he
directed
the
surgeon
to
go
to
the
harbour
in
case
his
services
might
even
now
be
necessary
there
and
himself
entered
the
house
the
servants
were
coming
from
his
wife
chamber
looking
helplessly
at
each
other
and
at
him
he
passed
them
by
and
entered
the
room
where
he
stood
mutely
regarding
the
bed
for
a
few
minutes
after
which
he
walked
into
his
own
adjoining
and
there
paced
up
and
down
in
a
minute
or
two
he
noticed
what
a
strange
and
total
silence
had
come
over
the
upper
part
of
the
house
his
own
movements
muffled
as
they
were
by
the
carpet
seemed
noisy
and
his
thoughts
to
disturb
the
air
like
articulate
utterances
his
eye
glanced
through
the
window
far
down
the
road
to
the
harbour
a
roof
detained
his
gaze
out
of
it
rose
a
red
chimney
and
out
of
the
red
chimney
a
curl
of
smoke
as
from
a
fire
newly
kindled
he
had
often
seen
such
a
sight
before
in
that
house
lived
lucy
savile
and
the
smoke
was
from
the
fire
which
was
regularly
lighted
at
this
time
to
make
her
tea
after
that
he
went
back
to
the
bedroom
and
stood
there
some
time
regarding
his
wife
silent
form
she
was
a
woman
some
years
older
than
himself
but
had
not
by
any
means
overpassed
the
maturity
of
good
looks
and
vigour
her
passionate
features
firm
and
statuesque
in
life
were
doubly
so
now
her
mouth
and
brow
beneath
her
purplish
black
hair
showed
only
too
clearly
that
the
turbulency
of
character
which
had
made
a
of
his
house
had
been
no
temporary
phase
of
her
existence
while
he
reflected
he
suddenly
said
to
himself
i
wonder
if
all
has
been
done
the
thought
was
led
up
to
by
his
having
fancied
that
his
wife
features
lacked
in
its
complete
form
the
expression
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
associate
with
the
faces
of
those
whose
spirits
have
fled
for
ever
the
effacement
of
life
was
not
so
marked
but
that
entering
uninformed
he
might
have
supposed
her
sleeping
her
complexion
was
that
seen
in
the
numerous
faded
portraits
by
sir
joshua
reynolds
it
was
pallid
in
comparison
with
life
but
there
was
visible
on
a
close
inspection
the
remnant
of
what
had
once
been
a
flush
the
keeping
between
the
cheeks
and
the
hollows
of
the
face
being
thus
preserved
although
positive
colour
was
gone
long
orange
rays
of
evening
sun
stole
in
through
chinks
in
the
blind
striking
on
the
large
mirror
and
being
thence
reflected
upon
the
crimson
hangings
and
woodwork
of
the
heavy
bedstead
so
that
the
general
tone
of
light
was
remarkably
warm
and
it
was
probable
that
something
might
be
due
to
this
circumstance
still
the
fact
impressed
him
as
strange
charlson
had
been
gone
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
could
it
be
possible
that
he
had
left
too
soon
and
that
his
attempts
to
restore
her
had
operated
so
sluggishly
as
only
now
to
have
made
themselves
felt
barnet
laid
his
hand
upon
her
chest
and
fancied
that
ever
and
anon
a
faint
flutter
of
palpitation
gentle
as
that
of
a
butterfly
wing
disturbed
the
stillness
there
ceasing
for
a
time
then
struggling
to
go
on
then
breaking
down
in
weakness
and
ceasing
again
barnet
mother
had
been
an
active
practitioner
of
the
healing
art
among
her
poorer
neighbours
and
her
inspirations
had
all
been
derived
from
an
octavo
volume
of
domestic
medicine
which
at
this
moment
was
lying
as
it
had
lain
for
many
years
on
a
shelf
in
barnet
he
hastily
fetched
it
and
there
read
under
the
head
for
the
recovery
of
any
person
who
has
not
been
immersed
for
a
longer
period
than
should
be
continued
for
at
least
four
hours
as
there
have
been
many
cases
in
which
returning
life
has
made
itself
visible
even
after
a
longer
interval
however
a
weak
action
of
any
of
the
organs
show
itself
when
the
case
seems
almost
hopeless
our
efforts
must
be
redoubled
the
feeble
spark
in
this
case
requires
to
be
solicited
it
will
certainly
disappear
under
a
relaxation
of
labour
barnet
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
now
barely
two
hours
and
a
half
from
the
time
when
he
had
first
heard
of
the
accident
he
threw
aside
the
book
and
turned
quickly
to
reach
a
stimulant
which
had
previously
been
used
pulling
up
the
blind
for
more
light
his
eye
glanced
out
of
the
window
there
he
saw
that
red
chimney
still
smoking
cheerily
and
that
roof
and
through
the
roof
that
somebody
his
mechanical
movements
stopped
his
hand
remained
on
the
and
he
seemed
to
become
breathless
as
if
he
had
suddenly
found
himself
treading
a
high
rope
while
he
stood
a
sparrow
lighted
on
the
windowsill
saw
him
and
flew
away
next
a
man
and
a
dog
walked
over
one
of
the
green
hills
which
bulged
above
the
roofs
of
the
town
but
barnet
took
no
notice
we
may
wonder
what
were
the
exact
images
that
passed
through
his
mind
during
those
minutes
of
gazing
upon
lucy
savile
house
the
sparrow
the
man
and
the
dog
and
lucy
savile
house
again
there
are
honest
men
who
will
not
admit
to
their
thoughts
even
as
idle
hypotheses
views
of
the
future
that
assume
as
done
a
deed
which
they
would
recoil
from
doing
and
there
are
other
honest
men
for
whom
morality
ends
at
the
surface
of
their
own
heads
who
will
deliberate
what
the
first
will
not
so
much
as
suppose
barnet
had
a
wife
whose
pretence
distracted
his
home
she
now
lay
as
in
death
by
merely
doing
nothing
by
letting
the
intelligence
which
had
gone
forth
to
the
world
lie
undisturbed
he
would
effect
such
a
deliverance
for
himself
as
he
had
never
hoped
for
and
open
up
an
opportunity
of
which
till
now
he
had
never
dreamed
whether
the
conjuncture
had
arisen
through
any
unscrupulous
impulse
of
charlson
to
help
out
of
a
strait
the
friend
who
was
so
kind
as
never
to
press
him
for
what
was
due
could
not
be
told
there
was
nothing
to
prove
it
and
it
was
a
question
which
could
never
be
asked
the
triangular
situation
himself
his
wife
lucy
savile
was
the
one
clear
thing
from
barnet
actions
we
may
infer
that
he
supposed
such
and
such
a
result
for
a
moment
but
did
not
deliberate
he
withdrew
his
hazel
eyes
from
the
scene
without
calmly
turned
rang
the
bell
for
assistance
and
vigorously
exerted
himself
to
learn
if
life
still
lingered
in
that
motionless
frame
in
a
short
time
another
surgeon
was
in
attendance
and
then
barnet
surmise
proved
to
be
true
the
slow
life
timidly
heaved
again
but
much
care
and
patience
were
needed
to
catch
and
retain
it
and
a
considerable
period
elapsed
before
it
could
be
said
with
certainty
that
barnet
lived
when
this
was
the
case
and
there
was
no
further
room
for
doubt
barnet
left
the
chamber
the
blue
evening
smoke
from
chimney
had
died
down
to
an
imperceptible
stream
and
as
he
walked
about
downstairs
he
murmured
to
himself
wife
was
dead
and
she
is
alive
again
it
was
not
so
with
downe
after
three
hours
immersion
his
wife
body
had
been
recovered
life
of
course
being
quite
extinct
barnet
on
descending
went
straight
to
his
friend
house
and
there
learned
the
result
downe
was
helpless
in
his
wild
grief
occasionally
even
hysterical
barnet
said
little
but
finding
that
some
guiding
hand
was
necessary
in
the
household
took
upon
him
to
supervise
and
manage
till
downe
should
be
in
a
state
of
mind
to
do
so
for
himself
chapter
vi
one
september
evening
four
months
later
when
barnet
was
in
perfect
health
and
downe
but
a
weakening
memory
an
paused
to
rest
himself
in
front
of
barnet
old
house
depositing
his
basket
on
one
of
the
the
street
was
not
yet
lighted
but
there
were
lights
in
the
house
and
at
intervals
a
flitting
shadow
fell
upon
the
blind
at
his
elbow
words
also
were
audible
from
the
same
apartment
and
they
seemed
to
be
those
of
persons
in
violent
altercation
but
the
boy
could
not
gather
their
purport
and
he
went
on
his
way
ten
minutes
afterwards
the
door
of
barnet
house
opened
and
a
tall
lady
in
a
came
out
and
descended
the
freestone
steps
the
servant
stood
in
the
doorway
watching
her
as
she
went
with
a
measured
tread
down
the
street
when
she
had
been
out
of
sight
for
some
minutes
barnet
appeared
at
the
door
from
within
your
mistress
leave
word
where
she
was
going
he
asked
sir
the
carriage
ordered
to
meet
her
anywhere
sir
she
take
a
sir
barnet
went
in
again
sat
down
in
his
chair
and
leaned
back
then
in
solitude
and
silence
he
brooded
over
the
bitter
emotions
that
filled
his
heart
it
was
for
this
that
he
had
gratuitously
restored
her
to
life
and
made
his
union
with
another
impossible
the
evening
drew
on
and
nobody
came
to
disturb
him
at
bedtime
he
told
the
servants
to
retire
that
he
would
sit
up
for
barnet
himself
and
when
they
were
gone
he
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
mused
for
hours
the
clock
struck
one
two
still
his
wife
came
not
and
with
impatience
added
to
depression
he
went
from
room
to
room
till
another
weary
hour
had
passed
this
was
not
altogether
a
new
experience
for
barnet
but
she
had
never
before
so
prolonged
her
absence
at
last
he
sat
down
again
and
fell
asleep
he
awoke
at
six
to
find
that
she
had
not
returned
in
searching
about
the
rooms
he
discovered
that
she
had
taken
a
case
of
jewels
which
had
been
hers
before
her
marriage
at
eight
a
note
was
brought
him
it
was
from
his
wife
in
which
she
stated
that
she
had
gone
by
the
coach
to
the
house
of
a
distant
relative
near
london
and
expressed
a
wish
that
certain
boxes
articles
of
clothing
and
so
on
might
be
sent
to
her
forthwith
the
note
was
brought
to
him
by
a
waiter
at
the
hotel
and
had
been
written
by
barnet
immediately
before
she
took
her
place
in
the
stage
by
the
evening
this
order
was
carried
out
and
barnet
with
a
sense
of
relief
walked
out
into
the
town
a
fair
had
been
held
during
the
day
and
the
large
clear
moon
which
rose
over
the
most
prominent
hill
flung
its
light
upon
the
booths
and
standings
that
still
remained
in
the
street
mixing
its
rays
curiously
with
those
from
the
flaring
naphtha
lamps
the
town
was
full
of
who
had
come
in
to
enjoy
themselves
and
on
this
account
barnet
strolled
through
the
streets
unobserved
with
a
certain
recklessness
he
made
for
the
and
presently
found
himself
by
the
shore
where
he
walked
on
till
he
came
to
the
spot
near
which
his
friend
the
kindly
downe
had
lost
her
life
and
his
own
wife
life
had
been
preserved
a
tremulous
pathway
of
bright
moonshine
now
stretched
over
the
water
which
had
engulfed
them
and
not
a
living
soul
was
near
here
he
ruminated
on
their
characters
and
next
on
the
young
girl
in
whom
he
now
took
a
more
sensitive
interest
than
at
the
time
when
he
had
been
free
to
marry
her
nothing
so
far
as
he
was
aware
had
ever
appeared
in
his
own
conduct
to
show
that
such
an
interest
existed
he
had
made
it
a
point
of
the
utmost
strictness
to
hinder
that
feeling
from
influencing
in
the
faintest
degree
his
attitude
towards
his
wife
and
this
was
made
all
the
more
easy
for
him
by
the
small
demand
barnet
made
upon
his
attentions
for
which
she
ever
evinced
the
greatest
contempt
thus
unwittingly
giving
him
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
their
severance
owed
nothing
to
jealousy
or
indeed
to
any
personal
behaviour
of
his
at
all
her
concern
was
not
with
him
or
his
feelings
as
she
frequently
told
him
but
that
she
had
in
a
moment
of
weakness
thrown
herself
away
upon
a
common
burgher
when
she
might
have
aimed
at
and
possibly
brought
down
a
peer
of
the
realm
her
frequent
depreciation
of
barnet
in
these
terms
had
at
times
been
so
intense
that
he
was
sorely
tempted
to
retaliate
on
her
egotism
by
owning
that
he
loved
at
the
same
low
level
on
which
he
lived
but
prudence
had
prevailed
for
which
he
was
now
thankful
something
seemed
to
sound
upon
the
shingle
behind
him
over
and
above
the
raking
of
the
wave
he
looked
round
and
a
slight
girlish
shape
appeared
quite
close
to
him
he
could
not
see
her
face
because
it
was
in
the
direction
of
the
moon
barnet
the
rambler
said
in
timid
surprise
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
lucy
savile
said
barnet
can
i
repay
you
for
this
pleasure
only
came
because
the
night
was
so
clear
i
am
now
on
my
way
home
am
glad
we
have
met
i
want
to
know
if
you
will
let
me
do
something
for
you
to
give
me
an
occupation
as
an
idle
man
i
am
sure
i
ought
to
help
you
for
i
know
you
are
almost
without
friends
she
hesitated
should
you
tell
me
that
she
said
the
hope
that
you
will
be
frank
with
me
am
not
altogether
without
friends
here
but
i
am
going
to
make
a
little
change
in
my
life
to
go
out
as
a
teacher
of
freehand
drawing
and
practical
perspective
of
course
i
mean
on
a
comparatively
humble
scale
because
i
have
not
been
specially
educated
for
that
profession
but
i
am
sure
i
shall
like
it
much
have
an
opening
have
not
exactly
got
it
but
i
have
advertised
for
one
you
must
let
me
help
you
at
all
need
not
think
it
would
compromise
you
or
that
i
am
indifferent
to
delicacy
i
bear
in
mind
how
we
stand
it
is
very
unlikely
that
you
will
succeed
as
teacher
of
the
class
you
mention
so
let
me
do
something
of
a
different
kind
for
you
say
what
you
would
like
and
it
shall
be
done
if
i
ca
be
a
or
governess
or
something
of
that
sort
i
shall
go
to
india
and
join
my
brother
wish
i
could
go
abroad
anywhere
everywhere
with
you
lucy
and
leave
this
place
and
its
associations
for
ever
she
played
with
the
end
of
her
and
hastily
turned
aside
ever
touch
upon
that
kind
of
topic
again
she
said
with
a
quick
severity
not
free
from
anger
simply
makes
it
impossible
for
me
to
see
you
much
less
receive
any
guidance
from
you
no
thank
you
barnet
you
can
do
nothing
for
me
at
present
and
as
i
suppose
my
uncertainty
will
end
in
my
leaving
for
india
i
fear
you
never
will
if
ever
i
think
you
can
do
anything
i
will
take
the
trouble
to
ask
you
till
then
the
tone
of
her
latter
words
was
equivocal
and
while
he
remained
in
doubt
whether
a
gentle
irony
was
or
was
not
inwrought
with
their
sound
she
swept
lightly
round
and
left
him
alone
he
saw
her
form
get
smaller
and
smaller
along
the
damp
belt
of
between
ebb
and
flood
and
when
she
had
vanished
round
the
cliff
into
the
he
himself
followed
in
the
same
direction
that
her
hopes
from
an
advertisement
should
be
the
single
thread
which
held
lucy
savile
in
england
was
too
much
for
barnet
on
reaching
the
town
he
went
straight
to
the
residence
of
downe
now
a
widower
with
four
children
the
young
motherless
brood
had
been
sent
to
bed
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
earlier
and
when
barnet
entered
he
found
downe
sitting
alone
it
was
the
same
room
as
that
from
which
the
family
had
been
looking
out
for
downe
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
when
downe
had
slipped
into
the
gutter
and
his
wife
had
been
so
enviably
tender
towards
him
the
old
neatness
had
gone
from
the
house
articles
lay
in
places
which
could
show
no
reason
for
their
presence
as
if
momentarily
deposited
there
some
months
ago
and
forgotten
ever
since
there
were
no
flowers
things
were
jumbled
together
on
the
furniture
which
should
have
been
in
cupboards
and
the
place
in
general
had
that
stagnant
unrenovated
air
which
usually
pervades
the
maimed
home
of
the
widower
downe
soon
renewed
his
customary
lament
over
his
wife
and
even
when
he
had
worked
himself
up
to
tears
went
on
volubly
as
if
a
listener
were
a
luxury
to
be
enjoyed
whenever
he
could
be
caught
was
a
treasure
beyond
compare
barnet
i
shall
never
see
such
another
nobody
now
to
nurse
me
nobody
to
console
me
in
those
daily
troubles
you
know
barnet
which
make
consolation
so
necessary
to
a
nature
like
mine
it
would
be
unbecoming
to
repine
for
her
home
was
elsewhere
the
tender
light
in
her
eyes
always
showed
it
but
it
is
a
long
dreary
time
that
i
have
before
me
and
nobody
else
can
ever
fill
the
void
left
in
my
heart
by
her
loss
nobody
nobody
and
downe
wiped
his
eyes
again
was
a
good
woman
in
the
highest
sense
gravely
answered
barnet
who
though
downe
words
drew
genuine
compassion
from
his
heart
could
not
help
feeling
that
a
tender
reticence
would
have
been
a
finer
tribute
to
downe
really
sterling
virtues
than
such
a
lament
as
this
have
something
to
show
you
downe
resumed
producing
from
a
drawer
a
sheet
of
paper
on
which
was
an
elaborate
design
for
a
canopied
tomb
has
been
sent
me
by
the
architect
but
it
is
not
exactly
what
i
want
have
got
jones
to
do
it
i
see
the
man
who
is
carrying
out
my
house
said
barnet
as
he
glanced
at
the
signature
to
the
drawing
but
it
is
not
quite
what
i
want
i
want
something
more
striking
more
like
a
tomb
i
have
seen
in
paul
cathedral
nothing
less
will
do
justice
to
my
feelings
and
how
far
short
of
them
that
will
fall
barnet
privately
thought
the
design
a
sufficiently
imposing
one
as
it
stood
even
extravagantly
ornate
but
feeling
that
he
had
no
right
to
criticize
he
said
gently
should
you
not
live
more
in
your
children
lives
at
the
present
time
and
soften
the
sharpness
of
regret
for
your
own
past
by
thinking
of
their
future
yes
but
what
can
i
do
more
asked
downe
wrinkling
his
forehead
hopelessly
it
was
with
anxious
slowness
that
barnet
produced
his
reply
the
secret
object
of
his
visit
you
not
say
one
day
that
you
ought
by
rights
to
get
a
governess
for
the
children
downe
admitted
that
he
had
said
so
but
that
he
could
not
see
his
way
to
it
kind
of
woman
i
should
like
to
have
he
said
be
rather
beyond
my
means
no
i
think
i
shall
send
them
to
school
in
the
town
when
they
are
old
enough
to
go
out
alone
i
know
of
something
better
than
that
the
late
lieutenant
daughter
lucy
wants
to
do
something
for
herself
in
the
way
of
teaching
she
would
be
inexpensive
and
would
answer
your
purpose
as
well
as
anybody
for
six
or
twelve
months
she
would
probably
come
daily
if
you
were
to
ask
her
and
so
your
housekeeping
arrangements
would
not
be
much
affected
thought
she
had
gone
away
said
the
solicitor
musing
does
she
live
barnet
told
him
and
added
that
if
downe
should
think
of
her
as
suitable
he
would
do
well
to
call
as
soon
as
possible
or
she
might
be
on
the
wing
you
do
see
her
he
said
would
be
advisable
not
to
mention
my
name
she
is
rather
stiff
in
her
ideas
of
me
and
it
might
prejudice
her
against
a
course
if
she
knew
that
i
recommended
it
downe
promised
to
give
the
subject
his
consideration
and
nothing
more
was
said
about
it
just
then
but
when
barnet
rose
to
go
which
was
not
till
nearly
bedtime
he
reminded
downe
of
the
suggestion
and
went
up
the
street
to
his
own
solitary
home
with
a
sense
of
satisfaction
at
his
promising
diplomacy
in
a
charitable
cause
chapter
vii
the
walls
of
his
new
house
were
carried
up
nearly
to
their
full
height
by
a
curious
though
not
infrequent
reaction
barnet
feelings
about
that
unnecessary
structure
had
undergone
a
change
he
took
considerable
interest
in
its
progress
as
a
thing
his
wife
before
her
departure
having
grown
quite
weary
of
it
as
a
hobby
moreover
it
was
an
excellent
distraction
for
a
man
in
the
unhappy
position
of
having
to
live
in
a
provincial
town
with
nothing
to
do
he
was
probably
the
first
of
his
line
who
had
ever
passed
a
day
without
toil
and
perhaps
something
like
an
inherited
instinct
disqualifies
such
men
for
a
life
of
pleasant
inaction
such
as
lies
in
the
power
of
those
whose
leisure
is
not
a
personal
accident
but
a
vast
historical
accretion
which
has
become
part
of
their
natures
thus
barnet
got
into
a
way
of
spending
many
of
his
leisure
hours
on
the
site
of
the
new
building
and
he
might
have
been
seen
on
most
days
at
this
time
trying
the
temper
of
the
mortar
by
punching
the
joints
with
his
stick
looking
at
the
grain
of
a
and
meditating
where
it
grew
or
picturing
under
what
circumstances
the
last
fire
would
be
kindled
in
the
at
present
sootless
chimneys
one
day
when
thus
occupied
he
saw
three
children
pass
by
in
the
company
of
a
fair
young
woman
whose
sudden
appearance
caused
him
to
flush
perceptibly
she
is
there
he
thought
a
blessed
thing
casting
an
interested
glance
over
the
rising
building
and
the
busy
workmen
lucy
savile
and
the
little
downes
passed
by
and
after
that
time
it
became
a
regular
though
almost
unconscious
custom
of
barnet
to
stand
in
the
house
and
look
from
the
ungarnished
windows
at
the
governess
as
she
tripped
towards
the
with
her
young
charges
which
she
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
on
most
fine
afternoons
it
was
on
one
of
these
occasions
when
he
had
been
loitering
on
the
landing
near
the
hole
left
for
the
staircase
not
yet
erected
that
there
appeared
above
the
edge
of
the
floor
a
little
hat
followed
by
a
little
head
barnet
withdrew
through
a
doorway
and
the
child
came
to
the
top
of
the
ladder
stepping
on
to
the
floor
and
crying
to
her
sisters
and
miss
savile
to
follow
another
head
rose
above
the
floor
and
another
and
then
lucy
herself
came
into
view
the
troop
ran
hither
and
thither
through
the
empty
rooms
and
barnet
came
forward
lucy
uttered
a
small
exclamation
she
was
very
sorry
that
she
had
intruded
she
had
not
the
least
idea
that
barnet
was
there
the
children
had
come
up
and
she
had
followed
barnet
replied
that
he
was
only
too
glad
to
see
them
there
now
let
me
show
you
the
rooms
he
said
she
passively
assented
and
he
took
her
round
there
was
not
much
to
show
in
such
a
bare
skeleton
of
a
house
but
he
made
the
most
of
it
and
explained
the
different
ornamental
fittings
that
were
soon
to
be
fixed
here
and
there
lucy
made
but
few
remarks
in
reply
though
she
seemed
pleased
with
her
visit
and
stole
away
down
the
ladder
followed
by
her
companions
after
this
the
new
residence
became
yet
more
of
a
hobby
for
barnet
downe
children
did
not
forget
their
first
visit
and
when
the
windows
were
glazed
and
the
handsome
staircase
spread
its
broad
low
steps
into
the
hall
they
came
again
prancing
in
unwearied
succession
through
every
room
from
to
attics
while
lucy
stood
waiting
for
them
at
the
door
barnet
who
rarely
missed
a
day
in
coming
to
inspect
progress
stepped
out
from
the
could
not
keep
them
out
she
said
with
an
apologetic
blush
tried
to
do
so
very
much
but
they
are
rather
wilful
and
we
are
directed
to
walk
this
way
for
the
sea
air
let
them
make
the
house
their
regular
playground
and
you
yours
said
barnet
is
no
better
place
for
children
to
romp
and
take
their
exercise
in
than
an
empty
house
particularly
in
muddy
or
damp
weather
such
as
we
shall
get
a
good
deal
of
now
and
this
place
will
not
be
furnished
for
a
long
long
time
perhaps
never
i
am
not
at
all
decided
about
it
but
it
must
replied
lucy
looking
round
at
the
hall
rooms
are
excellent
twice
as
high
as
ours
and
the
views
from
the
windows
are
so
lovely
daresay
i
daresay
he
said
absently
all
the
furniture
be
new
she
asked
the
furniture
be
new
that
a
thing
i
have
not
thought
of
in
fact
i
only
come
here
and
look
on
my
father
house
would
have
been
large
enough
for
me
but
another
person
had
a
voice
in
the
matter
and
it
was
settled
that
we
should
build
however
the
place
grows
upon
me
its
recent
associations
are
cheerful
and
i
am
getting
to
like
it
fast
a
certain
uneasiness
in
lucy
manner
showed
that
the
conversation
was
taking
too
personal
a
turn
for
her
as
modern
tastes
develop
people
require
more
room
to
gratify
them
in
she
said
withdrawing
to
call
the
children
and
serenely
bidding
him
good
afternoon
she
went
on
her
way
barnet
life
at
this
period
was
singularly
lonely
and
yet
he
was
happier
than
he
could
have
expected
his
wife
estrangement
and
absence
which
promised
to
be
permanent
left
him
free
as
a
boy
in
his
movements
and
the
solitary
walks
that
he
took
gave
him
ample
opportunity
for
chastened
reflection
on
what
might
have
been
his
lot
if
he
had
only
shown
wisdom
enough
to
claim
lucy
savile
when
there
was
no
bar
between
their
lives
and
she
was
to
be
had
for
the
asking
he
would
occasionally
call
at
the
house
of
his
friend
downe
but
there
was
scarcely
enough
in
common
between
their
two
natures
to
make
them
more
than
friends
of
that
excellent
sort
whose
personal
knowledge
of
each
other
history
and
character
is
always
in
excess
of
intimacy
whereby
they
are
not
so
likely
to
be
severed
by
a
clash
of
sentiment
as
in
cases
where
intimacy
springs
up
in
excess
of
knowledge
lucy
was
never
visible
at
these
times
being
either
engaged
in
the
or
in
taking
an
airing
out
of
doors
but
knowing
that
she
was
now
comfortable
and
had
given
up
the
to
him
depressing
idea
of
going
off
to
the
other
side
of
the
globe
he
was
quite
content
the
new
house
had
so
far
progressed
that
the
gardeners
were
beginning
to
grass
down
the
front
during
an
afternoon
which
he
was
passing
in
marking
the
curve
for
the
he
beheld
her
coming
in
boldly
towards
him
from
the
road
hitherto
barnet
had
only
caught
her
on
the
premises
by
stealth
and
this
advance
seemed
to
show
that
at
last
her
reserve
had
broken
down
a
smile
gained
strength
upon
her
face
as
she
approached
and
it
was
quite
radiant
when
she
came
up
and
said
without
a
trace
of
embarrassment
find
i
owe
you
a
hundred
thanks
and
it
comes
to
me
quite
as
a
surprise
it
was
through
your
kindness
that
i
was
engaged
by
downe
believe
me
barnet
i
did
not
know
it
until
yesterday
or
i
should
have
thanked
you
long
and
long
ago
had
offended
you
just
a
trifle
at
the
time
i
think
said
barnet
smiling
it
was
best
that
you
should
not
know
yes
she
returned
hastily
allude
to
that
it
is
past
and
over
and
we
will
let
it
be
the
house
is
finished
almost
is
it
not
how
beautiful
it
will
look
when
the
evergreens
are
grown
do
you
call
the
style
palladian
mr
barnet
really
do
quite
know
what
it
is
yes
it
must
be
palladian
certainly
but
i
ask
jones
the
architect
for
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
not
thought
much
about
the
style
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
choosing
it
i
am
sorry
to
say
she
would
not
let
him
harp
on
this
gloomy
refrain
and
talked
on
bright
matters
till
she
said
producing
a
small
roll
of
paper
which
he
had
noticed
in
her
hand
all
the
while
downe
wished
me
to
bring
you
this
revised
drawing
of
the
late
downe
tomb
which
the
architect
has
just
sent
him
he
would
like
you
to
look
it
over
the
children
came
up
with
their
hoops
and
she
went
off
with
them
down
the
as
usual
barnet
had
been
glad
to
get
those
words
of
thanks
he
had
been
thinking
for
many
months
that
he
would
like
her
to
know
of
his
share
in
finding
her
a
home
such
as
it
was
and
what
he
could
not
do
for
himself
downe
had
now
kindly
done
for
him
he
returned
to
his
desolate
house
with
a
lighter
tread
though
in
reason
he
hardly
knew
why
his
tread
should
be
light
on
examining
the
drawing
barnet
found
that
instead
of
the
vast
tomb
and
canopy
downe
had
determined
on
at
their
last
meeting
it
was
to
be
a
more
modest
memorial
even
than
had
been
suggested
by
the
architect
a
coped
tomb
of
good
solid
construction
with
no
useless
elaboration
at
all
barnet
was
truly
glad
to
see
that
downe
had
come
to
reason
of
his
own
accord
and
he
returned
the
drawing
with
a
note
of
approval
he
followed
up
the
as
before
and
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
rooms
occasionally
gazing
from
the
windows
over
the
bulging
green
hills
and
the
quiet
harbour
that
lay
between
them
he
murmured
words
and
fragments
of
words
which
if
listened
to
would
have
revealed
all
the
secrets
of
his
existence
whatever
his
reason
in
going
there
lucy
did
not
call
again
the
walk
to
the
shore
seemed
to
be
abandoned
he
must
have
thought
it
as
well
for
both
that
it
should
be
so
for
he
did
not
go
anywhere
out
of
his
accustomed
ways
to
endeavour
to
discover
her
chapter
viii
the
winter
and
the
spring
had
passed
and
the
house
was
complete
it
was
a
fine
morning
in
the
early
part
of
june
and
barnet
though
not
in
the
habit
of
rising
early
had
taken
a
long
walk
before
breakfast
returning
by
way
of
the
new
building
a
sufficiently
exciting
cause
of
his
restlessness
might
have
been
the
intelligence
which
had
reached
him
the
night
before
that
lucy
savile
was
going
to
india
after
all
and
notwithstanding
the
representations
of
her
friends
that
such
a
journey
was
unadvisable
in
many
ways
for
an
unpractised
girl
unless
some
more
definite
advantage
lay
at
the
end
of
it
than
she
could
show
to
be
the
case
barnet
walk
up
the
slope
to
the
building
betrayed
that
he
was
in
a
dissatisfied
mood
he
hardly
saw
that
the
dewy
time
of
day
lent
an
unusual
freshness
to
the
bushes
and
trees
which
had
so
recently
put
on
their
summer
habit
of
heavy
leafage
and
made
his
lawn
look
as
well
established
as
an
old
manorial
meadow
the
house
had
been
so
adroitly
placed
between
six
tall
elms
which
were
growing
on
the
site
beforehand
that
they
seemed
like
real
ancestral
trees
and
the
rooks
young
and
old
cawed
melodiously
to
their
visitor
the
door
was
not
locked
and
he
entered
no
workmen
appeared
to
be
present
and
he
walked
from
sunny
window
to
sunny
window
of
the
empty
rooms
with
a
sense
of
seclusion
which
might
have
been
very
pleasant
but
for
the
antecedent
knowledge
that
his
almost
paternal
care
of
lucy
savile
was
to
be
thrown
away
by
her
wilfulness
footsteps
echoed
through
an
adjoining
room
and
bending
his
eyes
in
that
direction
he
perceived
jones
the
architect
he
had
come
to
look
over
the
building
before
giving
the
contractor
his
final
certificate
they
walked
over
the
house
together
everything
was
finished
except
the
papering
there
were
the
latest
improvements
of
the
period
in
ventilating
jacks
and
french
windows
the
business
was
soon
ended
and
jones
having
directed
barnet
attention
to
a
roll
of
patterns
which
lay
on
a
bench
for
his
choice
was
leaving
to
keep
another
engagement
when
barnet
said
the
tomb
finished
yet
for
mrs
downe
yes
it
is
at
last
said
the
architect
coming
back
and
speaking
as
if
he
were
in
a
mood
to
make
a
confidence
have
had
no
end
of
trouble
in
the
matter
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
am
heartily
glad
it
is
over
barnet
expressed
his
surprise
thought
poor
downe
had
given
up
those
extravagant
notions
of
his
then
he
has
gone
back
to
the
altar
and
canopy
after
all
well
he
is
to
be
excused
poor
fellow
no
he
has
not
at
all
gone
back
to
them
quite
the
reverse
jones
hastened
to
say
has
so
reduced
design
after
design
that
the
whole
thing
has
been
nothing
but
waste
labour
for
me
till
in
the
end
it
has
become
a
common
headstone
which
a
mason
put
up
in
half
a
day
common
headstone
said
barnet
i
held
out
for
some
time
for
the
addition
of
a
footstone
at
least
but
he
said
o
no
he
could
afford
it
well
his
family
is
growing
up
poor
fellow
and
his
expenses
are
getting
serious
exactly
said
jones
as
if
the
subject
were
none
of
his
and
again
directing
barnet
attention
to
the
the
bustling
architect
left
him
to
keep
some
other
engagement
common
headstone
murmured
barnet
left
again
to
himself
he
mused
a
minute
or
two
and
next
began
looking
over
and
selecting
from
the
patterns
but
had
not
long
been
engaged
in
the
work
when
he
heard
another
footstep
on
the
gravel
without
and
somebody
enter
the
open
porch
barnet
went
to
the
door
it
was
his
manservant
in
search
of
him
have
been
trying
for
some
time
to
find
you
sir
he
said
letter
has
come
by
the
post
and
it
is
marked
immediate
and
this
one
from
downe
who
called
just
now
wanting
to
see
you
he
searched
his
pocket
for
the
second
barnet
took
the
first
letter
it
had
a
black
border
and
bore
the
london
postmark
it
was
not
in
his
wife
handwriting
or
in
that
of
any
person
he
knew
but
conjecture
soon
ceased
as
he
read
the
page
wherein
he
was
briefly
informed
that
barnet
had
died
suddenly
on
the
previous
day
at
the
furnished
villa
she
had
occupied
near
london
barnet
looked
vaguely
round
the
empty
hall
at
the
blank
walls
out
of
the
doorway
drawing
a
long
palpitating
breath
and
with
eyes
downcast
he
turned
and
climbed
the
stairs
slowly
like
a
man
who
doubted
their
stability
the
fact
of
his
wife
having
as
it
were
died
once
already
and
lived
on
again
had
entirely
dislodged
the
possibility
of
her
actual
death
from
his
conjecture
he
went
to
the
landing
leant
over
the
balusters
and
after
a
reverie
of
whose
duration
he
had
but
the
faintest
notion
turned
to
the
window
and
stretched
his
gaze
to
the
cottage
further
down
the
road
which
was
visible
from
his
landing
and
from
which
lucy
still
walked
to
the
solicitor
house
by
a
cross
path
the
faint
words
that
came
from
his
moving
lips
were
simply
last
then
almost
involuntarily
barnet
fell
down
on
his
knees
and
murmured
some
incoherent
words
of
thanksgiving
surely
his
virtue
in
restoring
his
wife
to
life
had
been
rewarded
but
as
if
the
impulse
struck
uneasily
on
his
conscience
he
quickly
rose
brushed
the
dust
from
his
trousers
and
set
himself
to
think
of
his
next
movements
he
could
not
start
for
london
for
some
hours
and
as
he
had
no
preparations
to
make
that
could
not
be
made
in
he
mechanically
descended
and
resumed
his
occupation
of
turning
over
the
they
had
all
got
brighter
for
him
those
papers
it
was
all
changed
who
would
sit
in
the
rooms
that
they
were
to
line
he
went
on
to
muse
upon
lucy
conduct
in
so
frequently
coming
to
the
house
with
the
children
her
occasional
blush
in
speaking
to
him
her
evident
interest
in
him
what
woman
can
in
the
long
run
avoid
being
interested
in
a
man
whom
she
knows
to
be
devoted
to
her
if
human
solicitation
could
ever
effect
anything
there
should
be
no
going
to
india
for
lucy
now
all
the
papers
previously
chosen
seemed
wrong
in
their
shades
and
he
began
from
the
beginning
to
choose
again
while
entering
on
the
task
he
heard
a
forced
from
without
the
porch
evidently
uttered
to
attract
his
attention
and
footsteps
again
advancing
to
the
door
his
man
whom
he
had
quite
forgotten
in
his
mental
turmoil
was
still
waiting
there
beg
your
pardon
sir
the
man
said
from
round
the
doorway
here
the
note
from
downe
that
you
did
take
he
called
just
after
you
went
out
and
as
he
could
wait
he
wrote
this
on
your
table
he
handed
in
the
letter
no
one
now
but
a
note
in
the
writing
of
the
solicitor
barnet
it
ran
you
will
be
prepared
for
the
information
i
am
about
to
give
that
lucy
savile
and
myself
are
going
to
be
married
this
morning
i
have
hitherto
said
nothing
as
to
my
intention
to
any
of
my
friends
for
reasons
which
i
am
sure
you
will
fully
appreciate
the
crisis
has
been
brought
about
by
her
expressing
her
intention
to
join
her
brother
in
india
i
then
discovered
that
i
could
not
do
without
her
is
to
be
quite
a
private
wedding
but
it
is
my
particular
wish
that
you
come
down
here
quietly
at
ten
and
go
to
church
with
us
it
will
add
greatly
to
the
pleasure
i
shall
experience
in
the
ceremony
and
i
believe
to
lucy
also
i
have
called
on
you
very
early
to
make
the
request
in
the
belief
that
i
should
find
you
at
home
but
you
are
beforehand
with
me
in
your
early
yours
sincerely
c
downe
i
wait
sir
said
the
servant
after
a
dead
silence
will
do
william
no
answer
said
barnet
calmly
when
the
man
had
gone
barnet
the
letter
turning
eventually
to
the
which
he
had
been
at
such
pains
to
select
he
deliberately
tore
them
into
halves
and
quarters
and
threw
them
into
the
empty
fireplace
then
he
went
out
of
the
house
locked
the
door
and
stood
in
the
front
awhile
instead
of
returning
into
the
town
he
went
down
the
and
thoughtfully
lingered
about
by
the
sea
near
the
spot
where
the
body
of
downe
late
wife
had
been
found
and
brought
ashore
barnet
was
a
man
with
a
rich
capacity
for
misery
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
exercised
it
to
its
fullest
extent
now
the
events
that
had
as
it
were
dashed
themselves
together
into
one
of
this
day
showed
that
curious
refinement
of
cruelty
in
their
arrangement
which
often
proceeds
from
the
bosom
of
the
whimsical
god
at
other
times
known
as
blind
circumstance
that
his
few
minutes
of
hope
between
the
reading
of
the
first
and
second
letters
had
carried
him
to
extraordinary
heights
of
rapture
was
proved
by
the
immensity
of
his
suffering
now
the
sun
blazing
into
his
face
would
have
shown
a
close
watcher
that
a
horizontal
line
which
he
had
never
noticed
before
but
which
was
never
to
be
gone
thereafter
was
somehow
gradually
forming
itself
in
the
smooth
of
his
forehead
his
eyes
of
a
light
hazel
had
a
curious
look
which
can
only
be
described
by
the
word
bruised
the
sorrow
that
looked
from
them
being
largely
mixed
with
the
surprise
of
a
man
taken
unawares
the
secondary
particulars
of
his
present
position
too
were
odd
enough
though
for
some
time
they
appeared
to
engage
little
of
his
attention
not
a
soul
in
the
town
knew
as
yet
of
his
wife
death
and
he
almost
owed
downe
the
kindness
of
not
publishing
it
till
the
day
was
over
the
conjuncture
taken
with
that
which
had
accompanied
the
death
of
downe
being
so
singular
as
to
be
quite
sufficient
to
darken
the
pleasure
of
the
impressionable
solicitor
to
a
cruel
extent
if
made
known
to
him
but
as
barnet
could
not
set
out
on
his
journey
to
london
where
his
wife
lay
for
some
hours
there
being
at
this
date
no
railway
within
a
distance
of
many
miles
no
great
reason
existed
why
he
should
leave
the
town
impulse
in
all
its
forms
characterized
barnet
and
when
he
heard
the
distant
clock
strike
the
hour
of
ten
his
feet
began
to
carry
him
up
the
with
the
manner
of
a
man
who
must
do
something
to
bring
himself
to
life
he
passed
lucy
savile
old
house
his
own
new
one
and
came
in
view
of
the
church
now
he
gave
a
perceptible
start
and
his
mechanical
condition
went
away
before
the
were
a
couple
of
carriages
and
barnet
then
could
perceive
that
the
marriage
between
downe
and
lucy
was
at
that
moment
being
solemnized
within
a
feeling
of
sudden
proud
an
indocile
wish
to
walk
unmoved
in
spite
of
grim
environments
plainly
possessed
him
and
when
he
reached
the
he
turned
in
without
apparent
effort
pacing
up
the
paved
footway
he
entered
the
church
and
stood
for
a
while
in
the
nave
passage
a
group
of
people
was
standing
round
the
vestry
door
barnet
advanced
through
these
and
stepped
into
the
vestry
there
they
were
busily
signing
their
names
seeing
downe
about
to
look
round
barnet
averted
his
somewhat
disturbed
face
for
a
second
or
two
when
he
turned
again
front
to
front
he
was
calm
and
quite
smiling
it
was
a
creditable
triumph
over
himself
and
deserved
to
be
remembered
in
his
native
town
he
greeted
downe
heartily
offering
his
congratulations
it
seemed
as
if
barnet
expected
a
look
upon
lucy
face
but
no
save
the
natural
flush
and
flurry
engendered
by
the
service
just
performed
there
was
nothing
whatever
in
her
bearing
which
showed
a
disturbed
mind
her
eyes
carried
in
them
now
as
at
other
times
the
expression
of
rectitude
which
never
went
so
far
as
to
touch
on
hardness
she
shook
hands
with
him
and
downe
said
warmly
wish
you
could
have
come
sooner
i
called
on
purpose
to
ask
you
you
drive
back
with
us
now
no
said
barnet
am
not
at
all
prepared
but
i
thought
i
would
look
in
upon
you
for
a
moment
even
though
i
had
not
time
to
go
home
and
dress
i
stand
back
and
see
you
pass
out
and
observe
the
effect
of
the
spectacle
upon
myself
as
one
of
the
public
then
lucy
and
her
husband
laughed
and
barnet
laughed
and
retired
and
the
quiet
little
party
went
gliding
down
the
nave
and
towards
the
porch
lucy
new
silk
dress
sweeping
with
a
smart
rustle
round
the
of
the
ancient
font
and
downe
little
daughters
following
in
a
state
of
interest
in
their
position
and
that
of
lucy
their
teacher
and
friend
so
downe
was
comforted
after
his
emily
death
which
had
taken
place
twelve
months
two
weeks
and
three
days
before
that
time
when
the
two
flys
had
driven
off
and
the
spectators
had
vanished
barnet
followed
to
the
door
and
went
out
into
the
sun
he
took
no
more
trouble
to
preserve
a
spruce
exterior
his
step
was
unequal
hesitating
almost
convulsive
and
the
slight
changes
of
colour
which
went
on
in
his
face
seemed
refracted
from
some
inward
flame
in
the
churchyard
he
became
pale
as
a
summer
cloud
and
finding
it
not
easy
to
proceed
he
sat
down
on
one
of
the
tombstones
and
supported
his
head
with
his
hand
hard
by
was
a
sexton
filling
up
a
grave
which
he
had
not
found
time
to
finish
on
the
previous
evening
observing
barnet
he
went
up
to
him
and
recognizing
him
said
i
help
you
home
sir
no
thank
you
said
barnet
rousing
himself
and
standing
up
the
sexton
returned
to
his
grave
followed
by
barnet
who
after
watching
him
awhile
stepped
into
the
grave
now
nearly
filled
and
helped
to
tread
in
the
earth
the
sexton
apparently
thought
his
conduct
a
little
singular
but
he
made
no
observation
and
when
the
grave
was
full
barnet
suddenly
stopped
looked
far
away
and
with
a
decided
step
proceeded
to
the
gate
and
vanished
the
sexton
rested
on
his
shovel
and
looked
after
him
for
a
few
moments
and
then
began
banking
up
the
mound
in
those
short
minutes
of
treading
in
the
dead
man
barnet
had
formed
a
design
but
what
it
was
the
inhabitants
of
that
town
did
not
for
some
long
time
imagine
he
went
home
wrote
several
letters
of
business
called
on
his
lawyer
an
old
man
of
the
same
place
who
had
been
the
legal
adviser
of
barnet
father
before
him
and
during
the
evening
overhauled
a
large
quantity
of
letters
and
other
documents
in
his
possession
by
eleven
the
heap
of
papers
in
and
before
barnet
grate
had
reached
formidable
dimensions
and
he
began
to
burn
them
this
owing
to
their
quantity
it
was
not
so
easy
to
do
as
he
had
expected
and
he
sat
long
into
the
night
to
complete
the
task
the
next
morning
barnet
departed
for
london
leaving
a
note
for
downe
to
inform
him
of
barnet
sudden
death
and
that
he
was
gone
to
bury
her
but
when
a
time
for
that
purpose
had
elapsed
he
was
not
seen
again
in
his
accustomed
walks
or
in
his
new
house
or
in
his
old
one
he
was
gone
for
good
nobody
knew
whither
it
was
soon
discovered
that
he
had
empowered
his
lawyer
to
dispose
of
all
his
property
real
and
personal
in
the
borough
and
pay
in
the
proceeds
to
the
account
of
an
unknown
person
at
one
of
the
large
london
banks
the
person
was
by
some
supposed
to
be
himself
under
an
assumed
name
but
few
if
any
had
certain
knowledge
of
that
fact
the
elegant
new
residence
was
sold
with
the
rest
of
his
possessions
and
its
purchaser
was
no
other
than
downe
now
a
thriving
man
in
the
borough
and
one
whose
growing
family
and
new
wife
required
more
roomy
accommodation
than
was
afforded
by
the
little
house
up
the
narrow
side
street
barnet
old
habitation
was
bought
by
the
trustees
of
the
congregational
baptist
body
in
that
town
who
pulled
down
the
dwelling
and
built
a
new
chapel
on
its
site
by
the
time
the
last
hour
of
that
to
barnet
eventful
year
had
chimed
every
vestige
of

by

friends
during
this
long
interval
george
barnet
had
never
once
been
seen
or
heard
of
in
the
town
of
his
fathers
it
was
the
evening
of
a
and
some
farmers
and
dairymen
were
lounging
round
the
bar
of
the
hotel
occasionally
dropping
a
remark
to
each
other
and
less
frequently
to
the
two
barmaids
who
stood
within
the
counter
in
a
perfunctory
attitude
of
attention
these
latter
sighing
and
making
a
private
observation
to
one
another
at
odd
intervals
on
more
interesting
experiences
than
the
present
get
shorter
said
one
of
the
dairymen
as
he
looked
towards
the
street
and
noticed
that
the
was
passing
by
the
farmers
merely
acknowledged
by
their
countenances
the
propriety
of
this
remark
and
finding
that
nobody
else
spoke
one
of
the
barmaids
said
in
a
tone
of
painful
duty
we
shall
have
to
light
up
before
we
start
for
true
his
neighbour
conceded
with
a
gaze
of
blankness
after
that
we
sha
see
much
further
difference
all
winter
the
rest
were
not
unwilling
to
go
even
so
far
as
this
the
barmaid
sighed
again
and
raised
one
of
her
hands
from
the
counter
on
which
they
rested
to
scratch
the
smallest
surface
of
her
face
with
the
smallest
of
her
fingers
she
looked
towards
the
door
and
presently
remarked
think
i
hear
the
coming
in
from
station
the
eyes
of
the
dairymen
and
farmers
turned
to
the
glass
door
dividing
the
hall
from
the
porch
and
in
a
minute
or
two
the
omnibus
drew
up
outside
then
there
was
a
lumbering
down
of
luggage
and
then
a
man
came
into
the
hall
followed
by
a
porter
with
a
portmanteau
on
his
poll
which
he
deposited
on
a
bench
the
stranger
was
an
elderly
person
with
curly
ashen
white
hair
a
creviced
outer
corner
to
each
eyelid
and
a
countenance
baked
by
innumerable
suns
to
the
colour
of
its
hue
and
that
of
his
hair
contrasting
like
heat
and
cold
respectively
he
walked
meditatively
and
gently
like
one
who
was
fearful
of
disturbing
his
own
mental
equilibrium
but
whatever
lay
at
the
bottom
of
his
breast
had
evidently
made
him
so
accustomed
to
its
situation
there
that
it
caused
him
little
practical
inconvenience
he
paused
in
silence
while
with
his
dubious
eyes
fixed
on
the
barmaids
he
seemed
to
consider
himself
in
a
moment
or
two
he
addressed
them
and
asked
to
be
accommodated
for
the
night
as
he
waited
he
looked
curiously
round
the
hall
but
said
nothing
as
soon
as
invited
he
disappeared
up
the
staircase
preceded
by
a
chambermaid
and
candle
and
followed
by
a
lad
with
his
trunk
not
a
soul
had
recognized
him
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
when
the
farmers
and
dairymen
had
driven
off
to
their
homesteads
in
the
country
he
came
downstairs
took
a
biscuit
and
one
glass
of
wine
and
walked
out
into
the
town
where
the
radiance
from
the
had
grown
so
in
volume
of
late
years
as
to
flood
with
cheerfulness
every
standing
cart
barrow
stall
and
idler
that
occupied
the
wayside
whether
shabby
or
genteel
his
chief
interest
at
present
seemed
to
lie
in
the
names
painted
over
the
and
on
as
far
as
they
were
visible
these
now
differed
to
an
ominous
extent
from
what
they
had
been
years
before
the
traveller
passed
on
till
he
came
to
the
bookseller
where
he
looked
in
through
the
glass
door
a
young
man
was
standing
behind
the
counter
otherwise
the
shop
was
empty
the
observer
entered
asked
for
some
periodical
by
way
of
paying
for
admission
and
with
his
elbow
on
the
counter
began
to
turn
over
the
pages
he
had
bought
though
that
he
read
nothing
was
obvious
at
length
he
said
old
watkins
still
alive
in
a
voice
which
had
a
curious
youthful
cadence
in
it
even
now
father
is
dead
sir
said
the
young
man
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
said
the
stranger
it
is
so
many
years
since
i
last
visited
this
town
that
i
could
hardly
expect
it
should
be
otherwise
after
a
short
silence
he
continued
is
the
firm
of
barnet
browse
and
company
still
in
existence
they
used
to
be
large
and
here
firm
is
still
going
on
sir
but
they
have
dropped
the
name
of
barnet
i
believe
that
was
a
sort
of
fancy
name
at
least
i
never
knew
of
any
living
barnet
is
now
browse
and
does
andrew
jones
still
keep
on
as
architect
dead
sir
the
vicar
of
mary
mr
melrose
been
dead
a
great
many
years
me
he
paused
yet
longer
and
cleared
his
voice
downe
the
solicitor
still
in
practice
sir
he
dead
he
died
about
seven
years
ago
here
it
was
a
longer
silence
still
and
an
attentive
observer
would
have
noticed
that
the
paper
in
the
stranger
hand
increased
its
imperceptible
tremor
to
a
visible
shake
that
gentleman
noticed
it
himself
and
rested
the
paper
on
the
counter
downe
still
alive
he
asked
closing
his
lips
firmly
as
soon
as
the
words
were
out
of
his
mouth
and
dropping
his
eyes
sir
she
alive
and
well
she
living
at
the
old
place
east
street
no
at
chateau
ringdale
i
believe
it
has
been
in
the
family
for
some
generations
lives
with
her
children
perhaps
she
has
no
children
of
her
own
there
were
some
miss
downes
i
think
they
were
downe
daughters
by
a
former
wife
but
they
are
married
and
living
in
other
parts
of
the
town
downe
lives
alone
alone
sir
quite
alone
the
gentleman
went
back
to
the
hotel
and
dined
after
which
he
made
some
change
in
his
dress
shaved
back
his
beard
to
the
fashion
that
had
prevailed
twenty
years
earlier
when
he
was
young
and
interesting
and
once
more
emerging
bent
his
steps
in
the
direction
of
the
just
before
getting
to
the
point
where
the
pavement
ceased
and
the
houses
isolated
themselves
he
overtook
a
shambling
stooping
unshaven
man
who
at
first
sight
appeared
like
a
professional
tramp
his
shoulders
having
a
perceptible
greasiness
as
they
passed
under
the
gaslight
each
pedestrian
momentarily
turned
and
regarded
the
other
and
the
gentleman
started
back
why
is
that
barnet
is
barnet
surely
and
you
are
charlson
ah
you
notice
my
appearance
the
fates
have
rather
me
that
fifty
pounds
i
never
paid
it
did
i
but
i
was
not
ungrateful
here
the
stooping
man
laid
one
hand
emphatically
on
the
palm
of
the
other
gave
you
a
chance
george
barnet
which
many
men
would
have
thought
full
value
received
the
chance
to
marry
your
lucy
as
far
as
the
world
was
concerned
your
wife
was
a
drowned
woman
hey
forbid
all
that
charlson
well
was
a
wrong
way
of
showing
gratitude
i
suppose
and
now
a
drop
of
something
to
drink
for
old
acquaintance
sake
and
barnet
she
again
free
there
a
chance
now
if
you
care
for
it
ha
ha
and
the
speaker
pushed
his
tongue
into
his
hollow
cheek
and
slanted
his
eye
in
the
old
fashion
know
all
said
barnet
quickly
and
slipping
a
small
present
into
the
hands
of
the
needy
saddening
man
he
stepped
ahead
and
was
soon
in
the
outskirts
of
the
town
he
reached
the
and
paused
before
the
entrance
to
a
known
house
it
was
so
highly
bosomed
in
trees
and
shrubs
planted
since
the
erection
of
the
building
that
one
would
scarcely
have
recognized
the
spot
as
that
which
had
been
a
mere
neglected
slope
till
chosen
as
a
site
for
a
dwelling
he
opened
the
closed
it
noiselessly
and
gently
moved
into
the
semicircular
drive
which
remained
exactly
as
it
had
been
marked
out
by
barnet
on
the
morning
when
lucy
savile
ran
in
to
thank
him
for
procuring
her
the
post
of
governess
to
downe
children
but
the
growth
of
trees
and
bushes
which
revealed
itself
at
every
step
was
beyond
all
expectation
and
bowers
vaulted
the
walks
and
the
walls
of
the
house
were
uniformly
bearded
with
creeping
plants
as
high
as
the
windows
after
lingering
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
dusk
of
the
bending
boughs
the
visitor
rang
the
and
on
the
servant
appearing
he
announced
himself
as
old
friend
of
mrs
downe
the
hall
was
lighted
but
not
brightly
the
gas
being
turned
low
as
if
visitors
were
rare
there
was
a
stagnation
in
the
dwelling
it
seemed
to
be
waiting
could
it
really
be
waiting
for
him
the
partitions
which
had
been
probed
by
barnet
when
the
mortar
was
green
were
now
quite
brown
with
the
antiquity
of
their
varnish
and
the
ornamental
woodwork
of
the
staircase
which
had
glistened
with
a
pale
yellow
newness
when
first
erected
was
now
of
a
rich
during
the
absence
the
following
colloquy
could
be
dimly
heard
through
the
nearly
closed
door
of
the
did
give
his
name
only
said
an
old
friend
kind
of
gentleman
is
he
staidish
gentleman
with
gray
hair
the
voice
of
the
second
speaker
seemed
to
affect
the
listener
greatly
after
a
pause
the
lady
said
well
i
will
see
him
and
the
stranger
was
shown
in
face
to
face
with
the
lucy
who
had
once
been
lucy
savile
the
round
cheek
of
that
formerly
young
lady
had
of
course
alarmingly
flattened
its
curve
in
her
modern
representative
a
pervasive
grayness
overspread
her
once
dark
brown
hair
like
morning
rime
on
heather
the
parting
down
the
middle
was
wide
and
jagged
once
it
had
been
a
thin
white
line
a
narrow
crevice
between
two
high
banks
of
shade
but
there
was
still
enough
left
to
form
a
handsome
knob
behind
and
some
curls
beneath
inwrought
with
a
few
hairs
like
silver
wires
were
very
becoming
in
her
eyes
the
only
modification
was
that
their
originally
mild
rectitude
of
expression
had
become
a
little
more
stringent
than
heretofore
yet
she
was
still
girlish
a
girl
who
had
been
gratuitously
weighted
by
destiny
with
a
burden
of
years
instead
of
her
proper
twenty
do
you
know
me
he
said
when
the
servant
had
closed
the
door
knew
you
the
instant
i
saw
you
she
returned
cheerfully
know
why
but
i
always
thought
you
would
come
back
to
your
old
town
again
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
then
they
sat
down
said
you
were
dead
continued
lucy
i
never
thought
so
we
should
have
heard
of
it
for
certain
if
you
had
been
is
a
very
long
time
since
we
met
what
you
must
have
seen
barnet
in
all
these
roving
years
in
comparison
with
what
i
have
seen
in
this
quiet
place
her
face
grew
more
serious
know
my
husband
has
been
dead
a
long
time
i
am
a
lonely
old
woman
now
considering
what
i
have
been
though
daughters
all
married
manage
to
keep
me
pretty
cheerful
i
am
a
lonely
old
man
and
have
been
any
time
these
twenty
years
where
have
you
kept
yourself
and
why
did
you
go
off
so
mysteriously
lucy
i
have
kept
myself
a
little
in
america
and
a
little
in
australia
a
little
in
india
a
little
at
the
cape
and
so
on
i
have
not
stayed
in
any
place
for
a
long
time
as
it
seems
to
me
and
yet
more
than
twenty
years
have
flown
but
when
people
get
to
my
age
two
years
go
like
one
your
second
question
why
did
i
go
away
so
mysteriously
is
surely
not
necessary
you
guessed
why
did
you
i
never
once
guessed
she
said
simply
did
charles
nor
did
anybody
as
far
as
i
know
indeed
now
think
it
over
again
and
then
look
at
me
and
say
if
you
ca
guess
she
looked
him
in
the
face
with
an
inquiring
smile
not
because
of
me
she
said
pausing
at
the
commencement
of
surprise
barnet
nodded
and
smiled
again
but
his
smile
was
sadder
than
hers
i
married
charles
she
asked
solely
because
you
married
him
on
the
day
i
was
free
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
my
wife
died
hours
before
you
went
to
church
with
downe
the
fixing
of
my
journey
at
that
particular
moment
was
because
of
her
funeral
but
once
away
i
knew
i
should
have
no
inducement
to
come
back
and
took
my
steps
accordingly
her
face
assumed
an
aspect
of
gentle
reflection
and
she
looked
up
and
down
his
form
with
great
interest
in
her
eyes
never
thought
of
it
she
said
knew
of
course
that
you
had
once
implied
some
warmth
of
feeling
towards
me
but
i
concluded
that
it
passed
off
and
i
have
always
been
under
the
impression
that
your
wife
was
alive
at
the
time
of
my
marriage
was
it
not
stupid
of
me
but
you
will
have
some
tea
or
something
i
have
never
dined
late
you
know
since
my
husband
death
i
have
got
into
the
way
of
making
a
regular
meal
of
tea
you
will
have
some
tea
with
me
will
you
not
the
travelled
man
assented
quite
readily
and
tea
was
brought
in
they
sat
and
chatted
over
the
meal
regardless
of
the
flying
hour
well
said
barnet
presently
as
for
the
first
time
he
leisurely
surveyed
the
room
like
it
all
is
and
yet
how
different
just
where
your
piano
stands
was
a
board
on
a
couple
of
trestles
bearing
the
patterns
of
when
i
was
last
here
i
was
choosing
them
standing
in
this
way
as
it
might
be
then
my
servant
came
in
at
the
door
and
handed
me
a
note
so
it
was
from
downe
and
announced
that
you
were
just
going
to
be
married
to
him
i
chose
no
more
tore
up
all
those
i
had
selected
and
left
the
house
i
never
entered
it
again
till
now
at
last
i
understand
it
all
she
murmured
they
had
both
risen
and
gone
to
the
fireplace
the
mantel
came
almost
on
a
level
with
her
shoulder
which
gently
rested
against
it
and
barnet
laid
his
hand
upon
the
shelf
close
beside
her
shoulder
he
said
late
than
never
will
you
marry
me
now
she
started
back
and
the
surprise
which
was
so
obvious
in
her
wrought
even
greater
surprise
in
him
that
it
should
be
so
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
she
had
been
quite
blind
to
the
situation
and
yet
all
reason
and
common
sense
went
to
prove
that
she
was
not
acting
take
me
quite
unawares
by
such
a
question
she
said
with
a
forced
laugh
of
uneasiness
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
shown
any
embarrassment
at
all
she
added
could
marry
you
for
the
world
after
all
this
why
not
is
i
would
i
really
think
i
may
say
it
i
would
upon
the
whole
rather
marry
you
barnet
than
any
other
man
i
have
ever
met
if
i
ever
dreamed
of
marriage
again
but
i
do
dream
of
it
it
is
quite
out
of
my
thoughts
i
have
not
the
least
intention
of
marrying
again
on
my
account
could
you
alter
your
plans
a
little
come
barnet
she
said
with
a
little
flutter
would
on
your
account
if
on
anybody
in
existence
but
you
do
know
in
the
least
what
it
is
you
are
asking
such
an
impracticable
thing
i
wo
say
ridiculous
of
course
because
i
see
that
you
are
really
in
earnest
and
earnestness
is
never
ridiculous
to
my
mind
yes
said
barnet
more
slowly
dropping
her
hand
which
he
had
taken
at
the
moment
of
pleading
am
in
earnest
the
resolve
two
months
ago
at
the
cape
to
come
back
once
more
was
it
is
true
rather
sudden
and
as
i
see
now
not
well
considered
but
i
am
in
earnest
in
asking
i
in
declining
with
all
good
feeling
and
all
kindness
let
me
say
that
i
am
quite
opposed
to
the
idea
of
marrying
a
second
time
no
harm
has
been
done
he
answered
with
the
same
subdued
and
tender
humorousness
that
he
had
shown
on
such
occasions
in
early
life
you
really
wo
accept
me
i
must
put
up
with
it
i
suppose
his
eye
fell
on
the
clock
as
he
spoke
you
any
notion
that
it
was
so
late
he
asked
absorbed
i
have
been
she
accompanied
him
to
the
hall
helped
him
to
put
on
his
overcoat
and
let
him
out
of
the
house
herself
said
barnet
on
the
doorstep
as
the
lamp
shone
in
his
face
are
not
offended
with
me
not
nor
you
with
me
consider
whether
i
am
or
not
he
pleasantly
replied
she
watched
him
safely
through
the
gate
and
when
his
footsteps
had
died
away
upon
the
road
closed
the
door
softly
and
returned
to
the
room
here
the
modest
widow
long
pondered
his
speeches
with
eyes
dropped
to
an
unusually
low
level
barnet
urbanity
under
the
blow
of
her
refusal
greatly
impressed
her
after
having
his
long
period
of
probation
rendered
useless
by
her
decision
he
had
shown
no
anger
and
had
philosophically
taken
her
words
as
if
he
deserved
no
better
ones
it
was
very
gentlemanly
of
him
certainly
it
was
more
than
gentlemanly
it
was
heroic
and
grand
the
more
she
meditated
the
more
she
questioned
the
virtue
of
her
conduct
in
checking
him
so
peremptorily
and
went
to
her
bedroom
in
a
mood
of
dissatisfaction
on
looking
in
the
glass
she
was
reminded
that
there
was
not
so
much
remaining
of
her
former
beauty
as
to
make
his
frank
declaration
an
impulsive
natural
homage
to
her
cheeks
and
eyes
it
must
undoubtedly
have
arisen
from
an
old
staunch
feeling
of
his
deserving
tenderest
consideration
she
recalled
to
her
mind
with
much
pleasure
that
he
had
told
her
he
was
staying
at
the
hotel
so
that
if
after
waiting
a
day
or
two
he
should
not
in
his
modesty
call
again
she
might
then
send
him
a
nice
little
note
to
alter
her
views
for
the
present
was
far
from
her
intention
but
she
would
allow
herself
to
be
induced
to
reconsider
the
case
as
any
generous
woman
ought
to
do
the
morrow
came
and
passed
and
barnet
did
not
drop
in
at
every
knock
light
youthful
hues
flew
across
her
cheek
and
she
was
abstracted
in
the
presence
of
her
other
visitors
in
the
evening
she
walked
about
the
house
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
herself
the
conditions
of
existence
seemed
totally
different
from
those
which
ruled
only
twenty
short
hours
ago
what
had
been
at
first
a
tantalizing
elusive
sentiment
was
getting
acclimatized
within
her
as
a
definite
hope
and
her
person
was
so
informed
by
that
emotion
that
she
might
almost
have
stood
as
its
emblematical
representative
by
the
time
the
clock
struck
ten
in
short
an
interest
in
barnet
precisely
resembling
that
of
her
early
youth
led
her
present
heart
to
belie
her
yesterday
words
to
him
and
she
longed
to
see
him
again
the
next
day
she
walked
out
early
thinking
she
might
meet
him
in
the
street
the
growing
beauty
of
her
romance
absorbed
her
and
she
went
from
the
street
to
the
fields
and
from
the
fields
to
the
shore
without
any
consciousness
of
distance
till
reminded
by
her
weariness
that
she
could
go
no
further
he
had
nowhere
appeared
in
the
evening
she
took
a
step
which
under
the
circumstances
seemed
justifiable
she
wrote
a
note
to
him
at
the
hotel
inviting
him
to
tea
with
her
at
six
precisely
and
signing
her
note
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
messenger
came
back
barnet
had
left
the
hotel
early
in
the
morning
of
the
day
before
but
he
had
stated
that
he
would
probably
return
in
the
course
of
the
week
the
note
was
sent
back
to
be
given
to
him
immediately
on
his
arrival
there
was
no
sign
from
the
inn
that
this
desired
event
had
occurred
either
on
the
next
day
or
the
day
following
on
both
nights
she
had
been
restless
and
had
scarcely
slept
on
the
saturday
putting
off
all
diffidence
lucy
went
herself
to
the
and
questioned
the
staff
closely
barnet
had
cursorily
remarked
when
leaving
that
he
might
return
on
the
thursday
or
friday
but
they
were
directed
not
to
reserve
a
room
for
him
unless
he
should
write
he
had
left
no
address
lucy
sorrowfully
took
back
her
note
went
home
and
resolved
to
wait
she
did
wait
years
and
years
but
barnet
never
reappeared
april
interlopers
at
the
knap
chapter
i
the
north
road
from
casterbridge
is
tedious
and
lonely
especially
in
along
a
part
of
its
course
it
connects
with
lane
a
monotonous
track
without
a
village
or
hamlet
for
many
miles
and
with
very
seldom
a
turning
unapprized
wayfarers
who
are
too
old
or
too
young
or
in
other
respects
too
weak
for
the
distance
to
be
traversed
but
who
nevertheless
have
to
walk
it
say
as
they
look
wistfully
ahead
at
the
top
of
that
hill
and
i
must
surely
see
the
end
of
lane
but
they
reach
the
hilltop
and
lane
stretches
in
front
as
mercilessly
as
before
some
few
years
ago
a
certain
farmer
was
riding
through
this
lane
in
the
gloom
of
a
winter
evening
the
farmer
friend
a
dairyman
was
riding
beside
him
a
few
paces
in
the
rear
rode
the
farmer
man
all
three
were
well
horsed
on
strong
cobs
and
to
be
well
horsed
was
to
be
in
better
spirits
about
lane
than
poor
pedestrians
could
attain
to
during
its
passage
but
the
farmer
did
not
talk
much
to
his
friend
as
he
rode
along
the
enterprise
which
had
brought
him
there
filled
his
mind
for
in
truth
it
was
important
not
altogether
so
important
was
it
perhaps
when
estimated
by
its
value
to
society
at
large
but
if
the
true
measure
of
a
deed
be
proportionate
to
the
space
it
occupies
in
the
heart
of
him
who
undertakes
it
farmer
charles
darton
business
could
hold
its
own
with
the
business
of
kings
he
was
a
large
farmer
his
turnover
as
it
is
called
was
probably
thirty
thousand
pounds
a
year
he
had
a
great
many
draught
horses
a
great
many
milch
cows
and
of
sheep
a
multitude
this
comfortable
position
was
however
none
of
his
own
making
it
had
been
created
by
his
father
a
man
of
a
very
different
stamp
from
the
present
representative
of
the
line
darton
the
father
had
been
a
character
with
a
pocket
and
a
eye
brimming
with
commercial
subtlety
in
darton
the
son
this
trade
subtlety
had
become
transmuted
into
emotional
and
the
harshness
had
disappeared
he
would
have
been
called
a
sad
man
but
for
his
constant
care
not
to
divide
himself
from
lively
friends
by
piping
notes
out
of
harmony
with
theirs
contemplative
he
allowed
his
mind
to
be
a
quiet
for
memories
and
hopes
so
that
naturally
enough
since
succeeding
to
the
agricultural
calling
and
up
to
his
present
age
of
he
had
neither
advanced
nor
receded
as
a
capitalist
a
stationary
result
which
did
not
agitate
one
of
his
unambitious
unstrategic
nature
since
he
had
all
that
he
desired
the
motive
of
his
expedition
showed
the
same
absence
of
anxious
regard
for
number
one
the
party
rode
on
in
the
slow
safe
trot
proper
to
and
bad
roads
farmer
darton
head
jigging
rather
unromantically
up
and
down
against
the
sky
and
his
motions
being
repeated
with
bolder
emphasis
by
his
friend
japheth
johns
while
those
of
the
latter
were
travestied
in
jerks
still
less
softened
by
art
in
the
person
of
the
lad
who
attended
them
a
pair
of
whitish
objects
hung
one
on
each
side
of
the
latter
bumping
against
him
at
each
step
and
still
further
spoiling
the
grace
of
his
seat
on
close
inspection
they
might
have
been
perceived
to
be
open
rush
baskets
one
containing
a
turkey
and
the
other
some
bottles
of
wine
d
feel
ye
can
meet
your
fate
like
a
man
neighbour
darton
asked
johns
breaking
a
silence
which
had
lasted
while
hedgerow
trees
had
glided
by
darton
with
a
murmured
call
it
my
fate
hanging
and
wiving
go
by
destiny
and
then
they
were
silent
again
the
darkness
thickened
rapidly
at
intervals
shutting
down
on
the
land
in
a
perceptible
flap
like
the
wave
of
a
wing
the
customary
close
of
day
was
accelerated
by
a
simultaneous
blurring
of
the
air
with
the
fall
of
night
had
come
a
mist
just
damp
enough
to
incommode
but
not
sufficient
to
saturate
them
countrymen
as
they
were
born
as
may
be
said
with
only
an
open
door
between
them
and
the
four
seasons
they
regarded
the
mist
but
as
an
added
obscuration
and
ignored
its
humid
quality
they
were
travelling
in
a
direction
that
was
enlivened
by
no
modern
current
of
traffic
the
place
of
darton
pilgrimage
being
an
village
one
of
the
hintocks
several
villages
of
that
name
with
a
distinctive
prefix
or
affix
lying
thereabout
where
the
people
make
the
best
cider
and
in
all
wessex
and
where
the
dunghills
smell
of
pomace
instead
of
stable
refuse
as
elsewhere
the
lane
was
sometimes
so
narrow
that
the
brambles
of
the
hedge
which
hung
forward
like
anglers
rods
over
a
stream
scratched
their
hats
and
combed
their
whiskers
as
they
passed
yet
this
neglected
lane
had
been
a
highway
to
queen
elizabeth
subjects
and
the
cavalcades
of
the
past
its
day
was
over
now
and
its
history
as
a
national
artery
done
for
ever
i
have
decided
to
marry
her
resumed
darton
in
a
measured
musical
voice
of
confidence
which
revealed
a
good
deal
of
his
composition
as
he
glanced
round
to
see
that
the
lad
was
not
too
near
not
only
that
i
like
her
but
that
i
can
do
no
better
even
from
a
fairly
practical
point
of
view
that
i
might
ha
looked
higher
is
possibly
true
though
it
is
really
all
nonsense
i
have
had
experience
enough
in
looking
above
me
no
more
superior
women
for
me
said
i
you
know
when
sally
is
a
comely
independent
simple
character
with
no
about
her
think
me
as
much
a
superior
to
her
as
i
used
to
think
you
know
who
i
mean
was
to
me
said
johns
i
should
call
sally
hall
simple
primary
because
no
sally
is
secondary
because
if
some
could
be
this
one
would
is
a
wrong
denomination
to
apply
to
a
woman
charles
and
affects
me
as
your
best
man
like
cold
water
is
like
recommending
a
stage
play
by
saying
there
neither
murder
villainy
nor
harm
of
any
sort
in
it
when
that
what
you
paid
your
to
see
may
your
opinion
do
you
good
mine
a
different
one
and
turning
the
conversation
from
the
philosophical
to
the
practical
darton
expressed
a
hope
that
the
said
sally
had
received
what
he
sent
on
by
the
carrier
that
day
johns
wanted
to
know
what
that
was
is
a
dress
said
darton
exactly
a
though
she
may
use
it
as
one
if
she
likes
it
is
rather
serviceable
than
showy
suitable
for
the
winter
weather
said
johns
is
a
wise
word
in
a
bridegroom
i
commend
ye
charles
said
darton
should
a
woman
dress
up
like
a
because
she
going
to
do
the
most
solemn
deed
of
her
life
except
dying
why
but
she
will
because
she
will
i
suppose
said
dairyman
johns
said
darton
the
lane
they
followed
had
been
nearly
straight
for
several
miles
but
it
now
took
a
turn
and
winding
uncertainly
for
some
distance
forked
into
two
by
night
country
roads
are
apt
to
reveal
ungainly
qualities
which
pass
without
observation
during
day
and
though
darton
had
travelled
this
way
before
he
had
not
done
so
frequently
sally
having
been
wooed
at
the
house
of
a
relative
near
his
own
he
never
remembered
seeing
at
this
spot
a
pair
of
alternative
ways
looking
so
equally
probable
as
these
two
did
now
johns
rode
on
a
few
steps
be
out
of
heart
sonny
he
cried
a
handpost
enoch
come
and
climm
this
post
and
tell
us
the
way
the
lad
dismounted
and
jumped
into
the
hedge
where
the
post
stood
under
a
tree
the
baskets
or
you
smash
up
that
wine
cried
darton
as
the
young
man
began
spasmodically
to
climb
the
post
baskets
and
all
there
ever
less
head
in
a
brainless
world
said
johns
simple
nocky
i
do
it
he
leapt
off
and
with
much
puffing
climbed
the
post
striking
a
match
when
he
reached
the
top
and
moving
the
light
along
the
arm
the
lad
standing
and
gazing
at
the
spectacle
have
faced
tantalization
these
twenty
years
with
a
temper
as
mild
as
milk
said
japheth
such
things
as
this
do
come
short
of
devilry
and
flinging
the
match
away
he
slipped
down
to
the
ground
the
matter
asked
darton
a
letter
sacred
or
heathen
not
so
much
as
would
tell
us
the
way
to
the
great
fireplace
ever
i
should
sin
to
say
it
either
the
moss
and
mildew
have
eat
away
the
words
or
we
have
arrived
in
a
land
where
the
natyves
have
lost
the
art
o
writing
and
should
ha
brought
our
compass
like
christopher
columbus
us
take
the
straightest
road
said
darton
placidly
sha
be
sorry
to
get
there
is
a
tiresome
ride
i
would
have
driven
if
i
had
known
i
neither

said
enoch
straps
plough
my

zull
if
is
much
further
to
your

maister
darton
i
shall
ask

carry
half
of
these
good
things
in
my
innerds
hee
hee
you
be
such
a
reforming
radical
enoch
said
johns
sternly
i
take
the
turkey
this
being
done
they
went
forward
by
the
lane
which
ascended
a
hill
the
left
winding
away
under
a
plantation
the
of
their
horses
hoofs
lessened
up
the
slope
and
the
ironical
stood
in
solitude
as
before
holding
out
its
blank
arms
to
the
raw
breeze
which
brought
a
snore
from
the
wood
as
if

giant
were
sleeping
there
chapter
ii
three
miles
to
the
left
of
the
travellers
along
the
road
they
had
not
followed
rose
an
old
house
with
mullioned
windows
of
stone
and
chimneys
of
lavish
solidity
it
stood
at
the
top
of
a
slope
beside
and
immediately
in
front
of
it
grew
a
large
whose
bared
roots
formed
a
convenient
staircase
from
the
road
below
to
the
front
door
of
the
dwelling
its
situation
gave
the
house
what
little
distinctive
name
it
possessed
namely
knap
some
forty
yards
off
a
brook
dribbled
past
which
for
its
size
made
a
great
deal
of
noise
at
the
back
was
a
dairy
barton
accessible
for
vehicles
and
by
a
side
thus
much
only
of
the
character
of
the
homestead
could
be
divined
out
of
doors
at
this
shady
but
within
there
was
plenty
of
light
to
see
by
as
plenty

construed

hintock
beside
a
tudor
fireplace
whose

part
of
the
world
where
the
latter
modification
had
not
as
yet
been
effaced
as
a
vulgarity
by
the
march
of
intellect
the
owner
of
the
name
was
the
young
woman
by
whose
means
darton
proposed
to
put
an
end
to
his
bachelor
condition
on
the
approaching
day
the
mother
bereavement
had
been
so
long
ago
as
not
to
leave
much
mark
of
its
occurrence
upon
her
now
either
in
face
or
clothes
she
had
resumed
the
of
her
early
married
life
enlivening
its
whiteness
by
a
few
ribbons
sally
required
no
such
aids
to
pinkness
roseate
lit
up
her
gaze
her
features
showed
curves
of
decision
and
judgment
and
she
might
have
been
regarded
without
much
mistake
as
a
handsome
girl
she
did
most
of
the
talking
her
mother
listening
with
a
air
as
she
picked
up
fragments
of
wood
ember
with
the
tongs
and
piled
them
upon
the
brands
but
the
number
of
speeches
that
passed
was
very
small
in
proportion
to
the
meanings
exchanged
long
experience
together
often
enabled
them
to
see
the
course
of
thought
in
each
minds
without
a
word
being
spoken
behind
them
in
the
centre
of
the
room
the
table
was
spread
for
supper
certain
whiffs
of
air
laden
with
fat
vapours
which
ever
and
anon
entered
from
the
kitchen
denoting
its
preparation
there
new
gown
he
was
going
to
send
you
stays
about
on
the
way
like
himself
sally
mother
was
saying
not
finished
i
daresay
cried
sally
independently
i
should
be
amazed
if
it
did
come
at
all
young
men
make
such
kind
promises
when
they
are
near
you
and
forget
when
they
go
away
but
he
does
intend
it
as
a
he
gives
it
to
me
merely
as
a
gown
to
wear
when
i
like
a
is
what
it
would
be
called
by
some
come
rathe
or
come
late
it
do
much
matter
as
i
have
a
dress
of
my
own
to
fall
back
upon
but
what
time
is
it
she
went
to
the
family
clock
and
opened
the
glass
for
the
hour
was
not
otherwise
discernible
by
night
and
indeed
at
all
times
was
rather
a
thing
to
be
investigated
than
beheld
so
much
more
wall
than
window
was
there
in
the
apartment
is
nearly
eight
said
she
and
neither
dress
nor
man
said
hall
if
you
think
to
tantalize
me
by
talking
like
that
you
are
much
mistaken
let
him
be
as
late
as
he
will
or
stay
away
altogether
i
do
care
said
sally
but
a
tender
minute
quaver
in
the
negation
showed
that
there
was
something
forced
in
that
statement
hall
perceived
it
and
drily
observed
that
she
was
not
so
sure
about
sally
not
caring
perhaps
you
do
care
so
much
as
i
do
after
all
she
said
i
see
what
you
do
that
it
is
a
good
and
flourishing
match
for
you
a
very
honourable
offer
in
darton
and
i
think
i
see
a
kind
husband
in
him
so
pray
god
go
smooth
and
wind
up
well
sally
would
not
listen
to
misgivings
of
course
it
would
go
smoothly
she
asserted
you
are
up
and
down
mother
she
went
on
this
moment
whatever
hinders
him
we
are
not
so
anxious
to
see
him
as
he
is
to
be
here
and
his
thought
runs
on
before
him
and
settles
down
upon
us
like
the
star
in
the
east
hark
she
exclaimed
with
a
breath
of
relief
her
eyes
sparkling
heard
something
yes
here
they
are
the
next
moment
her
mother
slower
ear
also
distinguished
the
familiar
reverberation
occasioned
by
footsteps
clambering
up
the
roots
of
the
sycamore
it
sounds
like
them
at
last
she
said
it
is
not
so
very
late
after
all
considering
the
distance
the
footfall
ceased
and
they
arose
expecting
a
knock
they
began
to
think
it
might
have
been
after
all
some
neighbouring
villager
under
bacchic
influence
giving
the
centre
of
the
road
a
wide
berth
when
their
doubts
were
dispelled
by
the
entry
into
the
passage
the
door
of
the
room
was
gently
opened
and
there
appeared
not
the
pair
of
travellers
with
whom
we
have
already
made
acquaintance
but
a
man
in
the
garb
of
extreme
poverty
almost
in
rags
it
a
tramp
gracious
me
said
sally
starting
back
his
cheeks
and
were
deep
concaves
rather
it
might
be
from
natural
weakness
of
constitution
than
irregular
living
though
there
were
indications
that
he
had
led
no
careful
life
he
gazed
at
the
two
women
fixedly
for
a
moment
then
with
an
abashed
humiliated
demeanour
dropped
his
glance
to
the
floor
and
sank
into
a
chair
without
uttering
a
word
sally
was
in
advance
of
her
mother
who
had
remained
standing
by
the
fire
she
now
tried
to
discern
the
visitor
across
the
candles
mother
said
sally
faintly
turning
back
to
hall
is
phil
from
australia
hall
started
and
grew
pale
and
a
fit
of
coughing
seized
the
man
with
the
ragged
clothes
come
home
like
this
she
said
philip
are
you
ill
no
mother
replied
he
impatiently
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
for
god
sake
how
do
you
come
here
and
just
now
too
i
am
here
said
the
man
it
is
i
hardly
know
i
come
home
mother
because
i
was
driven
to
it
things
were
against
me
out
there
and
went
from
bad
to
worse
why
did
you
let
us
know
you
not
writ
a
line
for
the
last
two
or
three
years
the
son
admitted
sadly
that
he
had
not
he
said
that
he
had
hoped
and
thought
he
might
fetch
up
again
and
be
able
to
send
good
news
then
he
had
been
obliged
to
abandon
that
hope
and
had
finally
come
home
from
sheer
necessity
previously
to
making
a
new
start
things
are
very
bad
with
me
he
repeated
perceiving
their
commiserating
glances
at
his
clothes
they
brought
him
nearer
the
fire
took
his
hat
from
his
thin
hand
which
was
so
small
and
smooth
as
to
show
that
his
attempts
to
fetch
up
again
had
not
been
in
a
manual
direction
his
mother
resumed
her
inquiries
and
dubiously
asked
if
he
had
chosen
to
come
that
particular
night
for
any
special
reason
for
no
reason
he
told
her
his
arrival
had
been
quite
at
random
then
philip
hall
looked
round
the
room
and
saw
for
the
first
time
that
the
table
was
laid
somewhat
luxuriously
and
for
a
larger
number
than
themselves
and
that
an
air
of
festivity
pervaded
their
dress
he
asked
quickly
what
was
going
on
is
going
to
be
married
in
a
day
or
two
replied
the
mother
and
she
explained
how
darton
sally
intended
husband
was
coming
there
that
night
with
the
groomsman
johns
and
other
details
thought
it
must
be
their
step
when
we
heard
you
said
hall
the
needy
wanderer
looked
again
on
the
floor
see
i
see
he
murmured
indeed
should
i
have
come
such
folk
as
i
are
not
wanted
here
at
these
times
naturally
and
i
have
no
business
here
spoiling
other
people
happiness
said
his
mother
with
a
tear
in
her
eye
but
with
a
thinness
of
lip
and
severity
of
manner
which
were
presumably
not
more
than
past
events
justified
you
speak
like
that
to
me
i
speak
honestly
to
you
for
these
three
years
you
have
taken
no
thought
for
us
you
left
home
with
a
good
supply
of
money
and
strength
and
education
and
you
ought
to
have
made
good
use
of
it
all
but
you
come
back
like
a
beggar
and
that
you
come
in
a
very
awkward
time
for
us
can
not
be
denied
your
return
may
do
us
much
harm
but
mind
you
are
welcome
to
this
home
as
long
as
it
is
mine
i
do
wish
to
turn
you
adrift
we
will
make
the
best
of
a
bad
job
and
i
hope
you
are
not
seriously
ill
no
i
have
only
this
infernal
cough
she
looked
at
him
anxiously
think
you
had
better
go
to
bed
at
once
she
said
i
shall
be
out
of
the
way
there
said
the
son
wearily
ruined
myself
do
let
me
ruin
you
by
being
seen
in
these
togs
for
heaven
sake
who
do
you
say
sally
is
going
to
be
married
to
a
farmer
darton
a
quite
a
wealthy
man
far
better
in
station
than
she
could
have
expected
it
is
a
good
thing
altogether
done
little
sal
said
her
brother
brightening
and
looking
up
at
her
with
a
smile
ought
to
have
written
but
perhaps
i
have
thought
of
you
all
the
more
but
let
me
get
out
of
sight
i
would
rather
go
and
jump
into
the
river
than
be
seen
here
but
have
you
anything
i
can
drink
i
am
confoundedly
thirsty
with
my
long
tramp
yes
we
will
bring
something
upstairs
to
you
said
sally
with
grief
in
her
face
that
will
do
nicely
but
sally
and
mother
he
stopped
and
they
waited
i
have
not
told
you
all
he
resumed
slowly
still
looking
on
the
floor
between
his
knees
as
what
you
see
of
me
is
there
worse
behind
his
mother
gazed
upon
him
in
grieved
suspense
and
sally
went
and
leant
upon
the
bureau
listening
for
every
sound
and
sighing
suddenly
she
turned
round
saying
them
come
i
do
care
philip
tell
the
worst
and
take
your
time
then
said
the
unhappy
phil
am
not
the
only
one
in
this
mess
would
to
heaven
i
were
but
phil
have
a
wife
as
destitute
as
i
wife
said
his
mother
wife
yes
that
is
the
way
with
sons
besides
said
he
o
philip
surely
have
two
little
children
and
children
whispered
hall
sinking
down
confounded
little
things
said
sally
involuntarily
his
mother
turned
again
to
him
suppose
these
helpless
beings
are
left
in
australia
they
are
in
england
i
can
only
hope
you
left
them
in
a
respectable
place
have
not
left
them
at
all
they
are
here
within
a
few
yards
of
us
in
short
they
are
in
the
stable
the
stable
i
did
not
like
to
bring
them
indoors
till
i
had
seen
you
mother
and
broken
the
bad
news
a
bit
to
you
they
were
very
tired
and
are
resting
out
there
on
some
straw
hall
fortitude
visibly
broke
down
she
had
been
brought
up
not
without
refinement
and
was
even
more
moved
by
such
a
collapse
of
genteel
aims
as
this
than
a
substantial
dairyman
widow
would
in
ordinary
have
been
moved
it
must
be
borne
she
said
in
a
low
voice
with
her
hands
tightly
joined
starving
son
a
starving
wife
starving
children
let
it
be
but
why
is
this
come
to
us
now
could
no
other
misfortune
happen
to
helpless
women
than
this
which
will
quite
upset
my
poor
girl
chance
of
a
happy
life
why
have
you
done
us
this
wrong
philip
what
respectable
man
will
come
here
and
marry
eyed
into
a
family
of
vagabonds
mother
said
sally
vehemently
while
her
face
flushed
is
the
man
to
desert
me
but
if
he
should
be
and
marry
me
because
phil
come
let
him
go
and
marry
elsewhere
i
wo
be
ashamed
of
my
own
flesh
and
blood
for
any
man
in
england
not
i
and
then
sally
turned
away
and
burst
into
tears
till
you
are
twenty
years
older
and
you
will
tell
a
different
tale
replied
her
mother
the
son
stood
up
he
said
bitterly
i
have
come
so
i
will
go
all
i
ask
of
you
is
that
you
will
allow
me
and
mine
to
lie
in
your
stable
i
give
you
my
word
that
we
be
gone
by
break
of
day
and
trouble
you
no
further
hall
the
mother
changed
at
that
no
she
answered
hastily
shall
it
be
said
that
i
sent
any
of
my
own
family
from
my
door
bring
in
philip
or
take
me
out
to
them
will
put
all
into
the
large
bedroom
said
sally
brightening
make
up
a
large
fire
let
go
and
help
them
in
and
call
rebekah
rebekah
was
the
woman
who
assisted
at
the
dairy
and
housework
she
lived
in
a
cottage
hard
by
with
her
husband
who
attended
to
the
cows
sally
went
to
fetch
a
lantern
from
the
but
her
brother
said
wo
want
a
light
i
lit
the
lantern
that
was
hanging
there
must
we
call
your
wife
asked
hall
said
philip
with
shawls
over
their
heads
they
proceeded
towards
the
back
door
minute
before
you
go
interrupted
philip
i
have
confessed
all
heaven
help
us
said
hall
pushing
to
the
door
and
clasping
her
hands
in
calm
despair
passed
through
evershead
as
we
came
he
continued
i
just
looked
in
at
the
to
see
if
old
mike
still
kept
on
there
as
usual
the
carrier
had
come
in
from
sherton
abbas
at
that
moment
and
guessing
that
i
was
bound
for
this
place
for
i
think
he
knew
me
he
asked
me
to
bring
on
a
dressmaker
parcel
for
sally
that
was
marked
immediate
my
wife
had
walked
on
with
the
children
was
a
flimsy
parcel
and
the
paper
was
torn
and
i
found
on
looking
at
it
that
it
was
a
thick
warm
gown
i
did
wish
you
to
see
poor
helena
in
a
shabby
state
i
was
ashamed
that
you
should
was
not
what
she
was
born
to
i
untied
the
parcel
in
the
road
took
it
on
to
her
where
she
was
waiting
in
the
lower
barn
and
told
her
i
had
managed
to
get
it
for
her
and
that
she
was
to
ask
no
question
she
poor
thing
must
have
supposed
i
obtained
it
on
trust
through
having
reached
a
place
where
i
was
known
for
she
put
it
on
gladly
enough
she
has
it
on
now
sally
has
other
gowns
i
daresay
sally
looked
at
her
mother
speechless
have
others
i
daresay
repeated
phil
with
a
sick
impatience
thought
to
myself
better
sally
cry
than
helena
freeze
well
is
the
dress
of
great
consequence
was
nothing
very
ornamental
as
far
as
i
could
see
no
not
of
consequence
returned
sally
sadly
adding
in
a
gentle
voice
will
not
mind
if
i
lend
her
another
instead
of
that
one
will
you
philip
agitation
at
the
confession
had
brought
on
another
attack
of
the
cough
which
seemed
to
shake
him
to
pieces
he
was
so
obviously
unfit
to
sit
in
a
chair
that
they
helped
him
upstairs
at
once
and
having
hastily
given
him
a
cordial
and
kindled
the
bedroom
fire
they
descended
to
fetch
their
unhappy
new
relations
chapter
iii
it
was
with
strange
feelings
that
the
girl
and
her
mother
lately
so
cheerful
passed
out
of
the
back
door
into
the
open
air
of
the
barton
laden
with
hay
scents
and
the
herby
breath
of
cows
a
fine
sleet
had
begun
to
fall
and
they
trotted
across
the
yard
quickly
the
was
open
a
light
shone
from
it
from
the
lantern
which
always
hung
there
and
which
philip
had
lighted
as
he
said
softly
nearing
the
door
hall
pronounced
the
name
there
was
no
answer
for
the
moment
looking
in
she
was
taken
by
surprise
two
people
appeared
before
her
for
one
instead
of
the
drabbish
woman
she
had
expected
hall
saw
a
pale
ladylike
creature
whose
personality
ruled
her
attire
rather
than
was
ruled
by
it
she
was
in
a
new
and
handsome
gown
of
course
and
an
old
bonnet
she
was
standing
up
agitated
her
hand
was
held
by
her
companion
none
else
than
sally
affianced
farmer
charles
darton
upon
whose
fine
figure
the
pale
stranger
eyes
were
fixed
as
his
were
fixed
upon
her
his
other
hand
held
the
rein
of
his
horse
which
was
standing
saddled
as
if
just
led
in
at
sight
of
hall
they
both
turned
looking
at
her
in
a
way
neither
quite
conscious
nor
unconscious
and
without
seeming
to
recollect
that
words
were
necessary
as
a
solution
to
the
scene
in
another
moment
sally
entered
also
when
darton
dropped
his
companion
hand
led
the
horse
aside
and
came
to
greet
his
betrothed
and
hall
he
said
smiling
with
something
like
forced
composure
is
a
roundabout
way
of
arriving
you
will
say
my
dear
hall
but
we
lost
our
way
which
made
us
late
i
saw
a
light
here
and
led
in
my
horse
at
once
my
friend
johns
and
my
man
have
gone
back
to
the
little
inn
with
theirs
not
to
crowd
you
too
much
no
sooner
had
i
entered
than
i
saw
that
this
lady
had
taken
temporary
shelter
here
and
found
i
was
intruding
is
my
said
hall
calmly
son
too
is
in
the
house
but
he
has
gone
to
bed
unwell
sally
had
stood
staring
wonderingly
at
the
scene
until
this
moment
hardly
recognizing
darton
shake
of
the
hand
the
spell
that
bound
her
was
broken
by
her
perceiving
the
two
little
children
seated
on
a
heap
of
hay
she
suddenly
went
forward
spoke
to
them
and
took
one
on
her
arm
and
the
other
in
her
hand
two
children
said
darton
showing
thus
that
he
had
not
been
there
long
enough
as
yet
to
understand
the
situation
grandchildren
said
hall
with
as
much
affected
ease
as
before
philip
hall
wife
in
spite
of
this
interruption
to
her
first
rencounter
seemed
scarcely
so
much
affected
by
it
as
to
feel
any
presence
in
addition
to
darton
however
arousing
herself
by
a
quick
reflection
she
threw
a
sudden
critical
glance
of
her
sad
eyes
upon
hall
and
apparently
finding
her
satisfactory
advanced
to
her
in
a
meek
initiative
then
sally
and
the
stranger
spoke
some
friendly
words
to
each
other
and
sally
went
on
with
the
children
into
the
house
hall
and
helena
followed
and
darton
followed
these
looking
at
helena
dress
and
outline
and
listening
to
her
voice
like
a
man
in
a
dream
by
the
time
the
others
reached
the
house
sally
had
already
gone
upstairs
with
the
tired
children
she
rapped
against
the
wall
for
rebekah
to
come
in
and
help
to
attend
to
them
rebekah
house
being
a
little
dab
cabin
leaning
against
the
substantial
of
taller
erection
when
she
came
a
bed
was
made
up
for
the
little
ones
and
some
supper
given
to
them
on
descending
the
stairs
after
seeing
this
done
sally
went
to
the
young
hall
entered
it
just
in
advance
of
her
having
in
the
interim
retired
with
her
law
to
take
off
her
bonnet
and
otherwise
make
herself
presentable
hence
it
was
evident
that
no
further
communication
could
have
passed
between
her
and
darton
since
their
brief
interview
in
the
stable
japheth
johns
now
opportunely
arrived
and
broke
up
the
restraint
of
the
company
after
a
few
orthodox
meteorological
commentaries
had
passed
between
him
and
hall
by
way
of
introduction
they
at
once
sat
down
to
supper
the
present
of
wine
and
turkey
not
being
produced
for
consumption
lest
the
premature
display
of
those
gifts
should
seem
to
throw
doubt
on
hall
capacities
as
a
provider
hearty
johns
drink
hearty
said
that
matron
magnanimously
as
it
is
there
plenty
of
but
perhaps
is
not
to
your
taste
though
there
body
in
it
the
contrairy
quite
the
contrairy
said
the
dairyman
though
i
inherit
the
principle
from
my
father
i
am
a
on
my
mother
side
she
came
from
these
parts
you
know
and
there
this
to
be
said
is
a
more
peaceful
liquor
and
lie
about
a
man
like
your
hotter
drinks
with
care
one
may
live
on
it
a
twelvemonth
without
knocking
down
a
neighbour
or
getting
a
black
eye
from
an
old
acquaintance
the
general
conversation
thus
begun
was
continued
briskly
though
it
was
in
the
main
restricted
to
hall
and
japheth
who
in
truth
required
but
little
help
from
anybody
there
being
slight
call
upon
tongue
she
had
ample
leisure
to
do
what
her
heart
most
desired
namely
watch
her
intended
husband
and
her
with
a
view
of
elucidating
the
strange
momentary
scene
in
which
her
mother
and
herself
had
surprised
them
in
the
stable
if
that
scene
meant
anything
it
meant
at
least
that
they
had
met
before
that
there
had
been
no
time
for
explanations
sally
could
see
for
their
manner
was
still
one
of
suppressed
amazement
at
each
other
presence
there
darton
eyes
too
fell
continually
on
the
gown
worn
by
helena
as
if
this
were
an
added
riddle
to
his
perplexity
though
to
sally
it
was
the
one
feature
in
the
case
which
was
no
mystery
he
seemed
to
feel
that
fate
had
impishly
changed
his
in
the
lover
jig
he
was
about
to
foot
that
while
the
gown
had
been
expected
to
enclose
a
sally
a
helena
face
looked
out
from
the
bodice
that
some
hand
met
his
own
from
the
sleeves
sally
could
see
that
whatever
helena
might
know
of
darton
she
knew
nothing
of
how
the
dress
entered
into
his
embarrassment
and
at
moments
the
young
girl
would
have
persuaded
herself
that
darton
looks
at
her
were
entirely
the
fruit
of
the
clothes
query
but
surely
at
other
times
a
more
extensive
range
of
speculation
and
sentiment
was
expressed
by
her
lover
eye
than
that
which
the
changed
dress
would
account
for
sally
independence
made
her
one
of
the
least
jealous
of
women
but
there
was
something
in
the
relations
of
these
two
visitors
which
ought
to
be
explained
japheth
johns
continued
to
converse
in
his
style
interspersing
his
talk
with
some
private
reflections
on
the
position
of
darton
and
sally
which
though
the
sparkle
in
his
eye
showed
them
to
be
highly
entertaining
to
himself
were
apparently
not
quite
communicable
to
the
company
at
last
he
withdrew
for
the
night
going
off
to
the
roadside
inn
back
whither
darton
promised
to
follow
him
in
a
few
minutes
passed
and
then
darton
also
rose
to
leave
sally
and
her
simultaneously
wishing
him
as
they
retired
upstairs
to
their
rooms
but
on
his
arriving
at
the
front
door
with
hall
a
sharp
shower
of
rain
began
to
come
down
when
the
widow
suggested
that
he
should
return
to
the
till
the
storm
ceased
darton
accepted
her
proposal
but
insisted
that
as
it
was
getting
late
and
she
was
obviously
tired
she
should
not
sit
up
on
his
account
since
he
could
let
himself
out
of
the
house
and
would
quite
enjoy
smoking
a
pipe
by
the
hearth
alone
hall
assented
and
darton
was
left
by
himself
he
spread
his
knees
to
the
brands
lit
up
his
tobacco
as
he
had
said
and
sat
gazing
into
the
fire
and
at
the
notches
of
the
crook
which
hung
above
an
occasional
drop
of
rain
rolled
down
the
chimney
with
a
hiss
and
still
he
smoked
on
but
not
like
a
man
whose
mind
was
at
rest
in
the
long
run
however
despite
his
meditations
early
hours
afield
and
a
long
ride
in
the
open
air
produced
their
natural
result
he
began
to
doze
how
long
he
remained
in
this
state
he
did
not
know
he
suddenly
opened
his
eyes
the
had
burnt
itself
in
two
and
ceased
to
flame
the
light
which
he
had
placed
on
the
mantelpiece
had
nearly
gone
out
but
in
spite
of
these
deficiencies
there
was
a
light
in
the
apartment
and
it
came
from
elsewhere
turning
his
head
he
saw
philip
hall
wife
standing
at
the
entrance
of
the
room
with
a
in
one
hand
a
small
brass
in
the
other
and
his
gown
as
it
certainly
seemed
still
upon
her
said
darton
starting
up
her
countenance
expressed
dismay
and
her
first
words
were
an
apology
did
not
know
you
were
here
darton
she
said
while
a
blush
flashed
to
her
cheek
thought
every
one
had
retired
i
was
coming
to
make
a
little
water
boil
my
husband
seems
to
be
worse
but
perhaps
the
kitchen
fire
can
be
lighted
up
again
go
on
my
account
by
all
means
put
it
on
here
as
you
intended
said
darton
me
to
help
you
he
went
forward
to
take
the
kettle
from
her
hand
but
she
did
not
allow
him
and
placed
it
on
the
fire
herself
they
stood
some
way
apart
one
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
waiting
till
the
water
should
boil
the
candle
on
the
mantel
between
them
and
helena
with
her
eyes
on
the
kettle
darton
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
i
call
sally
he
said
no
she
quickly
returned
have
given
trouble
enough
already
we
have
no
right
here
but
we
are
the
sport
of
fate
and
were
obliged
to
come
right
here
said
he
in
surprise
i
ca
explain
it
now
answered
helena
kettle
is
very
slow
there
was
another
pause
the
proverbial
dilatoriness
of
watched
pots
was
never
more
clearly
exemplified
helena
face
was
of
that
sort
which
seems
to
ask
for
assistance
without
the
owner
knowledge
the
very
antipodes
of
sally
which
was
expressed
darton
eyes
travelled
from
the
kettle
to
helena
face
then
back
to
the
kettle
then
to
the
face
for
rather
a
longer
time
i
am
not
to
know
anything
of
the
mystery
that
has
distracted
me
all
the
evening
he
said
is
it
that
a
woman
who
refused
me
because
as
i
supposed
my
position
was
not
good
enough
for
her
taste
is
found
to
be
the
wife
of
a
man
who
certainly
seems
to
be
worse
off
than
i
had
the
prior
claim
said
she
you
knew
him
at
that
time
yes
please
say
no
more
she
implored
my
errors
i
have
paid
for
them
during
the
last
five
years
the
heart
of
darton
was
subject
to
sudden
overflowings
he
was
kind
to
a
fault
am
sorry
from
my
soul
he
said
involuntarily
approaching
her
helena
withdrew
a
step
or
two
at
which
he
became
conscious
of
his
movement
and
quickly
took
his
former
place
here
he
stood
without
speaking
and
the
little
kettle
began
to
sing
you
might
have
been
my
wife
if
you
had
chosen
he
said
at
last
that
all
past
and
gone
however
if
you
are
in
any
trouble
or
poverty
i
shall
be
glad
to
be
of
service
and
as
your
relation
by
marriage
i
shall
have
a
right
to
be
does
your
uncle
know
of
your
distress
uncle
is
dead
he
left
me
without
a
farthing
and
now
we
have
two
children
to
maintain
left
you
nothing
how
could
he
be
so
cruel
as
that
disgraced
myself
in
his
eyes
said
darton
earnestly
me
take
care
of
the
children
at
least
while
you
are
so
unsettled
you
belong
to
another
so
i
can
not
take
care
of
you
you
can
said
a
voice
and
suddenly
a
third
figure
stood
beside
them
it
was
sally
can
since
you
seem
to
wish
to
she
repeated
no
longer
belongs
to
another
my
poor
brother
is
dead
her
face
was
red
her
eyes
sparkled
and
all
the
woman
came
to
the
front
have
heard
it
she
went
on
to
him
passionately
can
protect
her
now
as
well
as
the
children
she
turned
then
to
her
agitated
law
heard
something
said
sally
in
a
gentle
murmur
differing
much
from
her
previous
passionate
words
i
went
into
his
room
it
must
have
been
the
moment
you
left
he
went
off
so
quickly
and
weakly
and
it
was
so
unexpected
that
i
could
leave
even
to
call
you
darton
was
just
able
to
gather
from
the
confused
discourse
which
followed
that
during
his
sleep
by
the
fire
this
brother
whom
he
had
never
seen
had
become
worse
and
that
during
helena
absence
for
water
the
end
had
unexpectedly
come
the
two
young
women
hastened
upstairs
and
he
was
again
left
alone
after
standing
there
a
short
time
he
went
to
the
front
door
and
looked
out
till
softly
closing
it
behind
him
he
advanced
and
stood
under
the
large
the
stars
were
flickering
coldly
and
the
dampness
which
had
just
descended
upon
the
earth
in
rain
now
sent
up
a
chill
from
it
darton
was
in
a
strange
position
and
he
felt
it
the
unexpected
appearance
in
deep
poverty
of
helena
a
young
lady
daughter
of
a
deceased
naval
officer
who
had
been
brought
up
by
her
uncle
a
solicitor
and
had
refused
darton
in
marriage
years
ago
the
passionate
almost
angry
demeanour
of
sally
at
discovering
them
the
abrupt
announcement
that
helena
was
a
widow
all
this
coming
together
was
a
conjuncture
difficult
to
cope
with
in
a
moment
and
made
him
question
whether
he
ought
to
leave
the
house
or
offer
assistance
but
for
manner
he
would
unhesitatingly
have
done
the
latter
he
was
still
standing
under
the
tree
when
the
door
in
front
of
him
opened
and
hall
came
out
she
went
round
to
the
at
the
side
without
seeing
him
darton
followed
her
intending
to
speak
pausing
outside
as
if
in
thought
she
proceeded
to
a
spot
where
the
sun
came
earliest
in
and
where
the
north
wind
never
blew
it
was
where
the
row
of
beehives
stood
under
the
wall
discerning
her
object
he
waited
till
she
had
accomplished
it
it
was
the
universal
custom
thereabout
to
wake
the
bees
by
tapping
at
their
hives
whenever
a
death
occurred
in
the
household
under
the
belief
that
if
this
were
not
done
the
bees
themselves
would
pine
away
and
perish
during
the
ensuing
year
as
soon
as
an
interior
buzzing
responded
to
her
tap
at
the
first
hive
hall
went
on
to
the
second
and
thus
passed
down
the
row
as
soon
as
she
came
back
he
met
her
can
i
do
in
this
trouble
mrs
hall
he
said
nothing
thank
you
nothing
she
said
in
a
tearful
voice
now
just
perceiving
him
have
called
rebekah
and
her
husband
and
they
will
do
everything
necessary
she
told
him
in
a
few
words
the
particulars
of
her
son
arrival
broken
in
health
indeed
at
death
very
door
though
they
did
not
suspect
it
and
suggested
as
the
result
of
a
conversation
between
her
and
her
daughter
that
the
wedding
should
be
postponed
of
course
said
darton
think
now
to
go
straight
to
the
inn
and
tell
johns
what
has
happened
it
was
not
till
after
he
had
shaken
hands
with
her
that
he
turned
hesitatingly
and
added
you
tell
the
mother
of
his
children
that
as
they
are
now
left
fatherless
i
shall
be
glad
to
take
the
eldest
of
them
if
it
would
be
any
convenience
to
her
and
to
you
hall
promised
that
her
son
widow
should
he
told
of
the
offer
and
they
parted
he
retired
down
the
rooty
slope
and
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
inn
where
he
informed
johns
of
the
circumstances
meanwhile
hall
had
entered
the
house
sally
was
downstairs
in
the
alone
and
her
mother
explained
to
her
that
darton
had
readily
assented
to
the
postponement
doubt
he
has
said
sally
with
sad
emphasis
is
not
put
off
for
a
week
or
a
month
or
a
year
i
shall
never
marry
him
and
she
will
chapter
iv
time
passed
and
the
household
on
the
knap
became
again
serene
under
the
composing
influences
of
daily
routine
a
desultory
very
desultory
correspondence
dragged
on
between
sally
hall
and
darton
who
not
quite
knowing
how
to
take
her
petulant
words
on
the
night
of
her
death
had
continued
passive
thus
long
helena
and
her
children
remained
at
the
almost
of
necessity
and
darton
therefore
deemed
it
advisable
to
stay
away
one
day
seven
months
later
on
when
darton
was
as
usual
at
his
farm
twenty
miles
from
hintock
a
note
reached
him
from
helena
she
thanked
him
for
his
kind
offer
about
her
children
which
her
had
duly
communicated
and
stated
that
she
would
be
glad
to
accept
it
as
regarded
the
eldest
the
boy
helena
had
in
truth
good
need
to
do
so
for
her
uncle
had
left
her
penniless
and
all
application
to
some
relatives
in
the
north
had
failed
there
was
besides
as
she
said
no
good
school
near
hintock
to
which
she
could
send
the
child
on
a
fine
summer
day
the
boy
came
he
was
accompanied
by
sally
and
his
mother
to
the
horse
at
chalk
newton
where
he
was
handed
over
to
darton
bailiff
in
a
shining
who
met
them
there
he
was
entered
as
a
at
a
popular
school
at
casterbridge
three
or
four
miles
from
darton
having
first
been
taught
by
darton
to
ride
a
on
which
he
cantered
to
and
from
the
aforesaid
fount
of
knowledge
and
as
darton
hoped
brought
away
a
promising
headful
of
the
same
at
each
diurnal
expedition
the
thoughtful
taciturnity
into
which
darton
had
latterly
fallen
was
quite
dissipated
by
the
presence
of
this
boy
when
the
christmas
holidays
came
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
spend
them
with
his
mother
the
journey
was
for
some
reason
or
other
performed
in
two
stages
as
at
his
coming
except
that
darton
in
person
took
the
place
of
the
bailiff
and
that
the
boy
and
himself
rode
on
horseback
reaching
the
renowned
horse
darton
inquired
if
miss
and
young
hall
were
there
to
meet
little
philip
as
they
had
agreed
to
be
he
was
answered
by
the
appearance
of
helena
alone
at
the
door
the
last
moment
sally
would
not
come
she
faltered
that
meeting
practically
settled
the
point
towards
which
these
persons
were
converging
but
nothing
was
broached
about
it
for
some
time
yet
sally
hall
had
in
fact
imparted
the
first
decisive
motion
to
events
by
refusing
to
accompany
helena
she
soon
gave
them
a
second
move
by
writing
the
following
note
private
charles
living
here
so
long
and
intimately
with
helena
i
have
naturally
learnt
her
history
especially
that
of
it
which
refers
to
you
i
am
sure
she
would
accept
you
as
a
husband
at
the
proper
time
and
i
think
you
ought
to
give
her
the
opportunity
you
inquire
in
an
old
note
if
i
am
sorry
that
i
showed
temper
which
it
was
that
night
when
i
heard
you
talking
to
her
no
charles
i
am
not
sorry
at
all
for
what
i
said
yours
sincerely
sally
hall
thus
set
in
train
the
transfer
of
darton
heart
back
to
its
original
quarters
proceeded
by
mere
lapse
of
time
in
the
following
july
darton
went
to
his
friend
japheth
to
ask
him
at
last
to
fulfil
the
bridal
office
which
had
been
in
abeyance
since
the
previous
january
twelvemonths
all
my
heart
man
o
constancy
said
dairyman
johns
warmly
lost
most
of
my
genteel
fair
complexion
haymaking
this
hot
weather
is
true
but
i
do
your
business
as
well
as
them
that
look
better
there
be
scents
and
good
in
the
world
yet
thank
god
and
they
take
off
the
roughest
o
my
edge
i
compliment
her
better
late
than
never
sally
hall
i
say
is
not
sally
said
darton
hurriedly
is
young
mrs
hall
japheth
face
as
soon
as
he
really
comprehended
became
a
picture
of
reproachful
dismay
sally
he
said
not
sally
i
believe
it
young
hall
well
well
where
your
wisdom
darton
shortly
explained
particulars
but
johns
would
not
be
reconciled
was
a
woman
worth
having
if
ever
woman
was
he
cried
now
to
let
her
go
i
suppose
i
can
marry
where
i
like
said
darton
replied
the
dairyman
lifting
his
eyebrows
expressively
do
become
you
charles
it
really
do
not
if
i
had
done
such
a
thing
you
would
have
sworn
i
was
a
curst
fool
to
be
drawn
off
the
scent
by
such
a
farmer
darton
responded
in
such
sharp
terms
to
this
laconic
opinion
that
the
two
friends
finally
parted
in
a
way
they
had
never
parted
before
johns
was
to
be
no
groomsman
to
darton
after
all
he
had
flatly
declined
darton
went
off
sorry
and
even
unhappy
particularly
as
japheth
was
about
to
leave
that
side
of
the
county
so
that
the
words
which
had
divided
them
were
not
likely
to
be
explained
away
or
softened
down
a
short
time
after
the
interview
darton
was
united
to
helena
at
a
simple
fact
wedding
and
she
and
her
little
girl
joined
the
boy
who
had
already
grown
to
look
on
darton
house
as
home
for
some
months
the
farmer
experienced
an
unprecedented
happiness
and
satisfaction
there
had
been
a
flaw
in
his
life
and
it
was
as
neatly
mended
as
was
humanly
possible
but
after
a
season
the
stream
of
events
followed
less
clearly
and
there
were
shades
in
his
reveries
helena
was
a
fragile
woman
of
little
staying
power
physically
or
morally
and
since
the
time
that
he
had
originally
known
her
eight
or
ten
years
before
she
had
been
severely
tried
she
had
loved
herself
out
in
short
and
was
now
occasionally
given
to
moping
sometimes
she
spoke
regretfully
of
the
gentilities
of
her
early
life
and
instead
of
comparing
her
present
state
with
her
condition
as
the
wife
of
the
unlucky
hall
she
mused
rather
on
what
it
had
been
before
she
took
the
first
fatal
step
of
clandestinely
marrying
him
she
did
not
care
to
please
such
people
as
those
with
whom
she
was
thrown
as
a
thriving
wife
she
allowed
the
pretty
trifles
of
agricultural
domesticity
to
glide
by
her
as
sorry
details
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
children
darton
house
would
have
seemed
but
little
brighter
than
it
had
been
before
this
led
to
occasional
unpleasantness
until
darton
sometimes
declared
to
himself
that
such
endeavours
as
his
to
rectify
early
deviations
of
the
heart
by
harking
back
to
the
old
point
mostly
failed
of
success
johns
was
right
he
would
say
should
have
gone
on
with
sally
better
go
with
the
tide
and
make
the
best
of
its
course
than
stem
it
at
the
risk
of
a
capsize
but
he
kept
these
unmelodious
thoughts
to
himself
and
was
outwardly
considerate
and
kind
this
somewhat
barren
tract
of
his
life
had
extended
to
less
than
a
year
and
a
half
when
his
ponderings
were
cut
short
by
the
loss
of
the
woman
they
concerned
when
she
was
in
her
grave
he
thought
better
of
her
than
when
she
had
been
alive
the
farm
was
a
worse
place
without
her
than
with
her
after
all
no
woman
short
of
divine
could
have
gone
through
such
an
experience
as
hers
with
her
first
husband
without
becoming
a
little
soured
her
stagnant
sympathies
her
sometimes
unreasonable
manner
had
covered
a
heart
frank
and
well
meaning
and
originally
hopeful
and
warm
she
left
him
a
tiny
red
infant
in
white
wrappings
to
make
life
as
easy
as
possible
to
this
touching
object
became
at
once
his
care
as
this
child
learnt
to
walk
and
talk
darton
learnt
to
see
feasibility
in
a
scheme
which
pleased
him
revolving
the
experiment
which
he
had
hitherto
made
upon
life
he
fancied
he
had
gained
wisdom
from
his
mistakes
and
caution
from
his
miscarriages
what
the
scheme
was
needs
no
penetration
to
discover
once
more
he
had
opportunity
to
recast
and
rectify
his
situations
by
returning
to
sally
hall
who
still
lived
quietly
on
under
her
mother
roof
at
hintock
helena
had
been
a
woman
to
lend
pathos
and
refinement
to
a
home
sally
was
the
woman
to
brighten
it
she
would
not
as
helena
did
despise
the
rural
simplicities
of
a
farmer
fireside
moreover
she
had
a
qualification
for
darton
household
no
other
woman
could
make
so
desirable
a
mother
to
her
brother
two
children
and
darton
one
as
sally
while
darton
now
that
helena
had
gone
was
a
more
promising
husband
for
sally
than
he
had
ever
been
when
liable
to
reminders
from
an
uncured
sentimental
wound
darton
was
not
a
man
to
act
rapidly
and
the
working
out
of
his
reparative
designs
might
have
been
delayed
for
some
time
but
there
came
a
winter
evening
precisely
like
the
one
which
had
darkened
over
that
former
ride
to
hintock
and
he
asked
himself
why
he
should
postpone
longer
when
the
very
landscape
called
for
a
repetition
of
that
attempt
he
told
his
man
to
saddle
the
mare
booted
and
spurred
himself
with
a
younger
horseman
nicety
kissed
the
two
youngest
children
and
rode
off
to
make
the
journey
a
complete
parallel
to
the
first
he
would
fain
have
had
his
old
acquaintance
japheth
johns
with
him
but
johns
alas
was
missing
his
removal
to
the
other
side
of
the
county
had
left
unrepaired
the
breach
which
had
arisen
between
him
and
darton
and
though
darton
had
forgiven
him
a
hundred
times
as
johns
had
probably
forgiven
darton
the
effort
of
reunion
in
present
circumstances
was
one
not
likely
to
be
made
he
screwed
himself
up
to
as
cheerful
a
pitch
as
he
could
without
his
former
crony
and
became
content
with
his
own
thoughts
as
he
rode
instead
of
the
words
of
a
companion
the
sun
went
down
the
boughs
appeared
scratched
in
like
an
etching
against
the
sky
old
crooked
men
with
faggots
at
their
backs
said
sir
and
darton
replied
right
heartily
by
the
time
he
reached
the
forking
roads
it
was
getting
as
dark
as
it
had
been
on
the
occasion
when
johns
climbed
the
darton
made
no
mistake
this
time
shall
i
be
able
to
mistake
thank
heaven
when
i
arrive
he
murmured
it
gave
him
peculiar
satisfaction
to
think
that
the
proposed
marriage
like
his
first
was
of
the
nature
of
setting
in
order
things
long
awry
and
not
a
momentary
freak
of
fancy
nothing
hindered
the
smoothness
of
his
journey
which
seemed
not
half
its
former
length
though
dark
it
was
only
between
five
and
six
when
the
bulky
chimneys
of
hall
residence
appeared
in
view
behind
the
on
second
thoughts
he
retreated
and
put
up
at
the
house
as
in
former
time
and
when
he
had
plumed
himself
before
the
inn
mirror
called
for
something
to
drink
and
smoothed
out
the
incipient
wrinkles
of
care
he
walked
on
to
the
knap
with
a
quick
step
chapter
v
that
evening
sally
was
making
for
the
milkers
who
were
now
increased
by
two
for
her
mother
and
herself
no
longer
joined
in
milking
the
cows
themselves
but
upon
the
whole
there
was
little
change
in
the
household
economy
and
not
much
in
its
appearance
beyond
such
minor
particulars
as
that
the
crack
over
the
window
which
had
been
a
hundred
years
coming
was
a
trifle
wider
that
the
beams
were
a
shade
blacker
that
the
influence
of
modernism
had
supplanted
the
open
chimney
corner
by
a
grate
that
rebekah
who
had
worn
a
cap
when
she
had
plenty
of
hair
had
left
it
off
now
she
had
scarce
any
because
it
was
reported
that
caps
were
not
fashionable
and
that
sally
face
had
naturally
assumed
a
more
womanly
and
experienced
cast
hall
was
actually
lifting
coals
with
the
tongs
as
she
had
used
to
do
years
ago
this
very
night
if
i
am
not
mistaken
she
said
laying
on
an
ember
this
very
night
though
was
one
night
this
week
said
the
correct
sally
is
near
enough
five
years
ago
darton
came
to
marry
you
and
my
poor
boy
phil
came
home
to
die
she
sighed
sally
she
presently
said
you
had
managed
well
darton
would
have
had
you
helena
or
none
be
sentimental
about
that
mother
begged
sally
did
care
to
manage
well
in
such
a
case
though
i
liked
him
i
was
so
anxious
i
would
never
have
married
the
man
in
the
midst
of
such
a
hitch
as
that
was
she
added
with
decision
i
do
think
i
would
if
he
were
to
ask
me
now
am
not
sure
about
that
unless
you
have
another
in
your
eye
would
and
i
tell
you
why
i
could
hardly
marry
him
for
love
at
this
time
o
day
and
as
we
quite
enough
to
live
on
if
we
give
up
the
dairy
i
should
have
no
need
to
marry
for
any
meaner
reason
i
am
quite
happy
enough
as
i
am
and
there
an
end
of
it
now
it
was
not
long
after
this
dialogue
that
there
came
a
mild
rap
at
the
door
and
in
a
moment
there
entered
rebekah
looking
as
though
a
ghost
had
arrived
the
fact
was
that
that
accomplished
skimmer
and
churner
now
a
resident
in
the
house
had
overheard
the
desultory
observations
between
mother
and
daughter
and
on
opening
the
door
to
darton
thought
the
coincidence
must
have
a
grisly
meaning
in
it
hall
welcomed
the
farmer
with
warm
surprise
as
did
sally
and
for
a
moment
they
rather
wanted
words
you
push
up
the
for
me
mr
darton
the
notches
hitch
said
the
matron
he
did
it
and
the
homely
little
act
bridged
over
the
awkward
consciousness
that
he
had
been
a
stranger
for
four
years
hall
soon
saw
what
he
had
come
for
and
left
the
principals
together
while
she
went
to
prepare
him
a
late
tea
smiling
at
sally
recent
hasty
assertions
of
indifference
when
she
saw
how
civil
sally
was
when
tea
was
ready
she
joined
them
she
fancied
that
darton
did
not
look
so
confident
as
when
he
had
arrived
but
sally
was
quite
and
the
meal
passed
pleasantly
about
seven
he
took
his
leave
of
them
hall
went
as
far
as
the
door
to
light
him
down
the
slope
on
the
doorstep
he
said
frankly
came
to
ask
your
daughter
to
marry
me
chose
the
night
and
everything
with
an
eye
to
a
favourable
answer
but
she
wo
she
a
very
ungrateful
girl
emphatically
said
hall
darton
paused
to
shape
his
sentence
and
asked
i
suppose
nobody
else
more
favoured
ca
say
that
there
is
or
that
there
is
answered
hall
private
in
some
things
i
on
your
side
however
darton
and
i
talk
to
her
thank
said
the
farmer
in
a
gayer
accent
and
with
this
assurance
the
not
very
satisfactory
visit
came
to
an
end
darton
descended
the
roots
of
the
sycamore
the
light
was
withdrawn
and
the
door
closed
at
the
bottom
of
the
slope
he
nearly
ran
against
a
man
about
to
ascend
a
believe
his
few
senses
on
such
a
dark
night
or
he
exclaimed
one
whose
utterance
darton
recognized
in
a
moment
despite
its
unexpectedness
dare
not
swear
he
can
though
i
fain
would
the
speaker
was
johns
darton
said
he
was
glad
of
this
opportunity
bad
as
it
was
of
putting
an
end
to
the
silence
of
years
and
asked
the
dairyman
what
he
was
travelling
that
way
for
japheth
showed
the
old
jovial
confidence
in
a
moment
going
to
see
your
relations
as
they
always
seem
to
me
he
said
hall
and
sally
well
charles
the
fact
is
i
find
the
natural
barbarousness
of
man
is
much
increased
by
a
bachelor
life
and
as
your
leavings
were
always
good
enough
for
me
i
trying
civilization
here
he
nodded
towards
the
house
with
sally
to
marry
her
said
darton
feeling
something
like
a
rill
of
ice
water
between
his
shoulders
by
the
help
of
providence
and
my
personal
charms
and
i
think
i
shall
get
her
i
am
this
road
every
week
my
present
dairy
is
only
four
miles
off
you
know
and
i
see
her
through
the
window
is
rather
odd
that
i
was
going
to
speak
practical
to
her
for
the
first
time
you
just
called
for
a
short
while
but
she
did
say
a
word
about
you
good
sign
a
good
sign
now
that
decides
me
i
swing
the
mallet
and
get
her
answer
this
very
night
as
i
planned
a
few
more
remarks
and
darton
wishing
his
friend
joy
of
sally
in
a
slightly
hollow
tone
of
jocularity
bade
him
johns
promised
to
write
particulars
and
ascended
and
was
lost
in
the
shade
of
the
house
and
tree
a
rectangle
of
light
appeared
when
johns
was
admitted
and
all
was
dark
again
japheth
said
darton
then
is
the
explanation
he
determined
to
return
home
that
night
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
passed
out
of
the
village
and
the
next
day
went
about
his
and
storing
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
he
waited
and
waited
to
hear
from
johns
whether
the
was
fixed
but
no
letter
came
he
learnt
not
a
single
particular
till
meeting
johns
one
day
at
a
darton
exclaimed
genially
rather
more
genially
than
he
felt
is
the
joyful
day
to
be
to
his
great
surprise
a
reciprocity
of
gladness
was
not
conspicuous
in
johns
at
all
he
said
in
a
very
subdued

me
plainly

simply
annoying

to
ask
her
again
ah
charles
you
threw
a
prize
away
when
you
let
her
slip
five
years
ago
did

did
said
darton
he
returned
from
that
auction
with
a
new
set
of
feelings
in
play
he
had
certainly
made
a
surprising
mistake
in
thinking
johns
his
successful
rival
it
really
seemed
as
if
he
might
hope
for
sally
after
all
this
time
being
rather
pressed
by
business
darton
had
recourse
to
and
wrote
her
as
manly
and
straightforward
a
proposal
as
any
woman
could
wish
to
receive
the
reply
came
promptly
darton
i
am
as
sensible
as
any
woman
can
be
of
the
goodness
that
leads
you
to
make
me
this
offer
a
second
time
better
women
than
i
would
be
proud
of
the
honour
for
when
i
read
your
nice
long
speeches
on
and
such
like
topics
at
the
casterbridge
farmers
club
i
do
feel
it
an
honour
i
assure
you
but
my
answer
is
just
the
same
as
before
i
will
not
try
to
explain
what
in
truth
i
can
not
explain
my
reasons
i
will
simply
say
that
i
must
decline
to
be
married
to
you
with
good
wishes
as
in
former
times
i
am
your
faithful
friend
hall
darton
dropped
the
letter
hopelessly
beyond
the
negative
there
was
just
a
possibility
of
sarcasm
in
it
long
speeches
on
had
a
suspicious
sound
however
sarcasm
or
none
there
was
the
answer
and
he
had
to
be
content
he
proceeded
to
seek
relief
in
a
business
which
at
this
time
engrossed
much
of
his
attention
that
of
clearing
up
a
curious
mistake
just
current
in
the
county
that
he
had
been
nearly
ruined
by
the
recent
failure
of
a
local
bank
a
farmer
named
darton
had
lost
heavily
and
the
similarity
of
name
had
probably
led
to
the
error
belief
in
it
was
so
persistent
that
it
demanded
several
days
of
to
set
matters
straight
and
persuade
the
world
that
he
was
as
solvent
as
ever
he
had
been
in
his
life
he
had
hardly
concluded
this
worrying
task
when
to
his
delight
another
letter
arrived
in
the
handwriting
of
sally
darton
tore
it
open
it
was
very
short
darton
we
have
been
so
alarmed
these
last
few
days
by
the
report
that
you
were
ruined
by
the
stoppage
of
bank
that
now
it
is
contradicted
i
hasten
by
my
mother
wish
to
say
how
truly
glad
we
are
to
find
there
is
no
foundation
for
the
report
after
your
kindness
to
my
poor
brother
children
i
can
do
no
less
than
write
at
such
a
moment
we
had
a
letter
from
each
of
them
a
few
days
your
faithful
friend
hall
little
woman
said
darton
to
himself
with
a
smile
that
was
the
secret
of
her
refusal
this
time
she
thought
i
was
ruined
now
such
was
darton
that
as
hours
went
on
he
could
not
help
feeling
too
generously
towards
sally
to
condemn
her
in
this
what
did
he
want
in
a
wife
he
asked
himself
love
and
integrity
what
next
worldly
wisdom
and
was
there
really
more
than
worldly
wisdom
in
her
refusal
to
go
aboard
a
sinking
ship
she
now
knew
it
was
otherwise
he
said
try
her
again
the
fact
was
he
had
so
set
his
heart
upon
sally
and
sally
alone
that
nothing
was
to
be
allowed
to
baulk
him
and
his
reasoning
was
purely
formal
anniversaries
having
been
unpropitious
he
waited
on
till
a
bright
day
late
in
may
a
day
when
all
animate
nature
was
fancying
in
its
trusting
foolish
way
that
it
was
going
to
bask
out
of
doors
for
evermore
as
he
rode
through
lane
it
was
scarce
recognizable
as
the
track
of
his
two
winter
journeys
no
mistake
could
be
made
now
even
with
his
eyes
shut
the
cuckoo
note
was
at
its
best
between
april
tentativeness
and
midsummer
decrepitude
and
the
reptiles
in
the
sun
behaved
as
winningly
as
kittens
on
a
hearth
though
afternoon
and
about
the
same
time
as
on
the
last
occasion
it
was
broad
day
and
sunshine
when
he
entered
hintock
and
the
details
of
the
knap
were
visible
far
up
the
road
he
saw
sally
in
the
garden
and
was
set
vibrating
he
had
first
intended
to
go
on
to
the
inn
but
he
said
tie
my
horse
to
the
gate
if
all
goes
well
it
can
soon
be
taken
round
if
not
i
mount
and
ride
the
tall
shade
of
the
horseman
darkened
the
room
in
which
hall
sat
and
made
her
start
for
he
had
ridden
by
a
side
path
to
the
top
of
the
slope
where
riders
seldom
came
in
a
few
seconds
he
was
in
the
garden
with
sally
five
ay
three
minutes
did
the
business
at
the
back
of
that
row
of
bees
though
spring
had
come
and
heavenly
blue
consecrated
the
scene
darton
succeeded
not
said
sally
firmly
will
never
never
marry
you
darton
i
would
have
done
it
once
but
now
i
never
can
implored
darton
and
with
a
burst
of
real
eloquence
he
went
on
to
declare
all
sorts
of
things
that
he
would
do
for
her
he
would
drive
her
to
see
her
mother
every
week
take
her
to
london
settle
so
much
money
upon
her
heaven
knows
what
he
did
not
promise
suggest
and
tempt
her
with
but
it
availed
nothing
she
interposed
with
a
stout
negative
which
closed
the
course
of
his
argument
like
an
iron
gate
across
a
highway
darton
paused
said
he
simply
had
heard
of
my
supposed
failure
when
you
declined
last
time
had
not
she
said
if
i
had
have
been
all
the
same
is
not
because
of
any
soreness
from
my
slighting
you
years
ago
that
soreness
is
long
past
then
you
despise
me
sally
she
slowly
answered
do
altogether
despise
you
i
think
you
quite
such
a
hero
as
i
once
did
that
all
the
truth
is
i
am
happy
enough
as
i
am
and
i
do
mean
to
marry
at
all
now
may
i
ask
a
favour
sir
she
spoke
with
an
ineffable
charm
which
whenever
he
thought
of
it
made
him
curse
his
loss
of
her
as
long
as
he
lived
any
extent
do
not
put
this
question
to
me
any
more
friends
as
long
as
you
like
but
lovers
and
married
never
never
will
said
darton
if
i
live
a
hundred
years
and
he
never
did
that
he
had
worn
out
his
welcome
in
her
heart
was
only
too
plain
when
his
had
grown
up
and
were
placed
out
in
life
all
communication
between
darton
and
the
hall
family
ceased
it
was
only
by
chance
that
years
after
he
learnt
that
sally
notwithstanding
the
solicitations
her
attractions
drew
down
upon
her
had
refused
several
offers
of
marriage
and
steadily
adhered
to
her
purpose
of
leading
a
single
life
may
the
distracted
preacher
chapter
i
how
his
cold
was
cured
something
delayed
the
arrival
of
the
wesleyan
minister
and
a
young
man
came
temporarily
in
his
stead
it
was
on
the
thirteenth
of
january
that
stockdale
the
young
man
in
question
made
his
humble
entry
into
the
village
unknown
and
almost
unseen
but
when
those
of
the
inhabitants
who
styled
themselves
of
his
connection
became
acquainted
with
him
they
were
rather
pleased
with
the
substitute
than
otherwise
though
he
had
scarcely
as
yet
acquired
ballast
of
character
sufficient
to
steady
the
consciences
of
the
methodists
of
pure
blood
who
at
this
time
lived
in
and
to
give
in
addition
supplementary
support
to
the
mixed
race
which
went
to
church
in
the
morning
and
chapel
in
the
evening
or
when
there
was
a
tea
as
many
as
a
people
more
all
told
and
including
the
in
the
when
it
was
too
dark
for
the
vicar
to
observe
who
passed
up
the
street
at
seven
which
to
be
just
to
him
he
was
never
anxious
to
do
it
was
owing
to
this
overlapping
of
creeds
that
the
celebrated
puzzle
arose
among
the
denser
gentry
of
the
district
around
how
could
it
be
that
a
parish
containing
fifteen
score
of
strong
episcopalians
and
nearly
thirteen
score
of
dissenters
numbered
barely
score
adults
in
all
the
young
man
being
personally
interesting
those
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
were
content
to
waive
for
a
while
the
graver
question
of
his
sufficiency
it
is
said
that
at
this
time
of
his
life
his
eyes
were
affectionate
though
without
a
ray
of
levity
that
his
hair
was
curly
and
his
figure
tall
that
he
was
in
short
a
very
lovable
youth
who
won
upon
his
female
hearers
as
soon
as
they
saw
and
heard
him
and
caused
them
to
say
did
we
know
of
this
before
he
came
that
we
might
have
gied
him
a
warmer
welcome
the
fact
was
that
knowing
him
to
be
only
provisionally
selected
and
expecting
nothing
remarkable
in
his
person
or
doctrine
they
and
the
rest
of
his
flock
in
had
felt
almost
as
indifferent
about
his
advent
as
if
they
had
been
the
soundest
parishioners
in
the
country
and
he
their
true
and
appointed
parson
thus
when
stockdale
set
foot
in
the
place
nobody
had
secured
a
lodging
for
him
and
though
his
journey
had
given
him
a
bad
cold
in
the
head
he
was
forced
to
attend
to
that
business
himself
on
inquiry
he
learnt
that
the
only
possible
accommodation
in
the
village
would
be
found
at
the
house
of
one
lizzy
newberry
at
the
upper
end
of
the
street
it
was
a
youth
who
gave
this
information
and
stockdale
asked
him
who
newberry
might
be
the
boy
said
that
she
was
a
who
had
got
no
husband
because
he
was
dead
newberry
he
added
had
been
a
man
enough
as
the
saying
was
and
a
farmer
but
he
had
gone
off
in
a
decline
as
regarded
newberry
serious
side
stockdale
gathered
that
she
was
one
of
the
trimmers
who
went
to
church
and
chapel
both
go
there
said
stockdale
feeling
that
in
the
absence
of
purely
sectarian
lodgings
he
could
do
no
better
a
little
particular
and
wo
hae
folks
or
curates
or
the
friends
or
such
like
said
the
lad
dubiously
that
may
be
a
promising
sign
i
call
or
no
just
you
go
up
and
ask
first
if
she
can
find
room
for
me
i
have
to
see
one
or
two
persons
on
another
matter
you
will
find
me
down
at
the
carrier
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
lad
came
back
and
said
that
newberry
would
have
no
objection
to
accommodate
him
whereupon
stockdale
called
at
the
house
it
stood
within
a
and
seemed
to
be
roomy
and
comfortable
he
saw
an
elderly
woman
with
whom
he
made
arrangements
to
come
the
same
night
since
there
was
no
inn
in
the
place
and
he
wished
to
house
himself
as
soon
as
possible
the
village
being
a
local
centre
from
which
he
was
to
radiate
at
once
to
the
different
small
chapels
in
the
neighbourhood
he
forthwith
sent
his
luggage
to
newberry
from
the
carrier
where
he
had
taken
shelter
and
in
the
evening
walked
up
to
his
temporary
home
as
he
now
lived
there
stockdale
felt
it
unnecessary
to
knock
at
the
door
and
entering
quietly
he
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
footsteps
scudding
away
like
mice
into
the
back
quarters
he
advanced
to
the
parlour
as
the
front
room
was
called
though
its
stone
floor
was
scarcely
disguised
by
the
carpet
which
only
the
trodden
areas
leaving
sandy
deserts
under
the
bulging
mouldings
of
the
playing
with
brass
furniture
but
the
room
looked
snug
and
cheerful
the
firelight
shone
out
brightly
trembling
on
the
knobs
and
handles
and
lurking
in
great
strength
on
the
under
surface
of
the
a
deep
covered
with
horsehair
and
studded
with
a
countless
throng
of
brass
nails
was
pulled
up
on
one
side
of
the
fireplace
the
were
on
the
table
the
teapot
cover
was
open
and
a
little
had
been
laid
at
that
precise
point
towards
which
a
person
seated
in
the
great
chair
might
be
expected
instinctively
to
stretch
his
hand
stockdale
sat
down
not
objecting
to
his
experience
of
the
room
thus
far
and
began
his
residence
by
tinkling
the
bell
a
little
girl
crept
in
at
the
summons
and
made
tea
for
him
her
name
she
said
was
marther
sarer
and
she
lived
out
there
nodding
towards
the
road
and
village
generally
before
stockdale
had
got
far
with
his
meal
a
tap
sounded
on
the
door
behind
him
and
on
his
telling
the
inquirer
to
come
in
a
rustle
of
garments
caused
him
to
turn
his
head
he
saw
before
him
a
fine
and
extremely
young
woman
with
dark
hair
a
wide
sensible
beautiful
forehead
eyes
that
warmed
him
before
he
knew
it
and
a
mouth
that
was
in
itself
a
picture
to
all
appreciative
souls
i
get
you
anything
else
for
tea
she
said
coming
forward
a
step
or
two
an
expression
of
liveliness
on
her
features
and
her
hand
waving
the
door
by
its
edge
thank
you
said
stockdale
thinking
less
of
what
he
replied
than
of
what
might
be
her
relation
to
the
household
are
quite
sure
said
the
young
woman
apparently
aware
that
he
had
not
considered
his
answer
he
conscientiously
examined
the
and
found
them
all
there
sure
miss
newberry
he
said
is
newberry
she
said
newberry
i
used
to
be
lizzy
simpkins
i
beg
your
pardon
mrs
newberry
and
before
he
had
occasion
to
say
more
she
left
the
room
stockdale
remained
in
some
doubt
till
martha
sarah
came
to
clear
the
table
house
is
this
my
little
woman
said
he
lizzy
newberry
sir
newberry
is
not
the
old
lady
i
saw
this
afternoon
that
newberry
mother
it
was
newberry
who
comed
in
to
you
just
by
now
because
she
wanted
to
see
if
you
was
later
in
the
evening
when
stockdale
was
about
to
begin
supper
she
came
again
have
come
myself
stockdale
she
said
the
minister
stood
up
in
acknowledgment
of
the
honour
am
afraid
little
marther
might
not
make
you
understand
what
will
you
have
for
supper
cold
rabbit
and
there
a
ham
uncut
stockdale
said
he
could
get
on
nicely
with
those
viands
and
supper
was
laid
he
had
no
more
than
cut
a
slice
when
came
to
the
door
again
the
minister
had
already
learnt
that
this
particular
rhythm
in
taps
denoted
the
fingers
of
his
enkindling
landlady
and
the
doomed
young
fellow
buried
his
first
mouthful
under
a
look
of
receptive
blandness
have
a
chicken
in
the
house
stockdale
i
quite
forgot
to
mention
it
just
now
perhaps
you
would
like
marther
sarer
to
bring
it
up
stockdale
had
advanced
far
enough
in
the
art
of
being
a
young
man
to
say
that
he
did
not
want
the
chicken
unless
she
brought
it
up
herself
but
when
it
was
uttered
he
blushed
at
the
daring
gallantry
of
the
speech
perhaps
a
shade
too
strong
for
a
serious
man
and
a
minister
in
three
minutes
the
chicken
appeared
but
to
his
great
surprise
only
in
the
hands
of
martha
sarah
stockdale
was
disappointed
which
perhaps
it
was
intended
that
he
should
be
he
had
finished
supper
and
was
not
in
the
least
anticipating
newberry
again
that
night
when
she
tapped
and
entered
as
before
stockdale
gratified
look
told
that
she
had
lost
nothing
by
not
appearing
when
expected
it
happened
that
the
cold
in
the
head
from
which
the
young
man
suffered
had
increased
with
the
approach
of
night
and
before
she
had
spoken
he
was
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
sneezing
which
he
could
not
anyhow
repress
newberry
looked
full
of
pity
cold
is
very
bad
mr
stockdale
stockdale
replied
that
it
was
rather
troublesome
i
a
good
mind
she
added
archly
looking
at
the
cheerless
glass
of
water
on
the
table
which
the
abstemious
minister
was
going
to
drink
mrs
newberry
a
good
mind
that
you
should
have
something
more
likely
to
cure
it
than
that
cold
stuff
said
stockdale
looking
down
at
the
glass
there
is
no
inn
here
and
nothing
better
to
be
got
in
the
village
of
course
it
will
do
to
this
she
replied
is
something
better
not
far
off
though
not
in
the
house
i
really
think
you
must
try
it
or
you
may
be
ill
yes
stockdale
you
shall
she
held
up
her
finger
seeing
that
he
was
about
to
speak
ask
what
it
is
wait
and
you
shall
see
lizzy
went
away
and
stockdale
waited
in
a
pleasant
mood
presently
she
returned
with
her
bonnet
and
cloak
on
saying
am
so
sorry
but
you
must
help
me
to
get
it
mother
has
gone
to
bed
will
you
wrap
yourself
up
and
come
this
way
and
please
bring
that
cup
with
you
stockdale
a
lonely
young
fellow
who
had
for
weeks
felt
a
great
craving
for
somebody
on
whom
to
throw
away
superfluous
interest
and
even
tenderness
was
not
sorry
to
join
her
and
followed
his
guide
through
the
back
door
across
the
garden
to
the
bottom
where
the
boundary
was
a
wall
this
wall
was
low
and
beyond
it
stockdale
discerned
in
the
night
shades
several
grey
headstones
and
the
outlines
of
the
church
roof
and
tower
is
easy
to
get
up
this
way
she
said
stepping
upon
a
bank
which
abutted
on
the
wall
then
putting
her
foot
on
the
top
of
the
stonework
and
descending
a
spring
inside
where
the
ground
was
much
higher
as
is
the
manner
of
graveyards
to
be
stockdale
did
the
same
and
followed
her
in
the
dusk
across
the
irregular
ground
till
they
came
to
the
tower
door
which
when
they
had
entered
she
softly
closed
behind
them
can
keep
a
secret
she
said
in
a
musical
voice
an
iron
chest
said
he
fervently
then
from
under
her
cloak
she
produced
a
small
lighted
lantern
which
the
minister
had
not
noticed
that
she
carried
at
all
the
light
showed
them
to
be
close
to
the
stairs
under
which
lay
a
heap
of
lumber
of
all
sorts
but
consisting
mostly
of
decayed
framework
pews
panels
and
pieces
of
flooring
that
from
time
to
time
had
been
removed
from
their
original
fixings
in
the
body
of
the
edifice
and
replaced
by
new
you
will
drag
some
of
those
boards
aside
she
said
holding
the
lantern
over
her
head
to
light
him
better
will
you
take
the
lantern
while
i
move
them
can
manage
it
said
the
young
man
and
acting
as
she
ordered
he
uncovered
to
his
surprise
a
row
of
little
barrels
bound
with
wood
hoops
each
barrel
being
about
as
large
as
the
nave
of
a
heavy
wheel
when
they
were
laid
open
lizzy
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
as
if
she
wondered
what
he
would
say
know
what
they
are
she
asked
finding
that
he
did
not
speak
barrels
said
stockdale
simply
he
was
an
inland
man
the
son
of
highly
respectable
parents
and
brought
up
with
a
single
eye
to
the
ministry
and
the
sight
suggested
nothing
beyond
the
fact
that
such
articles
were
there
are
quite
right
they
are
barrels
she
said
in
an
emphatic
tone
of
candour
that
was
not
without
a
touch
of
irony
stockdale
looked
at
her
with
an
eye
of
sudden
misgiving
liquor
he
said
said
she
are
tubs
of
spirit
that
have
accidentally
come
over
in
the
dark
from
france
in
and
its
vicinity
at
this
date
people
always
smiled
at
the
sort
of
sin
called
in
the
outside
world
illicit
trading
and
these
little
kegs
of
gin
and
brandy
were
as
well
known
to
the
inhabitants
as
turnips
so
that
stockdale
innocent
ignorance
and
his
look
of
alarm
when
he
guessed
the
sinister
mystery
seemed
to
strike
lizzy
first
as
ludicrous
and
then
as
very
awkward
for
the
good
impression
that
she
wished
to
produce
upon
him
is
carried
on
here
by
some
of
the
people
she
said
in
a
gentle
apologetic
voice
has
been
their
practice
for
generations
and
they
think
it
no
harm
now
will
you
roll
out
one
of
the
tubs
to
do
with
it
said
the
minister
draw
a
little
from
it
to
cure
your
cold
she
answered
is
so
strong
that
it
drives
away
that
sort
of
thing
in
a
jiffy
o
it
is
all
right
about
our
taking
it
i
may
have
what
i
like
the
owner
of
the
tubs
says
so
i
ought
to
have
had
some
in
the
house
and
then
i
should
ha
been
put
to
this
trouble
but
i
drink
none
myself
and
so
i
often
forget
to
keep
it
indoors
are
allowed
to
help
yourself
i
suppose
that
you
may
not
inform
where
their
is
no
not
that
particularly
but
i
may
take
any
if
i
want
it
so
help
yourself
will
to
oblige
you
since
you
have
a
right
to
it
murmured
the
minister
and
though
he
was
not
quite
satisfied
with
his
part
in
the
performance
he
rolled
one
of
the
out
from
the
corner
into
the
middle
of
the
tower
floor
do
you
wish
me
to
get
it
out
with
a
gimlet
i
suppose
i
show
you
said
his
interesting
companion
and
she
held
up
with
her
other
hand
a
shoemaker
awl
and
a
hammer
must
never
do
these
things
with
a
gimlet
because
the
gets
in
and
when
the
buyers
pour
out
the
brandy
that
would
tell
them
that
the
tub
had
been
broached
an
awl
makes
no
dust
and
the
hole
nearly
closes
up
again
now
tap
one
of
the
hoops
forward
stockdale
took
the
hammer
and
did
so
make
the
hole
in
the
part
that
was
covered
by
the
hoop
he
made
the
hole
as
directed
wo
run
out
he
said
yes
it
will
said
she
the
tub
between
your
knees
and
squeeze
the
heads
and
i
hold
the
cup
stockdale
obeyed
and
the
pressure
taking
effect
upon
the
tub
which
seemed
to
be
thin
the
spirit
spirted
out
in
a
stream
when
the
cup
was
full
he
ceased
pressing
and
the
flow
immediately
stopped
we
must
fill
up
the
keg
with
water
said
lizzy
it
will
cluck
like
forty
hens
when
it
is
handled
and
show
that
is
not
full
they
tell
you
you
may
take
it
the
smugglers
but
the
buyers
must
not
know
that
the
smugglers
have
been
kind
to
me
at
their
expense
see
said
stockdale
doubtfully
much
question
the
honesty
of
this
proceeding
by
her
direction
he
held
the
tub
with
the
hole
upwards
and
while
he
went
through
the
process
of
alternately
pressing
and
ceasing
to
press
she
produced
a
bottle
of
water
from
which
she
took
mouthfuls
conveying
each
to
the
keg
by
putting
her
pretty
lips
to
the
hole
where
it
was
sucked
in
at
each
recovery
of
the
cask
from
pressure
when
it
was
again
full
he
plugged
the
hole
knocked
the
hoop
down
to
its
place
and
buried
the
tub
in
the
lumber
as
before
the
smugglers
afraid
that
you
will
tell
he
asked
as
they
recrossed
the
churchyard
no
they
are
not
afraid
of
that
i
could
do
such
a
thing
have
put
you
into
a
very
awkward
corner
said
stockdale
emphatically
must
of
course
as
an
honest
person
sometimes
feel
that
it
is
your
duty
to
inform
really
you
must
i
have
never
particularly
felt
it
as
a
duty
and
besides
my
first
husband
she
stopped
and
there
was
some
confusion
in
her
voice
stockdale
was
so
honest
and
unsophisticated
that
he
did
not
at
once
discern
why
she
paused
but
at
last
he
did
perceive
that
the
words
were
a
slip
and
that
no
woman
would
have
uttered
husband
by
accident
unless
she
had
thought
pretty
frequently
of
a
second
he
felt
for
her
confusion
and
allowed
her
time
to
recover
and
proceed
husband
she
said
in
a
tone
to
know
of
their
doings
and
so
did
my
father
and
kept
the
secret
i
can
not
inform
in
fact
against
anybody
see
the
hardness
of
it
he
continued
like
a
man
who
looked
far
into
the
moral
of
things
it
is
very
cruel
that
you
should
be
tossed
and
tantalized
between
your
memories
and
your
conscience
i
do
hope
newberry
that
you
will
soon
see
your
way
out
of
this
unpleasant
position
i
do
just
now
she
murmured
by
this
time
they
had
passed
over
the
wall
and
entered
the
house
where
she
brought
him
a
glass
and
hot
water
and
left
him
to
his
own
reflections
he
looked
after
her
vanishing
form
asking
himself
whether
he
as
a
respectable
man
and
a
minister
and
a
shining
light
even
though
as
yet
only
of
the
sort
were
quite
justified
in
doing
this
thing
a
sneeze
settled
the
question
and
he
found
that
when
the
fiery
liquor
was
lowered
by
the
addition
of
twice
or
thrice
the
quantity
of
water
it
was
one
of
the
prettiest
cures
for
a
cold
in
the
head
that
he
had
ever
known
particularly
at
this
chilly
time
of
the
year
stockdale
sat
in
the
deep
chair
about
twenty
minutes
sipping
and
meditating
till
he
at
length
took
warmer
views
of
things
and
longed
for
the
morrow
when
he
would
see
newberry
again
he
then
felt
that
though
chronologically
at
a
short
distance
it
would
in
an
emotional
sense
be
very
long
before
came
and
walked
restlessly
round
the
room
his
eye
was
attracted
by
a
framed
and
glazed
sampler
in
which
a
running
ornament
of
and
peacocks
surrounded
the
following
pretty
bit
of
sentiment
smell
when
roses
thrive
here
my
work
while
i
alive
smell
when
shrunk
and
shed
here
my
work
when
i
am
dead
simpkins
fear
god
honour
the
king
years
hers
he
said
to
himself
how
i
like
that
name
before
he
had
done
thinking
that
no
other
name
from
abigail
to
zenobia
would
have
suited
his
young
landlady
so
well
came
again
upon
the
door
and
the
minister
started
as
her
face
appeared
yet
another
time
looking
so
disinterested
that
the
most
ingenious
would
have
refrained
from
asserting
that
she
had
come
to
affect
his
feelings
by
her
seductive
eyes
you
like
a
fire
in
your
room
stockdale
on
account
of
your
cold
the
minister
being
still
a
little
pricked
in
the
conscience
for
countenancing
her
in
watering
the
spirits
saw
here
a
way
to
i
thank
you
he
said
firmly
is
not
necessary
i
have
never
been
used
to
one
in
my
life
and
it
would
be
giving
way
to
luxury
too
far
i
wo
insist
she
said
and
disconcerted
him
by
vanishing
instantly
wondering
if
she
was
vexed
by
his
refusal
he
wished
that
he
had
chosen
to
have
a
fire
even
though
it
should
have
scorched
him
out
of
bed
and
endangered
his
for
a
dozen
days
however
he
consoled
himself
with
what
was
in
truth
a
rare
consolation
for
a
budding
lover
that
he
was
under
the
same
roof
with
lizzy
her
guest
in
fact
to
take
a
poetical
view
of
the
term
lodger
and
that
he
would
certainly
see
her
on
the
morrow
the
morrow
came
and
stockdale
rose
early
his
cold
quite
gone
he
had
never
in
his
life
so
longed
for
the
breakfast
hour
as
he
did
that
day
and
punctually
at
eight
after
a
short
walk
to
reconnoitre
the
premises
he
the
door
of
his
dwelling
breakfast
passed
and
martha
sarah
attended
but
nobody
came
voluntarily
as
on
the
night
before
to
inquire
if
there
were
other
wants
which
he
had
not
mentioned
and
which
she
would
attempt
to
gratify
he
was
disappointed
and
went
out
hoping
to
see
her
at
dinner
dinner
time
came
he
sat
down
to
the
meal
finished
it
lingered
on
for
a
whole
hour
although
two
new
teachers
were
at
that
moment
waiting
at
the
to
speak
to
him
by
appointment
it
was
useless
to
wait
longer
and
he
slowly
went
his
way
down
the
lane
cheered
by
the
thought
that
after
all
he
would
see
her
in
the
evening
and
perhaps
engage
again
in
the
delightful
in
the
neighbouring
church
tower
which
proceeding
he
resolved
to
render
more
moral
by
steadfastly
insisting
that
no
water
should
be
introduced
to
fill
up
though
the
tub
should
cluck
like
all
the
hens
in
christendom
but
nothing
could
disguise
the
fact
that
it
was
a
queer
business
and
his
countenance
fell
when
he
thought
how
much
more
his
mind
was
interested
in
that
matter
than
in
his
serious
duties
however
compunction
vanished
with
the
decline
of
day
night
came
and
his
tea
and
supper
but
no
lizzy
newberry
and
no
sweet
temptations
at
last
the
minister
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
said
to
his
quaint
little
attendant
is
newberry
judiciously
handing
a
penny
as
he
spoke
busy
said
martha
serious
happened
he
asked
handing
another
penny
and
revealing
yet
additional
pennies
in
the
background
no
nothing
at
all
said
she
with
breathless
confidence
ever
happens
to
her
she
only
biding
upstairs
in
bed
because
is
her
way
sometimes
being
a
young
man
of
some
honour
he
would
not
question
further
and
assuming
that
lizzy
must
have
a
bad
headache
or
other
slight
ailment
in
spite
of
what
the
girl
had
said
he
went
to
bed
dissatisfied
not
even
setting
eyes
on
old
simpkins
said
last
night
that
i
should
see
her
he
reflected
that
was
not
to
be
next
day
he
had
better
fortune
or
worse
meeting
her
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
in
the
morning
and
being
favoured
by
a
visit
or
two
from
her
during
the
day
once
for
the
purpose
of
making
kindly
inquiries
about
his
comfort
as
on
the
first
evening
and
at
another
time
to
place
a
bunch
of
on
his
table
with
a
promise
to
renew
them
when
they
drooped
on
these
occasions
there
was
something
in
her
smile
which
showed
how
conscious
she
was
of
the
effect
she
produced
though
it
must
be
said
that
it
was
rather
a
humorous
than
a
designing
consciousness
and
savoured
more
of
pride
than
of
vanity
as
for
stockdale
he
clearly
perceived
that
he
possessed
unlimited
capacity
for
backsliding
and
wished
that
tutelary
saints
were
not
denied
to
dissenters
he
set
a
watch
upon
his
tongue
and
eyes
for
the
space
of
one
hour
and
a
half
after
which
he
found
it
was
useless
to
struggle
further
and
gave
himself
up
to
the
situation
other
minister
will
be
here
in
a
month
he
said
to
himself
when
sitting
over
the
fire
i
shall
be
off
and
she
will
distract
my
mind
no
more
and
then
shall
i
go
on
living
by
myself
for
ever
no
when
my
two
years
of
probation
are
finished
i
shall
have
a
furnished
house
to
live
in
with
a
varnished
door
and
a
brass
knocker
and
i
march
straight
back
to
her
and
ask
her
flat
as
soon
as
the
last
plate
is
on
the
dresser
thus
a
titillating
fortnight
was
passed
by
young
stockdale
during
which
time
things
proceeded
much
as
such
matters
have
done
ever
since
the
beginning
of
history
he
saw
the
object
of
attachment
several
times
one
day
did
not
see
her
at
all
the
next
met
her
when
he
least
expected
to
do
so
missed
her
when
hints
and
signs
as
to
where
she
should
be
at
a
given
hour
almost
amounted
to
an
appointment
this
mild
coquetry
was
perhaps
fair
enough
under
the
circumstances
of
their
being
so
closely
lodged
and
stockdale
put
up
with
it
as
philosophically
as
he
was
able
being
in
her
own
house
she
could
after
vexing
him
or
disappointing
him
of
her
presence
easily
win
him
back
by
suddenly
surrounding
him
with
those
little
attentions
which
her
position
as
his
landlady
put
it
in
her
power
to
bestow
when
he
had
waited
indoors
half
the
day
to
see
her
and
on
finding
that
she
would
not
be
seen
had
gone
off
in
a
huff
to
the
dreariest
and
dampest
walk
he
could
discover
she
would
restore
equilibrium
in
the
evening
with
stockdale
i
have
fancied
you
must
feel
draught
o
nights
from
your
bedroom
window
and
so
i
have
been
putting
up
thicker
curtains
this
afternoon
while
you
were
out
or
noticed
that
you
sneezed
twice
again
this
morning
stockdale
depend
upon
it
that
cold
is
hanging
about
you
yet
i
am
sure
it
is
i
have
thought
of
it
continually
and
you
must
let
me
make
a
posset
for
you
sometimes
in
coming
home
he
found
his
rearranged
chairs
placed
where
the
table
had
stood
and
the
table
ornamented
with
the
few
fresh
flowers
and
leaves
that
could
be
obtained
at
this
season
so
as
to
add
a
novelty
to
the
room
at
times
she
would
be
standing
on
a
chair
outside
the
house
trying
to
nail
up
a
branch
of
the
monthly
rose
which
the
winter
wind
had
blown
down
and
of
course
he
stepped
forward
to
assist
her
when
their
hands
got
mixed
in
passing
the
shreds
and
nails
thus
they
became
friends
again
after
a
disagreement
she
would
utter
on
these
occasions
some
pretty
and
deprecatory
remark
on
the
necessity
of
her
troubling
him
anew
and
he
would
straightway
say
that
he
would
do
a
hundred
times
as
much
for
her
if
she
should
so
require
chapter
ii
how
he
saw
two
other
men
matters
being
in
this
advancing
state
stockdale
was
rather
surprised
one
cloudy
evening
while
sitting
in
his
room
at
hearing
her
speak
in
low
tones
of
expostulation
to
some
one
at
the
door
it
was
nearly
dark
but
the
shutters
were
not
yet
closed
nor
the
candles
lighted
and
stockdale
was
tempted
to
stretch
his
head
towards
the
window
he
saw
outside
the
door
a
young
man
in
clothes
of
a
whitish
colour
and
upon
reflection
judged
their
wearer
to
be
the
and
rather
handsome
miller
who
lived
below
the
miller
voice
was
alternately
low
and
firm
and
sometimes
it
reached
the
level
of
positive
entreaty
but
what
the
words
were
stockdale
could
in
no
way
hear
before
the
colloquy
had
ended
the
minister
attention
was
attracted
by
a
second
incident
opposite
lizzy
home
grew
a
clump
of
laurels
forming
a
thick
and
permanent
shade
one
of
the
laurel
boughs
now
quivered
against
the
light
background
of
sky
and
in
a
moment
the
head
of
a
man
peered
out
and
remained
still
he
seemed
to
be
also
much
interested
in
the
conversation
at
the
door
and
was
plainly
lingering
there
to
watch
and
listen
had
stockdale
stood
in
any
other
relation
to
lizzy
than
that
of
a
lover
he
might
have
gone
out
and
investigated
the
meaning
of
this
but
being
as
yet
but
an
unprivileged
ally
he
did
nothing
more
than
stand
up
and
show
himself
against
the
firelight
whereupon
the
listener
disappeared
and
lizzy
and
the
miller
spoke
in
lower
tones
stockdale
was
made
so
uneasy
by
the
circumstance
that
as
soon
as
the
miller
was
gone
he
said
newberry
are
you
aware
that
you
were
watched
just
now
and
your
conversation
heard
she
said
you
were
talking
to
that
miller
a
man
was
looking
from
the
tree
as
jealously
as
if
he
could
have
eaten
you
she
showed
more
concern
than
the
trifling
event
seemed
to
demand
and
he
added
you
were
talking
of
things
you
did
not
wish
to
be
overheard
was
talking
only
on
business
she
said
be
frank
said
the
young
man
it
was
only
on
business
why
should
anybody
wish
to
listen
to
you
she
looked
curiously
at
him
else
do
you
think
it
could
be
then
the
only
talk
between
a
young
woman
and
man
that
is
likely
to
amuse
an
eavesdropper
yes
she
said
smiling
in
spite
of
her
preoccupation
my
cousin
owlett
has
spoken
to
me
about
matrimony
every
now
and
then
that
true
but
he
was
not
speaking
of
it
then
i
wish
he
had
been
speaking
of
it
with
all
my
heart
it
would
have
been
much
less
serious
for
me
mrs
newberry
would
not
that
i
should
ha
chimed
in
with
him
of
course
i
wish
it
for
other
reasons
i
am
glad
stockdale
that
you
have
told
me
of
that
listener
it
is
a
timely
warning
and
i
must
see
my
cousin
again
do
go
away
till
i
have
spoken
said
the
minister
out
with
it
at
once
and
make
no
more
ado
let
it
be
yes
or
no
between
us
lizzy
please
do
and
he
held
out
his
hand
in
which
she
freely
allowed
her
own
to
rest
but
without
speaking
mean
yes
by
that
he
asked
after
waiting
a
while
may
be
my
sweetheart
if
you
will
not
say
at
once
you
will
wait
for
me
until
i
have
a
house
and
can
come
back
to
marry
you
i
am
thinking
thinking
of
something
else
she
said
with
embarrassment
all
comes
upon
me
at
once
and
i
must
settle
one
thing
at
a
time
any
rate
dear
lizzy
you
can
assure
me
that
the
miller
shall
not
be
allowed
to
speak
to
you
except
on
business
you
have
never
directly
encouraged
him
she
parried
the
question
by
saying
see
he
and
his
party
have
been
in
the
habit
of
leaving
things
on
my
premises
sometimes
and
as
i
have
not
denied
him
it
makes
him
rather
forward
what
things
they
are
called
things
here
why
do
you
deny
him
my
dear
lizzy
can
not
well
are
too
timid
it
is
unfair
of
him
to
impose
so
upon
you
and
get
your
good
name
into
danger
by
his
smuggling
tricks
promise
me
that
the
next
time
he
wants
to
leave
his
tubs
here
you
will
let
me
roll
them
into
the
street
she
shook
her
head
would
not
venture
to
offend
the
neighbours
so
much
as
that
said
she
do
anything
that
would
be
so
likely
to
put
poor
owlett
into
the
hands
of
the
excisemen
stockdale
sighed
and
said
that
he
thought
hers
a
mistaken
generosity
when
it
extended
to
assisting
those
who
cheated
the
king
of
his
dues
any
rate
you
will
let
me
make
him
keep
his
distance
as
your
lover
and
tell
him
flatly
that
you
are
not
for
him
not
at
present
she
said
do
wish
to
offend
my
old
neighbours
it
is
not
only
owlett
who
is
concerned
is
too
bad
said
stockdale
impatiently
my
honour
i
wo
encourage
him
as
my
lover
lizzy
answered
earnestly
reasonable
man
will
be
satisfied
with
that
so
i
am
said
stockdale
his
countenance
clearing
chapter
iii
the
mysterious
greatcoat
stockdale
now
began
to
notice
more
particularly
a
feature
in
the
life
of
his
fair
landlady
which
he
had
casually
observed
but
scarcely
ever
thought
of
before
it
was
that
she
was
markedly
irregular
in
her
hours
of
rising
for
a
week
or
two
she
would
be
tolerably
punctual
reaching
the
within
a
few
minutes
of
seven
then
suddenly
she
would
not
be
visible
till
twelve
at
noon
perhaps
for
three
or
four
days
in
succession
and
twice
he
had
certain
proof
that
she
did
not
leave
her
room
till
three
in
the
afternoon
the
second
time
that
this
extreme
lateness
came
under
his
notice
was
on
a
day
when
he
had
particularly
wished
to
consult
with
her
about
his
future
movements
and
he
concluded
as
he
always
had
done
that
she
had
a
cold
headache
or
other
ailment
unless
she
had
kept
herself
invisible
to
avoid
meeting
and
talking
to
him
which
he
could
hardly
believe
the
former
supposition
was
disproved
however
by
her
innocently
saying
some
days
later
when
they
were
speaking
on
a
question
of
health
that
she
had
never
had
a
moment
heaviness
headache
or
illness
of
any
kind
since
the
previous
january
twelvemonth
am
glad
to
hear
it
said
he
thought
quite
otherwise
do
i
look
sickly
she
asked
turning
up
her
face
to
show
the
impossibility
of
his
gazing
on
it
and
holding
such
a
belief
for
a
moment
at
all
i
merely
thought
so
from
your
being
sometimes
obliged
to
keep
your
room
through
the
best
part
of
the
day
as
for
that
it
means
nothing
she
murmured
with
a
look
which
some
might
have
called
cold
and
which
was
the
worst
look
that
he
liked
to
see
upon
her
is
pure
sleepiness
mr
stockdale
is
i
tell
you
when
i
stay
in
my
room
till
three
in
the
afternoon
you
may
always
be
sure
that
i
slept
soundly
till
three
or
i
should
have
stayed
there
is
dreadful
said
stockdale
thinking
of
the
disastrous
effects
of
such
indulgence
upon
the
household
of
a
minister
should
it
become
a
habit
of
everyday
occurrence
then
she
said
divining
his
good
and
prescient
thoughts
only
happens
when
i
stay
awake
all
night
i
do
go
to
sleep
till
five
or
six
in
the
morning
sometimes
that
another
matter
said
stockdale
to
such
an
alarming
extent
is
real
illness
have
you
spoken
to
a
doctor
no
there
is
no
need
for
doing
that
it
is
all
natural
to
me
and
she
went
away
without
further
remark
stockdale
might
have
waited
a
long
time
to
know
the
real
cause
of
her
sleeplessness
had
it
not
happened
that
one
dark
night
he
was
sitting
in
his
bedroom
jotting
down
notes
for
a
sermon
which
occupied
him
perfunctorily
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
other
members
of
the
household
had
retired
he
did
not
get
to
bed
till
one
before
he
had
fallen
asleep
he
heard
a
knocking
at
the
front
door
first
rather
timidly
performed
and
then
louder
nobody
answered
it
and
the
person
knocked
again
as
the
house
still
remained
undisturbed
stockdale
got
out
of
bed
went
to
his
window
which
overlooked
the
door
and
opening
it
asked
who
was
there
a
young
woman
voice
replied
that
susan
wallis
was
there
and
that
she
had
come
to
ask
if
newberry
could
give
her
some
mustard
to
make
a
plaster
with
as
her
father
was
taken
very
ill
on
the
chest
the
minister
having
neither
bell
nor
servant
was
compelled
to
act
in
person
will
call
newberry
he
said
partly
dressing
himself
he
went
along
the
passage
and
tapped
at
lizzy
door
she
did
not
answer
and
thinking
of
her
erratic
habits
in
the
matter
of
sleep
he
thumped
the
door
persistently
when
he
discovered
by
its
moving
ajar
under
his
knocking
that
it
had
only
been
gently
pushed
to
as
there
was
now
a
sufficient
entry
for
the
voice
he
knocked
no
longer
but
said
in
firm
tones
newberry
you
are
wanted
the
room
was
quite
silent
not
a
breathing
not
a
rustle
came
from
any
part
of
it
stockdale
now
sent
a
positive
shout
through
the
open
space
of
the
door
newberry
still
no
answer
or
movement
of
any
kind
within
then
he
heard
sounds
from
the
opposite
room
that
of
mother
as
if
she
had
been
aroused
by
his
uproar
though
lizzy
had
not
and
was
dressing
herself
hastily
stockdale
softly
closed
the
younger
woman
door
and
went
on
to
the
other
which
was
opened
by
simpkins
before
he
could
reach
it
she
was
in
her
ordinary
clothes
and
had
a
light
in
her
hand
the
person
calling
about
she
said
in
alarm
stockdale
told
the
girl
errand
adding
seriously
can
not
wake
mrs
newberry
is
no
matter
said
her
mother
can
let
the
girl
have
what
she
wants
as
well
as
my
daughter
and
she
came
out
of
the
room
and
went
downstairs
stockdale
retired
towards
his
own
apartment
saying
however
to
simpkins
from
the
landing
as
if
on
second
thoughts
suppose
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
newberry
that
i
could
not
wake
her
no
said
the
old
lady
hastily
at
all
still
the
minister
was
not
satisfied
you
go
in
and
see
he
said
should
be
much
more
at
ease
simpkins
returned
up
the
staircase
went
to
her
daughter
room
and
came
out
again
almost
instantly
is
nothing
at
all
the
matter
with
lizzy
she
said
and
descended
again
to
attend
to
the
applicant
who
having
seen
the
light
had
remained
quiet
during
this
interval
stockdale
went
into
his
room
and
lay
down
as
before
he
heard
mother
open
the
front
door
admit
the
girl
and
then
the
murmured
discourse
of
both
as
they
went
to
the
for
the
medicament
required
the
girl
departed
the
door
was
fastened
simpkins
came
upstairs
and
the
house
was
again
in
silence
still
the
minister
did
not
fall
asleep
he
could
not
get
rid
of
a
singular
suspicion
which
was
all
the
more
harassing
in
being
if
true
the
most
unaccountable
thing
within
his
experience
that
lizzy
newberry
was
in
her
bedroom
when
he
made
such
a
clamour
at
the
door
he
could
not
possibly
convince
himself
notwithstanding
that
he
had
heard
her
come
upstairs
at
the
usual
time
go
into
her
chamber
and
shut
herself
up
in
the
usual
way
yet
all
reason
was
so
much
against
her
being
elsewhere
that
he
was
constrained
to
go
back
again
to
the
unlikely
theory
of
a
heavy
sleep
though
he
had
heard
neither
breath
nor
movement
during
a
shouting
and
knocking
loud
enough
to
rouse
the
seven
sleepers
before
coming
to
any
positive
conclusion
he
fell
asleep
himself
and
did
not
awake
till
day
he
saw
nothing
of
newberry
in
the
morning
before
he
went
out
to
meet
the
rising
sun
as
he
liked
to
do
when
the
weather
was
fine
but
as
this
was
by
no
means
unusual
he
took
no
notice
of
it
at
he
knew
that
she
was
not
far
off
by
hearing
her
in
the
kitchen
and
though
he
saw
nothing
of
her
person
that
back
apartment
being
rigorously
closed
against
his
eyes
she
seemed
to
be
talking
ordering
and
bustling
about
among
the
pots
and
skimmers
in
so
ordinary
a
manner
that
there
was
no
reason
for
his
wasting
more
time
in
fruitless
surmise
the
minister
suffered
from
these
distractions
and
his
extemporized
sermons
were
not
improved
thereby
already
he
often
said
romans
for
corinthians
in
the
pulpit
and
gave
out
hymns
in
strange
cramped
metres
that
hitherto
had
always
been
skipped
because
the
congregation
could
not
raise
a
tune
to
fit
them
he
fully
resolved
that
as
soon
as
his
few
weeks
of
stay
approached
their
end
he
would
cut
the
matter
short
and
commit
himself
by
proposing
a
definite
engagement
repenting
at
leisure
if
necessary
with
this
end
in
view
he
suggested
to
her
on
the
evening
after
her
mysterious
sleep
that
they
should
take
a
walk
together
just
before
dark
the
latter
part
of
the
proposition
being
introduced
that
they
might
return
home
unseen
she
consented
to
go
and
away
they
went
over
a
stile
to
a
shrouded
footpath
suited
for
the
occasion
but
in
spite
of
attempts
on
both
sides
they
were
unable
to
infuse
much
spirit
into
the
ramble
she
looked
rather
paler
than
usual
and
sometimes
turned
her
head
away
said
stockdale
reproachfully
when
they
had
walked
in
silence
a
long
distance
said
she
yawned
much
my
company
is
to
you
he
put
it
in
that
way
but
he
was
really
wondering
whether
her
yawn
could
possibly
have
more
to
do
with
physical
weariness
from
the
night
before
than
mental
weariness
of
that
present
moment
lizzy
apologized
and
owned
that
she
was
rather
tired
which
gave
him
an
opening
for
a
direct
question
on
the
point
but
his
modesty
would
not
allow
him
to
put
it
to
her
and
he
uncomfortably
resolved
to
wait
the
month
of
february
passed
with
alternations
of
mud
and
frost
rain
and
sleet
east
winds
and
gales
the
hollow
places
in
the
ploughed
fields
showed
themselves
as
pools
of
water
which
had
settled
there
from
the
higher
levels
and
had
not
yet
found
time
to
soak
away
the
birds
began
to
get
lively
and
a
single
thrush
came
just
before
sunset
each
evening
and
sang
hopefully
on
the
large
which
stood
nearest
to
newberry
house
cold
blasts
and
brittle
earth
had
given
place
to
an
oozing
dampness
more
unpleasant
in
itself
than
frost
but
it
suggested
coming
spring
and
its
unpleasantness
was
of
a
bearable
kind
stockdale
had
been
going
to
bring
about
a
practical
understanding
with
lizzy
at
least
times
but
what
with
the
mystery
of
her
apparent
absence
on
the
night
of
the
neighbour
call
and
her
curious
way
of
lying
in
bed
at
unaccountable
times
he
felt
a
check
within
him
whenever
he
wanted
to
speak
out
thus
they
still
lived
on
as
indefinitely
affianced
lovers
each
of
whom
hardly
acknowledged
the
other
claim
to
the
name
of
chosen
one
stockdale
persuaded
himself
that
his
hesitation
was
owing
to
the
postponement
of
the
ordained
minister
arrival
and
the
consequent
delay
in
his
own
departure
which
did
away
with
all
necessity
for
haste
in
his
courtship
but
perhaps
it
was
only
that
his
discretion
was
reasserting
itself
and
telling
him
that
he
had
better
get
clearer
ideas
of
lizzy
before
arranging
for
the
grand
contract
of
his
life
with
her
she
on
her
part
always
seemed
ready
to
be
urged
further
on
that
question
than
he
had
hitherto
attempted
to
go
but
she
was
none
the
less
independent
and
to
a
degree
which
would
have
kept
from
flagging
the
passion
of
a
far
more
mutable
man
on
the
evening
of
the
first
of
march
he
went
casually
into
his
bedroom
about
dusk
and
noticed
lying
on
a
chair
a
greatcoat
hat
and
breeches
having
no
recollection
of
leaving
any
clothes
of
his
own
in
that
spot
he
went
and
examined
them
as
well
as
he
could
in
the
twilight
and
found
that
they
did
not
belong
to
him
he
paused
for
a
moment
to
consider
how
they
might
have
got
there
he
was
the
only
man
living
in
the
house
and
yet
these
were
not
his
garments
unless
he
had
made
a
mistake
no
they
were
not
his
he
called
up
martha
sarah
did
these
things
come
in
my
room
he
said
flinging
the
objectionable
articles
to
the
floor
martha
said
that
newberry
had
given
them
to
her
to
brush
and
that
she
had
brought
them
up
there
thinking
they
must
be
stockdale
as
there
was
no
other
gentleman
there
course
you
did
said
stockdale
take
them
down
to
your
and
say
they
are
some
clothes
i
have
found
here
and
know
nothing
about
as
the
door
was
left
open
he
heard
the
conversation
downstairs
stupid
said
newberry
in
a
tone
of
confusion
marther
sarer
i
did
not
tell
you
to
take
to
stockdale
room
thought
they
must
be
his
as
they
was
so
muddy
said
martha
humbly
should
have
left
on
the
said
the
young
mistress
severely
and
she
came
upstairs
with
the
garments
on
her
arm
quickly
passed
stockdale
room
and
threw
them
forcibly
into
a
closet
at
the
end
of
a
passage
with
this
the
incident
ended
and
the
house
was
silent
again
there
would
have
been
nothing
remarkable
in
finding
such
clothes
in
a
widow
house
had
they
been
clean
or
or
creased
or
mouldy
from
long
lying
by
but
that
they
should
be
splashed
with
recent
mud
bothered
stockdale
a
good
deal
when
a
young
pastor
is
in
the
aspen
stage
of
attachment
and
open
to
agitation
at
the
merest
trifles
a
really
substantial
incongruity
of
this
complexion
is
a
disturbing
thing
however
nothing
further
occurred
at
that
time
but
he
became
watchful
and
given
to
conjecture
and
was
unable
to
forget
the
circumstance
one
morning
on
looking
from
his
window
he
saw
newberry
herself
brushing
the
tails
of
a
long
drab
greatcoat
which
if
he
mistook
not
was
the
very
same
garment
as
the
one
that
had
adorned
the
chair
of
his
room
it
was
densely
splashed
up
to
the
hollow
of
the
back
with
neighbouring
mud
to
judge
by
its
colour
the
spots
being
distinctly
visible
to
him
in
the
sunlight
the
previous
day
or
two
having
been
wet
the
inference
was
irresistible
that
the
wearer
had
quite
recently
been
walking
some
considerable
distance
about
the
lanes
and
fields
stockdale
opened
the
window
and
looked
out
and
newberry
turned
her
head
her
face
became
slowly
red
she
never
had
looked
prettier
or
more
incomprehensible
he
waved
his
hand
affectionately
and
said
she
answered
with
embarrassment
having
ceased
her
occupation
on
the
instant
that
she
saw
him
and
rolled
up
the
coat
cleaned
stockdale
shut
the
window
some
simple
explanation
of
her
proceeding
was
doubtless
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
but
he
himself
could
not
think
of
one
and
he
wished
that
she
had
placed
the
matter
beyond
conjecture
by
voluntarily
saying
something
about
it
there
and
then
but
though
lizzy
had
not
offered
an
explanation
at
the
moment
the
subject
was
brought
forward
by
her
at
the
next
time
of
their
meeting
she
was
chatting
to
him
concerning
some
other
event
and
remarked
that
it
happened
about
the
time
when
she
was
dusting
some
old
clothes
that
had
belonged
to
her
poor
husband
keep
them
clean
out
of
respect
to
his
memory
said
stockdale
tentatively
air
and
dust
them
sometimes
she
said
with
the
most
charming
innocence
in
the
world
dead
men
come
out
of
their
graves
and
walk
in
mud
murmured
the
minister
in
a
cold
sweat
at
the
deception
that
she
was
practising
did
you
say
asked
lizzy
nothing
said
he
mournfully
words
a
phrase
that
will
do
for
my
sermon
next
sunday
it
was
too
plain
that
lizzy
was
unaware
that
he
had
seen
actual
pedestrian
splashes
upon
the
skirts
of
the
tale
overcoat
and
that
she
imagined
him
to
believe
it
had
come
direct
from
some
chest
or
drawer
the
aspect
of
the
case
was
now
considerably
darker
stockdale
was
so
much
depressed
by
it
that
he
did
not
challenge
her
explanation
or
threaten
to
go
off
as
a
missionary
to
benighted
islanders
or
reproach
her
in
any
way
whatever
he
simply
parted
from
her
when
she
had
done
talking
and
lived
on
in
perplexity
till
by
degrees
his
natural
manner
became
sad
and
constrained
chapter
iv
at
the
time
of
the
new
moon
the
following
thursday
was
changeable
damp
and
gloomy
and
the
night
threatened
to
be
windy
and
unpleasant
stockdale
had
gone
away
to
knollsea
in
the
morning
to
be
present
at
some
commemoration
service
there
and
on
his
return
he
was
met
by
the
attractive
lizzy
in
the
passage
whether
influenced
by
the
tide
of
cheerfulness
which
had
attended
him
that
day
or
by
the
drive
through
the
open
air
or
whether
from
a
natural
disposition
to
let
bygones
alone
he
allowed
himself
to
be
fascinated
into
forgetfulness
of
the
greatcoat
incident
and
upon
the
whole
passed
a
pleasant
evening
not
so
much
in
her
society
as
within
sound
of
her
voice
as
she
sat
talking
in
the
back
parlour
to
her
mother
till
the
latter
went
to
bed
shortly
after
this
newberry
retired
and
then
stockdale
prepared
to
go
upstairs
himself
but
before
he
left
the
room
he
remained
standing
by
the
dying
embers
awhile
thinking
long
of
one
thing
and
another
and
was
only
aroused
by
the
flickering
of
his
candle
in
the
socket
as
it
suddenly
declined
and
went
out
knowing
that
there
were
a
matches
and
another
candle
in
his
bedroom
he
felt
his
way
upstairs
without
a
light
on
reaching
his
chamber
he
laid
his
hand
on
every
possible
ledge
and
corner
for
the
tinderbox
but
for
a
long
time
in
vain
discovering
it
at
length
stockdale
produced
a
spark
and
was
kindling
the
brimstone
when
he
fancied
that
he
heard
a
movement
in
the
passage
he
blew
harder
at
the
lint
the
match
flared
up
and
looking
by
aid
of
the
blue
light
through
the
door
which
had
been
standing
open
all
this
time
he
was
surprised
to
see
a
male
figure
vanishing
round
the
top
of
the
staircase
with
the
evident
intention
of
escaping
unobserved
the
personage
wore
the
clothes
which
lizzy
had
been
brushing
and
something
in
the
outline
and
gait
suggested
to
the
minister
that
the
wearer
was
lizzy
herself
but
he
was
not
sure
of
this
and
greatly
excited
stockdale
determined
to
investigate
the
mystery
and
to
adopt
his
own
way
for
doing
it
he
blew
out
the
match
without
lighting
the
candle
went
into
the
passage
and
proceeded
on
tiptoe
towards
lizzy
room
a
faint
grey
square
of
light
in
the
direction
of
the
as
he
approached
told
him
that
the
door
was
open
and
at
once
suggested
that
the
occupant
was
gone
he
turned
and
brought
down
his
fist
upon
the
handrail
of
the
staircase
was
she
in
her
late
husband
coat
and
hat
somewhat
relieved
to
find
that
there
was
no
intruder
in
the
case
yet
none
the
less
surprised
the
minister
crept
down
the
stairs
softly
put
on
his
boots
overcoat
and
hat
and
tried
the
front
door
it
was
fastened
as
usual
he
went
to
the
back
door
found
this
unlocked
and
emerged
into
the
garden
the
night
was
mild
and
moonless
and
rain
had
lately
been
falling
though
for
the
present
it
had
ceased
there
was
a
sudden
dropping
from
the
trees
and
bushes
every
now
and
then
as
each
passing
wind
shook
their
boughs
among
these
sounds
stockdale
heard
the
faint
fall
of
feet
upon
the
road
outside
and
he
guessed
from
the
step
that
it
was
lizzy
he
followed
the
sound
and
helped
by
the
circumstance
of
the
wind
blowing
from
the
direction
in
which
the
pedestrian
moved
he
got
nearly
close
to
her
and
kept
there
without
risk
of
being
overheard
while
he
thus
followed
her
up
the
street
or
lane
as
it
might
indifferently
be
called
there
being
more
hedge
than
houses
on
either
side
a
figure
came
forward
to
her
from
one
of
the
cottage
doors
lizzy
stopped
the
minister
stepped
upon
the
grass
and
stopped
also
that
mrs
newberry
said
the
man
who
had
come
out
whose
voice
stockdale
recognized
as
that
of
one
of
the
most
devout
members
of
his
congregation
is
said
lizzy
be
quite
ready
i
been
here
this
john
said
she
have
bad
news
there
is
danger
for
our
venture
d
tell
i
dreamed
there
might
be
she
said
hurriedly
you
must
go
at
once
round
to
where
the
chaps
are
waiting
and
tell
them
they
will
not
be
wanted
till
night
at
the
same
time
i
go
to
burn
the
lugger
off
will
he
said
and
instantly
went
off
through
a
gate
lizzy
continuing
her
way
on
she
tripped
at
a
quickening
pace
till
the
lane
turned
into
the
which
she
crossed
and
got
into
the
track
for
ringsworth
here
she
ascended
the
hill
without
the
least
hesitation
passed
the
lonely
hamlet
of
holworth
and
went
down
the
vale
on
the
other
side
stockdale
had
never
taken
any
extensive
walks
in
this
direction
but
he
was
aware
that
if
she
persisted
in
her
course
much
longer
she
would
draw
near
to
the
coast
which
was
here
between
two
and
three
miles
distant
from
and
as
it
had
been
about
a
eleven
when
they
set
out
her
intention
seemed
to
be
to
reach
the
shore
about
midnight
lizzy
soon
ascended
a
small
mound
which
stockdale
at
the
same
time
adroitly
skirted
on
the
left
and
a
dull
monotonous
roar
burst
upon
his
ear
the
hillock
was
about
fifty
yards
from
the
top
of
the
cliffs
and
by
day
it
apparently
commanded
a
full
view
of
the
bay
there
was
light
enough
in
the
sky
to
show
her
disguised
figure
against
it
when
she
reached
the
top
where
she
paused
and
afterwards
sat
down
stockdale
not
wishing
on
any
account
to
alarm
her
at
this
moment
yet
desirous
of
being
near
her
sank
upon
his
hands
and
knees
crept
a
little
higher
up
and
there
stayed
still
the
wind
was
chilly
the
ground
damp
and
his
position
one
in
which
he
did
not
care
to
remain
long
however
before
he
had
decided
to
leave
it
the
young
man
heard
voices
behind
him
what
they
signified
he
did
not
know
but
fearing
that
lizzy
was
in
danger
he
was
about
to
run
forward
and
warn
her
that
she
might
be
seen
when
she
crept
to
the
shelter
of
a
little
bush
which
maintained
a
precarious
existence
in
that
exposed
spot
and
her
form
was
absorbed
in
its
dark
and
stunted
outline
as
if
she
had
become
part
of
it
she
had
evidently
heard
the
men
as
well
as
he
they
passed
near
him
talking
in
loud
and
careless
tones
which
could
be
heard
above
the
uninterrupted
washings
of
the
sea
and
which
suggested
that
they
were
not
engaged
in
any
business
at
their
own
risk
this
proved
to
be
the
fact
some
of
their
words
floated
across
to
him
and
caused
him
to
forget
at
once
the
coldness
of
his
situation
the
vessel
lugger
about
fifty
tons
cherbourg
i
suppose
it
do
all
belong
to
owlett
no
he
only
got
a
share
there
another
or
two
in
it
a
farmer
and
such
like
but
the
names
i
do
know
the
voices
died
away
and
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
the
men
diminished
towards
the
cliff
and
dropped
out
of
sight
darling
has
been
tempted
to
buy
a
share
by
that
unbeliever
owlett
groaned
the
minister
his
honest
affection
for
lizzy
having
quickened
to
its
intensest
point
during
these
moments
of
risk
to
her
person
and
name
why
she
here
he
said
to
himself
it
will
be
the
ruin
of
her
his
perturbation
was
interrupted
by
the
sudden
bursting
out
of
a
bright
and
increasing
light
from
the
spot
where
lizzy
was
in
hiding
a
few
seconds
later
and
before
it
had
reached
the
height
of
a
blaze
he
heard
her
rush
past
him
down
the
hollow
like
a
stone
from
a
sling
in
the
direction
of
home
the
light
now
flared
high
and
wide
and
showed
its
position
clearly
she
had
kindled
a
bough
of
furze
and
stuck
it
into
the
bush
under
which
she
had
been
crouching
the
wind
fanned
the
flame
which
crackled
fiercely
and
threatened
to
consume
the
bush
as
well
as
the
bough
stockdale
paused
just
long
enough
to
notice
thus
much
and
then
followed
rapidly
the
route
taken
by
the
young
woman
his
intention
was
to
overtake
her
and
reveal
himself
as
a
friend
but
run
as
he
would
he
could
see
nothing
of
her
thus
he
flew
across
the
open
country
about
holworth
twisting
his
legs
and
ankles
in
unexpected
fissures
and
descents
till
on
coming
to
the
gate
between
the
downs
and
the
road
he
was
forced
to
pause
to
get
breath
there
was
no
audible
movement
either
in
front
or
behind
him
and
he
now
concluded
that
she
had
not
outrun
him
but
that
hearing
him
at
her
heels
and
believing
him
one
of
the
excise
party
she
had
hidden
herself
somewhere
on
the
way
and
let
him
pass
by
he
went
on
at
a
more
leisurely
pace
towards
the
village
on
reaching
the
house
he
found
his
surmise
to
be
correct
for
the
gate
was
on
the
latch
and
the
door
unfastened
just
as
he
had
left
them
stockdale
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
waited
silently
in
the
passage
in
about
ten
minutes
he
heard
the
same
light
footstep
that
he
had
heard
in
going
out
it
paused
at
the
gate
which
opened
and
shut
softly
and
then
the
latch
was
lifted
and
lizzy
came
in
stockdale
went
forward
and
said
at
once
do
be
frightened
i
have
been
waiting
up
for
you
she
started
though
she
had
recognized
the
voice
is
stockdale
is
it
she
said
he
answered
becoming
angry
now
that
she
was
safe
indoors
and
not
alarmed
a
nice
game
i
found
you
out
in
you
are
in
man
clothes
and
i
am
ashamed
of
you
lizzy
could
hardly
find
a
voice
to
answer
this
unexpected
reproach
am
only
partly
in
man
clothes
she
faltered
shrinking
back
to
the
wall
is
only
his
greatcoat
and
hat
and
breeches
that
i
got
on
which
is
no
harm
as
he
was
my
own
husband
and
i
do
it
only
because
a
cloak
blows
about
so
and
you
ca
use
your
arms
i
have
got
my
own
dress
under
just
the
same
it
is
only
tucked
in
will
you
go
away
upstairs
and
let
me
pass
i
did
want
you
to
see
me
at
such
a
time
as
this
i
have
a
right
to
see
you
how
do
you
think
there
can
be
anything
between
us
now
lizzy
was
silent
are
a
smuggler
he
continued
sadly
have
only
a
share
in
the
run
she
said
makes
no
difference
whatever
did
you
engage
in
such
a
trade
as
that
for
and
keep
it
such
a
secret
from
me
all
this
time
do
do
it
always
i
only
do
it
in
when
is
new
moon
i
suppose
that
because
it
ca
be
done
anywhen
else
you
have
regularly
upset
me
lizzy
am
sorry
for
that
lizzy
meekly
replied
now
said
he
more
tenderly
harm
is
done
as
yet
wo
you
for
the
sake
of
me
give
up
this
blamable
and
dangerous
practice
altogether
must
do
my
best
to
save
this
run
said
she
getting
rather
husky
in
the
throat
do
want
to
give
you
up
you
know
that
but
i
want
to
lose
my
venture
i
do
know
what
to
do
now
why
i
have
kept
it
so
secret
from
you
is
that
i
was
afraid
you
would
be
angry
if
you
knew
should
think
so
i
suppose
if
i
had
married
you
without
finding
this
out
you
have
gone
on
with
it
just
the
same
do
know
i
did
not
think
so
far
ahead
i
only
went
to
burn
the
folks
off
because
we
found
that
the
excisemen
knew
where
the
tubs
were
to
be
landed
is
a
pretty
mess
to
be
in
altogether
is
this
said
the
distracted
young
minister
what
will
you
do
now
lizzy
slowly
murmured
the
particulars
of
their
plan
the
chief
of
which
were
that
they
meant
to
try
their
luck
at
some
other
point
of
the
shore
the
next
night
that
three
were
always
agreed
upon
before
the
run
was
attempted
with
the
understanding
that
if
the
vessel
was
off
from
the
first
point
which
was
ringsworth
as
it
had
been
by
her
the
crew
should
attempt
to
make
the
second
which
was
lulstead
cove
on
the
second
night
and
if
there
too
danger
threatened
they
should
on
the
third
night
try
the
third
place
which
was
behind
a
headland
further
west
the
officers
hinder
them
landing
there
too
he
said
his
attention
to
this
interesting
programme
displacing
for
a
moment
his
concern
at
her
share
in
it
we
sha
try
anywhere
else
all
this
dark
that
what
we
call
the
time
between
moon
and
moon
and
perhaps
they
string
the
tubs
to
a
and
sink
a
from
shore
and
take
the
bearings
and
then
when
they
have
a
chance
they
go
to
creep
for
that
they
go
out
in
a
boat
and
drag
a
creeper
that
a
grapnel
along
the
bottom
till
it
catch
hold
of
the
the
minister
stood
thinking
and
there
was
no
sound
within
doors
but
the
tick
of
the
clock
on
the
stairs
and
the
quick
breathing
of
lizzy
partly
from
her
walk
and
partly
from
agitation
as
she
stood
close
to
the
wall
not
in
such
complete
darkness
but
that
he
could
discern
against
its
whitewashed
surface
the
greatcoat
and
broad
hat
which
covered
her
all
this
is
very
wrong
he
said
you
remember
the
lesson
of
the
render
unto
caesar
the
things
that
are
caesar
surely
you
have
heard
that
read
times
enough
in
your
growing
up
dead
she
pouted
the
spirit
of
the
text
is
in
force
just
the
same
father
did
it
and
so
did
my
grandfather
and
almost
everybody
in
lives
by
it
and
life
would
be
so
dull
if
it
was
for
that
that
i
should
not
care
to
live
at
all
am
nothing
to
live
for
of
course
he
replied
bitterly
would
not
think
it
worth
while
to
give
up
this
wild
business
and
live
for
me
alone
have
never
looked
at
it
like
that
you
wo
promise
and
wait
till
i
am
ready
can
not
give
you
my
word
and
looking
thoughtfully
down
she
gradually
moved
and
moved
away
going
into
the
adjoining
room
and
closing
the
door
between
them
she
remained
there
in
the
dark
till
he
was
tired
of
waiting
and
had
gone
up
to
his
own
chamber
poor
stockdale
was
dreadfully
depressed
all
the
next
day
by
the
discoveries
of
the
night
before
lizzy
was
unmistakably
a
fascinating
young
woman
but
as
a
minister
wife
she
was
hardly
to
be
contemplated
i
had
only
stuck
to
father
little
grocery
business
instead
of
going
in
for
the
ministry
she
would
have
suited
me
beautifully
he
said
sadly
until
he
remembered
that
in
that
case
he
would
never
have
come
from
his
distant
home
to
and
never
have
known
her
the
estrangement
between
them
was
not
complete
but
it
was
sufficient
to
keep
them
out
of
each
other
company
once
during
the
day
he
met
her
in
the
and
said
turning
a
reproachful
eye
upon
her
you
promise
lizzy
but
she
did
not
reply
the
evening
drew
on
and
he
knew
well
enough
that
lizzy
would
repeat
her
excursion
at
night
her
offended
manner
had
shown
that
she
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
altering
her
plans
at
present
he
did
not
wish
to
repeat
his
own
share
of
the
adventure
but
act
as
he
would
his
uneasiness
on
her
account
increased
with
the
decline
of
day
supposing
that
an
accident
should
befall
her
he
would
never
forgive
himself
for
not
being
there
to
help
much
as
he
disliked
the
idea
of
seeming
to
countenance
such
unlawful
escapades
chapter
v
how
they
went
to
lulstead
cove
as
he
had
expected
she
left
the
house
at
the
same
hour
at
night
this
time
passing
his
door
without
stealth
as
if
she
knew
very
well
that
he
would
be
watching
and
were
resolved
to
brave
his
displeasure
he
was
quite
ready
opened
the
door
quickly
and
reached
the
back
door
almost
as
soon
as
she
you
will
go
lizzy
he
said
as
he
stood
on
the
step
beside
her
who
now
again
appeared
as
a
little
man
with
a
face
altogether
unsuited
to
his
clothes
must
she
said
repressed
by
his
stern
manner
i
shall
go
too
said
he
i
am
sure
you
will
enjoy
it
she
exclaimed
in
more
buoyant
tones
does
who
tries
it
forbid
that
i
should
he
said
i
must
look
after
you
they
opened
the
wicket
and
went
up
the
road
abreast
of
each
other
but
at
some
distance
apart
scarcely
a
word
passing
between
them
the
evening
was
rather
less
favourable
to
smuggling
enterprise
than
the
last
had
been
the
wind
being
lower
and
the
sky
somewhat
clear
towards
the
north
is
rather
lighter
said
stockdale
unfortunately
said
she
it
is
only
from
those
few
stars
over
there
the
moon
was
new
at
four
and
i
expected
clouds
i
hope
we
shall
be
able
to
do
it
this
dark
for
when
we
have
to
sink
for
long
it
makes
the
stuff
taste
bleachy
and
folks
do
like
it
so
well
her
course
was
different
from
that
of
the
preceding
night
branching
off
to
the
left
over
lord
barrow
as
soon
as
they
had
got
out
of
the
lane
and
crossed
the
highway
by
the
time
they
reached
chaldon
down
stockdale
who
had
been
in
perplexed
thought
as
to
what
he
should
say
to
her
decided
that
he
would
not
attempt
expostulation
now
while
she
was
excited
by
the
adventure
but
wait
till
it
was
over
and
endeavour
to
keep
her
from
such
practices
in
future
it
occurred
to
him
once
or
twice
as
they
rambled
on
that
should
they
be
surprised
by
the
excisemen
his
situation
would
be
more
awkward
than
hers
for
it
would
be
difficult
to
prove
his
true
motive
in
coming
to
the
spot
but
the
risk
was
a
slight
consideration
beside
his
wish
to
be
with
her
they
now
arrived
at
a
ravine
which
lay
on
the
outskirts
of
chaldon
a
village
two
miles
on
their
way
towards
the
point
of
the
shore
they
sought
lizzy
broke
the
silence
this
time
have
to
wait
here
to
meet
the
carriers
i
do
know
if
they
have
come
yet
as
i
told
you
we
go
to
lulstead
cove
and
it
is
two
miles
further
than
ringsworth
it
turned
out
that
the
men
had
already
come
for
while
she
spoke
two
or
three
dozen
heads
broke
the
line
of
the
slope
and
a
company
of
them
at
once
descended
from
the
bushes
where
they
had
been
lying
in
wait
these
carriers
were
men
whom
lizzy
and
other
proprietors
regularly
employed
to
bring
the
tubs
from
the
boat
to
a
inland
they
were
all
young
fellows
of
chaldon
and
the
neighbourhood
quiet
and
inoffensive
persons
who
simply
engaged
to
carry
the
cargo
for
lizzy
and
her
cousin
owlett
as
they
would
have
engaged
in
any
other
labour
for
which
they
were
fairly
well
paid
at
a
word
from
her
they
closed
in
together
had
better
take
it
now
she
said
to
them
and
handed
to
each
a
packet
it
contained
six
shillings
their
remuneration
for
the
night
undertaking
which
was
paid
beforehand
without
reference
to
success
or
failure
but
besides
this
they
had
the
privilege
of
selling
as
agents
when
the
run
was
successfully
made
as
soon
as
it
was
done
she
said
to
them
place
is
the
old
one
near
lulstead
cove
the
men
till
that
moment
not
having
been
told
whither
they
were
bound
for
obvious
reasons
will
meet
you
there
added
lizzy
shall
follow
behind
to
see
that
we
are
not
watched
the
carriers
went
on
and
stockdale
and
newberry
followed
at
a
distance
of
a
stone
throw
do
these
men
do
by
day
he
said
or
fourteen
of
them
are
labouring
men
some
are
brickmakers
some
carpenters
some
some
thatchers
they
are
all
known
to
me
very
well
nine
of
are
of
your
own
congregation
ca
help
that
said
stockdale
i
know
you
ca
i
only
told
you
the
others
are
more
because
they
supply
the
with
all
the
spirits
he
requires
and
they
do
wish
to
show
unfriendliness
to
a
customer
do
you
choose
said
stockdale
choose
for
their
closeness
and
because
they
are
strong
and
surefooted
and
able
to
carry
a
heavy
load
a
long
way
without
being
tired
stockdale
sighed
as
she
enumerated
each
particular
for
it
proved
how
far
involved
in
the
business
a
woman
must
be
who
was
so
well
acquainted
with
its
conditions
and
needs
and
yet
he
felt
more
tenderly
towards
her
at
this
moment
than
he
had
felt
all
the
foregoing
day
perhaps
it
was
that
her
experienced
manner
and
hold
indifference
stirred
his
admiration
in
spite
of
himself
my
arm
lizzy
he
murmured
do
want
it
she
said
we
may
never
be
to
each
other
again
what
we
once
have
been
depends
upon
you
said
he
and
they
went
on
again
as
before
the
hired
carriers
paced
along
over
chaldon
down
with
as
little
hesitation
as
if
it
had
been
day
avoiding
the
and
leaving
the
village
of
east
chaldon
on
the
left
so
as
to
reach
the
crest
of
the
hill
at
a
lonely
trackless
place
not
far
from
the
ancient
earthwork
called
round
pound
an
hour
brisk
walking
brought
them
within
sound
of
the
sea
not
many
hundred
yards
from
lulstead
cove
here
they
paused
and
lizzy
and
stockdale
came
up
with
them
when
they
went
on
together
to
the
verge
of
the
cliff
one
of
the
men
now
produced
an
iron
bar
which
he
drove
firmly
into
the
soil
a
yard
from
the
edge
and
attached
to
it
a
rope
that
he
had
uncoiled
from
his
body
they
all
began
to
descend
partly
stepping
partly
sliding
down
the
incline
as
the
rope
slipped
through
their
hands
will
not
go
to
the
bottom
lizzy
said
stockdale
anxiously
i
stay
here
to
watch
she
said
is
down
there
the
men
remained
quite
silent
when
they
reached
the
shore
and
the
next
thing
audible
to
the
two
at
the
top
was
the
dip
of
heavy
oars
and
the
dashing
of
waves
against
a
boat
bow
in
a
moment
the
keel
gently
touched
the
shingle
and
stockdale
heard
the
footsteps
of
the
carriers
running
forwards
over
the
pebbles
towards
the
point
of
landing
there
was
a
sousing
in
the
water
as
of
a
brood
of
ducks
plunging
in
showing
that
the
men
had
not
been
particular
about
keeping
their
legs
or
even
their
waists
dry
from
the
brine
but
it
was
impossible
to
see
what
they
were
doing
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
shingle
was
trampled
again
the
iron
bar
sustaining
the
rope
on
which
stockdale
hand
rested
began
to
swerve
a
little
and
the
carriers
one
by
one
appeared
climbing
up
the
sloping
cliff
dripping
audibly
as
they
came
and
sustaining
themselves
by
the
each
man
on
reaching
the
top
was
seen
to
be
carrying
a
pair
of
tubs
one
on
his
back
and
one
on
his
chest
the
two
being
slung
together
by
cords
passing
round
the
chine
hoops
and
resting
on
the
carrier
shoulders
some
of
the
stronger
men
carried
three
by
putting
an
extra
one
on
the
top
behind
but
the
customary
load
was
a
pair
these
being
quite
weighty
enough
to
give
their
bearer
the
sensation
of
having
chest
and
backbone
in
contact
after
a
walk
of
four
or
five
miles
is
owlett
said
lizzy
to
one
of
them
will
not
come
up
this
way
said
the
carrier
to
bide
on
shore
till
we
be
safe
off
then
without
waiting
for
the
rest
the
foremost
men
plunged
across
the
down
and
when
the
last
had
ascended
lizzy
pulled
up
the
rope
wound
it
round
her
arm
wriggled
the
bar
from
the
sod
and
turned
to
follow
the
carriers
are
very
anxious
about
owlett
safety
said
the
minister
there
ever
such
a
man
said
lizzy
is
he
my
cousin
well
it
is
a
bad
night
work
said
stockdale
heavily
i
carry
the
bar
and
rope
for
you
god
the
tubs
have
got
so
far
all
right
said
she
stockdale
shook
his
head
and
taking
the
bar
walked
by
her
side
towards
the
downs
and
the
moan
of
the
sea
was
heard
no
more
this
what
you
meant
the
other
day
when
you
spoke
of
having
business
with
owlett
the
young
man
asked
is
it
she
replied
never
see
him
on
any
other
matter
partnership
of
that
kind
with
a
young
man
is
very
odd
was
begun
by
my
father
and
his
who
were
her
companion
could
not
blind
himself
to
the
fact
that
where
tastes
and
pursuits
were
so
akin
as
lizzy
and
owlett
and
where
risks
were
shared
as
with
them
in
every
undertaking
there
would
be
a
peculiar
appropriateness
in
her
answering
owlett
standing
question
on
matrimony
in
the
affirmative
this
did
not
soothe
stockdale
its
tendency
being
rather
to
stimulate
in
him
an
effort
to
make
the
pair
as
inappropriate
as
possible
and
win
her
away
from
this
nocturnal
crew
to
correctness
of
conduct
and
a
minister
parlour
in
some
inland
county
they
had
been
walking
near
enough
to
the
file
of
carriers
for
stockdale
to
perceive
that
when
they
got
into
the
road
to
the
village
they
split
up
into
two
companies
of
unequal
size
each
of
which
made
off
in
a
direction
of
its
own
one
company
the
smaller
of
the
two
went
towards
the
church
and
by
the
time
that
lizzy
and
stockdale
reached
their
own
house
these
men
had
scaled
the
churchyard
wall
and
were
proceeding
noiselessly
over
the
grass
within
see
that
owlett
has
arranged
for
one
batch
to
be
put
in
the
church
again
observed
lizzy
you
remember
my
taking
you
there
the
first
night
you
came
of
course
said
stockdale
wonder
you
had
permission
to
broach
the
tubs
they
were
his
i
suppose
they
were
not
they
were
mine
i
had
permission
from
myself
the
day
after
that
they
went
several
miles
inland
in
a
of
manure
and
sold
very
well
at
this
moment
the
group
of
men
who
had
made
off
to
the
left
some
time
before
began
leaping
one
by
one
from
the
hedge
opposite
lizzy
house
and
the
first
man
who
had
no
tubs
upon
his
shoulders
came
forward
newberry
is
it
he
said
hastily
jim
said
she
the
matter
find
that
we
ca
put
any
in
badger
clump
lizzy
said
owlett
place
is
watched
we
must
sling
the
in
the
orchet
if
there
time
we
ca
put
any
more
under
the
church
lumber
than
i
have
sent
on
there
and
my
mixen
hev
already
more
in
en
than
is
safe
well
she
said
quick
about
it
that
all
what
can
i
do
at
all
please
ah
it
is
the
minister
you
two
that
ca
do
anything
had
better
get
indoors
and
not
be
zeed
while
owlett
thus
conversed
in
a
tone
so
full
of
contraband
anxiety
and
so
free
from
lover
jealousy
the
men
who
followed
him
had
been
descending
one
by
one
from
the
hedge
and
it
unfortunately
happened
that
when
the
hindmost
took
his
leap
the
cord
slipped
which
sustained
his
tubs
the
result
was
that
both
the
kegs
fell
into
the
road
one
of
them
being
stove
in
by
the
blow
drown
it
all
said
owlett
rushing
back
is
worth
a
good
deal
i
suppose
said
stockdale
no
about
two
guineas
and
half
to
us
now
said
lizzy
excitedly
is
that
it
is
the
smell
it
is
so
blazing
strong
before
it
has
been
lowered
by
water
that
it
smells
dreadfully
when
spilt
in
the
road
like
that
i
do
hope
latimer
wo
pass
by
till
it
is
gone
off
owlett
and
one
or
two
others
picked
up
the
burst
tub
and
began
to
scrape
and
trample
over
the
spot
to
disperse
the
liquor
as
much
as
possible
and
then
they
all
entered
the
gate
of
owlett
orchard
which
adjoined
lizzy
garden
on
the
right
stockdale
did
not
care
to
follow
them
for
several
on
recognizing
him
had
looked
wonderingly
at
his
presence
though
they
said
nothing
lizzy
left
his
side
and
went
to
the
bottom
of
the
garden
looking
over
the
hedge
into
the
orchard
where
the
men
could
be
dimly
seen
bustling
about
and
apparently
hiding
the
tubs
all
was
done
noiselessly
and
without
a
light
and
when
it
was
over
they
dispersed
in
different
directions
those
who
had
taken
their
cargoes
to
the
church
having
already
gone
off
to
their
homes
lizzy
returned
to
the
over
which
stockdale
was
still
abstractedly
leaning
is
all
finished
i
am
going
indoors
now
she
said
gently
will
leave
the
door
ajar
for
you
no
you
need
said
stockdale
am
coming
too
but
before
either
of
them
had
moved
the
faint
clatter
of
horses
hoofs
broke
upon
the
ear
and
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
point
where
the
track
across
the
down
joined
the
hard
road
are
just
too
late
cried
lizzy
exultingly
said
stockdale
the
and
some
assistant
of
his
we
had
better
go
indoors
they
entered
the
house
and
lizzy
bolted
the
door
do
get
a
light
stockdale
she
said
course
i
will
not
said
he
thought
you
might
be
on
the
side
of
the
king
said
lizzy
with
faintest
sarcasm
am
said
stockdale
lizzy
newberry
i
love
you
and
you
know
it
perfectly
well
and
you
ought
to
know
if
you
do
not
what
i
have
suffered
in
my
conscience
on
your
account
these
last
few
days
guess
very
well
she
said
hurriedly
i
do
see
why
ah
you
are
better
than
i
the
trotting
of
the
horses
seemed
to
have
again
died
away
and
the
pair
of
listeners
touched
each
other
fingers
in
the
cold
of
those
whom
something
seriously
divided
they
were
on
the
landing
but
before
they
had
taken
three
steps
apart
the
tramp
of
the
horsemen
suddenly
revived
almost
close
to
the
house
lizzy
turned
to
the
staircase
window
opened
the
casement
about
an
inch
and
put
her
face
close
to
the
aperture
one
of
is
latimer
she
whispered
always
rides
a
white
horse
one
would
think
it
was
the
last
colour
for
a
man
in
that
line
stockdale
looked
and
saw
the
white
shape
of
the
animal
as
it
passed
by
but
before
the
riders
had
gone
another
ten
yards
latimer
reined
in
his
horse
and
said
something
to
his
companion
which
neither
stockdale
nor
lizzy
could
hear
its
drift
was
however
soon
made
evident
for
the
other
man
stopped
also
and
sharply
turning
the
horses
heads
they
cautiously
retraced
their
steps
when
they
were
again
opposite
newberry
garden
latimer
dismounted
and
the
man
on
the
dark
horse
did
the
same
lizzy
and
stockdale
intently
listening
and
observing
the
proceedings
naturally
put
their
heads
as
close
as
possible
to
the
slit
formed
by
the
slightly
opened
casement
and
thus
it
occurred
that
at
last
their
cheeks
came
positively
into
contact
they
went
on
listening
as
if
they
did
not
know
of
the
singular
incident
which
had
happened
to
their
faces
and
the
pressure
of
each
to
each
rather
increased
than
lessened
with
the
lapse
of
time
they
could
hear
the
excisemen
sniffing
the
air
like
hounds
as
they
paced
slowly
along
when
they
reached
the
spot
where
the
tub
had
burst
both
stopped
on
the
instant
ay
is
quite
strong
here
said
the
second
officer
we
knock
at
the
door
no
said
latimer
this
is
only
a
trick
to
put
us
off
the
scent
they
would
kick
up
this
stink
anywhere
near
their
i
have
known
such
things
before
the
things
or
some
of
must
have
been
brought
this
way
said
the
other
said
latimer
musingly
is
all
done
to
tole
us
the
wrong
way
i
have
a
mind
that
we
go
home
for
without
saying
a
word
and
come
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
with
more
hands
i
know
they
have
storages
about
here
but
we
can
do
nothing
by
this
owl
light
we
will
look
round
the
parish
and
see
if
everybody
is
in
bed
john
and
if
all
is
quiet
we
will
do
as
i
say
they
went
on
and
the
two
inside
the
window
could
hear
them
passing
leisurely
through
the
whole
village
the
street
of
which
curved
round
at
the
bottom
and
entered
the
turnpike
road
at
another
junction
this
way
the
excisemen
followed
and
the
amble
of
their
horses
died
quite
away
will
you
do
said
stockdale
withdrawing
from
his
position
she
knew
that
he
alluded
to
the
coming
search
by
the
officers
to
divert
her
attention
from
their
own
tender
incident
by
the
casement
which
he
wished
to
be
passed
over
as
a
thing
rather
dreamt
of
than
done
nothing
she
replied
with
as
much
coolness
as
she
could
command
under
her
disappointment
at
his
manner
often
have
such
storms
as
this
you
would
not
be
frightened
if
you
knew
what
fools
they
are
fancy
riding
o
horseback
through
the
place
of
course
they
will
hear
and
see
nobody
while
they
make
that
noise
but
they
are
always
afraid
to
get
off
in
case
some
of
our
fellows
should
burst
out
upon
and
tie
them
up
to
the
as
they
have
done
before
now
mr
stockdale
she
closed
the
window
and
went
to
her
room
where
a
tear
fell
from
her
eyes
and
that
not
because
of
the
alertness
of
the
chapter
vi
the
great
search
at
stockdale
was
so
excited
by
the
events
of
the
evening
and
the
dilemma
that
he
was
placed
in
between
conscience
and
love
that
he
did
not
sleep
or
even
doze
but
remained
as
broadly
awake
as
at
noonday
as
soon
as
the
grey
light
began
to
touch
ever
so
faintly
the
whiter
objects
in
his
bedroom
he
arose
dressed
himself
and
went
downstairs
into
the
road
the
village
was
already
astir
several
of
the
carriers
had
heard
the
tramp
of
latimer
horse
while
they
were
undressing
in
the
dark
that
night
and
had
already
communicated
with
each
other
and
owlett
on
the
subject
the
only
doubt
seemed
to
be
about
the
safety
of
those
tubs
which
had
been
left
under
the
church
and
after
a
short
discussion
at
the
corner
of
the
mill
it
was
agreed
that
these
should
be
removed
before
it
got
lighter
and
hidden
in
the
middle
of
a
double
hedge
bordering
the
adjoining
field
however
before
anything
could
be
carried
into
effect
the
footsteps
of
many
men
were
heard
coming
down
the
lane
from
the
highway
it
here
they
be
said
owlett
who
having
already
drawn
the
hatch
and
started
his
mill
for
the
day
stood
stolidly
at
the
covered
with
flour
as
if
the
interest
of
his
whole
soul
was
bound
up
in
the
shaking
walls
around
him
the
two
or
three
with
whom
he
had
been
talking
dispersed
to
their
usual
work
and
when
the
excise
officers
and
the
formidable
body
of
men
they
had
hired
reached
the
village
cross
between
the
mill
and
newberry
house
the
village
wore
the
natural
aspect
of
a
place
beginning
its
morning
labours
said
latimer
to
his
associates
who
numbered
thirteen
men
in
all
i
know
is
that
the
things
are
somewhere
in
this
here
place
we
have
got
the
day
before
us
and
is
hard
if
we
ca
light
upon
and
get
to
budmouth
before
night
first
we
will
try
the
and
then
we
work
our
way
into
the
chimmers
and
then
to
the
ricks
and
stables
and
so
creep
round
you
have
nothing
but
your
noses
to
guide
ye
mind
so
use
if
you
never
did
in
your
lives
before
then
the
search
began
owlett
during
the
early
part
watched
from
his
lizzy
from
the
door
of
her
house
with
the
greatest
possession
a
farmer
down
below
who
also
had
a
share
in
the
run
rode
about
with
one
eye
on
his
fields
and
the
other
on
latimer
and
his
myrmidons
prepared
to
put
them
off
the
scent
if
he
should
be
asked
a
question
stockdale
who
was
no
smuggler
at
all
felt
more
anxiety
than
the
worst
of
them
and
went
about
his
studies
with
a
heavy
heart
coming
frequently
to
the
door
to
ask
lizzy
some
question
or
other
on
the
consequences
to
her
of
the
tubs
being
found
consequences
she
said
quietly
simply
that
i
shall
lose
as
i
have
none
in
the
house
or
garden
they
ca
touch
me
personally
you
have
some
in
the
orchard
rents
that
of
me
and
he
lends
it
to
others
so
it
will
be
hard
to
say
who
put
any
tubs
there
if
they
should
be
found
there
was
never
such
a
tremendous
sniffing
known
as
that
which
took
place
in
parish
and
its
vicinity
this
day
all
was
done
methodically
and
mostly
on
hands
and
knees
at
different
hours
of
the
day
they
had
different
plans
from
daybreak
to
the
officers
used
their
sense
of
smell
in
a
direct
and
straightforward
manner
only
pausing
nowhere
but
at
such
places
as
the
tubs
might
be
supposed
to
be
secreted
in
at
that
very
moment
pending
their
removal
on
the
following
night
among
the
places
tested
and
examined
were
hollow
trees
cupboards
culverts
hedgerows
bedrooms
haystacks
pigsties
coppers
and
ovens
after
breakfast
they
recommenced
with
renewed
vigour
taking
a
new
line
that
is
to
say
directing
their
attention
to
clothes
that
might
be
supposed
to
have
come
in
contact
with
the
tubs
in
their
removal
from
the
shore
such
garments
being
usually
tainted
with
the
spirit
owing
to
its
oozing
between
the
staves
they
now
sniffed
at
smiths
and
shoemakers
aprons
old
shirts
and
waistcoats
and
coats
and
hats
tarpaulins
breeches
and
leggings
women
shawls
and
gowns
scarecrows
and
as
soon
as
the
meal
was
over
they
pushed
their
search
into
places
where
the
spirits
might
have
been
thrown
away
in
alarm
mixens
sinks
in
yards
wet
ditches
and
cesspools
gutters
but
still
these
indefatigable
excisemen
discovered
nothing
more
than
the
original
smell
in
the
road
opposite
lizzy
house
which
even
yet
had
not
passed
off
tell
ye
what
it
is
men
said
latimer
about
three
in
the
afternoon
must
begin
over
again
find
them
tubs
i
will
the
men
who
had
been
hired
for
the
day
looked
at
their
hands
and
knees
muddy
with
creeping
on
all
fours
so
frequently
and
rubbed
their
noses
as
if
they
had
almost
had
enough
of
it
for
the
quantity
of
bad
air
which
had
passed
into
each
one
nostril
had
rendered
it
nearly
as
insensible
as
a
flue
however
after
a
moment
hesitation
they
prepared
to
start
anew
except
three
whose
power
of
smell
had
quite
succumbed
under
the
excessive
wear
and
tear
of
the
day
by
this
time
not
a
male
villager
was
to
be
seen
in
the
parish
owlett
was
not
at
his
mill
the
farmers
were
not
in
their
fields
the
parson
was
not
in
his
garden
the
smith
had
left
his
forge
and
the
shop
was
silent
the
divil
are
the
folk
gone
said
latimer
waking
up
to
the
fact
of
their
absence
and
looking
round
have
up
for
this
why
do
they
come
and
help
us
there
not
a
man
about
the
place
but
the
methodist
parson
and
he
an
old
woman
i
demand
assistance
in
the
king
name
must
find
the
jineral
public
afore
we
can
demand
that
said
his
lieutenant
well
we
shall
do
better
without
said
latimer
who
changed
his
moods
at
a
moment
notice
there
great
cause
of
suspicion
in
this
silence
and
this
keeping
out
of
sight
and
i
bear
it
in
mind
now
we
will
go
across
to
owlett
orchard
and
see
what
we
can
find
there
stockdale
who
heard
this
discussion
from
the
over
which
he
had
been
leaning
was
rather
alarmed
and
thought
it
a
mistake
of
the
villagers
to
keep
so
completely
out
of
the
way
he
himself
like
the
excisemen
had
been
wondering
for
the
last
what
could
have
become
of
them
some
labourers
were
of
necessity
engaged
in
distant
fields
but
the
should
have
been
at
home
though
one
and
all
after
just
showing
themselves
at
their
shops
had
apparently
gone
off
for
the
day
he
went
in
to
lizzy
who
sat
at
a
back
window
sewing
and
said
where
are
the
men
lizzy
laughed
they
mostly
are
when
they
run
so
hard
as
this
she
cast
her
eyes
to
heaven
there
she
said
stockdale
looked
up
on
the
top
of
the
church
tower
he
asked
seeing
the
direction
of
her
glance
i
expect
they
will
soon
have
to
come
down
said
he
gravely
have
been
listening
to
the
officers
and
they
are
going
to
search
the
orchard
over
again
and
then
every
nook
in
the
church
lizzy
looked
alarmed
for
the
first
time
you
go
and
tell
our
folk
she
said
ought
to
be
let
know
seeing
his
conscience
struggling
within
him
like
a
boiling
pot
she
added
never
mind
i
go
myself
she
went
out
descended
the
garden
and
climbed
over
the
churchyard
wall
at
the
same
time
that
the
were
ascending
the
road
to
the
orchard
stockdale
could
do
no
less
than
follow
her
by
the
time
that
she
reached
the
tower
entrance
he
was
at
her
side
and
they
entered
together
was
as
in
many
villages
without
a
turret
and
the
only
way
to
the
top
was
by
going
up
to
the
singers
gallery
and
thence
ascending
by
a
ladder
to
a
square
in
the
floor
of
the
above
which
a
permanent
ladder
was
fixed
passing
through
the
bells
to
a
hole
in
the
roof
when
lizzy
and
stockdale
reached
the
gallery
and
looked
up
nothing
but
the
and
the
five
holes
for
the
appeared
the
ladder
was
gone
no
getting
up
said
stockdale
yes
there
is
said
she
an
eye
looking
at
us
at
this
moment
through
a
in
that
and
as
she
spoke
the
trap
opened
and
the
dark
line
of
the
ladder
was
seen
descending
against
the
wall
when
it
touched
the
bottom
lizzy
dragged
it
to
its
place
and
said
you
go
up
follow
the
young
man
ascended
and
presently
found
himself
among
consecrated
bells
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
nonconformity
having
been
in
the
stockdale
blood
for
some
generations
he
eyed
them
uneasily
and
looked
round
for
lizzy
owlett
stood
here
holding
the
top
of
the
ladder
be
you
really
one
of
us
said
the
miller
seems
so
said
stockdale
sadly
not
said
lizzy
who
overheard
neither
for
nor
against
us
he
do
us
no
harm
she
stepped
up
beside
them
and
then
they
went
on
to
the
next
stage
which
when
they
had
clambered
over
the
dusty
was
of
easy
ascent
leading
towards
the
hole
through
which
the
pale
sky
appeared
and
into
the
open
air
owlett
remained
behind
for
a
moment
to
pull
up
the
lower
ladder
down
your
heads
said
a
voice
as
soon
as
they
set
foot
on
the
flat
stockdale
here
beheld
all
the
missing
parishioners
lying
on
their
stomachs
on
the
tower
roof
except
a
few
who
elevated
on
their
hands
and
knees
were
peeping
through
the
embrasures
of
the
parapet
stockdale
did
the
same
and
saw
the
village
lying
like
a
map
below
him
over
which
moved
the
figures
of
the
excisemen
each
foreshortened
to
a
crablike
object
the
crown
of
his
hat
forming
a
circular
disc
in
the
centre
of
him
some
of
the
men
had
turned
their
heads
when
the
young
figure
arose
among
them
mr
stockdale
said
matt
grey
in
a
tone
of
surprise
as
lief
that
it
had
been
said
jim
clarke
the
should
see
him
a
trespassing
here
in
his
tower
be
none
the
better
for
we
seeing
how
do
hate
he
never
buy
a
tub
of
us
again
and
he
as
good
a
customer
as
we
have
got
this
side
warm
is
the
said
lizzy
his
house
to
be
sure
that
he
mid
see
nothing
of
what
going
on
where
all
good
folks
ought
to
be
and
this
young
man
likewise
he
has
brought
some
news
said
lizzy
are
going
to
search
the
orchet
and
church
can
we
do
anything
if
they
should
find
said
her
cousin
owlett
what
we
been
talking
o
and
we
have
settled
our
line
well
be
dazed
the
exclamation
was
caused
by
his
perceiving
that
some
of
the
searchers
having
got
into
the
orchard
and
begun
stooping
and
creeping
hither
and
thither
were
pausing
in
the
middle
where
a
tree
smaller
than
the
rest
was
growing
they
drew
closer
and
bent
lower
than
ever
upon
the
ground
my
tubs
said
lizzy
faintly
as
she
peered
through
the
parapet
at
them
have
got
said
owlett
the
interest
in
the
movements
of
the
officers
was
so
keen
that
not
a
single
eye
was
looking
in
any
other
direction
but
at
that
moment
a
shout
from
the
church
beneath
them
attracted
the
attention
of
the
smugglers
as
it
did
also
of
the
party
in
the
orchard
who
sprang
to
their
feet
and
went
towards
the
churchyard
wall
at
the
same
time
those
of
the
government
men
who
had
entered
the
church
unperceived
by
the
smugglers
cried
aloud
be
some
of
at
last
the
smugglers
remained
in
a
blank
silence
uncertain
whether
of
meant
tubs
or
men
but
again
peeping
cautiously
over
the
edge
of
the
tower
they
learnt
that
tubs
were
the
things
descried
and
soon
these
fated
articles
were
brought
one
by
one
into
the
middle
of
the
churchyard
from
their
under
the
are
going
to
put
on
hinton
vault
till
they
find
the
rest
said
lizzy
hopelessly
the
excisemen
had
in
fact
begun
to
pile
up
the
tubs
on
a
large
stone
slab
which
was
fixed
there
and
when
all
were
brought
out
from
the
tower
two
or
three
of
the
men
were
left
standing
by
them
the
rest
of
the
party
again
proceeding
to
the
orchard
the
interest
of
the
smugglers
in
the
next
manoeuvres
of
their
enemies
became
painfully
intense
only
about
thirty
tubs
had
been
secreted
in
the
lumber
of
the
tower
but
seventy
were
hidden
in
the
orchard
making
up
all
that
they
had
brought
ashore
as
yet
the
remainder
of
the
cargo
having
been
tied
to
a
sinker
and
dropped
overboard
for
another
operations
the
excisemen
having
the
orchard
acted
as
if
they
were
positive
that
here
lay
hidden
the
rest
of
the
tubs
which
they
were
determined
to
find
before
nightfall
they
spread
themselves
out
round
the
field
and
advancing
on
all
fours
as
before
went
anew
round
every
in
the
enclosure
the
young
tree
in
the
middle
again
led
them
to
pause
and
at
length
the
whole
company
gathered
there
in
a
way
which
signified
that
a
second
chain
of
reasoning
had
led
to
the
same
results
as
the
first
when
they
had
examined
the
sod
hereabouts
for
some
minutes
one
of
the
men
rose
ran
to
a
disused
porch
of
the
church
where
tools
were
kept
and
returned
with
the
sexton
pickaxe
and
shovel
with
which
they
set
to
work
they
really
buried
there
said
the
minister
for
the
grass
was
so
green
and
uninjured
that
it
was
difficult
to
believe
it
had
been
disturbed
the
smugglers
were
too
interested
to
reply
and
presently
they
saw
to
their
chagrin
the
officers
stand
several
on
each
side
of
the
tree
and
stooping
and
applying
their
hands
to
the
soil
they
bodily
lifted
the
tree
and
the
turf
around
it
the
now
showed
itself
to
be
growing
in
a
shallow
box
with
handles
for
lifting
at
each
of
the
four
sides
under
the
site
of
the
tree
a
square
hole
was
revealed
and
an
exciseman
went
and
looked
down
is
all
up
now
said
owlett
quietly
now
all
of
ye
get
down
before
they
notice
we
are
here
and
be
ready
for
our
next
move
i
had
better
bide
here
till
dark
or
they
may
take
me
on
suspicion
as
is
on
my
ground
i
be
with
ye
as
soon
as
daylight
begins
to
pink
in
i
said
lizzy
please
look
to
the
and
screws
then
go
indoors
and
know
nothing
at
all
the
chaps
will
do
the
rest
the
ladder
was
replaced
and
all
but
owlett
descended
the
men
passing
off
one
by
one
at
the
back
of
the
church
and
vanishing
on
their
respective
errands
lizzy
walked
boldly
along
the
street
followed
closely
by
the
minister
are
going
indoors
mrs
newberry
he
said
she
knew
from
the
words
newberry
that
the
division
between
them
had
widened
yet
another
degree
am
not
going
home
she
said
have
a
little
thing
to
do
before
i
go
in
martha
sarah
will
get
your
tea
i
do
mean
on
that
account
said
stockdale
can
you
have
to
do
further
in
this
unhallowed
affair
a
little
she
said
is
that
i
go
with
you
i
shall
go
by
myself
will
you
please
go
indoors
i
shall
be
there
in
less
than
an
hour
are
not
going
to
run
any
danger
lizzy
said
the
young
man
his
tenderness
reasserting
itself
whatever
worth
mentioning
answered
she
and
went
down
towards
the
cross
stockdale
entered
the
garden
gate
and
stood
behind
it
looking
on
the
excisemen
were
still
busy
in
the
orchard
and
at
last
he
was
tempted
to
enter
and
watch
their
proceedings
when
he
came
closer
he
found
that
the
secret
cellar
of
whose
existence
he
had
been
totally
unaware
was
formed
by
timbers
placed
across
from
side
to
side
about
a
foot
under
the
ground
and
grassed
over
the
excisemen
looked
up
at
stockdale
fair
and
downy
countenance
and
evidently
thinking
him
above
suspicion
went
on
with
their
work
again
as
soon
as
all
the
tubs
were
taken
out
they
began
tearing
up
the
turf
pulling
out
the
timbers
and
breaking
in
the
sides
till
the
cellar
was
wholly
dismantled
and
shapeless
the
lying
with
its
roots
high
to
the
air
but
the
hole
which
had
in
its
time
held
so
much
contraband
merchandize
was
never
completely
filled
up
either
then
or
afterwards
a
depression
in
the
greensward
marking
the
spot
to
this
day
chapter
vii
the
walk
to
cross
and
afterwards
as
the
goods
had
all
to
be
carried
to
budmouth
that
night
the
excisemen
next
object
was
to
find
horses
and
carts
for
the
journey
and
they
went
about
the
village
for
that
purpose
latimer
strode
hither
and
thither
with
a
lump
of
chalk
in
his
hand
marking
so
vigorously
on
every
vehicle
and
set
of
harness
that
he
came
across
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
chalk
on
the
very
hedges
and
roads
the
owner
of
every
conveyance
so
marked
was
bound
to
give
it
up
for
government
purposes
stockdale
who
had
had
enough
of
the
scene
turned
indoors
thoughtful
and
depressed
lizzy
was
already
there
having
come
in
at
the
back
though
she
had
not
yet
taken
off
her
bonnet
she
looked
tired
and
her
mood
was
not
much
brighter
than
his
own
they
had
but
little
to
say
to
each
other
and
the
minister
went
away
and
attempted
to
read
but
at
this
he
could
not
succeed
and
he
shook
the
little
bell
for
tea
lizzy
herself
brought
in
the
tray
the
girl
having
run
off
into
the
village
during
the
afternoon
too
full
of
excitement
at
the
proceedings
to
remember
her
state
of
life
however
almost
before
the
sad
lovers
had
said
anything
to
each
other
martha
came
in
in
a
steaming
state
there
such
a
stoor
newberry
and
stockdale
the
excisemen
ca
get
the
carts
ready
nohow
at
all
they
pulled
thomas
ballam
and
william
rogers
and
stephen
sprake
carts
into
the
road
and
off
came
the
wheels
and
down
fell
the
carts
and
they
found
there
was
no
in
the
arms
and
then
they
tried
samuel
shane
waggon
and
found
that
the
screws
were
gone
from
he
and
at
last
they
looked
at
the
dairyman
cart
and
he
got
none
neither
they
have
gone
now
to
the
blacksmith
to
get
some
made
but
he
nowhere
to
be
found
stockdale
looked
at
lizzy
who
blushed
very
slightly
and
went
out
of
the
room
followed
by
martha
sarah
but
before
they
had
got
through
the
passage
there
was
a
rap
at
the
front
door
and
stockdale
recognized
latimer
voice
addressing
newberry
who
had
turned
back
god
sake
newberry
have
you
seen
hardman
the
blacksmith
up
this
way
if
we
could
get
hold
of
him
we
drag
him
by
the
hair
of
his
head
to
his
anvil
where
he
ought
to
be
an
idle
man
latimer
said
lizzy
archly
do
you
want
him
for
there
is
a
horse
in
the
place
that
has
got
more
than
three
shoes
on
and
some
have
only
two
the
be
without
strakes
and
there
no
to
the
carts
what
with
that
and
the
bother
about
every
set
of
harness
being
out
of
order
we
sha
be
off
before
nightfall
upon
my
soul
we
sha
is
a
rough
lot
newberry
that
you
got
about
you
here
but
they
play
at
this
game
once
too
often
mark
my
words
they
will
there
not
a
man
in
the
parish
that
deserve
to
be
whipped
it
happened
that
hardman
was
at
that
moment
a
little
further
up
the
lane
smoking
his
pipe
behind
a
when
latimer
had
done
speaking
he
went
on
in
this
direction
and
hardman
hearing
the
exciseman
steps
found
curiosity
too
strong
for
prudence
he
peeped
out
from
the
bush
at
the
very
moment
that
latimer
glance
was
on
it
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
but
to
come
forward
with
unconcern
been
looking
for
you
for
the
last
hour
said
latimer
with
a
glare
in
his
eye
to
hear
that
said
hardman
been
out
for
a
stroll
to
look
for
more
hid
tubs
to
deliver
up
to
yes
hardman
we
know
it
said
latimer
with
withering
sarcasm
know
that
you
deliver
up
to
we
know
that
all
the
parish
is
helping
us
and
have
been
all
day
now
you
please
walk
along
with
me
down
to
your
shop
and
kindly
let
me
hire
ye
in
the
king
name
they
went
down
the
lane
together
and
presently
there
resounded
from
the
smithy
the
ring
of
a
hammer
not
very
briskly
swung
however
the
carts
and
horses
were
got
into
some
sort
of
travelling
condition
but
it
was
not
until
after
the
clock
had
struck
six
when
the
muddy
roads
were
glistening
under
the
horizontal
light
of
the
fading
day
the
smuggled
tubs
were
soon
packed
into
the
vehicles
and
latimer
with
three
of
his
assistants
drove
slowly
out
of
the
village
in
the
direction
of
the
port
of
budmouth
some
considerable
number
of
miles
distant
the
other
excisemen
being
left
to
watch
for
the
remainder
of
the
cargo
which
they
knew
to
have
been
sunk
somewhere
between
ringsworth
and
lulstead
cove
and
to
unearth
owlett
the
only
person
clearly
implicated
by
the
discovery
of
the
cave
women
and
children
stood
at
the
doors
as
the
carts
each
chalked
with
the
government
pitchfork
passed
in
the
increasing
twilight
and
as
they
stood
they
looked
at
the
confiscated
property
with
a
melancholy
expression
that
told
only
too
plainly
the
relation
which
they
bore
to
the
trade
lizzy
said
stockdale
when
the
crackle
of
the
wheels
had
nearly
died
away
is
a
fit
finish
to
your
adventure
i
am
truly
thankful
that
you
have
got
off
without
suspicion
and
the
loss
only
of
the
liquor
will
you
sit
down
and
let
me
talk
to
you
and
by
she
said
i
must
go
out
now
to
that
horrid
shore
again
he
said
blankly
not
there
i
am
only
going
to
see
the
end
of
this
day
business
he
did
not
answer
to
this
and
she
moved
towards
the
door
slowly
as
if
waiting
for
him
to
say
something
more
do
offer
to
come
with
me
she
added
at
last
suppose
because
you
hate
me
after
all
this
you
say
it
lizzy
when
you
know
i
only
want
to
save
you
from
such
practices
come
with
you
of
course
i
will
if
it
is
only
to
take
care
of
you
but
why
will
you
go
out
again
i
can
not
rest
indoors
something
is
happening
and
i
must
know
what
now
come
and
they
went
into
the
dusk
together
when
they
reached
the
she
turned
to
the
right
and
he
soon
perceived
that
they
were
following
the
direction
of
the
excisemen
and
their
load
he
had
given
her
his
arm
and
every
now
and
then
she
suddenly
pulled
it
back
to
signify
that
he
was
to
halt
a
moment
and
listen
they
had
walked
rather
quickly
along
the
first
quarter
of
a
mile
and
on
the
second
or
third
time
of
standing
still
she
said
hear
them
ahead
do
you
he
said
hear
the
wheels
but
what
of
that
only
want
to
know
if
they
get
clear
away
from
the
neighbourhood
said
he
a
light
breaking
upon
him
desperate
is
to
be
attempted
and
now
i
remember
there
was
not
a
man
about
the
village
when
we
left
she
murmured
the
noise
of
the
cartwheels
had
stopped
and
given
place
to
another
sort
of
sound
a
scuffle
said
stockdale
be
murder
lizzy
let
go
my
arm
i
am
going
on
on
my
conscience
i
must
not
stay
here
and
do
nothing
be
no
murder
and
not
even
a
broken
head
she
said
men
are
thirty
to
four
of
them
no
harm
will
be
done
at
all
there
is
an
attack
exclaimed
stockdale
you
knew
it
was
to
be
why
should
you
side
with
men
who
break
the
laws
like
this
should
you
side
with
men
who
take
from
country
traders
what
they
have
honestly
bought
wi
their
own
money
in
france
said
she
firmly
are
not
honestly
bought
said
he
are
she
contradicted
and
owlett
and
the
others
paid
thirty
shillings
for
every
one
of
the
tubs
before
they
were
put
on
board
at
cherbourg
and
if
a
king
who
is
nothing
to
us
sends
his
people
to
steal
our
property
we
have
a
right
to
steal
it
back
again
stockdale
did
not
stop
to
argue
the
matter
but
went
quickly
in
the
direction
of
the
noise
lizzy
keeping
at
his
side
you
interfere
will
you
dear
richard
she
said
anxiously
as
they
drew
near
let
us
go
any
closer
is
at
cross
where
they
are
seizing
you
can
do
no
good
and
you
may
meet
with
a
hard
blow
us
see
first
what
is
going
on
he
said
but
before
they
had
got
much
further
the
noise
of
the
cartwheels
began
again
and
stockdale
soon
found
that
they
were
coming
towards
him
in
another
minute
the
three
carts
came
up
and
stockdale
and
lizzy
stood
in
the
ditch
to
let
them
pass
instead
of
being
conducted
by
four
men
as
had
happened
when
they
went
out
of
the
village
the
horses
and
carts
were
now
accompanied
by
a
body
of
from
twenty
to
thirty
all
of
whom
as
stockdale
perceived
to
his
astonishment
had
blackened
faces
among
them
walked
six
or
eight
huge
female
figures
whom
from
their
wide
strides
stockdale
guessed
to
be
men
in
disguise
as
soon
as
the
party
discerned
lizzy
and
her
companion
four
or
five
fell
back
and
when
the
carts
had
passed
came
close
to
the
pair
is
no
walking
up
this
way
for
the
present
said
one
of
the
gaunt
women
who
wore
curls
a
foot
long
dangling
down
the
sides
of
her
face
in
the
fashion
of
the
time
stockdale
recognized
this
lady
voice
as
owlett
not
said
stockdale
is
the
public
highway
look
here
youngster
said
owlett
is
the
methodist
parson
what
and
newberry
well
you
better
not
go
up
that
way
lizzy
they
all
run
off
and
folks
have
got
their
own
again
the
miller
then
hastened
on
and
joined
his
comrades
stockdale
and
lizzy
also
turned
back
wish
all
this
had
been
forced
upon
us
she
said
regretfully
if
those
excisemen
had
got
off
with
the
tubs
half
the
people
in
the
parish
would
have
been
in
want
for
the
next
month
or
two
stockdale
was
not
paying
much
attention
to
her
words
and
he
said
do
think
i
can
go
back
like
this
those
four
poor
excisemen
may
be
murdered
for
all
i
know
said
lizzy
impatiently
do
do
murder
here
i
shall
go
as
far
as
cross
to
see
said
stockdale
decisively
and
without
wishing
her
safe
home
or
anything
else
the
minister
turned
back
lizzy
stood
looking
at
him
till
his
form
was
absorbed
in
the
shades
and
then
with
sadness
she
went
in
the
direction
of
the
road
was
lonely
and
after
nightfall
at
this
time
of
the
year
there
was
often
not
a
passer
for
hours
stockdale
pursued
his
way
without
hearing
a
sound
beyond
that
of
his
own
footsteps
and
in
due
time
he
passed
beneath
the
trees
of
the
plantation
which
surrounded
the
before
he
had
reached
the
point
of
intersection
he
heard
voices
from
the
thicket
help
help
the
voices
were
not
at
all
feeble
or
despairing
but
they
were
unmistakably
anxious
stockdale
had
no
weapon
and
before
plunging
into
the
pitchy
darkness
of
the
plantation
he
pulled
a
stake
from
the
hedge
to
use
in
case
of
need
when
he
got
among
the
trees
he
shouted
the
matter
where
are
you
answered
the
voices
and
pushing
through
the
brambles
in
that
direction
he
came
near
the
objects
of
his
search
do
you
come
forward
said
stockdale
be
tied
to
the
trees
are
you
will
latimer
the
exciseman
said
one
plaintively
come
and
cut
these
cords
there
a
good
man
we
were
afraid
nobody
would
pass
by
stockdale
soon
loosened
them
upon
which
they
stretched
their
limbs
and
stood
at
their
ease
rascals
said
latimer
getting
now
into
a
rage
though
he
had
seemed
quite
meek
when
stockdale
first
came
up
the
same
set
of
fellows
i
know
they
were
moynton
chaps
to
a
man
we
ca
swear
to
said
another
one
of
spoke
are
you
going
to
do
said
stockdale
fain
go
back
to
moynton
and
have
at
again
said
latimer
would
we
said
his
comrades
till
we
die
said
latimer
will
we
will
said
his
men
said
latimer
more
frigidly
as
they
came
out
of
the
plantation
do
know
that
these
chaps
with
black
faces
were
moynton
men
and
proof
is
a
hard
thing
it
is
said
the
rest
therefore
we
wo
do
nothing
at
all
said
latimer
with
complete
dispassionateness
my
part
i
sooner
be
them
than
we
the
clitches
of
my
arms
are
burning
like
fire
from
the
cords
those
two
strapping
women
tied
round
my
opinion
is
now
i
have
had
time
to
think
that
you
may
serve
your
at
too
high
a
price
for
these
two
nights
and
days
i
have
not
had
an
hour
rest
and
please
god
here
for
the
other
officers
agreed
heartily
to
this
course
and
thanking
stockdale
for
his
timely
assistance
they
parted
from
him
at
the
cross
taking
themselves
the
western
road
and
stockdale
going
back
to
moynton
during
that
walk
the
minister
was
lost
in
reverie
of
the
most
painful
kind
as
soon
as
he
got
into
the
house
and
before
entering
his
own
rooms
he
advanced
to
the
door
of
the
little
back
parlour
in
which
lizzy
usually
sat
with
her
mother
he
found
her
there
alone
stockdale
went
forward
and
like
a
man
in
a
dream
looked
down
upon
the
table
that
stood
between
him
and
the
young
woman
who
had
her
bonnet
and
cloak
still
on
as
he
did
not
speak
she
looked
up
from
her
chair
at
him
with
misgiving
in
her
eye
are
they
gone
he
then
said
listlessly
i
do
know
i
have
seen
nothing
of
them
since
i
came
straight
in
here
your
men
can
manage
to
get
off
with
those
tubs
it
will
be
a
great
profit
to
you
i
suppose
share
will
be
mine
a
share
my
cousin
owlett
a
share
to
each
of
the
two
farmers
and
a
share
divided
amongst
the
men
who
helped
us
you
still
think
he
went
on
slowly
you
will
not
give
this
business
up
lizzy
rose
and
put
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
ask
that
she
whispered
do
know
what
you
are
asking
i
must
tell
you
though
i
meant
not
to
do
it
what
i
make
by
that
trade
is
all
i
have
to
keep
my
mother
and
myself
with
he
was
astonished
did
not
dream
of
such
a
thing
he
said
would
rather
have
swept
the
streets
had
i
been
you
what
is
money
compared
with
a
clear
conscience
conscience
is
clear
i
know
my
mother
but
the
king
i
have
never
seen
his
dues
are
nothing
to
me
but
it
is
a
great
deal
to
me
that
my
mother
and
i
should
live
me
and
promise
to
give
it
up
i
will
keep
your
mother
is
good
of
you
she
said
trembling
a
little
me
think
of
it
by
myself
i
would
rather
not
answer
now
she
reserved
her
answer
till
the
next
day
and
came
into
his
room
with
a
solemn
face
can
not
do
what
you
wished
she
said
passionately
is
too
much
to
ask
my
whole
life
ha
been
passed
in
this
way
her
words
and
manner
showed
that
before
entering
she
had
been
struggling
with
herself
in
private
and
that
the
contention
had
been
strong
stockdale
turned
pale
but
he
spoke
quietly
lizzy
we
must
part
i
can
not
go
against
my
principles
in
this
matter
and
i
can
not
make
my
profession
a
mockery
you
know
how
i
love
you
and
what
i
would
do
for
you
but
this
one
thing
i
can
not
do
why
should
you
belong
to
that
profession
she
burst
out
have
got
this
large
house
why
ca
you
marry
me
and
live
here
with
us
and
not
be
a
methodist
preacher
any
more
i
assure
you
richard
it
is
no
harm
and
i
wish
you
could
only
see
it
as
i
do
we
only
carry
it
on
in
winter
in
summer
it
is
never
done
at
all
it
stirs
up
one
dull
life
at
this
time
o
the
year
and
gives
excitement
which
i
have
got
so
used
to
now
that
i
should
hardly
know
how
to
do
it
at
nights
when
the
wind
blows
instead
of
being
dull
and
stupid
and
not
noticing
whether
it
do
blow
or
not
your
mind
is
afield
even
if
you
are
not
afield
yourself
and
you
are
wondering
how
the
chaps
are
getting
on
and
you
walk
up
and
down
the
room
and
look
out
o
window
and
then
you
go
out
yourself
and
know
your
way
about
as
well
by
night
as
by
day
and
have
hairbreadth
escapes
from
old
latimer
and
his
fellows
who
are
too
stupid
ever
to
really
frighten
us
and
only
make
us
a
bit
nimble
frightened
you
a
little
last
night
anyhow
and
i
would
advise
you
to
drop
it
before
it
is
worse
she
shook
her
head
i
must
go
on
as
i
have
begun
i
was
born
to
it
it
is
in
my
blood
and
i
ca
be
cured
o
richard
you
can
not
think
what
a
hard
thing
you
have
asked
and
how
sharp
you
try
me
when
you
put
me
between
this
and
my
love
for
stockdale
was
leaning
with
his
elbow
on
the
mantelpiece
his
hands
over
his
eyes
ought
never
to
have
met
lizzy
he
said
was
an
ill
day
for
us
i
little
thought
there
was
anything
so
hopeless
and
impossible
in
our
engagement
as
this
well
it
is
too
late
now
to
regret
consequences
in
this
way
i
have
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
you
and
knowing
you
at
least
dissent
from
church
and
i
dissent
from
state
she
said
i
do
see
why
we
are
not
well
matched
he
smiled
sadly
while
lizzy
remained
looking
down
her
eyes
beginning
to
overflow
that
was
an
unhappy
evening
for
both
of
them
and
the
days
that
followed
were
unhappy
days
both
she
and
he
went
mechanically
about
their
employments
and
his
depression
was
marked
in
the
village
by
more
than
one
of
his
denomination
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
but
lizzy
who
passed
her
days
indoors
was
unsuspected
of
being
the
cause
for
it
was
generally
understood
that
a
quiet
engagement
to
marry
existed
between
her
and
her
cousin
owlett
and
had
existed
for
some
time
thus
uncertainly
the
week
passed
on
till
one
morning
stockdale
said
to
her
have
had
a
letter
lizzy
i
must
call
you
that
till
i
am
gone
said
she
blankly
he
said
am
going
from
this
place
i
felt
it
would
be
better
for
us
both
that
i
should
not
stay
after
what
has
happened
in
fact
i
could
stay
here
and
look
on
you
from
day
to
day
without
becoming
weak
and
faltering
in
my
course
i
have
just
heard
of
an
arrangement
by
which
the
other
minister
can
arrive
here
in
about
a
week
and
let
me
go
elsewhere
that
he
had
all
this
time
continued
so
firmly
fixed
in
his
resolution
came
upon
her
as
a
grievous
surprise
never
loved
me
she
said
bitterly
might
say
the
same
he
returned
i
will
not
grant
me
one
favour
come
and
hear
my
last
sermon
on
the
day
before
i
go
lizzy
who
was
a
on
sunday
mornings
frequently
attended
stockdale
chapel
in
the
evening
with
the
rest
of
the
and
she
promised
it
became
known
that
stockdale
was
going
to
leave
and
a
good
many
people
outside
his
own
sect
were
sorry
to
hear
it
the
intervening
days
flew
rapidly
away
and
on
the
evening
of
the
sunday
which
preceded
the
morning
of
his
departure
lizzy
sat
in
the
chapel
to
hear
him
for
the
last
time
the
little
building
was
full
to
overflowing
and
he
took
up
the
subject
which
all
had
expected
that
of
the
contraband
trade
so
extensively
practised
among
them
his
hearers
in
laying
his
words
to
their
own
hearts
did
not
perceive
that
they
were
most
particularly
directed
against
lizzy
till
the
sermon
waxed
warm
and
stockdale
nearly
broke
down
with
emotion
in
truth
his
own
earnestness
and
her
sad
eyes
looking
up
at
him
were
too
much
for
the
young
man
equanimity
he
hardly
knew
how
he
ended
he
saw
lizzy
as
through
a
mist
turn
and
go
away
with
the
rest
of
the
congregation
and
shortly
afterwards
followed
her
home
she
invited
him
to
supper
and
they
sat
down
alone
her
mother
having
as
was
usual
with
her
on
sunday
nights
gone
to
bed
early
will
part
friends
wo
we
said
lizzy
with
forced
gaiety
and
never
alluding
to
the
sermon
a
reticence
which
rather
disappointed
him
will
he
said
with
a
forced
smile
on
his
part
and
they
sat
down
it
was
the
first
meal
that
they
had
ever
shared
together
in
their
lives
and
probably
the
last
that
they
would
so
share
when
it
was
over
and
the
indifferent
conversation
could
no
longer
be
continued
he
arose
and
took
her
hand
he
said
you
say
we
must
part
do
you
do
she
said
solemnly
can
say
no
more
i
said
he
that
is
your
answer
stockdale
bent
over
her
and
kissed
her
and
she
involuntarily
returned
his
kiss
shall
go
early
he
said
hurriedly
shall
not
see
you
again
and
he
did
leave
early
he
fancied
when
stepping
forth
into
the
grey
morning
light
to
mount
the
van
which
was
to
carry
him
away
that
he
saw
a
face
between
the
parted
curtains
of
lizzy
window
but
the
light
was
faint
and
the
panes
glistened
with
wet
so
he
could
not
be
sure
stockdale
mounted
the
vehicle
and
was
gone
and
on
the
following
sunday
the
new
minister
preached
in
the
chapel
of
the
moynton
wesleyans
one
day
two
years
after
the
parting
stockdale
now
settled
in
a
midland
town
came
into
by
carrier
in
the
original
way
jogging
along
in
the
van
that
afternoon
he
had
put
questions
to
the
driver
and
the
answers
that
he
received
interested
the
minister
deeply
the
result
of
them
was
that
he
went
without
the
least
hesitation
to
the
door
of
his
former
lodging
it
was
about
six
in
the
evening
and
the
same
time
of
year
as
when
he
had
left
now
too
the
ground
was
damp
and
glistening
the
west
was
bright
and
lizzy
snowdrops
were
raising
their
heads
in
the
border
under
the
wall
lizzy
must
have
caught
sight
of
him
from
the
window
for
by
the
time
that
he
reached
the
door
she
was
there
holding
it
open
and
then
as
if
she
had
not
sufficiently
considered
her
act
of
coming
out
she
drew
herself
back
saying
with
some
constraint
stockdale
knew
it
was
said
stockdale
taking
her
hand
wrote
to
say
i
should
call
but
you
did
not
say
when
she
answered
did
not
i
was
not
quite
sure
when
my
business
would
lead
me
to
these
parts
only
came
because
business
brought
you
near
that
is
the
fact
but
i
have
often
thought
i
should
like
to
come
on
purpose
to
see
you
but
what
all
this
that
has
happened
i
told
you
how
it
would
be
lizzy
and
you
would
not
listen
to
me
would
not
she
said
sadly
i
had
been
brought
up
to
that
life
and
it
was
second
nature
to
me
however
it
is
all
over
now
the
officers
have
for
taking
a
man
dead
or
alive
and
the
trade
is
going
to
nothing
we
were
hunted
down
like
rats
is
quite
gone
i
hear
he
is
in
america
we
had
a
dreadful
struggle
that
last
time
when
they
tried
to
take
him
it
is
a
perfect
miracle
that
he
lived
through
it
and
it
is
a
wonder
that
i
was
not
killed
i
was
shot
in
the
hand
it
was
not
by
aim
the
shot
was
really
meant
for
my
cousin
but
i
was
behind
looking
on
as
usual
and
the
bullet
came
to
me
it
bled
terribly
but
i
got
home
without
fainting
and
it
healed
after
a
time
you
know
how
he
suffered
said
stockdale
only
heard
that
he
just
escaped
with
his
life
was
shot
in
the
back
but
a
rib
turned
the
ball
he
was
badly
hurt
we
would
not
let
him
be
took
the
men
carried
him
all
night
across
the
meads
to
kingsbere
and
hid
him
in
a
barn
dressing
