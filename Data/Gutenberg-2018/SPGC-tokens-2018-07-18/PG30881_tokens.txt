the
girl
next
door
summit
avenue
was
the
prettiest
street
in
berwick
spacious
and
homes
stood
on
either
side
of
it
each
in
its
setting
of
lawn
and
shade
trees
most
of
these
showed
no
dividing
fences
or
hedges
and
boundaries
were
indiscernible
in
the
green
velvety
sward
that
swept
in
a
gentle
slope
to
the
sidewalk
of
two
neighbouring
houses
the
side
windows
faced
each
other
across
two
hundred
feet
of
intervening
turf
the
windows
of
one
house
were
duly
fitted
with
holland
shades
and
clean
fresh
white
curtains
for
it
was
may
and
berwick
ladies
were
rarely
dilatory
with
their
but
the
other
house
showed
no
window
dressings
and
the
sashes
were
flung
open
to
the
sunny
breeze
which
entering
found
rugless
floors
and
pictureless
walls
but
at
the
open
front
doors
other
things
were
entering
beds
chairs
tables
boxes
and
barrels
all
the
contents
of
the
great
moving
vans
that
stood
out
at
the
curb
strong
men
carried
incredibly
heavy
burdens
of
furniture
or
carefully
manoeuvred
glass
cabinets
or
potted
palms
from
behind
the
lace
curtains
of
the
other
house
people
were
watching
this
was
in
no
way
a
breach
of
good
manners
for
in
berwick
the
unwritten
law
of
neighbours
rights
freely
permitted
the
inspection
of
the
arriving
household
gods
of
a
new
family
but
etiquette
demanded
that
the
observers
discreetly
veil
themselves
behind
the
sheltering
films
of
their
own
curtains
and
so
the
fayres
mother
and
two
daughters
watched
with
interest
the
coming
of
the
roses
rose
what
a
funny
name
commented
dolly
fayre
the
younger
of
the
sisters
do
you
they
name
the
children
moss
and
tea
and
things
like
that
yes
and
killarney
and
sunburst
and
prince
camille
de
rohan
said
trudy
who
had
been
studying
florists
catalogues
of
late
their
library
furniture
is
mission
there
goes
the
table
and
fayre
noted
details
with
a
housekeeper
eye
and
here
comes
the
piano
i
ca
bear
to
see
men
move
a
piano
i
always
think
it
going
to
fall
on
them
i
tired
of
seeing
furniture
go
in
anyway
and
dolly
jumped
up
from
her
kneeling
position
i
rather
see
the
people
do
you
there
anybody
my
age
mums
i
do
know
dolly
your
father
only
said
their
name
was
rose
and
not
another
word
about
them
there
a
little
girl
anyway
asserted
trudy
they
took
in
a
big
doll
carriage
some
time
ago
trudy
was
nineteen
and
dolly
not
quite
fifteen
so
the
girls
while
chummy
as
sisters
had
few
interests
in
common
dolly
wandered
away
leaving
the
other
two
to
continue
their
appraisal
of
the
new
neighbours
she
went
to
her
own
room
which
also
looked
out
toward
the
roses
house
idly
glancing
that
way
from
her
window
she
saw
a
girl
face
in
a
window
next
door
she
seemed
about
dolly
age
and
she
had
a
pretty
bright
face
with
a
mop
of
curly
black
hair
she
wore
a
red
dress
and
a
red
and
she
made
a
vivid
picture
framed
in
the
open
window
dolly
looked
through
the
scrim
of
her
bedroom
curtain
and
then
to
see
better
moved
the
curtain
aside
and
watched
the
girl
dolly
herself
could
not
be
seen
because
of
the
dark
wire
window
screen
and
she
looked
at
the
stranger
with
increasing
interest
at
last
the
new
girl
put
one
foot
over
the
window
sill
and
then
the
other
and
sat
with
her
feet
crossed
and
kicking
against
the
side
of
the
house
it
was
a
first
floor
window
and
there
was
little
danger
of
her
falling
out
but
she
stretched
out
her
arms
and
held
the
window
frame
on
either
side
dolly
judged
the
girl
must
be
about
her
own
age
for
she
looked
so
and
too
her
dress
came
nearly
but
not
quite
to
her
shoetops
which
was
the
prescribed
length
of
dolly
own
it
was
a
pleasant
outlook
if
this
new
neighbour
should
be
a
nice
girl
dolly
foresaw
lots
of
good
times
for
most
of
her
girl
friends
lived
at
some
distance
the
nearest
several
blocks
away
and
to
have
a
chum
next
door
would
be
fine
but
was
she
a
nice
girl
dolly
had
been
punctiliously
brought
up
and
a
girl
who
sat
in
a
window
and
swung
her
feet
over
the
sill
was
a
bit
unconventional
in
berwick
dolly
was
seized
with
a
strong
desire
to
meet
this
girl
to
see
her
nearer
by
and
to
talk
with
her
but
dolly
was
timid
beside
her
careful
education
in
deportment
she
was
naturally
shy
and
reticent
she
was
sure
she
never
could
make
any
advances
to
become
acquainted
with
this
new
girl
and
yet
she
did
want
to
know
her
she
went
back
to
her
mother
and
sister
there
an
awful
big
picture
trudy
was
saying
it
all
burlapped
up
so
you
ca
tell
what
it
is
it
easy
to
judge
people
from
their
pictures
trudy
had
graduated
the
year
before
from
a
large
and
fine
girls
school
and
she
knew
all
about
pictures
i
think
you
can
tell
more
by
chairs
fayre
said
their
easy
chairs
are
very
good
ones
i
think
they
very
nice
people
have
you
seen
the
girl
in
the
window
asked
dolly
she
just
about
my
size
so
she
is
said
fayre
glancing
at
dolly
and
then
returning
to
her
study
of
the
chairs
when
can
i
go
to
see
her
mother
oh
trudy
and
i
will
call
there
in
a
fortnight
or
so
and
after
that
you
can
go
to
see
the
little
girl
or
i
ask
her
mother
to
bring
her
over
here
you
children
need
be
formal
but
ca
i
go
over
there
mercy
no
child
not
the
day
they
arrive
they
think
we
were
crazy
dolly
went
out
on
the
side
verandah
the
girl
still
sat
in
the
window
she
was
frankly
staring
and
so
every
time
dolly
caught
her
eye
the
straightforward
gaze
was
so
disconcerting
that
dolly
looked
away
quickly
and
pretended
to
be
engrossed
in
something
else
but
at
last
with
a
determined
effort
to
overcome
her
timidity
she
concluded
she
would
look
over
at
the
girl
and
smile
it
could
be
wrong
merely
to
smile
at
a
new
girl
if
it
was
the
very
day
she
arrived
they
could
think
her
crazy
for
that
but
to
conclude
to
do
this
and
to
do
it
were
two
very
different
matters
for
dolly
fayre
half
a
dozen
times
she
almost
raised
her
eyes
her
smile
all
ready
to
break
out
and
then
it
would
seem
too
much
to
dare
and
with
a
deep
blush
she
would
turn
again
toward
her
own
house
but
it
was
nearing
luncheon
time
and
dolly
made
a
last
desperate
effort
to
screw
her
courage
to
the
sticking
point
with
a
determined
jerk
she
wheeled
around
and
smiled
broadly
at
the
new
girl
to
her
amazement
the
pretty
face
scowled
at
her
definitely
and
distinctly
scowled
dolly
could
scarcely
believe
her
eyes
why
should
this
stranger
scowl
at
her
when
she
did
know
her
at
all
dolly
quickly
looked
away
and
pondered
over
the
matter
she
felt
less
shy
now
because
she
was
angry
then
the
bell
rang
for
luncheon
dolly
started
for
the
house
but
unable
to
resist
a
final
impulse
she
glanced
again
at
the
girl
in
the
window
the
girl
shook
her
head
at
her
it
was
a
quick
saucy
sideways
shake
as
if
dolly
had
asked
her
something
and
she
had
refused
the
pretty
face
looked
pettish
and
the
black
eyes
snapped
as
she
vigorously
shook
her
curly
head
pooh
said
dolly
to
herself
wait
till
you
asked
miss
i
want
anything
of
you
dolly
went
into
the
house
and
at
the
lunch
table
she
told
her
mother
and
trudy
of
the
girl
actions
i
thought
she
looked
saucy
said
trudy
and
the
subject
was
dropped
in
the
meantime
the
girl
next
door
had
drawn
in
her
feet
and
jumped
down
from
the
window
what
a
funny
lunch
she
exclaimed
as
she
ran
into
the
looks
good
though
and
she
sat
down
on
a
and
took
the
plate
her
mother
offered
yes
it
a
sort
of
picnic
said
rose
everything
cold
but
it
does
taste
good
the
was
unfurnished
though
the
table
and
chairs
were
in
it
they
were
still
burlapped
and
the
barrels
of
dishes
were
not
yet
unpacked
rose
and
her
sister
bayliss
sat
on
too
and
made
merry
at
their
own
discomfort
seems
we
never
get
straightened
out
said
rose
taking
another
sandwich
on
her
plate
but
i
we
will
it
always
like
this
when
you
move
thank
goodness
george
is
coming
home
early
such
a
help
yes
he
is
agreed
bayliss
what
lovely
fresh
radishes
take
some
more
do
you
know
any
one
at
all
in
berwick
molly
no
one
at
all
george
liked
the
place
and
he
bought
this
house
from
an
agent
but
i
sha
hasten
to
make
acquaintances
i
believe
in
going
slow
in
such
matters
the
neighbours
will
probably
call
after
a
few
weeks
and
then
we
see
what
they
like
the
people
next
door
have
lovely
curtains
i
think
you
can
judge
a
lot
by
curtains
and
their
whole
place
has
a
air
perhaps
they
prove
pleasant
neighbours
their
name
is
fayre
i
saw
the
little
girl
out
on
the
verandah
said
dotty
rose
between
two
bites
of
her
sandwich
she
has
yellow
hair
and
blue
eyes
but
i
do
like
her
why
dotty
how
you
talk
exclaimed
her
aunt
how
can
you
like
her
or
dislike
her
when
you
do
know
her
she
a
prig
i
can
see
that
aunt
clara
i
can
tell
by
the
way
she
walks
and
moves
around
she
has
any
to
her
well
you
go
enough
for
the
whole
neighbourhood
probably
find
she
a
nice
little
girl
all
right
have
it
just
as
you
like
aunt
clara
when
are
you
going
to
fix
my
room
mother
as
soon
as
your
things
come
not
till
most
likely
if
we
can
get
beds
to
sleep
on
that
all
i
ask
i
think
it
fun
and
dotty
danced
around
on
one
toe
i
like
to
live
this
way
always
nothing
in
its
place
and
all
i
believe
you
would
returned
her
mother
laughing
now
if
finished
your
lunch
dearie
run
away
and
play
for
you
only
bother
around
here
dotty
ran
away
but
she
did
play
she
went
from
one
room
to
another
trying
to
learn
the
details
of
her
new
home
but
ever
and
anon
her
glance
would
stray
to
the
house
next
door
and
she
would
wonder
what
the
girl
was
doing
dotty
had
been
allowed
to
choose
her
own
room
from
two
that
her
mother
designated
one
was
on
the
side
of
the
house
that
faced
the
fayres
the
other
was
dotty
hesitated
between
them
she
went
in
one
and
then
the
other
if
i
like
that
thing
she
said
to
her
aunt
clara
i
rather
have
this
room
that
looks
toward
their
house
but
if
i
like
her
and
i
just
about
sure
i
i
rather
have
my
room
on
the
other
side
oh
you
like
her
after
you
know
her
said
aunt
clara
carelessly
but
do
mind
that
take
the
room
you
think
pleasanter
so
dotty
considered
them
both
again
the
room
not
facing
the
fayres
was
without
doubt
the
more
attractive
of
the
two
though
not
much
so
it
had
a
large
bay
window
which
was
delightful
but
then
on
the
other
hand
the
other
room
had
an
open
fireplace
and
dotty
loved
a
wood
fire
she
stood
in
the
room
with
the
fireplace
looking
toward
the
next
house
it
was
saturday
afternoon
and
as
she
watched
she
saw
the
girl
and
two
ladies
come
out
and
get
in
a
motor
car
i
do
like
her
dotty
declared
again
though
as
there
was
no
one
else
present
she
talked
to
herself
she
walks
like
a
prig
she
gets
in
the
car
like
a
prig
and
she
sits
down
on
the
seat
like
a
prig
i
like
her
and
i
going
to
take
the
other
room
so
when
her
own
furniture
arrived
it
was
put
in
the
room
with
the
bay
window
and
which
did
not
overlook
the
fayre
house
the
house
that
she
could
see
from
her
newly
chosen
room
was
so
hemmed
in
by
trees
as
to
be
almost
invisible
dotty
spent
a
pleasant
afternoon
after
her
furniture
was
in
place
arranging
her
little
trinkets
and
pictures
and
putting
away
things
in
her
cupboards
and
bureau
drawers
but
every
little
while
some
errand
seemed
to
call
her
across
the
hall
and
she
could
help
looking
out
to
see
if
that
girl
had
returned
yet
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
rose
was
at
home
well
you
have
a
nice
playmate
in
that
little
girl
next
door
he
said
as
his
daughter
followed
him
round
the
house
looking
after
various
matters
i
wo
daddy
she
horrid
why
why
what
sort
of
talk
is
this
do
you
know
her
no
but
i
seen
her
and
she
is
nice
a
bit
oh
i
guess
she
is
i
came
out
in
the
train
last
night
with
a
man
i
know
and
he
knows
the
fayres
and
he
says
they
about
the
nicest
people
in
berwick
pooh
i
do
think
so
she
a
prim
old
thing
and
does
know
b
from
broomstick
there
there
dotty
doodle
do
be
hasty
in
your
judgment
give
the
little
lady
a
chance
later
dotty
and
her
father
walked
round
the
outdoors
part
of
their
new
domain
is
it
pretty
daddy
exclaimed
dotty
i
so
glad
there
are
a
lot
of
and
nice
big
shrubs
and
lovely
blue
spruce
trees
and
lots
of
things
that
look
like
a
farm
the
roses
had
always
lived
in
the
city
and
to
dotty
eyes
the
two
acres
of
ground
seemed
like
a
large
estate
it
was
attractively
laid
out
and
in
good
cultivation
and
rose
looked
forward
with
pleasure
to
the
restful
life
of
a
suburban
town
after
his
city
habits
there
that
girl
now
and
dotty
suddenly
spied
her
neighbour
walking
with
father
around
lawn
so
it
is
i
shall
speak
to
him
it
only
right
as
we
are
neighbours
and
we
men
need
be
so
formal
as
the
ladies
of
the
houses
i
do
want
to
speak
to
her
and
dotty
drew
back
do
it
daddy
do
nonsense
child
of
course
i
shall
do
be
so
foolish
but
i
do
want
to
she
think
i
crazy
to
meet
her
and
i
not
i
do
want
to
father
what
a
silly
well
if
you
do
want
to
see
the
girl
now
run
away
i
certainly
going
to
chat
with
fayre
and
get
acquainted
now
the
other
pair
of
neighbours
had
not
unnaturally
been
talking
about
the
newcomers
you
see
father
said
dolly
as
she
took
her
usual
sunday
morning
stroll
around
the
place
with
him
that
new
girl
is
nice
at
all
when
i
smiled
at
her
she
scowled
and
shook
her
head
at
me
oh

men

the
houses

and

acquaintance
with
the
little
girl
i
think
she
looks
pretty
dolly
started
then
a
sudden
fit
of
shyness
seized
her
and
she
stood
i
ca
she
murmured
oh
father

me
to
all
right
dear
do
if
you
do
want
to
run
back
to
the
house

to
speak
to
mr
rose
and
that
how
it
happened
that
as
the
two
men
neared
each
other
with
greeting
smiles
the
two
girls
started
simultaneously
and
ran
like
frightened
rabbits
away
from
each
other
and
to
their
respective
homes
chapter
ii
dotty
rose
and
dolly
fayre
a
few
days
passed
without
communication
between
the
two
houses
fayre
expressed
a
decided
approval
of
his
new
neighbour
and
advised
his
wife
to
call
on
rose
fayre
said
she
would
do
so
as
soon
as
the
proper
time
came
i
not
going
said
dolly
i
do
like
that
girl
and
i
never
shall
why
dorinda
said
her
father
who
only
used
her
full
name
when
he
was
serious
i
never
known
you
to
act
so
before
i
thought
you
were
a
nice
little
girl
and
here
you
are
acting
like
a
cantankerous
catamaran
what
is
the
matter
with
you
doll
asked
trudy
you
are
unreasonable
about
the
little
rose
girl
let
her
alone
said
dolly
mother
she
get
over
it
i
never
get
over
it
declared
dolly
i
do
want
to
know
a
girl
as
big
as
i
am
who
plays
with
dolls
how
do
you
know
she
plays
with
dolls
well
a
dolls
carriage
went
in
there
the
day
they
moved
in
perhaps
it
one
she
used
to
have
and
she
has
kept
it
for
old
associations
maybe
anyhow
i
do
like
her
she
made
faces
at
me
really
and
her
mother
smiled
well
she
scowled
at
me
and
shook
her
head
like
a
like
a
like
a
little
girl
shaking
her
head
said
fayre
to
help
her
out
but
dolly
did
smile
she
was
a
queer
nature
was
dolly
usually
sunny
and
she
liked
almost
everything
and
everybody
but
if
she
did
take
a
dislike
it
became
a
prejudice
and
very
hard
to
remove
dolly
was
pretty
with
the
bluest
of
blue
eyes
and
the
pinkest
of
pink
cheeks
and
the
yellowest
of
yellow
hair
she
was
inclined
to
be
plump
and
trudy
was
always
beseeching
her
not
to
eat
so
much
candy
and
sweet
desserts
but
dolly
loved
these
things
and
had
small
concern
about
her
increasing
weight
she
did
care
much
for
outdoor
play
and
would
rather
sit
in
the
hammock
and
read
a
than
run
after
tennis
balls
her
mother
called
her
a
dreamer
and
often
came
upon
her
sitting
in
the
twilight
her
thoughts
far
away
in
a
fairyland
of
her
own
imagination
enjoying
wonderful
adventures
and
thrilling
scenes
dolly
was
in
the
grammar
school
and
next
year
would
be
in
the
high
school
she
did
like
study
particularly
except
history
and
literature
but
she
studied
conscientiously
and
always
knew
her
lessons
this
morning
she
kissed
her
mother
and
started
off
for
school
she
wore
a
blue
and
white
gingham
and
a
coat
swinging
her
bag
of
books
she
marched
past
the
rose
house
and
though
she
did
look
at
her
she
could
see
the
rose
girl
on
the
front
steps
i
wonder
if
she
go
to
our
school
thought
dolly
and
for
a
moment
the
impulse
seized
her
to
stop
and
scrape
acquaintance
then
she
remembered
that
shaking
head
and
fearing
a
rebuff
she
walked
on
by
do
you
know
that
new
girl
next
door
to
you
celia
ferris
asked
her
as
she
entered
the
school
yard
no
do
you
and
dolly
looked
indifferent
no
i
do
but
my
mother
knows
a
lady
who
knows
them
and
she
says
dorothy
that
her
name
is
a
wonder
a
wonder
how
oh
she
so
smart
and
so
clever
and
she
can
do
everything
so
well
this
was
enough
for
dolly
fayre
to
think
that
disagreeable
new
neighbour
of
hers
must
be
a
paragon
of
all
the
virtues
but
dolly
was
never
unjust
she
knew
she
had
no
real
reason
to
dislike
dorothy
rose
so
she
only
said
i
have
met
her
yet
my
mother
is
going
to
call
there
this
week
and
then
i
i
get
acquainted
with
her
how
funny
said
celia
who
was
chummy
by
nature
i
should
think
go
in
and
play
with
her
without
waiting
for
your
mother
to
call
and
all
that
anybody
think
you
were
as
old
as
trudy
oh
i
could
do
that
if
i
wanted
to
but
i
do
want
to
well
i
think
i
go
to
see
her
anyway
if
she
so
smart
it
would
be
nice
to
have
her
in
the
closing
day
exercises
i
she
come
to
school
here
of
course
you
can
do
as
you
like
celia
but
i
think
it
too
late
to
get
any
new
girls
in
now
dolly
went
on
to
the
schoolroom
her
heart
full
of
resentment
at
this
smart
interloper
it
was
a
little
bit
a
feeling
of
jealousy
for
dolly
fayre
was
head
and
front
of
everything
that
went
on
at
the
berwick
grammar
school
and
it
jarred
a
little
to
think
of
having
a
come
in
with
a
lot
of
new
ideas
and
plans
and
mix
everything
all
up
at
the
last
minute
but
do
get
any
mistaken
idea
that
dolly
fayre
was
a
or
girl
on
the
contrary
she
was
generosity
itself
in
all
her
dealings
with
her
schoolmates
every
one
liked
her
and
with
good
reason
for
she
never
quarrelled
and
was
always
happy
and
smiling
but
the
rose
girl
had
acted
queer
from
the
first
and
dolly
admit
the
desirability
of
bringing
her
into
their
already
arranged
closing
exercises
these
were
so
important
as
to
be
almost
sacred
rites
and
as
usual
dolly
was
at
the
head
of
all
the
committees
and
her
word
was
law
she
went
home
from
school
that
afternoon
thinking
about
it
and
her
pretty
face
looked
very
sober
as
she
went
in
the
house
and
put
her
neatly
away
in
their
place
there
some
lemonade
and
cookies
on
the
sideboard
said
her
mother
as
dolly
went
through
the
hall
all
right
mumsie
and
somehow
after
these
refreshments
had
been
absorbed
dolly
felt
better
and
life
seemed
to
have
a
brighter
outlook
she
took
an
unfinished
and
picked
up
her
white
kitten
and
went
out
to
the
side
verandah
her
favourite
spot
of
a
warm
afternoon
you
see
flossy
she
whispered
addressing
the
kitten
i
want
you
with
me
i
buffled
dolly
was
in
the
habit
of
making
up
words
if
she
could
think
of
any
to
suit
her
and
just
at
the
moment
seemed
to
her
to
mean
a
general
state
of
being
ruffled
and
buffeted
and
rebuffed
and
generally
huffy
and
you
well
know
floss
that
when
i
feel
there
nothing
so
comforting
and
soothing
as
a
nice
little
soft
little
cuddly
little
flossy
blinked
her
eyes
and
purred
gently
and
was
just
as
comforting
as
she
could
be
which
is
saying
a
good
deal
there
was
a
big
wide
swing
on
the
side
verandah
one
of
those
cushioned
settee
affairs
that
are
so
cosy
to
snuggle
into
and
read
and
it
was
without
a
glance
at
the
house
next
door
that
dolly
snuggled
herself
in
among
the
red
cushions
and
opened
her
book
while
flossy
cuddled
in
the
hollow
of
her
arm
and
concluding
that
she
would
be
quite
as
comforting
asleep
as
awake
the
kitten
promptly
fell
into
a
doze
meantime
there
were
arrivals
at
the
rose
house
eugenia
the
eleven
year
old
girl
had
been
staying
with
a
cousin
until
the
house
should
be
put
in
order
and
now
she
had
come
to
the
new
home
she
was
a
witch
and
of
exceeding
vivacious
and
volatile
disposition
oo
ee
she
exclaimed
is
it
great
take
me
everywhere
dot
show
me
all
the
rooms
and
all
the
outdoorses
and
everything
i
did
know
it
was
such
a
big
house
which
is
my
room
even
as
she
talked
eugenia
was
flying
upstairs
only
to
turn
right
around
and
fly
down
again
she
danced
from
room
to
room
sometimes
followed
or
preceded
by
dotty
and
sometimes
not
her
own
room
delighted
her
it
faced
the
fayres
house
being
the
one
dorothy
had
rejected
in
favour
of
the
other
where
blot
asked
dotty
did
you
bring
him
oh
yes
he
down
with
thomas
he
crazy
he
barked
all
the
way
here
but
dotty
was
already
flying
down
stairs
to
find
her
beloved
puppy
here
he
is
miss
dorothy
and
the
chauffeur
thomas
gave
the
black
poodle
into
her
arms
oh
you
blessed
oh
you
cunnin
does
him
love
hims
dotty
the
love
was
manifested
by
some
moist
caresses
and
then
blot
was
all
for
a
scamper
dotty
took
him
out
on
the
lawn
and
set
him
down
herself
all
ready
for
a
romp
now
only
a
minute
before
flossy
the
white
kitten
had
waked
from
her
nap
and
seeing
that
dolly
was
absorbed
in
her
inferred
that
kitten
comfort
was
not
at
the
moment
needed
and
decided
to
go
after
a
very
yellow
butterfly
out
on
the
fayre
lawn
stealthily
across
the
grass
flossy
went
butterflywards
on
each
white
paw
was
daintily
lifted
and
softly
set
down
on
the
thick
turf
as
her
progress
continued
from
the
rose
lawn
blot
spied
the
advancing
flossy
he
did
then
know
her
name
but
he
had
liberal
ideas
on
the
subject
of
introductions
and
he
made
a
wild
dash
toward
the
oncoming
kitten
when
floss
saw
the
small
black
whirlwind
hurling
itself
at
her
she
was
either
too
brave
or
too
frightened
to
retreat
so
she
put
her
white
back
up
as
high
as
possible
and
stood
her
ground
she
expressed
her
opinion
of
the
performance
in
a
series
of
sputtering
yowls
that
drew
attention
from
her
book
to
the
impending
battle
she
sprang
out
of
the
swing
and
rushed
toward
flossy
just
as
the
two
belligerents
met
in
the
grassy
arena
dorothy
rose
on
her
side
of
the
lawn
was
shaking
with
laughter
and
this
sight
was
the
last
straw
to
dorinda
fayre
overburdened
soul
do
you
let
your
dog
eat
up
my
cat
she
cried
out
angrily
to
the
girl
opposite
do
you
let
your
cat
eat
up
my
dog
then
was
the
immediate
response
delivered
with
enthusiasm
equalling
dolly
own
cats
do
eat
dogs
neither
do
dogs
eat
cats
well
these
will
eat
each
other
oh
look
we
get
them
apart
the
battle
was
of
the
pitched
variety
whatever
that
may
mean
but
it
is
a
phrase
used
to
describe
the
most
intense
and
desperate
battles
of
history
and
surely
this
was
one
of
them
dolly
fayre
had
no
idea
that
gentle
little
flossy
had
so
much
fight
in
her
small
white
body
and
dotty
rose
never
dreamed
that
blot
was
such
a
under
his
curly
black
coat
really
alarmed
for
their
pets
the
two
girls
went
nearer
to
the
agile
warriors
who
now
looked
like
an
indistinct
film
that
was
going
too
fast
come
here
blot
dotty
cried
in
most
commanding
tones
come
here
flossy
dolly
called
in
coaxing
accents
insubordination
ensued
on
both
sides
we
have
to
grab
them
declared
dotty
rose
dancing
about
the
war
zone
we
ca
wailed
dolly
fayre
wringing
her
hands
as
she
edged
away
from
the
seat
of
battle
well
i
just
guess
we
will
and
dotty
rose
seized
blot
by
the
scruff
of
his
black
neck
and
shook
him
loose
from
the
white
kitten
with
a
little
cry
of
rejoicing
dolly
fayre
picked
up
flossy
and
plumped
herself
down
on
the
grass
to
make
sure
the
kitten
was
intact
dotty
sat
down
too
and
felt
of
blot
small
and
bones
as
neither
animal
gave
any
cry
of
pain
and
as
each
glared
at
its
late
opponent
the
respective
owners
of
the
combatants
drew
sighs
of
relief
and
held
on
tightly
to
their
pets
lest
a
fresh
attack
should
begin
now
it
stands
to
reason
that
after
a
scene
like
that
just
described
the
two
girls
could
get
up
and
walk
off
home
without
a
word
so
they
sat
on
the
grass
and
looked
at
each
other
and
when
the
troubled
blue
eyes
of
dolly
fayre
saw
the
big
brown
eyes
of
dotty
rose
twinkle
and
saw
her
red
lips
smile
she
discovered
that
the
scowl
she
had
objected
to
was
not
permanent
and
she
smiled
back
but
somehow
they
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
the
smile
broke
the
ice
a
little
but
dolly
fayre
was
timid
and
dotty
rose
was
absorbed
in
looking
at
the
other
blue
eyes
and
yellow
hair
but
it
was
dotty
who
spoke
first
well
she
said
how
do
you
like
me
it
was
an
unfortunate
question
for
dolly
fayre
had
a
single
definite
notion
regarding
dotty
rose
except
that
she
did
like
her
however
it
would
hardly
do
to
tell
her
that
so
she
said
slowly
i
do
know
yet
how
do
you
like
me
well
i
think
you
awfully
pretty
to
begin
with
so
do
i
you
put
in
dolly
glad
to
find
a
favourable
report
that
she
could
make
truthfully
are
we
different
went
on
the
other
thoughtfully
you
so
blonde
and
i
so
dark
yes
i
just
hate
my
hair
towhead
bert
calls
me
who
bert
he
my
brother
he
away
at
school
he
seventeen
years
old
dolly
spoke
proudly
as
if
she
had
said
he
captain
of
the
fleet
why
i
got
a
brother
away
at
school
too
have
you
what
his
name
bob
of
course
it
robert
but
we
always
call
him
bob
he
eighteen
what
else
have
you
got
dotty
knew
the
question
referred
to
family
connections
and
answered
a
little
sister
genie
years
old
that
all
yep
aunt
clara
who
lives
with
us
she

but
she

and
you
know
what
funny
words

do
i
well
i
only
do
when
i
ca
think
of
the
real
ones
are
you
going
to
the
grammar
school
mother
says
it
too
late
to
begin
this
year
here
it
is
may
and
it
closes
in
june
so
she
says
for
me
to
wait
till
next
year
this
was
comforting
if
the
girl
did
go
to
school
this
year
she
could
make
any
bother
with
the
closing
exercises
beside
maybe
she
was
not
such
a
dislikable
girl
as
she
had
seemed
at
first
dolly
sat
and
regarded
her
at
last
she
said
then
the
belongs
to
your
little
sister
to
genie
yes
how
did
you
know
she
had

saw
it

and
mine
dorinda
but
i
called

and
we

we
each
have
a
sister
but
mine

a
big
sister

a
little
sister

but
we
have
as
many
differences

rosy

be
friends

dolly
hesitated
she
was
too
honest
to
pretend
to
a
liking
she
quite
feel
she
looked
squarely
at
dotty
rose
and
said
straightforwardly
what
made
you
scowl
at
me
that
first
day
you
came
i
did
and
dotty
rose
opened
her
brown
eyes
in
astonishment
yes
you
did
and
you
shook
your
head
at
me
when
i
smiled
to
you
you
were
sitting
in
a
window
with
your
legs
hanging
out
sitting
where
oh
i
remember
why
i
did
scowl
at
it
was
because
aunt
clara
called
me
to
come
in
out
of
that
window
and
i
want
to
so
i
scowled
i
a
fearful
temper
and
then
she
told
me
again
to
come
in
and
i
shook
my
head
i
was
shaking
it
at
why
i
did
know
you
then
dolly
drew
a
long
breath
then
that
all
right
i
thought
you
scowled
because
i
smiled
at
you
and
it
made
me
mad
all
right
i
be
friends
with
you
i
like
to
i
think
you
real
nice
so
do
i
you
chapter
iii
the
new
rooms
in
the
cushioned
swing
on
the
fayres
verandah
the
two
girls
sat
an
artist
would
have
stopped
to
admire
the
picture
dorinda
her
pink
and
white
face
framed
in
its
golden
halo
of
curlilocks
her
light
blue
frock
neat
and
smooth
was
calmly
and
daintily
nibbling
at
a
piece
of
cake
catching
the
crumbs
carefully
as
they
fell
beside
her
dorothy
was
rapidly
munching
her
cake
as
she
talked
and
letting
the
crumbs
fall
where
they
might
her
black
hair
framed
her
rosy
cheeks
and
her
eyes
snapped
and
sparkled
as
she
gesticulated
with
both
hands
it
was
dorothy
habit
to
emphasise
her
remarks
with
expressive
little
motions
and
her
father
often
said
that
if
her
hands
were
tied
behind
her
she
could
say
a
word
her
pink
lawn
dress
was
rather
tumbled
by
reason
of
her
wriggling
and
jumping
about
but
dorothy
frocks
were
rarely
unrumpled
after
she
had
had
them
on
ten
minutes
we
been
friends
more
than
a
week
now
she
said
as
she
finished
her
cake
in
one
large
bite
and
brushed
a
few
stray
bits
out
of
her
lap
and
i
think
you
just
fine
i
glad
we
came
to
live
in
berwick

like

spread
her
hands
wide
as
if
embracing
all
the
girls
who
had
figured
in
her
previous
existence
do
you
like
me
as
much
as
that
as
she
spoke
she
touched
her
toes
to
the
floor
and
sent
the
swing
up
in
the
air
with
a
mad
jump
oh
gasped
dolly
as
her
cake
flew
out
of
her
hand
how
how
sudden
you
are
never

like
me
as
much
as
i
like

actress
huh

but
i
going
to
learn
dotty
smiled
as
she
realised
that
their
ambitions
were
at
least
equally
promising
would
it
be
fun
if
we
did
both
get
to
be
famous
me
an
actress
and
you
a
singeress
but
i
may
change
my
mind
about
mine
i
do
sometimes
last
winter
i
was
crazy
to
be
a
trained
nurse
but
mother
would
let
me
will
she
let
you
be
an
actress
i
have
asked
her
yet
there
no
hurry
i
could
begin
to
study
for
it
till
i
out
of
school
what
are
you
going
to
get
for
your
birthday
i
have
decided
yet
mother
said
i
could
have
my
bedroom
all
done
over
or
have
a
gold
watch
oh
have
the
room
things
and
i
do
the
same
do
you
know
when
we
moved
into
our
house
i
took
a
room
on
the
other
side
but
i
going
to
move
across
so
i
can
be
on
this
side
toward
you
and
mother
is
going
to
have
the
room
done
up
for
me
and
i
to
choose
the
things
so
you
do
that
too
and
we
have
alike
dotty
had
jumped
out
of
the
swing
in
her
excitement
and
stood
at
one
side
her
foot
on
the
step
pushing
it
sideways
do
do
that
dot
you
break
the
swing
well
will
you
will
you
choose
the
room
fixings
of
the
watch
i
do
know
i
have
to
think
fiddlesticks
do
think
jump
at
it
and
say
yes
i
believe
i
rather
anyway
it
would
be
fun
to
have
our
things
alike
i
ask
mother
but
she
said
you
could
have
your
choice
yes
but
of
course
i
talk
it
over
with
her
and
dotty
we
want
the
same
coloured
things
you
know
why
do
we
why
because
we
so
different
what
colour
do
you
want
oh
i
got
it
all
picked
out
i
going
to
have
rose
and
grey
all
the
rage
rose
pink
you
know
and
french
grey
well
i
do
want
that
i
want
pale
green
and
white
you
do
why
rose
and
grey
is
ever
so
much
more
fashionable
i
do
care
i
know
what
i
want
now
see
here
but
do
come
and
sit
down
do
climb
over
the
back
of
the
swing
dotty
jumped
down
from
the
back
of
the
swing
and
came
around
and
seated
herself
beside
dolly
for
nearly
five
minutes
she
sat
quietly
while
they
discussed
the
colours
but
do
you
see
said
dolly
at
last
it
will
be
nicer
for
us
to
have
our
own
colours
and
have
the
things
alike
we
can
have
just
the
same
shape
furniture
and
everything
only
each
stick
to
our
own
colour
dotty
was
persuaded
and
they
agreed
that
the
two
mothers
could
easily
be
brought
to
see
the
beauty
of
their
plans
and
so
it
was
a
neighbourly
friendliness
already
existed
between
the
households
and
as
the
two
birthdays
fell
so
near
together
it
seemed
fitting
that
the
girls
should
have
their
gifts
alike
so
the
paperhanger
was
visited
and
dolly
chose
a
lovely
paper
of
striped
pattern
but
all
white
to
be
crowned
with
a
border
design
of
hanging
vines
and
leaves
in
shades
of
green
dotty
paper
was
the
same
stripe
in
soft
greys
and
her
border
was
a
design
of
pink
roses
and
rosebuds
dolly
woodwork
was
to
be
painted
white
and
dotty
light
grey
the
two
sets
of
furniture
were
exactly
alike
except
that
one
was
enamelled
grey
and
one
white
each
room
had
a
bay
window
and
the
window
seats
were
cushioned
in
green
or
rose
and
the
numerous
pillows
that
graced
them
were
of
harmonious
colouring
the
parents
of
the
girls
agreed
that
a
fifteenth
birthday
was
a
memorable
occasion
and
one
not
likely
to
occur
again
so
they
made
the
furnishings
of
the
two
rooms
complete
to
the
smallest
detail
each
had
a
large
rug
of
plain
velvet
carpeting
dotty
rose
pink
and
dolly
moss
green
window
curtains
of
rajah
silk
fell
over
dainty
white
ones
and
pretty
of
green
and
pink
respectively
gave
the
rooms
a
soft
glow
at
night
trudy
contributed
wonderful
embroidered
covers
for
and
stands
and
dainty
white
couch
pillows
with
monograms
and
ruffles
dotty
aunt
clara
gave
each
of
the
girls
a
picture
which
they
were
allowed
to
choose
for
themselves
they
took
a
whole
afternoon
for
this
and
at
last
dolly
made
up
her
mind
to
take
sir
galahad
and
dotty
chose
after
long
deliberation
a
stunning
photograph
of
the
winged
victory
these
framed
alike
in
dark
polished
wood
were
hung
in
similar
positions
in
the
two
rooms
altogether
the
rooms
were
delightful
it
was
hard
to
say
which
was
prettier
but
each
best
suited
its
happy
owner
there
was
quite
a
discussion
as
to
when
they
would
take
possession
for
everything
was
in
readiness
by
dolly
birthday
which
was
on
the
tenth
i
tell
you
cried
dotty
with
a
sudden
inspiration
let
average
up
dolly
birthday
is
the
tenth
and
mine
the
twentieth
celebrate
both
on
the
fifteenth
that
half
way
between
and
as
fifteen
anyway
it
makes
it
just
right
this
was
agreed
to
as
a
fine
scheme
and
then
fayre
electrified
the
girls
by
proposing
that
they
have
a
little
party
by
way
of
further
celebration
together
of
course
she
said
smiling
not
in
either
house
but
an
outdoor
party
on
the
lawn
between
oh
mumsie
and
dolly
clasped
her
hands
in
ecstatic
joy
at
the
prospect
oh
mrs
fayre
and
dotty
flung
her
hands
above
her
head
and
danced
up
and
down
the
room
where
these
plans
were
being
talked
over
they
were
in
the
fayre
house
having
just
come
down
from
an
inspection
of
dolly
room
and
these
inspections
were
of
almost
daily
occurrence
and
usually
participated
in
by
several
members
of
both
families
good
idea
said
rose
it
will
let
dotty
get
acquainted
with
the
young
people
here
and
that
what
i
want
but
let
me
make
the
party
fayre
and
you
and
dolly
invite
the
guests
as
we
know
so
few
people
as
yet
no
the
party
must
be
half
and
half
as
to
responsibility
and
expense
if
our
two
d
are
to
be
so
friendly
we
must
share
and
share
alike
in
their
doings
so
it
was
agreed
and
as
there
was
but
a
week
in
which
to
get
ready
plans
were
hurried
through
they
decided
to
ask
thirty
of
the
berwick
young
people
fifteen
girls
and
fifteen
boys
i
wish
bob
could
be
home
sighed
dotty
and
dolly
echoed
the
wish
for
her
own
brother
but
the
boys
of
the
two
families
were
deep
in
school
exams
and
could
not
think
of
coming
home
for
a
party
of
course
the
fayres
decided
on
the
invitation
list
but
everything
else
was
mutually
arranged
it
was
to
be
entirely
a
lawn
party
first
because
that
seemed
pleasanter
and
too
because
then
it
could
take
place
on
the
adjoining
lawns
and
so
be
the
party
of
both
only
if
it
rains
said
dolly
with
an
anxious
face
it
wo
rain
declared
dotty
it
rain
on
our
double
birthday
it
will
be
the
beautifullest
clearest
sunshiniest
day
in
the
world
i
know
it
will
the
girls
decided
to
sleep
in
their
new
rooms
for
the
first
time
the
night
before
the
party
for
said
dolly
shaking
her
head
sagely
the
night
after
the
party
we
be
so
tired
and
thinky
about
it
that
we
ca
enjoy
our
rooms
so
much
all
right
agreed
dotty
i
do
care
i
crazy
to
get
into
mine
the
sooner
the
better
i
say
the
two
girls
had
a
birthday
present
for
each
other
and
though
they
did
know
it
the
two
mothers
had
planned
these
so
they
should
be
alike
but
they
did
know
that
the
mothers
had
these
gifts
in
readiness
and
that
they
would
see
them
when
they
awoke
on
the
birthday
morning
by
common
consent
the
real
birthdays
were
ignored
and
the
fifteenth
of
june
accepted
as
the
right
anniversary
for
both
very
formal
were
the
rites
preparatory
to
the
occupancy
of
the
new
rooms
dotty
had
planned
them
and
after
some
discussion
dolly
had
agreed
you
come
over
and
wish
me
in
my
room
dotty
said
and
then
i
go
over
and
wish
you
in
yours
and
then
i
go
home
again
and
when
we
all
ready
for
bed
we
put
out
our
lights
and
stick
our
heads
out
of
our
windows
and
holler
across
somebody
might
hear
us
objected
dolly
pooh
they
wo
and
what
if
they
did
neighbours
have
got
a
right
to
say
to
each
other
i
guess
but
that
disturbing
the
peace
or
something
like
that
huh
the
peace
must
be
awful
easy
disturbed
well
you
got
to
do
it
anyhow
i
have
got
to
either
not
just
say
so
dotty
was
beginning
to
learn
that
dolly
had
a
will
of
her
own
and
she
said
placatingly
well
what
do
you
want
to
do
then
let
do
something
like
this
when
we
all
ready
to
hop
into
bed
let
turn
our
lights
up
and
down
three
times
in
succession
mean
oh
yes
i
see
now
listen
we
do
it
separately
you
flash
first
and
then
i
will
and
after
three
flashes
we
leave
the
lights
out
and
jump
into
bed
at
the
same
minute
so
it
was
settled
and
the
eventful
occasion
duly
arrived
the
girls
bedtime
hour
was
nine
but
some
time
before
that
they
were
in
their
new
rooms
enjoying
their
beauty
and
freshness
at
quarter
before
nine
dolly
appeared
at
the
rose
house
and
said
solemnly
i
come
over
to
wish
dorothy
come
in
said
rose
trying
not
to
smile
at
the
ceremonial
visit
you
find
her
in
her
room
go
right
up
dolly
went
up
and
found
dotty
waiting
for
her
it
pretty
dolly
exclaimed
seeing
as
if
for
the
first
time
the
beauties
of
the
room
the
bed
was
turned
down
and
a
lovely
new
nightdress
with
a
ribbon
run
through
its
lace
edge
lay
in
readiness
for
the
sleeper
oh
it
returned
dotty
i
can
hardly
wait
to
go
to
bed
go
on
say
your
piece
dolly
stood
a
minute
her
hands
clasped
her
eyes
wandering
about
with
a
thoughtful
far
away
gaze
it
all
gone
she
said
at
last
i
ca
remember
it
only
a
line
sleep
sweetly
in
this
quiet
room
oh
thou
thou
art
nor
let
a
troublous
something
or
other
disturb
thy
peaceful
heart
honest
that
all
i
can
remember
well
that
enough
thank
you
sweet
friend
and
playmate
now
go
i
with
thee
grabbing
dolly
by
the
arm
dotty
flew
downstairs
and
across
the
lawn
to
the
other
house
dolly
running
by
her
side
up
to
dolly
new
room
they
went
lovely
exclaimed
dotty
as
she
saw
almost
the
counterpart
of
her
own
room
even
to
the
new
nightdress
only
dolly
had
a
white
ribbon
you
might
have
had
green
said
dotty
doubtfully
no
i
do
like
coloured
ribbons
in
my
underclothes
they
all
right
for
you
dolly
added
politely
but
i
never
did
like
them
now
i
say
piece
and
dotty
bowed
to
her
audience
of
one
i
have
forgotten
it
but
it
very
short
early
to
bed
and
early
to
rise
makes
a
girl
healthy
and
wealthy
and
wise
thank
you
sweet
friend
and
playmate
now
go
i
with
thee
no
do
say
that
you
with
me
now
i
go
home
and
we
both
get
ready
for
bed
when
you
all
ready
put
out
your
light
and
yes
i
know
dotty
scampered
downstairs
and
over
home
and
fairly
flew
up
to
her
room
in
less
than
twenty
minutes
dotty
was
all
ready
for
bed
she
put
out
her
light
and
throwing
a
over
her
nightdress
she
sat
in
the
window
watching
the
light
in
dolly
room
she
waited
and
waited
but
the
light
behind
the
shade
remained
h
said
dotty
to
herself
yawning
she
is
the
thing
i
could
have
undressed
twice
in
this
time
but
at
last
dolly
light
went
out
and
her
shade
was
slowly
raised
then
according
to
their
plan
dotty
flashed
her
light
on
and
off
again
dolly
light
repeated
this
manoeuvre
then
dotty
did
it
again
and
then
dolly
did
the
third
time
the
flashes
came
and
went
and
then
all
ceremonies
over
the
two
girls
went
to
their
new
pretty
inviting
beds
and
were
very
soon
asleep
chapter
iv
the
birthday
morning
dotty
rose
woke
early
next
morning
and
on
the
instant
sprang
from
her
bed
and
flew
to
the
window
but
she
could
see
nothing
of
dolly
the
white
shades
were
down
and
there
was
no
sign
of
any
one
stirring
dotty
turned
back
and
began
anew
to
look
at
her
pretty
belongings
on
the
she
spied
something
she
had
not
seen
there
the
night
before
it
was
a
lovely
picture
of
dolly
in
a
beautiful
silver
frame
dotty
laughed
outright
for
that
was
exactly
what
she
had
given
dolly
a
silver
frame
with
her
own
picture
in
it
the
two
mothers
had
been
in
the
secret
and
had
seen
to
it
that
the
frames
were
alike
but
neither
of
the
girls
knew
that
her
gift
was
to
be
duplicated
it
was
a
perfect
likeness
showing
dolly
at
her
best
a
dreamy
expression
on
her
sweet
face
and
her
soft
hair
in
little
waves
at
her
temples
and
drawn
back
by
an
enormous
ribbon
bow
it
was
almost
too
early
to
get
dressed
so
dotty
slipped
on
a
and
bedroom
slippers
and
dawdled
about
keeping
a
watch
on
the
fayre
house
in
hopes
dolly
shades
would
fly
up
soon
her
little
sister
eugenia
came
bounding
in
she
too
was
in
a
kimono
and
she
gave
a
jump
and
landed
with
a
spring
in
the
middle
of
dotty
carefully
arranged
couch
pillows
genie
cried
her
sister
get
off
of
there
wo
and
genie
bounced
up
and
down
on
the
springs
of
the
couch
get
off
i
tell
you
wo
i
tell
you
it
trying
for
the
pretty
pillows
with
their
snowy
white
embroidered
covers
were
rumpled
and
tossed
by
genie
mischievous
play
genie
rose
you
go
right
straight
out
of
my
room
you
a
naughty
little
girl
and
you
spoiling
my
birthday
things
dorothy
rose
with
a
pug
nose
chanted
genie
with
the
amiable
intention
of
teasing
her
sister
beyond
endurance
and
she
did
for
dotty
flung
back
genie
genie
you
a
meany
and
then
she
grabbed
her
and
pulled
her
off
the
pillows
and
pushed
her
out
of
the
room
and
locked
the
door
it
a
shame
and
poor
dotty
nearly
cried
to
see
the
havoc
naughty
little
genie
had
wrought
one
pillow
cover
was
torn
and
another
had
a
black
mark
from
the
sole
of
genie
slipper
she
heard
a
tap
at
the
door
and
her
mother
voice
said
let
me
in
dotty
dear
dotty
opened
the
door
and
exclaimed
mother
is
genie
the
bad
little
thing
look
at
my
pretty
pillows
oh
what
a
shame
why
you
two
children
quarrel
so
we
did
quarrel
genie
did
it
on
purpose
but
why
ca
you
be
loving
kind
little
sisters
you
always
teasing
each
other
but
i
did
tease
her
mother
well
you
usually
do
now
dotty
ca
you
make
a
birthday
resolution
to
be
more
patient
with
genie
remember
she
only
a
little
girl
while
you
getting
grown
up
fifteen
is
almost
a
young
lady
and
you
should
be
kind
and
gentle
with
everybody
i
i
ought
and
dorothy
sighed
but
it
hard
to
have
my
birthday
things
upset
are
you
going
to
punish
her
mother
oh
no
she
did
mean
to
be
naughty
she
was
only
mischievous
mend
your
pillow
and
the
soiled
one
can
be
laundered
dotty
anger
was
always
quick
to
come
and
quick
to
go
and
she
smiled
brightly
as
she
said
all
right
i
forgive
her
this
time
but
got
to
stop
that
kind
of
teasing
i
speak
to
her
said
rose
how
do
you
like
picture
lovely
is
it
did
you
and
fayre
know
about
the
frames
yes
and
we
wanted
them
to
be
alike
but
i
had
to
urge
you
to
take
this
instead
of
that
other
pattern
remember
yes
indeed
and
dotty
smiled
to
think
how
determined
she
had
been
in
the
matter
but
had
at
last
yielded
to
her
mother
judgment
oh
there
dolly
she
cried
as
she
saw
the
shade
go
up
in
the
opposite
window
hello
happy
birthday
she
called
out
dolly
returned
the
greeting
and
the
two
girls
waved
their
respective
photographs
at
each
other
and
then
both
began
to
get
dressed
dolly
too
had
a
morning
visit
from
her
sister
trudy
looked
in
on
her
way
down
to
breakfast
happy
birthday
doll
she
said
shall
i
tie
your
she
stepped
into
the
new
room
and
while
tying
the
big
bow
looked
around
admiringly
you
a
lucky
little
kiddy
to
have
such
a
lovely
room
it
prettier
than
mine
i
know
it
is
trudy
and
dolly
looked
regretful
i
change
with
you
if
you
like
i
think
as
you
the
oldest
you
ought
to
have
the
prettiest
room
not
at
all
you
little
goosy
and
trudy
kissed
the
troubled
face
this
is
your
fifteenth
birthday
and
i
glad
you
have
such
a
beautiful
gift
to
remember
it
by
with
their
arms
around
each
other
the
two
girls
went
downstairs
dollykins
cried
her
father
throwing
down
his
paper
why
you
do
look
a
bit
different
from
when
you
were
fourteen
i
thought
you
be
a
foot
taller
at
least
i
do
feel
any
taller
or
any
older
father
and
i
do
act
so
but
mumsie
may
i
stop
wearing
dotty
going
to
are
you
sure
and
fayre
looked
quizzical
for
she
had
discussed
this
weighty
matter
with
rose
no
not
sure
but
dotty
going
to
ask
her
mother
and
she
thinks
she
can
make
her
say
yes
well
let
wait
and
see
what
rose
does
say
and
fayre
took
her
place
at
the
breakfast
table
it
seems
funny
not
to
have
a
lot
of
presents
at
your
place
doll
said
trudy
smiling
that
all
right
and
dolly
returned
the
smile
i
agreed
that
my
room
fixings
were
to
take
the
place
of
all
other
presents
and
then
you
have
the
party
you
know
said
her
father
rose
has
a
delightful
surprise
for
it
and
when
i
come
home
this
afternoon
bring
something
to
add
to
the
gaiety
of
nations
oh
father
what
never
you
mind
you
see
soon
enough
will
you
come
home
early
father
as
early
as
i
can
by
five
surely
after
breakfast
the
two
heroines
of
the
occasion
went
out
to
their
respective
side
verandahs
and
the
usual
morning
programme
was
carried
out
each
frantically
waved
her
hand
to
the
other
calling
come
over
then
each
vigorously
shook
her
head
shouting
no
you
come
over
here
no
you
no
you
then
dolly
coaxingly
aw
come
on
come
on
over
then
dotty
positively
no
sir
it
your
turn
come
on
over
here
with
slight
variations
this
dialogue
was
repeated
every
morning
not
that
either
cared
much
which
went
to
the
other
house
but
it
was
one
of
their
habits
perhaps
dolly
oftenest
gave
in
and
on
this
birthday
morning
the
colloquy
was
short
before
she
ran
across
the
grass
and
the
two
friends
sat
in
the
roses
hammock
swinging
vigorously
as
they
talked
how
you
like
my
present
to
you
asked
dotty
with
twinkling
eyes
lovely
and
dolly
smiled
back
how
you
like
mine
to
you
beautiful
truly
dollyrinda
i
awful
glad
to
have
that
picture
of
you
so
am
i
of
you
did
you
get
any
plate
presents
no
i
did
expect
any
all
the
family
gave
me
things
for
my
room
you
know
bob
sent
me
a
dear
little
clock
how
nice
bert
sent
me
a
pair
of
candlesticks
glass
ones
awfully
pretty
is
it
funny
we
do
know
each
other
brothers
we
will
soon
though
bert
is
coming
home
in
about
two
weeks
yes
so
is
bob
as
soon
as
school
closes
oh
here
come
the
men
to
put
up
the
tent
let
go
and
watch
them
dolly
had
been
allowed
to
stay
at
home
from
school
for
the
day
and
the
two
girls
followed
by
genie
ran
out
on
the
lawn
to
see
what
was
going
on
in
order
to
make
the
party
a
truly
joint
affair
it
had
been
decided
to
set
up
a
tent
on
the
lawn
exactly
midway
between
the
two
houses
for
the
party
supper
it
was
a
large
tent
and
gay
with
red
trimmings
and
flags
inside
tables
were
set
up
and
the
maids
from
both
houses
brought
out
plates
and
glasses
in
abundance
oh
is
it
just
exclaimed
dotty
seizing
dolly
round
the
waist
and
making
her
dance
about
the
lawn
lovely
but
do
rumple
me
so
dotty
this
is
a
clean
frock
oh
what
an
old
fuss
you
are
always
thinking
about
your
clothes
i
am
not
any
such
thing
but
what
the
use
of
spoiling
a
clean
dress
the
minute
you
put
it
on
all
right
i
keep
away
from
you
if
you
so
afraid
i
muss
you
up
proudy
for
some
unknown
reason
this
epithet
was
the
most
scathing
in
the
girls
vocabulary
and
either
was
quick
to
resent
it
i
am
not
a
proudy
and
you
look
nicer
if
you
took
a
little
better
care
of
your
own
clothes
so
there
now
my
clothes
are
all
right
they
as
good
as
yours
i
wish
we
have
a
birthday
together
dotty
flounced
away
and
dolly
walked
home
with
an
exaggerated
dignity
these
little
quarrels
were
very
silly
but
they
often
occurred
between
these
two
who
were
really
good
friends
but
who
sometimes
acted
very
foolishly
dolly
went
in
her
own
house
and
as
she
ran
upstairs
she
sang
so
very
gaily
that
fayre
looked
at
trudy
and
said
another
fuss
yes
and
trudy
sighed
i
do
know
as
dotty
rose
is
a
very
good
friend
for
dolly
they
quarrel
a
lot
oh
well
they
get
over
it
right
away
i
think
it
is
good
for
dolly
to
have
some
one
to
stir
her
up
now
and
then
she
naturally
so
meek
and
mild
well
dotty
rose
stirs
her
up
all
right
and
trudy
laughed
it
was
about
half
an
hour
later
that
genie
rose
appeared
before
fayre
where
dolly
she
demanded
ca
you
speak
a
little
more
politely
genie
and
fayre
smiled
pleasantly
at
the
child
you
ai
my
mother
to
tell
me
what
to
say
no
but
this
is
my
house
and
i
like
to
have
little
girls
act
nicely
here
especially
as
i
know
that
you
have
better
manners
if
you
choose
to
use
them
genie
thought
a
moment
digging
her
toe
into
the
rug
and
at
last
said
fayre
please
may
i
see
dolly
why
what
a
little
lady
yes
indeed
you
will
find
her
in
her
room
go
right
up
genie
dear
the
child
trudged
upstairs
and
entered
dolly
room
what
do
you
want
and
dolly
with
suspiciously
bright
eyes
looked
up
from
the
book
she
was
pretending
to
read
you
not
so
awful
polite
either
and
genie
big
black
eyes
looked
sharply
at
dolly
but
never
mind
i
come
over
to
tell
you
that
cryin
about
you
did
she
tell
you
to
come

but
i
think
you

sillies
to

about
each
other

not

the
child
pulled
at
doily
sleeve
all
right
i
will
and
the
two
went
together
over
to
the
rose
house
dotty
in
her
room
heard
dolly
voice
below

and
came
running
down
her

more
than

judicial
foresight

between
the
two
houses
to
receive
their
guests
dolly
fayre

laid
off
their

the
party
a
set
of
lawn

was
a
new
sport
to
many
of
them
and
all
liked
it
and
took
turns
at
the
bowling
others
wandered
about
the
grounds
or
sat
in
the
swings
and
hammocks
and
at
five
they
were
called
to
supper
little
tables
had
been
placed
on
the
lawn

everything
that
goes
to

a
delightful
party
supper

dotty
found
herself
with
clara
ferris
joe
collins
and
one
of
the
brown
twins
how

tad
brown

tad
asked
dotty
laughing
i
asked
him
returned
clara
it
the
only
way
nobody

mother
said
tad
grinning
she
never
makes
a
mistake
but
the
teachers

his
lessons
and
he

long
run
tod
than
i

but
i
prettier
why
how
can
you
be
cried
dotty
you
exactly
alike
oh
can
see
it
i
tad
honest
round
freckled
face
was
winsome
but
not
handsome
and
the
girls
laughed
at
this
vanity
dolly
was
at
a
table
with
the
other
brown
boy
and
grace
rawlins
and
lollie
henry
dotty
rose
is
pretty

she
said
grace
awfully
pretty
agreed
dolly
and
a
nice
girl
too
i
like
her
lots
some
looker
declared
lollie
henry
gazing
with
admiration
over
at
dotty
who
was
laughing
merrily
she
my
sister
put
in
genie
who
was
a
restless
spirit
and
having
finished
her
supper
was
roaming
around
among
the
tables
talking
to
different
ones
so
she
is
and
dolly
patted
the
glossy
black
curls
looks
like
a
spitfire
though
if
she
should
get
mad
commented
tod
brown
who
was
an
outspoken
boy
oh
i
do
think
so
returned
dolly
and
then
she
remembered
the
few
trifling
quarrels
they
had
already
had
no
she
went
on
dotty
a
spitfire
but
when
she
gets
mad
she
just
flounces
off
and
gets
over
it
just
like
a
girl
said
tod
why
do
you
have
it
out
and
done
with
it
that
what
bert
always
says
and
dolly
laughed
i
guess
girls
and
boys
are
different
about
such
things
i
guess
they
are
said
grace
looking
rueful
maisie
may
and
i
have
been
for
two
weeks
now
oh
how
silly
exclaimed
lollie
henry
i
going
to
get
you
two
girls
together
and
make
you
make
up
yes
let
said
tad
come
on
now
i
finished
my
ice
cream
have
you
dolly
they
all
had
and
they
followed
tad
who
was
ringleader
in
this
game
the
others
had
mostly
risen
from
the
tables
and
tad
told
dolly
to
get
maisie
and
bring
her
over
to
their
group
grace
rawlins
looked
a
little
uncertain
she
honestly
wanted
to
be
friends
with
maisie
but
she
was
not
sure
she
liked
the
way
it
was
being
brought
about
dolly
came
back
arm
in
arm
with
maisie
the
two
boys
stood
in
front
of
grace
until
the
girls
came
up
and
then
tad
whisking
aside
said
with
a
low
bow
miss
maisie
may
i
want
to
make
you
acquainted
with
miss
grace
rawlins
the
nicest
girl
in
berwick
except
the
rest
of
them
maisie
coloured
and
looked
and
tad
went
on
i
see
by
the
papers
that
you
two
girls
do
know
each
other
to
speak
to
so
dolly
fayre
and
us
two
boys
are
a
committee
of
three
to
see
that
you
become
acquainted
immediately
if
not
sooner
you
two
will
therefore
now
greet
each
other
with
a
nice
sweet
kiss
tad
manner
was
so
funny
and
so
like
a
kindly
old
gentleman
that
the
girls
had
to
laugh
but
though
grace
looked
willing
to
obey
the
order
maisie
did
not
do
be
silly
tad
she
said
i
guess
you
do
know
what
grace
said
about
me
or
you
would
ask
me
to
kiss
her
tell
me
said
tad
with
the
air
of
an
impartial
judge
and
i
and
my
wise
colleague
lorillard
henry
will
size
up
the
case
and
pronounce
judgment
why
she
said
i
was
the
meanest
girl
in
berwick
because
i
tell
her
the
answer
to
an
algebra
example
and
i
could
because
miss
haskell
had
made
us
all
promise
not
to
tell
the
answers
to
anybody
she
wanted
everybody
to
do
them
without
help
seems
to
me
you
did
the
right
thing
and
tad
looked
at
grace
i
did
know
that
said
grace
i
was
at
school
the
day
miss
haskell
said
that
then
you
could
be
expected
to
know
said
tad
now
it
just
as
i
said
a
boy
would
fight
it
out
with
another
boy
and
he
might
punch
his
head
but
the
matter
would
be
understood
and
straightened
out
and
not
sulk
for
two
weeks
over
it
i
did
sulk
said
grace
well
you
two
sillies
did
speak
to
each
other
it
about
the
same
thing
will
you
be
good
will
you
kiss
and
make
up
i
will
said
maisie
may
heartily
and
she
flung
her
arms
round
grace
and
gave
her
a
most
friendly
kiss
which
was
as
heartily
returned
bless
you
my
children
said
tad
dramatically
now
do
let
me
hear
of
your
quarrelling
again
are
you
mad
at
anybody
dolly
no
sir
thank
you
but
if
i
am
at
any
time
i
come
to
you
for
a
peacemaker
oh
who
here
cried
lollie
spying
a
strange
figure
walking
across
the
lawn
the
group
joined
the
others
and
found
themselves
invited
to
take
a
seat
in
the
rows
of
chairs
which
were
lined
up
in
front
of
an
table
they
did
so
and
soon
all
present
were
seated
in
breathless
anticipation
of
what
might
happen
the
tea
tables
had
been
whisked
away
and
at
the
door
of
the
tent
the
stranger
stood
a
table
in
front
of
him
he
was
a
magician
and
the
tricks
he
did
held
his
young
auditors
spellbound
turning
back
his
coat
sleeves
to
prove
he
was
concealing
nothing
he
would
take
a
large
sheet
of
white
paper
and
with
a
swift
movement
twirl
it
round
into
a
cornucopia
this
was
of
course
empty
and
shaking
it
about
to
prove
its
emptiness
he
then
held
it
upright
and
invited
dolly
to
look
into
it
but
he
held
it
so
high
that
she
had
to
stand
on
tiptoe
to
peep
in
however
she
caught
a
glimpse
and
it
seemed
to
her
there
were
pink
flowers
in
it
then
the
magician
asked
dotty
to
peep
in
she
peered
over
the
edge
and
just
as
she
exclaimed
why
it
full
of
flowers
he
overturned
it
on
her
head
and
she
was
showered
with
lovely
pink
rosebuds
made
of
tissue
paper
where
did
they
come
from
cried
everybody
as
they
scrambled
to
pick
them
up
the
cone
was
empty
where
did
he
get
them
but
the
magician
only
smiled
and
went
on
with
his
other
tricks
has
any
one
a
gold
watch
he
asked
not
many
of
the
boys
had
gold
watches
but
lollie
henry
exhibited
with
pride
one
that
his
grandfather
had
given
him
on
his
birthday
may
i
borrow
it
said
the
magician
ah
thank
you
and
he
took
it
before
lollie
had
really
consented
now
a
silk
hat
much
obliged
sir
as
fayre
provided
the
hat
now
my
young
friends
we
make
an
omelet
two
eggs
somebody
please
nobody
had
any
eggs
and
the
magician
seemed
nonplussed
what
no
eggs
in
all
this
crowd
incredible
ah
come
here
little
girl
he
caught
genie
who
was
running
about
why
here
is
an
egg
in
the
big
bow
of
your
and
here
is
another
in
the
other
bow
what
a
strange
place
to
carry
eggs
did
mother
send
you
to
the
store
for
them
no
sir
said
genie
looking
in
amazement
at
the
unmistakable
eggs
the
man
had
evidently
found
in
her
ribbon
i
should
think
they
would
have
dropped
out
sooner
i
should
think
so
too
returned
the
magician
lucky
for
me
they
did
or
i
could
not
have
made
the
nice
omelet
i
about
to
concoct
he
set
the
silk
hat
on
the
table
laid
the
watch
and
eggs
beside
it
and
then
called
for
a
cup
of
milk
somehow
or
other
fayre
had
that
all
ready
and
handed
it
to
him
with
a
smile
good
said
the
magician
now
we
to
work
i
suppose
many
of
you
girls
know
how
to
make
an
omelet
so
you
must
look
sharp
and
see
that
i
do
it
right
first
we
break
the
eggs
and
whisk
them
up
he
broke
the
eggs
right
into
the
silk
hat
and
stirred
them
with
a
fork
and
then
poured
in
the
milk
slowly
stirring
all
the
time
something
else
goes
to
an
omelet
he
said
trying
to
think
ah
yes
some
sort
of
an
herb
ah
i
have
it
thyme
well
well
fayre
do
you
raise
thyme
in
your
kitchen
garden
no
what
a
pity
but
luckily
i
have
time
right
here
he
took
up
lollie
watch
ah
just
the
thing
he
threw
the
watch
in
the
hat
and
began
to
beat
it
with
his
heavy
fork
he
looked
anxiously
in
the
hat
wants
to
be
crushed
he
said
get
the
flavour
of
time
unless
it
crushed
ah
here
we
are
and
he
picked
up
a
kitchen
poker
that
had
appeared
from
nowhere
in
particular
with
that
he
beat
and
pounded
and
banged
the
watch
and
then
with
a
big
spoon
he
dipped
up
spoonfuls
of
the
mixture
and
let
it
run
back
into
the
hat
the
children
could
distinctly
see
the
bits
of
brass
or
steel
wheels
and
springs
and
even
fragments
of
the
gold
case
lollie
looked
a
little
sober
but
said
no
word
of
fear
for
his
safety
now
we
cook
it
said
the
magician
and
he
poured
the
omelet
into
a
bright
clean
where
the
fire
he
asked
holding
the
pan
high
aloft
and
looking
all
about
there
is
any
said
fayre
you
did
tell
me
to
provide
a
fire
you
should
have
known
enough
for
that
shouted
the
magician
as
if
in
anger
well
as
we
have
no
fire
of
course
we
ca
make
our
omelet
so
take
back
your
things
from
the
he
poured
a
cup
of
clear
milk
which
he
gave
to
fayre
then
he
took
out
of
the
same
pan
two
eggs
which
he
handed
to
genie
intact
and
unbroken
then
he
hesitated
saying
what
else
did
i
borrow
a
watch
a
gold
watch
cried
a
dozen
voices
oh
yes
to
be
sure
and
the
magician
smiling
passed
the
pan
to
lollie
and
there
on
its
clean
shining
surface
lay
the
gold
watch
absolutely
unharmed
such
a
clapping
of
applause
for
many
of
the
young
audience
had
been
forced
to
believe
that
the
watch
was
utterly
ruined
that
closed
the
entertainment
and
soon
after
that
the
young
guests
went
home
how
do
you
he
did
it
dolly
asked
of
dotty
as
they
sat
in
the
swing
talking
over
the
party
oh
it
easy
enough
returned
dotty
they
do
really
break
up
the
watch
you
know
of
course
i
know
that
but
how
they
do
it
what
becomes
of
the
broken
eggs
and
all
i
do
know
but
i
seen
magic
tricks
before
and
they
always
bring
everything
out
right
somehow

back
and
meet
right
straight
here
all
right
but
i
know
i
ca
go
as
fast
as
you
do
you
skate
like
a
streak
of
lightning
well
i
go
sort
of
slow
for
me
and
you
go
as
swift
as
you
can
and
let
try
to
come
together
right
here
the
two
girls
started
in
opposite
directions
and
turned
their
respective
corners
on
their
way
around
the
block
in
due
time
they
passed
each
other
in
the
street
back
of
their
own
and
dotty
nodded
approval
as
she
saw
they
were
about
half
way
round
they
did
pause
to
exchange
any
words
but
waving
their
hands
went
on
their
way
and
rounded
again
on
summit
avenue
as
they
saw
each
other
approach
they
regulated
their
speed
in
a
careful
attempt
to
meet
exactly
where
they
had
started
dotty
had
to
curb
her
speed
and
go
a
little
more
slowly
or
she
would
be
ahead
of
time
but
dolly
saw
that
it
would
take
a
pretty
strong
spurt
for
her
to
reach
the
goal
so
when
they
were
about
ten
feet
apart
dolly
made
a
special
effort
and
put
all
her
strength
into
a
last
grand
dash
dotty
had
looked
for
this
and
as
she
rolled
rather
slowly
to
the
appointed
place
dolly
came
along
and
with
a
fell
swoop
unable
to
control
her
direction
she
crashed
right
into
dotty
and
the
two
girls
went
down
in
a
heap
the
impact
was
so
sudden
and
unexpected
that
neither
had
a
chance
to
save
herself
in
any
way
and
there
was
a
tangle
of
waving
arms
and
legs
and
as
the
crash
occurred
i
broken
myself
dolly
announced
calmly
though
her
voice
sounded
dazed
and
queer
dotty
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
but
changed
her
mind
and
gave
voice
to
the
wildest
kind
of
a
shriek
she
followed
this
up
with
several
others
of
increasing
force
and
volume
and
looked
at
dolly
wondering
why
she
did
yell
too
but
the
reason
was
that
dolly
had
fainted
and
the
white
face
and
closed
eyes
of
her
friend
made
dotty
scream
louder
than
ever
various
members
of
the
two
families
ran
to
the
scene
as
well
as
several
neighbours
fayre
and
rose
looked
on
somewhat
helplessly
at
the
two
girls
but
aunt
clara
went
at
once
at
the
rescue
she
and
trudy
lifted
dotty
to
her
feet
and
found
she
could
stand
try
to
stop
screaming
dearie
said
aunt
clara
and
tell
me
where
you
hurt
i
do
know
cried
dotty
i
do
know
and
i
do
care
but
dolly
is
dead
my
dolly
my
own
dollyrinda
is
dead
and
it
all
my
fault
i
made
her
go
skating
and
my
arm
hurts
awful
ow
her
arm
is
broken
said
bayliss
gently
lifting
dotty
right
hand
which
caused
more
piercing
shrieks
what
shall
we
do
somebody
call
a
doctor
quick
meanwhile
the
strong
arms
of
a
neighbour
gardener
had
lifted
dolly
and
was
carrying
her
toward
her
own
home
it
her
leg
that
bruk
he
said
holding
her
as
gently
as
possible
it
good
luck
she
fainted
she
come
round
all
right
but
she
bruk
a
bone
the
poor
dear
it
seemed
ages
to
the
anxious
mothers
and
friends
but
it
was
really
only
a
short
time
before
doctors
arrived
and
the
two
little
sufferers
were
put
to
bed
and
their
injuries
attended
to
sure
enough
dolly
leg
was
broken
and
dotty
had
a
fractured
arm
both
houses
were
in
a
tumult
of
confusion
as
surgeons
and
nurses
took
possession
and
bones
were
set
and
splints
and
bandages
applied
dolly
fayre
took
it
quietly
and
seemed
almost
awestricken
when
at
last
she
realised
that
she
was
in
her
bed
to
stay
for
several
weeks
but
it
does
hurt
much
she
said
wonderingly
to
trudy
why
does
it
take
so
long
to
get
well
because
the
bone
has
to
knit
dear
and
that
is
a
slow
process
glad
it
does
hurt
but
it
may
at
times
the
worst
though
is
that
you
will
get
very
tired
lying
still
so
long
but
i
know
what
a
brave
little
girl
you
are
and
we
will
all
do
all
we
can
to
help
and
amuse
you
did
dotty
break
anything
yes
she
broke
her
left
arm
that
is
not
as
bad
as
your
breaking
your
leg
for
she
can
walk
about
sooner
than
you
can
but
hers
is
more
painful
so
there
small
choice
in
the
two
accidents
is
she
yelling
like
fury
inquired
dolly
who
herself
lay
placid
and
though
her
blue
eyes
showed
the
strain
she
had
undergone
yes
she
is
and
trudy
smiled
a
little
you
two
children
are
so
different
i
wish
you
would
yell
a
little
and
not
look
so
patiently
miserable
what
dolly
yelling
about
because
she
hurts
so
partly
that
and
partly
because
she
blaming
herself
for
the
whole
thing
how
ridiculous
she
is
a
bit
more
to
blame
than
i
am
she
proposed
skating
but
it
was
because
i
ran
into
her
that
we
fell
down
i
tried
to
steer
out
but
i
could
do
think
about
who
is
to
blame
that
does
matter
the
only
thing
to
think
about
is
to
get
well
as
quick
as
you
can
but
we
ca
do
anything
to
help
that
along
the
doctors
have
to
do
that
indeed
you
can
help
a
lot
if
you
patient
and
quiet
and
cheerful
you
will
get
well
sooner
than
if
you
fuss
and
fret
and
cry
that
might
cause
fever
and
inflammation
and
all
sorts
of
things
trudy
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
dolly
bed
and
she
smiled
lovingly
down
at
her
little
sister
i
going
to
take
care
of
you
she
went
on
mother
wants
to
have
a
trained
nurse
but
i
think
you
would
like
it
better
to
have
me
for
a
nurse
would
you
i
like
it
better
and
dolly
looked
up
wistfully
but
i
do
want
to
bother
you
too
much
trudy
oh
it
is
any
bother
and
besides
mother
will
do
a
great
deal
of
the
nursing
here
she
comes
now
with
your
luncheon
fayre
came
in
bringing
a
dainty
tray
on
which
was
a
small
bowl
of
broth
and
some
crackers
the
nurse
has
gone
she
announced
and
i
glad
of
it
it
was
necessary
to
have
her
here
while
the
doctors
set
the
broken
bones
and
she
will
come
in
every
morning
as
long
as
may
be
necessary
but
much
nicer
to
be
in
charge
of
this
case
myself
and
have
full
jurisdiction
over
my
patient
oh
ever
so
much
nicer
mother
and
dolly
raised
affectionate
blue
eyes
to
her
mother
face
can
i
sit
up
to
eat
no
honey
you
have
to
learn
to
eat
lying
down
but
mother
will
feed
you
and
we
pretend
you
one
of
those
grand
roman
ladies
who
always
ate
their
meals
reclining
on
a
couch
so
although
not
altogether
a
comfortable
procedure
dolly
took
her
first
lesson
in
swallowing
without
raising
her
head
meantime
somewhat
different
scenes
were
being
enacted
next
door
dotty
more
excitable
nature
had
been
thoroughly
upset
by
the
shock
of
the
accident
the
pain
of
her
injury
and
the
remorse
that
she
felt
at
feeling
herself
responsible
for
the
tragedy
her
screams
were
hysterical
and
the
efforts
of
her
mother
her
aunt
and
the
nurse
to
quiet
her
were
alike
unavailing
i
killed
my
dolly
i
killed
my
dolly
she
would
cry
over
and
over
and
though
they
told
her
that
dolly
fayre
was
resting
quietly
and
suffering
very
little
pain
she
would
not
believe
it
and
insisted
they
were
deceiving
her
you
only
say
that
to
quiet
me
she
cried
i
know
it
is
true
i
know
dolly
has
broken
most
all
her
bones
and
i
know
she
never
walk
again
why
i
saw
her
myself
all
limp
and
if
she
lives
she
be
a
cripple
oh
my
arm
my
arm
i
wish
they
cut
it
off
rather
not
have
it
at
all
than
have
it
hurt
like
this
impulsive
dotty
tried
to
move
her
injured
arm
and
then
shrieked
with
the
pain
it
caused
her
you
must
do
that
said
nurse
johnson
somewhat
severely
if
you
try
to
move
that
arm
it
wo
heal
right
and
you
have
to
have
it
broken
over
again
and
dotty
glared
at
the
nurse
and
then
screamed
i
hate
you
you
go
right
straight
out
of
this
house
my
mother
can
take
care
of
me
good
enough
and
i
do
want
you
around
there
there
dotty
dear
said
rose
do
talk
to
nurse
like
that
she
has
been
very
kind
to
you
and
it
true
if
you
move
your
arm
around
like
that
or
try
to
do
so
you
make
your
injury
far
worse
i
do
care
i
want
to
make
it
worse
i
want
to
have
it
cut
off
i
wo
have
a
broken
arm
i
wo
i
wo
do
mind
her
nurse
she
beside
herself
with
pain
and
fright
oh
that
all
right
rose
and
the
nurse
smiled
i
do
blame
little
girls
for
being
cantankerous
when
they
laid
up
like
this
it
awful
hard
on
them
and
nobody
knows
it
better
than
i
do
and
i
not
going
to
stay
long
miss
dotty
only
a
day
or
two
till
your
mother
and
aunt
get
the
knack
of
taking
care
of
you
i
shall
be
head
nurse
said
bayliss
smiling
at
dotty
and
your
mother
shall
be
my
assistant
i
do
want
you
for
my
nurse
aunt
clara
and
i
do
want
miss
johnson
i
just
want
mother
all
the
time
yes
dotty
dear
mother
will
be
here
all
the
time
and
rose
gently
stroked
the
moist
dark
curls
back
from
the
little
brow
for
a
few
moments
dotty
was
quieter
and
then
she
screamed
out
again
tell
me
about
dolly
tell
me
the
truth
about
dolly
did
she
break
both
her
legs
no
dear
only
one
it
has
been
set
and
she
is
doing
nicely
although
she
will
be
in
bed
for
a
long
time
you
will
probably
get
up
and
go
to
see
her
long
before
she
can
come
in
here
i
want
to
go
now
and
dotty
tried
to
rise
i
want
to
see
dolly
i
must
see
dolly
gently
but
firmly
the
nurse
held
dotty
down
on
the
pillows
lie
still
she
commanded
for
she
saw
that
stern
measures
were
necessary
i
ca
lie
still
when
i
do
know
how
dolly
is
i
do
believe
what
you
tell
me
about
her
but
i
believe
genie
she
always
tells
me
the
truth
come
here
genie
dotty
screamed
her
sister
name
in
a
loud
voice
and
the
little
girl
came
running
into
the
sick
room
genie
looked
scared
and
as
she
saw
dotty
in
splints
and
bandages
genie
said
dotty
and
her
black
eyes
burned
like
coals
you
go
straight
over
to
fayres
and
see
dolly
see
for
yourself
and
see
just
how
she
is
and
come
straight
back
and
tell
me
let
her
go
said
the
nurse
that
a
good
idea
so
genie
ran
over
to
the
next
house
and
found
fayre
please
let
me
see
dolly
she
said
earnestly
if
i
do
dotty
thinks
she
dead
and
then
dotty
will
die
too
so
please
let
me
see
her
fayre
ca
i
after
some
consideration
fayre
said
genie
might
go
to
dolly
room
for
a
few
moments
how
are
you
dolly
said
the
child
marching
in
and
standing
by
the
bedside
with
the
air
of
a
royal
messenger
i
pretty
good
and
dolly
smiled
wanly
at
her
little
visitor
dotty
dotty
awful
but
she
be
better
when
she
knows
how
you
are
so
tell
me
zactly
well
tell
dotty
my
right
leg
is
broken
one
of
the
bones
just
above
the
ankle
but
tell
her
except
for
that
i
all
right
and
for
her
not
to
worry
about
me
and
we
see
who
can
get
well
first
and
give
her
my
love
and
and
oh
that
all
genie
the
little
girl
ran
out
of
the
room
and
as
soon
as
she
disappeared
dolly
burst
into
floods
of
weeping
that
was
her
way
of
relieving
her
overburdened
nerves
instead
of
screaming
hysterically
like
dotty
trudy
tried
to
soothe
her
but
there
was
no
staying
the
torrent
of
tears
until
at
last
they
stopped
because
dolly
was
exhausted
there
said
fayre
brightly
as
she
wiped
dolly
eyes
i
just
glad
you
did
that
there
nothing
like
a
good
cry
to
straighten
things
out
now
i
should
be
one
bit
surprised
if
you
could
take
a
nice
little
nap
and
dolly
did
so
meantime
genie
trotted
home
with
her
comforting
news
for
dotty
dolly
all
right
she
announced
one
leg
is
broked
but
all
only
just
one
bone
of
one
leg
and
she
says
to
see
who
get
well
first
how
did
she
look
asked
dotty
eagerly
like
a
angel
replied
genie
enthusiastically
her
face
was
all
white
and
her
eyes
were
so
blue
and
her
hair
was
all
goldy
and
braided
in
two
curly
braids
tickling
around
her
ears
oh
she
looked
lovely
heaps
better
than
you
do
dot
your
face
is
all
red
and
splotchy
and
your
eyes
are
as
big
as
saucers
and
your
hair
looks
like
the
dickens
i
do
care
said
dotty
crossly
i
do
care
how
i
look
but
i
care
how
you
feel
said
her
mother
and
now
you
know
that
dolly
is
very
much
alive
i
sure
you
let
nurse
bathe
your
face
and
brush
your
hair
and
then
i
going
to
sing
you
to
sleep
as
is
usual
in
case
of
broken
bones
the
first
night
proved
a
very
trying
time
for
all
concerned
dolly
fayre
though
an
unusually
patient
child
felt
as
if
she
could
not
bear
the
pain
and
discomfort
of
her
strapped
and
splinted
leg
her
mother
and
trudy
and
her
father
too
did
all
they
could
to
alleviate
her
sufferings
but
the
uncontrollable
tears
welled
up
in
the
blue
eyes
and
rolled
over
the
fevered
cheeks
of
the
little
sufferer
i
try
to
be
good
father
she
said
as
fayre
bent
over
her
but
it
does
hurt
so
awful
does
it
you
dear
blessed
baby
let
daddy
cuddle
your
head
in
his
arm
so
and
sing
to
you
maybe
that
will
help
but
when
fayre
gently
put
his
arm
under
the
golden
head
on
the
pillow
dolly
cried
out
that
his
coat
sleeve
was
too
scratchy
well
now
we
just
fix
that
give
me
one
of
your
dressing
gowns
mother
dolly
had
to
laugh
a
little
when
fayre
brought
a
silk
kimono
of
her
own
and
managed
to
get
its
loose
folds
draped
around
her
stalwart
husband
i
rather
guess
we
wo
scratch
our
poor
little
fevery
cheeks
and
fayre
so
deftly
slipped
his
silk
clad
arm
under
dolly
head
that
she
rested
in
his
strong
clasp
with
a
feeling
of
security
and
comfort
that
lovely
daddy
it
just
seems
as
if
i
had
some
of
your
big
strong
strength
and
my
pain
does
hurt
so
much
then
fayre
sang
in
soft
low
tones
which
greatly
soothed
the
little
patient
but
not
for
long
all
through
the
night
the
paroxysms
of
agony
would
recur
and
poor
little
dolly
cried
like
a
baby
because
she
could
possibly
help
it
but
the
rose
family
had
even
worse
times
to
take
care
of
dotty
she
too
suffered
intensely
and
even
made
it
worse
because
she
would
stay
still
with
a
sudden
jerk
she
would
sit
up
in
bed
and
then
scream
with
the
pain
occasioned
by
wrenching
her
injured
arm
you
must
do
that
dear
said
rose
who
usually
could
calm
dotty
in
her
most
wilful
moments
i
have
to
cried
the
little
girl
you
would
too
if
your
arm
was
all
on
fire
and
shooting
needles
into
you
and
not
set
right
and
has
to
be
broken
over
again
and
all
twisted
up
and
hanging
by
a
thread
anyway
ow
ow
ow
her
voice
rose
in
a
shrill
screech
and
she
rocked
back
and
forth
in
her
pain
and
anger
now
dotty
dear
said
her
father
you
must
realise
that
you
make
matters
a
great
deal
worse
by
jumping
around
and
moving
your
arm
but
i
ca
help
it
i
going
to
shake
it
till
i
shake
it
off
and
dotty
gave
a
violent
shake
of
her
shoulders
and
then
screamed
with
the
added
pain
she
brought
on
herself
she
so
disarranged
the
bandages
that
it
was
necessary
to
telephone
for
the
doctor
at
once
to
readjust
them
this
wo
do
young
lady
said
milton
as
he
looked
at
the
havoc
she
had
wrought
in
his
careful
work
if
you
keep
up
these
performances
you
have
to
be
strapped
to
the
bed
so
tightly
that
you
ca
move
either
arm
how
would
you
like
that
i
break
loose
somehow
you
sha
strap
me
down
dotty
eyes
blazed
and
her
black
curls
bobbed
as
she
shook
her
head
angrily
at
the
doctor
but
milton
paid
little
heed
to
her
words
he
redressed
her
arm
and
then
said
in
his
firm
yet
pleasant
way
i
do
know
you
very
well
miss
dotty
but
i
perceive
you
have
a
strong
will
of
your
own
now
are
you
going
to
use
it
rightly
to
help
yourself
get
well
or
wrongly
to
make
all
the
trouble
possible
for
yourself
and
every
one
else
dotty
looked
at
him
she
was
not
accustomed
to
this
kind
of
talk
for
her
parents
were
inclined
to
be
over
indulgent
with
her
tantrums
and
her
temper
i
do
want
to
get
well
as
soon
as
i
can
she
said
and
i
will
try
to
be
good
but
you
do
know
how
it
hurts
yes
i
do
know
and
the
good
doctor
smiled
down
at
her
i
know
it
hurts
like
fury
like
the
very
dickens
and
all
and
i
know
it
just
all
you
can
do
to
bear
it
but
if
you
can
get
through
i
promise
you
it
feel
better
he
went
away
and
dotty
did
try
to
be
as
good
as
she
could
but
the
awful
twinges
of
pain
frequently
made
her
forget
her
resolutions
and
to
herself
and
the
whole
household
it
seemed
as
if
the
night
would
never
end
chapter
vii
two
big
brothers
where
are
you
hey
hi
with
half
a
dozen
steps
bob
rose
ran
up
the
staircase
of
his
new
home
in
berwick
to
dotty
room
as
he
had
been
at
school
when
the
family
moved
he
had
never
seen
the
house
before
and
now
the
school
term
over
he
had
come
home
for
vacation
and
his
first
thought
was
for
his
sister
it
was
two
weeks
since
the
accident
but
dotty
was
still
in
bed
her
arm
was
doing
nicely
but
she
was
such
a
nervous
and
excitable
child
that
it
was
thought
best
to
keep
her
as
quiet
as
possible
she
was
sitting
up
in
a
nest
of
pillows
and
a
rose
coloured
kimono
was
draped
round
her
arm
but
she
waved
the
other
hand
gaily
as
bob
dashed
into
the
room
well
old
girl
he
cried
this
is
the
limit
the
idea
of
your
smashing
yourself
like
this
here
i
played
every
old
kind
of
ball
and
everything
else
and
never
broke
one
of
my
two
hundred
and
eight
blessed
bones
and
you
just
go
out
on
roller
skates
and
come
a
cropper
fie
upon
you
does
it
hurt
much
you
bet
it
hurts
bob
nothing
like
it
did
at
first
but
it
hurts
a
good
deal
and
it
awful
uncomfortable
i
ca
move
it
you
know
and
i
ca
do
hardly
anything
for
myself
pooh
pshaw
of
course
you
can
do
things
for
yourself
what
a
chump
you
are
dot
why
it
your
left
arm
you
ought
to
be
able
to
do
everything
in
creation
with
your
right
arm
alone
except
maybe
play
the
piano
or
clap
your
hands
i
show
you
how
to
do
things
is
your
right
arm
all
right
yes
i
so
but
i
have
used
it
any
jiminy
crickets
is
that
just
like
a
girl
honest
dot
i
thought
you
have
more
spunk
but
i
put
you
through
with
bells
on
bob
rose
just
turned
eighteen
was
a
boyish
duplicate
of
dotty
he
had
the
same
snapping
black
eyes
and
his
hair
though
short
had
a
curly
twist
to
it
which
though
he
hated
it
himself
made
a
becoming
frame
for
his
handsome
face
he
was
overflowing
with
mischief
and
life
and
was
devoted
to
athletic
or
outdoor
sports
of
all
kinds
he
was
very
fond
of
his
sister
and
the
two
had
always
been
great
chums
though
frequently
indulging
in
spirited
quarrels
what
this
place
like
anyway
he
inquired
as
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
dotty
bed
and
draped
his
long
arm
over
the
footboard
you
got
a
jolly
room
all
right
and
he
looked
round
admiringly
at
the
pretty
rose
and
grey
effects
yes
is
it
lovely
it
was
my
birthday
present
the
furnishings
i
mean
i
wrote
you
about
it
you
know
we
were
going
to
fix
up
a
lovely
room
for
you
too
but
after
i
broke
my
arm
mother
and
aunt
clara
did
have
time
to
do
anything
but
tend
to
me
well
they
catch
time
now
i
want
a
room
fixed
up
for
me
as
good
as
yours
but
not
so
i
pick
out
the
things
myself
you
need
think
you
own
the
whole
miss
i
just
guess
brother
bob
home
on
his
vacation
will
come
in
for
his
share
of
attention
you
wo
be
neglected
i
look
out
for
that
but
just
remember
that
i
here
too
what
the
town
like
i
do
know
myself
much
you
see
we
had
our
party
and
i
met
a
lot
of
the
boys
and
girls
and
then
the
very
next
day
i
smashed
myself
and
of
course
i
have
seen
any
of
them
since
but
you
can
pretty
soon
now
why
it
only
your
arm
your
legs
are
all
right
you
can
walk
ca
you
why
do
you
go
downstairs
and
have
people
come
to
see
you
i
could
see
people
in
a
well
mother
can
rig
you
up
a
basque
or
a
polonaise
or
something
or
put
on
a
raincoat
or
an
indian
blanket
but
for
goodness
sake
get
out
and
around
i
stir
you
up
here
here
what
going
on
and
rose
came
in
just
in
time
to
hear
bob
last
words
you
not
to
stir
dotty
up
bob
we
want
to
keep
her
quiet
quiet
nothing
she
dry
up
and
blow
away
if
she
does
get
a
move
on
you
going
to
rig
her
up
some
sort
of
civilian
dress
mother
and
get
her
downstairs
this
very
day
she
not
sick
or
going
into
a
decline
is
she
the
influence
of
bob
breezy
chatter
had
wrought
a
change
in
dotty
during
the
two
weeks
that
had
just
passed
she
had
become
peevish
and
fretful
from
enforced
inactivity
and
now
the
thought
of
getting
up
and
going
downstairs
had
brought
the
smiles
to
her
face
and
the
light
to
her
eyes
moreover
rose
was
impressed
also
by
the
determination
of
her
big
young
son
and
began
to
think
that
perhaps
his
way
might
be
right
after
all
now
you
got
to
tend
to
me
mumsie
bob
said
in
his
wheedlesome
way
as
he
caressed
his
mother
in
a
big
bearish
fashion
you
got
to
fix
up
a
room
for
me
all
just
as
i
want
it
and
you
got
to
make
me
chocolate
cakes
and
all
sorts
of
good
things
to
eat
and
you
got
to
do
lots
of
things
for
your
prodigal
son
dotty
has
had
her
turn
and
now
it
mine
but
while
you
busy
about
me
i
look
after
dot
bless
her
old
heart
and
bob
blew
a
kiss
from
his
finger
tips
to
his
pretty
sister
who
had
already
begun
to
take
a
new
interest
in
life
hello
aunt
clara
bob
called
out
as
bayliss
passed
through
the
hall
come
in
here
and
help
us
dressmakers
ca
you
rig
up
a
costume
for
dot
that
will
be
presentable
to
wear
downstairs
downstairs
exclaimed
aunt
clara
did
the
doctor
say
she
could
go
down
bob
said
so
and
the
boy
laughed
i
know
all
about
broken
arms
and
there
no
use
giving
in
to
them
too
much
the
more
you
do
for
them
the
more
you
may
now
dotty
is
going
to
forget
hers
and
have
just
as
good
a
time
as
if
she
never
broke
it
i
say
dot
how
that
chum
of
yours
you
wrote
me
about
is
this
her
picture
wow
ai
she
the
peach
bob
picked
up
the
picture
of
dolly
from
dotty
and
admired
it
openly
does
she
really
look
like
that
yes
and
dotty
waxed
enthusiastic
she
beautiful
just
like
a
pinky
rose
with
blue
eyes
she
broke
her
leg
did
she
in
your
scrap
yes
she
ca
move
for
six
weeks
well
two
weeks
are
gone
now
that
something
ca
i
see
her
like
to
sympathise
oh
yes
bob
of
course
you
must
see
her
but
i
do
want
you
to
go
over
there
till
i
can
go
with
you
oh
i
not
going
to
wait
for
that
i
must
have
a
peep
at
this
fairy
for
myself
any
go
to
her
not
much
and
dotty
smiled
dolly
a
perfect
dear
but
she
slow
all
right
we
have
to
hurry
her
along
a
little
when
does
her
brother
come
home
have
you
ever
seen
him
what
he
like
he
coming
day
after
no
i
never
seen
him
but
dolly
thinks
he
just
about
made
the
world
well
i
reserve
my
opinion
till
i
see
the
bunch
honest
old
girl
i
glad
you
getting
along
as
well
as
you
are
but
i
going
to
do
wonders
for
you
it
going
to
be
lucky
for
you
that
you
got
brother
on
the
job
why
dot
we
were
all
going
camping
this
summer
you
know
what
about
that
we
have
planned
for
the
summer
yet
bobs
said
his
mother
perhaps
by
august
if
dotty
is
all
right
we
can
go
somewhere
for
awhile
you
bet
we
will
returned
bob
dotty
will
be
all
right
the
next
day
but
one
rose
took
her
big
boy
over
to
call
on
dolly
fayre
though
unable
to
leave
her
bed
dolly
could
sit
up
and
was
allowed
to
see
a
few
visitors
each
day
it
was
her
nature
to
be
quiet
so
she
was
a
much
more
tractable
patient
than
dotty
and
her
broken
bone
had
already
begun
to
knit
and
was
getting
along
nicely
it
was
very
monotonous
to
sit
or
lie
there
day
after
day
but
dolly
was
patient
and
always
took
things
placidly
her
parents
and
trudy
read
to
her
and
played
games
with
her
and
entertained
her
in
various
ways
and
dolly
was
as
cheerful
as
any
little
girl
could
be
in
such
circumstances
it
was
a
bitter
disappointment
to
her
that
she
could
not
take
part
in
the
closing
exercises
of
her
class
but
she
was
reconciled
to
her
fate
and
made
no
complaints
though
deeply
regretting
her
enforced
absence
from
school
her
classmates
came
to
see
her
occasionally
but
they
were
so
busy
preparing
for
the
celebration
that
they
had
little
time
for
social
calls
dotty
looked
forward
eagerly
to
the
homecoming
of
her
brother
bert
and
she
also
awaited
with
some
curiosity
the
meeting
with
bob
rose
however
she
had
heard
so
much
about
bob
from
dotty
that
she
was
not
surprised
when
the
boy
appeared
at
her
bedside
with
a
gay
and
cheery
greeting
i
bob
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
and
not
waiting
for
his
mother
more
formal
introduction
i
dolly
and
the
blue
eyes
smiled
at
him
as
a
little
white
hand
clasped
his
own
by
jove
you
do
look
like
your
picture
only
you
prettier
exclaimed
bob
as
he
took
the
chair
fayre
offered
him
it
my
new
cap
and
dolly
smiled
from
beneath
the
lacy
frills
and
rosebud
decorations
of
a
dainty
new
cap
that
trudy
had
just
made
for
her
she
wore
a
japanese
kimono
of
pale
green
silk
embroidered
with
white
cherry
blossoms
and
as
she
sat
surrounded
by
embroidered
pillows
and
lace
coverlets
bob
thought
he
had
never
seen
a
prettier
picture
you
look
like
a
princess
he
said
princess
dolly
i
a
princess
she
smiled
back
mother
and
trudy
are
my
ladies
in
waiting
and
do
just
as
i
bid
them
how
much
you
look
like
dotty
glad
you
think
so
i
think
dot
a
raving
beauty
but
i
say
it
a
shame
you
two
girls
had
to
go
and
break
each
other
up
just
when
we
were
going
to
have
a
perfectly
good
old
summer
time
i
know
it
is
it
a
shame
but
we
have
to
wait
till
next
summer
and
have
the
fun
then
we
wo
you
be
outdoors
by
the
first
of
august
wo
you
yes
and
dolly
made
a
wry
face
but
that
about
the
same
as
saying
the
first
of
eternity
oh
not
so
bad
as
that
and
anyhow
i
an
inventive
genius
and
bet
we
can
have
some
fun
even
before
august
a
bustle
and
commotion
was
heard
downstairs
just
then
and
dolly
face
lighted
up
as
she
heard
a
familiar
voice
oh
she
cried
there
bert
come
on
up
bert
sure
thing
came
the
reply
and
in
another
minute
bert
fayre
stood
in
the
doorway
he
was
a
tall
slender
boy
of
seventeen
with
brown
hair
and
eyes
and
he
looked
at
dolly
with
a
pained
expression
poor
old
doll
he
said
softly
i
sorry
for
you
oh
it
is
very
bad
now
bert
and
dolly
smiled
cheerfully
come
on
in
and
meet
rose
and
bob
they
our
next
door
neighbours
bert
came
in
and
greeted
the
visitors
with
an
easy
grace
then
going
over
to
dolly
he
kissed
her
affectionately
and
sat
down
beside
her
the
two
boys
silently
sized
each
other
up
and
each
concluded
that
the
other
seemed
to
be
a
little
bit
of
all
right
they
attended
different
schools
and
soon
were
deep
in
a
discussion
of
their
school
doings
dolly
lay
back
among
her
pillows
and
looked
at
them
she
adored
her
brother
and
she
decided
that
dotty
brother
was
also
worthy
of
consideration
she
liked
bob
breezy
offhand
way
which
was
not
at
all
like
bert
gentle
kindly
manner
but
they
were
two
awfully
nice
boys
and
she
felt
sure
they
were
going
to
be
friends
if
only
she
could
be
up
and
around
and
have
good
times
with
them
a
slight
pang
of
envy
swept
over
her
as
she
heard
bob
enthusiastically
declare
that
he
was
going
to
have
dot
out
of
bed
and
downstairs
in
short
order
for
no
amount
of
enthusiasm
or
energy
could
work
that
miracle
for
dolly
in
less
than
a
month
but
she
did
not
show
this
disappointment
and
chatted
gaily
with
the
boys
and
with
rose
and
her
own
mother
as
the
days
went
by
the
four
young
people
became
good
friends
the
boys
were
chummy
from
the
first
and
nearly
every
day
they
carried
messages
back
and
forth
for
the
girls
but
there
were
long
hours
when
the
girls
were
alone
and
both
patient
dolly
and
impatient
dotty
deeply
wished
they
had
never
tried
that
race
there
no
use
celebrating
the
fourth
of
july
said
bert
disconsolately
a
few
days
before
the
fourth
we
do
want
a
celebration
that
the
girls
ca
see
then
let
have
one
that
they
can
see
said
bob
i
tell
you
what
we
do
i
a
brilliant
idea
his
idea
was
a
brilliant
one
so
much
so
that
it
required
the
of
both
families
with
the
exception
of
the
two
girls
from
whom
it
was
kept
a
secret
but
the
two
d
were
told
that
the
evening
of
the
fourth
would
be
a
red
letter
day
for
them
and
they
looked
forward
eagerly
to
whatever
it
might
be
about
seven
on
fourth
of
july
evening
fayre
came
into
dolly
room
with
her
arms
full
of
red
white
and
blue
material
this
proved
to
be
a
voluminous
drapery
which
transformed
dolly
into
a
goddess
of
liberty
a
liberty
cap
was
put
upon
her
golden
head
and
a
silk
flag
was
presented
to
her
stunning
exclaimed
bert
who
came
in
to
view
the
effect
just
you
wait
old
girl
and
we
bring
you
something
you
like
better
yet
so
dolly
waited
and
in
a
few
moments
she
could
hear
out
in
the
hall
much
giggling
and
many
footsteps
then
trudy
came
in
and
arranged
a
screen
so
that
the
doorway
from
the
hall
was
hidden
dolly
watched
breathlessly
and
soon
heard
people
coming
in
behind
the
screen
and
recognised
the
boys
voices
as
well
as
those
of
her
father
and
rose
i
know
you
there
bob
and
bert
she
called
out
come
here
bob
and
see
the
goddess
of
liberty
wait
a
minute
said
bert
and
there
was
more
giggling
and
whispering
now
said
somebody
and
then
the
screen
was
whisked
away
and
dolly
saw
standing
before
her
dotty
it
really
was
dotty
smiling
with
eagerness
and
dressed
like
dolly
in
red
white
and
blue
oh
dotty
and
oh
dolly
rang
out
at
the
same
moment
and
the
two
girls
stared
hard
at
each
other
for
they
had
not
seen
one
faces
since
that
fatal
moment
when
they
came
together
on
their
roller
skates
i
just
crazy
to
run
over
there
and
grab
you
cried
dotty
but
i
promised
i
would
touch
you
or
i
might
break
us
up
all
over
again
well
do
come
over
here
and
sit
beside
me
so
i
can
be
sure
it
really
you
how
is
your
arm
does
it
hurt
you
now
oh
what
a
beautiful
sling
dotty
left
arm
was
in
a
large
sling
made
of
dark
blue
studded
with
silver
stars
and
her
whole
dress
was
of
red
and
white
stripe
her
liberty
cap
was
just
like
dolly
own
and
she
wore
white
stockings
and
red
slippers
you
poor
dear
she
said
as
she
came
over
and
sat
down
by
dolly
side
to
think
i
can
dress
and
go
outdoors
while
you
still
tied
to
your
bed
but
i
can
wave
both
arms
about
and
you
ca
said
dolly
as
she
waved
her
flag
above
her
head
i
think
you
six
of
one
and
half
a
dozen
of
the
other
said
bert
now
look
here
doll
we
going
to
push
your
bed
up
to
the
window
so
you
can
see
out
why
asked
dolly
it
almost
dark
now
never
you
mind
little
girls
should
ask
questions
grab
that
other
bob
here
dad
take
hold
of
the
propelled
by
willing
arms
the
bed
was
rolled
over
to
the
big
bay
window
and
arranged
so
that
dolly
had
full
view
of
the
lawn
between
the
houses
then
a
big
easy
chair
was
arranged
for
dotty
and
the
two
girls
were
advised
that
if
they
would
stay
there
they
would
see
something
worth
while
oh
it
so
good
to
see
you
again
said
dotty
as
the
others
all
left
the
room
do
you
hurt
terribly
not
so
much
now
but
it
was
awful
at
first
was
yours
oh
terrible
let
not
talk
about
it
how
do
you
like
bob
he
splendid
how
do
you
like
bert
i
think
he
great
oh
dolly
what
fun
we
could
have
if
we
were
only
well
you
are
you
can
go
outdoors
not
much
this
is
a
special
dispensation
and
i
have
to
have
my
arm
in
a
sling
four
weeks
longer
it
in
splints
you
know
i
do
hardly
anything
with
one
hand
bob
tries
to
teach
me
but
i
as
awkward
as
a
cow
i
so
used
to
flying
at
everything
with
both
hands
that
i
ca
seem
to
manage
it
must
be
awful
oh
dot
there
a
sky
rocket
dotty
turned
quickly
and
looked
out
of
the
window
the
skyrocket
was
only
the
beginning
of
a
fine
display
of
fireworks
rose
and
fayre
had
concluded
that
was
the
only
sort
of
celebration
the
girls
could
enjoy
so
they
had
bought
far
more
than
their
usual
supply
and
they
made
a
fine
showing
bob
had
asked
a
number
of
the
young
people
to
come
and
see
them
and
dolly
and
dotty
recognised
many
from
their
post
of
observation
in
the
window
but
the
mothers
of
the
two
girls
would
not
let
any
of
the
young
people
go
up
to
dotty
room
lest
the
excitement
be
too
much
for
her
after
the
usual
quota
of
rockets
and
roman
candles
there
were
more
elaborate
pieces
which
flamed
into
fire
pictures
against
the
summer
sky
when
the
fireworks
were
all
over
and
the
young
people
gone
away
the
girls
were
told
that
there
was
a
little
more
celebration
yet
to
come
dolly
bed
was
pushed
back
to
its
place
and
dotty
was
enthroned
beside
it
in
her
easy
chair
when
the
two
boys
appeared
each
bearing
a
tray
of
good
things
this
is
your
fourth
of
july
party
said
trudy
who
followed
no
one
can
come
to
it
except
the
three
roses
and
the
three
fayres
genie
came
in
then
and
the
six
brothers
and
sisters
of
the
two
families
had
a
merry
feast
while
their
elders
remained
downstairs
it
been
a
beautiful
holiday
said
dolly
leaning
back
into
her
pillows
as
she
finished
her
ice
cream
i
never
dreamed
i
have
any
fourth
of
july
celebration
the
fireworks
were
beautiful
and
the
party
things
were
lovely
but
best
of
all
is
seeing
dotty
again
yes
said
dotty
i
do
know
how
i
managed
to
live
through
the
last
three
weeks
but
i
expect
i
can
come
over
to
see
you
every
day
now
we
see
about
that
said
rose
coming
in
but
this
party
must
break
up
now
and
if
it
does
do
any
harm
to
our
wounded
soldiers
we
may
allow
more
of
them
so
say
you
two
d
and
i
take
little
goddess
of
liberty
home
chapter
viii
crosstrees
camp
the
summer
plans
of
the
two
families
were
decidedly
changed
by
the
accidents
to
the
two
little
girls
it
was
the
custom
of
the
fayres
to
spend
the
summer
at
a
hotel
in
the
mountains
or
at
the
seashore
for
fayre
declared
she
needed
a
yearly
rest
from
housekeeping
duties
the
rose
family
preferring
a
different
sort
of
enjoyment
spent
their
summers
at
their
camp
in
the
adirondacks
for
they
loved
the
informal
out
of
door
life
and
the
freedom
from
all
conventionalities
the
doctor
had
said
that
the
two
girls
would
be
entirely
restored
to
health
and
strength
and
quite
ready
to
go
anywhere
by
the
first
of
august
but
not
much
before
that
date
so
during
july
the
question
was
discussed
frequently
and
at
length
as
to
where
dotty
and
dolly
would
go
for
they
begged
and
besought
their
parents
that
they
might
be
together
now
rose
was
more
than
willing
to
take
dolly
to
camp
with
her
family
and
fayre
would
have
been
very
glad
to
have
dotty
with
them
at
the
hotel
but
neither
mother
wanted
her
own
little
girl
to
go
away
from
her
the
question
seemed
very
difficult
of
decision
for
the
two
families
could
not
agree
upon
a
summer
resort
that
would
please
them
both
but
after
many
long
talks
and
various
suggested
plans
it
was
finally
decided
that
dolly
fayre
should
go
with
the
roses
for
the
first
two
weeks
of
august
and
that
dotty
rose
should
spend
the
last
two
weeks
of
the
month
with
the
fayre
family
it
is
the
best
plan
said
rose
for
a
fortnight
in
camp
will
do
the
girls
lots
of
good
and
make
them
strong
and
rosy
again
then
they
will
better
enjoy
a
fortnight
at
a
big
hotel
the
two
d
were
enchanted
at
the
prospect
you
just
love
it
said
dotty
enthusiastically
we
just
wear
short
skirts
and
middy
blouses
and
spend
all
our
time
in
the
woods
or
on
the
lake
dolly
wanted
to
go
to
the
camp
but
she
had
never
before
been
away
from
her
mother
for
more
than
a
day
or
two
at
a
time
and
she
felt
some
misgivings
about
being
homesick
nonsense
said
bert
a
great
big
girl
like
you
homesick
why
towhead
you
too
big
for
such
things
you
have
a
gorgeous
time
in
the
camp
there
more
fun
in
a
camp
than
in
any
other
place
on
earth
i
wish
they
had
asked
me
of
course
they
would
ask
you
said
dolly
because
bob
rose
be
there
not
at
first
anyway
he
going
to
visit
some
school
friend
he
going
to
the
camp
later
but
bob
what
a
camp
like
do
you
have
to
sleep
on
old
dry
twigs
and
things
i
want
to
be
with
dotty
but
i
do
believe
i
like
sleeping
in
a
tent
or
whatever
they
have
ah
be
a
sport
towhead
you
altogether
too
finicky
about
your
foolish
comforts
learn
to
rough
it
it
be
good
for
you
you
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
you
ought
to
be
all
brown
and
red
and
freckled
and
look
like
a
real
live
girl
instead
of
a
wax
doll
i
going
to
coax
dad
to
go
camping
next
year
it
loads
of
fun
maybe
if
bob
rose
gets
up
there
before
you
leave
they
ask
me
up
for
a
couple
of
days
or
they
might
ask
you
after
i
left
said
dolly
you
boys
could
have
a
lot
of
fun
even
if
we
girls
were
there
you
bet
we
could
girls
are
not
a
necessity
to
a
fellow
pleasure
if
he
has
fishing
and
boating
and
swimming
and
such
things
to
do
well
i
ca
swim
and
i
hate
to
fish
but
i
do
like
boating
what
kind
of
boats
will
they
have
bob
oh
motor
boats
and
canoes
and
rowboats
and
sail
boats
and
every
old
kind
do
get
drowned
dolly
and
do
break
any
more
of
your
bones
but
i
guess
there
nothing
much
else
that
can
happen
to
you
if
you
behave
yourself
but
do
try
to
do
everything
dotty
suggests
she
a
hummer
that
girl
and
i
bet
you
in
camp
she
run
wild
you
have
to
hold
her
back
a
little
dolly
parents
gave
her
practically
the
same
advice
but
they
felt
little
fear
of
dolly
likelihood
of
rushing
into
madcap
adventures
even
if
dotty
urged
it
for
dolly
was
slow
of
movement
and
slower
still
in
making
up
her
mind
while
dotty
was
quick
as
a
flash
in
thought
and
action
fayre
sighed
a
little
as
she
selected
dolly
wardrobe
she
dearly
loved
to
array
her
pretty
daughter
in
muslins
and
organdies
with
dainty
laces
and
ribbons
but
camp
life
called
for
stout
frocks
of
tweed
or
gingham
heavy
walking
boots
and
no
fripperies
i
shall
put
in
one
or
two
pretty
dresses
fayre
said
in
case
you
are
invited
to
a
party
or
any
such
affair
and
the
rest
of
your
summer
things
i
will
have
ready
for
you
when
you
come
back
and
join
us
at
the
seashore
and
so
the
first
of
august
and
rose
and
their
two
daughters
with
dolly
as
the
guest
started
for
the
crosstrees
camp
it
was
a
sad
parting
between
dolly
and
her
mother
and
at
the
last
dolly
declared
flatly
she
would
not
go
and
throwing
herself
in
her
arms
burst
into
tears
rubbish
cried
rob
who
was
dancing
about
in
his
efforts
to
get
dolly
started
i
ashamed
of
you
towhead
brace
up
now
and
have
a
nerve
one
final
wrench
and
off
you
go
the
boy
literally
tore
dolly
from
fayre
arms
and
boosted
her
in
to
the
roses
motor
car
which
was
waiting
to
take
them
to
the
station
all
aboard
go
ahead
bob
called
out
waving
his
hand
to
the
chauffeur
and
the
car
started
off
at
a
brisk
rate
you
know
you
need
go
dolly
even
yet
if
you
do
want
to
and
rose
smiled
kindly
at
the
little
girl
as
they
flew
down
the
avenue
i
do
want
to
go
rose
and
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
for
acting
so
bad
but
i
will
brace
up
now
it
was
just
saying
to
mother
that
somehow
sort
of
seemed
to
shake
my
heart
dolly
smiled
through
her
tears
and
determinedly
began
to
chatter
gaily
that
the
ticket
said
rose
smiling
approval
at
her
the
brave
little
girl
now
when
you
get
to
crosstrees
you
be
so
delighted
and
interested
that
you
wo
think
of
home
and
mother
for
two
weeks
except
to
write
a
postcard
now
and
then
you
wo
hardly
have
time
for
that
cried
dotty
there
so
much
to
do
from
morning
till
night
and
that
makes
you
so
tired
that
you
sleep
from
night
till
morning
oh
dollyrinda
we
will
have
the
most
gorgeousest
times
ever
it
beautiful
to
have
dolly
with
us
said
genie
her
big
black
eyes
dancing
with
anticipation
we
can
show
her
all
our
places
and
all
the
islands
and
woodses
and
everything
but
two
weeks
is
an
awful
short
time
we
make
it
longer
next
year
said
rose
if
our
two
wounded
soldiers
had
been
wounded
we
would
have
started
a
month
ago
why
do
you
call
it
crosstrees
camp
asked
dolly
you
see
when
you
get
there
and
rose
smiled
at
his
little
visitor
sure
enough
when
they
arrived
dolly
discovered
the
meaning
of
the
strange
name
the
gateway
was
formed
by
two
trees
which
had
started
to
grow
parallel
but
in
some
way
had
been
bent
toward
one
another
until
their
trunks
crossed
about
ten
feet
above
ground
the
trees
had
gone
on
growing
this
way
and
formed
an
n
covered
with
branches
and
foliage
the
party
had
landed
from
their
train
at
a
small
station
near
one
end
of
a
long
lake
they
had
traversed
this
lake
in
a
swift
motor
boat
for
their
camp
was
at
the
other
end
it
was
nearly
dark
when
they
reached
their
own
pier
and
all
clambered
out
and
climbed
a
flight
of
narrow
wet
steps
hang
on
to
the
railing
doll
said
dotty
the
steps
are
slippery
a
little
passing
under
the
crosstrees
to
which
rose
drew
dolly
attention
as
the
name
of
the
camp
they
came
to
a
sort
of
bungalow
or
long
low
house
is
this
the
camp
said
dolly
in
surprise
i
thought
it
was
tents
you
said
so
dot
there
are
tents
too
only
on
stormy
nights
we
sleep
inside
come
on
in
doll
is
it
fine
dolly
fayre
looked
around
at
the
bare
boarded
rooms
the
scant
furniture
and
rough
walls
of
the
cabin
for
it
was
little
more
than
that
she
was
cold
and
rather
hungry
but
underneath
these
discomforts
was
a
far
more
troublesome
one
which
she
tried
not
to
think
about
but
which
she
felt
sure
was
going
to
develop
into
an
acute
case
of
homesickness
run
up
to
your
rooms
girlies
and
take
off
your
things
said
rose
cheerily
we
eat
inside
and
maria
will
make
us
some
of
her
good
for
supper
maria
was
an
old
coloured
servant
and
the
only
one
who
accompanied
the
rose
family
to
camp
other
help
that
might
be
needed
they
procured
from
some
of
the
natives
who
were
glad
to
do
odd
jobs
for
the
summer
people
dolly
followed
dotty
and
genie
upstairs
where
there
was
a
long
row
of
tiny
bedrooms
opening
onto
a
narrow
hall
these
bedrooms
had
ceilings
which
slanted
right
down
to
the
floor
so
one
could
not
stand
upright
after
advancing
a
few
feet
into
the
room
are
they
funny
rooms
said
dotty
laughing
with
glee
at
countenance
but
you
get
used
to
them
soon
of
course
you
have
to
bend
double
except
just
here
by
the
door
but
nothing
this
one
is
yours
dolly
and
mine
is
right
next
and
then
genie
mother
and
father
have
a
room
downstairs
but
we
wo
sleep
here
we
sleep
in
the
open
tent
it
plenty
warm
enough
oh
it
fun
dolly
did
know
what
sleeping
in
an
open
tent
meant
but
she
smiled
in
response
and
soon
the
three
girls
went
downstairs
together
and
rose
were
bustling
around
happily
engaged
in
unpacking
and
arranging
books
and
pictures
and
various
trifles
to
make
the
big
more
homelike
looks
a
little
bare
now
said
rose
as
he
placed
his
smoking
set
in
position
near
his
own
particular
easy
chair
but
in
a
day
or
two
we
have
it
looking
like
a
little
paradise
on
earth
just

dolly
till

see
this
desert
blossom
like
a
rose
like
a
whole
rose
family
in
fact
these
things
help
a
lot
and
rose
deftly
arranged
half
a
dozen
sofa
pillows
on
a
big
couch
and
we
put
up
a
swing
and
the
hammocks
wo
you
daddy
said
genie
course
i
will
chickabiddy
and
rose
whistled
in
gay
contentment
as
he
took
books
from
their
boxes
and
arranged
them
on
the
table
when
supper
was
announced
maria
informed
the
family
that

rose

do
mind
what
we
have
we
get
a
good
fair
start
sit
down
children
we
manage
to
make
out
a
supper
the
supper
was
sort
of
a
makeshift
of
sardines
and
herring
and
crackers
with
coffee
for
the
older
people
dolly
had
no
wish
to
be
critical
but
the
viands
were
not
tempting
and
she
ate
very
little
being
conscious
all
the
time
of
an
lump
in
her
throat
she
tried
hard
to
be
merry
and
gay
but
she
feel
the
enthusiasm
with
which
the
others
overflowed
shall
we
have
a
fire
daddy
asked
dotty
as
they
left
the
table
oh
not
it
pretty
late
and
we
all
tired
out
leave
that
for
night
you
see
dolly
fayre
the
curtain
does
really
rise
on
the
glories
of
camp
crosstrees
until
can
you
wait
yes
indeed
rose
and
dolly
smiled
bravely
where
is
it
that
we
going
to
sleep
i
show
you
said
rose
and
amid
shouts
of
glee
and
peals
of
laughter
dotty
and
genie
ran
upstairs
and
returned
with
their
arms
full
of
blankets
and
other
things
grab
a
pillow
and
come
on
shouted
dotty
as
she
herself
picked
up
a
pillow
from
the
couch
genie
took
one
too
and
dolly
did
also
and
then
the
whole
tribe
left
the
house
they
walked
across
some
very
uneven
ground
and
dolly
would
have
stumbled
in
the
darkness
had
not
rose
clasped
her
arm
firmly
here
we
are
she
said
and
dolly
saw
a
large
tent
but
it
exactly
a
tent
it
was
a
platform
of
boards
raised
not
more
than
a
foot
above
the
ground
it
had
a
roof
and
three
sides
of
canvas
but
the
front
was
entirely
open
on
the
floor
were
piles
of
balsam
boughs
and
on
these
the
roses
arranged
the
blankets
they
had
brought
i
envy
you
girls
said
rose
as
she
tucked
up
the
impromptu
beds
it
is
heavenly
to
sleep
out
here
but
we
older
people
dare
not
risk
rheumatism
you
love
it
dolly
perhaps
you
hear
an
owl
or
two
hooting
you
a
lullaby
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
three
girls
were
put
to
bed
and
rose
had
said
and
left
them
dotty
and
genie
had
murmured
sleepy
and
had
snuggled
down
into
their
nests
of
branches
dolly
lay
with
wide
open
eyes
staring
out
at
the
stars
she
had
never
experienced
this
sort
of
thing
before
and
she
was
frightened
and
uncomfortable
although
the
air
was
chilly
and
she
did
not
like
the
feeling
of
the
rather
coarse
blankets
moreover
she
was
wearing
a
thick
clumsy
flannel
nightgown
and
the
bed
of
branches
seemed
to
be
full
of
knots
and
lumps
she
longed
for
her
own
pretty
room
with
its
dainty
appointments
and
soft
bed
clothing
she
looked
across
at
dotty
and
genie
she
could
see
them
but
dimly
but
she
knew
they
were
sound
asleep
she
felt
alone
utterly
alone
in
that
dreadful
place
with
the
forest
trees
making
a
sad
murmur
and
the
silent
stars
winking
solemnly
at
her
she
thought
of
her
mother
and
father
and
trudy
and
bert
and
she
had
the
most
dreadful
wave
of
homesickness
roll
over
her
then
the
tears
came
hot
scalding
tears
that
rolled
down
her
cheeks
in
ever
increasing
number
she
made
no
noise
lest
she
waken
the
other
girls
but
the
effort
to
stifle
her
sobs
made
her
cry
harder
and
she
buried
her
face
in
the
rough
worsted
of
the
sofa
pillow
and
wiped
her
eyes
with
the
harsh
blanket
oh
mother
she
said
to
herself
i
stay
here
this
is
a
dreadful
place
why
did
you
let
me
come
i
knew
i
would
hate
a
camp
how
can
anybody
like
these
awful
beds
and
i
cold
and
i
not
cold
either
but
i
all
shivery
and
i
feel
horrid
i
i
oh
i
just
lonesome
and
homesick
and
i
want
mother
after
a
time
dolly
stopped
crying
from
sheer
exhaustion
and
spent
with
her
sobs
she
lay
there
gazing
at
the
stars
she
felt
sure
there
were
bears
and
wolves
among
the
trees
and
soon
they
would
come
out
and
attack
the
camp
moreover
she
was
dreadfully
hungry
she
had
a
box
of
candy
in
her
suitcase
but
that
was
upstairs
in
the
bungalow
she
could
not
get
it
without
disturbing
and
rose
and
that
was
not
to
be
thought
of
the
poor
child
lay
for
a
time
in
her
misery
every
moment
getting
more
and
more
homesick
and
with
a
deeper
longing
to
get
back
to
her
mother
and
never
leave
home
again
at
last
a
spirit
of
desperation
took
hold
upon
her
it
was
characteristic
of
dolly
fayre
to
endure
patiently
and
bravely
the
greatest
trials
that
might
come
to
her
but
when
the
strain
became
too
great
it
was
in
her
nature
to
rebel
suddenly
and
decidedly
and
now
when
it
seemed
that
she
simply
could
not
stand
the
dreadfulness
another
moment
she
sat
straight
up
in
bed
and
said
clearly
i
going
home
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
startled
her
and
she
looked
round
quickly
to
see
if
the
other
girls
had
heard
her
she
fully
expected
to
see
one
or
both
heads
pop
up
in
amazement
at
her
speech
but
neither
dark
head
moved
and
listening
to
their
regular
breathing
she
knew
the
two
rose
girls
were
still
sound
asleep
with
her
white
face
set
and
a
desperate
look
in
her
wide
open
blue
eyes
she
put
one
foot
out
of
bed
and
then
the
other
she
had
on
her
stockings
as
rose
had
advised
her
to
wear
them
all
night
silently
and
swiftly
she
discarded
the
flannel
nightgown
which
was
one
of
dotty
and
with
flying
fingers
which
trembled
with
a
nervous
chill
she
rapidly
dressed
herself
in
the
garments
she
had
worn
when
she
arrived
her
hat
and
coat
were
at
the
bungalow
but
she
did
not
stop
for
them
she
was
determined
to
go
home
that
very
minute
and
she
would
let
nothing
interfere
fully
dressed
she
went
over
and
looked
down
at
the
sleeping
dotty
it
seemed
awful
to
go
away
and
leave
her
like
that
but
dolly
knew
if
she
waited
till
morning
the
roses
would
not
let
her
go
and
yet
she
must
leave
word
of
some
sort
or
they
would
think
her
very
rude
and
ungrateful
she
had
with
her
a
little
shopping
bag
which
as
it
contained
some
money
she
had
put
under
her
pillow
luckily
there
was
paper
and
pencil
in
this
on
which
she
had
planned
to
write
a
letter
to
her
mother
so
with
an
uncertain
hand
in
the
dim
light
she
traced
the
words
dear
dotty
i
ca
stay
here
i
got
to
go
back
to
mother
dolly
this
she
slipped
gently
beneath
dotty
pillow
and
then
stepping
softly
to
the
open
edge
of
the
tent
she
stepped
down
to
the
ground
and
walked
swiftly
toward
the
lake
chapter
ix
dolly
escape
dolly
had
learned
as
they
came
up
the
lake
in
the
motor
boat
that
there
was
a
footpath
along
the
lake
shore
which
led
directly
from
the
camp
to
the
railroad
station
it
was
about
a
mile
long
and
passed
several
other
camps
but
dolly
felt
sure
that
she
could
walk
the
distance
and
allowing
time
to
rest
now
and
then
could
reach
the
station
before
six
when
the
first
morning
train
went
through
the
dim
starlight
just
enabled
her
to
make
out
by
her
little
watch
that
it
was
two
when
she
started
she
felt
no
fear
of
bears
or
wolves
now
for
her
whole
mind
and
soul
were
filled
with
the
one
idea
of
going
home
she
would
have
started
had
the
road
been
lined
with
hot
ploughshares
so
indomitable
was
her
will
and
so
strong
her
resolution
she
gave
no
thought
or
heed
to
possible
difficulties
or
dangers
she
knew
the
way
there
was
no
chance
of
getting
lost
and
she
had
in
her
bag
money
enough
to
buy
a
ticket
home
she
felt
guilty
and
even
ashamed
at
leaving
her
kind
friends
in
this
manner
but
that
thought
was
swallowed
up
and
lost
sight
of
in
the
terrible
gnawing
agony
of
her
longing
for
home
so
she
set
forth
along
the
path
at
a
swift
steady
gait
which
promised
fair
for
the
accomplishment
of
her
design
as
she
walked
along
the
stars
seemed
brighter
and
seemed
to
wink
at
her
more
kindly
as
if
willing
to
do
all
they
could
to
help
along
a
poor
little
homesick
child
though
without
hat
or
coat
her
swift
pace
kept
her
warm
enough
for
a
time
but
at
last
poor
little
dolly
grew
very
weary
she
had
not
walked
much
since
her
illness
and
her
newly
mended
leg
felt
the
strain
and
began
to
ache
terribly
she
sat
down
to
rest
on
a
flat
stone
and
was
surprised
to
find
that
her
leg
ached
worse
sitting
down
than
it
had
walking
moreover
when
she
stopped
exercising
she
became
very
chilly
and
in
addition
to
this
she
realised
afresh
that
she
was
exceedingly
hungry
poor
little
dolly
she
could
scarcely
have
been
more
physically
miserable
and
yet
her
material
discomfort
was
as
nothing
to
her
pangs
of
homesickness
she
felt
she
could
not
pursue
her
journey
and
yet
it
made
her
shudder
to
think
of
returning
to
that
awful
camp
so
after
a
time
hoping
she
had
rested
enough
she
rose
and
plodded
on
again
she
kept
up
this
means
of
procedure
walking
until
utterly
exhausted
and
then
stopping
to
rest
until
somehow
she
managed
to
cover
the
distance
to
the
station
it
was
four
when
she
reached
the
forlorn
little
building
and
found
it
closed
and
deserted
but
there
was
a
bench
outside
and
dolly
sank
upon
this
in
a
state
bordering
upon
utter
collapse
she
fell
asleep
there
and
was
only
awakened
when
shortly
before
six
the
station
agent
came
to
unlock
his
office
bless
my
soul
who
are
you
he
exclaimed
and
dolly
sat
up
blinking
in
the
early
sunlight
i
a
passenger
she
said
i
want
to
take
the
early
train
humph
a
pretty
looking
passenger
you
are
where
your
hat
i
do
always
wear
a
hat
in
summer
and
dolly
tossed
back
her
golden
curls
and
looked
at
the
man
steadily
her
sleep
had
refreshed
her
somewhat
and
she
had
recovered
her
poise
her
determination
was
still
unshaken
and
she
had
every
intention
of
going
on
that
six
train
but
the
station
master
was
a
knowing
sort
of
man
and
he
had
before
this
seen
campers
afflicted
with
a
desperate
desire
to
go
back
to
civilisation
did
you
come
up
here
last
night
with
the
roses
he
inquired
affably
yes
replied
dolly
but
i
going
back
to
town
pshaw
now
is
that
so
do
like
it
hey
the
station
master
had
a
kindly
way
with
him
and
as
he
threw
open
the
door
he
invited
dolly
to
enter
the
little
you
stay
here
a
spell
he
said
that
train
ai
due
for
fifteen
minutes
he
disappeared
into
the
ticket
office
and
closed
the
door
then
he
called
up
rose
on
the
telephone
hello
what
is
it
responded
that
gentleman
sleepily
for
he
had
been
roused
from
a
sound
slumber
i
briggs
the
station
agent
that
little
girl
you
brought
with
you
last
night
is
here
in
the
station
says
she
home
dolly
fayre
at
the
station
impossible
yep
she
here
and
she
just
about
all
in
you
do
want
i
should
let
her
go
on
the
train
do
you
good
gracious
no
keep
her
there
somehow
till
i
can

i
try
but
she
terrible
set
on
goin

her
somehow
briggs
if
you
have
to
lock
her
in
i
be
down
there
inside
of
half
an
hour
all
right
rose
briggs
hung
up
the
receiver
and
sauntered
back
to
the
best
come
over
home
with
me
little
miss
and
get
a
bite
of
breakfast
how
about
it
my
home
just
across
the
street
and
my
wife
be
glad
to
give
you
a
snack
thank
you
said
dolly
doubtfully
but
i
do
want
to
miss
that
train
oh
land
she
likely
to
be
half
an
hour
late
come
along
i
keep
my
eye
out
for
the
train
dolly
hesitated
she
was
awfully
hungry
but
it
was
five
minutes
of
six
and
the
train
might
not
be
late
after
all
moreover
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
station
man
was
a
little
too
anxious
perhaps
he
wished
to
detain
her
though
she
could
see
no
reason
why
he
should
interfere
with
her
plans
unless
it
might
be
because
she
had
no
hat
on
still
it
was
not
a
crime
to
go
hatless
in
the
summer
time
though
it
might
be
unconventional
when
travelling
pretty
good
breakfast
my
wife
cooks
said
briggs
temptingly
perhaps
i
would
have
time
just
for
a
glass
of
milk
said
dolly
but
no
i
hear
a
locomotive
whistle
now
aw
she
way
up
round
the
bend
sound
carries
awful
far
these
hills
she
wo
be
here
for
ten
minutes
yet
come
on
what
are
you
talking
about
there
the
train
now
and
from
the
window
dolly
saw
the
smoke
of
the
approaching
engine
why
so
is
and
with
a
strange
smile
on
his
face
briggs
whisked
the
door
open
flew
out
and
slammed
it
behind
him
and
turned
the
big
key
making
dolly
a
prisoner
in
the
little
for
a
moment
she
was
too
amazed
to
do
or
say
anything
she
stood
watching
the
train
draw
nearer
and
stop
at
the
little
station
then
she
realised
what
had
happened
and
she
flew
to
the
door
and
pounded
on
it
with
her
little
fists
crying
let
me
out
you
awful
dreadful
man
let
me
out
but
the
door
did
not
open
and
after
a
couple
of
minutes
the
train
went
on
its
way
then
briggs
unlocked
the
door
and
came
in
bless
my
soul
he
said
if
i
did
forget
you
wanted
to
go
by
that
train
well
it
too
late
now
so
you
might
as
well
come
on
over
to
breakfast
you
did
forget
it
any
such
thing
you
locked
me
in
here
on
purpose
you
had
no
right
to
do
it
and
my
father
will
pers
persecute
you
or
whatever
you
call
it
well
anyhow
the
train
gone
and
you
ca
get
it
back
so
make
the
best
of
things
and
smile
and
come
along
from
sheer
lack
of
anything
better
to
do
dolly
rose
and
walked
with
briggs
across
the
street
to
his
little
cottage
hello
mother
he
called
out
as
they
entered
i
brought
a
visitor
to
breakfast
got
enough
to
go
round
yes
indeedy
and
a
fat
comfortable
looking
woman
smiled
pleasantly
at
dolly
why
you
poor
baby
you
all
tuckered
out
here
sit
right
down
and
drink
this
fresh
milk
it
a
little
warm
yet
take
slow
sips
now
do
swallow
it
all
at
once
here
a
nice
piece
of
toast
dolly
eagerly
accepted
the
fresh
milk
and
the
buttered
toast
and
was
glad
to
follow
briggs
advice
and
partake
slowly
the
warm
pleasant
room
and
the
appetising
food
made
dolly
feel
decidedly
better
a
poached
egg
came
next
and
more
toast
and
milk
and
as
both
and
briggs
were
kind
and
cheery
dolly
spirits
rose
accordingly
no
reference
was
made
as
to
why
she
wanted
to
take
the
train
in
fact
the
subject
was
not
touched
on
and
briggs
was
entertaining
her
with
a
funny
story
when
the
door
opened
and
rose
walked
in
hello
he
said
cheerily
had
your
breakfast
good
for
you
briggs
glad
you
gave
the
little
lady
a
bite
come
along
now
dolly
we
must
be
on
the
move
rose
face
was
so
smiling
and
his
manner
so
pleasant
that
dolly
jumped
up
from
her
chair
and
ran
to
his
side
he
put
his
arm
round
her
and
kissed
her
cheek
and
then
with
brisk
and
thanks
to
the
hospitable
briggs
he
whisked
dolly
away
skip
it
he
said
and
taking
her
hand
they
skipped
across
the
road
and
down
the
long
length
of
the
pier
there
was
rose
waiting
with
long
sam
at
the
wheel
mornin
folkses
he
said
unfolding
his
ungainly
length
as
he
rose
to
help
them
in
long
sam
it
was
generally
agreed
had
the
longest
length
for
the
narrowest
width
of
any
man
in
the
county
he
grinned
at
dolly
and
taking
her
hands
helped
her
into
the
boat
while
rose
followed
in
a
moment
they
were
off
and
the
little
boat
scooted
up
the
lake
in
a
hurry
the
sun
was
well
up
now
and
it
was
a
warm
day
so
the
lake
breeze
was
most
refreshing
and
the
swift
motion
very
exhilarating
rose
said
no
word
whatever
concerning
dolly
informal
departure
from
his
camp
but
he
was
so
gay
and
entertaining
that
dolly
herself
forgot
it
he
pointed
out
various
houses
and
camps
along
the
shore
often
telling
funny
stories
of
the
people
who
lived
there
he
showed
her
the
club
house
and
the
casino
and
the
picnic
grounds
and
lots
of
interesting
places
which
had
passed
unnoticed
on
their
trip
up
the
lake
the
night
before
sometimes
long
sam
put
in
a
few
words
in
his
dry
comical
way
and
dolly
found
herself
enjoying
the
morning
lake
ride
immensely
rose
was
in
the
midst
of
a
funny
story
at
which
dolly
was
shaking
with
laughter
as
they
reached
the
pier
which
belonged
to
crosstrees
camp
out
you
hop
exclaimed
rose
jumping
out
himself
and
in
a
moment
dolly
was
beside
him
on
the
pier
rose
and
the
two
girls
stood
there
smiling
their
arms
full
of
bathing
suits
hurry
up
doll
cried
dotty
grabbing
her
arm
this
is
your
bathhouse
right
next
to
mine
and
here
your
suit
scrabble
into
it
quick
you
can
and
so
almost
before
she
knew
it
dolly
was
shut
in
to
her
little
bath
house
and
was
hastily
changing
from
her
street
suit
to
her
just
as
she
finished
arraying
herself
dotty
was
pounding
on
the
door
and
she
immediately
opened
it
rose
put
a
bathing
cap
on
head
and
tied
a
gay
kerchief
over
that
the
rest
were
all
in
bathing
suits
and
with
gay
laughter
they
all
joined
hands
and
ran
down
the
sloping
shore
and
into
the
lake
dolly
loved
bathing
and
she
pranced
round
with
the
rest
enjoying
the
delightful
feel
of
the
cool
ripples
of
the
lake
as
they
dashed
against
her
the
young
people
were
not
allowed
to
go
out
very
far
alone
but
rose
would
swim
out
with
them
one
at
a
time
for
a
short
distance
and
return
them
safely
to
shallower
water
do
teach
me
to
swim
pleaded
dolly
who
took
to
water
like
a
duck
so
rose
gave
her
her
first
lesson
and
she
was
so
promising
a
pupil
that
he
declared
she
would
soon
learn
to
become
expert
the
bath
over
they
returned
to
the
bath
houses
to
dress
and
dolly
found
in
hers
instead
of
her
travelling
suit
a
serge
skirt
and
middy
blouse
she
put
these
on
and
when
she
went
out
she
found
dotty
similarly
arrayed
rose
braided
the
two
girls
hair
in
long
and
tied
their
ribbons
for
them
now
for
a
camp
breakfast
exclaimed
rose
as
the
group
reunited
i
had
my
breakfast
began
dolly
but
rose
interrupted
her
saying
indeed
you
have
just
wait
till
you
see
in
a
little
clearing
not
far
from
the
bungalow
dolly
saw
a
table
of
boards
with
seats
each
side
and
here
the
family
gathered
such
a
breakfast
as
it
was
maria
had
materialised
and
of
all
light
puffy
golden
delicacies
they
were
the
best
then
there
was
brook
trout
fresh
and
delicious
a
tempting
omelet
and
as
a
great
treat
the
girls
were
each
allowed
a
cup
of
coffee
the
trip
up
the
lake
and
the
invigorating
bath
had
given
dolly
a
ravenous
appetite
and
never
had
food
tasted
so
good
she
did
quite
understand
why
nothing
was
said
about
her
running
away
in
the
night
but
it
was
a
great
relief
that
the
subject
was
not
touched
upon
and
in
the
gay
laughter
and
chatter
of
the
rose
family
she
finally
forgot
all
about
it
now
who
for
a
tramp
in
the
woods
and
rose
lighted
a
cigar
as
he
left
the
table
me
cried
dolly
dancing
up
to
her
host
when
can
we
start
right
away
quick
and
rose
smiled
down
at
her
have
you
good
stout
shoes
yes
indeed
and
dolly
showed
her
little
tan
boots
the
whole
family
started
off
each
with
a
stout
stick
to
help
their
steps
in
climbing
and
each
with
a
little
basket
because
as
rose
said
you
never
can
tell
what
you
find
to
bring
home
they
started
off
briskly
dolly
and
dotty
on
either
side
of
rose
and
genie
and
her
mother
following
close
behind
guess
we
try
the
rocky
chasm
path
this
morning
said
rose
who
acted
as
guide
away
they
went
walking
briskly
but
not
too
rapidly
though
it
was
a
warm
day
the
path
through
the
woods
was
cool
and
pleasant
and
occasionally
they
paused
to
rest
for
a
time
presently
the
climbing
began
and
this
they
took
by
easy
stages
so
that
when
at
last
they
reached
their
goal
dolly
was
not
at
all
tired
what
a
beautiful
place
she
cried
as
they
found
themselves
on
top
of
a
high
hill
looking
down
into
a
rocky
chasm
do
go
too
near
the
edge
warned
rose
as
her
husband
and
the
two
girls
went
to
peer
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
no
indeed
he
returned
but
dolly
must
see
down
in
the
chasm
here
dot
you
show
her
how
so
dotty
lay
down
flat
on
the
rocks
and
wriggled
along
until
she
could
see
over
the
very
edge
while
her
father
held
tightly
to
her
feet
it
wonderful
she
exclaimed
now
you
try
it
dolly
somewhat
timidly
but
with
full
faith
in
rose
dolly
lay
down
prone
and
cautiously
edged
along
till
she
could
see
over
the
shelving
rock
she
felt
rose
firm
grip
on
her
ankles
and
she
looked
down
with
wonder
at
the
sheer
straight
descent
of
rock
and
down
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
chasm
she
saw
a
tiny
brook
tossing
and
foaming
along
not
yet
she
called
as
rose
advised
her
to
come
back
let
me
see
it
a
moment
longer
do
get
dizzy
called
out
rose
no
indeed
said
dolly
as
at
last
rose
pulled
her
in
i
dizzy
a
bit
i
never
saw
anything
so
wonderful
that
beautiful
little
brook
way
down
there
a
thousand
miles
below
oh
not
quite
so
far
as
that
said
rose
laughing
come
on
go
down
and
see
it
from
below
they
picked
up
their
baskets
and
following
rose
direction
they
climbed
down
a
rocky
ravine
and
sure
enough
found
themselves
right
beside
the
little
tumbling
brook
dolly
sat
on
a
rock
and
gazed
upward
at
the
precipice
looking
at
the
very
spot
where
she
had
poked
her
head
over
were
we
really
up
there
looking
down
she
exclaimed
i
can
hardly
believe
it
oh
what
a
lovely
place
this
is
yes
is
it
cried
dotty
let
dig
something
daddy
what
can
we
find
and
rose
looked
around
why
my
goodness
my
basket
is
full
already
what
in
it
cried
genie
scampering
around
to
see
oh
goody
cookies
and
lemonade
though
dolly
had
really
had
two
breakfasts
the
mountain
climb
had
made
her
ready
to
welcome
a
little
light
refreshment
and
the
bottles
of
lemonade
and
the
box
of
cookies
were
rapidly
disposed
of
by
the
party
i
see
indian
pipes
remarked
rose
and
dotty
cried
where
where
those
who
seek
will
find
said
rose
smiling
and
the
girls
set
to
work
hunting
dotty
was
the
first
to
spy
some
of
the
graceful
white
blossoms
under
some
concealing
green
leaves
but
a
moment
later
dolly
found
some
too
with
their
trowels
they
carefully
dug
up
the
plants
and
put
them
in
their
baskets
to
take
home
genie
collected
some
odd
stones
and
rose
found
a
particular
bit
of
eglantine
that
she
wanted
and
soon
the
baskets
were
filled
and
the
party
took
up
their
homeward
way
mostly
of
a
trend
the
way
home
was
easy
and
as
the
baskets
were
not
heavy
the
girls
danced
gaily
along
singing
songs
as
they
went
why
goodness
gracious
sakes
it
nearly
two
cried
dolly
as
they
entered
the
big
living
room
of
the
bungalow
and
set
down
their
burdens
it
is
and
maria
black
face
appeared
in
the
doorway
i
suttinly
thought
was
never
comin
home
to
dinner
been
waitin
and
waitin
till
everything
is
jes
spoilt
oh
i
guess
not
as
bad
as
that
maria
and
rose
smiled
pleasantly
at
her
we
not
much
behind
time
and
we
wo
grumble
if
things
are
cold
laws
sakes
they
ai
cold
dun
looked
out
for
dat
yo
better
wash
that
mud
off
your
hands
and
come
along
doan
waste
no
time
now
the
roses
were
accustomed
to
maria
scoldings
and
they
ran
away
to
follow
her
advice
chapter
x
hidden
treasure
take
time
to
tidy
up
and
put
on
clean
blouses
called
out
rose
as
the
girls
went
to
their
rooms
but
they
made
quick
work
of
it
and
helped
each
other
in
the
matter
of
hair
ribbons
and
soon
three
very
trim
and
tidy
young
persons
in
clean
white
linen
presented
themselves
hungry
for
their
dinner
maria
had
a
steaming
chicken
stew
for
them
with
fluffy
white
dumplings
that
showed
no
sign
of
being
spoilt
in
fact
she
had
not
cooked
them
until
after
the
family
return
was
there
ever
anything
so
good
exclaimed
dolly
as
she
received
a
second
portion
of
the
fricassee
everything
tastes
good
up
here
said
dotty
but
maria
sure
is
a
dandy
on
stewed
chicken
but
go
easy
doll
for
i
happen
to
know
there
an
apple
betty
to
follow
and
just
you
wait
till
you
see
that
but
dolly
camp
appetite
was
quite
equal
to
the
apple
betty
also
which
was
as
dolly
had
predicted
a
triumph
in
the
matter
of
desserts
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
to
a
party
dolly
said
as
they
left
the
table
i
believe
i
eaten
more
than
i
do
in
a
week
at
home
it
the
air
said
rose
crosstrees
air
is
the
greatest
appetiser
known
to
man
if
i
could
bottle
it
and
sell
it
i
make
my
everlasting
fortune
now
may
i
ask
what
you
young
ladies
have
on
hand
for
this
afternoon
nothing
particular
said
dotty
why
because
i
asked
a
few
young
people
from
the
neighbouring
camps
to
come
over
here
for
awhile
a
party
cried
genie
oh
daddy
a
party
not
exactly
a
party
only
half
a
dozen
of
the
norrises
and
holmeses
lovely
cried
dotty
i
have
seen
the
norrises
since
last
year
and
i
do
know
the
holmeses
who
are
they
holmes
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
his
daughter
edith
is
about
the
age
of
you
girls
and
they
have
two
or
three
guests
and
the
norrises
maisie
and
jack
are
awfully
nice
said
dotty
you
like
them
doll
maisie
is
something
like
you
she
is
a
bit
like
dolly
put
in
genie
she
fat
and
yellow
headed
and
blue
eyed
but
she
is
half
as
pretty
as
dolly
so
you
mind
dollyrinda
oh
i
do
mind
and
dolly
laughed
i
do
think
a
towhead
can
be
pretty
anyway
i
like
dark
eyes
and
dark
curls
best
thank
you
and
dotty
dropped
a
curtsey
shall
we
dress
up
mother
no
those
clean
blouses
are
all
right
it
just
a
camp
frolic
not
a
formal
party
it
a
kidd
party
observed
rose
looking
mysterious
a
kid
party
echoed
dotty
of
course
i
did
it
was
a
party
daddy
for
us
children
rose
only
laughed
and
turned
away
and
the
girls
wandered
out
toward
the
open
tent
where
dolly
had
gone
to
bed
the
night
before
the
beds
were
covered
now
with
big
spreads
of
gay
cretonne
and
many
cretonne
pillows
and
served
as
day
couches
the
sight
of
the
tent
recalled
to
dolly
mind
the
events
of
the
night
before
and
she
suddenly
experienced
a
wave
of
embarrassment
and
remorse
at
the
way
she
had
acted
she
felt
too
that
an
apology
was
due
to
her
hosts
and
somehow
it
did
seem
right
to
talk
about
it
to
the
girls
for
she
felt
that
it
was
to
and
rose
she
owed
an
explanation
wait
here
for
me
a
minute
she
said
suddenly
to
dolly
and
genie
and
turning
she
ran
back
to
the
bungalow
she
found
and
rose
in
the
living
room
and
going
straight
to
them
she
said
impulsively
i
was
very
naughty
to
run
away
last
night
and
i
want
to
apologise
you
see
i
got
homesick
bless
your
heart
do
say
a
word
about
it
said
rose
in
the
kindest
tones
that
part
of
the
performance
child
everybody
gets
homesick
the
first
night
in
camp
it
to
be
expected
then
you
see
the
next
day
they
begin
to
like
it
and
the
third
day
you
could
drive
them
home
but
i
was
very
impolite
to
go
away
like
that
never
mind
dollikins
and
rose
put
her
arm
around
her
little
visitor
it
all
right
dearie
do
think
of
it
again
i
know
perfectly
well
how
forlorn
you
felt
and
how
you
wanted
your
mother
and
i
know
too
you
were
chilly
and
you
felt
strange
and
lonesome
and
could
sleep
but
that
all
over
now
and
we
wo
even
think
of
it
again
if
you
do
sleep
all
right
and
if
you
want
to
go
home
i
take
you
down
myself
right
straight
to
where
your
mother
is
now
put
it
all
out
of
your
mind
and
scamper
back
to
dotty
the
party
will
be
coming
pretty
soon
now
run
along
and
rose
patted
the
golden
head
you
would
have
been
the
right
kind
of
a
guest
at
all
if
you
had
been
homesick
the
first
night
but
i
bet
you
a
ripe
red
apple
that
you
wo
want
to
go
home
but
if
you
do
want
to
you
shall
now
skip
along
for
if
i
not
mistaken
i
hear
a
motor
boat
and
like
as
not
it
that
bunch
from
the
holmes
dolly
ran
away
her
heart
greatly
lightened
by
the
kind
attitude
of
her
hosts
and
though
she
felt
sorry
she
had
run
away
the
night
before
she
did
not
feel
so
ashamed
since
they
had
so
pleasantly
made
light
of
it
sure
enough
the
party
of
young
people
were
just
coming
along
the
pier
and
edith
holmes
a
bright
girl
of
about
dolly
age
was
introducing
herself
and
her
friends
i
edith
holmes
she
said
laughing
and
these

my
cousins
guy
and
elmer
they
nice
enough
boys
but
here
their
sister
josie
who
is
nicer
yet
josie
was
a
shy
little
thing
who
blushed
and
cast
down
her
eyes
at
edith
praise
i
thought
the
norrises
would
be
here
went
on
edith
and
as
they
know
us
and
know
you
they
could
introduce
us
better

my
chum
dolly
fayre
and
my
little
sister
genie

a
brother

smiled
at
the
boys
as
she
said
this
and
elmer
holmes
said
that

matter

just
love
to
play
with
girls
and
anyhow
here

jack
norris
to
keep
us
in
countenance

camp
they
were
acquainted
with
the
holmes
young
people
as
both
families
had
been
there
all
summer
introductions
over
they
all
sat
along
the
edge
of
the
open
tent
the
floor
of
this
being
only
about
a
foot
above
ground
made
a
convenient
seat
and
those
who
wished
had
cushions
to
sit
on
or
lean
against
awful
glad
you
people
got
up
here
at
last
said
maisie
norris
as
she
twisted
one
of
dotty
curls
round
her
finger
is
your
arm
all
well
dot
yes
though
it
is
awfully
strong
yet
i
have
to
be
a
little
careful
but
it
was
my
left
one
you
know
so
i
can
play
croquet
and
tennis
and
do
most
everything
you
had
a
gay
old
mixup
did
you
said
jack
norris
smiling
at
dolly
you
broke
yourself
too
did
you
oh
yes
you
know
dotty
and
i
are
neighbours
this
year
and
whatever
one
of
us
does
the
other
has
to
but
we
both
mended
now
and
ready
for
any
sort
of
fun
then
rose
came
along
bringing
about
a
dozen
spades
they
were
small
ones
such
as
come
with
children
gardening
tools
and
he
gave
one
to
each
of
the
young
people
present
what
for
asked
elmer
holmes
as
he
looked
at
the
shining
new
tool
i
told
my
girls
that
this
was
to
be
a
kidd
party
said
rose
but
they
did
quite
understand
what
i
meant
now
i
explain
has
each
one
a
spade
yes
and
the
nine
boys
and
girls
held
them
up
all
right
then
now
what
you
want
to
do
is
to
dig
for
captain
buried
treasure
you
have
all
heard
that
old
captain
kidd
buried
a
lot
of
treasure
somewhere
but
i
doubt
if
you
were
aware
that
he
buried
it
in
crosstrees
camp
however
there
is
a
tradition
to
that
effect
and
so
i
would
like
you
to
do
your
best
to
find
it
tradition
says
that
the
treasure
was
buried
somewhere
near
the
spot
where
we
are
now
it
is
hidden
i
believe
not
farther
than
fifty
feet
away
in
any
direction
from
this
open
tent
so
everybody
may
dig
wherever
he
chooses
within
that
radius
and
see
if
he
can
unearth
the
treasure
but
daddy
said
genie
how
do
we
know
where
to
dig
that
you
must
decide
for
yourselves
dig
any
place
you
like
turn
up
the
whole
area
if
you
choose
or
if
you
see
a
place
that
seems
especially
hopeful
dig
there
i
feel
sure
the
treasure
is
really
buried
somewhere
around
and
it
up
to
you
young
people
to
discover
where
it
may
be
we
find
it
and
jack
norris
brandished
his
spade
in
the
air
come
on
girls
and
boys
let
dig
down
to
china
if
necessary
but
let
get
kidd
old
treasure
chest
the
young
people
scattered
looking
about
for
probable
places
to
dig
dolly
a
little
unused
to
digging
began
rather
aimlessly
to
toss
up
the
soil
near
by
where
she
stood
oh
i
say
said
jack
norris
do
start
in
that
way
come
along
with
me
and
let
find
a
place
that
looks
promising
they
walked
away
looking
eagerly
at
the
ground
about
them
when
dolly
spied
something
white
under
the
leaves
of
a
vine
oh
look
here
she
cried
and
jack
stooped
down
to
see
what
it
was
they
saw
a
grinning
skull
and
cross
bones
made
of
white
plaster
and
partly
sunken
in
the
earth
geewhillikens
we
struck
it
cried
jack
or
rather
you
have
i
felt
sure
from
that
twinkle
in
rose
eye
that
there
was
some
way
of
knowing
where
to
dig
this
is
it
of
course
the
treasure
is
buried
here
let
dig
for
it
carefully
setting
aside
the
little
skull
which
was
only
a
toy
they
both
began
to
dig
desperately
the
ground
is
soft
it
has
lately
been
dug
you
see
to
plant
the
box
here
how
lucky
you
saw
that
white
thing
under
the
leaves
you
would
have
seen
it
if
i
had
said
dolly
not
wanting
to
take
all
the
credit
to
herself
it
buried
pretty
deep
is
it
yes
sort
of
do
you
dig
any
more
if
you
tired
i
dig
the
rest
of
the
way
dolly
paused
a
few
moments
and
jack
went
on
digging
at
last
he
said
as
he
straightened
himself
up
and
wiped
his
brow
with
his
handkerchief
do
you
know
i
believe
we
hoaxed
i
believe
that
skull
was
there
to
fool
us
oh
i
bet
it
was
and
dolly
eyes
danced
as
she
realised
the
situation
maybe
there
are
other
skulls
in
other
places
i
should
wonder
let
go
and
see
let
fill
up
this
hole
first
and
put
the
skull
back
to
fool
somebody
else
all
right
and
jack
hastily
tossed
the
dirt
back
into
the
hole
and
replaced
the
little
white
skull
somebody
is
coming
this
way
let
hide
and
dolly
and
jack
quickly
whisked
themselves
behind
a
clump
of
trees
guy
holmes
and
maisie
norris
came
along
and
they
spied
the
white
skull
which
jack
had
left
placed
rather
more
conspicuously
than
he
had
found
it
oh
look
at
that
cried
guy
and
maisie
exclaimed
this
is
the
right
place
of
course
we
struck
it
at
last
that
pirate
flag
was
just
to
fool
us
hooray
let
dig
dolly
and
jack
could
scarcely
keep
from
laughing
aloud
as
they
saw
the
newcomers
digging
desperately
in
the
very
spot
they
had
dug
themselves
at
last
jack
beckoned
to
dolly
and
they
softly
glided
away
without
letting
the
others
know
of
their
presence
now
we
want
to
find
where
it
really
is
whispered
jack
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
hearing
of
the
others
i
say
this
is
a
great
game
and
we
learned
something
from
those
people
the
spot
marked
with
a
pirate
flag
is
not
the
right
one
when
we
find
that
there
is
no
use
of
digging
the
pair
went
on
prospecting
for
a
likely
place
to
dig
there
were
so
many
trees
and
shrubs
that
often
there
would
be
no
view
of
any
of
the
other
seekers
and
then
again
they
would
come
across
groups
of
two
or
three
or
perhaps
one
alone
digging
desperately
or
looking
disappointed
at
a
failure
gay
greetings
were
exchanged
or
words
of
sympathy
and
commiseration
and
each
went
on
his
chosen
way
do
you
know
said
jack
at
last
i
should
be
surprised
if
the
real
place
is
marked
at
all
hullo
what
this
right
at
his
feet
lay
a
toy
though
made
of
pasteboard
it
was
a
affair
and
the
spot
where
it
was
had
not
been
disturbed
i
do
believe
that
the
right
place
said
jack
who
had
grown
suspicious
of
misleading
clues
anyway
dolly
let
leave
that
and
come
back
to
it
if
we
do
find
anything
more
hopeful
so
they
wandered
on
and
next
they
came
to
the
pirate
flag
this
black
and
white
emblem
was
planted
above
a
much
dug
up
space
and
they
laughed
as
they
concluded
that
several
trials
had
been
made
there
soon
they
came
upon
dotty
and
josie
holmes
who
were
hastily
digging
at
a
spot
which
had
been
marked
by
two
stakes
they
had
pulled
up
the
stakes
but
as
yet
had
not
found
any
treasure
bet
it
is
there
said
jack
looking
closely
at
the
two
stakes
why
demanded
dotty
dunno
somehow
it
does
seem
it
is
come
on
dolly
let
try
again
go
on
said
dotty
i
think
this
is
the
place
josie
and
i
feel
certain
of
it
go
on
you
two
and
good
luck
to
you
shouldering
their
spades
jack
and
dolly
trudged
on
let
think
it
out
said
jack
seating
himself
on
a
flat
rock
while
dolly
did
likewise
i
believe
we
can
think
out
where
rose
would
have
been
likely
to
put
the
thing
now
i
do
believe
it
would
be
very
close
to
where
he
started
us
these
nearby
digging
places
are
all
frauds
let
go
to
the
limit
of
the
space
he
said
and
try
all
the
edge
how
can
you
tell
and
dolly
looked
at
him
with
a
puzzled
expression
why
he
said
fifty
feet
you
know
and
i
can
pace
off
what
ought
to
be
about
fifty
feet
and
then
we
walk
all
the
way
round
they
did
this
and
as
they
walked
round
the
circle
which
jack
declared
was
about
the
boundary
of
the
radius
they
soon
came
upon
a
iron
key
this
is
it
cried
jack
we
struck
it
this
is
the
key
to
the
chest
and
the
chest
is
buried
here
good
work
and
guy
holmes
and
maisie
norris
appeared
just
in
time
to
hear
jack
exclamation
come
on
let
all
dig
no
said
dolly
sitting
down
on
the
ground
i
ca
dig
any
more
too
tired
maisie
and
i
will
sit
here
while
you
boys
do
the
digging
all
right
the
boys
agreed
and
they
fell
to
work
with
a
will
they
had
thrown
out
but
a
few
spadefulls
of
dirt
when
they
struck
something
hard
hooray
hurroo
cried
guy
we
got
it
we
struck
the
treasure
sure
we
have
and
jack
flung
out
the
dirt
excitedly
easy
there
now
old
fellow
look
out
it
the
chest
sure
enough
the
two
girls
jumped
up
and
ran
to
look
as
the
boys
uncovered
one
corner
of
what
seemed
to
be
an
old
chest
it
is
it
is
cried
dolly
we
found
it
hooray
everybody
found
the
treasure
as
her
voice
rang
out
the
others
left
their
digging
and
all
congregated
about
the
lucky
finders
other
spades
were
set
to
work
and
in
a
short
time
willing
hands
lifted
the
old
chest
from
the
hole
and
set
it
up
on
the
solid
earth
it
locked
cried
somebody
as
several
tried
to
open
it
at
once
of
course
it
is
said
dolly
do
you
remember
jack
it
was
the
key
that
first
showed
us
where
it
was
what
did
you
do
with
that
key
i
do
know
and
jack
norris
began
looking
around
i
know
said
dolly
laughing
you
left
it
on
the
ground
and
you
spaded
out
the
dirt
all
over
it
now
you
have
to
dig
for
the
key
that
just
what
i
did
do
if
i
not
the
chump
and
jack
began
to
dig
in
the
heap
of
dirt
they
had
thrown
up
out
of
the
hole
toss
it
back
in
the
hole
cried
guy
and
in
a
jiffy
the
dirt
was
flung
back
where
it
came
from
and
the
key
was
discovered
do
let
open
the
box
here
said
dolly
i
think
we
ought
to
take
it
to
rose
first
i
think
so
too
agreed
jack
norris
and
the
boys
carried
the
big
box
while
dolly
and
the
girls
followed
with
the
key
here
you
are
captain
kidd
cried
jack
as
they
met
rose
already
coming
to
meet
them
found
it
did
you
said
that
gentleman
smiling
at
the
band
of
treasure
seekers
bring
it
along
and
we
open
it
they
all
followed
him
to
the
bungalow
veranda
and
there
the
treasure
chest
was
unlocked
it
contained
a
little
souvenir
for
everybody
present
and
there
were
exclamations
of
delight
over
the
pretty
trinkets
that
were
found
tied
up
in
dainty
tissue
paper
parcels
that
did
not
look
at
all
as
if
they
had
been
prepared
by
captain
kidd
or
his
pirate
crew
dolly
gift
was
a
pretty
writing
tablet
well
furnished
and
upon
which
she
declared
she
should
write
a
long
letter
home
telling
of
the
treasure
hunt
and
its
success
later
on
a
jolly
picnic
supper
was
served
to
the
young
people
and
before
this
was
finished
the
sun
had
set
and
the
stars
were
beginning
to
show
above
the
tall
trees
now
for
a
real
said
rose
leading
the
way
to
the
open
tent
come
on
boys
and
help
me
fetch
wood
the
boys
followed
their
host
and
under
direction
of
rose
and
dotty
the
open
tent
was
transformed
into
a
cosy
and
inviting
place
hemlock
and
spruce
boughs
were
thrown
about
and
partly
covered
with
indian
blankets
and
many
cushions
and
pillows
and
mats
of
woven
rattan
rose
and
the
girls
arranged
themselves
comfortably
in
this
spicy
nest
and
when
the
boys
returned
with
arms
full
of
fagots
and
brush
rose
superintended
the
building
of
a
glorious
fire
right
in
front
of
the
open
tent
then
the
party
all
gathered
together
and
sang
songs
and
told
stories
and
cracked
jokes
in
merry
mood
the
blazing
fire
cast
grotesque
shadows
all
about
and
the
merry
crackling
blaze
was
a
joy
of
itself
boxes
of
marshmallows
made
their
appearance
and
faces
took
on
a
rosy
glow
as
the
young
people
toasted
the
white
lumps
of
delight
on
the
ends
of
long
forks
provided
by
maria
i
never
had
such
a
good
time
in
my
life
exclaimed
dolly
her
eyes
dancing
and
her
cheeks
rosy
as
she
scampered
around
the
fire
do
you
like
camping
asked
jack
norris
looking
admiringly
at
the
pretty
laughing
face
i
just
love
it
dolly
cried
and
everybody
wondered
why
all
the
rose
family
chuckled
with
glee
have
you
ever
been
up
here
before
asked
jack
no
i
never
saw
a
before
i
had
no
idea
these
things
were
such
fun
this
has
been
the
most
beautiful
day
in
my
life
and
dolly
looked
roguishly
up
into
the
face
of
rose
who
chanced
to
be
passing
by
and
i
thank
you
for
it
she
added
slipping
her
hand
into
his
rose
gave
her
little
hand
a
warm
welcoming
grasp
as
he
answered
i
awfully
glad
you
enjoying
it
and
you
are
very
welcome
to
camp
crosstrees
chapter
xi
a
thrilling
experience
after
that
the
days
just
fairly
flew
dolly
changed
her
mind
completely
and
concluded
that
camp
life
was
one
of
the
jolliest
things
in
the
world
talking
things
over
with
dotty
she
explained
her
lonesomeness
and
homesickness
that
first
night
yes
i
understand
and
dotty
wagged
her
head
sagaciously
most
everybody
does
like
camp
at
first
and
we
did
have
any
fun
that
first
night
but
you
see
we
all
knew
the
fun
was
coming
next
days
and
you
did
it
was
partly
that
said
dolly
honestly
and
partly
i
felt
that
i
see
mother
you
see
i
never
been
away
from
her
all
night
before
and
it
was
so
queer
sleeping
outdoors
and
i
was
sort
of
cold
and
i
know
you
were
hungry
there
nothing
makes
anybody
as
homesick
as
being
hungry
supper
was
skinny
that
night
i
remember
and
i
was
hungry
too
only
i
went
to
sleep
and
forgot
all
about
it
come
on
doll
go
over
to
the
norrises
all
right
and
having
informed
rose
of
their
intention
the
two
girls
set
off
for
the
norris
camp
which
was
but
a
short
distance
away
to
their
disappointment
when
they
reached
there
they
learned
that
norris
had
taken
both
maisie
and
jack
to
town
with
her
to
do
some
shopping
and
they
would
not
be
back
before
six
it
was
sarah
the
nurse
girl
who
told
them
this
as
she
sat
on
the
verandah
taking
care
of
gladys
the
norris
baby
let

a
few
minutes
and
play
with
the
kiddy
said
dolly
patting
the
little
fat
hand
of
the
smiling
child
all
right
agreed
dotty
let
take
her
in
the
swing
the
two
girls
with
gladys
between
them
sat
in
the
wide
porch
swing
and
sarah
said
diffidently
would
you
two
young
ladies
mind
keeping
the
baby
for
half
an
hour
while
i
run
down
the
road
a
piece
to
see

sister

long
as
you
want
to
sarah
i
just
love
to
take
care
of
babies
so
sarah
went
away
and
the
two
girls
proceeded
to
give
gladys
the
time
of
her
life
they
soon
tired
of
the
swing
and
took
the
baby
out
into
the
woods
where
they
crowned
her
with
leaves
and
called
her
queen
of
the
may
the
child
laughed
and
crowed
and
as
her
language
was
limited
she
called
both
the
girls
doddy
and
beamed
on
them
both
impartially
herself
she
called
daddy
being
unable
to
achieve
her
own
name
two
doddies
take
daddy
she
cried
waving
her
fat
hands
toward
the
lake
oh
no
said
dolly
daddy
go
when
jack
comes
home
no
no
wait
for
dak
daddy
to
go
saily
daddy
go
in
boat
two
doddy
go
in
boat
and
sail
daddy
far
far
away
the
two
little
arms
waved
as
if
indicating
a
journey
round
the
world
and
the
baby
face
beamed
so
coaxingly
that
dolly
could
resist
it
we
go
down
to
the
shore
she
said
and
gladys
can
paddle
her
hands
in
the
water
that
will
be
nice
ess
and
the
baby
danced
with
glee
as
the
three
went
down
to
the
lake
there
was
a
short
bit
of
fairly
good
beach
at
the
norrises
place
and
here
the
children
sat
down
to
play
a
sail
boat
a
row
boat
and
a
canoe
were
tied
there
and
soon
gladys
renewed
her
plea
to
go
sailing
the
girls
tried
to
divert
her
mind
for
they
were
not
willing
to
take
the
responsibility
of
taking
the
little
girl
out
on
the
water
maybe
we
might
take
her
out
in
the
row
boat
suggested
dotty
but
dolly
said
no
i
rather
not
i
can
row
well
enough
but
you
ca
do
much
with
your
weak
arm
and
suppose
anything
should
happen
to
this
blessed
child
no
siree
dot
i
not
going
to
take
any
such
risk
i
think
you
silly
we
could
row
around
near
shore
and
it
would
please
the
baby
a
heap
she
going
to
cry
if
you
do
dotty
prediction
seemed
in
imminent
danger
of
being
fulfilled
but
dolly
sprang
up
and
began
a
frolicking
song
and
dance
intended
to
divert
the
baby
attention
but
for
a
few
moments
only
gladys
was
pleased
with
this
entertainment
with
the
persistency
of
her
kind
she
returned
again
and
again
to
the
subject
of
her
greatly
desired
water
trip
still
being
denied
she
set
up
a
first
class
crying
act
it
scarcely
seemed
possible
that
so
many
tears
could
come
from
those
two
blue
eyes
she
did
scream
or
howl
but
she
cried
desperately
continuously
and
with
heartbroken
sobs
until
the
two
caretakers
were
filled
with
consternation
no
effort
to
divert
her
was
successful
in
no
game
or
play
would
she
show
any
interest
and
as
the
little
face
grew
red
from
the
continued
sobbing
dotty
exclaimed
that
child
will
have
a
fit
if
she
get
what
she
wants
now
look
here
doll
we
wo
go
in
a
boat
but
let
put
the
baby
in
the
canoe
and
just
pull
her
back
and
forth
gently
by
the
rope
it
tied
fast
to
the
post
dolly
looked
doubtful
but
as
the
baby
sensed
dotty
words
a
heavenly
smile
broke
over
her
face
and
she
exclaimed
ess
ess
daddy
go
all
aloney
dolly
still
hesitated
but
dotty
picked
up
the
eager
child
and
plumped
her
down
in
the
middle
of
the
canoe
which
was
partly
drawn
up
on
the
shelving
beach
a
little
push
set
it
afloat
and
grasping
the
rope
firmly
dotty
gently
pushed
and
pulled
the
canoe
back
and
forth
while
the
baby
squealed
with
delight
that
ca
do
any
harm
said
dotty
pleased
with
the
success
of
her
scheme
and
dolly
agreed
that
gladys
was
safe
enough
as
long
as
she
sat
still
even
if
she
should
spill
out
she
only
get
wet
said
dotty
the
water
is
six
inches
deep
where
she
is
and
you
sit
still
wo
you
baby
ess
daddy
sit
still
and
the
baby
folded
her
hands
and
sat
motionless
in
the
canoe
only
swaying
slightly
with
the
motion
as
dotty
slowly
pulled
her
in
shore
and
then
let
her
drift
back
again
it
like
a
cradle
said
dolly
i
hold
the
rope
for
awhile
dot
all
right
take
it
it
hurts
your
hand
a
little
after
awhile
so
dolly
pulled
the
rope
and
the
two
girls
sitting
on
the
beach
chatted
away
while
the
baby
floated
back
and
forth
let
me
take
it
now
said
dotty
after
a
time
you
must
be
tired
no
i
not
a
bit
tired
and
i
can
use
two
hands
while
you
can
use
only
one
you
ought
to
use
that
left
flapper
of
yours
much
while
weak
dot
pooh
it
is
weak
it
as
strong
as
anything
give
me
that
rope
no
sir
i
wo
do
it
and
there
was
a
scuffle
for
the
possession
of
the
rope
as
the
four
hands
grabbed
at
it
and
each
pair
tried
to
get
the
other
pair
off
let
go
you
cried
dotty
pulling
at
dolly
hands
let
go
yourself
dolly
replied
laughingly
and
then
they
never
knew
quite
how
it
happened
but
somehow
their
scramble
had
pulled
the
rope
loose
from
the
post
and
as
they
twisted
each
other
hands
the
rope
slipped
away
from
them
and
slid
away
under
the
water
the
lake
was
full
of
cross
currents
and
even
before
they
realised
what
had
happened
the
canoe
was
several
feet
from
shore
to
gladys
it
seemed
like
some
new
game
and
she
clapped
her
hands
and
shouted
in
glee
daddy
saily
all
aloney
far
far
away
she
waved
her
baby
arms
and
rocked
back
and
forth
in
joy
dotty
and
dolly
were
for
a
moment
paralysed
with
fright
then
dotty
grabbing
dolly
arm
said
stand
there
like
that
we
must
something
that
baby
will
drown
let
holler
for
help
dotty
tried
to
scream
but
her
heart
was
beating
so
wildly
and
her
nerves
pulsing
so
rapidly
she
could
make
scarcely
any
sound
and
her
wail
of
agony
died
away
in
a
whisper
i
ca
yell
either
said
dolly
hoarsely
as
she
trembled
like
a
leaf
but
we
must
something
go
to
pieces
dotty
go
to
pieces
nothing
you
going
to
faint
yourself
now
stop
it
dollyrinda
and
dotty
gave
her
a
shake
we
got
to
save
that
child
no
matter
how
we
do
it
sit
still
baby
wo
you
she
called
to
gladys
but
the
child
bounced
about
in
her
freedom
and
grasping
each
side
of
the
canoe
with
her
little
hands
began
to
rock
it
as
hard
as
her
baby
strength
would
allow
oh
breathed
dolly
who
was
watching
with
staring
eyes
sit
still
little
gladys
do
rock
the
boat
dearie
ess
in
a
saily
boat
and
again
gladys
swayed
the
little
craft
from
side
to
side
we
must
make
her
stop
that
first
of
all
and
dotty
wrung
her
hands
as
she
stepped
down
to
the
water
edge
and
even
into
the
water
as
she
called
to
the
baby
gladys
sit
very
still
and
doddy
come
out
there
in
another
boat
sit
still
gladys
did
sit
still
and
the
canoe
floated
steadily
on
the
smooth
lake
but
it
drifted
farther
and
farther
from
land
and
now
about
twenty
feet
of
water
separated
the
baby
from
the
shore
we
got
to
get
in
the
row
boat
and
go
out
there
said
dotty
who
was
already
untying
the
rope
yes
it
the
only
thing
to
do
agreed
dolly
but
you
ca
row
dot
and
i
can
so
i
take
the
boat
and
you
run
for
help
i
do
know
whether
you
better
go
to
the
norrises
i
do
think
there
anybody
there
but
the
cook
or
whether
you
better
make
straight
for
home
and
get
your
father
to
come
i
do
both
i
can
run
if
i
ca
row
and
dotty
flew
off
like
a
deer
up
the
hill
toward
the
norris
camp
dolly
stepped
into
the
boat
and
shipped
the
oars
it
was
a
large
boat
and
the
oars
were
heavy
dolly
knew
how
to
row
but
she
was
not
expert
at
it
and
too
she
dreaded
to
turn
around
with
her
back
to
the
baby
though
she
thought
to
herself
in
an
agony
of
conflicting
ideas
i
got
to
row
out
there
and
i
ca
do
it
and
keep
watch
of
gladys
both
she
pulled
a
few
strokes
twisting
her
head
between
each
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
baby
who
was
now
sitting
quietly
in
the
canoe
drifting
out
toward
the
middle
of
the
lake
not
a
motor
boat
or
craft
of
any
kind
that
might
lend
assistance
was
in
sight
they
were
at
the
extreme
upper
end
of
the
lake
and
most
of
the
camps
were
farther
down
vainly
dolly
scanned
the
water
for
a
boat
of
any
kind
but
saw
none
bravely
she
pulled
at
the
big
oars
but
she
was
not
an
athletic
girl
and
having
been
laid
up
so
long
with
a
broken
leg
her
muscles
were
weak
she
pulled
as
hard
as
she
could
in
a
straight
line
toward
the
canoe
but
though
she
succeeded
in
lessening
the
distance
between
them
she
could
not
get
very
near
the
baby
for
the
canoe
drifted
steadily
away
at
last
by
almost
superhuman
efforts
she
came
within
a
few
feet
of
the
child
and
then
fearing
to
bump
into
the
canoe
and
upset
it
she
turned
around
and
tried
to
back
water
gently
but
the
big
oars
were
ungainly
and
the
task
was
not
easy
moreover
gladys
was
overjoyed
at
seeing
dolly
in
the
other
boat
and
she
expressed
her
joy
by
leaning
over
the
side
of
the
canoe
dolly
heart
seemed
to
stop
beating
as
she
saw
the
wobbly
little
boat
careen
with
the
laughing
baby
leaning
far
over
the
edge
she
knew
she
must
not
alarm
the
child
and
so
in
a
desperate
endeavour
to
speak
naturally
she
called
out
sit
up
straight
baby
see
how
straight
you
can
sit
so
straight
and
gladys
emphasised
her
straightness
by
putting
both
arms
up
in
the
air
yes
dear
now
fold
your
arms
and
sit
straight
gladys
obeyed
and
folded
her
chubby
arms
and
sat
motionless
right
in
the
middle
of
the
canoe
dolly
heart
bounded
with
thankfulness
as
with
aching
arms
she
pushed
her
way
nearer
the
drifting
canoe
she
was
moving
stern
first
and
tried
to
manoeuvre
to
try
to
come
up
sideways
against
the
canoe
then
if
she
could
lift
the
baby
safely
into
her
own
boat
she
would
be
content
to
drift
about
until
help
came
how
many
times
she
tried
but
just
as
her
boat
would
near
the
other
a
chance
current
or
a
puff
of
wind
would
take
the
canoe
just
out
of
her
reach
paddling
now
with
one
oar
she
came
very
near
the
unsteady
little
craft
so
near
that
gladys
suddenly
decided
to
jump
into
dolly
boat
the
child
scrambled
to
her
knees
and
leaned
over
the
side
of
the
canoe
till
she
was
almost
in
the
water
sit
down
screamed
dolly
frantically
forgetting
the
danger
of
suddenness
gladys
was
startled
and
instead
of
sitting
down
leaned
farther
over
the
edge
and
the
canoe
capsized
dolly
face
blanched
her
oars
dropped
from
her
hands
and
every
muscle
in
her
body
went
limp
then
the
impulse
came
to
jump
in
the
water
after
the
child
seizing
the
she
was
about
to
plunge
blindly
heedlessly
but
obeying
the
irresistible
impulse
when
something
white
appeared
on
the
water
right
at
her
very
side
it
was
gladys
white
dress
and
dolly
made
a
grab
for
it
just
as
it
was
again
about
to
sink
from
sight
she
held
on
firmly
though
it
seemed
as
if
her
strength
was
ebbing
rapidly
away
she
strove
with
all
her
might
to
pull
the
baby
into
her
own
boat
but
she
could
not
lift
the
heavy
child
over
the
edge
how
glad
she
was
now
that
she
was
in
the
big
boat
which
was
in
little
if
any
danger
of
upsetting
not
knowing
whether
the
baby
was
dead
or
alive
she
hung
on
to
the
precious
burden
still
trying
to
lift
her
over
the
edge
but
unable
to
do
so
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
keep
her
grasp
on
the
wet
clothing
and
keep
the
child
head
above
water
as
the
eddies
tossed
her
boat
around
on
the
rough
surface
of
the
lake
the
waves
were
choppy
and
every
time
she
would
nearly
succeed
in
lifting
the
baby
in
a
sudden
lurch
would
almost
make
her
lose
her
grip
it
was
when
at
last
she
almost
felt
the
little
form
slipping
from
her
grasp
that
she
heard
the
of
a
motor
boat
and
a
cheery
loud
voice
sang
out
hang
on
dolly
hang
on
all
right
we
coming
dolly
did
dare
look
up
but
with
her
last
ounce
of
strength
she
hung
on
to
the
baby
white
dress
which
she
had
already
torn
to
ribbons
in
her
clutches
she
heard
the
swift
oncoming
of
the
motor
boat
and
feared
lest
its
waves
might
even
yet
wash
the
little
form
away
that
she
held
so
insecurely
she
refused
to
lift
her
eyes
as
the
sound
of
the
engine
grew
louder
and
she
felt
a
sickening
fear
of
the
first
waves
that
might
reach
her
from
the
motor
boat
to
her
dismay
she
felt
her
hold
loosening
her
muscles
were
powerless
longer
to
stand
the
strain
of
the
baby
weight
she
heard
the
motor
and
she
felt
or
imagined
she
did
the
first
of
the
rhythmic
waves
that
would
she
felt
certain
as
they
grew
stronger
tear
the
child
from
her
grasp
in
desperation
she
bunched
up
a
portion
of
the
little
white
dress
and
leaning
her
head
down
clinched
it
firmly
in
her
teeth
but
even
as
she
did
so
she
knew
she
could
not
hold
it
there
the
wet
cloth
choked
her
and
the
water
dashed
in
her
face
and
blinded
her
a
sickening
conviction
came
to
her
that
it
was
all
over
and
in
another
instant
little
gladys
would
fall
away
from
her
helpless
hands
and
drown
but
to
her
ears
there
came
a
sound
of
a
human
voice
not
a
shout
not
even
a
loud
call
but
a
calm
pleasant
voice
close
to
her
that
said
all
right
dolly
let
go
you
have
saved
gladys
mechanically
obeying
though
scarcely
knowing
what
she
did
dolly
opened
her
teeth
and
as
the
baby
slid
from
her
numbed
fingers
the
child
was
grasped
by
strong
arms
and
rose
face
appeared
to
dolly
view
he
had
swum
from
the
motor
boat
and
now
holding
gladys
in
one
arm
he
hung
on
to
the
row
boat
with
the
other
take
her
in
he
said
as
he
lifted
the
child
over
the
edge
into
the
boat
the
reaction
brought
back
dolly
lost
nerve
gladly
she
received
the
little
form
in
her
arms
and
in
another
moment
rose
had
himself
scrambled
big
and
dripping
into
the
boat
also
you
little
trump
he
exclaimed
you
brick
you
heroine
let
me
take
the
baby
why
she
all
right
gladys
though
she
had
been
partly
unconscious
while
in
the
water
was
really
unharmed
and
as
rose
held
her
to
him
she
opened
her
eyes
and
smiled
swiftly
the
motor
boat
came
and
took
the
three
on
board
and
dragging
the
row
boat
behind
them
they
made
quickly
for
the
shore
well
i
swan
exclaimed
long
sam
who
was
at
the
wheel
if
you
dolly
ai
the
rippenest
little
mortal
however
you
managed
to
keep
a
grip
on
that
there
kid
is
i
can
tell
i
sure
i
ca
tell
you
and
dolly
smiled
out
of
sheer
happiness
at
gladys
safety
they
reached
the
shore
in
a
few
moments
and
rose
was
there
with
a
big
blanket
in
which
to
wrap
the
baby
while
they
carried
her
up
to
the
house
sarah
the
nurse
was
there
and
soon
gladys
warmed
and
fed
and
arrayed
in
dry
clothes
was
pronounced
by
all
to
be
none
the
worse
for
her
thrilling
experience
dolly
however
was
exhausted
rose
after
leaving
the
baby
to
the
nurse
hurried
dolly
home
and
put
her
to
bed
yes
my
dear
she
said
as
dolly
objected
you
have
an
ordeal
to
go
through
with
as
heroine
of
this
occasion
when
norris
comes
home
she
will
come
over
here
to
give
you
a
medal
for
bravery
and
heroism
and
general
attributes
so
you
must
go
to
bed
now
and
get
rested
up
to
receive
her
thanks
you
going
to
have
a
cup
of
hot
broth
and
a
good
rest
and
perhaps
a
nap
and
you
wake
up
just
as
bright
and
happy
as
ever
and
rose
treatment
was
just
what
dolly
needed
she
slept
an
hour
or
more
and
then
awoke
to
find
dotty
black
eyes
gazing
into
her
own
you
beautiful
splendid
dollyrinda
she
exclaimed
you
a
red
cross
heroine
and
a
legion
of
honour
girl
and
i
do
know
what
all
nonsense
dot
i
did
do
any
more
than
you
did
if
you
had
had
the
gumption
to
run
and
get
your
father
gladys
would
well
things
would
have
been
different
it
was
all
my
fault
though
and
the
tears
came
into
dotty
eyes
i
did
the
wrong
in
putting
the
baby
in
the
canoe
in
the
first
place
i
did
that
just
as
much
as
you
did
we
both
did
wrong
there
i
expect
and
we
both
did
wrong
in
scrabbling
over
the
rope
oh
we
did
wrong
all
right
but
neither
of
us
was
worse
than
the
other
what
will
norris
say
to
us
she
here
now
said
dotty
waiting
for
you
to
come
down
she
blame
us
she
blames
sarah
for
going
away
and
leaving
the
baby
that
is
fair
and
dolly
sprang
out
of
bed
we
told
sarah
she
could
go
tie
up
my
hair
please
dotty
i
want
to
go
down
and
tell
norris
all
about
it
but
as
it
turned
out
norris
was
so
glad
and
happy
that
little
gladys
was
safe
that
she
would
allow
the
two
d
to
be
blamed
at
all
and
as
the
girls
besought
her
not
to
blame
the
nurse
for
what
had
really
been
their
doing
they
all
agreed
to
ignore
the
question
of
blame
and
dwell
only
on
their
gladness
and
happiness
at
the
safety
of
everybody
concerned
chapter
xii
who
was
the
tall
phantom
what
a
phantom
party
asked
dolly
oh
it
lots
of
fun
dotty
replied
everybody
is
rigged
up
in
sheets
with
a
made
of
a
and
a
little
white
mask
over
your
face
so
nobody
knows
you
can
i
go
asked
genie
her
black
eyes
dancing
no
said
her
mother
you
too
young
dearie
this
party
of
edith
holmes
is
an
evening
party
it
begins
at
seven
and
only
the
big
girls
can
go
to
it
oh
dear
will
i
ever
get
grown
up
and
genie
sighed
with
envy
of
her
sister
and
dolly
but
how
do
you
know
who
anybody
is
went
on
dolly
who
had
never
heard
of
this
game
before
you
do
that
the
fun
of
it
you
ca
tell
the
girls
from
the
boys
and
you
must
try
to
make
your
voice
different
so
nobody
will
know
who
you
are
have
you
plenty
of
sheets
mother
to
fix
us
up
yes
indeed
one
apiece
will
do
you
i
think
if
they
are
wide
ones
we
make
our
own
masks
said
dotty
who
had
attended
parties
of
this
sort
before
so
they
cut
masks
from
white
muslin
with
a
little
frill
across
the
bottom
and
holes
to
fit
their
eyes
now
we
must
put
a
piece
of
gauze
or
net
behind
these
said
dotty
out
of
her
full
experience
for
if
we
do
they
know
your
eyes
and
mine
in
a
minute
dollyrinda
then
how
can
we
see
where
we
going
oh
we
can
see
through
the
thin
stuff
easily
enough
but
our
eyes
show
plainly
to
other
people
so
insets
of
fine
white
net
were
put
in
the
and
the
dainty
white
masks
were
really
pretty
affairs
they
had
made
them
not
exactly
alike
lest
duplicates
should
lead
to
suspicion
of
their
identity
when
it
was
time
to
get
ready
for
the
party
rose
pinned
the
girls
into
their
sheet
draperies
make
us
as
different
as
possible
mother
advised
dotty
so
never
think
we
us
rose
pinned
dolly
sheet
into
the
semblance
of
a
japanese
kimono
while
she
arranged
dotty
in
full
folds
round
the
neck
and
let
it
hang
in
a
mother
hubbard
effect
dolly
headdress
was
bunched
on
either
side
of
her
head
like
rosettes
over
her
ears
and
dotty
hung
in
a
plain
flat
fold
down
her
back
like
an
italian
girl
the
masks
were
adjusted
and
the
girls
were
ready
to
start
they
wore
white
gloves
and
white
shoes
and
looked
like
a
pair
of
very
lively
ghosts
rose
escorted
them
over
to
the
holmes
camp
or
nearly
there
for
it
was
the
plan
that
each
phantom
must
sneak
in
as
stealthily
as
possible
in
order
to
remain
unknown
so
sometime
before
they
reached
their
destination
dotty
ran
on
ahead
and
with
great
manoeuvring
managed
to
slip
in
unseen
and
saunter
among
the
crowd
already
gathered
silently
among
the
trees
rose
led
dolly
until
he
saw
a
good
opportunity
and
then
with
a
whispered
scoot
in
there
he
indicated
a
chance
for
her
to
make
her
entrance
and
he
himself
went
back
home
it
was
dusk
not
dark
but
the
light
of
the
big
camp
fire
made
convenient
shadows
to
screen
the
entrance
of
the
guests
it
seemed
a
weird
sight
to
dolly
as
she
somewhat
timidly
made
her
way
in
twenty
or
thirty
figures
were
bowing
and
scraping
or
dancing
wildly
about
or
talking
to
each
other
in
high
squeaky
voices
and
short
sentences
know
me
somebody
said
stopping
in
front
of
dolly
the
voice
seemed
a
little
familiar
and
yet
dolly
could
quite
place
it
it
might
be
jack
norris
or
it
might
be
one
of
the
holmes
boys
but
in
a
spirit
of
fun
she
nodded
her
head
affirmatively
with
great
vigour
as
if
to
declare
that
she
knew
the
speaker
perfectly
well
but
she
would
not
speak
herself
who
squeaked
the
high
voice
hoping
dolly
would
speak
and
thus
reveal
her
own
identity
but
dolly
was
too
canny
for
this
instead
she
joined
together
her
thumb
and
forefinger
of
each
hand
and
held
them
up
to
her
eyes
making
circles
like
rims
now
in
sunny
weather
guy
holmes
wore
big
glasses
with
shell
rims
and
as
this
described
him
fairly
well
it
was
a
stroke
of
triumph
on
dolly
part
for
it
was
guy
holmes
himself
and
he
doubled
up
with
laughter
at
the
clever
identification
but
he
shook
his
head
as
if
dolly
were
greatly
mistaken
in
her
guess
and
so
she
did
know
whether
she
had
been
right
or
not
when
all
had
arrived
they
danced
in
a
circle
round
the
fire
chanting
wild
sounds
that
had
no
meaning
or
rhythm
but
were
supposed
to
be
ghostlike
wails
and
groans
then
a
game
was
played
under
the
direction
of
holmes
by
which
it
was
endeavoured
to
learn
who
the
different
phantoms
were
their
host
led
them
to
what
was
really
the
for
the
family
laundry
a
clothesline
stretched
on
four
posts
formed
a
square
and
from
the
clothesline
depended
brown
paper
bags
of
varying
sizes
from
large
to
tiny
each
held
by
a
slender
string
one
at
a
time
holmes
explained
our
ghostly
friends
will
go
into
the
square
and
being
blindfolded
will
endeavour
to
hit
a
bag
with
a
stick
if
the
attempt
is
successful
the
ghost
may
return
unchallenged
but
if
he
fail
to
hit
a
bag
the
others
may
guess
from
his
gestures
who
it
is
the
bags
were
not
very
near
together
there
being
only
three
or
four
on
each
side
of
the
clothesline
square
holmes
selected
one
of
the
phantoms
and
escorted
it
to
the
middle
of
the
square
placed
a
stick
in
the
outstretched
hand
blindfolded
the
motionless
figure
turned
it
round
with
a
whirl
and
said
step
forward
and
hit
where
you
choose
and
see
if
you
can
bring
down
a
bag
the
ghost
was
very
evidently
a
boy
for
two
vigorous
arms
grasped
the
stick
and
with
a
couple
of
long
strides
the
white
figure
stalked
forward
a
vigorous
blow
ensued
but
the
stick
came
down
between
two
of
the
bags
and
made
no
hit
now
you
may
guess
who
it
is
said
holmes
as
our
friend
ghost
did
not
strike
anything
if
you
guess
right
he
must
take
off
his
mask
but
if
not
he
may
retain
it
only
one
guess
allowed
somebody
sung
out
the
name
of
jack
norris
as
the
ghost
was
about
his
height
but
the
white
figure
shook
its
head
vigorously
and
glided
back
among
the
crowd
the
game
went
on
sometimes
a
ghost
would
hit
a
bag
and
the
flimsy
paper
would
burst
and
a
quantity
of
peanuts
or
popcorn
would
scatter
on
the
grass
to
be
scrabbled
for
by
the
rollicking
phantoms
one
bag
held
confetti
which
scattered
through
the
air
in
a
gay
shower
of
colour
when
it
was
dolly
turn
she
was
determined
that
she
would
act
as
differently
as
possible
from
her
usual
manner
and
so
fool
everybody
after
she
was
blindfolded
and
turned
round
she
took
the
stick
and
with
little
mincing
steps
imitated
exactly
the
gait
of
josie
holmes
she
made
a
wild
dash
with
the
stick
but
failed
to
hit
a
bag
and
maisie
norris
called
out
at
once
you
josie
holmes
i
know
that
walk
dolly
shook
her
head
vigorously
and
ran
back
to
the
crowd
she
chanced
to
stand
next
to
a
very
tall
ghost
who
gravely
patted
her
cheek
as
she
stood
beside
him
dolly
looked
up
quickly
for
she
did
not
like
this
familiarity
from
a
stranger
and
she
was
sure
the
phantom
was
too
tall
to
be
any
of
the
boys
she
knew
of
course
as
the
party
was
large
there
were
many
of
the
guests
whom
dolly
had
never
met
and
she
resented
the
act
of
the
stranger
and
drawing
herself
up
with
great
dignity
turned
her
back
upon
him
but
the
tall
ghost
jumped
around
in
front
of
her
and
patted
her
other
cheek
the
while
he
gave
a
cackling
rattling
ghostly
chuckle
to
be
sure
dolly
cheek
was
covered
by
her
mask
and
the
ghost
wore
white
cotton
gloves
but
she
did
not
at
all
like
his
familiar
manner
and
she
walked
quickly
away
from
him
a
few
moments
later
the
tall
ghost
himself
went
to
take
his
turn
with
the
stick
blindfolded
and
whirled
about
he
went
with
short
steady
steps
straight
forward
and
with
a
big
whack
he
chanced
to
bring
down
a
good
sized
bag
it
was
filled
with
the
feathers
of
a
whole
pillow
and
great
laughter
ensued
as
like
snowflakes
the
feathers
flew
through
the
air
his
heavy
stroke
had
sent
the
bag
flying
upward
and
as
it
burst
the
feathers
descended
in
a
shower
since
he
had
broken
a
bag
the
identity
of
the
tall
ghost
was
not
even
guessed
at
so
dolly
had
no
chance
to
learn
his
name
however
everybody
was
laughing
and
sneezing
as
the
feathers
drifted
down
and
flew
into
their
mouths
or
tickled
their
ears
only
a
few
of
the
ghosts
names
were
guessed
correctly
as
many
of
them
had
carefully
disguised
their
shapes
and
sizes
thin
people
had
put
on
sweaters
or
bulky
coats
to
make
themselves
appear
stout
and
short
people
had
built
up
high
headdresses
in
an
effort
to
seem
taller
by
the
time
the
game
was
over
every
one
was
in
most
hilarious
mood
and
the
few
who
had
been
guessed
and
so
had
removed
their
masks
were
teasing
the
others
in
efforts
to
make
them
talk
i
know
you
said
elmer
holmes
pausing
in
front
of
dolly
dotty
rose
how
do
you
know
and
dolly
spoke
in
low
guttural
tones
way
down
in
her
throat
oh
you
need
growl
like
a
little
bear
cub
i
know
you
because
you
so
careful
of
that
left
wing
of
yours
you
thought
nobody
would
notice
it
did
you
but
i
spied
it
and
i
you
dot
you
got
on
a
couple
of
coats
or
something
to
make
you
look
fatter
but
dotty
all
right
dolly
shook
with
laughter
for
she
had
pretended
to
shield
her
left
arm
with
a
gesture
that
was
purposely
copied
from
dotty
just
then
the
tall
ghost
appeared
again
at
dolly
side
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
bent
down
a
little
to
look
in
her
eyes
dolly
drew
away
from
him
and
turned
to
elmer
holmes
who
she
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper
pointing
to
the
tall
phantom
that
telling
said
elmer
laughing
ask
him
yourself
who
he
is
who
grunted
dolly
again
addressing
herself
to
the
tall
one
peter
peter
and
the
tall
ghost
grunted
out
the
words
from
one
corner
of
his
mouth
and
dolly
could
not
recognise
the
voice
as
the
ghost
spoke
he
patted
dolly
on
the
head
dolly
disliked
his
manner
for
none
of
the
other
boys
were
other
than
correctly
formal
and
polite
so
she
turned
away
from
him
making
a
gesture
of
dismissal
with
her
hand
apparently
peter
peter
was
desolated
for
he
put
his
hands
to
his
eyes
and
rocked
himself
back
and
forth
with
wailing
groans
of
despair
he
was
funny
and
dolly
had
a
great
desire
to
know
who
he
might
be
but
she
did
not
like
the
familiarity
of
his
manner
and
she
turned
away
to
speak
to
some
one
else
take
partners
for
a
virginia
reel
called
out
holmes
and
after
that
we
will
unmask
for
supper
the
next
moment
dolly
found
the
tall
ghost
bowing
before
her
and
evidently
asking
her
to
dance
with
him
but
instinctively
she
felt
that
she
preferred
not
to
dance
with
a
partner
who
was
what
she
called
fresh
in
his
manner
and
she
shook
her
head
in
refusal
peter
urged
and
begged
her
in
dumb
show
to
consent
dolly
was
tempted
to
do
so
for
his
gestures
were
pleasantly
wheedlesome
but
as
she
held
out
her
hand
in
half
consent
peter
grasped
it
and
falling
on
one
knee
kissed
it
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
with
all
the
effect
of
a
most
devoted
cavalier
he
too
silly
dolly
thought
to
herself
i
wo
dance
with
him
for
i
do
know
how
he
would
carry
on
but
i
wonder
who
he
is
so
dolly
turned
decidedly
away
from
the
tall
suitor
and
found
two
other
ghosts
bowing
before
her
and
evidently
requesting
her
to
dance
she
looked
at
the
two
figures
and
having
no
idea
who
they
might
be
she
hesitated
which
to
choose
finally
with
a
finger
she
touched
each
in
turn
counting
out
my
mother
told
me
to
take
this
one
she
mumbled
in
a
monotonous
singsong
tone
and
then
as
her
final
choice
rested
on
one
of
the
ghosts
she
went
away
with
him
to
take
her
place
in
the
lines
that
were
forming
for
the
dance
dolly
was
at
the
end
of
the
line
of
girls
and
opposite
her
of
course
was
her
partner
next
to
dolly
partner
stood
the
tall
ghost
and
as
dolly
looked
at
him
he
waved
his
hand
at
her
and
then
lightly
blew
her
a
kiss
from
the
tips
of
his
fingers
freshy
said
dolly
to
herself
i
think
he
horrid
to
act
like
that
when
he
does
know
me
at
all
for
i
know
i
not
met
any
boy
up
here
as
tall
as
he
is
the
dance
began
and
there
was
much
gay
laughter
as
the
phantoms
advanced
and
retreated
in
their
respective
turns
the
boys
pranced
awkwardly
in
their
unaccustomed
draperies
while
the
girls
minced
around
prettily
and
flung
their
sheets
in
graceful
whirls
when
it
came
dolly
turn
she
suddenly
realised
that
as
the
tall
ghost
stood
next
to
her
own
partner
it
was
the
obnoxious
peter
with
whom
she
would
have
to
go
through
the
figures
of
the
dance
with
a
very
stately
air
she
went
forward
as
the
tall
ghost
came
to
meet
her
they
bowed
with
great
dignity
and
turned
to
their
places
while
the
other
couple
did
their
part
next
they
must
join
right
hands
and
swing
around
and
this
time
the
tall
ghost
whirled
dolly
around
so
vigorously
that
he
almost
swung
her
off
her
feet
dolly
began
to
be
really
annoyed
but
she
determined
not
to
show
it
and
stepped
gracefully
up
for
the
next
figure
this
was
the
left
hand
twirl
and
peter
turned
her
around
more
gently
this
time
but
the
next
when
they
joined
both
hands
peter
swung
her
swiftly
round
twice
instead
of
once
his
own
feet
clumping
as
if
in
a
clog
dance
the
next
time
the
pair
merely
walked
round
each
other
back
to
back
and
dolly
was
very
careful
to
keep
as
far
distant
as
possible
from
the
obnoxious
peter
the
dance
would
soon
be
over
she
knew
and
then
he
would
have
to
unmask
and
she
could
see
who
this
unpleasantly
forward
youth
might
be
it
was
during
the
last
of
the
grand
march
when
it
came
dolly
turn
to
dance
gaily
down
the
line
with
her
own
partner
whom
she
did
not
yet
know
by
name
that
peter
unceremoniously
pushed
dolly
partner
aside
and
himself
taking
dolly
hand
whirled
her
down
the
long
aisle
between
the
two
lines
of
ghosts
who
clapped
their
hands
and
chanted
or
whistled
in
time
to
the
music
so
rapidly
did
peter
whirl
dolly
around
that
she
had
no
choice
but
to
follow
and
she
realised
suddenly
that
the
tall
ghost
was
a
most
awkward
dancer
and
that
unless
she
was
very
nimble
herself
he
would
tread
on
her
toes
too
angry
now
to
think
of
disguising
her
voice
dolly
whispered
to
peter
as
they
danced
along
you
are
most
rude
and
unmannerly
i
have
never
met
a
boy
so
fresh
and
horrid
as
soon
as
we
reach
the
other
end
of
the
line
i
command
you
to
let
me
go
and
i
wish
you
never
to
speak
to
me
again
dolly
was
thoroughly
angry
but
as
she
preferred
not
to
let
the
others
know
of
her
annoyance
she
danced
on
with
peter
toward
the
end
of
the
line
though
she
suddenly
realised
that
he
was
guiding
her
so
as
to
make
their
progress
as
slow
as
possible
oh
now
oh
now
do
get
mad
and
the
squeaky
voiced
choked
with
laughter
was
almost
inaudible
i
mad
i
you
you
not
a
nice
boy
at
all
and
i
wonder
edith
holmes
invited
you
she
did
was
squeaked
into
dolly
ear
and
then
as
they
reached
the
end
of
the
line
the
audacious
peter
lifted
the
frill
of
dolly
mask
and
kissed
her
cheek
then
with
a
bow
he
released
her
and
turned
away
to
his
place
in
the
line
but
as
peter
had
taken
the
place
of
dolly
partner
and
as
her
partner
had
apparently
not
resented
this
act
dolly
had
no
choice
but
to
join
hands
with
peter
and
march
back
under
an
formed
by
the
clasped
hands
of
the
other
ghosts
rather
than
make
an
unpleasant
scene
by
refusing
dolly
thought
better
to
do
this
as
it
would
end
the
dance
so
giving
her
to
the
horrid
peter
she
bent
to
go
under
the
raised
hands
tall
peter
had
to
bend
a
great
deal
and
as
for
some
reason
or
other
he
was
decidedly
clumsy
with
his
feet
and
forever
tripping
on
his
trailing
robe
the
pair
could
think
of
nothing
but
their
progress
along
the
line
and
as
they
reached
the
end
the
dance
was
over
and
the
music
stopped
now
thought
dolly
to
herself
i
see
who
that
horrid
boy
is
though
of
course
it
no
one
i
know
and
as
he
said
edith
did
invite
him
he
must
be
some
intruder
who
has
any
business
here
but
i
see
why
he
picked
out
to
annoy
with
his
bad
manners
i
hope
nobody
saw
him
masks
off
sang
out
holmes
and
each
ghost
began
to
untie
the
strings
of
his
concealing
disguise
it
was
not
always
easy
and
many
had
to
ask
help
from
their
neighbours
before
they
could
release
themselves
dolly
untied
her
mask
quickly
and
stood
with
angry
eyes
awaiting
a
revelation
of
peter
identity
with
one
hand
behind
his
head
as
he
loosened
his
mask
the
tall
ghost
stepped
to
dolly
side
and
said
in
a
squeaky
whisper
wo
you
forgive
me
no
said
dolly
sternly
as
she
frowned
at
him
you
have
been
unpardonable
and
i
have
no
wish
to
know
you
aw
now
dollydoodle
and
the
mask
was
whisked
off
and
smiling
down
at
her
stood
dolly
brother
bert
dolly
stared
at
him
in
utter
amazement
and
then
burst
into
laughter
as
she
realised
what
it
all
meant
you
goose
she
exclaimed
as
the
brother
and
sister
stood
choking
with
laughter
at
the
situation
but
how
i
know
you
said
dolly
what
makes
you
so
tall
i
have
big
blocks
of
wood
fastened
to
my
shoe
soles
explained
bert
and
my
but
it
makes
me
i
should
think
so
i
do
see
how
you
danced
at
all
where
you
come
from
how
did
you
get
here
oh
bert
i
so
glad
it
was
for
i
was
so
mad
when
i
thought
some
stranger
was
acting
up
like
that
it
was
a
shame
dollypops
to
tease
you
but
i
just
could
help
it
i
had
no
intention
of
acting
up
like
that
but
when
i
just
patted
your
hand
you
got
so
mad
that
i
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
go
on
i
glad
you
such
a
little
well
i
should
hope
i
want
strange
boys
patting
me
like
that
and
when
you
kissed
me
bert
i
thought
i
should
scream
i
was
so
mad
but
honestly
i
was
ashamed
to
make
a
scene
and
let
people
know
what
you
had
done
you
forgive
me
sister
wo
you
and
bert
big
blue
eyes
looked
into
dolly
as
for
a
moment
he
did
feel
ashamed
of
himself
for
teasing
her
so
but
his
love
of
a
joke
was
so
great
that
he
had
thoroughly
enjoyed
fooling
dolly
and
his
affectionate
sister
willingly
forgave
him
do
know
yet
who
was
your
partner
do
you
dolly
said
a
voice
near
her
and
turning
dolly
saw
bob
rose
oh
were
and
dolly
turned
to
him
laughing
i
sure
was
i
resigned
in
favour
of
bert
at
the
last
because
he
commanded
me
to
when
did
you
come
up
here
and
the
amazed
dolly
began
to
realise
how
matters
stood
said
bert
we
were
at
crosstrees
before
you
girls
left
but
rose
kept
us
hidden
and
after
you
were
gone
she
togged
us
up
in
sheets
and
here
we
are
but
why
did
you
make
yourself
tall
bert
nobody
up
here
would
know
you
anyhow
except
dot
and
me
oh
just
did
it
for
fun
thought
i
make
an
impression
as
the
tallest
ghost
in
captivity
where
dotty
and
i
want
to
meet
a
few
of
these
other
ghost
girls
i
shake
you
now
dollikins
and
you
can
have
your
own
partner
back
bert
went
away
leaving
bob
with
dolly
who
escorted
her
to
supper
the
supper
was
served
in
true
fashion
there
was
no
table
the
ghosts
all
unmasked
now
sat
round
the
big
fire
on
camp
stools
or
cushions
and
the
boys
waited
on
the
girls
in
true
picnic
style
there
were
substantial
viands
as
the
evening
air
caused
hearty
appetites
and
dolly
settled
herself
comfortably
on
a
divan
improvised
of
evergreen
boughs
and
gratefully
accepted
a
cup
of
hot
bouillon
and
some
sandwiches
that
bob
brought
edith
holmes
was
sitting
by
dolly
and
she
was
chuckling
with
laughter
as
bert
told
her
the
joke
he
had
played
on
his
sister
after
supper
the
merry
young
people
sang
songs
and
glees
round
the
fire
until
it
was
time
to
go
home
daddy
said
he
come
for
us
said
dotty
laughingly
to
dolly
but
of
course
he
did
mean
it
for
he
knew
the
boys
would
be
here
to
take
us
home
i
just
remove
these
blocks
of
wood
before
i
start
said
bert
as
he
quickly
tore
off
the
clumsy
and
cumbersome
things
now
i
can
walk
better
and
he
stood
on
his
own
shoe
soles
and
at
his
own
height
i
awfully
glad
you
here
again
bob
said
edith
holmes
as
they
said
and
i
glad
you
here
too
she
added
to
bert
fayre
our
camps
are
so
near
that
we
must
play
together
a
lot
nice
girl
commented
bert
as
the
quartette
walked
away
lots
of
nice
people
at
that
party
yes
agreed
bob
girls
are
nice
at
parties
but
sometimes
we
want
them
around
be
sure
to
be
up
old
man
by
sunrise
morning
for
we
going
fishing
early
ca
we
go
asked
dotty
no
no
girls
need
apply
a
real
fishing
trip
is
a
serious
matter
and
we
ca
be
bothered
with
girls
when
we
come
home
night
if
mother
says
you
been
good
children
all
day
you
can
have
some
of
our
fish
chapter
xiii
that
luncheon
to
dolly
surprise
she
discovered
that
bob
and
bert
were
in
earnest
regarding
their
preference
for
expeditions
that
did
not
include
girls
nearly
every
day
the
two
boys
went
off
fishing
or
motor
boating
with
a
lot
of
their
cronies
but
the
girls
were
seldom
asked
they
always
like
that
said
dotty
carelessly
they
like
to
ramble
through
the
woods
or
cruise
around
the
lake
by
themselves
they
wear
old
flannel
shirts
and
disreputable
hats
and
they
eat
their
lunch
any
old
way
without
any
frills
or
fuss
i
do
like
that
sort
of
picnicking
myself
i
like
pretty
table
fixings
even
if
they
only
paper
napkins
and
pasteboard
dishes
but
the
boys
like
tin
pails
and
old
frying
pans
and
they
catch
their
fish
and
cook
and
eat
like
a
horde
of
savages
all
right
agreed
dolly
we
can
have
fun
enough
without
them
but
i
think
they
might
take
us
along
sometimes
let
get
up
a
rival
picnic
some
day
and
see
if
they
wo
come
to
it
they
wo
said
dotty
but
we
can
try
it
if
you
like
and
anyway
we
can
have
our
own
fun
so
one
day
when
all
the
boys
of
the
neighbouring
camps
were
going
on
a
fishing
trip
the
girls
arranged
a
picnic
of
their
own
the
two
holmes
girls
maisie
norris
dolly
and
dotty
and
three
or
four
others
were
in
the
crowd
and
they
were
to
go
in
two
motor
boats
to
bramble
brook
the
very
spot
where
the
boys
were
trout
fishing
that
day
long
sam
navigated
one
boat
and
the
norris
man
engineered
the
other
dolly
had
evolved
a
plan
for
a
great
joke
on
the
boys
which
she
flattered
herself
would
even
up
with
bert
for
the
joke
he
had
played
on
her
in
pursuance
of
their
plan
the
girls
were
taking
with
them
a
most
marvellous
luncheon
there
were
boxes
of
devilled
eggs
each
gold
and
white
confection
in
a
case
of
fringed
white
paper
sandwiches
in
tiny
rolls
and
fancy
shapes
dishes
of
salad
that
were
pictures
in
themselves
and
platters
of
cold
meats
cut
in
appetising
slices
and
garnished
with
aspic
jelly
in
quivering
translucence
platters
of
cold
chicken
delicately
browned
and
garnished
with
parsley
and
lemon
slices
dainty
baskets
of
little
frosted
cakes
and
tartlets
filled
with
tempting
jam
covered
with
frosting
oh
dolly
had
planned
well
for
her
little
joke
and
if
successful
it
would
be
rare
sport
the
boys
had
been
gone
for
hours
when
the
girls
started
and
in
their
fresh
linen
dresses
and
bright
they
were
a
jolly
looking
crowd
who
filled
the
two
motor
boats
as
they
left
the
crosstrees
pier
rose
waved
a
knowing
the
young
people
were
safe
in
charge
of
long
sam
and
old
ephraim
the
tried
and
trusted
factotum
of
the
norris
family
in
you
go
cried
long
sam
as
he
deftly
handed
the
girls
into
the
boats
and
the
laughing
crowd
settled
themselves
to
enjoy
the
trip
it
was
a
beautiful
day
and
the
heat
sufficiently
tempered
by
the
cool
breezes
that
swept
across
the
lake
the
girls
chattered
and
sang
and
called
to
each
other
as
the
two
boats
kept
close
together
on
their
way
when
they
reached
bramble
brook
they
did
not
go
to
the
regular
landing
place
but
long
sam
cleverly
found
a
concealed
nook
where
they
could
land
without
danger
of
being
seen
by
the
boys
who
were
already
there
the
trout
stream
was
a
long
one
but
all
of
its
meanderings
were
well
known
to
sam
and
ephraim
who
were
old
residents
of
the
locality
the
girls
waited
while
the
two
men
went
to
reconnoitre
after
a
time
the
scouts
returned
they
away
up
the
brook
said
long
sam
but
all
their
grub
and
things
is
stacked
in
the
clearing
and
i
reckon
they
be
coming
along
back
in
about
an
hour
to
feed
they
started
pretty
early
and
i
reckon
they
ca
hold
out
much
longer
their
grub
what
next
ladies
you
sam
help
us
unpack
our
hampers
said
dolly
who
was
directing
affairs
and
you
ephraim
go
and
gather
up
all
their
foodstuff
and
either
hide
it
around
there
or
bring
it
back
here
yes
and
old
ephraim
trudged
away
intent
only
on
obeying
orders
to
the
letter
he
returned
with
a
big
basket
on
either
arm
thought
i
better
fetch
it
along
he
said
them
chaps
would
hunt
it
out
wherever
i
hid
it
i
left
all
their
cooking
things
pots
and
pans
but
poor
fellers
they
wo
have
nothin

cried
edith
holmes
who
was
peering
into
the
baskets
and
here

and
eggs
oh

horrid
looking
stuff
and
loaves
of
dry
bread
guy
and
elmer
just

said
dotty
there
nothing
so
good
at
a
camp
feast
as
coffee
do
you
love
it
edith
mother
does
let
me
have
it
but
make
it
all
the
same
the
boys

said
dotty
mother

that
but
i
going
to
make
it
the
boys
will
be
crazy
about
it
you
scoot
back
and
get
the
coffee
pot
ephraim
and
the
big
long
spoon
they
probably
have
one
back
went
ephraim
on
his
errand
and
when
he
returned
his
eyes
were
greeted
by
the
sight
of
the
daintily
spread
luncheon
heavy
brown
papers
had
been
spread
on
the
ground
and
these
were
covered
with
a
tablecloth
of
white
crepe
paper
with
a
design
of
green
ferns
for
a
border
real
ferns
were
laid
here
and
there
under
the
dishes
of
good
things
and
piles
of
white
pasteboard
plates
and
paper
napkins
were
in
readiness
what
about
coffee
cups
exclaimed
maisie
i
know
they
only
have
horrid
old
tin
things
oh
we
lots
of
paper
drinking
cups
said
dotty
those
pretty
pleated
ones
they
be
lovely
for
coffee
say
sam
i
want
this
coffee
to
be
just
right
and
i
wish
you
make
it
i
know
how
but
i
sure
yours
will
be
better
long
sam
was
greatly
flattered
at
this
compliment
and
he
proceeded
to
build
a
fire
and
make
the
coffee
with
a
practised
hand
that
betokened
long
experience
in
these
arts
is
the
table
lovely
exclaimed
josie
holmes
as
she
brought
a
few
wild
flowers
she
had
found
and
placed
them
gracefully
among
the
ferns
that
decorated
the
feast
and
thank
goodness
i
have
seen
a
spider
nor
an
ant
cried
nellie
north
who
had
been
with
another
girl
told
off
to
keep
the
table
free
of
any
such
marauders
one
venturesome
grasshopper
had
made
a
spring
toward
the
food
but
had
been
caught
and
had
his
energies
turned
in
a
far
different
direction
we
have
to
wait
an
awful
long
time
said
edith
as
she
looked
longingly
at
the
tempting
dishes
never
mind
if
we
do
said
dotty
there
nothing
that
can
take
any
hurt
there
nothing
to
get
cold
except
the
coffee
and
sam
will
attend
to
that
the
glass
fruit
jars
full
of
lemonade
are
in
the
brook
so
that
will
be
lovely
and
cool
when
we
want
it
oh
everything
is
all
right
and
we
only
just
got
to
wait
so
you
girls
may
as
well
make
up
your
mind
to
it
although
the
wait
seemed
long
after
a
time
long
sam
scouting
about
heard
the
boys
voices
in
the
distance
he
warned
the
girls
and
they
were
all
quiet
as
mice
awaiting
developments
the
crowd
of
boys
came
nearer
laughing
and
shouting
as
they
reached
their
own
headquarters
sam
beckoned
to
the
girls
to
come
and
peep
through
the
bushes
at
the
amazed
group
who
had
suddenly
discovered
that
their
food
was
missing
somebody
has
swiped
it
cried
elmer
holmes
angrily
all
our
grub
is
gone
i
say
fellows
what
shall
we
do
do
go
after
them
and
get
it
back
cried
jack
norris
and
then
a
chorus
of
shouts
went
up
the
coffee
pot
gone
all
the
bacon
and
eggs
are
gone
and
the
bread
too
they
sure
made
a
clean
sweep
said
bert
fayre
who
do
you
did
it
some
other
crowd
of
fishing
chaps
said
bob
rose
confidently
but
it
does
often
happen
a
thing
like
that
no
decent
fellows
would
do
it
the
girls
only
a
few
rods
distant
were
peeping
through
the
bushes
and
shaking
with
silent
laughter
at
the
discomfited
boys
such
looks
of
chagrin
and
dismay
as
they
showed
and
such
belligerent
determination
to
hunt
the
marauders
and
duly
punish
them
just
you
wait
till
i
get
hold
of
the
thieves
cried
elmer
holmes
i
give
them
what
for
you
wo
catch
them
said
bert
they
probably
miles
away
by
this
time
and
they
probably
eaten
up
all
our
snacks
wow
but
hungry
so
say
we
all
of
us
chorused
the
boys
as
they
flung
themselves
around
in
disconsolate
attitudes
not
a
of
anything
jack
went
on
peering
vainly
into
a
few
empty
baskets
that
sam
had
left
behind
him
the
nerve
of
them
to
steal
our
coffee
and
then
take
our
coffee
pot
to
make
it
in
honest
fellows
i
never
knew
such
a
thing
to
happen
before
i
been
up
here
a
lot
of
summers
and
i
never
struck
a
crowd
that
would
do
such
a
thing
as
this
that
so
agreed
bob
rose
why
often
a
lot
of
strange
chaps
will
share
their
grub
with
you
but
i
never
knew
to
hook
it
must
be
an
awful
mean
crowd
well
all
the
same
said
bert
what
are
we
going
to
do
for
lunch
i
rousted
out
at
sunup
and
to
be
sure
i
had
my
breakfast
but
forgotten
in
the
dim
past
we
can
cook
our
fish
said
one
of
the
boys
but
we
miss
the
coffee
and
potatoes
and
bread
and
such
various
staffs
of
life
we
have
such
a
lot
of
fish
anyhow
no
we
depended
on
bacon
and
eggs
for
our
mainstay
i
move
we
go
home
we
have
to
and
bob
looked
rueful
we
ca
put
in
a
whole
afternoon
on
empty
stomachs
what
do
you
say
shall
we
cook
the
fish
or
light
right
out
for
home
here
a
cracker
they
dropped
cried
bert
who
spied
a
soda
biscuit
on
the
ground
and
brushing
it
off
began
to
eat
it
aw
give
a
starving
comrade
a
bite
and
guy
held
out
his
hand
eagerly
by
jiminy
here
another
and
jack
found
another
cracker
farther
along
now
this
was
part
of
the
plan
and
it
was
at
dolly
directions
that
long
sam
had
carefully
planted
a
few
crackers
at
intervals
to
lure
the
unsuspecting
boys
to
the
surprise
that
awaited
them
dolly
and
dotty
with
their
arms
around
each
other
were
peeping
through
the
trees
and
they
shook
with
glee
as
they
saw
the
boys
eagerly
hunting
for
the
stray
crackers
funny
how
they
came
to
drop
along
said
guy
and
elmer
responded
must
have
been
eating
them
on
their
way
but
say
they
left
a
trail
let
follow
it
the
group
of
boys
there
were
eight
of
them
moved
slowly
along
toward
where
the
girls
were
hidden
the
trail
of
crackers
had
been
adroitly
arranged
to
bring
them
finally
within
sight
of
the
appetising
luncheon
so
daintily
set
forth
as
the
boys
came
nearer
to
the
little
clearing
and
as
the
sight
of
the
feast
must
in
a
moment
burst
upon
their
eyes
the
girls
scampered
to
hide
behind
trees
to
watch
the
astonished
faces
nor
were
they
disappointed
in
a
moment
more
the
boys
came
in
sight
of
the
luncheon
and
stopped
suddenly
by
gum
well
what
do
you
know
about
that
jiminy
crickets
ah
there
my
size
and
various
other
boyish
exclamations
gave
voice
to
surprise
and
delight
on
the
part
of
the
onlookers
but
they
paused
several
steps
away
from
the
feast
that
a
girls
layout
said
bert
fayre
nodding
his
head
sagaciously
no
fellows
ever
set
up
that
dinky
business
but
it
looks
good
to
me
good
exclaimed
jack
i
face
a
term
in
state
prison
to
nab
that
loot
wonder
who
owns
it
certainly
not
the
people
who
stole
our
grub
so
we
ca
claim
this
in
return
oh
i
smell
coffee
unwilling
to
intrude
further
on
what
was
so
evidently
a
girls
picnic
and
yet
equally
unable
to
tear
themselves
away
from
the
enticing
scene
the
boys
stood
a
comically
eager
crowd
looking
vainly
about
for
signs
of
the
picnic
party
seems
i
must
grab
one
sandwich
said
bob
rolling
his
eyes
comically
toward
the
dishes
well
you
wo
said
bert
who
had
no
fear
that
bob
would
be
guilty
of
such
a
thing
but
he
was
quite
so
sure
of
some
of
the
other
boys
and
so
they
stood
like
a
lot
of
hungry
tramps
a
little
bewildered
at
the
situation
and
greatly
tantalised
by
the
sight
of
the
feast
and
the
odour
of
steaming
coffee
nothing
doing
said
bob
at
last
we
ca
touch
other
property
and
we
might
as
well
go
on
home
but
if
the
ladies
belonging
to
this
church
sociable
would
show
themselves
i
sit
up
and
beg
for
a
bone
of
that
fried
chicken
over
there
maybe
we
all
would
commented
several
and
then
at
a
signal
from
dolly
the
girls
sprang
from
their
and
stood
laughing
at
the
crowd
of
hungry
boys
oh
you
dotty
rose
cried
jack
norris
as
he
caught
dotty
dancing
black
eyes
i
might
have
known
you
were
at
the
head
of
this
no
more
than
dolly
fayre
cried
dotty
and
all
the
rest
of
us
are
you
hungry
boys
are
we
hungry
we
should
smile
we
been
hungry
all
the
while
came
in
chorus
from
the
famished
tramps
you
care
to
come
to
lunch
with
us
said
dolly
her
blue
eyes
dancing
as
she
put
the
question
would
we
care
to
and
jack
grinned
at
her
we
hungry
enough
to
eat
you
girls
but
alas
kind
ladies
we
obliged
to
regret
your
invitation
as
we
not
in
proper
society
garb
suddenly
the
boys
became
aware
of
their
flannel
shirts
and
old
hats
and
general
fishermanlike
appearance
we
forgive
that
for
once
cried
dotty
we
pretend
we
a
rescue
party
and
you
a
lot
of
starving
soldiers
so
we
wo
mind
your
tattered
uniforms
rescue
party
cried
bob
i
like
that
are
you
the
sly
ones
who
raided
our
commissariat
department
own
up
now
what
makes
you
think
so
and
edith
holmes
looked
the
picture
of
injured
innocence
oh
yes
makes
us
think
so
what
makes
us
think
that
our
coffee
boiling
in
our
coffee
pot
fair
ladies
we
invite
you
to
lunch
with
us
on
our
coffee
and
our
bacon
and
eggs
and
if
you
wait
a
few
minutes
we
cook
our
trout
for
you
well
i
tell
you
what
and
dolly
settled
the
question
we
eat
our
luncheon
now
as
it
all
ready
and
then
if
you
like
you
can
cook
your
fish
afterward
that
suits
me
said
bob
and
i
free
to
confess
that
i
ca
wait
another
minute
to
attack
this
lay
out
take
seats
everybody
i
mean
you
girls
sit
down
and
us
chaps
will
wait
on
you
all
right
laughed
dolly
we
resign
in
your
favour
i
can
tell
you
girls
get
hungry
too
so
the
girls
sat
around
and
the
boys
quickly
passed
plates
and
napkins
and
then
the
dishes
of
delicious
food
then
they
served
themselves
and
sitting
down
by
the
girls
rapidly
demolished
the
contents
of
their
plates
i
not
going
to
rub
it
in
said
dolly
dimpling
with
smiles
but
for
boys
who
do
want
girls
along
on
their
picnics
you
seem
to
enjoy
our
society
fairly
well
it
is
our
society
they
enjoying
said
nellie
north
it
our
stuffed
eggs
and
cold
chicken
it
both
adorable
damsels
declared
bob
just
let
us
appease
our
hunger
and
goodness
knows
you
enough
stuff
here
for
a
regiment
and
then
we
show
you
how
we
appreciate
the
blessing
of
your
society
we
entertain
you
any
way
you
choose
that
we
will
agreed
guy
we
give
you
a
circus
performance
a
concert
lecture
or
song
and
dance
as
you
decree
but
it
took
a
long
time
to
satisfy
the
boys
appetites
it
seemed
as
if
they
could
never
get
enough
of
the
various
delicacies
and
though
they
pretended
to
make
fun
of
what
they
called
the
frills
they
thoroughly
relished
the
good
things
these
eggs
ought
to
be
shaved
said
bob
as
he
picked
the
little
fringes
of
white
tissue
paper
from
a
devilled
egg
no
critical
remarks
please
said
dolly
offering
him
a
rolled
up
sandwich
tied
with
a
narrow
white
ribbon
oh
my
goodness
do
i
eat
ribbon
and
all
i
can
do
magical
stunts
for
you
afterward
like
the
chap
who
pulls
yards
of
ribbon
out
of
his
mouth
on
the
stage
anybody
who
makes
fun
of
our
things
ca
have
any
declared
josie
oh
i
not
making
fun
and
bob
took
half
a
dozen
of
the
tiny
sandwiches
why
i
always
have
my
meals
tied
up
in
ribbons
i
have
sashes
on
my
and
neckties
on
my
eggs
always
i
like
these
baskets
filled
with
fruit
salad
said
bert
as
he
helped
himself
to
another
i
think
food
in
baskets
is
the
only
real
proper
way
but
at
last
even
the
hungry
fishermen
declared
they
could
eat
another
bite
and
the
young
people
left
the
feast
and
sat
on
the
rocks
and
tree
stumps
near
by
while
long
sam
and
ephraim
cleared
away
and
packed
up
the
things
to
take
home
the
boys
were
as
good
as
their
word
and
entertained
the
girls
by
singing
college
songs
and
giving
gay
imitations
and
stunts
and
everybody
declared
as
the
picnic
finally
broke
up
that
it
had
been
the
very
best
one
of
the
season
chapter
xiv
the
cake
contest
oh
go
in
for
it
edith
holmes
was
saying
as
she
and
maisie
norris
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
rose
shack
and
tried
to
persuade
dotty
and
dolly
to
agree
to
their
plan
but
i
never
made
a
cake
in
my
life
dolly
objected
nor
i
either
said
dotty
i
do
see
how
we
can
edith
you
a
regular
born
cook
and
that
different
but
maybe
you
a
regular
born
cook
too
argued
edith
you
tell
if
you
never
have
tried
anyway
enter
the
contest
just
for
fun
urged
maisie
everybody
will
help
with
the
bazaar
and
of
course
you
want
to
be
in
it
and
i
want
you
to
be
in
this
contest
because
all
us
girls
are
i
just
as
lieve
said
dolly
only
there
no
chance
of
our
winning
the
prize
well
never
mind
if
you
do
you
have
a
lot
of
fun
and
besides
it
will
teach
you
to
make
cake
and
that
a
good
thing
to
know
that
funny
old
maria
of
yours
will
help
you
but
would
it
be
fair
to
have
her
help
us
oh
of
course
not
the
cake
you
must
do
that
yourselves
but
she
can
tell
you
how
or
show
you
how
and
you
can
practise
all
you
like
beforehand
of
course
and
you
might
win
the
prize
after
all
what
is
the
prize
a
twenty
dollar
gold
piece
what
a
grand
prize
i
did
know
it
was
such
a
big
one
well
you
see
old
van
zandt
gives
it
she
a
crank
on
domestic
science
and
girls
knowing
how
to
cook
and
all
that
and
besides
be
lots
of
entries
all
the
girls
all
round
the
lake

anybody
send
any
girl

sixteen
they
call
it
the
sweet
sixteen
cake
prize
all
right
let
do
it
said
dotty
and
dolly
said
i
willing
but
it
seems
nonsensical
when
we
do
know
a
thing
about
making
cake
and
less
than
a
week
to
learn
in
but
we
can
have
a
try
at
it
anyway
and
we
be
in
the
fun
hey
dotsy
all
right
then
said
maisie
delightedly
i
tell
miss
travers
that
you
two
girls

the
contest
she
be
delighted
she
at
the

the
two
d
conferred
with
rose
about
the
matter

i

first
and
if
you

a
little
more
elaborate
kind
every

by
the
end
of
the
week
you
ought
to
be
able
to
concoct
almost
anything
i
do
want
to
be
discouraging
but
i
can
hardly
think

the
prize

i
remember
last

the
biggest
price
possible

they
convinced
maria
of
her
part
in
the
undertaking
and
with
more
or
less
grumbling
she
proceeded
to
enlighten
the
girls
in
the
mysteries
of
cake
making
the
old
cook
was
not
trammelled
by
definite
recipes
and
her
rules
seemed
to
be
a
little
of
dis
and
a
right
smart
lot
of
dat
but
even
so
she
was
a
good
teacher
and
at
the
end
of
the
first
lesson
the
girls
had
each
a
round
cake
plain
but
light
and
wholesome
and
delicately
browned
these
were
proudly
exhibited
at
the
family
luncheon
and
were
at
once
appropriated
by
bob
and
bert
who
immediately
constituted
themselves
a
court
of
final
judgment
and
declared
their
intention
of
eating
all
the
preliminary
cakes
that
would
be
made
during
the
week
lessons
so
interested
did
the
girls
become
that
every
morning
they
spent
in
the
kitchen
rose
expressed
a
mock
terror
lest
his
bills
for
butter
and
eggs
should
land
him
in
the
but
the
went
on
and
more
and
more
elaborate
confections
were
turned
out
by
the
rapidly
progressing
cooks
rose
declared
that
it
was
her
opinion
that
doctors
bills
were
imminent
if
indeed
the
whole
family
would
not
soon
be
in
the
hospital
but
though
the
boys
and
genie
ate
a
fair
portion
of
the
cakes
much
more
was
consumed
by
the
neighbouring
young
people
who
formed
a
habit
of
drifting
in
to
crosstrees
camp
afternoons
to
sample
the
morning
work
the
days
brought
plum
cakes
and
marble
cakes
chocolate
cocoanut
custard
and
jelly
cakes
once
having
achieved
the
knack
of
making
the
cake
itself
the
fillings
or
elaborations
were
not
difficult
the
girls
took
the
matter
rather
seriously
but
as
the
great
day
drew
nearer
they
began
to
have
a
glimmering
hope
that
they
might
achieve
the
prize
after
all
but
oh
dollyrinda
exclaimed
dotty
impulsively
if
my
cake
should
take
the
prize
ahead
of
yours
i
cry
my
eyes
out
and
if
your
cake
took
the
prize
ahead
of
mine
i
never
speak
to
you
again
dolly
laughed
i
been
thinking
about
that
too
dot
and
do
you
know
i
think
it
would
be
nicest
for
us
to
make
only
one
cake
and
make
it
together
and
enter
it
under
both
our
names
and
then
if
it
takes
the
prize
we
can
divide
the
twenty
dollars
dotty
drew
a
long
sigh
of
relief
that
is
the
best
way
doll
i
never
thought
of
that
to
be
sure
we
run
a
double
chance
with
two
cakes
but
it
would
be
horrid
for
one
of
them
to
take
the
prize
so
let
devote
all
our
energies
to
one
beautiful
splendiferous
cake
that
will
be
so
perfect
nobody
else
will
have
any
chance
at
all
yes
that
what
i
think
now
what
kind
shall
it
be
this
was
the
great
question
the
girls
had
proved
apt
pupils
for
they
had
a
housewifely
knack
and
maria
was
really
a
superior
teacher
they
had
learned
the
art
of
pound
cake
the
trick
of
sponge
cake
and
had
even
penetrated
the
mysteries
of
fruit
cake
they
had
learned
to
make
raisin
cake
without
having
all
the
raisins
sink
to
a
thick
mat
at
the
bottom
they
had
learned
in
all
its
forms
from
the
puffy
golden
sort
to
the
most
dark
spicy
variety
angel
food
and
sunshine
cake
presented
no
difficulties
to
them
and
layer
cakes
were
their
happy
hunting
ground
also
they
were
past
grand
masters
in
the
matter
of
icing
they
could
boil
sugar
through
its
seven
stages
of
spun
thread
and
they
even
experimented
with
a
few
confectioners
implements
in
the
matter
of
fancy
decoration
and
borders
it
seems
to
me
said
dotty
as
they
held
solemn
conclave
over
the
great
question
that
our
trick
is
to
invent
an
absolutely
new
combination
of
flavours
or
ingredients
say
cocoanut
stirred
into
chocolate
icing
or
something
that
different
from
the
regulation
mountain
cake
or
cake
i
sure
we
can
think
of
some
new
idea
that
will
be
perfectly
stunning
i
do
agree
with
you
dot
and
dolly
looked
solemnly
thoughtful
as
her
blue
eyes
stared
into
dotty
black
ones
now
i
think
this
way
a
more
simple
cake
but
of
perfect
quality
and
with
a
plain
but
beautiful
icing
that
will
charm
by
its
very
simplicity
that
a
fine
line
of
talk
doll
and
sounds
well
put
in
bert
who
was
present
with
bob
as
advisory
board
but
i
doubt
if
go
down
with
the
powers
that
be
you
see
after
all
they
on
the
lookout
for
novelty
and
elaborate
messes
i
not
so
sure
of
that
and
bob
shook
his
head
perhaps
idea
is
so
worse
it
like
a
beautiful
big
white
monument
being
more
impressive
than
a
lot
of
architecture
oh
we
would
make
cried
dotty
laughing
but
i
see
a
plain
cake
taking
a
prize
i
tell
you
it
got
to
have
an
unusual
combination
of
materials
i
ca
get
away
from
the
idea
that
a
novel
mixture
of
just
the
right
kind
of
flavouring
would
turn
the
trick
and
i
positive
that
simplicity
is
the
note
to
strike
for
dolly
said
this
with
a
faraway
look
in
her
eyes
as
if
she
saw
the
vision
of
the
beautiful
cake
she
was
planning
stick
to
it
doll
cried
bob
you
got
the
right
idea
or
i
a
loser
you
boys
go
away
now
and
dolly
brows
wrinkled
in
serious
thought
this
is
no
time
for
fooling
and
dot
and
i
have
to
decide
this
thing
realising
the
gravity
of
the
occasion
the
boys
went
off
and
the
two
girls
settled
down
to
a
desperate
confab
neither
of
them
was
insistent
merely
because
she
wanted
her
own
way
but
each
was
eager
for
success
and
quite
ready
to
settle
their
controversy
by
careful
weighing
of
each
other
arguments
at
last
after
a
long
discussion
they
reached
their
conclusions
and
went
down
to
the
kitchen
to
construct
what
they
had
finally
decided
would
be
the
best
plan
for
their
masterpiece
very
carefully
they
worked
dolly
slow
sure
and
very
particular
as
to
measurements
and
combinations
dotty
quick
beating
the
batter
like
mad
whisking
eggs
and
sifting
sugar
in
a
whirl
of
excitement
and
when
the
great
work
was
accomplished
and
the
marvellous
result
set
on
the
table
for
exhibition
the
family
came
in
to
gaze
in
an
awed
silence
on
the
beautiful
cake
no
one
was
allowed
to
see
it
but
the
household
for
of
course
it
was
kept
secret
from
the
other
contestants
the
cake
was
a
marvel
of
beauty
and
it
combined
the
best
ideas
of
the
plans
of
the
two
girls
it
was
square
in
shape
instead
of
round
as
that
gave
a
touch
of
novelty
it
was
only
two
layers
but
the
layers
were
of
the
most
exquisitely
textured
angel
food
which
had
after
three
attempts
graciously
consented
to
turn
out
just
right
between
the
layers
was
a
filling
which
followed
in
a
measure
idea
of
novelty
it
was
a
combination
of
confectioners
icing
whipped
cream
pineapple
juice
and
a
few
delicate
feathery
flakes
of
freshly
grated
cocoanut
this
delectable
mixture
was
novel
and
of
charming
delicacy
but
the
icing
was
dolly
triumph
the
square
cake
large
and
high
was
covered
so
smoothly
with
white
icing
that
not
a
lump
or
a
crack
marred
the
perfect
surface
of
its
top
and
sides
there
were
no
decorations
save
three
lines
of
icing
that
delicately
outlined
the
square
top
the
trueness
of
these
lines
was
a
wonder
and
only
dolly
steady
hand
as
she
traced
them
with
a
paper
cornucopia
of
icing
could
have
resulted
in
such
an
effective
scheme
it
is
perfectly
wonderful
said
rose
looking
at
it
as
an
artist
it
like
the
taj
mahal
or
some
such
world
wonder
it
perfectly
exquisite
said
rose
as
she
bent
over
to
examine
it
and
then
walked
away
to
view
it
from
a
distance
i
never
saw
such
icing
how
did
you
do
it
girlies
dolly
did
that
said
dotty
only
because
you
were
so
excited
your
hand
wiggled
said
dolly
who
was
always
placid
whatever
happened
but
the
filling
is
invention
and
it
just
fine
we
put
some
of
it
on
another
cake
and
i
want
you
all
to
taste
it
so
they
all
sampled
the
other
cake
and
tested
the
flavour
like
connoisseurs
ripping
exclaimed
bob
out
of
sight
remarked
bert
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
the
boys
were
vociferous
the
older
people
were
enthusiastic
but
one
and
all
agreed
that
there
had
never
been
such
a
cake
built
before
and
that
it
would
surely
win
the
prize
are
you
going
to
send
it
over
now
asked
rose
no
said
dotty
we
going
to
take
it
with
us
when
we
go
ourselves
i
would
trust
it
to
anybody
for
it
might
get
joggled
and
crack
the
icing
put
it
in
the
pantry
dolly
i
dare
touch
it
myself
dotty
was
quivering
with
excitement
but
dolly
steady
hand
carefully
lifted
the
precious
cake
and
carried
it
safely
to
the
pantry
later
in
the
afternoon
the
girls
made
ready
to
go
to
the
bazaar
they
were
to
serve
as
assistants
in
the
cake
department
for
the
majority
of
the
cakes
were
to
be
sold
the
prize
cake
and
those
having
honourable
mention
would
be
exhibited
and
later
sold
at
auction
but
much
cake
would
be
disposed
of
at
the
regular
sale
they
wore
white
dresses
with
pale
green
ribbons
which
was
the
costume
of
all
connected
with
that
department
of
the
bazaar
very
pretty
they
looked
as
they
came
dancing
downstairs
for
inspection
you
do
girlies
she
commented
your
frocks
are
all
right
be
over
later
i
hate
to
have
you
carry
that
big
cake
dolly
oh
i
must
rose
i
would
trust
it
to
any
one
else
bert
offered
to
take
it
and
bob
did
too
but
if
they
should
drop
it
or
anything
i
never
get
over
the
disappointment
we
worked
so
hard
on
it
and
it
is
lovely
and
if
we
can
just
get
it
there
safely
sure
it
will
get
honourable
mention
at
least
it
ought
to
take
the
prize
said
rose
enthusiastically
but
do
get
your
hopes
up
too
high
for
there
nothing
surer
than
disappointment
be
very
careful
as
you
get
in
the
boat
dolly
indeed
yes
but
long
sam
is
such
a
kind
old
thing
i
know
he
do
all
he
can
not
to
joggle
but
to
run
very
steadily
all
the
way
the
bazaar
was
held
in
a
hotel
which
was
some
distance
down
the
lake
but
dolly
did
not
fear
any
accident
while
on
the
motor
boat
she
was
only
apprehensive
lest
some
one
push
against
her
as
she
made
her
way
into
the
building
or
into
the
cake
booth
for
one
little
crumb
of
broken
icing
or
one
dent
on
its
perfect
surface
would
spoil
to
dolly
anxious
eye
the
perfection
of
their
cake
chapter
xv
who
won
the
prize

sweaters
said
dolly
as
she
handed
the
two
white
fleecy
garments
to
dotty

carry
them
dot
and
i
carry
the
cake
you
be
sure
to

dotty
took
the
two

and
flung

over

knowing
the
precious
cake
would
be
safer
in
dolly
steady
hand

said
as
she
tucked
a
handkerchief
into
her
sash
folds

and
i

dolly
went
to
the
kitchen
and
on
through
to
the
pantry
where
she
had
left
the
cake
on
a
shelf
by
the
window
but
it
was
not
there
maria
she
called
wondering
what
the
old
darky
had
done
with
it
there
was
no
reply
and
dolly
called
again
louder
yas

and
the
old
cook
came
in
at
the
back
door
of
the
kitchen
what

maria
black
eyes
rolled
in
dismay
somebody
done
stole

stole
it
nonsense
nobody
would
do
that
dot
and
dolly
loud
call
brought
dotty
flying
rose
followed
and
both
stood
aghast
with
consternation
when
dolly
announced
the
cake
is
gone
gone
what
do
you
mean
and
dotty
looked
around
the
shelves
in
a
dazed
sort
of
way
i
mean
what
i
say
cried
dolly
impatiently
our
cake
is
gone
and
as
maria
says
somebody
must
have
stolen
it
stolen
it
our
cake
and
dotty
gave
a
wild
shriek
it
ca
be
stolen
said
rose
looking
puzzled
we
never
had
anything
stolen
all
the
years
we
been
here
then
where
is
it
demanded
dolly
where
can
it
be
did
you
take
it
into
the
suggested
rose
unable
to
think
of
any
other
solution
of
the
mystery
no
indeed
i
left
it
right
here
till
we
were
ready
to
start
i
had
it
in
the
open
window
because
the
kitchen
was
so
hot
and
of
course
some
tramp
has
come
along
and
stolen
it
oh
dotty
what
shall
we
do
but
dotty
was
beyond
speech
her
staring
eyes
gazed
at
the
table
where
the
cake
had
been
vaguely
she
glanced
round
the
pantry
shelves
and
then
flew
through
the
kitchen
to
the
and
looked
all
around
there
but
of
course
she
saw
no
cake
for
dolly
had
left
it
in
the
pantry
where
are
the
boys
asked
dolly
suddenly
gone
to
a
motor
boat
race
said
rose
they
went
off
half
an
hour
ago
but
they
would
steal
your
cake
they
might
do
it
for
a
joke
said
dolly
no
said
rose
decidedly
they
would
do
that
they
were
too
interested
in
the
success
of
you
girls
and
they
felt
about
that
cake
just
as
we
all
did
no
bob
and
bert
never
stole
the
cake
genie
upstairs
i
think
said
dotty
and
going
to
the
foot
of
the
staircase
she
called
her
sister
genie
came
running
down
and
was
as
greatly
disturbed
as
the
other
girls
at
the
disappearance
of
the
cake
of
course
i
never
touched
it
she
said
indignantly
i
wanted
my
dotty
and
my
dolly
to
take
the
prize
do
you
i
steal
their
lovely
cake
there
was
no
mistaking
the
little
girl
honesty
and
good
faith
and
rose
said
finally
then
it
have
been
stolen
by
some
one
passing
by
but
i
ca
understand
it
there
are
no
tramps
around
here
long
sam
is
as
honest
as
the
day
and
nobody
else
would
be
passing
by
this
window
i
wish
your
father
were
here
dotty
so
do
i
but
he
could
do
anything
the
cake
gone
and
it
must
have
been
taken
by
somebody
what
do
you
say
if
we
make
another
dolly
dolly
looked
blank
make
another
she
said
slowly
why
it
three
now
and
the
fair
begins
at
four
we
could
do
it
dot
and
anyway
we
could
make
a
prize
one
i
would
have
the
heart
to
try
again
as
hard
as
i
did
for
that
one
would
you
yes
i
would
i
just
like
to
fly
at
it
and
make
one
as
good
as
that
or
better
i
know
who
stole
that
cake
dorinda
fayre
it
was
some
girl
who
had
made
a
cake
herself
and
who
was
afraid
ours
would
take
the
prize
and
so
she
came
and
stole
it
oh
dorothy
rose
are
you
ashamed
to
think
such
a
thing
and
anyway
how
could
any
girl
do
that
even
if
she
was
mean
enough
of
course
she
could
and
dotty
eyes
flashed
everybody
knew
about
our
cake
and
they
knew
it
would
take
the
prize
and
so
of
course
they
wanted
it
out
of
the
way
now
that
just
what
happened
because
the
only
thing
that
can
have
happened
as
mother
says
there
are
any
tramps
around
here
we
always
set
cakes
or
pies
on
that
window
shelf
and
they
never
been
stolen
come
on
i
say
let
make
another
i
hate
to
have
any
girl
get
ahead
of
me
like
that
oh
dotty
it
just
seems
as
if
i
could
make
another
why
we
were
three
hours
on
that
one
this
morning
it
would
be
after
six
before
we
could
get
another
done
and
i
know
it
would
be
any
good
i
too
upset
to
make
it
properly
i
all
of
a
quiver
and
besides
we
have
all
the
things
in
the
house
no
we
no
pineapple
but
let
make
some
other
kind
of
a
cake
chocolate
or
something
yes
i
think
i
see
a
chocolate
cake
taking
the
prize
why
do
you
make
and
be
done
with
it
that
prize
wo
go
to
any
common
kind
of
cake
like
chocolate
it
might
if
it
was
awful
good
chocolate
oh
dolly
our
cake
was
so
beautiful
and
dotty
overwrought
nerves
gave
way
and
she
burst
into
violent
sobbing
well
crying
wo
do
any
good
dot
and
dolly
drew
a
long
sigh
i
do
blame
you
for
crying
i
know
you
ca
help
it
but
i
seem
to
cry
i
too
too
flattened
out
dolly
looked
the
picture
of
disheartened
woe
but
it
was
not
her
nature
to
give
way
to
tears
she
felt
absolutely
dismayed
and
utterly
cast
down
as
if
under
a
depression
that
would
not
lift
but
she
gave
no
physical
sign
of
this
except
by
her
tense
drawn
face
and
her
frequent
despairing
sighs
it
just
awful
girlies
said
rose
full
of
helpless
sympathy
but
i
ca
think
of
anything
to
do
i
do
believe
you
could
make
another
cake
successfully
you
too
nervous
and
upset
both
of
you
maria
however
did
not
take
it
so
calmly
her
grief
was
more
boisterous
even
than
dolly
she
ran
round
the
kitchen
throwing
her
apron
over
her
head
and
wailing
and
moaning
like
a
crazy
woman
oh
dat
cake
dat
cake
she
groaned
dropping
into
a
chair
and
rocking
back
and
forth
in
ecstasies
of
woe
dat
hebenly
cake
miss
dotty
and
miss
dolly
yo
could
make
anudder
i
kin
help
yo
and
we
whisk
it
up
in
a
jiffy
do
make
some
kind
oh
do
now
no
maria
and
dolly
looked
positive
we
ca
make
another
cake
it
out
of
the
question
shall
we
go
to
the
fair
at
all
dot
yes
of
course
we
will
i
want
to
find
out
what
girl
was
mean
enough
and
smart
enough
to
cut
up
this
trick
come
on
then
you
better
wash
your
face
you
all
teary
looking
i
we
might
as
well
go
but
i
do
feel
a
bit
like
it
all
the
fun
gone
out
of
it
dotty
ran
away
to
bathe
her
reddened
eyes
and
dolly
gravely
walked
round
the
kitchen
looking
here
and
there
as
if
the
cake
might
have
voluntarily
hidden
itself
somewhere
it
most
mysterious
said
rose
i
never
heard
of
anything
being
stolen
up
in
this
region
before
i
wish
rose
were
here
but
of
course
he
could
do
anything
and
i
think
we
may
feel
sure
that
he
did
steal
the
cake
where
is
he
asked
dolly
smiling
a
little
at
the
jest
gone
over
to
the
norris
camp
i
think
i
wish
the
boys
were
here
of
course
they
could
do
anything
but
they
could
help
us
express
our
indignation
yes
they
could
do
that
but
it
would
do
any
real
good
hello
dot
ready
the
two
girls
started
off
down
the
path
and
rose
watched
them
go
with
a
sad
heart
she
knew
how
disappointed
they
were
after
all
their
trouble
to
make
the
cake
and
she
could
imagine
what
had
become
of
it
i
ca
believe
any
of
the
girls
came
and
took
it
she
said
to
maria
no
dat
dey
did
dat
cake
was
sperrited
away
by
dat
what
it
was
and
the
big
black
eyes
rolled
in
terrified
apprehension
yas
fer
certain
dat
what
happened
it
de
work
of
dem
sperrits
rose
went
on
into
the
house
unwilling
to
subscribe
to
theory
but
equally
unable
to
propound
any
of
her
own
the
girls
reached
the
hotel
where
the
fair
was
held
and
joined
the
gay
throngs
of
people
that
were
entering
hello
said
maisie
norris
as
she
met
them
where
your
cake
now
dolly
and
dotty
had
made
up
their
minds
not
to
tell
of
the
catastrophe
until
they
could
make
some
endeavour
to
find
out
if
there
were
any
suspicious
looks
or
hints
to
be
noticed
among
the
other
young
cake
makers
where
yours
dotty
said
to
maisie
oh
i
left
mine
in
the
committee
room
you
know
the
committee
take
all
the
cakes
and
then
those
that
have
any
chance
at
all
they
send
out
to
the
cake
table
to
be
sold
but
the
ones
that
have
a
chance
at
the
prize
they
keep
for
final
decision
they
kept
mine
so
far
but
edith
holmes
was
just
sent
out
it
too
bad
it
a
lovely
chocolate
cake
it
is
too
bad
agreed
dotty
but
i
do
believe
a
chocolate
cake
will
take
the
prize
do
you
no
probably
not
said
maisie
mine
a
variety
cake
what
sort
is
yours
dotty
hesitated
for
she
well
knew
they
had
no
cake
in
the
committee
room
but
dolly
said
we
made
up
ours
we
mixed
things
together
that
we
never
heard
of
combining
before
it
was
mostly
dot
invention
but
dolly
made
the
layers
and
did
the
icing
put
in
dotty
unwilling
to
take
all
the
credit
sounds
lovely
said
maisie
and
then
her
attention
was
diverted
elsewhere
and
she
ran
away
no
more
embarrassing
questions
were
asked
for
every
one
assumed
that
dotty
and
dolly
had
given
their
cake
to
the
committee
when
they
arrived
a
dozen
times
during
the
afternoon
they
were
asked
has
your
cake
been
sent
out
yet
and
they
truthfully
answered
no
but
no
hint
could
they
glean
from
the
words
or
looks
of
any
girl
to
make
them
suspect
i
ca
keep
it
up
any
longer
dot
said
dolly
at
last
in
an
undertone
i
feel
as
if
i
telling
a
lie
when
i
let
them
all
think
we
have
a
cake
with
the
committee
fiddlesticks
it
none
of
their
business
and
anyway
they
have
just
that
much
more
chance
at
the
prize
do
tell
anybody
doll
it
do
any
harm
to
keep
it
to
ourselves
and
if
one
certain
person
takes
the
prize
i
just
want
to
see
how
she
looks
or
what
she
says
when
i
tell
her
our
cake
was
stolen
why
dotty
rose
do
you
mean
to
say
you
suspect
anybody
i
do
say
that
and
i
wo
mention
any
name
even
to
you
but
just
you
wait
and
see
they
announce
the
prize
winner
at
six
and
it
after
five
now
so
dolly
deferred
to
dotty
wishes
in
the
matter
and
as
there
was
much
going
on
and
plenty
of
diverting
incidents
the
hour
slipped
away
and
soon
a
whisper
was
passed
around
that
the
committee
had
made
their
choice
van
zandt
the
aristocratic
and
somewhat
eccentric
old
lady
who
had
offered
the
prize
came
over
to
the
cake
table
and
smiled
as
she
began
her
speech
it
has
been
rather
difficult
she
said
to
decide
among
the
beautiful
and
delicious
cakes
selected
by
the
committee
for
my
final
test
there
were
half
a
dozen
at
the
last
judging
that
seemed
equally
well
made
and
delightful
of
taste
of
course
i
did
not
know
who
made
the
various
entries
and
so
i
decided
entirely
on
the
merits
of
the
cake
itself
and
considering
everything
the
method
the
execution
and
the
delicacy
of
flavours
i
adjudge
the
best
cake
submitted
in
this
contest
to
be
the
one
that
represents
the
joint
work
of
miss
dorothy
rose
and
miss
dorinda
fayre
and
i
greatly
pleased
to
present
these
two
young
ladies
with
the
golden
double
eagle
i
offered
as
a
prize
and
i
consider
it
well
earned
and
honestly
won
if
dolly
and
dotty
had
been
amazed
when
they
missed
the
cake
from
the
pantry
window
they
were
ten
times
more
amazed
now
what
could
it
mean
there
must
be
some
mistake
dotty
quick
thought
was
that
somehow
their
names
had
been
connected
with
some
other
girl
cake
but
in
a
moment
that
illusion
was
dispelled
by
the
sight
of
their
own
beautiful
white
cake
being
brought
in
and
placed
in
the
very
centre
of
the
cake
table
it
was
positively
their
own
cake
although
a
portion
had
been
cut
from
one
corner
for
the
members
of
the
committee
to
taste
realising
that
by
some
miracle
their
cake
had
been
submitted
and
had
won
the
prize
dolly
and
dotty
suddenly
became
aware
that
they
must
do
their
part
and
together
they
stepped
forward
to
receive
the
prize
from
van
zandt
i
sorry
it
is
not
in
two
ten
dollar
gold
pieces
she
said
as
she
smilingly
held
it
out
to
the
blushing
girls
but
you
must
divide
it
between
you
smiling
dolly
and
dotty
held
out
their
hands
together
and
together
received
the
gold
piece
holding
it
between
them
as
they
bowed
their
thanks
then
there
was
a
hubbub
of
congratulations
and
laughter
and
chatter
from
the
girls
it
seemed
unnecessary
to
say
anything
about
the
cake
having
been
stolen
so
the
two
d
smiled
and
beamed
as
they
listened
to
flattering
words
about
their
prize
winning
cake
soon
they
were
flying
homeward
to
tell
the
family
all
about
it
our
cake
was
there
and
we
took
the
prize
cried
dotty
as
they
rushed
into
the
of
the
rose
bungalow
how
did
it
get
there
cried
rose
and
rose
and
genie
exclaimed
in
surprise
while
maria
appeared
in
the
kitchen
doorway
holding
up
her
hands
and
crying
out
dem
sperrits
jes
nachelley
wafted
dat
cake
right
ober
to
de
fair
place
we
do
know
dolly
went
on
taking
up
the
tale
i
asked
two
or
three
ladies
of
the
committee
and
they
did
seem
to
know
anything
about
it
about
how
it
got
there
they
just
said
it
was
there
entered
in
our
names
and
it
sounded
so
silly
to
ask
them
to
find
out
who
brought
it
that
i
just
did
it
our
cake
declared
dotty
and
it
took
the
prize
so
all
right
but
however
did
it
get
there
unless
it
walked
over
itself
you
did
take
it
did
you
daddy
no
said
rose
i
did
not
i
would
willingly
have
done
so
but
you
girls
insisted
on
taking
it
yourselves
just
then
the
boys
rushed
in
great
sport
cried
bob
flinging
his
cap
and
sweater
on
a
chair
norris
boat
is
the
swiftest
thing
ever
you
bet
it
is
wow
but
it
was
a
great
race
and
bert
fayre
waved
his
hands
in
enthusiasm
hello
girls
did
your
dinky
white
cake
catch
the
gold
piece
did
you
bamboozle
the
judges
into
thinking
it
was
fit
to
eat
yes
we
did
cried
dolly
her
blue
eyes
sparkling
with
delight
but
oh
bert
what
do
you
think
we
do
know
how
the
cake
got
there
got
there
why
bob
and
i
took
it
over
we
knew
you
girls
never
could
transport
that
masterpiece
of
modern
architecture
all
that
way
in
safety
you
boys
took
it
over
and
dotty
looked
dumfounded
sure
we
did
said
bob
were
you
glad
but
why
did
you
tell
us
we
almost
went
crazy
crazy
nothing
we
left
a
note
on
the
pantry
shelf
saying
we
took
it
we
called
to
you
girls
but
you
were
primping
in
your
room
and
answer
maria
was
on
deck
so
i
just
scribbled
on
a
paper
that
taken
the
cake
and
left
the
paper
in
its
place
bob
looked
injured
at
the
thought
that
their
kindness
was
not
appreciated
we
did
see
any
note
said
dolly
where
did
you
leave
it
right
on
the
pantry
shelf
where
we
took
the
cake
away
from
you
seem
awful
grateful
for
what
we
thought
would
be
a
boon
and
a
blessing
to
you
i
can
tell
you
we
had
to
work
pretty
hard
to
get
the
old
thing
over
there
without
a
smooch
on
it
and
i
did
dare
put
anything
over
it
for
fear
it
would
stick
to
the
icing
while
he
was
talking
dotty
had
flown
out
to
the
pantry
and
returned
with
the
bit
of
scribbled
paper
here
it
is
she
cried
it
was
on
the
floor
under
the
shelf
must
have
blown
off
said
bert
carelessly
well
no
harm
done
cake
got
there
all
right
took
prize
all
right
everybody
happy
yes
we
are
now
and
dolly
grinned
contentedly
but
we
had
a
pretty
miserable
afternoon
oh
pshaw
now
and
bob
tweaked
the
black
curls
that
clustered
round
her
temple
you
must
have
known
we
took
it
even
without
the
note
where
else
it
have
gone
to
that
so
agreed
dotty
and
it
all
right
now
but
next
time
you
leave
an
important
document
for
me
do
leave
it
in
an
open
window
on
a
breezy
afternoon
chapter
xvi
a
walk
in
the
woods
only
three
days
left
of
camp
crosstrees
said
dolly
as
the
girls
sat
in
the
shack
one
summer
afternoon
i
never
knew
two
weeks
to
slip
away
so
quickly
do
you
love
it
said
dotty
looking
around
at
the
various
delights
of
camp
life
the
wooded
hills
and
the
distant
mountains
nothing
like
it
doll
i
wish
we
did
ever
have
to
go
back
to
town
you
have
your
visit
with
me
before
we
go
back
to
berwick
i
wonder
if
you
will
like
surfwood
dotty
i
love
the
seashore
i
know
but
i
do
know
about
liking
the
big
hotel
do
you
have
to
keep
dressed
up
all
the
time
and
all
that
why
we
do
wear
party
clothes
all
the
time
of
course
we
ca
go
around
in
an
old
serge
skirt
and
middy
blouse
as
we
do
here
but
mornings
we
wear
ginghams
or
linen
frocks
and
late
in
the
afternoon
dress
up
nice
awful
bother
fixing
up
so
i
like
to
go
round
as
we
do
here
nobody
cares
what
they
wear
in
camp
of
course
it
awfully
different
at
the
hotel
but
you
like
it
after
you
get
there
i
do
see
why
you
object
to
dressing
decently
only
a
habit
going
around
in
these
old
regimentals
dolly
looked
with
distaste
at
her
brown
serge
skirt
and
her
tan
stockings
and
shoes
the
latter
decidedly
the
worse
for
wear
and
scarred
and
scratched
by
stones
and
brambles
oh
i
got
plenty
of
good
clothes
mother
been
fixing
them
all
in
order
and
i
know
i
like
it
to
be
down
there
two
weeks
with
you
but
i
mean
for
a
whole
summer
i
rather
be
up
here
tramping
around
the
woods
and
dressing
like
sam
scratch
than
to
fuss
up
fancy
every
day
i
would
i
had
an
awful
good
time
up
here
on
this
visit
but
for
a
whole
summer
i
rather
be
at
the
seashore
and
at
a
hotel
where
i
wear
pretty
white
dresses
and
silk
stockings
and
slippers
are
we
different
and
dotty
laughed
as
she
looked
at
her
golden
haired
friend
sometimes
i
wonder
doll
that
we
such
good
friends
when
we
so
awfully
different
everything
i
like
you
hate
and
everything
you
like
i
hate
oh
not
quite
that
in
lots
of
ways
we
like
the
same
things
no
we
do
i
like
to
go
off
in
the
woods
on
long
tramps
and
rather
lie
around
here
on
a
lot
of
balsam
pillows
and
read
a
story
book
or
do
nothing
at
all
i
expect
i
lazy
no
you
not
not
a
bit
of
it
you
ready
enough
to
work
if
anything
you
like
to
do
why
at
a
picnic
you
do
more
than
all
the
rest
put
together
we
just
different
that
all
you
and
good
natured
and
i
a
spitfire
well
i
guess
it
good
for
us
to
be
different
and
so
we
influence
each
other
and
that
good
for
both
of
us
well
i
influence
you
right
now
to
go
for
a
ramble
in
the
woods
it
lovely
just
the
kind
of
a
day
when
the
breeze
sings
in
the
trees
and
the
birds
flutter
low
and
you
can
watch
them
all
right
i
go
if
you
do
go
too
far
nor
walk
too
fast
only
three
days
more
up
here
and
we
wo
have
many
more
chances
to
go
woodsing
so
come
on
all
right
we
a
good
long
afternoon
you
go
ask
maria
for
some
cookies
and
fruit
and
i
go
tell
mother
we
going
but
do
let
genie
know
we
do
want
her
along
for
she
gets
tired
in
about
an
hour
dolly
went
in
search
of
maria
half
sorry
that
genie
was
excluded
from
the
party
for
unhampered
by
the
child
dotty
was
apt
to
walk
fast
and
far
in
her
untiring
energy
but
dolly
could
always
make
her
stop
and
rest
by
a
reference
to
the
weak
muscles
that
still
troubled
her
a
little
on
a
long
walk
the
girls
had
entirely
recovered
from
their
broken
bones
but
dolly
was
an
indolent
nature
and
disinclined
to
great
exertion
at
any
time
carrying
their
sweaters
and
a
box
of
food
they
started
off
for
their
tramp
in
the
woods
i
want
to
get
a
whole
lot
of
birch
bark
dolly
said
as
they
walked
along
let
look
for
particularly
nice
pieces
and
get
a
whole
lot
to
take
with
us
down
to
the
seashore
what
for
oh
to
make
fancy
work
out
of
everybody
does
fancy
work
and
they
have
bazaars
something
like
the
one
where
we
took
the
cake
prize
and
we
can
make
lovely
things
out
of
birch
bark
for
the
bazaar
tables
all
right
we
gather
a
heap
what
shall
we
do
with
our
cake
prize
doll
save
it
or
spend
it
i
rather
spend
it
i
think
it
would
be
nice
if
we
bought
something
special
with
it
two
things
you
know
just
alike
to
remember
our
first
cake
by
something
to
wear
maybe
a
ring
or
a
pin
or
something
could
get
much
of
a
ring
for
ten
dollars
and
we
got
a
lot
of
little
fancy
pins
both
of
us
what
do
you
say
to
a
gold
pencil
for
each
only
they
never
write
very
well
the
leads
are
so
hard
that
so
well
maybe
beads
or
how
about
a
lace
collar
let
wait
till
we
get
down
to
surfwood
and
ask
trudy
she
tell
us
something
nice
and
maybe
we
buy
something
there
or
else
in
new
york
as
we
go
through
on
the
way
down
all
right
here
some
good
birch
bark
only
it
yellowish
let
keep
on
till
we
find
some
whiter
the
pair
rambled
on
happily
chatting
and
laughing
and
now
and
then
sitting
down
to
rest
or
to
refresh
themselves
from
the
box
of
lunch
which
was
rapidly
growing
lighter
we
have
an
awful
lot
of
bark
said
dotty
looking
at
the
big
bundles
they
had
collected
yes
too
much
let
chuck
out
the
worst
pieces
and
just
keep
the
best
and
i
like
some
more
of
that
silvery
kind
it
awful
pretty
combined
with
this
dark
yellow
to
make
things
we
want
to
get
some
big
pieces
a
portfolio
of
the
silvery
kind
lined
with
yellow
is
lovely
yes
with
one
corner
turned
back
and
a
ribbon
bow
on
it
yes
or
tied
with
sweet
grass
there
a
big
tree
on
ahead
we
can
get
some
there
i
sure
all
right
and
there
another
tree
out
there
that
a
dandy
eagerly
they
went
on
absorbed
in
their
fascinating
quest
for
the
hunting
of
birch
bark
is
ever
enticing
and
lures
one
on
to
further
treasures
like
a
mirage
we
ca
carry
another
scrap
said
dolly
at
last
laughing
to
see
dotty
with
her
arms
full
of
rolls
of
bark
and
more
pieces
gathered
up
in
her
skirt
no
we
sit
down
and
straighten
this
out
and
roll
it
up
and
finish
the
cookies
and
throw
away
the
box
and
then
we
go
home
it
was
hard
to
throw
away
any
of
the
beautiful
bark
for
they
had
gathered
only
fine
specimens
and
the
quantity
they
finally
selected
to
keep
was
a
goodly
load
we
put
on
our
sweaters
said
dolly
so
we
can
carry
it
all
no
heavier
than
that
lunch
box
was
no
heavier
agreed
dotty
but
a
good
deal
more
bunglesome
and
awkward
to
carry
each
girl
had
a
big
fat
roll
under
each
arm
and
turning
they
started
gaily
along
in
single
file
you
go
first
said
dolly
stepping
back
i
not
sure
i
know
the
way
i
declare
to
goodness
dot
i
do
see
how
you
remember
the
way
yourself
you
got
a
regular
guide
brain
under
that
black
mop
of
yours
how
do
you
know
which
way
to
go
when
you
ca
see
anything
but
trees
easy
as
pie
dotty
called
back
over
her
shoulder
just
follow
the
nose
of
dorothy
rose
and
away
she
goes
and
dotty
hopped
over
a
big
stone
while
dolly
walked
around
it
on
they
went
dotty
leading
the
way
and
dolly
following
it
getting
awfully
late
i
believe
the
sun
has
set
said
dolly
shivering
a
little
under
her
woollen
sweater
oh
no
the
sun
has
set
but
you
ca
see
it
in
these
thick
woods
we
soon
be
out
of
this
thick
part
now
we
came
quite
a
way
in
dollypops
a
million
miles
i
should
say
that
the
worst
of
you
dot
you
never
realise
that
all
the
walk
you
take
has
got
to
be
walked
back
again
took
a
walk
around
the
block
to
get
some
exercise
dotty
chanted
imitating
a
popular
song
which
was
a
favourite
with
the
boys
exercise
i
had
enough
to
last
me
the
rest
of
the
summer
honest
dot
i
got
to
rest
a
few
minutes
i
ca
walk
another
step
dollyrinda
fayre
you
do
give
out
the
easiest
of
anybody
i
ever
saw
sit
down
on
that
stone
and
rest
do
but
you
must
wait
long
for
i
guess
it
about
sunset
i
feel
sort
of
chilly
and
i
do
hear
the
birds
much
all
right
dotsy
i
rested
now
and
dolly
jumped
up
and
walked
on
she
tired
easily
but
also
a
rest
of
a
very
few
minutes
made
her
ready
to
walk
on
again
she
followed
dotty
in
silence
for
some
distance
and
then
said
you
sure
you
know
the
way
are
you
m
hmm
dotty
flung
back
over
her
shoulder
and
trudged
on
but
dolly
noticed
a
difference
in
dotty
attitude
she
walked
as
quickly
as
before
but
she
was
not
quite
so
alert
also
she
kept
turning
her
head
suddenly
from
side
to
side
with
a
gesture
of
an
inquisitive
bird
a
little
uncertain
which
way
to
fly
you
do
know
the
way
do
you
dotty
i
do
doll
do
be
silly
how
do
you
know
it
just
by
instinct
i
been
around
these
woods
so
much
i
just
kind
of
know
the
way
home
even
if
i
ca
see
out
do
you
see
this
kind
of
a
trail
we
just
follow
this
and
it
brings
us
out
right
by
our
own
camp
are
you
sure
yes
i
sure
what
the
matter
with
you
dolly
nothing
only
it
seems
as
if
we
walked
as
far
since
we
started
for
home
as
we
did
when
we
were
going
so
we
have
nearly
just
a
little
farther
now
and
we
come
into
that
clump
of
beech
woods
do
you
know
where
there
are
any
birch
trees
hardly
yes
i
know
where
you
mean
but
this
does
look
like
it
we
have
got
there
yet
that
why
you
would
think
birch
bark
would
be
so
heavy
would
you
i
do
mind
it
here
give
me
one
of
your
bundles
i
just
as
lieve
carry
it
as
not
give
me
the
one
out
of
your
left
wing
i
know
that
one
must
be
tired
i
wo
you
got
enough
to
carry
i
throw
my
left
hand
bundle
away
before
i
let
you
lug
it
oh
do
throw
it
away
it
a
shame
after
we
taken
such
trouble
to
gather
it
do
let
me
carry
it
dotty
no
sir
i
wo
do
it
i
do
mind
it
anyway
come
on
doll
hurry
a
little
do
you
think
it
getting
sort
of
dark
not
dark
exactly
but
dusky
here
under
the
trees
it
is
dusk
dolly
it
dark
i
mean
it
after
sunset
and
the
real
dark
will
settle
down
on
us
in
a
few
minutes
i
know
more
about
these
woods
than
you
do
and
i
know
we
want
to
get
along
faster
we
must
be
in
here
when
it
gets
really
dark
but
you
said
you
knew
the
way
dot
and
dolly
tone
was
anxious
i
do
most
always
but
if
we
been
on
the
right
track
we
ought
to
have
been
out
of
the
woods
before
this
i
must
have
got
turned
around
somehow
dotty
stopped
still
and
turned
a
despairing
face
toward
dolly
good
gracious
dot
you
do
mean
we
lost
i
hope
not
that
but
honest
i
do
know
which
way
to
go
why
not
go
straight
on
i
not
sure
but
i
think
that
leads
us
deeper
into
the
woods
why
dorothy
rose
you
that
was
the
way
home
i
know
i
did
and
i
thought
it
was
but
do
you
see
dolly
if
it
been
the
right
way
we
would
be
home
by
now
oh
dotty
what
are
we
going
to
do
dolly
face
took
on
a
expression
and
her
big
blue
eyes
stared
at
the
white
face
of
her
friend
i
frightened
dolly
i
i
never
was
lost
in
the
woods
before
nor
i
either
i
often
heard
of
people
being
lost
in
these
woods
when
they
were
really
quite
near
their
homes
one
man
was
lost
for
three
days
before
they
found
him
oh
do
say
such
dreadful
things
it
getting
awful
dark
and
cold
and
and
i
scared
i
all
those
things
too
oh
dolly
i
awfully
frightened
and
dotty
dropped
her
bundles
of
birch
bark
and
sitting
down
on
a
stone
began
to
cry
hysterically
now
dolly
fayre
was
the
sort
to
rise
to
an
emergency
where
dotty
rose
would
lose
her
head
completely
so
dolly
though
terribly
frightened
controlled
herself
and
sitting
down
put
her
arm
around
dotty
and
tried
to
cheer
her
brace
up
dot
it
ca
do
a
bit
of
good
to
cry
you
know
now
you
know
more
about
this
sort
of
thing
than
i
do
what
do
people
do
when
lost
in
the
woods
hol
holler
said
dotty
weakly
between
her
sobs
holler
like
fury
and
somebody
hears
them
and
maybe
they
all
right
let
holler
and
dolly
gave
a
yell
that
sounded
about
as
loud
and
carrying
as
the
pipe
or
a
bulfinch
who
do
you
hear
that
and
dotty
almost
smiled
through
her
tears
this
is
the
way
to
holler
dotty
gave
a
loud
scream
a
long
halloo
tapping
her
fingers
against
her
mouth
as
she
did
so
making
a
peculiar
mountain
cry
known
to
campers
all
right
i
do
that
too
and
dolly
set
up
a
rival
yell
but
though
both
girls
did
their
best
their
screams
were
not
very
loud
and
they
were
followed
by
a
silence
so
intense
that
they
shivered
and
clung
together
in
fear
the
dark
had
fallen
suddenly
and
though
only
about
seven
in
the
thick
woods
they
could
scarcely
see
each
other
faces
appalled
by
the
awfulness
of
the
situation
dolly
burst
into
tears
and
though
not
as
violent
as
dotty
her
sobs
were
deep
and
racking
ones
oh
do
dollyrinda
cry
so
i
never
forgive
myself
for
losing
you
in
these
awful
woods
you
did
lose
me
any
more
than
i
lost
you
we
both
lost
each
other
i
mean
i
guess
i
mean
we
both
lost
and
dolly
tears
fell
afresh
then
both
girls
gave
way
and
cried
desperately
till
they
could
cry
no
more
and
with
their
stayed
tears
they
seemed
to
take
a
brighter
outlook
if
we
lost
said
dolly
philosophically
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
are
there
any
wild
animals
that
would
eat
us
up
no
nothing
of
that
sort
nothing
but
squirrels
and
birds
and
they
ca
hurt
us
then
there
nothing
really
to
be
afraid
of
no
i
not
only
starving
to
death
and
catching
pneumonia
and
a
few
little
things
like
that
we
wo
starve
right
off
that
certain
said
dolly
practically
at
least
i
wo
i
so
fat
but
you
poor
little
picked
chicken
you
may
and
dolly
patted
the
thin
little
shivering
shoulders
that
snuggled
up
against
her
i
hungry
now
i
wish
we
saved
the
cookies
you
ca
be
hungry
dot
not
hungry
now
let
plan
what
to
do
shall
we
walk
on
and
take
our
chances
or
shall
we
camp
here
for
the
night
it
is
so
very
different
being
here
under
the
trees
or
under
our
own
trees
in
camp
is
very
different
hey
well
i
think
there
all
the
difference
in
the
world
what
are
you
going
to
sleep
on
what
are
you
going
to
cover
yourself
with
oh
you
know
we
could
sleep
anyway
when
we
lost
and
dotty
suddenly
gave
a
vigorous
yell
which
startled
dolly
nearly
out
of
her
wits
but
realising
what
it
was
for
she
quickly
joined
in
and
the
two
shrieked
and
shouted
until
it
seemed
to
them
that
all
the
camps
in
that
region
must
hear
them
but
only
those
who
have
tried
it
know
how
thoroughly
one
may
get
lost
in
the
adirondack
woods
in
a
very
short
time
or
how
loudly
one
may
scream
without
being
heard
even
by
the
friends
who
are
searching
for
them
and
they
were
searching
for
the
lost
girls
when
the
two
failed
to
appear
by
six
and
rose
became
apprehensive
for
their
safety
they
knew
the
girls
had
gone
for
a
long
ramble
in
the
woods
but
it
was
the
rule
of
the
camp
to
be
back
for
six
supper
unless
due
notice
had
been
given
they
lost
in
the
woods
rose
declared
and
though
hoping
the
contrary
rose
agreed
with
her
they
had
telephoned
to
all
the
neighbouring
camps
and
as
no
one
had
seen
the
girls
that
afternoon
they
felt
sure
of
what
had
happened
we
must
make
search
parties
said
bob
while
bert
looked
thoroughly
scared
at
the
thought
of
his
sister
danger
it
is
so
awfully
unusual
bert
people
get
lost
in
the
woods
often
do
they
dad
yes
replied
rose
but
it
is
often
our
little
girls
call
up
long
sam
bob
tell
him
to
bring
lanterns
many
of
the
neighbours
volunteered
assistance
and
inside
of
an
hour
there
were
various
search
parties
beating
the
woods
for
the
missing
girls
but
dotty
when
thinking
she
was
walking
toward
home
had
really
been
walking
in
the
opposite
direction
and
the
two
girls
were
much
farther
away
from
camp
than
their
rescuers
thought
for
nothing
doing
said
jack
norris
despondently
as
he
met
bob
and
bert
in
the
woods
then
we
must
keep
at
it
said
bert
anything
is
better
than
giving
up
the
various
searchers
separated
and
came
together
again
they
screamed
and
shouted
they
whistled
and
blew
horns
their
dogs
barked
and
it
seemed
as
if
some
of
these
noises
must
reach
the
girls
ears
and
bring
response
calls
but
there
was
no
success
and
one
by
one
the
neighbours
gave
up
and
went
home
but
rose
and
the
two
boys
with
long
sam
kept
up
the
search
all
through
the
night
they
built
fires
occasionally
but
dared
not
leave
them
and
put
them
out
as
they
went
on
at
last
long
sam
seated
himself
dejectedly
on
a
fallen
log
his
extraordinary
length
of
limb
doubling
up
like
a
jacknife
no
use
he
declared
they
ai
no
livin
use
o
these
woods
any
longer
we
mought
strike
them
girls
in
a
minute
and
then
again
we
mought
run
across
in
a
thousand
years
lord
knows
willin
to
keep
on
but
i
jest
about
tuckered
out
and
i
put
it
to
you
rose
would
it
be
better
to
rest
a
bit
and
then
push
on
perhaps
it
would
sam
and
rose
fingers
worked
nervously
but
i
could
stay
still
i
go
crazy
i
think
i
push
on
and
take
my
chances
yes
and
get
yourself
lost
grumbled
sam
so
we
have
three
to
hunt
o
two
you
are
done
up
sam
said
bert
fayre
kindly
you
stay
here
and
we
three
will
drive
ahead
a
little
wal
i
jest
give
one
more
howl
and
see
if
that
ketches
anythin
long
sam
stood
up
on
a
log
and
gave
a
high
pitched
long
drawn
out
shout
that
seemed
as
if
it
must
penetrate
the
farthest
depths
of
the
forest
now
one
all
together
like
that
he
said
and
the
four
voices
joined
in
a
mighty
shout
and
then
waited
in
breathless
silence
i
heard
sam
cried
out
i
heard
now
all
you
keep
quiet
and
then
sam
voice
rang
out
once
more
in
a
sharp
short
shriek
he
listened
and
then
exclaimed
yep
i
heard
come
on
and
with
long
strides
he
started
anew
into
the
blackness
of
the
woods
the
others
eagerly
followed
they
had
heard
no
sound
but
their
ears
had
not
the
marvellous
acuteness
of
the
adirondack
guide
and
without
a
word
they
hastened
to
keep
up
with
long
sam
pace
sing
out
again
sam
cried
several
times
and
at
last
the
others
could
hear
the
faint
high
shrieks
of
dotty
and
dolly
it
seemed
an
endless
journey
but
at
last
the
search
party
came
upon
the
two
girls
oh
father
and
dotty
threw
herself
into
his
arms
while
bert
made
a
grab
for
dolly
and
bob
danced
around
the
group
in
glee
you
a
nice
pair
observed
long
sam
who
was
no
respecter
of
persons
when
acting
in
his
capacity
of
guide
what
cut
up
such
a
trick
as
this
for
you
might
you
get
lost
now
sam
do
scold
said
dolly
well
knowing
that
the
bluff
chap
was
really
talking
roughly
to
hide
his
glad
emotion
at
the
rescue
you
ought
to
be
scolded
all
the
same
but
i
your
folks
is
so
glad
to
get
you
back
that
they
just
make
the
world
and
all
of
you
and
sam
prognostication
was
verified
following
sam
lead
the
party
trudged
through
the
woods
all
so
jubilant
at
the
happy
ending
to
their
search
that
scolding
was
not
even
thought
of
and
indeed
why
should
it
be
the
girls
had
done
nothing
wrong
unless
perhaps
they
had
wandered
a
little
deeper
into
the
forest
than
it
was
advisable
to
go
without
a
guide
but
dotty
was
positive
it
would
never
happen
again
and
when
they
reached
camp
and
found
rose
and
genie
waiting
for
them
and
a
most
appetising
supper
spread
out
by
maria
the
two
refugees
found
themselves
looked
down
upon
as
heroines
and
were
quite
willing
to
accept
the
rôle
chapter
xvii
surfwood
a
couple
of
days
after
their
forest
experience
the
two
girls
made
ready
to
go
to
the
seashore
secretly
dolly
was
glad
she
had
enjoyed
much
of
her
stay
at
camp
crosstrees
but
she
had
about
concluded
that
roughing
it
was
not
altogether
to
her
taste
she
had
liked
the
gay
parties
round
the
camp
fires
the
swift
trips
and
the
jolly
picnic
feasts
but
she
was
not
enthusiastically
fond
of
long
tramps
up
and
down
mountains
and
the
deprivation
of
many
home
comforts
and
luxuries
she
said
no
word
of
this
to
her
kind
hosts
but
she
welcomed
the
day
that
would
take
her
back
to
her
own
people
and
their
usual
summer
abode
also
there
had
been
really
unpleasant
experiences
from
her
lonely
first
night
to
that
last
awful
night
in
the
woods
and
though
these
things
were
nobody
fault
they
remained
in
dolly
memory
as
decidedly
undesirable
pictures
of
her
mountain
trip
dotty
rose
all
unconscious
of
dolly
secret
feelings
realised
only
that
they
had
had
lots
of
gay
times
together
and
many
occasions
of
rollicking
fun
having
spent
many
summers
at
camp
crosstrees
the
rose
family
had
become
attached
to
the
place
and
always
looked
forward
with
eager
anticipation
to
each
successive
trip
unlike
dolly
bert
fayre
loved
it
all
to
him
roughing
it
was
fun
and
he
cared
nothing
at
all
for
the
city
comforts
that
were
missing
he
tramped
the
woods
and
went
fishing
swimming
and
boating
with
the
same
enjoyment
of
these
sports
that
bob
rose
felt
and
he
was
more
than
delighted
when
rose
invited
him
to
spend
the
rest
of
august
at
the
camp
while
the
girls
went
for
their
two
weeks
at
the
seashore
so
on
the
day
of
departure
dotty
and
dolly
bade
to
their
brothers
and
to
rose
and
genie
and
in
care
of
rose
started
for
new
york
and
thence
down
to
surfwood
a
resort
on
the
new
jersey
coast
where
the
fayre
family
were
staying
at
a
hotel
oh
do
you
just
hate
to
leave
it
exclaimed
dotty
as
the
took
them
swiftly
down
the
lake
you
dear
old
woods
you
lovely
lake
i
sha
see
you
again
till
next
summer
for
as
the
children
must
begin
school
early
in
september
both
families
would
return
to
berwick
in
about
a
fortnight
dolly
did
not
entirely
share
dotty
enthusiasm
but
she
realised
the
wonderful
beauty
of
the
scene
as
she
looked
back
at
the
lake
with
its
wooded
shores
and
hills
rising
to
the
high
mountains
it
splendid
she
said
very
honestly
as
she
gazed
at
the
beautiful
landscape
i
afraid
dot
that
you
wo
have
a
good
time
down
at
surfwood
it
awfully
different
you
know
i
have
a
good
time
if
i
visiting
you
but
you
see
we
were
a
whole
month
later
than
usual
coming
up
here
this
summer
and
now
to
cut
two
weeks
off
the
other
end
makes
an
awfully
short
season
for
dear
old
crosstrees
why
do
they
call
it
surfwood
dolly
are
there
any
woods
there
yes
indeed
not
far
back
from
the
beach
there
are
lots
of
woods
but
all
flat
of
course
no
hills
like
these
well
you
could
expect
mountains
and
seashore
together
i
know
have
lovely
times
there
anyway
i
rather
be
with
you
than
to
stay
up
here
the
girls
had
become
inseparable
friends
and
their
stay
in
camp
together
had
strengthened
the
bonds
and
made
them
even
more
fond
of
each
other
than
they
had
been
as
neighbours
they
were
very
different
but
they
were
learning
to
accept
each
other
differences
and
in
some
ways
they
frequently
influenced
one
another
tastes
or
opinions
old
lake
dolly
called
out
again
as
the
neared
its
dock
we
see
you
next
summer
you
will
come
up
here
again
next
summer
wo
you
dolly
we
see
when
next
summer
comes
returned
dolly
laughing
perhaps
you
wo
like
surfwood
a
bit
and
you
wo
want
to
go
there
next
summer
and
if
you
do
of
course
i
wo
come
up
here
you
look
awfully
well
in
that
new
suit
dotty
hope
i
do
for
it
does
feel
very
good
collar
too
stiff
dotty
wriggled
with
a
feeling
of
discomfort
that
the
first
wearing
of
a
new
garment
often
brings
the
girls
both
wore
suits
of
blue
serge
made
similarly
but
not
exactly
alike
dotty
being
trimmed
with
black
satin
and
collar
and
cuffs
of
fine
white
embroidery
while
dotty
was
enlivened
by
accessories
of
bright
plaid
silk
and
tiny
gilt
buttons
the
trip
was
a
pleasant
one
and
they
reached
new
york
next
morning
in
time
for
luncheon
this
rose
gave
them
at
an
attractive
restaurant
and
the
girls
greatly
enjoyed
the
novel
scenes
of
the
metropolis
i
just
love
to
eat
in
a
restaurant
do
you
said
dolly
as
she
lingered
over
her
elaborate
and
complicated
dessert
yes
indeed
i
love
to
look
around
and
wonder
who
the
people
are
only
they
all
grownups
you
do
see
hardly
any
children
or
girls
our
age
no
said
rose
a
public
restaurant
is
no
place
for
kiddies
except
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
when
i
have
to
feed
you
somewhere
but
since
you
here
you
may
as
well
enjoy
yourselves
do
you
want
some
more
little
cakes
after
due
reflection
the
girls
concluded
that
they
did
and
the
fascinating
tray
of
french
confections
was
again
offered
for
their
selection
at
the
station
where
they
were
to
take
the
train
for
surfwood
fayre
met
them
well
he
exclaimed
so
i
am
to
take
the
responsibility
of
these
two
beautiful
young
ladies
yes
rejoined
rose
but
i
glad
to
tell
you
that
they
are
not
really
difficult
to
manage
they
have
behaved
most
properly
all
day
and
honestly
i
hate
to
give
them
up
i
know
camp
crosstrees
will
seem
deserted
and
desolate
without
these
two
little
rays
of
sunshine
after
affectionate
leavetakings
rose
departed
and
the
two
girls
went
on
with
fayre
he
was
not
of
such
a
jolly
nature
as
rose
nor
so
inclined
to
talk
with
the
children
he
placed
them
in
adjoining
chairs
in
the
parlour
car
and
after
supplying
them
with
picture
papers
and
candies
he
seemed
to
consider
his
responsibilities
at
an
end
and
taking
his
own
seat
immediately
buried
himself
in
his
newspaper
not
much
like
the
adirondacks
is
it
said
dolly
as
they
whirled
along
through
the
flat
landscapes
of
new
jersey
no
of
course
not
you
would
expect
it
how
soon
do
we
see
the
ocean
very
soon
now
we
get
to
surfwood
about
six
but
we
see
the
ocean
long
before
then
there
are
so
many
beach
stations
as
they
neared
surfwood
fayre
threw
aside
his
papers
and
looked
out
for
the
girls
again
he
was
a
most
courteous
man
and
politely
assisted
them
with
their
various
belongings
treating
them
more
as
grown
ladies
than
as
children
there
they
are
he
cried
as
the
train
stopped
at
the
picturesque
little
station
and
they
spied
a
big
motor
car
in
which
fayre
and
trudy
were
sitting
trudy
was
looking
lovely
in
her
light
summer
costume
and
she
warmly
welcomed
the
travellers
as
they
got
into
the
motor
how
brown
you
both
are
said
fayre
kissing
the
girls
a
nice
healthy
tan
and
very
becoming
did
you
hate
to
leave
your
camp
dotty
and
i
suppose
you
too
dolly
became
a
devotee
of
mountain
life
we
did
have
lovely
times
mother
and
i
expect
dot
was
sorry
to
give
it
up
but
i
persuaded
her
you
have
lovely
times
here
too
promised
trudy
smiling
at
them
i
see
to
that
the
car
stopped
at
the
entrance
to
a
very
large
hotel
the
broad
verandas
were
filled
with
people
gaily
dressed
and
gathered
in
laughing
chatting
groups
between
them
and
the
ocean
was
a
broad
boardwalk
also
filled
with
people
come
along
girls
said
fayre
and
dotty
and
dolly
followed
her
across
the
veranda
and
into
a
large
entrance
hall
it
was
very
beautiful
with
glistening
white
and
gold
decorations
a
thick
velvet
carpet
and
tall
palms
round
the
walls
then
followed
a
bewildering
succession
of
gorgeous
rooms
and
finally
they
went
up
in
an
elevator
here
we
are
and
fayre
led
the
two
girls
into
a
large
and
handsomely
furnished
suite
this
is
our
general
sitting
room
she
went
on
and
this
is
your
bedroom
right
next
to
trudy
they
entered
a
large
room
with
two
brass
beds
and
attractive
appointments
of
all
sorts
the
chairs
and
lounges
were
covered
with
gay
chintz
and
there
was
a
long
deep
window
seat
from
which
across
a
balcony
filled
with
flowers
they
could
see
the
ocean
how
perfectly
lovely
cried
dotty
not
much
like
our
little
rooms
at
camp
doll
oh
i
sure
i
shall
be
very
happy
here
it
awfully
kind
of
you
fayre
to
invite
me
i
very
glad
to
have
you
dear
and
i
only
hope
you
enjoy
it
as
much
as
dolly
did
her
stay
with
you
we
ca
give
you
the
wild
free
life
of
a
mountain
camp
but
we
going
to
do
all
we
can
to
interest
and
amuse
you
but
i
not
sure
that
you
will
like
the
plan
for
this
evening
as
your
things
are
unpacked
i
thought
you
two
would
dine
downstairs
with
us
but
would
have
a
nice
little
dinner
sent
up
here
and
served
in
the
oh
goody
cried
dolly
that
a
lot
more
fun
i
do
feel
like
dressing
up
for
dinner
and
i
think
that
a
lovely
plan
you
dot
as
a
matter
of
fact
dotty
would
have
preferred
to
go
downstairs
for
she
was
impatient
to
see
more
of
the
big
hotel
and
the
gay
people
but
she
politely
acquiesced
and
fayre
bustled
away
saying
she
would
see
them
again
after
dinner
now
we
have
a
lovely
time
dotsy
all
to
ourselves
dolly
said
as
she
flew
around
the
room
arranging
things
to
suit
herself
a
trim
maid
appeared
to
assist
in
any
way
needed
and
the
girls
were
glad
to
change
their
travelling
clothes
and
after
a
refreshing
bath
to
don
their
pretty
kimonos
and
boudoir
caps
that
trudy
had
left
in
readiness
for
them
trudy
a
trump
cried
dolly
see
these
heavenly
things
she
has
laid
out
for
us
a
pink
silk
for
you
and
a
blue
one
for
me
with
caps
to
match
we
share
trudy
bathroom
you
see
so
you
can
have
this
glass
shelf
for
your
things
and
i
take
this
one
for
mine
i
guess
that
the
dinner
coming
now
and
then
our
trunks
will
come
and
we
can
put
our
things
away
a
very
attractive
little
dinner
was
served
in
the
and
the
two
girls
sat
down
to
it
with
a
feeling
as
if
they
were
playing
house
we
to
dine
with
the
grownups
after
said
dolly
new
thing
for
me
always
before
i
had
my
supper
in
the
but
mother
says
now
i
fifteen
i
can
always
dine
with
them
unless
they
have
special
company
and
then
we
have
ours
up
here
like
this
is
this
salad
good
perfectly
lovely
but
somehow
i
feel
so
queer
it
such
a
sudden
change
from
the
camp
table
and
maria
dolly
laughed
yes
it
is
different
but
i
like
that
dot
the
sudden
change
i
mean
crosstrees
was
just
right
in
every
way
for
mountain
and
camp
doings
now
this
seashore
stunt
is
altogether
different
but
i
like
this
too
and
i
think
it
nice
for
us
to
have
both
kinds
one
right
after
the
other
so
do
i
said
dotty
as
she
contentedly
ate
her
frozen
pudding
chapter
xviii
doll
overboard
the
next
morning
dotty
and
dolly
went
with
the
fayre
family
to
breakfast
in
the
hotel
very
fresh
and
pretty
the
girls
looked
dolly
in
a
pale
blue
linen
and
dotty
in
pink
linen
with
a
black
velvet
belt
the
great
was
large
and
airy
and
the
sunshine
and
sea
breeze
came
in
at
the
open
windows
the
fayres
table
was
pleasantly
placed
overlooking
the
ocean
and
dotty
black
eyes
roved
round
the
room
in
delighted
appreciation
of
the
surroundings
oh
she
exclaimed
suddenly
there
are
the
twin
browns
did
you
know
they
were
here
dolly
i
thought
they
would
be
they
come
here
every
summer
and
dolly
smiled
across
the
room
at
tod
and
tad
who
bobbed
their
heads
and
grinned
in
response
i
glad
they
here
dolly
went
on
it
so
nice
to
have
some
one
you
know
to
start
you
getting
acquainted
it
wo
take
you
long
to
get
acquainted
said
trudy
smiling
for
all
the
children
of
your
age
who
are
here
are
waiting
for
you
i
told
several
that
you
were
coming
and
i
expect
the
brown
boys
have
made
all
sorts
of
plans
for
your
entertainment
we
wo
bathe
until
after
luncheon
you
can
spend
the
morning
on
the
beach
or
go
for
a
motor
ride
with
me
whichever
you
like
as
the
girls
hesitated
over
their
decision
the
brown
twins
came
over
to
their
table
and
greeted
them
gaily
thought
you
girls
would
never
get
here
said
tod
though
really
it
mattered
little
which
of
them
spoke
for
they
were
so
precisely
alike
it
was
impossible
to
tell
them
apart
jolly
to
see
you
again
said
tad
do
come
out
on
the
beach
with
us
as
soon
as
you
finish
your
breakfast
wo
you
yes
said
dolly
i
guess
we
wo
go
with
you
trude
this
morning
i
want
dotty
to
get
acquainted
with
the
ocean
and
so
when
the
girls
left
the
they
found
not
only
the
browns
but
several
other
young
people
waiting
on
the
veranda
to
escort
them
down
to
the
beach
there
were
general
introductions
and
as
they
went
down
the
long
flight
of
the
hotel
steps
dolly
found
herself
walking
beside
a
girl
named
pauline
clifton
pauline
was
rather
tall
and
seemed
to
have
an
air
of
authority
though
not
exactly
pretty
she
was
with
brown
eyes
and
hair
and
a
complexion
of
rosy
tan
she
wore
a
white
dress
and
a
red
sweater
and
white
stockings
with
red
shoes
and
she
put
her
hand
through
arm
with
a
decided
air
of
possession
i
like
you
already
she
said
and
i
sure
we
going
to
be
chums
are
you
rich
the
question
struck
dolly
as
funny
and
she
turned
to
look
into
pauline
face
but
the
brown
eyes
were
serious
and
evidently
the
clifton
girl
wished
an
answer
and
was
prepared
to
rate
her
new
friend
accordingly
no
said
dolly
returning
the
frank
gaze
we
not
rich
we
live
in
a
small
town
and
we
have
about
everything
we
want
but
i
sure
not
what
you
call
rich
are
you
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
dolly
to
ask
this
question
but
it
seemed
to
follow
naturally
after
the
other
oh
yes
pauline
said
we
awfully
rich
we
live
in
new
york
and
my
father
has
a
yacht
and

your
own
summer
home
then
and
not
come
to
a
hotel
we
have
two
of
them
one
on
long
island
and
one
up
in
the
mountains
but
father
takes
freaks
i
have
any
mother
and
he
jumps
around
wherever
he
feels
like
it
so
he
picked
this
place
for
august
and

we
are
there
only

that

pretty
too
and
you
two
look
lovely
together
pauline
rattled
on
scarcely
giving
dolly
a
chance
to
reply
to
her
observations
meantime
the
group
had
come
to
a
standstill
and
were
selecting
a
nice
place
on
the
beach
to
spend
the
morning
hours
dotty
was
enchanted
with
her
first
real
experience
of
the
seashore
she
sat
down
in
the
sand
with
the
rest
but
quickly
made
her
way
to
the
front
of
the
group
and
as
near
as
possible
to
the
edge
of
the
waves
in
her
effort
to
get
an
unobstructed
view
of
the
ocean
the
surf
was
rolling
in
and
the
great
breakers
filled
her
with
awe
and
delight
come
farther
back
dotty
tad
brown
called
out
or
you
get
caught
by
some
of
those
swells
dotty
drew
back
just
in
time
to
escape
a
wetting
from
a
big
wave
whose
white
foam
rolled
up
the
sands
to
her
very
feet
is
it
wonderful
she
cried
i
could
sit
right
here
all
day
and
never
take
my
eyes
off
those
waves
but
the
sight
was
not
so
novel
to
the
others
and
they
talked
and
laughed
and
threw
sand
at
each
other
and
built
forts
and
watched
for
passing
steamers
and
made
plans
for
future
amusements
that
the
worst
of
the
seashore
said
pauline
discontentedly
there
so
little
to
do
just
walk
the
boardwalk
or
sit
on
the
sand
or
bathe
that
about
all
nonsense
polly
said
her
brother
carroll
there
lots
else
to
do
going
motoring
or
walking
in
the
woods
and
there
a
bowling
alley
at
the
hotel
and
tennis
courts
there
millions
of
things
to
do
only
you
such
an
old
grouch
you
never
see
the
fun
of
anything
pauline
paid
no
attention
to
this
brotherly
remark
but
said
to
dotty
come
on
let
go
for
a
walk
i
want
to
get
acquainted
with
you
get
acquainted
here
said
dotty
laughing
i
too
comfortable
to
move
the
brown
boys
had
banked
up
a
big
hill
of
sand
behind
dotty
and
she
leaned
back
against
it
still
fascinated
by
the
wonderful
blue
of
the
distant
ocean
sparkling
in
the
sunlight
and
the
mad
onrush
of
the
great
breakers
as
they
dashed
on
the
shore
then
you
come
said
pauline
to
dolly
let
go
off
by
ourselves
and
walk
along
toward
the
casino
and
the
shops
all
right
said
dolly
who
was
tired
of
sitting
on
the
sand
and
quite
ready
for
a
walk
moreover
she
was
curious
to
know
more
of
pauline
she
was
sure
she
should
like
a
girl
who
asked
her
point
blank
if
she
were
rich
and
yet
pauline
did
seem
ostentatious
or
vulgar
but
was
and
full
of
fun
the
two
walked
away
leaving
the
rest
of
the
crowd
some
six
or
eight
of
them
on
the
beach
as
the
morning
passed
others
joined
the
group
and
some
went
away
but
dotty
remained
still
unable
to
tear
herself
away
from
the
glorious
sea
i
say
dot
rose
tod
brown
exclaimed
you
stuck
on
that
big
pond
are
you
but
there
are
other
days
coming
when
you
can
gaze
at
it
come
on
now
and
let
do
something
i
race
you
to
the
end
of
boardwalk
what
there
when
you
get
to
the
end
demanded
dotty
nothing
much
but
some
fishermen
shacks
and
nets
and
things
come
on
and
see
it
the
fishermen
are
a
bunch
and
not
very
but
it
fun
to
tease
them
come
on
anyhow
dotty
got
up
somewhat
cramped
by
long
sitting
and
was
glad
after
all
for
a
brisk
walk
in
the
sunshine
they
did
race
but
swung
along
at
a
good
pace
dotty
with
her
eyes
still
seaward
nearly
at
the
end
of
the
boardwalk
on
a
bench
was
a
large
and
handsome
french
doll
it
was
dressed
as
a
baby
with
a
long
white
frock
a
lacy
cap
and
a
knitted
pink
sacque
oh
look
at
that
cried
dotty
i
know
whose
it
is
it
belongs
to
that
little
child
at
the
hotel
that
so
said
tod
the
kiddy
must
have
left
it
here
i
saw
her
lugging
it
around
this
morning
and
it
was
about
all
she
could
do
to
carry
it
shall
we
take
it
back
to
her
yes
said
dotty
i
just
as
lieve
carry
it
you
bet
you
carry
it
if
either
of
us
does
do
you
i
go
round
lugging
a
wax
infant
it
is
wax
said
dotty
picking
it
up
it
light
as
a
feather
it
one
of
those
celluloid
things
but
i
never
saw
such
a
big
one
before
yes
i
take
it
back
to
little
yellowtop
if
it
left
here
somebody
will
steal
it
shall
we
turn
back
now
no
come
on
to
the
end
of
the
walk
and
let
have
a
look
at
the
fishermen
they
went
on
and
soon
reached
their
destination
it
was
a
picturesque
place
but
the
cabins
were
deserted
and
only
a
few
empty
boats
were
in
sight
the
beach
was
littered
with
old
fish
nets
and
various
sorts
of
rubbish
while
a
few
piers
ran
out
into
the
sea
everybody
gone
fishing
said
tod
nothing
much
to
see
here
go
back
let
go
out
to
the
end
of
that
pier
said
dotty
there
no
danger
is
there
danger
no
but
nothing
to
see
out
there
come
along
though
if
you
like
tod
went
with
dotty
along
the
old
pier
reaching
the
very
end
they
sat
down
for
a
few
moments
their
feet
hanging
over
the
edge
while
they
clung
to
the
uprights
oh
is
it
grand
cried
dotty
looking
down
into
the
blue
water
as
it
rippled
against
the
piles
at
some
distance
below
do
fall
in
warned
tod
never
fear
i
not
that
kind
of
a
goose
i
love
it
but
i
scared
to
death
all
the
time
and
i
keep
a
good
grip
on
this
rope
that
right
oh
here
comes
a
see
out
there
in
the
distance
we
wait
for
that
to
get
in
and
then
we
go
the
two
stood
up
and
hanging
onto
the
ropes
leaned
far
over
to
see
the
boat
as
it
came
in
a
sudden
breeze
made
dotty
cling
closer
to
the
upright
she
was
leaning
against
and
as
tod
put
out
his
hand
to
steady
her
somehow
or
other
the
big
doll
dropped
into
the
water
oh
my
goodness
exclaimed
dotty
in
dismay
there
goes
the
doll
what
a
pity
can
we
get
it
tod
i
do
know
if
it
does
drift
the
wrong
way
maybe
the
fishermen
will
pick
it
up
as
they
come
in
if
i
had
a
hook
and
line
i
could
hook
it
up
do
lean
over
so
far
tod
you
fall
in
and
dotty
tried
to
hold
back
the
boy
as
he
leaned
over
the
edge
of
the
pier
oh
see
there
a
fisherman
or
somebody
coming
out
of
that
cabin
maybe
he
bring
a
pole
or
something
and
help
us
get
the
doll
ask
him
to
tod
shouted
at
the
man
who
had
just
appeared
in
the
cabin
door
it
was
some
distance
and
the
boy
voice
did
not
carry
well
over
the
breakers
between
them
but
finally
tod
succeeded
in
attracting
the
attention
bring
a
pole
tod
shouted
or
fish
line
help
us
hey
shouted
the
man
his
hand
to
his
ear
what
the
matter
doll
overboard
tod
yelled
back
but
the
breeze
was
off
shore
and
the
man
could
not
get
the
words
but
he
saw
the
two
children
as
they
pointed
out
on
the
water
and
then
as
he
saw
the
big
doll
he
very
naturally
thought
it
was
a
live
baby
and
immediately
he
became
excited
he
ran
back
into
the
cabin
and
returned
with
a
he
jumped
into
a
boat
and
endeavoured
to
put
out
to
sea
through
the
breakers
but
at
every
attempt
the
waves
dashed
him
back
on
the
shore
determinedly
he
tried
again
and
again
and
finally
succeeded
in
getting
beyond
the
surf
though
he
was
now
at
some
distance
from
the
pier
he
began
to
row
desperately
but
made
little
headway
toward
the
floating
doll
he
thinks
it
a
live
baby
cried
tod
roaring
with
laughter
oh
dotty
what
a
joke
keep
it
up
pretend
it
is
willingly
enough
dotty
caught
at
the
idea
and
began
wringing
her
hands
and
screaming
frantically
oh
save
her
save
her
she
yelled
tearing
around
the
pier
like
a
mad
person
while
tod
hanging
on
to
a
post
leaned
far
over
the
water
and
waved
his
hand
frantically
to
the
boatman
the
fisherman
redoubled
his
efforts
and
slowly
drew
nearer
the
floating
doll
whose
long
white
dress
was
whirled
and
tossed
about
in
the
eddy
the
boatload
of
fishermen
which
they
had
seen
in
the
distance
drew
nearer
and
the
man
in
the
communicated
to
them
by
shouts
and
signs
and
made
them
aware
of
the
catastrophe
the
incoming
fishermen
saw
the
baby
in
the
water
and
saw
the
two
children
screaming
and
wailing
on
the
pier
and
they
put
forward
with
all
speed
to
make
a
rescue
tod
and
dotty
were
really
doubled
up
with
laughter
but
pretended
they
were
in
agonies
of
grief
as
the
two
boats
made
desperate
attempts
to
reach
the
drowning
child
the
old
idiots
exclaimed
tod
they
might
know
that
a
live
baby
would
float
around
like
that
it
would
have
sunk
long
ago
of
course
it
would
agreed
dotty
wo
they
be
mad
when
they
get
it
the
fishermen
having
had
little
experience
with
french
dolls
the
size
of
live
babies
assumed
of
course
that
it
was
a
real
child
in
the
water
and
they
wasted
no
time
in
marvelling
as
to
why
it
should
continue
to
ride
blithely
on
top
of
the
waves
they
simply
put
forth
every
effort
to
reach
the
white
object
whatever
it
might
be
but
the
perversity
of
wind
and
wave
continued
to
thwart
them
at
last
however
very
near
shore
the
fishermen
drew
near
enough
to
grab
the
doll
and
draw
it
into
their
boat
just
as
they
rowed
in
on
top
of
a
huge
breaker
and
beached
near
the
pier
tod
and
dotty
ran
swiftly
to
them
eager
to
see
their
chagrin
and
dismay
at
having
rescued
the
doll
the
men
were
all
out
on
the
beach
and
they
showed
a
belligerent
demeanour
as
the
children
appeared
ye
little
wretches
cried
one
big
rawboned
man
what
d
mean
by
foolin
us
like
that
his
manner
even
more
than
his
words
were
distinctly
threatening
and
dotty
was
scared
but
tod
answered
him
directly
we
did
fool
you
we
dropped
the
doll
in
the
water
by
accident
and
we
sung
out
there
was
a
doll
overboard
and
we
asked
a
man
on
shore
to
help
us
get
it
if
you
people
thought
it
was
a
live
baby
that
is
our
fault
that
do
go
down
and
another
man
stepped
forward
and
shook
his
fist
at
the
children
ye
know
right
well
ye
fooled
us
we
did
not
and
dotty
her
temper
now
aroused
stamped
her
foot
at
him
we
told
the
man
it
was
a
doll
but
if
he
could
hear
us
we
could
help
that
now
now
little
lady
ye
know
better
the
big
brawny
fisherman
came
nearer
to
dotty
and
scowled
at
her
i
seen
you
jumping
around
there
and
like
you
was
wild
with
grief
do
deny
it
now
ye
know
well
enough
i
say
true
he
glowered
at
dotty
and
as
he
came
nearer
to
her
his
big
fierce
eyes
frightened
her
and
she
quickly
stepped
behind
tod
do
you
speak
to
the
lady
like
that
the
boy
cried
if
anything
to
say
say
it
to
me
i
called
to
the
man
for
help
to
get
that
doll
out
of
the
water
it
belongs
to
a
little
friend
of
ours
and
we
want
to
take
it
to
her
well
ye
never
take
it
and
the
man
picked
up
the
wet
and
dripping
doll
and
with
a
mighty
sweep
of
his
long
arm
he
flung
it
far
out
to
sea
the
deed
was
merely
an
impulse
of
his
angry
wrath
at
having
been
fooled
by
the
children
and
he
faced
them
with
a
defiant
air
you
had
no
right
to
do
that
cried
tod
go
right
out
in
your
boat
and
get
it
ha
ha
laughed
the
man
with
a
loud
boisterous
chuckle
go
out
and
get
it
is
it
not
much
i
not
go
out
and
get
it
and
what
more
i
report
you
two
to
the
station
people
and
i
have
you
arrested
for
false
pretences
tod
was
pretty
sure
that
this
was
all
a
bluff
but
the
other
men
gathered
about
and
promised
the
same
thing
so
threatening
were
they
that
dotty
was
thoroughly
scared
and
tod
though
not
really
afraid
of
arrest
began
to
think
that
these
men
could
make
things
very
unpleasant
for
them
he
knew
by
hearsay
of
the
rough
manners
and
ugly
tempers
of
this
particular
lot
of
fishermen
he
had
heard
stories
of
their
dislike
for
the
summer
guests
who
sometimes
visited
them
out
of
curiosity
and
looked
upon
them
patronisingly
tod
realised
that
nothing
incensed
their
rough
natures
like
being
made
the
subject
of
a
practical
joke
and
this
though
unpremeditatedly
he
and
dotty
had
done
he
thought
best
to
drop
his
indignant
air
and
try
to
propitiate
them
oh
come
now
he
said
honest
injun
as
man
to
man
i
did
mean
to
fool
you
we
dropped
the
doll
in
the
water
and
i
yelled
for
help
now
i
own
up
that
when
you
fellows
seemed
to
think
it
was
a
live
baby
we
did
kind
of
help
along
a
little
but
we
did
mean
any
harm
i
give
you
a
dollar
to
forget
it
tod
spoke
in
a
frank
and
manly
way
and
his
face
ought
to
have
evoked
a
pleasant
response
and
it
did
from
most
of
the
men
but
the
fierce
one
who
seemed
to
be
the
leader
was
possessed
of
a
sense
of
greed
and
his
one
idea
regarding
the
summer
people
was
to
extract
money
from
them
whenever
possible
a
dollar
he
said
with
an
unpleasant
sneer
not
enough
young
sir
show
us
ten
dollars
and
we
try
to
forget
the
insult
you
offered
us
i
did
offer
you
an
insult
and
i
have
ten
dollars
with
me
and
i
would
pay
it
to
you
if
i
had
tod
was
angry
now
and
his
eyes
blazed
at
the
rude
injustice
of
the
demand
but
the
man
was
not
abashed
you
gim
me
ten
dollars
or
i
make
trouble
for
you
if
you
have
got
it
you
can
get
it
gim
me
your
word
of
honour
you
look
like
a
gentleman
to
bring
me
that
ten
and
i
promise
to
make
no
trouble
tod
hesitated
had
he
been
alone
he
would
have
refused
them
at
once
but
he
felt
that
he
had
the
responsibility
of
dotty
welfare
and
he
paused
to
reflect
the
men
were
very
rude
and
uncontrolled
and
tod
did
know
what
further
menace
they
might
offer
as
he
hesitated
the
big
man
spoke
more
threateningly
be
quick
young
man
give
us
your
word
or
we
put
you
under
lock
and
key
for
awhile
to
think
it
over
this
speech
was
accompanied
by
growls
of
assent
from
other
members
of
the
group
and
one
or
two
stepped
forward
as
if
to
carry
out
the
suggestion
chapter
xix
spending
the
prize
money
hoo
hoo
called
a
gay
voice
and
tod
and
dotty
turned
to
see
dolly
fayre
flying
toward
them
she
was
alone
and
out
of
breath
from
running
but
laughing
gaily
as
she
joined
them
i
ran
away
from
tad
she
cried
he
went
to
get
some
candy
and
just
for
fun
i
scooted
off
and
somebody
had
said
you
came
this
way
dot
so
i
followed
just
for
fun
why
what
the
matter
dolly
looked
in
amazement
at
the
group
of
angry
men
and
at
the
faces
of
dotty
and
tod
matter
enough
tod
said
you
keep
out
of
it
dolly
in
fact
you
girls
go
back
to
the
hotel
and
leave
me
to
fix
things
up
with
these
men
then
he
suddenly
remembered
his
desire
for
an
amicable
settlement
and
he
said
pleasantly
i
guess
we
can
come
to
terms
after
the
ladies
have
gone
i
guess
we
ca
said
the
man
in
a
surly
tone
you
go
back
to
the
hotel
young
man
and
get
that
ten
dollars
and
i
keep
the
young
ladies
here
safe
until
you
come
back
not
much
i
wo
cried
tod
angrily
run
on
back
girls
go
on
beat
it
no
you
do
and
the
big
man
stepped
forward
and
laid
his
hand
on
dotty
shoulder
take
your
hand
off
that
lady
do
you
dare
to
touch
her
and
eyes
blazed
as
he
flung
himself
toward
the
big
man
what
is
it
all
about
what
is
the
matter
exclaimed
dolly
who
could
understand
what
she
had
supposed
was
a
chat
with
the
fishermen
they
want
us
to
pay
ten
dollars
said
dotty
indignantly
and
unless
we
do
they
going
to
lock
us
up
lock
us
up
nothing
shouted
tod
who
was
unable
to
decide
himself
what
was
the
best
thing
to
do
the
arrival
of
dolly
had
complicated
his
dilemma
for
now
he
had
two
girls
to
protect
instead
of
one
he
wished
tad
had
come
with
her
for
the
twins
were
big
and
brawny
for
their
years
and
could
have
made
a
fair
showing
of
rebellion
against
the
injustice
of
the
fishermen
dolly
considered
the
matter
gravely
she
looked
from
dotty
and
tod
to
the
rude
unkempt
men
and
after
a
few
moments
thought
she
made
up
her
mind
deliberately
she
opened
a
little
chatelaine
bag
that
hung
at
her
belt
and
took
from
it
a
ten
dollar
gold
piece
it
was
her
share
of
the
cake
prize
for
rose
had
changed
the
twenty
dollar
gold
piece
into
two
tens
for
the
girls
she
looked
at
the
big
man
with
scorn
and
holding
out
the
gold
piece
she
said
in
cool
haughty
tones
here
is
your
money
please
do
not
detain
my
friends
any
longer
do
you
do
it
dolly
cried
tod
it
an
outrage
i
know
it
an
outrage
dolly
said
calmly
but
i
prefer
to
pay
the
money
rather
than
parley
with
these
people
dolly
air
of
superiority
would
have
been
funny
had
not
all
concerned
been
so
deeply
in
earnest
said
the
big
ugly
man
you
a
fine
young
miss
you
are
you
treat
us
like
the
dirt
under
your
feet
do
you
well
if
so
be
you
pay
our
claim
we
ai
objectin
to
your
manner
be
as
high
and
mighty
as
you
like
but
give
us
that
there
coin
without
a
further
word
dolly
dropped
the
gold
piece
into
the
grimy
outstretched
hand
and
the
three
turned
and
walked
away
back
to
civilisation
i
up
and
down
sorry
that
i
could
get
you
out
of
that
mess
better
said
tod
as
they
went
along
the
boardwalk
of
course
i
pay
you
back
the
money
dolly
only
i
felt
mighty
cheap
to
have
you
advance
it
but
i
had
only
three
or
four
dollars
with
me
not
expecting
a
this
morning
i
do
think
you
ought
to
have
paid
it
doll
said
dotty
is
a
question
of
ought
to
said
tod
seriously
that
a
rough
bad
gang
i
heard
of
them
before
i
do
know
what
the
matter
with
them
but
they
grouchy
all
the
other
fishermen
around
here
are
fairly
but
this
lot
is
noted
for
ugly
temper
and
they
especially
dislike
and
resent
the
summer
people
i
forgot
all
this
and
of
course
dotty
did
know
it
but
i
did
think
and
when
they
supposed
the
baby
was
alive
i
went
ahead
with
the
game
without
realising
it
meant
trouble
well
it
all
right
now
said
dolly
and
i
was
glad
enough
to
give
up
my
ten
to
ransom
you
two
captives
of
course
you
wo
pay
it
back
to
me
tod
but
you
can
each
pay
me
a
third
of
it
and
that
square
us
all
up
we
each
pay
half
said
dotty
there
no
reason
you
should
pay
anything
doll
you
were
in
on
this
game
and
here
another
thing
i
going
to
buy
a
new
doll
for
that
little
girl
you
see
it
the
same
as
if
i
stole
hers
not
at
all
said
tod
she
had
lost
her
doll
anyhow
she
must
have
left
it
there
on
the
bench
and
if
we
had
picked
it
up
somebody
would
have
stolen
it
sooner
or
later
we
ca
be
sure
of
that
said
dotty
and
anyway
i
took
her
doll
and
i
lost
it
for
her
and
it
up
to
me
to
get
her
another
and
that
all
there
is
about
that
i
got
my
gold
piece
with
me
too
and
i
going
straight
down
to
the
shop
and
get
the
doll
now
dotty
was
determined
and
so
the
three
went
to
the
shop
there
was
only
one
place
in
surfwood
where
toys
and
fancy
goods
were
sold
but
this
shop
was
stocked
with
a
high
grade
of
goods
and
dotty
had
no
trouble
in
finding
a
doll
nearly
like
the
one
which
was
now
doubtless
afloat
on
the
wide
ocean
the
doll
cost
five
dollars
but
dotty
persisted
in
buying
it
as
she
declared
her
conscience
would
never
be
easy
unless
she
did
now
let
settle
this
thing
up
said
tod
as
they
emerged
from
the
store
i
find
i
have
as
much
as
five
dollars
with
me
counting
chicken
feed
and
i
pay
this
to
you
dolly
as
my
half
of
the
ransom
you
put
up
and
here
my
five
said
dotty
handing
over
the
bill
she
had
received
in
change
for
the
doll
dolly
looked
dismayed
why
good
gracious
dot
then
here
am
i
with
ten
dollars
and
you
with
nothing
of
our
prize
money
i
wo
stand
that
for
a
minute
you
take
this
five
back
and
then
we
be
even
all
round
i
rather
guess
if
you
get
in
a
scrape
like
that
i
got
a
right
to
help
you
out
well
i
rather
guess
said
tod
that
when
we
tell
our
folks
about
this
matter
there
be
something
doing
i
think
those
men
ought
to
be
shown
up
and
punished
oh
no
said
dolly
they
an
awful
gang
i
heard
father
say
so
and
i
sure
it
better
to
let
them
alone
than
to
stir
up
any
further
trouble
and
as
it
turned
out
the
elders
concerned
in
the
matter
shared
opinion
the
story
was
told
and
fayre
and
brown
talked
over
the
matter
and
said
they
would
take
it
in
charge
and
the
children
need
think
no
more
about
it
but
they
were
directed
to
keep
away
from
that
locality
in
the
future
and
confine
their
escapades
to
such
portions
of
the
beach
and
the
boardwalk
as
were
inhabited
by
civilised
crowds
money
matters
were
straightened
out
in
a
way
acceptable
to
all
concerned
by
the
simple
method
of
the
two
fathers
remuneration
of
all
that
had
been
paid
out
and
so
dolly
dotty
and
tod
found
themselves
possessed
of
the
same
finances
they
had
before
the
unfortunate
episode
occurred
dat
not
my
dolly
declared
the
baby
shaking
her
yellow
curls
as
dotty
offered
her
the
new
doll
i
know
it
dotty
said
smiling
as
she
knelt
beside
the
child
but
let
me
tell
you
i
found
your
dolly
sitting
all
alone
on
a
bench
and
i
was
going
to
bring
her
home
to
you
and
then
well
and
then
do
you
know
that
dolly
went
out
to
sea
way
out
to
sea
and
i
think
she
going
to
europe
as
fast
as
she
can
get
there
and
so
i
brought
you
this
other
dolly
which
is
just
as
pretty
goldenhead
looked
up
into
the
smiling
black
eyes
and
after
a
hesitation
agreed
that
the
new
dolly
was
just
as
pretty
as
the
departed
one
and
graciously
accepted
it
goldenhead
mother
demurred
at
the
whole
transaction
but
fayre
insisted
that
the
child
accept
the
new
dolly
and
so
the
matter
was
settled
tell
me
everything
all
about
it
cried
pauline
clifton
rushing
to
meet
the
two
d
on
the
hotel
veranda
was
it
thrilling
such
an
experience
my
i
wish
i
had
been
with
you
and
tod
brown
was
perfectly
fine
a
real
hero
did
do
a
thing
growled
tod
and
tad
who
was
beside
him
said
wish
i
been
there
then
we
could
have
sent
the
girls
flying
home
and
stood
up
to
those
toughs
are
you
splendid
cried
pauline
but
dolly
said
in
her
practical
way
it
would
have
been
splendid
at
all
it
would
have
been
very
foolish
for
you
two
boys
to
think
of
fighting
that
crowd
of
great
ugly
men
it
was
a
case
where
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
submit
to
their
demand
and
come
away
my
father
says
we
did
just
right
of
course
it
was
the
only
thing
to
do
said
tod
but
to
me
it
seemed
awful
galling
well
we
never
go
there
again
said
dotty
and
it
ought
to
be
a
lesson
to
us
not
to
play
jokes
on
people
a
lesson
that
never
learn
said
dolly
laughing
you
have
to
have
worse
experiences
than
that
dotty
rose
before
you
stop
playing
jokes
on
people
is
that
so
cried
carroll
clifton
then
you
a
girl
after
my
own
heart
i
love
to
play
jokes
let
put
our
heads
together
and
work
up
a
good
one
on
somebody
well
this
joke
is
on
us
anyway
said
dotty
laughing
we
have
our
ten
dollars
back
again
dolly
and
i
say
we
spend
them
before
we
get
a
chance
to
lose
them
again
but
we
going
to
spend
those
for
something
special
you
know
they
are
our
cake
prizes
oho
cried
carroll
did
you
girls
take
a
prize
at
a
cake
walk
not
a
cake
walk
but
we
took
a
prize
for
making
cake
dotty
exclaimed
and
i
say
dolly
let
buy
something
in
that
shop
where
we
bought
the
doll
they
have
beautiful
things
there
of
all
sorts
come
on
said
pauline
let
all
go
and
we
help
you
pick
out
things
so
the
two
cliftons
and
the
two
browns
and
the
two
d
all
started
for
the
shop
it
was
that
sort
of
summer
resort
bazaar
that
holds
all
kinds
of
fancy
for
frivolous
purchasers
going
to
get
things
alike
or
different
asked
tod
brown
as
they
went
in
different
of
course
said
tad
dot
and
dolly
never
like
things
alike
do
you
really
said
pauline
how
funny
i
thought
you
were
such
great
friends
you
always
had
everything
just
alike
no
said
dolly
we
have
everything
just
different
you
see
our
tastes
are
just
about
opposite
i
expect
that
why
we
such
friends
dotty
and
carroll
were
already
studying
the
things
at
the
jewellery
counter
while
dolly
was
slowly
but
surely
making
toward
the
book
department
get
a
picture
suggested
tad
here
are
some
good
water
colours
of
the
sea
and
here
a
coloured
photograph
of
that
very
fishing
place
where
you
were
at
said
pauline
all
sorts
of
ridiculous
suggestions
were
made
and
the
boys
offered
and
comical
toys
to
the
two
spenders
why
do
you
get
a
lot
of
little
things
instead
of
one
big
thing
said
pauline
here
are
some
darling
slipper
buckles
and
i
think
these
little
flower
vases
are
lovely
no
said
dotty
decidedly
we
each
going
to
get
one
thing
and
spend
the
whole
ten
dollars
for
it
and
it
must
be
something
that
we
can
keep
and
use
i
made
up
my
mind
said
dolly
calmly
i
just
looking
around
for
fun
but
i
know
perfectly
well
what
i
going
to
get
do
you
dotty
yes
of
course
i
decided
before
i
was
in
the
store
a
minute
what
chorused
the
others
this
is
mine
and
dotty
went
back
to
the
jewellery
counter
and
pointed
out
a
well
of
all
ridiculous
things
cried
tod
you
might
as
well
have
let
the
fishermen
keep
your
money
is
ridiculous
at
all
dotty
retorted
mother
told
me
i
could
get
exactly
what
i
wanted
and
i
want
this
dreadfully
i
wanted
one
for
a
long
time
do
you
think
it
pretty
pauline
yes
returned
pauline
carelessly
i
have
two
of
them
one
real
gold
and
one
silver
but
i
hardly
ever
carry
them
oh
well
you
can
have
whatever
you
want
said
dotty
but
this
is
a
treat
to
me
and
i
think
it
lovely
though
of
course
not
grand
like
yours
so
dotty
bought
the
and
then
the
crowd
followed
dolly
to
see
what
might
be
her
choice
straight
to
the
bookshelves
she
went
and
pointed
to
a
set
of
fairy
stories
they
were
half
a
dozen
or
more
volumes
bound
in
various
colours
and
the
set
was
ten
dollars
i
been
just
crazy
for
these
books
she
said
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
i
would
have
had
them
for
my
birthday
only
we
had
our
rooms
fixed
up
and
the
minute
i
spotted
them
i
knew
i
should
buy
them
what
a
foolishness
exclaimed
carroll
how
can
you
read
fairy
tales
she
loves
them
said
dotty
she
rather
read
a
fairy
story
than
go
to
a
party
any
day
dolly
laughed
and
dimpled
but
stuck
to
her
decision
and
soon
the
crowd
left
the
shop
carrying
the
important
purchases
with
them
back
at
the
hotel
they
were
exhibited
and
fayre
and
trudy
smiled
a
little
at
the
selection
but
said
they
were
glad
that
the
girls
had
bought
what
they
wanted
chapter
xx
summer
days
at
surfwood
passed
happily
and
swiftly
dolly
and
dotty
often
discussed
the
matter
and
always
agreed
that
camp
life
and
hotel
life
were
equally
pleasant
though
in
opposite
ways
and
if
dotty
sometimes
sighed
for
the
careless
freedom
of
the
life
in
the
woods
or
if
dolly
felt
in
her
secret
heart
that
she
preferred
the
more
formal
conventions
of
the
big
hotel
they
soon
forgot
such
thoughts
in
the
joys
of
the
moment
there
was
seabathing
every
day
and
automobile
trips
and
all
sorts
of
beach
fun
and
frolic
the
time
was
drawing
near
for
them
to
go
back
to
berwick
and
settle
down
again
to
the
routine
of
home
life
among
the
last
of
the
season
gaieties
there
was
to
be
a
dance
in
the
big
this
was
a
regular
summer
feature
and
all
the
guests
of
the
hotel
did
their
best
to
make
the
occasion
attractive
all
under
sixteen
were
considered
children
and
even
some
of
the
little
tots
were
allowed
to
attend
the
festival
fancy
dress
was
not
obligatory
but
many
of
the
young
people
chose
to
wear
gay
costumes
the
two
cliftons
the
brown
twins
and
dolly
and
dotty
had
come
to
be
a
clique
by
themselves
and
were
always
together
let
dress
alike
for
the
silly
party
said
clifford
who
liked
to
appear
scornful
of
such
amusements
but
who
was
really
very
fond
of
them
all
right
how
shall
we
dress
said
dotty
who
was
always
ready
for
dressing
up
a
shepherdess
costume
is
the
prettiest
thing
you
can
wear
said
pauline
i
have
one
with
me
and
it
lovely
you
two
girls
copy
that
and
then
have
the
boys
rig
up
something
like
it
mother
will
make
us
any
old
togs
we
want
said
tad
it
is
a
masquerade
is
it
oh
no
said
dolly
just
fancy
dress
you
know
if
you
choose
and
lots
of
them
just
wear
regular
party
clothes
i
like
to
be
a
shepherdess
all
right
said
tad
with
a
comical
simpering
smile
now
do
you
make
fun
of
my
plan
said
pauline
we
three
girls
can
be
shepherdesses
and
you
three
boys
can
be
shepherds
shepherd
lads
are
lovely
with
pipes
and
things
clay
pipes
asked
tod
no
goosy
pipes
to
play
on
long
ones
with
ribbons
oh
be
lovely
and
pauline
clapped
her
hands
liza
will
make
you
a
suit
carroll
and
then
the
other
boys
can
have
it
copied
there
was
much
further
discussion
and
the
elders
were
called
into
consultation
but
finally
pauline
plan
was
adopted
her
shepherdess
frock
was
dainty
and
beautiful
the
dresden
flowered
overdress
was
of
silk
looped
above
a
quilted
satin
petticoat
and
a
black
velvet
bodice
laced
up
over
a
fine
white
muslin
chemisette
a
broad
brimmed
hat
with
roses
and
a
shepherdess
crook
completed
the
picture
it
perfectly
lovely
pauline
said
trudy
when
she
saw
the
dress
but
we
copy
it
for
the
girls
in
less
expensive
materials
flowered
organdy
will
be
very
pretty
for
the
panniers
and
sateen
or
silkoline
will
do
for
the
skirts
the
hats
can
be
easily
managed
and
i
sure
we
can
get
the
crooks
down
at
the
shop
if
not
dad
will
bring
them
from
new
york
you
a
brick
trudy
and
dotty
flung
her
arms
around
the
girl
it
awful
good
of
you
to
do
mine
as
well
as
dolly
oh
mother
will
help
me
and
it
be
easy
as
anything
i
love
to
do
it
long
suffering
liza
was
accustomed
to
do
as
she
was
told
so
she
set
to
work
to
evolve
a
shepherd
costume
for
carroll
she
was
skilful
with
her
needle
and
out
of
sateen
and
some
gay
ribbons
she
constructed
a
suit
that
was
picturesque
and
jaunty
even
if
not
entirely
the
sort
a
shepherd
lad
might
choose
for
daily
wear
a
soft
white
silk
shirt
with
a
broad
open
collar
and
a
soft
silk
tie
was
very
becoming
to
carroll
and
the
pipes
so
necessary
to
the
character
were
bought
in
new
york
by
carroll
father
brown
was
quite
willing
to
have
this
suit
copied
for
her
twins
and
tod
and
tad
though
growling
at
the
idea
of
being
dressed
up
like
jack
puddings
were
secretly
rather
pleased
with
the
becoming
garb
suppose
we
make
the
caps
for
the
boys
said
pauline
i
know
just
how
and
i
think
be
fun
the
others
agreed
and
the
day
before
the
dance
the
three
girls
a
cosy
corner
of
the
big
veranda
and
sat
down
to
work
copying
a
picture
it
was
not
difficult
to
make
the
type
of
cap
that
would
harmonise
with
the
shepherds
suits
pauline
cut
them
out
and
each
of
the
girls
sewed
one
you
have
made
the
big
enough
pauline
said
dolly
as
she
tried
an
unfinished
cap
on
her
own
curly
head
they
plenty
big
enough
pauline
retorted
the
boys
have
such
a
mop
of
hair
as
you
have
i
know
that
but
even
allowing
for
that
i
do
think
they
could
ever
get
their
heads
into
these
small
bands
where
are
they
let
fit
them
on
them
they
gone
off
for
the
morning
i
tell
you
dolly
these
bands
are
all
right
do
you
i
know
anything
of
course
i
measured
them
before
i
began
some
people
think
they
know
it
all
pauline
was
and
dolly
was
not
so
the
latter
made
no
response
to
the
somewhat
rude
speech
and
the
girls
sewed
a
few
moments
in
silence
then
as
dotty
began
to
sew
her
cap
to
its
band
she
echoed
words
why
polly
these
bands
are
big
enough
that
so
and
dotty
tried
to
put
the
cap
on
her
own
head
how
silly
you
are
exclaimed
pauline
angrily
do
you
suppose
your
head
with
all
that
hair
is
bigger
than
the
boys
heads
without
any
hair
to
speak
of
i
tell
you
i
measured
these
bands
and
they
plenty
big
enough
if
you
girls
want
to
be
so
disagreeable
about
it
you
can
make
the
caps
yourselves
it
no
use
finishing
these
things
declared
dotty
for
the
boys
ca
get
their
heads
into
them
why
they
hardly
big
enough
for
a
six
year
old
kid
i
tell
you
they
are
i
guess
i
know
i
measured
one
on
my
own
brother
and
his
head
is
just
as
big
as
the
browns
heads
are
you
got
the
yourself
dotty
flashed
back
at
her
you
think
you
know
everything
pauline
clifton
i
just
the
boys
ca
wear
these
caps
but
we
go
on
and
finish
them
since
you
say
they
big
enough
they
big
enough
there
no
reason
why
we
should
finish
them
and
pauline
cheeks
grew
red
as
she
sewed
hurriedly
on
the
cap
she
held
well
do
let
quarrel
about
it
said
dolly
who
had
not
changed
her
opinion
but
who
wanted
to
make
peace
if
pauline
says
they
all
right
dotty
let
go
on
and
sew
them
she
must
know
if
she
measured
carroll
head
of
course
i
know
and
pauline
scowled
at
the
other
two
girls
if
you
sew
instead
of
fussing
and
finding
fault
we
could
get
the
things
done
before
luncheon
all
right
and
dolly
smiled
pleasantly
shaking
her
head
at
dotty
who
was
just
about
to
make
an
angry
speech
if
polly
takes
the
responsibility
i
satisfied
to
go
on
but
it
certainly
does
seem
to
me
that
any
boy
could
get
his
head
into
that
thing
and
she
held
up
a
cap
whose
head
band
certainly
did
seem
small
i
take
the
responsibility
all
right
and
pauline
shook
her
head
angrily
and
when
you
see
the
boys
with
these
caps
on
you
realise
how
silly
you
acted
the
girls
stitched
on
for
a
few
minutes
without
speaking
and
then
dolly
gentle
voice
broke
the
silence
with
some
comment
on
some
other
subject
and
peace
was
restored
outwardly
though
each
of
the
three
was
conscious
of
an
angry
undercurrent
to
their
conversation
the
caps
finished
pauline
took
the
three
of
them
and
said
she
would
give
them
to
liza
who
had
the
ribbon
streamers
for
them
so
the
trio
separated
and
as
the
fayres
had
an
engagement
for
that
afternoon
the
three
girls
were
not
together
again
until
the
next
day
the
next
day
was
the
day
of
the
dance
but
there
was
a
tennis
tournament
in
the
afternoon
in
which
all
the
young
people
took
part
and
so
interested
were
they
in
the
games
that
no
reference
was
made
to
the
quarrel
of
the
day
before
the
dance
was
in
the
evening
and
at
dinner
time
dolly
and
dotty
passed
the
cliftons
table
on
their
way
to
their
own
get
dressed
early
and
come
down
to
the
as
soon
as
you
can
carroll
said
to
them
as
they
went
by
the
party
is
a
short
one
anyway
the
children
dance
was
only
from
eight
till
ten
as
the
more
young
people
claimed
the
floor
later
trudy
helped
dolly
and
dotty
into
their
pretty
dresses
and
both
she
and
fayre
exclaimed
with
admiration
the
costumes
of
organdy
and
sateen
were
quite
as
pretty
as
the
model
of
silk
and
satin
both
girls
wore
their
hair
hanging
in
loose
curls
and
their
broad
hats
had
long
streamers
of
blue
and
pink
ribbon
which
tied
under
the
chin
with
a
bow
at
one
side
their
long
white
crooks
bore
bunches
of
ribbon
and
each
carried
a
little
basket
of
flowers
to
add
to
the
dainty
effect
they
found
the
others
awaiting
them
in
the
and
indeed
the
dancing
was
just
about
to
begin
as
they
arrived
it
was
a
pretty
sight
the
long
handsome
room
was
specially
decorated
with
flowers
and
banners
and
the
gaily
dressed
children
were
laughing
and
running
about
in
glee
many
of
eight
or
nine
were
dancing
in
pretty
fashion
and
indeed
all
ages
under
sixteen
were
represented
this
frolic
was
an
annual
affair
and
the
majority
of
the
children
staying
at
the
hotel
were
allowed
to
attend
perhaps
half
of
them
were
in
fancy
costume
and
fairies
and
red
ridinghoods
flitted
about
with
bobby
shaftos
or
miniature
cavaliers
is
it
beautiful
cried
dotty
at
the
threshold
of
the
she
had
never
seen
a
party
just
like
this
before
and
the
gay
sight
entranced
her
we
ca
go
in
laughed
trudy
as
she
and
her
parents
looked
in
at
the
door
the
room
is
reserved
for
you
kiddies
and
we
can
only
peep
in
at
the
windows
dolly
and
dotty
soon
found
their
friends
and
crossed
the
room
to
join
the
shepherd
clan
pauline
looked
very
lovely
in
her
elaborate
costume
and
the
boys
were
really
fine
as
shepherd
lads
as
the
two
girls
approached
pauline
whispered
to
them
with
an
air
of
triumph
you
see
the
caps
are
plenty
big
enough
and
sure
enough
the
three
boys
wore
their
caps
set
jauntily
on
the
side
of
their
heads
but
without
a
doubt
the
bands
were
amply
large
so
you
see
i
know
something
after
all
pauline
went
on
and
dolly
said
frankly
you
did
polly
you
were
right
and
we
were
wrong
dotty
was
not
quite
so
smilingly
gracious
but
she
had
a
strong
sense
of
justice
and
she
said
they
big
enough
pauline
i
was
mistaken
and
then
the
dancing
began
there
were
only
simple
dances
as
the
children
had
not
mastered
the
intricacies
of
modern
steps
and
there
was
much
fun
and
gay
banter
the
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
danced
first
with
each
other
but
later
others
joined
them
and
the
clan
separated
but
the
last
dance
before
supper
dolly
danced
with
carroll
clifton
at
the
finish
they
sat
for
a
moment
under
some
palms
to
rest
and
carroll
took
off
his
cap
and
held
it
in
his
hand
as
a
matter
of
fact
dolly
had
forgotten
all
about
the
cap
discussion
but
suddenly
her
eyes
fell
on
the
inside
of
the
cap
as
carroll
held
it
carelessly
upside
down
on
his
knee
she
could
hardly
believe
her
eyes
but
she
looked
again
and
sure
enough
she
was
right
a
full
inch
of
material
had
been
let
into
the
band
at
the
back
to
make
it
larger
dolly
stared
at
it
and
then
taking
the
cap
as
if
to
admire
it
she
said
i
wonder
if
this
is
the
one
i
made
you
know
we
girls
made
the
shepherd
caps
and
i
hope
you
duly
grateful
yes
nice
you
are
said
carroll
banteringly
they
were
so
little
we
could
get
them
on
i
told
polly
and
she
gathered
them
in
last
night
and
took
them
up
to
her
room
and
made
them
bigger
i
guess
she
spent
half
the
night
doing
it
for
her
light
was
burning
pretty
late
dolly
said
nothing
but
a
wave
of
indignation
swept
over
her
to
think
pauline
should
so
deceive
her
to
think
she
should
be
so
small
and
petty
as
when
she
found
herself
in
the
wrong
to
secretly
rectify
her
own
mistake
and
then
triumphantly
announce
to
the
girls
that
the
caps
were
big
enough
after
all
of
course
they
were
big
enough
after
she
had
set
a
piece
in
each
one
dolly
smiled
to
herself
to
think
what
an
undertaking
it
must
have
been
for
that
alteration
and
it
was
done
neatly
meant
a
troublesome
bit
of
ripping
and
sewing
carroll
looked
at
her
inquiringly
well
he
said
it
the
one
you
made
you
seem
desperately
interested
in
it
i
do
know
whether
it
the
one
or
not
but
it
does
matter
they
all
alike
put
it
on
carroll
they
all
going
out
to
supper
now
and
it
spoils
your
costume
not
to
wear
it
supper
was
a
gay
feast
it
was
the
one
occasion
of
the
year
when
the
children
were
allowed
in
the
at
night
and
there
were
and
especial
varieties
of
cakes
and
ices
and
jellies
suited
to
juvenile
tastes
after
supper
the
young
guests
were
supposed
to
say
and
the
party
was
over
as
they
went
upstairs
dolly
pulled
dotty
back
beside
her
and
at
the
same
moment
whispered
to
tod
to
let
her
take
his
cap
unnoticed
by
any
one
else
dolly
showed
dotty
the
piecing
inside
and
putting
her
finger
on
her
lip
shook
her
head
as
an
admonition
to
be
silent
then
she
returned
the
cap
to
tod
who
had
noticed
the
incident
especially
and
on
the
upper
landing
of
the
great
staircase
the
children
said
their
gay
and
went
off
to
their
various
apartments
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
said
the
shepherdess
not
waiting
to
take
off
her
fancy
costume
but
pulling
the
shepherdess
down
to
the
beside
her
this
was
the
spot
where
the
girls
sat
nearly
every
night
to
talk
over
the
events
of
the
day
the
wide
seat
with
its
many
pillows
was
cosy
and
comfortable
and
the
view
of
the
ocean
and
the
sound
of
the
rolling
waves
made
these
evening
chats
very
happy
and
confidential
but
i
do
understand
said
dotty
looking
puzzled
you
motioned
for
me
not
to
speak
a
word
so
i
did
but
what
does
it
mean
who
put
that
piece
in
tod
cap
his
mother
no
pauline
did
it
she
sneaked
those
caps
away
to
her
room
last
night
and
sat
up
till
all
hours
piecing
those
pieces
in
and
a
sweet
job
she
must
have
had
of
it
why
it
about
as
much
trouble
to
piece
a
thing
like
that
as
to
make
a
whole
cap
pauline
did
it
still
dotty
could
understand
why
she
said
this
evening
that
the
caps
were
all
right
and
big
enough
of
course
they
were
after
she
pieced
the
bands
out
longer
she
did
it
herself
dotty
and
then
pretended
to
us
that
they
were
just
as
we
had
left
them
at
least
she
meant
us
to
think
that
for
she
said
you
see
they
all
right
and
she
did
tell
us
she
had
fixed
them
how
do
you
know
she
did
it
maybe
brown
or
liza
did
it
carroll
told
me
polly
did
it
herself
after
she
went
to
her
room
last
night
he
says
her
light
was
burning
awful
late
because
she
had
to
fix
the
three
caps
the
deceitful
girl
if
that
is
the
limit
just
wait
till
i
see
her
i
tell
her
what
i
think
of
her
now
dotty
that
just
what
i
do
want
you
to
do
i
knew
how
feel
about
this
thing
and
honest
at
first
i
thought
i
would
tell
you
if
i
had
you
never
would
have
known
but
we
never
do
have
secrets
from
each
other
and
so
when
i
found
it
out
i
thought
i
ought
to
tell
you
but
i
do
want
you
to
quarrel
with
pauline
about
it
wo
you
let
it
go
dot
and
never
say
anything
to
her
on
the
subject
no
i
wo
dolly
she
told
a
story
or
if
she
did
tell
it
right
out
she
made
us
think
what
was
true
and
it
just
the
same
she
ought
to
be
shown
up
tod
and
tad
and
her
own
brother
too
ought
to
know
what
a
mean
thing
she
did
it
only
justice
dolly
that
they
should
you
so
you
forgive
anything
and
forget
it
too
but
i
ca
i
got
to
tell
that
clifton
girl
what
i
think
of
her
oh
i
never
heard
of
such
meanness
why
dollyrinda
fayre
you
or
i
would
scorn
to
do
such
a
thing
of
course
we
would
dot
but
i
do
know
as
it
up
to
us
to
tell
pauline
clifton
what
she
ought
to
do
it
is
that
dolly
we
not
her
teachers
and
i
do
care
what
she
does
to
other
people
but
she
need
think
she
can
do
a
thing
like
that
and
act
as
if
we
did
know
anything
when
we
told
her
she
was
wrong
and
then
when
she
finds
she
is
wrong
to
go
and
fix
it
up
on
the
sly
and
pretend
she
was
right
all
along
i
wo
stand
for
it
i
show
her
up
in
all
her
meanness
and
deceit
and
i
do
it
before
the
boys
too
she
ought
to
be
made
to
feel
cheap
the
idea
dolly
waited
in
silence
until
dotty
wrath
had
spent
itself
she
had
known
dotty
would
act
like
this
but
she
hoped
to
calm
her
justifiable
anger
well
all
right
dot
she
said
at
last
then
if
you
still
persist
in
quarrelling
with
pauline
about
this
thing
and
if
you
wo
agree
not
to
say
anything
to
her
about
it
then
i
going
to
ask
you
not
to
just
for
my
sake
i
do
often
ask
you
a
favour
seriously
dotty
rose
but
i
do
now
if
you
a
friend
of
mine
and
if
you
really
care
anything
about
me
wo
you
promise
just
because
ask
it
not
to
say
anything
to
pauline
about
those
caps
the
two
shepherdesses
faced
each
other
in
silence
both
were
sitting
in
turkish
fashion
on
the
wide
divan
and
as
they
had
not
turned
on
their
room
lights
only
the
moonlight
that
streamed
across
the
ocean
illumined
the
two
earnest
faces
dolly
was
pale
in
her
earnestness
and
her
blue
eyes
looked
beseechingly
at
her
friend
the
shepherdess
was
flushed
with
anger
her
crook
had
fallen
to
the
floor
and
she
had
tossed
her
hat
beside
it
her
black
eyes
snapped
and
her
curly
head
shook
as
she
refused
dolly
request
but
the
pleading
voice
kept
on
until
at
last
kindness
conquered
and
dotty
rose
gave
in
all
right
you
dear
old
thing
she
cried
as
she
grabbed
dolly
round
the
neck
you
a
heavenly
disposition
and
i
a
horrid
ugly
thing
but
i
do
as
you
say
you
ask
me
to
you
not
ugly
dotty
a
bit
only
you
have
a
high
temper
and
your
sense
of
justice
makes
you
feel
like
getting
even
with
people
and
i
do
say
you
not
right
why
of
course
there
is
such
a
thing
as
righteous
indignation
and
this
may
be
the
place
for
it
only
i
want
to
have
my
way
this
time
you
see
we
going
home
day
after
and
very
likely
we
never
see
the
cliftons
again
after
we
leave
here
they
do
come
here
every
summer
like
we
do
and
i
hate
to
spoil
these
two
last
days
with
a
horrid
squabble
when
we
six
have
been
so
nice
and
chummy
and
pleasant
all
the
time
we
been
here
you
need
have
much
to
do
with
pauline
if
you
do
want
to
but
just
for
two
days
ca
you
just
be
decently
polite
to
her
and
not
say
anything
about
this
business
i
can
and
i
will
said
dotty
heartily
but
you
need
think
old
lady
that
it
because
i
a
meek
and
mild
little
lamb
and
do
feel
like
telling
that
girl
what
i
think
of
her
no
sir
it
because
well
first
because
you
ask
me
to
and
second
because
i
the
guest
of
you
and
your
people
and
it
would
be
a
bit
nice
of
me
to
stir
up
an
unpleasantness
that
probably
everybody
would
know
about
so
unless
miss
pauline
clifton
refers
to
it
herself
she
never
hear
of
that
cap
subject
from
me
you
an
old
trump
dotty
and
i
love
you
a
million
bushels
and
glad
we
going
home
so
soon
and
oh
just
think
we
start
off
to
school
together
and
we
both
go
to
high
school
and
we
have
just
the
same
lessons
and
we
be
together
every
day
dotty
rose
i
got
you
for
a
friend
you
not
half
as
glad
as
am
dolly
fayre
we
always
be
friends
whatever
happens
wo
we
said
dolly
and
we
always
tell
each
other
everything
always
and
always
said
the
other
shepherdess
and
they
sealed
their
compact
with
a
kiss
and
the
big
moon
smiled
at
them
across
the
ocean
and
tried
to
make
up

of
the
two
