cardinal

the
pope
masiuccia
i
arrive
at
naples
cardinal
passionei
received
me
in
a
large
hall
where
he
was
writing
he
begged
me
to
wait
till
he
had
finished
but
he
could
not
ask
me
to
take
a
seat
as
he
occupied
the
only
chair
that
his
vast
room
contained
when
he
had
put
down
his
pen
he
rose
came
to
me
and
after
informing
me
that
he
would
tell
the
holy
father
of
my
visit
he
added
my
brother
cornaro
might
have
made
a
better
choice
as
he
knows
the
pope
does
not
like
me
he
thought
it
better
to
choose
the
man
who
is
esteemed
than
the
man
who
is
merely
liked
i
do
know
whether
the
pope
esteems
me
but
i
am
sure
he
knows
i
esteem
him
i
both
liked
and
esteemed
him
before
he
was
pope
and
i
concurred
in
his
election
but
since
he
has
worn
the
tiara
it
a
different
matter
he
has
shewn
himself
too
much
of
a
the
conclave
ought
to
have
chosen
your
eminence
no
no
i
a
reformer
and
my
hand
would
not
have
been
stayed
for
fear
of
the
vengeance
of
the
guilty
and
god
alone
knows
what
would
have
come
of
that
the
only
cardinal
fit
to
be
pope
was
tamburini
but
it
ca
be
helped
now
i
hear
people
coming
come
again
what
a
delightful
thing
to
have
heard
a
cardinal
call
the
pope
a
fool
and
name
tamburini
as
a
fit
person
i
did
not
lose
a
moment
in
noting
this
pleasant
circumstance
down
it
was
too
precious
a
morsel
to
let
slip
but
who
was
tamburini
i
had
never
heard
of
him
i
asked
winckelmann
who
dined
with
me
he
a
man
deserving
of
respect
for
his
virtues
his
character
his
firmness
and
his
farseeing
intelligence
he
has
never
disguised
his
opinion
of
the
jesuits
whom
he
styles
the
fathers
of
deceits
intrigues
and
lies
and
that
what
made
passionei
mention
him
i
think
with
him
that
tamburini
would
be
a
great
and
good
pope
i
will
here
note
down
what
i
heard
at
rome
nine
years
later
from
the
mouth
of
a
tool
of
the
jesuits
the
cardinal
tamburini
was
at
the
last
gasp
and
the
conversation
turned
upon
him
when
somebody
else
said
this
benedictine
cardinal
is
an
impious
fellow
after
all
he
is
on
his
and
he
has
asked
for
the
viaticum
without
wishing
to
purify
his
soul
by
confession
i
did
not
make
any
remark
but
feeling
as
if
i
should
like
to
know
the
truth
of
the
matter
i
asked
somebody
about
it
next
day
my
informant
being
a
person
who
must
have
known
the
truth
and
could
not
have
had
any
motive
for
disguising
the
real
facts
of
the
case
he
told
me
that
the
cardinal
had
said
mass
three
days
before
and
that
if
he
had
not
asked
for
a
confessor
it
was
doubtless
because
he
had
nothing
to
confess
unfortunate
are
they
that
love
the
truth
and
do
not
seek
it
out
at
its
source
i
hope
the
reader
will
pardon
this
digression
which
is
not
without
interest
next
day
i
went
to
see
cardinal
passionei
who
told
me
i
was
quite
right
to
come
early
as
he
wanted
to
learn
all
about
my
escape
from
the
leads
of
which
he
had
heard
some
wonderful
tales
told
i
shall
be
delighted
to
satisfy
your
eminence
but
the
story
is
a
long
one
all
the
better
they
say
you
tell
it
well
but
my
lord
am
i
to
sit
down
on
the
floor
no
no
your
dress
is
too
good
for
that
he
rang
his
bell
and
having
told
one
of
his
gentlemen
to
send
up
a
seat
a
servant
brought
in
a
stool
a
seat
without
a
back
and
without
arms
it
made
me
quite
angry
i
cut
my
story
short
told
it
badly
and
had
finished
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
write
better
than
you
speak
said
he
my
lord
i
never
speak
well
except
when
i
am
at
my
ease
but
you
are
not
afraid
of
me
no
my
lord
a
true
man
and
a
philosopher
can
never
make
me
afraid
but
this
stool
of
yours
you
like
to
be
at
your
ease
above
all
things
take
this
it
is
the
funeral
oration
of
prince
eugene
i
make
you
a
present
of
it
i
hope
you
will
approve
of
my
latinity
you
can
kiss
the
pope
feet
tomorrow
at
ten
when
i
got
home
as
i
reflected
on
the
character
of
this
strange
cardinal
a
wit
haughty
vain
and
boastful
i
resolved
to
make
him
a
fine
present
it
was
the
liber
unicus
which
de
had
given
me
at
berne
and
which
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
was
a
folio
well
printed
on
fine
paper
choicely
bound
and
in
perfect
preservation
as
chief
librarian
the
present
should
be
a
valuable
one
to
him
all
the
more
as
he
had
a
large
private
library
of
which
my
friend
the
abbe
winckelmann
was
librarian
i
therefore
wrote
a
short
latin
letter
which
i
enclosed
in
another
to
winckelmann
whom
i
begged
to
present
my
offering
to
his
eminence
i
thought
it
was
as
valuable
as
his
funeral
oration
at
any
rate
and
i
hoped
that
he
would
give
me
a
more
comfortable
chair
for
the
future
next
morning
at
the
time
appointed
i
went
to
monte
cavallo
which
ought
to
be
called
monte
cavalli
as
it
gets
its
name
from
two
fine
statues
of
horses
standing
on
a
pedestal
in
the
midst
of
the
square
where
the
holy
father
palace
is
situated
i
had
no
real
need
of
being
presented
to
the
pope
by
anyone
as
any
christian
is
at
liberty
to
go
in
when
he
sees
the
door
open
besides
i
had
known
his
holiness
when
he
was
bishop
of
padua
but
i
had
preferred
to
claim
the
honor
of
being
introduced
by
a
cardinal
after
saluting
the
head
of
the
faithful
and
kissing
the
holy
cross
embroidered
on
his
holy
slipper
the
pope
put
his
right
hand
on
my
left
shoulder
and
said
he
remembered
that
i
always
forsook
the
assembly
at
padua
when
he
intoned
the
rosary
holy
father
i
have
much
worse
sins
than
that
on
my
conscience
so
i
come
prostrate
at
your
foot
to
receive
your
absolution
he
then
gave
me
his
benediction
and
asked
me
very
graciously
what
he
could
do
for
me
i
beg
your
holiness
to
plead
for
me
that
i
may
be
able
to
return
to
venice
we
will
speak
of
it
to
the
ambassador
and
then
we
will
speak
again
to
you
on
the
matter
do
you
often
go
and
see
cardinal
passionei
i
have
been
three
times
he
gave
me
his
funeral
oration
on
prince
eugene
and
in
return
i
sent
him
the
has
he
accepted
them
i
think
so
holy
father
if
he
has
he
will
send
winckelmann
to
pay
you
for
them
that
would
be
treating
me
like
a
bookseller
i
will
not
receive
any
payment
then
he
will
return
the
volume
of
the
we
are
sure
of
it
he
always
does
so
if
his
eminence
returns
me
the
i
will
return
him
his
funeral
oration
at
this
the
pope
laughed
till
his
sides
shook
we
shall
be
pleased
to
hear
the
end
of
the
story
without
anyone
being
informed
of
our
innocent
curiosity
with
these
words
a
long
benediction
delivered
with
much
unction
informed
me
that
my
audience
was
at
an
end
as
i
was
leaving
his
holiness
palace
i
was
accosted
by
an
old
abbe
who
asked
me
respectfully
if
i
were
not
the
casanova
who
had
escaped
from
the
leads
yes
said
i
i
am
the
man
heaven
be
praised
worthy
sir
that
i
see
you
again
in
such
good
estate
but
whom
have
i
the
honour
of
addressing
do
you
recollect
me
i
am
momolo
formerly
gondolier
at
venice
have
you
entered
holy
orders
then
not
at
all
but
here
everyone
wears
the
cassock
i
am
the
first
scopatore
sweeper
of
his
holiness
the
pope
i
congratulate
you
on
your
appointment
but
you
must
mind
me
laughing
laugh
as
much
as
you
like
my
wife
and
daughters
laugh
when
i
put
on
the
cassock
and
bands
and
i
laugh
myself
but
here
the
dress
gains
one
respect
come
and
see
us
where
do
you
live
behind
the
trinity
of
monti
here
my
address
i
will
come
i
went
home
delighted
with
this
meeting
and
determined
to
enjoy
the
evening
with
my
venetian
boatman
i
got
my
brother
to
come
with
me
and
i
told
him
how
the
pope
had
received
me
the
abbe
winckelmann
came
in
the
afternoon
and
informed
me
that
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
high
in
favour
with
his
cardinal
and
that
the
book
i
had
sent
him
was
very
valuable
it
was
a
rare
work
and
in
much
better
condition
than
the
vatican
copy
i
am
commissioned
to
pay
you
for
it
i
have
told
his
eminence
that
it
was
a
present
he
never
accepts
books
as
presents
and
he
wants
yours
for
his
own
library
and
as
he
is
librarian
of
the
vatican
library
he
is
afraid
lest
people
might
say
unpleasant
things
that
very
well
but
i
am
not
a
bookseller
and
as
this
book
only
cost
me
the
trouble
of
accepting
it
i
am
determined
only
to
sell
it
at
the
same
price
pray
ask
the
cardinal
to
honour
me
by
accepting
it
he
is
sure
to
send
it
back
to
you
he
can
if
he
likes
but
i
will
send
back
his
funeral
oration
as
i
am
not
going
to
be
under
an
obligation
to
anyone
who
refuses
to
take
a
present
from
me
next
morning
the
eccentric
cardinal
returned
me
my
pandects
and
i
immediately
returned
his
funeral
oration
with
a
letter
in
which
i
pronounced
it
a
masterpiece
of
composition
though
i
laid
barely
glanced
over
it
in
reality
my
brother
told
me
i
was
wrong
but
i
did
not
trouble
what
he
said
not
caring
to
guide
myself
by
his
rulings
in
the
evening
my
brother
and
i
went
to
the
santissimo
who
was
expecting
me
and
had
announced
me
to
his
family
as
a
prodigy
of
a
man
i
introduced
my
brother
and
proceeded
to
a
close
scrutiny
of
the
family
i
saw
an
elderly
woman
four
girls
of
whom
the
eldest
was
two
small
boys
and
above
all
universal
ugliness
it
was
not
inviting
for
a
man
of
voluptuous
tastes
but
i
was
there
and
the
best
thing
was
to
put
a
good
face
on
it
so
i
stayed
and
enjoyed
myself
besides
the
general
ugliness
the
household
presented
the
picture
of
misery
for
the
santissimo
and
his
numerous
family
were
obliged
to
live
on
two
hundred
roman
crowns
a
year
and
as
there
are
no
perquisites
attached
to
the
office
of
apostolic
sweeper
he
was
compelled
to
furnish
all
needs
out
of
this
slender
sum
in
spite
of
that
momolo
was
a
most
generous
man
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
seated
he
told
me
he
should
have
liked
to
give
me
a
good
supper
but
there
was
only
pork
chops
and
a
polenta
they
are
very
nice
said
i
but
will
you
allow
me
to
send
for
half
a
dozen
flasks
of
orvieto
from
my
lodging
you
are
master
here
i
wrote
a
note
to
costa
telling
him
to
bring
the
six
flasks
directly
with
a
cooked
ham
he
came
in
half
an
hour
and
the
four
girls
cried
when
they
saw
him
what
a
fine
fellow
i
saw
costa
was
delighted
with
this
reception
and
said
to
momolo
if
you
like
him
as
well
as
your
girls
i
will
let
him
stay
costa
was
charmed
with
such
honour
being
shewn
him
and
after
thanking
me
went
into
the
kitchen
to
help
the
mother
with
the
polenta
the
large
table
was
covered
with
a
clean
cloth
and
soon
after
they
brought
in
two
huge
dishes
of
polenta
and
an
enormous
pan
full
of
chops
we
were
just
going
to
begin
when
a
knocking
on
the
street
door
was
heard
is
signora
maria
and
her
mother
said
one
of
the
boys
at
this
announcement
i
saw
the
four
girls
pulling
a
wry
face
who
asked
them
said
one
what
do
they
want
said
another
what
troublesome
people
they
are
said
a
third
they
might
have
stayed
at
home
said
the
fourth
but
the
good
kindly
father
said
my
children
they
are
hungry
and
they
shall
share
what
providence
has
given
us
i
was
deeply
touched
with
the
worthy
man
kindness
i
saw
that
true
christian
charity
is
more
often
to
be
found
in
the
breasts
of
the
poor
than
the
rich
who
are
so
well
provided
for
that
they
can
not
feel
for
the
wants
of
others
while
i
was
making
these
wholesome
reflections
the
two
hungry
ones
came
in
one
was
a
young
woman
of
a
modest
and
pleasant
aspect
and
the
other
her
mother
who
seemed
very
humble
and
as
if
ashamed
of
their
poverty
the
daughter
saluted
the
company
with
that
natural
grace
which
is
a
gift
of
nature
apologizing
in
some
confusion
for
her
presence
and
saying
that
she
would
not
have
taken
the
liberty
to
come
if
she
had
known
there
was
company
the
worthy
momolo
was
the
only
one
who
answered
her
and
he
said
kindly
that
she
had
done
quite
right
to
come
and
put
her
a
chair
between
my
brother
and
myself
i
looked
at
her
and
thought
her
a
perfect
beauty
then
the
eating
began
and
there
was
no
more
talking
the
polenta
was
excellent
the
chops
delicious
and
the
ham
perfect
and
in
less
than
an
hour
the
board
was
as
bare
as
if
there
had
been
nothing
on
it
but
the
orvieto
kept
the
company
in
good
spirts
they
began
to
talk
of
the
lottery
which
was
to
be
drawn
the
day
after
next
and
all
the
girls
mentioned
the
numbers
on
which
they
had
risked
a
few
bajocchi
if
i
could
be
sure
of
one
number
said
i
i
would
stake
something
on
it
mariuccia
told
me
that
if
i
wanted
a
number
she
could
give
me
one
i
laughed
at
this
offer
but
in
the
gravest
way
she
named
me
the
number
is
the
lottery
still
open
i
asked
the
abbe
momolo
till
midnight
he
replied
and
if
you
like
i
will
go
and
get
the
number
for
you
here
are
fifty
crowns
said
i
put
crowns
on
for
these
five
young
ladies
and
the
other
on
coming
out
the
fifth
number
and
this
i
will
keep
for
myself
he
went
out
directly
and
returned
with
the
two
tickets
my
pretty
neighbour
thanked
me
and
said
she
was
sure
of
winning
but
that
she
did
not
think
i
should
succeed
as
it
was
not
probable
that
would
come
out
fifth
i
am
sure
of
it
i
answered
for
you
are
the
fifth
young
lady
i
saw
in
this
house
this
made
everybody
laugh
momolo
wife
told
me
i
would
have
done
much
better
if
i
had
given
the
money
to
the
poor
but
her
husband
told
her
to
be
quiet
as
she
did
not
know
my
intent
my
brother
laughed
and
told
me
i
had
done
a
foolish
thing
i
do
sometimes
said
i
but
we
shall
see
how
it
turns
out
and
when
one
plays
one
is
obliged
either
to
win
or
lose
i
managed
to
squeeze
my
fair
neighbour
hand
and
she
returned
the
pressure
with
all
her
strength
from
that
time
i
knew
that
my
fate
with
mariuccia
was
sealed
i
left
them
at
midnight
begging
the
worthy
momolo
to
ask
me
again
in
two
days
time
that
we
might
rejoice
together
over
our
gains
on
our
way
home
my
brother
said
i
had
either
become
as
rich
as
croesus
or
had
gone
mad
i
told
him
that
both
suppositions
were
incorrect
but
that
mariuccia
was
as
handsome
as
an
angel
and
he
agreed
next
day
mengs
returned
to
rome
and
i
supped
with
him
and
his
family
he
had
an
exceedingly
ugly
sister
who
for
all
that
was
a
good
and
talented
woman
she
had
fallen
deeply
in
love
with
my
brother
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
flame
was
not
yet
extinguished
but
whenever
she
spoke
to
him
which
she
did
whenever
she
could
get
an
opportunity
he
looked
another
way
she
was
an
exquisite
painter
of
miniatures
and
a
capital
hand
at
catching
a
likeness
to
the
best
of
my
belief
she
is
still
living
at
rome
with
maroni
her
husband
she
often
used
to
speak
of
my
brother
to
me
and
one
day
she
said
that
he
must
be
the
most
thankless
of
men
or
he
would
not
despise
her
so
i
was
not
curious
enough
to
enquire
what
claim
she
had
to
his
gratitude
mengs
wife
was
a
good
and
pretty
woman
attentive
to
her
household
duties
and
very
submissive
to
her
husband
though
she
could
not
have
loved
him
for
he
was
anything
but
amiable
he
was
obstinate
and
fierce
in
his
manner
and
when
he
dined
at
home
he
made
a
point
of
not
leaving
the
table
before
he
was
drunk
out
of
his
own
house
he
was
temperate
to
the
extent
of
not
drinking
anything
but
water
his
wife
carried
her
obedience
so
far
as
to
serve
as
his
model
for
all
the
nude
figures
he
painted
i
spoke
to
her
one
day
about
this
unpleasant
obligation
and
she
said
that
her
confessor
had
charged
her
to
fulfil
it
for
said
he
if
your
husband
has
another
woman
for
a
model
he
will
be
sure
to
enjoy
her
before
painting
her
and
that
sin
would
be
laid
to
your
charge
after
supper
winckelmann
who
was
as
far
gone
as
all
the
other
male
guests
played
with
mengs
children
there
was
nothing
of
the
pedant
about
this
philosopher
he
loved
children
and
young
people
and
his
cheerful
disposition
made
him
delight
in
all
kinds
of
enjoyment
next
day
as
i
was
going
to
pay
my
court
to
the
pope
i
saw
momolo
in
the
first
and
i
took
care
to
remind
him
of
the
polenta
for
the
evening
as
soon
as
the
pope
saw
me
he
said
the
venetian
ambassador
has
informed
us
that
if
you
wish
to
return
to
your
native
land
you
must
go
and
present
yourself
before
the
secretary
of
the
tribunal
most
holy
father
i
am
quite
ready
to
take
this
step
if
your
holiness
will
grant
me
a
letter
of
commendation
written
with
your
own
hand
without
this
powerful
protection
i
should
never
dream
of
exposing
myself
to
the
risk
of
being
again
shut
up
in
a
place
from
which
i
escaped
by
a
miracle
and
the
help
of
the
almighty
you
are
gaily
dressed
you
do
not
look
as
if
you
were
going
to
church
true
most
holy
father
but
neither
am
i
going
to
a
ball
we
have
heard
all
about
the
presents
being
sent
back
confess
that
you
did
so
to
gratify
your
pride
yes
but
also
to
lower
a
pride
greater
than
mine
the
pope
smiled
at
this
reply
and
i
knelt
down
and
begged
him
to
permit
me
to
present
the
volume
of
pandects
to
the
vatican
library
by
way
of
reply
he
gave
me
his
blessing
which
signifies
in
papal
language
rise
your
request
is
granted
we
will
send
you
said
he
a
mark
of
our
singular
affection
for
you
without
your
having
to
pay
any
fees
a
second
blessing
bid
me
begone
i
have
often
felt
what
a
good
thing
it
would
be
if
this
kind
of
dismissal
could
be
employed
in
general
society
to
send
away
importunate
petitioners
to
whom
one
does
not
dare
say
begone
i
was
extremely
curious
to
know
what
the
pope
had
meant
by
a
mark
of
our
singular
affection
i
was
afraid
that
it
would
be
a
blessed
rosary
with
which
i
should
not
have
known
what
to
do
when
i
got
home
i
sent
the
book
by
costa
to
the
vatican
and
then
i
went
to
dine
with
mengs
while
we
were
eating
the
soup
the
winning
numbers
from
the
lottery
were
brought
in
my
brother
glanced
at
them
and
looked
at
me
with
astonishment
i
was
not
thinking
of
the
subject
at
that
moment
and
his
gaze
surprised
me
he
cried
came
out
fifth
all
the
better
said
i
we
shall
have
some
amusement
out
of
it
i
told
the
story
to
mengs
who
said
it
a
lucky
folly
for
you
this
time
but
it
always
is
a
folly
he
was
quite
right
and
i
told
him
that
i
agreed
with
him
but
i
added
that
to
make
a
worthy
use
of
the
fifteen
hundred
roman
crowns
which
fortune
had
given
me
i
should
go
and
spend
fifteen
days
at
naples
i
will
come
too
said
the
abbe
alfani
i
will
pass
for
your
secretary
with
all
my
heart
i
answered
i
shall
keep
you
to
your
word
i
asked
winckelmann
to
come
and
eat
polenta
with
the
scopatore
santissimo
and
told
my
brother
to
shew
him
the
way
and
i
then
called
on
the
marquis
belloni
my
banker
to
look
into
my
accounts
and
to
get
a
letter
of
credit
on
the
firm
at
naples
who
were
his
agents
i
still
had
two
hundred
thousand
francs
i
had
jewellery
worth
thirty
thousand
francs
and
fifty
thousand
florins
at
amsterdam
i
got
to
momolo
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
and
i
found
winckelmann
and
my
brother
already
there
but
instead
of
mirth
reigning
round
the
board
i
saw
sad
faces
on
all
sides
what
the
matter
with
the
girls
i
asked
momolo
they
are
vexed
that
you
did
not
stake
for
them
in
the
same
way
as
you
did
for
yourself
people
are
never
satisfied
if
i
had
staked
for
them
as
i
did
for
myself
and
the
number
had
come
out
first
instead
of
fifth
they
would
have
got
nothing
and
they
would
have
been
vexed
then
two
days
ago
they
had
nothing
and
now
that
they
have
pounds
apiece
they
ought
to
be
contented
that
just
what
i
tell
them
but
all
women
are
the
same
and
men
too
dear
countryman
unless
they
are
philosophers
gold
does
not
spell
happiness
and
mirth
can
only
be
found
in
hearts
devoid
of
care
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
but
be
happy
costa
placed
a
basket
containing
ten
packets
of
sweets
upon
the
table
i
will
distribute
them
said
i
when
everybody
is
here
on
this
momolo
second
daughter
told
me
that
mariuccia
and
her
mother
were
not
coming
but
that
they
would
send
them
the
sweets
why
are
they
not
coming
they
had
a
quarrel
yesterday
said
the
father
and
mariuccia
who
was
in
the
right
went
away
saying
that
she
would
never
come
here
again
you
ungrateful
girls
said
i
to
my
host
daughters
do
you
know
that
it
is
to
her
that
you
owe
your
winnings
for
she
gave
me
the
number
which
i
should
never
have
thought
of
quick
think
of
some
way
to
make
her
come
or
i
will
go
away
and
take
all
the
sweets
with
me
you
are
quite
right
said
momolo
the
mortified
girls
looked
at
one
another
and
begged
their
father
to
fetch
her
ira
said
he
that
wo
do
you
made
her
say
that
she
would
never
come
here
again
and
you
must
make
up
the
quarrel
they
held
a
short
consultation
and
then
asking
costa
to
go
with
them
they
went
to
fetch
her
in
half
an
hour
they
returned
in
triumph
and
costa
was
quite
proud
of
the
part
he
had
taken
in
the
reconciliation
i
then
distributed
the
sweets
taking
care
to
give
the
two
best
packets
to
the
fair
mary
a
noble
polenta
was
placed
upon
the
board
flanked
by
two
large
dishes
of
pork
chops
but
momolo
who
knew
my
tastes
and
whom
i
had
made
rich
in
the
person
of
his
daughters
added
to
the
feast
some
delicate
dishes
and
some
excellent
wine
mariuccia
was
simply
dressed
but
her
elegance
and
beauty
and
the
modesty
of
her
demeanour
completely
seduced
me
we
could
only
express
our
mutual
flames
by
squeezing
each
other
hands
and
she
did
this
so
feelingly
that
i
could
not
doubt
her
love
as
we
were
going
out
i
took
care
to
go
downstairs
beside
her
and
asked
if
i
could
not
meet
her
by
herself
to
which
she
replied
by
making
an
appointment
with
me
far
the
next
day
at
eight
at
the
trinity
of
monti
mariuccia
was
tall
and
shapely
a
perfect
picture
as
fair
as
a
white
rose
and
calculated
to
inspire
voluptuous
desires
she
had
beautiful
light
brown
hair
dark
blue
eyes
and
exquisitely
arched
eyelids
her
mouth
the
vermilion
of
her
lips
and
her
ivory
teeth
were
all
perfect
her
forehead
gave
her
an
air
approaching
the
majestic
kindness
and
gaiety
sparkled
in
her
eyes
while
her
plump
white
hands
her
rounded
her
pink
nails
her
breast
which
the
corset
seemed
scarcely
able
to
restrain
her
dainty
feet
and
her
prominent
hips
made
her
worthy
of
the
chisel
of
praxiteles
she
was
just
on
her
eighteenth
year
and
so
far
had
escaped
the
connoisseurs
by
a
lucky
chance
i
came
across
her
in
a
poor
and
wretched
street
and
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
insure
her
happiness
it
may
easily
be
believed
that
i
did
not
fail
to
keep
the
appointment
and
when
she
was
sure
i
had
seen
her
she
went
out
of
the
church
i
followed
her
at
a
considerable
distance
she
entered
a
ruined
building
and
i
after
her
she
climbed
a
flight
of
steps
which
seemed
to
be
built
in
air
and
when
she
had
reached
the
top
she
turned
no
one
will
come
and
look
for
me
here
said
she
so
we
can
talk
freely
together
i
sat
beside
her
on
a
stone
and
i
then
declared
my
passionate
love
for
her
tell
me
i
added
what
i
can
do
to
make
you
happy
for
i
wish
to
possess
you
but
first
to
shew
my
deserts
make
me
happy
and
i
will
yield
to
your
desires
for
i
love
you
tell
me
what
i
can
do
you
can
draw
me
out
of
the
poverty
and
misery
which
overwhelm
me
i
live
with
my
mother
who
is
a
good
woman
but
devout
to
the
point
of
superstition
she
will
damn
my
soul
in
her
efforts
to
save
it
she
finds
fault
with
my
keeping
myself
clean
because
i
have
to
touch
myself
when
i
wash
and
that
might
give
rise
to
evil
desires
if
you
had
given
me
the
money
you
made
me
win
in
the
lottery
as
a
simple
alms
she
would
have
made
me
refuse
it
because
you
might
have
had
intentions
she
allows
me
to
go
by
myself
to
mass
because
our
confessor
told
her
she
might
do
so
but
i
dare
not
stay
away
a
minute
beyond
the
time
except
on
feast
days
when
i
am
allowed
to
pray
in
the
church
for
two
or
three
hours
we
can
only
meet
here
but
if
you
wish
to
soften
my
lot
in
life
you
can
do
so
as
follows
a
fine
young
man
who
is
a
hairdresser
and
bears
an
excellent
character
saw
me
at
momolo
a
fortnight
ago
and
met
me
at
the
church
door
next
day
and
gave
me
a
letter
he
declared
himself
my
lover
and
said
that
if
i
could
bring
him
a
dowry
of
four
hundred
crowns
he
could
open
a
shop
furnish
it
and
marry
me
am
poor
i
answered
i
have
only
a
hundred
crowns
in
charity
tickets
which
my
confessor
keeps
for
me
now
i
have
two
hundred
crowns
for
if
i
marry
my
mother
will
willingly
give
me
her
share
of
the
money
you
made
us
gain
you
can
therefore
make
me
happy
by
getting
me
tickets
to
the
amount
of
two
hundred
crowns
more
take
the
tickets
to
my
confessor
who
is
a
very
good
man
and
fond
of
me
he
will
not
say
anything
to
my
mother
about
it
i
need
go
about
seeking
for
charity
tickets
my
angel
i
will
take
two
hundred
piastres
to
your
confessor
and
you
must
manage
the
rest
yourself
tell
me
his
name
and
i
will
tell
you
what
i
have
done
but
not
here
as
the
wind
and
the
cold
would
be
the
death
of
me
you
can
leave
me
to
find
out
a
room
where
we
shall
be
at
our
ease
and
without
any
danger
of
people
suspecting
that
we
have
spent
an
hour
together
i
will
meet
you
at
the
church
at
the
same
hour
and
when
you
see
me
follow
me
mariuccia
told
me
her
confessor
name
and
allowed
me
all
the
caresses
possible
in
our
uncomfortable
position
the
kisses
she
gave
me
in
return
for
mine
left
no
doubt
in
my
mind
as
to
her
love
for
me
as
nine
struck
i
left
her
perishing
with
cold
but
burning
with
desire
my
only
thought
being
where
to
find
a
room
in
which
i
might
possess
myself
of
the
treasure
the
next
day
on
leaving
the
ruined
palace
instead
of
returning
to
the
piazza
di
spagna
i
turned
to
the
left
and
passed
along
a
narrow
and
dirty
street
only
inhabited
by
people
of
the
lowest
sort
as
i
slowly
walked
along
a
woman
came
out
of
her
house
and
asked
me
politely
if
i
were
looking
for
anybody
i
am
looking
for
a
room
to
let
there
are
none
here
sir
but
you
will
find
a
hundred
in
the
square
i
know
it
but
i
want
the
room
to
be
here
not
for
the
sake
of
the
expense
but
that
i
may
be
sure
of
being
able
to
spend
an
hour
or
so
of
a
morning
with
a
person
in
whom
i
am
interested
i
am
ready
to
pay
anything
i
understand
what
you
mean
and
you
should
have
a
room
in
my
house
if
i
had
one
to
spare
but
a
neighbour
of
mine
has
one
on
the
ground
floor
and
if
you
will
wait
a
moment
i
will
go
and
speak
to
her
you
will
oblige
me
very
much
kindly
step
in
here
i
entered
a
poor
room
where
all
seemed
wretchedness
and
i
saw
two
children
doing
their
lessons
soon
after
the
good
woman
came
back
and
asked
me
to
follow
her
i
took
several
pieces
of
money
from
my
pocket
and
put
them
down
on
the
only
table
which
this
poor
place
contained
i
must
have
seemed
very
generous
for
the
poor
mother
came
and
kissed
my
hand
with
the
utmost
gratitude
so
pleasant
is
it
to
do
good
that
now
when
i
have
nothing
left
the
remembrance
of
the
happiness
i
have
given
to
others
at
small
cost
is
almost
the
only
pleasure
i
enjoy
i
went
to
a
neighbouring
house
where
a
woman
received
me
in
an
empty
room
which
she
told
me
she
would
let
cheaply
if
i
would
pay
three
months
in
advance
and
bring
in
my
own
furniture
what
do
you
ask
for
the
three
months
rent
three
roman
crowns
if
you
will
see
to
the
furnishing
of
the
room
this
very
day
i
will
give
you
twelve
crowns
twelve
crowns
what
furniture
do
you
want
a
good
clean
bed
a
small
table
covered
with
a
clean
cloth
four
good
chairs
and
a
large
brazier
with
plenty
of
fire
in
it
for
i
am
nearly
perishing
of
cold
here
i
shall
only
come
occasionally
in
the
morning
and
i
shall
leave
by
noon
at
the
latest
come
at
three
then
and
you
will
find
everything
to
your
satisfaction
from
there
i
went
to
the
confessor
he
was
a
french
monk
about
sixty
a
fine
and
man
who
won
one
respect
and
confidence
reverend
father
i
began
i
saw
at
the
house
of
abbe
momolo
santissimo
a
young
girl
named
mary
whose
confessor
you
are
i
fell
in
love
with
her
and
offered
her
money
to
try
and
seduce
her
she
replied
that
instead
of
trying
to
lead
her
into
sin
i
would
do
better
to
get
her
some
charity
tickets
that
she
might
be
able
to
marry
a
young
man
who
loved
her
and
would
make
her
happy
i
was
touched
by
what
she
said
but
my
passion
still
remained
i
spoke
to
her
again
and
said
that
i
would
give
her
two
hundred
crowns
for
nothing
and
that
her
mother
should
keep
them
would
be
my
ruin
said
she
mother
would
think
the
money
was
the
price
of
sin
and
would
not
accept
it
if
you
are
really
going
to
be
so
generous
take
the
money
to
my
confessor
and
ask
him
to
do
what
he
can
for
my
marriage
here
then
reverend
father
is
the
sum
of
money
for
the
good
girl
be
kind
enough
to
take
charge
of
it
and
i
will
trouble
her
no
more
i
am
going
to
naples
the
day
after
and
i
hope
when
i
come
back
she
will
be
married
the
good
confessor
took
the
hundred
sequins
and
gave
me
a
receipt
telling
me
that
in
interesting
myself
on
behalf
of
mariuccia
i
was
making
happy
a
most
pure
and
innocent
dove
whom
he
had
confessed
since
she
was
five
years
old
and
that
he
had
often
told
her
that
she
might
communicate
without
making
her
confession
because
he
knew
she
was
incapable
of
mortal
sin
her
mother
he
added
is
a
sainted
woman
and
as
soon
as
i
have
enquired
into
the
character
of
the
future
husband
i
will
soon
bring
the
marriage
about
no
one
shall
ever
know
from
whom
this
generous
gift
comes
after
putting
this
matter
in
order
i
dined
with
the
chevalier
mengs
and
i
willingly
consented
to
go
with
the
whole
family
to
the
aliberti
theatre
that
evening
i
did
not
forget
however
to
go
and
inspect
the
room
i
had
taken
i
found
all
my
orders
executed
and
i
gave
twelve
crowns
to
the
landlady
and
took
the
key
telling
her
to
light
the
fire
at
seven
every
morning
so
impatient
did
i
feel
for
the
next
day
to
come
that
i
thought
the
opera
detestable
and
the
night
for
me
was
a
sleepless
one
next
morning
i
went
to
the
church
before
the
time
and
when
mariuccia
came
feeling
sure
that
she
had
seen
me
i
went
out
she
followed
me
at
a
distance
and
when
i
got
to
the
door
of
the
lodging
i
turned
for
her
to
be
sure
that
it
was
i
and
then
went
in
and
found
the
room
well
warmed
soon
after
mariuccia
came
in
looking
timid
confused
and
as
if
she
were
doubtful
of
the
path
she
was
treading
i
clasped
her
to
my
arms
and
reassured
her
by
my
tender
embraces
and
her
courage
rose
when
i
shewed
her
the
confessor
receipt
and
told
her
that
the
worthy
man
had
promised
to
care
for
her
marriage
she
kissed
my
hand
in
a
transport
of
delight
assuring
me
that
she
would
never
forget
my
kindness
then
as
i
urged
her
to
make
me
a
happy
man
she
said
we
have
three
hours
before
us
as
i
told
my
mother
i
was
going
to
give
thanks
to
god
for
having
made
me
a
winner
in
the
lottery
this
reassured
me
and
i
took
my
time
undressing
her
by
degrees
and
unveiling
her
charms
one
by
one
to
my
delight
without
the
slightest
attempt
at
resistance
on
her
part
all
the
time
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
mine
as
if
to
soothe
her
modesty
but
when
i
beheld
and
felt
all
her
charms
i
was
in
an
ecstasy
what
a
body
what
beauties
nowhere
was
there
the
slightest
imperfection
she
was
like
venus
rising
from
the
foam
of
the
sea
i
carried
her
gently
to
the
bed
and
while
she
strove
to
hide
her
alabaster
breasts
and
the
soft
hair
which
marked
the
entrance
to
the
sanctuary
i
undressed
in
haste
and
consummated
the
sweetest
of
sacrifices
without
there
being
the
slightest
doubt
in
my
mind
of
the
purity
of
the
victim
in
the
first
sacrifice
no
doubt
the
young
priestess
felt
some
pain
but
she
assured
me
out
of
delicacy
that
she
had
not
been
hurt
and
at
the
second
assault
she
shewed
that
she
shared
my
flames
i
was
going
to
immolate
the
victim
for
the
third
time
when
the
clock
struck
ten
she
began
to
be
restless
and
hurriedly
put
on
our
clothes
i
had
to
go
to
naples
but
i
assured
her
that
the
desire
of
embracing
her
once
more
before
her
marriage
would
hasten
my
return
to
rome
i
promised
to
take
another
hundred
crowns
to
her
confessor
advising
her
to
spend
the
money
she
had
won
in
the
lottery
on
her
trousseau
i
shall
be
at
monolo
dearest
and
you
must
come
too
but
we
must
appear
indifferent
to
each
other
though
our
hearts
be
full
of
joy
lest
those
malicious
girls
suspect
our
mutual
understanding
it
is
all
the
more
necessary
to
be
cautious
she
replied
as
i
have
noticed
that
they
suspect
that
we
love
each
other
before
we
parted
she
thanked
me
for
what
i
had
done
for
her
and
begged
me
to
believe
that
her
poverty
notwithstanding
she
had
given
herself
for
love
alone
i
was
the
last
to
leave
the
house
and
i
told
my
landlady
that
i
should
be
away
for
ten
or
twelve
days
i
then
went
to
the
confessor
to
give
him
the
hundred
crowns
i
had
promised
my
mistress
when
the
good
old
frenchman
heard
that
i
had
made
this
fresh
sacrifice
that
mariuccia
might
be
able
to
spend
her
lottery
winnings
on
her
clothes
he
told
me
that
he
would
call
on
the
mother
that
very
day
and
urge
her
to
consent
to
her
daughter
marriage
and
also
learn
where
the
young
man
lived
on
my
return
from
naples
i
heard
that
he
had
faithfully
carried
out
his
promise
i
was
sitting
at
table
with
mengs
when
a
chamberlain
of
the
holy
father
called
when
he
came
in
he
asked
mengs
if
i
lived
there
and
on
that
gentleman
pointing
me
out
he
gave
me
from
his
holy
master
the
cross
of
the
order
of
the
golden
spur
with
the
diploma
and
a
patent
under
the
pontifical
seal
which
in
my
quality
as
doctor
of
laws
made
me
a
urbem
i
felt
that
i
had
been
highly
honoured
and
told
the
bearer
that
i
would
go
and
thank
my
new
sovereign
and
ask
his
blessing
the
next
day
the
chevalier
mengs
embraced
me
as
a
brother
but
i
had
the
advantage
over
him
in
not
being
obliged
to
pay
anything
whereas
the
great
artist
had
to
disburse
roman
crowns
to
have
his
diploma
made
out
there
is
a
saying
at
rome
efusione
sanguinis
non
fit
remissio
which
may
be
interpreted
nothing
without
money
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
one
can
do
anything
with
money
in
the
holy
city
feeling
highly
flattered
at
the
favour
the
holy
father
had
shewn
me
i
put
on
the
cross
which
depended
from
a
broad
red
being
the
colour
worn
by
the
knights
of
john
of
the
lateran
the
companions
of
the
palace
palatini
or
about
the
same
time
poor
cahusac
author
of
the
opera
of
zoroaster
went
mad
for
joy
on
the
receipt
of
the
same
order
i
was
not
so
bad
as
that
but
i
confess
to
my
shame
that
i
was
so
proud
of
my
decoration
that
i
asked
winckelmann
whether
i
should
be
allowed
to
have
the
cross
set
with
diamonds
and
rubies
he
said
i
could
if
i
liked
and
if
i
wanted
such
a
cross
he
could
get
me
one
cheap
i
was
delighted
and
bought
it
to
make
a
show
at
naples
but
i
had
not
the
face
to
wear
it
in
rome
when
i
went
to
thank
the
pope
i
wore
the
cross
in
my
out
of
modesty
five
years
afterwards
when
i
was
at
warsaw
czartoryski
a
russian
made
me
leave
it
off
by
saying
what
are
you
doing
with
that
wretched
bauble
it
a
drug
in
the
market
and
no
one
but
an
impostor
would
wear
it
now
the
popes
knew
this
quite
well
but
they
continued
to
give
the
cross
to
ambassadors
while
they
also
gave
it
to
their
de
chambre
one
has
to
wink
at
a
good
many
things
in
rome
in
the
evening
momolo
gave
me
a
supper
by
way
of
celebrating
my
new
dignity
i
recouped
him
for
the
expense
by
holding
a
bank
at
faro
at
which
i
was
dexterous
enough
to
lose
forty
crowns
to
the
family
without
having
the
slightest
partiality
to
mariuccia
who
won
like
the
rest
she
found
the
opportunity
to
tell
me
that
her
confessor
had
called
on
her
that
she
had
told
him
where
her
future
husband
lived
and
that
the
worthy
monk
had
obtained
her
mother
consent
to
the
hundred
crowns
being
spent
on
her
trousseau
i
noticed
that
momolo
second
daughter
had
taken
a
fancy
to
costa
and
i
told
momolo
that
i
was
going
to
naples
but
that
i
would
leave
my
man
in
rome
and
that
if
i
found
a
marriage
had
been
arranged
on
my
return
i
would
gladly
pay
the
expenses
of
the
wedding
costa
liked
the
girl
but
he
did
not
marry
her
then
for
fear
of
my
claiming
the
he
was
a
fool
of
a
peculiar
kind
though
fools
of
all
sorts
are
common
enough
he
married
her
a
year
later
after
robbing
me
but
i
shall
speak
of
that
again
next
day
after
i
had
breakfasted
and
duly
embraced
my
brother
i
set
out
in
a
nice
carriage
with
the
abbe
alfani
le
duc
preceding
me
on
horseback
and
i
reached
naples
at
a
time
when
everybody
was
in
a
state
of
excitement
because
an
eruption
of
vesuvius
seemed
imminent
at
the
last
stage
the
made
me
read
the
will
of
his
father
who
had
died
during
the
eruption
of
he
said
that
in
the
year
god
would
overwhelm
the
sinful
town
of
naples
and
the
worthy
host
consequently
advised
me
to
return
to
rome
alfani
took
the
thing
seriously
and
said
that
we
should
do
well
to
be
warned
by
so
evident
an
indication
of
the
will
of
god
the
event
was
predicted
therefore
it
had
to
happen
thus
a
good
many
people
reason
but
as
i
was
not
of
the
number
i
proceeded
on
my
way
chapter
ix
my
short
but
happy
stay
at
naples
the
duke
de
matalone
my
daughter
donna
lucrezia
my
departure
i
shall
not
dear
reader
attempt
the
impossible
however
much
i
should
like
to
describe
the
joy
the
happiness
i
may
say
the
ecstasy
which
i
experienced
in
returning
to
naples
of
which
i
had
such
pleasant
memories
and
where
eighteen
years
ago
i
had
made
my
first
fortune
in
returning
from
mataro
as
i
had
come
there
for
the
second
time
to
keep
a
promise
i
had
made
to
the
duke
de
matalone
to
come
and
see
him
at
naples
i
ought
to
have
visited
this
nobleman
at
once
but
foreseeing
that
from
the
time
i
did
so
i
should
have
little
liberty
left
me
i
began
by
enquiring
after
all
my
old
friends
i
walked
out
early
in
the
morning
and
called
on
belloni
agent
he
cashed
my
letter
of
credit
and
gave
me
as
many
as
i
liked
promising
that
nobody
should
know
that
we
did
business
together
from
the
bankers
i
went
to
see
antonio
casanova
but
they
told
me
he
lived
near
salerno
on
an
estate
he
had
bought
which
gave
him
the
title
of
marquis
i
was
vexed
but
i
had
no
right
to
expect
to
find
naples
in
the
statu
quo
i
left
it
polo
was
dead
and
his
son
lived
at
lucia
with
his
wife
and
children
he
was
a
boy
when
i
saw
him
last
and
though
i
should
have
much
liked
to
see
him
again
i
had
no
time
to
do
so
it
may
be
imagined
that
i
did
not
forget
the
advocate
castelli
husband
of
my
dear
lucrezia
whom
i
had
loved
so
well
at
rome
and
tivoli
i
longed
to
see
her
face
once
more
and
i
thought
of
the
joy
with
which
we
should
recall
old
times
that
i
could
never
forget
but
castelli
had
been
dead
for
some
years
and
his
widow
lived
at
a
distance
of
twenty
miles
from
naples
i
resolved
not
to
return
to
rome
without
embracing
her
as
to
lelio
caraffa
he
was
still
alive
and
residing
at
the
matalone
palace
i
returned
feeling
tired
with
my
researches
dressed
with
care
and
drove
to
the
matalone
palace
where
they
told
me
that
the
duke
was
at
table
i
did
not
care
for
that
but
had
my
name
sent
in
and
the
duke
came
out
and
did
me
the
honour
of
embracing
me
and
thouing
me
and
then
presented
me
to
his
wife
a
daughter
of
the
duke
de
bovino
and
to
the
numerous
company
at
table
i
told
him
i
had
only
come
to
naples
in
fulfillment
of
the
promise
i
had
made
him
at
paris
then
said
he
you
must
stay
with
me
and
without
waiting
for
my
answer
ordered
my
luggage
to
be
brought
from
the
inn
and
my
carriage
to
be
placed
in
his
i
accepted
his
invitation
one
of
the
guests
a
man
on
hearing
my
name
announced
said
gaily
if
you
bear
my
name
you
must
be
one
of
my
father
bastards
no
said
i
directly
one
of
your
mother
this
repartee
made
everybody
laugh
and
the
gentleman
who
had
addressed
me
came
and
embraced
me
not
in
the
least
offended
the
joke
was
explained
to
me
his
name
was
casalnovo
not
casanova
and
he
was
duke
and
lord
of
the
fief
of
that
name
did
you
know
said
the
duke
de
matalone
that
i
had
a
son
i
was
told
so
but
did
not
believe
it
but
now
i
must
do
penance
for
my
incredulity
for
i
see
before
me
an
angel
capable
of
working
this
miracle
the
duchess
blushed
but
did
not
reward
my
compliment
with
so
much
as
a
glance
but
all
the
company
applauded
what
i
had
said
as
it
was
notorious
that
the
duke
had
been
impotent
before
his
marriage
the
duke
sent
for
his
son
i
admired
him
and
told
the
father
that
the
likeness
was
perfect
a
merry
monk
who
sat
at
the
right
hand
of
the
duchess
said
more
truthfully
that
there
was
no
likeness
at
all
he
had
scarcely
uttered
the
words
when
the
duchess
coolly
gave
him
a
box
on
the
ear
which
the
monk
received
with
the
best
grace
imaginable
i
talked
away
to
the
best
of
my
ability
and
in
half
an
hour
time
i
had
won
everybody
good
graces
with
the
exception
of
the
duchess
who
remained
inflexible
i
tried
to
make
her
talk
for
two
days
without
success
so
as
i
did
not
care
much
about
her
i
left
her
to
her
pride
as
the
duke
was
taking
me
to
my
room
he
noticed
my
spaniard
and
asked
where
my
secretary
was
and
when
he
saw
that
it
was
the
abbe
alfani
who
had
taken
the
title
so
as
to
escape
the
notice
of
the
neapolitans
he
said
the
abbe
is
very
wise
for
he
has
deceived
so
many
people
with
his
false
antiques
that
he
might
have
got
into
trouble
he
took
me
to
his
stables
where
he
had
some
superb
horses
arabs
english
and
andalusians
and
then
to
his
gallery
a
very
fine
one
to
his
large
and
choice
library
and
at
last
to
his
study
where
he
had
a
fine
collection
of
prohibited
books
i
was
reading
titles
and
turning
over
leaves
when
the
duke
said
promise
to
keep
the
most
absolute
secrecy
on
what
i
am
going
to
shew
you
i
promised
without
making
any
difficulty
but
i
expected
a
surprise
of
some
sort
he
then
shewed
me
a
satire
which
i
could
not
understand
but
which
was
meant
to
turn
the
whole
court
into
ridicule
never
was
there
a
secret
so
easily
kept
you
must
come
to
the
charles
theatre
said
he
and
i
will
present
you
to
the
handsomest
ladies
in
naples
and
afterwards
you
can
go
when
you
like
as
my
box
is
always
open
to
my
friends
i
will
also
introduce
you
to
my
mistress
and
she
i
am
sure
will
always
be
glad
to
see
you
what
you
have
a
mistress
have
you
yes
but
only
for
form
sake
as
i
am
very
fond
of
my
wife
all
the
same
i
am
supposed
to
be
deeply
in
love
with
her
and
even
jealous
as
i
never
introduce
anyone
to
her
and
do
not
allow
her
to
receive
any
visitors
but
does
not
your
young
and
handsome
duchess
object
to
your
keeping
a
mistress
my
wife
could
not
possibly
be
jealous
as
she
knows
that
i
am
impotent
except
of
course
with
her
i
see
but
it
seems
strange
can
one
be
said
to
have
a
mistress
whom
one
does
not
love
i
did
not
say
i
loved
her
not
on
the
contrary
i
am
very
fond
of
her
she
has
a
keen
and
pleasant
wit
but
she
interests
my
head
rather
than
my
heart
i
see
but
i
suppose
she
is
ugly
ugly
you
shall
see
her
and
you
can
tell
me
what
you
think
of
her
afterwards
she
is
a
handsome
and
girl
of
seventeen
can
she
speak
french
as
well
as
a
frenchwoman
i
am
longing
to
see
her
when
we
got
to
the
theatre
i
was
introduced
to
several
ladies
but
none
of
them
pleased
me
the
king
a
mere
boy
sat
in
his
box
in
the
middle
of
the
theatre
surrounded
by
his
courtiers
richly
but
tastefully
dressed
the
pit
was
full
and
the
boxes
also
the
latter
were
ornamented
with
mirrors
and
on
that
occasion
were
all
illuminated
for
some
reason
or
other
it
was
a
magnificent
scene
but
all
this
glitter
and
light
put
the
stage
into
the
background
after
we
had
gazed
for
some
time
at
the
scene
which
is
almost
peculiar
to
naples
the
duke
took
me
to
his
private
box
and
introduced
me
to
his
friends
who
consisted
of
all
the
wits
in
the
town
i
have
often
laughed
on
hearing
philosophers
declare
that
the
intelligence
of
a
nation
is
not
so
much
the
result
of
the
climate
as
of
education
such
sages
should
be
sent
to
naples
and
then
to
petersburg
and
be
told
to
reflect
or
simply
to
look
before
them
if
the
great
boerhaave
had
lived
at
naples
he
would
have
learnt
more
about
the
nature
of
sulphur
by
observing
its
effects
on
vegetables
and
still
more
on
animals
in
naples
and
naples
alone
water
and
nothing
but
water
will
cure
diseases
which
are
fatal
elsewhere
despite
the
efforts
the
duke
who
had
left
me
to
the
wits
for
a
short
time
returned
and
took
me
to
the
box
of
his
mistress
who
was
accompanied
by
an
old
lady
of
respectable
appearance
as
he
went
in
he
said
mia
ti
presento
il
cavalier
don
giacomo
casanova
veneziano
amico
mio
she
received
me
kindly
and
modestly
and
stopped
listening
to
the
music
to
talk
to
me
when
a
woman
is
pretty
one
recognizes
her
charms
instantaneously
if
one
has
to
examine
her
closely
her
beauty
is
doubtful
leonilda
was
strikingly
beautiful
i
smiled
and
looked
at
the
duke
who
had
told
me
that
he
loved
her
like
a
daughter
and
that
he
only
kept
her
for
sake
he
understood
the
glance
and
said
you
may
believe
me
it
credible
i
replied
leonilda
no
doubt
understood
what
we
meant
and
said
with
a
shy
smile
whatever
is
possible
is
credible
quite
so
said
i
but
one
may
believe
or
not
believe
according
to
the
various
degrees
of
possibility
i
think
it
easier
to
believe
than
to
disbelieve
you
came
to
naples
yesterday
that
true
and
yet
incredible
why
incredible
would
any
man
suppose
that
a
stranger
would
come
to
naples
at
a
time
when
the
inhabitants
are
wishing
themselves
away
indeed
i
have
felt
afraid
till
this
moment
but
now
i
feel
quite
at
my
ease
since
you
being
here
januarius
will
surely
protect
naples
why
because
i
am
sure
he
loves
you
but
you
are
laughing
at
me
it
is
such
a
funny
idea
i
am
afraid
that
if
i
had
a
lover
like
januarius
i
should
not
grant
him
many
favours
is
he
very
ugly
then
if
his
portrait
is
a
good
likeness
you
can
see
for
yourself
by
examining
his
statue
gaiety
leads
to
freedom
and
freedom
to
friendship
mental
graces
are
superior
to
bodily
charms
leonilda
frankness
inspired
my
confidence
and
i
led
the
conversation
to
love
on
which
she
talked
like
a
past
mistress
love
said
she
unless
it
leads
to
the
possession
of
the
beloved
object
is
a
mere
torment
if
bounds
are
placed
to
passion
love
must
die
you
are
right
and
the
enjoyment
of
a
beautiful
object
is
not
a
true
pleasure
unless
it
be
preceded
by
love
no
doubt
if
love
precedes
it
accompanies
but
i
do
not
think
it
necessarily
follows
enjoyment
true
it
often
makes
love
to
cease
she
is
a
selfish
daughter
then
to
kill
her
father
and
if
after
enjoyment
love
still
continue
in
the
heart
of
one
it
is
worse
than
murder
for
the
party
in
which
love
still
survives
must
needs
be
wretched
you
are
right
and
from
your
strictly
logical
arguments
i
conjecture
that
you
would
have
the
senses
kept
in
subjection
that
is
too
hard
i
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
platonic
affection
devoid
of
love
but
i
leave
you
to
guess
what
my
maxim
would
be
to
love
and
enjoy
to
enjoy
and
love
turn
and
turn
about
you
have
hit
the
mark
with
this
leonilda
burst
out
laughing
and
the
duke
kissed
her
hand
her
governess
not
understanding
french
was
attending
to
the
opera
but
i
was
in
flames
leonilda
was
only
seventeen
and
was
as
pretty
a
girl
as
the
heart
could
desire
the
duke
repeated
a
lively
epigram
of
lafontaine
on
enjoyment
which
is
only
found
in
the
first
edition
of
his
works
it
begins
as
follows
la
jouissance
et
les
desirs
sont
ce
que
a
de
plus
rare
mais
ce
ne
sons
pas
vrais
plaisirs
des
le
moment
les
separe
i
have
translated
this
epigram
into
italian
and
latin
in
the
latter
language
i
was
almost
able
to
render
lafontaine
line
for
line
but
i
had
to
use
twenty
lines
of
italian
to
translate
the
first
ten
lines
of
the
french
of
course
this
argues
nothing
as
to
the
superiority
of
the
one
language
over
the
other
in
the
best
society
at
naples
one
addresses
a
newcomer
in
the
second
person
singular
as
a
peculiar
mark
of
distinction
this
puts
both
parties
at
their
ease
without
diminishing
their
mutual
respect
for
one
another
leonilda
had
already
turned
my
first
feeling
of
admiration
into
something
much
warmer
and
the
opera
which
lasted
for
five
hours
seemed
over
in
a
moment
after
the
two
ladies
had
gone
the
duke
said
now
we
must
part
unless
you
are
fond
of
games
of
chance
i
do
object
to
them
when
i
am
to
play
with
good
hands
then
follow
me
ten
or
twelve
of
my
friends
will
play
faro
and
then
sit
down
to
a
cold
collation
but
i
warn
you
it
is
a
secret
as
gaming
is
forbidden
i
will
answer
for
you
keeping
your
own
counsel
however
you
may
do
so
he
took
me
to
the
duke
de
monte
leone
we
went
up
to
the
third
floor
passed
through
a
dozen
rooms
and
at
last
reached
the
gamester
chamber
a
banker
with
a
bank
of
about
four
hundred
sequins
had
the
cards
in
his
hands
the
duke
introduced
me
as
his
friend
and
made
me
sit
beside
him
i
was
going
to
draw
out
my
purse
but
i
was
told
that
debts
were
not
paid
for
hours
after
they
were
due
the
banker
gave
me
a
pack
of
cards
with
a
little
basket
containing
a
thousand
counters
i
told
the
company
that
i
should
consider
each
counter
as
a
naples
ducat
in
less
than
two
hours
my
basket
was
empty
i
stopped
playing
and
proceeded
to
enjoy
my
supper
it
was
arranged
in
the
neapolitan
style
and
consisted
of
an
enormous
dish
of
macaroni
and
ten
or
twelve
different
kinds
of
shellfish
which
are
plentiful
on
the
neapolitan
coasts
when
we
left
i
took
care
not
to
give
the
duke
time
to
condole
with
me
on
my
loss
but
began
to
talk
to
him
about
his
delicious
leonilda
early
next
day
he
sent
a
page
to
my
room
to
tell
me
that
if
i
wanted
to
come
with
him
and
kiss
the
king
hand
i
must
put
on
my
gala
dress
i
put
on
a
suit
of
velvet
with
gold
spangles
and
i
had
the
great
honour
of
kissing
a
small
hand
covered
with
chilblains
belonging
to
a
boy
of
nine
the
prince
de
nicander
brought
up
the
young
king
to
the
best
of
his
ability
but
he
was
naturally
a
kindly
just
and
generous
monarch
if
he
had
had
more
dignity
he
would
have
been
an
ideal
king
but
he
was
too
unceremonious
and
that
i
think
is
a
defect
in
one
destined
to
rule
others
i
had
the
honour
of
sitting
next
the
duchess
at
dinner
and
she
deigned
to
say
that
she
had
never
seen
a
finer
dress
that
my
way
i
said
of
distracting
attention
from
my
face
and
figure
she
smiled
and
her
politeness
to
me
during
my
stay
were
almost
limited
to
these
few
words
when
we
left
the
table
the
duke
took
me
to
the
apartment
occupied
by
his
uncle
don
lelio
who
recognized
me
directly
i
kissed
the
venerable
old
man
hand
and
begged
him
to
pardon
me
for
the
freaks
of
my
youth
eighteen
years
ago
said
he
since
i
chose
casanova
as
the
companion
of
your
studies
i
delighted
him
by
giving
him
a
brief
account
of
my
adventures
in
rome
with
cardinal
acquaviva
as
we
went
out
he
begged
me
to
come
and
see
him
often
towards
the
evening
the
duke
said
if
you
go
to
the
opera
buffa
you
will
please
leonilda
he
gave
me
the
number
of
her
box
and
added
i
will
come
for
you
towards
the
close
and
we
will
sup
together
as
before
i
had
no
need
to
order
my
horses
to
be
put
in
as
there
was
always
a
carriage
ready
for
me
in
the
courtyard
when
i
got
to
the
theatre
the
opera
had
begun
i
presented
myself
to
leonilda
who
received
me
with
the
pleasant
words
caro
don
giacomo
i
am
so
pleased
to
see
you
again
no
doubt
she
did
not
like
to
thou
me
but
the
expression
of
her
eyes
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
were
much
better
than
the
to
which
is
often
used
lavishly
at
naples
the
seductive
features
of
this
charming
girl
were
not
altogether
unknown
to
me
but
i
could
not
recollect
of
what
woman
she
reminded
me
leonilda
was
certainly
a
beauty
and
something
superior
to
a
beauty
if
possible
she
had
splendid
light
chestnut
hair
and
her
black
and
brilliant
eyes
shaded
by
thick
lashes
seemed
to
hear
and
speak
at
the
same
time
but
what
ravished
me
still
more
was
her
expression
and
the
exquisite
appropriateness
of
the
gestures
with
which
she
accompanied
what
she
was
saying
it
seemed
as
if
her
tongue
could
not
give
speech
to
the
thoughts
which
crowded
her
brain
she
was
naturally
and
her
intellect
had
been
developed
by
an
excellent
education
the
conversation
turned
upon
lafontaine
epigram
of
which
i
had
only
recited
the
first
ten
verses
as
the
rest
is
too
licentious
and
she
said
but
i
suppose
it
is
only
a
poet
fancy
at
which
one
could
but
smile
possibly
but
i
did
not
care
to
wound
your
ears
you
are
very
good
said
she
using
the
pleasant
tu
but
all
the
same
i
am
not
so
as
i
have
a
closet
which
the
duke
has
had
painted
over
with
couples
in
various
amorous
attitudes
we
go
there
sometimes
and
i
assure
you
that
i
do
not
experience
the
slightest
sensation
that
may
be
through
a
defect
of
temperament
for
whenever
i
see
voluptuous
pictures
i
feel
myself
on
fire
i
wonder
that
while
you
and
the
duke
look
at
them
you
do
not
try
to
put
some
of
them
into
practice
we
have
only
friendship
for
one
another
let
him
believe
it
who
will
i
am
sure
he
is
a
man
but
i
am
unable
to
say
whether
he
is
able
to
give
a
woman
any
real
proofs
of
his
love
yet
he
has
a
son
yes
he
has
a
child
who
calls
him
father
but
he
himself
confesses
that
he
is
only
able
to
shew
his
manly
powers
with
his
wife
that
all
nonsense
for
you
are
made
to
give
birth
to
amorous
desires
and
a
man
who
could
live
with
you
without
being
able
to
possess
you
ought
to
cease
to
live
do
you
really
think
so
dear
leonilda
if
i
were
in
the
duke
place
i
would
shew
you
what
a
man
who
really
loves
can
do
caro
don
giacomo
i
am
delighted
to
hear
you
love
me
but
you
will
soon
forget
me
as
you
are
leaving
naples
cursed
be
the
for
without
it
we
might
spend
some
delightful
hour
together
the
duke
told
me
that
you
lost
a
thousand
ducats
yesterday
evening
like
a
perfect
gentleman
you
must
be
very
unlucky
not
always
but
when
i
play
on
a
day
in
which
i
have
fallen
in
love
i
am
sure
to
lose
you
will
win
back
your
money
this
evening
this
is
the
declaration
day
i
shall
lose
again
then
do
play
people
would
say
i
was
afraid
or
that
all
my
money
was
gone
i
hope
at
all
events
that
you
will
win
sometimes
and
that
you
will
tell
me
of
your
good
luck
come
and
see
me
with
the
duke
the
duke
came
in
at
that
moment
and
asked
me
if
i
had
liked
the
opera
leonilda
answered
for
me
we
have
been
talking
about
love
all
the
time
so
we
do
know
what
has
been
going
on
the
stage
you
have
done
well
i
trust
you
will
bring
casanova
to
see
me
tomorrow
morning
as
i
hope
he
will
bring
me
news
that
he
has
won
it
my
turn
to
deal
this
evening
dearest
but
whether
he
wins
or
loses
you
shall
see
him
you
must
give
us
some
breakfast
i
shall
be
delighted
we
kissed
her
hand
and
went
to
the
same
place
as
the
night
before
the
company
was
waiting
for
the
duke
there
were
twelve
members
of
the
club
and
they
all
held
the
bank
in
turn
they
said
that
this
made
the
chances
more
equal
but
i
laughed
at
this
opinion
as
there
is
nothing
more
difficult
to
establish
than
equality
between
players
the
duke
de
matalone
sat
down
drew
out
his
purse
and
his
and
put
two
thousand
ducats
in
the
bank
begging
pardon
of
the
others
for
doubling
the
usual
sum
in
favour
of
the
stranger
the
bank
never
exceeded
a
thousand
ducats
then
said
i
i
will
hazard
two
thousand
ducats
also
and
not
more
for
they
say
at
venice
that
a
prudent
player
never
risks
more
than
he
can
win
each
of
my
counters
will
be
equivalent
to
two
ducats
so
saying
i
took
ten
notes
of
a
hundred
ducats
each
from
my
pocket
and
gave
them
to
the
last
evening
banker
who
had
won
them
from
me
play
began
and
though
i
was
prudent
and
only
risked
my
money
on
a
single
card
in
less
than
three
hours
my
counters
were
all
gone
i
stopped
playing
though
i
had
still
thousand
ducats
but
i
had
said
that
i
would
not
risk
more
than
two
thousand
and
i
was
ashamed
to
go
back
from
my
word
though
i
have
always
felt
losing
my
money
no
one
has
ever
seen
me
put
out
my
natural
gaiety
was
heightened
by
art
on
such
occasions
and
seemed
to
be
more
brilliant
than
ever
i
have
always
found
it
a
great
advantage
to
be
able
to
lose
pleasantly
i
made
an
excellent
supper
and
my
high
spirits
furnished
me
with
such
a
fund
of
amusing
conversation
that
all
the
table
was
in
a
roar
i
even
succeeded
in
dissipating
the
melancholy
of
the
duke
de
matalone
who
was
in
despair
at
having
won
such
a
sum
from
his
friend
and
guest
he
was
afraid
he
had
half
ruined
me
and
also
that
people
might
say
he
had
only
welcomed
me
for
the
sake
of
my
money
as
we
returned
to
the
palace
the
conversation
was
affectionate
on
his
side
and
jovial
on
mine
but
i
could
see
he
was
in
some
trouble
and
guessed
what
was
the
matter
he
wanted
to
say
that
i
could
pay
the
money
i
owed
him
whenever
i
liked
but
was
afraid
of
wounding
my
feelings
but
as
soon
as
he
got
in
he
wrote
me
a
friendly
note
to
the
effect
that
if
i
wanted
money
his
banker
would
let
me
have
as
much
as
i
required
i
replied
directly
that
i
felt
the
generosity
of
his
offer
and
if
i
was
in
need
of
funds
i
would
avail
myself
of
it
early
next
morning
i
went
to
his
room
and
after
an
affectionate
embrace
i
told
him
not
to
forget
that
we
were
going
to
breakfast
with
his
fair
mistress
we
both
put
on
great
coats
and
went
to
leonilda
pretty
house
we
found
her
sitting
up
in
bed
negligently
but
decently
dressed
with
a
dimity
corset
tied
with
red
ribbons
she
looked
beautiful
and
her
graceful
posture
added
to
her
charms
she
was
reading
crebillon
sopha
the
duke
sat
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
bed
and
i
stood
staring
at
her
in
speechless
admiration
endeavouring
to
recall
to
my
memory
where
i
had
seen
such
another
face
as
hers
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
loved
a
woman
like
her
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
her
without
the
deceitful
glitter
of
candles
she
laughed
at
my
and
told
me
to
sit
down
on
a
chair
by
her
bedside
the
duke
told
her
that
i
was
quite
pleased
at
having
lost
two
thousand
ducats
to
his
bank
as
the
loss
made
me
sure
she
loved
me
caro
mio
don
giacomo
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
you
would
have
done
better
not
to
play
for
i
should
have
loved
you
all
the
same
and
you
would
have
been
two
thousand
ducats
better
off
and
i
two
thousand
ducats
worse
off
said
the
duke
laughing
never
mind
dear
leonilda
i
shall
win
this
evening
if
you
grant
me
some
favour
if
you
do
not
do
so
i
shall
lose
heart
and
you
will
mourn
at
my
grave
before
long
think
leonilda
what
you
can
do
for
my
friend
i
do
see
that
i
can
do
anything
the
duke
told
her
to
dress
that
we
might
go
and
breakfast
in
the
painted
closet
she
began
at
once
and
preserved
a
just
mean
in
what
she
let
us
see
and
what
she
concealed
and
thus
set
me
in
flames
though
i
was
already
captivated
by
her
face
her
wit
and
her
charming
manners
i
cast
an
indiscreet
glance
towards
her
beautiful
breast
and
thus
added
fuel
to
the
fire
i
confess
that
i
only
obtained
this
satisfaction
by
a
species
of
larceny
but
i
could
not
have
succeeded
if
she
had
not
been
well
disposed
towards
me
i
pretended
to
have
seen
nothing
while
dressing
she
maintained
with
much
ingenuity
that
a
wise
girl
will
be
much
more
chary
of
her
favours
towards
a
man
she
loves
than
towards
a
man
she
does
not
love
because
she
would
be
afraid
to
lose
the
first
whereas
she
does
not
care
about
the
second
it
will
not
be
so
with
me
charming
leonilda
said
i
you
make
a
mistake
i
am
sure
the
pictures
with
which
the
closet
where
we
breakfasted
was
adorned
were
admirable
more
from
the
colouring
and
the
design
than
from
the
amorous
combats
they
represented
they
do
make
any
impression
on
me
said
the
duke
and
he
shewed
us
that
it
was
so
leonilda
looked
away
and
i
felt
shocked
but
concealed
my
feelings
i
am
in
the
same
state
as
you
said
i
but
i
will
not
take
the
trouble
of
convincing
you
that
ca
be
said
he
and
passing
his
hand
rapidly
over
me
he
assured
himself
that
it
was
so
it
astonishing
he
cried
you
must
be
as
impotent
as
i
am
if
i
wanted
to
controvert
that
assertion
one
glance
into
leonilda
eyes
would
be
enough
look
at
him
dearest
leonilda
that
i
may
be
convinced
leonilda
looked
tenderly
at
me
and
her
glance
produced
the
result
i
had
expected
give
me
your
hand
said
i
to
the
poor
duke
and
he
did
so
i
was
in
the
wrong
he
exclaimed
but
when
he
endeavoured
to
bring
the
surprising
object
to
light
i
resisted
he
persisted
in
his
endeavours
and
i
determined
to
play
on
him
a
trick
i
took
leonilda
hand
and
pressed
my
lips
to
it
and
just
as
the
duke
thought
he
had
triumphed
i
besprinkled
him
and
went
off
into
a
roar
of
laughter
he
laughed
too
and
went
to
get
a
napkin
the
girl
could
see
nothing
of
all
this
as
it
went
on
under
the
table
and
while
my
burning
lips
rested
on
her
hand
my
eyes
were
fixed
on
hers
and
our
breath
mingled
this
close
contact
had
enabled
me
to
baptise
the
duke
but
when
she
took
in
the
joke
we
made
a
group
worthy
of
the
pen
of
aretin
it
was
a
delightful
breakfast
though
we
passed
certain
bounds
which
decency
ought
to
have
proscribed
to
us
but
leonilda
was
wonderfully
innocent
considering
her
position
we
ended
the
scene
by
mutual
embraces
and
when
i
took
my
burning
lips
from
leonilda
i
felt
consumed
with
a
fire
which
i
could
not
conceal
when
we
left
i
told
the
duke
that
i
would
see
his
mistress
no
more
unless
he
would
give
her
up
to
me
declaring
that
i
would
marry
her
and
give
her
a
dower
of
five
thousand
ducats
speak
to
her
and
if
she
consents
i
will
not
oppose
it
she
herself
will
tell
you
what
property
she
has
i
then
went
to
dress
for
dinner
i
found
the
duchess
in
the
midst
of
a
large
circle
and
she
told
me
kindly
that
she
was
very
sorry
to
hear
of
my
losses
fortune
is
the
most
fickle
of
beings
but
i
do
complain
of
my
loss
nay
when
you
speak
thus
i
love
it
and
i
even
think
that
you
will
make
me
win
this
evening
i
hope
so
but
i
am
afraid
not
you
will
have
to
contend
against
monte
leone
who
is
usually
very
lucky
in
considering
the
matter
after
dinner
i
determined
for
the
future
to
play
with
ready
money
and
not
on
my
word
of
honour
lest
i
should
at
any
time
be
carried
away
by
the
excitement
of
play
and
induced
to
stake
more
than
i
possessed
i
thought
too
that
the
banker
might
have
his
doubts
after
the
two
heavy
losses
i
had
sustained
and
i
confess
that
i
was
also
actuated
by
the
gambler
superstition
that
by
making
a
change
of
any
kind
one
changes
the
luck
i
spent
four
hours
at
the
theatre
in
leonilda
box
where
i
found
her
more
gay
and
charming
than
i
had
seen
her
before
dear
leonilda
i
said
the
love
i
feel
for
you
will
suffer
no
delay
and
no
rivals
not
even
the
slightest
inconstancy
i
have
told
the
duke
that
i
am
ready
to
marry
you
and
that
i
will
give
you
a
dower
of
five
thousand
ducats
what
did
he
say
that
i
must
ask
you
and
that
he
would
offer
no
opposition
then
we
should
leave
naples
together
directly
dearest
and
thenceforth
death
alone
would
part
us
we
will
talk
of
it
dear
don
giacomo
and
if
i
can
make
you
happy
i
am
sure
you
will
do
the
same
by
me
as
she
spoke
these
delightful
words
the
duke
came
in
don
giacomo
and
i
are
talking
of
marrying
said
she
marriage
mia
carissima
he
replied
ought
to
be
well
considered
beforehand
yes
when
one
has
time
but
my
dear
giacomo
can
not
wait
and
we
shall
have
plenty
of
time
to
think
it
over
afterwards
as
you
are
going
to
marry
said
the
duke
you
can
put
off
your
departure
or
return
after
the
wedding
i
can
neither
put
it
off
nor
return
my
dear
duke
we
have
made
up
our
minds
and
if
we
repent
we
have
plenty
of
time
before
us
he
laughed
and
said
we
would
talk
it
over
next
day
i
gave
my
future
bride
a
kiss
which
she
returned
with
ardour
and
the
duke
and
i
went
to
the
club
where
we
found
the
duke
de
monte
leone
dealing
my
lord
said
i
i
am
unlucky
playing
on
my
word
of
honour
so
i
hope
you
will
allow
me
to
stake
money
just
as
you
please
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
but
do
trouble
yourself
i
have
made
a
bank
of
four
thousand
ducats
that
you
may
be
able
to
recoup
yourself
for
your
losses
thanks
i
promise
to
break
it
or
to
lose
as
much
i
drew
out
six
thousand
ducats
gave
two
thousand
ducats
to
the
duke
de
matalone
and
began
to
punt
at
a
hundred
ducats
after
a
short
time
the
duke
left
the
table
and
i
finally
succeeded
in
breaking
the
bank
i
went
back
to
the
place
by
myself
and
when
i
told
the
duke
of
my
victory
the
next
day
he
embraced
me
with
tears
of
joy
and
advised
me
to
stake
money
for
the
future
as
the
princess
de
vale
was
giving
a
great
supper
there
was
no
play
that
evening
this
was
some
respite
we
called
on
leonilda
and
putting
off
talking
of
our
marriage
till
the
day
after
we
spent
the
time
in
viewing
the
wonders
of
nature
around
naples
in
the
evening
i
was
introduced
by
a
friend
at
the
princess
supper
and
saw
all
the
highest
nobility
of
the
place
next
morning
the
duke
told
me
that
he
had
some
business
to
do
and
that
i
had
better
go
and
see
leonilda
and
that
he
would
call
for
me
later
on
i
went
to
leonilda
but
as
the
duke
did
not
put
in
an
appearance
we
could
not
settle
anything
about
our
marriage
i
spent
several
hours
with
her
but
i
was
obliged
to
obey
her
commands
and
could
only
shew
myself
amorous
in
words
before
leaving
i
repeated
that
it
only
rested
with
her
to
unite
our
lives
by
indissoluble
ties
and
to
leave
naples
almost
immediately
when
i
saw
the
duke
he
said
well
don
giacomo
you
have
spent
all
the
morning
with
my
mistress
do
you
still
wish
to
marry
her
more
than
ever
what
do
you
mean
nothing
and
as
you
have
passed
this
trial
to
which
i
purposely
subjected
you
we
will
discuss
your
union
tomorrow
and
i
hope
you
will
make
this
charming
woman
happy
for
she
will
be
an
excellent
wife
i
agree
with
you
when
we
went
to
monte
leone
in
the
evening
we
saw
a
banker
with
a
good
deal
of
gold
before
him
the
duke
told
me
he
was
don
marco
ottoboni
he
was
a
man
but
he
held
the
cards
so
closely
together
in
his
left
hand
that
i
could
not
see
them
this
did
not
inspire
me
with
confidence
so
i
only
punted
a
ducat
at
a
time
i
was
persistently
unlucky
but
i
only
lost
a
score
of
ducats
after
five
or
six
deals
the
banker
asked
me
politely
why
i
staked
such
small
sums
against
him
because
i
ca
see
half
the
pack
i
replied
and
i
am
afraid
of
losing
some
of
the
company
laughed
at
my
answer
next
night
i
broke
the
bank
held
by
the
prince
the
cassaro
a
pleasant
and
rich
nobleman
who
asked
me
to
give
him
revenge
and
invited
me
to
supper
at
his
pretty
house
at
posilipo
where
he
lived
with
a
virtuosa
of
whom
he
had
become
amorous
at
palermo
he
also
invited
the
duke
de
matalone
and
three
or
four
other
gentlemen
this
was
the
only
occasion
on
which
i
held
the
bank
while
i
was
at
naples
and
i
staked
six
thousand
ducats
after
warning
the
prince
that
as
it
was
the
eve
of
my
departure
i
should
only
play
for
ready
money
he
lost
ten
thousand
ducats
and
only
rose
from
the
table
because
he
had
no
more
money
everybody
left
the
room
and
i
should
have
done
the
same
if
the
prince
mistress
had
not
owed
me
a
hundred
ducats
i
continued
to
deal
in
the
hope
that
she
would
get
her
money
back
but
seeing
that
she
still
lost
i
put
down
the
cards
and
told
her
that
she
must
pay
me
at
rome
she
was
a
handsome
and
agreeable
woman
but
she
did
not
inspire
me
with
any
passions
no
doubt
because
my
mind
was
occupied
with
another
otherwise
i
should
have
drawn
a
bill
on
sight
and
paid
myself
without
meddling
with
her
purse
it
was
two
in
the
morning
when
i
got
to
bed
both
leonilda
and
myself
wished
to
see
caserta
before
leaving
naples
and
the
duke
sent
us
there
in
a
carriage
drawn
by
six
mules
which
went
faster
than
most
horses
leonilda
governess
accompanied
us
the
day
after
we
settled
the
particulars
of
our
marriage
in
a
conversation
which
lasted
for
two
hours
leonilda
began
the
duke
has
a
mother
who
lives
at
a
short
distance
from
here
on
an
income
of
six
hundred
ducats
which
i
have
given
her
for
life
in
return
for
an
estate
belonging
to
her
husband
but
leonilda
does
not
depend
on
her
she
gave
her
up
to
me
seven
years
ago
and
i
have
given
her
an
annuity
of
five
hundred
ducats
which
she
will
bring
to
you
with
all
her
diamonds
and
an
extensive
trousseau
her
mother
gave
her
up
to
me
entirely
and
i
gave
my
word
of
honour
to
get
her
a
good
husband
i
have
taken
peculiar
care
of
her
education
and
as
her
mind
has
developed
i
have
put
her
on
her
guard
against
all
prejudices
with
the
exception
of
that
which
bids
a
woman
keep
herself
intact
for
her
future
husband
you
may
rest
assured
that
you
are
the
first
man
whom
leonilda
who
is
a
daughter
to
me
has
pressed
to
her
heart
i
begged
the
duke
to
get
the
contract
ready
and
to
add
to
her
dower
the
sum
of
five
thousand
ducats
which
i
would
give
him
when
the
deed
was
signed
i
will
mortgage
them
said
he
on
a
house
which
is
worth
double
then
turning
to
leonilda
who
was
shedding
happy
tears
he
said
i
am
going
to
send
for
your
mother
who
will
be
delighted
to
sign
the
settlement
and
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
your
future
husband
the
mother
lived
at
the
marquis
galiani
a
day
journey
from
naples
the
duke
said
he
would
send
a
carriage
for
her
the
next
day
and
that
we
could
all
sup
together
the
day
after
the
law
business
will
be
all
done
by
then
and
we
shall
be
able
to
go
to
the
little
church
at
portici
and
the
priest
will
marry
you
then
we
will
take
your
mother
to
agatha
and
dine
with
her
and
you
can
go
your
way
with
her
maternal
blessing
this
conclusion
gave
me
an
involuntary
shudder
and
leonilda
fell
fainting
in
the
duke
arms
he
called
her
dear
child
cared
for
her
tenderly
and
brought
her
to
herself
we
all
had
to
wipe
our
eyes
as
we
were
all
equally
affected
i
considered
myself
as
a
married
man
and
under
obligation
to
alter
my
way
of
living
and
i
stopped
playing
i
had
won
more
than
fifteen
thousand
ducats
and
this
sum
added
to
what
i
had
before
and
leonilda
dowry
should
have
sufficed
for
an
honest
livelihood
next
day
as
i
was
at
supper
with
the
duke
and
leonilda
she
said
what
will
my
mother
say
evening
when
she
sees
you
she
will
say
that
you
are
silly
to
marry
a
stranger
whom
you
have
only
known
for
a
week
have
you
told
her
my
name
my
nation
my
condition
and
my
age
i
wrote
to
her
as
follows
mamma
come
directly
and
sign
my
marriage
contract
with
a
gentleman
introduced
to
me
by
the
duke
with
whom
i
shall
be
leaving
for
rome
on
monday
next
my
letter
ran
thus
said
the
duke
without
delay
and
sign
your
daughter
marriage
contract
and
give
her
your
blessing
she
has
wisely
chosen
a
husband
old
enough
to
be
her
father
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
that
not
true
cried
leonilda
rushing
to
my
arms
she
will
think
you
are
really
old
and
i
am
sorry
is
your
mother
an
elderly
woman
she
a
charming
woman
said
the
duke
full
of
wit
and
not
yet
what
has
she
got
to
do
with
galiani
she
is
an
intimate
friend
of
the
marchioness
and
she
lives
with
the
family
but
pays
for
her
board
next
morning
having
some
business
with
my
banker
to
attend
to
i
told
the
duke
that
i
should
not
be
able
to
see
leonilda
till
i
went
there
at
eight
and
i
found
the
three
sitting
in
front
of
the
fire
here
he
is
cried
the
duke
as
soon
as
the
mother
saw
me
she
screamed
and
fell
nearly
fainting
on
a
chair
i
looked
at
her
fixedly
for
a
minute
and
exclaimed
donna
lucrezia
i
am
fortunate
indeed
let
us
take
breath
my
dear
friend
come
and
sit
by
me
so
you
are
going
to
marry
my
daughter
are
you
i
took
a
chair
and
guessed
it
all
my
hair
stood
on
end
and
i
relapsed
into
a
gloomy
silence
the
stupefied
astonishment
of
leonilda
and
the
duke
can
not
be
described
they
could
see
that
donna
lucrezia
and
i
knew
each
other
but
they
could
not
get
any
farther
as
for
myself
as
i
pondered
gloomily
and
compared
leonilda
age
with
the
period
at
which
i
had
been
intimate
with
lucrezia
castelli
i
could
see
that
it
was
quite
possible
that
she
might
be
my
daughter
but
i
told
myself
that
the
mother
could
not
be
certain
of
the
fact
as
at
the
time
she
lived
with
her
husband
who
was
very
fond
of
her
and
not
fifty
years
of
age
i
could
bear
the
suspense
no
longer
so
taking
a
light
and
begging
leonilda
and
the
duke
to
excuse
me
i
asked
lucrezia
to
come
into
the
next
room
with
me
as
soon
as
she
was
seated
she
drew
me
to
her
and
said
must
i
grieve
my
dear
one
when
i
have
loved
so
well
leonilda
is
your
daughter
i
am
certain
of
it
i
always
looked
upon
her
as
your
daughter
and
my
husband
knew
it
but
far
from
being
angry
he
used
to
adore
her
i
will
shew
you
the
register
of
her
birth
and
you
can
calculate
for
yourself
my
husband
was
at
rome
and
did
not
see
me
once
and
my
daughter
did
not
come
before
her
time
you
must
remember
a
letter
which
my
mother
should
have
given
you
in
which
i
told
you
i
was
with
child
that
was
in
january
and
in
six
months
my
daughter
will
be
seventeen
my
late
husband
gave
her
the
names
of
leonilda
giacomina
at
the
baptismal
font
and
when
he
played
with
her
he
always
called
her
by
the
latter
name
this
idea
of
your
marrying
her
horrifies
me
but
i
can
not
oppose
it
as
i
am
ashamed
to
tell
the
reason
what
do
you
think
have
you
still
the
courage
to
marry
her
you
seem
to
hesitate
have
you
taken
any
earnest
of
the
no
dear
lucrezia
your
daughter
is
as
pure
as
a
lily
i
breathe
again
ah
yes
but
my
heart
is
torn
asunder
i
am
grieved
to
see
you
thus
she
has
no
likeness
to
me
that
proves
nothing
she
has
taken
after
me
you
are
weeping
dearest
you
will
break
my
heart
who
would
not
weep
in
my
place
i
will
send
the
duke
to
you
he
must
know
all
i
left
lucrezia
and
i
begged
the
duke
to
go
and
speak
to
her
the
affectionate
leonilda
came
and
sat
on
my
knee
and
asked
me
what
the
dreadful
mystery
was
i
was
too
much
affected
to
be
able
to
answer
her
she
kissed
me
and
we
began
to
weep
we
remained
thus
sad
and
silent
till
the
return
of
the
duke
and
donna
lucrezia
who
was
the
only
one
to
keep
her
head
cool
dear
leonilda
said
she
you
must
be
let
into
the
secret
of
this
disagreeable
mystery
and
your
mother
is
the
proper
person
to
enlighten
you
do
you
remember
what
name
my
late
husband
used
to
call
you
when
he
petted
you
he
used
to
call
me
his
charming
giacomina
that
is
casanova
name
it
is
the
name
of
your
father
go
and
kiss
him
his
blood
flows
in
your
veins
and
if
he
has
been
your
lover
repent
of
the
crime
which
was
happily
quite
involuntary
the
scene
was
a
pathetic
one
and
we
were
all
deeply
moved
leonilda
clung
to
her
mother
knees
and
in
a
voice
that
struggled
with
sobs
exclaimed
i
have
only
felt
what
an
affectionate
daughter
might
feel
for
a
father
at
this
point
silence
fell
on
us
a
silence
that
was
only
broken
by
the
sobs
of
the
two
women
who
held
each
other
tightly
embraced
while
the
duke
and
i
sat
as
motionless
as
two
posts
our
heads
bent
and
our
hands
crossed
without
as
much
as
looking
at
each
other
supper
was
served
and
we
sat
at
table
for
three
hours
talking
sadly
over
this
dramatic
recognition
which
had
brought
more
grief
than
joy
and
we
departed
at
midnight
full
of
melancholy
and
hoping
that
we
should
be
calmer
on
the
morrow
and
able
to
take
the
only
step
that
now
remained
to
us
as
we
were
going
away
the
duke
made
several
observations
on
what
moral
philosophers
call
prejudices
there
is
no
philosopher
who
would
maintain
or
even
advance
the
thesis
that
the
union
of
a
father
and
daughter
is
horrible
naturally
for
it
is
entirely
a
social
prejudice
but
it
is
so
widespread
and
education
has
graven
it
so
deeply
in
our
hearts
that
only
a
man
whose
heart
is
utterly
depraved
could
despise
it
it
is
the
result
of
a
respect
for
the
laws
it
keeps
the
social
scheme
together
in
fact
it
is
no
longer
a
prejudice
it
is
a
principle
i
went
to
bed
but
as
usual
after
the
violent
emotion
i
had
undergone
i
could
not
sleep
the
rapid
transition
from
carnal
to
paternal
love
cast
my
physical
and
mental
faculties
into
such
a
state
of
excitement
that
i
could
scarcely
withstand
the
fierce
struggle
that
was
taking
place
in
my
heart
towards
morning
i
fell
asleep
for
a
short
time
and
woke
up
feeling
as
exhausted
as
two
lovers
who
have
been
spending
a
long
and
voluptuous
winter
night
when
i
got
up
i
told
the
duke
that
i
intended
to
set
out
from
naples
the
next
day
and
he
observed
that
as
everybody
knew
i
was
on
the
eve
of
my
departure
this
haste
would
make
people
talk
come
and
have
some
broth
with
me
said
he
and
from
henceforth
look
upon
this
marriage
project
as
one
of
the
many
pranks
in
which
you
have
engaged
we
will
spend
the
three
or
four
days
pleasantly
together
and
perhaps
when
we
have
thought
over
all
this
for
some
time
we
shall
end
by
thinking
it
matter
for
mirth
and
not
sadness
believe
me
the
mother
as
good
as
the
daughter
recollection
is
often
better
than
hope
console
yourself
with
lucrezia
i
do
think
you
can
see
any
difference
between
her
present
appearance
and
that
of
eighteen
years
ago
for
i
do
see
how
she
can
ever
have
been
handsomer
than
she
is
now
this
remonstrance
brought
me
to
my
senses
i
felt
that
the
best
thing
i
could
do
would
be
to
forget
the
illusion
which
had
amused
me
for
four
or
five
days
and
as
my
was
not
wounded
it
ought
not
to
be
a
difficult
task
but
yet
i
was
in
love
and
unable
to
satisfy
my
love
love
is
not
like
merchandise
where
one
can
substitute
one
thing
for
another
when
one
can
not
have
what
one
wants
love
is
a
sentiment
only
the
object
who
has
kindled
the
flame
can
soothe
the
heat
thereof
we
went
to
call
on
my
daughter
the
duke
in
his
usual
mood
but
i
looking
pale
depressed
weary
and
like
a
boy
going
to
receive
the
rod
i
was
extremely
surprised
when
i
came
into
the
room
to
find
the
mother
and
daughter
quite
gay
but
this
helped
on
my
cure
leonilda
threw
her
arms
round
my
neck
calling
me
dear
papa
and
kissing
me
with
all
a
freedom
donna
lucrezia
stretched
out
her
hand
addressing
me
as
her
dear
friend
i
regarded
her
attentively
and
i
was
forced
to
confess
that
the
eighteen
years
that
had
passed
away
had
done
little
ill
to
her
charms
there
was
the
same
sparkling
glance
that
fresh
complexion
those
perfect
shapes
those
beautiful
lips
in
fine
all
that
had
charmed
my
youthful
eyes
we
mutely
caressed
each
other
leonilda
gave
and
received
the
tenderest
kisses
without
seeming
to
notice
what
desires
she
might
cause
to
arise
no
doubt
she
knew
that
as
her
father
i
should
have
strength
to
resist
and
she
was
right
one
gets
used
to
everything
and
i
was
ashamed
to
be
sad
any
longer
i
told
donna
lucrezia
of
the
curious
welcome
her
sister
had
given
me
in
rome
and
she
went
off
into
peals
of
laughter
we
reminded
each
other
of
the
night
at
tivoli
and
these
recollections
softened
our
hearts
from
these
softened
feelings
to
love
is
but
a
short
way
but
neither
place
nor
time
were
convenient
so
we
pretended
not
to
be
thinking
of
it
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
i
told
her
that
if
she
cared
to
come
to
rome
with
me
to
pay
a
visit
to
her
sister
angelique
i
would
take
her
back
to
naples
at
the
beginning
of
lent
she
promised
to
let
me
know
whether
she
could
come
on
the
following
day
i
sat
between
her
and
leonilda
at
dinner
and
as
i
could
no
longer
think
of
the
daughter
it
was
natural
that
my
old
flame
for
lucrezia
should
rekindle
and
whether
from
the
effect
of
her
gaiety
and
beauty
or
from
my
need
of
someone
to
love
or
from
the
excellence
of
the
wine
i
found
myself
in
love
with
her
by
the
dessert
and
asked
her
to
take
the
place
which
her
daughter
was
to
have
filled
i
will
marry
you
said
i
and
we
will
all
of
us
go
to
rome
on
monday
for
since
leonilda
is
my
daughter
i
do
not
like
to
leave
her
at
naples
at
this
the
three
guests
looked
at
each
other
and
said
nothing
i
did
not
repeat
my
proposal
but
led
the
conversation
to
some
other
topic
after
dinner
i
felt
sleepy
and
lay
down
on
a
bed
and
did
not
wake
till
eight
when
to
my
surprise
i
found
that
my
only
companion
was
lucrezia
who
was
writing
she
heard
me
stir
and
came
up
to
me
and
said
affectionately
my
dear
friend
you
have
slept
for
five
hours
and
as
i
did
not
like
to
leave
you
alone
i
would
not
go
with
the
duke
and
our
daughter
to
the
opera
the
memory
of
former
loves
awakens
when
one
is
near
the
once
beloved
object
and
desires
rapidly
become
irresistible
if
the
beauty
still
remain
the
lovers
feel
as
if
they
were
once
more
in
possession
of
a
blessing
which
belongs
to
them
and
of
which
they
have
been
long
deprived
by
unfortunate
incidents
these
were
our
feelings
and
without
delay
without
idle
discussion
and
above
all
without
false
modesty
we
abandoned
ourselves
to
love
the
only
true
source
of
nature
in
the
first
interval
i
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
and
if
a
man
is
anything
of
a
wit
is
he
the
less
so
at
that
delicious
moment
of
repose
which
follows
on
an
amorous
victory
once
again
then
said
i
i
am
in
this
charming
land
which
i
entered
for
the
first
time
to
the
noise
of
the
drum
and
the
rattle
of
musket
shots
this
remark
made
her
laugh
and
recalled
past
events
to
her
memory
we
recollected
with
delight
all
the
pleasures
we
had
enjoyed
at
testaccio
frascati
and
tivoli
we
reminded
each
other
of
these
events
only
to
make
each
other
laugh
but
with
two
lovers
what
is
laughter
but
a
pretext
for
renewing
the
sweet
sacrifice
of
the
goddess
of
cythera
at
the
end
of
the
second
act
full
of
the
enthusiasm
of
the
fortunate
lover
i
said
let
us
be
united
for
life
we
are
of
the
same
age
we
love
each
other
our
means
are
sufficient
for
us
we
may
hope
to
live
a
happy
life
and
to
die
at
the
same
moment
tis
the
darling
wish
of
my
heart
lucrezia
replied
but
let
us
stay
at
naples
and
leave
leonilda
to
the
duke
we
will
see
company
find
her
a
worthy
husband
and
our
happiness
will
be
complete
i
can
not
live
at
naples
dearest
and
you
know
that
your
daughter
intended
to
leave
with
me
my
daughter
say
our
daughter
i
see
that
you
are
still
in
love
with
her
and
do
not
wish
to
be
considered
her
father
alas
yes
but
i
am
sure
that
if
i
live
with
you
my
passion
for
her
will
be
stilled
but
otherwise
i
can
not
answer
for
myself
i
shall
fly
but
flight
will
not
bring
me
happiness
leonilda
charms
me
still
more
by
her
intelligence
than
by
her
beauty
i
was
sure
that
she
loved
me
so
well
that
i
did
not
attempt
to
seduce
her
lest
thereby
i
should
weaken
my
hold
on
her
affections
and
as
i
wanted
to
make
her
happy
i
wished
to
deserve
her
esteem
i
longed
to
possess
her
but
in
a
lawful
manner
so
that
our
rights
should
have
been
equal
we
have
created
an
angel
lucrezia
and
i
can
not
imagine
how
the
duke
the
duke
is
completely
impotent
do
you
see
now
how
i
was
able
to
trust
my
daughter
to
his
care
impotent
i
always
thought
so
myself
but
he
has
a
son
his
wife
might
possibly
be
able
to
explain
that
mystery
to
you
but
you
may
take
it
for
granted
that
the
poor
duke
will
die
a
virgin
in
spite
of
himself
and
he
knows
that
as
well
as
anybody
do
not
let
us
say
any
more
about
it
but
allow
me
to
treat
you
as
at
tivoli
not
just
now
as
i
hear
carriage
wheels
a
moment
after
the
door
opened
and
leonilda
laughed
heartily
to
see
her
mother
in
my
arms
and
threw
herself
upon
us
covering
us
with
kisses
the
duke
came
in
a
little
later
and
we
supped
together
very
merrily
he
thought
me
the
happiest
of
men
when
i
told
him
i
was
going
to
pass
the
night
honourably
with
my
wife
and
daughter
and
he
was
right
for
i
was
so
at
that
moment
as
soon
as
the
worthy
man
left
us
we
went
to
bed
but
here
i
must
draw
a
veil
over
the
most
voluptuous
night
i
have
ever
spent
if
i
told
all
i
should
wound
chaste
ears
and
besides
all
the
colours
of
the
painter
and
all
the
phrases
of
the
poet
could
not
do
justice
to
the
delirium
of
pleasure
the
ecstasy
and
the
license
which
passed
during
that
night
while
two
wax
lights
burnt
dimly
on
the
table
like
candles
before
the
shrine
of
a
saint
we
did
not
leave
the
stage
which
i
watered
with
my
blood
till
long
after
the
sun
had
risen
we
were
scarcely
dressed
when
the
duke
arrived
leonilda
gave
him
a
vivid
description
of
our
nocturnal
labours
but
in
his
unhappy
state
of
impotence
he
must
have
been
thankful
for
his
absence
i
was
determined
to
start
the
next
day
so
as
to
be
at
rome
for
the
last
week
of
the
carnival
and
i
begged
the
duke
to
let
me
give
leonilda
the
five
thousand
ducats
which
would
have
been
her
dower
if
she
had
become
my
bride
as
she
is
your
daughter
said
he
she
can
and
ought
to
take
this
present
from
her
father
if
only
as
a
dowry
for
her
future
husband
will
you
accept
it
then
my
dear
leonilda
yes
papa
dear
she
said
embracing
me
on
the
condition
that
you
will
promise
to
come
and
see
me
again
as
soon
as
you
hear
of
my
marriage
i
promised
to
do
so
and
i
kept
my
word
as
you
are
going
said
the
duke
i
shall
ask
all
the
nobility
of
naples
to
meet
you
at
supper
in
the
meanwhile
i
leave
you
with
your
daughter
we
shall
see
each
other
again
at
suppertime
he
went
out
and
i
dined
with
my
wife
and
daughter
in
the
best
of
spirits
i
spent
almost
the
whole
afternoon
with
leonilda
keeping
within
the
bounds
of
decency
less
perhaps
out
of
respect
to
morality
than
because
of
my
labours
of
the
night
before
we
did
not
kiss
each
other
till
the
moment
of
parting
and
i
could
see
that
both
mother
and
daughter
were
grieved
to
lose
me
after
a
careful
toilette
i
went
to
supper
and
found
an
assembly
of
a
hundred
of
the
very
best
people
in
naples
the
duchess
was
very
agreeable
and
when
i
kissed
her
hand
to
take
leave
she
said
i
hope
don
giacomo
that
you
have
had
no
unpleasantness
during
your
short
stay
at
naples
and
that
you
will
sometimes
think
of
your
visit
with
pleasure
i
answered
that
i
could
only
recall
my
visit
with
delight
after
the
kindness
with
which
she
had
deigned
to
treat
me
that
evening
and
in
fact
my
recollections
of
naples
were
always
of
the
happiest
description
after
i
had
treated
the
duke
attendants
with
generosity
the
poor
nobleman
whom
fortune
had
favoured
and
whom
nature
had
deprived
of
the
sweetest
of
all
enjoyments
came
with
me
to
the
door
of
my
carriage
and
i
went
on
my
way
chapter
x
my
carriage
broken
mariuccia
of
lord
lismore
my
return
to
florence
and
my
departure
with
the
corticelli
my
spaniard
was
going
on
before
us
on
horseback
and
i
was
sleeping
profoundly
beside
don
ciccio
alfani
in
my
comfortable
carriage
drawn
by
four
horses
when
a
violent
shock
aroused
me
the
carriage
had
been
overturned
on
the
highway
at
midnight
beyond
francolisa
and
four
miles
from
agatha
alfani
was
beneath
me
and
uttered
piercing
shrieks
for
he
thought
he
had
broken
his
left
arm
le
duc
rode
back
and
told
me
that
the
postillions
had
taken
flight
possibly
to
give
notice
of
our
mishap
to
highwaymen
who
are
very
common
in
the
states
of
the
church
and
naples
i
got
out
of
the
carriage
easily
enough
but
poor
old
alfani
who
was
unwieldly
with
fat
badly
hurt
and
half
dead
with
fright
could
not
extricate
himself
without
assistance
it
took
us
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
get
him
free
the
poor
wretch
amused
me
by
the
blasphemies
which
he
mingled
with
prayers
to
his
patron
saint
francis
of
assisi
i
was
not
without
experience
of
such
accidents
and
was
not
at
all
hurt
for
one
safety
depends
a
good
deal
on
the
position
one
is
in
don
ciccio
had
probably
hurt
his
arm
by
stretching
it
out
just
as
the
accident
took
place
i
took
my
sword
my
musket
and
my
out
of
the
carriage
and
i
made
them
and
my
pockets
pistols
ready
so
as
to
offer
a
stiff
resistance
to
the
brigands
if
they
came
and
i
then
told
le
duc
to
take
some
money
and
ride
off
and
see
if
he
could
bring
some
peasants
to
our
assistance
don
ciccio
groaned
over
the
accident
but
i
resolving
to
sell
my
money
and
my
life
dearly
made
a
rampart
of
the
carriage
and
four
horses
and
stood
sentry
with
my
arms
ready
i
then
felt
prepared
for
all
hazards
and
was
quite
calm
but
my
unfortunate
companion
continued
to
pour
forth
his
groans
and
prayers
and
blasphemies
for
all
that
goes
together
at
naples
as
at
rome
i
could
do
nothing
but
compassionate
him
but
in
spite
of
myself
i
could
not
help
laughing
which
seemed
to
vex
the
poor
abbe
who
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
dying
dolphin
as
he
rested
motionless
against
the
bank
his
distress
may
be
imagined
when
the
nearest
horse
yielded
to
the
call
of
nature
and
voided
over
the
unfortunate
man
the
contents
of
its
bladder
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
and
i
could
not
help
roaring
with
laughter
nevertheless
a
strong
northerly
wind
rendered
our
situation
an
extremely
unpleasant
one
at
the
slightest
noise
i
cried
who
goes
there
threatening
to
fire
on
anyone
who
dared
approach
i
spent
two
hours
in
this
position
until
at
last
le
duc
rode
up
and
told
me
that
a
band
of
peasants
all
armed
and
provided
with
lanterns
were
approaching
to
our
assistance
in
less
than
an
hour
the
carriage
the
horses
and
alfani
were
seen
to
i
kept
two
of
the
to
serve
as
postillions
and
i
sent
the
others
away
well
paid
for
the
interruption
of
their
sleep
i
reached
agatha
at
and
i
made
the
devil
own
noise
at
the
door
of
the
postmaster
calling
for
an
attorney
to
take
down
my
statement
and
threatening
to
have
the
postillions
who
had
overturned
and
deserted
me
hanged
a
wheelwright
inspected
my
coach
and
pronounced
the
broken
and
told
me
i
should
have
to
remain
for
a
day
at
least
don
ciccio
who
stood
in
need
of
a
surgeon
aid
called
on
the
marquis
galliani
without
telling
me
anything
about
it
however
the
marquis
hastened
to
beg
me
to
stay
at
his
home
till
i
could
continue
my
journey
i
accepted
the
invitation
with
great
pleasure
and
with
this
my
ill
humour
which
was
really
only
the
result
of
my
desire
to
make
a
great
fuss
like
a
great
man
evaporated
the
marquis
ordered
my
carriage
to
be
taken
to
his
took
me
by
the
arm
and
led
me
to
his
house
he
was
as
learned
as
he
was
polite
and
a
perfect
neapolitan
devoid
of
all
ceremony
he
had
not
the
brilliant
wit
of
his
brother
whom
i
had
known
at
paris
as
secretary
of
embassy
under
the
count
cantillana
montdragon
but
he
possessed
a
judgment
founded
on
study
and
the
perusal
of
ancient
and
modern
classics
above
all
he
was
a
great
mathematician
and
was
then
preparing
an
annotated
edition
of
vitruvius
which
was
afterwards
published
the
marquis
introduced
me
to
his
wife
whom
i
knew
as
the
intimate
friend
of
my
dear
lucrezia
there
was
something
in
her
expression
and
to
see
her
surrounded
by
her
little
children
was
like
looking
at
a
picture
of
the
holy
family
don
ciccio
was
put
to
bed
directly
and
a
surgeon
sent
for
who
consoled
him
by
saying
that
it
was
only
a
simple
luxation
and
that
he
would
be
well
again
in
a
few
days
at
noon
a
carriage
stopped
at
the
door
and
lucrezia
got
down
she
embraced
the
marchioness
and
said
to
me
in
the
most
natural
manner
as
we
shook
hands
what
happy
chance
brings
you
hear
dear
don
giacomo
she
told
her
friend
that
i
was
a
friend
of
her
late
husband
and
that
she
had
recently
seen
me
again
with
great
pleasure
at
the
duke
de
matalone
after
dinner
on
finding
myself
alone
with
this
charming
woman
i
asked
her
if
it
were
not
possible
for
us
to
pass
a
happy
night
together
but
she
shewed
me
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
and
i
had
to
yield
i
renewed
my
offer
to
marry
her
buy
a
property
said
she
in
the
kingdom
of
naples
and
i
will
spend
the
remainder
of
my
days
with
you
without
asking
a
priest
to
give
us
his
blessing
unless
we
happen
to
have
children
i
could
not
deny
that
lucrezia
spoke
very
sensibly
and
i
could
easily
have
bought
land
in
naples
and
lived
comfortably
on
it
but
the
idea
of
binding
myself
down
to
one
place
was
so
contrary
to
my
feelings
that
i
had
the
good
sense
to
prefer
my
vagabond
life
to
all
the
advantages
which
our
union
would
have
given
me
and
i
do
not
think
that
lucrezia
altogether
disapproved
of
my
resolution
after
supper
i
took
leave
of
everybody
and
i
set
out
at
in
order
to
get
to
rome
by
the
next
day
i
had
only
fifteen
stages
to
do
and
the
road
was
excellent
as
we
were
getting
into
carillano
i
saw
one
of
the
carriages
locally
called
mantice
two
horses
were
being
put
into
it
while
my
carriage
required
four
i
got
out
and
on
hearing
myself
called
i
turned
round
i
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
find
that
the
occupants
of
the
mantice
were
a
young
and
pretty
girl
and
signora
diana
the
prince
de
sassaro
mistress
who
owed
me
three
hundred
ounces
she
told
me
that
she
was
going
to
rome
and
that
she
would
be
glad
if
we
could
make
the
journey
together
i
suppose
you
do
mind
stopping
for
the
night
at
piperno
no
said
i
i
am
afraid
that
ca
be
managed
i
do
intend
to
break
my
journey
but
you
would
get
to
rome
by
i
know
that
but
i
sleep
better
in
my
carriage
than
in
the
bad
beds
they
give
you
in
the
inns
i
dare
not
travel
by
night
well
well
madam
i
have
no
doubt
we
shall
see
each
other
at
rome
you
are
a
cruel
man
you
see
i
have
only
a
stupid
servant
and
a
maid
who
is
as
timid
as
i
am
besides
it
is
cold
and
my
carriage
is
open
i
will
keep
you
company
in
yours
i
really
ca
take
you
in
as
all
the
available
space
is
taken
up
by
my
old
secretary
who
broke
his
arm
yesterday
shall
we
dine
together
at
terracino
we
could
have
a
little
talk
certainly
we
made
good
cheer
at
this
small
town
which
is
the
frontier
of
the
states
of
the
church
we
should
not
reach
piperno
till
far
on
in
the
night
and
the
lady
renewed
and
redoubled
her
efforts
to
keep
me
till
daybreak
but
though
young
and
pretty
she
did
not
take
my
fancy
she
was
too
fair
and
too
fat
but
her
maid
who
was
a
pretty
brunette
with
a
delicious
rounded
form
and
a
sparkling
eye
excited
all
my
feelings
of
desire
a
vague
hope
of
possessing
the
maid
won
me
over
and
i
ended
by
promising
the
signora
to
sup
with
her
and
not
to
continue
my
journey
without
giving
notice
to
the
landlord
when
we
got
to
piperno
i
succeeded
in
telling
the
pretty
maid
that
if
she
would
let
me
have
her
quietly
i
would
not
go
any
further
she
promised
to
wait
for
me
and
allowed
me
to
take
such
liberties
as
are
usually
the
signs
of
perfect
complaisance
we
had
our
supper
and
i
wished
the
ladies
good
night
and
escorted
them
to
their
room
where
i
took
note
of
the
relative
positions
of
their
beds
so
that
there
should
be
no
mistake
i
left
them
and
came
back
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
finding
the
door
open
i
felt
sure
of
success
and
i
got
into
bed
but
as
i
found
out
it
was
the
signora
and
not
the
maid
who
received
me
evidently
the
little
hussy
had
told
her
mistress
the
story
and
the
mistress
had
thought
fit
to
take
the
maid
place
there
was
no
possibility
of
my
being
mistaken
for
though
i
could
not
see
i
could
feel
for
a
moment
i
was
undecided
should
i
remain
in
bed
and
make
the
best
of
what
i
had
got
or
go
on
my
way
to
rome
immediately
the
latter
counsel
prevailed
i
called
le
duc
gave
my
orders
and
started
enjoying
the
thought
of
the
confusion
of
the
two
women
who
must
have
been
in
a
great
rage
at
the
failure
of
their
plans
i
saw
signora
diana
three
or
four
times
at
rome
and
we
bowed
without
speaking
if
i
had
thought
it
likely
that
she
would
pay
me
the
four
hundred
louis
she
owed
me
i
might
have
taken
the
trouble
to
call
on
her
but
i
know
that
your
stage
queens
are
the
worst
debtors
in
the
world
my
brother
the
chevalier
mengs
and
the
abbe
winckelmann
were
all
in
good
health
and
spirits
costa
was
delighted
to
see
me
again
i
sent
him
off
directly
to
his
holiness
maggiore
to
warn
him
that
i
was
coming
to
take
polenta
with
him
and
all
he
need
do
was
to
get
a
good
supper
for
twelve
i
was
sure
of
finding
mariuccia
there
for
i
knew
that
momolo
had
noticed
her
presence
pleased
me
the
carnival
began
the
day
after
my
arrival
and
i
hired
a
superb
landau
for
the
whole
week
the
roman
landaus
seat
four
people
and
have
a
hood
which
may
be
lowered
at
pleasure
in
these
landaus
one
drives
along
the
corso
with
or
without
masks
from
nine
to
twelve
during
the
carnival
time
from
time
immemorial
the
corso
at
rome
has
presented
a
strange
and
diverting
spectacle
during
the
carnival
the
horses
start
from
the
piazza
del
popolo
and
gallop
along
to
the
column
of
trajan
between
two
lines
of
carriages
drawn
up
beside
two
narrow
pavements
which
are
crowded
with
maskers
and
people
of
all
classes
all
the
windows
are
decorated
as
soon
as
the
horses
have
passed
the
carriages
begin
to
move
and
the
maskers
on
foot
and
horseback
occupy
the
middle
of
the
street
the
air
is
full
of
real
and
false
sweetmeats
pamphlets
pasquinades
and
puns
throughout
the
mob
composed
of
the
best
and
worst
classes
of
rome
liberty
reigns
supreme
and
when
twelve
is
announced
by
the
third
report
of
the
cannon
of
angelo
the
corso
begins
to
clear
and
in
five
minutes
you
would
look
in
vain
for
a
carriage
or
a
masker
the
crowd
disperses
amongst
the
neighbouring
streets
and
fills
the
opera
houses
the
theatres
the
exhibitions
and
even
the
the
restaurants
and
taverns
are
not
left
desolate
everywhere
you
will
find
crowds
of
people
for
during
the
carnival
the
romans
only
think
of
eating
drinking
and
enjoying
themselves
i
banked
my
money
with
belloni
and
got
a
letter
of
credit
on
turin
where
i
expected
to
find
the
abbe
gama
and
to
receive
a
commission
to
represent
the
portuguese
court
at
the
congress
of
augsburg
to
which
all
europe
was
looking
forward
and
then
i
went
to
inspect
my
little
room
where
i
hoped
to
meet
mariuccia
the
next
day
i
found
everything
in
good
order
in
the
evening
momolo
and
his
family
received
me
with
joyful
exclamations
the
eldest
daughter
said
with
a
smile
that
she
was
sure
she
would
please
me
by
sending
for
mariuccia
you
are
right
said
i
i
shall
be
delighted
to
see
the
fair
mariuccia
a
few
minutes
after
she
entered
with
her
puritanical
mother
who
told
me
i
must
not
be
surprised
to
see
her
daughter
better
dressed
as
she
was
going
to
be
married
in
a
few
days
i
congratulated
her
and
daughters
asked
who
was
the
happy
man
mariuccia
blushed
and
said
modestly
to
one
of
them
it
is
somebody
whom
you
know
so
and
so
he
saw
me
here
and
we
are
going
to
open
a
shop
the
marriage
was
arranged
by
good
father
barnabe
added
the
mother
he
has
in
his
keeping
my
daughter
dower
of
four
hundred
roman
crowns
he
a
good
lad
said
momolo
i
have
a
high
opinion
of
him
he
would
have
married
one
of
my
daughters
if
i
could
have
given
him
such
a
dowry
at
these
words
the
girl
in
question
blushed
and
lowered
her
eyes
never
mind
my
dear
said
i
your
turn
will
come
in
time
she
took
my
words
as
seriously
meant
and
her
face
lit
up
with
joy
she
thought
i
had
guessed
her
love
for
costa
and
her
idea
was
confirmed
when
i
told
him
to
get
my
landau
the
next
day
and
take
out
all
daughters
well
masked
as
it
would
not
do
for
them
to
be
recognized
in
a
carriage
i
meant
to
make
use
of
myself
i
also
bade
him
hire
some
handsome
costumes
from
a
jew
and
paid
the
myself
this
put
them
all
in
a
good
humour
how
about
signora
maria
said
the
jealous
sister
as
signora
maria
is
going
to
be
married
i
replied
she
must
not
be
present
at
any
festivity
without
her
future
husband
the
mother
applauded
this
decision
of
mine
and
sly
mariuccia
pretended
to
feel
mortified
i
turned
to
momolo
and
begged
him
to
ask
future
husband
to
meet
me
at
supper
by
which
i
pleased
her
mother
greatly
i
felt
very
tired
and
having
nothing
to
keep
me
after
seeing
mariuccia
i
begged
the
company
to
excuse
me
and
after
wishing
them
a
good
appetite
i
left
them
i
walked
out
next
morning
at
an
early
hour
i
had
no
need
of
going
into
the
church
which
i
reached
at
seven
for
mariuccia
saw
me
at
some
distance
off
and
followed
me
and
we
were
soon
alone
together
in
the
little
room
which
love
and
voluptuous
pleasure
had
transmuted
into
a
sumptuous
place
we
would
gladly
have
talked
to
each
other
but
as
we
had
only
an
hour
before
us
we
set
to
without
even
taking
off
our
clothes
after
the
last
kiss
which
ended
the
third
assault
she
told
me
that
she
was
to
be
married
on
the
eve
of
shrove
tuesday
and
that
all
had
been
arranged
by
her
confessor
she
also
thanked
me
for
having
asked
momolo
to
invite
her
intended
when
shall
we
see
each
other
again
my
angel
on
sunday
the
eve
of
my
wedding
we
shall
be
able
to
spend
four
hours
together
delightful
i
promise
you
that
when
you
leave
me
you
will
be
in
such
a
state
that
the
caresses
of
your
husband
wo
hurt
you
she
smiled
and
departed
and
i
threw
myself
on
the
bed
where
i
rested
for
a
good
hour
as
i
was
going
home
i
met
a
carriage
and
four
going
at
a
great
speed
a
footman
rode
in
front
of
the
carriage
and
within
it
i
saw
a
young
nobleman
my
attention
was
arrested
by
the
blue
ribbon
on
his
breast
i
gazed
at
him
and
he
called
out
my
name
and
had
the
carriage
stopped
i
was
extremely
surprised
when
i
found
it
was
lord
whom
i
had
known
at
paris
at
his
mother
the
countess
of
lismore
who
was
separated
from
her
husband
and
was
the
kept
mistress
of
de
aubin
the
unworthy
successor
of
the
good
and
virtuous
fenelon
in
the
archbishopric
of
cambrai
however
the
archbishop
owed
his
promotion
to
the
fact
that
he
was
a
bastard
of
the
duc
the
french
regent
lord
was
a
young
man
with
wit
and
talent
but
the
slave
of
his
unbridled
passions
and
of
every
species
of
vice
i
knew
that
if
he
were
lord
in
name
he
was
not
so
in
fortune
and
i
was
astonished
to
see
him
driving
such
a
handsome
carriage
and
still
more
so
at
his
blue
ribbon
in
a
few
words
he
told
me
that
he
was
going
to
dine
with
the
pretender
but
that
he
would
sup
at
home
he
invited
me
to
come
to
supper
and
i
accepted
after
dinner
i
took
a
short
walk
and
then
went
to
enliven
myself
at
the
theatre
where
i
saw
momolo
girls
strutting
about
with
costa
afterwards
i
went
to
lord
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
meet
the
poet
poinsinet
he
was
young
short
ugly
full
of
poetic
fire
a
wit
and
dramatist
five
or
six
years
later
the
poor
fellow
fell
into
the
guadalquivir
and
was
drowned
he
had
gone
to
madrid
in
the
hope
of
making
his
fortune
as
i
had
known
him
at
paris
i
addressed
him
as
an
old
acquaintance
what
are
you
doing
at
rome
where
my
lord
he
in
the
next
room
but
as
his
father
is
dead
his
title
is
now
earl
of
lismore
you
know
he
was
an
adherent
of
the
pretender
i
left
paris
with
him
well
enough
pleased
at
being
able
to
come
to
rome
without
its
costing
me
anything
then
the
earl
is
a
rich
man
now
not
exactly
but
he
will
be
as
he
is
his
father
heir
and
the
old
earl
left
an
immense
fortune
it
is
true
that
it
is
all
confiscated
but
that
is
nothing
as
his
claims
are
irresistible
in
short
he
is
rich
in
claims
and
rich
in
the
future
but
how
did
he
get
himself
made
a
knight
of
one
of
the
french
king
orders
you
joking
that
is
the
blue
ribbon
of
the
order
of
michael
of
which
the
late
elector
of
cologne
was
grand
master
as
you
know
my
lord
plays
exquisitely
on
the
violin
and
when
he
was
at
bonn
he
played
the
elector
a
concerto
by
tartini
the
prince
could
not
find
words
in
which
to
express
the
pleasure
of
my
lord
performance
and
gave
him
the
ribbon
you
have
seen
a
fine
present
doubtless
you
do
know
what
pleasure
it
gave
my
lord
for
when
we
go
back
to
paris
everybody
will
take
it
for
the
order
of
the
holy
ghost
we
passed
into
a
large
room
where
we
found
the
earl
with
the
party
he
had
asked
to
supper
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
embraced
me
called
me
his
dear
friend
and
named
his
guests
there
were
seven
or
eight
girls
all
of
them
pretty
three
or
four
castrati
who
played
women
parts
in
the
roman
theatre
and
five
or
six
abbes
the
husband
of
every
wife
and
the
wives
of
every
husband
who
boasted
of
their
wickedness
and
challenged
the
girls
to
be
more
shameless
than
they
the
girls
were
not
common
courtezans
but
past
mistresses
of
music
painting
and
vice
considered
as
a
fine
art
the
kind
of
society
may
be
imagined
when
i
say
that
i
found
myself
a
perfect
novice
amongst
them
where
are
you
going
prince
said
the
earl
to
a
man
who
was
making
for
the
door
i
do
feel
well
my
lord
i
think
i
must
go
out
what
prince
is
that
said
i
the
prince
de
chimai
he
is
a
and
is
endeavouring
to
gain
permission
to
marry
lest
his
family
should
become
extinct
i
admire
his
prudence
or
his
delicacy
but
i
am
afraid
i
should
not
imitate
him
there
were
of
us
at
table
and
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
we
emptied
a
hundred
bottles
of
the
choicest
wines
everybody
was
drunk
with
the
exception
of
myself
and
the
poet
poinsinet
who
had
taken
nothing
but
water
the
company
rose
from
table
and
then
began
a
foul
orgy
which
i
should
never
have
conceived
possible
and
which
no
pen
could
describe
though
possibly
a
seasoned
profligate
might
get
some
idea
of
it
a
castrato
and
a
girl
of
almost
equal
height
proposed
to
strip
in
an
adjoining
room
and
to
lie
on
their
backs
in
the
same
bed
with
their
faces
covered
they
challenged
us
all
to
guess
which
was
which
we
all
went
in
and
nobody
could
pronounce
from
sight
which
was
male
and
which
was
female
so
i
bet
the
earl
fifty
crowns
that
i
would
point
out
the
woman
he
accepted
the
wager
and
i
guessed
correctly
but
payment
was
out
of
the
question
this
first
act
of
the
orgy
ended
with
the
prostitution
of
the
two
individuals
who
defied
everybody
to
accomplish
the
great
act
all
with
the
exception
of
poinsinet
and
myself
made
the
attempt
but
their
efforts
were
in
vain
the
second
act
displayed
four
or
five
couples
reversed
and
here
the
abbes
shone
both
in
the
active
and
passive
parts
of
this
lascivious
spectacle
i
was
the
only
person
respected
all
at
once
the
earl
who
had
hitherto
remained
perfectly
motionless
attacked
the
wretched
poinsinet
who
in
vain
attempted
to
defend
himself
he
had
to
strip
like
my
lord
who
was
as
naked
as
the
others
we
stood
round
in
a
circle
suddenly
the
earl
taking
his
watch
promised
it
to
the
first
who
succeeded
in
giving
them
a
sure
mark
of
sensibility
the
desire
of
gaining
the
prize
excited
the
impure
crowd
immensely
and
the
castrati
the
girls
and
the
abbes
all
did
their
utmost
each
one
striving
to
be
the
first
they
had
to
draw
lots
this
part
interested
me
most
for
throughout
this
almost
incredible
scene
of
debauchery
i
did
not
experience
the
slightest
sensation
although
under
other
circumstances
any
of
the
girls
would
have
claimed
my
homage
but
all
i
did
was
to
laugh
especially
to
see
the
poor
poet
in
terror
of
experiencing
the
lust
of
the
flesh
for
the
profligate
nobleman
swore
that
if
he
made
him
lose
he
would
deliver
him
up
to
the
brutal
lust
of
all
the
abbes
he
escaped
probably
through
fear
of
the
consequences
the
orgy
came
to
an
end
when
nobody
had
any
further
hopes
of
getting
the
watch
the
secret
of
the
lesbians
was
only
employed
however
by
the
abbes
and
the
castrata
the
girls
wishing
to
be
able
to
despise
those
who
made
use
of
it
refrained
from
doing
so
i
suspect
they
were
actuated
by
pride
rather
than
shame
as
they
might
possibly
have
employed
it
without
success
this
vile
debauch
disgusted
me
and
yet
gave
me
a
better
knowledge
of
myself
i
could
not
help
confessing
that
my
life
had
been
endangered
for
the
only
arm
i
had
was
my
sword
but
i
should
certainly
have
used
it
if
the
earl
had
tried
to
treat
me
like
the
others
and
as
he
had
treated
poor
poinsinet
i
never
understood
how
it
was
that
he
respected
me
for
he
was
quite
drunk
and
in
a
kind
of
bacchic
fury
as
i
left
i
promised
to
come
and
see
him
as
often
as
he
pleased
but
i
promised
myself
never
to
set
foot
in
his
house
again
next
day
he
came
to
see
me
in
the
afternoon
and
asked
me
to
walk
with
him
to
the
villa
medici
i
complimented
him
on
the
immense
wealth
he
had
inherited
to
enable
him
to
live
so
splendidly
but
he
laughed
and
told
me
that
he
did
not
possess
fifty
piastres
that
his
father
had
left
nothing
but
debts
and
that
he
himself
already
owed
three
or
four
thousand
crowns
i
wonder
people
give
you
credit
then
they
give
me
credit
because
everybody
knows
that
i
have
drawn
a
bill
of
exchange
on
paris
to
the
tune
of
two
hundred
thousand
francs
but
in
four
or
five
days
the
bill
will
be
returned
protested
and
i
am
only
waiting
for
that
to
happen
to
make
my
escape
if
you
are
certain
of
its
being
protested
i
advise
you
to
make
your
escape
for
as
it
is
so
large
a
sum
it
may
be
taken
up
before
it
is
due
no
i
wo
do
that
i
have
one
hope
left
i
have
written
to
tell
my
mother
that
i
shall
be
undone
if
she
does
not
furnish
the
banker
on
whom
i
have
drawn
the
bill
with
sufficient
funds
and
if
she
does
that
the
bill
will
be
accepted
you
know
my
mother
is
very
fond
of
me
yes
but
i
also
know
that
she
is
far
from
rich
true
but
de
aubin
is
rich
enough
and
between
you
and
me
i
think
he
is
my
father
meanwhile
my
creditors
are
almost
as
quiet
as
i
am
all
those
girls
you
saw
yesterday
would
give
me
all
they
have
if
i
asked
them
as
they
are
all
expecting
me
to
make
them
a
handsome
present
in
the
course
of
the
week
but
i
wo
abuse
their
trust
in
me
but
i
am
afraid
i
shall
be
obliged
to
cheat
the
jew
who
wants
me
to
give
him
three
thousand
sequins
for
this
ring
as
i
know
it
is
only
worth
one
thousand
he
will
send
the
police
after
you
i
defy
him
to
do
whatever
he
likes
the
ring
was
set
with
a
diamond
of
nine
or
ten
carats
he
begged
me
to
keep
his
secret
as
we
parted
i
did
not
feel
any
sentiments
of
pity
for
this
extravagant
madman
as
i
only
saw
in
him
a
man
unfortunate
by
his
own
fault
whose
fate
would
probably
make
him
end
his
days
in
a
prison
unless
he
had
the
courage
to
blow
his
brains
out
i
went
to
momolo
in
the
evening
and
found
the
intended
husband
of
my
fair
mariuccia
there
but
not
the
lady
herself
i
heard
she
had
sent
word
to
the
santissimo
that
as
her
father
had
come
from
palestrina
to
be
present
at
her
wedding
she
could
not
come
to
supper
i
admired
her
subtlety
a
young
girl
has
no
need
of
being
instructed
in
diplomacy
nature
and
her
own
heart
are
her
teachers
and
she
never
blunders
at
supper
i
studied
the
young
man
and
found
him
eminently
suitable
for
mariuccia
he
was
handsome
modest
and
intelligent
and
whatever
he
said
was
spoken
frankly
and
to
the
point
he
told
me
before
momolo
daughter
tecla
that
he
would
have
married
her
if
she
had
possessed
means
to
enable
him
to
open
his
shop
and
that
he
had
reason
to
thank
god
for
having
met
maria
whose
confessor
had
been
such
a
true
spiritual
father
to
her
i
asked
him
where
the
wedding
festivities
were
to
take
place
and
he
told
me
they
were
to
be
at
his
father
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
tiber
as
his
father
who
kept
a
garden
was
poor
he
had
furnished
him
with
ten
crowns
to
defray
the
expenses
i
wanted
to
give
him
the
ten
crowns
but
how
was
i
to
do
it
it
would
have
betrayed
me
is
your
father
garden
a
pretty
one
i
asked
not
exactly
pretty
but
very
well
kept
as
he
owns
the
land
he
has
separated
a
plot
which
he
wants
to
sell
it
would
bring
in
twenty
crowns
a
year
and
i
should
be
as
happy
as
a
cardinal
if
i
could
buy
it
how
much
will
it
cost
it
a
heavy
price
two
hundred
crowns
why
that
cheap
listen
to
me
i
have
met
your
future
bride
at
this
house
and
i
have
found
her
all
worthy
of
happiness
she
deserves
an
honest
young
fellow
like
you
for
a
husband
now
what
would
you
do
supposing
i
were
to
make
you
a
present
of
two
hundred
crowns
to
buy
the
garden
i
should
put
it
to
my
wife
dowry
then
here
are
the
two
hundred
crowns
i
shall
give
them
to
momolo
as
i
do
know
you
well
enough
though
i
think
you
are
perfectly
to
be
trusted
the
garden
is
yours
as
part
of
your
wife
dowry
momolo
took
the
money
and
promised
to
buy
the
garden
the
following
day
and
the
young
man
shedding
tears
of
joy
and
gratitude
fell
on
his
knees
and
kissed
my
hand
all
the
girls
wept
as
i
myself
did
for
there
a
contagion
in
such
happy
tears
nevertheless
they
did
not
all
proceed
from
the
same
source
some
were
virtuous
and
some
vicious
and
the
young
man
were
the
only
ones
whose
source
was
pure
and
unalloyed
i
lifted
him
from
the
ground
kissed
him
and
wished
him
a
happy
marriage
he
made
bold
to
ask
me
to
his
wedding
but
i
refused
thanking
him
kindly
i
told
him
that
if
he
wanted
to
please
me
he
must
come
and
sup
at
momolo
on
the
eve
of
his
wedding
and
i
begged
the
good
scopatore
to
ask
mariuccia
her
father
and
mother
as
well
i
was
sure
of
seeing
her
for
the
last
time
on
the
sunday
morning
at
seven
on
the
sunday
morning
we
were
in
each
other
arms
with
four
hours
before
us
after
the
first
burst
of
mutual
ardour
she
told
me
that
all
arrangements
had
been
made
in
her
house
the
evening
before
in
the
presence
of
her
confessor
and
of
momolo
and
that
on
the
receipt
for
the
two
hundred
crowns
being
handed
in
the
notary
had
put
the
garden
into
the
settlement
and
that
the
good
father
had
made
her
a
present
of
twenty
piastres
towards
defraying
the
notary
fees
and
the
wedding
expenses
everything
is
for
the
best
and
i
am
sure
i
shall
be
happy
my
intended
adores
you
but
you
did
wisely
not
to
accept
his
invitation
for
you
would
have
found
everything
so
poor
and
besides
tongues
might
have
been
set
wagging
to
my
disadvantage
you
are
quite
right
dearest
but
what
do
you
intend
to
do
if
your
husband
finds
that
the
door
has
been
opened
by
someone
else
for
possibly
he
expects
you
to
be
a
maid
i
expect
he
will
know
no
more
about
it
than
i
did
the
first
time
you
knew
me
besides
i
do
not
feel
that
you
have
defiled
me
and
my
clean
conscience
will
not
allow
me
to
think
of
the
matter
and
i
am
sure
that
he
will
not
think
of
it
any
more
than
i
yes
but
if
he
does
it
would
not
be
delicate
on
his
part
but
what
should
prevent
me
from
replying
that
i
do
know
what
he
means
you
are
right
that
the
best
way
but
have
you
told
your
confessor
of
our
mutual
enjoyment
no
for
as
i
did
not
give
myself
up
to
you
with
any
criminal
intention
i
do
not
think
i
have
offended
god
you
are
an
angel
and
i
admire
the
clearness
of
your
reasoning
but
listen
to
me
it
possible
that
you
are
already
with
child
or
that
you
may
become
so
this
morning
promise
to
name
the
child
after
me
i
will
do
so
the
four
hours
sped
rapidly
away
after
the
sixth
assault
we
were
wearied
though
not
satiated
we
parted
with
tears
and
swore
to
love
each
other
as
brother
and
sister
ever
after
i
went
home
bathed
slept
an
hour
rose
dressed
and
dined
pleasantly
with
the
family
in
the
evening
i
took
the
mengs
family
for
a
drive
in
my
landau
and
we
then
went
to
the
theatre
where
the
castrato
who
played
the
prima
donna
was
a
great
attraction
he
was
the
favourite
pathic
of
cardinal
borghese
and
supped
every
evening
with
his
eminence
this
castrato
had
a
fine
voice
but
his
chief
attraction
was
his
beauty
i
had
seen
him
in
man
clothes
in
the
street
but
though
a
fellow
he
had
not
made
any
impression
on
me
for
one
could
see
at
once
that
he
was
only
half
a
man
but
on
the
stage
in
woman
dress
the
illusion
was
complete
he
was
ravishing
he
was
enclosed
in
a
corset
and
looked
like
a
nymph
and
incredible
though
it
may
seem
his
breast
was
as
beautiful
as
any
woman
it
was
the
monster
chiefest
charm
however
well
one
knew
the
fellow
neutral
sex
as
soon
as
one
looked
at
his
breast
one
felt
all
aglow
and
quite
madly
amorous
of
him
to
feel
nothing
one
would
have
to
be
as
cold
and
impassive
as
a
german
as
he
walked
the
boards
waiting
for
the
refrain
of
the
air
he
was
singing
there
was
something
grandly
voluptuous
about
him
and
as
he
glanced
towards
the
boxes
his
black
eyes
at
once
tender
and
modest
ravished
the
heart
he
evidently
wished
to
fan
the
flame
of
those
who
loved
him
as
a
man
and
probably
would
not
have
cared
for
him
if
he
had
been
a
woman
rome
the
holy
which
thus
strives
to
make
all
men
pederasts
denies
the
fact
and
will
not
believe
in
the
effects
of
the
glamour
of
her
own
devising
i
made
these
reflections
aloud
and
an
ecclesiastic
wishing
to
blind
me
to
the
truth
spoke
as
follows
you
are
quite
right
why
should
this
castrato
be
allowed
to
shew
his
breast
of
which
the
fairest
roman
lady
might
be
proud
and
yet
wish
everyone
to
consider
him
as
a
man
and
not
a
woman
if
the
stage
is
forbidden
to
the
fair
sex
lest
they
excite
desires
why
do
they
seek
out
made
in
the
form
of
women
who
excite
much
more
criminal
desires
they
keep
on
preaching
that
pederasty
is
comparatively
unknown
and
entraps
only
a
few
but
many
clever
men
endeavour
to
be
entrapped
and
end
by
thinking
it
so
pleasant
that
they
prefer
these
monsters
to
the
most
beautiful
women
the
pope
would
be
sure
of
heaven
if
he
put
a
stop
to
this
scandalous
practice
i
do
agree
with
you
one
could
not
have
a
pretty
actress
to
supper
without
causing
a
scandal
but
such
an
invitation
to
a
castrato
makes
nobody
talk
it
is
of
course
known
perfectly
well
that
after
supper
both
heads
rest
on
one
pillow
but
what
everybody
knows
is
ignored
by
all
one
may
sleep
with
a
man
out
of
mere
friendship
it
is
not
so
with
a
woman
true
monsignor
appearances
are
saved
and
a
sin
concealed
is
half
pardoned
as
they
say
in
paris
at
rome
we
say
it
is
pardoned
altogether
nascosto
non
offende
his
jesuitical
arguments
interested
me
for
i
knew
that
he
was
an
avowed
partisan
of
the
forbidden
fruit
in
one
of
the
boxes
i
saw
the
marchioness
passarini
whom
i
had
known
at
dresden
with
don
antonio
borghese
and
i
went
to
pay
my
addresses
to
them
the
prince
whom
i
had
known
at
paris
ten
years
before
recognized
me
and
asked
me
to
dine
with
him
on
the
following
day
i
went
but
my
lord
was
not
at
home
a
page
told
me
that
my
place
was
laid
at
table
and
that
i
could
dine
just
as
if
the
prince
was
there
on
which
i
turned
my
back
on
him
and
went
away
on
ash
wednesday
he
sent
his
man
to
ask
me
to
sup
with
him
and
the
marchioness
who
was
his
mistress
and
i
sent
word
that
i
would
not
fail
to
come
but
he
waited
for
me
in
vain
pride
is
the
daughter
of
folly
and
always
keeps
its
mother
nature
after
the
opera
i
went
to
momolo
where
i
found
mariuccia
her
father
her
mother
and
her
future
husband
they
were
anxiously
expecting
me
it
is
not
difficult
to
make
people
happy
when
one
selects
for
one
bounty
persons
who
really
deserve
happiness
i
was
amidst
poor
but
honest
people
and
i
can
truly
say
that
i
had
a
delightful
supper
it
may
be
that
some
of
my
enjoyment
proceeded
from
a
feeling
of
vanity
for
i
knew
that
i
was
the
author
of
the
happiness
depicted
on
the
faces
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
and
of
the
father
and
mother
of
mariuccia
but
when
vanity
causes
good
deeds
it
is
a
virtue
nevertheless
i
owe
it
to
myself
to
tell
my
readers
that
my
pleasure
was
too
pure
to
have
in
it
any
admixture
of
vice
after
supper
i
made
a
small
bank
at
faro
making
everybody
play
with
counters
as
nobody
had
a
penny
and
i
was
so
fortunate
as
to
make
everyone
win
a
few
ducats
after
the
game
we
danced
in
spite
of
the
prohibition
of
the
pope
whom
no
roman
can
believe
to
be
infallible
for
he
forbids
dancing
and
permits
games
of
chance
his
successor
ganganelli
followed
the
opposite
course
and
was
no
better
obeyed
to
avoid
suspicion
i
did
not
give
the
pair
any
present
but
i
gave
up
my
landau
to
them
that
they
might
enjoy
the
carnival
on
the
corso
and
i
told
costa
to
get
them
a
box
at
the
capranica
theatre
momolo
asked
me
to
supper
on
shrove
tuesday
i
wished
to
leave
rome
on
the
second
day
of
lent
and
i
called
on
the
holy
father
at
a
time
when
all
rome
was
on
the
corso
his
holiness
welcomed
me
most
graciously
and
said
he
was
surprised
that
i
had
not
gone
to
see
the
sights
on
the
corso
like
everybody
else
i
replied
that
as
a
lover
of
pleasure
i
had
chosen
the
greatest
pleasure
of
all
for
a
christian
namely
to
kneel
at
the
feet
of
the
vicar
of
christ
on
earth
he
bowed
with
a
kind
of
majestic
humility
which
shewed
me
how
the
compliment
had
pleased
him
he
kept
me
for
more
than
an
hour
talking
about
venice
padua
and
paris
which
latter
city
the
worthy
man
would
not
have
been
sorry
to
have
visited
i
again
commended
myself
to
his
apostolic
intercession
to
enable
me
to
return
to
my
native
country
and
he
replied
have
recourse
to
god
dear
son
his
grace
will
be
more
efficacious
than
my
prayers
and
then
he
blessed
me
and
wished
me
a
prosperous
journey
i
saw
that
the
head
of
the
church
had
no
great
opinion
of
his
own
power
on
shrove
tuesday
i
dressed
myself
richly
in
the
costume
of
polichinello
and
rode
along
the
corso
showering
sweetmeats
on
all
the
pretty
women
i
saw
finally
i
emptied
the
basket
on
the
daughters
of
the
worthy
whom
costa
was
taking
about
in
my
landau
with
all
the
dignity
of
a
pasha
at
i
took
off
my
costume
and
went
to
momolo
where
i
expected
to
see
dear
mariuccia
for
the
last
time
supper
passed
off
in
almost
a
similar
manner
to
the
supper
of
last
sunday
but
there
was
an
interesting
novelty
for
me
namely
the
sight
of
my
beloved
mistress
in
her
character
of
bride
her
husband
seemed
to
be
much
more
reserved
with
respect
to
me
than
at
our
first
meeting
i
was
puzzled
by
his
behaviour
and
sat
down
by
mariuccia
and
proceeded
to
question
her
she
told
me
all
the
circumstances
which
had
passed
on
the
first
night
and
she
spoke
highly
of
her
husband
good
qualities
he
was
kind
amorous
and
delicate
no
doubt
he
must
have
noticed
that
the
casket
had
been
opened
but
he
had
said
nothing
about
it
as
he
had
spoken
about
me
she
had
not
been
able
to
resist
the
pleasure
of
telling
him
that
i
was
her
sole
benefactor
at
which
so
far
from
being
offended
he
seemed
to
trust
in
her
more
than
ever
but
has
he
not
questioned
you
indirectly
as
to
the
connection
between
us
not
at
all
i
told
him
that
you
went
to
my
confessor
after
having
spoken
to
me
once
only
in
the
church
where
i
told
you
what
a
good
chance
i
had
of
being
married
to
him
do
you
think
he
believed
you
i
am
not
sure
however
even
if
it
were
otherwise
it
is
enough
that
he
pretends
to
for
i
am
determined
to
win
his
esteem
you
are
right
and
i
think
all
the
better
of
him
for
his
suspicions
for
it
is
better
to
marry
a
man
with
some
sense
in
his
head
than
to
marry
a
fool
i
was
so
pleased
with
what
she
told
me
that
when
i
took
leave
of
the
company
i
embraced
the
hairdresser
and
drawing
a
handsome
gold
watch
from
my
fob
i
begged
him
to
accept
it
as
a
souvenir
of
me
he
received
it
with
the
utmost
gratitude
from
my
pocket
i
took
a
ring
worth
at
least
six
hundred
francs
and
put
it
on
his
wife
finger
wishing
them
a
fair
posterity
and
all
manner
of
happiness
and
i
then
went
home
to
bed
telling
le
duc
and
costa
that
we
must
begin
to
pack
up
next
day
i
was
just
getting
up
when
they
brought
me
a
note
from
lord
lismore
begging
me
to
come
and
speak
to
him
at
noon
at
the
villa
borghese
i
had
some
suspicion
of
what
he
might
want
and
kept
the
appointment
i
felt
in
a
mood
to
give
him
some
good
advice
indeed
considering
the
friendship
between
his
mother
and
myself
it
was
my
duty
to
do
so
he
came
up
to
me
and
gave
me
a
letter
he
had
received
the
evening
before
from
his
mother
she
told
him
that
paris
de
monmartel
had
just
informed
her
that
he
was
in
possession
of
a
bill
for
two
hundred
thousand
francs
drawn
by
her
son
and
that
he
would
honour
it
if
she
would
furnish
him
with
the
funds
she
had
replied
that
she
would
let
him
know
in
two
or
three
days
if
she
could
do
so
but
she
warned
her
son
that
she
had
only
asked
for
this
delay
to
give
him
time
to
escape
as
the
bill
would
certainly
be
protested
and
returned
it
being
absolutely
out
of
the
question
for
her
to
get
the
money
you
had
better
make
yourself
scarce
as
soon
as
you
can
said
i
returning
him
the
letter
buy
this
ring
and
so
furnish
me
with
the
means
for
my
escape
you
would
not
know
that
it
was
not
my
property
if
i
had
not
told
you
so
in
confidence
i
made
an
appointment
with
him
and
had
the
stone
taken
out
and
valued
by
one
of
the
best
jewellers
in
rome
i
know
this
stone
said
he
it
is
worth
two
thousand
roman
crowns
at
four
i
took
the
earl
five
hundred
crowns
in
gold
and
fifteen
hundred
crowns
in
paper
which
he
would
have
to
take
to
a
banker
who
would
give
him
a
bill
of
exchange
in
amsterdam
i
will
be
off
at
nightfall
said
he
and
travel
by
myself
to
amsterdam
only
taking
such
effects
as
are
absolutely
necessary
and
my
beloved
blue
ribbon
a
pleasant
journey
to
you
said
i
and
left
him
in
ten
days
i
had
the
stone
mounted
at
bologna
i
got
a
letter
of
introduction
from
cardinal
albani
for
onorati
the
nuncio
at
florence
and
another
letter
from
mengs
to
sir
mann
whom
he
begged
to
receive
me
in
his
house
i
was
going
to
florence
for
the
sake
of
the
corticelli
and
my
dear
therese
and
i
reckoned
on
the
feigning
to
ignore
my
return
in
spite
of
his
unjust
order
especially
if
i
were
residing
at
the
english
minister
on
the
second
day
of
lent
the
disappearance
of
lord
lismore
was
the
talk
of
the
town
the
english
tailor
was
ruined
the
jew
who
owned
the
ring
was
in
despair
and
all
the
silly
fellow
servants
were
turned
out
of
the
house
in
almost
a
state
of
nakedness
as
the
tailor
had
unceremoniously
taken
possession
of
everything
in
the
way
of
clothes
that
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
poor
poinsinet
came
to
see
me
in
a
pitiable
condition
he
had
only
his
shirt
and
overcoat
he
had
been
despoiled
of
everything
and
threatened
with
imprisonment
i
have
a
farthing
said
the
poor
child
of
the
muses
i
have
only
the
shirt
on
my
back
i
know
nobody
here
and
i
think
i
shall
go
and
throw
myself
into
the
tiber
he
was
destined
not
to
be
drowned
in
the
tiber
but
in
the
guadalquivir
i
calmed
him
by
offering
to
take
him
to
florence
with
me
but
i
warned
him
that
i
must
leave
him
there
as
someone
was
expecting
me
at
florence
he
immediately
took
up
his
abode
with
me
and
wrote
verses
incessantly
till
it
was
time
to
go
my
brother
jean
made
me
a
present
of
an
onyx
of
great
beauty
it
was
a
cameo
representing
venus
bathing
and
a
genuine
antique
as
the
name
of
the
artist
sostrates
was
cut
on
the
stone
two
years
later
i
sold
it
to
masti
at
london
for
three
hundred
pounds
and
it
is
possibly
still
in
the
british
museum
i
went
my
way
with
poinsinet
who
amused
me
in
spite
of
his
sadness
with
his
droll
fancies
in
two
days
i
got
down
at
vannini
who
tried
to
conceal
his
surprise
at
seeing
me
i
lost
no
time
but
waited
on
sir
mann
immediately
and
found
him
sitting
at
table
he
gave
me
a
very
friendly
reception
but
he
seemed
alarmed
when
in
reply
to
his
question
i
told
him
that
my
dispute
with
the
auditor
had
not
been
arranged
he
told
me
plainly
that
he
thought
i
had
made
a
mistake
in
returning
to
florence
and
that
he
would
be
compromised
by
my
staying
with
him
i
pointed
out
that
i
was
only
passing
through
florence
that
all
very
well
said
he
but
you
know
you
ought
to
call
on
the
auditor
i
promised
to
do
so
and
returned
to
my
lodging
i
had
scarcely
shut
the
door
when
an
agent
of
police
came
and
told
me
that
the
auditor
had
something
to
say
to
me
and
would
be
glad
to
see
me
at
an
early
hour
next
morning
i
was
enraged
at
this
order
and
determined
to
start
forthwith
rather
than
obey
full
of
this
idea
i
called
on
therese
and
found
she
was
at
pisa
i
then
went
to
see
the
corticelli
who
threw
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
made
use
of
the
bolognese
grimaces
appropriate
to
the
occasion
to
speak
the
truth
although
the
girl
was
pretty
her
chief
merit
in
my
eyes
was
that
she
made
me
laugh
i
gave
some
money
to
her
mother
to
get
us
a
good
supper
and
i
took
the
girl
out
on
pretence
of
going
for
a
walk
i
went
with
her
to
my
lodging
and
left
her
with
poinsinet
and
going
to
another
room
i
summoned
costa
and
vannini
i
told
costa
in
vannini
presence
to
go
on
with
le
duc
and
my
luggage
the
following
day
and
to
call
for
me
at
the
pilgrim
at
bologna
i
gave
vannini
my
instructions
and
he
left
the
room
and
then
i
ordered
costa
to
leave
florence
with
signora
laura
and
her
son
and
to
tell
them
that
i
and
the
daughter
were
on
in
front
le
duc
received
similar
orders
and
calling
poinsinet
i
gave
him
ten
louis
and
begged
him
to
look
out
for
some
other
lodging
that
very
evening
the
worthy
but
unfortunate
young
man
wept
grateful
tears
and
told
me
that
he
would
set
out
for
parma
on
foot
next
day
and
that
there
tillot
would
do
some
thing
for
him
i
went
back
to
the
next
room
and
told
the
corticelli
to
come
with
me
she
did
so
under
the
impression
that
we
were
going
back
to
her
mother
but
without
taking
the
trouble
to
undeceive
her
i
had
a
carriage
and
pair
got
ready
and
told
the
postillion
to
drive
to
uccellatoio
the
first
post
on
the
bologna
road
where
in
the
world
are
we
going
said
she
bologna
how
about
mamma
she
will
come
on
does
she
know
about
it
no
but
she
will
when
costa
comes
to
tell
her
and
to
fetch
her
and
your
brother
she
liked
the
joke
and
got
into
the
carriage
laughing
and
we
drove
away
chapter
xi
my
arrival
at
bologna
i
am
expelled
from
modena
i
visit
parma
and
turin
the
pretty
jewess
the
dressmaker
the
corticelli
had
a
good
warm
mantle
but
the
fool
who
carried
her
off
had
no
cloak
even
of
the
most
meagre
kind
to
keep
off
the
piercing
cold
which
was
increased
by
a
keen
wind
blowing
right
in
our
faces
in
spite
of
all
i
would
not
halt
for
i
was
afraid
i
might
be
pursued
and
obliged
to
return
which
would
have
greatly
vexed
me
when
i
saw
that
the
postillion
was
slackening
his
speed
i
increased
the
amount
of
the
present
i
was
going
to
make
him
and
once
more
we
rushed
along
at
a
headlong
pace
i
felt
perishing
with
the
cold
while
the
postillions
seeing
me
so
lightly
clad
and
so
prodigal
of
my
money
to
speed
them
on
their
way
imagined
that
i
was
a
prince
carrying
off
the
heiress
of
some
noble
family
we
heard
them
talking
to
this
effect
while
they
changed
horses
and
the
corticelli
was
so
much
amused
that
she
did
nothing
but
laugh
for
the
rest
of
the
way
in
five
hours
we
covered
forty
miles
we
started
from
florence
at
eight
and
at
one
in
the
morning
we
stopped
at
a
post
in
the
pope
territory
where
i
had
nothing
to
fear
the
stage
goes
under
the
name
of
the
ass
unburdened
the
odd
name
of
the
inn
made
my
mistress
laugh
afresh
everybody
was
asleep
but
the
noise
i
made
and
the
distribution
of
a
few
pauls
procured
me
the
privilege
of
a
fire
i
was
dying
of
hunger
and
they
coolly
told
me
there
was
nothing
to
eat
i
laughed
in
the
landlord
face
and
told
him
to
bring
me
his
butter
his
eggs
his
macaroni
a
ham
and
some
parmesan
cheese
for
i
knew
that
so
much
will
be
found
in
the
inns
all
over
italy
the
repast
was
soon
ready
and
i
shewed
the
idiot
host
that
he
had
materials
for
an
excellent
meal
we
ate
like
four
and
afterwards
they
made
up
an
impromptu
bed
and
we
went
to
sleep
telling
them
to
call
me
as
soon
as
a
carriage
and
four
drew
up
full
of
ham
and
macaroni
slightly
warmed
with
the
chianti
and
montepulciano
and
tired
with
our
journey
we
stood
more
in
need
of
slumber
than
of
love
and
so
we
gave
ourselves
up
to
sleep
till
morning
then
we
gave
a
few
moments
to
pleasure
but
it
was
so
slight
an
affair
as
not
to
be
worth
talking
about
at
one
we
began
to
feel
hungry
again
and
got
up
and
the
host
provided
us
with
an
excellent
dinner
after
receiving
instructions
from
me
i
was
astonished
not
to
see
the
carriage
draw
up
but
i
waited
patiently
all
day
night
came
on
and
still
no
coach
and
i
began
to
feel
anxious
but
the
corticelli
persisted
in
laughing
at
everything
next
morning
i
sent
off
an
express
messenger
with
instructions
for
costa
in
the
event
of
any
violence
having
taken
place
i
was
resolved
to
return
to
florence
of
which
city
i
could
at
any
time
make
myself
free
by
the
expenditure
of
two
hundred
crowns
the
messenger
started
at
noon
and
returned
at
two
with
the
news
that
my
servants
would
shortly
be
with
me
my
coach
was
on
its
way
and
behind
it
a
smaller
carriage
with
two
horses
in
which
sat
an
old
woman
and
a
young
man
that
the
mother
said
corticelli
now
we
shall
have
some
fun
get
something
for
them
to
eat
and
be
ready
to
hear
the
history
of
this
marvellous
adventure
which
she
will
remember
to
her
dying
day
costa
told
me
that
the
auditor
had
revenged
my
contempt
of
his
orders
by
forbidding
the
post
authorities
to
furnish
any
horses
for
my
carriage
hence
the
delay
but
here
we
heard
the
allocution
of
the
signora
laura
i
got
an
excellent
supper
ready
she
began
according
to
your
orders
it
cost
me
more
than
ten
pauls
as
i
shall
shew
you
and
i
hope
you
will
make
it
up
to
me
as
i
but
a
poor
woman
all
was
ready
and
i
joyfully
expected
you
but
in
vain
i
was
in
despair
at
last
when
midnight
came
i
sent
my
son
to
your
lodging
to
enquire
after
you
but
you
may
imagine
my
when
i
heard
that
nobody
knew
what
had
become
of
you
i
passed
a
sleepless
night
weeping
all
the
time
and
in
the
morning
i
went
and
complained
to
the
police
that
you
had
taken
off
my
daughter
and
asked
them
to
send
after
you
and
make
you
give
her
back
to
me
but
only
think
they
laughed
at
me
did
you
let
her
go
out
without
you
laughing
in
my
face
daughter
in
good
hands
says
another
know
perfectly
well
where
she
is
in
fact
i
was
grossly
slandered
slandered
said
the
corticelli
yes
slandered
for
it
was
as
much
as
to
say
that
i
had
consented
to
your
being
carried
off
and
if
i
had
done
that
the
fools
might
have
known
i
would
not
have
come
to
them
about
it
i
went
away
in
a
rage
to
vannini
where
i
found
your
man
who
told
me
that
you
had
gone
to
bologna
and
that
i
could
follow
you
if
i
liked
i
consented
to
this
plan
and
i
hope
you
wilt
pay
my
travelling
expenses
but
i
ca
help
telling
you
that
this
is
rather
beyond
a
joke
i
consoled
her
by
telling
her
i
would
pay
all
she
had
spent
and
we
set
off
for
bologna
the
next
day
and
reached
that
town
at
an
early
hour
i
sent
my
servants
to
the
inn
with
my
carriage
and
i
went
to
lodge
with
the
corticelli
i
spent
a
week
with
the
girl
getting
my
meals
from
the
inn
and
enjoying
a
diversity
of
pleasures
which
i
shall
remember
all
my
days
my
young
wanton
had
a
large
circle
of
female
friends
all
pretty
and
all
kind
i
lived
with
them
like
a
sultan
and
still
i
delight
to
recall
this
happy
time
and
i
say
with
a
sigh
passati
there
are
many
towns
in
italy
where
one
can
enjoy
all
the
pleasures
obtainable
at
bologna
but
nowhere
so
cheaply
so
easily
or
with
so
much
freedom
the
living
is
excellent
and
there
are
arcades
where
one
can
walk
in
the
shade
in
learned
and
witty
company
it
is
a
great
pity
that
either
from
the
air
the
water
or
the
wine
for
men
of
science
have
not
made
up
their
minds
on
the
subject
persons
who
live
at
bologna
are
subject
to
a
slight
itch
the
bolognese
however
far
from
finding
this
unpleasant
seem
to
think
it
an
advantage
it
gives
them
the
pleasure
of
scratching
themselves
in
springtime
the
ladies
distinguish
themselves
by
the
grace
with
which
they
use
their
fingers
towards
i
left
the
corticelli
wishing
her
a
pleasant
journey
for
she
was
going
to
fulfil
a
year
engagement
at
prague
as
second
dancer
i
promised
to
fetch
her
and
her
mother
to
paris
and
my
readers
will
see
how
i
kept
my
word
i
got
to
modena
the
evening
after
i
left
bologna
and
i
stopped
there
with
one
of
those
sudden
whims
to
which
i
have
always
been
subject
next
morning
i
went
out
to
see
the
pictures
and
as
i
was
returning
to
my
lodging
for
dinner
a
fellow
came
up
and
ordered
me
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
continue
my
journey
on
the
day
following
at
latest
very
good
said
i
and
the
fellow
went
away
who
is
that
man
i
said
to
the
landlord
a
spy
a
spy
and
the
government
dares
to
send
such
a
fellow
to
me
the
must
have
sent
him
then
the
is
the
governor
of
modena
the
infamous
wretch
hush
hush
all
the
best
families
speak
to
him
in
the
street
then
the
best
people
are
very
low
here
i
suppose
not
more
than
anywhere
else
he
is
the
manager
of
the
opera
house
and
the
greatest
noblemen
dine
with
him
and
thus
secure
his
favour
it
incredible
but
why
should
the
high
and
mighty
borgello
send
me
away
from
modena
i
do
know
but
do
you
take
my
advice
and
go
and
speak
to
him
you
will
find
him
a
fine
fellow
instead
of
going
to
see
this
i
called
on
the
abbe
testa
grossa
whom
i
had
known
at
venice
in
although
he
was
a
man
of
low
extraction
he
had
a
keen
wit
at
this
time
he
was
old
and
resting
on
his
laurels
he
had
fought
his
way
into
favour
by
the
sheer
force
of
merit
and
his
master
the
duke
of
modena
had
long
chosen
him
as
his
representative
with
other
powers
abbe
testa
grossa
recognized
me
and
gave
me
the
most
gracious
reception
but
when
he
heard
of
what
had
befallen
me
he
seemed
much
annoyed
what
can
i
do
said
i
you
had
better
go
as
the
man
may
put
a
much
more
grievous
insult
on
you
i
will
do
so
but
could
you
oblige
me
by
telling
me
the
reason
for
such
a
action
come
again
this
evening
i
shall
probably
be
able
to
satisfy
you
i
called
on
the
abbe
again
in
the
evening
for
i
felt
anxious
to
learn
in
what
way
i
had
offended
the
lord
borgello
to
whom
i
thought
i
was
quite
unknown
the
abbe
satisfied
me
the
borgello
said
he
saw
your
name
on
the
bill
which
he
receives
daily
containing
a
list
of
the
names
of
those
who
enter
or
leave
the
city
he
remembered
that
you
were
daring
enough
to
escape
from
the
leads
and
as
he
does
not
at
all
approve
of
that
sort
of
thing
he
resolved
not
to
let
the
modenese
be
contaminated
by
so
egregious
an
example
of
the
defiance
of
justice
however
unjust
it
may
be
and
in
short
he
has
given
you
the
order
to
leave
the
town
i
am
much
obliged
but
i
really
wonder
how
it
is
that
while
you
were
telling
me
this
you
did
not
blush
to
be
a
subject
of
the
duke
of
modena
what
an
unworthy
action
how
contrary
is
such
a
system
of
government
to
all
the
best
interests
of
the
state
you
are
quite
right
my
dear
sir
but
i
am
afraid
that
as
yet
men
eyes
are
not
open
to
what
best
serves
their
interests
that
is
doubtless
due
to
the
fact
that
so
many
men
are
unworthy
i
will
not
contradict
you
farewell
abbe
farewell
m
casanova
next
morning
just
as
i
was
going
to
get
into
my
carriage
a
young
man
between
and
thirty
tall
and
strong
and
broad
shouldered
his
eyes
black
and
glittering
his
eyebrows
strongly
arched
and
his
general
air
being
that
of
a
accosted
me
and
begged
me
to
step
aside
and
hear
what
he
had
to
say
if
you
like
to
stop
at
parma
for
three
days
and
if
you
will
promise
to
give
me
fifty
sequins
when
i
bring
you
the
news
that
the
borgello
is
dead
i
promise
to
shoot
him
within
the
next
hours
thanks
such
an
animal
as
that
should
be
allowed
to
die
a
natural
death
here
a
crown
to
drink
my
health
at
the
present
time
i
feel
very
thankful
that
i
acted
as
i
did
but
i
confess
that
if
i
had
felt
sure
that
it
was
not
a
trap
i
should
have
promised
the
money
the
fear
of
committing
myself
spared
me
this
crime
the
next
day
i
got
to
parma
and
i
put
up
at
the
under
the
name
of
the
chevalier
de
seingalt
which
i
still
bear
when
an
honest
man
adopts
a
name
which
belongs
to
no
one
no
one
has
a
right
to
contest
his
use
of
it
it
becomes
a
man
duty
to
keep
the
name
i
had
now
borne
it
for
two
years
but
i
often
subjoined
to
it
my
family
name
when
i
got
to
parma
i
dismissed
costa
but
in
a
week
after
i
had
the
misfortune
to
take
him
on
again
his
father
who
was
a
poor
violin
player
as
i
had
once
been
with
a
large
family
to
provide
for
excited
my
pity
i
made
enquiries
about
antonio
but
he
had
left
the
place
and
dubois
chalelereux
director
of
the
mint
had
gone
to
venice
with
the
permission
of
the
duke
of
parma
to
set
up
the
beam
which
was
never
brought
into
use
republics
are
famous
for
their
superstitious
attachment
to
old
customs
they
are
afraid
that
changes
for
the
better
may
destroy
the
stability
of
the
state
and
the
government
of
aristocratic
venice
still
preserves
its
original
greek
character
my
spaniard
was
delighted
when
i
dismissed
costa
and
proportionately
sorry
when
i
took
him
back
he
no
profligate
said
le
duc
he
is
sober
and
has
no
liking
for
bad
company
but
i
think
he
a
robber
and
a
dangerous
robber
too
i
know
it
because
he
seems
so
scrupulously
careful
not
to
cheat
you
in
small
things
remember
what
i
say
sir
he
will
do
you
he
is
waiting
to
gain
your
confidence
and
then
he
will
strike
home
now
i
am
quite
a
different
sort
of
fellow
a
rogue
in
a
small
way
but
you
know
me
his
insight
was
keener
than
mine
for
five
or
six
months
later
the
italian
robbed
me
of
fifty
thousand
crowns
years
afterwards
in
i
found
him
in
venice
valet
to
count
hardegg
and
i
felt
inclined
to
have
him
hanged
i
shewed
him
by
proof
positive
that
i
could
do
so
if
i
liked
but
he
had
resource
to
tears
and
supplications
and
to
the
intercession
of
a
worthy
man
named
bertrand
who
lived
with
the
ambassador
of
the
king
of
sardinia
i
esteemed
this
individual
and
he
appealed
to
me
successfully
to
pardon
costa
i
asked
the
wretch
what
he
had
done
with
the
gold
and
jewels
he
had
stolen
from
me
and
he
told
me
that
he
had
lost
the
whole
of
it
in
furnishing
funds
for
a
bank
at
biribi
that
he
had
been
despoiled
by
his
own
associates
and
had
been
poor
and
miserable
ever
since
in
the
same
year
in
which
he
robbed
me
he
married
momolo
daughter
and
after
making
her
a
mother
he
abandoned
her
to
pursue
our
story
at
turin
i
lodged
in
a
private
house
with
the
abbe
gama
who
had
been
expecting
me
in
spite
of
the
good
abbe
sermon
on
economy
i
took
the
whole
of
the
first
floor
and
a
fine
suite
it
was
we
discussed
diplomatic
topics
and
he
assured
me
that
i
should
be
accredited
in
may
and
that
he
would
give
me
instructions
as
to
the
part
i
was
to
play
i
was
pleased
with
his
commission
and
i
told
the
abbe
that
i
should
be
ready
to
go
to
augsburg
whenever
the
ambassadors
of
the
belligerent
powers
met
there
after
making
the
necessary
arrangements
with
my
landlady
with
regard
to
my
meals
i
went
to
a
coffeehouse
to
read
the
papers
and
the
first
person
i
saw
was
the
marquis
desarmoises
whom
i
had
known
in
savoy
the
first
thing
he
said
was
that
all
games
of
chance
were
forbidden
and
that
the
ladies
i
had
met
would
no
doubt
be
delighted
to
see
me
as
for
himself
he
said
that
he
lived
by
playing
backgammon
though
he
was
not
at
all
lucky
at
it
as
talent
went
for
more
than
luck
at
that
game
i
can
understand
how
if
fortune
is
neutral
the
best
player
will
win
but
i
do
not
see
how
the
contrary
can
take
place
we
went
for
a
walk
in
the
promenade
leading
to
the
citadel
where
i
saw
numerous
extremely
pretty
women
in
turin
the
fair
sex
is
most
delightful
but
the
police
regulations
are
troublesome
to
a
degree
owing
to
the
town
being
a
small
one
and
thinly
peopled
the
police
spies
find
out
everything
thus
one
can
not
enjoy
any
little
freedoms
without
great
precautions
and
the
aid
of
cunning
procuresses
who
have
to
be
well
paid
as
they
would
be
cruelly
punished
if
they
were
found
out
no
prostitutes
and
no
kept
women
are
allowed
much
to
the
delight
of
the
married
women
and
with
results
which
the
ignorant
police
might
have
anticipated
as
well
be
imagined
pederasty
has
a
fine
field
in
this
town
where
the
passions
are
kept
under
lock
and
key
amongst
the
beauties
i
looked
at
one
only
attracted
me
i
asked
desarmoises
her
name
as
he
knew
all
of
them
that
the
famous
leah
said
he
she
is
a
jewess
and
impregnable
she
has
resisted
the
attacks
of
the
best
strategists
in
turin
her
father
a
famous
you
can
go
and
see
her
easily
enough
but
nothing
to
be
done
there
the
greater
the
difficulty
the
more
i
felt
spurred
on
to
attempt
it
take
me
there
said
i
to
desarmoises
as
soon
as
you
please
i
asked
him
to
dine
with
me
and
we
were
on
our
way
when
we
met
zeroli
and
two
or
three
other
persons
whom
i
had
met
at
aix
i
gave
and
received
plenty
of
compliments
but
not
wishing
to
pay
them
any
visits
i
excused
myself
on
the
pretext
of
business
when
we
had
finished
dinner
desarmoises
took
me
to
the
i
asked
if
he
had
a
good
saddle
horse
he
called
a
lad
and
gave
his
orders
and
whilst
he
was
speaking
the
charming
daughter
appeared
on
the
scene
she
was
dazzlingly
beautiful
and
could
not
be
more
than
her
figure
was
as
lissom
as
a
nymph
her
hair
a
raven
black
her
complexion
a
meeting
of
the
lily
and
the
rose
her
eyes
full
of
fire
her
lashes
long
and
her
so
well
arched
that
they
seemed
ready
to
make
war
on
any
who
would
dare
the
conquest
of
her
charms
all
about
her
betokened
an
educated
mind
and
knowledge
of
the
world
i
was
so
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
her
charms
that
i
did
not
notice
the
horse
when
it
was
brought
to
me
however
i
proceeded
to
scrutinise
it
pretending
to
be
an
expert
and
after
feeling
the
knees
and
legs
turning
back
the
ears
and
looking
at
the
teeth
i
tested
its
behaviour
at
a
walk
a
trot
and
a
gallop
and
then
told
the
jew
that
i
would
come
and
try
it
myself
in
the
next
day
the
horse
was
a
fine
dappled
bay
and
was
priced
at
forty
piedmontese
pistoles
about
a
hundred
sequins
he
is
gentleness
itself
said
leah
and
he
ambles
as
fast
as
any
other
horse
trots
you
have
ridden
it
then
often
sir
and
if
i
were
rich
i
would
never
sell
him
i
wo
buy
the
horse
till
i
have
seen
you
ride
it
she
blushed
at
this
you
must
oblige
the
gentleman
said
her
father
she
consented
to
do
so
and
i
promised
to
come
again
at
nine
the
next
day
i
was
exact
to
time
as
may
be
imagined
and
i
found
leah
in
riding
costume
what
proportions
what
a
venus
callipyge
i
was
captivated
two
horses
were
ready
and
she
leapt
on
hers
with
the
ease
and
grace
of
a
practised
rider
and
i
got
up
on
my
horse
we
rode
together
for
some
distance
the
horse
went
well
enough
but
what
of
that
all
my
eyes
were
for
her
as
we
were
turning
i
said
fair
leah
i
will
buy
the
horse
but
as
a
present
for
you
and
if
you
will
not
take
it
i
shall
leave
turin
today
the
only
condition
i
attach
to
the
gift
is
that
you
will
ride
with
me
whenever
i
ask
you
i
saw
she
seemed
favourably
inclined
to
my
proposal
so
i
told
her
that
i
should
stay
six
weeks
at
turin
that
i
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
on
the
promenade
and
that
the
purchase
of
the
horse
had
been
a
mere
pretext
for
discovering
to
her
my
feelings
she
replied
modestly
that
she
was
vastly
flattered
by
the
liking
i
had
taken
to
her
and
that
i
need
not
have
made
her
such
a
present
to
assure
myself
of
her
friendship
the
condition
you
impose
on
me
is
an
extremely
pleasant
one
and
i
am
sure
that
my
father
will
like
me
to
accept
it
to
this
she
added
all
i
ask
is
for
you
to
make
me
the
present
before
him
repeating
that
you
will
only
buy
it
on
the
condition
that
i
will
accept
it
i
found
the
way
smoother
than
i
had
expected
and
i
did
what
she
asked
me
her
father
whose
name
was
moses
thought
it
a
good
bargain
congratulated
his
daughter
took
the
forty
pistoles
and
gave
me
a
receipt
and
begged
me
to
do
them
the
honour
of
breakfasting
with
them
the
next
day
this
was
just
what
i
wanted
the
following
morning
moses
received
me
with
great
respect
leah
who
was
in
her
ordinary
clothes
told
me
that
if
i
liked
to
ride
she
would
put
on
her
riding
habit
another
day
said
i
i
should
like
to
converse
with
you
in
your
own
house
but
the
father
who
was
as
greedy
as
most
jews
are
said
that
if
i
liked
driving
he
could
sell
me
a
pretty
phaeton
with
two
excellent
horses
you
must
shew
them
to
the
gentleman
said
leah
possibly
in
concert
with
her
father
moses
said
nothing
but
went
out
to
get
the
horses
harnessed
i
will
look
at
them
i
said
to
leah
but
i
wo
buy
as
i
should
not
know
what
to
do
with
them
you
can
take
your
out
for
a
drive
that
would
be
you
but
perhaps
you
would
be
afraid
not
at
all
if
you
drove
in
the
country
or
the
suburbs
very
good
leah
then
i
will
look
at
them
the
father
came
in
and
we
went
downstairs
i
liked
the
carriage
and
the
horses
and
i
told
leah
so
well
said
moses
you
can
have
them
now
for
four
hundred
sequins
but
after
easter
the
price
will
be
five
hundred
sequins
at
least
leah
got
into
the
carriage
and
i
sat
beside
her
and
we
went
for
an
hour
drive
into
the
country
i
told
moses
i
would
give
him
an
answer
by
the
next
day
and
he
went
about
his
business
while
leah
and
i
went
upstairs
again
it
quite
worth
four
hundred
sequins
said
i
and
i
will
buy
it
with
pleasure
but
on
the
same
condition
as
that
on
which
i
bought
the
horse
and
something
more
namely
that
you
will
grant
me
all
the
favours
that
a
tender
lover
can
desire
you
speak
plainly
and
i
will
answer
you
in
the
same
way
i
an
honest
girl
sir
and
not
for
sale
all
women
dear
leah
whether
they
are
honest
or
not
are
for
sale
when
a
man
has
plenty
of
time
he
buys
the
woman
his
heart
desires
by
unremitting
attentions
but
when
he
in
a
hurry
he
buys
her
with
presents
and
even
with
money
then
he
a
clumsy
fellow
he
would
do
better
to
let
sentiment
and
attention
plead
his
cause
and
gain
the
victory
i
wish
i
could
give
myself
that
happiness
fair
leah
but
i
in
a
great
hurry
as
i
finished
this
sentence
her
father
came
in
and
i
left
the
house
telling
him
that
if
i
could
not
come
the
next
day
i
would
come
the
day
after
and
that
we
could
talk
about
the
phaeton
then
it
was
plain
that
leah
thought
i
was
lavish
of
my
money
and
would
make
a
capital
dupe
she
would
relish
the
phaeton
as
she
had
relished
the
horse
but
i
knew
that
i
was
not
quite
such
a
fool
as
that
it
had
not
cost
me
much
trouble
to
resolve
to
chance
the
loss
of
a
hundred
sequins
but
beyond
that
i
wanted
some
value
for
my
money
i
temporarily
suspended
my
visits
to
see
how
leah
and
her
father
would
settle
it
amongst
themselves
i
reckoned
on
the
jew
greediness
to
work
well
for
me
he
was
very
fond
of
money
and
must
have
been
angry
that
his
daughter
had
not
made
me
buy
the
phaeton
by
some
means
or
another
for
so
long
as
the
phaeton
was
bought
the
rest
would
be
perfectly
indifferent
to
him
i
felt
almost
certain
that
they
would
come
and
see
me
the
following
saturday
i
saw
the
fair
jewess
on
the
promenade
we
were
near
enough
for
me
to
accost
her
without
seeming
to
be
anxious
to
do
so
and
her
look
seemed
to
say
come
we
see
no
more
of
you
now
said
she
but
come
and
breakfast
with
me
or
i
will
send
you
back
the
horse
i
promised
to
be
with
her
in
good
time
and
as
the
reader
will
imagine
i
kept
my
word
the
breakfast
party
was
almost
confined
to
ourselves
for
though
her
aunt
was
present
she
was
only
there
for
decency
sake
after
breakfast
we
resolved
to
have
a
ride
and
she
changed
her
clothes
before
me
but
also
before
her
aunt
she
first
put
on
her
leather
breeches
then
let
her
skirts
fall
took
off
her
corset
and
donned
a
jacket
with
seeming
indifference
i
succeeded
in
catching
a
glimpse
of
a
magnificent
breast
but
the
sly
puss
knew
how
much
my
indifference
was
worth
will
you
arrange
my
frill
said
she
this
was
a
warm
occupation
for
me
and
i
am
afraid
my
hand
was
indiscreet
nevertheless
i
thought
i
detected
a
fixed
design
under
all
this
seeming
complaisance
and
i
was
on
my
guard
her
father
came
up
just
as
we
were
getting
on
horseback
if
you
will
buy
the
phaeton
and
horses
said
he
i
will
abate
twenty
sequins
all
that
depends
on
your
daughter
said
i
we
set
off
at
a
walk
and
leah
told
me
that
she
had
been
imprudent
enough
to
confess
to
her
father
that
she
could
make
me
buy
the
carriage
and
that
if
i
did
not
wish
to
embroil
her
with
him
i
would
be
kind
enough
to
purchase
it
strike
the
bargain
said
she
and
you
can
give
it
me
when
you
are
sure
of
my
love
my
dear
leah
i
am
your
humble
servant
but
you
know
on
what
condition
i
promise
to
drive
out
with
you
whenever
you
please
without
getting
out
of
the
carriage
but
i
know
you
would
not
care
for
that
no
your
affection
was
only
a
temporary
caprice
to
convince
you
of
the
contrary
i
will
buy
the
phaeton
and
put
it
in
a
i
will
see
that
the
horses
are
of
though
i
shall
not
use
them
but
if
you
do
not
make
me
happy
in
the
course
of
a
week
i
shall
the
whole
come
to
us
i
will
do
so
but
i
trust
have
some
pledge
of
your
affection
this
morning
this
morning
it
impossible
excuse
me
i
will
go
upstairs
with
you
and
you
can
shew
me
more
than
one
kindness
while
you
are
undressing
we
came
back
and
i
was
astonished
to
hear
her
telling
her
father
that
the
phaeton
was
mine
and
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
put
in
the
horses
the
jew
grinned
and
we
all
went
upstairs
and
leah
coolly
said
count
out
the
money
i
have
not
any
money
about
me
but
i
will
write
you
a
cheque
if
you
like
here
is
paper
i
wrote
a
cheque
on
zappata
for
three
hundred
sequins
payable
at
sight
the
jew
went
off
to
get
the
money
and
leah
remained
alone
with
me
you
have
trusted
me
she
said
and
have
thus
shewn
yourself
worthy
of
my
love
then
undress
quick
no
my
aunt
is
about
the
house
and
as
i
can
not
shut
the
door
without
exciting
suspicion
she
might
come
in
but
i
promise
that
you
shall
be
content
with
me
tomorrow
nevertheless
i
am
going
to
undress
but
you
must
go
in
this
closet
you
may
come
back
when
i
have
got
my
clothes
on
again
i
agreed
to
this
arrangement
and
she
shut
me
in
i
examined
the
door
and
discovered
a
small
chink
between
the
boards
i
got
on
a
stool
and
saw
leah
sitting
on
a
sofa
opposite
to
me
engaged
in
undressing
herself
she
took
off
her
shift
and
wiped
her
breasts
and
her
feet
with
a
towel
and
just
as
she
had
taken
off
her
breeches
and
was
as
naked
as
my
hand
one
of
her
rings
happened
to
slip
off
her
finger
and
rolled
under
the
sofa
she
got
up
looked
to
right
and
left
and
then
stooped
to
search
under
the
sofa
and
to
do
this
she
had
to
kneel
with
her
head
down
when
she
got
back
to
couch
the
towel
came
again
into
requisition
and
she
wiped
herself
all
over
in
such
a
manner
that
all
her
charms
were
revealed
to
my
eager
eyes
i
felt
sure
that
she
knew
i
was
a
witness
of
all
these
operations
and
she
probably
guessed
what
a
fire
the
sight
would
kindle
in
my
inflammable
breast
at
last
her
toilette
was
finished
and
she
let
me
out
i
clasped
her
in
my
arms
with
the
words
i
have
seen
everything
she
pretended
not
to
believe
me
so
i
chewed
her
the
chink
and
was
going
to
obtain
my
just
dues
when
the
accursed
moses
came
in
he
must
have
been
blind
or
he
would
have
seen
the
state
his
daughter
had
put
me
in
however
he
thanked
me
and
gave
me
a
receipt
for
the
money
saying
everything
in
my
poor
house
is
at
your
service
i
bade
them
adieu
and
i
went
away
in
an
ill
temper
i
got
into
my
phaeton
and
drove
home
and
told
the
coachman
to
find
me
a
stable
for
the
horses
and
a
for
the
carriage
i
did
not
expect
to
see
leah
again
and
i
felt
enraged
with
her
she
had
pleased
me
only
too
much
by
her
voluptuous
attitudes
but
she
had
set
up
an
irritation
wholly
hostile
to
love
she
had
made
love
a
robber
and
the
hungry
boy
had
consented
but
afterwards
when
he
craved
more
substantial
fare
she
refused
him
and
ardour
was
succeeded
by
contempt
leah
did
not
want
to
confess
herself
to
be
what
she
really
was
and
my
love
would
not
declare
itself
knavish
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
an
amiable
chevalier
a
soldier
a
man
of
letters
and
a
great
lover
of
horses
who
introduced
me
to
several
pleasant
families
however
i
did
not
cultivate
them
as
they
only
offered
me
the
pleasures
of
sentiment
while
i
longed
for
lustier
fare
for
which
i
was
willing
to
pay
heavily
the
chevalier
de
breze
was
not
the
man
for
me
he
was
too
respectable
for
a
profligate
like
myself
he
bought
the
phaeton
and
horses
and
i
only
lost
thirty
sequins
by
the
transaction
a
certain
baretti
who
had
known
me
at
aix
and
had
been
the
marquis
de
pries
croupier
took
me
to
see
the
mazzoli
formerly
a
dancer
and
then
mistress
to
the
chevalier
raiberti
a
hardheaded
but
honest
man
who
was
then
secretary
for
foreign
affairs
although
the
mazzoli
was
by
no
means
pretty
she
was
extremely
complaisant
and
had
several
girls
at
her
house
for
me
to
see
but
i
did
not
think
any
of
them
worthy
of
occupying
leah
place
i
fancied
i
no
longer
loved
leah
but
i
was
wrong
the
chevalier
cocona
who
had
the
misfortune
to
be
suffering
from
a
venereal
disease
gave
me
up
his
mistress
a
pretty
little
but
in
spite
of
the
evidence
of
my
own
eyes
and
in
spite
of
the
assurances
she
gave
me
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
have
her
and
my
fear
made
me
leave
her
untouched
count
trana
a
brother
of
the
chevalier
whom
i
had
known
at
aix
introduced
me
to
madame
de
sc
a
lady
of
high
rank
and
very
but
she
tried
to
involve
me
in
a
criminal
transaction
and
i
ceased
to
call
on
her
shortly
after
count
trana
uncle
died
and
he
became
rich
and
got
married
but
he
lived
an
unhappy
life
i
was
getting
bored
and
desarmoises
who
had
all
his
meals
with
me
did
not
know
what
to
do
at
last
he
advised
me
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
a
certain
madame
r
a
frenchwoman
and
well
known
in
turin
as
a
milliner
and
dressmaker
she
had
six
or
eight
girls
working
for
her
in
a
room
adjoining
her
shop
desarmoises
thought
that
if
i
got
in
there
i
might
possibly
be
able
to
find
one
to
my
taste
as
my
purse
was
well
furnished
i
thought
i
should
not
have
much
difficulty
so
i
called
on
madame
r
i
was
agreeably
surprised
to
find
leah
there
bargaining
for
a
quantity
of
articles
all
of
which
she
pronounced
to
be
too
dear
she
told
me
kindly
but
reproachfully
that
she
had
thought
i
must
be
i
have
been
very
busy
i
said
and
felt
all
my
old
ardour
revive
she
asked
me
to
come
to
a
jewish
wedding
where
there
would
be
a
good
many
people
and
several
pretty
girls
i
knew
that
ceremonies
of
this
kind
are
very
amusing
and
i
promised
to
be
present
she
proceeded
with
her
bargaining
but
the
price
was
still
too
high
and
she
left
the
shop
madame
r
was
going
to
put
back
all
the
trifles
in
their
places
but
i
said
i
will
take
the
lot
myself
she
smiled
and
i
drew
out
my
purse
and
paid
the
money
where
do
you
live
sir
said
she
and
when
shall
i
send
you
your
purchases
you
may
bring
them
yourself
and
do
me
the
honour
of
breakfasting
with
me
i
can
never
leave
the
shop
sir
in
spite
of
her
years
madame
r
was
still
what
would
be
called
a
tasty
morsel
and
she
had
taken
my
fancy
i
want
some
dark
lace
said
i
then
kindly
follow
me
sir
i
was
delighted
when
i
entered
the
room
to
see
a
lot
of
young
all
charming
hard
at
work
and
scarcely
daring
to
look
at
me
madame
r
opened
several
cupboards
and
showed
me
some
magnificent
lace
i
was
distracted
by
the
sight
of
so
many
delicious
nymphs
and
i
told
her
that
i
wanted
the
lace
for
two
in
the
venetian
style
she
knew
what
i
meant
the
lace
cost
me
upwards
of
a
hundred
sequins
madame
r
told
two
of
her
girls
to
bring
me
the
lace
the
next
day
together
with
the
goods
which
leah
had
thought
too
dear
they
meekly
replied
yes
mother
they
rose
and
kissed
the
mother
hand
which
i
thought
a
ridiculous
ceremony
however
it
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
examining
them
and
i
thought
them
delicious
we
went
back
to
the
shop
and
sitting
down
by
the
counter
i
enlarged
on
the
beauty
of
the
girls
adding
though
not
with
strict
truth
that
i
vastly
preferred
their
mistress
she
thanked
me
for
the
compliment
and
told
me
plainly
that
she
had
a
lover
and
soon
after
named
him
he
was
the
comte
de
giles
an
infirm
and
elderly
man
and
by
no
means
a
model
lover
i
thought
madame
r
was
jesting
but
next
day
i
ascertained
that
she
was
speaking
the
truth
well
everyone
to
his
taste
and
i
suspect
that
she
was
more
in
love
with
the
count
purse
than
his
person
i
had
met
him
at
the
exchange
coffeehouse
the
next
day
the
two
pretty
milliners
brought
me
my
goods
i
offered
them
chocolate
but
they
firmly
and
persistently
declined
the
fancy
took
me
to
send
them
to
leah
with
all
the
things
she
had
chosen
and
i
bade
them
return
and
tell
me
what
sort
of
a
reception
they
had
had
they
said
they
would
do
so
and
waited
for
me
to
write
her
a
note
i
could
not
give
them
the
slightest
mark
of
affection
i
dared
not
shut
the
door
and
the
mistress
and
the
ugly
young
woman
of
the
house
kept
going
and
coming
all
the
time
but
when
they
came
back
i
waited
for
them
on
the
stairs
and
giving
them
a
sequin
each
told
each
of
them
that
she
might
command
my
heart
if
she
would
leah
had
accepted
my
handsome
present
and
sent
to
say
that
she
was
waiting
for
me
as
i
was
walking
aimlessly
about
in
the
afternoon
i
happened
to
pass
the
milliner
shop
and
madame
r
saw
me
and
made
me
come
in
and
sit
down
beside
her
i
am
really
much
obliged
to
you
said
she
for
your
kindness
to
my
girls
they
came
home
enchanted
tell
me
frankly
whether
you
are
really
in
love
with
the
pretty
jewess
i
am
really
in
love
with
her
but
as
she
will
not
make
me
happy
i
have
signed
my
own
dismissal
you
were
quite
right
all
leah
thinks
of
is
duping
those
who
are
captivated
by
her
charms
do
not
your
charming
apprentices
follow
your
maxims
no
but
they
are
only
complaisant
when
i
give
them
leave
then
i
commend
myself
to
your
intercession
for
they
would
not
even
take
a
cup
of
chocolate
from
me
they
were
perfectly
right
not
to
accept
your
chocolate
but
i
see
you
do
not
know
the
ways
of
turin
do
you
find
yourself
comfortable
in
your
present
lodging
quite
so
are
you
perfectly
free
to
do
what
you
like
i
think
so
can
you
give
supper
to
anyone
you
like
in
your
own
rooms
i
am
certain
you
ca
i
have
not
had
the
opportunity
of
trying
the
experiment
so
far
but
i
believe
do
flatter
yourself
by
believing
anything
that
house
is
full
of
the
spies
of
the
police
then
you
think
that
i
could
not
give
you
and
two
or
three
of
your
girls
a
little
supper
i
should
take
very
good
care
not
to
go
to
it
that
all
i
know
by
next
morning
it
would
be
known
to
all
the
town
and
especially
to
the
police
well
supposing
i
look
out
for
another
lodging
it
the
same
everywhere
turin
is
a
perfect
nest
of
spies
but
i
do
know
a
house
where
you
could
live
at
ease
and
where
my
girls
might
perhaps
be
able
to
bring
you
your
purchases
but
we
should
have
to
be
very
careful
where
is
the
house
i
will
be
guided
by
you
in
everything
do
trust
a
piedmontese
that
the
first
commandment
here
she
then
gave
me
the
address
of
a
small
furnished
house
which
was
only
inhabited
by
an
old
and
his
wife
they
will
let
it
you
by
the
month
said
she
and
if
you
pay
a
month
in
advance
you
need
not
even
tell
them
your
name
i
found
the
house
to
be
a
very
pretty
one
standing
in
a
lonely
street
at
about
two
hundred
paces
from
the
citadel
one
gate
large
enough
to
admit
a
carriage
led
into
the
country
i
found
everything
to
be
as
madame
r
had
described
it
i
paid
a
month
in
advance
without
any
bargaining
and
in
a
day
i
had
settled
in
my
new
lodging
madame
r
admired
my
celerity
i
went
to
the
jewish
wedding
and
enjoyed
myself
for
there
is
something
at
once
solemn
and
ridiculous
about
the
ceremony
but
i
resisted
all
leah
endeavours
to
get
me
once
more
into
her
i
hired
a
close
carriage
from
her
father
which
with
the
horses
i
placed
in
the
and
stables
of
my
new
house
thus
i
was
absolutely
free
to
go
whenever
i
would
by
night
or
by
day
for
i
was
at
once
in
the
town
and
in
the
country
i
was
obliged
to
tell
the
inquisitive
gama
where
i
was
living
and
i
hid
nothing
from
desarmoises
whose
needs
made
him
altogether
dependent
on
me
nevertheless
i
gave
orders
that
my
door
was
shut
to
them
as
to
everyone
else
unless
i
had
given
special
instructions
that
they
were
to
be
admitted
i
had
no
reason
to
doubt
the
fidelity
of
my
two
servants
in
this
blissful
abode
i
enjoyed
all
mdlle
r
girls
one
after
the
other
the
one
i
wanted
always
brought
a
companion
whom
i
usually
sent
back
after
giving
her
a
slice
of
the
cake
the
last
of
them
whose
name
was
victorine
as
fair
as
day
and
as
soft
as
a
dove
had
the
misfortune
to
be
tied
though
she
knew
nothing
about
it
mdlle
r
who
was
equally
ignorant
on
the
subject
had
represented
her
to
me
as
a
virgin
and
so
i
thought
her
for
two
long
hours
in
which
i
strove
with
might
and
main
to
break
the
charm
or
rather
open
the
shell
all
my
efforts
were
in
vain
i
was
exhausted
at
last
and
i
wanted
to
see
in
what
the
obstacle
consisted
i
put
her
in
the
proper
position
and
armed
with
a
candle
i
began
my
scrutiny
i
found
a
fleshy
membrane
pierced
by
so
small
a
hole
that
large
pin
head
could
scarcely
have
gone
through
victorine
encouraged
me
to
force
a
passage
with
my
little
finger
but
in
vain
i
tried
to
pierce
this
wall
which
nature
had
made
impassable
by
all
ordinary
means
i
was
tempted
to
see
what
i
could
do
with
a
bistoury
and
the
girl
wanted
me
to
try
but
i
was
afraid
of
the
haemorrhage
which
might
have
been
dangerous
and
i
wisely
refrained
poor
victorine
condemned
to
die
a
maid
unless
some
clever
surgeon
performed
the
same
operation
that
was
undergone
by
mdlle
cheruffini
shortly
after
lepri
married
her
wept
when
i
said
my
dear
child
your
little
hymen
defies
the
most
vigorous
lover
to
enter
his
temple
but
i
consoled
her
by
saying
that
a
good
surgeon
could
easily
make
a
perfect
woman
of
her
in
the
morning
i
told
madame
r
of
the
case
she
laughed
and
said
it
may
prove
a
happy
accident
for
victorine
it
may
make
her
fortune
a
few
years
after
the
count
of
padua
had
her
operated
on
and
made
her
fortune
when
i
came
back
from
spain
i
found
that
she
was
with
child
so
that
i
could
not
exact
the
due
reward
for
all
the
trouble
i
had
taken
with
her
early
in
the
morning
on
maunday
thursday
they
told
me
that
moses
and
leah
wanted
to
see
me
i
had
not
expected
to
see
them
but
i
welcomed
them
warmly
throughout
holy
week
the
jews
dared
not
shew
themselves
in
the
streets
of
turin
and
i
advised
them
to
stay
with
me
till
the
saturday
moses
began
to
try
and
get
me
to
purchase
a
ring
from
him
and
i
judged
from
that
that
i
should
not
have
to
press
them
very
much
i
can
only
buy
this
ring
from
leah
hands
said
i
he
grinned
thinking
doubtless
that
i
intended
to
make
her
a
present
of
it
but
i
was
resolved
to
disappoint
him
i
gave
them
a
magnificent
dinner
and
supper
and
in
the
evening
they
were
shewn
a
room
not
far
from
mine
i
might
have
put
them
in
different
rooms
and
leah
in
a
room
adjoining
mine
which
would
have
facilitated
any
nocturnal
excursions
but
after
all
i
had
done
for
her
i
was
resolved
to
owe
nothing
to
a
surprise
she
should
come
of
herself
the
next
day
moses
who
noticed
that
i
had
not
yet
bought
the
ring
was
obliged
to
go
out
on
business
and
asked
for
the
loan
of
my
carriage
for
the
whole
day
telling
me
that
he
would
come
for
his
daughter
in
the
evening
i
had
the
horses
harnessed
and
when
he
was
gone
i
bought
the
ring
for
six
hundred
sequins
but
on
my
own
terms
i
was
in
my
own
house
and
leah
could
not
deceive
me
as
soon
as
the
father
was
safely
out
of
the
way
i
possessed
myself
of
the
daughter
she
proved
a
docile
and
amorous
subject
the
whole
day
i
had
reduced
her
to
a
state
of
nature
and
though
her
body
was
as
perfect
as
can
well
be
imagined
i
used
it
and
abused
it
in
every
way
imaginable
in
the
evening
her
father
found
her
looking
rather
tired
but
he
seemed
as
pleased
as
i
was
leah
was
not
quite
so
well
satisfied
for
till
the
moment
of
their
departure
she
was
expecting
me
to
give
her
the
ring
but
i
contented
myself
with
saying
that
i
should
like
to
reserve
myself
the
pleasure
of
taking
it
to
her
on
easter
monday
a
man
brought
me
a
note
summoning
me
to
appear
at
the
police
office
chapter
xii
my
victory
over
the
deputy
chief
of
police
my
departure
chamberi
desarmoises
daughter
morin
m
m
at
aix
the
young
boarder
lyons
paris
this
citation
which
did
not
promise
to
lead
to
anything
agreeable
surprised
and
displeased
me
exceedingly
however
i
could
not
avoid
it
so
i
drove
to
the
office
of
the
of
police
i
found
him
sitting
at
a
long
table
surrounded
by
about
a
score
of
people
in
a
standing
posture
he
was
a
man
of
sixty
hideously
ugly
his
enormous
nose
half
destroyed
by
an
ulcer
hidden
by
a
large
black
silk
plaster
his
mouth
of
huge
dimensions
his
lips
thick
with
small
green
eyes
and
eyebrows
which
had
partly
turned
white
as
soon
as
this
disgusting
fellow
saw
me
he
began
you
are
the
chevalier
de
seingalt
that
is
my
name
and
i
have
come
here
to
ask
how
i
can
oblige
you
i
have
summoned
you
here
to
order
you
to
leave
the
place
in
three
days
at
latest
and
as
you
have
no
right
to
give
such
an
order
i
have
come
here
to
tell
you
that
i
shall
go
when
i
please
and
not
before
i
will
expel
you
by
force
you
may
do
that
whenever
you
please
i
can
not
resist
force
but
i
trust
you
will
give
the
matter
a
second
thought
for
in
a
city
they
do
not
expel
a
man
who
has
committed
no
crimes
and
has
a
balance
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
at
the
bank
very
good
but
in
three
days
you
have
plenty
of
time
to
pack
up
and
arrange
matters
with
your
banker
i
advise
you
to
obey
as
the
command
comes
from
the
king
if
i
were
to
leave
the
town
i
should
become
accessory
to
your
injustice
i
will
not
obey
but
since
you
mention
the
king
name
i
will
go
to
his
majesty
at
once
and
he
will
deny
your
words
or
revoke
the
unjust
order
you
have
given
me
with
such
publicity
pray
does
not
the
king
possess
the
power
to
make
you
go
yes
by
force
but
not
by
justice
he
has
also
the
power
to
kill
me
but
he
would
have
to
provide
the
executioner
as
he
could
not
make
me
commit
suicide
you
argue
well
but
nevertheless
you
will
obey
i
argue
well
but
i
did
not
learn
the
art
from
you
and
i
will
not
obey
with
these
words
i
turned
my
back
on
him
and
left
without
another
word
i
was
in
a
furious
rage
i
felt
inclined
to
offer
overt
resistance
to
all
the
myrmidons
of
the
infamous
superintendent
nevertheless
i
soon
calmed
myself
and
summoning
prudence
to
my
aid
i
remembered
the
chevalier
raiberti
whom
i
had
seen
at
his
mistress
house
and
i
decided
on
asking
his
advice
he
was
the
chief
permanent
official
in
the
department
of
foreign
affairs
i
told
the
coachman
to
drive
to
his
house
and
i
recounted
to
him
the
whole
tale
saying
finally
that
i
should
like
to
speak
to
the
king
as
i
was
resolved
that
i
would
not
go
unless
i
was
forced
to
do
so
the
worthy
man
advised
me
to
go
to
the
chevalier
osorio
the
principal
secretary
for
foreign
affairs
who
could
always
get
an
audience
of
the
king
i
was
pleased
with
his
advice
and
i
went
immediately
to
the
minister
who
was
a
sicilian
and
a
man
of
parts
he
gave
me
a
very
good
reception
and
after
i
had
informed
him
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case
i
begged
him
to
communicate
the
matter
to
his
majesty
adding
that
as
the
superintendent
order
appeared
horribly
unjust
to
me
i
was
resolved
not
to
obey
it
unless
compelled
to
do
so
by
main
force
he
promised
to
oblige
me
in
the
way
i
wished
and
told
me
to
call
again
the
next
day
after
leaving
him
i
took
a
short
walk
to
cool
myself
and
then
went
to
the
abbe
gama
hoping
to
be
the
first
to
impart
my
ridiculous
adventure
to
him
i
was
disappointed
he
already
knew
that
i
had
been
ordered
to
go
and
how
i
had
answered
the
superintendent
when
he
saw
that
i
persisted
in
my
determination
to
resist
he
did
not
condemn
my
firmness
though
he
must
have
thought
it
very
extraordinary
for
the
good
abbe
could
not
understand
anybody
disobeying
the
order
of
the
authorities
he
assured
me
that
if
i
had
to
go
he
would
send
me
the
necessary
instructions
to
any
address
i
liked
to
name
the
next
day
the
chevalier
osorio
received
me
with
the
utmost
politeness
which
i
thought
a
good
omen
the
chevalier
raiberti
had
spoken
to
him
in
my
behalf
and
he
had
laid
the
matter
before
the
king
and
also
before
the
count
and
the
result
was
that
i
could
stay
as
long
as
i
liked
the
count
was
none
other
than
the
horrible
superintendent
i
was
told
that
i
must
wait
on
him
and
he
would
give
me
leave
to
remain
at
turin
till
my
affairs
were
settled
my
only
business
here
said
i
is
to
spend
my
money
till
i
have
instructions
from
the
court
of
portugal
to
attend
the
congress
of
augsburg
on
behalf
of
his
most
faithful
majesty
then
you
think
that
this
congress
will
take
place
nobody
doubts
it
somebody
believes
it
will
all
end
in
smoke
however
i
am
delighted
to
have
been
of
service
to
you
and
i
shall
be
curious
to
hear
what
sort
of
reception
you
get
from
the
superintendent
i
felt
ill
at
ease
i
went
to
the
police
office
immediately
glad
to
shew
myself
victorious
and
anxious
to
see
how
the
superintendent
would
look
when
i
came
in
however
i
could
not
flatter
myself
that
he
looked
ashamed
of
himself
these
people
have
a
brazen
forehead
and
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
blush
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
began
the
chevalier
osorio
tells
me
that
you
have
business
in
turin
which
will
keep
you
for
some
days
you
may
therefore
stay
but
you
must
tell
me
as
nearly
as
possible
how
long
a
time
you
require
i
can
not
possibly
tell
you
that
why
if
you
do
mind
telling
me
i
am
awaiting
instructions
from
the
court
of
portugal
to
attend
the
congress
to
be
held
at
augsburg
and
before
i
could
tell
you
how
long
i
shall
have
to
stay
i
should
be
compelled
to
ask
his
most
faithful
majesty
if
this
time
is
not
sufficient
for
me
to
do
my
business
i
will
intimate
the
fact
to
you
i
shall
be
much
obliged
by
your
doing
so
this
time
i
made
him
a
bow
which
was
returned
and
on
leaving
the
office
i
returned
to
the
chevalier
osorio
who
said
with
a
smile
that
i
had
caught
the
superintendent
as
i
had
taken
an
indefinite
period
which
left
me
quite
at
my
ease
the
diplomatic
gama
who
firmly
believed
that
the
congress
would
meet
was
delighted
when
i
told
him
that
the
chevalier
osorio
was
incredulous
on
the
subject
he
was
charmed
to
think
his
wit
keener
than
the
minister
it
exalted
him
in
his
own
eyes
i
told
him
that
whatever
the
chevalier
might
say
i
would
go
to
augsburg
and
that
i
would
set
out
in
three
or
four
weeks
madame
congratulated
me
over
and
over
again
for
she
was
enchanted
that
i
had
humiliated
the
superintendent
but
all
the
same
we
thought
we
had
better
give
up
our
little
suppers
as
i
had
had
a
taste
of
all
her
girls
this
was
not
such
a
great
sacrifice
for
me
to
make
i
continued
thus
till
the
middle
of
may
when
i
left
turin
after
receiving
letters
from
the
abbe
gama
to
lord
stormont
who
was
to
represent
england
at
the
approaching
congress
it
was
with
this
nobleman
that
i
was
to
work
in
concert
at
the
congress
before
going
to
germany
i
wanted
to
see
madame
and
i
wrote
to
her
asking
her
to
send
me
a
letter
of
introduction
to
de
rochebaron
who
might
be
useful
to
me
i
also
asked
raiberti
to
give
me
a
letter
for
chamberi
where
i
wanted
to
visit
the
divine
m
m
of
whom
i
still
thought
with
affection
at
her
convent
grating
i
wrote
to
my
friend
valenglard
asking
him
to
remind
madame
morin
that
she
had
promised
to
shew
me
a
likeness
to
somebody
at
chamberi
but
here
i
must
note
down
an
event
worthy
of
being
recorded
which
was
extremely
prejudicial
to
me
five
or
six
days
before
my
departure
desarmoises
came
to
me
looking
very
downcast
and
told
me
that
he
had
been
ordered
to
leave
turin
in
hours
do
you
know
why
i
asked
him
last
night
when
i
was
at
the
count
scarnafis
dared
to
say
that
france
subsidised
the
berne
newspapers
i
told
him
he
lied
at
which
he
rose
and
left
the
place
in
a
rage
giving
me
a
glance
the
meaning
of
which
is
not
doubtful
i
followed
him
to
bring
him
to
reason
or
to
give
him
satisfaction
but
he
would
do
nothing
and
i
suspect
he
went
to
the
police
to
complain
i
shall
have
to
leave
turin
early
morning
you
a
frenchman
and
as
you
can
claim
the
protection
of
your
ambassador
you
will
be
wrong
to
leave
so
suddenly
in
the
first
place
the
ambassador
is
away
and
in
the
second
my
cruel
father
disavows
me
no
i
would
rather
go
and
wait
for
you
at
lyons
all
i
want
is
for
you
to
lend
me
a
hundred
crowns
for
which
i
will
give
you
an
account
it
will
be
an
easy
account
to
keep
said
i
but
a
long
time
before
it
is
settled
possibly
but
if
it
is
in
my
power
i
will
shew
my
gratitude
for
the
kindnesses
you
have
done
me
i
gave
him
a
hundred
crowns
and
wished
him
a
pleasant
journey
telling
him
that
i
should
stop
some
time
at
lyons
i
got
a
letter
of
credit
on
an
augsburg
house
and
three
days
after
i
left
turin
i
was
at
chamberi
there
was
only
one
inn
there
in
those
days
so
i
was
not
much
puzzled
to
choose
where
i
would
go
but
for
all
that
i
found
myself
very
comfortable
as
i
entered
my
room
i
was
struck
by
seeing
an
extremely
pretty
girl
coming
out
of
an
adjacent
room
who
is
that
young
lady
said
i
to
the
chambermaid
who
was
escorting
me
that
the
wife
of
a
young
gentleman
who
has
to
keep
his
bed
to
get
cured
of
a
which
he
received
four
days
ago
on
his
way
from
france
i
could
not
look
at
her
without
feeling
the
sting
of
concupiscence
as
i
was
leaving
my
room
i
saw
the
door
half
open
and
i
stopped
short
and
offered
my
services
as
a
neighbour
she
thanked
me
politely
and
asked
me
in
i
saw
a
handsome
young
man
sitting
up
in
bed
so
i
went
up
to
enquire
how
he
felt
the
doctor
will
not
let
him
talk
said
the
young
lady
on
account
of
a
in
the
chest
he
received
at
half
a
league
from
here
we
hope
he
will
be
all
right
in
a
few
days
and
then
we
can
continue
our
journey
where
are
you
going
madam
to
geneva
just
as
i
was
leaving
a
maid
came
to
ask
me
if
i
would
take
supper
in
my
own
room
or
with
the
lady
i
laughed
at
her
stupidity
and
said
i
would
sup
in
my
own
apartment
adding
that
i
had
not
the
honour
of
the
acquaintance
at
this
the
young
lady
said
it
would
give
her
great
pleasure
if
i
would
sup
with
her
and
the
husband
repeated
this
assurance
in
a
whisper
i
accepted
the
invitation
gratefully
and
i
thought
that
they
were
really
pleased
the
lady
escorted
me
out
as
far
as
the
stairs
and
i
took
the
liberty
of
kissing
her
hand
which
in
france
is
a
declaration
of
tender
though
respectful
affection
at
the
i
found
a
letter
from
valenglard
telling
me
that
madame
morin
would
wait
on
me
at
chamberi
if
i
would
send
her
a
carriage
and
another
from
desarmoises
dated
from
lyons
he
told
me
that
as
he
was
on
his
way
from
chamberi
he
had
encountered
his
daughter
in
company
with
a
rascal
who
had
carried
her
off
he
had
buried
his
sword
in
his
body
and
would
have
killed
them
if
he
had
been
able
to
stop
their
carriage
he
suspected
that
they
had
been
staying
in
chamberi
and
he
begged
me
to
try
and
persuade
his
daughter
to
return
to
lyons
and
he
added
that
if
she
would
not
do
so
i
ought
to
oblige
him
by
sending
her
back
by
force
he
assured
me
that
they
were
not
married
and
he
begged
me
to
answer
his
letter
by
express
for
which
purpose
he
sent
me
his
address
i
guessed
at
once
that
this
daughter
of
his
was
my
fair
neighbour
but
i
did
not
feel
at
all
inclined
to
come
to
the
aid
of
the
father
in
the
way
he
wished
as
soon
as
i
got
back
to
the
inn
i
sent
off
le
duc
in
a
travelling
carriage
to
madame
morin
whom
i
informed
by
letter
that
as
i
was
only
at
chamberi
for
her
sake
i
would
await
her
convenience
this
done
i
abandoned
myself
to
the
delight
i
felt
at
the
romantic
adventure
which
fortune
had
put
in
my
way
i
repeated
mdlle
desarmoises
and
her
ravisher
and
i
did
not
care
to
enquire
whether
i
was
impelled
in
what
i
did
by
virtue
or
vice
but
i
could
not
help
perceiving
that
my
motives
were
of
a
mixed
nature
for
if
i
were
amorous
i
was
also
very
glad
to
be
of
assistance
to
two
young
lovers
and
all
the
more
from
my
knowledge
of
the
father
criminal
passion
on
entering
their
room
i
found
the
invalid
in
the
surgeon
hands
he
pronounced
the
wound
not
to
be
dangerous
in
spite
of
its
depth
suppuration
had
taken
place
without
setting
up
inflammation
in
short
the
young
man
only
wanted
time
and
rest
when
the
doctor
had
gone
i
congratulated
the
patient
on
his
condition
advising
him
to
be
careful
what
he
ate
and
to
keep
silent
i
then
gave
mdlle
desarmoises
her
father
letter
and
i
said
farewell
for
the
present
telling
them
that
i
would
go
to
my
own
room
till
i
felt
sure
that
she
would
come
and
speak
to
me
after
reading
her
father
letter
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
knocked
timidly
at
my
door
and
when
i
let
her
in
she
gave
me
back
the
letter
and
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
doing
nothing
i
shall
be
only
too
happy
however
if
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
ah
i
breathe
again
could
you
imagine
me
pursuing
any
other
line
of
conduct
i
am
much
interested
in
you
and
will
do
all
in
my
power
to
help
you
are
you
married
not
yet
but
we
are
going
to
be
married
when
we
get
to
geneva
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
about
yourself
i
know
that
your
father
is
unhappily
in
love
with
you
and
that
you
avoid
his
attentions
he
has
told
you
that
much
i
am
glad
of
it
a
year
ago
he
came
to
lyons
and
as
soon
as
i
knew
he
was
in
the
town
i
took
refuge
with
a
friend
of
my
mother
for
i
was
aware
that
i
could
not
stay
in
the
same
house
with
my
father
for
an
hour
without
exposing
myself
to
the
most
horrible
outrage
the
young
man
in
bed
is
the
son
of
a
rich
geneva
merchant
my
father
introduced
him
to
me
two
years
ago
and
we
soon
fell
in
love
with
each
other
my
father
went
away
to
marseilles
and
my
lover
asked
my
mother
to
give
me
in
marriage
to
him
but
she
did
not
feel
authorized
to
do
so
without
my
father
consent
she
wrote
and
asked
him
but
he
replied
that
he
would
announce
his
decision
when
he
returned
to
lyons
my
lover
went
to
geneva
and
as
his
father
approved
of
the
match
he
returned
with
all
the
necessary
documents
and
a
strong
letter
of
commendation
from
tolosan
when
my
father
came
to
lyons
i
escaped
as
i
told
you
and
my
lover
got
tolosan
to
ask
my
hand
for
him
of
my
father
his
reply
was
can
give
no
answer
till
she
returns
to
my
house
tolosan
brought
this
reply
to
me
and
i
told
him
that
i
was
ready
to
obey
if
my
mother
would
guarantee
my
safety
she
replied
however
that
she
knew
her
husband
too
well
to
dare
to
have
us
both
under
the
same
roof
again
did
tolosan
endeavour
to
obtain
my
father
consent
but
to
no
purpose
a
few
days
after
he
left
lyons
telling
us
that
he
was
first
going
to
aix
and
then
to
turin
and
as
it
was
evident
that
he
would
never
give
his
consent
my
lover
proposed
that
i
should
go
off
with
him
promising
to
marry
me
as
soon
as
we
reached
geneva
by
ill
luck
we
travelled
through
savoy
and
thus
met
my
father
as
soon
as
he
saw
us
he
stopped
the
carriage
and
called
to
me
to
get
out
i
began
to
shriek
and
my
lover
taking
me
in
his
arms
to
protect
me
my
father
stabbed
him
in
the
chest
no
doubt
he
would
have
killed
him
but
seeing
that
my
shrieks
were
bringing
people
to
our
rescue
and
probably
believing
that
my
lover
was
as
good
as
dead
he
got
on
horseback
again
and
rode
off
at
full
speed
i
can
chew
you
the
sword
still
covered
with
blood
i
am
obliged
to
answer
this
letter
of
his
and
i
am
thinking
how
i
can
obtain
his
consent
that
of
no
consequence
we
can
marry
and
be
happy
without
it
true
but
you
ought
not
to
despise
your
dower
good
heavens
what
dower
he
has
no
money
but
on
the
death
of
his
father
the
marquis
desarmoises
that
all
a
lie
my
father
has
only
a
small
yearly
pension
for
having
served
thirty
years
as
a
government
messenger
his
father
has
been
dead
these
thirty
years
and
my
mother
and
my
sister
only
live
by
the
work
they
do
i
was
thunderstruck
at
the
impudence
of
the
fellow
who
after
imposing
on
me
so
long
had
himself
put
me
in
a
position
to
discover
his
deceit
i
said
nothing
just
then
we
were
told
that
supper
was
ready
and
we
sat
at
table
for
three
hours
talking
the
matter
over
the
poor
wounded
man
had
only
to
listen
to
me
to
know
my
feelings
on
the
subject
his
young
mistress
as
witty
as
she
was
pretty
jested
on
the
foolish
passion
of
her
father
who
had
loved
her
madly
ever
since
she
was
eleven
and
you
were
always
able
to
resist
his
attempts
said
i
yes
whenever
he
pushed
things
too
far
and
how
long
did
this
state
of
things
continue
for
two
years
when
i
was
thirteen
he
thought
i
was
ripe
and
tried
to
gather
the
fruit
but
i
began
to
shriek
and
escaped
from
his
bed
stark
naked
and
i
went
to
take
refuge
with
my
mother
who
from
that
day
forth
would
not
let
me
sleep
with
him
again
you
used
to
sleep
with
him
how
could
your
mother
allow
it
she
never
thought
that
there
was
anything
criminal
in
his
affection
for
me
and
i
knew
nothing
about
it
i
thought
that
what
he
did
to
me
and
what
he
made
me
do
to
him
were
mere
trifles
but
you
have
saved
the
little
treasure
i
have
kept
it
for
my
lover
the
poor
lover
who
was
suffering
more
from
the
effects
of
hunger
than
from
his
wounds
laughed
at
this
speech
of
hers
and
she
ran
to
him
and
covered
his
face
with
kisses
all
this
excited
me
intensely
her
story
had
been
told
with
too
much
simplicity
not
to
move
me
especially
when
i
had
her
before
my
eyes
for
she
possessed
all
the
attractions
which
a
woman
can
have
and
i
almost
forgave
her
father
for
forgetting
she
was
his
daughter
and
falling
in
love
with
her
when
she
escorted
me
back
to
my
room
i
made
her
feel
my
emotion
and
she
began
to
laugh
but
as
my
servants
were
close
by
i
was
obliged
to
let
her
go
early
next
morning
i
wrote
to
her
father
that
his
daughter
had
resolved
not
to
leave
her
lover
who
was
only
slightly
wounded
that
they
were
in
perfect
safety
and
under
the
protection
of
the
law
at
chamberi
and
finally
that
having
heard
their
story
and
judging
them
to
be
well
matched
i
could
only
approve
of
the
course
they
had
taken
when
i
had
finished
i
went
into
their
room
and
gave
them
the
letter
to
read
and
seeing
the
fair
runaway
at
a
loss
how
to
express
her
i
begged
the
invalid
to
let
me
kiss
her
begin
with
me
said
he
opening
his
arms
my
hypocritical
love
masked
itself
under
the
guise
of
paternal
affection
i
embraced
the
lover
and
then
more
amorously
i
performed
the
same
office
for
the
mistress
and
skewed
them
my
purse
full
of
gold
telling
them
it
was
at
their
service
while
this
was
going
on
the
surgeon
came
in
and
i
retired
to
my
room
at
eleven
madame
morin
and
her
daughter
arrived
preceded
by
le
duc
on
horseback
who
announced
their
approach
by
numerous
smacks
of
his
whip
i
welcomed
her
with
open
arms
thanking
her
for
obliging
me
the
first
piece
of
news
she
gave
me
was
that
mdlle
roman
had
become
mistress
to
louis
that
she
lived
in
a
beautiful
house
at
passi
and
that
she
was
five
months
gone
with
child
thus
she
was
in
a
fair
way
to
become
queen
of
france
as
my
divine
oracle
had
predicted
at
grenoble
she
added
you
are
the
sole
topic
of
conversation
and
i
advise
you
not
to
go
there
unless
you
wish
to
settle
in
the
country
for
they
would
never
let
you
go
you
would
have
all
the
nobility
at
your
feet
and
above
all
the
ladies
anxious
to
know
the
lot
of
their
daughters
everybody
believes
in
judicial
astrology
now
and
valenglard
triumphs
he
has
bet
a
hundred
louis
to
fifty
that
my
niece
will
be
delivered
of
a
young
prince
and
he
is
certain
of
winning
though
to
be
sure
if
he
loses
everybody
will
laugh
at
him
do
be
afraid
of
his
losing
is
it
quite
certain
has
not
the
horoscope
proved
truthful
in
the
principal
particular
if
the
other
circumstances
do
not
follow
i
must
have
made
a
great
mistake
in
my
calculations
i
am
delighted
to
hear
you
say
so
i
am
going
to
paris
and
i
hope
you
will
give
me
a
letter
of
introduction
to
madame
varnier
so
that
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
your
niece
you
shall
have
the
letter
without
fail
i
introduced
mdlle
desarmoises
to
her
under
the
family
name
of
her
lover
and
invited
her
to
dine
with
madame
morin
and
myself
after
dinner
we
went
to
the
convent
and
m
m
came
down
very
surprised
at
this
unexpected
visit
from
her
aunt
but
when
she
saw
me
she
had
need
of
all
her
presence
of
mind
when
her
aunt
introduced
me
to
her
by
name
she
observed
with
true
feminine
tact
that
during
her
stay
at
aix
she
had
seen
me
five
or
six
times
at
the
fountain
but
that
i
could
not
remember
her
features
as
she
had
always
worn
her
veil
i
admired
her
wit
as
much
as
her
exquisite
features
i
thought
she
had
grown
prettier
than
ever
and
no
doubt
my
looks
told
her
as
much
we
spent
an
hour
in
talking
about
grenoble
and
her
old
friends
whom
she
gladly
recalled
to
her
memory
and
then
she
went
to
fetch
a
young
girl
who
was
boarding
at
the
convent
whom
she
liked
and
wanted
to
present
to
her
aunt
i
seized
the
opportunity
of
telling
madame
morin
that
i
was
astonished
at
the
likeness
that
her
very
voice
was
like
that
of
my
venetian
m
m
and
i
begged
her
to
obtain
me
the
privilege
of
breakfasting
with
her
niece
the
next
day
and
of
presenting
her
with
a
dozen
pounds
of
capital
chocolate
i
had
brought
it
with
me
from
genoa
you
must
make
her
the
present
yourself
said
madame
morin
for
though
she
a
nun
she
a
woman
and
we
women
much
prefer
a
present
from
a
man
than
from
a
woman
hand
m
m
returned
with
the
superior
of
the
convent
two
other
nuns
and
the
young
boarder
who
came
from
lyons
and
was
exquisitely
beautiful
i
was
obliged
to
talk
to
all
the
nuns
and
madame
morin
told
her
niece
that
i
wanted
her
to
try
some
excellent
chocolate
i
had
brought
from
genoa
but
that
i
hoped
her
would
make
it
sir
said
m
m
kindly
send
me
the
chocolate
and
we
will
breakfast
together
with
these
dear
sisters
as
soon
as
i
got
back
to
my
inn
i
sent
the
chocolate
with
a
respectful
note
and
i
took
supper
in
madame
morin
room
with
her
daughter
and
mdlle
desarmoises
of
whom
i
was
feeling
more
and
more
amorous
but
i
talked
of
m
m
all
the
time
and
i
could
see
that
the
aunt
suspected
that
the
pretty
nun
was
not
altogether
a
stranger
to
me
i
breakfasted
at
the
convent
and
i
remember
that
the
chocolate
the
biscuits
and
the
sweetmeats
were
served
with
a
nicety
which
savoured
somewhat
of
the
world
when
we
had
finished
breakfast
i
told
m
m
that
she
would
not
find
it
so
easy
to
give
me
a
dinner
with
twelve
persons
sitting
down
to
table
but
i
added
that
half
the
company
could
be
in
the
convent
and
half
in
the
parlour
separated
from
the
convent
by
a
light
grating
it
a
sight
i
should
like
to
see
said
i
if
you
will
allow
me
to
pay
all
expenses
certainly
replied
m
m
and
this
dinner
was
fixed
for
the
next
day
m
m
took
charge
of
the
whole
thing
and
promised
to
ask
six
nuns
madame
morin
who
knew
my
tastes
told
her
to
spare
nothing
and
i
warned
her
that
i
would
send
in
the
necessary
wines
i
escorted
madame
morin
her
daughter
and
mdlle
desarmoises
back
to
the
hotel
and
i
then
called
on
magnan
to
whom
i
had
been
recommended
by
the
chevalier
raiberti
i
asked
him
to
get
me
some
of
the
best
wine
and
he
took
me
down
to
his
cellar
and
told
me
to
take
what
i
liked
his
wines
proved
to
be
admirable
this
magnan
was
a
clever
man
of
a
pleasant
appearance
and
very
comfortably
off
he
occupied
an
extremely
large
and
convenient
house
outside
the
town
and
there
his
agreeable
wife
dispensed
hospitality
she
had
ten
children
amongst
whom
there
were
four
pretty
daughters
the
eldest
who
was
nineteen
was
especially
we
went
to
the
convent
at
eleven
and
after
an
conversation
we
were
told
that
dinner
was
ready
the
table
was
beautifully
laid
covered
with
a
fair
white
cloth
and
adorned
with
vases
filled
with
artificial
flowers
so
strongly
scented
that
the
air
of
the
parlour
was
quite
balmy
the
fatal
grill
was
heavier
than
i
had
hoped
i
found
myself
seated
to
the
left
of
m
m
and
totally
unable
to
see
her
the
fair
desarmoises
was
at
my
right
and
she
entertained
us
all
the
time
with
her
amusing
stories
we
in
the
parlour
were
waited
on
by
le
duc
and
costa
and
the
nuns
were
served
by
their
the
abundant
provision
the
excellent
wines
the
pleasant
though
sometimes
equivocal
conversation
kept
us
all
merrily
employed
for
three
hours
mirth
had
the
mastery
over
reason
or
to
speak
more
plainly
we
were
all
drunk
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
fatal
grill
i
could
have
had
the
whole
eleven
ladies
without
much
trouble
the
young
desarmoises
was
so
gay
indeed
that
if
i
had
not
restrained
her
she
would
probably
have
scandalised
all
the
nuns
who
would
have
liked
nothing
better
i
was
longing
to
have
her
to
myself
that
i
might
quench
the
flame
she
had
kindled
in
my
breast
and
i
had
no
doubt
of
my
success
on
the
first
attempt
after
coffee
had
been
served
we
went
into
another
parlour
and
stayed
there
till
night
came
on
madame
morin
took
leave
of
her
niece
and
the
thanks
and
promises
of
remembrance
between
me
and
the
nuns
lasted
for
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
after
i
had
said
aloud
to
m
m
that
i
hoped
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
before
i
left
we
went
back
to
the
inn
in
high
good
humour
with
our
curious
party
which
i
still
remember
with
pleasure
madame
morin
gave
me
a
letter
for
her
cousin
madame
varnier
and
i
promised
to
write
to
her
from
paris
and
tell
her
all
about
the
fair
mdlle
roman
i
presented
the
daughter
with
a
beautiful
pair
of
and
i
gave
madame
morin
twelve
pounds
of
good
chocolate
which
magnan
got
me
and
which
the
lady
thought
had
come
from
genoa
she
went
off
at
eight
preceded
by
le
duc
who
had
orders
to
greet
the
doorkeeper
family
on
my
behalf
at
magnan
i
had
a
dinner
worthy
of
lucullus
and
i
promised
to
stay
with
him
whenever
i
passed
chamberi
which
promise
i
have
faithfully
performed
on
leaving
the
gourmand
i
went
to
the
convent
and
m
m
came
down
alone
to
the
grating
she
thanked
me
for
coming
to
see
her
and
added
that
i
had
come
to
disturb
her
peace
of
mind
i
am
quite
ready
dearest
to
climb
the
harden
wall
and
i
shall
do
it
more
dexterously
than
your
wretched
humpback
alas
that
may
not
be
for
trust
me
you
are
already
spied
upon
everybody
here
is
sure
that
we
knew
each
other
at
aix
let
us
forget
all
and
thus
spare
ourselves
the
torments
of
vain
desires
give
me
your
hand
no
all
is
over
i
love
you
still
probably
i
shall
always
love
you
but
i
long
for
you
to
go
and
by
doing
so
you
will
give
me
a
proof
of
your
love
this
is
dreadful
you
astonish
me
you
appear
to
me
in
perfect
health
you
are
prettier
than
ever
you
are
made
for
the
worship
of
the
sweetest
of
the
gods
and
i
ca
understand
how
with
a
temperament
like
yours
you
can
live
in
continual
abstinence
alas
lacking
the
reality
we
console
ourselves
by
pretending
i
will
not
conceal
from
you
that
i
love
my
young
boarder
it
is
an
innocent
passion
and
keeps
my
mind
calm
her
caresses
quench
the
flame
which
would
otherwise
kill
me
and
that
is
not
against
your
conscience
i
do
not
feel
any
distress
on
the
subject
but
you
know
it
is
a
sin
yes
so
i
confess
it
and
what
does
the
confessor
say
nothing
he
absolves
me
and
i
am
quite
content
and
does
the
pretty
boarder
confess
too
certainly
but
she
does
not
tell
the
father
of
a
matter
which
she
thinks
is
no
sin
i
wonder
the
confessor
has
not
taught
her
for
that
kind
of
instruction
is
a
great
pleasure
our
confessor
is
a
wise
old
man
am
i
to
leave
you
then
without
a
single
kiss
not
one
may
i
come
again
i
must
go
the
day
after
you
may
come
but
i
can
not
see
you
by
myself
as
the
nuns
might
talk
i
will
bring
my
little
one
with
me
to
save
appearances
come
after
dinner
but
into
the
other
parlour
if
i
had
not
known
m
m
at
aix
her
religious
ideas
would
have
astonished
me
but
such
was
her
character
she
loved
god
and
did
not
believe
that
the
kind
father
who
made
us
with
passions
would
be
too
severe
because
we
had
not
the
strength
to
subdue
them
i
returned
to
the
inn
feeling
vexed
that
the
pretty
nun
would
have
no
more
to
do
with
me
but
sure
of
consolation
from
the
fair
desarmoises
i
found
her
sitting
on
her
lover
bed
his
poor
diet
and
the
fever
had
left
him
in
a
state
of
great
weakness
she
told
me
that
she
would
sup
in
my
room
to
leave
him
in
quiet
and
the
worthy
young
man
shook
my
hand
in
token
of
his
gratitude
as
i
had
a
good
dinner
at
magnan
i
ate
very
little
supper
but
my
companion
who
had
only
had
a
light
meal
ate
and
drank
to
an
amazing
extent
i
gazed
at
her
in
a
kind
of
wonder
and
she
enjoyed
my
astonishment
when
my
servants
had
left
the
room
i
challenged
her
to
drink
a
bowl
of
punch
with
me
and
this
put
her
into
a
mood
which
asked
for
nothing
but
laughter
and
which
laughed
to
find
itself
deprived
of
reasoning
power
nevertheless
i
can
not
accuse
myself
of
taking
an
advantage
of
her
condition
for
in
her
voluptuous
excitement
she
entered
eagerly
into
the
pleasure
to
which
i
excited
her
till
two
in
the
morning
by
the
time
we
separated
we
were
both
of
us
exhausted
i
slept
till
eleven
and
when
i
went
to
wish
her
good
day
i
found
her
smiling
and
as
fresh
as
a
rose
i
asked
her
how
she
had
passed
the
rest
of
the
night
very
pleasantly
said
she
like
the
beginning
of
the
night
what
time
would
you
like
to
have
dinner
i
wo
dine
i
prefer
to
keep
my
appetite
for
supper
here
her
lover
joined
in
saying
in
a
weak
voice
it
is
impossible
to
keep
up
with
her
in
eating
or
drinking
i
asked
in
eating
drinking
and
in
other
things
he
replied
with
a
smile
she
laughed
and
kissed
him
affectionately
this
short
dialogue
convinced
me
that
mdlle
desarmoises
must
adore
her
lover
for
besides
his
being
a
handsome
young
man
his
disposition
was
exactly
suitable
to
hers
i
dined
by
myself
and
le
duc
came
in
as
i
was
having
dessert
he
told
me
that
the
daughters
and
their
pretty
cousin
had
made
him
wait
for
them
to
write
to
me
and
he
gave
me
three
letters
and
three
dozen
of
gloves
which
they
had
presented
me
the
letters
urged
me
to
come
and
spend
a
month
with
them
and
gave
me
to
understand
that
i
should
be
well
pleased
with
my
treatment
i
had
not
the
courage
to
return
to
a
town
where
with
my
reputation
i
should
have
been
obliged
to
draw
horoscopes
for
all
the
young
ladies
or
to
make
enemies
by
refusing
after
i
had
read
the
letters
from
grenoble
i
went
to
the
convent
and
announced
my
presence
and
then
entered
the
parlour
which
m
m
had
indicated
she
soon
came
down
with
the
pretty
boarder
who
feebly
sustained
my
part
in
her
amorous
ecstacies
she
had
not
yet
completed
her
twelfth
year
but
she
was
extremely
tall
and
well
developed
for
her
age
gentleness
liveliness
candour
and
wit
were
united
in
her
features
and
gave
her
expression
an
exquisite
charm
she
wore
a
corset
which
disclosed
a
white
throat
to
which
the
fancy
easily
added
the
two
spheres
which
would
soon
appear
there
her
entrancing
face
her
raven
locks
and
her
ivory
throat
indicated
what
might
be
concealed
and
my
vagrant
imagination
made
her
into
a
budding
venus
i
began
by
telling
her
that
she
was
very
pretty
and
would
make
her
future
husband
a
happy
man
i
knew
she
would
blush
at
that
it
may
be
cruel
but
it
is
thus
that
the
language
of
seduction
always
begins
a
girl
of
her
age
who
does
not
blush
at
the
mention
of
marriage
is
either
an
idiot
or
already
an
expert
in
profligacy
in
spite
of
this
however
the
blush
which
mounts
to
a
young
girl
cheek
at
the
approach
of
such
ideas
is
a
puzzling
problem
whence
does
it
arise
it
may
be
from
pure
simplicity
it
may
be
from
shame
and
often
from
a
mixture
of
both
feelings
then
comes
the
fight
between
vice
and
virtue
and
it
is
usually
virtue
which
has
to
give
in
the
desires
the
servants
of
vice
usually
attain
their
ends
as
i
knew
the
young
boarder
from
m
m
description
i
could
not
be
ignorant
of
the
source
of
those
blushes
which
added
a
fresh
attraction
to
her
youthful
charms
pretending
not
to
notice
anything
i
talked
to
m
m
for
a
few
moments
and
then
returned
to
the
assault
she
had
regained
her
calm
what
age
are
you
pretty
one
said
i
i
am
thirteen
you
are
wrong
said
m
m
you
have
not
yet
completed
your
twelfth
year
the
time
will
come
said
i
when
you
will
diminish
the
tale
of
your
years
instead
of
increasing
it
i
shall
never
tell
a
lie
sir
i
am
sure
of
that
so
you
want
to
be
a
nun
do
you
i
have
not
yet
received
my
vocation
but
even
if
i
live
in
the
world
i
need
not
be
a
liar
you
are
wrong
you
will
begin
to
lie
as
soon
as
you
have
a
lover
will
my
lover
tell
lies
too
certainly
he
will
if
the
matter
were
really
so
then
i
should
have
a
bad
opinion
of
love
but
i
do
not
believe
it
for
i
love
my
sweetheart
here
and
i
never
conceal
the
truth
from
her
yes
but
loving
a
man
is
a
different
thing
to
loving
a
woman
no
it
is
it
just
the
same
not
so
for
you
do
not
go
to
bed
with
a
woman
and
you
do
with
your
husband
that
no
matter
my
love
would
be
the
same
what
you
would
not
rather
sleep
with
me
than
with
m
m
no
indeed
i
should
not
because
you
are
a
man
and
would
see
me
you
do
want
a
man
to
see
you
then
no
do
you
think
you
are
so
ugly
then
at
this
she
turned
to
m
m
and
said
with
evident
vexation
i
am
not
really
ugly
am
i
no
darling
said
m
m
bursting
with
laughter
it
is
quite
the
other
way
you
are
very
pretty
with
these
words
she
took
her
on
her
knee
and
embraced
her
tenderly
your
corset
is
too
tight
you
ca
possibly
have
such
a
small
waist
as
that
you
make
a
mistake
you
can
put
your
hand
there
and
see
for
yourself
i
ca
believe
it
m
m
then
held
her
close
to
the
grill
and
told
me
to
see
for
myself
at
the
same
moment
she
turned
up
her
dress
you
were
right
said
i
and
i
owe
you
an
apology
but
in
my
heart
i
cursed
the
grating
and
the
chemise
my
opinion
is
said
i
to
m
m
that
we
have
here
a
little
boy
i
did
not
wait
for
a
reply
but
satisfied
myself
by
my
sense
of
touch
as
to
her
sex
and
i
could
see
that
the
little
one
and
her
governess
were
both
pleased
that
my
mind
was
at
rest
on
the
subject
i
drew
my
hand
away
and
the
little
girl
looked
at
m
m
and
reassured
by
her
smiling
air
asked
if
she
might
go
away
for
a
moment
i
must
have
reduced
her
to
a
state
in
which
a
moment
solitude
was
necessary
and
i
myself
was
in
a
very
excited
condition
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
i
said
to
m
m
do
you
know
that
what
you
have
shewn
me
has
made
me
unhappy
has
it
why
because
your
boarder
is
charming
and
i
am
longing
to
enjoy
her
i
am
sorry
for
that
for
you
ca
possibly
go
any
further
and
besides
i
know
you
and
even
if
you
could
satisfy
your
passion
without
danger
to
her
i
would
not
give
her
up
to
you
you
would
spoil
her
how
do
you
think
that
after
enjoying
you
she
would
care
to
enjoy
me
i
should
lose
too
heavily
by
the
comparison
give
me
your
hand
no
stay
one
moment
i
do
want
to
see
anything
not
a
little
bit
nothing
at
all
are
you
angry
with
me
then
not
at
all
if
you
have
been
pleased
i
am
glad
and
if
you
have
filled
her
with
desires
she
will
love
me
all
the
better
how
pleasant
it
would
be
sweetheart
if
we
could
all
three
of
us
be
together
alone
and
at
liberty
yes
but
it
is
impossible
are
you
sure
that
no
inquisitive
eye
is
looking
upon
us
quite
sure
the
height
of
that
fatal
grill
has
deprived
me
of
the
sight
of
many
charms
why
did
you
go
to
the
other
parlour
it
is
much
lower
there
let
us
go
there
then
not
i
should
not
be
able
to
give
any
reason
for
the
change
i
will
come
again
and
start
for
lyons
in
the
evening
the
little
boarder
came
back
and
i
stood
up
facing
her
i
had
a
number
of
beautiful
seals
and
trinkets
hanging
from
my
and
i
had
not
had
the
time
to
put
myself
in
a
state
of
perfect
decency
again
she
noticed
it
and
by
way
of
pretext
she
asked
if
she
might
look
at
them
as
long
as
you
like
you
may
look
at
them
and
touch
them
as
well
m
m
foresaw
what
would
happen
and
left
the
room
saying
that
she
would
soon
be
back
i
had
intended
to
deprive
the
young
boarder
of
all
interest
in
my
seals
by
shewing
her
a
curiosity
of
another
kind
she
did
not
conceal
her
pleasure
in
satisfying
her
inquisitiveness
on
an
object
which
was
quite
new
to
her
and
which
she
was
able
to
examine
minutely
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
but
soon
an
effusion
changed
her
curiosity
into
surprise
and
i
did
not
interrupt
her
in
her
delighted
gaze
i
saw
m
m
coming
back
slowly
and
i
lowered
my
shirt
again
and
sat
down
my
watch
and
chains
were
still
on
the
ledge
of
the
grating
and
m
m
asked
her
young
friend
if
the
trinkets
had
pleased
her
yes
she
replied
but
in
a
dreamy
and
melancholy
voice
she
had
learnt
so
much
in
the
course
of
less
than
two
hours
that
she
had
plenty
to
think
over
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
telling
m
m
the
adventures
i
had
encountered
since
i
had
left
her
but
as
i
had
not
time
to
finish
my
tale
i
promised
to
return
the
next
day
at
the
same
time
the
little
girl
who
had
been
listening
to
me
all
the
time
though
i
appeared
to
be
only
addressing
her
friend
said
that
she
longed
to
know
the
end
of
my
adventure
with
the
duke
of
matelone
mistress
i
supped
with
the
fair
desarmoises
and
after
giving
her
sundry
proofs
of
my
affection
till
midnight
and
telling
her
that
i
only
stopped
on
for
her
sake
i
went
to
bed
the
next
day
after
dinner
i
returned
to
the
convent
and
having
sent
up
my
name
to
m
m
i
entered
the
room
where
the
grating
was
more
convenient
before
long
m
m
arrived
alone
but
she
anticipated
my
thoughts
by
telling
me
that
her
pretty
friend
would
soon
join
her
you
have
fired
her
imagination
she
has
told
me
all
about
it
playing
a
thousand
wanton
tricks
and
calling
me
her
dear
husband
you
have
seduced
the
girl
and
i
am
very
glad
you
are
going
or
else
you
would
drive
her
mad
you
will
see
how
she
has
dressed
herself
are
you
sure
of
her
discretion
perfectly
but
i
hope
you
wo
do
anything
in
my
presence
when
i
see
the
time
coming
i
will
leave
the
room
you
are
an
angel
dearest
but
you
might
be
something
better
than
that
if
you
would
i
want
nothing
for
myself
it
is
out
of
the
question
you
could
no
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
a
pastime
which
would
rekindle
fires
that
are
hardly
yet
quenched
i
have
spoken
i
suffer
but
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
at
this
moment
the
young
adept
came
in
smiling
with
her
eyes
full
of
fire
she
was
dressed
in
a
short
pelisse
open
in
front
and
an
embroidered
muslin
skirt
which
did
not
go
beyond
her
knees
she
looked
like
a
sylph
we
had
scarcely
sat
down
when
she
reminded
me
of
the
place
where
my
tale
had
stopped
i
continued
my
recital
and
when
i
was
telling
them
how
donna
lucrezia
shewed
me
leonilda
naked
m
m
went
out
and
the
sly
little
puss
asked
me
how
i
assured
myself
that
my
daughter
was
a
maid
i
took
bold
of
her
through
the
fatal
grating
against
which
she
placed
her
pretty
body
and
shewed
her
how
assured
myself
of
the
fact
and
the
girl
liked
it
so
much
that
she
pressed
my
hand
to
the
spot
she
then
gave
me
her
hand
that
i
might
share
her
pleasure
and
whilst
this
enjoyable
occupation
was
in
progress
m
m
appeared
my
sweetheart
said
hastily
never
mind
i
told
her
all
about
it
she
is
a
good
creature
and
will
not
be
vexed
accordingly
m
m
pretended
not
to
see
anything
and
the
precocious
little
girl
wiped
her
hand
in
a
kind
of
voluptuous
ecstacy
which
shewed
how
well
she
was
pleased
i
proceeded
with
my
history
but
when
i
came
to
the
episode
of
the
poor
girl
who
was
describing
all
the
trouble
i
had
vainly
taken
with
her
the
little
boarder
got
so
curious
that
she
placed
herself
in
the
most
seducing
attitude
so
that
i
might
be
able
to
shew
her
what
i
did
seeing
this
m
m
made
her
escape
kneel
down
on
the
ledge
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
said
the
little
wanton
the
reader
will
guess
what
she
meant
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
she
would
have
succeeded
in
her
purpose
if
the
fire
which
consumed
me
had
not
distilled
itself
away
just
at
the
happy
moment
the
charming
novice
felt
herself
sprinkled
but
after
ascertaining
that
nothing
more
could
be
done
she
withdrew
in
some
vexation
my
fingers
however
consoled
her
for
the
disappointment
and
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
look
happy
once
more
i
left
these
charming
creatures
in
the
evening
promising
to
visit
them
again
in
a
year
but
as
i
walked
home
i
could
not
help
reflecting
how
often
these
asylums
supposed
to
be
devoted
to
chastity
and
prayer
contain
in
themselves
the
hidden
germs
of
corruption
how
many
a
timorous
and
trustful
mother
is
persuaded
that
the
child
of
her
affection
will
escape
the
dangers
of
the
world
by
taking
refuge
in
the
cloister
but
behind
these
bolts
and
bars
desires
grow
to
a
frenzied
extreme
they
crave
in
vain
to
be
satisfied
when
i
returned
to
the
inn
i
took
leave
of
the
wounded
man
whom
i
was
happy
to
see
out
of
danger
in
vain
i
urged
him
to
make
use
of
my
purse
he
told
me
with
an
affectionate
embrace
that
he
had
sufficient
money
and
if
not
he
had
only
to
write
to
his
father
i
promised
to
stop
at
lyons
and
to
oblige
desarmoises
to
desist
from
any
steps
he
might
be
taking
against
them
telling
them
i
had
a
power
over
him
which
would
compel
him
to
obey
i
kept
my
word
after
we
had
kissed
and
said
i
took
his
future
bride
into
my
room
that
we
might
sup
together
and
enjoy
ourselves
till
midnight
but
she
could
not
have
been
very
pleased
with
my
farewell
salute
for
i
was
only
able
to
prove
my
love
for
her
once
as
m
m
young
friend
had
nearly
exhausted
me
i
started
at
and
the
next
day
i
reached
the
hotel
du
parc
at
lyons
i
sent
for
desarmoises
and
told
him
plainly
that
his
daughter
charms
had
seduced
me
that
i
thought
her
lover
worthy
of
her
and
that
i
expected
him
out
of
friendship
for
me
to
consent
to
the
marriage
i
went
further
and
told
him
that
if
he
did
not
consent
to
everything
that
very
instant
i
could
no
longer
be
his
friend
and
at
this
he
gave
in
he
executed
the
requisite
document
in
the
presence
of
two
witnesses
and
i
sent
it
to
chamberi
by
an
express
messenger
this
false
marquis
made
me
dine
with
him
in
his
poor
house
there
was
nothing
about
his
younger
daughter
to
remind
me
of
the
elder
and
his
wife
inspired
me
with
pity
before
i
left
i
managed
to
wrap
up
six
louis
in
a
piece
of
paper
and
gave
it
to
her
without
the
knowledge
of
her
husband
a
grateful
look
shewed
me
how
welcome
the
present
was
i
was
obliged
to
go
to
paris
so
i
gave
desarmoises
sufficient
money
for
him
to
go
to
strasburg
and
await
me
there
in
company
with
my
spaniard
i
thought
myself
wise
in
only
taking
costa
but
the
inspiration
came
from
my
evil
genius
i
took
the
bourbonnais
way
and
on
the
third
day
i
arrived
at
paris
and
lodged
at
the
hotel
du
esprit
in
the
street
of
the
same
name
before
going
to
bed
i
sent
costa
with
a
note
to
madame
promising
to
come
and
dine
with
her
the
next
day
costa
was
a
young
fellow
and
as
he
spoke
french
badly
and
was
rather
a
fool
i
felt
sure
that
madame
would
take
him
for
some
extraordinary
being
she
wrote
to
say
that
she
was
impatiently
expecting
me
how
did
the
lady
receive
you
costa
she
looked
into
a
mirror
sir
and
said
some
words
i
could
make
nothing
of
then
she
went
round
the
room
three
times
burning
incense
then
she
came
up
to
me
with
a
majestic
air
and
looked
me
in
the
face
and
at
last
she
smiled
very
pleasantly
and
told
me
to
wait
for
a
reply
in
the
