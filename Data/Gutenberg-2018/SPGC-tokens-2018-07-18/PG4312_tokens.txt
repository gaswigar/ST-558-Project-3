chapter
i
an
undergraduate
at
leisure
wilfrid
athel
went
down
invalided
a
few
days
after
the
beginning
of
trinity
term
the
event
was
not
unanticipated
at
christmas
it
had
been
clear
enough
that
he
was
overtaxing
himself
his
father
remarked
on
the
fact
with
anxiety
and
urged
moderation
his
own
peculiar
virtue
wilfrid
whose
battle
with
circumstances
was
all
before
him
declined
to
believe
that
the
body
was
anything
but
the
very
humble
servant
of
the
will
so
the
body
took
its
revenge
he
had
been
delicate
in
childhood
and
the
stage
of
hardy
naturalism
which
interposes
itself
between
tender
juvenility
and
the
birth
of
did
not
in
his
case
last
long
enough
to
establish
his
frame
in
the
vigour
to
which
it
was
tending
there
was
nothing
sickly
about
him
it
was
only
an
excess
of
nervous
vitality
that
would
not
allow
body
to
keep
pace
with
mind
he
was
a
boy
to
be
intellectually
held
in
leash
said
the
doctors
but
that
was
easier
said
than
done
what
system
of
sedatives
could
one
apply
to
a
youngster
whose
imagination
wrought
him
to
a
fever
during
a
simple
walk
by
the
seashore
who
if
books
were
forcibly
withheld
consoled
himself
with
the
composition
of
tragedies
interspersed
with
lyrics
to
which
he
supplied
original
strains
athel
conceived
a
theory
that
such
exuberance
of
emotionality
might
be
counterbalanced
by
studies
of
a
strictly
positive
nature
a
tutor
was
engaged
to
ground
young
wilfrid
in
mathematics
and
the
physical
sciences
the
result
was
that
the
enthusiasm
for
these
pursuits
communicated
itself
after
a
brief
repugnance
to
the
versatile
pupil
instincts
of
mastery
became
as
vivid
in
the
study
of
euclid
and
the
chemical
elements
as
formerly
in
the
humaner
paths
of
learning
the
plan
had
failed
in
the
upshot
wilfrid
was
sent
to
school
if
that
did
not
develop
the
animal
in
him
nothing
would
he
was
not
quite
when
the
removed
him
from
oxford
going
to
balliol
with
a
scholarship
he
had
from
the
first
been
marked
for
great
things
at
all
events
by
the
measure
of
the
schools
removal
from
the
system
of
home
education
had
in
truth
seemed
to
answer
in
some
degree
the
ends
aimed
at
the
lad
took
his
fair
share
of
cricket
and
football
and
kept
clear
of
nervous
crises
at
the
same
time
he
made
extraordinary
progress
with
his
books
he
acquired
with
extreme
facility
and
his
ambition
never
allowed
him
to
find
content
in
a
second
place
conquest
became
his
habit
he
grew
to
deem
it
the
order
of
nature
that
wilfrid
athel
name
should
come
first
in
the
list
hence
a
reputation
to
support
during
his
early
terms
at
balliol
he
fagged
as
hard
as
the
mere
dullard
whose
dear
life
depended
upon
a
first
class
and
a
subsequent
tutorship
what
he
would
make
of
himself
in
the
end
was
uncertain
university
distinctions
would
probably
be
of
small
moment
to
him
as
soon
as
they
were
achieved
for
already
he
spent
the
greater
portion
of
his
strength
in
lines
of
study
quite
apart
from
the
curriculum
and
fate
had
blessed
him
with
exemption
from
sordid
cares
he
led
in
a
set
devoted
to
what
were
called
advanced
ideas
without
flattering
himself
that
he
was
on
the
way
to
solve
the
problem
of
the
universe
he
had
satisfaction
in
reviewing
the
milestones
which
removed
him
from
the
unconscious
man
and
already
clutched
at
a
measure
of
positive
wisdom
in
the
suspicion
that
lie
might
shortly
have
to
lay
aside
his
and
recommence
his
education
under
other
teachers
as
yet
he
was
in
the
pursuit
of
learning
the
intellectual
audacity
which
was
wont
to
be
the
of
his
conversation
did
not
as
his
detractors
held
indicate
mere
bumptiousness
and
defect
of
it
was
simply
the
florid
redundancy
of
a
young
mind
which
glories
in
its
strength
and
plays
at
victory
in
anticipation
it
was
true
that
he
could
not
brook
the
semblance
of
inferiority
if
it
were
only
five
minutes
chat
in
the
quad
he
must
come
off
with
a
phrase
or
an
epigram
so
those
duller
heads
who
called
athel
affected
were
not
wholly
without
their
justification
those
who
shrugged
their
shoulders
with
the
remark
that
he
was
overdoing
it
and
would
not
last
out
to
the
end
of
the
race
enjoyed
a
more
indisputable
triumph
one
evening
when
athel
was
taking
the
brilliant
lead
in
an
argument
on
foreknowledge
absolute
his
brain
began
to
whirl
seemed
to
have
dulled
all
the
lights
before
his
eyes
and
he
fell
from
his
chair
in
a
he
needed
nothing
but
rest
that
however
was
imperative
athel
brought
him
to
london
and
the
family
went
down
at
once
to
their
house
in
surrey
wilfrid
was
an
only
son
and
an
only
child
his
father
had
been
a
widower
for
nearly
ten
years
for
the
last
three
his
house
had
been
directed
by
a
widowed
sister
rossall
who
had
twin
girls
athel
found
it
no
particular
hardship
to
get
away
from
town
and
pursue
his
work
at
the
firs
a
delightful
house
in
the
midst
of
fairest
scenery
nor
would
rossall
allow
that
the
surrender
of
high
season
cost
her
any
effort
this
lady
had
just
completed
her
year
her
girls
were
in
their
tenth
she
was
comely
and
knew
it
but
a
constitutional
indolence
had
preserved
her
from
becoming
a
woman
of
fashion
and
had
nurtured
in
her
a
reflective
mood
which
if
it
led
to
no
marked
originality
of
thought
at
all
events
contributed
to
an
appearance
of
culture
at
the
time
of
her
husband
death
she
was
at
the
point
where
graceful
inactivity
so
often
degenerates
into
slovenliness
rossall
homekeeping
tendencies
and
the
growing
childhood
of
her
twins
tended
to
persuade
her
that
her
youth
was
gone
even
the
new
spring
fashions
stirred
her
to
but
languid
interest
and
her
music
in
which
she
had
some
attainments
was
all
but
laid
aside
with
widowhood
began
a
new
phase
of
her
life
her
mourning
was
unaffected
it
led
her
to
pietism
she
spent
her
days
in
religious
observance
and
her
nights
in
the
study
of
the
gravest
literature
she
would
have
entered
the
roman
church
but
for
her
brother
interposition
the
end
of
this
third
year
of
discipline
was
bringing
about
another
change
perhaps
less
obvious
to
herself
than
to
those
who
marked
her
course
with
interest
as
several
people
did
her
reading
became
less
ascetic
she
passed
to
george
herbert
and
the
year
and
by
way
of
the
decoration
of
altars
proceeded
to
thought
for
her
personal
adornment
a
certain
journal
of
society
which
she
had
long
ago
abandoned
began
to
show
itself
occasionally
in
her
rooms
though
only
as
yet
by
oversight
left
to
view
she
spoke
with
her
brother
on
the
subject
of
certain
invitations
long
neglected
and
did
not
seem
displeased
when
he
went
beyond
her
own
motion
to
propose
the
issuing
of
cards
for
a
definite
evening
then
came
wilfrid
there
was
really
no
need
said
athel
that
she
should
transfer
herself
immediately
to
the
country
just
when
everybody
was
well
settled
in
town
but
rossall
preferred
to
go
she
was
not
sure
that
the
juncture
had
not
some
connection
with
her
own
spiritual
life
and
she
maintained
on
the
whole
a
seemly
cheerfulness
athel
was
an
egyptologist
of
some
distinction
though
not
in
person
or
manner
suggestive
of
romantic
antecedents
he
had
yet
come
by
this
taste
in
a
way
which
bordered
on
romance
travelling
in
southern
europe
at
about
the
age
which
wilfrid
had
now
reached
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
rescue
from
drowning
an
italian
gentleman
then
on
a
tour
in
greece
the
italian
had
a
fair
daughter
who
was
travelling
with
him
and
her
after
an
acquaintance
of
a
few
weeks
athel
demanded
by
way
of
recompense
her
father
was
an
enthusiastic
student
of
egyptian
antiquities
the
englishman
plied
at
one
and
the
same
time
his
wooing
and
the
study
of
hieroglyphics
with
marked
success
in
both
directions
the
athel
who
at
that
time
represented
parental
authority
or
at
all
events
claimed
filial
deference
was
anything
but
pleased
with
the
step
his
son
had
taken
he
was
a
highly
respectable
dealer
in
grain
and
after
the
manner
of
highly
respectable
men
of
commerce
would
have
had
his
eldest
son
espouse
some
countrywoman
yet
more
respectable
it
was
his
opinion
that
the
lad
had
been
entrapped
by
an
adventurous
foreigner
philip
athel
who
had
a
will
of
his
own
wedded
his
italian
maiden
brought
her
to
england
and
fought
down
prejudices
a
year
or
two
later
he
was
at
work
in
egypt
where
lie
remained
for
some
twelve
months
his
studies
progressed
subsequently
he
published
certain
papers
which
were
recognised
as
valuable
wilfrid
found
the
amusement
of
his
childhood
in
his
father
pursuit
he
began
to
decipher
hieratic
not
much
later
than
he
learned
to
read
english
scarabs
were
his
sacred
playthings
and
by
the
time
of
his
going
to
school
he
was
able
to
write
letters
home
in
a
demotic
which
would
not
perhaps
have
satisfied
champollion
or
brugsch
but
yet
was
sufficiently
marvellous
to
his
schoolfellows
and
gratifying
to
his
father
for
the
rest
philip
athel
was
a
typical
english
gentleman
he
enjoyed
sports
as
keenly
as
he
did
the
pursuit
of
his
study
he
had
scarcely
known
a
day
illness
in
his
life
owing
he
maintained
to
the
wisdom
with
which
he
arranged
his
day
three
hours
of
study
was
he
held
as
much
as
any
prudent
man
would
allow
himself
he
was
always
in
excellent
spirits
ever
ready
to
be
of
service
to
a
friend
lived
with
much
moderation
on
victuals
of
the
best
quality
procurable
took
his
autumnal
holiday
abroad
in
a
gentlemanly
manner
with
something
of
theoretic
radicalism
in
his
political
views
he
combined
a
stout
respect
for
british
social
institutions
affecting
to
be
above
vulgar
prejudices
he
was
in
reality
much
prepossessed
in
favour
of
hereditary
position
and
as
time
went
on
did
occasionally
half
wish
that
the
love
he
had
bestowed
on
his
italian
wife
had
been
given
to
some
english
lady
of
family
he
was
liberal
frank
amiably
autocratic
in
his
home
apt
to
be
peppery
with
inferiors
who
missed
the
line
of
perfect
respect
candid
and
reasonable
with
equals
or
superiors
for
his
boy
he
reserved
a
store
of
manly
affection
seldom
expressing
itself
save
in
bluff
fashion
his
sister
he
patronised
with
much
kindness
though
he
despised
her
judgment
one
had
now
and
then
a
feeling
that
his
material
circumstances
aided
greatly
in
making
him
the
genial
man
he
was
that
with
beef
and
claret
of
inferior
quality
he
might
not
have
been
altogether
so
easy
to
get
along
with
but
that
again
was
an
illustration
of
the
english
character
we
find
the
family
assembling
for
breakfast
at
the
firs
one
delightful
morning
at
the
end
of
july
the
windows
of
the
room
were
thrown
open
and
there
streamed
in
with
the
sunlight
fresh
and
delicious
odours
tonics
alike
of
mind
and
body
from
the
scotch
firs
whence
the
dwelling
took
its
name
came
a
scent
which
mingled
with
wafted
breath
from
the
remoter
heather
and
the
creepers
about
the
the
lovely
bloom
and
leafage
skirting
the
lawn
contributed
to
the
atmosphere
of
health
and
joy
it
was
nine
the
urn
was
on
the
gleaming
table
the
bell
was
sounding
athel
stepped
in
straight
from
the
lawn
fresh
after
his
ten
minutes
walk
about
the
garden
wilfrid
athel
appeared
at
the
same
moment
he
was
and
had
black
glossy
hair
his
cheeks
were
hollower
than
they
should
have
been
but
he
had
not
the
aspect
of
an
invalid
rossall
glided
into
the
room
behind
him
fresh
fair
undemonstrative
then
came
the
twins
by
name
patty
and
minnie
delicate
with
promise
of
their
mother
english
style
of
beauty
it
was
very
hard
to
distinguish
them
their
uncle
had
honestly
given
up
the
pretence
long
ago
and
occasionally
remonstrated
with
his
sister
on
the
absurdity
of
dressing
them
exactly
alike
the
last
to
enter
the
room
was
the
governess
miss
emily
hood
athel
having
pronounced
a
grace
mentioned
that
he
thought
of
running
up
to
town
did
anybody
wish
to
give
him
a
commission
rossall
looked
thoughtful
and
said
she
would
make
a
note
of
two
or
three
things
have
much
faith
in
that
porridge
regimen
wilf
remarked
the
master
of
the
house
as
he
helped
himself
to
chicken
and
tongue
are
not
highlanders
it
dangerous
to
make
diet
too
much
a
matter
of
theory
your
example
is
infectious
first
the
twins
now
miss
hood
edith
do
you
propose
to
become
a
pervert
to
porridge
have
no
taste
for
it
replied
his
sister
who
had
become
a
certain
dishonesty
about
it
moreover
athel
pursued
should
be
eaten
with
salt
milk
sugar
did
i
hear
a
suggestion
of
golden
syrup
more
honestly
called
treacle
yesterday
these
things
constitute
evasion
at
the
least
in
your
case
miss
hood
the
regimen
is
clearly
fruitful
of
ill
results
what
kind
mr
athel
it
leads
to
diminution
of
appetite
you
were
in
the
habit
of
eating
a
satisfactory
breakfast
at
present
some
two
ounces
of
that
farinaceous
mess
dear
philip
interposed
rossall
still
absently
i
hold
that
i
am
within
my
rights
asserted
her
brother
miss
hood
goes
down
into
yorkshire
in
a
state
of
emaciation
wilfrid
and
the
twins
showed
amusement
begin
with
pursued
athel
hold
that
sweet
food
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
is
a
mistake
the
appetite
is
checked
in
an
artificial
way
and
impaired
even
coffee
would
recommend
a
return
to
flagons
of
ale
suggested
wilfrid
am
not
sure
that
it
was
better
dietetically
rossall
had
taken
an
egg
but
after
fruitlessly
chipping
at
the
shell
throughout
this
conversation
put
down
her
spoon
and
appeared
to
abandon
the
effort
to
commence
her
meal
presently
she
broke
silence
speaking
with
some
diffidence
really
think
i
will
go
to
town
with
you
philip
she
said
want
some
things
you
ca
very
well
get
me
and
then
i
ought
to
go
and
see
the
redwings
i
might
persuade
beatrice
to
come
to
us
for
a
day
or
two
so
by
all
means
you
quite
sure
he
added
with
a
smile
i
could
save
you
the
trouble
of
the
journey
i
have
no
objection
to
visiting
the
redwings
think
it
will
be
better
if
i
go
myself
replied
rossall
with
a
look
might
call
on
one
or
two
other
people
having
decided
this
point
she
found
herself
able
to
crack
the
egg
the
anticipation
of
her
day
in
london
made
her
quite
gay
throughout
the
meal
the
carriage
was
at
the
door
by
ten
to
drive
to
dealing
the
nearest
station
some
four
miles
away
the
twins
had
gone
upstairs
with
miss
hood
to
their
lessons
and
wilfrid
was
sauntering
about
the
hall
his
father
paused
by
him
on
the
way
to
the
carriage
do
you
propose
to
do
with
yourself
wilf
he
asked
i
think
go
over
to
hilstead
and
lunch
there
capital
lunch
they
give
you
at
the
inn
the
last
time
i
was
there
they
cooked
me
one
of
the
best
chops
i
ever
ate
oberon
wants
exercise
make
a
day
of
it
well
not
looking
quite
so
well
i
afraid
remarked
his
father
with
genuine
solicitude
in
his
tone
been
reading
have
you
imprudences
mind
i
must
stop
that
porridge
regimen
it
suit
you
ready
edith
he
shouted
heartily
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
rossall
came
down
buttoning
her
gloves
i
were
you
wilf
she
said
go
off
somewhere
for
the
day
the
twins
will
only
worry
you
wilfrid
laughed
am
going
to
eat
unexampled
chops
at
the
waggoner
in
hilstead
he
replied
right
my
dear
boy
i
wish
you
get
fatter
i
all
right
the
landau
rolled
away
wilfrid
still
loitered
in
the
hall
a
singular
look
of
doubt
on
his
face
in
a
room
above
one
of
the
twins
was
having
a
music
lesson
a
certain
was
being
drummed
with
persistent
endeavour
at
accuracy
can
she
bear
that
morning
after
morning
the
young
man
murmured
to
himself
he
took
his
straw
hat
and
went
round
to
the
stables
oberon
was
being
groomed
wilfrid
patted
the
horse
sleek
neck
and
talked
a
little
with
the
man
at
length
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
and
prepare
for
riding
oberon
would
be
ready
for
him
in
a
few
minutes
in
the
porch
patty
ran
to
meet
him
wilfrid
exclaimed
i
caught
you
in
the
act
of
escape
was
going
to
look
for
you
said
the
child
putting
her
arm
through
his
and
swinging
upon
him
want
to
know
if
you
be
back
for
lunch
wants
to
know
and
minnie
and
miss
hood
you
are
patty
then
are
you
this
was
an
old
form
of
joke
the
child
shook
her
dark
curls
with
a
gesture
but
still
swung
on
her
cousin
as
he
moved
into
the
house
wilfrid
passed
his
arm
about
her
playfully
you
make
up
your
mind
wilf
she
asked
yes
my
mind
is
quite
made
up
he
replied
with
a
laugh
wo
you
tell
me
you
ah
about
lunch
no
i
shall
not
be
back
wo
oh
i
am
sorry
are
you
sorry
indistinguishable
little
maiden
he
asked
drawing
out
one
of
her
curls
between
his
fingers
and
letting
it
spring
back
again
into
its
circling
beauty
thought
it
would
be
so
nice
we
four
at
lunch
am
warned
to
avoid
you
the
tone
of
conversation
would
try
my
weak
head
i
am
not
capable
yet
of
intellectual
effort
the
little
girl
looked
at
him
with
puzzled
eyes
it
ca
be
helped
she
said
must
go
back
to
my
lessons
she
ran
off
and
wilfrid
went
up
to
his
when
he
came
down
oberon
was
pawing
the
gravel
before
the
door
he
mounted
and
rode
away
his
spirits
which
at
first
seemed
to
suffer
some
depression
took
vigour
once
more
from
the
air
of
the
downs
he
put
oberon
at
a
leap
or
two
then
let
the
breeze
sing
in
his
ears
as
he
was
borne
at
a
gallop
over
the
summer
land
golden
with
sunlight
in
spite
of
his
still
worn
look
health
was
manifest
in
the
upright
vigour
of
his
form
and
in
his
eyes
gleamed
the
untroubled
joy
of
existence
hope
just
now
was
strong
within
him
a
hope
defined
and
pointing
to
an
end
attainable
he
knew
that
henceforth
the
many
bounding
and
voiceful
streams
of
his
life
would
unite
in
one
strong
flow
onward
to
a
region
of
orient
glory
which
shone
before
him
as
the
bourne
hitherto
but
dimly
imagined
on
oberon
on
no
speed
that
would
not
lag
behind
the
of
a
heart
desire
let
the
stretch
of
woodland
sweep
by
like
a
dream
let
the
fair
sweet
smile
for
a
moment
and
vanish
let
the
dark
rise
and
sink
it
is
the
time
of
youth
and
hope
of
boundless
faith
in
the
world
promises
of
breathless
pursuit
hilstead
was
gained
long
before
lunch
could
be
thought
of
wilfrid
rode
on
and
circled
back
towards
the
hostelry
famous
for
chops
about
the
hour
of
noon
he
put
up
his
horse
and
strayed
about
the
village
till
his
meal
was
ready
after
he
had
eaten
it
he
smoked
a
cigar
among
hollyhocks
and
sunflowers
then
impatience
possessed
him
he
looked
at
his
watch
several
times
annoyed
to
find
that
so
little
of
the
day
was
spent
when
he
at
last
set
forth
again
it
was
to
ride
at
walking
pace
in
the
direction
of
home
he
reached
a
junction
of
roads
and
waited
there
for
several
minutes
unable
to
decide
upon
his
course
he
ended
by
throwing
the
reins
on
oberon
neck
which
way
you
will
he
said
aloud
oberon
paced
forward
to
the
homeward
route
be
it
on
then
an
hour
will
bring
us
to
the
firs
the
house
was
all
but
reached
when
wilfrid
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
straw
hat
moving
into
a
hollow
a
hundred
yards
from
the
road
he
pressed
on
at
the
gate
stood
a
gardener
he
cried
leaping
down
the
horse
to
the
stable
will
you
and
instead
of
going
up
to
the
house
he
walked
back
in
the
direction
he
had
come
till
he
reached
the
hollow
in
which
the
straw
hat
had
disappeared
miss
hood
sat
on
the
ground
reading
she
was
about
to
rise
but
wilfrid
begged
her
not
to
move
and
threw
himself
into
a
reclining
posture
saw
you
as
i
rode
past
he
said
in
a
friendly
way
suppose
the
twins
are
straying
are
at
greenhaws
was
the
reply
winter
called
for
them
immediately
after
lunch
she
will
bring
them
back
early
in
the
evening
he
plucked
sprigs
of
heather
miss
hood
turned
to
her
book
had
a
magnificent
ride
wilfrid
began
again
there
is
no
country
in
england
so
glorious
as
this
do
you
enjoy
it
much
have
never
seen
the
yorkshire
moors
the
scenery
of
course
is
of
a
much
wilder
kind
have
not
seen
them
myself
said
the
governess
thought
you
might
have
taken
your
holidays
sometimes
in
that
direction
we
used
to
go
to
a
seaside
place
in
lincolnshire
called
cleethorpes
i
suppose
you
never
heard
of
it
think
not
wilfrid
continued
to
pluck
heather
and
let
his
eyes
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
face
now
and
then
miss
hood
was
a
year
younger
than
himself
and
had
well
outgrown
girlishness
she
was
of
very
slight
build
looked
indeed
rather
frail
but
her
face
though
lacking
colour
had
the
firmness
of
health
it
was
very
broad
at
the
forehead
and
tapered
down
into
narrowness
the
eyes
seemed
set
at
an
unusual
distance
from
each
other
though
the
nose
was
thin
and
of
perfect
form
its
profile
making
but
a
slight
angle
away
from
the
line
of
the
brows
her
lips
were
large
but
finely
curved
the
chin
was
prominent
the
throat
long
she
had
warm
brown
hair
few
would
at
first
sight
have
called
her
face
beautiful
but
none
could
deny
the
beauty
of
her
hands
ungloved
at
present
they
lay
on
the
open
pages
of
the
book
unsurpassable
for
delicate
loveliness
when
he
did
not
venture
to
look
higher
wilfrid
let
his
eyes
feed
on
the
turn
of
the
wrist
the
faint
blue
lines
and
sinuous
muscles
the
pencilling
about
the
the
delicate
white
and
pink
nails
miss
hood
was
habitually
silent
when
in
the
company
of
others
than
the
children
when
she
replied
to
a
question
it
was
without
timidity
but
in
few
words
yet
her
manner
did
not
lack
cheerfulness
she
impressed
no
one
as
being
unhappy
and
alone
with
the
twins
she
was
often
gay
enough
she
was
and
had
the
manners
of
a
lady
though
in
her
position
this
was
rather
to
be
observed
in
what
she
refrained
from
doing
than
in
what
she
did
wilfrid
had
on
first
meeting
her
remarked
to
himself
that
it
must
imply
a
certain
force
of
individuality
to
vary
so
distinctly
from
the
commonplace
even
under
the
disadvantage
of
complete
he
had
now
come
to
understand
better
the
way
in
which
that
individuality
betrayed
itself
you
go
to
cleethorpes
this
year
was
his
next
question
think
not
i
shall
most
likely
pass
the
holidays
at
home
study
electricity
in
a
former
conversation
she
had
surprised
him
by
some
unexpected
knowledge
of
the
principles
of
electricity
and
explained
the
acquirement
by
telling
him
that
this
subject
was
her
father
favourite
study
wilfrid
put
the
question
now
with
a
smile
very
likely
she
replied
smiling
also
but
faintly
gives
my
father
pleasure
when
i
do
so
have
not
a
keen
interest
in
the
subject
yourself
try
to
have
her
voice
was
of
singular
quality
if
she
raised
it
the
effect
was
not
agreeable
owing
possibly
to
its
lack
of
strength
but
in
low
tones
such
as
she
employed
at
present
it
fell
on
the
ear
with
a
peculiar
sweetness
a
natural
melody
in
its
modulation
way
in
which
you
speak
of
your
father
interests
me
said
wilfrid
leaning
his
chin
upon
his
hand
and
gazing
at
her
freely
seem
so
united
with
him
in
sympathy
she
did
not
turn
her
eyes
to
him
but
her
face
gathered
brightness
sympathy
yes
she
replied
speaking
now
with
more
readiness
tastes
often
differ
but
we
are
always
at
one
in
feeling
we
have
been
companions
ever
since
i
can
remember
your
mother
living
something
in
the
tone
of
the
brief
affirmative
kept
wilfrid
from
further
questioning
wonder
he
said
you
think
of
the
relations
existing
between
myself
and
my
father
we
are
excellent
friends
do
you
think
strange
one
does
think
much
about
such
things
till
some
occasion
brings
them
forward
whether
there
is
deep
sympathy
between
us
i
could
say
certainly
there
are
many
subjects
on
which
i
should
not
dream
of
speaking
to
him
unless
necessity
arose
partly
i
suppose
that
is
male
reserve
and
partly
english
reserve
if
novels
are
to
be
trusted
french
parents
and
children
speak
together
with
much
more
freedom
on
the
whole
that
must
be
better
she
made
no
remark
father
he
continued
eminently
a
man
of
sense
if
i
reflect
on
my
boyhood
i
see
how
admirable
his
treatment
of
me
has
always
been
i
fancy
i
must
have
been
at
one
time
rather
hard
to
manage
i
know
i
was
very
passionate
and
stubbornly
yet
he
neither
let
me
have
my
own
way
nor
angered
me
by
his
opposition
in
fact
he
made
me
respect
him
now
that
we
stand
on
equal
terms
i
dare
say
he
has
something
of
the
same
feeling
towards
myself
and
so
it
comes
that
we
are
excellent
friends
she
listened
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
this
seems
to
you
a
curiously
dispassionate
way
of
treating
such
a
subject
wilfrid
added
with
a
laugh
illustrates
what
i
meant
in
saying
i
doubted
whether
there
was
deep
sympathy
between
us
your
own
feeling
for
your
father
is
clearly
one
of
devotedness
you
would
think
no
sacrifice
of
your
own
wishes
too
great
if
he
asked
it
of
you
can
not
imagine
any
sacrifice
which
my
father
could
ask
that
i
should
refuse
she
spoke
with
some
difficulty
as
if
she
wished
to
escape
the
subject
that
is
a
virtue
that
your
sex
helps
to
explain
said
wilfrid
musingly
do
not
know
he
added
when
a
bee
had
hummed
between
them
for
half
a
minute
constant
my
regret
is
that
my
mother
did
not
live
till
i
was
old
enough
to
make
a
friend
of
her
you
know
that
she
was
an
italian
there
was
a
sympathy
taken
out
of
my
life
i
believe
i
have
more
of
the
italian
nature
than
the
english
and
i
know
my
presence
would
be
priceless
to
me
now
that
i
could
talk
with
her
what
unsatisfactory
creatures
we
are
as
children
so
imperfect
so
deficient
it
is
worse
with
boys
than
with
girls
compare
for
instance
the
twins
with
boys
of
ten
what
coarse
awkward
unruly
lumps
of
boisterousness
youngsters
mostly
are
at
that
age
i
dislike
boys
and
more
than
ever
when
i
remember
myself
at
that
stage
what
an
insensible
ungrateful
brainless
and
heartless
brat
i
was
must
be
wrong
in
one
respect
she
returned
watching
a
large
butterfly
could
not
have
been
brainless
the
foundation
of
tolerable
wits
was
there
no
doubt
but
it
is
just
that
undeveloped
state
that
irritates
me
suppose
i
were
now
ten
years
old
and
that
glorious
butterfly
before
me
should
i
not
leap
at
it
and
stick
a
pin
through
it
young
savage
precisely
what
a
hottentot
boy
would
do
except
that
he
would
be
free
from
the
apish
folly
of
pretending
a
scientific
interest
not
really
existing
i
rejoice
to
have
lived
out
of
my
boyhood
i
would
not
go
through
it
again
for
anything
short
of
a
thousand
years
of
subsequent
maturity
she
just
glanced
at
him
a
light
of
laughter
in
her
eyes
she
was
abandoning
herself
to
the
pleasure
of
hearing
him
speak
picture
of
my
mother
he
pursued
dropping
his
voice
again
not
do
her
justice
even
at
twelve
years
old
she
died
when
i
was
twelve
i
could
not
help
seeing
and
knowing
how
beautiful
she
was
i
have
thought
of
her
of
late
more
than
i
ever
did
sometimes
i
suffer
a
passion
of
grief
that
one
so
beautiful
and
lovable
has
gone
and
left
a
mere
dumb
picture
i
suppose
even
my
memory
of
her
will
grow
fainter
and
fainter
founded
as
it
is
on
imperfect
understanding
dim
appreciation
she
used
to
read
italian
to
me
first
the
italian
then
the
english
and
i
thought
it
as
often
as
not
a
bore
to
have
to
listen
to
her
thank
heaven
i
have
the
book
she
used
and
can
now
go
over
the
pieces
and
try
to
recall
her
voice
the
butterfly
was
gone
but
the
bee
still
hummed
about
them
the
hot
afternoon
air
was
unstirred
by
any
breeze
glad
i
am
wilfrid
exclaimed
when
he
had
brooded
for
a
few
moments
i
happened
to
see
you
as
i
rode
past
i
should
have
wandered
restlessly
about
the
house
in
vain
seeking
for
some
one
to
talk
to
and
you
listen
so
patiently
it
is
pleasant
to
be
here
and
talk
so
freely
of
things
i
have
always
had
to
keep
in
my
own
mind
look
do
look
at
that
bastion
of
cloud
over
the
sycamore
what
glorious
gradation
of
tints
what
a
snowy
crown
is
a
pretty
spray
he
added
holding
to
her
one
that
he
had
plucked
she
looked
at
it
then
as
he
still
held
it
out
took
it
from
him
the
exquisite
fingers
touched
his
own
redder
and
coarser
ones
you
friends
in
dunfield
he
asked
real
friend
i
mean
any
girl
who
gives
you
real
companionship
that
shall
you
spend
your
time
when
you
are
not
deep
in
electrics
what
do
you
mean
to
read
these
holidays
german
i
think
i
have
only
just
begun
to
read
it
i
ca
read
it
at
all
now
and
then
i
make
a
shot
at
the
meaning
of
a
note
in
a
german
edition
of
some
classical
author
every
time
fretting
at
my
ignorance
but
there
is
so
endlessly
much
to
do
and
a
day
is
so
short
it
hateful
he
broke
forth
enforced
idleness
of
mine
to
think
that
weeks
and
weeks
go
by
and
i
remain
just
where
i
was
when
the
loss
of
an
hour
used
to
seem
to
me
an
irreparable
misfortune
i
have
such
an
appetite
for
knowledge
surely
the
unhappiest
gift
a
man
can
be
endowed
with
it
leads
to
nothing
but
frustration
perhaps
the
appetite
weakens
as
one
grows
in
years
perhaps
the
sphere
of
one
keener
interests
contracts
i
hope
it
may
be
so
at
times
i
can
not
work
i
mean
i
could
not
for
a
sense
of
the
vastness
of
the
field
before
me
i
should
like
you
to
see
my
rooms
at
balliol
shelves
have
long
since
refused
to
take
another
volume
floor
tables
chairs
every
spot
is
heaped
and
there
they
lie
hosts
i
have
scarcely
looked
into
many
i
shall
never
have
time
to
take
up
to
the
end
of
my
days
have
the
satisfaction
of
being
able
to
give
your
whole
time
to
study
is
precisely
the
source
of
dissatisfaction
my
whole
time
and
that
wholly
insufficient
i
have
a
friend
a
man
i
envy
intensely
he
has
taken
up
the
subject
of
celtic
literature
gives
himself
to
it
with
cares
for
nothing
that
does
not
connect
itself
therewith
will
pursue
it
throughout
his
life
will
know
more
of
it
than
any
man
living
my
despair
is
the
universality
of
my
interests
i
can
think
of
no
branch
of
study
to
which
i
could
not
surrender
myself
with
enthusiasm
of
course
i
shall
never
master
one
my
subject
is
the
history
of
humanity
i
would
know
everything
that
man
has
done
or
thought
or
felt
i
can
not
separate
lines
of
study
philology
is
a
passion
with
me
but
how
shall
i
part
the
history
of
speech
from
the
history
of
thought
the
etymology
of
any
single
word
will
hold
me
for
hours
to
follow
it
up
i
must
traverse
centuries
of
human
culture
they
tell
me
i
have
a
faculty
for
philosophy
in
the
narrow
sense
of
the
word
alas
that
narrow
sense
implies
an
exhaustive
knowledge
of
speculation
in
the
past
and
of
every
result
of
science
born
in
our
own
time
think
of
the
sunny
spaces
in
the
world
history
in
each
of
which
one
could
linger
for
ever
athens
at
her
fairest
rome
at
her
grandest
the
glorious
savagery
of
merovingian
courts
the
kingdom
of
frederick
the
moors
in
spain
the
magic
of
renaissance
italy
to
become
a
citizen
of
any
one
age
means
a
lifetime
of
endeavour
it
is
easy
to
fill
one
head
with
names
and
years
but
that
only
sharpens
my
hunger
then
there
is
the
world
of
art
i
would
know
every
subtlest
melody
of
verse
in
every
tongue
enjoy
with
perfectly
instructed
taste
every
form
that
man
has
carved
or
painted
i
fear
to
enter
museums
and
galleries
i
am
distracted
by
the
numberless
desires
that
seize
upon
me
depressed
by
the
hopelessness
of
satisfying
them
i
can
not
even
enjoy
music
from
the
mere
feeling
that
i
do
not
enjoy
it
enough
that
i
have
not
had
time
to
study
it
that
i
shall
never
get
at
its
secret
and
when
is
one
to
live
i
can
not
lose
myself
in
other
men
activity
and
enjoyments
i
must
have
a
life
of
my
own
outside
the
walls
of
a
library
it
would
be
easy
to
give
up
all
ambition
of
knowledge
to
forget
all
the
joy
and
sorrow
that
has
been
and
passed
into
nothingness
to
know
only
the
eternity
of
a
present
hour
might
one
not
learn
more
in
one
instant
of
unreflecting
happiness
than
by
toiling
on
to
a
mummied
age
only
to
know
in
the
end
the
despair
of
never
having
lived
he
again
raised
his
eyes
to
her
face
it
was
fixed
in
a
cold
absent
gaze
her
lips
hardened
into
severity
the
pose
of
her
head
impressive
noble
athel
regarded
her
for
several
moments
she
was
revealing
to
him
more
of
her
inner
self
than
he
had
yet
divined
are
your
thoughts
he
asked
quietly
she
smiled
recovering
her
wonted
passiveness
you
not
often
much
the
same
troubles
arc
only
for
the
mind
which
is
strong
enough
to
meet
and
overcome
them
she
replied
look
my
mind
has
given
way
already
i
am
imbecile
for
ever
i
shall
be
on
the
point
of
a
and
each
successive
one
will
bring
me
nearer
to
some
final
catastrophe
perhaps
the
lunatic
asylum
who
knows
should
think
she
said
gravely
you
suggested
a
truth
very
likely
your
mind
will
contract
its
range
and
cease
to
aim
at
the
impossible
tell
me
have
you
not
yourself
already
attained
that
wisdom
why
should
you
make
pretences
of
feebleness
which
does
not
mark
you
you
have
a
mind
as
active
as
my
own
i
know
that
perfectly
well
what
is
your
secret
of
contentment
wo
you
help
me
in
this
miserable
plight
athel
i
have
none
but
very
ordinary
powers
of
mind
and
perhaps
it
is
my
recognition
of
that
which
keeps
me
contented
there
is
indeed
one
principle
of
guidance
which
i
have
worked
out
for
myself
and
that
will
not
enlighten
you
for
it
is
only
the
choice
of
a
natural
and
easy
course
seeing
that
difficult
ones
are
closed
the
literature
of
learning
is
out
of
my
reach
so
i
limit
myself
to
the
literature
of
beauty
and
in
this
i
try
to
keep
to
the
best
are
right
you
are
right
to
know
the
masterpieces
of
literature
pure
literature
poetry
in
its
widest
sense
that
is
the
wise
choice
think
we
feed
ourselves
with
the
secondhand
wisdom
of
paltry
philosophisers
and
critics
and
shakespeare
waits
outside
the
door
with
the
bread
of
life
from
homer
alas
you
do
not
read
greek
she
shook
her
head
you
work
at
german
in
heaven
name
change
your
language
forthwith
why
should
you
not
know
greek
you
know
greek
i
will
give
you
books
i
will
advise
you
show
you
the
essentials
to
begin
with

still
a
few
days
before
you
go
into
yorkshire

can
work
during
the
holidays
on
lines
i
shall
set

you
can
write
and

me

paused
for
her
face
had
lost
its
smile
and
wore
again
that
coldly
respectful
look
which
she
seldom
put
off
save
in
her
privacy
with
the
children
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
he
had
marked
in
her
quite
another
aspect
the
secret
meanings
of
her
face
had
half
uttered
themselves
in
eye
and
lip
his
last
words
seemed
to
recall
her
to
the
world
of
fact
she
made
a
slight
movement
and
closed
the
book
on
her
lap
is
more
than
i
can
undertake
athel
she
said
in
a
quietly
decided
tone
must
be
content
with
translations
you
would
not
say
that
so
calmly
if
you
knew
what
you
were
renouncing
everything
everything
in
literature
i
would
give
up
to
save
my
greek
you
will
learn
it
i
know
you
will
some
day
i
shall
hear
you
read
the
hexameters
as
beautifully
as
you
read
english
poetry
to
the
girls
will
you
not
begin
if
i
beg
you
to
the
elbow
on
which
he
rested
moved
a
few
inches
nearer
to
her
he
saw
the
pearly
shadows
waver
upon
her
throat
and
her
lips
tremble
into
rigidity

in
the
holidays
will
be
very
limited

said

undertaken
to
give
some
help
to
a
friend
who
is
preparing
to
become
a
teacher
and
she
tried
to
smile
do
think
i
must
do
more
work
whilst
at
home
than
is
really
necessary
that
is
true
wilfrid
assented
unwillingly
mind
there
is
plenty
of
time
greek
will
be
overcome
you
will
see
when
we
are
all
back
in
town
and
the
days
are
dull
then
i
shall
succeed
in
persuading
you
she
looked
about
her
as
if
with
thought
of
quitting
her
place
her
companion
was
drawn
into
himself
he
stroked
mechanically
with
his
the
fronds
of
bracken
near
him
suppose
i
shall
go
up
again
in
october
he
began
wish
there
were
no
necessity
for
it
surely
it
is
your
one
desire
the
other
replied
in
genuine
surprise
to
return
to
oxford
a
few
months
ago
it
would
have
been
but
this
crisis
in
my
life
has
changed
me
i
do
think
i
shall
adapt
myself
again
to
those
conditions
i
want
to
work
in
a
freer
way
i
had
a
positive
zeal
even
for
examinations
now
that
seems
tame
well
boyish
i
believe
i
have
outgrown
that
stage
i
feel
a
reluctance
to
go
back
to
school
i
suppose
i
must
take
my
degree
and
so
on
but
it
will
all
be
against
the
grain
feeling
will
most
likely
alter
when
you
have
thoroughly
recovered
your
health
i
do
think
it
will
practically
my
health
is
all
right
you
do
he
added
with
a
smile
me
as
an
irresponsible
person
whose
feeble
remarks
are
to
be
received
with
kind
allowance
i
did
not
mean
that
he
gazed
at
her
and
his
face
showed
a
growing
trouble
do
not
take
too
seriously
what
i
said
just
now
about
the
weakness
of
my
mind
it
would
be
horrible
if
you
thought
i
had
worked
myself
into
a
state
of
amiable
imbecility
and
was
incapable
henceforth
of
acting
thinking
or
speaking
with
a
sound
intellect
tell
me
say
in
plain
words
that
is
not
your
way
of
interpreting
me
he
had
become
very
much
in
earnest
raising
himself
to
a
position
in
which
he
rested
on
one
hand
he
looked
straight
into
her
face
do
you
reply
why
do
you
speak
athel
it
is
surely
needless
to
say
that
i
have
no
such
thought
it
is
not
needless
and
even
now
you
speak
in
a
way
which
troubles
me
do
not
look
away
from
me
what
has
my
aunt
told
you
about
me
she
turned
her
face
to
him
her
was
so
complete
that
not
a
throb
of
her
leaping
heart
betrayed
itself
in
vein
or
muscle
she
even
met
his
eyes
with
a
placid
gaze
which
he
felt
as
a
new
aspect
of
her
countenance
rossall
has
never
spoken
to
me
of
your
health
she
said
my
father
jokes
he
has
a
way
of
humorous
exaggeration
you
of
course
understand
that
you
do
take
seriously
all
he
says
think
i
can
distinguish
between
jest
and
earnest
all
that
you
speak
of
the
recovery
of
my
health
as
if
i
were
still
far
from
the
wholly
rational
so
far
from
my
being
mentally
unsound
this
rest
has
been
a
with
me
before
i
did
nothing
but
heap
my
memory
with
knowledge
of
books
now
i
have
had
leisure
to
gather
knowledge
of
a
deeper
kind
i
was
a
academical
monster
it
needed
this
new
sense
to
make
me
human
the
old
college
life
is
no
longer
my
ideal
i
doubt
if
it
will
be
possible
at
any
rate
i
shall
hurry
over
the
rest
of
my
course
as
speedily
as
may
be
that
i
may
begin
really
to
live
you
must
credit
what
i
am
saying
i
want
you
to
give
me
distinct
assurance
that
you
do
so
if
i
have
the
least
doubt
it
will
trouble
my
mind
in
earnest
miss
hood
rose
to
her
feet
in
that
graceful
effortless
way
of
which
girls
have
the
secret
attribute
a
meaning
to
my
words
that
i
never
thought
of
she
said
again
in
the
distant
respectful
manner
wilfrid
also
rose
you
give
me
credit
for
understanding
myself
for
being
as
much
master
of
my
mind
as
i
am
of
my
actions
i
do
mr
athel
are
going
to
the
house
it
is
nearly
five
your
conscience
tells
you
that
a
civilised
being
must
drink
tea
i
think
i
shall
walk
over
to
greenhaws
i
may
as
well
save
winter

trouble
of
bringing
back
the
children

before
moving
away

that
cloud
has
changed
its
form
i
should
like
to
stay
here
and
watch
it
till
sunset
in
a
week
i
suppose
i
shall
be
looking
at
some
such
cloud
over

chapter
ii
beatrice
redwing
midway
in
breakfast
next
morning
at
a
moment
when
rossall
was
describing
certain
originalities
of
decoration
observed
on
the
previous
day
at
a
house
in
town
the
door
admitted
a
young
lady
who
had
time
to
glance
round
the
assembled
family
before
her
presence
was
observed
in
appearance
she
was
very
interesting
the
tints
of
her
fine
complexion
were
warmed
by
exercise
in
the
morning
air
and
her
dark
eyes
brightened
by
pleasurable
excitement
she
carried
her
hat
in
her
hand
and
seemed
to
have
been
walking
for
there
were
signs
of
in
her
abundant
black
hair
but
neither
face
nor
attire
suggested
rusticity
the
former
was
handsome
spirited
with
a
hint
of
uncommon
things
in
its
changeful
radiance
the
latter
was
the
result
of
perfect
taste
choosing
at
will
among
the
season
costumes
at
her
throat
were
fastened
two
blossoms
of
wild
rose
with
the
dew
still
on
them
and
the
hand
which
held
her
sunshade
carried
also
a
spray
of
athel
looking
up
from
the
end
of
the
table
was
the
first
to
perceive
her
ben
ben
son
ben
son
he
exclaimed
rising
and
moving
from
his
place
how
in
the
world
has
she
got
here
cried
rossall
following
the
general
direction
of
eyes
already
but
you
surely
have
come
from
town
this
morning
indeed
i
have
was
the
reply
in
a
joyous
voice
whose
full
rich
quality
took
the
ear
captive
you
let
me
sit
down
just
as
i
am
patty
here
a
rose
for
you
and
minnie
another
for
you
she
took
them
from
her
dress
do
you
do
mr
wilfrid
the
governess
was
mentioned
to
her
by
name
beatrice
looked
at
her
steadfastly
for
a
moment
how
have
you
got
here
inquired
rossall
must
have
left
london
at
an
hour
and
how
have
yen
come
from
dealing
she
has
walked
said
athel
you
see
the
spoils
of
her
progress
yes
i
have
walked
replied
the
girl
suppose
i
in
a
dreadful
state
towards
the
end
i
almost
ran
i
was
so
afraid
lest
i
should
miss
breakfast
and
you
ca
imagine
how
hungry
i
am
is
that
oatmeal
porridge
you
are
eating
wilfrid
oh
do
let
me
have
some
how
delicious
it
will
be
beatrice
interposed
rossall
athel
give
you
some
of
that
pate
or
will
you
have
been
a
vegetarian
for
a
month
was
the
reply
do
mean
it
strictly
no
eggs
are
not
permitted
only
the
feebler
school
allows
them
you
ca
think
how
much
better
i
have
been
in
body
and
mind
since
i
adopted
the
new
diet
whatever
train
did
you
start
by
pressed
rossall
six
i
never
can
sleep
these
short
summer
nights
i
was
up
about
five
and
just
as
i
was
going
to
read
i
saw
the
railway
i
looked
for
the
first
train
and
determined
to
come
by
it
i
wrote
a
short
note
to
let
mother
know
what
had
become
of
me
then
in
a
minute
or
two
i
got
my
things
packed
and
last
of
all
stole
out
of
the
house
to
find
a
cab
luckily
a
policeman
was
just
passing
the
door
he
found
one
for
me
in
no
time
not
a
soul
was
up
so
i
dragged
the
trunk
out
on
to
the
landing
and
then
made
the
cabman
creep
upstairs
like
a
burglar
to
fetch
it
of
course
he
thought
i
was
running
away
he
enjoyed
the
joke
wonderfully
you
should
have
seen
his
smile
when
i
paid
him
at
the
station
perhaps
you
let
them
fetch
my
luggage
before
lunch
wo
your
mother
be
alarmed
asked
rossall
should
she
she
knows
i
am
very
capable
of
taking
care
of
myself
i
would
have
missed
this
walk
for
anything
i
only
lost
my
way
once
and
then
luckily
a
farmer
came
driving
along
he
told
me
i
had
half
a
mile
more
i
trebled
his
distance
which
made
it
about
right
a
good
four
miles
from
the
station
remarked
athel
it
if
i
had
been
so
hungry
i
should
have
minded
as
much
again
you
not
angry
with
me
rossall
for
coming
before
i
was
expected
a
curious
note
of
irresponsible
childishness
came
out
now
and
then
in
her
talk
as
in
this
last
question
it
was
the
more
noticeable
for
the
air
of
maturity
and
which
on
the
whole
characterised
her
she
continued
to
talk
with
much
vivacity
making
at
the
same
time
a
hearty
meal
her
place
at
the
table
was
between
wilfrid
and
patty
on
the
opposite
side
sat
miss
hood
and
minnie
as
often
as
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
governess
face
they
rested
there
for
a
moment
searchingly
as
if
with
endeavour
to
recall
some
memory
is
responsible
for
your
vegetarianism
wilfrid
asked
cresset
preaching
the
doctrine
cresset
is
not
preaching
the
doctrine
was
the
reply
in
a
tone
which
evidently
contained
reference
to
previous
dissensions
there
is
nothing
offensive
in
the
suggestion
remarked
the
young
man
mildly
there
is
something
offensive
your
references
to
cresset
are
always
offensive
do
me
injustice
aunt
i
take
you
to
witness
did
i
praise
ungrudgingly
a
sermon
of
his
we
heard
last
christmas
remember
quite
well
said
beatrice
regarded
it
as
extraordinary
that
anything
good
could
come
from
that
source
athel
i
take
you
to
witness
was
that
his
tone
interposed
rossall
change
your
place
and
sit
between
those
two
they
never
can
be
next
each
other
without
quarrelling
breakfast
drew
out
to
unusual
length
miss
redwing
was
full
of
the
season
news
and
rossall
reviving
interest
in
such
vanities
scarcely
affected
concealment
athel
too
though
he
supported
a
jesting
tone
clearly
enjoyed
listening
to
the
girl
vivacious
comments
on
the
world
which
amuses
itself
wilfrid
talked
less
than
usual
he
and
his
father
strolled
together
into
the
garden
an
hour
later
and
found
beatrice
reclining
in
a
hammock
which
had
recently
been
suspended
in
a
convenient
spot
she
had
one
hand
beneath
her
head
the
other
held
a
large
fan
with
which
she
warded
off
stray
flakes
of
sunlight
falling
between
the
leaves
this
exquisite
she
cried
no
one
hint
to
me
of
stirring
before
i
am
going
to
enjoy
absolute
laziness
thought
you
would
have
preferred
a
gallop
over
the
downs
said
athel
we
have
that
this
afternoon
you
may
talk
of
it
now
and
i
shall
relish
it
in
anticipation
or
better
still
sit
down
and
tell
us
old
stories
about
egypt
and
let
us
forget
the
age
we
live
in
is
amiss
with
the
age
inquired
athel
who
stood
smoking
a
cigar
and
was
in
his
wonted
state
of
satisfaction
with
himself
and
the
universe
is
amiss
if
you
had
been
with
me
yesterday
in
a
street
i
was
visiting
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
home
but
i
going
to
forget
all
that
now
how
deliciously
warm
it
is
here
in
the
shade
i
must
have
a
hammock
in
our
garden
at
cowes
do
you
go
back
athel
asked
about
a
fortnight
it
has
done
mother
no
end
of
good
do
you
think
she
looks
remarkably
well
rossall
i
afraid
she
finds
it
a
little
dull
though
when
his
father
had
returned
to
the
house
wilfrid
sat
in
the
grass
and
rested
his
head
against
the
arm
of
the
low
garden
chair
in
which
rossall
was
reclining
the
sound
of
a
alone
mingled
with
the
light
rustling
of
the
trees
it
was
one
of
those
perfect
summer
mornings
when
the
sun
rays
though
streaming
from
a
cloudless
sky
are
tempered
by
a
gentle
haze
in
the
upper
regions
of
the
air
when
the
zenith
has
a
tinge
of
violet
and
on
the
horizon
broods
a
reddish
mist
from
this
part
of
the
garden
only
a
glimpse
of
the
house
was
visible
an
upper
window
with
white
curtains
cool
peaceful
all
else
on
every
side
was
verdure
and
bloom
it
possible
beatrice
asked
when
there
had
been
silence
for
a
few
moments
i
can
have
met
miss
hood
anywhere
before
her
face
is
strangely
familiar
to
me
has
never
been
in
london
before
she
came
to
us
said
rossall
you
have
relatives
in
dunfield
i
think
remarked
wilfrid
be
sure
said
his
aunt
comes
from
dunfield
in
yorkshire
do
you
think
you
can
have
met
her
there
that
explains
it
beatrice
cried
eagerly
knew
i
had
seen
her
and
i
know
now
where
it
was
she
gave
lessons
to
my
uncle
children
i
saw
her
when
i
was
staying
there
the
last
time
three
no
four
years
ago
i
ca
recall
her
by
her
name
but
her
face
oh
i
remember
it
as
clearly
as
possible
a
memory
you
have
beatrice
said
rossall
never
forget
a
face
that
strikes
me
what
way
did
miss
hood
face
strike
you
wilfrid
asked
as
if
in
idle
curiosity
and
with
some
of
the
banter
which
always
marked
his
tone
to
beatrice
would
like
some
deep
metaphysical
reason
but
i
am
not
advanced
enough
for
that
i
do
suppose
i
thought
much
about
her
at
the
time
but
the
face
has
stayed
in
my
mind
but
how
old
is
she
said
rossall
smiling
year
older
than
myself
my
impression
was
that
she
was
more
than
that
i
think
i
only
saw
her
once
she
was
with
us
at
lunch
one
day
we
spoke
of
her
shyness
i
remember
she
scarcely
said
a
word
all
the
time
she
is
very
shy
assented
rossall
a
mistake
i
think
aunt
said
wilfrid
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
reticence
then
conceded
the
lady
with
a
smile
to
beatrice
all
events
she
is
very
quiet
and
agreeable
and
it
is
such
a
good
thing
to
have
a
governess
who
really
seems
it
does
make
it
so
much
easier
to
treat
her
with
consideration
the
children
like
her
beatrice
asked
much
indeed
and
it
wonderful
how
she
controls
them
they
are
little
creatures
she
go
abroad
with
you
no
i
do
think
that
necessary
wilfrid
presently
left
the
two
to
their
gossip
the
conversation
naturally
turned
to
him
is
his
health
beatrice
asked
seems
quite
recovered
i
do
think
there
was
ever
anything
to
occasion
much
alarm
but
his
father
got
frightened
i
expect
we
shall
bring
him
back
from
switzerland
as
well
as
ever
he
was
ever
has
he
done
with
himself
the
last
two
months
mused
the
girl
it
has
been
rather
hard
to
keep
him
occupied
away
from
books
he
has
been
riding
a
good
deal
and
smoking
a
good
deal
talking
a
good
deal
yes
wilf
is
fond
of
talking
admitted
rossall
i
do
think
he
anything
like
as
positive
as
he
was
he
does
now
and
then
admit
that
other
people
may
have
an
opinion
which
is
worth
entertaining
celia
dawlish
was
with
us
a
fortnight
ago
she
declared
him
vastly
improved
told
him
so
that
was
in
private
to
me
i
think
celia
and
he
always
got
on
well
together
said
beatrice
in
an
idly
meditative
tone
moving
the
edge
of
her
fan
backwards
and
forwards
a
few
inches
above
her
face
a
few
minutes
later
after
a
silence
she
said
you
know
what
i
am
thinking
asked
rossall
with
an
air
of
interest
if
i
were
to
close
my
eyes
and
keep
quiet
i
should
very
soon
be
fast
asleep
the
other
laughed
at
the
unexpected
reply
why
not
do
so
dear
it
warm
enough
you
could
take
any
harm
suppose
the
walk
has
tired
me
if
you
had
no
sleep
last
night
how
is
it
you
ca
sleep
i
wonder
is
it
the
same
when
you
are
at
cowes
only
in
london
something
troubles
me
i
feel
that
i
have
neglected
duties
i
hear
voices
as
distinct
as
yours
now
reproving
me
for
my
idle
frivolous
life
i
am
sure
you
are
neither
idle
nor
frivolous
do
doze
off
if
you
can
dear
i
go
and
get
something
to
read
wo
be
angry
with
me
the
girl
asked
in
the
tone
of
an
affectionate
weary
child
shall
if
you
use
ceremony
with
me
beatrice
sighed
folded
her
hands
upon
the
fan
and
closed
her
lids
when
rossall
returned
from
the
house
with
a
magazine
and
a
light
shawl
the
occupant
of
the
hammock
was
already
sound
asleep
she
threw
the
shawl
with
womanly
skill
and
gentleness
over
the
shapely
body
when
she
had
resumed
her
seat
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
wilfrid
at
a
little
distance
her
beckoned
summons
brought
him
near
she
whispered
pointing
to
the
hammock
did
you
see
a
prettier
picture
the
young
man
gazed
with
a
free
smile
the
expression
of
critical
appreciativeness
the
girl
beauty
stirred
in
him
no
mood
but
that
she
slept
with
complete
calm
of
feature
the
that
came
through
the
foliage
made
an
exquisite
pallor
on
her
face
contrasting
with
the
dark
masses
of
her
hair
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
in
the
softest
sighing
her
pure
throat
was
like
marble
and
her
just
parted
lips
seemed
to
need
a
protector
from
the
bees
while
she
sleeps
let
us
learn
a
little
more
of
her
history
some
years
previously
alfred
redwing
was
a
lecturer
on
greek
and
latin
at
a
small
college
in
the
north
of
england
making
shift
to
live
on
a
beggarly
stipend
handsome
pleasing
not
quite
thirty
he
was
well
received
in
such
semblance
of
society
as
his
town
offered
and
in
spite
of
his
defects
as
a
suitor
he
won
for
his
wife
a
certain
miss
baxendale
the
daughter
of
a
manufacturer
she
brought
him
at
once
a
few
hundreds
a
year
and
he
pursued
his
college
work
in
improved
spirits
his
wife
had
two
brothers
one
had
early
gone
to
america
the
other
was
thriving
as
a
man
of
business
in
the
town
of
dunfield
with
laurence
baxendale
who
dated
his
very
occasional
letters
from
various
parts
of
the
united
states
the
family
might
be
said
to
have
parted
for
good
before
leaving
england
he
had
got
on
ill
terms
with
his
father
and
brother
and
it
was
only
a
persistent
affection
for
his
sister
that
caused
him
to
give
any
sign
of
himself
year
after
year
when
this
sister
had
been
redwing
for
about
two
years
she
one
day
received
an
intimation
from
solicitors
that
laurence
was
dead
and
had
left
her
the
whole
of
a
very
considerable
fortune
the
product
mainly
of
dealings
in
lumber
and
redwing
in
fact
found
themselves
possessed
of
nearly
fourteen
thousand
a
year
proceeding
from
most
orderly
investments
this
would
naturally
involve
a
change
in
their
mode
of
life
in
the
first
place
they
paid
a
visit
to
america
then
they
settled
in
london
where
about
the
same
time
their
only
child
beatrice
was
born
a
month
after
the
child
coming
into
the
world
the
father
withdrew
from
it
into
a
private
lunatic
asylum
he
had
not
been
himself
from
the
day
when
he
heard
of
the
fortune
that
had
come
to
him
such
an
access
of
blessedness
was
not
provided
for
in
the
constitution
of
his
mind
probably
few
men
of
his
imaginative
temperament
and
hard
antecedents
could
have
borne
the
change
without
some
little
unsettling
of
mental
balance
we
are
framed
to
endure
any
amount
of
ill
but
have
to
take
our
chance
in
the
improbable
event
of
vast
joy
befalling
us
poor
redwing
conceived
a
suspicion
that
his
wife
desired
to
murder
him
one
night
as
she
was
following
him
into
their
bedroom
he
suddenly
turned
round
caught
hold
of
her
with
violence
and
flung
her
to
the
ground
demanding
the
knife
which
he
protested
he
had
seen
gleam
in
her
hand
it
was
no
longer
safe
to
live
with
him
he
was
put
under
restraint
and
never
again
knew
freedom
in
less
than
a
year
he
died
a
moping
maniac
redwing
was
an
invalid
thenceforth
probably
it
was
only
the
existence
of
her
child
that
saved
her
life
an
affection
of
the
heart
in
course
of
time
declared
itself
but
though
her
existence
was
believed
to
hang
on
a
thread
she
lived
on
and
on
lived
to
see
beatrice
grow
to
womanhood
she
kept
a
small
house
in
london
but
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
year
at
home
or
foreign
her
relatives
had
supposed
that
she
would
return
to
her
own
country
but
redwing
had
tastes
which
lacked
gratification
in
a
provincial
manufacturing
town
without
having
achieved
much
positive
culture
she
had
received
from
her
husband
an
impulse
towards
the
development
of
certain
higher
possibilities
in
her
nature
and
she
liked
the
society
of
mentally
active
people
the
state
of
her
health
alone
withheld
her
from
a
second
marriage
she
was
not
a
very
patient
invalid
and
suffered
keenly
in
the
sense
of
missing
the
happiness
which
life
had
offered
her
in
the
matter
of
her
daughter
education
she
exercised
much
care
doctrinal
religion
had
a
strong
hold
upon
her
and
it
was
her
solicitude
that
beatrice
should
walk
from
the
first
in
the
ways
of
anglican
salvation
she
dreaded
the
of
the
age
with
a
better
judgment
in
pure
literature
than
falls
to
the
lot
of
most
women
or
men
either
she
yet
banished
from
her
abode
wherever
it
might
be
anything
that
remotely
savoured
of
intellectual
emancipation
her
aesthetic
leanings
she
deemed
the
great
temptation
of
her
life
for
she
frankly
owned
to
her
friends
that
many
things
powerfully
attracted
her
which
her
conscience
bade
her
shun
as
dangerous
her
generosity
made
her
a
shining
light
in
the
world
which
busies
itself
in
the
dispensing
or
receiving
of
ecclesiastical
charity
the
clerical
element
was
very
strong
in
the
circle
that
surrounded
her
at
the
same
time
her
worldly
tastes
did
not
go
altogether
ungratified
she
was
very
fond
of
music
and
her
unlimited
powers
in
the
provision
of
musical
entertainment
brought
to
her
house
acquaintances
of
a
kind
that
would
not
otherwise
have
been
found
there
the
theatre
she
tabooed
regarding
this
severity
as
an
acceptable
sacrifice
and
not
troubling
to
reflect
what
share
her
had
in
rendering
it
a
fairly
easy
one
in
brief
she
was
a
woman
of
a
genial
nature
whose
inconsistencies
were
largely
due
to
her
inability
to
outgrow
early
conditions
beatrice
inherited
her
mother
mental
restrictions
but
was
endowed
with
a
subtlety
of
nature
which
aided
by
her
circumstances
made
her
yet
more
a
being
of
inconsistencies
and
contradictions
in
religion
it
was
not
enough
for
her
to
conform
zeal
drove
her
into
the
extremest
forms
of
ritualistic
observance
nor
did
care
for
her
personal
salvation
suffice
the
logic
of
a
compassionate
nature
led
her
on
to
various
forms
of
missionary
activity
she
haunted
vile
localities
ministering
alike
to
soul
and
body
at
the
same
time
she
relished
keenly
the
delights
of
the
masquerading
sphere
where
her
wealth
and
her
beauty
made
her
doubly
welcome
from
praying
by
the
bedside
of
a
costermonger
wife
she
would
speed
away
to
shine
among
the
brightest
in
phantasmagoric
her
mother
could
seldom
accompany
her
but
there
was
always
some
one
ready
to
chaperon
beatrice
redwing
once
in
the
world
from
which
thought
is
banished
she
seemed
as
thoughtless
as
any
her
spiritual
convictions
put
no
veto
even
upon
dancing
yet
her
mood
at
such
times
was
not
the
entire
of
the
girl
who
is
born
but
to
waltz
in
spite
of
the
sanction
of
custom
she
could
not
wholly
suppress
her
virginal
instincts
and
however
unconsciously
something
in
her
nature
held
itself
aloof
she
led
a
life
of
indecision
combining
in
herself
such
contradictory
elements
she
was
unable
to
make
close
friendships
her
intimacy
with
rossall
which
dated
from
her
late
childhood
was
not
the
perfect
accord
which
may
subsist
between
women
of
very
different
characters
yet
here
she
gave
and
received
more
sympathy
than
elsewhere
it
was
her
frequent
saying
that
she
came
to
rossall
house
when
she
wanted
to
rest
here
she
could
be
herself
could
pass
without
interval
from
pietistic
argument
to
chatter
about
her
neighbours
could
indulge
in
impulses
of
confession
as
with
no
one
else
could
put
off
the
strain
of
existence
which
was
the
result
of
her
conflicting
impulses
but
it
was
only
during
a
portion
of
the
year
that
she
could
have
rossall
society
at
other
times
though
no
one
suspected
it
she
suffered
much
from
loneliness
with
her
mother
she
was
in
accord
on
the
subjects
of
religion
and
music
but
even
natural
affection
blending
with
these
sympathies
could
not
bring
about
complete
unity
in
her
home
there
was
the
same
lack
that
she
experienced
in
the
outer
world
for
all
her
versatility
she
was
not
in
appearance
emotional
no
one
seemed
less
likely
to
be
overcome
by
passion
her
enthusiasms
fell
short
of
the
last
note
of
sincerity
perhaps
it
was
on
this
account
that
she
produced
no
strong
impression
in
spite
of
her
beauty
her
personality
suffered
on
acquaintance
from
defect
of
charm
was
it
a
of
this
that
led
her
now
and
then
into
the
curious
affectation
of
childishness
already
remarked
did
she
feel
unable
to
rely
for
pleasing
upon
those
genuine
possessions
which
for
sonic
reason
could
never
advantageously
display
themselves
for
more
than
an
hour
she
slept
at
her
waking
she
found
minnie
standing
by
her
side
your
lessons
over
she
asked
passing
at
once
into
full
consciousness
without
sign
of
having
slept
the
child
replied
that
they
were
is
miss
hood
the
beatrice
rose
and
they
walked
towards
the
together
it
was
in
a
corner
of
the
garden
hidden
among
acacias
and
laurels
a
circular
hut
in
the
ordinary
style
patty
and
the
governess
were
seated
within
beatrice
entered
and
took
a
scat
with
them
your
memory
as
good
as
my
own
miss
hood
she
said
pleasantly
you
remember
our
meeting
four
years
ago
the
other
regarded
her
with
quiet
surprise
and
said
she
had
no
recollection
of
the
meeting
at
baxendale
my
uncle
one
day
that
you
lunched
with
us
when
i
was
staying
there
miss
hood
had
wholly
forgotten
the
circumstance
it
served
however
for
the
commencement
of
a
conversation
which
went
en
till
rossall
finding
the
hammock
deserted
was
guided
by
the
sound
of
voices
to
where
the
two
girls
and
the
children
sat
in
the
afternoon
there
was
a
setting
forth
into
the
country
athel
drove
his
sister
and
the
children
wilfrid
and
beatrice
accompanied
them
on
horseback
the
course
to
be
pursued
having
been
determined
the
riders
were
not
at
pains
to
keep
the
carriage
always
within
sight
did
miss
hood
decline
to
come
athel
inquired
shortly
after
they
had
started
she
gave
no
reason
rossall
replied
was
her
choice
to
stay
at
home
course
you
asked
her
in
a
proper
way
philip
of
course
i
did
hood
never
alters
her
mind
remarked
patty
exclaimed
the
other
twin
with
decision
admirable
characteristic
commented
their
uncle
her
decision
is
right
to
begin
with
beatrice
had
just
led
off
at
a
gallop
wilfrid
necessarily
followed
her
when
the
pace
slackened
they
began
to
talk
of
indifferent
things
on
the
crest
of
a
hill
whence
the
carriage
could
be
seen
far
away
on
the
white
road
the
girl
reined
in
and
turning
to
her
companion
asked
abruptly
is
your
opinion
of
miss
hood
do
you
ask
such
a
question
i
should
like
to
know
she
interests
me
and
you
must
have
had
opportunities
enough
lately
of
studying
her
character
does
she
interest
you
ca
say
i
thought
you
might
help
me
to
discover
the
reason
you
have
often
said
that
you
liked
women
of
strongly
marked
character
do
you
conclude
that
she
is
one
feel
it
we
were
talking
together
before
lunch
i
do
think
i
like
her
i
do
think
she
has
principles
wilfrid
laughed
the
word
is
vague
you
mean
no
doubt
that
she
seem
to
have
commonplace
prejudices
just
what
i
wanted
you
to
say
she
let
her
horse
move
on
the
young
man
followed
his
eyes
gazing
absently
before
him
a
smile
fixed
upon
his
lips
beatrice
looked
over
her
shoulder
she
read
the
same
kind
of
books
that
you
do
i
read
no
books
at
all
she
paused
again
to
let
him
get
to
her
side
a
pity
it
ca
continue
inability
to
read
is
the
kindest
remark
i
have
heard
for
a
long
time
exclaimed
wilfrid
with
a
laugh
likely
it
is
though
you
do
mean
it
when
you
read
you
only
poison
your
mind
it
is
your
reading
that
has
made
you
what
you
are
without
faith
without
feeling
you
dissect
everything
you
calculate
motives
cynically
you
have
learnt
to
despise
everyone
who
believes
what
you
refuse
to
you
make
your
own
intellect
the
centre
of
the
world
you
are
dangerous
a
character
to
whom
am
i
dangerous
anyone
whom
it
pleases
you
to
tempt
in
whom
you
find
the
beginnings
of
disbelief
brief
i
have
no
principles
course
you
have
none
other
words
i
am
selfish
so
it
was
hard
to
discover
whether
she
were
in
earnest
wilfrid
examined
her
for
a
moment
and
concluded
that
she
must
be
her
eyes
were
gleaming
with
no
mock
seriousness
and
there
was
even
a
slight
quiver
about
her
lips
in
all
their
exchanges
of
banter
he
had
never
known
her
look
and
speak
quite
as
she
did
now
as
he
regarded
her
there
came
a
flush
to
her
cheek
she
turned
her
head
away
and
rode
on
what
moves
you
to
visit
me
with
this
castigation
at
present
miss
redwing
he
asked
still
maintaining
his
jesting
tone
do
know
she
answered
carelessly
felt
all
at
once
able
to
say
what
i
thought
you
do
really
think
all
this
i
do
he
kept
silence
a
little
you
ca
see
he
began
rather
more
seriously
you
are
deplorably
lacking
in
the
charity
which
surely
should
be
among
principles
are
some
things
to
which
charity
must
not
be
extended
us
say
then
discretion
insight
he
spoke
yet
more
earnestly
judge
me
and
in
truth
you
know
as
little
of
me
as
anyone
could
the
attitude
of
your
mind
prevents
you
from
understanding
me
in
the
least
it
prevents
you
from
understanding
any
human
being
you
are
consumed
with
prejudice
and
prejudice
of
the
narrowest
most
hopeless
kind
am
i
too
severe
more
so
than
you
have
often
been
many
a
time
you
have
told
me
how
you
despised
me
he
was
silent
then
spoke
impulsively
perhaps
the
word
is
not
too
strong
though
it
is
not
your
very
self
that
i
despise
but
the
ignorance
and
bigotry
which
possess
you
it
is
a
pity
i
believe
you
might
be
a
woman
of
quite
a
different
kind
pronounced
character
you
are
neither
one
thing
nor
another
you
have
told
me
what
you
think
of
me
shall
i
be
equally
frank
and
speak
as
if
you
were
a
college
friend
for
at
all
events
we
friends
am
not
sure
of
that
but
i
am
and
we
shall
be
friends
none
the
worse
for
ingenuousness
on
both
sides
look
at
the
position
in
which
you
stand
one
moment
you
arc
a
woman
of
the
world
the
next
you
run
frantic
with
religious
zeal
another
turn
and
you
are
almost
an
artist
at
your
piano
when
you
are
tired
of
all
these
you
become
or
try
to
become
a
sort
of
in
the
name
of
consistency
be
one
thing
or
another
you
are
quite
mistaken
in
thinking
that
i
despise
religious
enthusiasm
in
itself
become
a
veritable
beatrice
and
i
will
venerate
you
infinitely
give
up
everything
to
work
in
london
slums
and
you
shall
have
my
warmest
admiration
but
you
are
not
sincere
am
sincere
she
broke
in
with
more
passion
than
he
had
ever
imagined
her
capable
of
uttering
can
not
call
it
sincerity
it
is
impossible
that
you
should
be
sincere
you
live
in
the
latter
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
conditions
of
your
birth
and
education
forbid
sincerity
of
this
kind
am
sincere
she
repeated
but
in
a
low
voice
without
looking
at
him
the
other
hand
he
proceeded
yourself
entirely
to
the
life
of
society
and
i
will
still
respect
you
you
are
a
beautiful
woman
you
might
be
inexpressibly
charming
frankly
recognise
your
capabilities
and
cultivate
your
charm
make
a
study
of
your
loveliness
make
it
your
end
to
be
a
queen
in
insult
me
ca
see
that
i
do
there
is
nothing
contemptible
in
such
an
aim
nothing
is
contemptible
that
is
thorough
or
you
have
the
third
course
pursue
music
with
seriousness
become
a
real
artist
a
public
singer
let
us
say
no
amateur
nonsense
recognise
that
you
have
a
superb
voice
and
that
by
dint
of
labour
you
may
attain
artistic
excellence
you
talk
of
getting
up
concerts
in
low
parts
of
london
of
humanising
ruffians
by
the
influence
of
music
pshaw
humanise
humanity
at
large
by
devotion
to
an
artistic
ideal
the
other
aim
is
paltry
imbecile
charlatan
he
tried
to
see
her
face
she
rode
on
holding
it
averted
any
one
of
these
courses
and
you
will
make
of
yourself
a
true
woman
by
trying
to
be
a
bit
of
everything
you
become
insignificant
napoleon
the
great
was
a
curse
to
mankind
but
one
thinks
more
of
him
than
of
napoleon
the
little
who
was
quite
sure
whether
to
be
a
curse
or
a
blessing
there
is
a
self
in
every
one
of
us
the
end
of
our
life
is
to
discern
it
bring
it
out
make
it
actual
you
do
yet
know
your
own
self
you
have
not
the
courage
to
look
into
your
heart
and
mind
you
keep
over
your
eyes
the
bandage
of
dogmas
in
which
you
only
half
believe
your
insincerity
blights
the
natural
qualities
of
your
intellect
you
have
so
long
tried
to
persuade
yourself
of
the
evil
of
every
way
of
thinking
save
ecclesiastical
dogmatism
that
you
can
not
judge
fairly
even
those
to
whom
you
are
most
friendly
can
not
you
see
that
the
world
has
outgrown
the
possibility
of
one
universal
religion
for
good
or
for
evil
each
of
us
must
find
a
religion
in
himself
and
you
have
no
right
whatever
to
condemn
before
you
have
understood
can
not
say
that
you
have
any
religion
she
said
facing
him
he
saw
to
his
astonishment
that
there
had
been
tears
in
her
eyes
can
not
say
that
i
have
none
the
radical
fault
of
your
uninstructed
way
of
looking
at
things
is
that
you
imagine
mankind
and
the
world
to
be
matters
of
such
simple
explanation
you
learn
by
heart
a
few
maxims
half
a
dozen
phrases
and
there
is
your
key
to
every
mystery
that
is
the
child
state
of
mind
you
have
never
studied
you
have
never
thought
your
is
ludicrous
you
and
such
as
you
do
not
hesitate
to
judge
offhand
men
who
have
spent
a
long
life
in
the
passionate
pursuit
of
wisdom
you
have
no
reverence
it
is
the
fault
you
attribute
to
me
but
wrongly
if
you
had
ever
brought
an
open
mind
to
our
conversations
you
would
have
understood
that
my
reverence
even
for
your
ideal
is
not
a
wit
less
than
your
own
it
is
only
that
i
see
it
in
another
light
you
say
that
i
have
no
religion
what
if
i
have
not
are
one
final
conclusions
to
be
achieved
in
a
year
or
two
of
early
manhood
i
have
my
inner
voices
and
i
try
to
understand
them
often
enough
they
are
ambiguous
contradictory
i
live
in
hope
that
their
bidding
will
become
clearer
i
search
for
meanings
try
to
understand
myself
strive
after
knowledge
might
as
well
have
been
born
a
pagan
one
voice
has
spoken
its
bidding
is
the
sufficient
and
only
guide
rather
that
so
it
seems
to
you
your
inheritance
of
conviction
is
not
mine
your
mode
of
reasoning
and
my
own
have
nothing
in
common
we
inhabit
different
worlds
beatrice
let
her
eyes
turn
slowly
to
his
face
the
smile
with
which
he
met
her
found
no
reflection
on
her
countenance
her
look
was
that
of
one
who
realises
a
fatality
we
join
them
she
asked
in
a
moment
nodding
towards
the
carriage
which
was
about
to
hide
itself
among
trees
wilfrid
mused
instead
of
answering
she
began
to
ride
on
one
minute
he
said
have
been
anything
but
courteous
in
my
way
of
speaking
to
you
but
it
was
better
to
put
off
idle
forms
was
it
not
i
shall
know
henceforth
what
you
think
of
me
from
this
one
conversation
if
you
mean
that
it
does
not
matter
not
difference
of
opinion
has
fortunately
little
to
do
with
kindness
am
not
sure
that
you
are
right
at
all
events
when
it
has
expressed
itself
in
words
of
contempt
it
was
not
resentment
that
her
voice
conveyed
but
some
thing
which
wilfrid
found
it
harder
to
bear
her
drooped
eyelids
and
subdued
tone
indicated
a
humble
pride
which
the
protest
of
her
beauty
made
pathetic
will
never
speak
of
such
things
again
he
said
gently
me
have
your
forgiveness
when
we
join
them
down
there
they
will
laugh
at
us
and
say
we
have
been
quarrelling
as
usual
in
future
i
think
we
quarrel
we
are
both
of
us
getting
too
old
for
the
amusement
when
you
sing
to
us
i
shall
remember
how
foolish
i
was
even
to
pretend
contempt
will
be
thinking
she
said
i
am
a
mere
amateur
i
do
i
shall
be
an
ungrateful
wretch
and
an
insensible
one
to
boot
she
rode
down
the
hill
without
replying
chapter
iii
lyrical
miss
hood
did
not
of
course
dine
with
the
family
though
as
rossall
said
it
was
a
distinct
advantage
to
have
in
the
house
a
governess
whom
one
could
in
many
respects
treat
as
an
equal
yet
there
was
naturally
a
limit
in
this
as
in
all
other
matters
we
have
not
yet
either
in
fact
or
in
sentiment
quite
outgrown
the
social
stage
in
which
personal
hiring
sets
on
the
hired
a
stigma
of
servitude
rossall
was
not
unaware
that
in
all
that
concerned
intellectual
refinement
her
governess
was
considerably
superior
to
herself
and
in
personal
refinement
not
less
a
lady
but
the
fact
of
quarterly
payments
spite
of
all
this
inevitably
indicated
a
place
below
the
salt
athel
though
as
we
have
seen
anxious
to
indulge
himself
in
humane
regard
whenever
social
regulations
permitted
was
the
last
man
to
suffer
in
his
household
serious
innovations
upon
traditional
propriety
so
miss
hood
emily
as
she
was
called
by
the
little
group
of
people
away
in
yorkshire
to
whom
she
was
other
than
a
governess
emily
as
we
will
permit
ourselves
to
call
her
henceforth
always
had
the
meal
of
tea
with
the
children
after
that
the
evening
was
her
own
save
that
the
twins
kept
her
company
until
their
hour
of
bedtime
the
was
also
her
after
eight
in
the
evening
she
had
it
to
herself
and
there
she
passed
many
an
hour
of
quiet
content
playing
softly
on
the
piano
reading
dreaming
in
the
matter
of
books
she
was
well
off
athel
and
his
sister
had
subscriptions
at
several
london
libraries
and
of
these
the
governess
was
invited
to
make
free
use
it
was
some
restraint
upon
her
that
her
choice
of
reading
always
passed
under
bossall
eyes
but
not
so
much
after
the
first
few
weeks
the
widow
was
by
this
time
well
advanced
in
the
resumption
of
purely
mundane
literature
and
the
really
liberal
tone
which
prevailed
in
the
house
removed
apprehension
in
the
pursuit
of
modern
studies
for
it
was
rather
an
ideal
towards
which
she
was
working
than
an
attainment
in
fact
that
eclecticism
of
which
she
spoke
to
wilfrid
athel
the
monthly
library
lists
which
came
under
her
eyes
offered
many
a
sore
temptation
she
was
true
on
the
whole
to
her
system
she
did
not
read
at
random
and
never
read
frivolously
but
a
taste
strongly
directed
to
the
best
in
literature
will
find
much
in
the
work
of
our
day
especially
its
criticism
which
is
indispensable
as
guidance
or
attractive
by
its
savour
this
was
not
emily
first
access
fortunately
to
the
streams
of
contemporary
thought
already
she
had
enjoyed
and
largely
used
opportunities
of
the
most
various
reading
she
was
able
now
to
choose
with
discretion
and
in
a
great
degree
to
make
her
study
serve
directly
the
scheme
of
culture
which
she
had
devised
for
herself
few
governesses
had
so
pleasant
a
life
rossall
supported
by
her
brother
views
imposed
on
her
children
a
minimum
of
bodily
health
was
after
all
the
first
thing
especially
in
the
case
of
girls
a
couple
of
hours
school
in
the
morning
one
hour
given
to
preparation
of
lessons
after
tea
this
for
the
present
was
deemed
quite
enough
companionship
throughout
the
day
will
always
be
forming
their
minds
rossall
said
in
one
of
her
earliest
conversations
with
emily
it
was
pleasantly
put
and
truer
than
it
would
have
been
in
the
ease
of
many
instructresses
the
twins
were
not
remarkably
fond
of
their
lessons
but
in
emily
hands
they
became
docile
and
anxious
to
please
she
had
the
art
of
winning
their
affection
without
losing
control
over
them
had
bossall
rather
languid
habits
of
mind
allowed
her
to
give
attention
to
the
subject
she
would
have
been
struck
with
the
singular
combination
of
tenderness
and
reverence
which
the
two
entertained
towards
their
teacher
little
laxities
of
behaviour
arid
phrase
upon
which
their
mother
presence
would
be
no
check
they
did
not
venture
to
allow
themselves
when
with
emily
her
only
reproof
was
a
steady
gaze
eloquent
of
gentleness
but
it
proved
quite
sufficient
the
twins
were
in
truth
submitting
to
the
force
of
character
they
felt
it
without
understanding
what
it
meant
one
ether
person
in
the
house
experienced
the
same
influence
but
in
his
case
it
led
to
reflection
wilfrid
was
at
balliol
when
miss
hood
first
arrived
he
saw
her
for
the
first
time
when
he
came
to
town
after
his
collapse
all
hastened
away
to
the
firs
together
wilfrid
suffered
no
positive
illness
he
shared
in
the
amusements
of
the
family
and
with
the
exception
of
a
good
deal
of
pishing
and
pshawing
at
the
restraints
put
upon
him
had
the
appearance
of
one
taking
an
ordinary
holiday
there
was
undeniable
truth
in
beatrice
redwing
allusion
to
his
much
talking
without
social
intercourse
he
would
soon
have
become
ill
in
earnest
association
with
intelligent
all
the
better
if
argumentative
people
was
an
indispensable
condition
of
his
existence
in
his
later
school
and
early
college
days
this
tendency
to
give
free
utterance
to
his
thoughts
made
him
not
altogether
the
most
delightful
of
companions
to
such
as
were
older
than
himself
his
undeniable
cleverness
and
the
stores
of
knowledge
he
had
already
acquired
needed
somewhat
more
of
the
restraint
of
tact
than
his
character
at
that
time
supplied
people
occasionally
called
him
a
prig
now
and
then
he
received
what
the
vernacular
of
youth
terms
sitting
upon
the
saving
feature
of
his
condition
was
that
he
allowed
himself
to
be
sat
upon
gracefully
a
snub
well
administered
to
him
was
sure
of
its
full
artistic
and
did
not
fail
in
its
moral
effect
there
was
no
vulgar
insolence
in
the
young
fellow
what
he
received
he
could
acknowledge
that
he
deserved
a
term
or
two
at
balliol
put
this
right
in
mingling
with
some
that
were
his
equals
and
one
or
two
who
were
his
superiors
he
learned
prudence
in
the
regulation
of
his
speech
for
a
brief
time
he
perhaps
talked
not
quite
so
much
when
his
was
formed
the
currents
of
argument
and
rhetoric
had
once
more
free
course
but
they
were
beginning
to
flow
less
turbidly
his
nature
as
we
know
was
not
merely
vehement
he
had
the
instincts
of
a
philosophical
inquirer
and
his
intellect
speedily
outgrew
the
stage
of
callowness
when
he
came
down
for
his
first
the
change
in
him
was
so
marked
that
it
astonished
all
who
met
him
that
he
appeared
wholly
unconscious
of
the
ripening
he
had
undergone
only
made
his
development
more
impressive
he
had
gone
away
a
boy
and
returned
a
man
he
talked
no
less
than
ever
but
in
a
markedly
improved
tone
he
was
graver
more
seemly
in
the
buoyant
outbreaks
in
which
he
still
occasionally
indulged
one
reason
of
his
rapid
maturing
no
doubt
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
was
already
working
too
hard
his
sprightliness
was
in
a
measure
subdued
by
wear
of
tissue
his
father
was
shrewd
enough
to
suspect
something
of
this
but
it
was
difficult
to
interfere
in
any
way
a
month
in
switzerland
seemed
to
set
things
right
on
the
present
more
serious
occasion
it
had
been
deemed
better
not
to
set
forth
on
a
journey
forthwith
perfect
repose
at
the
house
in
surrey
was
all
that
was
advised
in
the
first
instance
but
it
was
clear
that
wilfrid
must
have
some
one
to
talk
with
a
succession
of
visits
from
such
friends
as
were
available
was
speedily
arranged
by
the
end
of
the
first
week
wilfrid
had
accommodated
himself
to
his
circumstances
his
fretting
at
the
regulations
imposed
for
his
health
almost
ceased
at
first
this
change
was
viewed
with
suspicion
especially
when
he
became
more
absorbed
in
reflectiveness
and
seemed
to
have
less
taste
for
conversation
however
he
was
perfectly
cheerful
there
were
no
further
symptoms
to
excite
alarm
nor
did
the
brooding
period
last
very
long
the
only
permanent
change
was
that
he
ceased
to
grumble
at
his
hard
lot
and
appeared
to
find
his
position
very
tolerable
is
the
physical
reaction
observed
athel
to
his
sister
body
is
indulging
itself
recovery
of
health
absorbs
his
energies
opportunities
for
anything
like
sustained
converse
with
miss
hood
wilfrid
found
very
few
and
far
between
only
once
before
the
long
talk
in
the
hollow
had
he
been
able
to
gratify
his
curiosity
perhaps
already
some
other
feeling
in
a
dialogue
of
any
intimacy
in
a
situation
such
as
this
delicacy
prescribed
a
very
rigid
discretion
emily
moreover
was
not
facile
of
approach
throughout
the
day
she
was
scarcely
away
from
the
children
of
course
he
could
and
did
often
exchange
words
with
her
in
the
presence
of
the
twins
but
he
felt
himself
held
at
a
distance
by
a
tact
which
was
perfect
without
undue
reserve
without
a
shadow
of
unrefined
manoeuvring
emily
limited
their
intercourse
in
precisely
the
way
that
athel
or
rossall
would
have
deemed
becoming
then
there
were
almost
always
guests
at
the
house
with
prudent
regard
to
the
character
of
these
visitors
rossall
chose
opportunities
for
inviting
the
governess
to
the
during
the
evening
but
emily
was
not
wholly
at
her
ease
under
such
conditions
and
wilfrid
was
withheld
by
only
motives
from
talking
with
her
at
these
times
he
shrank
from
subjecting
himself
to
examination
whilst
encouraging
her
to
speak
on
the
subjects
he
would
naturally
choose
he
felt
too
that
she
desired
him
not
to
address
her
though
this
perception
came
to
him
in
subtle
ways
of
which
he
could
render
to
himself
no
account
for
all
this
their
acquaintance
nay
their
intimacy
grew
if
ever
eyes
habitually
expressed
a
frankness
if
ever
any
were
incapable
of
ignoble
artifice
they
were
emily
yet
as
time
went
on
wilfrid
began
to
long
for
the
casual
meeting
with
her
glance
for
the
mere
reason
that
he
felt
it
as
an
exchange
of
words
between
her
and
himself
thus
it
was
that
when
at
length
the
first
real
conversation
came
it
seemed
the
sequel
of
many
others
seemed
so
to
both
of
them
they
had
divined
each
other
speech
did
but
put
the
seal
of
confirmation
on
knowledge
gained
by
mutual
sympathy
it
may
be
presumed
that
neither
athel
nor
rossall
was
altogether
regardless
of
possibilities
suggested
by
the
abiding
beneath
the
same
roof
of
an
impetuous
young
man
forced
into
idleness
and
a
girl
who
was
above
the
average
in
mental
endowments
whilst
on
the
whole
she
might
be
considered
interesting
in
appearance
they
exchanged
no
remark
on
the
subject
it
was
scarcely
likely
they
should
but
during
the
first
few
weeks
both
were
observant
their
observations
were
reassuring
to
them
and
indeed
they
had
not
anticipated
trouble
for
the
simple
reason
that
both
believed
wilfrid
affections
to
tend
already
in
a
marked
direction
and
one
of
which
they
altogether
approved
that
he
would
some
day
take
for
his
wife
beatrice
redwing
was
a
conclusion
upon
which
father
and
aunt
had
settled
their
minds
the
conclusion
was
reasonable
enough
and
well
supported
by
such
evidence
as
the
ease
admitted
athel
had
at
an
earlier
period
entertained
certain
misgivings
as
to
the
desirability
of
such
a
marriage
misgivings
which
had
reference
to
the
disastrous
story
of
the
redwing
household
the
conception
of
hereditary
tendencies
has
become
a
strong
force
in
our
time
and
pronounced
madness
in
a
parent
can
not
as
easily
be
disregarded
as
it
once
was
but
the
advantages
of
the
alliance
were
so
considerable
its
likelihood
so
indisputable
that
prudence
had
scarcely
fair
play
besides
beatrice
had
reached
her
year
without
any
sign
of
mental
trouble
and
seemed
as
sound
a
girl
as
could
anywhere
be
discovered
the
habitual
between
her
and
wilfrid
was
naturally
regarded
as
their
mode
of
growing
endeared
to
each
other
their
intellectual
variances
could
not
by
a
sober
gentleman
of
and
by
a
young
widow
whose
interest
in
the
world
was
reviving
be
regarded
as
a
bar
to
matrimony
beatrice
would
not
bring
but
she
was
certain
to
inherit
very
large
fortune
which
after
all
means
more
than
family
nowadays
on
the
whole
it
was
a
capital
thing
for
wilfrid
that
marriage
would
be
entered
upon
in
so
smooth
a
way
athel
was
not
forgetful
of
his
own
course
in
that
matter
he
understood
his
father
attitude
as
he
could
not
when
resisting
it
and
was
much
disposed
to
concede
that
there
might
have
been
two
opinions
as
to
his
own
proceeding
years
ago
but
for
beatrice
the
young
man
matrimonial
future
would
have
been
to
his
father
a
subject
of
constant
apprehension
as
it
was
the
situation
lost
much
of
its
natural
hazard
in
emily
there
was
nothing
that
suggested
sentimentality
rather
one
would
have
thought
her
deficient
in
sensibility
judging
from
the
tone
of
her
conversation
she
did
not
freely
express
admiration
even
in
the
form
of
assent
to
what
was
said
by
others
to
interpret
her
reticence
as
shyness
was
a
misunderstanding
or
a
misuse
of
words
natural
in
the
case
of
an
inexact
observer
like
rossall
four
years
ago
when
beatrice
met
her
in
dunfield
her
want
of
was
pronounced
enough
she
had
at
that
time
never
quitted
her
provincial
home
and
was
in
the
anomalous
position
of
one
who
is
intellectually
outgrowing
very
restricted
social
circumstances
the
baxendales
were
not
wrong
in
discussing
her
as
shy
but
that
phase
of
her
life
was
now
left
far
behind
her
extreme
moderation
was
deliberate
it
was
her
concession
to
the
fate
which
made
her
a
governess
courtesy
and
kindliness
might
lead
those
whose
bread
she
ate
to
endeavour
occasionally
to
remove
all
show
of
social
distinction
neither
her
temperament
nor
her
sense
of
comeliness
in
behaviour
would
allow
her
to
shrink
from
such
advances
but
she
could
not
lose
sight
of
the
unreality
of
the
situations
to
which
they
led
is
conditioned
by
the
influence
of
circumstance
on
character
in
emily
it
expressed
itself
as
a
subtle
sensitiveness
to
grades
of
sympathy
she
could
not
shut
her
eyes
to
the
actuality
of
things
sincerity
was
the
foundation
of
her
being
and
delicate
appreciation
of
its
degrees
in
others
regulated
her
speech
and
demeanour
with
an
exactitude
inappreciable
by
those
who
take
life
in
a
rough
and
ready
way
when
engaged
in
her
work
of
teaching
she
was
at
ease
alone
in
the
room
which
had
been
set
apart
for
her
she
lived
in
the
freedom
of
her
instincts
but
in
rossall
she
could
only
act
a
part
and
all
such
divergence
from
reality
was
pain
it
was
not
that
she
resented
her
subordination
for
she
was
almost
devoid
of
social
ambitions
and
knew
nothing
of
vulgar
envy
still
less
did
it
come
of
reasoned
revolt
against
the
artificial
ordering
of
precedences
thoughts
did
not
tend
that
way
she
could
do
perfect
justice
to
the
amiable
qualities
of
those
who
were
set
above
her
she
knew
no
bitterness
in
the
food
which
she
duly
earned
but
by
no
one
fault
there
was
a
vein
of
untruth
in
the
life
she
had
to
lead
to
remind
herself
that
such
untruth
was
common
to
all
lives
was
an
outcome
of
the
conditions
of
society
did
not
help
her
to
disregard
it
nature
had
endowed
her
with
a
stern
idealism
which
would
not
ally
itself
with
compromise
she
was
an
artist
in
life
the
task
before
her
a
task
of
which
in
these
days
she
was
growing
more
and
more
conscious
was
to
construct
an
existence
every
moment
of
which
should
serve
an
harmony
the
recent
birth
within
her
of
a
new
feeling
was
giving
direction
and
vigour
to
the
forces
of
her
being
it
had
not
as
yet
declared
itself
as
a
personal
desire
it
wrought
only
as
an
impassioned
motive
in
the
sphere
of
her
intellectual
aspirations
she
held
herself
more
persistently
apart
from
conventional
intercourse
she
wished
it
had
been
possible
to
keep
wholly
to
herself
in
the
hours
when
her
services
were
not
demanded
athel
who
liked
to
express
himself
to
young
people
with
a
sort
of
paternal
geniality
rallied
her
one
day
on
her
excessive
study
and
bade
her
be
warned
by
a
notorious
example
this
had
the
effect
of
making
her
desist
from
reading
in
the
presence
of
other
people
she
had
known
much
happiness
during
these
two
months
at
the
firs
happiness
of
a
kind
to
dwell
in
the
memory
and
be
a
resource
in
darker
days
though
mere
personal
ease
was
little
the
subject
of
her
thoughts
she
prized
for
its
effect
upon
her
mind
the
air
of
graceful
leisure
of
urbane
repose
which
pervaded
the
house
to
compare
the
firs
with
that
plain
little
dwelling
on
the
skirts
of
a
yorkshire
manufacturing
town
which
she
called
her
home
was
to
understand
the
inestimable
advantage
of
those
born
into
the
material
refinement
which
wealth
can
command
of
those
who
breathe
from
childhood
the
atmosphere
of
liberal
enjoyment
who
walk
from
the
first
on
clean
ways
with
minds
disengaged
from
anxiety
of
casual
soilure
who
know
not
even
by
domestic
story
the
trammels
of
sordid
preoccupation
thus
it
was
with
a
sense
of
that
she
stepped
on
rich
carpets
let
her
eyes
wander
over
the
light
and
dark
of
rooms
where
wealth
had
done
the
bidding
of
taste
watched
the
neat
and
silent
ministering
of
servants
these
things
to
her
meant
priceless
opportunity
the
facilitating
of
even
the
little
room
in
which
she
sat
by
herself
of
evenings
was
daintily
furnished
when
weary
with
reading
it
eased
and
delighted
her
merely
to
gaze
at
the
soft
colours
of
the
the
vases
with
their
growing
flowers
the
pictures
the
graceful
shape
of
a
chair
she
nursed
her
appreciation
of
these
joys
resisted
the
ingress
of
familiarity
sought
daily
for
novel
aspects
of
things
become
intimately
known
she
rose
at
early
hours
that
she
might
have
the
garden
to
herself
in
all
its
freshness
she
loved
to
look
from
her
window
into
the
calm
depth
of
the
summer
midnight
in
this
way
she
brought
into
consciousness
the
craving
of
her
soul
made
the
pursuit
of
beauty
a
religion
grew
to
welcome
the
perception
of
new
meaning
in
beautiful
things
with
a
spiritual
delight
this
was
the
secret
of
her
life
which
she
guarded
so
jealously
which
she
feared
even
by
chance
to
betray
in
the
phrasings
of
common
intercourse
wilfrid
had
divined
it
and
it
was
the
secret
influence
of
this
sympathy
that
had
led
her
to
such
unwonted
frankness
in
their
latest
conversation
rossall
had
spoken
to
her
of
beatrice
redwing
delightful
singing
and
had
asked
her
to
come
to
the
during
the
evening
having
declined
the
afternoon
drive
emily
did
not
feel
able
to
neglect
this
other
invitation
the
day
had
become
sultry
towards
its
close
when
she
joined
the
company
about
nine
she
found
beatrice
with
rossall
sitting
in
the
dusk
by
the
open
french
windows
athel
in
a
chair
just
outside
and
wilfrid
standing
by
him
the
latter
pair
smoking
the
sky
beyond
the
line
of
dark
greenery
was
still
warm
with
of
sunset
emily
quietly
sought
a
chair
near
rossall
from
whom
she
received
a
kind
look
athel
was
relating
a
story
of
his
early
wanderings
in
egypt
with
a
leisurely
gusto
an
effective
minuteness
of
picturing
the
result
of
frequent
repetition
at
the
points
of
significance
he
would
pause
for
a
moment
or
two
and
puff
life
into
his
cigar
his
anecdotes
were
seldom
remarkable
but
they
derived
interest
from
the
enjoyment
with
which
he
told
them
they
impressed
one
with
a
sense
of
mental
satisfaction
of
physical
robustness
held
in
reserve
of
life
content
among
the
good
things
of
the
world
we
have
lights
rossall
asked
when
the
story
at
length
came
to
an
end
us
something
first
said
beatrice
end
of
twilight
is
so
pleasant
rossall
went
to
the
piano
upon
which
still
fell
a
glimmer
from
another
window
and
filled
the
room
with
harmony
suiting
the
hour
wilfrid
had
come
in
and
seated
himself
on
a
couch
in
a
dark
corner
his
father
paced
up
and
down
the
grass
emily
watched
the
first
faint
gleam
of
stars
in
the
upper
air
then
lamps
and
candles
were
brought
in
beatrice
was
seen
to
be
dressed
in
dark
blue
her
hair
richly
attired
a
jewelled
cross
below
her
throat
her
bosom
and
arms
radiant
in
bare
loveliness
emily
at
the
moment
that
she
regarded
her
found
herself
also
observed
her
own
dress
was
of
warm
grey
perfectly
simple
with
a
little
lace
at
the
neck
and
wrists
beatrice
averted
her
eyes
quickly
and
made
some
laughing
remark
to
athel
know
you
always
object
to
sing
without
some
musical
preparation
said
rossall
as
she
took
a
seat
by
the
girl
side
wonder
whether
we
ought
to
close
the
windows
are
you
afraid
of
the
air
leave
them
open
beatrice
replied
is
so
close
her
cheeks
had
a
higher
colour
than
usual
she
lay
back
in
the
chair
with
face
turned
upwards
her
eyes
dreaming
are
tired
i
am
afraid
rossall
said
spite
of
your
sleep
in
the
hammock
the
first
day
in
the
country
always
tires
me
dreadfully
i
suppose
i
am
a
little
murmured
beatrice
too
tired
i
hope
to
sing
said
wilfrid
coming
from
his
couch
in
the
corner
to
a
nearer
seat
his
way
of
speaking
was
not
wholly
natural
like
his
attitude
it
had
something
constrained
he
seemed
to
be
discharging
a
duty
the
selfishness
of
youth
remarked
athel
i
dare
say
has
its
selfishness
too
in
the
present
instance
was
rossall
rejoinder
whom
does
that
refer
questioned
her
brother
jocosely
beatrice
turned
her
head
suddenly
towards
emily
i
sing
miss
hood
she
asked
with
a
touch
of
her
manner
though
the
playfulness
of
her
words
rang
strangely
will
give
me
much
pleasure
to
hear
you
was
the
sober
reply
coming
after
an
instant
of
embarrassment
beatrice
rose
her
movement
across
the
room
had
a
union
of
conscious
stateliness
and
virgin
grace
which
became
her
style
of
beauty
it
was
in
itself
the
introduction
to
fine
music
rossall
went
to
accompany
choice
was
made
of
a
solo
from
an
oratorio
beatrice
never
sang
trivialities
of
the
day
a
noteworthy
variance
from
her
habits
in
other
things
in
a
little
while
wilfrid
stirred
to
enable
himself
to
see
emily
face
it
showed
deep
feeling
and
indeed
it
was
impossible
to
hear
that
voice
and
remain
unmoved
its
sweetness
its
force
its
skill
were
alike
admirable
beatrice
conversing
was
quite
other
than
beatrice
when
she
sang
music
was
her
mode
of
from
the
first
sustained
note
it
was
felt
that
a
difficulty
of
expression
had
been
overcome
and
that
she
was
saying
things
which
at
other
times
she
could
not
disclosing
motives
which
as
a
rule
the
complexities
of
her
character
covered
and
concealed
which
were
not
clear
to
her
own
consciousness
till
the
divine
impulse
gave
them
form
it
was
no
shallow
nature
that
could
pour
forth
this
flood
of
harmony
the
mere
gift
of
a
splendid
voice
wrought
to
whatever
degree
of
perfection
would
not
invest
with
this
rare
power
in
technical
qualities
she
might
have
much
still
to
learn
but
the
passionate
poetry
of
her
notes
was
what
no
training
could
have
developed
and
it
would
never
evince
itself
with
more
impressiveness
than
it
seemed
frivolous
to
speak
thanks
wilfrid
gazed
out
into
the
dark
of
the
garden
emily
kept
her
eyes
bent
downward
she
heard
the
rustle
of
beatrice
dress
near
her
athel
began
to
speak
of
the
piece
the
sound
of
beatrice
voice
replying
caused
emily
at
length
to
look
up
and
she
met
the
dark
eyes
still
large
with
the
joy
of
song
her
own
gaze
had
a
beautiful
solemnity
a
devout
admiration
of
which
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
the
genuineness
beatrice
observing
it
smiled
very
slightly
before
turning
away
again
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
emily
withdrew
rossall
played
a
little
and
talk
of
an
idle
kind
followed
wilfrid
was
not
disposed
to
take
his
usual
part
in
conversation
and
his
casual
remarks
were
scarcely
ever
addressed
to
beatrice
presently
rossall
wished
to
refer
to
the
which
contained
a
criticism
of
a
new
pianist
of
whom
there
was
much
talk
just
then
you
had
it
wilf
athel
asked
after
turning
over
a
heap
of
papers
in
vain
the
spectator
wilfrid
replied
rousing
himself
from
absentness
i
had
it
in
the
just
before
dinner
i
believe
i
left
it
there
shall
i
fetch
it
would
serve
you
right
if
i
said
yes
admonished
rossall
the
first
place
you
had
no
business
to
be
reading
it
will
go
wilfrid
said
rising
with
an
effort
no
it
will
do
as
well
get
it
now
he
said
indifferently
and
went
out
by
the
window
that
part
of
the
garden
through
which
he
walked
lay
in
the
shadow
of
the
house
the
sky
was
full
of
moonlight
but
the
moon
itself
was
still
low
a
pathway
between
laurels
led
to
the
just
short
of
the
little
building
he
passed
the
edge
of
shade
and
before
entering
turned
to
view
the
bright
crescent
as
it
hung
just
above
the
gazing
at
the
forms
of
silvered
cloud
floating
on
blue
depths
he
heard
a
movement
immediately
behind
him
he
turned
to
behold
emily
standing
in
the
doorway
the
moon
rays
shone
full
upon
her
a
light
shawl
which
seemed
to
have
covered
her
head
had
slipped
down
to
her
shoulders
and
one
end
was
held
in
a
hand
passed
over
her
breast
there
was
something
in
the
attitude
which
strikingly
became
her
her
slight
figure
looked
both
graceful
and
dignified
the
marble
hue
of
her
face
thus
gleamed
upon
added
to
the
statuesque
effect
her
eyes
had
a
startled
look
their
lids
drooped
as
wilfrid
regarded
her
have
been
sitting
here
since
you
left
us
he
asked
in
a
voice
attuned
to
the
night
hush
was
tempted
to
come
out
the
night
is
so
beautiful
is
he
uttered
the
assent
mechanically
his
eyes
like
hers
had
fallen
but
he
raised
them
again
to
her
face
it
seemed
to
him
in
this
moment
the
perfect
type
of
spiritual
beauty
the
brow
so
broad
and
pure
the
eyes
in
their
maidenly
reserve
the
lips
full
firm
of
infinite
refinement
and
sweetness
he
felt
abashed
before
her
as
he
had
never
done
they
had
stood
thus
but
a
moment
or
two
yet
it
seemed
long
to
both
emily
stepped
from
the
wooden
threshold
on
to
the
grass
wants
the
spectator
he
said
hurriedly
believe
i
left
it
here
it
is
on
the
table
with
a
perfectly
natural
impulse
she
quickly
the
house
to
reach
the
paper
she
had
seen
only
a
minute
ago
without
reflection
stifling
his
thought
he
stepped
after
her
the
shadow
made
her
turn
rapidly
a
shimmer
of
silver
light
through
the
still
touched
her
features
her
lips
were
parted
as
if
in
fear
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
spoken
the
name
upon
his
tongue
a
name
he
had
said
low
to
himself
often
and
yesterday
was
born
of
the
throe
which
made
of
his
veins
the
passion
which
at
the
instant
seized
imperiously
upon
his
being
she
could
not
see
his
face
and
hers
to
him
was
a
glory
yet
each
knew
the
wild
gaze
the
all
but
terror
in
the
other
eyes
that
anguish
which
indicates
a
supreme
moment
in
life
a
of
fate
she
had
no
voice
wilfrid
words
at
length
made
way
impetuously
thought
i
could
wait
longer
and
try
in
the
meanwhile
to
win
your
kind
thoughts
for
me
but
i
dare
not
part
from
you
for
so
long
leaving
it
a
mere
chance
that
you
will
come
back
i
must
say
to
you
what
it
means
the
hope
of
seeing
you
again
all
the
other
desires
of
my
life
are
lost
in
that
you
are
my
true
self
for
which
i
shall
seek
in
vain
whilst
i
am
away
from
you
can
you
give
me
anything
a
promise
of
kind
thought
a
hope
to
live
upon
till
i
see
you
can
not
come
back
but
for
the
intense
stillness
he
could
not
have
caught
the
words
they
were
sighed
rather
than
spoken
i
have
said
this
emily
he
saw
the
white
shape
of
her
hand
resting
upon
the
table
and
held
it
in
his
own
that
exquisite
hand
which
he
had
so
often
longed
to
touch
how
cold
it
was
yet
how
soft
living
she
made
no
effort
to
draw
it
away
can
not
say
now
what
i
wish
to
he
spoke
hurriedly
must
see
you
you
will
not
refuse
i
see
you
you
are
often
out
very
early
i
shall
be
at
the
hollow
where
we
talked
yesterday
early
at
seven
you
will
come
if
the
morning
is
not
fine
then
the
day
after
emily
you
will
meet
me
will
meet
you
he
touched
her
fingers
with
his
lips
took
the
paper
and
hastened
back
to
the
house
his
absence
had
not
seemed
long
it
was
only
of
five
minutes
reaching
the
open
windows
he
did
not
enter
at
once
but
stood
there
and
called
to
those
within
to
come
and
admire
the
night
he
felt
his
face
hot
and
flushed
is
there
remarkable
about
the
night
asked
athel
sauntering
forwards
and
look
at
this
glorious
moon
miss
redwing
wilfrid
exclaimed
once
more
with
the
natural
friendliness
of
his
habitual
tone
to
her
seems
to
have
put
you
into
excellent
spirits
remarked
rossall
as
followed
by
beatrice
she
approached
the
window
you
found
the
spectator
that
the
point
wilfrid
continued
speaking
in
a
raised
voice
for
it
was
just
possible
he
thought
that
emily
might
come
this
way
round
to
enter
and
he
wished
her
to
be
apprised
of
their
presence
all
went
back
into
the
room
after
a
few
moments
and
as
the
air
had
grown
cooler
the
windows
were
closed
as
wilfrid
seated
himself
in
a
dusky
part
of
the
room
he
noticed
that
beatrice
was
regarding
him
steadily
she
had
not
spoken
since
his
return
and
did
not
do
so
till
she
presently
rose
to
say
to
wilfrid
she
used
no
form
of
words
merely
giving
him
her
hand
that
other
had
been
so
cold
how
hot
this
was
she
laughed
as
she
turned
from
him
is
the
source
of
amusement
inquired
athel
who
was
standing
by
with
his
hands
upon
his
hips
i
do
know
returned
beatrice
laughing
again
slightly
sometimes
laugh
without
cause
emily
had
passed
upstairs
and
gone
to
her
bedroom
but
a
moment
before
treading
with
quick
soundless
steps
when
wilfrid
left
her
in
the
she
stood
unmoving
and
only
after
a
minute
or
two
changed
her
attitude
by
putting
her
palms
against
her
face
as
if
in
the
gloom
she
found
too
much
light
it
was
a
sensation
of
shame
which
came
upon
her
a
tremor
of
maidenhood
in
swift
instant
by
instant
all
that
had
just
passed
had
she
in
any
way
aided
in
bringing
about
that
confession
had
she
done
anything
made
a
motion
uttered
a
tone
which
broke
away
the
barrier
between
herself
and
him
when
she
could
recover
disembarrass
herself
of
the
phantom
moments
which
would
not
fleet
with
the
rest
of
time
it
was
scarcely
joy
which
she
read
in
her
heart
apprehension
dismay
lack
of
courage
to
look
forward
beyond
this
night
these
oppressed
her
then
close
upon
the
haunting
reality
of
his
voice
his
touch
came
inability
to
believe
what
had
happened
had
a
transient
dreamful
slumber
crept
upon
her
as
she
sat
here
alone
so
quickly
had
the
world
suffered
so
magical
the
whelming
of
old
days
in
a
new
order
so
complete
the
change
in
herself
one
word
she
knew
which
had
power
from
eternity
to
do
these
things
and
that
word
neither
he
nor
she
had
uttered
but
there
was
no
need
when
the
night
spoke
it
in
every
beat
of
time
fearful
of
being
seen
she
at
length
ventured
to
return
to
the
house
moonlight
streamed
full
upon
her
bed
it
would
have
irked
her
as
yet
to
take
off
her
clothes
she
lay
in
the
radiance
which
seemed
to
touch
her
with
warm
influences
and
let
her
eyes
rest
upon
the
source
of
light
then
at
length
joy
came
and
throned
in
her
heart
joy
that
would
mate
with
no
anxious
thought
no
tremulous
brooding
this
was
night
there
might
be
other
happy
beings
in
the
world
to
whom
it
was
also
the
beginning
of
new
life
but
in
name
was
its
consecration
hers
the
supremacy
of
blessedness
let
the
morrow
wait
on
the
hour
of
waking
if
indeed
sleep
would
ever
come
this
moment
the
sacred
was
all
that
she
could
comprehend
she
undressed
at
length
and
even
slept
fitfully
always
to
start
into
wakefulness
with
a
sense
of
something
to
be
thought
upon
to
be
realised
to
be
done
the
weariness
of
excitement
perturbed
her
joy
the
meeting
which
was
to
take
place
in
a
few
hours
became
a
nervous
preoccupation
the
moonlight
had
died
away
the
cold
light
of
dawn
began
to
make
objects
in
the
room
distinct
was
it
good
to
have
consented
so
readily
to
meet
him
nay
but
no
choice
had
been
left
her
his
eagerness
would
take
no
refusal
and
it
was
impossible
for
things
to
remain
as
they
were
without
calmer
talk
between
them
it
was
her
resource
to
remember
his
energetic
will
his
force
of
character
the
happiness
of
passively
submitting
to
what
he
might
dictate
sure
of
his
scrupulous
honour
his
high
ideal
could
she
indeed
have
borne
to
go
into
exile
from
his
presence
without
a
hope
that
this
the
noblest
and
most
aspiring
life
that
had
ever
approached
her
might
be
something
more
than
a
star
to
worship
if
wealth
comes
we
wonder
how
we
drew
breath
in
poverty
yet
we
lived
and
should
have
lived
on
let
the
gods
be
thanked
whom
it
pleases
to
clothe
the
soul
with
joy
which
is
superfluous
to
bare
existence
might
she
not
now
hallow
herself
to
be
a
true
priestess
of
beauty
would
not
life
be
vivid
with
new
powers
and
possibilities
even
as
that
heaven
was
robing
itself
in
glory
of
sunrise
with
warmth
and
hue
which
strengthened
her
again
to
overcome
anxieties
was
he
waking
was
he
impatient
for
the
hour
of
his
meeting
with
her
she
would
stand
face
to
face
with
him
in
the
full
sunlight
this
time
but
with
what
deep
humility
should
she
be
able
to
find
words
she
had
scarcely
spoken
to
him
ever
as
yet
and
now
there
was
more
to
say
than
hours
of
solitude
would
leave
time
for
she
knew
not
whether
to
bid
the
sun
linger
or
speed
there
was
nothing
unusual
in
her
rising
and
going
forth
early
though
perhaps
she
had
never
issued
from
the
house
quite
so
early
as
this
morning
it
was
not
yet
six
when
she
gently
closed
the
behind
her
and
walked
along
the
road
which
led
on
to
the
common
the
sun
had
already
warmed
the
world
and
the
sheen
of
earth
and
heaven
was
at
its
brightest
the
wind
sweeping
from
the
downs
was
like
the
breath
of
creation
giving
life
to
forms
of
faultless
beauty
emily
heart
lacked
no
morning
hymn
every
sense
revelled
in
that
pure
joy
which
is
the
poetry
of
praise
she
wished
it
had
been
near
the
hour
of
meeting
yet
again
was
glad
to
have
time
to
prepare
herself
walking
she
drank
in
the
loveliness
about
her
marked
the
forms
of
trees
the
light
and
shade
of
heavy
leafage
the
blendings
of
colour
by
the
roadside
the
grace
of
remote
distances
all
these
things
she
was
making
part
of
herself
that
in
memory
they
might
be
a
joy
for
ever
it
is
the
art
of
life
to
take
each
moment
of
mental
joy
of
spiritual
openness
as
though
it
would
never
be
repeated
to
cling
to
it
as
a
pearl
of
great
price
to
exhaust
its
possibilities
of
sensation
at
the
best
such
moments
will
be
few
amid
the
fateful
succession
of
common
cares
of
lassitudes
of
disillusions
emily
had
gone
deep
enough
in
thought
already
to
understand
this
in
her
rapture
there
was
no
want
of
discerning
consciousness
if
this
morning
were
to
be
unique
in
her
life
she
would
have
gained
from
it
all
that
it
had
to
give
those
subtle
fears
spiritual
misgivings
which
lurked
behind
her
perceptions
would
again
have
their
day
for
it
was
only
by
striving
that
she
had
attained
her
present
modes
of
thought
her
nature
concealed
a
darker
strain
an
instinct
of
asceticism
which
had
now
and
again
predominated
especially
in
the
period
of
her
transition
to
womanhood
when
the
material
conditions
of
her
life
were
sad
and
of
little
hope
it
was
no
spirit
of
unreflective
joy
that
now
dwelt
within
her
but
the
more
human
happiness
extorted
from
powers
which
only
yield
to
striving
hitherto
her
morning
had
been
but
cold
and
grey
she
had
trained
herself
to
expect
no
breaking
forth
of
gleams
from
the
sober
sky
this
sudden
splendour
might
be
transitory
but
who
was
that
already
standing
by
the
hollow
was
it
likely
that
he
would
be
later
than
she
at
the
place
of
meeting
emily
stood
with
a
shock
of
life
at
the
gates
of
her
heart
she
tried
to
keep
her
eyes
raised
to
his
as
she
approached
slowly
he
with
more
speed
would
she
not
after
all
find
voice
for
the
things
she
had
to
say
wilfrid
came
to
her
with
bare
head
and
took
her
hand
no
more
than
took
her
hand
for
he
was
in
awe
of
the
solemn
beauty
of
her
countenance
thought
i
should
keep
you
waiting
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
trembling
with
joy
have
watched
the
sun
rise
door
had
not
been
opened
window
is
not
high
above
the
ground
he
answered
with
an
uncertain
laugh
they
walked
side
by
side
over
the
heather
towards
the
beginning
of
a
wood
young
fir
trees
mingling
with
gorse
and
bracken
beyond
was
the
dense
foliage
of
older
growths
he
had
again
taken
one
of
her
hands
and
so
led
her
on
she
was
able
to
look
into
his
face
for
a
moment
but
the
moving
of
her
lips
gave
no
sound
could
not
sleep
he
went
on
i
read
of
you
till
dawn
in
the
knightes
tale
it
is
a
name
i
have
always
loved
sweet
musical
but
of
deep
meaning
will
you
not
let
me
hear
you
speak
emily
she
uttered
a
few
timid
words
then
they
passed
on
in
silence
till
the
wood
was
all
about
them
i
tell
you
the
plan
which
i
have
made
in
the
night
he
said
as
they
stood
on
a
spot
of
smooth
turf
netted
with
sunlight
leave
us
in
two
days
before
we
start
for
london
i
shall
speak
with
my
father
and
tell
him
what
has
come
about
you
remember
what
i
was
saying
about
him
the
day
before
yesterday
perhaps
it
was
with
a
of
this
so
daring
i
was
you
see
i
have
no
fear
of
his
kindness
his
good
sense
at
the
same
time
it
is
right
you
should
know
that
my
independence
is
assured
my
grandfather
left
me
far
more
than
enough
for
mere
needs
by
the
summer
of
next
year
i
shall
be
free
of
oxford
i
care
little
now
for
such
honours
as
those
you
have
honoured
me
more
than
any
other
voice
has
power
to
do
but
my
father
would
be
disappointed
if
i
did
not
go
on
to
the
end
and
do
something
of
what
is
expected
now
you
must
tell
me
freely
is
there
absolute
necessity
for
your
maintaining
yourself
in
the
meanwhile
for
your
leaving
home
is
she
replied
will
you
continue
to
teach
the
children
as
usual
she
was
touched
with
apprehension
i
would
do
so
but
is
it
possible
would
you
conceal
from
rossall
wilfrid
mused
meant
to
but
your
instincts
are
truer
than
mine
say
what
you
think
i
believe
my
father
would
countenance
it
for
it
involves
no
real
deceit
you
wish
it
emily
said
after
a
silence
in
a
low
voice
my
aunt
pursued
wilfrid
have
just
this
degree
of
doubt
she
might
make
difficulties
her
ways
of
thinking
differ
often
from
ours
yet
it
is
far
better
that
you
should
continue
to
live
with
us
i
myself
shall
scarcely
ever
be
at
home
it
will
not
be
as
if
i
dwelt
under
the
roof
i
will
make
my
visits
as
short
as
possible
not
to
trouble
you
i
could
not
let
you
go
to
the
house
of
other
people
you
to
lack
consideration
perhaps
to
meet
unkindness
rather
than
that
you
shall
stay
in
your
own
home
or
i
will
not
return
to
oxford
at
all
emily
stood
in
anxious
thought
he
drew
a
step
nearer
to
her
seemed
about
to
draw
nearer
still
but
checked
himself
as
she
looked
up
fear
we
must
not
do
that
she
said
rossall
would
not
forgive
me
woman
judgment
of
woman
and
worth
much
more
than
wilfrid
rough
and
ready
scheming
wilfrid
smiled
she
also
shall
know
he
exclaimed
shall
take
nay
view
of
this
i
will
not
be
gainsaid
what
is
there
in
the
plan
that
common
sense
can
object
to
your
position
is
not
that
of
a
servant
you
are
from
the
first
our
friend
you
honour
us
by
the
aid
you
give
efficient
as
few
could
make
it
yes
there
shall
be
no
concealment
far
better
so
have
no
fear
of
the
views
they
will
take
he
said
with
characteristic
decision
they
are
unreasonable
absurd
our
course
is
plain
enough
you
will
be
my
wife
when
i
ask
you
to
emily
she
faltered
and
held
her
hand
to
him
it
worth
while
to
go
hack
to
oxford
he
mused
caressing
the
fingers
he
had
kissed
yes
you
must
emily
urged
with
a
sort
of
fear
in
her
sudden
courage
must
not
disappoint
them
your
father
your
friends
fair
wise
one
he
murmured
gazing
rapturously
at
her
emily
think
what
our
life
will
be
shall
we
not
drain
the
world
of
its
wisdom
youth
of
its
delight
hand
in
hand
one
heart
one
brain
what
shall
escape
us
it
was
you
i
needed
to
give
completeness
to
my
thought
and
desire
the
old
dream
the
eternal
fancy
this
one
this
and
no
other
chosen
from
out
the
myriads
of
human
souls
individuality
the
servant
of
passion
mysteries
read
undoubtingly
with
the
eye
of
longing
bead
perhaps
so
truly
who
knows
she
came
nearer
imperceptibly
her
raised
face
aglow
like
the
morning
you
believe
you
know
that
i
love
you
the
last
word
breathed
out
in
the
touching
of
lips
with
lips
what
could
he
reply
save
those
old
simple
words
of
tenderness
that
small
vocabulary
of
love
common
to
child
and
man
the
goddess
that
made
herself
woman
for
his
sake
see
did
he
not
hold
her
clasped
to
him
but
she
was
mute
again
the
birds
sang
so
loudly
round
about
them
uttered
their
hearts
so
easily
but
emily
could
only
speak
through
silence
and
afterwards
she
knew
there
was
so
much
she
should
have
said
what
matter
one
can
not
find
tongue
upon
the
threshold
of
the
holy
of
holies
chapter
iv
a
conflict
of
opinions
beatrice
redwing
visit
only
extended
over
the
second
day
and
during
that
there
was
little
if
any
separate
conversation
between
her
and
wilfrid
the
change
in
her
from
the
free
gaiety
and
restfulness
of
the
morning
of
her
arrival
could
not
escape
notice
though
she
affected
a
continuance
of
the
bright
mood
athel
and
his
sister
both
observed
her
real
preoccupation
as
if
of
trouble
and
mentally
attributed
it
to
something
that
had
passed
during
the
afternoon
ride
rossall
did
not
look
for
confidences
beatrice
would
gossip
freely
enough
of
trivial
experiences
or
of
the
details
of
faith
and
ritual
but
the
innermost
veil
of
her
heart
was
never
raised
all
her
friends
felt
that
though
they
could
not
easily
have
explained
in
what
way
they
became
conscious
of
this
reserve
she
seemed
so
thoroughly
open
not
to
say
so
shallow
she
left
the
firs
to
return
to
town
and
thence
in
a
week
or
two
went
to
cowes
a
favourite
abode
of
her
mother
the
next
day
emily
also
left
journeying
to
london
on
her
way
to
the
north
wilfrid
and
she
had
no
second
meeting
their
parting
was
formal
in
the
family
circle
athel
displayed
even
more
than
his
usual
urbanity
rossall
was
genuinely
gracious
the
twins
made
many
promises
to
write
from
switzerland
emily
was
but
wilfrid
read
in
her
face
that
she
was
going
through
an
ordeal
he
felt
the
folly
of
his
first
proposal
that
she
should
play
a
part
before
rossall
through
the
winter
months
he
decided
moreover
that
no
time
should
be
lost
in
making
the
necessary
disclosure
to
his
father
naturally
it
would
be
an
anxious
time
with
emily
till
she
had
news
from
him
she
had
asked
him
to
direct
letters
to
the
dunfield
post
office
not
to
her
home
it
was
better
so
for
the
present
wilfrid
though
anything
but
weakly
nervous
was
impatient
of
suspense
and
in
face
of
a
situation
like
the
present
suffered
from
the
excitability
of
an
imaginative
temperament
he
had
by
no
means
yet
outgrown
the
mood
which
when
he
was
a
boy
made
the
anticipation
of
any
delight
a
physical
illness
in
an
essentially
feeble
nature
this
extreme
sensibility
is
fatal
to
sane
achievement
in
wilfrid
it
merely
enforced
the
vigour
of
his
will
as
a
child
he
used
to
exclaim
that
he
not
wait
at
present
he
was
apt
to
say
that
he
would
not
he
did
not
in
very
truth
anticipate
difficulties
with
his
father
his
conviction
of
the
latter
reasonableness
being
strongly
supported
by
immense
confidence
in
his
own
powers
of
putting
a
case
incontrovertibly
as
he
had
said
to
emily
he
could
scarcely
allow
that
deep
affection
for
his
father
dwelt
within
him
nor
did
the
nature
of
the
case
permit
him
to
feel
exactly
reverent
these
stronger
emotions
were
reserved
for
the
memory
of
the
parent
who
was
long
dead
he
thought
of
his
father
with
warm
friendliness
that
temper
which
is
consistent
with
clear
perception
of
faults
and
foibles
which
makes
of
them
indeed
an
occasion
for
the
added
kindliness
of
indulgence
and
which
on
the
other
hand
leaves
perfect
freedom
in
judgment
and
action
we
know
that
it
is
for
the
most
part
a
misfortune
to
be
the
son
of
a
really
great
man
and
for
the
reason
that
nature
so
indifferent
to
the
individual
makes
the
of
each
generation
mainly
consist
in
early
predominance
over
the
generation
which
gave
it
birth
wilfrid
suffered
no
such
exceptional
hardship
at
he
felt
himself
essentially
his
superior
he
would
not
have
exposed
the
fact
thus
crudely
for
he
was
susceptible
to
the
comely
order
of
things
the
fact
was
a
fact
and
nature
not
he
was
responsible
for
it
that
and
the
circumstance
of
his
material
independence
would
necessarily
keep
the
ensuing
interview
well
within
the
limits
of
urbane
comedy
the
young
man
smiled
already
at
the
suggested
comparison
with
his
father
own
choice
in
matrimony
wilfrid
had
never
had
the
details
of
that
story
avowedly
represented
to
him
but
it
was
inevitable
that
he
should
have
learnt
enough
to
enable
him
to
reconstruct
them
with
tolerable
accuracy
emily
was
gone
long
before
the
hour
of
luncheon
after
that
meal
athel
lit
a
cigar
and
went
to
a
favourite
seat
in
the
garden
rossall
was
going
with
the
twins
to
make
a
farewell
call
on
neighbouring
friends
as
soon
as
the
carriage
had
left
the
house
wilfrid
sought
his
father
who
was
amusing
himself
with
a
review
thought
you
would
have
gone
with
your
aunt
athel
remarked
after
a
glance
to
see
who
was
approaching
him
had
an
object
in
remaining
behind
wilfrid
returned
composedly
seating
himself
on
a
which
he
had
brought
out
wished
to
talk
over
with
you
a
matter
of
some
importance
athel
stroked
his
chin
and
smiled
a
little
it
occurred
to
him
at
once
that
something
relative
to
beatrice
was
about
to
be
disclosed
is
it
he
added
throwing
one
leg
over
the
other
and
letting
the
review
lie
open
on
his
lap
concerns
miss
hood
pursued
the
other
assuming
the
same
attitude
save
that
he
had
nothing
to
lean
hack
against
day
or
two
ago
i
asked
her
to
engage
herself
to
me
and
she
consented
perhaps
this
was
the
simplest
way
of
putting
it
wilfrid
could
not
utter
the
words
with
complete
calmness
his
hands
had
begun
to
tremble
a
little
and
his
temples
were
hot
by
an
effort
he
kept
his
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
his
father
face
and
what
he
saw
there
did
not
supply
encouragement
to
proceed
in
the
genial
tone
with
which
he
had
begun
athel
frowned
not
angrily
but
as
if
not
quite
able
to
grasp
what
had
been
told
him
he
had
cast
his
eyes
down
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
have
chosen
the
earliest
moment
for
telling
you
of
this
wilfrid
continued
rather
hurriedly
was
of
course
better
to
leave
it
till
miss
hood
had
gone
on
the
father
face
displeasure
had
succeeded
to
mere
astonishment
could
have
told
me
few
things
that
i
should
be
so
sorry
to
hear
were
his
first
words
delivered
in
an
undertone
and
with
grave
precision
that
does
not
express
your
better
thought
said
wilfrid
to
whom
a
hint
of
opposition
at
once
gave
the
firmness
he
had
lacked
expresses
my
very
natural
thought
in
the
first
place
it
is
not
pleasant
to
know
that
clandestine
proceedings
of
this
kind
have
been
going
on
under
my
roof
i
have
no
wish
to
say
anything
disrespectful
of
miss
hood
but
i
am
disposed
to
think
that
she
has
mistaken
her
vocation
such
talents
for
dissimulation
would
surely
have
pointed
to
athel
had
two
ways
of
expressing
displeasure
where
ceremony
was
wholly
unnecessary
he
gave
vent
to
his
feelings
in
an
outburst
of
hearty
english
wrath
not
coarsely
for
his
instincts
were
invariably
those
of
a
gentleman
but
in
the
cultivated
autocratic
tone
an
offending
groom
for
instance
did
not
care
to
incur
reproof
a
second
time
where
this
mode
of
utterance
was
out
of
place
he
was
apt
to
have
recourse
to
a
somewhat
too
elaborate
irony
to
involve
himself
in
phrases
which
ultimately
led
to
awkward
hesitations
with
the
effect
that
he
grew
more
heated
by
embarrassment
had
he
been
allowed
to
proceed
he
would
at
present
have
illustrated
this
failing
for
he
had
begun
with
extreme
deliberation
smoothing
the
open
pages
with
his
right
hand
rounding
his
words
reddening
a
little
in
the
face
but
wilfrid
interposed
must
not
let
you
speak
or
think
of
miss
hood
so
mistakenly
he
said
firmly
but
without
unbecoming
could
not
possibly
have
behaved
with
more
reserve
to
me
than
she
did
until
three
days
ago
i
myself
gave
a
new
colour
to
our
relations
the
outward
propriety
which
you
admit
has
been
perfectly
genuine
if
there
is
any
blame
in
the
matter
and
how
can
there
be
any
it
rests
solely
upon
me
i
dare
say
you
remember
my
going
out
to
fetch
the
spectator
after
miss
redwing
had
been
singing
to
us
by
chance
i
met
miss
hood
in
the
garden
i
was
led
to
say
something
to
her
which
made
a
longer
interview
inevitable
she
consented
to
meet
me
on
the
common
before
breakfast
the
following
morning
these
are
the
only
two
occasions
which
can
be
called
clandestine
if
she
has
disguised
herself
since
then
how
could
she
have
behaved
otherwise
disguise
is
too
strong
a
word
she
has
merely
kept
silence
i
need
not
inquire
whether
you
fully
believe
what
i
say
you
say
i
believe
as
a
matter
of
course
replied
athel
who
had
drummed
with
his
fingers
as
he
listened
impatiently
can
scarcely
alter
my
view
of
the
position
of
things
had
you
come
to
me
before
offering
yourself
to
this
young
lady
and
done
me
the
honour
of
asking
my
advice
i
should
in
all
probability
have
had
a
rather
strong
opinion
to
express
as
it
is
i
do
see
that
there
is
anything
left
to
be
said
would
your
opinion
have
been
wilfrid
asked
that
for
an
idle
fancy
the
unfortunate
result
of
unoccupied
days
you
were
about
to
take
a
step
which
would
assuredly
lead
to
regret
at
least
very
probably
to
more
active
repentance
in
fact
i
should
have
warned
you
not
to
spoil
your
life
in
its
commencement
think
father
that
you
would
have
spoken
with
too
little
knowledge
of
the
case
you
can
scarcely
know
miss
hood
as
i
do
i
have
studied
her
since
we
came
here
and
with
well
with
these
results
athel
looked
up
with
grave
sadness
this
is
a
deeply
unfortunate
thing
my
boy
i
grieve
over
it
more
than
i
can
tell
you
i
am
terribly
disappointed
your
position
and
your
hopes
pointed
to
very
different
things
you
have
surprised
me
too
i
thought
your
mind
was
already
made
up
in
quite
a
different
quarter
refer
to
miss
redwing
have
indeed
been
mistaken
it
was
impossible
that
i
should
think
of
her
as
a
wife
i
must
have
sympathy
intellectual
and
moral
with
her
i
have
none
we
can
not
talk
without
flagrant
differences
differences
of
a
serious
a
radical
nature
be
assured
that
such
a
thought
as
this
never
occurred
to
miss
redwing
herself
her
very
last
conversation
with
me
forbids
any
such
idea
athel
still
drummed
on
the
book
seemingly
paying
little
heed
to
the
speaker
find
sympathy
in
miss
hood
he
asked
suddenly
with
a
touch
of
sarcasm
deepest
her
intellectual
tendencies
are
the
same
as
my
own
she
has
a
mind
which
it
refreshes
and
delights
me
to
discover
of
course
that
is
not
all
but
it
is
all
i
need
speak
of
i
know
that
i
have
chosen
well
and
rightly
wo
be
so
remarked
athel
still
with
subdued
sarcasm
to
hint
that
some
thought
of
me
might
have
entered
into
your
choosing
did
he
consciously
repeat
his
own
father
words
of
years
back
or
was
it
but
destiny
making
him
play
his
part
in
the
human
comedy
in
point
of
fact
perhaps
the
parallel
touched
him
at
this
point
are
old
enough
to
judge
the
affair
on
its
own
merits
my
wonder
is
that
your
judgment
has
not
been
sounder
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
a
young
lady
in
miss
hood
position
would
find
it
at
all
events
somewhat
difficult
to
be
unbiassed
in
her
assent
to
what
you
proposed
has
occurred
to
me
replied
wilfrid
more
shortly
than
hitherto
could
cast
a
shadow
of
suspicion
on
her
perfect
truth
i
beg
that
you
will
not
suggest
these
things
some
day
you
will
judge
her
with
better
knowledge
am
not
sure
of
that
was
the
rejoinder
almost
irritably
uttered
do
you
mean
by
that
father
wilfrid
asked
in
a
lower
tone
mean
wilf
that
i
am
not
yet
in
the
frame
of
mind
to
regard
the
children
governess
as
my
miss
hood
may
be
all
you
say
i
would
not
willingly
be
anything
but
scrupulously
just
the
fact
remains
that
this
is
not
the
alliance
which
it
became
you
to
make
it
is
in
a
very
pronounced
sense
marrying
beneath
you
it
is
not
easy
for
me
to
reconcile
myself
to
that
it
was
wilfrid
turn
to
keep
silence
what
became
of
his
plans
they
were
hardly
in
a
way
to
be
carried
out
as
he
had
conceived
them
a
graver
uneasiness
was
possessing
him
resolve
would
only
grow
by
opposition
but
there
was
more
of
pain
in
announcing
an
independent
course
than
he
had
foreseen
are
your
practical
proposals
his
father
inquired
his
mollified
tone
the
result
of
observing
that
he
had
made
a
certain
impression
for
he
was
distinctly
one
of
the
men
who
are
to
be
overcome
by
yielding
had
a
proposal
to
make
but
of
such
a
kind
that
it
is
hardly
worth
while
to
speak
of
it
i
shall
have
to
reflect
me
hear
what
you
were
going
to
say
there
no
harm
in
that
at
all
events
idea
was
that
with
your
consent
and
my
aunt
miss
hood
should
return
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
continue
to
teach
the
twins
till
next
summer
when
i
should
have
done
with
oxford
there
appears
to
me
to
be
nothing
irrational
or
unseemly
in
such
a
plan
if
she
were
our
cook
or
housemaid
there
might
be
reasonable
objections
as
it
is
it
would
hardly
involve
a
change
even
in
your
tone
to
her
seeing
that
you
are
in
the
habit
of
treating
her
as
a
lady
and
with
a
certain
degree
of
familiar
kindness
i
confess
i
had
anticipated
no
difficulties
we
are
not
a
household
of
bigoted
conservatives
it
is
hard
for
me
to
imagine
you
taking
any
line
but
that
of
an
enlightened
man
who
judges
all
things
from
the
standpoint
of
liberal
reflection
i
suppose
my
own
scorn
of
prejudices
is
largely
due
to
your
influence
it
is
not
easy
to
realise
our
being
in
conflict
on
any
matter
involving
calm
reasonableness
in
another
this
would
have
been
a
shrewd
speech
wilfrid
was
incapable
of
conscious
artifice
of
this
kind
this
appeal
the
very
strongest
he
could
have
made
to
his
father
was
urged
in
all
sincerity
and
derived
its
force
from
that
very
fact
he
possessed
not
a
little
of
the
persuasive
genius
which
goes
to
make
an
orator
hereafter
to
serve
him
in
fields
as
yet
undreamed
of
and
natural
endowment
guided
his
feeling
in
the
way
of
most
impressive
utterance
athel
smiled
in
spite
of
himself
what
about
your
aunt
he
asked
remember
that
it
is
only
by
chance
that
miss
hood
lives
under
my
roof
do
you
imagine
your
aunt
equally
unprejudiced
athel
was
characteristically
rather
fond
of
at
feminine
weaknesses
an
opportunity
of
the
kind
was
wont
to
mellow
his
mood
be
quite
open
in
the
matter
wilfrid
replied
will
own
that
my
first
idea
was
to
take
you
alone
into
my
confidence
to
ask
you
to
say
nothing
to
aunt
edith
miss
hood
felt
that
that
would
be
impossible
and
i
see
that
she
was
right
it
would
involve
deceit
which
it
is
not
in
her
nature
to
practise
and
miss
hood
have
discussed
us
freely
observed
the
father
with
a
return
to
his
irony
do
reply
to
that
said
wilfrid
quietly
think
you
must
give
me
credit
for
the
usual
measure
of
and
miss
hood
does
not
fall
short
of
it
the
look
which
athel
cast
at
his
son
had
in
it
something
of
pride
he
would
not
trust
himself
to
speak
immediately
do
say
he
began
presently
with
balancing
of
phrase
your
plan
is
not
on
the
face
of
it
consistent
and
reasonable
putting
aside
for
the
moment
the
wretchedly
unsatisfactory
circumstances
which
originate
it
i
suppose
it
is
the
plan
which
naturally
suggests
itself
but
of
course
in
practice
it
is
out
of
the
question
feel
sure
that
aunt
would
not
entertain
it
do
and
i
do
see
how
i
could
recommend
her
to
do
so
wilfrid
reflected
that
case
he
said
have
only
one
alternative
i
must
give
up
my
intention
of
returning
to
oxford
and
marry
before
the
end
of
the
year
the
words
had
to
his
own
ears
a
somewhat
explosive
sound
they
were
uttered
however
and
he
was
glad
of
it
a
purpose
thus
formulated
he
would
not
swerve
from
of
that
his
father
too
was
well
aware
athel
rose
from
his
seat
held
the
magazine
in
both
hands
behind
his
back
and
took
a
turn
across
a
few
yards
of
lawn
wilfrid
sat
still
leaning
forward
watching
his
father
shadow
the
shadow
approached
him
is
there
no
can
not
miss
hood
remain
at
home
for
a
while
are
you
going
to
throw
up
your
career
and
lay
in
a
stock
of
repentance
for
the
rest
of
your
life
do
think
you
quite
understand
me
father
i
contemplate
no
career
which
could
possibly
be
injured
even
by
my
immediate
marriage
if
you
mean
university
honours
i
care
nothing
about
them
i
would
go
through
the
routine
just
for
the
sake
of
completeness
it
is
her
strong
wish
that
i
should
but
my
future
most
happily
does
not
depend
on
success
of
that
kind
i
shall
live
the
life
of
a
student
my
end
will
be
and
miss
hood
is
unfortunately
not
able
to
remain
at
home
i
say
unfortunately
but
i
should
have
regarded
it
as
preferable
that
she
should
continue
in
her
position
with
us
you
and
aunt
edith
would
come
to
know
her
and
the
air
of
a
home
like
ours
would
i
believe
suit
her
better
than
that
of
her
own
there
is
nothing
in
her
work
that
might
not
be
performed
by
any
lady
do
you
know
of
her
people
except
that
her
father
has
scientific
interests
it
is
plain
enough
though
that
they
can
not
be
without
refinement
no
doubt
they
are
poor
we
hardly
consider
that
a
crime
he
rose
as
if
he
considered
the
interview
at
an
end
here
said
athel
with
a
little
bluffness
the
result
of
a
difficulty
in
making
concessions
miss
hood
returned
to
us
as
you
propose
should
you
consider
it
a
point
of
honour
to
go
on
with
your
work
at
balliol
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
to
abstain
from
communication
with
her
of
a
kind
which
would
make
things
awkward
undoubtedly
i
could
very
well
arrange
to
keep
away
from
home
entirely
in
the
interval
i
think
we
have
talked
enough
for
the
present
i
have
no
kind
of
sympathy
with
your
position
pray
understand
that
i
think
you
have
made
about
as
bad
a
mistake
as
you
could
have
done
all
the
same
i
will
speak
of
this
with
your
aunt
think
you
had
better
not
do
that
interrupted
wilfrid
mean
with
any
view
of
persuading
her
i
am
afraid
i
ca
very
well
bring
myself
to
compromises
which
involve
a
confession
of
childish
error
it
is
better
i
should
go
my
own
way
well
of
course
if
you
take
the
strictly
independent
attitude
athel
took
another
turn
on
the
lawn
his
brows
bent
it
was
the
first
time
that
there
had
ever
been
an
approach
to
serious
difference
between
himself
and
his
son
the
paternal
instinct
was
strong
in
him
and
it
was
inevitable
that
he
should
be
touched
by
sympathetic
admiration
of
his
past
self
as
revived
in
wilfrid
firm
and
dignified
bearing
he
approached
the
latter
again
to
me
in
the
study
about
ten
will
you
he
said
it
was
the
end
of
the
discussion
for
the
present
shortly
after
dinner
when
coffee
had
been
brought
to
the
wilfrid
wandered
out
to
the
emily
would
be
home
by
this
time
he
thought
of
her
deuce
of
it
is
exclaimed
athel
conversing
with
his
sister
it
so
hard
to
find
valid
objections
if
he
had
proposed
to
marry
a
barmaid
one
course
would
be
clear
but
as
it
is
rossall
had
listened
in
silence
to
a
disclosure
of
wilfrid
proceedings
in
the
commencement
her
attention
had
marked
itself
by
a
slight
elevation
of
the
brows
at
the
end
she
was
cold
and
rather
disdainful
observation
of
her
face
had
the
result
of
confirming
her
brother
in
the
apologetic
tone
he
was
annoyed
at
perceiving
that
edith
would
justify
his
prediction
am
sorry
to
hear
it
of
course
were
her
first
words
i
suppose
wilfrid
will
act
as
he
chooses
but
this
is
all
pursued
athel
laying
aside
an
affectation
of
indulgence
which
he
had
assumed
has
urged
upon
me
an
extraordinary
proposal
his
idea
is
that
miss
hood
might
continue
to
hold
her
position
here
until
he
has
taken
his
degree
am
not
surprised
you
of
course
told
him
that
such
a
thing
was
out
of
the
question
said
that
would
probably
consider
it
so
surely
do
you
hold
a
different
view
i
hold
no
views
at
all
i
am
not
sure
that
i
have
got
the
right
focus
yet
i
know
that
the
plans
of
a
lifetime
are
upset
i
ca
get
much
beyond
that
at
present
rossall
was
deeply
troubled
she
sat
with
her
eyes
drooped
her
lower
lip
drawn
in
you
refer
to
any
plan
in
particular
she
asked
next
i
suppose
i
do
am
very
very
sorry
for
beatrice
she
said
in
a
subdued
voice
think
it
will
rossall
raised
her
eyebrows
a
little
and
kept
her
air
of
pained
musing
what
is
to
be
done
resumed
her
brother
always
impatient
of
mere
negatives
has
delivered
a
sort
of
ultimatum
in
the
event
of
this
proposal
as
to
miss
hood
return
being
rejected
he
marries
at
once
then
goes
back
to
balliol
simply
abandons
his
career
rossall
smiled
it
was
not
in
woman
nature
to
be
uninterested
by
decision
such
as
this
you
despair
of
influencing
him
she
asked
he
will
not
hear
of
her
taking
another
place
in
the
interval
and
it
seems
there
are
difficulties
in
the
way
of
her
remaining
at
home
of
course
i
see
very
well
the
objections
on
the
surface
to
her
coming
back
objections
are
not
on
the
surface
at
all
they
are
fundamental
you
are
probably
not
in
a
position
to
see
the
ease
as
i
do
such
a
state
of
things
would
be
ludicrous
we
should
all
be
playing
parts
in
a
farce
he
can
not
have
made
such
a
proposal
to
her
she
would
have
shown
him
at
once
its
absurdity
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
she
acceded
to
it
said
athel
with
a
certain
triumph
over
female
infallibility
i
think
worse
of
her
than
i
did
that
all
not
at
all
sure
that
you
are
right
in
that
observed
her
brother
with
an
impartial
air
tell
me
your
serious
opinion
of
miss
hood
one
begins
naturally
with
a
suspicion
that
she
has
not
been
altogether
passive
in
this
affair
what
wilf
says
is
of
course
nothing
to
the
point
he
protests
that
her
attitude
has
been
irreproachable
in
making
assignations
for
six
in
the
morning
well
that
is
merely
granting
the
issue
you
are
a
illogical
edith
doubt
i
am
you
on
the
other
hand
seem
to
be
very
much
of
opinion
i
am
sorry
that
i
ca
do
as
you
wish
we
shall
not
gain
anything
by
giving
way
to
irritation
he
must
be
told
how
matters
stand
and
judge
for
himself
as
athel
was
speaking
wilfrid
entered
the
room
impatience
had
overcome
him
he
knew
of
course
that
a
discussion
was
in
progress
between
his
father
and
his
aunt
and
calm
waiting
upon
other
decisions
was
not
in
his
nature
he
came
forward
and
seated
himself
gather
from
your
look
aunt
he
began
when
the
others
did
not
seem
disposed
to
break
silence
you
take
my
father
view
of
what
he
has
been
telling
you
am
not
sure
what
your
father
view
is
was
rossall
reply
given
very
coldly
i
certainly
think
you
have
proposed
what
is
impossible
you
are
right
rejoined
wilfrid
to
the
surprise
of
both
plan
was
not
well
considered
pray
think
no
more
of
it
do
you
substitute
his
father
inquired
after
another
long
silence
can
not
say
he
paused
then
continued
with
some
emotion
would
gladly
have
had
your
sympathy
perhaps
i
fail
to
see
the
whole
matter
in
the
same
light
as
yourselves
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
step
i
have
taken
there
is
nothing
that
should
cause
lasting
difference
between
us
i
involve
the
family
in
no
kind
of
disgrace
that
i
suppose
you
admit
rossall
made
no
answer
athel
moved
uneasily
upon
his
chair
coughed
seemed
about
to
speak
but
in
the
end
said
nothing
am
afraid
i
shall
not
be
able
to
leave
england
with
you
continued
wilfrid
rising
that
fortunately
need
cause
no
change
in
your
plans
athel
was
annoyed
at
his
sister
behaviour
he
had
looked
to
her
for
mediation
clearly
she
would
offer
nothing
of
the
kind
she
was
wrapping
herself
in
a
cloak
of
offended
dignity
she
had
withdrawn
from
the
debate
with
me
to
my
room
he
said
moving
from
his
chair
think
it
will
be
better
to
have
no
further
discussion
wilfrid
replied
firmly
all
events
you
please
said
his
father
shortly
he
went
from
the
room
and
wilfrid
without
further
speech
to
his
aunt
presently
followed
chapter
v
the
shadow
of
home
the
house
which
was
the
end
of
emily
journey
was
situated
two
miles
outside
the
town
of
dunfield
on
the
high
road
going
southward
just
before
it
enters
upon
a
rising
tract
of
common
land
known
as
the
heath
it
was
one
of
a
row
of
dwellings
built
of
glazed
brick
each
with
a
wide
projecting
window
on
the
right
hand
of
the
front
door
and
with
a
patch
of
garden
railed
in
from
the
road
the
row
being
part
of
a
straggling
colony
which
is
called
banbrigg
immediately
opposite
these
houses
stood
an
ecclesiastical
edifice
of
depressing
appearance
wholly
without
ornament
presenting
a
corner
to
the
highway
a
for
worshippers
unable
to
go
as
far
as
dunfield
in
the
one
direction
or
the
village
of
pendal
in
the
other
scattered
about
were
old
and
new
the
former
being
cottages
of
the
poorest
and
dirtiest
kind
the
latter
brick
structures
of
the
most
unsightly
form
evidently
aiming
at
constituting
themselves
into
a
thoroughfare
and
in
point
of
fact
already
rejoicing
in
the
name
of
regent
street
there
was
a
or
rather
as
it
frankly
styled
itself
in
large
letters
on
the
window
a
and
there
were
two
or
three
places
for
the
sale
of
very
miscellaneous
articles
exhibiting
the
same
specimens
of
discouraging
stock
throughout
the
year
at
no
season
and
under
no
advantage
of
sky
was
banbrigg
a
delectable
abode
though
within
easy
reach
of
country
which
was
not
without
rural
aspects
it
was
marked
too
unmistakably
with
the
squalor
of
a
manufacturing
district
its
existence
impressed
one
as
casual
it
was
a
mere
bit
of
dunfield
got
away
from
the
main
mass
and
having
brought
its
dirt
with
it
the
stretch
of
road
between
it
and
the
bridge
by
which
the
river
was
crossed
into
dunfield
had
in
its
long
hard
ugliness
something
dispiriting
though
hedges
bordered
it
here
and
there
they
were
stunted
and
grimed
though
fields
were
seen
on
this
side
and
on
that
the
grass
had
absorbed
too
much
to
exhibit
wholesome
verdure
it
was
fed
upon
by
sheep
and
cows
seemingly
turned
in
to
be
out
of
the
way
till
needed
for
slaughter
and
by
the
sorriest
of
superannuated
horses
the
land
was
blighted
by
the
curse
of
what
we
name
using
a
word
as
ugly
as
the
thing
it
represents
industrialism
as
the
cab
brought
her
along
this
road
from
dunfield
station
emily
thought
of
the
downs
the
woodlands
the
fair
pastures
of
surrey
there
was
sorrow
at
her
heart
even
a
vague
tormenting
fear
it
would
be
hard
to
find
solace
in
banbrigg
hither
her
parents
had
come
to
live
when
she
was
thirteen
years
old
her
home
having
previously
been
in
another
and
a
larger
manufacturing
town
her
father
was
a
man
marked
for
it
pursued
him
from
his
entrance
into
the
world
and
would
inevitably
you
read
it
in
his
face
hunt
him
into
a
sad
grave
he
was
the
youngest
of
a
large
family
his
very
birth
had
been
an
added
misery
to
a
household
struggling
with
want
his
education
was
of
the
slightest
at
twelve
years
of
age
he
was
already
supporting
himself
or
one
would
say
keeping
himself
above
the
point
of
starvation
and
at
the
age
when
wilfrid
athel
is
entering
upon
life
in
the
joy
of
freedom
was
ludicrously
bankrupt
a
petty
business
he
had
established
being
sold
up
for
a
debt
something
short
of
as
many
pounds
as
he
had
years
he
drifted
into
indefinite
mercantile
clerkships
an
existence
possibly
preferable
to
that
of
the
fourth
circle
of
inferno
and
then
seemed
at
length
to
have
fallen
upon
a
piece
of
good
luck
such
as
according
to
a
maxim
of
pathetic
optimism
wherewith
he
was
wont
to
cheer
himself
must
come
to
every
man
sooner
or
later
provided
he
do
not
die
of
hunger
whilst
it
is
on
the
way
he
married
a
schoolmistress
one
miss
martin
who
was
responsible
for
the
teaching
of
some
twelve
or
fifteen
children
of
tender
age
and
who
what
was
more
owned
the
house
in
which
she
kept
school
the
result
was
that
james
hood
once
more
established
himself
in
business
or
rather
in
several
businesses
vague
indescribable
save
by
those
who
are
unhappy
enough
to
understand
such
matters
a
commission
agency
a
life
insurance
agency
and
a
fire
insurance
ditto
i
know
not
what
yet
the
semblance
of
prosperity
was
fleeting
as
if
connection
with
him
meant
failure
his
wife
school
which
she
had
not
abandoned
let
us
employ
negative
terms
in
speaking
of
this
pair
began
to
fall
off
ultimately
no
school
was
left
it
did
in
truth
appear
that
miss
martin
had
suffered
something
in
becoming
mrs
hood
at
her
marriage
she
was
fairly
in
temper
a
trifle
exigent
perhaps
sanguine
and
capable
of
exertion
she
could
not
claim
more
than
superficial
instruction
but
taught
reading
and
writing
with
the
usual
success
which
attends
teachers
of
these
elements
after
the
birth
of
her
first
child
emily
her
moral
nature
showed
an
unaccountable
weakening
the
origin
was
no
doubt
physical
but
in
we
dwell
very
much
on
the
surface
of
things
it
is
not
permitted
us
to
describe
human
nature
too
accurately
the
exigence
of
her
temper
became
something
generally
described
by
a
harsher
term
she
lost
her
interest
in
the
work
which
she
had
unwillingly
entrusted
for
a
time
to
an
assistant
she
found
the
conditions
of
her
life
hard
alas
they
grew
harder
after
emily
two
children
were
successively
born
fate
was
kind
to
them
and
neither
survived
infancy
their
mother
fell
into
fretting
into
hysteria
some
change
in
her
life
seemed
imperative
and
at
length
she
persuaded
her
husband
to
quit
the
town
in
which
they
lived
and
begin
life
anew
elsewhere
begin
life
anew
james
hood
was
forty
years
old
he
possessed
as
the
net
result
of
his
commercial
enterprises
a
capital
of
a
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
the
house
of
course
could
be
let
and
would
bring
pounds
a
year
this
it
was
resolved
to
do
he
had
had
certain
dealings
in
dunfield
and
in
dunfield
he
would
strike
his
tent
that
is
to
say
in
banbrigg
whence
he
walked
daily
to
a
little
office
in
the
town
rents
were
lower
in
banbrigg
and
it
was
beyond
the
range
of
certain
municipal
taxings
mrs
hood
possessed
still
her
somewhat
genteel
furniture
one
article
was
a
piano
and
upon
this
she
taught
emily
her
notes
it
had
been
a
fairly
good
piano
once
but
the
keys
had
become
very
loose
they
were
looser
than
ever
now
that
emily
tried
to
play
on
them
on
her
return
from
surrey
business
did
not
thrive
in
dunfield
yet
there
was
more
than
ever
need
that
it
should
for
to
neglect
emily
education
would
be
to
deal
cruelly
with
the
child
she
would
have
nothing
else
to
depend
upon
in
her
battle
with
the
world
poor
emily
a
feeble
overgrown
child
needing
fresh
air
which
she
could
not
get
needing
food
of
a
better
kind
just
as
unattainable
emily
she
too
already
in
the
clutch
of
the
great
brute
world
the
helpless
victim
of
a
civilisation
which
makes
its
food
of
those
the
heart
most
pities
how
well
if
her
last
sigh
had
been
drawn
in
infancy
if
she
had
lain
with
the
little
brother
and
sister
in
that
gaunt
grimy
cemetery
under
the
shadow
of
mill
chimneys
she
was
reserved
for
other
griefs
for
consolations
it
is
true
but
education
she
did
get
by
hook
or
by
crook
there
was
dire
pinching
to
pay
for
it
and
too
well
knowing
this
the
child
strove
her
utmost
to
use
the
opportunities
offered
her
each
morning
going
into
dunfield
taking
with
her
some
sandwiches
that
were
called
dinner
walking
home
again
by
tired
hungry
ah
hungry
no
matter
the
weather
she
must
walk
her
couple
of
miles
it
was
at
least
so
far
to
the
school
in
winter
you
saw
her
set
forth
with
her
waterproof
and
umbrella
the
bag
of
books
on
her
arm
sometimes
the
wind
and
rain
beating
as
if
to
delay
her
they
too
cruel
in
summer
the
hot
days
tried
her
perhaps
still
more
she
reached
home
in
the
afternoon
fainting
the
books
were
so
heavy
who
would
not
have
felt
kindly
to
her
so
gentle
she
was
so
dreadfully
shy
and
timid
her
eyes
so
eager
so
full
of
unconscious
pathos
little
girl
said
the
people
on
the
way
who
saw
her
pass
daily
and
however
completely
strangers
they
said
it
with
a
certain
kindness
of
tone
and
meaning
a
little
thing
that
happened
one
day
take
it
as
an
anecdote
on
her
way
to
school
she
passed
some
boys
who
were
pelting
a
most
wretched
dog
a
poor
scraggy
beast
driven
into
a
corner
emily
so
timid
usually
she
could
not
raise
her
eyes
before
a
stranger
stopped
quivering
all
over
them
to
cease
their
brutality
divine
compassion
become
a
heroism
the
boys
somehow
did
her
bidding
and
walked
on
together
emily
stayed
behind
opened
her
bag
threw
something
for
the
dog
to
eat
it
was
half
her
dinner
her
mind
braced
itself
she
had
a
passionate
love
of
learning
all
books
were
food
to
her
fortunately
there
was
the
library
of
the
institute
but
for
that
she
would
have
come
short
of
mental
sustenance
for
her
father
had
never
been
able
to
buy
mole
than
a
dozen
volumes
and
these
all
dealt
with
matters
of
physical
science
the
strange
things
she
read
books
which
came
down
to
her
from
the
shelves
with
a
thickness
of
dust
upon
them
histories
of
greece
and
rome
much
asked
for
these
said
the
librarian
translations
of
old
classics
the
koran
mosheim
history
works
of
swedenborg
all
the
poetry
she
could
lay
hands
on
novels
not
a
few
one
day
she
asked
for
a
book
on
hydroids
the
amazing
title
in
the
catalogue
had
filled
her
with
curiosity
she
must
know
the
meaning
of
everything
she
was
not
idle
emily
but
things
in
the
home
were
going
from
bad
to
worse
when
emily
was
sixteen
her
father
scarcely
knew
where
to
look
for
each
day
dinner
something
must
be
done
activity
took
a
twofold
direction
first
of
all
emily
got
work
as
a
teacher
in
an
infant
school
it
was
at
her
own
motion
she
could
bear
her
mother
daily
querulousness
no
longer
she
must
take
some
step
she
earned
a
mere
trifle
but
it
was
earning
instead
of
being
a
source
of
expense
and
in
the
meantime
she
worked
on
for
certain
examinations
which
it
would
benefit
her
to
have
passed
the
second
thing
done
was
that
her
father
abandoned
his
office
and
obtained
a
place
in
the
of
a
under
the
firm
of
dagworthy
and
son
his
salary
was
small
but
the
blessing
of
it
was
its
certainty
the
precariousness
of
his
existence
had
all
but
driven
poor
hood
mad
there
came
a
season
of
calm
emily
sphere
of
work
extended
itself
the
school
only
took
her
mornings
and
for
the
afternoon
there
was
proposed
to
her
the
teaching
of
the
little
baxendales
the
baxendales
were
people
the
father
was
just
then
mayor
of
dunfield
the
mother
was
related
to
the
member
of
parliament
for
the
town
we
have
had
mention
of
them
as
connections
of
beatrice
redwing
at
nineteen
she
for
the
first
time
left
home
through
the
baxendales
she
obtained
the
position
of
governess
in
a
family
residing
in
liverpool
and
remained
with
them
till
she
went
to
london
to
the
athels
these
three
years
in
liverpool
were
momentous
for
her
they
led
her
from
girlhood
to
womanhood
and
established
her
character
her
home
was
in
the
house
of
a
prosperous
a
lancashire
man
outwardly
a
blustering
animal
yet
with
an
inner
light
which
showed
itself
in
his
love
of
books
and
pictures
in
his
easy
walking
under
the
burden
of
riches
in
a
certain
generous
freedom
which
marked
his
life
and
thoughts
his
forename
was
laurence
emily
in
letters
to
her
father
used
to
call
him
lorenzo
the
magnificent
a
title
which
became
him
well
enough
in
the
collection
of
works
of
art
he
was
really
great
he
must
have
spent
appalling
sums
annually
on
his
picture
gallery
and
the
minor
ornaments
scattered
about
his
house
he
had
a
personal
acquaintance
through
his
pecuniary
dealings
with
the
foremost
artists
of
the
day
he
liked
to
proclaim
the
fact
and
describe
the
men
to
emily
the
constant
proximity
of
these
pictures
was
a
priceless
advantage
the
years
she
spent
among
them
were
equivalent
to
a
university
course
moreover
she
enjoyed
as
with
the
athels
later
a
free
command
of
books
here
began
her
acquaintance
with
the
most
modern
literature
which
was
needful
to
set
her
thoughts
in
order
to
throw
into
right
perspective
her
previous
miscellaneous
reading
and
to
mark
out
her
way
in
the
future
her
instinctive
craving
for
intellectual
beauty
acquired
a
reflective
consistency
she
reformed
her
ideals
found
the
loveliness
of
much
that
in
her
immaturity
had
seemed
barren
put
aside
with
gentle
firmness
much
that
had
appeared
indispensable
to
her
moral
life
the
meanings
which
she
attached
to
that
word
largely
modified
themselves
that
they
should
do
so
was
the
note
of
her
progress
her
prayer
was
for
in
the
inward
soul
which
if
it
grew
to
be
her
conviction
was
greatly
perhaps
wholly
dependent
on
the
perception
of
external
beauty
the
development
of
beauty
in
the
soul
would
mean
a
life
of
ideal
purity
all
her
instincts
pointed
to
such
a
life
her
passionate
motives
converged
on
the
one
end
of
spiritual
chastity
one
fear
she
had
to
strive
with
in
her
progress
toward
serene
convictions
the
misery
of
her
parents
home
haunted
her
and
by
no
effort
could
she
expel
the
superstition
that
she
had
only
escaped
from
that
for
a
time
that
its
claws
would
surely
overtake
her
and
fix
themselves
again
in
her
flesh
analysing
her
own
nature
she
discerned
or
thought
she
did
a
lack
of
independent
vigour
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
too
reliant
on
external
circumstances
she
dreaded
what
might
follow
if
their
assistance
were
withdrawn
to
be
sure
she
had
held
her
course
through
the
countless
discouragements
of
early
years
but
that
in
looking
back
seemed
no
assurance
for
the
future
her
courage
it
appeared
to
her
had
been
of
the
unconscious
kind
and
might
fail
her
when
she
consciously
demanded
it
as
a
child
she
had
once
walked
in
her
sleep
had
gone
forth
from
the
house
and
had
before
she
was
awakened
crossed
the
narrow
footing
of
a
a
thing
her
nervousness
would
not
allow
her
to
do
at
other
times
this
became
to
her
a
figure
the
feat
she
had
performed
when
mere
vital
instinct
guided
her
she
would
have
failed
in
when
attempting
it
with
the
full
understanding
of
its
danger
suppose
something
happened
which
put
an
end
to
her
independence
failure
of
health
some
supreme
calamity
at
home
could
she
hold
on
in
the
way
of
salvation
was
she
capable
of
conscious
heroism
could
her
soul
retain
its
ideal
of
beauty
if
environed
by
ugliness
the
vice
of
her
age
nay
why
call
it
a
vice
the
necessary
issue
of
that
intellectual
egoism
which
is
the
note
of
our
time
found
as
good
illustration
in
this
humble
life
as
in
men
and
women
who
are
the
mouthpieces
of
a
civilisation
pre
occupied
with
problems
of
her
own
relation
to
the
world
she
could
not
enjoy
without
thought
in
the
rear
ever
ready
to
trouble
her
with
suggestions
of
unreality
her
distresses
of
conscience
were
all
the
more
active
for
being
purely
human
in
her
soul
dwelt
an
immense
compassion
which
with
adequate
occasion
might
secure
to
itself
such
predominance
as
to
dwarf
into
inefficiency
her
religion
of
culture
it
was
exquisite
misery
to
conceive
as
from
inner
observation
she
so
well
could
some
demand
of
life
which
would
make
her
ideals
appear
the
dreams
of
bygone
halcyon
days
useless
and
worse
amid
the
threats
of
gathering
tempest
an
essentially
human
apprehension
be
it
understood
the
vulgarities
of
hysterical
pietism

had
never
known
she
did
not
fear
the
invasion
of
such
blight
as
that
the
thought
of
it
was
noisome
to
her
do
you
recall
a
kind
of
trouble
that
came
upon
her
during
that
talk
in
the
hollow
when
wilfrid
suggested
the
case
of
her
being
called
upon
to
make
some
great
sacrifice
in
her
behalf
it
was
an
instance
of
the
weakness
i
speak
of
the
fact
of
wilfrid
putting
forward
such
a
thought
had
in
that
moment
linked
her
to
him
with
precious
bonds
of
sympathy
till
she
felt
as
if
he
had
seen
into
the
most
secret
places
of
her
heart
she
dreaded
the
force
of
her
compassionateness
that
dog
by
the
roadside
how
the
anguish
of
its
eyes
had
haunted
her
through
the
day
i
it
was
the
revolt
of
her
whole
being
against
the
cruelty
inherent
in
life
that
evening
she
could
not
read
the
book
she
had
in
hand
its
phrases
seemed
to
fall
into
triviality
yet
she
reasoned
at
a
later
time
it
should
not
have
been
so
the
haggard
gaze
of
fate
should
not
daunt
one
pity
is
but
an
element
in
the
soul
ideal
of
order
it
should
not
usurp
a
barren
sovereignty
it
is
the
miserable
contradiction
in
our
lot
that
the
efficiency
of
the
instincts
of
waits
upon
a
force
of
individuality
attainable
only
by
a
sacrifice
of
sensibility
emily
divined
this
so
it
was
that
she
came
to
shun
the
thought
of
struggle
to
seek
an
abode
apart
from
turbid
conditions
of
life
she
was
bard
at
work
building
for
her
soul
its
its
palace
of
art
could
she
poor
as
she
was
dependent
bound
by
such
obvious
chains
to
the
gross
earth
hope
to
abide
in
her
courts
and
corridors
for
ever
friday
was
the
day
of
her
arrival
at
banbrigg
on
the
saturday
afternoon
she
hoped
to
enjoy
a
walk
with
her
father
he
would
reach
home
from
the
mill
shortly
after
two
and
would
then
have
his
dinner
mrs
hood
dined
at
one
and
could
not
bring
herself
to
alter
the
hour
for
saturday
it
was
characteristic
of
her
that
there
might
be
no
culinary
cares
on
sunday
morning
she
always
cooked
her
joint
of
meat
on
the
last
day
of
the
week
partaking
of
it
herself
at
one
she
cut
slices
for
her
husband
and
kept
them
warm
with
vegetables
in
the
oven
this
was
not
selfishness
in
theory
however
much
it
may
have
been
so
in
practice
it
merely
meant
that
she
was
unable
to
introduce
variation
into
a
mechanical
order
and
as
her
husband
never
dreamed
of
complaining
mrs
hood
could
see
in
the
arrangement
no
breach
of
the
fitness
of
things
even
though
it
meant
that
poor
hood
never
sat
down
to
a
freshly
cooked
meal
from
one
end
of
the
year
to
the
other
to
emily
it
was
simply
a
detestable
instance
of
the
worst
miseries
she
had
to
endure
at
home
coming
on
this
first
day
it
disturbed
her
much
she
knew
the
uselessness
the
danger
of
opposing
any
traditional
habit
but
her
appetite
at
one
was
small
mrs
hood
did
not
keep
a
servant
in
the
house
she
engaged
a
charwoman
once
a
week
and
did
all
the
work
at
other
times
herself
this
was
not
strictly
necessary
the
expense
of
such
a
servant
as
would
have
answered
purposes
could
just
have
been
afforded
again
and
again
emily
had
entreated
to
be
allowed
to
pay
a
girl
out
of
her
own
earnings
mrs
hood
steadily
refused
no
she
had
known
what
it
was
to
have
luxuries
about
her
that
was
naturally
before
her
marriage
but
those
days
were
gone
by
she
thus
entailed
upon
herself
a
great
deal
of
labour
at
once
repugnant
to
her
tastes
and
to
the
uncertainty
of
her
health
but
all
this
was
forgotten
in
the
solace
of
possessing
a
standing
grievance
one
obvious
at
all
moments
to
be
uttered
in
a
sigh
to
be
emphasised
by
the
affectation
of
cheerfulness
the
love
which
was
emily
instinct
grew
chill
in
the
presence
of
such
things
saturday
was
from
of
old
a
day
of
ills
the
charwoman
was
in
the
house
and
mrs
hood
went
about
in
a
fatigued
way
coming
now
and
then
to
the
sinking
into
a
chair
letting
her
head
fall
back
with
closed
eyes
emily
had
of
course
begged
to
be
allowed
to
give
assistance
but
her
mother
declared
that
there
was
nothing
whatever
she
could
do
the
door
she
said
then
you
wo
hear
the
scrubbing
so
plainly
i
can
understand
that
it
annoys
you
i
used
to
have
the
same
feeling
but
i
accustomed
myself
you
might
play
something
it
would
keep
away
your
thoughts
i
do
want
to
keep
away
my
thoughts
exclaimed
emily
with
a
laugh
want
to
help
you
so
that
you
will
have
done
the
sooner
no
my
dear
you
are
not
used
to
it
you
tell
me
when
you
like
something
to
eat
if
you
get
faint
am
not
likely
to
grow
faint
mother
if
i
do
nothing
well
i
have
a
sinking
feeling
now
and
then
i
thought
you
might
be
the
same
just
when
his
dinner
in
the
oven
had
had
time
to
grow
crusty
mr
hood
arrived
he
was
a
rather
tall
man
of
sallow
complexion
with
greyish
hair
the
peculiarly
melancholy
expression
of
his
face
was
due
to
the
excessive
drooping
of
his
eyelids
under
rounded
brows
beneath
the
eyes
were
heavy
lines
he
generally
looked
like
one
who
has
passed
through
a
night
of
sleepless
grief
he
wore
a
suit
of
black
which
had
for
several
years
been
his
reserve
attire
till
it
grew
too
seamy
for
use
on
sundays
the
whole
look
of
the
man
was
saddening
to
pass
him
in
the
street
as
a
stranger
was
to
experience
a
momentary
heaviness
of
heart
he
had
very
long
slender
fingers
emily
matchless
hand
in
a
rudimentary
form
and
it
seemed
to
be
a
particular
solicitude
to
keep
them
scrupulously
clean
he
frequently
examined
them
and
appeared
to
have
a
pleasure
in
handling
things
in
a
dainty
way
the
pages
of
a
book
for
instance
when
he
smiled
it
was
obviously
with
effort
a
painful
smile
for
all
that
an
exceedingly
gentle
one
in
his
voice
there
was
the
same
gentleness
a
as
it
were
his
way
of
speaking
half
explained
his
want
of
success
in
life
emily
was
standing
at
the
window
in
expectation
of
his
coming
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
iron
gate
in
front
of
the
house
she
ran
to
open
the
door
for
him
he
did
not
quicken
his
step
even
stopped
to
close
the
gate
with
deliberate
care
but
if
his
face
could
ever
be
said
to
light
up
it
did
so
as
he
bent
to
the
girl
kiss
she
took
his
hat
from
him
and
went
to
see
that
his
dinner
was
made
ready
fine
it
is
he
said
in
his
subdued
tone
when
he
came
downstairs
and
stood
by
the
table
stroking
his
newly
washed
hands
we
have
a
walk
before
mother
is
too
busy
i
afraid
mrs
hood
came
into
the
room
shortly
and
seated
herself
in
the
usual
way
you
bring
the
cake
she
asked
when
her
presence
had
caused
silence
for
a
few
moments
cake
he
repeated
in
surprise
i
ask
you
to
bring
a
cake
i
suppose
my
memory
is
going
i
meant
to
and
thought
i
mentioned
it
at
breakfast
i
shall
have
nothing
for
emily
tea
emily
protested
that
it
was
needless
to
get
unusual
things
on
her
account
must
do
what
we
can
to
make
you
comfortable
my
dear
i
ca
keep
a
table
like
that
you
are
accustomed
to
but
that
i
know
you
do
expect
which
way
are
you
going
to
walk
this
afternoon
if
you
pass
a
shop
you
might
get
a
cake
or
buns
whichever
you
like
i
thought
we
might
have
a
turn
over
the
heath
said
mr
hood
we
see
what
we
can
do
a
thought
of
some
anxious
kind
appeared
suddenly
to
strike
mrs
hood
she
leaned
forward
in
her
chair
seemed
to
listen
then
started
up
and
out
of
the
room
emily
sat
where
she
could
not
see
her
father
eating
it
pained
exasperated
her
to
be
by
him
whilst
he
made
such
a
meal
he
ate
slowly
with
thought
of
other
things
at
times
his
eye
wandered
to
the
window
and
he
regarded
the
sky
in
a
brooding
manner
he
satisfied
his
hunger
without
pleasure
apparently
with
indifference
shortly
after
three
the
two
started
for
their
walk
not
many
yards
beyond
the
house
the
road
passed
beneath
a
railway
bridge
then
over
a
canal
and
at
once
entered
upon
the
common
the
heath
formed
the
long
side
of
a
slowly
rising
hill
at
the
foot
the
road
divided
itself
into
two
branches
and
the
dusty
tracks
climbed
at
a
wide
angle
with
each
other
the
one
which
emily
and
her
father
pursued
led
up
to
stone
quarries
which
had
been
for
a
long
time
in
working
and
skirting
these
to
the
level
ground
above
them
which
was
the
end
of
the
region
of
furze
and
bracken
here
began
a
spacious
tract
of
grassy
common
around
it
were
houses
of
pleasant
appearance
one
or
two
meriting
the
name
of
mansion
in
one
of
them
dwelt
richard
dagworthy
the
in
whose
james
hood
earned
his
living
he
alone
represented
the
firm
of
dagworthy
and
son
his
father
had
been
dead
two
years
and
more
recently
he
had
become
a
widower
his
wife
leaving
him
one
child
still
an
infant
at
the
head
of
the
quarries
the
two
paused
to
look
back
upon
dunfield
the
view
from
this
point
was
extensive
and
would
have
been
interesting
but
for
the
existence
of
the
town
itself
it
was
seen
to
lie
in
a
broad
valley
along
which
a
river
flowed
the
remoter
districts
were
pleasantly
wooded
and
only
the
murkiness
in
the
far
sky
told
that
a
yet
larger
centre
of
industry
lurked
beyond
the
horizon
dunfield
offered
no
prominent
features
save
the
chimneys
of
its
factories
and
its
fine
church
the
spire
of
which
rose
high
above
surrounding
buildings
over
all
hung
a
canopy
of
foul
vapour
heavy
pestiferous
take
in
your
fingers
a
spray
from
one
of
the
trees
even
here
on
the
heath
and
its
touch
left
a
soil
i
wish
you
could
see
the
views
from
the
hills
in
surrey
emily
exclaimed
when
they
had
stood
in
silence
can
imagine
nothing
more
delightful
in
english
scenery
it
realises
my
idea
of
perfect
rural
beauty
as
i
got
it
from
engravings
after
the
landscape
painters
oh
you
shall
go
there
with
me
some
day
her
father
smiled
and
shook
his
head
a
little
he
said
and
added
a
favourite
phrase
of
his
there
is
life
there
is
hope
course
there
is
rejoined
emily
with
gaiety
which
was
unusual
in
her
smoke
the
hills
blue
against
a
lovely
sky
trees
covered
to
the
very
roots
with
greenness
rich
old
english
homes
and
cottages
oh
you
know
the
kind
your
ideal
of
a
cottage
low
tiled
roofs
latticed
windows
moss
and
lichen
and
climbing
flowers
farmyards
sweet
with
hay
and
gleaming
dairies
that
country
is
my
home
with
how
rich
a
poetry
it
clothed
itself
in
her
remembrance
the
land
of
milk
and
honey
indeed
her
heart
home
it
was
all
but
impossible
to
keep
the
secret
of
her
joy
yet
she
had
resolved
to
do
so
and
her
purpose
held
firm
am
very
glad
indeed
that
you
are
so
happy
there
sail
her
father
looking
at
her
with
that
quiet
absorption
in
another
mood
of
which
he
was
so
capable
it
will
be
london
through
the
winter
you
told
me
much
about
london
but
then
you
were
there
so
short
a
time
i
saw
much
rossall
could
not
have
been
kinder
for
the
first
few
days
it
was
almost
as
if
i
had
been
a
visitor
i
was
taken
everywhere
should
like
to
see
london
before
i
die
mused
her
father
i
have
never
managed
to
get
so
far
we
will
see
it
together
some
day
one
thing
said
mr
hood
reflectively
i
wish
especially
to
see
and
that
is
holborn
viaduct
it
must
be
a
wonderful
piece
of
engineering
i
remember
thinking
it
out
at
the
time
it
was
constructed
of
course
you
have
seen
it
am
afraid
not
we
are
very
far
away
from
the
city
but
i
will
go
and
see
it
on
the
first
opportunity
and
send
me
a
full
description
his
thoughts
reverted
to
the
views
before
them
all
this
is
so
bad
there
a
great
advantage
in
living
so
near
the
heath
i
sure
the
air
here
is
admirable
do
you
smell
how
fresh
it
is
and
then
one
gets
fond
of
the
place
one
lived
in
for
years
i
believe
i
should
find
it
hard
to
leave
dunfield
emily
smiled
gently
wonder
he
pursued
you
have
the
kind
of
feeling
that
came
to
me
just
then
it
struck
me
that
suppose
anything
happened
that
would
enable
us
to
go
and
live
in
another
place
there
would
be
a
sort
of
ingratitude
something
like
a
shabby
action
in
turning
one
back
on
the
old
spot
i
do
like
to
feel
unkind
even
to
a
town
the
girl
glanced
at
him
with
meaning
eyes
here
was
an
instance
of
the
sympathetic
relations
of
which
she
had
spoken
to
wilfrid
in
these
words
was
disclosed
the
origin
of
the
deepest
sensibilities
of
her
own
nature
they
pursued
their
walk
across
the
common
and
into
a
lane
emily
tried
to
believe
that
this
at
length
was
really
the
country
there
were
no
houses
in
view
meadows
lay
on
either
hand
the
leafage
was
thick
but
it
was
not
mere
prejudice
which
saw
in
every
object
a
struggle
with
hard
conditions
a
degeneration
into
coarseness
a
blight
the
quality
of
the
earth
was
probably
poor
to
begin
with
the
herbage
seemed
of
gross
fibre
one
would
not
risk
dipping
a
finger
in
the
stream
which
trickled
by
the
roadside
it
suggested
an
impure
source
and
behold
what
creatures
are
these
coming
along
the
lane
where
only
rustics
should
be
met
two
colliers
besmutted
wretches
plodding
homeward
from
the
which
is
half
a
mile
away
yes
their
presence
was
in
keeping
with
the
essential
character
of
the
scene
might
have
had
a
harder
life
mused
mr
hood
aloud
when
the
pitmen
were
gone
by
think
there
a
fallacy
in
that
replied
emily
life
is
probably
not
hard
at
all
i
used
to
feel
that
pity
but
i
have
reasoned
myself
out
of
it
they
are
really
happy
for
they
know
nothing
of
their
own
degradation
the
bye
said
her
father
presently
is
young
athel
the
young
fellow
who
had
to
come
home
from
college
is
quite
well
again
i
think
was
emily
reply
suppose
poor
fellow
he
has
a
very
weak
constitution
no
i
think
not
is
he
studying
for
going
into
the
church
emily
laughed
it
was
a
relief
to
do
so
it
strange
she
said
we
construct
an
idea
of
an
unknown
person
from
some
circumstance
or
piece
of
description
i
see
exactly
what
your
picture
of
athel
is
a
feeble
and
amiable
young
man
most
likely
with
the
shocking
voice
with
which
curates
sometimes
read
the
lessons
she
broke
off
and
laughed
again
said
her
father
admit
i
thought
of
him
a
little
in
that
way
i
scarcely
know
why
could
hardly
have
been
further
from
the
truth
try
to
imagine
the
intellectual
opposite
of
such
a
young
man
and
you
that
will
be
far
more
like
mr
athel
is
conceited
my
want
of
experience
has
an
unfortunate
tendency
to
make
me
think
of
young
fellows
in
his
position
as
unbearably
vain
it
must
be
so
hard
to
avoid
it
it
is
if
they
have
the
common
misfortune
to
be
born
without
brains
other
subjects
engaged
their
attention
do
you
take
your
holiday
father
emily
asked
think
about
the
middle
of
this
month
it
wo
be
more
than
a
week
or
ten
days
you
think
you
ought
to
go
to
cleethorpes
if
only
for
a
day
or
two
to
suggest
any
other
place
of
summer
retreat
would
have
been
too
alarming
mr
hood
defect
of
imagination
was
illustrated
in
this
matter
he
had
been
somehow
led
years
ago
to
pay
a
visit
to
cleethorpes
and
since
then
that
one
place
represented
for
him
the
seaside
others
might
be
just
as
accessible
and
considerably
more
delightful
but
it
did
not
even
occur
to
him
to
vary
it
would
have
cost
him
discomfort
to
do
so
the
apprehension
of
entering
upon
the
unknown
the
present
was
the
third
summer
which
had
passed
without
his
quitting
home
anxiety
troubled
his
countenance
as
emily
made
the
proposal
this
year
i
think
he
said
as
if
desirous
of
passing
the
subject
by
what
possible
objection
can
there
be
to
my
bearing
the
expense
of
a
week
at
cleethorpes
you
know
how
well
i
can
afford
it
indeed
i
should
like
to
go
it
is
rather
unkind
of
you
to
refuse
this
was
an
old
subject
of
discussion
since
emily
had
lived
away
from
home
not
only
her
father
but
her
mother
just
as
strenuously
had
refused
to
take
from
her
any
of
the
money
that
she
earned
it
had
been
her
habit
at
first
indirectly
to
overcome
this
resistance
by
means
of
substantial
presents
in
holiday
time
but
she
found
such
serious
discomfort
occasioned
by
the
practice
that
most
reluctantly
she
had
abandoned
it
for
the
understanding
of
the
hoods
attitude
in
this
matter
it
must
be
realised
how
deeply
their
view
of
life
was
coloured
by
years
of
incessant
preoccupation
with
pecuniary
difficulties
the
hideous
conception
of
existence
which
regards
each
individual
as
fighting
for
his
own
hand
striving
for
dear
life
against
every
other
individual
was
ingrained
in
their
minds
by
the
inveterate
bitterness
of
their
own
experience
when
emily
had
become
a
woman
and
was
gone
forth
to
wrest
from
the
adverse
world
her
own
subsistence
her
right
to
what
she
earned
was
indefeasible
and
affection
itself
protested
against
her
being
mulcted
for
their
advantage
as
for
the
slight
additional
expense
of
her
presence
at
home
during
the
holidays
she
must
not
be
above
paying
a
visit
to
her
parents
the
little
inconsistency
was
amiable
enough
father
and
mother
both
held
forth
to
her
in
the
same
tone
have
the
battle
of
life
before
you
it
is
a
terrible
one
and
the
world
is
relentless
not
only
is
it
your
right
but
your
very
duty
to
spare
every
penny
you
can
for
if
anything
happened
to
prevent
your
earning
money
you
would
become
a
burden
upon
us
a
burden
we
would
gladly
strive
to
bear
but
the
thought
of
which
would
be
very
hard
for
yourself
if
on
the
other
hand
your
mother
were
left
a
widow
think
how
dreadful
it
would
be
if
you
could
give
her
no
assistance
you
are
wrong
in
spending
one
farthing
more
than
your
absolute
needs
require
to
say
you
do
it
in
kindness
to
us
is
a
mere
mistake
of
yours
the
logic
was
not
to
be
encountered
it
was
as
irresistible
as
the
social
conditions
which
gave
it
birth
emily
had
abandoned
discussion
on
these
points
such
reasoning
cost
her
sickness
of
heart
in
practice
she
obeyed
her
parents
injunctions
for
she
herself
was
hitherto
only
too
well
aware
of
the
fate
which
might
come
upon
her
in
consequence
of
the
most
trifling
mishap
she
knew
that
no
soul
in
the
world
save
her
parents
would
think
it
a
duty
to
help
her
save
in
the
way
of
bare
charity
naturally
her
old
point
of
view
was
now
changed
it
was
this
that
led
her
to
revive
the
discussion
with
her
father
and
to
speak
in
a
tone
which
mr
hood
heard
with
some
surprise
year
perhaps
emily
he
said
surrey
i
do
think
you
can
really
need
another
change
i
am
delighted
to
see
how
well
you
look
i
too
am
remarkably
well
and
i
ca
help
thinking
your
mother
gets
stronger
how
do
you
find
her
looking
than
usual
i
really
think
all
the
same
it
is
clearly
impossible
for
you
and
her
to
live
on
year
after
year
without
any
kind
of
change
my
dear
we
do
feel
it
it
so
different
with
older
people
a
change
rather
upsets
us
than
otherwise
you
know
how
nervous
your
mother
gets
when
she
is
away
from
home
their
walk
brought
them
round
again
to
the
top
of
the
heath
mr
hood
looked
at
his
watch
and
found
that
it
was
time
to
be
moving
homewards
tea
was
punctually
at
five
mrs
hood
would
take
it
ill
if
they
were
late
especially
on
saturday
as
they
walked
across
the
smooth
part
of
the
upper
common
looking
at
the
houses
around
they
saw
coming
towards
them
a
gentleman
followed
by
three
dogs
he
was
dressed
in
a
light
tweed
suit
and
brandished
a
as
if
animal
spirits
possessed
him
strongly
here
comes
dagworthy
remarked
mr
hood
in
a
low
tone
though
the
other
was
still
at
a
considerable
distance
generally
goes
off
somewhere
on
saturday
afternoon
what
a
man
he
is
for
dogs
i
believe
he
keeps
twenty
or
thirty
at
the
house
there
emily
evinced
just
a
little
it
was
possible
that
dagworthy
would
stop
to
speak
for
she
had
become
in
a
measure
acquainted
with
him
in
the
preceding
spring
she
was
at
home
then
for
a
few
weeks
before
her
departure
for
london
and
the
baxendales
who
had
always
shown
her
much
kindness
invited
her
to
an
evening
party
at
which
dagworthy
was
present
he
had
chatted
with
her
on
that
occasion
yes
he
was
going
to
speak
he
was
a
man
of
robust
rather
florid
with
eyes
which
it
was
not
disagreeable
to
meet
though
they
gazed
with
embarrassing
persistency
and
a
mouth
which
he
would
have
done
well
to
leave
under
the
natural
shelter
of
a
moustache
it
was
at
once
hard
and
sensual
the
of
his
face
gave
his
appearance
a
youthfulness
to
which
his
tone
of
speech
did
not
correspond
do
you
do
miss
hood
come
once
more
into
our
part
of
the
world
then
you
have
been
in
london
i
hear
it
was
the
tone
of
a
man
long
accustomed
to
have
his
own
way
in
life
and
not
overmuch
troubled
with
delicacies
of
feeling
his
address
could
not
be
called
disrespectful
but
the
smile
which
accompanied
it
expressed
a
sort
of
patronage
perhaps
inevitable
in
such
a
man
when
speaking
to
his
clerk
daughter
the
presence
of
the
clerk
himself
very
little
concerned
him
he
kept
his
eyes
steadily
on
the
girl
face
examining
her
with
complete
frankness
his
utterance
was
that
of
an
educated
man
but
it
had
something
of
the
yorkshire
accent
a
broadness
which
would
have
distressed
the
ear
in
a
emily
replied
that
she
had
been
in
london
it
did
not
seem
necessary
to
enter
into
details
afternoon
is
it
makes
one
want
to
get
away
to
the
moors
i
suppose
you
will
be
off
somewhere
soon
with
your
family
mr
hood
he
would
not
have
employed
the
formal
prefix
to
his
clerk
name
but
for
emily
presence
the
father
knew
that
and
felt
grateful
this
year
i
think
sir
he
replied
with
perfect
cheerfulness
of
the
three
dogs
that
accompanied
dagworthy
one
was
a
handsome
collie
this
animal
came
snuffing
at
emily
hand
and
involuntarily
glad
perhaps
to
have
a
pretence
for
averting
her
face
she
caressed
the
silky
ears
head
is
it
miss
hood
said
dagworthy
at
once
causing
her
to
remove
her
hand
quickly
but
i
a
finer
collie
than
that
just
walk
in
with
me
will
you
he
added
after
a
scarcely
perceptible
pause
always
like
to
show
off
my
dogs
you
in
no
hurry
i
suppose
just
come
and
have
a
look
at
the
kennels
emily
was
deeply
annoyed
both
because
such
a
visit
was
in
itself
distasteful
to
her
and
on
account
of
the
irritation
which
she
knew
the
delay
would
cause
her
mother
she
did
not
for
a
moment
expect
her
father
to
refuse
his
position
would
not
allow
him
to
do
so
mr
hood
in
fact
murmured
thanks
after
a
mere
half
glance
at
his
daughter
and
the
three
walked
together
to
dagworthy
house
the
entrance
to
which
was
not
fifty
yards
from
where
they
were
standing
the
dwelling
was
neither
large
nor
handsome
but
it
stood
in
a
fine
garden
and
had
an
air
of
solid
as
soon
as
they
had
passed
the
gates
they
were
met
by
a
woman
carrying
a
child
of
two
years
old
an
infant
of
wonderfully
hearty
appearance
at
the
sight
of
its
father
it
chuckled
and
crowed
dagworthy
took
it
from
the
arms
and
began
a
game
which
looked
not
a
little
dangerous
with
surprising
strength
and
skill
he
tossed
it
up
some
feet
into
the
air
caught
it
as
it
descended
tossed
it
up
again
the
child
shrieked
with
delight
for
all
that
the
swift
descent
positively
stopped
its
breath
and
made
a
hiatus
in
the
screaming
that
abaht
enough
richard
said
the
woman
in
broad
dialect
when
the
child
had
gone
up
half
a
dozen
times
she
was
nervous
and
kept
holding
out
her
arms
involuntarily
doa
ovver
much
fancy
that
kind
o
laakin
what
more
he
allus
reight
dahn
fratchy
after
a
turn
o
that
see
nah
he
nivver
want
you
to
stop
do
a
done
nah
mr
richard
you
are
then
take
him
in
and
tell
them
i
want
some
tea
say
i
have
friends
with
me
the
child
was
carried
away
roaring
obstreperously
and
dagworthy
laughing
at
the
vocal
power
displayed
led
the
way
round
to
the
back
of
the
house
here
had
been
constructed
elaborate
kennels
several
dogs
were
pacing
in
freedom
about
the
clean
yard
and
many
more
were
chained
up
much
information
was
imparted
to
the
visitors
concerning
the
more
notable
animals
some
had
taken
prizes
at
shows
others
were
warranted
to
do
so
one
or
two
had
been
purchased
at
fancy
prices
mr
hood
now
and
then
put
a
question
as
in
duty
bound
to
do
emily
restricted
her
speech
to
the
absolutely
necessary
replies
dagworthy
conducted
them
into
the
house
it
appeared
to
be
furnished
in
a
solid
way
and
the
ornaments
though
few
were
such
as
might
better
have
been
dispensed
with
old
dagworthy
had
come
to
live
here
some
years
previously
having
before
that
occupied
a
small
house
in
conjunction
with
his
mill
he
had
been
one
of
the
of
dunfield
and
in
his
time
did
a
good
deal
of
useful
work
for
the
town
personally
he
was
anything
but
amiable
being
devoid
of
education
and
refinement
and
priding
himself
on
his
spirit
of
independence
which
exhibited
itself
in
mere
boorishness
though
anything
but
miserly
he
had
where
his
interests
were
concerned
an
extraordinary
cunning
and
pertinacity
he
was
universally
regarded
as
one
of
the
shrewdest
men
of
business
in
that
part
of
yorkshire
and
report
credited
him
with
any
number
of
remarkable
meannesses
it
was
popularly
said
that
dick
dagworthy
would
shrink
from
no
dirty
trick
to
turn
a
sixpence
but
was
as
likely
as
not
to
give
it
away
as
soon
as
he
had
got
it
his
son
had
doubtless
advanced
the
character
of
the
stock
and
putting
aside
the
breeding
of
dogs
possessed
many
tastes
of
which
the
old
man
had
no
notion
none
the
less
he
was
credited
with
not
a
little
of
his
father
spirit
in
business
in
practical
affairs
he
was
shrewd
and
active
he
never
as
poor
hood
might
have
testified
paid
a
man
in
his
employ
a
penny
more
than
there
was
need
and
fell
far
short
of
the
departed
dagworthy
generosity
to
be
at
his
mercy
in
a
pecuniary
transaction
was
to
expect
and
to
receive
none
for
all
that
there
was
something
in
the
man
which
hinted
at
qualities
beneath
the
surface
a
glance
a
tone
now
and
then
which
seemed
on
the
point
of
revealing
a
hidden
humanity
when
he
chose
he
could
be
courteous
he
was
so
at
present
as
he
requested
emily
and
her
father
to
seat
themselves
in
a
large
homely
room
which
looked
out
upon
the
garden
the
woman
who
had
carried
the
child
reappeared
and
poured
out
cups
of
tea
when
she
had
left
the
room
must
ask
you
to
excuse
the
roughness
of
my
establishment
miss
hood
he
said
have
to
make
shift
for
the
resent
with
jenkins
she
is
as
refined
as
she
might
e
but
she
been
with
us
here
for
more
than
twelve
years
and
i
should
be
sorry
to
replace
her
with
any
other
servant
pieces
of
bread
and
butter
of
somewhat
undue
solidity
were
offered
emily
anything
but
the
cup
of
tea
she
was
very
ill
at
ease
though
she
succeeded
in
suppressing
any
manifestation
of
it
dagworthy
kept
his
gaze
on
her
constantly
i
know
you
did
care
very
much
about
the
dogs
he
said
to
her
presently
think
i
got
something
here
that
will
be
rather
more
in
your
line
he
brought
from
a
corner
of
the
room
a
large
portfolio
set
it
upon
a
chair
in
front
of
emily
and
exposed
its
contents
these
were
a
number
of
fine
photographs
of
continental
cathedrals
and
churches
bought
these
when
i
took
my
run
through
france
and
germany
last
year
he
explained
something
of
a
turn
for
architecture
i
believe
at
all
events
i
know
i
like
a
fine
building
and
i
like
to
find
out
all
i
can
about
it
he
went
through
the
collection
with
remarks
which
proved
that
he
had
certainly
attained
a
rudimentary
knowledge
of
the
subject
and
that
his
appreciation
was
often
keen
when
his
technical
understanding
might
be
at
fault
worst
of
it
is
he
said
at
one
point
with
a
modesty
which
was
a
new
feature
in
his
conversation
ca
pronounce
the
names
properly
now
how
do
you
read
that
miss
hood
to
be
sure
i
know
it
when
i
hear
it
have
you
ever
been
in
france
the
negative
reply
came
like
to
see
the
streets
in
which
some
of
these
churches
stand
as
soon
as
it
was
possible
to
do
so
emily
looked
meaningly
at
her
father
and
he
just
as
anxious
to
be
on
his
way
homeward
rose
for
dagworthy
offered
no
opposition
he
went
with
them
to
the
gates
and
shook
hands
with
both
then
stood
gazing
after
them
as
they
walked
across
the
common
i
never
knew
young
dagworthy
anything
like
that
before
said
mr
hood
when
they
were
at
some
distance
from
the
gate
could
believe
it
when
he
asked
us
to
go
into
the
house
afraid
mother
will
be
very
uneasy
was
emily
reply
my
dear
i
afraid
she
will
let
walk
sharply
but
he
was
really
uncommonly
pleasant
i
shall
think
a
good
deal
better
of
him
than
i
have
done
this
was
the
only
aspect
of
the
afternoon
adventure
which
presented
itself
to
mr
hood
emily
was
divided
between
relief
at
having
got
away
from
that
persistent
gaze
and
apprehension
of
what
might
meet
them
on
their
arrival
at
home
the
latter
feeling
was
only
too
well
justified
mrs
hood
sat
in
the
kitchen
the
window
darkened
when
speech
was
at
length
elicited
from
her
it
appeared
that
a
headache
to
which
she
was
subject
had
come
on
in
its
severest
form
emily
was
at
once
active
with
remedies
not
that
any
of
those
that
she
urged
were
likely
to
avail
themselves
but
because
she
was
well
aware
that
the
more
solicitude
she
showed
the
sooner
her
mother
would
resume
her
ordinary
state
mrs
hood
begged
to
be
left
to
herself
let
them
have
their
tea
and
leave
her
in
the
kitchen
she
was
best
there
out
of
people
way
it
would
soon
be
bedtime
the
evening
was
practically
gone
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
she
was
at
length
prevailed
upon
to
come
into
the
and
even
to
taste
a
cup
of
tea
at
first
she
had
paid
no
attention
to
the
reasons
alleged
for
the
unpunctuality
little
by
little
she
began
to
ask
questions
on
her
own
account
petulantly
but
with
growing
interest
still
the
headache
was
not
laid
aside
and
all
spent
a
very
dolorous
evening
in
the
relation
these
things
have
their
humorous
side
emily
may
be
excused
if
she
was
slow
to
appreciate
it
she
knew
very
well
that
the
crisis
meant
for
her
father
several
days
of
misery
and
perhaps
in
her
youthful
energy
she
was
disposed
to
make
too
little
allowance
for
her
mother
whose
life
had
been
so
full
of
hardship
and
who
even
now
was
suffering
from
cares
and
anxieties
the
worst
of
which
her
daughter
was
not
allowed
to
perceive
after
the
girl
early
departure
to
her
bedroom
the
other
two
sat
talking
drearily
after
one
of
her
headaches
mrs
hood
always
dwelt
in
conversation
on
the
most
wretched
features
of
her
life
with
despairing
forecast
poor
woman
there
was
little
of
a
brighter
kind
to
occupy
her
thoughts
two
occasions
of
grave
anxiety
were
at
present
troubling
her
and
though
he
spoke
of
them
less
her
husband
in
no
less
a
degree
it
had
just
been
announced
to
them
that
at
the
ensuing
christmas
their
rent
would
be
raised
and
at
the
same
time
the
tenant
who
had
for
years
occupied
the
house
which
they
owned
in
the
town
of
barnhill
had
given
notice
of
departure
there
was
a
certain
grotesqueness
in
the
fact
of
james
hood
being
a
proprietor
of
real
estate
twice
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
sell
the
house
in
question
but
no
purchaser
could
be
found
the
building
was
in
poor
repair
was
constantly
entailing
expense
to
the
landlord
and
in
the
event
of
its
becoming
unoccupied
would
doubtless
wait
long
for
another
tenant
this
event
had
come
about
or
would
in
a
couple
of
months
and
the
loss
of
that
pounds
a
year
would
make
the
difficulty
of
existence
yet
more
desperate
once
more
an
attempt
at
sale
must
be
made
in
itself
involving
outlays
which
however
petty
could
ill
be
borne
and
to
sell
even
if
it
could
be
done
meant
a
serious
loss
of
income
did
it
mean
do
you
think
mrs
hood
asked
recurring
to
the
subject
of
dagworthy
and
his
astonishing
behaviour
she
put
the
question
dispiritedly
not
venturing
to
hope
for
a
solution
that
would
help
her
to
a
more
cheerful
frame
of
mind
hood
scarcely
dared
to
utter
the
words
which
came
into
his
mind
remember
that
they
met
at
the
baxendales
did
emily
behave
the
mother
next
inquired
was
very
quiet
i
do
think
she
liked
it
we
must
bear
in
mind
the
kind
of
society
she
is
used
to
young
dagworthy
wo
seem
of
much
account
to
her
i
fancy
he
has
had
a
good
education
has
he
good
i
suppose
he
confessed
to
us
though
that
he
pronounce
french
words
quite
certain
said
mrs
hood
would
have
invited
you
in
if
you
had
been
alone
enough
was
the
reply
in
a
tone
wholly
disinterested
it
must
have
been
just
a
fancy
a
whim
things
of
that
kind
do
happen
nowadays
to
us
at
all
events
murmured
the
other
dejectedly
there
must
come
what
will
she
added
leaning
her
head
back
once
more
and
losing
interest
in
the
subject
hope
nothing
and
expect
nothing
alas
these
two
sitting
together
in
the
dull
little
room
speaking
in
disjointed
phrases
of
despondency
exchanging
no
look
no
word
of
mutual
kindness
had
they
not
once
loved
each
other
with
the
love
of
youth
and
hope
had
it
not
once
been
enough
to
sit
through
long
evenings
and
catch
with
eagerness
each
other
lightest
word
time
had
robbed
them
of
youth
and
the
injustice
of
the
world
order
had
starved
love
to
less
than
a
shadow
of
itself
to
a
more
habit
of
common
suffering
tender
memories
were
buried
in
the
grave
of
children
whom
the
resources
of
ever
so
modest
a
fortune
would
have
kept
alive
the
present
was
a
mere
struggle
to
support
existence
choking
the
impulses
of
affection
one
would
not
murmur
at
the
kindly
order
of
life
whereby
passion
gives
place
to
gentle
habitudes
and
the
fiery
soul
of
youth
tames
itself
to
comely
gravity
but
that
love
and
joy
the
delights
of
eager
sense
and
of
hallowed
aspiration
should
be
smothered
in
the
foul
dust
of
a
brute
combat
for
bread
that
the
stinted
energies
of
early
years
should
change
themselves
to
the
blasted
hopes
of
failing
manhood
in
a
world
made
ill
by
human
perverseness
this
is
not
easily
it
may
be
not
well
borne
with
patience
put
money
in
thy
purse
and
again
put
money
in
thy
purse
for
as
the
world
is
ordered
to
lack
current
coin
is
to
lack
the
privileges
of
humanity
and
indigence
is
the
death
of
the
soul
chapter
vi
a
visitor
by
express
it
had
been
arranged
that
emily
should
receive
news
from
wilfrid
by
the
first
post
on
monday
morning
her
father
left
home
at
eight
and
emily
a
little
ashamed
at
so
deceiving
him
went
into
the
town
at
the
same
time
on
pretence
of
a
desire
to
share
his
walk
taking
leave
of
him
as
soon
as
the
mill
was
in
sight
she
walked
towards
the
at
this
early
hour
there
was
no
one
before
the
counter
she
overcame
her
nervousness
and
asked
for
letters
that
which
she
expected
was
given
to
her
and
at
the
same
time
a
telegram
the
sight
of
the
telegram
agitated
her
drawing
aside
she
opened
it
at
once
wilfrid
had
despatched
it
the
previous
night
from
london
shall
be
in
dunfield
at
one
please
leave
a
note
for
me
at
the
appointing
any
place
of
meeting
at
any
time
you
like
i
shall
find
the
place
from
your
description
the
letter
as
she
could
perceive
by
feeling
it
was
long
there
was
no
necessity
to
open
it
until
she
reached
home
but
the
note
she
must
write
at
once
in
agitation
which
would
scarcely
allow
her
to
reflect
she
left
the
office
and
sought
a
small
shop
where
she
could
procure
on
her
way
she
devised
a
plan
for
meeting
in
the
shop
where
she
made
her
purchase
she
was
permitted
also
to
write
the
note
having
stamped
the
envelope
she
returned
to
the
and
to
make
sure
that
no
delay
might
disappoint
wilfrid
gave
the
letter
into
the
hands
of
a
clerk
who
promised
with
a
smile
that
it
should
at
once
be
put
into
the
right
place
emily
found
the
smile
hard
to
bear
but
fortunately
she
was
unknown
then
she
set
forth
homewards
such
news
as
this
that
she
would
see
and
speak
with
wilfrid
in
a
few
hours
set
at
defiance
between
joy
at
the
thought
that
even
now
he
was
nearing
her
and
fear
of
the
events
which
might
have
led
him
to
such
a
step
she
was
swayed
in
a
tumult
of
emotion
she
longed
to
open
the
letter
yet
felt
she
could
not
do
so
in
the
public
roads
she
tried
to
think
whether
any
ill
chance
could
possibly
interpose
to
prevent
her
being
at
the
place
of
meeting
none
was
to
be
anticipated
unless
what
was
very
unlikely
her
mother
should
propose
to
join
her
afternoon
walk
but
what
could
his
coming
mean
she
feared
that
she
understood
too
well
often
she
had
to
check
the
of
her
pace
and
the
way
seemed
terribly
long
but
at
length
she
was
at
home
and
close
shut
in
her
bedroom
the
letter
did
not
aid
her
to
account
for
his
coming
it
had
been
written
late
on
friday
night
but
made
absolutely
no
reference
to
what
had
passed
between
wilfrid
and
his
relations
it
was
a
long
and
passionate
poem
of
his
love
concerned
not
with
outward
facts
but
with
states
of
feeling
only
at
the
end
he
had
added
a
postscript
saying
that
he
should
write
again
on
monday
it
was
difficult
to
live
through
the
morning
she
felt
that
she
must
be
busy
with
her
hands
and
her
mother
objections
notwithstanding
set
herself
resolutely
to
active
housework
her
anxious
feelings
in
this
way
toned
themselves
to
mere
cheerfulness
she
listened
with
unfailing
patience
to
the
lengthily
described
details
of
domestic
annoyances
of
which
mrs
hood
conversation
chiefly
consisted
and
did
her
best
to
infuse
into
her
replies
a
tone
of
hopefulness
which
might
animate
without
betraying
too
much
the
hours
passed
over
and
at
length
it
was
time
to
set
forth
mrs
hood
showed
no
desire
to
leave
home
emily
though
foreseeing
that
she
might
again
be
late
for
tea
did
not
venture
to
hint
at
such
a
possibility
but
started
as
if
for
a
short
walk
not
much
more
than
a
mile
from
banbrigg
in
a
direction
away
alike
from
the
heath
and
from
dunfield
is
the
village
of
pendal
where
stand
the
remains
of
an
ancient
castle
very
slight
indeed
are
these
relics
one
window
and
some
shapeless
masses
of
defaced
masonry
being
alone
exposed
but
a
hill
close
beside
them
is
supposed
to
cover
more
of
the
fabric
though
history
tells
not
how
or
when
the
earth
was
so
heaped
up
the
circle
of
the
moat
is
still
complete
and
generally
contains
water
pendal
castle
hill
as
the
locality
is
called
is
approached
by
a
rustic
lane
leading
from
the
village
it
is
enclosed
like
an
ordinary
meadow
and
shadowed
here
and
there
with
trees
on
sundays
and
holidays
it
is
a
resort
much
favoured
by
dunfieldians
at
other
times
its
solitude
is
but
little
interfered
with
knowing
this
emily
had
appointed
the
spot
for
the
meeting
she
had
directed
wilfrid
to
take
a
train
from
dunfield
to
pendal
and
had
described
the
walk
up
to
the
castle
hill
he
was
not
before
her
this
time
and
there
were
endless
reasons
for
fear
lest
she
should
wait
in
vain
she
remained
standing
on
the
inner
side
of
the
stile
by
which
the
field
was
entered
and
kept
her
gaze
on
the
point
where
the
lane
turned
a
long
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
then
of
a
sudden
the
expected
form
appeared
there
had
been
no
train
to
pendal
at
the
right
time
he
had
taken
a
meal
at
dunfield
station
and
then
had
found
a
cab
to
convey
him
to
the
village
wilfrid
was
very
calm
only
the
gleam
of
his
fine
eyes
showed
his
delight
at
holding
her
hands
again
they
walked
to
the
side
of
the
hill
remote
from
the
road
wilfrid
looked
about
him
and
remarked
that
the
place
was
interesting
he
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
speak
of
what
had
brought
him
here
they
walked
hand
in
hand
like
children
and
then
his
name
in
return
with
interchange
of
looks
was
it
not
enough
for
some
minutes
is
a
fallen
trunk
wilfrid
said
pointing
to
a
remoter
spot
we
sit
there
well
it
has
been
managed
he
exclaimed
when
they
had
seated
themselves
remember
the
fairy
tales
in
which
the
old
woman
bids
some
one
go
to
a
certain
place
and
do
such
and
such
a
thing
and
something
is
sure
to
happen
and
it
befell
just
as
the
old
woman
had
said
i
am
the
old
woman
they
call
her
a
witch
in
the
stories
witch
yes
but
so
young
and
beautiful
what
delight
it
was
to
find
your
letter
dearest
what
careful
directions
i
laughed
at
your
dreadful
anxiety
to
make
it
quite
quite
clear
wo
you
take
the
glove
off
how
your
hand
trembles
no
i
will
unbutton
it
myself
he
kissed
the
fingers
lightly
and
then
held
them
pressed
why
have
you
come
all
this
distance
wilfrid
it
not
be
enough
if
i
said
i
had
come
to
see
you
what
distance
would
be
too
far
for
that
you
were
to
have
left
england
i
was
but
i
shall
not
go
till
you
go
with
me
emily
she
looked
at
him
with
anxious
eyes
i
will
tell
you
all
there
is
to
tell
in
the
first
place
my
father
and
my
aunt
think
that
the
plan
of
your
returning
to
teach
the
little
girls
is
not
a
very
good
one
he
spoke
with
perfect
cheerfulness
but
firmly
as
was
his
wont
eyes
fell
have
felt
it
myself
she
said
so
have
i
so
that
we
are
happily
all
agreed
we
talked
it
all
over
after
you
had
gone
on
friday
and
since
then
i
have
taken
time
to
make
up
my
mind
i
can
see
that
you
would
be
uncomfortable
in
the
house
under
such
conditions
at
the
same
time
it
is
certainly
out
of
the
question
that
you
should
go
elsewhere
and
so
come
to
london
and
let
us
be
married
as
soon
as
the
arrangements
can
be
made
do
quite
understand
wilfrid
do
you
mean
that
your
father
approves
this
all
went
off
he
knows
no
doubt
what
my
intention
is
in
a
matter
like
this
i
must
judge
for
myself
she
was
silent
then
asked
with
apprehension
it
caused
trouble
the
kind
which
passes
as
soon
as
it
has
been
well
talked
about
he
answered
with
a
smile
more
serious
she
could
not
meet
his
look
you
wish
not
to
return
to
oxford
have
done
with
that
i
see
now
that
to
go
back
and
play
the
schoolboy
would
have
been
impossible
all
that
is
over
and
a
new
life
beginning
you
will
be
in
readiness
to
come
up
as
soon
as
i
scud
for
you
she
looked
in
his
face
now
with
pleading
is
too
hasty
wilfrid
it
was
better
far
better
that
we
should
wait
till
next
year
can
it
be
your
father
wish
that
your
marriage
should
take
place
in
his
absence
you
know
that
i
have
no
foolish
desires
the
more
simply
everything
is
done
the
better
it
will
please
me
but
i
would
i
would
have
it
done
with
your
father
goodwill
i
foresaw
his
objections
only
too
well
they
are
natural
it
could
not
be
otherwise
but
i
hoped
that
time
would
help
let
us
wait
she
closed
both
hands
on
his
and
gazed
at
him
steadily
think
you
must
be
guided
by
me
emily
he
replied
with
his
calm
is
no
reason
why
we
should
wait
my
father
is
a
man
who
very
sensibly
accepts
the
accomplished
fact
his
own
marriage
i
may
tell
you
was
an
affair
of
decision
in
the
face
of
superficial
objections
and
he
will
only
think
the
better
of
me
for
following
his
example
you
say
and
i
am
sure
that
you
care
nothing
for
the
show
of
a
wedding
if
you
did
i
should
not
be
here
at
this
moment
it
is
only
for
that
that
we
need
postpone
the
marriage
i
will
take
rooms
till
i
can
find
a
house
and
have
it
made
ready
for
us
emily
kept
silence
she
had
released
his
hand
there
were
signs
on
her
face
of
severe
inward
conflict
you
let
me
go
and
see
your
parents
he
asked
our
marriage
take
place
here
to
me
it
is
the
same
i
would
only
be
ruled
by
your
choice
may
i
go
home
with
you
now
would
say
yes
if
i
could
make
up
my
mind
to
a
marriage
at
once
she
answered
let
me
persuade
you
sound
of
your
words
persuades
too
strongly
against
their
sense
emily
he
said
tenderly
will
not
put
off
our
marriage
a
day
longer
than
forms
make
necessary
let
me
say
what
have
scraps
of
superstition
in
my
nature
he
broke
in
with
a
half
laugh
does
not
often
deal
so
kindly
as
in
giving
you
to
me
i
dare
not
even
to
hesitate
before
the
gift
it
is
a
test
of
the
worth
that
is
in
us
we
meet
by
chance
and
we
recognise
each
other
here
is
the
end
for
which
we
might
have
sought
a
lifetime
we
are
not
worthy
of
it
if
we
hold
back
from
paltry
considerations
i
dare
not
leave
you
emily
everything
points
to
one
result
the
rejection
of
the
scheme
for
your
return
my
father
free
surrender
of
the
decision
to
myself
the
irresistible
impulse
which
has
brought
me
here
to
you
did
i
tell
you
that
i
rose
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
went
to
charing
cross
to
telegraph
it
would
have
done
just
as
well
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
but
i
could
not
rest
till
the
message
was
sent
i
will
have
no
appearances
come
between
us
there
shall
be
no
pause
till
you
bear
my
name
and
have
entered
my
home
after
that
let
life
do
with
us
what
it
will
emily
drank
in
the
vehement
flow
of
words
with
delight
and
fear
it
was
this
virile
eagerness
this
force
of
personality
which
had
before
charmed
her
thought
into
passiveness
and
made
her
senses
its
subject
but
a
stronger
motive
of
resistance
actuated
her
now
in
her
humility
she
could
not
deem
the
instant
gain
of
herself
to
be
an
equivalent
to
him
for
what
he
would
certainly
and
what
he
might
perchance
lose
she
feared
that
he
had
disguised
his
father
real
displeasure
and
she
could
not
reconcile
herself
to
the
abrupt
overthrow
of
all
the
purposes
wilfrid
had
entertained
before
he
knew
her
she
strove
with
all
the
energy
of
her
own
strong
character
to
withstand
him
for
his
good
let
it
at
least
be
postponed
till
your
father
return
if
his
mind
is
what
you
say
he
will
by
then
have
fully
accepted
your
views
i
respect
your
father
i
owe
him
consideration
he
is
prejudiced
against
me
now
and
i
would
gain
his
goodwill
just
because
we
are
perfectly
independent
let
us
have
regard
for
others
better
a
thousand
times
better
that
he
should
be
reconciled
to
our
marriage
before
it
takes
place
than
perforce
afterwards
is
it
for
my
constancy
or
your
own
that
you
fear
do
not
doubt
your
love
and
my
own
is
unalterable
i
fear
circumstances
but
what
has
fear
to
do
with
it
i
wish
to
make
you
my
own
the
empire
of
my
passion
is
i
will
not
wait
if
you
refuse
me
i
have
been
mistaken
you
do
not
love
me
are
only
words
she
answered
a
proud
smile
lighting
the
trouble
of
her
countenance
have
said
that
you
do
not
doubt
my
love
and
in
your
heart
you
can
not
answer
me
one
question
wilfrid
have
you
made
little
of
your
father
opposition
in
order
to
spare
me
pain
is
it
more
serious
than
you
are
willing
to
tell
me
the
temptation
was
strong
to
reply
with
an
affirmative
if
she
believed
his
father
to
be
utterly
irreconcilable
there
could
be
no
excuse
for
lingering
yet
his
nobler
self
prevailed
to
her
no
word
of
falseness
have
told
you
the
truth
his
opposition
is
temporary
when
you
are
my
wife
he
will
be
to
you
as
to
any
wife
i
could
have
chosen
i
am
convinced
of
it
more
than
ever
i
entreat
you
to
wait
only
till
his
return
to
england
if
you
fail
then
i
will
resist
no
longer
show
him
this
much
respect
dearest
join
him
abroad
now
let
him
see
that
you
desire
his
kindness
is
he
not
disappointed
that
you
mean
to
break
off
your
career
at
oxford
why
should
you
do
that
you
promised
me
did
you
not
promise
me
wilfrid
that
you
would
go
on
to
the
end
can
not
i
have
no
longer
the
calmness
no
longer
the
old
ambitions
how
trivial
they
were
yet
there
will
come
a
day
when
you
will
regret
that
you
left
your
course
unfinished
just
because
you
fell
in
love
with
a
foolish
girl
not
speak
like
that
emily
i
hate
that
way
of
regarding
love
my
passion
for
you
is
henceforth
my
life
if
it
is
trifling
so
is
my
whole
being
my
whole
existence
there
is
no
sacrifice
possible
for
me
that
i
should
ever
regret
our
love
is
what
we
choose
to
make
it
regard
it
as
a
foolish
pastime
and
we
are
no
better
than
the
vulgar
crowd
we
know
how
they
speak
of
it
what
detestable
thoughts
your
words
brought
to
my
mind
have
you
not
heard
men
and
women
those
who
have
outlived
such
glimpses
of
high
things
as
nature
ever
sent
them
making
a
jest
of
love
in
young
lives
treating
it
from
the
height
of
their
wisdom
forsooth
as
a
silly
dream
of
boys
and
girls
if
we
ever
live
to
speak
or
think
like
that
it
will
indeed
be
time
to
have
done
with
the
world
even
as
i
love
you
now
my
heart
darling
i
shall
love
you
when
years
of
intimacy
are
like
some
happy
journey
behind
us
and
on
into
the
very
portal
of
death
regret
how
paltry
all
will
seem
that
was
not
of
the
essence
of
our
love
and
who
knows
how
short
our
time
may
be
when
the
end
comes
will
it
be
easy
to
bear
the
thought
that
we
lost
one
day
one
moment
of
union
out
of
respect
for
idle
prejudices
which
vanish
as
soon
as
they
find
themselves
ineffectual
will
not
the
longest
life
be
all
too
short
for
us
me
the
words
dear
love
is
no
less
sacred
to
me
her
senses
were
playing
the
traitor
or
which
you
will
were
seconding
love
triumph
shall
come
home
with
you
now
he
said
will
let
me
why
was
he
not
content
to
win
her
promise
this
proposal
by
reminding
her
most
strongly
of
the
inevitable
difficulties
her
marriage
would
entail
forced
her
again
into
resistance
now
wilfrid
i
have
not
said
a
word
of
this
i
must
prepare
them
for
it
have
not
spoken
of
me
would
not
do
so
till
i
till
everything
was
more
certain
he
cried
impatiently
do
you
torture
me
so
emily
what
uncertainty
is
there
everything
is
uncertain
if
you
like
to
make
it
so
is
there
something
in
your
mind
that
i
do
not
understand
must
remember
wilfrid
that
this
is
a
strange
new
thing
in
my
life
it
has
come
to
me
so
suddenly
that
even
yet
i
can
not
make
it
part
of
my
familiar
self
it
has
been
impossible
to
speak
of
it
to
others
you
think
i
take
it
as
a
matter
of
course
is
your
love
less
a
magic
gift
to
me
i
wake
in
a
terror
lest
i
have
only
dreamed
of
it
but
then
the
very
truth
comes
back
and
shall
i
make
myself
miserable
with
imagining
uncertainties
when
there
need
be
none
emily
hesitated
before
speaking
again
have
told
you
very
little
about
my
home
she
said
know
that
we
are
very
poor
she
could
not
say
it
as
simply
as
she
wished
she
was
angry
with
herself
to
recognise
how
nearly
her
feeling
was
one
of
shame
what
a
long
habit
of
reason
it
needed
to
expel
the
unintelligent
prejudice
which
the
world
bestows
at
birth
could
almost
say
i
am
glad
of
it
wilfrid
replied
shall
have
it
in
our
power
you
and
i
to
help
so
much
are
many
reasons
she
continued
too
much
occupied
with
her
thoughts
to
dwell
on
what
he
said
i
should
have
time
to
prepare
my
father
and
mother
you
will
let
me
write
the
things
which
it
is
not
very
easy
to
say
what
you
will
and
keep
silence
on
what
you
will
emily
i
can
not
give
so
much
consequence
to
these
external
things
you
and
i
are
living
souls
and
as
such
we
judge
each
other
shall
i
fret
about
the
circumstances
in
which
chance
has
cased
your
life
as
reasonable
if
i
withdrew
my
love
from
you
because
one
day
the
colour
of
your
glove
did
not
please
me
time
you
need
you
shall
have
it
a
week
ten
days
then
i
will
come
myself
and
fetch
you
or
you
shall
come
to
london
alone
as
you
please
it
be
till
your
father
returns
he
will
be
two
months
away
will
join
him
in
switzerland
your
health
requires
it
health
oh
how
tired
i
am
of
that
word
spare
it
me
you
at
least
emily
i
am
well
in
body
and
mind
your
love
would
have
raised
me
if
i
had
lain
at
the
point
of
death
i
can
not
leave
england
alone
i
have
made
up
my
mind
that
you
shall
go
with
me
have
i
then
no
power
to
persuade
you
you
will
not
indeed
refuse
he
looked
at
her
almost
in
despair
he
had
not
anticipated
more
than
the
natural
hesitancy
which
he
would
at
once
overcome
by
force
of
passion
there
was
something
terrible
to
him
in
the
disclosure
of
a
quiet
force
of
will
equal
to
his
own
frustration
of
desire
joined
with
irritated
instincts
of
ascendency
to
agitate
him
almost
beyond
endurance
emily
gazed
at
him
with
pleading
as
passionate
as
his
own
need
you
distrust
me
he
asked
suddenly
overcome
with
an
intolerable
suspicion
at
the
same
moment
he
dropped
her
hand
and
his
gaze
grew
cold
you
she
could
not
think
that
she
understood
him
you
fear
to
come
to
london
with
me
her
bosom
heaved
with
passionate
resentment
of
his
thought
how
you
understand
my
motives
she
asked
with
tremulous
subdued
earnestness
fixing
upon
him
a
gaze
which
he
could
not
meet
he
answered
below
his
breath
a
moment
when
love
of
you
has
made
me
mad
he
turned
away
leaning
with
one
hand
upon
the
trunk
in
the
silence
which
followed
he
appeared
to
be
examining
the
shapeless
ruins
which
from
this
point
of
view
stood
out
boldly
against
the
sky
was
this
castle
destroyed
he
asked
presently
in
a
steady
voice
he
received
no
answer
and
turned
his
eyes
to
her
again
emily
face
was
strung
into
a
hard
intensity
he
laid
his
hand
once
more
upon
hers
and
spoke
with
do
not
know
the
strength
of
a
man
love
in
that
moment
it
touched
the
borders
of
hate
i
know
that
your
mind
is
incapable
of
such
a
suspicion
try
to
think
what
it
meant
to
be
possessed
for
an
instant
by
such
frenzy
felt
able
to
hate
me
she
said
with
a
shake
in
her
voice
which
might
have
become
either
a
laugh
or
a
sob
there
are
things
in
love
that
i
shall
never
know
your
soul
is
pure
as
that
of
the
angels
they
dream
of
i
could
not
love
yen
so
terribly
if
you
were
not
that
perfection
of
womanhood
to
which
all
being
is
drawn
send
me
to
do
your
bidding
i
will
have
no
will
but
yours
how
the
light
of
rapture
flashed
athwart
her
face
it
was
hard
for
her
to
find
words
that
would
not
seem
too
positive
too
insubmissive
till
you
have
lived
with
your
father
in
the
thought
of
this
thing
she
murmured
until
i
have
taught
myself
to
bear
my
happiness
are
we
not
one
already
dear
why
should
you
needlessly
make
your
life
poorer
by
the
loss
if
only
for
a
time
of
all
the
old
kindnesses
i
think
i
know
that
in
a
few
days
your
mind
will
be
the
same
as
my
own
do
you
remember
how
long
it
is
since
we
first
spoke
to
each
other
so
many
days
as
make
a
week
he
answered
smiling
not
that
hard
to
believe
and
hard
to
realise
that
the
new
world
is
still
within
the
old
still
eyes
give
to
me
seine
of
your
wisdom
but
you
have
a
terrible
way
of
teaching
calmness
will
go
straight
to
the
continent
wilfrid
with
one
promise
that
will
bow
to
my
judgment
when
i
return
fate
shall
be
in
your
hands
they
talked
still
while
the
shadows
of
the
ruins
moved
ever
towards
them
all
the
afternoon
no
footsteps
had
come
near
it
was
the
sight
of
two
strangers
which
at
length
bade
emily
think
of
the
time
it
was
after
six
i
must
go
my
absence
will
seem
so
strange
what
fables
i
shall
have
to
invent
on
the
way
home
do
you
know
of
any
train
that
you
can
leave
by
it
matters
very
little
i
suppose
there
is
a
mail
some
time
i
will
go
back
to
dunfield
and
take
my
chance
tired
you
will
be
two
such
journeys
in
one
day
a
draught
of
the
water
of
life
between
them
but
even
now
there
is
something
more
i
ask
for
more
touch
of
the
lips
that
speak
so
nobly
it
was
only
then
that
her
eyes
gleamed
for
a
moment
through
moisture
but
she
strengthened
herself
to
face
the
parting
in
spite
of
a
heaviness
at
the
heart
like
that
which
she
had
felt
on
leaving
the
firs
she
meant
at
first
to
go
no
further
than
the
stile
into
the
lane
and
there
wilfrid
held
out
his
hand
she
used
it
to
aid
herself
in
stepping
over
must
go
as
far
as
pendal
station
she
said
you
can
look
at
the
and
tell
me
what
train
you
will
take
they
walked
the
length
of
the
lane
almost
in
silence
glancing
at
each
other
once
or
twice
at
the
village
station
wilfrid
discovered
that
a
good
train
left
dunfield
shortly
after
nine
from
pendal
to
dunfield
there
would
be
a
train
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
stood
together
under
the
station
shed
no
other
passenger
was
waiting
and
the
official
had
not
yet
arrived
to
open
the
shall
i
hear
from
you
emily
asked
putting
off
from
instant
to
instant
the
which
grew
ever
harder
to
say
less
than
a
week
i
shall
leave
london
early
tomorrow
morning
it
will
give
you
no
time
for
rest
am
not
able
to
rest
go
as
often
as
you
can
to
the
castle
that
i
may
think
of
you
as
sitting
there
will
go
very
often
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
utter
more
than
a
few
words
as
she
spoke
the
appeared
they
moved
away
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
by
which
emily
had
to
leave
shall
see
your
train
as
it
passes
pendal
she
said
then
there
was
the
clasp
of
hands
and
to
emily
the
way
was
dark
before
her
as
she
hurried
onward
mrs
hood
had
subsided
into
the
calm
of
hitter
resignation
emily
found
her
in
the
kitchen
engaged
in
polishing
certain
metal
articles
an
occupation
to
which
she
always
had
recourse
when
the
legitimate
work
of
the
day
was
pretty
well
over
years
ago
mrs
hood
had
not
lacked
interest
in
certain
kinds
of
reading
but
the
miseries
of
her
life
had
killed
all
that
the
need
of
mechanical
exertion
was
constantly
upon
her
an
automatic
conscience
refused
to
allow
her
repose
when
she
heard
emily
entering
by
the
front
door
a
sickly
smile
fixed
itself
upon
her
lips
and
with
this
she
silently
greeted
the
girl
is
too
bad
of
me
mother
emily
said
trying
to
assume
playfulness
which
contrasted
strangely
with
an
almost
haggard
weariness
on
her
face
will
give
me
up
as
hopeless
i
will
promise
like
the
children
that
it
shall
never
happen
again
is
your
holiday
my
dear
was
the
reply
as
mrs
hood
went
to
stir
the
fire
must
amuse
yourself
in
your
own
way
course
you
have
had
tea
i
really
want
nothing
till
was
not
worth
while
to
make
tea
for
one
said
her
mother
with
a
sigh
you
have
had
none
then
i
will
make
it
this
minute
when
will
father
be
home
is
quite
uncertain
he
gets
more
and
more
irregular
should
he
be
kept
so
beyond
the
proper
time
it
is
really
too
bad
dear
your
father
is
never
satisfied
with
doing
his
own
work
always
taking
somebody
else
as
well
of
course
they
find
that
out
and
they
put
upon
him
i
talked
and
talked
but
it
no
use
i
suppose
it
go
on
in
the
same
way
to
the
end
half
an
hour
later
mr
hood
reached
home
as
usual
worn
out
the
last
half
mile
of
the
walk
from
dunfield
was
always
a
struggle
with
exhaustion
he
had
to
sit
several
minutes
before
he
was
able
to
go
upstairs
to
refresh
himself
with
cold
water
met
cartwright
he
said
when
an
unexpected
cup
of
tea
from
emily
hands
had
put
him
into
good
spirits
got
home
on
saturday
and
wants
you
to
go
and
see
her
emily
i
half
promised
you
would
call
morning
i
will
said
emily
do
think
it
altogether
right
remarked
mrs
hood
emily
should
have
to
work
in
her
holidays
and
i
sure
it
all
no
use
jessie
cartwright
will
never
do
any
good
if
she
has
lessons
from
now
to
doomsday
it
very
necessary
she
should
replied
mr
hood
ever
they
live
as
they
do
passes
my
comprehension
there
was
cartwright
taking
home
fruit
and
flowers
which
cost
a
pretty
penny
i
be
bound
and
her
talk
i
thought
i
should
never
get
away
there
one
thing
she
never
has
any
but
gossip
i
never
leave
her
without
feeling
that
she
is
one
of
the
women
i
know
ca
say
that
her
daughters
take
after
her
mrs
hood
remarked
soothed
as
always
by
comment
upon
her
acquaintances
was
here
the
other
afternoon
and
all
the
time
she
never
ceased
making
fun
of
those
poor
wilkinses
it
really
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
from
telling
her
she
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
mary
wilkins
at
all
events
makes
no
pretences
she
may
be
plain
but
she
a
good
girl
and
stays
at
home
to
do
what
required
of
her
as
for
the
cartwright
girls
well
we
shall
see
what
happen
some
day
it
ca
go
on
that
quite
certain
do
think
there
any
real
harm
in
them
they
thoughtless
but
then
they
very
young
they
ought
to
have
so
much
of
their
own
way
what
your
opinion
of
jessie
emily
do
you
think
she
ever
be
fit
to
teach
might
if
she
could
live
apart
from
her
mother
and
sisters
for
a
time
i
think
she
have
to
come
here
for
her
lessons
it
out
of
the
question
to
do
anything
at
that
house
it
was
mr
hood
habit
to
spend
his
evenings
in
a
little
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
which
he
called
his
laboratory
it
was
furnished
with
a
deal
table
a
couple
of
chairs
and
some
shelves
on
the
table
was
his
apparatus
for
the
study
of
electricity
mostly
the
product
of
his
own
ingenuity
also
a
number
of
retorts
crucibles
and
the
like
wherewith
he
experimented
chemically
the
shelves
exhibited
bottles
and
jars
and
the
dozen
or
so
volumes
which
made
his
scientific
library
these
tastes
he
had
kept
up
from
boyhood
there
was
something
pathetic
in
the
persistency
with
which
he
clung
to
the
pretence
of
serious
study
though
the
physical
fatigue
which
possessed
him
during
his
few
hours
of
freedom
would
in
any
case
have
condemned
him
to
mere
trifling
often
he
came
upstairs
lit
his
lamp
and
sat
for
a
couple
of
hours
doing
nothing
more
than
play
with
his
instruments
much
as
a
child
might
at
other
times
a
sudden
revival
of
zeal
would
declare
itself
and
he
would
read
and
experiment
till
late
in
the
night
always
in
fear
of
the
inevitable
lecture
on
his
reckless
waste
of
in
the
winter
time
the
temperature
of
this
garret
was
arctic
and
fireplace
there
was
none
still
he
could
not
intermit
his
custom
of
spending
at
least
an
hour
in
what
he
called
scientific
study
with
the
result
that
he
went
to
bed
numbed
and
shivering
it
was
but
another
illustration
of
possibilities
rendered
futile
by
circumstances
it
was
more
than
likely
that
the
man
might
with
fair
treatment
have
really
done
something
in
one
or
other
branch
of
physics
to
emily
who
strove
to
interest
herself
in
his
subjects
out
of
mere
love
and
compassion
he
appeared
to
have
gained
not
a
little
knowledge
of
facts
and
theories
she
liked
to
encourage
herself
in
the
faith
that
his
attainments
were
solid
as
far
as
they
went
and
that
they
might
have
been
the
foundation
of
good
independent
work
it
helped
her
to
respect
her
father
you
come
up
emily
he
asked
with
the
diffidence
which
he
always
put
into
this
request
she
assented
with
apparent
cheerfulness
and
they
climbed
the
stairs
together
the
last
portion
of
them
was
uncarpeted
and
their
footsteps
sounded
with
hollow
echoes
under
the
roof
it
was
all
but
dark
by
this
time
mr
hood
found
matches
on
the
table
and
lit
the
lamp
which
illuminated
the
bare
whitewashed
walls
and
sloping
ceiling
with
a
dreary
dimness
there
was
no
carpet
on
the
floor
which
creaked
as
they
moved
here
and
there
when
her
father
was
on
the
point
of
drawing
down
the
blind
emily
interposed
you
mind
leaving
it
up
father
course
i
will
he
assented
with
a
smile
why
last
daylight
in
the
sky
is
pleasant
to
look
at
on
the
landing
below
stood
an
old
clock
so
much
service
had
it
seen
that
its
voice
was
grown
faint
and
the
strokes
of
each
hour
that
it
gave
forth
were
wheezed
with
intervals
of
several
seconds
it
was
now
striking
nine
and
the
succession
of
ghostly
notes
seemed
interminable
the
last
daylight
how
often
our
lightest
words
are
omens
faded
out
of
the
sky
emily
kept
her
eyes
upon
the
windows
none
the
less
she
tried
to
understand
what
her
father
was
saying
sufficiently
to
put
in
a
word
now
and
then
but
her
sense
of
hearing
was
strained
to
its
utmost
for
other
sounds
there
was
no
traffic
in
the
road
below
and
the
house
itself
was
hushed
the
ticking
of
the
old
clock
performed
with
such
painful
effort
that
it
ever
seemed
on
the
point
of
failing
was
the
only
sign
of
life
outside
the
garret
at
length
emily
ear
caught
a
remote
rushing
sound
her
father
low
voice
did
not
overcome
it
compounds
of
nitrogen
and
oxygen
he
was
saying
very
interesting
nitrous
oxide
you
know
is
what
they
call
laughing
gas
you
heat
solid
nitrate
of
ammonia
and
that
makes
protoxide
of
nitrogen
and
water
the
words
conveyed
no
sense
to
her
though
she
heard
them
the
rushing
sound
had
become
a
dull
continuous
thunder
her
eyes
strained
into
the
darkness
of
a
sudden
the
horizon
flamed
a
train
was
passing
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
and
the
of
the
engine
had
just
been
opened
to
feed
the
fire
whose
strength
sped
the
carriages
to
london
a
streaming
cloud
of
smoke
reflected
the
glare
it
was
as
though
some
flying
dragon
vomited
crimson
fumes
involuntarily
the
girl
half
rose
from
her
seat
and
pointed
is
it
asked
her
father
looking
round
pretty
sight
that
fire
on
the
smoke
well
this
protoxide
of
nitrogen
you
see
chapter
vii
on
the
levels
not
the
least
of
many
mysteries
in
the
natural
history
of
the
cartwrights
was
how
they
all
managed
to
bestow
themselves
in
the
house
which
they
occupied
to
be
sure
the
family
omitting
cartwright
seldom
at
home
were
all
of
one
sex
which
perhaps
made
the
difficulty
less
insuperable
but
the
fact
remained
that
cartwright
and
her
five
daughters
together
with
a
lived
moved
and
had
their
being
in
an
abode
consisting
of
six
rooms
a
cellar
and
a
lumber
closet
a
few
years
ago
they
had
occupied
a
much
more
roomy
dwelling
on
the
edge
of
the
aristocratic
region
of
dunfield
though
not
strictly
in
luke
the
belgravia
of
the
town
they
of
course
spoke
of
it
as
if
it
were
a
crisis
in
the
fortunes
of
the
family
had
necessitated
a
reduction
of
their
establishment
the
district
in
which
they
now
dwelt
was
humbler
but
then
it
could
always
be
described
as
north
parade
you
know
north
parade
being
an
equivalent
of
mayfair
the
uppermost
windows
commanded
a
view
of
the
extensive
of
a
long
railway
viaduct
and
of
hilly
fields
beyond
the
five
misses
cartwright
did
not
greatly
relish
the
change
they
were
disposed
even
to
resist
to
hold
their
ground
on
the
verge
of
luke
to
toll
their
father
that
he
must
do
his
duty
and
still
maintain
them
in
that
station
of
life
for
which
they
were
clearly
designed
by
providence
but
cartwright
after
many
cries
of
found
himself
veritably
at
close
quarters
with
the
animal
and
female
argument
had
to
yield
to
the
logic
of
fact
thankful
exclaimed
the
paterfamilias
when
his
long
patience
came
to
an
end
we
have
all
to
go
to
the
union
it
come
to
that
yet
mark
my
word
and
indeed
few
people
in
dunfield
would
have
expressed
surprise
at
the
actual
incidence
of
this
calamity
cartwright
was
ostensibly
a
commercial
traveller
but
obviously
he
must
have
joined
with
this
main
pursuit
many
odds
and
ends
of
activity
seeing
that
the
family
kept
out
of
debt
and
still
indulged
themselves
in
extravagances
which
many
substantial
households
would
have
declared
themselves
unable
to
afford
if
the
town
were
visited
by
an
opera
company
or
by
some
dramatic
star
going
the
round
of
the
provinces
the
cartwrights
were
sure
to
have
prominent
seats
and
to
exhibit
themselves
in
becoming
costume
if
a
bazaar
were
held
their
was
always
forthcoming
at
flower
shows
galas
croquet
parties
they
challenged
comparison
with
all
who
were
not
confessedly
of
the
dunfield
they
regularly
adorned
their
pew
in
the
parish
church
were
liberal
at
offertories
exerted
themselves
not
without
expense
in
the
sunday
school
feast
and
the
like
how
cried
all
dunfield
how
in
the
name
of
wonder
was
it
done
we
are
not
concerned
to
probe
the
mystery
suffice
it
that
the
situation
be
exhibited
as
it
appeared
to
the
eyes
of
the
world
when
the
crisis
declared
itself
though
every
one
enjoyed
the
opportunity
of
exclaiming
told
you
so
there
were
few
who
did
not
feel
really
sorry
for
the
cartwrights
so
little
of
envy
mingled
with
the
incessant
gossip
of
which
the
family
were
the
subject
cartwright
was
held
in
more
or
less
affection
by
every
one
who
knew
her
she
was
a
woman
of
fifty
of
substantial
frame
florid
and
somewhat
masculine
in
manner
a
thorough
her
tone
and
demeanour
were
marked
by
a
frank
which
often
exaggerated
itself
into
bluffness
and
was
never
consistent
with
the
delicacy
of
refined
taste
but
which
unmistakably
evinced
a
sound
and
benevolent
disposition
when
her
sharp
temper
was
stirred
and
her
daughters
gave
it
abundant
exercise
she
expressed
herself
in
a
racy
and
vigorous
vernacular
which
there
was
no
opposing
never
coarse
never
in
the
large
sense
unwomanly
she
made
her
predominance
felt
with
an
emphasis
which
would
fain
have
been
rivalled
by
many
of
the
mothers
of
dunfield
lavishly
indulgent
to
her
girls
she
yet
kept
them
thoroughly
in
hand
and
won
if
not
their
tenderness
at
all
events
their
affection
and
respect
the
girls
themselves
were
not
outwardly
charming
jessie
the
youngest
but
one
had
perhaps
a
certain
claim
to
prettiness
but
like
all
her
sisters
she
was
of
coarse
type
their
education
had
been
of
the
most
haphazard
kind
their
breeding
was
not
a
little
defective
but
a
certain
tact
common
to
the
family
enabled
them
to
make
the
very
most
of
themselves
so
that
they
more
than
passed
muster
among
the
young
ladies
of
the
town
as
long
as
they
sojourned
on
the
borders
of
luke
nothing
was
farther
from
the
thoughts
of
any
one
of
them
than
the
idea
that
they
might
have
to
exert
themselves
to
earn
their
own
living
it
was
only
of
late
that
certain
emphatic
representations
on
the
part
of
their
father
had
led
cartwright
to
consider
which
of
the
girls
was
good
for
anything
amy
the
eldest
had
rather
a
weak
constitution
it
was
plain
that
neither
in
body
nor
in
mind
could
she
be
called
upon
to
exert
herself
eleanor
who
came
next
had
musical
faculties
after
terrific
family
debates
it
was
decided
that
she
must
give
lessons
on
the
piano
and
a
first
pupil
was
speedily
found
barbara
was
good
for
nothing
whatever
save
to
spend
money
on
her
personal
adornment
considering
that
she
was
the
plainest
of
the
family
her
sisters
having
repeatedly
decided
the
point
her
existence
appeared
on
the
whole
singularly
superfluous
then
came
jessie
of
jessie
her
father
had
repeatedly
said
that
she
was
the
only
girl
of
his
who
had
brains
those
brains
if
existent
must
now
be
turned
to
account
but
jessie
had
long
since
torn
up
her
into
and
as
learning
accumulated
outside
her
head
it
vanished
from
the
interior
when
she
declared
that
arithmetic
was
all
but
a
mystery
to
her
and
that
she
had
forgotten
what
french
she
ever
knew
there
was
an
unprecedented
outbreak
of
parental
wrath
this
was
the
result
of
all
that
had
been
spent
on
her
education
she
must
get
it
back
as
best
she
could
for
as
sure
as
fate
she
should
be
packed
off
as
a
governess
look
at
emily
hood
why
that
girl
was
keeping
herself
and
most
likely
paying
her
butcher
bill
into
the
bargain
and
her
advantages
had
been
fewer
than
jessie
after
storms
beyond
description
jessie
did
what
her
mother
called
to
but
progress
was
slight
must
get
emily
hood
to
help
you
when
she
comes
home
for
her
holidays
was
hopeful
suggestion
one
night
that
the
girl
had
fairly
broken
down
and
given
way
to
sobs
and
tears
emily
was
written
to
and
promised
aid
the
remaining
daughter
geraldine
was
held
to
be
too
young
as
yet
for
responsible
undertakings
she
was
only
seventeen
and
besides
there
was
something
rather
hopeful
going
on
between
her
and
young
baldwin
the
solicitor
who
had
just
begun
practice
in
dunfield
so
that
on
the
whole
geraldine
lot
looked
the
most
promising
of
all
in
previous
years
the
family
had
never
failed
to
betake
themselves
for
three
weeks
or
so
to
scarborough
or
whitby
or
bridlington
this
year
they
had
for
the
first
time
contented
themselves
with
humbler
recreation
cartwright
and
four
of
the
girls
managed
a
week
at
ilkley
jessie
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
invited
to
stay
for
a
fortnight
with
friends
at
the
seaside
she
was
the
latest
to
return
emily
being
now
at
home
there
was
no
longer
an
excuse
for
postponing
study
books
were
procured
and
jessie
by
way
of
preparation
endeavoured
to
fathom
the
abysses
of
her
ignorance
we
have
heard
emily
opinion
as
to
the
possibility
of
studious
application
in
the
house
of
the
cartwrights
her
own
visits
thither
were
made
as
few
as
possible
she
declared
that
she
never
came
away
without
a
headache
in
spite
of
restricted
space
the
cartwrights
found
it
impossible
to
relinquish
the
habit
of
universal
hospitality
as
if
discontented
with
the
narrow
proportions
of
her
own
family
cartwright
was
never
thoroughly
at
ease
unless
she
had
three
or
four
friends
to
occupy
every
available
square
foot
of
floor
in
her
diminutive
and
to
squeeze
around
the
table
when
meals
were
served
in
vain
did
acquaintances
hold
apart
from
a
sense
of
consideration
or
time
their
visits
when
eating
and
drinking
could
scarcely
be
in
question
they
were
given
plainly
to
understand
that
their
delicacy
was
an
offence
and
that
if
they
stayed
away
it
would
be
put
down
to
their
pride
it
was
almost
impossible
to
hit
an
hour
for
calling
at
which
the
family
would
be
alone
generally
as
soon
as
the
front
door
opened
the
ear
of
the
visitor
was
assailed
with
laughter
loud
and
long
with
multitudinous
vociferation
cartwright
rich
voice
high
above
all
others
the
room
itself
was
a
spectacle
for
men
and
gods
not
a
member
of
the
family
had
the
most
rudimentary
instinct
of
order
no
article
whether
of
ornament
or
use
had
its
recognised
station
needlework
lay
in
heaps
on
table
chairs
and
floor
you
stretched
out
your
legs
too
far
and
came
in
contact
with
a
casual
put
down
to
be
out
of
the
way
you
desired
to
open
the
piano
and
had
first
to
remove
a
tray
of
wineglasses
to
listen
to
the
girls
conversation
for
five
minutes
was
to
understand
their
surroundings
they
were
hopelessly
they
chattered
and
gabbled
with
deafening
persistency
if
there
was
no
good
in
their
talk
there
could
scarcely
be
said
to
be
any
harm
they
lived
so
completely
on
the
surface
of
things
that
they
impressed
one
as
incapable
even
of
a
doubtful
thought
one
reason
why
geraldine
was
the
only
one
who
had
yet
definitely
attracted
a
male
admirer
might
lie
in
the
fact
that
there
was
no
air
of
femininity
about
the
girls
nothing
whatever
to
touch
the
most
susceptible
imagination
a
parcel
of
schoolboys
would
have
been
as
provocative
and
this
notwithstanding
that
they
talked
incessantly
of
of
flirtations
of
the
making
and
breaking
of
matches
it
was
the
very
freedom
and
shallowness
of
such
gossip
that
made
it
wholly
unexciting
their
mother
presence
put
no
check
on
the
talk
she
indeed
was
very
much
like
her
daughters
in
choice
of
subject
and
the
young
men
who
frequented
the
house
joined
in
discussion
of
sexual
entanglements
with
a
disengaged
air
which
if
it
impugned
their
delicacy
at
all
events
seemed
to
testify
to
practical
innocence
those
young
men
dunfield
was
at
that
time
not
perhaps
worse
off
in
its
supply
of
marriageable
males
than
other
small
provincial
towns
but
to
judge
from
the
extensive
assortment
which
passed
through
the
cartwrights
house
the
lot
of
dunfield
maidens
might
beheld
pathetic
they
were
not
especially
ignorant
or
vulgar
these
budding
townsmen
simply
imbecile
one
could
not
accuse
them
of
positive
faults
for
they
had
no
positive
qualities
unless
it
were
here
and
there
a
leaning
to
physical
fatuity
their
interests
were
concerned
with
the
pettiest
of
local
occurrences
their
favouritisms
and
animosities
were
those
of
overgrown
infants
they
played
practical
jokes
on
each
other
in
the
open
streets
they
read
the
local
newspapers
to
extract
the
feeblest
of
gossip
they
had
a
game
which
they
called
polities
and
which
consisted
in
badging
themselves
with
blue
or
yellow
according
to
the
choice
of
their
fathers
before
them
they
affected
now
and
then
to
haunt
and
and
made
good
resolutions
when
they
had
smoked
or
drunk
more
than
their
stomachs
would
support
if
any
dunfield
schoolboy
exhibited
faculties
of
a
kind
uncommon
in
the
town
he
was
despatched
to
begin
life
on
a
more
promising
scene
those
who
remained
who
became
the
new
generation
of
business
men
of
town
councillors
of
independent
electors
were
such
as
could
not
by
any
possibility
have
made
a
living
elsewhere
those
elders
who
knew
dunfield
best
could
not
point
to
a
single
youth
of
fair
endowments
who
looked
forward
to
remaining
in
his
native
place
the
tone
of
dunfield
society
was
not
high
no
wonder
that
emily
hood
had
her
doubts
as
to
the
result
of
study
taken
up
by
one
of
the
cartwrights
still
she
held
it
a
duty
to
give
what
help
she
could
knowing
how
necessary
it
was
that
jessie
should
if
possible
qualify
herself
to
earn
a
living
the
first
thing
after
breakfast
on
tuesday
morning
she
set
forth
to
visit
her
friends
it
was
not
quite
ten
when
she
reached
the
house
and
she
looked
forward
with
some
assurance
of
hope
to
finding
the
family
alone
jessie
herself
opened
the
door
and
emily
passing
at
once
into
the
discovered
that
not
only
had
a
visitor
arrived
before
her
but
this
the
very
person
she
would
most
have
desired
to
avoid
richard
dagworthy
was
seated
in
conversation
with
cartwright
and
her
daughters
or
rather
he
had
been
conversing
till
emily
arrival
caused
a
momentary
silence
he
had
called
thus
early
on
his
way
to
the
mill
to
inquire
for
cartwright
present
address
having
occasion
to
communicate
with
him
on
business
matters
the
room
was
so
small
that
emily
had
a
difficulty
in
reaching
cartwright
to
shake
hands
with
her
owing
to
dagworthy
almost
blocking
the
only
available
way
round
the
table
he
stood
up
and
drew
back
waiting
his
turn
for
greeting
when
it
came
he
assumed
the
manner
of
an
old
friend
a
chair
was
found
for
emily
and
conversation
or
what
passed
for
such
speedily
regathered
volume
the
breakfast
things
were
still
on
the
table
and
miss
geraldine
who
was
always
reluctant
to
rise
of
a
morning
was
engaged
upon
her
meal
see
what
it
come
to
dagworthy
exclaimed
the
mother
of
the
family
with
her
usual
lack
of
reticence
ca
or
wo
learn
by
herself
so
she
has
to
bother
emily
to
come
and
teach
her
it
too
bad
i
call
it
just
in
her
holiday
time
she
looks
as
if
she
wanted
to
run
about
and
get
colour
in
her
cheeks
do
think
so
mother
cried
jessie
need
speak
as
if
emily
was
a
child
in
short
clothes
the
other
girls
laughed
dare
say
emily
wishes
she
was
pursued
cartwright
little
ones
you
all
for
being
grown
up
and
when
you
grown
up
then
you
see
how
much
better
off
you
were
before
that
is
if
got
common
sense
i
wish
my
girls
had
half
as
much
all
put
together
as
emily
has
sure
i
do
wish
i
was
a
child
remarked
geraldine
as
she
bit
her
course
you
do
geraldine
replied
dagworthy
who
was
on
terms
of
much
familiarity
with
all
the
girls
you
were
your
mother
let
you
come
down
late
to
breakfast
would
she
never
remember
being
in
time
for
breakfast
since
i
was
born
cried
the
girl
dare
say
your
memory
does
go
far
enough
back
rejoined
dagworthy
with
the
smile
of
one
who
trifled
from
a
position
of
superior
age
and
experience
cartwright
laughed
with
a
little
embarrassment
amy
the
eldest
girl
was
quick
with
an
inquiry
whether
emily
had
been
as
yet
to
the
agricultural
show
the
resort
at
present
of
all
dunfieldians
emily
replied
that
she
had
not
and
to
this
subject
the
talk
strayed
dagworthy
had
dogs
on
exhibition
at
the
show
barbara
wanted
to
know
how
much
he
would
take
for
a
certain
animal
which
had
captivated
her
if
she
had
some
idea
that
this
might
lead
to
an
offer
of
the
dog
as
a
present
she
was
doomed
to
disappointment
for
dagworthy
named
his
price
in
the
most
way
but
nothing
had
excited
so
much
interest
in
these
young
ladies
as
the
prize
pigs
they
were
in
raptures
at
the
incredible
degree
of
fatness
attained
they
delighted
to
recall
that
some
of
the
pigs
were
fattened
to
such
a
point
that
rollers
had
to
be
placed
under
their
throats
to
keep
their
heads
up
and
prevent
them
from
being
choked
by
the
pressure
of
their
own
superabundant
flesh
in
all
this
conversation
dagworthy
took
his
part
but
not
quite
with
the
same
freedom
as
before
emily
arrival
his
eyes
turned
incessantly
in
her
direction
and
once
or
twice
he
only
just
saved
himself
from
when
a
remark
was
addressed
to
him
it
was
with
obvious
reluctance
that
he
at
length
rose
to
leave
are
you
all
coming
to
see
me
he
asked
as
he
stood
smoothing
his
felt
hat
with
the
back
of
his
hand
suppose
i
shall
have
to
give
a
croquet
party
and
have
some
of
the
young
fellows
then
you
come
fast
enough
old
men
like
myself
you
care
nothing
about
should
think
not
indeed
replied
barbara
the
plain
your
hair
going
grey
if
you
did
shave
you
have
had
grey
whiskers
long
ago
i
invite
the
others
he
returned
laughing
may
consider
yourself
excepted
amid
delicate
banter
of
this
kind
he
took
his
departure
of
course
he
was
instantly
the
subject
of
clamorous
chatter
he
really
give
a
croquet
party
demanded
one
eagerly
he
was
the
reply
from
another
would
cost
him
too
much
in
tea
and
cakes
put
in
cartwright
does
care
for
society
what
it
is
i
believe
he
a
good
deal
happier
living
there
by
himself
than
he
was
when
his
wife
was
alive
is
very
wonderful
exclaimed
amy
proud
thing
she
was
served
him
right
if
she
made
him
uncomfortable
he
only
married
her
because
her
people
were
grand
do
believe
they
ever
go
near
him
now
said
the
mother
did
they
quarrel
about
mother
asked
jessie
believe
he
used
his
wife
badly
that
the
truth
of
it
do
know
what
the
truth
of
it
is
returned
her
mother
contemptuously
know
very
well
he
did
nothing
of
the
kind
whatever
his
faults
are
he
not
that
sort
of
man
you
must
confess
mother
he
downright
mean
and
you
often
enough
said
dagworthy
spent
more
money
than
pleased
him
i
know
very
well
i
should
like
to
be
his
wife
wait
till
he
asks
you
jessie
cried
barbara
with
sisterly
reproof
do
suppose
he
very
likely
to
ask
any
of
you
said
cartwright
with
a
laugh
which
was
not
very
hearty
geraldine
are
you
going
to
have
done
your
breakfast
here
ten
and
you
seem
as
if
you
never
stop
eating
i
wo
have
this
irregularity
now
tomorrow
morning
i
have
the
table
cleared
at
nine
and
if
you
not
down
you
go
without
breakfast
altogether
mind
what
i
say
the
threat
was
such
an
old
one
that
geraldine
honoured
it
with
not
the
least
attention
but
helped
herself
abundantly
to
marmalade
which
she
impasted
solidly
on
buttered
toast
and
consumed
with
much
relish
you
got
emily
here
pursued
cartwright
turning
her
attack
upon
jessie
are
you
going
to
do
with
her
are
you
going
to
have
your
lessons
in
this
room
do
know
what
do
say
emily
emily
was
clearly
of
opinion
that
lessons
under
such
conditions
were
likely
to
be
of
small
profit
it
were
not
so
far
she
said
should
propose
that
you
came
to
me
every
other
day
i
should
think
that
will
be
often
enough
it
just
as
far
for
you
to
come
here
exclaimed
cartwright
you
good
enough
to
teach
her
great
lazy
thing
that
she
is
the
least
she
can
do
is
to
save
you
all
the
trouble
she
can
got
an
idea
observed
jessie
should
we
have
lessons
in
the
garden
just
as
bad
emily
have
the
same
distance
to
walk
hear
of
it
emily
you
make
her
come
to
banbrigg
do
in
the
least
mind
the
walk
emily
said
we
might
take
it
in
turns
one
lesson
in
the
garden
and
the
next
at
banbrigg
after
ten
minutes
vociferous
discussion
during
which
emily
held
her
peace
this
plan
was
eventually
agreed
upon
jessie
ran
upstairs
to
prepare
herself
to
go
forth
do
you
let
her
waste
your
time
emily
said
cartwright
in
the
girl
absence
you
see
she
doing
no
good
just
give
it
up
i
do
half
like
the
thought
of
making
you
drudge
in
this
way
in
your
holidays
i
sure
it
very
kind
of
you
to
have
offered
to
do
it
and
it
certain
she
mind
you
more
than
she
would
any
one
else
she
does
care
a
scrap
for
all
i
say
to
her
though
she
knows
well
enough
it
as
much
as
her
father
can
do
to
keep
things
going
at
all
there
never
was
such
bad
times
in
recollection
how
are
things
in
london
did
you
hear
much
complaint
emily
found
it
hard
to
resist
a
smile
at
the
thought
of
athel
or
any
of
those
belonging
to
him
indulging
in
complaints
of
this
nature
what
sort
of
people
are
they
you
got
with
this
time
the
other
went
on
to
ask
they
treat
you
well
well
indeed
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
a
stranger
comparing
emily
her
tone
and
bearing
with
the
members
of
the
cartwright
family
to
believe
that
she
came
of
the
same
class
and
had
lived
through
her
girlhood
under
precisely
similar
conditions
so
marked
a
difference
could
not
but
impress
even
the
cartwrights
themselves
the
girls
did
not
behave
with
entire
freedom
in
her
presence
and
influences
to
which
they
were
anything
but
readily
susceptible
were
apparent
in
the
tone
they
adopted
in
addressing
her
in
spite
of
themselves
they
bowed
to
a
superiority
but
vaguely
understood
jessie
perhaps
exhibited
less
of
this
instinctive
reverence
than
the
others
although
in
point
of
fact
her
endowments
were
decidedly
above
those
of
her
sisters
the
reason
being
no
doubt
that
acknowledged
precedence
in
intellect
had
fostered
in
her
the
worst
kind
of
the
girl
was
intolerably
conceited
emily
almost
disliked
her
she
would
have
found
it
a
more
agreeable
task
to
endeavour
to
teach
any
one
of
the
more
stupid
sisters
it
was
in
the
certainty
of
a
couple
of
hours
moral
suffering
that
she
left
the
house
with
jessie
the
garden
which
was
to
be
the
scene
of
study
was
ten
minutes
walk
away
from
the
house
to
reach
it
they
had
to
pass
along
a
road
which
traversed
the
cattle
market
a
vast
area
of
pens
filled
on
one
day
in
each
week
with
multitudes
of
oxen
sheep
and
swine
beyond
the
market
and
in
the
shadow
of
the
railway
viaduct
previously
referred
to
lay
three
or
four
acres
of
ground
divided
up
by
hedges
into
small
gardens
leased
by
people
who
had
an
ambition
to
grow
their
own
potatoes
and
cabbages
but
had
no
plot
attached
to
their
houses
jessie
opened
a
rough
wooden
door
made
fast
by
a
padlock
and
closing
it
again
behind
them
led
the
way
along
a
narrow
path
between
high
hedges
a
second
wooden
door
was
reached
which
opened
into
the
garden
itself
this
was
laid
out
with
an
eye
less
to
beauty
than
to
usefulness
in
the
centre
was
a
patch
of
grass
lying
between
two
pear
trees
the
rest
of
the
ground
was
planted
with
the
various
requisites
of
the
kitchen
and
in
one
corner
was
a
well
in
the
tool
house
were
kept
several
windsor
chairs
two
of
these
were
now
brought
forth
and
placed
on
the
grass
between
the
pear
trees
but
jessie
was
not
disposed
to
apply
herself
on
the
instant
to
the
books
which
she
had
brought
in
a
satchel
her
first
occupation
was
to
hunt
for
the
ripest
gooseberries
and
currants
and
to
try
her
teeth
in
several
pears
which
she
knocked
down
with
the
handle
of
a
rake
when
at
length
she
seated
herself
her
tongue
began
to
have
its
way
i
do
dislike
that
mr
dagworthy
she
said
with
transparent
affectation
wonder
what
he
came
for
this
morning
he
said
he
wanted
father
address
but
i
know
that
was
only
an
excuse
he
has
been
to
see
us
for
months
it
was
like
his
impudence
to
ever
come
at
all
after
the
way
he
behaved
when
he
married
that
miss
hanmer
you
tell
me
how
many
of
these
french
exercises
you
have
written
emily
asked
as
soon
as
a
pause
gave
her
the
opportunity
i
do
know
was
the
answer
ten
i
think
do
you
know
i
really
believe
he
thinks
himself
and
he
as
plain
as
he
can
be
do
you
think
so
emily
really
have
no
opinion
was
strange
he
should
come
this
morning
it
was
only
yesterday
i
met
him
over
there
by
the
mill
dagworthy
mill
stood
at
one
end
of
the
you
ca
think
the
impudent
way
he
talked
and
oh
how
did
he
know
that
you
were
going
to
give
me
lessons
ca
say
he
did
know
somehow
i
was
astonished
perhaps
your
father
told
him
is
not
very
likely
he
knew
i
wonder
who
he
marry
next
you
may
depend
upon
it
he
did
treat
his
wife
badly
everybody
said
so
if
he
were
to
propose
to
me
i
should
answer
like
that
woman
did
to
henry
the
eighth
you
know
she
tittered
ca
fancy
marrying
a
man
who
been
married
before
could
you
i
said
that
to
tichborne
one
day
at
bridlington
and
what
do
you
think
she
answered
oh
she
said
they
the
best
husbands
only
a
fool
marries
a
second
time
this
was
the
kind
of
talk
that
emily
knew
she
would
have
to
endure
it
was
unutterably
repugnant
to
her
she
had
observed
in
successive
holidays
the
growth
of
a
spirit
in
jessie
cartwright
more
distinctly
offensive
than
anything
which
declared
itself
in
her
sisters
gabble
however
irritating
that
might
be
the
girl
mind
seemed
to
have
been
sullied
by
some
contact
and
previous
indications
disposed
emily
to
think
that
this
tichborne
was
very
probably
a
source
of
evil
she
was
the
wife
of
an
the
more
vulgar
for
certain
affectations
of
refinement
acquired
during
in
london
and
her
intimacy
with
the
cartwrights
was
now
of
long
standing
it
was
jessie
whom
she
specially
affected
with
her
jessie
had
just
been
spending
a
fortnight
at
the
seaside
the
evil
caught
from
tichborne
or
from
some
one
of
similar
character
did
not
associate
itself
very
naturally
with
the
silly
which
marked
the
girl
she
had
the
air
of
assuming
the
objectionable
tone
as
a
mark
of
cleverness
emily
could
not
trust
herself
to
utter
the
kind
of
comment
which
would
naturally
have
risen
to
her
lips
it
would
be
practically
useless
and
her
relations
to
jessie
were
not
such
as
could
engender
affectionate
zeal
in
a
serious
attempt
to
overcome
evil
influences
emily
was
not
of
the
women
whose
nature
it
is
to
pursue
missionary
enterprise
instead
of
calling
forth
her
energies
a
situation
like
the
present
threw
her
back
upon
herself
she
sought
a
retreat
from
disgust
in
the
sheltered
purity
of
her
own
heart
outwardly
she
became
cold
her
face
expressed
that
severity
which
was
one
side
of
her
character
you
think
it
would
be
better
if
we
made
a
beginning
this
morning
she
said
as
soon
as
another
pause
in
the
flow
of
chatter
gave
her
opportunity
a
one
you
are
for
work
jessie
protested
seem
to
take
to
it
naturally
and
yet
i
sure
it
is
a
natural
thing
just
think
of
having
to
muddle
over
french
grammar
at
my
age
and
i
know
very
well
it
never
come
to
anything
can
you
imagine
me
teaching
i
always
hated
school
and
i
hate
the
thought
of
being
a
governess
it
different
with
you
you
right
down
clever
and
you
make
people
take
an
interest
in
you
but
just
think
of
me
why
i
should
be
thought
no
more
of
than
a
servant
i
suppose
i
should
have
to
make
friends
with
the
milkman
and
the
butcher
boy
i
do
see
who
else
i
should
have
to
talk
to
a
girl
to
get
married
if
she
spends
all
her
time
in
a
nursery
teaching
children
grammar
you
do
seem
to
care
whether
you
ever
married
or
not
but
i
do
and
it
precious
hard
to
have
all
my
chances
taken
away
this
was
jessie
incessant
preoccupation
she
could
not
talk
for
five
minutes
without
returning
to
it
herein
she
only
exaggerated
her
sisters
habits
of
mind
the
girls
had
begun
to
talk
of
and
husbands
before
they
were
well
out
of
the
nursery
in
earlier
years
emily
had
only
laughed
at
what
she
called
such
foolishness
she
could
not
laugh
now
such
ways
of
thinking
and
speaking
were
a
profanation
of
all
she
held
holiest
words
which
she
whispered
in
trembling
to
her
heart
were
vulgarised
and
defiled
by
use
upon
these
tinkling
tongues
it
was
blasphemy
against
her
religion
once
more
she
endeavoured
to
fix
the
girl
thoughts
on
the
work
in
hand
and
by
steady
persistence
conquered
at
length
some
semblance
of
attention
but
an
hour
proved
the
utmost
limit
of
jessie
patience
then
her
tongue
got
its
way
again
and
the
inevitable
subjects
were
resumed
she
talked
of
the
whose
acquaintance
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
she
had
made
at
the
seaside
described
their
manoeuvres
to
obtain
private
interviews
with
her
repeated
jokes
of
their
invention
specified
her
favourites
all
at
headlong
speed
of
disjointed
narrative
emily
sat
beneath
the
infliction
feeling
that
to
go
through
this
on
alternate
days
for
some
weeks
would
be
beyond
her
power
she
would
not
rise
and
depart
for
a
gathering
warmth
within
encouraged
her
to
await
a
moment
when
speech
would
come
to
her
aid
it
did
so
at
length
her
thought
found
words
almost
involuntarily
i
afraid
we
shall
not
do
much
good
if
we
always
spend
our
mornings
like
this
but
i
thought
we
done
enough
for
so
but
what
i
want
to
say
is
this
will
you
as
a
kindness
to
me
forget
these
subjects
when
we
are
together
i
do
mind
what
else
you
talk
about
but
stories
of
this
kind
make
me
fidgety
i
feel
as
if
i
should
be
obliged
to
get
up
and
run
away
you
really
mean
it
you
do
like
me
to
talk
about
gentlemen
what
a
queer
girl
you
are
emily
why
you
not
settling
down
to
be
an
old
maid
at
your
age
are
you
say
so
perhaps
that
explains
it
that
queer
i
ca
see
myself
what
else
there
is
to
talk
about
grammar
all
very
well
when
we
children
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
a
girl
has
to
do
is
to
look
out
for
a
husband
how
you
can
be
satisfied
with
books
the
infinite
contempt
she
put
into
the
word
more
than
i
can
make
out
you
will
do
what
i
ask
as
a
kindness
i
am
in
earnest
i
shall
be
afraid
of
seeing
you
if
you
ca
help
talking
of
such
things
jessie
laughed
extravagantly
such
a
state
of
mind
was
to
her
comical
beyond
expression
a
queer
one
of
course
i
do
as
you
wish
you
sha
hear
me
mention
a
single
gentleman
name
and
i
tell
all
the
others
to
be
careful
whenever
you
come
emily
averted
her
face
it
was
reddened
with
annoyance
at
the
thought
of
being
discussed
in
this
way
by
all
the
cartwright
household
can
do
that
if
you
like
she
said
coldly
it
no
part
of
my
wish
i
spoke
of
the
hours
when
we
are
together
for
study
well
i
wo
say
anything
replied
the
girl
who
was
enough
beneath
all
her
vulgarities
now
what
shall
we
do
till
must
make
the
best
of
my
way
home
nonsense
why
you
going
to
have
dinner
with
us
of
course
that
was
understood
not
by
emily
however
it
cost
a
good
deal
of
firmness
for
the
cartwrights
one
and
all
would
lay
hands
on
you
rather
than
lose
a
guest
but
emily
made
good
her
escape
once
well
on
her
way
to
banbrigg
she
took
in
great
breaths
of
free
air
as
if
after
a
close
and
unwholesome
atmosphere
she
cried
mentally
for
an
ounce
of
civet
there
was
upon
her
too
that
uneasy
sense
of
shame
which
is
apt
to
possess
a
reticent
nature
when
it
has
been
compelled
or
tempted
to
some
unwonted
freedom
of
speech
would
it
not
have
been
better
she
asked
herself
to
merely
avoid
the
talk
she
found
so
hateful
by
resolutely
advancing
other
topics
perhaps
not
it
was
just
possible
that
her
words
might
bear
some
kind
of
fruit
but
she
wished
heartily
that
this
task
of
hopeless
teaching
had
never
been
proposed
to
her
it
would
trouble
her
waking
every
other
day
and
disturb
with
a
profitless
annoyance
the
ideal
serenity
for
which
she
was
striving
yet
it
had
one
good
result
her
mother
follies
and
weaknesses
were
very
easy
to
bear
in
comparison
and
when
the
midday
meal
was
over
she
enjoyed
with
more
fulness
the
peace
of
her
father
room
upstairs
where
she
had
arranged
a
table
for
her
own
work
brilliant
sunlight
made
the
bare
garret
with
its
outlook
over
the
fields
towards
pendal
a
cheerful
and
homelike
retreat
here
whilst
the
clock
below
wheezed
and
panted
after
the
relentless
hours
emily
read
hard
at
german
or
when
her
mind
called
for
rest
sheltered
herself
beneath
the
wing
of
some
poet
who
voiced
for
her
the
mute
hymns
of
her
soul
but
the
most
sacred
hour
was
when
her
parents
had
gone
to
rest
and
she
sat
in
her
bedroom
writing
her
secret
thoughts
for
wilfrid
some
day
to
read
she
had
resolved
to
keep
for
him
a
journal
of
her
inner
life
from
day
to
day
in
this
way
she
might
hope
to
reveal
herself
more
truthfully
than
spoken
words
would
ever
allow
she
feared
that
never
not
even
in
the
confidence
of
their
married
life
would
her
tongue
learn
to
overcome
the
fear
of
its
own
utterances
how
little
she
had
told
him
of
herself
of
her
love
in
surrey
she
had
been
so
timid
she
had
scarcely
done
more
than
allow
him
to
guess
her
thoughts
and
at
their
last
meeting
she
had
been
compelled
into
opposition
of
his
purpose
so
that
brief
time
had
been
left
for
free
exchange
of
tenderness
but
some
day
she
would
put
this
little
book
of
manuscript
into
his
hands
and
the
shadowy
bars
between
him
and
her
would
vanish
she
could
only
write
in
it
late
at
night
when
the
still
voice
within
spoke
clearly
amid
the
hush
the
only
sound
from
the
outer
world
was
that
of
a
train
now
and
then
speeding
by
and
that
carried
her
thoughts
to
wilfrid
who
had
journeyed
far
from
her
into
other
countries
emily
loved
silence
the
nurse
of
the
soul
the
earliest
and
the
latest
hours
were
to
her
most
dear
it
had
never
been
to
her
either
an
impulse
or
a
joy
to
realise
the
existence
of
the
mass
of
mankind
she
had
shrunk
after
the
first
excitement
from
the
thronged
streets
of
london
passing
from
them
with
delight
to
the
quiet
country
others
might
find
their
strength
in
the
sense
of
universal
human
fellowship
she
would
fain
live
apart
kindly
disposed
to
all
but
understanding
well
that
her
first
duty
was
to
tend
the
garden
of
her
mind
that
it
was
also
her
first
joy
was
by
the
principles
of
her
religion
justification
in
pursuing
it
in
a
few
days
she
obliged
her
mother
to
concede
to
her
a
share
in
the
work
of
the
house
she
had
nothing
of
the
common
feminine
interest
in
such
work
for
its
own
sake
but
it
was
a
pleasure
to
lessen
her
toil
there
was
very
little
converse
between
them
for
evidently
they
belonged
to
different
worlds
when
mrs
hood
took
her
repose
it
was
elsewhere
than
in
the
room
where
emily
sat
and
emily
herself
did
not
seek
to
alter
this
habit
knowing
that
she
often
quite
involuntarily
caused
her
mother
irritation
and
that
to
reduce
their
intercourse
as
far
as
could
be
without
marked
estrangement
was
the
best
way
to
make
it
endurable
to
both
but
the
evening
hours
she
invariably
devoted
to
her
father
the
shortness
of
the
time
that
she
was
able
to
give
him
was
a
reason
for
losing
no
moment
of
this
communion
she
knew
that
the
forecast
of
the
evening
happiness
sustained
him
through
the
long
day
and
even
so
slight
a
pleasure
as
that
she
bestowed
in
opening
the
door
at
his
arrival
she
would
not
willingly
have
suffered
him
to
lose
it
did
not
appear
that
mrs
hood
reflected
on
this
exclusive
attachment
in
emily
it
certainly
troubled
her
not
at
all
this
order
in
the
house
was
of
long
standing
it
had
grown
to
seem
as
natural
as
poverty
and
hopelessness
emily
and
her
father
reasoned
as
little
about
their
mutual
affection
to
both
it
was
a
priceless
part
of
life
given
to
them
by
the
same
dark
powers
that
destroy
and
deprive
it
behoved
them
to
enjoy
it
while
permitted
to
do
so
had
she
known
the
recent
causes
of
trouble
which
weighed
upon
her
parents
emily
would
scarcely
have
been
able
to
still
keep
her
secret
from
them
the
anxiety
upon
her
father
face
and
her
mother
ceaseless
complaining
were
too
familiar
to
suggest
anything
unusual
she
had
come
home
with
the
resolve
to
maintain
silence
if
only
because
her
marriage
seemed
remote
and
contingent
upon
many
circumstances
and
other
reasons
had
manifested
themselves
to
her
even
before
wilfrid
visit
at
any
time
she
would
find
a
difficulty
in
speaking
upon
such
a
subject
with
her
mother
strange
though
it
may
sound
the
intimacy
between
them
was
not
near
enough
to
encourage
such
a
disclosure
with
all
the
explanations
it
would
involve
nor
yet
to
her
father
would
she
willingly
speak
of
what
had
happened
until
it
became
necessary
to
do
so
sense
of
the
sanctity
of
relations
such
as
those
between
wilfrid
and
herself
had
through
so
different
a
cause
very
much
the
same
effects
as
what
we
call
false
shame
the
complex
motives
of
virgin
modesty
had
with
her
become
a
conscious
sustaining
power
a
faith
of
all
beautiful
things
that
the
mind
could
conceive
this
mystery
was
the
loveliest
and
the
least
capable
of
being
revealed
to
others
however
near
without
desecration
perhaps
she
had
been
aided
in
the
nurturing
of
this
ideal
by
her
loneliness
no
friend
had
ever
tempted
her
to
confidences
her
gravest
and
purest
thoughts
had
never
been
imparted
to
any
thus
she
had
escaped
that
blunting
of
fine
perceptions
which
is
the
all
but
inevitable
result
of
endeavouring
to
express
them
not
to
speak
of
mere
vulgarity
such
as
jessie
cartwright
exhibited
emily
instinct
shrank
from
things
which
usage
has
for
most
people
made
matters
of
course
the
public
ceremony
of
marriage
for
instance
she
deemed
a
barbarism
as
a
sacrament
the
holiest
of
all
its
celebration
should
she
felt
be
in
the
strictest
privacy
as
for
its
aspect
as
a
legal
contract
let
that
concession
to
human
misery
be
made
with
the
smallest
not
the
greatest
violation
of
religious
feeling
thinking
thus
it
was
natural
that
she
should
avail
herself
of
every
motive
for
delay
and
in
that
very
wretchedness
of
her
home
which
her
marriage
would
she
trusted
in
a
great
measure
alleviate
she
found
one
of
the
strongest
the
atmosphere
of
sordid
suffering
depressed
her
it
was
only
by
an
effort
that
she
shook
off
the
influences
which
assailed
her
sadder
nature
at
times
her
fears
were
wrought
upon
and
it
almost
exceeded
her
power
to
believe
in
the
future
wilfrid
had
created
for
her
the
change
from
the
beautiful
home
in
surrey
to
the
sad
dreariness
of
banbrigg
had
followed
too
suddenly
upon
the
revelation
of
her
blessedness
it
indisposed
her
to
make
known
what
was
so
dreamlike
for
the
past
became
more
dreadful
viewed
from
the
ground
of
hope
emily
came
to
contemplate
it
as
some
hideous
beast
which
though
she
seemed
to
be
escaping
its
reach
might
even
yet
spring
upon
her
how
had
she
borne
that
past
so
lightly
her
fear
of
all
its
misery
was
at
moments
excessive
looking
at
her
unhappy
parents
she
felt
that
their
lot
would
crush
her
with
pity
did
she
not
see
the
relief
approaching
she
saw
it
yet
too
often
trembled
with
the
most
baseless
fears
she
tried
to
assure
herself
that
she
had
acted
rightly
in
resisting
wilfrid
proposal
of
an
immediate
marriage
yet
she
often
wished
her
conscience
had
not
spoken
against
it
wilfrid
own
words
though
merely
prompted
by
his
eagerness
ceaselessly
came
back
to
her
that
it
is
ill
to
refuse
a
kindness
offered
by
fate
so
seldom
kind
the
words
were
true
enough
and
their
truth
answered
to
that
melancholy
which
when
her
will
was
in
abeyance
coloured
her
views
of
life
but
here
at
length
was
a
letter
from
wilfrid
a
glad
encouraging
letter
his
father
had
concluded
that
he
was
staying
behind
in
england
to
be
married
and
evidently
would
not
have
disturbed
himself
greatly
even
if
such
had
been
the
case
all
was
going
well
nothing
of
the
past
should
be
sacrificed
and
the
future
was
their
own
chapter
viii
a
sterner
wooing
it
was
an
unusual
thing
for
the
middle
of
august
to
find
richard
dagworthy
still
in
dunfield
through
all
the
other
months
of
the
year
he
stuck
closely
to
the
mill
but
the
best
three
weeks
of
august
were
his
holiday
as
a
rule
he
went
to
scotland
sometimes
in
company
with
a
friend
more
often
alone
in
the
previous
year
he
had
taken
a
wider
flight
and
made
his
first
visit
to
the
continent
but
this
was
not
likely
to
be
repeated
for
some
time
he
always
referred
to
it
as
more
or
less
of
a
feat
the
expense
to
begin
with
was
greater
than
he
could
readily
reconcile
himself
to
and
the
indulgence
of
his
curiosity
not
inactive
hardly
compensated
for
his
lack
of
ease
amid
the
unfamiliar
conditions
of
foreign
travel
richard
represented
an
intermediate
stage
of
development
between
the
operative
who
conquers
wealth
and
his
descendant
who
shall
know
what
use
to
make
of
it
therein
lay
the
significance
of
the
man
life
its
pathos
moreover
looking
at
him
casually
from
the
outside
one
found
small
suggestion
of
the
pathetic
in
his
hard
face
and
brusque
manners
nearer
companionship
revealed
occasional
glimpses
of
a
mood
out
of
harmony
with
the
vulgar
pursuits
and
solicitudes
which
for
the
most
part
seemed
to
absorb
him
one
caught
a
hint
of
loneliness
in
his
existence
his
reticences
often
very
marked
in
the
flow
of
his
unpolished
talk
seemed
to
indicate
some
disappointment
and
a
dislike
to
dwell
upon
it
in
point
of
fact
his
life
was
rather
lonely
his
two
sisters
were
married
in
other
towns
and
since
the
death
of
his
wife
he
had
held
no
communications
with
her
relatives
the
child
was
all
he
had
of
family
and
though
his
paternal
affections
were
strong
he
was
not
the
man
to
content
his
hours
of
leisure
with
gambols
in
a
nursery
his
dogs
were
doubtless
a
great
resource
and
in
a
measure
made
up
to
him
for
the
lack
of
domestic
interests
yet
there
sometimes
passed
days
during
which
he
did
not
visit
the
kennels
always
a
sign
to
the
servants
to
beware
of
his
temper
which
at
such
seasons
was
easily
roused
to
fury
the
reputation
he
had
in
dunfield
for
brutality
of
behaviour
dated
from
his
prosecution
for
violent
assault
by
a
groom
whom
in
one
of
his
fits
of
rage
he
had
all
but
pounded
to
a
jelly
the
incident
occurred
early
in
his
married
life
and
was
no
doubt
the
origin
of
the
very
prevalent
belief
that
he
had
ruled
his
wife
by
similar
methods
dunfield
society
was
a
little
shy
of
him
for
some
time
after
until
indeed
by
becoming
a
widower
he
presented
himself
once
more
in
an
interesting
light
though
he
possibly
brought
about
his
wife
death
by
that
did
not
alter
the
fact
that
he
had
a
carriage
and
pair
to
offer
to
the
lady
whom
he
might
be
disposed
to
make
her
successor
his
marriage
had
been
of
a
kind
that
occasioned
general
surprise
and
in
certain
circles
indignation
there
had
come
to
live
in
one
of
the
smaller
houses
upon
the
heath
a
family
consisting
of
a
lady
and
her
two
daughters
their
name
was
hanmer
and
their
previous
home
had
been
in
hebsworth
the
large
manufacturing
town
which
is
a
sort
of
metropolis
to
dunfield
and
other
smaller
centres
round
about
hanmer
was
recently
dead
he
had
been
a
banker
but
suffered
grave
losses
in
a
period
of
commercial
depression
and
left
his
family
poorly
off
various
reasons
led
to
his
widow
quitting
hebsworth
dunfield
inquirers
naturally
got
hold
of
stories
more
or
less
to
the
disgrace
of
the
deceased
hanmer
the
elder
of
the
two
daughters
richard
dagworthy
married
after
an
acquaintance
of
something
less
than
six
months
dunfield
threw
up
its
hands
in
amazement
such
a
proceeding
on
young
dagworthy
part
was
not
only
shabby
to
the
families
which
had
upon
him
the
claim
of
expectancy
but
was
in
itself
inexplicable
miss
hanmer
might
be
but
richard
always
called
to
distinguish
him
from
his
father
had
surely
outgrown
such
a
very
infantile
reason
of
choice
when
other
attractions
were
to
the
dunfield
mind
altogether
wanting
the
hanmers
were
not
only
poor
but
more
shameful
still
positively
up
in
their
poverty
they
came
originally
from
the
south
of
england
forsooth
and
spoke
in
an
affected
way
pronouncing
their
vowels
absurdly
well
the
consoling
reflection
was
that
his
wife
would
soon
make
him
see
that
she
despised
him
for
if
ever
there
was
a
thorough
yorkshireman
it
was
richard
dunfield
comments
on
dagworthy
seemed
to
find
some
justification
in
the
turn
things
took
richard
distinctly
began
to
neglect
those
of
his
old
friends
who
smacked
most
of
the
soil
if
they
visited
his
house
his
wife
received
them
with
an
affected
graciousness
which
was
so
unmistakably
up
that
they
were
in
no
hurry
to
come
again
and
her
behaviour
when
she
returned
visits
was
felt
to
be
so
offensive
that
worthy
ladies
already
prejudiced
had
a
difficulty
in
refraining
from
a
kind
of
frankness
which
would
have
brought
about
a
crisis
the
town
was
perpetually
busy
with
gossip
concerning
the
uncomfortableness
of
things
in
the
house
on
the
heath
old
dagworthy
it
was
declared
had
roundly
bidden
his
son
seek
a
domicile
elsewhere
since
joint
occupancy
of
the
home
had
become
impossible
whether
such
a
change
was
in
reality
contemplated
could
never
be
determined
the
old
man
death
removed
the
occasion
dagworthy
survived
him
little
more
than
half
a
year
so
there
said
dunfield
was
a
mistake
well
done
with
and
it
was
disposed
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
what
was
the
truth
of
all
this
that
dagworthy
married
hastily
and
found
his
wife
uncongenial
and
that
dagworthy
passed
the
last
two
years
of
her
life
in
mourning
over
a
fatal
mistake
was
all
that
could
be
affirmed
as
fact
and
probably
the
two
persons
most
nearly
concerned
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
throw
more
light
upon
the
situation
outwardly
it
was
as
commonplace
a
story
as
could
be
told
even
the
accession
of
interest
which
would
have
come
of
dagworthy
cruelty
was
due
to
the
imagination
of
dunfield
gossips
richard
was
miserable
enough
in
his
home
and
frequently
but
his
wife
had
nothing
worse
from
him
than
an
angry
word
now
and
then
after
the
first
few
months
of
their
marriage
the
two
lived
as
far
as
possible
separate
lives
dagworthy
spent
the
days
with
her
mother
and
sister
richard
at
the
mill
and
the
evenings
were
got
through
with
as
little
friction
as
might
be
between
two
people
neither
of
whom
could
speak
half
a
dozen
words
without
irritating
or
disgusting
the
other
the
interesting
feature
of
the
case
was
the
unexpectedness
of
dagworthy
choice
it
evinced
so
much
more
originality
than
one
looked
for
in
such
a
man
it
was
indeed
the
outcome
of
ambitions
which
were
not
at
all
clear
to
their
possessor
miss
hanmer
had
impressed
him
as
no
other
woman
had
done
simply
because
she
had
graces
and
accomplishments
of
a
kind
hitherto
unknown
to
him
richard
felt
that
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
in
familiar
intercourse
with
a
her
refined
modes
of
speech
her
little
personal
delicacies
her
unconscious
revelation
of
knowledge
which
he
deemed
the
result
of
deep
study
even
her
pretty
and
harmless
witticisms
at
the
expense
of
dunfield
dignitaries
touched
his
slumbering
imagination
with
singular
force
miss
hanmer
speedily
observing
her
power
made
the
most
of
it
she
was
and
poverty
rendered
her
position
desperate
dagworthy
at
first
amused
her
as
a
specimen
of
the
wealthy
boor
but
the
evident
delight
he
found
in
her
society
constrained
her
to
admit
that
the
boor
possessed
the
elements
of
good
taste
the
courtship
was
of
rapid
progress
the
interests
at
stake
being
so
simply
defined
on
either
side
and
circumstances
presenting
no
kind
of
obstacle
the
lady
accepted
him
without
hesitation
and
triumphed
in
her
good
fortune
dagworthy
conceived
that
his
end
was
gained
in
reality
it
was
the
beginning
of
his
disillusion
it
speedily
became
clear
to
him
that
he
did
not
really
care
for
his
wife
that
he
had
been
the
victim
of
some
which
was
all
the
more
exasperating
because
difficult
to
be
explained
the
danger
of
brutality
on
his
part
really
lay
in
this
first
discovery
of
his
mistake
the
presence
of
his
father
in
the
house
was
a
most
fortunate
circumstance
it
necessitated
at
a
time
when
it
was
hardest
to
maintain
later
he
was
too
much
altered
from
the
elementary
creature
he
had
been
to
stand
in
danger
of
grossly
his
wife
his
marriage
developed
the
man
surprisingly
it
made
him
in
a
degree
he
could
not
formerly
have
conceived
he
had
fully
believed
that
this
woman
was
in
love
with
him
and
the
belief
had
flattered
him
inexpressibly
to
become
aware
that
she
regarded
him
with
disgust
only
kept
under
by
fear
was
to
receive
light
on
many
things
besides
the
personal
relations
between
himself
and
her
if
he
had
not
in
reality
regarded
her
at
any
time
with
strong
feeling
what
had
made
him
so
bent
on
gaining
her
for
his
wife
to
puzzle
this
over
the
problem
would
not
quit
his
mind
was
to
become
dimly
aware
of
what
he
had
hoped
for
and
what
he
had
missed
it
was
not
her
affection
he
felt
that
the
absence
of
this
was
not
the
worst
thing
he
had
to
bear
gradually
he
came
to
understand
that
he
had
been
deceived
by
artificialities
which
mocked
the
image
of
something
for
which
he
really
longed
and
that
something
was
refinement
within
and
without
a
life
directed
by
other
motives
and
desires
than
those
he
had
known
a
spirit
aiming
at
things
he
did
not
understand
yet
which
he
would
gladly
have
had
explained
to
him
there
followed
resentment
of
the
deceit
that
had
been
practised
on
him
the
woman
had
been
merely
caught
by
his
money
and
it
followed
that
she
was
contemptible
instead
of
a
higher
he
had
wedded
a
lower
than
himself
she
did
not
care
even
to
exercise
the
slight
hypocrisy
by
which
she
might
have
kept
his
admiration
the
cruelest
feature
of
the
wrong
he
had
suffered
was
that
by
the
disclosure
of
her
unworthiness
his
wife
was
teaching
him
the
real
value
of
that
which
he
had
aimed
at
blindly
and
so
deplorably
failed
to
gain
dagworthy
had
a
period
almost
of
despair
it
was
then
that
in
an
access
of
fury
he
committed
the
brutality
which
created
so
many
myths
about
his
domestic
life
to
be
hauled
into
the
and
to
be
well
aware
what
dunfield
was
saying
about
him
was
not
exactly
an
agreeable
experience
but
it
had
like
his
marriage
an
educational
value
he
knew
that
the
thrashing
administered
to
the
groom
had
been
a
vicarious
one
and
this
actively
awakened
sense
of
a
possible
inner
meaning
of
things
was
not
without
its
influence
upon
him
it
was
remarked
that
he
heard
the
imposition
of
his
fine
with
a
suppressed
laugh
dunfield
repeating
the
story
with
florid
circumstance
of
course
viewed
it
as
an
illustration
of
his
debauched
state
of
mind
in
reality
the
laugh
came
of
a
perception
of
the
solemn
absurdity
of
the
proceedings
and
richard
was
by
so
much
the
nearer
to
understanding
himself
and
the
world
his
wife
death
came
as
an
relief
he
felt
like
a
man
beginning
the
world
anew
he
had
no
leaning
to
melancholy
and
a
prolongation
of
his
domestic
troubles
would
not
have
made
him
less
hearty
in
his
outward
bearing
but
the
progress
of
time
had
developed
elements
in
his
nature
which
were
scarcely
compatible
with
a
continuance
of
the
life
he
had
been
leading
he
had
begun
to
put
to
himself
ominous
questions
such
for
instance
as
what
necessity
was
he
under
to
maintain
the
appearance
of
a
cheerful
domesticity
if
things
got
just
a
trifle
more
unbearable
why
should
he
not
make
for
himself
somewhere
else
a
new
home
he
was
it
is
true
startled
at
his
own
audacity
and
only
some
strangely
powerful
concurrence
of
motives
such
as
he
was
yet
to
know
could
in
reality
have
made
him
reckless
for
the
other
features
of
his
character
those
which
tended
to
stability
were
still
strong
enough
to
oppose
passions
which
had
not
found
the
occasion
for
their
full
development
he
was
not
exactly
avaricious
but
pursuit
of
money
was
in
him
an
hereditary
instinct
by
mere
force
of
habit
he
stuck
zealously
to
his
business
and
without
thinking
much
about
his
wealth
disliked
unusual
expenditure
his
wife
had
taunted
him
with
meanness
with
low
the
effect
had
been
to
make
him
all
the
more
tenacious
of
habits
which
might
have
given
way
before
other
kinds
of
reproof
so
he
had
gone
on
living
the
ordinary
life
to
all
appearances
well
contented
in
reality
troubled
from
time
to
time
by
a
reawakening
of
those
desires
which
he
had
understood
only
to
have
them
frustrated
he
groped
in
a
dim
way
after
things
which
by
chance
perceived
seemed
to
have
a
certain
bearing
on
his
life
the
discovery
in
himself
of
an
interest
in
architecture
was
an
instance
but
for
his
visit
to
the
continent
he
might
never
have
been
led
to
think
of
the
subject
then
there
was
his
fondness
for
the
moors
and
mountains
the
lochs
and
islands
of
the
north
on
the
whole
he
preferred
to
travel
in
scotland
by
himself
the
scenery
appealed
to
a
poetry
that
was
in
him
if
only
he
could
have
brought
it
into
consciousness
already
he
had
planned
for
the
present
august
a
tour
among
the
hebrides
and
had
made
it
out
with
his
maps
and
guidebooks
not
without
careful
consideration
of
expense
why
did
he
linger
beyond
the
day
on
which
he
had
decided
to
set
forth
for
several
days
it
had
been
noticed
at
the
mill
that
he
lacked
something
of
his
wonted
attention
in
matters
of
business
certainly
his
occupation
about
eleven
one
morning
had
little
apparent
bearing
on
the
concerns
of
his
office
he
was
standing
at
the
window
of
his
private
room
which
was
on
the
first
floor
of
the
mill
with
a
large
at
his
eyes
the
glass
was
focussed
upon
the
garden
in
which
sat
jessie
with
emily
hood
they
were
but
a
short
distance
away
and
dagworthy
could
observe
them
closely
he
had
done
so
intermittently
for
almost
an
hour
and
this
was
the
second
morning
that
he
had
thus
amused
himself
yet
to
judge
from
his
face
when
he
turned
away
amusement
was
hardly
his
state
of
mind
his
features
had
a
earnestness
an
expression
almost
savage
and
then
he
walked
about
the
little
room
regarding
objects
absently
four
days
later
he
was
again
with
his
glass
at
the
window
it
wanted
a
few
minutes
of
ten
emily
hood
had
just
reached
the
garden
he
saw
her
enter
and
begin
to
pace
about
the
walks
waiting
for
arrival
dagworthy
of
a
sudden
put
the
glass
aside
took
his
hat
and
hastened
away
from
the
mill
he
walked
along
the
edge
of
the
till
he
came
into
the
road
by
which
jessie
must
approach
the
garden
he
saw
her
coming
and
went
on
at
a
brisk
pace
towards
her
the
girl
was
not
hurrying
though
she
would
be
late
these
lessons
were
beginning
to
tax
her
rather
too
seriously
emily
was
so
exacting
already
she
had
made
a
change
in
the
arrangements
whereby
she
saved
herself
the
walk
to
banbrigg
in
the
garden
too
it
was
much
easier
to
find
excuses
for
trifling
away
time
than
when
she
was
face
to
face
with
emily
at
a
table
so
she
came
along
the
road
at
a
very
moderate
pace
and
on
seeing
who
it
was
that
neared
her
put
on
her
pleasantest
smile
doubly
glad
of
the
meeting
it
was
always
something
to
try
her
devices
on
richard
dagworthy
and
at
present
the
chat
would
make
a
delay
for
which
she
could
urge
reasonable
excuse
very
person
i
wanted
to
meet
dagworthy
exclaimed
saved
me
a
run
all
the
way
up
to
your
house
what
are
you
doing
this
way
going
to
school
he
pointed
to
the
books
she
carried
like
it
replied
jessie
with
a
wry
movement
of
her
lips
did
you
want
to
meet
me
though
i
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
that
is
if
you
will
but
really
where
were
you
going
perhaps
you
ca
spare
time
was
going
to
the
garden
she
said
pointing
in
that
direction
have
lessons
there
with
emily
hood
beastly
shame
that
i
should
have
to
do
lessons
is
it
i
feel
too
old
for
that
i
got
other
things
to
think
about
she
put
her
head
on
one
side
and
rustled
the
pages
of
a
french
grammar
at
last
throwing
a
glance
at
richard
from
the
corners
of
her
eyes
do
you
expect
miss
hood
to
come
soon
dagworthy
asked
playing
his
part
very
well
in
spite
of
a
nervousness
which
possessed
him
doubt
she
in
the
garden
already
i
given
her
a
key
so
that
if
she
gets
there
first
but
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
walk
to
the
station
and
meet
the
ten
train
from
hebsworth
your
father
will
get
in
by
it
i
expect
and
i
want
him
to
come
and
see
me
at
once
at
the
mill
right
jessie
exclaimed
with
eagerness
go
just
let
me
run
and
tell
emily
dagworthy
was
consulting
his
watch
only
bare
time
to
get
to
the
station
walking
as
quickly
as
you
can
which
is
your
garden
let
me
go
and
tell
her
you
are
not
coming
you
the
second
door
round
the
corner
there
you
have
to
apologize
properly
i
hope
you
know
how
to
this
was
jessie
maidenly
playfulness
she
held
out
her
hand
with
many
graces
to
take
leave
he
does
come
said
dagworthy
you
just
walk
over
to
the
mill
to
let
me
know
do
know
that
i
shall
i
do
think
it
would
be
proper
ho
i
like
that
but
you
have
to
be
off
or
you
never
get
there
in
time
she
ran
away
rejoicing
in
her
escape
from
the
lesson
of
course
she
looked
back
several
times
the
first
glance
showed
her
dagworthy
still
gazing
after
her
at
the
second
she
saw
that
he
was
walking
towards
the
garden
he
pushed
open
the
wooden
door
and
passed
between
the
hedges
the
next
door
stood
open
and
he
already
saw
emily
she
had
seated
herself
under
one
of
the
pear
trees
and
was
reading
as
soon
as
his
eyes
discovered
her
he
paused
his
hands
clasped
themselves
nervously
behind
him
then
he
proceeded
more
slowly
as
soon
as
he
stepped
within
the
garden
emily
heard
his
approach
and
turned
her
head
with
a
smile
expectant
of
jessie
at
the
sight
of
dagworthy
the
smile
vanished
instantly
she
became
noticeably
pale
and
at
length
rose
with
a
startled
motion
dagworthy
drew
near
to
her
when
close
enough
to
hold
out
his
hand
he
could
no
longer
keep
his
eyes
upon
her
face
they
fell
and
his
visage
showed
an
embarrassment
which
even
in
her
confusion
her
all
but
dread
emily
noticed
as
a
strange
thing
she
was
struggling
to
command
herself
to
overcome
by
reason
the
fear
which
always
attacked
her
in
this
man
presence
she
felt
it
as
a
relief
to
be
spared
the
steady
gaze
which
on
former
meetings
he
had
never
removed
from
her
are
surprised
to
see
me
here
he
began
taking
hold
of
the
chair
which
emily
had
risen
from
and
swaying
it
backwards
and
forwards
even
his
voice
was
more
subdued
than
she
had
ever
known
it
have
come
to
apologise
to
you
for
sending
miss
cartwright
to
meet
her
father
at
the
station
i
met
her
by
chance
just
out
there
in
the
road
and
as
i
wanted
a
messenger
very
badly
i
took
advantage
of
her
but
she
would
go
unless
i
promised
to
come
here
and
explain
her
absence
you
emily
replied
as
naturally
as
she
could
she
still
come
back
for
her
lesson
do
you
think
afraid
not
she
said
i
had
better
ask
you
to
excuse
her
this
morning
emily
gathered
up
two
or
three
books
which
lay
on
the
other
chair
find
her
rather
troublesome
to
teach
i
should
be
afraid
dagworthy
pursued
watching
her
every
moment
is
much
for
study
is
she
she
is
a
little
absent
now
and
then
replied
emily
saying
the
first
thing
that
occurred
to
her
she
had
collected
her
books
and
was
about
to
fasten
a
strap
round
them
let
me
do
that
for
you
said
dagworthy
and
he
forestalled
her
assent
which
she
would
probably
not
have
given
by
taking
the
books
from
her
hands
he
put
up
his
foot
on
the
chair
as
if
for
the
convenience
of
doing
the
strapping
on
his
knee
but
before
he
had
finished
it
he
spoke
again
are
fond
of
teaching
i
suppose
i
like
it
she
stood
in
expectant
waiting
her
hands
held
together
before
her
her
head
just
bent
the
attitude
was
grace
itself
dagworthy
raised
his
eyes
slowly
from
her
feet
to
her
face
you
would
care
to
go
on
with
it
always
i
do
think
about
it
she
replied
nervousness
again
seizing
her
there
was
a
new
look
in
his
eyes
a
vehemence
a
fervour
which
she
dared
not
meet
after
the
first
glance
he
would
not
finish
the
strapping
of
the
books
and
she
could
not
bid
him
do
so
had
she
obeyed
her
instinct
she
would
have
hastened
away
heedless
of
anything
but
the
desire
to
quit
his
presence
long
will
your
holidays
be
he
asked
letting
the
books
fall
to
the
chair
as
if
by
accident
the
end
of
september
i
think
long
i
glad
to
hear
that
you
will
come
again
some
day
to
my
house
with
your
father
wo
you
the
words
trembled
upon
his
lips
it
was
not
like
his
own
voice
he
could
not
control
it
you
dagworthy
she
replied
he
bent
to
the
books
again
and
this
time
succeeded
in
binding
them
together
as
he
fastened
the
buckle
drops
of
perspiration
fell
from
his
forehead
emily
thanked
him
and
held
forth
her
hand
for
the
books
he
took
it
in
his
own
hood
she
drew
her
hand
away
almost
by
force
and
retreated
a
step
his
face
terrified
her
sent
jessie
off
on
purpose
he
continued
knew
you
were
here
and
wanted
to
speak
to
you
alone
since
i
met
you
that
day
on
the
heath
i
have
had
no
rest
i
wanted
so
to
see
you
again
the
other
morning
at
the
cartwrights
it
was
almost
more
than
i
could
do
to
go
away
i
know
what
come
to
me
i
ca
put
you
out
of
my
thoughts
for
one
minute
i
ca
give
my
attention
to
business
to
anything
i
meant
to
have
gone
away
before
now
but
i
put
it
off
day
after
day
once
or
twice
i
all
but
come
to
your
house
to
ask
to
see
you
he
spoke
in
a
hurried
breathless
way
almost
with
violence
passion
was
forcing
the
words
from
him
in
spite
of
a
shame
which
kept
his
face
on
fire
there
was
something
boyish
in
the
simplicity
of
his
phrases
he
seemed
to
be
making
a
confession
that
was
compelled
by
fear
and
at
length
his
speech
lost
itself
in
incoherence
he
stood
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
perspiration
covered
his
face
dagworthy
emily
tried
to
break
the
intolerable
silence
her
strength
was
answering
now
to
the
demand
upon
it
his
utter
abashment
before
her
could
not
but
help
her
to
calmness
but
the
sound
of
her
first
word
gave
him
voice
again
me
speak
first
he
broke
forth
now
looking
full
at
her
nothing
of
what
i
wanted
to
say
it
sounds
as
if
i
was
man
enough
to
know
my
own
mind
i
know
it
well
enough
and
i
must
say
all
i
have
to
say
whilst
you
here
to
listen
to
me
after
all
you
only
a
girl
but
if
you
come
here
straight
from
heaven
i
could
find
it
harder
to
speak
to
you
dagworthy
do
speak
like
this
do
say
more
i
beg
you
not
to
i
can
not
listen
as
you
would
wish
me
to
ca
listen
but
you
do
know
what
i
have
to
say
still
he
urged
with
hasty
entreaty
his
voice
softer
asking
nothing
yet
i
only
want
you
to
know
how
you
made
me
feel
towards
you
no
feeling
will
ever
come
to
you
like
this
that
come
to
me
but
i
want
you
to
know
of
it
to
try
and
understand
what
it
means
to
try
and
think
of
me
i
do
ask
for
yes
or
no
it
would
be
reasonable
you
had
to
think
of
me
in
this
way
but
god
knows
how
i
shall
live
without
you
it
would
be
the
cruelest
word
woman
ever
said
if
you
refused
even
to
give
me
a
hope
can
not
do
hear
me
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
give
you
hope
you
say
that
because
you
think
you
must
because
i
have
come
to
you
so
suddenly
i
have
offended
you
by
talking
in
this
way
when
we
scarcely
know
each
other
even
as
friends
and
you
have
to
keep
me
at
a
distance
i
see
it
on
your
face
do
you
think
there
is
a
danger
that
i
should
be
less
respectful
to
you
than
i
ought
that
because
you
do
understand
me
i
spoken
in
rough
hasty
words
because
to
be
near
you
takes
all
sense
from
me
look
i
quieter
now
what
i
ought
to
have
said
at
first
is
this
you
prejudiced
against
me
you
heard
all
sorts
of
tales
i
know
well
enough
what
people
say
about
me
well
i
want
you
to
know
me
better
we
leave
all
other
feelings
aside
we
say
i
just
wish
you
to
think
of
me
in
a
just
way
a
friendly
way
nothing
more
impossible
for
you
to
do
more
than
that
at
first
no
doubt
even
your
father
has
told
you
that
i
have
a
hasty
temper
which
leads
me
to
say
and
do
things
i
soon
sorry
for
it
true
enough
but
that
prove
that
i
am
a
brute
and
that
i
ca
mend
myself
you
heard
things
laid
to
my
charge
that
are
false
about
my
doings
in
my
own
home
you
know
what
i
mean
get
to
know
me
better
and
some
day
tell
you
the
whole
truth
now
it
only
this
i
ask
of
you
be
just
to
me
you
not
a
woman
like
these
in
dunfield
who
talk
and
talk
behind
one
back
though
i
have
seen
so
little
of
you
do
i
know
the
difference
between
you
and
them
i
ignorant
enough
compared
with
you
but
i
can
feel
what
it
is
that
puts
you
above
all
other
women
it
must
be
that
that
makes
me
mad
to
gain
a
kind
word
from
you
one
word
that
you
try
to
think
of
me
and
i
live
on
that
as
long
as
i
can
the
mere
utterances
help
little
to
an
understanding
of
the
terrible
force
of
entreaty
he
put
into
this
speech
his
face
his
hands
the
posture
of
his
body
all
joined
in
pleading
he
had
cast
off
all
shamefacedness
and
spoke
as
if
his
life
depended
on
the
answer
she
would
return
the
very
lack
of
refinement
in
his
tone
in
his
pronunciation
of
certain
words
made
his
appeal
the
more
pathetic
with
the
quickness
of
jealousy
he
had
guessed
at
the
meaning
there
might
lie
in
emily
reluctance
to
hear
him
but
he
dared
not
entertain
the
thought
it
was
his
passionate
instinct
to
plead
it
down
whatever
it
might
be
that
she
had
in
mind
she
must
first
hear
him
as
he
spoke
he
watched
her
features
with
the
eagerness
of
desire
of
fear
to
do
so
was
but
to
inflame
his
passion
it
was
an
extraordinary
struggle
between
the
force
of
violent
appetite
and
the
constraint
of
love
in
the
higher
sense
how
the
former
had
been
excited
it
would
be
hard
to
explain
wilfrid
athel
had
submitted
to
the
same
influence
her
beauty
was
of
the
kind
which
leaving
the
ordinary
man
untouched
addressed
itself
with
the
strangest
potency
to
an
especially
vehement
nature
here
and
there
her
mind
uttering
itself
in
the
simplest
phrases
laid
a
spell
upon
certain
other
minds
set
apart
and
chosen
she
could
not
speak
but
the
soul
of
this
rude
was
exalted
beyond
his
own
intelligence
forced
to
wait
the
end
of
his
speech
emily
stood
with
her
head
bowed
in
sadness
fear
had
passed
she
recognised
the
sincerity
of
his
words
and
compassionated
him
when
he
became
silent
she
could
not
readily
reply
he
was
speaking
again
below
his
breath
are
thinking
i
know
how
you
ca
help
regarding
me
try
only
to
feel
for
me
is
only
one
way
in
which
i
can
answer
you
she
said
owe
it
to
you
to
hide
nothing
i
feel
deeply
the
sincerity
of
all
you
have
said
and
be
sure
dagworthy
that
i
will
never
think
of
you
unjustly
or
unkindly
but
i
can
promise
nothing
more
i
have
already
given
my
love
her
voice
faltered
before
the
last
word
the
word
she
would
never
lightly
utter
but
it
must
be
spoken
now
no
paraphrase
would
confirm
her
earnestness
sufficiently
still
keeping
her
eyes
on
the
ground
she
knew
that
he
had
started
have
promised
to
marry
some
one
he
asked
as
if
it
were
necessary
to
have
the
fact
affirmed
in
the
plainest
words
before
he
could
accept
it
she
hoped
that
silence
might
be
her
answer
you
do
you
mean
that
have
she
saw
that
he
was
turning
away
from
her
and
with
an
effort
she
looked
at
him
she
wished
she
had
not
his
anguish
expressed
itself
like
an
evil
passion
his
teeth
were
set
with
a
cruel
savageness
it
was
worse
when
he
caught
her
look
and
tried
to
smile
i
suppose
that
that
the
end
he
said
as
if
he
would
make
an
effort
to
joke
upon
it
though
his
voice
all
but
failed
in
speaking
the
few
words
he
walked
a
little
apart
then
approached
her
again
do
say
this
just
to
put
me
off
he
asked
with
a
roughness
which
was
rather
the
effect
of
his
attempt
to
keep
down
emotion
than
intentional
have
told
you
the
truth
emily
replied
firmly
other
people
know
it
do
the
cartwrights
are
the
only
one
to
whom
i
have
spoken
of
it
your
father
and
mother
you
mean
do
not
know
though
so
troubled
she
was
yet
able
to
ask
herself
whether
his
delicacy
was
sufficiently
developed
to
enjoin
silence
the
man
had
made
such
strange
revelation
of
himself
she
felt
unable
to
predict
his
course
no
refinement
in
him
would
now
have
surprised
her
but
neither
would
any
outbreak
of
boorishness
he
seemed
capable
of
both
his
next
question
augured
course
it
is
not
any
one
in
dunfield
is
not
jealousy
was
torturing
him
he
was
quite
conscious
that
he
should
have
refrained
from
a
single
question
yet
he
could
no
more
keep
these
back
than
he
could
the
utterance
of
his
passion
you
he
hesitated
i
leave
you
mr
dagworthy
emily
asked
seeing
that
he
was
not
likely
to
quit
her
she
moved
to
take
the
books
from
the
chair
minute
will
you
tell
me
who
it
is
i
am
a
brute
to
ask
you
but
if
you
good
god
how
shall
i
bear
this
he
turned
his
back
upon
her
she
saw
him
quiver
it
was
her
impulse
to
walk
from
the
garden
but
she
feared
to
pass
him
he
faced
her
again
yes
the
man
could
suffer
you
tell
me
who
it
is
he
groaned
rather
than
spoke
believe
that
i
should
speak
of
it
but
i
feel
i
could
bear
it
better
i
should
know
for
certain
it
was
no
use
hoping
emily
could
not
answer
is
some
one
in
london
dagworthy
i
can
not
tell
you
more
than
that
please
do
not
ask
more
wo
of
course
your
opinion
of
me
is
worse
than
ever
that
matter
if
you
could
kill
as
easily
as
you
can
drive
a
man
mad
i
would
ask
you
to
still
have
pity
on
i
forgetting
you
want
me
to
go
first
so
that
you
can
lock
up
the
he
did
not
offer
his
hand
but
cast
one
look
at
her
a
look
emily
never
forgot
and
walked
quickly
away
emily
could
not
start
at
once
homewards
when
it
was
certain
that
dagworthy
had
left
the
garden
she
seated
herself
she
had
need
of
rest
and
of
solitude
to
calm
her
thoughts
her
sensation
was
that
of
having
escaped
a
danger
the
dread
of
which
thrilled
in
her
though
fear
had
been
allayed
for
an
interval
it
regained
its
hold
upon
her
towards
the
end
of
the
dialogue
the
passion
she
had
witnessed
was
so
rude
so
undisciplined
it
seemed
to
expose
elementary
forces
which
if
need
be
would
set
every
constraint
at
defiance
it
was
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
she
did
not
feel
safe
in
the
man
presence
the
possibility
of
such
a
feeling
had
made
itself
known
to
her
even
during
the
visit
to
his
house
to
find
herself
suddenly
the
object
of
his
almost
frenzied
desire
was
to
realize
how
justly
her
instinct
had
spoken
this
was
not
love
as
she
understood
it
but
a
terrible
possession
which
might
find
assuagement
in
inflicting
some
fearful
harm
upon
what
it
affected
to
hold
dear
the
love
of
emily
worship
was
a
spirit
of
passionate
benignity
of
ecstatic
calm
holy
in
renunciations
pure
unutterably
in
supreme
attainment
her
knowledge
of
life
was
insufficient
to
allow
her
to
deal
justly
with
love
as
exhibited
in
dagworthy
its
gross
side
was
too
offensively
prominent
her
experience
gave
her
no
power
of
rightly
appreciating
this
struggle
of
the
divine
flame
in
a
dense
element
living
and
having
ever
lived
amid
idealisms
she
was
too
subjective
in
her
interpretation
of
phenomena
so
new
to
her
it
would
have
been
easier
for
her
to
judge
impartially
had
she
witnessed
this
passion
directed
towards
another
addressed
to
her
in
the
position
she
occupied
any
phase
of
wooing
would
have
been
painful
vehemence
was
nothing
less
than
abhorrent
wholly
ignorant
of
dagworthy
inner
life
and
misled
with
regard
to
the
mere
facts
of
his
outward
behaviour
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
discern
the
most
deeply
significant
features
of
the
love
he
expressed
so
ill
impossible
for
her
to
understand
that
what
would
be
brutality
in
another
man
was
in
him
the
working
of
the
very
means
of
grace
could
circumstances
have
favoured
their
action
one
tribute
her
instinct
paid
to
the
good
which
hid
itself
under
so
rude
a
guise
as
she
pondered
over
her
fear
analysing
it
as
scrupulously
as
she
always
did
those
feelings
which
she
felt
it
behoved
her
to
understand
once
for
all
she
half
discovered
in
it
an
element
which
only
severe
would
allow
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
fear
was
in
an
infinitesimal
degree
of
herself
that
under
other
conditions
she
might
have
known
what
it
was
to
respond
to
the
love
thus
offered
her
for
she
neither
scorned
nor
loathed
the
man
notwithstanding
her
abhorrence
of
his
passion
as
devoted
to
herself
she
wished
him
well
she
even
found
herself
thinking
over
those
women
in
dunfield
whom
she
knew
if
perchance
one
of
them
might
seem
fitted
to
make
his
happiness
none
the
less
it
was
terrible
to
reflect
that
she
must
live
perhaps
for
a
long
time
so
near
to
him
ever
exposed
to
the
risk
of
chance
meetings
if
not
to
the
danger
of
a
surprise
such
as
for
she
could
not
assure
herself
that
he
would
hold
her
answer
final
one
precaution
she
must
certainly
take
henceforth
she
would
never
come
to
the
garden
save
in
jessie
company
she
wondered
how
dagworthy
had
known
of
her
presence
here
and
it
occurred
to
her
to
doubt
of
jessie
could
the
latter
have
aided
in
bringing
about
this
interview
dagworthy
confessing
his
own
manoeuvre
would
naturally
conceal
any
conscious
part
in
it
that
jessie
might
have
taken
her
spirits
suffered
depression
as
she
communed
thus
with
herself
all
the
drearier
aspects
of
her
present
life
were
emphasised
she
longed
longed
with
aching
of
the
heart
for
the
day
which
should
set
her
free
for
ever
from
these
fears
and
sorrows
another
secret
would
henceforth
trouble
her
would
that
it
might
remain
a
secret
if
jessie
indeed
knew
of
this
morning
events
there
was
small
likelihood
that
it
would
remain
unknown
to
others
then
the
whole
truth
must
be
revealed
would
it
not
be
better
to
anticipate
any
such
discovery
to
tell
her
father
this
very
day
what
had
happened
and
why
it
was
so
painful
to
her
yet
to
speak
of
dagworthy
might
make
her
father
uneasy
in
his
position
at
the
mill
would
inevitably
do
so
therein
lay
a
new
dread
was
dagworthy
capable
of
taking
revenge
upon
her
father
oh
surely
surely
not
the
words
passed
her
lips
involuntarily
she
would
not
she
could
not
believe
so
ill
of
him
had
he
not
implored
her
to
do
him
justice
when
mr
hood
returned
from
business
on
the
following
day
he
brought
news
that
dagworthy
had
at
last
gone
for
his
holiday
it
was
time
he
said
dagworthy
was
not
looking
himself
at
the
mill
they
had
been
in
mortal
fear
of
one
of
his
outbreaks
he
speak
harshly
to
you
father
emily
was
driven
to
ask
with
very
slight
emphasis
on
the
was
the
reply
with
the
sad
abortive
laugh
which
was
mr
hood
nearest
approach
to
mirth
he
left
me
alone
and
spoke
neither
well
nor
ill
he
did
look
angry
i
thought
so
much
as
put
out
about
something
emily
was
relieved
from
one
fear
at
least
and
felt
grateful
to
dagworthy
moreover
by
observation
she
had
concluded
that
jessie
could
not
possibly
be
aware
of
what
had
taken
place
in
the
garden
and
now
dagworthy
was
likely
to
be
away
for
three
weeks
her
heart
was
lighter
again
chapter
ix
circumstance
dagworthy
was
absent
not
quite
a
fortnight
and
he
returned
looking
anything
but
the
better
for
his
holiday
the
wholesome
colour
of
his
cheeks
had
changed
almost
to
sallowness
those
who
met
him
in
dunfield
looked
at
him
with
surprise
and
asked
what
illness
he
had
been
suffering
at
the
mill
they
did
not
welcome
his
his
temper
was
worse
than
it
had
been
since
the
week
which
witnessed
his
prosecution
for
assault
and
battery
at
home
the
servants
did
their
best
to
keep
out
of
his
way
warned
by
jenkins
she
good
woman
had
been
rash
enough
to
bring
the
child
into
the
whilst
dagworthy
was
refreshing
himself
with
a
biscuit
and
a
glass
of
wine
upon
his
arrival
in
a
minute
or
two
she
retreated
in
high
wrath
him
dom
me
if
he
loikes
she
went
away
exclaiming
ovver
auld
to
care
much
abaht
such
fond
tantrums
but
when
he
gets
agaate
dommin
his
awn
barn
it
fair
maaks
my
teeth
dither
ageean
the
lad
aht
on
his
that
was
seven
in
the
evening
he
dined
an
hour
later
and
when
it
was
dark
left
the
house
between
then
and
midnight
he
was
constantly
in
and
out
and
jenkins
who
was
kept
up
by
her
fears
that
master
was
seriously
unwell
made
at
length
another
attempt
to
face
him
she
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
having
heard
him
enter
a
minute
or
two
before
no
answer
was
vouchsafed
so
she
made
bold
to
open
the
door
dagworthy
was
sitting
with
his
head
upon
the
table
his
arms
stretched
out
he
appeared
to
be
asleep
richard
she
said
softly
richard
he
looked
up
what
is
it
scahr
me
ah
thowt
summat
come
to
yo
what
wrong
wi
yo
richard
you
look
as
if
you
could
hardly
he
your
heead
up
to
her
surprise
he
spoke
quite
calmly
i
got
a
bit
of
a
headache
get
me
some
hot
water
will
you
i
have
some
brandy
and
go
to
bed
she
began
to
advise
other
remedies
but
dagworthy
speedily
checked
her
me
some
hot
water
i
tell
you
and
go
to
bed
yourself
what
are
you
doing
up
at
this
hour
he
went
to
business
at
the
usual
time
next
morning
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
worst
had
blown
over
at
home
he
was
sullen
but
not
violent
the
third
day
after
his
return
on
entering
his
office
at
the
mill
he
found
hood
taking
down
one
of
a
row
of
old
ledgers
which
stood
there
upon
a
shelf
are
you
doing
he
asked
abruptly
at
the
same
time
turning
his
back
upon
the
clerk
hood
explained
that
he
was
under
the
necessity
of
searching
through
the
accounts
for
several
years
to
throw
light
upon
a
certain
transaction
which
was
giving
trouble
right
was
the
reply
as
dagworthy
took
his
keys
out
to
open
his
desk
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
entered
the
room
where
hood
was
busy
over
the
ledger
a
second
clerk
was
seated
there
and
him
dagworthy
summoned
to
the
office
where
he
had
need
of
him
presently
hood
came
to
replace
the
ledger
he
had
examined
and
took
away
the
succeeding
volume
a
few
minutes
later
dagworthy
said
to
the
clerk
who
sat
with
him
shall
have
to
go
away
for
an
hour
or
so
i
expecting
a
telegram
from
legge
brothers
if
it
does
come
before
twelve
you
or
hood
must
go
to
hebsworth
it
had
better
be
hood
you
finish
what
at
if
there
no
telegram
he
must
take
the
and
give
this
note
here
to
andrew
legge
there
be
an
answer
mind
you
see
to
this
at
the
moment
when
dagworthy
tread
sounded
on
the
stairs
mr
hood
was
on
the
point
of
making
a
singular
discovery
in
turning
a
page
of
the
ledger
he
came
upon
an
envelope
old
and
yellow
which
had
evidently
been
shut
up
in
the
hook
for
several
years
it
was
without
address
and
unsealed
he
was
going
to
lay
it
aside
when
his
fingers
told
him
that
it
contained
something
the
enclosure
proved
to
be
a
note
also
old
and
patched
together
in
the
manner
of
notes
that
have
been
sent
half
at
a
time
i
wonder
how
that
got
left
there
hood
mused
been
rare
searching
for
that
i
be
bound
here
something
to
put
our
friend
into
a
better
temper
he
turned
the
note
over
once
or
twice
tried
in
vain
to
decipher
a
scribbled
endorsement
then
restored
it
to
the
envelope
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
he
went
to
the
office
dagworthy
out
he
asked
of
his
on
looking
round
the
clerk
was
a
facetious
youth
he
rose
from
his
seat
seized
a
ruler
and
began
a
species
of
about
hood
head
keeping
up
a
grotesque
dance
the
while
hood
bore
it
with
his
wonted
patience
smiling
faintly
dagworthy
out
he
repeated
as
soon
as
he
was
free
from
apprehension
of
a
chance
crack
on
the
crown
is
my
boy
and
what
more
there
a
chance
of
your
having
a
spree
in
hebsworth
go
down
on
your
knees
and
pray
that
no
telegram
from
foot
brothers
i
mean
legge
arrives
during
the
next
minutes
not
you
to
takee
this
notee
to
brother
andrew
leggee
comprenez
the
boss
was
going
to
send
me
but
he
altered
his
mind
worse
luck
asked
hood
and
now
if
you
in
the
mind
i
box
you
for
half
a
dollar
what
say
he
squared
himself
in
pugilistic
attitude
and
found
amusement
in
delivering
terrific
blows
which
just
stopped
short
of
hood
prominent
features
the
latter
beat
a
retreat
twelve
struck
and
no
telegram
had
arrived
neither
had
dagworthy
returned
to
the
mill
hood
was
indisposed
to
leave
the
envelope
to
be
given
by
other
hands
he
might
as
well
have
the
advantage
of
such
pleasure
as
the
discovery
would
no
doubt
excite
so
he
put
it
safely
in
his
and
hastened
to
catch
the
train
taking
with
him
the
paper
of
sandwiches
which
represented
his
dinner
these
he
would
eat
on
the
way
to
hebsworth
it
was
a
journey
of
ten
miles
lying
at
first
over
green
fields
with
a
colliery
vomiting
blackness
here
and
there
then
through
a
region
of
blight
and
squalor
finally
over
acres
of
streets
amid
the
roar
of
machinery
a
journey
that
would
have
crushed
the
heart
in
one
fresh
from
the
breath
of
heaven
on
sunny
pastures
it
was
a
slow
train
and
there
were
half
a
dozen
stoppages
hood
began
to
eat
his
sandwiches
at
a
point
where
the
train
was
delayed
for
a
few
minutes
by
an
adverse
signal
a
was
close
by
and
the
smoke
from
the
chimney
blew
in
at
the
carriage
windows
giving
a
special
flavour
to
the
bread
and
meat
there
was
a
drunken
soldier
in
the
same
compartment
who
was
being
baited
by
a
couple
of
with
racy
vernacular
not
to
be
rendered
by
the
pen
hood
munched
his
smoky
sandwich
and
with
his
sad
eyes
watched
the
great
wheel
of
the
colliery
revolve
and
the
trucks
rise
and
descend
the
train
moved
on
again
the
banter
between
the
other
three
passengers
was
taking
an
angry
turn
to
escape
the
foul
language
as
far
as
possible
hood
kept
his
head
at
the
window
of
a
sudden
the
drunken
soldier
was
pushed
against
him
and
before
he
could
raise
his
hands
his
hat
had
flown
off
on
the
breeze
he
turned
round
with
angry
remonstrance
the
soldier
had
fallen
back
on
to
the
seat
and
was
grinning
inanely
the
drovers
were
enjoying
the
joke
beyond
measure
lad
one
of
them
cried
doon
it
nah
tha
a
to
buy
him
a
new
for
his
soon
as
we
get
he
got
no
brass
suggested
the
other
guffawing
it
was
the
case
the
soldier
had
a
copper
or
two
at
most
the
drovers
of
course
held
themselves
free
of
responsibility
hood
felt
in
his
own
pocket
but
he
was
well
aware
that
a
shilling
and
was
all
he
carried
with
him
save
the
in
his
yet
it
was
impossible
to
go
through
hebsworth
with
uncovered
head
or
to
present
himself
hatless
at
the
office
of
legge
brothers
already
the
train
was
slackening
speed
to
enter
the
station
would
any
hatter
trust
him
on
his
representing
whence
he
came
he
feared
not
not
the
least
part
of
his
trouble
was
the
thought
of
having
to
buy
a
new
hat
at
all
such
an
expense
was
ill
to
be
borne
just
now
of
course
he
said
to
himself
with
dreary
fatalism
a
mishap
is
sure
to
come
at
the
worst
time
it
was
the
experience
of
his
life
hood
was
a
shy
man
it
was
misery
to
have
attention
drawn
to
himself
as
it
naturally
would
be
as
soon
as
he
stepped
out
on
to
the
platform
but
there
was
no
help
with
a
last
angry
look
at
the
drunken
soldier
he
nerved
himself
to
face
the
ordeal
as
he
walked
hurriedly
out
of
the
crowd
the
cry
sir
fell
upon
his
ears
impossible
to
say
how
he
brought
himself
to
such
a
pitch
of
recklessness
but
in
a
moment
he
was
seated
in
a
hansom
having
bidden
the
driver
take
him
to
the
nearest
hatter
the
agony
of
embarrassment
has
driven
shy
men
to
strange
audacities
but
who
ever
dared
more
than
this
would
be
compelled
to
change
the
whatever
might
be
the
cause
whether
it
was
the
sudden
sense
of
refuge
from
observation
or
the
long
unknown
pleasure
of
riding
in
a
cab
as
he
sped
along
the
streets
he
grew
almost
merry
at
length
he
positively
laughed
at
the
adventure
which
had
befallen
him
it
mattered
nothing
whether
he
gave
dagworthy
the
money
in
a
note
or
in
change
and
on
being
told
the
story
his
employer
might
even
feel
disposed
to
pay
for
the
hat
he
pay
for
the
hat
by
the
time
the
cab
drew
up
hood
had
convinced
himself
of
this
he
was
in
better
spirits
than
he
had
been
for
many
a
day
you
change
me
a
note
were
his
first
words
to
the
hatter
you
ca
i
must
go
elsewhere
i
have
nothing
smaller
the
salesman
hesitated
want
a
silk
hat
but
not
an
expensive
one
a
pen
was
brought
and
hood
was
requested
to
endorse
the
note
what
security
under
the
circumstances
such
a
proceeding
could
give
the
hatter
best
knew
he
appeared
satisfied
and
counted
out
his
sovereigns
hood
paid
the
cabman
and
walked
off
briskly
towards
the
office
of
legge
brothers
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
pavement
as
if
a
shot
had
struck
him
supposing
dagworthy
had
no
recollection
of
a
note
having
been
lost
nor
of
any
note
having
been
lost
and
supposing
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
hood
had
in
reality
found
a
larger
sum
had
invented
the
story
of
the
lost
hat
and
was
returning
a
portion
only
of
his
discovery
to
gain
the
credit
of
honesty
such
an
idea
could
only
possess
the
brain
of
a
man
whose
life
had
been
a
struggle
amid
the
chicaneries
and
despicabilities
of
commerce
who
knew
that
a
man
word
was
never
trusted
where
there
could
enter
the
slightest
suspicion
of
an
advantage
to
himself
in
lying
whose
daily
terror
had
been
lest
some
error
some
luckless
chance
should
put
him
within
the
nets
of
criminality
it
is
the
deepest
curse
of
such
a
life
as
his
that
it
directs
the
imagination
in
channels
of
meanness
and
preoccupies
the
thought
with
sordid
fears
what
would
it
avail
him
in
the
present
instance
to
call
the
shopman
to
witness
the
note
ten
to
one
would
be
paid
away
and
here
also
a
word
was
worth
nothing
but
dagworthy
might
merely
think
such
an
accusation
ay
that
would
be
the
worst
to
lie
henceforth
under
suspicion
of
dishonesty
that
meant
to
lose
his
place
before
long
on
some
pretence
and
he
felt
that
in
spite
of
absolute
sincerity
he
could
not
stand
before
dagworthy
and
tell
his
tale
with
the
face
and
voice
of
an
honest
man
felt
it
with
a
horrible
certainty
in
a
man
of
hood
character
this
state
of
mind
was
perfectly
natural
not
only
was
he
weakly
constructed
but
his
incessant
had
done
him
that
last
wrong
which
social
hardship
can
inflict
upon
the
individual
it
had
undermined
his
having
been
so
often
treated
like
a
dog
he
had
come
to
expect
such
treatment
and
what
was
worse
but
feebly
to
resent
it
he
had
lost
the
conscious
dignity
of
manhood
nay
had
perhaps
never
possessed
it
for
his
battle
had
begun
at
so
early
an
age
the
sense
that
he
was
wretchedly
poor
and
the
knowledge
that
poverty
is
the
mother
of
degradation
made
him
at
any
moment
a
criminal
accused
however
wrongly
it
was
inevitable
that
his
face
should
be
against
him
to
go
to
dagworthy
with
sovereigns
in
his
hand
and
this
story
upon
his
lips
would
be
to
invite
suspicion
by
every
strongest
sign
of
guilt
i
am
representing
the
poor
fellow
thoughts
and
feelings
whether
or
not
dagworthy
would
really
entertain
such
a
suspicion
is
quite
another
matter
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
hood
had
used
for
his
own
purposes
money
which
did
not
belong
to
him
he
did
it
under
the
pressure
of
circumstances
and
had
not
time
to
reflect
till
the
act
was
irrevocable
then
this
horror
came
upon
him
forgetting
his
errand
he
drew
aside
into
a
quieter
street
and
struggled
with
his
anguish
do
you
laugh
at
him
for
his
imbecility
try
first
to
understand
him
but
his
business
must
be
performed
with
trembling
limbs
he
hurried
onwards
and
at
length
reached
the
office
of
legge
brothers
the
member
of
the
firm
to
whom
the
note
which
he
bore
was
addressed
had
but
a
few
minutes
ago
left
the
place
he
would
return
within
an
hour
how
could
the
time
be
spent
he
began
to
wander
aimlessly
about
the
streets
in
passing
a
spot
where
scaffolding
was
erected
before
new
buildings
the
wish
entered
his
mind
that
something
might
fall
and
crush
him
he
thought
of
such
an
end
as
a
blessed
relief
a
hand
was
laid
upon
his
shoulder
and
at
the
touch
his
heart
leaped
as
though
it
would
burst
his
side
he
turned
and
with
starting
eyes
glared
at
the
man
before
him
a
perfect
stranger
he
thought
it
or
is
it
hood
or
his
ghost
the
man
who
spoke
was
of
the
shabbiest
appearance
wearing
an
almost
napless
high
hat
a
coloured
linen
shirt
which
should
have
been
at
the
laundress
no
a
with
only
one
button
low
shoes
terribly
down
at
heel
for
all
that
the
most
man
laughing
at
length
hood
was
capable
of
recognising
him
well
who
on
earth
would
have
expected
to
meet
you
followed
you
half
along
the
street
could
be
sure
afraid
i
startled
you
at
last
old
friend
they
had
known
each
other
as
young
men
and
it
was
now
ten
years
at
least
since
they
had
met
they
were
companions
in
the
difference
between
them
being
that
cheeseman
bore
the
buffets
of
the
world
with
imperturbable
good
humour
but
then
he
had
neither
wife
nor
child
kith
nor
kin
he
had
tried
his
luck
in
all
parts
of
england
and
in
several
other
countries
casual
wards
had
known
him
and
he
had
gained
a
supper
by
fiddling
in
the
streets
many
a
beginning
had
he
made
but
none
led
to
anything
he
seemed
in
truth
to
enjoy
a
haphazard
existence
if
cheeseman
had
possessed
literary
skill
the
story
of
his
life
from
his
own
hand
would
have
been
invaluable
it
is
a
misfortune
that
the
men
who
are
richest
in
are
those
who
would
never
dream
of
using
it
they
were
passing
a
cheeseman
caught
his
friend
by
the
arm
and
in
spite
of
resistance
drew
him
in
threes
of
gin
hot
was
his
order
old
drink
hood
my
boy
the
drink
that
has
saved
me
from
despair
a
thousand
times
how
many
times
have
you
and
i
kept
up
each
other
pecker
over
a
three
of
gin
you
do
look
well
you
wanted
old
cheeseman
to
cheer
you
up
things
bad
why
damn
it
of
course
things
are
bad
when
were
they
anything
else
with
you
and
me
eh
your
wife
how
is
she
remember
me
to
her
will
you

took
to
me
but
never
mind
that
and
the
little
girl
how
the
little
girl

and
well
please
god
more
than
a
little
girl
now

hood
doing
well
i
glad
to
say
she

governess

an
excellent
place
in
london
do
say
so
i
never
was
so
glad
to
hear
anything
in
my
life
ah
but
hood

me
behind
old
friend
with
the
little
girl
doing
so
well

yourself
a
poor
devil

ca
upon
my
soul
i
ought
to
have
married
yes
i
should
ha
married
long
ago
it
a
been
the
making
of
me
it
the
sole
speculation
i
do
believe
that
i
have
tried
ah
but
i
got
something
before
me
now
what
say
you
to
a
patent
that
any
man
can
carry
round
his
waist
upon
my
soul
i
got
it
i
going
to
london
about
it
as
soon
as
i
can
get
my
fare
and
that
i
shall
have
please
god
brings
you
to
hebsworth
do
care
much
to
talk
about
it
in
a
public
place
replied
cheeseman
with
caution
which
contrasted
comically
with
his
loud
tone
hitherto
a
little
matter
but
well
we
say
nothing
about
it
i
may
communicate
with
you
some
day
and
you
do
you
live
here
hood
gave
an
account
of
his
position
under
the
influence
of
the
glass
of
spirits
and
of
the
real
pleasure
it
gave
him
to
see
one
of
the
very
few
men
he
had
ever
called
friend
he
had
cast
aside
his
cares
for
the
moment
they
went
forth
presently
from
the
bar
and
after
a
few
paces
cheeseman
took
his
friend
by
the
coat
collar
and
drew
him
aside
as
if
to
impart
a
matter
of
consequence
threes
of
gin
he
said
with
a
roll
of
the
eye
which
gave
his
face
a
singularly
humorous
expression
sixpence
a
tanner
hood
was
the
last
coin
i
possessed
it
was
to
have
purchased
dinner
a
beefsteak
pudding
with
cabbage
and
potatoes
but
what
o
that
when
you
and
i
meet
we
drink
to
old
times
there
no
getting
out
of
that
hood
laughed
for
once
in
a
really
natural
way
his
usual
abstemiousness
made
the
gin
potent
he
said
confess
to
feeling
hungry
myself
i
only
had
a
sandwich
come
along
we
have
dinner
together
mean
it
old
friend
cried
the
other
with
irrepressible
delight
course
i
mean
it
you
do
think
i
let
you
spend
your
last
coin
and
send
you
off
dinnerless
things
are
bad
but
not
quite
as
bad
as
that
i
as
hungry
as
a
hunter
where
is
there
an
they
found
one
at
a
little
distance
must
be
beefsteak
pudding
hood
whispered
cheeseman
as
they
entered
set
my
heart
on
that
whatever
else
you
like
but
a
beefsteak
pudding
to
start
with
the
article
was
procurable
smoking
juicy
cheeseman
made
an
incision
then
laid
down
his
knife
and
gloated
over
his
plate
he
said
with
much
solemnity
done
me
many
a
kindness
old
friend
but
this
caps
all
i
bound
to
you
for
life
and
death
i
should
have
wandered
about
these
streets
a
starving
man
the
other
laughed
still
he
had
a
fit
of
laughter
on
him
he
had
not
laughed
so
since
he
was
young
is
my
drink
hood
remarked
cheeseman
suggestively
has
body
and
i
need
the
support
they
each
had
a
pint
served
in
the
native
pewter
when
cheeseman
had
taken
a
deep
draught
he
leaned
forward
across
the
table
i
do
forget
it
never
you
believe
that
i
forget
it
however
appearances
may
be
against
me
what
give
me
the
mustard
as
soon
as
you
can
spare
it
ha
ha
note
hood
dropped
his
knife
and
fork
on
earth
up
you
look
just
like
you
did
when
i
clapped
you
the
shoulder
your
nerves
are
out
of
order
old
friend
so
they
are
i
know
now
what
you
mean
i
could
for
the
life
of
me
think
what
you
were
talking
about
think
i
forget
it
pursued
the
other
after
a
mouthful
twelve
years
last
easter
since
you
lent
me
that
note
and
it
been
on
my
conscience
ever
since
but
i
shall
repay
it
never
you
fear
but
i
repay
it
did
i
mention
a
that
any
man
can
wear
round
his
waist
hush
wait
a
month
or
two
let
me
make
a
note
of
your
address
whilst
i
think
of
it
this
pudding
hot
but
it
a
fault
on
the
right
side
and
time
mend
it
you
would
mind
i
daresay
being
my
agent
for
dunfield
for
the
you
know
communicate
with
you
do
fear
a
hot
meal
in
the
middle
of
the
day
was
a
luxury
long
unknown
to
hood
now
and
again
the
thought
of
what
he
was
doing
flashed
across
him
but
mere
bodily
solace
made
his
conscience
dull
as
the
meal
proceeded
he
even
began
to
justify
himself
was
he
never
to
know
an
hour
enjoyment
was
his
life
to
be
unbroken
hardship
what
if
he
had
borrowed
a
few
shillings
without
leave
somehow
difficulties
would
be
got
over
why
at
the
very
worst
emily
would
gladly
lend
him
a
pound
he
began
to
talk
of
emily
to
praise
her
to
wax
warm
in
the
recounting
of
her
goodness
her
affection
what
man
living
had
so
clever
and
so
loving
a
daughter
what
i
said
hood
put
in
cheeseman
with
a
shake
of
the
head
left
me
behind
you
got
into
smooth
water
the
old
partnership
of
is
broken
up
well
well
i
ought
to
have
married
it
been
my
one
mistake
in
life
it
none
too
late
yet
cried
hood
merrily
too
late
powers
defend
us
what
have
i
got
to
marry
on
the
yes
to
be
sure
the
well
we
see
wait
till
things
are
set
going
perhaps
you
right
perhaps
it
is
too
late
and
hood
could
manage
one
single
piece
could
you
to
be
sure
there
always
an
archway
to
be
found
when
night
comes
on
but
i
pretend
to
like
it
i
always
try
to
manage
a
bed
at
least
once
a
week
no
no
not
if
there
the
least
difficulty
times
are
hard
i
know
i
rather
say
not
another
word
about
it
take
the
and
have
done
with
it
why
cheered
me
up
many
a
i
feel
better
than
i
did
do
i
look
it
i
feel
as
if
i
some
warmth
in
my
body
what
say
you
cheeseman
more
come
old
friend
that
speaking
feelingly
you
should
try
me
in
that
way
you
know
i
should
like
to
suggest
a
pint
with
a
scrap
of
cheese
eh
no
no
follow
your
own
counsel
boy
half
a
pint
be
it
but
the
suggestion
was
accepted
then
at
length
it
occurred
to
hood
that
time
must
be
wearing
away
he
spoke
of
the
obligation
he
was
under
to
finish
his
business
and
return
to
dunfield
as
soon
as
possible
cheeseman
declared
himself
the
last
man
to
stand
in
the
way
of
business
they
left
the
and
walked
together
part
of
the
way
to
the
office
of
legge
brothers
friend
i
grateful
to
you
said
cheeseman
when
at
length
they
parted
got
your
address
and
you
shall
hear
from
me
i
a
notion
it
wo
be
so
long
before
we
meet
again
in
any
case
another
day
to
look
back
upon
i
little
thought
of
it
when
i
spent
on
my
breakfast
this
morning
and
left
sixpence
for
dinner
it
a
rum
world
eh
hood
and
god
bless
you
hood
hurried
on
to
the
office
received
his
reply
and
proceeded
to
the
station
he
had
more
than
half
an
hour
to
wait
for
a
train
he
took
a
seat
in
the
and
began
to
examine
the
money
in
his
pocket
to
ascertain
exactly
the
sum
he
would
have
to
replace
the
deficit
amounted
to
a
little
less
than
eighteen
shillings
after
all
it
was
very
unlikely
that
dagworthy
would
offer
to
bear
the
expense
of
the
lost
hat
say
that
a
pound
had
to
be
restored
he
was
in
the
comfortable
mood
following
upon
unusual
indulgence
of
the
appetite
in
which
the
mind
handles
in
a
free
and
easy
way
the
thoughts
it
is
wont
to
entertain
with
unquestionable
gravity
when
it
has
as
it
were
a
slippery
hold
on
the
facts
of
life
and
constructs
a
subjective
world
of
genial
accommodations
a
pound
to
restore
on
the
other
hand
nine
pounds
in
pocket
the
sight
of
the
sovereigns
was
working
upon
his
imagination
already
touched
to
a
warmer
life
than
was
its
habit
nine
pounds
would
go
a
long
way
towards
solving
the
financial
difficulties
of
the
year
it
would
considerably
more
than
replace
the
lacking
rent
of
the
house
in
barnhill
would
replace
it
and
pay
as
well
the
increased
rent
of
the
house
at
banbrigg
for
twelve
months
to
come
looked
at
in
this
way
the
money
became
a
great
temptation
his
wife
how
explain
to
her
such
a
windfall
for
it
was
of
course
impossible
to
use
it
secretly
there
was
a
way
seemingly
of
providing
if
only
he
could
bring
himself
to
the
lie
direct
and
shameless
after
all
a
lie
that
would
injure
no
mortal
as
far
as
dagworthy
was
concerned
the
money
had
long
since
become
the
property
of
nobody
dagworthy
did
not
even
know
that
this
sum
existed
if
ever
missed
it
must
have
been
put
out
of
mind
long
ago
and
very
possibly
it
had
never
belonged
to
dagworthy
some
cashier
or
other
clerk
might
just
as
well
have
lost
it
hood
played
with
these
speculations
he
did
not
put
to
himself
the
plain
alternative
shall
i
keep
the
money
or
shall
i
give
it
up
he
merely
let
a
series
of
reflections
pass
over
his
mind
as
he
lay
back
on
the
cushioned
seat
experiencing
an
agreeable
drowsiness
at
the
moment
of
finding
the
note
he
would
have
handed
it
over
to
his
employer
without
a
thought
it
would
perhaps
not
even
have
occurred
to
him
to
regret
that
it
was
not
his
own
but
during
the
last
three
hours
a
singular
chain
of
circumstances
had
led
to
this
result
it
was
just
as
possible
as
not
that
hood
would
keep
the
coins
in
his
pocket
and
say
nothing
about
them
it
was
time
to
go
to
the
train
almost
with
the
first
moving
of
the
carriages
he
fell
into
a
doze
a
sense
of
mental
uneasiness
roused
him
now
and
then
but
only
for
a
few
moments
together
he
slumbered
on
till
dunfield
was
reached
at
the
entrance
to
the
mill
he
was
in
fierce
conflict
with
himself
as
is
usually
the
case
in
like
circumstances
the
sleepy
journey
had
resulted
in
bodily
uneasiness
he
had
a
slight
headache
was
thirsty
felt
indisposed
to
return
to
work
when
he
had
all
but
crossed
the
threshold
he
turned
sharply
back
and
entered
a
little
a
few
yards
away
an
extraordinary
thing
for
him
to
do
but
he
felt
that
a
small
glass
of
spirits
would
help
him
to
quieter
nerves
or
at
all
events
would
sustain
his
unusual
exhilaration
till
the
interview
with
dagworthy
was
over
at
the
very
door
of
the
office
he
had
not
decided
whether
it
should
be
silence
or
restitution
you
hood
dagworthy
asked
looking
up
from
a
letter
he
was
writing
rather
a
long
time
have
you
the
tone
was
unusually
indulgent
hood
felt
an
accession
of
confidence
he
explained
naturally
the
cause
of
his
delay
right
was
the
reply
as
dagworthy
took
the
note
which
his
correspondent
had
sent
hood
was
in
his
own
room
and
the
money
was
still
in
his
pocket
he
did
not
set
out
to
walk
home
with
his
usual
cheerfulness
that
evening
his
headache
had
grown
worse
and
he
wished
wished
at
every
step
he
took
that
the
lie
he
had
to
tell
to
his
wife
was
over
and
done
with
there
was
no
repentance
of
the
decision
which
it
seemed
on
looking
back
he
had
arrived
at
involuntarily
the
coin
which
made
his
pocket
heavy
meant
joy
to
those
at
home
and
if
he
got
it
wrongfully
the
wrong
was
so
dubious
so
shadowy
that
it
vanished
in
comparison
with
the
good
that
would
be
done
it
was
not
he
said
to
himself
as
if
he
had
committed
a
theft
to
dissipate
the
proceeds
like
that
young
fellow
who
ran
away
from
the
dunfield
and
county
bank
some
months
ago
and
was
caught
in
london
with
disreputable
associates
here
was
a
note
lying
one
might
say
by
the
very
roadside
and
it
would
save
a
family
from
privation
abstractly
it
was
wrong
yes
it
was
wrong
but
would
abstract
right
feed
him
and
pay
his
rent
for
the
year
to
come
hood
had
reached
this
stage
in
his
he
strengthened
himself
by
protest
against
the
order
of
things
his
headache
nursed
the
tendency
to
an
active
discontent
to
which
as
a
rule
his
temperament
did
not
lend
itself
but
there
remained
the
telling
of
the
lie
how
he
wished
that
emily
were
not
at
home
to
lie
before
emily
that
was
the
hardest
part
of
his
task
he
could
not
respect
his
wife
but
before
emily
since
her
earliest
companionship
with
him
he
had
watched
his
words
scrupulously
as
a
little
girl
she
had
so
impressed
him
with
the
purity
of
her
heart
that
his
love
for
her
had
been
the
nearest
approach
he
ever
knew
to
the
spirit
of
worship
and
since
her
attainment
of
mental
and
moral
independence
his
reverence
for
her
had
not
been
unmixed
with
awe
when
her
eyes
met
his
he
felt
the
presence
of
a
nature
indefinitely
nobler
than
his
own
not
seldom
he
marvelled
in
his
dim
way
that
such
a
one
called
him
father
could
he
ever
after
this
day
approach
her
with
the
old
confidence
nay
he
feared
her
his
belief
in
her
insight
was
almost
a
superstition
would
she
not
read
the
falsehood
upon
his
face
strange
state
of
mind
at
one
and
the
same
time
he
wished
that
he
had
thought
of
emily
sooner
and
was
glad
that
he
had
not
that
weight
in
his
pocket
was
after
all
a
joyous
one
and
to
have
been
conscious
of
emily
as
he
now
was
might
would
have
made
him
by
so
much
a
poorer
man
she
as
usual
was
at
the
door
to
meet
him
her
face
even
ladder
than
its
wont
for
this
morning
there
had
been
at
the
a
letter
from
switzerland
how
she
loved
that
old
name
of
helvetia
printed
on
the
stamps
wilfrid
wrote
with
ever
fuller
assurance
that
his
mind
was
growing
and
emily
knew
that
he
would
not
tell
her
other
than
the
honest
truth
for
wilfrid
scrupulous
honesty
she
would
have
vouched
as
for
her
father
look
dreadfully
worn
out
she
said
as
hood
bent
his
head
in
entering
am
dear
i
have
been
to
hebsworth
among
other
things
i
hope
you
had
dinner
there
he
laughed
should
think
i
had
it
was
one
of
mrs
hood
bad
days
she
refused
to
leave
the
kitchen
emily
had
tried
to
cheer
her
during
the
afternoon
but
in
vain
there
had
been
a
misunderstanding
with
the
neighbour
that
lady
having
expressed
herself
rather
decidedly
with
regard
to
an
incursion
made
into
her
premises
by
the
hoods
cat
speaks
to
me
as
if
i
was
a
mere
mrs
hood
exclaimed
when
emily
endeavoured
to
soothe
her
and
what
else
am
i
indeed
there
was
a
time
when
no
one
would
have
ventured
to
speak
so
how
can
you
be
troubled
by
what
such
a
woman
says
i
know
i
am
in
the
wrong
emily
you
always
make
me
see
that
so
emily
had
retreated
to
the
upper
room
and
mrs
hood
resenting
neglect
more
even
than
contradiction
was
resolved
to
sit
in
the
kitchen
till
bedtime
hood
was
glad
when
he
heard
of
this
you
pour
out
my
tea
emily
he
said
in
an
undertone
go
and
speak
to
mother
for
a
few
moments
i
have
news
that
will
please
her
he
went
into
the
kitchen
and
in
silence
began
to
count
sovereigns
down
upon
the
table
just
behind
his
wife
who
sat
over
some
sewing
and
had
not
yet
spoken
at
the
ring
of
each
coin
his
heart
throbbed
painfully
he
fully
realised
for
the
first
time
what
he
had
done
at
the
ring
of
the
fifth
sovereign
mrs
hood
turned
her
head
that
she
asked
snappishly
he
went
on
counting
till
the
nine
were
displayed
is
it
she
repeated
do
you
fidget
me
so
never
guess
hood
answered
laughing
hoarsely
had
to
go
to
hebsworth
and
who
ever
do
you
think
i
met
there
why
old
cheeseman
he
paused
he
no
i
never
believe
he
paid
his
debt
said
his
wife
with
bitter
congratulation
for
years
the
name
of
cheeseman
had
been
gall
upon
her
tongue
even
now
she
had
not
entirely
ceased
to
allude
to
him
when
she
wished
to
throw
especial
force
of
sarcasm
into
a
reminiscence
of
her
earlier
days
a
woman
powers
in
the
direction
of
envenomed
memory
are
terrible
have
said
it
was
hood
reply
under
his
breath
was
providential
what
did
i
do
but
go
and
lose
my
hat
out
of
the
window
of
the
train
had
it
knocked
off
by
a
drunken
fellow
in
fact
but
for
this
money
i
should
have
gone
about
hebsworth
bareheaded
and
come
home
so
too
new
hat
there
a
pretty
penny
gone
well
it
too
much
to
hope
that
any
good
luck
should
come
without
bad
at
the
same
time
now
you
wo
fret
so
much
about
the
rent
jane
he
laid
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
it
was
a
movement
of
tenderness
such
as
had
not
come
to
him
for
years
he
felt
the
need
of
sympathy
he
could
have
begged
her
to
give
him
a
kind
look
but
she
had
resumed
her
sewing
her
fingers
were
not
quite
steady
that
was
all
he
left
the
money
on
the
table
and
went
to
emily
in
the
she
was
sitting
at
the
table
waiting
for
him
with
her
kindly
eyes
what
has
the
wise
woman
been
doing
all
day
he
asked
trying
in
vain
to
overcome
that
terrible
fluttering
at
his
side
which
caught
his
breath
and
made
him
feel
weak
they
talked
for
some
minutes
then
footsteps
were
heard
approaching
from
the
kitchen
mrs
hood
entered
with
her
sewing
she
always
took
the
very
coarsest
for
such
days
as
this
and
sat
at
a
little
distance
from
the
table
as
the
conversation
had
nothing
to
do
with
cheeseman
debt
she
grew
impatient
you
told
emily
she
asked
i
have
you
shall
do
that
hood
tried
to
eat
the
while
the
morsels
became
like
sawdust
in
his
mouth
and
all
but
choked
him
he
tried
to
laugh
the
silence
which
followed
his
effort
was
ghastly
to
him
see
it
never
does
to
believe
too
ill
of
a
man
he
said
when
he
found
emily
look
upon
him
mrs
hood
grew
mere
at
her
ease
and
to
his
relief
began
to
talk
freely
emily
tortured
him
by
observing
that
he
had
no
appetite
he
excused
himself
by
telling
of
his
dinner
in
hebsworth
and
as
soon
as
possible
left
the
table
he
went
upstairs
and
hoped
to
find
solitude
for
a
time
in
the
garret
emily
joined
him
however
before
long
at
her
entrance
he
caught
up
the
first
bottle
his
hand
fell
upon
and
seemed
to
be
examining
it
is
that
emily
asked
noticing
his
intentness
which
in
reality
had
no
meaning
oh
cyanide
of
potassium
i
was
looking
no
it
nothing
will
you
read
me
something
for
half
an
hour
emily
by
this
means
he
would
avoid
talking
and
he
knew
that
the
girl
was
always
delighted
by
the
request
she
generally
read
poetry
of
a
kind
she
thought
might
touch
him
longing
to
establish
more
of
intellectual
sympathy
between
him
and
herself
so
she
did
hood
scarcely
followed
after
the
first
line
he
became
lost
in
feverish
brooding
when
she
laid
the
volume
down
he
looked
up
and
held
out
his
hand
to
her
she
at
all
events
would
not
disregard
his
caress
indeed
emily
took
the
hand
and
kissed
it
then
began
one
of
the
more
intimate
conversations
which
sometimes
took
place
between
them
emily
was
driven
now
and
then
to
endeavour
to
make
clear
to
him
her
inner
life
to
speak
of
her
ideals
her
intellectual
convictions
he
listened
always
with
an
air
of
deep
humility
very
touching
in
a
parent
before
a
child
her
meaning
was
often
dark
to
his
sight
but
he
strove
hard
to
comprehend
and
every
word
she
uttered
had
for
him
a
gospel
sanction
his
thoughts
strayed
her
voice
was
nothing
but
the
reproach
of
his
own
soul
the
high
or
tender
words
were
but
an
emphasis
of
condemnation
reiterated
pitiless
she
was
speaking
thus
out
of
her
noble
heart
to
him
him
the
miserable
hypocrite
he
pretended
to
listen
and
to
approve
his
being
was
a
loathed
burden
if
she
had
spoken
thus
last
night
surely
her
voice
would
have
dwelt
with
him
through
the
hour
of
temptation
oh
could
it
not
be
morning
again
and
the
day
yet
to
live
the
clock
below
wheezed
out
nine
strokes
as
if
in
answer
chapter
x
at
the
sword
point
dagworthy
in
these
days
could
scarcely
be
deemed
a
man
with
plenitude
of
interacting
motives
of
contrasting
impulses
of
varying
affections
he
was
become
one
passion
a
personified
appetite
he
went
through
his
routine
at
the
mill
and
elsewhere
in
a
mechanical
way
all
the
time
his
instincts
and
habits
subjugated
themselves
to
the
frenzy
which
chafed
at
the
centres
of
his
life
in
his
face
you
saw
the
monomaniac
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
his
lips
had
a
parched
yellowness
of
tone
his
skin
seemed
dry
and
burning
through
the
day
he
talked
gave
orders
wrote
letters
and
by
mere
force
of
lifelong
habit
much
in
his
usual
way
at
night
he
wandered
about
the
heath
now
at
a
great
pace
driven
by
his
passions
now
loitering
stumbling
between
dark
and
dawn
he
was
fifty
times
in
front
of
the
hoods
house
he
watched
the
extinguishing
of
the
lights
in
window
after
window
and
when
all
were
gone
made
away
with
curses
on
his
lips
only
to
return
an
hour
later
to
torture
himself
with
conjecture
which
room
might
be
emily
his
sufferings
were
unutterable
what
devil
he
groaned
had
sent
upon
him
this
torment
he
wished
he
were
as
in
former
days
when
the
indifference
he
felt
towards
his
wife
undeniable
beauty
had
as
it
seemed
involved
all
womankind
in
those
times
he
could
not
have
conceived
a
madness
such
as
this
how
had
it
arisen
was
it
a
physical
illness
was
it
madness
in
truth
or
the
beginning
of
it
why
had
it
not
taken
him
four
months
ago
when
he
met
this
girl
at
the
baxendales
but
he
remembered
that
even
then
she
had
attracted
him
strangely
he
had
quitted
the
others
to
talk
to
her
he
must
have
been
prepared
to
conceive
this
frantic
passion
on
coming
together
with
her
again
love
alone
so
felt
and
so
frustrated
would
have
been
bad
enough
it
was
the
added
pang
of
jealousy
that
made
it
a
fierce
agony
it
was
well
that
the
man
she
had
chosen
was
not
within
his
reach
his
mood
was
that
of
a
murderer
the
very
heat
and
vigour
of
his
physical
frame
the
native
violence
of
his
temper
disposed
him
to
brute
fury
if
an
instinct
such
as
this
once
became
acute
and
the
imaginative
energy
which
lurked
in
him
a
sort
of
undeveloped
genius
was
another
source
of
suffering
beyond
that
which
ordinary
men
endure
he
was
a
fine
creature
in
these
hours
colossal
tragic
it
needed
this
experience
to
bring
out
all
there
was
of
great
and
exceptional
in
his
character
he
was
not
of
those
who
can
quit
the
scene
of
their
fruitless
misery
and
find
forgetfulness
at
a
distance
every
searing
stroke
drove
him
more
desperately
in
pursuit
of
his
end
he
was
further
from
abandoning
it
now
that
he
knew
another
stood
in
his
way
than
he
would
have
been
if
emily
had
merely
rejected
him
he
would
not
yield
her
to
another
man
he
swore
to
himself
that
he
would
not
let
it
cost
him
and
her
what
it
might
he
had
seen
her
again
with
his
glass
from
the
windows
of
the
mill
had
scarcely
moved
his
eyes
from
her
for
an
hour
a
hope
came
to
him
that
she
might
by
chance
walk
at
evening
on
the
heath
but
he
was
disappointed
emily
indeed
had
long
shunned
walks
in
that
direction
he
had
no
other
means
of
meeting
her
yet
he
anguished
for
a
glimpse
of
her
face
he
knew
a
cruel
assuagement
of
his
torture
he
had
returned
from
his
short
absence
with
a
resolve
to
risk
an
attempt
which
was
only
not
entirely
base
by
virtue
of
the
passion
which
inspired
it
and
it
appeared
to
him
that
his
stratagem
had
succeeded
scruples
he
had
indeed
known
but
not
at
all
of
the
weight
they
would
have
possessed
for
most
men
and
this
not
only
because
of
his
reckless
determination
to
win
by
any
means
his
birth
and
breeding
enabled
him
to
accept
meanness
as
almost
a
virtue
in
many
of
the
relations
and
transactions
of
life
the
trickery
and
low
cunning
of
the
mercantile
world
was
in
his
blood
it
would
come
out
when
great
occasion
saw
use
for
it
even
in
the
service
of
love
he
believed
it
was
leading
him
to
success
certainly
the
first
result
that
he
aimed
at
was
assured
and
he
could
not
imagine
a
subsequent
obstacle
he
would
not
have
admitted
that
he
was
wronging
the
man
whom
he
made
his
tool
if
honesty
failed
under
temptation
it
was
honesty
own
ten
to
one
he
himself
would
have
fallen
into
such
a
trap
in
similar
circumstances
he
was
quite
free
from
pharisaical
prejudice
had
he
not
reckoned
on
mere
human
nature
in
devising
his
plan
nor
would
the
result
be
cruel
for
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
repay
a
hundredfold
all
temporary
pain
there
were
no
limits
to
the
kindness
he
was
capable
of
when
once
he
had
emily
for
his
wife
she
and
hers
should
be
overwhelmed
with
the
fruits
of
his
devotion
it
was
to
no
gross
or
commonplace
future
that
the
looked
forward
there
were
things
in
him
of
which
he
was
beginning
to
be
conscious
which
would
lead
him
he
could
not
yet
see
whither
dunfield
was
no
home
for
emily
he
knew
it
and
felt
that
he
too
would
henceforth
have
need
of
a
larger
circle
of
life
he
was
rich
enough
and
by
transferring
his
business
to
other
hands
he
could
become
yet
richer
gaining
freedom
at
the
same
time
no
disappointment
would
be
in
store
for
him
as
in
his
former
marriage
looking
back
on
that
he
saw
now
how
boyish
he
had
been
how
easily
duped
there
was
not
even
the
excuse
of
love
he
held
her
gained
what
choice
would
she
have
with
the
alternative
to
be
put
before
her
it
was
strange
that
in
spite
of
what
should
have
been
sympathetic
intelligence
he
made
a
slight
account
of
that
love
which
as
she
told
him
she
had
already
bestowed
in
fact
he
refused
to
dwell
upon
the
thought
of
it
it
would
have
maddened
him
in
earnest
who
could
say
it
was
very
possible
she
had
told
him
a
falsehood
it
was
quite
allowable
in
any
woman
to
escape
from
a
difficult
position
in
his
heart
he
did
not
believe
this
knowing
her
better
though
his
practical
knowledge
of
her
was
so
slight
but
it
was
one
of
the
devices
by
which
he
mitigated
his
suffering
now
and
then
if
the
engagement
existed
it
was
probably
one
of
those
which
contemplated
years
of
waiting
otherwise
why
should
she
have
kept
silence
about
it
at
home
in
any
case
he
held
her
how
could
she
escape
him
he
did
not
fear
appeals
to
his
compassion
against
such
assaults
he
was
well
armed
emily
pleading
at
his
feet
would
not
be
a
picture
likely
to
induce
him
to
relax
his
purpose
she
could
not
take
to
flight
the
very
terms
of
his
control
restrained
her
there
might
be
flaws
in
his
case
legally
speaking
but
the
hoods
were
in
no
position
to
profit
by
these
seeing
that
in
order
to
do
so
they
must
begin
by
facing
ruin
emily
was
assuredly
his
was
friday
he
knew
from
talk
with
the
cartwrights
that
jessie
lessons
were
on
alternate
days
and
as
he
had
seen
the
two
in
the
garden
this
morning
there
would
be
no
lesson
on
the
morrow
it
was
not
easy
to
devise
a
plot
for
a
private
interview
with
emily
yet
he
must
see
her
tomorrow
and
of
course
alone
a
few
words
with
her
would
suffice
to
call
upon
her
at
the
house
would
be
only
his
last
resource
he
felt
assured
that
she
had
not
spoken
to
her
parents
of
the
scene
in
the
garden
several
reasons
supported
this
belief
especially
the
reflection
that
emily
would
desire
to
spare
her
father
the
anxieties
of
a
difficult
position
taking
this
for
granted
his
relations
with
her
must
still
be
kept
secret
in
order
to
avoid
risking
his
impunity
in
the
tactics
he
counted
upon
his
hope
was
that
she
would
leave
the
house
alone
in
the
course
of
the
morning
it
has
been
mentioned
that
a
railway
bridge
crossed
the
road
a
short
distance
beyond
the
hoods
house
on
the
embankment
beyond
this
bridge
twenty
or
thirty
yards
from
the
road
was
a
cluster
of
small
trees
and
shrubs
railed
in
from
the
grass
which
elsewhere
grew
upon
the
slope
and
from
the
field
at
its
foot
here
just
hidden
behind
a
hawthorn
bush
and
a
climbing
bramble
dagworthy
placed
himself
shortly
before
eight
on
saturday
morning
having
approached
the
spot
by
a
long
circuit
of
trespass
from
this
position
he
had
a
complete
view
of
the
house
he
wished
to
watch
he
came
thus
early
because
he
thought
it
possible
that
emily
accompanied
her
father
on
his
morning
walk
into
dunfield
in
which
case
he
would
follow
at
a
distance
and
find
his
opportunity
as
the
girl
returned
there
had
been
rain
in
the
night
and
his
passage
through
the
bushes
covered
him
with
moisture
the
thick
grass
too
in
which
he
stood
was
so
wet
that
before
long
his
feet
grew
damp
and
cold
he
was
little
mindful
of
bodily
discomfort
never
moving
his
eyes
for
a
moment
from
the
door
which
would
give
emily
to
his
view
he
knew
nothing
but
the
impatience
which
made
it
incredible
that
his
watch
could
keep
pace
with
time
he
seemed
to
have
been
waiting
for
hours
when
yet
it
was
only
eight
but
at
length
the
door
opened
he
strained
his
sight
across
the
distance
but
with
no
reward
hood
left
the
house
alone
and
walked
off
quickly
in
the
direction
of
dunfield
he
must
wait
it
might
happen
that
emily
would
not
quit
home
at
all
during
the
early
part
of
the
day
but
he
must
wait
on
the
chance
he
dreaded
lest
rain
should
fall
which
would
naturally
keep
her
within
doors
but
by
nine
the
sky
had
cleared
and
he
saw
the
leaves
above
him
drying
in
the
sunlight
inactivity
was
at
all
times
intolerable
to
him
to
stand
thus
for
hours
was
an
exercise
of
impatient
patience
which
only
his
relentless
passion
made
possible
his
body
yielded
to
a
sort
of
numbness
whilst
the
suffering
expectancy
of
his
mind
only
grew
keener
he
durst
not
avert
his
eyes
from
the
door
for
an
instant
his
sight
ached
and
dazzled
still
he
waited
at
eleven
emily
came
forth
a
savage
delight
seized
him
as
he
watched
her
cross
the
patch
of
garden
at
the
gate
she
hesitated
a
moment
then
took
the
way
neither
to
the
heath
nor
to
dunfield
but
crossed
to
the
lane
which
led
to
pendal
from
his
dagworthy
could
follow
her
so
far
and
with
ecstasy
he
told
himself
that
she
must
be
going
to
the
castle
hill
she
carried
a
book
in
her
hand
at
length
he
moved
his
limbs
had
stiffened
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
embankment
thence
he
could
see
the
whole
track
of
the
lane
which
went
indeed
almost
parallel
with
the
railway
line
he
walked
in
the
same
direction
keeping
at
some
distance
behind
emily
before
reaching
the
village
of
pendal
he
had
to
cross
a
field
and
enter
the
lane
itself
there
was
now
the
danger
that
the
girl
might
look
back
but
she
did
not
she
was
reading
as
she
walked
and
continued
to
do
so
the
whole
way
to
the
stile
which
led
into
the
castle
hill
but
now
it
mattered
little
if
she
turned
her
head
he
let
her
pass
the
stile
and
himself
paused
before
following
he
was
agitated
that
which
he
was
about
to
do
seemed
harder
than
he
had
imagined
he
had
a
horrible
fear
lest
his
resolution
might
fail
at
the
last
moment
the
brute
in
him
for
an
instant
almost
slept
the
woman
in
the
field
yonder
was
not
only
the
object
of
his
vehement
desire
all
the
nobler
possibilities
of
his
nature
united
to
worship
her
as
the
highest
and
holiest
he
knew
in
his
heart
was
a
subtle
temptation
the
voice
of
very
love
bidding
him
cast
himself
at
her
feet
and
sue
but
for
the
grace
of
so
much
human
kindness
as
would
make
life
without
her
endurable
he
remembered
the
which
had
come
upon
him
when
he
tried
to
tell
her
of
his
love
the
offering
had
seemed
so
gross
so
unworthy
to
be
brought
before
her
would
it
not
be
the
same
now
he
dreaded
her
power
to
protect
herself
the
secret
might
of
purity
which
made
him
shrink
at
her
steady
gaze
but
he
had
gone
through
much
in
the
last
fortnight
the
brute
forces
had
grown
strong
by
habit
of
he
looked
up
and
the
fact
that
emily
had
gone
from
his
sight
stung
him
into
pursuit
she
was
sitting
where
she
had
sat
with
wilfrid
on
the
fallen
tree
the
book
lay
at
her
side
and
she
was
giving
herself
to
memory
treading
on
the
grass
he
did
not
attract
her
attention
till
he
almost
stood
before
her
then
she
looked
at
him
and
at
once
rose
he
expected
signs
of
apprehension
or
embarrassment
but
she
seemed
calm
she
had
accustomed
herself
to
think
of
him
and
could
no
longer
be
taken
by
surprise
she
was
too
in
the
strength
of
the
thoughts
which
he
had
disturbed
he
fed
his
eyes
upon
her
and
kept
so
long
silent
that
emily
cheek
coloured
and
she
half
turned
away
then
he
spoke
abruptly
yet
with
humility
which
the
consciousness
of
his
purpose
could
not
overcome
know
that
i
have
been
away
since
i
saw
you
last
i
tried
to
put
you
out
of
my
mind
i
could
do
it
and
i
am
driven
back
to
you
hoped
we
should
not
meet
again
like
this
dagworthy
emily
replied
in
a
low
voice
but
firmly
she
felt
that
her
was
to
be
tested
to
the
uttermost
but
she
was
better
able
to
control
herself
than
at
the
last
interview
the
sense
of
being
passionately
sought
can
not
but
enhance
a
woman
dignity
in
her
own
eyes
and
emily
was
not
without
perception
of
the
features
in
dagworthy
character
which
made
him
anything
but
a
lover
to
be
contemned
she
dreaded
him
and
could
not
turn
away
as
from
one
who
tormented
her
out
of
mere
can
not
ask
you
to
pardon
me
he
returned
however
often
you
asked
me
to
leave
you
i
should
pay
no
heed
i
am
here
because
i
help
myself
i
mean
what
i
say
i
ca
i
ca
help
it
since
you
told
me
there
was
no
hope
i
seem
to
have
been
in
hell
these
are
not
words
to
use
to
you
i
know
it
it
is
that
i
do
respect
you
but
because
i
must
speak
what
i
feel
look
i
am
worn
out
with
suffering
i
feel
as
if
it
would
take
but
a
little
more
to
kill
me
strong
man
as
i
am
you
do
think
i
find
a
pleasure
in
coming
and
facing
that
look
you
have
i
do
know
that
i
ever
saw
the
man
i
could
meet
but
before
you
i
feel
i
ca
put
it
into
words
but
i
feel
i
should
like
to
hide
my
face
still
i
have
come
i
have
followed
you
here
it
more
than
i
can
do
to
give
you
up
at
the
last
words
he
half
sobbed
her
fear
of
him
would
not
allow
emily
to
feel
deep
distress
but
she
was
awed
by
the
terrible
evidence
of
what
he
endured
she
could
not
at
once
find
words
for
reply
you
sit
down
he
said
will
stand
here
but
i
have
more
to
say
to
you
before
i
go
should
you
say
more
emily
urged
you
not
think
how
very
painful
it
is
to
hear
you
speak
in
this
way
what
purpose
can
it
serve
to
speak
to
me
when
i
may
not
listen
must
listen
i
ca
be
sent
away
as
you
would
another
man
no
other
on
earth
can
love
you
as
i
do
no
one
no
one
would
do
for
you
all
that
i
would
do
my
love
gives
me
a
claim
upon
you
it
is
you
that
have
brought
me
to
this
state
a
woman
owes
a
man
something
who
is
driven
mad
by
her
i
have
a
right
to
be
here
and
to
say
all
i
feel
he
was
struggling
with
a
dread
of
the
words
he
had
come
to
utter
a
wild
hope
sprang
in
him
that
he
might
yet
win
her
in
other
ways
he
used
language
recklessly
half
believing
that
his
arguments
would
seem
of
force
his
passion
was
in
the
with
reason
and
humanity
your
regard
for
me
is
so
strong
emily
replied
you
not
shrink
from
causing
me
pain
and
indeed
you
have
no
such
right
as
you
claim
have
i
in
any
way
sought
to
win
your
affection
is
it
manly
to
press
upon
me
a
suit
which
you
know
it
is
out
of
my
power
to
favour
you
say
you
respect
me
your
words
are
not
consistent
with
respect
i
owe
you
nothing
dagworthy
and
it
is
certainly
my
right
to
demand
that
you
will
cease
to
distress
and
trouble
me
he
stood
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
is
all
you
have
to
say
he
asked
almost
sullenly
more
can
i
say
surely
you
should
not
have
compelled
me
to
say
even
so
much
i
appeal
to
your
kindness
to
your
sense
of
what
is
due
from
a
man
to
a
woman
to
let
me
leave
you
now
and
to
make
no
further
attempt
to
see
me
if
you
refuse
you
take
advantage
of
my
powerlessness
i
am
sure
you
are
not
capable
of
that
i
am
capable
of
more
than
you
think
he
replied
the
words
coming
between
his
teeth
his
evil
demon
not
himself
was
speaking
in
finding
utterance
at
length
it
made
him
deadly
pale
and
brought
a
cold
sweat
to
his
brow
you
think
afterwards
of
what
i
say
now
remember
that
it
was
love
of
you
that
made
me
desperate
a
chance
you
little
dream
of
has
put
power
into
my
hands
and
i
am
going
to
use
it
i
care
for
nothing
on
this
earth
but
to
make
you
my
wife
and
i
can
do
so
terror
weighed
upon
her
heart
his
tone
was
that
of
a
man
who
would
stick
at
nothing
and
his
words
would
bear
no
futile
meaning
her
thoughts
were
at
once
of
her
father
through
him
alone
could
he
have
power
over
her
she
waited
sick
with
agonised
anticipation
for
what
would
follow
father
the
gulf
between
purpose
and
execution
once
passed
he
had
become
cruel
human
nature
has
often
enough
exemplified
the
law
in
prominent
instances
as
he
pronounced
the
words
he
eyed
her
deliberately
and
before
proceeding
paused
just
long
enough
to
see
the
anguish
flutter
in
her
breast
father
has
been
guilty
of
dishonesty
he
has
taken
money
from
the
mill
any
day
that
i
choose
i
can
convict
him
she
half
closed
her
eyes
and
shook
as
if
under
a
blow
then
the
blood
rushed
to
her
face
and
to
his
astonishment
she
uttered
a
strange
laugh
is
your
power
over
me
she
exclaimed
with
all
the
scorn
her
voice
could
express
i
know
that
you
are
indeed
capable
of
shameful
things
you
think
i
shall
believe
that
of
my
father
dagworthy
knew
what
it
was
to
feel
despicable
he
would
in
this
moment
have
relinquished
all
his
hope
to
be
able
to
retract
those
words
he
was
like
a
beaten
dog
before
her
and
the
excess
of
his
degradation
made
him
brutal
it
or
not
as
you
choose
all
i
have
to
say
is
that
your
father
put
into
his
pocket
yesterday
morning
a
note
of
mine
which
he
found
in
a
ledger
he
took
out
of
my
room
he
had
to
go
to
hebsworth
on
business
and
there
he
changed
the
note
to
buy
himself
a
new
hat
i
have
a
witness
of
it
when
he
came
back
hoof
course
had
nothing
to
say
about
the
money
in
fact
he
had
stolen
it
she
heard
and
there
came
into
her
mind
the
story
of
cheeseman
debt
that
was
of
ten
pounds
the
purchase
her
father
had
been
obliged
to
make
of
that
also
she
had
heard
last
night
and
again
this
morning
her
mother
had
incessantly
marvelled
at
this
money
having
been
at
length
returned
it
was
an
incredible
thing
she
had
said
only
the
sight
of
the
coins
could
convince
her
of
its
truth
emily
mind
worked
over
the
details
of
the
previous
evening
with
terrible
rapidity
and
insight
to
her
directly
her
father
had
spoken
not
a
word
of
the
repayment
he
had
bidden
her
keep
in
another
room
while
he
informed
her
mother
of
it
he
had
shown
disinclination
to
return
to
the
subject
when
later
they
all
sat
together
here
it
is
he
had
said
we
talk
no
more
about
it
she
heard
those
words
exactly
as
they
were
spoken
and
she
knew
their
tone
was
not
natural
even
at
the
time
that
had
struck
her
but
her
thought
had
not
dwelt
upon
it
she
almost
forgot
dagworthy
presence
he
and
his
threats
were
of
small
account
in
this
shaking
of
the
depths
of
her
nature
she
was
awakened
by
his
voice
you
think
i
am
lying
to
you
for
my
own
purposes
can
not
say
she
answered
with
unnatural
calm
is
more
likely
than
that
what
you
say
is
true
he
by
now
had
attained
a
which
would
not
desert
him
so
far
in
crime
there
was
no
turning
back
he
could
even
enjoy
the
anticipation
of
each
new
move
in
the
game
certain
of
winning
he
could
be
cruel
now
for
cruelty
sake
it
was
a
form
of
fruition
he
said
is
your
own
concern
whether
you
believe
me
or
not
if
you
wish
for
evidence
you
shall
have
it
the
completest
what
i
have
to
say
is
this
from
now
till
monday
morning
your
father
is
free
whether
i
have
him
arrested
then
or
not
depends
upon
yourself
if
you
consent
to
become
my
wife
as
soon
as
it
is
possible
for
us
to
be
married
neither
you
nor
he
will
ever
hear
another
word
of
the
matter
what
more
i
will
at
once
put
him
in
a
position
of
comfort
if
you
refuse
there
will
be
a
policeman
ready
to
arrest
him
as
soon
as
he
comes
to
the
mill
if
he
tries
to
escape
a
warrant
will
be
issued
in
any
case
he
will
be
ruined
then
after
a
pause
you
have
till
night
to
make
up
your
mind
you
can
either
send
me
a
note
or
come
and
see
me
i
shall
be
at
home
whenever
you
come
emily
stood
in
silence
hope
you
quite
understand
what
i
mean
dagworthy
continued
as
if
discussing
an
ordinary
matter
of
business
one
will
ever
dream
that
your
father
has
done
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
after
all
it
is
not
so
impossible
that
you
should
marry
me
for
my
own
sake
he
said
it
with
bitterness
will
see
nothing
to
wonder
at
fortunately
no
one
knows
of
that
of
what
you
told
me
your
father
and
mother
will
be
easy
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
and
without
a
suspicion
that
there
has
been
anything
but
what
appears
on
the
surface
i
need
say
how
things
are
likely
to
look
in
the
other
event
still
she
stood
silent
do
expect
an
answer
now
emily
shook
her
head
he
continued
must
leave
it
after
night
it
will
be
too
late
she
began
to
move
away
from
him
with
a
step
or
two
he
followed
her
she
turned
with
a
passionate
movement
of
repulsion
terror
and
hate
transfiguring
her
countenance
made
for
the
expression
of
all
sweet
and
tender
and
noble
things
dagworthy
checked
himself
turned
about
and
walked
quickly
from
the
place
chapter
xi
emily
decision
emily
reached
home
a
few
minutes
before
her
mother
came
to
her
from
the
back
of
the
house
where
things
were
in
saturday
tumult
speaking
with
a
voice
of
fretful
satisfaction
just
given
you
up
and
was
wondering
whether
to
let
the
meat
spoil
or
begin
dinner
alone
am
sorry
to
be
late
mother
you
not
late
my
dear
the
mother
admitted
only
that
you
a
little
uncertain
and
when
one
draws
on
i
can
never
be
quite
sure
of
you
if
you
out
i
must
say
i
like
punctuality
though
i
dare
say
it
an
kind
of
thing
which
would
you
like
potatoes
baked
or
boiled
i
got
both
as
i
always
think
the
baked
keep
better
for
your
father
you
have
yourself
mother
child
do
make
a
choice
as
if
you
could
say
which
you
would
prefer
now
you
say
that
because
you
think
there
wo
be
enough
of
the
others
i
know
very
well
yen
always
like
the
baked
when
i
have
them
do
you
now
emily
which
you
like
what
it
matter
my
dear
i
sure
i
only
wanted
to
please
you
said
mrs
hood
in
her
tone
of
patience
under
injury
ca
see
why
you
should
be
angry
with
me
if
i
could
give
you
more
choice
i
would
no
doubt
used
to
having
potatoes
done
in
all
sorts
of
superior
ways
but
unfortunately
i
was
brought
up
as
a
cook
the
strange
look
with
which
emily
was
regarding
her
brought
her
to
a
pause
her
voice
dropped
dear
said
the
girl
in
a
low
and
shaken
tone
am
neither
foolish
nor
unkind
do
try
to
believe
that
something
is
troubling
me
let
your
choice
be
mine
mrs
hood
moved
away
and
served
the
dinner
in
silence
is
your
trouble
my
dear
she
asked
presently
you
tell
me
emily
shook
her
head
her
mother
relapsed
into
thoughtfulness
and
they
finished
their
meal
with
little
conversation
mrs
heed
was
just
rising
from
the
table
when
there
was
a
sound
of
some
one
opening
the
gate
before
the
house
she
looked
to
the
window
and
at
once
uttered
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
if
that
is
he
has
altered
a
bit
all
these
years
is
it
mother
emily
asked
nervously
my
dear
it
that
man
cheeseman
the
very
idea
of
his
coming
here
now
mark
my
words
he
come
to
ask
for
that
money
back
again
or
for
some
of
it
at
all
events
it
was
just
showing
off
pretending
to
pay
it
back
exactly
like
him
but
if
your
father
foolish
enough
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
there
he
knocking
i
hoped
never
to
see
his
face
again
as
long
as
i
lived
how
ever
he
can
have
the
impudence
to
come
i
suppose
i
must
let
him
in
but
i
sure
i
sha
offer
him
any
dinner
emily
had
risen
from
her
chair
and
was
trembling
with
excitement
yes
mother
she
cried
with
a
joy
which
astonished
mrs
heed
must
behave
kindly
to
him
he
paid
father
the
money
we
must
remember
that
you
see
if
i
net
right
but
i
ca
keep
him
standing
at
the
door
do
untie
this
apron
emily
i
so
nervous
i
ca
get
at
the
knot
see
now
if
he
has
come
for
the
money
back
again
mind
he
paid
it
he
paid
it
ca
understand
you
child
what
is
there
to
be
so
pleased
about
do
go
to
the
door
or
shall
i
the
girl
was
overcome
with
a
sudden
light
in
utter
darkness
she
grasped
at
her
mother
explanation
of
the
visitor
arrival
unable
in
her
ardour
to
calculate
probabilities
to
review
details
dagworthy
had
been
guilty
of
a
base
falsehood
the
man
approached
who
could
assure
her
of
it
it
was
a
plot
deeply
planned
in
some
manner
dagworthy
had
learned
what
had
happened
to
her
father
in
hebsworth
and
had
risked
everything
on
the
terror
he
could
inspire
in
her
the
coming
of
her
father
friend
was
salvation
she
found
herself
clasping
his
hand
warmly
miss
hood
cheeseman
came
in
exclaiming
may
perhaps
have
half
a
recollection
of
me
when
you
told
who
i
am
but
i
quite
sure
i
should
have
known
you
your
good
father
was
telling
me
about
you
yesterday
rare
and
proud
he
was
to
speak
of
you
too
and
not
without
reason
i
see
hoed
you
no
need
to
complain
of
your
for
tune
times
have
been
hard
no
doubt
but
they
brought
you
a
blessing
if
i
had
a
young
lady
such
as
this
to
look
at
me
and
call
me
father
well
well
it
wo
do
to
think
of
it
in
spite
of
her
determination
hoed
was
mollified
into
an
offer
of
dinner
cheeseman
affected
to
refuse
but
at
a
word
from
emily
he
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
the
two
sat
with
him
and
listened
to
his
talk
of
bygone
days
emily
face
was
flushed
she
kept
her
eyes
on
cheeseman
as
if
his
arrival
were
that
of
a
friend
the
visitor
abounded
in
compliments
to
mother
and
daughter
alike
he
ate
the
while
with
extreme
heartiness
and
at
length
drew
from
the
table
in
the
most
effusive
mood
hood
he
said
leaning
forward
owe
you
an
apology
many
apologies
you
and
your
good
husband
in
times
long
past
did
me
a
service
of
a
very
substantial
kind
you
thought
i
had
forgotten
it
yes
you
could
help
but
think
it
we
wo
talk
about
that
cheeseman
interposed
mrs
hood
not
without
a
suggestion
in
her
tone
that
she
had
indeed
entertained
the
thought
attributed
to
her
but
i
ca
help
speaking
of
it
said
cheeseman
feelingly
hood
you
probably
do
know
what
i
refer
to
you
were
a
very
little
lady
in
those
days
they
were
hard
times
with
me
indeed
i
never
known
anything
else
i
was
saying
to
your
good
father
yesterday
that
he
could
no
longer
talk
of
his
many
a
day
he
and
i
have
encouraged
each
other
to
face
fortune
but
that
all
over
for
him
got
his
foot
on
firm
ground
thank
heaven
i
still
catching
at
straws
you
see
i
dare
say
it
a
good
deal
my
own
fault
and
then
i
never
had
a
good
wife
to
look
after
me
and
a
daughter
growing
up
to
teach
me
prudence
well
but
miss
hood
i
was
saying
that
your
father
did
me
a
great
service
he
lent
me
what
was
a
large
sum
for
him
in
those
days
a
little
one
even
in
these
cheeseman
remarked
mrs
hood
well
but
in
those
times
it
was
a
thing
few
men
in
his
position
would
have
done
he
lent
me
a
note
miss
hood
and
it
right
you
should
know
it
years
have
gone
by
years
and
any
one
would
think
i
kept
out
of
the
way
to
avoid
paying
the
money
back
i
assure
you
mrs
hood
and
to
you
miss
hood
i
give
my
solemn
word
of
honour
that
i
never
from
that
day
to
this
had
more
money
than
would
just
keep
me
in
bread
and
cheese
and
such
poor
clothing
as
this
you
see
on
me
why
even
yesterday
as
no
doubt
your
good
father
has
told
you
i
had
but
a
in
the
world
but
one
coin
of
sixpence
ah
you
may
well
look
sad
my
good
young
lady
please
god
you
never
know
what
that
means
but
one
sixpence
had
i
and
but
for
my
old
friend
i
should
have
been
hard
driven
to
find
a
place
of
rest
last
night
now
do
i
look
and
speak
like
an
ungrateful
man
mrs
hood
i
come
here
this
day
because
i
felt
in
duty
bound
to
call
on
you
being
so
near
i
did
know
your
address
till
that
meeting
by
chance
yesterday
when
my
old
friend
left
me
i
got
restless
i
felt
i
must
see
you
all
again
before
i
went
south
as
i
hope
to
do
perhaps
i
felt
i
must
clear
myself
from
the
charge
of
in
gratitude
i
could
live
easy
under
it
it
was
too
much
like
a
piece
of
dishonesty
and
that
i
never
yet
been
guilty
of
for
all
i
gone
through
and
please
god
never
shall
my
old
friend
hood
and
i
in
days
even
before
he
had
the
happiness
to
meet
you
mrs
hood
we
used
to
say
to
each
other
let
luck
do
its
worst
we
live
and
die
honest
men
and
thank
heaven
we
kept
our
word
for
an
honester
man
than
james
hood
does
walk
the
earth
and
no
one
ever
yet
brought
a
true
charge
of
dishonesty
against
alfred
cheeseman
he
looked
from
mother
to
daughter
the
former
sat
in
helpless
astonishment
gazing
about
her
emily
had
hardened
her
face
find
it
a
sad
tale
cheeseman
proceeded
so
it
is
dear
ladies
if
ever
i
had
owned
a
note
over
and
above
the
price
of
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
night
lodging
it
should
have
been
put
aside
with
the
name
of
james
hood
written
on
the
back
of
it
and
somehow
have
found
him
out
and
i
say
the
same
thing
now
do
think
mrs
hood
that
i
pleading
my
poverty
as
a
way
of
asking
you
to
forgive
the
debt
the
debt
shall
be
paid
be
assured
of
that
if
i
can
only
get
to
london
there
a
prospect
before
me
i
have
a
project
which
i
explained
to
my
old
friend
yesterday
you
shall
have
the
money
and
what
more
you
shall
have
interest
four
per
cent
per
annum
oh
yes
you
shall
only
let
me
somehow
get
to
london
the
gate
sounded
again
exclaimed
mrs
hood
your
father
she
was
pale
and
the
hand
with
which
she
pointed
could
not
steady
itself
said
the
girl
just
above
her
breath
he
is
coming
in
mrs
hood
rose
and
left
the
room
cheeseman
could
not
but
observe
that
some
strange
agitation
possessed
them
both
possibly
he
explained
it
by
the
light
of
his
own
conscience
he
sat
smiling
at
emily
rather
uneasily
then
seeing
that
there
was
likely
to
be
a
delay
before
hood
entered
he
bent
forward
to
speak
confidentially
hood
i
see
it
in
your
face
you
as
kind
and
as
your
father
is
and
that
saying
much
you
wo
think
hardly
of
a
poor
fellow
who
oftener
misses
a
dinner
than
gets
one
every
word
i
said
to
you
as
true
as
the
light
of
heaven
and
my
only
chance
is
to
get
to
london
i
made
an
invention
and
i
feel
sure
i
know
a
man
who
will
buy
it
of
me
it
took
my
last
farthing
to
get
here
from
hebsworth
you
do
think
hardly
of
me
i
do
drink
on
my
word
i
do
it
sheer
hard
luck
ah
if
i
had
a
home
like
this
it
be
like
living
in
the
garden
of
eden
well
well
the
door
opened
and
hood
came
in
followed
by
his
wife
he
was
laughing
laughing
loudly
the
voice
was
so
unlike
his
that
this
alone
would
have
caused
emily
to
gaze
at
him
in
astonishment
you
looked
us
up
he
exclaimed
holding
out
his
hand
you
could
have
done
better
i
was
sorry
afterwards
i
had
asked
you
my
wife
tells
me
you
had
dinner
you
wo
mind
sitting
by
whilst
i
eat
and
what
do
you
think
of
emily
eh
grown
a
little
since
you
saw
her
last
ha
ha
so
you
made
up
your
mind
to
go
to
london
emily
had
dinner
why
of
course
you
have
i
was
forgetting
baked
potatoes
remember
my
old
weakness
for
them
baked
cheeseman
we
used
to
buy
in
the
street
at
night
halfpenny
apiece
eh
old
man
with
one
arm
remember
we
used
to
hear
him
coming
when
he
was
half
a
mile
off
what
a
voice
and
the
man
who
sold
peas
remember
him
all
all
we
were
lads
then
eh
cheeseman
emily
just
a
mouthful
with
butter
let
me
tempt
you
no
what
train
did
you
come
by
he
talked
ceaselessly
there
was
a
spot
of
red
in
the
midst
of
each
of
his
sallow
cheeks
and
his
eyes
gleamed
with
excitement
on
leaving
the
mill
a
sudden
thirst
had
come
upon
him
and
he
had
quenched
it
with
a
glass
of
spirits
at
the
first
he
passed
perhaps
that
had
some
part
in
his
elation
emily
almost
immediately
withdrew
and
went
up
to
her
bedroom
here
she
sat
alone
for
more
than
an
hour
in
fear
lest
her
mother
should
come
to
the
door
then
she
heard
the
gate
open
and
looking
from
the
window
saw
her
father
and
his
friend
pass
into
the
road
and
walk
away
together
the
former
still
talking
in
an
excited
way
a
minute
or
two
later
came
the
knock
which
she
dreaded
she
opened
the
door
and
her
mother
entered
did
you
ever
know
your
father
so
strange
mrs
hood
asked
in
a
tone
of
genuine
alarm
she
had
sunk
upon
a
chair
and
looked
to
the
girl
as
if
overcome
with
physical
weakness
can
it
all
mean
when
i
asked
him
why
he
had
told
that
story
about
the
money
he
only
laughed
said
it
was
a
joke
and
he
explain
it
all
before
long
i
ca
think
where
the
money
came
from
and
now
he
gone
to
pay
that
man
fare
to
london
and
no
doubt
to
lend
him
more
money
too
emily
made
no
reply
she
stood
near
the
window
and
looked
out
at
the
clouds
which
were
breaking
after
a
brief
shower
the
money
may
have
come
from
pursued
her
mother
cruel
that
it
should
go
in
this
way
we
never
wanted
it
worse
than
we
do
now
it
my
belief
he
borrowed
it
himself
a
nice
thing
to
borrow
for
one
own
needs
and
then
throw
it
away
on
such
a
as
that
emily
turned
and
put
a
question
quietly
you
in
more
than
usual
need
of
money
my
dear
you
know
i
always
try
to
say
as
little
about
such
things
as
i
can
but
now
your
father
been
and
borrowed
as
of
course
he
must
have
done
there
no
choice
but
to
tell
you
the
house
at
going
to
be
empty
at
the
end
of
the
quarter
and
our
rent
here
going
to
be
raised
and
all
things
coming
together
we
had
a
good
deal
to
make
us
anxious
it
just
like
your
father
wanting
to
make
me
believe
that
things
are
better
than
they
really
are
it
always
was
his
way
and
what
the
good
of
it
i
never
could
see
of
course
he
means
it
well
but
he
far
better
have
been
open
about
it
and
have
told
me
what
he
was
going
to
do
emily
was
shaken
with
agitation
she
exclaimed
have
you
both
insisted
on
keeping
silence
before
me
about
your
difficulties
there
was
no
kindness
in
it
you
have
done
me
the
cruelest
wrong
had
i
not
money
in
plenty
beyond
what
i
needed
what
if
the
future
be
uncertain
has
not
the
present
its
claims
and
can
your
needs
be
separated
from
mine
because
you
have
succeeded
in
keeping
me
apart
from
the
troubles
of
your
life
you
you
and
father
have
thought
you
had
done
a
praiseworthy
thing
is
it
not
bad
enough
that
one
human
being
should
be
indifferent
to
the
wants
of
another
just
because
they
call
each
other
strangers
was
it
right
to
bring
such
a
hateful
spirit
of
independence
into
a
home
between
parents
and
child
if
the
world
is
base
and
unjust
is
not
that
a
reason
the
more
why
we
should
draw
ever
more
closely
to
each
other
and
be
to
each
other
all
that
our
power
allows
independent
because
i
earned
money
and
could
support
myself
you
have
told
me
i
must
be
independent
and
leave
you
the
same
that
is
the
lesson
that
life
has
taught
you
it
is
well
to
have
understanding
for
lessons
of
a
deeper
kind
my
child
protested
the
mother
to
whom
the
general
tenor
of
such
reasoning
was
as
dark
as
its
special
application
have
always
felt
we
were
doing
our
duty
to
you
at
your
age
it
is
only
right
you
should
have
your
money
for
yourself
who
knows
when
you
may
want
it
i
do
think
you
should
be
angry
with
us
just
because
felt
we
rather
put
up
with
a
little
hardship
now
and
then
than
have
you
feel
some
day
we
been
a
burden
on
you
i
have
complained
and
i
not
complaining
now
i
sorry
i
came
to
speak
to
you
about
such
a
thing
it
seems
as
if
you
could
never
take
a
thing
as
i
mean
it
like
the
potatoes
at
dinner
i
meant
to
do
you
a
kindness
by
giving
you
the
choice
and
you
flew
out
as
if
you
had
patience
with
me
emily
kept
her
eyes
upon
the
window
you
can
say
went
on
mrs
hood
we
been
cruel
to
you
and
done
you
a
wrong
i
know
we
very
different
ways
of
looking
at
most
things
but
where
we
wronged
you
is
more
than
i
can
understand
have
taken
from
me
replied
emily
without
moving
her
eyes
power
to
help
you
i
might
have
done
much
now
i
can
do
nothing
and
your
loss
is
mine
indeed
it
is
and
sha
be
emily
your
father
and
i
have
always
said
that
one
thing
that
you
should
suffer
by
us
what
did
your
father
always
say
years
ago
emily
he
said
shall
have
a
good
education
however
we
stint
ourselves
then
when
she
grows
up
always
be
able
to
keep
herself
from
want
and
our
poverty
wo
matter
to
her
and
in
that
at
all
events
he
was
right
and
it
come
about
as
he
said
no
emily
we
not
going
to
be
a
burden
to
you
so
fear
it
will
you
let
me
be
by
myself
a
little
i
will
come
down
to
you
presently
you
well
my
dear
the
mother
asked
with
a
mixture
of
offended
reserve
and
anxiety
occasioned
by
the
girl
voice
and
aspect
have
a
headache
i
will
rest
till
mrs
hood
had
for
a
long
time
been
unused
to
tend
emily
with
motherly
offices
like
her
husband
she
was
not
seldom
impressed
with
awe
of
this
nature
so
apart
from
her
own
that
feeling
possessed
her
now
before
emily
last
words
she
moved
away
in
silence
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
gently
the
irony
of
fate
coming
out
so
bitterly
in
all
that
her
mother
had
said
was
like
a
cold
hand
on
emily
heart
she
sat
again
in
the
chair
from
which
she
had
risen
and
let
her
head
lie
back
her
vitality
was
at
a
low
ebb
the
movement
of
indignation
against
the
cruelty
which
was
wrecking
her
life
had
passed
and
left
behind
it
a
weary
indifference
happily
she
need
not
think
yet
there
were
still
some
hours
of
respite
before
her
there
was
the
night
to
give
her
strength
the
daylight
was
a
burden
it
must
be
borne
with
what
patience
she
could
summon
but
she
longed
for
the
time
of
sacred
silence
to
a
spirit
capable
of
high
exaltations
the
hour
of
lassitude
is
a
foretaste
of
the
impotence
of
death
to
see
a
purpose
in
the
cold
light
of
intellectual
conviction
and
to
lack
the
inspiring
fervour
which
can
glorify
a
struggle
with
the
obstacles
nature
will
interpose
is
to
realise
intensely
the
rugged
baldness
of
life
stripped
of
illusion
life
as
we
shall
see
it
when
the
end
approaches
and
the
only
voice
that
convinces
tell
us
that
all
is
vanity
it
is
the
mood
known
by
the
artist
when
viewing
the
work
complete
within
his
mind
his
heart
lacks
its
joy
and
his
hand
is
cold
to
execute
makes
of
life
itself
a
work
of
art
there
are
the
blessed
moments
when
ardour
rises
in
pursuit
of
the
ideal
when
it
is
supreme
bliss
to
strive
and
overcome
and
there
are
the
times
of
aching
languor
when
the
conception
is
still
clear
in
every
line
but
the
soul
asks
wearily
to
what
end
in
emily
it
was
reaction
after
the
eagerness
of
her
sudden
unreasoning
hope
body
and
mind
suffered
beneath
a
burden
of
dull
misery
motives
seemed
weak
effort
was
weary
and
unprofitable
life
unutterably
mean
it
could
scarcely
be
called
suffering
to
feel
thus
she
was
roused
by
voices
below
and
immediately
after
her
mother
came
to
her
door
again
it
vexatious
mrs
hood
whispered
are
jessie
and
geraldine
i
obliged
to
ask
them
to
stay
tea
do
you
feel
well
enough
to
come
down
emily
went
down
at
once
almost
with
a
sense
of
relief
and
presented
herself
to
the
girls
very
much
in
her
usual
way
i
know
very
well
you
do
want
us
said
jessie
with
her
sprightly
frankness
should
have
thought
of
coming
if
it
been
that
we
met
mr
hood
just
this
side
of
the
bridge
and
he
forced
us
to
come
on
he
said
it
would
be
very
long
before
he
was
back
himself
but
of
course
we
sha
stay
tea
so
it
no
use
of
course
not
put
in
geraldine
know
mrs
hood
always
far
too
busy
on
a
saturday
afternoon
i
did
want
to
come
i
told
jessie
it
would
be
far
better
to
put
it
off
till
the
same
resumed
her
sister
wanted
to
see
you
very
much
she
got
something
to
tell
you
now
you
may
as
well
get
it
out
and
done
with
jerry
you
need
expect
i
going
to
help
you
the
two
giggled
together
is
it
inquired
mrs
hood
daresay
i
could
guess
if
i
tried
very
hard
could
you
emily
then
jerry
for
the
awful
news
urged
her
sister
have
to
tell
jessie
said
the
other
giggling
and
blushing
i
suppose
one
of
us
must
she
been
and
engaged
herself
to
baldwin
of
course
we
all
knew
jessie
you
knew
nothing
of
the
kind
i
though
ought
she
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
at
her
age
mrs
hood
i
know
what
emily
opinion
is
she
simply
disgusted
look
at
her
and
see
if
she
is
the
gabble
of
the
two
girls
was
worthy
of
the
occasion
their
tongues
went
like
whilst
her
mother
busied
herself
in
preparing
tea
emily
sat
and
listened
fortunately
there
was
little
need
for
her
to
talk
to
herself
she
seemed
to
be
suffering
a
kind
of
trance
without
detriment
to
her
consciousness
the
chattering
and
grimacing
girls
appeared
before
her
as
grotesque
unrealities
puppets
animated
in
some
marvellous
way
and
set
to
caricature
humanity
she
tried
to
realise
that
one
of
them
was
a
woman
like
herself
who
had
just
consented
to
be
a
man
wife
but
it
was
impossible
to
her
to
regard
this
as
anything
but
an
aping
of
things
which
at
other
times
had
a
solemn
meaning
she
found
herself
gazing
at
geraldine
as
one
does
at
some
singular
piece
of
mechanism
with
a
frivolous
purpose
and
it
was
not
only
the
individuals
that
impressed
her
thus
these
two
represented
life
and
the
world
she
had
strange
cynical
thoughts
imaginings
which
revolted
her
pure
mind
even
whilst
it
entertained
them
no
endeavour
would
shake
off
this
ghastly
clairvoyance
she
was
picturing
the
scene
of
acceptance
of
the
offer
of
marriage
then
her
thoughts
passed
on
to
the
early
days
of
wedded
life
she
rose
shuddering
and
moved
about
the
room
she
talked
to
drive
those
images
from
her
brain
it
did
but
transfer
the
sense
of
unreality
to
her
own
being
where
was
she
and
what
doing
had
she
not
dreamed
that
a
hideous
choice
had
been
set
before
her
a
choice
from
which
there
was
no
escape
and
which
whatever
the
alternative
she
accepted
would
blast
her
life
but
that
was
something
grave
earnest
and
what
place
was
there
for
either
earnestness
or
gravity
in
a
world
where
geraldine
represented
womanhood
wooed
and
about
to
be
wedded
there
was
but
one
way
of
stopping
the
gabble
which
was
driving
her
frantic
she
threw
open
the
piano
and
began
to
play
to
play
the
first
music
that
came
into
her
mind
it
was
a
passage
from
the
moonlight
sonata
a
few
moments
and
the
ghosts
were
laid
the
girls
still
whispered
together
but
above
their
voices
the
pure
stream
of
music
flowed
with
gracious
oblivion
when
emily
ceased
it
was
with
an
inward
fervour
of
gratitude
to
the
master
and
the
instrument
to
know
that
was
to
have
caught
once
more
the
point
of
view
from
which
life
had
meaning
now
let
them
chatter
and
mop
and
mow
the
echo
of
that
music
still
lived
around
hood
had
not
returned
when
they
sat
down
to
tea
jessie
began
to
ask
questions
about
the
man
they
had
met
in
company
with
him
but
mrs
hood
turned
the
conversation
suppose
you
be
coming
with
the
same
tale
next
jessie
she
said
with
reference
to
geraldine
mrs
hood
no
indeed
i
have
had
lessons
from
emily
for
nothing
it
all
very
well
for
chits
like
jerry
here
but
i
got
serious
things
to
attend
to
i
like
emily
she
and
i
are
never
going
to
be
married
never
going
to
be
married
exclaimed
mrs
hood
half
seriously
you
must
believe
all
emily
tells
you
she
has
told
me
that
herself
but
i
quite
sure
she
would
be
offended
if
any
one
thought
her
capable
of
such
frivolity
will
keep
it
to
herself
till
the
said
geraldine
with
a
mocking
shake
of
the
bead
is
one
to
go
telling
her
secrets
at
this
point
hood
made
his
appearance
his
wife
paid
no
heed
to
him
as
he
entered
emily
glanced
at
him
furtively
he
had
the
look
of
a
man
who
has
predetermined
an
attitude
of
easy
nor
had
the
parting
with
cheeseman
failed
to
prove
an
occasion
for
fresh
recourse
to
that
fiery
adjuvant
which
of
a
sudden
was
become
indispensable
to
him
want
of
taste
for
liquor
and
lifelong
habit
of
abstemiousness
had
hitherto
kept
hood
the
soberest
of
men
he
could
not
remember
to
have
felt
the
warm
solace
of
a
draught
taken
for
solace
sake
since
the
days
when
cheeseman
had
been
wont
to
insist
upon
the
glass
of
gin
at
their
meetings
and
then
it
had
never
gone
beyond
the
single
glass
for
he
felt
that
his
head
was
weak
and
dreaded
temptation
hours
had
wrought
such
a
change
in
him
that
already
to
enter
a
seemed
a
familiar
act
and
he
calculated
upon
the
courage
to
be
begotten
of
a
smoking
tumbler
previously
the
mere
outlay
would
have
made
him
miserable
but
the
command
of
unearned
coin
was
affecting
him
as
it
is
wont
to
affect
poor
men
the
new
aid
given
to
cheeseman
left
a
few
shillings
out
of
the
second
broken
sovereign
let
the
two
pounds
he
said
to
himself
be
regarded
as
gone
eight
remained
untouched
for
the
odd
shillings
let
them
serve
odd
expenses
so
when
he
had
purchased
cheeseman
ticket
to
king
gross
he
was
free
with
small
change
at
the
station
bar
at
the
last
moment
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
save
himself
a
walk
by
going
in
the
train
as
far
as
pendal
so
it
was
here
that
the
final
parting
had
taken
place
he
seated
himself
with
his
legs
across
a
chair
and
began
to
talk
to
geraldine
of
the
interesting
news
which
jessie
had
just
whispered
to
him
when
they
met
on
the
road
the
character
of
his
remarks
was
not
quite
what
it
would
have
been
a
day
or
two
ago
he
joked
with
more
freedom
than
was
his
custom
studiously
he
avoided
the
eyes
of
his
wife
and
daughter
he
declined
to
sit
up
to
the
table
but
drank
a
cup
of
tea
with
his
hands
resting
on
the
back
of
a
chair
the
cartwright
sisters
were
anxious
to
use
the
evening
for
a
visit
to
certain
other
friends
shortly
after
six
they
took
their
departure
while
emily
and
mrs
hood
were
seeing
them
away
at
the
door
hood
went
upstairs
to
his
laboratory
come
here
mrs
hood
said
with
anxious
earnestness
leading
the
way
back
into
the
and
when
the
door
was
closed
dear
what
the
matter
with
him
do
you
notice
his
strangeness
mother
i
do
he
have
it
a
thing
he
never
does
you
know
what
i
mean
that
cheeseman
has
been
taking
him
to
a
i
am
sure
of
it
emily
had
had
no
such
thought
to
her
a
squalid
horror
clung
about
the
suggestion
to
picture
her
father
in
such
circumstances
was
to
realise
a
fresh
fall
into
degradation
no
doubt
the
inevitable
consequence
of
that
she
already
knew
of
there
was
a
painful
stricture
at
her
heart
a
cry
of
despair
all
but
found
utterance
her
father
voice
was
calling
from
the
she
darted
to
the
door
in
momentary
terror
and
replied
you
come
up
hood
said
want
you
she
ascended
to
the
garret
hood
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
little
window
so
that
his
face
was
shadowed
emily
moved
to
the
table
and
with
her
hands
resting
upon
it
her
eyes
bent
stood
waiting
he
began
still
with
a
remnant
of
artificial
pleasantry
though
his
voice
was
not
entirely
under
control
want
to
explain
that
to
you
it
does
look
well
i
am
a
good
deal
ashamed
of
myself
if
i
was
a
boy
i
should
deserve
a
whipping
for
telling
a
fib
should
i
it
was
impossible
to
make
reply
to
such
words
truth
is
this
he
went
on
more
nervously
been
in
a
little
difficulty
your
mother
and
i
that
we
did
see
any
good
in
troubling
you
about
in
fact
there
a
raising
of
rent
and
one
or
two
other
little
things
when
i
was
in
hebsworth
yesterday
i
had
an
opportunity
of
borrowing
ten
pounds
and
i
thought
it
better
to
do
so
then
i
met
cheeseman
and
it
was
his
mention
of
the
debt
put
into
my
head
the
stupid
thought
of
trying
to
spare
your
mother
anxiety
of
course
such
tricks
never
succeed
i
might
have
known
it
but
there
that
the
truth
of
the
matter
and
i
easier
now
now
i
told
it
her
heart
bled
for
him
so
dreadful
to
her
ears
was
the
choking
of
his
voice
upon
the
last
words
at
the
same
time
she
was
hot
with
anguish
of
shame
he
stood
before
her
a
wretched
culprit
hiding
his
guilt
with
lie
upon
lie
he
her
father
whom
she
had
reverenced
so
had
compassionated
so
whom
she
loved
despairingly
she
could
not
raise
her
head
she
could
not
speak
she
longed
to
spring
to
him
and
hold
him
in
her
arms
but
other
thoughts
paralysed
the
impulse
had
there
lain
nothing
in
the
background
had
his
falsehood
his
weakness
been
all
she
could
have
comforted
and
strengthened
him
with
pure
pity
and
love
but
the
consciousness
of
what
was
before
her
killed
her
power
to
stead
him
in
his
misery
she
could
not
speak
out
her
very
thought
and
to
palter
with
solemn
words
was
impossible
hypocrisy
from
her
to
him
at
this
moment
hypocrisy
however
coloured
with
sincere
feeling
would
have
sunk
her
in
her
own
eyes
beyond
redemption
us
speak
no
more
of
it
father
she
replied
without
raising
her
head
he
was
sober
enough
now
and
in
her
voice
her
attitude
he
read
his
hopeless
condemnation
between
him
and
this
woman
had
conic
that
which
would
never
be
removed
before
her
he
was
shamed
to
eternity
never
again
could
he
speak
with
her
of
truth
of
justice
of
noble
aims
the
words
would
mock
him
never
again
could
he
take
her
kiss
upon
his
lips
without
shrinking
her
way
henceforth
lay
ever
further
from
his
own
what
part
had
she
in
a
life
become
so
base
what
place
had
she
under
a
roof
dishonoured
if
some
day
she
wedded
his
existence
would
be
to
her
a
secret
shame
for
worst
thought
of
all
it
was
whispered
to
his
conscience
that
she
did
not
credit
even
what
he
now
told
her
he
seemed
to
himself
to
have
betrayed
the
second
untruth
by
his
way
of
speaking
it
in
the
silence
which
followed
upon
her
words
he
heard
promptings
of
despair
how
could
he
live
in
her
presence
from
day
to
day
not
daring
to
meet
her
eyes
he
looked
back
upon
the
years
behind
him
and
they
seemed
to
overflow
with
peaceful
happiness
irretrievable
his
yielding
and
his
shame
irrecoverable
the
conscious
rectitude
bartered
so
cheaply
he
saw
now
that
his
life
had
held
vast
blessings
and
they
were
for
ever
lost
emily
was
speaking
you
wish
to
stay
here
this
evening
father
he
answered
hastily
only
called
you
up
for
for
that
her
heart
reproached
her
with
cruelty
but
what
remained
save
to
leave
him
to
himself
they
could
not
face
each
other
could
not
exchange
a
natural
word
she
turned
at
the
door
he
had
called
her
but
did
not
continue
to
speak
father
only
for
you
you
sit
with
me
again
as
usual
i
hope
so
a
rush
of
tears
had
its
way
as
she
closed
the
door
something
so
deeply
pathetic
had
there
been
in
that
appeal
it
was
the
first
time
that
her
misery
had
found
this
outlet
unable
to
calm
herself
at
once
she
turned
aside
into
her
bedroom
tears
did
not
come
to
her
readily
indeed
it
was
years
since
she
had
shed
them
the
fit
shook
her
with
physical
suffering
the
weeping
would
not
stay
itself
and
to
force
her
sobs
into
silence
was
almost
beyond
her
power
she
flung
herself
desperately
by
the
bedside
throwing
out
her
arms
in
the
effort
to
free
her
chest
from
its
anguishing
constraint
in
an
hour
she
went
down
her
mother
was
sitting
miserably
in
the
kitchen
and
emily
dreading
to
have
to
talk
again
kept
apart
in
the
parlour
when
it
began
to
dusk
hood
descended
and
supper
was
prepared
for
in
the
usual
way
there
was
small
pretence
of
conversation
and
as
soon
as
possible
emily
bade
her
parents
it
was
long
before
she
heard
them
go
to
their
room
they
whispered
together
in
passing
her
door
and
now
the
solemn
hours
shed
about
her
guardian
silence
and
she
could
listen
to
the
voice
of
her
soul
it
was
incredible
that
the
morning
of
the
day
which
was
not
yet
dead
had
witnessed
that
scene
between
her
and
dagworthy
on
the
castle
hill
long
spaces
of
featureless
misery
seem
to
stretch
between
perforce
she
had
overborne
reflection
one
torment
coming
upon
another
had
occupied
her
with
mere
endurance
it
was
as
though
a
ruthless
hand
tore
from
her
shred
after
shred
of
the
fair
garment
in
which
she
had
joyed
to
clothe
herself
while
a
voice
mockingly
bade
her
be
in
congruence
with
the
sordid
shows
of
the
world
around
for
a
moment
whilst
beethoven
sang
to
her
she
knew
the
light
of
faith
but
the
dull
mist
crept
up
again
and
thickened
weeping
had
not
eased
her
bosom
she
had
only
become
more
conscious
of
the
load
of
tears
surcharging
it
now
she
lay
upon
her
bed
in
the
darkness
hushing
idle
echoes
of
day
waiting
upon
the
spirit
that
ever
yet
had
comforted
and
guided
her
what
divested
of
all
horror
due
to
imagination
was
the
threat
to
which
her
life
lay
subject
dagworthy
had
it
in
his
power
to
ruin
her
father
to
blast
his
remaining
years
with
a
desolation
to
which
the
struggle
with
poverty
would
be
the
mere
pleasantry
of
fate
she
could
no
longer
entertain
a
doubt
of
the
guilt
the
first
suggestion
of
which
excited
her
scornful
laughter
and
she
knew
it
to
be
more
than
probable
that
her
father
had
yielded
to
temptation
purposely
put
in
his
way
she
was
not
unconscious
of
the
power
of
reprisal
which
so
gross
a
plot
put
into
her
hands
though
it
was
true
that
the
secrecy
dagworthy
had
maintained
in
his
intercourse
with
her
left
but
her
bare
assertion
for
evidence
against
him
yet
the
thought
was
profitless
suppose
he
did
not
venture
to
prosecute
on
the
charge
of
theft
none
the
less
could
he
work
the
ruin
he
menaced
mere
dismissal
from
his
employment
with
mention
of
the
cause
to
this
and
the
other
person
was
all
that
was
needed
to
render
the
wretched
clerk
an
outcast
hopeless
of
future
means
of
livelihood
for
ever
disgraced
in
the
eyes
of
all
who
knew
him
she
felt
the
cruelty
of
which
this
man
whose
passions
she
had
so
frenzied
was
readily
capable
she
believed
he
would
not
spare
her
an
item
of
suffering
which
it
was
in
his
power
to
inflict
she
knew
that
appeal
to
him
was
worse
than
useless
for
it
was
only
too
clear
that
for
her
to
approach
him
was
to
inflame
his
resolution
her
instinctive
fear
of
him
was
terribly
justified
with
her
alone
then
it
lay
to
save
her
parents
from
the
most
dreadful
fate
that
could
befal
them
from
infamy
from
destitution
from
despair
for
even
if
her
father
escaped
imprisonment
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
live
on
in
dunfield
and
how
at
his
age
was
a
new
life
to
be
begun
and
it
was
idle
to
expect
that
the
last
degradation
would
be
spared
him
his
disgrace
would
involve
her
dagworthy
jealousy
would
not
neglect
such
a
means
of
striking
at
her
engagement
and
wilfrid
must
needs
know
to
emily
not
even
the
possibility
of
hiding
such
a
thing
from
him
suggested
itself
could
she
become
his
wife
with
that
stigma
upon
her
bringing
as
dowry
her
beggared
parents
for
him
to
support
did
it
mean
that
was
this
the
thought
that
she
had
dreaded
to
face
throughout
the
day
was
it
not
only
her
father
whose
ruin
was
involved
and
must
she
too
bid
farewell
to
hope
she
let
those
ghastly
eyes
stare
from
the
darkness
into
her
own
and
tried
to
exhaust
their
horror
it
overtaxed
her
courage
with
a
smothered
cry
of
fear
she
sprang
upright
and
her
shaking
hands
struck
a
flame
to
bring
light
into
the
room
not
once
but
again
and
again
did
the
chill
of
terror
pass
through
her
whole
frame
she
caught
a
passing
glimpse
of
her
image
in
the
glass
and
was
fascinated
into
regarding
it
closely
who
stand
there
in
the
pitiless
night
thus
did
thought
speak
within
her
poor
human
thing
with
the
face
and
eyes
staring
in
all
but
distraction
is
this
the
very
end
of
the
rapturous
dream
which
has
lulled
you
whilst
destiny
wrought
your
woe
is
it
even
now
too
late
to
struggle
is
this
the
wild
sorrow
of
farewell
to
love
the
beginning
of
an
anguish
which
shall
torture
your
soul
to
death
have
you
lost
for
moments
it
was
as
though
life
fought
with
the
last
and
invincible
enemy
on
the
spot
where
she
had
been
standing
she
sank
powerless
to
her
knees
clinging
to
the
nearest
object
her
head
falling
back
the
clock
outside
her
door
struck
one
how
long
the
dull
vibration
seemed
to
endure
she
was
conscious
of
it
though
lying
with
all
but
palsied
faculties
it
was
the
first
of
the
divisions
which
marked
her
long
vigil
the
hours
succeeded
each
other
quickly
between
voice
and
voice
there
seemed
to
pass
but
a
single
wave
of
surging
thought
but
each
new
warning
of
coming
day
found
her
nearer
the
calm
of
resolve
look
at
this
girl
and
try
to
know
her
emily
knew
but
one
article
of
religion
and
that
bade
her
preserve
if
need
be
at
the
cost
of
life
the
purity
of
her
soul
this
was
the
supreme
law
of
her
being
the
pieties
of
kindred
were
as
strong
in
her
as
in
any
heart
that
ever
beat
but
respect
for
them
could
not
constrain
her
to
a
course
which
opposed
that
higher
injunction
growing
with
her
growth
nourished
by
the
substance
which
developed
her
intellectual
force
a
sense
of
all
that
was
involved
in
her
womanhood
had
conic
to
be
the
guiding
principle
of
her
existence
imagine
the
great
artist
nature
bent
upon
the
creation
of
a
soul
which
should
hold
in
subtlest
perfection
of
consciousness
every
element
essential
to
the
successive
ideals
of
maiden
wife
mother
and
the
soul
of
this
girl
is
pictured
her
religion
of
beauty
was
the
symbolic
expression
of
instincts
wholly
chaste
her
body
was
to
her
a
temple
which
preserved
a
sacred
flame
and
she
could
not
conceive
existence
if
once
the
shrine
had
suffered
desecration
we
are
apt
to
attribute
to
women
indiscriminately
at
least
the
outlines
of
this
consciousness
for
the
vast
majority
it
confuses
itself
with
the
prescriptions
of
a
traditional
dogma
if
not
with
the
mere
prejudice
of
social
usage
for
emily
no
external
dogma
existed
and
the
tenor
of
her
life
had
aided
her
in
attaining
independence
of
ignoble
dictation
her
views
were
often
strangely
at
variance
with
those
of
the
social
tribunal
which
sits
in
judgment
on
virtue
and
vice
to
her
for
instance
the
woman
who
sells
herself
with
ecclesiastical
sanction
differed
only
in
degree
of
impurity
from
her
whose
track
is
under
the
she
was
not
censorious
she
was
not
she
spoke
to
no
one
of
the
convictions
that
ruled
her
and
to
herself
held
them
a
mystery
of
holiness
a
revelation
of
high
things
vouchsafed
she
knew
not
whence
nor
how
suppose
her
to
have
been
at
this
juncture
of
her
fate
think
you
she
would
have
found
it
a
whit
less
impossible
to
save
her
father
by
becoming
dagworthy
wife
there
was
in
her
thought
but
one
parallel
to
this
dire
choice
which
lay
before
her
it
was
the
means
offered
to
isabel
of
rescuing
her
brother
claudio
that
passion
of
purity
which
fired
isabel
speech
was
the
breath
of
emily
life
she
knew
well
that
many
and
women
too
would
spare
no
condemnation
of
what
they
would
call
her
heartless
selfishness
she
knew
that
the
paltriest
considerations
of
worldly
estate
are
deemed
sufficient
to
exact
from
a
woman
the
sacrifice
now
demanded
of
her
that
was
no
law
to
emily
the
moral
sense
which
her
own
nature
had
developed
must
here
alone
control
her
purity
as
she
understood
it
the
immaculate
beauty
of
the
soul
was
her
religion
if
other
women
would
die
rather
than
deny
the
object
of
their
worship
to
her
the
ideal
of
chastity
was
worth
no
less
perfect
a
zeal
far
removed
from
the
world
which
theorises
she
presented
in
her
character
a
solution
of
the
difficulties
entertained
by
those
who
doubtingly
seek
a
substitute
for
the
old
religious
sanctions
her
motives
had
the
simplicity
of
elemental
faith
they
were
indeed
but
the
primary
instincts
of
womanhood
exalted
to
a
rare
perfection
and
reflected
in
a
consciousness
of
exceeding
lucidity
the
awakening
of
love
in
such
a
nature
as
this
was
as
it
were
the
admission
to
a
supreme
sacrament
here
was
the
final
sanction
of
the
creed
that
had
grown
from
within
in
the
plighting
of
her
troth
to
wilfrid
athel
emily
had
as
she
herself
saw
it
performed
the
most
solemn
and
sacred
act
of
her
life
instead
of
being
a
mere
preliminary
to
a
holy
observance
which
should
in
truth
unite
them
it
made
that
later
formality
all
but
trivial
it
was
the
aspiration
of
her
devoutest
hours
that
this
interchange
of
loving
promise
might
keep
its
binding
sanctity
for
ever
that
no
touch
of
mutability
might
come
upon
her
heart
till
the
last
coldness
stayed
its
heating
a
second
love
appeared
to
her
to
transfer
to
another
those
thoughts
which
had
wedded
her
soul
to
wilfrid
would
not
merely
be
sin
it
was
an
impossibility
did
he
ever
cease
to
cherish
her
a
thought
at
which
she
smiled
in
her
proud
confidence
that
could
in
nothing
affect
her
love
for
him
which
was
not
otherwise
to
be
expressed
than
as
the
sum
of
her
consciousness
the
pale
light
of
dawn
began
to
glimmer
through
the
emily
gave
it
full
admission
and
looked
out
at
the
morning
sky
faintest
blue
was
growing
between
streaks
of
cold
grey
her
eyes
ached
from
the
fixedness
of
intense
thought
the
sweet
broad
brow
was
marble
the
disorder
of
her
hair
spoke
of
in
anguish
she
had
no
thought
of
seeking
rest
very
far
from
her
was
sleep
and
the
blessedness
of
oblivion
she
felt
as
though
sleep
would
never
come
again
but
she
knew
what
lay
before
her
doubt
was
gone
and
there
only
remained
fear
to
shake
her
heart
a
day
and
a
night
had
to
be
lived
through
before
she
could
know
her
fate
so
long
must
she
suffer
things
not
to
be
uttered
a
day
and
a
night
and
then
perchance
nay
certainly
the
vanguard
of
a
vast
army
of
hours
there
was
no
passion
now
in
her
thought
of
wilfrid
her
love
had
become
the
sternness
of
resolve
which
dreads
itself
an
hour
ago
her
heart
had
been
pierced
with
in
thinking
that
she
should
suffer
thus
so
far
away
from
him
without
the
possibility
of
his
aid
her
suffering
undreamt
by
him
now
in
her
reviving
strength
she
had
something
of
the
martyr
joy
if
the
worst
came
if
she
had
spoken
to
him
her
last
word
of
tenderness
the
more
reason
that
her
soul
should
keep
unsullied
the
image
of
that
bliss
which
was
the
crown
of
life
his
and
his
only
his
in
the
rapture
of
ideal
love
his
whilst
her
tongue
could
speak
her
heart
conceive
his
name
chapter
xii
the
final
interview
on
six
days
of
the
week
mrs
hood
to
do
her
justice
made
no
show
of
piety
to
the
powers
whose
ordering
of
life
her
tongue
incessantly
accused
if
her
mode
of
sabbatical
observance
was
bitter
the
explanation
was
to
be
sought
in
the
mere
force
of
habit
dating
from
childhood
and
had
indeed
a
pathetic
significance
to
one
sufficiently
disengaged
from
the
sphere
of
her
acerbity
to
be
able
to
judge
fairly
such
manifestations
of
character
a
rigid
veto
upon
all
things
secular
a
preoccupied
severity
of
visage
a
way
of
speaking
which
suggested
difficult
tolerance
of
injury
an
ostentation
of
discomfort
in
bodily
inactivity
these
were
but
traditions
of
happier
times
to
keep
her
sunday
thus
was
to
remind
herself
of
days
when
the
outward
functions
of
respectability
did
in
truth
correspond
to
and
it
is
probable
that
often
enough
poor
woman
the
bitterness
was
not
only
on
her
face
as
a
young
girl
in
her
mother
home
she
had
learnt
that
the
christian
sabbath
was
to
be
distinguished
by
absence
of
joy
and
as
she
sat
through
these
interminable
afternoons
on
her
lap
a
sour
little
book
which
she
did
not
read
the
abandoned
for
one
which
hurt
her
back
the
very
cat
not
allowed
to
enter
the
room
lest
it
should
gambol
here
on
the
verge
of
years
which
touch
the
head
with
grey
her
life
must
have
seemed
to
her
a
weary
pilgrimage
to
a
goal
of
discontent
how
far
away
was
girlish
laughter
how
far
the
blossoming
of
hope
which
should
attain
no
fruitage
and
alas
how
far
the
warm
season
of
the
heart
the
woman
heart
that
loved
and
trusted
that
joyed
in
a
newborn
babe
and
thought
not
of
the
day
when
the
babe
in
growing
to
womanhood
should
have
journeyed
such
lengths
upon
a
road
where
the
mother
might
not
follow
neither
hood
nor
his
daughter
went
to
church
the
former
generally
spent
the
morning
in
his
garret
the
latter
helped
herself
against
the
depression
which
the
consciousness
of
the
day
engendered
by
playing
music
which
respect
would
have
compelled
her
to
refrain
from
had
her
mother
been
present
the
music
was
occasionally
heard
by
an
acquaintance
who
for
some
reason
happened
to
be
abroad
in
church
time
and
mrs
hood
was
duly
informed
of
the
sad
things
done
in
her
absence
but
she
had
the
good
sense
to
forbid
herself
interference
with
emily
mode
of
spending
the
sunday
she
could
not
understand
it
but
her
husband
indifference
to
religion
had
taught
her
to
endure
and
in
truth
her
own
zeal
as
i
have
said
was
not
of
active
colour
discussion
on
such
subjects
there
had
never
been
her
daughter
she
had
learnt
to
concede
was
strangely
other
than
herself
emily
was
old
enough
to
have
regard
for
her
own
hereafter
breakfast
on
sunday
was
an
hour
later
than
on
other
days
and
was
always
a
very
silent
meal
on
the
day
which
we
have
now
reached
it
was
perhaps
more
silent
than
usual
hood
had
a
newspaper
before
him
on
the
table
his
wife
wore
the
wonted
sabbath
absentness
suggestive
of
a
fear
lest
she
should
be
late
for
church
emily
made
a
show
of
eating
but
the
same
diminutive
slice
of
lasted
her
to
the
end
of
the
meal
she
was
suffering
from
a
slight
feverishness
and
her
eyes
unclosed
throughout
the
night
were
heavy
with
a
pressure
which
was
not
of
conscious
fatigue
having
helped
in
clearing
the
table
and
ordering
the
kitchen
she
was
going
upstairs
when
her
mother
spoke
to
her
for
the
first
time
see
you
still
got
your
headache
mrs
hood
said
with
plaintiveness
which
was
not
condolence
shall
go
out
a
little
before
was
the
reply
her
mother
dismally
admitted
the
wisdom
of
the
proposal
and
emily
went
to
her
room
before
long
the
bell
of
the
opposite
began
its
summoning
a
single
querulous
bell
jerked
with
irregular
rapidity
the
bells
of
pendal
church
sent
forth
a
more
kindly
bidding
but
their
music
was
marred
by
the
harsh
clanging
so
near
at
hand
emily
heard
and
did
not
hear
when
she
had
done
housemaid
office
in
her
room
she
sat
propping
her
hot
brows
waiting
for
her
mother
descent
in
readiness
for
church
at
the
sound
of
the
opening
and
closing
bedroom
door
she
rose
and
accompanied
her
mother
to
the
parlour
mrs
hood
was
in
her
usual
nervous
hurry
giving
a
survey
to
each
room
before
departure
uttering
a
hasty
word
or
two
then
away
with
constricted
features
the
girl
ascended
again
and
as
soon
as
the
chapel
bell
had
ceased
its
last
notes
of
iteration
began
to
attire
herself
hastily
for
walking
when
ready
she
unlocked
a
drawer
and
took
from
it
an
envelope
of
heavy
contents
which
lay
ready
to
her
hand
then
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
listened
above
there
was
a
light
footfall
passing
constantly
hither
and
thither
leaving
the
room
with
caution
she
passed
downstairs
noiselessly
and
quitted
the
house
by
the
back
door
whence
by
a
circuit
she
gained
the
road
her
walk
was
towards
the
heath
as
soon
as
she
entered
upon
it
she
proceeded
rapidly
so
rapidly
indeed
that
before
long
she
had
to
check
herself
and
take
breath
no
sun
shone
and
the
air
was
very
still
and
warm
to
her
it
seemed
oppressive
over
dunfield
hung
a
vast
pile
of
purple
cloud
against
which
the
wreaths
of
mill
smoke
slighter
than
on
lay
with
a
dead
whiteness
the
heath
was
solitary
a
rabbit
now
and
then
started
from
a
brake
and
here
and
there
grazed
sheep
emily
had
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
save
when
she
looked
rapidly
ahead
to
measure
the
upward
distance
she
had
still
to
toil
over
on
reaching
the
quarry
she
stayed
her
feet
the
speed
at
which
she
had
come
and
an
agitation
which
was
increasing
made
breathing
so
difficult
that
she
turned
a
few
paces
aside
and
sat
down
upon
a
rough
block
of
stone
long
since
quarried
and
left
unused
just
before
her
was
a
small
patch
of
marshy
ground
long
grass
growing
about
a
little
pool
a
rook
had
alighted
on
the
margin
and
was
pecking
about
presently
it
rose
on
its
heavy
wings
she
watched
it
flap
athwart
the
dun
sky
then
her
eye
fell
on
a
little
yellow
flower
near
her
feet
a
flower
she
did
not
know
she
plucked
and
examined
it
then
let
it
drop
carelessly
from
her
hand
the
air
was
growing
brown
a
storm
threatened
she
looked
about
her
with
a
hasty
fear
then
resumed
her
walk
to
the
upper
part
of
the
heath
beaching
the
smooth
sward
she
made
straight
across
it
for
house
crossing
the
garden
she
was
just
at
the
front
door
when
it
was
opened
and
by
dagworthy
himself
his
eyes
fell
before
her
you
come
this
way
he
said
indistinctly
he
led
into
the
large
where
he
had
previously
entertained
emily
and
her
father
as
soon
as
he
had
closed
the
door
he
took
eager
steps
towards
her
have
come
he
said
told
me
you
would
come
this
morning
i
watched
at
the
window
for
you
the
assurance
of
victory
had
softened
him
his
voice
was
like
that
of
one
who
greets
a
loving
mistress
his
gaze
clung
to
her
have
come
to
bring
you
this
emily
replied
putting
upon
the
table
the
heavy
envelope
is
the
money
we
owe
you
dagworthy
laughed
but
his
eyes
were
gathering
trouble
owe
me
nothing
he
said
affecting
easiness
do
you
mean
that
emily
gave
him
a
direct
look
her
manner
had
now
nothing
of
fear
nor
even
the
diffidence
with
which
she
had
formerly
addressed
him
she
spoke
with
a
certain
remoteness
as
if
her
business
with
him
were
formal
the
lines
of
her
mouth
were
hard
her
heavy
lids
only
half
raised
themselves
mean
that
you
owe
nothing
of
this
kind
he
answered
rather
confusedly
his
confidence
was
less
marked
her
look
overcame
his
ten
pounds
do
he
added
is
this
money
is
my
own
i
have
earned
it
your
father
know
you
are
paying
it
he
does
not
i
was
not
likely
to
speak
to
him
of
what
you
told
me
there
is
the
debt
dagworthy
we
have
paid
it
and
now
i
will
leave
you
he
examined
her
even
yet
he
could
not
be
sure
that
he
understood
in
admitting
her
he
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
she
could
come
with
but
one
purpose
it
was
but
the
confirmation
of
the
certain
hope
in
which
he
had
lived
through
the
night
was
the
girl
a
simpleton
had
she
got
it
into
her
head
that
repayment
in
this
way
discharged
his
hold
upon
her
father
it
was
possible
women
are
so
ludicrously
ignorant
of
affairs
he
smiled
though
darkly
have
you
brought
this
money
he
asked
she
was
already
moving
nearer
to
the
door
he
put
himself
in
her
way
good
do
you
imagine
this
is
perhaps
i
pay
it
because
i
wish
to
is
it
your
notion
that
this
puts
your
father
straight
do
you
think
this
is
a
way
out
of
his
difficulty
have
not
thought
that
but
it
was
only
to
restore
the
money
that
i
came
there
was
silence
you
forgotten
he
asked
half
wonderingly
half
with
quiet
menace
i
said
to
you
yesterday
see
my
answer
said
emily
pointing
hastily
to
the
table
owe
you
that
but
i
can
give
you
nothing
more
her
voice
quivered
as
she
continued
you
said
to
me
yesterday
was
said
without
thought
or
only
with
evil
thoughts
since
then
you
have
had
hours
of
reflection
it
is
not
in
your
power
it
would
be
in
the
power
of
no
man
who
is
not
utterly
base
and
wicked
to
repeat
such
words
this
morning
dagworthy
i
believe
in
the
affection
you
have
professed
for
me
feeling
that
you
are
incapable
of
dastardly
cruelty
i
will
not
believe
your
tongue
against
yourself
in
a
moment
of
you
spoke
words
which
you
will
regret
through
your
life
for
they
were
inhuman
and
were
spoken
to
a
defenceless
girl
after
hearing
them
i
can
not
beg
your
mercy
for
my
father
but
you
know
that
misfortune
which
strikes
him
falls
also
upon
me
you
have
done
me
the
greatest
wrong
that
man
can
do
to
woman
you
owe
me
what
reparation
is
in
your
power
she
had
not
thought
to
speak
thus
since
daylight
dawned
her
heart
had
felt
too
numb
too
dead
barely
to
tell
him
that
she
had
no
answer
to
his
words
was
the
purpose
with
which
she
had
set
out
the
moment
prompted
her
utterance
and
words
came
without
reflection
it
was
a
noble
speech
and
nobly
delivered
the
voice
was
uncertain
at
times
but
it
betrayed
no
weakness
of
resolve
no
dread
of
what
might
follow
the
last
sentences
were
spoken
with
a
dignity
which
rebuked
rather
than
supplicated
dagworthy
head
bowed
as
he
listened
he
came
nearer
you
think
me
he
asked
under
his
breath
mere
ignorant
lout
who
has
to
be
shamed
before
he
knows
what
manly
and
what
is
do
you
think
because
i
a
manufacturer
and
the
son
of
one
that
i
no
thought
or
feeling
above
my
trade
i
know
as
well
as
you
can
tell
me
though
you
speak
with
words
i
could
command
that
i
doing
a
mean
and
a
vile
thing
there
hear
me
say
it
emily
hood
but
it
not
a
cruel
thing
i
want
to
compel
you
to
do
what
in
a
few
years
you
be
glad
of
i
want
you
to
accept
love
such
as
no
other
man
can
give
you
and
with
it
the
command
of
pretty
well
everything
you
can
wish
for
i
want
to
be
a
slave
at
your
feet
with
no
other
work
in
life
than
finding
out
your
desires
and
satisfying
them
you
not
to
be
tempted
with
money
and
i
do
try
to
but
i
value
the
money
because
it
will
give
me
power
to
show
my
love
and
mind
what
i
say
ask
yourself
if
it
true
if
you
had
been
engaged
already
you
have
listened
to
me
i
feel
that
power
in
myself
i
know
i
should
have
made
you
care
for
me
by
loving
you
as
desperately
as
i
do
i
would
have
let
you
refuse
me
you
hear
emily
emily
emily
emily
it
does
me
good
to
call
you
by
your
name
i
have
done
so
before
have
i
emily
not
a
cruel
thing
because
i
offer
you
more
than
any
man
living
can
more
of
that
for
which
you
care
most
the
life
a
highly
educated
woman
can
appreciate
you
shall
travel
where
you
will
you
shall
buy
books
and
pictures
and
all
else
to
your
heart
content
and
after
all
you
shall
love
me
that
a
bold
word
but
i
tell
you
i
feel
the
power
in
me
to
win
your
love
i
not
hateful
to
you
even
now
you
ca
really
despise
me
for
you
know
that
whatever
i
do
is
for
no
mean
purpose
there
is
no
woman
living
like
you
and
to
make
you
my
wife
i
am
prepared
to
do
anything
however
vile
it
seems
some
day
you
forgive
it
all
because
some
day
you
love
me
it
was
speaking
as
he
had
never
yet
done
he
assumed
that
his
end
was
won
and
something
of
the
triumph
of
passion
endued
his
words
with
a
joyous
fervour
very
possibly
there
was
truth
in
much
that
he
said
for
he
spoke
with
the
intense
conviction
which
fulfils
prophecies
but
the
only
effect
was
to
force
emily
back
upon
her
cold
defiance
am
in
your
house
dagworthy
she
said
you
can
compel
me
to
hear
whatever
you
choose
to
say
but
i
have
no
other
answer
than
that
you
know
i
wish
to
leave
you
his
flushed
eagerness
could
not
at
once
adapt
itself
to
another
tone
you
do
wish
to
leave
me
you
want
to
see
that
i
am
a
man
of
my
word
that
i
mean
what
i
say
and
am
not
afraid
to
stick
to
it
emily
you
do
leave
me
till
you
have
promised
to
be
my
wife
you
a
noble
girl
you
would
be
frightened
into
yielding
and
it
is
that
way
i
want
to
have
you
you
more
now
in
my
eyes
than
ever
it
shall
be
love
for
love
emily
you
will
marry
me
what
resources
of
passion
the
man
was
exhibiting
by
forethought
he
could
have
devised
no
word
of
these
speeches
which
he
uttered
with
such
vigour
it
was
not
he
who
spoke
but
the
very
love
god
within
him
he
asked
the
last
question
with
a
voice
subdued
in
tenderness
his
eyes
had
a
softer
fire
emily
gave
her
answer
would
not
marry
you
though
you
stood
to
kill
me
if
i
refused
no
bravado
no
unmeasured
vehemence
of
tone
but
spoken
as
it
would
have
been
had
the
very
weapon
of
death
gleamed
in
his
hand
he
knew
that
this
was
final
you
are
willing
that
your
father
shall
be
put
into
the
dock
at
the
morning
you
can
do
that
it
must
be
so
i
you
know
very
well
i
have
the
power
to
and
you
ought
to
know
by
now
that
i
stick
at
nothing
go
home
and
think
about
it
it
is
useless
i
have
thought
if
you
think
still
to
make
me
yield
by
this
fear
it
is
better
that
you
should
act
at
once
i
will
tell
you
if
i
were
free
if
i
had
the
power
to
give
myself
to
you
in
marriage
it
would
make
your
threat
of
no
more
avail
i
love
my
father
to
you
i
can
not
say
more
than
that
but
though
i
would
give
my
life
to
save
his
from
ruin
i
could
not
give
my
father
would
not
wish
me
oh
never
my
woman
honour
you
will
find
it
hard
to
understand
me
for
you
seem
not
to
know
the
meaning
of
such
words
she
closed
with
stern
bitterness
compelled
to
it
by
the
tone
of
his
last
bidding
a
glorious
beauty
flashed
in
her
face
alas
wilfrid
athel
would
never
know
the
pride
of
seeing
thus
the
woman
he
knew
so
noble
but
wilfrid
was
in
her
heart
his
soul
allied
itself
with
hers
and
gave
her
double
strength
dagworthy
had
wrought
for
her
that
which
in
the
night
conflict
she
could
not
bring
about
by
her
own
force
knowing
in
the
face
of
utter
despair
the
whole
depth
of
the
love
with
which
she
held
to
her
father
she
could
yet
speak
his
doom
with
calmness
with
clear
intelligence
that
the
sacrifice
she
was
asked
to
make
was
disproportionate
to
the
disaster
threatened
he
answered
with
cold
decision
you
who
do
know
me
i
nothing
more
to
say
to
you
you
are
at
liberty
to
go
your
father
will
be
before
the
magistrates
emily
moved
to
the
door
the
sound
of
the
words
had
blanched
her
lips
she
felt
that
if
she
would
keep
hold
upon
her
bodily
strength
she
must
breathe
the
outer
air
here
i
say
he
exclaimed
stepping
to
the
table
the
money
i
nothing
to
do
with
that
she
made
a
motion
with
her
hand
but
hastened
still
and
escaped
once
in
the
garden
she
all
but
ran
thinking
she
heard
his
footsteps
in
pursuit
and
smitten
with
that
sudden
terror
which
comes
sometimes
when
a
danger
is
escaped
but
she
had
gained
the
heath
and
it
was
certain
now
that
he
had
not
tried
to
overtake
her
a
glance
back
showed
her
that
no
one
was
in
sight
she
walked
rapidly
on
though
her
heart
seemed
about
to
burst
walked
without
pausing
till
she
had
reached
the
quarry
here
she
sat
on
the
same
stone
as
before
she
was
in
dread
of
fainting
the
anguish
of
her
leaping
blood
was
intolerable
she
had
neither
sight
nor
hearing
but
the
crisis
of
suffering
passed
she
let
her
head
fall
forward
and
buried
it
upon
her
lap
perhaps
for
ten
minutes
she
remained
thus
then
a
great
crash
from
the
near
heavens
caused
her
to
look
up
it
was
raining
had
rained
since
she
sat
there
though
she
had
not
known
it
in
the
little
pool
before
her
great
drops
splashed
and
made
a
miniature
tempest
the
yellow
flower
she
had
plucked
lay
close
by
and
was
beaten
by
the
rain
it
lightened
vividly
and
there
followed
heavier
thunder
than
before
she
wished
to
shed
tears
tears
were
choking
her
but
would
not
rise
and
shed
themselves
she
could
only
sob
aloud
hysterically
the
words
and
broke
from
her
lips
several
times
was
there
metal
poured
upon
her
forehead
it
cost
her
a
great
effort
to
rise
and
walk
homewards
the
rain
streamed
down
but
she
could
no
longer
hasten
still
she
reached
the
house
before
her
mother
return
from
church
and
she
was
glad
of
that
chapter
xiii
the
cutting
of
the
knot
for
the
final
failure
of
his
plot
dagworthy
was
in
no
wise
prepared
he
had
anticipated
prolonged
scenes
passionate
pleadings
appeals
to
his
better
nature
and
to
his
shame
but
that
his
threat
should
prove
ineffectual
was
not
among
his
fears
illustrating
a
tendency
of
human
nature
his
reckless
egoism
based
its
confidence
on
the
presumed
existence
of
heroic
in
his
victim
starting
from
a
knowledge
of
the
close
affection
between
emily
and
her
father
the
logic
of
desire
had
abundant
arguments
to
prove
that
the
girl
must
and
could
act
in
but
one
way
dagworthy
was
not
an
original
mind
the
of
daughters
not
of
sons
on
their
parents
behalf
is
among
vulgar
conceptions
of
the
befitting
and
it
is
more
than
probable
that
the
was
supported
by
precedents
drawn
from
his
readings
in
popular
fiction
his
imagination
as
is
commonly
the
case
was
only
strong
in
the
direction
of
his
wishes
neglecting
emily
avowed
attachment
to
an
accepted
lover
whose
shadowiness
made
him
difficult
to
realise
even
as
an
obstacle
he
dwelt
persistently
on
the
thought
of
hood
position
and
found
it
impossible
to
imagine
a
refusal
on
emily
part
to
avert
from
her
father
the
direst
of
calamities
that
other
motive
the
strength
of
which
in
emily
was
independent
of
her
plighted
troth
was
not
within
the
range
of
his
conceptions
that
a
woman
should
face
martyrdom
rather
than
marry
without
love
was
a
contingency
alien
to
his
experience
and
to
the
philosophy
wherewith
nature
had
endowed
him
in
spite
of
the
attributes
of
nobleness
which
so
impressed
him
in
the
object
of
his
love
dagworthy
could
give
no
credit
to
the
utterance
of
such
a
feeling
whilst
emily
spoke
he
was
for
the
moment
overcome
by
a
vision
of
vague
glories
reflecting
on
her
words
he
interpreted
them
as
merely
emphasising
her
determination
to
wed
one
only
their
effect
was
to
give
new
food
to
his
jealousy
that
solace
of
men
unconscious
pessimism
the
faith
pathetically
clung
to
that
in
frustration
of
desire
is
the
soul
health
is
but
too
apt
to
prove
itself
fallacious
just
where
its
efficiency
would
show
most
glorious
is
there
not
lurking
somewhere
in
your
mind
not
withstanding
the
protests
of
your
realistic
intelligence
more
than
half
a
hope
that
richard
dagworthy
will
emerge
radiant
from
the
gulf
into
which
his
passions
have
plunged
him
for
the
credit
of
human
nature
but
what
if
human
nature
oft
establishes
its
credit
by
the
failures
over
which
we
shake
our
heads
of
many
ways
to
the
of
souls
the
way
of
affliction
is
but
one
cling
if
it
please
you
to
the
assurance
that
this
is
the
treading
of
the
elect
instinct
will
justify
itself
in
many
to
whom
the
denial
of
a
supreme
need
has
been
the
closing
of
the
upward
path
midway
in
his
life
when
slow
development
waited
but
occasion
to
establish
the
possibilities
of
a
passionate
character
dagworthy
underwent
the
trial
destined
to
determine
the
future
course
of
his
life
one
hesitates
to
impute
it
to
him
as
a
fault
that
he
was
not
of
the
elect
a
mere
uneducated
englishman
hitherto
balancing
always
between
the
calls
from
above
and
from
below
with
one
miserable
delusion
and
its
consequent
bitterness
ever
active
in
his
memory
he
could
make
no
distinction
between
the
objects
which
with
vehemence
he
desired
and
the
spiritual
advantage
which
he
felt
the
attainment
would
bring
to
him
and
for
the
simple
reason
that
in
his
case
no
such
distinction
existed
even
as
the
childhood
of
civilisation
knows
virtue
only
in
the
form
of
a
concrete
deity
so
to
dagworthy
the
higher
life
of
which
he
was
capable
took
shape
as
a
mortal
woman
and
to
possess
her
was
to
fulfil
his
being
with
the
certainty
that
she
was
beyond
his
reach
came
failure
of
the
vital
forces
which
promised
so
much
a
pity
for
it
flatters
us
poor
mortals
to
discern
instances
of
the
soul
independence
of
the
body
i
would
it
had
been
otherwise
with
dagworthy
i
have
but
to
relate
the
facts
it
was
no
dark
angel
that
had
whispered
to
him
through
the
hours
of
his
waiting
for
emily
surrender
high
aims
pure
ambitions
were
stronger
in
him
than
they
ever
had
been
stronger
than
they
ever
would
be
again
it
was
when
emily
left
him
with
those
proud
words
of
defiance
that
the
veritable
demon
took
stand
at
his
ear
the
leaping
fruitful
sap
of
his
being
turned
itself
to
gall
he
sat
with
a
brow
of
blackness
cruel
projects
worked
in
his
brain
not
only
had
he
lost
her
but
his
loss
was
another
gain
the
pricking
of
jealousy
for
a
while
suspended
again
became
maddening
he
had
heard
her
say
that
she
would
die
rather
than
be
his
wife
judge
then
what
must
be
her
love
of
the
man
she
bud
chosen
his
desire
now
was
to
do
her
injury
and
his
fiercest
torment
was
the
thought
that
he
dared
not
fulfil
the
menace
with
which
he
had
hoped
to
overwhelm
her
if
he
prosecuted
hood
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
would
inevitably
come
out
emily
had
friends
in
dunfield
and
if
her
father
guilt
were
once
disclosed
there
would
be
no
reason
for
her
concealment
of
what
had
happened
facts
like
these
put
forward
in
mitigation
of
punishment
would
supply
the
town
with
a
fearful
subject
of
comment
nay
was
he
safe
from
the
clutch
of
the
law
of
these
things
he
had
not
troubled
to
think
so
assured
was
he
that
the
mere
threat
would
suffice
from
his
present
point
of
view
it
was
easy
enough
to
see
that
the
plot
had
been
a
wretched
piece
of
bungling
in
failing
of
its
end
it
became
the
project
of
a
simpleton
had
the
girl
herself
been
cool
enough
to
see
this
did
she
defy
him
in
knowledge
of
the
weakness
of
his
position
probably
not
in
that
case
she
would
have
spoken
differently
she
had
granted
and
clearly
with
sincerity
his
power
to
do
what
he
threatened
and
then
the
fact
remained
that
he
could
injure
hood
irremediably
by
means
short
of
criminal
proceedings
emily
his
reasoning
was
accurate
enough
had
not
been
careful
to
distinguish
between
modes
of
injury
where
each
meant
ruin
what
he
dared
to
do
he
would
he
was
acquainted
with
the
wretched
story
of
struggle
which
had
ended
in
hood
taking
refuge
as
a
clerk
with
a
mean
salary
from
the
extremities
of
destitution
to
dismiss
the
man
after
private
accusation
would
be
to
render
his
prospects
worse
than
ever
for
it
was
easy
to
whisper
here
and
there
the
grounds
of
dismissal
emily
mouth
would
be
closed
by
the
necessity
of
keeping
secret
her
father
dishonesty
but
this
revenge
fell
short
of
his
appetite
for
cruelty
it
would
strike
the
girl
herself
only
indirectly
and
it
was
possible
that
her
future
husband
might
have
it
in
his
power
to
give
her
parents
aid
yet
he
persuaded
himself
that
the
case
was
otherwise
emily
secrecy
had
impressed
him
with
the
belief
that
the
match
she
contemplated
was
anything
but
a
brilliant
one
could
he
devise
no
graver
hurt
through
the
sunday
afternoon
and
the
night
which
followed
he
pondered
ceaselessly
on
means
of
evil
delighted
to
flesh
his
fangs
even
in
imagination
many
a
vile
plan
dwelt
with
him
which
he
knew
he
durst
not
put
into
practice
monday
morning
came
and
found
him
no
further
than
the
crime
which
had
first
suggested
itself
fevered
with
eagerness
to
accomplish
that
at
least
he
left
home
earlier
than
usual
it
might
be
that
the
day
would
bring
fresh
counsel
to
emily
the
hours
following
upon
her
visit
to
the
house
on
the
heath
had
brought
unnatural
quietness
physical
suffering
troubled
her
but
the
energies
of
her
mind
were
for
the
time
expended
the
aching
of
her
brow
involved
thought
in
sluggishness
she
did
not
shun
her
parents
and
even
talked
with
them
in
a
listless
way
solitude
would
have
been
irksome
to
her
just
now
for
once
she
felt
glad
of
her
mother
way
of
spending
sunday
to
sit
inactive
was
all
that
she
desired
it
was
understood
that
her
head
distressed
her
in
the
afternoon
and
again
in
the
evening
the
single
bell
of
the
chapel
clanged
for
worshippers
mrs
hood
was
not
in
the
habit
of
attending
service
more
than
once
in
the
day
she
sat
on
her
uneasy
chair
at
times
appearing
to
read
more
often
gazing
out
of
the
windows
the
road
had
more
traffic
than
on
for
it
was
the
recreation
of
a
certain
class
of
dunfieldians
to
drive
out
in
parties
to
the
heath
either
hiring
a
vehicle
or
using
their
own
it
would
have
been
a
consolation
to
observe
that
in
the
latter
case
the
quadruped
employed
benefited
by
its
owner
regard
for
his
own
interests
possibly
an
acute
spectator
might
have
discerned
gradations
of
inhumanity
to
the
casual
eye
there
showed
but
a
succession
of
animals
urged
to
the
utmost
speed
the
national
predilection
exhibiting
itself
crudely
in
this
locality
towards
nightfall
the
returned
driving
with
the
heightened
energy
attributable
to
bacchic
inspiration
singing
shouting
exchanging
racy
banter
with
pedestrians
so
the
hours
dragged
wearily
on
wheezed
out
one
after
one
by
the
clock
on
the
stairs
hood
was
at
no
time
fertile
in
topics
of
conversation
he
maintained
almost
unbroken
silence
tea
was
prepared
partaken
of
removed
supper
three
hours
later
the
day
closed
with
rain
and
a
rising
wind
emily
heard
it
about
the
house
as
she
lay
through
hours
of
sleeplessness
at
first
a
light
slumber
had
come
to
her
it
was
broken
by
the
clock
striking
eleven
probably
she
was
roused
at
the
first
stroke
for
failing
to
count
the
number
seemed
to
her
so
interminable
that
she
started
up
and
made
to
herself
fretful
complaint
pain
was
weakening
her
she
found
herself
crying
in
a
weary
desolate
way
and
could
not
stop
her
tears
for
a
long
time
the
gusts
of
wind
went
by
her
windows
and
bore
their
voices
away
on
to
the
common
wailing
and
sobbing
in
the
far
distance
rain
spattered
the
windows
at
times
when
her
tears
ceased
emily
hid
her
face
in
the
pillow
and
moaned
often
she
uttered
wilfrid
name
she
should
by
agreement
have
written
to
him
but
to
do
so
had
been
impossible
he
would
be
uneasy
at
her
silence
oh
bow
could
she
ever
write
to
him
again
what
might
happen
at
the
thought
she
held
her
breath
and
lay
in
silence
she
rose
in
time
for
breakfast
but
at
the
last
moment
could
not
bring
herself
to
go
down
to
the
meal
to
face
her
father
was
impossible
her
mother
came
to
the
door
and
emily
answered
her
that
she
would
lie
for
an
hour
or
two
longer
being
still
unwell
during
the
that
followed
she
sat
listening
intently
to
every
sound
in
the
house
hood
having
breakfasted
came
upstairs
and
entered
his
room
when
a
few
minutes
later
he
came
out
his
steps
made
a
pause
at
her
threshold
her
heart
beat
in
sickening
fear
she
could
not
have
found
voice
to
reply
to
him
had
he
spoken
but
he
did
not
do
so
and
went
downstairs
she
heard
him
open
the
front
door
and
sprang
to
the
window
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
at
the
gate
he
turned
and
looked
up
to
her
window
his
face
was
sorrowful
emily
held
back
that
he
might
not
see
her
when
it
was
too
late
she
could
not
understand
this
movement
and
longed
to
wave
him
a
she
threw
up
the
sash
her
father
did
not
turn
again
we
follow
him
not
very
long
after
his
arrival
at
the
mill
dagworthy
himself
appeared
hood
evil
conscience
led
him
to
regard
with
apprehension
every
unusual
event
dagworthy
unwonted
earliness
was
still
troubling
his
mind
when
a
messenger
summoned
him
to
the
private
room
there
was
nothing
extraordinary
in
this
but
hood
as
he
crossed
the
passage
shook
with
fear
before
knocking
and
pushing
open
the
door
he
dashed
drops
from
his
forehead
with
his
hand
dagworthy
was
alone
sitting
at
the
desk
the
door
he
said
without
turning
his
eyes
from
a
letter
he
was
reading
the
clerk
obeyed
and
stood
for
a
full
minute
before
anything
more
was
addressed
to
him
he
knew
that
the
worst
had
come
dagworthy
faced
half
round
day
early
last
week
he
began
averting
his
eyes
after
a
single
glance
was
looking
over
one
of
these
ledgers
he
pointed
to
the
shelf
left
an
envelope
to
mark
a
place
i
forgot
about
it
and
now
that
i
look
the
envelope
has
gone
it
contained
a
of
course
you
came
across
it
in
the
course
of
your
work
it
was
rather
an
assertion
than
a
question
whilst
he
was
speaking
the
courage
of
despair
had
taken
hold
upon
his
hearer
like
the
terrible
flash
of
memory
which
is
said
to
strike
the
brain
of
a
drowning
man
there
smote
on
hood
mind
a
vision
of
the
home
he
had
just
quitted
of
all
it
had
been
and
all
it
might
still
be
to
him
this
was
his
life
and
he
must
save
it
by
whatever
means
he
knew
nothing
but
that
necessity
all
else
of
consciousness
was
vague
swimming
horror
sir
was
his
reply
given
with
perfect
firmness
found
no
envelope
dagworthy
coarse
lips
formed
a
smile
hard
and
cruel
he
faced
his
clerk
you
did
which
ledger
did
you
leave
it
sir
hood
asked
the
dryness
of
his
throat
rendering
speech
more
difficult
as
he
proceeded
still
his
eye
was
fixed
steadily
on
dagworthy
face
it
was
life
at
stake
have
not
had
them
all
do
remember
which
it
was
replied
the
other
it
does
much
matter
since
i
happen
to
know
the
note
i
dare
say
you
remember
buying
a
new
hat
in
hebsworth
last
friday
the
love
of
inflicting
pain
for
its
own
sake
an
element
of
human
nature
only
overgrown
by
civilisation
was
showing
itself
strongly
in
dagworthy
he
was
prolonging
this
scene
on
his
way
to
the
mill
he
had
felt
that
the
task
would
be
rather
disagreeable
but
we
can
not
nurture
baseness
with
impunity
and
face
to
face
with
a
man
under
torture
he
enjoyed
the
spectacle
as
he
scarcely
would
have
done
a
little
while
ago
perhaps
the
feeling
that
his
first
blow
at
emily
was
actually
struck
gave
him
satisfaction
which
he
dwelt
upon
hood
made
no
reply
to
the
question
he
would
not
admit
to
himself
that
this
was
the
end
but
he
had
no
voice
hear
me
dagworthy
reminded
him
i
bought
a
hat
you
paid
for
it
with
the
note
i
have
lost
i
happen
to
know
it
there
was
silence
you
understand
that
under
ordinary
circumstances
you
would
be
at
once
given
in
charge
dagworthy
spoke
almost
cheerfully
i
do
do
that
it
out
of
consideration
for
your
age
and
your
family
but
as
you
are
not
to
be
trusted
of
course
i
ca
continue
to
employ
you
a
wild
hope
sprang
in
hood
eyes
and
the
rush
of
gratitude
at
his
heart
compelled
him
to
speak
dagworthy
you
arc
generous
you
have
always
treated
me
with
kindness
and
this
is
how
i
repay
you
it
was
base
i
deserve
no
mercy
the
temptation
he
grew
incoherent
have
been
driven
hard
by
want
of
money
i
know
that
is
no
excuse
i
had
no
intention
at
first
of
taking
the
money
i
came
here
to
give
it
you
i
should
have
done
so
without
a
thought
of
dishonesty
but
you
happened
to
be
away
in
going
to
hebsworth
i
lost
my
hat
and
i
had
not
enough
money
of
my
own
to
buy
another
i
had
to
change
the
note
that
was
the
temptation
i
will
return
but
for
this
work
here
i
might
by
now
have
been
in
the
workhouse
try
sir
to
forgive
my
baseness
i
can
not
forgive
myself
dagworthy
turned
his
face
away
he
said
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
that
too
late
hood
pursued
spurred
by
foresight
of
penury
perhaps
as
much
as
by
dread
of
having
to
explain
his
dismissal
at
home
for
penury
had
been
his
relentless
foe
through
life
sir
is
it
in
vain
to
ask
you
to
give
me
another
chance
i
am
not
a
dishonest
man
never
before
has
such
a
temptation
come
to
me
and
surely
never
would
again
will
you
i
entreat
you
to
think
what
it
means
at
my
age
my
wife
i
ought
to
be
content
with
thanking
you
for
having
spared
me
how
few
would
have
done
that
let
me
continue
to
serve
you
a
lower
salary
if
it
be
ever
so
little
till
i
have
regained
your
confidence
dagworthy
was
drumming
with
his
fingers
on
the
desk
not
for
an
instant
did
he
falter
in
his
purpose
but
it
gave
him
pleasure
to
be
thus
prayed
to
the
employer
of
labour
is
not
as
a
rule
troubled
with
a
lively
imagination
a
pity
for
it
would
surely
gratify
him
to
feel
in
its
fulness
at
times
his
power
of
life
and
death
native
defect
and
force
of
habit
render
it
a
matter
of
course
that
a
small
population
should
eat
or
starve
at
his
pleasure
possibly
his
resolution
in
seasons
of
strike
is
now
and
then
attributable
to
awakening
of
insight
and
pleasure
in
prolonging
his
role
of
dagworthy
appreciated
his
despair
all
the
more
that
it
made
present
to
him
the
wretchedness
that
would
fall
on
emily
think
not
that
the
man
was
unashamed
with
difficulty
he
could
bring
himself
to
meet
hood
look
but
may
well
consist
with
perseverance
in
gratification
of
ignoble
instincts
when
hood
ceased
there
came
this
reply
shall
not
grant
what
you
ask
simply
because
it
is
against
my
principles
i
let
you
off
for
it
would
do
me
no
good
to
punish
you
and
certainly
as
regards
yourself
the
lesson
will
be
enough
but
i
keep
you
in
my
employ
so
we
talk
no
more
about
it
you
were
going
to
take
your
holiday
from
the
end
of
this
week
i
think
very
well
let
it
be
supposed
that
you
begin
instead
and
in
a
day
or
two
write
me
a
note
giving
up
your
place
this
was
not
yielding
on
dagworthy
part
it
merely
occurred
to
him
as
a
way
of
protecting
himself
if
there
should
be
future
need
hood
was
standing
with
bent
head
he
seemed
unable
either
to
speak
or
to
depart
may
go
dagworthy
said
i
may
refer
to
you
asked
the
wretched
man
roused
by
the
bidding
i
think
not
was
the
calm
reply
of
course
you
are
willing
that
i
should
state
the
plain
facts
of
the
case
hood
staggered
from
the
room
when
emily
came
down
in
the
course
of
the
morning
her
appearance
was
such
that
her
mother
uttered
an
exclamation
of
alarm
child
you
are
like
a
ghost
why
did
you
stay
in
bed
i
was
just
coming
up
to
you
hoping
you
been
asleep
i
must
go
for
evans
at
once
emily
resisted
i
certainly
shall
say
what
you
like
no
headache
would
make
you
look
like
that
and
you
as
feverish
as
you
can
be
go
up
to
bed
again
you
hardly
look
though
as
if
you
could
climb
the
stairs
put
on
my
things
and
go
round
it
was
only
by
affecting
anger
that
emily
could
overcome
her
purpose
she
did
indeed
feel
ill
but
to
submit
to
treatment
was
impossible
whilst
this
day
lasted
far
worse
than
her
bodily
fever
was
the
mental
anguish
which
would
not
allow
her
to
remain
in
one
place
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
and
did
not
suffer
the
pretence
of
occupation
how
would
it
come
about
was
her
father
at
this
moment
in
the
hands
of
the
police
how
would
the
first
news
come
to
banbrigg
and
when
the
sound
of
every
vehicle
on
the
road
was
an
approaching
terror
she
was
constantly
at
the
window
to
watch
the
people
who
came
near
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
she
realised
what
this
trial
would
be
yet
her
anticipations
had
fallen
far
below
the
experience
of
these
fearful
hours
at
instants
she
all
but
repented
what
she
had
done
and
asked
herself
if
there
was
not
even
now
a
chance
of
somehow
saving
her
father
the
face
which
he
had
raised
to
the
window
as
he
left
home
smote
her
heart
not
a
word
of
kindness
had
she
spoken
to
him
since
friday
night
oh
what
inconceivable
cruelty
had
possessed
her
that
she
let
him
go
this
morning
without
even
having
touched
his
hand
could
her
mind
endure
this
was
she
not
now
and
then
near
to
delirium
once
she
went
to
the
window
and
to
her
horror
could
see
nothing
a
blue
and
red
mist
hovered
before
her
eyes
it
left
her
but
other
symptoms
of
physical
distress
grew
from
hour
to
hour
and
she
dreaded
lest
strength
to
endure
might
wholly
forsake
her
before
night
came
she
tried
to
picture
her
father
returning
as
usual
human
pity
might
have
spoken
even
in
dagworthy
heart
or
if
not
so
then
he
might
have
been
induced
to
forbear
by
a
hope
of
winning
her
gratitude
very
agony
made
her
feel
almost
capable
of
rewarding
such
mercy
for
wilfrid
seemed
now
very
far
away
and
her
love
had
fallen
to
the
background
it
was
not
the
supreme
motive
of
her
being
as
hitherto
would
she
suffer
thus
for
wilfrid
the
question
forced
itself
upon
her
and
for
reply
she
shuddered
such
bonds
seemed
artificial
compared
with
those
which
linked
her
to
her
father
the
love
which
was
coeval
with
her
life
all
feeling
is
so
relative
to
circumstances
and
what
makes
so
stable
as
the
cement
of
habit
in
the
early
hours
of
the
afternoon
a
lull
of
utter
weariness
relieved
her
she
lay
upon
the
couch
and
all
but
slept
it
was
something
between
sleep
and
loss
of
consciousness
following
on
excessive
pain
she
awoke
to
find
the
doctor
bending
over
her
mrs
hood
had
become
so
alarmed
that
she
had
despatched
a
neighbour
secretly
on
the
errand
emily
was
passive
and
by
her
way
of
speaking
half
disguised
the
worst
features
of
her
state
nevertheless
the
order
was
given
that
she
should
go
to
bed
she
promised
to
obey
soon
as
father
comes
she
said
when
alone
again
with
her
mother
can
not
be
long
till
his
time
she
would
not
yield
beyond
this
but
the
hour
of
return
came
and
her
father
delayed
then
was
every
minute
an
eternity
no
longer
able
to
keep
her
reclining
position
she
stood
again
by
the
window
and
her
eyes
lost
their
vision
from
straining
upon
one
spot
that
at
which
hood
would
first
appear
she
leaned
her
head
upon
the
and
let
her
ears
take
their
turn
of
watching
the
first
touch
of
a
hand
at
the
gate
would
reach
her
but
there
came
none
can
hours
thus
be
lived
through
ah
which
of
us
to
whom
time
has
not
been
a
torment
of
hell
is
there
no
nether
circle
where
dread
anticipation
eternally
prolongs
itself
eternally
varied
with
hope
in
vain
for
ever
mrs
hood
had
abandoned
her
useless
protests
she
came
and
sat
by
the
girl
no
doubt
he
gone
to
the
walkers
she
kept
saying
naming
acquaintances
with
whom
hood
occasionally
spent
an
evening
then
why
need
you
wait
for
him
my
dear
ca
he
go
up
and
see
you
as
soon
as
he
gets
in
emily
said
at
last
you
go
to
the
walkers
and
ask
it
is
not
really
very
far
will
you
go
but
my
child
it
will
take
me
at
least
an
hour
to
walk
there
and
back
i
should
only
miss
him
on
the
way
are
you
afraid
of
something
i
am
i
believe
something
has
happened
to
him
are
your
fancies
you
are
very
poorly
it
is
cruel
to
me
to
refuse
to
go
to
bed
you
go
mother
if
you
do
not
i
must
ill
or
not
i
must
go
she
started
to
her
feet
her
mother
gazed
at
her
in
fear
believing
it
the
beginning
of
delirium
my
dear
child
she
pleaded
laying
her
hand
on
the
girl
arm
you
come
upstairs
to
please
me
dear
if
you
will
go
i
promise
to
lie
here
quietly
till
you
return
it
is
impossible
to
leave
you
alone
in
the
house
look
now
it
is
nine
in
half
an
hour
an
hour
at
most
your
father
will
be
back
why
you
know
how
often
he
stays
late
when
he
gets
talking
emily
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
then
she
said
you
ask
hopkins
to
send
her
servant
think
the
trouble
it
will
be
giving
you
do
it
i
wish
it
will
you
go
and
ask
her
i
will
give
the
girl
money
you
are
so
determined
of
course
i
will
ask
her
but
i
sure
at
length
she
left
the
room
to
go
out
of
the
house
by
the
and
call
at
the
neighbours
scarcely
was
she
away
when
emily
darted
upstairs
and
in
an
instant
was
down
again
with
her
hat
and
a
cloak
another
moment
and
she
was
out
in
the
road
she
did
not
forget
the
terror
her
mother
would
suffer
on
finding
her
gone
but
endurance
had
reached
its
limit
it
was
growing
dark
after
one
look
in
the
direction
of
dunfield
she
took
the
opposite
way
and
ran
towards
the
heath
ran
till
her
breath
failed
and
she
had
to
drop
into
a
quick
walk
once
more
she
was
going
to
the
upper
heath
and
to
the
house
which
was
the
source
of
all
her
misery
when
she
reached
the
quarry
it
was
quite
dark
at
her
approach
she
saw
the
shape
of
a
man
move
away
into
the
shadow
of
the
quarried
rock
and
an
unreasoning
fear
spurred
her
past
the
spot
five
minutes
more
and
she
was
at
dagworthy
gate
she
rang
the
the
servant
told
her
that
dagworthy
was
at
home
she
declined
to
give
her
name
but
said
she
must
see
him
at
once
speedily
she
was
led
into
a
room
where
her
enemy
sat
alone
he
looked
at
her
wonderingly
then
with
a
deep
flush
for
now
he
surely
had
gained
his
end
he
advanced
towards
her
without
speaking
is
my
father
she
asked
the
voice
which
disabused
him
did
not
seem
emily
he
at
home
has
not
come
home
what
have
you
done
come
home
he
is
free
he
is
safe
my
father
you
have
spared
him
dagworthy
inwardly
cursed
himself
for
shortsightedness
were
he
but
able
to
answer
would
she
not
yield
him
anything
why
had
he
not
made
trial
of
this
policy
or
was
it
now
too
late
but
hoed
had
not
returned
home
the
man
had
gone
forth
from
him
in
despair
as
he
gazed
at
the
girl
a
suspicion
all
but
a
fear
touched
him
why
should
hood
remain
away
from
his
house
she
was
repeating
her
questions
imploringly
is
free
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
emily
have
forgiven
him
oh
you
have
had
that
mercy
upon
us
down
and
let
us
talk
about
it
said
dagworthy
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
that
he
had
taken
her
hand
but
the
next
moment
he
was
holding
her
in
his
arm
and
with
a
cry
she
broke
away
are
others
in
the
house
she
exclaimed
her
wild
fearful
eyes
seeking
other
exit
than
that
which
he
stopped
must
call
for
their
help
can
you
not
see
that
i
am
suffering
ill
are
you
pitiless
but
no
no
for
you
have
spared
him
dagworthy
mastered
himself
though
it
cost
him
something
and
spoke
with
an
effort
at
gentleness
thanks
have
you
to
give
me
emily
life
gratitude
but
that
will
be
your
least
reward
but
how
is
the
gratitude
going
to
be
shown
her
keen
sense
found
a
fear
in
his
manner
of
speaking
have
not
said
a
word
to
him
she
asked
seeming
to
forget
his
question
of
what
ultimate
use
was
it
to
lie
and
she
would
not
suffer
him
within
reach
of
her
could
very
well
help
doing
that
he
replied
unable
to
resolve
how
it
were
best
to
speak
and
uttering
the
first
words
that
came
carelessly
he
knows
you
have
discovered
her
voice
failed
such
explanation
of
her
father
absence
was
a
new
terror
he
knows
dagworthy
answered
cruelty
resuming
its
fascination
could
keep
him
at
the
mill
you
know
though
i
let
him
off
his
punishment
dismissed
him
did
it
not
too
late
to
have
him
back
and
something
better
me
go
she
said
hoarsely
he
moved
from
the
door
sight
of
such
misery
vanquished
even
him
when
she
reached
home
her
mother
was
standing
with
two
or
three
neighbours
in
front
of
the
house
at
the
sight
of
emily
there
were
exclamations
of
relief
and
welcome
child
where
can
you
have
been
mrs
hood
cried
following
the
girl
who
passed
the
without
pausing
father
come
was
the
reply
not
yet
but
where
have
you
been
why
you
were
coming
from
the
heath
emily
in
the
night
air
and
you
so
ill
have
been
to
ask
dagworthy
emily
said
in
a
tired
voice
knows
nothing
of
him
her
strength
bore
her
into
the
parlour
then
she
sank
upon
the
couch
and
closed
her
eyes
mrs
hood
summoned
the
help
of
her
friends
unresisting
with
eyes
still
closed
silent
she
was
carried
upstairs
and
laid
in
her
bed
her
mother
sat
by
her
midnight
came
and
hood
did
not
return
already
mrs
hood
had
begun
to
suspect
something
mysterious
in
emily
anxiety
her
own
fears
now
became
active
she
went
to
the
front
door
and
stood
there
with
impatience
by
turns
angry
and
alarmed
her
husband
had
never
been
so
late
she
returned
to
the
bedroom
are
you
awake
dear
the
girl
eyes
opened
but
she
did
not
speak
you
know
any
reason
why
your
father
should
stay
away
a
slight
shake
of
the
head
was
the
reply
the
deepest
stillness
of
night
was
upon
the
house
as
mrs
hood
seated
herself
with
murmured
bewailing
of
such
wretchedness
there
sounded
a
heavy
crash
out
on
the
staircase
it
was
followed
by
a
peculiar
ringing
reverberation
emily
rose
with
a
shriek
love
hush
hush
said
her
mother
only
the
fallen
how
that
does
shake
my
nerves
it
did
it
only
last
week
and
gave
me
such
a
start
grasping
her
mother
hand
the
girl
lay
back
the
silence
was
deeper
than
before
for
not
even
the
clock
ticked
dagworthy
could
not
sleep
at
sunrise
he
had
wearied
himself
so
with
vain
efforts
to
lie
still
that
he
resolved
to
take
a
turn
across
the
heath
and
then
rest
if
he
felt
able
to
he
rose
and
went
into
the
still
morning
air
the
heath
was
beautiful
seen
thus
in
the
purple
flush
of
the
dawn
he
had
called
forth
a
dog
to
accompany
him
and
the
animal
careered
in
great
circles
over
the
dewy
sward
barking
at
the
birds
it
started
up
leaping
high
from
the
ground
mad
with
the
joy
of
life
he
ran
a
race
with
it
to
the
wall
which
bounded
the
top
of
the
quarry
the
exercise
did
him
good
driving
from
his
mind
shadows
which
had
clung
about
it
in
the
night
beaching
the
wall
he
rested
his
arms
upon
it
and
looked
over
dunfield
to
the
glory
of
the
rising
sun
the
smoke
of
the
thickening
as
fires
were
coaled
for
the
day
work
caught
delicate
reflection
from
the
sky
the
lofty
spire
of
the
church
seemed
built
of
some
beautiful
stone
the
grassy
country
round
about
wore
a
fresher
green
than
it
was
wont
to
show
the
very
river
so
foul
in
reality
with
the
refuse
of
manufactures
gleamed
like
a
pure
current
dagworthy
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
the
horizon
and
grew
wide
with
the
sense
of
things
half
understood
the
dog
had
left
him
and
was
gone
round
into
the
quarry
a
bark
came
from
below
at
a
second
bark
dagworthy
looked
down
the
dog
was
snuffing
at
a
man
who
lay
between
a
big
piece
of
quarried
stone
and
a
little
pool
asleep
was
he
yet
it
was
not
the
attitude
in
which
men
sleep
the
dog
barked
a
third
time
he
left
his
position
and
followed
the
circuit
which
would
bring
him
down
to
where
the
man
lay
whilst
still
a
few
yards
off
he
checked
himself
if
the
man
slept
his
body
was
strangely
distorted
one
arm
seemed
to
be
beneath
him
the
other
was
extended
stiffly
the
face
looked
at
the
sky
a
few
steps
and
dagworthy
gazing
upon
the
face
knew
it
a
cold
shudder
thrilled
him
and
he
drew
back
his
foot
struck
against
something
it
was
a
bottle
he
picked
it
up
and
read
a
word
in
large
print
on
the
white
label
the
temptation
to
look
full
into
the
face
again
was
irresistible
though
horror
shook
him
as
he
approached
the
features
were
hideous
the
eyes
starting
from
their
sockets
the
lips
drawn
back
over
the
teeth
he
turned
and
walked
away
rapidly
followed
by
the
dog
which
roused
the
quarry
echoes
with
its
barking
god
i
never
thought
of
that
the
words
uttered
themselves
as
he
speeded
on
only
at
the
he
stayed
and
then
seemed
to
reflect
upon
what
he
should
do
the
temptation
was
to
return
into
the
house
and
leave
others
to
spread
the
news
there
would
be
workmen
in
the
quarry
in
less
than
an
hour
yet
he
did
not
do
this
but
hurried
past
his
own
door
to
the
house
of
a
doctor
not
a
hundred
yards
away
him
he
called
forth
about
midday
a
covered
burden
was
brought
in
a
cart
to
banbrigg
the
cart
stopped
before
the
hoods
house
and
two
men
lifting
the
burden
carried
it
through
the
gate
and
to
the
door
mrs
hood
had
already
opened
to
them
and
stood
with
her
face
the
burden
was
taken
into
the
parlour
and
placed
upon
the
couch
the
outline
was
that
of
a
man
form
in
the
kitchen
were
two
women
neighbours
as
soon
as
the
men
had
departed
and
the
front
door
was
closed
they
stole
forward
one
sobbing
the
other
pale
with
fear
they
entered
the
and
mrs
hood
went
in
with
them
she
was
strangely
all
three
stood
looking
at
the
wrapped
form
which
was
that
of
a
man
sha
dare
to
look
at
him
mrs
hood
whispered
doctor
told
me
i
was
to
oh
my
husband
with
the
sublime
love
of
woman
conquering
all
dread
she
dropped
to
her
knees
and
laid
her
head
on
the
pillow
of
the
couch
by
the
side
of
that
head
so
closely
shrouded
god
emily
ca
see
this
she
groaned
i
better
go
up
to
her
one
of
the
women
asked
both
of
them
stood
at
a
distance
perhaps
you
had
but
you
be
wanted
at
home
stay
with
me
a
minute
then
i
lock
this
door
and
go
up
myself
at
the
sound
of
a
hand
on
the
door
all
turned
with
a
movement
of
surprise
and
affright
there
entered
emily
hurriedly
dressed
her
hair
loose
upon
her
shoulders
she
looked
round
the
room
with
pitiful
gaze
then
upon
her
mother
then
at
the
form
on
the
couch
she
pointed
to
it
has
come
her
voice
was
unearthly
the
sound
gave
her
mother
strength
to
run
to
her
and
throw
her
arms
about
her
sobbing
she
suffered
herself
to
be
led
upstairs
and
did
not
speak
chapter
xiv
news
and
comments
as
a
man
who
took
the
world
as
he
found
it
and
on
the
whole
found
it
well
worth
accepting
on
such
terms
athel
was
not
likely
to
allow
his
annoyance
with
wilfrid
to
threaten
the
habitual
excellence
of
his
digestion
his
disappointment
was
real
enough
when
of
a
sudden
wilfrid
had
announced
that
he
could
not
accompany
the
family
party
to
switzerland
athel
was
saved
from
undignified
irresolution
by
a
hearty
outburst
of
temper
which
saw
him
well
over
the
straits
before
it
gave
way
to
the
natural
reaction
under
the
influence
of
which
he
called
himself
a
blockhead
he
had
beyond
a
doubt
precipitated
the
marriage
when
postponement
was
the
only
thing
he
really
cared
about
to
abuse
himself
was
one
thing
the
privilege
which
an
englishman
is
ready
enough
to
exercise
to
have
his
thoughts
uttered
to
him
by
his
sister
with
feminine
neatness
and
candour
was
quite
another
matter
rossall
had
in
vain
attempted
to
stem
the
flood
of
wrath
rushing
channelwards
overcome
she
clad
herself
in
meaning
silence
until
her
brother
too
ingenuous
man
was
compelled
to
return
to
the
subject
himself
and
towards
the
end
of
the
journey
rashly
gave
utterance
to
half
a
wish
that
he
had
not
left
young
fool
behind
rossall
herself
a
little
too
impetuous
when
triumph
was
no
longer
doubtful
made
such
pointed
remarks
on
the
neglect
of
good
advice
that
the
ire
which
was
cooling
shot
forth
flame
in
another
direction
brother
and
sister
arrived
at
geneva
in
something
less
than
perfect
amity
their
real
affection
for
each
other
was
quite
capable
of
bearing
not
infrequently
the
strain
of
irritability
on
both
sides
a
day
of
mutual
causticities
had
well
prepared
the
ground
for
the
return
of
good
temper
when
the
arrival
of
wilfrid
by
astonishing
both
hastened
their
complete
reconciliation
wilfrid
was
mysterious
for
a
week
he
kept
his
counsel
and
behaved
as
if
nothing
unusual
had
happened
by
that
time
patience
had
reached
its
limit
he
requested
to
be
told
how
matters
stood
wilfrid
determined
not
to
compromise
his
dignity
by
speaking
first
but
glad
enough
when
his
father
broached
the
topic
related
the
story
of
his
visit
to
dunfield
possibly
he
laid
needless
emphasis
on
emily
unselfish
prudence
fail
to
see
the
striking
meritoriousness
of
all
that
athel
observed
put
into
a
good
humour
by
the
result
and
consequently
allowing
himself
a
little
captiousness
merely
means
that
she
behaved
as
any
woman
who
respected
herself
would
under
the
circumstances
your
own
behaviour
on
the
other
hand
well
let
it
pass
do
see
that
i
could
have
acted
otherwise
said
wilfrid
too
contented
to
care
about
arguing
the
point
of
course
saw
her
parents
wilfrid
had
given
no
detailed
account
of
the
way
in
which
his
interview
with
emily
had
been
obtained
he
mentioned
it
now
his
father
listening
with
the
frowning
smile
of
a
man
who
judges
such
puerilities
from
the
standpoint
of
comfortable
middle
age
the
tone
between
them
returned
before
long
to
the
friendliness
never
previously
interrupted
athel
shortly
wrote
a
letter
to
baxendale
of
dunfield
whom
he
only
knew
by
name
as
beatrice
uncle
and
begged
for
private
information
regarding
emily
family
he
received
a
courteous
reply
the
details
not
of
course
wholly
palatable
but
confirmatory
of
the
modest
hopes
he
had
entertained
this
reply
he
showed
to
his
sister
rossall
raised
her
eyebrows
resignedly
and
returned
the
letter
in
silence
one
expected
i
suppose
said
athel
suppose
so
baxendale
probably
thinks
the
man
has
been
applying
for
a
position
in
your
pantry
i
was
obliged
you
know
to
hint
at
my
reasons
for
seeking
information
did
then
beatrice
knows
all
about
it
by
this
time
as
well
that
way
as
any
other
i
suppose
shall
have
to
take
the
matter
like
reasonable
beings
edith
said
her
brother
a
trifle
annoyed
by
her
failure
to
countenance
him
but
you
seem
anxious
that
i
should
rejoice
that
would
not
be
very
reasonable
something
warned
athel
that
he
had
better
abstain
from
rejoinder
he
pursed
his
lips
and
walked
away
wilfrid
had
not
spoken
of
the
subject
to
his
aunt
since
the
disclosure
at
the
firs
and
rossall
was
offended
by
his
silence
at
least
as
much
as
by
the
prospect
of
his
marrying
miss
hood
clearly
he
regarded
the
matter
as
no
concern
of
hers
whereas
a
woman
claims
by
natural
right
a
share
in
the
matrimonial
projects
of
all
her
male
relatives
with
whom
she
is
on
a
footing
of
intimacy
perhaps
the
main
cause
of
her
displeasure
in
the
first
instance
had
been
the
fact
that
things
should
have
got
to
such
a
pass
without
her
having
as
much
as
suspected
the
imminence
of
danger
she
regarded
emily
as
one
that
had
outwitted
her
dearly
would
she
have
liked
to
be
able
to
meet
her
brother
with
the
assertion
that
she
had
suspected
it
all
along
the
impossibility
of
doing
so
not
from
conscientious
scruples
but
because
in
that
case
it
would
clearly
have
been
her
duty
to
speak
exasperated
her
disappointment
at
the
frustration
of
the
match
she
desired
now
that
she
was
getting
used
to
the
state
of
things
wilfrid
behaviour
to
her
became
the
chief
ground
of
her
offence
it
seemed
to
her
that
at
least
he
owed
some
kind
of
apology
for
the
distress
he
had
naturally
caused
her
in
truth
she
would
have
liked
him
to
undertake
the
task
of
winning
her
over
to
his
side
between
her
and
her
nephew
there
had
never
existed
a
warm
confidence
and
wilfrid
present
attitude
was
too
much
a
confirmation
of
the
feeling
she
had
experienced
now
and
then
that
his
affection
was
qualified
with
just
a
little
contempt
she
was
not
she
knew
a
woman
and
on
that
very
account
cared
more
for
the
special
dominion
of
her
sex
since
wilfrid
had
ceased
to
be
a
hobbledehoy
it
would
have
become
him
to
put
a
little
more
of
the
courtier
into
his
manner
towards
her
for
are
there
not
countries
in
which
their
degree
of
kin
is
no
bar
to
matrimony
rossall
was
of
the
women
who
like
the
flavour
of
respectful
worship
in
all
men
who
are
neither
father
brother
nor
son
wilfrid
had
fallen
short
of
this
and
hence
the
affectation
with
which
she
had
persisted
in
regarding
him
as
a
schoolboy
his
latest
exploits
were
vastly
more
interesting
to
her
than
anything
he
had
done
in
academic
spheres
and
she
suffered
a
sense
of
exclusion
in
seeing
him
so
determined
to
disregard
her
opinion
she
persuaded
him
to
row
her
cut
one
evening
on
a
lake
by
which
they
were
spending
a
few
days
wilfrid
suspecting
that
she
aimed
at
a
proposed
that
his
father
should
accompany
them
rossall
overruled
the
suggestion
wonderfully
you
are
picking
up
she
said
after
watching
him
pull
for
a
few
minutes
you
know
wilf
your
tendency
is
to
stoutness
in
a
few
years
you
will
be
portly
if
you
live
too
sedentary
a
life
he
looked
annoyed
and
by
so
doing
gratified
her
she
proceeded
do
you
think
i
overheard
one
of
our
spectacled
friends
say
this
morning
sie
you
were
walking
at
a
little
distance
haben
sie
das
muster
des
englischen
der
gute
schlichte
wilfrid
had
been
working
up
his
german
he
stopped
rowing
red
with
vexation
is
a
malicious
invention
he
declared
of
the
kind
the
truth
of
the
remark
struck
me
am
obliged
to
you
my
dear
boy
what
is
there
to
be
offended
at
the
man
envied
you
with
all
his
heart
and
it
is
delightful
to
see
you
begin
to
look
so
smooth
about
the
cheeks
am
neither
an
aristocrat
nor
aristocrat
to
the
core
i
never
knew
any
one
so
sensitive
on
points
of
personal
dignity
so
intolerant
of
difference
of
opinion
in
others
so
narrowly
did
you
imagine
yourself
to
have
the
air
of
a
hero
of
romance
of
the
intense
school
wilfrid
looked
into
her
eyes
and
laughed
is
your
way
of
saying
that
you
think
my
recent
behaviour
incongruous
you
wish
to
impress
upon
me
how
absurd
i
look
from
the
outside
is
my
way
of
saying
that
i
am
sorry
for
you
he
laughed
again
the
english
aristocrat
is
an
object
of
your
pity
when
he
gets
into
a
false
position
well
suppose
we
talk
of
something
else
look
at
the
moon
rising
over
that
shoulder
of
the
hill
by
way
of
proving
that
you
are
romantic
no
we
wo
talk
of
something
else
what
news
have
you
from
england
he
replied
regarding
the
gleaming
drops
that
fell
from
his
suspended
oar
you
are
troubled
that
the
post
brings
you
nothing
do
you
know
emotions
are
on
the
surface
he
made
no
reply
rossall
sighed
a
pity
you
are
so
independent
i
often
think
a
man
majority
ought
to
come
ten
years
later
than
it
does
most
of
you
are
mere
boys
till
thirty
at
least
and
you
go
and
do
things
that
you
repent
all
the
rest
of
your
lives
dare
you
promise
to
come
to
me
in
ten
years
and
tell
me
with
complete
frankness
what
you
think
of
a
certain
step
he
smiled
scornfully
let
us
register
the
undertaking
after
pausing
a
moment
he
continued
with
an
outburst
of
vehemence
a
characteristic
of
wilfrid
speech
illustrate
a
thought
i
have
often
had
about
women
the
majority
of
you
at
all
events
as
you
get
into
the
world
have
no
kind
of
faith
in
anything
but
sordid
motives
you
are
cynical
beyond
anything
men
can
pretend
to
you
scoff
at
every
suggestion
of
idealism
i
suppose
it
is
that
which
makes
us
feel
the
conversation
of
most
women
of
refinement
so
intolerably
full
of
hypocrisies
having
cast
away
all
faith
you
can
not
dispense
with
the
show
of
it
the
traditions
of
your
sex
must
be
supported
you
laugh
in
your
sleeves
at
the
very
things
which
are
supposed
to
constitute
your
claims
to
worship
you
are
worldly
to
the
core
men
are
very
quixotes
compared
with
you
even
if
they
put
on
cynicism
for
show
they
are
ashamed
of
it
within
themselves
with
you
fine
feeling
is
the
affectation
i
have
felt
it
again
and
again
explain
it
now
defend
yourself
if
you
can
show
me
that
i
am
wrong
and
i
will
thank
you
heartily
word
what
an
arraignment
cried
rossall
between
amusement
at
his
boldness
and
another
feeling
which
warmed
her
cheeks
a
little
let
us
pass
from
broad
accusation
to
particulars
i
illustrate
all
these
shocking
things
poor
me
how
do
i
illustrate
them
the
whole
of
your
attitude
towards
myself
of
late
you
my
feelings
you
refuse
to
regard
me
as
anything
but
a
donkey
you
prophesy
that
in
a
year
or
two
i
shall
repent
having
made
a
disinterested
marriage
i
observe
the
difference
between
your
point
of
view
and
my
father
the
worst
of
it
is
you
are
sincere
the
circumstances
of
the
case
do
not
call
upon
you
for
an
expression
of
graceful
sentiments
and
you
are
not
ashamed
to
show
me
how
meanly
you
regard
all
that
is
highest
and
purest
in
life
i
explain
it
women
are
very
quick
to
get
at
realities
to
see
below
the
surface
in
conduct
and
profession
we
become
you
say
worldly
as
soon
as
we
get
into
the
world
precisely
because
we
have
to
be
so
wide
awake
to
protect
ourselves
we
instinctively
know
the
difference
between
the
ring
of
false
and
true
and
as
we
hear
the
false
so
much
the
oftener
your
charge
against
us
of
want
of
real
feeling
is
the
result
of
your
ignorance
of
women
you
do
see
below
the
surface
now
apply
all
this
to
the
present
instance
what
has
your
insight
discerned
in
my
proposed
marriage
to
cause
you
to
regard
it
as
a
piece
of
folly
this
you
ally
yourself
with
some
one
from
a
class
beneath
your
own
such
marriages
very
very
seldom
prove
anything
but
miserable
and
bring
a
great
many
troubles
you
will
say
that
miss
hood
is
raised
by
education
above
the
class
in
which
she
was
born
but
no
doubt
she
has
relatives
and
they
ca
be
entirely
got
rid
of
however
that
is
the
point
i
lay
most
stress
on
am
quite
sure
you
will
make
her
miserable
you
are
marrying
too
young
your
character
is
not
fixed
in
a
few
years
before
that
you
will
want
to
get
rid
of
her
that
is
at
all
events
intelligible
and
your
grounds
for
the
belief
are
inconstant
and
you
are
ambitious
you
might
marry
a
woman
from
a
class
higher
than
your
own
and
when
it
is
too
late
you
will
understand
what
you
have
lost
advantages
precisely
how
if
your
keen
appreciation
of
worldly
advantages
results
in
your
wife
unhappiness
deny
the
keen
appreciation
in
your
sense
course
you
do
come
to
me
in
ten
years
and
tell
me
your
opinion
of
women
ways
of
thinking
this
was
the
significant
part
of
their
conversation
wilfrid
came
to
land
confirmed
in
his
views
rossall
with
the
satisfaction
of
having
prophesied
uncomfortable
things
she
had
a
letter
on
the
following
morning
on
which
she
recognised
beatrice
redwing
bend
to
her
surprise
the
stamp
was
of
dunfield
it
proved
that
beatrice
was
on
a
visit
to
the
baxendales
her
mother
prior
to
going
to
the
isle
of
wight
had
decided
to
accept
an
invitation
to
a
house
in
the
midland
counties
which
beatrice
did
not
greatly
care
to
visit
so
the
latter
had
used
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
a
summons
from
her
friends
in
the
north
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
four
years
beatrice
replied
to
a
letter
from
rossall
which
had
been
forwarded
to
her
after
breakfast
rossall
took
her
brother
aside
and
pointed
out
to
him
a
paragraph
in
beatrice
letter
it
ran
thus
very
shocking
thing
has
happened
which
i
suppose
i
may
mention
as
you
will
necessarily
hear
of
it
soon
miss
hood
father
has
committed
suicide
poisoned
himself
he
was
found
dead
on
a
common
just
outside
the
town
nobody
seems
to
know
any
reason
unless
it
was
trouble
of
a
pecuniary
kind
miss
hood
is
seriously
ill
the
baxendales
send
daily
to
make
inquiries
and
i
am
afraid
the
latest
news
is
anything
but
hopeful
she
was
to
have
dined
with
us
here
the
day
after
her
father
death
there
was
no
further
comment
the
writer
went
on
to
speak
of
certain
peculiarities
in
the
mode
of
conducting
service
at
luke
church
athel
read
and
in
his
manner
whistled
low
his
sister
looked
interrogation
suppose
we
shall
have
to
tell
him
said
the
former
he
has
no
means
of
hearing
suppose
we
must
he
has
been
anxious
at
not
receiving
letters
he
expected
do
you
know
had
a
talk
with
him
last
night
so
i
thought
the
deuce
take
it
of
course
he
pack
off
on
the
moment
what
on
earth
can
have
induced
the
man
to
poison
himself
such
a
proceeding
was
so
at
variance
with
athel
views
of
life
that
it
made
him
seriously
uncomfortable
it
suggested
criminality
or
at
least
lunacy
both
such
very
unpleasant
things
to
be
even
remotely
connected
with
poverty
he
could
pardon
but
suicide
was
really
disreputable
from
the
philosophic
resignation
to
which
he
had
attained
he
fell
back
into
petulance
always
easier
to
him
than
grave
protest
deuce
take
it
he
repeated
rossall
pointed
to
the
words
reporting
emily
condition
at
the
time
of
writing
was
more
than
two
days
ago
she
said
meaningly
went
her
brother
you
tell
him
suppose
i
must
yes
it
is
hardly
allowable
even
to
postpone
it
where
is
he
wilfrid
was
found
in
the
hotel
garden
aunt
has
had
a
letter
from
beatrice
athel
began
with
the
awkwardness
of
a
comfortable
englishman
called
upon
to
break
bad
news
is
staying
in
dunfield
something
in
the
letter
you
ought
to
know
wilfrid
looked
anxiously
appears
that
miss
hood
father
has
do
let
it
be
a
shock
to
you
has
just
died
and
died
in
fact
by
his
own
hands
killed
himself
wilfrid
exclaimed
turning
pale
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
is
the
report
miss
hood
is
naturally
suffering
from
from
the
shocking
occurrence
is
ill
wilfrid
asked
when
he
had
examined
his
father
face
for
a
moment
i
am
afraid
she
is
beatrice
gives
no
details
are
not
keeping
anything
from
me
nothing
the
words
are
that
she
is
ill
and
it
is
feared
seriously
must
go
at
once
it
was
said
with
quiet
decision
wilfrid
consulted
his
watch
and
walked
rapidly
to
the
hotel
he
had
to
wait
a
couple
of
hours
however
before
he
could
start
on
his
journey
and
he
spent
the
time
by
himself
his
father
felt
he
could
be
of
no
use
and
rossall
found
a
difficulty
in
approaching
her
nephew
under
such
circumstances
will
telegraph
athel
said
at
the
station
by
way
of
expressing
himself
sympathetically
the
train
moved
away
and
the
long
miserable
hours
of
travelling
had
to
be
lived
through
wilfrid
thoughts
were
all
the
more
anxious
from
his
ignorance
of
the
dead
man
position
and
history
even
yet
emily
had
said
very
little
of
her
parents
in
writing
to
him
he
imagined
all
manner
of
wretched
things
to
connect
her
silence
with
this
catastrophe
his
fears
on
her
own
account
were
not
excessive
the
state
of
vigorous
health
into
which
he
had
grown
during
late
weeks
perhaps
helped
him
to
avoid
thoughts
of
a
desperate
kind
it
was
bad
enough
that
she
lay
ill
and
from
such
a
cause
he
feared
nothing
worse
than
illness
but
his
uneasiness
increased
as
time
went
on
the
travelling
seemed
intolerably
tardy
he
had
to
decide
what
his
course
would
be
on
reaching
dunfield
and
decision
was
not
easy
to
go
straight
to
the
house
might
result
in
painful
embarrassments
it
would
at
all
events
be
better
first
to
make
inquiries
elsewhere
could
he
have
recourse
to
beatrice
at
first
the
suggestion
did
not
recommend
itself
but
nothing
better
came
into
his
mind
and
as
his
impatience
grew
the
obstacles
seemed
so
trifling
that
he
overlooked
them
he
remembered
that
the
address
of
the
baxendales
was
unknown
to
him
but
it
could
easily
be
discovered
yes
he
would
go
straight
to
beatrice
reaching
london
at
ten
in
the
morning
he
drove
directly
to
king
cross
and
pursued
his
journey
northwards
though
worn
with
fatigue
excitement
would
not
allow
him
more
than
a
snatch
of
sleep
now
and
then
when
at
length
he
stepped
out
at
dunfield
he
was
in
sorry
plight
he
went
to
an
hotel
refreshed
himself
as
well
as
he
could
and
made
inquiry
about
the
baxendales
address
at
four
he
presented
himself
at
the
house
and
sent
in
a
card
to
beatrice
the
baxendales
lived
in
luke
which
we
already
know
as
the
fashionable
quarter
of
dunfield
their
house
stood
by
itself
with
high
walls
about
it
enclosing
a
garden
at
the
door
were
stone
pillars
the
lower
half
painted
a
dull
red
it
seemed
the
abode
of
solid
people
not
troubled
with
scruples
of
taste
it
was
with
surprise
that
wilfrid
found
himself
in
a
room
abundantly
supplied
with
books
and
furnished
in
library
fashion
his
state
of
mind
notwithstanding
he
glanced
along
a
few
shelves
discovering
yet
more
unexpected
things
to
wit
philosophical
works
unfortunately
the
corners
of
the
room
showed
busts
of
certain
modern
english
statesmen
but
one
looks
for
weaknesses
everywhere
beatrice
entered
rustling
in
a
light
shimmery
dress
her
face
expressed
embarrassment
rather
than
surprise
after
the
first
exchange
of
glances
she
avoided
his
eager
look
her
hand
had
lain
but
coldly
in
his
wilfrid
face
to
face
with
her
found
more
difficulty
in
speaking
than
he
had
anticipated
have
come
directly
from
switzerland
he
began
mentioned
in
a
letter
to
my
aunt
that
his
hesitation
of
a
moment
was
relieved
by
beatrice
mean
miss
hood
illness
she
said
looking
down
at
her
hands
which
were
lightly
clasped
on
her
lap
i
wish
for
news
i
thought
it
likely
you
might
know
probably
it
was
the
effect
of
his
weariness
he
could
not
speak
in
his
usual
straightforward
way
hesitancy
to
his
own
annoyance
made
gaps
and
pauses
in
his
sentences
heard
this
morning
beatrice
said
looking
past
his
face
to
the
window
she
is
better
the
danger
seems
to
be
over
has
been
danger
day
before
yesterday
she
was
given
up
ill
as
that
wilfrid
spoke
half
to
himself
and
indeed
it
cost
him
an
effort
to
make
his
voice
louder
he
began
you
tell
me
and
again
paused
you
heard
nothing
from
any
other
quarter
beatrice
asked
after
a
silence
of
almost
a
minute
he
looked
at
her
wondering
what
she
knew
of
his
relations
to
emily
it
was
clear
that
his
interest
occasioned
her
no
surprise
came
away
immediately
on
hearing
what
your
letter
contained
there
is
no
one
else
with
whom
i
could
communicate
i
hesitated
to
go
to
the
house
not
knowing
will
you
tell
me
what
you
know
of
this
horrible
event
beatrice
stroked
one
hand
with
the
other
and
seemed
to
constrain
herself
to
lock
up
and
to
speak
myself
know
nothing
but
the
fact
of
mr
hood
death
it
took
place
some
ten
days
ago
on
monday
of
last
week
i
arrived
here
on
the
wednesday
course
there
was
an
inquest
with
what
results
beyond
the
verdict
of
suicide
no
definite
cause
could
be
discovered
it
is
said
that
he
suffered
from
very
narrow
means
his
body
was
found
by
mr
dagworthy
is
mr
dagworthy
thought
you
probably
knew
returned
beatrice
glancing
quickly
at
him
was
employed
by
dagworthy
as
clerk
in
a
manufactory
he
had
just
left
for
his
summer
holiday
evidence
did
his
employer
give
only
stated
that
mr
hood
had
been
perfectly
regular
and
satisfactory
at
his
work
in
truth
it
is
a
mystery
baxendale
thinks
that
there
had
been
a
long
struggle
with
poverty
quite
enough
to
account
for
the
end
wilfrid
sat
in
gloomy
silence
he
was
picturing
what
emily
must
have
endured
and
reproaching
himself
for
not
having
claimed
a
right
to
her
entire
confidence
when
it
was
in
his
power
to
make
that
hard
path
smooth
and
to
avert
this
fearful
misery
looking
up
at
length
he
met
the
girl
eyes
need
not
explain
myself
to
you
beatrice
he
said
finding
at
last
a
natural
tone
and
calling
her
by
her
christian
name
because
he
had
much
need
of
friendly
sympathy
appear
to
know
why
i
have
come
she
answered
rather
hurriedly
should
not
have
known
but
for
something
that
baxendale
told
me
athel
wrote
a
short
time
ago
to
ask
for
information
about
them
about
the
hoods
wrote
wilfrid
heard
it
with
a
little
surprise
but
without
concern
you
know
whether
mrs
hood
is
alone
with
her
he
went
on
to
ask
believe
so
she
is
better
he
added
quickly
she
proper
attendance
have
any
friends
been
of
aid
baxendales
have
shown
much
kindness
my
aunt
saw
her
yesterday
it
be
long
before
she
is
able
to
leave
her
room
do
you
know
am
not
able
to
say
baxendale
hopes
you
will
go
upstairs
and
see
her
she
can
tell
you
more
will
you
go
is
she
alone
i
ca
talk
with
people
she
is
alone
quite
he
rose
the
girl
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
him
again
and
she
said
look
dreadfully
tired
have
not
slept
i
think
since
i
left
thun
left
them
all
well
beatrice
asked
with
a
change
in
her
voice
from
anxious
interest
which
would
have
veiled
itself
to
the
tone
of
one
discharging
a
formal
politeness
wilfrid
replied
with
a
brief
affirmative
and
they
ascended
the
stairs
together
to
a
large
and
rather
dim
with
a
scent
of
earth
and
vegetation
arising
from
the
great
number
of
growing
plants
arranged
about
it
beatrice
presented
her
friend
to
baxendale
and
at
once
withdrew
the
lady
with
whom
wilfrid
found
himself
talking
was
tall
and
finely
made
not
very
graceful
in
her
bearing
and
with
a
large
face
the
singular
kindness
of
which
speedily
overcame
the
first
sense
of
dissatisfaction
at
its
plainness
she
wore
a
little
cap
of
lace
and
from
her
matronly
costume
breathed
a
pleasant
freshness
akin
to
the
activity
of
her
flame
having
taken
the
young
man
hand
at
greeting
she
held
it
in
both
her
own
and
with
large
grey
eyes
examined
his
face
shrewdly
yet
neither
the
action
nor
the
gaze
was
embarrassing
to
wilfrid
he
felt
on
the
contrary
something
wonderfully
soothing
in
the
pressure
of
the
warm
firm
hands
and
in
her
look
an
invitation
to
the
repose
of
confidence
which
was
new
in
his
experience
of
women
an
experience
not
extensive
by
the
bye
though
his
characteristic
generalisations
seemed
to
claim
the
opposite
he
submitted
from
the
first
moment
to
an
influence
maternal
in
its
spirit
an
influence
which
his
life
had
lacked
and
which
can
perhaps
only
be
fully
appreciated
either
in
mature
reflection
upon
a
past
made
sacred
by
death
or
on
a
meeting
such
as
this
when
the
heart
is
open
to
the
helpfulness
of
disinterested
sympathy
baxendale
countenance
was
grave
enough
to
suit
the
sad
thoughts
with
which
she
sought
to
commune
yet
showed
an
suggesting
the
consolation
held
in
store
by
one
much
at
home
in
the
world
sorrows
as
she
smiled
each
of
her
cheeks
dimpled
softly
and
wilfrid
could
not
help
noticing
the
marvellous
purity
of
her
complexion
as
well
as
the
excellent
white
teeth
just
visible
between
her
lips
you
have
come
all
the
way
from
switzerland
she
said
leading
him
to
a
chair
and
seating
herself
by
him
her
voice
had
a
touch
of
masculine
quality
even
as
her
shape
and
features
but
it
chained
attention
and
impressed
as
the
utterance
of
a
large
and
strong
nature
are
tired
too
with
travel
i
can
see
that
when
did
you
reach
dunfield
an
hour
ago
you
came
here
at
once
beatrice
and
i
were
on
the
point
of
going
to
hebsworth
this
afternoon
i
rejoice
that
we
did
not
i
continually
afraid
lest
she
should
find
the
house
dull
my
husband
and
myself
are
alone
my
eldest
girl
was
married
three
months
ago
my
younger
one
is
just
gone
to
germany
and
my
son
is
spending
half
a
year
in
the
united
states
the
mother
finds
herself
a
little
forsaken
it
was
really
more
than
kind
of
beatrice
to
come
and
bury
herself
with
me
for
a
week
or
two
she
passed
by
tactful
transition
to
the
matter
in
hand
it
a
strange
link
that
she
should
meet
miss
hood
at
your
house
she
has
been
so
saddened
i
never
yet
knew
any
one
who
could
talk
with
emily
without
feeling
deep
interest
in
her
my
daughter
louisa
i
am
convinced
will
never
forget
what
she
owes
to
her
teacher
she
and
my
youngest
child
used
to
be
miss
hood
pupils
perhaps
you
have
heard
my
own
emily
she
is
dead
was
passionately
fond
of
her
namesake
she
talked
of
her
among
the
last
words
she
ever
spoke
poor
little
mite
redwing
tells
me
you
saw
her
yesterday
wilfrid
said
for
the
first
time
she
conscious
but
i
was
afraid
to
talk
to
her
more
than
a
minute
or
two
even
that
excited
her
too
much
i
fear
you
must
not
let
her
know
yet
of
your
presence
am
glad
i
knew
nothing
of
this
till
the
worst
was
over
from
the
way
in
which
she
spoke
of
her
father
i
should
have
feared
horrible
things
did
you
know
him
with
any
intimacy
slightly
i
am
sorry
to
say
the
poor
man
seems
to
have
had
a
very
hard
life
it
is
clear
to
me
that
sheer
difficulty
in
making
ends
meet
drove
him
out
of
his
senses
are
you
a
student
of
political
economy
she
asked
suddenly
looking
into
wilfrid
face
with
a
peculiar
smile
am
not
why
do
you
ask
is
the
one
subject
on
which
my
husband
and
i
hold
no
truce
baxendale
makes
it
one
of
his
pet
studies
whilst
i
should
like
to
make
a
bonfire
of
every
volume
containing
such
cruel
nonsense
you
must
know
athel
that
i
have
an
evil
reputation
in
dunfield
my
views
are
held
dangerous
they
call
me
a
socialist
baxendale
when
particularly
angry
offers
to
hire
the
hall
in
the
corn
exchange
that
i
may
say
my
say
and
henceforth
spare
him
at
home
now
think
of
this
poor
man
he
had
a
clerkship
in
a
mill
and
received
a
salary
of
disgraceful
smallness
he
never
knew
what
it
was
to
be
free
of
anxiety
the
laws
of
political
economy
will
have
it
so
says
my
husband
if
mr
hood
refused
there
were
fifty
other
men
ready
to
take
the
place
he
could
have
lived
at
all
it
seems
but
that
he
owned
a
house
in
another
town
which
brought
him
a
few
pounds
a
year
i
ca
talk
of
such
things
with
patience
here
my
husband
offering
himself
as
a
liberal
candidate
for
dunfield
at
the
election
coming
on
i
say
to
him
what
are
you
going
to
do
if
you
get
into
parliament
are
you
going
to
talk
political
economy
and
make
believe
that
everything
is
right
when
it
as
wrong
as
can
be
if
so
i
say
you
better
save
your
money
for
other
purposes
and
stay
where
you
are
he
tells
me
my
views
are
impracticable
then
i
say
so
much
the
worse
for
the
world
and
so
much
the
more
shame
for
every
rich
man
who
finds
excuses
for
such
a
state
of
things
it
is
dreadful
to
think
of
what
those
poor
people
must
have
gone
through
they
were
so
perfectly
quiet
under
it
that
no
one
gave
a
thought
to
their
position
when
emily
used
to
come
here
day
after
day
i
often
suspected
she
did
have
enough
to
eat
yet
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
ask
questions
it
would
have
been
called
prying
into
things
that
did
concern
me
has
told
me
for
how
much
kindness
she
is
indebted
to
you
wilfrid
said
with
gratitude
what
could
i
do
oh
do
we
live
absurdly
artificial
lives
now
why
should
a
family
who
through
no
fault
of
their
own
are
in
the
most
wretched
straits
shut
themselves
up
and
hide
it
like
a
disgrace
you
think
we
hold
a
great
many
very
nonsensical
ideas
about
and
independence
and
so
on
if
i
were
in
want
i
know
two
or
three
people
to
whom
i
should
forthwith
go
and
ask
for
succour
if
they
thought
the
worse
of
me
for
it
i
should
tell
them
they
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
themselves
we
act
indeed
as
if
we
ourselves
had
made
the
world
and
were
bound
to
pretend
it
an
admirable
piece
of
work
without
a
screw
loose
anywhere
i
always
say
the
world
about
as
bad
a
place
as
one
could
well
imagine
at
all
events
for
most
people
who
live
in
it
and
that
it
our
plain
duty
to
help
each
other
without
grimacings
the
death
of
this
poor
man
has
distressed
me
more
than
i
can
tell
you
it
does
seem
such
a
monstrously
cruel
thing
there
his
employer
a
man
called
dagworthy
who
never
knew
what
it
was
to
be
without
luxuries
i
not
in
the
habit
of
listening
to
scandal
but
i
believe
there
a
great
deal
of
truth
in
certain
stories
told
about
his
selfishness
and
want
of
feeling
i
consider
dagworthy
this
poor
man
murderer
it
was
his
bounden
duty
to
see
that
a
man
in
his
employment
was
paid
enough
to
live
upon
and
mr
hood
was
not
imagine
what
suffering
must
have
brought
about
such
an
end
as
this
a
sad
case
say
people
i
call
it
a
case
of
crime
that
enjoys
impunity
wilfrid
listened
gloomily
the
broad
question
stirred
him
to
no
strong
feeling
but
the
more
he
heard
the
more
passionate
was
his
longing
to
bear
emily
away
from
the
scenes
of
such
a
past
with
what
devotion
would
he
mould
his
life
to
the
one
task
of
healing
her
memory
yet
he
knew
it
must
be
very
long
before
her
heart
could
recover
from
the
all
but
deadly
wound
it
had
received
a
feeling
which
one
may
not
call
jealousy
that
were
too
inhuman
but
still
one
of
the
million
forms
which
jealousy
assumes
to
torture
us
drove
him
to
ask
himself
what
the
effect
of
such
a
crisis
in
her
life
might
be
on
emily
love
for
him
there
would
always
remain
in
her
inmost
soul
one
profound
sadness
in
which
he
had
no
part
and
which
by
its
existence
would
impugn
the
supremacy
of
that
bond
which
united
him
and
her
does
mrs
hood
bear
it
he
asked
when
he
found
baxendale
again
examining
his
face
think
emily
illness
has
been
her
great
help
poor
creatures
that
we
are
needing
one
great
grief
to
balance
another
but
she
seems
in
a
very
weak
state
i
did
like
her
look
yesterday
you
describe
her
to
me
asked
wilfrid
is
not
the
kind
of
mother
you
would
give
to
emily
i
afraid
her
miserable
life
has
told
upon
her
greatly
both
in
mind
and
body
never
spoke
of
her
though
so
often
of
her
father
is
what
i
should
have
expected
still
you
must
not
think
her
quite
unworthy
she
speaks
as
an
educated
woman
and
is
certainly
very
devoted
of
her
present
position
she
must
be
in
extreme
difficulties
she
wants
nothing
for
the
present
friends
have
been
very
anxious
to
help
her
that
what
i
say
only
let
your
misery
drive
you
out
of
the
world
and
people
will
find
out
all
at
once
how
very
easily
they
might
have
saved
you
a
hundredth
part
of
the
interest
that
has
been
shown
in
the
family
since
poor
mr
hood
death
would
have
found
endless
ways
of
making
his
life
very
different
all
sorts
of
people
have
suddenly
discovered
that
he
really
was
a
very
deserving
man
and
that
something
ought
long
since
to
have
been
done
for
him
i
do
know
what
has
been
told
you
of
his
history
he
was
once
in
independent
business
i
do
know
exactly
what
it
was
only
utter
failure
that
drove
him
to
the
miserable
clerkship
how
admirable
it
was
of
a
man
in
such
circumstances
to
have
his
daughter
so
well
educated
wilfrid
smiled
he
said
with
gentle
fervour
have
found
her
own
way
do
depreciate
his
care
baxendale
urged
find
out
by
degrees
what
a
great
deal
of
heathen
doubt
there
is
in
me
among
other
things
i
am
impressed
by
the
power
of
circumstances
emily
would
always
have
been
a
remarkable
girl
no
doubt
but
without
her
education
you
and
i
should
not
have
been
talking
about
her
like
this
even
if
we
had
known
her
we
ca
dispense
with
these
aids
where
i
feel
the
cruelty
of
depriving
people
of
chances
men
and
women
go
to
their
graves
in
wretchedness
who
might
have
done
noble
things
with
an
extra
pound
a
week
to
live
upon
it
does
not
sound
lofty
doctrine
does
it
but
i
have
vast
faith
in
the
extra
pound
a
week
emily
had
the
advantage
of
it
however
it
was
managed
i
do
like
to
think
of
her
as
she
might
have
been
without
it
what
was
it
beatrice
called
me
yesterday
a
materialist
yes
a
materialist
it
was
a
reproach
though
she
said
it
in
the
kindest
way
i
took
it
as
a
compliment
we
ca
get
out
of
the
world
of
material
how
long
will
the
mind
support
itself
on
an
insufficient
supply
of
dry
bread
wilfrid
intellectual
sympathies
were
being
aroused
by
his
new
original
way
of
talking
he
began
to
feel
a
keen
satisfaction
at
having
her
near
him
in
these
troubles
you
think
he
asked
returning
to
his
immediate
needs
i
might
write
to
her
yet
you
must
think
of
it
yet
mrs
hood
he
hesitated
you
think
emily
has
told
her
mother
has
spoken
to
her
of
me
baxendale
looked
surprised
ca
say
i
took
it
for
granted
wonder
why
she
was
reluctant
to
do
so
wilfrid
said
already
speaking
with
complete
freedom
father
can
not
have
known
it
would
have
relieved
his
worst
anxieties
he
would
surely
never
have
been
driven
to
such
things
i
think
not
the
poor
girl
will
feel
that
i
fear
i
suppose
one
can
get
a
glimpse
of
her
reasons
for
keeping
silence
she
gave
wilfrid
a
friendly
glance
as
she
spoke
glad
i
am
he
exclaimed
be
able
to
talk
to
you
i
should
have
been
in
the
utmost
difficulties
think
of
my
position
if
i
had
been
without
a
friend
in
the
town
then
indeed
but
for
miss
redwing
i
should
have
heard
nothing
even
yet
wrote
to
you
to
me
she
mentioned
the
matter
in
a
letter
to
my
aunt
mrs
rossall
beatrice
you
let
me
question
did
she
know
she
says
in
consequence
of
a
letter
my
father
addressed
to
mr
baxendale
the
lady
smiled
again
ask
because
beatrice
is
now
and
then
a
little
mysterious
to
me
i
spoke
to
her
of
that
letter
in
the
full
belief
that
she
must
have
knowledge
of
the
circumstances
she
denied
it
yet
i
thought
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
conscience
to
do
so
think
it
more
than
likely
that
my
aunt
had
written
to
her
on
the
subject
and
yet
no
she
would
not
have
denied
it
to
you
that
would
be
unlike
her
i
think
it
would
baxendale
mused
before
she
spoke
again
a
servant
entered
the
room
with
tea
will
be
glad
of
a
cup
i
am
sure
said
the
lady
now
what
do
you
propose
to
do
shall
you
return
to
london
no
i
shall
stay
in
dunfield
till
i
am
able
to
see
her
well
in
that
case
you
will
not
refuse
our
hospitality
the
longer
you
stay
the
better
pleased
i
shall
be
she
would
hear
of
no
difficulties
would
ask
you
she
said
i
were
not
able
to
promise
you
any
degree
of
privacy
you
like
a
is
at
your
disposal
begging
to
be
occupied
since
my
boy
charlie
went
away
my
husband
is
over
head
and
ears
in
electioneering
business
foolish
man
and
i
ca
tell
you
how
i
feel
the
need
of
someone
to
talk
to
on
other
subjects
than
the
manufacture
of
votes
where
is
your
luggage
wilfrid
named
the
hotel
shall
be
fetched
and
now
i
ask
my
niece
to
come
and
pour
out
tea
for
us
with
the
entrance
of
beatrice
the
conversation
naturally
took
a
different
turn
she
heard
with
becoming
interest
of
establishment
as
a
guest
and
after
a
little
talk
of
rossall
and
the
twins
led
to
the
subject
of
certain
meetings
then
being
held
in
dunfield
an
occasion
of
welcome
excitement
to
such
of
the
inhabitants
as
could
not
absorb
themselves
in
politics
baxendale
seemed
to
regard
the
religious
movement
dispassionately
and
related
a
story
she
had
from
her
husband
of
a
certain
prominent
townsman
driven
to
such
a
pass
by
his
wife
perpetual
absence
from
home
on
revivalist
expeditions
that
he
at
length
fairly
turned
the
key
on
her
in
her
bedroom
and
through
the
keyhole
bade
her
stay
there
till
she
had
remembered
her
domestic
duties
he
was
that
night
publicly
prayed
for
at
a
great
meeting
in
the
corn
exchange
as
one
who
not
content
with
losing
his
own
soul
did
his
best
to
hold
back
others
from
the
way
of
grace
beatrice
affected
to
pay
no
heed
to
this
anecdote
is
your
side
in
politics
she
asked
wilfrid
we
are
all
either
blues
or
yellows
do
they
represent
wilfrid
inquired
you
should
ask
that
said
baxendale
is
yellow
and
blue
blue
nothing
else
in
the
world
i
think
it
an
excellent
idea
to
use
colours
liberal
and
conservative
suggest
ideas
names
therefore
quite
out
of
place
in
dunfield
politics
or
any
other
politics
i
dare
say
if
the
truth
were
known
my
husband
is
a
yellow
it
pleases
him
to
call
himself
a
liberal
or
else
a
radical
he
may
have
been
a
few
months
ago
now
he
a
mere
yellow
i
tell
him
he
in
serious
danger
of
depriving
himself
of
two
joys
in
another
month
a
cloudless
sky
and
the
open
sea
will
he
detestable
to
him
what
are
you
mr
athel
beatrice
asked
liberal
or
a
conservative
i
should
really
find
it
hard
to
guess
a
yellow
house
he
replied
am
certainly
yellow
is
far
from
being
so
complaisant
said
baxendale
detests
our
advanced
views
i
know
nothing
of
them
the
girl
replied
the
quiet
air
with
which
she
expressed
her
indifference
evinced
a
measure
of
spiritual
pride
rather
in
excess
of
that
she
was
wont
to
show
indeed
her
manner
throughout
the
conversation
was
a
little
distant
to
both
her
companions
if
she
jested
with
wilfrid
it
was
with
the
idleness
of
one
condescending
to
subjects
below
the
plane
of
her
interests
to
her
aunt
she
was
rather
courteous
than
affectionate
whilst
they
still
sat
over
tea
baxendale
came
in
like
his
wife
he
was
of
liberal
proportions
and
he
had
a
face
full
of
practical
sagacity
if
anything
he
looked
too
wide
awake
a
fault
of
shrewd
men
constitutionally
active
whose
imagination
plays
little
part
in
their
lives
he
wore
an
open
with
much
expanse
of
the
fore
part
of
his
head
was
bald
and
the
hair
on
each
side
was
brushed
forward
over
his
ears
in
a
manner
which
gave
him
a
singular
appearance
his
bearing
was
lacking
in
each
of
his
remarks
was
followed
by
a
short
laugh
deprecatory
apologetic
it
seemed
impossible
to
him
to
remain
in
a
state
of
bodily
repose
even
with
a
cup
of
tea
in
his
hand
he
paced
the
room
constantly
he
consulted
his
watch
not
that
he
had
any
special
concern
with
the
hour
but
from
a
mere
habit
of
nervousness
he
welcomed
the
visitor
with
warmth
at
the
same
time
obviously
suppressing
a
smile
of
other
than
merely
polite
significance
then
he
began
at
once
to
speak
of
electioneering
matters
and
did
so
pacing
the
carpet
for
the
next
half
hour
wilfrid
listened
with
such
show
of
interest
as
he
could
command
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
and
weariness
was
beginning
to
oppress
him
shortly
after
dinner
fatigue
passed
the
point
at
which
it
could
be
struggled
against
long
waking
the
harassment
of
fears
at
length
consoled
and
the
exhaustion
consequent
upon
his
journey
besieged
him
with
invincible
drowsiness
baxendale
observing
it
begged
him
to
discard
ceremony
and
go
to
rest
gladly
he
suffered
himself
to
be
led
to
his
room
once
there
he
could
not
note
the
objects
about
him
the
very
effort
of
taking
off
his
clothes
was
almost
beyond
his
strength
sleep
was
binding
his
brows
with
oblivion
and
relaxing
every
joint
his
dearest
concerns
were
nothing
to
him
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
he
would
have
resigned
an
eternity
of
love
cry
to
him
horrors
and
his
eyelids
would
make
no
sign
the
moulded
itself
to
his
limbs
the
pillows
pressed
a
yielding
coolness
to
his
cheek
his
senses
failed
amid
faint

odours
blessed
state
how
enviable
above
all
waking
joys
the
impotence
which
makes
us
lords
of
darkness
the
silence
which
suffers
not
to
reach
our
ears
so
much
as
an
echo
of
the

chapter

baxendale
quests
a
servant
went
to
banbrigg
each
morning
for
tidings
emily
so
the
report
said
moved
steadily
towards
recovery
on
the
second
day
after
wilfrid
arrival
baxendale
took
him
with
her
in
the
brougham
and
let
him
wait
for
her
whilst
she
made
a
call
upon
mrs
hood
wilfrid
saw
an
upper
window
of
which
the
blind
was
down
against
the
sun
and
would
gladly
have
lingered
within
sight
of
it
beatrice
had
excused
herself
from
accompanying
the
two
believe
baxendale
said
on
the
way
has
gone
to
some
special
service
at
st
luke
she
was
mistaken
though
beatrice
had
in
truth
been
diligent
at
such
services
of
late
there
she
added
a
kind
of
infatuation
i
find
it
difficult
even
to
understand
how
can
a
girl
of
her
sense
and
education
waste
her
time
in
that
way
think
i
have
no
religious
belief
athel
i
not
enough
for
that
but
this
deliberate
working
of
oneself
into
a
state
of
nervous
excitement
seems
to
me
to
speak
plainly
indecent
wardle
with
whom
i
chat
rather
wickedly
now
and
then
tells
me
the
revivals
are
quite
a
windfall
subsequently
to
him
and
his
brethren
and
do
you
know
i
begin
to
see
bad
results
even
in
my
niece
i
certainly
have
had
her
down
just
at
this
time
if
i
had
suspected
her
leanings
that
way
did
you
notice
how
absent
she
was
last
night
and
again
at
breakfast
this
morning
all
revival
i
assure
you
the
want
of
a
serious
interest
in
life
remarked
wilfrid
remembering
with
a
smile
a
certain
conversation
between
beatrice
and
himself
it
so
inconsistent
continued
the
lady
you
wo
abuse
my
confidence
a
more
worldly
girl
i
never
knew
in
her
heart
i
am
convinced
she
thinks
nothing
so
important
as
the
doings
of
fashionable
society
she
asked
me
the
first
day
she
was
here
how
i
lived
without
what
was
it
i
quite
forget
but
some
paper
or
other
which
is
full
of
what
they
call
fashionable
intelligence
my
dear
i
said
i
know
none
of
those
people
and
care
not
one
grain
of
salt
about
their
flutterings
hither
and
thither
their
marryings
and
givings
ill
marriage
their
dresses
and
their
never
mind
what
and
what
do
you
think
she
answered
but
you
will
care
when
my
name
begins
to
be
mentioned
and
she
went
off
with
just
so
much
toss
of
the
head
you
know
how
beatrice
does
it
well
i
suppose
she
really
does
to
me
an
honour
by
coming
down
to
my
poor
dull
house
no
doubt
she
very
brilliant
in
the
world
i
know
nothing
about
i
suppose
you
have
seen
her
at
her
best
she
wo
waste
her
graces
upon
me
wise
girl
only
the
you
know
the
movement
when
i
shown
my
ignorance
now
and
then
did
you
ever
dance
with
her
yes
frequently
should
like
to
see
her
in
a
certainly
there
are
few
girls
more
handsome
i
suppose
that
is
admitted
she
queens
it
everywhere
her
singing
is
lovely
do
you
know
a
thought
i
often
have
when
i
hear
her
singing
it
seems
to
me
as
if
she
were
not
quite
the
same
person
as
at
other
times
she
affects
me
i
ca
quite
tell
you
how
it
a
sort
of
disenchantment
to
talk
to
her
immediately
afterwards
wilfrid
liked
baxendale
the
more
the
more
he
talked
with
her
in
a
day
or
two
the
confidence
between
them
was
as
complete
as
if
their
acquaintance
had
been
with
her
husband
too
he
came
to
be
on
an
excellent
footing
baxendale
got
him
into
the
library
when
the
ladies
retired
for
the
night
and
expatiated
for
hours
on
the
details
of
his
electoral
campaign
at
first
wilfrid
found
the
subject
tedious
but
the
energy
and
bright
intelligence
of
the
man
ended
by
stirring
his
interest
in
a
remarkable
way
it
was
new
to
wilfrid
to
be
in
converse
with
such
a
strenuously
practical
mind
the
element
of
ambition
in
him
of
less
noble
ambition
which
had
had
its
share
in
urging
him
to
academic
triumphs
was
moved
by
sympathetic
touches
he
came
to
understand
the
enthusiasm
which
possessed
the
liberal
candidate
began
to
be
concerned
for
his
success
to
feel
the
stirrings
of
party
spirit
he
aided
baxendale
in
drawing
up
certain
addresses
for
circulation
and
learned
the
difference
between
literary
elegance
and
the
tact
which
gets
at
the
ear
of
the
multitude
a
vulgar
man
could
not
have
moved
him
in
this
way
and
baxendale
was
in
truth
anything
but
vulgar
through
his
life
he
had
been
on
a
small
scale
a
ruler
of
men
and
had
ruled
with
conspicuous
success
yet
he
had
preserved
a
native
sincerity
and
wrought
under
the
guidance
of
an
ideal
like
all
men
who
are
worth
anything
either
in
public
or
private
he
possessed
a
keen
sense
of
humour
and
was
too
awake
to
the
ludicrous
aspects
of
charlatanry
to
fall
into
the
pits
it
offered
on
every
band
his
misfortune
was
the
difficulty
with
which
he
uttered
himself
even
when
he
got
over
his
nervousness
words
came
to
him
only
in
a
fashion
he
sputtered
and
fumed
and
beat
his
forehead
for
phrases
then
ended
with
a
hearty
laugh
at
his
own
inarticulateness
something
like
this
was
his
talk
in
the
library
of
nights
a
man
called
rapley
an
dealer
fellow
i
ca
get
hold
of
he
hanging
midway
what
do
you
call
it
trimming
with
an
eye
to
the
best
bargain
invaluable
if
only
i
could
get
him
but
a
scoundrel
wants
pay
you
know
do
anything
for
pay
win
the
election
for
me
without
a
doubt
if
only
i
pay
him
every
blackguard
in
dunfield
hand
and
glove
with
him
now
pay
i
wo
yet
i
bound
to
get
that
man
talked
to
him
yesterday
for
two
hours
and
minutes
by
the
parish
church
clock
just
over
his
shop
i
mean
the
clock
is
the
fellow
has
a
conviction
yet
he
can
talk
you
blue
if
i
had
his
powers
of
speech
there
it
is
i
fail
you
see
i
have
to
address
a
meeting
tomorrow
rapley
be
up
at
me
and
turn
me
inside
out
he
do
as
much
for
the
other
man
if
only
i
pay
him
that
is
my
idea
going
to
win
the
election
satisfaction
in
looking
back
on
an
honest
piece
of
work
what
i
have
another
talk
with
him
now
look
at
this
map
of
the
town
i
coloured
it
with
much
care
there
you
see
the
stronghold
of
the
blues
i
working
that
district
street
by
street
a
sort
of
moral
invasion
no
humbug
i
set
my
face
against
humbug
if
a
man
a
rogue
or
a
sot
or
a
dirty
rascal
i
wo
shake
hands
with
him
and
pretend
you
know
respect
friendship
how
are
your
wife
and
children
so
on
he
a
vote
and
i
only
to
deal
with
him
as
a
vote
can
he
see
that
two
and
two
make
four
good
i
at
him
by
that
side
there
are
my
principles
what
have
you
to
urge
against
them
he
urges
damned
absurdities
good
i
to
him
that
they
are
damned
absurdities
at
times
wilfrid
managed
to
lead
the
talk
to
other
subjects
such
as
were
suggested
by
the
books
around
the
room
baxendale
had
read
not
a
little
and
entirely
in
the
spheres
of
fact
and
speculation
political
economy
and
all
that
appertained
to
it
was
his
speciality
but
he
was
remarkably
strong
in
metaphysics
wilfrid
had
flattered
himself
that
he
was
tolerably
familiar
with
the
highways
of
philosophy
but
baxendale
made
him
feel
his
ignorance
the
man
had
for
instance
read
kant
with
extraordinary
thoroughness
and
discussed
him
precisely
as
he
did
his
electioneering
difficulties
the
problems
of
consciousness
he
attacked
with
methodical
patience
with
intelligence
moreover
which
was
seldom
at
fault
everything
that
bore
the
appearance
of
a
knot
to
be
unravelled
had
for
him
an
immense
attraction
in
mere
mental
calculation
his
power
was
amazing
he
took
wilfrid
over
his
manufactory
one
day
and
explained
to
him
certain
complicated
pieces
of
machinery
the
description
was
not
so
lucid
as
it
might
have
been
owing
to
lack
of
words
but
it
manifested
the
completest
understanding
of
things
which
to
his
companion
were
as
hard
as
the
riddle
of
the
universe
his
modesty
withal
was
excessive
to
wilfrid
humane
culture
he
deferred
at
all
times
for
all
the
learning
which
lay
outside
his
own
sphere
he
had
boundless
reverence
wilfrid
gain
by
him
was
not
only
of
a
pleasant
personal
acquaintance
the
intercourse
extended
his
views
and
in
particular
gave
direction
to
much
that
had
hitherto
been
vague
potentiality
in
his
character
in
more
than
one
sense
this
visit
to
dunfield
was
to
prove
a
turning
point
in
his
life
beatrice
in
the
meantime
held
herself
apart
wilfrid
had
never
before
felt
himself
so
little
at
ease
in
her
presence
it
was
as
though
the
short
time
which
had
elapsed
since
their
last
meeting
had
effected
a
permanent
change
in
their
mutual
relations
previously
their
intercourse
had
gone
as
far
in
familiarity
as
was
possible
if
it
were
not
to
take
quite
a
new
colour
now
all
at
once
this
past
seemed
to
go
for
nothing
beatrice
was
the
active
source
of
change
she
was
deliberately
he
could
not
doubt
it
extending
the
distance
between
them
annulling
bygone
intimacy
shifting
into
ineffective
remoteness
all
manner
of
common
associations
things
she
would
formerly
have
understood
at
a
she
now
affected
to
need
to
have
explained
to
her
he
was
athel
to
an
extent
he
had
never
been
before
and
even
of
his
relatives
she
spoke
with
a
diminished
familiarity
she
emphasised
at
every
moment
the
characteristics
which
were
alien
to
his
sympathies
talked
of
the
or
changed
with
alarming
suddenness
from
that
to
topics
of
excessive
frivolousness
wilfrid
little
by
little
ceased
to
converse
with
her
in
the
real
sense
of
the
word
he
even
felt
uncomfortable
in
her
presence
and
baxendale
had
clear
eyes
for
at
all
events
the
outward
features
of
the
situation
on
the
fifth
day
of
wilfrid
presence
in
the
house
beatrice
took
the
opportunity
of
being
alone
with
her
aunt
to
observe
that
she
must
go
southwards
by
a
certain
train
next
morning
surely
not
protested
baxendale
ca
spare
you
yet
and
your
mother
is
still
in
berkshire
but
that
makes
no
difference
to
me
you
know
said
beatrice
often
at
home
by
myself
indeed
i
must
go
you
stay
if
i
beg
you
it
four
years
since
you
were
here
and
who
knows
how
long
it
will
be
before
i
entrap
you
again
you
already
threatened
me
you
know
with
the
peerage
and
i
very
sure
you
deign
to
honour
me
when
that
day
comes
now
there
a
good
girl
to
the
end
of
the
week
at
least
it
seemed
as
though
beatrice
would
persist
if
it
were
not
such
an
unlikely
thing
said
her
aunt
should
be
disposed
to
think
it
was
athel
who
is
driving
you
away
athel
the
girl
exclaimed
almost
haughtily
and
with
a
flush
which
disappeared
as
rapidly
as
it
came
leaving
the
lovely
face
with
a
touch
of
exquisite
paleness
mean
said
baxendale
quickly
averting
her
honest
eyes
i
fear
he
has
offended
you
can
athel
have
offended
me
beatrice
asked
with
a
certain
severity
thought
perhaps
a
remark
he
made
last
night
on
the
revival
baxendale
felt
ill
at
ease
her
first
sentence
had
been
inconsiderate
she
knew
it
as
soon
as
it
was
uttered
and
indeed
did
not
quite
see
what
could
have
induced
her
to
make
such
a
remark
she
had
not
the
habit
of
nice
conversation
which
endows
with
complete
command
of
the
tongue
but
her
wits
had
as
you
see
come
to
her
rescue
athel
opinions
on
that
subject
are
not
likely
to
offend
me
beatrice
replied
with
the
shadow
of
a
smile
am
so
afraid
lest
he
should
suspect
anything
of
the
kind
i
am
sure
it
would
grieve
him
dreadfully
the
girl
laughed
outright
though
not
with
much
joyousness
athel
be
grieved
for
such
a
cause
my
dear
aunt
you
do
know
him
he
as
little
sensitive
as
any
man
could
be
why
he
holds
it
a
duty
to
abuse
people
who
do
things
he
counts
foolish
exaggerate
returned
her
aunt
with
a
smile
beatrice
continued
vivaciously
you
do
know
him
as
well
as
i
do
we
used
to
be
always
wrangling
in
the
days
of
my
simplicity
i
have
been
marvelling
at
his
forbearance
it
would
have
been
nothing
wonderful
if
he
had
called
me
an
idiot
frankness
of
that
kind
is
the
mark
of
his
friendship
you
found
that
out
has
he
taken
occasion
yet
to
inform
you
that
your
life
is
conducted
on
an
utterly
mistaken
principle
that
you
are
shallow
and
inefficient
that
you
are
worse
than
useless
in
the
world
and
ought
if
properly
constituted
to
be
a
torment
to
yourself
none
of
these
things
he
has
said
oh
then
you
are
not
admitted
to
intimacy
you
are
not
of
the
inner
circle
she
spoke
with
a
kind
of
reckless
gaiety
a
mocking
merriment
which
her
rich
voice
and
command
of
facial
expression
made
very
effective
it
startled
her
hearer
who
when
the
girl
ceased
took
one
of
her
hands
and
patted
it
kindly
then
she
said
have
been
altogether
mistaken
for
i
did
really
think
he
had
offended
you
but
now
i
sure
you
stay
wo
you
than
you
should
think
i
run
away
from
athel
high
censure
certainly
then
she
became
silent
and
shortly
left
the
room
baxendale
sat
by
herself
musing
she
was
a
woman
given
to
thoughtfulness
for
all
that
she
used
her
tongue
freely
when
with
those
she
liked
she
did
not
greatly
seek
such
society
as
dunfield
had
to
offer
and
partly
on
that
account
partly
owing
to
alarms
excited
by
her
caustic
comments
on
matters
of
popular
interest
the
ladies
of
the
town
left
her
abundance
of
leisure
she
used
it
well
though
not
a
woman
she
read
constantly
and
books
of
a
solid
kind
society
in
dunfield
had
its
book
club
and
baxendale
enjoyed
the
advantage
of
choosing
literature
which
her
were
very
willing
to
let
her
keep
as
long
as
she
liked
beatrice
derived
much
amusement
from
her
aunt
method
of
reading
beatrice
with
the
run
of
mudie
catalogues
would
have
volumes
in
her
lap
at
the
same
time
and
as
often
as
not
get
through
them
bien
que
in
the
same
day
but
to
the
provincial
lady
a
book
was
a
solid
and
serious
affair
to
read
a
chapter
was
to
have
provided
matter
for
a
day
reflection
the
marker
was
put
at
the
place
where
reading
had
ceased
and
the
book
was
not
till
previous
matter
had
been
thoroughly
digested
and
assimilated
it
was
a
slow
method
but
not
without
its
advantages
i
assure
you
perhaps
to
relieve
her
worthy
aunt
of
any
lingering
anxiousness
beatrice
throughout
the
day
wore
an
appearance
of
much
contentment
and
to
wilfrid
was
especially
condescending
even
talking
with
him
freely
on
a
subject
quite
unconnected
with
her
pet
interests
that
evening
two
gentlemen
politicians
dined
at
the
house
beatrice
under
cover
of
their
loud
discussions
in
the
exchanged
certain
remarks
with
wilfrid
aunt
was
so
good
as
to
apologise
to
me
on
your
behalf
this
morning
she
began
what
have
i
been
guilty
of
nothing
she
does
appreciate
the
freemasonry
between
us
it
occurred
to
her
that
your
remarks
on
my
well
my
predilections
might
have
troubled
me
judge
how
amused
i
was
she
did
not
look
at
him
from
the
first
and
appeared
to
be
examining
even
whilst
she
spoke
a
book
of
prints
sincerely
hope
wilfrid
replied
i
have
uttered
no
thoughtless
piece
of
rudeness
if
i
have
i
beg
you
to
forgive
me
she
glanced
at
him
he
appeared
to
speak
seriously
and
it
was
the
kind
of
speech
he
would
never
have
dreamed
of
making
to
her
in
former
days
at
all
events
in
this
tone
know
perfectly
well
she
answered
with
slow
voice
bending
to
look
more
closely
at
a
page
you
never
said
anything
to
me
which
could
call
for
apology
am
not
so
sure
of
that
wilfrid
replied
smiling
take
my
assurance
now
said
beatrice
closing
her
book
and
rising
to
move
towards
her
aunt
as
she
went
she
cast
a
look
back
a
look
of
curious
blankness
as
if
into
vacancy
she
sang
shortly
after
and
the
souls
of
the
politicians
were
stirred
within
them
for
wilfrid
he
lay
back
with
his
eyes
closed
his
heart
borne
on
the
flood
of
music
to
that
room
of
sickness
whose
occupant
must
needs
be
so
sadly
pale
the
security
he
felt
in
the
knowledge
that
emily
grew
better
daily
made
him
able
to
talk
cheerfully
and
behave
like
one
without
preoccupation
but
emily
in
truth
was
never
out
of
his
mind
he
lived
towards
the
day
when
he
should
kneel
at
her
feet
and
feel
once
more
upon
his
forehead
those
cold
pure
lips
and
that
day
as
he
believed
was
now
very
near
to
her
aunt
secret
surprise
beatrice
allowed
the
end
of
the
week
to
come
and
go
without
any
allusion
to
the
subject
of
departure
it
was
all
the
more
strange
seeing
that
the
girl
show
of
easy
friendliness
with
wilfrid
had
not
lasted
beyond
the
day
she
had
become
as
distant
and
as
before
but
on
the
morning
of
the
following
tuesday
as
baxendale
sat
reading
not
long
after
breakfast
beatrice
entered
the
room
in
her
light
travelling
garb
and
came
forward
buttoning
her
glove
are
going
out
baxendale
asked
with
some
misgiving
to
london
they
are
calling
a
cab
you
know
how
i
dislike
preparatory
miseries
her
aunt
kept
astonished
silence
she
looked
at
the
girl
then
down
at
her
book
she
said
at
length
only
remains
to
me
to
remember
the
old
proverb
but
when
is
the
train
are
you
off
this
moment
train
leaves
in
minutes
may
i
disturb
uncle
do
you
think
now
i
understand
why
you
asked
if
he
would
be
at
home
through
the
morning
i
go
and
fetch
him
she
went
quickly
to
the
library
baxendale
sat
there
alone
is
going
she
said
coming
behind
his
chair
you
come
and
say
baxendale
jumped
up
leaving
his
wife
nodded
what
is
it
you
have
quarrelled
with
her
about
the
it
a
fancy
of
hers
that
all
come
along
she
only
twenty
minutes
to
catch
the
train
when
they
reached
the
beatrice
was
not
there
upon
baxendale
withdrawal
she
had
gone
to
wilfrid
door
and
knocked
at
it
wilfrid
was
pacing
about
in
thought
it
surprised
him
to
see
who
his
visitor
was
yet
more
when
she
advanced
to
him
with
her
hand
extended
saying
a
simple
wherefore
her
attire
explained
beatrice
possessed
the
beauty
of
form
and
face
which
makes
profit
of
any
costume
in
the
cape
and
hat
to
match
her
tall
lithe
figure
had
a
womanly
dignity
which
suited
well
with
the
unsmiling
expressiveness
of
her
countenance
the
was
uttered
briefly
and
without
emphasis
as
one
uses
any
insignificant
form
of
speech
wilfrid
resolved
at
once
to
accept
her
whim
after
all
it
was
but
another
instance
of
frequent
eccentricities
is
going
to
the
station
with
you
he
asked
one
i
hate
partings
on
the
platform
she
moved
away
almost
as
far
as
the
door
then
turned
again
will
be
in
town
before
going
back
to
oxford
wilfrid
hesitated
never
mind
she
said
and
was
gone
ten
minutes
later
wilfrid
went
to
the
and
baxendale
were
talking
together
they
became
silent
as
he
entered
miss
redwing
gone
he
asked
took
leave
of
you
did
she
replied
the
lady
but
it
was
so
unprepared
for
i
half
thought
it
might
be
a
joke
she
fond
of
these
surprises
baxendale
said
in
a
tone
of
allowance
the
whole
i
sympathise
with
her
i
myself
prefer
not
to
linger
over
such
occasions
later
in
the
day
baxendale
drove
out
to
banbrigg
this
time
alone
on
her
return
she
sought
wilfrid
and
found
him
in
his
room
there
was
concern
on
her
face
have
heard
something
very
painful
from
mrs
hood
she
began
seems
that
emily
is
in
ignorance
of
her
father
death
wilfrid
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
told
you
baxendale
pursued
she
had
not
been
altogether
well
just
before
it
happened
but
it
now
appears
that
the
dreadful
incident
of
her
entering
the
room
just
when
the
body
was
brought
in
must
have
taken
place
when
she
was
delirious
the
poor
woman
has
had
no
suspicion
of
that
but
it
is
proved
by
emily
questions
now
that
she
begins
to
talk
of
course
it
makes
a
new
anxiety
mrs
hood
has
not
dared
to
hint
at
the
truth
but
it
can
not
be
concealed
for
long
this
is
most
extraordinary
wilfrid
exclaimed
then
was
the
origin
of
her
illness
is
the
mystery
mrs
hood
memory
seems
to
be
confused
but
i
got
her
to
allow
that
the
feverish
symptoms
were
declared
even
the
night
before
the
death
was
known
i
hardly
like
to
hint
it
but
it
really
seemed
to
me
as
if
she
were
keeping
something
back
one
moment
she
said
that
emily
had
been
made
ill
by
anxiety
at
her
father
lateness
in
coming
home
that
night
and
the
next
she
seemed
for
some
reason
unwilling
to
admit
that
it
was
so
the
poor
woman
is
in
a
sad
sad
state
and
no
wonder
she
wishes
that
somebody
else
might
tell
emily
the
truth
but
surely
it
will
come
most
easily
from
her
wilfrid
was
deeply
distressed
is
the
very
worst
that
still
remains
he
said
we
thought
the
worst
was
over
what
does
the
doctor
say
can
she
bear
it
yet
it
is
impossible
to
let
her
continue
in
ignorance
it
was
at
length
decided
that
baxendale
should
visit
the
doctor
and
hear
his
opinion
she
had
got
into
her
mind
a
certain
distrust
of
mrs
hood
and
even
doubted
whether
emily
ought
to
be
left
in
her
hands
during
convalescence
there
was
clearly
no
want
of
devotion
on
the
mother
part
but
it
appeared
to
baxendale
that
the
poor
woman
had
been
overtaxed
and
was
herself
on
the
point
of
illness
perhaps
of
mental
failure
from
going
well
things
had
suddenly
taken
an
anxious
turn
chapter
xvi
renunciation
when
emily
returned
from
the
wastes
of
ravaged
mind
and
while
yet
the
images
of
memory
were
hardly
distinguished
from
the
ghosts
of
delirious
dream
the
picture
that
haunted
her
with
most
persistency
with
an
objective
reality
the
more
impressive
the
clearer
her
thought
became
was
one
which
she
could
least
comprehend
or
account
for
she
saw
lying
before
her
a
closely
muffled
form
the
outline
seeming
to
declare
it
that
of
a
man
the
struggle
of
consciousness
was
to
associate
such
a
vision
with
the
events
which
had
preceded
her
illness
perchance
for
a
day
perchance
only
for
an
hour
however
long
the
unmeasured
transition
from
darkness
to
the
dawn
of
she
suffered
the
oppression
of
this
mechanical
questioning
at
length
the
presence
of
her
mother
by
the
bedside
became
a
fact
and
it
led
on
to
the
thought
of
her
father
her
eyes
moved
in
search
for
him
the
act
of
speech
in
health
a
mere
emphasis
of
thought
was
only
to
be
attained
by
repetition
of
efforts
several
times
she
believed
herself
to
have
spoken
whilst
silence
still
pressed
her
lips
only
when
the
recollection
of
her
last
waking
day
was
complete
and
when
the
absence
of
her
father
from
the
room
linked
itself
to
memory
of
her
anguished
waiting
for
him
did
she
succeed
in
uttering
the
words
which
represented
her
fear
her
mother
was
bending
over
her
aware
of
the
new
light
in
her
questioning
eyes
father
emily
asked
shall
see
him
dear
was
the
reply
speak
came
home
he
came
home
emily
fell
back
into
thought
this
great
fear
allayed
the
only
now
like
an
angel
coming
from
afar
over
dark
waters
past
continued
to
rebuild
itself
within
her
mind
and
now
there
gleamed
the
image
of
her
love
it
had
been
expelled
from
memory
by
the
woe
of
those
last
hours
it
returned
like
a
soothing
warmth
an
assuagement
of
pain
as
though
music
sounded
about
her
she
again
lost
her
hold
on
outward
things
and
sank
into
a
natural
sleep
mrs
hood
feared
the
next
waking
the
question
about
her
father
she
attributed
to
emily
incomplete
command
of
her
faculties
for
she
had
not
doubted
that
the
muffled
figure
on
the
couch
had
been
consciously
seen
by
the
girl
and
understood
yet
with
waking
the
error
prolonged
itself
it
became
evident
at
length
that
emily
knew
nothing
of
her
coming
down
to
the
and
still
had
to
learn
that
her
father
no
longer
lived
it
was
a
new
suffering
under
which
the
poor
woman
gave
way
already
her
natural
affliction
was
complicated
with
a
sense
of
painful
mysteries
in
her
delirium
emily
had
uttered
words
which
there
was
no
explaining
but
which
proved
that
there
had
been
some
hidden
connection
between
her
mental
trouble
and
her
father
failure
to
return
at
the
usual
hour
dagworthy
name
she
had
spoken
frequently
and
with
words
which
called
to
mind
the
sum
of
money
her
father
had
somehow
procured
mrs
hood
had
no
strength
to
face
trials
such
as
these
as
long
as
her
child
life
seemed
in
danger
she
strove
with
a
predominant
instinct
to
defend
it
but
her
powers
failed
as
emily
passed
out
of
peril
her
outlook
became
blank
physical
exhaustion
joined
with
mental
suffering
began
to
render
her
incapable
of
further
efforts
fortunately
baxendale
perceived
this
in
time
a
nurse
was
provided
in
addition
to
the
one
who
had
assisted
mrs
hood
and
the
mother
became
herself
the
object
of
care
emily
had
been
told
that
her
father
was
ill
but
this
fiction
it
was
soon
impossible
to
maintain
three
days
after
the
last
reported
conversation
between
wilfrid
and
baxendale
it
was
determined
that
the
latter
must
take
upon
herself
the
office
of
telling
emily
the
truth
mrs
hood
implored
her
to
do
so
the
poor
mother
was
sinking
into
a
state
which
scarcely
left
her
the
command
of
her
mind
and
though
she
could
not
sustain
the
duty
herself
it
was
her
harassing
desire
that
it
might
quickly
be
performed
so
at
length
the
revelation
was
made
made
with
all
the
forbearance
and
strengthening
tenderness
of
which
a
woman
is
capable
but
the
first
syllables
prepared
emily
for
the
whole
truth
a
secret
dread
which
she
had
not
dared
to
confess
to
herself
on
that
last
evening
though
probably
it
brought
about
the
crisis
in
her
suffering
and
which
the
false
assurances
recently
given
her
had
perhaps
not
wholly
overcome
rushed
forth
as
soon
as
evil
was
hinted
at
the
softened
statement
that
her
father
had
been
stricken
down
by
a
natural
malady
did
not
for
a
moment
deceive
her
she
closed
her
eyes
the
pillows
which
supported
her
were
scarcely
whiter
than
her
face
but
she
was
soon
able
to
speak
with
perfect
he
brought
home
wrapped
in
something
she
asked
his
face
covered
was
emily
and
where
did
i
see
him
for
i
know
i
did
see
him
mother
has
told
me
that
you
rose
from
your
bed
and
went
to
the
room
below
she
did
not
realise
that
you
were
unconscious
she
believed
that
you
knew
of
this
this
was
her
dread
vision
as
if
to
protect
herself
from
it
she
raised
her
hand
and
laid
it
across
her
eyes
then
it
fell
again
to
the
coverlet
thin
hand
which
in
its
translucency
of
flesh
seemed
to
have
been
created
by
spirit
for
its
chosen
abode
when
silence
had
lasted
some
moments
that
i
know
he
is
dead
emily
resumed
oh
the
sad
music
of
the
last
word
can
bear
to
hear
the
manner
of
it
without
disguise
will
you
tell
me
the
whole
truth
mrs
baxendale
it
was
spoken
like
herself
ever
clinging
to
sincerity
ever
ready
to
face
the
truth
of
things
in
how
many
a
matter
of
less
moment
had
the
girl
spoken
with
just
this
directness
inspiring
respect
in
all
who
heard
her
clear
candid
voice
baxendale
sank
her
eyes
and
hesitated
died
by
his
own
hand
emily
said
below
her
breath
the
lady
kept
silence
emily
again
closed
her
eyes
and
as
she
so
lay
felt
warm
lips
touch
her
forehead
baxendale
believed
for
a
moment
that
the
sufferer
had
lost
consciousness
but
the
utterance
of
her
name
caused
emily
to
raise
her
lids
did
he
do
this
she
asked
regarding
her
friend
fixedly
one
can
say
dear
emily
drew
a
deep
sigh
a
gleam
passed
over
her
face
was
an
inquest
she
asked
it
possible
for
me
to
see
a
newspaper
in
which
it
was
reported
you
really
desire
it
said
baxendale
with
hesitation
do
i
wish
to
read
it
will
you
do
me
that
great
kindness
will
bring
it
you
in
a
day
or
two
but
would
it
not
be
better
to
delay
there
anything
emily
asked
quickly
you
have
kept
from
me
nothing
i
need
not
put
off
reading
it
i
have
borne
the
worst
as
baxendale
left
the
house
she
was
passed
at
a
short
distance
along
the
road
by
a
man
on
horseback
this
rider
gave
a
sign
to
the
coachman
to
stop
and
a
moment
after
presented
himself
at
the
window
of
the
brougham
it
was
dagworthy
he
wished
to
have
news
of
and
miss
hood
the
lady
gave
him
full
information
fear
i
could
not
see
mrs
hood
dagworthy
said
she
is
far
too
ill
was
the
reply
having
assured
himself
on
this
point
dagworthy
took
his
leave
and
when
the
carriage
was
remote
rode
to
the
house
he
made
fast
the
reins
to
the
gate
entered
and
knocked
at
the
door
a
girl
who
did
subordinate
work
for
the
nurses
opened
want
you
dagworthy
said
give
this
note
at
once
to
miss
hood
you
understand
to
miss
hood
will
you
do
so
will
sir
he
went
away
and
immediately
after
emily
was
reading
these
lines
wish
to
tell
you
that
no
one
has
heard
and
no
one
ever
will
of
the
circumstances
you
would
desire
to
have
unknown
i
send
this
as
soon
as
you
are
able
to
receive
it
you
will
know
from
whom
it
comes
she
knew
and
the
message
aided
her
the
shook
of
what
she
had
just
heard
was
not
in
its
immediate
effect
as
severe
as
others
had
feared
it
would
be
perhaps
emily
own
sojourn
at
the
gates
of
death
lessened
the
distance
between
her
and
him
who
had
passed
them
perhaps
the
vast
misery
which
lay
behind
her
the
darkness
threatening
in
the
future
brought
first
to
her
mind
death
attribute
of
deliverance
this
in
the
hours
that
followed
she
strove
to
dwell
upon
nothing
could
touch
her
father
now
he
was
safe
from
trouble
but
as
the
current
in
her
veins
grew
warmer
as
life
held
her
with
a
stronger
hand
and
made
her
once
more
participant
in
his
fears
and
desires
that
apparition
of
the
motionless
veiled
form
haunted
her
with
access
of
horror
if
she
slept
it
came
into
her
dreams
and
her
waking
thoughts
strove
with
hideous
wilfulness
to
unmuffle
that
dead
face
when
horror
failed
its
place
was
taken
by
a
grief
so
intense
that
it
shook
the
fabric
of
her
being
she
had
no
relapse
in
health
but
convalescence
was
severed
from
all
its
natural
joys
she
grew
stronger
only
to
mourn
more
passionately
in
imagination
she
followed
her
father
through
the
hours
of
despair
which
must
have
ensued
on
his
interview
with
dagworthy
she
pictured
his
struggle
between
desire
to
return
home
to
find
comfort
among
those
he
loved
and
the
bitter
shame
which
forbade
it
how
had
he
spent
the
time
did
he
wander
out
of
the
town
to
lonely
places
until
daylight
failed
did
he
then
come
back
under
the
shadow
of
the
night
come
back
all
but
to
the
very
door
of
his
dwelling
make
one
last
effort
to
face
those
within
pass
on
in
blind
agony
was
he
on
the
heath
at
the
very
hour
when
she
crossed
it
to
go
to
dagworthy
house
oh
had
that
been
his
figure
which
as
she
hurried
past
she
had
seen
moving
in
the
darkness
of
the
quarry
a
pity
which
at
times
grew
too
vast
for
the
soul
to
contain
absorbed
her
life
the
pity
which
overwhelms
and
crushes
which
threatens
reason
that
he
should
have
lived
through
long
years
of
the
most
patient
endurance
keeping
ever
a
hope
a
faith
so
so
void
of
bitter
feeling
so
kindly
disposed
to
all
men
only
to
be
vanquished
at
length
by
a
moment
of
inexplicable
weakness
only
to
creep
aside
and
hide
his
shame
and
die
her
father
whom
it
was
her
heart
longing
to
tend
and
cherish
through
the
brighter
days
of
his
age
lying
there
in
his
grave
where
no
voice
could
reach
him
remote
for
ever
from
the
solace
of
loving
kindness
his
death
a
perpetuation
of
woe
the
cruelty
of
fate
had
exhausted
itself
what
had
the
world
to
show
more
pitiful
than
this
no
light
ever
came
to
her
countenance
no
faintest
smile
ever
touched
her
lips
through
the
hours
through
the
days
she
lay
heedless
of
things
around
her
solely
occupied
with
the
past
with
affliction
with
remorse
had
it
not
been
in
her
power
to
save
him
a
word
from
her
and
at
this
moment
he
would
have
been
living
in
cheerfulness
such
as
he
had
never
known
she
would
have
had
but
to
turn
her
head
and
his
smile
would
have
met
her
the
rare
laugh
so
touching
to
her
always
would
have
become
less
rare
his
struggles
would
have
been
over
she
had
willed
that
he
should
die
had
sent
him
forth
relentlessly
to
his
last
trial
to
his
forsaken
end
without
a
he
had
gone
forth
his
last
look
had
been
at
her
blank
windows
that
hour
was
passed
into
eternity
and
with
it
the
better
part
of
her
life
on
the
first
day
that
she
rose
from
her
bed
she
went
with
the
aid
to
her
mother
room
what
she
saw
there
was
a
new
shock
her
mother
face
had
aged
incredibly
and
wore
a
look
of
such
feeble
intelligence
that
to
meet
her
eyes
was
more
than
painful
upon
the
artificial
maintenance
of
her
strength
throughout
emily
illness
had
followed
a
collapse
of
the
vital
powers
it
seemed
doubtful
whether
she
would
ever
regain
her
normal
state
of
mind
and
body
she
knew
her
daughter
and
when
emily
kissed
her
the
muscles
of
her
haggard
face
contracted
in
what
was
meant
for
a
smile
but
she
could
not
use
her
voice
above
a
whisper
and
her
words
were
seldom
consequent
two
days
later
baxendale
again
paid
a
visit
emily
was
sitting
in
her
unoccupied
on
her
countenance
the
gravity
which
never
quitted
it
the
visitor
when
she
had
made
her
inquiries
seemed
to
prepare
herself
to
speak
of
some
subject
at
once
important
and
cheerful
a
fortnight
she
said
have
had
staying
with
me
someone
whom
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
of
your
nearest
friend
emily
raised
her
eyes
slowly
to
the
speaker
face
clearly
she
understood
but
was
accustoming
herself
to
this
unexpected
relation
between
baxendale
and
wilfrid
athel
came
from
switzerland
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
your
illness
did
he
hear
emily
inquired
gravely
niece
miss
redwing
whom
you
knew
happened
to
be
visiting
me
she
wrote
to
mrs
rossall
emily
was
silent
the
lines
of
her
mouth
showed
a
slight
tremor
but
no
colour
sought
her
cheeks
the
news
was
affecting
her
strongly
but
only
in
the
way
in
which
she
now
received
every
impression
physical
weakness
had
the
effect
of
reducing
outward
demonstration
of
feeling
and
her
spiritual
condition
favoured
passiveness
has
asked
me
to
give
you
a
letter
emily
pursued
baxendale
saddened
by
the
sight
of
such
intense
sadness
emily
took
the
letter
and
laid
it
on
a
table
near
her
murmuring
her
thanks
is
well
she
asked
as
the
other
did
not
speak
his
holiday
has
completely
restored
him
you
ca
think
how
glad
i
am
to
have
come
to
know
him
and
to
have
him
near
me
such
excellent
friends
we
are
you
can
think
how
anxious
he
has
been
and
his
father
scarcely
less
so
the
inquiries
have
been
constant
the
others
have
just
got
home
athel
had
a
letter
from
london
this
morning
the
little
girls
send
you
a
message
i
believe
you
will
find
the
letter
enclosed
at
the
mention
of
the
twins
the
slightest
smile
came
upon
emily
lips
are
fond
of
them
i
see
said
the
lady
they
ire
fond
of
you
needs
no
telling
oh
and
clara
writes
from
germany
to
ask
if
she
may
write
to
you
yet
shall
i
let
her
a
few
more
words
and
baxendale
rose
emily
retained
her
hand
have
not
yet
had
from
me
one
word
of
gratitude
baxendale
she
said
i
have
no
words
in
which
to
thank
you
the
lady
kissed
her
forehead
pressed
the
thin
hand
again
and
went
for
a
few
moments
to
mrs
hood
room
before
departing
it
was
nearly
an
hour
before
emily
took
up
the
letter
to
open
it
when
at
length
she
did
so
she
found
that
it
covered
only
a
small
sheet
of
notepaper
enclosed
was
a
letter
from
athel
announcing
the
arrival
in
london
asking
in
a
kind
tone
for
the
latest
news
and
repeating
the
message
from
the
twins
of
which
baxendale
had
spoken
wilfrid
wrote
with
admirable
delicacy
and
feeling
he
forgot
himself
wholly
in
her
affliction
and
only
in
those
simplest
words
which
can
still
be
made
the
most
powerful
uttered
the
tenderness
which
he
hoped
might
speak
some
comfort
to
her
heart
he
did
not
ask
to
see
her
would
she
not
bid
him
come
to
her
in
her
own
good
time
and
only
if
her
strength
rendered
it
quite
easy
he
begged
for
one
word
of
reply
baxendale
would
visit
her
again
very
shortly
and
to
her
the
answer
could
be
given
emily
returned
the
writings
to
their
envelope
and
sat
through
the
day
as
she
had
sat
since
morning
scarcely
ever
moving
without
heed
of
things
that
were
said
or
done
in
the
room
before
quitting
the
chair
for
her
bed
she
went
to
spend
a
quarter
of
an
hour
by
her
mother
whose
hand
she
held
throughout
the
time
mrs
hood
lay
in
the
same
state
of
alternating
with
sleep
in
the
night
she
generally
wandered
a
little
but
she
did
not
seem
to
suffer
pain
emily
could
not
sleep
hitherto
her
rest
had
been
profound
between
sunset
and
early
morning
as
she
had
sat
through
the
day
so
she
lay
now
her
eyes
fixed
in
the
same
intent
gaze
as
on
something
unfolding
itself
before
her
when
the
nurses
had
ceased
to
move
about
the
house
was
wrapped
in
a
stillness
more
complete
than
of
old
for
the
clock
had
not
been
touched
since
the
night
when
the
weight
fell
in
the
room
you
might
have
heard
now
and
then
a
deep
sigh
such
sigh
as
comes
from
a
soul
overcharged
baxendale
allowed
one
day
to
intervene
then
came
again
she
did
not
directly
speak
of
wilfrid
and
only
when
she
sat
in
significant
silence
emily
said
i
shall
go
downstairs
will
you
ask
athel
to
come
and
see
me
i
will
at
what
hour
shall
he
come
shall
be
down
by
eleven
later
in
the
day
cartwright
and
jessie
called
hitherto
emily
had
begged
that
no
one
might
be
admitted
save
baxendale
she
felt
it
would
be
unkindness
to
refuse
her
friends
any
longer
and
the
visitors
came
up
and
sat
for
a
while
with
her
both
were
awed
by
the
face
which
met
them
they
talked
scarcely
above
a
whisper
and
were
sadly
troubled
by
the
necessity
of
keeping
a
watch
upon
their
tongues
emily
was
now
able
to
descend
the
stairs
without
difficulty
the
first
sight
of
the
little
parlour
cost
her
a
renewal
of
her
keenest
suffering
there
was
the
couch
on
which
his
dead
body
had
been
placed
that
the
chair
in
which
he
always
rested
after
tea
before
going
up
to
the
laboratory
in
a
little
frame
on
the
mantelpiece
was
his
likeness
an
old
one
and
much
faded
she
moved
about
laying
her
hand
on
this
object
and
that
she
took
the
seat
by
the
window
where
she
had
waited
each
evening
till
she
saw
him
at
the
gate
to
rise
at
once
and
open
to
him
she
had
not
shed
tears
since
that
last
day
of
his
life
and
now
it
was
only
a
passing
mist
that
dimmed
her
eyes
her
sorrow
was
not
of
the
kind
which
so
relieves
itself
she
had
come
down
early
in
order
to
spend
some
time
in
the
room
before
wilfrid
arrival
she
sat
in
her
father
chair
once
more
in
the
attitude
of
motionless
brooding
but
her
countenance
was
not
as
as
during
the
past
days
emotions
struggles
at
work
within
her
found
their
outward
expression
at
times
she
breathed
quickly
as
if
in
pain
often
her
eyes
closed
in
her
worn
face
the
features
marked
themselves
with
strong
significance
it
was
beauty
of
a
kind
only
to
be
felt
by
a
soul
in
sympathy
with
her
own
to
others
she
would
have
appeared
the
image
of
stern
woe
the
gentleness
which
had
been
so
readily
observable
beneath
her
habitual
gravity
was
absorbed
in
the
severity
of
her
suffering
and
spiritual
conflicts
only
a
touching
suggestion
of
endurance
of
weakness
bearing
up
against
terrible
fatality
made
its
plea
to
tenderness
withal
she
looked
no
older
than
in
the
days
of
her
happiness
a
young
life
a
young
heart
smitten
with
unutterable
woe
when
the
sound
of
the
opening
gate
made
itself
heard
she
lay
back
for
a
moment
in
the
very
sickness
of
pain
it
recalled
the
past
so
vividly
and
chilled
her
heart
with
the
fear
of
what
she
had
now
before
her
she
stood
as
soon
as
the
knock
came
at
the
front
door
and
kept
the
same
position
as
wilfrid
entered
he
was
startled
at
the
sight
of
her
but
in
an
instant
was
holding
both
her
hands
gazing
deep
into
her
eyes
with
an
ecstasy
of
tenderness
he
kissed
her
lips
and
as
he
did
so
felt
a
shudder
in
the
hands
he
pressed
a
few
whispered
words
were
all
that
he
could
speak
emily
kept
silence
then
he
sat
near
to
her
her
hand
was
still
in
his
but
gave
no
sign
of
responsive
affection
and
was
very
cold
was
kind
to
let
me
see
you
so
soon
he
said
her
fixed
look
of
hard
suffering
began
to
impress
him
painfully
even
with
a
kind
of
fear
emily
face
at
this
moment
was
that
of
one
who
is
only
half
sensible
to
words
spoken
now
she
herself
spoke
for
the
first
time
will
forgive
me
that
i
did
not
write
it
would
have
been
better
perhaps
it
would
have
been
easier
to
me
yet
why
should
i
fear
to
say
to
you
face
to
face
what
i
have
to
say
the
last
sentence
was
like
uttered
aloud
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
and
with
appeal
which
searched
his
heart
to
say
to
me
wilfrid
repeated
gravely
though
without
apprehension
your
suffering
made
strangers
of
us
in
the
way
you
mean
but
it
has
so
changed
my
life
that
i
can
not
meet
you
as
i
should
have
done
her
utterance
quickened
her
voice
lost
its
steadiness
you
be
very
generous
to
me
as
good
and
noble
as
it
is
in
your
heart
to
be
i
ask
you
to
give
me
back
my
promise
to
release
me
he
gazed
at
her
in
bewilderment
his
thought
was
that
she
was
not
herself
her
manner
since
his
entrance
seemed
to
confirm
it
the
tortured
lines
of
her
face
seemed
to
express
illusory
fears
do
you
know
what
you
say
dearest
i
know
what
i
say
and
i
know
how
hard
you
find
it
to
believe
me
if
i
could
explain
to
you
what
it
is
that
makes
this
change
you
would
not
wonder
at
it
you
would
understand
you
would
see
that
i
am
doing
the
only
thing
i
can
do
but
i
can
not
give
you
my
reasons
that
must
be
my
sad
secret
to
the
end
of
my
life
you
feel
you
have
a
claim
to
hear
the
truth
indeed
indeed
you
have
but
you
will
be
forbearing
and
generous
release
me
wilfrid
i
ask
it
as
the
last
and
greatest
proof
of
the
love
you
gave
me
he
rose
with
a
gesture
of
desperation
i
can
not
bear
this
you
are
ill
my
own
darling
i
should
have
waited
till
you
were
stronger
i
should
have
left
you
more
time
to
turn
your
thoughts
to
me
from
these
terrible
things
you
have
passed
through
he
flung
himself
by
her
side
grasping
her
hands
passionately
one
how
you
have
suffered
it
kills
me
to
look
into
your
face
i
speak
let
me
only
stay
by
you
like
this
for
a
few
minutes
will
not
my
love
calm
you
love
the
purest
and
tenderest
that
man
ever
felt
i
would
die
to
heal
your
heart
of
its
grief
with
a
great
sob
of
uttermost
anguish
she
put
back
his
hands
rose
from
the
chair
and
stood
apart
wilfrid
rose
and
gazed
at
her
in
dread
had
the
last
calamity
of
human
nature
fallen
upon
her
he
looked
about
as
if
for
aid
emily
read
his
thoughts
perfectly
they
helped
her
to
a
desperate
composure
she
said
i
speak
like
one
not
in
her
perfect
mind
can
not
say
your
words
are
meaningless
to
me
you
are
not
the
emily
i
knew
am
not
was
her
sad
answer
you
can
bring
yourself
to
believe
that
truth
you
will
spare
yourself
and
me
do
you
mean
when
you
say
that
he
asked
his
voice
intensified
in
suppression
you
are
in
full
command
of
yourself
if
your
memory
holds
all
the
past
what
can
have
made
of
you
another
being
we
dare
not
play
with
words
at
a
time
such
as
this
tell
me
at
least
one
thing
do
i
know
what
it
was
that
caused
your
illness
do
understand
you
her
eyes
examined
him
with
fear
mean
emily
was
it
solely
due
to
that
shock
you
received
or
was
there
any
previous
distress
anything
led
you
to
think
there
was
she
asked
urgently
baxendale
tells
me
you
emily
why
have
i
to
pain
you
in
this
way
tell
me
tell
me
what
did
she
say
on
coming
to
yourself
you
did
not
know
of
your
father
death
is
true
i
did
not
my
illness
began
before
wilfrid
stood
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
me
again
she
said
else
did
baxendale
say
her
surprise
when
she
heard
this
from
your
mother
was
as
great
as
mine
when
it
was
repeated
to
me
is
true
emily
repeated
more
calmly
as
if
relieved
do
try
to
conceal
that
there
is
a
reason
i
may
not
speak
of
will
you
not
believe
that
it
is
strong
enough
to
change
my
life
if
i
did
not
tell
you
this
you
might
indeed
refuse
to
listen
to
me
thinking
i
was
not
myself
i
can
not
tell
you
more
i
can
not
i
can
not
she
pressed
her
palms
upon
her
forehead
it
throbbed
with
pain
scarcely
to
be
borne
wilfrid
after
a
moment
of
wretched
hesitation
said
gravely
forbid
me
to
ask
i
may
not
even
wish
to
know
i
have
come
to
regard
your
will
as
the
seal
upon
everything
that
is
true
and
right
knowing
this
seeing
me
here
before
you
with
my
best
hopes
at
stake
do
you
tell
me
that
something
has
happened
which
makes
the
bond
between
us
of
no
effect
which
lays
upon
you
a
duty
superior
to
that
of
the
pledge
you
gave
me
she
met
his
gaze
and
answered
firmly
do
duty
he
continued
with
quivering
voice
with
which
the
sacredness
of
our
love
is
nothing
she
trembled
from
head
to
foot
then
as
if
clutching
at
a
last
help
said
do
not
love
you
and
she
waited
with
her
head
bowed
wilfrid
taking
up
his
hat
went
to
her
and
offered
his
hand
when
hers
was
given
your
eyes
and
look
at
me
emily
she
did
so
are
still
in
the
shadow
of
a
great
grief
and
it
may
well
be
that
all
other
things
seem
trivial
i
wish
to
respect
you
to
the
uttermost
and
i
will
try
to
conceive
that
there
is
a
motive
high
enough
to
justify
you
but
those
last
words
must
be
repeated
when
time
has
come
to
your
aid
before
i
can
regard
them
as
final
he
released
her
hand
and
left
her
what
was
her
first
sensation
when
the
door
had
closed
then
the
gate
without
and
wilfrid
in
very
deed
was
gone
was
it
hopeless
misery
failure
dread
foresight
of
the
life
which
she
still
must
live
rather
her
mood
was
that
of
the
martyr
who
has
held
firm
to
the
last
wrench
of
torture
who
feels
that
agony
is
overcome
and
fear
of
self
surpassed
this
possibility
had
there
ever
been
in
emily
though
associating
with
such
variant
instincts
circumstances
had
brought
the
occasion
which
weighed
one
part
of
her
nature
against
the
other
and
with
this
result
you
may
not
judge
her
coldly
yet
it
is
possible
to
indicate
those
points
which
connect
her
enthusiasm
of
sacrifice
with
the
reasonings
and
emotions
of
the
impartial
mind
in
the
moment
that
she
heard
of
her
father
she
knew
that
her
own
destiny
was
cast
the
struggle
with
desire
with
arguments
of
her
with
claims
of
others
this
also
she
foresaw
and
measured
her
resolve
came
of
the
interaction
of
intense
feeling
feeling
which
only
process
of
time
could
reduce
from
its
morbid
predominance
and
that
idealism
which
was
the
keynote
of
her
personality
it
was
not
that
she
condemned
herself
for
having
refused
to
pay
the
price
which
would
have
saved
her
father
she
may
have
done
so
in
her
wildest
paroxysms
of
grief
but
in
the
silences
which
ensued
she
knew
that
there
is
an
arbiter
above
natural
affection
and
that
not
with
impunity
could
a
life
be
purchased
by
the
death
of
a
soul
she
had
refused
it
might
be
she
would
still
have
refused
had
she
foreseen
the
worst
but
could
she
move
on
over
her
father
body
to
a
life
of
joy
not
only
did
piety
forbid
it
the
compassionate
voice
of
her
heart
cried
against
what
she
deemed
such
cruelty
her
father
was
dead
nothing
that
she
did
henceforth
would
concern
him
for
good
or
ill
none
the
less
in
her
eyes
was
his
claim
upon
her
the
claim
of
one
she
had
tenderly
loved
calling
to
her
for
pity
from
that
desolate
grave
which
of
us
entirely
that
surviving
claim
of
the
beloved
dead
which
of
us
would
in
his
purest
hour
desire
to
do
so
she
could
not
save
him
but
as
she
valued
her
most
precious
human
privileges
she
dared
not
taste
the
fruits
of
life
of
which
he
was
for
ever
robbed
between
her
and
happiness
loomed
that
agonising
face
she
might
disregard
it
might
close
her
eyes
and
press
on
might
live
down
the
old
sacred
pity
and
give
herself
to
absorbing
bliss
what
would
be
the
true
value
of
that
she
gained
nay
it
was
idle
to
affect
that
she
had
the
choice
she
felt
that
the
first
memory
of
that
face
in
the
midst
of
enjoyment
would
break
her
heart
those
last
dark
hours
of
his
she
must
live
and
relive
in
her
own
mind
dead
he
was
dead
oh
did
not
the
very
tones
of
his
voice
linger
in
the
rooms
where
she
sat
could
she
not
see
him
enter
hold
to
her
his
hand
bend
and
kiss
her
did
she
not
fancy
constantly
that
his
foot
sounded
on
the
floor
above
her
up
in
the
bare
little
room
where
she
had
parted
from
him
unkindly
why
death
meant
but
little
for
at
any
moment
he
was
in
truth
standing
by
her
years
of
unhappiness
and
then
to
be
put
aside
and
forgotten
as
soon
as
the
heavy
clods
of
earth
had
fallen
upon
him
to
think
of
that
was
to
be
driven
almost
to
madness
by
the
impotence
of
grief
rather
than
allow
a
joy
to
tempt
her
thought
she
would
cast
life
from
her
and
be
his
companion
in
that
narrow
home
and
her
character
brought
it
about
that
the
very
strength
of
her
love
for
wilfrid
acted
as
another
impulse
to
renunciation
which
had
been
the
stronger
motive
in
her
refusal
to
sacrifice
herself
the
preservation
of
her
chaste
womanhood
or
the
inability
to
give
up
him
she
loved
could
she
at
the
tribunal
of
her
conscience
affirm
that
her
decision
had
held
no
mixture
of
the
less
pure
nay
had
she
not
known
that
revolt
of
self
in
which
she
had
maintained
that
the
individual
love
was
supreme
that
no
title
of
inferiority
became
it
she
saw
now
more
clearly
than
then
the
impossibility
of
distinguishing
those
two
motives
or
of
weighing
the
higher
and
the
lower
elements
of
her
love
one
way
there
was
and
one
way
only
of
proving
to
herself
that
she
had
not
fallen
below
the
worthiness
which
purest
love
demanded
that
she
had
indeed
offered
to
wilfrid
a
soul
whose
life
was
chastity
and
that
must
be
utterly
to
renounce
love
earthly
reward
and
in
spirit
to
be
faithful
to
him
while
her
life
lasted
the
pain
of
such
renunciation
was
twofold
for
did
she
not
visit
him
with
equal
affliction
had
she
the
right
to
do
that
the
question
was
importunate
and
she
held
it
a
temptation
of
her
weaker
self
wilfrid
would
bear
with
her
he
was
of
noble
nature
and
her
mere
assurance
of
a
supreme
duty
would
outweigh
his
personal
suffering
on
him
lay
no
obligation
of
faithfulness
to
his
first
love
a
man
with
the
world
before
him
he
would
as
was
right
find
another
to
share
his
life
to
think
that
was
no
light
test
of
steadfastness
in
emily
the
image
of
wilfrid
loving
and
loved
by
another
woman
wrung
the
sinews
of
her
heart
that
she
must
keep
from
her
mind
that
was
more
than
her
strength
could
face
and
conquer
it
should
be
enough
to
love
him
for
ever
without
hope
without
desire
faithfulness
would
cost
her
no
effort
to
purify
herself
in
ideal
devotion
would
be
her
sustenance
her
solace
what
of
her
religion
of
beauty
the
faith
which
had
seen
its
end
in
the
nourishment
of
every
instinct
demanding
loveliness
within
and
without
what
of
the
ideal
which
saw
the
crown
of
life
in
passion
triumphant
which
dreaded
imperfectness
which
allowed
the
claims
of
sense
equally
with
those
of
spirit
both
having
their
indispensable
part
in
the
complete
existence
had
it
not
conspicuously
failed
where
religion
should
be
most
efficient
she
understood
now
the
timidity
which
had
ever
lurked
behind
her
acceptance
of
that
view
of
life
she
had
never
been
able
entirely
to
divest
herself
of
the
feeling
that
her
exaltation
in
was
a
mood
born
of
sunny
days
that
it
would
fail
amid
shocks
of
misfortune
and
prove
a
mockery
in
the
hour
of
the
soul
dire
need
it
shared
in
the
unreality
of
her
life
in
wealthy
houses
amid
the
luxury
which
appertained
only
to
fortune
favourites
which
surrounded
her
only
by
chance
she
had
presumptuously
taken
to
herself
the
religion
of
her
superiors
of
those
to
whom
fate
allowed
the
assurance
of
peace
of
guarded
leisure
wherein
to
cultivate
the
richer
and
sweeter
flowers
of
their
nature
how
artificial
had
been
the
delights
with
which
she
soothed
herself
here
all
the
time
was
the
reality
here
in
this
poor
home
brooded
over
by
the
curse
of
poverty
whence
should
come
shame
and
woe
and
death
what
to
her
now
were
the
elegance
of
art
the
loveliness
of
nature
beauty
had
been
touched
by
mortality
and
its
hues
were
of
the
corpse
of
the
grave
would
the
music
of
a
verse
ever
again
fill
her
with
rapture
how
meaningless
were
all
such
toys
of
thought
to
one
whose
path
lay
through
the
valley
of
desolation
thus
did
emily
think
and
feel
in
this
sombre
season
the
passionate
force
of
her
imagination
making
itself
the
law
of
life
and
the
arbiter
of
her
destiny
she
could
not
take
counsel
with
time
her
temperament
knew
nothing
of
that
compromise
with
ardours
and
impulses
which
is
the
wisdom
of
disillusion
circumstances
willed
that
she
should
suffer
by
the
nobleness
of
her
instincts
those
endowments
which
might
in
a
happier
lot
have
exalted
her
to
such
perfection
of
calm
joy
as
humanity
may
attain
were
fated
to
be
the
source
of
misery

chapter
xvii
their
several
ways
as
wilfrid
quitted
the
house
the
gate
was
opened
by
jessie
cartwright
who
accompanied
by
one
of
her
sisters
was
bringing
emily
some
fine
grapes
purchased
in
the
cartwright
manner
without
regard
to
expense
the
girls
naturally
had
their
curiosity
excited
by
the
stranger
of
interesting
even
of
aristocratic
appearance
who
as
he
hurried
by
east
at
them
a
searching
look
who
ever
may
that
be
murmured
jessie
as
she
approached
the
door
doctor
i
dare
say
was
her
sister
suggestion
doctor
not
he
indeed
he
has
something
to
do
with
emily
depend
upon
it
the
servant
opening
to
them
had
to
report
that
miss
hood
was
too
unwell
to
receive
visitors
jessie
would
dearly
have
liked
to
ask
who
it
was
that
apparently
had
been
an
exception
but
even
she
lacked
the
assurance
necessary
to
the
putting
of
such
a
question
the
girls
left
their
offering
and
went
their
way
home
the
stranger
afforded
matter
for
conversation
throughout
the
walk
wilfrid
did
not
go
straight
to
the
baxendales
in
his
distracted
state
he
felt
it
impossible
to
sit
through
luncheon
and
he
could
not
immediately
decide
how
to
meet
baxendale
whether
to
take
her
into
his
confidence
or
to
preserve
silence
on
what
had
happened
he
was
not
sure
that
he
would
be
justified
in
disclosing
the
details
of
such
an
interview
did
he
not
owe
it
to
emily
to
refrain
from
submitting
her
action
to
the
judgment
of
any
third
person
if
in
truth
she
were
still
suffering
from
the
effects
of
her
illness
it
was
worse
than
unkind
to
repeat
her
words
if
on
the
other
hand
her
decision
came
of
adequate
motives
or
such
as
her
sound
intelligence
deemed
adequate
was
it
possible
to
violate
the
confidence
implied
in
such
a
conversation
between
her
and
himself
till
his
mind
had
assumed
some
degree
of
calmness
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
return
to
the
house
turning
from
the
main
road
at
a
point
just
before
the
bridge
over
the
river
he
kept
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
continued
walking
till
he
had
almost
made
the
circuit
of
dunfield
his
speed
was
that
of
a
man
who
hastened
with
some
express
object
his
limbs
seemed
spurred
to
activity
by
the
gallop
of
his
thoughts
his
reason
would
scarcely
accept
the
evidence
of
consciousness
that
he
had
indeed
just
heard
such
things
from
emily
lips
it
was
too
monstrous
for
belief
a
resolute
incredulity
sustained
him
beneath
a
blow
which
could
he
have
felt
it
to
be
meant
in
very
earnest
would
have
deprived
him
of
his
senses
she
did
not
she
could
not
know
what
she
had
said
yet
she
spoke
with
such
cruel
appearance
of
reasoning
earnestness
was
it
possible
for
a
diseased
mind
to
assume
so
convincingly
the
modes
of
rational
utterance
what
conceivable
circumstances
could
bring
her
to
such
a
resolution
her
words
do
not
love
you
made
horrible
repetition
in
his
ears
it
was
as
though
he
had
heard
her
speak
them
again
and
again
they
be
the
question
last
outcome
of
the
exercise
of
his
imagination
on
the
track
of
that
unimaginable
cause
brought
him
to
a
standstill
physically
and
mentally
those
words
had
at
first
scarcely
engaged
his
thought
it
was
her
request
to
be
released
that
seriously
concerned
him
that
falsehood
had
been
added
as
a
desperate
means
of
gaining
her
end
yet
now
all
other
explanations
in
vain
exhausted
perforce
he
gave
heed
to
that
hideous
chime
of
memory
it
was
not
her
father
death
that
caused
her
illness
that
she
admitted
had
some
horrible
complication
intervened
some
incredible
change
come
upon
her
since
he
left
england
he
shook
off
this
suggestion
as
blasphemy
emily
his
emily
upon
whose
faith
he
would
stake
the
breath
of
his
life
was
his
own
reason
failing
him
worn
out
he
reached
the
house
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
went
to
his
own
presently
a
servant
came
and
asked
whether
he
would
take
luncheon
he
declined
lying
on
the
sofa
he
still
tormented
himself
with
doubt
whether
he
might
speak
with
baxendale
that
lady
put
an
end
to
his
hesitation
by
herself
coming
to
his
room
he
sprang
up
move
do
move
she
exclaimed
in
her
cheery
way
have
only
come
to
ask
why
you
resolve
to
starve
yourself
you
ca
have
had
lunch
anywhere
i
am
not
hungry
headache
she
asked
looking
at
him
with
kind
shrewdness
little
perhaps
at
all
events
you
will
have
tea
may
i
ask
them
to
bring
it
here
she
went
away
and
a
few
minutes
after
her
return
tea
was
brought
found
emily
looking
sadly
i
afraid
she
said
with
one
of
the
provincialisms
which
occasionally
marked
her
language
wilfrid
replied
looked
far
too
ill
to
be
up
he
had
seated
himself
on
the
sofa
his
hands
would
not
hold
the
steadily
he
put
it
down
by
his
side
fear
there
is
small
chance
of
her
getting
much
better
in
that
house
of
illness
said
baxendale
observing
his
agitation
we
persuade
her
to
go
somewhere
her
mother
is
in
excellent
hands
wish
we
could
wilfrid
replied
clearly
without
much
attention
to
his
words
did
propose
anything
of
the
kind
he
made
no
answer
a
short
silence
intervened
and
he
felt
there
was
no
choice
but
to
declare
the
truth
meeting
was
a
very
painful
one
he
began
is
difficult
to
speak
to
you
about
it
do
you
think
that
she
has
perfectly
recovered
that
her
mind
is
wholly
he
hesitated
it
was
dreadful
to
be
speaking
in
this
way
of
emily
the
sound
of
his
voice
reproached
him
what
words
would
not
appear
brutal
in
such
a
case
fear
wilfrid
rose
and
walked
across
the
room
it
seemed
impossible
to
speak
yet
equally
so
to
keep
his
misery
to
himself
baxendale
he
said
at
length
am
perhaps
doing
a
very
wrong
thing
in
telling
you
what
passed
between
us
but
i
feel
quite
unable
to
decide
upon
any
course
without
the
aid
of
your
judgment
i
am
in
a
terrible
position
either
i
must
believe
emily
to
speak
without
responsibility
or
something
inexplicable
incredible
has
come
to
pass
she
has
asked
me
to
release
her
she
says
that
something
has
happened
which
makes
it
impossible
for
her
ever
to
fulfil
her
promise
something
which
must
always
remain
her
secret
which
i
may
not
hope
to
understand
and
with
such
dreadful
appearance
of
sincerity
such
a
face
of
awful
suffering
his
voice
failed
the
grave
concern
on
baxendale
visage
was
not
encouraging
happened
the
latter
repeated
in
astonishment
she
offer
no
kind
of
explanation
none
he
added
i
can
bring
myself
to
believe
baxendale
could
only
look
at
him
questioningly
said
wilfrid
continued
pale
with
the
effort
it
cost
him
to
speak
she
has
no
longer
any
affection
for
me
there
was
another
silence
of
longer
endurance
than
the
last
wilfrid
was
the
first
to
break
it
reason
for
refusing
to
believe
it
is
that
she
said
it
when
she
had
done
her
utmost
to
convince
me
of
her
earnestness
in
other
ways
and
said
it
in
a
way
how
is
it
possible
for
me
to
believe
it
it
is
only
two
months
since
i
saw
her
on
the
castle
hill
thought
you
had
never
been
here
before
have
never
spoken
to
you
of
that
i
came
and
left
on
the
same
day
it
was
to
see
her
before
i
went
to
switzerland
am
at
a
loss
said
baxendale
can
only
suggest
that
she
has
had
a
terrible
shock
and
that
her
recovery
or
seeming
recovery
has
been
too
rapid
yet
there
is
no
trace
of
wandering
in
her
talk
with
me
was
there
she
was
perfectly
rational
think
of
one
being
driven
to
hope
that
she
only
so
you
speak
of
correspondence
i
said
that
i
could
not
agree
to
what
she
asked
of
me
until
she
had
repeated
it
after
a
time
i
left
her
scarcely
knowing
what
i
spoke
what
shall
i
do
how
can
i
remain
in
doubt
such
as
this
i
said
i
wished
for
your
help
yet
how
can
you
how
can
anyone
help
me
have
i
unconsciously
been
the
cause
of
this
has
anyone
else
consciously
been
so
asked
the
lady
with
meaning
you
think
is
it
possible
only
hinted
that
your
relatives
were
not
altogether
pleased
wilfrid
a
light
of
anger
flashing
from
his
eyes
walked
rapidly
the
length
of
the
room
admitted
to
me
he
said
in
a
suppressed
voice
her
illness
began
before
her
father
death
it
was
not
that
that
caused
it
you
think
that
someone
may
have
interfered
my
father
impossible
he
is
a
man
of
honour
he
has
written
of
her
in
the
kindest
way
but
there
was
someone
else
his
father
was
honourable
could
the
same
be
said
of
rossall
he
remembered
his
conversation
with
her
on
the
lake
of
thun
it
had
left
an
unpleasant
impression
on
his
mind
under
the
circumstances
explicable
enough
was
his
aunt
capable
of
dastardly
behaviour
the
word
could
scarcely
be
applied
to
a
woman
conduct
and
the
fact
that
it
could
not
made
disagreeably
evident
the
latitude
conceded
to
women
in
consideration
of
their
being
compelled
to
carry
on
warfare
in
underhand
ways
suppose
an
anonymous
letter
would
not
rossall
regard
that
as
a
perfectly
legitimate
stratagem
if
she
had
set
her
mind
on
resisting
this
marriage
easy
infinitely
easy
was
it
to
believe
this
in
comparison
with
any
other
explanation
of
behaviour
in
his
haste
to
seize
on
a
credible
solution
of
the
difficulty
wilfrid
did
not
at
first
reflect
that
emily
was
a
very
unlikely
person
to
be
influenced
by
such
means
still
more
unlikely
that
she
should
keep
such
a
thing
secret
from
him
it
must
be
remembered
however
that
the
ways
of
treachery
are
manifold
and
the
idea
had
only
presented
it
to
his
mind
in
the
most
indefinite
form
as
it
was
it
drove
him
almost
to
frenzy
he
could
not
find
a
calm
word
nor
was
it
indeed
possible
to
communicate
to
baxendale
the
suspicion
which
occupied
him
she
watching
him
as
he
stood
at
a
distance
all
but
forgot
her
anxious
trouble
in
admiration
of
the
splendid
passion
which
had
transformed
his
features
wilfrid
looked
his
best
when
thus
stirred
his
best
from
a
woman
point
of
view
the
pale
cast
of
thought
was
far
from
him
you
saw
the
fiery
nature
asserting
itself
and
wondered
in
what
direction
these
energies
would
at
length
find
scope
baxendale
not
exactly
an
impressionable
woman
had
a
moment
of
here
and
sit
down
she
said
the
motherly
insistance
of
the
tone
possibly
revealing
her
former
thought
he
threw
himself
on
the
couch
course
she
continued
must
remain
between
emily
and
yourself
my
own
relations
to
her
must
be
precisely
as
they
have
been
as
if
i
had
heard
nothing
now
i
think
we
may
conclude
that
the
poor
girl
is
perfectly
aware
of
what
she
is
doing
but
i
no
more
than
yourself
believe
her
explanation
in
some
way
she
has
come
to
regard
it
as
a
duty
to
abandon
you
let
emily
once
think
it
a
duty
and
she
will
go
through
with
it
if
it
costs
her
life
so
much
i
know
of
her
so
much
it
is
easy
to
know
if
one
has
the
habit
of
observing
may
i
advise
you
do
not
try
to
see
her
again
but
write
briefly
asking
her
whether
the
mystery
she
spoke
of
in
any
way
connects
itself
with
you
you
will
know
how
to
put
it
so
as
to
exact
the
answer
you
require
suppose
you
write
such
a
note
at
once
i
will
send
it
as
soon
as
it
is
ready
you
are
in
the
torment
of
doubts
no
misery
as
bad
as
that
does
this
plan
recommend
itself
to
you
i
will
write
i
will
take
myself
off
whilst
you
do
so
ring
the
bell
and
send
for
me
as
soon
as
you
are
ready
it
is
only
four
emily
will
have
your
letter
in
an
hour
and
surely
will
reply
at
once
the
letter
was
written
at
greater
length
perhaps
than
was
quite
necessary
and
baxendale
speeded
it
on
its
way
wilfrid
begged
that
he
might
be
excused
from
attendance
at
the
all
means
was
baxendale
reply
more
so
that
we
have
politicians
again
and
i
fear
you
would
not
be
in
the
mood
to
make
fun
of
them
as
you
did
the
other
night
fun
of
them
no
i
was
in
earnest
i
got
interested
in
their
subjects
and
found
i
had
more
to
say
than
i
thought
well
that
is
your
politeness
now
lie
down
again
poor
boy
but
you
must
promise
to
cat
what
i
send
you
we
have
quite
enough
illness
on
our
hands
remember
may
have
the
answer
before
then
wilfrid
said
moodily
he
had
it
came
in
less
than
two
hours
from
the
messenger
departure
he
was
alone
when
the
servant
brought
it
to
him
emily
wrote
the
change
is
in
myself
in
my
heart
in
my
life
nothing
have
i
heard
against
you
nothing
have
i
imagined
against
you
the
influence
of
which
i
spoke
is
in
no
way
connected
with
you
let
this
i
implore
you
be
final
forgive
me
forgive
me
that
i
seem
to
inflict
pain
on
you
so
heedlessly
i
act
as
i
must
my
purpose
is
unchangeable
having
been
apprised
of
the
messenger
return
baxendale
entered
wilfrid
room
as
soon
as
she
had
dressed
for
dinner
he
sat
at
the
table
the
letter
lying
open
before
him
as
baxendale
approached
he
held
the
sheet
to
her
my
last
conjecture
is
fruitless
she
said
letting
her
hand
fall
can
not
doubt
her
word
it
no
there
is
nothing
for
me
but
to
believe
all
she
said
he
let
his
face
fall
upon
his
hands
the
bitterness
of
fate
was
entering
his
inmost
heart
no
you
shall
not
give
way
said
his
friend
just
touching
his
fingers
all
looks
very
sad
and
hopeless
but
i
will
not
believe
it
is
hopeless
refuse
to
believe
that
one
worst
thing
the
only
thing
for
which
there
is
no
remedy
come
defy
yourself
to
believe
it
you
are
strong
enough
for
that
there
is
manhood
in
you
for
anything
that
is
worth
bearing
however
hard
he
could
not
reply
to
her
encouragement
who
can
not
devise
words
of
exhortation
and
what
idler
than
such
words
when
the
heart
agonises
and
listen
to
me
wilfrid
if
i
make
you
angry
with
me
it
is
better
than
abandoning
yourself
to
despondency
i
firmly
believe
that
this
is
a
matter
which
time
will
bring
right
emily
is
acting
hastily
i
am
convinced
of
that
time
is
on
your
side
try
and
accept
him
as
a
friend
we
are
not
living
in
a
novel
there
are
no
such
things
as
mysteries
which
last
a
lifetime
your
part
is
to
draw
upon
all
the
manliness
you
own
to
have
faith
in
yourself
and
to
wait
have
faith
in
her
too
there
are
few
like
her
some
day
you
will
see
that
this
only
made
her
better
worth
now
answer
me
a
question
wilfrid
raised
his
head
you
not
in
your
heart
believe
that
she
is
incapable
of
folly
or
wrongheadedness
believe
that
no
truer
woman
lives
rightly
be
sure
of
it
believing
that
you
know
she
can
not
break
her
word
to
you
without
some
reason
which
you
would
yourself
say
was
good
and
sufficient
she
imagines
she
has
such
a
reason
imagines
it
in
all
sincerity
time
will
show
her
that
she
has
been
in
error
and
she
will
confess
it
she
has
all
her
faculties
no
doubt
but
a
trial
such
as
this
leads
her
to
see
things
in
ways
we
can
not
realise
forget
that
it
is
this
shock
that
has
so
affected
her
remember
that
her
father
death
is
itself
mysterious
she
may
know
more
of
what
led
to
it
than
anyone
else
does
she
may
very
well
have
foreseen
it
it
may
have
distracted
her
the
cause
whatever
it
was
she
could
not
disclose
anything
some
secret
perhaps
that
nearly
concerned
her
father
you
know
how
strong
were
the
ties
between
them
perhaps
it
was
inevitable
that
a
suggestion
of
this
kind
should
ultimately
offer
itself
wilfrid
had
not
hit
upon
the
idea
for
he
had
from
the
first
accepted
without
reflection
the
reasons
for
suicide
which
were
accepted
by
everyone
who
spoke
of
the
subject
baxendale
only
delivered
herself
of
the
thought
in
fervour
of
argument
she
paused
reviewing
it
in
her
mind
but
did
netlike
to
lay
more
stress
upon
it
wilfrid
also
thoughtful
kept
silence
there
the
gong
baxendale
continued
i
shall
have
to
go
to
the
politicians
but
i
think
i
given
you
a
grain
of
comfort
think
of
a
prosy
old
woman
inciting
to
endure
for
the
sake
of
the
greatest
prize
you
can
aim
at
keep
saying
to
yourself
that
emily
can
not
do
wrong
if
she
did
say
a
word
or
two
she
mean
well
well
we
poor
women
go
to
bed
early
and
we
talk
again
after
breakfast
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
hurried
away
even
in
his
wretchedness
wilfrid
could
not
but
follow
her
with
his
eyes
and
something
like
a
blessing
upon
her
strong
and
tender
womanhood
fortunate
fellow
who
had
laid
behind
him
thus
much
of
his
earthly
journey
without
one
day
of
grave
suffering
ah
something
he
should
have
sacrificed
to
the
envious
gods
some
lesser
joy
that
the
essential
happiness
of
his
life
might
be
spared
him
wilfrid
had
yet
to
learn
that
every
sun
which
rises
for
us
in
untroubled
sky
is
a
portent
of
inevitable
gloom
that
nature
only
prolongs
our
holiday
to
make
the
of
misery
the
harder
to
bear
he
had
enjoyed
the
way
of
his
will
from
childhood
upwards
he
had
come
to
regard
himself
as
exempt
from
even
as
he
was
exempt
from
the
degradation
of
material
need
all
his
doings
had
prospered
save
in
that
little
matter
of
his
overtaxed
health
and
it
had
grown
his
habit
to
map
the
future
with
a
generous
hand
saying
thus
and
thus
will
i
take
my
conquering
course
knowing
love
for
the
first
time
he
had
met
with
love
in
return
love
to
the
height
of
his
desire
and
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
he
had
swept
the
trivial
obstacles
from
his
path
now
that
the
very
sum
of
his
exultant
youth
offered
itself
like
a
to
his
lips
comes
forth
the
mysterious
hand
and
spills
relentlessly
that
divine
draught
see
how
he
turns
with
the
blaze
of
royal
indignation
on
his
brow
i
who
of
gods
or
men
has
dared
thus
to
come
between
him
and
his
bliss
he
is
not
wont
to
be
so
thwarted
he
demands
that
the
cup
shall
be
refilled
and
brought
again
only
when
mocking
laughter
echoes
round
him
when
it
is
but
too
plain
that
the
spirits
no
longer
serve
him
that
where
he
most
desires
his
power
is
least
does
his
resentment
change
by
cold
degrees
to
that
chill
anguish
of
the
abandoned
soul
which
pays
the
debt
of
so
many
an
hour
of
triumph
for
the
moment
words
of
kindness
and
sustaining
hope
might
seem
to
avail
him
but
there
is
the
night
waiting
in
ambush
for
his
weakness
that
season
of
the
sun
silence
when
the
body
denuded
of
vestment
typifies
the
spirit
exposure
to
its
enemies
let
him
live
through
his
trial
in
that
of
ancient
darkness
he
will
not
come
forth
a
better
man
though
perchance
a
wiser
wisdom
and
goodness
are
from
of
old
at
issue
henceforth
he
will
have
eyes
for
many
an
ugly
spot
in
his
own
nature
hidden
till
now
by
the
veil
of
happiness
do
not
pity
him
congratulate
him
rather
that
the
inevitable
has
been
so
long
postponed
he
put
on
a
bold
face
at
breakfast
next
morning
for
he
could
not
suppose
that
baxendale
would
feel
any
obligation
to
keep
his
secret
from
her
husband
and
it
was
not
in
his
character
to
play
the
knight
of
the
dolorous
visage
you
saw
the
rings
round
his
eyes
but
he
was
able
to
discuss
the
latest
electioneering
intelligence
and
even
to
utter
one
or
two
more
of
those
shrewd
remarks
by
which
he
had
lately
been
proving
that
politics
were
not
unlikely
to
demand
more
of
his
attention
some
day
but
he
was
glad
when
he
could
get
away
to
the
to
await
baxendale
coming
he
tried
to
read
in
a
volume
of
boswell
which
lay
out
at
other
times
the
book
was
his
delight
now
it
had
the
succulence
of
a
piece
of
straw
he
was
in
that
state
of
mind
when
five
minutes
of
waiting
is
intolerable
he
had
to
wait
some
twenty
before
baxendale
appeared
only
a
clinging
remnant
of
kept
him
from
addressing
her
sourly
wilfrid
was
not
eminently
patient
what
counsel
has
sleep
brought
she
asked
speaking
as
if
she
had
some
other
matter
on
her
mind
as
indeed
she
had
a
slight
difficulty
which
had
just
arisen
with
the
cook
should
not
be
much
advanced
if
i
had
depended
upon
sleep
wilfrid
replied
cheerlessly
always
sensitive
he
was
especially
so
at
this
moment
and
the
lady
seemed
to
him
unsympathetic
he
should
have
allowed
for
the
hour
matters
involving
sentiment
should
never
be
touched
till
the
day
has
grown
to
ripeness
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
a
poet
is
capable
of
mathematics
fear
you
are
not
the
only
one
who
has
not
slept
said
baxendale
wilfrid
after
waiting
in
vain
went
on
in
a
tone
very
strange
to
him
do
know
what
to
do
i
am
incapable
of
thought
another
night
like
the
last
will
drive
me
mad
you
tell
me
i
must
merely
wait
but
i
can
not
be
passive
what
help
is
there
how
can
i
kill
the
time
baxendale
was
visibly
harder
than
on
the
previous
evening
a
caused
her
to
draw
in
her
lips
she
played
with
the
at
her
girdle
fear
she
said
have
done
all
that
can
be
done
naturally
you
would
find
it
intolerable
to
linger
here
must
return
to
london
any
other
circumstances
i
should
be
the
last
to
wish
it
but
i
suppose
it
is
better
that
you
should
he
was
prepared
for
the
advice
but
unreason
strove
in
him
desperately
against
the
facts
of
the
situation
it
was
this
impotent
quarrel
with
necessity
which
robbed
him
of
his
natural
initiative
and
made
baxendale
wonder
at
his
unexpected
feebleness
to
him
it
seemed
something
to
stand
his
ground
even
for
a
few
minutes
he
could
have
eased
himself
with
angry
speech
remember
that
he
had
not
slept
and
that
his
mind
was
sore
with
the
adversary
blows
understand
your
reluctance
baxendale
pursued
like
a
surrendering
of
hope
but
you
know
what
i
said
last
night
i
could
only
repeat
the
same
things
now
do
be
afraid
i
will
not
he
murmured
must
go
to
london
would
be
far
worse
if
you
had
no
friend
here
you
shall
hear
from
me
constantly
you
have
an
assurance
that
the
poor
thing
ca
run
away
in
the
expressive
vulgar
phrase
wilfrid
himself
together
he
began
to
perceive
that
his
attitude
lacked
dignity
even
in
our
misery
we
can
not
bear
to
appear
ignoble
will
leave
you
he
said
more
like
his
old
self
there
are
other
things
that
we
must
speak
of
what
of
emily
practical
position
do
think
we
need
trouble
about
that
baxendale
tells
me
he
has
no
doubt
that
the
house
in
barnhill
can
be
sold
at
all
events
for
a
sum
that
will
leave
them
at
ease
for
the
present
as
soon
as
mrs
hood
gets
better
they
must
both
go
away
you
can
trust
me
to
do
what
can
be
done
is
my
fear
that
emily
will
find
it
difficult
to
accept
your
kindness
will
require
tact
only
experience
can
show
what
my
course
must
be
sincerely
hope
the
house
be
sold
otherwise
the
outlook
is
deplorable
assure
you
it
will
be
my
husband
does
not
give
up
anything
he
has
once
put
his
hand
to
shall
keep
my
own
counsel
at
home
wilfrid
said
so
certainly
and
you
will
return
to
oxford
think
so
i
shall
find
it
easier
to
live
there
if
indeed
i
can
live
anywhere
had
rather
you
had
added
that
said
baxendale
with
reproof
know
that
you
will
only
work
the
harder
just
to
forget
your
trouble
that
depend
upon
it
is
the
only
way
of
killing
the
time
as
you
said
if
we
strike
at
him
in
other
ways
we
only
succeed
in
making
him
angry
apophthegm
said
wilfrid
with
an
attempt
at
brightness
are
the
first
woman
i
have
known
who
has
that
gift
of
neatness
in
speech
you
are
the
first
man
who
ever
had
discernment
enough
to
compliment
me
on
it
after
that
do
you
think
i
shall
desert
your
cause
wilfrid
made
his
preparations
forthwith
and
decided
upon
a
train
early
in
the
afternoon
at
luncheon
baxendale
was
full
of
regrets
that
his
visit
could
not
be
prolonged
till
the
time
of
the
election
now
very
near
your
constituents
have
sent
you
to
westminster
said
wilfrid
hope
you
will
come
and
report
to
me
the
details
of
the
fight
so
he
covered
his
retreat
and
retrieved
in
baxendale
eyes
his
weakness
of
the
morning
she
took
him
to
the
station
in
her
brougham
but
did
not
go
on
to
the
platform
their
parting
was
very
like
that
of
lovers
for
it
ended
with
mutual
promises
to
often
baxendale
was
as
she
drove
home
in
her
a
most
unusual
thing
two
days
later
she
went
to
banbrigg
carrying
the
satisfactory
news
that
at
last
a
sale
of
the
barnhill
property
had
been
negotiated
to
emily
this
intelligence
gave
extreme
relief
it
restored
her
independence
having
this
subject
to
speak
of
made
the
meeting
easier
on
both
sides
than
it
could
otherwise
have
been
emily
was
restlessly
anxious
to
take
upon
herself
the
task
of
nursing
her
mother
with
the
maid
to
help
her
she
declared
herself
able
to
bear
all
responsibilities
and
persisted
so
strongly
that
baxendale
had
no
choice
but
to
assent
to
the
nurse
who
had
remained
being
withdrawn
she
could
understand
the
need
of
activity
which
possessed
the
girl
but
had
grave
fears
of
the
result
of
an
undertaking
so
disproportioned
to
her
strength
you
promise
me
she
said
give
it
up
and
get
help
if
you
find
it
is
trying
you
excessively
emily
replied
will
promise
that
but
i
know
i
shall
be
better
for
the
occupation
you
will
let
me
still
come
and
see
you
frequently
should
miss
you
very
much
if
you
ceased
to
was
emily
answer
both
felt
that
a
difficulty
had
been
surmounted
though
they
looked
at
it
from
different
sides
october
passed
and
the
first
half
of
november
mrs
hood
had
not
risen
from
her
bed
and
there
seemed
slight
chance
that
she
ever
would
she
was
sinking
into
hopeless
imbecility
emily
task
in
that
was
one
which
a
hospital
nurse
would
have
found
it
burdensome
to
support
she
bore
it
without
a
sign
of
weariness
or
of
failure
in
physical
strength
incessant
companionship
with
bodily
disease
was
the
least
oppressive
of
her
burdens
the
state
of
her
mother
mind
afflicted
her
far
more
occasionally
the
invalid
would
appear
in
full
possession
of
her
intellect
and
those
were
the
hardest
days
at
such
times
she
was
incessantly
querulous
hours
long
she
lay
and
poured
forth
complaints
and
reproaches
when
she
could
speak
no
more
for
very
weariness
she
moaned
and
wept
till
emily
also
found
it
impossible
to
check
the
tears
which
came
of
the
extremity
of
her
compassion
the
girl
was
superhuman
in
her
patience
never
did
she
speak
a
word
which
was
not
of
perfect
gentleness
the
bitterest
misery
seemed
but
to
augment
the
tenderness
of
her
devotion
scarcely
was
there
an
hour
of
the
day
or
night
that
she
could
claim
for
herself
whilst
it
was
daylight
she
tended
the
sufferer
ceaselessly
and
her
bed
was
in
the
same
room
so
that
it
often
happened
that
she
lay
down
only
to
rise
before
she
could
sleep
her
task
was
lighter
when
her
mother
mind
strayed
from
the
present
but
even
then
mrs
hood
talked
constantly
and
was
irritated
if
emily
failed
in
attention
the
usual
subject
was
her
happiness
in
the
days
before
her
marriage
she
would
revive
memories
of
her
school
give
long
accounts
of
her
pupils
even
speak
of
proposals
of
marriage
which
she
had
had
the
pleasure
of
declining
at
no
time
did
she
refer
to
hood
death
but
often
enough
she
uttered
lamentations
over
the
hardships
in
which
her
marriage
had
resulted
and
compared
her
lot
with
what
it
might
have
been
if
she
had
chosen
this
or
that
other
man
emily
was
pained
unspeakably
by
this
revelation
of
her
mother
nature
for
she
knew
that
it
was
idle
to
explain
such
tendencies
of
thought
as
the
effect
of
disease
it
was
in
truth
only
the
emphasising
of
the
faults
she
had
always
found
it
so
hard
to
bear
with
she
could
not
understand
the
absence
of
a
single
note
of
affection
or
sorrow
in
all
these
utterances
and
the
fact
was
indeed
strange
bearing
in
mind
mrs
hood
outburst
of
loving
grief
when
her
husband
was
brought
home
and
the
devotedness
she
had
shown
throughout
emily
illness
were
the
selfish
habits
of
years
too
strong
for
those
better
instincts
which
had
never
found
indulgence
till
stirred
by
the
supreme
shock
thinking
over
the
problem
in
infinite
sadness
this
was
the
interpretation
with
which
emily
had
to
satisfy
herself
and
she
saw
in
it
the
most
dreadful
punishment
which
a
fault
could
have
entailed
though
to
her
mother
so
sublimely
forbearing
in
her
heart
she
knew
too
well
the
bitterness
of
revolt
against
nature
cruelty
her
own
causes
of
suffering
became
almost
insignificant
in
her
view
of
the
tragedy
of
life
was
not
this
calamity
upon
her
surviving
parent
again
a
result
of
her
own
action
was
it
possible
to
avoid
a
comparison
between
this
blasted
home
and
the
appearance
it
might
at
this
moment
have
presented
if
she
had
sacrificed
herself
what
crime
had
she
ever
been
guilty
of
that
such
expiation
could
be
demanded
of
her
she
mocked
at
her
misery
for
so
questioning
as
if
causes
and
effects
were
to
be
thus
discerned
in
fate
dealings
emily
had
never
known
the
phase
of
faith
which
finds
comfort
in
the
confession
of
native
corruptness
nor
did
the
desolation
of
her
life
guide
her
into
that
orthodox
form
of
pessimism
she
was
not
conscious
of
impurity
and
her
healthy
human
intelligence
could
only
see
injustice
in
the
woe
that
had
befallen
her
from
her
childhood
up
she
had
striven
towards
the
light
had
loved
all
that
is
beautiful
had
worshipped
righteousness
out
of
this
had
it
issued
that
her
life
was
sunk
in
woe
unfathomable
hopeless
of
rescue
for
ever
she
was
the
sacrifice
of
others
the
of
one
man
the
thoughtless
error
of
another
had
brought
this
upon
her
her
character
like
the
elemental
forces
of
earth
converted
to
beneficent
energy
the
burden
of
corruption
thrust
upon
it
active
at
first
because
she
dreaded
the
of
idleness
she
found
in
her
labour
and
her
endurance
sources
of
stern
inspiration
her
indestructible
idealism
grasped
at
the
core
of
spiritual
beauty
in
a
life
even
such
as
this
she
did
not
reason
with
herself
hysterically
of
evil
passions
to
be
purified
by
asceticism
of
mysterious
iniquities
to
be
washed
out
in
her
very
life
blood
but
the
great
principles
of
devotion
and
renunciation
became
soothing
and
exalting
presences
before
which
the
details
of
her
daily
task
lost
their
toilsome
or
revolting
aspect
in
a
hallowed
purpose
her
work
was
a
work
of
piety
not
only
to
the
living
but
to
the
beloved
dead
if
her
father
could
know
of
what
she
was
now
doing
he
would
be
comforted
by
it
if
he
knew
that
she
did
it
for
his
sake
it
would
bring
him
happiness
this
truth
she
saw
that
though
life
be
stripped
of
every
outward
charm
there
may
yet
remain
in
the
heart
of
it
like
a
glorious
light
that
which
is
the
source
of
all
beauty
love
she
strove
to
make
love
the
essence
of
her
being
her
mother
whom
it
was
so
hard
to
cherish
for
her
own
sake
she
would
and
could
love
because
her
father
had
done
so
that
father
whose
only
existence
now
was
in
her
own
she
loved
with
fervour
which
seemed
to
grow
daily
supreme
fostered
by
these
other
affections
exalted
by
the
absence
of
a
single
hope
for
self
reigned
the
first
and
last
love
of
her
every
hard
task
achieved
for
love
sake
rendered
her
in
thought
more
worthy
of
him
whom
she
made
the
ideal
man
he
would
never
know
of
the
passion
which
she
perfected
to
be
her
eternal
support
but
as
there
is
a
sense
of
sweetness
in
the
thought
that
we
may
be
held
dear
by
some
who
can
neither
come
near
us
nor
make
known
to
us
their
so
did
it
seem
to
emily
that
from
her
love
would
go
forth
a
secret
influence
and
that
wilfrid
all
unknowing
would
be
blest
by
her
faithfulness
chapter
xviii
a
compact
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
a
sunday
dagworthy
sat
by
his
fireside
alone
luncheon
had
been
removed
and
decanters
stood
within
his
reach
but
the
glass
of
wine
which
he
had
poured
out
on
turning
to
the
fire
half
an
hour
ago
was
still
untasted
the
cigar
of
which
he
had
cut
the
end
was
still
between
his
fingers
unlighted
for
the
last
three
months
our
friend
had
not
lacked
matter
for
thought
to
do
him
justice
he
had
exercised
his
mind
upon
it
pretty
constantly
he
had
received
news
which
gave
a
fresh
impulse
to
his
rumination
dagworthy
had
never
since
the
years
of
early
manhood
cared
much
for
any
of
the
various
kinds
of
society
open
to
him
in
dunfield
and
his
failure
to
show
himself
at
the
houses
of
his
acquaintance
for
weeks
together
occasioned
no
comment
but
during
these
past
three
months
he
had
held
so
persistently
aloof
that
people
had
at
length
begun
to
ask
for
an
explanation
at
all
events
when
the
end
of
the
political
turmoil
gave
them
leisure
to
think
of
minor
matters
once
more
the
triumphant
return
of
baxendale
had
naturally
led
to
festive
occasions
at
one
dinner
at
the
baxendales
house
dagworthy
was
present
but
as
it
seemed
in
the
body
only
people
who
in
the
provincial
way
made
old
jokes
last
a
very
long
time
remarked
to
each
other
with
a
smile
that
dagworthy
appeared
to
be
in
a
mood
which
promised
an
item
of
interest
in
the
police
reports
before
long
one
person
there
was
who
had
special
reason
for
observing
him
closely
that
evening
and
even
for
inducing
him
to
converse
on
certain
subjects
this
was
baxendale
a
day
or
two
previously
she
had
heard
a
singular
story
from
a
friend
of
hers
which
occupied
her
thought
not
a
little
it
interested
her
to
discover
how
dagworthy
would
speak
of
the
hood
family
if
led
to
that
topic
he
did
not
seem
to
care
to
dwell
upon
it
and
the
lady
after
her
experiment
imagined
that
it
had
not
been
made
altogether
in
vain
with
that
exception
dagworthy
had
kept
to
his
mill
and
his
house
it
was
seldom
that
he
had
a
visitor
and
those
persons
who
did
call
could
hardly
feel
that
they
were
desired
to
come
again
jenkins
of
the
done
tongue
ruled
in
the
household
and
had
but
brief
interviews
with
her
master
provided
that
his
meals
were
served
at
the
proper
time
dagworthy
cared
to
inquire
into
nothing
that
went
on
outside
his
kennels
and
even
those
he
visited
in
a
sullen
way
his
child
he
scarcely
saw
jenkins
discovered
that
to
bring
the
into
its
father
presence
was
a
sure
occasion
of
wrath
so
the
son
and
heir
took
lessons
in
his
native
tongue
from
the
housekeeper
and
her
dependents
and
profited
by
their
instruction
dagworthy
never
inquired
about
the
boy
health
once
when
jenkins
alarmed
by
certain
symptoms
of
infantine
disorder
ventured
to
enter
the
and
broach
the
subject
her
master
reply
was
for
the
doctor
then
ca
you
he
had
formerly
made
a
sort
of
plaything
of
the
child
when
in
the
mood
for
it
now
he
was
not
merely
indifferent
the
sight
of
the
boy
angered
him
his
return
home
was
a
signal
for
the
closing
of
all
doors
between
his
room
and
the
remote
nursery
once
when
he
heard
crying
he
had
summoned
jenkins
you
ca
stop
that
noise
he
said
keep
it
out
of
my
hearing
i
send
the
child
to
be
taken
care
of
in
hebsworth
or
somewhere
else
further
off
and
then
i
shut
up
the
house
and
send
you
all
about
your
business
so
just
mind
what
i
say
of
late
it
had
become
known
that
he
was
about
to
take
a
partner
into
his
business
a
member
of
the
legge
family
a
name
we
remember
dunfieldians
discussed
the
news
and
revived
their
pleasure
in
speculating
on
the
sum
total
of
dagworthy
fortune
but
it
was
as
one
talks
of
possible
mines
of
treasure
in
the
moon
practical
interest
in
the
question
could
scarcely
be
said
to
exist
for
the
chance
of
dagworthy
remarriage
seemed
remoter
than
ever
the
man
was
beginning
to
be
one
of
those
figures
about
whom
gathers
the
peculiar
air
of
mystery
which
ultimately
leads
to
the
creation
of
myths
let
him
live
on
in
this
way
for
another
twenty
years
and
stories
would
be
told
of
him
to
children
in
the
nursery
the
case
of
assault
and
battery
a
thing
of
the
far
past
would
probably
develop
into
a
fable
of
manslaughter
of
murder
his
death
was
already
regarded
very
much
in
that
light
and
would
class
him
with
bluebeard
his
house
on
the
heath
would
assume
a
forbidding
aspect
and
dread
whispers
would
be
exchanged
of
what
went
on
there
under
the
shadow
of
night
was
it
not
already
beginning
to
be
remarked
by
his
neighbours
that
you
met
him
wandering
about
lonely
places
at
unholy
hours
and
that
he
shunned
you
like
one
with
a
guilty
conscience
let
him
advance
in
years
his
face
lose
its
broad
colour
his
hair
grow
scant
and
grey
his
figure
per
chance
stoop
a
little
his
eyes
acquire
the
malignity
of
miserly
old
age
and
there
you
have
the
hero
of
a
dunfield
legend
even
thus
do
such
grow
but
he
is
sitting
by
his
fireside
this
new
year
eve
still
a
young
man
still
only
looking
tired
and
lonely
and
in
fact
meditating
an
attempt
to
recover
his
interest
in
life
he
had
admitted
a
partner
to
his
business
chiefly
that
he
might
be
free
to
quit
yorkshire
for
a
time
and
at
present
he
was
settling
affairs
to
that
end
this
afternoon
he
expected
a
visit
from
cartwright
who
had
been
serving
him
in
several
ways
of
late
and
who
had
promised
to
come
and
talk
business
for
an
hour
the
day
was
anything
but
cheerful
at
times
a
stray
flake
of
snow
hissed
upon
the
fire
already
at
three
shadows
were
invading
the
room
he
heard
a
knock
at
the
front
door
and
supposing
it
to
be
cartwright
roused
himself
as
he
was
stirring
the
fire
a
servant
announced
instead
of
the
father
the
daughter
jessie
cartwright
appeared
amiss
with
your
father
dagworthy
asked
shaking
hands
with
her
carelessly
i
sorry
to
say
he
has
such
a
very
bad
that
he
could
possibly
come
oh
what
an
afternoon
it
is
to
be
sure
did
come
was
dagworthy
not
very
polite
inquiry
was
so
important
as
all
that
walked
all
the
way
course
i
afraid
the
wet
drip
off
my
cloak
on
to
the
floor
it
off
then
and
put
it
here
by
the
fire
to
dry
he
helped
her
to
divest
herself
and
hung
the
cloak
on
to
the
back
of
a
chair
may
as
well
sit
down
shall
i
give
you
a
glass
of
wine
indeed
no
no
thank
you
think
you
better
have
one
he
said
without
heeding
her
suppose
you
got
your
feet
wet
i
ca
very
well
ask
you
to
take
your
shoes
off
they
not
wet
anything
to
speak
of
said
jessie
settling
herself
in
a
chair
as
if
her
visit
were
the
most
ordinary
event
she
watched
him
pour
the
wine
putting
on
the
face
of
a
child
who
is
going
to
be
treated
to
something
reserved
for
persons
do
they
mean
by
sending
you
all
this
distance
in
such
weather
dagworthy
said
as
he
seated
himself
and
extended
his
legs
resting
an
elbow
on
the
table
did
send
me
i
offered
to
come
and
mother
would
hear
of
it
i
just
slipped
out
of
the
room
and
was
off
before
anyone
could
get
after
me
i
suppose
i
shall
catch
it
rarely
when
i
get
back
but
we
wanted
to
know
why
you
have
been
to
see
us
not
even
on
christmas
day
now
that
you
know
was
too
bad
of
you
dagworthy
i
said
you
must
be
have
you
been
no
the
girl
exclaimed
upon
a
sudden
thought
reminds
me
i
really
believe
mrs
hood
is
dead
at
all
events
all
the
blinds
were
down
as
i
came
past
was
the
reply
is
dead
she
died
early
this
morning
i
never
is
poor
emily
having
a
shocking
christmas
i
declare
when
i
saw
her
last
week
she
looked
like
a
ghost
and
worse
dagworthy
gazed
at
the
fire
and
said
nothing
ca
be
sorry
that
it
over
jessie
went
on
it
so
dreadful
her
father
and
mother
dead
almost
at
the
same
time
i
sure
it
would
have
killed
me
is
she
going
to
do
dagworthy
asked
slowly
almost
as
if
speaking
to
himself
i
daresay
it
be
all
right
as
soon
as
she
gets
over
it
you
know
she
a
lucky
girl
in
one
way
he
raised
his
head
to
regard
her
well
that
is
a
thing
to
talk
about
and
then
i
do
know
anything
for
certain
it
only
what
people
say
you
know
do
people
say
he
asked
impatiently
though
without
much
sign
of
active
interest
it
was
rather
as
if
her
manner
annoyed
him
than
the
subject
of
which
she
spoke
do
see
that
it
can
interest
you
i
do
see
that
it
can
still
you
may
as
well
explain
jessie
sipped
her
wine
only
that
they
say
she
engaged
whom
gentleman
in
london
somebody
in
the
family
where
she
was
teaching
do
you
know
that
he
asked
with
the
same
blending
of
indifference
and
annoyed
persistency
it
only
a
guess
after
all
one
day
barbara
and
i
went
to
see
her
and
just
as
we
got
to
the
door
out
comes
a
gentleman
we
never
seen
before
of
course
we
wondered
who
he
was
the
next
day
mother
and
i
were
in
the
station
buying
a
newspaper
and
there
was
the
same
gentleman
just
going
to
start
by
the
london
train
mother
remembered
she
seen
him
walking
with
baxendale
in
luke
and
then
we
found
he
been
staying
with
the
baxendales
all
through
illness
did
you
find
it
out
you
do
know
the
baxendales
but
gadd
does
and
she
told
us
his
name
athel
a
queer
name
is
it
dagworthy
was
silent
you
cross
with
me
jessie
exclaimed
tell
me
like
you
did
once
before
that
i
no
good
but
to
pry
into
other
business
may
pry
as
much
as
you
like
was
the
murmured
reply
because
you
do
care
what
i
do
your
wine
and
try
to
be
quiet
just
for
a
little
he
made
no
answer
until
jessie
asked
does
it
seem
to
interest
you
so
much
all
that
stuff
you
been
telling
me
i
was
thinking
of
something
quite
different
exclaimed
the
girl
blankly
there
was
a
longer
silence
jessie
let
her
eyes
stray
about
the
room
stealing
a
glance
at
dagworthy
occasionally
presently
he
rose
poked
the
fire
with
violence
and
drank
his
own
wine
which
had
been
waiting
so
long
must
have
out
the
carriage
to
send
you
back
he
said
going
to
the
window
to
look
at
the
foul
weather
carriage
indeed
protested
the
girl
with
a
secret
joy
do
no
such
thing
suppose
i
shall
do
as
i
choose
he
remarked
quietly
then
he
came
and
rang
the
bell
not
really
going
to
a
servant
answered
and
the
carriage
was
ordered
certainly
that
one
way
of
getting
rid
of
me
jessie
observed
can
stay
as
long
as
you
please
the
carriage
will
be
round
i
keep
it
waiting
half
through
the
night
if
i
choose
i
done
so
before
now
i
suppose
i
master
in
my
own
house
it
was
strictly
true
that
of
the
carriage
once
the
coachman
had
been
five
minutes
late
on
an
evening
when
dagworthy
happened
to
be
he
bade
the
man
wait
at
the
door
and
the
waiting
lasted
through
several
hours
the
room
was
growing
dusk
you
very
lonely
here
jessie
asked
an
indescribable
change
in
her
voice
i
suppose
i
am
you
wo
make
it
any
better
by
telling
me
so
feel
sorry
dare
say
you
do
course
you
do
believe
me
all
the
same
i
feel
sorry
wo
help
i
suppose
it
wo
the
words
were
breathed
out
on
a
sigh
dagworthy
made
no
answer
not
much
better
off
she
continued
in
a
voice
he
ejaculated
roughly
half
turning
his
back
on
her
jessie
fumbled
a
moment
at
her
dress
then
succeeding
in
getting
her
handkerchief
out
began
to
press
it
against
her
eyes
furtively
strangely
there
was
real
moisture
to
be
removed
the
matter
with
you
dagworthy
asked
with
surprise
she
no
longer
attempted
concealment
but
began
to
cry
quietly
the
deuce
has
come
to
you
jessie
you
speak
very
unkindly
to
me
she
sobbed
unkindly
i
did
know
it
what
did
i
say
wo
believe
when
i
say
i
sorry
you
feel
lonely
confound
it
i
believe
as
much
as
you
like
if
it
comes
to
that
put
that
handkerchief
away
and
drink
another
glass
of
wine
she
stood
up
and
went
to
lean
on
the
mantelpiece
hiding
her
face
when
he
was
near
her
again
she
continued
her
complaints
in
a
low
voice
so
miserable
at
home
they
want
me
to
be
a
teacher
and
how
can
i
i
never
pretended
to
be
clever
and
if
i
all
the
lessons
under
the
sun
i
should
never
be
able
to
teach
french
and
arithmetic
and
those
things
but
i
wish
i
could
then
i
should
get
away
from
home
and
see
new
people
there
nobody
i
care
to
see
in
dunfield
nobody
but
one
she
stopped
on
a
sob
that
dagworthy
asked
looking
at
her
with
a
singular
expression
from
head
to
foot
she
made
no
answer
but
sobbed
again
christmas
presents
have
you
had
was
his
next
question
irrelevant
enough
apparently
none
none
to
speak
of
a
few
little
things
what
do
i
care
for
presents
you
ca
live
on
presents
live
on
them
are
things
bad
at
home
did
mean
that
but
of
course
they
bad
they
always
bad
nowadays
however
barbara
going
to
be
married
in
a
week
she
be
one
out
of
the
way
and
of
course
i
have
a
dress
fit
to
be
seen
in
for
the
wedding
then
get
a
dress
how
much
will
it
cost
he
went
to
a
unlocked
a
drawer
and
took
out
a
then
he
said
half
jestingly
half
in
earnest
is
it
to
be
anything
you
like
to
say
i
write
it
if
i
wanted
money
can
give
you
that
i
do
see
what
else
i
can
do
it
is
to
be
despised
you
can
do
nothing
else
she
said
pressing
each
cheek
with
her
handkerchief
before
putting
it
away
you
help
me
on
with
my
cloak
mr
dagworthy
he
took
it
from
the
chair
and
held
it
for
her
jessie
as
if
by
accident
approached
her
face
to
his
hand
and
before
he
saw
her
purpose
kissed
his
hard
fingers
then
she
turned
away
hiding
her
face
dagworthy
dropped
the
garment
and
stood
looking
at
her
he
had
a
half
contemptuous
smile
on
his
lips
at
this
moment
it
was
announced
that
the
carriage
was
coming
round
jessie
caught
at
her
cloak
and
threw
it
over
her
shoulders
then
with
sunk
head
she
offered
to
shake
hands
use
jessie
dagworthy
remarked
quietly
without
answering
her
gesture
course
i
know
it
no
use
she
said
in
a
hurried
voice
of
shame
know
it
as
well
as
you
can
tell
me
i
wish
i
never
come
you
do
act
badly
he
continued
do
you
mean
she
exclaimed
indignation
helping
her
to
raise
her
eyes
for
a
moment
not
acting
do
mean
anything
by
it
that
all
perhaps
not
i
going
away
before
very
long
i
dare
say
i
sha
see
you
again
before
then
are
you
going
to
suppose
you
bring
back
a
foreign
wife
she
said
with
sad
scornfulness
i
not
likely
to
do
that
i
should
wonder
if
i
away
for
some
time
though
perhaps
a
couple
of
years
she
exclaimed
in
astonishment
he
laughed
startles
you
i
sha
be
back
in
time
for
your
wedding
you
see
she
sobbed
again
averting
her
face
sha
ever
be
married
i
one
of
those
wretched
things
nobody
ever
cares
for
have
to
show
you
deserve
it
why
you
could
give
your
word
and
keep
it
for
two
years
through
this
extraordinary
scene
dagworthy
was
utterly
unlike
himself
it
was
as
if
a
man
suffering
physical
agony
should
suddenly
begin
to
jest
and
utter
wild
mirth
there
was
the
same
unreality
in
his
behaviour
throughout
it
all
the
lines
of
his
face
never
lost
their
impress
of
gloom
misery
had
its
clutch
upon
him
and
he
was
driven
by
an
inexplicable
spirit
of
to
burlesque
the
subject
of
his
unhappiness
he
had
no
sense
of
responsibility
and
certain
instincts
were
strongly
excited
making
a
kind
of
moral
intoxication
jessie
answered
his
question
with
wide
eyes
could
ah
she
spoke
under
her
breath
and
with
sincerity
which
was
not
a
little
amusing
new
year
eve
is
it
dagworthy
pursued
throwing
out
his
words
at
random
here
this
day
two
years
or
not
as
you
like
going
to
wander
about
but
i
shall
be
here
on
that
day
that
is
if
alive
you
wo
though
he
turned
away
from
her
and
went
to
the
jessie
moved
a
little
nearer
you
mean
that
she
asked
it
he
repeated
yes
as
much
as
i
mean
anything
be
off
you
keeping
that
poor
devil
in
the
snow
dagworthy
i
shall
be
here
and
you
dare
pretend
to
forget
or
to
say
you
were
in
earnest
he
laughed
and
waved
his
hand
off
to
your
carriage
jessie
moved
to
the
door
reluctantly
but
he
did
not
turn
again
and
she
departed
chapter
xix
the
completion
of
mischance
upon
emily
had
fallen
silence
the
tongue
which
for
three
months
had
incessantly
sounded
in
her
ears
with
its
notes
of
wailing
of
upbraiding
of
physical
pain
of
meaningless
misery
was
at
rest
for
ever
as
she
stood
beside
the
grave
the
grave
whose
earth
had
not
had
time
to
harden
since
it
received
her
father
she
seemed
still
to
hear
that
feeble
querulous
voice
with
its
perpetual
iteration
of
her
own
name
the
casting
of
clay
upon
the
coffin
made
a
sound
not
half
so
real
returning
home
she
went
up
to
the
bedroom
with
the
same
hurried
step
with
which
she
had
been
wont
to
enter
after
her
brief
absences
the
bed
was
vacant
the
blind
made
the
air
dim
she
saw
her
breath
rise
before
her
there
remained
but
a
little
who
coming
to
the
to
ask
about
meals
stood
crying
with
her
apron
held
to
her
eyes
emily
spoke
to
her
almost
with
tender
kindness
her
own
eyes
had
shed
but
few
tears
she
only
wept
on
hearing
those
passages
read
which
by
their
promise
of
immortal
life
were
to
her
as
mockery
of
her
grief
she
did
not
venture
to
look
into
the
grave
mouth
she
dreaded
lest
there
might
be
visible
some
portion
of
her
father
coffin
baxendale
the
cartwrights
and
one
or
two
other
friends
had
attended
the
funeral
at
emily
request
no
one
accompanied
her
home
baxendale
drove
her
to
the
door
and
went
on
to
dunfield
the
last
link
with
the
past
was
severed
almost
it
seemed
the
last
link
with
the
world
a
sense
of
loneliness
grew
about
her
heart
she
lived
in
a
vast
solitude
whither
came
faintest
echoes
of
lamentation
the
dying
resonance
of
things
that
had
been
it
could
hardly
be
called
grief
this
drawing
off
of
the
affections
this
desiccation
of
the
familiar
kindnesses
which
for
the
time
seemed
all
her
being
she
forced
herself
to
remember
that
the
sap
of
life
would
flow
again
that
love
would
come
back
to
her
when
the
hand
of
death
released
her
from
its
cruel
grip
as
yet
she
could
only
be
sensible
of
her
isolation
her
forlorn
oneness
it
needs
a
long
time
before
the
heart
can
companion
only
with
memories
about
its
own
centre
it
wraps
such
warm
folds
of
kindred
life
tear
these
away
how
the
poor
heart
shivers
in
its
nakedness
she
was
alone
it
no
longer
mattered
where
she
lived
for
her
alliances
henceforth
were
only
of
the
spirit
she
must
find
some
sphere
in
which
she
could
create
for
herself
a
new
activity
for
to
sit
in
idleness
was
to
invite
dread
assaults
the
task
of
her
life
was
an
inward
one
but
her
nature
was
not
adapted
to
quiescence
and
something
must
replace
the
task
which
had
come
to
an
end
by
her
mother
death
already
she
had
shaped
plans
and
she
dared
not
allow
needless
time
to
intervene
before
practically
pursuing
them
in
the
evening
of
that
day
baxendale
again
came
to
banbrigg
she
found
emily
with
writing
materials
before
her
her
object
in
coming
was
to
urge
emily
to
quit
this
lonely
house
and
stay
with
me
she
entreated
shall
be
as
unmolested
as
here
no
one
but
myself
shall
ever
come
near
you
emily
i
can
not
go
home
and
sleep
with
the
thought
of
you
here
alone
forget
emily
replied
i
have
in
reality
lived
alone
for
a
long
time
i
do
not
feel
it
as
you
imagine
no
i
must
stay
here
but
not
for
long
i
shall
at
once
find
a
teacher
place
again
is
your
intention
i
shall
sell
the
furniture
and
ask
the
landlord
to
find
another
tenant
as
soon
as
possible
but
till
i
go
away
i
wish
to
live
in
this
house
baxendale
knew
that
emily
projects
were
not
to
be
combated
like
a
girl
idle
fancies
she
did
not
persevere
but
let
sad
silence
be
her
answer
you
in
no
case
stay
in
dunfield
i
must
leave
dunfield
i
do
think
i
shall
find
it
difficult
to
get
employment
baxendale
had
never
ventured
to
ask
for
the
girl
confidence
nor
even
to
show
that
she
desired
it
emily
was
more
perplexing
to
her
now
than
even
at
the
time
of
wilfrid
athel
rejection
she
consoled
herself
with
the
thought
that
a
period
of
active
occupation
was
no
doubt
the
best
means
of
restoring
this
complex
nature
to
healthy
views
of
life
that
at
all
events
it
was
likely
to
bring
about
an
unravelling
of
the
mysteries
in
which
her
existence
seemed
to
have
become
involved
you
could
not
deal
with
her
as
with
other
girls
the
sources
of
her
strength
and
her
weakness
lay
too
deep
counsel
to
her
would
be
a
useless
an
impertinent
interference
with
her
grave
baxendale
could
but
speak
words
of
extreme
tenderness
and
return
whence
she
had
come
on
going
away
she
felt
that
the
darkest
spot
of
night
was
over
that
house
emily
lived
at
banbrigg
for
more
than
three
weeks
after
the
first
few
days
she
appeared
to
grow
lighter
in
mind
she
talked
more
freely
with
those
who
came
to
see
her
and
gladly
accepted
friendly
aid
in
little
practical
matters
which
had
to
be
seen
to
between
banbrigg
and
dunfield
lay
the
cemetery
there
she
passed
a
part
of
every
morning
sometimes
in
grief
which
opened
all
the
old
wounds
more
often
in
concentration
of
thought
such
as
made
her
unaware
of
the
passage
of
time
the
winter
weather
was
not
severe
not
seldom
a
thin
gleam
of
sunshine
would
pass
from
grave
to
grave
and
give
promise
of
spring
in
the
said
reign
of
the
year
first
month
emily
was
almost
the
only
visitor
at
the
hour
she
chose
she
had
given
directions
for
the
raising
of
a
stone
at
the
as
yet
there
was
only
the
hillock
close
at
hand
was
a
grave
on
which
friends
placed
flowers
sheltering
them
beneath
glass
emily
had
no
desire
to
express
her
mourning
in
that
way
the
flower
of
her
love
was
planted
where
it
would
not
die
but
she
longed
to
bring
her
time
of
waiting
to
an
end
the
steps
she
had
as
yet
taken
had
led
to
nothing
she
had
not
requested
baxendale
to
make
inquiries
for
her
and
her
friend
thinking
she
understood
the
reason
did
not
volunteer
assistance
nor
did
she
hear
any
particulars
of
the
correspondence
that
went
on
ultimately
emily
communicated
with
her
acquaintances
in
liverpool
who
were
at
once
anxious
to
serve
her
she
told
them
that
she
would
by
preference
find
a
place
in
a
school
and
at
length
they
drew
her
attention
to
an
advertisement
which
seemed
promising
it
was
for
a
teacher
in
a
girls
school
near
liverpool
a
brief
correspondence
led
to
her
being
engaged
she
was
in
perfect
readiness
to
depart
for
a
day
or
two
she
had
not
seen
baxendale
and
on
the
afternoon
before
the
day
of
her
leaving
banbrigg
she
went
to
take
leave
of
her
friends
it
was
her
intention
to
visit
baxendale
first
then
to
go
on
to
the
cartwrights
as
it
rained
she
walked
to
pendal
and
took
train
for
dunfield
at
dunfield
station
she
was
delayed
for
some
moments
in
leaving
the
carriage
by
travellers
who
got
out
before
her
with
complexities
of
baggage
to
reach
the
exit
of
the
station
she
had
to
cross
the
line
by
a
bridge
and
at
the
foot
of
this
bridge
stood
the
porter
who
collected
tickets
as
she
drew
near
to
him
her
eyes
fell
upon
a
figure
moving
before
her
that
of
a
young
man
wearing
thick
travelling
apparel
and
carrying
a
bag
she
did
not
need
to
see
his
face
yet
as
he
stopped
to
give
up
his
ticket
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
it
the
train
by
which
she
had
travelled
had
also
brought
wilfrid
to
dunfield
she
turned
and
walked
to
a
little
distance
away
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
there
was
no
room
that
she
could
enter
on
this
platform
she
dropped
her
black
veil
and
seated
herself
on
a
bench
in
truth
she
had
a
difficulty
in
standing
her
body
trembled
so
for
five
minutes
she
remained
seated
calming
herself
and
determining
what
course
to
take
she
held
it
for
certain
that
wilfrid
had
come
at
baxendale
bidding
but
would
he
go
to
that
house
first
or
straight
to
her
own
with
the
latter
purpose
he
would
probably
have
left
the
train
at
pendal
she
would
have
time
to
get
home
before
he
could
come
at
this
moment
a
train
was
entering
the
station
on
the
other
side
she
hurried
over
the
bridge
and
without
stopping
to
obtain
a
ticket
entered
a
carriage
it
was
not
without
dread
lest
wilfrid
might
have
already
arrived
and
be
waiting
within
for
her
return
that
she
approached
the
house
door
her
fears
were
groundless
the
servant
told
her
that
no
one
had
called
anyone
should
call
this
evening
she
said
can
not
see
them
you
will
say
that
i
shall
not
be
able
to
see
anyone
anyone
whoever
it
is
till
at
this
same
hour
baxendale
entering
a
shop
in
dunfield
found
dagworthy
making
purchases
shall
not
see
you
again
for
a
long
time
he
said
as
he
was
leaving
start
on
a
long
journey
of
england
he
did
not
specify
his
route
merely
said
that
he
was
going
far
from
england
they
shook
hands
and
baxendale
was
left
with
a
musing
expression
on
her
face
she
turned
her
eyes
to
the
counter
the
purchase
for
which
dagworthy
had
just
paid
was
a
box
of
ladies
gloves
the
shopman
put
them
aside
to
be
made
into
a
parcel
and
sent
away
when
half
an
hour
later
she
reached
home
she
was
at
once
informed
that
athel
was
in
the
the
intelligence
caused
her
to
bite
her
lower
lip
a
way
she
had
of
expressing
the
milder
form
of
vexation
she
went
first
to
remove
her
walking
apparel
and
did
not
hasten
the
process
when
she
at
length
entered
the
wilfrid
was
pacing
about
in
his
accustomed
fashion
here
she
exclaimed
with
a
dubious
shake
of
the
head
so
soon
soon
the
time
has
gone
more
quickly
with
you
than
with
me
mrs
baxendale
clearly
he
had
not
spent
the
last
three
months
in
ease
of
mind
his
appearance
was
too
like
that
with
which
he
had
come
from
oxford
on
the
occasion
of
his
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
continued
can
not
let
her
go
away
without
seeing
her
will
go
this
evening
i
must
you
have
nothing
hopeful
to
say
to
me
baxendale
dropped
her
eyes
and
answered
then
she
regarded
him
as
if
in
preface
to
some
utterance
of
moment
but
after
all
kept
silence
she
heard
of
anything
yet
believe
not
i
have
not
seen
her
since
tuesday
and
then
she
told
me
of
nothing
but
i
do
ask
her
know
you
explained
i
think
you
have
done
wisely
how
is
she
seemingly
he
let
his
feeling
get
the
upper
hand
ca
leave
her
again
without
an
explanation
she
tell
me
everything
have
i
not
a
right
to
ask
it
of
her
i
ca
live
on
like
this
i
do
nothing
the
days
pass
in
misery
of
idleness
if
only
in
pity
she
will
tell
me
all
you
think
it
possible
baxendale
asked
she
has
already
done
so
he
gazed
at
her
blankly
despairingly
have
come
to
believe
that
her
words
her
manner
seem
to
prove
that
can
not
say
certainly
i
only
mean
that
you
should
be
prepared
to
believe
if
she
repeated
it
if
she
repeats
it
i
shall
have
no
choice
well
i
wished
to
see
you
first
i
will
go
to
banbrigg
at
once
baxendale
seemed
reluctant
to
let
him
go
yet
at
length
she
did
he
was
absent
an
hour
and
a
half
at
his
return
baxendale
had
friends
with
her
in
the
drawing
room
wilfrid
ascertained
it
from
the
servant
and
said
that
he
would
go
to
the
he
had
formerly
occupied
and
wait
there
till
the
lady
was
alone
she
came
to
him
before
very
long
and
learnt
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
see
emily
the
servant
had
told
him
that
she
could
see
no
one
till
the
next
morning
baxendale
sighed
you
must
wait
i
must
wait
he
passed
the
night
at
the
house
baxendale
was
in
london
parliamentarily
occupied
at
eleven
next
morning
he
went
again
to
banbrigg
again
he
was
but
a
short
time
absent
and
in
his
face
as
he
entered
the
baxendale
read
catastrophe
has
gone
he
said
left
very
early
this
morning
the
girl
has
no
idea
where
she
has
gone
to
but
says
she
wo
return
that
she
has
left
for
good
what
does
this
mean
does
it
mean
the
lady
repeated
musingly
wonder
i
wonder
knew
i
called
yesterday
i
left
my
name
she
has
gone
to
avoid
me
may
be
but
all
her
preparations
were
evidently
made
it
may
not
be
true
the
girl
of
course
would
say
whatever
she
was
bidden
to
i
do
believe
that
she
has
really
gone
do
said
baxendale
with
quiet
significance
what
grounds
you
know
more
than
you
will
tell
me
is
there
no
one
with
common
humanity
why
do
you
plot
against
me
why
wo
you
tell
me
what
you
know
will
if
you
sit
down
there
and
endeavour
to
command
yourself
that
is
i
will
tell
you
certain
things
that
i
have
heard
and
something
that
i
have
seen
then
we
will
reason
about
them
wilfrid
brow
darkened
he
prepared
to
listen
six
weeks
ago
the
lady
began
went
to
see
a
friend
of
mine
a
lady
who
was
recovering
from
an
illness
someone
who
knows
emily
though
not
intimately
in
her
illness
she
was
nursed
by
the
same
woman
who
helped
poor
mrs
hood
when
emily
was
in
her
fever
this
woman
it
appears
was
induced
to
talk
about
emily
and
gave
it
as
a
secret
that
emily
illness
had
something
to
do
with
an
attachment
between
her
and
dagworthy
her
father
employer
her
grounds
for
believing
this
were
first
of
all
the
fact
of
emily
frequently
uttering
his
name
in
her
delirium
with
words
which
seemed
to
refer
to
some
mystery
between
them
then
the
circumstance
of
dagworthy
having
shortly
after
left
a
note
at
the
house
with
special
injunctions
to
the
servant
that
it
should
be
given
into
emily
own
hands
this
story
you
may
imagine
surprised
me
not
a
little
a
few
days
later
dagworthy
dined
with
us
and
i
took
an
opportunity
of
talking
with
him
it
seemed
to
me
certain
that
emily
had
some
special
place
in
his
thoughts
i
know
too
that
he
was
particularly
anxious
throughout
the
time
of
her
illness
and
that
of
her
mother
the
listener
was
paralysed
have
you
kept
this
from
me
he
asked
indignation
blending
with
his
misery
it
was
no
better
than
gossip
and
speculation
i
had
no
right
to
report
such
things
at
all
events
so
it
seemed
to
me
now
i
am
going
to
add
something
which
may
be
the
wildest
error
but
which
can
not
trouble
you
much
if
you
imagine
that
the
story
is
true
yesterday
just
before
i
came
home
to
find
you
here
i
met
dagworthy
by
chance
in
a
shop
and
he
told
me
that
he
was
going
away
leaving
england
and
i
saw
that
he
had
been
buying
a
box
of
ladies
gloves
do
you
mean
wilfrid
stammered
out
know
that
he
has
no
female
relatives
except
his
wife
who
live
in
another
part
of
england
and
are
on
bad
terms
with
him
you
said
late
wife
he
is
a
widower
now
we
may
be
imagining
in
the
silliest
way
but
why
wilfrid
checked
himself
i
understand
you
you
think
emily
has
gone
with
him
has
gone
to
be
married
to
him
is
almost
impossible
seriously
to
think
it
you
think
she
would
shrink
from
being
married
here
one
or
two
reasons
at
all
events
so
soon
is
it
possible
to
believe
that
she
deliberately
deceived
you
made
a
pretence
of
seeking
employment
ca
say
she
never
gave
me
any
details
of
what
she
was
doing
another
thing
she
would
not
come
to
stay
with
me
after
her
funeral
dagworthy
lives
on
the
heath
only
just
beyond
banbrigg
you
see
to
what
things
we
can
be
led
if
we
begin
interpreting
shadows
but
emily
is
a
mystery
to
me
and
as
i
have
begun
i
must
gossip
to
you
all
i
know
baxendale
was
certainly
doing
more
in
the
way
of
gossiping
conjecture
than
perhaps
she
had
ever
done
before
the
occasion
excited
her
and
that
coincidence
of
dagworthy
purchase
together
with
his
departure
this
very
day
struck
her
with
a
force
which
unsettled
her
usual
balance
of
thought
wilfrid
was
as
ready
to
believe
to
him
there
was
a
certain
strange
relief
in
feeling
that
he
had
at
length
reached
the
climax
of
his
sufferings
he
had
only
to
give
credence
to
own
words
she
had
said
that
a
change
had
come
in
her
heart
in
her
life
and
that
she
no
longer
loved
him
understand
it
he
of
course
could
not
nor
ever
would
unless
he
lost
all
faith
in
woman
honour
this
can
be
either
confirmed
or
refuted
speedily
he
exclaimed
you
not
make
inquiries
of
this
dagworthy
friends
if
they
know
nothing
yet
they
will
soon
hear
from
him
i
can
make
such
inquiries
but
he
has
a
peculiar
reputation
in
dunfield
i
think
he
scarcely
has
an
intimate
friend
there
is
at
all
events
emily
herself
if
this
story
is
baseless
she
will
be
writing
to
you
think
so
again
we
must
wait
poor
wilfrid
from
my
heart
i
feel
for
you
it
was
decided
that
wilfrid
should
remain
in
dunfield
for
a
day
or
two
till
news
might
be
obtained
news
came
however
sooner
than
was
anticipated
in
the
afternoon
a
letter
was
delivered
posted
by
emily
at
pendal
in
the
morning
she
wrote
to
baxendale
to
say
that
she
had
left
to
take
a
place
in
a
school
then
continued
have
a
reason
for
leaving
suddenly
a
reason
you
will
understand
i
should
have
come
to
say
to
you
yesterday
but
something
happened
to
prevent
me
the
same
reason
has
decided
me
to
keep
secret
even
from
you
my
dear
and
honoured
friend
the
place
to
which
i
am
going
in
time
you
shall
hear
from
me
for
i
know
i
can
not
have
forfeited
your
love
though
i
fear
i
have
given
you
pain
think
of
me
with
forbearance
i
do
what
i
do
that
was
all
no
word
for
wilfrid
proves
it
wilfrid
said
with
bitter
coldness
she
says
is
false
she
does
what
she
is
ashamed
of
and
lies
to
conceal
it
for
a
few
days
or
weeks
not
let
us
even
yet
be
sure
said
baxendale
who
was
recovering
her
calmer
judgment
sure
why
should
she
keep
the
place
secret
she
fears
that
i
should
follow
her
could
she
not
anywhere
keep
me
off
by
her
mere
bidding
have
i
been
brutally
importunate
what
secret
can
exist
that
she
might
not
disclose
to
me
that
she
was
not
bound
to
disclose
i
thought
her
incapable
of
a
breath
of
falsehood
and
she
must
have
deceived
me
from
the
first
from
the
very
first
that
is
impossible
i
can
not
abandon
my
faith
in
emily
new
you
speak
in
this
way
it
convinces
me
that
we
are
wrong
utterly
and
foolishly
mistaken
i
believe
what
she
says
here
she
has
gone
with
him
wilfrid
laughed
scornfully
is
too
late
i
ca
twist
my
belief
so
quickly
i
do
not
need
that
kind
of
comfort
far
easier
to
make
up
my
mind
that
i
have
always
been
fooled
as
i
have
he
was
beyond
the
stage
at
which
reasoning
is
possible
reaction
in
full
flood
beat
down
the
nobler
features
of
his
mind
and
swamped
him
with
the
raging
waters
of
resentment
so
here
was
a
myth
well
on
its
way
to
establishment
for
no
one
could
afford
baxendale
satisfactory
news
of
dagworthy
she
would
not
take
the
only
step
which
remained
that
of
openly
avowing
to
his
partner
the
information
she
desired
to
obtain
and
getting
him
to
make
inquiries
his
partner
appeared
to
be
the
only
person
in
direct
communication
with
dagworthy
it
had
to
be
remembered
that
emily
own
statement
might
be
true
she
must
not
be
spoken
of
lightly
it
was
said
that
legge
the
partner
the
idea
that
dagworthy
was
secretly
married
but
legge
might
know
as
little
as
other
people
there
were
circles
in
dunfield
in
which
another
and
quite
a
different
myth
grew
up
around
the
name
of
emily
hood
the
cartwrights
originated
it
they
too
had
received
a
mysterious
note
of
farewell
and
their
interpretation
was
this
emily
they
held
had
gone
to
london
there
to
be
happily
married
to
a
certain
athel
a
gentleman
of
aristocratic
appearance
and
enormously
wealthy
baxendale
heard
this
story
now
and
again
she
neither
affirmed
nor
contradicted
jessie
cartwright
reflected
much
on
emily
slyness
in
keeping
her
affairs
so
secret
she
was
not
as
envious
as
she
would
have
been
but
for
a
certain
compact
which
she
was
determined
should
not
if
it
lay
in
her
power
to
prevent
it
be
some
day
laughed
away
as
a
mere
joke
and
had
she
not
received
on
the
very
eve
of
dagworthy
departure
a
box
of
gloves
which
could
only
come
from
one
person
the
second
myth
holds
its
ground
i
believe
to
the
present
day
the
more
mischievous
fable
was
refuted
before
very
long
but
only
when
it
had
borne
results
for
wilfrid
practically
the
same
as
if
it
had
been
a
truth

the
culmination

sustained
utterance
there
last
night
the
young
member
for
a
surrey
borough
made
his
maiden
speech
his
name
wilfrid
athel
the
speech
was
better
reported
than
such
are
wont
to
be
for
it
contained
clever
things
and
quite
surprisingly
resembled
in
its
tone
of
easy
confidence
and
its
mastery
of
relevant
facts
the
deliverances
of
men
of
weight
in
politics
it
had
elicited
a
compliment
from
a
leader
of
the
opposing
party
it
had
occasioned
raisings
of
the
eyebrows
in
capable
judges
and
had
led
to
remarks
that
a
young
man
so
singularly
so
agreeably
oracular
so
remarkably
might
be
expected
in
the
course
of
some
years
to
go
far
he
was
to
be
sure
a
child
not
yet
thirty
but
there
were
older
children
in
the
house
decidedly
of
less
promise
wilfrid
athel
might
go
home
and
if
he
could
go
to
sleep
in
the
assurance
that
his
career
had
opened
the
next
day
a
saturday
this
finished
little
piece
of
talk
was
the
of
a
vast
amount
of
less
coherent
speech
in
a
within

of
kensington
verdure
here
ashley
birks
did
her
friends
the
honour
of
receiving
them
a
lady
well
regarded
in
certain
discriminating
circles
a
widow
formerly
she
had
now
been
two
years
married
to
a
barrister
new
in
silk
we
have
the
pleasure
of
knowing
her
for
she
once
bore
the
name
of
rossall
at
five
ashley
birks
contained
some
two
dozen
people
mostly
ladies
two
of
the
gentlemen
present
are
not
without
interest
for
us
he
whom
you
observe
standing
so
to
speak
the
focus
of
a
concave
mirror
of
three
gracious
dames
with
his
back
somewhat
difficultly
bent
as
if
under
ordinary
circumstances
he
would
be
as
upright
as
any
briton
who
owes
not
a
penny
with
very
wholesome
cheeks
and
lips
which
move
in
and
out
as
he
forms
his
periods
is
of
course
athel
the
elder
he
plays
with
his
and
is
clearly
in
hearty
mood
not
at
all
disliking
the
things
that
are
being
said
about
a
certain
member
of
the
legislature
the
other
is
as
emphatically
an
englishman
but
of
a
different
type
his
clothes
are
good
but
he
does
not
wear
them
with
grace
he
is
tall
and
solidly
built
but
he
walks
awkwardly
and
is
not
quite
at
home
among
these
gracious
ladies
of
the
silvern
tongue
having
much
difficulty
in
expressing
himself
on
subjects
which
he
perfectly
understands
and
absolutely
without
faculty
for
speech
on
subjects
unfamiliar
to
him
when
we
saw
him
last
he
was
in
the
heat
of
a
contested
election
there
has
been
another
election
since
then
but
baxendale
still
represents
dunfield
you
see
his
wife
at
a
little
distance
still
the
same
lady
with
goodness
declaring
itself
upon
her
large
and
homely
features
for
three
years
now
she
has
been
in
the
habit
of
spending
her
three
months
in
town
finding
it
lonely
in
dunfield
and
even
nourishing
a
late
ambition
which
has
not
been
altogether
futile
for
there
re
people
who
have
a
peculiar
liking
for
the
little
room
in
which
she
holds
her
modest
gatherings
she
is
talking
at
present
with
a
lady
who
by
her
costume
is
of
the
house
a
lady
of
some
years
or
a
little
more
and
strikingly
beautiful
beatrice
redwing
has
not
yet
changed
her
name
though
often
enough
solicited
to
do
so
when
her
mother
died
now
rather
more
than
a
year
ago
she
willingly
accepted
the
shelter
of
ashley
birks
roof
as
she
would
else
have
had
to
live
alone
in
one
respect
she
has
not
changed
her
dress
is
exquisite
but
to
judge
from
her
expression
as
she
talks
she
has
become
somewhat
graver
visitors
have
a
special
reason
for
regarding
her
with
glances
of
curiosity
and
admiration
though
known
to
be
extremely
wealthy
it
was
rumoured
that
she
was
about
to
appear
before
the
public
as
a
vocalist
having
prepared
herself
by
a
long
course
of
the
most
rigid
study
her
first
appearance
was
looked
forward
to
as
an
event
of
note
in
the
musical
world
for
her
native
gifts
were
unusual
and
the
results
of
her
training
proportionately
significant
must
be
very
gratifying
to
you
baxendale
had
said
as
she
came
to
a
chair
by
her
niece
and
began
to
talk
of
wilfrid
success
i
am
glad
of
it
was
the
quiet
reply
he
be
here
this
afternoon
not
sure
i
think
so
ah
there
he
is
for
at
that
moment
had
come
the
announcement
of
the
name
they
had
on
their
lips
beatrice
exclamation
was
made
in
a
very
subdued
voice
but
she
moved
slightly
in
her
chair
and
it
was
not
within
her
resources
to
subdue
the
glister
of
her
dark
eyes
and
the
warmth
softly
expanding
upon
her
cheek
birks
floated
towards
her
nephew
with
airs
of
welcome
she
could
not
of
course
make
much
of
him
but
her
very
familiarity
made
graceful
claim
to
a
share
in
his
glory
wilfrid
was
sensibly
changed
during
the
years
we
have
allowed
to
pass
silently
by
to
begin
with
he
had
grown
a
beard
his
health
seemed
finally
to
have
established
itself
on
a
sound
basis
his
cheeks
were
growing
sunny
and
he
showed
the
proportions
of
a
very
complete
man
at
the
present
moment
his
consciousness
of
regards
fixed
upon
him
heightened
his
colour
his
fine
eyes
danced
in
light
he
checked
a
smile
and
spoke
sparingly
here
and
there
one
part
of
his
nature
revelled
in
the
joy
of
this
foretaste
of
distinction
he
had
looked
forward
to
it
had
laboured
for
it
its
sweetness
was
beyond
all
telling
triumph
had
been
his
aim
as
a
schoolboy
he
held
it
fitting
that
as
a
man
he
should
become
prominent
amongst
his
fellows
this
of
politics
was
the
easiest
way
to
be
sure
he
told
himself
that
it
was
a
way
he
would
once
have
sneered
at
that
it
was
to
rub
shoulders
with
men
altogether
his
inferiors
in
culture
that
had
he
held
to
the
ideals
of
his
youth
a
longer
a
wearier
course
would
have
been
his
and
the
chance
of
a
simpler
nobler
crown
but
he
had
the
gift
of
speech
and
by
an
effort
could
absorb
himself
as
completely
in
as
in
the
pages
of
historian
or
poet
an
hour
such
as
this
was
the
first
of
his
rewards
two
there
were
in
this
assembly
who
turned
their
eyes
upon
him
with
adoration
which
could
scarcely
have
fallen
short
of
wilfrid
utmost
demands
they
were
his
cousins
minnie
and
patty
rossall
the
twins
were
very
sweet
girls
still
too
delicate
in
health
shadows
of
each
other
had
they
regarded
wilfrid
as
a
mere
mortal
both
would
have
been
dying
for
love
of
him
as
it
was
they
drooped
before
him
the
veiled
eyes
of
worshippers
a
word
from
him
made
their
pulses
tingle
blissfully
throughout
the
day
such
was
their
mutual
love
that
each
schemed
to
win
his
kindness
for
the
other
his
brotherly
kindness
for
they
never
thought
had
never
dared
to
think
of
anything
else
wilfrid
was
very
gracious
to
them
both
he
shook
hands
with
beatrice
but
neither
spoke
after
a
few
words
with
baxendale
he
passed
on
to
other
ladies
wilfrid
manner
was
now
all
that
could
be
desired
in
a
young
man
who
destined
to
succeed
in
politics
would
naturally
make
a
figure
in
society
he
was
pliant
he
struck
the
note
of
he
was
unsurpassed
in
phrasing
with
ladies
who
chose
to
be
he
could
find
exactly
the
right
tone
keeping
clear
of
pedantry
yet
paying
her
with
whom
he
spoke
the
compliment
of
uttering
serious
opinions
with
the
more
numerous
class
of
ladies
who
neither
were
nor
affected
to
be
anything
but
delightful
chatterboxes
he
could
frolic
on
the
lightest
airs
of
society
gossip
he
was
fast
making
of
himself
an
artist
in
talk
woe
to
him
if
he
began
to
discover
that
exertion
of
his
brain
was
waste
of
time
since
his
more
obvious
ends
could
be
gained
equally
well
without
it
as
yet
though
hints
of
such
a
mood
had
come
to
him
he
did
not
give
way
to
the
temptations
of
loquacious
idleness
he
still
worked
and
purposed
to
work
still
harder
just
of
late
he
had
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
in
rooms
not
exactly
arranged
for
purposes
of
study
but
for
this
there
was
a
special
reason
an
hour
later
when
most
of
the
visitors
were
departed
he
went
to
beatrice
corner
of
the
room
shall
i
call
for
you
he
asked
standing
before
her
but
you
will
dine
here
she
leaned
forward
looking
up
into
his
face
the
gaze
would
have
intoxicated
most
men
wilfrid
kept
his
calm
smile
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
ca
was
his
reply
have
things
to
see
to
at
home
will
do
well
i
need
not
be
at
the
hall
before
a
quarter
to
nine
his
father
came
up
my
way
wilf
and
in
a
hurry
i
think
we
must
have
a
hansom
father
and
son
still
lived
together
in
the
same
house
as
formerly
after
a
brief
stretch
of
pavement
they
hailed
a
conveyance
to
james
hall
i
suppose
athel
asked
as
they
drove
on
wilfrid
gave
an
affirmative
it
the
last
time
the
other
laughed
ca
say
i
fear
it
troubles
you
athel
had
we
know
long
passed
the
time
when
the
ardours
of
youth
put
him
above
the
prejudices
of
the
solid
englishman
when
it
was
first
announced
to
him
that
beatrice
was
going
to
sing
on
a
public
platform
he
screwed
up
his
lips
as
if
something
acid
had
fallen
upon
them
he
scarcely
credited
the
story
till
his
own
eyes
saw
the
girl
name
in
print
the
deuce
was
his
exclamation
would
be
all
very
well
if
she
had
to
do
it
for
her
living
but
she
certainly
owes
it
to
her
friends
to
preserve
the
decencies
as
long
as
there
is
no
need
to
violate
them
the
reasons
advanced
he
utterly
refused
to
weigh
since
then
events
had
come
to
pass
which
gave
him
even
a
nearer
interest
in
miss
redwing
and
his
protests
had
grown
serious
yes
he
answered
now
does
trouble
me
and
not
a
little
i
very
strongly
advise
you
to
put
an
end
to
it
let
her
sing
in
her
friends
houses
there
no
objection
to
that
but
to
have
her
name
on
great
heavens
on
placards
no
no
it
must
stop
wilf
every
day
it
becomes
more
imperative
your
position
demands
that
she
should
become
a
private
lady
wilfrid
knew
well
that
the
question
could
not
be
argued
and
in
his
secret
mind
there
was
just
a
little
tendency
to
take
his
father
view
he
would
never
have
allowed
this
shade
of
thought
to
appear
in
his
speech
but
was
he
not
an
englishman
and
a
member
of
parliament
this
which
had
come
about
was
inevitable
after
his
departure
from
dunfield
on
that
winter
day
when
his
life
seemed
crushed
he
had
for
a
long
time
not
even
sought
to
hear
of
emily
he
did
not
write
to
baxendale
and
from
her
had
no
letters
correspondence
between
them
only
recommenced
some
ten
months
later
when
wilfrid
had
finally
left
oxford
and
then
there
was
no
mention
on
either
side
of
the
old
troubles
wilfrid
began
by
writing
that
he
had
thoughts
of
taking
up
politics
his
father
advised
him
to
the
step
and
other
friends
seconded
the
recommendation
really
believe
i
can
talk
he
said
and
baxendale
smiled
at
the
confession
three
months
more
went
by
then
wilfrid
at
length
asked
plainly
whether
emily
had
sent
any
news
of
herself
or
whether
the
suspicions
had
proved
grounded
the
reply
was
this
i
knew
perfectly
well
as
soon
as
i
came
to
my
senses
emily
had
told
us
the
truth
i
heard
from
her
for
the
first
time
nearly
half
a
year
ago
but
as
she
appealed
to
my
honour
not
to
disclose
the
place
of
her
abode
i
thought
it
needless
to
speak
to
you
on
the
subject
before
you
yourself
seemed
desirous
of
hearing
she
is
teaching
in
a
school
and
i
am
convinced
that
the
story
we
together
concocted
was
based
on
some
utter
mistake
i
do
think
she
was
ever
related
to
that
man
in
the
way
we
thought
but
it
is
more
than
probable
that
there
was
some
mystery
about
her
father
death
in
which
was
concerned
i
can
not
imagine
what
it
could
be
something
it
was
which
to
mind
imposed
upon
her
a
necessity
of
breaking
her
engagement
i
have
spoken
to
her
of
you
have
asked
her
directly
if
she
still
thinks
her
decision
final
she
assures
me
most
solemnly
that
it
is
i
therefore
advise
you
once
for
all
to
accept
this
i
am
convinced
she
will
never
waver
try
to
forget
her
there
is
no
choice
i
do
think
i
am
likely
to
see
her
again
for
a
very
long
time
if
ever
and
our
correspondence
will
be
very
slight
for
i
know
she
wishes
it
so
let
this
then
close
a
sad
sad
story
there
was
indeed
no
choice
as
far
as
outward
relations
went
but
so
profound
a
passion
was
not
to
be
easily
outgrown
the
view
which
makes
first
love
alone
eternally
valid
derives
from
a
conception
of
the
nature
of
love
which
out
of
the
realm
of
poetry
we
may
not
entertain
but
it
sometimes
happens
that
the
first
love
is
that
which
would
at
any
period
of
life
have
been
the
supreme
one
and
then
it
doubtless
attains
a
special
intensity
of
hold
from
the
fact
of
its
being
allied
with
the
earliest
outburst
of
physical
passion
above
all
it
is
thus
if
the
attachment
has
been
brought
about
by
other
charms
than
those
of
mere
personal
beauty
emily
could
not
be
called
beautiful
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
word
for
all
that
her
face
grew
to
possess
for
wilfrid
a
perfection
of
loveliness
beyond
anything
that
he
would
ever
again
see
in
the
countenance
of
fairest
woman
had
he
been
markedly
susceptible
to
female
beauty
it
is
certain
that
he
would
have
fallen
in
love
with
beatrice
redwing
long
before
he
ever
saw
emily
for
beatrice
was
fair
to
look
upon
as
few
girls
are
he
had
not
done
so
he
had
scarcely
a
strange
thing
been
tempted
to
think
of
doing
so
that
is
to
say
it
needed
something
more
to
fire
his
instincts
the
first
five
minutes
that
he
spent
in
emily
presence
made
him
more
conscious
of
womanhood
than
years
of
constant
association
with
beatrice
this
love
riveting
itself
among
the
intricacies
of
his
being
could
not
be
torn
out
and
threatened
to
resist
all
piecemeal
extraction
wilfrid
regained
the
command
of
his
mind
and
outwardly
seemed
recovered
beyond
all
danger
of
relapse
but
he
did
not
deceive
himself
into
believing
that
emily
was
henceforth
indifferent
to
him
he
knew
that
to
stand
again
before
her
would
be
to
declare
again
his
utter
bondage
body
and
soul
he
loved
her
still
loved
her
as
his
life
he
desired
her
as
passionately
as
ever
she
was
not
often
in
his
thoughts
no
more
is
the
consciousness
of
the
processes
whereby
our
being
supports
itself
but
he
had
only
to
let
his
mind
turn
to
her
and
he
scoffed
at
the
hope
that
any
other
could
ever
be
to
him
what
emily
had
been
and
was
and
would
be
he
saw
very
little
of
beatrice
but
it
came
to
his
ears
that
her
life
had
undergone
a
change
in
several
respects
that
she
spent
hours
daily
in
strenuous
study
of
music
and
was
less
seen
in
the
frivolous
world
no
hint
of
the
purpose
beatrice
secretly
entertained
ever
reached
him
till
long
after
the
purpose
became
action
he
felt
that
she
shunned
him
and
by
degrees
he
thought
he
understood
her
behaviour
wilfrid
had
none
of
the
vulgarest
vanity
another
man
would
long
ago
have
suspected
that
this
beautiful
girl
was
in
love
with
him
wilfrid
had
remained
absolutely
without
a
suspicion
of
the
kind
he
had
always
taken
in
good
faith
her
declared
aversion
for
his
views
he
had
believed
that
her
nature
and
his
own
were
definitely
irreconcilable
this
was
attributable
first
of
all
to
his
actual
inexperience
in
life
then
to
the
seriousness
with
which
he
held
those
views
which
beatrice
vowed
detestable
he
too
was
an
idealist
and
in
many
respects
destined
to
remain
so
throughout
his
life
for
he
would
never
become
on
the
one
hand
the
coldly
critical
man
who
dissects
motives
his
own
and
those
of
others
to
the
last
fibre
nor
yet
the
superficial
cynic
who
professes
and
that
he
can
explain
the
universe
by
means
of
a
few
maxims
of
cheap
pessimism
so
he
took
and
continued
to
take
utterances
without
any
grain
of
scepticism
and
consequently
held
it
for
certain
that
she
grew
less
friendly
to
him
as
she
grew
older
was
it
baxendale
or
birks
who
at
length
gave
him
the
hint
which
set
his
mind
at
work
in
another
direction
possibly
both
about
the
same
time
seeing
that
it
was
the
occasion
of
baxendale
first
making
acquaintance
with
his
aunt
that
dated
the
beginning
of
new
reflections
in
wilfrid
one
or
other
of
these
ladies
of
course
it
was
managed
so
delicately
that
he
really
could
not
have
determined
to
which
of
them
he
owed
the
impulse
succeeded
in
suggesting
to
him
that
he
had
missed
certain
obvious
meanings
in
beatrice
behaviour
whilst
he
resided
with
her
at
dunfield
certainly
when
he
looked
back
at
those
days
from
his
present
standpoint
beatrice
did
appear
to
have
conducted
herself
singularly
the
mode
of
her
departure
and
being
above
all
curious
was
it
possible
that
the
question
formed
itself
at
last
and
was
the
beginning
of
conviction
he
sought
beatrice
society
at
first
merely
for
the
sake
of
resolving
his
doubts
and
behold
she
no
longer
shrank
from
him
as
formerly
of
course
he
might
take
it
for
granted
that
she
knew
the
details
of
his
story
seeing
that
her
closest
intimates
baxendale
and
birks
were
ignorant
of
none
of
them
had
she
then
waited
for
signs
of
his
freedom
did
his
revival
of
the
old
tone
in
their
conversations
strike
her
as
something
meant
to
be
significant
meant
to
convey
to
her
certain
suggestions
it
was
so
in
point
of
fact
and
wilfrid
could
not
be
long
his
eyes
now
open
without
convincing
himself
that
the
girl
loved
him
ardently
that
it
cost
her
struggles
with
herself
to
avoid
a
revelation
of
her
feeling
how
did
it
affect
him
naturally
he
was
flattered
it
afforded
another
instance
of
his
lordship
among
men
a
woman
whom
others
longed
for
desperately
and
in
vain
was
his
when
he
chose
to
extend
his
hand
to
her
he
saw
too
an
appropriateness
in
the
chance
which
offered
him
such
a
wife
beatrice
was
in
harmony
with
the
future
to
which
he
aspired
her
property
joined
to
his
would
make
him
so
wealthy
that
he
might
aim
almost
at
anything
political
and
social
progress
would
aid
each
other
both
rapid
beatrice
was
in
many
respects
brilliant
there
was
no
station
that
she
would
not
become
she
had
the
tastes
and
habits
of
society
he
compared
her
with
his
career
she
represented
worldly
success
the
things
which
glitter
on
the
outside
action
voice
even
her
magnificent
powers
of
song
he
used
as
parallel
the
gods
forgive
him
to
his
own
forensic
abilities
supposing
he
must
marry
early
and
not
rather
expect
the
day
when
he
might
bid
for
a
partner
from
a
rank
considerably
above
his
own
beatrice
was
clearly
the
one
wife
for
him
she
would
devote
herself
with
ardour
to
his
worldly
interests
for
he
began
to
understand
that
the
divergence
of
her
expressed
views
meant
little
in
comparison
with
her
heart
worship
and
would
enable
him
immediately
to
exchange
the
social
inferiority
of
bachelor
life
for
the
standing
of
a
man
with
his
own
very
substantial
she
would
have
her
which
might
be
made
a
where
politics
and
art
might
rule
alternately
this
was
doing
injustice
to
beatrice
and
wilfrid
felt
it
but
it
was
thus
he
regarded
her
as
in
distinction
from
the
woman
who
should
have
been
his
wife
she
typified
his
chosen
career
that
other
path
which
had
lain
open
to
him
the
path
of
intellectual
endeavour
of
idealism
incompatible
with
loud
talk
of
a
worship
which
knew
no
taint
of
that
for
ever
was
represented
by
the
image
of
the
woman
he
had
lost
her
memory
was
encompassed
with
holiness
he
never
heard
the
name
she
bore
without
a
thrill
of
high
emotion
the
touch
of
exalted
enthusiasm
was
written
in
starlight
those
aspects
of
her
face
which
had
answered
to
the
purest
moments
of
his
rapturous
youth
were
as
present
as
if
she
had
been
his
daily
companion
he
needed
no
picture
to
recall
her
countenance
often
he
had
longed
for
the
skill
of
an
artist
that
he
might
portray
that
grave
sweetness
that
impassioned
faith
to
be
his
soul
lost
lost
and
with
her
lost
the
uncompromising
zeal
of
his
earliest
manhood
only
too
consciously
he
had
descended
to
a
lower
level
politics
tempted
him
because
they
offered
a
field
in
which
he
could
exercise
his
most
questionable
faculty
and
earn
with
it
a
speedy
return
of
the
praise
to
which
he
was
so
susceptible
it
marks
his
position
to
state
that
when
politics
began
seriously
to
hold
his
thoughts
he
was
with
difficulty
able
to
decide
to
which
party
he
should
attach
himself
to
be
sure
if
names
could
be
taken
as
sufficient
he
was
a
liberal
a
radical
but
how
different
his
interpretation
of
such
titles
from
that
they
bore
to
men
of
affairs
respect
for
the
masses
he
had
none
interest
in
their
affairs
he
had
none
either
on
the
other
hand
the
tone
of
uninstructed
conservatism
that
is
to
say
of
the
party
so
stamped
he
altogether
despised
the
motive
which
ultimately
decided
him
to
declare
himself
a
liberal
was
purely
of
sentiment
he
remembered
what
baxendale
had
said
about
the
hardships
of
poor
hood
and
consequently
allied
himself
with
those
who
profess
to
be
the
special
friends
of
the
toiling
multitude
from
the
first
he
talked
freely
with
beatrice
of
his
projects
he
even
exaggerated
to
her
the
cynicism
with
which
he
framed
and
pursued
them
he
could
never
have
talked
in
this
way
to
emily
with
beatrice
the
tone
did
not
injure
him
in
the
least
partly
because
she
did
not
take
it
altogether
seriously
yet
more
owing
to
the
habit
of
mind
whereby
women
in
general
subordinate
principle
to
the
practical
welfare
of
the
individual
if
wilfrid
found
a
sphere
for
the
display
of
his
talents
beatrice
eared
nothing
to
dwell
upon
abstract
points
politics
were
a
recognised
profession
for
gentlemen
and
offered
brilliant
prizes
that
was
enough
she
was
pleased
on
the
whole
that
his
line
should
be
one
of
moderation
it
was
socially
advantageous
it
made
things
pleasant
with
friends
of
the
most
various
opinions
that
wilfrid
took
her
into
his
confidence
was
to
her
a
great
happiness
in
secret
she
felt
it
would
be
the
beginning
of
closer
intimacy
of
things
which
women
heaven
be
praised
esteem
of
vastly
more
importance
than
intellectual
convictions
or
the
interest
of
party
but
it
was
long
very
long
before
wilfrid
could
bring
himself
to
pass
the
line
which
separates
friendship
from
lovemaking
of
passion
his
nature
had
no
lack
but
it
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
memory
he
shrank
from
the
thought
of
using
to
another
those
words
he
had
spoken
to
emily
one
of
the
points
of
intense
secret
sympathy
between
emily
and
himself
was
this
chastity
of
temperament
constitutionally
incapable
of
vice
he
held
in
repugnance
even
that
degree
of
materialism
in
the
view
of
sexual
relations
which
is
common
to
men
who
have
grown
their
beards
not
only
had
a
coarse
word
never
passed
his
lips
he
intensely
disliked
the
frivolous
way
of
discussing
subjects
which
to
him
were
more
sacred
than
any
other
when
he
had
decided
with
himself
that
it
was
his
destiny
to
wed
beatrice
he
had
a
positive
fear
of
taking
this
step
from
which
there
would
be
no
return
before
he
could
do
so
he
must
have
utterly
broken
with
the
past
and
how
could
that
ever
be
i
he
had
not
even
moments
of
coldness
in
his
thought
of
emily
it
was
beyond
his
power
to
foresee
the
day
when
she
would
have
become
to
him
a
mere
symbol
of
something
that
was
suppose
that
some
day
when
married
he
again
met
her
in
spite
of
everything
he
did
not
believe
that
she
had
ceased
to
love
him
somewhere
she
still
kept
her
faith
martyred
by
the
incomprehensible
fate
which
had
torn
her
from
his
arms
to
meet
her
again
would
be
to
forget
every
tie
save
that
holiest
which
made
one
of
his
spirit
and
of
hers
one
day
it
was
during
the
second
season
which
baxendale
passed
in
london
he
went
to
his
friend
and
asked
her
where
emily
was
baxendale
was
too
quick
for
him
wilfrid
thought
he
had
put
his
question
unexpectedly
but
the
lady
was
ready
for
such
a
question
at
any
moment
and
she
replied
with
appearance
of
absolute
sincerity
that
she
had
no
knowledge
of
emily
place
of
abode
was
she
last
when
you
last
heard
from
her
wilfrid
asked
in
surprise
at
an
answer
so
unanticipated
baxendale
named
a
town
in
yorkshire
she
had
begun
with
a
calculated
falsehood
and
had
no
scruple
in
backing
it
up
by
others
can
it
concern
you
wilfrid
she
continued
i
confess
my
weakness
i
mentioned
your
name
in
a
letter
to
her
the
result
was
this
complete
ending
of
our
correspondence
now
will
not
even
that
satisfy
you
he
did
not
doubt
what
he
was
told
baxendale
character
for
veracity
stood
high
it
was
solely
out
of
regard
for
wilfrid
that
she
allowed
herself
to
mislead
him
for
by
this
time
it
seemed
obvious
that
beatrice
was
drawing
near
to
her
reward
and
baxendale
with
pardonable
error
took
this
last
inquiry
about
emily
for
a
piece
of
conscientiousness
which
once
satisfied
wilfrid
would
hold
on
his
course
to
a
happy
haven
has
given
him
up
was
her
now
would
suffer
no
less
than
she
has
done
tell
me
one
thing
more
wilfrid
pursued
has
become
of
that
man
dagworthy
i
can
easily
do
long
ago
he
married
a
young
lady
of
dunfield
what
did
it
mean
what
it
mean
baxendale
merely
shook
her
head
a
few
months
later
beatrice
astonished
everyone
by
her
first
appearance
as
a
public
singer
wilfrid
had
as
little
anticipated
such
a
step
as
any
other
of
beatrice
friends
what
was
about
to
happen
only
became
known
a
day
or
two
in
advance
ashley
birks
was
paralysed
with
horror
she
implored
she
reasoned
she
put
on
her
face
of
cold
anger
athel
cried
the
deuce
and
forthwith
held
a
serious
colloquy
with
his
son
wilfrid
experienced
a
certain
joy
only
tempered
with
anxiety
as
to
the
result
of
the
experiment
if
it
proved
a
success
he
felt
that
the
effect
upon
himself
would
be
to
draw
him
nearer
to
beatrice
but
it
must
be
a
great
success
he
calculated
on
imaginative
influences
as
other
men
do
on
practical
issues
beatrice
acknowledged
as
more
than
an
amateur
perchance
publicly
recognised
as
really
a
great
singer
would
impress
him
in
a
new
way
he
might
overcome
his
impartial
way
of
regarding
her
the
result
outwardly
answered
his
fullest
hopes
beatrice
had
not
idly
risked
what
would
have
been
a
deplorable
fiasco
she
had
the
encouragement
of
those
who
did
not
speak
in
vain
and
her
ambition
had
fired
itself
as
she
perceived
the
results
of
her
conscientious
labour
her
nervousness
throughout
the
day
of
the
concert
was
terrible
but
little
less
than
her
life
depended
on
the
result
and
at
the
hour
of
trial
she
was
strong
to
conquer
very
far
behind
her
as
she
stepped
out
to
that
large
audience
were
the
dilettante
successes
of
and
charitable
concerts
she
smiled
at
all
that
flow
since
then
she
had
unlearnt
so
much
and
wrought
with
such
humility
but
what
she
strove
for
was
won
she
knew
it
in
the
grasp
of
wilfrid
hand
when
he
led
her
to
her
carriage
her
veil
was
down
behind
it
she
was
sobbing
i
nothing
more
than
a
frivolous
woman
now
she
said
leaning
to
him
from
the
carriage
wilfrid
could
make
no
answer
and
she
was
whirled
away
from
him
he
went
to
her
the
next
day
and
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
beatrice
looked
him
in
the
face
long
and
steadily
then
she
asked
you
love
me
wilfrid
love
you
another
word
trembled
on
her
tongue
but
the
temptation
of
her
bliss
was
too
great
the
contained
ardour
of
long
years
had
its
way
sweeping
doubt
and
memory
before
it
your
sake
i
have
done
it
all
what
do
i
care
for
a
whole
praise
compared
with
one
word
of
recognition
from
you
you
remember
the
morning
when
you
told
me
of
my
faults
when
we
all
but
seemed
to
quarrel
ah
i
have
faults
in
abundance
still
but
have
i
not
done
one
thing
worth
doing
done
it
thoroughly
as
net
everyone
could
i
am
not
only
a
woman
of
the
world
of
society
and
fashion
do
i
not
know
how
contemptible
that
is
but
only
you
could
raise
me
above
it
he
left
her
in
a
bewildered
state
she
had
excited
impassioned
him
but
how
strange
it
all
was
after
those
other
scenes
of
love
it
seemed
so
of
the
earth
the
words
he
had
spoken
rang
over
again
in
his
ears
and
stirred
his
blood
to
shame
he
could
not
say
whether
in
truth
he
loved
her
or
not
was
it
enough
to
feel
that
he
could
cherish
her
with
much
tenderness
and
intoxicate
himself
in
gazing
on
her
perfect
face
women
are
so
different
emily
had
scarcely
spoken
when
he
made
known
to
her
his
love
could
he
ever
forget
that
face
dimly
seen
in
the
moonlight
her
words
to
the
end
had
been
few
it
was
her
eyes
that
spoke
beatrice
was
noble
and
had
a
heart
of
gold
was
there
not
heaven
in
that
ardour
of
hers
if
only
it
had
been
his
soul
desire
henceforth
it
must
be
she
loved
him
and
he
must
not
wrong
her
alas
the
old
name
the
old
name
alone
was
still
he
passed
with
her
the
afternoon
of
each
sunday
birks
house
was
a
large
one
and
beatrice
had
abundance
of
room
to
herself
thither
wilfrid
took
his
way
on
the
sunday
which
we
have
reached
the
day
following
his
triumph
already
he
was
a
little
ashamed
of
himself
he
was
experiencing
again
the
feeling
which
had
come
over
him
after
his
first
speech
to
a
political
meeting
as
he
went
home
that
night
a
demon
in
his
head
kept
crying
and
there
was
no
silencing
the
voice
he
had
talked
to
the
intelligence
of
the
mob
now
his
talk
had
been
addressed
to
the
representatives
of
the
mob
if
the
demon
did
not
cry
so
loudly
it
was
only
because
he
was
weary
of
his
thankless
task
beatrice
was
a
superb
coquette
but
only
for
the
man
she
loved
for
these
sunday
afternoons
she
attired
herself
divinely
wilfrid
had
learnt
to
expect
a
new
marvel
at
each
of
his
comings
she
wore
her
favourite
colour
a
her
rising
to
meet
him
was
that
of
a
queen
who
bath
an
honoured
guest
the
jewels
beneath
her
long
dark
lashes
were
as
radiant
as
when
first
she
heard
him
say
love
you
all
the
impulses
of
her
impetuous
character
had
centred
on
this
one
end
of
her
life
her
eccentricities
had
tamed
themselves
in
the
long
discipline
of
frustrated
desire
the
breath
of
her
body
was
love
about
her
stole
a
barely
perceptible
perfume
which
invaded
the
senses
which
wrapped
the
heart
in
luxury
wilfrid
dropped
on
one
knee
before
her
and
kissed
her
hand
are
in
a
happy
mood
beatrice
said
has
been
telling
you
the
last
flattery
have
seen
no
one
if
i
look
happy
should
i
not
she
drew
her
finger
along
the
line
of
his
eyebrow
does
your
picture
get
on
have
to
give
two
sittings
next
week
thank
goodness
they
are
the
last
why
was
it
in
time
for
the
academy
but
it
must
go
next
year
wilfrid
laughed
as
he
seated
himself
opposite
to
her
am
not
sure
after
all
that
you
are
happy
she
said
leaning
her
head
a
little
aside
as
she
gazed
at
him
you
are
thoughtful
i
suppose
you
will
be
more
and
more
thoughtful
on
his
front
engraven
deliberation
sat
and
public
care
quoted
wilfrid
with
a
little
wrying
of
the
lips
you
know
is
one
of
the
penalties
of
greatness
she
seemed
about
to
rise
but
it
was
only
to
slip
forward
and
sink
upon
her
knees
by
his
side
her
arms
embracing
him
it
was
like
the
fall
of
fair
waters
so
gracefully
impulsive
so
one
kiss
she
murmured
her
voice
like
the
dying
of
a
flute
and
she
raised
to
him
a
face
lit
from
the
inmost
sanctuary
of
love
are
as
beautiful
he
said
any
woman
of
whom
fable
ever
told
your
beauty
frightens
me
it
is
sometimes
more
than
human
as
though
the
loveliest
greek
goddess
suddenly
found
breath
and
colour
and
the
light
of
eyes
beatrice
threw
her
head
far
back
laughing
silently
he
saw
the
laughter
dance
upon
her
throat
love
my
own
she
whispered
you
love
me
i
love
you
the
words
make
my
heart
flutter
so
i
am
glad
glad
that
i
have
beauty
but
for
that
you
would
never
have
loved
me
let
me
hide
my
face
as
i
tell
you
i
used
to
ask
myself
whether
i
was
not
really
fairer
than
other
women
i
thought
i
hoped
but
you
were
so
indifferent
wilfrid
how
long
how
long
i
have
loved
you
i
was
quite
a
young
girl
when
i
loved
you
first
that
i
said
shall
be
my
husband
or
i
will
never
have
one
and
i
knew
so
little
how
to
win
your
thought
how
ashamed
it
makes
me
to
think
of
things
i
said
and
did
in
those
days
she
was
silent
leaning
her
head
against
his
shoulder
you
ever
think
of
me
as
i
was
at
dunfield
she
asked
presently
with
timid
utterance
hardly
above
her
breath
risking
what
she
had
never
yet
dared
he
answered
think
of
the
present
his
voice
was
a
little
hard
from
the
necessity
of
commanding
it
did
not
know
that
i
loved
you
then
think
of
me
pity
me
he
made
no
answer
beatrice
spoke
again
her
face
veiled
against
him
her
arms
pressing
closer
love
me
with
perfect
love
i
have
your
whole
heart
love
you
only
beatrice
with
love
as
great
as
you
ever
knew
say
that
to
me
wilfrid
say
that
she
clung
to
him
with
passion
which
was
almost
terrible
me
only
remember
that
you
are
my
life
my
soul
i
can
not
have
less
than
that
he
would
have
been
cased
in
triple
brass
if
music
such
as
this
had
not
melted
into
his
being
he
gave
her
the
assurance
she
yearned
for
and
in
giving
it
all
but
persuaded
himself
that
he
spoke
the
very
truth
the
need
of
affirming
his
belief
drew
from
him
such
words
as
he
had
the
secret
of
beatrice
sighed
in
an
anguish
of
bliss
let
me
die
now
it
is
only
for
this
that
i
have
lived
wilfrid
had
foreseen
and
dreaded
this
questioning
from
any
woman
it
was
sooner
or
later
to
be
expected
and
beatrice
was
as
exacting
as
she
was
passionate
she
knew
herself
and
strove
hard
to
subdue
these
characteristics
which
might
be
displeasing
to
wilfrid
her
years
of
hopelessness
of
perpetual
were
of
aid
to
her
now
three
months
had
passed
without
a
word
from
her
which
directly
revived
the
old
sorrows
her
own
fear
of
trenching
on
indiscretion
found
an
ally
in
wilfrid
habitual
gravity
her
remark
at
their
meeting
on
his
mood
was
in
allusion
to
a
standing
pleasantry
between
them
she
had
complained
that
he
seldom
looked
really
happy
in
her
presence
it
was
true
his
bearing
as
a
rule
was
more
than
sober
beatrice
tormented
herself
to
explain
this
he
was
not
in
ordinary
intercourse
so
persistently
serious
though
far
more
so
than
he
had
been
in
earlier
years
the
change
dating
as
beatrice
too
well
had
marked
from
the
time
of
his
supreme
misery
with
the
natural
and
becoming
gravity
of
mature
age
there
mingled
a
very
perceptible
strain
of
melancholy
you
felt
it
in
his
laugh
which
was
seldom
hearty
it
made
his
sprightliness
in
social
hours
more
than
it
might
have
been
beatrice
had
always
felt
towards
him
a
very
real
humility
even
when
the
goading
of
her
unrequited
love
drove
her
into
a
show
of
scornful
opposition
herself
conscious
of
but
average
intelligence
and
without
studious
inclinations
she
endowed
him
with
acquisitions
as
vast
as
they
were
vague
to
her
discernment
she
knew
that
it
would
always
lie
beyond
her
power
to
be
his
intellectual
companion
therefore
she
desired
to
be
before
everything
womanly
in
his
eyes
to
make
the
note
of
pure
sentiment
predominate
in
their
private
relations
to
each
other
she
had
but
won
him
by
her
artistic
faculty
she
could
not
depend
upon
that
to
retain
and
deepen
his
affection
her
constant
apprehension
was
lest
familiarity
should
diminish
her
charm
in
his
eyes
wilfrid
was
no
less
critical
than
he
had
ever
been
she
suspected
that
he
required
much
of
her
did
he
seek
more
than
she
would
eventually
be
able
to
give
was
she
exhausting
the
resources
of
her
personal
charm
such
thoughts
as
these
made
curious
alternations
in
her
manner
towards
him
one
day
she
would
endeavour
to
support
a
reserve
which
should
surpass
his
own
another
she
lost
herself
in
bursts
of
emotion
the
very
care
which
she
bestowed
upon
her
personal
appearance
was
a
result
of
her
anxiety
on
this
point
in
the
last
resort
she
knew
herself
to
be
beautiful
and
to
her
beauty
he
was
anything
but
insensible
yet
such
an
influence
was
wretchedly
insufficient
she
must
have
his
uttermost
love
and
never
yet
had
she
attained
full
assurance
of
possessing
it
little
did
wilfrid
suspect
the
extent
to
which
her
thoughts
were
occupied
with
that
faint
figure
of
emily
hood
it
was
her
despair
that
she
had
known
emily
so
slightly
she
would
have
desired
to
study
to
the
depths
the
woman
who
had
possessed
such
a
secret
of
power
in
personal
charm
emily
could
not
compare
with
her
and
yet
the
distinction
struck
her
hard
that
was
perhaps
only
true
if
personal
charm
merely
meant
charm
of
person
for
she
herself
had
experienced
something
of
the
strange
impressiveness
which
men
men
of
imagination
submitted
to
in
emily
presence
where
did
it
lie
this
magic
it
was
indefinite
indefinable
perhaps
a
tone
of
the
voice
represented
it
perhaps
a
smile
which
meant
of
course
that
it
was
inseparable
from
her
being
from
her
womanhood
could
one
attribute
to
emily
even
after
the
briefest
acquaintance
a
thought
an
instinct
which
conflicted
with
the
ideal
of
womanly
purity
was
not
her
loveliness
of
the
soul
moreover
she
was
intellectual
beyond
ordinary
women
for
wilfrid
that
must
have
been
a
rich
source
of
attraction
scarcely
less
than
the
image
of
wilfrid
himself
was
that
of
emily
a
haunting
presence
in
beatrice
life
recently
she
had
spoken
of
her
both
with
birks
and
baxendale
it
cost
her
something
to
do
so
but
both
of
these
had
known
emily
with
intimacy
and
might
perhaps
tell
her
more
than
she
herself
remembered
or
could
divine
birks
was
disposed
to
treat
emily
with
little
seriousness
make
the
strangest
mistake
she
said
you
think
that
was
anything
but
a
boy
folly
to
be
sure
the
folly
got
very
near
the
point
of
madness
that
was
because
opposition
came
in
its
way
wilfrid
has
for
years
thought
as
little
of
her
as
of
the
man
in
the
moon
wife
if
he
has
one
you
are
surely
not
troubling
yourself
what
beatrice
had
thereupon
retired
into
herself
misunderstand
me
she
said
rather
coldly
was
only
a
recollection
of
something
that
had
seemed
strange
to
me
at
the
time
baxendale
held
another
tone
but
even
she
was
not
altogether
sincere
naturally
it
was
impossible
to
be
so
to
begin
with
she
gave
beatrice
to
understand
even
as
she
had
wilfrid
that
she
had
now
for
some
time
lost
sight
of
emily
and
consequently
that
the
latter
was
less
actually
interesting
to
her
than
was
in
fact
the
case
with
her
aunt
beatrice
could
be
more
unreserved
she
began
by
plainly
asking
whether
baxendale
thought
wilfrid
regret
had
been
of
long
endurance
a
woman
in
beatrice
position
clearly
could
not
in
talking
to
another
even
suppose
the
case
that
the
regret
still
endured
her
aunt
honestly
replied
that
she
believed
he
had
suffered
long
and
severely
she
added
with
characteristic
tact
did
not
need
this
instance
my
dear
to
prove
to
me
that
a
first
love
may
be
only
a
preparation
for
that
which
is
to
last
through
life
i
could
tell
you
stories
but
i
have
my
grandmother
cap
on
at
present
baxendale
was
in
truth
a
grandmother
by
this
time
and
professed
to
appreciate
the
authority
she
derived
from
the
circumstance
that
had
drawn
beatrice
out
was
very
weak
i
really
do
know
which
mused
beatrice
was
a
problem
to
you
you
never
troubled
yourself
to
puzzle
over
my
character
aunt
a
stream
is
of
lovely
clearness
beatrice
we
do
not
find
it
hard
to
determine
the
kind
of
ground
it
flows
over
will
owe
you
a
kiss
for
that
said
the
girl
blushing
hot
with
very
joy
you
are
a
flatterer
dear
aunt
and
just
now
i
am
very
humble
in
spirit
i
think
great
happiness
should
make
us
humble
do
you
i
find
it
hard
to
make
out
my
claim
to
it
humble
still
dear
and
the
happiness
will
not
be
withdrawn
do
like
to
talk
with
you
beatrice
replied
never
go
away
without
something
worth
thinking
of
humility
she
strove
to
nourish
it
was
a
prime
virtue
of
woman
and
sweeten
her
being
unlike
emily
she
was
not
inspired
with
an
ardent
idealism
independently
of
her
affections
with
love
had
begun
her
conscious
and
love
alone
exalted
her
her
many
frivolous
tendencies
she
had
only
overcome
by
dint
of
long
endeavour
to
approach
wilfrid
standard
if
in
one
way
this
was
an
item
of
strength
in
another
it
indicated
a
very
real
and
always
menacing
weakness
having
gained
that
to
which
her
every
instinct
had
directed
itself
she
made
the
possession
of
her
bliss
an
indispensable
factor
of
life
to
lose
it
would
be
to
fall
into
nether
darkness
into
despair
of
good
so
widowed
there
would
be
no
support
in
herself
she
knew
it
and
the
knowledge
at
moments
terrified
her
even
her
religious
convictions
once
very
real
and
strong
had
become
subordinate
her
creed
though
she
durst
not
confess
it
was
that
of
earthly
love
formerly
she
had
been
thrown
back
on
religious
emotion
as
a
solace
an
anodyne
for
that
reason
the
tendencies
inherited
from
her
mother
had
at
one
time
reached
a
climax
of
fanaticism
of
late
years
music
had
been
her
resource
the
more
efficient
in
that
it
ministered
to
hope
by
degrees
even
her
charitable
activity
had
diminished
since
her
mother
death
she
had
abandoned
the
habit
of
visiting
as
confidence
of
the
one
supreme
attainment
grew
in
her
the
mere
accessories
of
her
moral
life
were
allowed
to
fall
away
she
professed
no
change
of
opinion
indeed
under
went
none
but
opinion
became
as
with
most
women
distinct
from
practice
she
still
pretended
to
rejoice
as
often
as
she
persuaded
wilfrid
to
go
to
church
but
it
was
noticeable
that
she
willingly
allowed
his
preference
for
the
better
choral
services
and
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
the
service
was
only
of
full
efficacy
when
performed
together
with
her
me
die
now
it
is
only
for
this
that
i
have
lived
the
cry
came
from
her
very
heart
for
once
wilfrid
had
been
overcome
had
thrown
off
his
rather
wooing
had
uttered
such
words
as
her
soul
yearned
for
yet
she
had
scarcely
time
to
savour
her
rapture
before
that
jealousy
of
the
past
mingled
itself
with
the
sensation
even
such
words
as
these
he
must
have
used
to
and
had
they
not
perchance
come
more
readily
to
his
lips
was
he
by
nature
so
reserved
or
the
more
probable
thing
was
it
that
she
failed
at
other
times
to
inspire
him
how
had
been
used
to
behave
to
speak
in
her
incessant
brooding
upon
the
details
of
wilfrid
first
affection
beatrice
had
found
one
point
which
never
lost
its
power
to
distract
her
it
was
the
thought
of
all
the
correspondence
that
must
have
passed
between
him
and
emily
what
had
become
of
those
letters
had
they
been
mutually
returned
it
was
impossible
to
discover
not
even
to
her
aunt
could
she
put
such
a
question
as
that
and
it
might
very
well
be
that
baxendale
knew
nothing
certainly
if
the
story
as
she
beatrice
had
heard
it
was
quite
accurate
it
seemed
natural
to
suppose
that
emily
had
requested
to
have
her
letters
returned
to
her
when
she
declared
that
the
engagement
must
be
at
an
end
but
wilfrid
had
refused
to
accept
that
declaration
and
would
he
not
also
have
refused
to
let
the
writing
which
was
so
precious
to
him
leave
his
hands
in
that
case
he
probably
had
the
letters
still
perhaps
he
still
read
them
at
times
would
it
be
possible
even
after
marriage
to
speak
of
such
a
subject
with
wilfrid
she
had
constantly
tried
to
assure
herself
that
even
if
he
had
kept
the
pledges
through
all
these
years
a
sense
of
honour
would
lead
wilfrid
to
destroy
them
when
he
gave
and
received
a
new
love
in
moments
when
it
was
her
conscious
effort
to
rise
to
noble
heights
to
be
as
pure
a
woman
as
that
other
for
beatrice
never
sought
the
base
comfort
of
refusing
to
her
rival
that
just
homage
she
half
persuade
herself
that
no
doubt
lingered
in
her
mind
it
was
right
to
destroy
the
letters
and
whatever
was
right
wilfrid
must
have
done
but
she
could
not
live
at
all
hours
in
that
thin
air
the
defects
of
her
blood
were
too
enduring
jealousy
came
back
from
its
brief
exile
and
was
more
insinuating
than
ever
its
suggestions
more
maddening
by
a
sort
of
reaction
these
thoughts
assailed
her
strongly
in
the
moments
which
followed
her
outburst
of
passion
and
wilfrid
response
yet
she
could
not
durst
not
frame
words
to
tell
him
of
her
suffering
it
was
to
risk
too
much
it
might
strike
a
fatal
blow
at
his
respect
for
her
even
those
last
words
she
had
breathed
with
dread
involuntarily
already
perhaps
she
had
failed
in
the
delicacy
he
looked
for
and
had
given
him
matter
for
disagreeable
thought
as
soon
as
he
left
her
she
rose
at
length
from
her
kneeling
attitude
and
leaned
back
in
her
chair
with
a
look
of
trouble
scarcely
veiled
wilfrid
did
not
notice
it
he
had
already
begun
to
think
of
other
matters
he
began
a
subject
i
have
avoided
speaking
of
thinking
you
might
perhaps
be
the
first
to
mention
it
do
you
wish
to
continue
your
singing
she
smiled
and
did
not
seem
to
attach
great
importance
to
the
question
is
for
you
to
decide
she
answered
know
why
i
began
it
i
am
ready
to
say
my
farewell
whenever
you
bid
me
what
is
your
own
feeling
i
suppose
you
would
in
any
case
cease
at
our
marriage
are
not
ashamed
of
it
is
true
he
replied
humorously
i
am
a
member
of
the
british
house
of
commons
but
i
beg
you
wo
think
too
meanly
of
me
i
protest
that
i
have
still
something
of
my
old
self
means
you
are
rather
proud
than
ashamed
how
long
she
went
on
to
ask
lowering
her
eyes
the
british
house
of
commons
likely
to
sit
the
talk
will
hold
out
for
some
seven
or
eight
weeks
longer
i
sing
the
two
remaining
engagements
if
i
take
no
more
after
those
be
sure
you
must
let
it
stand
so
then
she
fell
back
into
her
brooding
i
too
have
something
to
ask
she
said
after
a
short
silence
you
ask
is
already
granted
be
too
hasty
it
more
than
you
think
want
you
to
give
me
some
work
to
do
for
you
to
let
me
come
and
sit
with
you
in
your
study
some
mornings
and
things
for
you
wilfrid
laughed
cheerily
i
had
a
regard
for
my
dignity
he
said
certainly
should
let
you
what
will
become
of
my
pretence
of
work
when
you
are
let
into
the
secrets
but
come
by
all
means
you
shall
digest
a
for
me
morning
you
will
beatrice
was
satisfied
chapter
xxi
dangerous
relics
is
coming
to
act
as
my
secretary
this
morning
wilfrid
said
to
his
father
as
they
sat
at
breakfast
on
monday
she
remarked
athel
drily
had
struck
me
that
you
were
not
very
busy
just
now
he
added
by
way
of
natural
comment
the
junior
smiled
the
way
she
has
only
two
more
engagements
then
it
ceases
am
glad
to
hear
it
said
his
father
with
much
satisfaction
all
observed
wilfrid
must
remember
that
everyone
knows
she
does
sing
for
a
living
art
you
know
is
only
contemptible
when
it
supports
the
artist
well
file
your
epigrams
by
all
means
but
we
live
in
the
world
wilf
criticise
as
smartly
as
you
like
the
danger
only
begins
when
you
act
upon
your
convictions
at
ten
beatrice
arrived
she
came
into
the
study
with
a
morning
colour
on
her
cheeks
threw
off
her
mantle
and
hat
and
let
wilfrid
draw
off
her
gloves
which
somehow
took
a
long
time
in
the
doing
she
was
full
of
bright
happy
talk
most
of
it
tending
to
show
that
she
had
already
given
the
attention
to
the
morning
which
was
becoming
in
a
politician
betrothed
you
smoke
whilst
you
are
at
work
she
asked
descending
from
those
high
themes
allow
myself
a
few
cigarettes
surely
that
is
too
frivolous
an
accompaniment
it
is
only
when
i
am
musing
upon
the
arguments
of
the
opposition
see
beatrice
took
the
reply
quite
seriously
where
is
the
you
want
me
to
digest
wilfrid
shook
his
head
looking
at
her
with
a
smile
think
me
incompetent
but
at
least
try
me
i
sha
spoil
anything
illustration
drawn
from
the
art
of
millinery
i
imagine
be
unkind
i
afraid
you
would
let
me
write
your
letters
jove
an
excellent
idea
here
one
of
the
free
and
independent
electors
of
g
writes
to
ask
what
my
views
are
on
the
subject
of
compulsory
vaccination
do
pen
a
reply
and
i
sign
it
what
am
i
to
say
ghost
of
jenner
alone
knows
i
offer
it
as
an
opportunity
to
show
your
fitness
for
this
post
you
have
applied
to
me
for
work
miss
miss
redwing
i
think
your
name
is
he
assumed
the
air
of
one
applied
to
is
sir
come
that
far
too
jaunty
you
do
at
all
understand
the
position
of
the
person
applying
for
work
you
must
be
profoundly
depressed
there
must
be
half
a
tear
in
your
eye
you
must
look
hungry
dear
i
had
such
an
excellent
breakfast
clearly
disqualifies
you
for
the
post
you
seek
however
miss
miss
redwing
i
think
you
said
did
sir
better
the
applicant
must
always
be
a
little
ashamed
of
his
name
they
learn
that
you
know
from
the
way
in
which
they
are
addressed
by
employers
well
i
give
you
a
hint
tell
him
he
an
ass
or
he
would
have
needed
to
ask
my
opinion
am
to
put
that
into
parliamentary
language
say
nothing
more
definite
miss
miss
redwing
i
begin
to
doubt
the
genuineness
of
your
testimonials
you
surely
have
learnt
that
the
first
essential
of
the
art
of
public
is
to
say
nothing
whatever
in
as
convincing
a
manner
as
possible
if
i
tell
him
he
a
a
donkey
fear
it
will
be
deviating
into
truth
there
something
in
that
say
then
that
the
matter
is
occupying
my
gravest
attention
and
that
i
hope
to
be
able
to
reply
definitely
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
well
where
may
i
sit
but
i
ca
use
a
quill
dear
boy
redwing
i
forgot
myself
have
you
a
nice
fine
point
not
too
hard
me
see
wilfrid
unlocked
one
of
the
drawers
in
his
desk
as
he
drew
it
out
beatrice
stole
to
him
and
peeped
into
the
drawer
neat
wilfrid
she
exclaimed
a
pretty
that
is
lying
there
do
let
me
look
at
it
it
was
a
morocco
case
with
an
elastic
band
round
it
beatrice
stretched
her
hand
towards
it
but
he
arrested
her
movement
no
he
said
playfully
ca
have
prying
here
are
the
pens
do
let
me
look
at
the
case
wilfrid
he
began
to
close
the
drawer
beatrice
laid
her
hand
on
it
aunt
gave
it
me
long
ago
wilfrid
said
as
if
to
dismiss
the
subject
i
shall
trap
your
fingers
sure
you
wo
do
that
but
i
do
want
to
see
it
the
smell
of
morocco
is
so
delicious
just
one
whiff
of
it
you
want
to
smell
it
not
to
see
it
if
you
good
you
shall
before
you
go
away
but
now
wilfrid
he
was
pretending
to
squeeze
her
fingers
in
the
shutting
of
the
drawer
she
would
not
undo
her
grasp
may
i
wilfrid
she
looked
at
him
his
expression
was
graver
than
became
the
incident
he
was
trying
to
smile
but
beatrice
saw
that
his
eyes
and
lips
were
agitated
may
i
she
repeated
if
you
insist
he
exclaimed
moving
back
a
step
or
two
course
you
may
she
took
up
the
case
and
looked
at
it
on
either
side
are
letters
in
it
she
said
without
raising
her
eyes
i
believe
there
are
letters
in
it
i
suppose
daresay
i
suppose
i
had
some
reason
for
putting
them
there
he
spoke
with
apparent
indifference
and
turned
to
light
a
cigarette
beatrice
put
back
the
case
and
closed
the
drawer
is
wilfrid
said
holding
some
to
her
she
took
it
in
silence
and
seated
herself
wilfrid
at
tempted
to
pursue
the
jest
but
she
could
not
reply
she
sat
as
if
about
to
her
eyes
were
drooped
and
her
mouth
had
set
itself
hard
wilfrid
affected
to
turn
over
papers
in
search
for
something
still
standing
before
the
table
find
it
difficult
to
begin
he
said
call
him
dear
sir
society
depends
upon
that
dear
word
easily
used
remarked
beatrice
in
a
low
voice
as
if
she
were
thinking
he
cast
a
glance
at
her
then
seated
himself
he
was
at
the
side
of
the
table
she
at
the
end
after
a
moment
of
silence
she
leaned
forward
to
him
she
said
trying
to
smile
letters
are
those
dear
what
possible
moment
can
that
be
to
you
beatrice
seems
i
ca
help
thinking
they
are
letters
which
you
value
particularly
might
i
not
know
he
looked
away
to
the
window
course
if
you
tell
me
i
am
rude
beatrice
continued
pressing
her
pen
point
upon
the
table
have
no
answer
yes
he
replied
at
length
as
if
having
taken
a
resolve
are
letters
of
that
i
have
put
apart
for
a
special
reason
and
now
shall
we
forget
them
his
tone
was
not
altogether
suave
about
his
nostrils
there
was
a
suspicion
of
defiance
he
forced
himself
to
meet
her
gaze
steadily
the
effort
killed
a
smile
will
cease
to
speak
of
them
beatrice
answered
implying
a
distinction
a
minute
later
he
saw
that
she
laid
down
her
pen
and
rose
he
looked
up
inquiringly
do
feel
able
to
do
anything
this
morning
she
said
wilfrid
made
no
reply
she
went
to
the
chair
on
which
her
hat
and
mantle
lay
are
not
going
he
asked
in
a
tone
of
surprise
think
so
i
ca
be
of
use
to
you
she
added
impulsively
have
not
your
confidence
he
let
her
throw
the
mantle
over
her
shoulders
surely
this
is
not
the
result
of
such
a
trifle
look
he
pulled
open
the
drawer
once
more
and
threw
the
on
to
the
table
that
had
lain
there
when
you
came
into
this
room
alone
should
you
have
opened
it
and
examined
the
contents
should
not
you
know
it
well
you
would
simply
have
taken
it
for
granted
that
i
was
to
be
trusted
to
look
after
my
own
affairs
until
i
asked
someone
else
aid
or
advice
is
not
that
the
case
at
present
a
man
more
apt
at
dissimulation
would
have
treated
the
matter
from
the
first
with
joking
irony
and
might
have
carried
his
point
though
with
difficulty
wilfrid
had
not
the
aptitude
to
begin
with
and
he
was
gravely
disturbed
his
pulses
were
throbbing
scarcely
could
he
steady
his
voice
he
dreaded
a
disclosure
of
what
might
well
be
regarded
as
throwing
doubt
upon
his
sincerity
the
more
so
that
he
understood
in
this
moment
how
justifiable
such
a
doubt
would
be
after
the
merriment
of
a
few
minutes
ago
this
sudden
shaking
of
his
nerves
was
the
harder
to
endure
it
revived
with
painful
intensity
the
first
great
agitations
of
his
life
his
way
of
speaking
could
not
but
confirm
suspicions
are
not
exactly
strangers
to
each
other
she
said
coldly
we
are
not
yet
i
think
i
should
have
forborne
to
press
you
on
any
matter
you
thought
it
needless
to
speak
of
she
put
on
her
hat
wilfrid
felt
his
anger
rising
our
natural
emotion
when
we
are
disagreeably
in
the
wrong
yet
can
not
condemn
the
cause
which
has
made
us
so
he
sat
to
the
table
again
as
if
his
part
in
the
discussion
were
at
an
end
beatrice
stood
for
some
moments
then
came
quickly
to
his
side
have
you
secrets
from
me
she
asked
the
tremor
of
her
voice
betraying
the
anguish
that
her
suspicions
cost
her
i
am
it
was
so
at
first
i
ought
to
have
said
anything
but
now
it
has
become
something
different
however
trifling
the
matter
i
ca
bear
that
you
should
refuse
to
treat
me
as
yourself
there
is
nothing
nothing
i
could
keep
from
you
i
have
not
a
secret
in
my
life
to
hide
from
you
it
is
not
because
they
are
letters
or
not
only
that
you
put
a
distance
between
us
you
say
there
are
affairs
of
yours
in
which
i
have
no
concern
i
can
not
bear
that
if
i
leave
you
i
shall
suffer
more
than
you
dream
i
thought
we
were
one
is
not
your
love
as
complete
as
mine
he
rose
and
moved
away
saying
it
look
at
the
letters
that
i
ca
do
what
can
it
be
that
troubles
you
so
are
they
letters
that
i
not
to
see
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
answered
brusquely
suppose
they
are
mean
that
you
have
preserved
letters
which
as
often
as
you
open
that
drawer
remind
you
of
someone
else
that
you
purposely
keep
them
so
near
your
hand
i
had
no
right
to
destroy
them
right
her
eyes
flashed
and
her
tongue
trembled
with
its
scorn
mean
you
had
no
wish
i
had
no
right
i
could
scarcely
have
the
wish
wilfrid
was
amazed
at
his
own
contemptible
quibbling
but
in
truth
he
was
not
equal
to
the
occasion
he
could
not
defend
himself
in
choice
phrases
in
a
sort
of
desperate
carelessness
he
flung
out
the
first
retort
that
offered
itself
he
was
on
the
point
of
throwing
over
everything
of
declaring
that
all
must
be
at
an
end
between
them
yet
courage
failed
for
that
nor
courage
only
the
woman
before
him
was
very
grand
in
her
indignation
her
pale
face
was
surpassingly
beautiful
the
past
faded
in
comparison
with
her
in
his
heart
he
doubted
of
its
power
beatrice
was
gazing
at
him
in
resentful
wonder
have
you
done
this
she
asked
did
you
come
to
me
and
speak
those
words
what
necessity
was
there
to
pretend
what
you
did
not
feel
he
met
her
eyes
have
not
spoken
falsely
to
you
he
said
with
calmness
which
did
not
strengthen
the
impression
his
words
were
meant
to
convey
you
said
that
you
loved
me
if
it
were
true
you
could
not
have
borne
to
have
those
letters
under
your
eyes
you
say
you
had
no
right
to
destroy
them
you
knew
that
it
was
your
duty
to
do
so
you
have
kept
them
wilfrid
had
become
almost
his
heart
was
torn
in
two
ways
he
wished
to
take
the
letters
from
their
case
and
destroy
them
at
once
probably
it
was
masculine
pride
which
now
kept
him
from
doing
it
think
you
must
believe
what
i
say
beatrice
was
his
answer
am
not
capable
of
deliberately
lying
to
you
are
not
but
you
are
capable
of
deceiving
yourself
i
accuse
you
of
nothing
more
you
have
deceived
yourself
and
i
have
been
the
cause
of
it
for
i
had
so
little
of
woman
pride
that
i
let
you
see
my
love
it
was
as
if
i
begged
for
your
love
in
return
my
own
heart
should
have
taught
me
better
there
can
be
no
second
love
you
pitied
me
wilfrid
was
in
no
state
of
mind
to
weigh
phrases
at
a
later
time
when
he
could
look
back
with
calmness
and
with
the
advantage
of
extended
knowledge
he
recognised
in
these
words
the
uttermost
confession
of
love
of
a
woman
is
capable
in
hearing
them
he
simply
took
them
as
a
reproach
such
a
thing
had
been
possible
he
said
would
have
been
a
horrible
injustice
to
you
i
asked
you
to
be
my
wife
because
i
loved
you
the
existence
of
these
letters
is
no
proof
that
i
misunderstood
my
own
feeling
there
are
many
things
we
can
not
explain
to
another
on
the
moment
you
must
judge
the
facts
as
you
will
but
no
hasty
and
obvious
judgment
will
hit
the
truth
she
was
not
listening
to
him
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
letters
and
over
her
heart
there
crept
a
desire
which
all
but
expelled
other
feeling
a
desire
to
know
what
was
there
written
she
would
have
given
her
hand
to
be
alone
in
the
room
with
that
now
that
she
knew
what
it
contained
no
scruple
would
have
withheld
her
the
impossibility
that
her
longing
could
ever
be
satisfied
frenzied
her
with
jealousy
will
leave
you
with
them
she
exclaimed
speaking
her
thought
do
not
want
me
i
come
between
you
and
her
read
and
forget
me
read
them
once
more
and
see
then
if
you
do
not
understand
yourself
i
know
now
why
you
have
often
been
so
cold
why
it
cost
you
an
effort
to
reply
to
me
you
shall
never
have
that
trouble
again
she
moved
to
quit
the
room
wilfrid
called
her
stay
and
listen
to
me
these
letters
are
nothing
and
mean
nothing
stay
and
see
me
burn
them
irrational
as
it
was
she
could
not
bear
to
see
them
destroyed
in
her
distracted
mind
there
was
a
sort
of
crazy
hope
that
he
would
at
last
give
them
to
her
to
burn
she
might
even
perhaps
have
brought
herself
to
take
them
away
is
childish
she
said
know
them
by
heart
the
burning
of
the
paper
would
alter
nothing
i
can
say
and
do
no
more
it
had
been
like
a
rending
of
his
heartstrings
to
offer
to
destroy
these
memories
of
emily
though
he
at
the
same
time
persuaded
himself
that
once
done
he
would
be
a
stronger
and
a
happier
man
in
truth
they
had
made
the
chief
strength
of
the
link
between
him
and
the
past
every
day
they
had
reminded
him
how
much
of
the
old
feeling
lingered
in
his
being
the
sanctity
with
which
these
relics
were
invested
testified
to
the
holiness
of
the
worship
which
had
bequeathed
them
he
had
not
opened
the
case
since
his
betrothal
to
beatrice
and
scarcely
a
day
passed
that
he
did
not
purpose
hiding
it
somewhere
away
for
ever
not
destroying
beatrice
answer
to
his
offer
caused
him
half
to
repent
that
he
had
made
it
he
turned
away
from
her
she
after
looking
at
the
still
for
some
moments
seemed
to
force
herself
away
he
heard
her
open
the
door
and
did
not
try
to
stay
her
half
an
hour
later
wilfrid
restored
the
letters
to
their
place
in
the
drawer
if
they
were
to
be
destroyed
it
must
now
be
in
presence
with
something
like
joy
he
turned
the
key
upon
them
feeling
that
they
were
preserved
that
the
last
farewell
was
once
again
postponed
wilfrid
was
not
a
very
strong
man
where
sacrifice
demanded
of
him
he
neither
saw
nor
heard
from
beatrice
till
the
evening
of
the
following
day
then
it
happened
that
they
had
to
dine
at
the
same
house
on
meeting
her
in
the
he
gave
her
his
hand
as
usual
hers
returned
no
pressure
she
seemed
as
cheerful
as
ever
in
her
talk
with
others
him
she
kept
apart
from
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
write
she
had
refused
to
accept
such
proof
of
his
sincerity
as
it
wag
in
his
power
to
offer
and
wilfrid
made
this
an
excuse
idle
as
he
knew
it
to
be
for
maintaining
a
dignified
silence
dignified
he
allowed
himself
to
name
it
yet
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
his
attitude
had
one
very
ignoble
aspect
since
he
all
but
consciously
counted
upon
love
to
bring
her
back
to
his
feet
he
said
to
himself
let
her
interpret
my
silence
as
she
will
if
she
regard
it
as
evidence
of
inability
to
face
her
well
i
make
no
objection
the
conviction
all
the
while
grew
in
him
that
he
did
veritably
love
her
for
he
felt
that
but
for
his
knowledge
of
her
utter
devotedness
he
would
now
be
in
fear
lest
he
should
lose
her
such
fear
need
not
occupy
a
thought
a
word
and
she
flew
to
him
he
enjoyed
this
sense
of
power
to
draw
out
the
misunderstanding
a
little
would
make
reconciliation
all
the
pleasanter
then
the
letters
should
flame
into
ashes
and
with
them
vanish
even
the
regret
for
the
blessedness
they
had
promised
wednesday
morning
and
still
no
letter
from
beatrice
athel
joked
about
her
speedy
resignation
of
the
secretaryship
wilfrid
joined
in
the
joke
and
decided
that
he
would
wait
one
more
day
knowing
not
what
a
day
might
bring
forth
chapter
xxii
her
path
in
the
shadow
yielding
to
the
urgency
of
beatrice
who
was
supported
in
her
entreaty
by
birks
wilfrid
had
a
little
ere
this
consented
to
sit
for
his
portrait
to
an
artist
a
friend
of
the
family
who
had
already
made
a
very
successful
picture
of
beatrice
herself
the
artist
resided
at
teddington
wilfrid
was
due
for
a
sitting
this
wednesday
morning
and
he
went
down
into
the
country
intending
to
be
back
for
lunch
and
the
house
of
commons
but
the
weather
was
magnificent
and
the
sitting
over
truant
thoughts
began
to
assail
the
young
legislator
bushey
park
was
at
hand
with
its
chestnut
avenue
leading
to
hampton
court
a
ramble
of
indefinite
duration
was
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
much
more
attractive
than
the
eloquence
of
independent
members
he
determined
to
take
a
holiday
a
very
leisurely
stroll
across
the
park
brought
him
to
the
king
arms
and
the
sight
of
the
hostelry
suggested
pleasant
thoughts
of
sundry
refreshing
viands
and
cooling
liquors
he
entered
and
lunched
it
was
a
holiday
and
a
truant
holiday
he
allowed
himself
champagne
when
he
came
forth
again
his
intention
to
stroll
through
the
galleries
of
the
palace
had
given
way
before
the
remembered
shadow
of
the
chestnuts
he
returned
to
the
park
and
after
idly
watching
the
fish
in
the
shallow
water
of
the
round
lake
strayed
away
into
cool
retreats
where
the
grass
irresistibly
invited
to
recumbency
he
threw
himself
down
and
let
his
eyes
dream
upon
the
delicate
blades
and
stalks
and
leafage
which
one
so
seldom
regards
if
he
chose
to
gaze
further
there
were
fair
tracts
of
shadowed
sward
with
sunny
gleamings
scattered
where
the
trees
were
thinner
and
above
him
the
heaven
of
clustering
leaves
here
of
impenetrable
there
a
rustling
whisper
in
the
air
and
on
the
ground
was
the
only
voice
that
came
thither
he
had
set
himself
to
think
of
beatrice
he
purposed
writing
her
a
long
letter
wherein
he
would
do
his
best
to
make
her
understand
the
light
in
which
the
past
appeared
to
him
and
how
little
those
memories
had
to
do
with
the
present
and
its
love
and
its
duty
to
be
sure
he
could
not
use
the
words
of
very
truth
he
would
much
have
preferred
to
speak
with
unflinching
honesty
to
confess
that
he
had
even
of
late
often
dwelt
on
the
thought
of
emily
with
tenderness
with
something
of
but
that
the
new
love
had
for
all
that
triumphed
over
the
old
and
would
henceforth
grow
to
perfectness
but
the
character
of
beatrice
would
not
allow
this
in
her
feeling
was
too
predominant
over
intellect
she
could
not
recognise
in
this
very
frankness
the
assurance
of
an
affection
which
would
end
by
being
no
less
than
the
utmost
she
demanded
he
had
to
seek
for
subtleties
of
explanation
for
ingenuities
of
argument
which
unsatisfactory
as
they
seemed
to
himself
might
yet
he
thought
help
her
to
the
reconciliation
he
knew
she
desired
he
was
scarcely
less
anxious
for
it
for
beatrice
he
would
never
know
that
limitless
passion
that
infinite
yearning
alike
of
spirit
and
of
sense
which
had
been
his
love
for
emily
but
she
was
very
dear
to
him
and
with
all
his
heart
he
desired
to
make
her
happiness
he
imaged
her
beauty
and
her
talent
with
pride
which
made
his
veins
warmer
her
husband
he
would
be
loyal
to
his
last
breath
community
of
life
would
establish
that
intimate
alliance
of
heart
and
soul
which
every
year
makes
more
enduring
were
they
not
young
flesh
and
blood
he
and
she
and
could
a
bodiless
ghost
come
between
them
a
mere
voice
of
time
insubstantial
unseizable
as
the
murmur
in
these
he
grew
tired
of
the
attitude
which
at
first
had
been
reposeful
and
rose
to
wander
further
someone
else
it
seemed
had
been
tempted
to
this
quiet
corner
away
from
the
road
a
woman
was
walking
at
a
little
distance
and
reading
as
she
walked
the
thought
passed
through
his
mind
that
a
woman
never
looked
more
graceful
than
when
walking
with
her
head
bent
over
a
book
when
he
looked
that
way
again
he
found
that
she
had
come
much
nearer
still
very
intent
upon
her
reading
she
had
in
truth
a
comely
figure
one
which
suggested
a
face
of
the
nobler
kind
she
would
look
up
presently
did
not
that
form
that
movement
as
she
walked
stir
memories
yes
he
had
known
someone
who
might
well
have
paced
thus
beneath
spreading
trees
with
her
eyes
upon
a
book
of
poetry
not
unlike
this
stranger
outwardly
in
what
black
skyless
leafless
town
was
she
pursuing
her
lonely
life
lonely
why
should
it
be
so
emily
could
not
go
on
her
way
without
meeting
one
whom
her
sweetness
and
her
power
would
enthral
and
the
reasons
whatever
they
were
that
had
forbidden
her
marriage
six
or
seven
years
ago
were
not
likely
to
resist
time
he
tried
to
hope
that
the
happier
lot
had
by
this
solaced
her
do
we
not
change
so
his
own
love
see
how
it
had
faded
half
purposely
he
had
turned
so
as
to
pass
near
the
reader
at
the
distance
of
a
few
yards
from
her
he
stayed
his
step
a
little
nearer
she
came
then
something
made
her
aware
of
his
presence
she
raised
her
eyes
the
eyes
of
emily
hood
her
hands
fell
one
still
holding
the
book
open
he
who
was
prepared
already
could
watch
her
countenance
change
from
placid
if
grave
thought
to
the
awakening
of
surprise
to
startled
recognition
he
could
see
the
colour
die
upon
her
cheeks
flee
from
her
lips
he
could
observe
the
great
heartthrobs
which
shook
her
and
left
her
bosom
quivering
he
did
not
uncover
his
head
conventional
courtesies
have
their
season
it
seemed
very
long
before
they
ceased
to
look
into
each
other
eyes
but
at
length
hers
fell
it
possible
that
you
are
living
in
london
were
wilfrid
first
words
he
could
affect
no
distance
of
manner
to
him
all
at
once
it
was
as
though
they
had
parted
a
few
days
ago
she
answered
simply
a
far
part
of
london
we
meet
here
where
i
seemed
to
find
myself
by
the
merest
chance
i
saw
a
stranger
in
the
distance
and
thought
of
yourself
i
knew
you
long
before
you
looked
up
from
your
reading
emily
tried
to
smile
little
you
are
changed
wilfrid
continued
his
voice
keeping
still
its
awed
quietness
with
of
feeling
you
are
not
changed
at
all
it
was
not
true
but
in
the
few
minutes
that
he
had
gazed
at
her
past
and
present
had
so
blended
that
he
could
not
see
what
another
would
have
noticed
emily
was
appreciably
older
and
had
set
marks
upon
her
face
a
stranger
looking
at
her
now
would
have
found
it
hard
to
imagine
her
with
the
light
of
joy
in
her
eyes
her
features
had
set
themselves
in
sorrow
her
cheeks
were
very
thin
her
eyes
were
dark
and
sunken
wilfrid
saw
only
the
soul
in
her
gaze
at
him
and
that
was
as
it
had
ever
been
she
was
unable
to
speak
wilfrid
found
words
you
often
walk
here
is
your
home
near
very
near
i
came
by
the
river
she
answered
am
very
glad
that
i
have
met
you
the
words
sounded
insufficient
but
wilfrid
was
by
this
time
at
battle
with
himself
and
succeeded
in
saying
less
than
he
felt
will
let
me
walk
on
a
little
way
with
you
we
ca
shake
hands
at
once
and
say
can
we
after
such
a
long
time
he
spoke
in
the
tone
one
uses
to
jest
over
bygone
sadness
emily
made
no
verbal
answer
but
walked
along
by
his
side
still
have
your
old
habits
he
said
casting
an
eye
at
the
book
your
tastes
still
the
same
i
wonder
is
dante
she
replied
the
name
brought
another
to
wilfrid
consciousness
he
averted
his
eyes
for
a
moment
but
spoke
again
without
much
delay
faithful
to
the
great
names
this
is
a
lovely
place
to
make
study
were
you
here
when
the
chestnuts
flowered
once
or
twice
did
not
see
them
this
year
and
you
have
been
walking
here
so
often
he
added
wondering
again
half
to
himself
have
been
to
teddington
several
times
lately
but
only
today
came
into
the
park
have
not
been
here
for
a
month
emily
said
speaking
at
length
with
more
case
the
shock
had
affected
her
physically
more
than
she
had
allowed
to
be
seen
it
was
only
now
that
her
voice
was
perfectly
at
her
command
her
face
remained
grave
but
she
spoke
in
a
tone
free
from
suggestion
of
melancholy
teach
in
a
school
and
there
is
a
holiday
you
live
at
the
school
i
have
my
own
lodgings
he
was
on
the
point
of
asking
whether
baxendale
knew
she
was
in
london
but
it
seemed
better
to
suppress
the
question
you
been
there
long
he
asked
instead
a
year
as
he
kept
silence
emily
continued
with
a
question
the
first
she
had
put
have
you
chosen
for
your
life
work
wilfrid
could
not
overcome
the
tendency
of
blood
to
his
cheeks
he
was
more
than
half
ashamed
to
tell
her
the
truth
will
laugh
at
me
he
said
am
in
parliament
are
i
never
see
newspapers
she
added
it
as
if
to
excuse
herself
for
not
being
aware
of
his
public
activity
i
am
still
far
from
being
a
subject
of
wilfrid
exclaimed
i
gave
you
no
answer
to
your
question
my
work
is
all
my
old
plans
have
come
to
nothing
and
i
have
formed
no
new
ones
no
serious
plans
my
life
will
be
a
failure
i
suppose
you
aim
at
success
in
politics
suppose
so
i
was
thinking
of
the
other
things
we
used
to
speak
of
emily
hazarded
a
glance
at
him
as
if
to
examine
him
again
in
this
new
light
used
to
say
she
continued
you
felt
in
many
ways
suited
for
a
political
life
i
you
mean
at
home
when
i
talked
in
a
foolish
way
it
was
not
my
serious
thought
i
never
said
it
to
you
she
murmured
a
they
walked
on
in
silence
did
read
italian
then
wilfrid
said
i
feel
sure
have
not
wasted
your
time
how
much
you
must
have
read
since
we
talked
over
our
favourite
authors
have
tried
to
keep
up
the
habit
of
study
emily
replied
unaffectedly
of
course
most
of
my
time
is
occupied
in
teaching
their
walk
had
brought
them
from
under
the
trees
and
the
lake
was
just
before
them
will
go
on
to
the
bridge
emily
said
boat
i
return
by
will
leave
shortly
she
spoke
as
if
expecting
him
to
take
leave
of
her
wilfrid
inwardly
bade
himself
do
so
he
had
seen
her
had
talked
with
her
what
more
for
either
yet
it
was
beyond
his
power
to
stand
here
and
see
her
walk
away
from
him
things
were
stirring
in
his
heart
and
mind
of
which
he
refused
to
take
cognisance
he
would
grant
nothing
more
than
a
sense
of
pleasure
in
hearing
once
again
a
voice
which
had
so
long
been
buried
and
there
was
no
harm
in
that
was
not
his
strongest
feeling
merely
surprise
at
having
met
her
thus
even
yet
he
found
a
difficulty
in
realising
that
it
was
she
with
whom
he
spoke
had
he
closed
his
eyes
and
then
looked
round
for
her
in
vain
it
would
only
have
appeared
the
natural
waking
from
intense
reverie
why
not
dream
on
as
long
as
he
might
i
not
walk
as
far
as
the
bridge
with
you
he
asked
i
were
not
afraid
of
being
tiresome
i
should
even
like
to
go
by
the
boat
it
would
be
the
pleasantest
way
of
getting
back
to
town
it
is
pleasant
on
the
river
emily
said
rather
absently
they
pursued
their
walk
together
and
conversed
still
much
in
the
same
way
wilfrid
learned
that
her
school
was
in
hammersmith
a
large
for
girls
he
led
her
to
speak
of
the
subjects
she
taught
and
of
her
pupils
prefer
it
he
asked
private
teaching
think
so
once
on
the
boat
their
talk
grew
less
consecutive
the
few
words
they
exchanged
now
and
then
were
suggested
by
objects
or
places
passed
at
length
even
these
remarks
ceased
and
for
the
last
they
held
silence
other
people
close
by
were
talking
noisily
emily
sat
with
both
hands
holding
the
book
upon
her
lap
her
eyes
seldom
moving
from
a
point
directly
before
her
wilfrid
glanced
at
her
frequently
he
was
more
observant
now
of
the
traces
of
bodily
weakness
in
her
he
saw
how
meagre
she
had
become
how
slight
her
whole
frame
was
at
moments
it
cost
him
a
serious
effort
to
refrain
from
leaning
to
her
and
whispering
words
he
knew
not
what
something
kind
something
that
should
change
her
fixed
sadness
why
had
he
forced
his
company
upon
her
certainly
he
brought
her
no
joy
and
presently
he
would
take
leave
of
her
as
any
slight
acquaintance
might
how
otherwise
it
would
have
been
better
to
part
there
by
the
lake
where
she
offered
the
occasion
the
steamer
reached
hammersmith
only
at
this
last
moment
he
seemed
to
understand
where
he
was
and
with
whom
that
emily
was
sitting
by
him
in
very
deed
here
by
his
side
and
directly
would
be
gone
he
knew
not
whither
scarcely
to
be
met
again
the
silence
between
them
had
come
of
the
difficulty
they
both
had
in
realising
that
they
were
together
of
the
dreaminess
so
strange
an
event
had
cast
upon
them
were
they
to
fall
apart
again
without
a
word
a
sign
a
sign
of
what
forsooth
wilfrid
moved
with
her
to
the
spot
at
which
she
would
step
from
the
deck
seeing
him
follow
emily
threw
back
one
startled
glance
the
next
moment
she
again
turned
holding
out
her
hand
he
took
it
held
it
pressed
it
nothing
could
restrain
that
pressure
his
muscles
closed
upon
her
slight
fingers
involuntarily
then
he
watched
her
walk
hurriedly
from
the
her
we
follow
she
had
a
walk
of
nearly
half
an
hour
which
brought
her
at
length
to
one
of
the
streets
of
small
which
abound
in
this
neighbourhood
and
to
a
door
which
she
opened
with
her
she
went
upstairs
here
two
rooms
were
her
home
that
which
looked
upon
the
street
was
furnished
in
the
poor
bare
style
which
the
exterior
of
the
dwelling
would
have
led
one
to
expect
a
very
hideous
screen
of
coloured
paper
hid
the
fireplace
and
in
front
of
the
small
oblong
mirror
cracked
across
one
corner
which
stood
above
the
mantelpiece
were
divers
ornaments
such
as
one
meets
with
in
poor
certain
pictures
about
the
walls
completed
the
effect
of
vulgarity
emily
let
herself
sink
upon
the
couch
and
lay
back
closing
her
eyes
she
had
thrown
off
her
hat
but
was
too
weary
too
absent
in
thought
to
remove
her
mantle
her
face
was
as
colourless
as
if
she
had
fainted
she
kept
one
hand
pressed
against
her
heart
unconsciously
she
had
walked
home
with
a
very
quick
step
and
quick
movement
caused
her
physical
suffering
she
sat
thus
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
there
came
a
tap
at
the
door
her
landlady
entered
i
thought
miss
hood
she
began
maybe
rung
the
bell
as
usual
and
i
had
heard
it
i
do
sometimes
think
i
getting
a
little
hard
of
hearing
my
husband
tell
me
of
it
will
you
have
the
tea
made
you
willis
emily
replied
rising
she
opened
a
low
cupboard
beside
the
fireplace
took
out
a
and
put
some
tea
into
it
have
a
long
walk
i
suppose
continued
the
woman
delightful
weather
for
it
too
but
you
must
mind
as
you
do
yourself
you
do
look
very
strong
if
i
may
say
it
i
am
very
well
was
the
mechanical
reply
after
a
few
more
remarks
the
landlady
took
away
the
teapot
emily
then
drew
out
a
cloth
from
the
cupboard
and
other
things
needful
for
her
evening
meal
presently
the
returned
filled
with
hot
water
emily
was
glad
to
pour
out
a
cup
and
drink
it
but
she
ate
nothing
in
a
short
time
she
rang
the
bell
to
have
the
things
removed
this
time
a
little
girl
appeared
miss
was
the
exclamation
of
the
child
on
examining
the
state
of
the
table
have
eaten
nothing
i
do
want
anything
just
now
milly
was
the
quiet
reply
i
leave
the
bread
and
butter
out
thank
you
i
have
some
later
there
anything
i
could
get
you
miss
milly
take
the
things
away
there
a
good
girl
emily
had
seated
herself
on
the
couch
again
when
the
girl
was
gone
she
lay
down
her
hands
beneath
her
head
long
long
since
she
had
had
so
much
to
think
of
as
at
first
she
had
found
wilfrid
a
good
deal
altered
he
looked
so
much
older
his
bearded
face
naturally
caused
that
but
before
he
had
spoken
twenty
words
how
well
she
knew
that
the
change
was
only
of
appearance
his
voice
was
a
little
deeper
but
the
tone
and
manner
of
his
speaking
carried
her
back
to
the
days
when
they
had
first
exchanged
words
when
she
was
a
governess
at
the
firs
in
surrey
and
wilfrid
was
the
interesting
young
fellow
who
had
overworked
himself
at
college
the
circumstances
of
meeting
had
reproduced
something
of
the
timidity
with
which
he
had
approached
her
when
they
were
strangers
this
afternoon
she
had
scarcely
looked
into
his
eyes
but
she
felt
their
gaze
upon
her
and
felt
their
power
as
of
old
ah
stronger
was
he
married
it
was
more
than
possible
nothing
had
escaped
him
inconsistent
with
that
and
he
was
not
likely
to
speak
of
it
directly
it
would
account
for
the
nature
of
his
embarrassment
in
talking
with
her
her
keen
insight
distinguished
something
more
than
the
hesitation
which
common
memories
would
naturally
cause
and
that
pressure
of
the
hand
at
parting
which
had
made
her
heart
leap
with
such
agony
might
well
be
his
way
of
intimating
to
her
that
this
meeting
would
have
no
sequel
was
it
to
be
expected
that
he
should
remain
unmarried
had
she
hoped
it
it
could
not
be
called
hope
but
for
two
or
three
years
something
had
grown
in
her
which
made
life
a
succession
of
alternating
longings
and
despairs
for
emily
was
not
so
constituted
that
the
phase
of
thought
and
feeling
which
had
been
brought
about
by
the
tragedy
of
her
home
could
perpetuate
itself
and
become
her
normal
consciousness
when
she
fled
from
dunfield
she
believed
that
the
impulses
then
so
strong
would
prevail
with
her
to
the
end
of
her
life
that
the
motives
which
were
then
predominant
in
her
soul
would
maintain
their
ruling
force
for
ever
and
many
months
went
by
before
she
suspected
that
her
imagination
had
deceived
her
imagination
ever
the
most
potent
factor
of
her
being
the
source
alike
of
her
strength
and
her
weakness
but
there
came
a
day
when
the
poignancy
of
her
grief
was
subdued
and
she
looked
around
her
upon
a
world
more
desolate
than
that
in
which
she
found
herself
on
the
day
of
her
mother
burial
she
began
to
know
once
more
that
she
was
young
and
that
existence
stretched
before
her
a
limitless
tract
of
barren
endurance
the
rare
natures
which
are
in
truth
ruled
by
the
instinct
of
renunciation
which
find
in
the
mortification
of
sense
a
spring
of
unearthly
joy
brimming
higher
with
each
may
experience
temptation
and
relapse
but
the
former
is
a
new
occasion
for
the
arming
of
the
spirit
and
the
latter
speedily
leads
to
a
remorse
which
is
the
strongest
of
all
incentives
to
ascetic
struggle
emily
had
not
upon
her
the
seal
of
sainthood
it
was
certain
that
at
some
point
of
her
life
asceticism
would
make
irresistible
claim
upon
the
strongholds
of
her
imagination
none
the
less
certain
that
it
would
be
but
for
a
time
that
it
would
prove
but
a
stage
in
her
development
to
her
misfortune
the
occasion
presented
itself
in
connection
with
her
strongest
native
affections
and
under
circumstances
which
led
her
to
an
irretrievable
act
had
she
been
brought
up
in
a
roman
catholic
country
she
would
doubtless
have
thrown
herself
into
a
convent
finding
her
stern
joy
in
the
thought
that
no
future
wavering
was
possible
attempting
to
make
a
convent
of
her
own
mind
she
soon
knew
too
well
that
her
efforts
mocked
her
that
there
was
in
her
an
instinct
stronger
than
that
of
renunciation
and
that
she
had
condemned
herself
to
a
life
of
futile
misery
her
state
of
mind
for
the
year
following
her
father
death
was
morbid
little
differing
from
madness
and
she
came
at
length
to
understand
that
when
time
had
tempered
her
anguish
she
saw
with
clear
eyes
that
her
acts
had
been
guided
by
hallucination
never
would
sorrow
for
her
parents
cease
to
abide
with
her
but
sorrow
can
not
be
the
sustenance
of
a
life
through
those
years
when
the
mind
is
strongest
and
the
sensations
most
vivid
had
she
by
her
done
aught
to
pleasure
those
dear
ones
who
slept
their
last
sleep
it
had
been
the
predominant
feature
of
her
morbid
passion
to
believe
that
piety
demanded
such
a
sacrifice
grief
may
reach
such
a
point
that
to
share
the
uttermost
fate
of
the
beloved
one
seems
blessedness
in
emily
mind
that
moment
of
supreme
agony
had
been
protracted
till
unreasoning
desire
took
to
itself
the
guise
of
duty
duty
so
represented
can
not
maintain
its
sanction
when
the
wounds
of
nature
grow
towards
healing
she
strove
with
herself
the
reaction
she
was
experiencing
seemed
to
her
a
shameful
weakness
must
she
cease
to
know
the
which
comes
of
conscious
perseverance
in
a
noble
effort
must
she
stand
an
ignoble
nature
incapable
of
anything
good
and
great
and
that
after
all
her
ambitions
was
she
a
mere
waif
at
the
mercy
of
the
currents
of
sense
never
before
had
she
felt
this
condemnation
of
her
own
spirit
she
had
suffered
beyond
utterance
but
ever
with
a
support
which
kept
her
from
the
last
despair
of
her
anguish
had
come
inspiration
now
she
felt
herself
abandoned
of
all
spiritual
good
she
came
to
loathe
her
life
as
a
polluted
stream
the
image
of
wilfrid
the
memory
of
her
lost
love
these
grew
to
be
symbols
of
her
baseness
it
was
too
much
to
face
those
with
whom
daily
duty
brought
her
in
contact
surely
they
must
read
in
her
face
the
degradation
of
which
she
was
conscious
as
much
as
possible
she
kept
apart
from
all
nursing
her
bitter
then
it
was
that
she
sought
relief
in
the
schemes
which
naturally
occur
to
a
woman
thus
miserable
she
would
relinquish
her
life
as
a
teacher
and
bury
her
wretchedness
beneath
physical
hardship
there
was
anguish
enough
in
the
world
and
she
would
go
to
live
in
the
midst
of
it
would
undertake
the
hardest
and
most
revolting
tasks
in
some
infirmary
thus
might
she
crush
out
of
herself
the
weakness
which
was
her
disgrace
it
remained
only
a
vision
that
which
was
terribly
real
the
waste
and
woe
of
her
heart
grew
ever
she
yielded
was
not
the
true
sin
this
that
she
tried
to
accomplish
the
slaying
of
the
love
which
cried
so
from
her
inmost
being
glimpses
of
the
old
faith
began
to
be
once
more
vouchsafed
her
at
moments
she
knew
the
joy
of
beautiful
things
this
was
in
living
in
the
great
seaport
she
could
easily
come
within
sight
of
the
blue
line
where
heaven
and
ocean
met
and
that
symbol
of
infinity
stirred
once
more
the
yearnings
for
boundless
joy
which
in
bygone
days
she
had
taught
herself
to
accept
as
her
creed
supposing
that
her
father
had
still
knowledge
of
the
life
she
led
would
it
make
him
happy
to
know
that
she
had
deprived
herself
of
every
pleasure
had
for
his
sake
ruined
a
future
which
might
have
been
so
fair
not
thus
do
we
show
piety
to
the
dead
rather
in
binding
our
brows
with
every
flower
our
hands
may
cull
and
in
drinking
sunlight
as
long
as
the
west
keeps
for
us
one
gleam
she
had
destroyed
herself
joy
could
arise
to
her
from
but
one
source
and
that
was
stopped
for
ever
for
it
never
came
to
emily
as
the
faintest
whisper
that
other
love
than
wilfrid
might
bless
her
life
that
was
constancy
which
nothing
could
shake
in
this
she
would
never
fall
from
the
ideal
she
had
set
before
herself
she
no
longer
tried
to
banish
thoughts
of
what
she
had
lost
wilfrid
was
a
companion
at
all
hours
far
more
real
than
the
people
with
whom
she
had
to
associate
she
had
alas
destroyed
his
letters
she
had
destroyed
the
book
in
which
she
wrote
the
secrets
of
her
heart
that
he
might
some
day
read
them
the
lack
of
a
single
thing
that
had
come
to
her
from
him
made
the
more
terribly
real
the
severance
of
his
life
from
hers
she
anguished
without
hope
then
there
came
to
her
the
knowledge
that
her
bodily
strength
was
threatened
by
disease
she
had
fainting
fits
and
in
the
comfort
administered
by
those
about
her
she
read
plainly
what
was
meant
to
be
concealed
at
times
this
was
a
relief
at
least
she
might
hope
to
be
spared
long
years
of
weary
desolation
and
death
come
when
he
might
would
be
a
friend
in
other
hours
the
all
but
certainty
of
her
doom
was
a
thought
so
terrible
that
reason
failed
before
it
was
there
no
hope
for
her
for
ever
nothing
but
the
grave
to
rest
her
tired
heart
why
had
fate
dealt
with
her
so
cruelly
she
looked
round
and
saw
none
upon
whom
had
fallen
a
curse
so
unrelieved
at
last
the
desire
to
go
once
more
to
the
south
of
england
grew
overpowering
if
she
could
live
in
london
she
felt
it
might
console
her
to
feel
that
she
was
near
wilfrid
he
would
not
seem
as
now
in
a
world
utterly
remote
perchance
she
might
one
day
even
see
him
if
she
had
knowledge
of
the
approach
of
death
wilfrid
would
not
refuse
to
come
and
see
her
at
the
last
and
with
her
hand
in
his
how
easy
it
would
be
to
die
she
sought
for
means
of
supporting
herself
in
london
she
still
had
money
saved
from
that
which
the
sale
of
her
father
house
had
brought
her
but
she
did
not
wish
to
use
more
of
this
than
she
could
help
keeping
it
for
a
certain
cherished
purpose
after
many
months
of
fruitless
endeavour
she
found
a
place
in
a
school
in
hammersmith
and
wilfrid
had
sat
by
her
had
looked
at
her
with
something
of
the
old
tenderness
had
pressed
her
hand
as
no
one
else
would
far
into
the
night
she
lay
thinking
over
every
word
he
had
spoken
sometimes
she
wept
poor
emily
he
had
not
asked
her
where
she
lived
for
that
doubtless
there
was
good
reason
but
it
was
much
to
have
seen
him
this
once
again
she
wept
saying
to
herself
that
she
loved
him
that
he
was
lost
to
her
that
she
must
die
chapter
xxiii
her
path
in
the
light
that
wilfrid
did
not
at
the
last
moment
leap
on
shore
and
follow
emily
seemed
to
him
less
the
result
of
than
obedience
to
outward
restraint
it
was
as
though
an
actual
hand
lay
on
his
shoulder
and
held
him
back
he
went
back
to
his
seat
and
again
fell
into
dreaminess
the
arrival
of
the
boat
at
chelsea
pier
reminded
him
that
he
must
land
thence
he
drove
home
on
reaching
the
house
he
found
birks
there
she
had
called
to
see
his
father
and
was
in
the
hall
on
the
point
of
leaving
as
he
entered
she
stepped
up
to
him
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
is
the
matter
with
beatrice
matter
how
seems
out
of
sorts
come
round
and
see
her
will
you
really
ca
just
now
wilfrid
replied
you
mean
that
she
is
not
well
seems
to
be
upsetting
her
why
ca
you
come
and
see
her
ca
this
evening
i
have
an
engagement
well
but
you
had
better
come
soon
i
think
do
understand
you
said
wilfrid
with
some
show
of
impatience
she
ill
exactly
ill
i
suppose
of
course
i
must
interfere
no
doubt
you
understand
will
come
as
soon
as
i
can
wilfrid
said
and
he
added
she
spoken
to
you
about
anything
wish
she
had
she
will
speak
neither
to
me
nor
to
anyone
else
it
is
too
bad
wilf
if
you
let
her
fret
herself
into
a
fever
she
is
just
the
girl
to
do
it
you
know
she
nodded
smiled
and
went
off
wilfrid
having
committed
himself
to
an
engagement
loitered
about
in
his
for
a
while
then
without
seeing
his
father
betook
himself
to
his
club
and
dined
there
after
passing
the
early
part
of
the
evening
in
an
uncomfortable
way
with
the
help
of
newspapers
and
casual
conversation
he
went
home
again
and
shut
himself
in
his
study
he
sat
long
without
attempting
to
do
anything
about
midnight
he
rose
as
if
to
leave
the
room
but
instead
of
doing
so
paced
the
floor
for
a
few
minutes
then
he
opened
a
certain
drawer
in
his
and
took
out
the
morocco
case
which
contained
emily
letters
he
slipped
off
the
band
the
letters
were
still
in
their
envelopes
and
lay
in
the
order
in
which
he
had
received
them
he
drew
forth
the
first
and
began
to
read
it
he
read
them
all
till
the
early
daybreak
he
remained
in
the
room
sometimes
walking
about
sometimes
seating
himself
to
this
letter
and
that
hours
ago
these
written
words
would
have
touched
his
heart
indeed
but
only
as
does
the
memory
of
an
irrecoverable
joy
he
could
have
read
them
and
still
have
gone
to
meet
beatrice
as
usual
or
with
but
a
little
more
than
his
ordinary
reserve
in
her
presence
it
was
otherwise
now
the
very
voice
had
spoken
again
and
its
tones
lingering
with
him
made
the
written
characters
vocal
each
word
uttered
itself
as
it
met
his
eye
emily
spoke
still
the
paper
was
old
the
ink
faded
but
the
love
was
of
this
hour
he
grew
fevered
and
it
was
the
fever
of
years
ago
which
had
only
been
in
appearance
subdued
it
had
lurked
still
in
his
blood
and
now
asserted
itself
with
the
old
dire
mastery
he
marvelled
that
he
had
suffered
her
to
leave
him
without
even
learning
where
she
lived
he
could
not
understand
what
his
mood
had
been
what
motives
had
weighed
with
him
he
had
not
been
conscious
of
a
severe
struggle
to
resist
a
temptation
the
temptation
had
not
in
fact
yet
formed
itself
what
was
her
own
thought
she
had
answered
his
questions
freely
perhaps
would
have
told
him
without
hesitation
the
address
of
her
lodgings
clearly
she
no
longer
sought
to
escape
him
but
that
he
reminded
himself
was
only
the
natural
response
to
his
own
perfectly
calm
way
of
speaking
she
could
not
suggest
embarrassments
when
it
was
his
own
cue
to
show
that
he
felt
none
she
was
still
free
it
seemed
but
what
was
her
feeling
towards
him
did
she
still
love
him
was
the
mysterious
cause
which
had
parted
them
still
valid
when
already
it
was
daylight
he
went
upstairs
and
lay
down
on
the
bed
he
was
weary
but
not
with
the
kind
of
weariness
that
brings
sleep
his
mind
was
occupied
with
plans
for
discovering
where
emily
lived
baxendale
had
professed
to
have
lost
sight
of
her
wilfrid
saw
now
that
there
was
a
reason
for
concealing
the
truth
and
felt
that
in
all
probability
his
friend
had
misled
him
in
any
case
he
could
not
apply
to
her
was
there
a
chance
of
a
second
meeting
in
the
same
place
emily
was
sure
to
be
free
on
saturday
afternoon
but
only
in
one
case
would
she
go
to
the
park
again
if
she
desired
to
see
him
and
imagined
a
corresponding
desire
on
his
side
and
that
was
an
unlikely
thing
granting
she
loved
him
it
was
not
in
emily
character
to
scheme
thus
under
the
circumstances
yet
why
had
she
chosen
to
come
and
live
in
london
beatrice
he
had
put
out
of
his
thoughts
he
did
not
do
it
deliberately
he
made
no
daring
plans
simply
he
gave
himself
over
to
the
rising
flood
of
passion
without
caring
to
ask
whither
it
would
bear
him
though
it
fevered
him
there
was
a
luxury
in
the
sense
of
abandonment
once
more
to
desire
which
suffered
no
questioning
that
he
had
ever
really
loved
beatrice
he
saw
now
to
be
more
than
doubtful
that
he
loved
emily
was
as
certain
as
that
he
lived
to
compare
the
images
of
the
two
women
was
to
set
side
by
side
a
life
sad
and
wan
with
one
which
bloomed
like
a
royal
flower
a
face
whose
lines
were
wasted
by
long
desolation
with
one
whose
loveliness
was
the
fit
embodiment
of
supreme
joy
but
in
the
former
he
found
a
beauty
of
which
the
other
offered
no
suggestion
a
beauty
which
appealed
to
him
with
the
most
subtle
allurements
which
drew
him
as
with
siren
song
which
if
he
still
contemplated
it
would
inspire
him
with
recklessness
he
made
no
effort
to
expel
it
from
his
imagination
every
hour
it
was
sweeter
to
forget
the
facts
of
life
and
dream
of
what
might
be
through
this
day
and
that
which
followed
he
kept
away
from
home
only
returning
late
at
night
no
more
news
of
beatrice
came
he
saw
that
his
father
regarded
him
with
looks
of
curiosity
but
only
conversation
of
the
wonted
kind
passed
between
them
when
saturday
arrived
he
was
no
longer
in
doubt
whether
to
pursue
the
one
faint
hope
of
finding
emily
again
in
bushey
park
the
difficulty
was
to
pass
the
time
till
noon
before
which
it
was
useless
to
start
he
was
due
for
the
last
sitting
in
the
studio
at
teddington
but
that
was
an
ordeal
impossible
to
go
through
in
his
present
state
of
mind
he
went
to
hampton
by
train
lunched
again
at
the
king
arms
though
but
hastily
and
at
length
reached
the
spot
in
the
park
where
his
eyes
had
discovered
emily
reading
it
was
not
such
a
day
as
wednesday
had
been
the
sun
shone
intermittently
but
there
was
threatening
of
rain
a
vehicle
now
and
then
drove
along
the
avenue
taking
to
the
palace
and
near
the
place
where
wilfrid
walked
a
party
was
picnicking
under
the
trees
but
he
in
vain
sought
for
one
who
wandered
alone
one
who
in
the
distance
could
move
him
to
uncertain
hope
why
had
he
come
suppose
he
did
again
meet
emily
what
had
he
to
say
to
her
long
and
useless
waiting
naturally
suggested
such
thoughts
and
the
answer
to
them
was
a
momentary
failing
at
the
heart
a
touch
of
fear
was
he
prepared
to
treat
this
temporary
coldness
between
beatrice
and
himself
as
a
final
rupture
was
his
present
behaviour
exactly
that
of
a
man
who
recognises
rules
of
honour
if
he
had
no
purpose
in
wishing
to
see
emily
but
the
satisfaction
of
a
desire
about
which
he
would
not
reason
was
it
not
unqualified
treachery
in
which
he
was
involving
himself
treachery
to
two
women
and
to
one
of
them
utter
cruelty
he
turned
to
walk
towards
the
lake
desperate
that
his
hope
had
failed
and
at
the
same
time
strange
contradiction
glad
in
the
thought
that
having
once
yielded
he
might
overcome
his
madness
he
passed
the
lake
and
reached
the
exit
from
the
park
at
the
same
moment
emily
was
entering
her
face
expressed
an
agony
of
shame
she
could
not
raise
her
eyes
could
not
speak
she
gave
him
her
hand
mechanically
and
walked
on
with
her
looks
averted
her
distress
was
so
unconcealed
that
it
pained
him
acutely
he
could
not
find
words
till
they
had
walked
a
distance
of
twenty
or
thirty
yards
then
he
said
came
purposely
in
the
hope
that
you
might
by
chance
be
here
do
i
annoy
you
she
half
turned
her
face
to
him
but
the
effort
to
speak
was
vain
a
still
longer
silence
followed
wilfrid
knew
at
length
what
he
had
done
that
utterance
of
his
had
but
one
meaning
emily
mute
reply
admitted
of
but
one
interpretation
his
eyes
dazzled
his
heart
beat
violently
a
gulf
sank
before
him
and
there
was
no
longer
choice
but
to
plunge
into
it
he
looked
at
his
companion
and
farewell
the
solid
ground
is
it
your
wish
that
i
should
leave
you
she
faced
him
moved
her
lips
motioned
with
her
head
she
was
like
one
who
is
led
to
death
i
will
not
leave
you
let
us
walk
gently
on
you
shall
speak
to
me
when
you
feel
able
he
cared
for
no
obstacle
now
she
was
come
back
to
him
from
the
dead
and
to
him
it
was
enough
of
life
to
hold
her
let
the
world
go
let
all
speak
of
him
as
they
would
this
pale
woman
should
henceforth
represent
existence
to
him
he
would
know
no
law
but
the
bidding
of
his
sovereign
love
she
spoke
i
fallen
in
your
eyes
have
always
been
to
me
the
highest
and
will
be
whilst
i
live
they
had
passed
into
the
shadow
of
the
trees
he
took
her
hand
and
held
it
the
touch
seemed
to
strengthen
her
for
she
looked
at
him
again
and
spoke
firmly
was
my
coming
without
thought
of
you
i
had
no
hope
that
you
would
be
here
no
least
hope
but
i
came
because
it
was
here
i
had
seen
you
wednesday
wilfrid
returned
have
read
your
letters
many
times
could
you
still
speak
to
me
as
you
did
then
you
could
believe
me
said
once
that
you
did
not
love
me
was
untrue
you
tell
me
now
what
it
was
that
came
between
us
she
fixed
upon
him
a
gaze
of
sad
entreaty
and
said
under
her
breath
now
i
will
never
ask
let
it
be
what
it
might
your
simple
word
that
you
loved
me
is
all
i
need
will
tell
you
emily
replied
i
can
not
now
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
that
that
secret
would
have
to
die
with
me
i
thought
so
till
i
met
you
here
then
i
knew
that
if
you
still
loved
me
and
had
been
faithful
to
me
so
long
i
could
say
nothing
to
myself
which
i
might
not
speak
to
you
my
love
for
you
has
conquered
every
other
love
and
everything
that
i
believed
my
duty
it
so
emily
he
asked
with
deepest
tenderness
i
tell
you
all
you
will
perhaps
feel
that
i
have
proved
my
own
weakness
i
will
conceal
from
you
nothing
i
have
ever
thought
you
will
see
that
i
tried
to
do
what
my
purest
instincts
urged
and
that
i
have
been
unable
to
persevere
to
the
end
wilfrid
own
soul
i
tell
you
all
that
happened
at
that
time
i
shall
indeed
speak
to
you
as
if
your
soul
and
mine
were
one
it
may
be
wrong
to
tell
you
you
may
despise
me
for
not
keeping
such
things
a
secret
for
ever
i
can
not
tell
whether
i
am
right
or
wrong
to
do
this
is
your
love
like
mine
would
say
it
was
greater
if
you
were
not
so
above
me
in
all
things
i
was
dying
in
my
loneliness
it
would
not
have
been
hard
to
die
for
if
i
was
weak
in
everything
else
at
least
my
love
for
you
would
have
grown
to
my
last
breath
if
i
speak
things
which
i
should
only
prove
in
silence
it
is
that
you
may
not
afterwards
judge
me
hardly
shall
tell
me
wilfrid
replied
you
are
my
wife
till
then
i
will
hear
nothing
but
that
you
are
and
always
have
been
mine
they
came
to
a
great
tree
about
the
trunk
of
which
had
been
built
a
circular
seat
the
glades
on
every
side
showed
no
disturbing
approach
us
sit
here
said
wilfrid
have
always
talked
with
each
other
in
the
open
air
have
we
he
drew
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
face
passionately
it
was
the
satisfying
of
a
hunger
of
years
with
beatrice
his
caresses
had
seldom
been
other
than
playful
from
the
first
moment
of
with
emily
he
had
longed
to
hold
her
to
his
heart
i
hope
to
keep
you
now
you
wo
leave
me
again
emily
i
leave
you
wilfrid
it
will
be
to
die
again
he
folded
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
lips
her
cheeks
her
eyes
she
was
as
weak
as
a
trembling
flower
i
shall
be
in
dread
through
every
moment
that
parts
us
will
you
consent
to
whatever
i
ask
of
you
once
before
i
would
have
taken
you
and
made
you
my
wife
and
if
you
had
yielded
we
should
have
escaped
all
this
long
misery
will
you
now
do
what
i
wish
she
looked
at
him
questioningly
you
marry
me
as
soon
as
it
can
possibly
be
on
monday
i
will
do
what
is
necessary
and
we
can
be
married
on
wednesday
this
time
you
will
not
refuse
one
day
only
need
intervene
between
the
notice
and
the
marriage
it
shall
be
at
the
church
nearest
to
you
why
do
you
fear
had
taken
hold
upon
her
she
could
not
face
the
thought
wilfrid
checked
her
faint
words
with
his
lips
wish
it
he
said
himself
shaken
with
a
tempest
of
passion
which
whelmed
the
last
protest
of
his
conscience
shall
scarcely
tear
myself
from
you
even
till
then
emily
emily
what
has
my
life
been
without
your
love
oh
you
will
be
the
angel
that
raises
me
out
of
the
ignoble
world
into
which
i
have
fallen
hold
me
to
you
make
me
feel
and
believe
that
you
have
saved
me
emily
my
beautiful
my
goddess
let
me
worship
you
pray
to
you
mine
now
mine
love
for
ever
and
ever
she
burst
into
tears
unable
to
suffer
this
new
denizen
of
her
heart
the
sure
and
certain
hope
of
bliss
he
kissed
away
the
tears
as
they
fell
whispering
love
that
was
near
to
frenzy
there
came
a
bob
that
shook
her
whole
frame
then
wilfrid
felt
her
cheek
grow
very
cold
against
his
her
eyes
were
half
closed
from
her
lips
escaped
a
faint
moan
he
drew
back
and
uncertain
whether
she
had
lost
consciousness
called
to
her
to
speak
her
body
could
not
fall
for
it
rested
against
a
hollow
part
of
the
great
trunk
the
faintness
lasted
only
for
a
few
moments
she
once
more
gazed
at
him
with
the
eyes
of
infinite
sadness
is
so
hard
to
bear
happiness
were
her
first
words
dearest
you
are
weak
and
worn
with
trouble
oh
we
will
soon
leave
that
far
behind
us
are
you
better
my
lily
only
give
me
your
hands
to
hold
and
i
will
be
very
still
your
hands
are
so
light
they
weigh
no
more
than
leaves
do
you
suffer
dear
little
pain
there
she
touched
her
heart
wilfrid
looked
into
her
face
anxiously
you
often
that
pain
not
often
i
do
feel
it
now
wilfrid
every
day
i
have
spoken
that
name
have
spoken
it
aloud
have
i
often
spoken
yours
dear
they
gazed
at
each
other
in
silence
it
is
to
be
as
i
wish
wilfrid
said
gently
very
soon
very
long
this
is
only
saturday
if
i
had
known
this
morning
it
could
have
been
on
monday
wife
wilfrid
really
your
wife
your
voice
has
changed
till
now
you
spoke
so
sadly
those
words
are
like
the
happiest
of
our
old
happy
time
three
long
days
to
be
passed
but
not
one
day
more
you
promise
me
do
your
bidding
now
and
always
always
for
the
moment
she
had
forgotten
everything
but
love
and
love
rapture
it
was
as
though
life
spread
before
her
in
limitless
glory
she
thought
nothing
of
the
dark
foe
with
whose
presence
she
had
become
so
familiar
they
talked
long
only
the
lengthening
and
deepening
shadow
of
the
trees
reminded
them
at
length
that
hours
had
passed
whilst
they
sat
here
boat
will
have
gone
emily
said
mind
we
will
get
a
conveyance
at
the
hotel
and
you
must
have
refreshment
of
some
kind
shall
we
see
what
they
can
give
us
to
eat
at
the
king
arms
to
be
sure
we
will
it
will
be
our
first
meal
together
they
rose
wilfrid
can
trust
you
you
will
not
fail
me
if
i
am
living
wilfrid
but
i
shall
of
course
see
you
before
wednesday
is
sunday
he
checked
himself
sunday
was
the
day
he
always
gave
to
beatrice
but
he
durst
not
think
of
that
now
sunday
there
are
so
many
people
about
he
continued

on
monday
afternoon
emily
promised
to
do
so

write
to
you
and
again
a
letter

lodgings

my
my
husband
wife
they
walked
to
the
hotel
and
thence
when
dusk
was
falling
started
to
drive
homewards
they
stopped
at
the
end
of
emily
street
and
wilfrid
walked
with
her
to
the
door
monday
afternoon
he
said
grasping
her
hand
as
if
he
clung
to
it
in
fear
then
he
found
another
vehicle
it
was
dark
when
he
reached
home
chapter
xxiv
the
unexpected
late
in
the
evening
wilfrid
received
a
visit
from
his
father
athel
had
dined
with
his
sister
and
subsequently
accompanied
his
nieces
to
a
concert
beatrice
should
have
sung
but
had
broken
her
engagement
on
the
plea
of
at
home
all
the
evening
athel
began
by
asking
got
home
late
wilfrid
answered
rising
from
his
chair
his
father
had
something
to
say
which
cost
him
hesitation
he
walked
about
with
his
hands
between
the
tails
of
his
coat
beatrice
lately
he
inquired
at
length
not
since
last
monday
afraid
she
is
well
she
did
sing
did
dine
with
us
either
wilfrid
kept
silence
wrong
was
his
father
next
question
there
is
sorry
to
hear
that
wilfrid
went
to
the
fireplace
and
leaned
his
arm
upon
the
mantelpiece
as
he
did
not
seem
disposed
to
speak
his
father
continued
serious
i
hope
something
serious
do
mean
that
anything
you
can
talk
about
afraid
not
i
shall
go
and
see
beatrice
as
usual
tomorrow
i
may
be
at
liberty
to
tell
you
after
that
though
probably
not
for
a
few
days
athel
looked
annoyed
hope
this
is
not
of
your
doing
he
said
tell
me
the
girl
is
causing
them
a
good
deal
of
anxiety
for
the
last
few
days
she
has
been
sitting
alone
scarcely
touching
food
and
refusing
to
speak
to
anyone
if
this
goes
on
she
will
be
wilfrid
spoke
hoarsely
ca
help
it
i
shall
see
her
right
observed
his
father
with
the
impatience
which
was
his
way
of
meeting
disorders
in
this
admirable
universe
aunt
asked
me
to
tell
you
this
of
course
i
can
do
no
more
wilfrid
made
no
reply
and
athel
left
him
it
was
an
hour
of
terrible
suffering
that
wilfrid
lived
through
before
he
left
the
study
and
went
to
lay
his
head
on
the
pillow
he
had
not
thought
very
much
of
beatrice
hitherto
the
passion
which
had
spurred
him
blindly
on
made
him
forgetful
of
everything
but
the
end
his
heart
desired
now
that
the
end
was
within
reach
he
could
consider
what
it
was
that
he
had
done
he
was
acting
like
a
very
madman
he
could
not
hope
that
any
soul
would
regard
his
frenzy
even
with
compassion
on
all
sides
he
would
meet
with
the
sternest
condemnation
who
would
recognise
his
wife
this
step
which
he
was
taking
meant
rupture
with
all
his
relatives
perchance
with
all
his
friends
for
it
would
be
universally
declared
that
he
had
been
guilty
of
utter
baseness
his
career
was
ruined
it
might
happen
that
he
would
have
to
leave
england
with
emily
abandoning
for
her
sake
everything
else
that
he
prized
how
would
beatrice
bear
the
revelation
mere
suspense
had
made
her
ill
such
a
blow
as
this
might
kill
her
never
before
had
he
been
consciously
guilty
of
an
act
of
cruelty
or
of
wrong
to
any
the
least
valued
of
those
with
whom
he
had
dealt
to
realise
what
his
treachery
meant
to
beatrice
was
so
terrible
that
he
dared
not
fix
his
thought
upon
it
her
love
for
him
was
intense
beyond
anything
he
had
imagined
in
woman
emily
had
never
seemed
to
him
possessed
with
so
vehement
a
passion
indeed
he
had
often
doubted
whether
emily
was
a
passionate
nature
at
times
she
was
almost
cold
appeared
so
in
his
thought
of
her
and
never
had
she
given
way
to
that
ardour
which
was
so
common
in
beatrice
sweat
broke
out
upon
his
forehead
as
he
saw
the
tragic
issues
to
which
his
life
was
tending
there
was
no
retreat
save
by
a
second
act
of
apostasy
so
unspeakably
shameful
that
the
brand
of
it
would
drive
him
to
he
had
made
his
choice
or
had
been
driven
upon
it
by
the
powers
which
ruled
his
destiny
it
only
remained
to
have
the
courage
of
his
resolve
and
to
defy
consequences
at
least
it
was
in
no
less
a
cause
than
that
of
his
life
one
love
there
was
no
stamp
of
turpitude
on
the
end
for
which
he
would
sacrifice
so
much
and
occasion
so
much
misery
he
passed
the
time
in
his
own
rooms
till
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
then
at
the
customary
hour
he
set
forth
to
visit
beatrice
would
she
see
him
in
his
heart
he
hoped
that
she
would
refuse
to
yet
he
dreaded
lest
he
should
be
told
that
she
was
too
unwell
it
was
a
new
thing
in
wilfrid
experience
to
approach
any
door
with
shame
and
dread
between
his
ringing
the
bell
and
the
servant
answer
he
learnt
what
those
words
mean
he
was
admitted
as
usual
the
servant
making
no
remark
as
usual
he
was
led
to
beatrice
room
she
was
sitting
in
the
chair
she
always
occupied
and
was
dressed
with
the
accustomed
perfection
but
her
face
was
an
index
to
the
sufferings
she
had
endured
this
past
week
as
soon
as
the
door
had
closed
she
stood
to
receive
him
but
not
with
extended
hand
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
steadily
and
wilfrid
with
difficulty
meeting
them
experienced
a
shook
of
new
fear
a
kind
of
fear
he
could
not
account
for
outwardly
she
was
quite
calm
it
was
something
in
her
look
an
indefinable
suggestion
of
secret
anguish
that
impressed
him
so
he
did
not
try
to
take
her
hand
but
having
laid
down
his
hat
came
near
to
her
and
spoke
as
quietly
as
he
could
i
speak
to
you
of
what
passed
between
us
last
monday
can
we
avoid
speaking
of
it
she
replied
in
a
low
voice
her
eyes
still
searching
him
ought
to
have
come
to
see
you
before
this
wilfrid
continued
taking
the
seat
to
which
she
pointed
whilst
she
also
sat
down
could
not
have
been
expecting
you
beatrice
said
in
an
emotionless
way
the
nervous
tension
with
which
he
had
come
into
her
presence
had
yielded
to
a
fit
of
trembling
coldness
ran
along
his
veins
his
tongue
refused
its
office
his
eyes
sank
before
her
gaze
felt
sure
you
would
come
beatrice
continued
with
the
same
absence
of
pronounced
feeling
not
i
must
have
gone
to
your
house
what
do
you
wish
to
say
to
me
which
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
say
i
feel
that
after
what
happened
on
monday
we
can
not
be
quite
the
same
to
each
other
i
fear
i
said
some
things
that
were
not
wholly
true
beatrice
seemed
to
be
holding
her
breath
her
face
was
marble
she
sat
unmoving
mean
she
said
at
length
those
letters
represented
more
than
you
were
willing
to
confess
it
was
calmly
asked
evidently
wilfrid
had
no
outbreak
of
resentment
to
fear
he
would
have
preferred
it
to
this
dreadful
he
answered
i
felt
at
the
time
i
spoke
no
word
of
conscious
falsehood
anything
happened
to
prove
to
you
what
you
then
denied
he
looked
at
her
in
doubt
could
she
in
any
way
have
learnt
what
had
come
to
pass
whilst
talking
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
disclose
nothing
definitely
he
would
explain
his
behaviour
merely
as
arising
from
doubt
of
himself
it
would
make
the
rest
easier
for
her
to
bear
hereafter
have
read
those
letters
again
he
answered
you
have
learnt
that
you
never
loved
me
he
held
his
eyes
down
unable
to
utter
words
beatrice
also
was
silent
for
a
long
time
at
length
she
said
think
you
are
keeping
something
from
me
he
raised
his
face
nothing
else
happened
she
asked
with
measured
tone
a
little
sad
nothing
more
the
truth
was
forced
from
him
and
its
utterance
gave
him
a
relief
which
was
in
itself
a
source
of
new
agitation
something
else
has
happened
knew
it
did
you
felt
it
you
have
met
her
again
again
he
was
speechless
beatrice
asked
she
live
in
london
does
have
met
her
and
have
have
wished
that
you
were
free
i
have
done
worse
i
have
acted
as
though
i
were
free
she
shook
as
if
a
blow
had
fallen
upon
her
then
a
smile
came
to
her
lips
have
asked
her
again
to
be
your
wife
have
she
has
consented
i
deceived
her
at
the
same
time
that
i
behaved
dishonourably
to
you
she
fixed
upon
him
eyes
which
had
a
strange
inward
look
eyes
veiled
with
reverie
vaguely
troubled
unimpassioned
it
was
as
though
she
calmly
readjusted
in
her
own
mind
the
relations
between
him
and
herself
the
misery
of
wilfrid
situation
was
mitigated
in
a
degree
by
mere
wonder
at
her
mode
of
receiving
his
admissions
this
interview
was
no
logical
sequence
upon
the
scene
of
a
week
ago
and
the
issue
then
had
been
one
would
have
thought
less
provocative
of
demonstration
than
directness
once
more
armed
her
gaze
and
again
he
was
powerless
to
meet
it
still
no
resentment
no
condemnation
she
asked
is
your
intention
to
marry
soon
he
could
not
reply
you
let
me
see
you
once
more
before
your
marriage
she
continued
is
if
i
find
i
wish
it
i
am
not
sure
i
may
or
may
not
it
was
rather
a
debate
with
herself
than
an
address
to
him
i
leave
you
now
beatrice
he
said
suddenly
drop
of
blood
in
me
is
in
telling
you
this
i
have
done
something
which
i
thought
would
be
beyond
my
force
she
murmured
will
be
better
if
we
part
now
she
rose
and
watched
him
as
he
stepped
to
the
table
and
took
his
hat
there
was
a
moment
hesitation
on
either
side
but
beatrice
did
not
offer
her
hand
she
stood
superbly
as
a
queen
might
dismiss
one
from
whom
her
thoughts
were
already
wandering
he
bowed
with
inward
and
left
her
some
hours
later
when
already
the
summer
evening
had
cloaked
itself
wilfrid
found
himself
wandering
by
the
river
not
far
from
hammersmith
the
influence
of
a
great
water
flowing
from
darkness
into
darkness
was
strong
upon
him
he
was
seeking
for
a
hope
in
the
transitoriness
of
all
things
earthly
would
not
the
hour
come
when
this
present
anguish
this
shame
would
have
passed
far
away
and
have
left
no
mark
was
it
not
thinking
too
grandiosely
to
attribute
to
the
actions
of
such
a
one
as
himself
a
tragic
gravity
was
there
not
supernal
laughter
at
the
sight
of
him
wilfrid
athel
an
english
gentleman
a
member
of
the
lower
house
of
the
british
parliament
posing
as
the
arbiter
of
destinies
what
did
it
all
come
to
an
imbroglio
on
the
threshold
of
matrimony
a
temporary
doubt
which
of
two
women
was
to
enjoy
the
honour
of
styling
herself
athel
the
day
long
shame
led
to
this
completeness
of
as
if
beatrice
would
greatly
care
why
in
his
very
behaviour
he
had
offered
the
cure
for
her
heartburn
and
her
calmness
showed
how
effective
the
remedy
would
be
the
very
wife
whom
he
held
securely
had
only
been
won
by
keeping
silence
tell
her
the
story
of
the
last
few
days
and
behold
him
altogether
wifeless
he
laughed
scornfully
to
this
had
he
come
from
those
dreams
which
guided
him
when
he
was
a
youth
a
commonplace
man
why
should
he
not
have
commonplace
experiences
he
had
walked
in
this
direction
with
the
thought
of
passing
beneath
emily
window
before
he
returned
home
yet
now
that
he
was
not
more
than
half
an
hour
walk
from
her
he
felt
weary
and
looked
aside
for
a
street
which
should
lead
him
to
the
region
of
vehicles
as
he
did
so
he
noticed
a
woman
form
leaning
over
the
riverside
parapet
at
a
short
distance
a
thought
drew
him
nearer
to
her
yes
it
was
emily
herself
were
coming
to
see
me
she
asked
love
in
a
woman
voice
what
cynicism
so
perdurable
that
it
will
bear
against
that
assailant
in
the
dusk
he
put
her
gloved
hand
against
his
lips
and
the
touch
made
him
once
more
noble
had
meant
to
beautiful
but
it
seemed
too
late
and
i
was
just
on
the
point
of
turning
back
you
always
appear
to
me
when
i
most
need
you
wanted
to
speak
to
me
wilfrid
do
i
not
my
life
seems
so
thin
and
poor
only
your
breath
gives
it
colour
emily
i
shall
ask
so
much
of
you
i
have
lost
all
faith
in
myself
you
must
restore
it
they
stood
close
to
each
other
hand
in
hand
looking
down
at
the
dark
flow
i
had
not
met
you
wilfrid
she
said
or
whispered
think
my
end
must
have
been
there
there
below
us
i
have
often
come
here
at
night
it
is
always
a
lonely
place
and
at
high
tide
the
water
is
deep
his
hand
closed
upon
hers
with
rescuing
force
am
carrying
a
letter
emily
continued
i
was
going
to
post
before
i
went
in
i
will
give
it
you
now
and
i
am
glad
of
the
opportunity
it
seems
safer
i
have
written
what
i
feel
i
could
never
say
to
you
read
it
and
destroy
it
and
never
speak
of
what
it
contains
she
gave
him
the
letter
and
then
he
walked
with
her
homewards
on
the
morrow
shortly
after
breakfast
he
was
sitting
in
his
study
when
a
knock
came
at
the
door
he
bade
enter
and
it
was
beatrice
she
came
towards
him
gave
her
hand
mechanically
and
said
you
spare
me
a
few
minutes
he
placed
a
chair
for
her
her
eyes
had
not
closed
since
they
last
looked
at
him
he
saw
it
though
the
expression
of
her
features
was
not
weariness
is
one
thing
wilfrid
that
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
ask
you
will
you
tell
me
why
she
left
you
years
ago
her
tone
was
that
of
one
continuing
a
conversation
there
might
have
been
no
break
between
yesterday
and
we
can
not
always
gather
from
the
voice
what
struggle
has
preceded
utterance
wilfrid
turned
away
on
the
table
lay
that
letter
of
emily
he
had
read
it
many
times
and
was
reading
it
when
the
knock
disturbed
him
with
a
sudden
movement
he
took
up
the
sheet
of
paper
and
held
it
to
beatrice
is
there
the
reason
i
myself
have
only
known
it
a
few
hours
read
that
i
have
no
right
to
show
it
you
and
no
right
to
refuse
beatrice
held
the
letter
for
a
brief
space
without
turning
her
eyes
upon
it
wilfrid
walked
to
a
distance
and
at
length
she
read
emily
had
recounted
every
circumstance
of
her
father
death
and
told
the
history
of
her
own
feelings
all
with
complete
simplicity
almost
coldly
only
an
uncertainty
in
the
here
and
there
showed
the
suffering
it
had
cost
her
to
look
once
more
into
the
very
eyes
of
the
past
yet
it
was
of
another
than
herself
that
she
wrote
she
felt
that
even
in
her
memory
of
woe
they
faced
each
other
again
beatrice
eyes
were
distended
their
depths
lightened
am
glad
i
am
glad
you
met
her
before
it
was
too
late
her
voice
quivered
upon
a
low
rich
note
such
an
utterance
was
the
outcome
of
a
nature
strong
to
the
last
limit
of
wilfrid
heard
and
regarded
her
with
a
kind
of
fear
her
intensity
passed
to
him
he
trembled
have
nothing
to
pardon
she
continued
were
hers
long
before
my
love
had
touched
your
heart
you
have
tried
to
love
me
but
this
has
come
soon
enough
to
save
us
both
and
again
i
did
not
love
you
i
should
act
selfishly
but
self
is
all
gone
from
me
in
this
moment
i
could
do
greater
things
to
help
you
to
happiness
tell
me
have
you
yet
spoken
to
to
the
others
no
one
do
not
it
shall
all
come
from
me
no
one
shall
cast
upon
you
a
shadow
of
blame
you
have
done
me
no
wrong
you
were
hers
and
you
wronged
her
when
you
tried
to
love
me
i
will
help
you
at
least
i
can
be
your
friend
listen
i
shall
see
her
it
shall
be
i
who
have
brought
you
together
again
that
is
how
the
shall
all
think
of
it
i
shall
see
her
and
as
your
friend
as
the
only
one
to
whom
you
have
yet
spoken
do
you
understand
me
wilfrid
do
you
see
that
i
make
the
future
smooth
for
her
and
you
she
must
never
know
what
know
and
the
others
they
shall
do
as
i
will
they
shall
not
dare
to
speak
one
word
against
you
what
right
have
they
if
am
am
glad
he
stood
in
amaze
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
her
sincerity
her
face
the
music
of
her
voice
the
gestures
by
which
her
eagerness
expressed
herself
all
were
too
truthful
what
divine
nature
had
lain
hidden
in
this
woman
he
gazed
at
her
as
on
a
being
more
than
mortal
can
i
accept
this
from
you
he
asked
hoarsely
how
can
you
refuse
it
is
my
right
it
is
my
will
would
you
refuse
me
this
one
poor
chance
of
proving
that
my
love
was
unselfish
i
would
have
killed
myself
to
win
a
tender
look
from
you
at
the
last
moment
and
you
shall
not
go
away
thinking
less
of
me
than
i
deserve
you
know
already
that
i
am
not
the
idle
powerless
woman
you
once
thought
me
you
shall
know
that
i
can
do
yet
more
if
is
noble
in
your
eyes
can
consent
to
be
less
so
passion
the
most
exalted
possessed
her
it
infected
wilfrid
he
felt
that
the
common
laws
of
intercourse
between
man
and
woman
had
here
no
application
the
higher
ground
to
which
she
summoned
him
knew
no
authority
of
the
conventional
to
hang
his
head
was
to
proclaim
his
own
littleness
are
not
less
noble
beatrice
his
voice
murmured
have
said
it
so
there
is
no
longer
a
constraint
between
us
how
simple
it
is
to
do
for
love
sake
what
those
who
do
not
know
love
think
impossible
i
will
see
her
then
the
last
difficulty
is
removed
that
letter
has
told
me
where
she
lives
if
i
go
there
i
shall
find
her
till
the
evening
wilfrid
replied
under
his
breath
is
your
marriage
he
looked
at
her
without
speaking
soon
before
the
end
of
the
session
day
after
she
was
white
to
the
lips
but
kept
her
eyes
on
him
steadily
you
go
away
at
once
had
thought
he
began
then
added
at
once
it
is
better
better
your
friend
stays
and
makes
all
ready
for
your
return
perhaps
i
shall
not
see
you
after
for
that
time
then
we
are
to
each
ether
what
we
used
to
be
you
will
bring
her
to
hear
me
sing
i
shall
not
give
it
up
now
she
smiled
moved
a
little
away
from
him
then
turned
again
and
gave
her
hand
for
would
not
grudge
it
me
kiss
me
the
last
time
on
my
lips
he
kissed
her
when
the
light
came
again
to
his
eyes
beatrice
had
gone
in
the
evening
emily
sat
expectant
either
wilfrid
would
come
or
there
would
be
a
letter
from
him
yes
he
would
come
for
after
reading
what
she
had
written
the
desire
to
speak
with
her
must
be
strong
in
him
she
sat
at
her
window
and
looked
along
the
dull
street
she
had
spent
the
day
as
usual
that
is
to
say
in
the
familiar
school
routine
but
the
heart
she
had
brought
to
her
work
was
far
other
than
that
which
for
long
years
had
laboriously
pulsed
the
flagging
moments
of
her
life
her
pupils
were
no
longer
featureless
beings
the
sole
end
of
whose
existence
was
to
give
trouble
and
budding
womanhood
had
circled
about
her
the
lips
which
recited
lessons
made
unconscious
music
the
eyes
dark
or
sunny
laughed
with
secret
foresight
of
love
to
come
kindly
affection
to
one
and
all
grew
warm
within
her
what
had
been
only
languid
preferences
developed
in
an
hour
to
little
less
than
attachments
and
dislikes
softened
to
pity
the
girls
who
gave
promise
of
beauty
and
tenderness
she
looked
upon
with
the
eyes
of
a
sister
their
lot
it
would
be
to
know
the
ecstasy
of
whispered
vows
to
give
and
to
receive
that
happiness
which
is
not
to
be
named
lest
the
gods
become
envious
voices
singing
together
in
the
class
practice
which
had
ever
been
a
weariness
stirred
her
to
a
passion
of
delight
it
was
the
choral
symphony
of
love
handmaidens
did
they
see
a
change
in
her
emily
fancied
that
the
elder
girls
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
and
exchanged
words
in
an
undertone
about
her
it
was
well
to
have
told
wilfrid
all
her
secrets
yet
in
the
impatience
of
waiting
she
had
tremors
of
misgiving
would
he
perchance
think
as
she
so
long
had
thought
that
to
speak
to
anyone
however
near
of
that
bygone
woe
and
shame
was
a
sin
against
the
pieties
of
nature
least
of
all
excusable
when
committed
at
the
bidding
of
her
own
desires
he
would
never
breathe
to
her
a
word
which
could
reveal
such
a
thought
but
wilfrid
with
his
susceptibility
to
the
beautiful
in
character
his
nature
so
intensely
in
sympathy
with
her
own
might
more
or
less
consciously
judge
her
to
have
fallen
from
fidelity
to
the
high
ideal
could
he
have
learnt
the
story
of
her
life
she
still
persevering
on
her
widowed
way
would
he
not
have
deemed
her
nobler
aid
against
this
subtlety
of
conscience
rose
in
the
form
of
administered
by
that
joyous
voice
of
nature
which
no
longer
timidly
begged
a
hearing
but
came
as
a
mandate
from
an
unveiled
sovereign
with
what
right
pray
did
she
desire
to
show
in
wilfrid
eyes
as
other
than
she
was
that
part
in
life
alone
becomes
us
which
is
the
very
expression
of
ourselves
what
merit
can
there
be
in
playing
the
votary
of
an
ascetic
conviction
when
the
heart
is
bursting
with
its
stifled
cry
for
light
and
warmth
for
human
joy
for
the
golden
fruit
of
the
tree
of
life
she
had
been
sincere
in
her
renunciation
the
way
of
worthiness
was
to
cherish
a
sincerity
as
complete
now
that
her
soul
flamed
to
the
bliss
which
fate
once
more
offered
her
the
hours
passed
slowly
how
long
the
night
would
be
if
wilfrid
neither
wrote
to
her
nor
came
but
he
had
written
at
eight
the
glad
signal
of
the
postman
drew
her
to
the
door
of
her
room
where
she
stood
trembling
whilst
someone
went
to
the
and
oh
joy
ascended
the
stairs
it
was
her
letter
because
her
hands
were
too
unsteady
to
hold
it
for
reading
she
knelt
by
a
chair
like
a
child
with
a
new
and
spread
the
sheet
open
and
having
read
it
twice
she
let
her
face
fall
upon
her
palms
to
repeat
to
herself
the
words
which
danced
b
re
her
darkened
eyes
he
wrote
rather
sadly
but
she
would
not
have
had
it
otherwise
for
the
sadness
was
of
love
innermost
heart
which
is
the
shrine
of
mortality
as
emily
knelt
thus
by
the
chair
there
came
another
knock
at
the
the
knock
of
a
visitor
she
did
not
hear
it
nor
yet
the
tap
at
her
own
door
which
followed
she
was
startled
to
consciousness
by
her
landlady
voice
a
lady
wishes
to
see
you
miss
hood
lady
emily
repeated
in
surprise
then
it
occurred
to
her
that
it
must
be
baxendale
who
knew
her
address
and
was
likely
to
be
in
london
at
this
time
of
the
year
she
give
any
name
no
name
emily
requested
that
the
visitor
should
be
introduced
not
baxendale
but
a
face
at
first
barely
remembered
then
growing
with
suggestiveness
upon
emily
gaze
until
all
was
known
save
the
name
attached
to
it
a
face
which
at
present
seemed
to
bear
the
pale
signs
of
suffering
though
it
smiled
a
beautiful
visage
of
high
meanings
impressive
beneath
its
crown
of
dark
hair
it
smiled
and
still
smiled
the
eyes
looked
searchingly
do
not
remember
me
miss
hood
i
remember
you
your
face
your
voice
but
your
name
you
are
baxendale
niece
miss
redwing
how
could
i
forget
emily
became
silent
the
eyes
that
searched
her
so
were
surely
kind
but
it
was
the
time
of
fears
impossible
that
so
strange
a
visit
should
be
unconnected
with
her
fate
and
the
voice
thrilled
upon
her
strung
nerves
ominously
the
lips
she
watched
were
so
eloquent
of
repressed
feeling
why
should
this
lady
come
to
her
their
acquaintance
had
been
so
very
slight
she
murmured
an
invitation
to
be
seated
a
moment
returned
beatrice
must
wonder
to
see
me
but
i
think
you
remember
that
i
was
a
friend
of
the
athels
i
am
come
with
athel
leave
mr
wilfrid
emily
was
agitated
and
could
not
smooth
her
features
do
think
i
bring
you
bad
news
pursued
the
other
quickly
leaning
a
little
forward
and
again
raising
her
eyes
she
had
dropped
them
on
the
mention
of
wilfrid
name
have
come
in
fact
to
put
athel
at
ease
in
his
mind
she
laughed
nervously
and
i
have
been
close
friends
for
a
very
long
time
indeed
since
we
were
all
but
children
and
i
he
you
wo
misunderstand
he
has
told
me
me
alone
as
yet
of
what
has
happened
of
the
great
good
fortune
that
has
come
to
him
so
unexpectedly
if
you
knew
the
terms
of
our
friendship
you
would
understand
how
natural
it
was
for
him
to
take
me
into
his
confidence
miss
hood
and
i
begged
him
to
let
me
visit
you
because
again
she
laughed
in
the
same
nervous
way
he
was
in
a
foolish
anxiety
lest
you
might
have
vanished
i
told
him
it
was
best
that
he
should
have
the
evidence
of
a
very
practical
person
senses
that
you
were
really
here
and
that
he
had
only
dreamt
it
and
as
we
did
know
each
other
you
see
you
will
construe
my
behaviour
kindly
will
you
not
i
will
miss
redwing
emily
responded
warmly
else
could
i
meet
your
own
great
kindness
feared
so
many
things
even
at
the
door
i
almost
turned
away
there
seemed
so
little
excuse
for
my
visit
it
was
like
intruding
upon
you
but
athel
assured
me
that
i
should
not
be
unwelcome
emily
overcome
by
the
sense
of
relief
after
her
apprehensions
gave
free
utterance
to
the
warm
words
in
which
her
joy
voiced
itself
she
forgot
all
that
was
strange
in
beatrice
manner
or
attributed
it
merely
to
timidity
sympathy
just
now
was
like
sunshine
to
her
she
could
not
inquire
whence
or
why
it
came
but
was
content
to
let
it
bathe
her
in
its
divine
solace
you
knew
how
it
has
flattered
me
beatrice
continued
with
a
semblance
of
goodness
which
her
hearer
had
no
thought
of
criticising
is
the
final
proof
of
athel
good
opinion
you
know
his
poor
opinion
of
conventional
people
and
conventional
behaviour
he
is
determined
that
no
one
shall
be
told
till
till
after
wednesday
making
me
the
sole
exception
you
see
but
seriously
i
am
glad
he
did
so
and
that
i
have
been
able
to
meet
you
again
just
at
this
time
now
i
can
assure
him
that
you
are
indeed
a
living
being
and
that
there
is
no
danger
whatever
of
your
disappearing
emily
did
not
join
the
musical
laugh
but
her
heart
was
full
and
she
just
laid
her
hand
on
that
of
beatrice
was
only
for
a
moment
the
latter
said
rising
as
she
felt
the
touch
is
no
hour
for
paying
visits
and
indeed
i
have
to
hurry
back
again
i
should
like
to
only
to
say
that
you
have
my
very
kindest
wishes
you
forgive
my
coming
you
forgive
my
hastening
away
so
feel
i
ought
to
thank
you
more
broke
from
emily
lips
me
believe
it
is
all
very
like
a
dream
o
it
was
kind
of
you
to
come
you
ca
think
she
added
with
only
apparent
irrelevance
often
i
have
recalled
your
beautiful
singing
i
have
always
thought
of
you
with
gratitude
for
that
deep
pleasure
you
gave
me
you
shall
hear
me
sing
again
laughed
beatrice
athel
to
tell
you
something
about
that
indeed
it
must
be
they
took
each
other
hands
but
for
emily
it
was
not
sufficient
she
stepped
nearer
offering
her
lips
beatrice
kissed
her
chapter
xxv
a
family
conclave
at
eleven
on
wednesday
morning
beatrice
called
at
the
house
receiving
the
expected
information
that
wilfrid
was
not
at
home
she
requested
that
athel
senior
might
not
be
disturbed
and
went
to
wilfrid
study
alone
in
the
room
she
took
from
her
a
little
packet
addressed
to
wilfrid
on
which
she
had
written
the
word
and
laid
it
on
the
she
appeared
to
have
given
special
attention
to
her
toilet
this
morning
her
attire
was
that
of
a
lady
of
fashion
rich
elaborate
devised
with
consummate
art
its
luxury
draping
well
the
superb
form
wherein
blended
with
such
strange
ardour
the
flames
of
heroism
and
voluptuousness
her
moving
made
the
air
delicate
with
faint
perfume
her
attitude
as
she
laid
down
the
packet
and
kept
her
hand
upon
it
for
a
moment
was
but
nobly
so
if
an
actress
she
was
cast
by
nature
for
the
great
parts
and
threw
her
soul
into
the
playing
of
them
she
lingered
by
the
table
touching
objects
with
the
tips
of
her
gloved
fingers
as
if
lovingly
and
sadly
at
length
she
seated
herself
in
wilfrid
chair
and
gazed
about
the
room
with
languid
wistful
eyes
her
bosom
heaved
once
or
twice
a
sigh
trembled
to
all
but
a
sob
she
lost
herself
in
reverie
then
the
clock
near
her
chimed
silverly
eleven
beatrice
drew
a
deep
breath
rose
slowly
and
slowly
went
from
the
room
a
cab
took
her
to
baxendale
that
lady
was
at
home
and
alone
reading
in
fact
she
closed
her
book
as
beatrice
entered
and
a
placid
smile
accompanied
her
observation
of
her
niece
magnificence
was
coming
to
make
inquiries
she
said
birks
gave
me
a
disturbing
account
of
you
yesterday
has
your
headache
gone
all
over
beatrice
replied
quietly
make
too
much
of
it
think
it
is
you
who
make
too
little
of
it
you
are
wretchedly
pale
i
that
will
soon
go
i
think
i
must
leave
town
before
long
advise
me
where
shall
i
go
you
do
think
of
going
before
quite
soon
are
mysterious
remarked
baxendale
raising
her
eyebrows
a
little
as
she
smiled
aunt
i
will
be
so
no
longer
i
want
to
you
if
you
will
let
me
do
you
promise
to
answer
the
best
of
my
poor
ability
the
first
question
shall
be
this
when
did
you
last
hear
of
emily
hood
emily
hood
baxendale
had
the
habit
of
controlling
the
display
of
her
emotions
it
was
part
of
her
originality
but
it
was
evident
that
the
question
occasioned
her
extreme
surprise
and
not
a
little
trouble
will
you
tell
me
said
beatrice
in
a
tone
of
calm
interest
a
strange
question
still
if
you
really
desire
to
know
i
heard
from
her
about
six
months
ago
was
in
london
then
baxendale
had
quite
ceased
to
smile
when
any
puzzling
matter
occupied
her
thought
she
always
frowned
very
low
at
present
her
frown
indicated
anxiety
reason
have
you
to
think
she
was
in
london
beatrice
her
being
here
now
beatrice
said
it
with
a
show
of
pleasant
artfulness
holding
her
head
aside
a
little
and
smiling
into
her
aunt
eyes
baxendale
relaxed
her
frown
and
looked
away
you
seen
her
lately
beatrice
continued
have
not
soon
her
for
years
but
you
have
corresponded
with
her
very
long
intervals
before
beatrice
spoke
again
her
aunt
resumed
lay
traps
for
me
my
dear
suppose
you
explain
at
once
your
interest
in
emily
hood
whereabouts
i
wish
to
do
so
i
have
come
to
you
to
talk
about
it
aunt
because
i
know
you
take
things
quietly
and
just
now
i
want
a
little
help
of
the
kind
you
can
give
you
have
guessed
of
course
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
part
of
it
at
least
wilfrid
and
she
have
met
have
met
repeated
the
other
musingly
her
face
still
rather
anxious
what
way
chance
pure
chance
chance
it
was
not
i
suppose
by
chance
that
you
heard
of
the
meeting
wilfrid
told
me
of
it
he
told
me
on
sunday
her
voice
was
a
little
uncertain
me
your
hand
dear
said
baxendale
now
tell
me
the
rest
beatrice
half
sobbed
i
can
now
more
easily
she
continued
with
hurried
utterance
hand
is
just
what
i
wanted
it
is
help
dear
help
but
you
think
i
am
weak
i
could
have
stood
alone
yes
he
told
me
on
sunday
and
that
of
course
was
the
end
his
desire
and
mine
he
was
honest
with
me
it
was
better
than
such
discoveries
when
it
would
have
been
too
late
he
is
going
to
marry
her
were
married
an
hour
ago
baxendale
looked
with
grave
inquiry
into
beatrice
face
incredulity
was
checked
by
what
she
saw
there
she
averted
her
eyes
again
and
both
were
silent
for
awhile
it
is
all
well
over
you
see
beatrice
said
at
length
trying
at
it
seems
as
to
the
well
or
ill
i
ca
say
well
rejoined
beatrice
loves
her
and
he
would
never
have
loved
me
we
ca
help
it
she
has
suffered
dreadful
things
you
see
it
in
her
face
face
went
to
see
her
on
monday
evening
beatrice
explained
with
simplicity
though
her
lips
quivered
asked
leave
of
wilfrid
to
do
so
he
had
told
me
all
her
story
as
he
had
just
heard
it
from
herself
and
i
indeed
i
was
curious
to
see
her
again
then
there
was
another
reason
if
i
saw
her
and
brought
her
to
believe
that
wilfrid
and
i
were
merely
intimate
friends
as
we
used
to
be
how
much
easier
it
would
make
everything
you
understand
me
aunt
baxendale
was
again
looking
at
her
with
grave
searching
eyes
eyes
which
began
to
glimmer
a
little
when
the
light
caught
them
hand
she
held
pressed
more
and
more
closely
in
both
her
own
she
made
no
reply
to
the
last
question
and
the
speaker
went
on
with
a
voice
which
lost
its
clearness
and
seemed
to
come
between
parched
lips
see
how
easy
that
makes
everything
i
want
your
help
of
course
i
told
wilfrid
that
this
was
how
i
should
act
it
is
very
simple
let
us
say
that
i
prefer
to
be
thought
an
unselfish
woman
anyone
can
be
jealous
and
malicious
you
are
to
think
that
i
care
as
little
as
it
would
seem
i
do
yet
know
how
i
am
to
live
but
of
course
i
shall
it
will
come
in
time
it
was
better
they
should
be
married
in
this
way
then
he
must
come
back
after
the
holidays
and
everything
be
smooth
for
him
that
will
be
our
work
yours
and
mine
dear
aunt
you
understand
me
you
will
talk
to
birks
it
will
be
better
from
you
and
then
athel
shall
be
told
yes
it
is
hard
for
me
but
perhaps
not
quite
in
the
way
you
think
i
do
hate
her
indeed
i
do
if
you
knew
that
story
which
you
never
can
i
no
i
do
hate
her
i
kissed
her
aunt
with
my
lips
indeed
she
could
find
me
out
i
acted
too
well
for
that
but
i
could
have
done
it
if
i
had
hated
her
she
is
so
altered
from
what
she
was
you
know
that
i
liked
her
years
ago
she
interested
me
in
a
strange
strange
way
it
seems
to
me
now
that
i
foresaw
how
her
fate
would
be
connected
with
mine
i
knew
that
wilfrid
loved
her
before
anyone
else
had
dreamt
of
such
a
thing
now
promise
your
help
they
gone
away
her
aunt
asked
do
know
it
is
likely
her
face
went
white
to
the
lips
for
a
moment
she
quivered
stay
with
me
said
baxendale
me
here
for
a
day
or
two
i
wished
it
birks
is
all
kindness
but
i
find
it
hard
to
talk
and
she
wo
let
me
be
by
myself
do
think
i
am
ill
no
indeed
no
it
only
rest
that
i
want
it
seems
a
long
time
since
sunday
but
you
have
yet
promised
me
aunt
it
will
be
much
harder
if
i
have
to
do
everything
myself
i
promised
him
that
everything
should
be
made
smooth
i
want
to
show
him
that
my
that
my
love
was
worth
having
it
more
than
all
women
would
do
is
it
aunt
of
course
it
only
that
there
the
pleasure
of
doing
something
for
him
and
he
can
not
help
being
grateful
to
me
as
long
as
he
lives
suppose
i
had
gone
and
told
her
she
would
never
have
married
him
she
was
never
beautiful
you
know
and
now
her
face
is
dreadfully
worn
but
i
think
i
understand
why
he
loves
her
of
course
you
can
not
know
her
as
well
as
i
do
and
you
will
help
me
aunt
you
perfectly
sure
that
they
have
been
married
this
morning
baxendale
asked
with
quiet
earnestness
quite
sure
any
other
case
i
do
know
whether
i
should
have
done
as
you
wish
would
have
tried
to
prevent
it
oh
no
you
are
too
wise
after
all
this
time
and
he
loves
her
as
much
as
ever
do
you
see
how
foolish
it
would
be
to
fret
about
it
it
is
fete
that
all
you
know
we
all
have
our
fate
do
you
know
what
i
used
to
think
mine
would
he
i
feared
madness
my
poor
father
but
i
shall
not
fear
that
now
i
have
gone
through
too
much
my
mind
has
borne
it
but
i
must
have
rest
and
i
can
only
rest
if
i
know
that
you
are
helping
me
you
promise
will
do
my
best
dear
your
best
is
best
indeed
aunt
you
will
go
to
birks
and
tell
her
where
i
am
the
sooner
you
speak
to
her
the
better
i
will
lie
down
if
you
knew
how
i
feel
she
rose
but
stood
with
difficulty
baxendale
put
her
arm
about
her
and
kissed
her
cheek
then
she
led
her
to
another
room
tension
in
beatrice
was
nearing
the
point
of
fever
she
had
begun
the
conversation
with
every
appearance
of
calmness
now
she
was
only
to
be
satisfied
by
immediate
action
towards
the
end
she
had
in
view
every
successive
minute
of
delay
was
an
added
torment
she
pressed
her
aunt
to
go
to
birks
forthwith
that
alone
could
soothe
her
baxendale
yielded
and
set
out
but
it
was
not
to
birks
that
she
paid
her
first
visit
though
it
was
clear
that
beatrice
firmly
believed
all
she
said
baxendale
could
not
accept
this
as
positive
assurance
before
taking
upon
herself
to
announce
such
a
piece
of
news
she
felt
the
need
of
some
further
testimony
she
had
a
difficulty
in
reconciling
precipitate
action
of
this
kind
with
wilfrid
character
as
it
had
of
late
years
developed
itself
political
even
social
ambition
had
become
so
pronounced
in
him
that
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
him
turning
with
such
sudden
vehemence
from
the
path
in
which
every
consideration
of
interest
would
tend
to
hold
him
the
best
of
women
worship
success
and
though
baxendale
well
knew
that
wilfrid
aims
had
suffered
a
degradation
she
could
not
even
apart
from
her
feeling
for
beatrice
welcome
his
return
to
the
high
allegiance
of
former
days
when
it
would
surely
check
or
altogether
terminate
a
brilliant
career
the
situation
had
too
fantastic
a
look
could
it
be
that
beatrice
was
suffering
from
some
delusion
had
a
chance
discovery
of
emily
hood
proximity
together
perhaps
with
some
ambiguous
behaviour
on
wilfrid
part
affected
her
mind
it
was
an
extreme
supposition
but
on
the
whole
as
easy
of
acceptance
as
the
story
beatrice
had
poured
forth
in
pursuit
of
evidence
baxendale
drove
to
the
athels
it
was
about
she
inquired
for
wilfrid
and
heard
with
mingled
feelings
that
he
was
at
home
she
found
him
in
his
study
he
had
before
him
a
little
heap
of
letters
the
contents
of
a
packet
he
had
found
on
his
table
on
entering
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
baxendale
regarded
him
observantly
the
results
of
her
examination
led
her
to
come
to
the
point
at
once
have
just
left
beatrice
she
said
has
been
telling
me
an
extraordinary
story
do
you
know
what
it
was
has
told
you
the
truth
wilfrid
replied
simply
you
were
married
this
morning
wilfrid
bent
his
head
in
assent
baxendale
seated
herself
dear
wilfrid
were
her
next
words
have
been
guilty
of
what
is
commonly
called
a
dishonourable
action
fear
i
have
i
can
only
excuse
myself
by
begging
you
to
believe
that
no
other
course
was
open
to
me
i
have
simply
cut
a
hard
knot
it
was
better
than
wasting
my
own
life
and
others
lives
in
despair
at
its
hopelessness
wilfrid
was
collected
the
leap
taken
he
felt
his
foot
once
more
on
firm
ground
he
felt
too
that
he
had
left
behind
him
much
of
which
he
was
heartily
ashamed
he
was
in
no
mood
to
feign
an
aspect
of
contrition
will
admit
observed
the
lady
this
cutting
of
the
knot
makes
a
rather
harsh
severance
would
be
impertinent
to
say
that
i
am
sorry
for
beatrice
her
behaviour
to
me
has
been
incredibly
magnanimous
and
i
feel
sure
that
her
happiness
as
well
as
my
own
has
been
consulted
i
do
know
in
what
sense
she
has
spoken
to
you
nobly
be
sure
of
it
can
only
thank
her
and
reverence
her
baxendale
remained
for
a
moment
in
thought
she
resumed
know
that
it
is
not
my
part
to
make
useless
scenes
i
began
with
my
hardest
words
and
they
must
stand
beatrice
will
not
die
of
a
broken
heart
happily
and
if
your
wife
is
one
half
as
noble
you
are
indeed
a
fortunate
man
perhaps
we
had
better
talk
no
more
at
present
it
is
possible
you
have
acted
rightly
and
i
must
run
no
risk
of
saying
unkind
things
is
your
father
informed
yet
are
leaving
town
afternoon
go
to
a
distance
i
shall
be
in
town
daily
doubtless
inform
your
father
before
you
leave
shall
do
so
we
will
say
baxendale
gave
her
hand
she
did
not
smile
but
just
shook
her
head
as
she
looked
wilfrid
steadily
in
the
face
it
was
later
in
the
afternoon
when
she
called
upon
birks
she
was
conducted
to
that
lady
boudoir
and
there
found
athel
senior
in
colloquy
with
his
sister
the
subject
of
the
conversation
was
unmistakable
know
asked
birks
with
resignation
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
behind
the
visitor
have
come
to
talk
it
over
with
you
athel
was
standing
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
he
was
rather
redder
in
the
face
than
usual
and
had
clearly
been
delivering
himself
of
ample
periods
baxendale
he
began
have
a
difficulty
in
expressing
myself
on
the
subject
the
affair
is
simply
monstrous
it
indicates
a
form
of
insanity
i
uh
i
uh
in
truth
i
do
know
from
what
point
to
look
at
it
is
beatrice
birks
asked
will
stay
with
me
for
a
day
or
two
replied
baxendale
how
is
she
inquired
athel
sympathetically
of
course
but
not
seriously
i
hope
birks
exclaimed
might
have
had
some
consideration
for
other
people
hero
are
the
friendships
of
a
lifetime
broken
up
on
his
account
do
know
that
that
is
exactly
the
point
of
view
remarked
her
brother
judicially
does
expect
such
things
to
seriously
weigh
i
mean
of
course
when
there
is
reason
on
the
man
side
what
distresses
me
is
the
personal
recklessness
of
the
step
that
is
not
so
great
as
it
appears
put
in
baxendale
quietly
defend
him
exclaimed
birks
not
sure
that
i
should
do
so
but
i
want
to
explain
how
beatrice
regards
it
defends
him
cried
athel
she
does
at
present
there
is
only
one
thing
i
fear
for
her
and
that
is
a
refusal
on
your
part
to
carry
out
her
wishes
beatrice
has
made
up
her
mind
that
as
little
trouble
as
possible
shall
result
i
bring
in
fact
the
most
urgent
request
from
her
that
you
athel
and
you
birks
will
join
in
a
sort
of
conspiracy
to
make
things
smooth
for
wilfrid
she
desires
it
is
no
mere
whim
i
believe
her
health
depends
upon
it
that
no
obstacle
whatever
may
be
put
in
the
way
of
wilfrid
return
to
society
with
his
wife
we
are
to
act
as
though
this
old
engagement
had
come
to
an
end
by
mutual
agreement
and
as
approving
the
marriage
this
is
my
niece
serious
desire
dear
mrs
baxendale
murmured
the
listening
lady
very
extraordinary
are
you
quite
sure
this
surely
is
out
of
the
question
broke
in
her
brother
beatrice
should
make
such
a
request
is
very
admirable
but
i
uh
i
really
athel
paused
as
if
expecting
and
hoping
that
someone
would
defeat
his
objections
admit
it
sounds
rather
unreal
pursued
baxendale
fortunately
i
can
give
you
good
evidence
of
her
sincerity
she
has
visited
the
lady
who
is
now
athel
and
that
with
the
express
purpose
of
representing
herself
as
nothing
more
than
a
friend
of
wilfrid
you
remember
she
had
a
slight
acquaintance
with
miss
hood
after
this
i
do
see
how
we
can
refuse
to
aid
her
plan
visited
miss
hood
asked
birks
with
the
mild
amazement
of
a
lady
who
respects
her
emotions
wilfrid
know
that
asked
his
permission
to
go
is
altogether
beyond
me
confessed
athel
drawing
down
his
waistcoat
and
taking
a
turn
across
the
room
of
course
if
they
have
been
amusing
themselves
with
a
kind
of
game
well
we
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
regret
that
our
invitation
to
join
in
it
has
come
rather
late
for
my
own
part
i
was
disposed
to
take
a
somewhat
more
serious
view
of
course
it
no
good
throwing
away
one
indignation
i
uh
but
what
is
your
own
attitude
with
regard
to
this
proposal
mrs
baxendale
think
i
must
be
content
to
do
my
niece
bidding
said
the
lady
addressed
one
thing
it
seems
to
me
being
lost
sight
of
came
from
birks
in
the
disinterested
tone
of
a
person
who
wishes
to
deliver
with
all
clearness
an
unpleasant
suggestion
are
very
much
in
the
dark
as
to
miss
hood
i
should
say
athel
antecedents
you
yourself
she
regarded
baxendale
that
her
story
is
very
mysterious
if
we
are
asked
to
receive
her
really
does
this
occur
to
you
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
amid
general
silence
beatrice
came
forward
birks
rose
quickly
and
met
her
baxendale
understood
at
a
glance
what
had
brought
her
niece
here
agitation
had
grown
insupportable
it
was
not
in
beatrice
character
to
lie
still
whilst
others
decided
matters
in
which
she
had
supreme
interest
the
more
difficult
her
position
the
stronger
she
found
herself
to
support
it
the
culmination
of
the
drama
could
not
be
acted
with
her
behind
the
scenes
birks
with
a
whispered
word
or
two
led
her
to
a
seat
beatrice
looked
at
her
aunt
then
at
athel
the
proud
beauty
of
her
face
was
never
more
impressive
she
smiled
as
if
some
pleasant
trifle
were
under
discussion
heard
your
voice
as
i
came
in
she
said
to
birks
bending
towards
her
gracefully
you
on
my
side
afraid
not
dear
just
then
was
the
reply
given
in
a
corresponding
tone
of
affectionateness
will
tell
me
what
you
were
saying
athel
looked
as
uncomfortable
as
even
an
english
gentleman
can
in
such
a
situation
baxendale
seemed
to
be
finding
amusement
in
observing
him
the
lady
appealed
to
plucked
for
a
moment
at
her
sleeve
i
make
a
guess
beatrice
pursued
had
something
to
do
with
the
private
circumstances
of
the
lady
wilfrid
athel
has
married
beatrice
it
had
let
me
help
you
over
that
obstacle
dear
birks
i
have
heard
from
herself
a
full
explanation
of
what
you
are
uneasy
about
and
if
i
were
at
liberty
to
repeat
it
you
would
know
that
she
has
been
dreadfully
unhappy
and
has
endured
things
which
would
have
killed
most
women
all
because
of
her
loyalty
and
purity
of
heart
i
think
i
may
ask
you
to
give
as
much
effect
to
my
words
as
if
you
knew
everything
athel
is
in
every
respect
worthy
to
become
a
member
of
your
family
her
voice
began
to
express
emotion
athel
are
not
against
me
it
is
so
hard
to
find
no
sympathy
i
have
set
my
heart
on
this
perhaps
i
seem
to
ask
a
great
deal
but
i
have
i
not
some
little
dear
miss
redwing
broke
in
athel
then
correcting
himself
dear
beatrice
no
words
could
convey
the
anxiety
i
feel
to
be
of
service
to
you
you
see
how
difficult
it
is
for
me
to
speak
decidedly
but
i
assure
you
that
i
could
not
possibly
act
in
opposition
to
your
expressed
desire
perhaps
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
withdraw
i
am
sure
these
ladies
his
speech
hung
in
and
he
stood
nervously
tapping
his
fingers
with
his
eyeglass
please
remain
exclaimed
beatrice
you
are
not
against
me
birks
you
wo
refuse
to
believe
what
i
have
told
you
the
two
ladies
glanced
at
each
other
in
baxendale
look
there
was
appeal
i
believe
you
implicitly
my
dear
beatrice
said
birks
brother
is
the
one
to
decide
you
are
mistaken
in
thinking
i
oppose
your
wish
how
could
i
the
last
words
were
very
sweetly
said
with
a
smile
which
did
not
pass
beyond
her
lips
beatrice
rose
from
her
seat
and
held
her
hand
to
athel
it
is
understood
when
wilfrid
brings
his
wife
to
you
you
receive
her
with
all
kindness
i
have
your
promise
athel
drew
himself
up
very
straight
pressed
the
offered
hand
and
said
shall
be
as
you
wish
beatrice
returned
with
baxendale
her
desire
to
be
alone
was
respected
during
the
rest
of
the
day
going
to
her
the
last
thing
at
night
her
aunt
was
reassured
weariness
had
followed
upon
nervous
strain
and
the
beautiful
eyes
seemed
longing
for
sleep
but
in
the
morning
appearances
were
not
so
hopeful
the
night
had
after
all
been
a
troubled
one
beatrice
declined
breakfast
and
having
dressed
with
effort
lay
on
a
sofa
her
eyes
closed
at
noon
baxendale
came
near
and
said
gently
you
are
not
going
to
be
ill
the
sufferer
stirred
a
little
looked
in
her
aunt
face
rose
to
a
sitting
position
she
laughed
in
a
forced
way
that
would
never
do
ill
after
all
why
that
would
spoil
everything
are
you
going
out
this
morning
not
i
should
only
have
done
some
idle
shopping
you
shall
do
the
shopping
and
i
will
go
with
you
yes
yes
i
will
go
it
is
the
only
way
let
us
go
where
we
shall
see
people
i
wish
to
i
will
be
ready
in
five
minutes
beatrice
do
fear
my
looks
you
shall
see
if
i
betray
myself
quick
quick
to
regent
street
bond
street
where
we
shall
gee
people
i
shall
be
ready
before
you
they
set
forth
and
beatrice
had
no
illness
chapter
xxvi
once
more
at
the
firs
wilfrid
had
decided
to
make
this
his
abode
it
was
near
enough
to
london
to
allow
of
his
going
backwards
and
forwards
as
often
as
might
be
necessary
his
father
town
house
offered
the
means
of
change
for
emily
and
supplied
him
with
a
in
time
of
session
by
limiting
his
attendance
at
the
house
as
far
as
decency
would
allow
he
was
able
to
enjoy
with
small
interruption
the
quiet
of
his
home
in
surrey
and
a
growing
certainty
that
the
life
of
the
present
parliament
would
be
short
encouraged
him
in
looking
forward
to
the
day
when
politics
would
no
longer
exist
for
him
he
and
emily
established
themselves
at
the
firs
towards
the
end
of
december
having
spent
a
week
with
athel
on
their
return
from
the
continent
emily
health
had
improved
but
there
was
no
likelihood
that
she
would
ever
be
other
than
a
delicate
flower
to
be
jealously
guarded
from
the
sky
ruder
breath
by
him
to
whom
she
was
a
life
within
life
ambition
as
he
formerly
understood
it
had
no
more
meaning
for
wilfrid
the
fine
ardour
of
his
being
rejected
grosser
nourishment
and
burned
in
towards
the
woman
whom
he
after
all
called
wife
emily
was
an
unfailing
inspiration
by
her
side
the
nobler
zeal
of
his
youth
renewed
itself
in
the
light
of
her
pure
soul
he
saw
the
world
as
poetry
and
strove
for
that
detachment
of
the
intellect
which
in
emily
was
a
gift
of
nature
she
emily
emily
athel
as
she
joyed
to
write
herself
moved
in
her
new
sphere
like
a
spirit
humbled
by
victory
over
fate
it
was
a
mild
winter
the
surrey
hills
were
tender
against
the
brief
daylight
and
gardens
breathed
the
freshness
of
evergreens
when
the
sun
trembled
over
the
landscape
for
a
short
hour
emily
loved
to
stray
as
far
as
that
hollow
on
the
heath
where
she
had
sat
with
wilfrid
years
ago
and
heard
him
for
the
first
time
speak
freely
of
his
aims
and
his
hopes
that
spot
was
sacred
as
she
stood
there
beneath
the
faint
blue
of
the
winter
sky
all
the
exquisite
sadness
of
life
the
memory
of
those
whom
death
had
led
to
his
kindly
haven
the
sorrows
of
love
the
dear
heartache
for
woe
passed
into
eternity
touched
the
deepest
fountains
of
her
nature
and
made
dim
her
eyes
she
would
not
have
had
life
other
than
it
was
given
to
her
for
she
had
learned
the
secrets
of
infinite
passion
in
the
sunless
valleys
of
despair
she
rested
in
the
last
few
months
she
had
traversed
a
whole
existence
repose
was
needful
that
she
might
assimilate
all
her
new
experiences
and
range
in
due
order
the
gifts
which
joy
had
lavishly
heaped
upon
her
the
skies
of
the
south
the
murmur
of
blue
seas
on
shores
of
glorious
name
the
shrines
of
art
the
hallowed
scenes
where
earth
greatest
have
loved
and
wrought
these
were
no
longer
a
dream
with
her
bodily
eyes
she
had
looked
upon
greece
and
italy
and
to
have
done
so
was
a
consecration
it
cast
a
light
upon
her
brows
to
me
of
rome
those
were
always
her
words
when
wilfrid
came
to
her
side
in
the
evening
to
me
of
rome
as
you
alone
can
and
as
wilfrid
recalled
their
life
in
the
world
holy
of
holies
she
closed
her
eyes
for
the
full
rapture
of
the
inner
light
and
her
heart
sang
praise
wilfrid
was
awed
by
his
blessedness
there
were
times
when
he
scarcely
dared
to
take
in
his
own
that
hand
which
was
the
symbol
of
life
made
perfect
emily
uttered
thoughts
which
made
him
fear
to
profane
her
purity
by
his
touch
she
realised
to
the
uttermost
his
ideal
of
womanhood
none
the
less
so
that
it
seemed
no
child
would
be
born
of
her
to
trouble
the
exclusiveness
of
their
love
he
clad
her
in
queenly
garments
and
did
homage
at
her
feet
her
beauty
was
all
for
him
for
though
emily
could
grace
any
scene
she
found
no
pleasure
in
society
and
the
hours
of
absence
from
home
were
to
wilfrid
full
of
anxiety
to
return
all
their
plans
were
for
solitude
life
was
too
short
for
more
than
the
inevitable
concessions
to
the
outside
world
but
one
morning
in
february
emily
eye
fell
upon
an
announcement
in
the
newspaper
which
excited
in
her
a
wish
to
go
up
to
town
among
the
list
of
singers
at
a
concert
to
be
given
that
day
she
had
caught
the
name
of
miss
beatrice
redwing
it
was
saturday
wilfrid
had
no
occasion
for
leaving
home
and
already
they
had
enjoyed
in
advance
the
two
unbroken
days
i
should
indeed
like
to
hear
her
emily
said
she
seems
to
sing
so
rarely
has
only
just
returned
to
england
wilfrid
remarked
they
had
heard
of
beatrice
having
been
in
florence
a
week
or
two
prior
to
their
own
stay
there
she
was
travelling
with
the
baxendales
emily
was
anxious
to
meet
her
and
wilfrid
had
held
out
a
hope
that
this
might
come
about
in
italy
but
circumstances
had
proved
adverse
you
seen
her
emily
inquired
her
husband
had
not
he
seemed
at
first
a
little
disinclined
to
go
up
for
the
concert
but
on
emily
becoming
silent
he
hastened
to
give
a
cheerful
acquiescence
we
see
her
she
went
on
to
ask
doubt
we
can
it
only
the
facing
of
my
aunt
on
a
sunday
afternoon
surely
that
is
needless
wilfrid
could
we
go
and
see
her
quietly
she
would
be
at
home
in
the
morning
i
should
think
should
think
so
we
make
inquiries
they
left
home
early
in
the
afternoon
and
procured
tickets
on
their
way
from
the
station
to
athel
their
arrival
being
quite
unexpected
they
found
that
athel
had
loft
town
for
a
day
or
two
it
was
all
that
emily
needed
for
the
completing
of
her
pleasure
her
was
scrupulously
polite
in
his
behaviour
to
her
but
the
politeness
fell
a
little
short
as
yet
of
entire
ease
and
conversation
with
him
involved
effort
she
ran
a
risk
of
letting
wilfrid
perceive
the
gladness
with
which
she
discovered
an
empty
house
he
did
in
fact
attribute
to
its
true
cause
the
she
showed
as
they
sat
together
at
dinner
and
smiled
to
think
that
he
himself
shared
in
the
feeling
of
relief
there
were
reasons
why
he
could
not
look
forward
to
the
evening
with
unalloyed
happiness
but
the
unwonted
gaiety
which
shone
on
face
and
gave
a
new
melody
to
her
voice
moved
him
to
tenderness
and
gratitude
he
felt
that
it
would
be
well
to
listen
again
to
the
music
of
that
strong
heart
whose
pain
had
been
his
bliss
he
overcame
his
ignoble
anxieties
and
went
to
the
concert
as
to
a
sacred
office
their
seats
owing
to
lateness
in
applying
for
them
were
not
in
the
best
part
of
the
hall
immediately
behind
them
was
the
first
row
of
a
cheaper
section
and
two
men
of
indifferent
behaviour
were
seated
there
within
they
were
discussing
the
various
names
upon
the
programme
as
if
for
the
enlightenment
of
their
neighbours
when
emily
had
been
sitting
for
a
few
minutes
she
found
that
it
had
been
unwise
to
leave
her
mantle
in
the
there
was
a
bad
draught
wilfrid
went
to
recover
it
whilst
waiting
emily
became
aware
that
the
men
behind
her
were
talking
of
miss
redwing
she
listened
married
i
think
eh
said
one
to
have
been
you
mean
why
was
it
you
told
me
the
story
o
no
it
was
drummond
drummond
knows
her
people
i
think
story
eh
she
was
to
have
married
a
member
of
parliament
what
the
deuce
was
his
name
something
that
reminded
me
of
a
i
remember
was
it
blair
no
athel
that
the
name
did
it
come
off
then
the
honourable
member
found
somebody
he
liked
better
it
was
not
the
end
of
the
conversation
but
just
then
the
conductor
rose
in
his
place
and
there
was
wilfrid
returned
at
the
same
moment
he
noticed
that
emily
shivered
as
he
put
the
covering
on
her
shoulders
when
he
was
seated
she
looked
at
him
so
strangely
that
he
asked
her
in
a
whisper
what
was
the
matter
emily
shook
her
head
and
seemed
to
fix
her
attention
on
the
music
beatrice
redwing
was
the
third
singer
to
come
forward
whilst
she
sang
emily
frequently
looked
at
her
husband
wilfrid
did
not
notice
it
he
was
absorbed
in
listening
towards
the
end
emily
too
lost
thought
of
everything
save
the
magic
with
which
the
air
was
charged
there
was
vociferous
demand
for
an
encore
and
beatrice
gave
another
song
when
the
interval
was
reached
emily
asked
her
husband
if
he
would
leave
the
hall
she
gave
no
reason
and
wilfrid
did
not
question
her
when
they
were
in
the
carriage
she
said
the
draught
had
been
too
severe
wilfrid
kept
silence
he
was
troubled
by
inexplicable
misgivings
servants
hastened
to
light
the
on
their
arrival
earlier
than
was
expected
emily
threw
off
her
wraps
and
seated
herself
near
the
fire
you
suffer
from
the
chill
wilfrid
asked
approaching
her
as
if
with
diffidence
she
turned
her
face
to
him
gazing
with
the
sadness
which
was
so
much
more
natural
to
her
than
the
joy
of
two
hours
ago
was
not
the
draught
that
made
me
come
away
she
said
with
gentle
directness
must
tell
you
what
it
was
wilfrid
i
can
not
keep
any
of
my
thoughts
from
you
me
he
murmured
standing
by
her
she
related
the
substance
of
the
conversation
she
had
overheard
always
keeping
her
eyes
on
him
it
true
is
true
emily
between
him
and
her
there
could
be
no
paltry
embarrassments
a
direct
question
touching
both
so
deeply
could
be
answered
only
in
one
way
if
emily
had
suffered
from
a
brief
distrust
his
look
and
voice
sorrowful
but
frank
as
though
he
faced
omniscience
restored
her
courage
at
once
there
might
be
grief
henceforth
but
it
was
shared
between
them
he
spoke
on
and
made
all
plain
then
at
the
last
felt
it
to
be
almost
impossible
that
you
should
net
some
day
know
i
could
not
tell
you
perhaps
on
her
account
as
much
as
on
my
own
but
now
i
may
say
what
i
had
no
words
for
before
she
loved
me
and
i
believed
that
i
could
return
her
love
when
i
met
you
how
could
i
marry
her
a
stranger
sees
my
conduct
you
have
heard
how
it
is
you
who
alone
can
judge
me
she
came
to
me
in
that
way
emily
murmured
could
not
only
lose
but
give
her
hand
to
the
woman
who
robbed
her
take
my
part
with
everyone
force
herself
to
show
a
bright
face
do
her
best
to
have
it
understood
that
it
was
she
herself
who
broke
off
the
marriage
all
this
i
go
to
her
wilfrid
would
it
be
cruel
to
go
to
her
i
wish
to
speak
oh
not
one
word
that
would
betray
my
knowledge
but
to
say
that
i
love
her
do
you
think
i
may
go
can
not
advise
you
emily
wait
until
the
morning
and
do
then
what
you
think
best
she
decided
to
go
beatrice
still
lived
with
birks
and
it
was
probable
that
she
would
be
alone
on
sunday
morning
it
proved
to
be
so
wilfrid
waited
more
than
an
hour
for
emily
return
when
at
length
she
entered
to
him
he
saw
that
there
was
deep
content
on
her
countenance
emily
embraced
her
husband
and
laid
her
head
upon
his
breast
he
could
hear
her
sigh
gently
wishes
to
see
you
wilfrid
received
you
kindly
will
tell
you
all
when
i
have
had
time
to
think
of
it
but
she
was
sorry
you
did
not
come
with
me
will
you
go
she
will
be
alone
this
afternoon
they
held
each
other
in
silence
then
emily
raising
an
awed
face
asked
softly
does
she
find
her
strength
is
her
nature
so
spotless
that
is
her
highest
joy
wilfrid
i
could
have
asked
pardon
at
her
feet
my
heart
bled
for
her
you
least
of
all
should
wonder
at
the
strength
which
comes
of
high
motive
but
to
surrender
you
to
another
and
to
witness
that
happiness
was
not
my
perhaps
a
form
of
selfishness
i
only
shrank
from
love
because
i
dreaded
the
reproaches
of
my
own
heart
i
did
good
to
no
one
was
only
anxious
to
save
myself
she
i
dare
not
think
of
it
my
nature
is
so
weak
take
your
love
from
me
and
you
take
my
life
wilfrid
heart
leaped
with
the
wild
joy
of
a
mountain
torrent
will
not
always
be
alone
he
said
perhaps
with
the
readiness
of
the
supremely
happy
to
prophesy
smooth
things
for
all
there
came
the
answer
of
gentle
reproach
loving
you
wilfrid
that
is
how
it
seems
to
you
there
is
second
love
often
truer
than
the
first
the
first
was
not
love
indeed
if
i
had
never
seen
you
again
what
meaning
would
love
have
ever
had
for
me
apart
from
your
name
i
only
dreamed
of
it
till
i
knew
you
then
it
was
love
first
and
last
wilfrid
my
own
my
husband
my
love
till
i
die
