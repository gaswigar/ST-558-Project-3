what
is
the
mind
psychology
is
generally
considered
to
be
the
science
of
mind
although
more
properly
it
is
the
science
of
mental
states
thoughts
feelings
and
acts
of
volition
it
was
formerly
the
custom
of
writers
on
the
subject
of
psychology
to
begin
by
an
attempt
to
define
and
describe
the
nature
of
mind
before
proceeding
to
a
consideration
of
the
subject
of
the
various
mental
spates
and
activities
but
more
recent
authorities
have
rebelled
against
this
demand
and
have
claimed
that
it
is
no
more
reasonable
to
hold
that
psychology
should
be
held
to
an
explanation
of
the
ultimate
nature
of
mind
than
it
is
that
physical
science
be
held
to
an
explanation
of
the
ultimate
nature
of
matter
the
attempt
to
explain
the
ultimate
nature
of
either
is
futile
no
actual
necessity
exists
for
explanation
in
either
case
physics
may
explain
the
phenomena
of
matter
and
psychology
the
phenomena
of
mind
without
regard
to
the
ultimate
nature
of
the
substance
of
either
the
science
of
physics
has
progressed
steadily
during
the
past
century
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
theories
regarding
the
ultimate
nature
of
matter
have
been
revolutionized
during
that
period
the
facts
of
the
phenomena
of
matter
remain
notwithstanding
the
change
of
theory
regarding
the
nature
of
matter
itself
science
demands
and
holds
fast
to
facts
regarding
theories
as
but
working
hypotheses
at
the
best
some
one
has
said
that
theories
are
but
the
bubbles
with
which
the
children
of
science
amuse
themselves
science
holds
several
though
opposing
theories
regarding
the
nature
of
electricity
but
the
of
the
phenomena
of
electricity
and
the
application
thereof
are
agreed
upon
by
the
disputing
theorists
and
so
it
is
with
psychology
the
facts
regarding
mental
states
are
agreed
upon
and
methods
of
developing
mental
powers
are
effectively
employed
without
regard
to
whether
mind
is
a
product
of
the
brain
or
the
brain
merely
an
organ
of
the
mind
the
fact
that
the
brain
and
nervous
system
are
employed
in
the
phenomena
of
thought
is
conceded
by
all
and
that
is
all
that
is
necessary
for
a
basis
for
the
science
of
psychology
disputes
regarding
the
ultimate
nature
of
mind
are
now
generally
passed
over
to
the
philosophers
and
metaphysicians
while
psychology
devotes
its
entire
attention
to
studying
the
laws
of
mental
activities
and
to
discovering
methods
of
mental
development
even
philosophy
is
beginning
to
tire
of
the
eternal
why
and
is
devoting
its
attention
to
the
how
phase
of
things
the
pragmatic
spirit
has
invaded
the
field
of
philosophy
expressing
itself
in
the
words
of
william
james
who
said
pragmatism
is
the
attitude
of
looking
away
from
first
things
principles
categories
supposed
necessities
and
of
looking
forward
toward
last
things
modern
psychology
is
essentially
pragmatic
in
its
treatment
of
the
subject
of
the
mind
leaving
to
metaphysics
the
old
arguments
and
disputes
regarding
the
ultimate
nature
of
mind
it
bends
all
its
energies
upon
discovering
the
laws
of
mental
activities
and
states
and
developing
methods
whereby
the
mind
may
be
trained
to
perform
better
and
more
work
to
conserve
its
energies
to
concentrate
its
forces
to
modern
psychology
the
mind
is
to
be
not
merely
something
about
which
to
speculate
and
theorize
while
the
metaphysicians
deplore
this
tendency
the
practical
people
of
the
world
rejoice
mind
defined
mind
is
defined
as
the
faculty
or
power
whereby
thinking
creatures
feel
think
and
will
this
definition
is
inadequate
and
circular
in
nature
but
this
is
unavoidable
for
mind
can
be
defined
only
in
its
own
terms
and
only
by
reference
to
its
own
processes
mind
except
in
reference
to
its
own
activities
can
not
be
defined
or
conceived
it
is
known
to
itself
only
through
its
activities
mind
without
mental
states
is
a
mere
abstraction
a
word
without
a
corresponding
mental
image
or
concept
sir
william
hamilton
expressed
the
matter
as
clearly
as
possible
when
he
said
what
we
mean
by
mind
is
simply
perceives
thinks
feels
wills
and
desires
without
the
perceiving
thinking
feeling
willing
and
desiring
it
is
impossible
to
form
a
clear
conception
or
mental
image
of
mind
deprived
of
its
phenomena
it
becomes
the
merest
abstraction
think
about
that
which
thinks
perhaps
the
simplest
method
of
conveying
the
idea
of
the
existence
and
nature
of
the
mind
is
that
attributed
to
a
celebrated
german
teacher
of
psychology
who
was
wont
to
begin
his
course
by
bidding
his
students
think
of
something
his
desk
for
example
then
he
would
say
now
think
of
which
thinks
about
the
then
after
a
pause
he
would
add
this
thing
which
thinks
about
the
desk
and
about
which
you
are
now
thinking
is
the
subject
matter
of
our
study
of
psychology
the
professor
could
not
have
said
more
had
he
lectured
for
a
month
professor
gordy
has
well
said
on
this
point
the
mind
must
either
be
thinks
feels
and
wills
or
it
must
be
the
thoughts
feelings
and
acts
of
will
of
which
we
are
conscious
mental
facts
in
one
word
but
what
can
we
know
about
thinks
feels
and
wills
and
what
can
we
find
out
about
it
where
is
it
you
will
probably
say
in
the
brain
but
if
you
are
speaking
literally
if
you
say
that
it
is
in
the
brain
as
a
pencil
is
in
the
pocket
then
you
must
mean
that
it
takes
up
room
that
it
occupies
space
and
that
would
make
it
very
much
like
a
material
thing
in
truth
the
more
carefully
you
consider
it
the
more
plainly
you
will
see
what
thinking
men
have
known
for
a
long
time
that
we
do
not
know
and
can
not
learn
anything
about
the
thing
which
thinks
and
feels
and
wills
it
is
beyond
the
range
of
human
knowledge
the
books
which
define
psychology
as
the
science
of
mind
have
not
a
word
to
say
about
that
which
thinks
and
feels
and
wills
they
are
entirely
taken
up
with
these
thoughts
and
feelings
and
acts
of
the
will
mental
facts
in
a
word
trying
to
tell
us
what
they
are
and
to
arrange
them
in
classes
and
tell
us
the
circumstances
or
conditions
under
which
they
exist
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
better
to
define
psychology
as
science
of
the
experiences
phenomena
or
facts
of
the
mind
soul
or
self
of
mental
facts
in
a
in
view
of
the
facts
of
the
case
and
following
the
example
of
the
best
of
the
modern
authorities
in
this
book
we
shall
leave
the
consideration
of
the
question
of
the
ultimate
nature
of
mind
to
the
metaphysicians
and
shall
confine
ourselves
to
the
the
laws
governing
them
and
the
best
methods
of
governing
and
using
them
in
the
business
of
life
the
classification
and
method
of
development
to
be
followed
in
this
book
is
as
follows
i
the
mechanism
of
mental
states
the
brain
nervous
system
sense
organs
etc
ii
the
fact
of
consciousness
and
its
planes
iii
mental
processes
or
faculties
sensation
and
perception
representation
or
imagination
and
memory
feeling
or
emotion
intellect
or
reason
and
understanding
will
or
volition
mental
states
depend
upon
the
physical
mechanism
for
manifestation
whatever
may
be
the
ultimate
nature
of
mind
mental
states
whatever
their
special
character
will
be
found
to
fit
into
one
of
the
above
five
general
classes
of
mental
activities
chapter
ii
the
mechanism
of
mental
states
the
mechanism
of
mental
states
the
mental
machinery
by
means
of
which
we
feel
think
and
will
consists
of
the
brain
nervous
system
and
the
organs
of
sense
no
matter
what
may
be
the
real
nature
of
mind
no
matter
what
may
be
the
theory
held
regarding
its
activities
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
mind
is
dependent
upon
this
mechanism
for
the
manifestation
of
what
we
know
as
mental
states
wonderful
as
is
the
mind
it
is
seen
to
be
dependent
upon
this
physical
mechanism
for
the
expression
of
its
activities
and
this
dependence
is
not
upon
the
brain
alone
but
also
upon
the
entire
nervous
system
the
best
authorities
agree
that
the
higher
and
more
complex
mental
states
are
but
an
evolution
of
simple
sensation
and
that
they
are
dependent
upon
sensation
for
their
raw
material
of
feeling
and
thought
therefore
it
is
proper
that
we
begin
by
a
consideration
of
the
machinery
of
sensation
this
necessitates
a
previous
consideration
of
the
nerves
the
nerves
the
body
is
traversed
by
an
intricate
system
of
nerves
which
has
been
likened
to
a
great
telegraph
system
the
nerves
transmit
sensations
from
the
various
parts
of
the
body
to
the
great
receiving
office
of
the
brain
they
also
serve
to
transmit
the
motor
impulses
from
the
brain
to
the
various
parts
of
the
body
which
impulses
result
in
motion
of
appropriate
parts
of
the
body
there
are
also
other
nerves
with
which
we
have
no
concern
in
this
book
but
which
perform
certain
physiological
functions
such
as
digestion
secretion
excretion
and
circulation
our
chief
concern
at
this
point
is
with
the
sensory
nerves
the
sensory
nerves
convey
the
impressions
of
the
outside
world
to
the
brain
the
brain
is
the
great
central
station
of
the
sensory
nerves
the
latter
having
countless
sending
stations
in
all
parts
of
the
body
the
wires
terminating
in
the
skin
when
these
nervous
terminal
stations
are
irritated
or
excited
they
send
to
the
brain
messages
calling
for
attention
this
is
true
not
only
of
the
nerves
of
touch
or
feeling
but
also
of
those
concerned
with
the
respective
senses
of
sight
smell
taste
and
hearing
in
fact
the
best
authorities
hold
that
all
the
five
senses
are
but
an
evolution
of
the
primary
sense
of
touch
or
feeling
the
sense
of
touch
the
nerves
of
the
sense
of
touch
have
their
ending
in
the
outer
covering
or
skin
of
the
body
they
report
with
other
physical
objects
by
means
of
these
reports
we
are
aware
not
only
of
contact
with
the
outside
object
but
also
of
many
facts
concerning
the
nature
of
that
object
as
for
instance
its
degree
of
hardness
roughness
and
its
temperature
some
of
these
nerve
ends
are
very
sensitive
as
for
example
those
of
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
finger
ends
while
others
are
comparatively
lacking
in
sensitiveness
as
for
illustration
those
of
the
back
certain
of
these
sensory
nerves
confine
themselves
to
reporting
contact
and
degrees
of
pressure
while
others
concern
themselves
solely
with
reporting
the
degrees
of
temperature
of
the
objects
with
which
their
ends
come
in
contact
some
of
the
latter
respond
to
the
higher
degrees
of
heat
while
others
respond
only
to
the
lower
degrees
of
cold
the
nerves
of
certain
parts
of
the
body
respond
more
readily
and
distinctly
to
temperature
than
do
those
of
other
parts
to
illustrate
the
nerves
of
the
cheek
are
quite
responsive
to
heat
impressions
the
sense
of
sight
the
nerves
of
the
sense
of
sight
terminate
in
the
complex
optical
apparatus
which
in
popular
terminology
is
known
as
the
eye
what
is
known
as
the
retina
is
a
very
sensitive
nervous
membrane
which
lines
the
inner
back
part
of
the
eye
and
in
which
the
fibers
of
the
optic
nerve
terminate
the
optical
instrument
of
the
eye
conveys
the
focused
light
vibrations
to
the
nerves
of
the
retina
from
which
the
impulse
is
transmitted
to
the
brain
but
contrary
to
the
popular
notion
the
nerves
of
the
eye
do
not
gauge
distances
nor
form
inferences
of
any
kind
that
is
distinctly
the
work
of
the
mind
the
simple
office
of
the
optical
nerves
consists
in
reporting
color
and
degrees
of
intensity
of
the
light
waves
the
sense
of
hearing
the
nerves
of
the
sense
of
hearing
terminate
in
the
inner
part
of
the
ear
the
tympanum
or
ear
drum
receives
the
sound
vibrations
entering
the
cavities
of
the
ear
and
intensifying
and
adapting
them
it
passes
them
on
to
the
ends
of
the
auditory
nerve
in
the
internal
ear
which
conveys
the
sensation
to
the
brain
the
auditory
nerve
reports
to
the
brain
the
degrees
of
pitch
intensity
quality
and
harmony
respectively
of
the
sound
waves
reaching
the
tympanum
as
is
well
known
there
are
certain
vibrations
of
sound
which
are
too
low
for
the
auditory
nerve
to
register
and
others
too
high
for
it
to
record
both
classes
however
capable
of
being
recorded
by
scientific
instruments
it
is
also
regarded
as
certain
that
some
of
the
lower
animals
are
conscious
of
sound
vibrations
which
are
not
registered
by
the
human
auditory
nerves
the
sense
of
smell
the
nerves
of
the
sense
of
smell
terminate
in
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
nostrils
in
order
that
these
nerves
report
the
odor
of
outside
objects
actual
contact
of
minute
particles
of
the
object
with
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
nostrils
is
necessary
this
is
possible
only
by
the
passage
through
the
nostrils
of
air
containing
these
particles
mere
nearness
to
the
nostril
will
not
suffice
these
particles
are
for
the
most
part
composed
of
tenuous
gases
certain
substances
affect
the
olfactory
nerves
much
more
than
do
others
the
difference
arising
from
the
chemical
composition
of
the
substance
the
olfactory
nerves
convey
the
report
to
the
brain
the
sense
of
taste
the
nerves
of
the
sense
of
taste
terminate
in
the
tongue
or
rather
in
the
tiny
cells
of
the
tongue
which
are
called
taste
buds
substances
taken
into
the
mouth
chemically
affect
these
tiny
cells
and
an
impulse
is
transmitted
to
the
gustatory
nerves
which
then
report
the
sensation
to
the
brain
the
authorities
claim
that
taste
sensations
may
be
reduced
to
five
general
classes
viz
sweet
bitter
sour
salty
and
hot
there
are
certain
nerve
centers
having
important
offices
in
the
production
and
expression
of
mental
states
located
in
the
skull
and
in
the
spinal
column
the
brain
and
the
spinal
cord
which
we
shall
consider
in
the
following
chapter
chapter
iii
the
great
nerve
centers
the
great
nerve
centers
which
play
an
important
part
in
the
production
and
expression
of
mental
states
are
those
of
the
brain
and
spinal
cord
respectively
the
spinal
cord
the
spinal
cord
is
that
cord
or
rope
of
nerve
substance
which
is
inclosed
in
the
spinal
column
or
backbone
it
leaves
the
lower
part
of
the
skull
and
extends
downward
in
the
interior
of
the
spinal
column
for
about
eighteen
inches
it
is
continuous
with
the
brain
however
and
it
is
difficult
to
determine
where
one
begins
and
the
other
ends
it
is
composed
of
a
mass
of
gray
matter
surrounded
by
a
covering
of
white
matter
from
the
spinal
cord
along
its
length
emerge
pairs
of
spinal
nerves
which
branch
out
to
each
side
of
the
body
and
connect
with
the
various
smaller
nerves
extending
to
all
parts
of
the
system
the
spinal
cord
is
the
great
central
cable
of
the
nervous
telegraphic
system
and
any
injury
to
or
obstruction
of
it
cripples
or
paralyzes
those
portions
of
the
body
the
nerves
of
which
enter
the
spinal
cord
below
the
seat
of
the
injury
or
obstruction
injuries
or
obstructions
of
this
kind
not
only
inhibit
the
sensory
reports
from
the
affected
area
but
also
inhibit
the
motor
impulses
from
the
brain
which
are
intended
to

the
ganglia
or
tiny
brains
what
are
known
as
ganglia
or
tiny
bunches
of
nerve
cells
are
found
in
various
parts
of
the
nervous
system
including
the
spinal
nerves
these
groups
of
nerve
cells
are
sometimes
called
little
brains
and
perform
quite
important
offices
in
the
mechanism
of
thought
and
action
the
spinal
ganglia
receive
sensory
reports
and
issue
motor
impulses
in
many
cases
without
troubling
the
central
brain
regarding
the
matter
these
activities
are
known
as
reflex
nervous
action
reflex
action
what
is
known
as
reflex
nervous
action
is
one
of
the
most
wonderful
of
the
activities
of
the
nervous
and
mental
mechanism
and
the
knowledge
thereof
usually
comes
as
a
surprise
to
the
average
person
for
he
is
generally
under
the
impression
that
these
activities
are
possible
only
to
the
central
brain
it
is
a
fact
that
not
only
is
the
central
brain
really
a
trinity
of
three
brains
but
that
in
addition
to
these
every
one
has
a
great
number
of
little
brains
distributed
over
his
nervous
system
any
and
all
of
which
are
capable
of
receiving
sensory
reports
and
also
of
sending
forth
motor
impulses
it
is
quite
worth
while
for
one
to
become
acquainted
with
this
wonderful
form
of
activity
a
cinder
enters
the
eye
the
report
reaches
a
ganglion
a
motor
impulse
is
sent
forth
and
the
eyelid
closes
the
same
result
ensues
if
an
object
approaches
the
eye
but
without
actually
entering
it
in
either
case
the
person
is
not
conscious
of
the
sensation
and
motor
impulse
until
the
latter
has
been
accomplished
this
is
reflex
action
the
instinctive
movement
of
the
tickled
foot
is
another
instance
the
jerking
away
of
the
hand
burnt
by
the
lighted
end
of
the
cigar
or
pricked
by
the
point
of
the
pin
is
another
instance
the
involuntary
activities
and
those
known
as
unconscious
activities
result
from
reflex
action
more
than
this
it
is
a
fact
that
many
activities
originally
voluntary
become
what
is
known
as
acquired
reflexes
or
motor
habits
by
means
of
certain
nervous
centers
acquiring
the
habit
of
sending
forth
certain
motor
impulses
in
response
to
certain
sensory
reports
the
familiar
movements
of
our
lives
are
largely
performed
in
this
way
as
for
instance
walking
using
knife
and
fork
operating
typewriters
machines
of
all
kinds
writing
etc
the
squirming
of
a
decapitated
snake
the
muscular
movements
of
a
decapitated
frog
and
the
violent
struggles
fluttering
and
leaps
of
the
decapitated
fowl
are
instances
of
reflex
action
medical
reports
indicate
that
in
cases
of
decapitation
even
man
may
manifest
similar
reflex
action
in
some
cases
thus
we
may
see
that
we
may
and
by
means
of
our
little
brains
as
well
as
by
the
central
brain
or
brains
whatever
mind
may
be
it
is
certain
that
in
these
processes
it
employs
other
portions
of
the
nervous
system
than
the
central
brain
the
three
brains
what
is
known
as
the
brain
of
man
is
really
a
trinity
of
three
brains
known
respectively
as
the
the
and
the
if
one
wishes
to
limit
the
mental
activity
to
conscious
intellectual
effort
then
and
then
only
is
he
correct
in
considering
the
cerebrum
or
large
brain
as
the
brain
medulla
the
medulla
oblongata
is
an
enlargement
of
the
spinal
cord
at
the
base
of
the
brain
its
office
is
that
of
controlling
the
involuntary
activities
of
the
body
such
as
respiration
circulation
assimilation
etc
in
a
broad
sense
its
activities
may
be
said
to
be
of
the
nature
of
highly
developed
and
complex
reflex
activities
it
manifests
chiefly
through
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
which
controls
the
vital
functions
it
does
not
need
to
call
on
the
large
brain
in
these
matters
ordinarily
and
is
able
to
perform
its
tasks
without
the
plane
of
ordinary
consciousness
the
cerebellum
also
known
as
the
little
brain
lies
just
above
the
medulla
oblongata
and
just
below
the
rear
portion
of
the
cerebrum
or
great
brain
it
combines
the
nature
of
a
purely
reflex
center
on
the
one
hand
with
that
of
habit
mind
on
the
other
in
short
it
fills
a
place
between
the
activities
of
the
cerebrum
and
the
medulla
oblongata
having
some
of
the
characteristics
of
each
it
is
the
organ
of
a
number
of
important
acquired
reflexes
such
as
walking
and
many
other
familiar
muscular
movements
which
have
first
been
consciously
acquired
and
then
become
habitual
the
skilled
skater
bicyclist
typist
or
machinist
depends
upon
the
cerebellum
for
the
ease
and
certainty
with
which
he
performs
his
movements
without
thinking
of
them
one
may
be
said
never
to
have
thoroughly
acquired
a
set
of
muscular
movements
such
as
we
have
mentioned
until
the
cerebellum
has
taken
over
the
task
and
relieved
the
cerebrum
of
the
conscious
effort
one
technique
is
never
perfected
until
the
cerebellum
assumes
control
and
direction
of
the
necessary
movements
and
the
impulses
are
sent
forth
from
below
the
plane
of
ordinary
consciousness
the
cerebrum
or
great
brain
which
is
regarded
as
the
brain
by
the
average
person
is
situated
in
the
upper
portion
of
the
skull
and
occupies
by
far
the
larger
portion
of
the
cavity
of
the
skull
it
is
divided
into
two
great
divisions
or
hemispheres
the
best
of
the
modern
authorities
are
agreed
that
the
cerebrum
has
zones
or
areas
of
specialized
functioning
some
of
which
receive
the
sensory
reports
of
the
nerves
and
organs
of
sense
while
others
send
forth
the
motor
impulses
which
result
in
voluntary
physical
action
many
of
these
areas
or
zones
have
been
located
by
science
while
others
remain
as
yet
unlocated
the
probability
is
that
in
time
science
will
succeed
in
correctly
locating
the
area
or
zone
of
each
and
every
class
of
sensation
and
motor
impulse
the
cortex
the
area
of
thought
memory
and
imagination
has
not
been
clearly
located
except
that
these
mental
states
are
believed
to
have
their
seat
in
the
or
outer
thin
rind
of
gray
brain
matter
which
envelopes
and
covers
the
mass
of
brain
substance
it
is
moreover
considered
probable
that
the
higher
processes
of
reasoning
are
performed
in
or
by
the
cortex
of
the
frontal
lobes
the
cortex
of
a
person
of
average
intelligence
if
spread
out
on
a
flat
surface
measures
about
four
square
feet
the
higher
the
degree
of
intelligence
possessed
by
a
lower
animal
or
human
being
as
a
rule
the
deeper
and
more
numerous
are
the
folds
or
convolutions
of
the
cortex
and
the
finer
its
structure
it
may
be
stated
as
a
general
rule
with
but
very
few
exceptions
that
the
higher
the
degree
of
intelligence
in
a
lower
animal
or
human
being
the
greater
is
the
area
of
its
cortex
in
proportion
to
the
size
of
the

the
cortex
it
must
be
remembered
is
folded
into
deep
furrows
or
convolutions
the

resembling
the
inner
portion
of
an
english
walnut
the
interior
of
the
two
hemispheres
of
the
cerebrum
is
composed
largely
of
connective
nerves
which
doubtless
serve
to
produce
and
maintain
the
unity
of
function
of
the
mental
processes
while
physiological
psychology
has
performed
great
work
in
discovering
and
explaining
much
of
the
mechanism
of
mental
processes
it
has
but
touched
the
most
elementary
and
simple
of
the
mental
processes
the

have
so
far
defied

iv
consciousness
the
fact
of
consciousness
is
the
great
mystery
of
psychology
it
is
difficult
even
to
define
the
term
although
every
person
of
average
intelligence
understands
what
is
sought
to
be
conveyed
by
it
webster
defines
it
as
knowledge
of

etc
immediate

or
perception
of
any
object

or

the

or
mental
state
of

definition
is
that
indefinable
characteristic
of
mental
states
which
causes
us
to
be
aware
of
them
it
will
be
seen
that
the
idea
of
awareness
is
the
essence
of
the
idea
of
consciousness
but
at
the
last
we
are
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
it
is
impossible
to
closely
define
consciousness
for
it
is
something
so
entirely
unique
and
different
from
anything
else
that
we
have
no
other
terms
at
all
synonymous
to
it
we
can
define
it
only
in
its
own
terms
as
will
be
seen
by
reference
to
the
definitions
above
given
and
it
is
equally
impossible
to
clearly
account
for
its
appearance
and
being
huxley
has
well
said
how
it
is
that
anything
so
remarkable
as
a
state
of
consciousness
comes
about
by
the
result
of
irritating
nervous
tissue
is
just
as
unaccountable
as
the
appearance
of
the
jinnee
when
aladdin
rubbed
his
lamp
all
that
we
can
ever
know
regarding
the
nature
of
consciousness
must
be
learned
from
turning
the
consciousness
in
ourselves
back
upon
itself
by
focusing
consciousness
upon
its
own
mental
operations
by
means
of
introspection
by
turning
inward
the
conscious
gaze
we
may
perceive
the
flow
of
the
stream
of
thought
from
its
rise
from
the
subconscious
regions
of
the
mind
to
its
final
disappearance
in
the
same
region
it
is
a
common
error
to
suppose
that
we
are
directly
conscious
of
objects
outside
of
ourselves
this
is
impossible
for
there
is
no
direct
knowledge
of
such
outside
objects
we
are
conscious
merely
of
our
sensations
of
or
mental
images
of
the
outside
objects
all
that
it
is
possible
for
us
to
be
directly
conscious
of
are
our
own
mental
experiences
or
states
we
can
not
be
directly
conscious
of
anything
outside
of
our
own
minds
we
are
not
directly
conscious
of
the
tree
which
we
we
are
directly
conscious
merely
of
the
sensation
of
the
nerves
arising
from
the
impact
of
the
light
waves
carrying
the
image
of
the
tree
we
are
not
directly
conscious
of
the
tree
when
we
touch
it
and
perceive
its
character
in
that
way
we
are
directly
conscious
merely
of
the
sensation
reported
by
the
nerves
in
the
finger
tips
which
have
come
in
contact
with
the
tree
we
are
directly
conscious
even
of
our
own
bodies
only
in
the

way
it
is
necessary
for
the

to
experience
that
of
which
it
may
become
conscious
we
are
conscious
only
of
that
which
our
mind
is
experiencing
at
this
moment
or
that
which
it
has
experienced
in
the
past
and
which

by
the
process
of
the

which

subconscious
planes
but
it
must
not
be
thought
that
every
mental
state
or
mental
fact
is
in
the
field
of
consciousness
this
error
has
been
exploded
for
many
years
the
fact
is
now
recognized
that
the
field
of
consciousness
is
a
very
narrow
and
limited
one
and
that
the
great
field
of
mental
activity
lies
outside
of
its
narrow
limits
beyond
and
outside
of
the
narrow
field
of
consciousness
lies
the
great
subconscious
storehouse
of
memory
in
which
are
stored
the
experiences
of
the
past
to
be
drawn
again
into
the
field
of
consciousness
by
an
effort
of
the
will
in
the
act
of
recollection
or
by
association
in
ordinary
remembrance
in
that
great
region
also
the

manifests
many
of
its
activities
and
performs
much
of
its
work
in
that
great
region
are
evolved
the
emotions
and
feelings
which
play
such
an
important
part
in
our
lives
and
which
often
manifest
a
vague
disturbing
unrest
long
before
they
rise
to
the
plane
of
consciousness
in
that
great
region
are
produced
the
ideas
feelings
and
conceptions
which
arise
to
the
plane
of
consciousness
and
manifest
that
which
men
call
genius
on
the
subconscious
plane
the
imagination
does
much
of
its
work
and
startles
its
owner
by
presenting
him
with
the
accomplished
result
in
the

in
the
subconscious
field
is
performed
that
peculiar
process
of
mental
mastication

and
assimilation
with
which
all
brain
workers
are
familiar
and
which
absorbs
the
raw
mental
material
given
it
separates
digests
and
assimilates
it
and
it
to
the
conscious
faculties
sometime
after
as
a
transformed
substance
it
has
been
estimated
that
at
least
per
cent
of
our
mental
activities
are
performed
below
or
outside
of
the
field
of
consciousness
the
psychology
of
is
paying
much
attention
to
this
formerly
neglected
great
area
or
areas
of
the
mind
the
psychology
of
will
pay
still
greater
attention
to
it
the
best
of
the
modern
authorities
agree
that
in
the
great
field
of
subconscious
mentation
is
to
be
found
the
explanation
of
much
that
is
unexplainable
otherwise
in
fact
it
is
probable
that
before
long
consciousness
will
be
regarded
as
a
mere
of
upon
mental
states
and
the
objects
of
consciousness
merely
as
that
portion
of
the
contents
of
the
mind
in
the
field
of
mental
vision
created
by
such
focusing
chapter
attention
intimately
connected
with
the
object
of
consciousness
is
that
process
of
the
mind
which
we
call
attention
attention
is
generally
defined
as
the
application
of
the
mind
to
a
mental
state
it
is
often
referred
to
as
concentrated
consciousness
but
others
have
ventured
the
somewhat
daring
conjecture
that
consciousness
itself
is
rather
the
result
of
attention
instead
of
the
latter
being
an
incident
of
consciousness
we
shall
not
attempt
to
discuss
this
question
here
except
to
state
that
consciousness
depends
very
materially
upon
the
degree
of
attention
bestowed
upon
its
object
the
authorities
place
great
importance
upon
the
intelligent
direction
of
the
attention
and
hold
that
without
this
the
higher
forms
of
knowledge
are
impossible
it
is
the
common
belief
that
we
feel
see
hear
taste
or
smell
whenever
objects
affecting
those
senses
come
in
contact
with
the
organs
of
sense
governing
them
but
this
is
only
a
partial
truth
the
real
truth
is
that
we
become
conscious
of
the
report
of
these
senses
only
when
the
attention
is
directed
toward
the
sensation
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
that
is
to
say
that
in
many
cases
although
the
sense
nerves
and
organs
report
a
disturbance
the
mind
does
not
become
consciously
aware
of
the
report
unless
the
attention
is
directed
toward
it
either
by
an
act
of
will
or
else
by
reflex
action
for
instance
the
clock
may
strike
loudly
and
yet
we
may
not
be
conscious
of
the
fact
for
we
are
concentrating
our
attention
upon
a
book
or
we
may
eat
the
choicest
food
without
tasting
it
for
we
are
listening
intently
to
the
conversation
of
our
charming
neighbor
we
may
fail
to
perceive
some
startling
occurrence
happening
under
our
very
eyes
for
we
are
buried
in
deep
thought
concerning
something
far
removed
from
the
present
scene
there
are
many
cases
on
record
showing
that
one
may
be
so
interested
in
speaking
thinking
or
acting
that
he
will
not
experience
pain
that
would
otherwise
be
intolerable
writers
have
forgotten
their
pain
in
the
concentrated
interest
bestowed
upon
their
work
mothers
have
failed
to
feel
pain
when
their
infants
required
urgent
attention
orators
have
been
so
carried
away
by
their
own
eloquence
that
they
have
failed
to
feel
the
pricking
of
the
pin
by
means
of
which
their
friends
have
sought
to
attract
their
attention
not
only
perception
and
feeling
depend
largely
upon
attention
but
the
processes
of
reasoning
memory
and
even
of
will
depend
upon
attention
for
much
of
their
manifestation
psychologists
divide
attention
into
two
general
classes
viz
voluntary
attention
and
involuntary
attention
voluntary
attention
is
attention
directed
by
the
will
to
some
object
of
our
own
more
or
less
deliberate
selection
it
requires
a
distinct
effort
of
the
will
in
order
to
focus
the
attention
in
this
way
and
many
persons
are
scarcely
aware
of
its
existence
so
seldom
do
they
manifest
it
voluntary
attention
is
the
result
of
training
and
practice
and
marks
the
man
of
strong
will
concentration
and
character
some
authorities
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
much
of
that
which
is
commonly
called
will
power
is
really
but
a
developed
form
of
voluntary
attention
the
man
of
strong
will
holding
before
him
the
one
idea
which
he
wishes
to
realize
involuntary
attention
often
called
reflex
attention
is
attention
called
forth
by
a
nervous
response
to
some
sense
stimulus
this
is
the
common
form
of
attention
and
is
but
the
same
form
which
is
so
strongly
manifested
by
children
whose
attention
is
caught
by
every
new
object
but
which
can
not
be
held
for
any
length
of
time
by
a
familiar
or
uninteresting
one
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
one
should
cultivate
his
power
of
voluntary
attention
not
only
is
the
will
power
strengthened
and
developed
in
this
way
but
every
mental
faculty
is
developed
by
reason
thereof
the
training
of
the
voluntary
attention
is
the
first
step
in
mental
development
training
the
attention
that
the
voluntary
attention
may
be
deliberately
trained
and
developed
is
a
fact
which
many
of
the
world
greatest
men
have
proved
for
themselves
there
is
only
one
way
to
train
and
develop
any
mental
power
of
faculty
and
that
is
practice
and
by
practice
interest
may
be
given
to
objects
previously
uninteresting
and
thus
the
use
of
the
attention
develops
the
interest
which
further
holds
it
interest
is
the
natural
road
over
which
attention
travels
easily
but
interest
itself
may
be
induced
by
concentrated
attention
by
studying
and
examining
an
object
the
attention
brings
to
light
many
new
and
novel
features
regarding
the
thing
and
these
produce
a
new
interest
which
in
turn
attracts
further
and
continued
attention
there
is
no
royal
road
to
the
development
of
voluntary
attention
the
only
true
method
is
you
must
practice
on
uninteresting
things
the
primary
interest
being
your
desire
to
develop
the
power
of
voluntary
attention
but
as
you
begin
to
attend
to
the
uninteresting
thing
you
will
become
interested
in
the
task
for
its
own
sake
take
some
object
and
place
your
mind
upon
it
think
of
its
nature
where
it
came
from
its
use
its
associations
its
probable
future
of
things
related
to
it
etc
keep
the
attention
firmly
upon
it
and
shut
out
all
outside
ideas
then
after
a
little
practice
of
this
kind
lay
aside
the
object
for
the
time
being
and
take
it
up
again
the
next
day
endeavoring
to
discover
new
points
of
interest
in
it
the
main
thing
to
be
sought
is
hold
the
thing
in
your
and
this
can
be
done
only
by
features
of
interest
in
the
attention
may
rebel
at
this
task
at
first
and
will
seek
to
wander
from
the
path
into
the
green
pastures
which
are
found
on
each
side
thereof
but
you
must
bring
the
mind
back
to
the
task
again
and
again
after
a
time
the
mind
will
become
accustomed
to
the
drill
and
will
even
begin
to
enjoy
it
give
it
some
variety
by
occasionally
changing
the
objects
of
examination
the
object
need
not
always
be
something
to
be
looked
at
instead
select
some
subject
in
history
or
literature
and
run
it
down
endeavoring
to
bring
to
light
all
the
facts
relating
to
it
that
are
possible
to
you
may
be
used
as
the
subject
or
object
of
your
inquiry
but
what
is
chosen
must
be
held
in
the
field
of
conscious
attention
firmly
and
fixedly
the
habit
once
acquired
you
will
find
the
practice
most
fascinating
you
will
invent
new
subjects
or
objects
of
inquiry
investigation
and
thought
which
in
themselves
will
well
repay
you
for
your
work
and
time
but
never
lose
sight
of
the
main
point
the
development
of
the
power
of
voluntary
attention
in
studying
the
methods
of
developing
and
training
the
voluntary
attention
the
student
should
remember
that
exercise
which
develops
the
will
will
result
in
developing
the
attention
and
likewise
any
exercise
which
develops
the
voluntary
attention
will
tend
to
strengthen
the
will
the
will
and
attention
are
so
closely
bound
together
that
what
affects
one
also
influences
the
other
this
fact
should
be
borne
in
mind
and
the
exercises
and
practices
based
upon
it
in
practicing
concentration
of
voluntary
attention
it
should
be
remembered
that
concentrating
consists
not
only
of
the
attention
upon
a
given
object
or
subject
but
also
of
the
of
impressions
from
other
objects
or
subjects
some
authorities
advise
that
the
student
endeavor
to
listen
to
one
voice
among
many
or
one
instrument
among
the
many
of
a
band
or
orchestra
others
advise
the
practice
of
concentrating
on
the
reading
of
a
book
in
a
room
filled
by
persons
engaged
in
conversation
and
similar
exercises
whatever
aids
in
the
of
attention
at
a
given
moment
tends
to
develop
the
power
of
voluntary
attention
the
study
of
mathematics
and
logic
is
also
held
to
be
an
excellent
practice
in
concentration
of
voluntary
attention
inasmuch
as
these
studies
require
close
concentration
and
attention
attention
is
also
developed
by
any
study
or
practice
which
demands
of
a
whole
into
its
parts
and
then
the
or
building
up
of
a
whole
from
its
scattered
parts
each
of
the
senses
should
play
a
part
in
the
exercises
and
in
addition
to
this
the
mind
should
be
trained
to
concentrate
upon
some
one
idea
held
within
itself
some
mental
image
or
abstract
idea
existing
independently
of
any
object
of
immediate
sense

mistake
that

everything

by
the

of

we

a

it

great

in

while
we
may

that

but
while
this

the

then
while
the

the
formation
of

consists
of
three
gradual
stages
viz
the

forms
definite
conscious
sensations
from
indefinite
nervous
reports
the

interprets
these
definite
conscious
sensations

attributes
them
to

the
related
sensations
are
grouped
together
their
unity
perceived
and
they
are
regarded
as
qualities
of
the
outside
object
the
plain
distinction
between
a
sensation
and
a
percept
may
be
fixed
in
the
mind
by
remembering
the
following
sensation
is
a
percept
is
a
simple
thought
identifying
one
or
more
a
sensation
is
merely
the
conscious
recognition
of
an
excitation
of
a
nerve
end
a
percept
results
from
a
distinct
mental
process
regarding
the

developing

it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
we
develop
and
train
our
powers
of

perceptive
power

matters
it

if
we
do
not

material
of
our
mental
world
many
persons
go
through
the
world
without
perceiving
even
the
most
obvious
facts
their
eyes
and
ears
are
perfect
instruments
their
nerves
convey
accurate
reports
but
the
perceptive
faculties
of
the
mind
fail
to
observe

interpret
the
report
of
the

distinctly

the
reports
of

are

knowledge
largely

than
the

to

tends
in

cases
to
weaken

perception
may
be
developed
by
practice
begin
by
taking
notice
of
the
things
seen
and
heard
in
your
usual

keep
wide
open
the
eyes
of
the
mind
notice
the

of

their

their

look
for
interesting
and
odd
things
and
you
will
see
them
do
not
go
through
life
in
a
daydream
but
keep
a
sharp
lookout
for
things
of
interest
and
value
the
most
familiar
things
will
repay
you
for
the
time
and
work
of
examining
them
in
detail
and
the
practice
gained
by
such
tasks
will
prove
valuable
in
your
development
of
perception

page
at

any
study

if
we
will
analyze
the

we
see
resolving

we
will
likewise
develop

to
discover

noting

the

those

to
systematically
practice
exercises
of
this
kind
report

notice
a

improvement
from

even

begin

likewise
interest
may
be
created
in

by
observing

the

gained
by

is
that
resulting

about

in

which
is
lacking

which
he
merely
because

heard
it
one
can
make
such
knowledge
a
part
of
himself
not
only
is
one
knowledge
dependent
upon
what
he
perceives
but
his
very
character
also
results
from
the
character
of
his

the

is
great

perceived
about

it

not
so

what
lies

gets
of
one
by

by
directing
his

to
desirable
objects
and
perceiving
as
much
of

as
is

one
really
builds

the

needs
good
perceivers
in

it
finds
a

of
them
and
is
demanding
them

the

who
can

observe
the

of
any
profession
business

will
go

of
representing
in
consciousness
what
is
thus
evoked
memory
is
the
primary
representative
faculty
or
power
of
the
mind
imagination
depends
upon
memory
for
its
material
as
we
shall
see
when
we
consider
that
faculty
every
mental
process
which
involves
the
remembrance
recollection
or
representation
of
a
sensation
perception
mental
image
thought
or
idea
previously
experienced
must
depend
upon
memory
for
its
material
memory
is
the
great
storehouse
of
the
mind
in
which
are
placed
the
records
of
previous
mental
experiences
it
is
a
part
of
the
great
subconscious
field
of
mental
activity
and
the
greater
part
of
its
work
is
performed
below
the
plane
of
consciousness
it
is
only
when
its
results
are
passed
into
the
field
of
consciousness
that
we
are
aware
of
its
existence
we
know
memory
only
by
its
works
of
its
nature
we
know
but
little
although
certain
of
its
principal
laws
and
principles
have
been
discovered
it
was
formerly
customary
to
class
memory
with
the
various
faculties
of
the
mind
but
later
psychology
no
longer
so
considers
it
memory
is
now
regarded
as
a
power
of
the
general
mind
manifesting
in
connection
with
every
faculty
of
the
mind
it
is
now
regarded
as
belonging
to
the
great
subconscious
field
of
mentation
and
its
explanation
must
be
sought
there
it
is
utterly
unexplainable
otherwise
the
importance
of
memory
can
not
be
overestimated
not
only
does
a
character
and
education
depend
chiefly
upon
it
but
his
very
mental
being
is
bound
up
with
it
if
there
were
no
memory
man
would
never
progress
mentally
beyond
the
mental
state
of
the
newborn
babe
he
would
never
be
able
to
profit
by
experience
he
would
never
be
able
to
form
clear
perceptions
he
would
never
be
able
to
reason
or
form
judgments
the
processes
of
thought
depend
for
material
upon
the
memory
of
past
experiences
this
material
lacking
there
can
be
no
thought
memory
has
two
important
general
functions
viz
the
of
impressions
and
experiences
and
the
of
the
impressions
and
experiences
so
retained
it
was
formerly
held
that
the
memory
retained
only
a
portion
of
the
impressions
and
experiences
originally
noted
by
it
but
the
present
theory
is
that
it
retains
every
impression
and
experience
which
is
noted
by
it
it
is
true
that
many
of
these
impressions
are
never
reproduced
in
consciousness
but
experiments
tend
to
prove
nevertheless
that
the
records
are
still
in
the
memory
and
that
appropriate
and
sufficiently
strong
stimuli
will
bring
them
into
the
field
of
consciousness
the
phenomena
of
somnambulism
dreams
hysteria
delirium
approach
of
death
show
that
the
subconscious
mind
has
an
immense
accumulation
of
apparently
forgotten
facts
which
unusual
stimuli
will
serve
to
recall
the
power
of
the
memory
to
reproduce
the
retained
impressions
and
experiences
is
variously
called
remembrance
recollection
or
memory
this
power
varies
materially
in
various
individuals
but
it
is
an
axiom
of
psychology
that
the
memory
of
any
person
may
be
developed
and
trained
by
practice
the
ability
to
recall
depends
to
a
great
extent
upon
the
clearness
and
depth
of
the
original
impression
which
in
turn
depends
upon
the
degree
of
attention
given
to
it
at
the
time
of
its
occurrence
recollection
is
also
greatly
aided
by
the
law
of
association
or
the
principle
whereby
one
mental
fact
is
linked
to
another
the
more
facts
to
which
a
given
fact
is
linked
the
greater
the
ease
by
which
it
is
recalled
or
remembered
recollection
is
also
greatly
assisted
by
use
and
exercise
like
the
fingers
the
memory
cells
of
the
brain
become
expert
and
efficient
by
use
and
exercise
or
stiff
and
inefficient
by
lack
of
the
same
in
addition
to
the
phases
of
retention
and
reproduction
there
are
two
important
phases
of
memory
viz
recognition
of
the
reproduced
impression
or
experience
and
localization
of
the
impression
or
its
reference
to
a
more
or
less
definite
time
and
place
the
recognition
of
the
recalled
impression
is
quite
important
it
is
not
enough
that
the
impression
be
retained
and
recalled
if
we
are
not
able
to
recognize
the
recalled
impression
as
having
been
experienced
before
the
recollection
will
be
of
but
little
use
to
us
in
our
thought
processes
the
purposes
of
thought
demand
that
we
shall
be
able
to
identify
the
recalled
impression
with
the
original
one
recognition
is
really
recognition
is
akin
to
perception
the
mind
becomes
conscious
of
the
recalled
impression
just
as
it
becomes
conscious
of
the
sensation
it
then
recognizes
the
relation
of
the
recalled
impression
to
the
original
one
just
as
it
realizes
the
relation
of
the
sensation
to
its
object
the
localization
of
the
recalled
and
recognized
impression
is
also
important
even
if
we
recognize
the
recalled
impression
it
will
be
of
comparatively
little
use
to
us
unless
we
are
able
to
locate
it
as
having
happened
yesterday
last
week
last
month
last
year
ten
years
ago
or
at
some
time
in
the
past
and
as
having
happened
in
our
office
house
or
in
a
place
in
the
street
or
in
some
distant
place
without
the
power
of
localization
we
should
be
unable
to
connect
and
associate
the
remembered
fact
with
the
time
place
and
persons
with
which
it
should
be
placed
to
be
of
use
and
value
to
us
in
our
thought
processes
retention
the
retention
of
a
mental
impression
in
the
memory
depends
very
materially
upon
the
clearness
and
depth
of
the
original
impression
and
this
clearness
and
depth
as
we
have
previously
stated
depend
upon
the
degree
of
attention
bestowed
upon
the
original
impression
attention
then
is
the
important
factor
in
the
forming
and
recording
of
impressions
the
rule
is
attention
faint
attention
clear
and
deep
to
fix
this
fact
in
the
mind
the
student
may
think
of
the
retentive
and
reproductive
phases
of
memory
as
a
phonographic
record
the
receiving
diaphragm
of
the
phonograph
represents
the
sense
organs
and
the
recording
needle
represents
the
the
needle
makes
the
record
on
the
cylinder
deep
or
faint
according
to
the
condition
of
the
needle
a
loud
sound
may
be
recorded
but
faintly
if
the
needle
is
not
properly
adjusted
and
further
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
strength
of
the
reproduction
depends
almost
entirely
upon
the
clearness
and
depth
of
the
original
impression
on
the
cylinder
as
is
the
record
so
is
the
reproduction
it
will
be
well
for
the
student
to
carry
this
symbol
of
the
phonograph
in
his
mind
it
will
aid
him
in
developing
his
powers
of
memory
in
this
connection
we
should
remember
that
attention
depends
largely
upon
interest
therefore
we
would
naturally
expect
to
find
that
we
remember
interesting
things
far
more
readily
than
those
which
lack
interest
this
supposition
is
borne
out
in
actual
experience
this
accounts
for
the
fact
that
every
one
remembers
a
certain
class
of
things
better
than
he
does
others
one
remembers
faces
another
dates
another
spoken
conversation
another
written
words
and
so
on
it
will
be
found
as
a
rule
that
each
person
is
interested
in
the
class
of
things
which
he
most
easily
remembers
the
artist
easily
remembers
faces
and
details
of
faces
or
scenery
and
details
thereof
the
musician
easily
recalls
passages
or
bars
of
music
often
of
a
most
complicated
nature
the
speculator
easily
recalls
the
quotations
of
his
favorite
stocks
the
racing
man
recalls
without
difficulty
the
odds
posted
on
a
certain
horse
on
a
certain
day
or
the
details
of
a
race
which
was
run
many
years
ago
the
moral
is
and
induce
an
interest
in
the
things
which
you
wish
to
this
interest
may
be
aroused
by
studying
the
things
in
question
as
we
have
suggested
in
a
preceding
chapter
visualization
in
memory
many
of
the
best
authorities
hold
that
original
impressions
may
be
made
clear
and
deep
and
the
process
of
reproduction
accordingly
rendered
more
efficient
by
the
practice
of
the
thing
to
be
remembered
by
visualizing
is
meant
the
formation
of
a
of
the
thing
in
the
imagination
if
you
wish
to
remember
the
appearance
of
anything
look
at
it
closely
with
attention
and
then
turning
away
from
it
endeavor
to
reproduce
its
appearance
as
a
mental
picture
in
the
mind
if
this
is
done
a
particularly
clear
impression
will
be
made
in
the
memory
and
when
you
recall
the
thing
you
will
find
that
you
will
also
recall
the
clear
mental
image
of
it
of
course
the
greater
the
number
of
details
observed
and
included
in
the
original
mental
image
the
greater
the
remembered
detail
perception
in
memory
not
only
is
attention
necessary
in
forming
clear
memory
records
but
careful
perception
is
also
important
without
clear
perception
there
is
a
lack
of
detail
in
the
retained
record
and
the
element
of
association
is
lacking
it
is
not
enough
to
merely
remember
the
thing
itself
we
should
also
remember
it
is
and
all
about
it
the
practice
of
the
methods
of
developing
perception
given
in
a
preceding
lesson
will
tend
to
develop
and
train
the
retentive
reproductive
recognitive
and
locative
powers
of
the
memory
the
rule
is
greater
the
degree
of
perception
accorded
a
thing
the
greater
the
detail
of
the
retained
impression
and
the
greater
the
ease
of
the
understanding
and
memory
another
important
point
in
acquiring
impressions
in
memory
is
this
the
better
the
understanding
of
the
subject
or
object
the
clearer
the
impressions
regarding
it
and
the
clearer
the
recollection
of
this
fact
is
proved
by
experiment
and
experience
a
subject
which
will
be
remembered
only
with
difficulty
under
ordinary
circumstances
will
be
easily
remembered
if
it
is
fully
explained
to
the
person
and
accompanied
by
a
few
familiar
illustrations
or
examples
it
is
very
difficult
to
remember
a
meaningless
string
of
words
while
a
sentence
which
conveys
a
clear
meaning
may
be
memorized
easily
if
we
understand
a
thing
is
its
uses
and
employment
we
remember
it
far
more
easily
than
if
we
lack
this
understanding
elbringhaus
who
conducted
a
number
of
experiments
along
this
line
reports
that
he
could
memorize
a
stanza
of
poetry
in
about
one
tenth
the
time
required
to
memorize
the
same
amount
of
nonsense
syllables
gordy
states
that
he
once
asked
a
capable
student
of
the
johns
hopkins
university
to
give
him
an
account
of
a
lecture
to
which
he
had
just
listened
i
can
not
do
it
replied
the
student
it
was
not
logical
the
rule
is
more
one
knows
about
a
certain
thing
the
more
easily
is
that
thing
this
is
a
point
worth
noting
chapter
viii
memory
continued
the
subject
of
memory
can
not
be
touched
upon
intelligently
without
a
consideration
of
the
law
of
association
one
of
the
important
psychological
principles
the
law
of
association
what
is
known
in
psychology
as
the
law
of
association
is
based
on
the
fact
that
idea
exists
in
the
mind
except
in
association
with
other
this
is
not
generally
recognized
and
the
majority
of
persons
will
dispute
the
law
at
first
thought
but
the
existence
and
appearance
of
ideas
in
the
mind
are
governed
by
a
mental
law
as
invariable
and
constant
as
the
physical
law
of
gravitation
every
idea
has
associations
with
other
ideas
ideas
travel
in
groups
and
one
group
is
associated
with
another
group
and
so
on
until
in
the
end
every
idea
in
one
mind
is
associated
directly
or
indirectly
with
every
other
idea
theoretically
at
least
it
would
be
possible
to
begin
with
one
idea
in
the
mind
of
a
person
and
then
gradually
unwind
his
entire
stock
of
ideas
like
the
yarn
on
the
ball
our
thoughts
proceed
according
to
this
law
we
sit
down
in
a
brown
study
and
proceed
from
one
subject
to
another
until
we
are
unable
to
remember
any
connection
between
the
first
thought
and
the
last
but
each
step
of
the
reverie
was
connected
with
the
one
preceding
and
the
one
succeeding
it
it
is
interesting
to
trace
back
these
connections
poe
based
one
of
his
celebrated
detective
stories
on
this
law
the
reverie
may
be
broken
into
by
a
sudden
impression
from
outside
and
we
will
then
proceed
from
that
impression
connecting
it
with
something
else
already
in
our
experience
and
starting
a
new
chain
of
sequence
often
we
fail
to
trace
the
associations
governing
our
ideas
but
the
chain
is
there
nevertheless
one
may
think
of
a
past
scene
or
experience
without
any
apparent
cause
a
little
thought
will
show
that
something
seen
or
a
few
notes
of
a
song
floating
to
the
ears
or
the
fragrance
of
a
flower
has
supplied
the
connecting
link
between
the
past
and
the
present
a
suggestion
of
mignonette
will
recall
some
past
event
in
which
the
perfume
played
a
part
some
one
handkerchief
perhaps
carried
the
same
odor
or
an
old
familiar
tune
reminds
one
of
some
one
something
or
some
place
in
the
past
a
familiar
feature
in
the
countenance
of
a
will
start
one
thinking
of
some
one
else
who
had
that
kind
of
a
mouth
that
shaped
nose
or
that
expression
of
the
eye
and
away
he
will
be
off
in
a
sequence
of
remembered
experiences
often
the
starting
idea
or
the
connecting
links
may
appear
but
dimly
in
consciousness
but
rest
assured
they
are
always
there
in
fact
we
frequently
accept
this
law
unconsciously
and
without
realizing
its
actual
existence
for
instance
one
makes
a
remark
and
at
once
we
wonder
how
did
he
come
to
think
of
that
and
if
we
are
shrewd
we
may
discover
what
was
in
his
mind
before
he
spoke
there
are
two
general
classes
of
association
of
ideas
in
memory
viz
association
of
contiguity
and
logical
association
association
of
contiguity
is
that
form
of
association
depending
upon
the
previous
association
in
time
or
space
of
ideas
which
have
been
impressed
on
the
mind
for
instance
if
you
met
and
wetterhorn
and
were
introduced
to
them
one
after
the
other
thereafter
you
will
naturally
remember
when
you
think
of
and
vice
versa
you
will
naturally
remember
napoleon
when
you
think
of
wellington
or
benedict
arnold
when
you
think
of
major
andrÃ©
for
the
same
reason
you
will
also
naturally
remember
and
when
you
think
of
likewise
you
will
think
of
abstract
time
when
you
think
of
abstract
space
of
thunder
when
you
think
of
lightning
of
colic
when
you
recall
green
apples
of
love
making
and
moonlight
nights
when
you
think
of
college
days
in
the
same
way
we
remember
things
which
occurred
just
before
or
just
after
the
event
in
our
mind
at
the
moment
of
things
near
in
space
to
the
thing
of
which
we
are
thinking
logical
association
depends
upon
the
relation
of
likeness
or
difference
between
several
things
thought
of
things
thus
associated
may
have
never
come
into
the
mind
at
the
same
previous
time
nor
are
they
necessarily
connected
in
time
and
space
one
may
think
of
a
book
and
then
proceed
by
association
to
think
of
another
book
by
the
same
author
or
of
another
author
treating
of
the
same
subject
or
he
may
think
of
a
book
directly
opposed
to
the
first
the
relation
of
distinct
difference
causing
the
associated
idea
logical
association
depends
upon
and
not
upon
the
outer
relations
of
time
and
space
this
of
relation
between
things
not
connected
in
space
or
time
is
discovered
only
by
experience
and
education
the
educated
man
realizes
many
points
of
relationship
between
things
that
are
thought
by
the
uneducated
man
to
be
totally
unrelated
wisdom
and
knowledge
consist
largely
in
the
recognition
of
relations
between
things
association
in
memory
it
follows
from
a
consideration
of
the
law
of
association
that
when
one
wishes
to
impress
a
thing
upon
the
memory
he
should
as
an
authority
says
multiply
associations
entangle
the
fact
you
wish
to
remember
in
a
net
of
as
many
associations
as
possible
especially
those
that
are
logical
hence
the
advice
to
place
your
facts
in
groups
and
classes
in
the
memory
as
blackie
says
nothing
helps
the
mind
so
much
as
order
and
classification
classes
are
always
few
individuals
many
to
know
the
class
well
is
to
know
what
is
most
essential
in
the
character
of
the
individual
and
what
burdens
the
memory
least
to
retain
repetition
in
memory
another
important
principle
of
memory
is
that
the
impressions
acquire
depth
and
clearness
by
repetition
repeat
a
line
of
poetry
once
and
you
may

bestow

cultivate

cultivate

and
then
unwind
your

ball
of
yarn
when
you
recall
an
impression
send
it
back
with
energy
to
deepen
the
impression
and
attach
it
to
as
many
new
associations
as
possible
practice
a
little
memorizing
and
recalling

if
only
a

verse
the
memory
improves
by
practice
and
deteriorates
by
neglect
and
disuse
demand
good
service
of
your
memory
and
it
will
learn
to
respond
learn
to
trust
it
and
it
will
rise
to
the
occasion
how
can
you
expect
your
memory
to
give
good
service
when
you
continually
abuse
it
and
tell
every
one
of
the
wretched
memory
i
have
i
can
never
remember
anything
your
memory
is
very
apt
to
accept
your
statements
as
truth
our
mental
faculties
have
an
annoying
habit
of
taking
us
at
our
word
in
these
matters
tell
your
memory
what
you
expect
it
to
do
then
trust
it
and
refrain
from
abusing
it
and
giving
it
a
bad
name
final
advice
finally
remember
this
rule
you
get
out
of
your
memory
only
that
which
you
place
in
it
place
in
it
good
clear
deep
impressions
and
it
will
reproduce
good
clear
strong
recollections
think
of
your
memory
as
a
phonographic
record
and
take
care
that
you
place
the
right
kind
of
impressions
upon
it
in
memory
you
reap
that
which
you
have
sown
you
must
give
to
the
memory
before
you
can
receive
from
it
of
one
thing
you
may
rest
assured
namely
that
unless
you
take
sufficient
interest
in
the
things
to
be
remembered
you
will
find
that
the
memory
will
not
take
sufficient
interest
in
them
to
remember
them
memory
demands
interest
before
it
will
take
interest
in
the
task
it
demands
attention
before
it
will
give
attention
it
demands
understanding
before
it
will
give
understanding
it
demands
association
before
it
will
respond
to
association
it
demands
repetition
before
it
will
repeat
the
memory
is
a
splendid
instrument
but
it
stands
on
its
dignity
and
asserts
its
rights
it
belongs
to
the
old
dispensation
it
demands
compensation
and
believes
in
giving
only
in
equal
measure
to
what
it
receives
our
advice
is
to
get
acquainted
with
your
memory
and
make
friends
with
it
treat
it
well
and
it
will
serve
you
well
but
neglect
it
and
it
will
turn
its
back
on
you
chapter
ix
imagination
the
imagination
belongs
to
the
general
class
of
mental
processes
called
the
representative
faculties
by
which
is
meant
the
processes
in
which
there
are
or
presented
again
to
consciousness
impressions
previously
presented
to
it
as
we
have
indicated
elsewhere
the
imagination
is
dependent
upon
memory
for
its
materials
its
records
of
previous
impressions
but
imagination
is
more
than
mere
memory
or
recollection
of
these
previously
experienced
and
recorded
impressions
there
is
in
addition
to
the
and
recollection
a
process
of
arranging
the
recalled
impressions
into
new
forms
and
new
combinations
the
imagination
not
only
gathers
together
the
old
impressions
but
also
new
combinations
and
forms
from
the
material
so
gathered
psychology
gives
us
many
hairsplitting
definitions
and
distinctions
between
simple
reproductive
imagination
and
memory
but
these
distinctions
are
technical
and
as
a
rule
perplexing
to
the
average
student
in
truth
there
is
very
little
if
any
difference
between
simple
reproductive
imagination
and
memory
although
when
the
imagination
indulges
in
constructive
activity
a
new
feature
enters
into
the
process
which
is
absent
in
pure
memory
operations
in
simple
reproductive
imagination
there
is
simply
the
formation
of
the
mental
image
of
some
previous
experience
the
reproduction
of
a
previous
mental
image
this
differs
very
little
from
memory
except
that
the
recalled
image
is
clearer
and
stronger
in
the
same
way
in
ordinary
memory
in
the
manifestation
of
recollection
there
is
often
the
same
clear
strong
mental
image
that
is
produced
in
reproductive
imagination
the
two
mental
processes
blend
into
each
other
so
closely
that
it
is
practically
impossible
to
draw
the
line
between
them
in
spite
of
the
technical
differences
urged
by
the
psychologists
of
course
the
mere
remembrance
of
a
person
who
presents
himself
to
one
is
nearer
to
pure
memory
than
to
imagination
for
the
process
is
that
of
recognition
but
the
memory
or
remembrance
of
the
same
person
when
he
is
absent
from
sight
is
practically
that
of
reproductive
imagination
memory
in
its
stage
of
recognition
exists
in
the
child
mind
before
reproductive
imagination
is
manifested
the
latter
therefore
is
regarded
as
a
higher
mental
process
but
still
higher
in
the
scale
is
that
which
is
known
as
this
form
of
imagination
appears
at
a
later
period
of
child
mentation
and
is
regarded
as
a
later
evolution
of
mental
processes
of
the
race
gordy
makes
the
following
distinction
between
the
two
phases
of
imagination
the
difference
between
reproductive
imagination
and
constructive
imagination
is
that
the
images
resulting
from
reproductive
imagination
are
of
past
while
those
resulting
from
constructive
imagination
are
not
to
learn
whether
any
particular
image
or
combination
of
images
is
the
product
of
reproductive
or
constructive
imagination
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
learn
whether
or
not
it
is
a
copy
of
a
past
experience
our
memories
of
course
are
defective
and
we
may
be
uncertain
on
that
account
but
apart
from
that
we
need
be
in
no
doubt
whatever
many
persons
hearing
for
the
first
time
the
statement
of
psychologists
that
the
imaginative
faculties
can
and
or
only
the
images
which
have
previously
been
impressed
upon
the
mind
are
apt
to
object
that
they
can
and
frequently
do
image
things
which
they
have
not
previously
experienced
but
can
they
and
do
they
is
it
not
true
that
what
they
believe
to
be
original
creations
of
the
imagination
are
merely
of
original
impressions
for
instance
no
one
ever
saw
a
unicorn
and
yet
some
one
originally
imagined
its
form
but
a
little
thought
will
show
that
the
image
of
the
unicorn
is
merely
that
of
an
animal
having
the
head
neck
and
body
of
a
horse
with
the
beard
of
a
goat
the
legs
of
a
buck
the
tail
of
a
lion
and
a
long
tapering
horn
spirally
twisted
in
the
middle
of
the
forehead
each
of
the
several
parts
of
the
unicorn
exists
in
some
living
animal
although
the
unicorn
composed
of
all
of
these
parts
is
outside
of
fable
in
the
same
way
the
centaur
is
composed
of
the
body
legs
and
tail
of
the
horse
and
the
trunk
head
and
arms
of
a
man
the
satyr
has
the
head
body
and
arms
of
a
man
with
the
horns
legs
and
hoofs
of
a
goat
the
mermaid
has
the
head
arms
and
trunk
of
a
woman
joined
at
the
waist
to
the
body
and
tail
of
a
fish
the
mythological
devil
has
the
head
body
and
arms
of
a
man
with
the
horns
legs
and
cloven
foot
of
the
lower
animal
and
a
peculiar
tail
composed
of
that
of
some
animal
but
tipped
with
a
spearhead
each
of
these
characteristics
is
composed
of
familiar
images
of
experience
the
imagination
may
occupy
itself
for
a
lifetime
turning
out
impossible
animals
of
this
kind
but
every
part
thereof
will
be
found
to
correspond
to
something
existent
in
nature
and
experienced
by
the
mind
of
the
person
creating
the
strange
beast
in
the
same
way
the
imagination
may
picture
a
familiar
person
or
thing
acting
in
an
unaccustomed
manner
the
latter
having
no
basis
in
fact
so
far
as
the
individual
person
or
thing
is
concerned
but
being
warranted
by
some
experience
concerning
other
persons
or
things
for
instance
one
may
easily
form
the
image
of
a
dog
swimming
under
water
like
a
fish
or
climbing
a
tree
like
a
cat
likewise
one
may
form
a
mental
image
of
a
learned
bewigged
high
chancellor
or
a
venerable
archbishop
of
canterbury
dressed
like
a
clown
standing
on
his
head
balancing
a
colored
football
on
his
feet
sticking
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
and
winking
at
the
audience
in
the
same
way
one
may
imagine
a
railroad
running
across
a
barren
desert
or
a
steep
mountain
upon
which
there
is
not
as
yet
a
rail
laid
the
bridge
across
a
river
may
be
imaged
in
the
same
way
in
fact
this
is
the
way
that
everything
is
mentally
created
constructed
or
invented
the
old
materials
being
combined
in
a
new
way
and
arranged
in
a
new
fashion
some
psychologists
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
no
mental
image
of
memory
is
an
exact
reproduction
of
the
original
impression
that
there
are
always
changes
due
to
the
unconscious
operation
of
the
constructive
imagination
the
constructive
imagination
is
able
to
tear
things
to
pieces
in
search
for
material
as
well
as
to
join
things
together
in
its
work
of
building
the
importance
of
the
imagination
in
all
the
processes
of
intellectual
thought
is
great
without
imagination
man
could
not
reason
or
manifest
any
intellectual
process
it
is
impossible
to
consider
the
subject
of
thought
without
first
regarding
the
processes
of
imagination
and
yet
it
is
common
to
hear
persons
speak
of
the
imagination
as
if
it
were
a
faculty
of
mere
fancy
useless
and
without
place
in
the
practical
world
of
thought
developing
the
imagination
the
imagination
is
capable
of
development
and
training
the
general
rules
for
development
of
the
imagination
are
practically
those
which
we
have
stated
in
connection
with
the
development
of
the
memory
there
is
the
same
necessity
for
plenty
of
material
for
the
formation
of
clear
and
deep
impressions
and
mental
images
the
same
necessity
for
repeated
impression
and
the
frequent
use
and
employment
of
the
faculty
the
practice
of
visualization
of
course
strengthens
the
power
of
the
imagination
as
it
does
that
of
the
memory
the
two
powers
being
intimately
related
the
imagination
may
be
strengthened
and
trained
by
deliberately
recalling
previous
impressions
and
then
combining
them
into
new
relations
the
materials
of
memory
may
be
torn
apart
and
then
and
in
the
same
way
one
may
enter
into
the
feelings
and
thoughts
of
other
persons
by
imagining
one
self
in
their
place
and
endeavoring
to
act
out
in
imagination
the
life
of
such
persons
in
this
way
one
may
build
up
a
much
fuller
and
broader
conception
of
human
nature
and
human
motives
in
this
place
also
we
should
caution
the
student
against
the
common
waste
of
the
powers
of
the
imagination
and
the
dissipation
of
its
powers
in
idle
fancies
and
daydreams
many
persons
misuse
their
imagination
in
this
way
and
not
only
weaken
its
power
for
effective
work
but
also
waste
their
time
and
energy
daydreams
are
notoriously
unfit
for
the
real
practical
work
of
life
imagination
and
ideals
and
finally
the
student
should
remember
that
in
the
category
of
the
imaginative
powers
must
be
placed
that
phase
of
mental
activity
which
has
so
much
to
do
with
the
making
or
marring
of
one
life
the
formation
of
ideals
our
ideals
are
the
patterns
after
which
we
shape
our
life
according
to
the
nature
of
our
ideals
is
the
character
of
the
life
we
lead
our
ideals
are
the
supports
of
that
which
we
call
it
is
a
truth
old
as
the
race
and
now
being
perceived
most
clearly
by
thinkers
that
indeed
as
a
man
thinketh
in
his
heart
so
is
he
the
influence
of
our
ideals
is
perceived
to
affect
not
only
our
character
but
also
our
place
and
degree
of
success
in
life
we
grow
to
be
that
of
which
we
have
held
ideals
if
we
create
an
ideal
either
of
general
qualities
or
else
these
qualities
as
manifested
by
some
person
living
or
dead
and
keep
that
ideal
ever
before
us
we
can
not
help
developing
traits
and
qualities
corresponding
to
those
of
our
ideal
careful
thought
will
show
that
character
depends
greatly
upon
the
nature
of
our
ideals
therefore
we
see
the
effect
of
the
imagination
in
character
building
moreover
our
imagination
has
an
important
bearing
on
our
actions
many
a
man
has
committed
an
imprudent
or
immoral
act
which
he
would
not
have
done
had
he
been
possessed
of
an
imagination
which
showed
him
the
probable
results
of
the
action
in
the
same
way
many
men
have
been
inspired
to
great
deeds
and
achievements
by
reason
of
their
imagination
picturing
to
them
the
possible
results
of
certain
action
the
big
things
in
all
walks
of
life
have
been
performed
by
men
who
had
sufficient
imagination
to
picture
the
possibilities
of
certain
courses
or
plans
the
railroads
bridges
telegraph
lines
cable
lines
and
other
works
of
man
are
the
results
of
the
imagination
of
some
men
the
good
fairy
godmother
always
provides
a
vivid
and
lively
imagination
among
the
gifts
she
bestows
upon
her
beloved
godchildren
well
did
the
old
philosopher
pray
to
the
gods
and
with
all
give
unto
me
a
clear
and
active
imagination
the
dramatic
values
of
life
depend
upon
the
quality
of
the
imagination
life
without
imagination
is
mechanical
and
dreary
imagination
may
increase
the
susceptibility
to
pain
but
it
pays
for
this
by
increasing
the
capacity
for
joy
and
happiness
the
pig
has
but
little
imagination
little
pain
and
little
joy
but
who
envies
the
pig
the
person
with
a
clear
and
active
imagination
is
in
a
measure
a
creator
of
his
world
or
at
least
a
he
takes
an
active
part
in
the
creative
activities
of
the
universe
instead
of
being
a
mere
pawn
pushed
here
and
there
in
the
game
of
life
again
the
divine
gift
of
sympathy
and
understanding
depends
materially
upon
the
possession
of
a
good
imagination
one
can
never
understand
the
pain
or
problems
of
another
unless
he
first
can
imagine
himself
in
the
place
of
the
other
imagination
is
at
the
very
heart
of
sympathy
one
may
be
possessed
of
great
capacity
for
feeling
but
owing
to
his
lack
of
imagination
may
never
have
this
feeling
called
into
action
the
person
who
would
sympathize
with
others
must
first
learn
to
understand
them
and
feel
their
emotions
this
he
can
do
only
if
he
has
the
proper
degree
of
imagination
those
who
reach
the
heart
of
the
people
must
first
be
reached
by
the
feelings
of
the
people
and
this
is
possible
only
to
him
whose
imagination
enables
him
to
picture
himself
in
the
same
condition
as
others
and
thus
awaken
his
latent
feelings
and
sympathies
and
understanding
thus
it
is
seen
that
the
imagination
touches
not
only
our
intellectual
life
but
also
our
emotional
nature
imagination
is
the
very
life
of
the
soul
chapter
x
the
feelings
in
thinking
of
the
mind
and
its
activities
we
are
accustomed
to
the
general
idea
that
the
mental
processes
are
chiefly
those
of
intellect
reason
thought
but
as
a
fact
the
greater
part
of
the
mental
activities
are
those
concerned
with
feeling
and
emotion
the
intellect
is
the
youngest
child
of
the
mind
and
while
making
its
presence
strenuously
known
in
the
manner
of
all
youngest
children
so
that
one
is
perhaps
justified
in
regarding
it
as
the
whole
thing
in
the
family
nevertheless
it
really
plays
but
a
comparatively
small
part
in
the
general
work
of
the
mental
family
the
activities
of
the
feeling
side
of
life
greatly
outnumber
those
of
the
thinking
side
are
far
stronger
in
their
influence
and
effect
as
a
rule
and
in
fact
so
color
the
intellectual
processes
unconsciously
as
to
constitute
their
distinctive
quality
except
in
the
case
of
a
very
few
advanced
thinkers
but
there
is
a
difference
between
feeling
and
emotion
as
the
terms
are
employed
in
psychology
the
former
is
the
simple
phase
the
latter
the
complex
generally
speaking
the
resemblance
or
difference
is
akin
to
that
existing
between
sensation
and
perception
as
explained
in
a
previous
chapter
beginning
with
the
simple
in
order
later
on
to
reach
the
complex
we
shall
now
consider
that
which
is
known
as
simple
feeling
the
term
feeling
as
used
in
this
connection
in
psychology
has
been
defined
as
the
simple
or
side
of
any
mental
state
these
agreeable
or
disagreeable
sides
of
mental
states
are
quite
distinct
from
the
act
of
knowing
which
accompanies
them
one
may
perceive
and
thus
know
that
another
is
speaking
to
him
and
be
fully
aware
of
the
words
being
used
and
of
their
meaning
ordinarily
and
so
far
as
pure
thought
processes
are
concerned
this
would
complete
the
mental
state
but
we
must
reckon
on
the
feeling
side
as
well
as
on
the
thinking
side
of
the
mental
state
accordingly
we
find
that
the
knowledge
of
the
words
of
the
other
person
and
the
meaning
thereof
results
in
a
mental
state
agreeable
or
disagreeable
in
the
same
way
the
reading
of
the
words
of
a
book
the
hearing
of
a
song
or
a
sight
or
scene
perceived
may
result
in
a
more
or
less
strong
feeling
agreeable
or
disagreeable
this
sense
of
agreeable
or
disagreeable
consciousness
is
the
essential
characteristic
of
what
we
call
feeling
it
is
very
difficult
to
explain
feeling
except
in
its
own
terms
we
know
very
well
what
we
mean
or
what
another
means
when
it
is
said
that
we
or
he
sad
or
has
a
joyous
feeling
or
a
feeling
of
interest
and
yet
we
shall
find
it
very
hard
to
explain
the
mental
state
except
in
terms
of
feeling
itself
our
knowledge
depends
entirely
upon
our
previous
experience
of
the
feeling
as
an
authority
says
if
we
have
never
felt
pleasure
pain
fear
or
sorrow
a
quarto
volume
can
not
make
us
understand
what
such
a
mental
state
is
every
mental
state
is
not
distinguished
by
strong
feeling
there
are
certain
mental
states
which
are
concerned
chiefly
with
intellectual
effort
and
in
which
all
trace
of
feeling
seems
to
be
absent
unless
as
some
have
claimed
the
feeling
of
interest
or
the
lack
of
same
is
a
faint
form
of
the
feeling
of
pleasure
or
pain
habit
may
dull
the
feeling
of
a
mental
state
until
it
is
apparently
neutral
but
there
is
generally
a
faint
feeling
of
like
or
dislike
still
left
the
elementary
forms
of
feeling
are
closely
allied
with
those
of
simple
sensation
but
experiments
have
revealed
that
there
is
a
distinction
in
consciousness
it
has
been
discovered
that
one
is
often
conscious
of
the
touch
of
a
heated
object
before
he
is
of
the
feeling
or
pain
resulting
from
it
psychologists
have
pointed
out
another
distinction
namely
when
we
experience
a
sensation
we
are
accustomed
to
refer
it
to
the
outside
thing
which
is
the
object
of
it
as
when
we
touch
the
heated
object
but
when
we
experience
a
feeling
we
instinctively
refer
it
to
ourself
as
when
the
heated
object
gives
us
pain
as
an
authority
has
said
my
feelings
belong
to
me
but
my
sensations
seem
to
belong
to
the
object
which
caused
them
another
proof
of
the
difference
and
distinction
between
sensation
and
feeling
is
the
fact
that
the
same
sensation
will
produce
different
feelings
in
different
persons
experiencing
the
former
even
at
the
same
time
for
instance
the
same
sight
will
cause
one
person
to
feel
elated
and
the
other
depressed
the
same
words
will
produce
a
feeling
of
joy
in
one
and
a
feeling
of
sorrow
in
another
the
same
sensation
will
produce
different
feelings
in
the
same
person
at
different
times
an
authority
well
says
you
drop
your
purse
and
you
see
it
lying
on
the
ground
as
you
stoop
to
pick
it
up
with
no
feeling
either
of
pleasure
or
pain
but
if
you
see
it
after
you
have
lost
it
and
have
hunted
for
it
a
long
time
in
vain
you
have
a
pronounced
feeling
of
pleasure
there
is
a
vast
range
of
degree
and
kind
in
feeling
gordy
says
all
forms
of
pleasure
and
pain
are
called
feelings
between
the
pleasure
which
comes
from
eating
a
peach
and
that
which
results
from
solving
a
difficult
problem
or
learning
good
news
of
a
friend
or
thinking
of
the
progress
of
civilization
between
the
pain
that
results
from
a
cut
in
the
hand
and
that
which
results
from
the
failure
of
a
plan
or
the
death
of
a
friend
there
is
a
long
distance
but
the
one
group
are
all
pleasures
the
other
all
pains
and
whatever
the
source
of
the
pleasure
or
pain
it
is
alike
feeling
there
are
many
different
kinds
of
feelings
some
arise
from
sensations
of
physical
comfort
or
discomfort
others
from
purely
physiological
conditions
others
from
the
satisfaction
of
accustomed
tastes
or
the
dissatisfaction
arising
from
the
stimulation
of
unaccustomed
tastes
others
from
the
presence
or
absence
of
comfort
others
from
the
presence
or
absence
of
things
or
persons
for
whom
we
have
an
affection
or
liking
often
transforms
the
feeling
of
pleasure
into
that
of
pain
and
likewise
habit
and
practice
may
cause
us
to
experience
a
pleasurable
feeling
from
that
which
formerly
inspired
feeling
of
an
opposite
kind
feelings
also
differ
in
degree
that
is
to
say
some
things
cause
us
to
experience
pleasurable
feelings
of
a
greater
intensity
than
do
others
and
some
cause
us
to
experience
painful
feelings
of
a
greater
intensity
than
do
others
these
degrees
of
intensity
depend
more
or
less
upon
the
habit
or
experience
of
the
individual
as
a
general
rule
feelings
may
be
classified
into
those
arising
from
physical
sensations
and
those
arising
from
ideas
the
feelings
depending
upon
physical
sensations
arise
either
from
inherited
tendencies
and
inclinations
or
from
acquired
habits
and
experience
it
is
an
axiom
of
the
evolutionary
school
that
any
physical
activity
that
has
been
a
habit
of
the
race
long
continued
becomes
an
instinctive
activity
in
the
individual
for
instance
the
race
for
many
generations
was
compelled
to
hunt
fish
travel
swim
in
order
to
maintain
existence
the
result
is
that
we
the
descendants
are
apt
to
find
pleasure
in
the
same
activities
as
sport
games
exercise
etc
many
of
our
tendencies
and
feelings
are
inherited
in
this
way
to
these
we
have
added
many
acquired
habits
of
physical
activity
which
follow
the
same
rule
that
habit
and
practice
impart
more
or
less
pleasurable
feeling
we
find
more
pleasure
in
doing
those
things
which
we
can
do
easily
or
quite
well
than
in
the
opposite
kind
of
things
the
feelings
depending
upon
ideas
may
also
arise
from
inheritance
many
of
our
mental
tendencies
and
inclinations
have
come
down
to
us
from
the
past
there
are
certain
feelings
that
are
born
in
one
without
a
doubt
that
is
to
say
there
is
a
great
capacity
for
such
feelings
which
will
be
transformed
into
manifestation
upon
the
presentation
of
the
proper
stimulus
other
mental
feelings
depend
upon
our
individual
past
experience
association
or
suggestions
from
others
upon
our
past
environment
in
fact
the
ideals
of
those
around
us
will
cause
us
to
experience
pleasure
or
pain
as
the
case
may
be
under
certain
circumstances
the
force
of
suggestion
along
these
lines
is
very
strong
indeed
not
only
do
we
experience
feelings
in
response
to
present
sensations
but
the
recollection
of
some
previous
experience
will
also
arouse
feeling
in
fact
feelings
of
this
kind
are
closely
bound
up
with
memory
and
imagination
persons
of
vivid
imagination
are
apt
to
feel
far
more
than
others
they
suffer
more
and
enjoy
more
our
sympathies
which
depend
largely
upon
our
imaginative
power
are
the
cause
of
many
of
our
feelings
of
this
kind
many
of
the
facts
which
we
generally
ascribe
to
feeling
are
really
a
part
of
the
phenomena
of
emotion
the
latter
being
the
more
complex
phase
of
feeling
for
the
purposes
of
this
consideration
we
have
regarded
simple
feeling
as
the
raw
material
of
emotion
the
relation
being
compared
to
that
existing
between
sensation
and
perception
in
our
consideration
of
emotion
we
shall
see
the
fuller
manifestation
of
feeling
and
its
more
complex
expressions
chapter
xi
the
emotions
as
we
have
seen
in
the
preceding
lessons
an
emotion
is
the
more
complex
phase
of
feeling
as
a
rule
an
emotion
arises
from
a
number
of
feelings
moreover
it
is
of
a
higher
order
of
mental
activity
as
we
have
seen
a
feeling
may
arise
either
from
a
physical
sensation
or
from
an
idea
emotion
however
as
a
rule
is
dependent
upon
for
its
expression
and
always
upon
an
idea
for
its
direction
and
its
continuance
feeling
of
course
is
the
elemental
spirit
of
all
emotional
states
and
as
an
authority
has
said
is
the
thread
upon
which
the
emotional
states
are
strung
halleck
says
when
representative
ideas
appear
the
feeling
in
combination
with
them
produces
emotion
after
the
waters
of
the
missouri
combine
with
another
stream
they
receive
a
different
name
although
they
flow
toward
the
gulf
in
as
great
volume
as
before
suppose
we
liken
the
feeling
due
to
sensation
to
the
missouri
river
the
train
of
representative
ideas
to
the
mississippi
before
its
junction
with
the
missouri
emotion
may
then
be
likened
to
the
mississippi
its
junction
after
feeling
has
combined
with
representative
ideas
the
emotional
stream
will
not
be
broader
and
deeper
than
before
this
analogy
is
employed
only
to
make
the
distinction
clearer
the
student
must
remember
that
mental
powers
are
never
actually
as
distinct
as
two
rivers
before
their
union
the
student
must
beware
of
thinking
that
we
have
done
with
feeling
when
we
consider
emotion
just
as
the
waters
of
the
missouri
flow
on
until
they
reach
the
gulf
so
does
feeling
run
through
every
emotional
state
in
the
above
analogy
the
term
representative
ideas
of
course
means
the
ideas
of
memory
and
imagination
as
explained
in
previous
chapters
there
is
a
close
relation
between
emotion
and
the
physical
expression
thereof
a
peculiar
mutual
action
and
reaction
between
the
mental
state
and
the
physical
action
accompanying
it
psychologists
are
divided
regarding
this
relation
one
school
holds
that
the
physical
expression
follows
and
results
from
the
mental
state
for
instance
we
hear
or
see
something
and
thereupon
experience
the
feeling
or
emotion
of
anger
this
emotional
feeling
reacts
upon
the
body
and
causes
an
increased
heart
beat
a
tight
closing
of
the
lips
a
frown
and
lowered
eyebrows
and
clinched
fists
or
we
may
perceive
something
which
causes
the
feeling
or
emotion
of
fear
which
reacts
upon
the
body
and
produces
pallor
raising
of
the
hair
dropping
of
the
jaw
opening
of
the
eyelids
trembling
of
the
legs
etc
according
to
this
school
and
the
popular
idea
the
mental
state
precedes
and
causes
the
physical
expression
but
another
school
of
psychology
of
which
the
late
william
james
is
a
leading
authority
holds
that
the
physical
expression
precedes
and
causes
the
mental
state
for
instance
in
the
cases
above
cited
the
perception
of
the
or
sight
first
causes
a
reflex
action
upon
the
muscles
according
to
inherited
race
habits
of
expression
this
muscular
expression
and
activity
in
turn
is
held
to
react
upon
the
mind
and
to
cause
the
feeling
or
emotion
of
anger
or
fear
as
the
case
may
be
professor
james
in
some
of
his
works
makes
a
forcible
argument
in
support
of
this
theory
and
his
opinions
have
influenced
the
scientific
thought
of
the
day
upon
this
subject
others
however
have
sought
to
combat
his
theory
by
equally
forcible
argument
and
the
subject
is
still
under
lively
and
spirited
discussion
in
psychological
circles
without
taking
sides
in
the
above
controversy
many
psychologists
proceed
upon
the
hypothesis
that
there
is
a
mutual
action
and
reaction
between
emotional
mental
states
and
the
appropriate
physical
expression
thereof
each
in
a
measure
being
the
cause
of
the
other
and
each
likewise
being
the
effect
of
the
other
for
instance
in
the
cases
above
cited
the
perception
of
the
or
sight
causes
almost
or
quite
simultaneously
the
emotional
mental
state
of
anger
or
fear
as
the
case
may
be
and
the
physical
expression
thereof
then
rapidly
ensues
a
series
of
mental
and
physical
reactions
the
mental
state
acts
upon
the
physical
expression
and
intensifies
it
the
physical
expression
in
turn
reacts
upon
the
mental
state
and
induces
a
more
intense
degree
of
the
emotional
feeling
and
so
on
until
the
mental
state
and
physical
expression
reach
their
highest
point
and
then
begin
to
subside
from
exhaustion
of
energy
this
conception
meets
all
the
requirements
of
the
facts
and
is
probably
more
nearly
correct
than
either
extreme
theory
darwin
in
his
classic
work
the
expression
of
the
emotions
in
man
and
animals
has
thrown
a
great
light
on
the
subject
of
the
expression
of
emotion
in
physical
motions
the
florentine
scientist
paolo
mantegazza
added
to
darwin
work
with
ideas
of
his
own
and
countless
examples
drawn
from
his
own
experience
and
observation
the
work
of
franÃ§ois
delsarte
the
founder
of
the
school
of
expression
which
bears
his
name
is
also
a
most
valuable
addition
to
the
thought
on
this
subject
the
subject
of
the
relation
and
reaction
between
emotional
feeling
and
physical
expression
is
a
most
fascinating
one
and
one
in
which
we
may
expect
interesting
and
valuable
discoveries
during
the
next
twenty
years
the
relation
and
reaction
above
mentioned
are
interesting
not
only
from
the
viewpoint
of
theory
but
also
because
of
their
practicable
application
in
emotional
development
and
training
it
is
an
established
truth
of
psychology
that
each
physical
expression
of
an
emotional
state
serves
to
intensify
the
latter
it
is
pouring
oil
on
the
fire
likewise
it
is
equally
true
that
the
repression
of
the
physical
expression
of
an
emotion
tends
to
restrain
and
inhibit
the
emotion
itself
halleck
says
if
we
watch
a
person
growing
angry
we
shall
see
the
emotion
increase
as
he
talks
loud
frowns
deeply
clinches
his
fist
and
gesticulates
wildly
each
expression
of
his
passion
is
reflected
back
upon
the
original
anger
and
adds
fuel
to
the
fire
if
he
resolutely
inhibits
the
muscular
expressions
of
his
anger
it
will
not
attain
great
intensity
and
it
will
soon
die
a
quiet
death
not
without
reason
are
those
persons
called
cold
blooded
who
habitually
restrain
as
far
as
possible
the
expression
of
their
emotion
who
never
frown
or
throw
any
feeling
into
their
tones
even
when
a
wrong
inflicted
upon
some
one
demands
aggressive
measures
there
is
here
no
wave
of
bodily
expression
to
flow
back
and
augment
the
emotional
state
in
this
connection
we
call
your
attention
to
the
familiar
and
passage
from
the
works
of
william
james
refuse
to
express
a
passion
and
it
dies
count
ten
before
venting
your
anger
and
its
occasion
seems
ridiculous
whistling
to
keep
up
courage
is
no
mere
figure
of
speech
on
the
other
hand
sit
all
day
in
a
moping
posture
sigh
and
reply
to
everything
with
a
dismal
voice
and
your
melancholy
lingers
there
is
no
more
valuable
precept
in
moral
education
than
this
as
all
who
have
experience
know
if
we
wish
to
conquer
undesirable
emotional
tendencies
in
ourselves
we
must
assiduously
and
in
the
first
instance
go
through
the
outward
movements
of
those
contrary
dispositions
which
we
prefer
to
cultivate
smooth
the
brow
brighten
the
eye
contract
the
dorsal
rather
than
the
ventral
aspect
of
the
frame
and
speak
in
a
major
key
and
your
heart
must
be
frigid
indeed
if
it
does
not
gradually
thaw
along
the
same
lines
halleck
says
actors
have
frequently
testified
to
the
fact
that
emotion
will
arise
if
they
go
through
the
appropriate
muscular
movements
in
talking
to
a
character
on
the
stage
if
they
clinch
the
fists
and
frown
they
often
find
themselves
becoming
really
angry
if
they
start
with
counterfeit
laughter
they
find
themselves
growing
cheerful
a
german
professor
says
that
he
can
not
walk
with
a
schoolgirl
mincing
step
and
air
without
feeling
frivolous
the
wise
student
will
acquire
a
great
control
over
his
emotional
nature
if
he
will
and
study
the
above
statements
and
quotations
until
he
has
grasped
their
spirit
and
essence
in
those
few
lines
he
is
given
a
philosophy
of
and
that
will
be
worth
much
to
him
if
he
will
but
apply
it
in
practice
patience
perseverance
practice
and

are
required

the
reward
is
great
even
to
those
who
have
not
the
persistency
to
apply
this
truth
fully
there
will
be
a
partial
reward
if
they
will
use
it
to
the
extent
of
restraining
so
far
as
possible
any
undue
physical
expression
of
undesirable
emotional
excitement
some
writers
seem
to
regard
capacity
for
great
emotional
excitement
and
expression
as
a
mark
of
a
rich
and
full
character
or
noble
soul
this
is
far
from
being
true
while
it
is
a
fact
that
the
cultivation
of
certain
emotions
tends
to
create
a
noble
character
and
a
full
life
it
is
equally
true
that
the
tendency
to
gush
and
indulge
in
hysterical
or
sentimental
excesses
is
a
mark
of
an
nature
and
a
weak
rather
than
strong
character
moreover
it
is
a
fact
that
excess
in
emotional
excitement
and
expression
tends
toward
the
dissipation
of
the
finer
and
nobler
feelings
which
otherwise
would
seek
an
outlet
in
actual
doing
and
practical
action
in
the
language
of
the
old
scotch
engineer
in
the
story
they
are
like
the
old
locomotive
which
spends
sae
much
steam
at
the
whustle
that
she
hae
nane
left
to
gae
by
emotional
excitement
and
expression
are
largely
dependent
upon
habit
and
indulgence
although
there
is
a
great
difference
of
course
in
the
emotional
nature
and
tendencies
of
various
persons
emotions
like
physical
actions
or
intellectual
processes
become
habitual
by
repetition
and
habit
renders
all
physical
or
mental
actions
easy
of
repetition
each
time
one
manifests
anger
the
deeper
the
mental
path
is
made
and
the
easier
it
is
to
travel
that
path
the
next
time
in
the
same
way
each
time
that
anger
is
conquered
and
inhibited
the
easier
will
it
be
to
restrain
it
the
next
time
in
the
same
way
desirable
habits
of
emotion
and
expression
may
be
formed
another
point
in
the
cultivation
training
and
restraint
of
the
emotions
is
that
which
has
to
do
with
the
control
of
the
ideas
which
we
allow
to
come
into
the
mind
ideative
habits
may
be
formed
formed
in
fact
by
the
majority
of
persons
we
may
cultivate
the
habit
of
looking
on
the
bright
side
of
things
of
looking
for
the
best
in
those
we
meet
of
expecting
the
best
things
instead
of
the
worst
by
resolutely
refusing
to
give
welcome
to
ideas
calculated
to
arouse
certain
emotions
feelings
passions
desires
sentiments
or
similar
mental
states
we
may
do
much
to
prevent
the
arousing
of
the
emotion
itself
emotions
usually
are
called
forth
by
some
idea
and
if
we
shut
out
the
idea
we
may
prevent
the
emotional
feeling
from
appearing
in
this
connection
the
universal
rule
of
psychology
may
be
applied
mental
state
may
be
inhibited
or
restrained
by
turning
the
attention
to
the
opposite
mental
the
control
of
the
attention
is
really
the
control
of
every
mental
state
we
may
use
the
will
in
the
direction
of
the
control
of
the
attention
the
development
and
direction
of
voluntary
attention
and
thus
actually
control
every
phase
of
mental
activity
the
will
is
nearest
to
the
ego
or
central
being
of
man
and
the
attention
is
the
chief
tool
and
instrument
of
the
will
this
fact
can
not
be
repeated
too
often
if
it
is
impressed
upon
the
mind
it
will
prove
to
be
useful
and
valuable
in
many
emergencies
of
mental
life
he
who
controls
his
attention
controls
his
mind
and
in
controlling
his
mind
controls
himself
chapter
xii
the
instinctive
emotions
many
attempts
to
classify
the
emotions
have
been
made
by
the
psychologists
but
the
best
authorities
hold
that
beyond
the
purpose
of
ordinary
convenience
in
considering
the
subject
classification
is
scientifically
useless
by
reason
of
its
incompleteness
as
james
cleverly
puts
it
any
classification
of
the
emotions
is
seen
to
be
as
true
and
as
natural
as
any
other
if
it
only
serves
some
purpose
the
difficulty
attending
the
attempted
classification
arises
from
the
fact
that
every
emotion
is
more
or
less
complex
and
is
made
up
of
various
feelings
and
shades
of
emotional
excitement
each
emotion
blends
into
others
just
as
a
few
elements
of
matter
may
be
grouped
into
hundreds
of
thousands
of
combinations
so
the
elements
of
feeling
may
be
grouped
into
thousands
of
shades
of
emotion
it
is
said
that
the
two
elements
of
carbon
and
hydrogen
form
combinations
resulting
in
five
thousand
varieties
of
material
substance
from
anthracite
to
marsh
gas
from
black
coke
to
colorless
naphtha
the
same
thing
may
be
said
of
the
emotional
combinations
formed
from
two
principal
elements
of
feeling
moreover
the
close
distinction
between
sensation
and
feeling
on
the
one
hand
and
between
feeling
and
emotion
on
the
other
serves
to
further
complicate
the
task
for
the
purposes
of
our
consideration
let
us
divide
the
emotions
into
five
general
classes
as
follows
instinctive
emotions
social
emotions
religious
emotions
Ã¦sthetic
emotions
intellectual
emotions
we
shall
now
consider
each
of
the
above
five
classes
in
turn
the
instinctive
emotions
instinct
is
defined
as
unconscious
involuntary
or
unreasoning
prompting
to
any
action
or
the
natural
unreasoning
impulse
by
which
an
animal
is
guided
to
the
performance
of
any
action
without
thought
of
improving
the
method
an
authority
says
instinct
is
a
natural
impulse
leading
animals
even
prior
to
all
experience
to
perform
certain
actions
tending
to
the
welfare
of
the
individual
or
the
perpetuation
of
the
species
apparently
without
understanding
the
object
at
which
they
may
be
supposed
to
aim
or
deliberating
as
to
the
best
methods
to
employ
in
many
cases
as
in
the
construction
of
the
cells
of
the
bee
there
is
a
perfection
about
the
result
which
reasoning
man
could
not
have
equaled
except
by
an
application
of
the
higher
mathematics
to
direct
the
operations
carried
out
darwin
considers
that
animals
in
time
past
as
now
have
varied
in
their
mental
qualities
and
that
those
variations
are
inherited
instincts
also
vary
slightly
in
a
state
of
nature
this
being
so
natural
selection
can
ultimately
bring
them
to
a
high
degree
of
perfection
it
was
formerly
the
fashion
to
ascribe
instinct
in
the
lower
animals
and
in
man
to
something
akin
to
innate
ideas
implanted
in
each
species
and
thereafter
continued
by
inheritance
but
the
application
of
the
idea
of
evolution
to
the
science
of
psychology
has
resulted
in
brushing
away
these
old
ideas
it
holds
that
that
which
we
call
instinct
is
the
result
of
gradual
development
in
the
course
of
evolution
the
accumulated
experience
of
the
race
being
stored
away
in
the
race
memory
each
individual
adding
a
little
thereto
by
his
acquired
habits
and
experiences
psychologists
now
hold
that
the
lower
forms
of
these
race
tendencies
are
closely
akin
to
purely
reflex
actions
and
the
higher
forms
which
are
known
as
instinctive
emotions
are
phenomena
of
the
subconscious
mind
resulting
from
race
memory
and
race
experience
clodd
says
instinct
is
the
higher
form
of
reflex
action
the
salmon
migrates
from
sea
to

the
bird
makes
its
nest
or
migrates
from
one
zone
to
another
by
an
unvarying
route
even
leaving
its
young
behind
to
perish
the
bee

the
spider

the

balances

and
picks
up

of
corn
the
newborn
babe
sucks
its
mother
breast
all
in
virtue
of
like
acts
on
the
part
of
their
ancestors
which
arising
in
the
needs
of
the
creature
and
gradually
becoming
automatic
have
not
varied
during
long
ages
the
tendency
to
repeat
them
being
transmitted
within
the
germ
from
which
insect
fish
bird
and
man
have
severally
sprung
schneider
says
it
is
a
fact
that
men
especially
in
childhood
fear
to
go
into
a
dark
cavern
or
a
gloomy
wood
this
feeling
of
fear
arises
to
be
sure
partly
from
the
fact
that
we
easily
suspect
that
dangerous
beasts
may
lurk
in
these
localities
a
suspicion
due
to
stories
we
have
heard
and
read
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
quite
sure
that
this
fear
at
a
certain
perception
is
also
directly
inherited
children
who
have
been
carefully
guarded
from
all
ghost
stories
are
nevertheless
terrified
and
cry
if
led
into
a
dark
place
especially
if
sounds
are
made
there
even
an
adult
can
easily
observe
that
an
uncomfortable
timidity
steals
over
him
in
a
lonely
wood
at
night
although
he
may
have
the
fixed
conviction
that
not
the
slightest
danger
is
near
this
feeling
of
fear
occurs
in
many
men
even
in
their
own
houses
after
dark
although
it
is
much
stronger
in
a
dark
cavern
or
forest
the
fact
of
such
instinctive
fear
is
easily
explicable
when
we
consider
that
our
savage
ancestors
through
immemorable
generations
were
accustomed
to
meet
with
dangerous
beasts
in
caverns
especially
bears
and
were
for
the
most
part
attacked
by
such
beasts
during
the
night
and
in
the
woods
and
that
thus
an
inseparable
association
between
the
perceptions
of
darkness
caverns
woods
and
fear
took
place
and
was
inherited
james
says
nothing
is
commoner
than
the
remark
that
man
differs
from
lower
creatures
by
the
almost
total
absence
of
instincts
and
the
assumption
of
their
work
in
him
by
reason
we
may
confidently
say
that
however
uncertain
man
reactions
upon
his
environment
may
sometimes
seem
in
comparison
with
those
of
the
lower
mammals
the
uncertainty
is
probably
not
due
to
their
possession
of
any
principles
of
action
which
he
lacks
the
contrary
man
possesses
all
the
impulses
that
they
have
and
a
great
many
more
high
places
cause
fear
of
a
peculiarly
sickening
sort
though
here
again
individuals
differ
the
utterly
blind
instinctive
character
of
the
motor
impulses
here
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
they
are
almost
always
entirely
unreasonable
but
that
reason
is
powerless
to
suppress
them
certain
ideas
of
supernatural
agency
associated
with
real
circumstances
produce
a
peculiar
kind
of
horror
this
horror
is
probably
explicable
as
the
result
of
a
combination
of
simple
horrors
to
bring
the
ghostly
terror
to
its
maximum
many
unusual
elements
of
the
dreadful
must
combine
such
as
loneliness
darkness
inexplicable
sounds
especially
of
a
dismal
character
moving
pictures
half
discerned
or
if
discerned
of
dreadful
aspect
and
a
vertiginous
baffling
of
the
expectation
in
view
of
the
fact
that
cadaveric
reptilian
and
underground
horrors
play
so
specific
and
constant
a
part
in
many
nightmares
and
forms
of
delirium
it
seems
not
altogether
unwise
to
ask
whether
these
forms
of
dreadful
circumstance
may
not
at
a
former
period
have
been
more
normal
objects
of
the
environment
than
now
the
evolutionist
ought
to
have
no
difficulty
in
explaining
these
terrors
and
the
scenery
that
provokes
them
as
relapses
into
the
consciousness
of
the
cave
men
a
consciousness
usually
overlaid
in
us
by
experiences
of
a
more
recent
date
instinctive
emotion
manifests
as
an
impulse
arising
from
the
dim
recesses
of
the
feeling
or
emotional
nature
an
incentive
toward
a
dimly
conscious
end
it
differs
from
the
almost
purely
automatic
nature
of
certain
forms
of
reflex
process
for
its
beginning
is
a
feeling
arising
from
the
subconscious
regions
which
strives
to
excite
an
activity
of
conscious
volition
the
feeling
is
from
the
subconscious
but
the
activity
is
conscious
the
end
may
not
be
perceived
in
consciousness
or
at
least
is
but
dimly
perceived
but
the
action
leading
to
the
end
is
in
full
consciousness
instinct
is
seen
to
have
its
origin
in
the
past
experiences
of
the
race
transmitted
by
heredity
and
preserved
in
the
race
memory
it
has
for
its
object
the
preservation
of
the
individual
and
of
the
species
its
end
is
often
something
far
removed
in
time
from
the
moment
or
the
welfare
of
the
species
rather
than
that
of
the
individual
for
instance
the
caterpillar
providing
for
its
future
states
or
the
bird
building
its
nest
or
the
bees
building
cells
and
providing
honey
for
their
successors
for
very
few
bees
live
to
partake
of
the
honey
which
they
have
gathered
and
stored
they
are
animated
by
the
spirit
of
the
hive
the
most
elementary
forms
of
the
instinctive
emotions
are
those
which
have
to
do
with
the
preservation
of
the
individual
his
comfort
and
personal
physical
welfare
this
class
of
emotions
comprises
what
are
generally
known
as
purely
selfish
feelings
having
little
or
no
concern
for
the
welfare
of
others
in
this
class
we
find
the
emotional
feelings
which
have
to
do
with
the
satisfaction
of
hunger
and
thirst
the
securing
of
comfortable
quarters
and
warm
clothing
and
the
spirit
of
combat
and
strife
arising
from
the
desire
to
obtain
these
these
elemental
feelings
had
their
birth
early
in
the
history
of
life
and
indeed
life
itself
depended
very
materially
upon
them
for
its
preservation
and
continuance
it
was
necessary
for
the
primitive
living
thing
to
be
selfish
when
man
appeared
only
those
survived
who
manifested
these
feelings
strongly
the
others
were
pushed
to
the
wall
and
perished
even
in
our
civilization
the
man
below
the
average
in
this
class
of
feelings
will
find
it
difficult
to
survive
chapter
xiii
the
passions
arising
from
the
most
elemental
instinctive
emotions
we
find
what
may
be
termed
the
passions
by
the
term
passion
is
meant
those
strong
feelings
in
which
the
elemental
selfish
instincts
are
manifested
in
relation
to
other
persons
either
in
the
phase
of
attraction
or
repulsion
in
this
class
we
find
the
elementary
phases
of
love
and
the
feelings
of
hate
anger
jealousy
revenge
etc
this
class
of
emotions
usually
manifests
violently
as
compared
with
the
other
emotions
the
passions
generally
arise
from
race
preservation
and
reproduction
and
may
be
regarded
as
a
more
complex
phase
of
the
elemental
instinctive
emotions
the
elemental
instinctive
emotions
of
and
cause
the
individual
to
experience
and
manifest
the
passional
emotions
of
desire
for
combat
anger
hate
revenge
while
the
instinctive
emotions
leading
to
reproduction
and
continuance
of
the
race
give
rise
to
the
passional
emotions
of
sexual
love
jealousy
etc
the
desire
to
attract
the
other
sex
increases
ambition
vanity
love
of
display
and
other
feelings
it
is
only
when
this
class
of
emotions
blends
with
the
higher
emotions
that
the
passions
become
purified
and
refined
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
these
emotions
were
very
necessary
for
the
welfare
of
the
race
in
the
early
stage
of
its
evolution
and
that
they
still
play
an
active
part
in
human
life
under
the
greater
or
less
restraint
imposed
by
civilized
society
nor
should
it
be
forgotten
that
from
these
emotions
have
evolved
the
highest
love
of
one
human
being
for
another
from
instinctive
sexual
love
and
the
racial
instinct
have
developed
the
higher
affection
of
man
for
woman
and
woman
for
man
in
all
their
beautiful
manifestations
and
the
love
of
the
parent
for
the
child
and
the
love
of
the
child
for
the
parent
the
first
manifestation
of
altruism
arises
in
the
love
of
the
living
creature
for
its
mate
and
in
the
love
of
the
parents
for
their
offspring
in
certain
forms
of
life
where
the
association
of
the
sexes
is
merely
for
the
moment
and
is
not
followed
by
protection
mutual
aid
and
companionship
there
is
found
an
absence
of
mutual
affection
of
any
kind
the
only
feeling
being
an
elemental
reproductive
instinct
bringing
the
male
and
female
together
for
the
moment
an
almost
purely
reflex
activity
in
the
same
way
in
the
cases
of
certain
animals
the
rattlesnake
for
instance
in
which
the
young
are
able
to
protect
themselves
from
birth
there
is
seen
a
total
absence
of
parental
affection
or
the
return
thereof
human
love
between
the
sexes
in
its
higher
and
lower
degrees
is
a
natural
evolution
from
passional
emotion
of
a
low
order
due
to
the
growth
of
social
ethical
moral
and
Ã¦sthetic
emotion
arising
from
the
necessities
of
the
increasing
complexity
and
development
of
human
life
the
simpler
forms
of
passional
emotion
are
almost
entirely
instinctive
in
their
manifestation
indeed
in
many
cases
there
appears
to
be
but
little
more
than
a
high
form
of
reflex
nervous
action
the
following
words
of
william
james
give
us
an
interesting
view
of
this
fact
of
life
the
cat
runs
after
the
mouse
runs
or
shows
fight
before
the
dog
avoids
falling
from
walls
and
trees
shuns
fire
and
water
not
because
he
has
any
notion
either
of
life
or
of
death
or
of
he
acts
in
each
case
separately
and
simply
because
he
can
not
help
it
being
so
framed
that
when
that
particular
running
thing
called
a
mouse
appears
in
his
field
of
vision
he
pursue
that
when
that
particular
barking
and
obstreperous
thing
called
a
dog
appears
there
he
retire
if
at
a
distance
and
scratch
if
close
by
that
he
withdraw
his
feet
from
water
and
his
face
from
flame
etc
now
why
do
the
various
animals
do
what
seem
to
us
such
strange
things
in
the
presence
of
such
outlandish
stimuli
why
does
the
hen
for
instance
submit
herself
to
the
tedium
of
incubating
such
a
fearfully
uninteresting
set
of
objects
as
a
nestful
of
eggs
unless
she
have
some
sort
of
prophetic
inkling
of
the
result
the
only
answer
is
we
can
only
interpret
the
instinct
of
brutes
by
what
we
know
of
instincts
in
ourselves
why
do
men
always
lie
down
when
they
can
on
soft
beds
rather
than
on
soft
floors
why
do
they
sit
around
a
stove
on
a
cold
day
why
in
a
room
do
they
place
themselves
times
out
of
a
hundred
with
their
faces
toward
its
middle
rather
than
to
the
wall
why
does
the
maiden
interest
the
youth
so
much
that
everything
about
her
seems
more
important
and
significant
than
anything
else
in
the
world
nothing
more
can
be
said
than
that
these
are
human
ways
and
that
every
creature
likes
its
own
ways
and
takes
to
following
them
as
a
matter
of
course
science
may
come
and
consider
these
ways
and
find
that
most
of
them
are
useful
but
it
is
not
for
the
sake
of
their
utility
that
they
are
followed
but
because
at
the
moment
of
following
them
we
feel
that
it
is
the
only
appropriate
and
natural
thing
to
do
not
one
man
in
a
million
when
taking
his
dinner
ever
thinks
of
its
utility
he
eats
because
the
food
tastes
good
and
makes
him
want
more
if
you
should
ask
him
he
wants
to
eat
more
of
what
tastes
like
that
instead
of
revering
you
as
a
philosopher
he
will
probably
laugh
at
you
for
a
fool
james
continues
it
takes
in
short
what
berkeley
called
a
mind
debauched
by
learning
to
carry
the
process
of
making
the
natural
seem
strange
so
far
as
to
ask
the
of
any
instinctive
human
act
to
the
metaphysician
alone
can
such
questions
arise
as
why
do
we
smile
when
pleased
and
not
scowl
why
are
we
unable
to
talk
to
a
crowd
as
to
a
single
friend
why
does
a
particular
maiden
turn
our
wits
upside
down
the
common
man
can
only
say
we
smile
our
heart
palpitates
at
the
sight
of
the
crowd
we
love
the
maiden
that
beautiful
soul
clad
in
that
perfect
form
so
palpably
and
flagrantly
made
from
all
eternity
to
be
loved
and
so
probably
does
each
animal
feel
about
the
particular
things
it
tends
to
do
in
the
presence
of
particular
objects
they
too
are
syntheses
to
the
lion
it
is
the
lioness
which
is
made
to
be
loved
to
the
bear
the
she
bear
to
the
broody
hen
the
notion
would
seem
monstrous
that
there
should
be
a
creature
in
the
world
to
whom
a
nestful
of
eggs
was
not
the
utterly
fascinating
precious
and
object
which
it
is
to
her
thus
we
may
be
sure
that
however
mysterious
some
animals
instincts
may
appear
to
us
our
instincts
will
appear
no
less
mysterious
to
them
and
we
may
conclude
that
to
the
animal
which
obeys
it
every
impulse
and
every
step
of
that
instinct
shines
with
its
own
sufficient
light
and
seems
at
the
moment
the
only
externally
right
and
proper
thing
to
do
it
may
be
done
for
its
own
sake
exclusively
one
has
very
little
need
as
a
rule
to
develop
the
passional
emotions
instinct
has
taken
pretty
good
care
that
we
shall
have
our
share
of
this
class
of
feelings
but
there
is
a
need
to
train
restrain
govern
and
control
these
emotions
for
the
conditions
which
brought
about
their
original
being
have
changed
our
social
conventions
require
that
we
should
subordinate
these
passional
feelings
to
some
extent
at
least
society
insists
that
we
must
restrict
our
love
impulses
to
certain
limits
and
to
certain
quarters
and
that
we
subdue
our
anger
and
hate
except
toward
the
enemies
of
our
land
the
disturbers
of
public
peace
and
the
menacers
of
the
social
conventions
of
our
time
and
land
the
public
welfare
requires
that
we
inhibit
our
fighting
impulses
except
in
cases
of
or
war
public
policy
requires
that
we
keep
our
ambitions
within
reasonable
limits
which
limits
change
from
time
to
time
of
course
in
short
society
has
stepped
in
and
insisted
that
man
as
a
social
being
must
not
only
acquire
a
but
must
also
develop
sociable
emotions
and
inhibit
his
unsociable
ones
the
evolution
of
man
nature
has
caused
him
unconsciously
to
modify
his
elemental
instinctive
passional
emotions
and
subordinate
them
to
the
dictates
of
social
ethical
moral
and
Ã¦sthetic
feelings
and
ideals
and
to
intellectual
considerations
even
the
original
elemental
instincts
of
the
lower
animals
have
been
modified
by
reason
of
the
social
requirements
of
the
pack
herd
or
drove
until
the
modified
instinct
is
now
the
ruling
force
the
general
principles
of
emotional
control
restraint
and
mastery
as
given
in
a
preceding
chapter
are
applicable
to
the
particular
class
of
emotions
now
under
consideration
here
by
refraining
from
the
physical
expression
one
may
at
least
partially
inhibit
the
emotion
by
refusing
to
create
the
habit
one
may
more
easily
manifest
control
by
refusing
to
dwell
upon
the
idea
or
mental
picture
of
the
exciting
object
one
may
lessen
the
stimulus
by
cultivating
the
opposite
class
of
emotions
one
may
inhibit
any
class
of
feeling
and
finally
by
acquiring
a
control
of
the
attention
by
means
of
the
will
one
has
the
reins
firmly
in
hand
and
may
drive
or
hold
back
the
steeds
of
passion
as
he
wills
the
passions
are
like
fiery
horses
useful
if
well
under
control
but
most
dangerous
if
the
control
is
lost
the
ego
is
the
driver
the
will
his
hands
attention
the
reins
habit
the
bit
and
the
passions
the
horses
to
drive
the
chariot
of
life
under
social
conditions
the
ego
must
have
strong
hands
will
to
tighten
or
loosen
the
reins
of
attention
he
must
also
employ
a
well
designed
and
shaped
bit
of
habit
without
strong
hands
good
reins
and
bit
the
fiery
steeds
of
passion
may
gain
control
and
running
away
dash
the
chariot
and
its
driver
over
the
precipice
and
on
to
the
jagged
rocks
below
chapter
xiv
the
social
emotions
as
man
became
a
social
animal
he
developed
new
traits
of
character
new
habits
of
action
new
ideals
new
customs
and
consequently
new
emotions
emotions
long
entertained
and
long
manifested
by
the
race
become
more
or
less
instinctive
and
are
passed
along
in
the
form
of
either
inherited
stimulus
akin
to
but
lesser
in
degree
and
force
than
the
more
elemental
emotions
or
of
inherited
to
manifest
the
acquired
emotional
feeling
upon
the
presentation
of
sufficiently
strong
stimuli
hence
arises
that
which
we
have
called
the
social
emotions
under
the
classification
of
the
social
emotions
are
those
acquired
tendencies
of
action
and
feeling
of
the
race
which
are
more
or
less
altruistic
and
are
concerned
with
the
welfare
of
others
and
duties
and
obligations
toward
society
and
our
fellow
men
in
this
class
are
found
the
emotions
which
impel
us
to
perform
what
we
consider
or
feel
to
be
our
duty
toward
our
neighbors
and
our
obligations
and
duty
toward
the
state
as
expressed
in
its
laws
the
customs
of
men
of
our
country
or
the
ideals
of
the
community
in
another
phase
it
manifests
as
sympathy
fellow
feeling
and
kindness
in
general
in
its
first
phase
we
find
civic
virtue
inclination
honesty
square
dealing
and
patriotism
in
its
second
phase
we
find
sympathy
for
others
charity
mutual
aid
the
alleviation
of
poverty
and
suffering
the
erection
of
asylums
for
orphans
and
the
aged
hospitals
for
the
sick
and
the
formation
of
societies
for
general
charitable
work
in
many
cases
we
find
the
social
ethical
and
moral
emotions
closely
allied
with
religious
emotion
and
by
many
these
are
supposed
to
be
practically
identical
but
there
is
a
vast
difference
in
spite
of
their
frequent
association
for
instance
we
find
many
persons
of
high
civic
virtue
of
exalted
moral
ideals
and
manifesting
ethical
qualities
of
the
most
advanced
type
who
are
lacking
in
the
ordinary
religious
feelings
on
the
other
hand
we
too
frequently
find
persons
professing
great
religious
zeal
and
apparently
experiencing
the
most
intense
religious
emotional
feeling
who
are
deficient
in
social
civic
ethical
and
moral
qualities
in
the
best
sense
of
these
terms
the
aim
of
all
religion
worthy
of
the
name
however
is
to
encourage
ethical
and
moral
as
well
as
religious
emotions
we
must
here
make
the
distinction
between
those
manifesting
the
actions
termed
ethical
and
moral
they
feel
that
and
those
who
merely
comply
with
the
conventional
requirements
they
fear
the
of
their
violation
the
first
class
have
the
true
social
ethical
and
moral
feelings
tastes
ideals
and
inclinations
while
the
second
manifest
merely
the
elementary
feelings
of
and
selfish
prudence
the
first
class
are
good
because
they
feel
that
way
and
find
it
natural
to
be
so
while
the
others
are
good
merely
because
they
have
to
be
or
be
punished
by
legal
penalty
or
public
opinion
loss
of
prestige
loss
of
financial
support
etc
the
social
moral
and
ethical
emotions
are
believed
to
have
arisen
in
the
race
by
reason
of
the
association
of
individuals
in
communities
and
the
rise
of
the
necessity
for
mutual
aid
and
forbearance
even
many
of
the
species
of
the
lower
animals
have
social
moral
or
ethical
codes
of
their
own
based
on
the
experience
of
the
species
or
family
infractions
of
which
they
punish
severely
in
the
same
way
sympathy
and
the
altruistic
feelings
are
supposed
to
have
arisen
the
community
of
interest
and
understanding
in
the
tribe
family
or
clan
brought
not
only
the
feeling
of
natural
defense
and
protection
but
also
the
finer
inner
sympathetic
feeling
of
the
pains
and
sufferings
of
their
associates
this
in
the
progress
of
the
race
has
developed
into
broader
and
more
complex
ideals
and
feelings
theology
explains
the
moral
feelings
as
resulting
from
conscience
which
it
holds
to
be
a
special
faculty
of
the
mind
or
soul
divinely
given
science
while
admitting
the
existence
of
the
state
of
feelings
which
we
call
conscience
denies
its
supernatural
origin
and
ascribes
it
to
the
result
of
evolution
heredity
experience
education
and
suggestion
conscience
according
to
science
is
a
compound
of
intellectual
and
emotional
states
conscience
is
not
an
invariable
or
infallible
guide
but
entirely
upon
the
heredity
education
experience
and
environment
of
the
it
accompanies
the
moral
and
ethical
codes
of
the
race
which
vary
with
time
and
with
country
actions
which
were
thought
right
a
century
ago
are
condemned
now
likewise
things
condemned
a
century
ago
are
thought
right
now
what
is
commended
in
turkey
is
condemned
in
england
and
vice
versa
moral
tastes
and
ideals
like
Ã¦sthetic
ones
vary
with
time
and
country
there
is
no
absolute
code
which
has
been
always
true
in
all
places
there
is
an
evolution
in
the
ideals
of
morals
and
ethics
as
in
everything
else
and
conscience
and
the
moral
and
ethical
emotions
accompany
the
changing
ideals
many
of
the
moral
and
ethical
principles
originally
arose
from
necessity
or
utility
but
have
since
developed
into
natural
spontaneous
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
race
it
is
held
that
the
race
is
rapidly
developing
a
social
conscience
which
will
cause
the
wiping
out
of
many
social
conditions
which
are
now
the
disgrace
of
civilization
it
is
predicted
that
in
time
the
race
will
look
back
upon
the
existence
of
poverty
in
our
civilization
as
our
generation
now
looks
back
upon
the
existence
of
slavery
imprisonment
for
debt
capital
punishment
for
the
theft
of
a
loaf
of
bread
the
killing
of
prisoners
of
war
etc
it
is
thought
that
in
time
wars
of
conquest
will
be
deemed
as
utterly
immoral
as
is
regarded
the
murder
of
a
body
of
men
by
a
band
of
pirates
or
bandits
in
the
same
way
the
economic
slavery
of
will
be
seen
as
immoral
as
now
seems
the
physical
slavery
of
the
past
in
not
far
distant
time
it
will
seem
incredible
that
society
could
have
ever
allowed
one
of
its
members
to
die
of
hunger
in
the
streets
or
of
poverty
and
inattention
in
the
sick
room
of
the
hovel
not
only
will
the
ideals
and
feelings
of
ethical
and
moral
responsibility
change
and
evolve
but
the
feelings
of
personal
sympathy
will
evolve
in
accordance
therewith
at
least
such
is
the
dream
and
prophecy
of
some
of
the
world
greatest
thinkers
the
social
ethical
and
moral
emotions
may
be
developed
by
a
study
of
the
evolution
and
meaning
of
society
on
the
one
hand
and
the
perception
of
the
condition
of
the
lives
of
less
fortunate
individuals
on
the
other
the
first
will
awaken
new
ideas
of
the
history
and
real
meaning
of
social
association
and
mutual
intercourse
and
will
develop
a
new
sense
of
responsibility
duty
and
civic
and
social
pride
the
second
will
awaken
understanding
and
sympathy
and
a
desire
to
do
what
one
can
to
help
those
who
are
the
under
dog
and
also
to
bring
about
a
better
state
of
affairs
in
general
the
study
of
history
and
civilization
of
sociology
and
civics
will
do
much
in
the
first
direction
the
study
of
and
its
life
problems
and
condition
will
do
the
same
in
the
second
case
in
both
cases
there
will
be
awakened
a
new
sense
of
right
and
wrong
a
new
conception
of
ought
and
ought
not
regarding
relations
to
the
race
society
and
his
fellow
beings
let
no
one
deceive
himself
or
herself
by
the
smug
assumption
that
the
race
has
entirely
emerged
from
barbarism
and
is
now
on
the
top
wave
of
civilization
the
truth
as
known
to
all
careful
and
conscientious
thinkers
is
that
we
are
but
civilized
if
indeed
that
much
many
of
our
customs
and
conventions
are
those
of
a
people
our
ideals
are
low
our
customs
often
vile
we
lack
not
only
high
ideals
but
in
many
cases
we
show
a
lack
of
sanity
in
our
social
conventions
but
evolution
is
moving
us
slowly
ahead
a
better
day
is
dawning
the
signs
are
in
the
air
to
be
seen
by
all
thoughtful
men
civilization
is
climbing
the
ladder
aided
by
the
evolution
of
the
social
ethical
and
moral
emotions
and
the
development
of
the
intellect
in
connection
with
this
phase
of
the
emotions
we
invite
the
student
to
consider
the
following
excellent
words
of
professor
davidson
in
his
history
of
greek
education
it
is
not
enough
for
a
man
to
understand
the
conditions
of
rational
life
in
his
own
time
he
must
likewise
these
conditions
and
whatever
leads
to
life
of
an
opposite
kind
this
is
only
another
way
of
saying
that
he
must
love
the
good
and
hate
the
evil
for
the
good
is
simply
what
conduces
to
rational
or
moral
life
and
the
evil
simply
what
leads
away
from
it
it
is
perfectly
obvious
as
soon
as
it
is
pointed
out
that
all
immoral
life
is
due
to
a
false
distribution
of
affection
which
again
is
often
though
by
no
means
always
due
to
a
want
of
intellectual
cultivation
he
that
attributes
to
anything
a
value
greater
or
less
than
it
really
possesses
in
the
order
of
things
has
already
placed
himself
in
a
false
relation
to
it
and
will
certainly
when
he
comes
to
act
with
reference
to
it
act
immorally
chapter
xv
the
religious
emotions
by
the
religious
emotions
is
meant
that
class
of
emotional
feeling
arising
from
the
faith
and
belief
in
or
consciousness
of
the
presence
of
supernatural
beings
powers
entities
or
forces
this
form
of
emotion
is
regarded
as
distinct
from
the
ethical
and
moral
emotions
although
frequently
found
in
connection
therewith
likewise
it
is
independent
of
any
special
form
of
intellectual
belief
for
it
is
far
more
fundamental
and
often
exists
without
creed
philosophy
or
stated
belief
the
only
manifestation
in
such
cases
being
a
feeling
of
the
existence
of
supernatural
beings
forces
and
powers
to
which
man
has
a
relation
and
to
which
he
owes
obedience
to
those
who
may
think
that
this
is
too
narrow
a
conception
of
religious
emotion
we
refer
the
following
definition
of
religion
from
the
dictionaries
the
acts
or
feelings
which
result
from
the
belief
of
a
god
or
gods
having
superior
control
over
matter
life
or
destiny
religion
is
subjective
designating
the
feelings
and
acts
of
men
which
relate
to
god
theology
is
objective
denoting
the
science
which
investigates
the
existence
laws
and
attributes
of
god
or
objectively
the
outer
form
and
embodiment
which
the
inward
spirit
of
a
true
or
a
false
devotion
assumes
subjectively
the
feeling
of
veneration
with
which
the
worshiper
regards
the
being
he
adores
darwin
in
his
descent
of
man
says
that
the
feeling
of
religious
devotion
is
a
highly
complex
one
consisting
of
love
complete
submission
to
an
exalted
and
mysterious
superior
a
strong
sense
of
dependence
fear
reverence
gratitude
hope
for
the
future
and
perhaps
other
elements
he
is
of
the
opinion
that
no
man
can
experience
so
complex
an
emotion
until
advanced
in
his
intellectual
and
moral
faculties
to
at
least
a
moderately
high
level
the
authorities
generally
agree
with
darwin
although
the
more
recent
study
of
the
history
of
religion
has
shown
that
religious
feeling
has
a
far
more
primitive
origin
than
that
indicated
by
darwin
it
is
true
that
the
lower
animals
are
not
deemed
capable
of
anything
approaching
religious
feeling
unless
there
is
a
feeling
approaching
it
in
the
attitude
of
the
dog
and
horse
and
other
domestic
animals
toward
their
masters
but
man
as
soon
as
he
is
able
to
attribute
natural
phenomena
to
a
supernatural
cause
and
power
manifests
a
crude
religious
feeling
and
emotion
he
begins
by
believing
in
fearing
and
worshiping
natural
forces
and
objects
such
as
the
sun
the
moon
the
wind
thunder
and
lightning
the
ocean
rivers
mountains
etc
it
is
claimed
that
there
is
no
natural
object
that
has
not
been
deified
and
worshiped
by
some
people
at
some
time
in
the
history
of
the
race
later
man
acquired
the
anthropomorphic
conception
of
deities
and
created
many
gods
in
his
own
image
endowing
them
with
his
own
attributes
qualities
and
characteristics
the
mental
characteristics
and
morals
of
a
people
can
always
be
ascertained
by
a
knowledge
of
the
average
conception
of
deity
held
by
them
polytheism
or
the
belief
in
many
gods
was
succeeded
by
monotheism
or
belief
in
one
god
monotheism
ranges
from
the
crudest
conception
of
a
manlike
god
to
the
highest
conception
of
a
spiritual
being
transcending
all
human
qualities
attributes
or
characteristics
man
began
by
believing
in
many
god
then
in
many
god
then
in
a
one
then
in
one
god
who
is
a
spirit
then
in
one
universal
spirit
which
is
god
it
is
a
far
cry
from
the
savage
manlike
god
of
old
to
the
conception
of
the
universal
spirit
of
the
philosopher
spinoza
the
extreme
of
religious
belief
is
that
which
holds
that
there
is
nothing
but
god
all
else
is
illusion
of
pantheistic
idealism
buddhism
at
least
in
its
original
form
discarded
the
idea
of
a
supreme
being
and
held
that
ultimate
reality
is
but
universal
hence
the
accusation
that
buddhism
is
an
atheistic
religion
although
it
is
one
of
the
world
greatest
religions
having
over
followers
but
the
of
the
religious
person
may
be
considered
as
resulting
from
intellectual
processes
his
religious
and
arise
from
another
part
of
his
mental
being
it
is
the
testimony
of
the
authorities
of
all
religions
that
religious
conviction
is
an
inner
experience
rather
than
an
intellectual
conception
the
emotional
element
is
always
active
in
religious
manifestations
everywhere
the
purely
intellectual
religion
is
naught
but
a
philosophy
religion
without
feeling
and
emotion
is
an
anomaly
in
all
true
religion
there
exists
a
feeling
of
inner
assurance
and
faith
love
awe
dependence
submission
reverence
gratitude
hope
and
perhaps
fear
the
emotional
element
must
always
be
present
not
necessarily
in
the
form
of
emotional
excess
as
in
the
case
of
revival
hysteria
or
the
dance
of
the
whirling
dervishes
but
at
least
in
the
form
of
the
calm
fervent
feeling
of
that
peace
which
passeth
understanding
when
religion
departs
from
the
emotional
phase
it
becomes
merely
a
school
of
philosophy
or
an
ethical
culture
society
the
student
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
uplifting
influence
of
true
religious
emotion
by
reason
of
his
knowledge
of
its
lowly
origin
like
the
lotus
which
has
its
roots
in
the
slimy
filthy
mud
of
the
river
and
its
stem
in
the
muddy
stagnant
and
foul
waters
thereof
but
its
beautiful
flower
unfolded
in
the
clear
air
and
facing
the
sun
so
is
religious
feeling
responsible
for
some
of
the
most
beautiful
and
uplifting
ideals
and
actions
of
the
race
if
its
origin
and
history
contain
much
that
is
not
consistent
with
the
highest
ideals
of
the
race
it
is
not
the
fault
of
religion
but
of
the
race
itself
religion
like
all
else
in
the
universal
manifestation
is
under
the
laws
of
evolution
growth
and
development
what
the
religion
of
the
future
may
be
we
know
not
but
the
prophets
of
the
race
are
dreaming
visions
of
a
religion
as
much
higher
than
that
of
as
the
latter
is
higher
than
the
crude
fetichism
of
the
savage
the
following
quotation
from
john
fiske
through
nature
to
god
is
appropriate
in
this
place
fiske
says
my
aim
is
to
show
that
other
influence
that
inward
conviction
the
craving
for
a
final
cause
the
theistic
assumption
is
itself
one
of
the
master
facts
of
the
universe
and
as
much
entitled
to
respect
as
any
fact
in
physical
nature
can
possibly
be
the
argument
flashed
upon
me
about
ten
years
ago
while
reading
herbert
spencer
controversy
with
frederic
harrison
concerning
the
nature
and
reality
of
religion
because
spencer
derived
historically
the
greater
part
of
modern
belief
in
an
unseen
world
from
the
primeval
world
of
dreams
and
ghosts
some
of
his
critics
maintained
that
logical
consistency
required
him
to
dismiss
the
modern
belief
as
utterly
false
otherwise
he
would
be
guilty
of
seeking
to
evolve
truth
from
falsehood
no
means
replied
spencer
the
ultimate
form
of
the
religious
consciousness
is
the
final
development
of
a
consciousness
which
at
the
outset
contained
a
germ
of
truth
obscured
by
multitudinous
errors
fiske
in
this
connection
quotes
the
tennysonian
question
forged
that
other
influence
that
heat
of
inward
evidence
by
which
he
doubts
against
the
sense
the
religious
emotions
may
be
developed
by
allowing
the
mind
to
dwell
upon
the
power
underlying
the
universe
of
fleeting
changing
forms
by
reading
prose
and
poetry
in
which
an
appeal
is
made
to
the
religious
instinct
by
listening
to
music
which
awakens
the
emotion
of
reverence
and
awe
and
finally
by
meditating
upon
the
inner
spirit
immanent
in
every
living
being
as
an
old
hindu
sage
once
said
there
are
many
paths
by
which
men
arrive
at
a
knowledge
of
the
presence
of
god
but
there
is
but
one
goal
and
destination
chapter

the
aesthetic
emotions
by
the
Ã¦sthetic
emotions
is
meant
those
emotional
feelings
which
are
concerned
with
the
perception
of
beauty
or
taste
and
by
reason
of
which
we
like
or
dislike
certain
perceptions
of
sensory
impressions
in
order
to
get
a
clearer
idea
let
us
consider
what
is
meant
by
beauty
and
taste
beauty
is
defined
as
that
quality
or
assemblage
of
qualities
in
an
object
which
gives
the
eye
or
the
ear
intense
pleasure
or
that
characteristic
in
an
object
which
gratifies
the
intellect
or
moral
feeling
taste
in
this
sense
of
the
term
is
defined
as
nice
perception
or
the
power
of
perceiving
and
relishing
excellence
in
human
performances
the
power
of
appreciating
the
finer
qualities
of
art
the
faculty
of
discerning
beauty
order
congruity
proportion
symmetry
or
whatever
constitutes
excellence
particularly
in
the
fine
arts
or
literature
the
faculty
of
the
mind
by
which
we
both
perceive
and
enjoy
whatever
is
beautiful
or
sublime
in
the
works
of
nature
and
art
the
possession
of
taste
insures
grace
and
beauty
in
the
works
of
an
artist
and
the
avoidance
of
all
that
is
low
or
mean
it
is
as
often
the
result
of
an
innate
sense
of
beauty
or
propriety
as
of
art
education
and
no
genius
can
compensate
for
the
want
of
it
tastes
differ
so
much
among
individuals
nations
or
in
different
ages
and
conditions
of
civilization
that
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
set
up
a
standard
of
taste
applicable
to
all
men
and
to
all
stages
in
the
evolution
of
society
the
Ã¦sthetic
sense
feeling
and
emotion
are
products
of
the
later
stages
of
the
evolution
of
the
mind
of
man
their
roots
however
may
be
seen
in
the
crude
attempts
at
decoration
and
adornment
in
the
savage
and
still
further
back
in
the
tendency
of
certain
birds
to
adorn
their
nests
or
bowers
moreover
some
sense
of
beauty
must
exist
in
the
lower
animals
which
are
influenced
thereby
in
the
selection
of
their
mates
the
bright
plumage
of
the
birds
and
the
coloring
of
the
insects
and
higher
animals
evidencing
the
existence
of
at
least
a
primitive
Ã¦sthetic
sense
herbert
spencer
says
that
one
characteristic
of
the
Ã¦sthetic
feelings
is
that
they
are
separated
from
the
functions
vitally
requisite
and
necessary
to
sustain
life
and
it
is
not
until
the
latter
are
reasonably
well
satisfied
that
the
former
begin
to
manifest
in
force
the
authorities
hold
that
the
basic
element
concerned
in
the
manifestation
of
the
Ã¦sthetic
emotional
feeling
is
the
element
which
consists
of
the
pleasure
arising
from
the
perception
of
objects
of
vision
or
hearing
which
are
deemed
beautiful
there
is
a
certain
nervous
satisfaction
which
arises
from
the
perception
of
the
sensation
of
the
sight
of
a
beautiful
thing
or
of
the
hearing
of
beautiful
sound
just
certain
sights
prove
agreeable
and
others
disagreeable
or
certain
sounds
pleasant
and
others
unpleasant
is
very
difficult
to
determine
association
and
habit
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
beauty
of
sight
object
and
there
may
be
natural
harmony
of
vibration
in
colors
as
there
is
in
sound
in
the
case
of
sounds
there
is
undoubtedly
a
natural
harmony
between
the
vibrations
of
certain
notes
of
the
scale
and
inharmony
between
others
some
have
held
that
the
secret
of
the
enjoyment
of
music
is
found
in
the
natural
appreciation
of
rhythm
as
rhythm
is
a
cosmic
manifestation
evident
in
everything
from
great
to
small
but
these
theories
do
not
account
for
the
differences
existing
in
the
tastes
regarding
color
and
music
manifested
by
different
individuals
races
and
classes
of
people
grant
allen
says
the
vulgar
are
pleased
with
great
masses
of
color
especially
red
orange
and
purple
which
give
their
coarse
nervous
organization
the
requisite
stimulus
the
refined
with
nerves
of
less
caliber
but
greater
discriminativeness
require
delicate
combinations
of
complementaries
and
prefer
neutral
tints
to
the
glare
of
the
primary
hues
children
and
savages
love
to
dress
in
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
in
the
same
way
persons
of
certain
types
of
taste
are
pleased
with
rag
time
and
cheap
rollicking
songs
or
dances
while
others
shudder
at
these
and
find
delight
in
the
classic
productions
of
the
great
composers
there
is
also
the
element
to
be
reckoned
with
in
the
Ã¦sthetic
emotions
the
intellect
must
discover
the
beauty
in
certain
objects
before
the
emotion
is
aroused
by
the
perception
halleck
says
every
time
the
mind
discerns
unity
amid
variety
order
rhythm
proportion
or
symmetry
an
Ã¦sthetic
emotion
arises
the
traveler
with
a
trained
intellect
will
see
far
more
beauty
than
an
ignorant
one
in
looking
at
a
cathedral
a
large
part
of
the
Ã¦sthetic
enjoyment
comes
from
tracing
out
the
symmetry
from
comparing
part
with
part
not
until
this
process
is
complete
will
the
full
beauty
of
the
structure
as
a
whole
be
perceived
if
the
traveler
knows
something
of
mediÃ¦val
architecture
before
starting
on
his
european
trip
he
will
see
far
more
beauty
the
opposite
of
the
Ã¦sthetic
which
we
call
the
ugly
is
the
unsymmetrical
the
disorderly
that
in
which
we
can
discover
no
rhythm
plan
or
beauty
the
element
of
also
enters
into
the
manifestation
of
Ã¦sthetic
emotional
feeling
the
mind
accepts
the
suggestion
of
the
beauty
of
certain
styles
of
art
or
the
excellence
of
certain
classes
of
music
there
are
fashions
in
art
and
music
as
in
clothes
and
what
is
thought
beautiful
may
be
deemed
hideous
this
is
not
entirely
due
to
the
evolution
of
taste
for
in
many
cases
the
old
fashions
are
revived
and
again
deemed
beautiful
there
is
moreover
the
effect
of
the
association
of
the
object
of
emotion
with
certain
events
or
persons
this
association
renders
the
thing
popular
and
therefore
agreeable
and
beautiful
for
the
time
being
the
suggestion
in
a
story
will
often
cause
the
beauty
of
a
certain
scene
or
the
harmony
of
a
certain
piece
of
music
to
dawn
upon
thousands
of
persons
some
noted
person
sets
the
seal
of
approval
upon
a
certain
picture
or
musical
composition
and
lo
the
multitude
calls
it
beautiful
it
must
not
be
supposed
however
that
the
crowd
always
counterfeits
this
sense
of
beauty
and
excellence
which
has
been
suggested
to
it
on
the
contrary
genuine
Ã¦sthetic
feeling
often
results
from
the
discovery
so
made
there
is
style
and
fashion
in
the
use
of
words
resulting
from
fashion
which
gives
rise
to
Ã¦sthetic
feelings
regarding
them
these
feelings
do
not
arise
from
the
consideration
of
the
nature
of
the
object
expressed
by
the
word
of
two
words
designating
the
same
thing
one
causes
disgust
and
the
other
at
least
passive
tolerance
for
instance
in
speaking
of
the
sensible
moisture
which
is
emitted
from
the
pores
of
the
skin
we
may
use
either
of
the
respective
terms
sweat
or
perspiration
both
mean
the
same
thing
and
have
an
equally
respectable
origin
but
to
many
persons
the
word
sweat
causes
unpleasant
Ã¦sthetic
emotion
while
the
word
perspiration
is
accepted
without
remonstrance
some
persons
abhor
the
term
victuals
while
viands
or
food
are
accepted
without
protest
there
is
often
an
unpleasant
low
vulgar
association
connected
with
some
words
which
accounts
for
the
disfavor
with
which
they
are
received
and
which
association
is
absent
from
the
more
polite
terms
employed
to
indicate
the
same
thing
but
in
other
cases
there
is
nothing
but
the
simple
suggestion
of
fashion
and
style
to
account
for
the
Ã¦sthetic
acceptance
or
rejection
it
is
possible
that
some
psychologist
of
the
future
will
establish
the
truth
of
the
theory
now
tentatively
advanced
by
a
few
investigators
namely
that
taste
and
the
sense
of
beauty
depend
almost
entirely
upon
the
element
of
suggestion
manifested
as
association
influence
of
authority
habit
fashion
imitation
etc
it
is
known
that
the
emotional
nature
is
peculiarly
liable
to
suggestion
and
that
tastes
may
be
created
or
destroyed
by
repeated
suggestion
under
the
most
favorable
circumstances
it
is
thought
likely
that
if
we
could
trace
back
to
its
roots
every
emotion
of
taste
we
would
find
it
arising
from
some
associative
suggestive
influence
connected
with
another
and
more
elemental
class
of
emotions
regarding
the
fact
that
there
is
no
universal
standard
of
taste
or
beauty
halleck
says
it
has
been
said
that
Ã¦sthetics
can
not
be
treated
in
a
scientific
way
because
there
is
no
standard
of
taste
gustibus
non
est
is
no
disputing
about
tastes
is
an
old
proverb
of
two
equally
intelligent
persons
the
one
may
like
a
certain
book
the
other
dislike
it
while
it
is
true
that
the
standard
of
taste
is
a
varying
one
within
certain
limits
it
is
no
more
so
than
that
of
morals
as
men
nervous
systems
education
and
associations
differ
we
may
scientifically
conclude
that
their
tastes
must
differ
the
greater
the
uniformity
in
the
factors
the
less
does
the
product
vary
on
the
other
hand
within
certain
limits
the
standard
of
Ã¦sthetics
is
relatively
uniform
is
fixed
by
the
majority
of

the
intellectual
emotions
by
the
intellectual
emotions
is
meant
that
class
of
emotional
feeling
resulting
from
the
presence
of
objects
of
intellectual
interest
this
class
of
emotions
depends
for
its
satisfaction
upon
the
exercise
of
the
intellectual
faculties
from
the
most
simple
to
the
most
complex
and
including
perception
memory
imagination
reason
judgment
and
all
the
logical
faculties
those
who
are
accustomed
to
employing
the
mind
through
voluntary
attention
particularly
in
the
direction
of
creative
ideation
or
constructive
imagination
experience
these
emotions
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
the
exercise
of
perception
if
we
are
skilled
therein
gives
us
a
pleasurable
feeling
and
if
we
succeed
in
making
an
interesting
or
important
discovery
by
reason
thereof
we
experience
a
strong
degree
of
emotional
satisfaction
likewise
we
experience
agreeable
feelings
when
we
are
able
to
remember
distinctly
something
which
might
well
have
been
forgotten
or
when
we
succeed
in
recalling
something
which
had
escaped
our
memory
for
the
moment
in
the
same
way
the
exercise
of
the
imagination
is
a
source
of
great
pleasure
in
many
cases
in
the
direction
of
writing
planning
inventing
or
other
creative
processes
or
even
in
the
building
of
air
castles
the
exercise
of
the
logical
faculties
gives
great
pleasure
to
those
in
whom
these
faculties
are
well
developed

says
there
was
probably
not
a
happier
moment
in
life
than
when
he
had
succeeded
in
demonstrating
that
the
same
power
which
caused
the
apple
to
fall
held
the
moon
and
the
planets
in
their
orbits
when
watts
discovered
that
steam
might
be
harnessed
like
a
horse
when
an
inventor
succeeds
in
perfecting
a
device
whenever
an
obscurity
is
cleared
away
the
reason
for
a
thing

and
a
baffling
instance
brought
under
a
general
law
intellectual
emotion
results
the
pleasurable
feelings
we
experience
upon
the
reading
of
a
good
book
or
the
discovery
of
real
poetry
are
forms
of
intellectual
emotion
the
same
class
of
emotional
feeling
is
aroused
when
we
witness
a
good
play
among
other
instances
of
this
class
we
mention
the
perception
of
clever
work
of
any
kind
intricate
machinery
ingenious
devices
helpful
improvements
or
other
works
of
man
which
indicate
the
existence
of
thought
and
inventive
ability
in
the
designer
or
builder
to
appreciate
mental
work
of
this
kind
we
must
bring
a
mind
developed
along
the
same
or
similar
lines
it
has
well
been
said
that
before
one
can
take
away
anything
from
a
book
he
must
bring
something
to
it
it
takes
mentality
to
recognize
and
appreciate
mentality
or
the
work
of
mentality
the
study
of
scientific
subjects
is
a
source
of
great
pleasure
to
those
who
are
inclined
to
such
pursuits
to
the
scientific
mind
the
study
of
the
latest
work
on
the
favorite
branch
gives
a
joy
which
nothing
else
is
capable
of
arousing
to
the
philosopher
the
works
of
other
philosophers
of
the
same
school
give
intense
satisfaction
it
is
claimed
that
the
sense
of
humor
and
wit
is
an
intellectual
emotion
for
it
depends
upon
the
detection
of
the
ludicrous
features
of
a
happening
certain
psychologists
have
held
that
the
distinctive
element
of
humor
is
the
feeling
attendant
upon
the
perception
of
incongruity
while
that
of
wit
is
the
feeling
of
superiority
on
the
part
of
the
witty
person
and
the
corresponding
chagrin
of
the
object
of
his
wit
it
would
seem
however
that
the
appreciation
of
wit
must
depend
upon
the
intellectual
perception
of
cleverness
of
expression
and
the
pleasure
resulting
from
the
discovery
thereof
and
that
the
feeling
of
humor
is
aroused
principally
by
reason
of
the
incongruous
element
the
feeling
of
as
contrasted
with
the
discomfiture
of
the
other
person
belongs
to
the
more
selfish
emotions
an
authority
says
humor
is
a
mental
faculty
which
tends
to
discover
incongruous
resemblances
between
things
which
essentially
differ
or
essential
differences
between
things
put
forth
as
the
same
the
result
being
internal
mirth
or
an
outburst
of
laughter
wit
does
so
likewise
but
the
two
are
different
humor
has
deep
human
sympathy
and
loves
men
while
raising
a
laugh
against
their
weaknesses
wit
is
deficient
in
sympathy
and
there
is
often
a
sting
in
its
ridicule
somewhat
contemptuous
of
mankind
it
has
not
the
patience
to
study
them
thoroughly
but
must
content
itself
with
noting
superficial
resemblances
or
differences
humor
is
patient
and
keenly
observant
and
penetrates
beneath
the
surface
while
therefore
the
sallies
of
wit
are
often
and
unfair
those
of
humor
are
as
a
rule
just
and
wise
the
development
and
cultivation
of
the
intellectual
emotions
depend
of
course
upon
education
training
exercise
and
practice
the
cultivation
of
the
intellect
which
has
been
referred
to
in
part
in
the
previous
parts
of
this
book
and
which
will
be
again
considered
in
the
chapters
devoted
to
the
intellect
results
in
the
development
and
cultivation
of
the
emotions
accompanying
intellectual
effort
in
a
general
way
however
it
may
be
said
that
the
reading
of
the
best
works
of
fiction
science
and
philosophy
will
bring
out
in
time
the
best
form
of
intellectual
enjoyment
and
feeling
the
highest
gives
the
best
that
is
the
rule
the
present
chapter
should
be
read
and
studied
in
connection
with
those
devoted
to
the
intellect
blended
emotions
as
we
have
said
at
the
beginning
of
our
consideration
of
the
subject
of
the
emotions
the
majority
of
emotions
are
composed
of
several
feelings
and
tend
to
blend
and
combine
emotional
elements
for
instance
the
emotion
of
sexual
love
certainly
has
its
origin
in
the
instinctive
feelings
of
the
race
and
its
motive
element
is
that
of
passion
but
passion
is
far
from
being
all
there
is
in
human
sexual
love
above
the
plane
of
passion
is
found
the
social
emotion
of
companionship
protection
and
care
the
desire
for
the
welfare
of
the
loved
one
the
mingling
of
the
love
of
the
parent
with
that
of
the
mate
human
love
manifests
many
of
the
altruistic
emotions
during
its
course
the
welfare
of
the
loved
one
becomes
the
chief
concern
of
life
often
stronger
even
than
the
joy
of
the
loved
one
becomes
the
greatest
joy
far
surpassing
the
more
selfish
forms
of
happiness
then
come
the
Ã¦sthetic
feelings
which
find
satisfaction
in
the
two
liking
the
same
things
sympathy
and
community
of
feeling
being
the
connecting
link
the
several
ideals
of
the
two
combining
there
is
produced
an
idealistic
union
which
is
often
called
spiritual
harmony
finally
there
is
found
the
blending
of
the
intellectual
emotions
in
which
harmony
there
exists
one
of
the
highest
forms
of
pleasure
satisfaction
between
two
persons
of
opposite
sexes
it
is
said
that
the
more
things
that
a
man
and
woman
like
in
common
the
closer
will
be
their
liking
for
each
other
i
love
you
because
you
love
the
things
i
love
is
no
rare
thought
and
expression
so
it
is
seen
that
though
born
in
elemental
instinct
and
passion
human
sexual
love
is
something
far
different
in
its
flowering
and
yet
without
its
root
it
would
not
be
and
can
not
be
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
complex
nature
of
the
most
common
emotions
it
may
be
used
as
a
typical
illustration
what
is
true
of
it
is
also
true
in
a
way
and
in
a
degree
of
every
other
form
of
emotion
therefore
in
studying
a
particular
emotion
be
not
too
quick
to
cry
it
is
this
it
is
that
but
rather
seek
to
say
it
is
composed
of
this
and
that
of
this
and
that
few
if
any
emotions
are
simple
the
majority
are
very
complex
hence
the
difficulty
of
satisfactory
classification
and
the
danger
of
dogmatic
definition
chapter

the
role
of
the
emotions
the
average
person
greatly
underestimates
the
part
played
by
the
emotional
nature
in
the
mental
activities
of
the
individual
he
is
inclined
to
the
opinion
that
with
the
exception
of
the
occasional
manifestation
of
some
strong
emotional
feeling
the
majority
of
persons
go
through
life
using
only
the
reasoning
and
reflective
faculties
in
deciding
the
problems
of
life
and
guiding
the
mental
course
of
action
there
can
be
no
greater
mistake
concerning
the
mental
activities
so
far
from
being
subordinate
to
the
intellect
the
emotional
nature
in
the
majority
of
cases
dominates
the
reasoning
faculties
there
are
but
very
few
persons
who
are
able
to
detach
themselves
even
in
a
small
degree
from
the
feelings
and
to
decide
questions
by
pure
reason
or
intellectual
effort
moreover
there
are
but
few
persons
whose
wills
are
guided
by
pure
reason
the
feelings
supply
the
motive
for
the
majority
of
acts
of
will
the
intellect
even
when
used
is
generally
employed
to
better
carry
out
the
dictates
of
feeling
and
desire
much
of
our
reasoning
is
performed
in
order
to
justify
our
feelings
or
to
find
proofs
for
the
position
dictated
by
our
desires
feelings
sympathies
prejudices
or
sentiments
it
has
been
said
that
men
seek
not
reasons
but
for
their
moreover
in
the
elementary
processes
of
the
intellect
the
emotions
play
an
important
part
we
have
seen
that
attention
largely
follows
interest
and
interest
results
from
feeling
therefore
our
attention
and
that
which
arises
from
it
is
dependent
largely
upon
the
feelings
thus
feeling
asserts
its
power
in
guarding
the
very
outer
gate
of
knowledge
and
determines
largely
what
shall
or
shall
not
enter
therein
it
is
one
of
the
paradoxes
of
psychology
that
while
feelings
have
originally
arisen
from
attention
it
is
equally
true
that
attention
depends
largely
upon
the
interest
resulting
from
the
feelings
this
is
readily
admitted
in
the
case
of
involuntary
attention
which
always
goes
out
toward
objects
of
interest
and
feeling
but
is
likewise
true
of
even
voluntary
attention
which
we
direct
to
something
of
greater
or
more
nearly
ultimate
interest
than
the
things
of
lesser
or
more
immediate
interest
sully
says
by
an
act
of
will
i
may
resolve
to
turn
my
attention
to
something
say
a
passage
in
a
book
but
if
after
the
preliminary
process
of
adjustment
of
the
mental
eye
the
object
opens
up
no
interesting
phase
all
the
willing
in
the
world
will
not
produce
a
calm
settled
state
of
concentration
the
will
introduces
mind
and
object
it
can
not
force
an
attachment
between
them
no
compulsion
of
attention
ever
succeeded
in
making
a
young
child
cordially
embrace
and
appropriate
by
an
act
of
concentration
an
unsuitable
and
therefore
uninteresting
object
we
thus
see
that
even
voluntary
interest
is
not
removed
from
the
sway
of
interest
what
the
will
is
to
determine
kind
of
that
shall
prevail
at
the
moment
again
we
may
see
that
memory
is
largely
dependent
upon
interest
in
recording
and
recalling
its
impressions
we
remember
and
recall
most
easily
that
which
most
greatly
interests
us
in
proportion
to
the
lack
of
interest
in
a
thing
do
we
find
difficulty
in
remembering
or
recalling
it
this
is
equally
true
of
the
imagination
for
it
refuses
to
dwell
upon
that
which
is
interesting
even
in
the
reasoning
processes
we
find
the
will
balking
at
uninteresting
subjects
but
galloping
along
pushing
before
it
the
rolling
chair
of
interesting
intellectual
application
our
judgments
are
affected
by
our
feelings
it
is
much
easier
to
approve
of
the
actions
of
some
person
we
like
or
whose
views
accord
with
our
own
than
of
an
individual
whose
personality
and
views
are
distasteful
to
us
it
is
very
difficult
to
prevent
prejudice
for
or
against
from
influencing
our
judgments
it
is
also
true
that
we
find
that
for
which
we
look
in
things
and
persons
and
that
which
we
expect
and
look
for
is
often
dependent
upon
our
feelings
if
we
dislike
a
person
or
thing
we
are
usually
able
to
perceive
no
end
of
undesirable
things
in
him
or
it
while
if
we
are
favorably
inclined
we
easily
find
many
admirable
qualities
in
the
same
person
or
thing
a
little
change
in
our
feeling
often
results
in
the
formation
of
an
entirely
new
set
of
judgments
regarding
a
person
or
thing
halleck
well
says
on
the
one
hand
the
emotions
are
favorable
to
intellectual
action
since
they
supply
the
interest
one
feels
in
study
one
may
feel
intensely
concerning
a
certain
subject
and
be
all
the
better
student
hence
the
emotions
are
not
as
was
formerly
thought
entirely
hostile
to
intellectual
action
emotion
often
quickens
the
perception
burns
things
indelibly
into
the
memory
and
doubles
the
rapidity
of
thought
on
the
other
hand
strong
feelings
often
vitiate
every
operation
of
the
intellect
they
cause
us
to
see
only
what
we
wish
to
to
remember
only
what
interests
our
narrow
feeling
at
the
time
and
to
reason
from
selfish
data
only
emotion
puts
the
magnifying
end
of
the
telescope
to
our
intellectual
eyes
where
our
own
interests
are
concerned
the
minimizing
end
when
we
are
looking
at
the
interest
of
others
deflected
when
it
passes
through
an
emotional
medium
just
as
a
sunbeam
is
when
it
strikes
as
for
the
will
the
best
authorities
hold
that
it
is
almost
if
not
entirely
dependent
upon
desire
for
its
motive
force
as
desire
is
an
outgrowth
and
development
of
feeling
and
emotion
it
is
seen
that
even
the
will
depends
upon
feeling
for
its
inciting
motives
and
its
direction
we
shall
consider
this
point
at
greater
detail
in
the
chapters
devoted
to
the
activities
of
the
will
we
would
remind
you
again
at
this
point
of
the
great
triangle
of
the
mind
the
emotional
ideative
and
volitional
activities
feeling
thinking
and
willing
and
their
constant
reaction
upon
each
other
and
absolute
interdependence
we
find
that
our
feelings
arise
from
previous
willing
and
ideation
and
are
aroused
by
ideas
and
repressed
by
will
again
we
see
that
our
ideas
are
largely
dependent
upon
the
interest
supplied
by
our
feelings
and
that
our
judgments
are
influenced
by
the
emotive
side
of
our
mental
life
the
will
also
having
its
part
to
play
in
the
matter
we
also
see
that
the
will
is
called
into
activity
by
the
feelings
and
often
guided
or
restrained
by
our
thoughts
the
will
indeed
being
considered
as
moved
entirely
by
our
feelings
and
ideas
thus
is
the
trinity
of
mental
forces
seen
ever
in
mutual
relation
constant
action
and
reaction
ever
existing
between
them
chapter

the
emotions
and
happiness
happiness
has
been
defined
by
an
authority
as
the
pleasurable
emotion
arising
from
the
gratification
of
all
desires
the
enjoyment
of
pleasure
without
pain
another
has
said
that
happiness
is
the
state
in
which
all
desires
are
satisfied
but
these
definitions
have
been
attacked
it
is
held
by
many
that
a
state
of
the
absolute
of
desire
would
not
be
happiness
for
happiness
consists
largely
in
pleasurable
anticipation
and
imaginings
which
disappear
upon
the
realization
of
the
desire
it
is
held
that
absolute
satisfaction
would
be
a
negative
state

better
idea
when
he
said
that
any
condition
may
be
denominated
in
which
the
amount
or
aggregate
of
pleasure
exceeds
that
of
pain
and
the
degree
of
happiness
depends
upon
the
quantity
of
this
excess
some
have
held
that
an
existing
contrast
between
pain
and
pleasure
the
balance
being
in
favor
of
the
latter
is
necessary
to
establish
happiness
be
this
as
it
may
it
is
admitted
by
all
that
one
happiness
or
unhappiness
depends
entirely
upon
one
emotional
nature
and
the
degree
of
the
satisfaction
thereof
and
it
is
generally
admitted
that
to
be
happy
is
the
great
aim
and
object
of
the
life
of
the
majority
of
persons
if
indeed
not
of
person
the
happiness
of
course
depending
upon
the
quality
and
degree
of
the
emotions
forming
the
person
emotional
nature
thus
it
is
seen
that
we
are
dependent
upon
the
emotional
side
of
our
mental
life
in
this
as
in
nearly
everything
else
making
life
worth
while
theologians
have
often
sought
to
point
out
that
happiness
is
not
the
goal
of
life
and
living
but
human
nature
has
always
insisted
that
happiness
is
the
greatest
end
and
philosophy
has
generally
supported
it
but
wisdom
shows
that
happiness
is
not
always
dependent
upon
the
pleasure
of
the
moment
for
the
sacrifice
of
immediate
pleasure
frequently
results
in
a
much
greater
happiness
in
the
future
in
the
same
way
an
immediate
disagreeable
task
often
gains
for
us
a
greater
satisfaction
in
the
future
likewise
it
is
frequently
greater
happiness
to
sacrifice
a
personal
pleasure
for
the
happiness
of
others
than
it
would
be
to
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
the
moment
at
the
expense
of
the
pain
of
the
other
there
is
often
a
far
greater
pleasure
resulting
from
an
altruistic
action
of
than
in
the
performance
of
the
selfish
egoistic
act
but
as
the
subtle
reasoner
may
insist
the
result
is
the
same
the
ultimate
happiness
and
satisfaction
of
the
self
this
conclusion
does
not
rob
the
altruistic
act
of
its
virtue
however
for
the
person
who
finds
his
greatest
pleasure
in
giving
pleasure
to
others
is
to
be
congratulated
as
is
the
community
which
shelters
him
there
is
no
virtue
in
pain
suffering
sacrifice
or
unhappiness
its
own
this
illusion
of
asceticism
is
vanishing
from
the
human
mind
sacrifice
on
the
part
of
the
individual
is
valuable
and
valid
only
when
it
results
in
higher
present
or
future
happiness
for
the
individual
or
some
one
else
there
is
no
virtue
in
pain
physical
or
mental
except
as
a
step
to
a
greater
good
for
ourselves
or
others
pain
at
the
best
is
merely
nature
alarm
and
warning
of
not
this
way
it
is
also
held
that
pain
serves
to
bring
out
pleasure
by
contrast
and
is
therefore
valuable
in
this
way
be
this
as
it
may
no
normal
individual
deliberately
seeks
ultimate
pain
in
preference
to
ultimate
happiness
the
greatest
ultimate
happiness
to
one
self
and
to
those
he
loves
is
the
normal
and
natural
goal
of
the
normal
person
but
the
concept
of
those
he
loves
in
many
cases
includes
the
race
as
well
as
the
immediate
family
wisdom
shows
the
individual
that
the
greatest
happiness
comes
to
him
who
controls
and
restrains
many
of
his
feelings
dissipation
results
in
pain
and
unhappiness
ultimately
the
doctrine
of
thoughtless
indulgence
is
unphilosophical
and
is
contradicted
by
the
experience
of
the
race
moreover
wisdom
shows
that
the
highest
happiness
comes
not
from
the
indulgence
of
the
physical
feelings
alone
or
to
excess
but
rather
from
the
cultivation
development
and
manifestation
of
the
higher
feelings
the
social
Ã¦sthetic
and
intellectual
emotions
the
higher
pleasures
of
life
literature
art
music
science
invention
constructive
imagination
yield
a
satisfaction
and
happiness
keener
and
more
enduring
than
can
possibly
the
lower
forms
of
feeling
but
the
human
being
must
not
despise
any
part
of
his
emotional
being
everything
has
its
uses
which
are
good
and
its
abuses
which
are
bad
every
part
of
one
being
mental
and
physical
is
well
to
use
but
no
part
is
well
used
if
it
uses
the
individual
instead
of
being
itself
used
a
recent
writer
has
held
that
the
end
and
aim
of
life
should
not
be
the
pursuit
of
happiness
but
rather
the
building
of
character
the
obvious
answer
is
that
the
two
are
identical
in
spirit
for
to
the
man
who
appreciates
the
value
of
character
its
attainment
is
the
greatest
happiness
the
wise
teach
that
the
greatest
happiness
comes
to
him
who
is
possessed
of
a
developed
character
another
writer
has
said
that
the
aim
of
life
should
be
with
a
due
regard
to
the
interest
of
others
this
is
but
saying
that
the
greatest
happiness
to
the
wise
man
lies
in
this
course
any
one
who
is
wise
enough
or
great
enough
to
make
these
ends
the
aim
and
goal
of
life
will
find
the
greatest
happiness
therefrom
arnold
bennett
advances
as
a
good
working
philosophy
of
life
cheerfulness
kindliness
and
rectitude
can
any
one
doubt
that
this
course
would
bring
great
ultimate
happiness
happiness
consists
in
that
which
contents
the
spirit
and
the
latter
depends
entirely
upon
the
character
of
the
feelings
and
emotions
entertained
by
one
as
weighed
in
the
balance
of
reason
and
as
passed
upon
by
judgment
and
the
sense
of
right
action
the
greatest
degree
of
happiness
or
at
least
the
greatest
ratio
of
pleasure
over
pain
is
obtained
by
a
careful
and
intelligent
cultivation
of
the
feeling
side
of
one
being
in
connection
with
the
cultivation
of
the
intellect
and
the
mastery
of
the
will
to
be
able
to
bring
the
capacity
for
enjoyment
to
its
highest
to
be
able
to
intelligently
choose
that
which
will
bring
the
greatest
ultimate
happiness
in
accordance
with
right
action
and
finally
to
be
able
to
use
the
will
in
the
direction
of
holding
fast
to
that
which
is
good
and
rejecting
that
which
is
bad
this
is
the
power
of
creating
happiness
the
feelings
the
intellect
and
the
will
here
as
ever
combine
to
manifest
the
result
finally
it
must
be
remembered
that
all
human
happiness
consists
in
part
of
the
ability
to
bear
pain
to
suffer
there
must
be
the
dash
of
stoicism
in
the
wise
epicurean
one
must
learn
to
pluck
from
pain
suffering
and
unhappiness
the
secret
drop
of
honey
which
lies
at
its
heart
and
which
consists
in
the
knowledge
of
the
meaning
and
use
of
pain
and
the
means
whereby
it
may
be
transmuted
into
knowledge
and
experience
from
which
later
happiness
may
be
distilled
to
profit
by
pain
to
transmute
suffering
into
joy
to
transform
present
unhappiness
into
a
future
greater
happiness
this
is
the
privilege
of
the
philosopher
the
mental
states
and
activities
known
as
desire
are
a
direct
development
of
the
feeling
and
emotional
phase
of
the
mind
and
form
the
motive
power
of
the
will
desire
in
fact
may
be
said
to
be
composed
of
feeling
on
one
side
and
will
on
the
other
but
the
influence
of
the
intellect
or
reasoning
faculties
has
a
most
important
part
to
play
in
the
evolution
of
feeling
into
desire
and
in
the
consequent
action
of
the
will
by
the
presentation
and
weighing
of
conflicting
desires
therefore
the
logical
place
for
the
consideration
of
the
activities
of
the
intellect
is
at
this
point
between
emotion
and
will
accordingly
we
shall
leave
the
subject
of
feeling
and
emotion
for
the
present
to
be
taken
up
again
in
connection
with
the
subject
of
after
we
have
considered
the
intellectual
processes
of
the
mind
but
as
has
been
indicated
we
shall
see
the
presence
and
influence
of
the
feelings
and
emotions
even
in
the
activities
of
the
intellect
chapter
xx
the
intellect
the
class
of
mental
states
or
processes
grouped
together
under
the
name
of
intellectual
processes
forms
the
second
great
division
of
the
mental
states
the
two
others
being
feeling
and
will
respectively
intellect
has
been
defined
as
follows
the
part
or
faculty
of
the
human
mind
by
which
it
knows
as
distinguished
from
the
power
to
feel
and
to
will
the
thinking
faculty
the
understanding
also
as
that
faculty
of
the
human
mind
by
which
it
receives
or
comprehends
the
ideas
communicated
to
it
by
the
senses
or
the
perception
or
other
means
as
distinguished
from
the
power
to
feel
and
to
will
the
power
or
faculty
to
perceive
objects
in
their
relations
the
power
to
judge
and
comprehend
also
the
capacity
for
higher
forms
of
knowledge
as
distinguished
from
the
power
to
perceive
and
imagine
in
the
preceding
chapters
we
have
seen
that
the
individual
is
able
to
experience
sensations
in
consciousness
and
that
he
is
able
to
them
mentally
the
latter
being
the
first
step
in
intellectual
activity
we
have
also
seen
that
he
is
able
to
reproduce
the
perception
by
means
of
memory
and
imagination
and
that
by
means
of
the
latter
he
is
able
to
and
rearrange
the
objects
of
perception
we
have
also
seen
that
he
has
what
are
known
as
feelings
which
depend
upon
his
previous
experience
and
that
of
his
progenitors
so
far
the
mind
has
been
considered
merely
as
a
receiving
and
reproducing
instrument
with
the
added
attachment
of
the
power
of
the
imagination
up
to
this
point
the
mind
may
be
compared
to
the
phonographic
cylinder
with
an
attachment
capable
of
its
recorded
impressions
the
impressions
are
received
and
perceived
are
stored
away
are
reproduced
and
by
the
use
of
the
imagination
are
up
to
this
point
the
mind
is
seen
to
be
more
or
less
of
an
automatic
instinctive
faculty
it
may
be
traced
from
the
purely
reflex
activity
of
the
lowest
forms
of
life
up
through
the
lower
animals
step
by
step
until
a
very
high
degree
of
mental
power
is
perceived
in
animals
like
the
horse
dog
or
elephant
but
there
is
something
lacking
there
is
missing
that
peculiar
power
of
thinking
in
symbols
and
abstract
conceptions
which
distinguishes
the
human
race
and
which
is
closely
bound
up
with
the
faculty
of
language
or
expressing
thoughts
in
words
the
comparatively
high
mental
process
of
the
lower
animals
is
dwarfed
by
the
human
faculty
of
thinking
and
is
the
manifestation
of
the
intellect
what
is
it
to
strange
to
say
very
few
persons
can
answer
this
question
correctly
at
first
they
find
themselves
inclined
to
answer
the
inquiry
in
the
words
of
the
child
why
to
think
is
to
let
us
see
if
we
can
make
it
plain
the
dictionary
definition
is
a
little
too
technical
to
be
of
much
use
to
the
beginner
but
here
it
is
to
employ
any
of
the
intellectual
powers
except
that
of
simple
perception
through
the
senses
but
what
are
the
intellectual
powers
so
employed
and
how
are
they
employed
let
us
see
stating
the
matter
plainly
in
common
terms
we
may
say
that
thinking
is
the
mental
process
of
comparing
our
perceptions
of
things
with
each
other
noting
the
points
of
likeness
and
of
difference
classifying
them
according
to
the
ascertained
likeness
or
difference
and
thus
tying
them
up
in
mental
bundles
with
each
set
of
things
of
a
kind
in
its
own
bundle
forming
the
abstract
symbolic
mental
idea
concept
of
each
class
of
things
so
grouped
which
we
may
afterward
use
as
we
use
figures
in
mathematical
calculations
using
these
concepts
in
order
to
form
that
is
to
reason
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
and
to
form
judgments
regarding
things
comparing
these
judgments
and
deducing
higher
judgments
from
them
and
so
on
without
thinking
man
would
be
dependent
upon
each
particular
experience
for
his
knowledge
except
so
far
as
memory
and
imagination
could
instinctively
aid
him
by
thought
processes
he
is
enabled
to
infer
that
if
certain
things
be
true
of
one
of
a
certain
kind
of
things
the
same
thing
may
be
expected
from
others
of
the
same
class
as
he
is
able
to
note
points
of
likeness
or
difference
he
is
able
to
form
clearer
and
truer
inferences
in
addition
he
is
able
to
apply
his
constructive
imagination
to
the
rearrangement
and
recombination
of
things
whose
nature
he
has
discovered
and
thus
progress
along
the
line
of
material
achievement
as
well
as
of
knowledge
it
must
be
remembered
however
that
the
intellect
depends
entirely
for
its
material
upon
the
perception
which
in
turn
receives
its
raw
material
from
the
senses
the
intellect
merely
groups
together
the
material
of
perception
makes
inferences
draws
conclusions
from
and
forms
conclusions
regarding
them
and
in
the
case
of
constructive
imagination
recombines
them
in
effective
forms
and
arrangement
the
intellect
is
the
last
in
order
in
the
course
of
mental
evolution
it
appears
last
in
order
in
the
mind
of
the
child
but
it
often
persists
in
old
age
after
the
feelings
have
grown
dim
and
the
memory
weak
concepts
what
is
known
as
the
concept
is
the
first
fruit
of
the
elemental
processes
of
thought
the
various
images
of
outside
objects
are
sensed
then
perceived
and
then
grouped
according
to
their
likenesses
and
differences
and
the
result
is
the
production
of
concepts
it
is
difficult
to
define
a
concept
so
as
to
convey
any
meaning
to
the
beginner
for
instance
the
dictionaries
give
the
definition
as
an
abstract
general
conception
idea
or
notion
formed
in
the
mind
not
very
clear
this
is
it
perhaps
we
can
understand
it
better
if
we
say
that
the
terms
dog
cat
man
horse
house
each
expresses
a
concept
every
term
expresses
a
concept
every
general
name
of
a
thing
or
quality
is
a
term
applied
to
the
concept
we
shall
see
this
a
little
clearer
as
we
proceed
we
form
a
concept
in
this
way
we
a
number
of
things
then
we
notice
certain
possessed
by
things
certain
properties
attributes
or
characteristics
which
make
the
thing
what
it
is
then
we
these
qualities
of
the
thing
with
the
qualities
of
other
things
and
see
that
there
is
a
likeness
in
some
cases
in
various
degrees
and
a
difference
in
other
cases
in
various
degrees
then
we
or
the
perceived
things
according
to
their
ascertained
likenesses
and
differences
then
we
form
a
or
embodying
each
class
of
thing
and
finally
we
give
to
the
concept
a
or
which
is
its
symbol
the
concept
is
a
of
a
class
of
things
the
is
the
expression
of
that
general
idea
the
concept
is
the
idea
of
a
class
of
things
the
term
is
the
affixed
to
the
thing
to
illustrate
this
last
distinction
let
us
take
the
concept
and
term
of
bird
for
instance
by
perception
comparison
and
classification
of
the
qualities
of
living
things
we
have
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
there
exists
a
great
general
class
the
qualities
of
which
may
be
stated
thus
feathered
winged
oviparous
vertebrate
to
this
general
class
of
animals
we
apply
the
english
term
bird
the
name
is
merely
a
symbol
in
german
the
term
is
in
latin
but
in
each
and
every
case
the
or
above
stated
feathered
winged
oviparous
vertebrate
is
meant
if
anything
is
found
having
all
of
those
particular
qualities
then
we
know
it
must
be
what
we
call
a
bird
and
everything
that
we
call
a
bird
must
have
those
qualities
the
term
bird
is
the
symbol
for
that
particular
combination
of
qualities
existing
in
a
thing
there
is
a
difference
between
a
mental
image
of
the
imagination
and
a
concept
the
mental
image
must
always
be
of
a
thing
while
the
concept
is
always
an
idea
of
a
of
things
which
can
not
be
clearly
pictured
in
the
mind
for
instance
the
imagination
may
form
the
mental
picture
of
any
known
bird
or
even
of
an
imaginary
bird
but
that
bird
always
will
be
a
distinct
bird
try
to
form
a
mental
picture
of
the
general
class
of
birds
how
will
you
do
it
do
you
realize
the
difficulty
first
such
an
image
would
have
to
include
the
characteristics
of
the
large
birds
such
as
the
eagle
ostrich
and
condor
and
of
the
small
birds
such
as
the
wren
and
humming
bird
it
must
be
a
composite
of
the
shape
of
all
birds
from
the
ostrich
swan
eagle
crane
down
to
the
sparrow
swallow
and
humming
bird
it
must
picture
the
particular
qualities
of
birds
of
prey
water
birds
and
domestic
fowls
as
well
as
the
grain
eaters
it
must
exhibit
all
the
colors
found
in
bird
life
from
the
brightest
reds
and
greens
down
to
the
sober
grays
and
browns
a
little
thought
will
show
that
a
clear
mental
image
of
such
a
concept
is
impossible
what
the
most
of
us
do
when
we
think
of
bird
is
to
picture
a
vague
flying
shape
of
dull
color
but
when
we
stop
to
think
that
the
term
must
also
include
the
waddling
duck
and
the
scratching
barnyard
chicken
we
see
that
our
mental
image
is
faulty
the
trouble
is
that
the
term
bird
really
means
and
we
can
not
picture
an
from
the
very
nature
of
the
case
our
terms
therefore
are
like
mathematical
figures
or
algebraic
symbols
which
we
use
for
ease
speed
and
clearness
of
thinking
the
trouble
does
not
end
here
concepts
not
only
include
the
general
idea
of
but
also
the
general
idea
of
the
of
thus
sweetness
hardness
courage
and
energy
are
concepts
but
we
can
not
form
a
mental
image
of
them
by
themselves
we
may
picture
a
sweet
but
not
sweetness
itself
so
you
see
that
a
concept
is
a
purely
abstract
mental
idea
a
symbol
akin
to
the
figures
and
used
in
the
same
way
they
for
general
classes
of
things
a
term
is
the
verbal
and
written
expression
of
the
general
idea
or
concept
the
student
is
requested
to
fix
these
distinctions
in
his
mind
so
as
to
render
further
understanding
of
them
easy
chapter
xxi
conception
the
process
of
conception
has
been
well
defined
by
gordy
as
that
act
of
mind
by
which
it
forms
an
idea
of
a
class
or
that
act
of
the
mind
that
enables
us
to
use
general
names
intelligently
he
adds
it
is
of
course
understood
that
i
am
using
the
word
to
denote
an
indefinite
number
of
individuals
that
resemble
each
other
in
certain
particulars
perception
the
first
step
in
conception
as
we
have
seen
is
that
of
perception
it
is
readily
perceived
that
the
character
of
our
intellectual
processes
depends
materially
upon
the
variety
clearness
and
accuracy
of
our
perceptions
therefore
again
we
would
refer
our
students
to
the
chapter
in
which
we
have
stated
the
importance
of
clear
perception
memory
the
future
steps
of
conception
depend
materially
upon
the
clearness
of
the
memory
as
we
can
classify
objects
only
by
remembering
their
qualities
beyond
the
immediate
moment
of
actual
original
perception
therefore
the
memory
should
be
strengthened
for
this
as
well
as
other
objects
abstraction
the
second
step
in
conception
is
that
of
the
mental
abstraction
of
qualities
from
the
observed
thing
that
is
we
must
perceive
and
then
mentally
the
observed
qualities
of
the
thing
for
instance
man
first
perceived
the
existence
of
certain
qualities
in
things
he
found
that
a
certain
number
of
things
possessed
some
of
these
qualities
in
common
while
others
possessed
other
qualities
in
the
same
way
and
thus
arose
classification
from
comparison
but
both
comparison
and
classification
are
possible
only
by
abstraction
or
perception
of
the
quality
as
a
thing
thus
the
abstraction
of
the
idea
of
the
quality
of
from
the
idea
of
sugar
sweetness
is
a
rather
than
a
thing
itself
it
is
something
possessed
by
sugar
which
helps
to
make
sugar
what
it
is
color
shape
size
mental
qualities
habits
of
action
these
are
some
of
the
qualities
first
observed
in
things
and
abstracted
from
them
in
thought
redness
sweetness
hardness
softness
largeness
smallness
fragrance
swiftness
slowness
fierceness
gentleness
warmness
coldness
these
are
abstracted
qualities
of
things
of
course
these
qualities
are
really
never
divorced
from
things
but
the
mind
divorces
them
in
order
to
make
thinking
easier
an
authority
says
animals
are
incapable
of
making
abstractions
and
that
is
the
reason
why
they
can
not
develop
formal
thought
abstract
thought
is
identical
with
rational
thought
which
is
the
characteristic
feature
of
the
thought
of
speaking
beings
this
is
the
reason
why
abstract
thought
is
upon
earth
the
exclusive
property
of
man
and
why
brutes
are
incapable
of
abstract
thought
the
process
of
naming
is
the
mechanism
of
abstraction
for
names
establish
the
mental
independence
of
the
objects
named
the
processes
of
abstraction
depend
upon
attention
concentrated
attention
attention
directed
to
the
qualities
of
a
thing
tends
to
abstract
the
qualities
in
thought
from
the
thing
itself
mill
says
abstraction
is
primarily
the
result
of
attention
hamilton
says
attention
and
abstraction
are
only
the
same
process
viewed
in
different
relations
cultivation
of
the
power
of
abstraction
means
principally
cultivation
of
attention
any
mental
activity
which
tends
toward
or
separation
of
a
thing
into
its
parts
qualities
or
elements
will
serve
to
cultivate
and
develop
the
power
of
abstraction
the
habit
of
converting
into
concepts
is
acquired
by
adjective
terms
into
their
corresponding
noun
for
instance
a
piece
of
colored
candy
possesses
the
of
being
round
hard
red
sweet
etc
transforming
these
adjective
qualities
into
noun
terms
we
have
the
of
roundness
hardness
redness
and
sweetness
respectively
comparison
the
third
step
in
conception
is
that
of
in
which
the
qualities
of
several
things
are
compared
or
examined
for
likenesses
and
differences
we
find
many
qualities
in
which
the
several
things
differ
and
a
few
in
which
there
is
a
likeness
classes
are
formed
from
resemblances
or
likenesses
while
individuals
are
separated
from
apparent
classes
by
detection
of
differences
finally
it
is
found
that
separate
things
while
having
many
points
of
difference
which
indicate
their
individuality
nevertheless
have
a
few
points
of
likeness
which
indicate
that
they
belong
to
the
same
general
family
or
class
the
detection
of
likenesses
and
differences
in
the
qualities
of
various
things
is
an
important
mental
process
many
of
the
higher
thought
processes
depend
largely
upon
the
ability
to
compare
things
properly
the
development
of
attention
and
perception
tends
to
develop
the
power
of
comparison
classification
or
generalization
the
fourth
step
in
conception
is
that
of
classification
or
generalization
whereby
we
place
individual
things
in
a
mental
bundle
or
class
and
then
this
bundle
in
company
with
other
bundles
into
a
higher
class
and
so
on
thus
we
group
all
the
individual
small
birds
having
certain
characteristics
into
a
species
then
several
related
species
into
a
larger
family
and
this
into
a
still
larger
until
finally
we
group
all
the
bird
families
into
the
great
family
which
we
call
birds
and
of
which
the
simple
term
bird
expresses
the
general
concept
jevons
says
we
classify
things
together
whenever
we
observe
that
they
are
like
each
other
in
any
respect
and
therefore
think
of
them
together
in
classifying
a
collection
of
objects
we
do
not
merely
put
together
into
groups
those
which
resemble
each
other
but
we
also
divide
each
class
into
smaller
ones
in
which
the
resemblance
is
more
complete
thus
the
class
of
may
be
divided
into
those
which
are
solid
and
those
which
are
fluid
so
that
we
get
the
two
minor
classes
of
and
substances
it
is
desirable
to
have
names
by
which
to
show
that
one
class
is
contained
in
another
and
accordingly
we
call
the
class
which
is
divided
into
two
or
more
smaller
ones
the
and
the
smaller
ones
into
which
it
is
divided
the
every
is
a
small
family
of
the
individuals
composing
it
and
at
the
same
time
is
an
individual
species
of
the
genus
just
above
it
the
in
turn
is
a
family
of
several
species
and
at
the
same
time
an
individual
genus
in
the
greater
family
or
genus
above
it
the
student
may
familiarize
himself
with
the
idea
of
generalization
by
considering
himself
as
an
individual
john
smith
john
represents
that
unit
of
generalization
the
next
step
is
to
combine
john
with
the
other
smiths
of
his
immediate
family
then
this
family
may
be
grouped
with
his
near
blood
relations
and
so
on
until
finally
all
the
related
smiths
near
and
remote
are
grouped
together
in
a
great
smith
family
or
in
the
same
way
the
family
group
may
be
enlarged
until
it
takes
in
all
the
white
people
in
a
county
then
all
the
white
people
in
the
state
then
all
in
the
united
states
then
all
the
white
races
then
all
the
white
and
other
races
then
all
mankind
then
if
one
is
inclined
the
process
may
be
continued
until
it
embraces
every
living
creature
from
moneron
to
man
reversing
the
process
living
creatures
may
be
divided
and
subdivided
until
all
mankind
is
seen
to
stand
as
a
class
then
the
race
of
man
may
be
divided
into
according
to
color
then
the
white
race
may
be
subdivided
into
americans
and
then
the
americans
may
be
divided
into
inhabitants
of
the
several
states
or
into
indianans
and
then
into
the
inhabitants
of
the
several
counties
of
indiana
and
thus
the
posey
countians
are
reached
then
the
posey
county
people
are
divided
into
smiths
and
then
the
smith
family
into
its
constituent
family
groups
and
then
into
the
smaller
families
and
so
on
until
the
classification
reaches
one
particular
john
smith
who
at
last
is
found
to
be
an
individual
in
a
class
by
himself
this
is
the
story
of
the
ascending
and
descending
processes
of
generalization
chapter
xxii
classes
of
concepts
in
the
preceding
chapter
we
have
seen
the
process
of
conception
of
the
forming
of
concepts
idea
of
a
general
class
of
things
or
qualities
is
a
each
concept
contains
the
qualities
which
are
to
the
individuals
composing
the
class
but
not
those
qualities
which
pertain
only
to
the
minor
classes
or
the
individuals
for
instance
the
concept
of
bird
will
necessarily
include
the
common
qualities
of
featheredness
wingedness
oviparousness
and
vertebratedness
but
it
will
include
color
special
shape
size
or
special
features
or
characteristics
of
the
subfamilies
or
individuals
composing
the
great
class
the
class
comprises
the
individuals
and
subclasses
composing
it
the
concept
includes
the
general
and
common
qualities
which
in
the
class
possess
a
is
the
mental
image
of
a
particular
thing
a
is
the
mental
idea
of
the
general
qualities
of
a
class
of
things
a
percept
arises
from
the
perception
of
a
sensation
a
concept
is
a
purely
mental
abstract
creation
whose
only
existence
is
in
the
world
of
ideas
and
which
has
no
corresponding
individual
object
in
the
world
of
sense
there
are
two
general
classes
of
concepts
namely
concrete
concepts
in
which
the
common
qualities
of
a
class
of
things
are
combined
into
one
conceptual
idea
such
as
bird
of
which
we
have
spoken
abstract
concepts
in
which
is
combined
the
idea
of
some
common
to
a
number
of
things
such
as
sweetness
or
redness
jevons
rule
for
terms
is
an
aid
in
remembering
this
classification
concrete
term
is
the
name
of
a
thing
an
abstract
term
is
the
name
of
a
quality
of
a
it
is
a
peculiar
fact
and
rule
of
concrete
concepts
that
the
larger
the
class
of
things
embraced
in
a
concept
the
smaller
are
its
general
qualities
and
the
larger
the
number
of
general
qualities
included
in
a
concept
the
smaller
the
number
of
individuals
embraced
by
it
for
instance
the
term
bird
embraces
a
great
number
of
individuals
all
the
birds
that
are
in
existence
in
fact
but
it
has
but
few
general
qualities
as
we
have
seen
on
the
contrary
the
concept
stork
has
a
much
larger
number
of
general
qualities
but
embraces
far
fewer
individuals
finally
the
individual
is
reached
and
we
find
that
it
has
more
qualities
than
any
class
can
have
but
it
is
composed
of
the
smallest
possible
number
of
individuals
one
the
secret
is
this
no
two
individuals
can
have
as
many
qualities
as
each
has
individually
unless
they
are
precisely
alike
which
is
impossible
in
nature
imperfect
concepts
it
is
said
that
outside
of
strictly
scientific
definitions
very
few
persons
agree
in
their
concepts
of
the
same
thing
each
has
his
or
her
own
concept
of
the
particular
thing
which
he
or
she
expresses
by
the
same
term
a
number
of
persons
asked
to
define
a
common
term
like
love
religion
faith
belief
will
give
such
a
variety
of
answers
as
to
cause
wonderment
as
green
says
my
idea
or
image
is
mine
alone
the
reward
of
careless
observation
if
imperfect
of
attentive
careful
and
varied
observation
if
correct
between
mine
and
yours
a
great
gulf
is
fixed
no
man
can
pass
from
mine
to
yours
or
from
yours
to
mine
neither
in
any
proper
sense
of
the
term
can
mine
be
conveyed
to
you
words
do
not
convey
thoughts
they
are
not
vehicles
of
thoughts
in
any
true
sense
of
that
term
a
word
is
simply
a
common
symbol
which
each
associates
with
his
own
idea
or
image
the
reason
of
the
difference
in
the
concepts
of
several
persons
is
that
very
few
of
our
concepts
are
nearly
perfect
the
majority
of
them
are
quite
imperfect
and
incomplete
jevons
gives
us
an
idea
of
this
in
his
remarks
on
classification
things
may
seem
to
be
very
much
like
each
other
which
are
not
so
whales
porpoises
seals
and
several
other
animals
live
in
the
sea
exactly
like
a
fish
they
have
a
similar
shape
and
are
usually
classed
among
fish
people
are
said
to
go
whale
fishing
yet
these
animals
are
not
really
fish
at
all
but
are
much
more
like
dogs
and
horses
and
other
quadrupeds
than
they
are
like
fish
they
can
not
live
entirely
under
water
and
breathe
the
air
contained
in
the
water
like
fish
but
they
have
to
come
to
the
surface
at
intervals
to
take
breath
similarly
we
must
not
class
bats
with
birds
because
they
fly
about
although
they
have
what
would
be
called
wings
these
wings
are
not
like
those
of
birds
and
in
truth
bats
are
much
more
like
rats
and
mice
than
they
are
like
birds
botanists
used
at
one
time
to
classify
plants
according
to
their
size
as
trees
shrubs
or
herbs
but
we
now
know
that
a
great
tree
is
often
more
similar
in
character
to
a
tiny
herb
than
it
is
to
other
great
trees
a
daisy
has
little
resemblance
to
a
great
scotch
thistle
yet
the
botanist
regards
them
as
very
similar
the
lofty
growing
bamboo
is
a
kind
of
grass
and
the
sugar
cane
also
belongs
to
the
same
class
with
wheat
and
oats
it
is
a
matter
of
importance
that
clear
concepts
should
be
formed
regarding
at
least
the
familiar
things
of
life
the
list
of
clear
concepts
should
be
added
to
from
time
to
time
by
study
investigation
and
examination
the
dictionary
should
be
consulted
frequently
and
a
term
studied
until
one
has
a
clear
meaning
of
the
concept
the
term
seeks
to
express
a
good
encyclopedia
not
necessarily
an
expensive
one
in
these
days
of
cheap
editions
will
also
prove
very
useful
in
this
respect
as
halleck
says
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
most
of
our
concepts
are
subject
to
change
during
our
entire
life
that
at
first
they
are
made
only
in
a
tentative
way
that
experience
may
show
us
at
any
time
that
they
have
been
erroneously
formed
that
we
have
abstracted
too
little
or
too
much
made
the
class
too
wide
or
too
narrow
or
that
here
a
quality
must
be
added
or
there
one
taken
away
it
is
a
good
practice
to
make
a
memorandum
of
anything
of
which
you
may
hear
but
of
which
you
know
nothing
and
then
later
to
make
a
brief
but
thorough
investigation
of
that
thing
by
means
of
the
dictionary
and
encyclopedia
and
of
whatever
good
works
may
be
obtained
on
the
subject
not
leaving
it
until
you
feel
that
you
have
obtained
at
least
a
of
what
the
thing
really
a
half
hour
each
evening
devoted
to
exercise
of
this
kind
will
result
in
a
wonderful
increase
of
general
information
we
have
heard
of
a
man
who
made
a
practice
of
reading
a
short
article
in
the
encyclopedia
every
evening
giving
preference
to
subjects
generally
classed
as
familiar
in
a
year
he
made
a
noticeable
advance
in
general
knowledge
as
well
as
habits
of
thought
in
five
years
he
was
looked
upon
by
his
associates
as
a
man
of
a
remarkably
large
field
of
general
information
and
of
more
than
ordinary
intelligence
which
verdict
was
a
just
one
as
a
rule
we
waste
far
more
time
on
worthless
fiction
than
we
are
willing
to
devote
to
a
little
of
this
kind
we
shrink
at
the
idea
of
a
general
course
of
instructive
reading
little
realizing
that
we
can
take
our
study
in
small
installments
and
at
a
very
little
cost
in
time
or
labor
our
concepts
form
the
material
which
our
intellect
uses
in
its
reasoning
processes
no
matter
how
good
a
reasoner
one
may
be
unless
he
has
a
good
supply
of
general
information
about
the
things
of
which
he
is
reasoning
he
will
not
make
much
real
headway
we
must
begin
at
the
bottom
and
build
a
firm
foundation
upon
which
the
intellectual
structure
may
be
erected
this
foundation

composed

xxiii
judgments
we
have
seen
the
several
steps
of
the
mental
process
whereby
simple
sensations
are
transformed
into
percepts
and
then
into
concepts
or
general
ideas
the
formation
of
the
concept
is
considered
as
the
first
great
step
in
thinking
the
second
great
step
in
thinking
is
that
of
the
formation
of
the
judgment
the
definition
of
judgment
as
the
term
is
used
in
logic
is
the
comparing
together
in
the
mind
of
two
ideas
of
things
and
determining
whether
they
agree
or
disagree
with
each
other
or
that
one
of
them
does
or
does
not
belong
to
the
other
judgment
is
therefore
affirmative
or
negative
as
is
white
or
white
men
are
not
europeans
what
in
logic
is
called
a
proposition
is
the
expression
in
words
of
a
logical
judgment
hyslop
defined
the
term
proposition
as
follows
any
affirmation
or
denial
of
an
agreement
between
two
conceptions
for
instance
we
compare
the
concepts
sparrow
and
bird
and
find
that
there
is
an
agreement
and
that
the
former
belongs
to
the
latter
this
mental
process
is
a
we
then
announce
the
judgment
in
the
the
sparrow
is
a
bird
in
the
same
way
we
compare
the
concepts
bat
and
bird
find
that
there
is
a
disagreement
and
form
the
judgment
that
neither
belongs
to
the
other
which
we
express
in
the
proposition
the
bat
is
not
a
bird
or
we
may
form
the
judgment
that
sweetness
is
a
quality
of
sugar
which
we
express
in
the
proposition
sugar
is
sweet
likewise
we
may
form
the
judgment
which
results
in
the
proposition
vinegar
is
not
sweet
while
the
process
of
judgment
is
generally
considered
as
constituting
the
second
great
step
of
thinking
coming
after
the
formation
of
the
concept
and
consisting
of
the
comparing
of
concepts
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
act
of
judging
is
far
more
elementary
than
this
for
it
is
found
still
farther
back
in
the
history
of
thought
processes
by
that
peculiar
law
of
paradox
which
we
find
everywhere
operative
in
mind
processes
the
same
process
of
forming
judgments
which
is
used
in
comparing
concepts
also
has
been
used
in
forming
the
same
concepts
in
the
stage
of
comparison
in
fact
the
result
of
all
comparison
high
or
low
must
be
halleck
says
judgment
is
necessary
in
forming
concepts
when
we
decide
that
a
quality
is
or
is
not
common
to
a
class
we
are
really
judging
this
is
another
evidence
of
the
complexity
and
unified
action
of
the
mind
brooks
says
the
power
of
judgment
is
of
great
value
in
its
products
it
is
involved
in
or
accompanies
every
act
of
the
intellect
and
thus
lies
at
the
foundation
of
all
intellectual
activity
it
operates
directly
in
every
act
of
the
understanding
and
even
aids
the
other
faculties
of
the
mind
in
completing
their
activities
and
products
strictly
speaking
every
intelligent
act
of
the
mind
is
accompanied
with
a
judgment
to
know
is
to
discriminate
and
therefore
to
judge
every
sensation
or
cognition
involves
a
knowledge
and
so
a
judgment
that
it
exists
the
mind
can
not
think
at
all
without
judging
to
think
is
to
judge
even
in
forming
the
notions
which
judgment
compares
the
mind
judges
every
notion
or
concept
implies
a
previous
act
of
judgment
to
form
it
in
forming
a
concept
we
compare
the
common
attributes
before
we
unite
them
and
comparison
is
judgment
it
is
thus
true
that
concept
is
a
contracted
judgment
every
judgment
an
expanded
concept
it
is
needless
to
say
that
as
judgments
lie
at
the
base
of
our
thinking
and
also
appear
in
every
part
of
its
higher
structure
the
importance
of
correct
judgment
in
thought
can
not
be
overestimated
but
it
is
often
very
difficult
to
form
correct
judgment
even
regarding
the
most
familiar
things
around
us
halleck
says
in
actual
life
things
present
themselves
to
us
with
their
qualities
disguised
or
obscured
by
other
conflicting
qualities
men
had
for
ages
seen
burning
substances
and
had
formed
a
concept
of
them
a
certain
hard
black
stony
substance
had
often
been
noticed
and
a
concept
had
been
formed
of
it
this
concept
was
imperfect
but
it
is
very
seldom
that
we
meet
with
perfect
concepts
in
actual
life
so
it
happened
that
for
ages
the
concept
of
burning
substance
was
never
linked
by
judgment
to
the
concept
of
stone
coal
the
combustible
quality
in
the
coal
was
overshadowed
by
its
stony
attributes
course
stone
will
not
burn
people
said
one
can
not
tell
how
long
the
development
of
mankind
was
retarded
for
that
very
reason
england
would
not
be
manufacturing
products
for
the
rest
of
the
world
had
not
some
one
judged
coal
to
be
a
combustible
substance
judgment
is
ever
silently
working
and
comparing
things
that
to
past
ages
seemed
dissimilar
and
it
is
constantly
abstracting
and
leaving
out
of
the
field
of
view
those
qualities
which
have
simply
served
to
obscure
the
point
at
issue
gordy
says
the
credulity
of
children
is
proverbial
but
if
we
get
our
facts
at
first
hand
if
we
study
living
learning
playing
child
we
shall
see
that
he
is
quite
as
remarkable
for
incredulity
as
for
credulity
the
explanation
is
simple
tends
to
believe
the
first
suggestion
that
comes
into
his
mind
no
matter
from
what
and
since
his
belief
is
not
the
result
of
any
rational
process
he
can
not
be
made
to
disbelieve
it
in
any
rational
way
hence
it
is
that
he
is
very
credulous
about
any
matter
about
which
he
has
no
ideas
but
let
the
idea
once
get
possession
of
his
mind
and
he
is
quite
as
remarkable
for
incredulity
as
before
for
credulity
if
we
study
the
larger
child
the
man
with
a
child
mind
an
uneducated
man
we
shall
have
the
same
truth
forced
upon
us
if
the
beliefs
of
men
were
due
to
processes
of
reasoning
where
they
have
not
reasoned
they
would
not
believe
but
do
we
find
it
so
is
it
not
true
that
the
men
who
have
the
most
positive
opinions
on
the
largest
variety
of
subjects
so
far
as
they
have
ever
heard
of
them
are
precisely
those
who
have
the
least
right
to
them
socrates
we
remember
was
counted
the
wisest
man
in
athens
because
he
alone
resisted
his
natural
tendency
to
believe
in
the
absence
of
evidence
he
alone
would
not
delude
himself
with
the
conceit
of
knowledge
without
the
reality
and
it
would
scarcely
be
too
much
to
say
that
the
intellectual
strength
of
men
is
in
direct
proportion
to
the
number
of
things
they
are
absolutely
certain
of
i
do
not
of
course
mean
to
intimate
that
we
should
have
no
opinions
about
matters
that
we
have
not
personally
investigated
we
take
and
ought
to
take
the
opinion
of
some
men
about
law
and
others
about
medicine
and
others
about
particular
sciences
and
so
on
but
we
should
clearly
realize
the
difference
between
holding
an
opinion
on
trust
and
holding
it
as
the
result
of
our
own
investigations
brooks
says
it
should
be
one
of
the
leading
objects
of
the
culture
of
young
people
to
lead
them
to
acquire
the
habit
of
forming
judgments
they
should
not
only
be
led
to
see
things
but
to
have
opinions
about
things
they
should
be
trained
to
see
things
in
their
relations
and
to
put
these
relations
into
definite
propositions
their
ideas
of
objects
should
be
worked
up
into
thoughts
concerning
the
objects
those
methods
of
teaching
are
best
which
tend
to
excite
a
thoughtful
habit
of
mind
that
notices
the
similitudes
and
diversities
of
objects
and
endeavors
to
read
the
thoughts
which
they
embody
and
of
which
they
are
the
symbols
the
study
of
logic
geometry
and
the
natural
sciences
is
recommended
for
exercise
of
the
faculty
of
judgment
and
the
development
thereof
the
study
and
practice
of
even
the
lower
branches
of
mathematics
are
also
helpful
in
this
direction
the
game
of
checkers
or
chess
is
recommended
by
many
authorities
some
have
advocated
the
practice
of
solving
enigmas
problems
rebuses
as
giving
exercise
to
this
faculty
of
the
mind
the
cultivation
of
the
why
attitude
of
mind
and
the
answering
of
one
own
mental
questions
is
also
helpful
if
not
carried
to
excess
doubting
thomas
is
not
always
a
term
of
reproach
in

many
warm
admirers
chapter
xxiv
primary
laws
of
thought
in
connection
with
this
subject
we
herewith
call
the
attention
of
the
student
to
the
primary
laws
of
thought
which
have
been
recognized
as
valid
from
the
time
of
the
ancient
greek
logicians
these
laws
are
and
are
uncontradictable
they
are
axiomatic
jevons
says
of
them
students
are
seldom
able
to
see
at
first
their
full
meaning
and
importance
all
arguments
may
be
explained
when
these
laws
are
granted
and
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
whole
of
logic
will
be
plain
to
those
who
will
constantly
use
these
laws
as
their
key
here
are
the
three
primary
laws
of
thought
i
of
whatever
is
ii
of
nothing
can
both
be
and
not
be
iii
of
excluded
everything
must
either
be
or
not
be
there
is
no
middle
course
i
the
first
of
these
laws
called
law
of
informs
us
that
a
thing
is
always
itself
no
matter
under
what
guise
or
form
it
is
perceived
or
may
present
itself
an
animal
is
always
a
bird
if
it
possesses
the
general
characteristics
of
a
bird
no
matter
whether
it
exhibits
the
minor
characteristics
of
an
eagle
a
wren
a
stork
or
a
humming
bird
in
the
same
way
a
whale
is
a
mammal
because
it
possesses
the
general
characteristics
of
a
mammal
notwithstanding
that
it
swims
in
the
water
like
a
fish
also
sweetness
is
always
sweetness
whether
manifested
in
sugar
honey
flowers
or
products
of
coal
tar
if
a
thing
that
thing
then
it
and
it
can
not
be
logically
claimed
that
it
ii
the
second
of
these
laws
called
law
of
informs
us
that
the
same
quality
or
class
can
not
be
both
affirmed
and
denied
of
a
thing
at
the
same
time
and
place
a
sparrow
can
not
be
said
to
be
both
bird
and
not
bird
at
the
same
time
neither
can
sugar
be
said
to
be
sweet
and
not
sweet
at
the
same
time
a
piece
of
iron
may
be
hot
at
one
end
and
not
hot
at
another
but
it
can
not
be
both
hot
and
not
hot
at
the
same
place
at
the
same
time
iii
the
third
of
these
laws
called
law
of
excluded
informs
us
that
a
given
quality
or
class
be
affirmed
or
denied
to
at
any
given
time
and
place
everything
either
must
be
of
a
certain
class
or
not
must
possess
a
certain
quality
or
not
at
a
given
time
or
place
there
is
no
other
alternative
or
middle
course
it
is
axiomatic
that
any
statement
either
be
or
not
be
true
of
a
certain
other
thing
at
any
certain
time
and
place
there
is
no
escape
from
this
anything
must
be
black
or
not
black
a
bird
or
not
a
bird
alive
or
not
alive
at
any
certain
time
or
place
there
is
nothing
else
that
it
can
be
it
can
not
both
be
and
not
be
at
the
same
time
and
place
as
we
have
seen
therefore
it
must
either
be
or
not
be
that
which
is
asserted
of
it
the
judgment
must
decide
which
alternative
but
it
has
only
two
possible
choices
but
the
student
must
not
confuse
opposite
qualities
or
things
with
a
thing
may
be
black
or
not
black
but
it
need
not
be
white
to
be
not
black
for
blue
is
likewise
not
black
just
as
it
is
not
white
the
neglect
of
this
fact
frequently
causes
error
we
must
always
affirm
either
the
existence
or
of
a
quality
in
a
thing
but
this
is
far
different
from
affirming
or
denying
the
existence
of
the
opposite
quality
thus
a
thing
may
be
not
hard
and
yet
it
does
not
follow
that
it
is
soft
it
may
be
hard
nor
soft
fallacious
application
there
exists
what
are
known
as
fallacies
of
application
of
these
primary
laws
a
fallacy
is
an
unsound
argument
or
conclusion
for
instance
because
a
particular
man
is
found
to
be
a
liar
it
is
fallacious
to
assume
that
men
are
liars
for
lying
is
a
particular
quality
of
the
individual
man
and
not
a
general
quality
of
the
family
of
men
in
the
same
way
because
a
stork
has
long
legs
and
a
long
bill
it
does
not
follow
that
all
birds
must
have
these
characteristics
simply
because
the
stork
is
a
bird
is
fallacious
to
extend
an
individual
quality
to
a
but
it
is
sound
judgment
to
assume
that
a
class
quality
must
be
possessed
by
all
individuals
in
that
class
it
is
a
far
different
proposition
which
asserts
that
birds
are
black
from
that
which
asserts
that
birds
are
black
the
same
rule
of
course
is
true
regarding
negative
propositions
another
fallacy
is
that
which
assumes
that
because
the
affirmative
or
negative
proposition
has
not
been
or
can
not
be
proved
it
follows
that
the
opposite
proposition
must
be
true
the
true
judgment
is
simply
not
proven
another
fallacious
judgment
is
that
which
is
based
on
attributing
absolute
quality
to
that
which
is
but
relative
or
comparative
for
instance
the
terms
hot
and
cold
are
relative
and
comparative
and
simply
denote
one
relative
opinion
regarding
a
fixed
and
certain
degree
of
temperature
the
thing
is
the
degree
of
temperature
say
degrees
fahrenheit
of
this
we
may
logically
claim
that
it
or
true
at
a
certain
time
or
place
it
either
degrees
fahrenheit
or
it
but
to
one
man
this
may
seem
and
to
another
both
are
right
in
their
judgments
so
far
as
their
own
relative
feelings
are
concerned
but
neither
can
claim
absolutely
that
it
is
or
therefore
it
is
a
fallacy
to
ascribe
absolute
quality
to
a
relative
one
the
comes
under
the
law
of
excluded
middle
but
a
personal
opinion
is
not
an
absolute
fact
there
are
other
fallacies
which
will
be
considered
in
other
chapters
of
this
book
under
their
appropriate
heading

reasoning
reasoning
the
third
great
step
in
thinking
may
be
said
to
consist
of
ascertaining
new
truths
from
old
ones
new
judgments
from
old
ones
unknown
facts
from
known
ones
in
short
of
proceeding
logically
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
using
the
known
as
the
foundation
for
the
unknown
which
is
sought
to
be
known
gordy
gives
us
the
following
excellent
definition
of
the
term
reasoning
is
the
act
of
going
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
through
other
beliefs
of
basing
judgment
upon
judgments
reaching
beliefs
through
beliefs
reasoning
then
is
seen
to
be
a
process
of
building
a
structure
of
judgments
one
resting
upon
the
other
the
topmost
point
being
the
final
judgment
but
the
whole
constituting
an
edifice
of
judgment
this
may
be
seen
more
clearly
when
the
various
forms
of
reasoning
are
considered
immediate
reasoning
the
simplest
form
of
reasoning
is
that
known
as
immediate
reasoning
by
which
is
meant
reasoning
by
directly
comparing
two
judgments
without
the
intervention
of
the
third
judgment
which
is
found
in
the
more
formal
classes
of
reasoning
this
form
of
reasoning
depends
largely
upon
the
application
of
the
three
primary
laws
of
thought
to
which
we
have
referred
in
a
previous
chapter
it
will
be
seen
that
a
thing
is
always
itself
then
all
that
is
included
in
it
must
partake
of
its
nature
thus
the
bird
family
has
certain
class
characteristics
therefore
by
immediate
reasoning
we
know
that
member
of
that
family
must
possess
those
class
characteristics
whatever
particular
characteristics
it
may
have
in
addition
and
we
likewise
know
that
we
can
not
attribute
the
characteristics
as
a
matter
of
course
to
the
other
members
of
the
class
thus
though
all
sparrows
are
birds
it
is
not
true
that
all
birds
are
sparrows
all
biscuits
are
bread
but
all
bread
is
not
biscuit
in
the
same
way
we
know
that
a
thing
can
not
be
bird
and
mammal
at
the
same
time
for
the
mammals
form
a
family
and
likewise
we
know
that
everything
be
either
bird
or
not
bird
but
that
being
not
bird
does
not
mean
being
a
mammal
for
there
are
many
other
things
than
mammals
in
this
form
of
reasoning
distinction
is
always
made
between
the
or
general
class
which
is
expressed
by
the
word
and
the
or
individual
which
is
expressed
by
the
word
some
many
persons
fail
to
note
this
difference
in
their
reasoning
and
fallaciously
reason
for
instance
that
because
swans
are
white
swans
must
be
so
which
is
a
far
different
thing
from
reasoning
that
if
is
so
and
so
then
must
be
so
and
so
those
who
are
interested
in
this
subject
are
referred
to
some
elementary
on
logic
as
the
detailed
consideration
is
too
technical
for
consideration
here
reasoning
by
analogy
reasoning
by
analogy
is
an
elementary
form
of
reasoning
and
is
the
particular
kind
of
reasoning
employed
by
the
majority
of
persons
in
ordinary
thought
it
is
based
upon
the
unconscious
recognition
by
the
human
mind
of
the
principle
which
is
expressed
by
jevons
as
two
or
more
things
resemble
each
other
in
many
points
they
will
probably
resemble
each
other
in
more
the
same
authority
says
reasoning
by
analogy
differs
only
in
degree
from
that
kind
of
reasoning
called
when
resemble
each
other
in
a
we
argue
about
them
by
generalization
when
a
resemble
each
other
in
it
is
a
case
of
analogy
while
this
form
of
reason
is
frequently
employed
with
more
or
less
satisfactory
results
it
is
always
open
to
a
large
percentage
of
error
thus
persons
have
been
poisoned
by
toadstools
by
reason
of
false
analogous
reasoning
that
because
mushrooms
are
edible
then
toadstools
which
resemble
them
must
also
be
fit
for
food
or
in
the
same
way
because
certain
berries
resemble
other
edible
berries
they
must
likewise
be
good
food
as
brooks
says
to
infer
that
because
john
smith
has
a
red
nose
and
is
also
a
drunkard
then
henry
jones
who
also
has
a
red
nose
is
also
a
drunkard
would
be
dangerous
inference
conclusions
of
this
kind
drawn
from
analogy
are
frequently
dangerous
halleck
says
many
false
analogies
are
manufactured
and
it
is
excellent
thought
training
to
expose
them
the
majority
of
people
think
so
little
that
they
swallow
these
false
analogies
just
as
robins
swallow
small
stones
dropped
into
their
mouths
jevons
one
of
the
best
authorities
on
the
subject
says
there
is
no
way
in
which
we
can
really
assure
ourselves
that
we
are
arguing
safely
by
analogy
the
only
rule
that
can
be
given
is
this
that
the
more
closely
two
things
resemble
each
other
the
more
likely
it
is
that
they
are
the
same
in
other
respects
especially
in
points
closely
connected
with
those
observed
in
order
to
be
clear
about
our
conclusions
we
ought
in
fact
never
to
rest
satisfied
with
mere
analogy
but
ought
to
try
to
discover
the
general
laws
governing
the
case
we
find
that
reasoning
by
analogy
is
not
to
be
depended
upon
unless
we
make
such
an
inquiry
into
the
causes
and
laws
of
the
things
in
question
that
we
really
employ
inductive
and
deductive
reasoning
higher
forms
of
reasoning
the
two
higher
forms
of
reasoning
are
known
respectively
as
inductive
reasoning
or
inference
from
particular
facts
to
general
laws
and
deductive
reasoning
or
inference
from
general
truths
to
particular
truths
while
the
class
distinction
is
made
for
the
purpose
of
clear
consideration
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
two
forms
of
reasoning
are
generally
found
in
combination
thus
in
inductive
reasoning
many
steps
are
taken
by
the
aid
of
deductive
reasoning
and
likewise
before
we
can
reason
deductively
from
general
truths
to
particular
ones
we
must
have
discovered
the
general
truths
by
inductive
reasoning
from
particular
facts
thus
there
is
a
unity
in
all
reasoning
processes
as
there
is
in
all
mental
operations
inductive
reasoning
is
a
process
deductive
reasoning
an
one
in
the
first
we
combine
and
build
up
in
the
latter
we
dissect
and
separate
chapter
xxvi
inductive
reasoning
inductive
reasoning
is
based
upon
the
axiom
is
true
of
the
many
is
true
of
the
this
axiom
is
based
upon
man
belief
in
the
uniformity
of
nature
inductive
reasoning
is
a
mental
ladder
by
which
we
climb
from
particular
facts
to
general
laws
but
the
ladder
rests
upon
the
belief
that
the
universe
is
governed
by
law
the
steps
in
inductive
reasoning
are
as
follows
i
observation
investigation
and
examination
of
particular
facts
or
things
if
we
wish
to
know
the
general
characteristics
of
the
bird
family
we
must
first
examine
a
sufficient
number
of
birds
of
many
kinds
so
as
to
discover
the
comparatively
few
general
characteristics
possessed
by
of
the
bird
family
as
distinct
from
the
particular
characteristics
possessed
by
only
of
that
family
the
greater
the
number
of
individuals
examined
the
narrower
becomes
our
list
of
the
general
qualities
common
to
in
the
same
way
we
must
examine
many
kinds
of
flowers
before
we
come
to
the
few
general
qualities
common
to
all
flowers
which
we
combine
in
the
general
concept
of
flower
the
same
of
course
is
true
regarding
the
discovery
of
general
laws
from
particular
facts
we
examine
the
facts
and
then
work
toward
a
general
law
which
will
explain
them
for
instance
the
law
of
gravitation
was
discovered
by
the
observation
and
investigation
of
the
fact
that
all
objects
are
attracted
to
the
earth
further
investigation
revealed
the
fact
that
all
material
objects
are
attracted
to
each
other
then
the
general
law
was
discovered
or
rather
the
hypothesis
was
advanced
was
found
to
explain
the
facts
and
was
verified
by
further
experiments
and
observation
ii
the
second
step
in
inductive
reasoning
is
the
making
of
an
hypothesis
an
hypothesis
is
a
proposition
or
principle
assumed
as
a
explanation
for
a
set
or
class
of
facts
it
is
regarded
as
a
working
theory
which
must
be
examined
and
tested
in
connection
with
the
facts
before
it
is
finally
accepted
for
instance
after
the
observation
that
a
number
of
magnets
attracted
steel
it
was
found
reasonable
to
advance
the
hypothesis
that
all
magnets
attract
steel
in
the
same
way
was
advanced
the
hypothesis
that
all
birds
are
winged
feathered
oviparous
vertebrates
subsequent
observation
and
experiment
established
the
hypothesis
regarding
the
magnet
and
regarding
the
general
qualities
of
the
bird
family
if
a
single
magnet
had
been
found
which
did
not
attract
steel
then
the
hypothesis
would
have
fallen
if
a
single
bird
had
been
discovered
which
was
not
then
that
quality
would
have
been
stricken
from
the
list
of
the
necessary
characteristics
of
all
birds
a
theory
is
merely
an
hypothesis
which
has
been
verified
or
established
by
continued
and
repeated
observation
investigation
and
experiment
hypotheses
and
theories
arise
very
frequently
from
the
subconscious
assimilation
of
a
number
of
particular
facts
and
the
consequent
flashing
of
a
great
guess
or
sacred
suspicion
of
the
truth
into
the
conscious
field
of
attention
the
scientific
imagination
plays
an
important
part
in
this
process
there
is
of
course
a
world
of
difference
between
a
blind
guess
based
upon
insufficient
data
and
a
scientific
guess
resulting
from
the
accumulation
of
a
vast
store
of
careful
and
accurate
information
as
brooks
says
the
forming
of
an
hypothesis
requires
a
suggestive
mind
a
lively
fancy
a
philosophic
imagination
that
catches
a
glimpse
of
the
idea
through
the
form
or
sees
the
law
standing
behind
the
fact
but
accepted
theories
in
the
majority
of
cases
arise
only
by
testing
out
and
rejecting
many
promising
hypotheses
and
finally
settling
upon
the
one
which
best
answers
all
the
requirements
and
best
explains
the
facts
as
an
authority
says
to
try
wrong
guesses
is
with
most
persons
the
only
way
to
hit
upon
right
ones
iii
testing
the
hypothesis
by
deductive
reasoning
is
the
third
step
in
inductive
reasoning
this
test
is
made
by
applying
the
hypothetical
principle
to
particular
facts
or
things
that
is
to
follow
out
mentally
the
hypothetical
principle
to
its
logical
conclusion
this
may
be
done
in
this
way
if
and
is
correct
then
it
follows
that
and
is
true
etc
if
the
conclusion
agrees
with
reason
then
the
test
is
deemed
satisfactory
so
far
as
it
has
gone
but
if
the
result
proves
to
be
a
logical
absurdity
or
inconsistent
with
natural
facts
then
the
hypothesis
is
discredited
iv
practical
verification
of
the
hypothesis
is
the
fourth
step
in
inductive
reasoning
this
step
consists
of
the
actual
comparison
of
observed
facts
with
the
logical
conclusions
arising
from
applying
deductive
reasoning
to
the
general
principle
assumed
as
a
premise
the
greater
number
of
facts
agreeing
with
the
conclusions
arising
from
the
premise
of
the
hypothesis
the
greater
is
deemed
the
probability
of
the
latter
the
authorities
generally
assume
an
hypothesis
to
be
when
it
accounts
for
the
facts
which
properly
are
related
to
it
some
extremists
contend
however
that
before
an
hypothesis
may
be
considered
as
absolutely
verified
it
must
not
only
account
for
all
the
associated
facts
but
that
also
there
must
be
no
other
possible
hypothesis
to
account
for
the
same
facts
the
facts
referred
to
in
this
connection
may
be
either
observed
phenomena
or
the
conclusions
of
deductive
reasoning
arising
from
the
assumption
of
the
hypothesis
or
the
agreement
between
the
observed
facts
and
the
logical
conclusions
the
last
combination
is
generally
regarded
as
the
most
logical
the
verification
of
an
hypothesis
must
be
an
one
and
there
must
be
an
agreement
between
the
observed
facts
and
the
logical
conclusions
in
the
case
the
hypothesis
must
fit
the
facts
and
the
facts
must
fit
the
hypothesis
the
facts
are
the
glass
slipper
of
the
cinderella
legend
the
several
sisters
of
cinderella
were
discarded
hypotheses
the
slipper
and
the
sisters
not
fitting
when
cinderella
foot
was
found
to
be
the
one
foot
upon
which
the
glass
slipper
fitted
then
the
cinderella
hypothesis
was
considered
to
have
been
proved
the
glass
slipper
was
hers
and
the
prince
claimed
his
bride
chapter
xxvii
deductive
reasoning
we
have
seen
in
the
preceding
chapter
that
from
particular
facts
we
reason
inductively
to
general
principles
or
truths
we
have
also
seen
that
one
of
the
steps
of
inductive
reasoning
is
the
testing
of
the
hypothesis
by
deductive
reasoning
we
shall
now
also
see
that
the
results
of
inductive
reasoning
are
used
as
premises
or
bases
for
deductive
reasoning
these
two
forms
of
reasoning
are
opposites
and
yet
complementary
to
each
other
they
are
in
a
sense
independent
and
yet
are
interdependent
brooks
says
the
two
methods
of
reasoning
are
the
reverse
of
each
other
one
goes
from
particulars
to
generals
the
other
from
generals
to
particulars
one
is
a
process
of
analysis
the
other
is
a
process
of
synthesis
one
rises
from
facts
to
laws
the
other
descends
from
laws
to
facts
each
is
independent
of
the
other
and
each
is
a
valid
and
essential
method
of
inference
halleck
well
expresses
the
spirit
of
deductive
reasoning
as
follows
after
induction
has
classified
certain
phenomena
and
thus
given
us
a
major
premise
we
may
proceed
deductively
to
apply
the
inference
to
any
new
specimen
that
can
be
shown
to
belong
to
that
class
induction
hands
over
to
deduction
a
premise
deduction
takes
that
as
a
fact
making
no
inquiry
regarding
its
truth
only
after
general
laws
have
been
laid
down
after
objects
have
been
classified
after
major
premises
have
been
formed
can
deduction
be
employed
deductive
reasoning
proceeds
from
general
principles
to
particular
facts
it
is
a
descending
process
analytical
in
its
nature
it
rests
upon
the
fundamental
axiomatic
basis
that
is
true
of
the
whole
is
true
of
its
or
is
true
of
the
universal
is
true
of
the
the
process
of
deductive
reasoning
may
be
stated
briefly
as
follows
a
general
principle
of
a
class
is
stated
as
a
a
particular
thing
is
stated
as
belonging
to
that
general
class
this
statement
being
the
therefore
the
general
class
principle
is
held
to
apply
to
the
particular
thing
this
last
statement
being
the
premise
is
a
proposition
assumed
to
be
true
the
following
gives
us
an
illustration
of
the
above
process
i
a
bird
is
a
feathered
winged
oviparous
vertebrate
ii
the
sparrow
is
a
bird
therefore
iii
the
sparrow
is
a
feathered
winged
oviparous
vertebrate
or
again
i
rattlesnakes
frequently
bite
when
enraged
and
their
bite
is
poisonous
ii
this
snake
before
me
is
a
rattlesnake
therefore
iii
this
snake
before
me
may
bite
when
enraged
and
its
bite
will
be
poisonous
the
average
person
may
be
inclined
to
object
that
he
is
not
conscious
of
going
through
this
complicated
process
when
he
reasons
about
sparrows
or
rattlesnakes
but
he
nevertheless
he
is
not
conscious
of
the
steps
because
mental
habit
has
accustomed
him
to
the
process
and
it
is
performed
more
or
less
automatically
but
these
three
steps
manifest
in
all
processes
of
deductive
reasoning
even
the
simplest
the
average
person
is
like
the
character
in
the
french
play
who
was
surprised
to
learn
that
he
had
been
talking
prose
for
forty
years
without
knowing
it
jevons
says
that
the
majority
of
persons
are
equally
surprised
when
they
find
out
that
they
have
been
using
logical
forms
more
or
less
correctly
without
having
realized
it
he
says
a
large
number
even
of
educated
persons
have
no
clear
idea
of
what
logic
is
yet
in
a
certain
way
every
one
must
have
been
a
logician
since
he
began
to
speak
there
are
many
technical
rules
and
principles
of
logic
which
we
can
not
attempt
to
consider
here
there
are
however
a
few
elementary
principles
of
correct
reasoning
which
should
have
a
place
here
what
is
known
as
a
syllogism
is
the
expression
in
words
of
the
various
parts
of
the
complete
process
of
reasoning
or
argument
whately
defines
it
as
follows
a
syllogism
is
an
argument
expressed
in
strict
logical
form
so
that
its
conclusiveness
is
manifest
from
the
structure
of
the
expression
alone
without
any
regard
to
the
meaning
of
the
term
in
short
the
two
premises
are
accepted
as
correct
it
follows
that
there
can
be
only
one
true
logical
conclusion
resulting
therefrom
in
abstract
or
theoretical
reasoning
the
word
is
assumed
to
precede
each
of
the
two
premises
the
therefore
before
the
conclusion
resulting
from
the
if
of
course
the
following
are
the
general
rules
governing
the
syllogism
i
every
syllogism
must
consist
of
three
and
no
more
than
three
propositions
namely
the
major
premise
the
minor
premise
and
the
conclusion
ii
the
conclusion
must
naturally
follow
from
the
premises
otherwise
the
syllogism
is
invalid
and
constitutes
a
fallacy
or
sophism
iii
one
premise
at
least
must
be
affirmative
iv
if
one
premise
is
negative
the
conclusion
must
be
negative
one
premise
at
least
must
be
universal
or
general
vi
if
one
premise
is
particular
the
conclusion
also
must
be
particular
the
last
two
rules
and
vi
contain
the
essential
principles
of
all
the
rules
regarding
syllogisms
and
any
syllogism
which
breaks
them
will
be
found
also
to
break
other
rules
some
of
which
are
not
stated
here
for
the
reason
that
they
are
too
technical
these
two
rules
may
be
tested
by
constructing
syllogisms
in
violation
of
their
principles
the
reason
for
them
is
as
follows
rule
because
from
two
particular
premises
no
conclusion
can
be
drawn
as
for
instance
some
men
are
mortal
john
is
a
man
we
can
not
reason
from
this
either
that
john
or
mortal
the
major
premise

because
a
universal
conclusion
can
be
drawn
only
from
two
universal
premises
an
example
being
needless
here
as
the
conclusion
is
so
obvious
cultivation
of
reasoning
faculties
there
is
no
royal
road
to
the
cultivation
of
the
reasoning
faculties
there
is
but
the
old
familiar
rule
practice
exercise
use
nevertheless
there
are
certain
studies
which
tend
to
develop
the
faculties
in
question
the
study
of
arithmetic
especially
mental
arithmetic
tends
to
develop
correct
habits
of
reasoning
from
one
truth
to
another
from
cause
to
effect
better
still
is
the
study
of
geometry
and
best
of
all
of
course
is
the
study
of
logic
and
the
practice
of
working
out
its
problems
and
examples
the
study
of
philosophy
and
psychology
also
is
useful
in
this
way
many
lawyers
and
teachers
have
drilled
themselves
in
geometry
solely
for
the
purpose
of
developing
their
logical
reasoning
powers
brooks
says
so
valuable
is
geometry
as
a
discipline
that
many
lawyers
and
others
review
their
geometry
every
year
in
order
to
keep
the
mind
drilled
to
logical
habits
of
thinking
the
study
of
logic
will
aid
in
the
development
of
the
power
of
deductive
reasoning
it
does
this
first
by
showing
the
method
by
which
we
reason
to
know
how
we
reason
to
see
the
laws
which
govern
the
reasoning
process
to
analyze
the
syllogism
and
see
its
conformity
to
the
laws
of
thought
is
not
only
an
exercise
of
reasoning
but
gives
that
knowledge
of
the
process
that
will
be
both
a
stimulus
and
a
guide
to
thought
no
one
can
trace
the
principles
and
processes
of
thought
without
receiving
thereby
an
impetus
to
thought
in
the
second
place
the
study
of
logic
is
probably
even
more
valuable
because
it
gives
practice
in
deductive
thinking
this
perhaps
is
its
principal
value
since
the
mind
reasons
instinctively
without
knowing
how
it
reasons
one
can
think
without
the
knowledge
of
the
science
of
thinking
just
as
one
can
use
language
correctly
without
a
knowledge
of
grammar
yet
as
the
study
of
grammar
improves
one
speech
so
the
study
of
logic
can
but
improve
one
thought
in
the
opinion
of
the
writer
hereof
one
of
the
best
though
simple
methods
of
cultivating
the
faculties
of
reasoning
is
to
acquaint
self
thoroughly
with
the
more
common
or
forms
of
false
reasoning
so
thoroughly
that
not
only
is
the
false
reasoning
detected
at
once
but
also
the
of
its
falsity
is
readily
understood
to
understand
the
wrong
ways
of
reasoning
is
to
be
on
guard
against
them
by
guarding
against
them
we
tend
to
eliminate
them
from
our
thought
processes
if
we
eliminate
the
false
we
have
the
true
left
in
its
place
therefore
we
recommend
the
weeding
of
the
logical
garden
of
the
common
fallacies
to
the
end
that
the
flowers
of
pure
reason
may
flourish
in
their
stead
accordingly
we
think
it
well
to
call
your
attention
in
the
next
chapter
to
the
more
common
fallacies
and
the
reason
of
their
falsity
chapter
xxviii
fallacious
reasoning
a
fallacy
is
defined
as
an
unsound
argument
or
mode
of
arguing
which
while
appearing
to
be
decisive
of
a
question
is
in
reality
not
so
or
a
fallacious
statement
or
proposition
in
which
the
error
is
not
readily
apparent
when
a
fallacy
is
used
to
deceive
others
it
is
called
it
is
important
that
the
student
should
understand
the
nature
of
the
fallacy
and
understand
its
most
common
forms
as
jevons
says
in
learning
how
to
do
right
it
is
always
desirable
to
be
informed
as
to
the
ways
in
which
we
are
likely
to
go
wrong
in
describing
to
a
man
the
road
which
he
should
follow
we
ought
to
tell
him
not
only
the
turnings
which
he
is
to
take
but
also
the
turnings
which
he
is
to
avoid
similarly
it
is
a
useful
part
of
logic
which
teaches
us
the
ways
and
turnings
by
which
people
most
commonly
go
astray
in
reasoning
in
presenting
the
following
brief
statement
regarding
the
more
common
forms
of
fallacy
we
omit
so
far
as
possible
the
technical
details
which
belong
to
on
logic
fallacies
i
collective
but
false
an
example
of
this
fallacy
is
found
in
the
argument
that
because
the
french
race
collectively
are
excitable
therefore
a
particular
frenchman
must
be
excitable
or
that
because
the
jewish
race
collectively
are
good
business
people
therefore
the
particular
jew
must
be
a
good
business
man
this
is
as
fallacious
as
arguing
that
because
a
man
may
drown
in
the
ocean
he
should
avoid
the
bath
basin
or
cup
of
water
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
the
whole
of
a
thing
and
its
separate
parts
nitric
acid
and
glycerin
separately
are
not
explosive
but
combined
they
form
a
most
dangerous
and
powerful
explosive
reversing
this
form
of
illustration
we
remind
you
of
the
old
saying
salt
is
a
good
thing
but
one
does
want
to
be
put
in
pickle
ii
this
fallacy
consists
in
introducing
in
the
conclusion
matter
not
contained
in
the
premises
or
in
the
confusing
of
the
issue
for
instance
all
men
are
sinful
john
smith
is
a
man
therefore
john
smith
is
a
horse
thief
this
may
sound
absurd
but
many
arguments
are
as
fallacious
as
this
and
for
the
same
reason
or
another
and
more
subtle
form
all
thieves
are
liars
john
smith
is
a
liar
therefore
john
smith
is
a
thief
the
first
example
arises
from
the
introduction
of
new
matter
and
the
last
from
the
confusion
of
the
issue
iii
this
fallacy
consists
in
attributing
cause
to
a
thing
which
is
merely
coincident
with
or
precedent
to
the
effect
for
instance
the
cock
crows
just
before
or
at
the
moment
of
sunrise
therefore
the
is
the
cause
of
the
sunrise
or
again
bad
crops
followed
the
election
of
a
whig
president
therefore
the
whig
party
is
the
cause
of
the
bad
crops
or
again
where
civilization
is
the
highest
there
we
find
the
greatest
number
of
high
hats
therefore
high
hats
are
the
cause
of
civilization
iv
in
this
form
of
fallacy
the
person
reasoning
or
arguing
endeavors
to
explain
or
prove
a
thing
by
itself
or
its
own
terms
for
instance
the
whig
party
is
honest
because
it
advocates
honest
principles
the
whig
principles
are
honest
because
they
are
advocated
by
an
honest
party
a
common
form
of
this
fallacy
in
its
phase
of
sophistry
is
the
use
of
synonyms
in
such
a
manner
that
they
seem
to
express
more
than
the
original
conception
whereas
they
are
really
but
other
terms
for
the
same
thing
an
historic
example
of
circular
reasoning
is
the
following
the
church
of
england
is
the
true
church
because
it
was
established
by
god
it
must
have
been
established
by
god
because
it
is
the
true
church
this
form
of
sophistry
is
most
effective
when
employed
in
long
arguments
in
which
it
is
difficult
to
detect
it
the
this
fallacy
arises
from
the
use
of
a
false
premise
or
at
least
of
a
premise
the
truth
of
which
is
not
admitted
by
the
opponent
it
may
be
stated
simply
as
unwarranted
assumption
of
a
premise
generally
the
major
many
persons
in
public
life
argue
in
this
way
they
boldly
assert
an
unwarranted
premise
and
then
proceed
to
argue
logically
from
it
the
result
is
confusing
to
the
average
person
for
the
steps
of
the
reasoning
being
logical
it
seems
as
if
the
argument
is
sound
the
fact
of
the
unwarranted
premise
being
overlooked
the
person
using
this
form
of
sophistry
proceeds
on
aaron
burr
theory
of
truth
being
that
which
is
boldly
asserted
and
plausibly
maintained
bulwer
makes
one
of
his
characters
mention
a
particularly
atrocious
form
of
this
fallacy
although
an
amusing
one
in
the
following
words
whenever
you
are
about
to
utter
something
astonishingly
false
always
begin
with
is
an
acknowledged
fact
etc
sir
robert
filmer
was
a
master
of
this
manner
of
writing
thus
with
what
a
solemn
face
that
great
man
attempted
to
cheat
he
would
say
is
a
truth
that
there
can
not
be
any
multitude
of
men
whatsoever
either
great
or
small
but
that
in
the
same
multitude
there
is
one
man
among
them
in
nature
hath
a
right
to
be
king
of
all
the
rest
as
being
the
next
heir
of
look
carefully
for
the
major
premise
of
propositions
advanced
in
argument
spoken
or
written
be
sure
that
the
person
making
the
proposition
is
not
begging
the
question
by
unwarranted
assumption
of
the
general
rule
of
inference
hyslop
says
concerning
valid
inferences
and
fallacious
ones
we
can
not
infer
we
please
from
any
premises
we
please
we
must
conform
to
certain
definite
rules
or
principles
any
violation
of
them
will
be
a
fallacy
there
are
two
simple
rules
which
should
not
be
violated
in
the
conclusion
should
be
of
the
same
general
kind
as
in
the
facts
constituting
the
premises
must
be
accepted
and
must
not
be
a
close
observance
of
these
rules
will
result
in
the
detection
and
avoidance
of
the
principal
forms
of
fallacious
reasoning
and
sophistry
sophistical
arguments
there
are
a
number
of
tricky
practices
resorted
to
by
persons
in
argument
that
are
fallacious
in
intent
and
result
which
we
do
not
consider
here
in
detail
as
they
scarcely
belong
to
the
particular
subject
of
this
book
a
brief
mention
however
may
be
permitted
in
the
interest
of
general
information
here
are
the
principal
ones
arguing
that
a
proposition
is
correct
because
the
opponent
can
not
prove
the
contrary
the
fallacy
is
seen
when
we
realize
that
the
statement
the
moon
is
made
of
green
cheese
is
not
proved
because
we
can
not
prove
the
contrary
no
amount
of
failure
to
a
proposition
really
it
and
no
amount
of
failure
to
a
proposition
really
it
as
a
general
rule
the
burden
of
proof
rests
upon
the
person
stating
the
proposition
and
his
opponent
is
not
called
upon
to
disprove
it
or
else
have
it
considered
proved
the
old
cry
of
you
can
not
that
it
is
so
is
based
upon
a
fallacious
conception
abuse
of
the
opponent
his
party
or
his
cause
this
is
no
real
argument
or
reasoning
it
is
akin
to
proving
a
point
by
beating
the
opponent
over
the
head
arguing
that
an
opponent
does
not
live
up
to
his
principles
is
no
argument
against
the
principles
he
advocates
a
man
may
advocate
the
principle
of
temperance
and
yet
drink
to
excess
this
simply
proves
that
he
preaches
better
than
he
practices
but
the
truth
of
the
principle
of
temperance
is
not
affected
in
any
way
thereby
the
proof
of
this
is
that
he
may
change
his
practices
and
it
can
not
be
held
that
the
change
of
his
personal
habits
improves
or
changes
the
nature
of
the
principle
argument
of
authority
is
not
based
on
logic
authority
is
valuable
when
really
worthy
and
merely
as
corroboration
or
adding
weight
but
it
is
not
logical
argument
the
of
the
authority
alone
constitute
a
real
argument
the
abuse
of
this
form
of
argument
is
shown
in
the
above
reference
to
begging
the
question
in
the
quotation
from
bulwer
appeal
to
prejudice
or
public
opinion
is
not
a
valid
argument
for
public
opinion
is
frequently
wrong
and
prejudice
is
often
unwarranted
and
at
the
best
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
from
the
standpoint
of
logic
the
abuse
of
testimony
and
claimed
evidence
is
also
worthy
of
examination
but
we
can
not
go
into
the
subject
here
fallacies
of
prejudice
but
perhaps
the
most
dangerous
of
all
fallacies
in
the
search
for
truth
on
the
part
of
the
most
of
us
are
those
which
arise
from
the
following
the
tendency
to
reason
from
what
we
feel
and
wish
to
be
true
rather
than
from
the
actual
facts
of
the
case
which
causes
us
unconsciously
to
assume
the
mental
attitude
of
if
the
facts
agree
with
our
likes
and
pet
theories
all
is
well
if
they
do
not
so
much
the
worse
for
the
facts
the
tendency
in
all
of
us
to
perceive
only
the
facts
that
agree
with
our
theories
and
to
ignore
the
others
we
find
that
for
which
we
seek
and
overlook
that
which
does
not
interest
us
our
discoveries
follow
our
interest
and
our
interest
follows
our
desires
and
beliefs
the
intelligent
man
or
woman
realizes
these
tendencies
of
human
nature
and
endeavors
to
avoid
them
in
his
or
her
own
reasoning
but
is
keenly
conscious
of
them
in
the
arguments
and
reasoning
of
others
a
failure
to
observe
and
guard
one
self
against
these
tendencies
results
in
bigotry
intolerance
narrowness
and
intellectual
astigmatism
chapter
xxix
the
will
the
activities
of
the
will
comprise
the
third
great
class
of
mental
processes
psychologists
always
have
differed
greatly
in
their
conception
of
just
what
constitutes
these
activities
even
it
is
difficult
to
obtain
a
dictionary
definition
of
the
will
that
agrees
with
the
best
opinion
on
the
subject
the
dictionaries
adhere
to
the
old
classification
and
conception
which
regarded
the
will
as
that
faculty
of
the
mind
or
soul
by
which
it
chooses
or
decides
but
with
the
growth
of
the
idea
that
the
will
acts
according
to
the
strongest
motive
and
that
the
motive
is
supplied
by
the
average
struck
between
the
desires
of
the
moment
under
the
supervision
of
the
intellect
the
conception
of
will
as
the
choosing
and
deciding
faculty
is
passing
from
favor
in
the
place
of
the
older
conception
has
come
the
newer
one
which
holds
that
the
will
is
primarily
concerned
with
it
is
difficult
to
place
the
will
in
the
category
of
mental
processes
but
it
is
generally
agreed
that
it
abides
in
the
very
center
of
the
mental
being
and
is
closely
associated
with
what
is
called
the
ego
or
self
the
will
seems
to
have
at
least
three
general
phases
viz
the
phase
of
desire
the
phase
of
deliberation
or
choice
and
the
phase
of
expression
in
action
in
order
to
understand
the
will
it
is
necessary
to
consider
each
of
these
three
phases
of
its
activities
desire
the
first
phase
of
will
which
is
called
desire
is
in
itself
somewhat
complex
on
its
lower
side
it
touches
and
in
fact
blends
into
feeling
and
emotion
its
center
consists
of
a
state
of
akin
to
that
of
a
coiled
spring
or
a
cat
crouching
ready
for
a
spring
on
its
higher
side
it
touches
penetrates
and
blends
into
the
other
phases
of
the
will
which
we
have
mentioned
desire
is
defined
as
a
feeling
emotion
or
excitement
of
the
mind
directed
toward
the
attainment
enjoyment
or
possession
of
some
object
from
which
pleasure
profit
or
gratification
is
expected
halleck
gives
us
the
following
excellent
conception
of
the
moving
spirit
of
desire
has
for
its
object
something
which
will
bring
pleasure
or
get
rid
of
pain
immediate
or
remote
for
the
individual
or
for
some
one
in
whom
he
is
interested
aversion
or
a
striving
away
from
something
is
merely
the
negative
aspect
of
in
halleck
statement
above
quoted
we
have
the
explanation
of
the
part
played
by
the
intellect
in
the
activities
of
will
the
intellect
is
able
to
perceive
the
relations
between
present
action
and
future
results
and
is
able
to
point
the
way
toward
the
suppression
of
some
desires
in
order
that
other
and
better
ones
may
be
manifested
it
also
serves
its
purposes
in
regulating
the
striking
of
the
average
between
conflicting
desires
without
the
intervention
of
the
intellect
the
temporary
desire
of
the
moment
would
invariably
be
acted
upon
without
regard
to
future
results
or
consequences
to
one
self
and
others
it
also
serves
to
point
out
the
course
of
action
calculated
to
give
the
most
satisfactory
expression
of
the
desire
while
it
is
a
fact
that
the
action
of
will
depends
almost
entirely
upon
the
motive
force
of
desire
it
is
likewise
true
that
desire
may
be
created
regulated
suppressed
and
even
killed
by
the
action
of
the
will
the
will
by
giving
or
refusing
attention
to
a
certain
class
of
desires
may
either
cause
them
to
grow
and
wax
strong
or
else
die
and
fade
away
it
must
be
remembered
however
that
this
use
of
the
will
itself
springs
from
another
set
of
desires
or
feelings
desire
is
aroused
by
feelings
or
emotions
rising
from
the
subconscious
planes
of
the
mind
and
seeking
expression
and
manifestation
we
have
considered
the
nature
of
the
feelings
and
emotions
in
previous
chapters
which
should
be
read
in
connection
with
the
present
one
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
feeling
or
emotional
side
of
desire
arises
from
either
inherited
race
memories
existing
as
instincts
or
from
the
memory
of
the
past
experiences
of
the
individual
in
some
cases
the
feeling
first
manifests
in
a
vague
unrest
caused
by
subconscious
promptings
and
excitement
then
the
imagination
pictures
the
object
of
the
feeling
or
certain
memory
images
connected
with
it
and
the
desire
thus
manifests
on
the
plane
of
consciousness
the
entrance
of
the
desire
feeling
into
consciousness
is
accompanied
by
that
peculiar
which
marks
the
second
phase
of
desire
this
tension
when
sufficiently
strong
passes
into
the
third
phase
of
desire
or
that
in
which
desire
blends
into
will
action
desire
in
this
stage
makes
a
demand
upon
will
for
expression
and
action
from
mere
feeling
and
tension
of
feeling
it
becomes
call
to
but
before
expression
and
action
are
given
to
it
the
second
phase
of
will
must
manifest
at
least
for
a
moment
this
second
phase
is
that
known
as
deliberation
or
the
weighing
and
balancing
of
desires
deliberation
the
second
phase
of
will
known
as
deliberation
is
more
than
the
purely
intellectual
process
which
the
term
would
indicate
the
intellect
plays
an
important
part
it
is
true
but
there
is
also
an
almost
instinctive
and
automatic
and
balancing
of
there
is
seldom
only
one
desire
presenting
its
claims
upon
the
will
at
any
particular
moment
it
is
true
that
occasionally
there
arises
an
emotional
desire
of
such
dominant
power
and
strength
that
it
crowds
out
every
other
claimant
at
the
bar
of
deliberation
but
such
instances
are
rare
and
as
a
rule
there
are
a
host
of
rival
claimants
each
insisting
upon
its
rights
in
the
matter
at
issue
in
the
man
of
weak
or
undeveloped
and
untrained
intellect
the
struggle
is
usually
little
more
than
a
brief
combat
between
several
desires
in
which
strongest
at
the
moment
but
with
the
development
of
intellect
new
factors
arise
and
new
forces
are
felt
moreover
the
more
complex
one
emotional
nature
and
the
greater
the
development
of
the
higher
forms
of
feeling
the
more
intense
is
the
struggle
of
deliberation
or
the
fight
of
the
desires
we
see
in
halleck
definition
that
desire
has
not
only
the
object
of
bringing
pleasure
or
getting
rid
of
pain
for
the
individual
but
that
the
additional
element
of
the
welfare
of
some
one
in
whom
he
is
interested
is
added
which
element
is
often
the
deciding
factor
this
element
of
course
arises
from
the
development
and
cultivation
of
emotional
nature
in
the
same
way
we
also
see
that
it
is
not
merely
the
welfare
of
one
self
or
those
in
whom
one
is
interested
that
speaks
before
the
bar
but
also
the
more
welfare
this
consideration
of
future
welfare
depends
upon
the
intellect
and
cultivated
imagination
under
its
control
moreover
the
trained
intellect
is
able
to
discover
possible
greater
satisfaction
in
some
course
of
action
other
than
in
the
one
prompted
by
the
clamoring
desire
of
the
moment
this
explains
why
the
judgment
and
action
of
an
intelligent
man
as
a
rule
are
far
different
from
those
of
the
unintelligent
one
and
also
why
a
man
of
culture
tends
toward
different
action
from
that
of
the
uncultured
and
likewise
why
the
man
of
broad
sympathies
and
high
ideals
acts
in
a
different
way
from
one
of
the
opposite
type
but
the
principle
is
ever
the
same
the
feelings
manifest
in
desire
the
greatest
ultimate
satisfaction
apparent
at
the
moment
is
sought
and
the
strongest
set
of
desires
wins
the
day
halleck
comment
on
this
point
is
interesting
he
says
desire
is
not
always
proportional
to
the
idea
of
one
own
selfish
pleasure
many
persons
after
forming
an
idea
of
the
vast
amount
of
earthly
distress
desire
to
relieve
it
and
the
desire
goes
out
in
action
as
the
benevolent
societies
in
every
city
testify
here
the
individual
pleasure
is
none
the
less
but
it
is
secondary
coming
from
the
pleasure
of
others
the
desire
of
the
often
raises
a
stronger
desire
than
the
a
child
frequently
prefers
a
thing
immediately
if
it
is
only
one
tenth
as
good
as
something
he
might
have
a
year
hence
a
student
often
desires
more
the
leisure
of
than
the
success
of
future
years
though
admonished
to
study
he
wastes
his
time
and
thus
loses
incomparably
greater
future
pleasure
when
he
is
tossed
to
the
rear
in
the
struggle
for
existence
the
result
of
this
weighing
and
balancing
of
the
desire
is
or
should
be
and
which
then
passes
into
action
but
many
persons
seem
unable
to
make
up
their
own
mind
and
require
a
push
or
urge
from
without
before
they
will
act
others
decide
without
proper
use
of
the
intellect
upon
what
they
call
impulse
but
which
is
merely
impatience
some
are
like
the
fabled
donkey
which
starved
to
death
when
placed
at
an
equal
distance
between
two
equally
attractive
haystacks
and
was
unable
to
decide
towards
which
to
move
others
follow
the
example
of
jeppe
in
the
comedy
who
when
given
a
coin
with
which
to
buy
a
piece
of
soap
for
his
wife
stood
on
the
corner
deliberating
whether
to
obey
orders
or
to
buy
a
drink
with
the
money
he
wants
the
drink
but
realizes
that
his
wife
will
beat
him
if
he
returns
without
the
soap
my
stomach
says
drink
my
back
says
soap
says
jeppe
but
finally
he
remarks
is
not
a
man
stomach
more
to
him
than
his
back
yes
says
i
the
final
decision
depends
upon
the
striking
a
balance
between
the
desires
the
weighing
of
desire
for
and
desire
against
desire
for
this
and
desire
for
something
else
the
strength
of
the
several
desires
depends
upon
nearness
and
present
interest
arising
from
attention
as
applied
to
the
feelings
and
emotions
arising
from
heredity
environment
experience
and
education
which
constitute
character
and
also
upon
the
degree
of
intellectual
clearness
and
power
in
forming
correct
judgments
between
the
desires
it
must
be
remembered
however
that
the
intellect
appears
not
as
an
opponent
of
the
principle
of
the
satisfaction
of
desire
but
merely
as
an
instrument
of
the
ego
in
determining
which
course
of
action
will
result
in
the
greatest
ultimate
satisfaction
direct
or
indirect
present
or
future
for
the
last
every
individual
acts
so
as
to
bring
himself
the
greatest
satisfaction
immediate
or
future
direct
or
indirect
either
personal
or
through
the
welfare
of
others
as
this
may
appear
to
him
at
the
particular
moment
of
we
always
act
in
the
direction
of
that
which
will
greater
content
our
spirit
this
will
be
found
to
be
the
spirit
of
all
decisions
although
the
motive
is
often
hidden
and
difficult
to
find
even
by
the
individual
himself
many
of
the
strongest
motives
having
their
origin
in
the
subconscious
planes
of
mentality
action
the
third
and
final
phase
of
will
is
that
known
as
action
the
act
of
volition
by
which
the
is
expressed
in
physical
or
mental
activity
the
old
conception
of
the
will
held
that
the
decisive
phase
of
the
will
was
its
characteristic
and
final
phase
ignoring
the
fact
that
the
very
essence
or
spirit
of
will
is
bound
up
with
even
those
familiar
with
the
newer
conception
frequently
assume
that
the
act
of
decision
is
the
final
phase
of
will
ignoring
the
fact
that
we
frequently
to
do
a
thing
and
yet
may
never
carry
out
the
intention
and
decision
the
act
of
willing
is
not
complete
unless
action
is
expressed
there
must
be
the
manifestation
of
the
motor
element
or
phase
of
will
else
the
will
process
is
incomplete
a
weakness
of
this
last
phase
of
will
affects
the
entire
will
and
renders
its
processes
ineffective
the
world
is
filled
with
persons
who
are
able
to
what
is
best
to
do
and
what
should
be
done
but
who
never
actually
upon
the
decision
the
few
persons
who
promptly
follow
up
the
decision
with
vigorous
action
are
those
who
accomplish
the
world
work
without
the
full
manifestation
of
this
third
phase
of
will
the
other
two
phases
are
useless
types
of
will
so
far
we
have
considered
merely
the
highest
type
of
will
that
which
is
accompanied
by
conscious
deliberation
in
which
the
intellect
takes
an
active
part
in
this
process
not
only
do
the
conflicting
feelings
push
themselves
forward
with
opposing
claims
for
recognition
but
the
intellect
is
active
in
examining
the
case
and
offering
valuable
testimony
as
to
the
comparative
merits
of
the
various
claimants
and
the
effect
of
certain
courses
of
action
upon
the
individual
there
are
however
several
lower
forms
of
will
manifestation
which
we
should
briefly
consider
in
passing
the
will
is
moved
to
action
by
the
reflex
activities
of
the
nervous
system
which
have
been
mentioned
in
the
earlier
chapters
of
this
book
in
this
general
type
we
find
unconscious
reflex
action
such
as
that
manifested
when
a
sleeper
is
touched
and
moves
away
or
when
the
frog
leg
twitches
when
the
nerve
end
is
excited
we
also
find
conscious
reflex
action
such
as
that
manifested
by
the
winking
of
the
eye
or
the
performance
of
habitual
physical
motion
such
as
the
movement
in
walking
operating
the
sewing
machine
or
typewriter
playing
the
piano
etc
the
will
is
often
moved
to
action
by
a
dim
idea
or
faint
perception
of
purpose
or
impulse
the
action
is
almost
instinctive
although
there
is
a
vague
perception
of
purpose
for
instance
we
feel
an
impulse
to
turn
toward
the
source
of
a
strange
sound
or
sight
or
other
source
of
interest
or
curiosity
or
we
may
feel
an
impulse
arising
from
the
subconscious
plane
of
our
mind
causing
a
idea
of
movement
or
action
to
relieve
the
tension
for
instance
one
may
feel
a
desire
to
exercise
or
to
seek
fresh
air
or
green
fields
although
he
had
not
been
thinking
of
these
things
at
the
time
these
impulses
arise
from
a
subconscious
feeling
of
fatigue
or
desire
for
change
which
added
to
a
fleeting
idea
produces
the
impulse
unless
an
impulse
is
inhibited
by
the
will
activities
inspired
by
other
desires
habits
ideas
or
ideals
we
act
upon
it
in
precisely
the
same
way
that
a
young
child
or
animal
does
hoffding
says
of
this
type
of
action
the
psychological
condition
of
the
impulse
is
that
with
the
momentary
feeling
and
sensation
should
be
combined
a
more
or
less
clear
idea
of
something
which
may
augment
the
pleasure
or
diminish
the
pain
of
the
moment
the
will
is
frequently
moved
to
action
by
an
instinctive
stimulus
this
form
of
will
activity
closely
resembles
the
last
mentioned
form
and
often
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
between
the
two
the
activities
of
the
bee
in
building
its
comb
and
storing
its
honey
the
work
of
the
silkworm
and
caterpillar
in
building
their
resting
places
are
examples
of
this
form
of
action
indeed
even
the
building
of
the
nest
of
the
bird
may
be
so
classed
in
these
cases
there
is
an
intelligent
action
toward
a
definite
end
but
the
animal
is
unconscious
of
that
end
the
experiences
of
the
remote
ancestors
of
these
creatures
recorded
their
impressions
upon
the
subconscious
mind
of
the
species
and
they
are
transmitted
in
some
way
to
all
of
that
species
the
nervous
system
of
every
living
thing
is
a
record
cylinder
of
the
experiences
of
its
early
ancestors
and
these
cylinders
tend
to
reproduce
these
impressions
upon
appropriate
occasions
in
preceding
chapters
we
have
shown
that
even
man
is
under
the
influence
of
instinct
to
a
greater
extent
than
he
imagines
himself
to
be
chapter
xxx
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
the
individual
develop
cultivate
and
train
his
will
so
as
to
bring
it
under
the
influence
of
the
higher
part
of
his
mental
and
moral
being
while
the
will
is
used
most
effectively
in
developing
and
training
the
intellect
and
building
character
it
itself
must
be
trained
by
itself
to
habitually
come
under
the
guidance
of
the
intellect
and
under
the
influence
of
that
which
we
call
character
the
influence
of
the
trained
will
upon
the
several
mental
faculties
is
most
marked
there
are
no
faculties
which
may
not
be
cultivated
by
the
will
the
first
and
great
task
of
the
will
in
this
direction
is
the
control
and
direction
of
the
attention
the
will
determines
the
kind
of
interest
that
shall
prevail
at
the
moment
and
the
kind
of
interest
largely
determines
the
character
of
the
man
his
tastes
his
feelings
his
thoughts
his
acts
gordy
says
coÃ¶perating
with
a
influence
the
will
can
make
a
weaker
one
prevail
over
a
stronger
it
determines
which
of
influences
shall
have
control
over
the
mind
moreover
concentrated
and
continued
attention
depends
entirely
upon
the
exercise
of
the
will
as
gordy
says
if
the
will
relaxes
its
hold
upon
the
activities
of
the
mind
the
attention
is
liable
to
be
carried
away
by
any
one
of
the
thousands
of
ideas
that
the
laws
of
association
are
constantly
bringing
into
our
minds
even
in
the
matter
of
mental
images
the
will
asserts
its
sway
and
the
imagination
may
be
trained
to
be
the
obedient
servant
of
the
developed
will
regarding
the
influence
of
the
will
upon
character
davidson
says
it
is
not
enough
for
a
man
to
understand
correctly
and
love
duly
the
conditions
of
moral
life
in
his
own
time
he
must
still
further
be
willing
and
able
to
fulfill
these
conditions
and
he
certainly
can
not
do
this
unless
his
will
is
trained
to
perfect
freedom
so
that
it
responds
with
the
utmost
readiness
to
the
suggestions
of
his
discriminating
intelligence
and
the
movements
of
his
chastened
affections
halleck
says
we
gradually
make
our
characters
by
separate
acts
of
will
just
as
a
blacksmith
by
repeated
blows
beats
out
a
horseshoe
or
an
anchor
from
a
shapeless
mass
of
iron
a
finished
anchor
or
horseshoe
was
never
the
product
of
a
single
blow
training
the
will
perhaps
the
best
way
to
train
the
will
is
to
it
intelligently
and
with
a
purpose
the
training
of
any
faculty
of
the
mind
is
at
the
same
time
a
training
of
the
will
the
attention
being
so
closely
allied
to
the
will
it
follows
that
a
careful
training
of
attention
will
result
in
a
strengthening
of
the
will
the
training
of
the
emotional
side
of
nature
also
brings
results
in
the
strengthening
of
the
will
halleck
gives
his
students
excellent
advice
regarding
the
training
of
the
will
it
would
be
hard
to
find
anything
better
along
these
lines
than
the
following
from
his
pen
nothing
schools
the
will
and
renders
it
ready
for
effort
in
this
complex
world
better
than
accustoming
it
to
face
disagreeable
things
professor
james
advises
all
to
do
something
occasionally
for
no
other
reason
than
that
they
would
rather
not
do
it
if
it
is
nothing
more
than
giving
up
a
seat
in
a
street
car
he
likens
such
effort
to
the
insurance
that
a
man
pays
on
his
house
he
has
something
that
he
can
fall
back
on
in
time
of
trouble
a
will
schooled
in
this
way
is
always
ready
to
respond
no
matter
how
great
the
emergency
while
another
would
be
crying
over
spilled
milk
the
possessor
of
such
a
will
has
already
found
another
cow
the
only
way
to
secure
such
a
will
is
to
practice
doing
disagreeable
things
there
are
daily
opportunities
a
man
who
had
declared
his
aversion
to
what
he
deemed
the
dry
facts
of
political
economy
was
one
day
found
knitting
his
brow
over
a
chapter
of
john
stuart
mill
when
a
friend
expressed
surprise
the
man
replied
am
playing
the
schoolmaster
with
myself
i
am
reading
this
because
i
dislike
it
such
a
man
has
the
elements
of
success
in
him
on
the
other
hand
the
one
who
habitually
avoids
disagreeable
action
is
training
his
will
to
be
of
no
use
to
him
at
a
time
when
supreme
effort
is
demanded
such
a
will
can
never
elbow
its
way
to
the
front
in
life
habits
habits
are
the
beaten
track
over
which
the
will
travels
the
beaten
path
of
habit
is
the
line
of
least
resistance
to
the
will
one
who
would
train
his
will
must
needs
pay
attention
to
providing
it
with
the
proper
mental
paths
over
which
to
travel
the
rule
for
the
creation
of
habits
is
simply
this
over
the
mental
path
as
often
as
the
rule
for
breaking
undesirable
habits
is
this
the
opposite
in
these
two
rules
is
expressed
the
gist
of
what
has
been
written
on
the
subject
professor
william
james
has
left
to
the
world
some
invaluable
advice
regarding
the
cultivation
of
right
habits
he
bases
his
rules
upon
those
of
professor
bain
elaborates
these
and
adds
some
equally
good
ones
we
herewith
quote
freely
from
both
james
and
bain
on
this
subject
it
is
the
best
ever
written
regarding
habit
building
i
in
the
acquisition
of
a
new
habit
or
the
leaving
off
of
an
old
one
launch
yourself
with
as
strong
and
decided
an
initiative
as
possible
this
will
give
your
new
beginning
such
a
momentum
that
the
temptation
to
break
down
will
not
occur
as
soon
as
it
otherwise
might
and
every
day
during
which
a
breakdown
is
postponed
adds
to
the
chances
of
it
not
occurring
at
all
ii
never
suffer
an
exception
to
occur
till
the
new
habit
is
securely
rooted
in
your
life
every
lapse
is
like
the
letting
fall
of
a
ball
of
string
which
one
is
carefully
winding
up
a
single
slip
undoes
more
than
a
great
many
turns
will
wind
again
it
is
necessary
above
all
things
in
such
a
situation
never
to
lose
a
battle
every
gain
on
the
wrong
side
undoes
the
effect
of
many
conquests
on
the
right
the
essential
precaution
is
so
to
regulate
the
two
opposing
powers
that
the
one
may
have
a
series
of
uninterrupted
successes
until
repetition
has
fortified
it
to
such
a
degree
as
to
enable
it
to
cope
with
the
opposition
under
any
circumstances
iii
seize
the
very
first
possible
opportunity
to
act
on
every
resolution
you
make
and
on
every
emotional
prompting
you
may
experience
in
the
direction
of
the
habits
you
aspire
to
gain
it
is
not
in
the
moment
of
their
forming
but
in
the
moment
of
their
producing
that
resolves
and
aspirations
communicate
their
new
to
the
brain
the
actual
presence
of
the
practical
opportunity
alone
furnishes
the
fulcrum
upon
which
the
lever
can
rest
by
which
the
moral
will
may
multiply
its
strength
and
raise
itself
aloft
he
who
has
no
solid
ground
to
press
against
will
never
get
beyond
the
stage
of
empty
gesture
making
iv
keep
the
faculty
alive
in
you
by
a
little
gratuitous
exercise
every
day
that
is
be
systematically
ascetic
or
heroic
in
little
unnecessary
points
do
every
day
something
for
no
other
reason
than
that
you
would
rather
not
do
it
so
that
when
the
hour
of
dire
need
draws
nigh
it
may
find
you
not
unnerved
and
untrained
to
stand
the
test
the
man
who
has
daily
inured
himself
to
habits
of
concentrated
attention
energetic
volition
and
in
unnecessary
things
will
stand
like
a
tower
when
everything
rocks
around
him
and
when
his
softer
fellow
mortals
are
winnowed
like
chaff
in
the
blast
chapter
xxxi
in
addition
to
the
general
rules
for
developing
and
training
the
will
given
in
the
preceding
chapter
we
ask
you
to
tone
up
and
strengthen
the
will
by
the
inspiration
to
be
derived
from
the
words
of
some
of
the
world
great
thinkers
and
doers
in
these
words
there
is
such
a
vital
statement
of
the
recognition
realization
and
manifestation
of
that
something
within
which
we
call
will
that
it
is
a
dull
soul
indeed
which
is
not
inspired
by
the
contagion
of
the
idea
these
expressions
are
the
milestones
on
the
path
of
attainment
placed
by
those
who
have
preceded
us
on
the
journey
we
submit
these
quotations
without
comment
they
speak
for
themselves
words
of
the
wise
they
can

perfectly
educated

within

a
power
a
living
force
which
the
more
you
trust
and
learn
to
use
will
annihilate
the
opposition
of

the
star
of
the
unconquered
will
it
rises
in
my
breast
serene
and
resolute
and
still
and
calm
and
so
nigh
is
grandeur
to
our
dust
so
near
is
god
to
man
when
duty
whispers
low
must
the
youth
replies
can
the
longer
i
live
the
more
certain
i
am
that
the
great
difference
between
men
between
the
feeble
and
the
powerful
the
great
and
the
insignificant
is
energy
invincible
determination
a
purpose
once
fixed
and
then
death
or
victory
that
quality
will
do
anything
that
can
be
done
in
this
world
and
no
talents
no
circumstances
no
opportunities
will
make
a
creature
a
man
without
it
the
human
will
that
force
unseen
the
offspring
of
a
deathless
soul
can
hew
a
way
to
any
goal
though
walls
of
granite
intervene
you
will
be
what
you
will
to
be
let
failure
find
its
false
content
in
that
poor
word
environment
but
spirit
scorns
it
and
is
free
it
masters

it
conquers
space
it
cows
that
boastful
trickster
chance
and
bids
the
tyrant

fill
a

place
resolve
is
what
makes
a
man
manifest
not
puny
resolve
not
crude
determinations
not
errant
purpose
but
that
strong
and
indefatigable
will
which
treads
down
difficulties
and
danger
as
a
boy
treads
down
the
heaving
frost
lands
of
winter
which
kindles
his
eye
and
brain
with
a
proud
pulse
beat
toward
the
unattainable
will
makes
men
giants
there
is
no
chance
no
destiny
no
fate
can
circumvent
or
hinder
or
control
the
firm
resolve
of
a
determined
soul
gifts
count
for
nothing
will
alone
is
great
all
things
give
way
before
it
soon
or

what
obstacle
can
stay
the
mighty
force
of
the
river
in
its
course
or
cause
the
ascending
orb
of
day
to
wait
each
soul
must
win
what
it
deserves
let
the
fools
prate
of
luck
the
fortunate
is
he
whose
earnest
purpose
never
swerves
whose
slightest
action
or
inaction
serves
the
one
great
aim
why
even
death
itself
stands
still
and
waits
an
hour
sometimes
for
such
a
will
wheeler
i
have
brought
myself
by
long
meditation
to
the
conviction
that
a
human
being
with
a
settled
purpose
must
accomplish
it
and
that
nothing
can
resist
a
will
which
will
stake
even
existence
upon
its
fulfillment
a
passionate
desire
and
an
unwearied
will
can
perform
impossibilities
or
what
may
seem
to
be
such
to
the
cold
and
feeble
john
it
is
wonderful
how
even
the
casualties
of
life
seem
to
bow
to
a
spirit
that
will
not
bow
to
them
and
yield
to
subserve
a
design
which
they
may
in
their
first
apparent
tendency
threaten
to
frustrate
when
a
firm
decisive
spirit
is
recognized
it
is
curious
to
see
how
the
space
clears
around
a
man
and
leaves
him
room
and
freedom
the
great
thing
about
general
grant
is
cool
persistency
of
purpose
he
is
not
easily
excited
and
he
has
got
the
grip
of
a
bulldog
when
he
once
gets
his
teeth
in
nothing
can
shake
him
off
i
am
bigger
than
anything
that
can
happen
to
me
all
these
things
are
outside
my
door
i
got
the
man
was
meant
to
be
and
ought
to
be
stronger
and
more
than
anything
that
can
happen
to
him
circumstances
are
all
outside
and
if
he
can
not
change
them
he
can
always
them
the
truest
wisdom
is
a
resolute
determination
impossible
is
a
word
found
only
in
the
dictionary
of
fools

circumstances
he
who
fails
only
half
wills
that
which
the
easiest
becomes
a
habit
in
us
is
the
will
learn
then
to
will
strongly
and
decisively
thus
fix
your
floating
life
and
leave
it
no
longer
to
be
carried
hither
and
thither
like
a
withered
leaf
by
every
wind
that
blows
man
owes
his
growth
chiefly
to
that
active
striving
of
the
will
that
encounter
which
we
call
effort
and
it
is
astonishing
to
find
how
often
results
apparently
impracticable
are
thus
made
possible
it
is
will
force
of
purpose
that
enables
a
man
to
do
or
be
whatever
he
sets
his
mind
upon
being
or
doing
a
strong
defiant
purpose
is
and
lays
hold
of
whatever
is
near
that
can
serve
it
it
has
a
magnetic
purpose
that
draws
to
itself
whatever
is
kindred
let
it
be
your

the

that
