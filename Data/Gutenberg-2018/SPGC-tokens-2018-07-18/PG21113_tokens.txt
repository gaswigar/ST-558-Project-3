avenger
bill
bill
is
this
you
or
your
ghost
what
in
great
creation
name
are
you
doing
here
gettin
toward
sunset
old
pard
gettin
toward
sunset
before
i
pass
in
my
checks
the
first
speaker
was
an
old
scout
and
plainsman
sam
chichester
by
name
and
he
spoke
to
a
passenger
who
had
just
left
the
express
train
at
laramie
on
the
that
passenger
was
none
other
than
j
hickok
or
wild
bill
one
of
the
most
noted
shots
and
certainly
the
most
desperate
man
of
his
age
and
day
west
of
the
mississippi
river
what
do
you
mean
bill
when
you
talk
of
passing
in
your
checks
in
the
very
prime
of
life
man
and
hush
talk
low
there
are
listening
ears
everywhere
sam
i
do
know
why
but
there
is
a
chill
at
my
heart
and
i
know
my
time
has
about
run
out
i
been
on
east
with
buffalo
bill
and
texas
jack
trying
to
show
people
what
our
plains
life
is
but
i
was
at
home
there
there
were
crowds
on
crowds
that
came
to
see
us
and
i
could
stir
on
the
streets
of
their
big
cities
without
having
an
army
at
my
heels
and
i
got
sick
of
it
but
that
was
all
there
was
a
woman
that
fell
in
love
with
me
and
made
up
her
mind
to
marry
me
i
told
her
that
i
was
no
sort
of
a
man
to
tie
to
that
i
was
likely
to
be
wiped
out
any
day
sunrise
and
sunset
for
i
had
more
enemies
than
a
candidate
for
president
but
she
would
listen
to
sense
and
so
buckled
thank
heaven
coaxed
her
to
stay
east
with
friends
while
i
come
out
here
for
sam
she
be
a
widow
inside
of
six
weeks
bill
you
been
hitting
benzine
heavy
of
late
have
you
no
i
never
drank
lighter
in
my
life
than
i
have
for
a
year
past
but
there
a
shadow
cold
as
ice
on
my
soul
i
never
felt
right
since
i
pulled
on
that
texan
at
abilene
in
kansas
you
remember
for
you
was
there
it
was
kill
or
get
killed
you
know
and
when
i
let
him
have
his
ticket
for
a
lot
of
ground
he
gave
one
shriek
it
rings
in
my
ears
yet
he
spoke
but
one
word
yet
that
word
has
never
left
my
ears
sleeping
or
waking
from
that
time
to
this
i
had
a
sister
once
myself
sam
and
i
loved
her
a
thousand
times
more
than
i
did
life
in
fact
i
never
loved
life
after
i
lost
her
and
i
ca
tell
you
all
about
her
i
choke
if
i
tried
it
is
enough
that
she
died
and
the
cause
of
her
death
died
soon
after
and
i
was
far
away
when
when
he
went
under
but
that
is
here
nor
there
sam
let
go
and
warm
up
where
do
you
hang
out
i
in
camp
close
by
i
heading
a
party
that
is
bound
in
for
the
black
hills
captain
jack
crawford
is
along
you
know
him
and
california
joe
too
good
it
is
the
first
streak
of
luck
i
had
in
a
year
i
join
your
crowd
sam
if
you
let
me
captain
jack
and
joe
are
as
good
friends
as
i
ever
had
always
barring
one
and
that
is
my
old
here
i
call
it
it
never
speaks
without
saying
something
but
come
old
boy
i
see
a
sign
ahead
i
must
take
in
a
little
benzine
to
wash
the
out
of
my
throat
bill
pointed
to
a
saloon
near
at
hand
and
the
two
old
scouts
and
companions
moved
toward
it
as
they
did
so
a
young
man
roughly
dressed
with
a
face
fair
and
smooth
though
shadowed
as
if
by
exposure
to
sun
and
and
wind
stepped
from
behind
a
shade
tree
where
he
had
stood
while
these
two
talked
listening
with
breathless
interest
to
every
word
his
hair
a
deep
rich
auburn
hung
in
curling
masses
clear
to
his
shoulders
and
his
blue
eyes
seemed
to
burn
with
almost
feverish
fire
as
he
gazed
in
the
direction
the
scouts
had
taken
so
he
remembers
abilene
does
he
and
the
tone
of
the
young
man
was
low
and
fierce
us
an
angered
hiss
and
he
thinks
his
time
is
near
so
do
i
but
he
shall
not
die
in
a
second
as
his
victim
did
i
would
prolong
his
agonies
for
years
if
every
hour
was
like
a
living
death
a
speechless
misery
let
him
go
with
sam
chichester
and
his
crowd
the
avenger
will
be
close
at
hand
his
will
lie
when
he
most
depends
on
it
for
i
i
have
sworn
that
he
shall
go
where
he
has
sent
so
many
victims
go
like
them
all
unprepared
but
not
unwarned
no
he
thinks
that
death
is
near
freeze
the
thought
to
his
very
soul
he
is
on
the
now
with
me
rests
when
and
where
it
shall
end
the
face
of
the
young
man
was
almost
fiendish
in
its
expression
as
he
spoke
it
seemed
as
if
his
heart
was
the
concentration
of
hate
and
a
fell
desire
for
revenge
he
strode
along
the
streets
swiftly
and
glancing
in
at
the
saloon
which
the
two
men
had
entered
paused
one
second
with
his
right
hand
thrust
within
his
vest
as
if
clutching
a
weapon
and
debating
in
his
mind
whether
or
not
to
use
it
a
second
only
he
paused
and
then
muttering
it
is
not
time
yet
he
passed
on
he
went
a
little
way
up
the
same
street
and
entered
a
german
restaurant
throwing
himself
heavily
on
a
seat
he
said
give
me
a
steak
quick
i
hungry
and
dry
give
me
a
bottle
of
the
best
brandy
in
your
house
we
got
der
steak
und
pread
und
peer
und
rhein
wine
but
no
prandy
said
the
german
who
kept
the
place
cook
the
steak
in
a
hurry
and
send
for
some
brandy
then
cried
the
young
man
throwing
down
a
golden
eagle
your
beer
and
wine
are
like
dishwater
to
me
i
want
fire
fire
in
my
veins
now
dunder
and
blixen
i
should
dink
as
you
wus
want
much
more
fire
as
dere
is
in
your
eyes
young
fellow
but
i
send
for
your
prandy
the
young
man
threw
one
glance
around
the
room
to
see
if
he
were
the
only
occupant
there
was
another
person
there
one
who
had
evidently
just
come
in
a
traveler
judging
by
a
valise
that
was
on
the
floor
beside
his
chair
this
person
looked
young
for
the
face
or
as
much
of
it
as
was
not
hidden
by
a
very
full
black
beard
was
fair
and
smooth
as
that
of
a
woman
while
the
hair
which
shaded
his
white
brow
was
dark
as
night
soft
and
glossy
as
silk
hanging
on
short
curling
masses
about
his
face
and
neck
he
was
dressed
rather
better
than
the
usual
run
of
travelers
in
a
good
black
suit
wore
a
heavy
gold
had
on
a
fine
linen
shirt
with
a
diamond
pin
in
the
bosom
and
appeared
to
feel
quite
satisfied
with
himself
from
the
cool
and
easy
manner
in
which
he
gave
his
orders
for
a
good
substantial
meal
in
a
voice
rather
low
and
musical
for
one
of
his
apparent
age
the
last
comer
eyed
this
person
very
closely
and
a
smile
almost
like
contempt
rose
on
his
face
when
the
stranger
called
for
claret
wine
or
if
they
had
not
that
for
a
cup
of
tea
but
his
own
strong
drink
was
now
brought
in
and
pouring
out
a
glassful
of
undiluted
brandy
he
drank
it
down
and
muttered
that
the
stuff
it
will
keep
up
the
fire
my
veins
would
stiffen
without
it
it
has
carried
me
so
far
and
it
must
to
the
end
then
no
matter
the
stranger
or
traveler
looked
as
if
wondering
that
the
young
man
could
take
such
a
fearful
dose
of
fiery
liquor
and
the
wonder
must
have
increased
when
a
second
glassful
was
drained
before
the
food
was
on
the
table
but
the
latter
came
in
now
and
the
traveler
and
the
young
man
with
auburn
hair
at
separate
tables
were
apparently
too
busy
in
disposing
of
the
eatables
to
take
any
further
notice
of
each
other
when
the
first
had
finished
he
took
a
roll
of
cigarettes
from
one
of
his
pockets
selected
one
took
a
match
from
a
silver
box
drawn
from
the
same
pocket
and
lighting
his
cigarette
threw
a
cloud
of
smoke
above
his
head
the
second
pouring
out
his
third
glass
of
brandy
sipped
it
quietly
the
first
two
glasses
having
evidently
supplied
the
fire
he
craved
so
fiercely
the
traveler
as
we
may
call
him
for
want
of
any
other
knowledge
now
rose
and
as
if
impelled
by
natural
politeness
tendered
a
cigarette
to
the
other
the
man
with
auburn
hair
looked
surprised
and
his
fierce
wild
face
softened
a
little
as
he
said
thank
you
no
i
drink
sometimes
like
a
fish
but
i
do
smoke
tobacco
shakes
the
nerves
they
say
and
i
want
my
nerves
steady
strong
drink
will
shake
them
more
i
heard
said
the
traveler
in
his
low
musical
voice
but
you
seem
to
have
a
steady
hand
though
you
take
brandy
as
if
used
to
it
my
hand
is
steady
stranger
was
the
reply
there
is
not
a
man
on
the
rio
grande
border
where
i
came
from
that
can
strike
a
center
at
twenty
paces
with
a
revolver
as
often
as
i
and
with
a
rifle
at
one
hundred
yards
i
can
most
generally
drop
a
deer
with
a
ball
between
his
eyes
if
he
is
looking
at
me
or
take
a
wild
turkey
head
without
hurting
his
body
then
you
are
from
texas
yes
sir
and
you
from
the
east
sir
i
have
traveled
in
the
south
all
over
in
fact
but
my
home
is
in
the
old
empire
state
if
it
is
impudent
which
way
are
you
bound
now
i
have
quite
decided
i
may
go
to
the
black
hills
may
remain
around
here
awhile
it
seems
to
be
rather
a
pleasant
place
yes
for
them
that
like
it
i
off
for
the
black
hills
myself
ah
with
a
company
not
much
but
there
a
company
going
i
one
of
them
that
do
care
much
for
company
and
can
take
better
care
of
myself
alone
than
with
a
crowd
about
me
so
well
it
is
a
good
thing
to
be
independent
do
you
know
the
party
that
is
going
some
of
by
sight
the
captain
is
sam
chichester
and
he
has
california
joe
jack
and
about
twenty
more
in
his
party
and
wild
bill
has
just
come
on
the
train
and
i
heard
him
say
he
was
going
with
the
crowd
wild
bill
cried
the
stranger
flushing
up
did
you
say
he
was
going
yes
then
i
like
to
go
too
but
i
like
to
go
with
another
party
either
just
before
or
behind
that
party
do
you
know
wild
bill
him
who
does
not
has
he
killed
more
men
than
any
other
white
man
in
the
states
and
territories
i
not
say
but
is
he
not
a
hyena
sopped
in
blood
you
do
not
like
him
who
says
i
do
do
your
eyes
flash
hate
while
you
speak
of
him
do
they
well
maybe
i
do
like
him
as
well
as
i
do
a
glass
of
brandy
maybe
i
have
lost
some
one
i
loved
by
his
hand
it
is
at
all
unlikely
the
traveler
sighed
and
with
an
anxious
look
said
you
do
bear
him
any
grudge
do
you
you
would
harm
him
a
strange
look
passes
like
a
flash
over
the
face
of
the
other
he
seemed
to
read
the
thoughts
or
wishes
of
the
traveler
in
a
glance
oh
no
he
said
with
assumed
carelessness
accidents
will
happen
in
the
best
families
it
not
in
me
to
bear
a
grudge
because
bill
may
have
wiped
out
fifteen
or
twenty
texans
while
they
were
foolin
around
in
his
way
as
to
harm
he
too
ready
with
his
old
he
calls
it
to
stand
in
much
danger
i
quick
but
he
is
quicker
you
take
a
good
deal
of
interest
in
him
do
you
know
him
yes
that
is
i
know
him
by
sight
he
is
thought
a
great
deal
of
by
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
and
that
is
why
i
feel
an
interest
in
him
and
that
friend
is
a
woman
why
do
you
think
so
it
is
a
fancy
of
mine
well
i
will
not
contradict
you
for
her
sake
i
would
hate
to
see
any
evil
befall
him
there
was
a
cynical
smile
on
the
face
of
the
young
man
with
auburn
hair
if
a
woman
loved
him
she
ought
not
to
leave
him
for
his
life
is
mighty
uncertain
said
the
latter
i
heard
him
say
to
captain
chichester
not
half
an
hour
ago
that
he
did
believe
he
would
live
long
and
such
a
man
as
he
is
sure
to
die
with
his
boots
on
did
he
say
that
asked
the
traveler
yes
and
he
seemed
to
feel
it
too
he
had
to
do
as
i
do
fire
up
with
something
strong
to
get
life
into
his
veins
poor
fellow
he
had
better
have
staid
east
when
he
was
there
away
from
this
wild
and
lawless
section
stranger
there
may
be
much
out
this
way
but
justice
always
blind
out
here
if
you
stay
long
enough
you
may
learn
that
very
likely
but
you
spoke
of
going
to
those
black
hills
yes
i
going
will
you
let
me
go
with
you
you
do
look
much
like
roughing
it
and
the
trip
is
not
only
hard
but
it
may
be
dangerous
the
redskins
are
beginning
to
act
wolfish
on
the
plains
i
think
i
can
stand
as
much
hardship
as
you
you
are
light
and
slender
but
tough
as
an
old
buffalo
bull
for
all
that
i
been
brought
up
in
the
saddle
with
rifle
and
lasso
in
hand
i
used
to
wind
and
weather
sunshine
and
storm
they
all
alike
to
me
and
indians
yes
to
comanche
kiowa
and
apache
but
these
cheyennes
and
sioux
are
a
tougher
breed
they
tell
me
i
soon
learn
them
too
i
reckon
there
one
thing
sure
i
do
go
in
no
crowd
of
twenty
or
thirty
with
wagons
or
pack
mules
along
to
tempt
the
cusses
with
while
they
make
the
travel
slow
you
want
either
a
big
crowd
or
a
very
small
one
if
you
travel
in
an
indian
country
you
have
not
answered
my
question
yet
will
you
let
me
go
through
to
the
black
hills
with
you
why
do
you
go
with
the
other
party
they
take
you
i
bet
i
do
not
want
to
go
where
wild
bill
will
see
me
he
may
think
his
wife
has
sent
me
as
a
spy
on
his
movements
and
actions
his
is
he
married
it
must
be
something
new
it
is
he
was
married
only
a
short
time
ago
to
a
woman
who
almost
worships
him
she
did
all
she
could
to
keep
him
from
going
out
into
his
old
life
again
but
she
could
not
you
go
with
me
said
the
other
abruptly
after
a
keen
and
searching
look
in
the
traveler
face
what
is
your
name
willie
pond
rather
a
pond
if
i
know
what
water
is
said
the
man
to
himself
and
then
he
asked
in
a
louder
tone
have
you
horse
and
arms
no
i
just
came
on
the
train
from
the
east
but
there
is
money
buy
me
a
good
horse
saddle
and
bridle
i
see
to
getting
arms
and
willie
pond
handed
the
other
a
dollar
treasury
note
you
do
ask
my
name
and
you
trust
me
with
money
as
if
you
knew
i
was
honest
you
tell
me
your
name
when
you
feel
like
it
was
the
rejoinder
as
to
your
honesty
if
i
think
you
are
safe
to
travel
with
you
safe
to
trust
my
money
with

rest
of
it
all
right
jack

your
own
time
and
now

all
ready
to

either
ahead
or
just
behind
the
other
party
we

ahead
where

all
right
this
old
dutchman

and
if

bill
to
see
you
keep
pretty
close
in
doors
he
be
out
in
the
black
hillers
camp
or
in
the
saloons
where
they
sell
benzine
and
run
faro
banks
bill
is
death
on
cards
so
i
heard
said
pond
with
a
sigh
jack
now
went
out
and
pond
called
the
dutch
landlord
to
him
and
engaged
a
room
chapter
ii
persimmon
bill
as
soon
as
the
man
who
called
himself
jack
had
left
the
german
restaurant
he
went
to
a
near
by
called
for
his
own
horse
which
was
kept
there
and
the
instant
it
was
saddled
he
mounted
and
at
a
gallop
rode
westward
from
the
town
he
did
not
draw
rein
for
full
an
hour
and
then
he
had
covered
somewhere
between
eight
and
ten
miles
of
ground
following
no
course
or
trail
but
riding
in
a
course
as
straight
as
the
flight
of
an
arrow
he
halted
then
in
a
small
ravine
nearly
hidden
by
a
growth
of
thick
brush
and
gave
a
peculiar
whistle
thrice
had
this
sounded
when
a
man
came
cautiously
out
of
the
ravine
or
rather
out
of
its
mouth
he
was
tall
slender
yet
seemed
to
possess
the
bone
and
muscle
of
a
giant
his
eyes
were
jet
black
fierce
and
flashing
and
his
face
had
a
stern
almost
classic
beauty
of
feature
which
would
have
made
him
a
model
in
the
ancient
age
of
sculpture
he
carried
a
repeating
rifle
two
revolvers
and
a
knife
in
his
belt
his
dress
was
buckskin
from
head
to
foot
you
are
persimmon
bill
said
jack
in
a
tone
of
inquiry
yes
who
are
you
and
how
came
you
by
the
signal
that
called
me
out
a
woman
in
town
gave
it
to
me
knowing
she
could
trust
me
was
her
first
name
addie
her
last
name
was
neidic
all
right
i
see
she
has
trusted
you

want
help
in
a
matter
of
revenge
good
you
can
have
it
how
much
help
is
wanted
i
want
one
man
taken
from
a
party
alive
when
he
gets
beyond
civilized
help
so
that
i
can
see
him
tortured
i
want
him
to
die
by
inches
how
large
is
his
party
and
where
are
they
now
the
party
numbers
between
twenty
and
thirty
they
are
in
camp
in
the
edge
of
laramie
and
will
start
for
the
black
hills
in
a
few
days
if
all
the
party
are
wiped
out
but
the
one
you
want
will
it
matter
to
you
no
they
are
his
friends
and
as
such
i
hate
them
all
right
get
me
a
list
of
their
numbers
and
names
how
armed
what
animals
and
stores
they
have
every
fact
so
i
can
be
ready
they
will
never
get
more
than
half
way
to
the
hills
and
the
one
you
want
shall
be
delivered
bound
into
your
hands
all
this
and
more
will
i
do
for
her
who
sent
you
here

love
her
she
loves
me
i
not
one
to
waste
much
breath
on
talking
love
my
ogallalla
sioux
warriors
know
me
as
the
be
cautious
when
you
go
back
and
give
no
hint
to
any
one
but
addie
neidic
that
there
is
a
living
being
in
dead
man
hollow
for
so
this
ravine
is
called
in
there

safe
for

no
one

knew

neidic
before
i
came
here
met
her
by
accident
revealed
myself
and
wants
and
she
sent
me
to
you
it
is
right
go
back
and
be
cautious
to
give
the
signal
if
you
seek
me
or
you
might
lose
your
scalp
before
you
saw
me
my
scalp
yes
my
guards
are
vigilant
and
rough
your
guards
persimmon
bill
laughed
at
the
look
of
wonder
in
the
face
of
his
visitor
and
with
his
hand
to
his
mouth
gave
a
shrill
warbling
cry
in
a
second
this
mouth
of
the
ravine
was
fairly
blocked
with
armed
and
painted
warriors
sioux
of
the
ogallalla
tribe
there
were
not
less
than
fifty
of
them
you
see
my
guards
red
devils
who
will
do
my
bidding
at
all
times
and
take
a
scalp
on
their
own
account
every
chance
they
get
said
persimmon
bill
then
he
took
an
eagle
feather
with
its
tip
dipped
in
crimson
from
the
coronet
of
the
chief
and
handed
it
in
the
presence
of
all
the
indians
to
jack
keep
thus
and
when
out
on
the
plains
wear
it
in
your
hat
where
it
can
be
seen
and
the
sioux
will
ever
pass
you
unharmed
and
you
can
safely
come
and
go
among
them
now
go
back
get
the
list
and
all
the
news
you
can
and
bring
it
here
as
soon
as
you
can
tell
addie
to
ride
out
with
you
when
you
come
next
jack
placed
the
feather
in
a
safe
place
inside
his
vest
bowed
his
head
and
wheeling
his
horse
turned
toward
the
town
before
he
had
ridden
a
hundred
yards
he
looked
back
persimmon
bill
had
vanished
not
an
indian
was
in
sight
and
no
one
unacquainted
with
their
vicinity
could
have
seen
a
sign
to
show
that
such
dangerous
beings
were
near
no
smoke
rose
above
the
trees
no
horses
were
feeding
around
nothing
to
break
the
apparent
solitude
of
the
scene
and
that
was
persimmon
bill
muttered
the
rider
as
he
galloped
back
so
handsome
it
does
not
seem
as
if
he
could
be
the
murderer
they
call
him
and
yet
if
all
is
true
he
has
slain
tens
where
wild
bill
has
killed
one
no
matter
he
will
be
useful
to
me
that
is
all
i
care
for
now
chapter
iii
a
warning
when
wild
bill
and
sam
chichester
entered
the
saloon
alluded
to
in
our
first
chapter
they
were
hailed
by
several
men
one
of
whom
wild
bill
warmly
responded
to
as
california
joe
while
he
grasped
the
hand
of
another
young
man
whom
he
called
captain
jack
come
crawford
said
he
addressing
the
last
named
let
wet
up
dry
as
an
empty
no
benzine
for
me
bill
replied
crawford
or
captain
jack
not
touched
a
drop
of
the
poison
in
six
months
what
quit
drinking
jack
is
the
world
coming
to
an
end
i
suppose
it
will
sometime
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
drinking
i
promised
old
cale
durg
to
quit
and
i
done
it
and
i
never
took
a
better
trail
in
my
life
i
fresh
as
a
daisy
strong
as
a
elk
and
happy
as
an
antelope
on
a
wide
range
all
right
jack
but
i
must
drink
come
boys
all
that
will
come
up
and
wet
down
at
my
expense
california
joe
and
most
of
the
others
joined
in
the
invitation
and
captain
jack
took
a
cigar
rather
than
lift
a
shingle
from
the
roof
as
he
said
where
are
you
bound
bill
asked
captain
jack
as
bill
placed
his
empty
glass
on
the
counter
and
turned
around
to
the
black
hills
with
your
crowd
that
is
if
i
live
to
get
there
live
you
have
any
thought
of
dying
have
you
i
never
saw
you
look
better
then
i
make
a
corpse
jack
for
i
tell
you
my
time
is
nearly
up
i
felt
it
in
my
bones
this
six
months
i
seen
ghosts
in
my
dreams
and
felt
as
if
they
were
around
me
when
i
was
awake
no
use
jack
when
a
chap
time
comes
he
has
got
to
go
nonsense
bill
do
think
of
anything
like
that
a
long
life
and
a
merry
one
that
my
motto
we
go
out
to
the
black
hills
dig
out
our
fortunes
and
then
get
out
of
the
wilderness
to
enjoy
life
boy
i
never
known
the
happiness
outside
of
the
wilderness
that
i
have
in
it
what
you
kill
there
is
what
was
made
for
killing
the
food
we
need
what
one
kills
among
civilization
is
only
too
apt
to
be
of
his
own
kind
and
bill
shuddered
as
if
he
thought
of
the
many
he
had
sent
into
untimely
graves
stuff
bill
you
half
crazed
by
your
dramatic
trip
you
acted
so
much
that
reality
comes
strange
let
go
out
to
camp
and
have
a
talk
about
what
is
ahead
of
us
not
till
i
buy
a
horse
jack
i
want
a
good
horse
under
me
once
more
i
ridden
on
cars
and
steamboats
till
my
legs
ache
for
a
change
there
a
sale
stable
close
by
let
go
and
see
what
stock
is
there
said
sam
chichester
agreed
cried
all
hands
and
soon
bill
and
his
friends
were
at
the
stable
looking
at
some
dozen
or
more
horses
which
were
for
sale
there
the
beauty
i
want
said
wild
bill
pointing
to
a
black
horse
full
sixteen
hands
high
and
evidently
a
thoroughbred
name
your
price
and
he
is
my
meat
that
horse
is
for
sale
now
he
was
spoken
for
an
hour
ago
or
maybe
less
by
a
cash
customer
of
mine
a
chap
from
texas
chap
from
texas
muttered
bill
cusses
from
texas
are
always
crossin
my
trail
that
chap
from
abilene
was
a
texas
with
hair
as
red
as
fire
where
is
your
cash
customer
mr
liveryman
gone
out
riding
somewhere
replied
the
when
he
comes
back
tell
him
wild
bill
wants
that
horse
and
i
reckon
he
let
wild
bill
buy
him
if
he
knows
when
he
is
well
off
i
give
two
cusses
and
an
amen
for
all
the
rest
of
the
horses
in
your
stable
i
want
i
tell
jack
said
the
stableman
but
i
do
think
it
will
make
much
odds
with
him
he
has
as
good
as
bought
the
horse
for
he
offered
me
the
money
on
my
price
but
i
could
change
his
five
treasury
note
it
take
more
than
a
name
to
scare
him
he
always
goes
fully
armed
you
tell
him
what
i
said
and
that
i
here
at
sunset
for
that
horse
said
bill
and
he
strode
away
followed
by
his
crowd
an
hour
later
the
man
from
texas
reined
in
his
own
horse
a
fiery
mustang
from
his
own
native
plains
in
front
of
the
stable
though
the
horse
was
all
afoam
with
sweat
showing
that
it
had
been
ridden
far
and
fast
it
did
not
pant
or
show
a
sign
of
weariness
it
was
of
a
stock
which
will
run
from
rise
of
sun
to
its
going
down
and
yet
plunge
forward
in
the
chill
of
the
coming
night
you
want
the
black
hawk
horse
you
spoke
for
this
morning
do
you
asked
the
stableman
as
jack
dismounted
of
course
i
do
i
got
the
change
there
is
his
price
three
hundred
dollars
you
said
yes
but
there
been
a
chap
here
looking
at
that
horse
who
told
me
to
tell
you
his
name
and
that
he
intended
to
take
that
horse
i
told
him
a
man
had
bought
it
but
he
said
him
wild
bill
wants
it
and
that
wild
bill
will
come
at
sunset
to
take
it
he
will
it
was
hissed
rather
than
spoken
while
the
young
texan
face
grew
white
as
snow
his
blue
eyes
darkening
till
they
seemed
almost
black
he
will
let
him
try
it
a
sudden
death
is
too
good
for
the
wretch
but
if
he
will
force
it
on
why
let
it
come
the
horse
is
bought
let
him
come
at
sunset
if
he
dares
and
the
young
man
handed
the
three
one
greenback
notes
chapter
iv
give
up
that
horse
or
die
leaving
the
the
young
texan
went
directly
to
the
german
restaurant
and
asked
for
willie
pond
he
was
shown
up
to
the
room
recently
engaged
by
the
traveler
and
found
him
engaged
in
cleaning
a
pair
of
fine
silver
mounted
remington
revolvers
getting
ready
i
see
said
the
texan
i
have
bought
you
a
horse
the
best
in
this
whole
section
i
gave
three
hundred
dollars
there
is
your
change
keep
the
two
hundred
to
buy
stores
with
for
our
trip
said
pond
no
need
of
it
i
laid
in
all
the
stores
we
need
you
can
buy
yourself
a
couple
of
blankets
and
an
for
wet
weather
a
couple
of
tin
cans
of
pepper
and
salt
is
all
that
i
lay
in
when
i
going
to
rough
it
on
the
plains
the
man
that
ca
kill
all
the
meat
he
needs
fit
to
go
there
maybe
you
right
the
less
we
are
burdened
the
better
for
our
horses
are
we
likely
to
meet
indians
on
the
route
none
that
will
hurt
or
you
when
you
in
my
company
the
sioux
know
me
and
will
do
me
no
harm
that
is
good
the
indians
were
my
only
dread
i
a
favor
to
ask
it
is
granted
before
you
ask
it
what
is
it
i
want
to
break
your
horse
to
the
saddle
before
you
try
it
you
are
not
so
used
to
the
saddle
i
reckon
as
i
am
i
will
take
a
ride
at
sunset
and
bring
him
around
here
for
you
to
look
at
that
is
right
i
am
only
thankful
to
have
you
ride
him
first
though
you
may
find
me
a
better
rider
than
you
think
perhaps
but
he
looks
wild
and
i
like
to
tame
uns
i
have
him
here
between
sundown
and
dark
all
right
i
told
you
i
see
to
getting
arms
i
had
these
revolvers
and
cartridges
for
them
but
i
want
a
light
repeating
rifle
get
me
a
good
one
with
as
much
ammunition
as
you
think
i
need
all
right
i
get
a
now
model
winchester
they
rattle
out
lead
faster
than
any
other
tool
i
ever
carried
the
texan
now
left
he
had
not
spoken
of
wild
bill
desire
to
possess
that
horse
because
he
had
an
idea
that
willie
pond
would
weaken
and
give
up
the
horse
rather
than
risk
bloodshed
for
its
possession
and
perhaps
he
had
another
idea
a
mysterious
one
which
we
do
not
care
to
expose
at
this
stage
of
the
story
this
young
texan
hastened
from
the
german
restaurant
to
a
small
neat
house
in
the
outskirts
of
the
town
knocking
in
a
very
peculiar
manner
he
was
admitted
at
once
by
a
tall
and
strikingly
beautiful
young
woman
whom
he
addressed
as
if
well
acquainted
with
her
i
here
addie
and
i
seen
you
found
him
all
right
when
you
told
him
who
sent
you
did
you
not
asked
the
lady
leading
the
way
to
a
in
the
rear
of
the
cottage
yes
ready
to
do
anything
for
one
you
recommend
poor
bill
a
braver
man
and
a
truer
friend
never
lived
he
loves
me
and
i
fear
it
will
be
his
ruin
for
he
will
too
often
come
within
the
reach
of
those
who
would
destroy
him
if
they
only
knew
where
and
how
to
reach
him
persecution
and
cruelty
placed
him
on
the
bloody
path
he
has
had
to
follow
and
now
now
he
is
an
outlaw
beyond
all
chance
for
mercy
should
he
ever
be
taken
he
never
will
be
taken
guarded
as
he
is
you
saw
his
guards
then
yes
forty
or
fifty
of
them
and
i
would
rather
have
them
as
friends
than
foes
he
wants
you
to
ride
out
with
me
to
meet
him
when
i
go
next
with
some
information
that
he
needs
when
will
that
be
asked
the
lady
in
the
early
morning
or
perhaps
if
nothing
happens
to
me
between
now
and
sunset
to
make
it
unnecessary
between
now
and
sunset
that
is
within
two
hours
do
you
anticipate
any
danger
not
much
i
have
a
little
task
before
me
i
have
a
horse
to
break
and
a
man
known
as
will
bill
to
tame
wild
bill
the
the
desperado
who
has
killed
at
least
one
man
for
every
year
of
his
life
yes
the
same
but
ask
me
no
more
questions
now
after
i
have
tamed
him
i
will
report
or
if
he
has
settled
me
there
will
be
no
need
of
it
do
not
run
this
risk
it
must
be
done
he
has
in
a
manner
defied
me
and
i
accept
his
defiance
surely
he
does
not
know
no
he
knows
nothing
of
what
you
would
say
if
i
did
not
interrupt
you
nor
do
i
intend
he
shall
at
present
it
is
enough
that
you
know
it
and
will
care
for
both
my
body
and
my
good
name
should
i
fail
you
know
i
will
but
you
must
not
fall
i
do
not
intend
to
i
think
i
can
crush
him
by
a
look
and
a
word
i
shall
try
at
least
if
all
goes
well
i
will
be
here
by
eight
to
arrange
for
our
visit
i
hope
you
will
come
and
safely
i
will
addie
until
the
cup
of
vengeance
is
full
heaven
will
surely
spare
me
but
i
must
go
i
have
no
time
to
spare
the
young
texan
glanced
at
the
chambers
of
a
handsome
which
he
carried
to
see
if
it
was
ready
for
use
replaced
it
in
his
belt
and
then
with
a
cheerful
smile
left
the
room
and
house
hastening
to
the
stable
he
selected
a
saddle
lengthened
the
stirrups
to
suit
himself
took
a
stout
bridle
from
among
a
lot
hanging
in
the
and
accompanied
by
the
approached
the
newly
purchased
black
hawk
horse
i
may
as
well
have
him
ready
he
said
for
if
wild
bill
is
to
be
here
at
sunset
that
time
is
close
at
hand
you
say
the
horse
has
not
been
ridden
no
said
the
my
regular
breaker
was
not
here
when
i
bought
him
black
joe
tried
to
mount
him
but
the
horse
scared
him
well
i
soon
see
what
he
is
made
of
if
i
can
get
saddle
and
bridle
on
him
said
the
texan
they
now
together
approached
the
large
box
stall
in
which
the
stallion
was
kept
the
horse
almost
perfect
in
symmetry
black
as
night
with
a
fierce
wild
look
turned
to
front
them
as
they
approached
the
barred
entrance
steady
boy
steady
cried
the
texan
as
he
sprang
lightly
over
the
bars
and
at
once
laid
his
hand
on
the
arched
neck
of
the
horse
to
the
wonder
of
the
stableman
the
horse
instead
of
rearing
back
or
plunging
at
the
intruder
turned
his
eyes
upon
him
and
with
a
kind
of
tremor
in
his
frame
seemed
to
wait
to
see
what
his
visitor
meant
so
steady
black
hawk
steady
old
boy
continued
the
texan
kindly
passing
his
hand
over
the
horse
neck
and
down
his
face
the
horse
uttered
a
low
neigh
and
seemed
by
his
looks
pleased
with
his
attentions
that
beats
me
cried
the
old
joe
had
to
lasso
him
and
draw
him
down
to
a
ringbolt
before
he
could
rub
him
off
hand
me
the
saddle
and
bridle
said
the
texan
still
continuing
to
pet
the
beautiful
and
spirited
animal
in
a
few
seconds
without
difficulty
the
same
kind
and
skillful
hands
had
the
horse
both
saddled
and
bridled
the
texan
now
led
the
horse
out
on
the
street
where
quite
a
crowd
seemed
to
be
gathering
perhaps
drawn
there
by
some
rumor
of
a
fight
in
embryo
and
as
he
glanced
up
the
street
the
texan
saw
wild
bill
himself
with
his
in
his
belt
come
striding
along
with
california
joe
and
a
dozen
more
at
his
heels
in
a
second
the
texan
vaulted
upon
the
back
of
the
horse
which
made
one
wild
leap
that
would
have
unseated
most
riders
and
then
reared
on
its
hind
legs
as
if
it
would
fall
back
and
crush
its
master
at
this
instant
wild
bill
rushing
forward
pistol
in
hand
shouted
give
up
that
horse
or
die
chapter
a
square
the
texan
paid
no
heed
to
the
words
of
the
desperado
but
bending
forward
on
the
horse
with
his
full
weight
drove
his
spurs
deeply
into
its
flanks
startled
and
stung
with
pain
the
noble
animal
at
one
wild
bound
leaped
far
beyond
where
bill
and
his
friends
stood
and
in
a
second
more
sped
in
terrific
leaps
along
the
street
the
cowardly
cuss
is
running
away
yelled
bill
derisively
it
is
false
he
is
coward
he
will
tame
the
horse
first
and
then
cried
a
voice
so
close
that
bill
turned
in
amazement
to
see
who
dare
thus
to
speak
to
him
the
terror
of
the
west
a
woman
he
muttered
fiercely
as
he
saw
a
tall
and
girl
standing
there
with
flashing
eyes
which
did
not
drop
at
his
gaze
a
woman
who
has
heard
of
wild
bill
and
neither
fears
nor
admires
him
she
said
undauntedly
is
the
fellow
that
rode
off
on
the
horse
your
husband
or
lover
that
you
take
his
part
asked
bill
half
angrily
and
half
wondering
at
the
temerity
of
the
lovely
girl
who
thus
braved
his
anger
he
is
neither
she
replied
scornfully
i
glad
of
it
i
shall
not
make
you
a
widow
or
deprive
you
of
a
future
husband
when
he
comes
under
my
fire
if
he
should
be
fool
enough
to
come
back
he
comes
now
see
for
yourself
he
has
tamed
the
horse
now
comes
your
turn
coward
and
braggart
bill
was
white
with
anger
but
she
was
a
woman
mind
no
matter
what
he
felt
too
well
he
knew
the
chivalry
of
the
far
west
to
raise
a
hand
or
even
speak
a
threatening
word
to
her
but
he
heard
men
around
him
murmur
her
name
it
was
addie
neidic
and
then
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
the
black
horse
and
rider
the
animal
completely
under
control
though
flecked
with
foam
came
down
the
street
slowly
and
gently
bearing
his
rider
with
an
air
of
pride
rather
than
submission
as
he
passed
the
german
restaurant
the
rider
raised
his
hat
in
salutation
to
willie
pond
who
stood
in
his
window
and
said
in
a
cheerful
voice
remain
in
your
room
i
have
news
for
you
and
will
be
there
soon
without
checking
his
horse
the
rider
kept
on
until
he
was
within
half
a
length
of
the
horse
of
wild
bill
then
checking
the
animal
he
said
in
a
mocking
tone
you
spoke
to
me
just
as
i
rode
away
i
come
back
to
hear
you
out
what
was
the
matter
with
wild
bill
he
stood
staring
wildly
at
the
texan
his
own
face
white
as
if
a
mortal
fear
had
come
upon
him
where
have
i
seen
that
face
before
he
gasped
can
the
dead
come
back
to
life
the
texan
bent
forward
till
his
own
face
almost
touched
that
of
wild
bill
and
hissed
out
one
word
in
a
shrill
whisper
sister
it
was
all
he
said
but
the
instant
wild
bill
heard
it
he
shrieked
out
is
him
him
i
shot
at
abilene
and
with
a
shuddering
groan
he
sank
senseless
to
the
pavement
in
an
instant
bill
friends
who
had
looked
in
wonder
at
this
strange
scene
sprang
to
his
aid
and
lifting
his
unconscious
form
carried
it
into
the
saloon
where
bill
had
met
californian
joe
captain
jack
and
the
rest
of
their
crowd
left
alone
the
young
texan
said
a
few
words
to
addie
neidic
then
dismounted
and
told
the
to
keep
that
horse
saddled
and
bridled
and
to
get
his
own
texan
mustang
ready
for
use
i
must
be
out
of
town
before
sunrise
or
wild
bill
and
his
friends
may
have
questions
to
ask
that
i
do
want
to
answer
just
now
he
said
and
then
he
walked
a
little
way
with
miss
neidic
talking
earnestly
but
soon
he
left
her
and
while
she
kept
on
in
the
direction
of
her
own
house
he
turned
and
went
to
the
german
restaurant
entering
the
room
of
willie
pond
he
said
abruptly
if
you
want
to
go
to
the
black
hills
with
me
on
your
own
horse
have
to
leave
this
section
mighty
sudden
wild
bill
has
set
his
mind
on
having
the
horse
i
bought
and
broke
for
you
and
he
has
a
rough
crowd
to
back
him
up
if
i
had
known
bill
wanted
the
horse
so
badly
i
could
have
got
along
with
another
said
pond
rather
quietly
what
let
have
the
horse
why
it
has
its
equal
on
the
plains
or
in
the
mountains
it
is
a
thoroughbred
a
regular
racer
which
a
sporting
man
was
taking
through
to
the
pacific
coast
on
speculation
he
played
faro
lost
got
broke
and
put
the
horse
up
for
a
tenth
of
its
value
i
got
him
for
almost
nothing
compared
to
his
worth
on
that
horse
you
can
keep
out
of
the
way
of
any
red
who
scours
the
plains
if
you
do
want
him
i
do
for
wild
bill
shall
never
put
a
leg
over
his
back
i
keep
him
do
get
mad
i
keep
him
and
go
whenever
you
are
ready
said
pond
completely
mastered
by
the
excitement
which
this
young
texan
exhibited
well
we
get
the
horses
out
of
town
and
in
a
safe
place
and
for
yourself
i
take
you
to
the
house
of
a
lady
friend
of
mine
to
stay
and
and
by
night
i
know
all
i
want
to
about
the
movements
of
the
other
party
and
we
can
move
so
as
to
be
just
before
or
behind
them
as
you
and
i
will
decide
best
all
right
jack
i
leave
it
to
you
are
you
sure
the
horse
will
be
safe
for
me
to
ride
yes
a
horse
like
that
once
broken
is
broken
for
life
they
never
forget
their
first
lesson
a
mongrel
breed
stupid
resentful
and
tricky
is
different
be
ready
to
mount
when
i
lead
him
around
i
will
send
for
your
and
you
will
find
it
at
the
house
where
we
stop
i
will
be
ready
said
pond
the
texan
now
left
and
pond
watched
him
as
he
hurried
off
to
the
stable
the
man
hates
wild
bill
with
a
deadly
hatred
he
murmured
i
must
learn
the
cause
perhaps
it
is
a
providence
that
i
have
fallen
in
with
him
and
i
have
concluded
to
keep
his
company
to
the
black
hills
but
i
must
call
the
landlord
and
close
up
my
account
before
the
other
comes
back
with
the
horses
the
german
was
so
put
out
by
the
sudden
giving
up
of
a
room
which
he
hoped
to
make
profitable
that
he
asked
an
extra
day
rent
and
to
his
surprise
got
it
chapter
vi
off
to
the
hills
it
was
some
time
before
wild
bill
became
fully
conscious
after
he
was
carried
into
the
saloon
and
when
he
did
come
to
he
raved
wildly
about
the
man
he
shot
in
abilene
and
insisted
it
was
his
ghost
and
not
a
real
man
he
had
seen
bill
friends
tried
to
cheer
and
reassure
him
and
got
several
stiff
draughts
of
liquor
down
his
throat
which
finally
set
him
up
as
they
said
till
he
began
to
look
natural
but
he
still
talked
wildly
and
strangely
i
told
you
joe
he
said
to
his
old
friend
i
told
you
my
time
was
nigh
up
this
has
been
my
first
warning
that
abilene
ghost
has
been
before
me
a
thousand
times
and
he
has
hissed
that
same
word
in
my
ear
bah
old
boy
what
the
use
of
your
talking
foolish
you
seen
no
ghost
that
chap
was
as
live
as
you
are
he
did
have
red
hair
and
blue
eyes
then
yes
but
there
are
lots
of
such
all
over
the
world
red
hair
and
blue
eyes
generally
travel
in
company
but
he
was
nothing
to
scare
you
you
could
have
wiped
him
out
with
one
blow
of
your
fist
let
alone
usin
shootin
irons
of
which
there
was
seein
he
did
draw
where
is
he
now
i
go
and
see
i
suppose
he
is
over
at
the
stable
joe
went
out
but
soon
returned
to
say
that
the
texan
had
just
ridden
off
after
paying
his
bill
the
did
not
know
where
let
him
go
murmured
bill
if
he
a
man
and
not
a
ghost
i
would
raise
a
hand
to
hurt
him
not
for
all
the
gold
in
the
black
hills
he
was
so
like
like
the
chap
i
dropped
in
abilene
bill
took
another
drink
but
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
could
lift
the
gloom
which
weighed
down
his
heart
only
once
did
his
face
brighten
that
was
when
sam
chichester
said
there
was
no
use
hanging
on
at
laramie
any
longer
for
a
bigger
crowd
they
were
strong
enough
now
and
would
start
for
the
hills
inside
of
hours
that
the
talk
for
me
cried
bill
i
want
to
get
out
of
here
as
soon
as
i
can
joe
and
pick
me
out
some
sort
of
a
horse
i
do
care
what

me
to
the
hills
i
ca
breathe
free
any
longer
where

a
lot
of
folks

you
a
horse
bill
said
joe
there
some
in
a
corral
just
out
of
town
as
tough
as
grizzlies
and
heavy
enough
for
your
weight
or
mine
i
do
weigh
down
as
i
did
said
bill
with
a
sigh
i
been
losin
weight
for
six
months
back
no
matter
it
be
less
trouble
to
tote
me
when
i
go
under
remember
boys
when
i
do
bury
me
with
my
boots
on
just
as
i
die
stop
your
clatter
about
dyin
bill
i
sick
o
that
kind
of
talk
it
time
enough
to
talk
of
death
when
its
clutch
is
on
you
i
ca
help
it
joe
old
pard
it
keeps
a
stickin
in
my
throat
and
if
it
did
come
out
i
choke
let
go
to
camp
said
chichester
can
you
walk
now
bill
yes
and
the
party
rose
took
a
parting
drink
with
the
landlord
and
started
for
camp
outside
bill
gave
a
startled
wild
glance
toward
the
spot
where
he
had
seen
the
texan
but
no
one
was
there
now
and
he
moved
on
with
his
companions
toward
their
camp
listening
to
but
not
joining
in
their
conversation
on
arriving
at
camp
chichester
as
captain
gave
orders
that
each
man
should
report
on
paper
or
verbally
so
it
could
be
taken
down
just
how
much
ammunition
he
had
the
number
and
kind
of
his
arms
private
stores
so
that
if
there
was
not
enough
to
make
the
trip
safely
more
could
be
provided
the
number
and
condition
of
horses
was
also
to
be
given
no
man
would
be
fitted
to
lead
such
a
party
did
he
not
consider
and
post
himself
fully
in
all
these
particulars
quite
a
crowd
of
townspeople
followed
the
party
out
for
the
news
soon
spread
that
they
intended
to
leave
in
a
short
time
so
around
their
blazing
there
were
many
visitors
toward
these
wild
bill
cast
many
a
stealthy
glance
but
he
did
not
see
the
texan
there
chapter
vii
the
outlaw
love
willie
pond
was
much
surprised
when
he
found
that
his
ride
only
extended
to
a
small
but
pretty
cottage
just
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
where
the
young
texan
introducing
him
to
miss
neidic
as
his
temporary
hostess
left
him
while
he
took
the
horses
to
a
safe
place
of
concealment
not
far
away
miss
neidic
look
her
new
visitor
into
the
rear
and
while
giving
him
a
cordial
welcome
and
passing
the
usual
salutations
scanned
him
with
a
keen
and
critical
eye
the
impression
left
must
have
been
rather
favorable
for
the
lady
seemed
to
feel
none
of
the
embarrassment
usual
when
strangers
held
a
first
interview
but
talked
on
as
easily
and
naturally
as
if
she
had
known
him
half
a
lifetime
how
long
have
you
been
in
town
mr
pond
was
one
of
her
many
questions
only
a
day
i
arrived
on
the
express
westward
bound
which
passed
this
morning
was
the
answer
why
that
was
the
same
train
the
desperado
wild
bill
came
on
yes
he
was
pointed
out
to
me
by
the
conductor
but
why
do
you
call
him
a
desperado
because
that
is
his
character
i
thought
none
but
outlaws
were
celled
desperadoes
there
is
where
the
mistake
comes
in
most
outlaws
are
desperadoes
but
a
man
be
a
desperado
and
yet
not
an
if
to
be
always
ready
to
shoot
for
a
look
or
a
word
whether
his
opponent
is
ready
or
not
is
not
being
a
desperado
i
do
not
know
what
is
but
excuse
me
he
may
be
a
friend
of
yours
oh
no
said
pond
with
some
confusion
in
his
manner
but
a
very
dear
friend
of
mine
married
him
not
long
since
and
for
her
sake
i
feel
a
sort
of
interest
in
the
man
i
fancied
that
he
was
rather
wild
when
under
the
influence
of
liquor
but
for
all
a
brave
and
generous
man
when
truly
himself
brave
as
brutes
are
when
he
feels
he
has
the
power
to
in
his
hands
but
said
miss
neidic
you
are
his
enemy
no
for
he
has
never
done
me
personally
an
injury
but
he
has
injured
friends
of
mine
sent
more
than
one
down
to
untimely
graves
there
i
said
it
you
are
his
enemy
because
of
what
he
has
done
to
your
friends
i
am
his
friend
nor
do
i
wish
to
be
the
friend
of
such
a
man
but
the
enmity
of
a
woman
is
nothing
to
him
he
looks
for
friends
among
such
men
as
he
now
consorts
with
california
joe
sam
chichester
and
that
crowd
i
know
but
one
real
gentleman
in
the
party
and
that
one
is
jack
crawford
i
know
none
of
them
you
lose
nothing
then
for
it
is
little
honor
one
gains
by
such
acquaintances
they
suit
wild
bill
for
they
drink
gamble
and
shoot
on
little
cause
they
are
ready
for
any
adventure
never
stopping
to
count
risks
or
look
back
when
evil
is
commenced
or
ruin
wrought
no
matter
what
may
be
its
nature
the
entrance
of
the
young
texans
now
caused
a
change
in
the
topic
of
conversation
i
have
learned
when
that
party
start
he
said
they
are
making
their
final
preparations
and
will
break
camp
in
this
morning
early
enough
to
make
creek
for
their
first
night
halt
probably
about
ten
do
you
propose
to
go
ahead
of
them
asked
pond
no
it
will
be
more
easy
and
safe
to
fellow
their
trail
they
will
not
have
over
fifty
animals
all
told
and
there
will
be
lots
of
feed
left
for
us
even
if
we
keep
close
by
and
we
can
get
as
much
game
as
we
need
any
time
for
we
can
use
but
little
one
pack
horse
will
carry
all
our
stuff
and
still
be
able
to
travel
at
speed
if
need
be
you
understand
it
better
than
i
said
pond
arrange
things
to
suit
yourself
and
i
will
conform
to
your
plans
all
right
you
had
better
turn
in
early
so
as
to
get
a
good
rest
for
after
we
are
out
long
rides
and
will
tell
on
you
for
you
are
not
used
to
them
i
will
show
you
to
a
chamber
your
valise
is
already
in
it
said
miss
neidic
pond
followed
her
and
the
texan
was
left
alone
to
his
thoughts
which
he
carelessly
expressed
aloud
so
far
all
works
well
he
said
willie
pond
is
as
soft
as
mush
but
i
read
him
through
and
through
he
would
go
with
me
if
he
did
think
he
have
a
chance
to
serve
wild
bill
for
though
he
shuns
bill
he
thinks
more
of
bill
than
he
would
have
me
think
i
bet
addie
has
found
that
out
found
out
what
said
the
lady
herself
who
had
returned
so
noiselessly
that
jack
had
not
heard
her
that
pond
as
he
calls
himself
is
a
friend
of
wild
bill
all
of
that
and
maybe
something
more
as
you
may
find
out
before
you
are
through
your
trip
what
do
you
mean
nothing
but
this
keep
your
eyes
open
and
study
your
pond
closely
there
is
nothing
dangerous
about
him
miss
neidic
laughed
heartily
nothing
very
dangerous
to
you
at
any
rate
she
said
but
if
they
all
go
in
the
morning
we
must
see
persimmon
bill
that
is
so
shall
i
bring
the
horses
round
no
we
might
be
overheard
i
will
go
to
the
stables
get
the
horses
ready
i
have
some
things
to
put
up
for
bill
and
i
will
come
as
soon
as
i
pack
them
in
a
pair
of
jack
now
left
for
the
stable
and
miss
neidic
with
a
forethought
began
to
gather
up
many
little
things
which
might
be
useful
to
her
outlaw
lover
who
had
little
chance
to
procure
articles
of
comfort
not
to
speak
of
luxury
except
when
on
some
raid
in
the
settlements
in
ten
minutes
she
was
ready
and
on
her
way
to
the
stables
jack
had
her
own
favorite
horse
saddled
while
for
himself
he
chose
the
black
hawk
beauty
in
a
few
seconds
both
were
mounted
and
in
the
darkness
they
sped
away
over
the
same
route
which
jack
had
taken
when
he
went
to
visit
persimmon
bill
little
was
said
as
they
rode
on
for
the
horses
were
kept
at
a
swift
gallop
and
before
the
hour
was
up
they
had
approached
the
ravine
as
near
as
they
deemed
safe
before
giving
the
signal
scarcely
was
it
given
before
it
was
answered
and
a
second
later
persimmon
bill
himself
was
by
the
side
of
addie
neidic
horse
and
she
was
pressed
to
the
outlaw
bosom
with
a
fervor
that
showed
he
had
a
heart
more
than
left
in
his
breast
it
kind
of
you
addie
to
come
out
here
in
the
chill
of
the
night
to
see
a
wild
cuss
like
me
outlawed
by
man
and
forsaken
by
heaven
it
safer
to
come
by
night
than
by
day
for
you
and
for
me
bill
she
said
and
i
could
bear
you
should
go
away
again
till
i
had
seen
you
and
i
brought
you
a
lot
of
things
i
know
you
need
i
shall
not
need
much
of
anything
addie
on
the
trail
i
soon
to
take
your
friend
here
i
know
is
safe
or
i
would
say
so
much
but
the
truth
is
the
reds
are
going
to
rise
in
a
body
all
over
the
north
and
northwest
and
we
sweep
the
black
hills
and
clean
out
every
that
is
sent
to
check
the
rising
the
sioux
have
made
me
a
big
chief
and
i
have
my
hands
full
if
you
hear
of
the
elk
as
second
only
to
sitting
bull
himself
you
know
who
it
is
you
of
course
yes
addie
that
is
the
name
they
have
given
me
and
if
the
sioux
fight
as
i
think
they
will
and
all
the
northern
tribes
join
we
force
a
treaty
that
will
give
us
all
the
black
hills
and
the
yellowstone
powder
river
and
big
horn
country
for
ourselves
forever
then
my
girl
and
not
till
then
can
i
make
a
safe
home
for
you
and
not
till
then
will
i
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
for
then
the
outlaw
will
be
safe
and
can
live
in
peace
and
look
for
days
of
home
and
happiness

when
you

peace
or

stranger

me

bill

to
the
texan

drawn
his
horse

little
so
as
not
to
intrude
on
the
conversation
between
the
lovers

have
the
news

most
of
them
with

miners
gamblers
and
a
couple
of
them
are
traders
they
have
fifty
animals
saddle
and
pack
and
carry
no
wagons
the
mules
are
loaded
pretty
heavy
at
least
them
that
belong
to
the
traders
and
are
well
worth
capture
all
right
and
there
is
one
of
the
party

want
hurt
until
he
is
in
your
hands

man
is
wild

him
if
i
can
help
it

you
bill
you
need
be
jealous
of
him
for
it

only
what
he
did
that
makes
me
ask
a
favor
for
him
i
know
it
addie
no
woman
on
earth
can
make
me
jealous
of
you

drilling

chance
so

meet
such
men
as
crook

and
carr
all
they
want
is
drill
and
discipline
to
make
them
the
best
soldiers
in
the
world
and
they
coming
into
it
finely
well
you
were
a
soldier

long
enough
to
know
all
that
should
be
done
a
soldier
too
long
girl
too
long
a
slave
to
men
who
held
authority
only
to
abuse
it
said
bill
in
a
bitter
tone
the
cruelty
exercised
on
me
then
turned
my
best
blood
to
gall
and
made
me
what
i
am
i
hate
the
name
and
my
blood
boils
beyond
all
restraint
when
my
eye
falls
upon
a
uniform
rightly
have
the
sioux
called
me
the
soldier
killer
for
never

let
one
who
wears

comes
within

reach

said
the
texan
wheeling
his
horse
to
take
the
back
trail
addie
neidic
as
if
from
some
uncontrollable
reason
turned
once
more
toward
her
lover
and
bending
from
her
saddle
threw
her
arms
about
his
tall
and
splendid
form
and
kissed
him
again
and
again
with
passionate
tenderness

careful
of
your
life

she
sobbed
as
she
turned
her
horse
and
followed
the
texan
at
a
gallop
chapter
viii
foiled
by
a
woman
it
was
their
last
night
in
town
before
breaking
up
camp
and
the
black
hillers
as
they
already
called
themselves
under
chichester
were
determined
to
have
a
lively
time
of
it
they
commenced
wetting
up
or
pouring
down
liquid
lightning
in
camp
but
being
reminded
that
what
they
used
there
would
be
missed
on
their
journey
they
started
to
skin
the
saloons
in
town
and
finish
out
their
spree
where
it
would
not
diminish
their
own
stores
as
wild
bill
said
they
were
going
where
money
would
be
of
little
account
if
all
the
stories
about
the
gold
to
be
found
were
true
so
what
they
spent
now
they
would
have
to
carry
and
they
went
in
as
such
reckless
men
generally
do
spending
their
money
as
freely
as
they
could
and
drinking
with
a
looseness
that
promised
headaches
on
the
morrow
if
nothing
more
wild
bill
went
in
on
the
spree
with
a
rush
as
if
he
wished
to
drown
the
remembrance
of
his
late
fright
and
despite
the
cautions
of
his
friend
captain
jack
who
strove
hard
to
keep
him
within
bounds
california
joe
of
course
was
in
his
element
and
in
a
little
while
all
the
party
became
so
turbulent
that
crawford
left
them
in
disgust
for
as
addie
neidic
had
said
of
him
despite
his
associations
he
was
a
gentleman
by
midnight
every
saloon
had
been
visited
and
many
of
them
pretty
well
cleaned
out
and
now
bill
proposed
to
go
and
break
a
faro
bank
that
some
of
the
party
spoke
of
i
have
seven
hundred
dollars
left
out
of
a
thousand
my
woman
gave
me
before
i
started
said
he
i
lose
that
or
break
the
bank
see
if
i
do
all
of
the
party
who
were
sober
enough
went
with
bill
and
soon
he
was
before
the
green
board
without
even
waiting
to
get
the
run
of
the
game
be
planked
a
hundred
dollars
on
the
king
and
lost
without
a
word
he
put
two
hundred
dollars
more
on
the
same
card
and
won
he
left
the
four
hundred
down
and
in
another
turn
he
had
eight
hundred
luck
is
with
me
boys
he
shouted
i
break
the
bank
let
her
swing
for
the
king
once
more
mr
dealer
to
the
wonder
of
all
though
it
was
the
last
turn
of
the
cards
the
king
won
and
wild
bill
picked
up
sixteen
hundred
dollars
his
friends
now
urged
him
to
quit
but
the
demon
of
the
game
had
entered
his
soul
and
he
swore
with
a
terrible
oath
that
he
would
play
till
he
broke
the
bank
or
was
broke
himself
a
new
pack
was
now
put
in
the
box
and
once
more
the
dealer
cried
out
make
your
bets
gentlemen
make
year
bets
the
game
is
ready
bill
with
a
reckless
bravado
as
much
of
rum
as
of
his
own
nature
again
laid
all
his
winnings
on
one
card
this
time
the
queen
and
with
wonderful
luck
it
could
be
nothing
else
he
again
doubled
his
pile
this
time
his
gains
being
hundred
dollars
stop
now
bill
cried
california
joe
this
ca
last
it
shall
last
the
bank
ca
stand
more
than
two
more
such
pulls
shouted
bill
wildly
and
again
on
the
same
card
he
staked
his
entire
winnings
the
dealer
and
banker
were
one
he
turned
pale
but
when
all
bets
were
down
he
pulled
his
cards
without
a
tremor
in
his
hand
but
a
groan
broke
from
his
lips
as
the
queen
once
more
came
out
on
the
winning
side
once
more
bill
stakes
were
doubled
and
this
time
he
changed
his
card
the
banker
hesitated
his
capital
would
hardly
cover
the
pile
if
bill
won
again
keep
on
whispered
a
voice
in
his
ear
if
he
breaks
you
i
stake
your
bank
the
banker
looked
up
and
saw
though
she
was
disguised
in
male
attire
a
face
he
well
knew
it
was
that
of
addie
neidic
and
he
knew
she
was
able
to
keep
her
word
wild
bill
had
heard
the
whisper
and
his
face
was
white
with
rage
for
he
thought
the
bank
would
succumb
before
it
would
risk
another
chance
with
his
wonderful
luck
but
he
let
his
money
lay
where
he
put
it
and
cried
out
to
the
banker
to
go
on
with
his
game
if
he
dared
the
latter
with
firm
set
lips
cried

had
won
coolly
as
if
money
was
no
more
than
waste
paper
bill
gathered
up
the
pile
and
began
to
thrust
it
away
in
his
pockets
when
the
disguised
woman
addie
neidic
thrust
a
roll
of
thousand
dollar
notes
into
the
hands
of
the
banker
and
cried
out
this
bank
is
good
for
fifty
thousand
dollars
let
no
braggart
go
away
and
say
he
has
bluffed
the

till
he
breaks

trembled
from
head
to
foot

he
hissed

who
bluffed

and
then
blow
the
top
of

the
scornful
reply
in
an
instant
bill
put
every
dollar
he
had
won
every
cent
he
had
in
the
world
and
a
gold
watch
on

of
that
on

not
another

around
the
table
made
a
bet
a
pin
could
have
been
heard
had
it
fallen
to
the
floor
so
complete
was
the
silence
the
banker
cried
out

ready
and
slowly
drew
the
cards

cried
a
second
after

all

for

he
shouted
and
his
hand
went
to
his
belt
but
even
as
his
hand
touched
his
pistol
he
heard
that
fearful
whisper
sister
and
saw
a
white
face
wreathed
in
auburn
hair
rise
over
addie
neidic
shoulder
and
with
a
groan
or
a
groaning
cry
of
terror
he
fell
back
insensible
to
the
floor
chapter
ix
the
ghost
again
appears
when
wild
bill
fell
the
banker
declared
his
game
closed
for
the
night
and
while
bill
friends
gathered
about
him
and
sought
to
bring
him
to
the
woman
addie
neidic
took
up
her
money
and
left
by
the
rear
entrance
and
the
banker
with
two
or
three
of
his
friends
escorted
her
home
fearing
bill
and
his
gang
might
annoy
her
if
the
latter
came
to
before
she
reached
her
residence
the
texan
did
not
go
with
her
but
with
a
slouched
hat
drawn
over
his
head
and
a
mexican
blanket
over
his
shoulders
stood
back
in
a
corner
unobserved
to
hear
bill
words
when
he
came
to
and
to
see
what
next
would
appear
on
the
desperado
programme
that
ghost
again
he
came
to
break
my
luck
these
were
the
last
words
that
wild
bill
spoke
when
recovering
his
consciousness
he
glared
out
upon
the
crowd
with
bloodshot
eyes
it
was
a
woman
who
broke
your
luck
addie
neidic
backed
the
bank
or
have
given
in
cried
another
who
is
addie
neidic
asked
bill
with
a
wondering
gaze
oh
i
remember
the
woman
who
called
me
a
coward
over
at
the
who
is
she
where
does
she
live
in
a
cottage
west
of
town
they
say
she
rich
let
go
and
clean
out
her
crib
cried
a
ruffian
who
did
not
belong
to
bill
party
but
most
likely
held
some
spite
against
miss
neidic
ay
that
the
word
let
clean
out
the
house
and
set
fire
to
it
cried
another
a
chum
of
the
first
speaker
it
required
but
a
leader
now
to
set
the
vile
work
going
and
wild
bill
gradually
recovering
his
reason
but
mad
with
drink
and
just
realizing
that
every
dollar
he
had
and
even
his
watch
was
gone
was
just
the
man
for
such
a
leader
i
go
show
me
the
house
and
we
teach
her
to
wear
her
own
clothes
and
let
men
games
alone
shouted
wild
bill
in
a
moment
fifty
men
were
ready
to
go
but
first
they
made
an
onslaught
on
the
wines
and
liquors
on
the
sideboard
of
the
while
they
were
madly
pouring
these
down
the
texan
slipped
from
the
room
and
ran
swiftly
to
the
cottage
of
his
fair
friend
addie
he
cried
as
she
opened
the
door
to
his
signal
wild
bill
and
a
crowd
of
full
fifty
men
are
coming
here
to
rob
you
and
burn
your
house
they
are
mad
with
drink
and
even
if
the
stranger
up
stairs
will
fight
we
three
can
hardly
hold
them
at
bay
no
matter
how
well
we
are
armed
we
will
not
try
it
said
addie
calmly
i
had
about
made
up
my
mind
to
go
with
persimmon
bill
he
loves
me
so
well
that
i
ought
to
be
able
and
willing
to
bear
hardship
for
his
sake
i
care
little
for
the
house
and
furniture
though
they
are
mine
and
cost
me
a
large
sum
i
have
money
and
jewelry
that
we
can
carry
off
i
will
rouse
my
two
servants
while
you
call
your
friend
and
we
will
all
be
out
of
the
house
before
they
come
no
one
but
you
knows
where
your
horses
are
kept
let
that
be
the
place
of
rendezvous
and
before
daylight
we
will
be
safe
with
my
lover
no
i
do
not
want
to
be
with
him
yet
addie
i
will
take
this
newly
found
friend
and
see
you
safely
in
reach
of
bill
but
we
will
make
camp
elsewhere
till
bill
party
starts
then
we
be
on
his
trail
and
you
on
ours
as
it
was
agreed
upon
as
you
like
jack
but
we
must
hurry
all
right
as
soon
as
i
bring
my
friend
down
do
you
go
with
him
and
your
servants
to
the
stable
carrying
off
what
you
can
leave
me
here
for
i
want
to
give
wild
bill
one
more
good
scare
as
you
please
but
be
careful
he
do
kill
you
while
you
scare
him
ah
i
hear
their
yells
we
must
be
quick
willie
pond
had
a
white
scared
face
when
he
came
from
his
chamber
for
while
the
texan
told
him
of
the
danger
the
yells
and
shouts
of
the
drunken
ruffians
who
were
approaching
could
be
plainly
heard
it
seemed
as
if
a
gang
of
demons
from
the
lower
regions
had
been
let
loose
on
earth
come
with
me
cried
addie
neidic
as
pond
came
down
with
his
valise
in
hand
be
quick
or
there
will
be
murder
under
this
roof
pond
seemingly
dazed
and
bewildered
obeyed
and
out
by
a
rear
door
hastened
the
fair
owner
of
the
doomed
house
with
her
maid
or
and
willie
pond
while
the
texan
telling
them
he
soon
would
follow
remained
plainly
now
the
shouts
and
vile
threats
of
the
drunken
marauders
came
to
the
ears
of
the
single
listener
i
wish
i
had
a
barrel
or
two
of
gunpowder
here
he
muttered
i
make
them
sing
another
tune
nearer
and
nearer
they
came
and
now
the
texan
extinguished
every
light
but
one
which
he
shaded
with
his
hat
then
he
looked
to
the
front
door
and
windows
and
saw
that
they
were
all
barred
except
a
single
shutter
which
he
left
so
he
could
open
it
a
minute
later
and
the
tramp
of
a
hundred
hurrying
feet
came
loudly
on
his
ear
then
shouts
clean
her
out
kill
her
and
burn
her
crib
in
a
minute
the
crowd
brought
up
before
the
closed
doors
open
your
doors
woman
or
we
shatter
them
cried
wild
bill
open
or
down
goes
everything
shouted
the
crowd
here
bill
here
is
a
shutter
loose
cried
one
wild
bill
sprang
toward
it
and
as
he
did
so
the
shutter
flew
open
he
saw
a
white
face
surrounded
by
auburn
hair
he
heard
one
gasping
cry
sister
and
he
fell
back
in
terror
crying
out
the
ghost
the
ghost
but
some
one
fired
a
shot
the
light
went
out
and
all
was
dark
where
the
light
had
been
bill
recovered
from
his
shock
almost
as
soon
as
he
felt
it
and
joined
with
the
shout
down
with
the
doors
down
with
the
doors
the
crash
that
followed
told
that
the
frail
obstacles
had
given
way
and
bill
cried
out
in
and
clean
the
crib
out
ghost
or
no
ghost
give
us
light
and
clean
the
crib
out
cheer
after
cheer
told
that
the
house
was
entered
and
a
minute
later
torches
made
from
splintered
doors
and
shutters
blazed
in
a
dozen
hands
as
the
ruffians
ran
to
and
for
in
search
of
plunder
the
ghost
find
the
ghost
or
the
woman
yelled
bill
chapter
x
a
mystery
the
excited
and
ruffianly
crowd
dashed
to
and
fro
overturning
the
furniture
tearing
aside
curtains
and
looking
for
plunder
but
unable
to
find
anything
of
value
beyond
the
furniture
or
to
see
a
single
living
person
under
the
roof
not
a
dollar
in
money
not
a
piece
of
plate
rewarded
their
search
fire
the
crib
fire
the
crib
came
from
fifty
throats
and
almost
as
soon
as
spoken
the
act
was
consummated
wild
bill
angered
to
find
no
one
on
whom
to
vent
his
wrath
or
shake
his
thirst
for
revenge
looked
on
the
blaze
as
it
rose
with
gloomy
satisfaction
muttering
that
he
only
wished
the
witch
of
a
woman
was
burning
in
it
the
crowd
increased
as
the
flames
rose
higher
and
tighter
but
no
one
tried
to
check
them
and
soon
it
was
but
a
smoldering
mass
of
ruins
where
the
pretty
cottage
had
stood
but
the
late
occupant
unharmed
was
a
mile
away
and
having
just
paid
off
and
discharged
her
faithful
servants
was
on
the
point
of
mounting
to
ride
off
with
the
texan
and
pond
when
the
last
shout
of
the
dispersing
crowd
reached
her
ears
she
smiled
when
she
heard
it
and
said
i
can
afford
all
the
harm
they
have
done
i
led
but
a
lonesome
life
there
i
feel
that
the
change
i
am
about
to
make
will
be
for
the
better
the
three
with
two
loaded
horses
besides
those
they
rode
now
moved
quietly
but
swiftly
out
of
the
suburbs
of
the
town
where
the
horses
had
been
stabled
and
with
the
texan
leading
the
way
steered
to
the
westward
having
no
compass
but
the
stars
for
an
hour
the
three
rode
on
and
then
pointing
to
some
timber
ahead
the
texan
said
addie
there
is
where
you
will
find
him
whom
you
seek
tell
him
i
have
not
altered
any
of
my
plans
and
that
i
shall
lay
in
camp
at
spring
an
hour
gallop
south
of
the
creek
the
next
morning
i
will
follow
the
trail
we
spoke
of
and
now
addie
and
do
forgot
me
you
know
i
will
not
i
hope
yet
to
see
you
happy
and
to
be
happier
than
i
am
now
we
shall
meet
again
perhaps
pond
but
for
now
and
while
the
texan
and
pond
remained
still
on
their
horses
she
rode
on
leading
one
toward
a
growth
of
trees
seen
dimly
ahead
the
texan
remained
where
he
was
until
he
heard
her
give
the
signal
and
receive
an
answer
and
then
turning
to
pond
he
said
she
is
safe
we
may
as
well
move
on
we
have
a
long
ride
to
where
i
intend
to
camp
all
right
said
the
other
this
night
work
seems
almost
like
a
dream
i
can
hardly
realize
that
wild
bill
would
lead
such
a
disgraceful
crowd
of
ruffians
and
do
such
a
dastardly
act
as
to
burn
a
woman
out
of
house
and
home
rum
takes
all
the
out
of
those
who
use
it
said
the
texan
i
use
it
myself
sometimes
i
know
but
it
is
when
i
feel
as
if
i
was
all
giving
out
and
could
go
through
what
was
before
me
and
i
feel
abashed
when
i
think
i
need
such
a
stimulant
to
fire
up
my
flagging
nature
pond
made
no
reply
but
rode
on
thoughtfully
at
the
rapid
pace
which
the
other
led
the
pack
animal
keeping
close
in
the
rear
at
last
he
asked
who
did
miss
neidic
expect
to
meet
where
we
left
her
a
brave
man
who
loves
her
dearly
but
who
has
been
driven
in
his
desperation
by
cruel
injustice
to
do
some
work
which
keeps
him
outside
of
towns
and
settlements
for
the
present
his
love
is
returned
by
her
and
henceforth
she
will
share
his
dangers
and
his
hardships
none
can
tell
but
those
who
test
it
how
deeply
how
entirely
and
how
lasting
a
true
woman
loves
said
pond
with
a
sigh
and
none
but
a
woman
wronged
can
tell
how
bitterly
she
can
hate
said
the
other
as
he
dashed
his
spurs
into
his
horse
and
galloped
on
miles
were
swiftly
passed
over
and
the
gray
of
dawn
was
just
beginning
to
soften
night
darkness
in
the
east
when
the
texan
exclaimed
here
we
are
now
for
a
rest
of
one
day
at
least
and
as
he
spoke
he
drew
up
his
horse
by
the
side
of
a
small
pool
of
water
which
trickled
out
from
under
the
roots
of
a
single
large
tree
for
an
acre
or
so
around
it
there
were
bushes
growing
as
high
as
the
horses
but
when
light
came
no
other
growth
but
that
of
short
buffalo
grass
and
prickly
cactus
could
be
seen
the
texan
unsaddled
his
horse
and
unloaded
the
pack
animal
before
pond
could
get
his
saddle
ungirthed
then
the
texan
sprang
to
his
assistance
finished
stripping
the
horse
and
with
a
long
lariat
picketed
it
out
in
the
best
grass
his
own
horses
he
turned
loose
saying
they
never
would
stray
from
camp
then
taking
his
rifle
he
stepped
out
from
camp
saying
he
was
going
after
meat
in
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
pond
heard
the
crack
of
his
rifle
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
young
man
was
back
with
the
fat
saddle
of
a
young
antelope
on
his
shoulder
here
is
meat
enough
for
and
he
said
next
day
we
will
be
on
buffalo
ground
and
we
have
some
hump
ribs
to
roast
gathering
a
few
dry
light
sticks
he
soon
had
a
hot
and
almost
smokeless
fire
ablaze
on
the
coals
of
this
he
set
his
broiled
some
meat
and
while
pond
looked
on
in
surprise
he
quickly
had
a
nice
breakfast
of
antelope
steak
coffee
and
a
few
hard
biscuit
which
were
in
the
pack
while
pond
took
hold
and
ate
heartily
praising
the
food
by
his
actions
much
as
his
words
the
texan
ate
lightly
yet
all
that
he
wanted
not
touching
the
bread
but
using
meat
entirely
there
be
the
more
left
for
you
said
he
when
pond
noticed
that
he
ate
no
bread
i
never
care
for
anything
but
meat
on
the
plains
it
gives
bone
and
muscle
and
that
is
what
we
need
here
the
more
simple
the
food
the
better
the
health
we
use
ourselves
to
salt
but
we
would
be
just
as
well
off
without
it
eat
hearty
and
take
a
good
nap
we
have
nothing
to
do
the
party
whose
trail
will
be
our
guide
to
the
hills
will
not
start
till
late
we
shall
not
move
until
morning
and
then
i
show
you
the
coals
of
the
which
light
there
will
be
no
need
for
any
shelter
but
this
tree
overhead
everything
looks
clean
and
dry
there
no
better
camping
ground
than
this
for
a
couple
on
the
plains
the
water
is
good
feed
plenty
and
we
do
require
much
fire
this
time
of
year
pond
tired
and
sleepy
was
only
too
glad
to
take
the
texan
advice
so
he
spread
his
blanket
lay
down
and
soon
was
in
the
land
of
dreams
meantime
the
texan
with
a
small
in
his
hand
mounted
the
tree
and
from
a
perch
on
its
uppermost
limbs
scanned
the
prairie
in
all
directions
but
most
often
in
the
direction
from
which
they
had
come
nothing
was
in
sight
but
wild
game
scattered
here
and
there
and
he
soon
came
down
and
prepared
to
take
a
rest
on
his
own
account
they
not
pass
till
afternoon
he
muttered
and
i
may
as
well
rest
a
few
hours
while
i
can
in
peace
and
safety
he
took
a
long
and
curious
look
at
the
form
of
his
sleeping
traveling
companion
and
a
strange
smile
flitted
over
his
face
as
he
muttered
a
mystery
but
i
can
solve
it
chapter
xi
in
the
wilds
if
ever
a
man
was
astonished
when
he
responded
to
that
after
midnight
signal
at
the
mouth
of
dead
man
hollow
it
was
the
outlaw
persimmon
bill
he
came
from
his
place
of
concealment
expecting
to
meet
the
texan
with
news
and
found
instead
addie
neidic
and
with
her
on
a
pack
horse
all
the
wealth
and
apparel
she
had
in
the
world
addie
love
what
does
this
mean
he
cried
as
she
sprang
from
the
horse
and
threw
herself
into
his
arms
it
means
this
bill
i
have
come
to
stay
with
you
go
where
you
go
live
as
you
live
and
die
where
you
die
addie
dearest
did
i
not
tell
you
to
wait
till
i
could
give
you
a
home
in
peace
and
quietness
yes
bill
but
there
were
those
that
would
not
let
me
wait
had
it
not
been
for
thy
texan
friend
most
likely
i
would
have
been
murdered
by
a
mob
of
drunken
ruffians
led
on
by
wild
bill
warned
in
time
i
escaped
with
all
that
i
had
worth
saving
except
my
house
and
furniture
those
they
burned
i
saw
the
blaze
from
my
stable
where
i
went
to
get
my
horses
to
come
to
you
by
all
that
fiendish
this
is
more
than
i
can
bear
i
ride
in
with
my
sioux
and
burn
the
cursed
town
no
bill
for
my
sake
keep
cool
and
hear
me
i
am
glad
it
is
done
i
was
wretched
and
lonely
there
how
lonely
no
words
may
tell
i
was
in
constant
anxiety
on
your
account
i
trembled
daily
hourly
lest
i
should
hear
of
your
death
or
capture
now
i
shall
be
with
you
know
of
your
safety
or
if
you
are
in
peril
share
the
danger
with
you
but
addie
you
can
never
endure
the
privations
and
the
fatigue
of
such
a
life
as
i
must
lead
at
present
soon
i
must
be
on
a
bloody
we
will
have
regular
troops
to
meet
great
battles
to
fight
and
it
will
be
my
glory
and
pride
to
be
with
you
in
all
your
perils
to
show
your
red
allies
what
a
woman
dares
and
can
do
for
him
whom
she
loves
dearest
i
see
not
how
it
can
be
helped
but
i
grieve
to
see
you
suffer
do
not
grieve
my
love
while
my
face
is
bright
with
smiles
do
not
let
your
heart
be
heavy
while
mine
is
full
of
joy
think
but
this
i
am
thine
until
death
we
will
never
part
while
life
thrills
our
veins
your
triumphs
shall
be
mine
i
will
glory
in
your
courage
and
in
your
enterprise
i
have
arms
and
well
know
their
use
no
warrior
in
all
your
following
can
ride
better
than
i
that
i
am
fearless
i
really
believe
for
twice
inside
of
ten
hours
have
i
defied
wild
bill
in
his
anger
and
laughed
when
his
hand
was
on
his
pistol
but
take
me
to
your
camp
i
am
tired
and
the
night
air
is
chilly
and
take
care
of
the
pack
horse
my
silver
and
over
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
money
is
on
his
back
and
what
clothing
i
shall
need
for
a
time
you
bring
a
rich
dowry
addie
but
your
love
is
worth
more
than
all
the
treasures
the
world
could
show
come
darling
i
will
take
you
as
the
most
precious
gift
a
wild
bad
man
ever
received
you
are
not
bad
bill
you
are
my
hero
and
my
love
bill
could
only
press
his
answer
on
her
lips
and
then
with
the
bridle
of
her
horses
in
his
hand
and
her
arm
linked
in
his
he
walked
back
up
the
winding
bed
of
the
ravine
for
near
a
quarter
of
a
mile
then
he
emerged
into
an
open
space
where
there
were
full
a
hundred
indian
ponies
staked
out
with
their
owners
lying
in
groups
about
near
small
smoldering
a
few
only
were
on
guard
and
these
on
seeing
their
white
chief
appear
paid
no
apparent
attention
to
the
companion
though
they
doubtless
saw
her
it
is
the
indian
nature
to
be
stoical
and
never
to
manifest
surprise
no
matter
what
occurs
inside
the
line
where
the
ponies
were
staked
was
a
small
brush
house
and
in
front
of
this
bill
halted
with
his
led
horses
with
his
own
hands
unsaddled
one
and
unpacked
the
other
leaving
packs
and
saddles
in
front
of
the
house
well
he
knew
they
were
as
safe
there
as
they
would
have
been
behind
bolts
and
bars
in
the
settlements
even
more
safe
come
in
my
love
he
said
the
sioux
will
care
for
the
horses
come
in
and
receive
the
best
a
fond
heart
can
give
in
the
way
of
shelter
and
comfort
it
is
all
i
ask
she
murmured
as
with
him
she
entered
the
home
chapter
xii
on
the
trail
it
was
high
noon
when
the
young
texan
woke
up
and
when
he
rose
pond
still
lay
sleeping
the
former
laughed
lightly
as
he
rose
and
bathed
his
face
in
the
limpid
water
for
the
beard
of
the
sleeper
had
got
all
awry
showing
that
it
was
false
no
need
for
a
disguise
here
said
the
texan
but
let
him
keep
it
up
when
the
time
comes
i
read
him
a
lesson
cutting
some
antelope
stakes
the
texan
built
up
a
smokeless
fire
and
had
them
nicely
broiled
when
willie
pond
woke
up
mercy
how
i
have
slept
he
said
as
he
looked
at
the
sun
already
fast
declining
toward
the
west
you
are
not
used
to
passing
sleepless
nights
said
the
texan
when
we
are
fairly
launched
into
the
indian
country
you
may
not
sleep
so
sound
take
hold
and
eat
a
hearty
eater
on
the
plains
generally
stands
travel
best
it
is
likely
we
have
a
ride
or
more
if
those
black
hillers
get
sobered
down
to
their
work
they
do
well
if
they
make
their
twenty
pond
went
and
bathed
his
face
and
hands
in
the
limpid
water
before
eating
and
as
he
expressed
it
rubbed
the
sleep
out
of
his
eyes
then
he
went
at
the
toothsome
steak
with
appetite
not
at
all
impaired
by
the
pure
open
air
he
was
breathing
the
meal
taken
with
comfort
and
deliberation
occupied
a
half
hour
or
more
and
as
there
were
no
dishes
to
wash
clearing
up
things
only
consisting
in
tossing
the
bones
out
of
the
way
wiping
their
knives
on
a
bunch
of
grass
scouring
them
with
a
plunge
or
two
in
the
dry
sand
they
were
all
ready
for
next
your
horse
hears
something
so
does
mine
said
the
texan
pointing
to
the
animals
which
suddenly
stopped
feeding
and
with
their
ears
pricked
forward
looked
off
to
the
i
can
see
nothing
what
can
alarm
them
said
pond
they
hear
the
tramp
of
the
black
hills
party
i
think
horses
have
far
better
hearing
than
we
have
and
will
feel
a
jar
of
the
ground
that
would
not
attract
our
attention
i
want
no
better
sentinel
than
my
mustang
and
your
black
hawk
seems
to
take
to
the
watch
by
instinct
i
will
go
up
on
my
post
and
see
if
anything
is
in
sight
slinging
the
strap
of
his
over
his
shoulder
the
texan
hurriedly
climbed
up
the
tree
seated
among
the
limbs
he
adjusted
his
glass
and
looked
away
to
the
northeast
there
they
are
he
cried
who
what
exclaimed
pond
rather
nervously
the
black
hillers
struggling
along
mighty
careless
their
route
covers
half
a
mile
in
length
when
in
good
marching
order
it
should
not
cover
a
hundred
yards
with
scouts
in
the
rear
front
and
on
both
flanks
at
twice
the
distance
that
is
the
way
we
travel
in
texas
wild
bill
has
been
a
scout
so
long
i
should
think
he
would
know
all
about
it
said
pond
a
heap
them
scouts
know
who
travel
with
uncle
sam
troop
said
the
texan
in
a
tone
of
contempt
let
them
ride
with
a
gang
of
texan
rangers
a
few
months
and
they
learn
something
your
troops
ca
move
or
stop
to
water
without
sounding
their
bugles
to
tell
the
indians
where
they
are
in
the
morning
all
day
and
at
night
it
is
toot
toot
with
their
infernal
horns
and
the
reds
know
just
where
to
find
one
of
our
texan
ranger
bands
will
travel
a
hundred
miles
and
you
not
hear
noise
enough
to
wake
a
coyote
from
them
all
these
black
hillers
travel
slow
they
from
their
spree
i
reckon
they
deserve
to
be
drunkenness
always
punishes
the
drunkard
i
have
no
pity
for
them
can
you
see
any
sign
of
them
from
where
you
stand
asked
the
texan
pond
looked
carefully
off
in
the
direction
the
other
pointed
and
replied
no
they
do
not
even
raise
dust
then
we
are
safe
here
from
observation
they
go
too
slow
to
make
dust
and
they
moving
over
grass
any
way
it
will
be
dark
before
they
reach
their
but
to
make
the
next
which
is
full
fifty
miles
away
they
have
to
start
earlier
ah
what
does
that
mean
what
startles
you
nothing
me
but
a
couple
of
men
from
that
party
have
dashed
out
from
the
line
at
a
gallop
and
they
ride
this
way
heaven
i
hope
bill
wild
bill
is
not
one
of
them
cried
pond
greatly
excited
are
you
sure
they
are
coming
here
riding
does
not
assume
that
they
coming
said
the
texan
coolly
they
may
have
flanked
off
to
look
for
some
fresh
meat
yes
that
is
it
he
added
they
bear
up
to
the
north
now
they
want
to
go
ahead
of
the
party
so
as
to
kill
something
fresh
for
supper
captain
jack
kept
sober
when
all
the
rest
were
drinking
last
night
and
wager
he
is
one
of
the
hunters
and
most
likely
sam
chichester
is
the
other
we
safe
from
observation
pond
so
do
get
nervous
we
not
see
wild
bill
pond
smiled
but
there
was
a
tremor
about
him
that
showed
he
was
easy
to
take
alarm
and
hard
to
get
over
it
the
texan
came
down
from
the
tree
and
busied
himself
in
gathering
some
dry
fuel
small
sticks
which
would
make
a
quick
hot
blaze
and
little
or
no
smoke
then
he
cut
off
some
long
thin
flakes
of
antelope
flesh
from
the
saddle
hanging
on
the
tree
and
half
cooked
half
dried
it
meat
may
be
a
little
unhandy
to
get
in
the
rear
of
that
straggling
band
he
said
if
we
have
a
little
on
hand
it
will
do
no
hurt
you
are
thoughtful
said
pond
i
would
make
a
poor
manager
i
fear
on
the
plains
i
should
forget
everything
until
it
was
needed
you
are
not
too
old
to
learn
said
the
texan
laughing
excuse
my
asking
the
question
but
have
you
long
been
acquainted
with
that
strange
and
beautiful
woman
addie
neidic
not
very
long
myself
but
i
had
a
brother
who
knew
her
very
well
and
loved
her
almost
to
madness
she
was
his
true
friend
but
she
did
not
love
him
is
he
living
now
living
if
ever
you
meet
wild
bill
but
no
it
is
my
secret
ask
me
no
more
about
him
every
word
just
spoken
flew
from
the
texan
lips
like
sheets
of
fire
his
eyes
flashed
and
his
face
flushed
while
his
form
trembled
from
head
to
foot
forgive
me
i
did
not
mean
to
wound
your
feelings
said
pond
moved
by
the
excitement
of
the
other
no
matter
i
know
you
did
no
matter
it
will
all
come
right
one
of
these
days
i
wish
my
heart
was
stone
pond
was
silent
for
he
saw
the
texan
eyes
fill
with
tears
and
he
seemed
to
know
that
nothing
which
he
could
say
could
soften
a
grief
so
deeply
felt
the
texan
was
the
first
to
speak
addie
neidic
is
a
strange
but
a
noble
girl
he
said
her
father
was
a
rough
sporting
man
but
her
mother
was
a
lady
born
and
bred
the
mother
lived
long
enough
to
educate
addie
in
her
own
ways
but
she
died
just
as
addie
was
budding
into
beauty
addie
met
her
lover
when
he
was
a
soldier
at
fort
russell
near
cheyenne
after
he
was
driven
to
desertion
by
cruelty
and
injustice
she
met
him
from
time
to
time
and
when
her
father
died
leaving
her
all
his
fortune
she
moved
up
to
laramie
i
think
i
know
now
the
reason
why
she
could
meet
him
more
often
you
said
that
he
was
an
outlaw
yes
when
he
deserted
he
killed
the
two
sentinels
who
were
on
guard
over
him
then
killed
a
mounted
officer
and
rode
away
on
his
horse
he
was
hunted
for
by
whole
companies
as
fast
as
they
could
be
mounted
but
he
could
not
be
taken
but
after
that
if
a
soldier
or
an
officer
rode
alone
a
mile
or
more
from
the
post
he
seldom
returned
but
his
body
told
that
persimmon
bill
the
killer
as
he
was
called
still
lived
around
wild
bill
has
done
bloody
work
cruel
work
in
his
time
but
persimmon
bill
has
killed
ten
men
to
his
one
it
is
strange
that
an
intelligent
woman
like
addie
neidic
should
love
such
a
man
no
he
is
both
a
martyr
and
a
hero
in
her
eyes
a
more
stately
form
a
nobler
face
never
met
favor
in
the
eyes
of
woman
to
his
foes
fierce
and
relentless
to
her
he
is
gentle
and
kind
she
will
never
meet
aught
but
tenderness
at
his
hands
i
wish
i
could
have
seen
him
you
may
yet
see
him
pond
he
travels
the
plains
as
free
as
the
antelopes
which
bound
from
ridge
to
ridge
adopted
by
the
sioux
nation
known
to
them
as
the
elk
he
has
become
a
great
chief
and
their
young
braves
follow
in
his
lead
with
a
confidence
which
makes
them
better
than
the
solders
sent
to
subdue
them
chapter
xiii
the
black
hillers
en
route
the
young
texan
had
judged
rightly
when
he
conjectured
that
it
was
sam
chichester
and
captain
jack
that
had
ridden
out
from
the
straggling
column
of
the
black
hillers
as
he
saw
from
his
eyrie
in
the
tree
they
had
two
objects
in
doing
so
the
ostensible
object
was
to
reach
the
first
with
some
game
for
supper
but
another
was
to
converse
unheard
by
the
others
on
the
probable
dangers
of
the
trip
and
means
to
meet
and
overcome
such
dangers
there
is
no
doubt
the
sioux
are
on
the
said
chichester
to
captain
jack
as
they
rode
on
side
by
side
none
in
the
world
they
taken
a
hundred
scalps
or
more
already
on
the
black
hills
route
the
troops
have
been
ordered
to
move
up
the
missouri
and
yellowstone
and
that
will
make
them
worse
than
ever
be
lucky
if
we
get
through
without
a
brush
that
was
a
mean
thing
the
burning
out
of
that
neidic
girl
last
night
was
it
yes
crawford
and
if
persimmon
bill
ever
comes
across
wild
bill
goose
is
cooked
mark
that
there
is
not
a
surer
shot
or
a
deadlier
foe
on
earth
then
persimmon
bill
he
has
defied
the
whole
border
for
the
past
three
years
ridden
right
into
a
military
post
and
shot
men
down
and
got
away
without
a
scratch
they
say
he
has
been
adopted
by
the
sioux
and
if
he
has
with
such
backing
he
do
more
mischief
than
ever
i
do
believe
bill
would
have
injured
the
woman
had
he
been
sober
it
was
a
mean
thing
to
do
any
way
and
i
sorry
any
of
our
party
had
a
hand
in
it
so
am
i
but
look
jack
you
can
see
ahead
that
is
the
timber
on
creek
there
we
camp
we
spread
a
little
here
and
the
one
who
sees
a
fat
elk
first
will
drop
him
we
keep
within
sight
and
hearing
of
each
other
and
if
one
fires
the
other
will
close
on
him
all
right
sam
and
the
brave
young
scout
all
the
better
for
being
ever
temperate
and
steady
gently
diverged
to
the
right
while
chichester
bore
off
to
the
left
game
in
the
shape
of
prairie
hens
rose
right
and
left
as
they
rode
on
and
every
little
while
a
band
of
antelopes
taking
the
alarm
would
be
seen
bounding
over
the
sandy
ridges
while
an
elk
farther
off
startled
by
the
antelope
would
take
fright
and
trot
off
in
style
the
two
hunters
were
now
nearing
the
timber
and
they
rode
more
slowly
and
with
greater
caution
suddenly
as
chichester
rose
over
a
small
ridge
he
came
upon
a
band
of
a
dozen
or
more
noble
elk
which
trotted
swiftly
off
to
the
right
where
captain
jack
seeing
them
coming
had
sprung
from
his
horse
and
crouched
low
on
the
ridge
chichester
saw
his
movement
and
lowered
the
rifle
which
he
had
raised
for
a
flying
shot
for
he
knew
by
their
course
the
elk
would
go
so
close
to
crawford
that
he
could
take
his
pick
among
them
and
make
a
sure
shot
the
result
justified
his
movement
for
the
noble
animals
seeing
only
a
riderless
horse
scented
no
danger
and
kept
on
until
they
were
within
easy
of
the
experienced
hunter
crack
went
his
rifle
and
the
largest
fattest
elk
of
the
band
gave
one
mighty
bound
and
fell
while
the
rest
bounded
away
in
another
course
fully
alarmed
at
the
report
of
a
gun
so
close
and
its
effects
so
deadly
to
the
leader
of
the
band
you
got
as
nice
a
bit
of
meat
here
as
ever
was
cut
up
cried
chichester
to
captain
jack
as
he
came
in
at
a
gallop
while
crawford
was
cutting
the
throat
of
the
huge
elk
the
boys
will
have
enough
to
choke
on
when
we
get
to
camp
i
reckon
they
not
growl
over
this
said
jack
laughing
i
never
had
an
easier
shot
they
came
down
from
your
wind
and
never
saw
me
till
i
raised
with
a
bead
on
this
one
heart
the
two
hunters
had
their
meat
all
cut
up
and
in
condition
for
packing
to
camp
when
the
column
came
up
one
hour
later
just
as
the
sun
began
to
dip
beyond
the
trees
on
the
creek
side
the
party
went
into
camp
and
soon
over
huge
and
carelessly
built
slices
of
elk
steak
and
elk
ribs
were
roasting
and
steaming
in
a
most
appetizing
way
the
party
were
hungry
and
the
hungriest
among
them
were
those
who
had
drank
the
hardest
the
night
before
for
till
now
they
had
not
been
able
to
eat
but
the
day
travel
had
worked
some
of
the
poison
rum
out
of
them
and
their
empty
stomachs
craved
something
good
and
substantial
and
they
had
it
in
the
fresh
juicy
elk
meat
it
was
a
hard
and
unruly
crowd
to
manage
on
the
start
chichester
found
it
difficult
to
get
men
to
act
as
sentinels
for
they
mostly
declared
that
there
was
no
danger
of
indians
and
no
need
to
set
guards
little
did
they
dream
that
even
then
within
three
hours
ride
or
even
less
there
were
enough
sioux
to
meet
them
in
fair
fight
and
defeat
them
too
only
by
standing
a
watch
himself
and
putting
crawford
on
for
the
most
dangerous
hour
that
of
approaching
dawn
did
captain
chichester
manage
to
have
his
first
night
camp
properly
guarded
wild
bill
gloomy
and
morose
said
he
did
care
a
cuss
if
all
the
indians
of
the
sioux
nation
pitched
upon
them
he
knew
his
time
was
close
at
hand
and
what
did
it
matter
to
him
whether
a
red
wore
his
scalp
at
his
belt
or
some
white
man
gloried
in
having
wiped
him
out
but
the
night
passed
without
disturbance
and
a
very
early
start
was
made
next
morning
chichester
made
the
men
all
fill
their
canteens
with
water
and
the
animals
were
all
led
into
the
stream
to
drink
their
fill
for
there
was
a
long
dry
march
to
the
next
chichester
and
captain
jack
both
knew
the
route
well
for
they
had
both
been
over
it
in
one
of
the
first
prospecting
parties
to
the
hills
chapter
xiv
pond
seized
with
terror
nothing
of
note
occurred
in
the
little
camp
at
the
spring
that
first
night
just
before
sunset
the
young
texan
and
willie
pond
took
a
gallop
of
four
or
five
miles
to
exercise
their
horses
and
use
themselves
to
the
saddle
and
when
they
came
back
with
freshened
appetites
ate
heartily
and
afterward
slept
soundly
the
next
morning
both
woke
with
the
sun
and
after
a
hearty
meal
the
was
loaded
the
other
animals
saddled
and
the
route
taken
for
the
hills
a
ride
of
six
or
seven
miles
brought
them
into
the
trail
of
the
larger
party
and
at
noon
or
a
little
before
the
texan
halted
on
the
occupied
by
that
party
the
night
before
the
embers
of
their
fires
were
yet
alive
and
over
them
the
texan
cooked
dinner
for
himself
and
companion
pointing
to
the
bones
and
scraps
of
meat
thrown
around
the
texan
laughed
and
said
they
plenty
now
but
before
they
get
through
they
be
more
careful
for
if
the
indians
are
thick
game
will
be
hard
to
get
and
thinking
they
find
indians
before
they
three
days
out
you
said
the
sioux
would
be
friendly
to
you
yes
i
have
a
talisman
did
you
not
see
me
put
this
eagle
feather
tipped
with
crimson
in
my
hat
last
night
before
i
rode
out
yes
is
that
your
talisman
it
is
it
is
from
the
coronet
of
a
sioux
chief
and
was
given
to
me
as
a
safeguard
i
wish
i
had
one
keep
with
me
and
you
will
not
need
it
do
not
fear
that
i
will
go
far
from
you
alone
i
should
feel
utterly
lost
on
these
prairies
where
will
we
camp
very
close
to
the
party
that
is
ahead
of
us
they
will
go
to
a
creek
and
a
piece
of
timber
that
is
fully
fifty
miles
from
here
about
a
mile
from
where
i
think
they
will
camp
there
is
a
small
ravine
in
which
we
will
find
what
grass
and
water
we
need
it
will
be
near
nightfall
when
we
get
there
if
we
do
our
best
in
travel
but
if
we
ride
hard
take
the
longer
rest
i
do
not
care
to
keep
too
close
to
them
as
a
general
thing
but
we
ca
help
it
their
nooning
was
short
and
taking
the
precaution
to
water
their
horses
well
and
fill
their
canteens
they
rode
forward
over
the
trail
quite
swiftly
toward
night
they
could
see
the
trail
freshened
but
nothing
was
in
sight
except
a
distant
mark
when
night
fell
which
the
texan
said
was
the
timber
where
the
party
ahead
would
camp
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
smoke
was
seen
to
rise
in
that
direction
and
the
texan
spoke
contemptuously
of
the
carelessness
which
would
thus
expose
a
to
those
who
were
miles
distant
if
a
captain
of
a
ranger
band
would
do
such
a
thing
in
texas
he
said
his
men
would
reduce
him
to
the
ranks
and
put
one
in
his
place
who
knew
how
to
be
cautious
it
surely
is
imprudent
but
they
are
a
large
party
to
cook
for
and
must
have
large
fires
said
pond
the
young
texan
laughed
scornfully
let
every
man
make
his
own
fire
make
such
fires
as
you
have
seen
me
make
and
the
smoke
could
not
be
seen
a
away
was
the
answer
that
party
will
never
reach
the
hills
mark
that
if
indians
are
within
twenty
miles
they
see
a
smoke
like
that
but
what
is
it
to
us
we
safe
i
am
not
so
selfish
as
to
wish
harm
to
reach
them
even
if
we
are
safe
said
pond
testily
that
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
i
am
selfish
well
i
acknowledge
it
i
go
in
for
number
one
if
they
ca
take
ordinary
care
of
themselves
let
them
suffer
willie
pond
made
no
answer
but
rode
on
in
silence
night
was
now
upon
them
and
all
was
still
except
the
thud
of
the
galloping
hoofs
upon
the
plain
suddenly
a
gleam
of
fire
was
seen
far
ahead
the
texan
noted
it
and
swerved
off
to
the
left
there
is
the
camp
he
said
i
can
easily
find
our
now
i
was
afraid
we
would
not
see
their
fires
until
we
were
right
up
to
the
timber
but
they
are
careless
with
their
fire
as
they
are
with
their
smoke
we
shall
have
moonlight
in
an
hour
and
in
less
time
we
be
in
camp
he
rode
on
now
more
slowly
for
the
horses
were
tired
and
he
seemed
to
know
so
well
where
to
go
that
there
was
no
haste
the
moon
was
just
above
the
trees
when
the
texan
led
the
way
into
a
narrow
ravine
with
heavy
timber
on
either
side
up
this
full
ten
minutes
they
rode
and
then
an
exclamation
of
pleased
wonder
broke
from
the
lips
of
willie
pond
for
they
came
out
into
an
open
circular
plain
or
area
of
several
acres
in
extent
covered
with
rich
grass
and
centered
by
a
bright
lake
what
a
lovely
spot
cried
pond
who
on
earth
would
dream
of
finding
such
a
paradise
inside
of
gates
so
dark
and
rude
one
who
had
been
here
before
said
the
texan
but
speak
low
for
careless
as
they
may
be
over
there
in
camp
some
one
might
be
outside
listening
why
it
is
over
a
mile
away
is
it
not
yes
along
the
line
of
the
wood
but
over
this
cliff
were
it
crossed
it
is
not
a
quarter
of
that
distance
and
the
texan
pointed
to
a
rugged
cliff
on
their
right
i
will
be
careful
said
pond
my
enthusiasm
breaks
out
when
i
see
beautiful
things
i
can
hardly
restrain
myself
we
will
unsaddle
and
camp
our
horses
are
tired
and
need
food
and
drink
was
all
that
the
texan
said
and
he
at
once
unloaded
the
and
unsaddled
his
mustang
pond
becoming
more
handy
now
did
the
same
for
black
hawk
who
seemed
to
take
quite
a
fancy
to
his
new
master
curving
his
back
proudly
under
his
caressing
touch
shall
i
picket
him
as
we
did
at
the
last
camp
asked
pond
when
he
had
unsaddled
his
horse
no
let
him
go
with
mine
they
have
been
together
long
enough
to
mate
and
they
feed
peaceably
in
company
mine
will
never
stray
or
stampede
and
the
other
will
not
go
off
alone
the
simple
camp
was
soon
fixed
and
as
they
had
cooked
meat
left
and
biscuit
with
plenty
of
water
to
drink
both
agreed
that
there
was
no
necessity
to
build
any
fire
the
smell
of
smoke
might
reach
some
scout
over
there
said
the
texan
for
the
wind
blows
that
way
we
eat
and
then
turn
in
for
rest
will
come
good
to
both
of
us
the
horses
plunged
off
to
the
water
and
drank
and
then
went
to
cropping
the
luxuriant
grass
while
their
masters
ate
their
suppers
with
appetites
strengthened
by
their
long
and
wearying
ride
after
they
had
supped
willie
pond
would
as
usual
have
enjoyed
his
dainty
cigarette
had
not
the
texan
warned
him
that
tobacco
smoke
would
scent
farther
than
any
other
and
might
be
more
dangerous
in
betraying
their
presence
than
anything
else
so
pond
had
to
forego
his
smoke
he
took
a
blanket
and
moving
up
to
a
little
mossy
knoll
just
under
the
edge
of
the
cliff
threw
himself
down
to
sleep
the
texan
also
took
his
blanket
but
he
lay
down
near
the
saddles
and
packs
pond
was
so
very
weary
that
he
soon
fell
asleep
how
long
he
slept
he
did
not
know
but
a
strange
oppressive
dream
woke
him
and
with
the
moonlight
shining
full
in
the
valley
while
he
lay
shaded
beneath
a
tree
and
the
overhanging
cliff
he
saw
a
sight
which
froze
his
very
heart
with
a
mortal
terror
the
ravine
by
which
he
and
his
companion
had
entered
was
filled
with
mounted
indians
who
were
riding
silently
into
the
little
valley
chapter
xv
cheated
of
their
prey
literally
dumb
with
terror
so
weak
that
he
could
not
rise
pond
saw
this
strange
cavalcade
moving
up
toward
the
little
lake
and
looked
to
the
spot
where
the
texan
had
lain
down
to
see
if
he
had
yet
taken
the
alarm
to
his
wonder
and
redoubled
alarm
he
saw
the
texan
not
alone
but
with
a
white
man
dressed
in
buckskin
by
his
side
and
a
woman
also
apparently
in
friendly
converse
calmly
waiting
the
indian
advance
recognizing
at
a
glance
the
woman
as
addie
neidic
pond
realized
that
the
man
must
be
no
other
than
persimmon
bill
and
that
his
followers
were
the
sioux
whom
he
headed
heaven
help
me
there
is
some
fearful
treachery
here
wild
bill
and
his
companions
are
lost
if
they
are
not
warned
in
time
how
can
it
be
done
how
strangely
as
if
by
intuition
strategy
and
cunning
thought
come
to
some
when
environed
by
danger
without
a
moment
hesitation
pond
so
arranged
his
blanket
that
if
glanced
at
it
would
appear
he
was
yet
sleeping
under
it
for
he
left
his
hat
on
the
stone
where
his
head
had
been
and
his
rifle
leaning
against
the
tree
right
over
it
then
with
no
weapons
but
his
pistols
and
knife
in
his
belt
he
crept
off
up
the
with
the
silence
and
stealth
of
a
scout
who
had
been
a
in
the
business
he
wondered
at
himself
as
he
began
to
scale
the
not
daring
to
look
back
how
he
could
creep
up
amid
those
fearful
crags
so
noiselessly
and
how
he
could
have
got
away
unseen
when
the
texan
and
those
who
were
with
him
were
not
a
pistol
shot
away
on
on
he
kept
ever
seeking
the
shadowed
spots
where
no
moonlight
could
reveal
his
form
until
at
last
he
was
on
the
very
crest
of
the
hill
looking
down
he
plainly
saw
the
of
the
black
hillers
below
they
were
most
likely
buried
in
slumber
and
if
they
had
sentinels
out
his
life
would
be
endangered
by
a
rapid
approach
but
of
this
he
seemed
not
to
think
as
he
hurried
almost
recklessly
down
through
thickets
over
crags
and
along
rugged
gulches
how
he
got
down
he
hardly
knew
but
he
was
down
and
rushing
toward
the
nearest
fire
when
he
heard
a
stern
short
summons
close
in
his
front
halt
who
comes
there
a
man
armed
with
rifle
and
pistols
stepped
from
the
shadow
of
a
tree
and
pond
gasped
out
a
friend
a
friend
come
to
save
all
your
lives
there
are
a
hundred
indians
within
a
mile
of
you
led
by
the
desperado
persimmon
bill
who
are
you
was
the
stern
inquiry
wild
bill
will
know
me
take
me
to
him
quick
was
the
response
to
our
captain
first
come
along
said
the
sentinel
the
next
moment
willie
pond
was
in
the
presence
of
sam
chichester
and
captain
jack
telling
his
story
it
looks
like
truth
and
if
it
is
the
quicker
we
get
out
of
here
the
better
if
we
can
get
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
the
start
we
may
keep
it
said
chichester
he
says
wild
bill
knows
him
where
is
bill
cried
jack
ah
there
he
comes
bill
awakened
by
hearing
his
name
called
was
rising
and
now
approached
the
party
pond
sprang
forward
and
addressed
him
hurriedly
in
whispered
tones
wild
bill
for
an
instant
seemed
lost
in
astonishment
his
first
exclamation
being
great
heaven
you
here
but
after
he
heard
the
whispered
words
he
only
added
addressing
chichester
captain
this
friend
of
mine
will
not
lie
we
are
in
danger
and
he
has
risked
his
life
to
save
us
i
want
a
spare
horse
for
him
and
the
sooner
we
get
from
here
the
better
for
our
hair
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
the
whole
party
were
aroused
and
the
danger
explained
quickly
the
animals
were
saddled
and
in
less
than
twenty
minutes
the
was
all
deserted
though
more
fuel
had
been
purposely
heaped
on
the
fires
to
keep
up
the
appearance
of
occupation
if
scouts
should
be
sent
to
examine
the
camp
it
lacks
four
hours
yet
to
daylight
said
chichester
to
captain
jack
we
get
just
that
much
start
for
they
make
no
attack
until
just
as
day
begins
to
break
i
know
the
ways
of
them
red
cusses
only
too
well
you
have
much
the
advantage
of
me
in
that
kind
of
knowledge
sam
but
if
that
fellow
was
anywhere
right
as
to
their
numbers
and
the
sioux
are
well
mounted
they
bother
us
yet
before
we
get
to
the
hills
no
matter
if
we
do
get
eighteen
or
twenty
miles
the
start
we
give
a
long
race
and
a
tough
tussle
before
they
get
our
hair
any
way
said
chichester
i
wonder
who
that
fellow
is
bill
seems
to
like
him
right
well
for
they
ride
as
close
as
their
horses
can
move
together
bill
has
supplied
him
with
a
hat
he
came
in
you
know
yes
he
must
have
had
a
terrible
climb
to
get
over
to
us
the
only
wonder
is
he
got
away
undiscovered
he
said
he
left
his
blanket
in
a
shape
to
make
them
think
he
was
sleeping
under
it
he
must
be
an
old
hand
to
fool
them
so
nicely
he
does
look
like
it
he
does
ride
like
a
scout
or
a
plainsman
he
sits
his
horse
too
gracefully
no
matter
one
thing
is
certain
wild
bill
knows
him
well
trusts
him
and
they
stick
as
close
together
as
twins
yes
captain
jack
i
wish
you
take
the
rear
and
make
those
packers
keep
up
there
must
be
no
lagging
if
a
horse
or
mule
fails
they
must
be
left
i
keep
the
advance
going
thus
the
black
hillers
swept
on
at
a
gallop
knowing
that
a
merciless
fate
was
theirs
if
overtaken
by
the
sioux
chapter
xvi
the
pursuit
the
young
texan
had
not
dreamed
of
being
followed
so
soon
by
persimmon
bill
and
his
indians
and
he
had
lain
down
to
sleep
as
honestly
and
confidently
as
willie
pond
when
he
dropped
down
by
the
saddles
and
pack
he
was
aroused
by
a
touch
on
his
shoulder
when
he
awoke
and
was
surprised
to
find
bill
and
addie
neidic
standing
by
his
side
where
are
your
indians
was
the
first
question
the
texan
asked
as
bill
whispered
in
a
low
tone
i
am
here
i
have
followed
the
trail
a
little
sooner
than
i
thought
i
would
the
indians
are
in
the
ravine
waiting
for
my
signal
to
come
in
and
let
their
horses
feed
and
rest
before
we
attack
where
is
your
friend
continued
bill
sound
asleep
under
that
tree
up
there
he
sleeps
like
a
log
and
will
not
wake
till
i
shake
him
up
i
never
saw
such
a
sleeper
yesterday
he
spent
most
of
the
day
snoring
it
is
well
there
is
no
use
of
alarming
him
before
we
are
ready
for
work
i
will
give
the
signal
and
let
my
warriors
file
in
the
outlaw
waved
a
blanket
in
the
air
and
the
indians
silently
filed
into
the
valley
at
another
signal
they
turned
their
horses
loose
to
graze
and
then
gathered
in
groups
out
on
the
plain
to
take
food
and
rest
themselves
while
their
leader
conversed
with
the
texan
whom
having
seen
before
they
knew
as
his
friend
meantime
the
texan
motioning
addie
neidic
and
her
lover
to
take
seats
on
his
blanket
conversed
with
the
latter
in
a
low
tone
on
the
plan
of
attack
i
shall
not
make
it
until
just
as
day
dawns
for
two
reasons
said
the
outlaw
first
then
they
will
keep
the
most
careless
guard
second
when
light
is
coming
we
can
see
how
to
kill
and
how
to
save
the
two
whose
lives
are
to
be
spared
we
will
do
the
work
in
a
hurry
when
it
is
done
i
have
given
my
warriors
their
orders
most
of
them
know
wild
bill
and
captain
jack
for
both
have
been
on
the
reservations
often
when
they
have
been
in
for
these
reds
can
go
where
i
can
not
and
get
arms
and
ammunition
where
i
would
not
dare
apply
for
them
shall
i
not
make
you
and
addie
some
coffee
asked
the
texan
i
can
do
it
without
danger
for
i
have
a
small
alcohol
lamp
in
my
pack
which
i
had
to
keep
for
use
when
i
could
not
get
fuel
it
will
be
refreshing
indeed
if
there
is
no
risk
in
making
it
said
addie
neidic
there
is
none
and
i
will
soon
have
it
made
was
the
reply
shaded
from
even
indian
observation
by
the
blanket
he
raised
on
some
bushes
the
young
texan
speedily
made
a
quart
cupful
of
strong
coffee
and
shared
it
between
the
lady
and
her
outlaw
lover
it
and
some
cooked
meat
he
had
gave
them
strength
and
then
all
three
lay
down
like
the
others
to
rest
for
an
hour
or
two
the
outlaw
bidding
one
of
his
warriors
keep
watch
and
to
wake
him
when
the
morning
star
was
seen
over
the
trees
in
the
east
and
little
dreaming
that
their
intended
victims
were
far
away
from
their
camp
the
indians
and
their
leader
took
rest
preparation
to
their
deadly
work
when
his
warrior
sentinel
awoke
him
persimmon
bill
found
that
the
morning
star
was
well
up
and
it
was
full
time
to
be
moving
toward
the
scene
of
action
you
will
stay
here
in
the
valley
dear
addie
till
we
come
back
he
said
we
will
steal
away
quietly
and
not
wake
that
sleeping
stranger
if
it
can
be
helped
for
he
might
in
his
terror
fire
his
gun
or
in
some
way
give
an
alarm
should
he
wake
hearing
firing
over
there
keep
him
quiet
with
persuasion
or
your
revolver
until
we
return
and
then
if
he
is
obstreperous
i
will
quiet
him
let
me
go
with
you
bill
she
said
i
am
not
afraid
it
must
not
be
dear
addie
there
is
no
need
of
your
being
exposed
and
it
is
well
to
have
watched
here
our
main
certainty
of
complete
success
is
in
a
surprise
the
least
alarm
may
prevent
it
i
will
remain
then
she
said
and
you
need
not
fear
for
any
alarm
from
him
for
i
know
i
can
keep
him
quiet
should
he
wake
i
have
a
keen
persuader
here
if
i
have
to
use
it
and
she
touched
a
poniard
in
her
belt
which
also
contained
two
good
revolvers
an
outlaw
bride
she
added
smiling
must
be
prepared
to
take
care
of
herself
the
indians
now
began
silently
to
form
their
march
as
they
saw
their
white
leader
mount
and
the
young
texan
also
get
his
horse
the
black
hawk
seemed
uneasy
that
his
master
was
not
at
hand
and
the
texan
was
obliged
to
tie
him
by
the
side
of
the
horse
ridden
by
addie
neidic
before
he
would
be
quiet
it
is
strange
that
pond
does
not
wake
with
all
this
noise
said
the
texan
as
he
rode
off
with
persimmon
bill
but
as
i
told
you
he
is
the
soundest
sleeper
i
ever
traveled
with
the
indians
now
filed
away
out
of
the
valley
as
silently
as
they
entered
it
for
knowing
the
close
vicinity
of
the
other
camp
they
were
aware
how
necessary
it
was
to
be
cautious
and
now
addie
neidic
stood
alone
while
the
morning
star
rose
higher
and
higher
gazing
at
what
she
supposed
was
the
sleeping
man
on
the
knoll
the
moon
had
got
so
far
around
that
she
could
see
his
hat
the
rifle
against
the
tree
and
the
outlines
of
his
form
as
she
believed
i
will
move
up
and
secure
his
rifle
she
thought
after
the
band
had
been
gone
some
time
he
might
wake
and
in
his
first
alarm
use
it
foolishly
so
she
moved
with
a
noiseless
step
within
reach
of
the
gun
and
the
next
moment
it
was
in
her
possession
then
she
looked
down
to
see
if
he
showed
signs
of
waking
to
her
surprise
she
saw
no
motions
of
a
breathing
form
under
the
blanket
a
closer
look
told
her
that
if
a
form
had
been
beneath
the
blanket
or
a
head
under
that
hat
it
was
gone
and
feeling
with
her
hand
under
the
blanket
she
found
it
cold
no
warm
living
form
had
been
there
for
hours
he
has
been
alarmed
seen
us
and
crept
away
perhaps
is
hiding
in
terror
in
the
brush
she
muttered
she
did
not
even
then
realize
that
he
might
have
fled
away
to
alarm
the
other
camp
she
did
not
even
understand
several
shrill
yells
which
reached
her
ear
from
over
the
hill
she
had
not
been
with
the
sioux
long
enough
to
know
their
cries
these
yells
were
the
signal
cries
of
scouts
sent
in
who
had
found
a
deserted
camp
she
only
wondered
after
hearing
the
yells
that
she
did
not
hear
firing
the
sounds
of
battle
raging
while
she
yet
wondered
day
dawned
finding
her
standing
there
by
the
empty
blanket
of
willie
pond
holding
his
rifle
and
looking
up
the
hill
to
see
if
he
would
not
creep
out
now
that
light
had
come
and
the
indians
had
gone
a
shrill
neigh
from
the
black
horse
called
her
attention
toward
the
animal
and
she
saw
the
texan
riding
into
the
valley
on
a
keen
run
where
is
bill
she
asked
as
she
ran
to
meet
the
rider
with
blanket
hat
and
rifle
in
her
hand
gone
at
full
speed
with
his
warriors
on
the
trail
of
the
black
hillers
who
have
been
alarmed
in
some
way
and
have
got
at
least
two
hours
start
he
sent
me
back
to
bring
you
and
pond
along
here
is
all
of
pond
that
can
be
found
said
addie
holding
up
what
she
had
found
i
went
to
the
nest
the
bird
had
flown
and
the
nest
was
cold
the
texan
rode
quickly
to
the
spot
and
in
a
moment
saw
the
trail
over
the
ridge
made
by
pond
when
he
had
escaped
it
was
he
who
gave
the
alarm
him
whom
i
believed
so
sleepy
he
muttered
he
must
have
seen
bill
and
the
indians
when
they
first
came
arranged
his
blanket
and
hat
as
you
found
it
and
crept
over
the
hill
when
i
cautioned
him
to
keep
quiet
i
told
him
how
near
and
in
what
direction
they
were
i
see
it
all
green
as
i
took
him
to
be
he
has
outwitted
us
all
it
is
so
this
is
his
horse
a
noble
animal
too
we
will
take
that
with
us
of
course
and
we
must
hurry
on
for
bill
is
miles
on
the
trail
already
he
will
be
even
more
surprised
than
we
when
he
knows
how
the
black
hillers
got
warning
i
not
give
much
for
pond
hair
said
the
texan
in
a
few
seconds
the
horse
which
addie
had
ridden
was
saddled
and
ready
and
leaving
his
behind
but
leading
the
black
hawk
the
young
texan
with
addie
neidic
by
his
side
dashed
at
full
speed
over
the
valley
and
out
of
the
ravine
once
out
on
the
open
plain
they
could
see
far
away
to
the
west
a
cloud
of
dust
it
was
made
by
the
sioux
under
the
white
elk
who
were
pushing
the
horses
to
their
wildest
speed
on
the
trail
of
the
fugitives
this
trail
the
texan
and
addie
neidic
followed
at
their
utmost
speed
the
double
trail
made
by
the
black
hillers
and
the
pursuing
indians
would
have
been
plain
indeed
to
follow
had
not
the
column
of
dust
served
as
a
guide
with
their
horses
at
full
speed
and
better
than
the
general
run
of
indian
ponies
the
texan
and
his
fair
companion
gained
slowly
but
surely
on
the
indians
and
within
an
hour
had
passed
the
rear
of
their
column
and
were
pressing
well
to
the
front
yet
it
was
noon
when
they
ranged
alongside
of
persimmon
bill
himself
and
reported
the
discovery
addie
neidic
had
made
one
more
scalp
ahead
of
us
was
all
he
said
when
he
heard
the
report
and
he
pressed
on
still
faster
chapter
xvii
aid
with
their
lengthy
as
their
start
was
the
party
under
chichester
saw
their
pursuers
plainly
in
their
rear
before
the
day
was
passed
and
captain
jack
hurrying
up
the
rear
all
he
could
sent
word
to
chichester
that
the
reds
were
gaining
rapidly
chichester
sent
word
back
to
press
the
rear
forward
at
its
utmost
speed
he
could
see
timber
ahead
and
if
they
could
only
reach
it
they
might
be
able
to
make
a
stand
satisfied
from
the
report
of
willie
pond
that
over
one
hundred
and
indians
were
on
his
trail
fearful
that
many
of
his
men
would
flinch
in
battle
he
dared
not
with
the
few
that
were
true
make
a
stand
on
the
open
plain
had
all
been
like
wild
bill
california
joe
and
captain
jack
he
would
have
halted
rested
his
horses
and
given
the
reds
battle
rather
than
fly
from
even
treble
his
number
but
he
knew
well
that
a
few
cowards
would
weaken
the
rest
and
he
wanted
to
get
some
shelter
before
he
met
such
odds
the
timber
was
yet
fully
two
hours
ride
distant
half
of
the
had
given
out
and
been
left
and
many
of
the
mounted
men
complained
that
they
could
not
keep
their
horses
much
longer
in
the
column
sam
chichester
had
been
obliged
to
slacken
the
pace
in
front
and
the
enemy
were
gaining
so
fast
that
the
glitter
of
their
arms
could
be
seen
even
and
the
that
rose
above
them
suddenly
another
column
of
dust
was
seen
and
this
appeared
to
come
from
the
direction
of
the
timber
though
south
of
the
route
the
black
hillers
were
taking
men
muttered
sam
chichester
there
no
use
in
our
running
much
farther
if
that
new
cloud
of
dust
is
made
by
indian
all
that
we
can
do
is
to
sell
our
lives
as
dearly
as
we
can
we
will
soon
know
one
thing
or
the
other
they
not
on
the
line
we
taking
they
ca
be
coming
for
us
said
captain
jack
who
had
ridden
to
the
front
they
coming
in
our
flank
and
night
is
coming
too
growled
california
joe
if
we
can
keep
on
for
two
hours
more
we
have
darkness
to
shield
us
for
no
red
will
fight
in
the
dark
without
he
attacks
and
has
to
light
up
with
we
keep
them
on
while
an
animal
will
move
and
when
we
must
turn
and
fight
for
life
or
vengeance
if
we
must
go
under
said
chichester
forward
men
forward
once
more
again
captain
jack
took
the
post
of
honor
for
such
indeed
was
the
rear
guard
in
this
case
suddenly
on
looking
back
he
saw
that
the
indians
instead
of
gaining
had
come
to
a
halt
they
given
it
up
they
given
it
up
he
cried
sending
a
messenger
forward
to
captain
chichester
to
slacken
the
speed
of
the
column
it
was
now
almost
sundown
and
the
men
in
the
column
choked
and
thirsty
weary
beyond
expression
could
hardly
believe
the
news
was
true
they
were
soon
satisfied
though
that
it
was
but
it
was
not
for
an
hour
yet
when
twilight
was
beginning
to
gather
that
they
learned
the
real
cause
of
their
present
safety
the
indians
would
have
been
upon
them
before
night
set
in
had
they
not
first
discovered
the
nature
of
the
dust
cloud
to
the
or
rather
who
it
was
raised
by
the
of
the
texan
even
miles
and
miles
away
had
detected
the
flutter
of
cavalry
guidons
amid
the
dust
and
showed
that
mounted
troops
were
near
enough
to
come
to
the
aid
of
the
black
hill
men
before
they
could
be
crushed
and
their
scalps
taken
so
much
against
his
will
persimmon
bill
was
obliged
to
slacken
his
pace
and
soon
to
turn
his
course
so
as
by
a
night
march
to
put
his
warriors
beyond
the
reach
of
those
who
might
turn
on
them
when
night
fell
chichester
joined
by
two
companies
of
cavalry
bound
for
the
hills
under
orders
to
join
forces
already
on
the
way
by
another
route
moved
slowly
to
a
in
the
timber
for
which
he
had
been
heading
hours
back
the
horses
of
the
troops
were
weak
from
scant
forage
and
the
commanding
officer
did
not
feel
it
his
duty
to
wear
them
out
chasing
indians
though
he
held
himself
ready
to
protect
the
mining
party
as
long
as
they
remained
with
him
and
they
were
just
too
willing
to
go
on
with
such
an
escort
even
with
the
loss
of
all
the
pack
animals
left
on
their
trail
and
had
persimmon
bill
only
halted
instead
of
falling
back
he
would
have
found
that
there
was
no
danger
of
pursuit
chichester
and
crawford
when
they
compared
notes
and
found
not
a
man
of
their
party
lost
though
half
its
property
was
gone
felt
satisfied
that
it
was
no
worse
for
at
one
time
it
seemed
to
both
that
nothing
was
left
to
them
but
to
sell
their
lives
as
dearly
as
they
could
in
a
camp
all
were
settled
before
the
moon
rose
and
never
was
rest
more
needed
by
animals
and
men
chapter
xviii
on
the
bivouacked
on
the
treeless
plain
so
far
from
the
old
trail
and
from
the
timber
ahead
that
they
could
see
no
sign
of
the
black
hillers
or
the
troops
the
next
morning
sun
rose
on
the
band
of
sioux
led
by
persimmon
bill
used
to
all
kinds
of
exigencies
the
red
men
did
not
mind
either
a
lack
of
food
or
of
water
for
so
short
a
time
they
were
only
angered
with
the
thought
that
those
whom
they
had
deemed
an
easy
prey
had
escaped
them
as
soon
as
it
was
light
persimmon
bill
had
the
captured
examined
and
it
was
found
that
several
of
them
were
laden
with
provisions
others
had
ammunition
and
stores
and
on
some
of
them
were
found
kegs
of
liquor
these
the
wary
leader
at
once
destroyed
telling
his
followers
that
there
was
no
foe
so
deadly
to
the
red
man
as
this
and
not
one
drop
should
pass
his
lips
or
theirs
the
provisions
were
at
once
distributed
among
them
as
also
the
stores
but
the
liquor
was
given
to
the
thirsty
sands
where
at
least
it
could
do
no
harm
then
a
council
was
held
by
the
leader
with
the
chiefs
and
head
warriors
of
the
band
and
it
was
decided
that
it
would
be
foolish
to
pursue
the
black
hill
people
farther
now
that
troops
were
with
them
unless
a
large
band
of
sioux
could
be
found
for
it
is
not
indian
policy
to
risk
battle
against
odds
or
where
there
is
danger
of
great
loss
and
little
gain
to
reach
water
and
good
was
their
first
necessity
after
that
they
could
consider
where
next
to
go
sitting
bull
was
rallying
all
the
tribes
for
war
and
the
white
elk
had
promised
to
join
him
gloomily
the
young
texan
heard
all
this
talk
and
at
its
close
when
a
decision
had
been
arrived
at
he
said
here
we
must
part
i
follow
the
trail
of
wild
bill
if
i
follow
it
alone
i
had
hoped
to
see
him
die
a
slow
and
cruel
death
where
i
could
have
heard
him
plead
and
plead
in
vain
for
mercy
but
that
hope
is
gone
if
he
reaches
the
hills
in
safety
but
he
can
not
live
he
shall
not
i
have
sworn
to
kill
him
and
i
will
the
spirit
of
him
who
fell
at
abilene
cries
up
from
a
bloody
grave
for
vengeance
and
the
cry
shall
be
answered
you
have
been
kind
to
me
addie
neidic
and
so
has
he
to
whom
your
heart
is
given
i
shall
never
forget
it
but
our
courses
now
lie
apart
i
follow
yonder
trail
while
you
go
i
know
not
where
we
may
not
meet
again
if
we
do
i
shall
tell
you
wild
bill
is
dead
stay
with
us
i
will
yet
help
you
to
your
vengeance
said
persimmon
bill
no
it
will
be
too
long
delayed
i
am
hot
on
the
now
and
i
will
not
leave
it
fear
not
for
me
i
shall
hover
near
them
till
they
reach
the
hills
and
then
i
will
not
wait
long
to
fulfill
my
work
when
the
deed
is
done
if
i
still
think
life
is
precious
and
his
friends
press
me
too
hard
i
may
look
for
safety
as
you
have
done
with
the
sioux
come
and
you
shall
find
in
me
a
sister
and
in
him

brother

i
had
one
once
came
in
a
low
sobbing
cry
from
the
young
texan
lips
then
with
his
head
bowed
and
scalding
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks
he
drove
the
spurs
into
his
horse
and
sped
away
swiftly
in
the
direction
of
the
old
trail
the
black
hawk
horse
saddled
and
bridled
but
riderless
galloped
on
by
the
side
of
the
texan

with
no

to
part
from
his
company
he
had
death
in
his
eye
he
will
kill

and
we
shall
never
see
him
again
said

the
miners
are
rough
and
condemn
before
they
try
and
hang
as
soon
as
condemnation
is
spoken

said
something
seems
to
whisper
to
me
that
his
fate
is
in
some
way
linked
with
ours
i
too
feel
sure
that
he
will
kill
wild

and
then
escape
to
join

you

these

obeying
every
word

and
think
on
these
vast
plains
and
in
the
endless
range
of
hills

there
must
be
countless
thousands
who
want

a
daring
skillful
leader
to
make
them
the
best

troops
in
the
world
you
are

for

dearest
said
bill
with
a

smile
i
hope
to

chapter

save
oh
save
my
husband
safe
and
in
port
at
last
as
old
cale
durg
used
to
say
when
a
scout
was
over
and
he
was
back
in
garrison
this
was
the
joyous
exclamation
of
captain
jack
crawford
as
he
turned
to
sam
chichester
when
their
party
rode
into
the
settlement
at
the
deadwood
mines
in
the
black
hills
escorted
nearly
all
the
way
by
the
cavalry
they
had
so
providentially
met
they
had
been
troubled
no
more
by
the
indians
and
excepting
the
loss
of
some
horses
and
part
of
their
and
stores
had
suffered
nothing
not
a
man
had
been
hurt
and
best
of
all
they
came
in
sober
for
the
benzine
had
all
gone
with
the
lost
packs
for
it
was
heaviest
on
the
mules
as
it
would
have
been
on
the
men
had
it
not
been
host
i
glad
the
trip
is
over
my
temper
never
has
been
more
tried
said
chichester
the
most
of
the
men
have
had
their
own
way
though
when
we
started
they
promised
on
honor
to
obey
me
as
captain
but
honor
is
a
scarce
article
with
the
majority
of
them
now
they
here
they
go
it
with
a
looseness
you
bet
was
crawford
sententious
remark
wild
bill
will
be
in
his
element
look
at
the
signs
rum
faro
monte
all
have
a
swing
here
you
can
swear
men
into
line
one
minute
and
then
we
part
shouted
captain
chichester
to
his
party
for
a
wonder
with
temptation
on
every
side
the
weary
riders
obeyed
and
drew
up
in
a
straggling
line
to
hear
their
leader
parting
speech
men
i
promised
to
bring
you
here
safely
if
i
could
but
to
get
all
of
you
here
that
i
could
any
way
i
kept
my
promise
we
here
ay
three
cheers
for
sam
chichester
shouted
wild
bill
the
cheers
were
given
and
chichester
said
thank
you
boys
now
do
me
one
favor
you
are
here
in
a
busy
place
and
i
see
by
the
sign
that
benzine
is
about
as
plenty
as
water
touch
it
light
and
do
behave
yourselves
that
my
name
will
not
be
disgraced
by
any
of
sam
chichester
crowd
every
man
is
his
own
master
now
and
must
look
out
for
himself
i
wish
you
all
good
luck
and
shall
work
hard
for
it
myself
the
speech
was
over
and
in
a
second
the
line
melted
away
and
every
man
was
seeking
quarters
or
pitching
into
the
benzine
shops
wild
bill
would
have
been
the
first
to
go
there
had
not
his
companion
willie
pond
said
in
a
low
tone
bill
please
get
quarters
for
you
and
me
before
you
do
anything
else
you
know
what
you
have
promised
remember
if
it
had
not
been
for
me
neither
you
nor
one
of
this
party
would
ever
have
got
here
you
right
but
i
so
cussed
dry
muttered
bill
you
right
i
find
housing
for
us
two
before
a
drop
passes
my
lips
and
bill
rode
on
to
the
upper
part
of
the
town
as
it
might
be
called
where
some
men
were
putting
up
a
new
shanty
in
fact
just
putting
the
finishing
touch
on
it
by
hanging
a
door
will
you
sell
that
shebang
asked
bill
of
the
man
who
seemed
to
be
the
head
workman
yes
if
we
get
enough
we
can
build
another
what
will
you
give
these
two
horses
and
a
century
said
bill
pointing
to
the
animals
ridden
by
himself
and
companion
and
holding
up
a
bill
which
pond
had
furnished
him
the
house
is
yours
said
the
man
boys
put
for
timber
and
we
have
another
up
by
sunset
bill
and
his
companion
dismounted
removed
their
blankets
arms
and
into
the
house
gave
up
the
horses
and
were
at
home
it
did
not
take
long
to
settle
there
night
had
fallen
on
the
town
of
deadwood
but
not
the
calm
which
generally
comes
with
night
where
the
laborer
is
but
too
glad
to
greet
the
hour
of
rest
lights
flashing
through
chinks
in
rude
cabins
lights
shimmering
through
canvas
walls
songs
shouts
laughter
curses
and
drunken
yells
made
the
place
seem
like
a
pandemonium
on
earth
almost
every
other
structure
either
tent
cabin
or
more
pretentious
framed
house
was
either
a
saloon
or
or
both
combined
and
all
these
seemed
full
the
gulches
sinks
and
claims
that
had
been
the
scene
of
busy
labor
all
the
day
were
now
deserted
and
the
gold
just
wrenched
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
was
scattered
on
the
gambling
table
or
poured
into
the
drawer
of
the
busy
rumseller
at
this
same
hour
a
man
rode
into
the
edge
of
the
town
on
a
noble
black
horse
leading
a
tired
mustang
both
of
these
animals
he
staked
out
in
a
patch
of
grass
leaving
the
saddles
on
and
the
bridles
hanging
to
the
of
each
then
he
placed
his
rifle
against
a
tree
near
by
took
the
old
cartridges
out
of
a
and
put
in
fresh
ones
this
done
with
the
greatest
deliberation
he
pulled
his
slouch
hat
well
over
his
face
entered
the
nearest
saloon
threw
down
a
silver
dollar
and
called
for
brandy
a
bottle
and
glass
were
set
before
him
he
filled
the
glass
to
the
brim
drank
it
off
and
walked
out
here
you
cuss
here
cried
the
here
a
half
comin
to
you
we
only
charge
when
it
goes
by
wholesale
the
joke
fell
useless
for
the
man
had
not
remained
to
hear
it
in
the
largest
hall
in
the
place
a
heavy
gambling
game
was
going
on
there
was
roulette
faro
and
monte
all
at
different
points
before
the
there
was
the
greatest
gathering
wild
bill
furnished
with
money
by
the
person
known
to
us
so
far
as
willie
pond
was
bucking
against
the
bank
with
his
usual
wonderful
luck
and
the
crowd
centered
around
him
as
a
character
more
noted
and
better
known
than
any
other
who
had
yet
come
to
deadwood
i
bet
my
whole
pile
on
the
jack
shouted
wild
bill
who
had
taken
enough
strong
drink
to
fit
him
for
anything
do
be
careful
bill
do
be
careful
said
a
low
kind
voice
just
behind
him
it
was
that
of
willie
pond
oh
go
home
and
mind
your
business
i
break
this
bank
or
die
in
the
trial
cried
bill
defiantly
you
die
before
you
break
it
shrieked
out
a
shrill
sharp
voice
and
the
texan
sprang
forward
with
an
uplifted
and
lunged
with
deadly
aim
at
bill
heart
even
as
the
person
we
have
so
long
known
as
willie
pond
shrieked
out
save
oh
save
my
husband
but
another
hand
clutched
the
hilt
of
the
descending
knife
and
the
hand
of
a
short
thickset
desperado
was
shouted
as
he
drew
a
pistol
with
his
other
hand
wild
bill
is
my
game
no
one
living
shall
cheat
me
of
my
revenge
look
at
this
scar
bill
you
marked
me
for
and
now
i
mark
you
for
and
even
as
he
spoke
the
man
fired
and
a
pierced
wild
bill
heart
the
latter
who
had
risen
to
his
feet
staggered
toward
the
texan
who
struggled
to
free
his
from
the
clutch
of
the
real
assassin
and
with
a
wild
laugh
tore
the
false
hair
from
the
texan
head
as
a
roll
of
woman
hair
came
down
in
a
flood
of
beauty
over
her
shoulders
bill
gasped
out
jack
mccall
i
thankful
to
you
even
though
you
killed
me
wild
bill
does
not
die
by
the
hand
of
a
a
shudder
and
all
was
over
so
far
as
wild
bill
life
went
his
real
and
true
wife
wept
in
silence
over
his
body
while
sullen
and
for
a
time
silent
the
supposed
texan
stood
and
gazed
at
the
dead
body
then
she
spoke
addressing
mccall
villain
you
have
robbed
me
of
my
revenge
for
by
my
hand
should
that
man
have
fallen
no
wrong
he
could
have
done
you
can
be
more
bitter
than
that
which
put
me
on
his
and
made
me
swear
to
take
his
life
two
years
ago
a
young
man
left
a
ranch
close
to
the
rio
grande
border
with
a
thousand
head
of
cattle
which
had
been
bought
from
him
to
be
paid
for
when
delivered
in
abilene
kansas
he
was
noble
brave
handsome
he
was
good
and
true
in
all
things
he
was
the
only
hope
of
a
widowed
mother
the
very
idol
of
a
loving
sister
whose
life
seemed
linked
with
his
he
promised
when
he
left
those
he
loved
and
who
so
loved
him
that
he
would
hasten
back
with
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
and
then
with
his
mother
and
sister
he
would
return
to
the
birthplace
of
the
three
to
the
old
northern
homestead
where
his
father
remains
were
buried
buy
the
old
estate
and
settle
down
to
a
quiet
and
a
happy
life
long
anxiously
and
prayerfully
did
that
mother
and
sister
wait
for
his
return
did
he
come
no
but
the
news
came
which
like
a
thunderbolt
struck
that
mother
my
mother
dead
wild
and
despairing
i
heard
it
heard
the
son
the
brother
who
never
used
a
drop
of
strong
drink
in
all
his
life
who
never
uttered
an
oath
or
raised
a
hand
in
unkindness
to
man
or
woman
had
been
murdered
killed
without
provocation
no
chance
to
defend
his
life
no
warning
to
prepare
for
another
world
shot
down
in
mere
wantonness
there
lies
the
body
of
him
who
did
it
do
you
wonder
that
over
my
dead
mother
body
girl
though
i
was
i

my
oath
i
would
have
done
it
had
i
known
that
you

friends

limb
from
limb
before
his
body
was
cold
and
served
him
right
said
an
old
miner
whose
eyes
were
dimmed
with
moisture
while
the
texan

joe
who
bounded
from
the
house
when
it
was
discovered
that
the
murderer
had
slipped
away
in
the
moment
of
excitement
how
well
california
joe
kept
his
promise
history
has
already
recorded
followed
over

a
weary
mile
of
hill
and
prairie
mccall
was
finally
arrested
tried
and
convicted
as
well
by
his
own
boast
as
the
evidence
of
others
and
he
was
hanged

one
glance
at
our

she
cried
the
next
moment
she
passed
out
and
as
the
crowd
followed
to
see
whither
she
went
she
was
seen
to
spring
on
a
horse
which
stood
unhitched
before
the
door
and
on
it
she
rode
at
wild
speed
away
toward

a
saddled
but
unridden
mustang
followed
close
behind
her
the
course

took
