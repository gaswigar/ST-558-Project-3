jewdwine
had
made
the
most
remarkable
of
his
many
remarkable
discoveries
at
least
he
thought
he
had
he
could
not
be
quite
sure
which
was
his
excuse
for
referring
it
to
his
cousin
lucia
whose
instinct
he
would
not
call
it
judgement
in
these
matters
was
infallible
strangely
infallible
for
so
young
a
girl
what
he
wondered
would
she
say
to
savage
keith
rickman
on
saturday
when
he
first
came
down
into
devonshire
he
would
have
been
glad
to
know
but
which
was
a
tuesday
he
was
not
interested
in
rickman
to
eat
strawberries
all
morning
to
lie
out
in
the
hammock
all
afternoon
under
the
on
the
lawn
of
court
house
to
let
the
peace
of
the
old
green
garden
sink
into
him
to
look
at
lucia
and
forget
utterly
forget
about
his
work
the
making
of
discoveries
that
was
what
he
wanted
but
lucia
wanted
to
talk
and
to
talk
about
rickman
earnestly
as
if
he
were
a
burning
question
when
even
lying
in
the
hammock
jewdwine
was
so
hot
that
it
bothered
him
to
talk
at
all
he
was
beginning
to
be
sorry
that
he
had
introduced
him
the
exciting
topic
that
is
to
say
not
the
man
for
rickman
you
could
scarcely
introduce
not
at
any
rate
to
lucia
harden
well
lucia
he
pronounced
her
name
in
the
italian
manner
with
a
languid
stress
on
the
vowels
and
his
tone
conveyed
a
certain
weary
but
polite
forbearance
lucia
herself
he
noticed
had
an
ardent
look
as
if
a
particularly
interesting
idea
had
just
occurred
to
her
he
wished
it
had
an
idea
of
lucia
would
commit
him
to
an
opinion
of
his
own
and
at
the
moment
jewdwine
was
not
prepared
to
abandon
himself
to
anything
so
definite
and
irretrievable
he
had
not
yet
made
up
his
mind
about
rickman
and
did
not
want
to
make
it
up
now
certainty
was
impossible
owing
to
his
somewhat
embarrassing
acquaintance
with
the
man
that
again
was
where
lucia
had
come
in
her
vision
of
him
would
be
free
and
undisturbed
by
any
suggestion
of
his
bodily
presence
meanwhile
rickman
poem
or
rather
the
first
two
acts
of
his
drama
in
lay
on
lucia
lap
jewdwine
had
obtained
it
under
protest
and
with
much
secrecy
he
had
promised
rickman
solemnly
not
to
show
it
to
a
soul
but
he
had
shown
it
to
lucia
it
was
all
right
he
said
so
long
as
he
refrained
from
disclosing
the
name
of
the
person
who
had
written
it
not
that
she
would
have
been
any
the
wiser
if
he
had
and
it
was
you
who
discovered
him
her
voice
lingered
with
a
peculiarly
tender
and
agreeable
vibration
on
the
you
he
closed
his
eyes
and
let
that
too
sink
into
him
yes
he
murmured
nobody
else
has
had
a
hand
in
it
as
yet
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
now
you
have
discovered
him
he
opened
his
eyes
startled
by
the
uncomfortable
suggestion
it
had
not
yet
occurred
to
him
that
the
discovery
of
rickman
could
entail
any
responsibility
whatever
i
do
know
that
i
going
to
do
anything
with
him
unless
some
day
i
use
him
for
an
article
oh
horace
is
that
the
way
you
treat
your
friends
he
smiled
yes
lucy
sometimes
when
they
deserve
it
you
have
told
me
your
friend
name
no
i
betrayed
his
innocent
confidence
sufficiently
in
showing
you
his
play
i
ca
tell
you
his
name
after
all
his
name
does
matter
no
it
does
matter
very
likely
you
hear
enough
of
it
some
day
you
have
told
me
what
you
think
of
him
i
do
know
what
i
think
but
then
i
do
know
him
no
he
said
roused
to
interest
by
her
hesitation
you
do
know
him
that
the
beauty
of
it
she
gave
the
manuscript
back
into
his
hands
take
him
away
he
makes
me
feel
uncomfortable
to
tell
the
truth
lucy
he
makes
me
feel
uncomfortable
too
why
well
when
you
think
you
got
hold
of
a
genius
and
you
take
him
up
and
stake
your
reputation
on
him
and
all
the
time
you
ca
be
sure
whether
it
a
spark
of
the
divine
fire
or
a
mere
flash
in
the
pan
it
happens
over
and
over
again
the
burnt
critic
dreads
the
divine
fire
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
title
page
as
if
fascinated
by
the
words
in
but
this
is
not
bad
it
bad
for
two
and
twenty
only
two
and
twenty
that
all
it
looks
as
if
he
were
made
for
immortality
she
turned
to
him
that
ardent
gaze
which
made
the
hot
day
hotter
dear
horace
you
going
to
do
great
things
for
him
the
worst
of
having
a
cousin
who
adores
you
is
that
magnificence
is
expected
of
you
regularly
and
as
a
matter
of
course
he
was
not
even
sure
that
lucia
did
not
credit
him
with
power
to
work
miracles
the
idea
was
flattering
but
also
somewhat
inconvenient
i
do
know
about
great
things
i
should
like
to
do
something
the
question
is
what
he
a
little
unfortunate
in
in
his
surroundings
and
he
been
ill
poor
fellow
if
one
could
give
him
a
change
if
one
were
only
rich
and
could
afford
to
send
him
abroad
for
a
year
i
thought
of
asking
him
down
to
oxford
and
why
did
you
well
you
know
one
gets
rather
crowded
up
with
things
in
term
time
lucia
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
refined
luxurious
figure
in
the
hammock
horace
was
entitled
to
the
hammock
for
he
had
been
ill
he
was
entitled
also
to
the
ministrations
of
his
cousin
lucia
lucia
spent
her
time
in
planning
and
doing
kind
things
and
from
the
sudden
luminous
sweetness
of
her
face
he
gathered
that
something
of
the
sort
was
in
preparation
now
it
was
horace
she
said
would
you
like
to
ask
him
here
no
lucy
i
would
i
do
think
it
would
do
but
why
not
if
he
your
friend
if
he
my
friend
you
he
was
your
friend
you
did
you
know
another
awkward
consequence
of
a
cousin
adoration
she
is
apt
to
remember
and
attach
importance
to
your
most
trivial
utterances
pardon
me
i
said
he
was
my
find
where
did
you
find
him
i
found
him
in
the
city
in
a
shop
she
smiled
at
the
rhythmic
utterance
the
tragedy
of
the
revelation
was
such
that
it
could
be
expressed
only
in
blank
verse
the
shop
does
matter
no
but
he
does
you
could
stand
him
lucia
you
see
for
one
thing
he
sometimes
drops
his
aitches
well
if
he
does
he
be
out
all
day
and
there
the
open
country
to
drop
them
in
i
really
do
mind
if
you
like
to
ask
him
do
you
think
he
like
to
be
asked
there
no
possible
doubt
about
that
then
ask
him
ask
him
now
you
ca
do
it
when
father
not
at
home
jewdwine
repressed
a
smile
even
now
from
the
windows
of
the
east
wing
there
burst
suddenly
the
sound
of
fiddling
a
masterly
fiddling
inspired
by
infernal
passion
controlled
by
divine
technique
it
was
his
uncle
sir
frederick
and
he
wished
him
at
the
devil
if
all
accounts
were
true
sir
frederick
when
not
actually
fiddling
was
going
there
with
a
celerity
that
left
nothing
to
be
desired
he
was
if
you
came
to
think
of
it
a
rather
amazing
sort
of
chaperone
and
yet
but
for
that
fleeting
and
tumultuous
presence
horace
himself
would
not
be
staying
at
court
house
really
he
reflected
lucia
ought
to
get
some
lady
to
live
with
her
it
was
the
correct
thing
and
therefore
it
was
not
a
little
surprising
that
lucia
did
not
do
it
an
expression
of
disapproval
passed
over
his
pale
fastidious
face
father
wo
mind
she
said
no
but
i
should
he
said
it
in
a
tone
which
was
meant
to
settle
the
question
she
sat
still
turning
over
the
pages
of
the
manuscript
which
she
had
again
taken
on
her
lap
i
suppose
he
is
very
dreadful
still
i
think
we
ought
to
do
something
for
him
and
what
would
you
propose
to
do
there
was
an
irritating
smile
on
her
cousin
face
he
was
thinking
so
she
wants
to
patronize
him
does
she
he
did
not
say
what
he
thought
with
lucia
that
was
unnecessary
for
she
always
knew
he
only
said
i
do
exactly
see
you
playing
beatrice
to
his
dante
lucia
coloured
and
horace
felt
that
he
had
been
right
the
hardens
had
always
been
patronizing
his
mother
and
sister
were
the
most
superbly
patronizing
women
he
knew
and
rickman
might
or
might
not
be
a
great
man
but
lucia
even
at
three
and
twenty
was
a
great
lady
in
her
way
why
should
she
patronize
him
if
she
liked
and
he
smiled
again
more
irritatingly
than
ever
nobody
could
be
more
irritating
than
this
oxford
don
when
he
gave
his
mind
to
it
lucy
if
you
only
knew
him
i
do
think
you
suggest
my
bringing
him
down
here
he
was
smiling
still
while
his
imagination
dallied
with
the
monstrous
vision
i
would
have
suggested
it
she
said
coldly
if
i
had
thought
you
like
it
horace
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
himself
he
knew
he
had
only
to
think
about
lucia
in
her
presence
to
change
the
colour
on
her
cheeks
and
his
last
thought
had
left
a
stain
there
like
the
mark
of
a
blow
never
had
he
known
any
woman
so
sensitive
as
his
cousin
lucia
so
i
should
like
it
dear
if
it
were
possible
or
rather
if
were
not
impossible
his
manners
have
not
that
repose
which
distinguishes
his
really
for
two
and
twenty
he
is
marvellously
restrained
restrained
do
you
think
so
certainly
he
said
his
thought
gaining
precision
in
opposition
to
her
vagueness
his
is
pure
vere
de
vere
you
might
read
me
some
of
it
she
read
and
in
the
golden
afternoon
her
voice
built
up
the
cold
polished
marble
of
the
verse
she
had
not
been
able
to
tell
him
what
she
thought
of
rickman
but
her
voice
in
its
profound
vibrations
made
apparent
that
which
she
and
she
only
had
discerned
in
him
the
troubled
pulse
of
youth
the
passion
of
the
imprisoned
and
tumultuous
soul
the
soul
which
horace
had
assured
her
inhabited
the
body
of
an
aitchless
shopman
lucia
might
not
have
the
intuition
of
genius
but
she
had
the
genius
of
intuition
she
had
seen
what
the
great
oxford
critic
had
not
been
able
to
see
the
sound
of
the
fiddling
ceased
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
and
over
the
grey
house
and
the
green
garden
was
the
peace
of
heaven
and
of
the
enfolding
hills
jewdwine
breathed
a
sigh
of
contentment
at
the
close
of
the
great
chorus
in
the
second
act
after
all
rickman
was
the
best
antidote
to
rickman
but
lucia
was
looking
ardent
again
as
if
she
were
about
to
speak
do
lucy
he
murmured
do
what
do
talk
any
more
about
him
now
it
too
hot
wait
till
the
cool
of
the
evening
i
thought
you
wanted
me
to
play
to
you
then
jewdwine
looked
at
her
he
noted
the
purity
of
her
face
the
beautiful
pose
of
her
body
stretched
in
the
her
fine
white
hands
and
arms
that
hung
there
slender
inert
and
frail
he
admired
these
things
so
much
that
he
failed
to
see
that
they
expressed
not
only
beauty
but
a
certain
delicacy
of
physique
and
that
her
languor
which
appealed
to
him
was
the
languor
of
fatigue
you
might
play
to
me
now
he
said
she
looked
at
him
again
a
lingering
meditative
look
a
look
in
which
if
adoration
was
quiescent
there
was
no
criticism
and
no
reproach
only
a
melancholy
wonder
and
he
too
wondered
wondered
what
she
was
thinking
of
she
was
thinking
a
dreadful
thought
is
horace
selfish
is
horace
selfish
a
little
voice
kept
calling
at
the
back
of
her
brain
and
would
not
be
quiet
at
last
she
answered
it
to
her
own
satisfaction
no
he
is
not
selfish
he
is
only
and
presently
as
if
on
mature
consideration
she
rose
and
went
into
the
house
his
eyes
followed
well
pleased
the
delicate
undulations
of
her
figure
horace
jewdwine
was
the
most
exacting
the
most
fastidious
of
men
his
entire
nature
was
dominated
by
the
critical
faculty
in
him
and
lucia
satisfied
its
most
difficult
demands
try
as
he
would
there
was
really
nothing
in
her
which
he
could
take
exception
to
barring
her
absurd
adoration
of
his
uncle
frederick
and
even
that
when
you
came
to
think
of
it
flowed
from
the
innocence
which
was
more
than
half
her
charm
he
could
not
say
positively
wherein
her
beauty
consisted
therefore
he
was
always
tempted
to
look
at
her
in
the
hope
of
finding
out
there
was
nothing
insistent
and
nothing
obvious
about
it
some
women
for
instance
irritated
your
admiration
by
the
capricious
prettiness
of
one
or
two
features
or
fatigued
it
by
the
monotonous
regularity
of
all
the
beauty
of
others
was
vulgarized
by
the
flamboyance
of
some
irrelevant
detail
such
as
hair
lucia
hair
was
merely
dark
and
it
made
as
hair
should
make
the
simplest
adornment
for
her
head
the
most
perfect
setting
for
her
face
as
for
her
features
though
it
was
impossible
to
think
of
them
or
anything
about
her
as
incorrect
they
eluded
while
they
fascinated
him
by
their
subtlety
lucia
beauty
in
short
appealed
to
him
because
it
did
not
commit
him
to
any
irretrievable
opinion
but
nothing
not
even
her
beauty
pleased
him
better
than
the
way
in
which
she
managed
her
intellect
divining
by
some
infallible
instinct
how
much
of
it
was
wanted
by
any
given
listener
at
a
given
time
she
had
none
of
the
nasty
tricks
that
clever
women
have
always
on
the
look
out
to
go
one
better
and
to
catch
you
tripping
her
lucidity
was
remarkable
but
it
served
to
show
up
other
people
strong
points
rather
than
her
own
lucia
did
not
impress
you
as
being
clever
and
jewdwine
who
had
a
clever
man
natural
distaste
for
clever
women
admired
his
cousin
intellect
as
well
he
might
for
it
was
he
who
had
taught
her
how
to
use
it
her
sense
of
humour
too
for
lucia
was
dangerously
gifted
that
sense
which
more
than
any
of
her
senses
can
wreck
a
woman
he
would
have
liked
her
just
as
well
if
she
had
had
none
but
some
no
doubt
she
needed
if
only
to
save
her
from
the
situations
to
which
her
kindness
and
her
innocence
exposed
her
and
she
had
just
the
right
amount
and
no
more
heavens
supposing
without
it
she
had
met
keith
rickman
and
had
yielded
to
the
temptation
to
be
kind
to
him
even
in
the
heat
jewdwine
shivered
at
the
thought
he
put
it
from
him
he
put
rickman
altogether
from
his
mind
it
was
not
to
think
about
rickman
that
he
came
down
to
court
house
on
a
day
as
hot
as
this
he
wanted
nothing
but
to
keep
cool
the
gentle
oscillation
of
the
hammock
in
the
green
shadows
of
the
symbolized
this
attitude
towards
rickman
and
all
other
ardent
questions
still
it
was
not
disagreeable
to
know
that
if
he
could
only
make
up
his
mind
to
something
very
definite
and
irretrievable
indeed
court
house
would
one
day
be
his
it
was
the
only
house
in
england
that
came
up
to
his
idea
of
what
a
country
house
should
be
a
square
tudor
building
with
two
short
wings
thrown
out
at
right
angles
to
its
front
three
friendly
grey
walls
enclosing
a
little
courtyard
made
golden
all
day
long
with
sunshine
from
the
south
court
house
was
older
than
anything
near
it
except
harmouth
bridge
and
the
parish
church
standing
apart
in
its
own
green
lands
it
looked
older
than
the
young
red
earth
beneath
it
a
mass
upheaved
from
the
grey
foundations
of
the
hills
its
face
turned
seawards
was
rough
and
pitted
with
the
salt
air
thousands
upon
thousands
of
lichens
gave
it
a
greenish
bloom
with
here
and
there
a
rusty
patch
on
groin
and
gable
it
contained
the
harden
library
harden
library
one
of
the
finest
private
collections
in
the
country
it
contained
also
his
cousin
lucia
he
had
always
loved
court
house
but
not
always
his
cousin
lucia
the
scholarly
descendant
of
a
long
line
of
scholars
jewdwine
knew
that
he
had
been
a
favourite
with
his
grandfather
sir
joseph
harden
the
master
of
lazarus
he
was
convinced
erroneously
that
he
was
a
harden
by
blood
and
by
temperament
and
of
course
if
he
had
only
been
a
harden
by
name
and
not
a
jewdwine
court
house
and
the
great
harden
library
would
have
been
his
instead
of
his
cousin
lucia
he
knew
that
his
grandfather
had
wished
them
to
be
his
lucia
mother
was
dead
long
ago
and
when
his
uncle
sir
frederick
definitely
renounced
the
domestic
life
lucia
and
lucia
alone
stood
between
him
and
the
inheritance
that
should
have
been
his
this
hardly
constituted
a
reason
for
being
fond
of
lucia
his
grandfather
had
wished
him
to
be
fond
of
her
but
not
until
jewdwine
was
five
and
twenty
and
began
to
feel
the
primordial
manhood
stirring
in
his
scholarly
blood
did
he
perceive
that
his
cousin
lucia
was
not
a
hindrance
but
a
way
the
way
was
so
obvious
that
it
was
no
wonder
that
he
did
not
see
it
all
at
once
he
did
not
really
see
it
till
sir
joseph
sent
for
him
on
his
there
been
some
mistake
horace
sir
joseph
had
then
said
your
mother
should
have
been
the
boy
and
your
uncle
frederick
the
girl
then
lucia
would
have
been
a
jewdwine
and
you
a
harden
and
horace
had
said
i
afraid
i
ca
be
a
harden
sir
but
is
there
any
reason
why
lucia
i
was
coming
to
that
said
sir
joseph
but
he
never
came
to
it
horace
however
was
in
some
way
aware
that
the
same
idea
had
occurred
to
both
of
them
whatever
it
was
the
old
man
had
died
happy
in
it
there
was
no
engagement
only
a
something
altogether
intangible
and
vague
understood
to
be
an
understanding
and
lucia
adored
him
if
she
had
not
adored
him
he
might
have
been
urged
to
something
irretrievable
and
definite
as
it
was
there
was
no
need
and
nothing
could
have
been
more
soothing
than
the
golden
concord
of
that
understanding
needless
to
say
if
lucia
had
been
anybody
but
lucia
such
a
solution
would
have
been
impossible
he
was
fastidious
he
would
not
have
married
a
woman
simply
because
his
grandfather
wished
it
and
he
could
not
have
married
a
woman
simply
because
she
inherited
property
that
ought
to
have
been
his
and
he
could
not
have
married
any
woman
who
would
have
suspected
him
of
such
brutality
he
could
only
marry
a
woman
who
was
consummately
suitable
to
him
in
whom
nothing
jarred
nothing
offended
and
his
cousin
lucia
was
such
a
woman
the
very
fact
that
she
was
his
cousin
was
an
assurance
of
her
rightness
it
followed
that
love
being
the
expression
of
that
perfect
and
predestined
harmony
he
could
only
marry
for
love
not
for
a
great
estate
for
court
house
and
the
harden
library
no
to
do
him
justice
his
seeking
of
lucia
was
independent
of
his
reflection
that
these
things
would
be
added
unto
him
still
once
married
to
lucia
there
was
only
sir
frederick
and
his
infernal
fiddle
between
him
and
ultimate
inviolable
possession
and
sir
frederick
to
use
his
own
phrase
had
about
played
himself
out
from
what
a
stage
and
to
what
mad
music
from
the
east
wing
came
the
sound
not
of
his
uncle
fiddle
but
of
the
music
he
desired
the
tremendous
and
difficult
music
that
on
a
hot
july
afternoon
taxed
the
delicate
player
strength
to
its
utmost
lucia
began
with
scarlatti
and
bach
wandered
off
through
schumann
into
chopin
a
moonlit
enchanted
wilderness
of
sound
paused
and
wound
up
superbly
with
beethoven
the
sonata
appassionata
and
as
she
came
back
to
him
over
the
green
lawn
she
seemed
to
jewdwine
to
be
trailing
tumultuous
echoes
of
her
music
the
splendour
and
the
passion
of
her
playing
hung
about
her
like
a
luminous
cloud
he
rose
and
went
to
meet
her
and
in
his
eyes
there
was
a
light
a
light
of
wonder
and
of
worship
i
think
she
said
you
do
look
a
little
happier
i
am
tolerably
happy
thanks
so
am
i
yes
but
do
look
it
what
are
you
thinking
of
she
turned
and
they
walked
together
towards
the
house
i
was
thinking
it
quite
cool
now
horace
of
what
you
said
about
that
friend
of
yours
lucy
was
i
rude
did
i
make
you
unhappy
not
you
do
you
see
that
it
just
because
i
happy
that
i
want
to
be
kind
to
him
just
like
your
sweetness
but
dear
child
you
ca
be
kind
to
everybody
it
really
does
do
she
said
no
more
she
had
certainly
something
else
to
think
about
that
was
on
a
tuesday
a
hot
afternoon
in
july
eighteen
chapter
ii
it
was
wednesday
evening
in
april
eighteen
spring
was
coming
up
on
the
south
wind
from
the
river
spring
was
in
the
narrow
streets
and
in
the
great
highway
of
the
strand
and
in
a
certain
bookseller
shop
in
the
strand
and
it
was
easter
not
to
say
bank
holiday
already
in
the
soul
of
the
young
man
who
sat
there
compiling
the
quarterly
catalogue
for
it
was
in
the
days
of
his
obscurity
the
shop
a
corner
one
was
part
of
a
gigantic
modern
structure
with
a
decorated
façade
in
pinkish
and
topped
by
four
pinkish
cupolas
it
was
brutally
tyrannously
imposing
it
towered
above
its
neighbours
dwarfing
the
long
of
the
strand
its
flushed
cupolas
mocked
the
white
and
heavenly
soaring
of
mary
whether
you
approached
it
from
the
river
or
from
the
city
or
from
the
west
you
could
see
nothing
else
so
monstrous
was
it
so
flagrant
and
so
new
though
the
day
was
not
yet
done
the
electric
light
streamed
over
the
pavement
from
the
huge
windows
of
the
ground
floor
a
coronal
of
dazzling
globes
hung
over
the
doorway
at
the
corner
there
as
you
turned
the
sombre
windows
of
the
department
stretched
half
way
down
the
side
street
here
in
the
great
thoroughfare
the
newest
of
new
books
stood
out
solicitous
and
alluring
in
suits
of
blazing
scarlet
and
vivid
green
of
vellum
and
gilt
of
polished
leather
that
shone
like
amber
and
malachite
and
lapis
lazuli
within
a
wall
broken
by
a
wide
and
lofty
arch
divided
the
front
from
the
back
shop
on
the
right
of
the
arch
was
the
mahogany
pew
of
the
cashier
on
the
left
a
tall
pillar
stove
radiating
intolerable
heat
four
steps
led
through
the
arch
into
the
back
shop
the
floor
of
which
was
raised
in
a
sort
of
platform
on
the
platform
was
a
table
and
at
the
table
sat
the
young
man
compiling
the
quarterly
catalogue
front
shop
and
back
shop
reeked
with
the
smells
of
new
mahogany
dust
gum
paper
and
russia
leather
he
sat
in
the
middle
of
them
in
an
atmosphere
so
thick
that
it
could
be
seen
hanging
about
him
like
an
aura
luminous
in
the
glare
of
the
electric
light
his
slender
nervous
hands
worked
rapidly
with
a
air
of
dexterity
and
dispatch
but
every
now
and
then
he
raised
his
head
and
stared
for
quite
a
long
time
at
the
round
white
foolish
face
of
the
clock
and
whenever
he
did
this
his
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
a
young
man
who
has
no
adequate
sense
of
his
surroundings
the
remarkable
thing
about
the
new
shop
was
that
already
like
a
bar
or
a
restaurant
it
drew
to
it
a
certain
group
of
young
men
punctually
irresistibly
a
small
group
you
could
almost
count
them
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand
they
came
from
fleet
street
from
the
temple
from
the
junior
journalists
club
over
the
way
they
were
never
seen
looking
in
at
the
windows
or
hanging
about
the
counter
they
were
not
the
least
bit
of
good
to
the
shop
those
customers
but
they
were
evidently
some
good
to
the
young
man
whatever
they
did
or
did
not
do
they
always
ended
by
drifting
to
the
platform
to
his
table
they
sat
on
it
in
friendly
attitudes
and
talked
to
him
he
was
so
glad
to
be
talked
to
so
frankly
engagingly
beautifully
glad
that
the
pathos
of
it
would
have
been
too
poignant
the
obligation
it
almost
forced
on
you
too
unbearable
but
for
his
power
his
monstrous
mysterious
personal
glamour
it
lay
partly
no
doubt
in
his
appearance
not
no
not
at
all
in
his
he
wore
like
a
thousand
city
clerks
a
high
collar
a
speckled
tie
a
straight
dark
blue
serge
suit
but
in
spite
of
the
stiffness
thus
imposed
on
him
he
had
unaccountably
the
shy
savage
beauty
of
an
animal
untamed
uncaught
he
belonged
to
the
slender
nervous
fair
type
but
the
colour
proper
to
it
had
been
taken
out
of
him
by
the
shop
his
head
presented
the
utmost
clearness
of
line
compatible
with
irregularity
of
outline
and
his
face
from
its
heavy
square
forehead
to
its
light
square
jaw
was
full
of
strange
harmonies
adjustments
compensations
his
chin
rather
long
in
a
front
view
rather
prominent
in
profile
balanced
the
powerful
proportions
of
his
forehead
his
upper
lip
in
spite
of
its
slender
arch
betrayed
a
youthful
eagerness
of
the
senses
but
this
effect
was
subtilized
by
the
fineness
of
his
lower
lip
and
when
they
closed
it
disappeared
in
the
sudden
serious
straightening
of
the
lines
even
his
nose
otherwise
a
firm
feature
straight
in
the
bridge
and
rather
broad
at
the
end
became
grave
or
eager
as
the
pose
of
the
head
hid
or
revealed
the
nostrils
he
had
queer
eyes
of
a
thick
dark
blue
large
though
deep
set
showing
a
great
deal
of
iris
and
very
little
white
without
being
he
was
good
to
look
at
when
you
could
look
long
enough
to
find
all
these
things
out
he
did
not
like
being
looked
at
if
you
tried
to
hold
him
that
way
his
eyes
were
all
over
the
place
seeking
an
escape
but
they
held
whether
you
liked
it
or
not
it
was
uncanny
that
fascination
if
he
had
chosen
to
exert
it
in
the
interests
of
his
shop
he
could
presumably
have
cleaned
those
friendly
young
men
out
any
day
but
he
never
did
exert
it
surrounded
by
wares
whose
very
appearance
was
a
venal
solicitation
he
never
hinted
by
so
much
as
the
turn
of
a
phrase
that
there
was
anything
about
him
to
be
bought
and
after
what
had
passed
between
them
they
felt
that
to
hint
it
themselves
to
him
would
have
been
the
last
indelicacy
if
they
ever
asked
the
price
of
a
book
it
was
to
propitiate
the
grim
grizzled
fellow
so
like
a
methodist
parson
who
glared
at
them
from
the
counter
they
kept
their
discovery
to
themselves
as
if
it
had
been
something
too
precious
to
be
handled
as
if
its
charm
the
poetry
the
pathos
of
it
must
escape
under
discussion
but
any
of
them
who
did
compare
notes
agreed
that
their
first
idea
had
been
that
the
shop
was
absurdly
too
big
for
the
young
man
their
next
that
the
young
man
was
too
big
for
the
shop
miles
oh
miles
too
big
for
it
their
final
impression
being
the
tragedy
of
the
disproportion
the
misfit
then
sadly
with
lowered
voices
they
admitted
that
he
had
one
flaw
when
the
poor
fellow
got
excited
do
you
know
he
sometimes
dropt
no
no
he
skipped
his
aitches
it
did
happen
often
but
they
felt
it
terrible
that
it
should
happen
at
all
to
him
they
touched
it
tenderly
if
it
was
not
exactly
part
of
his
poetry
it
was
part
of
his
pathos
the
shop
was
responsible
for
it
he
ought
never
never
to
have
been
there
and
yet
bad
as
it
was
they
felt
that
he
must
be
consoled
sustained
by
what
he
knew
about
himself
what
it
was
inconceivable
that
he
should
not
know
he
may
indeed
have
reflected
with
some
complacency
that
in
spite
of
everything
his
great
classic
drama
in
was
lying
finished
in
the
drawer
in
his
bedroom
and
that
for
the
last
month
those
very
modern
poems
that
he
called
had
been
careering
through
the
columns
of
but
at
the
moment
he
was
mainly
supported
by
the
coming
of
easter
chapter
iii
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
that
shop
in
the
strand
was
and
but
he
savage
keith
rickman
had
much
preferred
the
dark
little
shop
in
the
city
where
he
had
laboured
as
a
boy
there
was
something
soothing
in
its
very
obscurity
and
retirement
he
could
sit
there
for
an
hour
at
a
time
peacefully
reading
his
homer
in
that
agreeable
dusty
twilight
outward
forms
were
dimmed
with
familiarity
and
dirt
his
dreams
took
shape
before
him
they
came
and
went
at
will
undisturbed
by
any
gross
collision
with
reality
there
was
hardly
any
part
of
it
that
was
not
consecrated
by
some
divine
visitation
it
was
in
the
corner
by
the
window
standing
on
a
and
fumbling
in
the
darkness
for
a
copy
of
demosthenes
that
he
lit
on
his
first
idea
from
his
seat
behind
the
counter
staring
as
was
his
custom
into
the
recess
where
the
was
he
first
saw
the
immortal
face
of
helen
in
leuce
here
all
that
beautiful
world
of
thought
lay
open
to
the
terrific
invasion
of
things
his
dreams
refused
to
stand
out
with
sufficient
distinctness
from
a
background
of
coloured
bindings
plate
glass
and
mahogany
they
were
liable
at
any
moment
to
be
broken
by
the
violent
contours
of
customers
a
sight
of
helen
in
leuce
could
be
obtained
only
by
dint
of
much
concentrated
staring
at
the
clock
and
as
often
as
not
rickman
eye
dropt
its
visionary
freight
on
encountering
the
cashier
eye
in
its
passage
from
the
clock
to
the
paper
but
as
he
reflected
with
some
humour
though
rickman
ideas
so
frequently
miscarried
owing
to
that
malignant
influence
his
genius
like
nature
irresistible
and
indestructible
compelled
him
perpetually
to
bring
forth
exposed
on
his
little
daïs
or
platform
in
hideous
publicity
he
suffered
the
divine
labour
and
agony
of
creation
he
was
the
slave
of
his
passion
and
his
hour
chapter
iv
a
wave
of
heat
broke
from
the
and
spread
through
the
shop
strewing
the
heavier
smells
like
a
wrack
behind
it
and
through
it
all
with
every
swing
of
the
great
mahogany
doors
there
stole
into
his
young
senses
a
something
delicious
and
disturbing
faintly
discernible
as
the
spring
he
thrust
his
work
from
him
tilted
back
his
chair
at
a
dangerous
angle
and
began
reviewing
his
engagements
for
the
coming
bank
holiday
he
was
only
three
and
twenty
and
at
three
and
twenty
an
infinite
measure
of
life
can
be
pressed
into
the
great
three
days
he
saw
in

the

of

but
of

noons
and
flaming
saturday

and
of
a

many

besides

had
made

beforehand

to

good
friday
morning
an
cycling
before
breakfast
in
regent
park
by
way
of
pumping
some
air
into
his
lungs
then
ten
hours
at
least
of
high
parnassian
leisure
of
dalliance
in
academic
shades
he
saw
himself
wooing
some
reluctant
classic
or
far
more
likely
flirting
with
his
own
capricious
and
bewildering
muse
in
a
world
of
prose
it
is
only
by
such
divine
snatches
that
poets
are
made

saturday
morning
recovery
from
dinner
at
the
junior
journalists
saturday
afternoon
to
hampstead
or
the
hippodrome
with
flossie
walker
the
little
clerk
who
lived
in
his
and
never
had
any
fun
to
speak
of
saturday
night
supper
with
well
with
miss
poppy
grace
of
the
jubilee
variety
theatre
he
had
a
sudden
vision
of
poppy
as
he
was
wont
to
meet
her
in
delightful
intimacy
instantaneously
followed
by
her
image
that
flaunted
on
the
posters
out
there
in
the
strand
poppy
as
she
appeared
behind
the
in
red
silk
skirts
and
black
silk
stockings
skimming
whirling
swaying
and
deftly
shaking
her
foot
at
him
midnight
and
morning
merging
into
one
sunday
to
richmond
probably
with
poppy
and
some
others
monday
up
the
river
with
himself
not
for
worlds
that
is
to
say
not
for
any
amount
of
poppies
would
he
have
broken
his
appointment
with
that
brilliant
and
yet
inscrutable
companion
who
is
so
eternally
fascinating
at
monday
was
indistinct
but
luminous
a
restless
shimmering
background
for
ideas
ideas
they
swarmed
like
motes
in
the
blue
air
they
loomed
they
floated
vague
and
somewhat
supernaturally
large
all
made
out
of
rickman
brain
and
in
the
midst
of
the
ideas
a
figure
insanely
whirled
till
it
became
a
mere
wheel
of
flying
skirts
and
tossing
limbs
at
this
point
rickman
caught
the
cashier
eye
looking
at
him
over
the
little
mahogany
rails
of
his
pew
and
he
began
wondering
how
on
earth
the
cashier
would
behave
when
they
loosed
him
out
for
the
bank
holiday
then
he
set
to
and
wrote
hard
at
the
quarterly
catalogue
in
all
london
there
was
not
a
more
prolific
or
versatile
writer
than
savage
keith
rickman
but
if
in
you
had
asked
him
for
his
masterpiece
his
his
he
would
mention
nothing
that
he
had
written
but
refer
you
soberly
and
benignly
to
that
colossal
performance
the
quarterly
catalogue
vandam
amours
of
great
men
a
little
soiled
rare
he
was
in
the
middle
of
the
vs
now
and
within
measurable
distance
of
the
end
business
being
slack
in
the
front
shop
he
finished
earlier
than
usual
and
actually
found
himself
with
nearly
a
whole
hour
upon
his
hands
before
dinner
he
had
half
a
mind
to
spend
it
at
his
club
the
junior
journalists
in
the
side
street
over
the
way
only
half
a
mind
for
rickman
entertained
the
most
innocent
beliefs
with
regard
to
that
club
of
his
he
was
not
yet
sure
whether
it
belonged
to
him
or
he
to
it
but
in
going
to
the
junior
journalists
he
conceived
himself
to
be
going
into
society
so
extreme
was
his
illusion
rickman
place
was
in
the
shop
and
his
home
was
in
a
boarding
house
and
for
years
he
had
thought
of
belonging
to
that
club
but
quite
hopelessly
as
of
a
thing
beyond
attainment
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
anything
could
come
of
those
invasions
of
the
friendly
young
men
yet
this
was
what
had
come
of
them
he
was
friends
under
the
rose
that
is
to
say
over
the
counter
with
horace
jewdwine
of
lazarus
college
oxford
jewdwine
had
proposed
him
on
his
own
merits
somebody
else
had
seconded
him
he
supposed
on
jewdwine
and
between
them
they
had
smuggled
him
in
this
would
be
his
first
appearance
as
a
junior
journalist
and
he
might
well
feel
a
little
diffident
about
it
for
though
some
of
the
members
knew
him
he
could
not
honestly
say
he
knew
any
of
them
except
rankin
of
who
possibly
might
and
jewdwine
who
certainly
would
be
there
but
the
plunge
had
to
be
made
some
time
he
might
as
well
make
it
now
from
the
threshold
of
the
junior
journalists
he
looked
back
across
the
side
street
as
across
a
gulf
at
the
place
he
had
just
left
his
eyes
moved
from
the
jutting
at
the
corner
announcing
libraries
to
the
legend
that
ran
above
the
window
blazoned
in
letters
of
gold
rickman
new
his
connexion
with
it
was
by
no
means
casual
and
temporary
it
was
his
father
shop
chapter
v
the
little
booksellers
of
the
strand
in
their
death
struggle
against
rickman
never
cursed
that
house
more
heartily
than
did
the
junior
journalists
in
their
friendly
shabby
little
den
smelling
of
old
leather
and
tobacco
and
the
town
they
complained
that
it
cut
on
of
the
light
from
the
front
windows
of
the
not
that
any
of
them
were
ever
known
to
read
in
it
they
used
it
chiefly
as
a
place
to
talk
in
for
which
purpose
little
illumination
was
required
one
of
the
windows
in
question
was
occupied
by
a
small
group
of
talkers
isolated
from
the
rest
there
was
mackinnon
of
literary
there
were
the
three
wild
young
spirits
of
stables
who
had
launched
it
with
frightful
impetus
into
space
having
borrowed
a
sum
sufficient
for
the
purpose
maddox
who
controlled
its
course
and
rankin
whose
brilliance
made
it
twinkle
so
brightly
in
the
firmament
with
them
but
emphatically
not
of
them
was
horace
jewdwine
of
lazarus
who
had
come
up
from
oxford
to
join
the
staff
of
jewdwine
and
mackinnon
both
secure
of
a
position
and
a
salary
looked
solemn
and
a
little
anxious
but
the
men
of
having
formed
themselves
into
a
sort
of
unlimited
liability
company
and
started
a
brand
new
weekly
of
their
own
upon
no
sort
of
security
beyond
their
bare
brains
were
as
persons
without
a
single
care
worry
or
responsibility
they
were
exchanging
ideas
in
an
and
manner
the
only
stipulation
being
that
the
ideas
must
be
new
for
by
some
unwritten
law
of
the
club
the
conversational
currency
was
liable
at
any
moment
to
be
called
in
this
evening
however
they
had
hit
on
a
topic
almost
virgin
from
the
mint
is
he
is
he
said
mackinnon
i
ca
tell
you
what
he
but
i
can
pretty
soon
tell
you
what
he
not
said
stables
he
was
a
very
young
man
with
a
white
face
and
red
eyelids
who
looked
as
if
he
sat
up
all
night
and
went
to
bed
in
the
as
indeed
he
generally
did
negatio
est
murmured
jewdwine
without
looking
up
from
the
letter
he
was
trying
to
write
what
has
he
done
persisted
mackinnon
he
done
a
great
many
remarkable
things
said
rankin
things
almost
as
remarkable
as
himself
who
unearthed
him
i
did
said
rankin
so
complacently
that
the
deep
lines
relaxed
round
the
five
bosses
that
were
his
chin
and
cheeks
and
brow
the
rest
of
rankin
face
was
spectacles
and
moustache
oh
did
you
said
maddox
maddox
was
a
short
man
with
large
shoulders
heavy
browed
heavy
jowled
heavy
moustached
appearance
belied
him
he
looked
british
when
he
was
half
celt
he
struck
you
as
overbearing
when
he
was
only
he
spoke
as
if
he
was
angry
when
he
was
only
in
fun
as
you
could
see
by
his
eyes
little
babyish
blue
eyes
they
were
with
curly
corners
a
gay
light
in
the
sombre
truculence
of
his
face
they
looked
cautiously
round
i
can
tell
you
a
little
tale
about
you
know
the
last
time
smythe
was
ill
you
mean
drunk
well
temporarily
extinguished
who
knows
his
was
offered
smythe
berth
we
delicately
intimated
to
him
that
if
he
liked
at
any
time
to
devote
a
little
paragraph
to
miss
poppy
grace
he
was
at
perfect
liberty
to
do
so
a
liberty
he
interpreted
as
poetic
licence
nothing
of
the
sort
he
absolutely
declined
the
job
why
well
the
marvellous
boy
informed
me
that
he
was
too
intimate
with
the
lady
to
write
about
her
at
any
rate
with
that
noble
impartiality
which
distinguishes
the
utterances
of
steady
man
he
told
ye
said
mackinnon
i
did
say
he
me
i
said
he
informed
me
and
whar
the
i
do
see
it
at
all
trepan
him
trepan
him
stables
took
out
his
penknife
and
indicated
by
dumb
show
a
surgical
operation
on
mackinnon
head
i
gathered
it
continued
maddox
suavely
from
his
manner
i
culled
his
young
thought
like
a
flower
perhaps
rankin
suggested
he
was
afraid
of
compromising
poppy
he
might
have
left
that
subtle
consideration
to
pilkington
that
was
it
he
scented
dicky
hand
in
it
and
was
particularly
anxious
to
oblige
him
the
point
of
the
joke
is
that
he
happens
to
owe
dicky
a
great
deal
more
than
he
can
conveniently
pay
that
give
you
some
faint
notion
of
the
magnificence
of
his
cheek
stables
was
impressed
he
wondered
what
sort
of
young
man
it
could
be
who
had
the
moral
courage
to
oppose
dicky
pilkington
at
such
a
moment
he
could
not
have
done
it
himself
dicky
pilkington
was
the
great
and
mysterious
power
at
the
back
of
but
this
is
the
end
of
it
i
told
him
for
his
future
guidance
and
encouragement
that
he
had
mistaken
cause
and
effect
that
little
variety
like
other
people
are
not
popular
because
they
are
written
about
but
written
about
because
they
are
popular
that
is
the
organ
of
public
opinion
not
of
private
opinions
in
short
that
he
was
in
it
at
all
i
thought
i
sat
on
him
till
he
was
about
flat
and
the
very
next
week
he
comes
bounding
in
with
his
as
he
calls
them
that
was
your
moment
why
did
you
rise
up
in
your
majesty
and
them
could
they
were
too
damned
good
maddox
smiled
at
the
reminiscence
i
was
going
to
let
him
sign
them
but
he
took
the
wind
out
of
my
sails
by
stating
beforehand
that
he
did
want
to
that
if
i
did
mind
if
you
please
he
very
much
rather
not
it
only
the
last
week
when
the
were
getting
better
and
better
that
he
graciously
permitted
his
initials
to
appear
savage
keith
rickman
good
lord
said
rankin
what
must
he
be
like
ask
jewdwine
said
stables
he
jewdwine
man
excuse
said
maddox
he
is
i
say
jewdwine
what
he
like
jewdwine
did
not
respond
very
eagerly
he
wanted
to
get
on
with
his
letter
but
the
club
had
another
unwritten
law
as
to
writing
if
a
majority
of
members
desired
to
write
silence
was
vigorously
insisted
on
any
number
short
of
a
majority
wrote
as
best
they
could
for
this
unfortunate
scribe
there
could
be
no
concession
he
was
in
a
minority
of
one
if
said
he
you
can
imagine
the
soul
of
a
young
sophocles
battling
with
that
of
a
of
a
junior
journalist
in
the
body
of
a
dissipated
little
cockney
ca
said
stables
have
got
enough
imagination
the
child
of
and
of
ollywell
street
innocent
of
er
the
rough
breathing
suggested
maddox
as
it
was
now
seven
and
the
junior
journalists
were
dropping
off
one
by
one
to
the
below
the
young
men
of
began
to
stretch
their
legs
and
raise
their
voices
and
behave
like
young
men
who
believe
their
privacy
to
be
inviolable
and
complete
they
soon
had
the
place
to
themselves
except
for
one
person
whose
entrance
had
been
covered
by
the
outgoing
stream
and
he
had
delicately
turned
his
back
on
them
and
taken
a
seat
in
the
farthest
window
where
his
unobtrusive
presence
could
be
no
possible
hindrance
to
conversation
i
seen
him
after
supper
said
maddox
he
was
obliged
to
speak
rather
loudly
because
of
the
noise
that
came
up
from
the
overcrowded
well
then
how
did
he
strike
you
maddox
eyes
curled
with
limpid
infantile
devilry
well
i
daresay
he
might
be
a
bit
of
a
bounder
when
he
sober
but
he
a
perfect
little
gentleman
when
he
drunk
softens
him
down
somehow
vino
a
true
gentleman
at
heart
one
of
nature
gentlemen
know
said
stables
one
of
art
gentlemen
interposed
jewdwine
severely
and
a
very
fine
gentleman
too
if
you
take
him
that
way
jewdwine
raised
his
head
from
his
letter
and
looked
round
uneasily
personalities
were
not
altogether
to
his
taste
besides
he
was
really
anxious
to
finish
that
letter
he
caught
sight
of
a
back
at
the
other
window
i
think
said
he
quietly
this
conversation
had
better
cease
the
owner
of
the
back
had
moved
a
little
ostentatiously
he
now
got
up
and
crossed
the
room
the
back
was
still
towards
the
group
of
talkers
jewdwine
followed
its
passage
he
was
fascinated
he
gasped
he
could
have
sworn
to
that
back
anywhere
with
its
square
but
slender
shoulders
its
defiant
swing
from
the
straight
hips
the
head
tossed
a
little
backwards
as
if
to
correct
the
student
tendency
to
stoop
he
looked
from
the
back
to
maddox
maddox
could
not
see
what
he
saw
but
his
face
reflected
the
horror
of
jewdwine
their
voices
were
inaudible
enough
now
do
you
know
who
it
is
i
should
think
i
did
it
the
man
himself
how
truly
damnable
said
rankin
after
those
words
there
was
a
silence
which
jewdwine
like
the
wise
man
he
was
utilized
for
his
correspondence
it
was
maddox
who
recovered
first
call
him
what
you
like
said
he
in
a
wonderfully
natural
voice
between
two
puffs
of
a
cigarette
i
consider
him
an
uncommonly
good
sort
a
bit
of
a
bounder
but
no
end
of
a
good
sort
the
others
were
evidently
impressed
by
this
bold
though
desperate
policy
maddox
himself
was
inclined
to
think
that
it
had
saved
the
situation
but
he
was
anxious
to
make
sure
edging
his
chair
by
slow
degrees
he
turned
discreetly
round
with
the
tail
of
his
eye
he
could
see
the
man
himself
standing
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
he
saw
too
that
his
own
effort
though
supreme
had
been
unavailing
it
had
deceived
no
one
least
of
all
the
man
himself
stood
on
the
very
hearth
of
the
club
with
his
back
to
the
fireplace
it
was
the
attitude
of
mastery
a
mastery
the
more
superb
because
unconscious
his
eyes
too
were
the
eyes
of
a
master
twinkling
a
little
as
to
their
light
but
steady
as
to
their
direction
being
fixed
on
maddox
he
was
smiling
there
was
nothing
malignant
or
bitter
or
sardonic
about
that
smile
no
devilry
of
delight
at
their
confusion
no
base
abandonment
of
the
whole
countenance
to
mirth
but
a
curious
smile
implying
delicacies
reservations
a
slow
smile
reminiscent
ruminant
appreciative
it
expressed
if
so
subtle
and
refined
a
thing
could
be
said
to
express
anything
a
certain
exquisite
enjoyment
of
the
phrases
in
which
they
had
defined
him
and
seeing
it
maddox
said
to
himself
he
is
a
gentleman
something
more
in
that
moment
the
celtic
soul
of
maddox
had
recognized
its
master
and
had
sworn
to
him
unhesitating
allegiance
chapter
vi
it
was
not
until
rankin
and
the
others
had
left
the
room
that
jewdwine
had
courage
to
raise
his
head
tentatively
he
had
only
seen
that
young
man
back
and
he
still
clung
to
the
hope
that
it
might
not
be
rickman
after
all
he
looked
up
as
steadily
as
he
dared
oh
no
doubt
that
it
was
rickman
back
no
doubt
too
that
it
was
his
jewdwine
duty
to
go
up
and
speak
to
him
the
young
man
had
changed
his
place
he
was
at
his
window
again
contemplating
as
jewdwine
reflected
with
a
pang
of
sympathy
the
shop
so
profound
so
sacred
almost
was
his
absorption
that
jewdwine
hesitated
in
his
approach
it
rickman
he
asked
still
tentative
mr
jewdwine
rickman
soul
leapt
to
jewdwine
from
the
depths
but
the
mister
marked
the
space
it
had
had
to
travel
when
did
you
come
up
three
hours
ago
he
looks
innocent
said
jewdwine
to
himself
then
you
were
prepared
for
that
jewdwine
followed
his
fascinated
gaze
he
smiled
faintly
you
have
noticed
our
new
departure
we
not
only
purchase
gentlemen
libraries
but
we
sell
the
works
of
persons
who
may
or
may
not
be
gentlemen
jewdwine
felt
profoundly
uncomfortable
rickman
face
preserved
its
inimitable
innocence
but
he
continued
to
stare
fixedly
before
him
poor
fellow
thought
jewdwine
he
must
have
heard
those
imbecilities
he
felt
horribly
responsible
responsible
to
the
club
for
the
behaviour
of
rickman
and
responsible
to
rickman
for
the
behaviour
of
the
club
what
could
he
do
to
make
it
up
to
him
happy
thought
he
would
ask
him
to
dinner
at
yes
at
his
sister
miss
jewdwine
house
at
hampstead
that
was
to
say
if
his
cousin
lucia
harden
did
not
happen
to
be
staying
there
he
was
not
quite
sure
how
rickman
would
strike
that
most
fastidious
of
young
ladies
and
rankin
had
said
he
drank
in
the
light
of
lucia
harden
and
his
sister
possible
criticism
he
considered
him
more
carefully
than
he
had
done
before
the
contrast
between
the
two
men
was
certainly
rather
marked
a
gentleman
can
be
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
gentleman
and
rickman
in
a
sense
not
altogether
intended
by
maddox
was
decidedly
more
his
individuality
was
too
exuberant
too
irrepressible
he
had
the
restless
emphatic
air
of
a
man
who
has
but
little
leisure
and
is
too
obviously
anxious
to
make
the
most
of
what
he
has
he
always
seemed
to
be
talking
against
time
and
as
he
talked
his
emotions
played
visibly
too
visibly
on
his
humorous
irregular
face
taking
into
account
his
remarkable
firmness
of
physique
it
struck
you
that
this
transparency
must
be
due
to
some
excessive
radiance
of
soul
a
soul
in
opinion
a
trifle
too
demonstrative
in
its
hospitality
to
vagrant
impressions
the
junior
journalists
may
have
been
a
little
hard
on
him
on
the
whole
he
left
you
dubious
until
the
moment
when
from
pure
nervousness
his
speech
went
wild
even
suffering
that
slight
elision
of
the
aspirate
observed
by
some
of
them
but
then
he
had
a
voice
of
such
singular
musical
felicity
that
it
charmed
you
into
forgetfulness
of
these
enormities
it
had
charmed
jewdwine
from
the
first
and
jewdwine
was
hard
to
charm
there
was
no
room
for
speculation
as
to
him
even
to
the
eye
his
type
had
none
of
the
uncertainty
and
complexity
of
rickman
he
looked
neither
more
nor
less
than
he
was
an
oxford
don
developing
into
a
london
journalist
you
divined
that
the
process
would
be
slow
there
was
no
unseemly
haste
about
jewdwine
time
had
not
been
spared
in
the
moulding
of
his
body
and
his
soul
he
bore
the
impress
of
the
ages
the
whole
man
was
aristocratic
finished
defined
you
instinctively
looked
up
to
him
which
was
perhaps
the
reason
why
you
remembered
his
conspicuously
intellectual
forehead
and
his
pathetically
fastidious
nose
and
forgot
the
vacillating
mouth
that
drooped
under
a
scanty
colourless
moustache
hiding
its
weakness
out
of
sight
rickman
had
always
looked
up
to
him
for
jewdwine
as
rankin
had
intimated
was
the
man
who
had
discovered
he
was
always
discovering
him
not
as
he
was
careful
to
inform
you
that
this
argued
any
sort
of
intimacy
on
the
contrary
it
meant
that
he
was
always
losing
sight
of
him
in
between
these
lapses
in
their
intercourse
might
be
shorter
or
longer
they
were
frequently
immense
but
they
had
this
advantage
that
each
fresh
encounter
presented
rickman
as
an
entirely
new
thing
if
anything
more
curious
and
interesting
than
on
the
day
three
years
ago
when
he
unearthed
him
from
behind
the
counter
of
a
dingy
bookshop
in
the
city
he
felt
responsible
for
that
too
rickman
was
instantly
aware
that
he
was
under
criticism
but
he
mistook
its
nature
and
its
grounds
do
suppose
said
he
i
ashamed
of
the
shop
it
is
that
i
was
ashamed
of
our
other
place
that
little
rat
in
the
city
jewdwine
shuddered
through
all
his
but
i
ashamed
of
this
gaudy
pink
concern
it
so
brutally
big
it
ca
live
you
know
without
sucking
the
life
out
of
the
little
booksellers
they
may
have
made
a
great
thing
out
of
it
but
they
were
happy
enough
before
we
came
here
i
never
thought
of
it
in
that
light
have
you
i
have
it
was
evident
that
little
rickman
was
deeply
moved
his
sentiments
did
him
credit
and
he
deserved
to
be
asked
to
dinner
at
hampstead
no
no
not
at
hampstead
here
at
the
club
the
club
was
the
proper
thing
a
public
recognition
of
him
was
the
besides
after
all
it
was
the
club
not
jewdwine
that
had
offended
and
it
was
right
that
the
club
should
expiate
its
offence
what
are
you
doing
at
easter
he
asked
rickman
stroked
his
upper
lip
and
smiled
as
if
cherishing
a
joy
as
secret
and
unborn
as
his
moustache
he
recited
a
selection
from
the
tale
of
his
engagements
can
you
dine
with
me
here
on
saturday
you
free
then
did
you
say
rickman
hesitated
that
was
not
what
he
had
said
he
was
anything
but
free
for
was
he
not
engaged
for
that
evening
to
miss
poppy
grace
he
was
pulled
two
ways
a
hard
pull
he
admired
jewdwine
with
simple
fervour
but
he
also
admired
miss
poppy
grace
again
he
shrank
from
mentioning
an
engagement
of
that
sort
to
jewdwine
while
on
the
other
hand
concealment
was
equally
painful
being
foreign
to
his
nature
so
he
flushed
a
little
as
he
replied
thanks
awfully
i
afraid
i
ca
i
booked
that
night
to
poppy
grace
the
flush
deepened
besides
his
natural
sensitiveness
on
the
subject
of
miss
poppy
grace
he
suffered
tortures
not
wholly
sentimental
whenever
he
had
occasion
to
mention
her
by
her
name
poppy
grace
he
felt
that
somehow
it
did
not
give
you
a
very
high
idea
of
the
lady
and
that
in
this
it
did
her
an
injustice
he
could
have
avoided
it
by
referring
to
her
loftily
as
miss
grace
but
this
course
besides
being
unfamiliar
would
have
savoured
somewhat
of
subterfuge
so
he
blurted
it
all
out
with
an
air
of
defiance
as
much
as
to
say
that
when
you
had
called
her
poppy
grace
you
had
said
the
worst
of
her
jewdwine
face
expressed
as
rickman
had
anticipated
an
exquisite
disapproval
his
own
taste
in
women
was
refined
almost
to
nullity
how
a
poet
and
a
scholar
even
if
not
strictly
speaking
a
gentleman
could
care
to
spend
two
minutes
in
the
society
of
poppy
grace
was
incomprehensible
to
jewdwine
i
did
know
you
cultivated
that
sort
of
person
oh
cultivate
her
his
tone
implied
that
the
soil
was
rather
too
light
for
how
long
have
you
known
her
about
six
months
on
and
off
oh
only
on
and
off
on
and
off
the
i
mean
and
that
knowledge
said
rickman
anybody
can
know
them
on
but
it
not
one
man
in
a
thousand
knows
them
off
really
knows
them
i
very
glad
to
hear
it
he
changed
the
subject
in
rickman
the
poet
he
was
deeply
interested
but
at
the
moment
rickman
the
man
inspired
him
with
disgust
jewdwine
had
a
weak
digestion
when
he
sat
at
the
high
table
peering
at
his
sole
and
chicken
with
critical
and
pathetic
twitchings
of
his
fastidious
nose
he
shuddered
at
the
vigorous
animal
appetites
of
undergraduates
in
hall
even
so
he
shrank
now
from
the
coarse
exuberance
of
rickman
youth
when
it
came
to
women
rickman
impossible
now
jewdwine
while
pursuing
an
inner
train
of
thought
that
had
rickman
for
its
subject
was
also
keeping
his
eye
on
a
hansom
and
wondering
whether
he
would
hail
it
and
so
reach
hampstead
in
time
for
dinner
or
whether
he
would
dine
at
the
club
edith
would
be
annoyed
if
he
failed
to
keep
his
appointment
and
the
club
dinners
were
not
good
but
neither
were
edith
moreover
by
dining
at
the
club
for
and
taking
a
twopenny
tram
instead
of
a
cab
he
would
save
one
and
tenpence
and
yet
he
continued
thoughtfully
the
man
who
wrote
in
was
a
poet
or
at
least
he
added
one
seventh
part
a
poet
though
jewdwine
lower
nature
was
preoccupied
the
supreme
critical
faculty
performed
its
functions
with
precision
the
arithmetical
method
was
perhaps
suggested
by
the
other
calculation
he
could
not
be
quite
sure
but
he
believed
he
had
summed
up
savage
rickman
pretty
accurately
thanks
said
rickman
you
got
the
fraction
all
right
anyhow
a
poet
one
day
out
of
seven
the
other
six
days
a
potman
in
an
infernal
stinking
flaring
as
he
looked
up
at
rickman
blazing
with
all
its
lights
he
felt
that
he
had
hit
on
the
satisfying
the
defining
phrase
his
face
expressed
a
wistful
desire
to
confer
further
with
jewdwine
on
this
matter
but
a
certain
delicacy
restrained
him
something
fine
in
jewdwine
nature
something
responded
to
the
mute
appeal
that
said
so
plainly
wo
you
hear
me
i
so
much
to
ask
so
much
to
say
so
many
ideas
and
you
the
only
man
that
can
understand
them
jewdwine
impressed
everybody
himself
included
as
a
person
of
prodigious
understanding
the
question
was
having
understood
rickman
having
discovered
in
him
a
neglected
genius
having
introduced
him
to
the
club
and
asked
him
to
dinner
on
the
strength
of
it
how
much
further
was
he
prepared
to
go
why
provided
he
was
sure
of
the
genius
almost
any
length
short
of
introducing
him
to
the
ladies
of
his
family
but
was
he
sure
savage
rickman
was
young
and
youth
is
deceptive
supposing
he
jewdwine
was
deceived
supposing
the
genius
were
to
elude
him
leaving
him
saddled
with
the
man
what
on
earth
should
he
do
with
him
things
had
been
simpler
in
the
earlier
days
of
their
acquaintance
when
the
counter
stood
between
them
and
formed
a
firm
natural
barrier
to
closer
intercourse
nobody
not
even
jewdwine
knew
what
that
handshake
across
the
counter
had
meant
for
rickman
how
his
soul
had
hungered
and
thirsted
for
jewdwine
society
how
in
the
little
in
the
city
it
had
consumed
itself
with
longing
it
was
his
first
great
passion
a
passion
that
waited
upon
chance
to
be
gratified
for
five
minutes
ten
minutes
at
the
most
once
jewdwine
had
hung
about
the
shop
for
half
an
hour
talking
the
interview
being
broken
by
rickman
incessant
calls
to
the
counter
once
they
had
taken
a
walk
together
down
cheapside
which
from
that
moment
became
a
holy
place
then
came
the
day
when
at
jewdwine
invitation
in
travelled
down
from
london
to
oxford
and
from
oxford
to
harmouth
her
beauty
appealed
to
jewdwine
taste
and
to
the
taste
of
jewdwine
cousin
he
recognized
in
rickman
a
disciple
and
was
instantly
persuaded
of
his
genius
at
one
bound
rickman
had
leapt
the
barrier
of
the
counter
and
here
he
was
enthusiastic
and
devoted
to
be
sure
his
devotion
was
not
fed
largely
upon
praise
for
unlike
the
younger
man
jewdwine
admired
but
sparingly
neither
was
it
tainted
with
any
thought
of
material
advantage
jewdwine
was
very
free
with
his
criticism
and
advice
but
beyond
these
high
intellectual
aids
it
never
occurred
to
rickman
that
he
had
anything
to
gain
by
jewdwine
friendship
discipleship
is
the
purest
of
all
human
relations
jewdwine
divined
this
purity
and
was
touched
by
it
he
prepared
to
accept
a
certain
amount
of
responsibility
he
looked
at
his
watch
he
could
still
get
to
hampstead
by
eight
if
he
took
a
cab
say
twenty
minutes
he
could
spare
him
another
ten
the
junior
journalists
were
coming
back
from
their
dinner
and
the
room
would
soon
be
crowded
he
took
his
disciple
arm
in
a
protecting
manner
and
steered
him
into
a
near
recess
he
felt
that
the
ten
minutes
he
was
about
to
give
him
would
be
decisive
in
the
young
man
career
you
still
got
to
find
your
formula
not
to
have
found
your
formula
he
said
solemnly
is
not
to
have
found
yourself
perhaps
i
have
been
looking
in
very
likely
places
said
rickman
nobly
touched
as
he
always
was
by
the
more
personal
utterances
of
the
master
the
jubilee
variety
theatre
for
instance
do
you
go
there
to
find
the
ideal
or
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitive
actuality
whichever
you
like
to
call
it
its
name
on
the
programme
is
miss
poppy
grace
look
here
rickman
said
jewdwine
gently
when
are
you
going
to
give
up
this
business
which
business
well
at
the
moment
i
referred
to
your
situation
in
the
gin
palace
of
art
i
ca
chuck
it
just
yet
there
my
father
you
see
it
would
spoil
all
his
pleasure
in
that
new
and
mahogany
devilry
excited
about
it
wants
to
make
it
a
big
thing
so
he
puts
a
big
man
into
it
oh
well
i
must
see
him
started
he
spoke
simply
as
of
a
thing
and
indisputable
jewdwine
admired
you
quite
right
you
handicapped
heavily
handicapped
so
for
goodness
sake
do
weight
yourself
any
more
if
you
ca
drop
the
gin
palace
drop
miss
poppy
grace
poppy
grace
she
weighs
about
as
much
as
a
feather
drop
her
drop
her
all
the
same
i
ca
she
would
drop
she
float
do
float
with
her
as
he
rose
he
spoke
slowly
and
impressively
what
you
got
to
do
is
to
pull
yourself
together
you
ca
afford
to
be
dissolute
or
even
dissipated
rickman
looked
hard
at
jewdwine
boots
irreproachable
boots
well
made
well
polished
unspotted
by
the
world
and
the
only
distinguishable
word
in
rickman
answer
was
life
and
as
he
said
life
he
blushed
like
a
girl
when
for
the
first
time
she
says
love
a
blush
of
rapture
and
of
shame
her
young
blood
sensitive
to
the
least
hint
of
apathy
in
her
audience
jewdwine
apathy
was
immense
another
name
for
the
fugitive
actuality
he
said
well
i
afraid
i
have
any
more
time
he
looked
round
the
room
a
little
vaguely
and
as
he
did
so
he
laid
on
the
young
man
shoulder
a
delicate
fastidious
hand
there
are
one
or
two
men
here
i
should
have
liked
to
introduce
you
to
if
i
had
another
night
perhaps
he
piloted
him
downstairs
and
so
out
into
the
strand
good
night
good
night
take
my
advice
and
leave
the
fugitive
actuality
alone
those
were
jewdwine
last
words
spoken
from
the
depths
of
the
hansom
it
carried
him
to
the
classic
heights
of
hampstead
to
the
haunts
of
the
cultivated
the
intellectual
the
refined
rickman
remained
a
moment
his
dreamy
gaze
was
fixed
on
the
massive
pile
before
him
that
rose
solidly
soaring
flaunting
a
brutal
challenge
to
the
tender
april
sky
it
stood
for
the
vast
material
reality
the
whole
of
that
eternal
implacable
power
which
is
at
enmity
with
dreams
which
may
be
conquered
propitiated
absorbed
but
never
annihilated
or
denied
actuality
was
not
fugitive
chapter
vii
perhaps
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
rickman
had
not
yet
found
himself
there
were
as
he
sorrowfully
reflected
so
many
rickmans
there
was
rickman
of
the
front
shop
and
department
known
as
our
mr
rickman
the
shop
was
proud
of
him
his
appearance
was
supposed
to
give
it
a
certain
he
neither
strutted
nor
grovelled
he
moved
about
from
shelf
to
shelf
in
an
scholarly
manner
he
served
you
not
with
obsequiousness
nor
yet
with
condescension
but
with
a
certain
remoteness
and
abstraction
a
noble
apathy
though
a
bookseller
his
literary
conscience
remained
incorruptible
he
would
introduce
you
to
his
favourite
authors
with
a
magnificent
air
while
an
almost
imperceptible
lifting
of
his
eyebrows
as
he
handed
you
favourite
was
a
subtle
criticism
of
your
taste
this
method
of
conducting
business
was
called
keeping
up
the
tone
of
the
establishment
the
appearance
and
disappearance
of
this
person
was
timed
and
regulated
by
circumstances
beyond
his
own
control
so
that
of
necessity
all
the
other
rickmans
were
subject
to
him
for
there
was
rickman
the
student
and
recluse
who
inhabited
the
insides
of
other
men
books
owing
to
his
habitual
converse
with
intellects
greater
really
greater
than
his
own
he
was
an
exceedingly
humble
and
reverent
person
a
high
and
stainless
soul
you
would
never
have
suspected
his
connection
with
rickman
the
junior
journalist
the
obscure
writer
of
brilliant
paragraphs
a
fellow
destitute
of
reverence
and
decency
and
everything
except
consummate
impudence
a
disconcerting
humour
and
a
startling
style
but
he
was
still
more
distantly
related
to
rickman
the
young
man
about
town
and
that
made
four
besides
these
four
there
was
a
fifth
the
serene
and
perfect
intelligence
who
from
some
height
immeasurably
far
above
them
sat
in
judgement
on
them
all
but
for
his
abnormal
sense
of
humour
he
would
have
been
a
rickman
of
the
pure
reason
no
good
at
all
as
it
was
he
occasionally
offered
some
reflection
which
was
enjoyed
but
seldom
acted
upon
and
underneath
these
rickmans
though
inextricably
damnably
one
with
them
was
a
certain
apparently
commonplace
but
amiable
young
man
who
lived
in
a
bloomsbury
and
dropped
his
aitches
this
young
man
was
tender
and
chivalrous
full
of
little
innocent
civilities
to
the
ladies
of
his
he
admired
above
all
things
modesty
in
a
woman
and
somewhere
in
the
dark
and
unexplored
corners
of
his
nature
he
concealed
a
prejudice
in
favour
of
marriage
and
the
sanctities
of
home
that
made
six
and
no
doubt
they
would
have
pulled
together
well
enough
but
the
bother
was
that
any
one
of
them
was
liable
at
any
moment
to
the
visitation
of
the
seventh
rickman
the
genius
there
was
no
telling
whether
he
would
come
in
the
form
of
a
high
god
or
a
demon
a
consolation
or
a
torment
sometimes
he
would
descend
upon
rickman
in
the
department
and
attempt
to
seduce
him
from
his
allegiance
to
the
quarterly
catalogue
or
he
would
take
up
the
poor
journalist
copy
as
it
lay
on
a
table
and
change
it
so
that
its
own
editor
would
know
it
again
and
sometimes
he
would
swoop
down
on
the
little
bookseller
as
he
sat
at
breakfast
on
a
sunday
morning
in
his
nice
frock
coat
and
clean
collar
and
wrap
his
big
flapping
wings
round
him
and
carry
him
off
to
the
place
where
the
divine
ideas
come
from
leaving
a
silent
and
to
all
appearances
idiotic
young
gentleman
in
his
place
or
he
would
sit
down
by
that
young
side
and
shake
him
out
of
his
little
innocences
and
complacencies
and
turn
all
his
little
jokes
into
his
own
incomprehensible
humour
and
then
the
would
look
uncomfortable
and
say
to
itself
that
rickman
had
been
drinking
in
short
it
was
a
very
confusing
state
of
affairs
and
one
that
made
it
almost
impossible
for
rickman
to
establish
his
identity
seven
rickmans
only
think
of
it
and
some
reckon
an
eighth
rickman
drunk
but
this
is
not
altogether
fair
for
intoxication
acted
rather
on
all
seven
at
once
producing
in
them
a
gentle
fusion
with
each
other
and
the
universe
they
had
ceased
to
struggle
but
rickman
was
not
often
drunk
or
at
least
not
nearly
so
often
as
his
friends
supposed
so
it
was
all
very
well
for
jewdwine
who
was
not
so
bewilderingly
constructed
to
talk
about
finding
your
formula
and
pulling
yourself
together
how
rickman
argued
could
you
hope
to
find
the
formula
of
a
fellow
who
could
only
be
expressed
in
fractions
and
vulgar
fractions
too
how
on
earth
could
you
pull
yourself
together
when
nature
had
deliberately
cut
you
into
little
pieces
never
since
poor
orpheus
was
torn
to
tatters
by
the
mænads
was
there
a
poet
so
horribly
subdivided
talk
of
being
dissolute
dissipated
those
adjectives
were
a
poor
description
of
it
was
more
than
sowing
a
mere
handful
of
wild
oats
it
was
a
disintegration
a
scattering
of
rickmans
to
all
the
winds
of
the
world
find
himself
indeed
still
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
try
and
to
that
end
after
dining
with
people
who
were
anything
but
cultivated
or
intellectual
or
refined
he
turned
himself
loose
into
the
streets
the
streets
he
was
never
tired
of
them
after
nine
or
ten
hours
of
sitting
in
a
dusty
bookshop
his
soul
was
dry
with
thirst
for
the
living
world
and
the
young
joy
of
the
world
the
fugitive
actuality
and
her
ways
were
in
the
streets
being
a
young
poet
about
town
he
turned
to
the
streets
as
naturally
as
a
young
poet
in
the
country
turns
to
the
woods
and
fields
for
in
the
streets
if
you
know
how
to
listen
you
can
hear
the
lyric
soul
of
things
as
plainly
more
plainly
perhaps
than
in
the
woods
or
fields
only
it
sings
another
sort
of
song
and
going
into
the
streets
was
rickman
way
the
only
way
open
to
him
as
yet
of
going
into
society
the
doors
were
thrown
hospitably
wide
to
him
one
day
was
as
good
as
another
the
world
was
always
at
home
it
was
a
world
where
he
could
pick
and
choose
his
acquaintance
where
indeed
out
of
that
multitudinous
procession
of
persons
his
power
of
selection
was
unlimited
he
never
had
any
difficulty
with
them
their
methods
were
so
charmingly
simple
and
direct
in
the
streets
the
soul
is
surprised
through
the
lifting
of
an
eyelid
and
the
secret
of
the
heart
sits
lightly
on
the
curl
of
the
lip
these
passers
by
never
wearied
him
they
flung
him
the
flower
of
the
mystery
and
passed
by
the
perfection
of
social
intercourse
he
conceived
as
a
similar
succession
of
radiant
intimacies
he
went
southwards
down
gower
street
drawn
by
the
fugitive
perspective
of
the
lamps
he
went
westwards
down
shaftesbury
avenue
to
piccadilly
the
circus
was
a
gleaming
basin
filled
with
grey
night
clear
as
water
the
floor
of
it
alive
with
lights
lights
that
stood
still
lights
that
wandered
from
darkness
into
darkness
that
met
and
parted
darting
wheeling
and
crossing
in
their
flight
long
avenues
opened
out
of
it
precipitous
deep
cuttings
leading
into
the
night
the
steep
shadowy
masses
of
building
seemed
piled
like
a
city
of
the
air
here
the
gleam
of
some
golden
white
façade
there
some
aerial
battlement
crowned
with
stars
with
clusters
and
points
and
rings
of
flame
that
made
a
lucid
twilight
of
the
dark
above
them
over
all
was
an
illusion
of
immensity
nine
of
an
april
night
the
time
when
a
great
city
has
most
power
over
those
that
love
her
the
time
when
she
lowers
her
voice
and
subdues
her
brilliance
intimating
that
she
is
not
what
she
seems
when
she
makes
herself
unearthly
and
insubstantial
veiling
her
grossness
in
the
night
like
some
consummate
temptress
she
plays
the
mystic
clothing
herself
with
light
and
darkness
skirting
the
intangible
hinting
at
the
infinities
flinging
out
the
eternal
spiritual
lure
so
that
she
may
better
seduce
the
senses
through
the
soul
and
rickman
was
too
young
a
poet
to
distinguish
clearly
between
his
senses
and
his
imagination
or
his
imagination
and
his
soul
he
stood
in
piccadilly
circus
and
regarded
the
spectacle
of
the
night
he
watched
the
groups
gathering
at
the
street
corners
the
boys
that
went
laughing
arm
in
arm
the
young
girls
smiling
into
their
eyes
here
and
there
the
faces
of
other
women
dubious
divinities
of
the
and
the
pavement
passing
and
passing
a
very
ordinary
spectacle
but
to
rickman
it
had
an
immense
significance
a
rhythmic
processional
resonance
and
grandeur
it
was
an
unrhymed
song
out
of
it
was
the
luminous
passionate
nocturne
of
the
streets
nine
a
young
girl
met
him
and
stopped
she
laughed
into
his
face
pretty
well
pleased
with
yourself
are
you
said
the
young
girl
he
laughed
back
again
he
was
pleased
with
the
world
so
of
course
he
was
pleased
with
himself
they
were
one
the
same
spirit
was
in
rickman
that
was
in
the
young
girl
and
in
the
young
april
night
they
walked
together
as
far
as
the
strand
conversing
innocently
chapter
viii
at
ten
he
found
himself
in
a
corridor
of
the
jubilee
variety
theatre
the
young
girl
had
vanished
for
a
moment
he
stood
debating
whether
he
would
go
home
and
work
out
some
ideas
he
had
or
whether
he
would
pursue
the
young
joy
the
fugitive
actuality
to
the
very
threshold
of
the
dawn
whether
in
short
he
would
make
a
night
of
it
he
was
aroused
by
the
sound
of
a
opening
and
shutting
and
a
shining
and
a
shining
face
darted
suddenly
into
the
light
at
the
same
moment
a
voice
hailed
him
hello
razors
that
you
voice
face
and
shining
belonged
to
richard
pilkington
financial
agent
of
shaftesbury
avenue
razors
was
the
name
by
which
rickman
was
known
to
his
intimates
in
subtle
allusion
to
his
youth
he
responded
sulkily
to
the
hail
dicky
pilkington
was
the
last
person
he
desired
to
meet
for
he
owed
dicky
a
certain
sum
not
large
but
larger
than
he
could
conveniently
pay
and
dicky
was
objectionable
for
other
reasons
he
had
mysterious
relations
with
the
management
of
the
jubilee
theatre
and
consequently
unlimited
facilities
of
access
to
miss
poppy
grace
besides
there
was
something
about
him
that
was
deadly
to
ideas
ideas
or
no
ideas
pilkington
was
not
to
be
evaded
he
bore
down
on
rickman
shining
genially
and
addressed
him
with
an
air
of
banter
could
have
arranged
it
better
you
the
very
fellow
i
want
there
was
a
suggestion
of
a
chuckle
in
his
voice
which
sent
thoughts
flying
fearfully
to
his
last
the
alert
mind
of
pilkington
followed
their
flight
he
was
intensely
amused
he
always
was
amused
when
anybody
showed
a
marked
distaste
for
his
society
your
business
not
mine
this
time
rick
i
happen
to
know
of
a
ripping
old
library
for
sale
down
in
devonshire
should
have
thought
of
it
if
i
had
seen
you
well
rickman
face
expressed
an
utter
inability
to
perceive
the
connection
once
the
iron
shutters
had
closed
on
rickman
he
felt
that
he
was
no
more
a
part
of
it
words
could
not
express
his
abhorrence
of
the
indecent
people
who
insisted
on
talking
shop
out
of
shop
hours
and
dicky
never
had
any
decency
well
it
practically
on
our
hands
d
see
and
if
your
people
care
to
take
over
the
whole
lot
i
can
let
you
have
it
pretty
reasonably
rickman
face
emptied
itself
of
all
expression
whatever
i
say
you
are
a
cool
young
cuss
is
this
the
way
you
generally
do
business
i
think
it
over
would
think
too
long
if
i
were
you
it
ought
to
go
by
auction
and
it
might
only
private
contract
preferred
why
preferred
out
of
respect
for
the
feelin
of
the
family
rickman
eyes
were
wandering
dreamily
from
the
matter
in
hand
they
had
alighted
on
an
enormous
photograph
of
miss
poppy
grace
for
an
instant
thought
like
a
cloud
obscured
the
brilliance
of
pilkington
face
anyhow
i
given
you
the
straight
tip
said
pilkington
thanks
we
send
a
fellow
down
to
overhaul
the
thing
he
better
hurry
up
then
it
have
to
go
by
auction
after
all
but
if
you
like
the
refusal
of
it
now
your
chance
but
rickman
betrayed
no
enthusiasm
you
better
see
the
about
it
pilkington
looked
rickman
up
and
down
and
encountered
an
immovable
determination
in
his
gaze
right
you
are
i
send
him
word
he
turned
again
in
the
moment
of
departing
i
say
he
must
send
a
good
man
down
you
know
it
take
an
expert
there
a
lot
of
old
things
greek
and
latin
that
something
in
line
is
it
but
rickman
line
at
present
was
the
line
of
least
resistance
it
was
ten
past
ten
and
poppy
grace
was
on
from
ten
fifteen
to
ten
forty
chapter
ix
she
was
only
an
ordinary
little
variety
actress
and
he
knew
her
little
programme
pretty
well
by
heart
but
her
fascinations
were
independent
of
the
glamour
of
the
it
was
off
the
stage
that
he
had
first
come
to
know
her
really
know
her
a
thing
that
at
the
first
blush
of
it
seems
impossible
for
the
great
goddess
diana
is
not
more
divinely
secret
and
secluded
than
to
a
young
bookseller
a
popular
dance
and
song
artiste
in
private
life
poppy
rooms
were
next
door
to
the
balcony
and
it
was
the
balcony
that
did
it
now
in
the
matter
of
balconies
if
you
choose
to
regard
the
receding
wooden
partition
as
a
partition
and
sit
very
far
back
behind
it
you
will
have
your
balcony
all
to
yourself
that
is
to
say
you
will
see
nothing
neither
will
you
be
seen
if
however
you
prefer
as
rickman
preferred
to
lean
forward
over
the
railings
and
observe
things
passing
in
the
street
below
you
can
hardly
help
establishing
some
sort
of
communication
with
the
neighbour
who
happens
to
be
doing
the
same
thing
at
first
this
communication
was
purely
in
the
region
of
the
mind
without
so
much
as
the
movement
of
an
eyelid
on
either
side
and
that
made
it
all
the
more
intimate
and
intense
but
to
sit
there
sunday
evening
after
sunday
evening
when
the
other
boarders
were
at
church
both
looking
at
the
same
opposite
or
the
same
of
a
sunset
flung
across
the
chimney
pots
without
uttering
a
syllable
or
a
sound
was
at
last
seen
by
both
in
its
true
light
as
a
thing
not
only
painful
but
absurd
so
one
evening
the
deep
silence
burst
and
flowered
into
speech
in
common
courtesy
rickman
had
to
open
his
lips
to
ask
her
whether
she
objected
to
his
smoking
she
did
not
then
it
came
to
acknowledging
each
other
in
the
streets
after
that
to
poppy
coming
out
and
looking
over
the
balcony
about
the
time
when
rickman
would
be
coming
home
from
the
shop
and
to
rickman
looking
to
see
if
poppy
was
looking
and
so
on
to
that
wonderful
night
when
he
saw
her
home
from
the
jubilee
theatre
the
stars
were
out
not
that
poppy
cared
a
rap
about
the
stars
her
first
appearance
was
in
the
character
of
a
a
part
well
suited
to
her
audacity
and
impertinent
prettiness
poppy
was
the
tiniest
dancer
that
ever
whirled
across
a
stage
a
circumstance
that
somewhat
diminished
the
vulgarity
of
her
impersonation
while
it
gave
it
a
very
engaging
character
of
its
own
her
small
cockney
face
with
its
impudent
laughing
nose
its
curling
mouth
none
too
small
its
big
twinkling
blue
eyes
was
framed
in
a
golden
fringe
and
side
curls
she
wore
a
purple
velveteen
skirt
a
purple
velveteen
jacket
with
a
large
lace
collar
and
a
still
larger
purple
velveteen
hat
with
white
ostrich
feathers
that
swayed
madly
from
the
perpendicular
the
secret
of
poppy
popularity
lay
in
this
that
you
could
always
depend
on
her
she
always
played
the
same
part
in
the
same
manner
but
her
manner
was
her
own
to
come
on
the
stage
quietly
to
look
in
spite
of
her
coster
costume
the
picture
of
suburban
innocence
and
pink
and
white
propriety
to
stand
facing
her
audience
for
a
second
of
time
motionless
and
in
perfect
gravity
it
was
a
trick
that
though
poppy
never
varied
it
had
a
more
killing
effect
than
the
most
ingenious
impromptu
sh
sh
sh
sh
a
flutter
of
programmes
in
the
pit
was
indignantly
suppressed
by
the
gallery
there
was
a
movement
of
poppy
right
eyelid
which
in
a
larger
woman
would
have
been
called
a
wink
in
poppy
it
appeared
as
an
exaggerated
twinkle
it
was
greeted
with
a
roar
of
rapturous
applause
then
poppy
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
and
her
head
on
one
side
raised
her
cockney
voice
in
a
song
executing
between
each
verse
a
slow
swinging
chassée
to
the
stage
humorist
with
the
concertina
oh
she
my
fancy
girl
with
all
outer
curl
orf
eyes
orf
petticoats
all
awry
for
then
she
is
shy
she
gives
bangs
a
twirl
and
it
me
quick
and
the
trick
and
yer
like
to
try
when
the
stage
humorist
with
the
concertina
stopped
chasséeing
and
put
his
finger
to
his
nose
and
observed
that
wot
you
might
call
a
dim
innuender
rickman
could
have
kicked
him
got
up
fit
ter
kill
in
velverteen
an
frill
it
orf
orf
yer
one
in
the
heye
a
strollin
down
the
with
alf
an
bill
it
er
that
and
my
and
yer
like
to
try
to
try
to
try
her
chassée
quickened
ever
so
little
doubled
on
itself
and
became
a
tortuous
thing
poppy
feet
beat
out
the
measure
that
is
danced
on
east
end
pavements
to
the
music
of
the
concertina
in
the
very
abandonment
of
burlesque
poppy
remained
an
artist
and
her
dance
preserved
the
gravity
of
the
original
ballet
designed
for
performance
on
a
flagstone
now
it
unfolded
it
burst
its
bounds
it
was
a
rhythmic
stampede
louder
and
louder
her
clicking
heels
beat
the
furious
time
higher
and
higher
her
dexterous
toes
flew
to
her
feathers
that
bowed
to
meet
them
and
when
her
last
superhuman
kick
sent
her
hat
flying
and
the
humorist
caught
it
on
his
head
they
had
brought
the
house
down
rickman
went
out
to
the
bar
where
he
found
dicky
pilkington
and
at
dicky
suggestion
he
endeavoured
to
quench
with
brandy
and
soda
his
inextinguishable
thirst
he
returned
to
the
storm
and
glare
of
the
ballet
the
last
appearance
of
that
small
incarnate
genius
of
folly
there
were
other
dancers
but
he
saw
none
but
her
he
knew
every
pose
and
movement
of
her
body
from
her
first
tentative
preluding
pirouette
to
her
last
dance
when
she
tossed
her
tall
grenadier
cap
to
the
back
of
the
stage
and
still
spinning
shook
out
her
hair
and
flung
herself
backwards
till
it
streamed
and
eddied
with
the
whirlwind
of
her
dance
in
her
fantastic
dress
she
wore
her
colours
the
red
and
black
her
very
womanhood
had
vanished
she
was
a
mere
insignificant
morsel
of
flesh
and
blood
inspired
by
the
dizzy
reckless
fury
of
the
there
was
a
noise
of
many
boots
beating
the
floor
of
the
house
it
grew
into
a
thick
solid
body
of
sound
torn
at
intervals
by
a
screaming
whistle
from
the
galleries
someone
up
there
shouted
her
name
poppy
poppy
grace
and
rickman
shivered
to
rickman
mind
the
name
was
an
outrage
it
reeked
of
popularity
it
suggested
absurdly
and
abominably
a
certain
cheap
drink
of
sudden
and
ephemeral
effervescence
he
never
let
his
mind
dwell
on
those
dreadful
syllables
any
longer
than
he
could
help
he
never
thought
of
her
as
poppy
grace
at
all
he
thought
of
her
in
undefined
extraordinary
ways
now
as
some
nameless
aerial
spirit
unaccountably
wandering
about
in
a
world
too
gross
for
it
and
now
as
the
young
joy
the
fugitive
actuality
after
brandy
and
soda
his
imagination
possessed
itself
of
poppy
and
wove
round
her
the
glory
and
gloom
of
the
world
it
saw
in
her
not
the
incarnation
of
the
rosy
moment
but
the
eternal
sacrifice
of
woman
the
tragedy
of
her
abasement
her
obedience
to
the
world
which
when
he
came
to
think
of
it
was
really
very
clever
of
his
imagination
meanwhile
poppy
was
behaving
as
she
had
behaved
for
the
last
fifty
nights
like
a
lunatic
humming
top
now
it
had
steadied
itself
in
the
intensity
of
its
speed
the
little
was
sleeping
poppy
as
she
span
seemed
to
be
standing
her
feet
rooted
her
body
swaying
delicately
from
the
hips
like
a
flower
rocked
by
the
wind
the
light
of
her
flickering
flamewise
there
was
a
stir
a
wave
as
if
the
heart
of
the
house
had
heaved
pit
and
gallery
breathed
hard
rickman
leaned
forward
with
clouded
eyes
and
troubled
forehead
while
the
young
the
other
young
thrilled
with
familiar
and
delicious
emotion
now
she
curtsied
as
she
had
curtsied
for
the
last
fifty
nights
bowing
lower
and
lower
till
her
hair
fell
over
her
face
and
swept
the
stage
and
now
she
shook
her
head
till
the
great
golden
whorl
of
hair
seemed
the
only
part
of
her
left
spinning
then
poppy
folded
her
arms
and
sank
sank
till
she
sat
on
her
heels
herself
invisible
curtained
in
modest
and
mystic
fashion
by
her
hair
bravo
bravo
that
the
trick
encore
oh
my
fancy
girl
it
was
all
over
chapter

he
hurried
back
to
bloomsbury
in
the
wake
of
her
hansom
to
the
house
of
the
balcony
opposite
the
the
was
into
the
night
but
the
balcony
hung
out
black
in
the
yellow
light
from
its
three
long
windows
poppy
was
not
in
the
balcony
he
went
up
into
the
room
where
the
light
was
a
room
that
had
been
once
an
ordinary
bloomsbury
the
of
propriety
now
it
was
poppy
you
came
straight
out
of
a
desert
of
dreary
and
obscure
respectability
and
it
burst
it
blossomed
into
poppy
before
your
eyes
portraits
of
poppy
on
the
walls
in
every
conceivable
and
inconceivable
attitude
poppy
canary
in
the
window
in
a
cage
hung
with
yellow
gauze
poppy
mandoline
in
an
easy
chair
by
itself
poppy
hat
on
the
grand
piano
tumbling
head
over
heels
among
a
litter
of
coffee
cups
on
the
a
pair
of
shoes
that
could
have
belonged
to
nobody
but
poppy
they
were
so
diminutive
in
the
waste
paper
basket
a
bouquet
that
must
have
been
poppy
too
it
was
so
enormous
and
on
the
table
in
the
window
a
japanese
that
served
as
a
handy
receptacle
for
cigarette
ash
and
spent
vestas
two
immense
mirrors
facing
each
other
reflected
these
objects
and
poppy
when
she
was
there
for
ever
and
ever
in
diminishing
perspective
but
poppy
was
not
there
passing
through
this
brilliant
scene
into
the
back
room
beyond
he
found
her
finishing
her
supper
poppy
was
not
at
all
surprised
to
see
him
she
addressed
him
as
rickets
and
invited
him
under
that
name
to
sit
down
and
have
some
supper
too
but
rickets
did
not
want
any
supper
he
sat
down
at
the
clear
end
of
the
table
and
looked
on
as
in
a
dream
and
when
poppy
had
finished
she
came
and
sat
by
him
on
the
clear
end
of
the
table
and
made
cigarettes
and
drank
champagne
out
of
a
little
tumbler
thought
you
might
feel
a
little
lonely
over
there
said
she
poppy
was
in
spirits
if
she
had
yielded
to
the
glad
impulse
of
her
heart
she
would
have
stood
on
one
foot
and
twirled
the
other
over
head
but
she
restrained
herself
somehow
before
poppy
never
played
any
of
those
tricks
that
delighted
pilkington
and
other
gentlemen
of
her
acquaintance
she
merely
sat
on
the
table
she
was
in
her
and
before
sitting
on
the
table
she
arranged
her
red
skirts
over
her
black
legs
with
a
prodigious
air
of
propriety
poppy
herself
did
not
know
whether
this
meant
that
she
wanted
to
think
her
nice
or
whether
she
wanted
to
think
nice
after
all
it
came
to
the
same
thing
for
to
poppy
the
peculiar
charm
of
was
his
innocence
the
clock
on
pancras
church
struck
eleven
in
his
hanging
cage
in
the
front
room
behind
his
yellow
gauze
curtain
poppy
canary
woke
out
of
his
first
sleep
he
untucked
his
head
from
under
his
wing
and
chirrupped
drowsily
oh
dicky
said
poppy
it
time
you
were
in
your
little
bed
he
did
not
take
the
hint
he
was
intent
on
certain
movements
of
poppy
fingers
and
the
tip
of
her
tongue
concerned
in
the
making
of
cigarettes
he
was
gazing
into
her
face
as
if
it
held
for
him
the
secret
of
the
world
and
that
look
embarrassed
her
it
had
all
the
assurance
of
age
and
all
the
wonder
of
youth
in
it
poppy
eyes
were
trained
to
look
out
for
danger
signals
in
the
eyes
of
boys
for
poppy
according
to
those
lights
of
hers
was
honest
if
she
knew
the
secret
of
the
world
she
would
not
have
told
it
to
he
was
much
too
young
men
in
poppy
code
of
morality
were
different
but
this
amazing
dreamy
interrogative
look
was
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
poppy
was
accustomed
to
and
for
once
in
her
life
poppy
felt
shy
i
say
rickets
there
goes
a
quarter
to
twelve
i
wake
him
out
of
his
little
sleep
poppy
talked
as
much
to
the
canary
as
to
rickets
which
made
it
all
quite
proper
as
for
rickman
he
talked
hardly
at
all
you
have
to
go
in
ten
minutes
rick
and
by
way
of
softening
this
announcement
she
gave
him
some
champagne
he
had
paid
no
attention
to
that
hint
either
being
occupied
with
a
curious
phenomenon
though
poppy
was
for
her
most
unusually
stationary
he
found
that
it
was
making
him
slightly
giddy
to
look
at
her
he
was
arriving
at
that
moment
of
intoxication
when
things
lose
their
baldness
and
immobility
and
the
world
begins
to
float
like
an
enchanted
island
in
a
beautiful
haze
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
than
the
first
approaches
of
this
blessed
state
he
encouraged
it
anticipating
with
ecstasy
each
stage
in
the
mounting
of
the
illusion
for
when
he
was
sober
he
saw
poppy
very
much
as
she
was
but
when
he
was
drunk
she
became
for
him
a
being
immaculate
divine
he
moved
in
a
region
of
gross
but
glorious
exaggeration
where
his
wretched
little
cockney
passion
assumed
the
proportions
of
a
superb
romance
his
soul
that
minute
was
the
home
of
the
purest
most
exalted
emotions
yes
he
could
certainly
feel
it
coming
on
poppy
face
was
growing
bigger
and
bigger
opening
out
and
blossoming
like
an
enormous
flower
nine
minutes
up
in
another
minute
you
go
it
seemed
to
him
that
poppy
was
measuring
time
by
pouring
champagne
into
little
tumblers
and
that
she
gave
him
champagne
to
drink
he
knew
it
was
no
use
drinking
it
for
that
thirst
of
his
was
unquenchable
but
he
drank
for
the
sake
of
the
illusion
and
as
he
drank
it
seemed
to
him
that
not
only
was
poppy
worthy
of
all
adoration
but
that
his
passion
for
her
was
no
mere
vulgar
and
earthly
passion
it
was
a
glorious
and
immortal
thing
poppy
looked
at
him
curiously
she
was
the
soul
of
hospitality
but
it
struck
her
that
she
was
being
a
little
too
liberal
with
the
champagne
no
razors
no
more
fizz
if
i
were
to
drink
a
drop
more
it
would
spoil
my
little
dance
that
always
fetches
the
boys
she
turned
her
tumbler
upside
down
in
token
of
renunciation
and
led
the
way
into
the
front
room
he
followed
her
with
enchanted
feet
he
was
now
moving
as
in
an
arabian
night
dream
in
the
front
room
was
a
sofa
no
a
divan
and
on
the
divan
the
skin
of
a
polar
bear
sprawling
rickman
and
poppy
sat
on
the
top
of
the
bear
such
a
disreputable
cosmopolitan
bear
his
little
were
screwed
up
in
a
wicked
wink
a
wink
that
repudiated
any
connection
with
his
native
waters
of
the
pole
the
house
was
very
still
behind
his
yellow
gauze
curtain
the
canary
stirred
in
his
sleep
he
murmured
plaintively
in
his
dream
dicky
echoed
poppy
then
because
she
had
nothing
to
say
she
began
to
sing
she
sang
the
song
of
simpson
the
tenor
simpson
the
master
of
tears
was
on
the
night
our
little
byby
died
and
bill
comes
and
sez
ere
i
signed
a
pledge
the
beer
d
see
sez
wot
i
ter

tittervyte
bloomin
little
gryve
then
well
yo
should
us
we
cried
like
bloomin
kids
the
night
the
byby
died
that
song
said
poppy
does
exactly
suit
my
style
of
beauty
you
should
have
heard
simpey
sing
it
given
you
something
to
for
for
rickman
looked
depressed
the
sound
of
poppy
song
waked
the
canary
he
fluttered
down
from
his
perch
and
stretched
his
wings
trailing
them
on
the
floor
of
his
cage
to
brush
the
sleep
out
of
them
did
you
ever
see
such
affectation
said
poppy
look
at
him
striking
attitudes
up
there
all
by
little
self
poppy
seemed
to
cling
to
the
idea
of
the
canary
as
a
symbol
of
propriety
do
you
know
rickets
it
past
twelve
no
he
did
know
he
had
taken
no
count
of
time
but
he
knew
that
he
had
drunk
a
great
many
little
tumblers
of
champagne
and
that
his
love
for
poppy
seemed
more
than
ever
a
supersensuous
and
immortal
thing
he
pulled
himself
together
in
order
to
tell
her
so
but
at
that
moment
he
was
confronted
by
an
insuperable
difficulty
in
the
tender
and
passionate
speech
that
he
was
about
to
make
to
her
it
would
be
necessary
to
address
her
by
name
but
how
in
heaven
name
could
he
address
a
divinity
as
poppy
he
settled
the
difficulty
by
deciding
that
he
would
not
address
her
at
all
there
should
be
no
invocation
he
would
simply
explain
he
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room
and
explained
in
such
words
as
pleased
him
the
distinction
between
the
corruptible
and
the
incorruptible
eros
from
time
to
time
he
chanted
his
own
poems
in
the
intervals
of
explaining
for
they
bore
upon
the
matter
in
hand
rickets
said
poppy
severely
you
had
too
much
fizz
i
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
most
unmistakably
i
know
it
is
very
nice
of
me
to
say
so
when
it
my
fizz
you
been
drinking
but
it
is
really
mine
it
dicky
pilkington
at
least
he
paid
for
it
but
rickets
did
not
hear
her
his
soul
soaring
on
wings
of
champagne
was
borne
far
away
from
dicky
pilkington
know
chanted
rickets
that
the
love
which
is
my
lord
most
high
he
changeth
not
with
seasons
and
with
days
his
feet
are
shod
with
light
in
all
his
ways
and
when
he
followeth
none
have
power
to
fly
he
chooseth
whom
he
will
and
draweth
nigh
to
them
alone
whom
he
himself
doth
raise
unto
his
perfect
service
and
his
praise
of
such
love
lowliest
minister
am
i
if
you
asked
me
said
poppy
i
should
have
said
he
had
a
pretty
good
opinion
of
himself
what
do
you
say
dicky
sweet
sang
the
canary
in
one
pure
penetrating
note
the
voice
of
innocence
itself
is
he
rakish
but
poppy
got
no
answer
from
the
sonneteer
he
had
wheeled
round
from
her
carried
away
in
the
triumph
and
rapture
of
the
sestette
his
steps
marked
the
beat
of
the
iambics
he
turned
on
his
heel
at
the
end
of
every
line
for
the
moment
he
was
sober
as
men
count
sobriety
for
he
i
serve
hath
paced
heaven
golden
floor
and
chanted
with
the
seraphims
glad
choir
lo
all
his
wings
are
plumed
with
fervent
fire
he
hath
twain
that
bear
him
upward
evermore
with
twain
he
veils
his
holy
eyes
before
the
mystery
of
his
own
divine
desire
does
it
remind
you
of
anything
he
asked
it
struck
her
as
odd
that
he
seemed
to
realize
her
presence
with
difficulty
no
i
ca
say
that
i
ever
heard
anything
like
it
in
my
life
well
the
idea
bagged
from
dante
i
mean
but
he
does
want
it
as
badly
as
i
do
in
fac
i
don
think
he
wants
it
at
all
where
he
is
now
if
he
does
he
can
take
any
of
mine
in
exchange
you
bear
me
out
poppy
i
invite
the
gentleman
to
step
down
and
make
own
nobody
can
say
i
plagiarize
anyborry
anyborry
but
myself
all
right
do
you
worry
old
chappy
said
poppy
soothingly
you
come
here
and
sit
quiet
he
came
and
sat
down
beside
her
as
if
the
evening
had
only
just
begun
he
sat
down
carefully
tenderly
lest
he
should
crush
so
much
as
the
hem
of
her
diaphanous
skirts
and
then
he
began
to
talk
to
her
he
said
there
was
no
woman
no
lady
in
the
world
for
whom
he
felt
such
reverence
and
admiration
he
said
you
fit
to
dance
before
god
on
the
floor
of
heaven
when
they
swept
it
oh
come
said
poppy
ca
you
go
one
better
he
could
he
did
he
intimated
that
though
he
worshipped
every
hair
of
poppy
little
head
and
every
inch
of
poppy
little
body
what
held
him
at
the
moment
were
the
fascinations
of
her
mind
and
the
positively
gorgeous
beauty
of
her
soul
yes
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
object
of
his
devotion
was
poppy
imperishable
soul
well
said
poppy
that
tykes
the
very
macaroon
then
she
laughed
she
laughed
as
if
she
would
never
have
done
she
laughed
first
with
her
eyes
then
with
her
throat
then
with
her
whole
body
shaking
her
head
and
rocking
herself
backwards
and
forwards
she
laughed
till
her
hair
came
down
and
he
took
it
and
smoothed
it
into
two
sleek
straight
bands
and
tied
them
in
a
loose
knot
under
her
chin
then
she
stopped
laughing
her
face
between
the
two
tight
sheaths
of
hair
seemed
to
close
and
shrink
to
a
thin
sharp
bud
it
closed
and
opened
again
it
grew
nearer
and
bigger
it
bent
forward
and
put
out
its
mouth
for
it
had
a
mouth
this
extraordinary
flower
and
kissed
him
i
sy
it
nearly
one
said
she
you
got
to
clear
out
of
this
come
she
rose
she
stood
before
him
holding
out
her
hands
to
help
him
to
get
up
and
go
she
laughed
again
she
laughed
her
head
flung
back
her
face
foreshortened
her
white
throat
swelled
and
quivering
the
abandoned
figure
of
low
comedy
incarnate
but
that
was
not
what
he
saw
to
him
it
was
as
if
the
dark
impenetrable
world
had
suddenly
unfolded
had
blossomed
and
flowered
in
the
rose
of
her
mouth
as
if
all
the
roses
of
all
the
world
went
to
make
up
the
petals
of
that
rose
her
body
was
nothing
but
a
shining
transparent
vessel
for
the
fire
of
life
it
ran
over
it
leapt
from
her
the
hands
she
stretched
out
to
him
were
two
shallow
lamps
that
could
hardly
hold
the
tall
upward
shooting
splendour
of
the
flame
he
rose
unsteadily
to
his
feet
the
movement
being
somewhat
complicated
brought
him
within
a
yard
of
his
own
figure
as
presented
in
one
of
the
long
mirrors
he
stood
there
arrested
fascinated
shocked
by
that
person
in
the
mirror
the
face
he
was
accustomed
to
see
in
mirrors
was
grave
and
not
high
coloured
and
it
always
kept
its
mouth
shut
this
person
face
was
very
red
and
his
mouth
was
slightly
open
a
detail
he
noticed
with
a
peculiar
disgust
he
could
not
get
away
from
it
either
it
was
held
there
illuminated
insisted
on
repeated
for
ever
and
ever
smaller
and
smaller
an
endless
procession
of
faces
all
animated
by
one
frenzy
and
one
flame
he
was
appalled
by
this
mysterious
multiplication
of
his
person
and
by
the
flushed
and
brilliant
infamy
of
his
face
the
face
was
the
worst
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
anything
so
detestable
as
the
face
he
sat
down
and
hid
it
in
his
hands
poor
rickets
said
poppy
softly
she
drew
his
hands
from
his
face
by
a
finger
at
a
time
oh
you
are
such
a
rum
little
fellow
i
suppose
why
i
like
you
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
think
why
i
kissed
you
unless
it
was
to
say
a
kiss
more
or
less
was
nothing
to
poppy
and
that
one
she
felt
had
been
valedictory
she
had
kissed
not
but
his
dying
innocence
the
boy
in
him
and
she
had
really
wanted
him
to
go
the
house
was
stiller
than
ever
the
canary
had
tucked
his
head
under
his
wing
and
gone
to
sleep
again
out
of
the
silence
the
clock
of
pancras
church
struck
one
and
yet
he
had
not
gone
chapter
xi
a
step
was
heard
on
the
pavement
outside
then
the
click
of
a
a
step
on
the
stairs
at
the
threshold
and
pilkington
walked
in
with
the
air
of
being
the
master
of
the
house
and
everything
in
it
the
little
laughing
mask
slipped
from
poppy
face
her
eyes
were
two
sapphire
crescents
darting
fright
under
lids
there
was
a
look
in
dicky
face
she
did
not
care
for
but
rickman
as
maddox
had
testified
was
a
perfect
little
gentleman
when
he
was
drunk
and
at
the
sight
of
pilkington
chivalry
immortal
chivalry
leapt
in
his
heart
he
became
suddenly
grave
steady
and
coherent
i
was
just
going
miss
grace
but
if
you
want
me
to
stay
a
little
longer
i
stay
you
better
said
miss
grace
her
eyes
followed
him
sullenly
as
he
went
so
did
pilkington
well
she
said
i
suppose
that
what
you
wanted
yes
but
there
no
good
overdoing
the
thing
you
know
this
said
pilkington
is
a
damned
sight
too
expensive
game
for
him
to
play
he
all
right
it
was
his
fault
i
let
him
drink
too
much
champagne
what
did
you
do
that
for
could
you
see
he
had
enough
already
how
was
i
to
know
he
nicer
when
he
drunk
than
other
people
are
when
they
sober
he
looked
at
her
critically
i
know
all
about
him
what
i
like
to
know
is
what
you
see
in
him
poppy
returned
his
look
with
interest
coarseness
in
dicky
pilkington
eyes
sat
brilliant
and
unashamed
would
you
so
would
it
wot
i
do
see
in
him
now
subtlety
was
the
last
thing
dicky
expected
from
poppy
and
it
aroused
suspicion
whatever
poppy
instructions
were
she
had
evidently
exceeded
them
poppy
read
his
thoughts
with
accuracy
i
only
did
what
you
told
me
if
you
do
like
it
you
can
finish
the
job
yourself
i
tired
said
poppy
wearily
coiling
up
her
hair
she
was
no
longer
in
spirits
chapter
xii
a
tiny
jet
of
gas
made
a
glimmer
in
the
of
next
door
downey
kept
it
burning
there
for
rickman
guided
by
this
beacon
he
reached
his
door
escaping
many
dangers
for
the
curbstone
was
a
rocking
precipice
and
the
street
below
it
a
grey
and
shimmering
stream
that
rolled
and
flowed
and
rolled
and
never
rested
the
houses
too
were
so
drunk
as
to
be
dangerous
they
bowed
over
him
swaying
hideously
from
their
foundations
they
seemed
to
be
attracted
just
as
he
was
by
that
abominable
slimy
flow
and
glister
of
the
asphalt
another
wriggle
of
the
and
they
would
be
over
on
the
top
of
him
he
approached
his
bedroom
candle
with
infinite
precaution
he
had
tried
to
effect
a
noiseless
entry
but
every
match
as
it
spurted
and
went
out
was
a
little
fiendish
tongue
betraying
him
from
behind
a
bedroom
door
ajar
at
the
dark
end
of
the
passage
the
voice
of
downey
gently
reminded
him
not
to
forget
to
turn
the
gas
out
there
was
a
bright
clear
space
in
his
brain
which
champagne
had
not
penetrated
so
intolerably
clear
and
bright
that
it
hurt
him
to
look
at
it
in
that
space
three
figures
reeled
and
whirled
three
yet
one
and
the
same
poppy
of
the
poppy
of
the
lunatic
ballet
and
poppy
of
the
arabian
night
beyond
the
bright
space
and
the
figures
there
was
a
dark
place
that
was
somehow
curtained
off
something
had
happened
there
he
could
not
see
what
and
in
trying
to
see
he
forgot
to
turn
the
gas
out
he
turned
it
up
instead
he
left
it
blazing
away
at
the
rate
of
a
penny
an
hour
a
witness
against
him
in
the
face
of
morning
but
he
did
not
forget
to
sit
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
and
take
his
boots
off
lest
he
should
wake
flossie
walker
the
little
clerk
who
worked
so
hard
and
had
to
be
up
so
early
he
left
them
on
the
stairs
where
flossie
tripped
over
them
in
the
morning
on
the
first
landing
a
young
man
in
a
frowsy
sleeping
suit
stood
waiting
for
him
a
fresh
sober
and
thoroughly
young
man
gurra
bed
spinks
said
rickman
severely
to
the
young
man
all
right
old
man
spinks
lowered
his
voice
to
a
discreet
whisper
i
say
do
you
want
me
to
help
you
find
your
legs
wish
you
fin
any
par
of
me
that
is
n
legs
said
rickman
and
he
went
on
to
explain
and
to
demonstrate
to
spinks
the
resemblance
amounting
to
identity
between
himself
and
the
manx
arms
three
legs
rampant
on
the
bend
proper
amazin
is
it
it
amazin
feigning
surprise
and
interest
spinks
relieved
him
of
his
candle
and
under
that
escort
rickman
managed
to
attain
to
the
second
floor
rickman
room
was
bared
to
the
glimmer
of
a
lamp
in
the
street
below
he
plunged
and
stumbled
through
a
litter
of
books
the
glimmer
fell
on
the
books
on
many
books
books
that
covered
three
walls
from
floor
to
ceiling
books
ranged
above
and
beside
the
little
in
the
corner
books
piled
on
the
table
and
under
it
the
glimmer
fell
too
on
the
reflected
from
the
glass
above
it
right
on
to
the
white
statuette
of
the
venus
of
milo
that
supported
a
photograph
of
a
dancing
poppy
poppy
who
laughed
in
the
face
of
the
goddess
with
insatiable
impudence
and
flung
to
the
immortal
forehead
the
flick
of
her
shameless
foot
white
and
austere
gleamed
the
venus
if
venus
she
be
for
some
say
she
is
a
wingless
victory
and
rickman
when
sober
inclined
to
that
opinion
white
and
austere
gleamed
the
little
in
the
corner
he
ignored
spinks
discreet
suggestion
he
was
going
to
undress
to
please
spinks
or
anybody
he
see
spinks
in
another
world
first
he
was
going
to
bed
like
a
potman
he
was
going
to
sit
up
like
a
poet
and
write
that
what
he
was
going
to
do
this
was
his
study
with
shaking
hands
he
lit
the
lamp
on
his
study
table
the
wick
sputtered
and
the
light
in
his
head
jigged
horribly
with
the
jigging
of
the
flame
it
was
as
if
he
was
being
stabbed
with
little
knives
of
light
he
plunged
his
head
into
a
basin
of
cold
water
threw
open
his
window
and
leaned
out
into
the
pure
regenerating
night
spinks
sat
down
on
a
chair
and
watched
him
his
fresh
handsome
face
clouded
with
anxiety
he
adored
rickman
sober
but
for
rickman
drunk
he
had
a
curious
yearning
affection
if
anything
he
preferred
him
in
that
state
it
seemed
to
bring
him
nearer
to
him
spinks
had
never
been
drunk
in
his
life
but
that
was
his
feeling
rickman
laid
his
arms
upon
the
window
sill
and
his
head
upon
his
arms
blessed
damozel
leaned
out
he
said
the
idea
in
his
mind
being
that
was
a
blessed
damozel
the
gold
bar
of
heaven
never
knew
they
had
up
there
murmured
spinks
eyes
were
deeper
than
the
depth
of
waters
stilled
at
even
oh
my
god
a
great
sigh
shook
him
and
went
shuddering
into
the
night
like
the
passing
of
a
lost
soul
he
got
up
and
staggered
to
the
table
and
grasped
it
by
the
edge
nearly
upsetting
the
lamp
the
flare
in
his
brain
had
died
down
as
the
lamp
burnt
steadily
under
its
shade
a
round
of
light
fell
on
his
euripides
open
at
the
page
he
had
been
reading
the
night
before
greek
elenê
he
saw
it
very
black
with
the
edges
a
little
wavering
a
little
blurred
as
if
it
had
been
burnt
by
fire
into
the
whiteness
of
the
page
below
the
smaller
type
of
a
chorus
reeled
and
shook
through
all
its
lines
set
up
by
an
intoxicated
compositor
under
the
euripides
was
the
piled
up
manuscript
of
rickman
great
drama
in
he
implored
spinks
to
read
it
spinks
was
a
draper
assistant
and
uncultured
he
thrust
the
manuscript
into
his
hands
there
he
said
rea
that
tha
the
sor
o
thing
i
write
when
drunk
couldn
do
it
now
t
save
my
life
been
ruin
he
threw
himself
on
his
bed
it
all
righ
at
nine
morning
no
at
a
pas
nine
i
mean
three
pas
nine
i
shall
be
drunk
not
disgustingly
and
ridicklelously
as
you
are
spinky
at
this
minute
but
loominously
divinely
drunk
you
don
know
what
i
could
do
if
i
was
only
drunk
oh
come
i
should
complain
if
i
was
you
you
do
pretty
well
as
you
are
i
think
with
an
almost
maternal
tenderness
and
tact
spinks
contrived
to
separate
the
poet
from
his
poem
he
then
undressed
him
that
is
to
say
by
alternate
feats
of
strength
dexterity
and
cunning
he
succeeded
in
disengaging
him
from
the
looser
portion
of
his
clothing
from
his
shirt
and
trousers
rickman
refused
to
part
refused
with
a
shake
of
the
head
slow
gentle
and
implacable
and
with
a
smile
of
great
sweetness
and
gravity
and
wisdom
he
seemed
to
regard
those
garments
with
a
peculiar
emotion
as
the
symbols
of
his
dignity
and
more
especially
as
the
insignia
of
sobriety
spinks
sat
down
and
stared
at
the
object
of
his
devotion
poor
old
chappie
he
murmured
tenderly
he
was
helpless
before
that
slow
melancholy
shaking
of
the
head
that
mysterious
and
steadfast
smile
he
approached
on
deprecating
feet
but
rickman
would
none
of
him
his
whole
attitude
was
eloquent
of
rebuke
he
waved
spinks
away
with
one
pathetic
hand
with
the
other
he
clutched
and
gathered
round
him
the
last
remnants
of
his
personal
majesty
and
thus
in
his
own
time
and
in
his
own
fashion
he
wandered
to
his
bed
even
then
he
conveyed
reproach
and
reproof
by
his
manner
of
entering
it
he
seemed
to
vanish
subtly
to
withdraw
himself
as
into
some
sacred
and
inviolable
retreat
spinks
crept
away
saddened
by
the
rebuff
after
all
he
was
no
nearer
to
rickman
drunk
than
to
rickman
sober
half
an
hour
later
he
was
asleep
in
the
adjoining
room
dreaming
a
lightsome
dream
of
ladies
and
de
when
suddenly
the
dream
turned
to
a
nightmare
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
descended
upon
him
a
heavy
rolling
weight
as
of
a
bale
of
woollens
he
awoke
and
found
that
it
was
rickman
the
poet
lay
face
downwards
across
the
body
of
his
friend
and
was
crooning
into
his
ear
the
great
chorus
from
the
third
act
of
helen
in
leuce
he
said
that
nobody
but
spinky
understood
it
and
spinky
could
understand
it
if
he
was
drunk
whereupon
spinks
was
most
curiously
uplifted
and
consoled
chapter
xiii
he
woke
tired
out
as
well
he
might
be
after
spending
half
the
night
in
the
pursuit
of
young
joy
personified
in
miss
poppy
grace
young
joy
who
like
that
little
dancer
is
the
swiftest
of
all
swift
things
rickman
carried
into
this
adventure
a
sort
of
innocence
that
renewed
itself
as
by
a
miracle
every
evening
his
youth
remained
virgin
because
of
its
incorruptible
hope
he
almost
disarmed
criticism
by
the
gaiety
the
naïveté
of
the
pursuit
she
was
always
in
front
of
him
that
young
joy
but
if
he
did
not
overtake
her
by
midnight
he
was
all
the
more
sure
that
he
would
find
her
in
the
morning
with
the
dew
on
her
feet
and
the
dawn
on
her
forehead
he
was
convinced
that
it
was
that
sweet
mystic
mouth
of
hers
which
would
one
day
tell
him
the
secret
of
the
world
and
long
before
the
morning
she
would
pick
up
her
skirts
and
be
off
again
swifter
than
ever
carrying
her
secret
with
her
and
so
the
chase
went
on
at
the
present
moment
he
found
himself
in
the
society
of
shame
the
oldest
and
most
haggard
of
all
the
daughters
of
the
night
she
was
in
no
hurry
to
leave
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
sat
beside
him
formless
and
immense
that
she
laid
her
hands
about
him
and
that
the
burning
on
his
poor
forehead
was
her
brand
there
that
the
scorching
in
his
poor
throat
was
the
clutch
of
her
fingers
and
the
torment
in
all
his
miserable
body
her
fine
manipulation
of
his
nerves
she
knew
the
secret
of
the
world
and
had
no
sort
of
hesitation
about
telling
it
it
sounded
to
him
uncommonly
like
something
that
he
had
heard
before
he
recognized
her
as
the
form
and
voice
of
his
own
desire
the
loathsome
familiar
body
of
unutterable
thoughts
sordid
virulent
accusing
with
a
tongue
that
lashed
through
the
flesh
to
the
obscure
spirit
inside
him
and
because
he
was
a
poet
and
knew
himself
a
poet
because
he
had
sinned
chiefly
through
his
imagination
it
was
through
his
imagination
that
he
suffered
so
that
the
horror
was
supreme
for
all
the
while
though
shame
was
there
his
ideas
were
there
too
somewhere
the
divine
thoughts
and
the
proud
beautiful
dreams
and
the
great
pure
loves
winged
and
veiled
they
stood
a
long
way
off
and
turned
away
their
faces
from
him
and
that
was
the
worst
punishment
he
had
to
bear
which
meant
that
as
savage
keith
rickman
lay
in
bed
the
morning
after
that
glorious
april
night
he
knew
that
he
had
been
making
an
april
fool
of
himself
he
knew
it
by
the
pain
in
his
head
and
other
disagreeable
signs
also
by
the
remarkable
fact
that
he
still
wore
the
shirt
and
trousers
of
the
day
and
he
knew
that
in
spite
of
the
pain
he
would
have
to
get
up
and
go
down
to
breakfast
as
if
nothing
had
happened
he
would
have
to
meet
spinks
eyes
twinkling
with
malign
intelligence
and
wondering
looks
and
downey
tender
womanly
concern
as
he
turned
white
over
the
bacon
and
the
butter
he
did
know
which
were
worse
the
knowing
eyes
or
the
innocent
ones
he
had
to
be
at
the
shop
by
nine
too
to
force
that
poor
dizzy
aching
head
of
his
to
its
eight
hours
work
in
this
unnerved
attenuated
state
this
mortal
paleness
of
mind
and
body
it
was
terrible
to
have
to
face
the
robust
reality
of
rickman
at
nine
in
the
morning
it
was
more
real
to
him
than
any
real
thing
it
even
assumed
an
abominable
personality
it
was
an
power
that
sucked
from
him
his
time
his
life
his
energy
and
for
six
days
out
of
the
seven
required
of
him
his
soul
that
at
the
same
time
it
provided
him
with
the
means
of
bodily
subsistence
only
added
to
the
horror
of
the
thing
it
was
as
if
rickman
destroyer
and
preserver
renewed
his
life
every
quarter
day
that
it
might
draw
in
devour
annihilate
it
as
before
there
was
a
diabolical
precision
in
the
action
of
the
machine
that
made
and
unmade
him
and
yet
with
its
rhythm
of
days
and
weeks
it
was
in
its
turn
part
of
a
vaster
system
whose
revolutions
brought
round
a
longer
pause
when
for
three
days
his
soul
would
be
given
back
to
him
the
only
thing
that
kept
him
up
at
this
moment
was
the
blessed
hope
of
the
bank
holiday
while
young
keith
was
still
lying
very
sick
and
miserable
in
his
bed
the
elder
rickman
in
his
villa
residence
at
ilford
in
essex
was
up
and
eager
for
the
day
by
the
time
keith
had
got
down
to
breakfast
isaac
had
caught
the
early
train
that
landed
him
in
the
city
at
nine
before
he
was
in
the
front
shop
taking
a
look
round
and
as
he
looked
round
and
surveyed
his
possessions
his
new
stock
on
the
shelves
his
and
his
mahogany
fittings
his
assistants
from
the
boy
in
shirt
sleeves
now
washing
down
the
great
front
window
to
the
gentlemanly
cashier
high
collared
and
in
his
pew
he
rubbed
his
hands
softly
and
his
heart
swelled
with
thankfulness
and
pride
for
isaac
rickman
was
a
dreamer
too
in
his
way
there
are
dreams
and
dreams
and
the
incontestable
merit
and
glory
of
isaac
dreams
was
that
they
had
all
or
very
nearly
all
come
true
they
were
of
the
sort
that
can
be
handed
over
the
counter
locked
up
in
a
and
lodged
in
the
bank
his
latest
dream
had
been
carried
out
in
and
mahogany
it
towered
into
space
and
was
finished
off
with
a
beautiful
pink
cupola
at
the
top
there
was
not
much
of
the
father
in
the
son
keith
presumably
took
after
his
mother
a
hectic
woman
who
had
died
in
the
supreme
effort
of
his
birth
on
her
own
birth
there
had
been
something
in
the
nature
of
a
slur
she
had
taken
it
to
heart
and
exhausted
herself
in
the
endeavour
to
conceal
from
her
very
respectable
husband
the
shameful
fact
that
she
had
once
served
as
barmaid
in
a
city
restaurant
and
that
she
was
the
illegitimate
daughter
of
a
village
sempstress
and
a
village
squire
isaac
before
he
dreamed
of
greatness
had
met
her
at
a
band
of
hope
meeting
and
had
married
her
because
of
her
sweetness
and
pathetic
beauty
she
left
to
her
boy
her
fairness
her
expressive
face
her
own
nerves
and
her
passion
isaac
and
he
were
alike
only
in
a
certain
slenderness
a
fleshless
refinement
of
physique
coarseness
in
grain
usually
revealed
by
the
lower
half
of
a
man
countenance
had
with
the
elder
rickman
taken
up
its
abode
in
the
superior
the
intellectual
region
isaac
eyes
and
forehead
trafficked
grossly
with
the
world
while
the
rest
of
his
face
preserved
the
stern
reticences
and
sanctities
of
the
spirit
isaac
was
a
wesleyan
and
his
dress
soft
black
felt
hat
smooth
black
narrow
tie
black
but
clerical
almost
suggested
that
he
was
a
minister
of
that
persuasion
his
lips
were
hidden
under
an
iron
grey
moustache
the
short
grizzled
beard
was
smoothed
forward
and
fined
to
a
point
by
the
perpetual
caress
of
a
meditative
hand
such
was
isaac
impossible
to
deny
a
certain
genius
to
the
man
who
had
raised
that
mighty
pile
the
gin
palace
of
art
those
stately
premises
with
their
clustering
lights
their
carpeted
floors
their
polished
fittings
were
very
different
from
the
dark
little
house
in
paternoster
row
where
keith
first
saw
what
light
there
was
to
be
seen
when
isaac
grew
great
and
moved
further
west
the
little
shop
was
kept
on
and
devoted
to
the
sale
of
bibles
and
nonconformist
literature
for
isaac
life
was
a
compromise
between
the
pious
wesleyan
he
was
and
the
successful
tradesman
he
aspired
to
be
there
were
in
fact
two
rickman
rickman
in
the
city
and
rickman
in
the
strand
rickman
in
the
strand
bore
on
its
most
unmistakeably
the
seal
of
the
world
rickman
in
the
city
was
sealed
with
the
seal
so
that
now
there
was
not
a
single
need
of
the
great
public
that
rickman
did
not
provide
for
and
represent
it
pandered
to
isaac
said
catered
for
the
highest
and
the
lowest
the
spirit
as
well
as
the
flesh
only
isaac
was
wise
enough
to
keep
the
two
branches
of
the
business
separate
and
distinct
his
right
hand
professed
complete
ignorance
of
the
doings
of
his
left
it
may
be
that
isaac
heart
was
in
his
city
shop
but
there
was
something
in
him
greater
than
his
heart
his
ambition
which
was
colossal
he
meant
he
always
had
meant
to
be
the
founder
of
a
great
house
which
should
make
the
name
of
rickman
live
after
him
he
aimed
at
nothing
less
than
supremacy
he
proposed
to
spread
his
nets
till
they
had
drawn
in
the
greater
part
of
the
book
trade
of
london
till
rickman
had
reared
its
gigantic
palaces
in
every
district
of
the
capital
in
there
was
some
talk
of
depression
in
the
book
trade
firms
had
failed
isaac
did
not
join
in
the
talk
and
he
had
his
own
theory
of
the
failure
men
went
smash
for
want
of
will
for
want
of
brains
for
want
of
courage
and
capital
above
all
for
want
of
capital
as
if
any
man
need
want
capital
so
long
as
he
had
the
pluck
to
borrow
that
is
to
say
to
buy
it
so
ran
his
dream
and
isaac
believed
in
his
dream
and
what
was
more
he
had
made
richard
pilkington
financial
agent
of
shaftesbury
avenue
believe
in
it
rickman
backed
by
pilkington
would
stand
firm
firm
as
a
rock
courage
and
capital
are
great
but
brains
are
greater
it
was
not
only
by
shrewdness
energy
and
an
incomparable
audacity
that
isaac
rickman
had
raised
himself
from
those
obscure
beginnings
isaac
was
an
artist
in
his
own
enormous
way
and
he
had
made
an
exhaustive
study
of
the
public
with
incredible
versatility
he
followed
every
twist
and
turn
of
the
great
mind
the
slow
colossal
movements
which
make
capital
the
fitful
balancing
the
sudden
start
and
mad
rush
forward
by
which
if
you
can
but
foresee
and
keep
pace
with
it
you
reap
the
golden
harvest
of
the
hour
he
never
took
his
eye
off
the
public
he
laid
his
finger
as
it
were
on
that
mighty
pulse
and
recorded
its
fluctuations
in
his
ledger
but
there
was
a
region
beyond
those
fluctuations
with
new
books
there
was
always
a
pound
worth
of
risk
to
a
pennyworth
of
profit
but
there
was
no
end
of
money
to
be
got
out
of
old
ones
if
only
you
knew
how
to
set
about
it
and
isaac
did
not
quite
know
how
in
his
front
shop
it
was
the
public
in
his
side
shop
it
was
the
books
that
mattered
and
knowledge
of
the
one
however
exhaustive
was
no
guide
to
the
other
isaac
by
himself
cut
a
somewhat
unfortunate
figure
he
stood
fully
equipped
in
the
field
where
there
was
much
danger
and
but
little
gain
he
was
helpless
where
the
price
of
knowledge
ruled
immeasurably
high
in
the
department
audacity
without
education
can
do
nothing
what
he
still
wanted
then
was
brains
and
yet
more
brains
not
the
raw
material
mind
you
he
had
plenty
of
that
but
the
finished
product
the
trained
cultured
intellect
isaac
was
a
man
a
man
ignorant
of
many
things
religious
but
uneducated
but
he
had
a
son
and
the
son
had
a
head
on
his
shoulders
a
magnificent
head
that
boy
had
horace
jewdwine
had
noticed
it
the
first
minute
he
came
into
the
shop
and
the
magnificence
of
head
had
been
pointed
out
to
isaac
long
before
that
when
keith
could
have
been
more
than
ten
why
nine
he
was
that
was
the
beginning
of
it
isaac
could
remember
how
sir
joseph
harden
of
lazarus
the
great
scholar
who
was
one
of
isaac
best
customers
poking
round
the
little
dingy
shop
in
paternoster
row
it
was
all
in
those
days
came
on
the
young
monkey
perched
on
the
reading
homer
sir
joseph
had
made
him
come
down
and
translate
for
him
then
and
there
and
keith
went
at
it
translating
for
twenty
minutes
straight
on
end
sir
joseph
had
said
nothing
but
he
asked
him
what
he
was
going
to
be
and
the
young
turk
grinned
up
at
him
and
said
he
was
going
to
be
a
poet
like
that
was
what
he
was
going
to
be
isaac
had
said
that
was
just
like
his
impudence
but
sir
joseph
stood
there
looking
at
him
and
smiling
on
the
side
of
his
face
that
keith
could
see
and
he
told
the
little
chap
to
work
hard
and
mind
his
rough
breathings
isaac
had
supposed
that
was
some
sort
of
a
joke
for
keith
he
tried
hard
to
grin
though
his
face
went
red
hot
all
over
then
sir
joseph
had
turned
round
very
serious
and
asked
if
he
rickman
had
any
other
sons
because
whatever
he
did
with
the
rest
of
them
he
must
make
this
one
a
scholar
isaac
had
said
no
he
had
any
but
that
one
boy
and
he
would
have
to
be
brought
up
to
the
business
he
was
afraid
he
could
spare
the
time
to
make
much
of
a
scholar
of
him
time
said
isaac
was
money
what
sir
joseph
said
then
isaac
had
never
forgotten
he
had
said
true
time
was
money
loose
cash
in
your
pockets
but
brains
were
capital
and
there
a
better
investment
for
them
he
had
added
than
a
good
sound
classical
education
isaac
was
to
send
the
boy
to
the
city
of
london
then
to
the
london
university
if
he
could
rise
to
oxford
but
sir
joseph
advice
was
oxford
let
him
try
for
a
scholarship
he
added
that
he
would
like
to
do
something
for
him
later
on
if
he
lived
isaac
had
never
forgotten
it
his
memory
being
assisted
by
the
circumstance
that
sir
joseph
had
that
very
same
day
bought
one
hundred
and
pounds
worth
of
books
for
his
great
library
down
in
devonshire
the
boy
was
sent
to
an
academy
then
to
the
city
of
london
isaac
had
not
risen
to
oxford
keith
never
tried
for
a
scholarship
and
if
he
had
isaac
would
have
drawn
the
line
at
a
university
education
as
tending
towards
an
unholy
leisure
and
the
wisdom
of
this
world
otherwise
he
had
spared
no
expense
for
he
had
grasped
the
fact
that
this
was
an
investment
and
he
looked
to
have
his
money
back
again
with
something
like
fifty
per
cent
interest
and
the
boy
the
boy
was
to
come
back
too
with
a
brain
as
bright
as
steel
all
its
queer
little
complicated
parts
in
working
order
in
short
a
superb
machine
and
isaac
would
only
have
to
touch
a
spring
to
set
it
going
but
the
question
was
what
spring
and
that
unfortunately
was
what
old
rickman
never
could
lay
his
finger
on
still
it
went
that
machine
of
his
apparently
of
its
own
accord
it
went
mysteriously
capriciously
but
fairly
satisfactorily
on
the
whole
and
isaac
was
wise
his
very
respect
for
the
thing
that
had
cost
him
so
much
prevented
him
from
tampering
with
it
it
was
in
accordance
with
this
policy
of
caution
that
they
lived
apart
isaac
loved
the
suburbs
keith
loved
the
town
and
it
was
as
well
for
one
of
them
to
live
in
it
near
to
their
place
of
business
isaac
had
married
again
and
though
he
was
proud
of
his
boy
and
fond
of
him
he
contrived
to
be
completely
happy
without
him
he
loved
his
little
detached
villa
residence
at
ilford
in
essex
with
its
little
showing
from
the
high
road
its
little
stable
for
the
pony
and
little
paddock
for
the
cow
he
loved
his
large
second
wife
with
her
large
balance
at
the
bank
and
still
larger
credit
in
the
wesleyan
circle
they
lived
and
moved
in
he
loved
that
wesleyan
circle
the
comfortable
safe
community
that
knew
only
the
best
the
sunday
best
of
him
and
keith
loved
none
of
these
things
by
the
education
he
had
got
and
which
he
isaac
had
given
him
by
the
religion
he
had
got
and
which
nothing
would
induce
him
to
take
by
the
obscure
barriers
of
individuality
and
temperament
the
son
was
separated
from
the
father
as
for
meeting
each
other
isaac
had
tried
it
once
or
twice
of
a
sunday
when
keith
had
met
him
indeed
but
with
a
directness
that
shocked
isaac
and
distressed
him
he
was
made
positively
uncomfortable
by
his
son
superiority
though
the
boy
did
bring
it
out
and
show
it
isaac
felt
all
the
time
that
it
was
there
he
was
very
much
happier
without
the
boy
keith
among
other
things
suggested
vividly
the
thoughts
which
the
wesleyan
desired
to
put
away
from
saturday
afternoon
to
monday
morning
thoughts
of
the
present
evil
world
for
which
on
sundays
he
more
than
half
suspected
that
he
might
be
imperilling
his
immortal
soul
sometimes
in
the
watches
of
the
night
especially
of
a
sunday
night
it
occurred
to
him
that
owing
to
the
domestic
arrangement
which
kept
the
boy
in
a
place
which
when
all
was
said
and
done
was
a
place
of
temptation
keith
soul
no
less
immortal
might
be
in
jeopardy
too
he
thought
of
him
an
innocent
lad
thrown
on
the
mercy
of
london
as
it
were
but
isaac
had
faith
in
the
mercy
of
the
lord
besides
he
was
the
sort
a
quiet
studious
young
fellow
like
keith
was
and
when
isaac
conscience
began
to
feel
a
little
uncertain
upon
that
point
he
simply
laid
the
case
circumstantially
before
the
lord
who
knew
all
his
difficulties
and
all
his
sins
and
was
infinitely
able
and
eternally
willing
to
bear
them
for
him
by
casting
keith
upon
the
lord
an
immense
burden
of
responsibility
was
slipped
from
his
conscience
and
by
the
time
monday
morning
came
round
isaac
was
again
convinced
that
he
had
made
the
very
best
arrangements
for
not
only
was
the
state
of
keith
soul
a
reproach
to
conscience
but
the
brilliance
of
keith
intellect
was
a
terror
to
it
any
day
that
same
swift
illuminating
power
might
be
turned
on
to
the
dark
places
in
his
own
soul
showing
up
the
deplorable
discrepancies
between
his
inner
and
his
outer
life
he
wanted
his
son
and
everybody
else
to
think
well
of
him
and
keith
lucid
sincerity
at
times
appalled
him
he
had
not
yet
discovered
that
his
protection
was
in
the
very
thing
he
feared
keith
was
so
recklessly
that
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
his
father
could
lead
a
double
life
he
never
doubted
for
an
instant
that
as
in
his
own
case
the
saturday
to
monday
state
revealed
the
real
man
he
keith
sat
so
lightly
to
the
business
and
with
so
detached
a
mind
that
he
simply
could
not
imagine
how
any
human
being
could
be
so
wedded
to
a
thing
in
itself
uninteresting
as
to
sacrifice
to
it
any
immortal
chances
the
book
trade
was
not
a
matter
for
high
spiritual
romance
it
was
simply
the
way
they
got
their
living
as
honest
a
way
as
any
other
taking
it
all
round
the
shop
was
one
thing
and
his
father
was
another
in
fact
so
far
from
identifying
them
he
was
inclined
to
pity
his
father
as
a
of
the
tyranny
and
malignity
of
the
shop
but
when
in
his
right
mind
he
had
no
grudge
whatever
against
the
shop
he
had
been
born
over
the
shop
nursed
behind
the
shop
and
the
shop
had
been
his
schoolroom
ever
since
he
could
spell
it
was
books
found
in
the
shop
and
studied
in
the
shop
that
first
opened
his
eyes
to
the
glory
of
the
world
as
he
sat
on
the
reading
his
shakespeare
or
puzzling
out
his
first
greek
by
the
light
of
a
single
and
for
the
sake
of
these
things
he
had
a
tender
recollection
of
paternoster
row
it
was
to
rickman
that
he
owed
his
education
doggedly
at
first
and
afterwards
mechanically
abstractedly
he
got
through
the
work
he
had
to
do
at
times
he
even
appreciated
with
a
certain
enjoyment
the
exquisite
irony
of
his
fate
perhaps
when
it
came
to
the
gin
palace
of
art
he
had
felt
that
the
thing
was
getting
almost
beyond
a
joke
he
had
not
been
prepared
for
that
lurid
departure
he
did
not
realize
that
he
was
in
it
that
his
father
had
staked
not
only
his
hopes
but
his
capital
on
him
he
simply
knew
that
the
was
wrapt
up
in
the
horrid
thing
that
he
had
spent
enormous
sums
on
it
and
he
was
going
to
throw
him
over
at
the
start
but
he
had
not
the
smallest
intention
of
spending
his
whole
life
so
as
always
long
ago
in
the
darkness
of
the
city
shop
he
had
seen
a
brilliance
of
his
own
spreading
around
rickman
and
beyond
it
shining
away
into
the
distance
so
he
saw
it
now
flinging
out
a
broad
flaming
unmistakable
path
that
could
by
no
possibility
lead
back
there
he
only
suffered
a
certain
limited
and
unimportant
part
of
him
to
be
made
into
a
machine
meanwhile
it
was
perhaps
in
the
divine
mercy
that
the
workings
of
this
machine
were
hidden
from
isaac
he
had
even
found
out
that
the
secret
spring
was
not
in
the
brain
but
the
heart
of
it
he
would
look
up
a
little
uneasily
as
keith
pushed
through
the
big
swinging
doors
and
took
his
seat
at
the
table
on
the
platform
and
while
he
wondered
what
keith
was
thinking
of
him
ten
to
one
keith
was
thinking
of
him
at
all
this
morning
however
he
thinking
of
him
as
it
happened
and
when
the
old
man
saw
him
up
there
holding
his
poor
bursting
head
in
his
hands
and
said
achin
my
boy
again
that
comes
of
studyin
too
he
thought
with
a
touch
of
compunction
what
would
he
say
if
he
knew
i
gone
drunk
to
bed
last
night
and
if
he
knew
about
poppy
isaac
approached
his
son
gingerly
and
with
a
certain
fear
the
only
thing
he
had
discovered
about
this
admirable
machine
of
his
was
that
it
went
better
when
you
left
it
alone
it
had
not
been
going
quite
so
well
lately
though
and
this
morning
it
seemed
decidedly
out
of
order
he
took
a
seat
at
the
table
and
busied
himself
with
a
catalogue
presently
he
rose
and
touched
the
boy
gently
on
the
shoulder
come
into
the
office
a
minute
will
you
he
said
with
a
glance
at
the
cashier
and
keith
wondering
what
on
earth
he
wanted
with
him
followed
into
a
recess
shut
on
from
the
shop
by
a
and
mahogany
screen
isaac
hunted
among
the
papers
on
his
for
a
letter
he
could
not
find
you
remember
your
old
friend
sir
joseph
harden
do
you
yes
keith
was
in
fact
devoted
to
sir
joseph
memory
he
had
often
wondered
what
it
was
that
mysterious
something
which
sir
joseph
would
have
done
for
him
if
he
had
lived
and
whether
if
he
had
done
it
it
would
have
made
a
difference
well
i
got
a
letter
from
his
place
in
devonshire
this
morning
they
asked
me
to
send
them
some
one
down
to
catalogue
his
library
they
want
an
expert
and
he
must
go
at
once
and
finish
by
the
or
it
no
use
dear
me
where
is
that
letter
keith
goaded
his
brain
to
an
agonizing
activity
it
seemed
to
him
that
some
such
proposal
had
been
made
to
him
before
but
where
or
when
he
could
for
the
life
of
him
remember
pilkington
says
he
told
you
something
about
it
last
night
heard
from
him
this
morning
too
pilkington
he
remembered
now
dicky
had
bothered
him
about
a
library
last
night
and
he
had
wished
dicky
at
the
devil
he
beat
his
brains
till
he
struck
from
them
an
illuminating
flash
lord
how
it
hurt
too
he
did
say
it
was
the
harden
library
it
is
though
isaac
coarse
forehead
flushed
with
triumph
promised
me
the
refusal
of
it
when
it
comes
into
the
market
at
any
other
time
keith
would
have
been
interested
but
his
head
ached
too
much
now
still
he
was
not
too
far
gone
to
recognize
the
magnitude
of
the
affair
you
have
to
go
down
and
look
at
it
continued
isaac
persuasively
and
here
the
opportunity
you
go
on
their
business
and
do
mine
at
the
same
time
and
get
well
paid
for
it
too
i
do
quite
like
going
that
way
if
the
thing
got
to
be
sold
why
do
they
want
it
catalogued
that
their
business
not
mine
it
looks
like
mistake
whoever
they
are
where
the
letter
i
mislaid
it
that
not
my
business
either
my
business
is
to
send
you
off
before
they
find
out
their
mistake
you
can
catch
the
eleven
express
from
waterloo
if
you
look
sharp
sharp
never
had
he
looked
less
so
still
with
his
aching
head
he
dimly
perceived
that
his
easter
was
being
tampered
with
and
supposing
they
want
me
to
stay
stay
then
the
longer
the
better
i
go
after
easter
then
i
ca
go
before
i
ca
possibly
it
it
out
of
the
question
his
brain
was
clear
enough
on
that
point
he
had
suffered
many
things
from
the
brutality
of
rickman
but
hitherto
its
dealings
had
always
been
plain
and
it
had
kept
him
many
an
evening
working
overtime
it
had
even
exacted
an
occasional
saturday
afternoon
but
it
had
never
before
swindled
him
out
of
a
bank
holiday
the
thing
was
incredible
it
could
not
be
rickman
had
no
rights
over
his
easter
whatever
happened
that
holy
festival
was
indubitably
incontestably
his
do
be
afraid
you
get
your
holiday
my
boy
when
you
come
back
i
make
it
worth
your
while
it
is
money
damn
my
head
it
so
confoundedly
inconvenient
you
see
i
made
no
end
of
engagements
it
a
foolish
thing
to
make
engagements
so
long
beforehand
we
never
know
the
day
or
the
hour
i
knew
both
well
in
any
case
you
could
be
going
to
any
place
of
amusement
on
the
sunday
isaac
and
his
conscience
had
agreed
together
to
assume
that
young
keith
walked
habitually
and
of
his
own
fancy
in
the
right
way
come
he
continued
you
not
going
to
fling
up
a
chance
like
this
without
rhyme
or
reason
i
do
know
said
keith
with
a
queer
little
smile
fling
up
a
good
many
chances
for
a
really
good
rhyme
as
for
reason
there
were
at
least
two
reasons
why
the
present
chance
should
not
lightly
be
let
go
one
was
the
harden
library
if
the
harden
library
was
not
great
it
was
almost
historic
it
contained
the
aldine
plato
of
the
neapolitan
horace
of
and
the
of
wynkyn
de
worde
the
other
reason
was
dicky
pilkington
the
vandal
into
whose
hands
destiny
had
delivered
it
upon
the
harden
library
pilkington
was
about
to
descend
like
alaric
on
the
treasures
of
rome
rickman
was
hand
in
glove
with
pilkington
and
since
the
young
barbarian
actually
offered
them
the
chance
of
buying
it
outright
for
an
old
song
no
time
was
to
be
lost
it
would
not
do
to
trust
too
long
to
dicky
ignorance
at
any
moment
knowledge
might
enter
into
him
and
corrupt
his
soul
no
clearly
he
would
have
to
go
he
did
see
how
he
was
to
get
out
of
it
isaac
became
uneasy
for
the
spirit
of
imprecation
sat
visibly
on
his
son
brow
when
i
said
i
make
it
worth
your
while
i
meant
it
i
know
it
is
that
wot
is
it
wot
is
it
then
wot
the
matter
with
you
wot
tomfoolery
are
you
up
to
is
it
isaac
gross
forehead
flushed
his
speech
came
thick
through
his
stern
lips
is
it
a
woman
he
had
also
been
young
though
he
had
denied
his
youth
the
boy
white
face
quivered
with
a
little
wave
of
heat
and
pain
he
clasped
his
forehead
with
his
hands
let
me
think
his
fingers
tightened
their
hold
as
if
to
grasp
thought
by
holding
the
dizzy
aching
head
that
contained
it
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
poppy
he
had
seen
his
father
point
quite
steadily
and
clearly
a
minute
ago
but
when
he
thought
of
poppy
his
brain
began
to
turn
round
and
round
again
he
gripped
his
forehead
harder
still
to
stop
it
his
thinking
drifted
into
a
kind
of
moody
metaphysics
instead
of
concentrating
itself
on
the
matter
in
hand
it
takes
a
poet
he
said
to
himself
to
create
a
world
and
this
world
would
disgrace
a
junior
journalist
was
it
he
wondered
the
last
effort
of
a
cycle
of
transcendental
decadence
melancholy
sophisticated
or
was
it
a
cruel
young
jest
flung
off
in
the
barbarous
of
creative
energy
either
way
it
chiefly
impressed
him
with
its
imbecility
he
saw
through
it
he
saw
through
most
things
himself
included
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
had
developed
this
sudden
turn
for
speculative
thought
because
he
was
baulked
of
an
appointment
with
a
little
variety
actress
that
he
should
see
through
the
little
variety
actress
was
not
to
be
expected
poppy
was
in
her
nature
impenetrable
woman
being
the
ultimate
fact
the
inexorable
necessity
of
thought
supposing
the
universe
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
dance
of
fortuitous
atoms
then
poppy
herself
a
fortuitous
atom
led
the
dance
she
was
the
whirligig
centre
towards
which
all
things
whirled
no
wonder
that
it
made
him
giddy
to
think
of
her
suddenly
out
of
its
giddiness
his
brain
conceived
and
instantly
matured
a
plan
a
practical
plan
he
would
catch
that
express
all
right
he
would
go
down
into
devonshire
and
stay
in
devonshire
till
saturday
if
necessary
he
would
sit
up
with
those
abominable
books
all
thursday
night
and
friday
night
and
on
saturday
he
would
return
at
the
worst
he
would
only
have
to
go
down
again
on
monday
he
would
have
missed
the
junior
journalists
dinner
he
would
be
lucky
if
he
saw
the
ghost
of
an
idea
on
this
side
whit
sunday
but
he
would
have
torn
the
heart
out
of
his
holiday
he
rose
abruptly
all
right
it
a
most
awful
nuisance
as
it
happens
but
i
go
i
glad
you
willing
to
oblige
me
you
not
regret
it
isaac
was
really
meditating
something
very
handsome
in
the
way
of
a
commission
as
he
looked
benignly
into
his
son
face
and
saw
its
deep
misery
and
repugnance
he
answered
his
own
question
it
a
woman
book
ii
lucia
way
chapter
xiv
he
wondered
how
much
longer
they
were
going
to
keep
him
waiting
his
head
still
ached
and
every
nerve
was
irritable
he
began
to
suspect
the
servant
of
having
failed
to
report
his
arrival
he
thought
of
ringing
for
him
and
announcing
himself
a
second
time
then
he
remembered
that
he
was
only
the
man
who
had
come
about
the
books
he
was
there
on
the
hardens
business
and
their
time
was
his
time
and
there
were
worse
places
to
wait
in
than
the
library
of
court
house
he
found
himself
in
a
long
low
room
that
seemed
to
him
immense
it
was
lighted
by
four
windows
one
to
the
south
one
a
smaller
side
lattice
to
the
east
two
to
the
west
and
still
the
corners
were
left
in
gloom
the
bookcases
that
covered
the
length
and
height
of
the
walls
were
of
one
blackness
with
the
oak
floor
and
ceiling
the
scattered
blues
and
crimsons
of
the
carpets
repeated
in
duller
tones
in
the
old
morocco
bindings
the
gilded
tracery
of
the
tooling
and
here
and
there
a
gave
an
effect
as
of
some
dim
rich
arabesque
flung
on
to
the
darkness
at
this
hour
the
sunlight
made
the
most
of
all
it
found
there
it
washed
the
faded
carpet
with
a
new
dye
it
licked
every
jutting
angle
every
polished
surface
every
patch
of
vellum
it
streamed
out
of
the
great
golden
white
busts
on
their
pedestals
in
the
windows
it
lay
in
pale
gleams
over
the
eastern
walls
till
it
perished
in
the
marble
blackness
of
the
roof
and
floor
sucked
in
as
by
an
upper
and
nether
abyss
this
blackness
intensified
the
glory
of
the
april
world
outside
whose
luminous
greens
and
blues
were
held
like
blazonry
in
the
leaded
lozenge
panes
the
two
western
windows
thrown
open
looked
over
the
valley
to
the
hills
castle
hill
with
its
black
battlement
of
pines
and
core
to
harmouth
gap
the
great
doorway
of
the
west
wind
and
the
straight
brown
flank
of
muttersmoor
stretching
to
the
sea
he
seated
himself
by
one
of
these
open
lattices
looked
at
the
view
one
of
the
loveliest
in
south
devon
and
thought
of
miss
poppy
grace
the
vision
of
her
that
had
still
attended
him
on
his
journey
down
faded
as
if
rebuked
by
the
great
tranquil
presence
of
the
hills
he
was
left
supremely
magically
alone
now
it
may
have
been
prescience
it
may
have
been
merely
the
deplorable
state
of
his
nerves
but
as
he
continued
to
look
out
upon
that
unfamiliar
landscape
the
beauty
of
it
in
growing
on
him
became
almost
intolerable
it
affected
him
with
an
indescribable
uneasiness
a
yearning
a
foreboding
a
terror
he
gave
a
deep
sigh
and
turned
his
back
on
it
abruptly
he
picked
up
a
book
that
lay
on
the
window
seat
it
was
the
of
and
the
history
of
harmouth
was
the
history
of
the
hardens
of
court
house
court
house
was
older
than
harmouth
and
the
hardens
were
older
than
court
house
in
early
tudor
times
the
chronicler
informed
him
the
house
was
the
court
of
justice
for
east
devon
under
elizabeth
it
and
the
land
for
miles
around
it
passed
to
the
hardens
as
a
reward
for
their
services
to
the
crown
the
first
thing
they
did
was
to
pull
down
the
gibbet
on
the
north
side
and
build
their
kitchen
offices
there
next
they
threw
out
a
short
wing
to
the
east
and
another
to
the
west
enclosing
a
pleasant
courtyard
on
the
south
the
west
wing
was
now
thrown
into
one
with
the
long
room
that
held
the
harden
library
rickman
searched
carefully
for
information
under
this
head
he
learnt
that
the
harden
library
was
the
work
of
ten
generations
of
scholars
beginning
with
sir
thomas
a
jacobean
maker
of
madrigals
and
ending
with
sir
joseph
the
victorian
master
of
lazarus
that
the
date
is
carved
on
the
oak
at
the
north
end
with
the
harden
motto
invictus
that
the
late
master
of
lazarus
bought
books
by
the
cartload
and
was
obliged
to
break
through
the
south
wall
and
sacrifice
the
west
wing
his
wife
boudoir
to
make
room
for
them
but
where
he
looked
for
some
record
of
these
treasures
he
found
nothing
but
an
elaborate
description
of
the
harden
arms
with
all
their
quarterings
the
historian
was
not
useful
for
rickman
purposes
he
was
preoccupied
with
the
hardens
their
antiquity
and
splendour
he
grovelled
before
them
every
event
in
their
history
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
observing
that
their
motto
was
he
certainly
seemed
to
have
found
them
so
for
when
he
wrote
of
them
his
style
took
on
the
curious
contortions
and
prostrations
of
his
spirit
the
poor
wretch
in
the
pay
of
the
local
bookseller
had
saturated
himself
with
heraldry
till
he
saw
gules
to
a
vision
thus
inflamed
was
simply
a
quaint
hereditary
freak
and
scholarship
a
distinction
wholly
superfluous
in
a
race
that
owned
half
the
parish
and
had
its
arms
blazoned
on
the
east
windows
of
a
church
and
the
of
a
and
with
the
last
generation
the
hereditary
passion
had
apparently
exhausted
itself
the
present
owner
sir
frederick
harden
said
the
chronicler
has
made
no
addition
to
the
library
of
his
ancestors
what
he
had
done
was
not
recorded
in
the
history
of
the
hardens
it
was
silent
also
as
to
the
ladies
of
that
house
beyond
drawing
attention
to
the
curious
fact
that
no
woman
had
ever
been
permitted
to
inherit
the
harden
library
the
inspired
pen
of
the
chronicler
evoked
the
long
procession
of
those
hardens
whose
motto
was
crusading
hardens
hardens
in
trunk
hose
hardens
in
ruff
and
doublet
in
ruffles
and
periwig
hardens
in
powder
and
patches
in
the
loosest
of
stocks
and
the
tightest
of
trousers
and
never
a
petticoat
among
them
all
it
was
just
as
well
rickman
reflected
that
poppy
frivolous
little
phantom
had
not
danced
after
him
into
the
harden
library
those
other
phantoms
might
not
have
received
it
very
kindly
unless
indeed
sir
thomas
the
maker
of
madrigals
had
spared
it
a
shadowy
smile
he
looked
round
and
realized
that
his
separation
from
poppy
would
be
disagreeably
prolonged
if
he
was
expected
to
catalogue
and
arrange
all
the
books
in
the
harden
library
allowing
so
much
time
to
so
much
space
measuring
by
feet
of
bookshelf
hours
ran
rapidly
to
days
and
days
to
weeks
why
months
might
pass
and
find
him
still
labouring
there
he
would
be
buried
in
the
blackness
forgotten
by
poppy
and
the
world
that
was
assuming
that
the
harden
library
really
belonged
to
the
hardens
and
if
it
was
to
belong
to
dicky
pilkington
what
on
earth
had
he
been
sent
for
you
were
sent
in
answer
to
my
letter
i
suppose
rickman
nervous
system
was
still
so
far
under
the
dominion
of
dicky
champagne
that
he
started
violently
double
doors
and
double
carpets
deadened
all
sound
of
coming
and
going
and
the
voice
seemed
to
have
got
into
the
room
by
itself
as
from
its
softness
he
judged
it
to
be
still
some
yards
distant
he
suffered
a
further
shock
on
finding
a
lady
standing
by
his
elbow
it
had
been
growing
on
him
lately
this
habit
of
starting
at
nothing
this
ridiculous
spasm
of
eyelids
and
mouth
it
was
a
cause
of
many
smiles
to
the
young
ladies
of
his
and
this
lady
was
smiling
too
though
after
another
fashion
her
smile
was
remote
and
delicately
poised
it
hovered
in
the
fine
corners
of
her
mouth
and
eyes
it
sobered
suddenly
as
a
second
and
less
violent
movement
turned
towards
her
his
white
and
too
expressive
face
he
could
not
say
by
what
subtle
and
tender
transitions
it
passed
into
indifference
nor
how
in
passing
it
contrived
to
intimate
her
regret
at
having
taken
him
somewhat
at
a
disadvantage
it
was
all
done
and
atoned
for
in
the
lifting
of
an
eyelid
before
he
could
take
in
what
she
had
actually
said
her
letter
he
murmured
some
sort
of
assent
and
entered
on
a
dreamy
and
protracted
search
for
his
pocket
handkerchief
he
was
miserably
conscious
that
she
was
looking
looking
down
on
him
all
the
time
for
this
lady
was
tall
so
tall
indeed
that
her
gaze
seemed
to
light
on
his
eyelids
rather
than
his
eyes
when
he
had
found
his
courage
and
his
handkerchief
he
looked
up
and
their
eyes
met
half
way
hers
were
brown
with
the
tinge
of
hazel
that
makes
brown
eyes
clear
they
had
a
liquid
surface
of
light
divided
from
their
darkness
and
behind
the
darkness
was
more
light
and
the
light
and
darkness
were
both
unfathomable
these
eyes
were
entirely
unembarrassed
by
the
encounter
they
still
swept
him
with
their
long
gaze
lucid
meditative
and
a
little
critical
you
have
been
very
prompt
we
understood
that
no
time
was
to
be
lost
she
hesitated
rickman
understood
did
he
not
that
i
asked
for
some
one
with
experience
most
certainly
rickman
understood
do
you
think
you
will
be
able
to
do
what
i
want
her
eyes
implied
that
he
seemed
to
her
too
young
to
have
had
any
experience
at
all
knowing
that
a
sense
of
humour
was
not
one
of
the
things
required
of
him
he
controlled
a
smile
we
understood
you
wanted
an
expert
so
i
came
myself
you
are
rickman
then
well
rickman
son
the
lady
puckered
her
brows
as
if
trying
to
recall
something
an
idea
a
memory
that
escaped
her
she
gave
it
up
have
you
been
waiting
long
not
more
than
half
an
hour
or
so
i
am
sorry
perhaps
you
had
better
stay
now
and
see
what
has
to
be
done
he
was
tired
he
had
eaten
nothing
all
day
his
nerves
were
out
of
order
and
he
had
an
abominable
headache
but
he
intimated
that
he
and
his
time
were
at
her
service
she
spoke
with
authority
and
he
wondered
who
she
was
sir
frederick
harden
daughter
or
his
sister
or
his
wife
as
you
see
the
books
are
fairly
well
arranged
it
will
not
take
very
long
to
sort
them
oh
would
it
though
his
heart
sank
miserably
as
he
followed
her
progress
round
the
room
they
have
to
be
catalogued
under
their
subjects
alphabetically
of
course
quite
so
she
continued
with
the
same
swiftness
and
serenity
mistress
of
his
time
and
intelligence
as
of
her
own
luminous
and
elaborate
plan
their
size
will
have
to
be
given
the
edition
the
place
and
date
of
publication
the
number
of
their
shelf
and
their
place
on
the
shelves
their
place
on
the
shelves
indeed
if
those
books
had
got
into
dicky
pilkington
clutches
their
place
would
know
them
no
more
he
wondered
did
she
know
nothing
about
dicky
pilkington
her
plan
implied
certainty
of
possession
the
permanence
of
the
harden
library
world
without
end
he
wondered
whether
he
ought
not
to
remind
her
that
it
might
be
about
to
come
into
the
market
if
it
were
not
already
as
good
as
sold
besides
the
cataloguing
i
want
notes
on
all
the
rare
or
remarkable
books
i
believe
some
of
them
are
unique
he
wondered
more
and
more
and
ended
by
wondering
whether
dicky
pilkington
were
really
so
sure
of
his
game
i
see
you
want
a
catalogue
i
want
something
like
this
she
opened
a
drawer
and
showed
him
one
of
rickman
special
quarterly
catalogues
of
a
year
back
he
remembered
it
used
to
be
sent
regularly
to
old
sir
joseph
harden
their
best
customer
my
grandfather
said
these
catalogues
were
models
of
their
kind
they
could
only
have
been
done
by
a
scholar
he
wanted
the
library
catalogued
on
the
same
lines
it
was
to
have
been
done
in
his
lifetime
i
wish
it
had
been
i
should
have
liked
to
have
worked
for
sir
joseph
stirred
by
the
praise
and
by
a
sudden
recollection
of
sir
joseph
he
spoke
with
a
certain
emotion
so
that
an
aitch
went
by
the
board
are
you
quite
sure
said
she
that
you
know
all
about
this
sort
of
work
had
she
noticed
that
hideous
accident
and
did
it
shake
her
belief
in
his
fitness
for
the
scholarly
task
this
my
work
i
made
that
catalogue
i
have
to
make
them
every
quarter
so
it
keeps
my
hand
in
are
you
a
quick
worker
yes
i
can
be
pretty
quick
could
you
finish
my
catalogue
by
the
that
a
little
more
than
three
weeks
well
it
would
depend
rather
on
the
number
of
notes
you
wanted
let
me
see
there
must
be
about
fourteen
or
fifteen
thousand
books
here
there
are
fifteen
thousand
it
would
take
three
weeks
to
make
an
ordinary
catalogue
and
that
would
be
quick
work
even
for
me
i
afraid
you
must
give
me
rather
more
time
i
ca
i
leaving
england
on
the
could
i
go
on
with
it
in
your
absence
no
that
would
hardly
do
if
you
could
only
give
me
another
week
i
could
possibly
i
have
to
join
my
father
at
cannes
on
the
so
she
was
sir
frederick
harden
daughter
then
not
his
wife
her
last
words
were
illuminating
they
suggested
the
programme
of
a
family
whose
affairs
were
in
liquidation
they
also
revealed
sir
frederick
harden
amazing
indifference
to
the
fate
of
the
library
an
indifference
that
argued
a
certain
ignorance
of
its
commercial
value
his
father
who
had
a
scent
keen
as
a
hound
for
business
had
taken
in
the
situation
and
dicky
you
might
trust
dicky
to
be
sure
of
his
game
but
if
this
were
so
why
should
the
hardens
engage
in
such
a
leisurely
and
expensive
undertaking
as
a
catalogue
was
the
gay
sir
frederick
trying
to
throw
dust
in
the
eyes
of
his
creditors
i
see
he
said
sir
frederick
harden
is
anxious
to
have
the
catalogue
finished
before
you
leave
no
he
is
anxious
about
it
at
all
he
does
know
it
being
done
it
is
entirely
my
affair
so
sir
frederick
affairs
and
his
daughter
were
separate
and
distinct
and
apparently
neither
knew
what
the
other
was
about
rickman
conscience
reproached
him
for
the
rather
low
cunning
which
had
prompted
him
to
force
her
hand
it
also
suggested
that
he
ought
not
to
take
advantage
of
her
ignorance
miss
harden
was
charming
but
evidently
she
was
a
little
rash
if
i
may
make
the
suggestion
it
might
perhaps
be
wiser
to
wait
till
your
return
if
it
is
done
before
i
go
said
miss
harden
it
may
never
be
done
at
all
and
you
are
very
anxious
that
it
should
be
done
yes
i
am
but
if
you
ca
do
it
you
had
better
say
so
at
once
that
would
not
be
strictly
true
i
could
do
it
if
i
worked
at
it
pretty
nearly
all
day
and
half
the
night
say
sixteen
hours
out
of
the
you
are
thinking
of
one
person
work
yes
but
if
there
are
two
persons
then
of
course
it
would
take
eight
hours
so
if
worked
too
in
that
case
he
replied
imperturbably
it
would
take
twelve
hours
you
said
eight
just
now
assuming
that
the
two
persons
worked
equally
hard
she
crossed
to
a
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
it
was
littered
with
papers
she
brought
and
showed
him
some
sheets
covered
with
delicate
handwriting
her
work
poor
lady
this
is
a
rough
catalogue
as
far
as
i
got
i
think
it
will
be
some
help
very
great
help
he
murmured
stung
by
an
indescribable
compunction
he
had
not
reckoned
on
this
complication
and
it
made
the
ambiguity
of
his
position
detestable
it
was
bad
enough
to
come
sneaking
into
her
house
as
his
father
agent
and
spy
and
be
doing
his
business
all
the
while
that
this
adorably
innocent
lady
believed
him
to
be
exclusively
engaged
on
hers
but
that
she
should
work
with
him
toiling
at
a
catalogue
which
would
eventually
be
rickman
catalogue
there
was
something
in
the
notion
extremely
repulsive
to
his
sense
of
honour
under
its
muffling
of
headache
his
mind
wrestled
feebly
with
the
situation
he
wished
he
had
not
got
drunk
last
night
so
that
he
could
see
the
thing
clearly
all
round
as
far
as
he
could
see
at
present
the
only
decent
course
was
to
back
out
of
it
what
i
have
done
covers
the
first
five
sections
up
to
i
see
he
said
with
a
faint
interest
you
are
keeping
the
classical
and
modern
sections
distinct
yes
i
thought
that
was
better
much
better
i
have
begun
the
classical
section
yet
can
i
leave
that
to
you
certainly
he
felt
that
every
assent
was
committing
him
to
he
knew
not
what
you
see
a
great
deal
of
the
work
is
done
already
that
makes
a
difference
does
it
oh
yes
it
makes
all
the
difference
and
indeed
it
did
in
this
case
you
can
undertake
it
no
i
think
that
in
this
case
i
could
undertake
it
at
all
but
why
not
she
asked
as
well
she
might
why
not
indeed
he
walked
two
or
three
paces
from
her
trying
to
think
it
out
if
only
his
head
did
ache
so
abominably
to
refuse
to
share
the
work
with
her
was
of
course
to
lay
himself
open
to
a
most
disgusting
suspicion
he
paced
back
again
did
she
suspect
him
of
mercenary
motives
no
she
suspected
nothing
her
face
expressed
disappointment
and
bewilderment
so
far
as
she
allowed
it
to
express
anything
one
more
turn
thank
goodness
she
was
not
looking
at
him
she
was
giving
him
time
only
a
second
though
she
had
seated
herself
as
much
as
to
say
she
was
now
waiting
for
an
explanation
he
must
keep
her
waiting
he
must
say
something
but
what
on
earth
was
he
going
to
say
and
as
he
looked
at
the
lady
so
serenely
seated
there
rose
up
before
him
a
sudden
impertinent
incongruous
vision
of
miss
poppy
legs
they
reminded
him
that
certain
affairs
of
his
own
imperatively
called
him
back
to
town
happy
thought
why
not
say
so
i
ought
to
have
said
that
in
any
case
i
could
undertake
it
i
could
make
time
without
giving
up
some
very
important
engagements
could
you
not
have
thought
of
that
before
you
came
i
did
think
of
it
i
thought
i
could
fit
everything
in
by
going
up
to
town
from
saturday
to
monday
but
if
i
to
finish
by
the
even
even
with
your
help
i
ought
to
lose
a
day
much
less
three
days
i
see
you
are
afraid
of
not
being
able
to
finish
he
wavered
selecting
some
form
of
expression
that
might
shadow
forth
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
i
afraid
of
making
any
promises
i
might
be
able
to
keep
man
vacillation
is
fate
determination
and
miss
harden
was
as
firm
as
fate
he
felt
that
the
fine
long
hands
playing
with
the
catalogue
were
shaping
events
for
him
while
her
eyes
measured
him
with
their
meditative
gaze
i
must
risk
that
she
said
i
should
lose
more
than
three
days
in
finding
a
substitute
and
i
think
you
will
do
the
work
as
i
want
it
done
and
supposing
i
ca
do
it
in
time
will
you
do
your
best
that
all
certainly
whatever
i
do
i
shall
do
my
best
and
if
i
fail
you
left
unfinished
hanging
in
mid
air
the
phrase
suggested
the
vague
phantasmal
contingencies
for
which
he
could
find
no
name
i
am
willing
to
take
the
risk
her
phrase
too
was
satisfying
its
generous
amplitude
covered
him
like
a
cloak
but
we
have
arranged
anything
about
terms
no
they
had
not
was
it
in
her
adorable
simplicity
or
in
the
mere
recklessness
of
her
youth
that
she
engaged
him
first
and
talked
about
terms
afterwards
or
did
she
know
an
honest
man
when
she
saw
one
he
took
his
and
pencil
and
made
out
an
estimate
with
the
rapidity
of
happy
inspiration
a
fantastic
estimate
incredibly
and
ludicrously
small
then
said
she
there
will
be
your
expenses
he
had
not
thought
of
that
difficulty
but
he
soared
above
it
still
reckless
and
inspired
expenses
oh
expenses
are
included
she
considered
the
estimate
with
the
prettiest
pucker
of
her
meditative
brows
i
do
understand
these
things
but
it
seems
very
little
our
usual
charge
so
swiftly
did
the
wings
of
his
inspiration
carry
him
into
the
blue
ideal
high
above
both
verbal
verity
and
the
gross
material
fact
she
acquiesced
though
with
some
reluctance
well
and
when
do
you
think
you
can
begin
whenever
it
most
convenient
to
you
i
shall
have
to
take
a
look
round
first
you
can
do
that
at
once
by
this
time
he
had
forgotten
that
whatever
he
might
have
drunk
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
dinner
of
last
night
he
had
ceased
to
feel
faint
and
headachy
and
hungry
having
reached
that
stage
of
faintness
headache
and
hunger
when
the
body
sheds
its
weight
and
seems
to
walk
gloriously
upon
air
to
be
possessed
of
supernatural
energy
he
went
up
and
down
library
steps
that
were
ladders
and
stood
perilously
on
the
tops
of
them
he
walked
round
and
round
the
walls
making
calculations
till
the
library
began
to
swing
slowly
round
too
and
a
thin
circle
of
grey
mist
swung
with
it
and
all
the
time
he
was
obscurely
aware
of
a
delicate
figure
going
to
and
fro
in
the
grey
mist
or
seated
intent
at
the
table
doing
his
work
he
felt
that
her
eyes
followed
him
now
and
then
heroism
sustained
him
for
an
hour
at
the
end
of
the
hour
his
progress
round
the
room
grew
slower
and
in
passing
by
the
table
where
she
sat
he
had
to
steady
himself
with
one
hand
a
cold
sweat
broke
on
his
forehead
he
mopped
it
furtively
he
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
his
appearance
was
repulsive
and
in
the
same
painful
instant
in
which
this
conviction
sank
into
him
she
raised
her
head
and
he
saw
that
she
was
beautiful
the
upward
look
revealed
her
it
was
as
if
some
veil
soft
but
obscuring
had
dropped
from
her
face
as
her
eyes
scanned
him
gently
it
occurred
to
him
that
she
had
probably
never
before
had
an
opportunity
of
intimately
observing
a
gentleman
suffering
from
the
remoter
effects
of
intoxication
you
look
tired
she
said
or
are
you
ill
he
stood
before
her
for
her
eyes
were
more
disconcerting
than
when
they
had
looked
down
on
him
from
their
height
they
were
tranquil
now
full
of
kind
thought
and
innocence
and
candour
of
innocence
above
all
a
luminous
innocence
a
piercing
purity
he
was
troubled
by
her
presence
but
it
was
not
so
much
her
womanhood
that
troubled
him
as
the
deep
mystery
of
her
youth
he
could
not
look
at
it
as
it
looked
at
him
for
in
looking
at
it
he
remembered
last
night
and
many
nights
before
somehow
it
made
him
see
the
things
it
could
not
see
his
drunkenness
his
folly
his
passion
the
villainous
naked
body
of
his
sin
and
it
was
for
their
work
and
their
marks
upon
him
that
she
pitied
him
have
you
had
anything
to
said
she
oh
yes
thanks
he
answered
vaguely
when
well
as
far
as
i
can
remember
it
was
about
eight
last
night
oh
how
very
thoughtless
of
me
i
am
so
sorry
it
my
own
fault
entirely
i
would
have
mentioned
it
except
to
account
for
my
stupidity
she
crossed
the
room
with
a
quick
movement
of
distress
and
rang
the
bell
with
horror
he
perceived
her
hospitable
intention
she
was
actually
ordering
his
dinner
and
his
room
he
heard
every
word
of
her
soft
voice
it
was
saying
that
he
was
to
have
some
soup
and
the
chicken
and
the
tart
no
the
jelly
and
a
bottle
of
burgundy
in
the
he
saw
the
young
footman
standing
almost
on
winged
for
service
fired
with
her
enthusiasm
and
her
secrecy
coming
on
that
sinister
and
ambiguous
errand
how
could
he
sleep
under
her
roof
how
could
he
eat
her
chicken
and
drink
her
burgundy
and
sit
in
her
and
how
could
he
explain
that
he
could
not
happily
she
left
him
to
settle
the
point
with
the
footman
with
surprise
and
a
little
concern
lucia
harden
learnt
that
the
rather
extraordinary
young
man
savage
keith
rickman
had
betaken
himself
to
an
hotel
it
appeared
that
courteously
but
with
an
earnestness
that
admitted
of
no
contradiction
he
had
declined
all
hospitality
whatever
chapter
xv
it
was
friday
morning
and
rickman
lay
in
bed
outwardly
beholding
through
the
open
window
the
divinity
of
the
sea
inwardly
contemplating
the
phantoms
of
the
mind
for
he
judged
them
to
be
phantoms
alcoholic
in
their
origin
his
scruples
of
last
night
strictly
speaking
it
was
on
wednesday
night
that
he
had
got
drunk
but
he
felt
as
if
his
intoxication
had
prolonged
itself
abnormally
as
if
this
were
the
first
moment
of
indubitable
sobriety
and
as
he
lay
there
he
prepared
himself
to
act
the
part
of
the
cold
abstracted
supercilious
man
of
business
the
part
already
too
horribly
familiar
to
him
as
young
rickman
of
rickman
he
reflected
how
nearly
he
had
wrecked
his
prospects
in
that
character
he
bade
himself
beware
of
woman
and
of
drink
the
two
things
most
fatal
to
stability
of
judgement
he
recalled
painfully
the
events
of
last
evening
he
was
not
quite
sure
what
he
had
done
or
had
done
but
he
believed
he
had
all
but
flung
up
the
chance
of
securing
for
rickman
the
great
harden
library
and
he
had
quite
a
vivid
and
disturbing
recollection
of
the
face
the
person
that
had
inspired
him
with
that
impulse
of
fantastic
folly
in
the
candid
light
of
morning
this
view
of
his
conduct
presented
itself
as
the
sane
thinking
of
a
regenerated
intellect
he
realized
as
he
had
not
realized
before
how
colossal
was
the
opportunity
he
had
so
narrowly
let
slip
the
great
harden
library
would
come
virgin
into
the
market
undefiled
by
the
touch
of
commerce
the
breath
of
publicity
it
had
been
the
pure
and
solitary
delight
of
scholar
lovers
who
would
have
been
insulted
by
the
suggestion
that
they
should
traffic
in
its
treasures
everything
depended
on
his
keeping
its
secret
inviolate
heavens
supposing
he
had
backed
out
of
that
catalogue
and
miss
harden
had
called
in
another
expert
at
this
point
he
detected
in
himself
a
tendency
to
wander
from
the
matter
in
hand
he
reminded
himself
that
whatever
else
he
was
there
for
he
was
there
to
guard
the
virginal
seclusion
of
the
aldine
plato
the
neapolitan
horace
and
the
of
wynkyn
de
worde
he
tried
to
shut
his
eyes
against
his
vivid
and
disturbing
vision
of
the
lady
of
the
library
it
suggested
that
he
was
allowing
that
innocent
person
to
pay
fifteen
pounds
for
a
catalogue
which
he
had
some
reason
to
believe
would
be
of
no
earthly
use
to
her
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
silenced
its
suggestions
with
all
the
gravity
of
his
official
character
if
the
young
lady
insisted
on
having
a
catalogue
made
he
might
as
well
make
it
as
any
one
else
in
fact
a
great
deal
better
he
tried
to
make
himself
believe
that
he
regretted
having
charged
her
fifteen
pounds
when
he
might
have
got
fifty
it
was
more
than
it
was
even
for
him
an
incredibly
idiotic
thing
to
do
he
would
never
have
done
it
if
he
had
not
been
hopelessly
drunk
the
night
before
he
got
out
of
bed
with
a
certain
slow
dignity
and
stepped
into
his
cold
bath
solemnly
as
into
a
font
of
regeneration
and
as
he
bathed
he
still
rehearsed
with
brilliance
his
appointed
part
no
criticism
of
the
performance
was
offered
by
his
actual
self
as
revealed
to
him
in
the
it
stared
at
him
with
an
abstracted
air
conspicuous
in
the
helpless
pathos
of
its
nakedness
it
affected
absorption
in
the
intricate
evolutions
of
the
bath
something
in
its
manner
inspired
him
with
a
vague
distrust
he
noticed
that
this
morning
it
soaped
itself
with
a
peculiar
care
that
it
displayed
more
than
usual
interest
in
the
trivial
details
of
dress
it
rejected
an
otherwise
irreproachable
shirt
because
of
a
minute
wine
stain
on
the
cuff
it
sniffed
critically
at
its
coat
and
trousers
and
flung
them
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
it
arrayed
itself
finally
in
a
suit
of
grey
flannel
altogether
inexpressive
of
his
rôle
he
could
not
but
feel
that
its
behaviour
compromised
the
dignity
of
the
character
he
had
determined
to
represent
it
is
not
in
his
best
coat
and
trousers
that
the
sets
out
on
the
dusty
quest
of
the
aldine
plato
and
the
neapolitan
horace
and
the
of
wynkyn
de
worde
he
could
no
longer
conceal
the
fact
that
he
had
dressed
himself
elaborately
for
an
interview
with
miss
harden
but
he
endeavoured
to
adjust
his
mind
to
a
new
and
less
disturbing
view
of
the
lady
he
had
seen
her
last
night
through
a
flush
of
emotion
that
obscured
her
he
would
see
her
in
the
pure
and
imperturbable
light
of
the
morning
and
his
nerves
should
not
play
the
devil
with
him
this
time
he
would
be
cool
calm
incorruptibly
impersonal
as
became
rickman
the
man
of
business
rickman
of
rickman
unfortunately
though
the
rôle
was
rehearsed
with
ease
in
the
privacy
of
his
bedroom
it
proved
impossible
to
sustain
it
under
miss
candid
eyes
at
the
first
sight
of
them
he
lost
all
grasp
and
memory
of
his
part
he
broke
down
disgracefully
miserably
the
sound
of
her
voice
revived
his
agony
of
the
previous
night
true
the
flush
of
emotion
had
subsided
but
in
the
fierce
intellectual
light
that
followed
his
doubts
and
scruples
showed
plainer
than
ever
they
even
acquired
a
certain
logical
order
and
cohesion
he
concealed
himself
behind
the
projecting
wing
of
a
bookcase
and
wrestled
with
them
there
dispassionately
considered
the
situation
stood
thus
he
was
possessed
of
certain
knowledge
relating
to
sir
frederick
harden
affairs
that
was
neither
bad
nor
good
he
had
allowed
sir
frederick
harden
daughter
to
engage
him
in
a
certain
capacity
knowing
perfectly
well
that
she
would
not
have
done
so
had
she
herself
possessed
that
knowledge
that
was
bad
distinctly
bad
he
was
going
to
take
advantage
of
that
engagement
to
act
in
another
capacity
not
contemplated
by
his
employer
namely
as
valuer
of
said
employer
property
and
possibly
as
the
agent
for
its
purchase
well
knowing
that
such
purchase
would
be
effected
without
reference
to
its
intrinsic
or
even
to
its
market
value
that
was
worse
these
were
the
simple
data
of
his
problem
the
problem
seen
with
excruciating
lucidity
stated
itself
thus
assuming
first
of
all
miss
harden
ignorance
and
his
own
knowledge
what
was
the
correct
attitude
of
his
knowledge
to
her
ignorance
in
other
words
was
it
his
business
to
enlighten
her
as
to
the
state
of
her
father
finances
no
it
might
be
somebody
else
business
but
most
decidedly
it
was
not
his
his
business
as
far
as
he
could
see
it
was
simply
to
withdraw
as
gracefully
as
possible
from
a
position
so
difficult
to
occupy
with
any
decency
he
must
then
make
another
attempt
to
back
out
of
it
no
doubt
it
would
be
an
uncommonly
awkward
thing
to
do
the
lady
had
already
shown
a
very
pretty
little
will
of
her
own
and
supposing
she
insisted
on
holding
him
to
his
bargain
there
was
that
estimate
too
it
seemed
to
have
clinched
things
somehow
between
him
and
miss
harden
he
did
not
exactly
know
how
to
deal
with
that
innocence
but
he
would
ask
her
to
allow
him
to
it
he
approached
her
with
his
head
tossed
up
a
little
more
than
usual
his
way
when
he
was
about
to
do
something
disagreeable
to
drive
a
bargain
or
to
ask
a
favour
miss
harden
may
i
speak
to
you
one
moment
she
looked
up
her
face
and
figure
were
radiant
in
the
light
from
the
south
window
what
is
it
she
asked
she
was
busy
at
one
of
the
bookcases
with
a
and
pencil
cataloguing
on
an
absurd
but
independent
plan
of
her
own
he
gave
a
rueful
glance
at
her
i
not
sure
that
i
ought
to
have
let
you
engage
me
last
night
i
wonder
if
i
might
ask
you
to
release
you
from
your
engagement
you
must
think
i
behaving
very
badly
she
did
not
contradict
him
neither
did
she
assent
she
held
him
for
the
moment
under
her
long
penetrating
gaze
her
eyes
were
not
of
the
detective
sort
quick
to
penetrate
disguises
they
were
though
she
did
not
know
it
eyes
that
possessed
the
power
of
spiritual
seduction
luring
souls
to
confession
your
falseness
might
escape
them
but
if
there
was
any
truth
in
you
she
compelled
you
to
be
true
she
compelled
rickman
to
be
impulsive
i
give
anything
to
know
what
i
ought
to
do
she
did
not
help
him
out
i
ca
make
up
my
mind
about
this
work
is
it
the
question
of
time
i
thought
we
had
made
that
clear
you
did
undertake
to
finish
by
the
the
question
is
whether
i
should
have
undertaken
it
at
all
it
might
have
been
as
well
to
have
answered
that
question
first
i
could
answer
it
there
were
so
many
things
do
you
want
a
longer
time
in
town
i
want
a
longer
time
here
to
think
it
over
to
make
up
my
mind
whether
i
can
go
on
and
in
the
meanwhile
the
work
goes
on
just
the
same
and
if
you
decide
that
you
ca
continue
it
i
should
find
a
substitute
the
substitute
might
not
be
just
the
same
for
instance
he
might
not
have
so
scrupulous
a
conscience
you
mean
he
might
not
be
so
eager
to
back
out
of
his
engagements
i
mean
what
i
said
your
position
seems
to
be
a
little
difficult
i
wish
to
goodness
miss
harden
i
could
explain
it
i
do
suggest
that
you
should
explain
it
it
does
seem
to
be
so
very
clear
to
yourself
it
is
i
really
know
what
i
ought
to
do
no
more
do
i
but
i
can
tell
you
what
you
ought
to
have
done
you
ought
to
have
made
up
your
mind
last
night
well
the
fact
is
last
night
i
had
very
much
mind
left
to
make
up
no
i
remember
you
rather
done
up
i
do
want
to
bind
you
by
last
night
if
it
at
all
unfair
to
you
it
is
in
the
least
unfair
to
me
but
i
not
sure
that
it
be
very
unfair
to
you
and
you
see
i
want
to
think
it
out
very
well
think
it
out
and
let
me
know
some
time
will
that
satisfy
you
it
ought
to
and
for
the
moment
it
did
satisfy
him
he
felt
that
conscience
that
stern
guardian
of
his
conduct
was
off
duty
for
the
day
he
was
free
for
the
day
to
abandon
himself
to
the
charm
of
miss
society
the
experience
he
told
himself
would
be
altogether
new
and
delightful
new
it
undoubtedly
was
but
he
remained
a
little
uncertain
as
to
the
delight
the
immediate
effect
of
miss
harden
presence
being
an
intellectual
disturbance
amounting
almost
to
aberration
it
showed
itself
first
of
all
in
a
frightful
exaltation
of
the
consciousness
of
self
to
rickman
striving
to
be
noiseless
it
seemed
that
the
sound
of
his
boots
as
he
crossed
the
library
reverberated
through
the
immensity
of
space
while
the
creaking
of
his
new
braces
advertised
in
the
most
horrible
manner
his
rising
up
and
his
sitting
down
things
were
worse
when
he
sat
down
for
then
his
breathing
light
but
noticeably
frequent
made
him
the
unquiet
centre
of
the
room
in
the
surrounding
stillness
the
blowing
of
his
nose
became
a
monstrous
and
appalling
act
and
no
sooner
was
his
attention
abstracted
from
his
nose
than
it
settled
in
his
throat
producing
a
series
of
spasmodic
contractions
which
he
imagined
to
be
distinctly
audible
it
was
really
as
if
his
body
had
somehow
detached
itself
and
was
rioting
in
a
conspicuous
and
unseemly
individuality
of
its
own
he
wondered
what
miss
harden
thought
of
its
behaviour
this
state
of
things
was
bad
enough
when
he
was
separated
from
her
by
the
entire
length
of
the
room
but
their
work
required
a
certain
collaboration
and
there
were
occasions
when
he
was
established
near
her
when
deliberately
in
cold
blood
and
of
his
own
initiative
he
was
compelled
to
speak
to
her
no
language
could
describe
the
anguish
and
difficulty
of
these
approaches
his
way
was
beset
by
obstacles
and
perils
by
traps
and
snares
and
at
every
turn
there
waited
for
him
the
shameful
pitfall
of
the
aitch
he
whose
easy
courtesy
charmed
away
the
shyness
of
miss
flossie
walker
whose
conversation
when
he
deigned
to
converse
was
the
wonder
and
delight
of
the
ladies
of
his
now
blushed
to
hear
himself
speak
the
tones
of
his
voice
were
hateful
to
him
he
detected
in
them
some
subtle
and
abominable
quality
that
he
had
not
observed
before
how
would
they
appeal
to
miss
harden
for
this
miserable
consciousness
of
himself
was
pervaded
transcended
by
his
consciousness
of
her
of
her
beauty
he
grew
every
minute
more
aware
it
was
not
of
the
conspicuous
and
conquering
kind
it
carried
no
flaming
banner
of
triumphant
sex
indeed
it
demanded
a
kindred
fineness
of
perception
to
discern
it
being
yet
vague
with
the
softness
of
her
youth
her
hair
was
mere
darkness
without
colour
or
flame
her
face
mere
whiteness
without
a
flush
all
her
colour
and
her
light
were
where
her
soul
was
in
her
mouth
and
eyes
these
showed
more
vivid
for
that
toneless
setting
they
dominated
her
face
however
he
looked
at
her
his
gaze
was
led
up
to
them
for
the
long
dim
lines
of
her
body
flowed
upwards
from
her
feet
like
the
curves
of
a
slender
flame
mingling
aspiring
vanishing
the
edges
of
her
features
were
indistinct
as
the
edges
of
a
flame
this
effect
of
an
upward
sweep
was
repeated
in
the
tilt
of
her
vivid
mouth
and
emphasised
by
the
arch
of
her
eyebrows
giving
a
faintly
interrogative
expression
to
her
face
all
this
he
noticed
he
noticed
everything
about
her
from
the
fine
curling
edges
of
her
mouth
and
the
flawless
rim
of
her
ears
to
her
and
the
slope
of
her
small
imperious
feet
he
caught
every
inflection
of
her
voice
without
looking
at
her
he
was
aware
of
every
turn
of
her
head
every
movement
of
her
eyelids
he
watched
with
furtive
interest
her
way
of
touching
and
handling
things
of
rising
and
sitting
of
walking
and
being
still
it
was
a
new
way
unlike
poppy
way
or
flossie
way
or
the
way
of
any
woman
he
had
yet
seen
what
struck
him
most
was
the
intense
quiet
of
her
presence
it
was
this
that
made
his
own
so
noisy
and
obtrusive
and
yet
she
did
she
really
did
appear
to
notice
it
she
might
have
been
unaware
that
there
was
any
such
person
as
savage
keith
rickman
in
the
room
he
wondered
how
on
earth
she
achieved
that
serene
unconsciousness
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
not
her
own
achievement
at
all
but
the
achievement
of
her
race
theirs
too
that
something
subtly
imperious
in
her
bearing
which
seemed
not
so
much
the
attitude
of
her
mind
as
the
way
her
head
was
set
on
her
shoulders
he
could
not
say
that
she
betrayed
any
sense
of
his
social
inferiority
unless
it
were
in
a
certain
courtesy
which
he
gathered
to
be
rather
more
finished
than
any
she
would
have
shown
to
a
man
of
her
own
class
it
was
not
only
finished
it
was
final
the
thing
was
so
perfect
in
itself
that
obviously
it
could
lead
no
further
she
would
say
in
her
exquisite
voice
would
you
mind
taking
these
five
volumes
back
to
your
shelf
or
i
sorry
to
interrupt
you
but
can
you
tell
me
whether
this
is
the
original
binding
under
no
circumstances
could
he
imagine
himself
replying
i
would
mind
taking
fifty
volumes
or
i
like
being
interrupted
all
this
was
a
complete
inversion
of
the
rules
that
keith
rickman
was
acquainted
with
as
governing
polite
intercourse
between
the
sexes
and
he
found
it
extremely
disconcerting
it
was
as
if
some
fine
but
untransparent
veil
had
been
hung
between
him
and
her
dividing
them
more
effectually
than
a
barricade
the
wonder
which
grew
with
the
morning
was
not
so
much
in
the
things
she
said
as
in
the
things
she
did
say
her
powers
of
reservation
seemed
to
rickman
little
short
of
miraculous
until
yesterday
he
had
never
met
a
woman
who
did
not
by
some
look
or
tone
or
movement
of
her
body
reveal
what
she
was
thinking
about
him
whatever
miss
harden
thought
about
him
she
kept
it
to
herself
unfortunately
the
same
high
degree
of
reticence
was
expected
from
him
and
to
keith
rickman
when
not
restrained
by
excess
of
shyness
reticence
came
hard
it
was
apt
to
break
down
when
a
severe
strain
was
put
on
it
as
had
been
the
case
that
morning
and
it
was
appointed
that
the
same
thing
should
happen
to
him
this
afternoon
as
far
as
he
could
remember
it
happened
in
this
way
he
was
busy
getting
the
greek
dramatists
into
their
places
an
enterprise
which
frequently
took
him
to
her
end
of
the
room
where
sir
joseph
had
established
his
classical
library
he
was
sitting
on
the
top
of
the
steps
when
she
approached
him
carrying
six
vellum
bound
volumes
in
her
arms
sir
joseph
edition
of
euripides
of
which
the
notes
exceeded
the
text
he
dismounted
and
took
the
books
from
her
turning
very
red
as
he
did
so
you
should
let
me
do
all
the
carrying
these
books
are
too
heavy
for
you
thank
you
i
think
they
ought
to
go
with
the
others
on
this
shelf
he
did
not
answer
all
at
once
he
was
absorbed
in
the
euripides
it
was
an
de
the
greek
text
exquisitely
printed
from
a
fount
of
type
the
special
glory
of
the
harden
classics
he
exclaimed
what
magnificent
type
she
smiled
it
rare
too
i
never
seen
any
other
specimen
in
modern
printing
there
is
no
other
specimen
said
she
yes
there
is
one
book
at
least
printed
i
think
in
germany
is
there
it
was
set
up
from
a
new
fount
specially
made
for
this
edition
i
always
supposed
my
grandfather
invented
it
oh
no
he
could
have
done
that
he
may
have
adapted
it
in
fact
he
must
have
adapted
it
this
young
man
had
set
aside
a
cherished
tradition
as
lightly
as
if
he
were
blowing
the
dust
off
the
leaves
she
was
interested
how
can
you
tell
that
oh
i
know
it
very
like
a
manuscript
in
the
british
museum
what
manuscript
the
greek
text
of
the
complutensian
polyglot
he
could
not
help
saying
to
himself
ought
to
fetch
her
but
it
does
follow
that
it
the
same
type
whatever
it
is
it
very
beautiful
it
easier
to
read
too
than
the
ordinary
kind
he
was
still
turning
over
the
pages
handling
the
book
as
a
lover
handles
the
thing
he
loves
the
very
touch
of
the
vellum
thrilled
him
with
an
almost
sensual
rapture
here
and
there
a
line
flashed
from
a
chorus
and
lured
him
deeper
into
the
text
his
impulse
was
still
to
exclaim
but
a
finer
instinct
taught
him
to
suppress
his
scholarly
emotion
looking
up
as
she
spoke
he
saw
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
with
a
curious
sympathy
and
as
he
thought
of
the
possible
destiny
of
the
euripides
he
felt
guilty
as
of
a
treachery
towards
her
in
loving
the
same
book
do
you
read
euripides
he
asked
with
naïve
wonder
yes
and
æschylus
and
sophocles
and
aristoph
rickman
became
embarrassed
as
he
recalled
certain
curious
passages
and
in
his
embarrassment
he
rushed
upon
his
doom
and
and
it
was
a
breakdown
unparalleled
in
his
history
never
since
his
childhood
had
he
neglected
the
aspirate
in
homer
a
flush
made
manifest
his
agony
he
frowned
and
gazed
at
her
steadily
as
if
he
defied
her
to
judge
him
by
that
lapse
yes
said
the
lady
but
she
was
not
thinking
of
homer
by
jove
he
murmured
pensively
his
eyes
turned
from
her
and
devoured
the
text
he
was
torn
between
abject
admiration
of
the
lady
and
of
the
book
which
do
you
like
best
he
asked
suddenly
æschylus
or
sophocles
but
it
an
absurd
question
why
absurd
because
they
so
different
are
they
to
tell
the
truth
she
was
not
thinking
of
them
any
more
than
she
had
been
thinking
of
homer
he
became
perfectly
hectic
with
excitement
rather
ca
you
see
the
difference
sophocles
carved
his
tragedies
he
carved
them
in
ivory
polished
them
up
back
and
front
till
you
ca
see
the
marks
of
the
chisel
and
æschylus
jabbed
his
out
of
the
naked
granite
where
it
stood
and
left
them
there
with
the
sea
at
their
feet
and
the
mist
round
their
heads
and
the
fire
at
their
hearts
but
but
he
left
the
edges
a
little
rough
he
did
god
leaves
them
so
sometimes
when
he
making
a
big
thing
something
like
a
faint
ripple
of
light
passed
over
her
face
under
the
obscuring
veil
it
wore
for
him
but
sophocles
is
perfect
said
she
she
was
not
thinking
of
sophocles
one
bit
she
was
thinking
that
when
god
made
rickman
he
had
left
the
edges
rough
and
wondering
whether
it
was
possible
that
he
had
made
a
big
thing
oh
yes
he
perfect
he
began
to
quote
softly
and
fluently
to
her
uttermost
surprise
his
english
was
at
times
a
thing
to
shudder
at
but
his
greek
was
irreproachable
perfect
in
its
modulation
and
its
flow
freed
from
all
flaws
of
accent
the
musical
quality
of
his
voice
declared
itself
indubitably
marvellously
pure
the
veil
lifted
her
smile
was
a
flash
of
intelligence
the
sexless
impersonal
intelligence
of
the
scholar
this
maker
of
catalogues
with
the
tripping
tongue
that
greek
made
golden
he
had
touched
the
electric
chain
that
linked
them
under
the
deep
under
the
social
gulf
did
you
ever
hear
such
a
chorus
pure
liquid
gold
every
line
of
it
still
you
can
read
sophocles
with
your
hair
on
i
should
have
thought
most
worn
most
ladies
would
like
euripides
best
why
because
they
understand
him
best
no
because
he
understood
them
best
did
he
understand
them
euripides
said
the
young
lady
with
decision
was
a
decadent
was
he
how
about
the
of
course
it
worth
all
the
rest
of
his
plays
put
together
they
not
in
the
same
street
with
it
it
a
thing
to
dream
about
to
go
mad
about
my
grandfather
says
it
not
euripidean
good
lord
how
do
we
know
it
is
the
most
euripidean
of
the
lot
well
it
stands
alone
does
it
yes
and
he
stands
with
it
does
he
my
grandfather
was
judging
him
by
his
average
his
average
oh
i
say
you
know
you
could
reduce
some
very
great
poets
to
mediocrity
by
striking
their
average
would
you
allow
a
man
to
be
at
least
as
great
as
his
greatest
achievement
i
wonder
anyhow
those
are
ripping
good
notes
in
that
edition
they
ought
to
be
they
were
by
a
good
scholar
his
greatest
achievement
he
put
down
the
harden
euripides
and
it
struck
lucia
that
if
sir
joseph
had
been
there
this
truthful
young
man
would
not
have
hesitated
to
put
him
down
too
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
book
with
an
air
of
possession
and
protection
which
was
a
lesson
in
tact
for
the
truthful
young
man
he
leaned
up
against
the
bookcase
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
i
say
said
he
i
hope
you
do
mind
my
talking
like
this
to
you
no
why
should
you
well
it
is
exactly
what
i
here
for
that
exciting
conversation
had
lasted
barely
fifteen
minutes
but
it
had
set
him
for
the
time
being
at
his
ease
he
had
at
any
rate
proved
himself
a
scholar
and
he
was
so
far
happier
he
felt
that
he
was
beginning
to
get
on
with
miss
harden
to
see
a
little
way
across
the
gulf
discerning
the
outlines
of
the
further
shore
where
that
high
lady
walked
unveiled
then
suddenly
owing
to
a
most
humiliating
incident
the
gulf
yawned
again
it
was
five
and
he
was
left
alone
in
the
company
of
a
fascinating
little
laid
as
if
for
a
guest
with
fine
white
linen
silk
embroidered
with
early
georgian
silver
and
old
china
it
was
laid
for
him
that
little
he
had
delayed
a
little
before
beginning
his
repast
and
it
happened
that
when
miss
harden
appeared
again
she
found
him
holding
a
to
his
lips
with
one
hand
while
the
other
groped
in
a
dish
of
cream
cakes
abstractedly
and
without
the
guidance
of
a
selective
eye
both
eyes
indeed
were
gazing
dreamily
over
the
rim
of
the
at
her
empty
chair
he
was
all
right
so
why
oh
why
did
he
turn
and
dash
his
cup
down
and
draw
back
his
innocent
hand
that
was
what
he
had
seen
the
errand
boy
at
rickman
do
when
he
caught
him
eating
lunch
in
a
dark
passage
he
always
had
compassion
on
that
poor
pariah
and
left
him
to
finish
his
meal
in
privacy
and
with
the
same
delicacy
miss
harden
perceiving
his
agony
withdrew
he
was
aware
that
the
incident
had
marked
him
he
stood
exactly
where
he
stood
before
expert
knowledge
was
nothing
mere
conversational
dexterity
was
nothing
he
could
talk
to
her
about
euripides
and
sophocles
till
all
was
blue
he
could
not
blow
his
nose
before
her
or
eat
and
drink
before
her
like
a
gentleman
without
shame
and
fear
they
talked
no
more
that
evening
chapter
xvi
at
seven
he
again
refused
miss
harden
hospitality
and
withdrew
to
his
hotel
he
was
to
return
before
nine
to
let
her
know
his
decision
and
as
yet
he
had
done
nothing
towards
thinking
it
out
a
letter
had
come
for
him
by
the
evening
post
it
had
been
forwarded
from
his
rooms
and
ran
thus
my
dear
rickets
i
have
forgotten
about
your
little
supper
so
mind
you
turn
up
at
our
little
before
dicky
drinks

the
champagne

going
to
be
awfully
select

your
own
and
nobody
else
poppy
grace
how
is
your
poor
head
there
are
many
ways
of
being
kind
and
that
was
poppy
way
she
wanted
to
tell
him
not
to
be
cut
up
about
wednesday
night
that
whatever
dicky
pilkington
thought
of
his
pretensions
she
still
reckoned
him
in
the
number
of
the
awfully
select
and
lest
he
should
have
deeper
grounds
for
uneasiness
her
postscript
hinted
in
the
most
delicate
manner
possible
that
she
had
not
taken
him
seriously
attributing
his
utterances
to
their
true
cause
and
yet
she
was
his
own
and
nobody
else
she
was
a
good
sort
poppy
taking
her
all
round
he
tried
to
think
about
poppy
and
found
it
difficult
his
mind
wandered
not
into
the
realms
of
fancy
but
into
paths
strange
and
humiliating
for
a
scholar
and
a
poet
he
caught
himself
murmuring
harmouth
harcombe
homer
harden
he
had
got
them
all
right
he
never
dreamed
of
of
dropping
them
when
he
was
excited
it
was
only
in
the
beaten
tracks
where
his
father
had
gone
before
him
that
he
was
apt
to
slide
he
was
triumphant
over
harmouth
where
he
might
have
tripped
over
hammersmith
homer
and
hesiod
were
as
safe
with
him
as
with
horace
jewdwine
he
could
think
how
he
had
managed
to
come
to
grief
over
homer
just
now
it
was
nerves
or
luck
or
pure
accident
the
sort
of
thing
that
might
have
happened
to
anybody
thank
heaven
his
tongue
was
almost
virgin
to
the
aitch
in
harden
harden
lucia
harden
he
knew
her
name
and
how
to
pronounce
it
for
he
had
seen
it
written
in
the
of
a
book
and
heard
it
spoken
by
the
footman
who
called
her
miss
loocher
this
he
took
to
be
a
corruption
of
the
italian
form
here
he
again
tried
to
evoke
a
vivid
image
of
poppy
but
without
success
and
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
still
to
think
it
out
first
of
all
then
he
would
eliminate
sentiment
sentiment
apart
he
was
by
no
means
sure
that
he
would
do
well
to
act
on
the
impulse
of
the
morning
and
decamp
after
all
what
he
sure
of
was
he
sure
that
sir
frederick
harden
affairs
including
his
library
were
involved
beyond
redemption
put
it
that
there
was
an
of
sir
frederick
financial
recovery
from
the
bare
uninteresting
financial
point
of
view
that
event
would
entail
some
regrettable
consequences
for
himself
he
had
been
extremely
rash
he
had
undertaken
to
accomplish
three
weeks
expert
work
to
the
value
of
fifty
pounds
for
which
he
had
charged
fifteen
an
estimate
that
at
rickman
would
have
been
considered
ridiculous
for
a
man
bare
time
he
had
not
so
much
as
mentioned
his
fare
he
had
refused
board
and
lodging
and
on
the
most
sanguine
computation
his
fees
would
only
cover
his
expenses
by
about
five
pounds
the
difference
between
fifteen
pounds
and
fifty
would
have
to
be
refunded
out
of
his
own
private
pocket
when
it
came
to
settling
accounts
with
rickman
his
position
would
be
to
say
the
least
of
it
embarrassing
it
was
difficult
to
unravel
the
mental
process
that
had
led
him
into
it
but
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
these
luxurious
subtleties
of
conscience
had
caused
him
to
run
short
of
ready
money
it
was
only
another
of
those
innumerable
occasions
when
he
and
his
father
failed
to
see
face
to
face
and
when
he
had
had
to
pay
for
the
pleasure
of
supporting
a
fantastic
personal
view
only
the
view
in
this
case
was
so
hideously
complicated
and
and
exaggerated
and
this
time
in
order
to
clear
himself
he
would
be
compelled
to
borrow
again
from
dicky
pilkington
there
was
no
other
way
no
sooner
did
sir
frederick
head
appear
rising
above
water
than
he
saw
his
own
hopelessly
submerged
nevertheless
it
was
this
prospect
that
he
found
himself
contemplating
with
all
the
ardour
of
desire
it
justified
not
only
his
presence
in
the
harden
library
but
miss
harden
presence
as
his
collaborator
with
all
its
unpleasantness
it
was
infinitely
preferable
to
the
other
alternative
he
let
his
mind
dwell
on
it
until
the
began
to
look
like
an
absolute
certainty
put
it
then
that
sir
frederick
recovered
in
this
case
the
hardens
scored
since
he
had
charged
miss
harden
fifteen
where
he
was
entitled
to
fifty
the
best
part
of
his
labour
might
be
considered
a
free
gift
to
the
lady
what
was
more
in
the
matter
of
commission
he
stood
to
lose
a
very
considerable
sum
put
it
that
the
chances
were
even
and
the
whole
business
resolved
itself
into
a
game
of
pitch
and
toss
heads
miss
harden
lost
tails
she
won
and
he
was
responsible
for
the
tossing
but
put
it
that
sir
frederick
did
not
recover
then
he
keith
rickman
was
in
a
position
most
unpleasant
for
himself
but
he
could
not
make
things
a
bit
pleasanter
for
miss
harden
by
wriggling
out
of
it
the
library
would
be
sold
whether
he
stayed
there
or
not
and
by
staying
he
might
possibly
protect
her
interests
in
the
sale
it
was
a
nice
thing
to
have
to
be
keeping
his
eye
all
the
time
on
the
aldine
plato
and
the
neapolitan
horace
and
the
of
wynkyn
de
worde
but
he
would
only
be
doing
what
must
be
done
by
somebody
in
any
case
conclusion
however
unpleasant
for
him
to
be
the
agent
for
the
sale
it
would
be
safer
for
miss
harden
and
how
about
those
confounded
profits
represented
by
his
commission
that
was
easily
settled
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
filthy
things
he
would
touch
his
commission
with
the
end
of
the
poker
unfortunately
he
would
never
be
able
to
explain
all
this
to
her
and
heaven
only
knew
what
she
would
think
of
him
when
it
all
came
out
in
the
as
it
was
bound
to
come
well
it
would
matter
what
she
thought
of
him
so
long
as
he
knew
that
his
hands
were
clean
rickman
hands
might
not
be
so
presentable
but
they
were
not
human
hands
as
his
were
they
were
the
iron
irresponsible
hands
of
a
machine
there
remained
his
arrangements
for
the
bank
holiday
they
seemed
to
have
been
made
so
long
ago
that
they
hardly
counted
still
there
was
that
engagement
to
poppy
grace
and
he
had
promised
to
take
poor
flossie
to
the
hippodrome
poor
flossie
would
be
disappointed
if
he
did
not
take
her
to
the
hippodrome
at
the
moment
disappointment
presented
itself
as
considerably
more
vital
than
his
own
then
being
saturday
he
would
go
up
to
town
and
on
monday
he
would
return
to
his
ambiguous
post
he
had
thought
it
out
chapter
xvii
there
a
lot
of
rot
said
rickman
talked
about
greek
tragedy
but
really
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
it
only
in
sophocles
you
get
the
tragedy
of
fate
there
is
any
such
thing
in
æschylus
you
know
he
had
gone
up
to
acquaint
miss
harden
with
his
decision
and
had
been
led
off
into
this
hopeful
track
by
the
seductions
that
still
lurked
in
the
euripides
there
nemesis
which
is
the
same
thing
said
she
not
at
all
the
same
thing
nemesis
is
simply
the
horrid
jealousy
of
the
gods
and
the
responsibility
lies
with
the
person
who
provokes
them
whether
it
prometheus
or
agamemnon
or
agamemnon
great
great
grandfather
it
the
tragedy
of
human
responsibility
the
most
brutal
tragedy
of
all
all
these
people
are
crumpled
up
with
it
they
go
about
tearing
their
hair
over
it
and
howling
out
greek
drasanti
pathein
there
is
any
fate
in
that
you
know
is
there
he
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
in
sophocles
now
it
all
the
other
way
about
his
people
responsible
in
the
least
they
just
a
thundering
lot
of
lunatics
they
go
knocking
their
poor
heads
against
the
divine
law
and
trying
to
see
which
is
the
hardest
till
they
end
by
breaking
both
no
question
of
paying
for
the
damage
it
pure
fate
well
and
euripides
oh
euripides
goes
on
another
tack
altogether
there
are
any
laws
to
break
yet
everybody
miserable
all
round
and
responsible
it
greek
tô
pathonti
pathein
they
suffer
because
they
suffer
and
there
an
end
of
it
and
it
the
end
of
fate
in
greek
tragedy
i
know
this
is
the
orthodox
view
of
it
he
paused
a
little
out
of
breath
for
he
had
talked
as
usual
against
time
leaving
behind
him
a
luminous
trail
of
ideas
struck
out
furiously
as
he
rushed
along
his
excitement
was
of
the
kind
that
carried
him
triumphantly
over
all
obstacles
even
the
barrier
of
the
aitch
was
she
listening
she
was
but
as
she
listened
she
looked
down
and
her
fingers
played
with
the
slender
gold
chain
that
went
twice
round
her
throat
and
fell
among
the
laces
of
her
gown
on
her
mouth
there
was
the
same
smile
he
had
seen
when
he
first
saw
her
he
took
it
for
a
smile
of
innermost
amusement
it
did
lurk
there
was
nothing
underhand
about
it
it
hovered
delicately
poised
for
flight
euripides
she
said
had
the
deeper
insight
then
he
knew
that
character
is
destiny
that
character
is
destiny
whose
character
for
all
i
know
your
character
may
be
my
destiny
it
was
one
of
those
unconsidered
speeches
flashed
out
in
the
heat
of
argument
which
nevertheless
once
uttered
are
felt
to
be
terrific
and
momentous
he
wondered
how
miss
harden
would
take
it
she
took
it
as
she
seemed
to
take
most
things
calmly
no
character
could
have
any
power
over
you
except
through
your
own
perhaps
not
all
the
same
you
are
not
me
you
are
something
outside
you
would
be
my
destiny
he
paused
again
personalities
were
pitfalls
which
he
must
avoid
no
such
danger
existed
for
the
lady
she
simply
ignored
it
her
mind
never
touched
those
deeper
issues
of
the
discussion
where
his
floundered
perilously
immersed
still
she
was
not
unwilling
to
pursue
the
theme
it
all
depends
said
she
on
what
you
mean
by
destiny
well
say
i
mean
the
end
the
end
i
moving
towards
the
end
i
ultimately
arrive
at
surely
that
depends
on
your
character
your
character
of
course
as
a
whole
it
may
or
may
it
may
depend
on
what
i
eat
or
do
eat
for
dinner
on
the
paper
i
take
in
or
the
pattern
of
my
waistcoat
and
the
end
may
be
utterly
repellent
to
my
character
as
a
whole
say
i
end
by
adopting
an
unsuitable
profession
is
that
my
character
or
my
destiny
your
character
i
think
or
you
would
have
adopted
it
h
supposing
it
adopts
me
it
could
against
your
will
no
but
my
will
in
this
instance
might
not
be
the
expression
of
my
character
as
a
whole
why
i
may
be
doing
violence
to
my
character
as
a
whole
by
by
the
unique
absurdity
that
dishes
me
that
destiny
if
you
like
but
it
not
character
not
my
character
anyhow
personalities
again
whither
could
he
flee
from
their
presence
even
the
frigid
realm
of
abstractions
was
shaken
by
the
beating
of
his
own
passionate
heart
her
eyes
had
the
allurements
of
the
confessional
he
hovered
fascinated
round
the
holy
precincts
for
ever
on
the
brink
of
revelation
it
was
ungovernable
this
tendency
to
talk
about
himself
in
another
minute
but
no
most
decidedly
that
was
not
what
he
was
there
for
if
it
came
to
that
what
he
there
for
it
was
so
incredible
that
he
should
be
there
at
all
and
yet
there
he
was
going
to
stay
for
three
weeks
and
more
he
had
come
to
tell
her
so
miss
harden
received
the
announcement
as
if
it
had
been
a
foregone
conclusion
it
is
settled
then
said
she
you
will
have
no
more
scruples
none
there
only
one
thing
i
must
ask
you
not
to
give
anybody
any
information
about
the
library
we
do
want
to
be
bothered
with
dealers
and
collectors
some
of
the
books
are
so
valuable
that
we
should
never
have
any
peace
if
their
whereabouts
became
known
can
you
keep
the
secret
his
heart
sank
as
he
remembered
the
aldine
plato
and
the
neapolitan
horace
and
the
of
wynkyn
de
worde
but
he
pledged
himself
to
absolute
discretion
an
inviolable
secrecy
why
not
he
was
a
dealer
himself
and
obviously
it
was
his
interest
to
keep
other
dealers
in
the
dark
it
was
an
entirely
sensible
and
pledge
and
yet
in
giving
it
he
felt
that
he
was
committing
himself
to
something
unique
something
profound
and
intimate
and
irrevocable
he
had
burnt
his
ships
severed
himself
body
and
soul
from
rickman
if
it
were
miss
harden
interest
that
he
should
defend
that
secret
from
his
own
father
he
would
have
to
defend
it
he
had
given
his
word
and
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
tell
why
in
the
same
way
he
felt
that
in
spite
of
his
many
ingenious
arguments
his
determination
to
stay
had
in
it
something
mysterious
and
unforeseen
he
had
said
to
her
your
character
may
be
my
destiny
and
perhaps
it
was
he
felt
that
tremendous
issues
hung
upon
his
decision
and
that
all
along
he
had
been
forced
into
it
somehow
from
outside
himself
rather
than
from
within
and
yet
as
he
sat
there
feeling
all
this
while
he
worked
at
the
abominable
catalogue
he
decided
further
that
he
would
not
go
away
at
all
he
would
not
go
back
to
town
he
could
not
afford
the
time
he
must
and
would
finish
that
catalogue
by
the
he
had
as
good
as
pledged
his
word
to
miss
harden
supposing
the
pledge
had
a
purely
ideal
even
fantastic
value
he
was
none
the
less
bound
by
it
in
fact
considerably
more
for
he
and
she
could
only
meet
in
an
ideal
and
fantastic
region
and
he
served
her
in
an
ideal
and
fantastic
capacity
on
the
wholly
ideal
and
fantastic
assumption
that
the
library
was
hers
such
a
pledge
would
he
imagined
be
held
supreme
in
the
world
where
honour
and
miss
harden
met
face
to
face
and
on
him
it
was
conceivably
more
binding
than
the
promise
to
take
flossie
to
the
hippodrome
on
saturday
or
to
intoxicate
himself
on
sunday
with
champagne
in
the
society
of
miss
poppy
grace
its
sovereignty
cancelled
the
priority
of
the
more
trivial
and
the
grosser
claim
his
word
to
miss
harden
was
one
of
those
fine
immortal
things
that
can
only
be
redeemed
at
the
cost
of
the
actual
to
redeem
it
he
was
prepared
for
sacrifice
even
the
sacrifice
of
the
great
three
days
he
worked
late
that
night
and
she
told
him
of
a
short
cut
to
the
town
by
the
river
path
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
to
the
river
he
stopped
and
looked
back
the
beech
tree
dreamed
silent
on
a
slope
of
glimmering
lawn
the
house
loomed
in
the
background
a
grey
mass
with
blurred
outlines
from
a
window
open
in
the
east
wing
he
could
hear
the
sound
of
a
piano
he
stood
still
and
listened
all
around
was
the
tender
indescribable
devonshire
night
it
hung
about
him
with
warm
scented
breath
he
felt
its
heart
beat
in
the
innumerable
pulses
of
the
stars
behind
the
blue
transparent
darkness
the
music
throbbed
like
a
dawn
it
swayed
and
sank
piano
pianissimo
and
streamed
out
again
into
the
night
dividing
the
darkness
it
flowed
on
in
a
tumult
a
tremendous
tumult
rhythmic
and
controlled
what
was
she
playing
if
he
stayed
till
midnight
he
must
hear
it
through
night
sheltered
him
and
he
drew
nearer
lest
he
should
lose
a
note
he
stretched
himself
on
the
lawn
and
with
his
head
on
his
arms
he
lay
under
the
under
the
stars
dreaming
while
lucia
harden
played
to
him
the
sonata
appassionata
it
was
good
to
be
there
but
he
did
not
know
and
the
music
did
not
tell
him
why
he
was
there
and
what
he
was
there
for
and
yet
it
was
the
sonata
appassionata
chapter
xviii
it
was
the
afternoon
of
saturday
the
fourth
that
rickman
looking
up
from
his
table
saw
a
brilliant
apparition
coming
across
the
lawn
he
dreaded
afternoon
callers
he
dreaded
the
post
he
dreaded
every
person
and
every
thing
which
reminded
him
that
lucia
harden
had
a
life
that
he
knew
not
and
that
knew
not
him
lucia
lucia
rickman
looked
up
and
saw
the
brilliant
apparition
standing
in
the
south
window
it
pleaded
you
say
you
out
when
i
can
see
perfectly
well
that
you
in
go
away
kitty
i
busy
you
no
business
to
be
busy
at
five
in
the
afternoon
miss
kitty
palliser
body
was
outside
the
window
but
her
head
crowned
with
a
marvellous
hat
of
parma
violets
was
already
within
the
room
i
dying
of
thirst
she
said
take
me
in
and
be
kind
to
me
and
give
me
tea
lucia
rose
and
went
to
the
window
reluctant
but
resigned
scraps
of
their
conversation
floated
down
to
rickman
end
of
the
room
yes
you
may
well
look
at
my
hat
i
was
looking
at
it
i
was
looking
through
it
well
if
you
can
see
through
my
hat
lucia
you
can
see
through
me
what
do
you
think
of
it
of
the
hat
oh
the
hat
is
a
poem
is
it
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
inspired
so
impassioned
inspired
but
do
you
think
just
a
little
a
little
meaningless
meaningless
it
with
meaning
i
should
like
to
know
what
it
means
if
it
means
nothing
else
it
means
that
i
been
going
to
and
fro
the
whole
blessed
afternoon
paying
calls
in
harmouth
for
my
sins
poor
kitty
the
last
three
times
i
paid
calls
in
harmouth
said
poor
kitty
i
sported
a
cycling
skirt
the
blousiest
of
blouses
and
a
over
my
left
ear
of
course
everybody
was
in
so
i
thought
if
i
went
like
this
brand
new
frock
swagger
hat
white
gloves
that
everybody
would
be
out
and
were
they
no
just
like
my
luck
they
were
all
all
in
and
yet
you
have
the
audacity
to
come
here
and
ask
for
tea
for
goodness
sake
do
talk
of
tea
i
thought
you
were
so
thirsty
so
i
am
i
thirst
for
amusement
kitty
you
been
amusing
yourself
all
afternoon
at
other
expense
yes
it
cheap
awfully
cheap
but
fatiguing
i
do
want
to
amuse
myself
i
want
to
be
amused
rickman
took
a
longer
look
at
the
brilliant
apparition
now
at
a
little
distance
miss
palliser
passed
as
merely
an
ordinary
specimen
of
a
brilliant
but
conventional
type
this
effect
was
an
illusion
produced
by
her
irreproachably
correct
attire
as
she
drew
nearer
it
became
apparent
that
convention
could
never
have
had
very
much
to
do
with
her
tailor
and
milliner
were
responsible
for
the
general
correctness
of
miss
palliser
appearance
miss
palliser
herself
for
the
riot
and
confusion
of
the
details
her
coat
flung
open
displayed
a
tangle
of
laces
disposed
after
her
own
fancy
her
skirts
so
flawless
and
sedate
swept
as
if
inspired
by
the
storm
of
her
impetuous
stride
under
her
too
too
fashionable
hat
her
brown
hair
was
twisted
in
a
way
entirely
her
own
and
fashion
had
left
untouched
the
wild
originality
of
her
face
bumpy
brows
jutting
eyebrows
and
nose
long
in
the
bridge
wide
in
the
nostril
tilted
in
a
gentle
gradient
a
wide
nervous
mouth
and
no
chin
to
speak
of
a
thin
face
lit
by
restless
greenish
eyes
humorous
and
alert
miss
palliser
sent
the
gaze
of
those
eyes
round
the
room
the
hungry
satanic
humour
in
them
roved
seeking
what
it
might
devour
it
fell
upon
rickman
what
have
you
got
there
miss
harden
reply
was
inaudible
let
me
in
i
want
to
look
at
it
do
kitty
apparently
an
explanation
followed
from
miss
harden
it
also
was
inaudible
where
is
miss
roots
please
kitty
do
go
into
the
this
painful
scene
was
cut
short
by
robert
who
announced
that
tea
was
served
oh
joy
said
miss
palliser
and
disappeared
lucia
following
found
her
examining
the
only
two
cups
said
miss
palliser
is
it
going
to
get
any
tea
then
is
what
going
to
get
any
tea
it
the
man
thing
you
keep
in
there
yes
but
it
does
get
it
here
i
think
you
might
ask
it
in
it
might
amuse
me
lucia
ignored
the
suggestion
i
have
talked
said
miss
palliser
to
a
man
thing
for
ages
it
has
come
to
be
talked
to
it
much
too
busy
may
it
come
in
just
for
a
treat
lucia
shook
her
head
what
it
like
is
it
nice
to
look
at
no
yes
no
what
have
you
made
up
your
mind
yet
i
have
thought
about
it
lucia
you
a
perfect
dog
in
the
manger
you
do
care
a
rap
about
the
creature
yourself
and
yet
you
refuse
to
share
it
with
your
friend
i
put
it
to
you
here
we
are
you
and
i
living
in
a
howling
wilderness
untrodden
by
the
foot
of
man
where
even
curates
are
at
a
premium
is
it
right
is
it
fair
of
you
to
have
a
presentable
in
the
house
and
to
keep
it
to
yourself
well
you
see
it
it
is
so
very
presentable
rubbish
i
saw
it
it
looked
perfectly
all
right
that
said
lucia
is
illusion
you
have
heard
it
speak
what
wrong
with
it
nothing
nothing
only
it
is
exactly
what
you
call
a
gentleman
oh
well
i
think
you
might
have
told
me
that
before
i
been
trying
to
tell
you
kitty
reflected
a
moment
so
it
making
a
catalogue
is
it
whose
bright
idea
is
that
it
was
grandpapa
it
mine
now
she
did
not
mention
that
it
was
also
horace
jewdwine
and
what
will
your
little
papa
say
he
wo
say
anything
he
never
does
the
library
mine
mine
to
do
as
i
like
with
you
broken
the
spell
is
there
some
weird
legend
about
women
never
inheriting
it
well
they
never
have
i
shall
be
the
first
i
say
if
i
were
you
i
should
feel
a
little
creepy
i
do
sometimes
that
one
reason
why
i
want
to
get
this
thing
made
in
my
lifetime
before
i
go
away
good
gracious
you
not
going
away
to
die
i
do
know
what
i
going
away
to
do
anyhow
the
catalogue
will
be
done
all
ready
for
horace
when
he
steps
into
my
shoes
unless
happy
thought
you
marry
him
that
i
suppose
is
pair
of
shoes
there
was
a
pause
during
which
miss
palliser
gazed
thoughtfully
at
her
friend
what
have
you
been
doing
to
yourself
you
look
most
awfully
tired
i
been
sitting
up
rather
late
the
last
few
nights
cataloguing
what
on
earth
did
you
do
that
for
because
i
want
to
finish
by
the
there
was
a
pause
while
miss
palliser
ate
is
horace
coming
down
before
you
go
no
he
too
busy
besides
he
never
comes
when
father
is
here
oh
dear
no
he
does
think
it
proper
it
odd
said
miss
palliser
looking
down
at
her
with
an
air
of
profound
philosophic
reflection
you
ca
ask
your
cousin
to
stay
with
you
because
it
improper
but
it
is
improper
to
sit
up
making
catalogues
with
young
till
all
hours
of
the
night
why
should
it
be
improper
for
goodness
sake
do
ask
me
how
should
know
do
you
find
yourself
wishing
sometimes
that
was
mr
jewdwine
more
tea
kitty
rather
i
going
into
the
library
to
choose
a
book
when
finished
my
tea
i
shall
take
the
opportunity
of
observing
for
myself
whether
savage
keith
rickman
good
lord
deliver
us
whether
savage
keith
rickman
is
a
proper
person
for
you
to
know
that
reminds
me
dearest
do
you
know
what
they
talk
about
in
harmouth
they
talk
about
conversation
jiggers
round
you
like
a
silly
moth
round
a
candle
would
you
like
to
know
what
harmouth
thinks
of
you
no
i
have
the
smallest
curiosity
i
shall
tell
you
all
the
same
because
it
good
for
you
to
see
yourself
as
others
see
you
they
say
dear
that
you
do
put
on
such
a
thundering
lot
of
side
they
say
that
attitude
is
absurd
in
one
so
young
they
say
you
ought
to
marry
that
if
you
do
marry
you
possibly
hope
to
keep
it
up
and
they
say
you
never
will
marry
if
you
continue
to
be
so
exclusive
exclusive
was
the
word
but
before
i
left
they
married
you
to
jewdwine
you
see
dear
you
so
exclusive
that
you
bound
to
marry
into
your
own
family
no
other
family
being
good
enough
it
certainly
a
new
light
on
my
character
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
crampton
takes
a
charitable
view
she
says
she
does
believe
you
really
mean
it
dear
she
thinks
that
you
are
only
very
shy
she
has
heard
much
about
you
and
is
to
know
you
do
be
frightened
lucia
i
was
most
discreet
how
did
you
show
your
discretion
i
told
her
not
to
die
i
tried
to
persuade
her
that
she
would
love
you
so
much
if
she
did
know
you
kitty
that
was
very
kind
it
was
the
kindest
thing
i
could
think
of
it
must
soothe
her
to
feel
that
this
exclusiveness
does
imply
any
reflection
on
her
social
position
but
merely
a
weird
unaccountable
dislike
how
is
it
that
some
people
ca
understand
that
your
social
position
is
like
your
digestion
or
the
nose
on
your
face
you
never
aware
of
either
unless
there
something
wrong
with
it
kitty
you
not
in
a
nice
mood
this
afternoon
i
know
i
not
i
been
in
harmouth
lucy
there
are
moments
when
i
loathe
my
poor
things
whatever
have
they
been
doing
now
oh
i
do
know
the
same
old
thing
they
make
my
life
a
burden
to
me
but
how
they
always
bothering
me
always
trying
to
get
at
you
through
me
they
always
asking
me
to
tea
to
meet
people
in
the
hope
that
ask
them
back
to
meet
you
i
worn
out
with
keeping
them
off
you
some
day
all
harmouth
will
come
bursting
into
your
over
my
prostrate
form
flattened
out
upon
the
never
mind
i
would
sweetheart
if
they
really
cared
about
you
but
they
do
if
you
lost
your
money
and
your
social
position
they
would
care
a
rap
that
why
i
hate
them
why
do
you
visit
them
if
you
hate
them
because
as
i
told
you
i
hunger
and
thirst
for
amusement
and
they
do
amuse
me
when
they
do
make
me
dear
kitty
i
sure
they
nicer
than
you
think
most
people
are
you
know
if
you
think
so
why
do
visit
them
snapped
kitty
i
would
if
if
they
ceased
to
be
amusing
if
they
broke
their
legs
or
lost
their
money
or
if
they
got
paralytic
strokes
or
something
you
visit
them
in
their
affliction
but
not
in
the
ordinary
playful
circumstances
of
life
that
because
you
an
angel
said
miss
palliser
sententiously
am
not
why
do
i
always
come
to
you
when
i
feel
most
hopelessly
the
other
thing
lucia
said
something
that
had
a
very
soothing
effect
it
sounded
like
skittles
but
the
word
was
lucy
i
should
be
such
a
bad
sort
if
i
lived
with
you
i
been
here
exactly
twenty
minutes
and
i
laid
in
enough
goodness
to
last
me
for
a
week
and
now
said
miss
palliser
with
decision
going
lucia
looked
up
in
some
trepidation
where
are
you
going
to
i
am
going
to
choose
that
book
oh
kitty
do
be
careful
i
am
always
careful
said
miss
palliser
in
choosing
a
book
in
about
ten
minutes
time
she
returned
her
chastened
mood
had
vanished
lucia
said
she
you
have
an
immense
regard
for
that
young
man
how
do
you
know
that
i
have
an
immense
regard
for
him
i
suppose
you
expect
me
to
say
that
i
can
tell
by
your
manner
i
ca
your
manner
is
perfection
it
by
robert
manner
that
i
judged
robert
manner
is
not
perfection
for
a
footman
you
know
it
a
shade
too
eager
too
emotional
that
to
my
mind
is
the
charm
of
robert
still
there
are
drawbacks
a
footman
face
ought
not
to
betray
the
feelings
of
his
mistress
that
how
i
knew
that
mabel
flosser
was
cooling
off
by
the
increasing
frostiness
of
blundell
i
shall
feel
sure
of
you
lucia
as
long
as
robert
continues
to
struggle
against
his
fascinating
smile
take
my
advice
if
you
should
ever
cherish
a
secret
passion
get
rid
of
robert
for
sure
as
fate
he
give
you
away
perhaps
she
added
meditatively
it
a
little
mean
of
me
kitty
what
have
you
been
up
to
it
was
your
fault
you
should
be
so
mysterious
wishing
to
ascertain
your
real
opinion
of
savage
keith
rickman
i
watched
robert
as
he
was
bringing
in
his
tea
i
hope
he
was
properly
attentive
attentive
is
the
word
for
it
he
may
have
felt
that
my
eye
was
upon
him
and
so
got
flustered
but
it
struck
me
that
he
overdid
the
thing
he
waited
on
rickman
as
if
he
positively
loved
him
that
wo
do
you
know
he
be
raising
fatal
hopes
in
the
bosom
of
the
savage
keith
let
us
hope
that
rickman
is
not
observant
he
is
as
it
happens
excessively
observant
so
i
found
out
i
found
out
all
sorts
of
things
what
things
well
in
the
first
place
that
he
is
conscientious
he
does
waste
time
he
writes
with
one
hand
while
he
takes
his
tea
with
the
other
which
of
course
is
very
clever
of
him
he
marvellously
ambidexterous
so
long
as
he
does
know
you
looking
at
him
unfortunately
my
eye
arrested
him
in
the
double
act
lucy
my
eye
must
have
some
horrible
malignant
power
for
it
instantly
gave
him
vitus
dance
have
you
ever
noticed
anything
peculiar
about
my
eye
what
a
shame
yes
i
afraid
he
have
to
do
a
little
oh
kitty
why
could
you
leave
the
poor
thing
in
peace
there
was
any
peace
to
leave
him
in
really
you
have
thought
that
taking
afternoon
tea
was
an
offence
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
he
could
have
been
more
excited
if
i
caught
him
in
his
bath
rickman
suffers
from
excess
of
modesty
rickman
could
hardly
say
the
same
of
you
you
might
have
had
the
decency
to
go
away
there
would
have
been
any
decency
in
going
away
flight
would
have
argued
that
i
shared
the
theory
of
his
guilt
i
stayed
where
i
was
for
two
seconds
just
to
reassure
him
then
i
went
away
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
you
should
have
gone
away
altogether
why
the
library
is
big
enough
for
two
it
so
big
that
you
could
take
a
bath
or
do
a
murder
at
one
end
without
anybody
being
aware
of
it
at
the
other
i
went
away
i
wandered
round
the
bookcases
i
even
hummed
a
tune
not
so
much
to
show
that
i
was
at
my
ease
as
to
set
him
at
his
in
fact
you
behaved
as
like
a
dreadful
young
person
as
you
possibly
could
i
thought
that
would
set
him
at
his
ease
sooner
than
anything
i
did
it
on
purpose
i
am
nothing
if
not
subtle
would
have
crushed
him
with
a
delicate
and
ladylike
retreat
left
him
as
happy
as
he
could
be
smiling
dreamily
to
himself
over
the
catalogue
and
then
then
i
admit
i
felt
it
might
be
time
to
go
but
before
i
went
i
made
another
discovery
you
know
lucia
he
really
is
rather
nice
to
look
at
adieu
my
exclusive
one
chapter
xix
the
chronicler
who
recorded
that
no
woman
had
ever
inherited
the
harden
library
contented
himself
with
the
bare
statement
of
the
fact
it
was
not
his
business
to
search
into
its
causes
which
belonged
to
the
obscurer
regions
of
psychology
sir
joseph
harden
and
those
who
went
before
him
had
the
incurable
defects
of
their
qualities
hereditary
instinct
working
in
them
with
a
force
as
of
some
blind
fatality
drove
too
many
of
them
to
espouse
their
opposites
their
wives
were
not
expected
to
do
anything
noteworthy
beyond
sitting
for
their
portraits
to
the
masters
of
their
day
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
many
of
them
contrived
to
achieve
a
far
less
enviable
distinction
the
portraits
have
immortalized
their
faces
and
their
temperaments
ladies
of
lax
fibre
with
shining
lips
and
hazy
eyes
ladies
of
slender
build
with
small
and
fragile
foreheads
they
hang
for
ever
facing
their
uniformly
and
serious
lords
looking
at
those
faces
you
can
not
wonder
that
those
old
scholars
had
but
a
poor
opinion
of
woman
the
irrational
and
mutable
element
in
things
or
that
the
library
had
been
handed
down
from
father
to
son
from
uncle
to
nephew
evading
the
cosmic
vanity
by
devious
lines
of
descent
it
was
a
tradition
in
the
family
that
its
men
should
be
scholars
and
its
women
beauties
occasionally
frail
and
scholarship
in
obedience
to
the
family
tradition
ran
superbly
in
the
male
line
for
ten
generations
when
it
encountered
an
insuperable
obstacle
in
the
temperament
of
sir
frederick
then
came
sir
frederick
daughter
and
between
them
they
made
short
work
of
the
family
tradition
sir
frederick
had
appropriated
the
features
of
one
of
his
great
grandmothers
her
auburn
hair
her
eyes
her
tilted
lip
her
perfect
ease
of
manners
and
of
morals
by
a
still
more
perverse
hereditary
freak
the
harden
intellect
which
had
lapsed
in
sir
frederick
appeared
again
in
his
daughter
not
in
its
austere
and
colourless
form
but
with
a
certain
brilliance
and
passion
a
touch
of
purely
feminine
uncertainty
and
charm
the
harden
intellect
had
changed
its
sex
it
was
horace
jewdwine
who
had
found
that
out
counting
it
as
the
first
of
his
many
remarkable
discoveries
being
in
spite
of
his
conviction
to
the
contrary
a
jewdwine
rather
than
a
harden
he
had
felt
a
certain
malignant
but
voluptuous
satisfaction
in
drawing
the
attention
of
the
master
of
lazarus
to
this
curious
lapse
in
the
family
tradition
now
in
the
opinion
of
the
master
of
lazarus
the
feminine
intellect
was
simply
a
contradiction
in
terms
having
engaged
the
best
masters
in
the
county
whose
fees
together
with
their
fares
second
class
from
exeter
to
harmouth
he
had
himself
punctually
paid
he
had
declined
to
take
any
further
interest
in
his
he
had
no
objection
to
her
taking
up
music
a
study
which
being
no
musician
he
was
unable
to
regard
as
in
any
sense
intellectual
he
supported
his
view
by
frequent
allusions
to
the
brainlessness
of
in
fact
he
had
been
always
a
little
bitter
on
the
subject
having
before
his
eyes
the
flagrant
instance
of
his
son
frederick
frederick
was
no
scholar
he
despised
his
forefathers
as
a
race
of
pedants
and
boasted
that
he
never
opened
a
book
barring
the
book
of
life
in
which
he
flattered
himself
he
could
have
stood
a
very
stiff
examination
he
used
a
certain
unbowdlerized
edition
which
he
was
careful
to
conceal
from
the
ladies
of
his
family
before
he
was
forty
frederick
had
fiddled
away
the
family
tradition
and
not
only
the
family
tradition
but
the
family
splendour
and
the
family
credit
when
lucia
at
seventeen
was
studying
the
classics
under
horace
jewdwine
frederick
debts
came
rolling
in
at
about
the
same
period
old
sir
joseph
health
showed
signs
of
failing
and
frederick
took
to
raising
money
on
his
expectations
he
had
just
five
years
to
do
it
in
it
was
then
that
lucia
first
began
to
notice
a
change
in
her
grandfather
manner
towards
her
sometimes
she
would
catch
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
with
a
curious
scrutinizing
gaze
and
once
or
twice
she
thought
she
detected
in
them
a
profound
sadness
whenever
at
these
moments
they
happened
to
meet
her
eyes
they
were
immediately
averted
sir
joseph
had
not
been
given
to
betraying
emotion
save
only
on
points
of
scholarship
and
it
was
evident
that
he
had
something
on
his
mind
what
he
had
on
his
mind
was
the
thought
that
at
the
rate
frederick
was
living
he
might
at
any
moment
cease
to
live
and
then
what
would
become
of
lucia
and
what
would
become
of
the
harden
library
what
of
the
family
tradition
by
much
pondering
on
the
consequences
of
frederick
decease
sir
joseph
had
considerably
hastened
his
own
lucia
knew
nothing
of
all
this
she
was
only
aware
that
her
grandfather
had
sent
for
horace
jewdwine
on
his
what
had
passed
between
them
remained
known
only
to
horace
but
part
of
a
sum
of
money
left
by
sir
joseph
will
towards
the
founding
of
a
harden
scholarship
was
transferred
by
a
codicil
to
lucia
for
her
education
the
task
begun
by
horace
jewdwine
was
continued
by
a
learned
lady
miss
sophia
roots
and
miss
roots
did
her
work
so
well
that
when
sir
frederick
assumed
his
rightful
guardianship
of
his
daughter
he
pronounced
her
the
worst
educated
young
woman
in
europe
of
all
that
miss
roots
had
so
laboriously
imparted
to
her
she
retained
not
a
smattering
but
a
masterly
selection
and
now
at
four
and
twenty
she
had
what
is
called
a
beautiful
view
of
life
with
that
exciting
book
which
her
father
kept
so
sedulously
out
of
her
reach
she
was
acquainted
as
it
were
through
anthologies
and
translations
for
anything
lucia
knew
to
the
contrary
life
might
be
all
bursts
of
lyric
rapture
and
noble
sequences
of
selected
prose
she
was
even
in
danger
of
trusting
too
much
to
her
own
inspired
version
of
certain
passages
but
anthologies
are
not
always
representative
and
nobody
knew
better
than
lucia
that
the
best
translations
sometimes
fail
to
give
the
spirit
of
the
original
something
of
this
spirit
she
caught
from
her
father
brilliant
and
disturbing
presence
lucia
adored
her
father
he
brought
into
her
life
an
element
of
uncertainty
and
freedom
that
saved
it
from
the
tyranny
of
books
it
was
a
perpetual
coming
and
going
a
dozen
times
in
a
year
sir
frederick
hurled
himself
from
harmouth
to
london
from
london
to
the
continent
and
from
the
continent
back
again
to
harmouth
to
recruit
the
very
transience
of
his
appearances
and
lucia
ignorance
of
all
that
lay
behind
them
preserved
her
in
her
attitude
of
adoration
sir
frederick
took
precious
good
care
that
it
should
not
be
disturbed
by
the
familiarity
born
of
frequent
intercourse
that
she
should
see
him
only
in
his
moods
of
unnatural
sobriety
and
as
he
left
lucia
to
the
library
so
much
it
was
to
be
supposed
that
in
defiance
of
the
family
tradition
he
would
leave
the
library
to
lucia
but
after
all
sir
frederick
had
some
respect
for
the
family
tradition
when
it
seemed
only
too
likely
that
a
woman
would
inherit
the
harden
library
he
stepped
in
and
saved
it
from
that
supreme
disgrace
by
the
happy
expedient
of
a
bill
of
sale
otherwise
his
natural
inclination
would
have
been
to
leave
it
to
his
daughter
for
whom
he
had
more
or
less
affection
rather
than
to
his
nephew
for
whom
he
had
none
as
it
happened
it
was
horace
jewdwine
who
was
responsible
for
the
labour
which
lucia
had
so
impetuously
undertaken
lucia
was
aware
that
her
grandfather
desire
had
been
to
rearrange
and
catalogue
the
library
when
she
came
of
age
and
found
herself
mistress
of
a
tiny
income
derived
from
capital
left
by
her
mother
carefully
tied
up
to
keep
it
from
sir
frederick
and
enlarged
by
regular
accumulations
at
compound
interest
her
first
idea
was
to
carry
out
her
wishes
but
it
was
not
until
horace
jewdwine
last
visit
that
her
idea
became
a
determination
horace
had
been
strolling
round
the
library
turning
over
the
books
not
exactly
with
the
covetous
eye
of
the
heir
apparent
but
with
that
peculiar
air
of
appropriation
which
he
affected
in
all
matters
of
the
intellect
in
that
mood
lucia
had
found
him
irritating
and
it
had
appeared
that
horace
had
been
irritated
too
he
had
always
felt
a
little
sore
about
the
library
not
that
he
really
wanted
it
himself
but
that
he
hated
to
see
it
in
the
possession
of
such
a
rank
barbarian
as
his
uncle
frederick
a
person
who
if
his
life
depended
on
it
could
not
have
told
an
aldine
from
an
elzevir
a
person
incapable
not
only
of
appreciating
valuable
books
but
of
taking
ordinary
decent
care
of
them
there
were
gaps
on
the
shelves
a
thing
that
he
hated
to
see
lucia
too
lucia
would
take
books
out
by
tens
and
twenties
at
a
time
and
leave
them
lying
all
over
the
house
and
they
would
be
stuck
in
again
anywhere
and
anyhow
no
sort
of
method
in
their
arrangement
no
blinds
no
glass
doors
to
protect
them
he
had
pointed
this
out
to
lucia
suggesting
that
it
was
not
a
good
thing
to
let
too
much
dust
accumulate
on
the
tops
of
books
neither
was
it
altogether
desirable
that
a
strong
light
should
play
upon
them
all
day
long
had
she
ever
noticed
how
the
bindings
were
cracking
and
fading
for
all
this
he
seemed
to
be
blaming
lucia
and
this
lucia
tried
to
persuade
herself
was
no
great
matter
but
when
he
asked
for
a
catalogue
and
she
calmly
told
him
that
there
was
none
he
became
involved
in
a
sentence
about
a
scandal
and
a
vandal
in
which
his
opinion
of
his
uncle
frederick
unmistakably
appeared
he
even
forgot
himself
so
far
as
to
reflect
on
the
sanity
of
the
late
master
of
lazarus
at
which
point
lucia
had
left
him
to
his
reflections
she
had
not
yet
forgiven
horace
for
his
interference
that
day
nor
for
his
remark
about
the
scandal
and
the
vandal
as
for
his
other
observations
they
were
insufferably
rue
hence
her
desperate
efforts
to
set
the
library
in
order
before
she
went
abroad
hence
the
secrecy
and
haste
with
which
she
had
applied
to
rickman
without
asking
horace
advice
as
she
naturally
would
have
done
hence
too
her
vast
delight
at
the
success
of
her
unassisted
scheme
rickman
was
turning
out
splendidly
if
she
had
looked
all
through
london
she
could
not
have
found
a
better
man
chapter
xx
it
was
easter
sunday
and
lucia
heart
was
glad
for
she
had
had
a
letter
from
her
father
there
never
was
such
a
father
and
there
never
were
such
letters
as
once
in
a
blue
moon
and
when
the
fancy
seized
him
he
wrote
to
his
adorable
lucy
generally
speaking
they
were
all
about
himself
and
his
fiddle
the
fiddle
that
when
he
was
at
home
he
played
from
morning
to
night
but
this
letter
was
more
exciting
it
was
full
of
all
the
foolish
and
delightful
things
they
were
to
do
together
in
cannes
in
venice
and
in
florence
and
in
rome
he
was
always
in
one
or
other
of
these
places
but
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
proposed
that
his
adorable
lucy
should
join
him
you
too
young
to
see
the
world
he
used
to
say
you
would
enjoy
it
lucy
you
really
would
the
world
is
simply
wasted
on
any
woman
under
five
and
thirty
lucia
was
not
quite
five
and
twenty
she
was
not
very
strong
and
she
felt
that
if
she
did
see
the
world
soon
she
might
not
enjoy
it
very
much
when
she
did
see
it
and
it
was
barely
a
month
now
till
the
lucia
went
singing
downstairs
and
into
the
library
to
throw
all
its
four
windows
open
to
the
delicious
spring
and
there
to
her
amazement
for
it
was
sunday
she
came
upon
rickman
cataloguing
hard
she
felt
a
little
pang
of
at
the
sight
of
him
there
was
something
pathetic
in
his
attitude
in
his
bowed
head
and
spread
elbows
the
whole
assiduous
and
devoted
figure
how
hard
he
was
working
with
what
a
surprising
speed
in
his
slender
nervous
hands
she
had
not
meant
him
to
give
up
the
whole
of
his
three
days
holiday
to
her
and
she
really
could
not
take
his
easter
sunday
poor
little
man
so
with
that
courtesy
which
was
rickman
admiration
and
despair
she
insisted
on
restoring
it
to
him
and
earnestly
advised
his
spending
it
in
the
open
air
in
the
evening
he
could
have
the
library
to
himself
to
read
or
write
or
rest
in
he
would
she
thought
be
more
comfortable
there
than
in
the
inn
rickman
admitted
that
he
would
like
to
have
a
walk
to
stretch
his
legs
a
bit
and
as
she
opened
the
south
window
she
had
a
back
view
of
him
stretching
them
across
the
lawn
he
walked
as
rapidly
as
he
wrote
holding
his
head
very
high
in
the
air
he
wore
a
light
grey
suit
and
a
new
straw
hat
with
a
dull
olive
green
ribbon
on
it
poor
dear
she
was
glad
that
it
was
a
fine
day
for
the
hat
she
watched
him
till
the
hid
him
from
her
sight
then
she
opened
the
west
windows
and
the
south
wind
that
she
had
just
let
in
tried
to
rush
out
again
by
them
and
in
its
passage
it
lifted
up
the
leaves
of
rickman
catalogue
and
sent
them
flying
the
last
of
them
escaping
playfully
from
her
grasp
careered
across
the
room
and
hid
itself
under
a
window
curtain
stooping
to
recover
it
she
came
upon
a
long
slip
of
paper
printed
on
one
side
it
was
signed
and
savage
keith
rickman
was
the
name
she
had
seen
on
card
the
headline
in
drew
her
up
with
a
little
shock
of
recognition
the
title
was
familiar
so
was
the
motto
from
euripides
greek
su
dios
ephus
ô
helena
thugatêr
and
she
read
the
wonder
and
the
curse
of
friend
and
foe
she
watched
the
ranks
of
battle
cloud
and
shine
and
heard
achilles
that
great
voice
of
thine
that
thundered
in
the
trenches
far
below
tears
upon
tears
woe
upon
mortal
woe
follow
her
feet
and
funeral
fire
on
fire
while
she
that
phantom
of
the
heart
desire
flies
thither
where
all
dreams
and
phantoms
go
oh
strength
unconquerable
achilles
thee
she
follows
far
into
the
shadeless
land
of
leuce
girdled
by
the
gleaming
sand
amidst
the
calm
of
an
enchanted
sea
where
children
of
the
immortals
hand
in
hand
ye
share
one
golden
immortality
it
was
a
voice
from
the
sad
modern
world
she
knew
so
well
and
in
spite
of
its
form
which
was
a
little
too
and
conventional
to
please
her
she
felt
it
to
be
a
cry
from
the
heart
of
a
living
man
that
man
she
had
identified
with
the
boy
her
grandfather
had
found
years
ago
in
a
city
bookshop
there
had
been
no
room
for
doubt
on
that
point
when
she
saw
him
in
the
flush
of
his
intellectual
passion
bursting
so
joyously
so
preposterously
into
greek
he
had
therefore
already
a
certain
claim
on
her
attention
besides
he
seemed
to
be
undergoing
some
incomprehensible
struggle
which
she
conceived
to
be
of
a
moral
nature
and
she
had
been
sorry
for
him
on
that
account
but
if
he
were
also
was
it
possible
that
her
marvellous
boy
had
grown
into
her
cousin
still
more
marvellous
man
horace
too
had
made
his
great
discovery
in
a
city
shop
in
and
a
city
shop
it
hardly
amounted
to
proof
but
if
it
did
what
then
oh
then
she
was
still
more
profoundly
sorry
for
him
for
then
he
was
a
modern
poet
which
in
the
best
of
circumstances
is
to
be
marked
for
suffering
and
to
rickman
circumstances
had
not
been
exactly
kind
a
modern
poet
was
he
one
whom
the
gods
torment
with
inspired
and
hopeless
passion
a
lover
of
his
own
fugitive
and
yet
eternal
bride
the
helen
of
homer
of
æschylus
and
euripides
the
helen
of
marlowe
and
goethe
the
helen
of
them
all
and
for
rickman
unhappy
rickman
perdition
lurked
darkly
in
her
very
name
what
oh
what
must
it
feel
like
to
be
capable
of
eliding
the
aitch
in
helen
and
yet
divinely
and
deliriously
in
love
with
her
here
lucia
was
wrong
for
rickman
was
entirely
happy
with
the
aitch
in
helen
she
was
so
sorry
for
him
but
she
did
not
see
at
the
moment
what
she
could
do
for
him
besides
being
sorry
and
yet
if
he
were
friend
she
must
do
more
she
was
aware
that
she
had
been
sorry
for
him
chiefly
because
he
was
not
a
gentleman
well
she
had
seen
men
before
who
were
not
gentlemen
and
she
had
been
very
far
from
feeling
any
sort
of
sorrow
for
them
but
she
had
never
in
all
her
life
seen
anything
like
this
inspired
young
cockney
with
his
musical
voice
and
afflicting
accent
a
person
whose
emotions
declared
themselves
publicly
and
painfully
whose
thoughts
came
and
went
as
transparently
as
the
blood
in
his
cheeks
who
yet
contrived
somehow
to
remain
in
the
last
resort
impenetrable
she
could
not
ignore
him
apart
from
horace
he
had
established
his
claim
and
if
he
horace
friend
he
had
another
and
a
stronger
title
to
consideration
but
was
he
she
had
really
no
proof
she
wondered
whether
rickman
had
missed
his
sonnet
she
laid
it
almost
tenderly
in
a
conspicuous
place
on
his
table
and
put
a
bronze
head
of
pallas
athene
on
it
to
keep
it
down
then
she
wondered
again
whether
he
enjoyed
the
bookshop
whether
he
enjoyed
making
catalogues
whether
he
enjoyed
himself
generally
and
she
hoped
that
at
any
rate
he
would
enjoy
his
easter
sunday
poor
little
man
lucia
was
so
happy
herself
that
she
wanted
rickman
to
be
happy
too
chapter
xxi
rickman
was
anything
but
happy
as
he
set
out
for
his
walk
that
glorious
april
morning
outside
the
gate
of
court
house
he
stood
and
looked
about
him
uncertain
of
the
way
he
would
go
all
ways
were
open
to
him
and
finally
avoiding
the
high
road
he
climbed
up
a
steep
and
stony
lane
to
the
great
eastern
rampart
which
is
harcombe
hill
beneath
him
lay
harmouth
at
the
red
mouth
of
the
valley
where
the
river
hare
trickles
into
the
sea
through
a
barrier
of
shingle
two
gigantic
and
flaming
cliffs
dwarf
the
little
town
to
the
proportions
of
a
hamlet
in
any
other
situation
harmouth
might
have
preserved
its
elegant
regency
air
but
sprawling
on
the
beach
and
scattered
on
the
hillsides
it
has
a
haphazard
appearance
as
if
it
had
been
dropped
there
when
those
two
huge
arms
of
the
upland
stretched
out
and
opened
to
the
sea
but
nature
on
the
whole
has
been
kind
to
harmouth
though
the
first
thing
that
strikes
the
stranger
in
that
place
is
her
amazing
and
apparently
capricious
versatility
nature
round
about
harmouth
is
never
in
the
same
mood
for
a
mile
together
the
cliffs
change
their
form
and
colour
with
every
dip
in
the
way
now
they
are
red
like
blood
and
now
a
soft
and
powdery
pink
with
violet
shadows
in
their
seams
inland
it
is
a
medley
of
fields
and
orchards
dark
moorland
and
sallow
down
cut
by
the
deep
warm
lanes
where
hardly
a
leaf
stirs
on
a
windy
day
it
is
not
so
much
a
landscape
as
the
fragments
of
many
landscapes
samples
in
little
of
the
things
that
nature
does
elsewhere
on
a
grand
scale
the
effect
on
a
stranger
is
at
first
alluring
captivating
like
the
caprices
of
a
beautiful
woman
then
it
becomes
disconcerting
maddening
fatiguing
and
a
great
longing
seizes
him
for
vast
level
spaces
for
sameness
for
the
infinity
where
he
may
lose
himself
and
rest
then
one
day
he
climbs
to
the
top
of
harcombe
or
muttersmoor
and
finds
the
immensity
he
longed
for
as
far
as
his
sight
can
reach
the
shoulders
of
the
hills
and
the
prone
backs
of
the
long
ridges
are
all
of
one
height
the
combes
and
valleys
are
mere
rifts
and
dents
in
a
great
moor
that
has
no
boundary
but
the
sky
the
country
has
revealed
its
august
eternal
soul
he
is
no
longer
distracted
by
its
many
moods
he
loves
it
the
more
for
them
as
a
man
loves
the
mutable
ways
of
the
woman
whose
soul
he
knows
rickman
stood
upon
a
vantage
ground
looking
over
the
valley
and
the
bay
to
him
it
was
as
if
the
soul
of
this
land
like
the
soul
of
lucia
harden
had
put
on
a
veil
the
hillside
beneath
him
dropped
steeply
to
the
valley
and
the
town
down
there
alone
and
apart
from
harmouth
divided
from
the
last
white
regency
villa
by
half
a
mile
of
stood
court
house
and
as
he
looked
at
it
he
became
more
acutely
conscious
of
his
misery
he
sat
down
among
the
furze
and
heather
and
bracken
he
could
think
of
nothing
better
than
to
sit
there
and
stare
into
the
face
of
nature
not
like
a
poet
whom
love
makes
lyrical
but
like
a
quite
ordinary
person
whom
it
makes
dumb
and
nature
never
turned
to
a
poet
a
lovelier
and
more
appealing
face
it
had
rained
in
the
night
from
the
enfolding
blue
sky
blue
and
sea
blue
blue
of
the
aerial
hills
the
earth
flung
out
her
colours
new
washed
radiantly
immaculately
pure
bared
to
the
sea
she
flamed
from
rose
pink
to
rose
red
only
the
greater
hills
and
the
dark
flank
of
muttersmoor
waited
for
their
hour
the
hour
of
the
ling
and
the
heather
the
valleys
and
the
lower
slopes
were
glad
with
green
there
was
an
art
in
nature
way
for
lest
a
joyousness
so
brimming
and
so
tender
should
melt
and
overflow
into
mere
pathos
it
was
bounded
and
restrained
by
that
solemn
and
tragic
line
of
muttersmoor
drawn
straight
against
the
sky
it
was
the
same
scene
that
had
troubled
him
when
he
first
looked
at
it
and
it
troubled
him
still
not
with
that
thrill
of
prescient
delight
and
terror
but
with
a
feeling
more
mysterious
and
baffling
an
exquisite
and
indefinable
reproach
he
stared
as
if
he
could
hope
by
staring
to
capture
the
meaning
of
the
beautiful
tender
face
but
beyond
that
inscrutable
reproach
it
had
no
meaning
for
him
and
no
expression
he
had
come
to
a
land
prophetic
of
inspiration
where
if
anywhere
he
might
have
hoped
to
hear
the
lyric
soul
of
things
and
the
lyric
soul
of
things
absolutely
refused
to
sing
to
him
it
had
sung
loud
enough
in
the
streets
last
wednesday
it
had
hymned
the
procession
of
his
dreams
and
the
loud
tumultuous
orgy
of
his
passions
and
why
could
he
not
hear
it
now
for
here
his
senses
were
satisfied
to
the
full
never
had
nature
material
loveliness
been
more
vividly
piercingly
present
to
him
the
warm
air
was
like
a
touch
palpable
yet
divine
he
lay
face
downwards
on
the
earth
and
pressed
it
with
his
hands
he
smelt
the
good
smell
of
the
grass
and
young
bracken
and
the
sweet
blossom
of
the
furze
and
he
suffered
all
the
torment
of
the
lover
who
possesses
the
lips
and
body
of
his
mistress
and
knows
that
her
heart
is
far
from
him
and
that
her
soul
is
not
for
him
he
felt
himself
to
be
severed
from
the
sources
of
his
inspiration
estranged
profoundly
and
eternally
from
the
beauty
he
desired
and
that
conviction
melancholy
in
itself
was
followed
by
an
overpowering
sense
of
intellectual
dissolution
the
corruption
and
decay
of
the
poetic
faculty
in
him
he
was
aware
feverishly
aware
of
a
faint
flowing
measure
the
reverberation
of
dead
songs
of
ideas
a
miserable
attenuated
procession
trailing
feebly
in
the
dark
of
his
brain
which
when
he
tried
to
grasp
them
would
be
gone
they
were
only
the
ghosts
of
the
ideas
that
he
had
brought
with
him
from
london
that
had
died
on
the
journey
down
the
beauty
of
this
place
was
devilish
and
malign
he
looked
into
harmouth
valley
as
if
it
had
been
a
graveyard
they
were
all
buried
down
there
his
dead
dreams
and
his
dead
power
buried
without
hope
of
any
resurrection
rickman
genius
the
only
thing
he
genuinely
trusted
had
forsaken
him
it
may
be
that
every
poet
once
in
his
lifetime
has
to
come
to
this
calvary
to
hang
through
his
black
hour
on
the
cross
and
send
out
after
the
faithless
deity
his
lama
sabachthani
for
rickman
no
agony
could
compare
with
that
isolation
and
emptiness
of
soul
he
could
see
nothing
beyond
that
hour
for
he
had
never
felt
anything
like
it
before
not
even
on
waking
in
the
morning
after
getting
drunk
his
ideas
had
always
come
back
again
when
he
was
in
a
fit
state
to
receive
them
but
this
time
though
he
had
not
been
drinking
he
felt
that
they
had
gone
for
ever
and
that
all
his
songs
were
sung
and
over
his
head
high
up
in
the
sky
a
lark
a
little
fiend
of
a
lark
had
chosen
that
moment
for
bursting
into
music
with
diabolical
ease
and
maddening
ecstasy
he
flung
out
his
perfect
and
incommunicable
song
a
song
of
joy
and
mockery
and
triumph
he
did
not
know
how
old
that
skylark
was
but
here
was
he
savage
keith
rickman
played
out
at
three
and
twenty
was
it
he
wondered
the
result
not
of
ordinary
inebriety
but
of
the
finer
excesses
of
the
soul
was
he
a
precocious
genius
had
he
taken
to
the
immortal
drink
too
early
and
too
hard
or
was
it
as
jewdwine
had
suggested
that
there
were
too
many
rickmans
and
that
this
poor
seventh
part
of
him
had
been
crushed
by
the
competition
of
the
other
six
the
horrible
thing
was
that
they
would
live
on
for
years
eating
and
getting
drunk
and
falling
in
love
and
buying
suits
of
clothes
while
the
poet
in
him
was
dead
like
keats
at
three
and
twenty
then
suddenly
for
no
reason
whatever
a
vision
of
lucia
harden
rose
before
him
like
a
light
and
refused
to
leave
him
it
wrought
in
him
as
he
contemplated
it
a
gradual
burning
illumination
he
perceived
that
it
was
he
himself
who
was
responsible
for
all
this
he
perceived
the
real
nature
of
the
things
he
had
pursued
so
passionately
the
thing
he
called
pleasure
the
thing
he
called
love
and
the
thing
he
called
his
imagination
his
notion
of
pleasure
was
getting
drunk
and
making
love
to
miss
poppy
grace
the
love
he
made
was
better
described
by
a
stronger
and
coarser
monosyllable
and
he
had
used
his
imagination
to
glorify
it
oh
yes
because
he
had
imagination
because
he
was
a
poet
he
had
not
gone
down
into
the
and
wallowed
in
the
clay
neither
had
he
been
content
to
dabble
in
it
he
had
taken
it
up
in
his
hands
and
moulded
it
into
the
form
of
a
divinity
and
then
fallen
down
and
worshipped
it
fallen
down
and
worshipped
at
the
feet
the
gaily
twirling
feet
of
miss
poppy
grace
poor
poppy
if
he
could
have
thought
of
her
at
all
he
might
have
felt
a
sort
of
pity
for
her
transience
the
transience
of
the
feeling
she
inspired
but
he
did
not
think
of
her
he
did
not
even
try
to
think
of
her
her
image
once
so
persistent
had
dropped
clean
out
of
his
mind
which
was
one
reason
why
it
was
so
empty
it
had
not
been
much
to
boast
of
that
infatuation
for
poppy
and
yet
somehow
after
living
so
intimately
with
it
he
felt
quite
lost
without
it
it
was
a
little
odd
if
you
came
to
think
of
it
that
the
thing
he
called
his
genius
and
the
thing
he
called
his
love
should
have
chosen
the
same
moment
to
abandon
him
was
it
was
it
possible
that
there
was
some
vital
connection
between
them
as
the
singing
of
birds
in
the
pairing
season
was
his
genius
merely
a
rather
peculiar
symptom
of
the
very
ordinary
condition
known
as
falling
in
love
so
that
failing
that
source
of
inspiration
that
no
doubt
what
was
the
matter
with
him
his
imagination
languished
because
his
passion
for
poppy
was
played
out
and
he
had
nothing
to
put
in
its
place
well
yes
there
was
something
something
that
was
not
an
instinct
or
a
passion
but
an
acquired
taste
to
be
sure
he
had
acquired
it
very
quickly
it
had
only
taken
him
three
days
in
those
three
days
he
had
developed
a
preference
for
the
society
of
ladies
the
women
of
his
own
class
were
not
ladies
but
young
ladies
a
distinction
he
now
appreciated
for
the
first
time
it
was
a
preference
that
as
things
stood
he
would
never
be
able
to
gratify
there
was
something
about
it
ruinous
and
unhappy
like
a
craze
for
first
editions
in
an
impecunious
scholar
for
ever
limited
to
the
twopenny
bundle
and
the
eighteenpenny
lot
he
could
not
hope
to
enjoy
miss
harden
society
for
more
than
three
weeks
at
the
outside
he
only
enjoyed
it
at
all
through
an
accident
too
extraordinary
too
fantastic
to
occur
again
between
him
and
her
there
stood
the
barrier
of
the
counter
the
barrier
itself
was
not
insuperable
he
might
get
over
the
counter
so
might
miss
harden
but
there
were
other
things
that
she
never
could
get
over
though
in
some
ways
he
was
all
right
in
others
again
he
was
not
he
could
see
very
well
that
he
was
not
what
miss
harden
would
call
a
gentleman
he
was
through
that
abominable
nervousness
of
his
an
impossible
person
hopelessly
irredeemably
involved
in
social
solecisms
or
if
not
impossible
he
was
at
any
rate
highly
improbable
perceiving
all
this
he
was
still
unable
to
perceive
the
meaning
of
his
insight
and
his
misery
he
did
not
know
and
there
was
nobody
to
tell
him
that
this
emptiness
of
his
was
the
emptiness
created
by
the
forerunners
and
servants
of
love
who
sweep
and
purify
the
where
a
soul
has
died
and
another
soul
is
waiting
to
be
born
for
in
the
house
of
love
there
is
only
one
chamber
for
birth
and
for
dying
and
into
that
clean
unfurnished
place
the
soul
enters
unattended
and
endures
its
agony
alone
there
is
no
to
bear
for
it
the
of
the
new
life
but
rickman
was
young
and
youth
healthy
instinct
urged
him
to
vigorous
exercise
as
the
best
means
of
shaking
off
his
misery
he
crossed
the
road
that
runs
along
the
top
of
harcombe
hill
and
made
for
the
cliffs
in
a
direction
across
the
fields
he
then
kept
along
the
dipping
into
harcombe
valley
climbing
again
to
easton
down
here
the
coast
was
upheaved
into
terraces
of
grey
limestone
topped
by
a
layer
of
sand
riddled
with
rabbit
holes
before
one
of
these
two
young
hawks
were
watching
perched
on
a
projecting
boulder
so
intent
was
their
gaze
and
they
so
motionless
that
the
air
seemed
to
stand
still
and
wait
for
the
sweep
of
their
wings
rickman
whom
youth
made
reckless
lay
flat
on
his
stomach
and
peered
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
he
was
fascinated
breathlessly
absorbed
he
pressed
the
turf
a
little
closer
in
his
eagerness
and
so
loosened
a
large
stone
that
rolled
down
starting
a
cataract
of
sand
and
rubble
he
had
just
time
to
throw
himself
back
sideways
as
the
hollow
fringe
of
turf
gave
way
and
plunged
down
the
so
far
from
taking
his
escape
with
becoming
seriousness
he
amused
himself
by
trying
to
feel
as
he
would
have
felt
if
he
had
actually
gone
over
the
cliff
he
found
that
his
keenest
emotion
was
a
thrill
of
horror
as
he
imagined
miss
harden
a
possible
spectator
of
the
ridiculous
evolutions
performed
by
his
person
in
its
passage
through
the
air
after
an
hour
of
dipping
and
climbing
he
reached
a
small
fishing
village
here
he
dined
and
rested
and
it
was
before
he
turned
again
towards
harmouth
there
was
no
chance
of
missing
his
way
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
follow
the
as
he
had
done
before
there
were
signs
in
the
valley
of
the
white
fog
that
sometimes
even
in
april
comes
in
before
sunset
already
a
veil
of
liquid
air
was
drawn
across
the
hills
and
when
he
crossed
easton
down
if
it
was
easton
down
again
the
sea
face
was
blurred
with
mist
as
he
went
on
westwards
the
mist
kept
pace
with
him
gradually
diminishing
the
view
he
had
hoped
to
see
and
as
it
shifted
and
closed
round
him
his
movements
became
labyrinthine
then
circular
and
now
his
view
was
all
foreground
he
was
simply
walking
through
circles
of
moor
enclosed
by
walls
of
fine
grey
fog
he
passed
through
these
walls
like
a
spirit
into
smaller
and
smaller
circles
then
hopelessly
bewildered
he
stopped
turned
and
walked
in
what
he
took
to
be
a
contrary
direction
feeling
that
the
chance
of
going
over
the
lent
an
agreeable
excitement
to
a
pastime
that
threatened
to
become
monotonous
this
was
assuming
the
to
be
somewhere
near
and
he
was
beginning
to
feel
that
it
might
be
anywhere
under
his
feet
for
all
he
knew
when
the
fog
lifted
a
little
from
the
high
ground
and
he
saw
that
he
had
lost
his
bearings
altogether
he
had
been
going
round
and
round
through
these
circles
without
returning
to
the
point
he
started
from
he
went
forward
less
cautiously
in
a
larger
round
and
then
he
suddenly
stood
still
he
was
not
alone
his
foreground
had
widened
slightly
and
a
figure
stood
in
the
middle
of
it
there
was
something
familiar
in
the
blurred
outlines
traced
as
if
by
a
watery
finger
on
the
wall
of
mist
an
idea
had
taken
shape
stealthily
behind
him
and
flung
its
shadow
there
the
idea
was
lucia
harden
the
fog
hung
in
her
hair
in
drops
like
rain
it
made
her
grey
dress
cling
close
about
her
straight
fine
limbs
it
gave
its
own
grandeur
and
indistinctness
to
her
solitary
figure
she
turned
unstartled
but
with
an
air
of
imperfect
recognition
he
raised
his
hat
the
hat
with
the
green
ribbon
on
it
i
beg
your
pardon
but
can
you
tell
me
the
shortest
cut
to
harmouth
i
think
i
lost
my
way
she
answered
absently
you
are
all
right
turn
to
the
left
and
you
find
the
path
along
the
cliff
it
will
bring
you
out
on
to
harmouth
beach
he
followed
the
path
she
had
pointed
out
still
absently
she
looked
after
him
a
dim
figure
going
down
into
the
fog
and
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
had
sent
him
on
a
dangerous
way
there
were
rabbit
wires
and
pitfalls
on
that
path
places
where
the
cliff
was
eaten
away
under
its
curling
edge
of
turf
and
for
rickman
who
did
know
his
ground
a
single
step
might
mean
death
she
could
not
see
him
now
she
called
to
him
mr
rickman
but
there
was
no
answer
only
the
sound
of
rickman
going
down
deeper
she
called
again
a
little
imperiously
and
yet
again
the
last
time
her
voice
carried
well
for
there
was
the
vibrating
note
of
terror
in
it
he
turned
and
saw
her
coming
down
the
path
towards
him
i
forgot
she
said
still
with
the
slight
tremor
of
fear
in
her
voice
it
seemed
to
draw
out
and
intensify
its
sweetness
that
path
is
safe
in
a
fog
like
this
you
had
better
go
round
by
the
road
oh
thanks
you
should
have
troubled
i
should
have
got
on
all
right
they
were
climbing
up
the
moor
together
i
afraid
you
would
i
was
thinking
or
i
would
never
have
sent
you
that
way
why
not
it
was
a
very
good
way
yes
but
you
were
going
down
into
the
thick
of
the
fog
you
might
easily
have
walked
over
the
cliff
and
broken
your
neck
he
laughed
as
if
that
was
the
most
delightfully
humorous
idea
i
do
know
said
he
that
it
would
have
mattered
very
much
if
i
had
she
said
nothing
she
never
did
when
he
made
these
excursions
into
the
personal
of
course
it
would
not
have
mattered
to
miss
harden
if
he
had
gone
over
the
cliff
he
had
been
guilty
not
only
of
an
unpardonable
social
solecism
but
of
a
still
more
unpardonable
platitude
they
had
reached
the
top
of
the
cliff
and
lucia
stood
still
is
there
another
short
cut
cut
across
the
valley
he
asked
there
is
but
i
do
advise
you
to
try
it
and
there
is
a
way
round
by
the
road
if
you
can
find
it
he
smiled
had
he
tried
to
approach
her
too
soon
and
was
she
reminding
him
that
short
cuts
are
dangerous
there
was
a
way
round
if
he
could
find
it
if
indeed
oh
i
shall
find
it
all
right
said
he
inspired
by
his
double
meaning
i
do
think
you
will
if
the
fog
lasts
i
am
going
that
way
and
i
had
better
show
you
show
him
was
it
possible
she
led
the
way
all
too
swiftly
yet
with
a
certain
leisure
in
her
haste
he
followed
with
a
shy
delight
he
was
familiar
enough
by
this
time
with
her
indoor
aspect
with
her
unique
and
perfect
manner
of
sitting
still
now
he
saw
that
her
beauty
was
of
that
rare
kind
that
is
most
beautiful
in
movement
he
would
have
liked
that
walk
to
last
for
ever
for
the
pure
pleasure
of
following
now
the
delicate
poise
of
her
head
now
the
faint
ripple
of
her
shoulders
under
her
thin
coat
now
the
lines
of
her
skirt
breaking
and
flowing
with
the
almost
imperceptible
swinging
of
her
hips
her
beauty
as
he
now
reflected
was
of
the
sort
that
dwells
less
in
the
parts
than
in
the
whole
it
was
subtle
pervading
and
profound
it
rejected
all
but
the
finer
elements
of
sex
in
those
light
vanishing
curves
her
womanhood
was
more
suggested
than
defined
it
dawned
on
him
in
tender
adumbration
rather
than
in
light
such
beauty
is
eloquent
and
prophetic
through
its
richness
of
association
its
kindred
with
all
forms
of
loveliness
as
lucia
moved
she
parted
with
some
of
that
remoter
quality
that
had
first
fascinated
then
estranged
him
she
took
on
the
grace
of
the
creatures
that
live
free
in
the
sunlight
and
in
the
open
air
the
mist
shut
them
in
with
its
grey
walls
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
patch
of
grass
trodden
by
her
feet
and
her
moving
figure
grey
on
grey
the
walk
was
somewhat
lacking
in
incident
and
conversational
openings
such
as
occurred
seemed
like
kitty
palliser
hat
to
be
packed
with
meaning
there
was
the
moment
the
dreadful
moment
when
he
lagged
behind
and
lost
sight
of
her
the
moment
his
opportunity
when
an
enormous
bramble
caught
and
pinned
her
by
the
feet
and
skirt
she
tried
to
tread
on
it
with
one
foot
and
walk
away
from
it
with
the
other
a
thing
manifestly
impossible
and
absurd
besides
it
hurt
horribly
he
knelt
before
her
on
the
wet
moor
unconscious
of
his
trousers
conscious
of
nothing
but
the
exquisite
moment
and
with
hands
that
trembled
violently
freed
first
her
delicate
feet
and
then
her
skirt
he
breathed
hard
for
the
operation
was
intricate
and
took
time
that
bramble
seemed
to
have
neither
beginning
nor
end
it
branched
out
in
all
directions
and
was
set
with
multitudinous
and
powerful
thorns
lucia
stood
still
being
indeed
unable
to
move
and
watched
his
long
slender
fingers
adroitly
disentangling
her
i
afraid
you
hurting
yourself
said
she
not
at
all
said
rickman
gallantly
though
the
thorns
tortured
his
hands
drawing
drops
of
blood
his
bliss
annihilated
pain
take
care
said
she
you
are
letting
yourself
get
terribly
torn
he
took
no
notice
but
breathed
harder
than
ever
there
i
got
it
all
off
now
i
think
thank
you
very
much
she
drew
her
skirt
gently
from
his
detaining
grasp
no
wait
please
there
a
great
hulking
brute
of
a
thorn
stuck
in
the
hem
she
waited
confound
my
clumsiness
i
done
it
now
done
what
she
looked
down
on
the
dainty
hem
there
appeared
three
distinct
crimson
stains
rickman
face
was
crimson
too
with
a
flush
of
agony
whatever
he
did
for
her
his
clumsiness
made
wrong
i
awfully
sorry
but
i
ruined
your
your
pretty
dress
miss
harden
for
it
was
a
pretty
a
very
pretty
a
charming
dress
and
he
was
making
matters
worse
by
rubbing
it
with
his
please
please
do
bother
said
she
it
does
matter
how
different
from
the
behaviour
of
miss
walker
when
spinks
spilt
the
melted
butter
on
her
shoulder
you
hurt
your
own
hands
more
than
my
dress
the
episode
seemed
significant
of
the
perils
that
awaited
him
in
his
intercourse
with
miss
harden
she
went
on
the
narrow
ended
in
the
broad
that
goes
straight
up
harcombe
not
harmouth
valley
he
wondered
with
quite
painful
perplexity
whether
he
ought
still
to
follow
at
a
discreet
distance
or
whether
he
might
now
walk
beside
her
she
settled
the
question
by
turning
round
and
waiting
for
him
to
come
up
with
her
so
they
went
up
the
valley
together
and
together
climbed
the
steep
road
that
leads
out
of
it
and
back
in
the
direction
they
had
just
left
the
mist
was
thinner
here
at
the
top
of
the
hill
and
rickman
recognized
the
road
he
had
crossed
when
he
had
turned
eastwards
that
morning
he
could
now
have
found
his
way
back
perfectly
well
but
he
did
not
say
so
a
few
minutes
walk
brought
them
to
the
place
where
he
had
sat
down
in
his
misery
and
looked
over
harmouth
valley
here
they
stopped
each
struck
by
the
strange
landscape
now
suddenly
revealed
to
them
they
stood
in
clear
air
above
the
fog
it
had
come
rolling
in
from
the
south
submerging
the
cliffs
and
the
town
and
the
valley
and
now
it
lay
smooth
and
cold
and
like
the
sea
under
a
winter
sky
they
might
have
been
looking
down
on
some
mysterious
world
made
before
man
no
land
was
to
be
seen
save
the
tops
of
the
hills
lashed
by
the
torn
edges
of
the
mist
westward
across
the
bay
the
peaks
of
the
cliffs
showed
like
a
low
flat
coast
a
dull
purplish
line
tormented
by
a
livid
surf
the
flooded
valley
had
become
an
arm
of
that
vague
sea
and
from
under
the
fog
immeasurably
far
below
there
came
the
muffled
sound
of
the
mother
sea
as
if
it
were
beating
on
the
invisible
floor
of
the
world
i
say
that
rather
uncanny
is
it
so
uncanny
did
it
seem
to
him
that
he
felt
that
it
called
for
remark
she
looked
at
him
with
that
faintly
interrogative
lifting
of
the
eyebrows
which
always
seemed
familiar
to
him
he
remembered
afterwards
that
horace
jewdwine
had
the
same
trick
but
in
her
accompanied
as
it
was
by
a
pretty
lifting
of
the
corners
of
her
mouth
it
expressed
friendly
interest
in
jewdwine
apathy
and
a
certain
insolence
and
yet
all
the
time
she
was
wondering
how
she
should
break
it
to
him
that
their
ways
must
now
diverge
there
a
horrible
unconsciousness
about
it
he
went
on
pursuing
as
usual
his
own
fancy
if
you
get
bare
nature
without
spirit
it
would
look
like
that
it
look
quite
real
she
admitted
after
that
there
must
be
no
more
concessions
they
must
separate
it
has
any
reality
but
what
we
give
it
has
it
a
statement
so
sweeping
challenged
contradiction
you
think
that
only
my
cockney
view
i
think
it
is
nature
it
your
own
idea
it
is
even
my
own
idea
i
bagged
it
from
coleridge
say
he
muddled
himself
with
opium
till
he
could
tell
which
was
nature
and
which
was
coleridge
but
there
was
old
wordsworth
as
sober
as
a
churchwarden
and
he
knew
what
you
call
my
cockney
view
is
the
view
of
the
modern
poets
they
do
they
ca
distinguish
between
nature
and
the
human
soul
talk
of
getting
near
to
nature
we
know
nature
if
we
saw
it
now
those
everlasting
poets
have
got
so
near
it
that
they
blocked
the
view
for
themselves
and
everybody
else
really
you
talk
as
if
they
were
a
set
of
trippers
so
they
are
wordsworth
was
nothing
but
a
tripper
a
glorified
tripper
nature
never
looked
the
same
since
he
ran
his
through
the
lake
country
special
service
to
tintern
and
yarrow
this
is
slightly
profane
no
it
only
means
that
if
you
want
nature
you
mus
go
to
the
poets
of
nature
they
humanized
it
i
would
mind
that
if
they
womanized
it
too
that
only
means
that
they
loved
it
she
said
softly
it
means
that
they
demoralized
it
and
that
now
it
demoralizes
us
nature
is
the
supreme
sentimentalist
it
all
their
fault
been
flinging
themselves
on
the
bosom
of
mother
earth
and
sitting
and
writing
stanzas
in
dejection
on
it
and
lying
down
like
a
tired
child
on
it
and
weeping
away
their
lives
of
care
that
they
have
borne
and
yet
must
bear
on
it
till
they
saturated
it
with
their
beastly
pathos
there
is
a
dry
comfortable
place
left
for
anybody
else
perhaps
that
just
the
way
nature
inspires
poets
by
giving
out
the
humanity
it
absorbs
perhaps
i
ca
say
it
inspires
me
are
you
a
poet
she
asked
she
was
beginning
to
think
it
must
be
a
case
of
mistaken
identity
for
this
was
not
what
she
had
expected
of
him
he
did
not
answer
at
first
neither
did
he
look
at
her
he
looked
at
the
beautiful
face
of
nature
the
sentimentalist
and
a
wave
of
hot
colour
rushed
again
over
his
own
i
do
know
whether
i
am
or
not
let
us
hope
not
since
you
want
to
make
a
clean
sweep
of
them
i
make
a
clean
sweep
of
myself
if
i
stood
in
my
own
light
anything
for
a
good
view
but
i
afraid
it
too
late
his
tone
dropped
from
the
extreme
of
levity
to
an
almost
tragic
earnest
we
done
our
work
and
it
ca
be
undone
we
given
nature
a
human
voice
and
now
we
shall
never
never
hear
anything
else
that
rather
dreadful
i
wish
you
had
oh
no
you
do
it
not
the
human
voice
you
draw
the
line
at
it
the
cockney
accent
lucia
smile
flickered
and
went
out
extinguished
by
the
waves
of
her
blush
she
was
not
prepared
to
have
her
thoughts
read
and
read
aloud
to
her
in
this
way
and
that
particular
thought
was
one
she
would
have
preferred
him
not
to
read
i
daresay
keats
had
a
cockney
accent
if
we
did
but
know
and
i
daresay
a
good
many
people
never
heard
anything
else
i
afraid
you
have
heard
it
yourself
miss
harden
if
you
met
him
possibly
it
is
what
i
should
have
remembered
him
by
though
that
reminds
me
i
came
upon
a
poem
a
sonnet
of
yours
if
it
was
yours
this
morning
it
was
lying
on
the
library
floor
you
will
find
it
under
the
bronze
pallas
on
the
table
rickman
stooped
picked
up
a
sod
and
examined
it
carefully
thank
you
very
much
it
mine
i
was
afraid
it
was
lost
it
would
have
been
a
great
pity
if
it
had
been
rickman
dropped
his
sod
she
answered
the
question
that
appeared
in
his
eyes
though
not
on
his
tongue
yes
i
read
it
it
was
printed
you
see
i
read
it
before
i
could
make
up
my
mind
whether
i
might
or
not
it
was
all
right
but
i
wish
you
had
to
look
at
rickman
you
would
have
said
that
all
his
mind
was
concentrated
on
the
heel
of
his
boot
as
it
slowly
but
savagely
ground
the
sod
to
dust
even
so
the
action
seemed
to
say
even
so
could
he
have
destroyed
that
sonnet
what
did
you
think
of
it
he
had
looked
up
when
she
least
expected
with
his
disarming
and
ingenuous
smile
lucia
felt
that
he
had
laid
an
ambush
for
her
by
his
abstraction
the
question
and
the
smile
shot
flashed
out
of
it
with
a
directness
that
made
subterfuge
impossible
the
seriousness
of
the
question
was
what
made
it
so
awkward
for
a
lady
with
the
instinct
if
rickman
had
merely
asked
her
if
she
liked
his
new
straw
hat
with
the
olive
green
ribbon
supposing
them
to
be
on
terms
that
made
such
a
question
possible
she
would
probably
have
said
yes
whether
she
liked
it
or
not
because
she
wanted
to
give
pleasure
because
she
did
care
a
straw
about
his
straw
hat
but
when
rickman
asked
her
how
she
liked
his
sonnet
he
was
talking
about
the
things
that
really
mattered
and
in
the
things
that
really
mattered
lucia
was
sincerity
itself
i
thought
said
she
i
thought
the
first
dozen
lines
extremely
beautiful
in
a
sonnet
line
should
be
beautiful
should
be
perfect
oh
if
you
aiming
at
perfection
why
what
else
in
heaven
name
should
i
aim
at
lucia
was
silent
and
he
mistook
her
silence
for
distrust
i
do
want
you
to
judge
me
by
that
sonnet
but
i
should
dream
of
judging
you
by
that
sonnet
any
more
than
i
should
judge
that
sonnet
by
its
last
two
lines
they
not
the
last
you
ever
write
they
the
last
you
will
ever
read
well
it
something
to
have
written
one
good
sonnet
one
swallow
does
make
a
spring
no
but
it
tells
us
spring
is
coming
and
the
other
swallows
there
wo
be
any
other
swallows
all
my
swallows
have
flown
oh
they
fly
back
again
you
see
if
you
wait
till
next
spring
you
were
serious
just
now
when
you
asked
me
if
i
was
a
poet
was
serious
enough
when
i
said
i
did
know
something
passed
over
lucia
face
a
ripple
of
shadow
and
flame
some
moving
of
the
under
currents
of
the
soul
that
told
him
that
he
was
understood
that
something
had
happened
there
something
that
for
the
moment
permitted
him
to
be
personal
what
made
you
say
so
i
ca
tell
you
not
natural
modesty
i
modest
about
some
things
but
not
about
that
yet
surely
you
must
know
i
did
yesterday
yesterday
yesterday
last
night
in
fact
up
to
eleven
this
morning
i
firmly
believed
that
i
had
genius
or
something
uncommonly
like
it
i
still
believe
that
i
it
he
seemed
to
himself
to
have
become
almost
grossly
personal
but
to
lucia
he
had
ceased
to
be
personal
at
all
he
had
passed
into
the
region
of
realities
and
in
so
passing
had
become
intensely
interesting
to
lucia
with
the
blood
of
ten
generations
of
scholars
in
her
veins
the
question
of
a
man
talent
was
supremely
important
the
man
himself
might
not
matter
but
his
talent
mattered
very
much
to
discuss
it
with
him
was
entirely
natural
and
proper
so
she
never
once
stopped
to
ask
herself
why
she
was
standing
on
harcombe
hill
holding
this
really
very
intimate
conversation
with
rickman
the
things
he
continued
the
things
i
written
prove
it
i
can
say
so
without
the
smallest
conceit
because
i
have
it
now
and
never
shall
have
it
again
i
feel
as
if
it
had
belonged
to
somebody
else
rickman
was
losing
all
likeness
to
his
former
self
he
spoke
no
longer
impulsively
but
in
the
steady
deliberate
tones
of
unalterable
conviction
and
lucia
no
longer
heard
the
cockney
accent
in
this
voice
that
came
to
her
out
of
a
suffering
so
lucid
and
so
profound
she
forgot
that
it
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
social
gulf
if
at
any
point
in
that
conversation
she
had
thought
of
dismissing
him
she
could
not
have
dismissed
him
now
there
was
very
little
use
in
having
saved
his
neck
if
she
abandoned
him
to
his
misery
instead
of
abandoning
him
she
sat
down
on
a
rough
seat
by
the
roadside
to
consider
rickman
case
in
all
its
bearings
in
doing
so
she
found
herself
for
the
first
time
contemplating
his
personal
appearance
as
such
and
that
not
altogether
with
disapproval
though
it
was
not
in
the
least
what
she
would
have
expected
he
showed
to
advantage
in
the
open
air
she
began
to
perceive
the
secret
of
his
extravagant
and
preposterous
charm
there
was
something
about
him
something
that
he
had
no
right
to
have
about
him
being
born
a
dweller
in
cities
which
none
the
less
he
undeniably
and
inevitably
had
something
that
made
him
one
with
this
moorland
setting
untamed
and
beautiful
and
shy
the
great
natural
features
of
the
landscape
did
him
no
wrong
for
he
was
natural
too
well
she
had
found
his
sonnet
for
him
but
could
she
help
him
to
recover
what
he
had
lost
now
i
hope
you
wo
mind
my
asking
but
do
you
know
any
one
who
can
help
you
not
any
one
who
can
help
me
out
of
this
i
believe
it
must
have
been
you
sir
joseph
harden
used
to
talk
about
i
think
he
saw
you
once
when
you
were
a
boy
i
know
if
he
were
alive
he
would
have
been
glad
to
help
you
he
did
help
me
i
owe
my
education
to
the
advice
he
gave
my
father
is
that
the
case
i
am
very
glad
she
paused
exultant
she
felt
that
she
was
now
upon
the
right
track
you
said
you
had
written
other
things
what
have
you
written
a
lyrical
drama
for
one
thing
that
sonnet
was
meant
for
a
sort
of
motto
to
it
a
lyrical
drama
she
was
right
then
he
was
horace
jewdwine
great
find
if
so
the
subject
was
fenced
around
with
difficulty
she
must
on
no
account
give
horace
away
rickman
had
seemed
annoyed
because
she
had
read
his
sonnet
which
was
printed
he
would
be
still
more
annoyed
if
he
knew
that
she
had
read
his
lyrical
drama
in
manuscript
he
was
inclined
to
be
reticent
about
his
writings
lucia
was
wrong
rickman
had
never
been
less
inclined
to
reticence
in
his
life
he
wished
she
had
read
his
drama
instead
of
his
sonnet
his
was
there
the
swift
unreturning
of
his
youth
if
she
had
read
his
drama
she
would
have
believed
in
his
pursuit
of
the
intangible
perfection
as
it
was
she
never
would
believe
i
wonder
she
said
feeling
her
ground
carefully
if
my
cousin
horace
jewdwine
would
be
any
good
to
you
mr
jewdwine
do
you
know
him
yes
slightly
that
is
he
knows
he
knows
what
i
can
do
i
mean
what
i
done
really
the
chain
of
evidence
was
now
complete
well
what
does
he
say
rickman
laughed
as
he
recalled
his
last
conversation
with
the
critic
he
says
i
part
a
poet
does
he
then
you
may
be
very
sure
you
are
a
great
deal
more
my
cousin
is
most
terribly
exacting
i
should
be
glad
if
i
succeeded
in
satisfying
him
but
i
do
think
i
should
be
seriously
unhappy
if
if
i
failed
did
he
say
anything
to
discourage
to
depress
you
not
he
i
do
think
i
should
have
minded
if
he
had
i
felt
strong
enough
for
anything
then
it
was
this
morning
i
was
sitting
out
here
looking
at
all
this
beautiful
inspiring
scenery
when
it
came
to
me
that
notion
that
i
should
never
do
anything
again
is
it
her
hesitations
were
delightful
to
him
is
it
the
want
of
recognition
that
disheartens
you
he
laughed
again
a
healthy
honest
laugh
oh
dear
me
no
i
worry
about
recognition
that
would
be
all
right
if
i
could
go
on
but
i
ca
go
on
have
you
ever
felt
like
this
before
n
no
no
never
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
think
why
i
should
now
and
yet
you
been
making
catalogues
for
years
have
you
lucia
had
said
to
herself
it
that
catalogue
i
know
do
you
like
making
catalogues
well
under
ordinary
circumstances
it
is
exactly
what
you
call
exciting
but
i
afraid
that
has
got
anything
to
do
with
it
this
time
it
may
have
everything
to
do
with
it
such
a
dreadful
kind
of
work
no
it
is
the
work
that
dreadful
then
perhaps
it
the
worry
and
i
afraid
i
responsible
for
that
he
started
shaken
out
of
his
admirable
by
that
glaring
personality
how
could
you
be
by
insisting
on
engaging
you
as
i
did
from
what
you
told
me
very
evident
that
you
had
something
on
your
mind
and
that
the
work
has
been
very
dreadful
very
difficult
i
something
on
my
mind
and
it
been
difficult
all
the
same
i
would
have
pressed
you
if
i
had
really
known
i
very
sorry
is
it
too
late
would
it
be
any
good
if
i
released
you
now
if
she
released
him
miss
harden
you
are
most
awfully
good
to
me
that
help
you
he
looked
at
her
over
her
face
there
ran
again
that
little
ripple
of
thought
and
sympathy
like
shadow
and
flame
one
fear
was
removed
from
him
whatever
happened
miss
harden
would
never
misunderstand
him
at
the
same
time
he
realized
that
any
prospect
however
calamitous
would
be
more
endurable
than
the
course
she
now
proposed
it
would
help
me
the
best
thing
i
can
do
is
to
stay
where
i
am
and
finish
is
that
the
truth
nothing
but
the
truth
but
not
the
whole
truth
thought
lucia
well
she
said
rising
whatever
you
do
do
lose
heart
he
smiled
drearily
it
was
all
very
well
to
say
that
when
his
heart
was
lost
already
wait
wait
till
next
spring
comes
he
could
put
what
meaning
he
liked
into
that
graceful
little
commonplace
but
it
dismissed
at
the
same
time
that
it
reassured
him
the
very
ease
and
delicacy
with
which
it
was
done
left
him
no
doubt
on
that
point
he
was
not
going
to
accept
his
dismissal
then
and
there
a
bold
thought
leapt
in
his
brain
could
he
might
he
she
had
read
his
sonnet
would
it
do
to
ask
her
to
read
his
drama
also
to
be
sure
the
sonnet
had
but
fourteen
lines
while
the
drama
had
twice
as
many
hundred
but
the
drama
the
drama
his
beautiful
in
was
his
ultimate
achievement
the
highest
completest
expression
of
his
soul
and
what
he
required
of
lucia
harden
was
not
her
praise
but
fuller
more
perfect
comprehension
he
stood
in
a
cruel
and
false
position
and
he
longed
for
her
to
know
the
finest
and
the
best
of
him
before
she
knew
as
she
must
know
the
worst
she
was
turning
away
but
there
was
a
closed
gate
between
her
and
the
that
led
down
into
the
valley
miss
harden
yes
she
turned
his
heart
beat
violently
he
was
afraid
to
look
up
lest
his
face
should
betray
his
emotion
it
must
seem
so
disproportioned
to
its
cause
and
yet
he
was
going
to
ask
her
for
leave
to
put
his
drama
the
fine
offspring
of
his
soul
into
her
hands
may
i
send
you
the
drama
i
spoke
of
i
would
like
you
to
see
it
nothing
would
give
me
greater
pleasure
he
tried
to
stammer
out
some
words
of
thanks
but
they
died
before
utterance
you
know
your
way
now
do
you
said
she
yes
thanks
her
hand
was
on
the
gate
he
opened
it
to
let
her
pass
he
also
made
a
movement
as
though
he
would
have
held
out
his
hand
but
thought
better
of
it
raising
his
hat
instead
he
stood
uncovered
until
she
had
passed
he
walked
up
and
down
the
road
giving
her
time
to
get
well
out
of
sight
then
he
returned
to
the
place
where
he
had
suffered
and
stood
a
long
while
looking
over
the
valley
he
knew
now
the
meaning
of
his
great
misery
and
it
was
misery
no
longer
the
veil
was
lifted
from
the
face
of
nature
and
it
was
a
face
that
he
had
never
yet
seen
it
had
lost
that
look
of
mysterious
indefinable
reproach
it
was
as
if
the
beauty
of
the
land
seeking
after
the
heart
that
should
love
it
was
appeased
and
reconciled
he
could
hear
the
lyric
soul
of
things
most
clearly
and
unmistakably
and
it
was
singing
a
new
song
a
strange
contradictory
song
there
was
sorrow
in
it
such
sorrow
as
her
children
drink
from
the
breast
of
the
tragic
earth
and
through
it
all
and
over
it
the
laughter
as
of
some
yet
virgin
and
imperishable
joy
for
nature
sings
to
every
poet
the
song
of
his
own
soul
he
spent
the
last
of
that
easter
sunday
in
his
shabby
little
bedroom
in
the
marine
hotel
where
with
windows
open
to
the
wind
and
sea
he
sat
writing
long
past
midnight
and
hope
rose
again
in
him
as
he
surveyed
the
first
rough
draft
that
wild
battlefield
and
of
lines
lines
shooting
and
flying
in
all
directions
lines
broken
and
scattered
and
routed
by
other
lines
and
trampled
down
by
word
upon
triumphing
word
above
the
hideous
confusion
at
least
two
verses
shone
luminous
and
clear
they
had
come
swinging
into
the
pure
ether
and
golden
from
their
birth
and
over
the
whole
he
wrote
in
legible
characters
harcombe
his
doubt
had
died
there
and
on
easter
monday
he
awoke
exulting
in
another
blessed
day
chapter
xxii
lucia
had
yielded
recklessly
to
her
instinct
and
was
only
half
contented
she
had
given
pleasure
to
her
father
by
writing
him
a
long
letter
she
was
in
a
fair
way
of
giving
pleasure
to
horace
jewdwine
by
undertaking
this
monstrous
labour
of
the
catalogue
and
she
had
given
pleasure
to
herself
in
giving
pleasure
to
them
but
there
was
one
person
to
whom
she
had
not
given
pleasure
and
that
person
was
horace
jewdwine
friend
on
the
contrary
she
had
robbed
the
poor
man
of
the
one
solitary
pleasure
he
had
anticipated
in
his
three
days
holiday
with
what
disastrous
results
she
had
just
witnessed
it
was
impossible
for
lucia
to
do
anybody
a
wrong
however
innocently
without
making
up
for
it
on
that
sunday
evening
she
conceived
a
great
idea
she
had
deprived
rickman
of
a
small
opportunity
she
would
give
him
a
large
one
restitution
was
to
be
on
a
noble
scale
lucia
had
a
small
sum
left
to
her
by
her
grandfather
and
even
when
rickman
was
paid
for
his
four
weeks
work
on
the
catalogue
that
sum
would
only
be
reduced
to
on
the
strength
of
it
she
now
proposed
to
offer
rickman
the
post
of
secretary
to
herself
for
one
year
at
a
salary
of
a
hundred
the
remainder
to
be
devoted
to
his
travelling
and
household
expenses
as
secretary
he
would
assist
her
in
editing
sir
joseph
unpublished
works
while
she
secured
him
abundant
leisure
for
his
own
for
one
year
he
would
be
free
from
all
sordid
demands
on
his
time
and
energy
he
would
be
free
for
one
year
from
the
shop
and
the
quarterly
catalogue
he
would
enrich
his
mind
and
improve
his
manners
with
travel
for
one
year
at
the
end
of
that
year
he
would
know
if
there
was
anything
in
him
in
other
words
she
would
give
the
little
man
his
chance
the
plan
had
the
further
advantage
that
it
would
have
given
her
grandfather
pleasure
if
he
could
have
known
it
it
was
also
to
be
presumed
that
it
would
give
pleasure
to
horace
jewdwine
since
it
was
the
very
thing
he
himself
had
said
he
wished
to
do
for
rickman
of
all
conceivable
ways
of
spending
sir
joseph
money
it
was
the
fittest
and
most
beautiful
in
its
lesser
way
it
was
in
line
with
the
best
traditions
of
the
family
for
the
hardens
had
been
known
for
generations
as
the
patrons
of
poor
scholars
and
struggling
men
of
letters
and
as
lucia
inherited
the
intellect
of
her
forefathers
in
a
more
graceful
capricious
and
spontaneous
form
so
what
in
them
had
been
heavy
patronage
appeared
in
her
as
the
instinct
if
she
had
inherited
a
large
fortune
along
with
it
she
would
have
been
a
lady
of
lavish
and
indiscreet
munificence
by
way
of
discretion
she
slept
on
her
programme
before
finally
committing
herself
to
it
in
the
morning
discretion
suggested
that
she
had
better
wait
a
week
she
decided
to
act
on
that
suggestion
at
the
same
time
she
stifled
the
inner
voice
which
kept
telling
her
that
the
thing
she
was
doing
to
please
horace
would
not
really
please
him
at
all
she
had
already
ignored
the
advice
he
had
given
her
on
one
point
for
horace
had
long
ago
told
her
plainly
that
there
was
no
use
in
editing
their
grandfather
posthumous
works
that
on
any
subject
other
than
textual
criticism
sir
joseph
was
absurd
meanwhile
by
sympathy
perhaps
rickman
also
had
become
discreet
he
entered
on
his
new
week
a
new
man
as
if
he
had
divined
that
he
was
on
his
trial
he
redoubled
his
prodigious
efforts
he
applied
himself
to
his
hideous
task
with
silent
and
concentrated
frenzy
he
seemed
to
live
and
move
and
have
his
being
in
the
catalogue
whenever
lucia
had
occasion
to
look
up
at
him
he
was
assiduous
rapid
absorbed
he
never
stopped
to
talk
about
æschylus
and
euripides
now
and
then
they
exchanged
a
necessary
word
but
not
more
than
once
or
twice
in
the
morning
if
lucia
by
any
chance
gave
him
an
opening
he
ignored
it
he
maintained
a
silence
that
was
almost
stern
rickman
was
undergoing
a
process
of
regeneration
he
would
not
have
called
it
by
so
fine
a
name
in
fact
in
its
earlier
stages
he
seemed
to
himself
to
be
merely
pushing
to
the
point
of
mania
a
strong
predilection
for
personal
cleanliness
he
was
first
of
all
possessed
recklessly
ruinously
by
a
passion
for
immaculate
shirts
he
had
telegraphed
to
spinks
to
send
down
all
of
his
linen
that
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
meanwhile
he
had
supplied
deficiencies
at
the
local
haberdashers
at
downey
there
was
a
low
standard
for
the
more
slender
particulars
of
the
toilette
and
rickman
had
compared
favourably
with
his
now
he
looked
back
with
incredulity
and
horror
to
his
former
self
since
his
person
had
been
brought
into
daily
contact
with
miss
harden
he
had
begun
to
bestow
on
it
a
solemn
almost
religious
care
in
the
matter
of
the
pocket
handkerchief
he
practised
an
extreme
ritual
permitting
himself
none
but
the
finest
lawn
which
he
changed
after
the
first
trivial
crumpling
the
being
thus
glorified
and
exalted
in
the
hierarchy
of
dress
one
source
of
painful
misgiving
was
removed
for
the
first
few
days
he
had
been
merely
formal
in
this
cult
of
the
person
piety
was
appeased
with
external
rites
and
symbols
with
changes
of
vestment
excessive
lustrations
and
the
like
now
he
had
grown
earnest
uncompromising
in
his
religion
and
consistency
entailed
a
further
step
clearly
his
person
the
object
of
such
superstitious
veneration
must
be
guarded
from
all
unbecoming
and
ridiculous
accidents
such
an
accident
for
instance
as
getting
drunk
if
you
came
to
think
of
it
few
things
could
be
more
compromising
to
the
person
than
that
heavens
if
miss
harden
had
seen
it
last
wednesday
night
and
since
any
friendship
with
ladies
of
doubtful
character
might
be
considered
equally
derogatory
from
its
dignity
he
further
resolved
to
eliminate
absolutely
miss
poppy
grace
he
took
no
credit
for
these
acts
of
renunciation
they
seemed
to
him
no
more
morally
meritorious
than
the
removal
of
dust
from
his
coat
sleeves
or
of
from
his
hands
but
though
he
exterminated
the
devil
in
him
with
so
light
a
touch
it
was
gravely
tragically
almost
that
he
turned
to
the
expulsion
of
the
cockney
intoxication
was
an
unlucky
casualty
so
if
you
came
to
think
of
it
was
a
violent
infatuation
for
miss
poppy
grace
infinitely
more
disastrous
more
humiliating
were
the
fatal
habits
of
his
speech
take
the
occasional
but
terrific
destruction
of
the
aitch
it
was
worse
than
drink
it
wrecked
a
man
more
certainly
more
utterly
beyond
redemption
and
excuse
it
was
anxiety
on
this
point
that
partly
accounted
for
his
reserve
he
simply
dared
not
talk
about
æschylus
or
euripides
because
such
topics
were
exciting
and
excitement
was
apt
to
induce
this
lapse
but
most
of
all
he
dreaded
the
supreme
agitation
of
love
for
he
knew
now
perfectly
well
what
had
happened
to
him
though
he
had
never
known
it
happen
to
him
in
this
manner
before
it
was
love
as
his
heart
had
imagined
it
in
the
days
before
he
became
the
thrall
of
miss
poppy
grace
he
had
known
the
feeling
but
until
now
he
had
not
known
the
woman
who
could
inspire
it
it
was
as
if
his
heart
had
renewed
its
primal
virginity
in
preparation
for
some
divine
experience
the
night
of
sunday
beheld
the
withdrawal
of
rickman
into
the
immensity
of
his
preposterous
dream
from
this
blessed
state
he
emerged
on
monday
morning
enlightened
as
to
the
whole
comedy
and
tragedy
of
his
passion
to
approach
lucia
harden
required
nothing
less
than
a
change
of
spirit
and
rickman
doubted
whether
he
could
manage
that
he
could
only
change
his
shirts
and
at
this
point
there
arose
the
hideous
fear
lest
love
itself
might
work
to
hinder
and
betray
him
as
it
turned
out
love
proved
his
ally
not
his
enemy
so
far
from
exciting
him
it
produced
a
depression
that
rendered
him
disinclined
for
continuous
utterance
in
this
it
did
him
good
service
it
prevented
him
from
obtruding
his
presence
unduly
on
miss
harden
in
his
seat
at
the
opposite
table
he
had
achieved
something
of
her
profound
detachment
her
consummate
calm
and
lucia
said
to
herself
good
he
can
keep
quiet
for
a
whole
day
at
a
time
which
is
what
i
doubted
six
days
had
passed
in
this
manner
and
he
had
not
yet
attempted
to
penetrate
the
mystery
and
seclusion
of
the
aldine
plato
the
neapolitan
horace
and
the
of
wynkyn
de
worde
he
turned
away
his
eyes
from
that
corner
of
the
bookcase
where
he
had
good
reason
to
suppose
them
to
be
he
would
have
to
look
at
them
some
time
meanwhile
he
shrank
from
approaching
them
as
from
some
gross
impiety
his
father
had
written
to
him
several
times
making
special
inquiries
after
the
aldine
plato
the
neapolitan
horace
and
the
of
wynkyn
de
worde
he
replied
with
generalities
in
a
guarded
manner
he
was
kept
very
busy
and
was
as
yet
unable
to
send
him
any
more
detailed
information
he
had
begun
to
feel
it
strange
that
these
questions
should
be
put
to
marvel
at
the
assumption
that
they
could
in
any
way
concern
him
rickman
had
ceased
altogether
to
exist
for
him
he
was
beginning
to
lose
all
sense
of
strangeness
in
his
position
the
six
days
might
have
been
six
years
and
court
house
the
home
of
his
infancy
lucia
presence
filled
it
with
so
warm
an
atmosphere
of
kindness
and
of
love
the
very
servants
had
learnt
something
of
her
gentle
considerate
ways
he
was
at
home
there
as
he
had
never
been
at
home
before
he
knew
every
aspect
of
the
library
through
all
the
changes
of
the
light
from
the
first
waking
of
its
blues
and
crimsons
in
the
early
morning
to
the
broad
and
golden
sweep
of
noonday
through
the
south
window
from
the
quick
rushing
flame
of
the
sunset
to
its
premature
death
among
the
rafters
then
the
lamps
a
little
light
in
the
centre
where
they
sat
and
the
thick
enclosing
darkness
round
about
them
each
of
those
six
days
was
like
a
sunday
and
sunday
to
rickman
was
always
a
day
of
beatitude
being
the
day
of
dreams
and
she
in
her
sweet
unfamiliar
beauty
only
half
real
though
so
piercingly
present
to
him
was
an
incarnate
dream
she
always
sat
with
her
back
to
the
south
window
so
that
her
head
and
shoulders
appeared
somewhat
indistinct
against
the
outer
world
a
background
of
and
green
grass
and
sky
covered
with
the
of
the
leaded
lozenge
panes
and
the
watery
shimmer
of
the
glass
the
outline
of
her
head
was
indicated
by
a
little
line
of
light
that
threaded
her
hair
and
tipped
the
curve
of
her
small
ears
he
knew
every
change
of
her
face
from
its
serene
morning
look
to
its
pallor
in
the
dusk
he
knew
only
too
well
its
look
under
the
after
a
hard
day
work
the
look
that
came
with
a
slight
blurring
of
its
soft
contours
and
a
drooping
of
tired
eyelids
over
pathetic
eyes
he
saw
what
jewdwine
had
failed
to
see
that
lucia
was
not
strong
six
days
and
three
days
before
that
nine
days
in
all
and
it
was
as
if
he
had
known
that
face
all
his
life
he
could
not
conceive
a
time
when
he
had
not
known
it
as
for
the
things
he
had
known
horrible
curious
and
incredible
things
such
as
rickman
downey
pancras
church
and
the
editor
of
whose
last
letter
he
had
left
unanswered
they
belonged
to
an
infinitely
remote
and
unimaginable
past
it
seemed
the
entirely
obvious
and
natural
thing
that
he
should
be
sitting
there
alone
with
lucia
harden
he
was
never
very
far
from
her
the
east
window
looked
across
the
courtyard
to
the
window
of
her
he
could
see
her
there
sitting
in
the
he
could
hear
the
music
that
she
made
her
bedroom
was
above
the
library
it
was
pleasant
to
him
to
know
that
when
she
left
him
it
was
to
sleep
there
overhead
the
deep
quiet
of
his
passion
had
drawn
him
again
into
his
dream
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
woke
up
and
broke
the
silence
it
was
ten
on
saturday
evening
lucia
had
shifted
the
shade
of
the
lamp
from
where
he
sat
her
face
was
in
twilight
and
her
body
in
darkness
he
had
got
up
to
put
a
book
into
its
place
when
he
saw
her
leaning
back
and
covering
her
eyes
with
her
hand
the
sight
was
too
much
for
him
he
came
up
and
stood
beside
her
miss
harden
i
do
like
this
i
i
ca
stand
it
any
longer
she
looked
up
she
had
been
unaware
of
rickman
for
the
last
hour
and
certainly
did
not
expect
to
find
him
there
what
is
it
that
you
ca
stand
to
see
you
working
from
morning
to
night
it
it
is
right
you
know
you
paying
me
for
this
and
doing
the
half
of
it
yourself
i
not
doing
a
quarter
of
it
you
forget
that
you
working
three
times
as
fast
as
i
can
and
you
forget
that
you
working
three
times
as
hard
no
i
leaving
the
hard
work
to
you
i
wish
you
leave
it
all
to
me
in
that
case
we
should
never
have
finished
said
the
lady
he
smiled
perhaps
not
at
any
rate
you
worked
so
hard
that
i
can
finish
it
now
by
myself
she
looked
round
the
room
undisguised
fatigue
was
in
the
look
what
they
had
done
was
nothing
to
what
they
had
yet
to
do
you
ca
she
said
i
can
easily
i
miscalculated
the
time
it
would
take
she
said
nothing
for
she
knew
that
he
had
lied
his
miscalculation
was
all
the
other
way
she
bent
again
over
her
work
it
was
all
that
he
could
do
not
to
lift
her
arms
gently
but
firmly
from
the
table
to
take
away
her
pen
and
ink
and
put
out
her
lamp
he
would
have
liked
to
have
done
some
violence
to
the
catalogue
i
say
you
know
you
make
yourself
you
burning
the
candle
at
both
ends
may
i
suggest
that
the
game
is
worth
the
candle
have
you
very
much
more
to
do
about
two
hours
work
would
it
be
impertinent
to
say
that
i
could
do
it
better
by
myself
she
looked
at
her
watch
and
ignored
his
last
question
you
ca
do
two
hours
work
it
twenty
minutes
past
your
time
already
past
his
time
indeed
as
if
he
had
been
working
past
his
time
every
night
since
he
came
she
had
grown
mighty
particular
all
of
a
sudden
the
presence
of
these
engaging
little
elzevirs
is
a
terrible
temptation
to
a
bookseller
still
i
believe
you
can
trust
me
with
them
alone
from
the
expression
of
her
face
he
gathered
that
this
remark
was
even
more
impertinent
than
the
other
he
had
meant
it
to
be
i
really
think
said
the
lady
that
you
had
better
go
just
as
you
please
i
shall
only
have
to
sit
up
two
hours
later
night
he
walked
to
his
place
with
his
head
thrown
farther
back
and
his
chin
thrust
farther
forward
than
ever
he
began
to
sort
and
arrange
his
papers
preparatory
to
his
departure
it
took
him
five
minutes
at
the
end
of
the
five
minutes
he
was
aware
that
lucia
had
risen
and
was
bidding
him
you
were
quite
right
she
was
saying
i
tired
and
i
had
better
leave
off
if
you
had
rather
stay
and
finish
please
stay
at
those
words
rickman
was
filled
with
a
monstrous
and
amazing
courage
he
made
for
the
door
crossing
without
a
tremor
the
whole
length
of
the
library
he
reached
the
door
before
miss
harden
and
opened
it
he
returned
her
with
a
hope
that
she
would
be
rested
in
the
morning
and
as
he
went
back
to
his
solitary
labour
he
smiled
softly
to
himself
a
smile
of
he
had
meant
her
to
go
and
she
had
gone
upstairs
in
her
room
overhead
lucia
communed
with
her
own
face
in
the
glass
my
private
secretary
the
face
in
the
glass
looked
dubious
of
course
i
would
rather
have
a
gentleman
for
my
private
secretary
some
people
would
say
he
is
a
gentleman
she
had
said
it
herself
the
other
day
the
face
in
the
glass
smiled
dimly
between
two
parted
veils
of
hair
what
a
gentleman
the
face
in
the
glass
suggested
that
this
was
indeed
a
subtle
and
a
difficult
question
it
was
not
his
business
if
i
chose
to
tire
myself
would
it
have
been
his
business
if
he
been
a
gentleman
the
face
in
the
glass
offered
no
opinion
i
think
i
like
him
best
when
he
impertinent
he
is
so
funny
poor
dear
when
he
tries
to
be
polite
the
face
in
the
glass
framed
by
two
white
arms
raising
a
column
of
hair
was
suffused
with
rosy
mirth
i
wonder
what
horace
really
thinks
of
him
the
face
triumphantly
crowned
with
its
dark
coil
looked
grave
he
a
gentleman
at
least
he
lied
like
one
by
this
time
lucia
was
in
bed
and
there
was
no
face
in
the
glass
to
dispute
or
corroborate
that
statement
chapter
xxiii
the
next
morning
he
gave
into
her
hands
the
manuscript
of
in
it
had
arrived
two
or
three
days
ago
packed
by
spinks
between
his
new
shirts
she
had
expected
to
feel
a
little
guilty
as
she
received
the
familiar
sheets
but
as
she
glanced
over
them
she
saw
that
they
were
anything
but
familiar
what
she
had
to
deal
with
was
a
clean
new
draft
she
had
a
fairly
clear
recollection
of
the
outline
of
the
play
in
act
i
helen
lands
in
the
enchanted
island
of
leuce
and
is
found
watching
the
ship
that
brought
her
sailing
away
with
the
dead
menelaus
for
he
being
altogether
mortal
may
not
follow
her
there
the
chorus
tells
the
story
of
helen
her
rape
by
theseus
her
marriage
with
menelaus
her
flight
with
paris
the
tragedy
of
troy
and
her
return
to
argos
it
tells
how
through
all
her
adventures
the
godhead
in
her
remained
pure
untouched
holding
itself
apart
in
act
ii
helen
is
asleep
for
the
soul
of

still
troubles
her
divinity
and

upon

out
of
her
sleep
her
divinity
is
seen
struggling
with
her
mortality
burning
through
the
beauty
of
her
body
desire
wakens
in
achilles
and
in
helen
terror
and
anguish
as
of
one
about
to
enter
again
into
the
pain
of
mortal
life
but
he
may
not
touch
her
till
he
too
has
put
on
immortality
helen
prays
for
deliverance
from
the
power
of
aphrodite
she
rouses
in
achilles
a
great
anger
against
aphrodite
by
reminding
him
of
the
death
of
patroclus
so
that
he
calls
down
upon
the
goddess
the
curses
of
all
the
generations
of
men

read
but
she
had
gathered
from
the
argument
that
pallas
athene
was
there
to
appear
to
achilles
and
divest
him
of
his
mortality
that
she
was
to
lead
him
to
helen
whose
apotheosis
was
supposed
to
be
complete
the
act
concluding
with
two
choruses
an
epithalamium
celebrating
the
wedding
of
helen
and
achilles
and
a
hymn
in
praise
of
athene
she
remembered
how
when
horace
had
first
told
her
of
the
subject
helen
in
leuce
she
had
looked
it
up
in
lemprière
found
a
reference
in
homer
and
another
in
euripides
had
shaken
her
head
and
said
what
can
he
make
of
that
now
for
the
first
time
she
saw
what
he
had
made
of
it
rickman
helen
was
to
the
helena
of
euripides
what
shelley
prometheus
is
to
the
prometheus
of
æschylus
rickman
had
done
what
seemed
good
in
his
own
eyes
he
had
made
his
own
metres
his
own
myth
and
his
own
drama
a
drama
of
flesh
and
blood
a
drama
of
spirit
a
drama
of
dreams
only
a
very
young
poet
could
have
had
the
courage
to
charge
it
with
such
a
weight
of
symbolism
but
he
had
contrived
to
breathe
into
his
symbols
the
breath
of
life
the
phantoms
of
his
brain
a
shadowy
helen
and
achilles
turned
into
flesh
and
blood
under
his
hands
it
was
as
if
their
bodies
warm
throbbing
instinct
with
irresistible
and
violent
life
had
come
crashing
through
the
delicate
fabric
of
his
dream
as
she
read
lucia
mind
was
troubled
shaken
out
of
its
critical
serenity
she
heard
a
new
music
she
felt
herself
in
the
grasp
of
a
new
power
a
new
spirit
it
was
not
the
classic
spirit
there
was
too
much
tumult
in
its
harmonies
as
if
the
music
of
a
whole
orchestra
had
been
torn
from
its
instruments
and
flung
broadcast
riding
triumphantly
on
the
wings
of
a
great
wind
there
were
passages
notably
the
hymn
to
aphrodite
in
the
second
act
that
brought
the
things
of
sense
and
the
terrible
mysteries
of
flesh
and
blood
so
near
to
her
that
she
flinched
rickman
had
made
her
share
the
thrilling
triumph
the
flushed
passion
of
his
youth
and
when
she
was
most
hurt
and
bruised
under
the
confusion
of
it
he
lifted
her
up
and
carried
her
away
into
the
regions
of
spiritual
beauty
and
eternal
strength
it
was
all
over
the
tumult
of
the
flesh
and
the
agony
of
the
spirit
over
too
the
singing
the
rapture
of
spirit
and
of
flesh
made
one
rickman
had
ended
his
amazing
drama
with
the
broad
majestic
music
of
his
hymn
to
athene
lucia
had
borne
up
under
the
parting
of
helen
and
menelaus
but
she
was
young
and
at
that
touch
of
superb
and
ultimate
beauty
two
tears
the
large
and
heavy
tears
of
youth
fell
upon
rickman
immaculate
manuscript
where
their
marks
remain
to
this
day
the
sight
of
them
had
the
happy
effect
of
making
her
laugh
and
then
and
not
till
then
she
thought
of
rickman
rickman
she
thought
of
him
living
a
dreadful
life
among
dreadful
people
she
thought
of
him
sitting
in
his
father
shop
making
catalogues
she
thought
of
him
sitting
in
the
library
making
one
at
that
very
moment
and
this
was
the
man
she
had
had
the
impertinence
to
pity
whom
horace
would
say
she
now
proposed
to
patronize
as
she
stood
contemplating
the
pile
of
manuscript
before
her
miss
lucia
harden
felt
for
a
great
lady
quite
absurdly
small
in
that
humble
mood
she
was
found
by
miss
palliser
what
up
said
kitty
kitty
that
little
man
in
there
he
written
the
most
beautiful
play
it
so
terribly
sad
what
the
play
no
the
little
man
it
a
classic
kitty
it
live
then
i
sure
you
need
pity
him
let
have
a
look
at
the
thing
miss
palliser
dipped
into
the
manuscript
and
was
lost
by
jove
she
said
it
does
look
ripping
where
does
the
sadness
come
in
he
thinks
he
never
write
another
well
perhaps
he
wo
he
will
think
of
it
he
a
genius
the
real
thing
this
time
only
he
has
to
stand
behind
a
counter
and
make
catalogues
miss
palliser
meditated
does
he
does
he
by
any
chance
drop
his
aitches
kitty
he
then
lucy
dear
child
beware
beware
his
flashing
eyes
his
floating
hair
do
that
little
man
is
on
my
mind
i
should
let
him
stop
there
too
long
if
i
were
you
he
might
refuse
to
get
on
i
must
do
something
for
him
and
i
must
do
it
now
what
i
do
not
much
i
imagine
i
i
think
i
ask
him
to
dinner
i
would
you
said
he
drops
his
aitches
weave
said
miss
palliser
a
circle
round
him
thrice
and
close
your
eyes
with
holy
dread
but
whatever
you
do
do
ask
him
to
dinner
why
not
because
ten
to
one
it
would
make
him
most
horribly
uncomfortable
not
that
that
matters
so
much
but
would
the
faithful
robert
think
it
a
little
odd
robert
is
too
faithful
to
think
anything
at
all
i
not
so
sure
of
that
personally
i
wish
you
ask
him
to
dinner
i
seem
to
foresee
a
certain
amount
of
amusing
incident
well
i
do
think
i
will
ask
him
to
dinner
perhaps
he
enjoy
it
but
as
i
got
to
talk
over
his
play
with
him
i
should
like
to
ask
him
to
something
ask
him
to
coffee
afterwards
coffee
hardly
seems
enough
it
depends
serve
it
festively
on
a
table
and
pour
it
out
yourself
offer
him
strange
and
bewitching
forms
of
food
comfort
him
with
with
angel
cake
and
savoury
sandwiches
and
bread
and
butter
i
see
a
sort
of
compromise
exactly
society
my
child
is
based
on
compromise
very
well
then
i
write
him
a
note
she
wrote
it
and
sent
robert
with
it
to
the
library
i
suppose
said
she
it
about
time
to
dress
for
dinner
do
make
yourself
too
pretty
dear
lucia
looked
back
through
the
doorway
i
shall
make
myself
as
pretty
as
ever
i
can
he
has
had
nothing
but
ugly
things
to
look
at
all
his
life
miss
palliser
apostrophized
the
departing
figure
of
her
friend
oh
lucy
lucy
what
an
angelic
little
fool
you
chapter
xxiv
six
and
miss
harden
had
not
yet
appeared
in
the
library
it
was
the
first
time
that
rickman
had
passed
a
whole
day
without
seeing
her
he
began
to
be
uneasy
to
wonder
whether
she
were
really
at
seven
he
was
leaving
the
house
as
usual
for
his
hotel
when
robert
brought
him
a
little
note
dear
rickman
it
said
dear
mr
rickman
you
see
i
have
taken
your
advice
and
given
myself
a
holiday
i
have
spent
it
very
pleasantly
reading
in
it
would
give
me
much
pleasure
if
you
would
come
in
for
coffee
this
evening
about
eight
we
can
then
talk
it
over
very
truly
yours
lucia
harden
you
need
only
send
a
verbal
answer
a
verbal
answer
no
that
would
never
do
he
could
not
trust
himself
with
speech
but
in
writing
he
knew
he
was
impeccable
dear
miss
harden
how
very
kind
of
you
but
i
am
sorry
that
you
did
not
give
yourself
a
complete
rest
i
should
be
sorrier
if
i
were
not
so
grateful
for
the
trouble
you
have
taken
it
will
give
me
great
pleasure
to
come
in
this
evening
at
the
time
you
name
with
many
thanks
yours
very
truly
rickman
he
was
not
pleased
with
it
it
erred
on
the
side
of
redundancy
he
had
not
attained
the
perfect
utterance
the
supreme
simplicity
but
he
was
obliged
to
let
it
go
two
hours
later
robert
announced
that
coffee
was
served
in
the
it
seemed
that
to
reach
the
you
had
to
cross
the
whole
length
of
the
house
from
west
to
east
in
this
passage
he
realized
what
his
mind
had
not
greatly
dwelt
upon
the
antiquity
of
the
hardens
and
the
march
of
their
splendid
generations
going
from
the
tudor
library
into
the
grim
stone
hall
of
the
court
house
he
took
a
cold
plunge
backward
into
time
thence
his
progress
was
straightforward
bringing
him
into
the
jacobean
picture
gallery
that
cut
the
house
from
north
to
south
here
he
paused
perceiving
that
the
double
line
of
portraits
began
with
a
vandyck
and
a
lely
robert
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
brass
rose
knob
of
an
oak
door
in
his
eternal
attitude
of
affection
mingled
with
immobile
respect
he
waited
for
the
moment
when
rickman
should
elect
to
tear
himself
from
the
lely
and
the
vandyck
the
moment
came
and
rickman
heard
himself
announced
in
a
clear
high
voice
as
he
passed
over
the
threshold
he
found
himself
in
a
long
room
that
room
whose
west
window
looked
out
across
the
courtyard
to
the
east
window
of
the
library
it
was
almost
dark
except
for
a
small
square
at
the
far
end
lucia
was
sitting
in
a
low
chair
by
the
fireplace
under
the
tall
shaded
lamp
where
the
light
fell
full
on
her
shoulders
she
was
not
alone
on
a
settee
by
the
other
side
of
the
open
hearth
sat
the
young
lady
who
had
intruded
on
his
solitude
in
the
library
the
presence
of
the
young
lady
filled
him
with
anxiety
and
dismay
he
had
to
cross
a
vast
dim
space
before
he
reached
that
lighted
region
with
what
seemed
to
him
a
reeling
and
uncertain
gait
he
approached
over
the
perilously
slippery
parquet
miss
harden
rose
and
came
forward
mercifully
cutting
short
that
frightful
passage
from
the
threshold
to
her
chair
lucia
had
not
carried
out
the
intention
she
had
announced
to
kitty
she
had
dressed
in
haste
but
in
rickman
eyes
the
effect
was
that
which
kitty
had
seen
fit
to
deprecate
she
had
made
herself
very
pretty
indeed
he
could
not
have
given
a
very
clear
account
of
it
could
not
have
said
whether
the
thing
she
wore
that
floating
sweeping
curling
trailing
folding
and
caressing
garment
were
made
of
grey
gossamer
in
white
or
white
in
grey
but
he
was
aware
that
it
showed
how
divinely
her
slender
body
carried
its
flower
her
head
showed
that
her
arms
her
throat
and
the
first
sweep
and
swell
of
her
shoulders
were
of
one
tone
with
the
luminous
pallor
of
her
face
something
in
the
dress
in
her
bearing
and
manner
of
approach
gave
her
the
assured
charm
of
womanhood
for
the
unfinished
loveliness
of
youth
she
introduced
him
to
her
friend
miss
palliser
whose
green
eyes
smiled
in
recognition
he
bowed
with
the
stiffness
of
a
back
unaccustomed
to
that
form
of
salutation
he
hardly
knew
what
happened
after
that
till
he
found
himself
backing
nervously
ridiculously
backing
into
a
lonely
seat
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
three
were
now
grouped
in
a
neat
geometrical
figure
rickman
on
the
chair
of
his
choice
forming
the
apex
of
a
prolonged
triangle
having
the
hearthrug
for
its
base
he
was
aware
that
miss
harden
and
miss
palliser
were
saying
something
but
he
had
no
idea
of
what
they
said
he
sat
there
wondering
whether
he
ought
to
be
seated
at
all
whether
he
ought
not
rather
to
be
hovering
about
that
little
table
ready
to
wait
upon
miss
palliser
he
was
still
wondering
when
miss
palliser
got
up
with
the
evident
intention
of
waiting
upon
him
that
he
knew
was
all
wrong
it
was
not
to
be
permitted
for
a
moment
inspired
by
a
strange
unnatural
courage
he
advanced
and
took
his
coffee
from
her
hand
retreating
with
it
to
his
remote
and
solitary
position
he
sat
silent
moodily
looking
at
his
coffee
stirring
it
from
time
to
time
and
wondering
whether
he
would
ever
be
brave
enough
to
drink
it
he
waited
for
an
opportunity
of
dispatching
it
unperceived
the
presence
of
miss
palliser
paralysed
him
he
wondered
whether
he
ought
to
say
anything
to
her
or
to
miss
harden
or
to
neither
or
to
both
he
tried
to
think
of
something
suitable
to
say
meanwhile
miss
palliser
talked
for
all
three
it
seemed
that
she
had
dined
with
her
friend
on
her
way
to
an
at
home
in
harmouth
bread
and
butter
said
she
judicially
n
no
i
think
not
thanks
i
got
to
eat
jellies
and
sandwiches
and
things
for
two
hours
straight
on
end
it
sounds
horrible
but
i
shall
be
driven
to
it
at
the
flossers
she
explained
for
her
friend
benefit
you
must
either
eat
or
talk
and
if
you
ca
talk
scandal
you
not
expected
to
talk
at
all
and
still
talking
miss
palliser
slowly
bore
down
upon
rickman
with
a
plate
of
bread
and
butter
rickman
earnest
and
chivalrous
endeavour
to
forestall
her
caused
a
rug
to
slide
under
his
feet
it
slid
and
rickman
with
it
for
quite
a
considerable
distance
and
though
rickman
indeed
preserved
the
erect
attitude
by
a
series
of
complicated
movements
a
superb
triumph
of
muscular
ingenuity
but
somewhat
curious
and
fantastic
as
a
spectacle
his
coffee
cup
flung
itself
violently
on
its
side
and
poured
out
its
contents
at
the
lady
feet
he
looked
at
miss
harden
she
was
smiling
for
who
would
have
smiled
but
her
smile
became
almost
tender
in
her
perception
of
his
distress
miss
palliser
continued
to
talk
ah
said
miss
palliser
i
was
waiting
for
that
to
happen
i
been
wondering
which
of
us
would
do
it
first
i
rather
thought
it
would
be
me
but
for
pure
delightful
unexpectedness
give
me
a
parquet
floor
i
would
mop
it
up
with
my
pocket
handkerchief
if
i
were
you
no
please
it
does
matter
it
happens
every
day
and
it
puts
a
visitor
on
an
agreeable
footing
at
once
you
keep
up
any
stiffness
or
formality
when
what
you
took
for
a
turns
itself
into
a
skating
rink
quite
so
said
rickman
and
if
you
fall
it
breaks
the
ice
he
was
entering
shyly
into
her
humour
i
afraid
my
quite
so
and
spontaneous
as
it
might
have
been
i
assure
you
it
was
extremely
naïve
and
natural
as
far
as
it
went
said
kitty
laughing
i
think
you
were
very
clever
to
keep
your
balance
said
lucia
too
clever
by
half
if
you
been
a
really
genial
person
rickman
you
have
lost
it
thus
lightly
did
they
cover
his
confusion
thus
adroitly
turn
the
malignant
hand
of
circumstance
kitty
said
lucia
i
do
want
to
hurry
you
but
it
past
nine
and
you
to
hurry
if
you
do
want
to
be
late
but
i
do
want
to
be
late
i
mean
to
be
late
i
ca
eat
sandwiches
for
more
than
two
hours
and
kitty
flung
herself
on
her
settee
again
in
crosslegged
unpremeditated
ease
and
there
she
conversed
with
rickman
as
if
she
had
known
him
all
her
life
kitty
was
amused
at
last
so
was
rickman
he
found
himself
answering
with
appropriate
he
heard
himself
laughing
in
the
manner
of
one
infinitely
at
ease
it
was
impossible
to
be
anything
else
in
kitty
palliser
society
he
was
in
fact
surprised
though
it
was
only
by
immense
expenditure
of
thought
and
effort
that
he
managed
to
secure
the
elusive
aspirate
still
he
secured
it
never
for
a
moment
did
he
allow
himself
to
be
cheated
into
the
monstrous
belief
that
its
absence
was
or
could
be
unperceived
but
though
he
was
grateful
to
miss
palliser
he
wished
all
the
time
that
she
would
go
at
last
she
rose
and
drew
her
cloak
about
her
with
a
slow
reluctant
air
well
i
suppose
i
must
be
off
i
shall
be
back
before
eleven
lucy
rickman
if
i
do
see
you
again
he
was
alone
with
lucia
harden
it
was
one
thing
to
be
alone
with
lucia
harden
in
the
library
or
on
harcombe
moor
and
quite
another
thing
to
be
left
with
her
in
that
room
the
library
belonged
to
her
race
and
to
their
historic
past
the
moor
to
nature
and
to
all
time
this
room
to
her
and
to
the
burning
present
there
was
no
sign
or
suggestion
of
another
presence
a
kindly
room
barring
that
parquet
floor
a
beautiful
room
full
of
warm
lights
and
broad
and
pleasing
shadows
furnished
with
an
extreme
simplicity
such
bareness
as
musicians
love
he
was
struck
by
that
absence
of
all
trivial
decoration
all
disturbing
and
irrelevant
detail
in
such
a
room
the
divinity
of
the
human
form
was
not
dwarfed
or
obscured
by
excess
of
furniture
such
a
room
he
reflected
was
also
eminently
disadvantageous
to
any
figure
that
was
not
entirely
sure
of
its
divinity
but
for
two
persons
who
desired
to
know
each
other
better
there
could
be
a
better
place
it
left
them
so
securely
so
intimately
alone
for
the
first
time
then
he
was
alone
with
lucia
harden
she
had
risen
and
had
unlocked
a
drawer
in
the
near
her
and
taken
out
the
thick
pile
of
manuscript
he
noticed
that
she
detached
from
it
some
loose
pencilled
sheets
and
put
them
back
into
the
drawer
she
seated
herself
in
her
old
place
and
signed
to
him
to
take
the
low
chair
beside
her
he
approached
her
for
the
first
time
without
nervousness
or
embarrassment
for
he
saw
his
lying
on
her
knees
and
knew
that
she
held
his
dreams
in
her
soul
he
had
made
her
acquainted
with
the
best
and
highest
in
him
and
she
would
judge
him
by
that
alone
in
her
sight
his
genius
would
stand
apart
from
all
in
him
that
was
jarring
and
obscure
it
at
least
was
untouched
by
the
accident
of
his
birth
the
baseness
of
his
false
position
i
sent
for
you
said
she
because
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
this
while
it
is
all
fresh
in
my
mind
i
thought
we
could
talk
better
here
thanks
i
want
awfully
to
know
what
you
have
to
say
i
ca
have
anything
to
say
that
you
do
know
already
i
i
know
nothing
what
a
hypocrite
he
felt
as
he
said
it
nor
i
as
far
as
knowledge
goes
i
have
any
right
to
speak
only
the
other
evening
you
expressed
such
absolute
disbelief
in
yourself
i
was
perfectly
sincere
i
know
you
were
that
what
made
me
believe
in
you
well
then
if
was
what
made
her
believe
in
him
he
would
continue
to
express
disbelief
in
himself
she
paused
it
the
little
men
is
it
the
men
of
talent
that
are
always
so
and
so
sure
i
do
know
much
about
it
but
it
seems
to
me
that
genius
is
bound
to
be
like
that
it
might
be
so
different
from
your
ordinary
self
that
you
could
be
aware
of
it
in
the
ordinary
way
there
would
always
be
a
sort
of
divine
uncertainty
about
it
i
afraid
i
do
agree
with
you
all
the
great
geniuses
have
been
not
only
aware
of
themselves
but
most
uncommonly
certain
still
their
genius
may
have
been
the
part
of
themselves
they
understood
least
if
they
had
tried
to
understand
it
they
would
have
doubted
too
there
something
in
that
you
mean
genius
understands
everything
except
itself
i
think
that
what
i
meant
yes
but
whether
genius
understands
itself
or
not
whatever
it
does
you
see
it
does
doubt
does
it
have
you
read
keats
letters
doubted
only
when
he
was
in
love
with
fanny
brawne
he
paused
abruptly
he
was
seized
by
an
idea
a
rushing
irresistible
idea
that
lifted
him
off
his
feet
and
whirled
him
suddenly
into
a
region
of
light
tumultuous
and
profound
keats
was
in
love
when
he
doubted
could
that
be
the
explanation
of
his
own
misgiving
that
he
said
hastily
that
another
thing
altogether
any
way
if
you
do
believe
in
yourself
you
have
some
difficulty
in
making
other
people
believe
in
you
and
if
other
people
believe
in
you
before
you
believe
in
yourself
before
it
might
be
done
before
but
not
after
you
may
make
a
man
conceited
but
you
ca
give
him
back
the
conceit
he
had
on
saturday
if
he
lost
it
all
by
monday
that
means
that
you
know
you
written
a
beautiful
thing
and
you
only
think
you
never
write
another
perhaps
it
does
he
had
to
keep
it
up
for
the
pleasure
of
hearing
her
say
she
believed
in
him
well
i
do
suppose
you
will
write
another
in
i
afraid
not
he
went
on
to
tell
her
that
the
wonder
was
how
he
wrote
the
thing
at
all
it
had
been
done
anyhow
anywhere
in
successive
bursts
or
spasms
of
creative
energy
the
circumstances
of
his
life
he
referred
to
them
with
some
diffidence
not
being
exactly
favourable
to
sustained
effort
how
did
feel
about
it
he
inquired
i
can
hardly
tell
you
i
think
i
felt
as
you
feel
about
anything
beautiful
that
comes
to
you
for
the
first
time
i
do
know
what
it
is
you
done
it
as
if
something
had
been
done
to
me
as
if
been
given
a
new
sense
it
like
hearing
beethoven
or
wagner
for
the
first
time
as
she
spoke
she
saw
the
swift
blood
grow
hot
in
his
face
she
saw
the
slight
trembling
of
the
hand
that
propped
his
chin
and
she
thought
poor
fellow
so
much
emotion
for
a
little
praise
what
did
you
mean
by
it
she
said
he
considered
a
moment
as
who
should
say
what
the
dickens
did
i
mean
by
it
lucia
leaned
back
now
for
the
first
time
in
the
breathing
space
he
gave
her
attentively
watching
the
man
she
proposed
to
make
her
secretary
and
as
she
watched
him
she
found
herself
defending
him
against
her
own
criticism
if
he
dropped
his
aitches
it
was
not
grossly
as
the
illiterate
do
she
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
he
them
he
slipped
them
slided
them
it
was
no
more
than
a
subtle
slur
a
delicate
elision
and
that
only
in
the
commoner
words
the
current
coin
of
his
world
he
was
as
right
as
possible
she
noticed
in
all
words
whose
acquaintance
he
had
made
on
his
own
account
and
his
voice
his
voice
pleaded
against
her
prejudice
with
all
its
lyric
modulations
much
may
be
forgiven
to
such
voices
and
there
were
other
points
in
his
favour
kitty
was
right
he
was
nice
to
look
at
she
was
beginning
to
know
the
changes
of
his
face
she
liked
it
best
when
as
now
its
features
became
suddenly
subtle
and
serious
and
straight
at
the
moment
his
eyes
almost
opaque
from
the
thickness
of
their
blue
were
dull
under
the
shadow
of
the
but
when
he
grew
excited
as
he
frequently
did
they
had
a
way
of
clearing
suddenly
they
flashed
first
colour
at
you
then
light
then
fire
that
was
what
they
were
doing
now
for
now
he
let
himself
go
his
helen
he
said
was
the
eternal
beauty
the
eternal
dream
beauty
perpetually
desirous
of
incarnation
perpetually
unfaithful
to
flesh
and
blood
the
dream
that
longs
for
the
embrace
of
reality
that
wanders
never
satisfied
till
it
finds
a
reality
as
immortal
as
itself
helen
could
stay
in
the
house
of
theseus
or
the
house
of
menelaus
or
the
house
of
priam
theseus
was
a
fool
if
he
thought
he
would
take
her
by
force
and
paris
was
a
fool
if
he
thought
he
could
keep
her
for
pleasure
and
menelaus
was
the
biggest
fool
of
all
if
he
expected
her
to
bear
him
children
and
to
mind
his
house
they
all
do
violence
to
the
divinity
in
her
and
she
vindicates
it
by
eluding
them
her
vengeance
is
the
vengeance
of
an
immortal
made
victim
to
mortality
helen
of
argos
and
troy
is
the
dream
divorced
from
reality
yes
yes
i
see
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
fascinated
while
the
wonderful
voice
went
on
covering
its
own
offences
with
exquisite
resonances
and
overtones
this
divorce
is
the
cause
of
all
the
evil
that
can
happen
to
men
and
women
because
of
it
helen
becomes
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
aphrodite
venus
genetrix
do
you
see
she
the
the
destroyer
of
men
she
brings
war
and
pestilence
and
death
she
is
the
supreme
illusion
but
in
is
the
true
helen
in
leuce
you
know
she
appears
as
she
is
in
her
divine
form
freed
from
the
tyranny
of
perpetual
incarnation
i
ca
explain
it
but
that
the
idea
do
you
see
how
the
chorus
in
praise
of
aphrodite
breaks
off
into
a
prayer
for
deliverance
from
her
and
at
the
end
i
make
athene
bring
helen
to
achilles
who
was
her
enemy
in
that
part
of
the
idea
too
and
achilles
achilles
is
strength
virility
indestructible
it
seemed
that
while
trivial
excitement
corrupted
intense
feeling
purified
his
speech
and
as
he
pronounced
these
words
every
accent
was
irreproachable
a
lyric
exaltation
seemed
to
have
seized
him
as
it
had
seized
him
in
the
reading
of
sophocles
the
idea
is
reconciliation
the
wedding
of
the
dream
to
reality
i
have
made
up
my
mind
whether
the
last
chorus
will
be
the
epithalamium
or
the
hymn
to
pallas
athene
he
paused
for
reflection
and
in
reflection
the
lyric
rapture
died
he
added
pensively
the
i
think
lucia
averted
her
ardent
gaze
before
the
horror
in
his
young
blue
eyes
they
were
the
eyes
of
some
wild
winged
creature
dashed
down
from
its
soaring
and
frenzied
by
the
fall
lucia
could
have
wept
for
him
then
this
said
she
feigning
an
uninterrupted
absorption
in
the
manuscript
this
is
not
what
my
cousin
saw
no
h
he
only
saw
the
first
draft
of
the
two
first
acts
it
was
horribly
stiff
and
cold
he
said
it
was
classical
i
do
know
what
he
say
it
is
now
i
began
it
that
way
and
it
finished
itself
this
way
and
then
i
the
beginning
i
see
i
see
something
happened
to
you
as
she
spoke
she
still
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
manuscript
as
if
she
were
only
reading
what
was
written
there
you
woke
up
in
the
middle
of
the
second
act
it
and
came
to
life
you
heard
the
world
the
real
world
calling
to
you
and
helen
and
achilles
and
all
the
rest
of
them
turned
to
flesh
and
blood
on
your
hands
yes
he
said
they
were
only
symbols
and
i
no
notion
what
they
meant
till
they
left
off
meaning
it
she
looked
from
the
manuscript
to
him
you
know
in
your
heart
you
be
certain
of
yourself
and
yet
i
suspect
the
trouble
with
you
is
that
dream
is
divorced
from
reality
he
stared
in
amazement
at
the
young
girl
who
thus
interpreted
him
to
herself
at
this
rate
he
saw
no
end
to
her
powers
of
divination
there
were
depths
in
his
life
where
her
innocence
could
not
penetrate
but
she
had
seized
on
the
essential
it
had
been
as
she
had
said
that
first
draft
was
the
work
of
the
young
scholar
poet
the
adorer
of
classic
form
the
dreamer
who
found
in
his
dreams
escape
from
the
grossness
of
his
own
lower
nature
and
from
the
brutalities
of
the
world
he
lived
in
a
great
drama
was
to
be
his
protest
against
modernity
and
actuality
then
came
an
interval
of
a
year
in
which
he
learnt
many
things
that
are
not
to
be
found
in
books
or
adequately
expressed
through
drama
and
the
thing
was
finished
and
at
a
time
when
as
she
had
said
something
had
happened
to
him
when
that
same
gross
actual
world
was
making
its
claims
felt
through
all
his
senses
and
he
was
suffering
now
the
deep
melancholy
of
perspicuous
youth
unable
to
part
with
its
dreams
but
aware
that
its
dreams
are
hopelessly
divorced
from
reality
that
was
so
but
how
on
earth
did
she
know
it
it
hardly
a
divorce
he
said
laughing
i
think
it
separation
by
mutual
consent
that
a
pity
said
she
life
is
so
lovable
i
do
always
find
it
either
lovable
or
loving
but
then
it
life
in
a
in
bloomsbury
if
you
know
what
that
is
she
did
not
know
what
that
was
and
her
silence
suggested
that
she
conceived
it
to
be
something
too
unpleasant
to
discuss
with
him
i
work
eight
hours
a
day
in
my
father
shop
and
when
your
work
is
done
i
go
back
to
the
and
dine
and
after
dinner
rickman
became
visibly
embarrassed
oh
after
dinner
there
are
the
streets
and
the
theatres
and
and
things
nothing
else
nothing
except
a
club
i
belong
to
that
something
is
it
you
make
friends
i
do
know
anybody
in
it
except
jewdwine
and
i
do
really
know
him
it
the
shop
you
know
you
forget
the
shop
no
i
do
forget
it
but
i
wish
you
would
if
only
you
could
get
away
from
it
away
from
everything
if
you
could
get
away
from
london
altogether
for
a
while
if
if
i
shall
never
get
away
why
not
i
been
thinking
it
over
i
wonder
whether
things
could
not
be
made
a
little
easier
for
you
you
ought
to
make
your
peace
with
the
world
you
know
supposing
you
could
go
and
live
where
the
world
happens
to
be
beautiful
in
rome
or
florence
or
venice
would
that
reconcile
you
to
reality
it
might
but
i
do
see
how
i
to
go
and
live
there
you
see
there
the
shop
there
always
is
the
shop
would
it
be
impossible
to
leave
it
for
a
little
while
not
impossible
perhaps
but
he
smiled
well
highly
imprudent
but
if
something
else
were
open
to
you
nothing
else
is
at
present
most
doors
seem
closed
pretty
tight
except
the
one
marked
tradesmen
entrance
you
ca
by
that
not
i
admit
with
any
dignity
my
idea
was
to
walk
up
the
steps
there
are
a
great
many
steps
i
know
to
the
big
front
door
and
keep
on
knocking
at
it
till
they
let
me
in
i
afraid
the
front
door
is
always
open
very
early
in
the
day
but
there
may
be
side
doors
i
do
know
where
to
find
them
and
if
i
did
they
would
be
bolted
too
not
the
one
i
am
thinking
of
would
you
like
to
go
abroad
to
italy
there
are
a
great
many
things
i
should
like
to
do
and
not
the
remotest
chance
of
doing
them
supposing
that
you
got
the
chance
some
way
even
if
it
was
quite
the
best
way
would
you
take
it
the
chance
i
wish
i
saw
one
i
think
i
told
you
i
was
going
abroad
to
join
my
father
we
shall
be
in
italy
for
some
time
when
we
are
settled
in
rome
for
the
winter
i
shall
want
a
secretary
i
thinking
of
editing
my
unpublished
writings
and
i
ca
do
this
without
a
scholar
help
it
struck
me
that
if
you
want
to
go
abroad
and
nothing
better
turns
up
you
might
care
to
take
this
work
for
a
year
for
the
sake
of
seeing
italy
seeing
italy
italy
that
he
had
once
desired
with
all
his
heart
to
see
and
now
it
was
nothing
to
him
that
he
would
see
italy
the
point
was
that
he
would
see
her
talk
of
open
doors
it
was
dawning
on
him
that
the
door
of
heaven
was
being
opened
to
him
he
could
say
nothing
he
leaned
forward
staring
at
his
own
loosely
clasped
hands
she
mistook
his
silence
for
hesitation
and
it
was
her
turn
to
become
diffident
and
shy
the
salary
would
not
be
very
large
i
afraid
the
salary
he
smiled
she
had
opened
the
door
of
heaven
for
him
and
she
actually
proposed
to
pay
him
for
walking
in
but
there
would
be
no
expenses
and
you
would
have
space
and
time
i
should
not
want
your
help
for
more
than
three
or
four
hours
in
the
morning
after
that
you
would
be
absolutely
free
and
still
he
said
nothing
but
the
fine
long
nervous
hands
tortured
each
other
in
their
clasp
so
this
was
what
came
of
keeping
up
the
farce
of
course
she
said
you
must
think
it
over
miss
harden
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
i
do
know
what
to
say
do
say
anything
think
i
do
know
what
to
think
but
he
was
thinking
hard
trying
to
realize
where
he
was
and
what
was
being
proposed
to
him
to
have
entertained
the
possibility
of
such
a
proposal
in
the
middle
of
last
week
would
have
argued
that
he
was
drunk
and
here
he
was
indubitably
conspicuously
sober
sober
well
not
exactly
he
ought
never
to
have
taken
that
little
cup
of
black
coffee
was
there
any
difference
between
drinking
champagne
with
miss
poppy
grace
and
drinking
coffee
with
lucia
harden
when
the
effect
was
so
indistinguishably
the
same
or
rather
for
completeness
and
splendour
of
hallucination
there
was
no
comparison
he
was
drunk
drunk
as
he
had
never
been
drunk
before
most
luminously
most
divinely
intoxicated
with
that
little
cup
of
black
coffee
and
yet
her
scheme
was
entirely
in
keeping
with
that
ideal
and
fantastic
world
he
lived
in
a
world
which
in
the
last
six
days
had
yet
for
him
the
illusion
of
reality
he
was
aware
that
it
illusion
an
illusion
which
she
blindly
shared
he
was
overcome
by
the
appalling
extent
of
his
knowledge
and
her
ignorance
she
thought
she
was
rich
he
knew
that
she
was
in
all
probability
poor
she
thought
a
hundred
a
year
or
thereabouts
an
insignificant
sum
he
knew
that
before
long
she
might
have
less
than
that
to
live
on
she
thought
herself
at
the
present
moment
a
wise
and
understanding
woman
he
knew
that
she
was
a
child
a
child
playing
with
its
own
beautiful
imagination
he
wondered
how
much
of
him
she
understood
should
he
tell
her
that
she
did
not
understand
him
at
all
that
she
was
engaging
as
her
private
secretary
a
young
man
who
drank
who
was
quite
shockingly
drunk
no
longer
ago
than
the
middle
of
last
week
a
young
man
who
was
an
intimate
friend
of
a
lady
whom
it
was
impossible
to
describe
accurately
in
her
presence
or
did
she
understand
him
better
than
he
understood
himself
had
she
with
her
child
innocence
the
divine
lucidity
of
a
child
did
she
fail
to
realize
his
baser
possibilities
because
they
were
the
least
real
part
of
him
or
was
she
in
this
ideal
and
fantastic
too
whichever
it
was
her
fascination
was
so
persuasive
that
he
found
himself
yielding
to
her
proposal
as
if
it
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
he
accepted
it
as
humbly
as
gratefully
as
gravely
as
if
it
were
a
thing
actually
in
her
power
to
bestow
if
he
could
have
suspected
her
of
any
intention
to
patronize
him
he
could
not
have
resented
it
knowing
as
he
did
its
pathetic
impotence
i
know
it
is
the
best
way
she
said
but
it
a
way
it
a
glorious
way
i
do
know
about
the
glory
but
you
will
see
florence
and
venice
and
rome
and
they
are
glorious
yes
he
would
see
them
if
she
said
so
why
not
in
this
ideal
and
fantastic
world
could
any
prospect
be
more
ideal
and
fantastic
than
another
and
you
will
have
plenty
of
time
to
yourself
you
will
be
a
great
deal
alone
too
much
alone
perhaps
you
must
think
of
that
it
might
really
be
better
for
you
to
stay
in
london
where
you
are
beginning
to
make
friends
was
she
trying
to
break
it
to
him
as
gently
as
delicately
as
possible
that
there
would
be
no
intimacy
between
him
and
her
that
as
her
private
secretary
his
privacy
would
be
painfully
unbroken
she
saw
it
and
corrected
herself
friends
i
mean
who
may
be
able
to
help
you
more
you
must
choose
between
the
two
advantages
it
will
be
a
complete
break
with
your
old
life
that
would
be
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
to
me
this
time
she
did
not
see
well
do
be
in
a
hurry
there
is
any
hurry
remember
it
means
a
whole
year
out
of
your
life
a
whole
year
out
of
his
life
was
that
the
way
she
looked
at
it
yes
she
was
giving
him
his
chance
but
she
did
not
conceive
herself
to
be
giving
him
anything
more
she
understood
him
sufficiently
to
trust
him
her
insight
went
so
far
and
no
farther
she
actually
believed
that
there
could
be
a
choice
for
him
between
seeing
her
every
day
for
a
whole
year
and
never
seeing
her
again
evidently
she
had
not
the
remotest
conception
of
his
state
of
mind
he
doubted
whether
it
could
have
occurred
to
her
to
allow
for
the
possibility
of
her
private
secretary
falling
in
love
with
her
in
the
innermost
privacy
of
his
secretaryship
he
saw
that
hers
was
not
the
order
of
mind
that
entertains
such
possibilities
on
an
intimate
footing
she
was
generous
he
understood
that
she
would
let
herself
be
carried
away
on
the
superb
sweep
of
the
impersonal
reckless
of
contingencies
he
also
understood
that
with
this
particular
private
secretary
she
would
consider
herself
safe
the
social
difference
was
as
much
her
protection
as
some
preposterous
incompatibility
of
age
and
as
if
that
were
not
enough
in
their
thoughts
they
were
so
akin
that
she
might
feel
herself
guarded
from
him
by
some
law
of
spiritual
consanguinity
oh
my
life
he
said
with
a
queer
short
laugh
that
sounded
like
a
sob
well
i
must
be
getting
back
to
my
work
you
are
going
to
work
again
i
must
yet
he
did
not
get
up
to
go
he
seemed
to
be
waiting
to
say
something
i
i
have
thanked
you
i
do
know
how
to
do
try
i
done
nothing
there
is
little
that
one
person
can
do
for
another
there
something
that
you
might
do
for
me
some
day
if
i
might
ask
if
you
would
what
is
that
she
followed
his
gaze
as
it
travelled
into
the
depth
of
the
room
beyond
the
circle
of
the
where
the
grand
piano
stood
its
keyboard
shone
in
an
even
band
of
white
its
massive
body
merged
in
the
gleaming
darkness
if
you
would
play
to
me
some
day
i
will
play
to
you
with
pleasure
her
voice
sounded
as
if
she
were
breathing
more
freely
perhaps
she
had
wondered
what
on
earth
he
was
going
to
say
now
if
you
like
why
not
if
she
had
enjoyed
his
music
had
he
not
a
right
to
enjoy
hers
why
should
she
not
give
him
that
little
pleasure
he
who
had
so
few
what
shall
i
play
i
should
like
to
hear
that
thing
you
were
playing
the
other
night
let
me
think
oh
the
sonata
appassionata
yes
if
it
is
too
late
the
moment
he
had
said
it
he
reflected
that
that
was
a
scruple
that
might
have
been
better
left
to
the
lady
he
watched
her
figure
departing
into
the
dusk
of
the
room
he
longed
to
follow
but
some
fear
restrained
him
he
remained
where
he
was
leaning
back
in
the
deep
chair
under
the
lamp
while
she
sat
down
there
in
the
dusk
playing
to
him
the
sonata
appassionata
the
space
around
the
lamp
grew
dim
to
him
she
had
gathered
into
herself
all
the
whiteness
of
the
flame
the
music
was
a
part
of
her
radiance
it
was
the
singing
of
her
pulses
the
rhythm
of
her
breath
when
she
had
stopped
playing
he
rose
and
held
out
his
hand
to
say
thank
you
i
do
think
so
badly
of
my
life
now
you
given
me
one
perfect
moment
are
you
so
fond
of
music
she
was
about
to
ring
when
he
prevented
her
please
do
ring
i
can
find
my
way
i
rather
she
judged
that
he
desired
to
keep
the
perfection
of
his
moment
unimpaired
she
understood
his
feeling
about
it
for
the
sonata
appassionata
is
a
most
glorious
and
moving
composition
and
she
had
played
it
well
it
was
true
that
he
desired
to
be
alone
and
he
took
advantage
of
his
solitude
to
linger
in
the
picture
gallery
he
went
down
the
double
row
of
portraits
that
began
with
sir
thomas
the
maker
of
madrigals
and
ended
with
sir
frederick
the
father
of
lucia
he
paused
at
each
searching
for
lucia
likeness
in
the
likeness
of
those
dead
and
gone
gentlemen
and
ladies
gentlemen
with
grave
and
intellectual
faces
some
peevish
others
proud
rather
like
jewdwine
ladies
with
faces
joyous
dreamy
sad
voluptuous
tender
and
insipid
faces
alike
only
in
their
indestructible
racial
distinction
lucia
had
taken
nothing
from
them
but
what
was
beautiful
and
fine
hers
was
the
unconscious
beauty
of
the
race
beauty
of
flesh
and
blood
purified
spiritualized
in
its
passage
through
the
generations
beauty
that
gives
the
illusion
of
eternity
being
both
younger
and
older
than
the
soul
it
was
as
if
nature
had
become
art
in
the
making
of
lucia
forming
her
by
the
subtlest
processes
of
selection
and
rejection
having
gone
the
round
of
the
gallery
he
paused
before
the
modern
portraits
which
brought
him
again
to
the
door
of
the
sir
frederick
held
him
with
his
joyous
for
it
was
curiously
incredibly
like
his
daughter
to
be
sure
sir
frederick
had
blue
eyes
and
reddish
hair
which
made
a
difference
his
eyebrows
had
a
hint
of
her
she
lingered
in
the
tilted
corners
of
his
mouth
and
eyes
and
if
there
could
be
any
likeness
between
a
thing
so
gross
and
a
thing
so
spiritual
his
upper
lip
took
a
sweep
that
suggested
lucia
with
its
subtle
curve
he
was
startled
out
of
these
reflections
by
the
opening
of
the
door
lucia
stood
beside
him
she
had
a
lamp
in
her
hand
which
she
raised
for
an
instant
so
that
the
light
fell
full
upon
the
portrait
her
own
face
appeared
as
if
illuminated
from
within
by
the
flaming
spirit
of
love
that
is
my
father
she
said
simply
and
passed
on
he
looked
again
at
the
portrait
but
the
likeness
had
vanished
in
the
frank
sensuality
of
sir
frederick
crimson
smirk
he
could
find
no
affinity
to
lucia
grave
and
tender
smile
there
are
some
things
he
said
to
himself
that
she
could
never
see
chapter
xxv
if
lucia
was
not
as
her
father
had
pronounced
her
the
worst
educated
young
woman
in
europe
there
was
a
sense
not
intended
by
sir
frederick
in
which
her
education
might
be
called
incomplete
she
had
learnt
the
things
that
she
liked
and
she
had
left
unlearnt
the
things
that
she
did
not
like
it
was
the
method
of
discreet
skipping
and
it
answered
so
well
in
the
world
of
books
that
she
had
applied
it
to
the
world
of
men
and
women
she
knew
the
people
she
liked
and
she
left
unknown
those
whom
she
did
not
like
here
in
harmouth
her
peculiar
art
or
instinct
of
selection
earned
for
her
as
kitty
palliser
had
lately
told
her
the
character
of
exclusiveness
this
by
the
way
was
family
tradition
again
from
time
immemorial
there
had
been
a
certain
distance
between
court
house
and
the
little
georgian
town
and
when
harmouth
was
discovered
by
a
and
became
a
and
people
began
to
talk
about
harmouth
society
court
house
remained
innocently
unaware
that
anything
of
the
sort
existed
lucia
selected
her
friends
elsewhere
with
such
supreme
fastidiousness
that
she
could
count
them
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand
her
instinct
like
all
great
natural
gifts
being
entirely
spontaneous
and
unconscious
and
now
it
seemed
she
had
added
savage
keith
rickman
to
the
list
she
owned
quite
frankly
that
in
spite
of
everything
she
liked
him
but
rickman
was
right
lucia
with
all
her
insight
had
not
the
remotest
conception
of
his
state
of
mind
the
acquaintance
had
arisen
quite
naturally
out
of
her
desire
to
please
horace
and
if
on
this
there
supervened
a
desire
to
please
rickman
there
was
not
a
particle
of
vanity
in
it
she
had
no
thought
of
being
inspiration
her
attitude
to
his
genius
was
humbly
reverent
her
attitude
to
his
manhood
profoundly
unconscious
she
had
preserved
a
most
formidable
innocence
there
had
been
nothing
in
horace
slow
and
courtship
to
stir
her
senses
or
give
her
the
smallest
inkling
of
her
own
power
that
way
kitty
suggestion
seemed
to
her
preposterous
it
was
only
the
kittishness
of
kitty
and
could
have
no
possible
application
to
herself
all
this
was
not
humility
on
her
part
nothing
of
the
sort
so
far
from
being
humble
miss
lucia
harden
held
the
superb
conviction
that
any
course
she
adopted
was
consecrated
by
her
adoption
it
was
as
if
she
had
been
aware
that
her
nature
was
rich
and
that
she
could
afford
to
do
what
other
women
could
there
were
ways
she
would
say
of
doing
them
and
in
savage
keith
rickman
she
had
divined
a
nature
no
less
generously
gifted
he
could
afford
to
take
what
she
could
afford
to
offer
better
still
he
would
take
just
so
much
and
no
more
with
some
people
certain
possibilities
were
moral
miracles
and
her
instinct
told
her
that
this
man
mind
was
incapable
of
vulgar
misconception
she
was
safe
with
him
these
things
she
pondered
during
that
brief
time
when
rickman
lingered
in
the
portrait
gallery
he
saw
her
again
that
night
for
yet
another
moment
lucia
was
called
back
into
the
picture
gallery
by
the
voice
of
kitty
palliser
whose
return
coincided
with
his
departure
kitty
from
the
safe
threshold
of
the
looked
back
after
his
retreating
figure
poor
darling
he
has
dressed
himself
with
care
he
always
does
he
has
broken
every
literary
convention
lucia
drew
kitty
into
the
room
and
shut
the
door
has
he
been
trying
any
more
experiments
in
diminished
friction
on
polished
surfaces
no
there
was
a
good
deal
more
repose
about
him
after
you
left
the
friction
was
decidedly
diminished
what
do
you
think
of
him
oh
i
rather
like
the
way
he
drops
his
aitches
it
gives
a
pathetic
piquancy
to
his
conversation
do
kitty
i
wo
but
after
all
how
do
we
know
that
this
young
man
is
not
a
fraud
how
do
we
know
anything
oh
if
you
going
to
be
metaphysical
off
to
my
little
bed
not
yet
kitty
sit
down
and
toast
your
toes
i
want
to
talk
to
you
all
right
fire
away
but
lucia
hesitated
kitty
was
in
an
unpropitious
mood
what
do
you
think
i
done
she
said
kitty
green
eyes
danced
merrily
but
in
spite
of
their
mockery
lucia
told
her
tale
it
was
the
best
i
could
do
said
she
kitty
eyes
had
left
off
dancing
lucia
you
it
impossible
you
must
go
on
being
so
kind
to
people
remember
dear
if
he
is
a
genius
not
he
really
not
a
gentleman
i
know
i
thought
of
that
but
if
he
is
a
gentleman
he
the
other
thing
he
something
by
himself
i
admit
he
a
genius
but
he
drops
his
aitches
he
does
drop
half
as
many
as
he
did
he
only
does
it
when
flustered
and
i
wo
let
him
be
flustered
i
shall
be
very
kind
to
him
oh
groaned
kitty
there
no
possible
doubt
about
that
on
the
whole
i
think
i
rather
glad
he
is
a
gentleman
he
would
be
much
more
likely
to
get
in
my
way
if
he
were
i
do
believe
this
little
man
would
get
in
my
way
he
got
eyes
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
nerves
all
over
him
he
see
in
a
minute
when
i
did
want
him
he
see
it
before
i
did
and
be
off
you
do
know
you
might
have
to
be
very
unpleasant
to
him
before
you
said
no
i
should
never
have
to
be
unpleasant
to
him
because
he
would
know
that
would
be
very
unpleasant
for
me
all
this
might
mean
that
he
was
a
gentleman
but
i
afraid
it
only
means
that
he
a
genius
genius
of
that
sort
said
lucia
comes
to
very
much
the
same
thing
and
kitty
reluctantly
admitted
that
it
did
she
sat
silent
for
some
minutes
gazing
into
the
fire
lucia
does
it
never
occur
to
you
that
in
your
passion
for
giving
pleasure
you
may
be
giving
a
great
deal
of
pain
it
does
occur
to
me
that
i
giving
either
in
this
case
and
it
will
not
occur
to
him
he
knows
i
only
giving
him
his
chance
i
owe
it
him
kitty
when
you
only
think
what
i
done
i
taken
this
wonderful
beautiful
delicate
thing
and
set
it
down
to
the
most
abominable
drudgery
for
three
weeks
no
wonder
he
was
depressed
and
i
took
his
easter
from
him
kitty
think
his
one
happy
in
the
whole
hateful
year
whitsuntide
and
christmas
yet
remain
they
not
at
all
the
same
thing
that
you
lucy
all
over
you
bagged
his
bank
holiday
and
you
think
you
got
to
give
him
a
year
in
italy
to
make
up
not
altogether
to
make
up
well
i
do
know
what
to
say
there
no
doubt
you
can
do
a
great
many
things
other
women
ca
still
it
certainly
seems
a
risky
thing
to
do
how
risky
i
do
want
to
be
coarse
but
i
not
humbugging
this
time
supposing
merely
supposing
he
falls
in
love
with
you
what
then
but
he
wo
how
do
you
know
because
he
in
love
already
in
love
with
perfection
but
as
he
be
sure
to
identify
perfection
with
you
he
will
see
very
little
of
me
then
he
all
the
more
likely
to
kitty
i
the
sort
of
woman
who
allows
that
sort
of
thing
to
happen
with
that
sort
of
man
my
dear
you
the
sort
of
woman
who
treats
men
as
if
they
were
disembodied
spirits
and
that
the
most
dangerous
sort
i
know
if
i
not
mistaken
savage
keith
rickman
spirit
is
very
much
embodied
what
the
good
of
trying
to
make
me
uncomfortable
when
it
all
settled
i
ca
go
back
on
my
word
no
i
suppose
you
got
to
stick
to
it
unless
of
course
your
father
interferes
father
never
interferes
did
you
ever
know
him
in
his
life
refuse
me
anything
i
wanted
i
ca
say
i
ever
did
kitty
tone
intimated
that
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
if
he
sometimes
had
still
sir
frederick
objects
strongly
to
people
who
interfere
with
him
and
he
may
not
care
to
have
the
young
savage
poet
or
poet
savage
hanging
about
father
he
wo
mind
a
bit
he
says
he
going
to
take
part
of
the
palazzo
barberini
for
six
months
it
big
enough
to
hold
fifty
poets
not
big
enough
to
hold
one
like
savage
keith
rickman
kitty
rose
to
her
feet
she
stood
majestic
for
the
spirit
of
prophecy
was
upon
her
she
gathered
herself
together
for
the
deliverance
of
her
soul
you
say
he
wo
be
in
the
way
he
will
he
be
most
horribly
in
the
way
he
go
sliding
and
falling
all
over
the
place
and
dashing
cups
of
coffee
on
the
marble
floor
of
the
palazzo
he
wind
his
feet
in
the
tails
of
your
best
gowns
not
out
of
any
malice
but
in
sheer
nervous
panic
he
do
unutterable
things
with
soup
i
can
see
him
doing
them
i
ca
no
i
know
you

i
do
say
you
no

i
say
you
deficient

kind

chapter
xxvi
it
was
extraordinary
if
he
had
given
himself
time
to
reflect
on
it
he
might
even
have
considered
it
uncanny
the
peace
that
had
settled
on
him
with
regard
to
the
harden
library
it
remained
absolutely
unshaken
by
the
growing
agitation
of
his
father
letters
isaac
wrote
reproachfully
irritably
frantically
and
received
only
the
briefest
most
unsatisfactory
replies
i
tell
you
anything
more
than
i
have
but
i
would
be
in
a
hurry
to
make
any
arrangements
with
pilkington
if
i
were
you
not
the
smallest
reference
to
the
aldine
plato
the
neapolitan
horace
or
the
of
wynkyn
de
worde
why
indeed
should
he
trouble
himself
he
could
understand
his
father
state
of
mind
he
had
now
a
positive
intuition
that
sir
frederick
would
recover
in
the
manner
of
a
gentleman
whose
motto
was
an
infinite
assurance
was
conveyed
by
that
tilted
smile
he
even
found
himself
believing
in
his
own
delightful
future
as
miss
harden
private
secretary
so
entirely
had
he
submitted
to
the
empire
of
divine
possibility
meanwhile
he
redoubled
his
attentions
to
the
catalogue
could
there
be
anything
more
unreasonable
than
that
catalogue
he
had
frequently
got
up
and
worked
at
it
for
an
hour
or
two
before
breakfast
lifted
out
of
bed
by
the
bounding
of
his
heart
but
whereas
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
leaving
it
at
any
time
between
nine
and
midnight
he
now
sat
up
with
it
till
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
this
extreme
devotion
was
necessary
if
he
was
to
finish
it
by
the
it
was
now
the
fifteenth
he
had
told
miss
harden
that
he
could
work
better
by
himself
and
apparently
she
had
taken
him
at
his
word
she
had
left
him
to
finish
the
catalogue
alone
as
it
happened
he
did
work
a
bit
better
by
himself
what
with
speculating
on
the
chance
of
her
appearing
listening
for
her
voice
and
her
footsteps
on
the
stairs
or
the
distant
sound
of
her
playing
to
say
nothing
of
his
desperate
efforts
not
to
stare
out
of
the
windows
when
he
knew
her
to
be
in
the
garden
lucia
absent
was
even
more
disturbing
than
lucia
on
the
spot
he
tried
to
console
himself
with
the
reflection
that
she
was
no
longer
overworking
herself
and
herein
appeared
the
great
purity
and
of
rickman
love
rather
than
see
her
making
herself
ill
he
was
actually
manoeuvring
so
as
not
to
see
her
at
all
he
kept
his
vigils
secret
having
a
suspicion
that
if
she
heard
of
them
she
would
insist
on
returning
to
her
hideous
task
to
this
end
he
devised
an
ingenious
system
of
deceit
he
left
off
work
for
an
hour
every
afternoon
alleging
his
need
of
air
and
exercise
he
then
asked
permission
to
sit
up
a
little
later
than
usual
by
way
of
making
good
the
time
thus
lost
he
knew
that
by
eleven
the
lights
would
be
out
and
lucia
and
the
servants
all
in
bed
he
demanded
black
coffee
to
keep
him
awake
and
the
key
of
the
side
door
to
let
himself
out
all
on
the
understanding
that
he
would
leave
the
house
by
eleven
or
twelve
at
the
latest
he
could
thus
put
in
a
good
five
hours
extra
without
any
one
being
any
the
wiser
and
four
would
find
rickman
stealing
back
to
his
hotel
over
the
grey
and
dewy
grass
for
three
days
and
three
nights
love
miraculous
energy
sustained
him
on
the
fourth
night
he
was
overcome
by
a
slight
fatigue
and
at
one
he
lay
down
on
the
hearth
rug
to
sleep
registering
in
his
brain
his
intention
to
wake
punctually
at
two
and
for
three
days
and
three
nights
lucia
hardly
gave
a
thought
to
rickman
she
was
busy
with
preparations
for
her
departure
trying
to
see
as
much
of
kitty
palliser
as
possible
and
thinking
a
great
deal
of
that
adorable
father
whom
she
would
meet
on
the
lucia
room
as
rickman
knew
was
in
the
west
wing
over
the
end
of
the
library
and
from
her
window
she
could
see
the
pale
yellow
green
shaft
of
light
that
rickman
lamp
flung
across
the
lawn
the
clock
on
the
stable
belfry
struck
the
hours
one
by
one
and
lucia
fast
asleep
never
knew
that
the
shaft
of
light
lay
there
until
the
dawn
on
the
fourth
night
the
night
of
thursday
the
fifteenth
lucia
did
not
sleep
so
well
she
dreamed
but
her
dreams
were
too
light
and
transparent
to
veil
the
reality
that
lay
on
the
waking
side
of
them
three
times
that
night
she
started
on
her
journey
to
cannes
three
times
she
missed
her
train
and
three
times
she
said
to
herself
only
a
dream
so
of
course
it
does
matter
when
after
prodigious
efforts
extending
over
interminable
time
she
found
herself
on
harmouth
platform
shuddering
in
her
nightgown
before
a
whole
train
full
of
people
she
was
not
in
the
least
disconcerted
because
of
her
perception
of
that
reality
behind
her
dream
no
not
even
when
rickman
appeared
just
as
she
was
saying
to
herself
it
matter
this
is
only
the
fifteenth
and
i
do
really
start
till
the
his
presence
was
so
transparent
so
insubstantial
that
it
did
seem
to
matter
either
he
said
miss
you
made
a
miscalculation
you
must
start
this
minute
if
you
to
be
there
in
time
his
statement
seemed
to
her
to
be
founded
on
some
solid
reality
but
when
she
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
there
he
spoilt
it
all
by
saying
that
as
private
secretary
he
was
in
charge
of
the
expedition
by
that
and
by
something
unnatural
and
absurd
in
his
appearance
she
knew
that
she
was
dreaming
then
for
more
time
than
she
could
measure
she
lay
watching
herself
dream
with
a
curious
sense
of
being
able
to
foretell
and
control
the
fantastic
procession
of
events
and
now
she
was
aware
of
something
that
moved
with
their
movement
a
trouble
or
a
terror
that
hovered
out
there
not
on
the
waking
border
but
in
the
region
of
reality
that
lay
on
the
other
side
almost
discernible
behind
the
transparent
insubstantial
walls
of
sleep
it
waited
to
break
through
them
and
invade
her
dream
for
refuge
from
it
she
plunged
deeper
into
her
dream
she
came
out
walking
on
a
terrace
of
grey
grass
set
with
strange
clusters
of
swords
and
tall
grey
trees
shot
up
into
a
grey
white
sky
they
were
coated
with
sharp
scales
grey
and
toothed
like
the
scales
of
a
shark
skin
and
some
bore
yet
more
swords
for
branches
slender
and
waving
swords
and
some
branchless
were
topped
with
heads
of
curled
scimitars
the
blades
pointing
downwards
all
these
scaly
spiky
things
stood
out
piercing
and
distinct
against
the
grey
and
she
knew
that
they
were
aloes
and
and
that
she
had
come
to
the
end
of
her
journey
and
was
walking
in
the
garden
of
the
villa
des
palmes
and
the
thing
she
dreaded
was
still
waiting
a
little
way
beyond
the
garden
beyond
the
insubstantial
walls
it
was
looking
for
her
crying
after
her
it
stretched
out
its
arms
to
draw
her
from
her
sleep
a
little
twilight
wind
came
creeping
over
the
grey
grass
it
covered
her
feet
like
water
it
rose
higher
and
higher
above
the
sword
points
of
the
aloes
and
she
sank
in
it
and
floated
floated
and
sank
and
now
it
tossed
and
rolled
and
shook
the
till
all
their
blades
rattled
like
steel
and
beyond
the
wind
she
heard
the
calling
of
the
thing
she
feared
the
thing
that
had
hunted
her
from
dream
to
dream
she
feared
it
no
longer
she
too
was
looking
and
crying
all
her
desire
was
to
find
what
she
had
feared
to
answer
it
to
see
it
face
to
face
her
body
was
clasped
tight
by
the
arms
of
the
wind
yet
her
yearning
was
so
strong
that
she
struggled
with
them
and
flung
them
from
her
breaking
through
the
bonds
and
barriers
of
sleep
lucia
was
awake
and
accounting
for
her
dream
the
weather
had
changed
in
the
night
and
a
cold
wind
was
rushing
through
the
open
window
on
to
her
bed
she
had
been
lying
with
her
feet
uncovered
and
the
heaped
on
to
her
chest
she
had
been
waked
by
the
rattling
of
a
loosened
lattice
in
the
room
below
she
got
out
of
bed
and
looked
out
of
the
window
there
was
a
vast
movement
in
the
sky
as
if
the
darkness
were
being
visibly
upheaved
and
rolled
away
westwards
by
the
wind
over
the
garden
was
the
dense
grey
blackness
of
an
obliterated
dawn
the
trees
not
yet
detached
from
the
ground
of
night
showed
like
monstrous
skeletons
of
the
whole
immense
body
of
gloom
while
the
violent
rocking
of
their
branches
made
them
one
with
that
dark
and
wandering
tumult
of
cloud
and
wind
the
shaft
of
light
no
longer
lay
upon
the
lawn
rickman
lamp
was
out
therefore
she
argued
rickman
had
gone
having
in
the
recklessness
of
his
genius
forgotten
to
close
the
library
windows
one
of
the
west
windows
creaked
and
crashed
by
turns
as
it
swung
heavily
in
its
leaded
frame
lucia
put
on
her
dressing
gown
and
slippers
threw
a
light
shawl
about
her
shoulders
and
went
down
to
fasten
the
lattice
a
small
swinging
lamp
gave
light
to
the
hall
and
staircase
a
gleam
followed
her
into
the
library
it
lay
in
a
pool
behind
her
its
thin
stream
lost
in
the
blackness
of
the
floor
she
could
distinguish
nothing
in
the
room
but
the
three
dim
white
busts
on
their
dusky
pedestals
behind
the
latticework
the
window
panes
were
like
chequered
sheets
of
liquid
twilight
let
down
over
the
face
of
the
night
the
wind
held
the
open
lattice
backwards
and
she
had
some
difficulty
in
reaching
the
hasp
a
shallow
gust
ran
over
the
floor
chilling
her
feet
as
she
leaned
out
on
the
sill
a
great
fear
came
over
her
the
fear
that
had
always
possessed
her
in
childhood
at
the
coming
and
passing
of
the
night
as
she
struggled
with
the
lattice
she
had
a
sense
of
pulling
it
against
some
detaining
hand
it
swung
slowly
round
and
the
figure
of
a
man
slid
with
it
and
stood
behind
it
looking
in
the
figure
seemed
to
lean
forward
out
of
the
darkness
its
face
pressed
close
against
the
panes
was
vivid
as
if
seen
in
a
strong
daylight
she
saw
the
flame
of
its
red
moustache
and
hair
the
flicker
of
its
tilted
smile
its
eyes
were
fixed
piercingly
on
hers
it
stood
so
for
the
space
of
six
the
window
slipped
from
her
hand
and
swung
back
on
its
hinges
the
cloud
was
heaved
from
the
edges
of
the
world
and
face
and
figure
were
wiped
out
by
the
great
grey
sweep
of
the
dawn
lucia
strangely
as
it
seemed
to
her
afterwards
was
not
startled
by
the
apparition
but
by
the
aspect
of
the
world
it
had
appeared
in
she
stood
motionless
as
if
afraid
of
waking
her
own
fear
she
caught
the
lattice
drew
it
towards
her
and
deliberately
secured
it
by
the
hasp
she
turned
with
relief
from
the
terrible
twilight
of
the
windows
to
the
darkness
of
the
room
she
crossed
it
with
slow
soft
footsteps
lest
she
should
give
her
terror
the
signal
to
pursue
there
was
a
slight
stir
on
the
hearth
as
a
mound
of
ashes
sank
and
broke
asunder
opening
its
dull
red
heart
lucia
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
came
forward
and
saw
that
she
was
not
alone
stretched
on
the
rug
in
front
of
the
fireplace
with
his
feet
towards
her
lay
rickman
her
first
feeling
was
of
relief
protection
deliverance
she
stood
looking
at
him
finding
comfort
in
the
sheer
corporeality
of
his
presence
but
as
she
looked
at
him
that
emotion
merged
in
concern
for
rickman
himself
he
lay
on
his
back
in
a
deep
sleep
one
arm
was
flung
above
his
head
the
hand
brushing
back
his
damp
hair
his
forehead
was
beaded
with
the
thick
sweat
of
exhaustion
he
must
have
been
lying
so
for
hours
having
dropped
off
to
sleep
when
the
night
was
still
warm
he
had
thrown
back
his
coat
and
loosened
his
and
lay
undefended
from
the
draught
that
raked
the
floor
the
window
at
this
end
of
the
room
had
been
left
open
too
and
the
fire
was
almost
dead
lucia
looked
doubtfully
at
the
window
she
knew
its
ways
it
sagged
on
its
hinges
and
was
not
to
be
shut
without
the
grating
shriek
of
iron
upon
stone
she
looked
still
more
doubtfully
at
rickman
his
face
in
the
strange
light
showed
white
and
sharp
and
pathetically
refined
and
as
she
looked
her
heart
was
filled
with
compassion
for
the
helpless
sleeper
she
moved
very
softly
to
the
fireplace
where
an
oak
chest
stood
open
stored
with
wood
she
gathered
the
embers
together
and
laid
on
them
a
few
light
logs
the
first
log
dropped
through
the
ashes
to
the
hearth
and
rickman
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
turned
on
his
side
lucia
knelt
there
motionless
till
his
breathing
assured
her
that
he
still
slept
with
swift
noiseless
movements
she
went
on
building
up
the
dying
fire
the
wood
crackled
a
little
flame
leapt
up
and
rickman
opened
his
eyes
for
a
moment
he
kept
them
open
fixed
in
sleepy
wonder
on
the
woman
who
knelt
beside
him
by
the
hearth
he
was
obscurely
aware
that
it
was
lucia
harden
but
his
wonder
was
free
from
the
more
vivid
and
disturbing
element
of
surprise
for
he
had
been
dreaming
about
her
and
was
still
under
the
enchantment
of
his
dream
never
had
she
seemed
more
beautiful
to
him
her
head
was
bowed
her
face
turned
from
him
and
shaded
by
her
hair
and
with
her
hands
she
tended
a
dying
flame
her
shawl
had
slipped
from
her
shoulders
and
he
saw
the
delicate
curve
of
her
body
as
she
knelt
it
was
overlaid
by
her
hair
that
fell
to
her
hips
in
a
loose
flat
braid
he
closed
his
eyes
again
feigning
abysmal
sleep
he
kept
guard
over
his
breath
over
his
eyelids
lest
a
tremor
should
startle
her
into
flight
yet
he
knew
that
she
had
risen
and
that
her
face
was
set
towards
him
that
she
turned
from
him
and
then
paused
in
her
going
that
she
looked
at
the
fire
again
to
make
sure
of
its
burning
and
at
him
to
make
sure
of
his
sleep
so
intently
that
she
never
noticed
the
white
thing
which
had
slipped
from
her
shoulders
as
she
stood
upright
that
she
stooped
to
draw
his
coat
more
closely
over
him
he
heard
the
flowing
of
her
gown
and
saw
without
seeing
her
feet
shining
as
she
went
from
him
and
his
desire
went
after
her
and
the
mere
bodiless
idea
of
her
became
a
torment
to
his
body
as
it
had
been
a
joy
to
his
soul
he
took
up
her
shawl
which
lay
there
by
the
hearth
and
looked
at
it
he
stroked
it
unfolded
it
spread
it
out
and
looked
at
it
again
he
held
it
to
his
face
its
whiteness
and
its
tender
texture
were
as
flame
to
his
sight
and
touch
the
scarcely
perceptible
scent
of
it
pierced
him
like
a
delicate
pain
he
gathered
it
up
again
in
a
heap
and
covered
it
with
kisses
then
because
it
made
his
longing
for
her
insupportable
he
flung
it
back
that
innocent
little
white
shawl
as
if
shaking
off
her
touch
and
her
presence
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
ramped
up
and
down
the
room
savagely
like
a
wild
animal
in
a
cage
with
every
thought
of
lucia
his
torment
returned
upon
him
he
tried
to
think
of
the
whiteness
and
the
beauty
of
her
soul
and
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
whiteness
of
her
face
and
the
beauty
of
her
bending
body
he
sat
down
stretched
his
arms
on
the
table
and
laid
his
miserable
head
upon
them
all
among
the
pages
of
the
catalogue
he
had
passed
from
his
agony
of
desire
to
an
agony
of
contrition
he
felt
that
the
very
vehemence
of
his
longing
was
an
affront
to
her
white
unconsciousness
up
till
now
he
had
not
admitted
that
he
was
in
love
with
lucia
he
was
indeed
hardly
aware
of
it
he
imagined
his
feeling
for
her
to
be
something
altogether
immaterial
and
incorruptible
it
now
seemed
to
him
that
in
the
last
few
minutes
he
had
lowered
it
almost
to
the
level
of
the
emotion
inspired
by
miss
poppy
grace
it
was
not
and
it
never
could
be
what
it
had
been
three
weeks
ago
why
he
could
not
even
recall
his
sensations
of
easter
sunday
that
strange
renewal
of
his
heart
virginity
his
first
vague
imperfect
vision
of
the
dawn
of
love
his
joy
when
he
discerned
its
tender
and
mysterious
approach
he
knew
that
it
held
no
rights
or
held
them
only
on
the
most
subtle
and
uncertain
tenure
that
his
soul
touched
the
soul
of
lucia
harden
by
the
extreme
tips
of
its
wings
stretched
to
the
utmost
still
his
passion
for
her
had
been
so
far
satisfied
by
that
difficult
and
immaterial
relationship
he
was
bound
to
her
by
an
immaterial
intangible
link
but
he
had
put
an
end
to
that
relationship
he
had
broken
the
immaterial
intangible
link
it
was
as
if
he
had
given
a
body
to
some
delicate
and
spiritual
dream
and
destroyed
it
in
a
furious
embrace
and
in
destroying
it
he
had
destroyed
everything
then
he
reflected
that
though
this
deed
seemed
to
belong
wholly
to
the
present
moment
it
had
in
reality
been
done
a
long
time
before
when
he
first
became
the
slave
of
that
absurd
and
execrable
passion
for
miss
poppy
grace
rickman
the
poet
had
believed
in
love
the
immortal
and
invincible
the
highest
of
high
divinities
and
as
such
had
celebrated
him
in
song
but
he
had
been
unfortunate
in
his
first
actual
experience
of
him
he
had
found
him
not
pacing
golden
floor
but
staggering
across
miss
grace
a
most
offensive
disreputable
little
god
of
course
he
knew
it
was
the
same
thing
it
was
the
same
thing
at
all
but
he
was
bound
by
his
past
he
had
forged
a
chain
of
infamous
but
irresistible
association
that
degraded
love
in
his
eyes
that
in
his
thoughts
degraded
every
hour
that
he
had
spent
in
the
little
society
had
its
kindred
with
this
hour
in
his
passion
for
lucia
harden
there
leapt
up
the
passion
of
that
night
that
night
three
weeks
ago
it
was
then
then
that
he
had
sinned
against
her
he
had
not
meant
he
had
not
meant
to
love
her
like
that
and
yet
he
perceived
how
all
along
unremittently
imperceptibly
this
passion
had
waylaid
him
and
misled
him
and
found
him
out
it
was
it
that
had
drawn
him
every
morning
across
the
fields
to
court
house
that
upheld
him
on
his
giddy
perch
on
the
library
steps
that
chained
him
to
his
chair
at
the
library
table
and
kept
him
sweating
over
that
abominable
catalogue
till
four
in
the
morning
it
had
looked
at
him
with
so
pure
and
spiritual
a
face
that
he
had
not
recognized
it
but
how
otherwise
could
he
have
stayed
here
for
three
weeks
fooling
with
that
unlucky
conscience
of
his
persuading
it
one
minute
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
miss
harden
and
that
her
father
affairs
were
no
business
of
his
the
next
that
they
were
so
much
his
business
that
he
was
bound
not
to
betray
them
while
as
for
miss
harden
he
had
so
much
to
do
with
her
that
it
was
his
duty
to
stay
where
he
was
and
protect
her
he
had
had
absolutely
no
duty
in
the
matter
except
to
tell
her
the
truth
and
clear
out
telling
the
truth
it
ought
to
have
been
easy
for
him
who
was
so
truthful
so
passionately
sincere
and
yet
almost
anything
would
have
been
easier
for
the
next
step
to
telling
the
truth
was
going
away
of
course
he
had
suffered
in
staying
but
he
would
have
suffered
anything
rather
than
go
it
had
been
so
insidious
his
feet
had
been
caught
in
a
net
so
fine
that
he
had
thought
it
woven
of
the
hairs
split
by
an
exceedingly
acute
and
subtle
conscience
he
should
have
stood
still
and
snapt
them
one
by
one
but
he
had
struggled
until
he
was
so
entangled
that
he
could
not
get
out
and
now
he
perceived
that
the
net
which
seemed
so
fine
was
the
strong
net
woven
by
desire
all
his
subtle
reasonings
his
chivalry
his
delicacy
his
sincerity
itself
could
be
reduced
to
this
simple
and
contemptible
element
positively
his
whole
character
as
he
now
contemplated
it
seemed
to
slip
away
from
him
and
dissolve
in
the
irresistible
stream
primeval
monstrous
indestructible
the
horror
of
his
position
returned
upon
him
the
burden
of
his
knowledge
and
her
ignorance
if
only
she
knew
if
only
he
could
go
to
her
and
tell
her
everything
all
that
he
knew
and
all
that
he
guessed
he
was
still
firm
in
his
conviction
that
he
had
no
moral
right
to
his
knowledge
it
was
a
thing
he
almost
seemed
to
have
come
by
dishonestly
if
miss
harden
knew
nothing
of
her
father
affairs
it
was
to
be
presumed
that
they
had
been
purposely
kept
from
her
to
save
her
pain
he
had
no
right
to
tell
her
no
matter
he
would
tell
her
he
would
tell
her
this
morning
and
having
told
her
he
would
go
away
he
got
up
and
paced
to
and
fro
again
he
stood
before
the
open
window
till
he
had
chilled
himself
through
then
he
came
back
and
cowered
over
the
fire
a
white
thing
lay
by
the
hearth
at
his
feet
it
was
lucia
harden
shawl
lying
crumpled
where
he
had
thrown
it
it
was
the
sign
and
symbol
of
her
presence
there
it
was
also
the
proof
of
it
how
would
she
feel
if
she
knew
that
he
had
been
aware
of
it
all
the
time
the
fact
remained
that
she
had
risked
his
waking
there
was
comfort
for
him
in
that
she
had
always
been
kind
to
him
and
he
had
never
had
even
a
momentary
illusion
as
to
the
source
and
the
nature
of
her
kindness
he
had
taken
it
as
he
had
taken
her
extreme
courtesy
for
the
measure
of
the
distance
that
divided
them
it
showed
her
secure
in
her
detachment
her
freedom
from
any
intimate
thought
of
him
from
any
thought
of
him
at
all
but
in
this
last
act
of
kindness
it
could
hardly
be
that
she
had
not
taken
him
into
consideration
she
could
hardly
have
been
pleased
if
she
knew
he
had
been
awake
yet
she
had
risked
his
waking
before
she
risked
it
she
must
have
credited
him
with
something
of
her
own
simplicity
of
soul
and
this
was
how
he
had
repaid
her
he
saw
her
as
she
had
knelt
by
him
mending
the
dying
fire
as
she
had
stood
looking
at
him
as
she
had
stooped
over
him
to
cover
him
and
as
she
had
turned
away
and
he
saw
himself
sinning
as
he
had
sinned
against
her
in
his
heart
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
average
man
would
have
felt
no
compunction
whatever
upon
this
head
to
the
average
man
his
imagination
if
he
has
any
is
an
unreal
thing
to
rickman
it
was
the
most
real
thing
about
him
it
was
so
young
and
in
its
youth
so
ungovernably
creative
that
it
flung
out
its
ideas
as
it
were
alive
and
kicking
it
was
only
partially
true
of
him
that
his
dream
was
divorced
from
reality
for
with
him
the
phantoms
of
the
mind
which
to
the
average
man
are
merely
phantoms
projected
themselves
with
a
bodily
vividness
and
violence
not
only
had
they
the
colour
and
authority
of
accomplished
fact
they
were
invested
with
an
immortality
denied
to
facts
his
imagination
was
in
this
so
far
spiritual
that
it
perceived
desire
to
be
the
eternal
soul
of
the
deed
and
the
deed
to
be
but
the
perishing
body
of
desire
from
this
point
of
view
conduct
may
figure
as
comparatively
unimportant
therefore
this
point
of
view
is
very
properly
avoided
by
the
average
man
rickman
now
reduced
to
the
last
degree
of
humility
and
contrition
picked
up
lucia
shawl
very
gently
and
reverently
and
folded
it
with
care
smoothing
out
the
horrid
creases
he
had
made
in
it
he
took
it
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
laid
it
over
the
back
of
her
chair
so
that
it
might
look
to
robert
as
if
his
mistress
had
left
it
there
would
he
see
her
again
that
morning
that
depended
on
the
amount
of
work
that
remained
for
her
to
do
he
looked
over
her
table
her
tray
was
empty
the
slips
were
pinned
together
in
bundles
in
the
way
he
had
taught
her
section
xii
poetry
was
complete
there
was
nothing
now
to
keep
her
in
the
library
and
he
had
only
ten
days
work
to
do
he
might
see
her
once
or
twice
perhaps
on
those
days
but
she
would
not
sit
with
him
nor
work
with
him
and
when
the
ten
days
were
over
she
would
go
away
and
he
would
never
see
her
again
then
he
remembered
that
he
had
got
to
tell
her
and
go
away
himself
at
once
this
very
morning
meanwhile
he
sat
down
and
worked
till
it
was
time
to
go
back
to
his
hotel
he
worked
mechanically
miserably
oppressed
alike
by
his
sense
of
his
own
villainy
and
of
the
futility
of
his
task
he
did
not
know
how
when
it
was
ended
he
was
to
take
up
this
kind
of
work
again
he
had
only
been
kept
up
by
his
joy
in
her
presence
and
in
her
absence
by
the
hope
of
her
return
but
he
could
not
bear
to
look
into
a
future
in
which
she
had
no
part
chapter
xxvii
he
found
a
letter
from
dicky
pilkington
waiting
for
him
at
the
hotel
dicky
subtlety
seemed
to
have
divined
his
scruples
for
he
gave
him
the
information
he
most
wanted
in
terms
whose
terseness
left
very
little
room
for
uncertainty
look
sharp
wrote
dicky
and
let
me
know
if
you
made
up
your
great
mind
about
that
library
if
freddy
harden
does
pay
up
i
shall
have
to
put
my
men
in
on
the
between
you
and
me
there
is
the
ghost
of
a
chance
for
freddy
i
hear
the
unlucky
devil
just
cleaned
himself
out
at
monte
carlo
the
it
was
the
day
when
miss
harden
was
to
join
her
father
at
cannes
the
coincidence
of
dates
was
significant
it
amounted
to
proof
it
meant
that
sir
frederick
must
have
long
anticipated
the
catastrophe
and
that
he
had
the
decency
to
spare
her
the
last
painful
details
she
would
not
have
to
witness
the
invasion
of
the
vandals
the
overturning
of
the
household
gods
and
the
defilement
of
their
sacred
places
well
he
thought
bitterly
they
could
be
much
more
defiled
than
they
were
already
he
saw
himself
as
an
abominable
object
a
thing
with
a
double
face
and
an
unclean
and
aitchless
tongue
sitting
there
from
morning
to
night
spying
calculating
appraising
with
a
view
to
fraud
at
least
that
was
how
she
would
think
of
him
when
she
knew
and
he
had
got
to
tell
her
he
was
on
the
rack
again
and
the
wonder
was
how
he
had
ever
left
it
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
never
have
been
long
released
at
any
time
he
had
had
moments
of
comparative
ease
when
he
could
lie
on
it
at
one
end
of
the
room
and
see
lucia
sitting
at
the
other
and
the
sight
of
her
must
have
soothed
his
agony
he
had
had
moments
of
forgetfulness
of
illusion
when
he
had
gone
to
sleep
on
the
rack
and
had
dreamed
the
most
delicious
dreams
moments
even
of
deliverance
when
his
conscience
exhausted
with
the
sheer
effort
of
winding
had
dropped
to
sleep
too
and
then
had
come
the
reckless
moments
when
he
had
yielded
himself
wholly
to
the
delight
of
her
presence
and
that
supreme
instant
when
his
love
for
lucia
seemed
to
have
set
him
free
and
now
it
was
love
itself
furiously
accusing
that
flung
him
back
upon
the
torture
and
stretched
him
out
further
than
he
had
been
stretched
before
but
dicky
letter
had
to
be
answered
at
once
he
settled
dicky
for
the
present
by
reminding
him
that
nothing
could
be
done
by
either
of
them
till
the
but
he
thought
that
if
sir
frederick
or
any
of
his
family
were
unable
to
pay
up
there
ought
to
be
no
difficulty
in
arranging
with
his
father
to
his
father
he
sent
a
word
of
warning
for
goodness
sake
commit
yourself
with
pilkington
until
you
see
me
i
shall
probably
be
back
in
town
afternoon
having
settled
dicky
he
breakfasted
bathed
was
a
little
long
over
his
dressing
taking
care
that
nothing
in
his
appearance
should
suggest
the
dishevelled
person
of
the
dawn
thus
he
was
rather
later
than
usual
in
presenting
himself
at
the
library
he
found
miss
harden
there
at
his
end
of
the
table
with
his
busy
over
his
pile
and
engaged
in
finishing
his
section
philosophy
her
clear
and
candid
eyes
greeted
him
without
a
shadow
of
remembrance
she
had
always
this
air
of
accepting
him
provisionally
for
the
moment
only
as
if
her
kindness
had
no
springs
in
the
past
and
could
promise
nothing
for
the
future
he
had
always
found
this
manner
a
little
distressing
and
it
baffled
him
completely
now
still
in
another
minute
he
would
have
to
tell
her
whatever
her
manner
or
her
mood
miss
harden
he
began
you
been
so
awfully
good
to
me
something
that
i
want
most
awfully
to
say
to
you
well
say
it
but
there
was
that
in
her
tone
which
warned
him
not
to
be
too
long
about
it
it
something
i
ought
to
have
said
to
have
confessed
ages
ago
oh
no
really
rickman
if
it
a
confession
you
must
do
it
now
we
shall
never
finish
at
this
rate
when
may
i
some
time
in
the
afternoon
perhaps
her
smile
which
was
exceedingly
subtle
disconcerted
him
inexpressibly
she
turned
at
once
to
the
business
of
the
day
the
question
was
whether
he
would
begin
on
a
new
section
or
finish
this
one
with
her
writing
at
her
dictation
he
too
was
calm
detached
he
strangled
a
happy
smile
which
suggested
that
her
question
was
absurd
to
start
a
new
section
was
to
work
gloomily
by
himself
at
some
distant
quarter
of
the
room
to
write
to
her
dictation
was
to
be
near
her
soothed
by
her
voice
and
made
forgetful
by
her
eyes
hypocritically
he
feigned
a
reflection
as
if
it
were
a
matter
for
hesitation
and
for
choice
would
you
find
it
less
tiring
if
i
read
and
you
wrote
no
i
had
better
read
you
can
write
faster
than
i
can
so
he
wrote
his
fastest
while
lucia
harden
read
out
titles
to
him
in
the
sonorous
latin
tongue
she
was
standing
in
gnostics
and
as
for
rickman
he
was
as
he
observed
out
of
his
depth
there
altogether
iamblichus
mysteriis
do
you
know
him
rickman
smiled
as
he
admitted
that
his
acquaintance
with
iamblichus
was
of
the
slightest
lucia
laughed
as
she
confessed
an
ignorance
extending
to
the
very
name
he
noticed
that
she
always
seemed
pleased
when
she
had
any
ignorance
to
own
up
to
had
she
found
out
that
this
gave
pleasure
to
other
people
is
he
philosophy
or
is
he
religion
she
invariably
deferred
to
rickman
on
a
question
of
classification
she
handed
the
book
to
him
can
you
tell
i
really
do
know
he
seems
to
be
both
i
better
have
a
look
at
him
he
turned
over
the
pages
glancing
at
the
text
i
say
listen
to
this
he
hit
on
a
passage
at
random
and
read
out
the
greek
translating
fluently
then
the
presence
of
the
divine
fire
and
the
unspeakable
form
of
the
divine
light
descend
upon
a
man
wholly
filling
and
dominating
him
and
encompassing
him
on
every
side
so
that
he
can
in
no
way
carry
on
his
own
affairs
what
sense
or
understanding
or
perception
of
ordinary
matters
should
he
have
who
has
received
the
divine
fire
can
he
be
referring
to
the
business
capacity
of
poets
lucia
listened
amused
and
all
the
time
he
was
thinking
if
i
tell
her
now
i
shall
never
tell
her
she
sneak
off
with
miss
palliser
somewhere
in
the
afternoon
neither
noticed
that
robert
had
come
in
and
was
standing
by
with
a
telegram
robert
gazed
at
rickman
with
admiration
while
he
respectfully
waited
for
the
end
of
the
paragraph
that
he
judged
being
the
proper
moment
for
attracting
his
mistress
attention
never
in
all
his
life
would
rickman
forget
that
passage
in
the
which
he
had
not
been
thinking
about
as
lucia
took
the
telegram
she
was
still
looking
at
rickman
and
the
smile
of
amusement
was
still
on
her
face
robert
respectfully
withdrew
lucia
opened
the
envelope
and
rickman
looked
down
apparently
absorbed
in
iamblichus
he
was
now
considering
in
what
form
of
words
he
would
tell
her
then
without
looking
up
he
knew
that
something
had
happened
his
first
feeling
was
that
it
had
happened
to
himself
he
could
not
say
how
or
why
or
what
was
the
precise
moment
of
its
happening
he
only
knew
that
she
had
been
talking
to
him
listening
to
him
smiling
at
him
and
that
then
something
had
swept
him
on
one
side
and
carried
her
away
he
did
not
know
where
except
that
it
was
beyond
his
reach
he
looked
up
startled
by
a
sudden
change
in
her
breathing
she
was
standing
opposite
him
she
seemed
to
be
keeping
herself
upright
by
her
hands
pressed
palms
downwards
on
the
table
the
telegram
was
spread
open
there
before
her
and
she
was
not
looking
at
it
she
was
looking
straight
at
him
but
without
seeing
him
her
mouth
was
so
tightly
closed
that
it
might
have
been
the
pressure
of
her
lips
that
drove
the
blood
from
them
she
breathed
heavily
through
her
nostrils
her
small
thin
breast
heaving
without
a
sob
in
her
face
there
was
neither
sorrow
nor
terror
and
he
could
see
that
there
was
no
thought
in
her
brain
and
that
all
the
life
in
her
body
was
gathered
into
her
swollen
labouring
heart
and
as
he
looked
at
her
he
was
pierced
with
a
great
pang
of
pity
she
stood
there
so
supporting
herself
by
her
hands
for
about
a
minute
he
was
certain
that
no
sense
of
his
presence
reached
her
across
the
gulf
of
her
unknown
and
immeasurable
anguish
at
last
she
drew
her
hands
from
the
table
first
one
then
the
other
slowly
as
if
she
were
dragging
a
weight
her
body
swayed
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
with
an
inarticulate
murmur
and
held
out
one
arm
to
steady
her
at
his
touch
her
perishing
will
revived
and
her
faintness
passed
from
her
she
put
him
gently
aside
and
went
slowly
out
of
the
room
as
he
turned
to
the
table
the
five
words
of
her
telegram
stared
him
in
the
face
your
father
died
this
morning
it
would
have
been
horrible
if
he
had
told
her
his
first
thought
was
for
her
and
he
thanked
heaven
that
had
tied
his
tongue
then
try
as
he
would
to
realize
her
suffering
it
eluded
him
he
could
only
feel
that
a
moment
ago
she
had
been
with
him
standing
there
and
smiling
and
that
now
he
was
alone
he
could
still
feel
her
hand
pushing
against
his
outstretched
arm
there
had
been
nothing
to
wound
him
in
that
gesture
of
repulse
it
was
as
if
she
had
accepted
rather
than
refused
his
touch
as
if
her
numbed
body
took
from
it
the
impetus
it
craved
there
was
a
sound
of
hurry
and
confusion
in
the
house
servants
went
up
and
downstairs
or
stood
about
whispering
in
the
passages
he
heard
footsteps
in
that
room
above
him
which
he
knew
to
be
her
room
a
bell
rang
once
he
could
feel
the
vibration
of
the
wire
down
the
wall
of
the
library
it
was
her
bell
and
he
wondered
if
she
were
robert
rushed
in
with
a
wild
white
face
shaken
out
of
his
respectful
calm
he
was
asking
rickman
if
he
had
seen
this
month
bradshaw
they
joined
in
a
frenzied
search
for
it
she
was
not
ill
she
was
going
away
a
few
minutes
later
he
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
grating
on
the
gravel
drive
of
the
front
door
being
flung
open
of
her
voice
her
sweet
quiet
voice
then
the
grating
of
the
wheels
again
and
she
was
gone
that
of
course
ended
it
now
for
the
first
time
he
realized
what
sir
frederick
death
meant
for
himself
in
thus
snatching
her
from
him
in
the
very
crisis
of
confession
it
had
taken
away
his
chance
of
redeeming
his
dishonour
if
he
had
only
told
her
chapter
xxviii
he
did
not
go
back
to
town
on
the
seventh
after
all
he
stayed
to
finish
roughly
brutally
almost
with
the
utmost
possible
dispatch
the
disastrous
catalogue
which
would
now
be
required
whatever
happened
until
every
book
in
the
library
had
passed
through
his
hands
he
was
hardly
in
a
position
to
give
a
just
estimate
of
its
value
his
father
had
written
again
in
some
perturbation
it
seemed
that
the
old
song
for
which
he
might
obtain
the
harden
library
went
to
the
tune
of
one
thousand
pounds
but
pilkington
was
asking
one
thousand
two
hundred
it
a
large
sum
wrote
isaac
and
without
more
precise
information
than
you
given
me
yet
i
ca
tell
whether
we
should
be
justified
in
paying
it
that
confirmed
his
worst
misgivings
he
answered
it
very
precisely
indeed
we
should
be
morally
justified
in
paying
less
than
four
thousand
for
such
a
collection
and
we
should
make
a
pretty
big
profit
at
that
but
if
we
ca
afford
the
price
we
must
simply
withdraw
in
fact
i
consider
that
we
ought
to
hold
back
in
any
case
until
we
see
whether
miss
harden
or
any
of
her
people
are
going
to
come
forward
it
only
fair
to
give
them
the
chance
you
can
expect
me
on
the
twentieth
beside
writing
to
his
father
he
had
done
the
only
honest
and
straightforward
thing
that
was
left
for
him
to
do
he
had
written
to
horace
jewdwine
that
was
indeed
what
he
ought
to
have
done
at
the
very
first
he
could
see
it
now
the
simple
obvious
duty
that
had
been
staring
him
in
the
face
all
the
time
he
hardly
cared
to
think
what
subtle
but
atrocious
egoism
of
passion
had
prevented
him
from
disclosing
to
jewdwine
the
fact
of
his
presence
at
court
house
even
now
he
said
nothing
about
the
two
weeks
that
he
had
spent
working
with
jewdwine
cousin
the
catalogue
was
so
bound
up
with
the
history
of
his
passion
that
the
thing
had
become
a
catalogue
of
its
vicissitudes
some
instinct
not
wholly
selfish
told
him
that
the
least
said
about
that
the
better
he
wrote
on
the
assumption
that
jewdwine
knew
as
he
might
very
well
have
done
the
truth
about
the
harden
library
briefly
informing
him
that
they
rickman
had
been
or
rather
would
be
in
treaty
with
pilkington
for
the
purchase
but
that
he
savage
keith
rickman
considered
it
was
only
fair
to
suggest
that
jewdwine
or
some
other
member
of
sir
frederick
harden
family
should
have
the
option
of
buying
it
provided
it
could
be
so
arranged
with
pilkington
as
jewdwine
was
probably
aware
the
library
represented
security
for
one
thousand
pounds
whereas
rickman
estimated
its
market
value
at
four
or
even
five
times
as
much
but
as
pilkington
was
not
inclined
to
let
it
go
for
less
than
one
thousand
two
hundred
jewdwine
had
better
be
prepared
to
offer
a
little
more
than
that
sum
if
jewdwine
felt
inclined
to
act
on
this
suggestion
rickman
would
be
glad
if
he
would
let
him
know
within
the
next
ten
days
as
otherwise
his
father
would
be
obliged
to
close
with
pilkington
in
due
form
after
the
would
he
kindly
wire
an
acknowledgement
of
the
letter
jewdwine
had
wired
from
london
thanks
letter
received
will
write
that
was
on
the
seventeenth
and
it
was
now
the
and
jewdwine
had
not
written
rickman
should
have
been
back
in
london
long
before
that
time
he
had
allowed
himself
four
days
to
finish
his
horrible
work
and
he
had
finished
it
but
as
it
happened
the
end
of
twelve
days
found
him
still
in
harmouth
seven
of
them
passed
without
his
being
very
vividly
aware
of
them
though
up
till
now
he
had
kept
a
strict
account
of
time
two
weeks
once
struck
off
the
reckoning
he
had
come
down
to
calculating
by
days
by
hours
by
half
hours
to
measuring
minutes
as
if
they
had
been
drops
of
some
precious
liquid
slowly
evaporating
and
now
he
had
let
a
whole
week
go
by
without
comment
while
he
lay
in
bed
in
his
room
at
the
marine
hotel
doing
nothing
not
even
sleeping
for
seven
days
rickman
had
been
ill
the
broad
term
nervous
fever
was
considered
to
have
sufficiently
covered
all
his
symptoms
they
were
not
improved
by
the
discovery
that
jewdwine
had
failed
to
give
any
sign
while
the
only
reply
sent
by
rickman
was
a
brief
note
from
his
father
to
the
effect
that
keith
letter
should
have
his
very
best
consideration
and
that
by
the
time
he
saw
him
he
would
no
doubt
be
in
a
better
position
to
answer
it
there
was
a
postcard
written
on
the
inquiring
the
cause
of
his
on
the
twentieth
this
had
been
answered
by
the
doctor
it
had
been
followed
by
a
letter
of
purely
parental
solicitude
in
which
all
mention
of
business
was
avoided
avoided
and
it
was
now
the
rickman
literally
flung
from
his
a
feverish
and
illegible
note
to
horace
jewdwine
for
god
sake
wire
me
what
you
mean
to
do
an
effort
which
sent
his
temperature
up
considerably
he
passed
these
days
of
convalescence
in
an
anxious
watching
for
the
post
to
the
chambermaid
to
the
head
waiter
to
the
landlord
and
landlady
of
the
marine
hotel
to
the
friendly
commercial
gentleman
who
put
his
head
twice
a
day
round
the
door
to
inquire
he
was
gettin
on
rickman
had
during
his
seven
days
illness
put
the
same
unvarying
question
these
persons
had
adopted
a
policy
of
silence
shaking
their
heads
or
twisting
their
mouths
into
the
suggestion
of
a
no
by
way
of
escape
from
the
poignancy
of
the
situation
but
on
the
afternoon
of
the
rickman
being
for
the
first
time
up
and
dressed
tom
the
waiter
replied
to
the
accustomed
query
with
a
cheerful
no
sir
no
letters
but
a
lady
was
inquiring
for
you
this
morning
sir
in
tom
mind
a
lady
and
a
letter
amounted
to
very
much
the
same
thing
do
you
know
who
it
was
yes
sir
miss
palliser
miss
parry
i
do
know
any
miss
parry
said
rickman
wearily
i
did
say
miss
parry
sir
i
said
miss
palliser
sir
wanted
to
know
you
was
i
said
you
was
a
trifle
better
sir
i
i
all
right
i
think
i
shall
go
out
and
take
a
walk
the
violent
excitement
of
his
veins
and
nerves
gave
him
the
illusion
of
recovered
strength
his
walk
extended
from
the
hotel
door
to
a
seat
on
the
seafront
opposite
he
repeated
it
the
next
morning
with
less
difficulty
and
even
succeeded
in
reaching
a
further
seat
beyond
the
range
of
the
hotel
windows
there
he
sat
looking
at
the
sea
and
watching
without
interest
the
loiterers
on
the
esplanade
at
last
by
sheer
repetition
three
figures
forced
themselves
on
his
attention
two
ladies
one
young
the
other
and
a
clergyman
who
walked
incessantly
up
and
down
they
were
talking
as
they
passed
him
he
caught
the
organ
monotone
yes
i
shall
certainly
go
up
to
the
house
and
see
her
and
the
girl
voice
that
answered
in
a
hard
bright
trill
you
wo
see
her
she
has
seen
any
body
but
kitty
palliser
the
blood
boiled
in
his
brain
she
she
was
it
possible
that
they
were
talking
about
her
he
sat
there
debating
this
question
for
ten
minutes
when
he
was
aware
that
he
himself
had
become
an
object
of
intense
interest
to
the
three
the
two
ladies
were
in
fact
staring
rather
hard
the
stare
of
the
younger
was
so
wide
that
it
merely
included
him
as
an
unregarded
detail
in
the
panorama
of
sea
and
sky
but
the
stare
of
the
elder
a
stout
lady
in
a
florid
gown
was
concentrated
almost
passionate
it
came
straight
at
him
through
a
double
elevated
on
a
tortoiseshell
stem
the
clergyman
endeavoured
to
suggest
by
his
attitude
that
he
took
no
part
in
the
staring
or
the
talk
he
smiled
out
to
sea
with
an
air
of
beatific
union
with
nature
harmouth
beach
is
a
safe
place
for
scandal
for
even
a
organ
monotone
with
a
brilliant
feminine
flourish
on
the
top
of
it
are
lost
in
the
accompaniment
of
the
sea
so
happily
for
him
no
word
of
the
dialogue
reached
rickman
all
the
same
to
have
a
pair
of
blank
blue
eyes
and
a
tortoiseshell
binocular
levelled
at
him
in
that
fashion
is
a
little
disturbing
to
a
young
man
just
recovering
from
a
nervous
fever
and
rickman
got
up
and
dragged
himself
to
the
other
end
of
the
esplanade
out
of
the
reach
of
the
enemy
fire
therefore
he
did
not
see
that
miss
palliser
who
had
been
watching
the
scene
from
a
balcony
on
the
front
had
come
down
and
joined
the
group
neither
did
he
hear
her
cheerful
replies
to
a
volley
of
inquiries
yes
i
seen
her
nice
day
is
it
what
no
i
would
if
i
were
you
i
say
what
a
swagger
jolly
those
long
stems
are
they
you
can
stare
for
ever
without
pinching
your
nose
or
gouging
your
next
door
neighbour
eye
out
with
your
elbow
oh
yes
rather
he
a
friend
of
horace
jewdwine
do
observe
tubs
bathing
his
figure
is
not
adapted
did
you
say
a
gentleman
yes
no
yes
ask
somebody
else
it
entirely
depends
on
the
point
of
view
he
an
awfully
good
sort
tubs
ought
to
be
made
to
bathe
before
breakfast
when
there
nobody
about
yes
of
course
she
did
she
gave
him
the
work
to
please
jewdwine
i
suppose
he
been
ill
poor
little
beggar
i
must
go
and
speak
to
him
after
having
thus
first
harried
then
effectually
baffled
the
enemy
miss
palliser
started
with
a
swinging
stride
in
pursuit
of
rickman
he
sat
alone
in
an
attitude
of
extreme
dejection
on
the
stones
of
an
unfinished
and
forsaken
jetty
that
marked
the
farthest
western
limit
of
the
esplanade
having
turned
his
back
on
that
public
rendezvous
he
was
unaware
of
miss
palliser
approach
until
she
stood
beside
him
glad
to
see
you
out
again
said
she
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
raised
his
hat
at
the
first
sight
of
his
face
miss
palliser
had
a
shrewd
idea
of
the
cause
and
nature
of
his
illness
thank
you
so
much
for
your
kind
messages
i
all
right
again
as
you
see
i
see
nothing
of
the
sort
as
yet
she
had
meant
to
tell
him
that
it
was
lucia
who
had
sent
her
to
inquire
but
she
thought
better
of
it
oh
well
i
ought
to
get
round
in
this
bracing
air
harmouth
air
said
kitty
is
not
particularly
bracing
in
fact
very
relaxing
it
probably
helped
you
to
break
down
well
i
shall
be
out
of
it
soon
anyway
he
sighed
miss
palliser
can
you
tell
me
if
miss
harden
has
come
back
she
came
back
the
day
before
yesterday
have
you
seen
her
yes
i
seen
her
there
was
a
long
pause
filled
by
the
insistent
clamour
of
the
sea
his
next
question
was
less
audible
to
the
outer
than
to
the
inner
ear
how
is
she
miss
palliser
was
seldom
at
a
loss
for
a
word
but
this
time
she
hesitated
she
she
is
very
plucky
there
was
another
and
a
longer
pause
in
which
neither
had
the
courage
to
look
at
the
other
can
i
would
it
be
possible
for
me
to
see
her
miss
palliser
did
not
answer
i
would
dream
of
asking
her
except
that
i
got
something
on
my
mind
and
she
my
dear
man
she
got
everything
on
her
mind
i
know
i
i
want
to
see
her
on
business
miss
palliser
lithe
figure
grew
rigid
she
turned
on
him
a
look
of
indignation
and
contempt
everybody
wants
to
see
her
on
business
but
some
of
them
have
had
the
grace
to
wait
he
smiled
in
the
faint
tolerant
manner
of
a
man
so
steeped
in
the
bitterness
of
the
situation
that
no
comment
on
it
can
add
a
further
sting
i
ca
wait
my
business
has
much
to
do
with
me
but
it
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
miss
harden
she
looked
at
him
as
he
spoke
something
in
his
face
and
in
his
voice
too
made
her
feel
that
her
judgement
of
him
had
been
unspeakably
unpardonably
coarse
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
gently
oh
do
i
not
surprised
that
you
thought
that
of
me
i
did
think
it
i
do
quite
know
what
i
saying
i
spent
the
last
two
days
trying
to
keep
fools
from
worrying
her
i
hate
the
people
who
want
to
go
to
her
i
hate
the
people
who
keep
away
i
hate
them
all
but
i
sorry
i
spoke
like
that
to
you
you
look
horribly
i
not
ill
but
i
nearly
out
of
my
mind
about
this
business
what
is
it
tell
me
has
it
anything
to
do
with
the
library
yes
well
the
library
going
to
be
sold
i
know
that
what
i
want
to
speak
to
her
about
there
not
a
bit
of
good
in
speaking
to
her
there
are
at
this
moment
said
kitty
incisively
two
persons
in
the
house
who
call
themselves
the
men
in
possession
the
brutes
you
may
as
well
sit
down
you
ca
turn
them
out
they
two
to
one
and
their
position
is
i
believe
legally
sound
i
must
go
to
her
at
once
i
knew
this
would
happen
miss
palliser
is
any
one
with
her
i
am
with
her
i
going
back
to
her
in
a
minute
but
i
want
to
talk
to
you
first
everybody
looking
at
us
but
that
ca
be
helped
did
you
say
you
this
would
happen
yes
miss
palliser
i
in
the
most
intolerable
position
with
regard
to
miss
harden
you
knew
they
were
making
these
arrangements
oh
yes
i
knew
it
all
the
time
i
was
working
for
her
what
more
i
supposed
to
be
the
agent
for
the
sale
well
if
it
got
to
be
sold
why
not
well
you
see
my
father
only
an
ordinary
dealer
i
about
the
only
person
concerned
who
knows
the
real
value
and
i
know
that
been
undervalued
of
course
without
the
smallest
dishonesty
on
pilkington
part
mr
who
kitty
had
not
yet
heard
of
pilkington
pilkington
what
his
address
he
gave
it
her
kitty
made
a
note
of
the
name
and
address
unfortunately
pilkington
has
an
absolute
right
to
sell
it
and
my
father
has
an
absolute
right
to
buy
it
well
somebody
got
to
buy
it
i
suppose
yes
but
it
seems
to
me
we
ought
to
do
anything
till
we
know
whether
any
of
miss
harden
people
will
come
forward
she
is
the
last
of
her
people
how
about
jewdwine
he
her
cousin
on
her
mother
side
still
he
her
cousin
i
wrote
to
him
ten
days
ago
and
i
have
got
any
answer
as
yet
what
did
you
say
to
him
i
invited
him
to
step
in
and
buy
the
library
over
our
heads
and
how
much
would
he
have
had
to
pay
for
it
probably
more
than
one
thousand
two
hundred
well
if
you
think
that
jewdwine
is
the
man
to
deal
so
lightly
with
two
hundred
pounds
let
alone
the
thousand
really
that
the
quaintest
thing
you
done
yet
may
i
ask
if
this
is
the
way
you
generally
do
business
no
i
ca
say
that
it
is
well
well
you
were
very
safe
safe
i
do
want
to
be
safe
do
you
see
how
horrible
it
is
for
me
i
give
anything
if
he
or
anyone
else
would
come
in
now
and
walk
over
us
still
i
do
wonder
that
you
got
no
answer
to
your
very
remarkable
proposal
it
seemed
to
me
a
very
simple
and
obvious
proposal
i
do
know
much
about
business
said
kitty
but
i
can
think
of
a
much
more
simple
and
obvious
one
why
ca
your
people
buy
in
the
library
and
sell
it
again
for
miss
harden
on
commission
do
you
suppose
i
have
thought
of
that
it
would
be
very
simple
and
obvious
if
it
rested
with
me
but
i
afraid
my
father
might
see
it
in
the
same
light
you
see
the
thing
does
lie
between
miss
harden
and
me
but
between
my
father
and
mr
pilkington
i
do
understand
it
this
way
my
father
wo
be
buying
the
library
from
miss
harden
but
from
pilkington
and
my
father
is
a
man
of
business
and
you
most
certainly
are
not
so
he
is
likely
to
give
any
more
for
it
than
he
can
help
of
course
not
well
but
do
you
know
what
the
library
was
valued
at
kitty
did
and
she
would
have
blurted
it
out
had
not
an
inner
voice
told
her
to
be
discreet
for
once
he
took
her
silence
for
a
confession
of
ignorance
would
you
think
a
thousand
pounds
an
absurdly
high
valuation
i
do
know
kitty
tried
to
banish
all
expression
from
her
face
she
really
knew
very
little
about
business
and
was
as
yet
unaware
of
the
necessary
publicity
of
bills
of
sale
the
suspicion
crossed
her
mind
that
rickman
in
his
father
interests
might
be
trying
to
pump
her
as
to
the
smallest
sum
that
need
be
offered
because
he
added
it
is
miss
harden
stands
to
lose
something
like
three
thousand
pounds
by
it
kitty
evil
surmises
vanished
utterly
good
heavens
she
exclaimed
how
do
you
make
that
out
it
only
the
difference
between
what
the
library
ought
to
fetch
and
what
will
be
given
for
it
of
course
no
dealer
could
give
the
value
still
between
one
thousand
and
four
thousand
there
a
considerable
difference
and
who
pockets
it
my
fa
the
dealer
if
he
succeeds
in
selling
again
to
the
best
advantage
he
might
not
and
my
father
as
it
happens
considers
that
he
taking
a
great
risk
but
i
know
more
about
it
than
he
does
and
i
do
agree
with
him
that
why
i
do
want
him
to
get
hold
of
those
books
if
i
can
help
it
kitty
was
thoughtful
you
see
he
continued
i
know
he
like
to
do
what
he
thinks
generous
under
the
circumstances
but
he
is
interested
in
miss
harden
and
he
interested
in
the
harden
library
it
a
chance
that
a
dealer
like
him
only
gets
once
in
a
lifetime
and
i
afraid
it
is
in
human
nature
to
let
it
go
but
said
kitty
wildly
he
let
it
go
you
must
make
him
do
you
mean
to
say
you
going
to
sit
and
look
on
calmly
while
miss
harden
loses
three
thousand
pounds
i
not
looking
on
calmly
on
the
contrary
i
lost
my
head
what
the
good
of
losing
your
head
if
miss
harden
loses
her
money
what
do
you
propose
to
do
losing
your
head
lose
time
i
suppose
as
if
you
had
lost
enough
already
i
wrote
to
jewdwine
as
soon
as
i
heard
of
sir
frederick
death
still
you
right
i
did
lose
time
and
time
was
everything
you
ca
reproach
me
more
than
i
reproach
myself
my
dear
man
i
not
reproaching
you
i
only
want
to
know
what
going
to
do
is
there
anything
left
for
me
to
do
not
much
that
i
can
see
if
i
only
spoken
straight
out
in
the
beginning
do
you
mean
to
her
to
her
he
whispered
the
pronoun
so
softly
that
it
sounded
like
a
sigh
why
did
you
why
did
i
i
can
see
it
was
the
one
honest
thing
to
do
but
i
thought
i
no
business
to
know
about
her
father
affairs
if
she
did
and
certainly
no
business
to
talk
about
them
no
i
do
see
how
you
could
have
done
it
all
the
same
i
made
up
my
mind
to
do
it
that
morning
when
the
telegram
came
that
stopped
me
you
were
well
out
of
it
you
do
know
what
an
awful
thing
it
would
have
been
to
do
she
worshipped
her
father
is
this
what
you
been
making
yourself
ill
about
i
suppose
so
you
know
how
adorably
kind
she
was
to
me
i
can
guess
she
is
adorably
kind
to
every
one
said
kitty
gentle
but
astute
and
you
see
i
behaved
dishonourably
to
her
no
i
do
see
that
do
you
do
you
why
my
father
sent
me
partly
as
his
agent
and
all
the
time
she
believed
i
was
only
working
for
her
did
you
behave
as
your
father
agent
no
but
i
let
her
slave
from
morning
till
night
over
that
catalogue
which
she
would
have
done
in
any
case
do
you
see
that
i
ought
to
have
backed
out
of
it
altogether
in
the
very
beginning
ah
yes
if
everybody
did
what
they
ought
i
tried
twice
but
it
was
no
good
i
suppose
i
did
try
hard
enough
what
good
would
you
have
done
by
going
if
she
wanted
you
to
stay
that
how
i
argued
but
the
fact
is
i
stayed
because
i
could
go
away
of
course
it
was
an
abominable
position
but
i
assure
you
it
felt
like
heaven
when
it
did
feel
like
his
anguish
mercifully
was
too
great
for
him
to
feel
the
horror
of
his
lapse
and
kitty
hardly
noticed
it
at
any
rate
she
never
felt
the
smallest
inclination
to
smile
not
even
in
recalling
it
afterwards
it
was
if
you
came
to
think
of
it
an
unusual
a
remarkable
confession
but
she
remembered
that
he
had
had
a
nervous
fever
it
was
his
nerves
then
and
his
fever
that
had
cried
out
a
cry
covered
made
decent
almost
by
the
clangour
of
the
sea
she
wondered
how
it
came
that
when
her
mind
was
as
full
as
it
could
be
of
lucia
and
her
affairs
it
could
give
such
concentrated
attention
to
him
and
his
if
he
had
been
what
the
tortoiseshell
took
him
for
a
common
man
it
ought
to
have
been
easy
and
natural
to
dismiss
him
but
she
could
not
dismiss
him
there
was
some
force
in
him
not
consciously
exerted
which
held
her
there
on
that
conspicuous
seat
beside
him
under
the
gaze
of
the
tortoiseshell
kitty
was
by
no
means
deficient
in
what
she
had
called
profane
fancy
and
she
felt
to
her
finger
tips
that
she
was
making
a
spectacle
of
herself
at
the
end
of
the
esplanade
their
backs
at
this
moment
she
knew
must
be
standing
out
very
clear
and
bold
against
the
but
she
herself
was
losing
the
keen
sense
she
had
once
had
of
his
inappropriateness
to
the
scenes
he
moved
in
wherever
he
was
he
was
natural
he
was
she
had
it
in
one
word
sincere
as
few
people
are
sincere
nowadays
he
was
not
a
common
man
that
was
it
all
along
it
had
been
the
justification
of
their
strange
proceedings
this
fact
that
he
was
not
common
that
he
was
indeed
unique
on
that
ground
lucia
had
always
met
him
and
she
had
ignored
the
rest
kitty
was
trying
to
sympathize
with
lucia
but
he
went
on
simply
i
ca
tell
her
that
no
you
ca
tell
her
that
but
you
can
tell
her
everything
else
look
here
supposing
that
instead
of
sitting
here
tearing
your
nervous
system
to
tatters
you
go
straight
away
and
do
it
what
will
she
think
of
me
think
of
you
if
she
thinks
of
you
at
all
she
bless
you
for
having
spared
her
father
memory
up
to
the
last
possible
minute
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
my
motives
are
open
to
the
worst
construction
well
frankly
it
has
but
it
wo
occur
to
miss
harden
go
to
her
and
tell
her
everything
after
all
what
am
i
to
tell
her
oh
it
does
matter
much
what
you
tell
her
now
it
matters
a
great
deal
to
me
i
do
want
her
to
think
me
more
dishonourable
than
i
am
oh
she
wo
do
that
perhaps
she
ca
well
you
see
i
do
know
how
dishonourable
you
been
i
only
know
if
i
done
a
dishonourable
thing
if
i
done
oh
the
most
disgraceful
thing
i
can
imagine
a
thing
i
could
tell
to
anybody
else
i
would
mind
telling
lucia
harden
i
should
to
tell
her
it
would
matter
she
so
perfectly
good
that
your
own
little
amateur
efforts
in
that
line
simply
are
in
it
so
when
it
comes
to
telling
her
things
you
may
as
well
be
hung
for
a
sheep
as
a
lamb
and
wait
a
minute
you
not
likely
to
make
a
lamb
of
your
sheep
but
do
go
to
the
other
extreme
and
make
a
sheep
of
your
lamb
i
shall
not
deceive
her
you
could
she
not
only
a
good
woman
but
a
very
clever
one
though
she
does
let
you
see
it
mind
you
you
wo
find
her
clever
about
stupid
things
i
doubt
if
you
be
able
to
make
her
understand
all
this
library
affair
but
she
understand
business
they
rose
and
walked
together
forgetful
of
the
eagerly
observant
group
could
she
see
me
this
evening
i
going
yes
i
tell
her
you
coming
when
you
see
her
do
be
afraid
speak
out
i
not
afraid
of
speaking
to
her
i
afraid
of
what
simply
of
her
you
mean
you
are
afraid
of
seeing
her
changed
she
understood
him
for
it
was
what
she
herself
had
been
afraid
of
horribly
afraid
my
dear
rickman
people
in
great
trouble
do
change
to
other
people
they
only
change
to
themselves
he
raised
his
hat
and
turned
from
her
without
speaking
kitty
felt
remorseful
as
she
looked
after
him
for
she
had
not
scrupled
to
sacrifice
him
to
her
idea
kitty
idea
was
to
get
as
high
a
price
as
possible
out
of
rickman
senior
and
rickman
junior
was
the
only
man
who
could
get
it
if
the
object
was
to
shunt
rickman
senior
altogether
rickman
junior
could
be
depended
on
for
that
too
she
could
see
that
under
the
influence
of
his
unhappy
passion
he
had
absolutely
detached
himself
from
his
father
interests
and
his
own
kitty
was
profoundly
sorry
for
him
and
if
she
had
yielded
to
her
impulses
of
mercy
and
pity
she
would
have
kept
him
from
lucia
as
she
would
have
kept
a
poor
insane
moth
from
the
candle
it
might
be
necessary
to
turn
the
moth
out
of
doors
in
order
to
save
it
and
well
she
would
have
turned
him
out
of
doors
too
in
sheer
mercy
and
pity
but
kitty
had
a
practical
mind
and
that
practical
mind
perceived
the
services
that
might
be
rendered
by
a
person
so
suicidally
inspired
if
she
had
read
him
aright
fire
and
water
were
nothing
to
what
rickman
was
prepared
to
go
through
for
lucia
therefore
she
sent
him
to
lucia
but
it
was
on
his
own
account
for
his
healing
and
his
consolation
that
she
advised
him
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
chapter
xxix
lucia
was
in
the
library
and
alone
everything
was
as
she
had
left
it
that
morning
two
weeks
ago
she
saw
the
same
solid
floor
and
ceiling
the
same
faded
persian
rugs
the
same
yellow
pale
busts
on
their
tall
pedestals
the
same
bookshelves
wing
after
wing
and
row
upon
row
the
south
lattice
still
showed
through
its
leaded
lozenge
panes
the
bright
green
lawn
the
beech
tree
and
the
blue
sky
the
west
lattice
held
the
valley
and
the
hills
with
the
river
a
sinuous
band
of
silver
between
the
emerald
and
the
amethyst
these
things
were
so
woven
with
the
tissue
of
her
mind
that
the
sense
of
them
had
remained
with
her
during
the
terrible
seven
days
at
cannes
but
now
they
appeared
to
her
stripped
of
their
air
of
permanence
and
familiarity
they
were
blurred
and
insubstantial
like
things
remembered
rather
than
actually
seen
all
that
subdued
and
tender
loveliness
belonged
only
to
her
young
past
and
she
had
been
torn
from
it
so
violently
it
had
been
flung
so
far
behind
her
that
it
seemed
to
her
at
the
moment
incredible
and
impossible
life
that
had
hitherto
dealt
with
her
so
gently
and
so
graciously
had
in
the
last
two
weeks
turned
hideous
and
brutal
she
had
no
very
clear
idea
of
how
she
had
got
to
cannes
the
going
was
wiped
out
she
had
been
driven
through
the
garden
of
the
villa
des
palmes
and
had
recognized
it
as
the
garden
of
her
dream
she
had
passed
through
the
doors
of
the
villa
into
a
state
of
stupor
in
which
she
had
recognized
nothing
and
thence
into
a
sequence
of
states
which
she
could
now
too
well
recall
there
had
been
a
state
of
waking
in
which
she
had
found
herself
in
a
little
gilt
and
velvet
salon
there
was
another
woman
in
it
a
vast
woman
in
a
thin
black
dress
twinkling
all
over
with
little
black
eyes
she
had
a
great
white
powdered
face
and
they
called
her
madame
then
followed
a
state
of
hallucination
in
which
she
believed
madame
to
be
an
innocent
person
the
housekeeper
a
state
of
obsession
in
which
madame
as
she
looked
at
her
seemed
to
grow
vaster
to
become
immense
a
state
of
imbecility
in
which
her
mind
feebly
tried
to
grapple
with
the
details
of
her
father
death
as
presented
brokenly
by
madame
last
had
come
a
state
of
frenzy
in
which
she
had
freed
herself
from
madame
after
that
something
had
appeared
to
her
in
vivid
violent
illumination
so
vivid
and
so
violent
that
it
seemed
to
her
even
now
that
she
was
still
sitting
in
the
gilt
and
velvet
salon
in
the
villa
des
palmes
she
still
saw
the
thin
green
light
that
came
slanting
through
the
shutters
warm
southern
smells
floated
in
they
mixed
with
the
thick
stifling
scent
of
patchouli
and
orris
root
wafted
from
madame
as
she
went
to
and
fro
and
with
some
other
odour
bitter
and
sickly
that
came
from
the
room
beyond
she
had
made
out
certain
familiar
objects
in
this
unfamiliar
scene
her
father
travelling
rug
lay
folded
on
the
red
velvet
sofa
his
cap
and
gloves
were
there
just
as
he
had
flung
them
down
his
violin
dumb
in
its
black
case
stood
propped
up
against
the
wall
everywhere
else
only
gradually
discerned
were
things
belonging
to
madame
evidence
of
her
supreme
and
intimate
occupation
of
the
room
and
outside
was
the
garden
of
sharp
aloes
and
palms
where
as
she
believed
her
father
spirit
had
gone
looking
for
her
and
had
not
found
her
his
body
lay
in
the
inner
room
behind
the
closed
door
that
horrible
little
gilt
and
velvet
salon
whenever
she
thought
of
it
she
saw
madame
she
saw
madame
little
dry
eyes
blinking
in
her
great
white
powdered
face
she
saw
the
vast
heaving
of
madame
bust
where
the
little
jet
sequins
shivered
and
shook
she
heard
her
voice
cooing
and
purring
voluptuous
condolence
and
she
felt
again
her
own
passion
of
disgust
and
fear
as
she
wrenched
herself
free
from
the
warm
scented
body
quivering
in
its
thin
black
sheath
then
she
saw
the
inner
room
behind
the
closed
door
nothing
was
obscure
and
secret
there
the
slats
of
the
shutter
let
in
great
shafts
of
daylight
the
coffin
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
raised
on
trestles
and
covered
with
a
white
sheet
a
crucifix
stood
at
the
head
of
the
coffin
propped
against
a
chest
of
drawers
three
candles
flickering
in
their
sockets
were
set
on
the
table
at
its
foot
on
each
knob
of
the
two
hung
a
wreath
of
yellow
immortelles
that
long
coffin
raised
high
on
its
trestles
seemed
to
fill
the
little
room
lucia
saw
it
now
she
saw
the
face
in
it
turned
up
to
the
ceiling
sharp
and
yellow
the
limp
red
moustache
hanging
like
a
curtain
over
the
mouth
no
trace
of
the
tilted
smile
she
would
never
get
away
from
that
terrible
room
the
pattern
of
its
walls
garlands
of
pink
rosebuds
between
blue
stripes
was
stamped
upon
her
brain
there
too
as
in
the
salon
abode
the
inextinguishable
odour
shaken
from
madame
dress
it
mixed
with
the
hot
reek
of
carbolic
and
the
bitter
stabbing
odour
of
the
coffin
on
the
floor
by
the
trestles
lay
a
glove
a
long
enormous
glove
madame
glove
it
was
greyish
white
and
wrinkled
like
the
cast
skin
of
a
snake
the
finger
of
its
fellow
hung
from
the
chest
of
drawers
beside
the
crucifix
it
pointed
downwards
at
the
dead
man
within
the
gay
garlanded
walls
surrounded
by
those
symbols
and
souvenirs
of
madame
he
lay
with
his
face
turned
up
to
the
ceiling
and
his
mouth
half
open
as
if
it
still
gasped
piteously
for
breath
one
more
breath
to
beg
for
forgiveness
to
defend
himself
explain
while
bit
by
bit
the
place
he
had
lived
in
gave
up
his
secret
she
could
not
tell
whether
she
forgave
him
or
not
when
she
stood
by
him
there
she
could
have
implored
forgiveness
for
having
thus
come
upon
him
unawares
for
having
found
what
he
had
taken
such
pains
to
hide
from
her
it
seemed
somehow
cruel
and
unfair
she
did
not
tax
him
with
hypocrisy
because
he
had
so
long
contrived
to
keep
himself
clean
in
her
sight
she
was
grateful
to
him
for
having
spared
her
this
knowledge
but
whether
she
forgave
him
or
not
no
looking
back
on
it
at
this
moment
she
could
not
tell
lucia
was
too
young
for
the
great
forgiveness
that
comes
of
understanding
she
walked
up
and
down
the
library
staring
at
the
books
at
the
tables
piled
with
papers
she
stood
at
each
window
in
turn
and
looked
out
on
the
garden
the
valley
and
the
hills
harmouth
gap
and
the
long
brown
rampart
line
of
muttersmoor
it
was
simply
impossible
for
her
to
realize
their
once
intimate
relation
to
her
life
she
was
unaware
that
her
mood
was
chiefly
the
result
of
physical
and
mental
exhaustion
it
seemed
to
her
rather
that
she
had
acquired
strange
powers
of
insight
that
she
had
pierced
to
the
back
of
the
illusion
never
had
she
possessed
so
luminous
a
sense
of
the
unreality
of
things
she
found
this
view
consoling
for
it
is
the
desire
of
unhappy
youth
that
there
shall
be
no
permanence
where
there
is
pain
on
this
unreal
and
insubstantial
background
faces
came
and
went
all
day
long
faces
solemn
and
obsequious
faces
glazed
and
feverish
with
emotion
robert
face
with
eyes
hiding
unutterable
sympathy
under
a
thin
mask
of
fright
kitty
face
with
an
entirely
new
expression
on
it
and
her
own
face
met
them
with
an
incomprehensible
and
tearless
calm
for
she
was
not
even
sure
of
that
not
even
sure
of
her
own
sorrow
she
had
had
to
do
with
sorrow
once
before
when
her
grandfather
died
and
she
thought
she
would
be
sure
to
know
it
when
it
came
to
her
again
but
she
had
no
name
for
this
new
feeling
and
at
times
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
not
sorrow
at
all
whatever
it
was
she
had
determined
to
bear
it
as
far
as
possible
alone
she
was
almost
sorry
that
she
had
not
refused
kitty
offer
to
stay
with
her
she
suffered
so
from
kitty
inability
to
conceal
the
truth
not
that
kitty
said
anything
it
was
her
unnatural
silence
that
was
so
terrible
with
that
extraordinary
acuteness
that
had
come
upon
her
now
lucia
saw
in
the
involuntary
hardening
and
flushing
of
kitty
face
that
in
kitty
mind
her
father
was
not
only
suspected
but
condemned
she
was
afraid
lest
she
herself
should
in
some
moments
of
weakness
betray
him
and
kitty
strange
unusual
tenderness
inspired
her
with
terror
she
shrank
even
from
old
palliser
kitty
mother
with
her
soft
trembling
face
and
clinging
hands
their
sympathy
was
poignant
and
unnerving
and
she
needed
all
her
strength
for
the
things
she
had
to
do
she
did
them
too
while
one
half
of
her
brain
had
slackened
its
grip
of
the
world
the
other
half
retained
the
most
perfect
grasp
of
certain
necessary
details
she
spent
the
morning
with
her
solicitor
while
he
explained
to
her
the
first
principles
of
finance
and
the
inner
meaning
of
mortgages
and
bills
of
sale
she
understood
clearly
that
the
things
which
would
naturally
have
come
to
her
on
her
father
death
belonged
in
a
certain
sense
to
richard
pilkington
of
shaftesbury
avenue
schofield
poor
man
had
approached
this
branch
of
his
subject
gently
and
gingerly
with
every
delicacy
of
phrasing
that
his
fancy
could
suggest
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
her
through
eyes
respectfully
veiling
the
shrewdness
of
his
gaze
lucia
had
at
first
displayed
so
little
interest
and
intelligence
that
he
felt
himself
compelled
to
a
broader
and
simpler
statement
of
the
facts
with
the
exception
of
her
own
personal
possessions
nothing
in
court
house
remained
to
her
nothing
not
a
book
not
a
solitary
piece
of
furniture
pilkington
bill
of
sale
was
he
grieved
to
say
inclusive
of
everything
from
the
harden
library
and
the
great
gallery
of
portraits
to
the
glass
and
china
in
the
pantry
and
the
blankets
on
the
beds
not
even
he
had
said
that
little
paper
weight
that
you
have
in
your
hand
miss
harden
and
lucia
had
examined
the
paper
weight
as
if
she
saw
it
for
the
first
time
she
put
it
down
and
smiled
it
struck
her
as
incomprehensible
ludicrous
almost
that
any
one
could
spend
so
much
passion
and
solemnity
on
things
so
unimportant
so
irrelevant
she
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
to
hear
that
they
did
not
belong
to
her
the
inconceivable
thing
was
that
they
ever
had
belonged
to
her
and
as
the
solicitor
looked
at
her
the
corners
of
his
mouth
twitched
with
a
little
spasm
of
pity
his
eyes
lost
their
veiled
shrewdness
and
when
she
smiled
they
stared
in
frankest
fright
for
a
moment
he
supposed
that
the
shock
of
his
announcement
had
turned
her
brain
it
never
occurred
to
that
astute
intelligence
that
she
was
smiling
at
his
own
simplicity
when
he
had
left
she
returned
to
the
she
sorted
and
arranged
a
disordered
heap
of
business
letters
letters
of
condolence
and
tradesmen
bills
she
pushed
aside
the
letters
of
condolence
kitty
would
answer
those
she
unlocked
a
drawer
and
took
from
it
two
open
envelopes
scored
with
many
postmarks
and
addressed
to
harmouth
to
cannes
and
to
harmouth
again
these
she
scrutinized
anxiously
as
if
they
disclosed
some
secret
guarded
by
their
contents
then
she
read
the
letters
carefully
all
over
again
one
was
from
her
cousin
edith
jewdwine
edith
sympathy
covered
two
sheets
it
flowed
from
her
pen
facile
and
fluent
edith
had
had
the
influenza
otherwise
edith
would
have
come
to
lucia
at
once
could
not
lucia
come
to
her
instead
edith
could
not
bear
to
think
of
lucia
alone
there
in
her
trouble
in
that
great
big
house
she
was
glad
that
kitty
palliser
was
with
her
if
only
she
had
not
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
catch
influenza
and
so
on
lucia
was
sorry
that
edith
had
influenza
but
she
was
not
sorry
that
she
had
not
come
she
did
not
want
edith
with
her
the
other
letter
was
from
horace
horace
had
refined
his
expressions
of
condolence
into
one
faultless
phrase
the
rest
of
his
letter
consisted
of
apologies
and
offers
of
service
these
his
close
cramped
handwriting
confined
to
the
centre
of
the
sheet
leaving
a
broad
and
decent
margin
to
suggest
the
inexpressible
he
had
heard
of
his
uncle
death
indirectly
why
had
she
not
sent
for
him
if
she
had
wired
to
him
at
once
he
could
have
made
arrangements
to
meet
and
take
her
to
cannes
or
he
could
have
joined
her
there
and
brought
her
home
at
present
he
was
overwhelmed
with
business
but
he
hoped
to
run
down
to
harmouth
at
the
end
of
the
week
and
travel
up
to
town
with
her
he
understood
that
she
was
going
to

with
edith
busy
as
he
was
he
would
come
now
at
any
minute
if
he
could
be
of
any
immediate
use
she
had
only
to
wire
if
she
wanted
him
she
laid
down
that
letter
pushed
it
aside
took
it
up
again
and
read
it
a
second
time
as
if
to
satisfy
herself
as
to
the
meaning
she
was
not
sure
as
to
what
horace
was
or
was
not
willing
to
do
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
he
was
deeply
sorry
for
her
why
had
she
not
sent
for
him
why
indeed
her
first
instinct
had
been
to
send
for
him
she
had
only
to
let
him
know
that
she
was
in
trouble
and
he
would
have
come
to
her
at
any
inconvenience
to
himself
and
that
of
course
was
why
she
had
not
sent
it
would
have
been
so
impossible
for
him
to
refuse
and
now
she
was
thankful
that
she
had
spared
him
and
that
he
had
not
followed
her
to
those
terrible
rooms
in
the
villa
des
palmes
that
he
knew
nothing
of
those
seven
days
she
would
have
endured
any
suffering
paid
any
price
to
obliterate
the
memory
of
them
it
was
horrible
to
think
how
nearly
horace
had
been
there
horace
of
all
people
the
fastidious
the
immaculate
the
merciless
if
she
had
found
it
hard
to
judge
her
dead
father
tenderly
she
knew
what
horace
judgement
would
have
been
she
had
only
to
wire
if
she
wanted
him
oh
no
he
was
the
last
person
that
she
wanted
now
those
two
letters
she
answered
without
more
delay
to
horace
she
wrote
in
a
reassuring
manner
so
as
to
absolve
him
from
any
sense
of
obligation
he
might
happen
to
feel
she
would
rather
he
came
down
a
little
later
than
he
proposed
meanwhile
he
was
not
to
be
anxious
for
schofield
was
managing
her
affairs
extremely
well
she
admitted
that
when
those
wonderful
affairs
were
settled
her
income
would
be
but
small
she
considered
that
this
was
a
thing
horace
ought
to
be
told
before
before
he
wrote
any
more
letters
she
added
that
the
library
the
pictures
and
the
furniture
would
have
to
be
sold
and
court
house
too
she
was
afraid
that
also
was
a
fact
that
must
not
be
concealed
from
him
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
concern
horace
so
much
more
than
it
did
her
these
things
which
it
was
her
duty
to
tell
him
she
told
simply
and
plainly
but
she
omitted
to
mention
that
two
men
in
possession
were
sitting
in
the
housekeeper
room
in
attitudes
of
more
or
less
constraint
she
ended
by
assuring
horace
of
her
gratitude
with
a
fervency
which
suggested
that
he
had
some
cause
to
doubt
it
and
indeed
at
the
moment
she
could
hardly
tell
whether
she
were
more
grateful
to
him
for
offering
to
come
to
her
or
for
having
stopped
away
all
this
necessary
business
lucia
transacted
with
one
half
of
her
mind
while
the
other
stood
far
off
possessed
by
its
sense
of
unreality
of
illusion
next
she
went
through
the
tradesmen
bills
there
were
a
great
many
people
to
be
paid
and
unless
court
house
were
sold
there
would
be
nothing
to
pay
them
with
it
was
at
this
point
that
robert
came
in
with
the
announcement
that
rickman
had
called
and
wished
to
see
her
at
first
the
active
intelligence
being
busy
with
accounts
her
only
idea
was
that
she
owed
rickman
fifteen
pounds
and
that
when
all
debts
were
paid
fifteen
pounds
would
represent
a
very
solid
portion
of
her
income
then
her
dreaming
self
awoke
to
the
memory
of
something
unachieved
an
obligation
rashly
incurred
a
promise
that
could
never
be
fulfilled
yes
she
would
see
rickman
chapter

lucia
had
risen
and
was
standing
in
the
embrasure
of
the
south
window
she
had
her
back
to
the
door
so
that
she
could
not
see
him
as
he
came
in
he
wondered
how
on
earth
he
was
going
to
get
over
the
space
between
the
window
and
the
door
a
sudden
wave
of
weakness
went
through
his
body
he
had
horrible
sensations
of
sinking
at
the
middle
and
of
giving
way
altogether
at
the
knees
he
had
been
afraid
of
seeing
her
suffer
now
he
knew
that
what
he
was
really
afraid
of
was
her
fear
of
seeing
him
he
expected
to
see
her
face
set
in
abhorrence
of
his
sympathy
her
body
shrink
in
anticipation
of
a
touch
on
her
pain
lucia
spared
him
all
the
embarrassments
of
that
approach
as
if
she
had
divined
his
feeling
she
turned
she
came
forward
to
meet
him
she
held
out
her
hand
and
smiled
as
she
would
have
smiled
if
nothing
had
happened
his
hand
trembled
visibly
as
it
dropped
from
hers
he
hid
it
in
his
breast
pocket
where
it
pretended
to
be
looking
for
things
miss
palliser
said
she
thought
you
would
see
me
yes
i
wanted
to
see
you
i
would
have
sent
for
you
if
you
had
not
come
sit
down
please
she
sat
down
herself
in
her
old
place
at
the
writing
table
he
took
the
chair
beside
her
and
leaned
back
resting
his
arm
on
the
table
she
turned
so
as
to
face
him
she
was
not
so
changed
but
that
his
hungry
and
unhappy
eyes
could
rest
on
her
appeased
and
comforted
and
yet
she
changed
too
her
girlhood
with
all
its
innocence
of
suffering
had
died
in
her
but
the
touch
of
that
death
was
masterly
it
had
redeemed
her
beauty
from
the
vagueness
of
its
youth
grief
that
drags
or
sharpens
or
deforms
the
faces
of
older
women
had
given
to
hers
the
precision
that
it
lacked
there
was
a
faint
sallow
tinge
in
the
whiteness
of
her
skin
and
her
eyelids
drooped
as
if
she
were
tired
to
the
point
of
exhaustion
he
noticed
too
the
pathetic
tension
that
restrained
the
quivering
of
her
mouth
it
was
the
upper
lip
that
trembled
you
have
been
ill
she
said
and
as
he
answered
that
oh
it
was
nothing
he
was
aware
for
the
first
time
how
very
much
it
had
been
she
too
was
aware
of
it
she
expressed
her
concern
she
hoped
that
they
had
looked
after
him
well
at
the
hotel
decidedly
she
had
grown
older
and
her
manner
had
grown
older
too
it
suggested
that
it
was
she
who
was
the
protector
that
she
wished
as
far
as
possible
to
spare
him
in
an
interview
which
must
necessarily
be
painful
it
was
as
if
she
remembered
that
he
at
any
rate
was
young
and
that
these
gloomy
circumstances
must
be
highly
distasteful
to
his
youth
in
that
she
was
the
same
as
ever
every
nerve
in
her
shrank
from
the
pain
of
giving
pain
at
least
that
was
his
first
impression
and
then
no
consoling
view
being
really
open
to
him
he
told
himself
he
was
a
fool
to
suppose
that
in
the
circumstances
she
could
think
of
him
at
all
he
had
nothing
tangible
to
go
upon
he
could
see
through
it
he
could
see
perfectly
through
the
smile
the
even
the
air
of
polite
and
leisurely
interest
in
his
illness
she
dwelt
on
him
because
he
was
of
all
themes
the
one
most
indifferent
to
her
she
was
simply
holding
herself
in
according
to
the
indestructible
instincts
of
her
race
he
need
not
have
been
afraid
of
seeing
her
suffer
that
at
any
rate
he
would
not
see
to
let
him
see
it
would
have
been
to
her
an
extreme
personal
degradation
an
offence
against
the
decencies
of
her
class
this
sorrow
of
hers
this
invisible
yet
implacable
sorrow
stood
between
them
waving
him
away
it
opened
up
again
the
impassable
gulf
he
felt
himself
not
only
a
stranger
but
an
inferior
separated
from
her
beyond
all
possibility
of
approach
she
had
not
changed
she
had
simply
reverted
to
her
type
her
eyes
waited
for
him
to
speak
but
they
were
not
the
eyes
he
knew
the
eyes
that
had
drawn
him
to
confession
it
was
borne
in
upon
him
that
this
though
it
might
be
his
last
moment
with
her
was
not
the
moment
to
confess
there
was
a
positive
grossness
in
the
idea
of
unburdening
himself
in
the
presence
of
this
incommunicable
grief
it
was
like
putting
in
a
claim
for
consideration
as
an
equal
sufferer
he
had
no
right
to
obtrude
himself
upon
her
at
all
in
her
attention
there
was
a
hint
a
very
delicate
and
gentle
one
that
he
would
do
well
to
be
impersonal
and
above
all
brief
it
was
about
the
library
that
i
wanted
to
see
you
miss
harden
was
it
i
was
just
going
to
ask
you
not
to
do
anything
more
to
the
catalogue
if
you
have
not
finished
it
i
finished
it
ten
days
ago
before
the
she
smiled
faintly
then
you
kept
your
promise
it
does
matter
what
i
most
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
was
the
secretaryship
i
offered
you
i
afraid
we
must
give
it
up
oh
miss
harden
his
tone
expressed
that
he
had
always
given
it
up
that
it
was
not
to
be
thought
of
for
an
instant
but
evidently
she
was
possessed
with
the
idea
that
he
had
a
claim
upon
her
i
very
sorry
but
as
things
have
turned
out
i
sha
be
able
to
keep
a
secretary
in
fact
as
you
may
have
heard
i
not
able
to
keep
anything
hardly
not
even
my
promises
please
please
do
think
of
it
there
is
no
use
thinking
of
it
still
i
wanted
you
to
know
that
i
really
meant
it
i
believed
it
could
be
done
of
course
i
do
know
how
much
you
really
wanted
it
wanted
it
i
given
half
my
life
for
a
year
of
it
lucia
hand
laid
lightly
on
the
table
edge
felt
a
strong
vibration
communicated
to
it
from
rickman
arm
she
looked
up
in
time
to
see
his
white
face
quiver
before
he
hid
it
with
his
hand
i
so
sorry
did
it
mean
so
much
to
you
he
smiled
through
his
agony
at
the
cause
assigned
to
it
i
not
thinking
of
that
what
it
means
to
me
what
it
always
will
mean
is
your
goodness
in
thinking
of
it
in
thinking
of
it
now
it
was
his
nearest
approach
to
a
sympathetic
allusion
she
did
not
wince
perceptibly
but
she
ignored
the
allusion
oh
that
nothing
you
would
have
been
of
great
use
to
me
if
i
thought
of
helping
you
at
all
my
idea
was
simply
how
shall
i
put
it
to
make
up
in
some
way
for
the
harm
i
done
you
what
harm
have
you
ever
done
me
for
one
moment
he
thought
that
she
had
discovered
his
preposterous
passion
and
reproached
herself
for
being
a
cause
of
pain
but
she
explained
i
ought
to
say
the
harm
the
catalogue
did
you
i
afraid
it
was
responsible
for
your
illness
he
protested
but
she
stuck
to
it
and
after
all
i
might
just
as
well
have
let
you
go
for
the
library
will
have
to
be
sold
but
i
did
not
know
that
i
knew
it
though
you
knew
it
how
did
you
know
it
i
know
pilkington
who
knows
my
father
he
practically
gave
him
the
refusal
of
the
library
which
is
exactly
what
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
he
explained
the
situation
to
her
as
he
had
explained
it
to
miss
palliser
only
at
greater
length
and
with
considerably
greater
difficulty
for
lucia
did
not
take
it
up
as
miss
palliser
had
done
point
by
point
she
laid
it
down
rather
dismissed
it
with
a
statement
of
her
trust
in
the
integrity
of
rickman
if
she
said
the
library
must
be
sold
i
very
glad
that
your
father
who
is
going
to
buy
it
he
tried
to
make
her
see
without
too
deeply
incriminating
his
father
that
this
was
not
the
destiny
most
to
be
desired
for
it
it
was
in
approaching
this
part
of
his
subject
that
he
most
diverged
from
his
manner
of
treating
it
before
miss
palliser
miss
palliser
had
appreciated
the
commercial
point
of
view
her
practical
mind
accepted
the
assumption
that
a
dealer
was
but
human
and
that
abnegation
on
his
part
in
such
a
matter
would
amount
to
nothing
less
than
a
moral
miracle
but
miss
harden
would
have
a
higher
conception
of
human
obligation
than
miss
palliser
at
any
rate
he
could
hardly
expect
her
sense
of
honour
to
be
less
delicate
than
his
own
and
if
considered
that
his
father
was
morally
bound
to
withdraw
from
the
business
she
could
only
think
one
thing
of
his
remaining
in
it
therefore
to
suggest
to
miss
harden
that
his
father
might
insist
upon
remaining
constituted
a
far
more
terrible
exposure
of
that
person
than
anything
he
had
said
to
miss
palliser
why
should
he
buy
it
she
asked
because
i
afraid
selling
it
in
in
that
way
you
wo
make
much
money
over
it
well
it
not
a
question
of
making
money
it
a
question
of
paying
a
debt
how
much
you
make
or
lose
of
course
depends
on
the
amount
of
the
debt
what
it
was
valued
at
lucia
unlike
kitty
was
neither
suspicious
nor
discreet
she
had
the
required
fact
at
her
fingers
ends
and
instantly
produced
it
it
was
valued
at
exactly
one
thousand
pounds
and
it
should
have
been
valued
at
four
my
father
ca
give
anything
like
that
we
ought
to
be
able
to
find
somebody
who
can
but
it
might
take
a
considerable
time
and
there
is
no
time
what
do
you
advise
me
to
do
then
well
if
we
could
persuade
pilkington
to
sell
by
auction
that
would
be
all
right
if
we
ca
i
advise
you
to
buy
it
back
or
a
part
of
it
yourself
buy
back
the
books
that
make
it
valuable
got
the
aldine
plato
and
the
neapolitan
horace
and
the
printed
by
wynken
de
worde
he
positively
blushed
as
he
consummated
this
final
act
of
treachery
to
rickman
and
heaps
of
others
equally
valuable
i
can
give
you
a
list
of
fifty
or
so
you
can
buy
them
for
a
pound
and
sell
the
lot
for
three
thousand
if
pilkington
collars
the
rest
he
still
be
paid
and
there
may
be
something
over
she
considered
a
moment
has
pilkington
any
idea
of
the
value
of
those
books
i
certain
he
has
only
an
expert
could
have
would
it
be
perfectly
fair
to
him
to
perfectly
fair
you
buy
them
at
his
own
valuation
i
see
i
should
like
to
do
that
if
if
it
can
be
managed
i
think
it
can
be
managed
my
father
is
likely
to
settle
with
pilkington
without
consulting
me
if
he
settled
we
must
try
and
get
him
to
withdraw
oh
surely
there
would
be
no
difficulty
about
that
he
said
nothing
it
was
really
terrible
the
way
she
took
integrity
for
granted
to
be
sure
his
father
had
a
reputation
with
the
family
he
remembered
how
sir
joseph
used
to
praise
him
to
his
face
as
the
only
honest
dealer
in
london
but
sir
joseph
was
in
the
habit
of
buying
books
not
selling
them
he
rose
and
turned
away
evading
her
innocent
eyes
i
hope
not
i
see
pilkington
about
it
by
the
way
here
pilkington
did
you
expect
him
no
i
her
voice
died
away
extinguished
in
her
horror
chapter
xxxi
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
it
pilkington
was
coming
by
the
private
way
stepping
softly
over
a
fair
green
lawn
the
low
golden
light
before
sunset
flooded
the
lawn
so
that
pilkington
walking
in
it
was
strangely
and
gloriously
illuminated
everything
about
him
shone
from
his
high
silk
hat
to
the
tips
of
his
varnished
boots
his
frock
coat
and
trousers
of
grey
summer
suiting
clung
to
his
figure
like
a
warm
and
sunny
skin
all
over
pilkington
and
round
about
him
there
hung
the
atmosphere
of
the
city
not
of
the
actual
murky
labyrinth
roofed
with
fog
but
of
the
city
as
she
stands
transfigured
before
the
eyes
of
the
young
speculator
in
her
orient
golden
mood
lucia
had
seen
him
the
light
died
out
of
her
face
her
lips
straightened
she
stood
motionless
superb
intent
with
such
a
look
and
in
such
an
attitude
a
roman
maiden
might
have
listened
to
the
feet
of
the
vandal
at
the
gate
he
was
coming
very
swiftly
was
dicky
as
if
borne
by
an
impetus
of
conquest
as
he
caught
sight
of
miss
harden
through
the
open
window
though
he
kept
his
head
rigidly
averted
his
eyes
slewed
round
towards
her
and
at
the
same
moment
his
fingers
rose
instinctively
to
his
little
fair
moustache
it
was
the
gesture
of
the
irresistible
male
i
see
him
she
asked
helplessly
she
had
realized
everything
in
that
moment
not
unless
you
like
shall
i
deal
with
him
if
you
would
be
so
good
but
no
it
does
matter
i
shall
have
to
see
him
later
she
sat
down
again
and
waited
the
silence
was
so
tense
that
it
seemed
to
bear
the
impact
of
her
pulses
it
throbbed
and
quivered
with
pain
outside
the
sound
of
the
pebbles
crunched
under
footsteps
became
a
concert
of
shrieks
rickman
did
not
offer
to
go
as
pilkington
advanced
for
heaven
knew
how
in
some
obscure
and
subtle
way
she
had
managed
to
convey
to
him
that
his
presence
was
a
protection
pilkington
entered
the
room
with
the
air
of
a
man
completely
assured
as
to
his
reception
he
bowed
to
miss
harden
an
extraordinary
bow
no
words
could
have
conveyed
the
exquisite
intimations
of
pilkington
spine
it
was
as
if
he
had
said
to
her
madam
you
need
be
afraid
in
your
presence
i
am
all
deference
and
chivalry
and
restraint
but
no
sooner
had
dicky
achieved
this
admirable
effect
of
refinement
than
he
spoilt
it
all
by
the
glance
he
levelled
at
young
rickman
expressed
nothing
but
the
crude
emotion
of
the
insolent
male
baulked
of
his
desire
to
find
himself
alone
on
the
field
it
insulted
her
as
brutally
as
any
words
by
its
unblushing
assumption
of
the
attitude
of
sex
i
must
introduce
myself
miss
he
said
ignoring
rickman
i
think
i
have
had
the
pleasure
his
large
mouth
closed
reluctantly
on
the
unfinished
phrase
he
seated
himself
with
circumstance
parting
the
tails
of
his
coat
very
carefully
he
had
chosen
a
seat
opposite
the
window
as
if
conscious
of
the
glory
of
his
appearance
he
offered
himself
liberally
to
the
light
he
let
it
play
over
his
figure
a
figure
that
youth
subdued
to
sleekness
that
would
one
day
be
corpulence
it
drew
out
all
the
yellow
in
his
moustache
and
hair
it
blazed
in
his
thence
it
alighted
a
pale
watery
splendour
on
the
bridge
of
his
nose
it
was
a
bridge
where
two
nationalities
met
and
contended
for
mastery
pilkington
nose
had
started
with
a
distinctly
semitic
intention
frustrated
by
the
in
him
its
downward
course
being
docked
to
the
proportion
of
a
snub
nobody
knew
better
than
pilkington
that
it
was
that
snub
that
saved
him
he
was
proud
of
it
as
a
proof
of
his
descent
from
the
dominant
race
assisted
by
his
reluctantly
closing
mouth
and
double
it
inspired
confidence
giving
to
pilkington
face
an
expression
of
extreme
openness
and
candour
he
was
proud
of
his
too
he
considered
that
it
made
him
look
like
a
man
of
science
or
of
letters
but
it
did
it
did
much
better
for
him
than
that
it
took
all
the
subtlety
out
of
his
face
and
endowed
it
with
an
earnest
and
enormous
stare
and
as
that
large
mouth
could
and
would
close
properly
his
sentences
had
a
way
of
dying
off
in
a
faint
gasp
leaving
a
great
deal
to
the
imagination
all
these
natural
characteristics
were
invaluable
for
business
purposes
but
if
you
had
asked
pilkington
for
the
secret
of
his
success
he
would
have
told
you
that
he
owed
it
to
his
possession
of
two
qualities
bounce
and
tact
to
both
mind
you
for
tact
without
bounce
will
carry
a
man
neither
far
nor
high
while
bounce
without
tact
will
elevate
him
occasionally
to
his
own
perdition
conversationally
he
was
furnished
with
tentacles
sensitive
to
the
lightest
touch
of
an
idea
he
had
the
very
subtlest
discernment
of
shades
within
shades
he
grasped
with
airy
impact
he
moved
by
a
delicate
contact
and
recoil
a
process
he
was
pleased
to
describe
as
feelin
his
way
he
did
not
rush
brutally
into
business
as
a
man
of
coarser
fibre
might
have
done
he
removed
his
gloves
adjusted
his
and
admired
the
view
he
shrank
from
the
suggestion
that
he
had
come
to
take
possession
but
clearly
he
could
not
take
possession
of
the
view
it
was
a
safe
and
soothing
topic
you
have
a
very
glorious
outlook
here
miss
harden
then
pilkington
perceived
a
shade
miss
harden
outlook
was
glorious
by
an
almost
visible
recoil
from
his
own
blunder
he
strove
to
convey
an
impression
of
excessive
delicacy
wot
very
exceptional
weather
we
are
enjoying
perceiving
another
and
a
finer
shade
for
evidently
miss
harden
was
not
enjoying
the
weather
or
indeed
anything
else
pilkington
again
shifted
his
ground
he
spoke
of
books
he
noticed
with
approval
the
arrangement
of
the
library
he
admired
the
harden
taste
in
costly
bindings
as
if
he
were
by
no
means
personally
concerned
with
any
of
these
things
and
thus
by
a
delicate
and
imperceptible
transition
he
slid
into
his
theme
now
as
regards
this
this
sale
miss
harden
i
hope
you
understand
i
understand
that
you
are
my
father
chief
creditor
and
that
the
sale
is
necessary
quite
so
but
i
most
awfully
sorry
for
the
necessity
as
for
time
i
do
want
you
to
feel
that
you
pressed
or
hurried
in
any
way
pilkington
eyes
gazed
up
at
her
under
their
great
glasses
humid
and
immense
his
lower
lip
drooped
in
an
uncertain
manner
he
had
a
great
deal
of
nice
feeling
about
him
had
dicky
i
hope
those
men
are
making
a
nuisance
of
themselves
they
had
strict
orders
to
keep
in
the
background
i
upset
said
pilkington
in
a
thick
emotional
voice
about
this
affair
and
i
want
to
consider
you
miss
harden
in
every
possible
way
you
are
very
kind
but
i
would
rather
you
did
consider
me
in
any
way
at
all
as
she
said
this
rickman
looked
at
her
with
a
grave
smile
conveying
behind
pilkington
back
an
unmistakable
warning
pilkington
smiled
too
a
large
and
fluttering
smile
as
of
one
indulgent
to
any
little
attempt
at
brilliance
on
the
part
of
a
young
lady
under
a
cloud
lucia
swept
him
and
his
smile
with
her
long
and
steady
gaze
a
gaze
which
made
dicky
exceedingly
uncomfortable
i
think
if
you
have
any
arrangements
to
make
you
had
better
see
my
solicitor
i
have
an
appointment
said
dicky
not
without
a
certain
dignity
with
schofield
morning
then
i
suppose
what
you
want
now
is
to
look
over
the
house
the
question
and
the
gaze
were
so
direct
that
dicky
who
had
meant
to
amble
delicately
round
that
point
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
lost
his
head
dropped
his
and
fairly
let
himself
go
well
perhaps
as
i
here
i
better
a
look
round
of
course
if
if
it
in
any
way
inconvenient
not
in
the
least
you
can
look
round
at
once
she
rang
the
bell
on
her
way
to
it
she
gathered
up
some
books
that
were
lying
out
of
sight
and
laid
them
on
the
table
these
she
said
to
rickman
belong
to
the
library
they
must
go
with
the
rest
he
looked
at
them
one
was
an
aldine
dante
he
had
seen
her
reading
it
he
took
pilkington
aside
and
said
something
to
him
in
a
tone
which
lucia
could
not
hear
her
hand
was
on
the
door
when
pilkington
sprang
forward
one
moment
miss
harden
everything
must
be
sold
in
the
regular
way
but
if
you
tell
me
of
any
books
you
a
special
fancy
for
make
a
note
of
them
and
buy
them
in
for
you
he
paused
awaiting
the
breath
of
inspiration
it
came
for
for
a
merely
nominal
sum
to
do
dicky
justice
this
delicate
idea
greatly
commended
itself
to
his
good
nature
business
is
business
but
not
willingly
did
dicky
inflict
pain
least
of
all
upon
a
young
and
pretty
woman
besides
he
had
an
eye
to
his
reputation
he
was
disposed
to
do
this
thing
handsomely
rickman
envied
him
his
inspiration
his
merely
nominal
sum
thank
you
the
books
were
not
mine
said
lucia
in
spite
of
another
meaning
look
from
her
ally
quite
so
but
i
should
disregard
that
if
i
were
you
anyhow
you
can
think
it
over
and
if
you
change
your
mind
you
can
let
me
or
mr
rickman
know
before
the
sale
lucia
looked
down
at
him
from
her
height
i
shall
not
change
my
mind
if
i
want
to
keep
any
of
the
books
i
can
buy
them
from
mr
rickman
she
turned
to
rickman
in
the
doorway
all
the
same
it
was
kind
of
you
to
think
of
it
she
said
it
very
distinctly
so
that
pilkington
could
hear
rickman
followed
her
out
of
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
them
she
turned
on
him
eyes
positively
luminous
with
trust
it
was
as
if
she
had
abandoned
the
leading
of
her
intellect
and
flung
the
reins
on
the
neck
of
her
intuition
i
was
right
was
i
i
would
so
much
rather
buy
them
back
from
you
from
my
father
it
the
same
thing
is
it
he
smiled
sadly
i
afraid
it
is
quite
why
did
you
accept
his
offer
i
could
she
shuddered
slightly
her
face
expressed
her
deep
and
desperate
repugnance
i
buy
them
back
from
you
he
is
really
arranging
with
your
father
is
he
yes
it
was
the
third
time
that
she
had
appealed
from
pilkington
to
him
and
there
was
a
profound
humiliation
in
the
thought
that
at
this
precise
moment
the
loathsome
dicky
might
be
of
more
solid
use
to
her
than
he
well
then
she
said
almost
triumphantly
i
shall
be
safe
you
will
do
your
best
for
me
it
was
a
statement
but
he
met
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
question
i
will
indeed
he
saw
that
it
was
in
identifying
his
father
with
him
that
she
left
it
to
their
honour
chapter
xxxii
dicky
pilkington
did
not
belong
to
the
aristocracy
of
finance
indeed
finance
had
not
in
any
form
claimed
him
at
the
first
under
the
grey
and
gleaming
hidden
away
behind
the
unapparent
splendours
of
dicky
pilkington
attire
his
undermost
garments
were
of
woven
silk
in
a
corner
of
his
young
barbarian
heart
there
lurked
an
obscure
veneration
for
culture
and
for
art
when
his
day
work
was
done
the
time
that
dicky
did
not
spend
in
the
promenade
of
the
jubilee
variety
theatre
he
spent
in
reading
karl
pearson
and
robert
louis
stevenson
with
his
feet
on
the
fender
he
knew
the
greek
characters
he
he
could
tell
plato
from
aristotle
by
the
look
of
the
text
dicky
had
begun
life
as
a
junior
journalist
but
before
that
long
long
before
when
he
was
an
innocent
schoolboy
dicky
had
a
pair
of
wings
dear
little
cherubic
wings
that
fluttered
uneasily
under
his
little
jacket
the
wings
moulted
as
dicky
grew
older
they
shrank
in
the
course
of
his
evolution
to
mere
rudimentary
appendages
and
poor
dicky
flopped
instead
of
flying
finally
they
dropped
off
and
dicky
was
much
happier
without
them
rickman
used
to
say
that
if
you
stripped
him
you
saw
the
marks
of
them
still
quite
plainly
and
dicky
was
always
stripping
himself
and
showing
them
they
proved
to
these
writing
fellows
what
he
might
have
been
if
he
had
only
chosen
he
had
begun
by
being
a
poet
like
the
best
of
them
and
in
his
heart
of
hearts
dicky
believed
that
it
was
as
a
poet
he
should
end
his
maxim
upon
this
head
was
when
i
feathered
my
nest
it
will
be
time
enough
for
me
to
sing
dicky
nest
was
not
long
in
feathering
and
yet
dicky
had
not
begun
to
sing
still
at
moments
after
supper
or
on
a
sunday
afternoon
walking
in
a
green
lane
dicky
would
unbosom
himself
he
would
tell
you
touching
legends
of
his
boyhood
and
adolescence
then
he
would
talk
to
you
of
women
and
then
he
would
tell
you
how
it
was
that
he
came
to
forsake
literature
for
finance
he
had
begun
in
a
small
way
by
financing
little
tradesmen
little
journalists
and
actresses
in
temporary
difficulties
lending
small
sums
to
distressed
clergymen
to
governesses
and
the
mistresses
of
by
charging
a
moderate
interest
he
acquired
a
character
for
fairness
and
now
and
then
he
did
what
he
called
a
really
generous
thing
character
said
dicky
pilkington
is
capital
and
at
thirty
he
had
managed
to
save
enough
of
it
to
live
on
without
bothering
about
earning
any
more
then
by
slow
degrees
dicky
extended
his
business
he
lent
larger
sums
at
correspondingly
higher
interest
then
he
let
himself
go
he
was
caught
by
the
glory
of
the
thing
the
poetry
of
finance
he
soared
to
all
the
heights
and
sounded
all
the
depths
of
speculation
he
took
risks
with
rapture
he
fancied
himself
lending
vast
sums
at
giddy
interest
that
said
dicky
to
his
conscience
was
to
cover
his
risk
he
had
forgotten
that
character
is
capital
and
when
it
occurred
to
him
as
it
sometimes
did
that
he
was
making
rather
a
large
hole
in
it
he
would
then
achieve
some
colossal
act
of
generosity
which
set
him
on
his
legs
again
so
that
dicky
pilkington
was
always
happy
in
his
conscience
as
in
everything
else
he
had
been
prepared
to
do
the
handsome
thing
by
miss
harden
only
her
manner
had
somehow
choked
him
off
he
could
have
afforded
it
for
he
considered
this
freddy
harden
business
as
his
very
largest
deal
he
held
a
mortgage
on
the
land
from
the
river
to
the
top
of
harcombe
hill
there
was
any
amount
to
be
got
out
of
the
pictures
and
the
furniture
and
the
library
was
not
altogether
to
be
sneezed
at
it
had
been
fred
harden
last
desperate
resource
rather
poor
security
in
dicky
opinion
but
if
the
sum
advanced
had
not
been
prodigious
compared
with
the
sums
that
had
gone
before
it
the
interest
had
been
high
so
that
in
returning
from
his
tour
of
inspection
he
felt
considerably
elated
rickman
as
he
went
down
the
high
street
that
evening
saw
dicky
a
little
way
in
front
of
him
he
noticed
that
the
financial
agent
was
an
object
of
considerable
interest
to
the
people
of
harmouth
men
stood
at
shop
doors
and
street
corners
women
according
to
their
social
standing
hung
out
of
bedroom
windows
or
hid
behind
parlour
curtains
to
look
after
him
as
he
went
here
and
there
rickman
caught
sullen
and
indignant
glances
derisive
words
and
laughter
evidently
the
spirit
of
harmouth
was
hostile
to
dicky
a
harden
was
a
harden
and
sir
frederick
magnificently
complete
disaster
had
moved
even
the
townspeople
his
creditors
the
excitement
caused
by
dicky
concentrated
at
the
windows
of
the
london
and
provincial
bank
where
sir
frederick
had
had
a
large
balance
overdrawn
harmouth
high
street
is
a
lane
wide
at
the
top
and
narrow
at
the
bottom
which
gives
on
to
the
esplanade
between
the
marine
hotel
and
the
bank
at
a
certain
distance
these
buildings
cut
the
view
into
a
thin
slip
of
grey
beach
and
steep
blue
sea
the
form
of
dicky
was
now
visible
in
the
centre
of
that
slip
distinct
against
the
blue
he
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
esplanade
as
on
a
railway
platform
reading
the
paper
and
smoking
a
cigar
from
time
to
time
looking
up
with
an
expression
half
visionary
half
voluptuous
he
puffed
and
spat
in
dreamy
rhythmic
sequence
non
said
rickman
to
himself
they
change
their
skies
but
not
their
habits
when
he
came
up
with
him
he
found
the
soul
of
pilkington
disporting
itself
in
its
own
airy
element
exchanging
ideas
with
two
young
damsels
who
frolicked
on
the
beach
below
backwards
and
forwards
flew
the
banter
like
balls
of
pilkington
the
inspirer
and
the
inspired
the
of
his
last
triumphant
witticism
still
illuminated
his
countenance
when
he
turned
again
to
the
printed
page
now
owing
to
its
peculiar
construction
harmouth
high
street
acts
as
a
funnel
for
the
breezes
they
rush
through
it
as
they
rush
through
windy
gap
that
rift
in
the
coast
before
which
the
wary
fisherman
slackens
sail
just
such
an
air
was
careering
seawards
when
pilkington
was
about
to
perform
the
difficult
feat
of
folding
his
paper
backwards
it
smote
one
side
of
the
broadsheet
and
tore
it
from
his
grasp
making
it
flutter
like
a
sail
escaped
from
the
lanyard
the
breeze
dropped
it
hovered
it
waited
like
the
wanton
that
it
was
and
when
pilkington
free
hand
made
a
clutch
at
the
flying
columns
it
seized
that
moment
to
lift
his
hat
from
his
head
and
dash
it
to
the
ground
then
the
demon
of
the
wind
entered
into
and
possessed
that
high
thing
the
hat
rolled
it
curvetted
it
turned
brim
over
crown
it
took
wings
and
flew
low
and
eager
like
a
cormorant
finally
it
struck
the
beach
gathering
a
frightful
impetus
from
the
shock
and
bounded
seawards
the
pebbles
beating
from
it
a
thin
note
never
was
any
created
thing
so
tortured
with
indecent
merriment
in
the
face
of
doom
the
end
seemed
certain
for
dicky
pilkington
though
he
joined
in
the
hysterics
of
the
crowd
had
not
compromised
his
dignity
by
pursuit
when
just
as
the
hat
touched
the
foam
of
perdition
molly
trick
the
fat
bathing
woman
interposed
the
bulwark
of
her
body
she
stooped
she
spread
her
wide
skirts
and
the
maniac
leapt
into
them
as
into
a
haven
the
young
men
who
watched
this
breezy
incident
over
the
blinds
of
the
london
and
provincial
bank
were
immensely
diverted
even
rickman
laughed
as
dicky
turned
to
him
his
cheerful
face
buffeted
by
the
wind
pilkington
had
put
up
at
the
same
hotel
as
rickman
and
they
found
themselves
alone
at
the
air
this
said
pilkington
i
do
know
how
you
feel
young
but
there
a
voice
that
tells
me
i
shall
dine
pilkington
was
not
deceived
by
that
prophetic
voice
he
dined
with
appetite
undiminished
by
his
companion
gloom
from
time
to
time
he
rallied
him
on
his
coyness
under
the
fascinations
of
lager
beer
apricots
and
devonshire
cream
well
razors
he
said
at
last
and
wot
do
you
think
of
the
harden
library
rickman
was
discreet
oh
it
is
bad
for
a
private
show
sir
frederick
does
seem
to
have
been
much
of
a
collector
was
he
though
in
his
own
line
he
was
a
pretty
considerable
collector
quite
a
what
call
virtuoso
not
very
much
virtue
about
him
i
imagine
well
whatever
there
may
have
been
in
ten
years
that
joker
went
through
his
capital
as
if
it
had
been
a
paper
hoop
slap
through
it
and
out
at
the
other
side
on
his
feet
grinning
at
you
how
did
he
manage
it
cards
horses
women
everything
you
can
name
said
dicky
amusing
and
at
the
same
time
expensive
they
precious
slow
down
here
in
the
country
but
get
up
to
town
and
there
nothing
like
for
going
the
pace
when
they
go
it
his
velocity
must
have
been
something
tremendous
to
judge
by
the
smash
rickman
was
looking
at
the
financial
agent
with
an
expression
which
some
people
might
have
been
inclined
to
resent
but
gaiety
was
proof
against
criticism
what
did
he
die
of
rickman
asked
slowly
what
a
beastly
question
to
ask
at
dinner
he
died
like
most
people
of
his
way
of
living
if
freddy
harden
had
had
opportunities
equal
to
his
talents
he
would
have
smashed
up
ten
years
ago
talent
was
the
word
for
it
it
was
genius
genius
i
see
and
when
you
come
across
a
poor
struggling
devil
with
a
gift
like
that
you
long
to
be
kind
to
him
do
you
to
bring
him
forward
to
remove
every
obstacle
to
his
career
well
yes
i
suppose
i
did
run
harden
for
all
he
was
worth
queer
fish
harden
he
used
to
rave
like
a
lunatic
about
his
daughter
but
i
do
suppose
he
spent
a
fiver
on
her
in
his
life
it
pretty
rough
on
her
this
business
but
loocher
do
she
got
cheek
enough
for
half
a
dozen
dicky
chuckled
at
the
memory
of
his
discomfiture
i
like
it
i
like
a
girl
with
some
bounce
in
her
trust
her
to
fall
on
her
little
tootsies
anywhere
you
drop
her
i
ca
say
you
made
the
falling
very
easy
for
her
dicky
bright
face
clouded
wot
the
devil
has
that
got
to
do
with
me
i
done
level
best
why
i
could
have
cleaned
them
out
years
ago
if
i
chosen
now
just
to
show
you
what
sort
of
fellow
freddy
harden
was
last
time
i
ever
saw
him
poor
chap
he
told
me
that
girl
of
his
was
a
regular
musical
genius
just
a
little
more
technique
you
know
and
she
beat
paderewski
into
a
cocked
hat
she
was
wonderful
that
the
way
he
piled
it
on
and
it
may
have
been
all
true
he
could
have
made
a
fortune
fiddling
if
he
had
been
as
proud
as
satan
and
as
lazy
as
a
wombat
well
i
said
if
that
was
so
i
take
her
up
and
run
her
as
a
for
friendship
mind
you
i
liked
freddy
and
i
was
sorry
for
him
she
could
pay
me
if
she
pulled
it
off
if
not
she
could
let
it
stand
over
till
the
day
of
judgement
rickman
flushed
did
you
know
anything
of
miss
harden
then
not
i
never
set
eyes
on
her
she
might
have
been
as
ugly
as
sin
for
all
i
knew
i
risked
that
what
did
sir
frederick
say
to
your
generous
proposal
dicky
face
became
luminous
at
the
recollection
he
said
he
see
me
d
d
first
but
i
meant
it
i
do
it
if
she
asked
me
prettily
have
you
any
notion
how
she
be
left
after
all
this
yes
there
the
house
and
her
mother
money
freddy
could
get
at
that
when
it
all
settled
up
she
ca
be
so
badly
off
i
fancy
still
it
a
beastly
in
the
face
poor
girl
by
jove
she
does
stand
up
to
it
in
form
too
too
d
d
well
bred
to
let
you
know
she
hit
you
would
think
she
be
plucky
to
look
at
her
would
you
it
queer
how
the
breeding
comes
out
in
a
woman
rickman
held
himself
in
with
difficulty
when
pearls
are
cast
before
swine
you
look
for
depreciation
as
a
matter
of
course
you
would
be
infinitely
more
revolted
if
instead
of
trampling
them
under
their
feet
the
animals
insisted
on
wearing
them
in
their
snouts
so
pilkington
rootling
in
miss
harden
affairs
pilkington
posing
as
miss
harden
adviser
pilkington
adorning
his
obscene
conversation
with
miss
harden
name
was
to
rickman
an
infinitely
more
abominable
beast
than
pilkington
behaving
according
to
his
nature
but
to
quarrel
with
pilkington
on
this
head
would
have
provoked
the
vulgarest
of
comments
and
for
miss
harden
sake
he
restrained
himself
dicky
remained
unconscious
i
glad
you
put
me
up
to
offering
some
of
those
books
back
it
goes
against
me
to
sell
them
but
what
the
devil
am
i
to
do
ca
tell
you
i
sha
collar
all
this
furniture
either
i
buy
in
some
of
it
and
return
it
the
decent
thing
would
be
to
give
her
back
poor
freddy
portrait
he
passed
his
hand
over
a
bunch
of
bananas
he
selected
one
pinched
it
smelt
it
put
it
down
and
took
another
it
a
pity
it
a
watts
that
portrait
he
murmured
dreamily
he
seemed
to
be
wrestling
with
himself
and
apparently
he
overcame
when
he
had
eaten
his
banana
his
face
was
flushed
and
almost
firm
i
not
take
it
he
sticks
in
my
throat
does
freddy
rickman
left
the
table
if
he
had
disliked
dicky
when
he
was
callous
he
loathed
him
when
he
was
kind
he
threw
open
the
window
and
sat
on
the
ledge
the
breeze
had
died
down
and
the
heat
in
the
little
hotel
was
stifling
across
the
passage
glasses
clinked
in
the
bar
sounding
a
suitable
accompaniment
to
the
voice
of
dicky
from
time
to
time
bursts
of
laughter
came
from
the
overhead
outside
there
in
the
night
the
sea
smothered
these
jarring
human
notes
with
its
own
majestic
tumult
rickman
giving
up
his
sickened
senses
to
the
night
and
the
sea
was
fortunate
enough
to
miss
a
great
deal
that
pilkington
was
saying
for
dicky
still
seated
at
the
table
talked
on
he
had
mingled
soda
with
whisky
and
as
he
drank
it
the
veil
of
our
earthly
life
lifted
for
dicky
and
there
was
revealed
to
him
the
underlying
verity
the
fabric
of
the
world
in
other
words
dicky
had
arrived
at
the
inspired
moment
of
the
evening
and
was
chanting
the
hymn
of
finance
look
said
dicky
at
the
power
it
gives
you
now
all
you
writing
chaps
you
know
you
not
in
it
you
not
in
it
at
all
simply
and
dodging
round
the
outside
you
a
chance
of
really
seeing
the
show
whereas
look
at
i
go
and
take
my
seat
plump
down
in
the
middle
of
the
stage
box
i
got
my
ear
to
the
heart
of
and
my
on
its
pulse
i
got
a
grip
of
realities
you
say
you
want
to
life
very
well
it
when
all
said
and
done
you
only
got
a
picture
and
wot
a
picture
if
it
ever
so
lifelike
you
got
a
bit
nearer
to
the
real
thing
i
tell
you
you
are
in
it
with
me
i
have
been
a
writer
myself
if
i
thought
it
was
good
enough
i
began
that
way
but
as
to
going
back
to
it
you
might
just
as
well
expect
me
to
go
back
to
kissing
a
woman
photo
when
i
can
put
my
arm
round
her
waist
and
dicky
gracefully
descending
on
the
wings
of
his
metaphor
alighted
on
miss
poppy
grace
but
to
rickman
the
figure
of
poppy
once
an
obsession
was
now
as
indistinct
as
the
figure
of
dicky
seen
through
a
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
he
was
roused
by
a
more
direct
appeal
and
what
seemed
to
him
a
violent
change
of
theme
did
you
notice
what
rum
eyes
miss
harden
got
they
have
taught
her
how
to
use
though
hi
ricky
are
you
going
to
join
us
in
a
drink
no
i
not
his
tone
implied
that
he
was
not
going
to
join
pilkington
in
anything
you
seem
a
bit
cut
up
on
miss
harden
account
if
you
mean
that
i
think
she
been
most
infernally
treated
i
do
h
well
i
will
say
the
wind
is
not
exactly
tempered
to
that
shorn
lamb
but
it
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
any
good
queer
how
things
are
mixed
up
in
this
world
you
would
think
there
was
much
connexion
between
miss
harden
and
miss
poppy
grace
would
you
well
wot
loocher
loss
is
popsie
gain
if
that
any
consolation
i
certainly
do
see
the
connexion
no
i
say
ca
you
shut
the
window
that
d
d
sea
makes
such
a
noise
i
ca
hear
myself
speak
i
was
going
to
say
i
some
notion
of
running
poppy
on
her
own
before
long
and
i
think
i
i
can
do
it
out
of
this
haul
before
she
signs
another
contract
of
course
we
expect
you
and
your
friends
to
back
us
dicky
voice
came
slightly
muffled
from
the
depths
of
his
long
tumbler
rickman
turned
round
what
did
you
say
about
bacchus
he
had
turned
in
anger
but
at
the
spectacle
presented
by
pilkington
he
laughed
aloud
in
the
insolence
of
his
youth
shut
that
window
ca
you
i
say
if
you
can
get
at
any
of
the
papers
and
give
them
the
tip
well
rickman
hand
closed
fiercely
over
the
top
of
a
syphon
pilkington
followed
the
movement
with
an
innocent
but
by
no
means
unobservant
eye
only
the
other
day
they
had
been
rivals
for
the
favour
of
miss
poppy
grace
which
seemed
to
be
very
evenly
divided
between
them
if
rickman
had
her
heart
he
pilkington
held
her
by
the
power
of
the
purse
jealous
he
might
be
but
jealousy
counted
for
little
in
the
great
mind
of
pilkington
human
passions
were
the
stuff
he
worked
in
where
they
raged
highest
it
was
his
to
ride
on
the
whirlwind
and
direct
the
storm
if
in
poppy
case
they
raged
too
high
his
position
as
creditor
gave
him
a
tight
grip
of
young
rickman
on
the
other
hand
rickman
was
now
a
junior
journalist
and
pilkington
amid
the
wreck
of
morals
and
the
crash
of
creeds
had
preserved
a
simple
childlike
faith
in
the
omnipotence
of
the
press
so
if
it
was
madness
for
rickman
to
irritate
pilkington
it
was
not
altogether
expedient
for
pilkington
to
irritate
him
look
here
razors
said
he
you
need
go
shying
any
syphons
about
there
nothing
behind
this
show
but
business
what
i
do
for
miss
grace
i
do
for
cold
cash
see
of
course
i
take
an
interest
in
the
girl
interest
at
something
like
a
hundred
and
fifty
per
i
suppose
that
about
the
figure
with
your
permission
i
remove
that
out
of
your
way
what
do
you
think
of
it
my
idea
i
mean
i
think
there
a
d
d
lot
more
interest
than
principle
in
it
you
young
goat
i
out
of
it
honour
bright
so
if
you
feel
inclined
to
slog
away
and
boom
the
lady
there
no
reason
why
you
should
is
there
any
reason
why
i
should
inquired
rickman
with
treacherous
severity
so
immense
was
his
calm
that
dicky
was
taken
in
by
it
and
blundered
well
yes
said
he
in
that
case
we
might
consider
our
little
account
settled
our
little
account
dicky
will
be
run
up
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
paper
if
you
do
take
care
wot
mean
i
mean
that
when
you
got
a
particularly
filthy
job
on
hand
as
well
to
keep
away
from
people
who
are
not
fond
of
dirt
at
any
rate
i
advise
you
not
to
come
too
near
me
dicky
for
the
first
time
that
evening
looked
uncomfortable
it
occurred
to
dicky
that
whisky
and
soda
was
not
the
very
best
drink
to
talk
business
on
i
noticed
rickman
said
he
that
since
you
been
living
down
in
the
country
you
do
seem
able
to
understand
a
joke
but
rickman
had
got
his
legs
on
the
other
side
of
the
window
ledge
and
as
dicky
approached
him
he
slid
down
on
to
the
esplanade
and
slipped
into
the
night
chapter
xxxiii
hardly
knowing
how
he
got
there
he
found
himself
on
the
top
of
harcombe
hill
his
head
was
bare
and
the
soles
of
his
thin
slippers
were
cut
with
the
flints
of
the
hillside
lane
he
had
walked
walked
walked
driven
by
a
fury
in
his
body
and
a
fever
in
his
feet
his
first
idea
had
been
to
get
as
far
away
as
possible
from
his
companion
he
felt
that
he
never
could
be
clean
again
after
his
contact
with
dicky
how
had
the
thing
happened
yesterday
london
seemed
as
far
away
from
harmouth
as
babylon
from
arcadia
and
rickman
was
not
more
infinitely
removed
from
lucia
than
lucia
was
from
poppy
yet
here
they
were
all
three
tangled
together
in
dicky
complicated
he
held
them
all
lucia
by
her
honour
poppy
by
her
vanity
and
him
rickman
by
the
lusts
and
follies
of
his
youth
this
was
what
it
had
led
him
to
that
superb
triumphal
progress
of
the
passions
in
language
as
plain
as
he
could
put
it
he
he
had
been
offered
a
bribe
to
advertise
poppy
grace
for
the
benefit
of
dicky
who
kept
her
to
advertise
a
little
painted
he
disposed
of
poor
poppy
in
a
powerful
word
which
would
have
given
her
propriety
a
fit
if
it
could
have
heard
him
that
he
himself
should
ever
have
been
infatuated
with
poppy
seemed
to
him
now
incredible
monstrous
in
the
last
three
weeks
he
had
not
only
grown
sober
but
mature
that
youth
of
his
which
once
seemed
immortal
had
then
ceased
to
be
a
part
of
him
he
had
cut
himself
loose
from
it
and
put
it
behind
him
with
all
its
miseries
and
tumults
and
pollutions
but
he
could
get
rid
of
it
like
an
unclean
spirit
cast
out
of
him
it
seemed
to
have
entered
into
dicky
as
into
a
convenient
herd
of
swine
and
in
dicky
detestable
person
it
rose
up
against
him
and
pursued
him
for
dicky
though
sensual
as
any
swine
was
cautious
dicky
even
with
an
unclean
spirit
in
him
was
not
in
the
least
likely
to
rush
violently
down
any
steep
place
into
the
sea
and
so
perish
out
of
his
life
that
dicky
should
have
appeared
on
his
last
night
here
seemed
the
vilest
stroke
that
fate
had
dealt
him
yet
but
dicky
could
not
follow
him
up
harcombe
hill
he
looked
before
him
the
lights
of
harmouth
opened
out
a
thin
line
to
the
esplanade
dividing
the
sea
from
the
land
by
fire
instead
of
foam
strewn
in
the
bed
of
the
valley
they
revealed
as
through
some
pure
and
liquid
medium
its
darkness
and
its
depth
above
them
the
great
flank
of
muttersmoor
stretched
like
the
rampart
of
the
night
night
itself
was
twilight
against
that
black
and
tragic
line
and
rickman
standing
bareheaded
on
the
hillside
was
lifted
up
out
of
his
immense
misery
and
unrest
he
remembered
how
this
land
that
he
loved
so
passionately
had
once
refused
him
the
inspiration
that
he
sought
and
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
could
refuse
him
nothing
that
nature
under
cover
of
the
darkness
gave
up
her
inmost
ultimate
secret
and
if
it
be
true
that
nature
innermost
ultimate
secret
is
known
only
to
the
pure
it
was
a
sign
of
his
own
cleansing
this
sense
of
comfort
and
reconciliation
of
unspoiled
communion
of
profound
immeasurable
peace
in
that
moment
his
genius
seemed
to
have
passed
behind
veils
upon
veils
of
separation
to
possess
that
tender
and
tragic
beauty
to
become
one
with
the
soul
of
the
divine
illimitable
night
he
was
not
in
the
least
deceived
as
to
the
true
source
of
his
inspiration
in
all
this
if
you
went
back
far
enough
his
body
counted
his
body
which
he
had
made
a
house
of
shame
and
hunger
and
desire
shaken
by
its
own
shivering
nerves
and
leaping
desperate
pulses
but
what
of
that
now
what
matter
since
that
tumult
of
his
blood
had
set
throbbing
such
subtle
such
infinite
vibrations
in
his
soul
was
what
counted
he
could
tell
by
it
the
quality
and
immensity
of
his
passion
by
just
that
spiritual
resonance
and
response
it
was
the
measure
of
lucia
power
to
move
him
the
measure
too
of
his
nearness
to
her
no
less
than
of
his
separation
she
could
not
take
away
what
she
had
given
and
among
his
sources
of
inspiration
of
the
unique
and
unforgettable
secret
that
had
passed
into
him
with
the
night
on
harcombe
hill
as
he
looked
towards
muttersmoor
she
also
counted
she
would
be
always
there
a
part
of
it
a
part
of
him
whether
she
would
or
no
if
that
was
any
consolation
chapter
xxxiv
he
had
made
no
empty
promise
when
he
assured
her
that
he
would
do
his
best
for
there
was
something
that
could
still
be
done
he
built
great
hopes
on
the
result
of
the
coming
interview
with
his
father
his
idea
was
to
go
up
to
town
by
the
early
morning
train
and
talk
the
whole
thing
over
as
calmly
as
might
be
he
would
first
of
all
appeal
to
his
father
better
feelings
he
would
make
him
see
this
thing
as
he
saw
it
he
would
rouse
in
him
the
spirit
of
integrity
the
spirit
of
mercy
and
pity
the
spirit
of
justice
and
chivalry
and
honour
but
if
all
the
arts
of
persuasion
failed
to
touch
him
rickman
junior
had
in
reserve
one
powerful
argument
against
which
rickman
senior
would
hardly
be
able
to
contend
there
would
no
doubt
be
inspirations
but
as
to
the
main
lines
of
his
pleading
he
was
already
clear
he
felt
entirely
confident
and
as
he
rose
at
five
the
next
morning
to
catch
that
early
train
rickman
senior
was
not
in
the
shop
when
rickman
junior
arrived
on
the
scene
he
was
in
a
great
bare
room
on
an
upper
floor
of
the
department
he
looked
more
than
ever
studious
and
ascetic
having
exchanged
his
soft
felt
hat
for
a
velvet
and
his
frock
coat
for
a
thin
alpaca
he
was
attended
by
a
charwoman
with
scrubbing
brush
and
pail
a
boy
with
ladder
and
broom
and
a
carpenter
with
and
pencil
he
moved
among
them
with
his
most
solemn
most
visionary
air
the
air
not
so
much
of
a
wesleyan
minister
as
of
a
priest
engaged
in
some
high
service
of
dedication
he
was
in
fact
making
arrangements
for
the
reception
of
no
less
than
fifteen
thousand
volumes
the
collection
of
the
late
sir
joseph
harden
of
court
house
harmouth
and
as
he
looked
around
him
his
face
expressed
the
smooth
and
delicately
voluptuous
satisfaction
of
the
dreamer
who
has
touched
his
dream
this
look
of
beatitude
faded
perceptibly
when
the
message
came
that
keith
was
in
the
front
shop
and
wished
to
see
him
keith
it
appeared
had
no
time
to
spare
isaac
had
in
fact
experienced
a
slight
shock
at
the
earliness
of
keith
return
his
first
thought
was
that
at
the
last
moment
there
had
been
some
serious
hitch
with
pilkington
he
found
keith
sitting
before
the
counter
in
the
attitude
of
a
rather
imperious
customer
but
the
warm
pressure
of
his
hand
removed
this
disagreeable
effect
of
superiority
keith
face
wore
signs
of
worry
and
agitation
that
confirmed
isaac
original
fear
well
he
said
a
little
anxiously
i
did
expect
you
back
as
early
as
this
i
have
come
to
stop
i
got
to
catch
the
back
again
i
came
up
because
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
come
said
isaac
into
the
office
he
laid
his
hand
on
keith
shoulder
as
they
went
he
felt
very
kindly
towards
him
at
that
moment
his
heart
was
big
with
trust
in
the
brilliant
impetuous
boy
when
he
touched
keith
hand
he
had
felt
that
intellectual
virtue
had
gone
out
of
it
he
guessed
that
there
was
a
crisis
in
the
affairs
of
the
house
of
rickman
and
that
keith
had
come
with
warning
and
with
help
he
knew
his
power
of
swift
and
effectual
action
in
a
crisis
yes
yes
keith
wits
might
go
but
he
was
safe
enough
when
he
had
gathered
his
wool
well
he
repeated
lifting
grave
interrogative
eyebrows
he
had
seated
himself
but
keith
remained
standing
a
sign
with
him
of
extreme
perturbation
i
thought
i
could
explain
things
better
if
i
saw
you
he
began
quite
so
quite
so
i
hope
you
have
come
to
tell
me
there
been
any
well
i
told
you
as
much
when
i
wrote
i
understood
you
advised
me
to
withdraw
because
you
thought
pilkington
wanted
a
big
price
i
did
know
what
he
wanted
i
knew
what
we
ought
to
give
that
was
settled
by
looking
in
the
register
you
do
mean
to
say
going
to
back
out
of
it
keith
was
so
preoccupied
that
he
failed
to
see
the
drift
of
his
father
questioning
you
see
he
continued
following
his
own
thoughts
it
not
as
if
we
had
only
ourselves
to
consider
miss
harden
ah
yes
pilkington
did
make
some
mention
of
a
young
lady
she
was
good
enough
to
say
she
rather
we
bought
the
library
than
anybody
i
think
we
bound
to
justify
her
confidence
certainly
most
certainly
we
are
said
isaac
with
solemnity
he
was
agreeably
flattered
by
this
tribute
to
the
greatness
of
his
house
i
thought
i
did
right
in
promising
that
we
would
do
our
very
best
for
her
of
course
you
were
but
that
all
settled
pilkington
knows
that
i
prepared
to
meet
his
wishes
his
wishes
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
he
was
anxious
to
have
a
sum
to
hand
over
to
the
young
lady
in
fact
he
wrote
me
a
most
touching
appeal
what
d
d
impertinence
he
had
no
business
to
appeal
well
it
was
strictly
but
i
think
under
the
circumstances
was
morally
justified
and
i
think
he
will
consider
i
responded
very
handsomely
you
made
him
an
offer
then
i
made
it
three
days
ago
provisionally
and
he
accepted
it
said
isaac
with
some
heat
why
he
got
the
cheque
for
how
much
for
twelve
hundred
my
dear
father
you
know
really
that
wo
do
do
you
think
it
was
foolish
to
pay
the
two
hundred
extra
isaac
gazed
at
him
over
his
fine
spectacles
and
as
he
gazed
he
kept
drawing
his
beard
slowly
through
one
lean
and
meditative
hand
it
was
thus
that
he
grasped
his
son
argument
and
drew
it
to
a
point
foolish
it
was
do
you
see
we
we
simply
ca
do
it
why
you
said
yourself
we
could
go
as
far
as
four
thousand
five
or
four
thousand
at
the
very
least
keith
looked
steadily
at
his
father
who
was
too
deeply
and
solemnly
absorbed
to
perceive
the
meaning
of
the
look
that
was
not
quite
what
i
said
i
said
if
we
were
prepared
to
go
so
far
it
was
our
duty
to
withdraw
i
thought
i
had
made
that
clear
to
you
you
made
it
clear
to
me
why
you
objecting
to
that
two
hundred
now
isaac
was
beginning
to
feel
that
stupidity
was
now
his
refuge
i
not
objecting
to
your
reckless
extravagance
as
you
seem
to
think
i
trying
to
suggest
that
twelve
hundred
is
a
ridiculously
small
offer
for
a
collection
which
ca
be
worth
less
than
four
thousand
it
may
be
worth
that
to
a
collector
it
is
worth
it
to
me
it
worth
it
to
any
dealer
who
knows
his
business
pretty
business
if
you
have
to
buy
at
fancy
prices
and
sell
at
a
risk
i
allowed
for
the
risk
in
the
valuation
i
always
do
there
one
point
where
you
extravagant
if
you
like
what
the
use
of
paying
me
for
advice
if
you
wo
take
it
isaac
stupidity
increased
do
you
mean
paying
you
for
your
advice
paying
a
valuer
then
if
you
wo
accept
his
valuation
so
unwilling
was
he
to
admit
the
sharpness
of
his
father
practice
that
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
they
had
merely
disagreed
on
a
point
of
connoisseurship
my
advice
if
you
remember
was
to
withdraw
decently
or
pay
a
decent
price
i
paid
my
price
and
i
certainly
not
going
to
withdraw
well
but
i
afraid
if
you
wo
withdraw
i
must
you
have
paid
price
and
i
ca
be
responsible
isaac
caressed
his
beard
gently
and
looked
at
keith
with
a
gaze
so
clear
that
it
might
have
passed
for
pure
he
was
saying
to
himself
as
he
had
said
once
before
there
a
woman
in
it
do
you
see
keith
broke
out
the
atrocious
position
that
i
in
i
promised
miss
harden
that
we
do
our
best
for
her
and
now
taking
advantage
of
the
situation
to
drive
an
iniquitous
bargain
with
her
as
keith
made
this
powerful
statement
isaac
smiled
puzzled
and
indulgent
as
at
some
play
of
diverting
but
incomprehensible
humour
in
fact
he
never
could
clearly
distinguish
between
keith
sense
of
humour
and
his
sense
of
honour
both
seemed
equally
removed
from
the
safe
intelligible
methods
of
ordinary
men
he
was
sure
but
what
there
was
something
fine
in
it
something
in
keeping
with
the
intellectual
extravagance
that
distinguished
his
son
from
other
people
sons
there
were
moments
when
it
amused
and
interested
him
but
he
did
not
care
to
have
it
obtruded
on
him
in
business
hours
i
driving
no
bargain
with
the
lady
at
all
the
books
are
hers
they
pilkington
i
dealing
with
him
and
you
refuse
to
consider
her
interests
how
can
you
say
so
when
i
paying
two
hundred
more
than
i
need
do
on
her
account
alone
you
must
explain
that
clearly
to
her
not
i
you
can
explain
it
yourself
to
me
you
see
the
whole
simply
a
colossal
fraud
i
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
it
you
anything
to
do
with
it
i
made
the
bargain
and
i
keep
to
it
very
well
then
you
must
choose
between
your
bargain
and
me
wot
do
you
mean
choose
between
my
bargain
and
you
i
mean
exactly
what
i
say
i
know
if
you
do
that
that
two
hundred
ought
to
be
three
thousand
and
if
it
is
paid
i
shall
have
to
shunt
the
business
i
never
meant
to
stay
in
it
for
ever
but
in
this
case
i
shall
simply
clear
out
at
once
that
all
see
no
i
do
see
i
do
see
myself
paying
three
thousand
to
a
man
who
willing
to
take
two
hundred
see
my
point
i
mean
if
the
three
thousand
is
paid
i
go
on
the
other
hand
if
it
is
paid
i
stay
this
was
one
of
those
inspirations
on
which
he
had
counted
and
it
presented
itself
to
him
as
a
clincher
at
the
same
instant
he
realized
that
he
was
selling
himself
into
slavery
for
three
thousand
pounds
no
not
for
three
thousand
pounds
for
his
honour
sake
and
lucia
harden
isaac
looked
graver
alarmed
even
it
struck
him
that
keith
peculiar
vein
of
extravagance
was
becoming
dangerous
you
can
calculate
the
interest
at
four
per
and
knock
a
hundred
and
twenty
off
my
salary
if
you
like
but
i
stay
it
pretty
clear
is
it
i
think
on
the
whole
it
might
be
as
well
for
you
to
close
with
the
offer
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
worth
anything
at
all
i
worth
three
thousand
i
have
priced
your
services
yet
isaac
gaze
shifted
he
was
beginning
to
feel
something
of
that
profound
discomfort
he
had
experienced
before
in
the
presence
of
his
son
now
when
you
spoke
to
miss
had
she
any
notion
of
the
value
of
the
library
none
whatever
till
i
told
her
do
you
mean
to
stand
there
and
say
that
you
were
fool
enough
to
tell
her
certainly
i
thought
it
only
fair
to
her
and
did
you
think
it
was
fair
to
me
why
not
if
you
not
dealing
with
her
what
difference
could
it
make
he
said
to
himself
i
got
him
there
isaac
was
indeed
staggered
by
the
blow
and
lost
his
admirable
composure
do
you
know
wot
you
done
you
compromised
me
compromised
the
honour
and
the
reputation
of
my
and
you
done
it
for
a
woman
you
ca
it
you
a
perfect
fool
where
women
are
concerned
if
anybody
compromised
i
think
it
me
i
pledged
my
word
and
wot
business
had
you
to
pledge
it
oh
i
thought
it
safe
i
did
think
you
dishonour
my
draft
on
your
reputation
draft
indeed
that
it
you
might
just
as
well
taken
my
out
of
the
drawer
there
and
forged
my
signature
at
the
bottom
why
it
moral
forgery
that
wot
it
is
i
can
see
it
all
you
thought
you
were
acting
very
generous
and
grand
with
this
young
lady
i
say
you
were
mean
you
did
it
on
the
cheap
you
no
expense
or
risk
or
responsibility
at
all
i
know
you
ca
see
it
that
way
but
that
it
is
keith
did
not
defend
himself
against
this
view
of
his
conduct
and
isaac
preserved
his
attitude
of
moral
superiority
i
not
blaming
you
my
boy
it
my
own
fault
i
should
sent
you
out
like
that
cart
blansh
so
to
speak
and
without
it
i
should
given
you
some
responsibility
oh
thanks
i
could
very
well
have
done
with
more
than
i
had
ah

know
the
kind
of
responsibility

mean
you
seem
very
ready
to
play
fast
and
loose
with
my
business
i
daresay
now
you
think
since
you
much
to
lose
you
much
to
gain
well
frankly
i
ca
see
that
i
have
much
but
i
got
to
catch
a
train
in
twenty
minutes
and
i
want
to
know
what
you
going
to
do
am
i
worth
three
thousand
or
am
i
not
you
worth
a
great
deal
more
to
me
you
got
an
education
i
got
you
got
brains
you
got
tact
when
you
choose
to
use
it
you
got
expert
knowledge
and
i
ca
carry
on
my
business
without
that
i
not
unreasonable
i
can
see
that
you

act
to
advantage

made
responsible
if
you

any
direct
interest
in
the
business
he
fixed
his
son
with
a
glance
that
was
nothing
if
not
spiritually
fine
keith
found
himself
struggling
against
an
infamous
an
intolerable
suspicion
and
that
said
isaac
is
wot
i
mean
to
give
you
i
thought
it
well
over
and
i
believe
it
worth
my
while
he
went
on
joining
his
like
a
man
who
fits
careful
thought
to
careful
thought
suggesting
the
final
adjustment
of
a
plan
long
ago
determined
and
approved
for
something
in
keith
face
made
him
anxious
that
this
offer
should
not
appear
to
be
born
of
the
subject
under
discussion
it
was
always
my
intention
to
take
you
into
partnership
i
mean
to
do
it
quite
so
soon
but
rather
than
this
talk
of
flinging
up
the
business
i
prepared
to
do
it
now
on
the
same
conditions
now
that
rickman
should
eventually
become
rickman
and
son
was
a
very
natural
development
and
in
any
ordinary
circumstances
isaac
could
hardly
have
made
a
more
innocent
and
suitable
proposal
but
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
keith
to
ignore
its
significance
it
meant
that
his
father
was
ready
to
buy
his
services
at
any
price
to
bribe
him
into
silence
his
worst
misgivings
had
never
included
such
a
possibility
in
fact
before
going
down
to
devonshire
he
had
never
had
any
serious
misgivings
at
all
his
position
in
his
father
shop
had
hitherto
presented
no
difficulties
to
a
sensitive
honour
he
had
not
been
sure
that
his
honour
was
particularly
sensitive
not
more
so
he
supposed
than
other
people
acting
as
part
of
the
machinery
of
rickman
he
had
sometimes
made
a
clever
bargain
he
had
never
so
far
as
he
knew
driven
a
hard
one
he
was
expected
to
make
clever
bargains
to
buy
cheap
and
sell
dear
to
watch
people
faces
lowering
the
price
by
their
anxiety
to
sell
raising
it
by
their
eagerness
to
buy
that
was
his
stern
duty
in
the
department
but
there
had
been
so
many
occasions
on
which
he
had
never
done
his
duty
times
when
he
was
tempted
to
actual
defiance
of
it
when
a
wistful
calculating
look
in
the
eyes
of
some
seedy
scholar
would
knock
all
the
moral
fibre
out
of
him
and
a
two
and
sixpenny
book
would
go
for
ninepence
or
a
shilling
and
such
was
his
conception
of
loyalty
to
rickman
that
he
generally
paid
for
these
excesses
out
of
his
own
pocket
so
that
conscience
was
satisfied
both
ways
therefore
there
had
been
no
moral
element
in
his
dislike
to
rickman
he
had
shrunk
from
it
with
the
aversion
of
the
mind
not
with
this
sickening
hatred
of
the
soul
after
three
weeks
of
lucia
harden
society
he
had
perceived
how
sordid
were
the
beginnings
from
which
his
life
had
sprung
as
his
boyish
dreams
had
been
wrought
like
a
broidery
of
stars
on
the
floor
of
the
so
honour
an
unattainable
ideal
had
stood
out
in
forlorn
splendour
against
a
darker
and
a
dirtier
background
he
had
felt
himself
obscurely
tainted
and
involved
now
he
realized
as
he
had
never
realized
before
that
the
foundations
of
rickman
were
laid
in
bottomless
corruption
it
was
a
house
built
not
only
on
every
vile
and
vulgar
art
known
to
trade
but
on
many
instances
of
such
a
work
as
this
and
it
was
into
this
pit
of
infamy
that
his
father
was
blandly
inviting
him
to
descend
he
had
such
an
abominably
clear
vision
of
it
that
he
writhed
and
shuddered
with
shame
and
disgust
he
could
hardly
have
suffered
more
if
he
had
gone
down
into
it
bodily
himself
he
endured
in
imagination
the
emotions
that
his
father
should
have
felt
and
apparently
did
not
feel
he
came
out
of
his
shudderings
and
writhings
unspeakably
consoled
and
clean
knowing
that
it
is
with
such
nausea
and
pangs
that
the
soul
of
honour
is
born
their
eyes
met
and
it
was
the
elder
rickman
turn
for
bitterness
it
had
come
the
moment
that
he
had
dreaded
he
was
afraid
to
meet
his
son
eyes
for
he
knew
that
they
had
judged
him
he
felt
that
he
stood
revealed
in
that
sudden
illumination
of
the
boy
radiant
soul
an
instinct
of
now
prompted
him
to
belittle
character
he
had
found
amazing
comfort
in
the
reflection
that
keith
was
not
all
that
he
ought
to
be
as
far
as
isaac
could
make
out
he
was
always
running
after
the
women
he
was
a
regular
young
profligate
an
infidel
he
was
what
right
had
he
to
sit
in
judgement
shrewd
even
in
anger
he
took
refuge
in
an
adroit
misconstruction
of
keith
language
i
lay
down
conditions
i
much
too
anxious
about
you
i
want
to
see
you
in
a
house
of
your
own
settled
down
and
married
to
some
good
girl
who
keep
you
steady
and
respectable
a
simple
straightforward
offer
and
you
take
it
or
leave
it
i
take
it
on
two
conditions
first
as
i
said
before
that
we
either
withdraw
or
pay
over
that
three
thousand
second
that
in
the
future
no
bargains
are
made
without
my
knowledge
and
consent
that
means
giving
me
the
entire
control
of
my
own
department
it
means
reducing
me
to
a
mere
cypher
such
bargains
are
questions
for
experts
and
should
be
left
to
experts
if
i
were
to
leave
them
to
experts
like
you
i
should
be
bankrupt
in
a
fortnight
i
sorry
but
you
must
choose
between
your
methods
and
mine
ten
minutes
to
do
it
in
it
wo
take
ten
minutes
to
see
what
will
ruin
me
quickest
as
i
told
you
before
i
not
going
back
on
my
bargain
nor
i
on
mine
isaac
spent
three
minutes
in
reflection
he
reflected
first
that
keith
had
been
in
the
past
a
young
profligate
secondly
that
he
was
at
the
present
moment
in
love
thirdly
that
in
the
future
he
would
infallibly
be
hungry
he
would
think
very
differently
when
he
had
forgotten
the
lady
or
if
he
did
think
differently
he
would
behave
differently
when
his
belly
pinched
him
isaac
was
a
firm
believer
in
the
persuasive
power
of
the
primitive
appetites
only
seven
minutes
murmured
keith
i
sorry
to
hurry
you
father
but
i
really
must
catch
that
train
wait
steady
do
you
know
wot
you
about
you
sha
do
anything
rash
for
want
of
a
clear
understanding
mind
as
you
stand
there
you
nothing
but
a
paid
and
if
you
leave
the
shop
you
leave
it
without
a
penny
to
your
name
quite
so
my
name
will
hardly
be
any
the
worse
for
that
you
sure
you
decided
you
really
do
not
want
to
keep
me
after
all
did
he
want
to
keep
him
to
be
unsettled
in
his
conscience
and
ruined
in
his
trade
what
after
all
had
keith
brought
into
the
business
but
three
alien
and
terrible
spirits
the
spirit
of
superiority
the
spirit
of
criticism
the
spirit
of
tempestuous
youth
he
would
be
glad
to
be
rid
of
him
to
be
rid
of
those
clear
young
eyes
of
the
whole
brilliant
and
insurgent
presence
not
that
he
believed
that
it
would
really
go
he
had
a
genial
vision
of
the
hour
of
keith
humiliation
and
return
a
vivid
image
of
keith
crawling
back
on
that
empty
belly
at
that
moment
keith
smiled
a
smile
that
had
in
it
all
the
sweetness
of
his
youth
it
softened
his
father
mood
though
it
could
not
change
it
i
afraid
i
ca
afford
to
pay
your
price
my
boy
he
was
the
first
to
turn
away
and
keith
understood
too
thoroughly
to
condemn
that
was
it
his
father
could
pay
his
price
the
question
was
could
he
afford
to
pay
it
himself
as
the
great
swinging
doors
closed
behind
him
he
realized
that
whatever
price
he
had
paid
for
it
he
had
redeemed
his
soul
and
he
had
bought
his
liberty
chapter
xxxv
really
as
miss
harden
solicitor
pointed
out
to
her
in
the
presence
of
miss
palliser
things
looked
very
black
against
the
young
man
it
was
clear
from
the
letter
schofield
had
received
from
jewdwine
that
morning
that
the
library
was
worth
at
least
three
times
the
amount
these
rickmans
had
paid
for
it
barring
the
fact
that
sale
by
private
contract
was
irregular
and
unsatisfactory
he
completely
exonerated
pilkington
from
all
blame
in
the
matter
his
valuation
had
evidently
been
made
in
all
good
faith
if
in
some
ignorance
but
the
young
man
who
by
pilkington
account
had
been
acting
all
along
as
his
father
agent
must
have
been
perfectly
aware
of
the
nature
of
the
bargain
he
had
made
there
was
every
reason
to
suppose
that
he
had
known
all
about
the
bill
of
sale
before
he
came
down
to
harmouth
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
he
had
made
use
of
his
very
exceptional
opportunities
to
inform
himself
precisely
of
the
value
of
the
books
he
was
cataloguing
he
must
have
known
that
they
had
been
undervalued
by
pilkington
and
seen
his
chance
of
buying
them
for
a
mere
song
so
what
does
he
do
he
carefully
conceals
his
knowledge
from
the
persons
most
concerned
obviously
that
he
and
his
father
may
keep
the
market
to
themselves
then
at
the
last
moment
he
comes
and
pretends
to
give
miss
harden
a
chance
of
forestalling
the
purchase
knowing
well
that
before
she
can
take
a
single
step
the
purchase
will
be
concluded
then
he
hurries
up
to
town
and
the
next
thing
you
hear
is
that
very
sorry
but
arrangements
have
unfortunately
already
been
made
with
pilkington
no
doubt
as
agent
of
the
sale
that
young
man
would
pocket
a
very
substantial
commission
clearly
in
the
face
of
the
evidence
it
was
impossible
to
acquit
him
of
dishonesty
but
no
action
could
be
brought
against
him
because
the
matter
lay
entirely
between
him
and
pilkington
lucia
and
kitty
had
listened
attentively
to
the
masterly
analysis
of
rickman
motives
and
at
the
end
kitty
admitted
that
appearances
were
certainly
against
him
while
lucia
protested
that
he
was
a
poet
and
therefore
constitutionally
incapable
of
the
peculiar
sort
of
cleverness
imputed
to
him
the
man
of
law
submitted
that
because
he
was
a
poet
it
did
not
follow
that
he
was
not
an
uncommonly
knowing
young
man
too
whereupon
kitty
pointed
out
one
or
two
flaws
in
the
legal
argument
in
the
first
place
urged
kitty
the
one
thing
that
this
knowing
young
man
did
not
know
was
the
amount
of
security
the
library
represented
schofield
smiled
in
genial
forbearance
with
a
lady
ignorance
he
have
known
for
such
information
is
always
published
for
the
benefit
of
all
whom
it
may
concern
but
kitty
went
on
triumphantly
there
was
nothing
to
prove
it
nothing
to
show
that
this
knowing
young
man
knew
all
the
facts
when
he
first
undertook
to
work
for
miss
harden
so
far
from
concealing
the
facts
later
on
he
had
to
her
certain
knowledge
written
at
once
to
jewdwine
advising
him
to
buy
in
the
library
literally
over
old
rickman
head
that
old
rickman
action
had
not
followed
on
young
rickman
visit
to
town
was
sufficiently
proved
by
the
dates
the
letter
to
pilkington
enclosing
the
cheque
for
twelve
hundred
had
been
written
and
posted
at
least
twelve
hours
before
his
arrival
what
the
evidence
did
prove
was
that
he
had
moved
heaven
and
earth
to
make
his
father
withdraw
from
his
bargain
schofield
coldly
replied
that
the
better
half
of
miss
arguments
rested
on
the
statements
of
the
young
man
himself
to
which
he
was
hardly
inclined
to
attach
so
much
importance
as
she
did
if
his
main
assertion
was
correct
that
he
had
written
to
inform
jewdwine
of
the
facts
it
was
a
little
odd
to
say
the
least
of
it
that
jewdwine
made
no
mention
of
having
received
that
letter
and
that
he
had
received
it
might
be
fairly
inferred
from
the
discrepancy
between
young
rickman
exaggerated
account
of
the
value
and
jewdwine
more
moderate
estimate
lucia
and
kitty
first
looked
at
each
other
and
then
away
to
opposite
corners
of
the
room
and
at
that
moment
kitty
was
certain
while
lucia
doubted
for
kitty
went
by
the
logic
of
the
evidence
and
lucia
by
the
intuition
which
was
one
with
her
desire
surely
it
was
more
likely
that
rickman
had
never
written
to
horace
than
that
horace
should
have
failed
her
if
he
knew
meanwhile
the
cold
legal
voice
went
on
to
shatter
the
last
point
in
kitty
defence
observing
that
if
rickman
had
not
had
time
to
get
up
to
town
before
his
father
wrote
to
pilkington
he
had
had
plenty
of
time
to
telegraph
he
added
that
the
young
man
moral
character
need
not
concern
them
now
whatever
might
be
thought
of
his
conduct
it
was
not
actionable
and
to
the
legal
mind
what
was
not
actionable
was
irrelevant
but
for
lucia
to
whom
at
the
moment
material
things
were
unrealities
the
burning
question
was
the
honesty
or
dishonesty
of
rickman
for
it
involved
the
loyalty
or
disloyalty
or
rather
the
ardour
or
the
indifference
of
horace
if
rickman
were
cleared
of
the
grosser
guilt
her
cousin
was
on
a
certain
minor
count
condemned
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
which
of
the
two
she
was
the
more
anxious
to
acquit
i
suppose
you
see
him
if
he
calls
asked
kitty
when
they
were
alone

who
savage
keith
rickman
even
in
the
midst
of
their
misery
kitty
could
not
forbear
a
smile
but
for
once
lucia
was
inaccessible
to
the
humour
of
the
name
of
course
i
shall
see
him

said
gravely
chapter
xxxvi
he
called
soon
after
six
that
evening
coming
straight
from
the
station
to
the
house
miss
palliser
was
in
the
library
but
his
face
as
he
entered
bore
such
unmistakable
signs
of
emotion
that
kitty
in
the
kindness
of
her
heart
withdrew
he
was
alone
there
as
he
had
been
on
that
evening
of
his
first
coming
he
looked
round
at
the
place
he
had
loved
so
well
and
knew
that
he
was
looking
at
it
now
for
the
last
time
at
his
feet
the
long
shadow
from
the
bust
of
sophocles
lay
dusk
upon
the
dull
crimson
the
level
light
from
the
west
streamed
over
the
bookshelves
lying
softly
on
brown
russia
leather
and
vellum
lighting
up
the
delicate
gold
of
the
tooling
glowing
in
the
splashes
of
the
lettering
pieces
it
fell
on
the
black
chimney
piece
chiselling
afresh
the
harden
motto
there
was
nothing
meretricious
nothing
flagrantly
modern
there
as
in
that
place
of
books
he
had
just
left
its
bloom
was
the
bloom
of
time
the
beauty
of
a
world
already
passing
away
yet
how
he
had
loved
it
how
he
had
given
himself
up
to
it
how
it
had
soothed
him
with
its
suggestion
of
immortal
things
and
now
for
this
last
time
he
felt
himself
surrounded
by
intelligences
influences
above
the
voices
of
his
anguish
and
his
shame
he
heard
the
stately
generations
calling
they
approved
they
upheld
him
in
his
resolution
he
turned
and
saw
lucia
standing
beside
him
she
had
come
in
unheard
as
on
that
evening
which
seemed
now
so
long
ago
she
held
out
her
hand
not
to
have
shaken
hands
with
the
poor
fellow
would
she
felt
have
been
to
condemn
him
without
a
hearing
he
did
not
see
the
offered
hand
nor
yet
the
chair
it
signed
to
him
to
take
as
if
he
knew
that
he
was
on
his
trial
he
stood
rigidly
before
her
his
eyes
alone
approached
her
looking
to
hers
to
see
if
they
condemned
him
lucia
eyes
were
strictly
they
too
seemed
to
stand
still
to
wait
wide
and
expectant
for
his
defence
her
attitude
was
so
far
judicial
that
she
was
not
going
to
help
him
by
a
leading
question
she
merely
relieved
the
torture
of
his
visible
bodily
constraint
by
inviting
him
to
sit
down
he
dropped
into
a
chair
that
stood
obliquely
by
the
window
and
screwed
himself
round
in
it
so
as
to
face
her
i
saw
my
father
this
morning
he
began
i
went
up
by
the
early
train
i
know
then
you
know
by
this
time
that
i
was
a
day
too
late
pilkington
sent
me
your
father
letter
what
did
you
think
of
it
the
question
so
cool
so
sudden
so
direct
was
not
what
she
felt
she
had
a
right
to
expect
from
him
well
what
did
you
think
of
it
yourself
she
looked
at
him
and
saw
that
she
had
said
a
cruel
thing
ca
you
imagine
what
i
think
of
it
this
again
was
too
sudden
it
took
her
at
a
disadvantage
compelling
her
instantly
to
commit
herself
to
a
theory
of
innocence
or
complicity
if
you
ca
said
he
of
course
there
no
more
to
be
said
he
said
it
very
simply
as
if
he
were
not
in
the
least
offended
and
she
looked
at
him
again
no
there
was
no
wounded
dignity
about
him
there
was
the
tragic
irremediable
misery
of
a
man
condemned
unheard
and
could
that
be
her
doing
lucia
she
who
used
to
be
so
kind
and
just
never
in
all
her
life
had
she
condemned
anybody
unheard
but
she
had
to
choose
between
this
man
who
a
month
ago
was
an
utter
stranger
to
her
and
horace
who
was
of
her
own
blood
her
own
class
her
own
life
did
she
really
want
rickman
to
be
tainted
that
horace
might
be
clean
and
she
knew
he
trusted
her
he
had
made
his
appeal
to
the
spirit
that
had
once
divined
him
he
might
well
say
could
she
not
imagine
what
he
thought
of
it
yes
she
said
gently
i
think
i
can
if
you
had
not
told
me
what
the
library
was
worth
of
course
i
should
have
thought
your
father
very
generous
in
giving
as
much
for
it
as
he
has
done
i
did
tell
you
i
was
anxious
he
we
should
not
buy
it
because
i
knew
we
could
give
you
a
proper
price
yes
you
told
me
and
i
wanted
you
to
buy
it
because
i
thought
you
would
do
your
best
for
me
i
know
i
know
if
it
was
for
that
but
that
the
horrible
part
of
it
why
you
did
your
best
did
you
not
yes
i
really
thought
it
would
be
all
right
if
i
went
up
and
saw
him
i
felt
certain
he
would
see
it
as
i
did
well
he
answered
with
painful
hesitation
well
he
did
see
it
my
father
has
very
much
imagination
he
could
realize
the
thing
in
the
same
way
because
he
was
in
it
as
i
was
he
seen
nobody
but
pilkington
you
see
something
in
her
face
told
him
that
this
line
of
defence
was
distasteful
to
her
that
he
had
no
right
to
make
a
personal
matter
of
an
abstract
question
of
justice
it
was
through
those
personalities
that
he
had
always
erred
i
do
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
it
she
said
he
he
thought
it
was
only
a
question
of
a
bargain
between
pilkington
and
him
what
you
mean
is
that
he
would
admit
that
i
came
into
it
at
all
she
saw
that
she
was
putting
him
to
the
torture
he
could
not
defend
himself
without
exposing
his
father
but
she
meant
that
he
should
defend
himself
that
he
should
if
possible
stand
clear
yes
he
had
seen
you
he
would
go
back
on
his
bargain
and
i
could
make
him
god
knows
i
tried
hard
enough
did
you
think
you
could
do
anything
by
trying
i
thought
i
could
do
a
good
deal
i
had
a
hold
on
him
you
see
i
happen
to
be
extremely
useful
to
him
in
this
branch
of
his
business
i
was
trained
for
it
in
fact
i
hopelessly
mixed
up
with
it
well
he
ca
do
very
much
without
me
and
i
told
him
that
if
he
did
give
up
the
library
i
should
give
him
up
it
was
a
nice
thing
to
have
to
say
to
your
father
and
you
said
it
her
face
expressed
both
admiration
and
a
certain
horror
yes
i
told
him
he
must
choose
between
me
and
his
bargain
that
must
have
been
hard
he
did
seem
to
find
it
so
anyhow
he
has
chosen
me
i
meant
hard
for
you
to
have
to
say
it
i
assure
you
it
came
uncommonly
easy
at
the
moment
do
do
i
not
going
to
defend
him
simply
because
he
happens
to
be
my
father
i
do
even
defend
myself
you
you
did
know
i
knew
quite
enough
i
knew
he
might
cheat
you
without
meaning
to
i
did
think
he
do
it
so
soon
or
so
infamously
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
went
up
to
town
on
purpose
to
prevent
it
i
know
i
know
that
was
what
you
went
for
she
seemed
to
be
answering
some
incessant
voice
that
accused
him
and
he
perceived
that
the
precipitancy
of
his
action
suggested
a
very
different
interpretation
his
position
was
odious
enough
in
all
conscience
but
as
yet
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
he
could
be
suspected
of
complicity
in
the
actual
fraud
why
did
i
do
something
to
prevent
it
before
but
did
you
i
did
everything
i
could
i
wrote
to
my
father
if
that
anything
the
result
as
you
see
was
a
cheque
for
the
two
hundred
that
should
have
been
three
thousand
did
it
never
occur
to
you
to
write
to
anybody
else
to
jewdwine
for
instance
she
brought
out
the
question
shrinkingly
as
if
urged
against
her
will
by
some
intolerable
compulsion
and
he
judged
that
this
time
they
had
touched
what
was
for
her
a
vital
point
of
course
it
occurred
to
me
have
you
heard
from
him
i
have
but
hardly
in
time
for
him
to
do
anything
he
reflected
jewdwine
had
written
therefore
his
intentions
had
been
good
but
he
had
delayed
considerably
in
writing
evidently
then
he
had
been
embarrassed
he
had
not
mentioned
that
he
had
heard
from
him
and
why
should
he
have
mentioned
it
oh
well
after
all
why
should
he
at
the
back
of
his
mind
there
had
crawled
a
wriggling
suspicion
of
jewdwine
he
saw
it
wriggling
and
stamped
on
it
instantly
there
were
signs
of
acute
anxiety
on
miss
harden
face
it
was
as
if
she
implored
him
to
say
something
consoling
about
jewdwine
something
that
would
make
him
pure
in
her
troubled
sight
a
light
dawned
on
him
did
you
write
to
him
she
asked
he
saw
what
she
wanted
him
to
say
and
he
said
it
yes
i
wrote
but
i
suppose
i
did
it
too
late
like
everything
else
i
done
he
had
told
the
truth
but
not
the
whole
truth
which
would
have
been
damaging
to
jewdwine
to
deny
altogether
that
he
had
written
would
have
been
a
clumsy
and
unnecessary
falsehood
easily
detected
something
more
masterly
was
required
of
him
and
he
achieved
it
without
an
instant
hesitation
and
with
his
eyes
open
to
the
consequences
he
knew
that
he
was
deliberately
suppressing
the
one
detail
that
proved
his
own
innocence
but
as
their
eyes
met
he
saw
that
she
knew
it
too
that
she
divined
him
through
the
web
that
wrapped
him
round
well
she
said
if
you
wrote
to
jewdwine
you
did
indeed
do
your
best
the
answer
on
her
part
was
no
less
masterly
in
its
way
he
could
not
help
admiring
its
significant
ambiguity
it
was
both
an
act
of
justice
an
assurance
of
her
belief
in
him
and
a
superb
intimation
of
her
trust
in
horace
jewdwine
and
it
was
not
only
superb
it
was
almost
humble
in
that
which
it
further
confessed
and
implied
her
gratitude
to
him
for
having
made
that
act
of
justice
consistent
with
loyalty
to
her
cousin
how
clever
of
her
to
pack
so
many
meanings
into
one
little
phrase
i
did
it
too
late
he
said
emphasizing
the
point
which
served
for
jewdwine
vindication
never
mind
that
you
did
it
miss
harden
is
it
possible
that
you
still
believe
in
me
the
question
was
wrung
from
him
for
her
belief
in
him
remained
incredible
why
should
it
not
be
possible
any
man
of
business
would
tell
you
that
appearances
are
against
me
well
i
do
believe
in
appearances
and
i
do
believe
in
you
you
are
not
a
man
of
business
you
see
thank
goodness
i
not
now
you
never
were
i
think
no
and
yet
i
so
horribly
mixed
up
with
this
business
that
i
can
never
think
of
myself
as
an
honest
man
again
she
seemed
to
be
considering
whether
this
outburst
was
genuine
or
only
part
of
his
sublime
pretence
and
i
could
never
think
of
you
as
anything
else
i
should
say
from
all
i
have
seen
of
you
that
you
are
if
anything
honest
too
painfully
sincere
yes
yes
her
heart
cried
out
i
believe
in
him
he
did
tell
the
truth
about
that
letter
to
horace
she
could
have
loved
him
for
that
lie
he
was
now
at
liberty
to
part
with
her
on
that
understanding
leaving
her
to
think
him
all
that
was
disinterested
and
honourable
and
fine
but
he
could
not
do
it
not
in
the
face
of
her
almost
impassioned
declaration
of
belief
at
that
moment
he
was
ready
rather
to
fall
at
her
feet
in
the
torture
of
his
shame
and
as
he
looked
at
her
tears
came
into
his
eyes
those
tears
that
cut
through
the
flesh
like
knives
that
are
painful
to
bring
forth
and
terrible
to
see
i
not
been
an
honest
man
though
i
no
right
to
let
you
believe
in
me
her
face
was
sweeter
than
ever
with
its
piteous
pathetic
smile
struggling
through
the
white
eclipse
of
grief
what
have
you
done
it
not
what
i
done
it
what
i
did
do
i
told
you
that
i
knew
the
library
was
going
to
be
sold
i
told
you
that
yesterday
and
you
naturally
thought
i
only
it
yesterday
did
you
well
yes
but
i
do
see
she
paused
and
his
confession
dropped
into
the
silence
with
an
awful
weight
i
knew
all
the
time
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
the
change
of
bodily
posture
emphasizing
the
spiritual
recoil
all
the
time
and
you
never
told
me
all
the
time
and
i
never
told
you
i
forgotten
when
you
offered
me
that
secretaryship
but
i
knew
it
when
i
let
you
engage
me
i
knew
it
before
i
came
down
i
never
would
have
come
if
i
realized
what
it
meant
but
when
i
did
know
i
stayed
all
the
same
what
do
you
think
you
ought
to
have
done
of
course
i
ought
to
have
gone
away
since
i
could
be
honest
and
tell
you
and
why
she
said
it
very
gently
but
with
no
change
in
her
attitude
why
could
you
be
honest
and
tell
me
i
not
sure
that
i
any
right
to
tell
you
what
i
had
any
right
to
know
i
only
sure
of
one
thing
as
i
did
know
i
ought
to
have
stayed
but
he
reiterated
sorrowfully
i
did
stay
you
stayed
to
help
me
yes
with
all
my
dishonesty
i
would
have
done
it
if
i
had
made
myself
believe
that
as
it
turned
out
i
helped
to
ruin
you
please
please
do
as
far
as
i
concerned
you
nothing
to
reproach
yourself
with
your
position
was
a
very
difficult
one
i
ought
never
to
have
got
into
it
still
you
did
your
best
my
best
you
ca
say
i
did
what
an
honourable
man
would
have
done
i
mean
at
the
beginning
no
no
i
afraid
i
ca
say
that
he
did
not
expect
anything
but
sincerity
from
her
neither
did
he
desire
that
her
sense
of
honour
should
be
less
fine
than
his
but
he
longed
for
some
word
of
absolution
some
look
even
that
should
reinstate
him
in
his
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
none
you
ca
think
worse
of
me
than
i
think
myself
he
said
and
turned
mournfully
away
she
sat
suddenly
upright
with
one
hand
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
as
if
ready
to
rise
and
cut
off
his
retreat
wait
she
said
have
you
any
idea
what
you
are
going
to
do
the
question
held
him
within
a
foot
length
of
her
chair
where
the
light
fell
full
on
his
face
i
only
know
i
not
going
back
to
the
shop
you
were
in
earnest
then
it
really
has
come
to
that
it
could
very
well
come
to
anything
else
she
looked
up
at
him
gravely
realizing
for
the
first
time
through
her
own
sorrow
the
precise
nature
and
the
consequences
of
his
action
he
had
burnt
his
ships
parted
with
his
means
of
livelihood
in
a
quixotic
endeavour
to
serve
her
interests
and
redeem
his
own
honour
forgive
my
asking
but
for
the
present
this
leaves
you
stranded
it
leaves
me
free
she
rose
i
know
what
that
means
you
wo
mind
my
paying
my
debts
at
once
instead
of
later
he
stared
stupidly
as
if
her
words
had
stunned
him
she
was
seated
at
her
writing
table
and
had
begun
filling
in
a
cheque
before
he
completely
grasped
the
horrible
significance
of
what
she
had
said
what
are
you
doing
he
asked
i
writing
thirty
instead
of
fifteen
because
that
is
what
you
ought
to
have
asked
for
in
the
beginning
you
see
i
am
more
now
than
i
was
then
he
smiled
and
do
you
really
suppose
i
am
going
to
take
it
he
meant
his
smile
to
be
bitter
but
somehow
it
was
not
after
all
she
was
so
helpless
and
so
young
of
course
you
are
going
to
take
it
i
need
ask
what
you
think
of
me
this
time
the
smile
was
bitterness
itself
but
it
yours
what
i
owe
you
i
only
paying
it
instead
of
some
other
day
but
you
have
not
got
to
pay
me
anything
what
do
you
think
paying
me
for
for
your
work
for
the
catalogue
of
course
that
infamous
catalogue
ought
never
to
have
been
made
not
by
me
at
any
rate
but
you
made
it
you
made
it
for
me
i
ordered
it
you
ordered
it
from
my
father
in
ordinary
circumstances
you
would
have
owed
him
fifteen
pounds
but
even
he
would
take
it
now
i
think
he
considers
himself
quite
sufficiently
paid
you
are
mixing
up
two
things
that
are
absolutely
distinct
no
i
only
refusing
to
be
mixed
up
with
them
but
you
are
mixed
up
with
them
he
laughed
at
that
shot
as
a
brave
man
laughs
at
a
hurt
you
need
remind
me
of
that
i
meant
any
more
than
i
can
help
though
it
may
seem
to
you
that
i
have
very
much
lower
to
sink
believe
me
i
do
associate
you
with
this
wretched
business
i
want
you
to
forget
it
i
ca
forget
it
if
i
could
it
would
only
be
by
refusing
to
degrade
myself
further
in
connection
with
it
his
words
were
clumsy
and
wild
as
the
hasty
terrified
movements
of
a
naked
soul
trying
to
gather
round
it
the
last
rags
of
decency
and
honour
there
is
no
connection
she
added
more
gently
than
ever
seeing
how
she
hurt
him
do
you
see
that
it
lies
between
you
and
me
he
saw
that
as
she
spoke
she
was
curling
the
cheque
into
a
convenient
form
for
slipping
into
his
hand
in
the
moment
of
indeed
indeed
you
must
she
whispered
he
drew
back
sharply
miss
harden
wo
you
leave
me
a
shred
of
and
what
about
mine
said
she
it
was
too
much
even
for
chivalry
to
bear
that
not
exactly
my
affair
is
it
he
hardly
realised
the
full
significance
of
his
answer
but
he
deemed
it
apt
if
as
she
had
been
so
careful
to
point
out
to
him
her
honour
and
his
moved
on
different
planes
how
could
her
be
his
affair
it
ought
to
be
she
murmured
in
a
tone
whose
sweetness
should
have
been
a
salve
to
any
wound
but
he
did
not
perceive
its
meaning
any
more
than
he
had
perceived
his
own
being
still
blinded
by
what
seemed
to
him
the
cruelty
and
degradation
of
the
final
blow
she
had
stripped
him
then
she
stabbed
to
hide
his
shame
and
his
hurt
he
turned
his
face
from
her
and
left
her
so
strangely
and
so
drunkenly
did
he
go
with
such
a
mist
in
his
eyes
and
such
anguish
and
fury
in
his
heart
and
brain
that
on
the
threshold
of
the
harden
library
he
stumbled
past
miss
palliser
without
seeing
her
she
found
lucia
standing
where
he
had
left
her
looking
at
a
little
roll
of
pale
green
paper
that
her

curled

downey
was
the
light
of
tavistock
place
bloomsbury
in
the
brown
monotony
of
the
street
it
stood
out
splendid
conspicuous
its
door
and
half
its
front
were
painted
a
beautiful
a
remarkable
while
its
door
knob
and
were
of
polished
brass
downey
knew
nothing
of
concealment
or
disguise
every
evening
at
the
hour
of
seven
through
its
window
it
offered
to
the
world
a
scene
of
stupefying
brilliance
the
blinds
were
up
the
curtains
revealing
the
allurements
of
the
interior
from
both
sides
of
the
street
the
entire
length
of
the
was
visible
above
it
a
handsome
gilt
gaselier
spread
out
its
branches
and
on
this
gaselier
as
many
as
three
burned
furiously
at
once
in
the
intense
illumination
the
faces
of
the
boarders
could
be
distinctly
seen
they
sat
as
it
were
transfigured
in
a
nebulous
whorl
or
glory
of
yellow
light
it
fell
on
the
high
collars
the
quite
remarkably
high
collars
of
the
young
gentlemen
and
on
those
gay
those
positively
hilarious
blouses
which
the
young
ladies
at
downey
wear
beside
the
and
tumblers
of
red
glass
it
lay
like
a
rosy
shadow
on
the
cloth
it
gave
back
their
green
again
to
the
aspidistras
that
rising
from
a
ruche
of
pink
paper
formed
the
central
ornament
of
the
table
it
made
a
luminous
body
of
downey
face
the
graver
values
were
not
sacrificed
to
this
joyous
expenditure
of
for
the
the
design
was
in
chocolate
on
a
ground
of
ochre
sustained
the
note
of
fundamental
melancholy
at
the
back
of
the
apartment
immediately
behind
downey
an
immense
mahogany
sideboard
shone
in
a
gorgeous
gloom
on
the
sideboard
stood
a
family
bible
and
on
the
family
bible
a
a
that
might
have
been
silver
there
was
design
in
this
arrangement
but
for
the
bible
the
would
have
been
obliterated
by
downey
thus
elevated
it
closed
it
crowned
the
vista
with
a
beauty
that
was
final
monumental
and
supreme
you
had
only
to
glance
through
those
windows
to
see
that
combined
the
splendid
publicity
of
an
hotel
with
the
refinements
of
a
home
that
it
offered
together
with
a
luxurious
table
the
society
of
youthful
persons
of
both
sexes
and
if
everything
around
downey
was
on
a
liberal
scale
so
was
downey
herself
she
was
expansive
in
her
person
prodigal
in
sympathy
exuberant
in
dress
if
she
had
one
eye
to
the
main
chance
the
other
smiled
at
you
in
pure
benignity
on
her
round
face
was
a
festal
flush
flooding
and
effacing
the
little
lines
and
wrinkles
which
appeared
on
it
by
day
it
wore
the
colour
of
the
hour
which
evening
after
evening
renewed
for
her
the
great
drama
and
spectacle
of
the
dinner
her
table
was
disposed
with
a
view
to
scenic
effect
it
was
not
by
accident
that
downey
herself
was
seated
at
the
obscure
or
sideboard
end
and
that
she
gathered
round
her
there
the
older
and
less
attractive
members
of
her
circle
this
arrangement
was
flattering
to
them
for
it
constituted
an
order
of
precedence
and
they
were
in
the
seats
of
honour
it
had
also
the
further
advantage
of
giving
prominence
to
the
young
people
whose
brilliant
appearance
of
an
evening
was
as
good
as
an
advertisement
for
downey
first
then
at
the
top
of
the
table
sat
two
elderly
ladies
dishevelled
birds
of
passage
guests
of
a
day
and
a
night
next
on
downey
right
came
old
miss
bramble
with
old
partridge
opposite
on
the
left
the
young
gentleman
at
the
extreme
bottom
or
public
end
of
the
table
was
spinks
he
was
almost
blatantly
visible
from
the
street
at
spinks
side
sat
miss
ada
bishop
the
young
lady
in
the
fascinating
pink
blouse
and
opposite
him
miss
flossie
walker
in
the
still
more
fascinating
blue
to
the
left
of
miss
bishop
in
the
very
centre
of
the
table
was
a
commercial
gentleman
soper
not
specially
conspicuous
and
facing
him
and
on
miss
walker
right
came
miss
roots
who
might
be
any
age
you
please
between
thirty
and
forty
between
them
at
the
present
moment
there
was
an
empty
chair
miss
roots
was
the
link
between
the
melancholy
decadence
above
the
aspidistras
and
the
glorious
and
triumphant
youth
below
as
far
as
could
be
inferred
with
any
certainty
she
had
leanings
to
the
side
of
youth
her
presence
was
no
restraint
upon
its
glad
and
frolicsome
humour
it
felt
that
it
could
trust
her
she
had
never
been
known
to
betray
any
of
the
secrets
that
passed
at
the
risk
of
their
lives
from
miss
bishop
side
of
the
table
to
miss
walker
there
was
reason
to
suppose
that
miss
roots
was
aware
of
the
surreptitious
manufacture
of
bread
pellets
by
spinks
spinks
being
the
spirit
of
youth
incarnate
but
when
one
of
these
missiles
struck
miss
roots
full
in
the
throat
when
it
should
have
just
delicately
grazed
the
top
of
miss
flossie
frizzled
hair
miss
roots
not
only
ignored
the
incident
at
the
time
but
never
made
the
faintest
allusion
to
it
afterwards
therefore
spinks
voted
miss
roots
to
be
a
brick
and
a
trump
and
what
he
called
a
real
lady
very
curious
and
interesting
was
the
behaviour
of
these
people
among
themselves
it
was
an
eternal
game
of
chivy
or
each
person
being
by
turn
the
hunter
and
the
hunted
downey
tried
to
talk
to
the
birds
of
passage
but
the
birds
of
passage
would
talk
to
nobody
but
each
other
miss
bramble
took
not
the
slightest
notice
of
partridge
partridge
did
everything
he
could
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
miss
bramble
but
she
was
always
looking
away
over
the
aspidistras
towards
the
young
end
of
the
table
with
a
little
air
of
strained
attention
at
once
alien
and
alert
spinks
spent
himself
in
perpetual
endeavours
to
stimulate
a
sense
of
humour
in
miss
walker
who
had
quite
enough
of
it
with
very
violent
effects
on
miss
bishop
who
had
it
in
excess
while
soper
was
incessantly
trying
to
catch
the
eye
of
miss
roots
around
the
aspidistras
an
enterprise
in
which
he
was
but
rarely
successful
miss
walker
finally
making
no
attempt
to
bridge
over
the
space
between
her
chair
and
miss
roots
that
empty
seat
was
reserved
for
rickman
who
was
generally
late
on
his
arrival
the
blinds
would
be
pulled
down
in
deference
to
his
wish
for
a
more
perfect
privacy
meanwhile
they
remained
up
so
that
wandering
persons
in
hansoms
lonely
persons
having
furnished
apartments
persons
living
expensively
in
hotels
or
miserably
in
other
might
look
in
and
long
to
be
received
into
downey
to
enjoy
the
luxury
the
comfort
the
society
the
society
yes
as
downey
surveyed
her
table
and
its
guests
her
imagination
ignored
the
base
commercial
tie
she
felt
herself
to
be
a
social
power
having
called
into
existence
an
assembly
so
various
so
brilliant
and
so
gay
one
thing
only
interfered
with
downey
happiness
rickman
habit
of
being
late
such
a
habit
would
not
have
mattered
so
much
in
any
of
the
other
boarders
because
remarkable
as
they
were
collectively
individually
downey
seldom
thought
of
them
unless
they
happened
to
be
there
whereas
with
rickman
now
whether
he
was
there
or
not
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
rickman
was
later
than
ever
i
really
beginning
to
be
afraid
said
downey
that
he
be
coming
the
gentleman
soper
was
heard
muttering
something
to
the
effect
that
he
thought
they
could
bear
up
if
he
did
come
whereupon
downey
begged
soper
pardon
in
a
manner
which
was
a
challenge
to
him
to
repeat
his
last
remark
therefore
he
repeated
it
i
say
i
we
can
manage
to
bear
up
speak
for
yourself
mr
soper
this
from
spinks
who
adored
rickman
well
really
i
ca
think
how
it
is
you
and
he
do
seem
to
hit
it
off
together
a
young
fellow
that
can
make
himself
so
pleasant
when
he
likes
when
he
likes
and
when
he
does
like
when
he
comes
into
the
room
like
a
young
lord
with
his
head
in
the
air
and
plumps
himself
down
straight
in
front
of
you
and
looks
at
you
as
if
you
were
a
sorter
or
a
centerpede
call
that
pleasant
spinks
chuckled
behind
his
table
napkin
he
means
a
centre
piece
would
he
make
a
handsome
one
soper
combined
a
certain
stateliness
of
carriage
with
a
restless
insignificance
of
feature
we
all
know
said
downey
that
rickman
is
a
very
reserved
gentleman
he
has
his
own
thoughts
thoughts
i
got
my
thoughts
but
they
do
make
me
disagreeable
to
everybody
spinks
craned
forward
as
far
as
the
height
of
his
collar
permitted
him
i
would
be
too
if
i
were
you
mr
soper
the
young
end
of
the
table
heaved
and
quivered
with
primeval
mirth
even
flossie
walker
was
moved
to
a
faint
smile
for
soper
though
outwardly
taciturn
and
morose
was
possessed
inwardly
by
a
perfect
fury
of
sociability
an
immortal
and
insatiable
craving
to
converse
it
was
an
instinct
which
if
gratified
would
have
undermined
the
whole
fabric
of
the
dinner
being
essentially
egoistic
destructive
and
malign
soper
resented
the
rapidity
with
which
rickman
had
been
accepted
by
the
he
himself
after
two
residence
only
maintaining
a
precarious
popularity
by
little
offerings
of
to
the
ladies
hence
the
bitterness
of
his
present
mood
there
are
thoughts
thoughts
said
downey
severely
for
the
commercial
gentleman
had
touched
her
in
a
very
sensitive
place
and
when
rickman
is
in
wot
i
call
vein
there
nobody
like
him
for
making
a
dinner
go
off
here
soper
achieved
a
sardonic
a
really
sardonic
smile
oh
of
course
if
you
eludin
to
the
young
gentleman
appetite
but
this
was
insufferable
it
was
wounding
downey
in
the
tenderest
spot
of
all
the
rose
of
her
face
became
a
peony
i
doing
no
such
thing
if
any
gentleman
wishes
to
pay
me
a
compliment
her
gay
smile
took
for
granted
that
no
gentleman
could
be
so
barbarous
as
not
to
feel
that
wish
let
him
show
an
appetite
as
for
the
ladies
i
wish
they
had
an
appetite
to
show
partridge
let
me
give
you
a
little
more
canary
pudding
it
as
light
as
light
no
oh
come
mr
partridge
partridge
gesture
of
refusal
was
so
vast
so
expressive
that
it
amounted
to
a
solemn
personal
revelation
which
implied
not
so
much
that
partridge
rejected
canary
pudding
as
that
he
renounced
pleasure
of
which
canary
pudding
was
but
the
symbol
and
the
sign
spinks
then
he
let
me
give
him
another
slice
know
you
bet
tell
you
wot
it
is
downey
the
canary
that
pudding
was
made
of
must
have
been
an
uncommonly
fine
bird
there
was
a
swift
step
on
the
pavement
the
determined
click
of
a
and
the
clang
of
a
closing
door
why
here
rickman
said
downey
betraying
the
preoccupation
of
her
soul
rickman
entrance
produced
a
certain
vibration
down
both
sides
of
the
table
a
movement
unanimous
yet
discordant
as
if
the
nerves
of
this
social
body
that
was
downey
were
being
played
upon
every
way
at
once
each
boarder
seemed
to
be
preparing
for
an
experience
that
whether
agreeable
or
otherwise
would
be
disturbing
to
the
last
degree
the
birds
of
passage
raised
their
heads
with
a
faint
flutter
miss
walker
contemplated
a
with
a
dreamy
air
soper
strove
vainly
to
fix
himself
in
an
attitude
of
dignified
detachment
the
was
about
to
suffer
the
tremendous
invasion
of
a
foreign
element
for
a
moment
it
was
united
downey
face
revealed
a
grave
anxiety
she
was
evidently
asking
herself
was
he
or
was
he
not
in
his
vein
a
glance
at
the
object
of
his
adoration
decided
the
question
for
spinks
rickman
was
thank
goodness
in
his
vein
in
which
state
he
was
incomprehensible
to
anybody
but
miss
roots
he
was
in
that
comparatively
commonplace
condition
which
rendered
him
accessible
to
spinks
ladies
and
gentlemen
allow
me
to
introduce
my
friend
the
lyte
ryzors
jemima
show
the
deceased
gentleman
to
his
chair
miss
walker
ryzors
he
is
really
to
myke
your
acquaintance
miss
walker
though
at
first
sight
he
may
not
appear
so
wot
you
might
be
apt
to
mistyke
for
coldness
is
merely
intense
reserve
oh
dry
up
spinks
no
rickman
was
certainly
not
in
his
vein
this
evening
he
made
no
apology
whatever
for
his
lateness
he
ignored
the
commercial
gentleman
rickman
as
he
slipped
into
his
place
between
miss
walker
and
miss
roots
he
forgot
his
usual
busy
at
the
museum
miss
roots
a
question
that
recognized
her
as
a
fellow
worker
in
the
fields
of
literature
thus
lightening
the
obscurity
that
hid
her
labours
there
and
for
miss
flossie
timid
greeting
the
lifting
of
her
upper
lip
that
just
showed
two
dear
little
white
teeth
he
gave
back
a
reluctant
and
embarrassed
smile
he
used
to
like
sitting
by
flossie
because
she
was
so
pretty
and
so
plump
he
used
to
be
sorry
for
her
because
she
worked
so
hard
and
though
plump
was
so
pathetically
anaemic
and
so
shy
critically
considered
her
body
in
spite
of
its
plumpness
was
a
little
too
small
for
her
head
and
her
features
were
a
little
too
small
for
her
face
but
then
they
were
so
very
correct
as
correct
as
her
demeanour
and
the
way
she
did
her
hair
she
had
clusters
and
curls
and
loops
and
coils
of
hair
black
as
her
eyes
which
were
so
black
that
he
could
tell
the
iris
from
the
pupil
not
that
flossie
had
ever
let
him
try
and
now
he
had
forgotten
whether
they
were
black
or
blue
forgotten
everything
about
them
and
her
flossie
might
be
as
correct
as
flossie
pleased
she
simply
did
matter
when
she
saw
him
smile
she
turned
up
her
eyes
to
the
again
the
little
clerk
brought
with
her
from
the
city
an
air
of
incorruptible
propriety
assumed
for
purposes
of
and
at
variance
with
her
style
of
and
the
blueness
and
gaiety
of
her
blouse
with
all
that
it
implied
and
took
for
granted
it
used
to
strike
him
as
pathetic
but
now
he
did
find
flossie
in
the
least
pathetic
he
was
waiting
for
the
question
which
was
bound
to
come
it
came
from
spinks
and
in
a
form
more
horrible
than
any
that
he
had
imagined
i
say
rickets
wot
did
you
want
all
those
shirts
for
down
in
devonshire
instead
of
replying
rickets
blew
his
nose
making
his
conceal
as
much
of
his
face
as
possible
at
that
moment
he
caught
miss
bishop
staring
at
him
and
if
there
was
one
thing
that
rickman
disliked
more
than
another
it
was
being
stared
at
particularly
by
miss
bishop
miss
bishop
had
red
hair
a
loose
vivacious
mouth
and
her
stare
was
grossly
interrogative
flossie
sent
out
a
little
winged
look
at
him
like
a
soft
dark
butterfly
it
skimmed
and
hovered
about
him
and
flitted
too
ethereal
to
alight
miss
bishop
however
had
no
scruples
and
put
it
to
him
point
blank
devonshire
said
miss
bishop
what
were
you
doing
down
there
she
planted
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
propped
her
chin
on
her
her
stare
thus
tilted
was
partly
covered
by
her
eyelids
if
you
really
want
said
spinks
to
see
that
gentleman
opposite
you
have
to
take
a
telescope
the
adoring
youth
conceived
that
it
had
been
given
to
him
alone
of
the
boarders
to
penetrate
the
mind
of
rickman
that
he
was
the
guardian
of
his
mood
whose
mission
it
was
to
protect
him
from
the
impertinent
approaches
of
the
rest
a
telescope
wot
mean
do
you
think
he
got
a
sort
of
a
look
especially
about
the
mouth
and
nose
whether
it
was
from
being
stared
at
or
for
some
other
reason
but
by
this
time
rickman
had
certainly
become
a
little
distant
he
was
not
getting
on
well
with
anybody
or
anything
not
even
with
downey
excellent
dinner
nor
yet
with
the
claret
an
extra
ordered
for
his
private
drinking
always
to
downey
secret
trepidation
she
gave
a
look
at
him
and
signalled
to
her
ladies
to
withdraw
she
herself
remained
behind
superintending
the
removal
of
the
feast
keeping
a
motherly
eye
too
on
the
poor
boy
and
his
claret
ever
since
that
one
dreadful
sunday
morning
when
she
had
found
him
asleep
in
full
evening
dress
upon
his
bedroom
floor
downey
was
always
expecting
to
see
him
drop
under
the
table
he
had
never
done
it
yet
but
there
was
no
knowing
when
he
might
whatever
the
extent
of
rickman
alleged
intemperance
his
was
not
the
vice
of
the
solitary
drinker
and
the
claret
was
nearly
all
drunk
by
spinks
and
soper
it
had
the
effect
of
waking
in
the
commercial
gentleman
the
demon
of
sociability
that
slept
what
soper
wanted
to
know
was
whether
rickman
could
recommend
as
a
holiday
resort
could
he
tell
him
of
any
commercial
hotel
or
down
there
to
which
rickman
replied
that
he
really
could
tell
him
anything
at
all
perhaps
said
downey
peering
over
the
edge
of
the
she
was
helping
to
fold
perhaps
he
has
his
reasons
the
claret
had
made
soper
not
only
sociable
but
jocose
reasons
that
a
new
name
for
if
he
do
want
more
than
one
at
a
time
i
wish
he
introduce
the
rest
of
to
me
i
daresay
he
would
be
very
happy
if
he
thought
you
would
understand
them
mr
soper
understand
why
i
do
suppose
they
talk
greek
ryzors
said
spinks
indignantly
could
give
points
if
they
did
he
speaks
the
language
soper
replied
that
in
that
case
perhaps
rickman
would
oblige
him
with
the
greek
for
crumby
bits
at
the
moment
rickman
did
not
look
like
obliging
soper
with
anything
the
provocation
was
certainly
immense
soper
voice
inspired
him
with
a
fury
of
disgust
the
muscles
of
his
mouth
twitched
the
blood
rushed
visibly
to
his
forehead
he
stood
looming
over
the
table
like
a
young
pink
downey
and
partridge
retreated
in
some
alarm
soper
however
was
one
of
those
people
who
are
not
roused
but
merely
disconcerted
by
the
spectacle
of
passion
soper
said
he
supposed
he
could
make
a
remark
and
still
thirsting
for
companionship
he
pursued
downey
to
the
as
he
went
he
fingered
his
little
box
of
as
if
it
had
been
a
talisman
or
charm
rickman
poured
himself
out
some
claret
which
he
drank
slowly
with
closed
eyelids
leaning
back
in
his
chair
for
god
sake
spinks
he
muttered
do
speak
to
me
all
right
old
chappy
i
wo
but
he
whispered
i
would
go
off
just
yet
ryzors
if
i
were
you
by
going
off
spinks
meant
departure
in
a
train
of
thought
he
be
back
in
another
minute
he
was
back
already
sociable
elated
smoking
a
cigar
upstairs
with
the
ladies
he
and
his
had
met
with
unprecedented
success
rickman
opened
his
eyes
ever
try
said
soper
a
flor
di
dindigul
one
you
find
the
flavour
very
delicate
and
mild
he
held
it
out
that
flor
di
dindigul
as
an
olive
branch
to
the
tempestuous
young
man
it
was
not
accepted
it
was
not
even
seen
rickman
rose
to
his
feet
to
his
irritated
vision
the
opposite
wall
seemed
to
heave
and
bulge
forward
its
chocolate
design
to
become
distended
and
to
burst
spreading
itself
in
blotches
on
the
yellow
ochre
on
the
face
of
the
hideous
welter
swam
the
face
of
soper
as
it
were
bodiless
and
alone
he
drew
in
his
breath
with
a
slight
shudder
pushed
his
chair
back
from
the
table
and
strode
out
of
the
room
spinks
looked
after
him
sorrowfully
wy
could
you
leave
him
alone
soper
you
might
see
he
did
want
to
talk
how
could
i
see
wot
he
wanted
one
minute
as
chatty
and
sociable
and
the
next
he
up
like
three
dozen
of
bottled
stout
wot
i
you
ca
on
with
any
certainty
that
opinion
was
secretly
shared
by
miss
flossie
walker
chapter
xxxviii
rickman
it
seemed
was
doomed
to
inspire
that
sense
of
agonizing
uncertainty
it
was
the
second
evening
after
his
return
the
dinner
was
not
going
off
well
miss
walker
was
depressed
spinks
was
not
in
his
accustomed
spirits
and
downey
had
been
going
about
with
red
eyes
all
day
rickman
had
confided
to
her
the
deplorable
state
of
his
finances
and
downey
had
said
to
herself
she
had
known
from
the
first
that
he
would
not
be
permanent
he
did
want
to
be
permanent
he
desired
to
vanish
to
disappear
from
the
and
the
boarders
and
from
poppy
grace
on
the
balcony
next
door
to
get
away
from
every
face
and
every
voice
that
he
had
known
before
he
knew
lucia
harden
being
convinced
that
he
would
never
see
her
again
he
wanted
to
be
alone
with
his
vivid
and
piercing
memory
of
her
at
first
it
was
the
pain
that
pierced
she
had
taken
out
her
little
sword
and
stabbed
him
it
would
have
mattered
he
said
if
the
sword
had
been
a
true
little
sword
but
it
was
it
had
snapt
and
left
a
nasty
bit
of
steel
inside
him
her
last
phrase
was
the
touch
that
finished
him
but
the
very
sting
of
it
created
a
healthy
reaction
by
his
revolt
against
that
solitary
instance
of
her
cruelty
he
had
recovered
his
right
to
dwell
upon
her
kindness
he
dwelt
upon
it
until
at
times
he
entered
again
into
possession
of
the
tender
beautiful
dominating
dream
so
intense
was
his
hallucination
that
as
he
walked
alone
in
any
southerly
direction
he
still
felt
muttersmoor
on
his
right
hand
and
harcombe
on
his
left
and
he
had
waked
in
the
morning
to
the
sound
of
the
sea
beating
upon
harmouth
beach
but
these
feelings
visited
him
more
rarely
in
the
than
elsewhere
that
was
why
he
wanted
to
get
away
from
it
the
illusion
was
destroyed
by
these
irrelevant
persons
of
the
not
that
he
noticed
them
much
but
when
he
did
it
was
to
discover
in
them
some
quality
that
he
had
not
observed
before
he
found
imbecility
in
the
manners
of
spinks
coarseness
and
violence
in
the
figures
of
downey
and
miss
bishop
insipidity
in
the
whole
person
of
miss
flossie
walker
and
now
as
he
looked
round
the
table
he
wondered
how
it
was
he
ever
came
there
after
living
for
four
weeks
with
lucia
harden
or
the
thought
of
her
he
had
a
positive
difficulty
in
recognizing
even
spinks
and
flossie
as
people
he
had
once
intimately
known
miss
roots
alone
for
some
inscrutable
reason
seemed
familiar
in
keeping
with
that
divine
experience
to
which
the
actual
hour
did
violence
it
was
almost
as
if
she
understood
a
shrewdly
sympathetic
glance
went
out
from
a
pair
of
hazel
eyes
set
in
a
plain
clever
strenuous
face
miss
roots
was
glad
she
said
to
see
him
back
again
he
turned
to
her
with
the
question
that
had
never
failed
to
flatter
and
delight
was
miss
roots
doing
anything
specially
interesting
now
but
there
was
no
interest
in
his
tone
miss
roots
looked
up
with
a
smile
that
would
have
been
gay
if
it
had
not
been
so
weary
yes
she
was
collecting
material
for
a
book
on
antimachus
of
colophon
no
not
her
own
book
at
the
mention
of
antimachus
of
colophon
soper
folded
his
arms
and
frowned
with
implacable
resentment
soper
was
convinced
that
these
subjects
were
introduced
on
purpose
to
exclude
him
from
the
conversation
miss
roots
like
rickman
lived
apart
from
the
murmur
of
the
she
had
raised
a
barrier
of
books
in
a
bedroom
six
feet
by
nine
behind
which
she
worked
obscurely
she
had
never
been
known
to
converse
until
rickman
came
a
sort
of
fluctuating
friendship
had
sprung
up
between
rickman
and
miss
roots
he
had
an
odd
feeling
half
pity
half
liking
for
this
humble
servant
of
literature
doomed
to
its
labour
ignorant
of
its
delight
and
yet
miss
roots
had
a
heart
which
went
out
to
the
journalist
wild
with
youth
and
the
joy
of
letters
and
now
these
things
were
coming
back
to
her
the
sources
of
intellectual
desire
had
been
drying
up
with
the
blood
in
her
cheeks
but
when
rickman
came
they
began
to
flow
again
when
rickman
talked
as
only
he
could
talk
miss
roots
felt
a
faint
fervour
a
reminiscent
thrill
she
preened
her
poor
little
thoughts
as
if
for
pairing
time
when
soul
fluttered
to
soul
across
the
she
knew
that
intellectually
speaking
she
had
been
assigned
to
rickman
for
downey
held
that
just
as
rickman
was
the
first
to
rouse
miss
roots
to
conversation
so
miss
roots
alone
had
the
power
of
drawing
him
out
to
the
best
advantage
indeed
said
rickman
in
a
voice
devoid
of
all
intelligence
now
if
anything
could
have
drawn
rickman
out
it
was
antimachus
of
colophon
four
weeks
ago
he
would
have
been
more
interested
in
antimachus
than
miss
roots
herself
he
would
have
talked
about
him
by
the
hour
together
so
that
when
he
said
nothing
but
indeed
she
perceived
that
something
was
the
matter
with
him
but
she
also
perceived
that
he
was
anxious
to
be
talked
to
therefore
she
talked
on
miss
roots
was
right
though
his
mind
was
unable
to
take
in
a
word
she
said
to
him
he
listened
soothed
by
the
singular
refinement
of
her
voice
it
was
a
quality
he
had
not
noticed
in
it
four
weeks
ago
suddenly
a
word
flashed
out
dividing
the
evening
with
a
line
of
light
so
you
been
staying
in
harmouth
he
started
noticeably
and
looked
at
her
as
if
he
had
not
heard
miss
roots
seemed
unaware
of
having
said
anything
specially
luminous
she
repeated
her
question
with
a
smile
why
he
asked
have
you
been
there
i
not
only
been
there
i
was
born
there
he
looked
at
her
miss
roots
had
always
been
to
say
the
least
of
it
prosaic
and
now
it
was
as
if
poetry
had
dropped
from
her
lips
as
if
she
had
said
i
too
was
born
in
arcadia
i
suppose
she
said
you
saw
that
beautiful
old
house
by
the
river
which
beautiful
old
house
by
the
river
court
house
you
see
it
from
the
bridge
you
must
have
noticed
it
oh
yes
i
know
the
one
you
mean
did
you
happen
to
see
or
hear
anything
of
the
lady
who
lives
in
it
miss
lucia
harden
i
i
must
have
seen
her
but
i
ca
exactly
say
do
you
know
her
his
words
seemed
to
be
torn
from
him
in
pieces
shaken
by
the
violent
beating
of
his
heart
know
her
said
miss
roots
i
lived
five
years
with
her
i
taught
her
he
looked
at
her
again
in
wonder
in
wonder
and
a
sort
of
tenderness
for
a
second
his
heart
had
come
to
life
again
and
leapt
like
a
lunatic
to
his
lips
happily
his
wits
were
there
before
it
he
stroked
his
upper
lip
as
if
brushing
away
some
wild
phrase
that
sat
there
then
i
sure
he
said
contriving
a
smile
that
miss
harden
is
an
exceedingly
well
educated
lady
miss
roots
hazel
eyes
looked
up
at
him
intelligently
but
as
they
met
that
unnatural
smile
of
gallantry
there
was
a
queer
compression
of
her
shrewd
and
strenuous
face
she
changed
the
subject
he
wondered
if
by
any
chance
she
knew
if
she
corresponded
with
miss
harden
if
miss
harden
had
mentioned
him
in
the
days
before
her
troubles
came
if
miss
roots
were
trying
to
test
him
to
draw
him
out
as
she
had
never
drawn
him
out
before
no
it
was
not
in
the
least
likely
that
miss
harden
should
have
mentioned
him
if
she
had
miss
roots
would
have
said
so
she
would
never
have
set
a
trap
for
him
she
was
a
kind
and
straightforward
little
lady
her
queer
look
meant
nothing
it
was
only
her
way
of
dealing
with
a
compliment
the
sweat
on
his
forehead
witnessed
to
the
hot
labour
of
his
thought
he
wondered
whether
anybody
had
observed
it
soper
had
and
drew
his
own
conclusions
been
at
it
again
said
soper
with
significance
but
nobody
took
any
notice
of
him
and
upstairs
in
the
that
night
his
failed
to
charm
i
suppose
you
pleased
said
he
approaching
his
hostess
now
you
got
rickman
back
again
a
deeper
flush
than
the
dinner
could
account
for
was
sole
reply
manners
improved
since
residence
in
the
country
i
met
in
the
city
wy
we
were
on
the
same
slab
of
pavement
and
went
past
and
took
no
more
notice
of
me
than
if
been
the
peabody
statue
depend
upon
it
he
was
full
of
something
full
of
unsociability
and
conceit
and
wot
is
wot
is
father
keeps
a
bookshop
a
very
fine
bookshop
too
said
miss
roots
it
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
ever
spoken
of
her
own
accord
to
soper
he
may
have
come
out
lately
but
you
should
have
seen
the
way
began
in
a
dirty
little
second
shop
in
the
city
a
place
said
soper
i
would
put
my
nose
into
if
i
was
paid
crammed
full
of
narsty
mangy
street
rubbish
look
here
now
said
spinks
now
scarlet
with
fury
you
throw
his
business
in
his
face
for
he
chucked
it
i
do
think
any
the
better
of
him
for
that
do
you
well
he
wo
worry
himself
into
fits
about
your
opinion
he
got
a
new
berth
then
when
he
flung
up
the
old
one
now
one
thing
downey
with
all
her
indulgence
did
not
permit
and
that
was
any
public
allusion
to
her
boarders
affairs
she
might
not
refuse
to
discuss
them
privately
with
miss
bramble
or
miss
roots
but
that
was
a
very
different
thing
therefore
she
maintained
a
dignified
silence
well
then
i
should
like
to
know
he
going
to
pay
way
before
the
grossness
of
this
insinuation
downey
abandoned
her
policy
of
silence
some
day
said
downey
rickman
will
be
in
a
very
different
position
to
wot
he
is
now
you
mark
my
words
and
nobody
marked
them
but
little
flossie
walker
two
tears
rolled
down
downey
face
and
mingled
with
the
tartan
of
her
blouse
a
murmur
of
sympathy
went
round
the
room
and
soper
perceived
that
the
rest
of
the
company
were
sitting
in
an
atmosphere
of
emotion
from
which
he
was
shut
out
i
beg
of
you
soper
that
you
will
let
rickman
be
for
once
this
evening
living
together
as
we
do
we
all
ought
said
downey
to
respect
each
other
feelings
ah
feelings
wot
sort
of
respect
does
your
young
gentleman
ever
show
to
mine
takes
me
up
one
day
and
cuts
me
dead
the
next
he
would
have
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
if
he
had
been
worried
in
his
mind
rickman
soper
is
in
trouble
soper
was
softened
is
he
well
really
i
very
sorry
to
hear
it
very
sorry
i
sure
my
fear
is
said
downey
controlling
her
voice
with
difficulty
that
he
may
be
leaving
us
if
he
does
downey
nobody
will
regret
it
more
than
i
do
well
i
hope
it
wo
come
to
that
downey
did
not
consider
it
politic
to
add
that
she
was
prepared
to
make
any
sacrifice
to
prevent
it
it
was
as
well
that
soper
should
realize
the
consequences
of
an
inability
to
pay
your
way
she
was
not
prepared
to
make
any
sacrifice
for
the
sake
of
keeping
but
what
said
downey
to
herself
will
the
dinner
be
without
mr
rickman
the
dinner
was
in
her
imagination
a
function
a
literary
symposium
at
the
present
moment
if
you
were
to
believe
downey
no
in
london
could
show
such
a
gathering
of
remarkable
people
but
to
none
of
these
remarkable
people
did
downey
feel
as
she
felt
to
rickman
who
was
the
most
remarkable
of
them
all
by
her
own
statement
she
had
enjoyed
exceptional
opportunities
for
studying
the
ways
of
genius
there
was
a
room
at
downey
which
she
exhibited
with
pride
as
blenkinsop
room
blenkinsop
was
a
poet
and
rickman
had
succeeded
him
if
downey
did
not
immediately
recognize
rickman
as
a
genius
it
was
because
he
was
so
utterly
unlike
blenkinsop
but
she
had
felt
from
the
first
that
as
she
expressed
it
there
was
something
about
him
though
what
it
was
she
could
really
say
only
from
the
first
she
had
had
that
feeling
in
her
heart
he
will
not
be
permanent
the
joy
she
had
in
his
youth
and
mystery
was
drenched
with
the
pathos
of
mutability
downey
rebelled
against
mutability
decree
perhaps
she
said
we
might
come
to
some
arrangement
all
night
long
in
her
bedroom
on
the
downey
lay
awake
considering
what
arrangement
could
be
come
to
this
was
but
a
discreet
way
of
stating
her
previous
determination
to
make
any
sacrifice
if
only
she
could
keep
him
the
sacrifice
which
downey
towards
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
found
herself
contemplating
amounted
to
no
less
than
four
shillings
a
week
occupying
his
present
room
he
should
remain
for
shillings
a
week
instead
of
unfortunately
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
their
evil
genius
prompted
spinks
and
soper
to
display
enormous
appetites
and
downey
to
her
everlasting
shame
was
herself
tempted
of
the
devil
a
fall
of
four
shillings
a
week
serious
enough
in
itself
was
not
to
be
contemplated
with
gentlemen
eating
their
heads
off
in
that
fashion
it
would
have
to
be
made
up
in
some
way
to
be
taken
out
of
somebody
or
something
she
would
yes
she
would
take
it
out
of
them
all
round
by
taking
it
out
of
the
dinner
and
yet
when
it
came
to
the
point
downey
soul
recoiled
from
the
immorality
of
this
suggestion
there
rose
before
her
as
in
a
vision
the
dinner
of
the
future
solid
in
essentials
but
docked
of
its
splendour
its
character
and
its
pride
no
that
must
not
be
what
the
dinner
was
now
it
must
remain
as
long
as
there
were
eight
boarders
to
eat
it
if
downey
made
any
sacrifice
she
must
make
it
pure
on
the
condition
said
downey
by
way
of
putting
a
face
on
it
on
the
condition
of
his
permanence
but
it
seemed
that
shillings
were
more
than
rickman
could
afford
to
pay
downey
spent
another
restless
night
and
again
towards
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
she
decided
on
a
plan
after
breakfast
she
watched
soper
out
of
the
closed
the
door
behind
him
with
offensive
and
elaborate
precaution
and
approached
rickman
secretly
if
he
would
promise
not
to
tell
the
other
gentlemen
she
would
let
him
have
the
third
floor
back
for
eighteen
shillings
rickman
stood
by
the
door
like
one
in
great
haste
to
be
gone
he
could
not
afford
eighteen
shillings
either
he
would
stay
where
he
was
on
the
old
terms
for
a
fortnight
at
the
end
of
which
time
he
said
firmly
he
would
be
obliged
to
go
rickman
blue
eyes
were
dark
and
profound
with
the
pathos
of
recent
illness
and
suffering
so
that
he
appeared
to
be
touched
by
downey
kindness
but
he
touched
by
it
no
not
the
least
bit
in
the
world
his
heart
inside
him
was
like
a
great
lump
of
dried
leather
downey
looked
at
him
sighed
and
said
no
more
things
were
more
serious
with
him
than
she
had
supposed
things
were
very
serious
indeed
his
absence
at
harmouth
had
entailed
consequences
that
he
had
not
foreseen
during
those
four
weeks
owing
to
the
perturbation
of
his
mind
and
the
incessant
demands
on
his
time
he
had
written
nothing
true
while
he
was
away
his
poems
had
found
a
publisher
but
he
had
nothing
to
expect
from
them
it
would
be
lucky
if
they
paid
their
expenses
on
his
return
to
town
he
found
that
his
place
on
had
been
filled
up
at
the
most
he
could
only
reckon
on
placing
now
and
then
at
infrequent
intervals
an
article
or
a
poem
the
places
would
be
few
for
from
the
crowd
of
popular
magazines
he
was
excluded
by
the
very
nature
of
his
genius
to
make
matters
worse
he
owed
about
thirty
pounds
to
dicky
pilkington
the
sum
of
two
guineas
which
owed
him
for
his
sonnet
would
if
he
accepted
downey
last
offer
keep
him
for
exactly
two
weeks
and
afterwards
afterwards
of
course
he
would
have
to
borrow
another
ten
pounds
from
dicky
hire
some
den
at
a
few
shillings
a
week
and
try
his
luck
for
as
many
months
as
his
money
held
out
then
there
would
be
another
afterwards
but
that
need
not
concern
him
now
the
only
thing
that
concerned
him
was
the
occult
tie
between
him
and
miss
roots
up
to
the
day
fixed
for
his
departure
he
was
drawn
by
an
irresistible
fascination
to
miss
roots
his
manner
to
her
became
marked
by
an
extreme
gentleness
and
sympathy
of
course
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
it
was
miss
roots
who
lit
the
intellectual
flame
that
burnt
in
lucia
enough
to
know
that
she
had
sat
with
her
in
the
library
and
in
the
room
where
she
made
music
that
she
had
walked
with
her
in
the
old
green
garden
and
on
harcombe
hill
and
muttersmoor
enough
to
sit
beside
miss
roots
and
know
that
all
the
time
her
heart
was
where
his
was
and
that
if
he
were
to
speak
of
these
things
she
would
kindle
and
understand
but
he
did
not
speak
of
them
for
from
the
way
miss
roots
had
referred
to
lucia
harden
and
to
court
house
it
was
evident
that
she
knew
nothing
of
what
had
happened
to
them
and
he
did
not
feel
equal
to
telling
her
lucia
pain
was
so
great
a
part
of
his
pain
that
as
yet
he
could
not
touch
it
but
though
he
never
openly
approached
the
subject
of
harmouth
he
was
for
ever
skirting
it
keeping
it
in
sight
he
came
very
near
to
it
one
evening
when
finding
himself
alone
with
miss
roots
in
the
back
he
asked
her
how
long
it
was
since
she
had
been
in
devonshire
it
seemed
that
it
was
no
longer
ago
than
last
year
only
last
year
it
was
still
warm
then
the
link
between
her
and
the
woman
whom
he
loved
he
found
himself
looking
at
miss
roots
scanning
the
lines
of
her
plain
face
as
if
it
held
for
him
some
new
and
wonderful
significance
for
him
that
faced
flamed
transfigured
as
in
the
moment
when
she
had
first
spoken
of
lucia
the
thin
lips
which
had
seemed
to
him
so
utterly
unattractive
had
touched
lucia
and
were
baptized
into
her
freshness
and
her
charm
her
eyes
had
looked
into
lucia
and
carried
something
of
their
light
in
her
presence
he
drifted
into
a
sort
of
mysticism
peculiar
to
lovers
seeing
the
hand
of
a
holy
destiny
in
the
chance
that
had
seated
him
beside
her
though
her
shrewdness
might
divine
his
secret
he
felt
that
with
her
it
would
be
safe
as
for
his
other
companions
of
the
he
was
obliged
to
admit
that
they
displayed
an
admirable
delicacy
after
revelation
not
one
of
them
had
asked
him
what
he
had
been
doing
those
four
weeks
spinks
had
a
theory
which
he
kept
to
himself
old
rickets
had
been
having
a
high
old
time
he
had
eloped
with
a
barmaid
or
an
opera
girl
for
those
four
weeks
he
had
no
doubt
rickets
had
been
gloriously
ruinously
on
the
loose
downey
speculations
had
taken
the
same
turn
rickman
extraordinary
request
that
all
his
clean
linen
should
be
forwarded
to
him
at
once
had
set
her
mind
working
it
suggested
a
young
man
living
in
luxury
beyond
his
means
downey
fancy
kindled
and
blushed
by
turns
as
it
followed
him
into
a
glorious
or
disreputable
unknown
whatever
the
adventures
of
those
four
weeks
she
felt
that
they
were
responsible
for
his
awful
state
of
impecuniosity
and
yet
she
desired
to
keep
him
there
is
something
about
him
said
downey
to
miss
roots
and
paused
searching
for
the
illuminating
word
something
that
goes
to
your
heart
without
knowing
it
she
had
found
it
the
nameless
ineluctable
charm
and
so
for
those
last
days
the
dinner
became
a
high
funereal
ceremony
increasing
in
valedictory
splendour
that
proclaimed
unmistakably
rickman
is
going
in
a
neighbouring
street
he
had
found
a
room
cheap
and
passably
clean
and
failing
a
financial
miracle
worked
on
his
behalf
he
would
move
into
it
he
was
going
now
that
he
would
have
given
anything
to
stay
in
the
after
dinner
spinks
with
a
dejected
countenance
sat
guarding
for
the
last
time
the
sacred
silence
of
rickman
they
had
finished
their
coffee
when
the
door
that
let
out
the
maid
with
empty
cups
let
in
miss
bishop
miss
bramble
and
miss
walker
first
came
miss
bishop
she
advanced
in
a
and
embarrassed
manner
giggling
and
her
face
for
once
was
as
red
as
her
hair
she
carried
a
little
wooden
box
which
with
an
unaccustomed
shyness
she
asked
him
to
accept
the
sliding
lid
disclosed
a
dozen
cedar
pencils
side
by
side
their
points
all
ready
sharpened
also
a
card
with
the
inscription
rickman
with
best
wishes
from
ada
bishop
at
one
corner
was
a
date
suggesting
that
the
gift
marked
an
epoch
at
the
other
the
letters
the
reverse
displayed
this
legend
if
you
ever
want
any
typing
done
i
always
do
it
for
at
a
thou
do
let
yours
now
miss
bishop
usual
charge
was
as
he
knew
a
shilling
per
thousand
gentlemen
said
she
explaining
away
her
modest
offering
always
like
anything
that
saves
them
trouble
at
this
point
miss
bishop
torn
by
a
supreme
giggle
vanished
violently
from
the
scene
rickman
smiled
sadly
but
his
heart
remained
as
before
he
had
not
loved
miss
bishop
next
came
miss
bramble
with
her
gift
mysteriously
concealed
in
silver
paper
all
said
miss
bramble
suffered
from
cold
feet
so
she
had
just
knitted
him
a
pair
of
socks
in
a
whisper
that
would
help
to
keep
him
warm
her
poor
old
eyes
were
scarlet
not
so
much
from
knitting
the
as
from
contemplating
the
terrible
possibility
of
his
needing
them
under
rickman
waistcoat
there
was
the
least
little
ghost
of
a
quiver
he
had
not
loved
miss
bramble
but
miss
bramble
had
loved
him
she
had
loved
him
because
he
was
young
and
because
he
had
sometimes
repeated
to
her
the
little
jests
that
she
was
too
deaf
to
hear
last
of
the
three
very
grave
and
demure
came
flossie
and
she
like
her
friend
carried
her
gift
uncovered
she
proffered
it
with
her
most
becoming
air
of
correctness
and
propriety
it
was
a
cabinet
photograph
of
herself
in
her
best
attitude
her
best
mood
and
her
best
blue
blouse
it
was
framed
beautifully
and
appropriately
in
white
silk
embroidered
with
blue
by
flossie
clever
hands
she
had
sat
up
half
the
night
to
finish
it
he
took
it
gently
from
her
and
looked
at
it
for
what
seemed
to
flossie
an
excessively
long
time
he
was
trying
to
think
of
something
particularly
pretty
and
suitable
to
say
in
his
absorption
he
did
not
notice
that
he
was
alone
with
her
that
as
flossie
advanced
spinks
and
soper
had
withdrawn
i
do
know
whether
you
care
for
it
said
she
she
was
standing
very
close
beside
him
and
her
face
under
the
looked
pale
and
tender
of
course
i
care
for
it
he
laid
her
gift
on
the
table
beside
the
others
and
stood
contemplating
them
she
saw
him
smile
he
was
smiling
at
the
you
are
all
much
too
good
to
me
you
know
oh
rickman
you
been
so
awfully
good
to
me
he
looked
round
a
little
anxiously
and
perceived
that
they
were
alone
no
flossie
he
said
i
not
been
good
to
anyone
i
not
very
good
to
myself
all
the
same
i
not
an
utter
brute
i
sha
forget
you
flossie
eyes
had
followed
almost
jealously
the
movement
of
his
hand
in
putting
down
her
gift
and
they
had
rested
there
fixed
on
her
own
portrait
and
veiled
by
their
large
white
lids
she
now
raised
them
suddenly
and
over
their
black
profundity
there
moved
a
curious
golden
glitter
that
flashed
full
on
his
face
you
did
remember
me
much
last
time
you
went
away
i
did
remember
anybody
flossie
i
had
too
much
to
think
of
it
struck
him
that
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
looked
him
full
in
the
face
but
it
did
not
strike
him
that
it
was
also
the
first
time
that
he
had
found
himself
alone
in
a
room
with
her
though
they
had
been
together
many
times
out
of
doors
and
in
crowded
theatres
and
concert
halls
her
look
conveyed
some
accusation
that
he
at
first
failed
to
understand
and
then
there
came
into
his
mind
the
promise
he
had
made
to
her
at
easter
to
take
her
to
the
play
the
promise
broken
without
apology
or
explanation
so
she
still
resented
it
did
she
poor
little
flossie
she
was
so
plump
and
pretty
and
she
had
been
so
dependent
on
him
for
the
small
pleasures
of
her
life
you
always
thinking
said
flossie
and
laughed
i
sorry
flossie
it
a
disgusting
habit
i
own
i
make
up
for
it
some
day
we
do
a
lot
of
theatres
and
and
things
together
when
my
ship
comes
in
thank
you
rickman
said
she
with
a
return
to
her
old
demeanour
and
now
i
suppose
i
better
say
she
turned
they
said
he
sprang
to
open
the
door
for
her
as
she
went
through
it
his
heart
if
it
did
not
go
with
her
was
touched
most
palpably
unmistakably
touched
at
seeing
her
go
he
had
not
loved
flossie
but
he
might
have
loved
her
soper
who
had
been
waiting
all
the
while
on
the
stairs
walked
in
through
the
open
door
he
closed
it
secretly
he
laid
his
hand
affectionately
on
rickman
shoulder
rickman
he
said
solemnly
while
i
the
opportunity
i
want
to
speak
to
you
if
it
should
that
a
fiver
would
be
useful
to
you
do
you
hesitate
to
come
to
me
oh
soper
thanks
most
awfully
really
no
i
could
think
of
it
but
i
mean
it
i
really
do
so
do
you
and
there
be
any
hurry
about
repayment
that
said
soper
is
quite
immaterial
failing
to
extract
from
rickman
any
distinct
promise
he
withdrew
but
not
before
he
had
pressed
upon
his
immediate
acceptance
a
box
of
his
favourites
the
flor
di
dindigul
by
this
time
rickman
heart
was
exceedingly
uncomfortable
inside
him
he
had
hated
soper
he
thought
it
was
all
over
and
he
was
glad
to
escape
from
these
really
very
trying
interviews
to
the
quiet
of
his
own
room
there
he
found
spinks
sitting
on
his
bed
waiting
for
him
spinks
had
come
to
lay
before
him
an
offering
and
a
scheme
the
offering
was
no
less
than
two
dozen
of
gents
best
knitted
hose
and
heeled
the
scheme
was
for
enabling
rickman
thenceforward
to
purchase
all
manner
of
retail
haberdashery
at
wholesale
prices
by
the
simple
method
of
impersonating
spinks
at
least
in
the
it
amounted
to
that
and
rickman
had
some
difficulty
in
persuading
spinks
that
his
scheme
though
in
the
last
degree
glorious
and
romantic
was
from
an
ethical
point
of
view
not
strictly
feasible
what
a
rum
joker
you
are
rickman
i
never
thought
of
that
i
wonder
he
mused
in
an
unconscious
endeavour
to
restore
the
moral
balance
between
him
and
rickman
i
wonder
who
put
you
to
bed
old
chappy
when
you
tight
do
fret
spinky
i
almost
afraid
that
i
shall
never
be
tight
again
in
this
world
oh
gosh
said
spinks
and
sighed
profoundly
then
with
a
slight
recovery
do
you
mean
you
wo
be
able
to
afford
it
you
can
put
it
that
way
if
you
like
in
time
spinks
left
him
and
rickman
was
alone
just
as
he
was
wondering
whether
or
no
he
would
pack
his
books
up
before
turning
in
there
was
a
soft
rap
at
his
door
he
said
come
in
to
the
rap
and
to
himself
he
said
who
next
it
was
downey
she
glanced
round
the
room
looked
at
photograph
with
disapproval
and
removed
not
without
severity
miss
bramble
from
a
chair
she
had
brought
no
gift
but
she
sat
down
heavily
like
a
woman
who
has
carried
a
burden
about
with
her
all
day
and
can
carry
it
no
farther
her
features
were
almost
obliterated
with
emotion
and
glazed
with
tears
that
she
made
no
effort
to
remove
rickman
she
said
do
you
reelly
wish
to
go
or
do
you
not
he
looked
up
surprised
my
dear
downey
i
do
believe
me
did
i
ever
say
i
did
her
face
grew
brighter
and
rounder
till
the
very
glaze
on
it
made
it
shine
like
a
great
red
sun
well
we
all
been
wondering
and
some
of
us
said
one
thing
and
some
another
and
i
did
know
what
to
think
but
if
you
want
to
stay
perhaps
we
can
come
to
some
arrangement
it
was
the
consecrated
phrase
he
shook
his
head
come
i
been
thinking
it
over
you
wo
be
paying
less
than
five
shillings
a
week
for
your
empty
room
perhaps
more
he
would
he
said
be
paying
six
shillings
there
now
and
that
with
your
food
makes
sixteen
shillings
at
the
very
least
well
it
depends
upon
the
food
i
should
think
it
did
depend
upon
it
downey
face
literally
blazed
with
triumph
she
said
to
herself
i
was
right
spinks
said
he
take
it
out
of
his
clothes
miss
bramble
said
he
take
it
out
of
his
fire
said
he
take
it
out
of
his
dinner
now
she
continued
if
you
did
mind
moving
into
the
front
attic
it
a
good
attic
for
a
time
i
could
let
you
that
board
you
for
fifteen
shillings
a
week
or
for
fourteen
i
could
and
welcome
as
i
seldom
let
that
attic
it
would
be
money
in
the
pocket
to
me
come
she
went
on
well
pleased
i
know
all
about
it
why
blenkinsop
when
he
first
started
to
write
he
lived
up
there
six
months
at
a
time
he
had
his
ups
you
may
say
and
his
downs
one
year
in
the
attic
and
the
next
on
the
second
floor
having
his
meals
separate
and
his
own
apartments
then
up
he
go
again
quite
cheerful
as
regularly
as
the
bills
came
round
here
downey
entered
at
some
length
upon
the
history
of
the
splendour
and
misery
of
blenkinsop
and
that
i
suppose
said
downey
is
what
it
is
to
be
a
poet
in
fact
said
rickman
relating
the
incident
afterwards
to
miss
roots
talk
to
downey
of
the
attic
bee
and
she
will
thoroughly
understand
the
allusion
after
about
half
an
hour
conversation
she
left
him
without
having
received
any
clear
and
definite
acceptance
of
her
proposal
that
did
not
prevent
her
from
announcing
to
the
that
rickman
was
not
going
after
all
at
the
hour
of
the
last
post
a
letter
was
pushed
under
his
door
it
was
from
horace
jewdwine
asking
him
to
dine
with
him
at
hampstead
the
next
evening
nothing
more
nothing
less
but
the
sight
of
the
signature
made
his
brain
reel
for
a
second
he
stood
staring
at
it
from
the
adjoining
room
came
sounds
made
by
spinks
dancing
a
jig
of
joy
which
brought
up
soper
raging
from
the
floor
below
jewdwine
why
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
after
the
affair
of
the
harden
library
jewdwine
most
certainly
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him
jewdwine
was
another
link
and
at
that
thought
his
heart
heaved
and
became
alive
again
chapter
xxxix
in
the
act
of
death
as
in
everything
else
that
he
had
ever
done
sir
frederick
harden
had
hit
on
the
most
inappropriate
the
most
inconvenient
moment
the
moment
that
is
to
say
when
horace
jewdwine
had
been
appointed
editor
of
when
every
minute
of
his
day
was
taken
up
with
forming
his
staff
and
thoroughly
reorganizing
the
business
of
his
paper
it
was
besides
the
moment
for
which
all
his
years
at
oxford
had
been
a
training
and
a
consecration
it
was
that
supreme
that
nuptial
moment
in
which
an
ambitious
man
embraces
for
the
first
time
his
opportunity
the
news
of
lucia
trouble
found
him
as
it
were
in
the
ardours
and
preoccupations
of
the
honeymoon
it
was
characteristic
of
jewdwine
that
in
this
courting
of
opportunity
there
had
been
no
violent
pursuit
no
dishevelment
no
seizing
by
the
hair
he
had
hung
back
rather
he
had
waited
till
he
had
given
himself
value
till
opportunity
had
come
to
him
with
delicate
and
ceremonious
approach
still
his
head
had
swum
a
little
at
her
coming
so
that
in
the
contemplation
of
his
golden
bride
he
had
for
the
time
being
lost
sight
of
lucia
as
for
marrying
his
cousin
that
was
a
question
with
which
for
the
present
he
felt
he
really
could
not
deal
no
doubt
it
would
crop
up
again
later
on
to
worry
him
meanwhile
he
gave
to
lucia
every
minute
that
he
could
spare
from
the
allurements
of
his
golden
bride
for
more
than
a
fortnight
her
affairs
had
been
weighing
on
him
like
a
nightmare
but
only
like
a
nightmare
a
thing
that
troubled
him
chiefly
in
the
watches
of
the
night
leaving
his
waking
thoughts
free
to
go
about
the
business
of
the
day
a
thing
against
which
he
felt
that
it
was
impossible
to
contend
for
affairs
had
the
vagueness
the
confusion
of
a
nightmare
details
no
doubt
there
were
but
they
had
disappeared
in
the
immensity
of
the
general
effect
being
powerless
to
deal
with
them
himself
he
had
sent
down
his
own
solicitor
to
assist
in
disentangling
them
but
as
the
full
meaning
of
the
disaster
sank
into
him
he
realized
with
the
cold
pang
of
disappointment
that
their
marriage
must
now
be
indefinitely
postponed
to
be
sure
what
had
as
yet
passed
between
them
hardly
amounted
to
an
understanding
all
jewdwine
understandings
had
been
with
himself
but
the
very
fact
that
he
was
not
prepared
to
act
on
such
an
understanding
made
him
feel
as
responsible
as
if
it
actually
existed
being
conscious
of
something
rather
more
than
cousinly
tenderness
in
the
past
he
really
could
not
be
sure
that
he
was
not
already
irretrievably
committed
not
that
lucia
manner
had
ever
taken
anything
of
the
sort
for
granted
he
had
nothing
to
fear
from
her
but
he
had
much
he
told
himself
to
fear
from
his
own
conscience
and
his
honour
all
this
was
the
result
of
deliberate
reflection
in
the
beginning
of
the
trouble
at
the
first
news
of
his
uncle
death
his
sympathy
with
lucia
had
been
free
from
any
sordid
anxiety
for
the
future
which
he
then
conceived
to
be
inseparably
bound
up
with
his
own
letter
was
the
first
intimation
that
anything
had
gone
wrong
it
was
a
shock
none
the
less
severe
because
it
was
not
altogether
a
surprise
it
was
just
like
his
uncle
frederick
to
raise
money
on
the
harden
library
the
shock
lay
in
rickman
assumption
that
he
jewdwine
was
prepared
instantly
at
ten
days
notice
to
redeem
it
it
was
what
he
would
have
liked
to
have
done
what
if
he
had
been
a
rich
man
he
infallibly
would
have
done
what
even
now
with
his
limited
resources
he
might
do
if
it
were
not
for
the
risk
rickman
had
assured
him
that
there
was
no
risk
had
implied
almost
that
it
was
an
opportunity
a
splendid
investment
for
his
money
he
could
see
for
himself
that
it
was
his
chance
of
doing
beautiful
thing
for
lucia
looking
back
upon
it
all
afterwards
long
afterwards
he
found
consolation
in
the
thought
that
his
first
or
nearly
his
first
impulse
had
been
generous
at
first
too
he
had
not
given
a
thought
to
rickman
except
as
the
medium
the
unauthorized
and
somewhat
curious
medium
of
a
very
startling
communication
enough
that
he
was
expected
to
produce
at
ten
days
notice
a
sum
which
might
be
anything
you
pleased
over
one
thousand
two
hundred
pounds
it
was
not
until
he
realized
that
he
was
seriously
invited
to
contend
with
rickman
in
a
private
bid
for
the
harden
library
that
he
began
to
criticize
rickman
movement
in
the
matter
everything
depended
on
rickman
estimate
of
the
risk
and
rickman
was
not
infallible
in
denying
rickman
infallibility
he
had
not
as
yet
committed
himself
to
any
harsh
judgement
of
his
friend
his
first
really
unpleasant
reflection
was
that
rickman
information
was
unsatisfactory
because
vague
his
next
that
rickman
was
giving
him
precious
little
time
for
deliberation
he
was
excessively
annoyed
with
rickman
upon
both
these
heads
but
chiefly
upon
the
latter
he
was
being
hurried
he
might
almost
say
that
pressure
was
being
put
on
him
and
why
it
was
at
this
point
he
found
himself
drawn
into
that
dangerous
line
the
attributing
of
motives
he
perceived
in
rickman
suggestion
a
readiness
an
eagerness
to
stand
back
and
as
it
were
pass
on
the
harden
library
rickman
was
a
sharp
fellow
he
knew
pretty
well
what
he
was
about
jewdwine
mind
went
back
to
the
dawn
of
their
acquaintance
and
to
a
certain
florio
montaigne
rickman
had
got
the
better
of
him
over
that
florio
montaigne
hitherto
whenever
jewdwine
had
thought
of
that
little
transaction
he
had
smiled
in
spite
of
himself
he
really
could
not
help
admiring
the
smartness
of
a
young
man
who
had
worsted
him
in
a
bargain
jewdwine
was
a
terror
to
all
the
booksellers
in
london
and
oxford
he
would
waste
so
much
of
their
good
time
in
cheapening
a
book
that
it
was
hardly
worth
their
while
to
sell
it
to
him
at
double
the
price
originally
asked
the
idea
that
he
had
paid
five
shillings
for
a
book
that
he
should
have
got
for
four
and
six
would
keep
jewdwine
awake
at
night
and
now
his
thought
advanced
by
rapid
steps
in
the
direction
unfavourable
to
rickman
rickman
had
driven
a
clever
bargain
over
that
florio
montaigne
rickman
had
cheated
him
yes
cheated
him
infamously
over
that
florio
montaigne
you
could
see
a
great
deal
through
a
very
small
hole
and
a
man
who
would
cheat
you
over
a
florio
montaigne
would
cheat
you
over
a
whole
library
if
he
got
the
chance
not
that
there
was
any
cheating
in
the
it
was
each
man
for
himself
and
the
lord
for
us
all
the
question
was
what
was
young
rickman
driving
at
and
what
was
he
jewdwine
being
let
in
for
now
he
found
himself
unable
to
accept
rickman
alleged
motive
in
all
its
grand
simplicity
it
was
too
simple
and
too
grand
to
be
entirely
probable
if
young
rickman
was
not
infallible
he
was
an
expert
in
his
trade
he
was
not
likely
to
be
grossly
mistaken
in
his
valuation
if
the
harden
library
would
be
worth
four
or
five
thousand
pounds
to
jewdwine
it
would
be
worth
as
much
or
more
to
rickman
young
rickman
being
merely
old
assistant
he
could
hardly
be
acting
without
his
father
knowledge
if
young
rickman
honestly
thought
that
the
library
was
worth
that
sum
it
was
not
likely
that
they
would
let
the
prize
slip
out
of
their
hands
the
thing
was
not
in
human
nature
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
he
was
convinced
that
it
was
a
job
he
strongly
suspected
that
young
rickman
in
the
rashness
of
his
youth
had
proceeded
farther
than
he
cared
to
own
that
rickman
found
themselves
let
in
for
a
bad
bargain
and
were
anxious
to
get
out
of
it
young
rickman
had
no
doubt
discovered
that
the
great
harden
library
was
not
the
prize
they
had
always
imagined
it
to
be
jewdwine
remembered
that
there
was
no
record
no
proper
catalogue
or
if
there
ever
had
been
it
had
been
mislaid
or
lost
he
had
a
vision
unconsciously
exaggerated
of
the
inconceivable
disorder
of
the
place
when
he
had
last
visited
it
and
as
he
recalled
those
great
gaps
on
the
shelves
it
struck
him
that
the
library
had
been
gutted
his
uncle
frederick
had
not
been
altogether
the
fool
he
seemed
to
be
nothing
was
more
likely
than
that
he
knew
perfectly
well
the
value
of
the
volumes
that
were
the
unique
glory
of
the
collection
and
had
long
ago
turned
them
into
ready
money
the
rest
would
be
comparatively
worthless
he
read
rickman
letter
over
again
and
had
a
moment
of
compunction
it
seemed
a
very
simple
and
straightforward
letter
but
then
rickman
was
a
very
clever
fellow
he
had
the
gift
of
expression
and
there
was
that
florio
montaigne
he
would
have
suspected
him
if
only
his
record
had
been
pure
so
instead
of
committing
himself
by
writing
to
rickman
he
had
sent
his
solicitor
down
to
look
into
these
matters
a
day
or
two
later
in
reply
to
his
further
inquiries
his
solicitor
assured
him
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
library
was
intact
to
jewdwine
in
his
present
state
of
mind
this
information
was
upsetting
it
not
only
compelled
him
to
modify
his
opinion
of
rickman
after
having
formed
it
but
it
threw
him
back
on
the
agony
and
responsibility
of
decision
on
the
last
morning
of
the
term
allowed
him
for
reflection
he
received
that
hurried
note
from
rickman
who
had
flung
all
his
emotions
into
one
agonized
line
for
god
sake
wire
me
what
you
mean
to
do
the
young
poet
so
careful
of
his
prose
style
had
not
perceived
that
what
he
had
written
was
blank
verse
of
the
purest
which
to
jewdwine
in
itself
sufficiently
revealed
the
disorder
of
his
mind
that
de
rang
in
jewdwine
brain
for
the
next
hours
then
at
the
last
moment
he
came
forward
with
an
offer
of
one
thousand
three
hundred
the
next
day
he
heard
from
lucia
what
indeed
he
feared
that
he
had
stepped
in
too
late
the
library
was
sold
to
isaac
rickman
his
dominant
emotion
was
now
anger
he
was
furious
with
rickman
for
not
having
given
him
more
time
he
forgot
his
own
delay
his
fears
and
vacillations
he
felt
that
he
would
have
done
this
thing
if
he
had
only
had
more
time
he
had
no
doubt
that
rickman
had
meant
honestly
by
him
but
he
had
blundered
he
could
and
he
should
have
given
him
more
time
but
gradually
as
the
certainty
of
his
own
generosity
grew
on
him
his
indignation
cooled
reinstated
in
his
he
could
afford
to
do
justice
to
rickman
what
was
more
now
that
the
danger
was
over
he
saw
his
risk
more
clearly
than
ever
he
had
a
vision
of
his
brilliant
future
clouded
by
a
debt
of
one
thousand
three
hundred
pounds
impetuously
raised
on
the
unknown
of
the
harden
library
hung
like
a
round
his
neck
he
had
no
doubt
that
rickman
in
the
very
ardour
of
his
honesty
had
greatly
exaggerated
its
value
and
as
he
surveyed
the
probable
consequences
of
his
own
superb
impulse
he
was
almost
grateful
to
rickman
for
not
having
given
him
time
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
thanks
to
rickman
he
had
now
all
the
credit
of
that
reckless
offer
without
the
risk
a
week
later
he
had
a
long
letter
from
lucia
she
thanked
him
with
much
warmth
and
affection
for
his
generosity
it
was
evident
that
it
had
touched
her
deeply
she
assured
him
as
she
had
assured
him
before
that
she
needed
no
help
the
library
had
sold
for
twelve
hundred
pounds
and
two
hundred
had
been
handed
over
to
her
pilkington
was
afraid
that
no
further
sum
would
be
forthcoming
from
the
sale
of
the
pictures
and
furniture
which
had
been
valued
over
rather
than
under
their
present
market
price
and
represented
the
bulk
of
the
security
still
she
hoped
to
sell
court
house
it
could
not
bring
in
less
than
five
thousand
that
and
a
small
part
of
her
capital
would
pay
off
all
remaining
debts
it
was
a
wearisome
business
but
horace
would
be
glad
to
hear
that
she
would
come
out
of
it
not
owing
a
farthing
to
anybody
and
would
still
have
enough
to
live
on
yes
jewdwine
had
his
pride
he
was
glad
that
his
disreputable
affairs
had
not
landed
him
in
the
bankruptcy
court
after
all
but
he
had
a
movement
of
indignation
on
lucia
account
and
of
admiration
for
lucia
no
more
of
herself
or
her
affairs
the
rest
was
concerned
with
rickman
and
his
my
dear
horace
she
wrote
we
must
do
something
for
this
poor
little
friend
of
yours
you
were
quite
right
about
him
he
is
a
genius
but
fortunately
or
perhaps
unfortunately
for
himself
he
is
so
much
else
besides
to
think
that
of
all
people
should
be
entangled
in
our
miserable
business
he
has
got
badly
hurt
too
first
of
all
it
preyed
on
his
mind
till
he
worried
himself
into
a
nervous
fever
kitty
palliser
who
saw
him
said
he
was
nearly
off
his
head
it
seems
he
considered
his
honour
implicated
as
it
happens
he
has
behaved
splendidly
he
did
everything
in
his
power
to
prevent
our
losing
the
library
or
at
any
rate
to
keep
it
out
of
his
hands
and
the
mere
fact
that
he
failed
does
lessen
our
obligation
he
has
simply
ruined
his
own
prospects
in
the
attempt
do
you
know
he
tried
to
force
his
father
to
withdraw
by
threatening
to
leave
their
business
if
he
did
and
he
had
to
keep
his
word
the
horrible
thing
is
that
i
actually
owe
him
money
money
which
he
wo
take
he
had
been
working
hard
for
three
weeks
on
a
catalogue
for
me
and
is
insulted
at
the
bare
suggestion
of
payment
and
here
he
is
absolutely
stranded
in
debt
i
believe
and
without
a
farthing
what
in
the
world
am
i
to
do
poor
lucy
thought
jewdwine
as
if
she
had
enough
to
bear
without
having
rickman
on
her
shoulders
it
seems
to
me
that
as
he
has
done
all
this
for
us
we
ought
to
stand
by
him
if
you
do
anything
for
him
could
you
help
him
with
some
introductions
or
better
still
give
him
work
at
any
rate
till
he
has
found
his
feet
i
sure
you
can
count
on
his
devotion
dear
lucy
she
might
be
recommending
me
a
valet
do
something
for
him
and
you
will
oblige
me
more
than
i
can
say
that
letter
of
lucia
gave
jewdwine
much
matter
for
reflection
and
some
pain
he
had
winced
at
the
sale
of
court
house
it
struck
him
as
a
personal
blow
he
had
had
a
kind
of
tacit
understanding
with
himself
that
in
that
future
which
he
had
meant
to
share
with
lucia
court
house
would
be
the
home
of
his
retirement
still
it
must
go
he
had
to
live
in
town
and
if
at
the
moment
he
could
have
afforded
to
marry
a
penniless
lucia
he
could
not
have
afforded
two
establishments
as
for
the
redemption
of
the
harden
library
he
realized
with
a
sharp
pang
that
risk
there
had
been
none
he
saw
that
what
young
rickman
had
offered
him
was
a
unique
and
splendid
opportunity
the
opportunity
of
doing
a
beautiful
thing
for
lucia
and
that
without
the
smallest
inconvenience
to
himself
and
this
opportunity
had
been
missed
just
because
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
about
rickman
could
not
see
what
lucia
had
always
seen
what
he
too
saw
now
that
positively
luminous
sincerity
of
his
he
saw
it
even
now
reluctantly
though
he
could
never
veer
round
again
to
his
absurd
theory
of
dishonesty
he
would
have
liked
if
he
could
to
regard
him
as
a
culpable
bungler
but
even
this
consoling
view
was
closed
to
him
by
lucia
it
was
plain
from
her
account
that
rickman
task
had
been
beyond
human
power
jewdwine
therefore
was
forced
to
the
painful
conclusion
that
for
this
loss
to
himself
and
lucia
he
had
nothing
to
blame
but
his
own
vacillation
as
for
rickman
lucia
had
taken
a
great
deal
of
pains
with
that
part
of
her
subject
for
she
was
determined
to
do
justice
to
it
she
was
aware
that
it
was
open
to
her
to
take
the
ordinary
practical
view
of
rickman
as
a
culpable
blunderer
who
by
holding
his
tongue
when
he
should
have
spoken
had
involved
her
in
the
loss
of
much
valuable
property
to
an
ordinary
practical
woman
the
fact
that
this
blunder
had
entailed
such
serious
consequences
to
herself
would
have
made
any
other
theory
impossible
but
lucia
was
not
a
woman
who
could
be
depended
on
for
any
ordinary
practical
view
mere
material
issues
could
never
confuse
her
estimate
of
spiritual
values
to
her
rickman
conduct
in
that
instance
was
a
flaw
in
honour
and
as
such
she
had
already
sufficiently
judged
it
the
significant
thing
was
that
he
too
should
have
so
judged
it
that
he
should
have
been
capable
of
such
profound
suffering
in
the
thought
of
it
and
now
somehow
it
did
seem
to
her
to
count
it
simply
disappeared
in
her
final
pure
and
luminous
view
of
character
what
really
counted
was
the
alertness
of
his
whole
attitude
to
honour
his
readiness
to
follow
the
voice
of
his
own
ultimate
vision
to
repudiate
the
unclean
thing
revealed
in
its
uncleanness
above
all
what
counted
was
his
passionate
sincerity
with
her
unerring
instinct
of
selection
lucia
had
again
seized
on
the
essential
the
triumph
of
rickman
greater
qualities
appealed
to
her
as
a
spectacle
it
was
not
spoiled
for
her
by
the
reflection
that
she
personally
had
been
more
affected
by
his
failure
if
she
showed
her
insight
into
rickman
character
by
admitting
the
relative
insignificance
of
that
failure
she
showed
an
equal
insight
into
jewdwine
by
suppressing
all
mention
of
it
now
for
horace
would
have
regarded
it
as
essential
it
would
have
loomed
large
in
his
view
by
reason
of
its
material
consequences
allowing
for
horace
view
she
kept
her
portrait
truer
by
omitting
it
and
jewdwine
accepted
her
portrait
as
the
true
one
it
appealed
irresistibly
to
his
artistic
sense
he
was
by
profession
a
connoisseur
of
things
beautifully
done
rickman
behaviour
as
described
by
lucia
revived
his
earlier
amused
admiration
for
his
young
disciple
it
was
so
like
him
in
its
spontaneity
its
unexpectedness
its
its
colossal
impertinence
it
was
pure
rickman
lucia
had
achieved
a
masterpiece
of
appreciation
but
what
helped
him
in
his
almost
joyous
of
his
rickman
was
his
perception
that
here
in
doing
justice
to
rickman
lay
his
chance
of
rehabilitating
himself
if
he
could
not
buy
back
the
harden
library
he
could
at
any
rate
redeem
his
own
character
he
did
not
hold
himself
responsible
for
lucia
father
debts
but
he
was
willing
not
to
say
glad
to
take
up
lucia
it
was
certainly
most
improper
that
she
should
be
under
any
obligation
to
rickman
in
any
case
rickman
action
concerned
lucia
family
as
much
as
lucia
that
is
to
say
it
was
his
jewdwine
affair
and
personally
he
disliked
indebtedness
another
man
might
have
handed
rickman
a
cheque
for
fifty
pounds
the
price
of
the
catalogue
and
washed
his
hands
of
him
but
jewdwine
was
incapable
of
that
grossness
he
gave
the
matter
a
fortnight
delicate
consideration
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
had
made
up
his
mind
not
only
to
invite
rickman
to
contribute
regularly
to
a
thing
he
would
have
done
in
any
case
but
to
offer
him
temporarily
the
rash
as
this
resolution
seemed
jewdwine
had
fenced
himself
carefully
from
any
risk
the
arrangement
was
not
to
be
considered
permanent
until
rickman
had
proved
himself
both
capable
and
steady
if
then
in
giving
him
any
work
at
all
on
jewdwine
felt
that
he
was
stretching
a
point
it
was
a
somewhat
liberal
rendering
of
his
editorial
programme
was
the
one
solitary
literary
journal
that
had
the
courage
to
profess
openly
a
philosophy
of
criticism
its
philosophy
might
be
obsolete
it
might
be
fantastic
it
might
be
altogether
wrong
the
point
was
that
it
was
there
its
presence
was
a
protest
against
the
spirit
of
anarchy
in
the
world
of
letters
the
paper
had
lost
influence
lately
owing
to
a
certain
rigidity
in
the
methods
of
its
late
editor
also
to
an
increasing
dulness
in
its
style
it
was
suffering
like
all
old
things
from
the
unequal
competition
with
insurgent
youth
the
proprietors
were
almost
relieved
when
the
death
of
its
editor
provided
them
with
a
suitable
opportunity
for
giving
it
over
into
the
hands
of
younger
men
we
want
new
blood
said
the
proprietors
the
difficulty
was
how
to
combine
new
blood
with
the
old
spirit
and
horace
jewdwine
solved
their
problem
presenting
the
remarkable
combination
of
an
old
head
upon
comparatively
young
shoulders
he
was
responsible
authoritative
inspired
by
a
high
and
noble
seriousness
he
had
taken
his
aristotle
with
a
high
and
noble
seriousness
and
in
the
same
spirit
he
had
approached
his
kant
his
hegel
and
his
schopenhauer
in
succession
he
was
equipped
with
the
most
beautiful
metaphysical
theory
of
art
and
had
himself
written
certain
to
metaphysics
had
preyed
on
jewdwine
like
a
flame
he
was
consumed
with
a
passion
for
unity
the
unity
which
nature
only
strives
after
blindly
furiously
ineffectually
the
unity
barely
reached
by
the
serene
and
luminous
processes
of
thought
the
artist
achieves
it
with
one
stroke
in
him
by
the
twin
acts
of
vision
and
creation
the
worlds
of
nature
and
the
idea
are
made
one
he
leaps
at
a
bound
into
the
very
heart
of
the
absolute
he
alone
can
be
said
to
have
attained
and
this
was
the
point
which
jewdwine
insisted
on
attained
only
by
the
sacrifice
of
his
individuality
thus
jewdwine
in
his
to
as
that
work
could
be
regarded
only
as
a
brutal
and
terrific
challenge
to
the
intellect
the
safer
course
was
to
praise
it
and
it
was
unanimously
praised
nobody
was
able
to
understand
a
word
of
it
except
the
last
chapter
on
individualism
in
modern
art
but
as
criticism
wisely
concentrated
itself
on
this
the
only
comprehensible
portion
of
the
book
jewdwine
who
otherwise
would
have
perished
in
his
own
profundity
actually
achieved
some
journalistic
notoriety
as
a
dealer
in
piquant
paradox
and
vigorous
personalities
jewdwine
was
ambitious
on
the
strength
of
his
he
had
come
up
from
oxford
with
a
remarkable
reputation
which
he
had
every
inducement
to
cherish
and
to
guard
he
was
therefore
the
best
possible
editor
for
such
a
review
as
and
such
a
review
as
was
the
best
possible
instrument
of
his
ambition
his
aim
was
to
preserve
the
tradition
of
the
paper
as
pure
as
on
the
day
when
it
was
given
into
his
hands
he
was
a
little
doubtful
as
to
how
far
young
rickman
would
lend
himself
to
that
however
as
the
fruit
of
jewdwine
meditations
rickman
received
a
note
inviting
him
to
dine
with
the
editor
alone
at
hampstead
jewdwine
whose
health
required
pure
air
had
settled
very
comfortably
in
that
high
suburb
and
as
his
marriage
seemed
likely
to
remain
long
a
matter
for
dubious
reflection
he
had
arranged
that
his
sister
edith
should
keep
house
for
him
in
inviting
rickman
to
dine
at
hampstead
his
intention
was
distinctly
friendly
at
the
same
time
he
was
careful
to
fix
an
evening
when
miss
jewdwine
would
not
be
there
he
was
willing
to
help
rickman
in
every
possible
way
short
of
introducing
him
to
the
ladies
of
his
family
but
before
dinner
was
ended
he
had
to
admit
that
this
precaution
was
excessive
rickman
barring
certain
dreadful
possibilities
of
speech
was
really
by
no
means
unpresentable
he
was
attired
with
perfect
sanity
his
methods
at
the
dinner
table
if
at
all
unusual
erred
on
the
side
of
restraint
rather
than
of
extravagance
he
gave
indications
of
a
certain
curious
personal
refinement
and
in
the
matter
of
wine
he
was
almost
incredibly
abstemious
it
was
the
first
time
that
jewdwine
had
come
to
close
quarters
with
his
disciple
and
with
some
surprise
he
saw
himself
going
through
the
experience
without
a
shock
either
he
had
been
mistaken
in
rickman
or
rickman
had
improved
shy
he
still
was
but
he
had
lost
much
of
his
old
ungovernable
nervousness
and
gave
jewdwine
the
impression
of
an
immense
reserve
he
seemed
to
have
entered
into
some
ennobling
possession
which
raised
him
above
the
region
of
small
confusions
and
excitements
his
eye
when
jewdwine
caught
it
no
longer
struggled
to
escape
but
it
seemed
to
be
held
less
by
him
than
by
its
own
controlling
inner
vision
jewdwine
watched
him
narrowly
it
never
entered
into
his
head
that
what
he
was
watching
was
the
effect
of
three
weeks
intercourse
with
lucia
harden
he
attributed
it
to
rickman
deliverance
from
the
shop
to
be
sure
rickman
did
not
strike
him
as
particularly
happy
but
this
again
he
accounted
for
by
the
depressing
state
of
his
finances
neither
of
them
made
the
most
distant
allusion
to
lucia
jewdwine
was
not
aware
of
the
extent
of
rickman
acquaintance
with
his
cousin
neither
could
he
well
have
conceived
it
and
for
rickman
it
was
not
yet
possible
either
to
speak
or
to
hear
of
lucia
without
pain
it
was
not
until
dinner
was
over
and
rickman
was
no
longer
eating
jewdwine
food
that
they
ventured
on
the
unpleasant
topic
that
lay
before
them
conspicuous
though
untouched
jewdwine
felt
that
as
it
was
impossible
to
ignore
what
had
passed
between
them
since
they
had
last
met
the
only
thing
was
to
refer
to
it
as
casually
as
might
be
by
the
way
rickman
he
said
when
they
were
alone
in
his
study
you
were
quite
right
about
that
library
i
only
wish
you
could
have
let
me
know
a
little
sooner
i
wish
i
had
said
rickman
and
his
tone
implied
that
he
appreciated
the
painfulness
of
the
subject
there
was
a
pause
which
rickman
broke
by
congratulating
jewdwine
on
his
appointment
this
he
did
with
a
very
pretty
diffidence
and
modesty
which
smoothed
over
the
awkwardness
of
the
transition
if
indeed
it
did
not
convey
an
adroit
suggestion
of
the
insignificance
of
all
other

the
editor
still
observing
his
unconscious
candidate
was
very
favourably
impressed
he
laid
before
him
the
views
and
aims
of
yes
he
thought
it
had
a
future
before
it
he
was
going
to
make
it
the
organ
of
philosophic
criticism
as
opposed
to
the
mere

it
would
therefore
be

yes
certainly
it
would
also
be
unpopular
heaven
forbid
that
anything
he
was
concerned
in
should
be
popular
it
was
sufficient
that
it
should
be
impartial
and
incorruptible
its
tone
was
to
be
sober
and
scholarly
but
militant
rickman
gathered
that
its
staff
were
to
be
so
many
defending
the
virtue
of
the
english
language
no
loose
journalistic
phrase
would
be
permitted
in
its
columns
its
articles
besides
being
well
reasoned
would
be
examples
of
the
purity
it
preached
it
was
to
set
its
face
sternly
against
democracy
commercialism
and
decadence
the
disciple
caught
fire
from
the
master
enthusiasm
he
approved
aspired
exulted
his
heart
was
big
with
belief
in
jewdwine
and
his
work
being
innocent
himself
of
any
sordid
taint
he
admired
above
all
things
what
he
called
his
friend
intellectual
chastity
jewdwine
felt
the
truth
of
what
lucia
had
told
him
he
could
count
absolutely
on
rickman
devotion
he
arrived
by
stages
at
the
offer
of
the
rickman
looked
up
with
a
curious
uncomprehending
stare
when
he
clearly
understood
the
proposal
that
was
being
made
to
him
he
flushed
deeply
and
showed
unmistakable
signs
of
agitation
do
you
think
said
jewdwine
discreetly
you
care
to
try
it
for
a
time
i
do
know
i
sure
said
rickman
thoughtfully
well
it
only
an
experiment
i
not
offering
you
anything
permanent
of
course
that
makes
all
the
difference
it
does
if
it
is
good
enough
you
do
understand
me
that
what
would
make
it
all
right
make
what
all
right
my
accepting
if
you
really
only
want
a
i
see
said
jewdwine
to
himself
the
youth
has
tasted
liberty
and
he
objects
to
being
caught
and
caged
the
question
is
said
rickman
sinking
into
thought
again
whether
you
really
want
my
dear
fellow
why
on
earth
should
i
say
so
if
i
did
n
no
only
i
thought
after
the
mess
i
made
of
things
that
none
of
your
family
would
ever
care
to
have
anything
to
do
with
me
again
it
was
the
nearest
he
had
come
to
mentioning
lucia
harden
and
the
pain
it
cost
him
was
visible
on
his
face
my
family
said
jewdwine
with
a
stiff
smile
will
have
anything
to
do
with
you
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
in
that
case
i
do
see
why
i
should
try
it
if
i
can
be
of
any
use
to
you
from
the
calmness
of
his
manner
you
would
have
supposed
that
salaried
appointments
hung
on
every
ready
to
drop
into
the
mouths
of
impecunious
young
men
of
letters
thanks
then
we
consider
that
settled
for
the
present
impossible
to
suppose
that
rickman
was
not
properly
grateful
still
instead
of
thanking
jewdwine
he
had
made
jewdwine
thank
him
and
he
had
done
it
quite
unconsciously
without
any
lapse
from
his
habitual
sincerity
or
the
least
change
in
his
becoming
attitude
of
modesty
jewdwine
considered
that
what
maddox
had
qualified
as
colossal
cheek
was
simply
his
colossal
ignorance
not
to
say
his
insanely
perverted
view
of
the
value
of
salaried
appointments
oh
said
he
i
shall
want
you
as
a
contributor
too
i
do
know
how
you
work
in
with
the
rest
but
we
shall
see
i
wo
have
any
but
picked
men
the
review
has
always
stood
high
but
i
want
it
to
stand
higher
it
is
a
commercial
speculation
there
no
question
of
making
it
pay
it
must
keep
up
its
independence
whether
it
can
afford
it
or
not
we
been
almost
living
on
advertisements
all
the
same
i
mean
to
slaughter
those
new
men
got
hold
of
rickman
admired
this
reckless
policy
it
did
not
occur
to
him
at
the
moment
that
jewdwine
was
reader
to
a
rival
publisher
what
he
said
all
of
them
at
once
no
we
shall
work
them
off
weekly
one
at
a
time
rickman
laughed
one
at
a
time
then
you
allow
them
the
merit
of
individuality
it
is
a
merit
it
a
vice
vice
of
the
age
it
shrieks
it
ramps
individuality
means
slow
disease
in
ethics
and
politics
but
it
sudden
death
to
art
when
will
you
young
men
learn
that
art
is
not
self
expansion
it
seems
an
innocent
impulse
if
it
were
an
impulse
but
it
is
it
a
pose
a
cold
conscious
systematic
pose
so
deadly
artificial
and
so
futile
if
they
did
but
know
after
all
the
individual
is
born
not
made
i
believe
you
yes
but
he
is
born
nowadays
he
belongs
to
the
ages
of
inspired
innocence
and
inspired
energy
we
are
not
inspired
we
are
not
energetic
we
are
not
innocent
we
deliberate
and
languid
and
corrupt
and
we
ca
reproduce
by
our
vile
mechanical
process
what
only
exists
by
the
grace
of
nature
and
of
god
look
at
the
modern
individual
for
all
their
cant
and
rant
is
there
a
more
contemptible
object
on
the
face
of
this
earth
do
talk
to
me
of
individuality
it
given
us
one
or
two
artists
artists
yes
artists
by
the
million
and
no
art
to
produce
art
the
artist
individuality
must
conform
to
the
absolute
jewdwine
in
was
a
man
of
enormous
utterances
and
noble
truths
with
him
all
artistic
achievements
stood
or
fell
according
to
the
canons
of
the
to
therefore
in
his
conversation
was
not
what
you
would
call
diverting
yet
it
made
you
giddy
his
ideas
kept
on
circulating
round
and
round
the
same
icy
invisible
pole
rickman
in
describing
the
interview
afterwards
said
he
thought
he
had
caught
a
cold
in
the
head
talking
to
jewdwine
his
intellect
seemed
to
be
sitting
in
a
thorough
draught
and
if
the
artist
has
a
devil
in
him
if
he
the
sort
of
genius
who
ca
and
wo
conform
strikes
me
the
poor
old
absolute
got
to
climb
down
if
he
a
genius
he
generally
is
he
know
that
he
express
himself
best
by
conforming
he
is
lost
by
it
but
enlarged
look
at
greek
art
there
said
jewdwine
a
rapt
and
visionary
air
passing
over
his
usually
apathetic
face
the
individual
the
artist
is
always
subdued
to
the
universal
the
absolute
beauty
and
in
modern
art
i
take
it
the
universal
absolute
beauty
is
subdued
to
the
individual
that
seems
only
fair
what
you
got
to
reckon
with
is
the
man
himself
who
wants
the
man
himself
we
want
the
thing
itself
the
reality
the
pure
object
of
art
do
any
of
your
new
men
understand
that
we
it
some
of
us
do
you
it
not
i
do
you
understand
it
yourself
would
you
know
it
if
you
met
it
in
the
street
it
never
is
in
the
street
how
do
you
know
you
ca
say
where
it
is
or
what
it
is
you
say
anything
about
it
at
all
but
while
you
all
trying
to
find
out
the
most
unlikely
person
suddenly
gets
up
and
produces
it
and
ca
tell
you
where
he
got
it
though
if
you
ask
him
ten
to
one
he
tell
you
he
been
sitting
on
it
all
the
time
well
said
jewdwine
tell
me
when
you
on
anything
yourself
i
will
he
rose
to
go
being
anxious
to
avoid
the
suspicion
of
having
pushed
that
question
to
a
personal
issue
it
was
only
in
reply
to
more
searching
inquiries
that
he
mentioned
on
the
doorstep
that
a
book
of
his
was
coming
out
in
the
autumn
what
no
and
a
lot
of
things
you
have
seen
yet
it
was
a
rapid
nervous
communication
made
in
the
moment
of
withdrawing
his
hand
from
jewdwine
who
your
publisher
called
out
jewdwine
rickman
laughed
as
the
night
received
him
vaughan
he
shouted
from
the
garden
gate
now
what
on
earth
said
jewdwine
could
have
been
his
motive
for
not
consulting
me
he
had
not
got
the
clue
to
the
hesitation
and
secrecy
of
the
young
man
behaviour
he
did
not
know
that
there
were
three
things
which
rickman
desired
at
any
cost
to
keep
pure
his
genius
his
friendship
for
horace
jewdwine
and
his
love
for
lucia
harden
chapter
xl
the
end
of
may
found
rickman
still
at
downey
established
on
the
second
floor
in
a
glory
that
exceeded
the
glory
of
blenkinsop
he
had
now
not
only
a
bedroom
but
a
study
furnished
with
a
simplicity
that
had
the
effect
of
luxury
and
lined
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
his
books
downey
had
agreed
that
rickman
should
whenever
the
mysterious
fancy
took
him
have
his
meals
served
to
him
in
his
own
apartment
after
the
high
manner
of
blenkinsop
and
it
was
under
protest
that
she
accepted
any
compensation
for
the
break
thus
made
in
the
triumphal
order
of
the
dinner
here
then
at
last
he
was
absolutely
alone
and
free
feeling
perhaps
how
nearly
it
had
lost
him
or
impressed
by
the
sudden
change
in
his
position
the
revered
this
privacy
of
rickman
as
a
sacred
thing
not
even
soper
would
have
dared
to
violate
his
virgin
leisure
the
charm
of
it
was
unbroken
it
was
even
heightened
by
the
inaudible
presence
of
miss
roots
in
her
den
on
the
same
floor
miss
roots
indeed
was
the
tie
that
bound
him
to
downey
otherwise
the
dream
of
his
affluence
would
have
been
chambers
in
westminster
or
the
temple
for
his
income
in
its
leap
from
zero
to
a
fluctuating
two
hundred
a
year
appeared
to
him
as
boundless
affluence
to
be
sure
jewdwine
had
expressly
stated
that
it
would
not
be
permanent
but
this
he
had
understood
to
be
merely
a
delicate
way
of
referring
to
his
former
imperfect
record
of
sobriety
and
he
had
become
rich
not
only
in
money
but
in
time
rickman
had
demanded
an
eight
or
even
a
ten
hours
day
the
office
of
claimed
him
but
five
hours
of
four
days
in
the
week
from
five
on
thursday
evening
till
eleven
on
monday
morning
whatever
work
remained
for
him
to
do
could
be
done
in
his
own
time
and
his
own
temper
much
of
the
leisure
time
at
his
disposal
he
spent
in
endeavouring
to
follow
the
harden
library
in
its
dispersion
he
attended
the
great
auctions
in
the
hope
of
intercepting
some
treasure
in
its
passage
from
rickman
to
the
home
of
the
collector
once
in
his
father
absence
he
bought
a
dozen
volumes
straight
over
the
counter
from
his
successor
there
it
was
also
about
this
time
that
spinks
and
soper
appeared
in
the
new
character
of
book
fanciers
buying
according
to
instructions
and
selling
to
him
on
commission
a
transaction
which
filled
these
gentlemen
with
superb
importance
thus
rickman
became
possessed
of
about
twenty
or
thirty
volumes
which
he
ranged
behind
a
curtain
on
a
shelf
apart
the
collection
formed
gradually
included
nothing
of
any
intrinsic
value
such
as
it
was
he
treasured
it
with
a
view
to
restoring
it
ultimately
to
lucia
harden
he
was
considering
whether
with
the
means
at
his
disposal
he
could
procure
a
certain
aldine
dante
of
his
memory
when
the
harden
library
disappeared
from
the
market
as
suddenly
and
mysteriously
as
it
had
come
no
volume
belonging
to
it
could
be
bought
for
love
or
money
and
none
were
displayed
in
the
windows
of
rickman
keith
learnt
nothing
by
his
inquiries
beyond
the
extent
of
his
estrangement
from
his
father
when
he
called
at
the
shop
his
successor
regretted
that
he
was
unable
to
give
him
any
information
when
he
visited
the
suburban
villa
isaac
refused
to
see
him
when
he
wrote
isaac
never
answered
the
letters
his
stepmother
in
an
unpleasant
interview
gave
him
to
understand
that
the
separation
was
final
and
complete
he
would
have
been
more
hurt
by
this
rupture
but
for
that
other
and
abiding
pain
the
thought
of
lucia
harden
checked
his
enjoyment
in
the
prospect
of
a
now
unimpeded
career
rickman
was
like
some
young
athlete
who
walks
on
to
the
field
stripped
and
strong
for
the
race
but
invisibly
handicapped
having
had
the
heart
knocked
out
of
him
by
some
shameful
incident
outside
the
course
apart
from
his
own
disgrace
he
was
miserably
anxious
about
lucia
herself
about
her
health
her
happiness
her
prospects
his
misery
being
by
no
means
lightened
by
his
perception
that
these
things
were
not
exactly
his
concern
he
tried
to
picture
her
living
as
poor
ladies
live
he
had
seen
them
sometimes
at
downey
he
could
not
see
her
there
or
rather
seeing
her
he
could
see
nothing
else
he
perceived
that
surroundings
and
material
accessories
contributed
nothing
to
his
idea
of
her
still
he
knew
nothing
and
he
had
to
accept
his
ignorance
as
part
and
the
worst
part
of
the
separation
that
was
his
punishment
many
mixed
feelings
shame
and
passion
delicacy
and
pride
restrained
him
from
asking
jewdwine
any
question
even
if
jewdwine
had
not
told
him
as
much
he
would
have
known
that
his
acquaintance
with
affairs
would
not
involve
acquaintance
with
jewdwine
family
he
had
absolutely
nothing
to
hope
for
from
that
connection
and
yet
he
hoped
the
probabilities
were
that
if
lucia
did
not
make
her
home
with
her
cousins
she
would
at
any
rate
stay
with
them
the
greater
part
of
the
year
he
was
always
walking
up
to
hampstead
heath
on
the
chance
of
some
day
seeing
her
there
sometimes
he
would
pass
by
the
front
of
jewdwine
beautiful
old
brown
house
and
glance
quickly
through
the
delicate
iron
gate
and
up
at
the
windows
but
she
was
never
there
sometimes
he
would
sit
for
hours
on
one
of
the
seats
under
the
elm
tree
at
the
back
there
was
a
high
walk
there
overlooking
the
west
heath
and
shaded
by
the
elms
and
by
garden
wall
the
wall
had
a
door
in
it
that
might
some
day
open
and
let
out
the
thing
he
longed
for
only
it
never
did
there
was
nothing
to
hope
for
from
jewdwine
house
at
last
his
longing
became
intolerable
and
one
day
in
the
office
he
made
up
his
mind
to
approach
jewdwine
himself
he
had
been
telling
him
about
the
apparent
check
in
the
career
of
the
harden
library
when
he
saw
his
opportunity
and
took
it
by
the
way
can
you
tell
me
where
your
cousin
is
now
miss
harden
said
jewdwine
coldly
is
in
germany
with
miss
palliser
he
added
as
if
he
evidently
felt
that
some
explanation
was
necessary
not
on
rickman
account
but
on
his
own
she
was
to
have
come
to
us
but
we
were
obliged
to
give
her
up
to
miss
palliser
who
is
living
alone
alone
yes
palliser
is
dead
rickman
turned
abruptly
away
to
the
window
and
stared
into
the
street
below
jewdwine
from
his
seat
by
the
table
looked
after
him
thoughtfully
he
would
have
given
a
good
deal
to
know
what
was
implied
in
the
sudden
turning
of
rickman
back
what
on
earth
did
it
matter
to
rickman
if
old
palliser
was
dead
or
alive
what
could
he
be
thinking
of
he
was
thinking
of
kitty
who
had
shown
him
kindness
of
kitty
and
the
pleasant
jests
with
which
she
used
to
cover
his
embarrassment
of
kitty
who
had
understood
him
at
the
last
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
some
grief
for
the
grief
of
lucia
friend
but
he
had
no
business
to
show
it
therefore
he
had
turned
away
and
then
he
thought
of
lucia
and
in
his
heart
he
cursed
that
other
business
which
was
his
and
yet
not
his
he
cursed
the
making
of
the
catalogue
he
cursed
the
great
harden
library
which
had
brought
them
together
and
divided
them
but
for
that
his
genius
a
thing
apart
might
have
claimed
her
friendship
for
itself
as
it
was
his
genius
being
after
all
bound
up
with
his
person
which
suffered
and
was
ashamed
had
as
far
as
lucia
was
concerned
to
accept
its
humiliation
and
dismissal
and
all
the
time
his
genius
already
vigorous
enough
in
all
conscience
throve
on
his
suffering
as
it
had
thriven
on
his
joy
in
that
summer
of
rickman
were
followed
by
harcombe
and

and
that
greatest
poem
of
his
lyric
period
song
of
upon
the
young
poet
about
town
there
had
descended
as
it
were
out
of
heaven
a
power
hitherto
undreamed
of
and
undivined
no
rapture
of
the
body
was
ever
so
winged
and
flamed
or
lost
itself
in
such
heights
and
depths
of
music
as
that
cry
of
the
passion
of
his
soul
chapter
xli
meanwhile
of
a
sunday
evening
miss
poppy
grace
wondered
why
never
by
any
chance
appeared
upon
his
balcony
at
last
coming
home
about
ten
from
one
of
his
walks
to
hampstead
he
found
poppy
leaning
out
over
balcony
most
unmistakably
on
the
come
in
and
have
some
supper
said
she
no
thanks
i
fancy
it
a
little
late
better
late
than
never
when
it
supper
with
catch
and
poppy
in
defiance
of
all
propriety
tossed
her
over
the
balcony
and
somehow
that
had
to
be
returned
he
did
not
use
it
but
rang
with
the
intention
of
handing
it
to
the
servant
an
intention
divined
and
frustrated
by
poppy
who
opened
the
door
to
him
herself
do
go
away
she
said
i
got
something
to
tell
you
not
now
i
think
her
eyes
were
hideous
to
him
in
their
great
rings
of
paint
and
bistre
why
ever
not
it
only
tyke
a
minute
come
in
there
nobody
up
there
that
matters
and
because
he
had
no
desire
to
be
brutal
or
uncivil
he
went
up
into
the
room
he
knew
so
well
it
being
summer
the
folding
doors
were
thrown
wide
open
and
in
the
room
beyond
they
came
upon
a
large
lady
in
a
dirty
eating
lobster
for
poppy
now
that
she
saw
respectability
departing
from
her
held
out
to
it
a
pathetic
little
hand
and
the
pending
an
engagement
as
heavy
matron
on
the
provincial
stage
was
glad
enough
to
play
propriety
in
miss
poppy
made
short
work
of
propriety
she
waited
with
admirable
patience
while
the
large
lady
whom
she
addressed
affectionately
as
tiny
followed
up
the
last
thin
trail
of
mayonnaise
but
when
tiny
showed
a
disposition
to
toy
with
the
intricacies
of
an
empty
claw
poppy
protested
hurry
up
and
clear
out
there
a
dear
i
want
to
give
rickets
his
supper
and
we
have
got
a
minute
to
spare
and
tiny
who
seemed
to
know
her
business
hurried
up
and
cleared
out
but
rickets
did
want
any
supper
and
poppy
was
visibly
abstracted
and
depressed
she
mingled
whipped
cream
with
minute
fragments
of
lobster
and
finally
fell
to
torturing
a
sandwich
with
a
spoon
and
all
with
an
immense
affectation
of
not
having
a
minute
to
spare
well
ryzors
she
said
at
last
and
her
accent
jarred
him
horribly
this
is
very
strynge
behyviour
which
which
do
you
know
you
have
been
near
me
for
two
months
he
laughed
uneasily
i
could
be
near
you
when
i
was
away
never
said
you
could
but
what
did
you
go
away
for
business
too
busy
to
write
i
suppose
much
too
busy
she
rose
and
with
one
hand
on
his
shoulder
steered
him
into
the
front
room
sit
down
she
said
and
do
look
so
sulky
i
want
to
talk
to
you
sensibly
he
sat
down
where
he
had
sat
that
night
two
months
ago
on
the
polar
bear
skin
she
sat
down
too
with
a
sweeping
movement
of
her
hips
that
drew
her
thin
skirts
close
about
her
she
contemplated
the
effect
a
little
dubiously
then
with
shy
nervous
fingers
loosened
and
shook
out
the
folds
he
leaned
back
withdrawn
as
far
as
possible
into
the
corner
of
the
divan
the
associations
of
the
place
were
unspeakably
loathsome
to
him
look
here
dear
in
poppy
world
the
term
of
endearment
went
for
nothing
it
was
simply
the
stamp
upon
the
current
coin
of
comradeship
if
only
that
had
been
the
beginning
and
the
end
between
them
i
have
a
minute
but
i
going
to
ask
you
something
though
poppy
had
a
minute
she
was
applying
herself
very
leisurely
to
the
making
of
cigarettes
do
go
and
get
huffy
at
what
i
going
to
say
do
you
happen
to
owe
dicky
anything
why
tell
you
why
afterwards
you
owe
him
anything
oh
well
a
certain
amount
why
why
because
i
think
he
owes
something
and
that
a
grudge
it
is
my
business
but
if
i
were
you
rickets
i
pay
him
orf
and
have
done
with
him
oh
that
all
right
i
safe
enough
you
it
just
you
who
is
dicky
not
a
bad
sort
in
his
way
all
the
same
he
sell
you
up
as
soon
as
look
at
you
unless
for
a
moment
her
bright
eyes
clouded
charged
with
the
melancholy
meanings
of
the
world
unless
you
happened
to
be
an
pretty
woman
she
laid
her
right
leg
across
her
left
knee
and
struck
a
vesta
on
the
heel
of
her
shoe
then
of
course
he
sooner
look
at
me
poppy
puffed
at
her
cigarette
and
threw
the
vesta
into
the
grate
with
a
dexterous
jerk
of
her
white
forearm
look
at
you
first
sell
you
up
after
then
poppy
burst
into
song
oh
he
is
such
a
nice
little
boy
when
there
nothing
you
do
to
annoy
but
he
apt
to
stand
aloof
if
you
arsk
him
for
the
oof
and
it
then
that
he
looks
coy
oh
he
show
the
cloven
hoof
if
you
put
him
to
the
proof
when
you
want
him
to
hand
you
the
boodle
he
such
a
nice
little
boy
yes
dickee
see
you
the
canary
persuaded
by
poppy
song
that
it
was
broad
daylight
was
awake
and
splashing
in
his
bath
again
in
poppy
mind
how
unnecessarily
he
stood
for
the
respectabilities
and
proprieties
he
was
an
understudy
for
tiny
of
the
dirty
going
yes
i
must
go
wait
she
rose
and
held
him
by
the
collar
of
his
coat
a
lapel
in
each
small
hand
he
grasped
her
wrists
by
an
instinctive
movement
of
and
gently
slackened
her
hold
she
gave
his
coat
a
little
shake
what
the
matter
with
you
rickets
you
such
a
howling
swell
her
eyes
twinkled
in
the
old
way
and
he
smiled
in
spite
of
himself
say
i
a
little
nuisance
rickets
i
a
little
nuisance
you
are
a
little
nuisance
a
d
d
little
nuisance
a
d
d
little
nuisance
ah
now
you
feel
better
do
you
poor
do
you
be
afraid
it
only
a
nuisance
it
never
be
a
big
one
done
growing
that
is
i
wo
rag
you
any
more
if
you
tell
me
one
thing
oh
what
a
whopper
of
a
sigh
promise
me
you
pay
dicky
off
all
right
i
pay
him
then
do
poppy
i
i
got
a
sore
throat
for
poppy
standing
on
had
made
an
effort
to
embrace
him
i
sy
if
you
blush
like
that
rickets
you
have
a
fit
poor
dear
i
crumple
his
nice
little
stylish
collar
he
endured
while
she
smoothed
out
an
imaginary
wrinkle
her
head
very
much
on
one
side
you
see
razors
we
been
such
chums
whatever
happens
i
want
to
be
all
right
and
straight
with
you
what
should
happen
oh
anything
again
there
was
that
troubling
of
the
bright
shallows
of
her
eyes
you
remember
larst
time
you
were
here
his
shudder
told
her
that
he
remembered
well
i
try
to
send
you
away
did
i
as
far
as
i
can
remember
you
did
what
did
you
think
i
did
it
for
i
suppose
because
you
wanted
me
to
go
stupid
i
did
it
because
i
wanted
you
to
she
looked
into
his
eyes
and
the
light
went
out
of
her
own
among
its
paint
and
powder
her
audacity
lay
dead
it
was
as
if
she
saw
on
his
face
the
shadow
of
lucia
harden
and
knew
that
her
hour
had
come
she
met
it
laughing
as
he
took
her
hand
he
muttered
something
about
being
fearfully
sorry
sorry
poppy
conjured
up
a
poor
flickering
ghost
of
her
inimitable
wink
the
champagne
was
bad
dear
do
you
worry
when
he
had
left
her
she
flung
herself
face
downwards
on
the
divan
oh
dicky
will
you
hold
your
horrid
little
tongue
but
as
she
sobbed
aloud
the
canary
symbol
of
invincible
propriety
rocked
on
his
perch
and
shook
over
her
his
piercing
and
exultant
song
rickman
was
sorry
for
her
but
the
sight
and
touch
of
her
were
hateful
to
him
he
took
her
advice
however
he
had
had
good
luck
with
some
articles
and
he
called
on
pilkington
the
next
afternoon
and
paid
him
his
thirty
pounds
with
the
interest
dicky
was
in
a
good
humour
and
inclined
to
be
communicative
he
congratulated
him
on
his
present
berth
and
informed
him
that
rickman
was
going
it
the
old
man
had
just
raised
four
thousand
on
the
harden
library
the
only
security
that
he
dicky
would
accept
i
suppose
said
rickman
simply
you
no
idea
of
its
value
when
you
let
him
buy
it
dicky
stared
through
his
with
his
blue
eyes
immense
and
clear
my
dear
fellow
do
you
take
me
for
a
d
d
fool
so
that
had
been
dicky
little
game
trust
dicky
and
yet
for
the
time
being
held
in
the
opposing
grip
of
two
firm
cupidities
it
was
safe
the
great
harden
library
once
the
joy
of
scholars
loved
with
such
high
intellectual
passion
and
now
the
centre
of
so
many
hot
schemes
and
rivalries
and
lusts
now
that
the
work
of
sacrilege
was
complete
housed
at
last
in
the
gin
palace
of
art
it
stood
useless
in
its
desecrated
beauty
cumbering
the
shelves
whence
no
sale
would
remove
it
until
either
rickman
or
pilkington
let
go
so
far
the
hardens
were
avenged
chapter
xlii
more
than
once
after
that
night
when
rickman
dined
with
him
jewdwine
became
the
prey
of
many
misgivings
he
felt
that
in
taking
rickman
up
he
was
assuming
an
immense
responsibility
it
might
have
been
better
happier
for
rickman
poor
fellow
if
after
all
he
had
left
him
in
his
decent
obscurity
but
having
dragged
him
out
of
it
he
was
in
a
manner
answerable
to
the
world
for
rickman
and
to
rickman
for
the
world
supposing
rickman
disappointed
the
world
supposing
the
world
disappointed
rickman
jewdwine
lived
in
the
hope
natural
to
a
distinguished
critic
of
some
day
lighting
upon
a
genius
the
glory
of
that
find
would
go
far
to
compensate
him
for
his
daily
traffic
with
mediocrity
genius
was
rarely
to
be
seen
but
jewdwine
felt
that
he
would
be
the
first
to
recognize
it
if
he
did
see
it
the
first
to
penetrate
its
many
curious
disguises
the
first
to
give
it
an
introduction
if
it
wanted
one
to
his
own
superior
world
and
here
was
rickman
manifestly
in
need
of
that
introduction
a
man
who
unquestionably
had
about
him
some
of
the
marks
by
which
a
genius
is
identified
and
yet
he
left
you
terribly
uncertain
he
was
the
very
incarnation
of
uncertainty
jewdwine
was
perfectly
willing
to
help
the
man
if
only
he
were
sure
of
the
genius
but
was
he
sure
had
it
really
pleased
the
inscrutable
divine
thing
to
take
up
its
abode
in
this
otherwise
rather
impossible
person
meanwhile
rickman
seemed
to
be
settling
down
fairly
comfortably
to
the
work
of
and
jewdwine
having
other
things
to
think
of
began
to
forget
his
existence
he
was
in
fact
rapidly
realizing
his
dream
he
had
won
for
himself
and
his
paper
a
position
lonely
and
unique
the
reputation
of
was
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
circulation
but
jewdwine
was
making
himself
heard
as
an
editor
and
critic
he
was
respected
for
his
incorruptibility
and
for
the
purity
of
his
passion
for
literature
his
utterances
were
considered
to
carry
authority
and
weight
just
at
first
the
weight
was
perhaps
the
more
conspicuous
quality
of
the
two
jewdwine
could
not
be
parted
from
his
absolute
he
had
lived
with
it
for
years
in
oxford
and
he
brought
it
up
to
town
with
him
it
walked
beside
him
on
the
london
pavements
and
beckoned
him
incessantly
into
the
vast
inane
it
cut
a
very
majestic
figure
in
his
columns
till
some
irritable
compositor
docked
it
of
its
capital
and
compelled
it
to
march
with
the
rank
and
file
of
vulgar
adjectives
even
thus
degraded
it
ruled
his
paragraphs
as
it
ruled
his
thoughts
but
lately
the
review
seemed
to
be
making
efforts
to
redeem
itself
from
the
charge
of
heaviness
in
certain
of
its
columns
there
was
a
curious
radiance
and
agitation
as
of
some
winged
and
luminous
creature
struggling
against
obscurity
and
it
was
felt
that
jewdwine
was
binding
in
a
pious
tradition
of
dulness
a
spirit
that
would
otherwise
have
danced
and
flown
whether
it
was
his
own
spirit
or
somebody
else
did
not
definitely
appear
but
now
and
again
it
broke
loose
altogether
and
then
when
people
complimented
him
on
the
brilliance
of
his
appearance
that
week
he
smiled
inscrutably
it
was
impossible
to
say
how
far
jewdwine
conscience
approved
of
these
outbursts
of
individuality
certainly
he
did
his
best
to
restrain
them
his
desire
being
to
give
to
his
columns
a
distinguished
unity
of
form
he
saw
himself
the
founder
of
a
new
and
higher
school
of
journalism
thus
satisfying
his
undying
tutorial
instincts
he
had
chosen
his
staff
from
the
most
promising
among
the
young
band
of
disciples
who
thronged
his
at
oxford
men
moulded
on
his
methods
inspired
by
his
ideals
drenched
in
his
metaphysics
crude
young
men
of
uncontrollable
enthusiasm
whose
style
awaited
at
his
hands
the
final
polishing
he
knew
that
he
had
done
a
risky
thing
in
associating
young
rickman
with
them
in
this
high
enterprise
but
under
all
his
doubts
there
lay
a
faith
in
the
genius
of
his
a
faith
the
more
fascinating
because
it
was
so
far
removed
from
any
certainty
in
giving
rickman
his
present
post
he
conceived
himself
not
only
to
be
paying
a
debt
of
honour
but
doing
the
best
possible
thing
for
it
was
also
he
considered
the
best
possible
thing
for
rickman
his
work
on
the
review
would
give
him
the
discipline
he
most
needed
the
discipline
he
had
never
had
to
be
brought
into
line
with
an
august
tradition
to
be
caught
up
out
of
the
slough
of
modern
journalism
into
a
rarer
atmosphere
to
breathe
the
eternal
spirit
of
great
literature
a
spirit
which
according
to
jewdwine
did
not
blow
altogether
where
it
listed
to
have
his
too
exuberant
individuality
chastened
and
controlled
would
be
for
rickman
an
unspeakable
benefit
at
this
critical
stage
of
his
career
the
chastening
and
controlling
were
difficult
rickman
phrases
were
frequently
more
powerful
than
polite
like
many
young
writers
of
violent
imagination
he
was
apt
to
be
somewhat
vividly
erotic
in
his
metaphors
and
he
had
little
ways
that
were
very
irritating
to
jewdwine
he
was
wasteful
with
the
office
paper
and
with
string
he
would
use
penny
stamps
where
halfpenny
ones
would
have
served
his
purpose
he
had
once
permitted
himself
to
differ
with
jewdwine
on
a
point
of
scholarship
in
the
presence
of
the
junior
clerk
there
were
times
when
jewdwine
longed
to
turn
him
out
and
have
done
with
him
and
yet
rickman
stayed
on
when
all
was
said
and
done
there
was
a
charm
about
him
jewdwine
in
fact
had
proved
the
truth
of
lucia
saying
he
could
rely
absolutely
on
his
devotion
he
could
not
afford
to
let
him
go
though
rickman
tampered
shamelessly
with
the
traditions
of
the
review
it
could
not
be
said
that
as
yet
he
had
injured
its
circulation
his
contributions
were
noticed
with
approval
in
rival
columns
and
they
had
even
been
quoted
by
continental
critics
with
whom
passed
as
being
the
only
british
review
that
had
the
true
interests
of
literature
at
heart
but
though
rickman
helped
to
bring
fame
to
brought
none
to
him
the
identity
of
its
contributors
was
merged
in
that
of
its
editor
and
those
brilliant
articles
were
never
signed
the
spring
of
which
found
jewdwine
comfortably
seated
on
the
summit
of
his
ambition
saw
rickman
almost
as
obscure
as
in
the
spring
of
his
poems
had
not
yet
appeared
vaughan
evidently
regarded
them
as
so
many
sensitive
plants
and
fearing
for
them
the
boisterous
seasons
of
autumn
and
spring
had
kept
them
back
till
the
coming
may
when
as
he
expressed
it
the
market
would
be
less
crowded
this
delay
gave
time
to
that
erratic
artist
mordaunt
crawley
to
complete
the
remarkable
illustrations
on
which
vaughan
relied
chiefly
for
success
vaughan
had
spared
no
expense
but
naturally
it
was
the
artist
and
the
printer
not
the
poet
whom
he
paid
rickman
however
had
not
thought
of
his
as
a
source
of
revenue
it
had
been
such
a
pleasure
to
write
them
that
the
wonder
was
he
had
not
been
called
upon
to
pay
for
that
happily
for
him
he
was
by
this
time
independent
as
and
contributor
to
he
was
drawing
two
small
but
regular
incomes
he
could
also
count
on
a
third
smaller
and
more
uncertain
from
where
from
the
moment
of
his
capture
by
jewdwine
he
had
been
reinstated
he
found
it
easy
enough
to
work
for
both
was
poor
and
it
was
out
of
sheer
perversity
that
it
indulged
a
disinterested
passion
for
literature
in
fact
maddox
and
his
men
were
trying
to
do
with
gaiety
of
heart
what
jewdwine
was
doing
with
superb
solemnity
but
whenever
rickman
mentioned
maddox
to
jewdwine
jewdwine
would
shrug
his
shoulders
and
say
maddox
is
not
important
and
when
he
mentioned
to
maddox
maddox
would
correct
him
with
a
laugh
the
museum
you
mean
and
refer
to
his
as
a
respectable
collection
of
meiocene
fossils
maddox
had
conceived
a
jealous
and
violent
admiration
for
savage
keith
rickman
rickman
he
said
you
shall
not
go
over
body
and
soul
to
he
regarded
himself
as
the
keeper
and
lover
of
rickman
soul
and
would
not
have
been
sorry
to
bring
about
a
divorce
between
it
and
jewdwine
his
irregular
attentions
were
to
save
it
from
a
suicidal
devotion
to
a
joyless
consort
so
that
rickman
was
torn
between
maddox
enthusiasm
for
him
and
his
own
enthusiasm
for
jewdwine
that
affection
endured
being
one
with
his
impetuous
and
generous
youth
while
his
genius
that
thing
alone
and
apart
escaped
from
jewdwine
he
knew
that
jewdwine
incorruptibility
left
him
nothing
to
expect
in
the
way
of
approval
and
protection
and
the
knowledge
did
not
greatly
affect
him
he
preferred
that
his
friend
should
remain
incorruptible
that
jewdwine
should
greatly
delight
in
his
was
more
than
he
at
any
time
expected
for
there
his
muse
modernity
had
begun
to
turn
her
back
resolutely
on
the
masters
and
the
models
to
fling
off
the
golden
fetters
of
rhyme
gird
up
her
draperies
to
her
naked
thighs
and
step
out
with
her
great
swinging
stride
on
perilous
paths
of
her
own
to
be
sure
there
were
other
things
which
jewdwine
had
not
seen
on
which
he
himself
felt
that
he
might
rest
a
pretty
secure
claim
to
immortality
of
his
progress
thither
his
friends
had
to
accept
announcements
as
the
only
intimation
rickman
had
not
called
upon
any
of
the
junior
journalists
to
smooth
the
way
for
him
he
had
not
in
fact
called
on
any
of
them
at
all
but
as
april
advanced
he
retreated
more
and
more
into
a
foolish
privacy
and
with
the
approaches
of
may
he
vanished
one
night
however
some
junior
journalists
caught
him
at
the
club
belated
eating
supper
they
afterwards
recalled
that
he
had
then
seemed
to
them
possessed
by
a
perfect
demon
of
indiscretion
and
when
his
book
finally
appeared
on
the
first
of
may
it
was
felt
that
it
could
hardly
have
been
produced
under
more
unfavourable
auspices
this
reckless
attitude
was
evidently
unaffected
nobody
had
ever
accused
rickman
of
affectation
and
even
maddox
pronounced
it
imprudent
in
the
extreme
as
for
jewdwine
it
could
not
be
accounted
for
by
any
motives
known
to
him
his
experience
compelled
him
to
take
a
somewhat
cynical
view
of
the
literary
character
jewdwine
among
his
authors
was
like
a
man
insusceptible
of
passion
but
aware
of
the
fascinations
that
caused
him
to
be
pursued
by
the
solicitations
of
the
fair
he
was
flattered
by
the
pursuit
but
the
pursuer
inspired
him
with
the
liveliest
contempt
it
had
not
yet
occurred
to
him
that
rickman
could
have
any
delicacy
in
approaching
him
still
less
could
he
believe
that
rickman
could
be
indifferent
to
the
fate
of
his
book
his
carelessness
therefore
did
not
strike
him
as
entirely
genuine
there
could
be
no
doubt
however
as
to
the
genuineness
of
surprise
when
he
came
upon
jewdwine
in
the
office
reading
he
smiled
upon
him
innocent
and
unconscious
ah
he
said
so
you
reading
it
you
wo
like
it
jewdwine
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
and
it
was
wonderful
the
amount
of
annoyance
he
managed
to
convey
by
the
gesture
his
face
too
wore
a
worried
and
uncertain
look
so
worried
and
so
uncertain
that
rickman
was
sorry
for
him
he
felt
he
must
make
it
easy
for
him
at
any
rate
you
wo
admire
its
personal
appearance
i
do
what
possessed
you
to
give
it
to
vaughan
some
devil
i
think
you
certainly
might
have
done
better
perhaps
if
i
taken
the
trouble
but
i
did
jewdwine
raised
his
eyebrows
whenever
he
did
that
rickman
thought
of
someone
who
used
to
raise
her
eyebrows
too
but
with
a
difference
you
see
it
was
last
year
i
let
things
slide
jewdwine
looked
as
if
he
did
see
if
you
had
come
to
me
i
think
i
could
have
helped
you
i
did
want
to
bother
you
i
knew
you
would
care
for
the
things
well
frankly
i
do
care
very
much
for
some
of
them
but
i
should
have
stretched
a
point
to
keep
you
clear
of
crawley
i
sorry
he
put
temptation
in
your
way
he
did
they
say
i
put
temptation
in
his
way
horrid
is
it
to
think
there
something
in
me
that
appeals
to
his
diseased
imagination
it
a
pity
and
i
do
know
what
i
can
do
for
you
you
see
identified
yourself
with
a
school
i
particularly
abominate
it
is
a
school
a
school
implies
a
master
and
some
attempt
at
discipline
it
should
have
a
formula
crawley
has
none
oh
i
do
know
about
that
he
stood
beside
jewdwine
who
was
gazing
at
the
frontispiece
talk
about
absolute
beauty
any
fool
can
show
you
the
beauty
of
a
beautiful
thing
or
the
ugliness
of
an
ugly
one
but
it
takes
a
clever
beast
like
crawley
to
show
you
beauty
in
anything
so
absolutely
repulsive
as
that
woman
face
look
at
it
he
got
hold
of
something
he
caught
the
lurking
fascination
the
the
leer
of
life
jewdwine
made
a
gesture
of
disgust
of
course
it
no
good
as
an
illustration
i
do
see
life
with
a
leer
on
its
face
but
he
can
draw
look
at
the
fellow
line
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
the
purity
of
it
it
a
high
and
holy
abstraction
by
jove
he
got
formula
pure
line
remains
pure
however
bestial
the
object
it
describes
i
wish
he
drawn
it
at
illustrating
but
i
suppose
if
he
saw
it
that
way
he
had
to
draw
it
that
way
jewdwine
turned
over
the
pages
gingerly
as
if
he
feared
to
be
polluted
he
was
at
the
moment
profoundly
sorry
for
rickman
in
this
marriage
of
his
art
with
mordaunt
crawley
whatever
might
be
said
of
rickman
radiant
and
impetuous
genius
it
neither
lurked
nor
leered
it
was
in
no
way
represented
by
that
strange
and
shameless
figure
half
mænad
half
modern
courtesan
the
face
foreshortened
tilted
back
in
the
act
of
emptying
a
at
any
rate
said
rickman
he
has
lied
he
had
the
courage
to
be
his
filthy
self
still
the
result
is
exactly
a
flattering
portrait
of
your
muse
she
a
caution
it
quite
enough
to
make
you
and
hanson
lump
me
with
letheby
and
that
lot
this
touched
jewdwine
in
two
sensitive
places
at
once
he
objected
to
being
lumped
with
hanson
he
also
felt
that
his
generosity
had
been
called
in
question
for
a
moment
the
truth
that
was
in
him
looked
out
of
his
grave
and
earnest
eyes
i
do
lump
you
with
letheby
or
anybody
on
the
contrary
i
think
you
stand
by
yourself
quite
one
half
of
this
book
is
great
poetry
you
really
think
that
yes
said
jewdwine
solemnly
i
do
think
it
that
why
i
deplore
the
appearance
of
the
other
half
but
if
you
to
publish
why
could
you
bring
out
your
in
it
was
far
finer
than
anything
you
have
here
yes
helen
all
right
his
tone
implied
only
too
plainly
that
she
was
not
all
right
when
jewdwine
had
approved
of
her
what
on
earth
have
you
been
doing
to
her
only
putting
a
little
life
into
her
limbs
but
vaughan
would
have
her
at
any
price
my
dear
rickman
you
should
have
come
to
i
hope
to
goodness
vaughan
wo
tempt
you
into
any
more
after
all
what
wrong
with
them
jewdwine
leaned
back
keenly
alive
to
these
stirrings
of
dissent
he
withdrew
as
it
were
his
protecting
presence
a
foot
or
two
farther
he
spoke
slowly
and
with
emphasis
excess
said
he
too
much
of
everything
too
much
force
too
much
fire
and
too
much
smoke
with
your
fire
in
other
words
too
much
temperament
too
much
rickman
too
much
rickman
yes
far
too
much
it
nothing
but
a
flaming
orgy
of
individuality
and
that
why
it
all
wrong
he
really
wondered
whether
there
might
not
be
something
in
that
view
after
all
it
seems
so
to
me
look
here
my
dear
fellow
because
a
poet
happens
to
have
been
drunk
once
or
twice
in
his
life
it
no
reason
why
he
should
write
a
poem
called
that
sort
of
exhibition
you
know
is
scandalous
rickman
hung
his
head
that
one
poem
he
would
have
given
anything
at
the
moment
to
recall
it
scandalous
if
you
came
to
think
of
it
only
in
the
joy
of
writing
it
he
had
not
thought
of
it
that
was
all
it
simply
astounding
in
a
splendid
scholar
like
you
rickman
such
an
awful
waste
he
looked
at
him
as
he
spoke
and
his
soul
was
in
his
eyes
it
gave
him
a
curious
likeness
to
his
cousin
and
in
that
moment
rickman
worshipped
him
go
back
go
back
to
your
virgil
and
your
homer
and
your
sophocles
and
learn
a
little
more
restraint
there
nothing
like
them
they
take
you
out
of
this
ugly
weary
modern
world
where
you
and
i
rickman
had
no
business
to
be
born
and
yet
said
rickman
there
modern
poets
there
are
very
few
and
those
not
the
greatest
by
modern
i
mean
inspired
by
the
modern
spirit
and
the
modern
spirit
does
not
inspire
great
poetry
the
greatest
have
been
obliged
to
go
back
back
to
primeval
nature
back
to
the
middle
ages
back
to
greece
and
rome
but
always
back
i
ca
go
back
said
rickman
i
may
know
what
i
working
for
yet
but
i
believe
i
on
the
right
road
how
can
i
go
back
why
not
milton
went
back
to
the
creation
and
was
only
born
in
the
seventeenth
century
you
have
had
the
unspeakable
misfortune
to
be
born
in
the
nineteenth
you
must
live
on
your
imagination
the
world
has
nothing
for
you
i
believe
it
something
for
me
if
i
could
only
find
it
well
do
lose
too
much
time
in
looking
for
it
art
long
and
life
short
especially
modern
life
and
that
the
trouble
rickman
shook
his
head
no
that
not
the
trouble
it
the
other
way
about
life
infinite
and
art
one
and
at
first
you
know
the
infinity
that
staggers
you
he
flung
himself
into
a
chair
opposite
jewdwine
planted
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
propped
his
chin
on
his
hands
he
looked
as
if
he
saw
the
infinity
he
spoke
of
i
ca
describe
to
you
he
said
what
it
is
merely
to
be
alive
out
there
in
the
streets
on
a
sunny
day
when
the
air
all
fine
watery
gold
and
goes
dancing
and
singing
into
your
head
like
dry
champagne
i
given
up
alcohol
it
is
really
necessary
i
got
as
drunk
as
a
lord
the
other
day
going
over
hampstead
heath
in
a
west
wind
he
drunk
at
the
mere
thought
of
it
does
it
ever
affect
in
that
way
jewdwine
smiled
the
wind
on
hampstead
heath
had
never
affected
him
in
that
way
no
it
is
what
you
think
i
used
to
go
mad
about
women
just
as
i
used
to
drink
i
do
seem
to
care
a
rap
about
them
now
but
his
eyes
had
a
peculiar
large
and
brilliant
look
as
if
he
saw
the
woman
of
his
desire
approaching
him
his
voice
softened
do
you
know
when
the
world
all
the
divine
maddening
beauty
of
it
lies
naked
before
your
eyes
and
you
want
to
get
hold
of
it
now
this
minute
and
instead
it
gets
hold
of
you
and
pulls
you
every
way
at
once
do
you
know
the
thing
got
a
thousand
faces
and
two
thousand
arms
and
ten
thousand
devils
in
it
jewdwine
did
know
how
should
he
he
had
a
horror
of
this
forcing
of
the
sensuous
and
passionate
note
the
author
of
the
to
recoiled
from
too
much
temperament
he
felt
moreover
the
jealous
pang
of
the
master
who
realizes
that
he
has
lost
his
hold
this
was
not
that
rickman
who
used
to
hang
all
flushed
and
fervid
on
jewdwine
words
he
remembered
how
once
on
an
april
day
a
year
ago
the
disciple
had
turned
at
the
call
of
woman
and
of
the
world
the
call
of
the
spring
in
his
heart
and
in
his
urgent
blood
and
yet
this
was
not
that
rickman
either
my
dear
rickman
i
do
understand
are
you
talking
about
the
world
or
the
flesh
or
the
devils
all
of
them
if
you
like
and
you
can
throw
in
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
too
there
are
moments
jewdwine
when
i
understand
god
at
any
rate
i
know
how
he
felt
the
very
day
before
creation
his
world
all
raw
chaos
to
me
and
i
got
to
make
my
world
out
of
it
i
afraid
i
can
not
help
you
as
they
parted
he
felt
that
perhaps
he
had
failed
to
be
sufficiently
sympathetic
i
do
my
best
said
he
to
set
you
right
with
the
public
left
alone
he
stood
staring
earnestly
at
the
chair
where
rickman
had
sat
propping
his
chin
in
his
hands
he
seemed
to
be
contemplating
his
phantom
the
phantom
that
had
begun
to
haunt
him
what
had
he
let
himself
in
for
chapter
xliii
there
was
one
man
who
was
sure
perfectly
sure
and
that
man
was
maddox
he
had
read
rickman
book
before
jewdwine
had
seen
it
and
while
jewdwine
was
still
shaking
his
head
over
it
in
the
office
of
the
its
chances
were
being
eagerly
discussed
in
the
office
of
maddox
was
disgusted
with
the
publishers
stables
with
the
price
rankin
with
the
illustrations
it
all
very
well
said
rankin
but
those
borrowed
plumes
will
have
to
be
paid
for
borrowed
plumes
with
a
vengeance
said
maddox
vaughan
might
just
as
well
have
turned
him
out
tarred
and
feathered
as
illustrated
by
mordaunt
crawley
mind
you
some
of
that
tar
will
stick
it
take
him
all
his
time
to
get
it
off
did
you
see
said
stables
that
hanson
bracketed
him
with
letheby
in
this
morning
no
did
he
said
maddox
i
sorry
for
that
it
rough
on
little
rickman
it
what
you
must
expect
said
rankin
if
you
illustrated
by
crawley
it
what
you
must
expect
said
stables
if
you
go
out
of
your
way
to
offend
people
who
can
help
you
you
know
he
refused
an
introduction
to
hanson
the
other
day
no
fact
and
it
was
in
his
sublimest
manner
he
said
he
had
any
use
for
hanson
hanson
could
help
him
till
he
helped
himself
i
know
whether
any
one
was
kind
enough
to
tell
that
tale
to
hanson
hanson
said
maddox
is
too
big
a
man
to
mind
it
if
they
did
anyhow
he
helped
him
no
said
rankin
but
that
another
story
hanson
was
dining
with
jewdwine
and
jewdwine
was
cracking
up
rickman
most
extravagantly
for
him
that
was
quite
enough
to
make
hanson
jump
on
him
he
was
bound
to
do
it
by
way
of
asserting
his
independence
i
wonder
if
jewdwine
calculated
that
that
would
be
the
natural
effect
oh
come
he
a
subtle
beast
but
i
do
suppose
he
as
subtle
as
all
that
you
find
that
all
the
reviews
will
follow
hanson
like
a
flock
of
sheep
how
about
the
mackinnon
was
friendly
maddox
smiled
he
was
but
our
alienated
mackinnon
on
the
very
eve
of
publication
how
by
some
awful
jest
something
about
mackinnon
head
and
the
dome
of
the
british
museum
well
if
it
was
a
joke
mackinnon
would
see
it
no
but
he
feel
it
which
would
be
a
great
deal
worse
our
is
devoid
of
common
prudence
our
is
a
d
d
fool
said
stables
well
said
rankin
i
suppose
he
knows
what
he
about
he
got
jewdwine
at
his
back
maddox
shrugged
his
enormous
shoulders
jewdwine
jewdwine
slate
his
own
man
but
he
ca
very
well
turn
round
and
boom
the
set
he
always
goes
for
this
said
maddox
is
my
deal
i
shall
sail
in
and
discover
he
taking
precious
good
care
to
hide
himself
it
a
thousand
pities
he
ever
got
in
with
those
wretched
decadents
he
is
in
with
them
well
he
may
be
exactly
immersed
but
the
tide
caught
him
the
tide
you
might
be
talking
of
the
atlantic
the
stream
then
the
stream
of
tendency
that
makes
for
muck
it
is
a
stream
it
a
filthy
in
somebody
back
yard
there
just
enough
water
for
the
rest
to
drown
in
but
it
is
deep
enough
to
float
a
man
of
rickman
size
he
only
got
his
feet
wet
and
that
wo
hurt
him
there
are
things
said
rankin
in
saturnalia
that
lend
themselves
to
crawley
treatment
and
there
are
things
in
it
that
crawley
ca
touch
and
look
at
the
later
poems
the
four
winds
on
harcombe
hill
and
the
song
of
confession
good
god
it
makes
my
blood
boil
to
compare
the
man
who
wrote
that
with
letheby
letheby
i
could
wring
vaughan
neck
and
hanson
too
i
should
like
to
take
their
heads
and
knock
them
together
as
for
letheby
i
do
for
him
i
smash
him
in
one
column
and
i
give
rickman
his
in
four
the
planet
in
those
early
days
was
liberal
with
its
space
after
all
he
added
in
a
calmer
tone
he
was
right
we
ca
help
him
except
by
taking
a
back
seat
and
letting
him
speak
for
himself
i
shall
quote
freely
the
song
of
confession
is
the
best
answer
to
hanson
it
seems
to
me
said
stables
you
want
a
whole
number
at
this
rate
i
shall
want
six
columns
if
i
to
do
him
any
justice
said
maddox
rising
poor
beggar
i
expect
he
a
bit
off
colour
i
shall
go
and
look
him
up
at
eight
that
evening
he
went
and
looked
him
up
he
found
him
in
his
room
tranquilly
reading
thinking
of
him
as
a
man
of
genius
who
had
courted
failure
and
madly
fooled
away
his
chances
and
seeing
him
sitting
there
so
detached
and
so
unconscious
maddox
was
profoundly
moved
he
had
come
with
cursing
and
with
consolation
with
sympathy
with
prophecy
with
voluble
belief
but
all
he
could
say
was
all
right
rickman
it
great
my
son
it
great
all
the
same
he
did
not
conceal
his
doubts
as
to
the
sort
of
reception
rickman
had
to
expect
that
part
of
the
business
he
said
had
been
grossly
mismanaged
and
it
was
rickman
own
fault
look
here
he
said
what
on
earth
possessed
you
to
go
and
refuse
that
introduction
to
hanson
was
it
just
your
cheek
or
the
own
pride
or
what
neither
said
rickman
in
a
tone
that
pathetically
intimated
that
he
was
worn
out
i
think
it
was
chiefly
my
desire
for
peace
and
quiet
i
writing
some
more
poems
you
see
i
would
have
refused
it
at
any
other
time
at
any
other
time
it
would
have
mattered
so
much
you
should
be
civil
to
the
people
who
can
help
you
i
rather
distrust
that
sort
of
civility
myself
i
seen
too
much
of
the
dirty
back
stairs
of
fleet
street
i
tumbled
over
the
miserable
people
who
sit
on
them
all
day
long
and
i
do
mean
anybody
to
tumble
over
me
when
i
got
my
best
trousers
on
i
want
to
keep
them
clean
it
a
mistake
said
maddox
to
wear
your
best
trousers
every
day
perhaps
but
i
mean
to
wear
them
wear
them
by
all
means
but
you
must
make
up
your
mind
for
a
certain
amount
of
wear
and
tear
in
your
case
it
will
probably
be
tear
that
my
quite
so
i
would
say
anything
if
it
was
only
hanson
offended
but
you
should
alienate
your
friends
my
friends
yes
why
oh
why
did
you
make
that
joke
about
mackinnon
head
we
were
all
making
jokes
about
mackinnon
head
yes
but
we
were
all
of
us
bringing
out
poems
the
next
day
your
position
was
one
of
peculiar
delicacy
and
danger
what
does
it
matter
said
rickman
wearily
i
can
trust
my
friends
to
speak
the
truth
about
me
heaven
bless
you
rickman
and
may
your
spring
suitings
last
for
ever
he
added
as
jewdwine
had
added
anyhow
this
friend
will
do
his
level
best
for
you
at
which
rickman
demon
returned
again
do
crack
me
up
too
much
maddy
you
might
do
me
harm
but
before
midnight
maddox
burst
into
the
office
and
flung
himself
on
to
his
desk
give
me
room
he
cried
i
mean
to
spread
myself
to
roll
to
wallow
to
wanton
to
volupt
before
morning
he
had
poured
out
his
soul
in
four
columns
of
the
exuberant
irrepressible
soul
of
the
celt
he
did
it
in
an
hour
and
twenty
minutes
as
he
said
himself
afterwards
relating
his
marvellous
achievement
he
was
sustained
by
one
continuous
inspiration
his
passionate
pen
paused
neither
for
punctuation
nor
for
thought
the
thoughts
he
said
were
there
as
the
critical
notices
only
appeared
weekly
to
pause
would
have
entailed
a
delay
of
seven
days
and
he
meant
that
his
panegyric
should
appear
the
very
next
day
after
the
article
in
the
as
an
answer
to
damnable
paragraph
if
maddox
was
urged
to
these
excesses
by
his
contempt
for
critical
cowardice
jewdwine
was
cooled
by
the
spectacle
of
intemperance
he
had
begun
by
feeling
a
little
bitter
towards
rickman
on
his
own
account
he
was
disappointed
in
him
rickman
had
shown
that
he
was
indifferent
to
his
opinion
that
being
so
jewdwine
might
have
been
forgiven
if
he
had
had
no
very
keen
desire
to
help
him
still
he
desired
to
help
him
but
his
desire
had
ceased
after
reading
maddox
review
there
was
no
pleasure
in
helping
him
now
since
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
taken
up
and
caressed
so
violently
by
other
people
the
clumsy
hand
of
maddox
had
brushed
the
first
bloom
from
his
rickman
that
once
delightful
youth
he
was
no
longer
rickman
his
disciple
his
discovery
but
though
jewdwine
felt
bitter
he
was
careful
that
no
tinge
of
this
personal
feeling
should
appear
in
his
review
of
rickman
poems
it
was
exceedingly
difficult
for
him
to
review
them
at
all
he
had
to
take
an
independent
attitude
and
most
possible
attitudes
had
been
taken
already
he
could
not
ignore
rickman
deplorable
connection
with
the
decadents
and
yet
he
could
not
insist
on
it
for
that
was
what
hanson
and
the
rest
had
done
rickman
had
got
to
stay
there
he
could
not
step
in
and
pluck
him
out
like
a
brand
from
the
burning
for
maddox
had
just
accomplished
that
heroic
feat
he
would
say
nothing
that
would
lend
countenance
to
the
extravagance
of
maddox
there
was
really
no
room
for
fresh
appreciation
anywhere
he
could
not
give
blame
where
hanson
had
given
it
and
maddox
had
plastered
every
line
with
praise
he
would
have
been
the
first
to
praise
rickman
provided
that
he
the
first
not
that
jewdwine
ever
committed
himself
as
a
critic
his
surest
resource
had
always
lain
in
understatement
if
the
swan
was
a
goose
jewdwine
had
as
good
as
said
so
if
the
goose
proved
a
swan
jewdwine
had
implied
as
much
by
his
magnificent
reserve
but
this
time
the
middle
course
was
imposed
on
him
less
by
conviction
than
necessity
he
had
to
hold
the
balance
true
between
hanson
and
maddox
in
his
efforts
to
hold
it
true
he
became
more
than
ever
academic
and
judicial
so
judicial
so
impartial
was
he
in
his
opinion
that
he
really
seemed
to
have
no
opinion
at
all
to
be
merely
summing
up
the
evidence
and
leaving
the
verdict
to
the
incorruptible
jury
every
sentence
sounded
as
though
it
had
been
passed
through
a
refrigerator
not
a
hint
or
a
sign
that
he
had
ever
recognized
in
rickman
the
possibility
of
greatness
now
if
rickman
had
not
been
connected
with
the
review
would
have
done
him
neither
harm
nor
good
as
it
was
it
did
him
harm
it
was
naturally
supposed
that
jewdwine
so
far
from
understating
his
admiration
had
suppressed
his
bad
opinion
in
the
interests
of
friendship
rickman
remained
where
hanson
had
placed
it
rather
low
in
the
ranks
of
young
decadence
and
then
just
because
he
had
suppressed
the
truth
about
him
because
he
felt
that
he
had
given
rickman
some
grounds
for
bitterness
jewdwine
began
to
feel
more
and
more
bitter
himself
if
rickman
felt
any
bitterness
he
never
showed
it
he
had
only
two
thoughts
on
reading
jewdwine
articles
it
would
have
mattered
except
that
will
see
it
and
i
would
have
minded
if
it
was
what
he
really
thought
maddox
rightly
judging
that
rickman
would
be
suffering
more
in
his
affection
than
his
vanity
called
on
him
that
afternoon
and
dragged
him
out
for
his
usual
saturday
walk
as
if
the
thought
of
jewdwine
dominated
their
movements
they
found
themselves
on
the
way
to
hampstead
maddox
attempted
consolation
it
really
does
matter
much
what
jewdwine
says
these
fellows
come
up
from
oxford
with
wet
towels
round
their
heads
to
keep
the
metaphysics
in
jewdwine
muddled
himself
with
the
absolute
beauty
till
he
does
know
a
beautiful
thing
if
you
stick
it
under
his
nose
possibly
not
if
you
keep
it
farther
off
he
might
have
a
better
chance
trust
him
to
know
well
if
he
knows
he
does
care
oh
does
he
that
where
jewdwine
great
he
cares
for
nothing
else
he
cares
more
than
any
man
alive
in
his
heart
d
n
his
heart
i
do
believe
he
has
one
would
you
oblige
me
by
not
talking
about
him
any
more
maddox
obliged
him
they
tramped
far
into
the
country
returning
at
nightfall
by
the
great
road
that
crosses
the
high
ground
of
the
heath
rickman
loved
that
road
for
by
night
or
on
a
misty
evening
it
was
possible
to
imagine
some
remote
resemblance
between
it
and
the
long
straight
ridge
of
harcombe
hill
they
paused
by
common
consent
where
the
heath
drops
suddenly
from
the
edge
of
the
road
opening
out
the
view
towards
london
the
hollow
beneath
them
filled
by
a
thin
fog
had
become
mysterious
and
immense
by
the
way
said
maddox
following
an
apparently
irrelevant
train
of
thought
what
has
become
of
your
friendship
for
miss
poppy
grace
it
has
gone
said
rickman
where
the
old
trousers
go
look
there
above
them
heaven
seemed
to
hang
low
bringing
its
stars
nearer
a
few
clouds
drifted
across
it
drenched
in
the
blue
of
the
night
behind
them
a
watery
and
opaque
below
sunk
in
a
night
greyer
and
deeper
were
the
lights
of
london
the
ridge
they
stood
on
was
like
the
rampart
of
another
world
hung
between
the
stars
which
are
the
lights
of
poets
and
the
lights
which
are
the
stars
of
men
under
the
stars
maddox
chanted
softly
the
last
verses
of
the
of
that
rickman
had
made
oh
he
said
you
know
everything
how
did
you
know
it
because
i
been
there
but
you
did
stay
no
no
i
did
stay
i
could
i
still
there
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
see
no
way
out
it
like
going
round
in
the
underground
railway
a
vicious
circle
since
given
to
confession
own
up
do
you
ever
want
to
get
back
there
not
yet
my
way
wo
take
me
back
if
i
only
stick
to
it
under
the
stars
he
endeavoured
to
account
for
his
extraordinary
choosing
of
the
way
i
three
reasons
for
keeping
straight
to
begin
with
i
got
a
conviction
that
i
write
something
great
if
i
do
go
to
the
devil
first
then
there
horace
jewdwine
maddox
hardened
his
face
he
had
been
told
not
to
talk
about
jewdwine
and
he
was
going
to
if
i
go
to
the
devil
he
wo
go
with
me
say
what
you
like
he
a
saint
compared
with
you
and
me
if
he
does
understand
songs
of
confession
it
because
he
never
had
anything
to
confess
the
third
reason
if
i
go
to
the
devil
no
i
ca
tell
you
the
third
reason
it
also
the
reason
why
i
wear
my
magnificent
trousers
all
the
reasons
amount
to
that
if
i
go
to
the
devil
i
ca
wear
those
trousers
never
maddox
believe
me
never
again
maddox
smiled
and
unlike
maddox
he
said
one
thing
and
thought
another
what
he
said
was
your
trousers
are
of
too
heavenly
a
pattern
for
this
wicked
world
they
are
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
of
and
their
little
life
he
paused
what
he
thought
was
your
way
is
deuced
hard
for
the
likes
of
me
but
i
go
with
you
as
far
as
i
can
my
son
under
the
stars

looked
into
each
other
faces

they
knew

aright
chapter
xliv
jewdwine
made
up
for
the
coldness
of
his
published
utterances
by
the
fervour
of
his
secret
counsel
his
advice
to
rickman
was
beware
of
the
friendship
of
little
men
this
rickman
understood
to
be
a
reflection
on
maddox
position
in
the
world
of
letters
he
did
not
care
a
rap
about
maddox
position
but
there
were
moments
when
it
was
borne
in
upon
him
that
maddox
was
a
bigger
man
even
than
horace
jewdwine
that
his
reckless
manner
poorly
disguised
a
deeper
insight
and
a
sounder
judgement
his
work
on
proved
it
every
day
and
though
for
himself
he
could
have
desired
a
somewhat
discreeter
champion
he
had
the
highest
opinion
of
his
friend
courage
in
standing
up
for
him
when
there
was
absolutely
nothing
to
be
gained
by
it
he
had
every
reason
therefore
to
be
attached
to
maddox
but
it
was
true
enough
that
he
knew
too
many
little
men
men
who
were
at
home
in
that
house
of
bondage
from
which
he
was
for
ever
longing
to
escape
men
whom
he
had
met
as
he
had
described
sitting
contentedly
on
the
dirty
of
fleet
street
men
who
in
rubbing
shoulders
with
each
other
in
that
crowded
thoroughfare
had
had
to
allow
for
a
great
deal
of
what
maddox
called
wear
and
tear
those
little
men
had
remained
invincibly
imperturbably
friendly
they
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
thought
them
little
men
and
they
delighted
in
their
great
man
all
the
same
more
than
ever
in
fact
since
his
new
suit
of
morals
provided
them
with
a
subject
of
eternal
jest
for
maddox
was
but
human
and
he
had
found
rickman
phrase
too
pregnant
with
humour
to
be
lost
they
were
sometimes
very
funny
those
junior
journalists
especially
on
a
saturday
night
but
rickman
was
not
interested
in
the
unseemly
obstacle
race
they
dignified
by
the
name
of
a
career
and
he
did
not
care
to
mix
too
freely
with
young
men
so
little
concerned
about
removing
the
dirt
and
sweat
of
it
he
clung
to
maddox
and
rankin
as
the
strongest
and
the
cleanest
of
them
all
but
even
they
had
inspirations
that
left
him
cold
and
they
thought
many
things
large
and
important
that
were
too
small
for
him
to
see
he
would
have
died
rather
than
let
either
of
them
know
what
he
was
doing
now
he
saw
with
dismay
that
they
suspected
him
of
doing
something
that
their
suspicions
excited
them
most
horribly
that
they
were
watching
him
and
he
had
told
maddox
that
what
he
desired
most
was
peace
and
quietness
he
found
it
in
the
secret
chamber
of
the
muse
where
he
shut
himself
up
when
his
work
with
them
was
done
in
there
his
days
and
nights
were
as
the
days
and
nights
of
god
there
he
forecast
the
schemes
of
dramas
yet
to
be
dramas
no
longer
and
as
his
genius
foresaw
the
approach
of
its
maturity
it
purified
and
emptied
itself
of
the
personal
passion
that
obscures
the
dramatist
vision
of
the
world
this
it
did
in
a
sequence
of
nine
and
twenty
sonnets
a
golden
chain
that
bound
lucia
name
to
his
whether
she
would
or
no
they
recorded
nine
and
twenty
moments
in
the
life
of
his
passion
from
the
day
of
its
birth
up
to
the
present
hour
the
hour
of
its
purification
for
it
was
still
young
in
him
though
at
this
distance
of
time
image
was
no
longer
one
and
indivisible
he
had
come
to
think
of
her
as
two
persons
clothed
mysteriously
in
the
same
garment
of
flesh
one
carried
that
garment
a
little
more
conspicuously
than
the
other
it
was
by
her
beauty
that
she
pierced
him
with
the
pain
of
longing
and
not
by
her
beauty
only
but
by
the
marks
of
suffering
that
in
his
memory
still
obscured
it
she
came
before
him
and
her
tragic
eyes
reproached
him
with
the
intolerable
pathos
of
her
fate
making
him
suffer
too
through
his
exceeding
pity
and
yet
his
longing
had
not
been
consumed
by
pity
but
had
mingled
with
it
as
flame
in
flame
long
after
he
had
parted
from
her
his
senses
ached
as
they
recalled
the
exquisite
movements
of
her
body
he
had
only
to
shut
his
eyes
and
he
was
aware
of
the
little
ripple
of
her
shoulders
and
the
delicate
swaying
of
her
hips
to
lie
awake
in
the
dark
was
to
see
her
kneeling
at
his
side
to
feel
the
fragrance
of
her
thick
braid
of
hair
flattened
and
warmed
by
her
sleep
and
the
light
touch
of
her
hands
as
they
covered
him
and
before
that
memory
his
shame
still
burnt
deeper
than
his
desire
but
this
lucia
had
no
desire
for
him
and
no
pity
her
countenance
seen
even
in
dreams
expressed
a
calm
but
immutable
repugnance
no
wonder
for
was
only
acquainted
with
the
pitiably
inadequate
sample
of
him
introduced
to
her
as
rickman
of
rickman
he
was
aware
that
she
belonged
exclusively
not
only
to
jewdwine
class
but
to
jewdwine
himself
in
some
way
a
way
unspeakably
disagreeable
to
contemplate
if
he
was
not
to
think
of
her
as
enduring
the
abominations
of
poverty
he
must
think
of
her
as
married
to
jewdwine
married
to
jewdwine
she
would
make
an
end
of
his
friendship
as
she
had
made
an
end
of
his
peace
of
mind
there
had
been
moments
at
the
first
when
he
had
felt
a
fierce
and
unforgiving
rage
against
her
for
the
annoyance
that
she
caused
him
but
now
dividing
the
host
of
turbulent
and
tormenting
memories
there
appeared
a
different
lucia
an
invincible
but
intimate
presence
that
brought
with
it
a
sense
of
deliverance
and
consolation
it
was
lucia
herself
that
saved
him
from
lucia
her
eyes
were
full
of
discernment
and
of
an
infinite
tenderness
and
compassion
they
kindled
in
him
the
desire
that
fulfils
itself
in
its
own
utterance
that
this
lucia
was
not
wholly
the
creature
of
his
imagination
he
was
assured
by
his
memory
of
certain
passages
in
his
life
at
harmouth
a
memory
that
had
all
the
vividness
and
insistence
of
the
other
it
was
the
lucia
he
had
known
before
the
other
lucia
the
lucia
who
had
divined
and
would
divine
him
still
in
a
way
she
was
more
real
than
the
other
more
real
than
flesh
and
blood
even
as
that
part
of
him
by
which
he
apprehended
her
was
more
real
than
the
rest
from
her
he
was
not
and
could
not
be
divided
they
belonged
to
each
other
and
by
no
possibility
could
he
think
of
this
lucia
as
married
to
jewdwine
or
of
his
friendship
for
jewdwine
as
in
anyway
affected
by
her
he
was
hers
by
right
of
her
perfect
comprehension
of
him
for
such
comprehension
was
of
the
nature
of
possession
it
was
also
an
assurance
of
her
forgiveness
if
indeed
she
had
anything
to
forgive
he
had
not
wronged
her
it
was
the
other
lucia
he
had
wronged
in
all
this
he
never
once
thought
of
her
as
his
inspiration
she
would
not
have
desired
him
to
think
of
her
so
being
both
too
humble
and
too
proud
to
claim
any
part
in
the
genius
she
divined
but
she
could
not
repudiate
all
connection
with
it
because
it
was
in
the
moments
when
his
genius
was
most
dominant
that
he
had
this
untroubled
assurance
of
her
presence
and
there
in
the
secret
chamber
he
bound
her
to
him
by
an
indestructible
chain
the
chain
of
the
nine
and
twenty
sonnets
the
question
was
what
should
he
do
with
it
now
that
it
was
made
to
dedicate
sonnets
to
lucia
was
one
thing
to
print
them
was
another
if
it
was
inevitable
that
he
should
thus
reveal
himself
after
the
manner
of
poets
it
was
also
inevitable
that
she
should
regard
a
public
declaration
as
an
insult
rather
than
an
honour
and
he
himself
shrank
from
exposing
so
sacred
a
thing
to
the
pollution
and
violence
of
publicity
therefore
he
took
each
sonnet
as
it
was
written
and
hid
it
in
a
drawer
but
he
was
not
without
prescience
of
their
ultimate
value
and
after
all
this
method
of
disposal
seemed
to
him
somehow
unsatisfactory
so
he
determined
that
he
would
leave
the
manuscript
to
lucia
in
his
will
to
be
afterwards
dealt
with
as
she
judged
best
whether
she
chose
to
publish
or
to
burn
in
the
former
case
the
proceeds
might
be
regarded
as
partial
payment
of
a
debt
and
so
two
years
passed
and
it
was
spring
again
chapter
xlv
there
are
many
ways
of
achieving
distinction
but
few
are
more
effectual
than
a
steady
habit
of
punctuality
by
this
you
may
shine
even
in
the
appalling
gloom
of
the
underground
railway
among
all
the
women
who
wait
every
morning
for
the
city
trains
at
gower
street
station
there
was
none
more
conspicuously
punctual
than
miss
flossie
walker
the
early
clerk
who
travelled
citywards
was
always
sure
of
seeing
that
little
figure
on
the
same
spot
at
the
same
moment
provided
he
himself
were
punctual
and
kept
a
sharp
this
you
may
be
sure
he
took
good
care
to
do
to
look
at
flossie
once
was
to
look
again
and
yet
again
and
he
was
fortunate
indeed
if
his
route
lay
between
moorgate
street
station
and
the
bank
for
then
he
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
sharply
threading
her
way
among
the
traffic
if
that
can
be
said
of
anything
so
soft
and
round
as
flossie
if
flossie
figure
was
small
and
round
her
face
was
somewhat
large
a
perfect
oval
moulded
in
the
subtlest
curves
smooth
and
white
moreover
with
a
tinge
of
ivory
sallow
towards
the
roots
of
her
black
hair
wonderful
hair
was
flossie
in
those
days
she
parted
it
in
the
middle
and
waved
it
symmetrically
on
either
side
of
her
low
forehead
she
brought
it
over
her
ears
covering
all
but
the
tips
and
the
delicate
pink
lobes
she
coiled
it
at
the
back
in
an
elaborate
spiral
and
twisted
it
into
innumerable
little
curls
about
the
nape
of
her
neck
unfortunately
that
neck
was
rather
short
but
she
wore
low
collars
which
made
the
most
of
it
and
then
flossie
features
were
so
very
correct
she
had
a
correct
little
nose
neither
straight
nor
aquiline
but
a
distracting
mixture
of
both
and
a
correct
little
mouth
so
correct
and
so
small
that
you
wondered
how
it
managed
to
display
so
many
white
teeth
in
one
diminutive
smile
flossie
eyes
were
not
as
her
mouth
they
were
large
and
blacker
than
her
hair
no
wonder
if
the
poor
clerk
who
passed
her
on
her
way
to
and
fro
in
the
city
rejoiced
as
they
looked
up
at
him
she
might
be
going
to
her
work
as
he
to
his
but
what
with
her
bright
eyes
and
her
blue
ribbons
she
looked
the
very
genius
of
holiday
as
she
went
at
first
she
was
a
little
subdued
and
awed
by
the
bank
and
by
her
own
position
in
it
but
when
this
feeling
wore
off
the
plump
girl
rolled
into
her
place
with
a
delicious
abandonment
flossie
was
one
of
fifty
girls
who
sat
row
after
row
at
long
flat
desks
covered
with
green
cloth
a
soft
monotonous
light
was
reflected
from
the
walls
against
which
flossie
head
stood
out
with
striking
effect
like
some
modern
study
in
black
and
morbid
white
you
would
have
picked
her
out
among
the
fifty
at
once
hers
was
the
lightest
of
light
labour
the
delicate
handling
of
thousands
of
cancelled
notes
airy
insubstantial
things
as
it
were
the
ghosts
of
released
from
the
gross
conditions
of
the
currency
towards
the
middle
of
the
morning
flossie
would
be
immersed
in
a
pale
agitated
sea
of
the
air
would
be
full
of
light
sounds
always
the
sharp
brisk
rustling
of
the
notes
and
now
and
then
a
human
undertone
or
towards
lunch
time
a
breath
that
was
like
a
sigh
a
place
to
grow
in
if
you
began
to
think
about
it
happily
no
thought
was
required
beyond
the
intelligence
that
lives
in
sensitive
it
was
almost
mechanical
labour
and
for
that
flossie
had
more
than
a
taste
she
had
a
positive
genius
it
was
mechanical
labour
idealized
and
reduced
to
a
fine
art
an
art
in
which
the
personality
of
the
artist
counted
the
work
displayed
to
perfection
the
prettiness
of
flossie
hands
from
the
rapid
play
of
her
fingers
in
sifting
and
their
little
fluttering
hovering
movements
in
arranging
to
the
exquisitely
soft
touches
of
the
palms
when
she
gathered
all
her
sheaves
of
notes
into
one
sheaf
shaking
caressing
coaxing
the
rough
edges
into
line
flossie
worked
with
the
rhythm
and
precision
of
a
machine
and
yet
humanly
almost
coquettishly
as
under
the
master
eye
but
all
this
was
of
yesterday
flossie
was
different
she
was
not
quite
so
precise
so
punctual
as
she
had
been
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
bright
little
mechanism
it
worked
erratically
now
under
protest
and
now
with
spurts
of
terrifying
activity
the
fine
of
thought
had
set
off
whirring
on
their
own
account
and
had
got
mixed
up
with
the
rest
of
the
machinery
flossie
had
begun
to
philosophise
to
annoy
destiny
with
questions
there
was
time
for
that
in
the
afternoon
when
the
worst
of
the
sorting
was
done
she
was
in
the
stage
of
doubt
so
attractive
in
philosophers
and
women
asking
herself
is
knowledge
possible
and
if
so
what
do
i
know
she
was
aware
that
there
are
certain
insurpassable
limits
to
human
knowledge
all
the
same
she
raised
herself
on
and
tried
to
peep
over
the
boundaries
what
did
she
know
she
knew
that
somebody
pitied
her
because
poor
little
woman
she
had
to
earn
her
own
living
like
a
man
well
she
would
not
have
to
do
that
if
he
if
he
yes
and
if
he
did
and
how
was
she
to
know
and
yet
and
yet
she
had
an
idea
anybody
may
have
an
idea
then
the
long
desks
became
the
green
tables
where
flossie
gambled
with
fate
trying
trying
trying
to
force
the
invisible
hand
for
with
flossie
it
was
too
under
the
little
correctness
and
demureness
there
ran
and
mingled
with
her
blood
the
warm
undercurrent
of
a
dream
the
dream
had
come
to
her
many
springs
ago
and
as
flossie
grew
plumper
and
rosier
it
grew
plump
and
rosy
too
to
be
married
to
a
person
hitherto
unspecified
in
fancy
whose
features
remained
a
blur
or
a
blank
to
be
the
mistress
of
a
dear
little
house
the
house
stood
out
very
clear
in
flossie
fancy
and
the
mother
of
a
dear
little
girl
a
figure
ever
present
to
her
complete
in
socks
and
shoes
and
all
the
delicious
details
of
its
dress
compared
with
that
vision
of
flossie
no
dream
was
ever
so
soft
so
rosy
and
so
young
and
now
in
the
all
her
being
moved
softly
under
the
current
of
the
dream
flossie
fancy
did
not
associate
it
consciously
with
keith
rickman
she
would
have
blushed
if
the
association
had
been
made
apparent
to
her
the
spring
did
that
for
her
mingling
with
her
blood
meanwhile
as
flossie
dreamed
the
same
hour
every
morning
rickman
was
awakened
by
the
same
sounds
the
click
of
the
in
the
bedroom
overhead
and
the
patter
of
a
girl
feet
on
the
stairs
he
knew
it
was
miss
flossie
walker
going
down
to
early
breakfast
and
when
he
heard
it
he
turned
in
his
bed
on
the
side
farthest
from
the
window
and
sighed
such
a
deep
unhappy
sigh
lucia
had
delivered
him
from
lucia
but
there
were
other
troubles
from
which
she
could
not
save
him
not
in
the
warm
spring
days
from
the
newly
awakened
trouble
of
his
youth
not
in
the
sleepless
summer
nights
from
the
brief
but
recurrent
tyranny
of
sense
and
not
from
the
incessant
hunger
of
the
heart
though
it
was
she
who
had
created
that
hunger
in
him
it
was
not
at
five
and
twenty
to
be
satisfied
by
the
mere
image
of
her
however
vividly
present
to
him
he
was
only
five
and
twenty
and
the
spring
had
come
with
its
piercing
sweetness
its
irresistible
delicate
lure
to
the
great
stirring
melting
and
unbinding
of
his
manhood
he
could
be
faithful
to
lucia
for
ever
in
his
soul
but
there
were
moments
in
this
season
when
he
was
aware
of
a
distinct
cleavage
between
his
soul
and
his
senses
it
seemed
to
him
that
miss
flossie
walker
lay
in
wait
for
him
in
just
those
moments
with
the
secret
but
infallible
instinct
of
the
creatures
whom
the
spring
touches
to
its
own
uses
he
could
not
blame
her
flossie
was
innocent
being
but
the
unconscious
handmaid
of
the
spring
it
was
not
because
lucia
was
forever
absent
and
flossie
forever
on
the
spot
at
first
he
was
unaware
of
the
danger
that
lurked
for
him
in
flossie
ways
because
his
soul
in
its
love
for
lucia
was
so
utterly
secure
at
first
the
sighs
were
all
on
flossie
account
poor
flossie
who
had
to
be
up
so
early
while
he
settled
himself
for
another
luxurious
slumber
at
first
he
only
pitied
flossie
he
thought
of
her
at
odd
moments
as
a
poor
little
girl
rather
pretty
who
worked
too
hard
and
never
had
any
fun
to
speak
of
but
the
rest
of
the
time
he
never
thought
of
her
at
all
and
in
the
early
days
of
their
acquaintance
miss
flossie
walker
then
only
an
apprentice
to
a
firm
of
in
holborn
was
very
much
to
be
pitied
he
could
remember
how
she
had
come
a
little
while
before
that
memorable
bank
holiday
to
downey
a
plump
but
rather
anaemic
maiden
and
demure
he
had
begun
by
talking
to
her
at
table
because
she
sat
next
to
him
and
he
had
ended
if
there
ever
is
an
end
to
these
things
by
taking
her
to
matinées
restaurants
and
the
british
museum
the
girl
was
so
young
so
confiding
and
so
obviously
respectable
that
he
was
careful
to
keep
to
the
most
guileless
of
entertainments
a
few
weeks
of
this
existence
brought
shy
smiles
and
a
lively
play
of
dimples
on
flossie
face
she
grew
plumper
still
less
anaemic
though
hardly
less
demure
a
few
months
and
flossie
beauty
flowered
and
expanded
she
began
to
dress
as
became
it
entering
into
rivalry
with
miss
ada
bishop
until
it
dawned
on
him
that
flossie
was
really
in
her
own
place
and
way
a
very
engaging
little
creature
about
this
time
flossie
circumstances
had
improved
as
much
as
her
appearance
her
father
had
been
a
clerk
in
the
bank
of
england
and
on
his
death
she
obtained
a
post
there
as
a
sorter
that
position
gave
flossie
both
dignity
and
independence
it
meant
light
work
and
hours
which
brought
hope
with
them
every
day
towards
three
under
these
circumstances
flossie
beauty
went
on
flowering
and
expanding
till
she
became
more
than
ever
a
thing
of
danger
and
disaster
her
intimacy
with
rickman
which
had
lapsed
lately
owing
to
his
increasing
passion
for
solitude
and
separation
revived
suddenly
in
the
spring
of
it
happened
in
this
manner
with
the
spring
downey
was
once
more
agitated
by
the
hope
of
the
bank
holiday
and
spinks
inquired
of
rickman
if
he
were
going
out
of
town
for
easter
rickman
was
incautiously
dining
that
evening
at
the
general
table
but
rickman
was
going
out
of
town
he
said
he
thought
of
going
somewhere
up
the
river
he
had
also
thought
though
he
did
not
say
so
that
in
fulfilment
of
an
ancient
promise
he
would
take
miss
flossie
to
the
play
on
saturday
afternoon
yet
when
it
came
to
the
point
he
had
some
diffidence
in
asking
her
she
might
not
think
it
proper
it
was
soper
who
precipitated
his
resolve
he
wanted
to
know
if
rickman
had
made
up
a
party
for
the
river
and
any
companion
no
he
had
made
up
a
party
thanks
awfully
he
was
going
by
himself
soper
did
think
now
that
was
a
very
enjoyable
way
of
spendin
a
bank
holiday
he
put
it
that
if
it
was
rickman
intention
to
hire
a
it
would
be
at
all
a
bad
idea
if
he
soper
and
spinks
say
were
to
join
as
soper
incredible
suggestion
sank
into
him
the
expression
of
rickman
face
was
pitiable
to
see
it
was
then
that
casually
as
if
the
idea
had
only
just
occurred
to
him
he
wondered
whether
miss
walker
would
by
any
chance
care
for
a
matinée
ticket
for
the
play
he
was
anxious
to
give
his
offer
an
uncertain
and
impromptu
character
suggesting
that
miss
walker
must
be
torn
between
her
many
engagements
and
have
matinée
tickets
in
large
numbers
up
the
sleeve
of
her
charming
blouse
flossie
was
so
shy
that
when
you
spoke
to
her
she
never
answered
all
at
once
so
shy
that
when
she
spoke
to
you
she
never
turned
her
head
to
look
at
you
but
left
you
to
judge
of
the
effect
you
made
on
her
by
the
corners
of
her
mouth
and
eyes
so
now
he
had
to
look
very
carefully
at
her
to
see
whether
she
were
saying
yes
or
no
casually
again
as
if
this
course
were
not
necessarily
involved
in
acceptance
he
inquired
whether
he
might
have
the
pleasure
of
taking
her
miss
bishop
looked
another
way
her
loose
mouth
hung
desirous
miss
bishop
face
was
flagrantly
frank
devoid
of
all
repose
none
of
these
people
had
any
repose
about
them
except
flossie
flossie
was
dubious
and
demure
was
he
quite
sure
it
was
a
pleasure
he
protested
that
in
a
world
where
few
things
were
certain
that
at
any
rate
admitted
of
no
doubt
flossie
deliberated
whether
this
further
step
were
or
were
not
a
departure
from
her
ideal
of
propriety
and
it
was
not
until
he
showed
signs
of
retracting
his
proposal
that
she
intimated
her
consent
but
as
for
pleasure
if
flossie
were
pleased
she
did
not
allow
it
to
appear
and
although
her
heart
beat
excitedly
under
her
blue
blouse
it
was
on
the
side
that
was
not
next
to
rickman
then
miss
roots
began
to
talk
of
incomprehensible
things
excitedly
so
excitedly
that
she
had
for
the
moment
quite
a
colour
and
while
they
talked
all
the
other
boarders
turned
in
their
places
and
watched
rickman
as
if
he
had
been
some
wonderful
enchanter
soper
alone
emphasizing
by
an
attitude
his
entire
aloofness
from
the
general
interest
and
all
the
time
miss
roots
was
talking
flossie
without
saying
a
word
contrived
to
seize
upon
the
disengaged
portion
of
his
mind
he
wondered
what
she
was
thinking
about
she
was
thinking
first
that
it
really
paid
to
put
on
your
best
blouse
every
evening
next
that
it
was
worth
while
if
he
would
keep
on
talking
to
the
lady
on
his
right
then
that
she
decide
the
point
until
she
knew
where
he
was
going
on
sunday
that
she
never
knew
but
she
went
to
the
play
with
him
on
saturday
and
on
many
saturdays
after
that
there
was
nobody
so
gay
that
spring
as
flossie
coming
fresh
to
flossie
after
a
long
estrangement
rickman
recognize
her
from
his
old
account
of
her
as
a
poor
little
girl
who
worked
too
hard
and
never
had
any
fun
to
speak
of
in
so
describing
her
no
doubt
he
had
been
influenced
by
the
melancholy
of
his
earlier
mood
but
there
were
other
reasons
why
he
still
insisted
on
regarding
her
in
this
pathetic
light
it
provided
him
with
several
very
agreeable
sensations
and
the
most
agreeable
of
all
was
the
voluptuous
passion
of
pity
it
kept
him
detached
always
in
the
superior
position
of
a
benefactor
benefactor
indeed
he
was
in
a
fair
way
of
becoming
flossie
deity
her
providence
the
mystic
source
of
and
joy
no
really
brave
man
ever
shrinks
from
the
dangers
of
apotheosis
when
the
process
involves
no
loss
of
personal
dignity
and
apart
from
the
gratification
of
his
natural
healthy
vanity
heart
was
touched
by
the
thought
that
the
little
thing
turned
to
him
instinctively
for
all
her
innocent
pleasures
then
all
at
once
the
innocent
pleasures
ceased
they
ceased
just
as
flossie
palpitating
heart
told
her
that
she
was
really
making
an
impression
on
this
singularly
unimpressionable
young
man
she
knew
it
by
the
sudden
softening
of
his
voice
as
he
spoke
to
her
by
the
curious
brilliant
dilation
of
his
eyes
as
they
followed
her
about
the
room
for
after
much
easy
practice
on
spinks
she
knew
precisely
by
what
movements
and
what
glances
she
could
best
produce
these
interesting
effects
and
yet
nothing
could
be
farther
from
fancy
than
flirtation
the
little
clerk
was
nothing
if
not
practical
even
under
the
tender
impulse
of
her
dream
flossie
was
determined
that
whatever
else
she
failed
in
she
would
not
fail
in
her
woman
trade
she
would
have
considered
herself
disgraced
by
such
bankruptcy
not
that
she
feared
it
nature
had
started
her
with
a
sufficient
capital
of
fascination
and
at
downey
she
had
so
to
speak
established
a
connection
and
now
it
seemed
there
had
come
a
period
of
depression
it
still
rained
tickets
more
tickets
than
ever
but
there
was
no
rickman
to
escort
her
to
the
concert
or
the
play
rickman
always
had
another
engagement
never
specified
no
rickman
to
take
her
into
the
suburbs
on
a
sunday
rickman
was
off
goodness
knew
where
scouring
the
country
on
his
bicycle
no
rickman
to
talk
to
her
at
dinner
rickman
took
all
his
meals
in
his
own
room
now
for
these
and
all
other
delinquencies
his
invariable
excuse
was
that
he
was
busy
and
flossie
mind
you
was
sharp
enough
to
see
through
no
rickman
had
changed
suddenly
unaccountably
without
a
moment
warning
first
of
all
the
other
boarders
noticed
that
he
had
become
most
frightfully
irritable
in
his
temper
he
had
not
been
over
polite
to
any
of
them
lately
but
to
her
he
was
insufferably
rude
most
ungentlemanly
she
called
it
he
would
pretend
not
to
see
her
if
by
any
chance
she
looked
his
way
not
to
hear
her
if
by
any
chance
she
spoke
to
him
once
they
were
quite
alone
he
had
broken
off
in
the
middle
of
an
exciting
conversation
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
out
of
the
house
she
saw
him
over
the
balcony
railings
walking
up
and
down
the
street
like
a
lunatic
with
his
hands
thrust
down
into
his
pockets
and
no
hat
on
and
he
was
not
only
ungentlemanly
but
positively
unkind
if
they
met
on
the
stairs
somehow
they
did
this
very
often
he
would
draw
himself
up
flat
against
the
wall
as
if
he
was
afraid
of
the
frill
of
her
dress
touching
him
if
she
came
into
the
he
would
walk
out
of
it
or
if
he
stayed
it
was
only
to
sit
staring
at
her
poor
innocent
little
flossie
who
was
so
pretty
with
an
ugly
scowl
on
his
face
there
were
times
when
poor
innocent
little
flossie
said
to
herself
that
she
positively
believed
he
hated
her
and
she
was
so
innocent
that
she
could
think
what
she
had
done
to
make
him
hate
her
she
was
right
about
the
hatred
an
indignant
anger
was
certainly
what
he
felt
when
he
first
realized
that
she
had
power
to
make
him
feel
at
all
her
prettiness
tormented
him
therefore
he
hated
her
and
everything
about
her
he
hated
the
sound
of
her
little
tongue
upraised
among
the
boarders
and
of
her
little
feet
running
up
and
down
the
stairs
he
hated
every
glance
of
her
black
eyes
and
every
attitude
and
movement
of
her
plump
little
body
more
than
all
he
hated
the
touch
of
her
soft
arms
as
they
stirred
against
him
at
the
tightly
packed
therefore
he
avoided
the
and
the
he
avoided
as
far
as
possible
the
house
filled
as
it
was
with
the
disastrous
presence
he
fatigued
himself
with
excesses
of
walking
and
cycling
in
the
hope
that
when
he
flung
himself
into
his
bed
at
midnight
he
would
be
too
tired
to
feel
and
sometimes
he
was
at
last
poor
flossie
weary
of
conjecture
unbent
so
far
as
to
seek
counsel
of
miss
bishop
for
miss
bishop
gave
you
to
understand
that
on
the
subject
of
gentlemen
there
was
nothing
that
she
did
not
know
it
was
a
little
humiliating
for
only
a
month
ago
flossie
had
said
to
her
in
strictest
confidence
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
ada
that
he
going
to
come
forward
this
spring
ada
laughed
coarsely
but
not
unkindly
at
the
tale
of
her
perplexity
ada
had
every
reason
to
be
sympathetic
for
rickman
once
securely
attached
spinks
would
be
lonely
unappropriated
free
do
you
worry
said
she
all
right
all
right
ca
you
see
how
frightfully
rude
he
is
to
me
i
should
think
i
did
see
it
a
jolly
lot
you
know
about
gentlemen
you
nothing
to
go
on
when
they
so
everlastingly
polite
but
when
they
turn
mad
like
that
all
of
a
sudden
you
may
be
sure
coming
to
the
point
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
did
use
to
think
you
very
much
chance
flossie
but
when
i
saw
him
walk
out
of
the
room
the
other
day
i
said
to
myself
got
i
wish
i
knew
i
do
want
it
hanging
on
for
ever
it
wo
if
he
does
propose
in
may
he
will
in
june
when
got
a
new
dress
and
a
new
hat
flossie
shook
her
head
despairingly
i
wonder
said
she
what
really
better
do
i
think
sometimes
i
better
go
away
well
sometimes
that
fetch
them
and
then
again
sometimes
it
does
it
risky
some
girls
she
added
reflectively
try
doing
their
hair
another
way
but
i
would
if
i
was
you
that
risky
too
if
they
really
fond
of
you
as
often
as
not
it
only
puts
them
off
then
what
i
to
do
if
you
take
my
advice
said
miss
bishop
you
not
do
anything
you
just
go
on
the
same
as
before
as
if
you
had
noticed
anything
out
of
the
way
and
flossie
went
on
just
the
same
as
before
with
the
result
that
every
morning
rickman
sighed
more
and
more
heavily
as
he
heard
the
early
patter
of
those
feet
upon
the
floor
chapter
xlvi
flossie
had
been
working
with
one
eye
on
the
clock
all
afternoon
at
the
closing
hour
she
went
out
into
lothbury
with
the
other
girls
but
instead
of
going
up
moorgate
street
as
usual
she
turned
out
of
prince
street
to
her
right
and
thence
made
her
way
westward
as
quickly
as
she
could
for
the
crowd
it
was
september
a
day
when
it
was
good
to
be
out
of
doors
at
that
hour
the
sunlight
filtered
into
the
dusty
thoroughfare
from
the
west
on
her
left
the
sprawling
mounted
legends
over
the
shops
were
so
many
gold
blazons
on
an
endless
field
of
grey
on
her
right
a
little
way
ahead
the
tall
in
wood
street
hung
out
its
green
leaves
over
cheapside
like
a
signal
thither
flossie
was
bound
as
she
sidled
out
of
the
throng
into
the
quiet
little
lane
rickman
came
forward
raising
his
hat
he
had
been
waiting
under
the
for
twenty
minutes
and
was
now
beguiling
his
sylvan
solitude
with
a
cigarette
two
years
had
worked
a
considerable
change
in
his
appearance
his
face
had
grown
graver
and
clearer
cut
he
had
lost
his
hectic
look
and
had
more
the
air
of
a
man
of
the
world
than
of
a
young
poet
about
town
to
flossie
admiration
and
delight
he
wore
an
irreproachable
and
shining
linen
she
interpreted
these
changes
as
corresponding
with
the
improvement
in
his
prospects
and
judged
that
the
profession
of
literature
was
answering
fairly
well
they
shook
hands
seriously
as
if
they
attached
importance
to
these
trifles
am
i
dreadfully
late
she
asked
dreadfully
he
smiled
with
one
corner
of
his
mouth
holding
his
cigarette
firmly
in
the
other
while
he
took
from
her
the
little
cape
she
carried
over
her
arm
i
expect
i
kept
you
waiting
a
good
bit
a
keen
observer
of
flossie
face
might
have
detected
in
it
a
faintly
triumphant
appreciation
of
the
fact
i
awfully
sorry
i
got
and
had
to
stay
till
i
finished
up
never
mind
flossie
it
do
matter
at
any
rate
it
worth
it
the
words
implied
that
rickman
time
was
valuable
otherwise
he
would
not
have
given
it
to
flossie
where
shall
we
go
and
what
shall
we
do
i
do
much
care
shall
we
have
tea
somewhere
while
we
making
up
our
minds
well
i
would
mind
i
had
time
to
get
any
at
the
bank
all
right
come
along
and
they
plunged
into
cheapside
again
he
breasting
the
stream
making
a
passage
for
her
they
found
a
favourite
confectioner
in
paul
churchyard
where
they
had
sometimes
gone
before
he
noticed
that
she
took
her
seat
with
rather
a
weary
air
floss
you
must
come
for
a
walk
on
the
embankment
you
look
as
if
you
did
get
out
enough
why
will
you
go
up
and
down
in
that
abominable
underground
you
awfully
white
you
know
i
never
had
a
red
face
then
what
the
matter
nothing
i
shall
be
better
when
i
had
my
tea
she
had
her
tea
which
after
a
proper
protest
on
her
part
was
paid
for
by
rickman
then
they
turned
into
the
cathedral
gardens
where
it
was
still
pleasant
under
the
trees
thus
approached
from
the
the
building
rose
up
before
them
in
detached
incoherent
masses
the
curve
of
its
great
dome
broken
by
the
line
of
the
north
transept
seen
obliquely
from
below
it
turned
a
forbidding
face
citywards
a
face
of
sallow
stone
blackened
by
immemorial
grime
while
the
columns
of
the
portico
shone
almost
white
against
the
nearer
gloom
it
clever
of
it
to
look
so
beautiful
murmured
rickman
when
so
infernally
ugly
he
stood
for
a
few
minutes
lost
in
admiration
of
its
eccentricity
thus
interested
he
was
not
aware
that
his
own
expression
had
grown
somewhat
abstracted
impersonal
and
cold
i
call
that
silly
said
flossie
looking
at
him
out
of
the
corner
of
her
black
eyes
had
he
come
there
to
pay
attention
to
the
cathedral
do
you
why
because
i
suppose
you
would
say
i
was
beautiful
if
i
were
well
downright
ugly
i
might
flossie
if
your
ugliness
was
as
characteristic
as
suggestive
as
this
flossie
shrugged
her
shoulders
not
he
thought
a
pretty
action
in
a
lady
with
so
short
a
neck
to
her
paul
was
about
as
beautiful
as
the
bank
and
infinitely
less
suggestive
rickman
interpreted
her
apathy
as
fatigue
and
looked
about
for
a
lonely
seat
they
found
one
under
the
angle
of
the
transept
let
sit
down
here
he
said
better
not
exert
ourselves
violently
so
soon
after
tea
for
all
the
tea
i
had
it
would
matter
said
flossie
as
if
resenting
an
ignoble
implication
rickman
laughed
a
little
uncomfortably
and
blushed
perhaps
she
had
hardly
given
him
the
right
to
concern
himself
with
these
intimate
matters
yet
from
the
very
first
his
feeling
for
flossie
had
shown
itself
in
minute
cares
for
her
physical
they
sat
for
a
while
in
silence
a
man
passed
them
smoking
he
turned
his
head
to
look
back
at
the
girl
and
the
flying
ash
from
his
cigarette
lighted
on
her
dress
confound
the
brute
said
rickman
trying
to
brush
away
the
obnoxious
powder
with
a
touch
which
would
have
been
more
effectual
if
it
had
been
less
of
a
caress
she
shivered
slightly
and
he
put
her
cape
gently
about
her
shoulders
a
curious
garment
flossie
cape
made
of
some
thin
stuff
with
gold
braid
on
the
collar
cheap
pretty
and
a
little
vulgar
there
not
much
warmth
in
that
thing
he
said
feeling
it
with
his
fingers
i
do
want
to
be
warm
thank
you
a
day
like
this
she
retorted
pushing
back
the
cape
for
though
it
was
no
longer
spring
dream
tugged
at
her
heartstrings
there
was
a
dull
anger
against
him
in
her
heart
at
that
moment
flossie
could
have
fought
savagely
for
her
dream
what
could
have
made
her
so
irritable
poor
little
girl
she
look
well
or
perhaps
it
was
her
work
he
was
sorry
for
all
women
who
worked
and
flossie
she
was
such
an
utter
woman
that
touch
of
exaggeration
in
the
curves
of
her
soft
figure
made
her
irresistibly
superlatively
feminine
to
be
sure
as
he
had
hinted
in
that
unguarded
moment
her
beauty
was
of
the
kind
that
suggests
nothing
more
interesting
than
itself
yet
there
were
times
when
it
had
power
over
him
when
he
was
helpless
and
stupid
before
it
and
now
as
he
leaned
back
looking
at
her
his
intellect
seemed
to
melt
away
gradually
and
merge
in
dreamy
sense
they
sat
for
a
while
still
without
speaking
then
he
suddenly
bent
forward
gazing
into
her
eyes
what
is
it
flossie
tell
me
flossie
turned
away
her
face
from
the
excited
face
approaching
it
tell
me
it
nothing
ca
you
see
i
only
tired
i
a
hard
day
i
thought
you
never
had
hard
days
at
the
bank
no
no
more
we
do
not
to
speak
of
then
it
something
you
do
like
to
speak
of
i
say
have
the
other
women
been
worrying
you
no
i
should
think
not
indeed
catch
any
one
trying
that
on
with
me
then
i
ca
see
what
it
can
be
i
daresay
you
ca
you
do
know
what
it
is
it
not
much
but
it
the
same
thing
day
after
day
day
after
day
till
i
sick
and
tired
of
it
all
i
do
see
any
end
to
it
either
i
so
sorry
floss
said
rickman
in
a
queer
thick
voice
she
had
turned
her
face
towards
him
now
and
its
expression
was
inscrutable
to
him
to
another
man
it
would
have
said
that
it
was
all
very
well
for
him
to
be
sorry
he
could
put
a
stop
to
it
soon
enough
if
he
liked
oh
you
need
be
sorry
why
not
do
you
think
i
do
care
immense
play
of
expression
on
flossie
face
she
bit
her
lip
and
that
meant
that
he
might
care
no
end
or
he
might
care
a
rap
how
was
she
to
know
she
smiled
a
bitter
smile
as
much
as
to
say
that
she
know
neither
did
she
greatly
care
then
her
lips
quivered
which
meant
that
if
by
any
chance
he
did
care
it
was
a
cruel
shame
to
leave
a
poor
girl
in
the
dark
care
about
the
bank
she
said
at
last
you
need
i
stand
it
much
longer
i
shall
fling
it
up
some
of
these
days
see
if
i
do
would
that
be
wise
i
do
know
whether
it
wise
or
not
i
know
i
ca
go
on
like
this
for
ever
yes
but
would
anything
else
be
better
or
even
half
as
good
you
did
get
much
fun
out
of
that
last
place
you
know
well
for
all
the
fun
i
get
out
of
that
old
bank
i
might
as
well
be
in
a
ladies
boarding
school
if
i
thought
it
would
end
in
anything
but
it
wo
how
do
you
know
it
may
end
in
your
marrying
a
big
fat
manager
do
be
silly
supposing
you
knew
it
would
end
some
day
not
necessarily
in
marrying
the
manager
would
you
mind
going
on
with
it
she
looked
away
from
him
and
tears
formed
under
her
eyelashes
the
vague
light
tears
that
never
fall
there
no
use
my
talking
of
flinging
it
up
i
fixed
there
for
good
who
knows
said
rickman
and
if
flossie
eyes
had
been
candid
they
would
have
said
you
ought
to
know
if
anybody
does
whatever
they
said
it
made
him
shudder
with
fear
with
shame
but
no
not
with
hatred
poor
flossie
he
said
gently
and
there
was
a
pause
during
which
flossie
looked
more
demure
than
ever
after
her
little
outburst
she
had
seen
the
look
in
his
eyes
that
foreboded
flight
he
rose
abruptly
do
you
know
i
awfully
sorry
but
i
got
an
appointment
at
half
past
five
to
meet
a
fellow
in
fleet
street
the
fellow
was
maddox
but
the
appointment
he
had
made
it
that
very
minute
which
was
the
minute
past
five
they
went
their
ways
he
to
fleet
street
and
she
home
maddox
did
not
turn
up
to
the
appointment
and
rickman
had
to
keep
it
with
himself
as
the
result
of
the
interview
he
determined
to
try
the
effect
of
a
little
timely
absence
he
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
from
himself
that
he
was
really
most
horribly
afraid
his
state
of
mind
or
rather
body
for
the
disorder
was
purely
physical
was
such
that
he
positively
dared
not
remain
in
the
same
house
with
flossie
another
day
what
he
needed
was
change
of
air
and
scene
he
approached
downey
with
a
air
and
a
tale
of
how
he
was
seedy
and
thought
if
he
could
get
away
for
a
week
it
would
set
him
up
it
seemed
to
him
that
downey
manner
conveyed
the
most
perfect
comprehension
of
his
condition
he
did
not
care
he
was
brought
so
low
that
he
could
almost
have
confided
in
downey
mark
my
words
said
the
wise
woman
to
the
he
be
back
again
before
the
week
up
and
as
usual
little
flossie
marked
them
he
walked
out
to
hampstead
that
very
evening
and
engaged
rooms
there
by
the
week
on
the
understanding
that
he
might
require
them
for
a
month
or
more
he
did
not
certainly
know
how
long
the
cure
would
take
hampstead
is
a
charming
and
salubrious
suburb
and
jewdwine
was
really
very
decent
to
him
while
he
was
there
but
in
four
days
he
had
had
more
of
the
cure
than
he
wanted
or
was
it
that
he
did
want
to
be
cured
anyway
a
week
was
enough
to
prove
that
the
flight
to
hampstead
was
a
mistake
he
had
now
an
opportunity
of
observing
miss
flossie
from
a
judicious
distance
with
the
result
that
her
image
was
seen
through
a
tender
wash
of
atmosphere
at
the
precise
moment
when
it
acquired
relief
he
began
to
miss
her
morning
greetings
the
soft
touch
of
her
hand
when
they
said
and
the
voice
that
seemed
to
be
always
saying
how
good
of
you
thanks
rickman
i
had
a
lovely
day
he
had
given
her
many
lovely
days
lately
poor
little
girl
at
the
end
of
the
week
coming
up
from
fleet
street
instead
of
making
straight
for
the
hampstead
road
as
he
ought
to
have
done
he
found
himself
turning
aside
in
the
direction
of
tavistock
place
the
excuse
that
he
made
to
himself
was
that
he
wanted
a
book
that
he
had
left
behind
at
downey
now
it
was
not
in
the
least
likely
that
he
had
left
it
in
the
nor
yet
in
the
but
it
was
in
those
places
that
he
thought
of
looking
first
not
finding
what
he
wanted
he
went
on
dejectedly
to
the
second
floor
feeling
that
he
must
fulfil
the
quest
that
justified
his
presence
and
there
in
his
study
in
yes
it
as
far
in
as
anybody
could
get
by
the
bookcase
next
the
window
flossie
was
sitting
and
sitting
if
you
could
believe
it
on
the
floor
sitting
and
moving
her
hands
along
the
shelves
as
familiarly
as
you
please
good
heavens
if
she
was
busy
dusting
his
books
flossie
did
see
him
for
she
had
her
back
to
the
door
and
he
stood
there
on
the
threshold
for
a
second
just
looking
at
her
she
wore
a
loose
overall
evidently
intended
to
wrap
her
up
and
conceal
her
but
so
far
from
concealing
her
the
overall
tucked
in
and
smoothed
out
and
altogether
adorably
moulded
by
her
crouching
attitude
betrayed
the
full
but
tender
outline
of
her
body
her
face
all
but
the
white
curve
of
her
cheek
and
forehead
was
hidden
from
him
but
he
could
see
the
ivory
bistre
at
the
nape
of
her
bowed
neck
with
the
delicate
black
tendrils
of
her
curls
clustering
above
it
her
throat
as
she
stooped
over
her
task
was
puckered
and
gathered
like
some
incredibly
soft
stuff
in
little
folds
under
her
chin
he
drew
in
his
breath
with
a
sighing
sound
which
to
flossie
was
the
first
intimation
of
his
presence
to
say
that
flossie
rose
to
her
feet
would
be
a
misleading
description
of
her
method
she
held
on
to
the
edge
of
a
bookshelf
by
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
drew
herself
up
from
the
floor
slowly
as
it
were
by
some
mysterious
unfolding
process
not
ungraceful
she
turned
on
him
the
wide
eyes
of
a
child
caught
this
time
in
some
superb
enormity
flossie
he
said
with
an
affectation
of
severity
what
you
been
doing
she
produced
her
duster
gingerly
you
can
see
said
she
only
i
did
mean
you
to
catch
me
at
it
she
knelt
down
by
the
fireplace
and
gave
her
duster
a
little
flick
up
the
chimney
i
never
never
in
all
my
life
saw
such
a
lot
of
dust
i
ca
think
how
you
gone
on
living
with
it
he
smiled
no
more
can
i
flossie
i
do
know
how
i
did
it
well
you
have
got
to
do
it
now
it
all
perfectly
sweet
and
clean
it
all
perfectly
sweet
i
know
that
dear
she
turned
towards
the
door
but
not
without
a
dissatisfied
look
back
at
the
bookcase
she
had
left
are
you
going
to
let
me
thank
you
you
need
i
was
only
helping
mrs
downey
oh
she
been
having
a
grand
while
you
were
away
the
deuce
she
has
oh
you
need
be
frightened
nobody
touched
your
precious
books
but
me
i
would
let
them
why
would
you
let
them
oh
i
say
it
six
are
you
going
to
stay
perhaps
why
because
i
only
one
more
shelf
to
dust
and
then
i
finished
i
i
in
rather
a
hurry
why
wo
you
stay
and
dust
it
now
well
you
know
she
took
one
step
inside
the
room
timidly
then
another
and
stood
still
is
it
me
you
afraid
of
i
sit
outside
on
the
stairs
if
rather
how
silly
she
removed
an
invisible
atom
of
dust
from
a
chair
as
she
spoke
as
much
as
to
say
she
was
inspired
solely
by
the
instinct
of
order
the
diminutive
smile
played
about
the
corners
of
her
mouth
miss
roots
said
i
better
not
meddle
with
your
books
did
she
then
miss
roots
is
a
beast
she
seemed
to
think
i
did
know
how
to
dust
them
perhaps
she
right
i
say
suppose
you
let
me
see
and
flossie
willingly
cajoled
began
again
and
as
he
saw
with
horror
on
his
hoarded
relics
of
the
harden
library
no
flossie
he
said
with
a
queer
change
in
his
voice
not
those
but
fingers
moved
along
their
tops
with
a
delicacy
born
of
the
incessant
manipulation
of
bank
notes
all
the
same
she
did
do
it
wrong
for
she
dusted
towards
the
backs
instead
of
away
from
them
but
he
had
the
heart
to
correct
her
he
watched
a
moment
then
he
pretended
to
be
looking
for
the
book
he
had
pretended
he
wanted
to
find
then
he
sat
down
and
pretended
to
write
a
letter
whilst
flossie
went
on
dusting
skilfully
delicately
she
even
managed
to
get
through
ten
volumes
of
his
own
bekker
plato
without
damage
to
the
beautiful
but
perishing
russia
leather
that
made
it
all
the
more
singular
that
the
back
of
the
eleventh
volume
should
come
off
suddenly
with
a
rip
she
gave
a
little
cry
of
dismay
he
looked
up
and
she
came
to
him
holding
the
book
in
one
hand
and
its
back
in
the
other
she
really
was
a
little
frightened
look
she
said
i
did
think
it
would
have
gone
and
done
like
that
oh
i
say
flossie
i
sorry
her
mouth
dropped
not
unbecomingly
her
eyes
were
so
liquid
that
he
could
have
sworn
they
had
tears
in
them
she
looked
more
than
ever
like
an
unhappy
child
standing
beside
him
in
her
long
straight
overall
and
i
would
let
anybody
look
at
them
but
me
why
would
you
i
asked
you
that
before
flossie
why
you
he
took
the
book
and
its
mutilated
fragment
from
her
and
held
both
her
hands
in
his
because
i
knew
you
were
fond
enough
of
and
is
there
anything
i
was
fond
enough
of
do
you
think
i
do
think
i
know
no
you
know
nothing
you
know
nothing
at
all
about
anything
what
you
think
i
thought
you
hated
me
hated
you
yes
hated
me
like
poison
he
put
his
arms
about
her
gathering
her
to
him
he
drew
her
head
down
over
his
heart
i
hate
you
like
this
and
this
and
this
he
said
kissing
in
turn
her
forehead
her
eyelids
and
her
mouth
he
held
her
at
arm
length
and
gazed
at
her
as
if
he
wondered
whether
they
were
the
same
woman
the
flossie
he
had
once
known
and
this
flossie
that
he
had
kissed
then
he
led
her
to
the
sofa
and
drew
her
down
by
his
side
and
held
her
hands
to
keep
her
there
and
yet
he
felt
that
it
was
he
who
was
being
led
he
who
was
being
drawn
he
who
was
being
held
over
the
brink
of
the
immeasurable
inexpiable
folly
in
all
this
his
genius
remained
alone
and
apart
unmoved
by
anything
he
did
or
said
as
if
it
knew
that
through
it
all
the
golden
chain
still
held
her
mouth
quivered
if
you
did
hate
me
why
were
you
so
rude
to
me
then
was
the
first
thing
she
said
because
i
loved
you
when
i
did
want
to
love
you
and
it
was
more
than
i
could
stand
and
because
because
i
did
know
it
but
knew
it
he
said
almost
savagely
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
tongue
refused
the
guidance
of
his
brain
i
sure
i
did
know
anything
of
the
sort
her
mouth
quivered
again
but
this
time
it
was
with
a
smile
why
not
because
i
did
say
so
in
a
lot
of
stupid
words
you
literal
but
surely
you
understood
not
just
at
first
of
course
i
did
care
a
bit
at
first
i
did
care
till
long
after
long
after
what
flossie
was
thinking
of
miss
poppy
grace
on
the
balcony
next
door
never
mind
what
flossie
knew
all
about
miss
poppy
grace
and
she
did
mind
at
all
would
i
be
here
now
if
i
did
love
you
he
still
had
to
persuade
himself
that
this
was
love
it
seemed
incredible
rubbish
you
know
you
only
came
to
look
at
those
silly
old
books
said
flossie
nodding
contemptuously
towards
the
bookcase
did
you
imagine
i
was
in
love
with
them
and
think
of
all
the
things
we
done
together
did
you
know
did
you
feel
it
coming
on
i
know
you
been
good
but
as
for
anything
else
sure
i
thought
of
it
then
think
of
it
now
or
does
that
mean
that
you
do
care
for
me
there
was
an
awful
pause
then
flossie
said
very
indistinctly
so
indistinctly
that
he
had
to
lean
his
face
to
hers
to
catch
the
words
no
of
course
it
does
her
voice
cleared
suddenly
but
if
you
did
hate
me
why
did
you
go
away
i
went
away
because
i
was
and
are
you
any
better
yes
i
think
i
better
i
think
i
nearly
all
right
now
i
might
say
i
undertake
never
to
be
ill
again
at
least
not
if
marry
me
at
these
words
his
genius
turned
and
looked
at
him
with
eyes
ominous
and
aghast
he
had
a
vision
of
another
woman
kneeling
beside
a
hearth
as
her
hands
tended
a
dying
fire
and
he
hardly
saw
the
woman
at
his
side
as
he
drew
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
again
because
of
the
pain
at
his
heart
and
flossie
wondered
why
in
that
moment
he
did
not
look
at
her
he
was
looking
now
and
as
he
looked
his
genius
hid
his
face
you
knew
that
was
what
i
wanted
she
shook
her
head
slowly
what
does
that
mean
that
you
did
know
or
that
you
wo
but
you
will
flossie
as
he
drew
her
to
him
a
second
time
the
old
terror
woke
in
his
heart
but
only
for
a
moment
for
this
time
flossie
kissed
him
of
her
own
accord
with
a
kiss
not
passionate
like
his
own
but
sweet
and
fugitive
it
was
like
a
reminder
of
the
transience
of
the
thing
he
sought
a
challenge
rousing
him
to
assert
its
immortality
he
put
her
from
him
and
stooped
over
his
own
outstretched
arms
and
clasped
hands
staring
stupidly
at
the
floor
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
hardly
incisively
as
a
man
speaks
the
truth
he
hates
do
you
know
what
this
means
it
means
waiting
waiting
yes
i
not
a
bit
well
off
you
know
i
could
give
you
the
sort
of
home
you
ought
to
have
just
yet
i
no
business
to
say
anything
about
it
but
somehow
i
thought
you
rather
know
and
of
course
no
business
to
ask
you
but
will
you
wait
well
if
we
must
we
must
and
if
it
means
working
at
that
beastly
bank
for
another
year
do
you
think
you
can
keep
it
up
so
long
i
try
to
she
leaned
towards
him
and
they
sat
there
holding
each
hands
looking
into
each
other
eyes
hearing
nothing
feeling
nothing
but
the
beating
of
their
own
riotous
hearts
it
was
love
as
nature
loves
to
have
it
it
was
also
what
men
call
honest
love
but
in
the
days
when
he
had
loved
dishonestly
he
had
never
slipped
from
poppy
grace
side
with
such
a
sense
of
misery
and
solitude
and
shame
chapter
xlvii
the
game
was
over
and
flossie
had
won
she
had
forced
fate
hand
or
rather
mr
rickman
not
by
any
coarse
premeditated
methods
flossie
was
too
subtly
feminine
for
that
she
had
trusted
rather
to
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
and
when
her
beautiful
womanly
emotions
gave
her
the
opening
she
had
simply
followed
it
that
was
all
and
could
anything
have
been
more
correct
she
had
not
given
herself
away
once
by
word
or
look
with
true
maidenly
modesty
she
had
hidden
her
own
feelings
until
she
was
perfectly
sure
of
rickman
there
was
nothing
nothing
to
make
her
feel
ashamed
when
she
looked
back
upon
that
day
a
reflection
from
which
she
derived
much
consolation
afterwards
it
gave
her
courage
to
fly
downstairs
to
downey
private
room
where
that
lady
sat
doing
her
accounts
to
lean
over
the
back
of
downey
chair
and
to
whisper
into
her
ear
i
been
dusting
rickman
books
he
caught
me
at
it
downey
could
not
have
shown
more
excitement
if
flossie
had
told
her
that
the
kitchen
boiler
had
burst
flossie
my
goodness
whatever
did
he
say
he
did
mind
one
bit
only
you
wo
tell
him
you
told
me
not
to
touch
them
will
you
mrs
downey
she
brought
her
soft
blushing
cheek
close
to
downey
and
the
warmth
of
it
told
her
tale
and
downey
promised
not
to
tell
pardoning
the
subterfuge
for
love
sake
which
excuses
all
has
he
gone
flossie
she
inquired
anxiously
no
he
not
going
he
come
back
for
good
there
did
i
say
he
would
and
what
think
said
flossie
sitting
down
and
spreading
her
plump
arm
on
the
secretary
all
over
the
accounts
he
done
it
he
did
it
up
there
downey
stared
and
flossie
nodded
as
much
as
to
say
fact
you
do
mean
to
say
so
nobody
more
surprised
than
myself
the
rest
was
kisses
and
congratulations
wholly
magnanimous
on
downey
part
for
the
announcement
of
flossie
engagement
cost
her
one
of
the
gayest
most
desirable
and
most
remunerative
of
her
brilliant
circle
spinks
regarded
by
himself
and
everybody
else
as
permanent
gave
notice
and
vanished
from
that
hour
carrying
with
him
the
hopes
of
miss
ada
bishop
meanwhile
flossie
hitherto
regarded
from
a
merely
decorative
point
of
view
became
a
person
of
considerable
importance
in
the
it
was
not
merely
that
she
was
an
engaged
young
lady
for
as
miss
bishop
pointed
out
to
her
with
some
natural
asperity
anybody
can
be
engaged
but
she
had
now
the
privilege
denied
to
any
other
boarder
of
going
in
and
out
of
rickman
study
she
said
that
she
went
in
to
tidy
it
but
strange
to
say
the
more
flossie
tidied
it
the
more
hopeless
it
became
rickman
study
was
never
what
you
might
call
a
really
tidy
room
but
at
any
rate
there
had
always
been
a
certain
repose
about
it
and
now
you
could
not
well
imagine
a
more
unrestful
place
a
place
more
suggestive
of
hurry
and
disorder
of
an
utter
lack
of
the
leisure
in
which
ideas
ripen
and
grow
great
the
table
had
become
a
troubled
sea
of
primeval
manuscript
where
rickman
sat
with
his
head
in
his
hands
brooding
over
the
face
of
the
waters
he
had
once
profanely
said
that
god
world
was
a
chaos
he
had
got
to
work
on
now
it
was
world
that
was
chaos
a
tempestuous
chaos
where
things
to
be
weltered
in
the
wreck
of
things
that
were
rickman
genius
like
nature
destroyed
in
order
that
it
might
create
yet
it
seemed
to
him
that
nowadays
the
destruction
was
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
creation
he
sighed
as
he
gazed
at
the
piteous
fragments
that
represented
six
months
labour
fragments
that
wept
blood
the
torn
and
mutilated
limbs
of
living
thoughts
with
here
and
there
huge
torsos
of
blank
verse
lopped
and
hewn
in
the
omnipotent
fury
of
a
god
at
war
with
his
world
mixed
up
with
undeveloped
and
ethereal
shapes
the
embryos
of
dreams
and
yet
it
was
not
altogether
the
divine
rage
of
the
artist
that
had
wrought
this
havoc
the
confusion
argued
a
power
at
war
with
itself
rather
than
with
its
creations
the
very
vastness
of
it
all
suggested
a
deity
tied
as
to
time
but
apparently
unshackled
as
to
space
that
was
it
there
really
was
as
much
time
as
there
used
to
be
it
was
in
his
free
evenings
and
on
sundays
that
his
best
thoughts
came
to
him
the
beautiful
shy
thoughts
that
must
be
delicately
courted
and
now
his
free
evenings
and
his
sundays
were
given
up
to
the
courting
of
flossie
and
even
on
a
this
was
what
would
happen
he
would
rush
home
early
from
fleet
street
and
settle
down
for
two
hours
work
before
dinner
then
a
little
timid
knock
would
be
heard
at
the
door
and
flossie
would
come
in
bringing
him
a
cup
of
tea
he
could
just
swill
it
down
like
a
pig
and
send
the
dear
little
thing
away
he
to
let
her
sit
and
see
him
drink
it
slowly
as
if
he
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
or
he
would
come
in
as
on
that
blessed
evening
six
months
ago
and
find
flossie
dusting
books
standing
perhaps
on
two
tottering
hassocks
and
a
chair
at
an
altitude
perilous
to
so
plump
a
person
and
flossie
had
to
be
lifted
down
from
the
hassocks
and
punished
with
hard
kisses
and
told
not
to
do
it
again
and
flossie
would
do
it
again
so
that
a
great
deal
of
time
was
lost
in
this
way
and
with
the
touch
of
those
soft
little
arms
about
his
neck
demoralization
would
set
in
for
the
evening
and
then
there
was
flossie
education
to
be
attended
to
and
that
took
more
time
than
anything
it
meant
that
as
the
november
days
drew
in
he
had
to
read
or
talk
to
flossie
as
she
sat
in
his
armchair
with
her
dear
little
feet
on
his
fender
and
her
dear
little
hands
mending
his
socks
and
shirts
and
things
they
might
have
been
married
for
years
only
they
were
that
was
what
made
it
so
exciting
hands
were
always
mending
or
making
something
generally
something
to
wear
and
it
was
rather
strange
that
it
never
occurred
to
such
a
busy
person
that
other
people
might
be
busy
too
he
tried
to
break
it
to
her
he
told
her
like
a
brute
that
he
thought
all
his
things
must
be
mended
now
and
that
perhaps
for
another
week
he
would
be
better
without
any
tea
and
flossie
very
naturally
offended
did
put
her
dear
little
nose
in
at
his
door
for
two
weeks
and
for
all
you
could
get
through
in
that
time
it
was
hardly
worth
while
offending
her
but
he
was
very
far
wrong
in
supposing
that
flossie
never
thought
about
his
work
she
had
been
thinking
a
great
deal
about
it
lately
one
cold
bright
sunday
morning
in
november
she
tapped
at
his
door
and
walked
in
dressed
for
the
open
air
are
you
coming
for
a
walk
she
said
this
lovely
day
too
busy
to
signify
his
annoyance
or
to
keep
himself
from
temptation
he
bent
closer
over
the
article
he
was
writing
for
she
came
and
stood
beside
him
watching
him
as
he
worked
still
with
his
air
of
passionate
preoccupation
presently
he
found
himself
drawn
against
his
will
into
the
following
conversation
how
long
does
it
take
you
to
do
one
of
those
things
it
depends
depends
on
what
oh
on
the
amount
of
trouble
i
take
over
it
and
do
they
pay
you
any
more
for
taking
trouble
no
flossie
i
sorry
to
say
they
frequently
pay
me
less
then
why
on
earth
do
you
do
it
this
question
seemed
to
him
so
curious
that
it
caused
him
to
look
up
beholding
for
the
first
time
the
plump
figure
clothed
entirely
in
a
new
suit
of
brown
and
wearing
on
its
head
a
fascinating
hat
made
of
something
that
resembled
fur
he
tried
to
look
at
it
with
disapproval
while
his
mind
dealt
independently
with
the
amazing
question
put
to
him
well
flossie
if
you
really
care
anything
about
style
style
she
stroked
down
the
front
of
her
jacket
with
a
delicious
movement
of
her
little
hands
do
you
like
it
he
smiled
i
adore
it
it
makes
you
look
like
a
dear
little
brown
beaver
as
you
are
the
beaver
was
only
one
of
the
many
names
he
had
for
her
it
was
suggested
irresistibly
by
her
plumpness
her
singularly
practical
intelligence
and
her
secretive
ways
then
what
do
you
mean
by
style
asked
the
beaver
in
a
challenging
tone
that
forced
him
to
lay
down
his
pen
what
do
i
mean
by
style
he
explained
moved
by
the
mad
lust
for
mystification
which
seizes
a
man
in
the
presence
of
adorable
simplicity
i
do
mean
anything
in
the
least
resembling
a
coat
there
really
is
any
style
about
a
beaver
coat
and
if
you
want
me
to
say
it
the
clothing
of
your
thoughts
i
wo
the
less
clothing
they
have
the
better
it
ca
be
treated
as
a
beaver
treats
its
coats
you
can
put
it
on
and
off
i
was
putting
it
on
when
you
came
in
and
interrupted
me
and
you
can
mend
it
and
brush
it
up
a
bit
but
you
ca
measure
it
or
make
it
to
order
and
when
it
wears
out
you
ca
get
another
where
you
got
the
first
style
is
the
clothing
it
the
body
of
your
thoughts
my
beaver
and
in
a
a
style
the
style
of
the
masters
style
you
ca
tell
the
body
from
the
soul
if
you
said
you
could
tell
the
body
from
the
skirt
it
would
sound
like
sense
that
remark
was
for
the
beaver
really
so
witty
that
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
at
it
but
the
beaver
was
in
no
laughing
humour
look
here
she
said
you
that
if
you
write
those
stylish
things
that
take
up
such
a
lot
of
time
they
only
pay
you
less
for
them
well
well
is
it
fair
of
you
to
go
on
writing
them
fair
of
my
dear
child
why
not
if
i
buy
stylish
things
i
to
pay
for
them
and
i
been
buying
them
long
enough
just
to
please
you
i
do
follow
but
i
suppose
a
beaver
has
to
reason
backwards
because
you
know
all
its
intelligence
is
in
its
tail
gracious
keith
you
are
a
silly
i
am
not
alone
in
my
opinion
it
the
opinion
of
some
very
eminent
zoologists
he
drew
her
gently
on
his
knee
raised
her
veil
and
looked
into
her
eyes
they
were
as
he
had
often
had
occasion
to
notice
of
so
deep
and
black
a
black
that
the
iris
was
indistinguishable
from
the
pupil
and
this
blackness
limited
the
range
of
their
expression
they
could
only
tell
you
what
flossie
was
feeling
never
what
she
was
thinking
for
thought
requires
a
translucent
medium
and
the
light
of
flossie
eyes
was
all
on
the
surface
on
the
other
hand
the
turns
and
movements
of
her
body
were
always
a
sufficient
indication
of
the
attitude
of
her
mind
at
the
present
moment
sitting
on
keith
knee
her
pose
was
not
one
of
pure
complacency
but
holding
her
there
that
little
brown
beaver
his
own
unyielding
virile
body
deliciously
aware
of
the
strange
incredible
softness
of
hers
he
wondered
whether
it
were
possible
for
him
to
feel
anything
but
tender
to
a
creature
so
strangely
and
pathetically
made
positively
she
seemed
to
melt
and
grow
softer
by
sheer
contact
and
presently
she
smiled
a
sweet
diminutive
smile
that
did
uncover
more
than
two
of
her
little
white
teeth
oh
what
a
shame
it
is
to
treat
a
beaver
so
said
he
when
are
you
going
to
take
me
for
a
nice
walk
said
she
any
time
before
christmas
perhaps
but
you
must
build
on
it
i
do
see
that
i
can
build
on
anything
at
this
rate
i
suppose
a
beaver
ca
be
happy
unless
it
always
building
why
some
people
say
it
has
any
intelligence
at
all
they
wo
even
allow
that
it
can
build
they
think
its
architectural
talent
is
all
a
delusion
and
a
sham
because
it
builds
in
season
and
out
of
season
keep
it
in
your
study
and
it
will
make
a
moat
round
the
hearthrug
with
tobacco
pouches
and
manuscripts
and
boots
whatever
it
can
lay
its
hands
on
it
will
even
take
the
ideas
out
of
a
man
head
if
it
ca
find
anything
better
is
there
any
logic
in
an
animal
that
can
do
that
and
if
flossie
did
not
understand
the
drift
of
these
remarks
at
least
she
seemed
to
understand
the
kisses
that
punctuated
them
but
before
very
long
he
obtained
more
light
on
the
beaver
logic
and
owned
that
it
was
singularly
sound
they
managed
to
put
in
a
great
many
nice
walks
between
that
sunday
and
christmas
whenever
he
could
spare
time
rickman
made
a
point
of
meeting
flossie
at
the
end
of
her
day
work
he
generally
waited
at
the
corner
where
the
long
windowless
wall
of
the
bank
stretches
along
prince
street
iron
and
implacable
it
was
too
cold
now
to
sit
under
the
shadow
of
paul
sometimes
they
would
walk
home
along
holborn
sometimes
they
would
go
down
ludgate
hill
and
thence
on
to
the
embankment
it
was
certainly
better
for
flossie
to
be
out
of
doors
than
in
the
dingy
in
tavistock
place
they
could
talk
freely
in
the
less
crowded
and
it
was
surprising
the
things
they
still
found
to
say
to
each
other
all
about
nothing
every
trace
of
depression
had
vanished
she
walked
with
a
brisk
step
she
chatted
gaily
she
laughed
the
happiest
laughter
at
the
poorest
jokes
all
was
going
well
and
why
oh
why
could
he
not
let
well
alone
they
were
walking
on
the
embankment
one
day
and
she
for
such
a
correct
little
person
was
mad
with
mirth
when
he
broke
out
flossie
you
little
lunatic
you
might
be
going
to
marry
a
instead
of
a
journalist
i
going
to
marry
a
very
rich
man
for
me
for
you
darling
a
devilish
poor
one
i
afraid
oh
do
we
said
enough
about
that
yes
but
i
have
told
you
everything
do
you
know
i
might
have
been
fairly
well
off
by
now
if
i
only
chosen
now
there
was
no
need
whatever
for
him
to
make
that
revelation
he
was
driven
to
it
by
vanity
he
wanted
to
make
an
impression
he
wanted
flossie
to
see
him
in
all
his
moral
beauty
how
was
that
she
asked
with
interest
i
ca
tell
you
much
about
it
it
was
something
to
do
with
business
i
got
an
offer
of
a
thumping
big
partnership
three
years
ago
and
i
refused
it
he
had
made
an
impression
flossie
turned
on
him
a
look
of
wonder
a
look
uncertain
and
inscrutable
what
did
you
do
that
for
i
did
it
because
it
was
right
i
did
like
the
business
that
not
quite
the
same
thing
is
it
not
always
it
happened
to
be
in
this
case
why
what
sort
of
business
was
it
it
was
scavenging
and
it
was
burglary
exactly
it
was
he
hesitated
only
the
i
know
they
make
a
lot
of
money
that
way
they
make
too
much
for
my
taste
sometimes
besides
besides
what
they
had
turned
into
an
embrasure
of
the
parapet
to
discuss
this
question
they
stood
close
together
looking
over
the
river
it
is
my
trade
i
only
a
blooming
journalist
you
do
make
so
very
much
out
of
that
do
you
is
that
the
reason
why
we
have
to
wait
i
afraid
so
but
i
hope
i
shall
be
something
more
than
a
journalist
some
day
you
writing
do
you
yes
flossie
i
should
be
much
good
at
it
if
i
did
i
see
she
was
looking
eastwards
away
from
him
and
her
expression
had
changed
but
it
was
still
inscrutable
and
yet
by
the
turning
of
her
head
he
saw
her
mind
moving
towards
a
conclusion
but
it
was
impossible
to
say
whether
she
reached
it
by
the
slow
process
of
induction
or
by
woman
rapid
intuition
anyhow
she
had
reached
it
presently
she
spoke
again
could
you
still
get
that
thing
that
partnership
any
time
if
you
tried
any
time
but
i
not
going
to
try
she
turned
round
abruptly
with
an
air
of
almost
fierce
determination
well
if
get
an
offer
of
a
good
place
sha
refuse
it
i
shall
leave
the
bank
she
spoke
as
if
so
desperate
a
step
would
be
followed
by
the
instantaneous
collapse
of
that
institution
he
was
surprised
to
find
how
uneasy
this
threat
always
made
him
the
proverbial
safety
of
the
bank
had
impressed
him
in
more
ways
than
one
and
flossie
post
there
had
other
obvious
advantages
it
brought
her
into
contact
with
women
of
a
better
class
than
her
own
with
small
refinements
and
conventions
which
were
not
conspicuous
at
downey
let
me
implore
you
not
to
do
that
heaven
knows
i
hate
you
having
to
earn
your
own
living
at
all
but
i
rather
you
did
it
that
way
than
any
other
why
what
difference
would
it
make
to
you
i
should
like
to
know
it
makes
all
the
difference
if
i
know
you
doing
easy
work
not
slaving
yourself
to
death
as
some
girls
do
it
an
easy
berth
and
and
i
like
the
look
of
those
girls
i
saw
you
with
they
were
nice
i
rather
think
of
you
working
with
them
than
sitting
in
some
horrible
office
like
a
man
promise
me
you
wo
go
looking
out
for
anything
else
all
right
i
promise
no
but
on
your
honour
honour
bright
there
anything
for
a
quiet
life
they
turned
on
to
the
street
again
rickman
looked
at
his
watch
look
here
we
both
late
for
dinner
supposing
we
go
and
dine
somewhere
and
do
a
theatre
after
eh
oh
no
we
must
all
the
same
flossie
eyes
brightened
for
she
dearly
loved
the
play
why
not
because
i
do
think
perhaps
you
ought
to
you
mean
i
ca
afford
it
well
oh
i
fancy
even
a
journalist
income
will
run
to
that
it
did
run
to
that
and
to
a
hansom
afterwards
though
flossie
protested
dragging
at
his
arm
i
rather
walk
said
she
indeed
i
would
nonsense
come
bundle
in
please
please
let
me
walk
he
helped
her
in
and
closed
the
apron
sharply
he
was
annoyed
that
was
the
second
time
she
had
insisted
on
his
poverty
he
thought
she
had
a
little
too
much
the
air
of
preparing
herself
to
be
a
poor
man
wife
of
course
it
was
pretty
of
her
but
he
thought
it
would
have
been
prettier
still
if
she
had
let
it
alone
now
flossie
had
never
thought
of
him
as
a
poor
man
before
but
somehow
the
idea
of
the
good
income
he
might
have
had
and
made
him
appear
poor
by
comparison
she
lay
back
in
the
hansom
meditating
if
you
could
only
write
a
play
like
that
keith
what
a
lot
of
money
you
make
should
i
but
then
you
see
i
could
write
a
play
like
that
rubbish
i
do
believe
that
author
what
call
him
is
so
very
much
cleverer
than
you
thanks
he
bowed
ironically
well
i
mean
it
and
look
how
they
clapped
him
why
they
made
as
much
fuss
about
him
as
any
of
the
actors
i
say
would
you
like
to
hear
them
calling
author
and
then
clapping
h
oh
would
you
love
it
just
you
need
pretend
look
there
i
declare
i
split
my
glove
that
meant
as
flossie
had
calculated
a
new
pair
that
should
not
have
to
pay
for
if
clapped
me
i
would
flossie
i
should
need
all
the
consolation
i
could
get
if
i
written
as
bad
a
play
well
if
that
was
a
bad
play
i
like
to
see
a
good
one
i
take
you
to
a
good
one
some
day
soon
well
i
afraid
not
very
soon
he
smiled
for
the
play
he
thought
of
taking
her
to
was
not
yet
written
would
never
be
written
if
many
of
his
evenings
were
like
this
but
to
flossie
meditating
his
words
bore
only
one
interpretation
that
keith
was
really
very
much
worse
off
than
she
had
taken
him
to
be
as
they
lingered
on
the
doorstep
in
tavistock
place
a
young
man
approached
them
in
a
deprecating
manner
from
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
took
off
his
hat
to
flossie
hallo
spinks
said
rickman
that
you
razors
said
spinks
it
is
what
are
you
doing
here
oh
nothing
i
was
in
the
neighbourhood
and
i
thought
i
have
a
look
at
the
old
place
come
in
will
you
if
they
do
come
flossie
i
shall
to
use
my
not
thanks
it
a
bit
too
late
i
better
be
going
but
he
did
not
go
i
hope
said
flossie
politely
you
comfortable
where
you
are
now
oh
very
comfortable
very
comfortable
indeed
yet
his
voice
had
a
melancholy
sound
and
under
the
his
face
a
face
not
specially
designed
for
pathos
looked
limp
and
utterly
dejected
i
think
keith
said
flossie
you
better
ring
again
ringing
was
a
concession
to
propriety
that
flossie
insisted
on
and
he
approved
he
rang
again
and
downey
in
a
beautiful
wrapper
herself
opened
the
door
at
the
sight
of
spinks
she
gave
a
joyful
exclamation
and
invited
him
into
the
hall
they
left
him
there
what
up
asked
rickman
as
they
parted
on
his
landing
who
with
sidney
i
ca
tell
you
really
i
wonder
why
he
left
i
ca
tell
you
that
either
they
said
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
she
kissed
him
laughing
and
the
two
men
heard
it
echoing
in
their
dreams
that
mysterious
laughter
of
woman
which
is
as
the
ripple
over
the
face
of
the
deep
chapter
xlviii
isaac
rickman
stood
in
his
front
shop
at
the
close
of
a
slack
winter
day
he
looked
about
him
with
a
gaze
uncheered
by
the
contemplation
of
his
and
mahogany
and
as
he
looked
he
gathered
his
beard
into
a
serious
meditative
hand
not
as
of
old
but
with
a
certain
agitation
in
the
gesture
isaac
was
suffering
from
depression
so
was
the
every
year
the
pulse
of
business
beat
more
feebly
and
in
the
present
year
eighteen
it
was
almost
standing
still
isaac
had
seen
the
little
booksellers
one
by
one
go
under
but
their
failure
put
no
heart
into
him
and
now
the
wave
of
depression
was
swallowing
him
up
too
he
had
not
got
the
grip
of
the
london
he
would
never
build
any
more
gin
palaces
of
art
he
had
not
yet
freed
himself
from
the
power
of
pilkington
and
more
than
all
his
depression
the
mortgage
of
the
harden
library
weighed
heavily
on
his
soul
the
public
in
which
he
trusted
had
grown
tricky
and
he
found
that
even
capital
and
incomparable
personal
audacity
are
powerless
against
the
malignity
of
events
for
his
own
part
isaac
dated
his
decline
from
the
hour
of
his
defection
he
had
not
been
brought
to
this
pass
by
any
rashness
in
speculation
or
by
any
flaw
whatever
in
his
original
scheme
but
his
original
scheme
had
taken
for
granted
keith
collaboration
he
had
calculated
to
a
nicety
what
it
would
cost
him
to
build
up
his
fortunes
and
all
these
calculations
had
been
based
on
the
union
of
his
own
borrowed
capital
with
keith
brilliant
brains
and
keith
with
unimaginable
perfidy
had
removed
himself
and
his
brilliant
brains
at
the
crisis
of
the
start
isaac
thought
he
had
estimated
pretty
accurately
the
value
of
his
son
contribution
but
it
was
only
in
the
actual
experiment
of
separation
that
he
realized
the
difference
it
had
made
the
immediate
effect
of
the
blow
was
to
paralyse
the
department
as
far
as
new
books
went
isaac
was
fairly
safe
if
the
public
was
tricky
he
was
generally
up
to
its
tricks
but
with
books
you
never
knew
where
you
were
not
unless
you
had
made
a
special
study
of
the
subject
owing
to
his
defective
education
he
had
always
been
helpless
in
the
shop
liable
at
any
moment
to
be
by
one
of
those
innocent
student
fellows
who
go
poking
their
noses
everywhere
and
in
buying
he
was
still
more
at
a
disadvantage
he
had
grown
nervous
in
the
he
never
knew
what
to
do
there
and
when
he
did
it
it
was
generally
wrong
he
would
let
himself
be
outbidden
where
keith
would
have
carried
all
before
him
by
a
superb
if
reckless
persistence
but
if
business
was
at
its
worst
in
the
department
in
the
front
shop
there
was
a
sense
of
a
sadder
and
more
personal
desolation
rickman
was
no
longer
sought
after
it
had
ceased
to
be
the
rendezvous
of
affable
young
men
from
fleet
street
and
the
temple
the
customers
who
came
nowadays
were
of
another
sort
and
the
tone
of
the
business
was
changing
for
the
worse
the
spirit
that
something
illuminating
intimate
and
immortal
had
perished
from
the
place
at
first
isaac
had
not
been
able
to
take
its
departure
seriously
he
had
never
really
grasped
the
ground
of
that
disagreement
with
his
son
he
had
put
it
all
down
to
some
nonsense
about
a
woman
and
certain
hints
dropped
by
pilkington
supported
him
in
that
belief
keith
he
had
said
to
himself
would
come
back
when
his
belly
pinched
him
every
day
he
looked
to
see
him
crawling
through
the
big
swinging
doors
on
that
empty
belly
when
he
did
it
isaac
meant
to
take
him
back
instantly
unquestioned
unreproved
and
unreproached
his
triumph
would
be
so
complete
that
he
could
afford
that
magnanimity
but
keith
had
not
come
back
he
had
never
put
his
nose
inside
the
shop
from
that
day
to
this
he
called
to
see
his
father
now
and
again
on
a
sunday
for
isaac
no
longer
refused
to
admit
him
into
his
house
and
then
as
if
in
obedience
to
the
holy
conventions
that
ruled
in
the
little
villa
at
ilford
in
essex
no
allusion
was
made
to
the
business
that
had
driven
them
apart
in
the
same
spirit
isaac
sternly
refrained
from
inquiring
into
the
state
of
keith
finances
but
from
his
personal
appearance
he
gathered
that
if
keith
returned
to
the
shop
it
would
not
be
hunger
that
would
send
him
there
and
if
the
young
man
manner
had
not
suggested
the
unlikelihood
of
his
return
a
hint
to
that
effect
was
conveyed
by
his
clothes
they
were
the
symbols
of
prosperity
nay
more
of
a
social
advance
that
there
could
be
no
going
back
upon
isaac
had
only
to
look
at
him
to
realize
his
separation
the
thing
was
monstrous
incomprehensible
but
certain
but
it
was
in
keith
gaze
the
gaze
which
he
could
never
meet
so
disturbing
was
it
in
its
luminous
sincerity
that
he
read
the
signs
of
a
more
profound
and
spiritual
desertion
isaac
stood
pondering
these
things
in
the
front
shop
at
the
hour
of
closing
as
he
moved
drearily
away
the
lights
were
turned
out
one
by
one
behind
him
the
great
iron
shutters
went
up
with
a
clang
and
it
was
dark
in
rickman
that
evening
instead
of
hailing
a
liverpool
street
he
crossed
the
strand
and
walked
up
bow
street
and
so
into
bloomsbury
it
was
the
first
time
for
four
years
that
he
had
called
in
tavistock
place
he
used
to
go
up
alone
to
the
and
wait
there
till
keith
appeared
and
took
him
into
his
bedroom
on
the
second
floor
now
his
name
brought
an
obsequious
smile
to
the
maid
face
she
attended
him
upstairs
and
ushered
him
with
ceremony
into
a
luxurious
library
keith
was
writing
at
a
table
strewn
with
manuscripts
and
he
did
not
look
up
all
at
once
the
fell
on
his
fair
head
and
boyish
face
and
isaac
heart
yearned
towards
his
son
he
held
out
his
hand
and
smiled
after
his
fashion
but
said
no
word
the
grip
of
the
eager
young
hand
gave
him
hope
keith
drew
up
two
chairs
to
the
fire
the
chairs
were
very
deep
very
large
very
low
comfortable
beyond
isaac
dreams
of
comfort
keith
lay
back
in
his
graceful
in
his
abandoned
attitude
isaac
sat
up
very
straight
and
stiff
crushing
in
his
knees
the
soft
felt
hat
that
made
him
look
for
ever
like
a
methodist
parson
his
eyes
rested
heavily
on
the
littered
table
well
he
said
how
long
have
you
been
at
it
oh
ever
since
nine
in
the
morning
longer
hours
than
he
had
in
the
shop
and
i
two
more
hours
to
put
through
still
and
yet
he
had
received
him
gladly
it
does
look
quite
as
easy
as
making
catalogues
it
is
isaac
had
found
the
opening
he
desired
i
should
think
all
this
literary
work
was
rather
a
strain
it
does
make
you
feel
a
bit
muzzy
sometimes
when
you
at
it
from
morning
to
night
is
the
game
worth
the
candle
is
it
worth
it
have
you
made
your
fortune
at
it
not
yet
well
i
gave
you
three
years
keith
smiled
what
did
you
give
me
them
for
to
make
my
fortune
in
to
learn
in
keith
laughed
it
was
enough
for
that
you
should
have
given
me
three
hundred
at
the
very
least
the
laugh
was
discouraging
and
isaac
felt
that
he
was
on
the
wrong
tack
i
give
you
as
many
as
you
like
if
i
could
afford
to
wait
but
i
consider
i
waited
long
enough
already
what
were
you
waiting
for
for
you
to
come
back
keith
face
was
radiant
with
innocent
to
come
back
into
the
business
the
light
of
innocence
died
out
of
the
face
as
suddenly
as
it
had
kindled
my
dear
father
i
shall
never
come
back
i
thought
i
made
that
very
clear
to
you
you
never
made
it
clear
your
behaviour
to
me
not
but
what
i
an
idea
which
perhaps
i
need
not
name
i
never
asked
what
there
was
at
the
bottom
of
that
foolish
business
and
i
never
blamed
you
for
it
if
it
made
you
act
badly
to
me
i
reason
to
believe
it
kept
you
out
of
worse
mischief
keith
felt
a
queer
tightening
at
the
heart
he
understood
that
his
father
was
referring
darkly
to
lucia
harden
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
even
this
remote
and
shadowy
allusion
was
more
than
he
could
bear
he
must
call
him
off
that
trail
and
the
best
way
of
doing
it
was
to
announce
his
engagement
as
you
seem
to
be
rather
mixed
father
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
engaged
to
be
married
have
been
for
the
last
eighteen
months
married
isaac
face
was
tense
with
anxiety
for
he
could
not
tell
what
this
news
meant
for
him
whether
it
would
remove
his
son
farther
from
him
or
bring
him
beyond
all
expectation
near
may
i
ask
who
the
lady
is
any
of
your
fine
friends
in
devonshire
keith
was
silent
with
presentiment
of
the
coming
blow
it
came
i
need
ask
it
that
that
miss
heard
of
her
as
it
happens
it
somebody
you
have
heard
of
you
may
have
seen
her
though
miss
flossie
walker
no
i
never
seen
her
not
to
my
knowledge
how
long
have
you
known
her
ever
since
i
came
here
she
one
of
the
boarders
has
she
any
means
none
isaac
heart
leapt
high
are
you
going
to
congratulate
me
how
can
i
when
i
have
seen
the
lady
you
would
if
you
seen
her
and
when
is
it
to
be
like
most
young
people
you
a
bit
impatient
i
suppose
keith
betrayed
the
extremity
of
his
impatience
by
a
painful
flush
this
subject
of
his
marriage
was
not
to
be
approached
without
a
certain
shame
i
suppose
so
and
like
most
young
people
we
shall
have
to
wait
isaac
eyes
narrowed
and
blinked
in
the
manner
of
a
man
uncertain
of
his
focus
as
it
happened
he
was
just
beginning
to
see
ah
that
what
wearing
you
out
is
it
i
beginning
to
get
a
bit
sick
of
it
i
own
what
she
like
to
look
at
it
this
young
lady
is
she
pretty
very
a
queer
hungry
look
came
over
the
boy
face
isaac
had
seen
that
look
there
once
or
twice
before
his
lips
widened
in
a
rigid
smile
he
had
to
moisten
them
before
they
would
stretch
he
was
profoundly
moved
by
keith
disclosure
by
the
thought
of
that
imperishable
and
untameable
desire
it
held
for
him
the
promise
of
his
own
continuance
it
stirred
in
him
the
strange
fury
of
his
fatherhood
a
fatherhood
destructive
and
malign
that
feeds
on
the
life
of
children
as
he
looked
at
his
son
his
sickly
frame
trembled
before
that
embodiment
of
passion
and
vigour
and
immortal
youth
he
longed
to
possess
himself
of
these
things
of
the
superb
young
intellect
of
the
abounding
life
to
possess
himself
and
live
and
he
would
possess
them
providence
was
on
his
side
providence
had
guided
him
he
could
not
have
chosen
his
moment
better
he
had
come
at
a
crisis
in
keith
life
he
knew
the
boy
nature
after
all
he
would
be
brought
back
to
him
by
hunger
the
invincible
implacable
hunger
of
the
flesh
your
mother
was
pretty
but
she
lost
her
looks
before
i
could
marry
her
i
had
to
wait
for
her
so
i
know
what
you
going
through
but
i
fancy
waiting
comes
harder
on
you
than
it
did
on
me
it
does
said
keith
savagely
every
day
i
think
i
marry
and
risk
it
but
he
added
in
a
gentler
tone
that
might
come
hard
on
her
you
marry
if
you
accept
the
proposal
i
came
to
make
to
you
keith
gave
a
keen
look
at
his
father
he
had
been
touched
by
the
bent
figure
the
wasted
face
the
evident
signs
of
sickness
and
suffering
he
had
resolved
to
be
very
tender
with
him
but
not
even
pity
could
blind
him
to
the
detestable
cunning
of
that
move
it
revolted
him
he
had
not
yet
realized
that
the
old
man
was
fighting
for
his
life
i
not
open
to
any
proposals
he
said
coldly
i
chosen
my
profession
and
i
mean
to
stick
to
it
that
all
very
well
but
you
should
a
solid
standby
over
and
above
literature
does
leave
much
room
for
anything
over
and
above
that
where
you
making
a
mistake
wot
you
want
is
variety
of
occupation
there
no
reason
why
you
should
combine
literature
with
a
more
profitable
business
i
ca
make
it
combine
with
any
business
at
all
well
i
can
understand
your
being
proud
of
your
profession
can
you
understand
my
profession
being
proud
of
me
isaac
smiled
yes
he
could
well
understand
it
and
said
he
i
can
understand
your
objection
to
the
shop
i
have
any
objection
to
the
shop
well
then
there
no
reason
why
we
should
come
to
an
agreement
if
i
do
mind
owning
that
i
ca
get
on
without
your
help
you
might
allow
that
you
get
on
a
bit
better
with
mine
why
you
getting
on
father
well
considering
that
my
business
depended
on
you
entirely
and
that
that
where
the
profits
are
to
be
made
nowadays
that
where
i
i
ca
operate
without
knowledge
and
from
hour
to
hour
i
never
any
seecurity
that
i
not
being
cheated
isaac
would
gladly
have
recalled
that
word
keith
met
it
with
silence
a
silence
more
significant
than
any
speech
charged
as
it
was
with
reminiscence
and
reproof
now
what
i
propose
please
do
propose
anything
i
i
i
ca
do
what
you
want
keith
positively
stammered
in
his
nervous
agitation
wait
till
you
hear
what
i
want
i
not
going
to
ask
you
to
make
catalogues
or
stand
behind
the
counter
or
he
added
almost
humbly
to
do
anything
a
gentleman
does
do
he
looked
round
the
room
the
materials
of
the
furnishing
were
cheap
but
keith
had
appeased
his
sense
of
beauty
in
the
simplicity
of
the
forms
and
the
broad
harmony
of
the
colours
isaac
was
impressed
and
a
little
disheartened
by
the
refinement
of
his
surroundings
a
refinement
that
might
be
fatal
to
his
enterprise
you
shall
your
own
private
room
fitted
up
on
the
first
floor
with
a
writing
table
and
a
swivel
chair
you
come
into
contact
with
customers
at
all
all
i
want
is
to
you
on
the
spot
to
refer
to
i
want
you
to
give
me
the
use
of
those
brains
of
yours
practically
you
be
a
sleeping
partner
but
we
should
profits
from
the
first
thanks
thanks
his
voice
seemed
to
choke
him
it
awfully
good
and
and
generous
of
you
but
i
ca
why
not
i
about
fifteen
reasons
one
enough
i
do
like
the
business
and
i
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
it
you
do
like
the
business
said
isaac
with
the
air
of
considering
an
entirely
new
proposition
no
i
do
like
it
i
am
going
to
raise
the
tone
of
the
business
that
wot
i
want
you
for
to
raise
the
tone
of
the
business
i
should
have
to
raise
the
tone
of
the
british
public
first
well
an
intelligent
bookseller
has
a
good
deal
of
influence
with
customers
and
you
with
your
reputation
there
nothing
you
do
you
could
make
the
business
anything
you
chose
in
a
few
years
we
should
be
at
the
very
head
of
the
trade
i
do
deny
that
the
house
has
been
going
down
there
been
considerable
depression
still
i
should
be
in
a
very
different
position
now
keith
if
you
had
left
me
and
in
the
department
department
there
are
still
enormous
profits
to
be
made
that
precisely
why
i
object
to
my
department
as
you
call
it
i
do
approve
of
those
enormous
profits
now
look
let
have
a
quiet
talk
we
never
have
for
you
were
always
so
violent
if
you
stated
your
objections
to
me
in
a
quiet
reasonable
manner
there
never
have
been
any
misunderstanding
supposing
you
explain
why
you
object
to
those
profits
i
object
because
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
they
got
by
trading
on
another
person
ignorance
of
course
they
are
why
not
if
he
ignorant
it
only
fair
he
should
pay
for
his
ignorance
and
if
i
an
expert
it
fair
i
should
get
an
expert
profits
it
all
a
question
of
buying
and
selling
he
ca
sell
what
he
has
got
and
i
ca
sell
what
i
have
got
supposing
i
got
knowledge
that
he
has
if
i
ca
make
a
profit
out
of
what
can
i
make
a
profit
out
of
i
ca
say
my
own
experience
of
the
business
was
unfortunate
it
struck
me
if
you
remember
that
some
of
your
profits
meant
uncommonly
sharp
practice
talk
of
ignorance
really
for
a
clever
fellow
keith
you
talk
a
deal
of
folly
there
sharp
practice
in
every
trade
in
your
own
trade
if
it
comes
to
that
supposing
you
write
a
silly
book
and
some
of
your
friends
boom
it
high
and
low
and
the
public
buys
it
for
a
work
of
genius
well
are
you
making
a
profit
out
of
other
ignorance
of
course
you
are
i
have
made
profit
that
way
yet
because
you
well
i
perfectly
willing
to
believe
your
objections
are
conscientious
but
look
at
it
another
way
i
a
man
unconsciously
he
caressed
his
soft
hat
the
hat
of
a
methodist
parson
as
he
spoke
is
it
likely
i
continue
in
any
business
i
could
reconcile
to
my
conscience
i
no
doubt
you
reconciled
it
to
your
conscience
that
hardly
a
reason
why
i
should
reconcile
it
to
mine
that
means
that
you
let
me
be
ruined
for
want
of
a
little
advice
which
i
paid
you
well
for
if
my
advice
is
all
you
want
you
can
have
it
any
day
for
nothing
wot
you
get
for
nothing
is
worth
just
about
wot
you
get
it
for
no
mine
was
a
fair
business
proposal
and
either
you
come
into
it
or
you
stay
out
most
decidedly
i
prefer
to
stay
out
then
said
isaac
suddenly
i
shall
have
to
give
up
the
shop
i
most
awfully
sorry
there
no
good
your
being
sorry
if
you
wo
help
me
i
would
help
you
if
i
could
if
you
could
he
paused
prudence
plucked
him
by
the
sleeve
whispering
that
never
while
he
lived
must
he
breathe
the
word
insolvency
but
a
wilder
instinct
urged
him
to
disclosure
why
it
rests
with
you
to
keep
me
out
of
the
bankruptcy
court
keith
said
nothing
he
had
held
out
against
the
appeal
to
his
appetites
it
was
harder
to
withstand
this
call
on
his
finer
feelings
but
if
the
immediate
effect
of
the
news
was
to
shock
and
distress
him
the
next
instant
he
was
struggling
with
a
shameful
reflection
for
all
his
shame
it
was
impossible
not
to
suspect
his
father
of
some
deeper
more
complicated
ruse
isaac
sat
very
still
turning
on
his
son
a
look
of
concentrated
resentment
keith
youth
was
hateful
to
him
now
it
withheld
pitilessly
implacably
the
life
that
it
was
in
its
hands
to
give
meanwhile
keith
wrestled
with
his
suspicion
and
overcame
it

father
i
do
what
i
can
i
come
round
and
look
into
things
for
you
if
that
any
good
the
instant
he
had
made
the
offer
he
was
aware
of
its
futility
it
was
not
for
his
business
capacity
that
he
was
valued
and
he
never
had
been
permitted
to
interfere
with
the
finances
of
the
shop
the
suggestion
roused
his
father
to
a
passion
that
partook
of
terror
look
into
things
he
rose
trembling
you
mind
your
own
business
i
can
look
into
things
myself
there
been
no
need
to
look
into
them
at
all
if
you
robbed
and
deceived
me
robbed
and
deceived
me
i
said
you
took
your
education
which
gave
to
put
into
business
you
took
it
out
of
the
business
and
set
up
with
it
on
your
own
account
and
i
tell
you
you
might
as
well
made
off
with
a
few
thousands
out
of
my
till
robbing
wot
been
guilty
of
in
the
sight
of
god
and
you
can
come
and
talk
to
me
about
your
conscience
i
do
understand
your
kind
of
conscience
keith
there
was
still
a
touch
of
appeal
in
his
utterance
of
his
son
name
perhaps
not
said
keith
sorrowfully
i
do
understand
it
myself
he
walked
with
his
father
to
holborn
silently
through
the
drizzling
rain
he
held
an
umbrella
over
him
while
they
waited
still
silently
for
the
liverpool
street
omnibus
he
noticed
with
some
anxiety
that
the
old
man
walked
queerly
shuffling
and
trailing
his
left
foot
that
he
had
difficulty
in
mounting
the
step
of
the
omnibus
and
was
got
into
his
seat
only
after
much
heaving
and
harrying
on
the
part
of
the
conductor
his
face
and
attitude
as
he
sank
crouching
into
his
seat
were
those
of
a
man
returning
from
the
funeral
of
his
last
hope
and
in
keith
heart
there
was
sorrow
too
as
for
something
dead
and
departed

as
are
so
many
feminine
attachments
upon
fantasy
or
caprice
but
rested
securely
on
the
enduring
commonplace
if
flossie
respected
ada
because
of
her
knowledge
of
dress
and
her
remarkable
insight
into
the
ways
of
gentlemen
ada
admired
flossie
because
of
the
engagement
which
after
all
was
not
like
some
girls
engagements
an
airy
possibility
or
a
fiction
but
an
accomplished
fact
this
attachment
together
with
the
firm
possession
of
keith
helped
to
tide
flossie
over
the
tedium
of
waiting
only
one
thing
was
wanting
to
complete
her
happiness
and
even
that
the
thoughtful
gods
provided
about
six
one
evening
as
rickman
was
going
out
of
the
house
he
was
thrust
violently
back
into
the
passage
by
some
one
coming
in
it
was
young
spinks
and
the
luggage
that
he
carried
in
his
hand
gave
a
frightful
impetus
to
his
entry
at
the
sight
of
rickman
he
let
go
a
an
umbrella
and
a
portmanteau
and
laid
hold
of
him
by
both
hands
razors
what
luck
i
say
i
gone
and
done
it
chucked
them
hooked
it
stood
it
eighteen
months
could
stand
it
any
longer
on
my
soul
i
could
but
it
all
right
i
explain
explain
what
to
whom
you
lunatic
sh
sh
sh
to
you
for
heaven
syke
do
talk
so
loud
hear
you
you
have
got
a
train
you
want
to
catch
or
an
appointment
have
you
i
have
got
a
train
but
i
have
got
an
appointment
you
might
spare
a
fellow
five
minutes
ten
minutes
ca
you
i
sha
keep
you
more
than
ten
at
the
outside
there
something
i
must
tell
you
but
i
ca
do
it
here
and
as
rickman
opened
the
door
spinks
drew
back
with
a
gesture
of
abhorrence
he
then
made
a
dash
for
the
adjoining
room
but
retired
precipitately
backwards
oh
damn
that
somebody
bedroom
now
how
could
tell
look
here
if
you
going
to
make
an
ass
of
yourself
you
better
come
up
to
my
room
and
do
it
quietly
thanks
i
got
a
room
somewhere
but
i
do
know
which
it
is
yet
rickman
could
only
think
that
the
youth
had
broken
his
habit
of
sobriety
he
closed
the
study
door
discreetly
lit
the
lamp
and
took
a
good
look
at
him
he
fancied
he
caught
a
suggestion
of
melancholy
in
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
the
lines
of
his
high
angular
nose
but
there
was
no
sign
of
intoxication
in
sidney
clear
grey
eye
nor
trace
of
wasting
emotion
in
his
smooth
shaven
cheek
under
the
searching
he
looked
almost
as
fresh
as
pink
as
callow
as
he
had
done
four
years
ago
he
dropped
helplessly
into
a
low
chair
rickman
took
a
seat
opposite
him
and
waited
while
not
under
the
direct
stimulus
of
nervous
excitement
young
spinks
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
utterance
at
last
he
spoke
i
say
you
must
think
i
acted
in
a
very
queer
way
queer
is
the
word
for
it
it
astounding
really
think
so
you
mean
i
any
rights
it
it
fair
to
you
to
come
back
as
i
done
well
i
do
know
about
its
being
very
fair
it
certainly
very
safe
safe
safe
ah
i
was
afraid
you
think
that
wo
you
let
me
explain
certainly
i
should
like
to
know
your
reasons
for
running
into
me
like
a
giddy
locomotive
well
but
i
ca
explain
anything
if
you
go
on
rotting
like
that
all
right
only
look
sharp
i
got
to
meet
a
fellow
in
baker
street
at
seven
if
you
get
under
weigh
we
might
finish
off
the
explanation
outside
if
you
going
back
that
way
going
back
oh
lord
do
you
know
that
i
come
back
here
to
stay
i
got
a
room
oh
that
the
explanation
is
it
no
that
the
thing
i
got
to
explain
i
thought
you
think
acted
dishonourably
in
in
following
her
like
this
but
i
stand
it
over
there
without
her
i
tried
but
on
my
soul
i
could
i
shall
be
all
right
if
i
can
only
see
her
sometimes
at
meals
and
and
so
forth
i
sha
say
a
word
i
have
said
a
word
i
do
even
think
she
knows
and
if
she
did
so
it
perfectly
safe
you
know
rickman
it
perfectly
safe
who
does
know
what
and
if
who
did
roared
rickman
overcome
with
laughter
sh
sh
sh
flossie
i
mean
m
miss
walker
rickman
stopped
laughing
and
looked
at
young
spinks
with
something
like
compassion
i
say
old
chap
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
i
should
have
gone
off
my
chump
if
i
hung
on
at
that
place
i
could
get
her
out
of
my
mind
not
even
in
the
shop
i
used
to
lie
awake
at
nights
thinking
of
her
and
then
you
know
i
could
eat
in
fact
you
were
pretty
bad
were
you
oh
well
i
just
chucked
it
up
and
came
here
it
all
right
razors
you
need
mind
i
never
had
a
chance
with
her
she
never
gave
me
so
much
as
a
thought
not
a
thought
it
the
queerest
thing
i
tell
you
how
i
got
into
this
state
i
do
know
myself
only
now
she
engaged
and
so
forth
you
might
think
that
well
you
might
think
young
spinks
had
evidently
come
to
the
most
delicate
and
complicated
part
of
his
explanation
well
that
i
no
right
to
go
on
getting
into
states
but
when
it
does
make
any
difference
to
her
and
it
ca
matter
to
you
he
paused
but
rickman
gathered
that
what
he
wished
to
plead
was
that
in
those
circumstances
he
was
clearly
welcome
to
his
state
i
mean
that
if
it
all
up
with
me
you
know
it
all
right
i
mean
it
safe
enough
for
you
poor
spinks
became
lost
in
the
maze
of
his
own
beautiful
sentiments
adoration
for
rickman
himself
the
soul
of
honour
struggled
blindly
with
his
passion
for
flossie
walker
but
the
thought
which
his
brain
had
formed
which
his
tongue
refused
to
utter
was
that
the
hopelessness
of
his
passion
made
it
no
disloyalty
to
his
friend
it
can
make
no
difference
to
her
my
being
here
he
said
simply
nonsense
you
as
much
right
to
be
here
as
i
have
yes
but
under
the
circumstances
it
might
have
been
perfectly
fair
to
you
see
my
dear
spinky
it
perfectly
fair
to
me
but
is
it
you
wo
mind
me
suggesting
it
is
it
perfectly
fair
to
yourself
spinks
sat
silent
for
a
minute
laying
his
hand
upon
the
place
of
thought
as
if
trying
to
take
that
idea
in
yes
he
said
deliberately
that
all
right
in
fact
nothing
else
will
do
my
business
it
sounds
queer
but
that
the
only
way
to
get
her
out
of
my
head
you
see
when
i
see
her
i
do
think
about
her
but
when
i
do
see
her
i
ca
think
of
anything
else
rickman
was
interested
it
struck
him
that
latterly
he
had
been
affected
in
precisely
the
opposite
way
it
was
curious
to
compare
young
sidney
sensations
with
his
own
he
forgot
all
about
the
man
in
baker
street
i
do
mean
to
say
i
shall
ever
get
over
it
when
a
man
goes
through
this
sort
of
business
it
leaves
its
mark
on
him
somewhere
and
indeed
it
seemed
to
have
stamped
an
expression
of
permanent
foolishness
on
spinks
comely
face
rickman
smiled
even
while
he
sympathized
yes
i
daresay
i
sorry
old
man
but
if
i
were
you
i
would
be
too
down
in
the
mouth
not
worth
it
i
mean
after
all
there
are
other
things
besides
women
in
the
world
it
would
be
a
bad
place
even
if
there
were
any
women
in
it
life
is
good
said
the
engaged
man
you
had
better
dress
for
dinner
he
could
give
no
richer
consolation
without
seeming
to
depreciate
the
unique
value
of
flossie
as
for
spinks
present
determination
he
thought
it
decidedly
risky
for
spinks
but
if
spinks
enjoyed
balancing
himself
in
this
way
on
the
edge
of
perdition
it
was
no
business
of
his
as
it
happened
the
event
seemed
to
prove
that
spinks
knew
very
well
what
he
was
about
the
callow
youth
had
evidently
hit
on
the
right
treatment
for
his
own
disease
in
one
point
however
his
modesty
had
deceived
him
his
presence
was
far
from
being
a
matter
of
indifference
to
flossie
a
rejected
lover
is
useful
in
so
many
ways
it
may
be
a
triumph
to
make
one
man
supremely
happy
but
the
effect
is
considerably
heightened
if
you
have
at
the
same
time
made
another
man
supremely
wretched
flossie
found
that
the
spectacle
of
young
dejection
restored
all
its
first
fresh
piquancy
to
her
engagement
at
tavistock
place
he
more
than
justified
his
existence
true
he
did
not
remain
depressed
for
very
long
and
there
was
something
not
altogether
flattering
in
the
high
rebound
of
his
elastic
youth
but
as
miss
bishop
was
careful
to
point
out
his
joyous
presence
would
have
a
most
salutary
effect
in
disturbing
that
prosaic
sense
of
security
in
which
gentlemen
affections
have
been
known
to
sleep
but
spinks
was
destined
to
serve
the
object
of
his
infatuation
in
yet
another
way
it
was
in
the
second
spring
after
rickman
engagement
flossie
and
ada
were
in
the
one
half
hour
before
dinner
putting
their
heads
together
over
a
new
should
wonder
said
miss
bishop
if
you
saw
me
coming
out
in
one
of
these
gloriana
coats
this
spring
i
shall
get
a
fawn
fawn
my
colour
i
must
say
i
love
blue
i
think
i
almost
mad
about
blue
any
shade
of
blue
i
do
care
what
it
is
i
know
i
ca
go
wrong
about
a
colour
but
then
there
the
style
flossie
fingers
turned
over
the
pages
with
soft
lingering
touches
while
her
face
expressed
the
gravest
hesitation
keith
likes
me
best
in
these
stiff
things
but
i
ca
bear
them
i
like
more
of
a
fancy
style
i
see
you
do
said
miss
bishop
solemnly
yes
that
because
she
a
bit
of
a
fancy
article
herself
murmured
a
voice
from
the
back
where
spinks
had
concealed
himself
behind
a
curtain
and
now
listened
with
a
voluptuous
sense
of
unlawful
initiation
i
sy
we
shall
have
to
stop
if
he
keep
on
listening
that
wy
do
stop
please
miss
ada
there
i
got
my
fingers
in
my
ears
on
my
honour
i
have
you
can
talk
as
many
secrets
as
you
like
now
i
ca
hear
a
word
the
two
girls
dropped
their
voices
to
a
low
impassioned
monotone
you
got
to
dress
for
somebody
else
besides
yourself
now
an
engaged
young
lady
oh
i
do
know
that
he
takes
so
much
notice
but
he
given
me
lots
of
things
besides
my
ring
i
to
have
a
real
silver
belt
a
russian
next
birthday
i
sy
he
good
to
you
you
know
some
gentlemen
get
so
careless
once
they
sure
of
you
know
we
all
think
you
acted
so
honourable
giving
out
your
engagement
as
soon
as
it
was
on
when
do
you
think
you
be
married
i
ca
say
i
do
know
yet
never
i
think
as
long
as
i
in
that
old
bank
even
with
his
fingers
in
his
ears
young
sidney
heard
that
voice
and
before
he
could
stop
himself
he
was
listening
again
do
you
like
it
said
miss
bishop
no
i
hate
it
spinks
gave
a
cough
and
miss
bishop
began
reading
to
herself
in
ostentatious
silence
till
the
provocations
of
the
page
grew
irresistible
look
here
floss
she
said
excitedly
look
at
will
be
the
colour
this
year
and
for
morning
wear
a
plain
costume
in
palest
fawn
is
for
who
can
stand
it
most
undeniably
hitherto
miss
bishop
had
avoided
that
word
which
she
pronounced
chick
whenever
she
met
it
but
now
in
its
thrilling
connection
with
the
costume
it
was
brought
home
to
her
in
a
peculiarly
personal
manner
and
she
pondered
i
wish
i
knew
what
that
word
meant
it
always
coming
up
in
my
magazine
i
think
said
flossie
it
means
something
like
smart
stylish
you
know
young
sidney
leapt
suddenly
from
his
seat
go
it
flossie
give
us
the
french
for
a
nice
little
cup
er
tea
really
it
too
bad
we
ca
have
a
plyce
to
ourselves
where
we
can
talk
i
going
and
as
miss
bishop
went
she
still
pondered
rendering
of
the
word
little
did
any
of
them
know
what
grave
issues
were
to
hang
on
it
then
spinks
emerged
from
his
miss
walker
he
said
he
considered
it
more
honourable
to
call
her
miss
walker
now
whenever
he
could
think
of
it
only
he
could
always
think
i
did
know
you
knew
the
french
language
and
why
should
i
know
it
as
well
as
other
people
i
expect
you
know
it
a
jolly
sight
better
do
you
think
now
you
could
read
and
write
it
easily
i
might
said
flossie
guardedly
if
i
had
a
little
practice
because
if
you
could
you
say
your
tired
of
the
bank
i
should
think
i
tired
of
it
well
flossie
do
you
know
a
good
typewriter
girl
who
can
read
and
write
french
can
get
twice
as
much
as
you
getting
how
do
you
know
girl
i
know
told
me
so
she
corresponding
clerk
for
a
big
firm
of
wine
merchants
in
the
city
she
going
to
be
married
this
autumn
and
if
you
looked
sharp
you
might
get
her
berth
in
a
shop
rickman
would
hear
of
it
it
is
a
shop
you
know
it
an
office
you
ask
him
flossie
did
not
ask
him
she
knew
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
but
not
very
long
after
spinks
had
made
his
suggestion
finding
keith
very
snug
in
his
study
one
evening
reading
anatole
france
to
his
immense
delight
she
whispered
into
his
ear
a
little
shy
request
that
some
day
when
he
was
busy
he
would
help
her
a
bit
with
her
french
the
lessons
were
arranged
for
then
and
there
at
so
many
kisses
an
hour
payable
by
quarterly
instalments
if
desired
and
for
several
evenings
sitting
very
close
together
as
persons
must
sit
who
are
looking
over
the
same
book
they
read
translating
turn
by
turn
the
delicious
de
mon
until
flossie
interest
was
exhausted
come
i
not
going
on
with
any
more
of
that
stuff
so
you
think
it
i
no
time
to
waste
if
you
have
and
i
have
come
across
one
word
in
that
book
yet
that
be
any
use
to
me
what
a
utilitarian
beaver
he
lay
back
in
his
chair
laughing
at
her
as
he
might
have
laughed
at
the
fascinating
folly
of
a
child
i
tell
you
what
it
is
savage
i
get
another
french
master
if
you
do
look
out
some
one
who
teach
me
the
way
i
want
to
learn
i
teach
you
any
way
you
like
floss
on
any
system
if
you
only
explain
what
you
want
what
your
idea
my
idea
this
how
would
it
be
if
you
and
me
were
to
write
french
letters
to
each
other
rather
the
beaver
intelligence
is
going
to
its
head
that
the
way
to
learn
floss
you
get
over
the
ground
like
winking
but
you
know
i
shall
have
to
raise
my
terms
all
right
we
see
about
that
he
was
delighted
with
her
idea
that
flossie
should
have
an
idea
at
all
was
something
so
deliciously
new
and
surprising
and
what
could
be
more
heartrending
than
these
prodigious
intellectual
efforts
her
evident
fear
that
her
limitations
constituted
a
barrier
between
them
as
if
it
mattered
as
if
he
wanted
a
literary
critic
for
his
wife
and
how
brutally
he
had
criticized
as
if
it
mattered
still
in
spite
of
his
compunction
the
french
lessons
were
not
altogether
a
success
there
was
too
much
disagreement
and
discussion
about
terms
for
the
master
became
more
and
more
exorbitant
in
his
charges
as
the
days
went
on
and
the
pupil
still
complained
that
she
was
learning
nothing
she
was
thoroughly
dissatisfied
with
his
method
he
would
break
off
at
the
most
interesting
the
most
instructive
point
and
let
loose
his
imagination
in
all
sorts
of
ridiculous
histories
that
followed
from
the
idea
of
her
being
a
beaver
and
when
she
desired
him
to
tell
her
such
simple
things
as
the
french
for
your
esteemed
favour
to
hand
cheque
enclosed
we
have
forwarded
to
you
as
per
invoice
he
wanted
to
know
what
on
earth
a
beaver
had
to
do
with
invoices
it
was
spinks
who
explained
the
nature
of
the
connection
poor
spinks
who
had
made
the
suggestion
with
an
almost
suicidally
honourable
intention
was
to
his
immense
astonishment
merely
sworn
at
for
his
interference
and
when
flossie
brought
keith
his
tea
that
evening
she
found
him
in
a
most
ungentlemanly
humour
she
waited
demurely
for
a
pause
in
the
storm
that
raged
round
spinks
and
his
confounded
she
cast
a
significant
glance
at
the
table
strewn
at
that
moment
with
the
rough
draft
of
rickman
tragedy
flossie
could
understand
why
he
could
never
write
a
thing
out
clearly
from
the
first
nor
why
she
should
write
it
for
him
at
his
dictation
it
all
very
well
keith
said
she
but
if
ca
do
more
must
before
she
left
the
room
it
was
understood
between
them
that
flossie
would
renounce
her
and
that
they
would
be
married
if
possible
some
time
in
the
autumn
he
felt
curiously
shaken
by
that
interview
he
spent
the
evening
reading
over
what
he
had
written
vainly
trying
to
recall
his
inspiration
to
kindle
himself
anew
at
his
own
flame
last
night
he
had
had
more
inspiration
than
he
could
do
with
his
ideas
had
come
upon
him
with
a
rush
in
a
singing
torrent
of
light
his
mind
had
been
then
almost
intolerably
luminous
now
there
was
twilight
on
its
high
parts
and
darkness
over
the
face
of
its
deep
his
ideas
arrested
in
had
been
flung
down
into
the
deep
and
from
the
farther
shore
he
caught
as
it
were
the
flutter
of
a
gown
and
the
light
laughter
of
a
fugitive
muse
chapter
l
one
day
four
years
after
the
publication
of
rickman
received
a
letter
in
an
unknown
hand
a
woman
hand
but
with
a
familiar
vivid
signature
the
signature
that
is
to
be
seen
beneath
the
portraits
of
walter
fielding
the
greatest
among
contemporary
poets
the
living
god
of
rickman
idolatry
dear
sir
he
wrote
or
rather
some
woman
had
written
for
him
i
came
across
your
poems
the
other
day
by
chance
i
must
confess
and
not
by
choice
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
about
them
and
i
would
therefore
be
glad
if
you
could
call
on
me
here
i
say
call
on
me
for
i
am
an
old
man
and
you
if
i
am
not
mistaken
are
a
young
one
and
i
say
because
the
day
after
i
may
not
have
that
desire
to
see
you
which
i
feel
faithfully
yours
walter
fielding
you
had
better
come
in
time
for
lunch
at
one
rickman
hand
trembled
as
he
answered
that
letter
all
evening
he
said
to
himself
i
shall
see
fielding
and
the
beating
of
his
heart
kept
him
awake
until
the
dawn
of
the
wonderful
day
and
as
he
dressed
he
said
to
himself
i
shall
see
fielding
that
he
should
see
him
was
enough
he
could
hardly
bear
to
think
what
fielding
had
to
say
to
him
he
had
risen
early
so
as
to
go
down
into
surrey
on
his
bicycle
about
noon
he
struck
into
the
long
golden
road
that
goes
straight
across
the
high
moor
where
the
great
poet
had
built
him
a
house
inside
his
gates
a
fork
of
the
road
sloped
to
the
shore
of
a
large
lake
fringed
with
the
crimson
heather
the
house
stood
far
back
on
a
flat
stretch
of
moor
that
looked
as
if
it
had
been
cut
with
one
sweep
of
a
gigantic
scythe
from
the
sheltering
he
saw
fielding
far
off
standing
at
the
door
of
his
house
to
welcome
him
fielding
was
and
he
looked
sixty
a
strong
straight
figure
not
over
tall
nor
over
slender
wearing
sanely
but
loosely
the
ordinary
dress
of
an
english
gentleman
a
head
with
strong
straight
features
masses
of
white
hair
that
hid
the
summit
of
the
forehead
a
curling
moustache
and
beard
showing
the
line
of
the
mouth
still
red
as
in
his
youth
a
head
to
be
carved
in
silver
or
bronze
its
edges
bitten
by
time
like
the
edges
of
an
antique
bust
or
coin
so
you
come
have
you
was
his
greeting
which
the
grasp
of
his
hand
made
friendly
he
took
rickman
straight
into
his
study
where
a
lady
sat
writing
at
a
table
in
the
window
first
of
all
said
he
i
must
introduce
you
to
miss
gurney
who
introduced
you
to
me
miss
gurney
rose
and
held
out
a
slender
feverish
hand
she
did
not
smile
her
face
narrowed
so
abruptly
below
her
cheekbones
that
there
was
hardly
room
for
a
smile
on
it
but
her
eyes
under
their
thick
black
brows
turned
on
him
an
eager
gaze
her
eyes
he
thought
were
too
piercing
to
be
altogether
friendly
he
wondered
whether
it
was
the
flame
in
them
that
had
consumed
her
face
and
made
it
so
white
and
small
she
made
a
few
unremarkable
remarks
and
turned
again
to
her
writing
table
yes
gertrude
you
may
go
her
sallow
nervous
hands
had
already
begun
gathering
up
her
work
in
preparation
for
the
word
that
banished
her
when
it
came
she
smiled
by
some
miracle
and
went
they
had
a
little
while
to
wait
before
luncheon
the
poet
offered
whisky
and
soda
and
could
hardly
conceal
his
surprise
when
it
was
refused
you
must
forgive
me
he
said
presently
for
never
having
heard
of
you
till
yesterday
my
secretary
keeps
these
things
from
me
as
a
rule
this
time
she
allowed
herself
to
be
corrupted
rickman
felt
a
sudden
interest
in
miss
gurney
your
poems
were
sent
to
her
by
a
friend
of
hers
with
the
request
a
most
improper
one
that
i
should
read
them
i
had
no
intention
of
reading
them
but
i
was
pleased
with
the
volume
at
first
sight
it
was
exactly
the
right
length
the
right
length
yes
small
octavo
the
very
best
length
for
making
cigar
lighters
rickman
had
heard
of
the
sardonic
the
cruel
humour
with
which
fielding
scathed
his
contemporaries
still
he
could
hardly
have
expected
even
him
to
deal
such
a
violent
and
devilish
blow
though
he
flushed
with
the
smart
he
bore
himself
bravely
under
it
after
all
it
was
to
see
fielding
that
he
had
come
i
am
proud
said
he
to
have
served
so
luminous
a
purpose
his
readiness
seemed
to
have
disarmed
the
formidable
fielding
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
the
young
man
a
moment
or
two
without
speaking
then
the
demon
stirred
in
him
again
with
a
malignant
twinkle
of
his
keen
eyes
you
see
i
was
determined
to
treat
you
honourably
as
you
came
to
me
through
a
friend
of
miss
gurney
but
for
her
you
would
have
gone
where
your
contemporaries
go
into
the
basket
they
serve
no
purpose
luminous
or
otherwise
he
chuckled
ominously
i
had
the
knife
ready
for
you
but
if
you
want
to
know
why
i
paused
in
the
deed
of
destruction
it
was
because
i
was
fascinated
positively
fascinated
by
the
abominations
of
your
illustrator
and
so
before
i
knew
what
i
was
doing
or
i
assure
you
i
would
never
have
done
it
i
had
read
actually
read
the
lines
which
the
creature
quotes
at
the
bottom
of
his
foul
frontispiece
why
he
quoted
them
i
do
not
know
they
have
no
more
to
do
with
his
obscenities
than
i
have
and
then
i
read
the
poem
they
were
taken
from
he
paused
his
pauses
were
deadly
you
have
one
great
merit
in
my
eyes
rickman
looked
up
with
a
courageous
smile
prepared
for
another
pleasantry
more
murderous
than
the
last
you
have
not
imitated
me
for
one
horrible
moment
rickman
was
inspired
to
turn
some
phrase
about
the
hopelessness
of
imitating
the
inimitable
he
thought
better
of
it
but
not
before
the
old
man
divined
his
flattering
intention
he
shook
himself
savagely
in
his
chair
do
please
do
say
what
you
were
going
to
say
if
you
knew
how
i
loathe
my
imitators
i
should
have
sent
for
you
if
you
had
been
one
of
them
his
mind
seemed
to
be
diverted
from
his
present
victim
by
some
voluptuous
and
iniquitous
reminiscence
then
he
began
again
but
you
and
your
ah
he
leant
forward
suddenly
as
he
gave
out
the
interjection
like
a
growl
do
you
know
you
a
very
terrible
young
man
what
do
you
mean
by
setting
my
old
cracked
heart
dancing
to
those
detestable
tunes
i
wish
i
never
read
the
d
d
things
he
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
no
no
you
have
learnt
any
of
those
tunes
from
me
my
muse
wears
a
straighter
and
a
longer
petticoat
and
i
flatter
myself
she
has
the
manners
of
an
english
gentlewoman
rickman
blushed
painfully
this
time
he
had
no
reply
to
make
to
that
i
did
mean
fielding
went
on
to
talk
to
you
about
your
but
harcombe
and
song
of
those
are
great
poems
rickman
looked
up
startled
out
of
his
by
the
unexpected
words
and
the
sudden
curious
vibration
in
the
voice
that
uttered
them
yet
he
could
hardly
realize
that
fielding
was
praising
him
they
moved
me
said
fielding
as
nothing
moves
me
now
except
the
psalms
of
david
i
have
been
a
great
poet
as
poets
go
nowadays
but
he
smiled
radiantly
the
painful
conviction
is
forced
upon
me
that
you
will
be
a
greater
if
you
live
i
wanted
to
tell
you
this
because
nobody
else
is
likely
to
find
it
out
until
you
you
may
make
up
your
mind
to
that
my
friend
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
many
things
but
they
do
matter
now
fielding
ignored
the
compliment
any
one
found
it
out
except
yourself
only
one
person
man
or
woman
he
thought
of
maddox
that
irresponsible
person
a
man
and
perhaps
he
hardly
counts
the
old
poet
gave
him
a
keen
glance
from
his
eyes
there
one
other
person
who
apparently
does
count
either
well
i
think
that
was
the
on
their
way
to
the
he
remarked
that
another
reason
why
i
sent
for
you
because
i
hear
they
not
been
particularly
kind
to
you
do
suppose
i
going
to
pity
you
for
that
i
do
pity
myself
sir
no
no
you
do
that
what
i
like
about
you
he
added
taking
his
guest
by
the
arm
and
steering
him
to
his
place
at
luncheon
miss
gurney
took
a
prominent
part
in
the
conversation
which
rickman
for
her
sake
endeavoured
to
divert
from
the
enthralling
subject
of
himself
but
his
host
perceiving
with
evident
amusement
his
modest
intention
brought
it
up
again
do
imagine
for
a
moment
said
he
that
miss
gurney
admires
you
she
hates
young
poets
miss
gurney
smiled
but
as
rickman
saw
more
in
assent
than
polite
denial
throughout
the
meal
she
had
the
air
of
merely
tolerating
his
presence
there
because
it
humoured
the
great
man
eccentricity
from
time
to
time
she
looked
at
him
with
an
interest
in
which
he
detected
a
certain
fear
the
fear
he
gathered
was
lest
his
coming
should
disturb
or
in
any
way
do
harm
to
the
object
of
her
flagrant
adoration
after
she
had
left
the
table
fielding
reproached
him
for
mixing
water
with
his
wine
in
one
way
said
he
you
a
disappointment
i
should
have
preferred
to
see
you
drink
your
wine
like
a
man
unfortunately
said
rickman
it
not
so
easy
to
drink
it
like
a
man
if
you
ever
drunk
it
like
a
beast
you
an
even
more
remarkable
person
than
i
thought
you
were
said
the
poet
rising
abruptly
from
the
table
he
proposed
that
they
should
take
a
walk
in
the
garden
or
rather
on
the
moor
for
the
heather
ran
crimson
to
the
poet
doors
and
the
young
pines
stood
sentinel
at
his
windows
they
walked
slowly
towards
the
lake
on
their
way
there
fielding
stopped
and
drew
a
deep
breath
filling
his
lungs
with
the
pure
sweet
air
ah
that
better
he
looked
round
him
after
all
we
right
rickman
it
the
poets
that
shall
judge
the
world
and
if
say
it
beautiful
it
beautiful
good
happy
fielding
thought
rickman
fielding
had
never
suffered
as
he
had
suffered
dream
had
never
been
divorced
from
reality
it
seemed
fitting
to
the
younger
poet
that
his
god
should
inhabit
these
pure
and
lofty
spaces
should
walk
thus
on
golden
roads
through
a
land
of
crimson
in
an
atmosphere
of
crystal
calm
he
would
have
liked
to
talk
to
fielding
of
fielding
but
his
awe
restrained
him
fielding
mind
did
not
wander
long
from
his
companion
let
me
see
said
he
do
you
follow
any
trade
or
profession
he
added
with
a
smile
besides
your
own
i
a
journalist
rickman
mentioned
his
connection
with
and
ah
i
knew
there
was
an
unlucky
star
somewhere
well
at
any
rate
you
wo
have
to
turn
your
muse
on
to
the
streets
to
get
your
living
but
a
trade
better
than
a
profession
and
a
craft
better
than
a
trade
it
does
monopolize
the
higher
centres
i
certainly
had
the
impression
that
you
had
been
in
trade
rickman
wondered
who
could
have
given
it
to
him
miss
gurney
friend
he
supposed
but
who
was
miss
gurney
friend
a
hope
came
to
him
that
made
his
heart
stand
still
but
he
answered
calmly
i
was
i
worked
for
two
years
in
a
bookshop
as
a
bibliographical
expert
and
before
that
i
stood
behind
the
counter
most
of
my
time
why
did
you
leave
it
you
were
ashamed
of
your
trade
not
of
my
trade
but
of
the
way
i
had
to
follow
it
i
not
ashamed
of
working
for
horace
jewdwine
he
brought
the
name
in
awkwardly
in
bringing
it
in
at
all
he
had
some
vague
hope
that
it
might
lead
fielding
to
disclose
the
identity
of
the
friend
horace
jewdwine
was
a
link
if
his
name
were
familiar
to
fielding
there
would
be
no
proof
perhaps
but
a
very
strong
presumption
that
what
he
hoped
was
true
he
is
a
friend
of
yours
yes
his
hope
leapt
high
but
fielding
dashed
it
to
the
ground
i
never
heard
of
him
i
see
he
said
you
got
a
conscience
have
you
also
got
a
wife
not
yet
but
good
so
young
a
man
as
you
can
not
afford
to
keep
i
am
so
old
that
i
may
be
pardoned
if
i
give
you
some
advice
but
why
should
i
you
wo
take
it
i
should
like
to
hear
it
all
the
same
sir
well
well
it
cheap
enough
whatever
you
do
do
fritter
yourself
away
upon
the
sort
of
women
it
may
be
your
misfortune
to
have
met
it
was
beautifully
done
this
first
intimation
of
his
consciousness
of
any
difference
between
them
between
rickman
who
had
glorified
a
variety
actress
and
walter
fielding
whose
muse
had
always
had
the
manners
of
an
english
gentlewoman
and
to
rickman
heart
amid
vivid
images
of
poppies
and
flossies
the
memory
of
lucia
harden
stirred
like
a
dividing
sword
that
is
my
advice
said
fielding
but
you
will
not
take
it
these
things
said
rickman
are
not
always
in
our
power
in
the
silence
which
followed
he
put
the
question
that
was
burning
in
him
may
i
ask
who
the
friend
was
who
told
miss
gurney
about
me
you
may
ask
miss
gurney
but
i
do
not
think
she
tell
you
it
seems
to
be
a
secret
and
miss
gurney
strange
to
say
is
a
young
woman
who
can
keep
a
secret
he
led
the
way
to
a
seat
overlooking
the
lake
where
they
sat
for
awhile
in
silence
and
rickman
found
his
thoughts
roaming
from
his
god
presently
fielding
rose
and
turned
back
to
the
house
rickman
felt
that
the
slow
footsteps
were
measuring
now
the
moments
that
he
had
to
be
with
him
he
was
glad
that
they
were
slow
fielding
stopped
at
his
and
stood
for
a
second
gazing
earnestly
at
the
young
man
when
you
write
anything
he
said
you
may
always
send
it
to
me
but
no
more
please
no
more
there
wo
be
any
more
good
i
do
not
ask
you
to
come
again
to
see
me
rickman
struggled
for
an
answer
but
could
not
think
of
anything
better
than
it
enough
for
me
to
have
seen
you
once
which
was
not
at
all
what
he
had
meant
to
say
fielding
smiled
faintly
his
humour
pleased
rickman
fancied
with
the
ambiguity
of
his
shy
speech
i
afraid
i
tired
you
sir
he
said
impulsively
you
have
not
tired
me
i
tire
myself
but
here
is
miss
gurney
she
will
look
after
you
and
give
you
tea
geniality
he
continued
is
not
my
strong
point
as
you
may
have
perceived
and
any
unnatural
effort
of
the
kind
fatigues
me
my
own
fault
you
have
been
very
generous
to
me
generous
there
ca
be
any
generosity
between
equals
only
a
simple
act
of
justice
it
is
you
who
have
been
good
to
me
i
to
you
yes
you
have
satisfied
my
curiosity
i
own
that
sometimes
i
have
wanted
to
know
what
sort
of
voice
will
be
singing
after
i
am
dead
and
now
i
know
and
thank
you
he
pressed
his
hand
turned
abruptly
and
shuffled
into
the
house
he
was
noticeably
the
worse
for
his
walk
and
rickman
felt
that
he
had
to
answer
for
it
to
miss
gurney
i
afraid
i
tired
him
i
hope
i
have
done
him
harm
miss
gurney
glanced
sharply
at
him
turned
and
disappeared
through
the
study
window
her
manner
implied
that
if
he
had
harmed
fielding
she
would
make
him
feel
it
she
came
back
still
unsmiling
no
you
have
not
tired
him
then
said
he
as
he
followed
her
into
the
i
am
forgiven
yes
but
i
did
not
say
you
had
not
done
him
harm
the
lady
paused
in
her
amenities
to
pour
out
his
tea
miss
gurney
he
said
as
he
took
the
cup
from
her
can
you
tell
me
the
name
of
the
friend
who
sent
my
book
to
you
no
i
afraid
i
can
not
i
see
after
all
i
am
not
forgiven
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
you
ought
to
be
i
heard
what
he
said
to
you
she
went
on
almost
fiercely
why
i
hate
young
poets
he
says
there
is
only
you
to
hate
so
of
course
you
hate
me
i
think
i
do
i
wish
i
had
never
heard
of
you
i
wish
he
had
never
seen
you
i
hope
you
will
never
come
again
i
have
looked
at
your
poems
that
he
praises
so
he
says
they
are
beautiful
very
well
i
shall
hate
them
they
are
beautiful
he
says
they
have
more
life
in
them
than
his
do
you
understand
why
i
hate
them
and
you
he
was
young
before
you
came
here
you
have
made
him
feel
that
he
is
old
that
he
must
die
i
do
know
what
else
he
said
to
you
shall
i
tell
you
what
he
said
to
me
he
said
that
the
world
will
forget
him
when
it
listening
to
you
you
misunderstood
him
he
thought
that
he
understood
her
but
it
puzzled
him
that
adoring
fielding
as
she
did
she
yet
permitted
herself
to
doubt
do
you
suppose
i
thought
that
he
grudged
you
your
fame
because
he
does
but
i
do
you
need
at
present
it
only
exists
in
his
imagination
that
enough
if
it
exists
there
you
mean
it
will
go
down
the
ages
she
nodded
and
you
do
want
it
to
go
not
unless
his
goes
too
and
goes
farther
you
need
hardly
be
afraid
i
afraid
only
he
has
always
stood
alone
so
high
that
no
one
has
touched
him
i
always
seen
him
that
way
all
my
life
and
i
ca
bear
to
see
him
any
other
way
i
ca
bear
any
one
to
touch
him
or
even
to
come
anywhere
near
him
no
one
ever
will
touch
him
whoever
comes
after
him
he
will
always
stand
alone
and
he
added
gently
you
will
always
see
him
so
yes
she
said
but
in
a
voice
that
told
him
she
was
still
unconsoled
if
i
had
seen
him
when
he
was
young
i
suppose
i
should
always
see
him
young
not
that
i
care
about
that
so
much
his
youth
is
the
part
of
him
that
interests
me
least
perhaps
because
it
was
never
in
any
way
a
part
of
me
he
looked
at
her
did
she
realize
how
far
fielding
youth
if
report
spoke
truly
had
belonged
to
or
in
her
own
words
been
a
part
of
other
women
did
she
resent
their
part
in
him
he
thought
not
it
was
not
so
much
that
she
was
jealous
of
fielding
youth
as
that
she
shrank
from
any
appearance
of
disloyalty
to
his
age
and
yet
she
said
i
feel
that
no
one
has
a
right
to
be
young
when
he
is
old
i
hate
young
poets
because
they
are
young
i
hate
my
own
youth
her
youth
yes
it
was
youth
that
leapt
quivering
in
her
tragic
face
like
a
blown
flame
her
body
hardly
counted
except
as
fuel
to
the
eager
and
incessant
fire
do
hate
it
he
said
it
is
the
most
beautiful
thing
you
have
to
give
him
ah
if
i
give
it
him
he
smiled
you
have
given
it
him
he
is
old
when
he
can
inspire
such
devotion
he
is
to
be
envied
he
rose
and
held
out
his
hand
as
she
took
it
miss
gaze
rested
on
him
a
moment
and
grew
soft
if
you
want
to
know
it
was
lucia
harden
who
sent
me
your
poems
said
she
and
he
knew
that
for
once
miss
gurney
had
betrayed
a
secret
he
wondered
what
had
made
her
change
her
mind
he
wondered
whether
lucia
had
really
made
a
secret
of
it
he
wondered
what
the
secret
had
to
do
with
fielding
and
wondering
he
went
away
envying
him
the
love
that
kept
its
own
divine
fire
burning
for
him
on
his
hearth
chapter
li
there
were
times
when
rickman
harassed
by
his
engagement
reviewed
his
literary
position
with
dismay
of
success
as
men
count
success
he
had
none
he
was
recognized
as
a
poet
by
perhaps
a
score
of
people
to
a
few
hundreds
he
was
a
mere
name
in
the
literary
papers
to
the
great
mass
of
his
he
was
not
even
a
name
he
had
gone
his
own
way
and
remained
obscure
while
his
friends
jewdwine
and
maddox
had
gone
theirs
and
won
for
themselves
solid
reputations
as
for
rankin
turned
novelist
he
had
achieved
celebrity
they
had
not
been
able
to
impart
to
him
the
secret
of
success
but
the
recognition
and
something
more
than
recognition
of
the
veteran
poet
consoled
him
for
the
years
of
failure
and
he
felt
that
he
could
go
through
many
such
on
the
strength
of
it
the
incident
was
so
momentous
that
he
was
moved
to
speak
of
it
to
jewdwine
and
to
maddox
as
everything
that
interested
him
interested
maddox
he
related
it
to
maddox
in
full
but
with
jewdwine
such
was
his
exceeding
delicacy
he
observed
a
certain
modest
reticence
still
there
was
no
diminution
in
his
engaging
candour
his
innocent
assumption
that
jewdwine
would
be
as
pleased
and
excited
as
maddox
and
himself
he
really
seemed
said
he
selecting
from
among
utterances
to
think
the
things
were
great
jewdwine
raised
his
eyebrows
my
dear
rickman
i
congratulate
you
he
paused
for
so
long
that
his
next
remark
thoughtfully
produced
seemed
to
have
no
reference
to
rickman
communication
fielding
is
getting
very
old
if
rickman
had
been
in
a
state
of
mind
to
attend
carefully
to
jewdwine
manner
he
might
have
gathered
that
the
incident
had
caused
him
some
uneasiness
it
had
indeed
provided
the
editor
of
with
much
matter
for
disagreeable
thought
as
it
happened
after
months
of
grave
deliberation
he
had
lately
had
occasion
to
form
a
very
definite
opinion
as
to
the
value
of
rickman
the
journalist
he
knew
that
rickman
the
journalist
had
no
more
deadly
enemy
than
rickman
the
poet
and
at
that
particular
moment
he
did
not
greatly
care
to
be
reminded
of
his
existence
jewdwine
attitude
to
rickman
and
his
confidences
was
the
result
of
a
change
in
the
attitude
of
and
its
proprietors
was
on
the
eve
of
a
revolution
and
to
jewdwine
as
its
editor
rickman
the
journalist
had
suddenly
become
invaluable
the
revolution
itself
was
not
altogether
sudden
for
many
months
the
behaviour
of
had
been
a
spectacle
of
great
joy
to
the
young
men
of
its
contemporary
the
spirit
of
competition
had
latterly
seized
upon
that
most
severely
academic
of
reviews
and
it
was
now
making
desperate
efforts
to
be
popular
it
was
as
if
a
and
don
suddenly
alive
to
the
existence
of
athletic
sports
in
his
neighbourhood
should
insist
on
entering
himself
for
all
the
events
clothed
uniquely
if
inappropriately
in
cap
and
gown
he
would
be
a
very
moving
figure
in
the
eyes
of
hilarious
and
immortal
youth
and
such
a
figure
did
in
its
latter
days
present
but
the
proprietors
were
going
to
change
all
that
was
about
to
be
withdrawn
from
circulation
and
reissued
in
a
new
form
under
the
new
title
of
as
if
aware
of
the
shocking
incongruity
it
was
going
to
fling
off
its
cap
and
gown
whatever
its
staying
power
might
be
its
spirit
and
its
outward
appearance
should
henceforth
in
no
way
differ
from
those
of
other
competitors
in
the
race
for
money
and
position
while
the
details
of
the
change
were
being
planned
in
the
offices
of
the
burning
question
for
the
proprietors
was
this
would
their
editor
their
great
their
unique
and
lonely
editor
be
prepared
to
go
with
them
or
would
he
and
with
him
his
brilliant
and
enthusiastic
staff
insist
on
standing
by
the
principles
that
had
been
the
glory
of
the
paper
and
its
ruin
jewdwine
had
shown
himself
fairly
amenable
so
far
but
would
he
be
any
use
to
them
when
it
really
came
to
the
point
to
jewdwine
that
point
was
the
in
his
career
he
had
had
to
put
that
burning
question
to
himself
was
he
after
all
prepared
to
stand
by
his
principles
it
was
pretty
certain
that
if
he
did
his
principles
would
not
stand
by
him
was
there
anything
in
them
that
stand
at
all
against
the
brutal
pressure
that
was
moulding
literature
at
the
present
hour
no
organ
of
philosophic
criticism
could
at
the
present
hour
exist
unless
created
and
maintained
by
jewdwine
and
at
vast
expense
his
position
was
becoming
more
unique
and
more
lonely
every
day
quite
intolerably
lonely
and
unique
for
jewdwine
after
all
was
human
he
longed
for
eminence
but
not
for
such
eminence
as
meant
isolation
isolation
is
not
powerful
and
even
more
than
for
eminence
he
longed
for
power
he
longed
for
it
with
the
passion
of
a
weak
will
governed
despotically
by
a
strong
intellect
it
amounted
to
a
positive
obsession
the
tyranny
of
a
cold
and
sane
idea
he
knew
perfectly
well
now
what
his
position
as
editor
of
was
worth
compared
with
that
great
that
noble
but
solitary
person
even
maddox
had
more
power
but
the
editor
of
by
a
few
trifling
concessions
to
the
spirit
of
modernity
would
in
a
very
short
time
carry
all
before
him
he
must
then
either
run
with
the
race
or
drop
out
of
it
altogether
and
between
these
two
courses
jewdwine
with
all
his
genius
for
hesitation
could
not
waver
after
much
deliberation
he
had
consented
not
without
some
show
of
condescension
to
give
his
name
and
leadership
to
metropolis
and
he
reaped
the
reward
of
his
plasticity
in
a
substantial
addition
to
his
income
this
great
change
in
the
organization
of
the
review
called
for
certain
corresponding
changes
in
its
staff
and
it
was
here
that
rickman
came
in
he
had
been
retained
on
partly
in
recognition
of
his
brilliance
partly
by
way
of
satisfying
the
claims
of
magnanimity
on
he
had
not
proved
plastic
either
as
or
as
contributor
he
did
not
fit
in
well
with
the
traditions
of
the
paper
for
he
was
to
jewdwine
modernity
incarnate
the
living
spirit
of
revolt
to
be
bound
down
with
difficulty
by
the
editorial
hand
looking
back
on
the
record
of
the
past
four
years
jewdwine
marvelled
how
and
why
it
was
that
he
had
kept
him
a
score
of
times
he
had
been
tempted
to
dismiss
him
after
some
fresh
enormity
and
a
score
of
times
rickman
had
endeared
himself
by
the
seductive
graces
of
his
style
but
rickman
on
the
staff
of
was
jewdwine
considered
rickman
in
the
right
place
not
only
could
he
now
be
allowed
to
let
loose
his
joyous
individuality
without
prejudice
to
the
principles
of
that
paper
for
the
paper
strictly
speaking
would
have
no
principles
but
he
was
indispensable
if
it
was
to
preserve
the
distinction
which
its
editor
still
desired
jewdwine
had
no
need
of
the
poet
but
of
the
journalistic
side
of
rickman
he
had
endless
need
it
was
a
baser
faculty
but
his
care
must
be
to
develop
it
to
train
it
to
handle
it
judiciously
until
by
handling
he
had
made
it
pliable
to
all
the
uses
of
his
paper
jewdwine
had
a
genius
for
licking
young
men
into
shape
he
could
hardly
recognize
that
band
of
awkward
and
enthusiastic
followers
in
his
present
highly
disciplined
and
meritorious
staff
none
of
them
were
like
rickman
none
of
them
had
done
anything
to
rouse
an
uneasy
suspicion
of
their
genius
still
none
of
them
were
precisely
fitted
for
his
present
purpose
rickman
the
poet
of
course
you
could
not
lick
into
shape
his
shape
plastic
only
under
the
divine
fire
was
fashioned
by
the
fingers
of
the
god
but
rickman
the
journalist
once
get
him
on
to
the
right
journal
would
prove
to
be
made
of
less
unmanageable
stuff
if
he
had
not
hitherto
proved
manageable
that
was
no
doubt
because
hitherto
he
had
been
employed
on
the
wrong
journal
and
yet
when
he
came
to
discuss
the
change
of
programme
with
the
different
members
of
his
staff
some
of
whom
he
was
giving
their
dismissal
it
was
with
rickman
whom
he
proposed
to
retain
that
he
felt
the
most
acute
embarrassment
rickman
although
at
the
moment
dining
with
jewdwine
was
so
abominably
direct
i
see
he
said
after
listening
to
a
lengthy
exposition
of
the
proprietors
view
they
want
to
popularize
the
thing
jewdwine
winced
perceptibly
well
hardly
said
he
in
that
case
they
would
have
been
obliged
to
change
their
editor
we
certainly
want
to
draw
a
rather
larger
public
than
we
have
done
and
to
do
that
we
must
make
concessions
to
modernity
there
no
doubt
that
the
paper
interests
have
suffered
from
its
tradition
we
have
been
too
exclusive
too
detached
we
can
no
longer
afford
to
be
detached
we
propose
to
abandon
the
tradition
in
favour
of
well
of
a
somewhat
broader
attitude
he
looked
keenly
at
rickman
as
if
he
defied
him
to
put
it
any
other
way
i
see
we
either
got
to
take
a
more
genial
view
of
our
contemporaries
or
scoot
you
may
put
it
that
way
if
you
like
it
simply
means
that
if
we
are
to
appeal
to
a
wider
public
we
must
take
a
wider
view
it
surely
in
the
interests
of
the
public
of
literature
that
we
should
not
narrow
the
influence
of
the
paper
any
more
than
we
can
help
not
make
the
best
criticism
inaccessible
he
continued
to
take
the
lofty
and
the
noble
view
the
habit
was
inveterate
but
his
last
remark
started
him
on
the
way
of
of
course
i
could
go
on
with
the
paper
if
i
had
come
to
see
this
for
myself
the
fact
is
you
can
not
run
a
leading
review
on
abstract
principles
rickman
forbore
to
smile
at
the
fulfilment
of
his
prophecy
absolute
had
been
obliged
to
climb
down
not
said
jewdwine
if
that
review
is
really
to
lead
public
opinion
and
certainly
not
said
rickman
if
public
opinion
is
to
lead
the
review
in
either
case
said
jewdwine
nobly
the
principles
remain
only
they
not
applied
they
are
not
applied
because
there
is
nothing
to
apply
them
to
in
the
present
state
of
literature
a
review
like
has
no
reason
for
its
existence
i
do
know
it
was
a
very
useful
protest
against
some
forms
of
modernity
my
dear
fellow
modernity
simply
means
democracy
and
when
once
democracy
has
been
forced
on
us
there
no
good
protesting
any
longer
all
the
same
you
go
on
protesting
you
know
as
a
harmless
private
person
yes
as
a
critic
i
must
accept
a
certain
amount
of
defeat
at
the
hands
of
the
majority
but
you
do
happen
to
believe
in
the
majority
i
do
believe
in
it
said
he
bitterly
i
believe
that
it
has
destroyed
criticism
by
destroying
literature
a
critic
only
exists
through
the
existence
of
great
men
and
there
are
no
great
men
nowadays
only
a
great
number
of
little
men
i
see
othello
occupation
gone
not
at
all
othello
occupation
only
beginning
you
criticize
these
people
but
you
must
review
them
and
i
assure
you
it
means
far
more
labour
and
a
finer
discrimination
to
pick
out
your
little
man
from
a
crowd
of
little
men
than
to
recognize
your
great
man
when
you
see
him
when
you
see
him
ah
yes
i
see
him
but
where
is
he
show
me
said
jewdwine
one
work
of
unmistakable
genius
published
any
time
in
the
last
five
the
last
ten
years
rickman
looked
at
him
and
said
nothing
and
to
jewdwine
his
silence
was
singularly
uncomfortable
he
would
have
been
more
uneasy
still
but
for
his
conviction
that
the
serenity
in
rickman
eyes
was
reflected
from
the
eyes
of
fielding
rickman
he
thought
was
rather
too
obviously
elated
at
the
great
man
praise
and
the
exhibition
of
elation
was
unpleasant
to
him
worse
than
all
he
realized
that
rickman
in
spite
of
his
serenity
was
hurt
on
the
top
of
that
came
a
miserable
misgiving
as
to
the
worthiness
of
his
own
attitude
to
his
friend
as
for
rickman
he
had
no
feeling
that
he
could
have
put
into
words
beyond
owning
in
his
heart
that
he
was
hurt
he
had
never
before
had
any
occasion
for
such
a
confession
he
felt
it
to
be
humiliating
both
to
jewdwine
and
himself
sometimes
in
moments
of
depression
he
had
suspected
that
it
was
jewdwine
coldness
that
preserved
his
incorruptibility
but
he
had
so
sincere
a
desire
for
purity
in
their
relations
that
he
had
submitted
without
resentment
to
the
freezing
process
that
ensured
it
he
had
in
reserve
his
expectation
of
the
day
when
by
some
superlative
achievement
he
would
take
that
soul
hitherto
invincible
by
storm
but
now
in
his
inmost
heart
he
owned
that
he
was
hurt
jewdwine
changed
the
subject
chapter
lii
when
jewdwine
changed
the
subject
it
was
to
intimate
that
his
friend
might
now
expect
a
salary
rising
steadily
with
the
fortunes
of
that
promise
to
marry
flossie
in
the
autumn
had
made
rickman
very
uneasy
on
this
head
the
sources
of
his
income
had
been
hitherto
uncertain
for
might
at
any
moment
cease
to
be
and
only
indomitable
hope
could
say
that
would
be
long
for
this
world
the
amount
of
his
income
too
depended
on
conditions
which
were
to
some
extent
beyond
his
own
control
it
had
never
sunk
below
a
hundred
and
fifty
and
had
never
risen
above
three
hundred
even
in
the
years
when
he
wrote
more
articles
than
poems
whereas
if
he
wrote
more
poems
than
articles
two
hundred
was
the
highest
figure
it
had
yet
attained
and
supposing
the
poems
came
and
the
articles
did
for
in
these
things
he
was
in
the
hands
of
the
god
therefore
he
had
long
been
a
prey
to
devastating
anxiety
but
he
hoped
great
things
from
the
transformation
of
it
certainly
promised
him
a
larger
and
more
certain
revenue
in
the
future
almost
justifying
his
marriage
in
the
autumn
it
had
been
expressly
understood
that
his
promise
to
flossie
was
to
be
fulfilled
only
if
possible
but
meanwhile
he
had
got
to
make
it
possible
for
flossie
in
spite
of
promise
kept
the
terror
of
her
perpetually
dangling
above
his
head
he
had
visited
vassell
hawkins
detestable
establishment
and
it
made
him
shudder
to
think
of
his
pretty
beaver
shut
up
in
a
little
mahogany
cage
with
her
bright
eyes
peeping
sad
and
shy
through
the
brass
netting
and
her
dear
little
nostrils
sniffing
the
villainous
alcoholic
air
but
as
the
time
approached
and
their
marriage
grew
every
day
more
certain
and
more
near
the
joy
and
excitement
of
the
bridegroom
were
mingled
with
an
inexplicable
terror
and
misgiving
he
had
been
disagreeably
impressed
by
the
manner
of
flossie
insistence
on
his
poverty
he
had
not
missed
the
fine
contempt
conveyed
by
all
her
references
to
his
profession
which
she
not
unjustly
regarded
as
the
cause
of
the
poverty
he
was
well
aware
that
his
genius
was
a
heavy
burden
for
so
small
a
thing
to
bear
and
his
chivalry
had
determined
that
it
should
lie
lightly
on
her
lest
it
should
crush
or
injure
her
it
was
part
of
her
engaging
innocence
that
she
knew
nothing
of
the
world
in
which
his
supremacy
began
and
hers
ended
that
she
had
not
even
suspected
its
existence
if
he
had
any
illusions
about
her
it
was
his
own
mind
that
created
and
controlled
them
he
delighted
in
them
deliberately
as
in
a
thing
of
his
creating
seeing
through
them
with
that
extraordinary
lucidity
of
his
yet
abandoning
himself
all
the
more
flossie
weakness
made
him
tender
her
very
faults
amused
him
as
for
his
future
he
could
not
conceive
of
his
marriage
as
in
any
way
affecting
him
as
a
poet
and
a
man
of
letters
while
the
little
suburban
eros
lit
his
low
flame
upon
the
hearth
his
genius
would
still
stand
apart
guarding
with
holy
hands
the
immortal
fire
for
those
two
flames
could
never
mingle
in
that
dream
he
saw
himself
travelling
with
ease
and
rapidity
along
two
infinite
lines
that
never
touched
and
never
diverged
a
feat
only
possible
given
two
rickmans
not
one
rickman
there
used
to
be
many
more
of
him
it
was
something
that
he
had
reduced
the
quantity
to
two
and
in
dreams
nothing
is
absurd
nothing
impossible
pity
that
the
conditions
of
waking
life
are
so
singularly
limited
at
first
it
had
been
only
a
simple
question
of
time
and
space
not
that
flossie
took
up
so
very
much
space
and
he
owned
that
she
left
him
plenty
of
time
for
the
everyday
work
that
paid
but
where
was
that
divine
solitude
where
were
those
long
days
of
nebulous
conception
where
the
days
when
he
removed
himself
as
it
were
and
watched
his
creations
careering
in
the
intellectual
void
the
days
when
keith
rickman
was
as
a
god
he
was
hardly
aware
how
fast
they
were
vanishing
already
and
where
would
they
be
in
two
months
time
it
was
on
his
tragedy
that
he
based
his
hopes
for
his
future
the
future
in
which
flossie
had
no
part
he
knew
that
the
plea
of
art
sounded
weak
before
the
inexorable
claims
of
nature
he
felt
that
something
ought
to
be
sacrificed
to
the
supreme
passion
but
he
could
give
up
his
tragedy
he
was
consumed
by
two
indomitable
passions
and
who
was
to
say
which
of
them
was
supreme
still
tragedies
in
blank
verse
were
a
luxury
and
flossie
had
more
than
once
pointed
out
to
him
he
could
afford
luxuries
he
would
sit
up
working
on
the
tragedy
till
long
past
midnight
and
when
he
woke
in
the
morning
his
sense
of
guilt
could
not
have
been
greater
if
he
had
been
indulging
in
the
most
hateful
orgies
but
you
ca
burn
even
genius
at
both
ends
and
his
paying
work
began
to
suffer
jewdwine
complained
that
it
was
not
up
to
his
usual
level
maddox
had
returned
several
articles
so
at
last
he
stuffed
his
tragedy
into
a
drawer
to
wait
there
for
a
diviner
hour
that
would
have
been
a
big
expensive
job
he
said
to
himself
i
suppose
it
possible
to
put
as
good
work
into
the
little
things
that
pay
but
i
shall
have
to
cut
myself
in
pieces
that
was
what
he
was
doing
now
changing
his
gold
into
copper
as
fast
as
he
could
so
many
pennies
for
one
sovereign
nobody
was
cheated
he
knew
that
in
his
talent
his
mere
journalistic
talent
there
was
a
genius
that
no
amount
of
journalism
had
as
yet
subdued
but
he
had
an
awful
vision
of
the
future
when
he
saw
himself
swallowed
up
body
and
soul
in
journalism
the
gods
were
dead
but
there
were
still
men
and
columns
that
would
be
the
inevitable
surrender
to
reality
to
have
no
part
in
the
triumph
of
the
poetic
legions
but
to
march
with
the
rank
and
file
to
a
detestable
music
not
his
own
a
mere
mercenary
ingloriously
fighting
in
a
foreign
cause
to
jewdwine
jewdwine
once
incorruptible
it
seemed
that
rickman
was
preparing
himself
very
suitably
for
the
new
campaign
but
maddox
mourned
as
he
returned
those
articles
and
when
he
heard
of
the
approaching
marriage
which
explained
them
he
was
frantic
he
rushed
up
on
sunday
afternoon
and
marched
rickman
out
into
the
suburbs
and
on
to
a
lonely
place
on
hampstead
heath
and
there
for
the
space
of
one
hour
with
his
arm
linked
in
rickman
he
wrestled
with
rickman
for
his
body
and
his
soul
jewdwine
cry
had
been
beware
of
the
friendship
of
little
men
the
burden
of
maddox
was
beware
of
the
love
of
little
women
that
all
you
know
about
it
maddy
the
love
of
great
women
absorbs
you
dominates
you
the
little
women
leave
you
free
maddox
groaned
a
fat
lot
of
freedom
you
get
ricky
when
you
married
rickman
looked
straight
before
him
to
the
deep
blue
hills
of
the
west
as
if
freedom
lay
on
the
other
side
of
them
good
god
he
said
what
am
i
to
do
i
must
marry
i
ca
go
back
to
poppy
grace
and
her
sort
if
that
all
said
maddox
i
do
see
much
difference
except
that
marriage
is
worse
it
lasts
longer
whereupon
rickman
blushed
and
said
that
was
all
and
that
maddox
was
a
brute
he
would
change
his
opinion
when
he
knew
miss
walker
before
very
long
he
had
an
opportunity
of
changing
it
rickman
had
been
in
error
when
he
told
flossie
that
if
she
would
consent
to
marry
him
he
would
never
again
be
for
he
was
ill
the
first
week
in
september
not
two
years
after
he
had
made
that
statement
the
fielding
episode
when
the
first
fine
stimulus
was
over
had
left
him
miserable
and
restless
it
was
as
if
he
had
heard
the
sound
of
lucia
harden
voice
passing
through
the
immeasurable
darkness
that
divided
them
and
now
he
seemed
to
be
suffering
from
something
not
unlike
the
nervous
fever
that
had
attacked
him
once
before
at
harmouth
complicated
this
time
by
a
severe
cold
on
the
chest
caught
by
walking
about
through
pouring
rain
in
great
agony
of
mind
for
flossie
who
may
have
felt
latterly
that
she
had
chanced
upon
another
season
of
depression
in
her
woman
trade
that
illness
was
a
piece
of
amazing
good
luck
coming
as
it
did
at
the
moment
of
misgivings
it
not
only
drew
them
together
just
as
they
were
drifting
insensibly
apart
but
it
revealed
them
to
each
other
in
a
tenderer
and
serener
light
there
was
a
little
hard
spot
in
flossie
which
was
impervious
to
the
subtler
charm
of
rickman
when
he
was
well
but
rickman
ill
and
at
her
mercy
confined
to
the
bed
where
so
long
as
flossie
waited
on
him
he
lay
very
quietly
with
the
sheet
drawn
tight
up
to
his
chin
in
a
state
of
touching
dependence
and
humiliation
was
a
wholly
different
person
from
the
stormy
and
incomprehensible
rickman
who
for
more
than
two
years
had
struggled
so
madly
in
her
toils
and
if
to
the
eye
of
downey
flossie
appeared
untouched
by
the
really
heartrending
pathos
of
his
attitude
in
sleep
beholding
unmoved
his
huddled
boyish
form
under
the
blankets
one
arm
laid
slack
along
the
bed
the
other
thrust
out
straight
into
the
cold
outside
it
if
she
left
downey
to
cover
the
poor
fellow
up
wondering
why
on
earth
the
girl
could
sit
there
and
never
do
it
if
when
he
woke
she
missed
the
extreme
poignancy
of
appeal
in
the
murmurs
that
followed
her
as
she
went
about
her
business
in
the
room
it
may
be
that
in
that
unaccustomed
service
the
hidden
prescient
motherhood
in
her
was
awakened
and
appeased
flossie
being
still
under
the
dominion
of
her
dream
as
yet
it
struggled
blindly
with
her
invincible
propriety
a
struggle
poor
rickman
was
made
aware
of
by
the
manner
of
her
approaches
the
secrecy
and
hesitation
of
her
touch
but
the
little
clerk
undoubtedly
found
that
patting
pillows
straightening
coverlets
and
making
mustard
plasters
was
an
employment
more
satisfying
to
her
nature
than
the
perpetual
handling
of
bank
notes
and
to
rickman
lying
there
with
his
hungry
heart
filled
for
the
time
quite
full
with
its
own
humility
and
gratitude
lying
in
a
helplessness
that
had
in
it
something
soothing
and
agreeable
feeling
the
soft
shy
woman
hands
about
his
bed
following
with
affectionate
remorseful
eyes
her
coming
and
going
or
watching
as
she
sat
patiently
mending
his
socks
it
came
with
the
freshness
of
a
new
discovery
that
she
was
after
all
a
very
engaging
little
beaver
he
had
never
for
one
instant
glorified
his
love
for
her
he
understood
it
too
thoroughly
it
was
love
as
nature
loves
to
have
it
honest
enough
too
but
of
its
kind
singularly
devoid
of
any
inspiring
quality
flossie
had
never
moved
him
to
the
making
of
sonnets
or
of
songs
moreover
he
had
discovered
in
her
a
certain
lack
of
tenderness
or
of
the
outward
signs
of
tenderness
not
but
what
flossie
commanded
all
the
foolish
endearing
language
of
young
love
only
she
was
apt
to
lavish
it
on
little
details
of
attire
on
furniture
on
things
seen
in
and
passionately
desired
but
there
was
something
very
transfiguring
in
the
firelight
of
his
bedroom
hearth
as
he
lay
in
it
enjoying
the
pure
sweet
foretaste
of
domestic
felicity
it
was
as
if
he
saw
more
clearly
into
himself
and
her
and
the
life
that
would
so
soon
make
them
one
if
it
was
not
the
best
life
he
told
himself
that
of
its
kind
it
would
be
very
good
he
had
no
doubt
now
that
flossie
loved
him
he
was
led
to
this
certainty
by
the
maternal
quality
in
her
present
dealings
with
him
when
perhaps
it
should
have
warned
him
rather
that
these
cares
were
not
for
him
flossie
had
somewhat
elaborated
her
dream
bearing
the
fascinating
name
of
muriel
maud
it
had
grown
softer
and
rosier
than
ever
she
could
not
any
longer
deny
its
mysterious
association
with
keith
rickman
though
she
would
have
died
rather
than
that
keith
should
have
suspected
it
and
now
as
she
sat
mending
keith
socks
her
fancy
all
the
time
was
busy
fashioning
delicious
garments
for
her
dream
flossie
never
pursued
her
vision
of
muriel
maud
beyond
the
period
of
enchanting
infancy
when
it
outgrew
the
tender
folly
of
those
garments
it
was
dismissed
from
flossie
fancy
with
unmaternal
harshness
therefore
it
appeared
eternally
innocent
and
young
mortal
in
a
delicate
immortality
in
fact
viewing
her
life
too
in
the
light
of
the
bedroom
firelight
flossie
was
herself
deceived
they
were
both
blissfully
unaware
that
nature
cares
nothing
about
love
but
was
bent
upon
using
them
for
the
only
end
she
does
care
about
the
end
that
gives
to
love
the
illusion
of
its
own
eternity
but
maddox
saw
through
it
in
a
minute
it
was
in
the
earlier
stages
of
the
poet
illness
and
maddox
had
happened
to
put
his
head
into
rickman
room
at
the
moment
when
flossie
compelled
by
downey
was
helping
to
put
a
stinging
mustard
plaster
on
his
chest
they
shrieked
and
maddox
instantly
withdrew
he
painted
the
scene
afterwards
for
rankin
in
the
lurid
and
symbolic
colours
of
his
celtic
fancy
talk
of
samson
among
the
philistines
it
nothing
to
in
that
d
d
there
was
a
woman
on
each
side
of
his
bed
they
got
him
down
on
it
they
were
pinning
the
poor
little
chap
in
his
blankets
i
could
just
see
face
between
their
shoulders
it
was
very
red
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
expression
on
it
never
the
agony
rankin
the
hopeless
unutterable
agony
what
were
they
doing
to
him
i
could
see
properly
but
i
think
they
were
cutting
his
hair
off
he
declared
later
that
he
had
distinctly
heard
the
squeaking
of
that
young
delilah
scissors
we
not
told
whether
delilah
was
wife
said
he
but
the
scriptures
were
never
wrong
on
a
point
of
human
nature
at
which
rankin
looked
depressed
for
he
too
was
thinking
of
getting
married
though
as
maddox
reminded
him
for
his
comfort
not
to
miss
flossie
walker
is
our
urged
rankin
the
man
to
show
wisdom
in
choosing
a
wife
he
is
the
man
to
marry
at
all
did
you
expect
him
to
live
like
an
anchorite
then
i
did
expect
anything
he
might
have
lived
as
he
liked
provided
he
did
ruin
himself
as
he
doing
now
and
though
maddox
now
saw
that
young
delilah
frequently
and
always
at
her
prettiest
and
her
best
he
did
not
change
his
opinion
chapter
liii
it
was
now
the
third
week
in
september
and
the
wedding
was
fixed
for
the
of
october
everything
was
fixed
even
ideas
on
the
subject
of
her
trousseau
there
never
was
a
little
woman
so
unwavering
in
her
choice
of
such
things
as
clothes
and
furniture
to
be
married
in
ivory
white
and
to
go
away
in
powder
blue
to
have
a
furnished
in
imitation
rosewood
and
tapestry
and
a
in
stamped
velvet
and
black
oak
imitation
too
had
been
flossie
firm
determination
from
the
first
it
saves
endless
time
and
contention
when
a
young
woman
so
absolutely
knows
her
own
mind
not
but
what
she
required
approval
and
support
in
her
decisions
otherwise
she
would
have
been
hardly
recognizable
as
a
young
woman
and
for
rickman
to
go
shopping
with
the
beaver
in
tottenham
court
road
to
follow
her
undeviating
course
through
the
furniture
galleries
to
note
the
infallible
instinct
by
which
she
made
for
and
seized
upon
the
objects
of
her
choice
to
see
the
austerity
with
which
she
resisted
the
seductions
of
the
salesman
who
sought
to
entangle
her
with
a
more
expensive
article
the
calmness
of
her
mind
in
dealing
with
the
most
intricate
problems
of
measurement
and
price
was
to
be
led
a
helpless
captive
in
a
triumph
of
practical
ability
ability
good
lord
was
there
ever
anything
like
flossie
grasp
of
all
facts
that
can
be
expressed
in
figures
his
brain
reeled
before
the
terrifying
velocity
of
her
mental
arithmetic
what
a
little
woman
it
was
to
do
sums
in
the
top
of
its
head
not
that
she
dragged
him
on
the
chain
for
ever
there
were
idyllic
delicious
thrilling
pauses
in
her
progress
when
she
tried
every
chair
in
succession
in
the
suite
when
she
settled
herself
in
the
tapestry
one
before
the
little
rosewood
spread
for
the
heightening
of
the
illusion
with
a
all
complete
when
she
pretended
to
pour
out
tea
smiling
over
the
in
the
prettiest
delight
with
such
a
smile
she
would
welcome
him
with
such
a
smile
she
would
pour
out
his
tea
when
he
came
back
from
fleet
street
to
the
home
that
was
to
be
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
at
the
moment
flossie
was
only
smiling
at
the
though
he
stood
aloof
from
the
anticipatory
scene
as
he
looked
at
her
he
grew
positively
weak
with
tenderness
in
everything
flossie
had
her
way
when
they
climbed
as
they
inevitably
did
to
the
upper
galleries
he
indeed
offered
some
show
of
resistance
when
she
insisted
on
choosing
a
terrible
bedstead
of
brass
with
ornaments
but
to
do
him
justice
it
was
sheer
nervous
terror
which
prompted
the
brutal
remark
that
really
ornaments
were
more
than
he
could
stand
for
he
melted
and
gave
in
at
once
at
the
sight
of
flossie
feeling
the
rosy
down
coverlet
with
her
little
hands
when
their
eyes
met
flossie
face
was
as
rosy
as
the
coverlet
so
that
the
attendant
spirit
of
commerce
himself
turned
from
them
abashed
that
there
would
that
there
must
be
such
a
moment
keith
had
had
a
horrible
foreboding
as
he
followed
up
the
stairs
nobody
could
have
been
more
happy
than
flossie
following
the
dream
in
tottenham
court
road
and
rickman
was
happy
because
she
was
happy
for
a
whole
fortnight
and
then
for
the
first
time
they
quarrelled
and
this
was
how
it
happened
they
were
going
to
live
at
ealing
not
because
they
liked
it
but
because
the
neighbourhood
was
cheap
flossie
had
said
when
we
rich
we
go
to
kensington
and
he
had
answered
with
an
odious
flippancy
yes
and
when
we
die
we
go
to
heaven
but
for
the
present
flossie
wise
flossie
who
loved
economy
even
more
than
kensington
was
content
with
ealing
that
she
was
obliged
to
be
content
with
it
made
her
feel
naturally
that
she
was
entitled
to
gratification
on
every
other
point
it
was
not
over
ealing
then
that
they
quarrelled
but
over
the
choosing
of
the
house
flossie
was
all
for
a
gay
little
villa
with
nice
clean
white
paint
about
it
only
two
minutes
from
the
tram
he
for
a
little
house
with
jasmine
all
over
it
and
a
garden
all
grass
and
lilac
bushes
at
the
back
he
said
the
garden
would
be
nice
to
sit
in
she
said
what
was
the
good
of
sitting
in
a
garden
when
you
had
to
walk
ever
so
far
to
the
tram
he
retorted
that
walking
was
a
reason
for
sitting
and
she
that
if
it
came
to
that
they
could
sit
in
the
house
she
would
hear
of
the
old
brown
house
nor
he
of
the
villa
he
was
peculiarly
sensitive
to
his
surroundings
the
villa
said
he
is
a
detestable
little
den
it
is
said
she
it
got
a
lovely
bay
window
in
the
drawing
room
and
a
little
balcony
on
the
top
but
there
is
a
quiet
place
in
it
dear
where
i
could
write
oh
that
all
you
thinking
of
well
there
is
really
whereas
here
they
were
going
now
through
the
little
brown
house
there
a
jolly
big
room
at
the
back
where
you
can
see
miles
away
over
the
fields
towards
harrow
oh
you
got
time
to
look
out
of
the
window
have
you
though
you
so
busy
never
mind
the
window
let
look
at
the
house
what
wrong
with
it
what
wrong
with
the
house
it
wo
suit
the
furniture
what
wrong
with
it
you
mean
the
furniture
wo
suit
it
the
furniture
chosen
and
the
house
is
there
no
good
going
back
on
that
look
here
this
is
the
room
i
meant
they
had
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
little
brown
house
and
flossie
had
hardly
condescended
to
glance
through
the
doors
he
had
opened
on
their
way
he
opened
one
now
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
this
time
she
looked
in
it
would
make
all
the
difference
to
me
floss
he
said
humbly
if
i
had
a
place
like
this
when
i
want
to
get
away
to
write
when
you
want
to
get
away
from
me
you
mean
her
lips
shook
she
looked
round
her
with
angry
eyes
as
if
jealous
of
the
place
and
all
that
he
meant
to
do
in
it
it
was
a
large
room
with
a
wide
window
looking
on
to
the
garden
and
away
across
meadows
and
cornfields
to
harrow
hill
with
its
thin
church
spire
the
window
was
guarded
with
iron
bars
the
was
designed
in
little
circles
and
in
each
circle
there
were
figures
of
little
boys
and
girls
absurd
and
gay
so
many
hundreds
of
little
figures
and
so
absurd
and
gay
that
to
sit
in
that
room
surrounded
by
them
to
look
at
them
and
endeavour
to
count
them
was
to
go
mad
but
those
figures
fascinated
flossie
oh
lord
what
a
beastly
said
he
i
think
it
sweet
said
she
and
though
she
was
going
to
let
him
have
the
house
she
was
ready
to
quarrel
with
him
again
about
the
and
then
in
the
corner
by
the
window
they
came
upon
a
child
toy
a
little
wooden
horse
broken
he
pointed
it
out
to
her
some
kiddy
must
have
left
that
there
of
course
said
she
it
been
a
nursery
and
i
say
keith
i
think
it
must
have
how
do
you
make
that
out
it
could
have
been
long
here
do
you
see
the
all
new
he
thought
that
was
rather
sharp
of
her
the
practical
beaver
and
yet
she
said
continuing
her
train
of
induction
it
could
if
it
had
they
never
have
left
here
ah
that
was
not
sharp
it
was
something
better
there
was
after
all
about
his
beaver
a
certain
poetry
and
tenderness
she
picked
up
the
little
wooden
horse
and
held
it
in
her
hands
and
adjusted
its
loosened
mane
and
mended
its
broken
legs
fitting
the
edges
delicately
with
her
clever
fingers
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
as
she
bent
over
the
toy
her
face
grew
soft
again
when
she
lifted
her
head
her
eyes
rested
on
him
but
without
seeing
him
never
had
flossie
had
so
poignant
a
vision
of
muriel
maud
he
looked
at
her
with
a
new
wonder
in
his
heart
for
the
first
time
he
was
made
aware
of
the
change
that
two
years
had
worked
in
her
she
had
grown
he
thought
finer
in
growing
firmer
her
body
in
its
maturity
was
acquiring
a
strength
and
richness
that
had
been
wanting
in
its
youth
as
if
through
that
time
of
waiting
it
were
being
fashioned
for
the
end
it
waited
for
but
that
was
not
all
she
had
clothed
herself
unconsciously
with
poetry
she
stood
for
a
moment
transfigured
before
him
a
woman
with
sweet
eyes
beholding
her
desired
destiny
from
far
her
soul
for
a
moment
rose
in
her
face
like
a
star
a
dim
prophetic
star
that
trembled
between
darkness
and
dawn
he
knew
that
she
saw
herself
now
as
the
possible
mother
of
his
children
the
anger
and
the
jealousy
were
over
and
all
of
a
sudden
she
gave
in
you
can
have
the
house
if
you
like
keith
all
right
i
do
like
it
that
a
dear
little
beaver
as
he
approached
her
her
glance
fled
i
did
say
you
could
have
the
room
i
want
to
keep
it
empty
he
put
his
arm
round
her
and
led
her
to
the
window
what
do
you
want
to
keep
it
empty
for
flossie
her
poor
little
thoughts
surprised
and
dismayed
went
scurrying
hither
and
thither
trying
to
hide
their
trail
oh
she
said
still
looking
away
from
him
to
store
things
in
he
drew
her
closer
to
him
and
kissed
her
tenderly
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
serene
and
happy
light
rested
on
the
garden
on
the
empty
house
and
on
the
empty
room
that
she
had
peopled
already
with
her
innocent
dream
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
that
remote
gaze
of
her
woman
eyes
abstracted
from
her
lover
unconsciously
desirous
of
the
end
beyond
desire
he
saw
revealed
the
mystery
the
sanctity
the
purity
of
wedded
love
and
seeing
it
he
forgave
her
that
momentary
abstraction
but
the
beaver
never
dreamed
she
was
far
too
practical
she
was
building
that
was
all
chapter
liv
that
evening
as
they
sat
down
to
dinner
it
might
have
been
noticed
that
mrs
downey
face
was
more
flushed
and
festal
than
it
had
been
since
the
day
was
fixed
for
rickman
wedding
and
departure
she
seated
herself
expansively
with
a
gay
rustling
of
many
frills
and
smiled
well
pleased
upon
the
arrangements
of
her
table
from
these
signs
it
was
evident
that
downey
was
expecting
another
boarder
a
boarder
of
whom
she
had
reason
to
be
proud
rickman
noticed
with
dismay
that
the
stranger
place
was
laid
beside
his
own
he
knew
them
so
well
these
eternal
restless
birds
of
passage
draggled
with
their
flight
from
one
to
another
the
only
tolerable
thing
about
them
was
that
being
here
they
were
gone
the
new
boarder
was
late
culpably
late
but
downey
was
proud
of
that
too
as
arguing
that
the
poor
bird
of
passage
had
stayed
to
smooth
her
ruffled
plumage
downey
approved
of
all
persons
who
thus
voluntarily
acknowledged
the
high
ceremonial
character
of
the
dinner
she
was
glad
that
rickman
would
appear
in
full
evening
dress
to
rush
away
in
the
middle
of
the
meal
a
splendour
the
more
glorious
being
brief
she
was
waiting
for
the
delightful
moment
when
she
would
explain
to
the
visitor
that
the
gentleman
who
had
just
left
the
room
was
rickman
the
reviewer
and
dramatic
critic
she
would
say
it
as
she
had
said
it
many
times
before
with
the
easy
accomplished
smile
of
the
hostess
familiar
with
celebrity
but
that
moment
never
came
the
very
anticipation
of
it
was
lost
in
the
thrill
of
the
visitor
belated
entrance
yet
nothing
could
have
been
quieter
than
the
manner
of
it
she
for
it
a
lady
came
into
the
room
as
if
she
had
lived
at
downey
all
her
life
and
knew
her
way
already
from
the
doorway
to
her
chair
when
she
said
i
so
sorry
i
afraid
i
rather
late
she
seemed
to
be
taking
for
granted
their
recognition
of
a
familiar
personal
characteristic
perhaps
it
was
because
she
was
so
tall
that
her
voice
sounded
like
music
dropped
downward
from
a
height
there
was
a
stir
a
movement
down
each
side
of
the
table
it
was
subtle
like
the
flutter
of
light
and
wind
and
sympathetic
answering
to
her
footfall
and
the
flowing
rhythm
of
her
gown
as
it
passed
downey
face
became
if
possible
more
luminous
miss
bramble
figure
if
possible
more
erect
a
feeble
flame
flickered
in
cheeks
soper
began
feeling
nervously
in
his
pocket
for
the
box
of
his
talisman
of
success
while
spinks
appeared
as
if
endeavouring
to
assume
a
mental
attitude
not
properly
his
own
miss
bishop
searched
for
any
crumbs
that
might
have
lodged
in
the
bosom
of
her
blouse
and
flossie
oh
flossie
became
more
demure
more
correct
more
absolutely
the
model
of
all
propriety
each
was
so
occupied
with
his
or
herself
that
no
one
noticed
the
very
remarkable
behaviour
of
rickman
he
rose
to
his
feet
he
turned
his
back
on
flossie
there
was
a
look
on
his
face
as
of
a
man
seized
with
sudden
terror
and
about
to
fly
in
turning
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
lucia
harden
he
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
stand
back
and
draw
her
chair
from
the
table
for
her
so
that
his
action
appeared
the
natural
movement
of
politeness
though
she
held
out
her
hand
by
an
instinct
of
recognition
there
was
a
perceptible
pause
before
she
spoke
he
had
known
that
it
was
she
before
he
saw
her
she
had
to
look
at
him
twice
to
make
quite
sure
and
then
being
sure
she
smiled
not
the
slow
cold
smile
of
politeness
that
dies
downwards
on
the
lips
but
the
swift
smile
of
pleasure
that
leaps
to
the
eyes
and
forehead
rickman
i
think
i
should
have
known
you
anywhere
else
but
i
did
expect
to
meet
you
here
he
looked
at
her
courageously
and
as
he
looked
there
fell
from
him
the
past
five
years
the
long
estranging
years
of
bitterness
and
misery
and
vain
desire
and
the
years
still
more
estranging
of
his
madness
and
his
folly
and
not
the
thinnest
phantom
shadow
of
time
divided
him
from
the
days
of
harmouth
that
moment
of
recognition
annihilated
all
between
a
lustre
of
his
life
swept
away
in
one
sweep
of
her
eyelids
dropped
fathom
deep
and
forgotten
in
the
gaze
of
her
pure
and
tender
eyes
it
was
not
the
lucia
of
their
last
meeting
the
tragic
and
terrible
lucia
who
had
been
so
divided
from
him
by
her
suffering
and
her
grief
as
she
had
appeared
to
him
on
that
evening
the
last
of
his
brief
incredible
happiness
when
he
sat
with
her
alone
in
the
at
court
house
and
she
had
declared
her
belief
in
him
so
she
appeared
to
him
now
the
unforgettable
movements
of
her
face
the
sweet
curve
of
her
mouth
the
upper
lip
so
soft
and
fine
that
it
seemed
to
quiver
delicately
with
the
rhythm
of
her
pulses
and
her
breath
the
turn
of
her
head
the
lifting
of
her
eyebrows
told
him
that
she
had
kept
no
memory
of
his
part
in
the
things
that
had
happened
after
that
and
he
too
forgot
with
lucia
sitting
at
his
right
hand
he
forgot
the
woman
sitting
at
his
left
he
forgot
the
house
of
bondage
and
he
forgot
that
other
house
where
the
wedding
chamber
yet
waited
for
the
bride
i
should
have
known
you
anywhere
his
eyes
dropped
and
he
said
no
more
that
act
of
recognition
had
only
lasted
a
second
but
it
had
made
its
mark
over
the
dim
fluttering
table
was
the
hush
of
a
profound
astonishment
he
neither
saw
nor
felt
it
nor
did
he
hear
downey
scattering
the
silence
with
agitated
apologies
you
excuse
us
beginning
miss
harden
but
it
rickman
night
at
the
theatre
miss
harden
looked
at
him
again
lifting
her
eyebrows
with
that
air
of
interested
inquiry
that
he
knew
so
well
and
yet
beyond
those
first
half
dozen
words
he
said
nothing
silly
boy
said
downey
to
herself
why
ca
he
say
he
sorry
he
has
to
go
i
sure
i
gave
him
his
opportunity
she
was
annoyed
at
his
rudeness
whether
he
were
sorry
or
not
he
went
at
his
appointed
time
he
never
knew
how
he
got
out
of
the
room
nor
how
he
had
behaved
before
going
he
had
simply
looked
at
her
held
her
hand
and
left
her
and
he
had
not
said
a
word
or
none
at
least
that
he
could
remember
miss
harden
was
it
seemed
the
guest
or
the
ostensible
guest
of
miss
roots
and
miss
roots
enjoyed
herself
delighting
openly
in
the
recovery
of
the
friend
she
had
lost
sight
of
for
so
many
years
but
from
downey
point
of
view
the
dinner
that
night
was
not
exactly
a
success
rickman
had
behaved
in
an
extraordinary
manner
soper
and
miss
bishop
had
never
looked
so
well
so
out
of
place
and
common
and
she
could
see
that
spinks
had
taken
advantage
of
the
general
consternation
to
help
himself
outrageously
to
ginger
lucia
took
her
friend
aside
when
it
was
over
you
might
have
told
me
he
was
here
said
she
my
dear
i
did
know
you
knew
him
then
did
he
never
whatever
lucia
was
going
to
say
she
thought
better
of
it
she
did
not
see
him
till
the
next
night
after
dinner
when
he
came
to
her
as
she
was
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
back
alone
and
as
he
came
she
looked
at
him
with
a
curiously
intent
yet
baffled
gaze
as
if
trying
to
fit
a
present
impression
to
one
past
and
yet
she
could
hardly
have
had
any
difficulty
in
recognizing
him
for
his
face
was
unforgettable
unique
but
she
missed
something
in
it
which
used
to
be
familiar
and
now
she
saw
that
what
she
had
missed
was
the
restless
look
of
youth
the
sensuous
eagerness
that
had
helped
to
make
it
so
irregular
it
had
settled
into
the
other
look
that
she
had
found
there
more
rarely
the
look
that
strengthened
and
refined
the
mobile
features
and
brought
them
into
harmony
with
the
clean
prominent
lines
of
the
chin
and
of
the
serious
level
brows
of
all
his
looks
it
was
the
one
that
she
used
to
like
best
so
you
come
back
again
he
said
but
i
never
was
away
i
thought
you
were
abroad
who
told
you
that
i
do
know
i
suppose
i
must
have
dreamt
it
i
think
you
must
i
been
in
town
for
the
last
six
weeks
in
town
yes
if
hampstead
town
i
been
staying
with
the
jewdwines
did
he
tell
you
no
he
never
told
me
anything
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
so
why
you
never
came
to
see
me
to
see
you
i
did
know
and
if
i
had
i
should
have
thought
he
hesitated
of
what
of
coming
to
see
me
no
that
you
would
have
cared
for
me
to
come
i
think
that
not
a
thing
you
ought
to
say
of
course
i
cared
well
but
i
could
take
that
for
granted
could
i
could
you
not
after
the
messages
i
sent
you
but
i
never
got
any
messages
did
you
her
upper
lip
quivered
it
was
as
if
she
winced
at
some
thought
that
struck
her
like
a
blow
then
my
cousin
must
have
forgotten
to
give
them
to
you
just
like
him
he
is
shockingly
careless
now
rickman
knew
it
was
not
just
like
him
jewdwine
was
not
careless
he
was
in
all
things
painfully
meticulous
and
he
never
forgot
i
do
think
i
can
forgive
him
for
that
you
must
forgive
him
he
is
overwhelmed
with
work
and
he
really
as
thoughtless
as
you
might
suppose
he
has
given
me
news
of
you
regularly
you
ca
think
how
glad
i
was
to
hear
you
were
getting
on
so
well
as
for
the
latest
news
of
all
she
lifted
her
face
and
looked
at
him
with
her
sweet
kind
eyes
it
true
that
you
are
going
to
be
married
quite
true
i
was
so
glad
to
hear
that
too
thanks
there
was
a
slight
spasm
in
his
throat
that
thick
difficult
word
stuck
in
it
and
choked
him
for
the
moment
i
hope
i
shall
meet
your
wife
some
day
you
have
met
her
lucia
looked
puzzled
and
he
smiled
a
little
sadly
for
a
bridegroom
you
sat
next
her
at
dinner
she
here
somewhere
lucia
turned
her
head
to
where
flossie
was
sitting
by
a
table
sitting
very
upright
with
her
little
air
of
strained
propriety
is
it
is
it
that
pretty
lady
do
you
think
i
might
go
up
and
speak
to
her
i
would
so
like
to
know
her
i
bring
her
to
you
there
rather
a
crowd
just
now
in
the
other
room
he
went
to
her
hardly
knowing
how
he
went
flossie
he
said
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
miss
harden
flossie
eyes
brightened
with
surprise
and
pleasure
for
she
had
learnt
from
downey
that
the
visitor
was
the
daughter
of
sir
frederick
harden
and
lucia
distinction
subdued
her
from
afar
keith
being
aware
of
nothing
but
lucia
failed
to
perceive
as
he
otherwise
might
have
done
that
he
had
risen
in
flossie
opinion
by
his
evident
intimacy
with
miss
harden
she
came
blushing
and
smiling
and
a
little
awkward
steered
by
keith
but
for
all
her
awkwardness
she
had
never
looked
prettier
than
at
that
moment
of
her
approach
if
keith
had
wanted
to
know
precisely
where
he
stood
in
the
order
of
lucia
intimacies
he
might
have
learnt
it
from
her
reception
of
miss
walker
by
it
he
might
have
measured
too
the
height
of
her
belief
in
him
the
depth
of
her
ignorance
she
who
had
divined
him
was
ready
to
take
his
unknown
betrothed
on
trust
to
credit
her
not
with
vast
intellect
perhaps
what
did
that
matter
but
certainly
with
some
rare
and
lovely
quality
of
soul
he
loved
her
that
was
enough
lucia
deduced
the
quality
from
the
love
not
the
love
from
the
quality
his
pretty
lady
must
be
lovable
since
he
loved
her
he
had
noticed
long
ago
that
lucia
face
had
a
way
of
growing
more
beautiful
in
the
act
of
admiration
as
if
it
actually
absorbed
the
loveliness
it
loved
to
look
upon
and
now
as
she
made
a
place
for
flossie
at
her
side
it
wore
that
look
of
wonder
ardent
yet
restrained
that
look
of
shy
and
tentative
delight
with
which
five
years
ago
she
had
approached
his
it
was
as
if
she
had
said
to
herself
he
always
brought
his
best
to
show
me
five
years
ago
he
brought
me
his
dream
to
read
and
care
for
now
he
brings
me
the
real
thing
to
read
and
care
for
too
she
was
evidently
preparing
to
read
flossie
as
if
she
had
been
a
new
and
beautiful
poem
he
was
unaware
of
all
this
unaware
of
everything
except
the
mingled
beatitude
and
torture
of
the
moment
he
sat
leaning
forward
staring
over
his
clasped
hands
at
lucia
feet
where
he
longed
to
fall
down
and
worship
he
heard
her
telling
flossie
how
glad
she
was
to
meet
her
how
unexpected
was
her
finding
of
him
here
after
fire
years
how
five
years
ago
she
had
known
him
in
devonshire
and
so
on
but
in
his
ears
the
music
of
her
voice
detached
itself
wholly
from
the
meaning
of
her
words
thus
he
missed
the
assurance
which
if
he
had
only
listened
intelligently
they
might
have
had
for
him
the
assurance
of
an
indestructible
friendship
that
welcomed
and
enfolded
his
pretty
lady
for
his
sake
but
whatever
her
almost
joyous
acceptance
of
the
pretty
lady
promised
for
the
future
it
could
not
be
said
that
conversationally
lucia
was
getting
on
very
fast
with
flossie
in
the
present
and
abstraction
did
not
make
things
easier
therefore
she
was
a
little
relieved
when
miss
roots
joined
them
and
rickman
startled
into
consciousness
got
up
and
left
the
room
he
feared
that
sympathy
and
shrewdness
nothing
could
be
hidden
from
her
clever
eyes
and
now
perceiving
that
the
conversation
flagged
miss
roots
endeavoured
to
support
it
have
you
seen
she
asked
in
her
tired
voice
lucia
shook
her
head
i
do
know
that
i
want
to
see
it
you
better
not
say
so
before
miss
walker
oh
never
mind
me
said
miss
walker
i
have
been
yet
is
it
good
some
people
seem
to
think
so
it
depends
yes
there
such
a
difference
in
the
way
they
put
them
on
the
stage
too
miss
roots
face
relaxed
and
her
fatigued
intelligence
awoke
who
on
in
it
asked
flossie
happy
and
unconscious
and
the
spirit
of
mischief
seized
upon
miss
roots
i
ca
tell
you
i
not
well
posted
in
these
things
but
i
think
you
better
not
ask
rickman
to
take
you
to
see
flossie
was
mystified
and
a
little
indignant
if
the
play
was
so
improper
why
had
miss
roots
taken
for
granted
that
she
had
seen
it
that
was
at
all
nice
of
her
was
it
said
lucia
smiling
as
miss
roots
went
away
her
look
was
a
healing
touch
laid
on
wounded
vanity
that
the
sort
of
little
trap
she
used
to
lay
for
me
i
suppose
you
mean
she
was
rotting
me
i
always
know
when
other
people
are
rotting
but
that
the
worst
of
her
you
never
can
tell
and
she
makes
you
look
so
ignorant
does
she
she
makes
me
ignorant
but
that
another
thing
but
whatever
did
she
mean
just
now
just
now
she
meant
that
you
knew
all
about
why
should
i
do
know
anything
about
it
not
much
though
it
is
my
cousin
paper
but
as
rickman
writes
for
it
you
see
well
how
was
i
to
know
that
he
always
writing
for
something
and
he
never
think
of
coming
to
every
time
i
never
talk
shop
to
him
and
he
never
talks
shop
to
me
of
course
he
told
me
that
he
got
on
to
some
better
paying
thing
she
added
anxious
to
show
that
she
was
not
shut
out
from
the
secrets
of
his
heart
but
when
you
said
i
did
take
it
in
lucia
made
no
further
attempt
to
converse
she
said
and
followed
sophie
roots
to
her
tiny
room
that
was
rather
dreadful
she
said
to
herself
i
wonder
but
if
she
did
not
linger
long
over
her
wondering
neither
did
she
stop
to
find
out
why
she
was
so
passionately
anxious
to
think
well
of
the
woman
who
was
to
be
keith
rickman
wife
and
why
it
was
such
a
relief
to
her
to
be
angry
with
sophie
for
teasing
the
poor
child
chapter
lv
he
asked
himself
how
it
was
that
he
had
had
no
premonition
of
the
thing
that
was
about
to
happen
to
him
that
the
supreme
moment
should
have
come
upon
him
so
casually
and
with
so
light
a
step
that
he
went
to
meet
it
in
a
mood
so
commonplace
and
unprepared
good
heavens
he
remembered
that
he
had
been
eating
pea
soup
at
the
time
and
wishing
it
were
artichoke
had
he
not
known
that
she
would
come
back
again
and
in
just
that
way
had
he
not
looked
for
her
coming
five
years
ago
and
what
were
five
years
after
all
how
was
it
that
he
had
heard
no
summons
of
the
golden
and
reverberant
hour
and
what
was
he
going
to
do
with
it
or
it
with
him
now
that
it
had
come
that
was
a
question
that
he
preferred
to
leave
unanswered
for
the
present
it
seemed
that
lucia
was
going
to
stay
for
a
week
as
miss
guest
and
it
was
downey
hope
that
she
would
be
with
them
for
a
much
longer
period
on
her
own
account
this
hope
rickman
judged
to
be
altogether
baseless
she
would
never
be
able
to
bear
the
place
for
more
than
a
week
he
inquired
of
miss
roots
early
the
next
morning
on
this
subject
and
at
the
same
time
he
found
out
from
her
what
lucia
had
been
doing
in
the
last
five
years
she
had
not
been
as
jewdwine
had
allowed
him
to
suppose
abroad
all
the
time
with
kitty
palliser
she
had
only
lived
with
miss
palliser
in
the
holidays
the
rest
of
the
year
of
the
five
years
she
had
been
working
for
her
living
as
music
mistress
in
a
women
college
somewhere
in
the
south
of
england
to
his
gesture
of
horror
miss
roots
replied
that
this
was
by
no
means
the
hideous
destiny
he
conceived
it
to
be
but
for
he
exclaimed
and
why
not
for
her
miss
roots
retorted
stung
by
his
undisguised
repugnance
if
lucia
got
her
post
merely
by
interest
which
miss
roots
seemed
to
consider
as
something
of
a
blot
on
her
career
at
the
end
of
her
first
year
she
had
the
pick
of
the
students
waiting
for
her
unfortunately
lucia
had
never
been
strong
and
this
summer
her
health
had
completely
broken
down
at
that
he
shuddered
and
turned
abruptly
away
miss
roots
looked
at
him
and
wondered
why
when
he
approached
her
again
it
was
to
offer
her
with
every
delicacy
and
hesitation
the
loan
of
his
study
for
the
time
of
miss
harden
visit
this
was
not
an
easy
thing
to
do
but
he
was
helped
by
several
inspirations
the
room
he
said
was
simply
standing
empty
all
day
he
had
hardly
any
use
for
it
now
he
would
be
kept
busy
at
the
office
up
to
the
time
of
his
marriage
and
he
thought
it
would
be
a
little
more
comfortable
for
miss
harden
than
the
public
i
want
he
said
lying
with
a
certain
splendour
to
pay
some
attention
to
her
you
see
she
my
editor
cousin
miss
roots
turned
on
him
a
large
look
that
took
him
in
his
monstrous
mendacity
and
all
but
she
nodded
as
much
as
to
say
that
the
explanation
passed
one
hardly
likes
to
think
of
her
you
know
sitting
in
the
same
room
with
soper
we
all
have
to
put
up
with
mr
soper
yes
but
if
she
is
strong
she
ought
to
have
some
place
where
she
can
be
alone
and
rest
besides
it
be
nicer
for
you
see
a
great
deal
more
of
her
you
know
that
way
in
the
end
the
offer
was
accepted
for
as
miss
roots
pointed
out
to
her
friend
it
would
give
him
far
more
pleasure
to
lend
his
room
than
to
sit
in
it
himself
certainly
it
gave
him
pleasure
a
thrilling
subtle
and
perfidious
pleasure
every
time
that
he
thought
of
lucia
occupying
his
room
but
before
she
could
be
allowed
to
enter
he
caused
it
to
be
thoroughly
cleansed
and
purified
as
far
as
possible
from
the
tobacco
smoke
that
lingered
in
the
curtains
and
the
armchairs
he
tidied
it
up
with
his
own
hands
removing
or
concealing
the
unlovelier
signs
of
his
presence
and
profession
he
bought
several
cushions
silk
and
down
for
the
sofa
and
a
curtain
for
the
door
to
keep
out
the
draught
and
a
soft
rug
for
lucia
feet
also
a
a
brass
kettle
and
a
spirit
lamp
and
flowers
in
an
expensive
pot
he
did
things
to
them
to
make
them
look
as
if
they
had
been
some
little
time
in
use
he
caused
a
wrinkle
to
appear
in
the
smooth
blue
cheeks
of
the
sofa
cushions
he
rubbed
some
of
the
youth
off
the
edges
of
the
he
made
the
brass
kettle
dance
lightly
on
the
floor
until
without
injury
to
its
essential
beauty
it
had
acquired
a
look
of
experience
it
was
the
deceit
involved
in
these
proceedings
that
gave
him
the
first
clear
consciousness
of
guilt
he
persuaded
himself
that
all
these
articles
would
come
in
nicely
for
the
little
house
at
ealing
then
remembered
that
he
had
provided
most
of
them
already
in
doubt
as
to
the
propriety
of
these
preparations
he
again
approached
miss
roots
i
say
said
he
you
need
tell
her
all
these
things
are
mine
i
going
to
leave
them
here
in
case
she
wants
to
stay
on
afterwards
she
wo
have
to
pay
so
much
then
you
know
he
hesitated
do
you
think
that
a
thing
that
can
be
done
oh
yes
it
can
be
done
she
replied
with
an
unmistakable
emphasis
but
i
may
do
it
may
i
it
all
right
if
she
does
know
you
know
miss
roots
said
nothing
but
he
gathered
that
she
would
not
betray
him
that
she
understood
he
could
not
explain
matters
half
so
clearly
to
himself
he
might
have
wanted
to
lend
his
study
to
his
friend
cousin
he
certainly
did
want
to
lend
it
to
lucia
for
her
own
sake
but
besides
these
very
proper
and
natural
desires
he
had
other
motives
which
would
not
bear
too
strict
examination
lucia
sitting
in
the
same
room
with
soper
was
not
a
spectacle
that
could
be
calmly
contemplated
but
he
hoped
that
by
providing
her
with
a
refuge
from
mr
soper
he
might
induce
her
to
stay
till
the
moment
of
his
own
departure
and
there
was
another
selfish
consideration
it
was
impossible
to
see
her
to
talk
to
her
with
any
pleasure
in
the
public
lucia
could
not
come
into
his
study
as
long
as
it
was
his
but
if
he
gave
it
up
to
her
and
her
friend
it
was
just
possible
that
he
might
be
permitted
to
call
on
her
there
that
she
accepted
him
as
a
friend
he
could
not
any
longer
doubt
there
were
so
many
things
that
he
had
to
say
to
her
such
long
arrears
of
explanation
and
understanding
to
make
up
he
could
see
that
unlike
the
lucia
he
used
to
know
she
had
misunderstood
him
indeed
she
had
owned
as
much
and
for
this
he
had
to
thank
horace
jewdwine
jewdwine
behaviour
gave
him
much
matter
for
reflection
painful
but
instructive
jewdwine
had
not
lied
to
him
about
lucia
movements
but
he
had
allowed
him
to
remain
in
error
he
had
kept
his
cousin
regularly
posted
in
the
news
she
had
asked
for
as
concerning
an
unfortunate
young
man
in
whom
they
were
both
interested
but
he
had
contrived
that
no
sign
of
her
solicitude
should
reach
the
object
of
it
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
merely
anxious
to
render
an
account
of
his
stewardship
to
assure
her
that
the
unfortunate
young
man
was
now
prospering
under
his
protection
was
indeed
doing
so
well
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
lucia
to
worry
herself
about
him
any
more
apparently
he
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
admit
that
there
was
friendship
between
rickman
and
himself
while
taking
care
that
there
should
never
be
anything
of
the
sort
between
rickman
and
lucia
he
had
constituted
himself
a
way
by
which
news
of
rickman
might
reach
lucia
but
he
had
sternly
closed
every
path
from
lucia
to
rickman
that
meant
that
lucia
might
be
depended
upon
but
that
rickman
must
be
allowed
no
footing
lest
he
should
advance
too
far
in
other
words
it
meant
that
they
acknowledged
and
always
would
acknowledge
the
genius
while
they
judged
it
expedient
to
ignore
the
man
but
had
not
always
ignored
him
did
it
not
rather
mean
then
that
jewdwine
would
not
trust
her
there
that
knowing
her
nature
and
how
defenceless
it
lay
before
the
impulses
of
its
own
kindness
he
feared
for
her
any
personal
communication
with
his
friend
it
did
not
occur
to
rickman
that
what
jewdwine
dreaded
more
than
anything
for
lucia
was
the
influence
of
a
unique
and
irresistible
personal
charm
as
far
as
he
could
see
jewdwine
was
merely
desperately
anxious
to
protect
his
kinswoman
from
what
he
considered
an
undesirable
acquaintance
and
five
years
ago
his
fears
and
his
behaviour
would
have
been
justifiable
for
rickman
owned
that
at
that
period
he
had
not
been
fit
to
sit
in
the
same
room
with
lucia
harden
far
less
if
it
came
to
that
than
poor
soper
but
his
life
since
he
had
known
her
was
judged
even
by
jewdwine
to
be
irreproachable
as
rickman
understood
the
situation
he
had
been
sacrificed
to
a
prejudice
a
convention
an
ineradicable
on
the
part
of
the
distinguished
and
fastidious
don
it
was
not
the
itself
that
he
resented
he
could
have
forgiven
jewdwine
a
sentiment
over
which
he
had
apparently
no
control
he
could
have
forgiven
him
anything
even
his
silence
and
his
subterfuge
if
he
had
only
delivered
lucia
messages
that
was
an
unpardonable
cruelty
it
was
like
holding
back
a
cup
of
water
from
a
man
dying
of
thirst
he
had
consumed
his
heart
with
longing
for
some
word
or
sign
from
her
he
had
tortured
himself
with
his
belief
in
her
utter
repudiation
of
him
and
jewdwine
who
had
proof
of
the
contrary
had
abandoned
him
to
his
belief
he
could
only
think
that
after
taking
him
up
so
gently
lucia
had
dropped
him
and
left
him
where
he
fell
he
owned
that
jewdwine
was
not
bound
to
tell
him
that
lucia
had
returned
to
england
or
to
provide
against
any
false
impression
he
might
form
as
to
her
whereabouts
and
it
was
not
there
of
course
that
the
cruelty
came
in
he
could
have
borne
the
sense
of
physical
separation
if
instead
of
being
forced
to
infer
her
indifference
from
her
silence
he
had
known
that
her
kind
thoughts
had
returned
to
him
continually
if
he
had
known
that
whatever
else
had
been
taken
from
him
he
had
kept
her
friendship
her
friendship
it
was
little
enough
compared
with
what
he
wanted
but
it
had
already
done
so
much
for
him
that
he
knew
what
he
could
have
made
of
it
if
he
had
only
been
certain
that
it
was
his
he
could
have
lived
those
five
years
on
the
memory
of
her
as
other
men
live
on
hope
sustained
by
the
intangible
but
radiant
presence
by
inimitable
incommunicable
ardours
by
immaterial
satisfactions
and
delights
if
they
had
not
destroyed
all
bodily
longing
they
would
at
least
have
made
impossible
its
separation
from
her
and
transference
to
another
woman
they
would
have
saved
him
from
this
base
concession
to
the
folly
of
the
flesh
this
marriage
which
as
its
hour
approached
seemed
to
him
more
inevitable
and
more
disastrous
madness
lay
in
the
thought
that
his
deliverance
had
been
near
him
on
the
very
day
when
he
fixed
that
hour
and
that
at
no
time
had
it
been
very
far
away
no
not
when
two
years
ago
he
had
stood
hesitating
on
the
edge
of
the
inexpiable
immeasurable
folly
the
folly
that
had
received
engulfed
him
now
beyond
deliverance
and
return
if
only
he
had
known
if
he
could
have
been
sure
of
her
friendship
if
he
could
have
seen
her
for
one
moment
in
many
months
one
hour
in
many
years
the
thing
would
never
have
begun
or
being
begun
could
never
have
been
carried
through
meanwhile
the
friendship
remained
his
being
married
could
not
make
it
less
and
his
being
unmarried
would
certainly
not
have
made
it
more
as
there
could
be
neither
more
nor
less
of
it
he
ought
to
have
been
able
to
regard
it
as
a
simple
definite
solidly
satisfactory
thing
but
he
had
no
sooner
realized
that
so
much
at
least
was
his
than
he
perceived
that
he
had
only
the
very
vaguest
notion
as
to
the
nature
and
extent
of
it
of
all
human
relations
friendship
was
the
obscurest
the
most
uncertainly
defined
at
this
point
he
remembered
one
fatal
thing
about
her
it
had
always
been
her
nature
to
give
pleasure
and
be
kind
the
passion
he
imagined
was
indestructible
and
with
a
temperament
like
that
she
might
be
ten
times
his
friend
without
his
knowing
from
one
day
to
another
how
he
really
stood
with
her
and
hitherto
one
means
of
judging
had
been
altogether
denied
to
him
he
had
never
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
her
ways
with
other
men
this
third
evening
he
watched
her
jealously
testing
her
dealings
with
him
by
her
behaviour
to
the
boarders
and
notably
to
spinks
and
soper
for
lucia
whether
she
was
afraid
of
hurting
the
feelings
of
these
people
or
whether
she
hesitated
to
establish
herself
altogether
in
rickman
study
had
determined
to
spend
the
first
hours
after
dinner
in
the
miss
roots
protested
against
these
weak
concessions
to
the
social
order
you
never
be
able
to
stand
them
dear
she
said
they
terrible
but
lucia
had
her
way
you
stood
them
for
five
years
said
she
yes
but
i
had
my
work
and
i
used
to
it
and
in
any
case
not
miss
lucia
harden
rickman
stands
them
does
he
you
would
say
so
if
you
known
him
for
five
years
i
wonder
why
he
stayed
do
you
perhaps
miss
flossie
could
enlighten
you
of
course
i
was
forgetting
her
do
forget
her
said
miss
roots
drily
she
important
miss
roots
went
up
to
the
study
and
lucia
turned
into
the
she
owned
to
herself
that
what
took
her
there
was
not
so
much
an
impulse
of
politeness
as
an
irresistible
desire
to
know
what
manner
of
people
keith
rickman
had
had
to
live
among
in
those
evenings
the
scene
had
grown
familiar
to
her
the
long
room
with
the
three
tall
windows
looking
on
the
street
the
nottingham
lace
curtains
tied
with
yellow
sashes
in
the
middle
the
vivid
painting
of
the
a
bad
match
for
the
wall
paper
the
oleographs
and
in
their
gilded
frames
the
carpet
with
its
monstrous
meaningless
design
in
brown
and
amber
the
table
secretary
and
cabinet
of
walnut
wood
whose
markings
simulated
some
horrible
discoloration
of
decay
the
base
company
of
chairs
and
the
villainous
little
maroon
velvet
ottoman
worn
by
the
backs
of
many
boarders
and
beyond
the
folding
doors
the
dim
little
chamber
looking
on
a
mews
and
the
boarders
growing
familiar
too
to
her
sensitive
impressionable
brain
miss
bramble
upright
in
her
morning
gown
and
poor
little
lace
cap
and
collar
downey
sitting
flushed
and
weary
in
the
most
remote
and
most
uncomfortable
chair
spinks
reading
the
paper
with
an
air
of
a
man
engaged
in
profound
literary
research
the
two
girls
sitting
together
on
the
ottoman
under
the
gaselier
soper
wandering
uneasily
among
them
with
his
insignificant
smile
and
his
offerings
of
and
keith
rickman
sitting
apart
staring
at
his
hands
or
looking
at
flossie
with
his
blue
profoundly
pathetic
eyes
for
that
pretty
lady
sake
how
he
must
have
suffered
in
those
five
years
rickman
from
his
retreat
in
the
back
watched
her
ways
she
was
kind
to
miss
bramble
she
was
kind
to
that
old
ruffian
partridge
whose
neck
he
would
willingly
have
wrung
she
was
kind
good
heavens
yes
she
was
kind
to
soper
when
the
commercial
gentleman
approached
her
with
his
infernal
box
of
she
took
one
he
could
have
murdered
soper
he
was
profoundly
depressed
by
the
spectacle
of
lucia
ways
if
she
behaved
like
that
to
every
one
what
had
he
to
go
upon
nothing
nothing
it
was
just
her
way
and
yet
he
did
not
exactly
see
her
sending
messages
to
soper
he
rose
and
opened
the
grand
piano
that
stood
in
the
back
he
went
up
to
her
meeting
with
a
nervous
smile
flossie
inquiring
look
as
he
passed
he
stood
a
moment
with
one
arm
on
the
and
waited
looking
down
at
lucia
presently
she
raised
her
head
and
smiled
as
surely
she
could
never
have
smiled
at
soper
do
you
want
me
to
play
for
you
she
said
that
is
exactly
what
i
wanted
he
drew
the
flattering
inference
that
while
apparently
absorbed
in
conversation
with
miss
bramble
she
had
been
aware
of
his
presence
in
the
background
and
of
every
movement
he
had
made
well
i
must
ask
our
hostess
first
must
i
she
went
to
that
lady
and
bent
over
her
with
her
request
if
lucia
aim
was
to
give
pleasure
she
had
certainly
achieved
it
downey
may
or
may
not
have
loved
music
but
she
was
visibly
excited
at
the
prospect
of
hearing
it
so
were
the
boarders
they
settled
themselves
solemnly
in
their
seats
spinks
crushed
his
noisy
newspaper
into
a
ball
and
thrust
it
behind
him
miss
bramble
put
away
her
clicking
needles
while
soper
let
himself
sink
into
a
chair
with
elaborate
silence
one
and
all
with
the
exception
of
partridge
who
slept
they
turned
their
faces
politely
expectant
towards
the
inner
room
it
struck
lucia
that
in
this
the
poor
things
were
better
mannered
than
many
a
more
aristocratic
audience
rickman
lit
the
candles
on
the
piano
and
seated
himself
beside
her
i
know
what
i
have
got
to
play
said
she
what
the
sonata
appassionata
is
it
fancy
your
remembering
of
course
i
remember
it
is
every
one
who
cares
for
beethoven
afraid
the
others
wo
like
it
though
they
got
to
like
it
he
said
doggedly
and
lucia
with
her
fatal
passion
for
giving
pleasure
played
and
as
the
stream
of
music
flowed
through
the
room
it
swept
away
all
sense
of
his
surroundings
all
memory
of
the
love
and
truth
and
honour
pledged
to
his
betrothed
and
every
little
scruple
of
pity
or
of
conscience
it
bore
down
upon
the
barriers
that
stood
between
him
and
lucia
and
swept
them
away
too
and
the
secret
sources
of
his
inspiration
sealed
for
so
many
months
were
opened
and
flowed
with
the
flowing
of
the
stream
and
over
them
the
deep
flood
of
his
longing
and
his
misery
rose
and
broke
and
mingled
with
the
tumult
and
through
it
and
high
above
it
all
it
was
as
if
his
soul
made
music
with
her
turning
the
sonata
appassionata
into
a
singing
of
many
voices
a
symphony
of
many
strings
so
lost
was
he
that
he
failed
to
perceive
the
effect
of
her
playing
on
the
audience
of
the
outer
room
flossie
sat
there
very
quiet
in
her
awe
miss
bishop
kept
her
loose
mouth
open
drinking
in
the
sounds
soper
leaned
forward
breathing
heavily
in
a
stupid
wonder
there
over
the
tops
of
the
chairs
one
ribbon
on
miss
cap
seemed
to
be
beating
time
to
the
music
all
by
itself
while
downey
flushed
and
swelled
with
pride
at
the
astonishing
capabilities
of
her
piano
he
did
not
notice
either
that
as
lucia
played
the
tender
opening
bars
of
the
sonata
partridge
shook
off
the
slumber
that
bound
him
at
this
hour
that
as
she
struck
the
thundering
chords
that
signal
the
presto
finale
he
raised
his
head
like
an
old
at
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
he
stared
solemnly
at
lucia
as
she
came
forward
followed
by
rickman
then
he
rose
from
his
own
consecrated
chair
heavily
but
with
a
certain
dignity
suited
to
the
moral
grandeur
of
the
act
and
made
a
gesture
of
abdication
i
was
a
professional
myself
once
said
he
my
instrument
was
the
flute
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
spirit
of
lucia
reception
that
night
perhaps
the
finest
appreciation
of
connoisseurs
had
never
touched
her
more
than
did
the
praise
of
that
simple
audience
rickman
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
thank
her
for
when
her
playing
was
over
he
had
turned
suddenly
very
cold
seized
with
a
fierce
shivering
the
reaction
from
the
tense
fever
of
his
nerves
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
controlled
the
chattering
of
his
teeth
but
before
they
parted
for
the
night
he
asked
if
he
might
call
some
afternoon
his
tone
pointing
the
allusion
to
the
arrangement
that
permitted
this
approach
we
ca
talk
very
well
here
can
we
he
said
she
answered
by
inviting
him
and
miss
walker
to
tea
the
next
day
he
was
conscious
of
a
base
inward
exultation
when
he
heard
poor
flossie
say
that
she
could
only
look
in
later
for
a
little
while
in
october
work
was
heavy
at
the
bank
and
the
beaver
seldom
got
home
till
after
his
conscience
asked
him
sternly
if
he
had
reckoned
on
that
too
when
came
miss
hoots
was
busy
also
and
disappeared
after
tea
he
had
certainly
reckoned
on
that
disappearance
there
was
a
moment
of
embarrassment
on
his
part
when
he
found
himself
alone
with
lucia
in
the
room
his
room
that
he
had
made
ready
for
her
he
had
done
his
work
so
thoroughly
well
that
the
place
looked
as
if
it
had
been
ready
for
her
since
the
beginning
of
time
she
was
tired
he
remembered
how
tired
she
used
to
be
at
harmouth
and
he
noticed
with
a
pang
how
little
it
took
to
tire
her
now
she
leaned
back
in
his
chair
propped
by
the
cushions
he
had
chosen
for
her
chosen
with
a
distinct
prevision
of
the
beauty
of
the
white
face
and
dark
hair
against
that
particular
shade
of
greenish
blue
she
had
been
reading
one
of
his
books
it
lay
in
her
lap
her
feet
rested
on
his
fender
they
stretched
out
towards
the
warmth
of
his
fire
if
only
it
were
permitted
to
him
always
to
buy
things
for
her
always
to
give
her
the
rest
she
needed
always
to
care
for
her
and
keep
her
warm
and
well
he
wondered
how
things
had
gone
with
her
those
five
years
had
she
been
happy
in
that
college
in
the
south
had
they
been
kind
to
her
those
women
or
had
they
tortured
her
as
only
women
can
torture
women
in
some
devilish
subtle
way
or
would
overwork
account
for
the
failure
of
her
strength
he
thought
he
saw
signs
in
her
tender
face
of
some
obscure
suffering
of
the
delicate
nerves
well
anyhow
she
was
resting
now
and
in
looking
at
her
he
rested
too
from
the
labour
of
conscience
and
the
trouble
of
desire
heart
and
senses
were
made
quiet
by
her
mere
presence
if
his
hands
trembled
as
they
waited
on
her
it
was
not
with
passion
but
with
some
new
feeling
indescribable
and
profound
for
brought
so
near
to
him
as
this
so
near
as
to
create
the
illusion
of
possession
she
became
for
him
something
too
sacred
for
his
hands
to
touch
he
could
count
on
about
half
an
hour
of
this
illusion
before
flossie
appeared
afraid
of
losing
one
moment
of
it
he
began
instantly
on
the
thing
he
had
to
say
all
this
time
i
been
waiting
to
thank
you
for
your
introduction
to
fielding
oh
she
said
eagerly
what
did
he
say
tell
me
he
told
her
as
she
listened
he
could
see
how
small
a
pleasure
was
enough
to
give
life
again
to
her
tired
face
i
am
so
glad
she
said
in
the
low
voice
of
sincerity
so
very
glad
she
paused
that
justifies
my
belief
in
you
not
that
it
needed
any
justification
i
do
know
your
cousin
who
is
the
best
critic
i
know
would
tell
you
that
it
did
my
cousin
perhaps
but
he
see
that
those
poems
are
great
only
he
so
made
that
i
think
no
greatness
reconciles
him
to
well
to
little
faults
if
they
are
faults
of
taste
did
you
find
many
faults
of
taste
she
smiled
i
found
some
but
only
in
the
younger
poems
there
were
none
none
at
all
in
the
later
ones
which
of
course
is
what
one
might
expect
it
is
indeed
did
you
look
at
the
dates
did
you
notice
that
all
those
later
things
were
written
either
at
harmouth
or
after
i
did
and
did
that
strike
you
as
significant
did
you
draw
any
conclusions
i
drew
the
conclusion
that
that
the
poet
i
knew
had
worked
out
his
own
salvation
exactly
the
poet
you
knew
did
it
occur
to
you
that
he
might
never
have
done
it
if
you
had
known
him
he
looked
at
her
steadily
the
colour
on
her
face
had
deepened
but
her
eyes
as
they
met
his
were
grave
and
meditative
she
seemed
to
be
considering
the
precise
meaning
of
his
words
before
she
answered
no
i
did
what
never
think
do
you
remember
how
you
used
to
help
me
she
shook
her
head
i
only
remember
that
i
meant
to
have
helped
you
and
i
was
very
sorry
because
i
could
but
i
see
now
how
absurd
it
was
of
me
and
how
unnecessary
he
knew
that
she
was
thinking
now
of
her
private
secretary
it
was
beautiful
of
you
but
you
know
it
could
have
happened
it
was
one
of
those
beautiful
things
that
never
can
happen
that
why
i
was
so
sorry
i
thought
it
must
look
as
if
i
meant
it
but
you
did
mean
it
nothing
can
alter
that
can
it
no
you
must
take
the
will
for
the
deed
i
do
the
will
is
the
only
thing
that
matters
yes
but
it
was
absurd
of
me
but
i
thought
you
might
have
been
counting
on
it
did
i
count
on
it
i
suppose
i
did
though
i
knew
it
was
impossible
you
forget
that
i
knew
all
the
time
it
was
impossible
it
was
only
a
beautiful
idea
i
sorry
then
that
it
had
to
remain
an
idea
do
be
sorry
perhaps
that
the
only
way
it
could
remain
beautiful
it
would
have
done
you
know
you
only
thought
it
could
because
you
were
so
kind
it
was
all
very
well
for
me
to
work
for
you
for
three
weeks
or
so
it
would
have
been
very
different
when
you
had
me
on
your
hands
for
a
whole
year
at
a
stretch
and
it
much
better
for
me
that
it
never
came
off
than
if
i
had
to
see
you
sorry
for
it
afterwards
if
i
had
been
sorry
i
should
not
have
let
you
see
it
i
should
have
seen
it
though
whether
you
let
me
or
not
i
always
see
these
things
but
i
think
you
know
that
i
would
have
been
sorry
you
would
you
would
you
could
have
stood
me
i
think
i
could
what
a
person
with
a
villainous
cockney
accent
who
was
capable
of
murdering
the
queen
english
any
day
in
your
oh
no
whatever
you
do
you
never
do
that
well
i
do
know
i
not
really
to
be
trusted
unless
i
got
a
pen
in
my
hand
i
better
than
i
used
to
be
i
struggled
against
it
still
a
man
who
has
once
murdered
the
queen
english
always
feels
you
know
as
if
he
got
the
body
under
the
sofa
it
like
homicidal
mania
the
poor
wretch
may
be
cured
but
he
lives
in
terror
of
an
attack
returning
he
knows
it
does
matter
what
he
is
or
what
he
does
he
may
live
like
a
saint
or
write
like
an
archangel
but
one
aitch
omitted
from
his
conversation
will
wreck
him
at
the
last
you
need
be
afraid
you
never
omit
them
you
mean
i
never
omit
them
now
but
i
did
five
years
ago
i
help
it
everybody
about
me
did
it
the
only
difference
between
them
and
me
was
that
i
knew
it
and
they
did
you
conscious
of
it
then
conscious
do
you
know
that
for
every
lapse
of
the
sort
in
your
presence
i
suffered
the
torments
of
the
damned
do
you
suppose
i
did
know
how
terrible
i
was
she
shook
her
head
this
time
with
disapproval
you
should
say
these
things
do
you
mean
i
should
say
them
or
should
say
them
to
you
well
i
think
you
should
say
them
to
me
do
you
see
that
it
sounds
as
if
i
had
done
or
said
something
to
make
you
feel
like
that
you
good
heavens
rather
not
but
whatever
you
said
or
did
i
could
help
knowing
how
you
thought
of
me
and
how
was
that
well
as
half
a
poet
you
know
and
half
a
that
funny
but
it
another
of
the
things
you
should
say
because
you
know
it
is
true
i
only
say
them
because
i
want
you
to
see
how
impossible
it
was
for
me
to
help
you
yes
i
do
see
it
it
impossible
but
not
for
any
of
the
reasons
you
suppose
if
it
had
been
possible
what
then
then
perhaps
i
need
have
felt
so
sorry
and
ashamed
you
know
i
really
a
little
bit
ashamed
of
having
asked
a
great
poet
to
be
my
private
secretary
it
was
thus
that
she
extricated
herself
from
the
embarrassing
position
in
which
his
clumsiness
had
placed
her
for
he
saw
what
she
meant
when
she
told
him
that
he
should
not
say
these
things
to
her
he
had
made
her
feel
that
she
ought
to
defend
him
from
the
charges
he
had
brought
against
himself
when
she
knew
them
to
be
true
when
her
gentleness
could
only
have
spared
him
at
the
expense
of
her
sincerity
how
beautifully
she
had
turned
it
off
he
refrained
from
the
obvious
pretty
speeches
his
eyes
had
answered
her
if
you
knew
that
you
done
something
for
me
not
a
little
thing
but
a
great
one
he
paused
and
in
the
silence
they
heard
the
sound
of
flossie
feet
coming
up
the
stair
he
had
only
just
time
to
finish
his
sentence
would
it
please
you
or
annoy
you
she
answered
hurriedly
for
as
she
rose
flossie
was
knocking
at
the
door
it
would
please
me
more
than
i
can
say
then
he
said
in
a
voice
that
was
too
low
for
flossie
to
hear
you
know
it
chapter
lvi
it
was
impossible
that
rickman
intimacy
with
miss
harden
should
pass
unnoticed
by
the
other
boarders
but
it
was
well
understood
by
miss
roots
by
flossie
and
by
all
of
them
that
any
attentions
he
paid
to
her
were
paid
strictly
to
his
editor
cousin
and
if
there
was
the
least
little
shade
of
duplicity
in
this
explanation
his
conscience
held
him
so
far
guiltless
seeing
that
he
had
adopted
it
more
on
lucia
account
than
his
own
incidentally
however
he
was
not
displeased
that
it
had
apparently
satisfied
flossie
but
if
flossie
felt
no
uneasiness
at
the
approaches
of
rickman
and
miss
harden
the
news
that
lucia
was
staying
under
the
same
roof
with
the
impossible
young
poet
could
hardly
be
received
with
complacency
by
her
relations
it
threw
edith
jewdwine
into
an
agony
of
alarm
horace
as
yet
knew
nothing
about
it
for
he
was
abroad
even
edith
had
heard
nothing
until
her
return
from
her
autumn
holiday
in
wales
when
a
letter
from
lucia
informed
her
that
she
would
be
staying
for
the
next
week
or
two
with
sophie
roots
in
tavistock
place
edith
was
utterly
unprepared
for
her
cousin
change
of
plans
she
had
not
asked
lucia
to
go
with
her
to
wales
for
lucia
last
idea
had
been
to
spend
september
and
october
in
devonshire
with
kitty
palliser
edith
eager
for
her
holiday
had
not
stopped
to
see
whether
the
arrangements
with
kitty
were
completed
and
lucia
aware
of
edith
impatience
had
omitted
to
mention
that
they
were
not
but
what
made
lucia
move
so
particularly
trying
to
edith
was
the
circumstance
that
relations
between
them
had
latterly
been
a
little
strained
and
when
edith
searched
her
heart
she
found
that
for
this
unhappy
tension
it
was
she
and
not
lucia
who
had
been
to
blame
and
now
while
lucia
was
resting
calmly
on
rickman
sofa
in
the
grave
and
beautiful
of
the
old
brown
house
at
hampstead
a
refined
and
fastidious
little
lady
walked
up
and
down
in
a
state
of
high
nervous
excitement
that
little
lady
bore
in
her
slight
way
a
remarkable
resemblance
to
her
brother
horace
it
was
horace
in
petticoats
diminutive
and
dark
there
was
the
same
clearness
the
same
distinction
of
feature
the
same
supercilious
forehead
the
same
quivering
of
the
nose
the
same
drooping
of
the
unhappy
mouth
bat
the
flame
of
edith
small
steel
black
eyes
revealed
a
creature
of
more
ardour
and
more
energy
at
the
moment
edith
was
visited
with
severe
compunction
an
intrusive
uncomfortable
feeling
that
she
had
never
before
been
thus
compelled
to
entertain
for
looking
back
upon
the
past
two
years
she
perceived
that
her
conduct
as
mistress
of
that
and
house
had
not
always
been
as
fastidious
and
refined
as
she
could
wish
the
house
and
the
were
mainly
the
cause
of
it
before
horace
became
editor
of
edith
had
been
mistress
of
a
minute
establishment
kept
up
with
difficulty
on
a
narrow
income
in
a
seventeen
feet
by
twelve
she
received
with
difficulty
a
small
circle
of
the
cultured
ladies
as
refined
and
fastidious
as
herself
and
after
superhuman
efforts
on
the
part
of
these
ladies
occasionally
a
preoccupied
and
superlatively
married
man
from
this
position
compatible
with
her
exclusiveness
but
not
with
her
temperament
or
her
ambition
edith
found
herself
raised
suddenly
to
a
perfect
eminence
of
culture
and
refinement
as
head
of
the
great
editor
house
she
held
a
sort
of
salon
to
which
her
brother
reputation
attracted
many
figures
if
possible
more
distinguished
than
his
own
she
found
herself
the
object
of
much
flattering
attention
on
the
part
of
persons
anxious
to
stand
well
with
horace
jewdwine
with
a
dignity
positively
marvellous
in
so
small
a
woman
her
head
held
high
and
made
higher
still
by
the
raised
roll
of
her
black
hair
edith
reigned
for
three
years
in
that
long
she
laid
down
the
law
grandiloquently
to
the
young
aspirants
who
thronged
her
court
she
rewarded
with
superb
compliments
those
who
had
achieved
happily
for
edith
those
gentlemen
were
masters
of
social
legerdemain
and
they
conveyed
their
smiles
up
the
sleeves
of
their
adroitly
unperceived
and
then
in
the
very
flower
of
her
small
dynasty
lucia
came
lucia
with
her
music
and
her
youth
and
her
indestructible
charm
and
the
little
court
fickle
by
its
very
nature
went
over
bodily
to
lucia
to
lucia
who
did
not
want
it
who
would
much
rather
have
been
without
it
but
must
needs
encourage
it
play
to
it
sympathize
with
it
just
to
satisfy
that
instinct
of
hers
which
was
so
fatal
and
so
blind
and
horace
who
to
edith
great
relief
had
freed
himself
from
this
most
undesirable
attachment
who
for
three
years
had
presented
every
appearance
of
judicious
apathy
horace
perceiving
that
men
eyes
and
women
too
loved
to
follow
and
to
rest
upon
his
cousin
discovering
all
over
again
on
his
own
account
the
mysterious
genius
of
her
fascination
had
ended
by
bowing
down
and
worshipping
too
his
adoration
was
the
more
profound
and
in
edith
shrewd
opinion
more
dangerous
because
he
kept
it
to
himself
because
it
pledged
him
to
nothing
in
the
eyes
of
lucia
and
the
world
but
the
eyes
of
the
world
especially
of
the
journalistic
world
are
exceedingly
sharp
and
if
lucia
had
not
been
charming
in
herself
those
literary
ladies
and
gentlemen
would
have
found
her
so
as
the
lady
whom
horace
jewdwine
was
presumably
about
to
marry
it
was
hanson
hanson
of
the
who
sent
the
rumour
round
reine
est
morte
vive
la
the
superb
despotic
edith
saw
herself
not
only
deserted
but
deposed
left
with
neither
court
nor
kingdom
declining
from
the
palace
of
royalty
to
the
cottage
of
the
private
gentlewoman
and
maintaining
her
imperious
refinement
on
a
revenue
absurdly
disproportioned
to
that
end
not
that
as
yet
there
had
been
any
suggestion
of
edith
abdication
as
yet
lucia
had
only
spent
her
winter
holidays
at
hampstead
but
when
at
the
end
of
the
present
summer
lucia
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
broke
down
and
her
salary
ceased
with
her
strength
it
became
a
question
of
providing
her
with
a
home
for
three
months
at
the
very
least
even
then
the
revolution
was
delayed
for
horace
had
gone
abroad
in
the
autumn
but
with
every
month
that
edith
remained
in
power
she
loved
power
more
and
in
her
heart
she
had
been
considering
how
without
scandal
to
the
world
or
annoyance
to
horace
or
offence
to
lucia
she
could
put
her
rival
delicately
aside
she
had
long
been
on
the
for
easy
posts
for
lucia
for
posts
in
rich
and
aristocratic
families
in
the
provinces
or
better
still
for
ladies
in
want
of
charming
travelling
companions
but
now
better
a
thousand
times
better
that
edith
should
have
been
forced
to
abdicate
than
that
lucia
should
have
taken
herself
out
of
the
way
in
this
fashion
a
fashion
so
hideously
suggestive
of
social
suicide
that
she
should
be
living
within
four
miles
of
her
fastidious
and
refined
relations
in
a
inhabitated
by
goodness
knows
whom
if
only
that
had
been
all
of
course
it
was
intolerable
to
think
of
lucia
mixing
with
the
sort
of
people
whom
nobody
but
goodness
ever
does
know
but
after
all
she
would
mix
with
them
she
had
had
time
to
and
if
instantly
removed
from
the
place
of
contamination
she
might
yet
be
presented
to
society
again
without
spot
or
taint
but
it
was
not
all
out
of
the
many
hundred
base
abodes
of
bloomsbury
lucia
had
picked
out
the
one
house
she
ought
to
have
avoided
the
one
address
which
for
five
years
her
cousin
horace
had
been
endeavouring
to
conceal
from
her
it
being
the
address
of
the
one
disreputable
the
one
impossible
person
of
his
acquaintance
rickman
had
appeared
as
strange
people
sometimes
did
at
edith
court
an
appearance
easily
explained
and
justified
by
the
fact
that
he
was
a
genius
of
whom
horace
jewdwine
hoped
great
things
but
he
had
never
been
suffered
in
that
salon
when
lucia
had
been
there
horace
had
taken
untold
pains
he
had
even
lied
frequently
and
elaborately
to
prevent
lucia
encountering
were
it
only
by
accident
that
one
impossible
person
and
here
she
was
living
actually
living
in
the
same
house
with
him
even
if
rickman
could
be
trusted
to
efface
himself
which
was
very
likely
for
if
there
is
anything
more
irrepressible
than
a
cockney
vulgarian
it
is
a
poet
and
rickman
was
both
could
they
could
anybody
trust
lucia
and
her
idiotic
impulse
to
be
kind
to
be
kind
at
any
cost
she
never
calculated
the
cost
of
anything
which
was
another
irritating
reflection
for
miss
jewdwine
poor
as
she
was
she
thought
nothing
of
paying
or
thirty
shillings
for
her
board
and
a
miserable
lodging
when
she
might
she
ought
to
have
been
living
with
her
relations
free
of
all
expense
but
there
was
the
sting
the
unspeakable
sting
for
it
meant
that
lucia
would
do
anything
pay
anything
rather
than
stop
another
week
in
hampstead
and
edith
knew
that
it
was
she
who
had
made
lucia
feel
like
that
she
who
had
driven
her
to
this
deplorable
step
not
by
anything
done
or
said
or
even
implied
but
by
things
not
done
things
not
said
things
darkly
or
passionately
thought
for
lucia
with
her
terrible
gift
of
intuition
must
somehow
have
known
all
the
time
what
edith
hardly
knew
what
at
least
she
would
never
have
recognized
if
she
had
not
observed
the
effect
on
lucia
edith
had
no
patience
with
people
who
were
so
abominably
sensitive
it
was
all
nerves
nerves
nerves
lucia
was
and
always
had
been
hopelessly
neurotic
and
if
people
were
to
be
shaken
and
upset
by
every
passing
current
of
another
person
thought
it
was
edith
said
to
herself
a
little
pathetically
rather
hard
upon
the
other
person
nobody
can
help
their
thoughts
and
there
was
something
positively
indecent
in
the
uncanny
insight
that
divined
them
all
the
same
edith
confronted
with
the
consequences
of
these
movements
of
the
unfettered
brain
was
stung
with
compunction
and
considerable
shame
horace
would
be
furious
when
he
knew
more
furious
with
edith
than
lucia
therefore
edith
was
furious
with
sophia
roots
the
cause
of
this
disaster
who
must
have
known
that
even
if
lucia
was
too
to
refuse
her
most
improper
invitation
that
invitation
ought
never
to
have
been
given
edith
had
her
pride
the
pride
of
all
the
jewdwines
and
the
hardens
and
her
private
grievances
gave
way
before
a
family
catastrophe
she
did
not
want
lucia
at
hampstead
but
at
all
cost
to
herself
lucia
must
be
brought
back
to
her
house
before
anybody
knew
that
she
had
ever
left
it
it
was
even
better
that
horace
should
marry
her
than
that
they
should
risk
the
scandal
of
a
mesalliance
or
passing
acquaintance
with
a
man
like
rickman
she
would
go
and
fetch
lucia
now
this
very
evening
she
went
as
fast
as
a
hansom
could
take
her
and
was
shown
up
into
rickman
room
where
she
had
the
good
luck
to
find
lucia
alone
lucia
was
too
tired
to
go
out
very
much
and
at
that
moment
of
her
entrance
she
was
resting
on
rickman
sofa
as
the
poor
poet
had
been
so
careful
to
remove
the
more
telling
tokens
of
his
occupation
edith
did
not
see
that
it
was
rickman
room
and
she
was
a
little
surprised
to
find
sophia
roots
so
comfortably
not
to
say
luxuriously
lodged
she
lost
no
time
in
delivering
her
soul
lest
sophia
should
pop
in
upon
them
she
said
with
emphasis
i
think
you
ought
to
have
told
me
told
you
what
why
that
you
had
anywhere
to
go
to
instead
of
coming
here
but
i
did
come
here
because
i
had
anywhere
to
go
to
i
came
because
i
wanted
to
see
something
of
sophie
after
all
these
years
you
could
have
seen
sophie
at
hampstead
i
would
have
asked
her
to
stay
with
you
if
i
known
you
wanted
her
that
would
have
been
very
nice
of
you
but
i
afraid
she
have
come
you
see
she
ca
leave
her
work
at
the
museum
ever
poor
thing
oh
then
you
do
see
so
much
of
sophie
after
all
not
as
much
as
i
should
like
but
i
must
be
somewhere
and
perfectly
happy
here
as
she
rose
to
make
tea
for
edith
at
the
poet
table
and
with
the
poet
brass
kettle
she
looked
to
edith
critical
eyes
most
suspiciously
at
home
edith
eyes
alert
for
literature
roamed
over
the
bookcases
before
they
settled
on
the
the
poet
but
it
was
the
that
brought
her
to
her
point
did
lucia
mix
with
the
other
boarders
after
all
this
is
a
bad
room
she
said
i
suppose
you
have
all
your
meals
up
here
only
tea
and
breakfast
but
my
dear
girl
where
do
you
lunch
and
dine
downstairs
in
the
with
all
the
other
boarders
lucia
smiled
yes
all
of
them
you
see
we
ca
very
well
turn
any
of
them
out
really
lucia
before
you
do
things
like
this
you
might
stop
to
consider
how
your
friends
must
feel
about
it
why
should
they
feel
anything
it
all
right
edith
really
it
is
right
for
you
to
take
your
meals
with
these
dreadful
people
you
ca
say
they
not
dreadful
lucia
for
they
are
they
not
half
so
dreadful
as
you
might
suppose
in
fact
you
no
idea
how
nice
they
can
be
some
of
them
indeed
i
do
know
one
of
them
that
is
kind
and
considerate
and
polite
in
some
way
yes
polite
they
all
inconceivably
polite
and
do
you
know
they
all
want
me
to
stay
on
and
i
half
a
mind
to
stay
oh
no
my
dear
you
not
going
to
stay
i
come
to
carry
you
off
the
very
minute
we
finished
tea
sophia
should
have
known
better
than
to
bring
you
here
poor
little
sophie
if
she
can
stand
it
i
might
that
does
follow
at
all
and
if
you
can
stand
it
your
relations
ca
so
make
up
your
mind
that
you
going
back
with
me
it
extremely
kind
of
you
but
i
should
hurt
sophie
feelings
terribly
if
i
went
why
should
i
go
because
it
is
a
fit
place
for
you
to
be
in
to
begin
with
i
suppose
they
feed
you
properly
you
ca
say
i
look
the
worse
for
it
no
certainly
she
could
for
lucia
looked
better
than
she
had
done
for
many
months
in
the
fine
air
of
hampstead
she
had
been
white
and
languid
and
depressed
here
in
bloomsbury
she
had
a
faint
colour
and
in
spite
of
her
fatigue
looked
almost
vigorous
what
was
more
her
face
bore
out
her
own
account
of
herself
she
had
said
she
was
perfectly
happy
and
she
looked
it
a
horrible
idea
occurred
to
edith
but
she
did
not
mean
to
speak
of
rickman
till
she
had
got
lucia
safe
at
hampstead
besides
said
lucia
simply
i
staying
for
the
best
of
all
possible
reasons
because
i
want
to
well
if
it
pleasant
for
you
you
forget
that
it
anything
but
pleasant
for
horace
and
me
horace
if
you
care
what
he
thinks
would
be
exceedingly
annoyed
if
he
knew
about
it
is
he
just
a
little
unreasonable
he
is
not
is
it
nice
for
him
to
know
that
you
prefer
living
with
these
people
to
staying
in
his
house
what
would
he
say
if
he
knew
that
one
of
these
people
lent
us
this
room
the
words
and
the
smile
that
accompanied
them
challenged
edith
to
speak
and
speak
she
must
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
utter
the
abominable
name
and
was
that
on
sophie
account
or
yours
on
both
our
accounts
and
it
was
beautifully
done
oh
if
it
was
done
beautifully
there
no
doubt
on
whose
account
it
was
done
i
should
have
thought
you
were
the
last
person
lucia
to
put
yourself
under
such
an
obligation
there
was
no
obligation
it
was
kinder
to
rickman
to
take
his
room
than
refuse
it
that
was
all
lucia
had
no
difficulty
whatever
in
bringing
out
the
name
and
that
if
edith
perceptions
had
not
been
dulled
by
horror
would
have
struck
her
as
a
favourable
sign
young
rickman
edith
astonishment
was
a
master
stroke
in
all
that
it
ignored
and
in
all
that
it
implied
of
the
impossibility
of
that
person
your
notions
of
kindness
are
more
than
i
can
understand
whatever
possessed
you
to
take
his
room
if
he
offered
it
fifty
times
but
it
was
wanted
edith
relaxed
the
tension
of
her
indignant
body
and
sank
back
in
her
chair
or
rather
rickman
chair
with
an
immense
relief
you
mean
he
is
in
the
house
at
present
oh
yes
he
in
the
house
i
glad
to
say
neither
sophie
nor
i
could
stand
very
much
of
the
house
without
him
that
admission
instead
of
rousing
edith
to
renewed
indignation
appeared
to
crush
her
lucia
she
murmured
you
are
hopeless
another
cup
of
tea
however
revived
the
spirit
of
remonstrance
i
know
you
do
see
it
lucia
but
you
are
laying
yourself
under
an
obligation
of
the
worst
sort
the
sort
that
puts
a
woman
more
than
anything
in
a
man
power
lucia
ignored
the
baser
implication
so
like
lucia
i
under
so
many
obligations
to
rickman
already
that
one
more
hardly
counts
she
hastened
to
appease
the
dumb
distress
now
visible
on
her
face
i
do
mean
money
obligations
though
there
that
too
horace
knows
all
about
it
i
do
know
if
i
can
explain
she
laid
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
looked
at
edith
and
beyond
her
with
liquid
and
untroubled
eyes
not
seeing
her
but
seeing
things
very
far
off
invisible
from
edith
point
of
view
which
things
she
must
endeavour
if
possible
to
make
her
see
the
kind
of
obligations
i
mean
are
so
difficult
to
describe
because
there
nothing
to
take
hold
of
only
when
you
once
made
a
man
believe
in
you
and
trust
you
so
that
he
comes
to
you
ever
afterwards
expecting
nothing
but
wonderful
discernment
and
irreproachable
tact
and
and
an
almost
impalpable
delicacy
of
treatment
and
you
know
that
you
failed
in
all
these
things
just
when
he
needed
them
most
you
do
feel
some
obligations
there
the
obligation
to
make
up
for
your
blunders
the
obligation
to
think
about
him
in
a
certain
way
because
no
other
way
does
justice
to
his
idea
of
you
the
obligation
to
show
him
the
same
consideration
he
showed
to
you
the
obligation
to
take
a
simple
kindness
from
him
as
he
would
have
taken
it
from
you
my
lucia
you
forget
that
a
man
may
accept
many
things
from
a
woman
that
she
can
not
possibly
accept
from
him
yes
but
they
are
quite
another
set
of
things
they
do
come
into
it
at
all
that
where
you
make
the
mistake
edith
i
got
for
my
own
sake
to
behave
to
that
man
as
finely
as
he
behaved
to
me
i
owe
him
a
sort
of
spiritual
redress
i
always
shall
owe
it
him
but
doing
something
towards
it
now
she
said
to
herself
i
am
a
fool
to
try
to
explain
it
to
her
she
never
understand
i
wish
kitty
were
here
she
would
have
understood
in
a
minute
edith
did
not
understand
she
thought
that
lucia
perceptions
in
this
matter
were
blunt
when
they
were
only
superlatively
fine
all
this
said
she
implies
an
amount
of
intimacy
that
i
was
not
aware
of
intimacy
yes
i
suppose
it
intimacy
of
a
sort
and
how
it
could
have
happened
with
a
man
like
that
a
man
like
what
well
my
dear
girl
a
man
that
horace
would
dream
of
allowing
you
to
meet
even
in
his
own
house
horace
you
talk
about
my
being
under
an
obligation
it
was
he
who
helped
to
put
me
under
it
and
how
by
never
delivering
one
of
my
messages
to
him
by
letting
him
believe
that
i
behaved
horribly
to
him
that
i
sent
him
away
and
never
gave
him
a
thought
when
he
had
been
so
magnificent
there
were
a
thousand
things
i
wanted
to
explain
and
set
right
and
i
asked
horace
for
an
opportunity
and
he
never
gave
it
me
he
ca
blame
me
if
i
take
it
now
if
horace
did
all
these
things
he
did
them
for
the
best
possible
reasons
he
knows
rather
more
of
this
young
man
than
you
do
or
could
have
any
idea
of
i
do
know
what
he
is
now
but
he
was
at
one
time
thoroughly
disreputable
whatever
he
do
do
he
did
everything
he
drank
he
ran
after
the
worst
sort
of
women
he
mixes
now
with
the
lowest
class
of
journalists
in
town
he
lived
for
months
horace
says
with
a
horrid
little
actress
in
the
next
house
to
this
lucia
face
quivered
like
a
pale
flame
i
do
believe
it
i
do
believe
it
for
a
moment
it
absurd
to
say
you
do
believe
what
everybody
knows
and
what
anybody
here
can
tell
you
i
never
heard
a
word
against
him
here
ask
sophie
she
known
him
for
five
years
besides
know
him
that
enough
lucy
when
you
once
get
hold
of
an
idea
you
blind
to
everything
outside
it
i
take
after
my
family
in
that
but
no
i
not
blind
he
may
have
gone
wrong
once
at
some
time
but
never
no
i
sure
of
it
since
i
knew
him
still
when
a
man
has
once
lived
that
sort
of
life
the
coarseness
must
remain
coarseness
there
is
any
refinement
any
gentleness
he
capable
of
he
fine
through
and
through
stay
and
meet
him
edith
and
see
for
yourself
i
met
him
and
yet
you
ca
see
i
seen
all
i
want
to
see
do
edith
there
was
a
sound
of
feet
running
swiftly
up
the
stair
the
door
of
the
adjoining
room
opened
and
shut
and
a
man
voice
was
heard
singing
these
sounds
conveyed
to
edith
a
frightful
sense
of
the
nearness
and
intimacy
of
the
young
man
and
of
the
horror
of
position
as
she
listened
she
held
her
cousin
by
her
two
hands
in
a
dumb
agony
of
entreaty
horace
is
coming
back
she
whispered
no
edith
it
no
good
i
going
to
stay
till
kitty
takes
me
edith
wondered
whether
after
all
lucia
was
so
very
fastidious
and
refined
whether
indeed
in
taking
after
her
family
she
did
not
take
after
the
least
estimable
of
the
hardens
there
was
a
wild
strain
in
them
their
women
had
been
known
to
do
queer
things
unaccountable
disagreeable
disreputable
things
and
lucia
was
sir
daughter
somehow
that
young
voice
singing
in
the
next
room
rubbed
this
impression
into
her
she
stiffened
and
drew
back
and
am
i
to
tell
horace
then
that
you
are
happy
here
yes
tell
him
to
come
and
see
how
happy
i
am
very
well
as
edith
opened
the
door
to
go
the
voice
in
the
next
room
stopped
singing
and
the
young
man
became
suddenly
very
still
chapter
lvii
lucia
lay
back
in
her
chair
wondering
not
at
edith
but
at
herself
her
cousin
visit
had
been
so
far
effectual
that
it
had
made
her
aware
of
the
attitude
of
her
own
mind
if
she
had
been
told
beforehand
that
she
could
be
happy
in
a
bloomsbury
or
within
any
reasonable
distance
of
such
people
as
miss
bishop
and
soper
the
thing
would
have
appeared
to
her
absurd
and
yet
it
was
so
she
was
happy
among
these
dreadful
people
as
she
had
not
been
happy
at
hampstead
among
the
cultured
and
refined
but
when
she
came
to
examine
into
the
nature
of
this
happiness
she
found
that
it
contained
no
positive
element
that
it
consisted
mainly
of
relief
relief
from
the
strain
of
an
incessant
anxiety
and
uncertainty
that
the
strain
had
been
divided
between
her
and
horace
had
only
made
it
worse
for
she
had
had
the
larger
share
of
the
anxiety
he
of
the
uncertainty
not
that
he
was
more
uncertain
than
in
the
old
days
at
harmouth
he
was
less
so
but
she
had
never
been
anxious
then
for
after
all
they
had
understood
each
other
and
apparently
it
was
the
understanding
now
that
failed
yet
horace
had
been
right
when
he
told
himself
that
lucia
would
never
imply
anything
infer
anything
claim
anything
take
anything
for
granted
on
the
sanction
of
that
understanding
she
would
not
have
hurried
by
a
look
or
word
the
slow
movements
of
the
love
which
somehow
he
had
led
her
to
believe
in
love
between
man
and
woman
to
her
mind
was
a
sort
of
genius
and
genius
as
she
said
long
ago
to
poor
rickman
must
always
have
about
it
a
divine
uncertainty
yes
love
too
was
the
wind
of
the
divine
spirit
blowing
where
it
listeth
the
kindling
of
the
divine
fire
she
had
waited
for
it
patiently
reverently
not
altogether
humbly
but
with
a
superb
possession
of
her
soul
better
to
wait
for
years
than
rush
to
meet
it
and
so
be
tossed
by
the
wind
and
shrivelled
by
the
fire
then
when
the
crash
came
five
years
ago
though
she
could
hardly
conceive
it
as
altering
her
cousin
attitude
she
knew
that
it
must
alter
hers
the
understanding
had
been
partly
a
family
affair
and
her
side
of
the
family
was
now
involved
in
debt
and
poverty
and
dishonour
when
the
debts
were
paid
off
and
the
poverty
reduced
and
the
honour
redeemed
it
would
be
time
to
the
understanding
but
as
it
was
just
possible
that
horace
if
not
exactly
fascinated
by
her
debts
and
all
the
rest
of
it
might
feel
that
these
very
things
bound
him
challenged
him
in
some
sort
to
protection
lucia
withdrew
herself
from
the
reach
of
the
chivalrous
delivering
arm
she
took
her
stand
not
quite
outside
the
circle
of
the
cousinly
relation
but
on
the
uttermost
fringe
and
verge
of
it
where
she
entered
more
and
more
into
her
own
possession
they
met
they
wrote
long
letters
to
each
other
all
about
art
and
literature
and
philosophy
those
ancient
unimpassioned
themes
for
if
lucia
assumed
nothing
herself
she
allowed
horace
to
assume
that
whatever
interested
him
must
necessarily
interest
her
in
short
perceiving
the
horrible
situation
in
which
poor
horace
had
been
left
by
that
premature
understanding
she
did
everything
she
could
to
help
him
out
of
it
and
she
succeeded
beyond
her
own
or
horace
expectation
after
three
years
hard
work
when
all
the
debts
were
paid
and
she
was
independent
lucia
thought
she
might
now
trust
herself
to
stay
with
horace
in
his
house
at
hampstead
she
had
stayed
there
already
with
edith
when
horace
was
away
but
that
was
different
and
at
first
all
was
well
that
is
to
say
there
was
no
anxiety
and
no
uncertainty
the
calm
and
successful
critic
of
knew
his
own
mind
and
lucia
said
to
herself
that
she
knew
hers
the
understanding
between
them
was
perfect
now
they
were
simply
first
cousins
each
was
the
other
best
friend
and
they
could
never
be
anything
else
she
stood
very
much
nearer
to
the
heart
of
the
circle
in
a
place
where
it
was
warm
and
comfortable
and
safe
if
horace
could
only
have
let
her
stay
there
all
would
have
been
well
still
but
a
mature
lucia
a
lucia
entirely
calm
and
successful
too
in
her
lesser
way
a
lucia
without
any
drawbacks
and
almost
to
his
mind
as
uncertain
as
himself
a
lucia
who
might
be
carried
off
any
day
before
his
eyes
by
some
one
of
the
many
brilliant
young
men
whom
it
was
impossible
not
to
introduce
to
her
proved
fatally
disturbing
to
horace
jewdwine
and
it
was
then
that
the
anxiety
and
uncertainty
began
they
were
at
their
height
in
the
sixth
year
when
lucia
broke
down
and
came
to
hampstead
to
recover
fate
not
lucia
of
course
you
could
not
think
such
things
about
lucia
seemed
anxious
to
precipitate
matters
and
jewdwine
in
his
soul
abhorred
precipitancy
edith
too
was
secretly
alarmed
and
lucia
could
read
secrets
but
it
was
to
avoid
both
a
grossly
pathetic
appeal
to
the
emotions
and
an
appearance
of
collusion
with
the
intrigues
of
fate
that
lucia
had
feigned
recovery
and
betaken
herself
to
sophie
in
tavistock
place
before
and
this
was
subtlety
again
well
before
the
return
of
horace
from
his
holiday
and
if
the
awful
reflection
visited
her
that
this
step
might
prove
to
be
a
more
importunate
appeal
than
any
to
be
a
positive
forcing
of
his
hand
edith
had
dissipated
it
by
showing
very
plainly
that
the
appeal
was
to
their
pride
and
not
their
pity
lucia
did
not
consider
herself
by
any
means
an
object
of
pity
she
was
happy
the
absence
of
intolerable
tension
was
enough
to
make
her
so
as
for
the
society
she
was
thrown
with
after
the
wear
of
incessant
subtleties
and
uncertainties
there
was
something
positively
soothing
in
straightforward
uninspired
vulgarity
these
people
knew
their
own
minds
if
their
minds
were
not
worth
knowing
and
that
was
something
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
own
mind
was
growing
healthier
every
day
till
by
the
time
edith
visited
her
there
was
no
need
to
feign
recovery
for
recovery
had
come
and
with
it
had
come
many
benign
and
salutary
things
the
old
delicious
joy
of
giving
pleasure
a
new
sense
of
the
redeeming
and
atoning
pathos
of
the
world
all
manner
of
sweet
compunctions
and
tender
tolerances
the
divine
chance
she
told
herself
for
all
the
charities
in
which
she
might
have
failed
there
had
come
sophie
and
there
had
come
at
last
in
spite
of
everything
keith
rickman
as
for
keith
rickman
her
interest
in
him
was
not
only
a
strong
personal
matter
but
it
had
been
part
of
the
cool
intellectual
game
she
had
played
for
horace
distraction
and
her
own
deception
a
game
which
horace
with
his
subterfuges
and
suppressions
had
not
played
fair
but
when
seeking
to
excuse
him
she
began
to
consider
the
possible
motives
of
her
cousin
behaviour
lucia
was
profoundly
disturbed
it
had
come
to
this
if
horace
had
cared
for
her
he
might
have
had
a
right
to
interfere
but
he
did
not
care
therefore
no
interference
she
vowed
should
come
between
her
and
her
friendship
for
the
poet
who
had
honoured
her
by
trusting
her
she
could
not
help
feeling
a
little
bitter
with
horace
for
the
harm
he
had
done
her
or
rather
might
have
done
her
in
keith
rickman
eyes
for
all
that
she
had
now
to
make
amends
chapter
lviii
meanwhile
the
beaver
like
a
sensible
beaver
went
on
calmly
furnishing
her
house
she
thoroughly
approved
of
keith
acquaintance
with
miss
harden
as
she
approved
of
everything
that
gave
importance
to
the
man
she
was
going
to
marry
if
she
had
not
yet
given
a
thought
to
his
work
except
as
a
way
rather
more
uncertain
and
unsatisfactory
than
most
ways
of
making
money
she
thought
a
great
deal
of
the
consideration
it
brought
him
with
that
lady
she
was
prouder
of
keith
now
than
she
ever
had
been
before
but
the
beaver
was
before
all
things
a
practical
person
and
she
had
perceived
further
that
for
keith
to
make
up
to
people
like
miss
harden
was
one
of
the
surest
and
quickest
means
of
getting
on
hitherto
she
had
been
both
distressed
and
annoyed
by
his
backwardness
in
making
up
to
anybody
and
when
keith
told
her
that
he
wanted
to
pay
some
attention
to
his
cousin
if
she
was
a
little
surprised
at
this
unusual
display
of
smartness
for
when
had
keith
been
known
to
pay
attention
to
any
editors
let
alone
their
cousins
she
accepted
the
explanation
as
entirely
natural
she
was
wide
awake
now
to
the
importance
of
and
jewdwine
by
all
means
then
let
him
cultivate
jewdwine
cousin
and
if
there
had
been
no
jewdwine
in
the
case
flossie
would
still
have
smiled
on
the
acquaintance
for
it
meant
social
advancement
a
step
nearer
kensington
so
nobody
was
more
delighted
than
flossie
when
miss
harden
invited
keith
to
tea
in
her
own
room
especially
as
she
was
always
included
in
the
invitation
it
was
miss
bishop
primed
with
all
the
resources
of
her
science
who
looked
upon
these
advances
with
alarm
it
struck
miss
bishop
that
miss
harden
and
rickman
were
going
it
pretty
strong
she
would
have
liked
those
goings
on
if
she
been
flossie
you
might
take
it
from
her
that
gentlemen
never
knew
their
own
minds
when
there
were
two
to
choose
from
and
miss
bishop
had
a
doubt
that
it
was
a
between
flossie
and
miss
harden
miss
harden
would
be
willing
enough
anybody
could
see
that
ladies
do
keep
on
asking
gentlemen
to
have
tea
with
them
alone
in
their
rooms
if
they
not
up
to
something
it
was
not
only
miss
bishop
fatal
science
that
led
her
to
these
conclusions
but
the
still
more
fatal
prescience
of
love
when
flossie
was
once
securely
married
to
rickman
the
heart
of
spinks
would
turn
to
her
for
consolation
that
she
knew
it
was
a
matter
of
common
experience
that
gentlemen
hearts
were
thus
caught
on
the
rebound
but
if
that
miss
harden
carried
off
rickman
there
would
be
nothing
left
for
flossie
but
to
marry
spinks
for
the
preservation
of
her
trousseau
and
her
dignity
therefore
miss
bishop
was
more
than
ever
set
on
flossie
marrying
rickman
they
were
turning
over
the
trousseau
the
trousseau
which
might
play
such
a
disastrous
part
in
the
final
adjustment
of
flossie
mind
your
dresses
are
orfully
smart
and
that
said
ada
and
yet
somehow
they
do
seem
to
do
you
justice
it
would
have
been
worth
your
while
to
go
to
a
dressmaker
my
dear
you
have
a
better
chance
than
that
miss
harden
any
day
no
i
do
like
you
in
that
powder
blue
i
do
really
miss
bishop
was
nothing
if
not
frank
i
never
go
wrong
about
a
colour
said
flossie
passionately
no
it
is
the
colour
it
the
cut
it
makes
her
look
as
if
she
a
better
figure
than
you
and
that
nonsense
you
got
a
bust
and
she
has
gentlemen
do
care
to
look
at
a
girl
who
as
flat
as
two
boards
back
and
front
that
what
i
say
it
the
cut
that
gives
her
her
style
no
it
is
it
is
her
clothes
at
all
it
the
way
she
carries
them
she
may
look
as
if
she
was
well
dressed
but
she
is
anyhow
i
like
that
coat
of
hers
better
than
yours
it
has
got
the
new
sleeves
said
flossie
fondling
her
it
was
this
immobile
complacency
of
hers
in
the
face
of
his
own
profound
and
sundering
agitations
that
stirred
in
rickman
the
first
stinging
of
remorse
for
he
could
see
that
the
poor
beaver
with
her
blind
and
ineradicable
instinct
was
going
on
building
you
call
them
castles
in
the
air
but
houses
such
as
beavers
build
houses
of
mud
in
running
water
her
ceaseless
winding
in
and
out
of
shops
her
mad
and
furious
buying
of
furniture
her
wild
grasping
at
any
loose
articles
that
came
in
her
way
from
rugs
to
appeared
to
him
as
so
many
futile
efforts
to
construct
a
dam
over
and
over
again
the
insane
impulse
came
on
him
to
seize
her
little
hands
and
stop
her
to
tell
her
that
it
was
no
good
that
the
absurd
thing
could
never
stand
that
he
alone
knew
the
strength
of
the
stream
its
sources
and
its
currents
but
he
had
the
heart
to
tell
her
and
the
beaver
went
on
constructing
her
dam
without
knowing
that
it
was
a
dam
because
she
was
born
with
the
passion
thus
to
build
she
could
not
see
that
anything
had
happened
and
heaven
forbid
that
he
should
let
her
see
he
might
abandon
hope
but
the
beaver
he
could
not
abandon
that
was
not
to
be
thought
of
for
an
instant
he
was
too
deeply
pledged
for
that
lest
he
should
be
in
danger
of
forgetting
it
was
brought
home
to
him
a
dozen
times
a
day
the
very
moment
when
flossie
was
making
that
triumphant
display
of
her
wedding
finery
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
iniquitously
as
he
passed
her
room
on
his
way
to
spinks
she
was
standing
a
jubilant
little
figure
in
the
line
of
the
door
shaking
out
and
trailing
before
her
some
white
shiny
frilly
thing
the
sight
of
which
made
him
shudder
for
the
terror
and
sigh
for
the
pity
of
it
and
the
girls
laughter
and
the
banging
of
the
door
as
he
went
by
what
was
it
but
a
reminder
of
the
proprieties
and
decencies
that
bound
him
a
hint
that
he
had
pledged
himself
thrice
over
by
that
unlawful
peep
it
seemed
to
him
that
was
the
beginning
of
many
unlawful
glimpses
discoveries
of
things
he
ought
never
to
have
seen
was
it
that
he
was
more
quick
to
see
or
that
flossie
was
less
careful
than
she
had
been
or
was
it
simply
the
result
of
living
in
this
detestable
where
morally
speaking
the
doors
were
never
shut
propinquity
that
had
brought
them
together
had
done
its
best
for
flossie
and
its
worst
it
had
revealed
too
little
and
too
much
he
had
only
to
forget
her
for
a
week
to
come
back
and
see
her
as
she
really
was
to
wonder
what
he
had
ever
seen
in
her
her
very
prettiness
offended
him
her
flagrantly
feminine
contours
once
admired
now
struck
him
as
exaggerated
as
an
emphasis
of
the
charm
which
is
most
subduing
when
subdued
as
for
her
mind
good
heavens
had
it
taken
him
five
years
to
discover
that
her
mind
was
a
de
when
he
came
to
think
of
it
he
had
to
own
that
intellectually
conversationally
even
he
had
advanced
no
farther
with
her
than
on
the
first
day
of
their
acquaintance
there
was
something
compact
and
immovable
about
flossie
in
those
five
years
he
had
never
known
her
change
or
modify
an
opinion
of
people
or
of
things
and
yet
flossie
was
not
stupid
or
if
she
were
her
stupidity
was
a
force
it
had
an
invincible
impetus
and
sweep
dragging
the
dead
weight
of
character
behind
it
it
was
beginning
to
terrify
him
in
fact
he
was
becoming
painfully
sensitive
to
everything
she
said
or
did
her
little
tongue
was
neither
sharp
nor
hard
and
yet
it
hurt
him
every
time
it
spoke
it
did
not
always
speak
good
grammar
sometimes
in
moments
of
flurry
or
excitement
an
aspirate
miscarried
happily
those
moments
were
rare
for
at
bottom
flossie
temperament
was
singularly
calm
remembering
his
own
past
lapses
he
felt
that
he
was
the
last
person
to
throw
a
stone
at
her
but
that
reflection
did
not
prevent
a
shudder
from
going
down
his
back
every
time
it
happened
and
if
her
speech
remained
irreproachable
the
offending
strain
ran
through
all
her
movements
he
disliked
the
way
she
walked
and
the
way
she
sat
down
the
way
she
spread
her
skirts
or
gathered
them
the
way
she
carried
her
body
and
turned
her
head
the
way
her
black
eyes
provoked
a
stare
and
then
resented
it
her
changes
of
posture
under
observation
the
perpetual
movement
of
her
hands
that
were
always
settling
and
resettling
her
hat
her
hair
her
veil
all
the
blushings
and
bridlings
the
pruderies
and
impertinences
of
the
pretty
woman
of
her
class
he
disliked
them
all
he
more
than
disliked
he
distrusted
her
air
of
propriety
he
detected
in
it
the
first
note
of
falseness
in
her
character
in
a
thousand
little
things
her
instincts
her
perceptions
were
at
fault
this
was
disagreeably
borne
in
upon
him
that
first
saturday
after
lucia
arrival
when
he
and
flossie
were
in
the
train
going
down
to
ealing
the
compartment
was
packed
with
city
men
how
he
wished
flossie
would
turn
her
head
and
not
her
eyes
if
she
must
look
at
them
and
as
they
got
in
at
earl
court
one
of
them
a
polite
person
gave
up
his
seat
to
the
lady
flossie
turned
an
unseeing
eye
on
the
polite
person
and
took
his
seat
with
a
superb
pretence
of
having
found
it
herself
after
much
search
and
when
rickman
said
thanks
to
the
polite
person
her
indignant
glance
informed
him
that
she
had
expected
support
in
her
policy
of
repudiation
my
dear
beaver
he
said
as
he
helped
her
on
to
the
platform
at
ealing
when
you
take
another
person
seat
the
least
you
can
do
is
to
say
thank
you
i
speak
to
gentlemen
in
trains
and
buses
that
the
way
they
always
begin
good
heavens
the
poor
man
was
only
being
civil
thank
you
i
gone
about
enough
to
know
what
kind
of
civility
means
i
was
going
to
lay
myself
open
to
impertinence
i
should
have
thought
you
gone
about
enough
to
know
the
difference
flossie
said
nothing
she
was
furious
with
him
for
his
failure
to
defend
her
from
the
insulting
advances
of
the
city
gentleman
but
perhaps
she
would
hardly
have
taken
it
so
seriously
if
it
had
not
been
significant
to
her
of
a
still
more
intolerable
desertion
ada
bishop
had
said
something
to
her
just
before
they
started
something
that
had
been
almost
too
much
even
for
flossie
complacency
i
glad
she
still
heard
ada
saying
you
going
to
take
him
out
all
day
if
i
were
you
i
should
let
him
see
too
much
of
that
miss
harden
there
had
been
much
to
take
hold
of
in
ada
words
but
manner
had
made
them
unmistakable
and
from
that
moment
a
little
worm
had
begun
to
gnaw
at
flossie
heart
and
he
as
he
looked
at
her
with
that
strange
new
sight
of
his
that
was
already
bringing
sorrow
to
them
both
he
said
to
himself
that
he
supposed
it
was
her
going
about
her
sad
acquaintance
with
unlovely
manners
that
had
made
her
as
she
was
only
how
was
it
that
he
had
never
noticed
it
before
poor
little
girl
it
was
only
last
saturday
when
they
had
come
back
from
looking
over
the
house
at
ealing
that
drawing
upon
all
the
appropriate
resources
of
natural
history
he
had
called
her
a
little
vesper
vole
because
she
lived
in
a
bank
and
only
came
out
of
it
in
the
evening
what
flossie
called
him
that
time
did
matter
it
was
her
parsimony
in
the
item
of
endearments
that
provoked
him
to
excesses
of
the
kind
and
now
the
thought
of
those
things
made
him
furious
furious
with
himself
furious
with
fate
for
throwing
flossie
in
his
way
furious
with
flossie
for
being
there
and
when
he
was
ready
to
damn
her
because
she
was
a
woman
he
melted
and
could
have
wept
because
she
was
a
beaver
poor
little
girl
one
day
to
be
called
a
vesper
vole
the
next
to
be
forgotten
altogether
the
next
to
be
remembered
after
this
fashion
and
so
they
went
on
silently
together
flossie
in
pain
because
of
the
little
worm
gnawing
at
her
heart
he
thinking
many
things
sad
and
bitter
and
tender
things
of
the
woman
walking
by
his
side
from
time
to
time
she
looked
at
him
as
she
had
looked
at
those
city
gentlemen
not
turning
her
head
but
slewing
the
large
dark
of
her
eye
into
its
corner
presently
she
spoke
you
do
seem
to
have
very
much
to
say
for
yourself
i
not
given
to
talking
very
much
at
any
time
oh
come
you
do
seem
to
have
any
difficulty
in
talking
to
miss
harden
i
heard
you
wot
a
time
you
did
sit
yesterday
and
you
were
up
there
an
hour
or
more
before
i
came
i
know
three
quarters
of
an
hour
to
be
strictly
accurate
well
that
was
long
enough
was
it
quite
long
enough
for
all
i
had
to
say
now
that
was
playing
into
flossie
hands
for
it
meant
that
he
had
had
nothing
to
say
after
her
arrival
and
she
was
sharp
enough
to
see
it
that
all
very
well
keith
said
she
apparently
ignoring
her
advantage
but
ada
says
they
be
talking
if
she
keeps
on
asking
you
up
there
just
when
she
all
by
herself
it
not
the
thing
to
do
i
would
do
it
if
it
was
me
no
more
would
ada
my
dear
child
miss
harden
may
do
a
great
many
things
that
you
and
ada
may
because
you
see
she
knows
how
to
do
them
and
you
do
oh
well
if
you
satisfied
but
it
is
very
nice
for
me
to
you
talked
about
just
when
we
going
to
be
married
is
it
i
think
you
need
mind
ada
miss
harden
knows
that
i
to
see
her
sometimes
and
that
i
ca
very
well
see
her
in
any
other
way
and
i
think
you
might
know
it
too
oh
do
you
go
thinking
i
jealous
i
know
all
right
if
i
all
right
who
wrong
well
of
course
i
understand
what
you
want
with
but
i
see
what
she
wants
with
you
you
fool
what
should
she
want
except
to
help
me
flossie
said
nothing
to
that
for
indeed
her
mind
had
not
formulated
any
clear
charge
against
miss
harden
keith
had
annoyed
her
and
she
wanted
to
punish
him
a
little
she
was
also
curious
to
see
in
what
manner
the
chivalry
that
had
deserted
her
would
defend
miss
harden
he
stood
still
and
looked
at
her
with
brilliant
angry
eyes
you
do
understand
a
great
deal
flossie
but
there
one
thing
you
understand
you
are
not
to
say
these
things
about
miss
harden
not
that
you
do
her
any
harm
mind
by
saying
them
think
for
one
minute
who
and
what
she
is
and
you
see
that
the
only
person
you
are
harming
is
yourself
flossie
did
think
for
a
minute
and
remembered
that
lucia
was
the
daughter
of
a
baronet
and
the
cousin
of
an
editor
and
she
did
see
that
this
time
she
had
gone
a
bit
too
far
and
in
injuring
yourself
you
know
you
injure
me
he
said
more
gently
i
do
know
whether
that
will
appeal
at
all
to
you
it
did
appeal
to
her
in
the
sense
in
which
her
practical
mind
understood
that
injury
do
you
really
think
she
be
able
to
help
you
to
a
good
thing
he
laughed
aloud
i
think
she
help
me
to
many
good
things
she
has
done
that
already
oh
well
then
i
suppose
it
all
right
though
he
said
it
was
all
right
he
knew
that
it
was
all
wrong
that
she
was
all
wrong
too
he
wondered
again
how
it
was
that
he
had
never
noticed
it
before
it
seemed
to
him
now
that
he
must
always
have
seen
it
and
that
he
had
struggled
not
to
see
it
as
he
was
struggling
now
struggle
as
he
would
he
knew
that
he
was
only
putting
off
the
inevitable
surrender
putting
off
the
moment
that
must
face
him
yet
at
some
turning
of
the
stair
or
opening
of
a
door
as
they
went
from
room
to
room
of
the
house
that
empty
had
once
seemed
to
him
desirable
and
now
littered
with
the
solid
irrevocable
results
of
flossie
furnishing
inspired
him
with
detestation
and
despair
how
could
he
ever
live
in
it
he
and
his
dream
the
dream
that
lucia
had
told
him
was
divorced
from
reality
she
had
told
him
too
that
his
trouble
all
lay
there
and
he
remembered
that
then
as
now
she
had
advised
a
reconciliation
but
better
a
divorce
than
reconciliation
with
any
of
the
realities
that
faced
him
now
better
even
illusion
than
these
infallible
perceptions
better
to
be
decently
charitably
blind
where
women
are
concerned
than
to
see
them
so
to
see
poor
flossie
as
she
was
a
reality
divorced
from
any
dream
a
foolish
train
of
thought
that
as
if
he
were
only
a
dreamer
as
if
it
were
a
dream
that
had
to
do
with
it
as
if
his
dream
had
not
long
ago
loved
followed
and
embraced
a
divine
reality
as
if
it
had
ever
fallen
away
after
that
one
superb
act
of
reconciliation
he
had
done
poor
flossie
some
injustice
she
suffered
in
his
eyes
because
she
came
short
not
of
the
dream
but
of
the
reality
to
be
placed
beside
lucia
harden
would
have
been
a
severe
test
for
any
woman
but
for
flossie
it
was
cruelty
itself
he
had
never
subjected
her
to
that
not
even
in
thought
for
he
felt
that
the
comparison
cruel
to
one
woman
was
profanation
to
the
other
it
was
only
feminine
fate
who
could
be
so
unkind
as
to
put
those
two
side
by
side
that
he
might
look
well
and
measure
his
love
for
flossie
by
his
love
for
lucia
seeing
it
too
as
it
was
maddox
had
not
been
far
wrong
there
for
anything
spiritual
in
that
emotion
he
might
as
well
have
gone
back
to
poppy
grace
better
since
between
him
and
flossie
that
gross
tie
once
formed
could
not
be
broken
better
since
there
had
at
least
been
no
hypocrisy
in
his
relations
with
the
joyous
poppy
better
anything
than
this
baseness
skulking
under
the
superstition
of
morality
if
a
man
has
no
other
feeling
for
an
innocent
woman
than
that
better
that
a
should
be
hanged
about
his
neck
than
that
he
should
offend
by
marrying
her
and
yet
there
had
been
something
finer
and
purer
in
this
later
love
than
in
the
first
infatuation
of
his
youth
on
that
day
seven
days
ago
the
last
day
it
had
to
live
he
had
been
touched
by
something
more
sacred
more
immortal
than
desire
there
had
been
no
illusion
in
the
poetry
that
clothed
the
figure
of
a
woman
standing
in
an
empty
room
dearer
to
her
than
the
bridal
chamber
a
woman
whose
face
grew
soft
as
her
instinct
outran
the
bridal
terror
and
the
bridal
joy
divining
beyond
love
the
end
that
sanctifies
it
but
beyond
all
that
again
he
could
see
that
whereas
the
love
of
all
other
women
had
torn
him
asunder
the
love
of
lucia
made
him
whole
poppy
had
drawn
him
by
his
senses
flossie
by
his
senses
and
his
heart
lucia
held
him
by
his
senses
his
heart
his
intellect
his
will
by
his
spirit
by
his
genius
by
the
whole
man
long
after
his
senses
had
renounced
their
part
in
her
the
rest
of
him
would
cling
to
her
satisfied
and
appeased
and
but
for
flossie
it
would
have
been
so
even
now
though
his
senses
had
rest
in
lucia
presence
their
longing
for
her
was
reawakened
not
only
by
the
thought
of
his
approaching
marriage
but
by
the
memory
of
that
one
moment
when
he
had
realized
the
mystery
of
it
the
moment
of
poor
transfiguration
when
he
had
seen
through
the
thick
material
veil
deep
into
the
spiritual
heart
of
love
with
lucia
the
veil
had
been
transparent
from
the
first
it
was
not
with
her
as
it
was
with
those
women
who
must
wait
for
the
hour
of
motherhood
to
glorify
them
of
those
two
years
of
his
betrothal
what
was
there
that
he
would
care
to
keep
only
one
immortal
moment
that
yet
knew
of
the
mortality
before
and
after
it
while
of
the
last
seven
days
lucia
had
made
a
whole
heavenly
procession
of
ascending
hours
every
moment
winged
with
the
immortal
fire
flying
moments
but
flame
touched
flame
in
flying
and
they
became
one
life
but
he
was
going
to
marry
flossie
and
she
the
child
that
was
to
have
borne
the
burden
of
his
genius
and
his
passion
poor
little
blameless
victim
of
the
imagination
that
glorifies
desire
how
would
it
be
with
her
in
this
empty
house
empty
of
the
love
she
had
looked
for
and
would
never
find
how
would
it
be
with
him
had
he
pledged
himself
to
a
life
of
falsehood
and
had
he
yet
to
know
what
torment
awaited
him
at
the
hands
of
the
avenging
truth
truth
as
he
had
once
defined
it
was
the
soul
of
the
fact
it
was
the
fact
that
he
was
going
to
marry
flossie
but
it
was
not
the
truth
only
love
could
have
given
it
a
soul
and
made
it
true
if
he
was
bound
to
maintain
that
it
had
a
soul
when
it
had
that
was
where
the
falseness
would
come
in
yet
no
he
might
go
mad
by
thinking
about
it
but
life
after
all
was
simpler
than
thought
things
righted
themselves
when
you
left
off
thinking
about
them
he
would
be
unhappy
but
that
could
only
make
flossie
unhappy
if
she
cared
for
him
and
in
a
year
time
when
he
had
left
off
thinking
she
would
have
left
off
caring
he
had
shrewdly
divined
that
what
flossie
chiefly
wanted
was
to
have
children
or
if
she
did
not
want
it
nature
wanted
it
for
her
which
came
to
the
same
thing
as
for
mating
her
to
a
man
of
genius
that
was
just
wanton
extravagance
maddox
had
once
said
that
any
man
would
have
done
as
well
perhaps
better
flossie
would
care
well
he
would
give
her
children
and
she
would
care
for
them
indeed
he
sincerely
hoped
that
for
him
she
would
not
care
it
would
make
things
simpler
maddox
he
remembered
had
also
said
that
she
was
the
sort
of
woman
who
would
immolate
her
husband
for
her
children
whereas
poppy
but
then
maddox
was
a
beast
it
never
occurred
for
a
moment
to
him
to
throw
flossie
over
that
he
had
settled
once
for
all
could
not
now
be
done
circumstances
conspired
to
make
the
thing
irrevocable
her
utter
dependence
on
him
the
fact
that
she
had
no
home
but
the
one
he
offered
her
no
choice
between
marriage
and
earning
her
own
living
in
a
way
she
hated
the
flagrant
intimacy
in
which
they
had
been
living
more
than
all
the
baseness
of
his
past
love
and
the
inadequacy
of
his
present
feeling
for
her
both
calling
on
him
to
atone
all
these
things
made
a
promise
of
marriage
as
binding
as
the
actual
tie
their
engagement
might
possibly
have
been
broken
off
at
any
of
its
earlier
stages
without
profound
dishonour
it
was
one
thing
to
jilt
a
girl
within
a
decent
interval
of
the
first
congratulations
another
thing
altogether
to
abandon
her
with
her
trousseau
on
her
hands
it
had
gone
so
far
that
his
failure
at
the
last
moment
would
be
the
grossest
insult
he
could
offer
her
gross
indeed
yet
not
so
gross
but
that
he
could
think
of
one
still
grosser
to
let
her
marry
him
when
he
had
no
feeling
to
offer
her
but
such
indifference
as
marriage
deepens
to
disgust
or
such
disgust
as
it
tones
down
into
indifference
would
he
go
on
shuddering
and
wincing
as
he
had
shuddered
and
winced
passion
that
might
have
condoned
her
failings
was
out
of
the
question
but
would
it
be
possible
to
keep
up
the
decent
appearance
of
respect
and
yet
he
was
going
to
marry
her
that
was
impressed
on
him
by
flossie
voice
saying
that
if
he
would
decide
which
of
those
two
rooms
was
to
be
room
she
must
because
the
men
wanted
to
put
up
the
bedstead
it
was
an
intimation
that
he
was
bound
to
her
not
by
any
fine
ties
of
feeling
or
of
honour
but
by
a
stout
unbreakable
chain
of
material
facts
he
looked
out
of
the
window
the
vans
were
unloading
in
the
street
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
something
almost
grossly
compromising
in
the
dumped
down
there
in
the
garden
and
as
the
bedstead
was
being
borne
into
the
house
in
portions
reverentially
processionally
he
surrendered
before
that
supreme
symbol
of
finality
as
he
had
made
his
bed
he
must
lie
even
if
it
was
a
brass
bed
with
ornaments
and
he
refused
to
listen
to
the
inner
voice
which
suggested
that
the
bed
was
not
made
yet
it
was
not
even
paid
for
and
that
he
would
be
a
fool
to
lie
on
it
he
turned
sad
eyes
on
the
little
woman
so
flushed
and
eager
over
her
packages
he
had
committed
himself
more
deeply
with
every
purchase
they
had
made
that
day
how
carefully
he
had
laboured
at
his
own
destruction
he
had
gone
so
far
with
these
absurd
reflections
that
when
flossie
exclaimed
there
after
all
i
forgotten
the
kitchen
hammer
his
nerves
relaxed
their
tension
and
he
experienced
a
sense
of
momentary
but
divine
release
and
when
she
insisted
on
repairing
her
oversight
as
they
went
back
he
felt
that
the
kitchen
hammer
had
clinched
the
matter
and
that
if
only
they
had
not
bought
it
he
might
yet
be
free
there
was
something
in
the
beaver
building
after
all
chapter
lix
he
did
not
appear
that
evening
not
even
to
listen
to
lucia
music
for
his
misery
was
heavy
upon
him
mercifully
he
was
able
to
forget
it
for
a
while
in
attending
to
the
work
that
waited
for
him
an
article
for
to
be
written
proofs
to
correct
and
manuscripts
to
look
through
for
all
neglected
till
the
last
possible
moment
which
moment
had
now
come
for
once
he
reaped
the
benefit
of
his
reckless
habits
of
postponement
but
four
hours
saw
him
through
it
and
midnight
recalled
him
to
his
care
instead
of
undressing
he
refilled
his
lamp
made
up
his
fire
and
drew
his
chair
to
the
hearth
there
was
a
question
put
off
too
like
his
work
from
hour
to
hour
and
silenced
by
the
scuffling
meaningless
movements
of
the
day
it
related
to
the
promise
he
had
made
to
lucia
harden
at
the
end
of
their
last
interview
he
had
then
said
to
her
that
since
she
desired
it
she
should
know
what
it
was
that
she
had
done
for
him
hitherto
he
had
determined
that
she
should
not
know
it
yet
not
know
it
till
death
had
removed
from
her
his
embarrassing
preposterous
personality
the
gift
of
knowledge
that
she
might
have
refused
from
the
man
she
could
then
accept
from
the
poet
the
only
condition
that
honour
that
chivalry
insisted
on
was
the
removal
of
the
man
but
there
were
other
ways
of
getting
rid
of
a
man
besides
the
clumsy
device
of
death
might
he
not
be
considered
to
have
effaced
himself
sufficiently
by
marriage
as
far
as
lucia
was
concerned
he
could
see
very
little
difference
between
the
two
processes
in
fact
marriage
was
if
anything
the
safer
for
the
important
thing
was
that
she
should
know
somehow
that
he
should
hand
over
his
gift
to
her
before
it
was
too
late
and
suppose
suppose
he
should
fail
to
remove
himself
in
time
beholding
the
years
as
they
now
stretched
before
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
would
never
die
there
was
another
consideration
which
concerned
his
honour
not
as
a
man
but
as
a
poet
he
knew
what
it
was
in
him
to
do
the
nature
of
the
gift
was
such
that
if
he
brought
it
to
her
she
would
know
that
he
had
given
her
his
best
if
he
kept
it
till
it
would
be
his
best
no
longer
besides
it
was
only
a
gift
when
you
looked
at
it
one
way
he
was
giving
her
as
he
believed
an
immortal
thing
but
its
very
immortality
gave
it
a
certain
material
value
the
thing
might
be
sold
for
much
and
its
price
might
go
far
towards
covering
that
debt
he
owed
her
or
it
might
be
held
by
her
as
a
sort
of
security
he
could
see
that
his
marriage
would
be
a
hindrance
to
speedy
payment
on
any
other
system
he
rose
unlocked
a
drawer
and
took
from
it
the
manuscript
of
the
nine
and
twenty
sonnets
and
the
sealed
envelope
that
contained
his
testament
concerning
them
he
had
looked
at
them
but
once
since
he
had
put
them
away
three
years
ago
and
that
was
on
the
night
of
his
engagement
looking
at
them
again
he
knew
he
was
not
mistaken
in
his
judgement
when
calmly
surely
and
persistently
he
had
thought
of
the
thing
as
immortal
but
according
to
another
condition
that
his
honour
had
laid
down
its
immortality
depended
upon
her
at
this
point
honour
itself
raised
the
question
whether
it
was
fair
to
throw
on
her
the
burden
of
so
great
a
decision
she
might
hesitate
to
deny
him
so
large
a
part
of
his
immortality
and
yet
object
to
being
so
intimately
so
personally
bound
up
with
it
he
could
see
her
delicate
conscience
straining
under
the
choice
but
surely
she
knew
him
well
enough
to
know
that
he
had
left
her
free
she
would
know
that
he
could
accept
nothing
from
her
pity
not
even
a
portion
of
his
immortality
she
would
trust
his
sincerity
for
that
at
any
rate
had
never
failed
her
and
since
what
he
had
written
he
had
written
she
would
see
that
unless
he
destroyed
it
with
his
own
hands
the
decision
as
to
publication
must
rest
with
her
it
concerned
her
so
intimately
so
personally
that
it
could
not
be
given
to
the
world
without
her
consent
whether
what
he
had
written
should
have
been
written
was
another
matter
if
she
thought
not
if
her
refinement
accused
him
of
a
sin
against
good
taste
that
would
only
make
his
problem
simpler
even
if
her
accusation
remained
unspoken
he
would
know
it
he
would
see
it
through
whatever
web
her
tenderness
wrapped
round
it
his
genius
would
contend
against
her
judgement
would
not
yield
a
point
to
her
opinion
but
his
honour
would
take
it
as
settling
the
question
of
publication
in
no
case
should
she
be
able
to
say
or
think
that
he
had
used
his
genius
as
a
cover
for
a
cowardly
passion
or
that
by
compelling
her
admiration
he
had
taken
advantage
of
her
pride
but
would
she
say
it
or
think
it
not
she
he
knew
her
and
if
his
knowledge
had
brought
much
misery
it
brought
consolation
too
where
lucia
was
concerned
he
had
never
been
sustained
by
any
personal
conceit
he
had
never
walked
vainly
in
the
illusion
of
her
love
at
that
supreme
point
his
imagination
had
utterly
broken
down
he
had
never
won
from
it
a
moment
respite
from
his
intolerable
lucidity
there
was
a
certain
dignity
about
his
despair
in
that
of
all
the
wonderful
web
of
his
dreams
he
had
made
no
fine
cloak
to
cover
it
it
shivered
and
suffered
in
a
noble
nakedness
absolutely
unashamed
but
one
thing
he
knew
also
that
if
lucia
did
not
love
him
she
loved
his
genius
even
when
lucidity
made
suffering
unendurable
he
had
still
the
assurance
that
his
genius
would
never
suffer
at
her
hands
for
did
she
not
know
that
god
gives
the
heart
of
a
poet
to
be
as
fuel
to
his
genius
for
ever
consumed
and
inconsumable
that
of
all
his
passions
his
love
is
the
nearest
akin
to
the
divine
fire
she
of
all
women
would
never
deny
him
the
eternal
right
to
utterance
neither
could
she
well
find
fault
with
the
manner
of
it
he
went
through
the
sonnets
again
trying
to
read
them
with
her
woman
eyes
there
was
nothing
nothing
not
an
image
not
a
word
that
could
offend
here
was
no
flaming
orgy
of
individuality
he
had
chosen
purposely
the
consecrated
form
that
pledged
him
to
perfection
bound
him
to
a
magnificent
restraint
there
still
remained
the
scruple
as
to
the
propriety
of
choosing
this
precise
moment
for
his
gift
it
was
by
the
invincible
desire
to
give
the
torturing
curiosity
to
know
how
she
would
take
it
one
more
last
scruple
easily
disposed
of
in
all
this
there
was
no
disloyalty
to
the
woman
he
was
going
to
make
his
wife
for
the
sonnets
belonged
to
the
past
in
which
she
had
no
part
and
to
the
future
which
concerned
her
even
less
the
next
day
then
at
about
five
the
time
at
which
lucia
had
told
him
she
would
be
free
he
came
to
her
bringing
his
gift
with
him
lucia
face
gladdened
when
she
saw
the
manuscript
in
his
hand
for
though
they
had
discussed
very
freely
what
he
had
done
once
he
had
been
rather
sadly
silent
she
thought
as
to
what
he
was
doing
now
he
had
seemed
to
her
anxious
to
avoid
any
question
on
the
subject
she
had
wondered
whether
his
genius
had
been
much
affected
by
his
other
work
and
had
been
half
afraid
to
ask
lest
she
should
learn
that
it
was
dead
destroyed
by
journalism
she
had
heard
so
much
of
the
perils
of
that
career
that
she
had
begun
to
regret
her
part
in
helping
him
to
it
so
that
her
glance
as
it
lighted
on
the
gift
was
he
thought
propitious
he
drew
up
his
chair
near
her
he
had
not
to
wait
for
any
invitation
to
do
that
now
and
she
noticed
the
trembling
of
his
hands
as
he
spread
the
manuscript
on
his
knees
he
had
always
been
nervous
in
approaching
the
subject
of
his
poems
and
she
said
to
herself
has
he
not
got
over
that
apparently
he
had
not
got
over
it
for
he
sat
there
for
several
perceptible
moments
sunk
in
the
low
chair
beside
her
saying
nothing
only
curling
and
uncurling
the
sheets
with
the
same
nervous
movement
of
his
hand
she
came
to
his
help
smiling
what
is
it
new
poems
no
i
do
think
i
can
call
them
new
i
wrote
them
four
or
five
years
ago
he
saw
that
some
of
the
gladness
died
out
of
her
face
and
he
wondered
why
were
you
going
to
read
them
to
me
good
heavens
no
he
laughed
the
short
laugh
she
had
heard
once
or
twice
before
that
always
sounded
like
a
sob
i
do
want
to
read
them
to
you
i
want
to
give
them
to
you
to
read
she
held
out
her
hand
yes
to
read
of
course
but
not
now
the
hand
was
withdrawn
evidently
with
some
distressing
consciousness
of
its
precipitancy
you
said
the
other
night
that
you
would
have
been
glad
to
know
that
you
had
done
something
for
me
and
somehow
i
believe
you
meant
it
i
did
indeed
if
you
read
these
things
you
will
know
there
no
other
way
in
which
i
could
tell
you
for
you
will
see
that
they
are
part
of
what
you
did
for
me
i
do
understand
you
will
though
when
you
read
them
that
he
said
meditatively
is
why
i
do
want
you
to
read
them
now
but
then
it
struck
him
that
he
had
blundered
introducing
a
passionate
personal
revelation
under
the
dangerous
veil
of
mystery
he
had
not
meant
to
say
what
you
have
done
for
me
was
to
make
me
love
you
but
i
have
done
a
great
thing
and
what
you
did
for
me
was
to
make
me
do
it
for
all
that
she
should
know
or
he
acknowledge
the
passion
was
the
means
not
the
end
i
do
want
to
be
cryptic
and
perhaps
i
ought
to
explain
a
little
i
meant
that
you
see
that
they
the
best
things
i
written
and
that
i
should
not
have
written
them
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
i
do
know
whether
you
forgive
me
for
writing
them
but
i
think
you
will
because
you
understand
that
i
had
to
have
you
published
any
of
them
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
question
was
dictated
by
a
sudden
fear
rather
not
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
that
later
on
when
read
them
when
will
you
want
them
back
i
do
want
them
back
at
all
i
brought
them
for
you
to
keep
to
keep
yes
if
you
care
for
them
but
this
is
the
original
manuscript
she
was
most
painfully
aware
of
the
value
of
the
thing
he
smiled
yes
i
could
give
you
a
copy
because
there
one
what
a
reckless
person
you
are
i
must
make
a
copy
then
and
keep
that
that
would
spoil
my
pleasure
and
my
gift
too
it
only
valuable
because
it
unique
whatever
it
is
it
sure
to
be
that
i
do
mean
in
that
way
altogether
he
hesitated
for
he
had
touched
a
part
of
his
subject
which
had
to
be
handled
gently
and
he
was
aware
that
in
handling
it
at
all
he
was
courting
rejection
of
the
gift
and
you
are
going
to
leave
it
with
me
now
yes
she
did
not
look
up
but
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
sheets
that
lay
in
her
lap
her
hands
lightly
covering
them
was
it
possible
that
her
had
caught
the
secret
of
the
page
beneath
them
and
that
their
delicate
nerves
had
already
carried
it
to
her
brain
was
she
considering
what
she
was
to
do
you
will
see
that
one
page
is
left
blank
i
could
fill
it
up
till
i
knew
whether
you
would
accept
the
dedication
i
she
looked
up
she
was
no
doubt
surprised
but
he
thought
he
could
read
something
in
her
look
that
was
deeper
and
sweeter
than
surprise
if
you
could
it
would
give
me
great
pleasure
it
the
only
acknowledgement
i
can
make
for
all
your
kindness
please
please
do
talk
of
my
kindness
i
wo
if
it
were
any
other
book
it
might
be
merely
a
question
of
acknowledgement
but
this
book
belongs
to
you
are
you
quite
sure
she
was
about
to
question
his
right
to
offer
it
which
was
as
good
as
questioning
his
honour
as
good
as
assuming
that
she
paused
horrified
as
she
realized
what
it
was
that
she
had
almost
assumed
kitty
had
often
told
her
that
she
erred
through
excess
of
subtlety
it
would
have
mattered
with
anybody
less
subtle
than
keith
rickman
but
he
would
see
it
all
he
did
quite
sure
that
i
ought
to
offer
it
to
anybody
else
i
am
quite
sure
it
was
written
four
years
ago
before
before
i
knew
anybody
else
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
anybody
else
it
could
have
been
dedicated
to
anybody
else
if
you
do
accept
it
but
i
do
her
eagerness
was
the
natural
recoil
from
her
hesitation
she
was
so
anxious
to
atone
for
that
shocking
blunder
she
had
made
i
say
how
you
do
take
things
on
trust
some
things
but
you
must
you
ca
accept
the
dedication
of
a
book
you
have
read
do
you
know
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
you
always
taken
me
on
trust
do
you
remember
when
first
i
came
to
you
it
more
than
five
years
ago
you
took
me
on
trust
then
their
talk
had
a
way
of
running
to
this
refrain
of
you
remember
do
you
remember
how
you
said
i
must
risk
it
yes
i
remember
how
i
insisted
on
keeping
you
and
how
very
unwilling
you
were
to
be
kept
do
you
mind
telling
me
what
made
you
want
to
keep
me
you
did
know
me
in
the
least
you
know
i
wanted
to
keep
you
you
did
want
to
stay
i
knew
then
that
i
could
trust
you
but
i
confess
that
most
people
might
not
have
seen
it
in
that
way
well
i
ca
let
you
take
these
sonnets
on
trust
for
this
time
your
principle
does
apply
you
see
you
ca
say
you
accepting
this
dedication
because
i
do
want
to
give
it
to
you
though
he
laughed
he
rose
and
backed
towards
the
door
suddenly
anxious
to
be
gone
is
it
enough
that
i
want
to
accept
it
he
shook
his
head
still
backing
and
at
the
door
he
paused
to
speak
you
accepted
nothing
as
yet
of
course
she
said
to
herself
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
have
read
them
first
but
i
can
trust
him
but
as
she
was
about
to
read
them
a
knock
a
familiar
knock
at
the
door
interrupted
her
kitty
she
laid
the
manuscript
hastily
aside
well
out
of
kitty
roving
sight
she
had
noticed
how
his
hands
had
trembled
as
he
brought
it
she
did
not
notice
that
her
own
shook
a
little
in
thus
putting
it
away
from
her
kitty
palliser
up
in
town
for
a
week
had
come
less
on
her
own
account
than
as
an
impetuous
ambassador
from
the
now
frantic
edith
she
too
was
prepared
to
move
heaven
and
earth
if
only
she
could
snatch
her
lucy
from
tavistock
place
but
her
anxiety
was
not
wholly
on
lucia
account
as
presently
appeared
how
can
you
stand
it
for
a
minute
said
she
i
standing
it
very
well
indeed
but
what
on
earth
do
you
find
to
do
all
day
long
when
said
kitty
severely
you
talking
to
young
rickman
all
day
long
i
go
out
or
lie
down
and
read
or
talk
to
sophie
and
in
the
evenings
in
the
evenings
sometimes
i
make
an
old
man
happy
by
playing
and
i
expect
you
making
a
young
man
unhappy
by
playing
too
a
very
dangerous
game
kitty
that
young
man
is
perfectly
happy
he
going
to
be
married
all
the
worse
then
you
make
a
young
woman
unhappy
as
well
this
little
game
would
be
dangerous
enough
with
a
man
of
your
own
set
it
is
fair
to
play
it
with
him
lucy
when
you
know
the
rules
and
he
does
i
assure
you
kitty
he
knows
them
as
well
as
you
or
i
do
better
i
doubt
it
kitty
eyes
roamed
round
the
room
they
had
not
lost
their
alert
and
hungry
look
and
they
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
that
move
in
the
game
would
never
have
been
made
if
he
had
known
the
rules
how
could
she
let
him
make
it
really
lucy
for
a
nice
woman
you
do
the
queerest
things
and
really
kitty
for
a
clever
woman
you
say
the
stupidest
getting
like
edith
i
am
not
like
edith
i
only
say
stupid
things
she
thinks
them
what
more
in
thinking
them
she
only
thinks
of
herself
and
her
precious
family
i
thinking
of
you
dear
and
kitty
voice
grew
soft
and
of
him
you
ought
to
think
of
him
a
little
too
i
think
of
him
i
been
thinking
of
him
all
the
time
i
know
you
have
but
do
let
him
suffer
because
of
the
insanely
beautiful
way
you
have
of
thinking
there
was
a
pause
in
which
it
was
evident
to
kitty
that
lucia
was
thinking
deeply
and
beautifully
too
have
i
made
him
suffer
i
afraid
i
did
once
he
was
valuable
and
i
damaged
him
yes
and
ever
since
you
been
trying
to
put
him
together
again
in
your
own
way
not
his
that
fatal
lucia
shook
her
head
and
followed
her
own
train
of
thought
kitty
to
be
perfectly
honest
i
think
i
not
sure
but
i
think
from
something
he
said
that
you
were
right
about
him
once
i
mean
about
his
beginning
to
care
too
much
i
afraid
it
was
so
at
harmouth
towards
the
end
but
it
is
so
any
more
he
tried
to
tell
me
just
now
he
did
it
beautifully
as
if
he
knew
that
that
would
make
me
happier
at
least
i
think
that
what
he
meant
he
did
say
much
but
i
sure
he
was
thinking
about
his
marriage
heaven
help
his
wife
then
if
he
got
as
far
as
that
i
suppose
you
take
a
beautiful
view
of
her
too
drop
it
for
goodness
sake
drop
it
not
i
it
would
mean
dropping
him
it
all
right
kitty
you
know
the
ways
of
poets
perhaps
not
but
i
know
the
ways
of
men
though
kitty
had
not
accomplished
her
mission
she
so
far
prevailed
that
she
carried
her
lucy
off
to
dinner
it
was
somewhere
towards
midnight
when
all
the
house
was
quiet
that
lucia
first
looked
into
keith
rickman
sonnets
she
had
been
led
to
expect
something
in
the
nature
of
a
personal
revelation
and
the
first
sonnet
struck
the
gave
her
the
clue
i
asked
the
priests
who
never
tire
in
love
high
service
who
behold
their
bliss
through
golden
gloom
of
love
dread
mysteries
what
heaven
there
be
for
earth
foregone
desire
and
they
kept
silence
but
the
gentle
choir
who
sing
love
praises
answered
me
there
is
no
voice
to
speak
of
these
deep
sanctities
for
love
hath
sealed
his
servants
lips
with
fire
yet
in
his
faithfulness
put
thou
thy
faith
though
he
hath
bound
thee
in
the
house
of
pain
and
given
thy
body
to
the
scourging
years
and
brought
thee
for
thy
thirst
the
drink
of
tears
that
sorrowing
thou
shouldst
serve
him
unto
death
for
when
love
reigneth
all
his
saints
shall
reign
she
kindled
and
flamed
her
whole
being
one
inspired
and
burning
sympathy
she
knew
what
it
was
all
about
she
was
on
the
track
of
a
poet
progress
in
quest
of
the
beloved
perfection
beauty
and
truth
in
one
of
those
nine
and
twenty
sonnets
she
looked
for
a
score
that
should
make
immortal
the
moments
of
triumph
and
of
vision
the
moments
of
rapture
and
fulfilment
of
the
heart
desire
her
glance
fell
now
on
two
lines
that
clearly
pointed
to
the
goal
of
those
who
travel
on
the
divine
way
elysian
calm
and
passion
with
no
stain
of
mortal
tears
no
touch
of
mortal
pain
she
hoped
he
had
reached
it
and
more
than
that
she
hoped
she
was
ignorant
of
what
his
life
had
been
before
he
knew
her
but
the
of
had
made
her
realize
that
besides
this
way
where
the
poet
went
invincibly
there
was
another
where
the
man
desired
to
go
where
as
they
were
so
ready
to
tell
her
he
had
not
always
gone
but
that
was
before
she
knew
him
she
hoped
taking
her
beautiful
view
that
in
this
gift
of
his
he
had
meant
to
give
to
her
who
understood
him
some
hint
or
sign
that
he
had
come
near
it
also
the
way
of
righteousness
she
looked
to
find
many
sonnets
dealing
with
these
secret
matters
of
the
soul
therefore
she
approached
them
fearlessly
since
she
knew
what
they
were
all
about
and
since
in
that
curious
humility
of
the
man
that
went
so
oddly
with
the
poet
pride
he
had
so
exaggerated
his
obligation
taking
as
he
said
the
will
for
the
deed
and
making
of
her
desire
to
serve
him
a
service
actually
done
since
his
imagination
had
played
round
her
for
a
moment
as
it
played
round
all
things
transforming
magnifying
glorifying
she
might
perhaps
find
one
sonnet
of
dedication
to
her
who
had
understood
him
but
when
she
had
read
them
all
she
saw
and
could
not
help
seeing
that
the
whole
nine
and
twenty
were
one
continuous
dedication
and
to
her
if
she
had
found
what
she
looked
for
she
found
also
that
a
revelation
had
been
made
to
her
of
things
even
more
sacred
more
personal
a
revelation
that
was
in
its
way
unique
he
had
hidden
nothing
kept
back
nothing
not
one
moment
of
that
passion
for
so
she
dated
it
it
was
all
laid
before
her
as
it
had
been
all
its
immortal
splendour
and
all
its
mortal
suffering
and
its
shame
not
a
line
if
she
could
have
stayed
to
think
of
that
not
a
word
that
could
offend
her
taste
or
hurt
her
pride
the
thing
was
perfect
she
understood
why
it
had
been
shown
to
her
she
understood
that
he
wanted
to
tell
her
that
he
had
loved
her
she
understood
that
he
never
would
have
told
her
if
it
had
not
been
all
over
it
was
because
it
was
all
over
that
he
had
brought
her
this
to
show
her
how
great
a
thing
she
had
done
for
him
she
who
thought
she
had
done
nothing
as
she
locked
the
sonnets
away
in
a
safe
place
for
the
night
in
her
heart
there
was
a
great
pride
and
a
still
greater
thankfulness
and
joy
joy
because
it
was
all
over
pride
because
it
had
once
been
and
thankfulness
because
it
had
been
given
her
to
know
and
in
his
room
behind
the
wall
that
separated
them
the
poet
walked
up
and
down
tortured
by
suspense
and
said
to
himself
over
and
over
again
i
wonder
how
she
take
it
chapter
lx
that
was
on
a
thursday
it
had
been
arranged
earlier
in
the
week
that
flossie
and
he
were
to
dine
with
lucia
on
friday
evening
on
saturday
and
sunday
the
beaver
would
be
let
loose
and
would
claim
him
for
her
own
he
could
not
hope
to
see
lucia
alone
before
monday
evening
his
suspense
then
would
have
to
endure
for
the
better
part
of
four
days
he
had
nothing
to
hope
for
from
friday
evening
lucia
manner
was
too
perfect
to
afford
any
clue
as
to
how
she
had
taken
it
if
she
were
offended
she
would
hardly
let
him
see
it
before
flossie
and
miss
roots
if
she
accepted
there
again
the
occasion
forbade
her
to
give
any
sign
to
one
of
her
guests
that
should
exclude
the
other
two
still
it
was
just
possible
that
he
might
gather
something
from
her
silence
but
as
it
happened
he
had
not
even
that
to
go
upon
never
had
lucia
been
less
silent
than
on
friday
night
not
that
she
talked
more
than
usual
but
that
all
her
looks
all
her
gestures
spoke
they
spoke
of
her
pleasure
in
the
happiness
of
her
friend
of
tenderness
to
the
little
woman
whom
he
loved
so
little
and
he
so
great
of
love
that
embraced
them
both
the
great
and
the
little
a
large
understanding
love
that
was
light
and
warmth
in
one
for
lucia
believed
firmly
that
she
understood
she
had
always
desired
him
to
be
happy
to
be
reconciled
to
the
beautiful
and
glorious
world
she
had
tried
to
bring
about
that
reconciliation
and
she
conceived
herself
to
have
failed
and
now
because
the
thing
had
been
done
so
beautifully
so
perfectly
if
a
little
unexpectedly
by
somebody
else
because
she
was
relieved
of
all
anxiety
and
responsibility
lucia
was
rejoicing
with
all
her
heart
he
had
not
been
five
minutes
in
the
room
before
he
saw
it
all
lucia
believed
that
it
was
all
over
and
was
letting
herself
go
carried
away
by
the
spectacle
of
a
supreme
and
triumphal
happiness
she
triumphed
too
her
eyes
when
they
looked
at
him
seemed
to
be
saying
did
i
tell
you
so
he
saw
why
they
had
been
asked
to
dinner
the
spirit
of
the
bridal
hour
was
upon
her
and
she
had
made
a
little
feast
to
celebrate
it
like
everything
she
did
it
was
simple
and
beautiful
and
exquisite
of
its
kind
and
yet
it
was
not
with
that
immaculate
white
linen
cloth
spread
on
keith
strewn
with
slender
green
foliage
and
set
out
with
delicate
food
and
fruit
and
wine
nor
with
those
white
flowers
nor
with
those
six
shaded
candles
that
she
had
worked
the
joyous
tender
charm
these
things
in
her
hands
and
in
his
eyes
became
sacramental
symbolic
of
lucia
soul
with
its
pure
thoughts
and
beautiful
beliefs
its
inspired
and
burning
charities
and
the
hero
of
this
feast
of
happiness
sat
at
her
right
hand
facing
his
little
a
miserable
man
consumed
with
anguish
and
remorse
he
had
never
had
so
painful
a
sense
of
the
pathos
of
his
beaver
for
if
anybody
was
happy
it
was
she
flossie
was
aware
that
it
was
her
hour
and
that
high
honour
was
being
paid
to
her
moreover
he
could
see
for
the
moment
that
the
worm
had
ceased
to
gnaw
and
that
she
had
become
the
almost
affectionate
thrall
of
the
lady
whose
motto
was
she
had
been
forced
poor
little
girl
to
anticipate
her
trousseau
in
order
to
attire
herself
fitly
for
the
occasion
and
was
looking
remarkably
pretty
in
her
way
she
sat
very
upright
and
all
her
demeanour
was
irreproachably
modest
quiet
and
demure
nothing
could
have
been
more
correct
than
her
smile
frequent
but
so
diminutive
that
it
just
lifted
her
upper
lip
and
no
more
no
insight
no
foreboding
troubled
her
her
face
soft
and
golden
white
in
the
candlelight
expressed
a
shy
and
delicate
content
for
flossie
was
a
little
materialist
through
and
through
her
smooth
and
over
feminine
body
seemed
to
have
grown
smoother
and
more
feminine
still
under
the
touch
of
pleasure
all
that
was
hard
and
immobile
in
her
melting
in
the
sense
of
it
was
not
merely
that
flossie
was
on
her
good
behaviour
his
imagination
in
league
with
his
conscience
suggested
that
the
poor
child
divinely
protected
by
the
righteousness
of
her
cause
was
inspired
to
confound
his
judgement
of
her
to
give
no
vantage
ground
to
his
disloyalty
to
throw
him
defenceless
on
his
own
remorse
or
was
it
lucia
who
inspired
her
lucia
whose
loving
spirit
could
create
the
thing
it
loved
whose
sweetness
was
of
so
fine
and
piercing
a
quality
that
what
it
touched
it
penetrated
he
could
not
tell
but
he
thanked
heaven
that
at
least
for
this
hour
which
was
hers
the
little
thing
was
happy
he
for
his
part
by
unprecedented
acts
of
subterfuge
and
hypocrisy
endeavoured
to
conceal
his
agony
miss
roots
alone
divined
it
beyond
looking
festive
in
a
black
silk
gown
and
a
kind
of
white
satin
waistcoat
that
clever
lady
took
a
strained
and
awkward
part
in
the
rejoicing
he
was
inclined
to
think
that
the
waistcoat
committed
her
to
severity
until
he
became
aware
that
she
was
watching
him
with
a
furtive
sympathy
in
the
clever
eyes
that
saw
through
his
pitiful
play
how
was
it
that
lucia
she
who
once
understood
him
could
not
divine
him
too
from
this
estranging
mood
he
was
roused
by
the
innocent
laughter
of
the
beaver
he
was
aware
of
certain
thin
and
melancholy
sounds
that
floated
up
from
some
room
below
they
struggled
with
the
noises
of
the
street
overcame
and
rose
strident
and
triumphant
to
invade
the
feast
they
seemed
to
him
in
perfect
keeping
with
the
misery
and
insanity
of
the
hour
it
was
partridge
playing
on
his
flute
miss
roots
looked
at
lucia
that
you
lucy
you
been
talking
to
him
about
that
flute
i
suppose
you
told
him
you
would
love
to
hear
him
play
it
no
sophie
i
did
tell
him
that
but
lucy
looked
a
little
guilty
the
flute
rose
as
if
in
passionate
protest
against
her
denial
it
seemed
to
say
you
did
you
know
you
did
i
only
said
it
was
a
pity
he
given
it
up
and
i
meant
it
but
oh
and
lucy
put
her
hands
up
to
her
ears
i
do
mean
it
any
more
that
comes
said
rickman
of
taking
things
on
trust
she
smiled
and
shook
her
head
it
was
her
first
approach
to
a
sign
of
reassurance
that
the
sort
of
thing
she
always
doing
it
does
matter
for
you
lucy
you
wo
have
to
stay
on
and
hear
him
i
do
know
i
think
i
shall
stay
on
you
see
rickman
i
part
with
this
pretty
room
do
you
like
it
i
like
it
very
much
indeed
you
all
coming
to
dine
with
me
here
again
some
day
and
you
must
come
and
dine
with
us
miss
harden
when
we
got
settled
it
was
flossie
who
spoke
i
shall
be
delighted
he
looked
up
surprised
he
could
not
have
believed
the
beaver
could
have
done
it
so
prettily
he
had
not
even
realized
that
it
could
be
done
at
all
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
his
marriage
could
bring
him
nearer
to
lucia
harden
he
looked
kindly
at
the
beaver
and
blessed
her
for
that
thought
and
then
a
thought
bolder
than
the
beaver
came
to
him
i
hope
he
said
you
do
more
than
that
you
must
come
and
stay
with
us
in
the
summer
you
shall
sit
out
in
a
in
the
garden
all
day
that
the
way
to
get
strong
then
he
remembered
that
she
could
do
that
just
as
well
in
someone
else
garden
up
at
hampstead
and
he
looked
shy
and
anxious
as
he
added
will
you
come
of
course
i
come
said
she
he
saw
her
going
through
the
house
at
ealing
and
sitting
in
the
little
green
garden
with
the
lilac
bushes
about
her
all
in
flower
and
at
the
thought
of
her
coming
he
was
profoundly
moved
his
eyes
moistened
and
under
the
table
his
knees
shook
violently
with
the
agitation
of
his
nerves
miss
roots
gave
one
queer
little
glance
at
him
and
another
at
flossie
and
the
moment
passed
and
lucia
had
not
divined
it
no
not
for
a
moment
not
even
in
the
moment
of
she
was
still
holding
flossie
hand
in
hers
when
her
eyes
met
his
kind
eyes
that
were
still
saying
almost
triumphantly
i
told
you
so
as
she
dropped
flossie
hand
for
his
she
answered
the
question
that
he
had
not
dared
to
ask
i
read
them
she
said
and
there
was
no
diminution
in
her
glad
look
when
may
i
see
you
can
you
any
time
after
four
chapter
lxi
he
came
into
lucia
presence
with
a
sense
of
doing
something
voluntary
and
yet
inevitable
something
sanctioned
and
foreappointed
a
sense
of
carrying
on
a
thing
already
begun
of
returning
through
a
door
that
had
never
been
shut
to
the
life
wherein
alone
he
knew
himself
and
yet
this
life
measured
by
days
and
hours
and
counting
their
times
of
meeting
only
ran
hardly
to
six
weeks
since
times
and
places
were
of
no
account
he
might
have
been
coming
as
he
came
five
years
ago
to
hear
her
judgement
on
his
drama
strange
and
great
things
had
happened
to
his
genius
since
that
day
between
in
and
the
nine
and
twenty
sonnets
there
lay
the
newly
discovered
heavenly
countries
of
the
soul
well
he
said
glancing
at
the
poems
as
he
seated
himself
what
do
you
think
of
them
am
i
forgiven
do
you
consent
so
many
questions
they
all
answered
are
they
if
i
say
i
consent
and
do
you
there
was
acute
anxiety
in
his
voice
and
eyes
it
struck
her
as
painful
that
the
man
whom
she
was
beginning
to
look
on
as
possibly
the
greatest
poet
of
his
age
should
think
it
necessary
to
plead
to
her
for
such
a
little
thing
i
do
indeed
without
reservations
what
reservations
should
there
be
of
course
i
could
only
be
glad
and
proud
that
you
should
do
me
so
much
honour
if
i
ca
say
very
much
about
it
do
think
i
do
feel
it
i
feel
it
more
than
i
can
say
do
you
really
mean
it
i
was
afraid
that
it
might
offend
you
or
that
you
think
i
ought
to
have
written
the
things
or
at
any
rate
that
i
no
business
to
show
them
to
you
and
as
for
the
dedication
i
could
tell
how
you
feel
about
that
and
she
having
before
her
eyes
the
greatness
of
his
genius
was
troubled
by
the
humility
and
hesitation
of
his
approach
it
recalled
to
her
the
ways
of
his
pathetic
youth
his
youth
that
obscurity
made
wild
and
shy
and
unassured
i
ca
tell
either
she
replied
i
do
know
whether
i
ought
to
feel
proud
or
humble
about
it
but
i
think
i
feel
both
your
wanting
to
dedicate
anything
to
me
would
have
been
enough
to
make
me
very
proud
even
if
it
had
been
a
little
thing
but
this
thing
is
great
in
some
ways
it
seems
to
me
the
greatest
thing
you
done
yet
i
did
think
just
at
first
that
i
ought
perhaps
to
refuse
because
of
that
and
then
i
saw
that
really
that
was
what
made
it
easy
for
me
to
accept
it
so
great
that
the
dedication
does
count
but
it
count
it
the
only
thing
that
counts
to
me
you
take
it
like
that
and
separate
it
from
the
rest
those
sonnets
would
still
be
dedicated
to
you
even
if
you
refused
to
let
me
write
your
name
before
them
i
want
you
to
see
that
they
the
dedication
lucia
shook
her
head
she
had
seen
it
she
could
see
nothing
else
when
she
read
them
how
was
it
that
the
poet
bodily
presence
made
her
inclined
to
ignore
the
reference
to
herself
to
take
these
poems
dedicated
to
her
as
an
event
not
in
her
life
or
his
but
in
the
history
of
literature
no
she
said
you
must
not
look
at
them
that
way
if
they
were
it
might
be
a
reason
for
refusing
i
know
most
people
would
think
less
right
to
accept
what
was
really
dedicated
to
them
but
you
see
it
just
because
it
is
really
dedicated
to
me
that
i
can
accept
it
but
it
is
no
not
to
me
you
would
be
so
great
a
poet
if
it
were
i
see
myself
here
but
i
see
you
and
your
idea
of
me
it
dedicated
to
that
dream
of
yours
did
i
tell
you
your
dream
was
divorced
from
reality
you
told
me
it
would
be
reconciled
to
it
and
it
is
is
it
and
the
reality
is
worth
all
the
dreams
that
ever
were
he
could
have
told
her
that
so
it
appeared
to
those
who
are
bound
in
the
house
of
bondage
but
that
in
leuce
the
country
of
deliverance
the
dream
and
the
reality
are
indivisible
being
both
divine
he
could
have
told
her
that
he
had
known
as
much
five
years
ago
even
before
he
knew
her
after
all
he
said
that
admitting
that
they
divided
and
that
if
you
remember
was
what
i
said
not
what
you
said
lucia
evaded
the
issue
in
a
fashion
truly
feminine
it
does
matter
a
bit
what
either
of
us
said
then
so
long
as
know
now
there
one
thing
i
do
know
i
do
know
how
you
really
take
it
or
whether
you
will
really
understand
just
now
i
thought
you
did
but
after
all
it
seems
you
do
you
think
i
only
trying
to
pay
you
a
stupid
literary
compliment
you
think
when
i
wrote
those
things
i
did
mean
them
my
imagination
was
simply
taking
a
rather
more
eccentric
flight
than
usual
is
that
so
i
certainly
allowing
for
your
imagination
i
ca
forget
that
you
are
a
poet
you
wo
let
me
forget
it
i
ca
separate
your
genius
from
the
rest
of
you
and
i
ca
separate
the
rest
of
me
from
it
that
makes
the
difference
you
see
he
was
angry
as
he
said
that
he
had
wondered
whether
she
would
deal
as
tenderly
with
his
passion
as
she
had
dealt
with
his
dream
and
she
had
dealt
just
as
tenderly
but
it
was
because
she
identified
the
passion
with
the
dream
he
had
not
been
prepared
for
that
view
of
it
and
somehow
it
annoyed
him
but
for
that
he
would
never
have
spoken
as
he
now
did
when
i
wondered
how
you
would
take
it
i
thought
it
might
possibly
strike
you
as
something
rather
too
real
almost
offensively
so
do
you
know
i
rather
you
taken
it
that
way
than
that
you
should
talk
about
my
dreams
my
it
was
shocking
the
violent
emphasis
of
disgust
the
poet
the
dreamer
flung
into
that
one
word
as
if
i
dreamed
that
i
knew
you
as
if
i
dreamed
that
i
cared
for
you
would
you
rather
think
i
dreamed
it
you
can
if
you
like
or
would
you
rather
think
it
was
the
most
real
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
so
real
that
after
it
happened
it
happened
i
left
off
being
the
sort
of
man
and
the
sort
of
poet
i
was
and
became
another
sort
so
real
and
so
strong
that
it
saved
me
from
one
or
two
other
things
uncommonly
strong
and
real
that
had
got
a
pretty
tight
hold
of
me
too
would
you
rather
think
that
really
done
this
for
me
or
that
i
dreamed
it
all
she
looked
at
his
face
the
unforgotten
unforgetable
face
which
when
she
first
knew
it
had
kindled
and
darkened
so
swiftly
and
inexplicably
she
knew
it
now
she
held
the
key
of
all
its
mysteries
it
was
the
face
that
had
turned
to
her
five
years
ago
with
just
that
look
in
the
mouth
and
lifted
chin
that
imperious
impetuous
determination
to
make
her
see
in
the
eyes
that
pathetic
trust
in
her
seeing
the
same
face
and
yet
it
would
have
told
her
if
he
had
not
that
he
was
another
man
no
not
another
man
but
of
all
the
ways
that
were
then
open
to
him
to
take
he
had
chosen
the
noblest
and
so
of
all
the
expressions
that
in
its
youth
had
played
on
that
singularly
expressive
face
it
was
the
finest
only
that
had
become
dominant
that
face
had
never
lied
to
her
why
should
he
not
plead
for
the
sincerity
of
his
passion
since
it
was
all
over
now
was
it
possible
that
there
was
some
secret
insincerity
in
her
how
was
it
that
she
had
made
him
think
that
she
desired
to
ignore
to
repudiate
her
part
in
him
that
she
preferred
a
meaningless
compliment
to
the
confession
which
was
the
highest
honour
that
could
be
paid
to
any
woman
was
it
because
the
honour
was
so
great
that
she
was
afraid
to
take
it
of
course
i
would
rather
think
it
was
really
so
then
you
must
believe
that
i
really
cared
for
you
and
that
it
is
only
because
i
cared
that
it
is
really
so
i
do
believe
it
but
i
ca
take
it
all
to
myself
another
person
might
have
cared
just
as
much
and
it
might
have
done
him
harm
i
would
never
have
forgiven
myself
if
i
had
done
you
harm
i
want
you
to
see
that
it
was
anything
in
it
was
something
in
that
made
the
difference
he
smiled
sadly
you
know
it
sound
as
if
you
wanted
to
keep
out
of
it
does
it
if
i
had
really
been
in
it
do
you
think
that
i
would
be
glad
and
thankful
i
am
even
for
the
little
that
i
have
done
even
though
i
know
another
woman
might
have
done
as
much
or
more
i
glad
i
was
the
one
but
you
see
i
did
know
i
was
in
it
at
all
i
did
know
the
sort
of
help
you
wanted
perhaps
if
i
had
known
i
could
have
helped
you
but
my
knowing
or
not
knowing
does
matter
one
bit
if
i
help
you
that
way
i
helped
some
one
else
too
at
least
i
should
like
to
think
i
did
i
should
like
to
think
that
one
reason
why
you
care
for
your
wife
so
much
is
because
you
cared
a
little
for
me
there
is
that
way
of
looking
at
it
then
lest
she
should
seem
to
be
seeking
some
extraneous
justification
of
a
fact
that
in
her
heart
she
abhorred
she
added
every
way
i
look
at
it
glad
i
glad
that
you
cared
i
glad
because
it
been
and
glad
because
it
over
for
if
it
had
been
over
what
were
you
going
to
say
i
was
going
to
say
that
if
it
had
been
over
you
could
have
given
me
these
i
did
say
it
because
it
would
have
sounded
as
if
that
were
all
i
cared
about
as
if
i
would
have
been
almost
as
glad
if
you
never
written
a
line
of
them
only
in
that
case
i
should
never
have
known
no
you
would
never
have
known
i
think
i
should
have
been
glad
even
if
the
poems
had
been
not
very
good
poems
you
would
have
known
in
that
case
either
i
would
have
shown
them
to
you
if
they
had
not
been
good
as
it
is
when
i
wrote
them
i
never
meant
to
show
them
to
you
oh
but
i
think
of
course
you
do
but
i
was
going
to
print
them
before
you
seen
them
do
you
know
what
i
meant
to
do
with
them
what
in
fact
i
do
with
them
i
left
them
to
you
in
my
will
with
directions
that
they
were
to
be
published
without
your
consent
it
seems
a
rather
unusual
bequest
but
you
know
i
had
a
conceited
hope
that
some
time
they
might
be
valuable
i
do
know
whether
they
would
have
sold
for
three
thousand
pounds
i
admit
it
was
a
draft
on
posterity
that
posterity
might
have
dishonoured
but
i
thought
they
might
possibly
go
a
little
way
towards
paying
my
debt
your
debt
i
do
understand
but
the
trembling
of
her
mouth
belied
its
words
do
you
do
you
remember
no
i
do
i
never
remembered
probably
not
but
you
can
hardly
suppose
that
i
forgotten
it
what
has
it
to
do
with
you
or
me
or
this
not
much
perhaps
but
still
something
you
admit
i
admit
nothing
i
ca
bear
your
ever
having
thought
of
it
i
wish
you
had
told
me
it
spoils
everything
does
it
such
a
little
thing
surely
a
friend
might
be
allowed
to
leave
you
a
small
legacy
when
he
was
decently
dead
and
it
fault
was
it
if
it
paid
a
debt
as
well
the
tears
rose
in
her
eyes
to
answer
him
but
you
see
i
did
leave
it
i
did
wait
for
that
i
was
afraid
that
my
being
dead
would
put
you
in
a
more
embarrassing
position
than
if
i
been
alive
you
might
have
hated
those
poems
and
yet
you
might
have
shrunk
from
suppressing
them
for
fear
of
wounding
the
immortal
vanity
of
a
blessed
spirit
or
you
might
have
taken
that
horrid
literary
view
i
implored
you
not
to
take
you
might
have
hesitated
to
inflict
so
great
a
loss
on
the
literature
of
your
country
he
tried
to
speak
lightly
as
if
it
were
merely
a
whimsical
and
extravagant
notion
that
he
should
be
reckoned
among
the
poets
and
yet
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
it
must
be
so
but
now
the
things
ca
be
published
unless
you
will
accept
them
as
they
were
originally
meant
there
nothing
gross
about
the
transaction
nothing
that
need
offend
either
you
or
me
i
ca
i
ca
well
he
said
gently
fearing
the
appearance
of
grossness
in
pressing
the
question
we
can
settle
that
afterwards
ca
we
meanwhile
at
all
events
the
publication
rests
with
you
the
publication
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
me
the
dedication
you
accepted
that
still
you
might
object
to
your
name
appearing
before
the
public
with
mine
lucia
looked
bewildered
she
thought
she
had
followed
him
in
all
his
subtleties
but
she
had
had
difficulty
in
realizing
that
he
was
actually
proposing
to
suppress
his
poems
in
deference
to
her
scruples
if
she
had
any
some
shadowy
notion
of
his
meaning
was
penetrating
her
now
my
name
she
said
will
mean
nothing
to
the
public
then
you
consent
of
course
it
absurd
to
talk
about
my
consent
besides
why
should
i
mind
now
when
it
is
all
over
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
by
an
effort
as
if
he
unwillingly
obeyed
some
superior
constraint
if
it
been
all
over
would
you
have
minded
then
would
you
have
refused
your
consent
to
your
publishing
your
own
poems
how
could
i
to
the
dedication
i
mean
if
it
had
been
all
over
would
you
have
given
your
consent
to
that
his
anxiety
had
deepened
to
an
agony
which
seemed
to
have
made
his
face
grow
sharp
and
thin
almost
as
she
looked
at
him
she
judged
that
this
question
was
vital
and
that
the
truth
was
required
of
her
no
not
to
that
you
see
it
only
because
it
all
over
that
consented
now
i
see
that
the
condition
you
would
never
have
consented
but
for
that
why
should
we
talk
about
that
now
i
wanted
to
know
the
truth
why
should
you
it
a
truth
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
things
as
they
are
only
with
things
as
they
might
have
been
is
it
enough
to
be
glad
that
they
were
that
it
is
all
over
and
that
this
is
the
end
of
it
even
as
she
said
the
words
it
struck
her
that
there
was
something
ominous
in
this
reiteration
but
it
is
all
over
this
is
the
end
of
it
his
voice
was
so
low
that
she
could
hardly
have
heard
it
but
for
the
intense
vibration
of
the
tones
there
was
a
pause
in
which
they
seemed
still
to
be
throbbing
but
with
no
meaning
behind
the
passionate
pulse
of
sound
i
did
mean
to
tell
you
i
know
you
rather
think
it
was
so
and
i
would
have
let
you
think
it
if
it
had
been
for
what
you
told
me
what
i
made
you
tell
me
i
do
understand
what
did
i
tell
you
you
told
me
the
truth
he
spoke
with
a
sudden
savage
energy
how
could
i
go
on
lying
after
that
she
looked
at
him
with
that
almost
imperceptible
twitching
of
her
soft
mouth
which
he
knew
to
be
a
sign
of
suffering
and
in
her
eyes
there
was
pain
and
a
vague
terror
i
might
have
gone
on
lying
to
the
end
if
nothing
had
depended
on
it
but
if
you
tell
me
that
you
only
give
your
consent
to
a
thing
on
one
condition
and
i
know
that
i
ca
possibly
fulfil
the
condition
what
am
i
to
do
say
nothing
about
it
and
do
what
you
would
loathe
me
for
doing
if
you
knew
till
now
she
had
left
the
manuscript
lying
in
her
lap
where
unconsciously
her
hands
covered
it
with
a
gentle
protecting
touch
but
as
he
spoke
she
took
it
up
and
put
it
away
from
her
with
an
irresistible
impulse
of
rejection
he
knew
that
he
was
answered
if
i
had
he
said
in
one
sense
i
should
have
done
you
no
wrong
all
this
would
be
nothing
to
the
world
which
would
read
these
poems
but
when
i
knew
that
it
made
all
the
difference
to
she
turned
as
he
had
seen
her
turn
once
and
only
once
before
in
reproach
that
was
almost
anger
to
me
do
you
suppose
i
thinking
of
myself
perhaps
not
that
does
prevent
my
thinking
of
you
but
i
was
thinking
of
myself
too
supposing
i
had
done
this
thing
that
you
would
have
loathed
even
though
you
had
never
known
it
i
should
have
felt
that
i
had
betrayed
your
trust
that
i
had
taken
something
from
you
that
i
had
no
right
to
take
something
that
you
would
never
have
given
me
if
you
had
known
what
was
i
to
do
she
did
not
answer
him
once
before
he
remembered
when
his
honour
was
in
difficulties
she
had
refused
to
help
it
out
left
it
to
struggle
to
the
light
which
was
what
it
did
now
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
said
nothing
and
done
nothing
he
expected
her
to
close
instantly
with
that
view
of
his
behaviour
which
honour
had
presented
as
the
final
one
but
this
she
did
not
do
if
you
had
said
nothing
you
might
have
done
what
you
liked
i
see
it
my
saying
it
that
makes
the
difference
that
is
what
i
meant
i
meant
that
you
were
free
to
publish
what
you
have
written
you
are
not
free
to
say
these
things
to
me
for
the
life
of
me
i
do
know
why
i
said
them
it
means
perdition
for
my
poems
and
for
me
i
knew
that
was
all
i
had
to
gain
by
telling
you
the
truth
but
it
the
truth
you
know
it
is
you
do
even
think
it
is
and
if
it
were
would
it
be
so
terrible
to
you
to
hear
it
she
did
not
answer
she
only
looked
at
him
as
if
by
looking
she
could
read
the
truth
for
his
face
had
never
lied
he
persisted
if
it
were
true
what
would
you
think
of
me
i
should
think
it
most
dishonourable
of
you
to
say
so
but
it
true
he
smiled
therefore
it
ca
be
dishonourable
of
me
to
say
so
no
not
that
you
are
not
dishonourable
therefore
it
ca
be
true
let
us
forget
that
you
ever
said
it
but
i
ca
forget
that
it
true
any
more
than
i
can
make
it
untrue
you
think
me
dishonourable
because
you
think
i
changed
but
i
have
changed
it
always
was
so
ever
since
i
knew
you
and
more
than
five
years
ago
now
i
am
dishonourable
but
that
not
where
the
dishonour
comes
in
dishonourable
thing
would
have
been
to
have
left
off
caring
for
you
but
i
never
did
leave
off
there
never
was
a
minute
when
it
was
true
nor
a
minute
when
i
did
think
it
if
i
was
sure
of
nothing
else
i
was
always
sure
of
that
where
the
dishonour
came
in
was
in
caring
for
another
woman
in
another
way
the
dishonour
would
come
in
if
you
left
off
caring
for
her
and
you
have
done
that
it
would
come
in
a
little
now
i
think
if
you
said
that
you
did
care
but
you
do
say
it
you
do
even
think
it
shall
i
tell
you
the
truth
you
let
your
genius
get
too
strong
a
hold
over
you
you
let
it
get
hold
too
of
this
feeling
that
you
had
for
me
and
now
though
you
know
perfectly
well
as
well
as
i
do
that
it
all
over
your
genius
is
trying
to
persuade
you
that
the
feeling
is
still
there
when
it
is
that
is
not
so
but
you
can
say
it
is
if
it
makes
you
any
happier
it
does
make
me
happier
to
think
that
it
your
genius
not
you
that
says
these
things
for
i
can
forgive
your
genius
but
i
could
have
forgiven
you
at
that
moment
he
felt
a
savage
jealousy
of
his
genius
because
she
loved
it
and
yet
you
said
a
little
while
ago
you
could
separate
the
two
you
have
obliged
me
to
separate
them
to
find
an
excuse
for
you
this
ought
not
to
have
happened
but
it
could
not
have
happened
to
a
man
who
was
not
a
poet
all
the
time
she
was
miserably
aware
that
she
was
trying
to
defend
herself
with
subtleties
against
the
impact
of
a
terrible
reality
and
because
that
reality
must
weigh
more
heavily
on
him
than
her
she
was
trying
to
defend
him
too
against
himself
to
force
on
him
against
himself
her
own
subtilizing
justifying
view
but
his
subtlety
was
a
match
for
hers
your
cousin
once
did
me
the
honour
to
say
i
was
part
a
poet
and
upon
my
honour
i
prefer
his
estimate
to
yours
what
is
mine
that
i
nothing
but
a
poet
that
there
was
enough
of
me
left
over
to
make
a
man
that
is
not
my
estimate
and
you
know
it
i
think
you
so
much
a
man
that
your
heart
will
keep
you
right
even
though
your
genius
has
led
you
very
far
astray
is
that
all
you
know
about
it
well
i
not
sure
that
it
is
your
genius
this
time
i
rather
think
it
your
sense
of
honour
i
believe
you
think
that
because
you
once
cared
for
me
you
got
to
go
on
caring
lest
i
should
accuse
you
of
being
faithless
to
your
dream
surely
she
said
to
herself
made
it
easy
for
him
now
but
the
word
was
too
much
for
him
for
goodness
sake
do
talk
to
me
any
more
about
my
dream
you
may
think
any
mortal
thing
you
like
about
me
so
long
as
you
do
do
that
she
smiled
faintly
as
if
with
an
effort
at
forbearance
very
well
then
i
wo
talk
about
your
dream
i
say
you
were
afraid
lest
i
should
think
you
had
been
faithless
to
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
you
if
you
had
seen
me
again
it
will
not
occur
to
you
after
i
am
gone
it
will
be
all
over
by
why
he
spoke
stupidly
fear
had
made
him
stupid
why
because
i
am
going
then
he
knew
that
it
was
indeed
all
over
the
door
which
had
been
open
to
him
was
about
to
close
and
once
closed
it
would
never
be
open
to
him
again
what
you
think
of
me
i
think
you
have
done
very
wrong
and
that
our
talking
about
it
only
makes
it
worse
and
so
i
sorry
but
i
must
ask
you
to
leave
me
but
he
did
not
leave
her
and
i
must
ask
you
to
forgive
me
he
said
gently
i
i
have
nothing
to
forgive
you
have
done
anything
to
me
but
i
should
never
forgive
you
if
i
thought
this
foolishness
could
make
one
moment
difference
to
to
flossie
it
never
has
made
any
difference
to
her
he
replied
coldly
or
to
my
feeling
for
her
i
never
felt
towards
any
woman
as
i
feel
towards
you
it
is
the
same
thing
at
all
heaven
knows
i
thought
i
cared
enough
for
her
to
marry
her
but
it
seems
i
did
that
why
i
say
it
makes
no
difference
to
her
nothing
is
altered
by
it
as
far
as
flossie
is
concerned
whether
i
marry
her
or
not
i
shall
have
behaved
abominably
i
do
know
which
is
the
more
dishonourable
do
you
no
i
only
know
which
i
going
to
do
she
turned
her
head
away
and
that
turning
away
was
intolerable
it
was
the
closing
of
the
door
is
it
so
very
terrible
to
you
he
said
gently
he
could
not
see
the
tears
in
her
eyes
but
he
heard
them
in
her
voice
and
he
knew
that
he
had
wounded
her
hot
in
her
pride
but
in
her
tenderness
and
honour
lucia
honour
to
me
i
not
thinking
of
myself
not
of
myself
at
all
how
could
i
think
of
myself
i
thinking
of
she
turned
to
him
and
let
her
tears
gather
in
her
eyes
unheeded
do
you
see
what
you
done
oh
yes
he
saw
very
well
what
he
had
done
he
had
taken
the
friendship
she
had
given
to
him
to
last
his
life
and
destroyed
it
in
a
moment
with
his
own
hands
all
for
the
sake
of
a
subtlety
a
fantastic
scruple
a
question
asked
a
thing
said
under
some
obscure
compulsion
he
had
been
moved
by
he
knew
not
what
insane
urgency
of
honour
and
whatever
else
he
saw
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
have
done
otherwise
the
only
alternative
was
to
say
nothing
to
do
nothing
supposing
he
had
suppressed
both
his
passion
and
the
poems
that
immortalized
it
what
would
she
have
thought
of
him
then
would
she
not
have
thought
that
he
had
either
dedicated
to
her
a
thing
that
he
was
afterwards
ashamed
of
or
that
he
had
meant
nothing
by
the
dedication
do
you
see
what
you
have
done
she
said
you
made
me
wish
i
had
never
come
here
and
that
i
never
seen
you
again
it
was
only
the
other
night
the
dear
little
girl
she
came
up
here
and
sat
with
me
and
we
had
a
talk
we
talked
about
you
she
told
me
how
she
came
to
know
you
and
how
good
you
been
to
her
and
how
long
it
was
before
either
of
you
knew
she
told
me
things
about
herself
she
is
very
shy
very
reserved
but
she
let
me
see
how
much
she
cares
and
how
much
you
care
think
what
you
must
be
to
her
she
has
no
father
and
no
mother
she
has
nobody
but
you
she
told
me
that
and
then
she
took
me
up
to
her
room
and
showed
me
all
her
pretty
things
she
was
so
happy
and
how
can
i
look
at
her
again
she
would
hate
me
if
she
knew
and
i
could
blame
her
poor
child
she
could
never
understand
that
it
was
not
my
fault
but
as
she
said
it
her
conscience
rose
in
contradiction
and
told
her
that
it
was
her
fault
her
fault
in
the
very
beginning
for
drawing
him
into
an
intimacy
that
his
youth
and
inexperience
made
dangerous
her
fault
for
sacrificing
yes
sacrificing
him
to
that
impulse
to
give
pleasure
which
had
only
meant
giving
pleasure
to
herself
at
his
expense
her
fault
for
endlessly
refining
on
the
facts
of
life
till
she
lost
all
feeling
of
its
simpler
and
more
obvious
issues
kitty
had
been
right
when
she
told
her
that
she
treated
men
as
if
they
were
disembodied
spirits
she
had
trusted
too
much
to
her
own
subtlety
that
was
how
all
her
blunders
had
been
made
if
she
had
been
cold
as
well
as
subtle
but
lucia
was
capable
of
passionate
indiscreet
things
to
be
followed
by
torments
of
her
pride
her
pride
had
only
made
matters
worse
it
was
her
pride
in
the
beginning
that
had
blinded
her
when
she
had
told
kitty
that
she
was
not
the
sort
of
woman
to
let
this
sort
of
thing
happen
with
this
sort
of
man
she
had
summed
up
her
abiding
attitude
to
one
particular
possibility
she
had
trusted
to
the
social
gulf
to
keep
her
safe
apart
afterwards
she
knew
that
she
had
not
trusted
so
much
to
the
social
gulf
she
had
not
been
quite
so
proud
neither
since
kitty
had
opened
her
eyes
had
she
been
so
blind
but
she
had
been
ten
times
more
foolish
her
mind
had
refused
to
dwell
upon
kitty
dreadful
suggestions
because
they
were
dreadful
unconscious
of
her
sex
she
had
remained
unconscious
of
her
power
she
had
trusted
unconsciously
to
the
power
of
another
woman
for
protection
flossie
had
so
to
speak
detached
and
absorbed
the
passionate
part
of
keith
rickman
by
which
process
the
rest
of
him
was
left
subtler
and
more
pure
she
had
thought
she
could
really
deal
with
him
now
as
a
disembodied
spirit
and
so
under
the
shelter
of
his
engagement
she
had
after
her
own
manner
let
herself
go
these
thoughts
swept
through
her
brain
like
one
thought
as
she
contemplated
the
misery
she
had
made
they
came
with
the
surging
of
the
blood
in
her
cheeks
so
swiftly
that
she
had
no
time
to
see
that
they
hardly
exhausted
the
aspects
of
her
case
and
it
was
not
her
own
case
that
she
was
thinking
of
she
turned
to
him
pleading
do
you
see
that
i
could
never
forgive
myself
if
i
thought
that
i
had
hurt
her
you
are
not
going
to
make
me
so
unhappy
do
you
mean
am
i
going
to
marry
her
she
said
nothing
for
she
was
conscious
now
conscious
and
ashamed
of
using
a
power
that
she
had
no
right
to
have
ashamed
too
of
being
forced
to
acknowledge
the
truth
of
the
thing
she
had
so
passionately
denied
you
need
be
afraid
he
said
of
course
i
am
going
to
marry
her
he
turned
away
from
her
as
he
had
turned
away
five
years
ago
with
the
same
hopeless
sense
of
dishonour
and
defeat
she
called
him
back
as
she
had
called
him
back
five
years
ago
and
for
the
same
purpose
of
delivering
a
final
stab
only
that
this
time
she
knew
it
was
a
stab
and
her
own
heart
felt
the
pain
as
she
delivered
it
but
the
terrible
thing
had
to
be
done
she
had
got
to
return
the
manuscript
the
gift
that
should
never
have
been
given
she
gathered
the
loosened
sheets
tenderly
like
things
that
she
was
grieved
to
part
from
he
admitted
that
she
was
handling
her
sword
with
all
gentleness
so
as
to
avoid
as
far
as
possible
any
suggestion
of
a
thrust
you
must
take
them
back
she
said
i
ca
keep
them
or
or
have
anything
to
do
with
them
after
what
you
told
me
i
should
feel
as
if
i
taken
what
belonged
to
some
one
else
as
he
took
the
sheets
from
her
and
pocketed
them
she
felt
that
again
he
was
pocketing
an
insult
as
well
as
a
stab
but
the
victim
was
no
longer
an
inexperienced
youth
so
he
smiled
valorously
as
beseemed
his
manhood
and
yet
he
murmured
you
say
it
is
true
she
did
not
contradict
him
this
time
and
as
he
turned
he
heard
behind
him
the
closing
of
the
door

lxii
after
all
the
wedding
did
not
take
place
on
the
for
on
the
twentieth
keith
was
summoned
to
ilford
by
a
letter
from
his
stepmother
rickman
said
she
thought
he
ought
to
know
as
if
keith
were
seeking
to
avoid
the
knowledge
that
his
father
had
had
a
slight
paralytic
seizure
he
had
recovered
but
it
had
left
him
very
unsettled
and
depressed
he
kept
on
for
ever
worrying
to
see
keith
rickman
hoped
not
without
a
touch
of
asperity
that
keith
would
lose
no
time
in
coming
as
his
father
seemed
so
uneasy
in
his
mind
very
uneasy
in
his
mind
was
isaac
as
upstairs
in
the
big
front
bedroom
which
from
its
excess
of
glass
and
mahogany
bore
a
curious
resemblance
to
the
front
shop
he
lay
a
strangely
shrunken
figure
in
the
great
bed
his
face
once
so
reticent
and
regular
was
drawn
on
one
side
twisted
into
an
oblique
expression
of
abandonment
and
agony
keith
was
not
prepared
for
the
change
and
he
broke
down
completely
as
the
poor
right
hand
which
isaac
use
opened
and
closed
in
a
vain
effort
to
clasp
his
but
isaac
was
intolerant
of
sympathy
and
at
once
rebuked
all
reference
to
his
illness
above
the
wreck
of
his
austere
face
his
eyes
as
they
were
and
hooded
under
their
slack
lids
defied
you
to
notice
any
change
in
him
i
sent
for
you
he
said
because
i
wanted
to
talk
over
a
little
business
his
utterance
was
thick
and
uncertain
the
act
of
speech
showed
the
swollen
tongue
struggling
in
the
distorted
mouth
oh
do
bother
about
business
now
father
said
keith
trying
hard
to
steady
his
voice
his
father
gave
an
irritable
glance
as
if
he
were
repelling
an
accusation
of
mortality
conveyed
in
the
word
now
and
why
not
now
as
well
as
any
other
time
keith
blew
his
nose
hard
and
turned
away
what
the
matter
with
you
do
you
suppose
i
ill
oh
no
of
course
not
no
i
just
lying
here
to
rest
and
get
up
my
strength
again
god
willing
but
anything
should
happen
to
me
keith
i
want
you
to
be
clear
as
to
how
you
stand
oh
that
all
right
said
keith
cheerfully
it
not
all
right
it
not
as
i
meant
it
to
be
between
you
and
me
my
big
house
has
come
to
much
i
think
if
you
stayed
in
it
well
we
wo
say
any
more
about
that
but
paternoster
row
now
that
sound
rickman
always
a
fancy
for
the
city
and
she
put
money
into
it
you
have
your
share
that
was
settled
on
you
when
i
married
your
poor
mother
you
stick
to
the
city
keith
and
it
bring
you
in
something
some
day
and
the
name
still
go
on
it
was
pathetic
his
persistent
clinging
to
the
immortality
of
his
name
pathetic
too
his
inability
to
see
it
otherwise
than
as
blazoned
for
ever
and
ever
over
a
his
son
fame
if
he
ever
achieved
it
was
a
mere
subsidiary
glory
but
pilkington
get
the
strand
whatever
i
do
i
ca
save
it
i
do
mind
owning
now
the
strand
was
a
mistake
a
very
great
mistake
and
pilkington
get
the
library
you
do
know
you
may
get
rid
of
him
before
that
time
isaac
seemed
to
be
torn
by
his
thoughts
the
more
because
they
found
no
expression
in
his
face
that
was
bound
mouth
eye
and
eyelid
in
its
own
agony
before
time
before
the
day
of
his
death
or
the
day
of
redemption
the
mortgage
he
said
still
three
years
to
run
but
i
ca
raise
the
money
keith
was
silent
he
hardly
liked
to
ask
though
he
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
know
the
amount
of
the
sum
his
father
could
not
raise
a
possibility
a
splendid
undreamed
of
possibility
had
risen
up
before
him
but
he
turned
away
from
it
it
was
infamous
to
entertain
it
for
it
depended
on
his
father
death
and
yet
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
help
wondering
whether
the
share
which
would
ultimately
come
to
him
would
by
any
chance
cover
that
mortgage
to
be
any
good
it
would
have
to
come
before
the
three
years
were
up
though
he
put
the
splendid
horrible
thought
aside
he
could
not
contemplate
it
the
wish
was
certainly
not
the
father
of
that
thought
but
supposing
the
thought
became
the
father
of
a
wish
that
reminds
me
said
isaac
that
there
was
something
else
i
to
say
to
you
he
did
not
say
it
all
at
once
at
the
very
thought
of
it
his
swollen
tongue
moved
impotently
without
words
at
last
he
got
it
out
i
been
thinking
it
over
that
affair
of
the
library
and
i
been
led
to
see
that
what
i
did
was
wrong
wrong
i
mean
in
the
sight
of
god
there
was
a
sense
he
could
not
get
rid
of
in
which
it
might
still
be
considered
superlatively
right
and
wot
you
did
oh
never
mind
what
i
did
all
right
you
did
the
righteous
and
the
christian
thing
did
i
i
sure
i
do
know
why
i
did
it
ah
if
you
done
it
for
the
love
of
god
there
no
doubt
it
been
more
pleasing
to
well
you
know
i
did
do
it
for
the
love
of
god
you
did
it
for
the
love
of
woman
i
was
right
then
after
all
isaac
felt
inexpressibly
consoled
by
keith
cheerful
disclaimer
of
all
credit
his
manner
did
away
with
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
but
it
certainly
smoothed
for
him
the
painful
path
of
confession
well
yes
if
it
had
been
for
miss
harden
i
do
suppose
i
should
have
done
it
at
all
he
said
it
very
simply
but
not
all
the
magnificent
consolations
of
religion
could
have
given
isaac
greater
peace
it
was
a
little
more
even
the
balance
of
righteousness
between
him
and
keith
he
had
never
sinned
as
keith
had
done
after
the
flesh
of
the
deeds
done
in
the
body
he
would
have
but
a
very
small
account
to
render
at
the
last
and
you
see
you
have
got
anything
for
it
out
of
there
was
a
certain
satisfaction
in
his
tone
he
saw
a
mark
of
the
divine
displeasure
in
keith
failure
to
marry
the
woman
he
desired
and
if
i
could
only
raise
that
money
he
meant
it
he
meant
it
the
balance
held
in
god
hands
hung
steady
now
how
much
is
it
asked
keith
for
he
thought
perhaps
he
only
holding
on
to
that
share
for
my
sake
and
if
he
knew
that
i
would
give
it
up
now
he
might
really
four
thousand
nine
with
th
interest
said
isaac
do
you
think
keith
it
would
have
sold
for
five
well
yes
i
think
it
very
possibly
might
ah
isaac
turned
his
face
from
his
son
the
sigh
expressed
a
profound
an
infinite
repentance
chapter
lxiii
on
the
isaac
rickman
lay
dead
in
his
villa
at
ilford
two
days
after
keith
visit
he
had
been
seized
by
a
second
and
more
terrible
paralytic
stroke
and
from
it
he
did
not
recover
the
wedding
was
now
indefinitely
postponed
till
such
time
as
keith
could
have
succeeded
in
winding
up
his
father
affairs
they
proved
rather
less
involved
than
he
had
expected
isaac
had
escaped
dying
insolvent
though
a
heavy
mortgage
delivered
in
the
strand
into
pilkington
possession
the
city
house
was
not
only
sound
as
isaac
had
said
but
in
a
fairly
flourishing
condition
some
blind
but
wholly
salutary
instinct
had
made
him
hold
on
to
that
humbler
and
obscurer
shop
where
first
his
fortunes
had
been
made
and
with
its
immense
patronage
among
the
nonconformist
population
rickman
in
the
city
held
a
high
and
honourable
position
in
the
trade
the
bulk
of
the
profits
had
to
go
to
the
bookseller
widow
as
chief
owner
of
the
capital
still
the
slender
partnership
settled
on
his
son
if
preserved
intact
and
carefully
manipulated
would
yield
in
time
a
very
comfortable
addition
to
keith
income
if
isaac
had
lived
his
affairs
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
would
have
been
easily
settled
but
for
his
son
and
heir
they
proved
most
seriously
complicated
for
keith
was
heir
not
only
to
his
father
estate
but
to
that
very
considerable
debt
of
honour
which
isaac
had
left
unpaid
it
seemed
as
if
the
harden
library
the
symbol
of
a
superb
intellectual
vanity
was
doomed
to
be
in
eternal
necessity
of
redemption
until
yesterday
it
had
not
occurred
to
keith
that
it
could
be
his
destiny
to
redeem
it
yesterday
he
had
refused
to
let
his
mind
dally
with
that
possibility
it
had
become
the
most
fitting
subject
of
his
contemplation
the
thing
was
more
easily
conceived
than
done
his
literary
income
amounted
all
told
to
about
three
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
but
its
sources
were
not
absolutely
secure
or
might
conceivably
at
any
moment
cease
to
be
and
there
was
his
marriage
it
was
put
off
but
only
for
a
matter
of
weeks
he
had
only
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
in
ready
money
the
rest
had
been
swallowed
up
by
the
little
house
at
ealing
it
was
impossible
to
redeem
the
harden
library
unless
he
parted
with
his
patrimony
which
was
after
all
his
only
safe
and
imperishable
source
of
income
still
he
had
not
the
smallest
hesitation
on
this
head
neither
he
nor
flossie
had
taken
it
into
their
calculations
when
they
agreed
to
marry
and
he
was
not
going
to
consider
it
now
the
first
step
proved
simple
rickman
had
no
objection
to
buying
him
out
on
the
contrary
she
was
thankful
to
get
rid
of
a
most
reckless
and
uncomfortable
partner
but
in
the
present
state
of
the
trade
it
was
impossible
to
estimate
his
share
at
more
than
four
thousand
that
covered
the
principal
but
isaac
had
paid
no
interest
for
more
than
two
years
and
that
interest
keith
would
have
to
pay
though
the
four
thousand
was
secure
and
pilkington
had
given
him
three
years
to
raise
the
seven
hundred
and
fifty
in
it
was
not
so
easily
done
on
an
income
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
not
easy
in
three
years
and
impossible
in
any
number
of
years
if
he
married
possible
only
yes
just
possible
if
his
marriage
were
postponed
until
such
time
as
he
could
have
collected
the
money
some
brilliant
stroke
of
luck
might
unexpectedly
reduce
the
term
but
three
years
must
be
allowed
and
were
surely
good
for
another
three
years
the
other
alternative
that
of
repudiating
the
obligation
never
entered
his
head
for
an
instant
he
could
not
have
touched
a
shilling
of
his
father
money
till
this
debt
was
cleared
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
what
honour
demanded
of
him
but
how
would
flossie
take
it
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
was
bound
in
honour
again
to
give
her
the
option
of
breaking
off
their
engagement
if
she
did
care
to
wait
and
after
all
that
had
passed
between
them
it
might
not
be
so
easy
to
persuade
her
that
he
was
not
glad
of
the
excuse
for
he
himself
was
so
lacking
in
conviction
still
she
was
very
intelligent
and
she
would
see
that
it
was
his
fault
if
their
marriage
had
to
be
put
off
the
situation
was
inevitable
and
impersonal
and
as
such
it
was
bound
to
be
hard
on
somebody
he
admitted
that
it
was
particularly
hard
on
flossie
it
would
have
been
harder
still
if
flossie
had
been
out
of
work
but
flossie
with
characteristic
prudence
had
held
on
to
her
post
till
the
very
eve
of
her
and
had
contrived
to
return
to
it
when
she
foresaw
the
necessity
for
delay
otherwise
he
would
have
had
to
insist
on
providing
for
her
until
she
was
independent
again
which
would
have
complicated
matters
really
most
horribly
it
was
quite
horrible
enough
to
have
to
explain
all
this
to
flossie
the
last
time
he
had
explained
things
for
he
had
explained
them
to
flossie
the
result
had
not
been
exactly
happy
but
then
the
things
themselves
had
been
very
different
and
he
had
had
to
admit
with
the
utmost
contrition
that
a
woman
could
hardly
have
had
more
reasonable
grounds
for
resentment
that
was
all
over
and
done
with
now
in
that
explanation
they
had
explained
everything
away
they
had
left
no
single
thread
of
illusion
hanging
round
the
life
they
were
to
live
together
they
accepted
themselves
and
each
other
as
they
were
and
in
the
absence
of
any
brighter
prospect
for
either
of
them
there
was
high
wisdom
in
that
acceptance
if
then
there
was
a
lack
of
rapture
in
his
relations
with
flossie
there
would
henceforth
at
any
rate
be
calm
her
temperament
was
he
judged
essentially
placid
not
to
say
apathetic
there
was
a
soft
smoothness
about
the
plump
little
lady
that
would
be
a
security
against
friction
she
was
not
great
at
understanding
but
taking
it
all
together
she
was
now
in
an
infinitely
better
position
for
understanding
him
than
she
had
been
two
weeks
ago
besides
it
was
after
all
a
simple
question
of
figures
and
flossie
attitude
to
figures
was
unlike
his
own
singularly
uninfluenced
by
passion
she
would
take
the
sensible
practical
view
the
sensible
practical
view
was
precisely
what
flossie
did
take
but
her
capabilities
of
passion
he
had
again
misjudged
he
chose
his
moment
with
discretion
when
time
and
place
and
mood
were
most
propitious
the
time
was
sunday
evening
the
place
was
the
regent
park
flossie
mood
was
gentle
and
demure
she
had
been
very
nice
to
him
since
his
father
death
and
had
shown
him
many
careful
small
attentions
which
with
his
abiding
sense
of
his
own
shortcomings
towards
her
he
had
found
extremely
touching
she
seemed
to
him
somehow
a
different
woman
not
perhaps
so
pretty
as
she
had
been
but
nicer
he
may
have
been
the
dupe
of
an
illusory
effect
of
toilette
for
flossie
was
in
black
she
had
discussed
the
propriety
of
mourning
with
miss
bishop
and
wore
it
for
the
first
time
with
a
pretty
air
of
solemnity
mingled
with
satisfaction
in
her
own
delicate
intimation
that
she
was
one
with
her
lover
in
his
grief
she
had
not
yet
discovered
that
black
was
unbecoming
to
her
which
would
have
been
fatal
to
the
mood
the
flowers
were
gay
in
the
broad
walk
flossie
tried
to
be
gay
too
and
called
on
him
to
admire
their
beauty
they
sat
down
together
on
a
seat
in
the
embrasure
of
a
bed
of
chrysanthemums
flossie
was
interested
in
everything
in
the
chrysanthemums
in
the
weather
and
in
the
most
particularly
interested
he
noticed
in
the
family
groups
her
black
eyes
that
glanced
so
restlessly
at
the
men
and
so
jealously
at
the
women
sank
softly
on
the
children
happy
and
appeased
poor
flossie
he
had
long
ago
divined
her
heart
he
did
his
best
to
please
her
he
sat
down
when
she
told
him
to
sit
down
stared
when
she
told
him
to
stare
and
relapsed
into
his
now
habitual
attitude
of
dejection
a
little
girl
toddled
past
him
in
play
stopped
at
his
knees
and
touched
them
with
her
hand
and
rubbed
her
small
body
against
them
chuckling
with
delight
the
dear
little
mite
said
flossie
she
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
you
keith
her
face
was
soft
and
shy
under
her
black
veil
and
when
she
looked
at
him
she
blushed
he
turned
his
head
away
he
could
not
meet
that
look
in
flossie
eyes
when
he
thought
of
what
he
had
to
say
to
her
he
was
going
to
put
the
joy
of
life
a
little
farther
from
her
to
delay
her
woman
tender
ineradicable
hope
this
was
not
the
moment
or
the
place
to
do
it
in
they
rose
and
walked
on
turning
into
the
open
park
and
there
sitting
under
a
solitary
tree
by
the
path
that
goes
towards
john
wood
he
broke
it
to
her
gently
flossie
he
said
i
something
to
tell
you
that
you
may
like
to
hear
she
made
no
sign
of
agitation
beyond
scraping
a
worn
place
in
the
grass
with
the
tips
of
her
little
shoes
well
she
said
with
an
admirable
attempt
at
patience
what
is
it
you
mean
you
think
it
been
about
enough
already
if
it
really
anything
unpleasant
for
goodness
sake
let
have
it
out
and
get
it
over
right
flossie
i
awfully
sorry
but
i
afraid
we
sha
be
able
to
marry
for
another
two
years
perhaps
three
and
why
not
her
black
eyes
darted
a
vindictive
look
at
him
under
her
soft
veil
my
father
death
has
made
a
difference
to
me
her
lips
tightened
and
she
drew
a
sharp
but
inaudible
breath
through
her
nostrils
he
had
been
wrong
in
supposing
that
she
had
not
looked
for
any
improvement
in
his
finances
after
his
father
death
on
the
contrary
knowing
of
their
reconciliation
and
deceived
by
the
imposing
appearance
of
rickman
in
the
strand
she
had
counted
on
a
very
substantial
increase
of
income
do
you
mean
to
say
keith
he
has
left
you
anything
he
laughed
softly
an
unpleasant
way
he
had
in
situations
where
most
people
would
consider
it
only
decent
to
keep
grave
he
left
me
something
a
bad
debt
what
have
you
got
to
do
with
his
bad
debts
nobody
can
come
down
on
you
to
pay
them
she
paused
a
horrible
thought
had
struck
her
they
you
do
mean
to
say
they
can
he
shook
his
head
and
struggled
with
his
monstrous
mirth
keith
what
you
done
you
surely
have
been
backing
any
bills
he
laughed
outright
this
time
for
the
sheer
misery
of
the
thing
no
oh
dear
me
no
not
in
your
sense
at
least
there
any
other
sense
either
you
did
or
you
did
and
i
think
you
might
tell
me
which
it
not
quite
so
simple
dear
i
did
back
his
bills
see
but
i
backed
can
they
make
you
responsible
have
they
got
it
down
in
black
and
white
nobody
can
make
me
responsible
except
myself
it
what
they
call
a
debt
of
honour
flossie
those
debts
are
not
always
down
in
black
and
white
why
ca
you
speak
plain
i
really
ca
think
what
you
mean
by
that
ca
you
i
endeavour
to
explain
a
debt
of
honour
beaver
dear
is
a
debt
that
got
to
be
paid
whoever
else
goes
unpaid
a
fine
lot
of
honour
about
that
said
she
was
it
possible
to
make
the
beaver
understand
he
gave
her
a
slight
outline
of
the
situation
and
he
really
could
not
complain
of
any
fault
in
the
beaver
intelligence
for
by
dint
of
a
masterly
cross
examination
she
possessed
herself
of
all
the
details
even
of
those
which
he
most
desired
to
keep
from
her
after
their
last
great
explanation
there
had
been
more
than
a
tacit
agreement
between
them
that
the
name
of
lucia
harden
was
never
to
come
up
again
in
any
future
discussion
and
that
name
he
would
not
give
she
however
readily
inferred
it
from
his
silence
you
need
tell
me
the
lady
name
said
she
i
certainly
need
the
name
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
oh
has
it
you
not
make
me
believe
that
you
taken
it
up
this
way
for
any
one
but
her
whether
i
would
or
would
does
affect
the
point
of
honour
i
do
see
where
it
comes
in
there
if
you
do
i
ca
make
you
see
it
i
said
i
did
see
where
it
comes
in
i
know
honourable
as
well
as
you
though
i
daresay
my
notions
would
agree
with
yours
upon
my
soul
i
should
wonder
if
they
did
look
here
keith
did
you
ever
make
miss
harden
any
promise
to
pay
her
that
money
when
your
father
died
of
course
i
did
how
could
i
do
you
suppose
she
have
let
me
do
anything
of
the
sort
i
do
know
what
she
would
have
let
you
do
anyhow
you
make
her
any
promise
think
of
the
promises
and
promises
you
made
to
me
i
do
think
of
them
have
i
broken
one
of
them
i
do
say
you
have
yet
but
you
want
to
i
do
wa
i
wo
break
them
i
keep
every
one
of
the
blessed
lot
if
you
only
give
me
time
give
you
time
i
know
what
that
means
it
means
that
i
to
go
back
and
earn
my
living
i
can
slave
till
i
drop
for
all
you
care
while
you
go
and
throw
away
all
that
money
on
another
woman
and
i
to
give
you
time
to
do
it
in
i
wo
ask
you
to
wait
for
me
i
perfectly
willing
to
release
you
from
your
engagement
if
you
like
it
seems
only
fair
to
you
you
care
a
lot
do
you
about
what
fair
to
me
i
believe
take
the
bread
out
of
my
mouth
to
give
it
to
her
i
would
flossie
if
it
was
her
bread
that
money
does
belong
to
you
or
me
it
belongs
to
miss
harden
it
seems
to
me
said
flossie
that
everything
belongs
to
her
sure
you
as
good
as
told
me
so
i
certainly
given
you
some
right
to
think
so
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
we
agreed
that
we
were
going
to
let
it
alone
did
we
it
was
me
that
brought
it
up
again
it
was
you
and
it
got
everything
to
do
with
it
you
would
have
behaved
like
this
and
you
would
be
sitting
there
talking
about
what
honourable
if
it
had
been
for
miss
harden
that
may
very
well
be
but
it
does
mean
what
you
think
it
does
it
means
that
before
i
knew
miss
harden
i
did
know
or
care
very
much
about
what
honourable
she
taught
me
to
care
i
was
fit
to
speak
to
a
decent
woman
before
i
knew
her
she
made
me
decent
did
she
sit
up
half
the
night
with
you
to
do
it
he
made
a
gesture
of
miserable
impatience
you
need
tell
me
i
can
see
her
you
ca
she
did
it
by
simply
being
what
she
is
if
i
ever
manage
to
do
anything
right
it
will
be
because
of
her
as
you
say
but
it
does
follow
that
it
be
for
her
there
a
great
difference
i
do
see
it
you
must
try
to
see
it
there
one
thing
i
have
told
you
about
that
confounded
money
it
was
i
who
let
her
in
for
losing
it
that
enough
to
make
me
keen
you
always
were
keen
where
she
was
concerned
look
here
flossie
i
thought
you
were
going
to
give
up
this
sort
of
thing
so
i
was
when
i
thought
you
were
going
to
give
her
up
it
look
like
it
my
dear
child
how
can
i
give
up
what
i
never
had
or
could
have
well
then
are
you
going
to
give
up
your
idea
no
i
am
not
but
you
can
either
give
me
up
or
wait
for
me
as
i
said
but
if
you
marry
me
you
must
marry
me
and
my
idea
too
you
do
like
my
idea
but
that
no
reason
why
you
should
like
me
you
not
taking
much
pains
to
make
me
like
you
i
taking
all
the
pains
i
know
but
your
liking
or
not
liking
me
wo
alter
me
a
little
bit
you
have
to
take
me
as
i
am
as
she
looked
up
at
him
she
realized
at
last
the
indomitable
nature
of
the
man
she
had
to
deal
with
and
yet
he
was
not
unalterable
even
on
his
own
showing
she
knew
some
one
who
had
altered
him
out
of
all
knowledge
come
said
she
do
say
you
never
change
i
do
say
it
you
have
to
allow
for
that
possibility
too
it
seems
to
me
i
have
to
allow
for
a
good
many
things
you
have
indeed
well
are
we
going
to
sit
here
all
night
i
ready
they
walked
back
in
silence
over
the
straight
path
that
seemed
as
if
it
would
never
end
flossie
stopped
in
it
stung
by
an
idea
there
something
you
have
thought
of
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
the
house
and
with
all
that
furniture
let
them
to
somebody
that
all
right
beaver
the
house
and
the
furniture
ca
run
away
no
but
they
never
be
the
same
again
nothing
would
ever
be
the
same
again
that
was
clear
the
flowers
were
still
gay
in
the
broad
walk
and
the
children
though
a
little
sleepier
were
still
adorable
but
flossie
did
not
turn
to
look
at
them
as
she
passed
would
she
ever
look
at
them
at
anything
with
pleasure
again
he
had
made
life
very
difficult
very
cruel
to
this
poor
child
whom
after
all
he
had
promised
to
protect
and
care
for
i
say
beaver
dear
it
hard
luck
on
you
the
look
and
the
tone
would
have
softened
most
women
at
least
for
the
time
being
but
the
beaver
remained
implacable
i
try
to
make
it
easier
for
you
i
work
like
mad
i
do
anything
to
shorten
the
time
shorten
the
time
you
do
know
how
many
years
you
asking
me
to
wait
i
not
asking
you
to
wait
i
asking
you
to
choose
do
you
want
me
to
do
it
now
no
certainly
not
she
was
not
indeed
in
a
mood
favourable
to
choice
and
he
would
not
influence
her
decision
it
was
mean
to
urge
her
to
an
arduous
constancy
meaner
still
to
precipitate
her
refusal
you
must
think
you
can
you
know
when
you
give
your
mind
to
it
she
appeared
to
be
giving
her
mind
to
it
for
the
rest
of
the
way
home
and
her
silence
left
him
also
free
to
think
it
over
after
all
what
had
he
done
he
had
not
asked
her
to
wait
but
what
if
he
had
many
men
have
to
ask
as
much
of
the
woman
who
loves
them
some
men
have
asked
even
more
of
the
woman
whom
they
love
that
was
the
secret
he
could
have
asked
it
with
a
clear
conscience
if
he
had
but
loved
her
chapter
lxiv
flossie
was
in
no
hurry
about
making
up
her
mind
if
keith
had
asked
her
to
give
him
time
it
was
only
fair
that
he
should
give
her
time
too
and
since
his
mind
was
made
up
in
any
case
time
could
be
no
object
to
him
so
days
and
weeks
had
passed
on
and
she
had
conveyed
to
him
no
hint
of
her
decision
on
that
sunday
evening
in
the
seclusion
of
her
bedroom
flossie
said
to
herself
that
she
had
made
one
great
mistake
prudence
and
foresight
were
all
very
well
in
their
way
but
this
time
she
had
blundered
through
excess
of
caution
in
sticking
to
the
post
that
made
her
independent
she
had
broken
her
strongest
line
of
defence
if
only
she
had
had
the
courage
to
relinquish
it
at
the
crucial
moment
she
would
have
stood
a
very
much
better
chance
in
her
contest
with
keith
she
could
then
have
appealed
to
his
pity
as
she
had
done
with
such
signal
success
two
years
ago
when
the
result
of
the
appeal
had
been
to
bring
him
violently
to
the
point
she
was
wise
enough
to
know
that
in
contending
with
a
chivalrous
man
a
woman
strongest
defence
is
her
defencelessness
though
she
was
unable
to
believe
that
pure
abstract
honour
was
or
could
be
the
sole
and
supreme
motive
of
behaviour
she
felt
that
if
she
could
have
said
to
him
i
thrown
up
a
good
situation
to
marry
you
his
chivalry
would
not
have
held
out
against
that
argument
but
flossie
never
made
mistakes
she
was
too
consummate
a
diplomatist
therefore
though
appearances
were
against
her
it
was
only
reasonable
to
suppose
that
she
had
not
really
done
so
now
and
that
her
original
inspiration
had
been
right
it
was
foresight
so
subtle
so
advanced
that
it
outstripped
the
ordinary
processes
of
calculation
and
appeared
afterwards
as
the
mysterious
leading
of
a
profounder
power
of
the
that
presses
the
innocent
intellect
into
the
services
of
its
own
elemental
instincts
the
people
who
yield
most
obediently
to
this
compulsion
are
said
to
have
good
luck
flossie
good
luck
however
was
not
yet
apparent
either
to
herself
or
to
her
at
tavistock
place
not
that
she
had
enlarged
on
her
trouble
to
any
of
them
the
whole
thing
had
been
too
profoundly
humiliating
for
that
to
say
nothing
of
being
engaged
to
a
man
who
had
shown
so
very
little
impatience
to
marry
her
to
have
taken
and
furnished
a
house
and
be
unable
to
live
in
it
to
have
received
congratulations
and
wedding
presents
which
had
all
proved
premature
to
know
and
feel
that
everybody
else
knew
that
her
bedroom
was
at
this
moment
lumbered
up
with
a
trousseau
which
whether
she
wore
it
or
put
it
by
two
years
would
make
her
equally
ridiculous
was
really
a
very
trying
position
for
any
young
lady
and
to
flossie
whose
nature
was
most
delicately
sensitive
to
such
considerations
it
was
torture
but
after
all
these
things
were
material
and
external
and
the
worst
of
flossie
suffering
was
in
her
soul
before
the
appearance
of
miss
harden
the
last
two
years
had
passed
for
flossie
in
gorgeous
triumphal
procession
through
the
she
had
been
the
invincible
heroine
of
downey
for
two
years
she
had
dragged
its
young
hero
at
her
chariot
wheels
for
two
years
she
had
filled
the
heart
of
ada
bishop
with
envy
and
the
hearts
of
soper
and
spinks
with
jealousy
and
anguish
for
two
years
and
now
she
had
all
these
people
pitying
her
and
looking
down
on
her
because
she
had
been
so
queerly
treated
and
this
was
even
more
intolerable
to
poor
flossie
she
knew
perfectly
well
what
every
one
of
them
was
saying
she
knew
that
ada
bishop
had
thanked
goodness
she
was
in
her
shoes
that
miss
bramble
spoke
of
her
persistently
as
that
poor
young
thing
that
downey
did
know
which
she
pitied
most
her
or
poor
rickman
he
was
poor
rickman
if
you
please
because
he
was
considered
to
have
entangled
himself
so
inextricably
with
her
she
knew
that
miss
roots
maintained
that
it
was
all
her
flossie
own
fault
for
holding
keith
to
his
engagement
that
partridge
had
wondered
why
girls
were
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
married
and
that
soper
said
she
made
a
great
mistake
in
ever
taking
up
with
a
young
fellow
you
could
depend
on
with
so
little
certainty
and
the
burden
of
it
all
was
that
flossie
had
made
a
fool
of
herself
and
been
made
a
fool
of
so
she
was
very
bitter
in
her
little
heart
against
the
man
who
was
the
cause
of
it
all
and
if
she
did
not
instantly
throw
keith
rickman
over
that
was
because
flossie
was
not
really
such
a
fool
as
for
the
moment
she
had
been
made
to
look
but
there
was
one
person
of
the
whose
opinion
was
as
yet
unknown
to
flossie
or
to
anybody
else
it
was
doubtful
indeed
if
it
was
known
altogether
to
himself
for
spinks
conceived
that
honour
bound
him
to
a
superb
reticence
on
the
subject
he
had
followed
with
breathless
anxiety
every
turn
in
the
love
affairs
of
flossie
and
his
friend
he
could
not
deny
that
a
base
and
secret
exultation
had
possessed
him
on
the
amazing
advent
of
miss
harden
for
love
had
made
him
preternaturally
keen
and
he
was
visited
with
mysterious
intimations
of
the
truth
he
did
not
encourage
these
visitings
he
had
tried
hard
to
persuade
himself
that
he
was
glad
for
flossie
sake
when
miss
harden
went
away
when
whatever
there
had
been
between
rickets
and
the
lady
it
had
come
to
nothing
when
the
wedding
day
remained
fixed
immovably
fixed
but
he
had
not
been
glad
at
all
on
the
contrary
he
had
suffered
horribly
and
had
felt
the
subsequent
delay
as
a
cruel
prolongation
of
his
agony
in
the
irony
of
destiny
shortly
before
the
fatal
spinks
had
been
made
partner
in
his
uncle
business
and
was
now
enjoying
an
income
superior
to
rickman
not
only
in
amount
but
in
security
if
anything
could
have
added
to
his
dejection
it
was
that
his
one
consolation
hitherto
had
been
that
after
all
if
rickman
did
marry
flossie
as
was
not
in
a
position
to
marry
her
it
came
to
the
same
thing
in
the
long
run
now
he
saw
himself
cut
off
from
that
source
of
comfort
by
a
solid
four
hundred
a
year
with
prospects
of
a
rise
he
could
forego
the
obviously
impossible
but
in
that
rosy
dawn
of
incarnation
his
dream
appeared
more
than
ever
desirable
whenever
imagination
encountered
the
idea
of
marriage
it
had
tried
to
look
another
way
marriage
remote
and
unattainable
left
imagination
in
comparative
peace
but
brought
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
its
appeal
was
simply
maddening
and
now
bringing
it
nearer
still
so
near
that
it
was
impossible
to
look
another
way
there
came
these
disturbing
suggestions
of
a
misunderstanding
between
rickman
and
his
beaver
the
knew
nothing
but
that
the
wedding
was
put
off
because
rickman
was
in
difficulties
and
could
not
afford
to
marry
at
the
moment
spinks
would
have
accepted
this
explanation
as
sufficient
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
peculiar
behaviour
of
rickman
and
the
very
mysterious
and
agitating
change
in
flossie
manner
old
rickets
had
returned
to
his
awful
solitude
he
absented
himself
entirely
from
the
when
you
met
him
on
the
stairs
he
was
incommunicative
and
gloomy
and
whatever
you
asked
him
to
do
he
was
too
busy
to
do
it
his
sole
attention
to
poor
flossie
was
to
take
her
for
an
occasional
airing
in
the
park
on
sunday
afternoons
spinks
had
come
across
them
there
walking
sadly
side
by
side
flossie
for
propriety
sake
would
be
making
a
little
conversation
as
he
went
by
but
rickman
had
always
the
shut
mouth
and
steady
eyes
of
invincible
determination
what
was
it
that
razors
was
so
determined
about
to
marry
flossie
or
not
to
marry
her
that
was
the
question
which
agitated
poor
spinks
from
morning
till
night
or
rather
from
night
till
morning
the
worst
of
it
was
that
the
very
nature
of
his
woes
compelled
him
as
an
honourable
person
to
keep
them
to
himself
but
there
was
no
secret
which
could
be
long
concealed
from
the
eyes
of
that
clever
lady
miss
roots
and
she
had
contrived
in
the
most
delicate
manner
to
convey
to
the
unfortunate
youth
that
he
had
her
sympathy
spinks
bound
by
his
honour
had
used
no
words
in
divulging
his
agony
but
their
unspoken
confidences
had
gone
so
far
that
miss
roots
at
last
permitted
herself
to
say
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
find
out
whether
it
was
on
or
off
but
said
the
miserable
spinks
would
that
be
fair
to
rickman
i
think
so
said
the
lady
with
a
smile
that
would
have
been
sweet
had
it
been
rather
less
astute
mind
you
i
not
in
their
secrets
but
i
believe
you
really
need
be
afraid
of
that
yes
but
how
in
heaven
name
am
i
to
find
out
i
ca
ask
him
and
i
ca
ask
her
why
ca
you
ask
them
spinks
was
unable
to
say
why
but
his
delicacy
shrank
from
either
course
as
in
some
subtle
way
unfair
besides
he
distrusted
miss
roots
counsel
for
she
had
not
been
nice
to
flossie
oh
lord
said
spinks
what
an
orful
mess
i
in
he
said
it
to
himself
for
he
had
resolved
to
talk
no
longer
to
miss
roots
he
could
have
borne
it
better
had
not
the
terrible
preoccupation
of
rickman
thrown
flossie
on
his
hands
in
common
decency
he
had
to
talk
to
her
at
the
but
it
was
chivalry
surely
that
drew
him
to
her
in
the
afterwards
she
had
to
be
protected
poor
flossie
from
the
shrewdness
of
miss
roots
the
impertinence
of
soper
and
the
painful
sympathy
of
the
other
boarders
with
the
very
best
and
noblest
intentions
in
the
world
spinks
descended
nightly
into
that
atmosphere
of
gloom
and
there
let
loose
his
imperishable
hilarity
he
was
quite
safe
he
knew
as
long
as
their
relations
could
be
kept
upon
a
purely
hilarious
footing
but
flossie
manner
intimated
what
it
had
never
intimated
before
that
she
now
realized
and
preferred
the
serious
side
of
him
and
there
was
no
way
by
which
the
humorous
spinks
was
more
profoundly
flattered
than
in
being
taken
seriously
some
nights
they
had
the
to
themselves
but
for
the
harmless
presence
of
partridge
dozing
in
his
chair
and
then
to
see
flossie
struggling
to
keep
a
polite
little
smile
hovering
on
a
mouth
too
tiny
to
support
it
to
see
her
give
up
the
effort
and
suddenly
become
grave
to
see
her
turn
away
to
hide
her
gravity
with
all
the
precautions
another
woman
takes
to
conceal
her
merriment
to
see
her
sitting
there
absolutely
unmoved
by
the
diverting
behaviour
of
partridge
in
his
slumber
was
profoundly
agitating
to
spinks
i
sure
said
flossie
one
night
it
was
nearly
three
weeks
after
the
scene
with
rickman
in
the
park
i
sure
i
do
know
why
laughing
so
much
there
nothing
to
laugh
at
that
i
can
see
spinks
could
have
have
replied
in
byron
fashion
that
if
he
laughed
that
he
might
not
weep
but
he
restrained
himself
and
all
he
said
was
i
like
to
see
you
larf
well
you
ca
say
you
ever
seen
me
cry
no
i
have
i
should
like
to
see
flossie
and
i
should
like
to
be
the
one
that
made
you
would
you
flossie
put
her
pocket
handkerchief
to
her
little
nose
and
under
the
corner
of
it
there
peeped
the
of
a
lurking
smile
no
said
spinks
simply
i
would
he
was
thinking
of
miss
roots
the
theory
of
rickman
bad
behaviour
had
never
entered
his
head
what
more
i
do
think
any
nice
person
would
do
it
do
you
no
not
any
really
nice
person
it
generally
said
flossie
sweetly
meditative
the
nicest
person
you
know
who
can
make
you
cry
most
not
that
crying
no
but
i
can
see
that
somebody
been
annoying
you
and
i
think
i
can
guess
pretty
well
who
it
is
too
nothing
would
please
me
more
than
to
five
minutes
private
conversation
with
that
person
he
was
thinking
of
miss
harden
now
you
must
dream
of
it
it
would
do
you
know
it
really
would
look
here
promise
me
you
never
say
a
word
well
it
safe
enough
to
promise
there
are
many
opportunities
of
meeting
no
that
the
worst
of
it
there
are
now
still
you
might
meet
him
any
minute
on
the
stairs
or
anywhere
and
if
you
go
saying
things
you
only
make
him
angry
oh
it
a
him
is
it
he
was
thinking
of
soper
know
do
say
soper
been
making
himself
unpleasant
he
always
unpleasant
is
he
by
if
i
catch
him
do
be
quiet
it
is
mr
soper
is
it
no
how
could
it
be
you
do
call
soper
do
you
spinks
was
really
quiet
for
a
moment
i
say
flossie
have
you
and
rickets
been
a
bit
of
a
tiff
what
do
you
want
to
know
that
for
it
nothing
to
you
well
it
is
just
my
curiosity
it
because
i
might
be
able
to
help
you
floss
if
you
did
mind
telling
me
what
it
was
i
not
a
clever
fellow
but
there
no
one
in
this
house
understands
old
razors
as
well
as
i
do
then
you
must
be
pretty
sharp
for
i
ca
understand
him
at
all
has
he
been
saying
anything
to
you
oh
no
he
would
say
anything
you
do
talk
about
these
things
you
know
i
thought
he
might
to
you
me
i
the
very
last
person
he
dream
of
talking
to
i
thought
you
were
such
friends
so
we
are
but
you
see
he
never
talks
about
you
to
me
flossie
why
ever
not
that
why
because
we
friends
because
he
would
think
it
fair
fair
to
who
to
me
of
course
why
should
it
be
fair
to
you
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
floor
as
long
as
she
looked
at
him
spinks
held
himself
well
in
hand
but
the
sudden
withdrawing
of
those
dangerous
weapons
threw
him
off
his
guard
because
he
knows
i
oh
hang
it
all
that
what
i
swore
i
say
you
have
said
it
no
but
i
made
you
see
it
his
handsome
face
stiffened
with
horror
at
his
stupidity
to
let
fall
the
slightest
hint
of
his
feeling
was
he
felt
the
last
disloyalty
to
rickman
he
had
a
vague
idea
that
he
ought
instantly
to
go
but
instead
of
going
he
sat
there
silent
fixing
on
his
own
enormity
a
mental
stare
so
concentrated
that
it
would
have
drawn
attention
to
it
if
she
had
not
seen
it
all
the
time
if
there
anything
to
see
said
she
there
no
reason
why
i
should
see
it
not
there
every
reason
though
why
i
should
have
held
my
silly
tongue
why
what
difference
does
it
make
it
does
make
any
difference
to
you
of
course
and
it
ca
make
any
difference
really
to
him
but
it
a
downright
dishonourable
thing
to
do
and
that
makes
a
jolly
lot
of
difference
to
me
you
see
i
have
any
business
to
go
and
feel
like
this
oh
well
you
ca
help
your
feelings
can
you
she
said
softly
anybody
may
have
feelings
yes
but
a
decent
chap
you
know
would
let
on
that
he
had
any
at
least
not
when
the
girl
he
he
you
know
what
i
mean
it
what
i
must
say
when
she
and
the
other
fellow
were
hitting
it
off
very
well
together
oh
you
think
it
might
make
a
difference
then
no
i
do
not
reelly
it
only
the
feeling
i
have
about
it
you
see
it
seems
somehow
so
mean
razors
would
have
done
it
if
it
had
been
me
you
know
but
it
could
have
been
you
of
course
it
could
said
the
miserable
spinks
with
a
weak
spurt
of
anger
that
was
only
my
way
of
putting
it
what
are
you
driving
at
what
ever
did
you
think
i
said
never
mind
what
you
said
you
making
me
talk
about
it
and
i
said
i
would
when
did
you
say
that
ages
ago
when
rickets
first
told
me
you
and
he
oh
that
that
was
so
long
ago
that
it
does
matter
much
now
oh
does
it
though
it
matters
a
jolly
sight
more
you
said
there
was
bitterness
in
his
tone
you
said
it
could
have
been
me
as
if
i
did
know
that
i
did
mean
it
could
have
been
you
not
in
that
way
i
only
meant
that
you
have
well
you
have
behaved
very
differently
if
it
had
been
you
and
so
i
believe
you
would
you
do
know
how
i
behaved
i
a
pretty
good
idea
though
she
looked
straight
at
him
this
time
and
he
grew
strangely
brave
look
here
flossie
he
said
solemnly
you
know
as
i
just
let
it
out
that
i
most
gone
on
you
i
do
suppose
anything
i
would
do
for
you
except
well
i
really
do
know
what
you
driving
at
but
if
it
anything
to
do
with
razors
i
rather
not
hear
about
it
if
you
do
mind
it
is
fair
really
you
see
it
putting
me
in
such
a
delicate
position
i
do
think
you
very
kind
sidney
you
do
think
of
me
or
what
sort
of
a
position
you
put
me
in
i
sure
i
would
have
said
a
word
only
you
asked
me
to
tell
you
all
about
it
you
need
say
you
did
that
was
when
i
thought
i
could
help
you
to
patch
it
up
but
if
i
ca
it
another
matter
patch
it
up
do
you
think
i
let
you
try
i
do
believe
in
patching
things
up
once
they
broken
off
i
say
flossie
it
has
come
to
that
it
could
come
to
anything
else
the
way
it
was
going
oh
lord
spinks
buried
a
crimson
face
in
his
hands
if
only
he
had
felt
such
a
horrible
exultation
i
thought
you
knew
is
that
what
we
been
talking
about
all
the
time
i
did
understand
i
only
thought
did
tell
me
mind
you
i
thought
it
was
just
put
off
because
he
could
afford
to
marry
quite
so
soon
do
you
think
three
hundred
a
year
is
enough
to
marry
on
well
i
should
care
to
marry
on
that
myself
not
if
it
regular
he
quite
right
flossie
you
see
a
man
has
got
only
his
wife
to
think
of
no
i
suppose
he
must
think
of
himself
a
little
too
oh
well
no
if
he
a
decent
chap
he
thinks
of
his
children
flossie
face
was
crimson
too
while
her
thoughts
flew
to
that
unfurnished
room
in
the
brown
house
at
ealing
she
was
losing
sight
of
keith
rickman
for
behind
keith
rickman
there
was
sidney
spinks
and
behind
sidney
spinks
there
was
the
indomitable
dream
she
did
not
look
at
spinks
therefore
but
gazed
steadily
at
the
top
of
head
with
one
word
spinks
had
destroyed
the
effect
he
had
calculated
on
from
his
honourable
reticence
perhaps
it
was
because
thoughts
had
flown
so
far
that
her
voice
seemed
to
come
from
somewhere
a
long
way
off
too
what
would
you
think
enough
to
marry
on
then
well
i
should
care
to
do
it
much
under
four
hundred
myself
he
said
guardedly
and
i
suppose
if
you
had
it
you
expect
a
girl
to
wait
for
you
any
time
until
you
made
it
well
of
course
i
should
if
we
were
engaged
already
but
i
ask
any
girl
to
marry
me
unless
i
could
afford
to
keep
her
you
would
but
no
and
i
would
let
on
that
i
cared
for
her
either
i
would
let
on
under
four
hundred
certain
oh
said
flossie
very
quietly
and
spinks
was
crushed
under
a
sense
of
fresh
disloyalty
to
rickman
his
defence
of
rickman
had
been
made
to
turn
into
a
pleading
for
himself
but
razors
is
different
be
making
twice
that
in
no
time
you
see
i
should
be
afraid
to
ask
any
one
if
i
was
him
vainly
the
honourable
youth
sought
to
hide
his
splendour
flossie
had
drawn
from
him
all
she
needed
now
to
know
look
here
floss
you
say
it
broken
off
would
you
mind
telling
me
was
it
you
or
was
it
he
who
did
it
his
tone
expressed
acute
anxiety
on
this
point
for
in
poor
spinks
code
of
honour
it
made
all
the
difference
but
he
felt
that
his
question
was
clearly
answered
for
the
silence
of
razors
argued
sufficiently
that
it
was
he
well
said
flossie
with
a
touch
of
maidenly
dignity
whichever
it
was
it
was
likely
to
be
keith
spinks
face
would
have
fallen
but
for
its
immense
surprise
in
this
case
rickman
ought
yes
he
certainly
ought
to
have
told
him
it
was
behaving
quite
straight
he
considered
to
keep
it
from
the
man
who
had
the
best
right
in
the
world
to
know
a
fellow
who
had
always
acted
straight
with
him
but
perhaps
poor
chap
he
was
only
waiting
a
little
on
the
chance
of
the
beaver
changing
her
mind
do
you
think
flossie
that
if
he
tried
hard
he
could
bring
it
on
again
no
he
could
never
not
if
he
tried
from
now
till
next
year
not
if
he
went
on
his
bended
knees
to
me
spinks
reflected
that
rickman
knees
did
take
kindly
to
bending
have
you
been
a
little
just
a
little
hard
on
him
he
such
a
sensitive
little
chap
if
i
was
a
woman
i
do
think
i
could
let
him
go
like
that
you
might
let
him
have
another
try
poor
spinks
was
so
earnest
so
sincere
so
unaffectedly
determined
not
to
take
advantage
of
the
situation
that
it
dawned
on
flossie
that
dignity
must
now
yield
a
little
to
diplomacy
she
was
not
making
the
best
possible
case
for
herself
by
representing
the
rupture
as
to
tell
you
the
truth
sidney
he
does
want
to
try
we
agreed
about
it
we
both
of
us
found
we
made
a
great
mistake
i
wish
could
be
as
sure
of
that
why
what
difference
could
it
make
to
you
said
flossie
turning
on
him
the
large
eyes
of
innocence
eyes
so
dark
so
deep
that
her
thoughts
were
lost
in
them
it
would
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
if
i
knew
you
making
a
lot
bigger
mistake
now
he
rose
i
think
if
you
mind
i
a
few
words
with
rickets
after
all
i
think
i
go
up
and
see
him
now
there
was
no
change
in
the
expression
of
her
eyes
but
her
eyelids
quivered
no
sidney
do
for
goodness
sake
do
go
and
say
anything
i
not
going
to
say
anything
i
only
want
to
know
i
told
you
everything
everything
i
can
yes
but
it
what
you
ca
tell
me
that
i
want
to
know
well
but
do
wait
a
bit
do
you
speak
to
him
before
i
see
him
because
i
do
want
him
to
think
i
given
him
away
i
take
good
care
he
does
think
that
flossie
but
i
going
to
get
this
off
my
mind
well
then
you
must
just
take
him
a
message
from
me
say
thought
it
over
and
that
i
told
you
everything
do
forget
told
you
everything
say
mind
you
tell
him
that
before
you
begin
about
anything
else
then
he
understand
all
right
i
tell
him
her
eyes
followed
him
dubiously
as
he
stumbled
over
legs
in
his
excited
crossing
of
the
room
she
was
by
no
means
sure
of
her
ambassador
discretion
his
heart
would
make
no
blunder
but
could
she
trust
his
head
up
to
this
point
flossie
had
played
her
game
with
admirable
skill
she
had
without
showing
one
card
of
her
own
caused
spinks
to
reveal
his
entire
hand
it
was
not
until
she
had
drawn
from
him
the
assurance
of
his
imperishable
devotion
together
with
the
exact
amount
of
his
equally
imperishable
income
that
she
had
committed
herself
to
a
really
decisive
move
she
was
perfectly
well
aware
of
its
delicacy
and
danger
not
for
worlds
would
she
have
had
spinks
guess
that
rickman
was
still
waiting
for
her
decision
and
yet
if
spinks
referred
rashly
and
without
any
preparation
to
the
breaking
off
of
the
engagement
rickman
natural
reply
would
be
that
this
was
the
first
he
had
heard
of
it
therefore
did
she
so
manoeuvre
and
contrive
as
to
make
rickman
suppose
that
spinks
was
the
accredited
bearer
of
her
ultimatum
while
spinks
himself
remained
unaware
that
he
was
conveying
the
first
intimation
of
it
it
was
an
exceedingly
risky
thing
to
do
but
flossie
playing
for
high
stakes
had
calculated
her
risk
to
a
nicety
she
must
make
up
her
mind
to
lose
something
as
the
game
now
stood
the
moral
approbation
of
spinks
was
more
valuable
to
her
than
the
moral
approbation
of
rickman
and
in
venturing
this
final
move
she
had
reckoned
that
the
moral
approbation
of
rickman
was
all
she
had
to
lose
unless
of
course
he
chose
to
give
her
away
but
rickman
could
be
trusted
not
to
give
her
away
when
spinks
presented
himself
in
rickman
study
he
obtained
admission
in
spite
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
the
youth
solemn
agitation
was
not
to
be
gainsaid
he
first
of
all
delivered
himself
of
message
faithfully
word
for
word
oh
so
she
told
you
everything
has
she
and
what
did
she
tell
you
why
that
it
was
all
over
between
you
broken
off
you
know
and
you
come
to
me
to
know
if
it
true
is
that
it
well
no
why
should
i
of
course
it
true
if
she
says
so
rickman
reflected
for
a
moment
the
situation
he
perceived
was
delicate
in
the
extreme
delicate
beyond
his
power
to
deal
with
it
but
the
god
did
not
forsake
his
own
and
inspiration
came
to
him
you
right
there
spinky
of
course
it
true
if
she
says
so
she
seemed
to
think
you
would
mind
her
telling
me
she
said
understand
oh
yes
i
think
i
understand
did
she
tell
you
she
had
broken
it
off
he
was
really
anxious
to
know
how
she
had
put
it
yes
but
she
was
most
awfully
nice
about
it
i
made
out
i
mean
she
gave
me
the
impression
that
she
did
it
well
partly
because
she
thought
you
wanted
it
off
but
that
just
what
i
want
to
be
sure
about
do
you
want
it
off
or
do
you
is
that
what
she
wants
to
know
no
it
what
i
want
to
know
what
more
rickets
i
think
i
got
a
fair
right
to
know
it
too
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
that
i
do
want
to
marry
miss
walker
or
that
i
do
spinks
face
flushed
with
the
rosy
dawn
of
an
idea
it
was
possible
that
rickets
did
want
to
marry
her
that
he
was
in
need
of
protection
of
deliverance
there
was
a
great
deed
that
he
spinks
could
do
for
rickets
his
eyes
grew
solemn
as
they
beheld
his
destiny
look
here
said
he
i
want
you
to
tell
me
nothing
but
the
bally
truth
it
the
least
you
can
do
under
the
circumstances
i
do
want
it
for
her
well
yes
i
do
but
i
want
it
for
myself
too
all
right
spinky
you
shall
have
the
best
truth
i
can
give
you
at
such
uncommonly
short
notice
i
ca
say
i
do
want
to
marry
miss
walker
because
that
would
be
very
polite
to
the
lady
but
i
can
say
i
think
she
shown
most
admirable
judgement
and
that
perfectly
satisfied
with
her
decision
i
would
have
her
go
back
on
it
for
worlds
will
that
satisfy
you
it
would
if
i
thought
you
really
meant
it
i
do
mean
it
god
forgive
me
but
that
is
her
fault
poor
little
girl
the
whole
thing
was
the
most
infernal
muddle
and
mistake
ah
that
was
what
she
called
it
a
mistake
spinks
seemed
to
be
clinging
to
and
cherishing
this
word
of
charm
i
glad
for
her
sake
that
she
found
it
out
in
time
i
not
the
sort
of
man
a
girl
like
flossie
ought
to
marry
i
ought
never
to
have
asked
her
upon
my
soul
rickets
i
believe
you
right
there
that
not
saying
anything
against
you
or
against
her
either
no
certainly
not
against
she
all
right
spinky
i
know
i
know
still
spinks
hesitated
restraining
his
ardent
embrace
of
the
truth
presented
to
him
held
back
by
some
scruple
of
shy
unbelieving
modesty
then
you
think
you
really
think
that
there
is
any
reason
why
i
should
cut
in
no
heaven
bless
you
no
reason
in
the
world
as
far
as
concerned
for
god
sake
cut
in
and
win
the
sooner
the
better
now
this
minute
if
you
feel
like
it
but
still
he
lingered
for
the
worst
was
yet
to
come
he
lingered
nursing
a
colossal
scruple
poor
spinks
honour
was
dear
to
him
because
it
was
less
the
gift
of
nature
than
the
supreme
imitative
effort
of
his
adoring
heart
he
loved
honour
because
rickman
loved
it
just
as
he
had
loved
flossie
for
the
same
reason
these
were
the
only
ways
in
which
he
could
imitate
him
and
like
all
imitators
he
exaggerated
the
master
manner
i
say
i
do
know
what
you
think
of
me
i
said
i
never
let
on
to
flossie
that
i
cared
and
i
did
mean
to
i
did
on
my
word
i
do
know
how
it
happened
but
we
got
talking
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
thought
i
was
doing
my
best
to
get
her
to
make
it
up
with
you
thanks
that
was
kind
said
rickman
in
a
queer
voice
which
put
spinks
off
a
bit
i
was
really
razors
i
do
believe
i
have
died
rather
than
let
her
know
how
i
felt
about
her
but
before
i
could
say
knife
she
got
it
out
of
you
no
she
did
do
anything
of
the
sort
it
was
all
me
like
a
damn
fool
i
let
it
out
nothing
could
have
been
more
demoralizing
than
the
spectacle
of
spinks
face
as
he
delivered
himself
of
his
immense
confession
so
fantastically
did
it
endeavour
to
chasten
rapture
with
remorse
rickman
controlled
himself
the
better
to
enjoy
it
for
spinks
taken
seriously
yielded
an
inexhaustible
vein
of
purest
comedy
oh
spinky
he
said
with
grave
reproach
how
could
you
well
i
know
it
was
a
beastly
dishonourable
thing
to
do
but
you
see
i
was
really
most
awkwardly
situated
i
daresay
you
were
it
was
all
very
well
to
laugh
but
in
spite
of
his
amusement
he
sympathized
with
spinky
delicacy
he
also
had
found
himself
in
awkward
situations
more
than
once
still
continued
spinks
with
extreme
dejection
i
ca
think
how
i
came
to
let
it
out
that
and
the
dejection
was
too
much
for
rickman
gravity
if
you
want
the
truth
spinky
the
pity
was
you
ever
kept
it
in
and
his
laughter
held
in
piled
up
monstrous
insane
ungovernable
broke
forth
dispersing
the
last
scruple
that
clouded
the
beatitude
of
spinks
chapter
lxv
often
after
half
a
night
spent
in
a
vain
striving
to
shape
some
immense
idea
into
the
form
of
beauty
be
had
turned
the
thing
neck
and
crop
out
of
his
mind
and
gone
to
sleep
on
it
whenever
he
did
this
he
was
sure
to
wake
up
and
find
it
there
waiting
for
him
and
perfect
as
he
had
dreamed
it
and
desired
it
had
happened
so
often
that
he
had
grown
to
trust
this
profounder
inspiration
of
his
sleep
hitherto
it
was
only
the
problems
of
his
heart
that
had
been
thus
divinely
dealt
with
he
had
been
left
to
struggle
hopelessly
with
the
problems
of
his
life
and
of
these
flossie
was
the
most
insoluble
and
now
that
he
had
given
up
thinking
of
her
had
abandoned
her
to
her
own
mysterious
workings
it
too
had
been
solved
and
in
the
same
simple
inevitable
way
his
contempt
for
flossie
methods
could
not
blind
him
to
the
beneficence
of
the
result
he
wrote
to
her
that
night
to
the
effect
that
he
gladly
and
entirely
acquiesced
in
her
decision
but
that
he
should
have
thought
that
he
and
not
spinks
had
been
entitled
to
the
first
intimation
of
it
he
had
no
doubt
however
that
she
had
done
the
best
and
wisest
thing
he
forbore
to
add
for
both
of
us
his
chivalry
still
persisted
in
regarding
flossie
as
a
deeply
injured
person
he
had
wronged
her
from
the
beginning
had
he
not
laid
on
her
first
the
burden
of
his
passion
and
yet
again
the
double
burden
of
his
genius
and
his
honour
a
heavier
load
that
and
wholly
unfitted
for
the
poor
little
back
that
would
have
had
to
bear
it
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
been
in
any
way
the
victim
of
flossie
powerful
instincts
it
was
maddox
who
said
that
spinks
had
made
himself
immortal
by
his
marriage
that
he
should
be
put
on
the
civil
list
for
his
services
to
literature
of
rickman
place
in
literature
there
could
be
no
question
for
the
next
two
or
three
years
he
foresaw
that
the
thing
was
his
place
on
his
place
on
his
place
if
he
could
find
one
on
any
other
paper
he
had
looked
to
journalism
for
the
means
to
support
a
wife
and
journalism
alone
could
maintain
him
in
his
struggle
with
pilkington
whether
maddox
was
right
or
wrong
in
his
opinion
of
the
disastrous
influence
of
flossie
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
for
the
present
rickman
genius
had
no
more
formidable
rival
than
his
honour
if
it
is
perdition
to
a
great
tragic
dramatist
when
passion
impels
him
to
marry
on
three
hundred
a
year
it
can
hardly
be
desirable
that
conscience
should
constrain
him
to
raise
seven
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
in
three
years
fate
seemed
bent
in
forcing
him
to
live
his
tragedies
rather
than
write
them
but
rickman
free
of
flossie
faced
the
desperate
prospect
with
the
old
reckless
spirit
of
his
youth
for
the
first
year
the
prospect
did
not
look
so
very
desperate
he
had
found
cheap
rooms
unfurnished
in
torrington
square
where
the
houses
are
smaller
and
less
sumptuous
than
downey
he
had
succeeded
in
letting
the
little
house
in
ealing
where
the
abominable
furniture
that
had
nearly
cost
so
dear
justified
its
existence
by
adding
a
small
sum
to
his
income
he
had
benefited
indirectly
by
rankin
greatness
for
rankin
seldom
contributed
anything
to
now
beyond
his
lively
column
once
a
week
and
rickman
was
frequently
called
on
to
fill
his
place
was
good
for
at
least
a
solid
hundred
a
year
once
it
began
to
pay
for
a
solid
two
hundred
and
fifty
or
more
other
papers
for
small
and
varying
sums
when
he
totted
it
all
up
together
he
found
that
he
was
affluent
he
could
reckon
on
a
round
four
hundred
all
told
in
torrington
square
by
the
practice
of
a
little
ingenious
economy
he
could
easily
live
on
a
hundred
and
so
that
by
the
end
of
the
first
year
he
should
have
saved
the
considerable
sum
of
two
hundred
and
pounds
at
that
rate
in
three
years
no
in
two
years
and
a
well
in
rather
more
than
two
and
a
half
years
the
thing
would
be
done
by
a
little
extra
exertion
he
might
be
able
to
reduce
it
to
two
years
to
one
perhaps
by
a
magnificent
stroke
of
luck
such
luck
for
instance
as
a
stage
success
a
run
of
a
hundred
nights
for
the
tragedy
whose
first
act
he
was
writing
now
that
of
course
it
would
be
madness
to
count
on
but
he
had
some
hopes
from
the
sudden
and
extraordinary
transformation
of
sudden
enough
to
the
uninitiated
seeing
that
in
september
the
organ
of
philosophic
criticism
to
all
appearances
died
and
that
in
october
it
burst
into
life
again
under
a
new
cover
and
a
new
title
jewdwine
himself
sounding
the
trump
of
resurrection
old
contributors
knew
it
no
more
or
failed
to
recognise
it
in
on
the
tinted
cover
there
was
no
trace
of
the
familiar
symbolic
so
suggestive
of
an
ionic
frieze
but
the
new
title
in
the
broadest
boldest
blackest
of
type
proclaimed
its
almost
wanton
repudiation
of
the
old
tradition
jewdwine
first
concession
to
modernity
was
a
long
leading
review
of
the
art
of
herbert
rankin
herbert
rankin
was
so
much
amused
with
it
that
it
kept
him
quiet
for
at
least
three
weeks
in
his
playground
of
after
such
a
handsome
appreciation
as
that
he
had
to
wait
a
decent
interval
before
going
for
jewdwine
when
he
remarked
to
rickman
that
it
would
have
been
more
to
the
purpose
if
jewdwine
had
devoted
his
six
columns
to
the
art
of
rickman
blushed
and
turned
his
head
away
as
if
rankin
had
been
guilty
of
some
gross
indelicacy
he
was
still
virginally
sensitive
where
jewdwine
was
concerned
but
in
a
sense
not
intended
by
rankin
jewdwine
was
very
much
occupied
not
to
say
perturbed
by
the
art
of
not
exactly
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
interest
for
rickman
looking
in
on
the
great
editor
one
afternoon
found
him
almost
enthusiastic
over
his
last
discovery
a
new
poet
according
to
jewdwine
had
arisen
in
the
person
of
an
eminent
cabinet
minister
who
in
was
beguiling
the
tedium
of
office
with
a
very
pretty
playing
on
the
pastoral
pipe
fulcher
lay
on
the
editorial
table
bound
in
white
vellum
with
the
figure
of
the
great
god
pan
symbolizing
fulcher
on
the
cover
jewdwine
attitude
to
fulcher
was
for
jewdwine
humble
not
to
say
reverent
he
intimated
to
rickman
that
in
fulcher
he
had
found
what
he
had
wanted
jewdwine
in
the
early
days
of
wore
the
hungry
look
of
a
man
who
having
swallowed
all
his
formulas
finds
himself
unnourished
the
soul
jewdwine
used
to
say
perverting
emerson
is
appeased
by
a
formula
and
it
was
clear
that
his
soul
would
never
be
appeased
until
it
had
found
a
new
one
those
who
now
conversed
intimately
with
jewdwine
were
entertained
no
longer
with
the
absolute
but
they
heard
a
great
deal
about
the
return
to
nature
fulcher
pipings
therefore
were
entirely
in
harmony
with
jewdwine
change
of
mood
but
rickman
who
had
once
protested
so
vigorously
against
the
absolute
would
not
hear
of
the
return
to
nature
either
that
cry
was
only
a
symptom
of
the
inevitable
sickness
of
the
academic
spirit
surfeited
with
its
own
philosophy
he
shook
his
head
mournfully
over
fulcher
what
looked
to
jewdwine
like
simplicity
seemed
to
him
only
a
more
intolerably
sophisticated
pose
than
any
other
i
prefer
fulcher
in
downing
street
to
fulcher
in
arcadia
fulcher
he
said
can
no
more
return
to
nature
than
he
can
enter
a
second
time
into
his
mother
womb
and
be
born
he
walked
up
and
down
the
little
office
excitedly
while
he
drew
for
jewdwine
benefit
an
unattractive
picture
of
the
poet
as
babe
drinking
from
the
breasts
of
the
bounteous
mother
you
ca
go
for
ever
hanging
on
your
mother
breasts
it
is
decent
and
it
manly
return
to
nature
it
only
too
easy
to
return
and
stay
you
do
no
good
at
all
if
you
never
been
there
but
if
you
mean
to
grow
up
you
must
break
loose
and
get
away
the
great
mother
is
inclined
to
bug
some
of
her
children
rather
too
tight
i
fancy
and
by
heaven
it
pretty
tough
work
for
some
of
them
wriggling
out
of
her
arms
he
came
to
a
sudden
standstill
and
turned
on
jewdwine
the
sudden
leaping
light
of
the
blue
eyes
that
seemed
to
see
through
jewdwine
and
beyond
him
no
formula
could
ever
frame
and
hold
for
him
that
vision
of
his
calling
which
had
come
to
him
four
years
ago
on
harcombe
hill
he
had
conceived
and
sung
of
nature
not
as
the
indomitable
parent
by
turns
tyrannous
and
kind
but
as
the
virgin
mystery
the
shy
and
tender
bride
that
waits
in
golden
abysmal
secrecy
for
the
embrace
of
spirit
herself
athirst
for
the
passionate
immortal
hour
he
foresaw
the
supreme
and
indestructible
union
he
saw
one
eternal
nature
and
a
thousand
forms
of
art
differing
according
to
the
virile
soul
and
what
he
saw
he
endeavoured
to
describe
to
jewdwine
that
means
mind
you
that
your
poet
is
a
man
and
not
a
slobbering
infant
exactly
and
nature
will
be
the
mother
of
his
art
as
said
as
you
did
say
the
mother
there
is
any
immaculate
conception
of
truth
do
you
believe
it
for
a
moment
jewdwine
retired
into
himself
a
moment
to
meditate
on
that
telling
word
he
wondered
what
lay
beyond
it
and
art
continued
rickman
is
truth
just
because
it
nature
if
you
mean
said
jewdwine
seeking
a
formula
that
modern
art
is
essentially
subjective
i
agree
with
you
i
mean
that
really
virile
and
original
art
the
art
i
believe
of
the
future
must
spring
from
the
supreme
surrender
of
nature
to
the
human
soul
and
do
you
honestly
believe
that
the
art
of
the
future
will
be
one
bit
more
than
the
art
of
the
present
day
on
the
whole
i
do
well
i
do
i
see
nothing
that
makes
for
it
no
art
can
hold
out
for
ever
against
commercialism
the
nineteenth
century
has
been
commercial
enough
in
all
conscience
bestially
brutally
commercial
but
its
commercialism
and
brutality
will
be
nothing
to
the
commercialism
and
brutality
of
the
twentieth
if
these
things
are
deadly
to
art
now
they
be
ten
times
more
deadly
then
the
mortality
among
poets
my
dear
rickman
will
be
something
terrific
not
a
bit
of
it
the
next
century
if
i
not
mistaken
will
see
a
pretty
big
flare
up
of
a
revolution
and
the
soul
will
come
out
on
top
robespierre
and
martin
luther
wo
be
in
it
jewdwine
with
the
poets
of
that
school
i
glad
you
feel
able
to
take
that
view
of
it
i
do
seem
to
see
the
poets
of
the
twentieth
century
myself
i
see
them
all
right
said
rickman
simply
they
wo
be
the
poets
of
nature
like
the
nineteenth
century
chaps
they
be
the
poets
of
human
nature
dramatic
poets
to
a
man
of
course
it
take
a
revolution
to
produce
that
sort
a
revolution
a
cataclysm
you
mean
no
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
it
only
the
natural
way
a
healthy
poet
grows
look
at
shakespeare
i
believe
you
know
that
most
poets
would
grow
into
dramatic
poets
if
they
lived
long
enough
only
sometimes
they
do
live
and
sometimes
they
do
grow
lyric
poets
are
cases
of
arrested
development
that
all
jewdwine
listened
with
considerable
amusement
as
his
subordinate
propounded
to
him
this
novel
view
he
wondered
what
literary
enormity
rickman
might
be
contemplating
now
that
he
had
something
at
the
back
of
his
mind
was
pretty
evident
jewdwine
meant
to
lie
low
till
from
that
obscure
region
rickman
as
was
his
wont
should
have
brought
out
his
monster
for
inspection
he
produced
it
the
next
instant
blushingly
tenderly
yet
with
no
diminution
of
his
sublime
belief
you
see
you
think
it
sheer
lunacy
but
i
a
sort
of
idea
that
if
i
to
go
on
at
all
myself
it
must
be
on
those
lines
modern
poetic
drama
it
that
or
nothing
you
know
jewdwine
face
said
very
plainly
that
he
had
no
doubt
whatever
of
the
alternative
it
also
expressed
a
curious
and
indefinable
relief
modern
poetic
drama
so
that
your
modest
ambition
is
it
rickman
owned
that
indeed
it
was
my
dear
fellow
modern
poetic
drama
is
a
contradiction
in
all
its
terms
there
are
only
three
schools
of
poetry
possible
the
classic
the
romantic
and
the
natural
art
only
exists
by
one
of
three
principles
normal
beauty
spiritual
spontaneity
and
vital
mystery
or
charm
and
none
of
these
three
is
to
be
found
in
modern
life
these
were
the
laws
he
had
laid
down
in
the
to
which
rickman
in
the
insolence
of
his
genius
had
defied
somehow
the
life
seemed
to
have
departed
from
those
stately
propositions
but
jewdwine
clung
to
them
in
a
desperate
effort
to
preserve
his
critical
integrity
he
was
soothed
by
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
repeating
them
he
caught
as
it
were
an
echo
of
the
majestic
harmonies
that
once
floated
through
his
at
lazarus
besides
he
went
on
where
will
you
find
your
drama
to
begin
with
in
modern
men
and
women
but
modern
men
and
women
are
essentially
undramatic
unpoetic
still
i
must
take
them
because
you
see
there
nothing
else
to
take
there
never
was
or
will
be
the
men
and
women
of
time
were
modern
to
him
you
know
if
they
seem
poetic
to
us
because
a
poet
made
them
so
and
he
made
them
so
because
he
saw
that
essentially
they
so
jewdwine
pushed
out
his
lips
in
the
manner
of
one
unwillingly
dubious
my
dear
rickman
you
have
got
to
learn
your
limitations
or
if
not
your
limitations
the
limitations
made
for
you
by
the
ridiculous
and
unlovely
conditions
of
modern
life
i
have
learnt
them
after
all
what
am
i
to
do
i
modern
modern
as
my
hat
said
rickman
turning
it
in
his
hands
i
admit
that
my
hat
is
even
a
fugitive
form
of
the
eternal
and
absolute
beauty
it
is
i
afraid
horribly
like
everybody
else
hat
in
moments
of
profound
insight
i
feel
that
am
horribly
like
everybody
else
if
it
was
for
that
i
should
have
no
hope
of
achieving
my
modest
ambition
i
not
saying
anything
against
your
modesty
or
your
ambition
not
defying
you
to
write
a
modern
blank
verse
play
but
i
defy
anybody
to
act
one
i
know
said
rickman
it
sad
of
course
but
to
the
frivolous
mind
of
a
critic
there
always
will
be
something
ridiculous
in
the
notion
of
blank
verse
spouted
on
the
stage
by
a
person
in
a
and
a
but
do
you
think
you
see
that
and
if
once
the
great
tragic
passions
got
inside
them
where
the
great
tragic
passions
they
exist
and
are
poetic
as
survivals
only
they
are
poetic
but
not
modern
we
have
the
passions
of
the
and
the
stock
exchange
they
are
modern
if
you
like
but
not
strikingly
poetic
well
even
a
if
you
insist
on
stockbrokers
i
do
take
the
people
take
the
women
i
know
the
women
you
know
is
there
honestly
is
there
any
poetry
in
them
there
is
heaps
oceans
of
poetry
there
always
has
been
and
will
be
it
the
poets
the
great
poets
that
do
turn
up
to
time
well
i
do
care
how
great
a
poet
you
may
be
modern
poetic
drama
is
the
path
of
perdition
for
you
i
wish
he
added
with
an
unmistakable
air
of
turning
to
a
subject
of
real
interest
i
wish
i
knew
what
to
do
with
fulcher
i
do
know
i
only
know
fulcher
art
has
much
to
do
with
nature
i
afraid
it
the
illegitimate
offspring
of
fulcher
and
some
young
shepherdess
of
covent
garden
he
seems
to
have
proved
himself
pretty
much
at
home
in
arcadia
do
you
believe
him
he
only
at
home
in
downing
street
better
leave
him
there
but
jewdwine
did
not
leave
him
there
he
exalted
fulcher
to
the
seventh
heaven
in
four
and
a
half
columns
of
with
his
journalistic
scent
for
the
alluring
and
the
vivid
phrase
he
took
everything
notable
that
rickman
had
said
and
adapted
it
to
fulcher
supplying
a
really
golden
opportunity
for
a
critical
essay
on
truth
to
nature
wherein
fulcher
learnt
to
his
immense
bewilderment
that
there
is
no
immaculate
conception
of
that
truth
but
that
to
fulcher
as
poet
belonged
the
exultation
of
paternity
jewdwine
quoted
coleridge
to
the
effect
that
fulcher
only
received
what
he
was
pleased
to
give
and
that
in
life
alone
did
nature
live
and
when
rankin
falling
on
that
article
asked
maddox
what
it
meant
maddox
replied
that
it
meant
nothing
except
that
fulcher
was
a
cabinet
minister
but
within
three
months
of
the
day
on
which
jewdwine
had
pronounced
the
modern
poetic
drama
to
be
dead
rickman
had
written
the
first
act
of
his
tragedy
which
proved
it
as
far
as
a
first
act
can
prove
anything
to
be
very
much
alive
jewdwine
received
the
announcement
of
this
achievement
with
every
appearance
of
pleasure
he
was
indeed
genuinely
relieved
to
think
that
rickman
was
thus
harmlessly
employed
the
incessant
successful
production
of
would
have
been
prejudicial
to
the
interests
of
a
series
of
triumphant
in
would
have
turned
rickman
aside
for
ever
from
the
columns
of
but
jewdwine
told
himself
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
rivalries
of
the
modern
tragic
muse
rickman
the
journalist
would
live
for
rickman
the
poet
had
set
out
on
the
path
of
perdition
nobody
could
say
that
it
was
jewdwine
who
had
encouraged
him
to
take
it
chapter
lxvi
in
january
began
to
pay
and
hopes
were
justified
he
was
now
a
solid
man
a
man
of
income
for
eighteen
months
he
kept
strictly
within
the
limits
he
had
allowed
himself
his
nature
inclined
him
to
a
riotous
and
absurd
expenditure
and
for
eighteen
months
he
wrestled
with
and
did
violence
to
his
nature
each
sum
he
saved
stood
for
some
triumph
of
ingenious
abnegation
some
miracle
of
and
for
eighteen
months
dicky
pilkington
beholding
the
spectacle
of
his
heroism
laid
ten
to
one
against
his
ultimate
success
the
thing
dicky
said
was
impossible
he
could
never
keep
it
up
but
rickman
once
abandoned
to
a
persistent
and
passionate
economy
there
was
no
more
holding
him
in
on
that
path
than
on
any
other
by
the
middle
of
the
following
year
out
of
an
income
of
four
hundred
he
had
saved
that
sum
he
said
to
himself
that
the
worst
was
over
now
he
had
paid
off
more
than
half
of
his
debt
and
the
remainder
had
still
another
fourteen
months
to
run
only
fourteen
months
passionate
economy
and
the
harden
library
would
be
redeemed
as
he
saw
himself
within
measurable
distance
of
his
end
he
was
seized
by
an
anxiety
an
excitement
that
he
had
not
been
aware
of
at
the
start
the
sight
of
the
goal
perturbed
him
it
suggested
the
failure
that
up
to
that
moment
he
had
not
allowed
himself
to
contemplate
like
an
athlete
he
gathered
himself
together
for
the
final
spurt
and
was
a
brilliant
year
for
made
glorious
by
the
poems
articles
and
paragraphs
showered
on
it
by
maddox
shook
his
head
over
some
of
them
but
he
took
them
all
and
boasted
as
he
well
might
that
published
more
rickman
the
real
rickman
in
six
months
than
would
do
in
as
many
years
he
distinguished
between
rickman
genius
and
his
talent
provided
he
got
his
best
work
anybody
else
was
welcome
to
his
by
anybody
else
he
meant
jewdwine
yet
it
was
a
nobler
feeling
than
professional
rivalry
that
made
him
abhor
the
poet
connection
with
for
maddox
was
if
anything
more
jealous
for
rickman
reputation
than
for
his
own
from
the
very
beginning
he
had
never
ceased
to
wonder
at
his
unaccountable
affection
for
horace
jewdwine
the
infatuation
for
it
amounted
to
infatuation
would
have
been
comprehensible
enough
in
any
other
man
but
it
was
unaccountable
in
rickman
who
was
wholly
destitute
of
reverence
for
the
sources
of
his
income
jewdwine
of
had
been
in
maddox
opinion
a
harmless
philosophic
crank
he
had
done
nothing
absolutely
nothing
for
rickman
genius
but
jewdwine
of
was
dangerous
for
he
encouraged
rickman
talent
and
rickman
talent
would
he
was
afraid
be
ultimately
destructive
to
the
higher
power
so
maddox
prayed
to
heaven
for
promotion
that
he
might
make
rickman
independent
of
jewdwine
and
his
journal
there
were
many
things
that
he
had
in
his
mind
to
do
for
him
in
the
day
of
advancement
his
eyes
raked
the
horizon
sighting
promotion
from
afar
and
in
the
last
two
years
promotion
had
come
very
near
to
maddox
there
were
quarters
influential
quarters
where
he
was
spoken
of
as
a
singularly
original
young
man
and
he
had
the
knack
of
getting
hold
of
singularly
original
young
men
young
men
of
originality
too
singular
perhaps
to
make
the
paper
pay
still
though
the
orbit
of
was
hardly
so
vast
as
maddox
had
anticipated
as
to
its
brilliance
there
could
be
no
two
opinions
in
the
year
the
year
that
saw
rickman
first
struggling
in
the
financier
toils
maddox
had
delivered
his
paper
from
the
power
of
pilkington
promotion
played
with
maddox
it
hovered
round
him
touching
him
tentatively
with
the
tips
of
its
wings
he
lured
it
by
every
innocent
art
within
his
power
but
hitherto
it
had
always
settled
on
some
less
wild
and
wanton
head
at
last
it
came
it
kept
on
coming
from
a
quarter
where
as
he
had
every
right
to
look
for
it
he
had
of
course
never
dreamed
of
looking
rankin
publishers
grown
rich
on
the
proceeds
of
rankin
pen
were
dissatisfied
with
their
reader
the
poor
man
had
not
discovered
rankin
on
rankin
advice
they
offered
his
post
to
maddox
who
had
and
that
at
double
his
salary
they
grew
richer
and
at
a
further
hint
from
rankin
they
made
maddox
a
director
in
the
same
mad
year
they
started
a
new
monthly
and
rankin
again
appointed
maddox
as
their
editor
his
opportunity
had
come
on
the
very
night
of
this
third
appointment
maddox
called
on
rickman
and
proposed
on
behalf
of
rankin
and
stables
to
hand
over
to
him
the
editorship
of
for
stables
he
said
was
too
dog
lazy
and
rankin
too
grossly
prosperous
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
he
did
think
any
of
them
would
ever
make
a
fortune
out
of
it
but
its
editor
income
would
be
at
any
rate
secure
he
omitted
to
mention
that
it
would
be
practically
secured
out
of
his
maddox
own
pocket
you
may
reckon
said
he
on
three
hundred
and
fifty
he
named
the
sum
modestly
humbly
almost
not
that
he
thought
rickman
would
be
sorry
to
have
that
little
addition
to
his
income
but
because
he
was
always
diffident
in
offering
anything
to
rickman
when
you
thought
of
what
he
was
and
he
found
something
startling
not
to
say
upsetting
in
the
joy
that
leapt
up
in
his
young
eyes
you
never
could
tell
how
would
take
a
thing
but
if
he
had
known
he
was
going
to
take
it
that
way
he
would
have
written
him
a
note
he
wondered
whether
was
in
a
tight
corner
head
over
ears
in
debt
or
love
did
the
young
lunatic
want
to
marry
after
that
near
shave
he
had
two
years
ago
you
would
exactly
refuse
three
hundred
and
fifty
but
a
beggar
must
be
brought
pretty
low
to
be
crumpled
up
in
that
way
by
the
mere
mention
of
the
sum
maddox
was
not
aware
that
no
other
combination
of
figures
could
have
excited
precisely
those
emotions
three
hundred
and
fifty
being
the
exact
sum
that
rickman
needed
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
purpose
it
brought
his
dream
nearer
to
him
by
a
year
a
year
why
it
did
more
he
had
only
to
ask
and
maddox
would
advance
the
money
his
dream
was
now
this
moment
within
his
grasp
and
all
he
could
say
was
i
say
you
know
this
is
awfully
good
of
you
good
of
you
rickets
to
take
the
thing
off
my
hands
i
ca
very
well
run
a
monthly
and
a
weekly
with
all
my
other
jobs
thrown
in
the
question
is
whether
i
can
manage
two
weeklies
and
the
other
things
no
you
ca
you
not
built
that
way
but
if
you
take
you
can
afford
to
chuck
tell
you
the
truth
that
one
reason
why
i
want
you
to
take
it
some
of
the
joy
died
out
of
rickman
face
the
other
reason
is
of
course
that
i
ca
think
of
a
better
man
it
awfully
good
of
you
to
think
of
me
at
all
but
why
do
you
want
me
to
chuck
never
mind
why
i
do
say
is
the
best
imaginable
place
for
you
nor
are
you
the
best
imaginable
man
for
but
i
really
ca
think
of
a
better
no
but
why
confound
him
why
ca
he
leave
it
alone
i
shall
lose
my
temper
in
another
minute
said
maddox
to
himself
the
question
is
would
you
like
it
because
if
you
would
do
imagine
you
got
to
take
it
to
oblige
me
of
course
i
like
it
there
is
anything
i
like
so
well
it
settled
then
it
might
have
been
but
rickman
turned
on
him
again
with
his
ungovernable
why
if
you
like
it
ricky
there
nothing
more
to
be
said
i
know
it
is
exactly
a
sumptuous
berth
for
you
but
it
a
bit
better
salary
i
not
thinking
of
the
salary
oh
yes
i
am
though
god
forgive
me
i
thinking
of
nothing
else
salary
apart
said
maddox
with
the
least
touch
of
resentment
a
better
thing
for
you
to
edit
than
to
of
course
it
is
still
i
should
like
to
know
why
you
want
me
to
throw
jewdwine
over
hang
jewdwine
i
said
i
glad
you
admit
the
distinction
i
admit
it
why
do
you
want
me
to
throw
the
thing
over
then
do
you
mean
that
i
ca
work
for
you
and
jewdwine
at
the
same
time
i
never
said
anything
about
jewdwine
at
all
but
if
you
will
have
it
i
ca
say
i
consider
the
connection
desirable
for
the
editor
of
i
think
i
the
best
judge
of
that
i
said
for
the
editor
of
for
the
editor
of
then
why
not
ours
is
a
poor
but
honest
paper
said
maddox
with
his
devilish
twinkle
i
do
see
how
i
can
very
well
be
the
editor
of
so
long
as
it
insists
on
shying
a
dead
cat
every
week
at
the
editor
of
we
have
never
mentioned
the
editor
of
still
if
you
can
induce
rankin
to
give
up
his
little
jest
the
cat
is
certainly
very
dead
by
this
time
he
have
to
give
it
up
if
you
make
me
editor
you
better
tell
him
so
i
shall
all
right
rickets
only
wait
till
you
editor
then
you
can
put
as
much
side
on
as
you
like
good
heavens
did
you
ever
see
me
put
on
side
well
i
seen
you
strike
an
attitude
occasionally
all
my
attitudes
put
together
hardly
amount
to
side
they
do
if
they
assume
that
they
going
to
affect
the
attitude
of
our
paper
i
did
know
it
had
one
it
has
a
very
decided
attitude
with
regard
to
the
ethics
of
reviewing
and
whatever
else
you
make
it
give
up
it
not
going
to
give
up
that
ricky
does
put
on
side
side
would
be
fatal
to
any
freedom
in
the
handling
of
dead
cats
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
makes
its
moral
being
its
prime
care
but
there
are
some
abuses
which
it
lives
to
expose
though
the
exposure
help
it
much
to
live
oh
i
say
maddy
that
what
keeps
you
going
my
poems
would
have
sunk
you
long
ago
if
it
had
been
for
your
thrilling
personalities
personalities
or
no
personalities
what
i
mean
to
rub
into
you
is
that
is
impartial
it
only
impartial
review
in
this
country
it
has
always
reserved
to
itself
an
absolutely
untrammelled
hand
in
the
shying
of
dead
cats
and
because
a
man
happens
to
be
a
friend
of
the
editor
it
no
guarantee
whatever
that
he
wo
have
one
slung
at
him
the
minute
he
deserves
it
his
only
security
is
to
perpetrate
some
crime
so
atrocious
that
we
publish
his
name
for
fear
of
letting
ourselves
in
for
an
action
for
libel
your
attitude
to
jewdwine
is
naturally
personal
ours
is
not
i
should
have
thought
you
have
been
the
first
to
see
that
i
do
see
what
you
got
against
him
to
begin
with
i
wish
tell
me
plainly
what
it
is
if
you
will
have
it
it
simply
this
he
is
honest
what
the
devil
you
mean
i
mean
what
you
mean
when
you
say
a
woman
is
honest
as
you
so
often
remarked
there
such
a
thing
as
intellectual
chastity
some
people
have
it
and
some
have
not
you
have
it
my
dear
rickets
in
perfection
not
to
say
excess
but
most
of
us
manage
to
lose
it
more
or
less
as
we
go
on
it
a
deuced
hard
thing
i
can
tell
you
for
any
editor
to
keep
and
jewdwine
i
afraid
has
latterly
been
induced
to
part
with
it
to
a
considerable
a
very
considerable
extent
it
a
thousand
pities
for
jewdwine
had
the
makings
in
him
of
a
really
fine
critic
he
might
have
been
a
classic
if
he
died
soon
enough
he
a
classic
he
the
only
man
whose
opinion
really
worth
having
at
this
moment
whom
are
we
talking
about
jewdwine
or
the
editor
of
i
talking
about
jewdwine
i
happen
to
know
him
if
you
do
and
i
talking
about
the
other
fellow
whom
you
do
happen
to
know
a
little
bit
nobody
cares
a
tuppenny
damn
about
opinion
except
the
fools
who
read
it
and
the
knaves
who
buy
it
and
who
do
you
imagine
those
people
are
most
of
them
are
publishers
i
believe
but
a
good
few
are
authors
i
regret
to
say
authors
have
cheek
enough
for
most
things
but
i
should
like
to
see
one
suggesting
to
jewdwine
that
he
should
sell
him
his
opinion
my
dear
fellow
anybody
may
suggest
it
that
what
he
there
for
since
he
turned
his
opinion
on
to
the
streets
whether
you
get
a
pretty
opinion
or
not
depends
on
the
length
of
your
purse
why
do
you
call
it
bribery
at
once
because
bribery
too
harsh
a
term
to
apply
to
an
editor
semblable
mon
but
in
a
woman
or
a
parliamentary
candidate
it
might
possibly
be
called
corruption
thanks
well
you
made
me
a
very
generous
offer
maddox
so
generous
that
i
glad
you
explained
yourself
before
i
took
it
for
after
that
you
know
it
would
have
been
rather
awkward
for
me
to
have
to
tell
you
you
a
liar
you
consider
me
a
liar
do
you
said
maddox
in
a
mild
dispassionate
voice
certainly
i
do
when
you
say
these
thing
about
jewdwine
how
about
rankin
he
says
them
then
rankin
a
liar
too
and
stables
stables
if
he
says
them
my
dear
rickman
everybody
says
them
only
they
do
say
them
to
you
we
ca
all
be
liars
there
a
difference
i
admit
anybody
who
says
them
is
a
liar
and
anybody
who
says
them
to
is
a
d
d
liar
that
the
difference
whereupon
maddox
intimated
as
honour
indeed
compelled
him
that
rickman
was
the
sort
of
young
fool
for
which
there
is
no
salvation
and
by
the
time
rickman
had
replied
with
suitable
hyperbole
and
maddox
because
of
the
great
love
he
bore
to
rickman
had
observed
that
if
rickman
chose
to
cut
his
confused
throat
he
might
do
so
without
its
being
a
matter
of
permanent
regret
to
maddox
and
rickman
because
of
the
great
love
he
bore
to
maddox
had
suggested
his
immediate
departure
for
perdition
it
was
pretty
clearly
understood
that
rickman
himself
preferred
to
perish
everlastingly
perish
rather
than
be
connected
even
remotely
with
maddox
and
his
paper
and
on
that
understanding
they
separated
and
when
the
door
was
closed
between
them
rickman
realised
that
his
folly
was
even
as
maddox
had
described
it
in
one
night
and
at
a
crisis
of
his
finances
he
had
severed
himself
from
a
fairly
permanent
source
of
income
flung
up
the
most
desirable
chance
that
had
presented
itself
hitherto
in
his
career
and
quarrelled
disgracefully
and
disagreeably
with
his
best
friend
he
supposed
the
split
was
bound
to
come
but
if
he
could
only
have
staved
it
off
for
another
year
till
he
had
collected
that
seven
hundred
and
fifty
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
that
was
what
he
ought
to
have
done
he
ought
to
have
been
prudent
for
lucia
sake
and
on
the
top
of
it
all
came
the
terrible
reflection
was
it
really
worth
it
did
he
really
believe
in
jewdwine
or
had
he
sacrificed
himself
for
an
idea
chapter
lxvii
rickman
could
never
be
made
to
speak
of
the
quarrel
with
maddox
he
merely
mentioned
to
jewdwine
in
the
most
casual
manner
that
he
had
left
as
for
his
grounds
for
that
abrupt
departure
jewdwine
was
entirely
in
the
dark
it
was
lucia
that
enlightened
him
for
all
things
even
the
deep
things
of
journalism
sooner
or
later
come
to
light
rickman
before
the
quarrel
had
given
miss
roots
an
introduction
to
the
young
men
of
and
its
editor
had
taken
kindly
to
miss
roots
maddox
it
is
true
did
his
best
to
keep
the
matter
quiet
until
in
a
moment
of
expansion
he
allowed
that
shrewd
lady
to
lure
him
into
confidences
maddox
tried
to
take
it
and
present
it
philosophically
it
was
bound
to
happen
he
said
our
is
a
bad
hand
at
serving
two
masters
but
as
to
which
was
god
and
which
mammon
in
this
connection
he
modestly
reserved
his
opinion
jewdwine
name
was
carefully
avoided
but
miss
roots
was
left
in
no
doubt
as
to
the
subject
of
dispute
she
and
maddox
were
one
in
their
inextinguishable
enthusiasm
for
their
rickman
for
rickman
had
the
gift
the
rarest
of
all
gifts
of
uniting
the
hearts
that
loved
him
if
jewdwine
had
showed
anything
like
a
proper
appreciation
of
the
poet
maddox
would
have
spared
him
now
so
the
two
looked
at
each
other
with
eyes
that
plumbed
all
the
depths
of
the
unspoken
and
unspeakable
eyes
that
sent
out
a
twinkling
flash
of
admiration
as
they
agreed
that
it
was
just
like
rickman
that
phrase
was
for
ever
on
the
lips
of
his
admirers
a
testimony
to
the
fact
that
rickman
was
invariably
true
to
himself
he
was
being
true
to
himself
now
in
being
true
to
jewdwine
and
it
was
in
that
form
that
the
tale
went
round
i
ca
tell
you
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
it
wrote
miss
roots
to
lucia
but
he
is
paying
for
his
loyalty
to
jewdwine
and
lucia
with
equal
pride
in
her
cousin
and
her
friend
repeated
it
to
kitty
palliser
who
repeated
it
to
somebody
else
with
the
comment
i
not
surprised
to
hear
it
and
somebody
else
repeated
it
in
a
good
many
quarters
without
any
comment
at
all
for
everybody
but
lucia
understood
that
it
spoke
for
itself
and
nobody
understood
it
better
than
jewdwine
when
his
cousin
said
you
be
nice
to
him
horace
wo
you
he
is
suffering
for
his
loyalty
to
you
lucia
herself
had
adopted
a
theory
which
she
now
set
forth
reluctantly
by
reason
of
the
horrible
light
it
threw
on
human
nature
maddox
whoever
he
might
be
was
of
course
jealous
of
horace
it
was
a
shocking
theory
but
it
was
the
only
one
which
made
these
complications
clear
to
her
but
jewdwine
had
no
need
of
theories
or
explanations
he
understood
he
knew
that
a
certain
prejudice
not
to
say
suspicion
attached
to
him
ideas
not
very
favourable
to
his
character
as
a
journalist
were
in
the
air
and
as
his
mind
in
this
respect
constitutionally
susceptible
had
seldom
been
able
to
resist
ideas
in
the
air
there
were
moments
when
his
own
judgment
wavered
he
was
beginning
to
suspect
himself
he
was
not
sure
and
if
he
had
been
he
would
not
have
acted
on
that
certainty
for
he
had
never
possessed
the
courage
of
his
opinions
but
it
had
come
to
this
that
jewdwine
the
pure
the
incorruptible
was
actually
uncertain
whether
he
had
or
had
not
taken
a
bribe
as
he
lay
awake
in
bed
at
four
in
the
morning
his
conscience
would
suggest
to
him
that
he
had
done
this
thing
but
at
noon
in
the
office
of
his
robust
common
sense
then
like
the
sun
in
the
ascendant
boldly
protested
that
he
had
done
nothing
of
the
sort
he
had
merely
made
certain
not
very
unusual
concessions
to
the
interests
of
his
journal
in
doing
so
he
had
of
course
set
aside
his
artistic
conscience
an
artistic
conscience
being
a
private
luxury
incompatible
with
the
workings
of
a
large
corporate
concern
he
was
bound
to
disregard
it
in
loyalty
to
his
employers
and
his
public
they
expected
certain
things
of
him
and
not
others
it
was
different
in
the
unexciting
days
of
the
old
it
would
be
different
now
if
he
could
afford
to
run
a
paper
of
his
own
dedicated
to
the
service
of
the
absolute
but
jewdwine
was
no
longer
the
servant
of
the
absolute
he
was
the
servant
and
the
mouthpiece
of
a
policy
that
in
his
heart
he
abhorred
irretrievably
committed
to
a
programme
that
was
concerned
with
no
absolute
beyond
the
absolute
necessity
of
increasing
the
circulation
of
such
a
journal
only
existed
on
the
assumption
that
its
working
expenses
were
covered
by
the
advertisements
of
certain
publishing
houses
but
if
this
necessity
committed
him
to
a
more
courteous
attitude
than
he
might
otherwise
have
adopted
towards
the
works
issued
by
those
houses
that
was
not
saying
that
he
was
in
their
pay
he
was
of
course
in
the
pay
of
his
own
publishers
but
so
was
every
man
who
drew
a
salary
under
the
same
conditions
and
if
those
gentlemen
finding
their
editor
an
even
more
competent
person
than
they
had
at
first
perceived
were
in
the
habit
of
increasing
his
salary
in
proportion
to
his
competence
that
was
only
the
very
correct
and
natural
expression
of
their
good
opinion
whatever
he
had
thought
of
himself
at
four
in
the
morning
by
four
in
the
afternoon
jewdwine
took
an
extremely
lenient
not
to
say
favourable
view
unfortunately
he
had
not
the
courage
of
that
opinion
either
therefore
he
was
profoundly
touched
by
this
final
instance
of
rickman
devotion
and
all
that
it
argued
of
reckless
and
inspired
belief
in
the
six
months
that
followed
he
saw
more
of
rickman
than
he
had
seen
in
as
many
years
whenever
he
had
a
slack
evening
he
would
ask
him
to
dinner
and
let
him
sit
talking
on
far
into
the
night
he
was
afraid
of
being
left
alone
with
that
uncomfortable
doubt
that
torturing
suspicion
rickman
brought
with
him
an
atmosphere
charged
with
stimulating
conviction
and
in
his
presence
jewdwine
breathed
freely
and
unafraid
he
felt
himself
no
longer
the
ambiguous
jewdwine
that
he
was
but
the
noble
incorruptible
jewdwine
that
he
had
been
up
there
in
the
privacy
of
his
study
jewdwine
let
himself
go
to
that
listener
he
was
free
to
speak
as
a
critic
noble
and
incorruptible
but
there
were
moments
painful
for
both
men
when
he
would
pause
gripped
by
his
doubt
in
the
full
swing
of
some
high
deliverance
when
he
looked
at
rickman
with
a
pathetic
anxious
gaze
as
if
uncertain
whether
he
were
not
presuming
too
far
on
a
character
that
he
held
only
at
the
mercy
of
his
friend
belief
though
as
yet
he
was
not
fully
aware
of
the
extent
to
which
he
relied
on
that
belief
there
could
hardly
have
been
a
stronger
tie
than
that
which
now
bound
him
to
his
subordinate
he
would
have
shrunk
from
loosing
it
lest
he
should
cut
himself
off
from
some
pure
source
of
immortality
lest
he
should
break
the
last
link
between
his
soul
and
the
sustaining
and
divine
reality
it
was
as
if
through
rickman
he
remained
attached
to
the
beauty
which
he
still
loved
and
to
the
truth
which
he
still
darkly
discerned
in
any
case
he
could
not
have
suffered
him
to
go
unrewarded
he
owed
that
to
himself
to
the
queer
personal
decency
which
he
still
managed
to
preserve
after
all
his
flounderings
in
the
slough
of
journalism
it
was
intolerable
to
his
pride
that
rickman
should
be
in
any
pecuniary
embarrassment
through
his
uncompromising
devotion
he
hardly
knew
whether
he
was
the
more
pleased
because
rickman
had
stuck
to
him
or
because
he
had
thrown
his
other
friends
over
he
had
never
quite
forgiven
him
that
divided
fealty
he
cared
nothing
for
an
allegiance
that
he
had
had
to
share
with
maddox
and
his
gang
but
now
that
rickman
was
once
more
exclusively
indisputably
his
he
was
in
honour
bound
to
cherish
and
protect
him
jewdwine
was
frequently
visited
by
these
wakenings
of
the
feudal
instinct
that
slept
secretly
in
his
blood
if
he
could
not
make
up
to
rickman
for
the
loss
of
the
proposed
editorship
he
saw
to
it
that
he
was
kept
well
supplied
with
lucrative
work
on
his
own
paper
as
an
even
stronger
proof
of
his
esteem
he
allowed
him
for
the
first
time
a
certain
authority
and
an
unfettered
hand
for
six
months
rickman
luxuriated
in
power
and
increase
of
leisure
and
of
pay
if
the
pay
was
insufficient
to
cover
all
his
losses
the
leisure
was
invaluable
it
enabled
him
to
get
on
with
his
tragedy
now
if
rickman
had
been
prudent
he
would
have
finished
his
tragedy
then
and
there
and
got
it
published
in
all
haste
for
there
is
no
doubt
that
if
any
work
of
his
had
been
given
to
the
world
any
time
within
those
six
months
jewdwine
would
have
declared
the
faith
that
was
in
him
whatever
the
merits
of
the
work
he
would
have
celebrated
its
appearance
by
a
sounding
feast
of
trumpets
in
he
would
have
done
anything
to
strengthen
the
tie
that
attached
him
to
the
sources
of
his
spiritual
content
but
rickman
was
not
prudent
he
let
the
golden
hours
slip
by
while
he
sat
polishing
up
his
blank
verse
as
if
he
had
all
eternity
before
him
meanwhile
he
did
all
he
could
for
jewdwine
jewdwine
indeed
could
not
have
done
a
better
thing
for
himself
than
in
giving
rickman
that
free
hand
in
six
months
there
was
a
marked
improvement
in
the
tone
of
and
the
reputation
of
its
editor
and
but
for
the
unexpected
which
is
always
happening
jewdwine
might
in
the
long
run
have
emerged
without
a
stain
nothing
in
fact
could
have
been
more
utterly
unforeseen
and
yet
in
reviewing
all
the
steps
which
led
to
the
ultimate
catastrophe
rickman
said
to
himself
that
nothing
would
have
been
more
consistent
and
inevitable
it
came
about
first
of
all
through
a
freak
a
wanton
freak
of
fate
in
the
form
of
a
beardless
poet
a
discovery
not
of
jewdwine
nor
of
rickman
but
of
miss
roots
that
miss
roots
could
make
a
discovery
clearly
indicated
the
finger
of
fate
miss
roots
promptly
asked
rickman
to
dinner
and
presented
to
him
the
discovery
beardless
breathless
also
and
hectic
wearing
an
unclean
shirt
and
a
suit
of
frayed
shoddy
he
came
away
from
that
dinner
that
embarrassing
palpitating
encounter
with
a
slender
sheaf
of
verses
in
his
pocket
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
read
them
nor
to
see
the
unforeseen
again
that
the
verses
would
live
longer
than
their
maker
they
were
beardless
breathless
and
hectic
like
the
boy
but
nobody
could
have
been
keener
than
rickman
to
recognize
the
immortal
adolescence
the
swift
panting
of
the
pursuing
god
the
burning
of
the
inextinguishable
flame
he
wrote
a
letter
to
him
several
letters
out
of
the
fulness
of
his
heart
then
maddox
to
whom
he
had
not
spoken
since
the
day
of
their
falling
out
came
up
to
him
at
the
junior
journalists
shook
his
hand
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
thanked
him
for
his
appreciation
of
young
paterson
he
said
that
it
had
put
new
life
into
the
boy
they
made
it
up
over
young
paterson
and
that
was
another
step
towards
the
inevitable
conclusion
the
next
step
was
that
somebody
who
was
paying
for
the
boy
bills
paid
also
for
the
publication
of
his
poems
they
arrived
this
of
course
was
only
to
be
expected
at
the
office
of
the
slender
sheaf
grown
slenderer
by
some
omissions
which
rickman
had
advised
but
it
was
fate
that
contrived
that
they
should
arrive
in
the
same
week
with
a
volume
by
no
means
slender
a
volume
of
poems
issued
by
the
publishers
of
and
written
by
a
friend
and
an
influential
friend
of
the
editor
therein
were
the
last
sweet
pipings
of
the
pastoral
fulcher
no
other
hand
but
jewdwine
as
jewdwine
sorrowfully
owned
could
have
done
anything
for
this
work
and
he
meant
to
have
devoted
a
flattering
article
to
it
in
the
next
number
but
in
the
arrangements
of
the
unforeseen
it
was
further
provided
that
jewdwine
should
be
disabled
at
what
he
playfully
called
the
critical
moment
by
an
attack
of
influenza
the
two
volumes
the
slender
and
the
stout
were
forwarded
to
rickman
in
the
same
parcel
and
jewdwine
in
a
note
discreetly
worded
threw
himself
and
the
poems
of
his
influential
friend
on
rickman
mercy
would
rickman
deal
with
the
big
book
he
would
see
for
himself
that
it
a
big
book
he
gave
him
as
usual
a
perfectly
free
hand
as
to
space
but
he
thought
it
might
be
well
to
mention
that
the
book
to
have
had
a
article
all
to
itself
he
drew
rickman
attention
to
the
fact
that
it
was
published
by
so
and
so
and
hoped
that
he
might
for
once
at
least
rely
on
his
discretion
perhaps
as
he
was
reviewing
the
work
of
a
brother
bard
it
would
be
better
to
keep
the
article
anonymous
there
was
nothing
coarse
about
jewdwine
methods
through
all
his
career
he
remained
refined
and
fastidious
and
his
natural
instincts
forbade
him
to
give
a
stronger
hint
unfortunately
in
this
instance
refinement
had
led
him
into
a
certain
ambiguity
of
phrase
on
this
ambiguity
rickman
leapt
with
a
grin
of
diabolical
delight
he
may
have
had
some
dim
idea
that
it
would
be
his
shelter
in
the
day
of
rebuke
but
all
he
could
clearly
think
of
as
he
held
the
boy
frail
palpitating
volume
in
his
hand
was
that
he
had
but
that
moment
in
which
to
praise
him
this
was
his
unique
and
perfect
opportunity
the
only
sort
of
opportunity
that
he
was
not
likely
to
let
slip
deus
vult
perdere
prius
and
it
really
looked
as
if
madness
had
come
upon
rickman
in
the
loneliness
and
intoxication
of
his
power
with
those
two
volumes
of
poetry
before
him
a
small
one
by
a
rank
outsider
unknown
unkempt
and
unprotected
a
boy
from
whom
no
more
was
to
be
expected
seeing
that
he
was
about
to
depart
out
of
the
world
where
editors
are
powerful
and
one
a
large
considerable
volume
by
a
person
eminent
already
in
that
world
and
with
many
years
of
poetry
and
influence
before
him
he
gave
reckless
of
all
proportion
the
article
to
the
slender
volume
and
the
paragraph
to
the
stout
that
was
what
he
did
he
the
of
the
paragraph
the
less
said
the
better
as
for
the
article
it
was
such
a
song
of
jubilation
as
one
poet
sings
over
the
genius
of
another
and
nothing
that
he
had
ever
done
for
delighted
him
so
much
as
the
making
of
it
he
sent
the
proofs
to
jewdwine
as
usual
with
a
note
here
they
are
i
i
been
discreet
done
what
i
could
for
fulcher
but
as
you
see
i
dealt
nobly
with
young
paterson
as
he
deserves
as
he
heard
nothing
from
jewdwine
he
could
only
suppose
that
the
chief
was
satisfied
and
he
could
not
help
reflecting
with
some
complacency
that
no
doubt
old
maddox
would
be
satisfied
too
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
that
he
was
cut
by
maddox
at
the
junior
journalists
it
was
on
a
saturday
and
number
had
appeared
the
night
before
cut
unmistakably
with
a
thrust
from
the
blue
eyes
and
an
expressive
turning
of
the
enormous
shoulders
a
number
once
issued
from
his
hands
rickman
never
looked
at
it
again
if
he
could
help
it
and
he
never
troubled
to
look
at
it
now
he
simply
regarded
maddox
behaviour
as
unaccountable
in
the
hope
of
lighting
on
some
explanation
he
called
at
tavistock
place
one
sunday
afternoon
at
a
time
when
he
was
pretty
sure
of
finding
miss
roots
alone
he
wanted
to
know
he
said
what
was
the
matter
with
maddy
apparently
miss
roots
had
something
the
matter
with
her
too
for
her
only
answer
was
to
hand
him
stiffly
a
copy
of
with
the
pages
scored
in
blue
pencil
at
his
own
article
he
took
it
with
a
radiant
and
confiding
smile
a
smile
that
assumed
such
a
thoroughly
delightful
understanding
between
him
and
miss
roots
that
the
little
lady
who
had
evidently
counted
on
a
very
different
effect
was
put
to
some
intellectual
confusion
she
noticed
that
as
he
read
the
smile
vanished
and
gave
place
first
to
an
expression
of
absolute
bewilderment
and
then
to
a
furious
flush
whether
of
shame
or
indignation
she
could
not
tell
but
it
looked
again
to
her
confusion
uncommonly
like
both
i
see
he
said
quietly
and
laid
the
paper
aside
what
he
had
seen
was
that
save
for
a
few
ingenious
transpositions
the
two
reviews
stood
very
much
as
he
had
written
them
the
only
striking
alteration
was
that
fulcher
had
got
the
article
and
young
paterson
the
paragraph
oh
you
see
do
you
said
miss
roots
bitterly
that
more
than
i
do
i
see
there
been
some
astonishing
mistake
for
one
moment
he
exonerated
jewdwine
and
embraced
the
wild
hypothesis
of
a
error
he
took
back
the
accursed
journal
as
he
held
it
his
hand
trembled
uncontrollably
he
glanced
over
the
notices
again
no
it
was
not
after
this
fashion
that
the
printers
of
the
were
wont
to
err
he
recognized
the
familiar
hand
of
the
censor
though
it
had
never
before
accomplished
such
an
incredible
piece
of
editing
as
this
and
yet
it
was
in
strict
accordance
with
the
old
tradition
the
staff
of
knew
that
before
a
line
of
theirs
was
printed
it
had
to
pass
under
their
editor
reforming
hand
that
was
the
understood
condition
on
which
they
wrote
for
him
at
all
it
was
the
method
by
which
jewdwine
maintained
the
unity
of
his
empire
but
in
the
case
of
rickman
he
either
forbore
to
exercise
his
privilege
or
exercised
it
in
such
a
manner
as
preserved
the
individuality
of
the
poet
style
like
some
imperial
conqueror
jewdwine
had
absorbed
the
literary
spirit
of
the
man
he
conquered
and
bore
the
stamp
of
rickman
for
all
time
so
now
the
style
of
the
articles
remained
intact
they
might
have
passed
equally
for
the
work
of
rickman
or
of
jewdwine
i
suppose
he
said
helplessly
it
is
a
little
short
short
you
were
bound
to
make
it
long
but
there
was
no
occasion
to
be
so
contemptuous
contemptuous
good
god
that
what
it
amounts
to
when
you
so
insufferably
polite
oh
yes
he
recognized
it
the
diabolical
urbanity
that
had
seemed
the
very
choicest
method
of
dealing
with
fulcher
politeness
was
not
exactly
all
you
led
us
to
expect
from
you
he
passed
his
hand
wearily
over
his
forehead
and
his
eyes
miss
roots
had
a
moment
of
compunction
she
thought
of
all
that
he
had
done
for
her
he
had
delivered
her
from
her
labours
in
the
museum
he
had
introduced
her
to
the
young
men
of
and
had
made
maddox
send
her
many
books
to
review
he
had
lifted
her
from
the
obscurity
that
threatened
to
engulf
her
and
he
had
done
more
for
her
than
this
he
had
given
her
back
her
youth
and
intellect
he
had
made
her
life
a
joy
instead
of
a
terror
to
her
but
miss
roots
was
just
the
agony
on
his
face
would
have
melted
her
heart
but
for
another
agony
that
she
saw
if
the
poor
boy
knew
that
had
written
that
paragraph
he
need
know
unless
some
kind
friend
goes
and
tells
him
it
signed
no
i
do
wonder
that
you
were
ashamed
to
put
your
name
to
it
he
rose
to
go
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
queer
little
look
half
penetrating
and
half
pleading
and
held
out
her
hand
well
she
said
what
am
i
to
say
if
he
asks
me
if
you
wrote
it
can
you
deny
it
no
he
said
curtly
i
ca
deny
it
and
you
ca
explain
it
no
and
i
ca
explain
it
surely
he
said
with
a
horrible
attempt
at
laughter
it
speaks
for
itself
it
does
indeed
keith
and
maddox
to
whom
miss
roots
related
the
substance
of
that
interview
echoed
her
sentiment
it
does
indeed
of
all
that
brilliant
band
of
young
men
lured
by
journalism
to
ruin
they
looked
on
their
rickman
as
the
most
splendid
the
most
tragic
chapter
lxviii
up
till
now
it
had
never
occurred
to
rickman
that
his
connection
with
could
directly
damage
him
still
less
that
jewdwine
could
personally
inflict
a
blow
but
the
injury
now
done
to
him
was
monstrous
and
intolerable
jewdwine
had
hurt
him
in
a
peculiarly
delicate
and
shrinking
place
because
his
nature
was
not
originally
magnificent
in
virtue
of
another
sort
it
was
before
all
things
necessary
that
he
should
perserve
his
intellectual
chastity
that
quality
went
deeper
than
the
intellect
it
was
one
with
a
sense
of
honour
so
fine
that
a
touch
impalpable
to
ordinary
men
was
felt
by
it
as
a
laceration
and
a
stain
he
walked
up
to
hampstead
that
sunday
evening
taking
the
hill
at
a
round
swinging
pace
not
all
the
ardour
and
enthusiasm
of
his
youth
had
ever
carried
him
there
with
such
an
impetus
as
did
his
burning
indignation
against
jewdwine
and
as
he
went
the
spirit
of
youth
the
spirit
of
young
paterson
went
beside
him
and
breathed
upon
the
flame
and
yet
he
was
the
same
man
who
only
an
hour
ago
had
been
defending
jewdwine
honour
at
the
expense
of
his
own
without
a
thought
that
in
so
defending
it
he
was
doing
anything
in
the
least
quixotic
or
remarkable
he
had
done
nothing
he
had
simply
refrained
at
a
critical
moment
from
giving
him
away
maddox
was
jewdwine
enemy
and
to
have
given
jewdwine
away
at
that
moment
would
have
meant
delivering
him
over
to
maddox
to
destroy
no
when
he
thought
of
it
he
could
hardly
say
he
had
defended
his
friend
honour
at
the
expense
of
his
own
for
jewdwine
honour
was
lucia
and
lucia
was
not
jewdwine
but
his
indistinguishably
inseparably
his
but
though
he
was
not
going
to
give
jewdwine
up
to
maddox
he
was
going
to
give
him
up
it
might
come
to
the
same
thing
he
could
imagine
that
to
anybody
who
chose
to
put
two
and
two
together
an
open
rupture
would
give
him
away
as
completely
as
if
he
had
accused
him
in
so
many
words
that
of
course
he
could
not
help
there
was
a
point
beyond
which
his
honour
refused
to
identify
itself
with
jewdwine
he
had
never
felt
a
moment
hesitation
upon
that
point
for
in
his
heart
he
condemned
his
friend
far
more
severely
than
maddox
could
have
condemned
anybody
he
had
a
greater
capacity
for
disgust
than
maddox
he
would
draw
up
writhing
at
trifles
over
which
maddox
would
merely
shrug
his
shoulders
and
pass
on
in
this
instance
maddox
whose
celtic
soul
grew
wanton
at
the
prospect
of
a
fight
would
have
fallen
upon
jewdwine
with
an
infernal
joy
but
he
would
have
been
the
first
to
deprecate
rickman
decision
as
absurd
as
for
rankin
of
stables
instead
of
flying
into
a
passion
they
would
in
similar
circumstances
have
sat
still
and
smiled
if
it
had
not
been
for
young
paterson
rickman
would
have
smiled
too
even
if
he
had
been
unable
to
sit
still
for
his
vision
of
fulcher
pocketing
the
carefully
selected
praise
intended
for
paterson
was
purely
and
supremely
comic
so
delightful
in
fact
that
he
could
have
embraced
jewdwine
for
providing
it
but
paterson
who
had
looked
to
him
as
to
the
giver
of
life
or
death
paterson
on
his
taking
fulcher
paragraph
to
himself
and
wondering
whether
it
were
indeed
rickman
who
had
done
this
thing
the
thought
of
paterson
was
too
painful
to
be
borne
honour
or
no
honour
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
work
for
jewdwine
after
that
he
had
got
to
make
that
clear
to
jewdwine
and
anything
more
unpleasant
than
the
coming
interview
he
could
not
well
conceive
unpleasantness
you
would
have
said
was
far
from
jewdwine
mind
that
sunday
evening
he
himself
suggested
nothing
of
the
sort
he
was
in
his
study
sitting
in
an
armchair
with
a
shawl
over
his
knees
smoking
a
cigarette
and
looking
more
pathetically
refined
than
ever
after
his
influenza
when
rickman
burst
in
upon
his
peace
he
was
so
frankly
glad
to
see
him
that
his
greeting
alone
was
enough
to
disarm
prejudice
it
seemed
likely
that
he
would
carry
off
the
honours
of
the
discussion
by
remaining
severely
polite
while
rickman
grew
more
and
more
perturbed
and
heated
rickman
however
gained
at
the
outset
by
making
straight
for
his
point
as
jewdwine
gave
him
no
opening
he
had
to
make
one
and
make
it
as
early
as
possible
before
the
great
amenities
had
time
to
lure
him
from
the
track
i
wish
said
he
abruptly
you
tell
me
what
was
wrong
with
those
reviews
of
mine
that
you
found
it
necessary
to
alter
them
the
reviews
oh
the
reviews
were
all
right
excellent
material
they
only
wanted
a
little
editing
do
you
mind
telling
me
what
you
mean
by
editing
is
the
last
point
an
editor
is
competent
to
explain
all
the
same
i
like
to
hear
what
you
got
to
say
i
think
admit
that
you
owe
me
some
explanation
my
dear
fellow
sit
down
wo
you
i
admit
nothing
of
the
sort
jewdwine
no
longer
stood
on
his
dignity
he
lay
back
on
it
lounged
on
it
stretched
all
his
graceful
length
upon
it
infinitely
at
ease
time
had
mellowed
his
manners
and
made
them
incomparably
gentle
and
humane
you
seem
to
think
i
took
a
liberty
with
your
articles
i
did
i
merely
exercised
an
ancient
editorial
right
i
could
possibly
have
let
them
be
printed
as
they
stood
conceive
my
feelings
if
i
had
to
sit
next
to
fulcher
at
dinner
that
evening
it
might
easily
have
happened
it
all
very
well
for
you
rickman
you
young
and
irresponsible
and
you
have
got
to
sit
next
to
fulcher
at
dinner
but
you
own
that
it
would
have
been
rather
an
awkward
situation
for
me
i
can
forgive
you
fulcher
but
i
ca
forgive
you
paterson
and
i
could
have
forgiven
you
paterson
but
i
could
forgive
you
fulcher
do
you
see
he
allowed
a
few
moments
for
reflection
and
continued
of
course
i
understand
your
feelings
in
fact
i
sympathize
profoundly
as
a
rule
i
never
dream
of
touching
anything
with
your
signature
i
far
too
great
a
reverence
for
style
style
be
d
for
all
i
care
you
may
cut
up
my
style
till
you
ca
tell
it
from
fulcher
i
object
to
your
transposing
my
meaning
to
suit
your
own
honestly
jewdwine
i
rather
write
like
fulcher
than
write
as
you
made
me
appear
to
have
written
my
dear
rickman
that
where
you
make
the
mistake
you
do
appear
at
all
he
smiled
with
urbane
tolerance
of
the
error
the
editor
as
you
know
is
solely
responsible
for
unsigned
reviews
so
far
jewdwine
had
come
off
well
he
had
always
a
tremendous
advantage
in
his
hereditary
manners
however
right
you
had
been
to
start
with
his
imperturbable
refinement
put
you
grossly
in
the
wrong
and
at
this
point
rickman
gave
himself
away
what
the
good
of
that
said
he
if
young
paterson
believes
i
wrote
them
young
paterson
is
entitled
to
any
belief
in
the
matter
but
he
knew
there
was
a
shade
of
genuine
annoyance
on
jewdwine
face
oh
of
course
if
you
told
him
that
you
were
the
author
rather
awkward
for
you
but
it
hardly
my
fault
i
sorry
rickman
but
you
really
a
little
indiscreet
i
wish
i
could
explain
your
behaviour
in
the
same
way
come
since
you
so
keen
on
explanations
how
do
you
propose
to
explain
your
own
i
gave
you
certain
instructions
and
what
right
had
you
to
go
beyond
them
not
to
say
against
them
what
earthly
right
had
you
to
make
me
say
the
exact
opposite
of
what
i
did
say
but
i
did
go
against
your
instructions
here
they
are
he
produced
them
you
see
that
you
gave
me
a
perfectly
free
hand
as
to
space
jewdwine
looked
keenly
at
him
you
knew
perfectly
well
what
i
meant
and
you
took
advantage
of
of
a
trifling
ambiguity
in
my
phrasing
to
do
as
you
would
say
the
exact
opposite
that
was
hardly
what
i
expected
of
you
as
he
spoke
jewdwine
drew
his
shawl
up
about
his
waist
thus
delicately
drawing
attention
to
his
enfeebled
state
the
gesture
seemed
to
convict
rickman
of
taking
advantage
not
only
of
his
phrase
but
of
his
influenza
behaviour
superlatively
base
i
can
give
you
a
perfectly
clear
statement
of
the
case
you
carefully
suppressed
friend
and
you
boomed
your
own
for
all
you
were
worth
naturally
i
reversed
your
judgment
of
course
if
you
had
told
me
you
wanted
to
do
a
little
on
your
own
account
i
should
have
been
only
too
delighted
but
i
always
understood
that
you
disapproved
of
the
practice
so
i
do
paterson
is
a
friend
of
mine
he
your
friend
friend
then
i
think
maddox
might
have
been
left
to
look
after
his
own
man
rickman
rose
hastily
as
if
he
were
no
longer
able
to
sit
still
and
bear
it
jewdwine
he
said
and
his
voice
had
the
vibration
which
the
master
had
once
found
so
irresistible
have
you
read
young
poems
yes
i
read
them
and
what
is
your
honest
your
private
opinion
of
them
i
not
a
fool
rickman
my
private
opinion
of
them
is
the
same
as
yours
what
an
admission
but
said
jewdwine
suavely
that
not
the
sort
of
opinion
my
public
the
public
that
pays
for
pays
to
have
you
mean
it
the
sort
of
opinion
i
paid
to
give
well
broadly
speaking
of
course
there
are
exceptions
and
paterson
in
other
circumstances
might
have
been
one
of
them
that
very
much
what
i
do
mean
then
i
awfully
sorry
jewdwine
but
if
that
so
i
ca
go
on
working
for
i
must
give
it
up
in
fact
that
really
what
i
came
to
say
jewdwine
too
had
risen
with
an
air
of
relief
being
anxious
to
end
an
interview
which
was
becoming
more
uncomfortable
than
he
cared
for
he
had
stood
gazing
under
drooping
eyelids
at
his
disciple
feet
nobody
would
have
been
more
surprised
than
jewdwine
if
you
had
suggested
to
him
that
he
could
have
any
feeling
about
looking
anybody
in
the
face
but
at
that
last
incredible
impossible
speech
of
his
he
raised
his
eyes
and
fixed
them
on
rickman
for
a
moment
in
that
moment
many
things
were
revealed
to
him
he
turned
and
stood
with
his
back
to
rickman
staring
through
the
open
window
all
that
he
saw
there
the
quiet
walled
garden
the
rows
of
elms
on
the
terrace
beside
it
the
dim
green
of
the
heath
and
the
steep
unscaleable
grey
blue
barrier
of
the
sky
had
taken
on
an
unfamiliar
aspect
as
it
were
a
tragic
simplicity
and
vastness
for
these
things
once
so
restfully
indifferent
had
in
a
moment
become
the
background
of
his
spiritual
agony
a
scene
where
his
soul
appeared
to
him
standing
out
suddenly
shelterless
naked
and
alone
no
if
it
only
been
alone
but
that
was
the
peculiar
horror
of
it
he
could
have
borne
it
but
for
the
presence
of
the
other
man
who
had
called
forth
the
appalling
vision
and
remained
a
spectator
of
it
there
was
at
least
this
much
comfort
for
him
in
his
pangs
he
knew
that
a
man
of
coarser
fibre
would
neither
have
felt
nor
understood
them
but
it
was
impossible
for
jewdwine
to
do
an
ignoble
thing
and
not
to
suffer
it
was
the
innermost
delicacy
of
his
soul
that
made
it
writhe
under
the
destiny
he
had
thrust
upon
it
and
in
the
same
instant
he
recognized
and
acknowledged
the
greatness
of
the
man
with
whom
he
had
to
do
acknowledged
not
grudgingly
not
in
spite
of
himself
but
because
of
himself
because
of
that
finer
soul
within
his
soul
which
spoke
the
truth
in
secret
being
born
to
recognize
great
things
and
admire
them
he
wondered
now
how
he
could
ever
have
mistaken
rickman
he
perceived
the
origin
and
significance
of
his
attitude
of
disparagement
of
doubt
it
dated
from
a
certain
hot
july
afternoon
eight
years
ago
when
he
lay
under
a
in
the
garden
of
court
house
and
lucia
had
insisted
on
talking
about
the
poet
displaying
an
enthusiasm
too
ardent
to
be
borne
he
had
meant
well
by
rickman
but
lucia
ardour
had
somehow
put
him
off
had
had
the
same
effect
though
for
a
totally
different
reason
and
so
it
had
gone
on
he
had
said
to
himself
that
if
other
people
were
going
to
take
rickman
that
way
he
could
no
longer
feel
the
same
peculiar
interest
he
turned
back
again
do
you
really
mean
it
said
he
i
afraid
i
do
you
mean
that
you
intend
to
give
up
reviewing
for
i
mean
that
after
this
i
ca
have
anything
more
to
do
with
it
he
means
thought
jewdwine
that
he
wo
have
anything
more
to
do
with
me
and
rickman
saw
that
he
was
understood
he
wondered
how
jewdwine
would
take
it
he
took
it
nobly
well
he
said
i
sorry
but
if
you
must
go
you
must
to
tell
the
truth
my
dear
fellow
at
this
rate
you
know
i
could
afford
to
keep
you
i
wish
i
could
you
are
not
the
only
thing
i
ca
afford
he
said
it
with
a
certain
emotion
not
very
successfully
concealed
beneath
his
smile
rickman
was
about
to
go
but
he
detained
him
wait
one
minute
do
you
mind
telling
me
whether
you
any
regular
sources
of
income
besides
well
not
at
the
moment
and
supposing
none
arise
i
must
risk
it
you
seem
to
have
a
positive
mania
for
taking
risks
yes
that
was
rickman
all
over
he
found
a
brilliant
joy
in
the
excitement
he
was
in
love
with
danger
oh
well
sometimes
you
know
you
to
take
them
happy
rickman
the
things
that
were
so
difficult
and
complicated
to
jewdwine
were
so
simple
so
incontestable
to
him
some
people
rickman
would
say
you
were
a
fool
he
sighed
and
the
sigh
was
a
tribute
his
envy
paid
to
rickman
foolishness
i
wo
offer
an
opinion
the
event
will
prove
it
wo
prove
anything
events
never
do
they
merely
happen
well
if
they
happen
wrong
and
i
can
help
you
you
only
got
to
come
to
me
never
in
all
his
life
had
jewdwine
so
nearly
achieved
the
grace
of
humility
as
in
this
offer
of
his
help
he
would
have
given
anything
if
rickman
could
have
accepted
it
but
refusal
was
a
foregone
conclusion
and
yet
he
offered
it
thanks
thanks
awfully
it
was
rickman
who
appeared
nervous
and
ashamed
his
mouth
twitched
he
held
out
his
hand
abruptly
he
was
desperately
anxious
to
say
and
get
it
over
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
six
years
taking
leave
of
jewdwine
each
year
had
seen
the
departure
of
some
quality
he
had
known
him
by
he
wanted
to
have
done
with
it
now
for
ever
but
jewdwine
would
not
see
his
hand
he
turned
away
paced
the
floor
swung
back
on
a
hesitating
heel
and
approached
him
smiling
you
not
going
to
disappear
altogether
are
you
you
turn
up
again
and
let
me
know
how
you
getting
on
to
rickman
there
was
something
tragic
and
retrospective
in
smile
it
had
no
joy
in
it
but
an
appeal
rather
to
the
memory
of
what
he
had
been
he
found
it
irresistible
thanks
i
shall
get
on
all
right
but
i
turn
up
again
sometime
jewdwine
smile
parted
with
its
pathos
its
appeal
it
conveyed
a
promise
an
assurance
that
whatever
else
had
perished
in
him
his
friendship
was
not
dead
for
there
were
ways
apart
from
the
ways
of
journalism
in
which
jewdwine
could
be
noble
still
and
still
as
he
watched
departing
back
the
back
that
he
seemed
doomed
to
know
so
well
he
said
to
himself
he
magnificent
but
i
ca
afford
him
chapter
lxix
in
all
this
his
history
had
only
repeated
itself
when
six
years
ago
he
had
turned
his
back
on
rickman
he
had
made
it
inevitable
that
he
should
turn
his
back
on
jewdwine
now
on
each
occasion
his
behaviour
had
provoked
the
same
melancholy
admission
from
jewdwine
he
is
magnificent
but
i
ca
afford
him
from
isaac
rickman
i
afford
to
pay
your
price
my
boy
the
incredible
thing
was
that
jewdwine
should
have
been
brought
to
say
it
jewdwine
was
changed
but
rickman
was
the
same
rickman
who
had
swung
the
shop
door
behind
him
unmoved
by
the
separation
from
his
salary
but
after
all
he
could
only
keep
half
of
that
rash
vow
he
had
made
to
himself
on
the
way
to
hampstead
he
must
give
up
the
editor
of
but
he
could
not
give
up
horace
jewdwine
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
been
compelled
to
admit
the
distinction
which
maddox
for
decency
sake
had
insisted
on
when
it
came
to
the
point
as
now
he
found
himself
insisting
on
it
with
even
greater
emphasis
than
maddox
he
knew
that
in
his
soul
jewdwine
still
loved
and
worshipped
what
was
admirable
that
in
his
soul
he
would
have
given
anything
to
recall
his
injustice
to
young
paterson
but
young
paterson
was
too
great
to
have
need
either
of
jewdwine
or
of
him
young
paterson
had
his
genius
to
console
him
his
profounder
pity
was
for
the
man
who
had
inflicted
such
awful
injuries
on
himself
the
great
man
who
had
made
himself
mean
the
spiritual
person
who
had
yielded
to
a
material
tyranny
the
incorruptible
person
who
had
sold
his
soul
who
only
realized
the
value
of
his
soul
now
that
he
had
sold
it
and
yet
he
knew
that
there
could
be
nothing
more
sundering
than
such
meanness
such
corruptibility
as
jewdwine
their
friendship
could
never
be
the
same
there
was
a
certain
relief
in
that
there
could
never
be
any
hypocrisy
any
illusion
in
their
relations
now
and
nobody
knew
that
better
than
jewdwine
well
the
very
fact
that
jewdwine
had
still
desired
and
chosen
that
communion
argued
a
certain
greatness
in
him
therefore
he
resolved
to
spare
him
it
would
cost
him
the
friendship
of
better
men
than
he
but
that
could
not
be
helped
they
must
continue
to
think
that
he
had
sold
or
at
any
rate
lent
himself
at
interest
to
jewdwine
honour
debarred
him
from
all
explanation
and
defence
an
honour
so
private
and
personal
that
it
must
remain
unsuspected
by
the
world
in
the
beginning
he
had
made
himself
almost
unpleasantly
conspicuous
by
the
purity
of
his
literary
morals
his
innocence
had
been
a
spectacle
even
to
honest
journalists
and
now
the
fame
he
would
have
among
them
was
the
fame
of
a
literary
prostitute
without
a
prostitute
wages
on
the
contrary
he
would
have
to
pay
heavily
for
the
spiritual
luxury
of
that
break
with
the
editor
of
when
he
reached
his
comfortable
room
on
the
third
floor
in
torrington
square
he
sat
down
by
his
not
to
write
but
to
think
it
was
fatal
to
letters
such
terrors
arose
before
him
as
must
arise
before
a
young
man
severed
by
his
own
rash
act
from
the
sources
of
his
income
what
a
moment
he
had
chosen
for
the
deed
too
when
money
was
of
all
things
the
thing
he
most
passionately
desired
when
to
his
fancy
the
sum
of
a
hundred
and
pounds
was
the
form
that
most
nearly
most
divinely
presented
the
adored
perfection
when
too
that
enchanting
figure
was
almost
in
his
grasp
a
few
brief
spasms
of
economy
and
ten
months
of
would
have
seen
him
through
and
yet
there
was
no
bitterness
in
the
dismay
with
which
he
contemplated
his
present
forlorn
and
impecunious
state
it
was
inevitable
that
he
should
sever
himself
from
the
sources
of
his
income
when
they
were
found
to
be
impure
much
more
inevitable
than
that
he
should
have
cut
off
that
untainted
supply
which
six
months
ago
would
have
flowed
to
him
through
maddox
common
prudence
had
not
restrained
him
from
quarrelling
with
maddox
over
a
point
of
honour
that
was
shadowy
compared
with
this
it
was
hardly
likely
that
it
should
have
restrained
him
now
there
were
few
things
that
he
would
not
do
for
lucia
harden
but
not
even
for
her
sake
could
he
have
done
otherwise
than
he
had
done
it
was
the
least
that
honour
could
require
of
him
the
very
least
his
attitude
to
honour
had
in
a
manner
changed
eight
years
ago
it
had
seemed
to
him
the
fantastic
child
of
a
preference
for
common
honesty
coupled
with
a
preposterous
passion
for
lucia
harden
he
had
indulged
it
as
a
man
indulges
the
creature
of
fantasy
and
caprice
and
had
felt
that
he
was
thrusting
a
personal
infatuation
into
a
moral
region
where
such
extravagances
are
unknown
it
belonged
rather
to
the
realm
of
imagination
being
essentially
a
poet
honour
a
winged
and
lyric
creature
a
creature
altogether
too
radiant
and
delicate
to
do
battle
with
the
gross
material
world
a
thing
as
mysterious
and
indomitable
as
his
genius
a
very
embarrassing
companion
for
a
young
journalist
in
his
first
start
in
life
and
now
he
had
grown
so
used
to
it
that
it
seemed
to
him
no
longer
mysterious
and
fantastic
obedience
to
it
was
as
simple
as
the
following
of
a
natural
impulse
a
thing
in
no
way
conspicuous
and
superb
it
was
the
men
who
knew
nothing
of
such
leadership
who
seemed
to
him
separated
from
the
order
of
the
world
but
to
the
friends
who
watched
him
rickman
honour
had
been
always
an
amazing
spectacle
like
another
genius
it
had
taken
possession
of
him
and
led
him
through
what
jewdwine
had
called
the
slough
of
journalism
so
that
he
went
with
fine
fastidious
feet
choosing
the
clean
places
in
that
difficult
way
like
another
genius
it
had
lured
him
laughing
and
reckless
along
paths
perilous
and
impossible
to
other
men
how
glad
he
had
been
to
follow
that
impetuous
leader
and
this
was
where
it
had
led
him
to
the
radiant
and
delicate
comrade
of
his
youth
as
he
sat
propping
his
chin
up
with
his
hands
the
face
that
confronted
destiny
had
grown
haggard
in
an
hour
he
pulled
himself
together
and
deliberately
reviewed
the
situation
he
had
at
that
moment
three
and
eightpence
in
his
pocket
and
lying
about
somewhere
in
the
there
was
part
of
last
salary
and
a
cheque
for
nine
pounds
the
price
of
a
recent
article
he
could
count
on
five
pounds
at
michaelmas
the
quarterly
rent
of
the
furniture
in
the
little
house
at
ealing
added
to
these
certain
sums
there
was
that
unknown
incalculable
amount
that
he
might
yet
receive
for
unsolicited
contributions
he
had
made
pounds
in
this
way
last
year
the
casual
earnings
of
were
no
security
for
nineteen
hundred
still
invincible
hopefulness
fixed
the
probabilities
at
that
figure
but
it
was
now
january
and
dicky
pilkington
bill
would
be
due
in
november
by
successive
triumphs
of
ingenious
economy
he
had
reduced
that
once
appalling
seven
hundred
and
fifty
to
a
hundred
and
he
could
actually
count
on
more
than
pounds
three
and
eightpence
with
which
to
meet
the
liability
and
he
had
also
to
live
for
ten
months
before
he
met
it
even
invincible
hope
was
nervous
facing
those
formidable
figures
it
did
indeed
suggest
the
presence
of
a
shadowy
army
in
the
rear
whole
columns
of
figures
marching
invincibly
to
his
aid
they
were
the
sums
that
might
that
ought
to
be
obtained
by
a
dramatic
poet
in
the
hour
of
his
success
but
rickman
had
not
been
born
over
a
bookseller
shop
for
nothing
and
an
austere
hereditary
voice
reminded
him
that
he
could
really
count
on
a
penny
from
his
tragedy
he
could
even
afford
to
write
it
the
thing
was
economically
speaking
a
crime
it
would
of
course
be
finished
as
it
had
been
begun
in
defiance
of
economy
as
of
all
other
human
pieties
and
laws
but
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
expect
that
any
financial
blessing
could
rest
on
it
he
had
only
got
ten
months
to
raise
the
money
in
it
would
probably
take
him
that
time
to
find
regular
work
if
he
found
it
there
was
not
an
editor
in
london
to
whom
the
initials
conveyed
the
unique
significance
they
did
to
jewdwine
to
maddox
and
to
rankin
he
now
thought
with
regret
of
the
introductions
he
had
refused
in
the
insolence
of
his
youth
to
hanson
for
instance
hanson
was
a
good
sort
and
he
might
have
come
in
very
handy
now
a
few
other
names
passed
before
him
men
whom
it
would
be
useless
for
him
to
approach
there
was
old
mackinnon
though
who
was
a
good
sort
too
he
had
long
ago
forgotten
that
ancient
jest
which
compared
his
head
with
the
dome
of
the
museum
he
had
been
the
most
frequent
entertainer
of
adventitious
prose
mackinnon
might
be
good
for
something
he
had
half
a
mind
to
look
him
up
the
thought
of
mackinnon
made
him
feel
almost
cheerful
again
before
he
went
to
bed
he
put
ten
pounds
into
a
on
an
inaccessible
shelf
keeping
one
pound
three
and
eightpence
for
the
expenses
of
the
coming
week
the
next
morning
he
looked
mackinnon
up
now
mackinnon
head
was
so
far
unlike
the
dome
of
the
museum
that
it
was
by
no
means
impervious
to
light
and
where
mackinnon
interests
were
concerned
it
was
positively
limpid
in
its
transparency
so
that
mackinnon
was
not
slow
to
perceive
the
advantages
of
an
alliance
with
impecunious
brilliance
the
brilliance
he
was
already
familiar
with
the
impecuniosity
he
inferred
from
the
more
than
usual
offhandedness
of
rickman
manner
the
war
had
hit
mackinnon
also
the
affairs
of
the
were
not
so
flourishing
as
mackinnon
could
have
wished
and
he
was
meditating
some
reductions
in
his
staff
he
reflected
that
young
men
in
rickman
mood
and
rickman
circumstances
were
sometimes
willing
to
do
the
work
of
two
journalists
for
a
lower
salary
than
he
had
been
paying
to
one
and
when
he
further
learnt
that
rickman
had
left
he
felt
that
besides
these
solid
advantages
a
subtler
satisfaction
would
be
his
jewdwine
corruptible
or
incorruptible
had
not
endeared
himself
to
other
editors
and
even
the
sober
mackinnon
was
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
of
annexing
the
great
man
great
man
but
the
head
impenetrable
in
this
betrayed
none
of
the
thoughts
that
were
going
on
inside
it
and
in
the
bargaining
that
followed
it
was
concealed
from
rickman
that
his
connection
with
had
in
any
way
increased
his
market
value
he
made
the
best
terms
he
could
and
the
end
of
the
interview
found
him
retained
on
mackinnon
staff
as
leader
writer
and
dramatic
critic
at
a
salary
of
two
pounds
ten
a
week
mackinnon
had
offered
two
pounds
rickman
had
held
out
for
three
and
they
split
the
difference
as
the
poet
left
the
room
mackinnon
turned
to
his
desk
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
that
seemed
to
illuminate
the
dome
he
had
effected
a
considerable
saving
by
that
little
transaction
and
for
the
poet
it
did
not
prove
so
bad
a
bargain
after
all
he
had
now
a
more
ample
leisure
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
journalistic
career
he
knew
what
it
was
to
be
left
mercifully
beneficently
alone
he
had
cut
himself
off
from
all
his
friends
and
though
at
times
his
heart
suffered
his
genius
profited
by
the
isolation
it
was
not
until
he
had
escaped
from
jewdwine
that
he
realized
what
that
special
deliverance
meant
for
him
he
could
not
well
have
encountered
a
more
subtle
and
dangerous
influence
than
that
of
the
author
of
the
to
jewdwine
had
been
hostile
to
his
genius
from
the
beginning
though
he
had
cared
for
it
too
in
his
imperious
way
he
would
have
tamed
the
young
ungovernably
ardent
thing
and
wedded
it
to
his
own
beautiful
and
passionless
idea
an
achievement
which
would
have
reflected
some
glory
on
jewdwine
as
the
matchmaker
but
he
had
left
off
caring
when
he
found
that
he
had
less
to
gain
from
rickman
genius
than
from
his
talent
and
had
turned
his
attention
to
the
protection
and
encouragement
of
the
more
profitable
power
as
that
talent
ran
riot
in
the
columns
of
rickman
himself
was
unaware
how
relentlessly
it
drew
on
the
vitality
that
sustained
his
genius
it
was
jewdwine
excuse
that
the
vitality
seemed
inexhaustible
jewdwine
as
he
had
once
said
dreaded
the
divine
fire
he
would
ultimately
have
subdued
the
flame
by
a
persistent
demand
for
brilliance
of
another
kind
even
maddox
who
adored
his
rickman
had
not
seen
that
his
rickman
his
young
divinity
must
change
and
grow
he
admired
his
immortal
adolescence
he
would
have
him
young
and
lyrical
for
ever
he
had
discovered
everything
in
him
but
the
dramatic
poet
he
was
yet
to
be
thus
through
the
very
fervour
of
his
superstition
maddox
had
proved
hostile
too
but
in
mackinnon
rickman
found
no
malign
disturbing
influence
no
influence
of
any
kind
at
all
no
thought
of
capturing
his
genius
or
exploiting
his
talent
had
ever
entered
into
the
head
mackinnon
his
mortal
nature
appeased
by
his
victory
over
jewdwine
and
further
gratified
by
the
consciousness
of
having
secured
a
good
man
cheap
made
no
exorbitant
claims
on
his
contributor
let
rickman
write
what
he
would
mackinnon
knew
he
had
got
his
money
worth
rickman
squared
himself
nobly
for
the
next
round
with
fortune
and
dicky
in
his
attitude
of
enthusiastic
but
not
uninterested
spectator
cheered
him
on
secretly
exultant
dicky
was
now
serenely
sure
of
his
odds
it
was
and
rickman
could
not
hold
out
long
after
such
an
injury
to
his
income
but
rickman
unconquered
made
matters
even
by
reducing
his
expenditure
it
was
winter
and
the
severity
of
the
weather
would
have
ruined
him
in
coal
alone
had
he
not
abandoned
the
superstition
of
a
fire
with
an
there
was
always
some
slight
danger
of
asphyxia
but
rickman
loved
the
piquancy
of
danger
by
many
such
ingenious
substitutions
he
effected
so
prodigious
a
saving
that
or
more
of
his
salary
went
into
the
and
thence
into
dicky
pilkington
pocket
he
rejoiced
to
see
it
go
so
completely
had
he
subdued
the
lust
of
spending
so
ardently
embraced
the
life
of
poverty
if
it
were
poverty
to
live
on
a
pound
a
week
was
it
not
rather
wanton
iniquitous
extravagance
to
have
allowed
himself
three
times
that
amount
but
for
that
his
position
at
this
moment
would
have
been
such
that
three
months
on
the
would
have
cleared
him
as
he
stood
the
remainder
of
his
debt
loomed
monstrous
under
the
shadow
of
next
november
and
it
was
this
moment
when
he
should
have
been
turning
his
talent
into
by
unremitting
journalism
that
he
chose
for
finishing
his
tragedy
if
he
could
be
said
to
have
chosen
it
for
it
was
rather
the
tragic
muse
that
had
claimed
him
for
her
own
she
knew
her
hour
the
first
young
hour
of
his
deliverance
when
he
had
ceased
from
hungering
and
thirsting
after
life
and
from
the
violence
and
stress
of
living
and
was
no
more
tormented
by
scruple
and
by
passion
when
the
flaming
orgy
of
his
individuality
no
longer
confused
the
pageant
of
the
world
he
had
been
judging
by
himself
when
he
propounded
the
startling
theory
that
lyric
poets
must
grow
into
dramatic
poets
if
they
grow
at
all
it
was
now
when
his
youth
no
longer
sang
aloud
in
him
that
he
heard
the
living
voices
of
the
men
and
women
whom
he
made
their
flesh
and
blood
no
longer
struggled
violently
for
birth
no
longer
tortured
the
delicate
tissue
of
the
dream
his
dreams
themselves
were
brought
forth
incarnate
he
being
no
longer
at
variance
with
himself
as
in
the
days
of
drama
and
so
now
when
he
contemplated
his
poverty
he
saw
in
it
the
head
and
austere
countenance
of
an
archangel
destiny
in
the
absence
of
all
visible
and
material
comfort
the
invisible
powers
assumed
their
magnificent
dominion
he
gave
his
evenings
to
mackinnon
and
his
mornings
his
fresh
divine
mornings
to
the
tragic
muse
thus
setting
a
blessed
purifying
interval
of
sleep
between
his
talent
and
his
genius
but
through
it
all
while
he
slept
and
while
he
worked
and
while
he
scribbled
with
a
tenth
part
of
his
brain
mechanically
filling
in
his
columns
of
the
he
felt
that
his
genius
conscious
of
its
hour
possessed
him
utterly
not
even
for
lucia
sake
could
he
resist
the
god
who
was
so
tyrannous
and
strong
in
his
heart
he
called
on
her
to
forgive
him
for
writing
unsaleable
tragedies
when
he
ought
to
have
been
making
money
for
her
his
heart
kept
on
accusing
him
you
would
write
tragedies
if
she
were
starving
it
said
and
the
god
indignant
at
the
interruption
answered
it
you
would
you
fool
you
know
you
would
and
she
is
starving
it
you
who
starve
if
anybody
does
so
fire
away
and
he
fired
away
for
hope
still
invincible
told
him
that
he
could
afford
to
do
it
that
he
had
in
a
drawer
fifty
pounds
worth
of
unpublished
articles
works
of
the
baser
power
and
that
war
or
no
war
he
could
surely
sell
them
he
could
sell
his
furniture
also
and
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
he
could
sell
his
books
his
own
books
not
lucia
meanwhile
he
must
get
on
with
his
tragedy
he
could
easily
finish
it
in
six
weeks
and
expiate
the
crime
by
months
of
journalism
he
did
finish
it
in
six
weeks
and
when
the
spring
came
he
began
another
for
the
hand
of
the
god
was
heavy
upon
him
this
he
knew
was
madness
though
a
madness
divine
and
irresistible
in
view
of
its
continuance
he
called
upon
mackinnon
and
inquired
whether
at
any
time
if
the
occasion
should
arise
he
could
count
upon
an
advance
of
salary
mackinnon
solid
impenetrable
but
benignant
replied
that
very
possibly
it
might
be
so
this
rickman
interpreted
as
a
distinct
encouragement
to
dally
with
the
tragic
muse
it
was
followed
by
a
request
from
mackinnon
that
rickman
on
his
part
should
oblige
him
with
a
few
columns
in
advance
this
he
did
he
was
now
though
he
was
blissfully
unaware
of
it
the
last
man
on
the
paper
in
six
months
from
the
time
of
his
joining
its
staff
the
ceased
from
observing
and
mackinnon
retired
suddenly
into
private
life
dicky
who
had
watched
with
joy
the
decline
of
the
chuckled
openly
at
its
fall
he
was
sorry
for
old
razors
though
it
was
hard
luck
on
him
old
razors
in
dicky
opinion
was
about
done
for
now
it
might
have
seemed
so
to
rickman
but
that
the
experience
had
sobered
him
he
rose
from
the
embraces
of
the
tragic
muse
yet
dizzy
with
the
august
rapture
he
resisted
and
defied
the
god
he
thrust
his
tragedy
from
him
into
the
hindmost
obscurity
of
his
then
he
betook
himself
in
a
mood
more
imperative
than
solicitous
to
hanson
hanson
who
had
labelled
him
decadent
and
lumped
him
with
letheby
it
was
no
matter
now
whatever
hanson
thought
of
his
genius
there
could
be
but
one
opinion
of
his
talent
hanson
was
genial
and
complimentary
he
like
mackinnon
knew
his
business
too
well
to
let
savage
keith
rickman
slip
through
his
fingers
like
mackinnon
he
was
pleased
with
the
idea
of
securing
a
deserter
from
the
insufferable
jewdwine
but
the
was
full
up
with
war
news
and
entirely
contented
with
its
staff
hanson
was
only
good
for
occasional
contributions
rickman
again
overhauled
his
complicated
accounts
by
what
seemed
to
him
a
series
of
miracles
he
had
saved
pounds
somehow
during
those
six
months
with
mackinnon
but
how
he
was
going
to
raise
a
hundred
in
four
months
he
did
not
know
that
was
what
he
meant
to
try
for
though
it
was
july
and
he
loved
more
than
ever
the
green
peace
of
torrington
square
and
the
room
associated
with
the
first
austere
delights
of
poverty
and
the
presence
of
the
tragic
muse
but
he
could
forego
even
peace
for
four
months
after
much
search
in
the
secret
places
of
bloomsbury
he
found
an
empty
attic
in
howland
street
the
house
was
clean
decent
and
quiet
for
a
wonder
thither
he
removed
himself
and
his
belongings
he
had
parted
with
all
but
the
absolutely
essential
among
which
he
reckoned
all
lucia
books
and
a
few
of
his
own
he
had
stripped
himself
for
this
last
round
with
fortune
he
would
come
out
of
it
all
right
if
he
wrote
nothing
but
articles
lived
on
ten
shillings
a
week
and
sold
the
articles
which
meant
that
in
the
weeks
when
no
articles
were
sold
he
must
live
on
less
it
meant
too
that
he
must
make
his
own
bed
sweep
his
own
room
and
cook
his
own
meals
when
they
were
cooked
at
all
that
to
have
clean
linen
he
must
pay
the
price
of
many
meals
as
he
counted
meals
the
attic
was
not
a
nice
place
in
july
and
august
though
the
house
was
quiet
there
flowed
through
it
in
an
incessant
suffocating
sickly
stream
the
untamed
smells
and
noises
of
the
street
for
the
sake
of
peace
he
took
to
working
through
the
night
and
going
to
bed
in
the
an
eccentricity
which
caused
him
to
be
regarded
with
some
suspicion
by
his
neighbours
in
spite
of
their
apparent
decency
he
had
judged
it
expedient
to
keep
his
door
locked
a
lack
of
confidence
that
wounded
them
the
lodger
in
the
garret
next
to
his
went
so
far
as
to
signify
by
laughter
her
opinion
of
his
unfriendly
secrecy
her
own
door
was
never
shut
except
when
he
shut
it
this
interference
with
her
liberty
she
once
violently
resented
delivering
herself
of
a
jet
of
oratory
that
bore
with
fancy
on
his
parentage
and
profession
for
her
threshold
was
her
vantage
ground
upon
it
she
stood
and
waited
listening
for
the
footsteps
of
her
luck
it
was
a
marvel
to
him
how
under
these
conditions
he
could
turn
out
the
amount
of
work
he
did
for
some
nights
were
as
noisy
as
the
day
there
was
no
sort
of
repose
about
his
neighbour
at
times
she
coughed
all
night
at
times
she
sang
or
again
by
sounds
of
sobbing
he
gathered
that
the
poor
wretch
was
not
prospering
in
her
trade
still
there
were
long
and
blessed
intervals
of
peace
when
she
roamed
farther
afield
intervals
which
might
or
might
not
be
prolonged
by
alcoholic
stupor
after
her
return
it
may
have
been
owing
to
these
influences
that
he
began
to
notice
a
decided
deterioration
in
his
prose
hanson
had
returned
his
last
article
he
had
worked
poor
hanson
geniality
for
all
it
was
worth
and
he
felt
that
in
common
prudence
he
must
withdraw
from
the
for
a
season
meanwhile
his
best
prose
the
articles
he
had
by
him
remained
unpublished
in
there
was
no
market
for
such
wares
it
was
now
october
and
he
had
paid
off
but
fifteen
pounds
of
the
hundred
he
still
owed
the
lease
of
the
little
house
at
ealing
was
out
at
michaelmas
he
had
the
five
pounds
provided
every
quarter
by
the
furniture
he
sold
his
furniture
and
the
last
of
his
books
but
when
dicky
bill
fell
due
in
november
he
was
still
fifty
pounds
to
the
bad
the
fact
that
he
had
already
paid
three
thousand
and
would
not
prevent
the
sale
and
dispersal
of
part
and
perhaps
the
most
valuable
part
of
the
harden
library
in
that
event
he
would
get
the
money
not
the
books
and
it
was
the
books
all
the
books
he
wanted
he
had
persuaded
himself
that
the
actual
redemption
of
the
whole
was
the
only
legitimate
means
by
which
he
could
now
approach
lucia
harden
the
mere
repayment
of
the
money
was
a
coarser
and
more
difficult
method
and
now
at
the
last
moment
the
end
all
but
achieved
was
as
far
from
him
as
ever
supposing
dicky
should
refuse
to
renew
his
bill
but
dicky
did
not
refuse
he
gave
him
another
two
months
no
longer
term
could
be
conceded
but
yes
he
would
give
him
another
two
months
just
for
the
almighty
fun
of
the
thing
if
there
one
thing
i
like
to
see
said
dicky
it
pluck
dicky
was
more
than
ever
sure
of
his
game
he
argued
rightly
that
rickman
would
never
have
sold
his
books
if
he
could
have
sold
his
articles
or
borrowed
from
a
friend
that
as
he
had
nothing
else
to
sell
or
offer
as
security
his
end
was
certain
but
it
was
so
glorious
to
see
the
little
fellow
fighting
his
luck
dicky
was
willing
to
prolong
the
excitement
for
another
two
months
for
two
months
he
fought
it
furiously
he
spent
many
hours
of
many
days
in
trying
to
find
work
a
difficult
thing
when
a
man
has
cut
himself
loose
from
all
his
friends
strangers
were
not
likely
to
consider
his
superior
claims
when
the
kind
of
work
for
which
he
was
now
applying
could
be
done
by
anybody
as
well
or
better
he
counted
himself
uncommonly
happy
if
he
got
a
stray
book
to
review
or
a
job
at
the
museum
or
if
vaughan
held
out
the
promise
of
giving
him
some
translation
the
conditions
under
which
he
worked
were
now
appalling
it
was
hard
to
say
whether
the
attic
was
more
terrible
in
summer
or
in
the
winter
that
forced
him
to
the
intimate
and
abominable
companionship
of
his
nor
was
that
all
a
new
horror
was
added
to
his
existence
he
was
aware
that
he
had
become
an
object
of
peculiar
interest
to
the
woman
in
the
next
room
that
she
waited
for
him
and
stealthily
watched
his
going
out
and
his
coming
in
as
he
passed
on
the
landing
two
eyes
dull
or
feverish
marked
him
through
the
chink
of
the
door
that
never
closed
by
some
hideous
instinct
of
her
kind
she
divined
the
days
when
he
was
in
luck
by
another
instinct
she
divined
also
his
nature
his
mystic
apathy
held
her
brute
soul
in
awe
and
she
no
longer
revenged
herself
by
furious
and
vindictive
song
so
he
stayed
on
for
he
owed
rent
and
removals
were
expensive
he
found
also
that
there
were
limits
to
the
advantages
of
too
eccentric
an
asceticism
in
diet
no
doubt
the
strange
meals
he
prepared
for
himself
on
his
had
proved
stimulating
by
their
very
strangeness
but
when
the
first
shock
and
surprise
of
them
had
worn
off
he
no
longer
obtained
that
agreeable
result
perhaps
there
was
something
cloying
in
so
much
milk
and
cocoa
he
fancied
he
gained
by
diluting
these
rich
foods
with
water
it
certainly
seemed
to
him
that
his
veins
were
lighter
and
carried
a
swifter
and
more
delicate
current
to
his
brain
that
his
thoughts
now
flowed
with
a
remarkable
fineness
and
lucidity
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
charm
stopped
working
what
food
he
ate
ceased
to
nourish
him
he
grew
drowsy
by
day
and
had
bad
dreams
at
night
he
had
not
yet
reached
the
reconciling
stage
of
nausea
but
was
forever
tormented
by
a
strong
and
healthy
craving
for
a
square
meal
there
was
a
poor
devil
on
the
floor
below
him
whose
state
in
comparison
with
his
own
was
affluence
that
man
had
a
square
meal
every
sunday
even
she
the
lady
of
the
door
was
better
off
than
he
there
was
always
or
nearly
always
a
market
for
her
wares
his
sufferings
would
have
been
unendurable
if
any
will
but
his
own
had
imposed
them
on
him
in
the
beginning
not
that
he
could
continue
to
regard
his
poverty
as
a
destiny
in
any
way
angelic
it
was
because
hitherto
he
had
not
known
the
real
thing
because
he
had
seen
it
from
very
far
away
that
it
had
worn
for
him
that
divine
benignant
aspect
now
it
was
very
near
him
a
sordid
insufferable
companion
that
dogged
his
elbow
in
the
street
that
sat
with
him
by
his
fireless
hearth
that
lay
beside
him
all
night
a
loathsome
bedfellow
telling
him
a
shameful
hopeless
tale
and
driving
the
blessed
sleep
away
from
him
there
were
times
when
he
envied
his
neighbour
her
nirvana
of
gin
and
water
times
when
the
gross
steam
of
the
stew
prepared
for
the
man
below
awoke
in
him
acute
intolerable
emotion
times
when
the
spiritual
will
that
dominated
him
so
far
from
being
purified
by
abstinence
seemed
merged
in
the
will
of
the
body
made
conspicuous
and
clamorous
by
hunger
there
were
ways
in
which
he
might
have
satisfied
it
he
could
have
obtained
a
square
meal
any
day
from
downey
or
the
spinkses
but
now
that
the
value
of
a
square
meal
had
increased
so
monstrously
in
imagination
his
delicacy
shrank
from
approaching
his
friends
with
conscious
designs
upon
their
hospitality
spinks
was
always
asking
him
to
dine
at
his
house
in
camden
town
but
he
had
refused
because
he
would
have
had
abominable
suspicions
of
his
own
motives
in
accepting
trust
flossie
to
find
him
out
too
and
latterly
he
had
hidden
himself
from
the
eye
of
spinks
there
were
moments
now
when
he
might
have
been
tempted
to
borrow
fifty
pounds
from
spinks
and
end
it
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
borrow
from
flossie
husband
the
last
time
he
had
dined
with
them
he
thought
she
had
looked
at
him
as
if
she
were
afraid
he
was
going
to
borrow
money
he
knew
it
so
well
that
gleam
of
the
black
eyes
half
subtle
and
half
savage
for
flossie
had
realized
her
dream
and
her
little
hand
clung
passionately
to
the
purse
that
provided
for
muriel
maud
he
could
borrow
from
spinky
from
jewdwine
never
from
hanson
hardly
from
vaughan
possibly
vaughan
was
considering
the
expediency
of
publishing
his
tragedy
and
might
be
induced
to
advance
him
a
little
on
account
such
possibilities
visited
him
in
the
watches
of
the
night
but
dawn
revealed
their
obvious
futility
and
yet
he
knew
all
the
time
he
had
only
to
go
to
maddox
for
the
money
and
he
would
get
it
to
maddox
or
to
rankin
rankin
whose
books
stood
open
on
every
bookstall
whose
face
in
its
beautiful
photogravure
portrait
smiled
so
impenetrably
guarding
the
secret
of
success
but
he
could
not
go
to
them
without
giving
them
the
explanation
he
was
determined
not
to
give
he
knew
what
they
thought
of
him
therefore
he
would
not
go
to
them
if
they
had
known
him
better
they
would
have
come
to
him
he
was
reminded
of
them
now
by
seeing
in
an
obituary
notice
of
young
paterson
paterson
had
been
dying
slowly
all
the
year
and
december
finished
him
though
rickman
had
been
expecting
the
news
for
months
the
death
accomplished
affected
him
profoundly
and
at
the
thought
of
the
young
poet
whom
he
had
seemed
to
have
so
greatly
wronged
at
the
touch
of
grief
and
pity
and
divine
regret
his
own
genius
defied
and
resisted
descended
on
him
again
out
of
heaven
it
was
as
if
the
spirit
of
young
paterson
appeased
and
reconciled
had
bequeathed
to
him
its
own
immortal
adolescence
he
finished
the
poem
in
four
nights
sitting
in
his
great
coat
with
his
legs
wrapped
in
his
blankets
and
for
the
last
two
nights
drinking
gin
and
water
to
keep
the
blood
beating
in
his
head
in
the
morning
he
felt
as
if
it
were
filled
with
some
light
and
crackling
and
infinitely
brittle
substance
the
ashes
of
a
brain
that
had
kindled
flamed
and
burned
itself
away
it
was
the
last
onslaught
of
the
god
the
last
mad
flaring
of
the
divine
fire
for
now
he
could
write
no
longer
his
whole
being
revolted
against
the
labour
of
capturing
ideas
of
setting
words
in
their
right
order
the
least
effort
produced
some
horrible
sensation
now
it
was
of
a
plunging
heart
that
suddenly
reversed
engines
while
his
brain
shivered
with
the
shock
now
of
a
little
white
wave
that
swamped
his
brain
with
one
pulse
of
oblivion
now
it
was
a
sudden
giving
way
of
the
floor
of
consciousness
through
which
his
thoughts
dropped
downwards
headlong
into
the
abyss
he
had
great
agony
and
distress
in
following
their
flight
at
night
as
he
lay
in
bed
watching
the
feeble
automatic
procession
of
ideas
he
noticed
that
they
arrived
in
an
order
that
was
not
the
order
of
sanity
that
if
he
took
note
of
the
language
they
clothed
themselves
in
he
found
he
was
listening
as
it
were
to
the
gabble
of
idiocy
or
aphasia
at
such
moments
he
trembled
for
his
reason
at
first
these
horrors
would
vanish
in
the
brief
brilliance
that
followed
the
act
of
eating
but
before
long
in
the
next
stage
of
exhaustion
food
induced
nothing
but
a
drunken
drowsiness
he
had
once
said
as
an
excuse
for
refusing
wine
that
he
could
get
drunk
on
anything
else
as
well
in
these
days
he
got
dead
drunk
on
oatmeal
porridge
while
he
produced
a
perishing
ecstasy
on
bread
and
milk
but
of
genuine
intoxication
the
pennyworth
of
gin
and
water
that
sustained
the
immortal
elegy
was
his
last
excess
he
sent
the
poem
to
hanson
hanson
made
no
sign
but
about
the
middle
of
january
rankin
of
all
people
broke
the
silence
that
had
bound
them
for
a
year
and
a
half
rankin
did
not
know
his
address
even
hanson
had
forgotten
it
the
letter
had
been
forwarded
by
one
of
clerks
my
dear
rickman
it
said
where
are
you
and
what
are
you
doing
i
dined
with
hanson
the
other
night
and
he
showed
me
your
elegy
it
too
long
for
and
he
sending
it
back
to
you
with
a
string
of
compliments
if
you
have
no
other
designs
can
you
let
us
have
it
for
for
sake
it
ought
to
appear
at
once
my
dear
fellow
i
should
like
to
tell
you
what
i
think
of
it
but
i
will
only
state
my
profound
conviction
that
you
have
given
poor
paterson
the
fame
he
should
have
had
and
could
get
anymore
than
we
could
get
it
for
him
and
i
as
his
friend
thank
you
for
this
magnificent
tribute
to
his
genius
will
you
do
me
the
honour
of
dining
with
me
on
sunday
if
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
there
are
many
things
i
should
like
to
talk
over
with
you
and
my
wife
is
anxious
to
make
your
acquaintance
sincerely
yours
herbert
rankin
maddox
is
out
of
town
at
present
but
you
meet
him
if
you
come
on
sunday
by
the
way
i
saw
your
friend
jewdwine
the
other
day
he
explained
at
my
request
a
certain
matter
which
i
own
with
great
regret
should
never
have
required
explanation
so
jewdwine
had
explained
and
why
had
not
rankin
asked
for
the
explanation
sooner
why
had
he
had
to
ask
for
it
at
all
still
it
was
decent
of
him
to
admit
that
he
ought
not
to
have
required
it
he
supposed
that
he
must
accept
rankin
invitation
to
dine
except
for
his
hunger
which
made
the
prospect
of
dining
so
unique
and
great
a
thing
he
had
no
reason
for
refusing
rankin
had
reckoned
on
a
scruple
and
removed
the
ground
of
it
he
knew
that
there
was
no
approaching
rickman
as
long
as
there
remained
the
shadow
of
an
assumption
that
the
explanation
should
have
come
from
him
the
invitation
had
arrived
just
in
time
before
rickman
had
sent
the
last
saleable
remnants
of
his
wardrobe
to
the
place
where
his
had
gone
before
he
would
have
to
apologize
to
rankin
for
its
absence
but
his
serge
suit
was
still
presentable
for
he
had
preserved
it
with
much
care
and
there
was
one
clean
unfrayed
shirt
in
his
drawer
but
when
sunday
came
the
first
febrile
excitement
of
anticipation
was
succeeded
by
the
apathy
of
an
immense
fatigue
and
at
the
back
of
it
all
a
loathsome
sense
of
the
positive
indecency
of
his
going
it
was
hunger
that
was
driving
him
the
importunate
hunger
of
many
months
apparent
in
his
lean
face
and
shrunken
figure
and
after
all
could
any
dinner
be
worth
the
pain
of
dressing
for
it
when
at
the
last
moment
he
discovered
a
loose
button
on
his
trousers
he
felt
that
there
was
no
motive
no
power
on
earth
that
could
urge
him
to
the
task
of
securing
it
and
when
it
broke
from
its
thread
and
fell
and
hid
itself
under
the
skirting
board
in
a
sort
of
malignant
frenzy
he
took
its
behaviour
as
a
sign
that
he
would
do
well
to
forego
that
dinner
at
rankin
he
had
hardly
acquiesced
in
this
decision
when
reason
reasserted
itself
and
told
him
that
everything
depended
on
that
dinner
and
that
the
dinner
depended
on
the
button
therefore
that
in
all
god
universe
there
was
nothing
so
important
so
essential
to
him
as
that
button
he
went
down
on
his
knees
and
dislodged
the
button
with
a
penknife
after
an
agonizing
search
he
sat
feebly
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
and
with
many
sad
weak
blasphemies
bowed
himself
to
a
miserable
ignominious
struggle
all
malign
and
adverse
fortunes
seemed
to
be
concentrated
in
the
rolling
slippery
ungovernable
thing
the
final
victory
was
his
such
a
victory
as
amounted
to
a
resurgence
of
the
spiritual
will
chapter
lxx
all
things
seemed
to
work
together
to
create
an
evening
of
misunderstanding
rather
than
of
reconciliation
to
begin
with
he
arrived
at
the
rankins
half
an
hour
after
the
time
appointed
rankin
lived
in
sussex
square
which
seemed
to
him
an
interminably
long
way
off
the
adventure
with
the
trouser
button
and
a
certain
dizziness
which
precluded
all
swift
and
decided
movement
would
have
been
enough
to
make
him
late
even
if
he
had
not
miscalculated
the
distance
between
hyde
park
and
bloomsbury
he
had
also
miscalculated
the
distance
between
rankin
the
junior
journalist
and
rankin
the
celebrity
rankin
had
achieved
celebrity
in
a
way
he
had
not
meant
there
was
a
time
when
even
jewdwine
was
outdone
by
the
young
men
of
in
honest
contempt
for
the
taste
and
judgement
of
the
many
when
it
had
been
rankin
task
to
pursue
with
indefatigable
pleasantry
the
figures
of
popular
renown
and
now
he
was
popular
himself
the
british
public
had
given
to
him
its
fatal
love
at
first
he
looked
on
himself
as
a
man
irretrievably
disgraced
however
proudly
he
might
bear
himself
in
the
company
of
strangers
he
approached
his
colleagues
with
the
air
of
a
man
made
absurd
by
unsolicited
attentions
persecuted
and
compromised
to
the
last
degree
the
bosses
of
his
ruddy
face
displayed
all
the
quiverings
and
tortures
and
suffusions
of
a
smiling
shame
he
was
however
compensated
for
the
loss
of
personal
dignity
by
a
very
substantial
income
not
that
at
first
he
would
admit
the
compensation
ricky
he
would
say
in
the
voice
of
a
man
bowed
and
broken
on
the
wheel
of
life
you
envy
me
my
thousands
they
are
the
measure
of
my
abasement
yet
he
continued
to
abase
himself
nothing
was
more
amazing
than
his
versatility
the
public
could
hardly
keep
up
with
the
flight
of
rankin
incarnations
comedy
pathetic
pastoral
fantastic
adventure
slum
idyll
and
medieval
romance
it
was
all
one
to
rankin
an
infallible
instinct
told
him
which
should
be
chosen
at
any
given
moment
a
secret
tocsin
sounded
the
hour
of
his
success
and
still
the
spirit
of
rankin
held
itself
aloof
and
underneath
his
many
disguises
he
remained
a
junior
journalist
but
latterly
since
his
marriage
with
a
rich
city
merchant
daughter
an
insidious
seriousness
had
overtaken
him
he
began
first
to
tolerate
then
to
respect
then
to
revere
the
sources
of
his
affluence
the
old
ironic
spirit
was
there
to
chastise
him
whenever
he
caught
himself
doing
it
but
that
spirit
made
discord
with
the
elegant
respectability
which
was
now
the
atmosphere
of
his
home
rankin
where
he
was
now
waiting
for
rickman
was
furnished
with
the
utmost
correctness
in
the
purest
chippendale
upholstered
in
silver
and
grey
and
lemon
and
rose
brocade
it
had
grey
curtains
with
a
design
of
true
lovers
knots
in
silver
straight
draperies
of
delicate
immaculate
white
muslin
veiled
the
for
the
feet
an
interminable
stretch
of
grey
velvet
carpet
whose
pattern
lay
on
it
like
a
soft
shadow
globes
of
electric
light
drooped
clustering
under
voluminously
fluted
shades
rankin
himself
looked
grossly
out
of
keeping
with
the
scene
it
was
and
they
both
knew
it
simply
the
correct
setting
for
his
wife
who
dominated
it
a
young
splendour
of
and
and
jewelled
laces
and
gold
rickman
after
many
weeks
imprisonment
between
four
dirty
yellow
ochre
walls
was
bewildered
with
the
space
the
colours
the
perfumes
the
illumination
he
was
suffering
from
a
curious
and
it
seemed
to
him
insane
illusion
the
illusion
of
distance
the
magnifying
of
the
spaces
he
had
got
to
traverse
and
as
he
entered
the
way
from
the
threshold
to
the
hearthrug
stretched
before
him
as
interminably
as
the
way
from
howland
street
to
sussex
square
but
of
any
other
distance
he
was
blissfully
unaware
beside
his
vision
of
lucia
harden
herbert
rankin
was
an
entirely
insignificant
person
now
rankin
was
a
little
afraid
of
the
elegant
lady
his
wife
he
had
had
to
apologise
to
her
many
times
for
the
curious
people
he
brought
to
the
house
and
he
was
anxious
that
rickman
should
make
a
good
impression
he
was
also
hungry
as
hungry
as
a
man
can
be
who
has
three
square
meals
every
day
of
his
life
therefore
he
was
annoyed
with
rickman
for
being
late
but
his
annoyance
vanished
at
the
first
sight
of
him
his
handshake
was
significant
of
atonement
and
immutable
affection
he
introduced
him
almost
fearlessly
to
his
wife
he
had
been
at
some
pains
to
impress
upon
her
that
she
was
about
to
entertain
a
much
greater
man
than
her
husband
and
that
it
would
be
very
charming
of
her
if
she
behaved
accordingly
at
this
she
pouted
prettily
as
became
a
bride
and
he
pointed
out
that
as
keith
rickman
was
a
poet
his
greatness
was
incommensurable
with
that
of
her
husband
it
left
him
undisturbed
upon
his
eminence
as
the
supreme
master
of
prose
so
that
rankin
smiled
dimly
and
deferentially
as
an
elegant
hostess
must
smile
upon
a
poet
who
has
kept
her
waiting
there
were
two
other
ladies
there
rankin
mother
and
sister
from
the
provinces
their
greeting
conveyed
a
rustling
and
excited
consciousness
of
the
distinction
as
rankin
family
retreated
maddox
heaved
himself
forward
and
grasped
rickman
hand
without
a
word
rickman
had
no
very
clear
idea
of
what
happened
in
the
brief
pause
before
dinner
his
first
sensation
was
one
of
confused
beatitude
and
warmth
of
being
received
into
an
enfolding
atmosphere
of
friendliness
he
was
sure
it
was
friendliness
that
made
maddox
pluck
him
by
the
arm
and
draw
him
down
beside
him
on
the
sofa
and
he
was
too
tired
to
wonder
why
maddy
should
think
it
necessary
to
whisper
into
his
collar
steady
you
be
all
right
if
you
sit
still
old
man
the
strange
voices
of
the
women
confused
him
further
and
standing
made
him
giddy
he
was
glad
to
sit
still
in
his
corner
obliterated
by
maddy
colossal
shoulders
it
was
friendliness
he
knew
that
made
rankin
dispense
with
ceremony
and
pilot
him
through
those
spaces
to
the
and
it
must
have
been
an
exaggeration
of
the
same
feeling
that
made
him
regardless
of
his
wife
uplifted
eyebrows
insist
on
placing
the
guest
of
the
evening
between
maddox
and
himself
it
was
later
on
about
the
time
when
the
wine
went
round
that
rickman
became
aware
of
a
change
of
a
subtle
undefined
hostility
in
the
air
he
wondered
whether
the
rankins
were
annoyed
with
him
because
of
his
inability
to
take
a
brilliant
part
in
the
conversation
or
to
finish
any
one
thing
that
he
took
upon
his
plate
but
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
help
it
he
was
too
tired
to
talk
and
he
had
reached
that
stage
of
hunger
when
the
desire
to
eat
no
longer
brought
with
it
the
power
of
eating
when
the
masterpieces
of
rankin
excited
only
terror
and
repugnance
he
ate
sparingly
as
starving
men
must
eat
and
he
drank
more
sparingly
than
he
ate
for
he
feared
the
probable
effect
of
unwonted
stimulants
so
that
his
glass
appeared
ever
to
be
full
the
hostility
was
more
herbert
rankin
attitude
than
that
of
her
husband
but
he
noticed
a
melancholy
change
in
rankin
his
geniality
had
vanished
or
lingered
only
in
the
curl
of
his
moustache
he
was
less
amusing
than
of
old
his
conversation
was
no
longer
that
of
the
junior
journalist
flinging
himself
recklessly
into
the
tide
of
talk
but
whatever
topic
was
started
he
turned
it
to
himself
he
was
exceedingly
indignant
on
the
subject
of
the
war
which
he
regarded
more
as
a
personal
grievance
than
as
a
national
calamity
no
doubt
it
was
his
eminence
that
constituted
him
the
centre
of
so
vast
a
range
the
worst
of
it
is
said
he
whichever
side
beats
it
destruction
to
royalties
i
lost
a
clean
thousand
on
spion
kop
and
i
can
tell
you
i
did
recover
much
on
mafeking
though
i
worked
tommy
atkins
for
all
he
was
worth
this
year
my
sales
have
dropped
from
fifty
to
thirty
thousand
i
ca
stand
many
more
of
these
reverses
he
paused
dubious
between
two
if
it
had
that
effect
on
said
the
great
man
heaven
only
knows
what
it
done
to
other
people
how
about
you
rickman
oh
i
all
right
thanks
the
war
had
ruined
him
but
his
ruin
was
not
the
point
of
view
from
which
he
had
yet
seriously
regarded
it
he
was
frankly
disgusted
with
his
old
friend
tone
if
it
goes
on
much
longer
i
shall
be
obliged
said
rankin
solemnly
to
go
out
to
the
seat
of
war
rickman
felt
a
momentary
glow
he
was
exhilarated
by
the
idea
of
rankin
at
the
seat
of
war
he
said
he
could
see
rankin
sitting
on
it
rankin
laughed
for
he
was
not
wholly
dead
to
the
humour
of
his
own
celebrity
but
there
was
a
faint
silken
rustle
at
the
head
of
the
table
subtle
and
hostile
like
the
stirring
of
a
snake
herbert
rankin
bent
her
fine
flat
brows
towards
the
poet
with
a
look
ominous
and
intent
the
look
was
lost
upon
rickman
and
he
wondered
why
maddox
pressed
his
foot
have
you
written
anything
on
the
war
mr
rickman
she
asked
no
i
have
written
anything
on
the
war
she
looked
at
him
almost
contemptuously
as
at
a
fool
who
had
neglected
an
opportunity
what
do
you
generally
write
on
then
rickman
looked
up
with
a
piteous
smile
he
was
beginning
to
feel
very
miserable
and
weary
and
he
longed
to
get
up
and
go
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
no
end
to
that
dinner
no
end
to
the
pitiless
ingenuity
of
rankin
and
he
always
had
hated
being
stared
at
i
do
generally
write
on
anything
he
said
your
last
poem
is
an
exception
to
your
rule
then
it
is
i
wrote
most
of
on
gin
and
water
said
rickman
desperately
rankin
had
tugged
all
the
geniality
out
of
his
moustache
and
his
face
was
full
of
anxiety
and
gloom
maddox
tried
hard
not
to
snigger
he
was
not
fond
of
herbert
rankin
and
rankin
continued
to
send
forth
his
swift
and
fair
creations
rickman
felt
his
forehead
grow
cold
and
damp
he
leaned
back
and
wiped
it
with
his
handkerchief
a
glance
passed
between
maddox
and
rankin
but
old
rankin
looked
at
him
and
the
motherhood
stirred
in
her
heart
wo
you
change
places
with
me
i
expect
you
feeling
that
fire
too
much
at
your
back
maddox
plucked
his
sleeve
better
stay
where
you
are
he
whispered
rickman
rose
instantly
to
his
feet
the
horrible
conviction
was
growing
on
him
that
he
was
going
to
faint
to
faint
or
to
be
ignominiously
that
came
sometimes
of
starving
by
some
irony
of
nature
do
maddy
i
think
perhaps
surely
he
was
going
to
faint
maddox
jumped
up
and
held
him
as
he
staggered
from
the
room
rankin
looked
at
his
wife
and
his
wife
looked
at
rankin
he
may
be
a
very
great
poet
said
she
but
i
hope
you
never
ask
him
to
dine
here
again
never
i
can
promise
you
said
rankin
the
mother
had
a
kinder
voice
i
think
the
poor
fellow
was
feeling
ill
from
that
fire
well
he
might
too
said
rankin
with
all
the
bitterness
that
became
the
husband
of
elegant
respectability
go
and
make
him
lie
down
and
be
sure
and
keep
his
head
lower
than
his
feet
said
rankin
mother
i
should
be
surprised
if
ricky
head
were
considerably
lower
than
his
feet
already
said
rankin
and
when
he
said
it
the
bosses
of
his
face
grew
genial
again
as
the
old
coarse
junior
journalistic
humour
possessed
itself
of
the
situation
and
he
went
out
sniggering
and
cursing
by
turns
under
his
moustache
rankin
mother
was
right
rickman
was
feeling
very
ill
indeed
without
knowing
how
he
got
there
he
found
himself
lying
on
a
bed
in
rankin
maddox
and
rankin
were
with
him
maddox
had
taken
off
his
boots
and
loosened
his
collar
for
him
and
was
now
standing
over
him
contemplating
the
effect
that
all
very
well
said
maddox
but
how
the
dickens
am
i
to
get
him
home
especially
as
we
do
know
his
address
ask
him
i
afraid
our
hardly
in
a
state
to
give
very
reliable
information
howland
street
said
rickman
faintly
and
the
two
smiled
it
was
torrington
square
but
i
forget
the
number
howland
street
repeated
rickman
with
an
effort
to
be
distinct
maddox
shook
his
head
rickman
had
sunk
low
enough
but
it
was
incredible
to
them
that
he
should
have
sunk
as
low
as
howland
street
his
insistence
on
that
address
they
regarded
as
a
pleasantry
peculiar
to
his
state
it
perfectly
hopeless
said
maddox
i
do
see
anything
for
it
rankin
but
to
let
him
stay
where
he
is
at
that
rickman
roused
himself
from
his
stupor
if
you
only
stop
jawing
and
give
me
some
brandy
i
could
go
oh
my
aunt
said
rankin
dallying
with
his
despair
it
is
half
a
bad
idea
try
it
they
tried
it
maddox
raised
the
poet
head
and
rankin
poured
the
brandy
into
him
rankin
hand
was
gentle
but
there
was
a
sternness
about
maddox
and
his
ministrations
and
as
the
brandy
brought
the
blood
back
to
his
brain
rickman
sat
up
on
rankin
bed
murmuring
apologies
that
would
have
drawn
pity
from
the
nether
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
tenderness
that
had
warmed
him
when
he
came
he
could
see
that
they
were
anxious
to
get
him
out
of
the
house
since
they
had
been
so
keen
on
reconciliation
whence
this
change
to
hostility
and
disapproval
oh
of
course
he
remembered
he
had
been
ill
outrageously
ill
in
rankin
perhaps
it
very
nice
of
him
still
he
did
do
it
for
his
own
amusement
and
rankin
might
have
been
as
ill
as
he
liked
in
if
he
had
had
one
even
admitting
that
the
nature
of
his
calamity
was
such
as
to
place
him
beyond
the
pale
of
human
sympathy
he
thought
that
rankin
might
have
borne
himself
with
a
somewhat
better
grace
and
why
maddox
should
have
taken
that
preposterous
tone
maddox
explained
himself
as
they
left
sussex
square
rickman
did
not
at
first
take
in
the
explanation
he
was
thinking
how
he
could
best
circumvent
maddox
obvious
intention
of
hailing
a
hansom
and
putting
him
into
it
he
did
want
to
confess
that
he
had
a
shilling
in
his
pocket
coppers
anybody
may
be
short
of
and
presently
he
meant
to
borrow
twopence
for
a
bus
later
on
he
would
have
to
ask
for
a
loan
of
fifty
pounds
for
you
can
borrow
pounds
and
you
can
borrow
pennies
but
not
shillings
not
at
any
rate
if
you
are
starving
if
i
were
you
ricky
maddox
was
saying
i
should
go
straight
to
bed
when
you
get
home
you
be
all
right
in
the
morning
i
all
right
now
i
ca
think
what
bowled
me
over
ricky
the
prevarication
is
unworthy
of
you
without
humbug
i
think
you
might
keep
off
it
a
bit
before
you
dine
with
people
it
matter
about
us
you
know
but
it
hardly
the
sort
of
thing
rankin
been
accustomed
to
mrs
rankin
well
yes
i
said
rankin
but
it
not
about
her
i
care
about
you
of
course
you
tell
me
to
mind
my
own
business
but
i
wish
i
wish
to
goodness
you
give
it
up
altogether
you
did
once
why
not
again
believe
me
the
game
is
worth
the
candle
and
he
said
to
himself
noting
the
sharp
lines
of
his
friend
haggard
figure
it
killing
him
i
see
said
rickman
slowly
in
an
instant
he
saw
it
all
the
monstrous
and
abominable
suspicion
that
had
rested
upon
him
all
the
evening
it
explained
everything
he
saw
too
how
every
movement
of
his
own
had
lent
itself
to
the
intolerable
inference
it
was
so
complete
so
satisfactory
so
comprehensive
that
he
could
not
wonder
that
they
had
found
no
escape
from
it
he
could
find
none
himself
there
was
no
way
by
which
he
could
establish
the
fact
of
his
sobriety
for
it
is
the
very
nature
of
such
accusations
to
feed
upon
defence
denial
whether
humorous
or
indignant
would
but
condemn
him
more
the
very
plausibility
of
the
imputation
acted
on
him
as
a
despotic
suggestion
he
began
to
feel
that
he
must
have
been
drunk
at
rankin
that
he
was
drunk
now
while
he
was
talking
to
maddox
and
to
have
told
the
truth
to
have
said
maddy
i
starving
i
have
had
a
square
meal
for
four
months
would
have
sounded
too
like
a
beggar
whine
whatever
he
let
out
later
on
it
would
be
mean
to
spring
all
that
on
maddox
now
covering
him
with
confusion
and
remorse
he
laughed
softly
aware
that
his
very
laugh
would
be
used
as
evidence
against
him
i
see
so
you
all
thought
i
been
drinking
well
if
you
forgive
my
saying
so
oh
i
forgive
you
it
was
a
very
natural
supposition
i
think
you
have
to
apologise
to
the
rankins
i
think
the
rankins
have
to
apologise
to
me
with
every
foolish
word
he
was
more
hopelessly
immersed
he
insisted
on
parting
with
maddox
at
the
marble
arch
after
all
he
had
not
borrowed
that
fifty
pounds
nor
yet
that
twopence
luckily
rankin
brandy
enabled
him
to
walk
back
with
less
difficulty
than
he
came
it
had
also
warmed
him
so
that
he
did
not
find
out
all
at
once
that
he
had
left
his
overcoat
at
rankin
he
could
not
go
back
for
it
he
could
never
present
himself
at
that
house
again
it
was
a
frosty
night
with
a
bitter
wind
rising
in
the
east
and
blowing
up
oxford
street
his
attic
under
the
icicled
tiles
was
dark
and
narrow
as
the
grave
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
thin
wall
a
hunger
more
infernal
and
malignant
than
his
own
waited
stealthily
for
its
prey
chapter
lxxi
it
was
five
and
dicky
pilkington
was
at
his
ease
stretched
before
the
fire
in
a
low
chair
in
the
of
the
flat
he
now
habitually
shared
with
poppy
grace
it
was
beatitude
to
lie
there
with
his
legs
nicely
toasting
to
have
his
tea
which
he
did
not
drink
poured
out
for
him
by
the
most
popular
little
variety
actress
in
london
and
to
know
that
she
had
found
in
him
her
master
this
evening
his
intellect
in
play
under
many
genial
influences
dicky
was
once
more
raising
the
pæan
of
finance
under
some
piquant
provocation
too
for
poppy
had
just
informed
him
that
she
did
fancy
his
business
now
look
here
said
dicky
you
call
yourself
an
artist
well
this
business
of
mine
is
a
business
it
an
art
think
of
the
delicacy
we
to
use
to
know
to
a
hairsbreadth
how
far
you
can
go
with
a
man
to
know
when
to
give
him
his
head
with
the
snaffle
and
when
to
draw
him
in
with
the
curb
it
a
feelin
your
way
all
along
why
i
knew
a
fellow
a
broker
an
uncommonly
clever
chap
he
was
too
ruined
just
for
want
of
a
little
tact
he
was
too
precipitate
began
hauling
his
man
up
just
when
he
ought
to
have
let
him
go
he
no
imagination
that
fellow
do
you
go
eating
too
much
cake
popsie
or
make
your
little
nose
red
i
do
know
any
other
profession
gives
you
such
a
grip
of
life
and
such
a
feelin
of
power
you
got
some
young
devil
plungin
about
kickin
up
his
heels
all
over
the
shop
say
he
thinks
he
got
the
whole
place
to
break
his
neck
in
and
you
know
the
exact
minute
by
your
watch
that
you
can
bring
him
in
grovellin
on
your
office
floor
it
the
iron
in
the
velvet
glove
said
dicky
i
know
what
you
driving
at
and
i
call
it
a
beastly
shame
no
it
is
i
should
wonder
if
old
rickets
paid
up
all
right
after
all
and
if
he
does
if
he
does
well
i
say
though
think
wot
a
lot
he
paid
you
ca
you
let
him
go
dicky
shook
his
head
and
smiled
softly
as
at
some
interior
vision
you
ruin
him
for
a
dirty
fifty
pounds
i
wo
ruin
him
and
it
is
for
the
money
it
for
the
game
i
like
said
dicky
to
see
a
man
play
in
style
but
i
do
blame
him
if
he
has
got
style
so
long
as
he
got
pluck
in
fact
i
do
know
that
of
the
two
i
would
rather
have
pluck
seen
a
good
many
men
play
this
game
but
i
never
seen
any
one
who
came
up
to
old
razors
for
pluck
style
it
a
treat
to
see
him
do
you
suppose
i
going
to
cut
in
now
and
spoil
it
all
by
giving
him
points
that
would
take
all
the
gilt
off
the
gingerbread
and
do
you
suppose
he
let
me
not
he
he
spreading
the
gilt
on
thick
and
he
see
me
d
d
first
dicky
smoked
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire
in
speechless
admiration
he
felt
that
he
was
encouraging
the
display
of
high
heroism
by
watching
it
he
singled
out
a
beautiful
writhing
flame
spat
at
it
and
continued
no
i
take
good
care
that
rickets
does
starve
but
i
going
to
stand
by
and
see
him
finish
fair
if
you
like
popsie
you
can
back
him
to
win
i
do
care
if
he
win
it
would
be
worth
it
for
what
i
got
out
of
him
by
what
he
had
got
out
of
him
dicky
meant
not
three
thousand
seven
hundred
and
odd
pounds
but
a
spectacle
beyond
all
comparison
exciting
and
sublime
for
that
he
was
prepared
to
abandon
any
further
advantage
that
might
be
wrung
from
the
harden
library
by
a
successful
manipulation
of
the
sales
poppy
did
not
back
rickman
to
win
but
she
determined
to
call
on
him
at
his
rooms
and
leave
a
little
note
with
a
cheque
and
a
request
that
he
would
pay
dicky
and
have
done
with
him
you
better
owe
it
to
me
than
to
him
old
chappy
thus
she
wrote
in
the
kindness
and
impropriety
of
her
heart
but
rickman
never
got
that
little
note
chapter
lxxii
of
all
the
consequences
of
that
terrible
dinner
at
rankin
there
was
none
that
rickman
resented
more
than
the
loss
of
his
overcoat
as
he
lay
between
his
blankets
he
still
felt
all
the
lashings
of
the
east
wind
around
his
shivering
body
he
was
awake
all
that
night
and
the
morning
found
him
feverish
with
terror
of
the
illness
that
might
overtake
him
before
he
attained
his
end
he
stayed
in
bed
all
day
to
prevent
it
and
because
of
his
weakness
and
for
warmth
but
the
next
day
there
came
a
mild
and
merciful
thaw
a
tenderness
of
heaven
that
was
felt
even
under
the
tiles
in
howland
street
and
the
morning
of
that
day
brought
a
thing
that
in
all
his
dreams
he
had
not
yet
dreamed
of
a
letter
from
lucia
he
read
it
kneeling
on
the
floor
of
his
garret
supporting
himself
by
the
edge
of
the
table
it
was
only
a
few
lines
in
praise
of
the
elegy
which
had
appeared
in
the
week
before
and
a
postscript
that
told
him
she
would
be
staying
at
court
house
with
miss
palliser
till
the
summer
he
knelt
there
a
long
time
with
his
head
bowed
upon
his
arms
his
brains
failed
him
when
he
tried
to
write
an
answer
and
he
put
the
letter
into
his
where
it
lay
like
a
loving
hand
against
his
heart
and
yet
there
was
not
a
word
of
love
in
it
the
old
indomitable
hope
rose
in
his
heart
again
and
he
forced
himself
to
eat
and
drink
that
he
might
have
strength
for
the
things
he
had
to
do
that
night
he
did
not
sleep
but
lay
wrapt
in
his
beatific
passion
his
longing
was
so
intense
that
it
created
a
vision
of
the
thing
it
longed
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
heard
lucia
soft
footfall
about
his
bed
that
she
came
and
sat
beside
his
pillow
that
she
bowed
her
head
upon
his
breast
and
that
her
long
hair
drifted
over
him
for
the
beating
of
his
own
heart
gave
him
the
sense
of
a
presence
beside
him
all
night
long
as
he
lay
with
his
right
arm
flung
across
his
own
starved
body
guarding
her
letter
the
letter
that
had
not
a
word
of
love
in
it
in
the
morning
he
discovered
that
another
letter
had
lain
on
his
table
under
lucia
it
was
from
dicky
pilkington
reminding
him
that
it
wanted
but
seven
days
to
the
thirtieth
dicky
said
nothing
about
any
willingness
to
renew
the
bill
what
did
it
matter
dicky
would
renew
it
dicky
must
renew
it
he
felt
that
there
was
force
in
him
to
compel
dicky
to
renew
it
he
went
out
and
bought
a
paper
with
the
price
of
a
meal
of
milk
he
could
pawn
his
good
clothes
their
assistance
was
too
valuable
in
interviews
with
possible
employers
he
found
the
advertisement
of
an
exeter
bookseller
in
want
of
a
foreman
and
expert
cataloguer
at
a
salary
of
ninety
pounds
he
answered
it
by
return
in
the
list
of
his
credentials
he
mentioned
that
he
had
catalogued
the
harden
library
a
feat
as
he
knew
sufficient
to
constitute
him
a
celebrity
in
the
eyes
of
the
exeter
man
he
added
that
if
the
bookseller
felt
inclined
to
consider
his
application
he
would
be
obliged
by
a
wire
as
he
had
several
other
situations
in
view
the
bookseller
wired
engaging
him
for
six
months
the
same
day
came
a
cheque
for
ten
pounds
from
the
honorarium
for
the
elegy
he
sent
the
ten
pounds
to
dicky
at
once
by
way
of
showing
what
he
could
do
with
a
curt
note
informing
him
of
his
appointment
and
requesting
a
renewal
for
three
months
by
which
time
his
salary
would
cover
the
remainder
still
owing
feeling
that
no
further
intellectual
efforts
were
now
required
of
him
he
went
out
to
feed
on
the
fresh
air
as
he
crossed
the
landing
an
odour
of
hot
pottage
came
to
meet
him
through
the
door
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
woman
form
throned
as
it
were
above
clouds
of
curling
steam
a
voice
went
out
hoarse
with
a
supreme
emotion
come
in
you
there
and
a
snack
wontcher
it
said
no
thank
you
he
answered
garn
then
i
snack
yer
for
a
y
fool
and
from
the
peaceableness
of
the
reply
he
gathered
that
this
time
the
lady
was
not
soliciting
patronage
but
conferring
it
he
was
no
longer
hungry
no
longer
weighed
upon
by
his
exhausted
body
a
great
restlessness
had
seized
it
a
desire
to
walk
to
walk
on
and
on
without
stopping
the
young
day
had
lured
him
into
the
park
so
gentle
was
the
weather
that
but
for
bare
branches
and
blanched
sky
it
might
have
been
a
day
in
spring
as
he
walked
he
experienced
sensations
of
indescribable
delicacy
and
lightness
he
saw
ahead
of
him
pellucid
golden
vistas
of
metaphysical
splendour
he
skimmed
over
fields
of
elastic
air
with
the
ease
and
ecstasy
of
a
blessed
spirit
when
he
came
in
he
found
that
the
experience
prolonged
itself
through
the
early
night
even
when
he
lay
motionless
on
his
bed
staring
at
the
wall
and
as
he
stared
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
passed
upon
the
wall
clouds
upon
clouds
of
exquisite
and
evanescent
colour
and
that
strange
forms
appeared
and
moved
upon
the
clouds
he
saw
a
shoal
of
fishes
they
fishes
radiant
iridescent
gorgeous
fishes
with
the
tails
of
peacocks
they
swam
round
and
round
the
room
just
under
the
cornice
an
frieze
he
was
immensely
interested
in
these
decorative
hallucinations
his
brain
seemed
to
be
lifted
up
to
be
iridescent
also
to
swim
round
and
round
with
the
swimming
fishes
he
woke
late
in
the
morning
with
a
violent
sore
throat
and
pain
in
all
his
body
he
was
too
giddy
to
sit
up
and
help
himself
but
he
knocked
weakly
on
the
thin
wall
his
neighbour
roused
herself
at
the
faint
summons
and
appeared
she
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
and
contemplated
him
for
a
moment
he
tried
to
speak
but
his
tongue
seemed
to
be
stuck
burning
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
he
pointed
to
his
throat
yes
i
dessay
said
she
i
said
you
get
somefing
and
you
got
it
so
saying
she
disappeared
into
her
own
apartment
as
he
saw
her
go
despair
shook
him
he
thought
that
he
was
abandoned
but
presently
she
returned
bringing
a
cup
of
hot
tea
with
a
dash
of
gin
in
it
from
her
own
breakfast
i
a
seen
to
you
afore
ef
you
let
me
she
said
you
tyke
it
from
me
young
man
wot
you
wants
is
a
good
hot
lining
to
your
belly
given
it
to
you
ef
you
a
let
me
i
a
lydy
as
tykes
her
dinner
i
am
no
you
do
this
as
he
turned
away
his
head
in
protest
she
however
secured
it
firmly
with
one
filthy
hand
while
with
the
other
she
held
the
reeking
cup
to
his
lips
she
had
put
it
to
her
own
first
to
test
the
heat
and
quality
of
the
brew
yet
he
was
grateful
he
had
some
difficulty
in
swallowing
and
from
time
to
time
she
wiped
his
mouth
with
her
villainous
apron
and
he
was
grateful
still
having
passed
beyond
disgust
she
perceived
the
gratitude
garn
said
she
wot
a
cup
er
tea
i
a
seen
to
yer
afore
ef
you
a
let
me
she
continued
her
ministrations
she
brought
coal
in
her
own
scuttle
and
after
immense
pains
she
lighted
a
fire
in
the
wretched
grate
then
she
smoothed
his
till
they
were
covered
with
her
smutty
trail
she
would
have
gone
for
a
doctor
then
and
there
but
difficulty
arose
for
doctors
meant
hospitals
and
the
man
below
threatened
to
sell
his
lodger
sticks
if
rent
were
not
forthcoming
she
cast
her
eyes
about
in
search
of
pawnable
articles
they
fell
upon
his
clothes
she
took
up
his
shirt
and
examined
it
carefully
appraising
the
sleeve
links
and
the
studs
but
when
she
touched
the
coat
the
coat
that
had
lucia
letter
in
the
rickman
turned
in
his
bed
and
made
agonizing
signs
struggling
with
the
voice
that
perished
in
his
burning
throat
wot
the
good
said
she
of
a
suit
when
yer
ca
wear
it
as
i
telled
you
wot
you
wa
no
the
no
sorter
use
your
making
fyces
at
me
and
you
keep
your
y
legs
in
or
i
the
propositions
that
followed
were
murmured
in
a
hoarse
but
crooning
tone
such
as
a
mother
might
have
used
to
soothe
a
fractious
child
she
went
away
carrying
the
clothes
with
her
and
turned
out
the
pockets
in
her
den
on
her
return
she
sent
the
man
below
to
fetch
the
doctor
but
the
man
below
fell
in
with
boon
companions
on
the
way
and
no
doctor
came
all
that
night
the
woman
watched
by
rickman
bedside
heedless
of
her
luck
she
kept
life
in
him
by
feeding
him
with
warm
milk
and
gin
a
teaspoonful
at
a
time
rickman
aware
of
footsteps
in
the
room
fancied
himself
back
again
in
rankin
the
whole
scene
of
that
evening
floated
before
him
all
night
long
he
had
a
sense
of
presences
hostile
and
offended
of
being
irretrievably
disgraced
in
the
recurring
nightmare
he
saw
lucia
harden
instead
of
rankin
so
persistently
did
he
see
her
that
when
he
woke
he
could
not
shake
off
the
impression
that
she
had
been
actually
if
unaccountably
present
a
spectator
of
his
uttermost
disgrace
he
could
never
look
her
in
the
face
again
no
for
he
was
disgraced
absolutely
irredeemably
atrociously
disgraced
beyond
all
possibility
of
explanation
and
defence
though
he
sometimes
caught
himself
explaining
and
pleading
against
those
offended
phantoms
of
his
brain
why
should
he
suffer
so
just
because
of
his
inability
to
deal
with
rankin
dinner
or
to
pay
a
debt
of
millions
many
millions
of
figures
that
climbed
up
the
wall
he
was
not
sure
which
of
these
two
obligations
was
laid
upon
him
he
became
by
turns
delirious
and
drowsy
and
the
woman
fetched
a
doctor
early
the
next
day
he
found
enteric
and
also
of
which
rickman
illness
at
the
rankins
must
have
been
the
first
warning
symptoms
he
have
to
go
to
the
hospital
but
you
better
send
word
to
his
friends
ai
got
no
friends
and
dunno
is
the
doctor
said
to
himself
gone
under
and
looked
round
him
for
a
clue
he
examined
a
postcard
from
spinks
and
a
parcel
containing
an
overcoat
from
rankin
with
the
novelist
name
and
address
inside
the
wrapper
the
poet
name
was
familiar
to
the
doctor
who
read
he
first
of
all
made
arrangements
for
removing
his
patient
to
the
hospital
then
in
his
uncertainty
he
telegraphed
to
jewdwine
to
rankin
and
to
spinks
the
news
of
rickman
illness
was
thus
spread
rapidly
among
his
friends
it
brought
spinks
that
afternoon
and
flossie
the
poor
beaver
dragged
to
howland
street
by
her
husband
to
see
what
her
woman
hands
could
do
they
entered
upon
a
scene
of
indescribable
confusion
and
clangour
poppy
grace
arrived
on
her
errand
for
which
she
had
attired
herself
in
a
red
dress
and
ermine
tippet
had
mounted
guard
over
the
unconscious
poet
ricky
cried
poppy
bending
over
him
wo
you
speak
to
me
poppy
dear
do
you
know
me
no
do
know
yer
so
you
need
arsk
poppy
placed
her
minute
figure
defiantly
between
rickman
and
her
rival
of
the
open
door
she
had
exhausted
her
emotions
in
those
wild
cries
and
was
prepared
to
enjoy
the
moment
which
produced
in
her
the
hallucination
of
virtue
the
woman
voluble
and
fierce
began
to
describe
miss
character
in
powerful
but
somewhat
exaggerated
language
appealing
to
the
to
vindicate
her
accuracy
poppy
seated
herself
on
the
bed
and
held
a
to
her
virtuous
nose
it
was
the
dumb
and
dignified
rebuke
of
propriety
in
an
ermine
tippet
to
vice
made
manifest
in
the
infamy
of
rags
the
beaver
retreated
in
terror
on
to
the
landing
where
she
stood
clutching
the
little
basket
of
jellies
and
things
which
she
had
brought
as
if
she
feared
that
it
might
be
torn
from
her
in
the
violence
of
the
scene
spinks
convulsed
with
anguish
by
the
sight
of
his
friend
lying
there
unconscious
could
only
offer
an
inarticulate
expostulation
it
was
the
signal
for
the
woman
to
burst
into
passionate
i
ai
took
nothing
wot
the
boss
myde
me
fer
a
doctor
ses
you

i
do

messing
round
an
cartin
orf
to
the
afore
paid
rent
ses
the
entrance
of
maddox
and
rankin
checked
the
hideous
flow
they
were
followed
by
the
porters
of
the
hospital
and
the
nurse
in
charge
her
presence
commanded
instantaneous
calm
there
are
far
too
many
people
in
this
room
said
she
her
expelling
glance
fell
first
on
poppy
throned
on
the
bed
then
on
the
convulsive
spinks
she
turned
more
gently
to
rankin
in
whose
mouth
she
saw
remonstrance
and
to
maddox
in
whose
eyes
she
read
despair
it
will
really
be
better
for
him
to
take
him
to
the
hospital
no
cried
spinks
darting
in
again
from
the
landing
take
him
to
my
house
dalmeny
av
but
the
beaver
plucked
him
by
the
sleeve
for
she
thought
of
muriel
maud
no
no
take
him
to
mine
sussex
square
said
rankin
and
he
insisted
but
in
the
end
he
suffered
himself
to
be
overruled
for
he
thought
darkly
of
his
wife
i
give
half
my
popularity
if
i
could
save
him
he
said
to
maddox
half
your
popularity
wo
save
him
nor
yet
the
whole
of
it
said
maddox
savagely
in
that
moment
they
hated
themselves
and
each
other
for
the
wrong
they
had
done
him
their
hearts
smote
them
as
they
thought
of
the
brutalities
of
sunday
night
the
woman
still
held
her
ground
in
the
centre
of
the
room
where
she
stood
scowling
at
the
nurse
as
she
busied
herself
about
the
bed
i
a
seen
to
ef
a
let
me
she
reiterated
maddox
dealt
with
her
he
flicked
a
sovereign
on
to
the
table
look
here
said
he
suppose
you
take
that
and
go
out
quietly
there
was
a
momentary
glitter
in
her
eyes
but
her
fingers
hesitated
i
didn
fink
no
frien
wen
i
come
in
it
was
her
way
of
intimating
that
what
she
had
done
she
had
not
done
for
money
all
right
take
it
she
drew
out
a
filthy
grey
flannel
bag
from
the
bosom
of
her
gown
and
slipped
the
gold
into
it
and
still
she
hesitated
she
could
not
understand
why
so
large
a
sum
was
offered
for
such
slight
services
as
she
had
rendered
it
must
have
been
for
another
thought
stirred
in
her
brute
brain
they
were
raising
rickman
in
his
bed
before
taking
him
away
his
shoulders
were
supported
on
the
nurse
arm
his
head
dropped
on
her
breast
the
posture
revealed
all
the
weakness
of
his
slender
body
the
woman
turned
and
as
she
looked
at
the
helpless
figure
she
was
visited
by
a
dim
sense
of
something
strange
and
beautiful
and
pure
something
his
helplessness
perhaps
that
was
outraged
by
her
presence
and
called
for
vindication
never
no
truck
with
me
she
said
it
struck
maddox
that
the
denial
had
a
sublimity
and
pathos
of
its
own
she
dropped
the
bag
into
her
lean
bosom
and
went
out
and
the
porters
wrapped
him
in
his
blankets
and
laid
him
on
a
stretcher
and
carried
him
out
past
maddox
and
rankin
who
turned
their
heads
away
past
flossie
who
shrank
a
little
from
the
blankets
but
cried
softly
to
see
him
go
and
past
the
woman
standing
on
her
threshold
and
in
that
manner
he
passed
horace
jewdwine
coming
up
the
stair
too
late
and
all
that
jewdwine
could
do
was
to
stand
back
and
let
him
pass
it
was
jewdwine
fear
that
made
him
uncover
as
in
the
presence
of
the
dead
chapter
lxxiii
when
rankin
maddox
and
jewdwine
stood
alone
in
the
garret
whence
they
had
seen
rickman
carried
away
from
them
remorse
drove
all
hope
of
his
recovery
from
their
hearts
they
learnt
some
of
the
truth
about
him
from
the
woman
in
the
next
room
a
keen
observer
of
human
nature
jewdwine
and
rankin
when
they
too
had
paid
her
for
her
services
were
glad
to
escape
from
the
intolerable
scene
maddox
stayed
behind
collecting
what
he
could
only
think
of
as
rickman
literary
remains
he
found
in
the
table
drawer
three
unpublished
articles
a
few
poems
and
the
first
act
of
the
second
and
unfinished
tragedy
saved
by
its
obscure
position
at
the
back
of
the
drawer
the
woman
owned
to
having
lit
the
fire
with
the
rest
maddox
cursed
and
groaned
as
he
thought
of
that
destruction
he
knew
that
many
poems
which
followed
had
remained
unpublished
had
they
too
been
taken
to
light
the
fire
he
turned
the
garret
upside
down
in
search
of
the
missing
manuscripts
at
last
in
a
cupboard
he
came
upon
a
leather
bag
it
was
locked
and
he
could
find
no
key
but
he
wrenched
it
open
with
the
poker
it
contained
many
manuscripts
among
them
the
nine
and
twenty
sonnets
and
the
testament
concerning
them
he
read
the
sonnets
but
not
the
other
document
which
was
in
a
sealed
envelope
he
found
also
a
bundle
of
dicky
pilkington
receipts
and
his
last
letter
threatening
foreclosure
and
when
he
had
packed
up
the
books
lucia
books
and
redeemed
rickman
clothes
from
the
he
took
all
these
things
away
with
him
for
safety
there
was
little
he
could
do
for
rickman
but
he
promised
himself
the
pleasure
of
settling
dicky
claim
but
even
that
satisfaction
was
denied
him
for
dicky
had
just
renewed
his
bill
for
a
nominal
three
months
nominal
only
dicky
had
in
view
a
magnificent
renunciation
and
he
flatly
refused
to
treat
with
maddox
or
anybody
else
he
was
completely
satisfied
with
this
conclusion
it
meant
that
rickman
for
all
his
style
and
pluck
had
lost
the
game
and
that
he
pilkington
had
done
the
handsome
thing
as
he
could
do
it
when
the
fancy
took
him
for
dicky
heart
had
been
touched
by
the
tale
that
poppy
told
him
and
it
melted
altogether
when
he
went
and
saw
for
himself
poor
ricky
lying
in
his
cot
in
the
hospital
he
had
a
great
deal
of
nice
feeling
about
him
after
all
had
dicky
terrible
days
followed
rickman
removal
to
the
hospital
days
when
his
friends
seemed
justified
in
their
sad
conviction
days
when
the
doctors
gave
up
hope
days
when
he
would
relapse
after
some
brief
recovery
days
when
he
kept
them
all
in
agonizing
suspense
but
rickman
did
not
die
as
they
said
it
was
not
in
him
to
take
that
exquisitely
mean
revenge
it
was
not
in
him
to
truckle
to
the
tradition
that
ordains
that
unfortunate
young
poets
shall
starve
in
garrets
and
die
in
hospitals
he
had
always
been
an
upsetter
of
conventions
and
a
law
unto
himself
so
there
came
a
day
about
the
middle
of
march
when
he
astonished
them
all
by
appearing
among
them
suddenly
in
maddox
rooms
less
haggard
than
he
had
been
that
night
when
he
sat
starving
at
rankin
and
as
he
came
back
to
them
to
jewdwine
to
maddox
and
to
rankin
they
each
could
say
no
more
to
him
than
they
had
said
five
years
ago
what
a
fool
you
were
rickman
why
did
you
come
to
but
when
the
others
had
left
maddox
put
his
hands
on
rickman
shoulders
and
they
looked
each
other
in
the
face
i
say
ricky
what
did
you
do
it
for
but
that
was
more
than
rickman
could
explain
even
to
maddox
they
had
all
contended
which
should
receive
him
when
he
came
out
of
hospital
but
it
was
settled
that
for
the
present
he
should
remain
with
maddox
in
his
rooms
there
dicky
absolutely
prepared
to
do
the
handsome
thing
called
upon
him
at
an
early
date
dicky
had
promised
himself
some
exquisite
sensations
in
the
moment
of
magnanimity
but
the
moment
never
came
rickman
remained
firm
in
his
determination
that
every
shilling
of
the
debt
should
be
paid
and
paid
by
him
it
was
more
than
covered
by
the
money
maddox
advanced
for
his
literary
remains
dicky
had
to
own
that
the
plucky
little
fellow
had
won
his
game
but
he
added
you
could
have
done
it
razors
if
i
had
given
you
points
the
great
thing
was
that
he
had
done
it
and
that
the
harden
library
was
his
was
lucia
it
only
remained
to
tell
her
and
to
hand
it
over
to
her
he
had
long
ago
provided
for
this
difficult
affair
he
wrote
as
he
had
planned
to
write
with
a
judicious
hardness
brevity
and
restraint
he
told
her
that
he
desired
to
see
her
on
some
business
connected
with
the
harden
library
in
which
he
was
endeavouring
to
carry
out
as
far
as
possible
his
father
last
wishes
he
asked
to
be
allowed
to
call
on
her
some
afternoon
in
the
following
week
he
thanked
her
for
her
letter
without
further
reference
and
he
remained
sincerely
no
faithfully
hers
he
told
maddox
that
he
thought
of
going
down
to
devonshire
to
recruit
chapter
lxxiv
lucia
was
suffering
from
the
disagreeable
strain
of
a
divided
mind
to
begin
with
she
was
not
altogether
pleased
with
rickman
he
had
taken
no
notice
of
the
friendly
little
letter
she
had
written
about
the
elegy
her
evident
intention
being
to
give
him
pleasure
she
had
written
it
on
impulse
carried
away
by
her
ardent
admiration
that
was
another
of
those
passionate
indiscreet
things
which
were
followed
by
torments
of
her
pride
and
the
torments
had
followed
his
two
silence
had
reproved
her
ardour
had
intimated
to
her
that
he
was
in
no
mood
to
enter
in
at
the
door
which
she
had
closed
to
him
three
years
ago
she
took
it
that
he
had
regarded
her
poor
little
olive
branch
as
an
audacity
and
now
that
he
written
there
was
not
a
word
about
the
subject
of
her
letter
he
had
only
written
because
business
compelled
him
and
his
tone
was
not
only
cold
but
positively
austere
but
she
reflected
business
after
all
did
not
compel
him
to
come
down
and
see
her
having
reached
this
point
she
became
aware
that
her
heart
was
beating
most
uncomfortably
at
the
bare
idea
of
seeing
him
for
the
first
time
this
anticipation
inspired
her
with
anxiety
and
fear
until
their
last
meeting
in
tavistock
place
there
had
been
in
all
their
intercourse
something
intangible
and
rare
something
that
though
on
her
part
it
had
lacked
the
warmth
of
love
she
had
acknowledged
to
be
finer
than
any
friendship
that
beautiful
intangible
quality
had
perished
in
the
stress
of
their
final
meeting
and
even
if
it
came
to
life
again
it
could
never
be
the
same
or
so
she
thought
she
had
perceived
how
much
its
permanence
had
depended
on
external
barriers
on
the
social
gulf
and
on
the
dividing
presence
of
another
woman
she
could
not
separate
him
from
his
genius
and
his
genius
had
long
ago
overleapt
the
social
gulf
and
now
without
poor
flossie
without
the
safeguard
of
his
engagement
she
felt
herself
insecure
and
shelterless
more
than
ever
since
he
had
overleapt
that
barrier
too
but
though
lucia
had
found
out
all
these
things
she
had
not
yet
found
out
why
it
was
that
she
had
been
so
glad
to
hear
that
keith
rickman
was
going
to
be
married
nor
why
she
had
been
so
passionately
eager
to
keep
him
to
his
engagement
in
any
case
she
could
not
have
borne
to
be
the
cause
of
unhappiness
to
another
woman
and
that
motive
was
so
natural
that
it
served
for
all
as
things
had
turned
out
if
he
had
married
that
she
had
understood
would
have
been
such
a
closing
of
the
door
as
would
have
shut
him
out
for
ever
and
now
that
he
was
knocking
at
the
door
again
now
that
there
was
no
reason
why
once
opened
it
should
not
remain
open
she
began
to
be
afraid
of
what
might
enter
in
with
him
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
not
let
him
in
so
she
sat
down
and
wrote
a
cold
little
note
to
say
that
she
was
afraid
she
would
not
be
able
to
see
him
next
week
could
he
not
explain
the
business
in
writing
she
took
that
letter
to
the
post
herself
and
as
each
step
brought
her
nearer
to
the
inevitable
act
the
conviction
grew
on
her
that
this
conduct
of
hers
was
cowardly
and
unworthy
both
of
him
and
of
herself
a
refusal
to
see
him
was
a
confession
of
fear
and
fear
assumed
the
existence
of
the
very
thing
his
letter
had
ignored
it
was
absurd
too
if
he
had
come
to
see
that
his
feeling
for
her
was
as
she
persisted
in
believing
it
to
be
a
piece
of
poetic
folly
an
illusion
of
the
literary
imagination
she
turned
back
and
tore
up
that
cold
little
note
and
wrote
another
that
said
she
would
be
very
glad
to
see
him
any
day
next
week
except
friday
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
have
excepted
friday
but
it
sounded
more
somehow
she
did
not
take
kitty
into
her
confidence
and
in
this
she
failed
to
perceive
the
significance
of
her
own
secrecy
she
told
herself
that
there
was
no
need
to
ask
kitty
advice
because
she
knew
perfectly
well
already
what
kitty
advice
would
be
he
came
on
tuesday
monday
was
too
early
for
his
wednesday
too
late
for
his
impatience
he
had
looked
to
find
everything
altered
in
and
about
court
house
and
he
saw
almost
with
surprise
the
same
april
flowers
growing
in
the
green
garden
and
the
same
dreaming
on
the
lawn
he
recognized
the
black
rifts
in
its
trunk
and
the
shining
sweep
of
its
branches
overhead
the
door
was
opened
by
robert
and
robert
remembered
him
there
was
a
shade
more
gravity
in
the
affectionate
welcome
but
then
robert
was
nine
years
older
he
was
shown
into
the
and
it
too
was
much
as
he
had
left
it
nine
years
ago
kitty
palliser
was
there
she
rose
to
meet
him
with
her
irrepressible
friendliness
undiminished
by
nine
years
there
was
nothing
cold
and
about
kitty
will
you
tell
miss
harden
said
she
to
the
detached
retreating
robert
then
she
held
out
her
hand
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
but
a
wave
of
compassion
rather
than
of
gladness
swept
over
her
face
as
she
looked
at
him
she
made
him
sit
down
and
gave
him
tea
there
was
a
marked
gentleness
in
all
her
movements
unlike
the
hilarious
lady
she
used
to
be
the
minutes
went
by
and
lucia
did
not
appear
he
could
not
attend
to
what
kitty
was
saying
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
door
that
looked
as
if
it
were
never
going
to
open
kitty
seemed
to
bear
tenderly
with
his
abstraction
once
he
glanced
round
the
room
recognizing
familiar
objects
he
had
expected
after
dicky
descent
on
court
house
to
find
nothing
recognizable
in
it
kitty
was
telling
him
how
an
uncle
of
hers
had
lent
them
the
house
for
a
year
how
he
had
bought
it
furnished
and
how
but
for
the
dismantled
library
and
portrait
gallery
it
was
pretty
much
as
it
had
been
in
miss
harden
time
so
unchanged
was
it
and
its
atmosphere
that
rickman
felt
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
destiny
no
less
unchanging
and
familiar
he
had
come
on
business
as
he
had
done
nine
years
ago
and
he
felt
that
the
events
of
that
time
must
in
some
way
repeat
themselves
that
when
he
was
alone
with
lucia
he
would
say
to
her
such
things
as
he
had
said
before
that
there
would
be
differences
misunderstandings
as
before
and
that
his
second
coming
would
end
in
misery
and
separation
like
the
first
it
seemed
to
him
that
kitty
kind
kitty
had
the
same
perception
and
foreboding
thus
he
interpreted
her
very
evident
compassion
she
meant
to
console
him
robert
remembers
you
said
she
that
very
clever
of
robert
said
he
no
it
only
his
faithfulness
what
a
funny
thing
faithfulness
is
robert
wo
allow
any
one
but
miss
harden
to
be
mistress
here
my
people
are
interlopers
abominations
of
desolation
he
can
barely
be
civil
to
their
friends
but
to
hers
he
is
as
you
see
him
it
a
good
thing
for
me
i
her
friend
or
he
would
let
me
sit
here
and
pour
out
tea
for
you
he
thought
over
the
speech
it
admitted
an
encouraging
interpretation
but
miss
palliser
may
have
been
more
consoling
than
she
had
meant
she
rattled
on
in
the
kindness
of
her
heart
he
was
grateful
for
her
presence
it
calmed
his
agitation
and
prepared
him
to
meet
lucia
with
composure
when
she
came
but
lucia
did
not
come
and
he
began
to
have
a
horrible
fear
that
at
the
last
moment
she
would
fail
him
he
refused
the
second
cup
that
kitty
pressed
on
him
and
she
looked
at
him
compassionately
again
he
was
so
used
to
his
appearance
that
he
had
forgotten
how
it
might
strike
other
people
he
was
conscious
only
of
kitty
efforts
to
fill
up
agreeably
these
moments
of
suspense
at
last
it
ended
lucia
was
in
the
doorway
at
the
sight
of
her
his
body
shook
and
the
strength
in
his
limbs
seemed
to
dissolve
and
flow
downwards
to
the
floor
his
eyes
never
left
her
as
she
came
to
him
with
her
rhythmic
unembarrassed
motion
she
greeted
him
as
if
they
had
met
the
other
day
but
as
she
took
his
hand
she
looked
down
at
it
startled
by
its
slenderness
he
was
glad
that
she
seated
herself
on
his
right
for
he
felt
that
the
violence
of
his
heart
must
be
audible
through
his
emaciated
ribs
kitty
made
some
trivial
remark
and
lucia
turned
to
her
as
if
her
whole
soul
hung
upon
kitty
words
her
absorption
gave
him
time
to
recover
himself
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
that
was
what
she
had
turned
away
for
her
turning
enabled
him
to
look
at
her
he
noticed
that
she
seemed
in
better
health
than
when
he
had
seen
her
last
and
that
in
sign
of
it
her
beauty
was
stronger
more
vivid
and
more
defined
they
said
little
to
each
other
but
when
kitty
had
left
them
they
drew
in
their
chairs
to
the
hearth
with
something
of
the
glad
consent
of
those
for
whom
the
moment
has
arrived
he
felt
that
old
sense
of
annihilated
time
of
return
to
a
state
that
had
never
really
lapsed
and
it
struck
him
that
she
too
had
that
feeling
it
was
she
who
spoke
first
before
you
begin
your
business
tell
me
about
yourself
there
is
anything
to
tell
she
looked
as
if
she
rather
doubted
the
truth
of
that
statement
if
you
do
mind
i
rather
begin
about
the
business
and
get
it
over
why
is
it
is
it
at
all
unpleasant
he
smiled
not
in
the
least
not
in
the
very
least
it
about
the
library
i
thought
we
agreed
that
that
was
all
over
and
done
with
long
ago
well
you
see
it
has
anything
to
do
with
my
father
do
let
us
go
back
to
that
i
sorry
but
we
must
a
little
you
know
my
father
and
i
had
a
difference
of
opinion
i
know
i
know
well
in
the
end
he
owned
that
i
was
right
that
was
when
he
was
dying
he
wished
she
would
not
look
at
him
for
he
could
not
look
at
her
he
was
endeavouring
to
make
his
tale
appear
in
the
last
degree
natural
and
convincing
up
till
now
he
had
told
nothing
but
the
truth
but
as
he
was
about
to
enter
on
the
path
of
perjury
he
became
embarrassed
by
the
intentness
of
her
gaze
you
were
with
him
she
asked
yes
he
paused
a
moment
to
command
a
superior
kind
of
calm
that
pause
wrecked
him
for
it
gave
her
also
time
for
thought
he
wanted
either
to
pay
you
the
money
that
you
should
have
had
or
to
hand
over
the
library
and
i
thought
but
the
library
was
sold
he
explained
the
matter
of
the
mortgage
carefully
but
with
an
amount
of
technical
detail
meant
to
impose
and
mystify
then
how
she
asked
was
the
library
redeemed
he
repudiated
an
expression
so
charged
with
moral
and
emotional
significance
he
desired
to
lead
her
gently
away
from
a
line
of
thought
that
if
pursued
would
give
her
intelligence
the
clue
you
ca
call
it
redeemed
nobody
redeemed
it
the
debt
of
course
had
to
be
paid
out
of
my
father
estate
in
which
case
the
library
became
yours
he
smiled
involuntarily
for
she
had
him
there
and
she
knew
it
it
became
nothing
of
the
sort
and
if
it
had
i
could
hardly
go
against
my
father
wishes
by
holding
on
to
it
ca
you
see
that
it
equally
impossible
for
me
to
take
it
why
try
and
think
of
it
as
a
simple
matter
of
business
he
spoke
like
a
tired
man
straining
after
a
polite
endurance
of
her
feminine
persistence
and
refining
fantasy
it
has
anything
to
do
with
you
or
me
thus
did
he
turn
against
her
the
argument
with
which
she
had
crushed
him
in
another
such
dispute
nine
years
ago
i
am
more
than
you
are
i
remember
perfectly
well
that
your
father
paid
more
than
a
thousand
pounds
for
those
books
in
the
beginning
that
need
trouble
you
it
has
been
virtually
deducted
i
sorry
to
say
a
few
very
valuable
books
were
sold
before
the
mortgage
and
could
not
be
recovered
he
had
given
himself
away
by
that
word
recovered
her
eyes
searched
him
through
and
through
to
find
his
falsehood
as
they
had
searched
him
once
before
to
find
his
truth
it
is
very
very
good
of
you
she
said
of
am
bothering
you
do
think
of
me
except
as
my
father
executor
did
you
know
that
he
wanted
you
to
do
this
or
did
you
only
think
it
was
it
really
his
express
wish
he
looked
her
in
the
face
and
lied
boldly
and
freely
it
was
absolutely
and
as
she
met
that
look
so
luminously
so
superlatively
sincere
she
knew
that
he
had
lied
all
the
same
said
she
i
ca
take
it
do
think
it
unfriendly
of
me
it
is
in
fact
do
you
see
just
because
we
have
been
we
are
friends
that
i
must
refuse
it
i
ca
take
advantage
of
that
she
was
going
to
say
feeling
but
thought
better
of
it
and
do
you
see
by
refusing
you
are
compelling
me
to
be
dishonourable
if
you
were
really
my
friend
you
would
think
more
of
my
honour
than
of
your
own
scruples
or
is
that
asking
too
much
he
felt
that
he
had
scored
in
this
game
of
keen
intelligences
no
but
it
would
be
wrong
of
me
to
let
your
honour
be
influenced
by
our
friendship
do
think
of
our
friendship
then
it
all
pure
business
as
brutally
impersonal
as
you
like
if
i
could
only
see
it
that
way
i
should
have
thought
it
was
quite
transparently
and
innocently
clear
he
had
scored
again
for
now
he
had
taxed
her
with
stupidity
if
i
could
persuade
you
that
it
came
from
my
father
you
mind
you
mind
because
you
think
it
comes
from
me
is
that
so
she
was
silent
and
he
knew
how
can
i
persuade
you
i
can
only
repeat
that
i
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
it
there
was
but
little
friendliness
about
him
now
his
whole
manner
was
full
of
weariness
and
irritation
why
should
you
imagine
that
i
had
because
it
would
have
been
so
very
like
you
then
i
must
be
lying
abominably
is
that
so
very
like
me
i
have
heard
you
do
it
before
once
twice
magnificently
when
about
this
time
nine
years
ago
he
remembered
the
wonder
was
that
she
should
have
remembered
too
i
daresay
but
what
possible
motive
could
i
have
for
lying
now
he
had
scored
heavily
this
time
far
too
heavily
there
was
a
flame
in
lucia
face
which
did
not
come
from
the
glow
of
the
fire
a
flame
that
ran
over
her
neck
and
forehead
to
the
fine
tips
of
her
ears
for
she
thought
supposing
all
the
time
he
had
been
telling
her
the
simple
truth
why
should
she
have
raised
that
question
why
should
she
have
taken
for
granted
that
any
personal
interest
should
have
led
him
to
do
this
thing
and
in
wondering
she
was
ashamed
he
saw
her
confusion
and
attributed
it
to
another
cause
i
only
asking
you
to
keep
the
two
things
distinct
as
i
do
as
i
must
do
he
said
gently
i
think
about
it
and
let
you
know
but
i
going
oh
no
i
ca
let
you
do
that
you
must
stay
over
the
night
your
room
is
ready
for
you
he
protested
she
insisted
and
in
the
end
she
had
her
way
as
he
meant
to
have
his
way
he
stayed
and
all
that
evening
they
were
very
kind
to
him
kitty
talked
gaily
throughout
dinner
and
afterwards
lucia
played
to
him
while
he
rested
propped
up
with
great
cushions
she
had
insisted
on
the
cushions
in
her
chair
kitty
his
hostess
drew
back
and
seemed
to
leave
these
things
to
lucia
as
her
right
he
knew
it
was
lucia
and
not
kitty
who
ran
up
to
his
room
to
see
that
all
was
comfortable
and
that
his
fire
burnt
well
in
everything
she
said
and
did
there
was
a
peculiar
gentleness
and
care
it
was
on
the
same
lines
as
compassion
only
more
poignant
and
intense
it
was
he
thought
as
if
she
knew
that
it
was
for
the
last
time
that
of
all
these
pleasant
things
would
see
the
end
was
it
kind
of
her
to
let
him
know
what
her
tenderness
could
be
when
must
end
it
all
for
he
had
no
notion
of
the
fear
evoked
by
his
appearance
the
fear
that
was
in
both
their
hearts
he
did
not
know
why
they
looked
at
him
with
those
kind
glances
nor
why
lucia
told
him
that
robert
was
close
at
hand
if
he
should
want
anything
in
the
night
he
slept
in
the
room
that
had
once
been
lucia
the
room
above
the
library
looking
to
the
western
hills
he
did
not
know
that
they
had
given
it
him
because
it
was
a
good
room
to
be
ill
and
to
get
well
in
lucia
and
kitty
sat
up
late
that
night
over
the
fire
and
they
talked
of
him
kitty
began
it
you
remember
said
she
the
things
we
used
to
say
about
him
oh
do
kitty
i
do
you
need
mind
it
was
only
i
who
said
them
yes
you
said
them
but
i
thought
them
then
she
told
kitty
what
had
brought
him
there
and
the
story
that
he
had
told
her
and
kitty
all
the
time
i
knew
he
lied
probably
you
must
take
it
lucy
all
the
same
how
can
i
take
it
when
i
know
it
comes
out
of
his
own
poor
little
waistcoat
pocket
you
would
if
you
cared
enough
about
him
no
it
just
i
care
that
i
ca
you
do
care
then
yes
of
course
i
do
but
not
in
the
same
way
as
cares
lucy
kitty
words
sounded
like
a
statement
rather
than
a
question
so
they
passed
unanswered
it
all
right
kitty
it
all
over
at
last
he
does
care
a
bit
now
not
a
bit
oh
does
he
how
can
you
be
so
idiotic
all
over
i
assure
you
only
just
begun
lucia
turned
her
head
away
lucy
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
lucia
smiled
sadly
that
was
the
question
she
had
asked
horace
ten
years
ago
making
him
responsible
and
now
the
responsibility
had
been
laid
on
her
kitty
did
you
notice
how
thin
he
is
he
looks
as
if
he
just
come
through
some
awful
illness
but
i
ca
ask
him
about
it
rather
not
you
do
know
whether
he
had
it
or
whether
he
going
to
have
it
i
wonder
if
you
mind
asking
him
to
stay
a
week
or
two
it
might
help
him
to
get
strong
i
doubt
it
i
do
i
think
it
just
what
he
wants
oh
kitty
could
you
would
you
if
i
wanted
it
too
you
need
ask
but
what
earthly
good
can
it
do
if
he
got
strong
here
it
would
be
so
nice
to
think
we
sent
him
away
well
and
if
he
going
to
be
ill
i
could
look
after
him
her
use
of
we
and
i
did
not
pass
unnoticed
by
the
observant
kitty
and
then
lucia
face
which
had
been
overcast
with
care
was
now
radiant
then
i
should
have
done
something
for
him
besides
making
him
miserable
will
you
ask
him
kitty
you
a
fool
lucy
and
i
another
but
i
ask
him
though
not
she
waited
to
see
what
would
bring
forth
for
she
was
certain
it
would
bring
forth
something
it
brought
forth
glorious
weather
after
the
east
wind
a
warm
languid
day
half
spring
half
summer
lucia
and
kitty
seemed
bent
on
putting
all
idea
of
business
out
of
their
guest
head
in
the
morning
they
drove
about
the
country
in
the
afternoon
they
all
sat
out
in
the
south
square
under
the
windows
of
the
while
lucia
talked
to
him
about
his
tragedies
kitty
still
held
her
invitation
in
reserve
at
last
she
left
them
to
themselves
it
was
lucia
who
first
returned
to
the
subject
of
dispute
she
had
some
sewing
in
her
lap
which
gave
her
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
talk
in
a
calm
detached
manner
and
without
looking
up
he
sat
near
her
watching
with
delight
the
quiet
movements
of
her
hands
i
been
thinking
over
what
you
said
yesterday
said
she
i
do
what
you
want
but
i
can
suggest
a
compromise
you
seem
determined
on
restitution
have
you
forgotten
that
you
once
offered
it
me
in
another
form
you
refused
it
in
that
form
then
i
would
refuse
it
now
if
you
could
be
content
with
that
do
you
remember
why
you
refused
it
she
did
not
answer
but
a
faint
flush
told
him
that
she
had
not
forgotten
the
same
objection
the
same
reason
for
objecting
holds
good
now
not
quite
i
should
not
be
wronging
any
one
else
you
mean
the
beaver
who
dotes
upon
immortal
verse
she
smiled
a
little
sadly
yes
there
no
beaver
in
the
question
now
you
shall
have
the
sonnets
in
any
case
i
brought
them
for
you
in
place
of
the
and
the
neapolitan
horace
and
she
lay
back
in
her
chair
and
closed
her
eyes
as
if
she
could
shut
out
sound
with
sight
please
please
if
you
go
on
talking
about
it
we
shall
both
be
very
tired
do
you
feel
as
if
you
like
some
tea
she
was
bringing
out
all
her
feminine
reserves
to
conquer
him
but
he
was
not
going
to
be
conquered
this
time
he
could
afford
to
wait
for
he
also
had
reserves
i
so
sorry
he
said
humbly
i
wo
bore
you
any
more
till
after
tea
and
lucia
knew
it
was
an
armistice
only
and
not
peace
at
kitty
perceived
that
the
moment
was
not
yet
propitious
for
her
invitation
she
was
not
even
sure
that
it
would
ever
come
nor
would
it
for
rickman
knew
that
his
only
chance
lay
in
their
imminent
parting
in
the
last
hour
that
must
be
his
he
was
counting
on
it
when
the
steady
resistless
flow
of
a
stream
of
callers
cut
short
his
calculations
it
flowed
between
him
and
lucia
they
could
only
exchange
amused
or
helpless
glances
across
it
now
and
then
at
last
he
found
a
moment
and
approached
her
i
wanted
to
give
you
those
things
before
i
go
very
well
we
go
into
the
house
in
one
minute
he
waited
she
made
a
sign
that
said
come
and
he
followed
her
she
avoided
the
that
looked
on
the
courtyard
with
its
throng
of
callers
hesitated
and
opened
the
door
into
the
library
he
ran
upstairs
to
fetch
the
manuscript
and
joined
her
there
but
for
the
empty
bookshelves
this
room
too
was
as
he
had
left
it
lucia
was
sitting
in
a
window
seat
he
came
to
her
and
gave
the
poems
into
her
open
hands
and
she
thanked
him
nonsense
it
good
of
you
to
take
them
but
that
does
release
you
from
your
obligations
she
laid
the
manuscript
on
the
protected
by
her
hand
he
sat
there
facing
her
and
for
a
moment
neither
spoke
i
have
very
much
time
he
said
at
last
i
got
to
catch
the
you
have
we
do
want
you
to
go
like
this
now
you
here
you
must
stay
a
fortnight
at
the
very
least
he
hung
his
head
he
did
not
want
her
to
see
how
immense
was
the
temptation
he
murmured
some
agitated
thanks
but
his
refusal
was
made
quite
plain
he
could
not
give
up
the
advantage
he
had
counted
on
i
afraid
i
must
bore
you
again
a
little
now
only
got
an
hour
do
spoil
it
then
see
how
beautiful
it
is
she
rose
and
threw
open
the
lattice
and
they
stood
together
for
a
moment
looking
out
it
was
about
an
hour
before
sunset
an
april
sunset
the
golden
consummation
of
the
wedding
of
heaven
and
earth
he
felt
a
delicate
vibration
in
the
air
the
last
tender
resonance
of
the
nuptial
song
this
april
was
not
the
april
of
the
streets
where
the
great
wooing
of
the
world
goes
on
with
violence
and
clangour
for
the
city
is
earth
turned
to
stone
and
yields
herself
struggling
and
unwilling
to
the
invasion
of
the
sky
here
all
the
beautiful
land
lay
still
breathless
in
her
escape
from
the
wind
to
the
sun
up
the
western
valley
the
earth
gave
all
her
greenness
naked
to
the
light
but
the
hills
were
dim
with
the
divine
approaches
of
her
mystical
union
washed
by
the
undivided
streams
of
blue
and
purple
air
that
flowed
to
the
thin
spiritual
verge
where
earth
is
caught
up
and
withdrawn
behind
heaven
inmost
veil
the
hour
was
beautiful
as
she
had
said
its
beauty
had
clothed
itself
with
immortality
in
light
yet
there
was
in
it
such
mortal
tenderness
as
drew
his
heart
after
it
and
melted
his
will
in
longing
he
turned
from
the
window
and
looked
at
her
with
all
his
trouble
in
his
eyes
lucia
saw
that
her
words
had
saddened
him
and
she
sat
still
devising
some
comfort
for
him
in
her
heart
i
do
think
he
said
at
last
you
quite
know
what
you
are
doing
i
going
to
tell
you
something
that
i
did
mean
to
tell
you
when
i
said
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
all
this
it
was
altogether
true
so
i
supposed
she
murmured
there
was
a
a
certain
amount
of
trouble
and
difficulty
about
it
and
what
did
that
mean
it
only
meant
that
i
had
to
work
rather
hard
to
put
it
right
i
liked
it
so
you
need
think
anything
of
that
but
if
you
persist
in
your
refusal
all
my
hard
work
goes
for
nothing
he
was
so
powerless
against
her
tender
obstinacy
that
he
had
determined
to
appeal
to
her
tenderness
alone
there
were
about
three
years
of
it
the
best
three
years
out
of
my
life
and
you
are
going
to
fling
them
away
and
make
them
useless
all
for
a
little
wretched
scruple
this
is
the
only
argument
that
will
appeal
to
you
or
i
would
have
mentioned
it
the
best
years
out
of
your
life
why
were
they
the
best
because
they
were
the
first
in
which
i
was
free
she
thought
of
the
time
nine
years
ago
when
she
had
taken
from
him
three
days
the
only
days
when
he
was
free
and
how
she
had
tried
to
make
restitution
and
had
failed
and
whatever
else
i
refuse
she
said
i
taken
i
ca
get
out
of
that
no
if
you
want
to
be
very
cruel
you
can
say
i
no
business
to
lay
you
under
the
obligation
but
you
ca
get
out
of
it
she
looked
away
did
she
want
to
be
very
cruel
did
she
want
to
get
out
of
it
might
it
not
rather
be
happiness
to
be
in
it
immersed
in
it
lost
in
it
with
all
her
scruples
and
all
her
pride
his
voice
broke
and
trembled
into
passion
and
what
is
it
that
asking
you
to
take
something
that
is
mine
and
yours
something
that
it
would
be
dishonourable
of
me
to
keep
but
if
it
mine
it
would
be
a
little
thing
compared
with
what
i
wanted
to
give
you
and
you
would
have
her
hands
in
her
distress
had
fallen
to
their
old
unconscious
trick
of
stroking
and
caressing
the
thing
they
held
the
one
thing
that
he
had
given
her
that
she
had
not
refused
his
eyes
followed
her
movements
she
looked
up
and
saw
the
jealous
hunger
in
them
she
saw
too
through
his
loose
thin
suit
that
the
lines
of
his
body
were
sharper
than
ever
his
face
was
more
than
ever
serious
and
clean
cut
his
eyes
were
more
than
ever
sunk
under
the
shadow
of
his
brows
darkening
their
blue
he
was
refined
almost
to
emaciation
and
she
saw
other
things
as
he
sat
there
with
one
leg
crooked
over
the
other
his
wrists
stretched
out
his
hands
clasped
nursing
his
knee
she
noticed
that
his
cuffs
though
clean
were
frayed
that
his
coat
was
worn
in
places
that
his
boots
were
patched
and
broken
at
the
sole
he
changed
his
attitude
suddenly
when
he
became
aware
of
her
gaze
she
did
not
know
why
she
had
not
noticed
these
details
before
nor
why
she
noticed
them
now
perhaps
she
would
not
have
seen
them
but
for
that
attempt
to
hide
them
which
revealed
their
significance
she
said
to
herself
he
is
poor
and
yet
he
has
done
this
and
the
love
that
had
been
so
long
hidden
sheltered
and
protected
by
her
pity
came
forth
and
knew
itself
as
love
and
she
forgot
his
greatness
and
remembered
only
those
pitiful
human
things
in
which
he
had
need
of
her
so
she
surrendered
i
will
take
everything
on
one
condition
that
you
will
give
me
what
you
said
just
now
i
would
have
the
eyes
that
she
lifted
to
his
were
full
of
tears
for
one
moment
he
did
not
understand
very
slowly
he
realized
that
the
thing
he
had
dreamed
and
despaired
of
that
he
dared
not
ask
for
was
being
divinely
offered
to
him
as
a
free
gift
there
was
no
moment
not
even
in
that
night
of
his
madness
in
this
room
nine
years
ago
nor
in
that
other
night
in
howland
street
when
he
had
desired
it
as
he
desired
it
now
her
tears
hung
curved
on
the
curved
lashes
of
her
eyes
and
spilt
themselves
and
fell
one
by
one
on
to
the
pages
of
the
manuscript
he
heard
them
fall
before
he
let
himself
be
carried
away
by
the
sweep
of
her
impulse
and
his
own
passion
he
saw
that
not
honour
but
common
decency
forbade
him
to
take
advantage
of
a
moment
inspired
tenderness
he
had
already
made
a
slight
appeal
but
that
was
for
her
sake
not
his
own
he
realized
most
completely
his
impossible
position
he
had
no
income
and
he
had
damaged
his
health
so
seriously
that
it
might
be
long
enough
before
he
could
make
one
and
these
facts
he
could
not
possibly
mention
she
suspected
him
of
poverty
but
the
smallest
hint
of
his
real
state
would
have
roused
her
infallible
instinct
of
divination
he
had
felt
as
her
eyes
rested
on
his
emaciated
body
that
they
could
see
the
course
of
its
sufferings
its
starvation
he
meant
that
she
should
never
know
what
things
had
happened
to
him
in
howland
street
his
chivalry
revolted
against
the
brutality
of
capturing
her
tender
heart
by
such
a
lacerating
haul
on
its
compassion
all
this
swept
through
him
between
the
falling
of
her
ears
last
of
all
came
the
thought
of
what
he
was
giving
up
was
it
possible
that
she
cared
for
him
it
could
not
be
the
illusion
lasted
only
for
an
instant
yet
while
it
lasted
the
insane
longing
seized
him
to
take
her
at
her
word
and
risk
the
consequences
for
she
would
find
out
afterwards
that
she
had
never
loved
him
and
she
would
disguise
her
feeling
and
he
would
see
through
her
disguise
he
would
know
there
could
never
be
any
disguise
any
illusion
between
her
and
him
but
at
least
he
could
take
her
in
his
arms
and
hold
her
now
while
her
tears
fell
she
would
be
his
for
this
moment
that
was
now
he
searched
her
face
to
see
if
indeed
there
had
been
any
illusion
through
the
tears
that
veiled
her
eyes
he
could
not
see
whether
it
were
love
or
pity
that
still
shone
in
them
but
because
of
the
tears
he
thought
it
must
be
pity
she
went
on
you
said
i
had
taken
the
best
years
of
your
life
i
would
like
to
give
you
all
mine
instead
such
as
it
is
if
take
it
she
said
it
quietly
so
quietly
that
he
thought
that
she
had
spoken
so
only
because
she
did
not
love
him
how
can
i
take
it
now
in
this
way
her
tears
stopped
falling
suddenly
i
admit
that
i
made
a
gross
appeal
to
your
pity
my
pity
yes
your
pity
his
words
were
curt
and
hard
because
of
the
terrible
restraint
he
had
to
put
upon
himself
i
did
it
because
it
was
the
best
argument
otherwise
it
would
have
been
abominable
of
me
to
have
said
those
things
i
was
thinking
of
anything
you
said
only
of
what
you
done
i
have
done
much
but
tell
me
the
truth
whether
would
you
rather
i
had
done
it
for
your
sake
or
for
mere
honour
sake
i
would
rather
you
had
done
it
for
honour
sake
she
said
it
out
bravely
though
she
knew
that
it
was
the
profounder
confession
of
her
feeling
he
however
was
unable
to
take
it
that
way
i
thought
so
he
said
well
that
why
i
did
it
i
see
i
wanted
to
know
the
truth
and
now
i
know
it
you
do
know
half
of
it
his
passion
leapt
to
his
tongue
under
the
torture
but
he
held
it
down
he
paused
knowing
that
this
moment
in
which
he
stood
was
one
of
those
moments
which
have
the
spirit
and
the
power
of
eternity
and
that
it
was
his
to
save
or
to
destroy
it
so
admirable
indeed
was
his
control
that
it
had
taken
their
own
significance
from
his
words
and
she
read
into
them
another
meaning
her
face
was
white
with
terror
because
of
the
thing
she
had
said
but
she
still
looked
at
him
without
flinching
she
hardly
realized
that
he
was
going
that
he
was
trying
to
say
i
will
take
the
books
if
you
can
keep
them
for
me
a
little
while
some
perfect
instinct
told
her
that
this
was
the
only
way
of
atonement
for
her
error
he
thanked
her
as
if
they
had
been
speaking
of
a
trifling
thing
she
rose
holding
the
manuscript
loosely
in
her
clasped
hands
and
he
half
thought
that
she
was
going
to
give
it
back
to
him
he
took
it
from
her
and
threw
it
on
the
and
held
her
hands
together
for
an
instant
in
his
own
he
looked
down
at
them
longing
to
stoop
and
kiss
them
but
forebore
because
of
his
great
love
for
her
and
let
them
go
he
went
out
quickly
he
had
sufficient
to
find
kitty
and
thank
her
and
take
his
leave
as
the
door
closed
on
him
lucia
heard
herself
calling
him
back
with
what
intention
she
hardly
knew
unless
it
were
to
return
his
poems
keith
she
said
softly
keith
but
even
to
her
own
senses
it
was
less
a
name
than
a
sound
that
began
in
a
sob
and
ended
in
a
sigh
kitty
found
her
standing
in
the
where
he
had
left
her
has
anything
happened
she
asked
i
asked
him
to
marry
me
kitty
and
he
would
that
was
all
are
you
sure
you
did
dear
from
the
look
of
him
i
should
have
said
it
was
the
other
way
about
chapter
lxxv
i
do
know
what
to
think
of
it
kitty
what
do
you
think
i
think
you
been
playing
with
fire
dear
with
the
divine
fire
it
the
most
dangerous
of
all
and
you
got
your
little
fingers
burnt
like
horace
he
once
said
the
burnt
critic
dreads
the
divine
fire
i
not
a
critic
that
you
most
certainly
are
not
still
i
used
to
understand
him
and
now
i
ca
i
ca
make
it
out
at
all
there
only
one
thing
said
kitty
musing
till
an
inspiration
came
you
have
seen
him
for
more
than
three
years
and
you
ca
tell
what
may
have
happened
in
between
he
have
got
entangled
with
another
woman
kitty
would
not
have
hazarded
this
conjecture
if
she
had
not
believed
it
plausible
but
she
dwelt
on
it
with
a
beneficent
intention
no
other
theory
she
opined
would
so
effectually
turn
and
rout
the
invading
idea
of
keith
rickman
kitty
was
for
once
mistaken
in
her
judgement
not
having
all
the
evidence
before
her
the
details
which
would
have
thrown
light
on
the
situation
were
just
those
which
lucia
preferred
to
keep
to
herself
all
that
the
benevolent
kitty
had
achieved
was
to
fill
her
mind
with
a
new
torment
lucia
had
dreaded
rickman
coming
she
had
lost
all
sense
of
security
in
his
presence
still
she
had
understood
him
and
now
she
felt
that
her
very
understanding
was
at
fault
that
something
troubled
the
fine
light
she
had
always
viewed
him
in
was
it
possible
that
she
had
never
really
understood
close
upon
kitty
words
there
came
back
to
her
the
tilings
that
edith
had
said
of
him
that
horace
had
hinted
things
that
he
had
confessed
to
her
himself
was
it
possible
that
he
was
still
that
sort
of
man
the
sort
that
she
had
vowed
she
would
never
marry
he
was
not
bad
she
could
not
think
of
him
as
bad
but
was
he
good
was
he
like
her
cousin
horace
no
certainly
there
was
not
the
smallest
resemblance
between
him
and
horace
with
horace
she
had
always
felt
in
one
way
absolutely
secure
if
she
had
ever
been
uncertain
it
had
not
been
with
this
obscure
inexplicable
dread
how
was
it
that
she
had
never
felt
it
before
never
felt
it
in
the
first
weeks
of
their
acquaintance
when
day
after
day
and
evening
after
evening
she
had
sat
working
with
him
here
alone
when
he
had
appeared
to
her
in
the
first
flush
of
his
exuberant
youth
transparent
as
glass
incapable
of
reservation
or
disguise
it
was
in
those
days
he
had
told
her
that
he
had
not
been
good
and
yet
her
own
vision
of
him
had
never
been
purer
her
divination
subtler
than
then
even
in
that
last
week
after
her
terrible
enlightenment
at
cannes
when
she
was
ready
to
suspect
every
man
even
horace
she
had
never
suspected
him
and
in
the
second
period
of
their
friendship
when
his
character
was
ripened
and
when
she
had
lived
under
the
same
roof
with
him
she
had
never
had
a
misgiving
or
a
doubt
and
now
there
was
no
end
to
her
doubt
she
could
not
tell
which
was
the
instinct
she
should
trust
or
whether
she
were
better
able
to
judge
him
then
or
now
what
had
become
of
her
calm
and
lucid
insight
of
the
sympathy
in
which
they
had
once
stood
each
transparent
to
the
other
for
that
was
the
worst
of
it
that
he
no
longer
understood
her
and
that
she
had
given
him
cause
for
misunderstanding
this
thought
was
beginning
to
keep
her
awake
at
night
she
had
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
respect
her
any
more
he
had
his
ideas
of
what
a
woman
should
and
should
not
do
and
he
had
been
horrified
at
finding
her
so
like
and
oh
so
unlike
other
women
here
lucia
mood
rose
from
misery
to
anger
she
had
thought
him
finer
subtler
than
that
but
he
had
judged
her
as
he
judged
such
women
and
she
had
brought
that
judgement
on
herself
in
an
ecstasy
of
shame
she
recalled
the
various
episodes
of
their
acquaintance
from
the
time
when
she
had
first
engaged
him
to
work
for
her
against
his
will
to
the
present
intolerable
moment
there
rose
before
her
in
an
awful
vision
that
night
when
she
had
found
him
sleeping
in
the
library
when
she
had
stayed
and
risked
the
chances
of
his
waking
well
he
could
not
think
any
the
worse
of
her
for
that
because
he
had
not
waked
but
she
had
risked
it
the
more
she
thought
of
it
the
more
she
saw
what
she
had
risked
he
would
always
think
of
her
as
a
woman
who
did
risky
things
edith
had
said
she
had
put
herself
in
his
power
she
remembered
how
she
had
come
between
him
and
the
woman
whom
he
would
have
married
but
for
her
how
she
had
invited
him
to
sit
with
her
when
the
beaver
was
away
he
had
liked
it
but
he
must
have
had
his
own
opinion
of
her
all
the
same
that
was
another
of
the
risky
things
and
of
course
he
had
taken
advantage
of
it
that
was
the
very
worst
of
all
he
had
loved
her
in
his
way
she
had
been
one
of
a
series
flossie
had
come
before
her
and
before
flossie
all
that
was
fine
in
him
had
turned
against
flossie
because
of
the
feeling
she
inspired
and
it
had
turned
against
her
for
now
when
he
had
got
over
it
had
forgotten
that
he
had
ever
had
that
feeling
when
all
he
wanted
was
to
go
his
own
way
and
let
her
go
hers
she
had
tried
to
force
herself
upon
him
lucia
was
unaware
of
her
violent
distortion
of
the
facts
he
had
come
with
his
simple
honourable
desire
for
reparation
and
she
had
committed
unpardonable
blunder
she
had
mistaken
his
intentions
and
for
the
monument
and
crown
of
her
dishonour
she
lucia
harden
had
proposed
to
him
and
been
rejected
her
misery
endured
with
some
merciful
intermissions
for
three
weeks
then
horace
jewdwine
wrote
and
invited
himself
down
for
the
first
in
may
he
come
kitty
she
asked
wearily
of
course
he
can
dear
if
you
want
him
i
do
want
him
but
i
do
mind
his
coming
kitty
said
to
herself
he
has
an
inkling
edith
has
been
saying
things
and
it
has
brought
him
to
the
point
otherwise
she
could
not
account
for
such
an
abrupt
adventure
on
the
part
of
the
deliberate
horace
it
was
a
wednesday
and
he
proposed
to
come
on
friday
he
came
on
friday
kitty
observation
was
on
the
alert
but
it
could
detect
nothing
that
first
evening
beyond
a
marked
improvement
in
horace
jewdwine
with
lucia
he
was
sympathetic
deferential
charming
he
also
laid
himself
out
a
little
elaborately
to
be
agreeable
to
kitty
in
the
morning
he
approached
lucia
with
a
gift
brought
for
her
birthday
i
thought
said
lucia
he
had
forgotten
that
i
ever
had
a
birthday
it
was
an
early
copy
of
rickman
tragedy
triumph
of
just
published
his
keen
eyes
watched
her
handling
it
he
suspects
thought
kitty
and
he
testing
her
but
lucia
equanimity
survived
am
i
to
read
it
now
as
you
like
she
carried
the
book
up
to
her
own
room
and
did
not
appear
till
in
her
absence
horace
seemed
a
little
uneasy
but
he
went
on
making
himself
agreeable
to
kitty
he
must
be
pretty
desperate
thought
she
if
he
thinks
it
worth
while
apparently
he
did
think
it
worth
while
though
he
allowed
no
sign
of
desperation
to
appear
lucia
equally
discreet
avoided
ostentatious
privacy
they
sat
out
all
afternoon
under
the
beechtrees
while
she
read
flaunting
triumph
of
in
his
very
eyes
he
watched
every
movement
of
her
face
that
changed
as
it
were
to
the
cadence
of
the
verse
it
was
always
so
he
remembered
when
she
was
strongly
moved
at
last
she
finished
and
he
smiled
you
like
your
birthday
present
very
much
but
horace
he
has
done
what
you
said
was
impossible
anybody
would
have
said
it
was
impossible
modern
drama
in
blank
verse
you
know
yes
it
ought
to
have
been
all
wrong
but
because
he
both
a
great
poet
and
a
great
dramatist
it
all
right
you
see
look
she
said
pointing
to
a
passage
that
she
dared
not
read
those
are
human
voices
could
anything
be
simpler
and
more
natural
but
it
blank
verse
because
it
could
be
more
perfectly
expressed
in
prose
yes
yes
i
wonder
how
he
does
it
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
anybody
else
it
remains
impossible
if
it
ever
played
it
will
be
played
because
of
rickman
and
inimitable
technique
not
because
of
his
blank
verse
she
put
the
book
down
took
up
her
work
and
said
no
more
horace
seemed
to
have
found
his
answer
and
to
be
satisfied
a
fool
thought
kitty
but
he
shall
have
his
chance
so
she
left
them
alone
together
that
evening
but
jewdwine
was
very
far
from
being
satisfied
either
with
lucia
or
himself
lucia
had
refused
to
play
to
him
yesterday
because
she
had
a
headache
she
had
refused
to
walk
with
him
because
she
was
tired
and
she
would
not
sit
up
to
talk
to
him
because
she
had
another
headache
that
evening
he
had
all
but
succumbed
to
a
terrible
temptation
it
was
so
long
since
he
had
been
alone
with
lucia
and
there
was
something
in
her
face
her
dress
her
attitude
that
appealed
to
the
authority
on
æsthetics
he
found
himself
wondering
how
it
would
be
if
he
got
up
and
kissed
her
but
just
then
lucia
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
there
was
that
tired
look
in
her
face
which
he
had
come
to
dread
he
thought
better
of
it
if
he
had
kissed
her
his
sense
of
propriety
would
have
obliged
him
to
propose
to
her
and
marry
her
he
almost
wished
he
had
yielded
to
that
temptation
done
that
desperate
deed
it
would
have
at
least
settled
the
question
once
for
all
for
jewdwine
had
found
himself
a
third
time
at
the
turning
of
the
ways
he
knew
where
he
was
but
not
where
he
was
going
it
had
happened
with
jewdwine
as
it
had
with
isaac
rickman
as
it
happens
to
every
man
bent
on
serving
two
masters
he
had
forbidden
his
right
hand
all
knowledge
of
his
left
he
lived
in
two
separate
worlds
in
one
lit
by
the
high
pure
light
of
the
idea
he
stood
comparatively
alone
cheered
in
his
intellectual
solitude
by
the
enthusiasm
of
his
disciples
for
in
the
minds
of
a
few
innocent
young
men
horace
jewdwine
reputation
remained
immortal
and
these
made
a
point
of
visiting
the
master
in
his
house
at
hampstead
he
allowed
the
souls
of
these
innocent
young
men
to
appear
before
him
in
an
undress
for
them
he
still
kept
his
lamp
well
trimmed
handing
on
the
sacred
imperishable
flame
some
suffered
no
painful
disenchantment
for
their
pilgrimage
and
when
the
world
that
knew
jewdwine
imparted
to
them
its
wisdom
they
smiled
the
mystic
smile
of
the
initiated
but
many
had
become
shaken
in
their
faith
one
of
these
having
achieved
a
little
celebrity
without
as
he
discovered
to
his
immense
astonishment
any
public
assistance
from
the
master
had
gone
to
rickman
and
asked
him
diffidently
for
the
truth
about
jewdwine
rickman
had
assured
him
that
the
person
in
the
study
the
inspired
and
inspiring
person
with
the
superhuman
insight
who
knew
your
thoughts
before
you
had
time
to
round
your
sentence
the
person
who
in
that
sacred
incommunicable
privacy
had
praised
your
work
he
was
the
real
jewdwine
but
he
had
added
everybody
ca
afford
to
be
himself
and
this
had
been
jewdwine
own
confession
and
defence
but
now
he
had
gone
down
into
devonshire
as
rickman
had
once
gone
before
him
to
find
himself
he
had
returned
to
lucia
as
to
his
own
purer
soul
that
night
jewdwine
sat
up
face
to
face
with
himself
and
all
his
doubts
his
problem
being
far
more
complicated
than
before
three
years
ago
it
might
have
been
very
simply
stated
was
he
or
was
he
not
going
to
marry
his
cousin
lucia
but
now
while
personal
inclination
urged
him
to
marry
her
prudence
argued
that
he
would
do
better
to
marry
a
certain
cousin
of
fulcher
his
own
cousin
had
neither
money
nor
position
fulcher
cousin
had
both
once
married
to
miss
fulcher
he
could
buy
back
court
house
if
the
pallisers
would
give
it
up
the
cabinet
minister
cousin
was
in
love
with
him
whereas
he
was
well
aware
that
his
own
cousin
was
not
but
then
he
had
never
greatly
desired
her
to
be
so
jewdwine
had
neither
respect
nor
longing
for
miss
fulcher
passionate
love
to
his
fragile
temperament
there
was
something
infinitely
more
alluring
in
lucia
virginal
apathy
her
indifference
which
he
confused
with
her
innocence
fascinated
him
her
reluctance
was
as
a
challenge
to
his
languid
blood
he
was
equally
fascinated
by
her
indifference
to
the
income
and
position
that
were
his
he
admired
that
immaculate
purity
the
more
because
he
was
not
himself
in
these
ways
particularly
pure
he
loved
money
and
position
for
their
own
sakes
and
hated
himself
for
loving
them
he
would
have
liked
to
have
been
strong
enough
to
despise
these
things
as
lucia
had
always
despised
them
but
he
did
not
desire
that
she
should
go
on
despising
them
any
more
than
he
desired
that
her
indifference
should
survive
the
marriage
ceremony
he
pictured
with
satisfaction
her
gradual
yielding
to
the
modest
luxury
he
had
to
offer
her
just
as
he
pictured
the
exquisite
delaying
dawn
of
her
wifely
ardour
the
truth
was
he
had
lived
too
long
with
edith
the
instincts
of
his
nature
cried
out
as
far
as
anything
so
could
be
said
to
cry
out
in
the
most
refined
of
accents
for
a
wife
for
children
and
a
home
he
had
his
dreams
of
the
holy
faithful
spouse
a
spouse
with
great
eyes
and
tender
breast
fit
pillow
for
the
head
of
a
headachy
literary
man
lucia
had
eyes
and
of
her
tenderness
he
had
never
had
a
doubt
he
had
never
forgotten
that
hot
june
day
the
year
before
he
left
oxford
when
he
lay
in
the
hammock
in
the
green
garden
and
lucia
ministered
to
him
before
that
there
was
a
blessed
long
vacation
when
he
had
himself
into
a
nervous
breakdown
and
lucia
had
soothed
his
headaches
with
the
touch
of
her
gentle
hands
for
the
sake
of
that
touch
he
would
then
have
borne
the
worst
headache
man
ever
had
and
now
it
seemed
that
it
was
lucia
that
was
always
having
headaches
he
had
in
fact
begun
to
entertain
the
very
gravest
anxiety
about
her
health
her
face
and
figure
had
grown
thin
they
were
becoming
less
and
less
like
the
face
and
figure
of
the
ideal
spouse
poor
arms
offered
no
reliable
support
for
a
tired
man
to
his
annoyance
jewdwine
found
that
he
had
to
breakfast
alone
with
his
hostess
because
of
lucia
headache
lucia
does
seem
very
strong
he
said
to
kitty
sternly
as
if
it
had
been
kitty
fault
do
you
see
it
i
have
seen
it
for
some
considerable
time
she
wants
rousing
and
jewdwine
who
was
himself
feeling
the
need
of
exercise
roused
her
by
taking
her
for
a
walk
up
harcombe
hill
up
she
turned
a
white
face
to
him
smiling
sweetly
sat
down
on
the
hillside
and
bent
her
head
upon
her
knees
he
sat
beside
her
and
waited
for
her
recovery
with
punctilious
patience
his
face
wore
an
expression
of
agonized
concern
but
she
could
see
that
the
concern
was
not
there
altogether
on
her
account
do
be
frightened
horace
you
wo
have
to
carry
me
home
he
helped
her
to
her
feet
not
ungently
and
was
very
considerate
in
accommodating
his
pace
to
hers
and
in
reassuring
her
when
she
apologized
for
having
spoilt
his
morning
and
then
it
was
that
she
thought
of
keith
rickman
of
his
gentleness
and
his
innumerable
acts
of
kindness
and
of
care
and
she
said
to
herself
would
not
be
impatient
with
me
if
i
were
she
rested
in
her
room
that
afternoon
and
kitty
sat
with
her
kitty
could
not
stand
she
said
more
than
a
certain
amount
of
horace
jewdwine
lucia
she
asked
suddenly
if
horace
jewdwine
had
asked
you
to
marry
him
five
years
ago
would
you
have
had
him
i
do
know
i
do
really
know
he
a
good
man
you
mean
his
morals
are
irreproachable
it
quite
easy
to
have
irreproachable
morals
if
you
have
the
temperament
of
an
iceberg
that
has
never
broken
loose
from
its
pole
now
i
call
keith
rickman
a
saint
because
he
could
so
easily
have
been
the
other
thing
lucia
did
not
respond
and
kitty
left
her
kitty
question
had
set
her
thinking
would
she
have
married
horace
if
he
had
asked
her
five
years
ago
why
not
between
horace
and
her
there
was
the
bond
of
kindred
and
of
caste
he
was
a
scholar
he
had
or
he
once
had
a
beautiful
mind
full
of
noble
thoughts
of
the
kind
she
most
admired
with
horace
she
would
have
felt
safe
from
many
things
all
his
ideas
and
feelings
all
his
movements
could
be
relied
on
with
an
absolute
assurance
of
their
propriety
horace
would
never
do
or
say
anything
that
could
offend
her
feminine
taste
in
his
love
she
had
been
certain
there
would
never
be
anything
painful
passionate
disturbing
she
had
dreamed
of
a
love
which
should
be
a
great
calm
light
rather
than
a
flame
there
was
no
sort
of
flame
about
horace
horace
a
good
man
yes
that
is
to
say
he
was
a
moral
man
he
would
have
come
to
her
clean
in
body
and
in
soul
she
had
vowed
she
would
never
marry
a
certain
kind
of
man
and
yet
that
was
the
kind
of
man
keith
rickman
had
been
she
had
further
demanded
in
her
husband
the
finish
of
the
ages
who
was
more
finished
than
horace
who
more
consummately
irreproachably
refined
and
yet
her
heart
had
grown
more
tender
over
keith
rickman
and
his
solecisms
and
now
it
beat
faster
at
the
very
thought
of
him
after
horace
jewdwine
for
horace
coming
had
brought
her
understanding
of
keith
rickman
and
herself
she
knew
now
what
had
troubled
her
once
clear
vision
of
him
it
was
when
she
had
loved
him
least
that
she
had
divined
him
best
hers
was
not
the
facile
heart
that
believes
because
it
desires
it
desired
because
it
believed
and
now
it
doubted
because
its
belief
was
set
so
high
and
knowing
that
she
loved
him
she
thought
of
that
last
day
when
he
had
left
her
and
how
he
had
taken
her
hands
in
his
and
looked
at
them
and
she
remembered
and
wondered
and
had
hope
then
it
occurred
to
her
that
horace
would
be
leaving
early
the
next
morning
and
that
she
really
ought
to
go
down
to
the
and
talk
to
him
again
by
kitty
mercy
he
had
been
given
another
chance
he
was
softened
by
a
mood
of
valediction
mingled
with
remorse
he
was
even
inclined
to
be
a
little
sentimental
lucia
because
her
vision
was
indifferent
therefore
untroubled
could
not
but
perceive
the
change
in
him
his
manner
had
in
it
something
of
benediction
and
something
of
entreaty
his
spirit
brooded
over
caressed
and
flattered
hers
he
deplored
the
necessity
for
his
departure
ego
in
he
quoted
but
you
go
away
and
become
more
more
metropolitan
than
ever
ah
lucia
ca
you
leave
my
poor
rag
alone
do
you
really
think
so
badly
of
it
well
i
was
prouder
of
my
cousin
when
he
had
i
did
ask
you
what
you
thought
of
perhaps
i
not
very
proud
of
myself
i
do
suppose
it
satisfies
your
ambition
i
should
be
sorry
if
it
did
my
what
do
you
think
it
was
it
was
was
it
to
be
a
great
critic
it
depends
on
what
you
call
great
well
you
came
very
near
it
once
when
when
you
were
editor
of
he
smiled
sadly
the
editor
of
lucia
was
a
very
little
man
with
a
very
big
conceit
of
himself
i
admit
he
made
himself
pretty
conspicuous
so
does
every
leader
of
a
forlorn
hope
still
he
led
it
what
does
the
editor
of
lead
public
opinion
dear
he
has
although
you
might
think
it
considerable
power
lucia
was
silent
he
can
make
or
kill
a
reputation
in
hours
does
that
satisfy
your
ambition
yes
it
satisfies
my
ambition
but
it
does
satisfy
me
i
was
afraid
it
did
you
need
be
afraid
dear
for
you
know
perfectly
well
what
would
do
i
know
do
you
know
yourself
horace
yes
lucia
he
said
gently
after
ten
years
you
may
not
be
proud
of
your
cousin
i
used
to
be
proud
of
him
always
or
nearly
always
when
were
you
proud
of
him
when
he
was
himself
when
he
was
sincere
i
ought
to
be
very
proud
of
cousin
for
she
is
pitilessly
sincere
horace
it
is
so
dear
never
mind
you
need
be
proud
of
me
if
only
care
i
have
always
cared
or
is
it
nearly
always
well
nearly
always
you
right
i
insincere
i
was
insincere
when
i
said
you
need
be
proud
of
me
i
want
you
i
mean
you
to
be
do
you
mean
to
give
up
then
well
no
that
asking
rather
too
much
i
know
it
is
do
you
hate
it
so
much
lucia
i
wish
you
did
i
have
hated
it
so
much
horace
that
i
once
wished
i
had
been
a
rich
woman
that
you
might
be
she
was
going
to
say
an
honourable
man
what
wrong
with
it
it
a
better
paper
than
the
old
one
there
are
better
men
on
it
and
its
editor
a
better
man
is
he
yes
he
a
simpler
humbler
person
and
i
should
have
thought
more
possible
to
like
in
her
heart
lucia
admitted
that
it
was
so
there
was
a
charm
about
this
later
horace
jewdwine
which
was
wanting
in
that
high
spirit
that
had
essayed
to
move
the
earth
he
had
come
down
from
his
chilly
altitudes
to
mix
with
men
he
had
shed
the
superstition
of
omnipotence
he
was
aware
of
his
own
weakness
and
humanized
by
it
the
man
was
soiled
but
softened
by
his
traffic
with
the
world
there
was
moreover
an
indescribable
pathos
in
the
contrast
presented
by
the
remains
of
the
old
self
its
loftiness
its
lucidity
and
the
vulgarity
with
which
he
had
wrapped
it
round
jewdwine
intellectual
splendour
had
never
been
so
impressive
as
now
when
it
showed
thus
tarnished
and
obscured
at
any
rate
he
went
on
he
is
infinitely
less
absurd
he
knows
his
limitations
also
his
mistakes
he
tried
to
turn
the
republic
of
letters
into
a
limited
monarchy
now
he
has
surrendered
to
the
omnipotence
of
facts
you
mean
he
has
lowered
his
standard
my
dear
girl
what
am
i
to
do
with
my
standard
look
at
the
rabble
that
are
writing
i
ca
compare
tompkins
with
shakespeare
or
brown
with
sophocles
i
lucky
if
i
can
make
out
that
tompkins
has
surpassed
brown
this
year
as
brown
surpassed
tompkins
last
year
in
other
words
that
tompkins
has
surpassed
himself
and
so
you
go
on
looking
lower
and
lower
lucia
i
do
look
lower
i
look
closer
i
see
that
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
tompkins
after
all
i
find
subtler
and
subtler
shades
of
distinction
between
him
and
brown
i
become
more
just
more
discriminating
more
humane
i
know
how
fine
your
work
is
and
that
just
the
pity
of
it
you
might
have
been
a
great
critic
if
you
had
wasted
yourself
on
little
things
and
little
men
if
a
really
big
man
came
along
do
you
think
i
should
look
at
them
but
he
does
come
i
waited
for
him
ten
years
lucia
and
he
has
come
oh
horace
he
has
show
me
a
big
man
and
i
fall
down
and
worship
him
only
show
him
me
that
your
business
is
it
not
mine
still
i
can
show
you
one
not
very
far
off
in
fact
very
near
too
near
for
us
to
judge
him
perhaps
who
is
he
if
i
not
mistaken
he
a
sort
of
friend
of
yours
keith
rickman
oh
do
you
remember
the
day
we
first
talked
about
him
he
did
indeed
he
remembered
how
unwilling
he
had
been
to
talk
about
him
and
he
was
still
more
unwilling
now
he
wanted
and
lucia
knew
that
he
wanted
to
talk
about
himself
it
ten
years
ago
she
said
have
you
been
waiting
all
this
time
to
see
him
he
coloured
i
saw
him
before
you
did
lucia
i
saw
him
a
very
long
way
off
i
was
the
first
to
see
were
you
then
oh
horace
if
you
saw
all
those
years
ago
why
you
said
so
i
have
said
so
many
times
whom
have
you
said
it
to
to
you
for
one
to
every
one
i
think
who
knows
him
they
bear
me
out
the
people
who
know
him
what
was
the
good
of
that
you
should
have
said
it
to
the
people
who
do
know
him
to
the
world
you
mean
i
should
have
posed
as
a
prophet
i
mean
that
what
you
said
you
might
have
written
ah
scripta
it
is
safe
to
prophesy
remember
i
saw
him
a
very
long
way
off
nobody
had
a
notion
there
was
anybody
there
you
could
have
given
them
a
notion
i
could
the
world
lucia
is
not
like
you
or
me
it
has
no
imagination
it
would
have
seen
and
it
would
have
believed
i
should
have
been
a
voice
crying
in
the
wilderness
a
voice
and
nothing
behind
it
and
as
i
said
prophecy
is
a
dangerous
game
in
the
first
place
there
is
always
a
chance
that
your
prediction
may
be
wrong
and
the
world
my
dear
cousin
has
a
nasty
way
of
stoning
its
prophets
even
when
they
right
oh
i
thought
it
provided
them
with
bread
and
butter
plenty
of
butter
it
does
on
the
condition
that
they
shall
prophesy
buttery
things
when
it
comes
to
hard
things
if
they
ask
for
bread
the
world
retaliates
and
offers
them
a
stone
and
that
stone
i
need
not
tell
you
has
no
butter
on
it
i
see
you
were
afraid
you
have
the
courage
of
your
opinion
and
i
have
much
opinion
of
my
courage
i
own
to
being
afraid
afraid
to
do
your
duty
as
a
critic
and
as
a
friend
my
first
duty
is
to
the
public
public
not
to
my
friends
savage
keith
rickman
may
be
a
very
great
poet
i
think
he
is
but
if
my
public
does
want
to
hear
about
savage
keith
rickman
i
insist
on
their
hearing
can
i
no
horace
after
all
you
told
me
i
do
believe
you
can
mind
you
it
takes
courage
of
a
sort
to
own
it
i
to
admire
your
frankness
am
i
you
say
you
afraid
but
you
said
just
now
you
had
such
power
if
i
had
taken
your
advice
and
devoted
myself
to
the
rôle
of
vates
i
should
have
lost
my
power
nobody
would
have
listened
to
me
i
began
that
way
by
preaching
over
people
heads
the
was
a
pulpit
in
the
air
i
stood
in
that
pulpit
for
five
years
spouting
literary
transcendentalism
nobody
listened
when
i
condescended
to
come
down
and
talk
about
what
people
could
understand
then
everybody
listened
it
would
have
done
rickman
any
good
if
i
pestered
people
with
him
but
when
the
time
comes
i
shall
speak
out
i
daresay
when
the
time
comes
it
will
come
too
when
he
has
made
his
name
with
no
thanks
to
you
then
you
be
the
first
to
say
told
you
so
it
would
have
been
a
greater
thing
to
have
helped
him
when
he
needed
it
i
did
help
him
he
would
be
writing
now
if
it
was
for
me
do
you
see
much
of
him
not
much
it
is
my
fault
he
added
in
answer
to
her
reproachful
eyes
he
shut
himself
up
with
maddox
in
a
stuffy
little
house
at
ealing
does
that
mean
that
he
very
badly
off
well
no
i
should
say
so
he
got
an
editorship
but
he
the
sort
that
made
for
getting
on
in
many
things
he
is
a
fool
i
admire
his
folly
more
than
some
people
wisdom
from
the
look
in
lucia
eyes
jewdwine
was
aware
that
his
cousin
no
longer
adored
him
did
she
adore
rickman
you
a
little
hard
on
me
i
think
after
all
i
was
the
first
to
help
him
the
last
are
you
quite
sure
you
helped
him
how
do
you
know
you
did
hinder
him
you
kept
him
for
years
turning
out
inferior
work
for
you
when
he
might
have
been
giving
us
his
best
he
might
if
he
been
alive
to
do
it
i
only
thinking
of
what
you
might
have
done
the
sort
of
thing
you
done
for
other
people
fulcher
for
instance
jewdwine
blushed
as
he
had
never
blushed
before
he
was
not
given
to
that
form
of
you
said
just
now
you
could
either
kill
a
book
in
hours
or
make
it
did
you
say
immortal
i
might
have
said
i
could
keep
it
alive
another
hours
you
know
the
reputations
you
have
made
for
people
i
do
know
them
i
made
enough
of
them
to
know
the
reputations
i
made
will
not
last
the
only
kind
that
does
last
is
the
kind
that
makes
itself
do
you
seriously
suppose
a
man
like
rickman
needs
my
help
i
am
a
journalist
and
the
world
that
journalists
are
compelled
to
live
in
is
very
poor
and
small
he
in
another
place
altogether
i
could
dream
of
treating
him
as
i
treat
say
rankin
or
fulcher
the
best
service
i
could
do
him
was
to
leave
him
alone
to
keep
off
and
give
him
room
room
to
stand
in
no
room
to
grow
in
room
to
fight
in
room
to
measure
his
length
in
when
he
falls
if
you
like
rickman
length
will
cover
a
considerable
area
lucia
looked
at
her
cousin
with
genuine
admiration
how
clever
how
amazingly
clever
he
was
she
knew
and
he
knew
that
he
had
failed
in
generosity
to
rickman
that
he
had
been
a
more
than
cautious
critic
and
a
callous
friend
she
had
been
prepared
to
be
nice
to
him
if
they
had
kept
rickman
out
of
their
conversation
but
as
the
subject
had
arisen
she
had
meant
to
give
horace
a
terribly
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
she
had
meant
to
turn
him
inside
out
and
make
him
feel
very
mean
and
pitiful
and
small
and
somehow
it
had
come
off
instead
of
diminishing
as
he
should
have
done
horace
had
worked
himself
gradually
up
to
her
height
had
caught
flame
from
her
flame
and
now
he
was
consuming
her
with
her
own
fire
it
was
she
who
had
taken
the
view
most
degrading
to
the
man
she
admired
she
who
would
have
dragged
her
poet
down
to
earth
and
put
him
on
a
level
with
rankin
and
fulcher
and
such
people
horace
would
have
her
believe
that
his
own
outlook
was
the
clearer
and
more
heavenly
that
he
understood
rickman
better
that
he
saw
that
side
of
him
that
faced
eternity
his
humility
too
was
pathetic
and
disarmed
her
indignation
at
the
same
time
he
made
it
appear
that
this
was
a
lifting
of
the
veil
a
glimpse
of
the
true
jewdwine
the
soul
of
him
in
its
naked
simplicity
and
sincerity
and
she
was
left
uncertain
whether
it
were
not
so
even
so
she
said
gently
think
of
all
you
will
have
missed
missed
lucia
yes
missed
i
think
to
have
believed
in
any
one
greatness
the
greatness
of
a
great
poet
to
have
been
allowed
to
hold
in
your
hands
the
pure
priceless
thing
before
the
world
had
touched
it
to
have
seen
what
nobody
else
saw
to
feel
that
through
your
first
glorious
sight
of
him
he
belonged
to
you
as
he
never
could
belong
to
the
world
that
he
was
your
own
that
would
be
something
to
have
lived
for
it
would
be
greatness
of
a
kind
he
bowed
his
head
as
it
were
in
an
attitude
as
humble
and
reverent
as
her
own
and
yet
he
said
the
world
does
sometimes
see
its
poet
and
believe
in
him
it
does
when
he
works
miracles
someday
he
will
work
his
miracle
and
when
the
world
runs
after
him
you
will
follow
i
shall
not
be
very
far
behind
chapter
lxxvi
he
wondered
how
it
was
that
lucia
had
seen
what
he
could
not
see
as
far
as
he
understood
his
own
attitude
to
rickman
he
had
begun
by
being
uncertain
whether
he
saw
or
not
but
he
had
quite
honestly
desired
to
see
yet
he
had
not
seen
not
because
he
was
incapable
of
seeing
but
because
there
had
come
a
time
when
he
had
no
longer
desired
to
see
and
from
not
desiring
to
see
he
had
gone
on
till
he
had
ended
by
not
seeing
then
because
he
had
not
seen
he
had
persuaded
himself
that
there
was
nothing
to
see
and
now
in
that
last
sudden
flaming
of
lucia
ardour
he
saw
what
he
had
missed
they
parted
amicably
with
a
promise
on
lucia
part
that
she
would
stay
with
edith
in
the
summer
by
the
time
he
returned
to
town
he
was
very
sure
of
what
he
saw
it
had
become
a
platitude
to
say
that
keith
rickman
was
a
great
poet
after
the
publication
of
triumph
of
the
interesting
the
burning
question
was
whether
he
were
not
if
anything
a
greater
dramatist
by
the
time
lucia
came
to
hampstead
that
point
also
had
been
settled
when
the
play
had
been
actually
running
for
three
weeks
its
success
was
only
sufficient
to
establish
his
position
and
no
more
he
himself
required
no
more
but
his
friends
still
waited
anxiously
for
what
they
regarded
as
the
crucial
test
the
introduction
of
the
new
dramatist
to
a
picked
audience
in
paris
in
the
autumn
lucia
had
come
up
with
kitty
palliser
to
see
the
great
play
she
looked
wretchedly
withdrawn
as
far
as
possible
into
the
darkness
of
the
box
she
sat
through
the
tremendous
third
act
apparently
without
a
sign
of
interest
or
emotion
kitty
watched
her
anxiously
from
time
to
time
she
wondered
whether
she
were
or
overwrought
or
whether
she
had
expected
something
different
and
were
disappointed
with
keith
tragedy
kitty
herself
wept
openly
and
unashamed
but
to
lucia
who
knew
that
tragedy
by
heart
it
was
as
if
she
were
a
mere
spectator
of
a
life
she
herself
had
once
lived
passionately
and
profoundly
with
every
word
and
gesture
of
the
actors
she
felt
that
there
passed
from
her
possession
something
of
keith
rickman
genius
something
sacred
intangible
and
infinitely
dear
that
the
triumphant
movement
of
the
drama
swept
between
him
and
her
remorselessly
dividing
them
she
was
realizing
for
the
first
time
that
henceforth
he
would
belong
to
the
world
and
not
to
her
and
yet
the
reiterated
applause
sounded
to
her
absurd
and
meaningless
why
were
these
people
insisting
on
what
she
had
known
so
well
had
seen
so
long
beforehand
she
was
glad
that
horace
was
not
with
her
but
when
he
came
out
of
his
study
to
greet
them
on
their
return
she
turned
aside
into
the
room
and
called
him
to
her
it
was
then
that
she
triumphed
well
horace
he
has
worked
his
miracle
i
always
said
he
would
you
doubted
once
once
perhaps
lucia
but
now
like
you
i
believe
like
me
i
never
doubted
i
believed
without
a
miracle
she
leaned
against
the
and
he
saw
that
she
was
trembling
she
turned
to
him
a
face
white
with
trouble
and
anxiety
where
is
he
horace
he
still
with
maddox
you
need
worry
lucy
if
he
scores
a
success
like
this
in
paris
that
will
mean
magnificence
there
was
something
unspeakably
offensive
to
her
in
her
cousin
tone
he
did
not
perceive
the
disgust
in
her
averted
profile
he
puzzled
her
one
moment
he
seemed
to
be
worshipping
humbly
with
her
at
the
inner
shrine
the
next
he
forced
her
to
suspect
the
sincerity
of
his
conversion
she
could
see
that
now
his
spirit
bowed
basely
before
the
possibility
of
the
great
poet
material
success
you
meet
him
if
you
stay
till
next
week
lucy
he
be
dining
here
on
the
tenth
again
the
tone
the
manner
hurt
her
horace
could
not
conceal
his
pride
in
the
intimacy
he
had
once
repudiated
he
so
obviously
exulted
in
the
thought
that
some
of
rickman
celebrity
his
immortality
perhaps
must
through
that
intimacy
light
upon
him
for
her
own
part
she
felt
that
she
could
not
face
keith
rickman
and
his
celebrity
his
immortality
she
had
always
faced
but
his
celebrity
no
it
rose
up
before
her
crushing
the
tender
hope
that
still
grew
among
her
memories
she
said
to
herself
that
she
was
as
bad
as
horace
in
attaching
importance
to
it
she
was
so
sure
that
keith
would
attach
none
to
it
himself
yet
nothing
should
induce
her
to
stay
for
that
dinner
on
the
tenth
if
it
were
only
that
she
shrank
from
the
spectacle
of
horace
abasement
something
of
this
feeling
was
apparent
in
the
manner
of
her
refusal
and
jewdwine
caught
the
note
of
disaffection
he
was
not
sure
whether
he
still
loved
his
cousin
but
he
could
not
bear
that
his
should
thus
perish
through
her
bad
opinion
it
was
in
something
of
his
old
imperial
mood
that
he
approached
her
the
next
morning
with
the
proofs
of
his
great
article
on
keith
rickman
and
the
modern
drama
there
the
author
of
the
to
the
apostle
of
the
absolute
the
opponent
of
individualism
had
made
his
recantation
he
touched
with
melancholy
irony
on
the
rise
and
fall
of
schools
and
declared
as
rickman
had
declared
before
him
that
in
modern
art
what
we
have
to
reckon
with
is
the
man
himself
that
utterance
he
flattered
himself
was
not
unbecoming
in
the
critic
who
could
call
himself
keith
rickman
friend
for
rickman
had
been
his
discovery
in
the
beginning
only
he
had
lost
sight
of
him
in
between
he
was
immensely
solemn
over
it
i
think
that
is
what
i
should
have
said
yes
horace
it
is
what
you
should
have
said
long
ago
when
he
needed
it
but
not
now
he
turned
from
her
and
shut
himself
up
in
his
study
with
his
article
his
eulogy
of
rickman
he
had
had
pleasure
in
writing
it
but
the
reading
was
intolerable
pain
he
knew
that
lucia
saw
both
it
and
him
with
the
cold
eye
of
the
absolute
there
was
no
softening
no
condonement
in
her
gaze
and
none
in
his
bitter
judgement
of
himself
up
till
now
there
had
been
moments
in
which
he
persuaded
himself
that
he
was
justified
in
his
changes
of
attitude
if
his
conscience
joined
with
his
enemies
in
calling
him
a
what
did
it
mean
but
that
in
every
situation
he
had
served
his
time
he
had
grown
opulent
in
experience
espousing
all
the
fascinating
forms
of
truth
and
did
not
the
illuminated
the
supremely
philosophic
mood
consist
in
just
this
openness
this
receptivity
this
infinite
adaptability
in
short
why
should
he
any
more
than
rickman
be
bound
by
the
laws
laid
down
in
the
to
the
to
was
not
a
work
that
one
could
set
aside
with
any
levity
still
in
constructing
it
he
had
been
building
a
lighthouse
for
the
spirit
not
a
prison
but
now
he
became
the
prey
of
a
sharper
more
agonizing
insight
an
insight
that
oscillated
between
insufferable
forms
of
doubt
was
it
possible
that
he
the
author
of
the
had
ceased
to
care
about
the
truth
or
was
it
that
the
philosophy
of
the
absolute
had
never
taken
any
enormous
hold
on
him
he
had
desired
to
be
consistent
as
he
was
incorruptible
did
his
consistency
amount
to
this
that
he
the
incorruptible
had
been
from
first
to
last
the
slave
of
whatever
opinion
was
dominant
in
his
world
loyal
only
to
whatever
theory
best
served
his
own
ungovernable
egoism
in
oxford
he
had
cut
a
very
imposing
figure
by
his
philosophic
attitude
in
london
he
had
found
that
the
same
attitude
rendered
him
unusual
not
to
say
ridiculous
had
the
absolute
abandoned
him
or
had
he
abandoned
the
absolute
when
it
no
longer
ministered
to
his
personal
prestige
jewdwine
was
aware
that
however
it
was
his
case
exemplified
the
inevitable
collapse
of

nourished

upon

behind

there
remained
the
source
of
spiritual
illumination
the
inner
soul

judged

it
judged

immaterial
view
its

never

chapter
lxxvii
meanwhile
the
junior
journalists
found
amusement
in
discussing
whether
the
great
dramatist
were
maddox
discovery
or
jewdwine
with
the
readers
of
he
passed
as
jewdwine
which
was
all
that
jewdwine
wanted
with
the
earnest
aspiring
public
striving
to
admire
keith
rickman
because
they
had
been
told
they
ought
to
he
passed
as
their
own
the
few
who
had
known
him
from
the
first
knew
also
that
poets
like
rickman
are
never
discovered
until
they
discover
themselves
maddox
whom
much
worship
had
made
humble
gave
up
the
absurd
pretension
enough
that
he
lived
and
was
known
to
live
with
rickman
as
his
friend
they
shared
that
little
house
at
ealing
which
rickman
in
the
ardour
of
his
had
once
destined
for
the
young
delilah
his
bride
it
had
now
become
a
temple
in
which
maddox
served
with
all
the
religious
passion
of
his
soul
the
poet
had
trusted
the
honour
and
the
judgement
of
his
friend
so
far
as
to
appoint
him
his
literary
executor
thus
maddox
became
possessed
of
the
secret
of
the
sonnets
and
here
a
heavy
strain
was
put
upon
his
judgement
and
his
honour
maddox
had
guessed
that
there
was
a
power
in
rickman
life
more
terrible
than
jewdwine
who
after
all
had
never
really
touched
him
there
was
maddox
had
always
known
a
woman
somewhere
a
thousand
terrors
beset
the
devotee
when
he
noticed
that
since
fame
had
lighted
upon
rickman
the
divinity
had
again
begun
to
furnish
his
part
the
holy
part
of
the
temple
in
a
manner
unmistakably
suggestive
of
mortality
maddox
shuddered
as
he
thought
of
the
probable
destination
of
that
upper
chamber
which
was
the
holiest
of
all
and
now
this
terror
had
become
a
certainty
the
woman
existed
he
knew
her
name
she
was
a
cousin
of
the
detestable
jewdwine
the
sonnets
could
never
be
given
to
the
world
as
long
as
she
withheld
her
consent
and
apparently
she
did
withhold
it
more
than
this
had
not
been
revealed
to
maddox
and
it
was
in
vain
that
he
tried
to
penetrate
the
mystery
his
efforts
were
not
the
most
delicate
imaginable
one
evening
sitting
with
rickman
in
that
upper
chamber
he
entered
on
the
subject
thus
seen
anything
of
the
spinkses
lately
i
called
there
last
saturday
how
is
the
divine
flossie
flourishing
at
least
there
another
baby
by
the
way
maddy
you
were
grossly
wrong
about
her
there
the
beaver
is
absolutely
devoid
of
the
maternal
instinct
she
decent
to
the
baby
but
she
positively
brutal
to
muriel
maud
how
spinky
he
protests
and
there
are
horrid
scenes
but
through
them
all
i
believe
the
poor
chap
in
love
with
her
curious
illusion
curious
indeed
it
had
seemed
incredible
to
rickman
when
he
had
seen
the
beaver
pushing
her
from
her
knee
good
heavens
rickman
what
a
deliverance
for
you
i
wonder
if
he
happy
ca
say
but
possibly
he
holds
his
own
you
see
spinky
position
is
essentially
sound
my
theory
is
but
rickman
had
no
desire
for
a
theory
of
marriage
as
propounded
by
maddox
he
had
always
considered
that
in
these
matters
maddox
was
a
brute
maddox
drew
his
own
conclusions
from
the
disgusted
protest
he
remembered
how
once
when
he
had
warned
rickman
of
the
love
of
little
women
rickman
had
said
it
was
the
great
women
who
were
dangerous
the
lady
to
whom
he
had
entrusted
the
immortality
of
his
sonnets
would
be
one
of
these
as
the
guardian
of
that
immortality
maddox
conceived
it
was
his
duty
to
call
on
the
lady
and
prevail
on
her
to
give
them
up
under
all
his
loyalty
he
had
the
audacity
of
the
journalist
who
sticks
at
nothing
for
his
own
glorious
end
there
was
after
all
a
certain
simplicity
about
maddox
he
considered
himself
admirably
equipped
by
nature
for
this
delicate
mission
he
was
besides
familiar
with
what
he
called
the
society
woman
and
he
believed
that
he
knew
how
to
deal
with
her
maddox
always
had
the
air
of
being
able
to
push
his
way
anywhere
by
the
aid
of
his
mighty
shoulders
he
sent
in
his
card
without
a
misgiving
lucia
knew
that
maddox
was
a
friend
of
keith
rickman
and
she
received
him
with
a
courtesy
that
would
have
disarmed
a
man
less
singularly
determined
it
was
only
when
he
had
stated
his
extraordinary
purpose
that
her
manner
became
such
that
so
he
described
it
afterwards
it
would
have
set
a
worm
back
up
and
maddox
was
no
worm
it
was
a
little
while
before
lucia
realized
that
this
rather
overpowering
visitor
was
requesting
her
to
give
up
certain
sonnets
of
keith
rickman
written
in
i
do
quite
understand
are
you
asking
me
to
give
you
the
manuscript
or
to
give
my
consent
to
its
publication
well
both
i
to
ask
you
because
he
never
would
do
it
himself
why
should
he
not
oh
well
you
know
his
ridiculous
notions
of
honour
i
do
indeed
i
daresay
some
people
would
consider
them
ridiculous
it
was
this
speech
maddox
confessed
that
first
set
his
back
up
he
was
irritated
more
by
the
calm
assumption
of
proprietorship
in
rickman
than
by
the
implied
criticism
of
himself
do
you
mind
telling
me
she
continued
still
imperturbably
how
you
came
to
know
anything
about
it
maddox
stiffened
i
am
rickman
oldest
and
most
intimate
friend
and
he
has
done
me
the
honour
to
make
me
his
literary
executor
did
he
also
give
you
leave
to
settle
his
affairs
beforehand
maddox
shrugged
his
shoulders
by
way
of
a
reply
if
he
did
not
said
lucia
there
nothing
more
to
be
said
pardon
me
there
is
a
great
deal
more
to
be
said
i
do
know
whether
you
have
any
personal
reason
for
objecting
she
coloured
and
was
silent
if
it
pride
i
should
have
thought
most
women
would
have
been
prouder
a
look
from
lucia
warned
him
that
he
would
do
well
to
refrain
from
thinking
oh
well
for
all
i
know
you
might
have
fifty
good
reasons
the
question
is
are
you
justified
in
sacrificing
a
work
of
genius
to
any
mere
personal
feeling
he
had
her
there
and
she
knew
it
she
was
silently
considering
the
question
three
years
ago
she
would
have
had
no
personal
feeling
in
the
matter
beyond
pride
in
the
simple
dedication
now
that
personal
feeling
had
come
in
and
had
concentrated
itself
upon
that
work
of
genius
and
made
it
a
thing
so
sacred
and
so
dear
to
her
she
shrank
with
horror
from
the
vision
of
publicity
besides
it
was
all
of
keith
rickman
that
was
left
to
her
his
other
works
were
property
therefore
she
clung
the
more
desperately
to
that
one
which
as
he
had
said
belonged
to
nobody
but
her
and
maddox
had
no
right
to
question
her
instead
of
answering
him
she
moved
her
chair
a
little
farther
from
him
and
from
the
light
now
maddox
had
the
coldness
as
well
as
the
passion
of
the
celt
he
was
not
touched
by
lucia
beauty
nor
yet
by
the
signs
of
illness
or
fatigue
manifest
in
her
face
and
all
her
movements
her
manner
irritated
him
it
seemed
the
feminine
counterpart
of
her
insufferable
apathy
he
felt
helpless
before
her
immobility
but
he
meant
to
carry
his
point
by
brute
force
if
necessary
but
not
yet
i
not
asking
you
to
give
up
a
mere
copy
of
verses
the
sonnets
are
unique
even
for
rickman
and
for
one
solitary
lady
to
insist
on
suppressing
them
well
you
know
it
a
large
order
this
time
she
indeed
showed
some
signs
of
animation
how
do
you
know
they
are
unique
did
he
show
you
them
no
he
did
not
i
found
them
among
his
papers
when
he
was
in
hospital
in
hospital
she
sat
up
and
looked
at
him
steadily
and
without
emotion
yes
i
had
to
overhaul
his
things
we
thought
he
was
dying
and
the
sonnets
never
mind
the
sonnets
now
please
tell
me
about
his
illness
what
was
it
again
that
air
of
imperious
proprietorship
enteric
he
said
bluntly
and
some
other
things
where
was
he
before
they
took
him
to
the
hospital
he
was
if
you
want
to
know
in
a
garret
in
a
back
street
off
tottenham
court
road
what
was
he
doing
there
to
the
best
of
my
belief
he
was
starving
do
you
find
the
room
too
close
no
no
go
on
maddox
went
on
he
was
enjoying
the
sensation
he
was
creating
he
went
on
happily
piling
up
the
agony
since
she
would
have
it
he
was
not
reticent
of
detail
he
related
the
story
of
the
rankins
dinner
he
described
with
diabolically
graphic
touches
the
garret
in
howland
street
we
thought
he
been
drinking
you
know
and
all
the
time
he
was
starving
he
was
starving
she
repeated
slowly
to
herself
he
was
not
doing
it
because
he
was
a
poet
it
seems
he
had
to
pay
some
debt
or
thought
he
had
the
poor
chap
talked
about
it
when
he
was
delirious
oh
let
open
that
window
thank
you
you
say
he
was
delirious
were
you
with
him
then
maddox
leapt
to
his
conclusion
miss
lucia
harden
had
something
to
conceal
he
gathered
it
from
her
sudden
change
of
attitude
from
her
interrogation
from
her
faintness
and
from
the
throbbing
terror
in
her
voice
was
why
she
desired
the
suppression
of
the
sonnets
were
you
with
him
she
repeated
no
god
forgive
me
nobody
was
with
him
before
they
took
him
to
the
hospital
nobody
my
dear
lady
whom
you
would
call
anybody
he
owes
his
life
to
the
charity
of
a
drunken
prostitute
she
was
woman
the
eternal
predestined
enemy
of
rickman
genius
therefore
he
had
determined
not
to
spare
her
but
to
smite
her
with
words
like
and
to
judge
by
the
look
of
her
he
had
succeeded
she
had
turned
away
from
him
to
the
open
window
she
made
no
sign
of
suffering
but
for
the
troubled
rising
and
falling
of
her
breast
he
saw
in
her
a
woman
mortally
smitten
but
smitten
he
imagined
in
her
vanity
have
i
persuaded
you
he
said
quietly
to
give
up
those
sonnets
you
shall
have
a
copy
if
rickman
wants
the
original
he
must
come
for
it
himself
thanks
maddox
had
ceased
to
be
truculent
having
gained
his
end
his
blue
eyes
twinkled
with
their
old
infantile
devilry
thanks
awfully
nice
of
you
but
could
you
make
it
seem
a
little
more
spontaneous
you
see
i
do
want
rickman
to
know
i
had
to
ask
you
for
them
he
had
a
dim
perception
of
inconsistency
in
his
judgement
of
the
lady
since
all
along
he
had
been
trusting
her
generosity
to
shelter
his
indiscretion
lucia
smiled
even
in
her
anguish
that
i
can
well
imagine
the
copy
shall
be
sent
to
him
and
maddox
considered
himself
dismissed
he
wondered
why
she
called
him
back
to
ask
for
the
number
of
that
house
in
howland
street
that
afternoon
she
dragged
herself
there
that
she
might
torture
her
eyes
because
they
had
not
seen
and
her
heart
because
it
had
not
felt
chapter
lxxviii
at
jewdwine
heart
there
was
trouble
and
in
his
mind
perfect
peace
for
he
knew
his
own
mind
at
last
though
he
was
still
a
little
indefinite
as
to
the
exact
condition
of
his
heart
three
days
after
maddox
extraordinary
disclosures
lucia
had
become
most
obviously
and
inconsiderately
ill
and
had
given
her
cousin
edith
a
great
deal
of
trouble
as
well
as
a
severe
fright
till
kitty
also
frightened
had
carried
her
off
to
devonshire
out
of
the
house
of
the
jewdwines
to
horace
the
working
of
events
was
on
the
whole
beneficent
lucia
change
of
attitude
her
illness
her
abrupt
departure
though
too
unpleasant
for
his
fastidious
mind
to
dwell
upon
had
committed
that
mind
irretrievably
to
the
path
of
prudence
so
prudent
was
he
that
of
his
saner
matrimonial
project
the
world
in
general
took
no
note
secure
of
the
affections
of
miss
fulcher
he
had
propitiated
rumour
by
the
fiction
of
his
engagement
to
lucia
rumour
adding
a
touch
of
certainty
to
the
story
had
handed
it
on
to
rickman
by
way
of
maddox
and
miss
roots
he
there
upon
left
off
beautifying
his
house
at
ealing
and
agreed
with
maddox
that
after
paris
in
november
they
should
go
on
to
italy
together
and
that
he
would
winter
there
for
his
health
but
by
november
there
came
more
rumours
rumours
of
the
breaking
off
of
the
engagement
rumours
of
some
mysterious
illness
of
lucia
as
the
cause
they
reached
rickman
in
the
week
before
the
date
fixed
for
the
production
of
triumph
of
in
paris
he
was
paying
a
farewell
call
on
miss
roots
who
became
inscrutable
at
the
mention
of
lucia
name
he
accused
her
with
violence
of
keeping
the
truth
from
him
and
implored
her
with
pathos
to
tell
it
him
at
once
but
miss
roots
had
no
truth
no
certain
truth
to
tell
there
were
only
rumours
miss
roots
knew
nothing
but
that
lucia
had
been
lying
on
her
back
for
months
she
conjectured
that
possibly
there
might
be
something
the
matter
with
her
spine
her
mother
had
been
delicate
and
sir
frederick
well
the
less
said
about
sir
frederick
the
better
rickman
retreated
followed
by
miss
roots
as
for
an
engagement
she
was
not
aware
that
there
ever
had
been
one
there
was
once
she
admitted
downstairs
an
understanding
probably
misunderstood
he
had
better
ask
horace
jewdwine
straight
out
but
she
assured
him
from
the
doorstep
it
would
take
an
earthquake
to
get
the
truth
out
of
he
flung
himself
into
a
hansom
and
was
one
with
the
driver
in
imprecation
at
the
gradient
of
the
hill
the
delay
however
enabled
him
to
find
jewdwine
at
home
and
alone
he
was
aware
that
the
interview
presented
difficulties
but
none
deterred
him
jewdwine
questioned
as
to
his
engagement
betrayed
no
surprise
for
with
rickman
the
unusual
was
to
be
expected
he
might
not
have
condescended
to
answer
rickman
his
obscure
disciple
but
he
felt
that
some
concession
must
be
made
to
the
illustrious
dramatist
there
had
been
he
admitted
an
understanding
between
him
and
miss
harden
it
hardly
amounted
to
an
engagement
and
it
had
been
cancelled
on
the
score
of
health
of
health
the
compression
of
jewdwine
lips
intimated
that
the
great
poet
had
sinned
not
for
the
first
time
against
convention
she
ill
then
i
said
on
the
score
of
health
we
first
cousins
and
it
is
not
always
considered
advisable
i
see
then
that
all
over
at
any
rate
i
not
going
to
take
any
risks
rickman
pondered
that
saying
for
a
while
do
you
mean
you
not
going
to
let
her
take
any
risks
jewdwine
said
nothing
but
endeavoured
to
express
by
his
manner
a
certain
distaste
for
the
conversation
or
does
he
mean
thought
rickman
that
he
wo
risk
having
a
delicate
wife
on
his
hands
it
not
as
if
i
did
know
he
persisted
i
know
she
she
lies
on
her
back
and
ca
move
is
it
her
spine
no
or
her
heart
not
to
my
knowledge
is
it
something
worse
jewdwine
was
silent
and
in
the
silence
rickman
mind
wandered
free
among
all
imaginable
horrors
and
forebodings
at
last
out
of
the
silence
there
appeared
to
him
one
more
terrible
than
the
rest
he
saw
what
jewdwine
must
have
meant
he
gathered
it
not
from
anything
he
had
said
but
from
what
he
refused
to
say
from
the
sternness
of
his
face
from
his
hesitations
his
reserves
jewdwine
had
created
the
horror
for
him
as
vividly
as
if
he
had
shaped
it
into
words
you
need
tell
me
what
it
is
do
you
mind
telling
me
whether
curable
or
not
my
rickman
if
i
knew
why
you
are
asking
all
these
questions
they
must
seem
extraordinary
and
my
reason
for
asking
them
is
more
extraordinary
still
they
measured
each
other
with
their
eyes
then
i
think
said
jewdwine
quietly
i
must
ask
you
for
your
reason
the
reason
is
that
if
you
not
going
to
marry
her
i
am
that
said
jewdwine
is
by
no
means
certain
there
is
not
a
single
member
of
her
family
living
except
my
sister
and
myself
therefore
i
consider
myself
responsible
if
i
were
her
father
or
her
brother
i
would
not
give
my
consent
to
her
marrying
and
i
do
give
it
now
oh
and
why
not
for
many
reasons
those
that
applied
in
my
own
case
are
sufficient
you
only
said
there
was
a
risk
and
that
you
were
going
to
take
it
now
i
mean
to
take
it
you
see
those
fools
of
doctors
may
be
mistaken
but
whether
they
mistaken
or
not
i
shall
marry
her
just
the
same
the
risk
you
see
involves
her
happiness
and
judging
by
what
i
know
of
your
temperament
what
do
you
know
about
my
temperament
you
know
perfectly
well
what
i
know
about
it
i
know
you
do
approve
of
my
morals
i
do
altogether
blame
you
considering
that
since
i
knew
miss
harden
i
very
nearly
married
someone
else
my
code
is
so
different
from
yours
that
i
should
have
considered
marrying
that
woman
a
lapse
from
virtue
so
the
intention
may
count
against
me
if
you
like
look
here
rickman
that
is
not
altogether
what
i
mean
neither
of
us
is
fit
to
marry
miss
harden
and
have
given
her
up
he
said
it
with
the
sublime
assurance
of
jewdwine
the
moral
man
does
it
does
her
illness
make
all
that
difference
it
makes
none
to
me
oh
well
all
right
if
you
think
you
can
make
her
happy
my
dear
jewdwine
i
do
think
i
know
he
smiled
that
smile
that
jewdwine
had
seen
once
or
twice
before
it
may
be
arrogant
to
suppose
that
i
succeed
where
better
men
might
fail
still
he
rose
and
drew
himself
up
to
all
his
slender
height
in
some
impossible
things
i
have
succeeded
they
are
not
the
same
things
no
but
in
both
you
see
it
all
depends
upon
the
man
with
that
he
left
him
as
rickman
back
turned
on
him
jewdwine
perceived
his
own
final
error
as
once
before
in
judging
the
genius
he
had
reckoned
without
the
man
so
now
in
judging
the
man
he
had
reckoned
without
his
genius
this
horrid
truth
came
home
to
him
in
his
solitude
in
the
interminable
watches
of
the
night
jewdwine
acknowledged
himself
a
failure
and
a
failure
for
which
there
was
no
possible
excuse
he
had
had
every
conceivable
advantage
that
a
man
could
have
he
had
been
born
free
free
from
all
social
disabilities
free
from
pecuniary
embarrassment
free
from
the
passions
that
beset
ordinary
men
and
he
had
sold
himself
into
slavery
he
had
opinions
he
was
packed
full
of
opinions
valuable
opinions
but
he
had
never
had
the
courage
of
them
he
had
always
been
a
slave
to
other
people
opinions
rickman
had
been
born
in
slavery
and
he
had
freed
himself
when
rickman
stood
before
him
superb
in
his
he
had
felt
himself
conquered
by
this
man
whom
as
a
man
he
had
despised
rickman
errors
had
been
the
errors
of
one
who
risks
everything
who
never
deliberates
or
counts
the
cost
and
in
their
repeated
rivalries
he
had
won
because
he
had
risked
everything
when
he
jewdwine
had
lost
because
he
would
risk
nothing
he
had
lost
ever
since
the
beginning
he
had
meant
to
discover
this
great
genius
to
befriend
him
to
protect
him
with
his
praise
eventually
to
climb
on
his
shoulders
into
fame
and
he
had
not
discovered
him
and
as
for
climbing
on
his
shoulders
he
had
been
shaken
off
with
one
shrug
of
them
there
had
been
risk
in
passing
judgement
on
young
rickman
and
he
had
not
taken
the
risk
therefore
he
had
failed
as
a
critic
he
had
waited
to
found
an
incorruptible
review
it
had
been
a
risky
proceeding
and
he
had
not
taken
the
risk
his
paper
was
a
venal
paper
sold
like
himself
to
the
public
he
despised
of
all
that
had
ever
appeared
in
it
nothing
would
live
nothing
but
a
few
immortal
trifles
signed
he
had
failed
pretty
extensively
as
an
editor
last
of
all
he
had
wanted
to
marry
his
cousin
lucia
but
there
was
risk
in
marrying
her
and
he
would
not
take
the
risk
and
rickman
would
marry
her
he
had
failed
most
miserably
as
a
man
with
that
jewdwine
turned
on
his
pillow
and
consoled
himself
by
thinking
of
miss
fulcher
and
her
love
chapter
lxxix
lucia
had
been
lying
still
all
the
afternoon
on
her
couch
in
the
so
still
that
kitty
thought
she
had
been
sleeping
but
kitty
was
mistaken
kitty
it
past
five
is
it
yes
dear
a
quarter
past
it
be
all
over
by
this
time
do
you
think
he
be
very
terrible
no
dear
i
think
he
be
very
kind
and
very
gentle
not
if
he
thinks
i
shamming
he
wo
think
that
i
wish
he
could
said
kitty
to
herself
they
were
waiting
for
the
visit
of
sir
wilfrid
spence
the
harmouth
doctor
had
desired
a
higher
light
on
the
mysterious
illness
that
kept
lucia
lying
for
ever
on
her
back
it
might
have
been
explained
he
said
if
she
had
suffered
lately
some
deep
mental
or
moral
shock
but
lucia
had
not
confessed
to
either
and
in
the
absence
of
any
mental
cause
it
would
be
as
well
said
the
harmouth
doctor
to
look
for
a
physical
one
the
fear
at
the
back
of
the
harmouth
doctor
mind
was
sufficiently
revealed
by
his
choice
of
the
specialist
sir
wilfrid
spence
you
think
i
shamming
kitty
sometimes
i
think
i
am
and
sometimes
i
not
quite
sure
you
know
if
you
think
about
your
spine
long
enough
you
can
imagine
that
it
very
queer
but
i
have
been
thinking
about
my
spine
it
does
interest
me
robson
would
have
told
me
if
he
thought
i
was
shamming
because
i
asked
him
to
one
thing
makes
me
think
it
is
fancy
i
keep
on
wanting
to
do
things
i
want
you
do
know
how
i
want
to
go
to
the
top
of
harcombe
hill
and
my
ridiculous
legs
wo
let
me
and
all
the
while
kitty
i
want
to
play
it
such
a
long
time
since
i
made
my
pretty
music
a
long
time
indeed
as
kitty
was
thinking
sadly
lucia
had
not
made
her
pretty
music
since
that
night
six
months
ago
when
she
had
played
to
please
keith
rickman
things
keep
on
singing
in
my
head
and
i
want
to
play
them
it
stands
to
reason
that
i
would
if
i
could
but
i
oh
how
i
do
talk
about
myself
kitty
there
must
be
a
fine
a
heavy
fine
of
sixpence
every
time
i
talk
about
myself
i
should
make
much
by
it
said
kitty
lucia
closed
her
eyes
and
kitty
went
on
with
the
manuscript
she
was
copying
after
a
silence
of
twenty
minutes
lucia
opened
her
eyes
again
they
rested
longingly
on
kitty
at
her
work
kitty
she
said
do
you
know
i
sometimes
think
it
would
be
better
to
sell
those
books
i
ca
bear
to
do
it
when
he
gave
them
to
me
but
i
do
believe
i
ought
to
the
worst
of
it
is
i
should
have
to
ask
him
to
do
it
for
me
do
do
anything
in
a
hurry
dear
wait
and
see
said
kitty
cheerfully
it
seemed
to
lucia
that
there
was
nothing
to
wait
for
now
she
wondered
why
kitty
said
that
and
whether
it
meant
that
they
thought
her
worse
than
they
liked
to
say
and
whether
that
was
why
sir
wilfrid
spence
was
coming
kitty
she
said
again
i
want
you
to
promise
me
something
supposing
it
very
unlikely
but
supposing
after
all
i
were
to
go
and
die
i
wo
suppose
anything
of
the
sort
people
do
go
and
die
of
nervous
exhaustion
you
probably
do
it
fifty
years
hence
but
that
is
just
the
reason
why
i
wo
have
you
harrowing
my
feelings
this
way
now
i
know
i
had
such
piles
of
sympathy
for
my
nervous
exhaustion
that
it
horrid
of
me
to
try
and
get
more
for
dying
too
i
only
meant
if
i
did
do
it
quite
unexpectedly
of
something
else
you
would
tell
him
would
you
well
dear
of
course
i
wo
mention
it
if
you
wish
me
not
to
but
he
be
sure
to
see
it
in
the
papers
kitty
you
know
what
i
mean
he
could
see
in
the
papers
he
could
see
it
anywhere
unless
you
told
him
and
if
you
did
it
might
make
him
very
uncomfortable
you
know
poor
kitty
trying
to
be
cheerful
under
the
shadow
of
sir
wilfrid
spence
was
tortured
by
this
conversation
she
had
half
a
mind
to
say
you
do
seem
to
think
how
uncomfortable
you
making
but
she
forbore
any
remark
of
that
sort
would
rouse
lucia
to
efforts
penitential
in
their
motive
and
more
painful
to
bear
than
this
pitiful
outburst
the
first
in
many
months
of
patience
and
reserve
she
remembered
how
lucia
had
once
nursed
her
through
a
long
illness
in
dresden
it
had
not
been
as
kitty
expressed
it
a
pretty
illness
and
she
had
been
distinctly
irritable
in
her
convalescence
but
lucy
had
been
all
tenderness
had
never
betrayed
impatience
by
any
look
or
word
i
should
mind
anything
if
only
i
been
with
him
when
was
ill
but
perhaps
he
rather
i
had
been
there
i
think
it
that
you
know
that
i
really
can
not
bear
kitty
would
have
turned
to
comfort
her
but
for
the
timely
entrance
of
robert
he
brought
a
letter
for
lucia
which
kitty
welcomed
as
an
agreeable
distraction
it
was
from
horace
jewdwine
any
news
she
asked
presently
yes
what
you
think
he
going
to
paris
then
going
on
to
italy
to
alassio
with
mr
maddox
horace
jewdwine
and
maddox
what
next
it
is
horace
that
going
she
gave
the
letter
to
kitty
because
she
had
shrunk
lately
from
speaking
of
keith
rickman
by
his
name
that
a
very
different
tale
said
kitty
i
so
glad
he
going
that
was
what
he
always
wanted
to
do
do
you
remember
how
i
asked
him
to
be
my
private
secretary
now
i
his
private
secretary
which
is
as
it
should
be
you
mean
am
yes
do
you
think
you
could
hurry
up
so
that
he
get
them
before
he
goes
poor
kitty
i
ca
bear
your
having
all
these
things
to
do
for
me
why
not
you
do
them
for
me
if
it
was
i
not
you
i
wish
it
were
you
i
mean
i
wish
i
were
doing
things
for
you
but
you
have
done
them
all
kitty
i
did
some
i
forget
how
many
you
did
three
darling
only
three
and
there
are
nine
and
twenty
still
he
see
that
i
began
them
kitty
do
you
think
he
wonder
and
guess
why
i
left
off
oh
no
he
is
as
clever
as
all
that
you
must
tell
him
you
writing
the
letter
dear
now
you
you
must
say
a
word
about
my
illness
only
tell
him
i
so
glad
to
hear
he
going
to
alassio
with
mr
maddox
i
do
think
any
the
better
of
him
for
that
fancy
going
to
italy
with
that
brute
of
a
man
he
was
really
a
brute
he
only
said
those
things
because
he
cared
for
him
you
ca
blame
him
for
that
i
do
blame
him
for
that
i
blame
him
for
being
a
most
appalling
bounder
do
you
mind
not
talking
about
him
any
more
no
dear
i
do
a
bit
lucia
lay
very
quiet
for
some
time
before
she
spoke
again
they
say
now
i
sacrificed
his
genius
to
my
pride
you
catch
the
post
wo
you
what
a
plague
i
am
but
if
they
posted
before
seven
he
get
them
in
the
morning
and
he
have
time
to
write
perhaps
he
wo
be
starting
till
the
afternoon
in
the
morning
she
again
betrayed
her
mind
preoccupation
he
must
have
got
them
by
now
kitty
did
you
hear
how
the
wind
blew
in
the
night
he
have
an
awful
crossing
well
then
let
hope
he
wo
be
very
ill
but
he
is
going
by
the
bay
of
biscay
dear
the
wind
blew
furiously
all
morning
and
when
it
dropped
a
little
towards
evening
it
was
followed
by
a
pelting
rain
he
at
dover
now
in
a
mackintosh
said
kitty
by
way
of
consolation
but
lucia
uncomforted
lay
still
listening
to
the
rain
it
danced
like
a
thousand
devils
on
the
gravel
of
the
courtyard
suddenly
she
sat
up
raising
herself
by
her
hands
kitty
she
cried
he
coming
he
is
really
by
the
terrace
you
hear
kitty
heard
nothing
but
the
rain
dancing
on
the
courtyard
and
the
terrace
led
into
it
by
the
other
wing
it
was
impossible
that
lucia
could
have
heard
footsteps
there
but
i
kitty
i
know
it
his
walk
and
he
always
came
that
way
she
slipped
her
feet
swiftly
on
to
the
floor
and
to
kitty
amazement
sat
up
unsupported
kitty
in
terror
ran
to
her
and
put
her
arm
round
her
but
lucia
freed
herself
gently
from
her
grasp
she
was
trembling
in
all
her
body
kitty
herself
heard
footsteps
in
the
courtyard
now
they
stopped
suddenly
and
the
rang
do
go
to
him
kitty
and
tell
him
and
send
him
here
to
me
kitty
went
and
found
keith
rickman
standing
in
the
hall
her
instinct
told
her
that
lucia
must
be
obeyed
and
as
she
sent
him
in
to
her
she
saw
through
the
open
door
that
lucia
rose
to
her
feet
and
came
to
him
and
never
swayed
till
his
arms
held
her
she
clung
to
him
and
he
drew
her
closer
and
lifted
her
and
carried
her
to
her
couch
murmuring
things
inarticulate
yet
so
plain
that
even
she
could
not
misunderstand
i
thought
you
were
going
to
paris
she
said
i
not
i
here
she
sat
up
and
laid
her
hands
about
him
feeling
his
shoulders
and
his
sleeves
how
wet
your
coat
is
he
kissed
her
and
she
held
her
face
against
his
that
was
cold
with
the
wind
and
rain
she
took
his
hands
and
tried
to
warm
them
in
her
own
piteously
forgetful
of
herself
as
if
it
were
he
not
she
who
needed
tenderness
lucy
are
you
very
ill
darling
no
i
am
very
very
well
he
thought
it
was
one
of
those
things
that
people
say
when
they
mean
that
death
is
well
he
gathered
her
to
him
as
if
he
could
hold
her
back
from
death
she
looked
smiling
into
his
face
keith
she
said
you
have
a
mackintosh
you
must
go
away
at
once
to
robert
and
get
dry
not
now
lucy
let
me
stay
how
long
can
you
stay
as
long
as
ever
you
let
me
till
you
go
to
italy
very
well
till
i
go
to
italy
when
are
you
going
not
till
you
well
enough
to
go
with
me
how
did
you
know
i
was
ill
because
i
saw
that
kitty
had
had
to
finish
what
your
dear
little
hands
had
begun
ah
you
should
have
had
them
sooner
why
should
i
have
had
them
at
all
do
you
think
i
would
have
published
them
before
i
knew
i
had
dedicated
them
to
my
wife
keith
dear
you
must
talk
about
that
yet
she
hid
her
face
on
his
shoulder
he
lifted
it
and
looked
at
it
as
if
it
could
have
told
him
what
he
had
to
know
it
told
him
nothing
it
had
not
changed
enough
for
that
it
was
like
a
beautiful
picture
blurred
and
the
sweeter
for
the
blurring
he
laid
his
hand
over
her
heart
at
his
touch
it
leapt
and
throbbed
violently
suggesting
a
new
terror
darling
how
fast
your
heart
beats
am
i
doing
it
harm
no
it
does
mind
but
am
i
tiring
it
no
no
you
resting
it
she
lay
still
a
long
time
without
speaking
till
at
last
he
carried
her
upstairs
and
delivered
her
into
kitty
care
at
the
open
door
of
her
room
he
saw
a
nurse
in
uniform
standing
ready
to
receive
her
her
presence
there
was
ominous
of
the
unutterable
things
he
feared
kitty
said
lucia
when
they
were
alone
it
looks
as
if
i
had
been
shamming
after
all
what
do
you
think
of
me
i
think
perhaps
sir
wilfrid
spence
need
come
down
perhaps
not
and
yet
it
would
be
better
to
know
if
there
really
is
anything
wrong
i
could
let
him
marry
me
it
would
be
awful
i
want
to
be
sure
kitty
for
his
sake
kitty
felt
sure
enough
and
her
certainty
grew
when
lucia
came
down
the
next
morning
but
she
was
unable
to
impart
her
certainty
to
keith
the
most
he
could
do
was
to
hide
his
anxiety
from
lucia
it
wanted
but
a
day
to
the
coming
of
the
great
specialist
and
for
that
day
they
made
such
a
brave
show
of
happiness
that
they
deceived
both
kitty
and
themselves
kitty
firm
in
her
conviction
left
them
to
themselves
that
afternoon
while
she
went
into
harmouth
to
announce
to
doctor
the
miracle
of
her
recovery
when
she
had
left
the
house
a
great
peace
fell
on
them
they
had
so
much
to
say
to
each
other
and
so
little
time
to
say
it
in
when
might
cut
short
their
happiness
but
lucia
was
sorry
for
kitty
poor
kitty
said
she
she
going
to
marry
her
cousin
charlie
palliser
but
that
wo
be
the
same
the
same
as
what
the
same
as
my
marrying
you
oh
keith
that
one
of
the
things
i
said
we
were
to
say
do
you
know
once
kitty
was
angry
with
me
she
said
i
was
playing
with
fire
the
divine
fire
ought
i
to
have
been
afraid
of
it
just
a
little
bit
in
awe
what
of
the
divine
fire
i
gave
it
you
dearest
to
play
with
or
to
warm
your
little
hands
by
and
now
you
given
it
me
to
keep
to
put
my
hands
round
it
so
and
take
care
of
it
and
see
that
it
never
goes
out
i
can
do
that
i
whatever
happens
there
was
always
that
refrain
whatever
happens
i
keep
forgetting
it
does
really
belong
to
me
it
belongs
to
everybody
to
the
whole
world
i
believe
i
jealous
of
the
british
public
it
does
really
love
me
lucy
nor
i
it
whether
it
does
or
not
you
remember
that
i
loved
you
first
before
anybody
ever
knew
i
do
indeed
it
a
shame
to
be
so
glad
because
kitty
is
away
yet
she
continued
to
rejoice
in
the
happiness
that
came
of
their
solitude
it
was
keith
not
kitty
who
arranged
her
cushions
for
her
and
covered
her
feet
keith
not
kitty
who
poured
out
tea
for
her
and
brought
it
her
and
sat
beside
her
afterwards
leaning
over
her
and
stroking
her
soft
hair
as
kitty
loved
to
do
lucy
he
said
suddenly
can
you
stand
living
with
me
in
a
horrid
little
house
in
a
suburb
i
should
love
it
dear
little
house
maddox
is
in
it
now
but
we
turn
him
out
you
do
know
maddox
she
shuddered
and
he
drew
the
rug
in
closer
about
her
it
such
a
tiny
house
lucy
it
would
all
go
into
this
room
this
room
said
lucy
is
much
too
large
there
only
room
for
you
and
me
in
it
all
the
better
so
long
as
there
room
for
me
and
the
walls
are
all
lath
and
plaster
when
maddox
is
in
another
room
i
can
hear
him
breathing
and
when
i
in
another
room
i
shall
hear
you
breathing
and
then
i
shall
know
you
alive
when
i
afraid
you
not
i
glad
the
walls
are
all
lath
and
plaster
but
it
is
a
pretty
house
lucy
it
will
be
a
pretty
house
when
i
in
it
said
she
and
was
admitted
to
have
had
the
best
of
the
argument
then
if
you
really
do
mind
we
sha
have
to
wait
not
a
week
if
you
ready
to
come
to
me
but
lucia
face
was
sad
keith
darling
do
make
plans
till
we
know
what
sir
wilfrid
spence
says
i
shall
whatever
he
says
but
i
suppose
i
must
consult
him
before
i
take
you
to
alassio
for
still
at
his
heart
under
all
its
happiness
there
lay
that
annihilating
doubt
the
doubt
and
the
fear
that
had
been
sown
there
by
horace
jewdwine
he
could
see
for
himself
that
one
of
his
terrors
was
baseless
but
there
remained
that
other
more
terrible
possibility
none
of
them
had
dared
to
put
it
into
words
but
it
was
implied
reiterated
in
the
name
of
sir
wilfrid
spence
he
had
moreover
a
feeling
that
this
happiness
of
his
was
too
perfect
that
it
must
be
taken
away
from
him
he
confided
his
trouble
to
kitty
that
night
sitting
up
over
the
fire
lucia
doctor
had
come
and
gone
what
did
he
say
kitty
he
says
there
no
need
for
sir
wilfrid
spence
to
see
her
at
all
he
is
going
to
wire
to
him
not
to
come
he
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
then
his
eyes
clouded
no
he
must
come
i
rather
he
came
but
why
he
is
a
nerve
specialist
he
shuddered
i
know
that
why
i
must
have
him
i
ca
trust
these
local
men
it
will
be
horribly
expensive
keith
and
it
throwing
money
away
robson
said
so
that
my
affair
oh
well
as
for
that
it
was
all
arranged
for
nobody
has
any
right
to
arrange
for
it
but
me
much
better
arrange
for
a
good
time
at
alassio
no
i
want
to
be
absolutely
certain
you
tell
me
she
perfectly
well
and
that
doctor
of
yours
swears
she
is
and
i
think
it
and
yet
i
ca
believe
it
i
dare
that
because
you
not
feeling
very
well
yourself
i
know
that
in
some
ways
she
is
getting
stronger
every
minute
but
you
see
i
ca
help
thinking
what
that
other
man
said
what
other
man
well
the
jewdwines
doctor
what
did
say
nothing
it
was
jewdwine
he
told
me
well
that
was
why
their
engagement
was
broken
off
because
she
was
strong
enough
to
marry
kitty
eyes
blazed
he
told
you
not
exactly
he
could
you
know
i
only
thought
their
doctor
must
have
told
him
something
terrible
i
do
suppose
he
told
him
anything
of
the
sort
oh
well
you
know
he
did
say
so
but
he
let
me
think
it
yes
i
know
exactly
how
it
was
done
he
would
say
anything
he
ought
to
but
he
let
you
think
it
it
was
just
his
awful
selfishness
he
thought
there
was
an
off
chance
of
poor
lucy
being
a
sort
of
nervous
invalid
and
he
would
risk
the
bother
of
it
but
as
for
their
engagement
there
never
was
any
that
was
another
of
the
things
he
let
you
think
i
suppose
he
cared
for
lucy
as
much
as
he
could
care
for
anybody
but
the
fact
is
he
wants
to
marry
another
woman
and
he
could
bear
to
see
her
married
to
another
man
oh
i
say
you
know
it
sounds
incredible
but
you
do
know
how
utterly
i
distrust
that
man
he
false
through
and
through
there
nothing
sound
in
him
except
his
intellect
i
wish
you
never
known
him
he
been
the
cause
of
all
your
your
suffering
and
lucy
too
you
might
have
been
married
long
ago
if
it
had
been
for
him
no
kitty
i
do
think
that
you
might
really
if
he
had
been
in
the
way
she
would
have
known
that
she
cared
for
you
and
let
you
know
it
too
but
nothing
that
he
ever
did
or
did
do
comes
up
to
this
the
truth
is
kitty
he
thinks
i
rather
a
bad
lot
you
know
my
dear
keith
he
thinks
that
if
does
marry
lucy
he
rather
you
did
he
certainly
hit
on
the
most
effectual
means
of
preventing
it
oh
did
he
he
does
know
me
i
shall
marry
her
whatever
sir
wilfrid
spence
says
if
she
ill
all
the
more
reason
why
i
should
look
after
her
i
only
afraid
lest
lest
she
knew
what
he
thought
and
could
not
say
lest
it
should
not
be
for
very
long
there
are
some
things
he
said
quietly
that
be
taken
away
from
me
kitty
was
silent
for
she
knew
what
things
they
were
you
can
trust
her
to
me
kitty
i
can
indeed
and
so
on
sunday
the
great
man
came
down
it
was
over
in
half
an
hour
that
keith
spent
in
pacing
up
and
down
the
library
the
place
of
so
many
dear
and
tender
and
triumphant
memories
they
sharpened
his
vision
of
lucy
doomed
of
her
sweet
body
delivered
over
to
the
torture
he
did
not
hear
kitty
come
in
till
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
he
turned
as
if
at
the
touch
of
destiny
do
keith
for
goodness
sake
it
all
right
only
he
wants
to
see
you
sir
wilfrid
spence
stood
in
the
alone
he
looked
very
grave
and
grim
he
had
a
manner
a
celebrated
manner
that
had
accomplished
miracles
by
its
tremendous
moral
effect
it
had
helped
to
set
him
on
his
eminence
and
he
was
not
going
to
sacrifice
it
now
he
fixed
his
gaze
on
the
poet
as
he
entered
and
held
him
under
it
for
the
space
of
half
a
minute
without
speaking
he
seemed
this
master
of
the
secrets
of
the
body
to
be
invading
despotically
the
province
of
the
soul
it
struck
rickman
that
the
great
specialist
was
passing
judgement
on
him
to
see
whether
in
all
things
he
were
worthy
of
his
destiny
the
gaze
thus
prolonged
became
more
than
he
could
bear
do
you
mind
telling
me
at
once
what
wrong
with
her
there
is
anything
wrong
with
her
what
fool
ever
told
you
that
there
was
she
has
been
made
ill
with
grief
lucia
herself
came
to
him
there
and
led
him
back
into
the
library
they
sat
together
in
the
held
silent
for
a
little
while
by
the
passing
of
that
shadow
of
their
fear
keith
she
said
at
last
is
it
true
that
you
loved
me
when
you
were
with
me
here
ever
so
long
ago
he
answered
her
and
when
you
came
to
me
and
i
was
horrid
to
you
and
when
i
sent
you
away
and
when
i
never
wrote
to
you
and
horace
made
you
think
forgotten
you
did
you
love
me
then
yes
more
than
i
did
before
lucy
but
keith
you
did
love
me
when
you
were
loving
somebody
else
i
did
more
than
ever
then
that
happened
because
i
loved
you
i
can
understand
all
the
rest
but
i
ca
understand
that
i
think
i
rather
you
did
understand
it
darling
she
sighed
puzzled
over
it
and
gave
it
up
but
you
did
love
me
when
you
when
i
when
you
would
have
me
he
answered
her
but
not
with
words
and
now
said
she
you
going
to
paris
perhaps
you
must
perhaps
they
be
calling
for
you
and
perhaps
i
sha
be
there
do
you
know
lucy
you
got
violets
growing
among
the
roots
of
your
hair
i
know
you
going
to
paris
to
please
me
perhaps
and
after
that
we
going
to
alassio
and
after
that
to
florence
and
rome
all
the
places
where
your
private
secretary
and
when
said
she
is
my
private
secretary
going
to
take
me
home
if
his
play
succeeds
dear
he
wo
have
to
take
you
to
that
horrid
house
of
his
wo
he
but
i
like
it
best
of
all
why
lucy
oh
for
such
a
foolish
reason
because
he
been
in
it
i
afraid
darling
some
of
the
houses
he
been
in
at
that
she
fell
to
a
sudden
breathless
sobbing
as
if
the
life
that
had
come
back
to
her
had
spent
itself
again
in
his
happiness
he
had
forgotten
howland
street
or
if
he
thought
of
it
at
all
he
thought
of
it
as
an
enchanted
spot
the
stage
that
had
brought
him
nearest
to
the
place
of
his
delight
lucy
lucy
how
did
you
know
i
never
meant
you
to
some
one
told
me
and
i
i
went
to
see
it
good
god
i
saw
your
room
the
room
they
carried
you
out
of
if
i
only
known
my
darling
why
did
you
come
to
me
then
why
did
you
i
had
plenty
why
did
you
send
for
me
how
could
i
you
could
you
could
but
sweetest
i
did
even
know
where
you
were
wherever
i
was
i
would
have
come
to
you
i
would
have
taken
you
away
it
was
worth
it
lucy
if
it
had
been
for
that
i
should
be
here
now
looking
back
it
seems
positively
glorious
and
whatever
it
was
i
go
through
years
of
it
for
one
hour
with
you
here
one
of
those
hours
even
when
you
did
love
me
i
always
loved
you
all
my
life
long
only
i
did
know
it
was
you
do
you
remember
my
telling
you
that
your
dream
was
divorced
from
reality
it
was
true
that
was
what
was
wrong
with
me
i
afraid
i
was
always
very
faithful
to
my
dream
because
your
dream
was
always
faithful
to
you
and
yet
it
faithful
lucy
do
you
remember
the
things
i
told
you
can
you
forgive
me
for
being
what
i
was
it
was
before
i
knew
you
yes
but
after
that
was
worse
it
was
the
worst
thing
i
ever
did
because
i
known
you
she
wondered
why
he
asked
forgiveness
of
her
now
of
all
moments
and
as
she
wondered
the
light
dawned
on
her
i
forgive
you
everything
it
was
my
fault
i
should
have
been
there
and
i
was
then
he
knew
that
after
all
she
had
understood
her
love
was
in
her
eyes
in
their
light
and
in
their
darkness
they
gathered
many
flames
of
love
into
that
tender
tragic
gaze
all
pitying
half
maternal
those
eyes
had
never
held
for
him
the
sad
secrets
of
mortality
love
in
them
looked
upon
things
invisible
incorruptible
divining
even
as
it
revealed
the
ultimate
mystery
he
saw
that
in
her
womanhood
nature
was
made
holy
penetrated
by
the
spirit
and
the
fire
of
god
he
knelt
down
and
laid
his
face
against
her
shoulder
and
her
arm
caressing
held
him
there
as
if
it
were
she
who
sheltered
and
protected
keith
she
whispered
did
you
mean
to
marry
me
before
you
came
this
time
or
after
before
oh
before
you
thought
that
terrible
thing
had
happened
to
me
you
thought
you
would
always
have
me
dragging
on
you
and
yet
you
came
it
made
no
difference
you
came
i
came
because
i
wanted
to
take
care
of
you
lucy
i
wanted
nothing
else
that
was
all
lucia
understanding
was
complete
i
knew
you
were
like
that
said
she
i
always
knew
it
she
bent
towards
his
hidden
face
and
raised
it
to
her
own
