not
any

or

or

but
merlin
isle
of
gramarye
where
you
and
i
will
fare
the
children
were
at
the
theatre
acting
to
three
cows
as
much
as
they
could
remember
of
midsummer
night
dream
their
father
had
made
them
a
small
play
out
of
the
big
shakespeare
one
and
they
had
rehearsed
it
with
him
and
with
their
mother
till
they
could
say
it
by
heart
they
began
when
nick
bottom
the
weaver
comes
out
of
the
bushes
with
a
donkey
head
on
his
shoulders
and
finds
titania
queen
of
the
fairies
asleep
then
they
skipped
to
the
part
where
bottom
asks
three
little
fairies
to
scratch
his
head
and
bring
him
honey
and
they
ended
where
he
falls
asleep
in
titania
arms
dan
was
puck
and
nick
bottom
as
well
as
all
three
fairies
he
wore
a
cap
for
puck
and
a
paper
donkey
head
out
of
a
christmas
cracker
but
it
tore
if
you
were
not
careful
for
bottom
una
was
titania
with
a
wreath
of
columbines
and
a
foxglove
wand
the
theatre
lay
in
a
meadow
called
the
long
slip
a
little
carrying
water
to
a
mill
two
or
three
fields
away
bent
round
one
corner
of
it
and
in
the
middle
of
the
bend
lay
a
large
old
fairy
ring
of
darkened
grass
which
was
the
stage
the
millstream
banks
overgrown
with
willow
hazel
and
made
convenient
places
to
wait
in
till
your
turn
came
and
a
who
had
seen
it
said
that
shakespeare
himself
could
not
have
imagined
a
more
suitable
setting
for
his
play
they
were
not
of
course
allowed
to
act
on
midsummer
night
itself
but
they
went
down
after
tea
on
midsummer
eve
when
the
shadows
were
growing
and
they
took
their
supper
eggs
bath
oliver
biscuits
and
salt
in
an
envelope
with
them
three
cows
had
been
milked
and
were
grazing
steadily
with
a
tearing
noise
that
one
could
hear
all
down
the
meadow
and
the
noise
of
the
mill
at
work
sounded
like
bare
feet
running
on
hard
ground
a
cuckoo
sat
on
a
singing
his
broken
june
tune
while
a
busy
kingfisher
crossed
from
the
to
the
brook
which
ran
on
the
other
side
of
the
meadow
everything
else
was
a
sort
of
thick
sleepy
stillness
smelling
of
and
dry
grass
their
play
went
beautifully
dan
remembered
all
his
parts
puck
bottom
and
the
three
fairies
and
una
never
forgot
a
word
of
titania
not
even
the
difficult
piece
where
she
tells
the
fairies
how
to
feed
bottom
with
green
figs
and
dewberries
and
all
the
lines
end
in
they
were
both
so
pleased
that
they
acted
it
three
times
over
from
beginning
to
end
before
they
sat
down
in
the
unthistly
centre
of
the
ring
to
eat
eggs
and
bath
olivers
this
was
when
they
heard
a
whistle
among
the
alders
on
the
bank
and
they
jumped
the
bushes
parted
in
the
very
spot
where
dan
had
stood
as
puck
they
saw
a
small
brown
person
with
a
snub
nose
slanting
blue
eyes
and
a
grin
that
ran
right
across
his
freckled
face
he
shaded
his
forehead
as
though
he
were
watching
quince
snout
bottom
and
the
others
rehearsing
pyramus
and
thisbe
and
in
a
voice
as
deep
as
three
cows
asking
to
be
milked
he
began
hempen
homespuns
have
we
swaggering
here
so
near
the
cradle
of
the
fairy
queen
he
stopped
hollowed
one
hand
round
his
ear
and
with
a
wicked
twinkle
in
his
eye
went
on
a
play
toward
i
be
an
auditor
an
actor
too
perhaps
if
i
see
cause
the
children
looked
and
gasped
the
small
thing
he
was
no
taller
than
dan
shoulder
stepped
quietly
into
the
ring
rather
out
of
practice
said
he
that
the
way
my
part
ought
to
be
played
still
the
children
stared
at
him
from
his
cap
like
a
big
columbine
flower
to
his
bare
hairy
feet
at
last
he
laughed
do
look
like
that
it
is
my
fault
what
else
could
you
expect
he
said
did
expect
any
one
dan
answered
slowly
is
our
field
it
said
their
visitor
sitting
down
what
on
human
earth
made
you
act
midsummer
night
dream
three
times
over
on
midsummer
eve
in
the
middle
of
a
ring
and
under
right
under
one
of
my
oldest
hills
in
old
england
pook
hill
puck
hill
puck
hill
hill
it
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
my
face
he
pointed
to
the
bare
slope
of
pook
hill
that
runs
up
from
the
far
side
of
the
to
a
dark
wood
beyond
that
wood
the
ground
rises
and
rises
for
five
hundred
feet
till
at
last
you
climb
out
on
the
bare
top
of
beacon
hill
to
look
over
the
pevensey
levels
and
the
channel
and
half
the
naked
south
downs
oak
ash
and
thorn
he
cried
still
laughing
this
had
happened
a
few
hundred
years
ago
you
have
had
all
the
people
of
the
hills
out
like
bees
in
june
did
know
it
was
wrong
said
dan
the
little
fellow
shook
with
laughter
it
wrong
you
done
something
that
kings
and
knights
and
scholars
in
old
days
would
have
given
their
crowns
and
spurs
and
books
to
find
out
if
merlin
himself
had
helped
you
you
could
have
managed
better
you
broken
the
hills
you
broken
the
hills
it
has
happened
in
a
thousand
years
we
did
mean
to
said
una
course
you
did
that
just
why
you
did
it
unluckily
the
hills
are
empty
now
and
all
the
people
of
the
hills
are
gone
i
the
only
one
left
i
puck
the
oldest
old
thing
in
england
very
much
at
your
service
if
if
you
care
to
have
anything
to
do
with
me
if
you
do
of
course
you
only
to
say
so
and
i
go
he
looked
at
the
children
and
the
children
looked
at
him
for
quite
half
a
minute
his
eyes
did
not
twinkle
any
more
they
were
very
kind
and
there
was
the
beginning
of
a
good
smile
on
his
lips
una
put
out
her
hand
go
she
said
like
you
a
bath
oliver
said
dan
and
he
passed
over
the
squashy
envelope
with
the
eggs
oak
ash
and
thorn
cried
puck
taking
off
his
blue
cap
like
you
too
sprinkle
a
plenty
salt
on
the
biscuit
dan
and
i
eat
it
with
you
that
show
you
the
sort
of
person
i
am
some
of
us
he
went
on
with
his
mouth
full
abide
salt
or
over
a
door
or
berries
or
running
water
or
cold
iron
or
the
sound
of
church
bells
but
i
puck
he
brushed
the
crumbs
carefully
from
his
doublet
and
shook
hands
always
said
dan
and
i
una
stammered
if
it
ever
happened
we
know
what
to
do
but
but
now
it
seems
all
different
somehow
means
meeting
a
fairy
dan
never
believed
in
not
after
i
was
six
anyhow
did
said
una
least
i
sort
of
half
believed
till
we
learned
farewell
rewards
do
you
know
farewell
rewards
and
fairies
you
mean
this
said
puck
he
threw
his
big
head
back
and
began
at
the
second
line
housewives
now
may
say
for
now
foul
sluts
in
dairies
do
fare
as
well
as
they
and
though
they
sweep
their
hearths
no
less
in
una
than
maids
were
wont
to
do
yet
who
of
late
for
cleanliness
finds
sixpence
in
her
shoe
the
echoes
flapped
all
along
the
flat
meadow
course
i
know
it
he
said
then
there
the
verse
about
the
rings
said
dan
i
was
little
it
always
made
me
feel
unhappy
in
my
inside
those
rings
and
roundelays
do
you
mean
boomed
puck
with
a
voice
like
a
great
church
organ
theirs
which
yet
remain
were
footed
in
queen
mary
days
on
many
a
grassy
plain
but
since
of
late
elizabeth
and
later
james
came
in
are
never
seen
on
any
heath
as
when
the
time
hath
been
some
time
since
i
heard
that
sung
but
there
no
good
beating
about
the
bush
it
true
the
people
of
the
hills
have
all
left
i
saw
them
come
into
old
england
and
i
saw
them
go
giants
trolls
kelpies
brownies
goblins
imps
wood
tree
mound
and
water
spirits
good
people
little
people
pishogues
leprechauns
pixies
nixies
gnomes
and
the
rest
gone
all
gone
i
came
into
england
with
oak
ash
and
thorn
and
when
oak
ash
and
thorn
are
gone
i
shall
go
too
dan
looked
round
the
meadow
at
una
oak
by
the
lower
gate
at
the
line
of
ash
trees
that
overhang
otter
pool
where
the
millstream
spills
over
when
the
mill
does
not
need
it
and
at
the
gnarled
old
where
three
cows
scratched
their
necks
all
right
he
said
and
added
planting
a
lot
of
acorns
this
autumn
too
are
you
most
awfully
old
said
una
old
fairly
as
folk
say
hereabouts
let
me
see
my
friends
used
to
set
my
dish
of
cream
for
me
o
nights
when
stonehenge
was
new
yes
before
the
flint
men
made
the
dewpond
under
chanctonbury
ring
una
clasped
her
hands
cried
and
nodded
her
head
thought
a
plan
dan
explained
always
does
like
that
when
she
thinks
a
plan
was
thinking
suppose
we
saved
some
of
our
porridge
and
put
it
in
the
attic
for
you
they
notice
if
we
left
it
in
the
nursery
said
dan
quickly
and
una
flushed
because
they
had
made
a
solemn
treaty
that
summer
not
to
call
the
schoolroom
the
nursery
any
more
your
heart
o
gold
said
puck
make
a
fine
considering
wench
some
i
really
do
want
you
to
put
out
a
bowl
for
me
but
if
ever
i
need
a
bite
be
sure
i
tell
you
he
stretched
himself
at
length
on
the
dry
grass
and
the
children
stretched
out
beside
him
their
bare
legs
waving
happily
in
the
air
they
felt
they
could
not
be
afraid
of
him
any
more
than
of
their
particular
friend
old
hobden
the
hedger
he
did
not
bother
them
with
questions
or
laugh
at
the
donkey
head
but
lay
and
smiled
to
himself
in
the
most
sensible
way
you
a
knife
on
you
he
said
at
last
dan
handed
over
his
big
outdoor
knife
and
puck
began
to
carve
out
a
piece
of
turf
from
the
centre
of
the
ring
that
for
magic
said
una
as
he
pressed
up
the
square
of
chocolate
loam
that
cut
like
so
much
cheese
of
my
little
magics
he
answered
and
cut
another
see
i
ca
let
you
into
the
hills
because
the
people
of
the
hills
have
gone
but
if
you
care
to
take
seisin
from
me
i
may
be
able
to
show
you
something
out
of
the
common
here
on
human
earth
you
certainly
deserve
it
taking
seisin
said
dan
cautiously
an
old
custom
the
people
had
when
they
bought
and
sold
land
they
used
to
cut
out
a
clod
and
hand
it
over
to
the
buyer
and
you
were
lawfully
seised
of
your
land
it
did
really
belong
to
you
till
the
other
fellow
had
actually
given
you
a
piece
of
it
this
he
held
out
the
turves
it
our
own
meadow
said
dan
drawing
back
you
going
to
magic
it
away
puck
laughed
know
it
your
meadow
but
there
a
great
deal
more
in
it
than
you
or
your
father
ever
guessed
try
he
turned
his
eyes
on
una
do
it
she
said
dan
followed
her
example
at
once
are
you
two
lawfully
seised
and
possessed
of
all
old
england
began
puck
in
a
voice
right
of
oak
ash
and
thorn
are
you
free
to
come
and
go
and
look
and
know
where
i
shall
show
or
best
you
please
you
shall
see
what
you
shall
see
and
you
shall
hear
what
you
shall
hear
though
it
shall
have
happened
three
thousand
year
and
you
shall
know
neither
doubt
nor
fear
fast
hold
fast
all
i
give
you
the
children
shut
their
eyes
but
nothing
happened
said
una
disappointedly
opening
them
thought
there
would
be
dragons
it
shall
have
happened
three
thousand
year
said
puck
and
counted
on
his
fingers
i
afraid
there
were
no
dragons
three
thousand
years
ago
there
has
happened
anything
at
all
said
dan
awhile
said
puck
do
grow
an
oak
in
a
year
and
old
england
older
than
twenty
oaks
let
sit
down
again
and
think
i
can
do
that
for
a
century
at
a
time
but
you
a
fairy
said
dan
you
ever
heard
me
say
that
word
yet
said
puck
quickly
you
talk
about
the
people
of
the
hills
but
you
never
say
fairies
said
una
was
wondering
at
that
do
you
like
it
would
you
like
to
be
called
mortal
or
human
being
all
the
time
said
puck
son
of
adam
or
daughter
of
eve
should
like
it
at
all
said
dan
how
the
djinns
and
afrits
talk
in
the
arabian
nights
that
how
i
feel
about
saying
that
word
that
i
do
say
besides
what
you
call
them
are
things
the
people
of
the
hills
have
never
heard
of
little
buzzflies
with
butterfly
wings
and
gauze
petticoats
and
shiny
stars
in
their
hair
and
a
wand
like
a
schoolteacher
cane
for
punishing
bad
boys
and
rewarding
good
ones
i
know
do
mean
that
sort
dan
hate
too
said
puck
you
wonder
that
the
people
of
the
hills
do
care
to
be
confused
with
that
set
of
impostors
butterfly
wings
indeed
i
seen
sir
huon
and
a
troop
of
his
people
setting
off
from
tintagel
castle
for
in
the
teeth
of
a
gale
with
the
spray
flying
all
over
the
castle
and
the
horses
of
the
hills
wild
with
fright
out
they
go
in
a
lull
screaming
like
gulls
and
back
be
driven
five
good
miles
inland
before
they
could
come
head
to
wind
again
it
was
magic
magic
as
black
as
merlin
could
make
it
and
the
whole
sea
was
green
fire
and
white
foam
with
singing
mermaids
in
it
and
the
horses
of
the
hills
picked
their
way
from
one
wave
to
another
by
the
lightning
flashes
that
was
how
it
was
in
the
old
days
said
dan
but
una
shuddered
glad
they
gone
then
but
what
made
the
people
of
the
hills
go
away
una
asked
things
i
tell
you
one
of
them
some
day
the
thing
that
made
the
biggest
flit
of
any
said
puck
they
did
all
flit
at
once
they
dropped
off
one
by
one
through
the
centuries
most
of
them
were
foreigners
who
could
stand
our
climate
they
flitted
early
early
said
dan
couple
of
thousand
years
or
more
the
fact
is
they
began
as
gods
the
phoenicians
brought
some
over
when
they
came
to
buy
tin
and
the
gauls
and
the
jutes
and
the
danes
and
the
frisians
and
the
angles
brought
more
when
they
landed
they
were
always
landing
in
those
days
or
being
driven
back
to
their
ships
and
they
always
brought
their
gods
with
them
england
is
a
bad
country
for
gods
now
i
began
as
i
mean
to
go
on
a
bowl
of
porridge
a
dish
of
milk
and
a
little
quiet
fun
with
the
country
folk
in
the
lanes
was
enough
for
me
then
as
it
is
now
i
belong
here
you
see
and
i
have
been
mixed
up
with
people
all
my
days
but
most
of
the
others
insisted
on
being
gods
and
having
temples
and
altars
and
priests
and
sacrifices
of
their
own
burned
in
wicker
baskets
said
dan
miss
blake
tells
us
about
sorts
of
sacrifices
said
puck
it
was
men
it
was
horses
or
cattle
or
pigs
or
metheglin
that
a
sticky
sweet
sort
of
beer
i
never
liked
it
they
were
a
extravagant
set
of
idols
the
old
things
but
what
was
the
result
men
do
like
being
sacrificed
at
the
best
of
times
they
do
even
like
sacrificing
their
after
a
while
men
simply
left
the
old
things
alone
and
the
roofs
of
their
temples
fell
in
and
the
old
things
had
to
scuttle
out
and
pick
up
a
living
as
they
could
some
of
them
took
to
hanging
about
trees
and
hiding
in
graves
and
groaning
o
nights
if
they
groaned
loud
enough
and
long
enough
they
might
frighten
a
poor
countryman
into
sacrificing
a
hen
or
leaving
a
pound
of
butter
for
them
i
remember
one
goddess
called
belisama
she
became
a
common
wet
somewhere
in
lancashire
and
there
were
hundreds
of
other
friends
of
mine
first
they
were
gods
then
they
were
people
of
the
hills
and
then
they
flitted
to
other
places
because
they
could
get
on
with
the
english
for
one
reason
or
another
there
was
only
one
old
thing
i
remember
who
honestly
worked
for
his
living
after
he
came
down
in
the
world
he
was
called
weland
and
he
was
a
smith
to
some
gods
i
forgotten
their
names
but
he
used
to
make
them
swords
and
spears
i
think
he
claimed
kin
with
thor
of
the
scandinavians
of
asgard
thor
said
una
she
had
been
reading
the
book
answered
puck
the
less
when
bad
times
came
he
did
beg
or
steal
he
worked
and
i
was
lucky
enough
to
be
able
to
do
him
a
good
turn
us
about
it
said
dan
think
i
like
hearing
of
old
things
they
rearranged
themselves
comfortably
each
chewing
a
grass
stem
puck
propped
himself
on
one
strong
arm
and
went
on
think
i
met
weland
first
on
a
november
afternoon
in
a
sleet
storm
on
pevensey
level
over
the
hill
you
mean
dan
pointed
south
but
it
was
all
marsh
in
those
days
right
up
to
horsebridge
and
hydeneye
i
was
on
beacon
hill
they
called
it
brunanburgh
then
when
i
saw
the
pale
flame
that
burning
thatch
makes
and
i
went
down
to
look
some
pirates
i
think
they
must
have
been
peor
men
were
burning
a
village
on
the
levels
and
weland
image
a
big
black
wooden
thing
with
amber
beads
round
his
neck
lay
in
the
bows
of
a
black
galley
that
they
had
just
beached
bitter
cold
it
was
there
were
icicles
hanging
from
her
deck
and
the
oars
were
glazed
over
with
ice
and
there
was
ice
on
weland
lips
when
he
saw
me
he
began
a
long
chant
in
his
own
tongue
telling
me
how
he
was
going
to
rule
england
and
how
i
should
smell
the
smoke
of
his
altars
from
lincolnshire
to
the
isle
of
wight
i
did
care
i
seen
too
many
gods
charging
into
old
england
to
be
upset
about
it
i
let
him
sing
himself
out
while
his
men
were
burning
the
village
and
then
i
said
i
do
know
what
put
it
into
my
head
smith
of
the
gods
i
said
the
time
comes
when
i
shall
meet
you
plying
your
trade
for
hire
by
the
wayside
did
weland
say
said
una
he
angry
called
me
names
and
rolled
his
eyes
and
i
went
away
to
wake
up
the
people
inland
but
the
pirates
conquered
the
country
and
for
centuries
weland
was
a
most
important
god
he
had
temples
everywhere
from
lincolnshire
to
the
isle
of
wight
as
he
said
and
his
sacrifices
were
simply
scandalous
to
do
him
justice
he
preferred
horses
to
men
but
men
or
horses
i
knew
that
presently
he
have
to
come
down
in
the
world
like
the
other
old
things
i
gave
him
lots
of
time
i
gave
him
about
a
thousand
years
and
at
the
end
of
i
went
into
one
of
his
temples
near
andover
to
see
how
he
prospered
there
was
his
altar
and
there
was
his
image
and
there
were
his
priests
and
there
were
the
congregation
and
everybody
seemed
quite
happy
except
weland
and
the
priests
in
the
old
days
the
congregation
were
unhappy
until
the
priests
had
chosen
their
sacrifices
and
so
would
you
have
been
when
the
service
began
a
priest
rushed
out
dragged
a
man
up
to
the
altar
pretended
to
hit
him
on
the
head
with
a
little
gilt
axe
and
the
man
fell
down
and
pretended
to
die
then
everybody
shouted
a
sacrifice
to
weland
a
sacrifice
to
weland
the
man
was
really
dead
said
una
a
bit
all
as
much
pretence
as
a
dolls
then
they
brought
out
a
splendid
white
horse
and
the
priest
cut
some
hair
from
its
mane
and
tail
and
burned
it
on
the
altar
shouting
a
sacrifice
that
counted
the
same
as
if
a
man
and
a
horse
had
been
killed
i
saw
poor
weland
face
through
the
smoke
and
i
could
help
laughing
he
looked
so
disgusted
and
so
hungry
and
all
he
had
to
satisfy
himself
was
a
horrid
smell
of
burning
hair
just
a
dolls
judged
it
better
not
to
say
anything
then
have
been
fair
and
the
next
time
i
came
to
andover
a
few
hundred
years
later
weland
and
his
temple
were
gone
and
there
was
a
christian
bishop
in
a
church
there
none
of
the
people
of
the
hills
could
tell
me
anything
about
him
and
i
supposed
that
he
had
left
england
puck
turned
lay
on
his
other
elbow
and
thought
for
a
long
time
see
he
said
at
last
must
have
been
some
few
years
later
a
year
or
two
before
the
conquest
i
think
that
i
came
back
to
pook
hill
here
and
one
evening
i
heard
old
hobden
talking
about
weland
ford
you
mean
old
hobden
the
hedger
he
only
he
told
me
so
himself
said
dan
a
intimate
friend
of
ours
quite
right
puck
replied
meant
old
hobden
ninth
he
was
a
free
man
and
burned
charcoal
hereabouts
i
known
the
family
father
and
son
so
long
that
i
get
confused
sometimes
hob
of
the
dene
was
my
hobden
name
and
he
lived
at
the
forge
cottage
of
course
i
pricked
up
my
ears
when
i
heard
weland
mentioned
and
i
scuttled
through
the
woods
to
the
ford
just
beyond
bog
wood
yonder
he
jerked
his
head
westward
where
the
valley
narrows
between
wooded
hills
and
steep
that
willingford
bridge
said
una
go
there
for
walks
often
there
a
kingfisher
there
was
weland
ford
then
dearie
a
road
led
down
to
it
from
the
beacon
on
the
top
of
the
hill
a
shocking
bad
road
it
was
and
all
the
hillside
was
thick
thick
with
deer
in
it
there
was
no
trace
of
weland
but
presently
i
saw
a
fat
old
farmer
riding
down
from
the
beacon
under
the
greenwood
tree
his
horse
had
cast
a
shoe
in
the
clay
and
when
he
came
to
the
ford
he
dismounted
took
a
penny
out
of
his
purse
laid
it
on
a
stone
tied
the
old
horse
to
an
oak
and
called
out
smith
smith
here
is
work
for
you
then
he
sat
down
and
went
to
sleep
you
can
imagine
how
i
felt
when
i
saw
a
bent
old
blacksmith
in
a
leather
apron
creep
out
from
behind
the
oak
and
begin
to
shoe
the
horse
it
was
weland
himself
i
was
so
astonished
that
i
jumped
out
and
said
what
on
human
earth
are
you
doing
here
weland
weland
sighed
una
pushed
the
long
hair
back
from
his
forehead
he
did
recognize
me
at
first
then
he
said
you
ought
to
know
you
foretold
it
old
thing
i
shoeing
horses
for
hire
i
not
even
weland
now
he
said
they
call
me
chap
said
dan
did
you
say
could
i
say
he
looked
up
with
the
horse
foot
on
his
lap
and
he
said
smiling
i
remember
the
time
when
i
would
have
accepted
this
old
bag
of
bones
as
a
sacrifice
and
now
i
glad
enough
to
shoe
him
for
a
penny
there
any
way
for
you
to
get
back
to
valhalla
or
wherever
you
come
from
i
said
afraid
not
he
said
rasping
away
at
the
hoof
he
had
a
wonderful
touch
with
horses
the
old
beast
was
whinnying
on
his
shoulder
you
may
remember
that
i
was
not
a
gentle
god
in
my
day
and
my
time
and
my
power
i
shall
never
be
released
till
some
human
being
truly
wishes
me
well
said
i
the
farmer
ca
do
less
than
that
you
shoeing
the
horse
all
round
for
him
said
he
and
my
nails
will
hold
a
shoe
from
one
full
moon
to
the
next
but
farmers
and
weald
clay
said
he
are
both
uncommon
cold
and
sour
you
believe
it
that
when
that
farmer
woke
and
found
his
horse
shod
he
rode
away
without
one
word
of
thanks
i
was
so
angry
that
i
wheeled
his
horse
right
round
and
walked
him
back
three
miles
to
the
beacon
just
to
teach
the
old
sinner
politeness
you
invisible
said
una
puck
nodded
gravely
beacon
was
always
laid
in
those
days
ready
to
light
in
case
the
french
landed
at
pevensey
and
i
walked
the
horse
about
and
about
it
that
summer
night
the
farmer
thought
he
was
bewitched
well
he
was
of
course
and
began
to
pray
and
shout
i
did
care
i
was
as
good
a
christian
as
he
any
in
the
county
and
about
four
in
the
morning
a
young
novice
came
along
from
the
monastery
that
used
to
stand
on
the
top
of
beacon
hill
a
novice
said
dan
really
means
a
man
who
is
beginning
to
be
a
monk
but
in
those
days
people
sent
their
sons
to
a
monastery
just
the
same
as
a
school
this
young
fellow
had
been
to
a
monastery
in
france
for
a
few
months
every
year
and
he
was
finishing
his
studies
in
the
monastery
close
to
his
home
here
hugh
was
his
name
and
he
had
got
up
to
go
fishing
hereabouts
his
people
owned
all
this
valley
hugh
heard
the
farmer
shouting
and
asked
him
what
in
the
world
he
meant
the
old
man
spun
him
a
wonderful
tale
about
fairies
and
goblins
and
witches
and
i
know
he
had
seen
a
thing
except
rabbits
and
red
deer
all
that
night
the
people
of
the
hills
are
like
otters
they
do
show
except
when
they
choose
but
the
novice
was
a
fool
he
looked
down
at
the
horse
feet
and
saw
the
new
shoes
fastened
as
only
weland
knew
how
to
fasten
weland
had
a
way
of
turning
down
the
nails
that
folks
called
the
smith
clinch
said
the
novice
where
did
you
get
your
horse
shod
farmer
would
tell
him
at
first
because
the
priests
never
liked
their
people
to
have
any
dealings
with
the
old
things
at
last
he
confessed
that
the
smith
had
done
it
what
did
you
pay
him
said
the
novice
penny
said
the
farmer
very
sulkily
that
less
than
a
christian
would
have
charged
said
the
novice
i
hope
you
threw
a
you
into
the
bargain
no
said
the
farmer
a
heathen
heathen
or
no
heathen
said
the
novice
you
took
his
help
and
where
you
get
help
there
you
must
give
thanks
what
said
the
farmer
he
was
in
a
furious
temper
because
i
was
walking
the
old
horse
in
circles
all
this
time
what
you
young
jackanapes
said
he
then
by
your
reasoning
i
ought
to
say
you
to
satan
if
he
helped
me
do
roll
about
up
there
splitting
reasons
with
me
said
the
novice
come
back
to
the
ford
and
thank
the
smith
or
be
sorry
the
farmer
had
to
go
i
led
the
horse
though
no
one
saw
me
and
the
novice
walked
beside
us
his
gown
swishing
through
the
shiny
dew
and
his
across
his
shoulders
when
we
reached
the
ford
again
it
was
five
and
misty
still
under
the
oaks
the
farmer
simply
would
say
thank
you
he
said
he
tell
the
abbot
that
the
novice
wanted
him
to
worship
heathen
gods
then
hugh
the
novice
lost
his
temper
he
just
cried
out
put
his
arm
under
the
farmer
fat
leg
and
heaved
him
from
his
saddle
on
to
the
turf
and
before
he
could
rise
he
caught
him
by
the
back
of
the
neck
and
shook
him
like
a
rat
till
the
farmer
growled
thank
you
weland
see
all
this
said
dan
yes
and
he
shouted
his
old
when
the
farmer
thudded
on
to
the
ground
he
was
delighted
then
the
novice
turned
to
the
oak
tree
and
said
ho
smith
of
the
gods
i
am
ashamed
of
this
rude
farmer
but
for
all
you
have
done
in
kindness
and
charity
to
him
and
to
others
of
our
people
i
thank
you
and
wish
you
well
then
he
picked
up
his
it
looked
more
like
a
tall
spear
than
ever
and
tramped
off
down
your
valley
what
did
poor
weland
do
said
una
laughed
and
he
cried
with
joy
because
he
had
been
released
at
last
and
could
go
away
but
he
was
an
honest
old
thing
he
had
worked
for
his
living
and
he
paid
his
debts
before
he
left
i
shall
give
that
novice
a
gift
said
weland
a
gift
that
shall
do
him
good
the
wide
world
over
and
old
england
after
him
blow
up
my
fire
old
thing
while
i
get
the
iron
for
my
last
task
then
he
made
a
sword
a
sword
and
i
blew
the
fire
while
he
hammered
by
oak
ash
and
thorn
i
tell
you
weland
was
a
smith
of
the
gods
he
cooled
that
sword
in
running
water
twice
and
the
third
time
he
cooled
it
in
the
evening
dew
and
he
laid
it
out
in
the
moonlight
and
said
runes
that
charms
over
it
and
he
carved
runes
of
prophecy
on
the
blade
old
thing
he
said
to
me
wiping
his
forehead
this
is
the
best
blade
that
weland
ever
made
even
the
user
will
never
know
how
good
it
is
come
to
the
monastery
went
to
the
dormitory
where
the
monks
slept
we
saw
the
novice
fast
asleep
in
his
cot
and
weland
put
the
sword
into
his
hand
and
i
remember
the
young
fellow
gripped
it
in
his
sleep
then
weland
strode
as
far
as
he
dared
into
the
chapel
and
threw
down
all
his
his
hammers
and
pincers
and
rasps
to
show
that
he
had
done
with
them
for
ever
it
sounded
like
suits
of
armour
falling
and
the
sleepy
monks
ran
in
for
they
thought
the
monastery
had
been
attacked
by
the
french
the
novice
came
first
of
all
waving
his
new
sword
and
shouting
saxon
when
they
saw
the
they
were
very
bewildered
till
the
novice
asked
leave
to
speak
and
told
what
he
had
done
to
the
farmer
and
what
he
had
said
to
and
how
though
the
dormitory
light
was
burning
he
had
found
the
wonderful
sword
in
his
cot
abbot
shook
his
head
at
first
and
then
he
laughed
and
said
to
the
novice
son
hugh
it
needed
no
sign
from
a
heathen
god
to
show
me
that
you
will
never
be
a
monk
take
your
sword
and
keep
your
sword
and
go
with
your
sword
and
be
as
gentle
as
you
are
strong
and
courteous
we
will
hang
up
the
smith
tools
before
the
altar
he
said
because
whatever
the
smith
of
the
gods
may
have
been
in
the
old
days
we
know
that
he
worked
honestly
for
his
living
and
made
gifts
to
mother
church
then
they
went
to
bed
again
all
except
the
novice
and
he
sat
up
in
the
garth
playing
with
his
sword
then
weland
said
to
me
by
the
stables
farewell
old
thing
you
had
the
right
of
it
you
saw
me
come
to
england
and
you
see
me
go
farewell
that
he
strode
down
the
hill
to
the
corner
of
the
great
woods
woods
corner
you
call
it
now
to
the
very
place
where
he
had
first
landed
and
i
heard
him
moving
through
the
thickets
towards
horsebridge
for
a
little
and
then
he
was
gone
that
was
how
it
happened
i
saw
it
both
children
drew
a
long
breath
what
happened
to
hugh
the
novice
said
una
the
sword
said
dan
puck
looked
down
the
meadow
that
lay
all
quiet
and
cool
in
the
shadow
of
pook
hill
a
corncrake
jarred
in
a
near
by
and
the
small
trouts
of
the
brook
began
to
jump
a
big
white
moth
flew
unsteadily
from
the
alders
and
flapped
round
the
children
heads
and
the
least
little
haze
of
rose
from
the
brook
you
really
want
to
know
puck
said
do
cried
the
children
good
i
promised
you
that
you
shall
see
what
you
shall
see
and
you
shall
hear
what
you
shall
hear
though
it
shall
have
happened
three
thousand
year
but
just
now
it
seems
to
me
that
unless
you
go
back
to
the
house
people
will
be
looking
for
you
i
walk
with
you
as
far
as
the
gate
you
be
here
when
we
come
again
they
asked
said
puck

here
some
time
already
one
minute
first
please
he
gave
them
each
three
leaves
one
of
oak
one
of
ash
and
one
of
thorn
these
said
he
you
might
be
talking
at
home
of
what
you
seen
and
heard
and
if
i
know
human
beings
they
send
for
the
doctor
bite
they
bit
hard
and
found
themselves
walking
side
by
side
to
the
lower
gate
their
father
was
leaning
over
it
how
did
your
play
go
he
asked
splendidly
said
dan
afterwards
i
think
we
went
to
sleep
it
was
very
hot
and
quiet
do
you
remember
una
una

her
head
and
said
nothing

young
men
at
the
manor
they
were
fishing
a
few
days
later
in
the
bed
of
the
brook
that
for
centuries
had
cut
deep
into
the
soft
valley
soil
the
trees
closing
overhead
made
long
tunnels
through
which
the
sunshine
worked
in
blobs
and
patches
down
in
the
tunnels
were
bars
of
sand
and
gravel
old
roots
and
trunks
covered
with
moss
or
painted
red
by
the
irony
water
foxgloves
growing
lean
and
pale
towards
the
light
clumps
of
fern
and
thirsty
shy
flowers
who
could
not
live
away
from
moisture
and
shade
in
the
pools
you
could
see
the
wave
thrown
up
by
the
trouts
as
they
charged
hither
and
yon
and
the
pools
were
joined
to
each
other
except
in
when
all
was
one
brown
rush
by
sheets
of
thin
broken
water
that
poured
themselves
chuckling
round
the
darkness
of
the
next
bend
this
was
one
of
the
children
most
secret
and
their
particular
friend
old
hobden
the
hedger
had
shown
them
how
to
use
it
except
for
the
click
of
a
rod
hitting
a
low
willow
or
a
switch
and
tussle
among
the
young
ash
leaves
as
a
line
hung
up
for
the
minute
nobody
in
the
hot
pasture
could
have
guessed
what
game
was
going
on
among
the
trouts
below
the
banks
got
half
a
dozen
said
dan
after
a
warm
wet
hour
vote
we
go
up
to
stone
bay
and
try
long
pool
una
nodded
most
of
her
talk
was
by
nods
and
they
crept
from
the
gloom
of
the
tunnels
towards
the
tiny
weir
that
turns
the
brook
into
the
here
the
banks
are
low
and
bare
and
the
glare
of
the
afternoon
sun
on
the
long
pool
below
the
weir
makes
your
eyes
ache
when
they
were
in
the
open
they
nearly
fell
down
with
astonishment
a
huge
grey
horse
whose
crinkled
the
glassy
water
was
drinking
in
the
pool
and
the
ripples
about
his
muzzle
flashed
like
melted
gold
on
his
back
sat
an
old
man
dressed
in
a
loose
glimmery
gown
of
he
was
and
a
iron
helmet
hung
at
his
his
reins
were
of
red
leather
five
or
six
inches
deep
scalloped
at
the
edges
and
his
high
padded
saddle
with
its
red
girths
was
held
fore
and
aft
by
a
red
leather
breastband
and
crupper
said
una
as
though
dan
were
not
staring
his
very
eyes
out
like
the
picture
in
your
room
sir
isumbras
at
the
ford
the
rider
turned
towards
them
and
his
thin
long
face
was
just
as
sweet
and
gentle
as
that
of
the
knight
who
carries
the
children
in
that
picture
should
be
here
now
sir
richard
said
puck
deep
voice
among
the
are
here
the
knight
said
and
he
smiled
at
dan
with
the
string
of
trouts
in
his
hand
seems
no
great
change
in
boys
since
mine
fished
this
water
your
horse
has
drunk
we
shall
be
more
at
ease
in
the
ring
said
puck
and
he
nodded
to
the
children
as
though
he
had
never
magicked
away
their
memories
a
week
before
the
great
horse
turned
and
hoisted
himself
into
the
pasture
with
a
kick
and
a
scramble
that
tore
the
clods
down
rattling
pardon
said
sir
richard
to
dan
these
lands
were
mine
i
never
loved
that
mounted
men
should
cross
the
brook
except
by
the
paved
ford
but
my
swallow
here
was
thirsty
and
i
wished
to
meet
you
very
glad
you
come
sir
dan
does
matter
in
the
least
about
the
banks
he
trotted
across
the
pasture
on
the
sword
side
of
the
mighty
horse
and
it
was
a
mighty
sword
that
swung
from
sir
belt
una
walked
behind
with
puck
she
remembered
everything
now
sorry
about
the
leaves
he
said
it
would
never
have
done
if
you
had
gone
home
and
told
would
it
not
una
answered
you
said
that
all
the
fair
people
of
the
hills
had
left
england
they
have
but
i
told
you
that
you
should
come
and
go
and
look
and
know
did
i
the
knight
is
a
fairy
he
sir
richard
dalyngridge
a
very
old
friend
of
mine
he
came
over
with
william
the
conqueror
and
he
wants
to
see
you
particularly
for
said
una
account
of
your
great
wisdom
and
learning
puck
replied
without
a
twinkle
said
una
i
do
know
my
nine
times
not
to
say
it
dodging
and
dan
makes
the
most
awful
mess
of
fractions
he
ca
mean
us
dan
called
back
richard
says
he
is
going
to
tell
what
happened
to
weland
sword
he
got
it
is
it
splendid
nay
said
sir
richard
dismounting
as
they
reached
the
ring
in
the
bend
of
the
bank
is
you
that
must
tell
me
for
i
hear
the
youngest
child
in
our
england
today
is
as
wise
as
our
wisest
clerk
he
slipped
the
bit
out
of
swallow
mouth
dropped
the
reins
over
his
head
and
the
wise
horse
moved
off
to
graze
sir
richard
they
noticed
he
limped
a
little
unslung
his
great
sword
it
dan
whispered
to
una
is
the
sword
that
brother
hugh
had
from
sir
richard
said
he
gave
it
me
but
i
would
not
take
it
but
at
the
last
it
became
mine
after
such
a
fight
as
never
christened
man
fought
see
he
half
drew
it
from
its
sheath
and
turned
it
before
them
on
either
side
just
below
the
handle
where
the
runic
letters
shivered
as
though
they
were
alive
were
two
deep
gouges
in
the
dull
deadly
steel
what
thing
made
those
said
he
know
not
but
you
perhaps
can
say
them
all
the
tale
sir
richard
said
puck
concerns
their
land
somewhat
from
the
very
beginning
una
pleaded
for
the
knight
good
face
and
the
smile
on
it
more
than
ever
reminded
her
of
isumbras
at
the
ford
they
settled
down
to
listen
sir
richard
to
the
sunshine
dandling
the
sword
in
both
hands
while
the
grey
horse
cropped
outside
the
ring
and
the
helmet
on
the
clinged
softly
each
time
he
jerked
his
head
the
beginning
then
sir
richard
said
it
concerns
your
land
i
will
tell
the
tale
when
our
duke
came
out
of
normandy
to
take
his
england
great
knights
have
ye
heard
came
and
strove
hard
to
serve
the
duke
because
he
promised
them
lands
here
and
small
knights
followed
the
great
ones
my
folk
in
normandy
were
poor
but
a
great
knight
engerrard
of
the
eagle
engenulf
de
aquila
who
was
kin
to
my
father
followed
the
earl
of
mortain
who
followed
william
the
duke
and
i
followed
de
aquila
yes
with
thirty
out
of
my
father
house
and
a
new
sword
i
set
out
to
conquer
england
three
days
after
i
was
made
knight
i
did
not
then
know
that
england
would
conquer
me
we
went
up
to
santlache
with
the
rest
a
very
great
host
of
us
that
mean
the
battle
of
hastings
ten
una
whispered
and
puck
nodded
so
as
not
to
interrupt
santlache
over
the
hill
yonder
he
pointed
towards
fairlight
found
harold
men
we
fought
at
the
day
end
they
ran
my
men
went
with
de
aquila
to
chase
and
plunder
and
in
that
chase
engerrard
of
the
eagle
was
slain
and
his
son
gilbert
took
his
banner
and
his
men
forward
this
i
did
not
know
till
after
for
swallow
here
was
cut
in
the
flank
so
i
stayed
to
wash
the
wound
at
a
brook
by
a
thorn
there
a
single
saxon
cried
out
to
me
in
french
and
we
fought
together
i
should
have
known
his
voice
but
we
fought
together
for
a
long
time
neither
had
any
advantage
till
by
pure
his
foot
slipped
and
his
sword
flew
from
his
hand
now
i
had
but
newly
been
made
knight
and
wished
above
all
to
be
courteous
and
fameworthy
so
i
forbore
to
strike
and
bade
him
get
his
sword
again
a
plague
on
my
sword
said
he
it
has
lost
me
my
first
fight
you
have
spared
my
life
take
my
sword
he
held
it
out
to
me
but
as
i
stretched
my
hand
the
sword
groaned
like
a
stricken
man
and
i
leaped
back
crying
sorcery
the
children
looked
at
the
sword
as
though
it
might
speak
again
a
clump
of
saxons
ran
out
upon
me
and
seeing
a
norman
alone
would
have
killed
me
but
my
saxon
cried
out
that
i
was
his
prisoner
and
beat
them
off
thus
see
you
he
saved
my
life
he
put
me
on
my
horse
and
led
me
through
the
woods
ten
long
miles
to
this
valley
here
mean
said
una
this
very
valley
we
came
in
by
the
lower
ford
under
the
hill
yonder
he
pointed
eastward
where
the
valley
widens
was
that
saxon
hugh
the
novice
dan
asked
and
more
than
that
he
had
been
for
three
years
at
the
monastery
at
bec
by
rouen
where
sir
richard
chuckled
abbot
herluin
would
not
suffer
me
to
remain
would
he
said
dan
i
rode
my
horse
into
the
refectory
when
the
scholars
were
at
meat
to
show
the
saxon
boys
we
normans
were
not
afraid
of
an
abbot
it
was
that
very
saxon
hugh
tempted
me
to
do
it
and
we
had
not
met
since
that
day
i
thought
i
knew
his
voice
even
inside
my
helmet
and
for
all
that
our
lords
fought
we
each
rejoiced
we
had
not
slain
the
other
he
walked
by
my
side
and
he
told
me
how
a
heathen
god
as
he
believed
had
given
him
his
sword
but
he
said
he
had
never
heard
it
sing
before
i
remember
i
warned
him
to
beware
of
sorcery
and
quick
enchantments
sir
richard
smiled
to
himself
was
very
young
very
young
we
came
to
his
house
here
we
had
almost
forgotten
that
we
had
been
at
blows
it
was
near
midnight
and
the
great
hall
was
full
of
men
and
women
waiting
news
there
i
first
saw
his
sister
the
lady
aelueva
of
whom
he
had
spoken
to
us
in
france
she
cried
out
fiercely
at
me
and
would
have
had
me
hanged
in
that
hour
but
her
brother
said
that
i
had
spared
his
life
he
said
not
how
he
saved
mine
from
the
saxons
and
that
our
duke
had
won
the
day
and
even
while
they
wrangled
over
my
poor
body
of
a
sudden
he
fell
down
in
a
swoon
from
his
wounds
is
thy
fault
said
the
lady
aelueva
to
me
and
she
kneeled
above
him
and
called
for
wine
and
cloths
i
had
known
i
answered
he
should
have
ridden
and
i
walked
but
he
set
me
on
my
horse
he
made
no
complaint
he
walked
beside
me
and
spoke
merrily
throughout
i
pray
i
have
done
him
no
harm
hast
need
to
pray
she
said
catching
up
her
underlip
if
he
dies
thou
shalt
hang
bore
off
hugh
to
his
chamber
but
three
tall
men
of
the
house
bound
me
and
set
me
under
the
beam
of
the
great
hall
with
a
rope
round
my
neck
the
end
of
the
rope
they
flung
over
the
beam
and
they
sat
them
down
by
the
fire
to
wait
word
whether
hugh
lived
or
died
they
cracked
nuts
with
their
the
while
how
did
you
feel
said
dan
weary
but
i
did
heartily
pray
for
my
schoolmate
hugh
his
health
about
noon
i
heard
horses
in
the
valley
and
the
three
men
loosed
my
ropes
and
fled
out
and
de
aquila
men
rode
up
gilbert
de
aquila
came
with
them
for
it
was
his
boast
that
like
his
father
he
forgot
no
man
that
served
him
he
was
little
like
his
father
but
terrible
with
a
nose
like
an
eagle
nose
and
yellow
eyes
like
an
eagle
he
rode
tall
warhorses
roans
which
he
bred
himself
and
he
could
never
abide
to
be
helped
into
the
saddle
he
saw
the
rope
hanging
from
the
beam
and
laughed
and
his
men
laughed
for
i
was
too
stiff
to
rise
is
poor
entertainment
for
a
norman
knight
he
said
but
such
as
it
is
let
us
be
grateful
show
me
boy
to
whom
thou
owest
most
and
we
will
pay
them
out
of
hand
did
he
mean
to
kill
said
dan
but
i
looked
at
the
lady
aelueva
where
she
stood
among
her
maids
and
her
brother
beside
her
de
aquila
men
had
driven
them
all
into
the
great
hall
she
pretty
said
una
all
my
long
life
i
have
never
seen
woman
fit
to
strew
rushes
before
my
lady
aelueva
the
knight
replied
quite
simply
and
quietly
i
looked
at
her
i
thought
i
might
save
her
and
her
house
by
a
jest
that
i
came
somewhat
hastily
and
without
warning
said
i
to
de
aquila
i
have
no
fault
to
find
with
the
courtesy
that
these
saxons
have
shown
me
but
my
voice
shook
it
is
it
was
not
good
to
jest
with
that
little
man
were
silent
awhile
till
de
aquila
laughed
look
men
a
miracle
said
he
the
fight
is
scarce
sped
my
father
is
not
yet
buried
and
here
we
find
our
youngest
knight
already
set
down
in
his
manor
while
his
saxons
ye
can
see
it
in
their
fat
faces
have
paid
him
homage
and
service
by
the
saints
he
said
rubbing
his
nose
i
never
thought
england
would
be
so
easy
won
surely
i
can
do
no
less
than
give
the
lad
what
he
has
taken
this
manor
shall
be
thine
boy
he
said
till
i
come
again
or
till
thou
art
slain
now
mount
men
and
ride
we
follow
our
duke
into
kent
to
make
him
king
of
england
drew
me
with
him
to
the
door
while
they
brought
his
horse
a
lean
roan
taller
than
my
swallow
here
but
not
so
well
girthed
to
me
he
said
fretting
with
his
great
i
have
given
thee
this
manor
which
is
a
saxon
hornets
nest
and
i
think
thou
wilt
be
slain
in
a
month
as
my
father
was
slain
yet
if
thou
canst
keep
the
roof
on
the
hall
the
thatch
on
the
barn
and
the
plough
in
the
furrow
till
i
come
back
thou
shalt
hold
the
manor
from
me
for
the
duke
has
promised
our
earl
mortain
all
the
lands
by
pevensey
and
mortain
will
give
me
of
them
what
he
would
have
given
my
father
god
knows
if
thou
or
i
shall
live
till
england
is
won
but
remember
boy
that
here
and
now
fighting
is
foolishness
and
he
reached
for
the
reins
craft
and
cunning
is
all
i
have
no
cunning
said
i
yet
said
he
hopping
abroad
foot
in
stirrup
and
poking
his
horse
in
the
belly
with
his
toe
not
yet
but
i
think
thou
hast
a
good
teacher
farewell
hold
the
manor
and
live
lose
the
manor
and
hang
he
said
and
spurred
out
his
squeaking
behind
him
children
here
was
i
little
more
than
a
boy
and
santlache
fight
not
two
days
old
left
alone
with
my
thirty
in
a
land
i
knew
not
among
a
people
whose
tongue
i
could
not
speak
to
hold
down
the
land
which
i
had
taken
from
them
that
was
here
at
home
said
una
here
see
from
the
upper
ford
weland
ford
to
the
lower
ford
by
the
belle
allee
west
and
east
it
ran
half
a
league
from
the
beacon
of
brunanburgh
behind
us
here
south
and
north
it
ran
a
full
league
and
all
the
woods
were
full
of
broken
men
from
santlache
saxon
thieves
norman
plunderers
robbers
and
a
hornets
nest
indeed
de
aquila
had
gone
hugh
would
have
thanked
me
for
saving
their
lives
but
the
lady
aelueva
said
that
i
had
done
it
only
for
the
sake
of
receiving
the
manor
could
i
know
that
de
aquila
would
give
it
me
i
said
if
i
had
told
him
i
had
spent
my
night
in
your
halter
he
would
have
burned
the
place
twice
over
by
now
any
man
had
put
my
neck
in
a
rope
she
said
i
would
have
seen
his
house
burned
thrice
over
before
i
would
have
made
terms
it
was
a
woman
i
said
and
i
laughed
and
she
wept
and
said
that
i
mocked
her
in
her
captivity
said
i
there
is
no
captive
in
this
valley
except
one
and
he
is
not
a
saxon
this
she
cried
that
i
was
a
norman
thief
who
came
with
false
sweet
words
having
intended
from
the
first
to
turn
her
out
in
the
fields
to
beg
her
bread
into
the
fields
she
had
never
seen
the
face
of
war
was
angry
and
answered
this
much
at
least
i
can
disprove
for
i
swear
and
on
my
i
swore
it
in
that
place
i
swear
i
will
never
set
foot
in
the
great
hall
till
the
lady
aelueva
herself
shall
summon
me
there
went
away
saying
nothing
and
i
walked
out
and
hugh
limped
after
me
whistling
dolorously
that
is
a
custom
of
the
english
and
we
came
upon
the
three
saxons
that
had
bound
me
they
were
now
bound
by
my
and
behind
them
stood
some
fifty
stark
and
sullen
churls
of
the
house
and
the
manor
waiting
to
see
what
should
fall
we
heard
de
aquila
trumpets
blow
thin
through
the
woods
kentward
we
hang
these
said
my
men
my
churls
will
fight
said
hugh
beneath
his
breath
but
i
bade
him
ask
the
three
what
mercy
they
hoped
for
said
they
all
she
bade
us
hang
thee
if
our
master
died
and
we
would
have
hanged
thee
there
is
no
more
to
it
i
stood
doubting
a
woman
ran
down
from
the
oak
wood
above
the
king
hill
yonder
and
cried
out
that
some
normans
were
driving
off
the
swine
there
or
saxon
said
i
we
must
beat
them
back
or
they
will
rob
us
every
day
out
at
them
with
any
arms
ye
have
so
i
loosed
those
three
carles
and
we
ran
together
my
and
the
saxons
with
bills
and
axes
which
they
had
hidden
in
the
thatch
of
their
huts
and
hugh
led
them
up
the
king
hill
we
found
a
false
fellow
from
picardy
a
sutler
that
sold
wine
in
the
duke
camp
with
a
dead
knight
shield
on
his
arm
a
stolen
horse
under
him
and
some
ten
or
twelve
wastrels
at
his
tail
all
cutting
and
slashing
at
the
pigs
we
beat
them
off
and
saved
our
pork
one
hundred
and
seventy
pigs
we
saved
in
that
great
battle
sir
richard
laughed
then
was
our
first
work
together
and
i
bade
hugh
tell
his
folk
that
so
would
i
deal
with
any
man
knight
or
churl
norman
or
saxon
who
stole
as
much
as
one
egg
from
our
valley
said
he
to
me
riding
home
thou
hast
gone
far
to
conquer
england
this
evening
i
answered
england
must
be
thine
and
mine
then
help
me
hugh
to
deal
aright
with
these
people
make
them
to
know
that
if
they
slay
me
de
aquila
will
surely
send
to
slay
them
and
he
will
put
a
worse
man
in
my
place
that
may
well
be
true
said
he
and
gave
me
his
hand
better
the
devil
we
know
than
the
devil
we
know
not
till
we
can
pack
you
normans
home
and
so
too
said
his
saxons
and
they
laughed
as
we
drove
the
pigs
downhill
but
i
think
some
of
them
even
then
began
not
to
hate
me
like
brother
hugh
said
una
softly
question
he
was
the
most
perfect
courteous
valiant
tender
and
wise
knight
that
ever
drew
breath
said
sir
richard
caressing
the
sword
hung
up
his
sword
this
sword
on
the
wall
of
the
great
hall
because
he
said
it
was
fairly
mine
and
never
he
took
it
down
till
de
aquila
returned
as
i
shall
presently
show
for
three
months
his
men
and
mine
guarded
the
valley
till
all
robbers
and
nightwalkers
learned
there
was
nothing
to
get
from
us
save
hard
tack
and
a
hanging
side
by
side
we
fought
against
all
who
came
thrice
a
week
sometimes
we
fought
against
thieves
and
landless
knights
looking
for
good
manors
then
we
were
in
some
peace
and
i
made
shift
by
hugh
help
to
govern
the
valley
for
all
this
valley
of
yours
was
my
manor
as
a
knight
should
i
kept
the
roof
on
the
hall
and
the
thatch
on
the
barn
but
the
english
are
a
bold
people
his
saxons
would
laugh
and
jest
with
hugh
and
hugh
with
them
and
this
was
marvellous
to
me
if
even
the
meanest
of
them
said
that
such
and
such
a
thing
was
the
custom
of
the
manor
then
straightway
would
hugh
and
such
old
men
of
the
manor
as
might
be
near
forsake
everything
else
to
debate
the
matter
i
have
seen
them
stop
the
mill
with
the
corn
half
ground
and
if
the
custom
or
usage
were
proven
to
be
as
it
was
said
why
that
was
the
end
of
it
even
though
it
were
flat
against
hugh
his
wish
and
command
wonderful
said
puck
breaking
in
for
the
first
time
custom
of
old
england
was
here
before
your
norman
knights
came
and
it
outlasted
them
though
they
fought
against
it
cruel
i
said
sir
richard
let
the
saxons
go
their
stubborn
way
but
when
my
own
normans
not
six
months
in
england
stood
up
and
told
me
what
was
the
custom
of
the
country
then
i
was
angry
ah
good
days
ah
wonderful
people
and
i
loved
them
all
the
knight
lifted
his
arms
as
though
he
would
hug
the
whole
dear
valley
and
swallow
hearing
the
chink
of
his
looked
up
and
whinnied
softly
last
he
went
on
a
year
of
striving
and
contriving
and
some
little
driving
de
aquila
came
to
the
valley
alone
and
without
warning
i
saw
him
first
at
the
lower
ford
with
a
swineherd
brat
on
his
is
no
need
for
thee
to
give
any
account
of
thy
stewardship
said
he
i
have
it
all
from
the
child
here
and
he
told
me
how
the
young
thing
had
stopped
his
tall
horse
at
the
ford
by
waving
of
a
branch
and
crying
that
the
way
was
barred
and
if
one
bold
bare
babe
be
enough
to
guard
the
ford
in
these
days
thou
hast
done
well
said
he
and
puffed
and
wiped
his
head
pinched
the
child
cheek
and
looked
at
our
cattle
in
the
flat
by
the
river
fat
said
he
rubbing
his
nose
this
is
craft
and
cunning
such
as
i
love
what
did
i
tell
thee
when
i
rode
away
boy
the
manor
or
hang
said
i
had
never
forgotten
it
and
thou
hast
held
he
clambered
from
his
saddle
and
with
his
sword
point
cut
out
a
turf
from
the
bank
and
gave
it
me
where
i
kneeled
dan
looked
at
una
and
una
looked
at
dan
seisin
said
puck
in
a
whisper
thou
art
lawfully
seised
of
the
manor
sir
richard
said
he
was
the
first
time
he
ever
called
me
that
thou
and
thy
heirs
for
ever
this
must
serve
till
the
king
clerks
write
out
thy
title
on
a
parchment
england
is
all
ours
if
we
can
hold
it
service
shall
i
pay
i
asked
and
i
remember
i
was
proud
beyond
words
fee
boy
knight
fee
said
he
hopping
round
his
horse
on
one
foot
have
i
said
he
was
little
and
could
not
endure
to
be
helped
to
his
saddle
six
mounted
men
or
twelve
archers
thou
shalt
send
me
whenever
i
call
for
them
and
where
got
you
that
corn
said
he
for
it
was
near
harvest
and
our
corn
stood
well
i
have
never
seen
such
bright
straw
send
me
three
bags
of
the
same
seed
yearly
and
furthermore
in
memory
of
our
last
meeting
with
the
rope
round
thy
neck
entertain
me
and
my
men
for
two
days
of
each
year
in
the
great
hall
of
thy
manor
said
i
then
my
manor
is
already
forfeit
i
am
under
vow
not
to
enter
the
great
hall
and
i
told
him
what
i
had
sworn
to
the
lady
aelueva
had
you
ever
been
into
the
house
since
said
una
sir
richard
answered
smiling
had
made
me
a
little
hut
of
wood
up
the
hill
and
there
i
did
justice
and
slept
de
aquila
wheeled
aside
and
his
shield
shook
on
his
back
no
matter
boy
said
he
i
will
remit
the
homage
for
a
year
meant
sir
richard
need
give
him
dinner
there
the
first
year
puck
explained
aquila
stayed
with
me
in
the
hut
and
hugh
who
could
read
and
write
and
cast
accounts
showed
him
the
roll
of
the
manor
in
which
were
written
all
the
names
of
our
fields
and
men
and
he
asked
a
thousand
questions
touching
the
land
the
timber
the
grazing
the
mill
and
the
and
the
worth
of
every
man
in
the
valley
but
never
he
named
the
lady
aelueva
name
nor
went
he
near
the
great
hall
by
night
he
drank
with
us
in
the
hut
yes
he
sat
on
the
straw
like
an
eagle
ruffled
in
her
feathers
his
yellow
eyes
rolling
above
the
cup
and
he
pounced
in
his
talk
like
an
eagle
swooping
from
one
thing
to
another
but
always
binding
fast
yes
he
would
lie
still
awhile
and
then
rustle
in
the
straw
and
speak
sometimes
as
though
he
were
king
william
himself
and
anon
he
would
speak
in
parables
and
tales
and
if
at
once
we
saw
not
his
meaning
he
would
yerk
us
in
the
ribs
with
his
scabbarded
sword
you
boys
said
he
i
am
born
out
of
my
due
time
five
hundred
years
ago
i
would
have
made
all
england
such
an
england
as
neither
dane
saxon
nor
norman
should
have
conquered
five
hundred
years
hence
i
should
have
been
such
a
counsellor
to
kings
as
the
world
hath
never
dreamed
of
is
all
here
said
he
tapping
his
big
head
but
it
hath
no
play
in
this
black
age
now
hugh
here
is
a
better
man
than
thou
art
richard
he
had
made
his
voice
harsh
and
croaking
like
a
raven
said
i
but
for
hugh
his
help
and
patience
and
i
could
never
have
kept
the
manor
thy
life
either
said
de
aquila
hugh
has
saved
thee
not
once
but
a
hundred
times
be
still
hugh
he
said
dost
thou
know
richard
why
hugh
slept
and
why
he
still
sleeps
among
thy
norman
be
near
me
said
i
for
i
thought
this
was
truth
said
de
aquila
it
is
because
his
saxons
have
begged
him
to
rise
against
thee
and
to
sweep
every
norman
out
of
the
valley
no
matter
how
i
know
it
is
truth
therefore
hugh
hath
made
himself
an
hostage
for
thy
life
well
knowing
that
if
any
harm
befell
thee
from
his
saxons
thy
normans
would
slay
him
without
remedy
and
this
his
saxons
know
is
it
true
hugh
some
sort
said
hugh
shamefacedly
at
least
it
was
true
half
a
year
ago
my
saxons
would
not
harm
richard
now
i
think
they
know
him
but
i
judged
it
best
to
make
sure
children
what
that
man
had
done
and
i
had
never
guessed
it
night
after
night
had
he
lain
down
among
my
knowing
that
if
one
saxon
had
lifted
knife
against
me
his
life
would
have
answered
for
mine
said
de
aquila
and
he
is
a
swordless
man
he
pointed
to
hugh
belt
for
hugh
had
put
away
his
sword
did
i
tell
you
day
after
it
flew
from
his
hand
at
santlache
he
carried
only
the
short
knife
and
the
swordless
and
landless
art
thou
hugh
and
they
call
thee
kin
to
earl
godwin
hugh
was
indeed
of
blood
the
manor
that
was
thine
is
given
to
this
boy
and
to
his
children
for
ever
sit
up
and
beg
for
he
can
turn
thee
out
like
a
dog
hugh
said
nothing
but
i
heard
his
teeth
grind
and
i
bade
de
aquila
my
own
overlord
hold
his
peace
or
i
would
stuff
his
words
down
his
throat
then
de
aquila
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
his
face
warned
the
king
said
he
what
would
come
of
giving
england
to
us
norman
thieves
here
art
thou
richard
less
than
two
days
confirmed
in
thy
manor
and
already
thou
hast
risen
against
thy
overlord
what
shall
we
do
to
him
sir
hugh
am
a
swordless
man
said
hugh
do
not
jest
with
me
and
he
laid
his
head
on
his
knees
and
groaned
greater
fool
thou
said
de
aquila
and
all
his
voice
changed
for
i
have
given
thee
the
manor
of
dallington
up
the
hill
this
since
and
he
yerked
at
hugh
with
his
scabbard
across
the
straw
me
said
hugh
i
am
a
saxon
and
except
that
i
love
richard
here
i
have
not
sworn
fealty
to
any
norman
god
good
time
which
because
of
my
sins
i
shall
not
live
to
see
there
will
be
neither
saxon
nor
norman
in
england
said
de
aquila
if
i
know
men
thou
art
more
faithful
unsworn
than
a
score
of
normans
i
could
name
take
dallington
and
join
sir
richard
to
fight
me
tomorrow
if
it
please
thee
said
hugh
i
am
no
child
where
i
take
a
gift
there
i
render
service
and
he
put
his
hands
between
de
aquila
and
swore
to
be
faithful
and
as
i
remember
i
kissed
him
and
de
aquila
kissed
us
both
sat
afterwards
outside
the
hut
while
the
sun
rose
and
de
aquila
marked
our
churls
going
to
their
work
in
the
fields
and
talked
of
holy
things
and
how
we
should
govern
our
manors
in
time
to
come
and
of
hunting
and
of
and
of
the
king
wisdom
and
unwisdom
for
he
spoke
to
us
as
though
we
were
in
all
sorts
now
his
brothers
anon
a
churl
stole
up
to
me
he
was
one
of
the
three
i
had
not
hanged
a
year
ago
and
he
bellowed
which
is
the
saxon
for
whispering
that
the
lady
aelueva
would
speak
to
me
at
the
great
house
she
walked
abroad
daily
in
the
manor
and
it
was
her
custom
to
send
me
word
whither
she
went
that
i
might
set
an
archer
or
two
behind
and
in
front
to
guard
her
very
often
i
myself
lay
up
in
the
woods
and
watched
on
her
also
went
swiftly
and
as
i
passed
the
great
door
it
opened
from
within
and
there
stood
my
lady
aelueva
and
she
said
to
me
sir
richard
will
it
please
you
enter
your
great
hall
then
she
wept
but
we
were
alone
the
knight
was
silent
for
a
long
time
his
face
turned
across
the
valley
smiling
well
done
said
una
and
clapped
her
hands
very
softly
was
sorry
and
she
said
so
she
was
sorry
and
she
said
so
said
sir
richard
coming
back
with
a
little
start
soon
but
he
said
it
was
two
full
hours
later
de
aquila
rode
to
the
door
with
his
shield
new
scoured
hugh
had
cleansed
it
and
demanded
entertainment
and
called
me
a
false
knight
that
would
starve
his
overlord
to
death
then
hugh
cried
out
that
no
man
should
work
in
the
valley
that
day
and
our
saxons
blew
horns
and
set
about
feasting
and
drinking
and
running
of
races
and
dancing
and
singing
and
de
aquila
climbed
upon
a
and
spoke
to
them
in
what
he
swore
was
good
saxon
but
no
man
understood
it
at
night
we
feasted
in
the
great
hall
and
when
the
harpers
and
the
singers
were
gone
we
four
sat
late
at
the
high
table
as
i
remember
it
was
a
warm
night
with
a
full
moon
and
de
aquila
bade
hugh
take
down
his
sword
from
the
wall
again
for
the
honour
of
the
manor
of
dallington
and
hugh
took
it
gladly
enough
dust
lay
on
the
hilt
for
i
saw
him
blow
it
off
and
i
sat
talking
a
little
apart
and
at
first
we
thought
the
harpers
had
come
back
for
the
great
hall
was
filled
with
a
rushing
noise
of
music
de
aquila
leaped
up
but
there
was
only
the
moonlight
fretty
on
the
floor
said
hugh
it
is
my
sword
and
as
he
belted
it
on
the
music
ceased
gods
forbid
that
i
should
ever
belt
blade
like
that
said
de
aquila
what
does
it
foretell
gods
that
made
it
may
know
last
time
it
spoke
was
at
hastings
when
i
lost
all
my
lands
belike
it
sings
now
that
i
have
new
lands
and
am
a
man
again
said
hugh
loosed
the
blade
a
little
and
drove
it
back
happily
into
the
sheath
and
the
sword
answered
him
low
and
crooningly
as
as
a
woman
would
speak
to
a
man
her
head
on
his
shoulder
that
was
the
second
time
in
all
my
life
i
heard
this
sword
sing
said
una
mother
coming
down
the
long
slip
what
will
she
say
to
sir
richard
she
ca
help
seeing
him
puck

magic

this
time
said
dan

puck
and
he
leaned
forward
and
whispered
to
sir
richard
who
smiling
bowed
his
head
what
befell
the
sword
and
my
brother
hugh
i
will
tell
on
another
time
said
he
rising
swallow
the
great
horse
cantered
up
from
the
far
end
of
the
meadow
close
to
mother
they
heard
mother
say

into
the
meadow

bank

the
afternoon
and
they
honestly
believed
that

that
puck
had
slyly
thrown
into
their
laps

two
things

love

first
and
death

the
second
and
love
in
england
hath
taken
me
the
knights
of
the
joyous
venture
harp
song
of
the
dane
women
what
is
a
woman
that
you
forsake
her
and
the
and
the
to
go
with
the
old
grey
she
has
no
house
to
lay
a
guest
in
but
one
chill
bed
for
all
to
rest
in
that
the
pale
suns
and
the
stray
bergs
nest
in
she
has
no
strong
white
arms
to
fold
you
but
the
weed
to
hold
you
bound
on
the
rocks
where
the
tide
has
rolled
you
yet
when
the
signs
of
summer
thicken
and
the
ice
breaks
and
the
quicken
yearly
you
turn
from
our
side
and
sicken
sicken
again
for
the
shouts
and
the
slaughters
and
steal
away
to
the
lapping
waters
and
look
at
your
ship
in
her
winter
quarters
you
forget
our
mirth
and
talk
at
the
tables
the
kine
in
the
shed
and
the
horse
in
the
stables
to
pitch
her
sides
and
go
over
her
cables
then
you
drive
out
where
the
swallow
and
the
sound
of
your
falling
hollow
is
all
we
have
left
through
the
months
to
follow
ah
what
is
a
woman
that
you
forsake
her
and
the
and
the
to
go
with
the
old
grey
it
was
too
hot
to
run
about
in
the
open
so
dan
asked
their
friend
old
hobden
to
take
their
own
dinghy
from
the
pond
and
put
her
on
the
brook
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
her
painted
name
was
the
daisy
but
for
exploring
expeditions
she
was
the
golden
hind
or
the
long
serpent
or
some
such
suitable
name
dan
hiked
and
howked
with
a
the
brook
was
too
narrow
for
sculls
and
una
punted
with
a
piece
of
when
they
came
to
a
very
shallow
place
the
golden
hind
drew
quite
three
inches
of
water
they
disembarked
and
scuffled
her
over
the
gravel
by
her
and
when
they
reached
the
overgrown
banks
beyond
the
garden
they
pulled
themselves
upstream
by
the
low
branches
that
day
they
intended
to
discover
the
north
cape
like
the
old
in
the
book
of
verses
which
una
had
brought
with
her
but
on
account
of
the
heat
they
changed
it
to
a
voyage
up
the
amazon
and
the
sources
of
the
nile
even
on
the
shaded
water
the
air
was
hot
and
heavy
with
drowsy
scents
while
outside
through
breaks
in
the
trees
the
sunshine
burned
the
pasture
like
fire
the
kingfisher
was
asleep
on
his
and
the
blackbirds
scarcely
took
the
trouble
to
dive
into
the
next
bush
dragonflies
wheeling
and
clashing
were
the
only
things
at
work
except
the
moorhens
and
a
big
red
admiral
who
flapped
down
out
of
the
sunshine
for
a
drink
when
they
reached
otter
pool
the
golden
hind
grounded
comfortably
on
a
shallow
and
they
lay
beneath
a
roof
of
close
green
watching
the
water
trickle
over
the
down
the
mossy
brick
chute
from
the
to
the
brook
a
big
trout
the
children
knew
him
well
rolled
head
and
shoulders
at
some
fly
that
sailed
round
the
bend
while
once
in
just
so
often
the
brook
rose
a
fraction
of
an
inch
against
all
the
wet
pebbles
and
they
watched
the
slow
draw
and
shiver
of
a
breath
of
air
through
the
then
the
little
voices
of
the
slipping
water
began
again
like
the
shadows
talking
is
it
said
una
she
had
given
up
trying
to
read
dan
lay
over
the
bows
trailing
his
hands
in
the
current
they
heard
feet
on
the
that
runs
half
across
the
pool
and
saw
sir
richard
dalyngridge
standing
over
them
yours
a
dangerous
voyage
he
asked
smiling
bumped
a
lot
sir
said
dan
hardly
any
water
this
summer
the
brook
was
deeper
and
wider
when
my
children
played
at
danish
pirates
are
you
no
we
gave
up
being
pirates
years
ago
una
nearly
always
explorers
now
sailing
round
the
world
you
know
said
sir
richard
he
sat
him
in
the
comfortable
crotch
of
an
old
on
the
bank
can
it
be
round
it
in
your
books
dan
suggested
he
had
been
doing
geography
at
his
last
lesson
can
neither
write
nor
read
he
replied
thou
read
child
said
dan
the
very
long
words
read
to
me
that
i
may
hear
for
myself
dan
flushed
but
opened
the
book
and
began
gabbling
a
little
at
discoverer
of
the
north
cape
the
old
who
dwelt
in
helgoland
to
king
alfred
the
lover
of
truth
brought
a
which
he
held
in
his
brown
right
hand
but
this
i
know
this
is
an
old
song
this
i
have
heard
sung
this
is
a
miracle
sir
richard
interrupted
do
not
stop
he
leaned
forward
and
the
shadows
of
the
leaves
slipped
and
slid
upon
his
ploughed
the
land
with
horses
but
my
heart
was
ill
at
ease
for
the
old
seafaring
men
came
to
me
now
and
then
with
their
sagas
of
the
seas
his
hand
fell
on
the
hilt
of
the
great
sword
is
truth
he
cried
so
did
it
happen
to
me
and
he
beat
time
delightedly
to
the
tramp
of
verse
after
verse
now
the
land
said
othere
bent
southward
suddenly
and
i
followed
the
curving
shore
and
ever
southward
bore
into
a
nameless
sea
nameless
sea
he
repeated
did
i
so
did
hugh
and
i
did
you
go
tell
us
said
una
let
me
hear
all
first
so
dan
read
to
the
poem
very
end
said
the
knight
is
othere
tale
even
so
i
have
heard
the
men
in
the
dane
ships
sing
it
not
those
same
valiant
words
but
something
like
to
them
you
ever
explored
north
dan
shut
the
book
my
venture
was
south
farther
south
than
any
man
has
fared
hugh
and
i
went
down
with
witta
and
his
heathen
he
jerked
the
tall
sword
forward
and
leaned
on
it
with
both
hands
but
his
eyes
looked
long
past
them
thought
you
always
lived
here
said
una
timidly
while
my
lady
aelueva
lived
but
she
died
she
died
then
my
eldest
son
being
a
man
i
asked
de
aquila
leave
that
he
should
hold
the
manor
while
i
went
on
some
journey
or
pilgrimage
to
forget
de
aquila
whom
the
second
william
had
made
warden
of
pevensey
in
earl
mortain
place
was
very
old
then
but
still
he
rode
his
tall
roan
horses
and
in
the
saddle
he
looked
like
a
little
white
falcon
when
hugh
at
dallington
over
yonder
heard
what
i
did
he
sent
for
my
second
son
whom
being
unmarried
he
had
ever
looked
upon
as
his
own
child
and
by
de
aquila
leave
gave
him
the
manor
of
dallington
to
hold
till
he
should
return
then
hugh
came
with
me
did
this
happen
said
dan
i
can
answer
to
the
very
day
for
as
we
rode
with
de
aquila
by
pevensey
have
i
said
that
he
was
lord
of
pevensey
and
of
the
honour
of
the
eagle
the
bordeaux
ship
that
fetched
him
his
wines
yearly
out
of
france
a
marsh
man
ran
to
us
crying
that
he
had
seen
a
great
black
goat
which
bore
on
his
back
the
body
of
the
king
and
that
the
goat
had
spoken
to
him
on
that
same
day
red
william
our
king
the
son
died
of
a
secret
arrow
while
he
hunted
in
a
forest
this
is
a
cross
matter
said
de
aquila
to
meet
on
the
threshold
of
a
journey
if
red
william
be
dead
i
may
have
to
fight
for
my
lands
wait
a
little
lady
being
dead
i
cared
nothing
for
signs
and
omens
nor
hugh
either
we
took
that
to
go
to
bordeaux
but
the
wind
failed
while
we
were
yet
in
sight
of
pevensey
a
thick
mist
hid
us
and
we
drifted
with
the
tide
along
the
cliffs
to
the
west
our
company
was
for
the
most
part
merchants
returning
to
france
and
we
were
laden
with
wool
and
there
were
three
couple
of
tall
chained
to
the
rail
their
master
was
a
knight
of
artois
his
name
i
never
learned
but
his
shield
bore
gold
pieces
on
a
red
ground
and
he
limped
much
as
i
do
from
a
wound
which
he
had
got
in
his
youth
at
mantes
siege
he
served
the
duke
of
burgundy
against
the
moors
in
spain
and
was
returning
to
that
war
with
his
dogs
he
sang
us
strange
moorish
songs
that
first
night
and
half
persuaded
us
to
go
with
him
i
was
on
pilgrimage
to
forget
which
is
what
no
pilgrimage
brings
i
think
i
would
have
gone
but
you
how
the
life
and
fortune
of
man
changes
towards
morning
a
dane
ship
rowing
silently
struck
against
us
in
the
mist
and
while
we
rolled
hither
and
yon
hugh
leaning
over
the
rail
fell
outboard
i
leaped
after
him
and
we
two
tumbled
aboard
the
dane
and
were
caught
and
bound
ere
we
could
rise
our
own
ship
was
swallowed
up
in
the
mist
i
judge
the
knight
of
the
gold
pieces
muzzled
his
dogs
with
his
cloak
lest
they
should
give
tongue
and
betray
the
merchants
for
i
heard
their
baying
suddenly
stop
lay
bound
among
the
benches
till
morning
when
the
danes
dragged
us
to
the
high
deck
by
the
and
their
captain
witta
he
was
called
turned
us
over
with
his
foot
bracelets
of
gold
from
elbow
to
armpit
he
wore
and
his
red
hair
was
long
as
a
woman
and
came
down
in
plaited
locks
on
his
shoulder
he
was
stout
with
bowed
legs
and
long
arms
he
spoiled
us
of
all
we
had
but
when
he
laid
hand
on
hugh
sword
and
saw
the
runes
on
the
blade
hastily
he
thrust
it
back
yet
his
covetousness
overcame
him
and
he
tried
again
and
again
and
the
third
time
the
sword
sang
loud
and
angrily
so
that
the
rowers
leaned
on
their
oars
to
listen
here
they
all
spoke
together
screaming
like
gulls
and
a
yellow
man
such
as
i
have
never
seen
came
to
the
high
deck
and
cut
our
bonds
he
was
yellow
not
from
sickness
but
by
nature
yellow
as
honey
and
his
eyes
stood
endwise
in
his
head
do
you
mean
said
una
her
chin
on
her
hand
said
sir
richard
he
put
a
finger
to
the
corner
of
each
eye
and
pushed
it
up
till
his
eyes
narrowed
to
slits
you
look
just
like
a
chinaman
cried
dan
the
man
a
chinaman
know
not
what
that
may
be
witta
had
found
him
half
dead
among
ice
on
the
shores
of
muscovy
we
thought
he
was
a
devil
he
crawled
before
us
and
brought
food
in
a
silver
dish
which
these
had
robbed
from
some
rich
abbey
and
witta
with
his
own
hands
gave
us
wine
he
spoke
a
little
in
french
a
little
in
south
saxon
and
much
in
the
northman
tongue
we
asked
him
to
set
us
ashore
promising
to
pay
him
better
ransom
than
he
would
get
price
if
he
sold
us
to
the
moors
as
once
befell
a
knight
of
my
acquaintance
sailing
from
flushing
by
my
father
guthrum
head
said
he
the
gods
sent
ye
into
my
ship
for
a
this
i
quaked
for
i
knew
it
was
still
the
danes
custom
to
sacrifice
captives
to
their
gods
for
fair
weather
plague
on
thy
four
long
bones
said
hugh
what
profit
canst
thou
make
of
poor
old
pilgrims
that
can
neither
work
nor
fight
forbid
i
should
fight
against
thee
poor
pilgrim
with
the
singing
sword
said
he
come
with
us
and
be
poor
no
more
thy
teeth
are
far
apart
which
is
a
sure
sign
thou
wilt
travel
and
grow
rich
if
we
will
not
come
said
hugh
to
england
or
france
said
witta
we
are
midway
between
the
two
unless
ye
choose
to
drown
yourselves
no
hair
of
your
head
will
be
harmed
here
aboard
we
think
ye
bring
us
luck
and
i
myself
know
the
runes
on
that
sword
are
good
he
turned
and
bade
them
hoist
sail
all
made
way
for
us
as
we
walked
about
the
ship
and
the
ship
was
full
of
wonders
was
she
like
said
dan
low
and
narrow
bearing
one
mast
with
a
red
sail
and
rowed
by
fifteen
oars
a
side
the
knight
answered
her
bows
was
a
deck
under
which
men
might
lie
and
at
her
stern
another
shut
off
by
a
painted
door
from
the
rowers
benches
here
hugh
and
i
slept
with
witta
and
the
yellow
man
upon
tapestries
as
soft
as
wool
i
remember
he
laughed
to
himself
first
we
entered
there
a
loud
voice
cried
out
swords
out
swords
kill
kill
seeing
us
start
witta
laughed
and
showed
us
it
was
but
a
grey
bird
with
a
red
tail
he
sat
her
on
his
shoulder
and
she
called
for
bread
and
wine
hoarsely
and
prayed
him
to
kiss
her
yet
she
was
no
more
than
a
silly
bird
but
ye
knew
this
he
looked
at
their
smiling
faces
were
laughing
at
you
said
una
must
have
been
a
parrot
it
just
what
pollies
do
we
learned
later
but
here
is
another
marvel
the
yellow
man
whose
name
was
kitai
had
with
him
a
brown
box
in
the
box
was
a
blue
bowl
with
red
marks
upon
the
rim
and
within
the
bowl
hanging
from
a
fine
thread
was
a
piece
of
iron
no
thicker
than
that
grass
stem
and
as
long
maybe
as
my
spur
but
straight
in
this
iron
said
witta
abode
an
evil
spirit
which
kitai
the
yellow
man
had
brought
by
art
magic
out
of
his
own
country
that
lay
three
years
journey
southward
the
evil
spirit
strove
day
and
night
to
return
to
his
country
and
therefore
look
you
the
iron
needle
pointed
continually
to
the
south
said
dan
suddenly
and
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
my
own
eyes
i
saw
it
every
day
and
all
day
long
though
the
ship
rolled
though
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
were
hid
this
blind
spirit
in
the
iron
knew
whither
it
would
go
and
strained
to
the
south
witta
called
it
the
wise
iron
because
it
showed
him
his
way
across
the
unknowable
seas
again
sir
richard
looked
keenly
at
the
children
think
ye
was
it
sorcery
it
anything
like
this
dan
fished
out
his
old
brass
that
generally
lived
with
his
knife
and
glass
has
got
cracked
but
the
needle
waggles
all
right
sir
the
knight
drew
a
long
breath
of
wonder
yes
the
wise
iron
shook
and
swung
in
just
this
fashion
now
it
is
still
now
it
points
to
the
south
said
dan
south
there
is
the
south
sir
richard
then
they
both
laughed
for
naturally
when
one
end
of
a
straight
points
to
the
north
the
other
must
point
to
the
south
said
sir
richard
clicking
his
tongue
can
be
no
sorcery
if
a
child
carries
it
wherefore
does
it
point
south
or
north
says
that
nobody
knows
said
una
sir
richard
looked
relieved
it
may
still
be
magic
it
was
magic
to
us
and
so
we
voyaged
when
the
wind
served
we
hoisted
sail
and
lay
all
up
along
the
windward
rail
our
shields
on
our
backs
to
break
the
spray
when
it
failed
they
rowed
with
long
oars
the
yellow
man
sat
by
the
wise
iron
and
witta
steered
at
first
i
feared
the
great
waves
but
as
i
saw
how
wisely
witta
led
his
ship
among
them
i
grew
bolder
hugh
liked
it
well
from
the
first
my
skill
is
not
upon
the
water
and
rocks
and
whirlpools
such
as
we
saw
by
the
west
isles
of
france
where
an
oar
caught
on
a
rock
and
broke
are
much
against
my
stomach
we
sailed
south
across
a
stormy
sea
where
by
moonlight
between
clouds
we
saw
a
flanders
ship
roll
clean
over
and
sink
again
though
hugh
laboured
with
witta
all
night
i
lay
under
the
deck
with
the
talking
bird
and
cared
not
whether
i
lived
or
died
there
is
a
sickness
of
the
sea
which
for
three
days
is
pure
death
when
we
next
saw
land
witta
said
it
was
spain
and
we
stood
out
to
sea
that
coast
was
full
of
ships
busy
in
the
duke
war
against
the
moors
and
we
feared
to
be
hanged
by
the
duke
men
or
sold
into
slavery
by
the
moors
so
we
put
into
a
small
harbour
which
witta
knew
at
night
men
came
down
with
loaded
mules
and
witta
exchanged
amber
out
of
the
north
against
little
wedges
of
iron
and
packets
of
beads
in
earthen
pots
the
pots
he
put
under
the
decks
and
the
wedges
of
iron
he
laid
on
the
bottom
of
the
ship
after
he
had
cast
out
the
stones
and
shingle
which
till
then
had
been
our
ballast
wine
too
he
bought
for
lumps
of
grey
amber
a
little
morsel
no
bigger
than
a
purchased
a
cask
of
wine
but
i
speak
like
a
merchant
no
tell
us
what
you
had
to
eat
cried
dan
dried
in
the
sun
and
dried
fish
and
ground
beans
witta
took
in
and
corded
frails
of
a
certain
sweet
soft
fruit
which
the
moors
use
which
is
like
paste
of
figs
but
with
thin
long
stones
aha
dates
is
the
name
said
witta
when
the
ship
was
loaded
i
counsel
you
strangers
to
pray
to
your
gods
for
from
here
on
our
road
is
no
man
road
he
and
his
men
killed
a
black
goat
for
sacrifice
on
the
bows
and
the
yellow
man
brought
out
a
small
smiling
image
of
stone
and
burned
incense
before
it
hugh
and
i
commended
ourselves
to
god
and
saint
barnabas
and
our
lady
of
the
assumption
who
was
specially
dear
to
my
lady
we
were
not
young
but
i
think
no
shame
to
say
whenas
we
drove
out
of
that
secret
harbour
at
sunrise
over
a
still
sea
we
two
rejoiced
and
sang
as
did
the
knights
of
old
when
they
followed
our
great
duke
to
england
yet
was
our
leader
an
heathen
pirate
all
our
proud
fleet
but
one
galley
perilously
overloaded
for
guidance
we
leaned
on
a
pagan
sorcerer
and
our
port
was
beyond
the
world
end
witta
told
us
that
his
father
guthrum
had
once
in
his
life
rowed
along
the
shores
of
africa
to
a
land
where
naked
men
sold
gold
for
iron
and
beads
there
had
he
bought
much
gold
and
no
few
elephants
teeth
and
thither
by
help
of
the
wise
iron
would
witta
go
witta
feared
nothing
except
to
be
poor
father
told
me
said
witta
that
a
great
shoal
runs
three
sail
out
from
that
land
and
south
of
the
shoal
lies
a
forest
which
grows
in
the
sea
south
and
east
of
the
forest
my
father
came
to
a
place
where
the
men
hid
gold
in
their
hair
but
all
that
country
he
said
was
full
of
devils
who
lived
in
trees
and
tore
folk
limb
from
limb
how
think
ye
or
no
gold
said
hugh
fingering
his
sword
it
is
a
joyous
venture
have
at
these
devils
of
thine
witta
said
witta
sourly
i
am
only
a
poor
i
do
not
set
my
life
adrift
on
a
plank
for
joy
or
the
venture
once
i
beach
ship
again
at
stavanger
and
feel
the
wife
arms
round
my
neck
seek
no
more
ventures
a
ship
is
heavier
care
than
a
wife
or
cattle
leaped
down
among
the
rowers
chiding
them
for
their
little
strength
and
their
great
stomachs
yet
witta
was
a
wolf
in
fight
and
a
very
fox
in
cunning
were
driven
south
by
a
storm
and
for
three
days
and
three
nights
he
took
the
and
threddled
the
longship
through
the
sea
when
it
rose
beyond
measure
he
brake
a
pot
of
whale
oil
upon
the
water
which
wonderfully
smoothed
it
and
in
that
anointed
patch
he
turned
her
head
to
the
wind
and
threw
out
oars
at
the
end
of
a
rope
to
make
he
said
an
anchor
at
which
we
lay
rolling
sorely
but
dry
this
craft
his
father
guthrum
had
shown
him
he
knew
too
all
the
of
bald
who
was
a
wise
doctor
and
he
knew
the
of
hlaf
the
woman
who
robbed
egypt
he
knew
all
the
care
of
a
ship
the
storm
we
saw
a
mountain
whose
top
was
covered
with
snow
and
pierced
the
clouds
the
grasses
under
this
mountain
boiled
and
eaten
are
a
good
cure
for
soreness
of
the
gums
and
swelled
ankles
we
lay
there
eight
days
till
men
in
skins
threw
stones
at
us
when
the
heat
increased
witta
spread
a
cloth
on
bent
sticks
above
the
rowers
for
the
wind
failed
between
the
island
of
the
mountain
and
the
shore
of
africa
which
is
east
of
it
that
shore
is
sandy
and
we
rowed
along
it
within
three
bowshots
here
we
saw
whales
and
fish
in
the
shape
of
shields
but
longer
than
our
ship
some
slept
some
opened
their
mouths
at
us
and
some
danced
on
the
hot
waters
the
water
was
hot
to
the
hand
and
the
sky
was
hidden
by
hot
grey
mists
out
of
which
blew
a
fine
dust
that
whitened
our
hair
and
beards
of
a
morning
here
too
were
fish
that
flew
in
the
air
like
birds
they
would
fall
on
the
laps
of
the
rowers
and
when
we
went
ashore
we
would
roast
and
eat
them
the
knight
paused
to
see
if
the
children
doubted
him
but
they
only
nodded
and
said
on
yellow
land
lay
on
our
left
the
grey
sea
on
our
right
knight
though
i
was
i
pulled
my
oar
amongst
the
rowers
i
caught
seaweed
and
dried
it
and
stuffed
it
between
the
pots
of
beads
lest
they
should
break
knighthood
is
for
the
land
at
sea
look
you
a
man
is
but
a
spurless
rider
on
a
bridleless
horse
i
learned
to
make
strong
knots
in
ropes
yes
and
to
join
two
ropes
end
to
end
so
that
even
witta
could
scarcely
see
where
they
had
been
married
but
hugh
had
tenfold
more
than
witta
gave
him
charge
of
the
rowers
of
the
left
side
thorkild
of
borkum
a
man
with
a
broken
nose
that
wore
a
norman
steel
cap
had
the
rowers
of
the
right
and
each
side
rowed
and
sang
against
the
other
they
saw
that
no
man
was
idle
truly
as
hugh
said
and
witta
would
laugh
at
him
a
ship
is
all
more
care
than
a
manor
thus
there
was
water
to
fetch
from
the
shore
when
we
could
find
it
as
well
as
wild
fruit
and
grasses
and
sand
for
scrubbing
of
the
decks
and
benches
to
keep
them
sweet
also
we
hauled
the
ship
out
on
low
islands
and
emptied
all
her
gear
even
to
the
iron
wedges
and
burned
off
the
weed
that
had
grown
on
her
with
torches
of
rush
and
smoked
below
the
decks
with
rushes
dampened
in
salt
water
as
hlaf
the
woman
orders
in
her
once
when
we
were
thus
stripped
and
the
ship
lay
propped
on
her
keel
the
bird
cried
out
swords
as
though
she
saw
an
enemy
witta
vowed
he
would
wring
her
neck
polly
did
he
said
una
she
was
the
ship
bird
she
could
call
all
the
rowers
by
name
those
were
good
days
for
a
wifeless
man
with
witta
and
his
heathen
beyond
the
world
end
after
many
weeks
we
came
on
the
great
shoal
which
stretched
as
witta
father
had
said
far
out
to
sea
we
skirted
it
till
we
were
giddy
with
the
sight
and
dizzy
with
the
sound
of
bars
and
breakers
and
when
we
reached
land
again
we
found
a
naked
black
people
dwelling
among
woods
who
for
one
wedge
of
iron
loaded
us
with
fruits
and
grasses
and
eggs
witta
scratched
his
head
at
them
in
sign
he
would
buy
gold
they
had
no
gold
but
they
understood
the
sign
all
the
hide
their
gold
in
their
thick
hair
for
they
pointed
along
the
coast
they
beat
too
on
their
chests
with
their
clenched
hands
and
that
if
we
had
known
it
was
an
evil
sign
did
it
mean
said
dan
ye
shall
hear
we
followed
the
coast
eastward
sixteen
days
counting
time
by
on
the
till
we
came
to
the
forest
in
the
sea
trees
grew
there
out
of
mud
arched
upon
lean
and
high
roots
and
many
muddy
waterways
ran
allwhither
into
darkness
under
the
trees
here
we
lost
the
sun
we
followed
the
winding
channels
between
the
trees
and
where
we
could
not
row
we
laid
hold
of
the
crusted
roots
and
hauled
ourselves
along
the
water
was
foul
and
great
glittering
flies
tormented
us
morning
and
evening
a
blue
mist
covered
the
mud
which
bred
fevers
four
of
our
rowers
sickened
and
were
bound
to
their
benches
lest
they
should
leap
overboard
and
be
eaten
by
the
monsters
of
the
mud
the
yellow
man
lay
sick
beside
the
wise
iron
rolling
his
head
and
talking
in
his
own
tongue
only
the
bird
throve
she
sat
on
witta
shoulder
and
screamed
in
that
noisome
silent
darkness
yes
i
think
it
was
the
silence
we
most
feared
he
paused
to
listen
to
the
comfortable
home
noises
of
the
brook
we
had
lost
count
of
time
among
those
black
gullies
and
swashes
we
heard
as
it
were
a
drum
beat
far
off
and
following
it
we
broke
into
a
broad
brown
river
by
a
hut
in
a
clearing
among
fields
of
pumpkins
we
thanked
god
to
see
the
sun
again
the
people
of
the
village
gave
the
good
welcome
and
witta
scratched
his
head
at
them
for
gold
and
showed
them
our
iron
and
beads
they
ran
to
the
bank
we
were
still
in
the
ship
and
pointed
to
our
swords
and
bows
for
always
when
near
shore
we
lay
armed
soon
they
fetched
store
of
gold
in
bars
and
in
dust
from
their
huts
and
some
great
blackened
elephants
teeth
these
they
piled
on
the
bank
as
though
to
tempt
us
and
made
signs
of
dealing
blows
in
battle
and
pointed
up
to
the
and
to
the
forest
behind
their
captain
or
chief
sorcerer
then
beat
on
his
chest
with
his
fists
and
gnashed
his
teeth
thorkild
of
borkum
do
they
mean
we
must
fight
for
all
this
gear
and
he
half
drew
sword
said
hugh
i
think
they
ask
us
to
league
against
some
enemy
like
this
not
said
witta
of
a
sudden
back
into
we
did
and
sat
still
all
watching
the
black
folk
and
the
gold
they
piled
on
the
bank
again
we
heard
drums
beat
in
the
forest
and
the
people
fled
to
their
huts
leaving
the
gold
unguarded
hugh
at
the
bows
pointed
without
speech
and
we
saw
a
great
devil
come
out
of
the
forest
he
shaded
his
brows
with
his
hand
and
moistened
his
pink
tongue
between
his
lips
thus
devil
said
dan
delightfully
horrified
taller
than
a
man
covered
with
reddish
hair
when
he
had
well
regarded
our
ship
he
beat
on
his
chest
with
his
fists
till
it
sounded
like
rolling
drums
and
came
to
the
bank
swinging
all
his
body
between
his
long
arms
and
gnashed
his
teeth
at
us
hugh
loosed
arrow
and
pierced
him
through
the
throat
he
fell
roaring
and
three
other
devils
ran
out
of
the
forest
and
hauled
him
into
a
tall
tree
out
of
sight
anon
they
cast
down
the
arrow
and
lamented
together
among
the
leaves
witta
saw
the
gold
on
the
bank
he
was
loath
to
leave
it
sirs
said
he
no
man
had
spoken
till
then
yonder
is
what
we
have
come
so
far
and
so
painfully
to
find
laid
out
to
our
very
hand
let
us
row
in
while
these
devils
bewail
themselves
and
at
least
bear
off
what
we
may
as
a
wolf
cunning
as
a
fox
was
witta
he
set
four
archers
on
the
to
shoot
the
devils
if
they
should
leap
from
the
tree
which
was
close
to
the
bank
he
manned
ten
oars
a
side
and
bade
them
watch
his
hand
to
row
in
or
back
out
and
so
coaxed
he
them
toward
the
bank
but
none
would
set
foot
ashore
though
the
gold
was
within
ten
paces
no
man
is
hasty
to
his
hanging
they
whimpered
at
their
oars
like
beaten
hounds
and
witta
bit
his
fingers
for
rage
hugh
of
a
sudden
hark
at
first
we
thought
it
was
the
buzzing
of
the
glittering
flies
on
the
water
but
it
grew
loud
and
fierce
so
that
all
men
heard
said
dan
and
una
was
the
sword
sir
richard
patted
the
smooth
hilt
sang
as
a
dane
sings
before
battle
i
go
said
hugh
and
he
leaped
from
the
bows
and
fell
among
the
gold
i
was
afraid
to
my
four
bones
marrow
but
for
shame
sake
i
followed
and
thorkild
of
borkum
leaped
after
me
none
other
came
blame
me
not
cried
witta
behind
us
i
must
abide
by
my
ship
we
three
had
no
time
to
blame
or
praise
we
stooped
to
the
gold
and
threw
it
back
over
our
shoulders
one
hand
on
our
swords
and
one
eye
on
the
tree
which
nigh
overhung
us
know
not
how
the
devils
leaped
down
or
how
the
fight
began
i
heard
hugh
cry
out
out
as
though
he
were
at
santlache
again
i
saw
thorkild
steel
cap
smitten
off
his
head
by
a
great
hairy
hand
and
i
felt
an
arrow
from
the
ship
whistle
past
my
ear
they
say
that
till
witta
took
his
sword
to
the
rowers
he
could
not
bring
his
ship
inshore
and
each
one
of
the
four
archers
said
afterwards
that
he
alone
had
pierced
the
devil
that
fought
me
i
do
not
know
i
went
to
it
in
my
which
saved
my
skin
with
and
i
fought
for
the
life
against
a
devil
whose
very
feet
were
hands
and
who
whirled
me
back
and
forth
like
a
dead
branch
he
had
me
by
the
waist
my
arms
to
my
side
when
an
arrow
from
the
ship
pierced
him
between
the
shoulders
and
he
loosened
grip
i
passed
my
sword
twice
through
him
and
he
crutched
himself
away
between
his
long
arms
coughing
and
moaning
next
as
i
remember
i
saw
thorkild
of
borkum
and
smiling
leaping
up
and
down
before
a
devil
that
leaped
and
gnashed
his
teeth
then
hugh
passed
his
sword
shifted
to
his
left
hand
and
i
wondered
why
i
had
not
known
that
hugh
was
a
man
and
thereafter
i
remembered
nothing
till
i
felt
spray
on
my
face
and
we
were
in
sunshine
on
the
open
sea
that
was
twenty
days
after
had
happened
did
hugh
die
children
asked
was
such
a
fight
fought
by
christened
man
said
sir
richard
arrow
from
the
ship
had
saved
me
from
my
devil
and
thorkild
of
borkum
had
given
back
before
his
devil
till
the
bowmen
on
the
ship
could
shoot
it
all
full
of
arrows
from
near
by
but
hugh
devil
was
cunning
and
had
kept
behind
trees
where
no
arrow
could
reach
body
to
body
there
by
stark
strength
of
sword
and
hand
had
hugh
slain
him
and
dying
the
thing
had
clenched
his
teeth
on
the
sword
judge
what
teeth
they
were
sir
richard
turned
the
sword
again
that
the
children
might
see
the
two
great
chiselled
gouges
on
either
side
of
the
blade
same
teeth
met
in
hugh
right
arm
and
side
sir
richard
went
on
oh
i
had
no
more
than
a
broken
foot
and
a
fever
ear
was
bitten
but
hugh
arm
and
side
clean
withered
away
i
saw
him
where
he
lay
along
sucking
a
fruit
in
his
left
hand
his
flesh
was
wasted
off
his
bones
his
hair
was
patched
with
white
and
his
hand
was
like
a
woman
he
put
his
left
arm
round
my
neck
and
whispered
take
my
sword
it
has
been
thine
since
hastings
o
my
brother
but
i
can
never
hold
hilt
again
we
lay
there
on
the
high
deck
talking
of
santlache
and
i
think
of
every
day
since
santlache
and
it
came
so
that
we
both
wept
i
was
weak
and
he
little
more
than
a
shadow
nay
said
witta
at
the
gold
is
a
good
right
arm
to
any
man
look
look
at
the
gold
he
bade
thorkild
show
us
the
gold
and
the
elephants
teeth
as
though
we
had
been
children
he
had
brought
away
all
the
gold
on
the
bank
and
twice
as
much
more
that
the
people
of
the
village
gave
him
for
slaying
the
devils
they
worshipped
us
as
gods
thorkild
told
me
it
was
one
of
their
old
women
healed
up
hugh
poor
arm
much
gold
did
you
get
dan
can
i
say
where
we
came
out
with
wedges
of
iron
under
the
rowers
feet
we
returned
with
wedges
of
gold
hidden
beneath
planks
there
was
dust
of
gold
in
packages
where
we
slept
and
along
the
side
and
under
the
benches
we
lashed
the
blackened
elephants
teeth
had
sooner
have
my
right
arm
said
hugh
when
he
had
seen
all
that
was
my
fault
said
witta
i
should
have
taken
ransom
and
landed
you
in
france
when
first
you
came
aboard
ten
months
ago
is
now
said
hugh
laughing
plucked
at
his
long
but
think
said
he
if
i
had
let
ye
go
which
i
swear
i
would
never
have
done
for
i
love
ye
more
than
brothers
if
i
had
let
ye
go
by
now
ye
might
have
been
horribly
slain
by
some
mere
moor
in
the
duke
of
burgundy
war
or
ye
might
have
been
murdered
by
or
ye
might
have
died
of
the
plague
at
an
inn
think
of
this
and
do
not
blame
me
overmuch
hugh
see
i
will
only
take
a
half
of
the
gold
blame
thee
not
at
all
witta
said
hugh
it
was
a
joyous
venture
and
we
here
have
done
what
never
men
have
done
if
i
live
till
england
i
will
build
me
a
stout
keep
over
dallington
out
of
my
share
will
buy
cattle
and
amber
and
warm
red
cloth
for
the
wife
said
witta
and
i
will
hold
all
the
land
at
the
head
of
stavanger
fiord
many
will
fight
for
me
now
but
first
we
must
turn
north
and
with
this
honest
treasure
aboard
i
pray
we
meet
no
pirate
ships
did
not
laugh
we
were
careful
we
were
afraid
lest
we
should
lose
one
grain
of
our
gold
for
which
we
had
fought
devils
is
the
sorcerer
said
i
for
witta
was
looking
at
the
wise
iron
in
the
box
and
i
could
not
see
the
yellow
man
has
gone
to
his
own
country
said
he
he
rose
up
in
the
night
while
we
were
beating
out
of
that
forest
in
the
mud
and
said
that
he
could
see
it
behind
the
trees
he
leaped
out
on
the
mud
and
did
not
answer
when
we
called
so
we
called
no
more
he
left
the
wise
iron
which
is
all
that
i
care
for
and
see
the
spirit
still
points
to
the
south
were
troubled
for
fear
that
the
wise
iron
should
fail
us
now
that
its
yellow
man
had
gone
and
when
we
saw
the
spirit
still
served
us
we
grew
afraid
of
too
strong
winds
and
of
shoals
and
of
careless
leaping
fish
and
of
all
the
people
on
all
the
shores
where
we
landed
said
dan
of
the
gold
because
of
our
gold
gold
changes
men
altogether
thorkild
of
borkum
did
not
change
he
laughed
at
witta
for
his
fears
and
at
us
for
our
counselling
witta
to
furl
sail
when
the
ship
pitched
at
all
be
drowned
out
of
hand
said
thorkild
of
borkum
than
go
tied
to
a
of
yellow
dust
was
a
landless
man
and
had
been
slave
to
some
king
in
the
east
he
would
have
beaten
out
the
gold
into
deep
bands
to
put
round
the
oars
and
round
the
prow
though
he
vexed
himself
for
the
gold
witta
waited
upon
hugh
like
a
woman
lending
him
his
shoulder
when
the
ship
rolled
and
tying
of
ropes
from
side
to
side
that
hugh
might
hold
by
them
but
for
hugh
he
said
and
so
did
all
his
men
they
would
never
have
won
the
gold
i
remember
witta
made
a
little
thin
gold
ring
for
our
bird
to
swing
in
months
we
rowed
and
sailed
and
went
ashore
for
fruits
or
to
clean
the
ship
when
we
saw
wild
horsemen
riding
among
flourishing
spears
we
knew
we
were
on
the
moors
coast
and
stood
over
north
to
spain
and
a
strong
wind
bore
us
in
ten
days
to
a
coast
of
high
red
rocks
where
we
heard
a
blow
among
the
yellow
gorse
and
knew
it
was
england
find
ye
pevensey
yourselves
said
witta
i
love
not
these
narrow
seas
set
the
dried
salted
head
of
the
devil
which
hugh
had
killed
high
on
our
prow
and
all
boats
fled
from
us
yet
for
our
gold
sake
we
were
more
afraid
than
they
we
crept
along
the
coast
by
night
till
we
came
to
the
chalk
cliffs
and
so
east
to
pevensey
witta
would
not
come
ashore
with
us
though
hugh
promised
him
wine
at
dallington
enough
to
swim
in
he
was
on
fire
to
see
his
wife
and
ran
into
the
marsh
after
sunset
and
there
he
left
us
and
our
share
of
gold
and
backed
out
on
the
same
tide
he
made
no
promise
he
swore
no
oath
he
looked
for
no
thanks
but
to
hugh
an
armless
man
and
to
me
an
old
cripple
whom
he
could
have
flung
into
the
sea
he
passed
over
wedge
upon
wedge
packet
upon
packet
of
gold
and
dust
of
gold
and
only
ceased
when
we
would
take
no
more
as
he
stooped
from
the
rail
to
bid
us
farewell
he
stripped
off
his
bracelets
and
put
them
all
on
hugh
left
and
he
kissed
hugh
on
the
cheek
i
think
when
thorkild
of
borkum
bade
the
rowers
give
way
we
were
near
weeping
it
is
true
that
witta
was
an
heathen
and
a
pirate
true
it
is
he
held
us
by
force
many
months
in
his
ship
but
i
loved
that
man
for
his
great
boldness
his
cunning
his
skill
and
beyond
all
for
his
simplicity
he
get
home
all
right
said
dan
never
knew
we
saw
him
hoist
sail
under
the
and
stand
away
i
have
prayed
that
he
found
his
wife
and
the
children
what
did
you
do
waited
on
the
marsh
till
the
day
then
i
sat
by
the
gold
all
tied
in
an
old
sail
while
hugh
went
to
pevensey
and
de
aquila
sent
us
horses
sir
richard
crossed
hands
on
his
and
stared
down
stream
through
the
soft
warm
shadows
whole
shipload
of
gold
said
una
looking
at
the
little
golden
hind
i
glad
i
did
see
the
devils
do
believe
they
were
devils
whispered
back
said
sir
richard
father
warned
him
they
were
unquestionable
devils
one
must
believe
one
father
and
not
children
what
were
my
devils
then
dan
flushed
all
over
i
only
thought
he
stammered
got
a
book
called
the
gorilla
hunters
it
a
continuation
of
coral
island
sir
and
it
says
there
that
the
gorillas
they
big
monkeys
you
know
were
always
chewing
iron
up
always
said
una
twice
they
had
been
reading
the
gorilla
hunters
in
the
orchard
anyhow
they
always
drummed
on
their
chests
like
sir
did
before
they
went
for
people
and
they
built
houses
in
trees
too
sir
richard
opened
his
eyes
like
flat
nests
did
our
devils
make
where
their
imps
lay
and
looked
at
us
i
did
not
see
them
i
was
sick
after
the
fight
but
witta
told
me
and
lo
ye
know
it
also
wonderful
were
our
devils
only
apes
is
there

richard
went
on
in
an
undertone
concerns
de
aquila
than
whom
there
was
never
bolder
nor
craftier
nor
more
hardy
knight
born
and
remember
he
was
an
old
old
man
at
that
time
said
dan
we
came
back
from
sailing
with
witta
did
you
do
with
your
gold
said
dan
patience
link
by
link
is
made
i
will
tell
all
in
its
place
we
bore
the
gold
to
pevensey
on
horseback
three
loads
of
it
and
then
up
to
the
north
chamber
above
the
great
hall
of
pevensey
castle
where
de
aquila
lay
in
winter
he
sat
on
his
bed
like
a
little
white
falcon
turning
his
head
swiftly
from
one
to
the
other
as
we
told
our
tale
jehan
the
crab
an
old
sour
guarded
the
stairway
but
de
aquila
bade
him
wait
at
the
and
let
down
both
leather
curtains
over
the
door
it
was
jehan
whom
de
aquila
had
sent
to
us
with
the
horses
and
only
jehan
had
loaded
the
gold
when
our
story
was
told
de
aquila
gave
us
the
news
of
england
for
we
were
as
men
waked
from
a
sleep
the
red
king
was
dead
slain
ye
remember
the
day
we
set
sail
and
henry
his
younger
brother
had
made
himself
king
of
england
over
the
head
of
robert
of
normandy
this
was
the
very
thing
that
the
red
king
had
done
to
robert
when
our
great
william
died
then
robert
of
normandy
mad
as
de
aquila
said
at
twice
missing
of
this
kingdom
had
sent
an
army
against
england
which
army
had
been
well
beaten
back
to
their
ships
at
portsmouth
a
little
earlier
and
witta
ship
would
have
rowed
through
them
now
said
de
aquila
half
the
great
barons
of
the
north
and
west
are
out
against
the
king
between
salisbury
and
shrewsbury
and
half
the
other
half
wait
to
see
which
way
the
game
shall
go
they
say
henry
is
overly
english
for
their
stomachs
because
he
hath
married
an
english
wife
and
she
hath
coaxed
him
to
give
back
their
old
laws
to
our
saxons
better
ride
a
horse
on
the
bit
he
knows
i
say
but
that
is
only
a
cloak
to
their
falsehood
he
cracked
his
finger
on
the
table
where
the
wine
was
spilt
and
thus
he
spoke
crammed
us
norman
barons
full
of
good
english
acres
after
santlache
i
had
my
share
too
he
said
and
clapped
hugh
on
the
shoulder
but
i
warned
him
i
warned
him
before
odo
rebelled
that
he
should
have
bidden
the
barons
give
up
their
lands
and
lordships
in
normandy
if
they
would
be
english
lords
now
they
are
all
but
princes
both
in
england
and
normandy
hounds
with
a
foot
in
one
trough
and
both
eyes
on
the
other
robert
of
normandy
has
sent
them
word
that
if
they
do
not
fight
for
him
in
england
he
will
sack
and
harry
out
their
lands
in
normandy
therefore
clare
has
risen
fitzosborne
has
risen
montgomery
has
risen
whom
our
first
william
made
an
english
earl
even
is
out
with
his
men
whose
father
i
remember
a
little
knight
near
by
caen
if
henry
wins
the
barons
can
still
flee
to
normandy
where
robert
will
welcome
them
if
henry
loses
robert
he
says
will
give
them
more
lands
in
england
oh
a
pest
a
pest
on
normandy
for
she
will
be
our
england
curse
this
many
a
long
year
said
hugh
but
will
the
war
come
our
ways
think
you
from
the
north
said
de
aquila
but
the
sea
is
always
open
if
the
barons
gain
the
upper
hand
robert
will
send
another
army
into
england
for
sure
and
this
time
i
think
he
will
land
here
where
his
father
the
conqueror
landed
ye
have
brought
your
pigs
to
a
pretty
market
half
england
alight
and
gold
enough
on
the
ground
he
stamped
on
the
bars
beneath
the
table
to
set
every
sword
in
christendom
fighting
is
to
do
said
hugh
i
have
no
keep
at
dallington
and
if
we
buried
it
whom
could
we
trust
said
de
aquila
pevensey
walls
are
strong
no
man
but
jehan
who
is
my
dog
knows
what
is
between
them
he
drew
a
curtain
by
the
and
showed
us
the
shaft
of
a
well
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
made
it
for
a
he
said
but
we
found
salt
water
and
it
rises
and
falls
with
the
tide
hark
we
heard
the
water
whistle
and
blow
at
the
bottom
will
it
serve
said
he
must
said
hugh
our
lives
are
in
thy
hands
so
we
lowered
all
the
gold
down
except
one
small
chest
of
it
by
de
aquila
bed
which
we
kept
as
much
for
his
delight
in
its
weight
and
colour
as
for
any
of
our
needs
the
morning
ere
we
rode
to
our
manors
he
said
i
do
not
say
farewell
because
ye
will
return
and
bide
here
not
for
love
nor
for
sorrow
but
to
be
with
the
gold
have
a
care
he
said
laughing
lest
i
use
it
to
make
myself
pope
trust
me
not
but
return
sir
richard
paused
and
smiled
sadly
seven
days
then
we
returned
from
our
manors
from
the
manors
which
had
been
ours
were
the
children
quite
well
said
una
sons
were
young
land
and
governance
belong
by
right
to
young
men
sir
richard
was
talking
to
himself
would
have
broken
their
hearts
if
we
had
taken
back
our
manors
they
made
us
great
welcome
but
we
could
see
hugh
and
i
could
see
that
our
day
was
done
i
was
a
cripple
and
he
a
man
no
he
shook
his
head
therefore
he
raised
his
voice
rode
back
to
pevensey
sorry
said
una
for
the
knight
seemed
very
sorrowful
maid
it
all
passed
long
ago
they
were
young
we
were
old
we
let
them
rule
the
manors
aha
cried
de
aquila
from
his
when
we
dismounted
back
again
to
earth
old
foxes
but
when
we
were
in
his
chamber
above
the
hall
he
puts
his
arms
about
us
and
says
welcome
ghosts
welcome
poor
ghosts
thus
it
fell
out
that
we
were
rich
beyond
belief
and
lonely
and
lonely
did
you
do
said
dan
watched
for
robert
of
normandy
said
the
knight
aquila
was
like
witta
he
suffered
no
idleness
in
fair
weather
we
would
ride
along
between
bexlei
on
the
one
side
to
cuckmere
on
the
other
sometimes
with
hawk
sometimes
with
hound
there
are
stout
hares
both
on
the
marsh
and
the
downland
but
always
with
an
eye
to
the
sea
for
fear
of
fleets
from
normandy
in
foul
weather
he
would
walk
on
the
top
of
his
tower
frowning
against
the
rain
peering
here
and
pointing
there
it
always
vexed
him
to
think
how
witta
ship
had
come
and
gone
without
his
knowledge
when
the
wind
ceased
and
ships
anchored
to
the
wharf
edge
he
would
go
and
leaning
on
his
sword
among
the
stinking
fish
would
call
to
the
mariners
for
their
news
from
france
his
other
eye
he
kept
landward
for
word
of
henry
war
against
the
barons
brought
him
news
jongleurs
harpers
pedlars
sutlers
priests
and
the
like
and
though
he
was
secret
enough
in
small
things
yet
if
their
news
misliked
him
then
regarding
neither
time
nor
place
nor
people
he
would
curse
our
king
henry
for
a
fool
or
a
babe
i
have
heard
him
cry
aloud
by
the
fishing
boats
if
i
were
king
of
england
i
would
do
thus
and
thus
and
when
i
rode
out
to
see
that
the
were
laid
and
dry
he
hath
often
called
to
me
from
the
look
to
it
richard
do
not
copy
our
blind
king
but
see
with
thine
own
eyes
and
feel
with
thine
own
hands
i
do
not
think
he
knew
any
sort
of
fear
and
so
we
lived
at
pevensey
in
the
little
chamber
above
the
hall
foul
night
came
word
that
a
messenger
of
the
king
waited
below
we
were
chilled
after
a
long
riding
in
the
fog
towards
bexlei
which
is
an
easy
place
for
ships
to
land
de
aquila
sent
word
the
man
might
either
eat
with
us
or
wait
till
we
had
fed
anon
jehan
at
the
cried
that
he
had
called
for
horse
and
was
gone
pest
on
him
said
de
aquila
i
have
more
to
do
than
to
shiver
in
the
great
hall
for
every
gadling
the
king
sends
left
he
no
word
said
jehan
except
he
had
been
with
de
aquila
at
santlache
except
he
said
that
if
an
old
dog
could
not
learn
new
tricks
it
was
time
to
sweep
out
the
kennel
said
de
aquila
rubbing
his
nose
to
whom
did
he
say
that
his
beard
chiefly
but
some
to
his
horse
flank
as
he
was
girthing
up
i
followed
him
out
said
jehan
the
crab
was
his
horseshoes
on
black
said
the
crab
is
one
of
fulke
men
said
de
aquila
puck
broke
in
very
gently
horseshoes
on
black
is
not
the
shield
the
fulkes
arms
are
the
knight
waved
one
hand
statelily
knowest
that
evil
man
true
name
he
replied
i
have
chosen
to
call
him
fulke
because
i
promised
him
i
would
not
tell
the
story
of
his
wickedness
so
that
any
man
might
guess
it
i
have
changed
all
the
names
in
my
tale
his
children
children
may
be
still
alive
true
said
puck
smiling
softly
is
knightly
to
keep
faith
even
after
a
thousand
years
sir
richard
bowed
a
little
and
went
on
horseshoes
on
black
said
de
aquila
i
had
heard
fulke
had
joined
the
barons
but
if
this
is
true
our
king
must
be
of
the
upper
hand
no
matter
all
fulkes
are
faithless
still
i
would
not
have
sent
the
man
away
empty
fed
said
jehan
gilbert
the
clerk
fetched
him
meat
and
wine
from
the
kitchens
he
ate
at
gilbert
table
gilbert
was
a
clerk
from
battle
abbey
who
kept
the
accounts
of
the
manor
of
pevensey
he
was
tall
and
and
carried
those
beads
for
counting
of
prayers
they
were
large
brown
nuts
or
seeds
and
hanging
from
his
girdle
with
his
pen
and
they
clashed
when
he
walked
his
place
was
in
the
great
fireplace
there
was
his
table
of
accounts
and
there
he
lay
nights
he
feared
the
hounds
in
the
hall
that
came
nosing
after
bones
or
to
sleep
on
the
warm
ashes
and
would
slash
at
them
with
his
beads
like
a
woman
when
de
aquila
sat
in
hall
to
do
justice
take
fines
or
grant
lands
gilbert
would
so
write
it
in
the
but
it
was
none
of
his
work
to
feed
our
guests
or
to
let
them
depart
without
his
lord
knowledge
de
aquila
after
jehan
was
gone
down
the
stair
hugh
hast
thou
ever
told
my
gilbert
thou
canst
read
latin
said
hugh
he
is
no
friend
to
me
or
to
odo
my
hound
either
matter
said
de
aquila
let
him
never
know
thou
canst
tell
one
letter
from
its
fellow
and
there
he
yerked
us
in
the
ribs
with
his
scabbard
watch
him
both
of
ye
there
be
devils
in
africa
as
i
have
heard
but
by
the
saints
there
be
greater
devils
in
pevensey
and
that
was
all
he
would
say
chanced
some
small
while
afterwards
a
norman
would
wed
a
saxon
wench
of
the
manor
and
gilbert
we
had
watched
him
well
since
de
aquila
spoke
doubted
whether
her
folk
were
free
or
slave
since
de
aquila
would
give
them
a
field
of
good
land
if
she
were
free
the
matter
came
up
at
the
justice
in
great
hall
before
de
aquila
first
the
wench
father
spoke
then
her
mother
then
all
together
till
the
hall
rang
and
the
hounds
bayed
de
aquila
held
up
his
hands
write
her
free
he
called
to
gilbert
by
the
fireplace
a
name
write
her
free
before
she
deafens
me
yes
yes
he
said
to
the
wench
that
was
on
her
knees
at
him
thou
art
cerdic
sister
and
own
cousin
to
the
lady
of
mercia
if
thou
wilt
be
silent
in
fifty
years
there
will
be
neither
norman
nor
saxon
but
all
english
said
he
and
these
are
the
men
that
do
our
work
he
clapped
the
that
was
jehan
nephew
on
the
shoulder
and
kissed
the
wench
and
fretted
with
his
feet
among
the
rushes
to
show
it
was
finished
the
great
hall
is
always
bitter
cold
i
stood
at
his
side
hugh
was
behind
gilbert
in
the
fireplace
making
to
play
with
wise
rough
odo
he
signed
to
de
aquila
who
bade
gilbert
measure
the
new
field
for
the
new
couple
out
then
runs
our
gilbert
between
man
and
maid
his
beads
clashing
at
his
waist
and
the
hall
being
empty
we
three
sit
by
the
fire
hugh
leaning
down
to
the
hearthstones
i
saw
this
stone
move
under
gilbert
foot
when
odo
snuffed
at
it
look
de
aquila
digged
in
the
ashes
with
his
sword
the
stone
tilted
beneath
it
lay
a
parchment
folden
and
the
writing
atop
was
words
spoken
against
the
king
by
our
lord
of
pevensey
the
second
part
was
set
out
hugh
read
it
us
whispering
every
jest
de
aquila
had
made
to
us
touching
the
king
every
time
he
had
called
out
to
me
from
the
and
every
time
he
had
said
what
he
would
do
if
he
were
king
of
england
yes
day
by
day
had
his
daily
speech
which
he
never
stinted
been
set
down
by
gilbert
tricked
out
and
twisted
from
its
true
meaning
yet
withal
so
cunningly
that
none
could
deny
who
knew
him
that
de
aquila
had
in
some
sort
spoken
those
words
ye
see
dan
and
una
nodded
said
una
gravely
is
what
you
say
so
much
it
what
you
mean
when
you
say
it
like
calling
dan
a
beast
in
fun
only
do
always
understand
hath
done
this
day
by
day
before
our
very
face
said
de
aquila
hour
by
hour
said
hugh
when
de
aquila
spoke
even
now
in
the
hall
of
saxons
and
normans
i
saw
gilbert
write
on
a
parchment
which
he
kept
beside
the
that
de
aquila
said
soon
there
would
be
no
normans
left
in
england
if
his
did
their
work
aright
of
the
saints
said
de
aquila
what
avail
is
honour
or
a
sword
against
a
pen
where
did
gilbert
hide
that
writing
he
shall
eat
it
his
breast
when
he
ran
out
said
hugh
which
made
me
look
to
see
where
he
kept
his
finished
stuff
when
odo
scratched
at
this
stone
here
i
saw
his
face
change
so
i
was
sure
is
bold
said
de
aquila
do
him
justice
in
his
own
fashion
my
gilbert
is
bold
said
hugh
hearken
here
and
he
read
upon
the
feast
of
st
agatha
our
lord
of
pevensey
lying
in
his
upper
chamber
being
clothed
in
his
second
fur
gown
reversed
with
rabbit
on
him
he
is
not
my
said
de
aquila
and
hugh
and
i
laughed
with
rabbit
seeing
a
fog
over
the
marshes
did
wake
sir
richard
dalyngridge
his
drunken
here
they
laughed
at
me
and
said
out
old
fox
for
god
is
on
the
duke
of
normandy
side
did
i
it
was
a
black
fog
robert
could
have
landed
ten
thousand
men
and
we
none
the
wiser
does
he
tell
how
we
were
out
all
day
riding
the
marsh
and
how
i
near
perished
in
a
quicksand
and
coughed
like
a
sick
ewe
for
ten
days
after
cried
de
aquila
said
hugh
but
here
is
the
prayer
of
gilbert
himself
to
his
master
fulke
said
de
aquila
well
i
knew
it
was
fulke
what
is
the
price
of
my
blood
prayeth
that
when
our
lord
of
pevensey
is
stripped
of
his
lands
on
this
evidence
which
gilbert
hath
with
fear
and
pains
collected
and
pains
is
a
true
word
said
de
aquila
and
sucked
in
his
cheeks
but
how
excellent
a
weapon
is
a
pen
i
must
learn
it
prays
that
fulke
will
advance
him
from
his
present
service
to
that
honour
in
the
church
which
fulke
promised
him
and
lest
fulke
should
forget
he
has
written
below
be
sacristan
of
battle
this
de
aquila
whistled
a
man
who
can
plot
against
one
lord
can
plot
against
another
when
i
am
stripped
of
my
lands
fulke
will
whip
off
my
gilbert
foolish
head
none
the
less
battle
needs
a
new
sacristan
they
tell
me
the
abbot
henry
keeps
no
sort
of
rule
there
the
abbot
wait
said
hugh
it
is
our
heads
and
our
lands
that
are
in
danger
this
parchment
is
the
second
part
of
the
tale
the
first
has
gone
to
fulke
and
so
to
the
king
who
will
hold
us
traitors
assuredly
said
de
aquila
fulke
man
took
the
first
part
that
evening
when
gilbert
fed
him
and
our
king
is
so
beset
by
his
brother
and
his
barons
small
blame
too
that
he
is
mad
with
mistrust
fulke
has
his
ear
and
pours
poison
into
it
presently
the
king
gives
him
my
land
and
yours
this
is
old
and
he
leaned
back
and
yawned
thou
wilt
surrender
pevensey
without
word
or
blow
said
hugh
we
saxons
will
fight
your
king
then
i
will
go
warn
my
nephew
at
dallington
give
me
a
horse
thee
a
toy
and
a
rattle
said
de
aquila
put
back
the
parchment
and
rake
over
the
ashes
if
fulke
is
given
my
pevensey
which
is
england
gate
what
will
he
do
with
it
he
is
norman
at
heart
and
his
heart
is
in
normandy
where
he
can
kill
peasants
at
his
pleasure
he
will
open
england
gate
to
our
sleepy
robert
as
odo
and
mortain
tried
to
do
and
then
there
will
be
another
landing
and
another
santlache
therefore
i
can
not
give
up
pevensey
said
we
two
but
wait
if
my
king
be
made
on
gilbert
evidence
to
mistrust
me
he
will
send
his
men
against
me
here
and
while
we
fight
gate
is
left
unguarded
who
will
be
the
first
to
come
through
thereby
even
robert
of
normandy
therefore
i
can
not
fight
my
king
he
nursed
his
sword
thus
is
saying
and
unsaying
like
a
norman
said
hugh
what
of
our
manors
do
not
think
for
myself
said
de
aquila
nor
for
our
king
nor
for
your
lands
i
think
for
england
for
whom
neither
king
nor
baron
thinks
i
am
not
norman
sir
richard
nor
saxon
sir
hugh
english
am
i
norman
or
english
said
hugh
our
lives
are
thine
however
the
game
goes
when
do
we
hang
gilbert
said
de
aquila
who
knows
he
may
yet
be
sacristan
of
battle
for
to
do
him
justice
he
is
a
good
writer
dead
men
make
dumb
witnesses
wait
the
king
may
give
pevensey
to
fulke
and
our
manors
go
with
it
said
i
shall
we
tell
our
sons
the
king
will
not
wake
up
a
hornets
nest
in
the
south
till
he
has
smoked
out
the
bees
in
the
north
he
may
hold
me
a
traitor
but
at
least
he
sees
i
am
not
fighting
against
him
and
every
day
that
i
lie
still
is
so
much
gain
to
him
while
he
fights
the
barons
if
he
were
wise
he
would
wait
till
that
war
were
over
before
he
made
new
enemies
but
i
think
fulke
will
play
upon
him
to
send
for
me
and
if
i
do
not
obey
the
summons
that
will
to
henry
mind
be
proof
of
my
treason
but
mere
talk
such
as
gilbert
sends
is
no
proof
nowadays
we
barons
follow
the
church
and
like
anselm
we
speak
what
we
please
let
us
go
about
our
day
dealings
and
say
naught
to
gilbert
we
do
nothing
said
hugh
wait
said
de
aquila
i
am
old
but
still
i
find
that
the
most
grievous
work
i
know
so
we
found
it
but
in
the
end
de
aquila
was
right
little
later
in
the
year
armed
men
rode
over
the
hill
the
golden
horseshoes
flying
behind
the
king
banner
said
de
aquila
at
the
window
of
our
chamber
how
did
i
tell
you
here
comes
fulke
himself
to
spy
out
his
new
lands
which
our
king
hath
promised
him
if
he
can
bring
proof
of
my
treason
dost
thou
know
said
hugh
that
is
what
i
would
do
if
i
were
fulke
but
i
should
have
brought
more
men
my
roan
horse
to
your
old
shoes
said
he
fulke
brings
me
the
king
summons
to
leave
pevensey
and
join
the
war
he
sucked
in
his
cheeks
and
drummed
on
the
edge
of
the
where
the
water
sounded
all
hollow
we
go
said
i
at
this
time
of
year
stark
madness
said
he
take
me
from
pevensey
to
fisk
and
flyte
through
fern
and
forest
and
in
three
days
robert
keels
would
be
lying
on
pevensey
mud
with
ten
thousand
men
who
would
stop
them
fulke
horns
blew
without
and
anon
fulke
cried
the
king
summons
at
the
great
door
that
de
aquila
with
all
men
and
horse
should
join
the
king
camp
at
salisbury
did
i
tell
you
said
de
aquila
there
are
twenty
barons
here
and
salisbury
could
give
king
henry
good
land
service
but
he
has
been
worked
upon
by
fulke
to
send
south
and
call
me
me
the
gate
of
england
when
his
enemies
stand
about
to
batter
it
in
see
that
fulke
men
lie
in
the
big
south
barn
said
he
give
them
drink
and
when
fulke
has
eaten
we
will
drink
in
my
chamber
the
great
hall
is
too
cold
for
old
bones
soon
as
he
was
fulke
went
to
the
chapel
with
gilbert
to
give
thanks
for
his
safe
coming
and
when
he
had
eaten
he
was
a
fat
man
and
rolled
his
eyes
greedily
at
our
good
roast
sussex
we
led
him
to
the
little
upper
chamber
whither
gilbert
had
already
gone
with
the
i
remember
when
fulke
heard
the
tide
blow
and
whistle
in
the
shaft
he
leaped
back
and
his
long
caught
in
the
rushes
and
he
stumbled
so
that
jehan
behind
him
found
it
easy
to
knock
his
head
against
the
wall
you
know
it
was
going
to
happen
said
dan
said
sir
richard
with
a
sweet
smile
put
my
foot
on
his
sword
and
plucked
away
his
dagger
but
he
knew
not
whether
it
was
day
or
night
for
awhile
he
lay
rolling
his
eyes
and
bubbling
with
his
mouth
and
jehan
roped
him
like
a
calf
he
was
cased
all
in
that
newfangled
armour
which
we
call
not
rings
like
my
hauberk
here
sir
richard
tapped
his
chest
but
little
pieces
of
steel
overlapping
on
stout
leather
we
stripped
it
off
no
need
to
spoil
good
harness
by
wetting
it
and
in
the
de
aquila
found
the
same
folden
piece
of
parchment
which
we
had
put
back
under
the
this
gilbert
would
have
run
out
i
laid
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
it
sufficed
he
fell
to
trembling
and
praying
on
his
beads
said
de
aquila
here
be
more
notable
sayings
and
doings
of
our
lord
of
pevensey
for
thee
to
write
down
take
pen
and
gilbert
we
can
not
all
be
sacristans
of
battle
fulke
from
the
floor
ye
have
bound
a
king
messenger
pevensey
shall
burn
for
this
i
have
seen
it
besieged
once
said
de
aquila
but
heart
up
fulke
i
promise
thee
that
thou
shalt
be
hanged
in
the
middle
of
the
flames
at
the
end
of
that
siege
if
i
have
to
share
my
last
loaf
with
thee
and
that
is
more
than
odo
would
have
done
when
we
starved
out
him
and
mortain
fulke
sat
up
and
looked
long
and
cunningly
at
de
aquila
the
saints
said
he
why
didst
thou
not
say
thou
wast
on
the
duke
robert
side
at
the
first
i
said
de
aquila
laughed
and
said
no
man
who
serves
king
henry
dare
do
this
much
to
his
messenger
when
didst
thou
come
over
to
the
duke
let
me
up
and
we
can
smooth
it
out
together
and
he
smiled
and
becked
and
winked
we
will
smooth
it
out
said
de
aquila
he
nodded
to
me
and
jehan
and
i
heaved
up
fulke
he
was
a
heavy
man
and
lowered
him
into
the
shaft
by
a
rope
not
so
as
to
stand
on
our
gold
but
dangling
by
his
shoulders
a
little
above
it
was
turn
of
ebb
and
the
water
came
to
his
knees
he
said
nothing
but
shivered
somewhat
jehan
of
a
sudden
beat
down
gilbert
wrist
with
his
sheathed
dagger
stop
he
said
he
swallows
his
beads
belike
said
de
aquila
it
is
good
for
men
who
know
too
much
i
have
carried
it
these
thirty
years
give
me
gilbert
wept
and
howled
de
aquila
ran
the
beads
through
his
fingers
the
last
one
i
have
said
they
were
large
nuts
opened
in
two
halves
on
a
pin
and
there
was
a
small
folded
parchment
within
on
it
was
written
the
old
dog
goes
to
salisbury
to
be
beaten
i
have
his
kennel
come
quickly
is
worse
than
poison
said
de
aquila
very
softly
and
sucked
in
his
cheeks
then
gilbert
grovelled
in
the
rushes
and
told
us
all
he
knew
the
letter
as
we
guessed
was
from
fulke
to
the
duke
and
not
the
first
that
had
passed
between
them
fulke
had
given
it
to
gilbert
in
the
chapel
and
gilbert
thought
to
have
taken
it
by
morning
to
a
certain
fishing
boat
at
the
wharf
which
trafficked
between
pevensey
and
the
french
shore
gilbert
was
a
false
fellow
but
he
found
time
between
his
quakings
and
shakings
to
swear
that
the
master
of
the
boat
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
hath
called
me
said
gilbert
and
he
hath
thrown
at
me
but
for
all
that
he
is
no
traitor
will
have
no
clerk
of
mine
mishandled
or
miscalled
said
de
aquila
that
seaman
shall
be
whipped
at
his
own
mast
write
me
first
a
letter
and
thou
shalt
bear
it
with
the
order
for
the
whipping
tomorrow
to
the
boat
this
gilbert
would
have
kissed
de
aquila
hand
he
had
not
hoped
to
live
until
the
morning
and
when
he
trembled
less
he
wrote
a
letter
as
from
fulke
to
the
duke
saying
that
the
kennel
which
signified
pevensey
was
shut
and
that
the
old
dog
which
was
de
aquila
sat
outside
it
and
moreover
that
all
had
been
betrayed
to
any
man
that
all
is
betrayed
said
de
aquila
and
even
the
pope
himself
would
sleep
uneasily
eh
jehan
if
one
told
thee
all
was
betrayed
what
wouldst
thou
do
would
run
away
said
jehan
it
might
be
true
said
quoth
de
aquila
write
gilbert
that
montgomery
the
great
earl
hath
made
his
peace
with
the
king
and
that
little
whom
i
hate
hath
been
hanged
by
the
heels
we
will
give
robert
full
measure
to
chew
upon
write
also
that
fulke
himself
is
sick
to
death
of
a
dropsy
cried
fulke
hanging
in
the
drown
me
out
of
hand
but
do
not
make
a
jest
of
me
i
said
de
aquila
i
am
but
fighting
for
life
and
lands
with
a
pen
as
thou
hast
shown
me
fulke
fulke
groaned
for
he
was
cold
and
let
me
confess
said
he
this
is
right
neighbourly
said
de
aquila
leaning
over
the
shaft
thou
hast
read
my
sayings
and
doings
or
at
least
the
first
part
of
them
and
thou
art
minded
to
repay
me
with
thy
own
doings
and
sayings
take
pen
and
inkhorn
gilbert
here
is
work
that
will
not
irk
thee
my
men
go
without
hurt
and
i
will
confess
my
treason
against
the
king
said
fulke
why
has
he
grown
so
tender
of
his
men
of
a
sudden
said
hugh
to
me
for
fulke
had
no
name
for
mercy
to
his
men
plunder
he
gave
them
but
pity
none
te
said
de
aquila
thy
treason
was
all
confessed
long
ago
by
gilbert
it
would
be
enough
to
hang
montgomery
himself
but
spare
my
men
said
fulke
and
we
heard
him
splash
like
a
fish
in
a
pond
for
the
tide
was
rising
in
good
time
said
de
aquila
the
night
is
young
the
wine
is
old
and
we
need
only
the
merry
tale
begin
the
story
of
thy
life
since
when
thou
wast
a
lad
at
tours
tell
it
nimbly
shame
me
to
my
soul
said
fulke
i
have
done
what
neither
king
nor
duke
could
do
said
de
aquila
but
begin
and
forget
nothing
thy
man
away
said
fulke
much
can
i
do
said
de
aquila
remember
i
am
like
the
danes
king
i
can
not
turn
the
tide
long
will
it
rise
said
fulke
and
splashed
anew
three
hours
said
de
aquila
time
to
tell
all
thy
good
deeds
begin
and
gilbert
i
have
heard
thou
art
somewhat
careless
do
not
twist
his
words
from
his
true
meaning
fear
of
death
in
the
dark
being
upon
him
fulke
began
and
gilbert
not
knowing
what
his
fate
might
be
wrote
it
word
by
word
i
have
heard
many
tales
but
never
heard
i
aught
to
match
the
tale
of
fulke
his
black
life
as
fulke
told
it
hollowly
hanging
in
the
shaft
it
bad
said
dan
awestruck
belief
sir
richard
answered
the
less
there
was
that
in
it
which
forced
even
gilbert
to
laugh
we
three
laughed
till
we
ached
at
one
place
his
teeth
so
chattered
that
we
could
not
well
hear
and
we
reached
him
down
a
cup
of
wine
then
he
warmed
to
it
and
smoothly
set
out
all
his
shifts
malices
and
treacheries
his
extreme
boldnesses
he
was
desperate
bold
his
retreats
shufflings
and
counterfeitings
he
was
also
inconceivably
a
coward
his
lack
of
gear
and
honour
his
despair
at
their
loss
his
remedies
and
contrivances
yes
he
waved
the
filthy
rags
of
his
life
before
us
as
though
they
had
been
some
proud
banner
when
he
ceased
we
saw
by
torches
that
the
tide
stood
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
he
breathed
strongly
through
his
nose
had
him
out
and
rubbed
him
we
wrapped
him
in
a
cloak
and
gave
him
wine
and
we
leaned
and
looked
upon
him
the
while
he
drank
he
was
shivering
but
shameless
a
sudden
we
heard
jehan
at
the
stairway
wake
but
a
boy
pushed
past
him
and
stood
before
us
the
in
his
hair
all
slubbered
with
sleep
my
father
my
father
i
dreamed
of
treachery
he
cried
and
babbled
thickly
is
no
treachery
here
said
fulke
go
and
the
boy
turned
even
then
not
fully
awake
and
jehan
led
him
by
the
hand
to
the
great
hall
only
son
said
de
aquila
why
didst
thou
bring
the
child
here
is
my
heir
i
dared
not
trust
him
to
my
brother
said
fulke
and
now
he
was
ashamed
de
aquila
said
nothing
but
sat
weighing
a
in
his
two
hands
thus
anon
fulke
touched
him
on
the
knee
the
boy
escape
to
normandy
said
he
and
do
with
me
at
thy
pleasure
yea
hang
me
tomorrow
with
my
letter
to
robert
round
my
neck
but
let
the
boy
go
still
said
de
aquila
i
think
for
england
we
waited
what
our
lord
of
pevensey
should
devise
and
the
sweat
ran
down
fulke
forehead
last
said
de
aquila
i
am
too
old
to
judge
or
to
trust
any
man
i
do
not
covet
thy
lands
as
thou
hast
coveted
mine
and
whether
thou
art
any
better
or
any
worse
than
any
other
black
angevin
thief
it
is
for
thy
king
to
find
out
therefore
go
back
to
thy
king
fulke
thou
wilt
say
nothing
of
what
has
passed
said
fulke
should
i
thy
son
will
stay
with
me
if
the
king
calls
me
again
to
leave
pevensey
which
i
must
guard
against
england
enemies
if
the
king
sends
his
men
against
me
for
a
traitor
or
if
i
hear
that
the
king
in
his
bed
thinks
any
evil
of
me
or
my
two
knights
thy
son
will
be
hanged
from
out
this
window
fulke
it
had
anything
to
do
with
his
son
cried
una
startled
could
we
have
hanged
fulke
said
sir
richard
needed
him
to
make
our
peace
with
the
king
he
would
have
betrayed
half
england
for
the
boy
sake
of
that
we
were
sure
do
understand
said
una
i
think
it
was
simply
awful
did
not
fulke
he
was
well
pleased
because
his
son
was
going
to
be
killed
because
de
aquila
had
shown
him
how
he
might
save
the
boy
life
and
his
own
lands
and
honours
i
will
do
it
he
said
i
swear
i
will
do
it
i
will
tell
the
king
thou
art
no
traitor
but
the
most
excellent
valiant
and
perfect
of
us
all
yes
i
will
save
thee
aquila
looked
still
into
the
bottom
of
the
cup
rolling
the
to
and
fro
he
said
if
i
had
a
son
i
would
i
think
save
him
but
do
not
by
any
means
tell
me
how
thou
wilt
go
about
it
nay
said
fulke
nodding
his
bald
head
wisely
that
is
my
secret
but
rest
at
ease
de
aquila
no
hair
of
thy
head
nor
rood
of
thy
land
shall
be
forfeited
and
he
smiled
like
one
planning
great
good
deeds
henceforward
said
de
aquila
i
counsel
thee
to
serve
one
master
not
two
said
fulke
can
i
work
no
more
honest
trading
between
the
two
sides
these
troublous
times
robert
or
the
king
england
or
normandy
said
de
aquila
i
care
not
which
it
is
but
make
thy
choice
here
and
now
king
then
said
fulke
for
i
see
he
is
better
served
than
robert
shall
i
swear
it
need
said
de
aquila
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
parchments
which
gilbert
had
written
it
shall
be
some
part
of
my
penance
to
copy
out
the
savoury
tale
of
thy
life
till
we
have
made
ten
twenty
an
hundred
maybe
copies
how
many
cattle
think
you
would
the
bishop
of
tours
give
for
that
tale
or
thy
brother
or
the
monks
of
blois
minstrels
will
turn
it
into
songs
which
thy
own
saxon
serfs
shall
sing
behind
their
and
riding
through
thy
norman
towns
from
here
to
rome
fulke
men
will
make
very
merry
over
that
tale
and
how
fulke
told
it
hanging
in
a
well
like
a
drowned
puppy
this
shall
be
thy
punishment
if
ever
i
find
thee
with
thy
king
any
more
meantime
the
parchments
stay
here
with
thy
son
him
i
will
return
to
thee
when
thou
hast
made
my
peace
with
the
king
the
parchments
never
hid
his
face
and
groaned
of
the
saints
said
de
aquila
laughing
the
pen
cuts
deep
i
could
never
have
fetched
that
grunt
out
of
thee
with
any
sword
so
long
as
i
do
not
anger
thee
my
tale
will
be
secret
said
fulke
so
long
does
that
comfort
thee
fulke
said
de
aquila
other
comfort
have
ye
left
me
he
said
and
of
a
sudden
he
wept
hopelessly
like
a
child
dropping
his
face
on
his
knees
fulke
said
una
pitied
him
also
said
sir
richard
the
spur
corn
said
de
aquila
and
he
threw
fulke
three
wedges
of
gold
that
he
had
taken
from
our
little
chest
by
the
bedplace
i
had
known
this
said
fulke
catching
his
breath
i
would
never
have
lifted
hand
against
pevensey
only
lack
of
this
yellow
stuff
has
made
me
so
unlucky
in
my
dealings
was
dawn
then
and
they
stirred
in
the
great
hall
below
we
sent
down
fulke
mail
to
be
scoured
and
when
he
rode
away
at
noon
under
his
own
and
the
king
banner
very
splendid
and
stately
did
he
show
he
smoothed
his
long
beard
and
called
his
son
to
his
stirrup
and
kissed
him
de
aquila
rode
with
him
as
far
as
the
new
mill
landward
we
thought
the
night
had
been
all
a
dream
did
he
make
it
right
with
the
king
dan
asked
your
not
being
traitors
i
mean
sir
richard
smiled
king
sent
no
second
summons
to
pevensey
nor
did
he
ask
why
de
aquila
had
not
obeyed
the
first
yes
that
was
fulke
work
i
know
not
how
he
did
it
but
it
was
well
and
swiftly
done
you
did
do
anything
to
his
son
said
una
boy
oh
he
was
an
imp
he
turned
the
keep
doors
out
of
dortoirs
while
we
had
him
he
sang
foul
songs
learned
in
the
camps
poor
fool
he
set
the
hounds
fighting
in
hall
he
lit
the
rushes
to
drive
out
as
he
said
the
fleas
he
drew
his
dagger
on
jehan
who
threw
him
down
the
stairway
for
it
and
he
rode
his
horse
through
crops
and
among
sheep
but
when
we
had
beaten
him
and
showed
him
wolf
and
deer
he
followed
us
old
men
like
a
young
eager
hound
and
called
us
uncle
his
father
came
the
summer
end
to
take
him
away
but
the
boy
had
no
lust
to
go
because
of
the
and
he
stayed
on
till
the
i
gave
him
a
bittern
claw
to
bring
him
good
luck
at
shooting
an
imp
if
ever
there
was
what
happened
to
gilbert
said
dan
even
a
whipping
de
aquila
said
he
would
sooner
a
clerk
however
false
that
knew
the
than
a
fool
however
true
that
must
be
taught
his
work
afresh
moreover
after
that
night
i
think
gilbert
loved
as
much
as
he
feared
de
aquila
at
least
he
would
not
leave
us
not
even
when
vivian
the
king
clerk
would
have
made
him
sacristan
of
battle
abbey
a
false
fellow
but
in
his
fashion
bold
robert
ever
land
in
pevensey
after
all
dan
went
on
guarded
the
coast
too
well
while
henry
was
fighting
his
barons
and
three
or
four
years
later
when
england
had
peace
henry
crossed
to
normandy
and
showed
his
brother
some
work
at
tenchebrai
that
cured
robert
of
fighting
many
of
henry
men
sailed
from
pevensey
to
that
war
fulke
came
i
remember
and
we
all
four
lay
in
the
little
chamber
once
again
and
drank
together
de
aquila
was
right
one
should
not
judge
men
fulke
was
merry
yes
always
merry
with
a
catch
in
his
breath
what
did
you
do
afterwards
said
una
talked
together
of
times
past
that
is
all
men
can
do
when
they
grow
old
little
maid
the
bell
for
tea
rang
faintly
across
the
meadows
dan
lay
in
the
bows
of
the
golden
hind
una
in
the
stern
the
book
of
verses
open
in
her
lap
was
reading
from
slave
dream
in
the
mist
and
shadow
of
sleep
he
saw
his
native
land
do
know
when
you
began
that
said
dan
sleepily
on
the
middle
thwart
of
the
boat
beside
una
lay
an
oak
leaf
an
ash
leaf
and
a
thorn
leaf
that
must
have
dropped
down
from
the
trees
above
and
the
brook
giggled
as
though
it
had
just
seen
some
joke
the
runes

me
to

almost
as
long
as

had
come
to
grief
over
his
latin
and
was
kept
in
so
una
went
alone
to
far
wood
dan
big
catapult
and
the
lead
bullets
that
hobden
had
made
for
him
were
hidden
in
an
old
hollow
on
the
west
of
the
wood
they
had
named
the
place
out
of
the
verse
in
lays
of
ancient
rome
from
lordly
volaterrae
where
scowls
the
hold
piled
by
the
hands
of
giants
for
godlike
kings
of
old
they
were
the
kings
and
when
old
hobden
piled
some
comfortable
brushwood
between
the
big
wooden
knees
of
volaterrae
they
called
him
of
giants
una
slipped
through
their
private
gap
in
the
fence
and
sat
still
awhile
scowling
as
scowlily
and
lordlily
as
she
knew
how
for
volaterrae
is
an
important
that
juts
out
of
far
wood
just
as
far
wood
juts
out
of
the
hillside
pook

lay
below
her
and
all
the
turns
of
the
brook
as
it
wanders
out
of
the
willingford
woods
between
to
old
hobden
cottage
at
the
forge
the
wind
there
is
always
a
wind
by
volaterrae
blew
from
the
bare
ridge
where
cherry
clack
windmill
stands
now
wind
prowling
through
woods
sounds
like
exciting
things
going
to
happen
and
that
is
why
on
blowy
days
you
stand
up
in
volaterrae
and
shout
bits
of
the
lays
to
suit
its
noises
una
took
dan
catapult
from
its
secret
place
and
made
ready
to
meet
lars
porsena
army
stealing
through
the
aspens
by
the
brook
a
gust
boomed
up
the
valley
and
una
chanted
sorrowfully
down
to
ostia

stormed

and
the

slain
but
the
wind
not
charging
fair
to
the
wood
started
aside
and
shook
a
single
oak
in
gleason
pasture
here
it
made
itself
all
small
and
crouched
among
the
grasses
waving
the
tips
of
them
as
a
cat
waves
the
tip
of
her
tail
before
she
springs
welcome
welcome

una
loading
the
catapult
welcome
to
thy
home
why
dost
thou
stay
and
turn
away
here
lies
the
road
to
rome
she
fired
into
the
face
of
the
lull
to
wake
up
the
cowardly
wind
and
heard
a
grunt
from
behind
a
thorn
in
the
pasture
my
winkie
she
said
aloud
and
that
was
something
she
had
picked
up
from
dan
i
tickled
up
a
gleason
cow
little
painted
beast
a
voice
cried
teach
you
to
sling
your
masters
she
looked
down
most
cautiously
and
saw
a
young
man
covered
with
hoopy
bronze
armour
all
glowing
among
the
late
broom
but
what
una
admired
beyond
all
was
his
great
bronze
helmet
with
a
red
that
flicked
in
the
wind
she
could
hear
the
long
hairs
rasp
on
his
shimmery
does
the
faun
mean
he
said
half
aloud
to
himself
telling
me
that
the
painted
people
have
changed
he
caught
sight
of
yellow
head
you
seen
a
painted
he
called
said
una
if
you
seen
a
bullet
cried
the
man
passed
within
a
hair
breadth
of
my
ear
that
was
me
i
most
awfully
sorry
the
faun
tell
you
i
was
coming
he
smiled
if
you
mean
puck
i
thought
you
were
a
gleason
cow
i
i
know
you
were
a
a
what
are
you
he
laughed
outright
showing
a
set
of
splendid
teeth
his
face
and
eyes
were
dark
and
his
eyebrows
met
above
his
big
nose
in
one
bushy
black
bar
call
me
parnesius
i
have
been
a
centurion
of
the
seventh
cohort
of
the
thirtieth
legion
the
ulpia
victrix
did
you
sling
that
bullet
did
i
was
using
dan
catapult
said
una
said
he
ought
to
know
something
about
them
show
me
he
leaped
the
rough
fence
with
a
rattle
of
spear
shield
and
armour
and
hoisted
himself
into
volaterrae
as
quickly
as
a
shadow
sling
on
a
forked
stick
i
understand
he
cried
and
pulled
at
the
elastic
what
wonderful
beast
yields
this
stretching
leather
laccy
elastic
you
put
the
bullet
into
that
loop
and
then
you
pull
hard
the
man
pulled
and
hit
himself
square
on
his
thumbnail
to
his
own
weapon
he
said
gravely
handing
it
back
am
better
with
the
bigger
machine
little
maiden
but
it
a
pretty
toy
a
wolf
would
laugh
at
it
are
you
afraid
of
wolves
are
any
said
una
believe
it
a
wolf
like
a
winged
hat
he
comes
when
he
expected
do
they
hunt
wolves
here
do
hunt
una
remembering
what
she
had
heard
from
preserve
pheasants
do
you
know
them
ought
to
said
the
young
man
smiling
again
and
he
imitated
the
cry
of
the
so
perfectly
that
a
bird
answered
out
of
the
wood
a
big
painted
clucking
fool
is
a
pheasant
he
said
like
some
romans
you
a
roman
yourself
are
you
said
una
and
no
i
one
of
a
good
few
thousands
who
have
never
seen
rome
except
in
a
picture
my
people
have
lived
at
vectis
for
generations
vectis
that
island
west
yonder
that
you
can
see
from
so
far
in
clear
weather
you
mean
the
isle
of
wight
it
lifts
up
just
before
rain
and
you
see
it
from
the
downs
likely
our
villa
on
the
south
edge
of
the
island
by
the
broken
cliffs
most
of
it
is
three
hundred
years
old
but
the
where
our
first
ancestor
lived
must
be
a
hundred
years
older
oh
quite
that
because
the
founder
of
our
family
had
his
land
given
him
by
agricola
at
the
settlement
it
not
a
bad
little
place
for
its
size
in
springtime
violets
grow
down
to
the
very
beach
gathered
for
myself
and
violets
for
my
mother
many
a
time
with
our
old
nurse
your
nurse
a
a
romaness
too
a
numidian
gods
be
good
to
her
a
dear
fat
brown
thing
with
a
tongue
like
a
cowbell
she
was
a
free
woman
by
the
way
are
you
free
maiden
quite
said
una
least
till
and
in
summer
our
governess
does
say
much
if
we
late
the
young
man
laughed
again
a
proper
understanding
laugh
see
said
he
accounts
for
your
being
in
the
wood
we
hid
among
the
cliffs
you
have
a
governess
then
we
not
a
greek
too
she
had
a
way
of
clutching
her
dress
when
she
hunted
us
among
the
that
made
us
laugh
then
say
she
get
us
whipped
she
never
did
though
bless
her
aglaia
was
a
thorough
sportswoman
for
all
her
learning
what
lessons
did
you
do
when
when
you
were
little
history
the
classics
arithmetic
and
so
on
answered
sister
and
i
were
thickheads
but
my
two
brothers
i
the
middle
one
liked
those
things
and
of
course
mother
was
clever
enough
for
any
six
she
was
nearly
as
tall
as
i
am
and
she
looked
like
the
new
statue
on
the
western
road
the
demeter
of
the
baskets
you
know
and
funny
roma
dea
how
mother
could
make
us
laugh
at
jokes
and
sayings
that
every
family
has
do
you
know
know
we
have
but
i
did
know
other
people
had
them
too
said
una
me
about
all
your
family
please
families
are
very
much
alike
mother
would
sit
spinning
of
evenings
while
aglaia
read
in
her
corner
and
father
did
accounts
and
we
four
romped
about
the
passages
when
our
noise
grew
too
loud
the
pater
would
say
less
tumult
less
tumult
have
you
never
heard
of
a
father
right
over
his
children
he
can
slay
them
my
loves
slay
them
dead
and
the
gods
highly
approve
of
the
action
then
mother
would
prim
up
her
dear
mouth
over
the
wheel
and
answer
h
afraid
there
ca
be
much
of
the
roman
father
about
you
then
the
pater
would
roll
up
his
accounts
and
say
i
show
you
and
then
then
he
be
worse
than
any
of
us
can
if
they
like
said
una
her
eyes
dancing
i
say
all
good
families
are
very
much
the
same
did
you
do
in
summer
said
una
about
like
us
and
we
visited
our
friends
there
are
no
wolves
in
vectis
we
had
many
friends
and
as
many
ponies
as
we
wished
must
have
been
lovely
said
una
hope
it
lasted
for
ever
quite
little
maid
when
i
was
about
sixteen
or
seventeen
the
father
felt
gouty
and
we
all
went
to
the
waters
waters
aquae
sulis
every
one
goes
there
you
ought
to
get
your
father
to
take
you
some
day
where
i
do
know
said
una
the
young
man
looked
astonished
for
a
moment
sulis
he
repeated
best
baths
in
britain
just
as
good
i
told
as
rome
all
the
old
gluttons
sit
in
hot
water
and
talk
scandal
and
politics
and
the
generals
come
through
the
streets
with
their
guards
behind
them
and
the
magistrates
come
in
their
chairs
with
their
stiff
guards
behind
them
and
you
meet
and
goldsmiths
and
merchants
and
philosophers
and
and
britons
and
romans
and
tame
tribesmen
pretending
to
be
civilised
and
jew
lecturers
and
oh
everybody
interesting
we
young
people
of
course
took
no
interest
in
politics
we
had
not
the
gout
there
were
many
of
our
age
like
us
we
did
not
find
life
sad
while
we
were
enjoying
ourselves
without
thinking
my
sister
met
the
son
of
a
magistrate
in
the
west
and
a
year
afterwards
she
was
married
to
him
my
young
brother
who
was
always
interested
in
plants
and
roots
met
the
first
doctor
of
a
legion
from
the
city
of
the
legions
and
he
decided
that
he
would
be
an
army
doctor
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
profession
for
a
man
but
then
i
not
my
brother
he
went
to
rome
to
study
medicine
and
now
he
first
doctor
of
a
legion
in
egypt
at
antinoe
i
think
but
i
have
not
heard
from
him
for
some
time
eldest
brother
came
across
a
greek
philosopher
and
told
my
father
that
he
intended
to
settle
down
on
the
estate
as
a
farmer
and
a
philosopher
you
see
the
young
man
eyes
twinkled
philosopher
was
a
one
thought
philosophers
were
bald
said
una
all
she
was
very
pretty
i
do
blame
him
nothing
could
have
suited
me
better
than
my
eldest
brother
doing
this
for
i
was
only
too
keen
to
join
the
army
i
had
always
feared
i
should
have
to
stay
at
home
and
look
after
the
estate
while
my
brother
took
this
he
rapped
on
his
great
glistening
shield
that
never
seemed
to
be
in
his
way
we
were
well
contented
we
young
people
and
we
rode
back
to
clausentum
along
the
wood
road
very
quietly
but
when
we
reached
home
aglaia
our
governess
saw
what
had
come
to
us
i
remember
her
at
the
door
the
torch
over
her
head
watching
us
climb
the
from
the
boat
aie
aie
she
said
children
you
went
away
men
and
a
woman
you
return
then
she
kissed
mother
and
mother
wept
thus
our
visit
to
the
waters
settled
our
fates
for
each
of
us
maiden
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
listened
leaning
on
the
think
that
dan
my
brother
said
una
and
the
faun
is
with
him
replied
as
dan
with
puck
stumbled
through
the
copse
should
have
come
sooner
puck
called
the
beauties
of
your
native
tongue
o
parnesius
have
enthralled
this
young
citizen
parnesius
looked
bewildered
even
when
una
explained
said
the
plural
of
dominus
was
dominoes
and
when
miss
blake
said
it
was
he
said
he
supposed
it
was
backgammon
and
so
he
had
to
write
it
out
twice
for
cheek
you
know
dan
had
climbed
into
volaterrae
hot
and
panting
run
nearly
all
the
way
gasped
then
puck
met
me
how
do
you
do
sir
am
in
good
health
parnesius
answered
i
have
tried
to
bend
the
bow
of
ulysses
but
he
held
up
his
thumb
sorry
you
must
have
pulled
off
too
soon
said
dan
puck
said
you
were
telling
una
a
story
o
parnesius
said
puck
who
had
perched
himself
on
a
dead
branch
above
them
will
be
chorus
has
he
puzzled
you
much
una
a
bit
except
i
did
know
where
ak
ak
something
was
she
answered
aquae
sulis
that
bath
where
the
buns
come
from
let
the
hero
tell
his
own
tale
parnesius
pretended
to
thrust
his
spear
at
puck
legs
but
puck
reached
down
caught
at
the
plume
and
pulled
off
the
tall
helmet
jester
said
parnesius
shaking
his
curly
dark
head
is
cooler
now
hang
it
up
for
me
was
telling
your
sister
how
i
joined
the
army
he
said
to
dan
you
have
to
pass
an
exam
dan
asked
eagerly
i
went
to
my
father
and
said
i
should
like
to
enter
the
dacian
horse
i
had
seen
some
at
aquae
sulis
but
he
said
i
had
better
begin
service
in
a
regular
legion
from
rome
now
like
many
of
our
youngsters
i
was
not
too
fond
of
anything
roman
the
officers
and
magistrates
looked
down
on
us
as
though
we
were
barbarians
i
told
my
father
so
know
they
do
he
said
but
remember
after
all
we
are
the
people
of
the
old
stock
and
our
duty
is
to
the
empire
which
empire
i
asked
we
split
the
eagle
before
i
was
born
thieves
talk
is
that
said
my
father
he
hated
slang
sir
i
said
we
one
emperor
in
rome
and
i
do
know
how
many
emperors
the
outlying
provinces
have
set
up
from
time
to
time
which
am
i
to
follow
said
he
at
least
he
a
sportsman
all
that
i
said
has
he
turned
himself
into
a
scythian
did
you
hear
of
it
said
the
pater
aquae
sulis
i
said
it
was
perfectly
true
this
precious
emperor
gratian
of
ours
had
a
bodyguard
of
scythians
and
he
was
so
crazy
about
them
that
he
dressed
like
them
in
rome
of
all
places
in
the
world
it
was
as
bad
as
if
my
own
father
had
painted
himself
blue
matter
for
the
clothes
said
the
pater
they
are
only
the
fringe
of
the
trouble
it
began
before
your
time
or
mine
rome
has
forsaken
her
gods
and
must
be
punished
the
great
war
with
the
painted
people
broke
out
in
the
very
year
the
temples
of
our
gods
were
destroyed
we
beat
the
painted
people
in
the
very
year
our
temples
were
rebuilt
go
back
further
still
he
went
back
to
the
time
of
diocletian
and
to
listen
to
him
you
would
have
thought
eternal
rome
herself
was
on
the
edge
of
destruction
just
because
a
few
people
had
become
a
little
knew
nothing
about
it
aglaia
never
taught
us
the
history
of
our
own
country
she
was
so
full
of
her
ancient
greeks
is
no
hope
for
rome
said
the
pater
at
last
she
has
forsaken
her
gods
but
if
the
gods
forgive
us
here
we
may
save
britain
to
do
that
we
must
keep
the
painted
people
back
therefore
i
tell
you
parnesius
as
a
father
that
if
your
heart
is
set
on
service
your
place
is
among
men
on
the
wall
and
not
with
women
among
the
cities
wall
asked
dan
and
una
at
once
meant
the
one
we
call
hadrian
wall
i
tell
you
about
it
later
it
was
built
long
ago
across
north
britain
to
keep
out
the
painted
people
picts
you
call
them
father
had
fought
in
the
great
pict
war
that
lasted
more
than
twenty
years
and
he
knew
what
fighting
meant
theodosius
one
of
our
great
generals
had
chased
the
little
beasts
back
far
into
the
north
before
i
was
born
down
at
vectis
of
course
we
never
troubled
our
heads
about
them
but
when
my
father
spoke
as
he
did
i
kissed
his
hand
and
waited
for
orders
we
romans
know
what
is
due
to
our
parents
i
kissed
my
father
hand
he
laugh
said
dan
change
but
if
you
do
not
obey
your
father
the
gods
remember
it
you
may
be
quite
sure
of
that
our
talk
seeing
i
was
in
earnest
the
pater
sent
me
over
to
clausentum
to
learn
my
in
a
barrack
full
of
foreign
auxiliaries
as
unwashed
and
unshaved
a
mob
of
mixed
barbarians
as
ever
scrubbed
a
breastplate
it
was
your
stick
in
their
stomachs
and
your
shield
in
their
faces
to
push
them
into
any
sort
of
formation
when
i
had
learned
my
work
the
instructor
gave
me
a
handful
and
they
were
a
handful
gauls
and
iberians
to
polish
up
till
they
were
sent
to
their
stations
i
did
my
best
and
one
night
a
villa
in
the
suburbs
caught
fire
and
i
had
my
handful
out
and
at
work
before
any
of
the
other
troops
i
noticed
a
man
on
the
lawn
leaning
on
a
stick
he
watched
us
passing
buckets
from
the
pond
and
at
last
he
said
to
me
who
are
you
probationer
waiting
for
a
command
i
answered
i
did
know
who
he
was
from
deucalion
in
britain
he
said
if
you
were
born
in
spain
i
said
for
he
neighed
his
words
like
an
iberian
mule
what
might
you
call
yourself
when
you
are
at
home
he
said
laughing
depends
i
answered
sometimes
one
thing
and
sometimes
another
but
now
i
busy
said
no
more
till
we
had
saved
the
family
gods
they
were
respectable
householders
and
then
he
grunted
across
the
laurels
listen
young
in
future
call
yourself
centurion
of
the
seventh
cohort
of
the
thirtieth
the
ulpia
victrix
that
will
help
me
to
remember
you
your
father
and
a
few
other
people
call
me
maximus
tossed
me
the
polished
stick
he
was
leaning
on
and
went
away
you
might
have
knocked
me
down
with
it
was
he
said
dan
himself
our
great
general
the
general
of
britain
who
had
been
theodosius
right
hand
in
the
pict
war
not
only
had
he
given
me
my
centurion
stick
direct
but
three
steps
in
a
good
legion
as
well
a
new
man
generally
begins
in
the
tenth
cohort
of
his
legion
and
works
up
were
you
pleased
said
una
i
thought
maximus
had
chosen
me
for
my
good
looks
and
fine
style
in
marching
but
when
i
went
home
the
pater
told
me
he
had
served
under
maximus
in
the
great
pict
war
and
had
asked
him
to
befriend
me
child
you
were
said
puck
from
above
was
said
parnesius
begrudge
it
me
faun
afterwards
the
gods
know
i
put
aside
the
games
and
puck
nodded
brown
chin
on
brown
hand
his
big
eyes
still
night
before
i
left
we
sacrificed
to
our
ancestors
the
usual
little
home
sacrifice
but
i
never
prayed
so
earnestly
to
all
the
good
shades
and
then
i
went
with
my
father
by
boat
to
regnum
and
across
the
chalk
eastwards
to
anderida
yonder
anderida
the
children
turned
their
faces
to
puck
chichester
he
said
pointing
towards
cherry
clack
he
threw
his
arm
south
behind
him
pevensey
again
said
dan
weland
landed
and
a
few
others
said
puck
is
young
even
compared
to
me
headquarters
of
the
thirtieth
lay
at
anderida
in
summer
but
my
own
cohort
the
seventh
was
on
the
wall
up
north
maximus
was
inspecting
auxiliaries
the
abulci
i
think
at
anderida
and
we
stayed
with
him
for
he
and
my
father
were
very
old
friends
i
was
only
there
ten
days
when
i
was
ordered
to
go
up
with
thirty
men
to
my
cohort
he
laughed
merrily
man
never
forgets
his
first
march
i
was
happier
than
any
emperor
when
i
led
my
handful
through
the
north
gate
of
the
camp
and
we
saluted
the
guard
and
the
altar
of
victory
there
how
said
dan
and
una
parnesius
smiled
and
stood
up
flashing
in
his
armour
said
he
and
he
moved
slowly
through
the
beautiful
movements
of
the
roman
salute
that
ends
with
a
hollow
clang
of
the
shield
coming
into
its
place
between
the
shoulders
said
puck
sets
one
thinking
went
out
fully
armed
said
parnesius
sitting
down
as
soon
as
the
road
entered
the
great
forest
my
men
expected
the
to
hang
their
shields
on
no
i
said
you
can
dress
like
women
in
anderida
but
while
you
with
me
you
will
carry
your
own
weapons
and
armour
it
hot
said
one
of
them
and
we
have
a
doctor
suppose
we
get
sunstroke
or
a
fever
die
i
said
and
a
good
riddance
to
rome
up
shield
up
spears
and
tighten
your
think
yourself
emperor
of
britain
already
a
fellow
shouted
i
knocked
him
over
with
the
butt
of
my
spear
and
explained
to
these
romans
that
if
there
were
any
further
trouble
we
should
go
on
with
one
man
short
and
by
the
light
of
the
sun
i
meant
it
too
my
raw
gauls
at
clausentum
had
never
treated
me
so
quietly
as
a
cloud
maximus
rode
out
of
the
fern
my
father
behind
him
and
reined
up
across
the
road
he
wore
the
purple
as
though
he
were
already
emperor
his
leggings
were
of
white
buckskin
laced
with
gold
men
dropped
like
like
partridges
said
nothing
for
some
time
only
looked
with
his
eyes
puckered
then
he
crooked
his
forefinger
and
my
men
walked
crawled
i
mean
to
one
side
in
the
sun
children
he
said
and
they
formed
up
on
the
hard
road
would
you
have
done
he
said
to
me
if
i
had
not
been
here
should
have
killed
that
man
i
answered
him
now
he
said
he
will
not
move
a
limb
i
said
you
taken
my
men
out
of
my
command
i
should
only
be
your
butcher
if
i
killed
him
now
do
you
see
what
i
meant
parnesius
turned
to
dan
dan
would
have
been
fair
somehow
was
what
i
thought
said
parnesius
maximus
frowned
you
never
be
an
emperor
he
said
not
even
a
general
will
you
be
was
silent
but
my
father
seemed
pleased
came
here
to
see
the
last
of
you
he
said
have
seen
it
said
maximus
i
shall
never
need
your
son
any
more
he
will
live
and
he
will
die
an
officer
of
a
legion
and
he
might
have
been
prefect
of
one
of
my
provinces
now
eat
and
drink
with
us
he
said
your
men
will
wait
till
you
have
finished
miserable
thirty
stood
like
glistening
in
the
hot
sun
and
maximus
led
us
to
where
his
people
had
set
a
meal
himself
he
mixed
the
wine
year
from
now
he
said
you
will
remember
that
you
have
sat
with
the
emperor
of
britain
and
gaul
said
the
pater
you
can
drive
two
mules
gaul
and
britain
years
hence
you
will
remember
that
you
have
drunk
he
passed
me
the
cup
and
there
was
blue
borage
in
it
with
the
emperor
of
rome
you
ca
drive
three
mules
they
will
tear
you
in
pieces
said
my
father
you
on
the
wall
among
the
heather
will
weep
because
your
notion
of
justice
was
more
to
you
than
the
favour
of
the
emperor
of
rome
sat
quite
still
one
does
not
answer
a
general
who
wears
the
purple
am
not
angry
with
you
he
went
on
i
owe
too
much
to
your
father
owe
me
nothing
but
advice
that
you
never
took
said
the
to
be
unjust
to
any
of
your
family
indeed
i
say
you
may
make
a
good
tribune
but
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
on
the
wall
you
will
live
and
on
the
wall
you
will
die
said
maximus
like
said
my
father
but
we
shall
have
the
picts
and
their
friends
breaking
through
before
long
you
can
not
move
all
troops
out
of
britain
to
make
you
emperor
and
expect
the
north
to
sit
quiet
follow
my
destiny
said
maximus
it
then
said
my
father
pulling
up
a
fern
root
and
die
as
theodosius
died
said
maximus
my
old
general
was
killed
because
he
served
the
empire
too
well
i
may
be
killed
but
not
for
that
reason
and
he
smiled
a
little
pale
grey
smile
that
made
my
blood
run
cold
i
had
better
follow
my
destiny
i
said
and
take
my
men
to
the
wall
looked
at
me
a
long
time
and
bowed
his
head
slanting
like
a
spaniard
follow
it
boy
he
said
that
was
all
i
was
only
too
glad
to
get
away
though
i
had
many
messages
for
home
i
found
my
men
standing
as
they
had
been
put
they
had
not
even
shifted
their
feet
in
the
dust
and
off
i
marched
still
feeling
that
terrific
smile
like
an
east
wind
up
my
back
i
never
halted
them
till
sunset
and
he
turned
about
and
looked
at
pook
hill
below
him
i
halted
yonder
he
pointed
to
the
broken
shoulder
of
the
forge
hill
behind
old
hobden
cottage
why
that
only
the
old
forge
where
they
made
iron
once
said
dan
good
stuff
it
was
too
said
parnesius
calmly
mended
three
here
and
had
a
riveted
the
forge
was
rented
from
the
government
by
a
smith
from
carthage
i
remember
we
called
him
cyclops
he
sold
me
a
rug
for
my
sister
room
it
could
have
been
here
dan
insisted
it
was
from
the
altar
of
victory
at
anderida
to
the
first
forge
in
the
forest
here
is
twelve
miles
seven
hundred
paces
it
is
all
in
the
road
book
a
man
does
forget
his
first
march
i
think
i
could
tell
you
every
station
between
this
and
he
leaned
forward
but
his
eye
was
caught
by
the
setting
sun
it
had
come
down
to
the
top
of
cherry
clack
hill
and
the
light
poured
in
between
the
tree
trunks
so
that
you
could
see
red
and
gold
and
black
deep
into
the
heart
of
far
wood
and
parnesius
in
his
armour
shone
as
though
he
had
been
afire
he
said
lifting
a
hand
and
the
sunlight
jinked
on
his
glass
bracelet
i
pray
to
mithras
he
rose
and
stretched
his
arms
westward
with
deep
words
then
puck
began
to
sing
too
in
a
voice
like
bells
tolling
and
as
he
sang
he
slipped
from
volaterrae
to
the
ground
and
beckoned
the
children
to
follow
they
obeyed
it
seemed
as
though
the
voices
were
pushing
them
along
and
through
the
light
on
the
beech
leaves
they
walked
while
puck
between
them
chanted
something
like
this
mundus
militat
sub
vana
gloria
cujus
prosperitas
est
transitoria
tam
cito
labitur
ejus
potentia
quam
vasa

found
themselves
at
the
little
locked
gates
of
the
wood
caesar
abiit

dives
splendidus

in
prandio

still
singing
he
took
dan
hand
and
wheeled
him
round
to
face
una
as
she
came
out
of
the
gate
it
shut
behind
her
at
the
same
time
as
puck
threw
the
oak
ash
and
thorn
leaves
over
their
heads
you
are
jolly
late
said
una
you
get
away
before
did
said
dan
got
away
in
lots
of
time
but
but
i
did
know
it
was
so
late
where
you
been
volaterrae
waiting
for
you
said
dan
was
all
that
beastly
latin
a
song
my
father
father
saw
it
not
and
i
belike
shall
never
come
to
look
on
that
spot
the
very
rome
crowned
by
all
time
all
art
all
might
the
equal
work
of
gods
and
man
city
beneath
whose
oldest
height
the
race
began
soon
to
send
forth
again
a
brood
unshakeable
we
pray
that
clings
to
rome
hardihood
in
arduous
things
strong
heart
with
triple
armour
bound
beat
strongly
for
thy
runs
age
after
age
the
empire
round
in
us
thy
sons
who
distant
from
the
seven
hills
loving
and
serving
much
require
thee
thee
to
guard
ills
the
imperial
fire
on
the
great
wall
i
left
rome
for
lalage
sake
by
the
legions
road
to
rimini
she
vowed
her
heart
was
mine
to
take
with
me
and
my
shield
to
rimini
till
the
eagles
flew
from
rimini
and
i
tramped
britain
and
i
tramped
gaul
and
the
pontic
shore
where
the
fall
as
white
as
the
neck
of
lalage
as
cold
as
the
heart
of
lalage
and
i
lost
britain
and
i
lost
gaul
the
voice
seemed
very
cheerful
about
it
i
lost
rome
and
worst
of
all
i
lost
lalage
they
were
standing
by
the
gate
to
far
wood
when
they
heard
this
song
without
a
word
they
hurried
to
their
private
gap
and
wriggled
through
the
hedge
almost
atop
of
a
jay
that
was
feeding
from
puck
hand
said
puck
are
you
looking
for
of
course
dan
answered
only
just
remembered
yesterday
it
is
fair
puck
chuckled
as
he
rose
sorry
but
children
who
spend
the
afternoon
with
me
and
a
roman
centurion
need
a
little
settling
dose
of
magic
before
they
go
to
tea
with
their
governess
ohe
parnesius
he
called
faun
came
the
answer
from
volaterrae
they
could
see
the
shimmer
of
bronze
armour
in
the
and
the
friendly
flash
of
the
great
shield
uplifted
have
driven
out
the
britons
parnesius
laughed
like
a
boy
occupy
their
high
forts
but
rome
is
merciful
you
may
come
up
up
they
three
all
scrambled
was
the
song
you
were
singing
just
now
said
una
as
soon
as
she
had
settled
herself
oh
rimini
it
one
of
the
tunes
that
are
always
being
born
somewhere
in
the
empire
they
run
like
a
pestilence
for
six
months
or
a
year
till
another
one
pleases
the
legions
and
then
they
march
to
that
them
about
the
marching
parnesius
few
people
nowadays
walk
from
end
to
end
of
this
country
said
puck
greater
their
loss
i
know
nothing
better
than
the
long
march
when
your
feet
are
hardened
you
begin
after
the
mists
have
risen
and
you
end
perhaps
an
hour
after
sundown
what
do
you
have
to
eat
dan
asked
promptly
bacon
beans
and
bread
and
whatever
wine
happens
to
be
in
the
but
soldiers
are
born
grumblers
their
very
first
day
out
my
men
complained
of
our
british
corn
they
said
it
was
so
filling
as
the
rough
stuff
that
is
ground
in
the
roman
however
they
had
to
fetch
and
eat
it

sir
richard

talk
about
it
did
and
it
was
old
in
his
day
puck
answered
of
years
old

new
in
mine
said
parnesius
men
looked
at
the
flour
in
their
helmets
as
though
it
had
been
a
nest
of
adders
they
did
it
to
try
my
patience
but
i
addressed
them
and
we
became
friends
to
tell
the
truth
they
taught
me
the
roman
step
you
see
i
only
served
with
auxiliaries
a
legion
pace
is
altogether
different
it
is
a
long
slow
stride
that
never
varies
from
sunrise
to
sunset
rome
race

as
the
proverb
says
miles
in

neither

and
that
how
you
take
the
eagles
through
britain
did
you
meet
any
adventures
said
dan
are
no
adventures
south
the
wall
said
parnesius
worst
thing
that
happened
me
was
having
to
appear
before
a
magistrate
up
north
where
a
wandering
philosopher
had
jeered
at
the
eagles
i
was
able
to
show
that
the
old
man
had
deliberately
blocked
our
road
and
the
magistrate
told
him
out
of
his
own
book
i
believe
that
whatever
his
gods
might
be
he
should
pay
proper
respect
to
caesar
did
you
do
said
dan
on
why
should
i
care
for
such
things
my
business
being
to
reach
my
station
it
took
me
twenty
days
course
the
farther
north
you
go
the
emptier
are
the
roads
at
last
you
fetch
clear
of
the
forests
and
climb
bare
hills
where
wolves
howl
in
the
ruins
of
our
cities
that
have
been
no
more
pretty
girls
no
more
jolly
magistrates
who
knew
your
father
when
he
was
young
and
invite
you
to
stay
with
them
no
news
at
the
temples
and
except
bad
news
of
wild
beasts
there
where
you
meet
hunters
and
trappers
for
the
circuses
prodding
along
chained
bears
and
muzzled
wolves
your
pony
shies
at
them
and
your
men
laugh
houses
change
from
gardened
villas
to
shut
forts
with
of
grey
stone
and
great
sheepfolds
guarded
by
armed
britons
of
the
north
shore
in
the
naked
hills
beyond
the
naked
houses
where
the
shadows
of
the
clouds
play
like
cavalry
charging
you
see
puffs
of
black
smoke
from
the
mines
the
hard
road
goes
on
and
on
and
the
wind
sings
through
your
past
altars
to
legions
and
generals
forgotten
and
broken
statues
of
gods
and
heroes
and
thousands
of
graves
where
the
mountain
foxes
and
hares
peep
at
you
in
summer
freezing
in
winter
is
that
big
purple
heather
country
of
broken
stone
when
you
think
you
are
at
the
world
end
you
see
a
smoke
from
east
to
west
as
far
as
the
eye
can
turn
and
then
under
it
also
as
far
as
the
eye
can
stretch
houses
and
temples
shops
and
theatres
barracks
and
granaries
trickling
along
like
dice
behind
always
behind
one
long
low
rising
and
falling
and
hiding
and
showing
line
of
towers
and
that
is
the
wall
said
the
children
taking
breath
may
well
said
parnesius
men
who
have
followed
the
eagles
since
boyhood
say
nothing
in
the
empire
is
more
wonderful
than
first
sight
of
the
wall
it
just
a
wall
like
the
one
round
the
said
dan
no
it
is
the
wall
along
the
top
are
towers
with
small
towers
between
even
on
the
narrowest
part
of
it
three
men
with
shields
can
walk
abreast
from
to
a
little
curtain
wall
no
higher
than
a
man
neck
runs
along
the
top
of
the
thick
wall
so
that
from
a
distance
you
see
the
helmets
of
the
sentries
sliding
back
and
forth
like
beads
thirty
feet
high
is
the
wall
and
on
the
picts
side
the
north
is
a
ditch
strewn
with
blades
of
old
swords
and
set
in
wood
and
tyres
of
wheels
joined
by
chains
the
little
people
come
there
to
steal
iron
for
their
the
wall
itself
is
not
more
wonderful
than
the
town
behind
it
long
ago
there
were
great
ramparts
and
ditches
on
the
south
side
and
no
one
was
allowed
to
build
there
now
the
ramparts
are
partly
pulled
down
and
built
over
from
end
to
end
of
the
wall
making
a
thin
town
eighty
miles
long
think
of
it
one
roaring
rioting
town
from
ituna
on
the
west
to
segedunum
on
the
cold
eastern
beach
on
one
side
heather
woods
and
ruins
where
picts
hide
and
on
the
other
a
vast
town
long
like
a
snake
and
wicked
like
a
snake
yes
a
snake
basking
beside
a
warm
wall
cohort
i
was
told
lay
at
hunno
where
the
great
north
road
runs
through
the
wall
into
the
province
of
valentia
laughed
scornfully
province
of
valentia
we
followed
the
road
therefore
into
hunno
town
and
stood
astonished
the
place
was
a
fair
a
fair
of
peoples
from
every
corner
of
the
empire
some
were
racing
horses
some
sat
in
some
watched
dogs
baiting
bears
and
many
gathered
in
a
ditch
to
see
cocks
fight
a
boy
not
much
older
than
myself
but
i
could
see
he
was
an
officer
reined
up
before
me
and
asked
what
i
wanted
station
i
said
and
showed
him
my
shield
parnesius
held
up
his
broad
shield
with
its
three
x
like
letters
on
a
omen
said
he
your
cohort
the
next
tower
to
us
but
they
all
at
the
this
is
a
happy
place
come
and
wet
the
eagles
he
meant
to
offer
me
a
drink
i
handed
over
my
men
i
said
i
felt
angry
and
ashamed
you
soon
outgrow
that
sort
of
nonsense
he
answered
but
do
let
me
interfere
with
your
hopes
go
on
to
the
statue
of
roma
dea
you
ca
miss
it
the
main
road
into
valentia
and
he
laughed
and
rode
off
i
could
see
the
statue
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
and
there
i
went
at
some
time
or
other
the
great
north
road
ran
under
it
into
valentia
but
the
far
end
had
been
blocked
up
because
of
the
picts
and
on
the
plaster
a
man
had
scratched
finish
it
was
like
marching
into
a
cave
we
grounded
spears
together
my
little
thirty
and
it
echoed
in
the
barrel
of
the
arch
but
none
came
there
was
a
door
at
one
side
painted
with
our
number
we
prowled
in
and
i
found
a
cook
asleep
and
ordered
him
to
give
us
food
then
i
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
wall
and
looked
out
over
the
pict
country
and
i
thought
said
parnesius
arch
with
finish
on
the
plaster
was
what
shook
me
for
i
was
not
much
more
than
a
boy
a
shame
una
did
you
feel
happy
after
you
had
a
good
stopped
her
with
a
nudge
said
parnesius
the
men
of
the
cohort
i
was
to
command
came
back
unhelmeted
from
the
their
birds
under
their
arms
and
asked
me
who
i
was
no
i
was
not
happy
but
i
made
my
new
cohort
unhappy
too
i
wrote
my
mother
i
was
happy
but
oh
my
friends
he
stretched
arms
over
bare
knees
would
not
wish
my
worst
enemy
to
suffer
as
i
suffered
through
my
first
months
on
the
wall
remember
this
among
the
officers
was
scarcely
one
except
myself
and
i
thought
i
had
lost
the
favour
of
maximus
my
general
scarcely
one
who
had
not
done
something
of
wrong
or
folly
either
he
had
killed
a
man
or
taken
money
or
insulted
the
magistrates
or
blasphemed
the
gods
and
so
had
been
sent
to
the
wall
as
a
from
shame
or
fear
and
the
men
were
as
the
officers
remember
also
that
the
wall
was
manned
by
every
breed
and
race
in
the
empire
no
two
towers
spoke
the
same
tongue
or
worshipped
the
same
gods
in
one
thing
only
we
were
all
equal
no
matter
what
arms
we
had
used
before
we
came
to
the
wall
on
the
wall
we
were
all
archers
like
the
scythians
the
pict
can
not
run
away
from
the
arrow
or
crawl
under
it
he
is
a
bowman
himself
he
knows
suppose
you
were
fighting
picts
all
the
time
said
dan
seldom
fight
i
never
saw
a
fighting
pict
for
half
a
year
the
tame
picts
told
us
they
had
all
gone
north
is
a
tame
pict
said
dan
pict
there
were
many
such
who
speaks
a
few
words
of
our
tongue
and
slips
across
the
wall
to
sell
ponies
and
without
a
horse
and
a
dog
and
a
friend
man
would
perish
the
gods
gave
me
all
three
and
there
is
no
gift
like
friendship
remember
this
parnesius
turned
to
dan
you
become
a
young
man
for
your
fate
will
turn
on
the
first
true
friend
you
make
means
said
puck
grinning
if
you
try
to
make
yourself
a
decent
chap
when
you
young
you
make
rather
decent
friends
when
you
grow
up
if
you
a
beast
you
have
beastly
friends
listen
to
the
pious
parnesius
on
friendship
am
not
pious
answered
i
know
what
goodness
means
and
my
friend
though
he
was
without
hope
was
ten
thousand
times
better
than
i
stop
laughing
faun
youth
eternal
and
cried
puck
as
he
rocked
on
the
branch
above
them
about
your
pertinax
was
that
friend
the
gods
sent
me
the
boy
who
spoke
to
me
when
i
first
came
little
older
than
myself
commanding
the
augusta
victoria
cohort
on
the
tower
next
to
us
and
the
numidians
in
virtue
he
was
far
my
superior
why
was
he
on
the
wall
una
asked
quickly
all
done
something
bad
you
said
so
yourself
was
the
nephew
his
father
had
died
of
a
great
rich
man
in
gaul
who
was
not
always
kind
to
his
mother
when
pertinax
grew
up
he
discovered
this
and
so
his
uncle
shipped
him
off
by
trickery
and
force
to
the
wall
we
came
to
know
each
other
at
a
ceremony
in
our
temple
in
the
dark
it
was
the
explained
to
puck
see
said
puck
and
turned
to
the
children
something
you
would
quite
understand
parnesius
means
he
met
pertinax
in
church
in
the
cave
we
first
met
and
we
were
both
raised
to
the
degree
of
gryphons
together
parnesius
lifted
his
hand
towards
his
neck
for
an
instant
had
been
on
the
wall
two
years
and
knew
the
picts
well
he
taught
me
first
how
to
take
heather
that
said
dan
out
hunting
in
the
pict
country
with
a
tame
pict
you
are
quite
safe
so
long
as
you
are
his
guest
and
wear
a
sprig
of
heather
where
it
can
be
seen
if
you
went
alone
you
would
surely
be
killed
if
you
were
not
smothered
first
in
the
bogs
only
the
picts
know
their
way
about
those
black
and
hidden
bogs
old
allo
the
withered
little
pict
from
whom
we
bought
our
ponies
was
our
special
friend
at
first
we
went
only
to
escape
from
the
terrible
town
and
to
talk
together
about
our
homes
then
he
showed
us
how
to
hunt
wolves
and
those
great
red
deer
with
horns
like
jewish
candlesticks
the
officers
rather
looked
down
on
us
for
doing
this
but
we
preferred
the
heather
to
their
amusements
believe
me
parnesius
turned
again
to
dan
boy
is
safe
from
all
things
that
really
harm
when
he
is
astride
a
pony
or
after
a
deer
do
you
remember
o
faun
he
turned
to
puck
little
altar
i
built
to
the
sylvan
pan
by
the
beyond
the
brook
the
stone
one
with
the
line
from
xenophon
said
puck
in
quite
a
new
voice
what
do
i
know
of
xenophon
that
was
pertinax
after
he
had
shot
his
first
with
an
arrow
by
chance
mine
i
made
of
round
pebbles
in
memory
of
my
first
bear
it
took
me
one
happy
day
to
build
parnesius
faced
the
children
quickly
that
was
how
we
lived
on
the
wall
for
two
years
a
little
scuffling
with
the
picts
and
a
great
deal
of
hunting
with
old
allo
in
the
pict
country
he
called
us
his
children
sometimes
and
we
were
fond
of
him
and
his
barbarians
though
we
never
let
them
paint
us
the
marks
endure
till
you
die
it
done
said
dan
like
tattooing
prick
the
skin
till
the
blood
runs
and
rub
in
coloured
juices
allo
was
painted
blue
green
and
red
from
his
forehead
to
his
ankles
he
said
it
was
part
of
his
religion
he
told
us
about
his
religion
pertinax
was
always
interested
in
such
things
and
as
we
came
to
know
him
well
he
told
us
what
was
happening
in
britain
behind
the
wall
many
things
took
place
behind
us
in
those
days
and
by
the
light
of
the
sun
said
parnesius
earnestly
was
not
much
that
those
little
people
did
not
know
he
told
me
when
maximus
crossed
over
to
gaul
after
he
had
made
himself
emperor
of
britain
and
what
troops
and
emigrants
he
had
taken
with
him
we
did
not
get
the
news
on
the
wall
till
fifteen
days
later
he
told
me
what
troops
maximus
was
taking
out
of
britain
every
month
to
help
him
to
conquer
gaul
and
i
always
found
the
numbers
were
as
he
said
wonderful
and
i
tell
another
strange
thing
he
joined
his
hands
across
his
knees
and
leaned
his
head
on
the
curve
of
the
shield
behind
him
in
the
summer
when
the
first
frosts
begin
and
the
picts
kill
their
bees
we
three
rode
out
after
wolf
with
some
new
hounds
rutilianus
our
general
had
given
us
ten
days
leave
and
we
had
pushed
beyond
the
second
wall
beyond
the
province
of
valentia
into
the
higher
hills
where
there
are
not
even
any
of
old
rome
ruins
we
killed
a
before
noon
and
while
allo
was
skinning
her
he
looked
up
and
said
to
me
when
you
are
captain
of
the
wall
my
child
you
wo
be
able
to
do
this
any
more
might
as
well
have
been
made
prefect
of
lower
gaul
so
i
laughed
and
said
wait
till
i
am
captain
do
wait
said
allo
take
my
advice
and
go
home
both
of
you
have
no
homes
said
pertinax
you
know
that
as
well
as
we
do
we
finished
men
thumbs
down
against
both
of
us
only
men
without
hope
would
risk
their
necks
on
your
ponies
the
old
man
laughed
one
of
those
short
pict
laughs
like
a
fox
barking
on
a
frosty
night
i
fond
of
you
two
he
said
besides
taught
you
what
little
you
know
about
hunting
take
my
advice
and
go
home
ca
i
said
i
out
of
favour
with
my
general
for
one
thing
and
for
another
pertinax
has
an
uncle
do
know
about
his
uncle
said
allo
but
the
trouble
with
you
parnesius
is
that
your
general
thinks
well
of
you
dea
said
pertinax
sitting
up
what
can
you
guess
what
maximus
thinks
you
old
then
you
know
how
near
the
brutes
creep
when
one
is
eating
a
great
jumped
out
behind
us
and
away
our
rested
hounds
tore
after
him
with
us
at
their
tails
he
ran
us
far
out
of
any
country
we
ever
heard
of
straight
as
an
arrow
till
sunset
towards
the
sunset
we
came
at
last
to
long
capes
stretching
into
winding
waters
and
on
a
grey
beach
below
us
we
saw
ships
drawn
up
we
counted
not
roman
galleys
but
the
ships
from
the
north
where
rome
does
not
rule
men
moved
in
the
ships
and
the
sun
flashed
on
their
helmets
winged
helmets
of
the
men
from
the
north
where
rome
does
not
rule
we
watched
and
we
counted
and
we
wondered
for
though
we
had
heard
rumours
concerning
these
winged
hats
as
the
picts
called
them
never
before
had
we
looked
upon
them
away
come
away
said
allo
my
heather
wo
protect
you
here
we
shall
all
be
killed
his
legs
trembled
like
his
voice
back
we
went
back
across
the
heather
under
the
moon
till
it
was
nearly
morning
and
our
poor
beasts
stumbled
on
some
ruins
we
woke
very
stiff
and
cold
allo
was
mixing
the
meal
and
water
one
does
not
light
fires
in
the
pict
country
except
near
a
village
the
little
men
are
always
signalling
to
each
other
with
smokes
and
a
strange
smoke
brings
them
out
buzzing
like
bees
they
can
sting
too
we
saw
last
night
was
a
said
allo
nothing
but
a
do
not
like
lies
on
an
empty
stomach
said
pertinax
i
suppose
he
had
eyes
like
an
eagle
i
suppose
that
is
a
also
he
pointed
to
a
smoke
far
off
on
a
ascending
in
what
we
call
the
picts
call
puff
they
make
it
by
raising
and
dropping
a
wet
hide
on
a
fire
said
allo
pushing
the
platter
back
into
the
bag
that
is
for
you
and
me
your
fate
is
fixed
come
came
when
one
takes
heather
one
must
obey
one
pict
but
that
wretched
smoke
was
twenty
miles
distant
well
over
on
the
east
coast
and
the
day
was
as
hot
as
a
bath
happens
said
allo
while
our
ponies
grunted
along
i
want
you
to
remember
me
shall
not
forget
said
pertinax
you
have
cheated
me
out
of
my
breakfast
what
is
a
handful
of
crushed
oats
to
a
roman
he
said
then
he
laughed
his
laugh
that
was
not
a
laugh
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
a
handful
of
oats
being
crushed
between
the
upper
and
lower
stones
of
a
mill
pertinax
not
a
said
pertinax
a
fool
said
allo
your
gods
and
my
gods
are
threatened
by
strange
gods
and
all
you
can
do
is
to
laugh
men
live
long
i
said
pray
the
gods
that
may
be
true
he
said
but
i
ask
you
again
not
to
forget
me
climbed
the
last
hot
hill
and
looked
out
on
the
eastern
sea
three
or
four
miles
off
there
was
a
small
of
the
north
gaul
pattern
at
anchor
her
down
and
her
sail
half
up
and
below
us
alone
in
a
hollow
holding
his
pony
sat
maximus
emperor
of
britain
he
was
dressed
like
a
hunter
and
he
leaned
on
his
little
stick
but
i
knew
that
back
as
far
as
i
could
see
it
and
i
told
pertinax
madder
than
allo
he
said
it
must
be
the
sun
never
stirred
till
we
stood
before
him
then
he
looked
me
up
and
down
and
said
hungry
again
it
seems
to
be
my
destiny
to
feed
you
whenever
we
meet
i
have
food
here
allo
shall
cook
it
said
allo
a
prince
in
his
own
land
does
not
wait
on
wandering
emperors
i
feed
my
two
children
without
asking
your
leave
he
began
to
blow
up
the
ashes
was
wrong
said
pertinax
we
are
all
mad
speak
up
o
madman
called
emperor
smiled
his
terrible
smile
but
two
years
on
the
wall
do
not
make
a
man
afraid
of
mere
looks
so
i
was
not
afraid
meant
you
parnesius
to
live
and
die
a
centurion
of
the
wall
said
maximus
but
it
seems
from
these
he
fumbled
in
his
breast
you
can
think
as
well
as
draw
he
pulled
out
a
roll
of
letters
i
had
written
to
my
people
full
of
drawings
of
picts
and
bears
and
men
i
had
met
on
the
wall
mother
and
my
sister
always
liked
my
pictures
handed
me
one
that
i
had
called
maximus
soldiers
it
showed
a
row
of
fat
and
our
old
doctor
of
the
hunno
hospital
snuffing
at
them
each
time
that
maximus
had
taken
troops
out
of
britain
to
help
him
to
conquer
gaul
he
used
to
send
the
garrisons
more
wine
to
keep
them
quiet
i
suppose
on
the
wall
we
always
called
a
a
maximus
oh
yes
and
i
had
drawn
them
in
imperial
helmets
long
since
he
went
on
men
names
were
sent
up
to
caesar
for
smaller
jokes
than
this
caesar
said
pertinax
but
you
forget
that
was
before
i
your
friend
friend
became
such
a
good
did
not
actually
point
his
at
maximus
but
balanced
it
on
his
palm
so
was
speaking
of
time
past
said
maximus
never
fluttering
an
eyelid
nowadays
one
is
only
too
pleased
to
find
boys
who
can
think
for
themselves
and
their
friends
he
nodded
at
pertinax
your
father
lent
me
the
letters
parnesius
so
you
run
no
risk
from
me
whatever
said
pertinax
and
rubbed
the
on
his
sleeve
have
been
forced
to
reduce
the
garrisons
in
britain
because
i
need
troops
in
gaul
now
i
come
to
take
troops
from
the
wall
itself
said
he
wish
you
joy
of
us
said
pertinax
we
the
last
sweepings
of
the
empire
the
men
without
hope
myself
i
sooner
trust
condemned
criminals
think
so
he
said
quite
seriously
but
it
will
only
be
till
i
win
gaul
one
must
always
risk
one
life
or
one
soul
or
peace
or
some
little
thing
passed
round
the
fire
with
the
sizzling
deer
meat
he
served
us
two
first
said
maximus
waiting
his
turn
i
perceive
you
are
in
your
own
country
well
you
deserve
it
they
tell
me
you
have
quite
a
following
among
the
picts
parnesius
have
hunted
with
them
i
said
maybe
i
have
a
few
friends
among
the
heather
is
the
only
armoured
man
of
you
all
who
understands
us
said
allo
and
he
began
a
long
speech
about
our
virtues
and
how
we
had
saved
one
of
his
grandchildren
from
a
wolf
the
year
before
you
said
una
but
that
was
neither
here
nor
there
the
little
green
man
orated
like
a
like
cicero
he
made
us
out
to
be
magnificent
fellows
maximus
never
took
his
eyes
off
our
faces
he
said
i
have
heard
allo
on
you
i
wish
to
hear
you
on
the
picts
told
him
as
much
as
i
knew
and
pertinax
helped
me
out
there
is
never
harm
in
a
pict
if
you
but
take
the
trouble
to
find
out
what
he
wants
their
real
grievance
against
us
came
from
our
burning
their
heather
the
whole
garrison
of
the
wall
moved
out
twice
a
year
and
solemnly
burned
the
heather
for
ten
miles
north
rutilianus
our
general
called
it
clearing
the
country
the
picts
of
course
scampered
away
and
all
we
did
was
to
destroy
their
in
the
summer
and
ruin
their
in
the
spring
quite
true
said
allo
how
can
we
make
our
holy
if
you
burn
our
talked
long
maximus
asking
keen
questions
that
showed
he
knew
much
and
had
thought
more
about
the
picts
he
said
presently
to
me
if
i
gave
you
the
old
province
of
valentia
to
govern
could
you
keep
the
picts
contented
till
i
won
gaul
stand
away
so
that
you
do
not
see
allo
face
and
speak
your
own
thoughts
i
said
you
can
not
remake
that
province
the
picts
have
been
free
too
long
them
their
village
councils
and
let
them
furnish
their
own
soldiers
he
said
you
i
am
sure
would
hold
the
reins
very
lightly
even
then
no
i
said
at
least
not
now
they
have
been
too
oppressed
by
us
to
trust
anything
with
a
roman
name
for
years
and
years
heard
old
allo
behind
me
mutter
good
child
what
do
you
recommend
said
maximus
to
keep
the
north
quiet
till
i
win
gaul
the
picts
alone
i
said
stop
the

improvident
little
animals

shipload

cheating

pertinax
and
allow
them
to
come
to
our
hospitals
when
they
are
sick

maximus
if
parnesius
brought
them
in
said
allo
i
could
show
you
twenty
picts
within
twenty
miles
of
here
but
parnesius
must
stay
with
them
in
hospital
else
they
would
go
mad
with
fear
see
said
maximus
like
everything
else
in
the
world

man

that
one
man

must
know
what
the
lower
millstone
means
to
do
these
boys
have
spoken
the
truth
as
far
as
they
know
it
i
a
prince
will
tell
you
the
rest
i
am
troubled
about
the
men
of
the
north
he
squatted
like
a
hare
in
the
heather
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
also
said
maximus
or
i
should
not
be
here
said
allo
long
and
long
ago
the
winged
hats
he
meant
the
northmen
came
to
our
beaches
and
said
falls
push
her
down
we
fought
you
you
sent
men
we
were
beaten
after
that
we
said
to
the
winged
hats

liars
make
our
men
alive
that
rome
killed
and
we
will
believe
you
they
went
away
ashamed
now
they
come
back
bold
and
they
tell
the
old
tale
which
we
begin
to
believe
that
rome
falls
me
three
years
peace
on
the
wall
cried
maximus
and
i
will
show
you
and
all
the
ravens
how
they
lie
i
wish
it
too
i
wish
to
save
what
is
left
of
the
corn
from
the
millstones
but
you
shoot
us
picts
when
we
come
to
borrow
a
little
iron
from
the
iron
ditch
you
burn
our
heather
which
is
all
our
crop
you
trouble
us
with
your
great
catapults
then
you
hide
behind
the
wall
and
scorch
us
with
greek
fire
how
can
i
keep
my
young
men
from
listening
to
the
winged
hats
in
winter
especially
when
we
are
hungry
my
young
men
will
say
can
neither
fight
nor
rule
she
is
taking
her
men
out
of
britain
the
winged
hats
will
help
us
to
push
down
the
wall
let
us
show
them
the
secret
roads
across
the
bogs
do
i
want
that
no
he
spat
like
an
adder
i
would
keep
the
secrets
of
my
people
though
i
were
burned
alive
my
two
children
here
have
spoken
truth
leave
us
picts
alone
comfort
us
and
cherish
us
and
feed
us
from
far
off
with
the
hand
behind
the
back
parnesius
understands
us
let
him
have
rule
on
the
wall
and
i
will
hold
my
young
men
quiet
for
he
ticked
it
off
on
his
fingers
one
year
easily
the
next
year
not
so
easily
the
third
year
perhaps
see
i
give
you
three
years
if
then
you
do
not
show
us
that
rome
is
strong
in
men
and
terrible
in
arms
the
winged
hats
i
tell
you
will
sweep
down
the
wall
from
either
sea
till
they
meet
in
the
middle
and
you
will
go
i
shall
not
grieve
over
that
but
well
i
know
tribe
never
helps
tribe
except
for
one
price
we
picts
will
go
too
the
winged
hats
will
grind
us
to
this
he
tossed
a
handful
of
dust
in
the
air
roma
dea
said
maximus
half
aloud
it
is
always
one
work
always
and
everywhere
and
one
man
life
said
allo
you
are
emperor
but
not
a
god
you
may
die
have
thought
of
that
too
said
he
very
good
if
this
wind
holds
i
shall
be
at
the
east
end
of
the
wall
by
morning
tomorrow
then
i
shall
see
you
two
when
i
inspect
and
i
will
make
you
captains
of
the
wall
for
this
work
instant
caesar
said
pertinax
all
men
have
their
price
i
am
not
bought
yet
you
also
begin
to
bargain
so
early
said
maximus
well
me
justice
against
my
uncle
icenus
the
duumvir
of
divio
in
gaul
he
said
a
life
i
thought
it
would
be
money
or
an
office
certainly
you
shall
have
him
write
his
name
on
these
tablets
on
the
red
side
the
other
is
for
the
living
and
maximus
held
out
his
tablets
is
of
no
use
to
me
dead
said
pertinax
my
mother
is
a
widow
i
am
far
off
i
am
not
sure
he
pays
her
all
her
dowry
matter
my
arm
is
reasonably
long
we
will
look
through
your
uncle
accounts
in
due
time
now
farewell
till
tomorrow
o
captains
of
the
wall
saw
him
grow
small
across
the
heather
as
he
walked
to
the
galley
there
were
picts
scores
each
side
of
him
hidden
behind
stones
he
never
looked
left
or
right
he
sailed
away
southerly
full
spread
before
the
evening
breeze
and
when
we
had
watched
him
out
to
sea
we
were
silent
we
understood
that
earth
bred
few
men
like
to
this
man
allo
brought
the
ponies
and
held
them
for
us
to
mount
a
thing
he
had
never
done
before
awhile
said
pertinax
and
he
made
a
little
altar
of
cut
turf
and
strewed
atop
and
laid
upon
it
a
letter
from
a
girl
in
gaul
do
you
do
o
my
friend
i
said
sacrifice
to
my
dead
youth
he
answered
and
when
the
flames
had
consumed
the
letter
he
ground
them
out
with
his
heel
then
we
rode
back
to
that
wall
of
which
we
were
to
be
captains
parnesius
stopped
the
children
sat
still
not
even
asking
if
that
were
all
the
tale
puck
beckoned
and
pointed
the
way
out
of
the
wood
he
whispered
you
must
go
now
have
made
him
angry
have
we
said
una
looks
so
far
off
and
and
thinky
your
heart
no
wait
till
tomorrow
it
wo
be
long
remember
you
been
playing
lays
of
ancient
rome
and
as
soon
as
they
had
scrambled
through
their
gap
where
oak
ash
and
thorn
grew
that
was
all
they
remembered
a
song
to
mithras
mithras
god
of
the
morning
our
trumpets
waken
the
wall
is
above
the
nations
but
thou
art
over
all
now
as
the
names
are
answered
and
the
guards
are
marched
away
mithras
also
a
soldier
give
us
strength
for
the
day
mithras
god
of
the
noontide
the
heather
swims
in
the
heat
our
helmets
scorch
our
foreheads
our
sandals
burn
our
feet
now
in
the
ungirt
hour
now
ere
we
blink
and
drowse
mithras
also
a
soldier
keep
us
true
to
our
vows
mithras
god
of
the
sunset
low
on
the
western
main
thou

immortal
immortal
to
rise
again
now
when
the
watch
is
ended
now
when
the
wine
is
drawn
mithras
also
a
soldier
keep
us
pure
till
the
dawn
mithras
god
of

here
where
the
great

roads
thou
hast
fashioned
all
of
them

to
the
light
mithras
also
a
soldier
teach
us
to
die
aright
the
winged
hats
the
next
day
happened
to
be
what
they
called
a
wild
afternoon
father
and
mother
went
out
to
pay
calls
miss
blake
went
for
a
ride
on
her
bicycle
and
they
were
left
all
alone
till
eight
when
they
had
seen
their
dear
parents
and
their
dear
preceptress
politely
off
the
premises
they
got
a
full
of
raspberries
from
the
gardener
and
a
wild
tea
from
ellen
they
ate
the
raspberries
to
prevent
their
squashing
and
they
meant
to
divide
the
with
three
cows
down
at
the
theatre
but
they
came
across
a
dead
hedgehog
which
they
simply
had
to
bury
and
the
leaf
was
too
useful
to
waste
then
they
went
on
to
the
forge
and
found
old
hobden
the
hedger
at
home
with
his
son
the
bee
boy
who
is
not
quite
right
in
his
head
but
who
can
pick
up
swarms
of
bees
in
his
naked
hands
and
the
bee
boy
told
them
the
rhyme
about
the
i
had
eyes
as
i
could
see
no
mortal
man
would
trouble
me
they
all
had
tea
together
by
the
hives
and
hobden
said
the
which
ellen
had
given
them
was
almost
as
good
as
what
his
wife
used
to
make
and
he
showed
them
how
to
set
a
wire
at
the
right
height
for
hares
they
knew
about
rabbits
already
then
they
climbed
up
long
ditch
into
the
lower
end
of
far
wood
this
is
sadder
and
darker
than
the
volaterrae
end
because
of
an
old
full
of
black
water
where
weepy
hairy
moss
hangs
round
the
stumps
of
the
willows
and
alders
but
the
birds
come
to
perch
on
the
dead
branches
and
hobden
says
that
the
bitter
is
a
sort
of
medicine
for
sick
animals
they
sat
down
on
a
felled
in
the
shadows
of
the
beech
undergrowth
and
were
looping
the
wires
hobden
had
given
them
when
they
saw
parnesius
quietly
you
came
una
moving
up
to
make
room
puck
faun
and
i
have
disputed
whether
it
is
better
that
i
should
tell
you
all
my
tale
or
leave
it
untold
he
replied
only
said
that
if
he
told
it
as
it
happened
you
would
understand
it
said
puck
jumping
up
like
a
squirrel
from
behind
the
log
do
understand
all
of
it
said
una
i
like
hearing
about
the
little
picts
i
ca
understand
said
dan
how
maximus
knew
all
about
the
picts
when
he
was
over
in
gaul
who
makes
himself
emperor
anywhere
must
know
everything
everywhere
said
parnesius
had
this
much
from
maximus
mouth
after
the
games
what
games
said
dan
parnesius
stretched
his
arm
out
stiffly
thumb
pointed
to
the
ground
that
sort
of
game
he
said
were
two
days
games
in
his
honour
when
he
landed
all
unexpected
at
segedunum
on
the
east
end
of
the
wall
yes
the
day
after
we
had
met
him
we
held
two
games
but
i
think
the
greatest
risk
was
run
not
by
the
poor
wretches
on
the
sand
but
by
maximus
in
the
old
days
the
legions
kept
silence
before
their
emperor
so
did
not
we
you
could
hear
the
solid
roar
run
west
along
the
wall
as
his
chair
was
carried
rocking
through
the
crowds
the
garrison
beat
round
him
clamouring
clowning
asking
for
pay
for
change
of
quarters
for
anything
that
came
into
their
wild
heads
that
chair
was
like
a
little
boat
among
waves
dipping
and
falling
but
always
rising
again
after
one
had
shut
the
eyes
parnesius
shivered
they
angry
with
him
said
dan
more
angry
than
wolves
in
a
cage
when
their
trainer
walks
among
them
if
he
had
turned
his
back
an
instant
or
for
an
instant
had
ceased
to
hold
their
eyes
there
would
have
been
another
emperor
made
on
the
wall
that
hour
was
it
not
so
faun
it
was
so
it
always
will
be
said
puck
in
the
evening
his
messenger
came
for
us
and
we
followed
to
the
temple
of
victory
where
he
lodged
with
rutilianus
the
general
of
the
wall
i
had
hardly
seen
the
general
before
but
he
always
gave
me
leave
when
i
wished
to
take
heather
he
was
a
great
glutton
and
kept
five
asian
cooks
and
he
came
of
a
family
that
believed
in
oracles
we
could
smell
his
good
dinner
when
we
entered
but
the
tables
were
empty
he
lay
snorting
on
a
couch
maximus
sat
apart
among
long
rolls
of
accounts
then
the
doors
were
shut
are
your
men
said
maximus
to
the
general
who
propped
his
open
with
his
gouty
fingers
and
stared
at
us
like
a
fish
shall
know
them
again
caesar
said
rutilianus
very
good
said
maximus
now
hear
you
are
not
to
move
man
or
shield
on
the
wall
except
as
these
boys
shall
tell
you
you
will
do
nothing
except
eat
without
their
permission
they
are
the
head
and
arms
you
are
the
belly
caesar
pleases
the
old
man
grunted
if
my
pay
and
profits
are
not
cut
you
may
make
my
ancestors
oracle
my
master
rome
has
been
rome
has
been
then
he
turned
on
his
side
to
sleep
has
it
said
maximus
we
will
get
to
what
i
need
unrolled
full
copies
of
the
number
of
men
and
supplies
on
the
wall
down
to
the
sick
that
very
day
in
hunno
hospital
oh
but
i
groaned
when
his
pen
marked
off
detachment
after
detachment
of
our
best
of
our
least
worthless
men
he
took
two
towers
of
our
scythians
two
of
our
north
british
auxiliaries
two
numidian
cohorts
the
dacians
all
and
half
the
belgians
it
was
like
an
eagle
pecking
a
carcass
now
how
many
catapults
have
you
he
turned
up
a
new
list
but
pertinax
laid
his
open
hand
there
caesar
said
he
do
not
tempt
the
gods
too
far
take
men
or
engines
but
not
both
else
we
refuse
said
una
catapults
of
the
wall
huge
things
forty
feet
high
to
the
head
firing
nets
of
raw
stone
or
forged
bolts
nothing
can
stand
against
them
he
left
us
our
catapults
at
last
but
he
took
a
half
of
our
men
without
pity
we
were
a
shell
when
he
rolled
up
the
lists
caesar
we
about
to
die
salute
you
said
pertinax
laughing
if
any
enemy
even
leans
against
the
wall
now
it
will
tumble
me
the
three
years
allo
spoke
of
he
answered
and
you
shall
have
twenty
thousand
men
of
your
own
choosing
up
here
but
now
it
is
a
gamble
a
game
played
against
the
gods
and
the
stakes
are
britain
gaul
and
perhaps
rome
you
play
on
my
side
will
play
caesar
i
said
for
i
had
never
met
a
man
like
this
man
good
tomorrow
said
he
i
proclaim
you
captains
of
the
wall
before
the
troops
we
went
into
the
moonlight
where
they
were
cleaning
the
ground
after
the
games
we
saw
great
roma
dea
atop
of
the
wall
the
frost
on
her
helmet
and
her
spear
pointed
towards
the
north
star
we
saw
the
twinkle
of
all
along
the
and
the
line
of
the
black
catapults
growing
smaller
and
smaller
in
the
distance
all
these
things
we
knew
till
we
were
weary
but
that
night
they
seemed
very
strange
to
us
because
the
next
day
we
knew
we
were
to
be
their
masters
men
took
the
news
well
but
when
maximus
went
away
with
half
our
strength
and
we
had
to
spread
ourselves
into
the
emptied
towers
and
the
townspeople
complained
that
trade
would
be
ruined
and
the
autumn
gales
blew
it
was
dark
days
for
us
two
here
pertinax
was
more
than
my
right
hand
being
born
and
bred
among
the
great
country
houses
in
gaul
he
knew
the
proper
words
to
address
to
all
from
centurions
to
those
dogs
of
the
third
the
libyans
and
he
spoke
to
each
as
though
that
man
were
as
as
himself
now
i
saw
so
strongly
what
things
were
needed
to
be
done
that
i
forgot
things
are
only
accomplished
by
means
of
men
that
was
a
mistake
feared
nothing
from
the
picts
at
least
for
that
year
but
allo
warned
me
that
the
winged
hats
would
soon
come
in
from
the
sea
at
each
end
of
the
wall
to
prove
to
the
picts
how
weak
we
were
so
i
made
ready
in
haste
and
none
too
soon
i
shifted
our
best
men
to
the
ends
of
the
wall
and
set
up
screened
catapults
by
the
beach
the
winged
hats
would
drive
in
before
the
ten
or
twenty
boats
at
a
time
on
segedunum
or
ituna
according
as
the
wind
blew
a
ship
coming
in
to
land
men
must
furl
her
sail
if
you
wait
till
you
see
her
men
gather
up
the
sail
foot
your
catapults
can
jerk
a
net
of
loose
stones
bolts
only
cut
through
the
cloth
into
the
bag
of
it
then
she
turns
over
and
the
sea
makes
everything
clean
again
a
few
men
may
come
ashore
but
very
few
it
was
not
hard
work
except
the
waiting
on
the
beach
in
blowing
sand
and
snow
and
that
was
how
we
dealt
with
the
winged
hats
that
winter
in
the
spring
when
the
east
winds
blow
like
they
gathered
again
off
segedunum
with
many
ships
allo
told
me
they
would
never
rest
till
they
had
taken
a
tower
in
open
fight
certainly
they
fought
in
the
open
we
dealt
with
them
thoroughly
through
a
long
day
and
when
all
was
finished
one
man
dived
clear
of
the
wreckage
of
his
ship
and
swam
towards
shore
i
waited
and
a
wave
tumbled
him
at
my
feet
i
stooped
i
saw
he
wore
such
a
medal
as
i
wear
parnesius
raised
his
hand
to
his
neck
when
he
could
speak
i
addressed
him
a
certain
question
which
can
only
be
answered
in
a
certain
manner
he
answered
with
the
necessary
word
the
word
that
belongs
to
the
degree
of
gryphons
in
the
science
of
mithras
my
god
i
put
my
shield
over
him
till
he
could
stand
up
you
see
i
am
not
short
but
he
was
a
head
taller
than
i
he
said
what
now
i
said
at
your
pleasure
my
brother
to
stay
or
go
looked
out
across
the
surf
there
remained
one
ship
unhurt
beyond
range
of
our
catapults
i
checked
the
catapults
and
he
waved
her
in
she
came
as
a
hound
comes
to
a
master
when
she
was
yet
a
hundred
paces
from
the
beach
he
flung
back
his
hair
and
swam
out
they
hauled
him
in
and
went
away
i
knew
that
those
who
worship
mithras
are
many
and
of
all
races
so
i
did
not
think
much
more
upon
the
matter
month
later
i
saw
allo
with
his
horses
by
the
temple
of
pan
o
faun
and
he
gave
me
a
great
necklace
of
gold
studded
with
coral
first
i
thought
it
was
a
bribe
from
some
tradesman
in
the
town
meant
for
old
rutilianus
nay
said
allo
this
is
a
gift
from
amal
that
winged
hat
whom
you
saved
on
the
beach
he
says
you
are
a
man
is
a
man
too
tell
him
i
can
wear
his
gift
i
answered
amal
is
a
young
fool
but
as
sensible
men
your
emperor
is
doing
such
great
things
in
gaul
that
the
winged
hats
are
anxious
to
be
his
friends
or
better
still
the
friends
of
his
servants
they
think
you
and
pertinax
could
lead
them
to
victories
allo
looked
at
me
like
a
raven
i
said
you
are
the
corn
between
the
two
millstones
be
content
if
they
grind
evenly
and
do
thrust
your
hand
between
them
said
allo
i
hate
rome
and
the
winged
hats
equally
but
if
the
winged
hats
thought
that
some
day
you
and
pertinax
might
join
them
against
maximus
they
would
leave
you
in
peace
while
you
considered
time
is
what
we
need
you
and
i
and
maximus
let
me
carry
a
pleasant
message
back
to
the
winged
hats
something
for
them
to
make
a
council
over
we
barbarians
are
all
alike
we
sit
up
half
the
night
to
discuss
anything
a
roman
says
eh
have
no
men
we
must
fight
with
words
said
pertinax
leave
it
to
allo
and
me
allo
carried
word
back
to
the
winged
hats
that
we
would
not
fight
them
if
they
did
not
fight
us
and
they
i
think
they
were
a
little
tired
of
losing
men
in
the
sea
agreed
to
a
sort
of
truce
i
believe
allo
who
being
a
loved
lies
also
told
them
we
might
some
day
rise
against
maximus
as
maximus
had
risen
against
rome
they
permitted
the
which
i
sent
to
the
picts
to
pass
north
that
season
without
harm
therefore
the
picts
were
well
fed
that
winter
and
since
they
were
in
some
sort
my
children
i
was
glad
of
it
we
had
only
two
thousand
men
on
the
wall
and
i
wrote
many
times
to
maximus
and
begged
prayed
him
to
send
me
only
one
cohort
of
my
old
north
british
troops
he
could
not
spare
them
he
needed
them
to
win
more
victories
in
gaul
came
news
that
he
had
defeated
and
slain
the
emperor
gratian
and
thinking
he
must
now
be
secure
i
wrote
again
for
men
he
answered
you
will
learn
that
i
have
at
last
settled
accounts
with
the
pup
gratian
there
was
no
need
that
he
should
have
died
but
he
became
confused
and
lost
his
head
which
is
a
bad
thing
to
befall
any
emperor
tell
your
father
i
am
content
to
drive
two
mules
only
for
unless
my
old
general
son
thinks
himself
destined
to
destroy
me
i
shall
rest
emperor
of
gaul
and
britain
and
then
you
my
two
children
will
presently
get
all
the
men
you
need
just
now
i
can
spare
none
did
he
mean
by
his
general
son
said
dan
meant
theodosius
emperor
of
rome
who
was
the
son
of
theodosius
the
general
under
whom
maximus
had
fought
in
the
old
pict
war
the
two
men
never
loved
each
other
and
when
gratian
made
the
younger
theodosius
emperor
of
the
east
at
least
so
i
heard
maximus
carried
on
the
war
to
the
second
generation
it
was
his
fate
and
it
was
his
fall
but
theodosius
the
emperor
is
a
good
man
as
i
know
parnesius
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
continued
wrote
back
to
maximus
that
though
we
had
peace
on
the
wall
i
should
be
happier
with
a
few
more
men
and
some
new
catapults
he
answered
you
must
live
a
little
longer
under
the
shadow
of
my
victories
till
i
can
see
what
young
theodosius
intends
he
may
welcome
me
as
a
or
he
may
be
preparing
an
army
in
either
case
i
can
not
spare
men
just
now
he
was
always
saying
that
cried
una
was
true
he
did
not
make
excuses
but
thanks
as
he
said
to
the
news
of
his
victories
we
had
no
trouble
on
the
wall
for
a
long
long
time
the
picts
grew
fat
as
their
own
sheep
among
the
heather
and
as
many
of
my
men
as
lived
were
well
exercised
in
their
weapons
yes
the
wall
looked
strong
for
myself
i
knew
how
weak
we
were
i
knew
that
if
even
a
false
rumour
of
any
defeat
to
maximus
broke
loose
among
the
winged
hats
they
might
come
down
in
earnest
and
then
the
wall
must
go
for
the
picts
i
never
cared
but
in
those
years
i
learned
something
of
the
strength
of
the
winged
hats
they
increased
their
strength
every
day
but
i
could
not
increase
my
men
maximus
had
emptied
britain
behind
us
and
i
felt
myself
to
be
a
man
with
a
rotten
stick
standing
before
a
broken
fence
to
turn
bulls
my
friends
we
lived
on
the
wall
waiting
waiting
waiting
for
the
men
that
maximus
never
sent
he
wrote
that
he
was
preparing
an
army
against
theodosius
he
wrote
and
pertinax
read
it
over
my
shoulder
in
our
quarters
tell
your
father
that
my
destiny
orders
me
to
drive
three
mules
or
be
torn
in
pieces
by
them
i
hope
within
a
year
to
finish
with
theodosius
son
of
theodosius
once
and
for
all
then
you
shall
have
britain
to
rule
and
pertinax
if
he
chooses
gaul
today
i
wish
strongly
you
were
with
me
to
beat
my
auxiliaries
into
shape
do
not
i
pray
you
believe
any
rumour
of
my
sickness
i
have
a
little
evil
in
my
old
body
which
i
shall
cure
by
riding
swiftly
into
rome
pertinax
it
is
finished
with
maximus
he
writes
as
a
man
without
hope
i
a
man
without
hope
can
see
this
what
does
he
add
at
the
bottom
of
the
roll
pertinax
i
have
met
his
late
uncle
the
duumvir
of
divio
and
that
he
accounted
to
me
quite
truthfully
for
all
his
mother
monies
i
have
sent
her
with
a
fitting
escort
for
she
is
the
mother
of
a
hero
to
nicaea
where
the
climate
is
warm
is
proof
said
pertinax
nicaea
is
not
far
by
sea
from
rome
a
woman
there
could
take
ship
and
fly
to
rome
in
time
of
war
yes
maximus
foresees
his
death
and
is
fulfilling
his
promises
one
by
one
but
i
am
glad
my
uncle
met
him
think
blackly
today
i
asked
think
truth
the
gods
weary
of
the
play
we
have
played
against
them
theodosius
will
destroy
maximus
it
is
finished
you
write
him
that
i
said
what
i
shall
write
he
answered
and
he
took
pen
and
wrote
a
letter
cheerful
as
the
light
of
day
tender
as
a
woman
and
full
of
jests
even
i
reading
over
his
shoulder
took
comfort
from
it
till
i
saw
his
face
now
he
said
sealing
it
we
be
two
dead
men
my
brother
let
us
go
to
the
temple
prayed
awhile
to
mithras
where
we
had
many
times
prayed
before
after
that
we
lived
day
by
day
among
evil
rumours
till
winter
came
again
happened
one
morning
that
we
rode
to
the
east
shore
and
found
on
the
beach
a
man
half
frozen
bound
to
some
broken
planks
turning
him
over
we
saw
by
his
that
he
was
a
goth
of
an
eastern
legion
suddenly
he
opened
his
eyes
and
cried
loudly
he
is
dead
the
letters
were
with
me
but
the
winged
hats
sank
the
ship
so
saying
he
died
between
our
hands
asked
not
who
was
dead
we
knew
we
raced
before
the
driving
snow
to
hunno
thinking
perhaps
allo
might
be
there
we
found
him
already
at
our
stables
and
he
saw
by
our
faces
what
we
had
heard
was
in
a
tent
by
the
sea
he
stammered
he
was
beheaded
by
theodosius
he
sent
a
letter
to
you
written
while
he
waited
to
be
slain
the
winged
hats
met
the
ship
and
took
it
the
news
is
running
through
the
heather
like
fire
blame
me
not
i
can
not
hold
back
my
young
men
any
more
would
we
could
say
as
much
for
our
men
said
pertinax
laughing
but
gods
be
praised
they
can
not
run
away
do
you
do
said
allo
i
bring
an
order
a
message
from
the
winged
hats
that
you
join
them
with
your
men
and
march
south
to
plunder
britain
grieves
me
said
pertinax
but
we
are
stationed
here
to
stop
that
thing
i
carry
back
such
an
answer
they
will
kill
me
said
allo
i
always
promised
the
winged
hats
that
you
would
rise
when
maximus
fell
i
i
did
not
think
he
could
fall
my
poor
barbarian
said
pertinax
still
laughing
well
you
have
sold
us
too
many
good
ponies
to
be
thrown
back
to
your
friends
we
will
make
you
a
prisoner
although
you
are
an
ambassador
that
will
be
best
said
allo
holding
out
a
halter
we
bound
him
lightly
for
he
was
an
old
man
the
winged
hats
may
come
to
look
for
you
and
that
will
give
us
more
time
see
how
the
habit
of
playing
for
time
sticks
to
a
man
said
pertinax
as
he
tied
the
rope
i
said
time
may
help
if
maximus
wrote
us
a
letter
while
he
was
a
prisoner
theodosius
must
have
sent
the
ship
that
brought
it
if
he
can
send
ships
he
can
send
men
will
that
profit
us
said
pertinax
we
serve
maximus
not
theodosius
even
if
by
some
miracle
of
the
gods
theodosius
down
south
sent
and
saved
the
wall
we
could
not
expect
more
than
the
death
maximus
died
concerns
us
to
defend
the
wall
no
matter
what
emperor
dies
or
makes
die
i
said
is
worthy
of
your
brother
the
philosopher
said
pertinax
myself
i
am
without
hope
so
i
do
not
say
solemn
and
stupid
things
rouse
the
wall
armed
the
wall
from
end
to
end
we
told
the
officers
that
there
was
a
rumour
of
maximus
death
which
might
bring
down
the
winged
hats
but
we
were
sure
even
if
it
were
true
that
theodosius
for
the
sake
of
britain
would
send
us
help
therefore
we
must
stand
fast
my
friends
it
is
above
all
things
strange
to
see
how
men
bear
ill
news
often
the
strongest
till
then
become
the
weakest
while
the
weakest
as
it
were
reach
up
and
steal
strength
from
the
gods
so
it
was
with
us
yet
my
pertinax
by
his
jests
and
his
courtesy
and
his
labours
had
put
heart
and
training
into
our
poor
numbers
during
the
past
years
more
than
i
should
have
thought
possible
even
our
libyan
cohort
the
third
stood
up
in
their
padded
cuirasses
and
did
not
whimper
three
days
came
seven
chiefs
and
elders
of
the
winged
hats
among
them
was
that
tall
young
man
amal
whom
i
had
met
on
the
beach
and
he
smiled
when
he
saw
my
necklace
we
made
them
welcome
for
they
were
ambassadors
we
showed
them
allo
alive
but
bound
they
thought
we
had
killed
him
and
i
saw
it
would
not
have
vexed
them
if
we
had
allo
saw
it
too
and
it
vexed
him
then
in
our
quarters
at
hunno
we
came
to
council
said
that
rome
was
falling
and
that
we
must
join
them
they
offered
me
all
south
britain
to
govern
after
they
had
taken
a
tribute
out
of
it
answered
patience
this
wall
is
not
weighed
off
like
plunder
give
me
proof
that
my
general
is
dead
said
one
elder
prove
to
us
that
he
lives
and
another
said
cunningly
what
will
you
give
us
if
we
read
you
his
last
words
are
not
merchants
to
bargain
cried
amal
moreover
i
owe
this
man
my
life
he
shall
have
his
proof
he
threw
across
to
me
a
letter
well
i
knew
the
seal
from
maximus
took
this
out
of
the
ship
we
sank
he
cried
i
can
not
read
but
i
know
one
sign
at
least
which
makes
me
believe
he
showed
me
a
dark
stain
on
the
outer
roll
that
my
heavy
heart
perceived
was
the
valiant
blood
of
maximus
said
amal
read
and
then
let
us
hear
whose
servants
you
are
pertinax
very
softly
after
he
had
looked
through
it
i
will
read
it
all
listen
barbarians
he
read
that
which
i
have
carried
next
my
heart
ever
since
parnesius
drew
from
his
neck
a
folded
and
spotted
piece
of
parchment
and
began
in
a
hushed
voice
parnesius
and
pertinax
the
not
unworthy
captains
of
the
wall
from
maximus
once
emperor
of
gaul
and
britain
now
prisoner
waiting
death
by
the
sea
in
the
camp
of
theodosius
greeting
and
goodbye
said
young
amal
there
is
your
proof
you
must
join
us
now
looked
long
and
silently
at
him
till
that
fair
man
blushed
like
a
girl
then
read
pertinax
have
joyfully
done
much
evil
in
my
life
to
those
who
have
wished
me
evil
but
if
ever
i
did
any
evil
to
you
two
i
repent
and
i
ask
your
forgiveness
the
three
mules
which
i
strove
to
drive
have
torn
me
in
pieces
as
your
father
prophesied
the
naked
swords
wait
at
the
tent
door
to
give
me
the
death
i
gave
to
gratian
therefore
i
your
general
and
your
emperor
send
you
free
and
honourable
dismissal
from
my
service
which
you
entered
not
for
money
or
office
but
as
it
makes
me
warm
to
believe
because
you
loved
me
the
light
of
the
sun
amal
broke
in
this
was
in
some
sort
a
man
we
may
have
been
mistaken
in
his
servants
pertinax
read
on
you
gave
me
the
time
for
which
i
asked
if
i
have
failed
to
use
it
do
not
lament
we
have
gambled
very
splendidly
against
the
gods
but
they
hold
weighted
dice
and
i
must
pay
the
forfeit
remember
i
have
been
but
rome
is
and
rome
will
be
tell
pertinax

my
remembrances

your
father
and
to
your
mother
whose
friendship
was
great
gain
to
me
give
also
to
my
little
picts
and
to
the
winged
hats
such
messages
as
their
thick
heads
can
understand
i
would
have
sent
you
three
legions
this
very
day
if
all
had
gone
aright
do
not
forget
me
we
have
worked
together
farewell
farewell
farewell
that
was
my
last
letter
the
children
heard
the
parchment
crackle
as
parnesius
returned
it
to
its
place
was
mistaken
said
amal
the
servants
of
such
a
man
will
sell
nothing
except
over
the
sword
i
am
glad
of
it
he
held
out
his
hand
to
me
maximus
has
given
you
your
dismissal
said
an
elder
you
are
certainly
free
to
serve
or
to
rule
whom
you
please
join
do
not
follow
join
us
thank
you
said
pertinax
but
maximus
tells
us
to
give
you
such
messages
as
pardon
me
but
i
use
his
words
your
thick
heads
can
understand
he
pointed
through
the
door
to
the
foot
of
a
catapult
wound
up
understand
said
an
elder
the
wall
must
be
won
at
a
price
grieves
me
said
pertinax
laughing
but
so
it
must
be
won
and
he
gave
them
of
our
best
southern
wine
drank
and
wiped
their
yellow
beards
in
silence
till
they
rose
to
go
amal
stretching
himself
for
they
were
barbarians
we
be
a
goodly
company
i
wonder
what
the
ravens
and
the
dogfish
will
make
of
some
of
us
before
this
snow
melts
rather
what
theodosius
may
send
i
answered
and
though
they
laughed
i
saw
that
my
chance
shot
troubled
them
old
allo
lingered
behind
a
little
see
he
said
winking
and
blinking
i
am
no
more
than
their
dog
when
i
have
shown
their
men
the
secret
short
ways
across
our
bogs
they
will
kick
me
like
one
i
should
not
be
in
haste
to
show
them
those
ways
said
pertinax
till
i
was
sure
that
rome
could
not
save
the
wall
think
so
woe
is
me
said
the
old
man
i
only
wanted
peace
for
my
people
and
he
went
out
stumbling
through
the
snow
behind
the
tall
winged
hats
this
fashion
then
slowly
a
day
at
a
time
which
is
very
bad
for
doubting
troops
the
war
came
upon
us
at
first
the
winged
hats
swept
in
from
the
sea
as
they
had
done
before
and
there
we
met
them
as
before
with
the
catapults
and
they
sickened
of
it
yet
for
a
long
time
they
would
not
trust
their
on
land
and
i
think
when
it
came
to
revealing
the
secrets
of
the
tribe
the
little
picts
were
afraid
or
ashamed
to
show
them
all
the
roads
across
the
heather
i
had
this
from
a
pict
prisoner
they
were
as
much
our
spies
as
our
enemies
for
the
winged
hats
oppressed
them
and
took
their
winter
stores
ah
foolish
little
people
the
winged
hats
began
to
roll
us
up
from
each
end
of
the
wall
i
sent
runners
southward
to
see
what
the
news
might
be
in
britain
but
the
wolves
were
very
bold
that
winter
among
the
deserted
stations
where
the
troops
had
once
been
and
none
came
back
we
had
trouble
too
with
the
forage
for
the
ponies
along
the
wall
i
kept
ten
and
so
did
pertinax
we
lived
and
slept
in
the
saddle
riding
east
or
west
and
we
ate
our
ponies
the
people
of
the
town
also
made
us
some
trouble
till
i
gathered
them
all
in
one
quarter
behind
hunno
we
broke
down
the
wall
on
either
side
of
it
to
make
as
it
were
a
citadel
our
men
fought
better
in
close
order
the
end
of
the
second
month
we
were
deep
in
the
war
as
a
man
is
deep
in
a
snowdrift
or
in
a
dream
i
think
we
fought
in
our
sleep
at
least
i
know
i
have
gone
on
the
wall
and
come
off
again
remembering
nothing
between
though
my
throat
was
harsh
with
giving
orders
and
my
sword
i
could
see
had
been
used
winged
hats
fought
like
wolves
all
in
a
pack
where
they
had
suffered
most
there
they
charged
in
most
hotly
this
was
hard
for
the
defenders
but
it
held
them
from
sweeping
on
into
britain
those
days
pertinax
and
i
wrote
on
the
plaster
of
the
bricked
archway
into
valentia
the
names
of
the
towers
and
the
days
on
which
they
fell
one
by
one
we
wished
for
some
record
the
fighting
the
fight
was
always
hottest
to
left
and
right
of
the
great
statue
of
roma
dea
near
to
rutilianus
house
by
the
light
of
the
sun
that
old
fat
man
whom
we
had
not
considered
at
all
grew
young
again
among
the
trumpets
i
remember
he
said
his
sword
was
an
oracle
let
us
consult
the
oracle
he
would
say
and
put
the
handle
against
his
ear
and
shake
his
head
wisely
and
this
day
is
allowed
rutilianus
to
live
he
would
say
and
tucking
up
his
cloak
he
would
puff
and
pant
and
fight
well
oh
there
were
jests
in
plenty
on
the
wall
to
take
the
place
of
food
endured
for
two
months
and
seventeen
days
always
being
pressed
from
three
sides
into
a
smaller
space
several
times
allo
sent
in
word
that
help
was
at
hand
we
did
not
believe
it
but
it
cheered
our
men
end
came
not
with
shootings
of
joy
but
like
the
rest
as
in
a
dream
the
winged
hats
suddenly
left
us
in
peace
for
one
night
and
the
next
day
which
is
too
long
for
spent
men
we
slept
at
first
lightly
expecting
to
be
roused
and
then
like
logs
each
where
he
lay
may
you
never
need
such
sleep
when
i
waked
our
towers
were
full
of
strange
armed
men
who
watched
us
snoring
i
roused
pertinax
and
we
leaped
up
together
said
a
young
man
in
clean
armour
do
you
fight
against
theodosius
look
we
looked
over
the
red
snow
no
winged
hats
were
there
south
we
looked
over
the
white
snow
and
behold
there
were
the
eagles
of
two
strong
legions
encamped
east
and
west
we
saw
flame
and
fighting
but
by
hunno
all
was
still
no
more
said
the
young
man
rome
arm
is
long
where
are
the
captains
of
the
wall
said
we
were
those
men
you
are
old
and
he
cried
maximus
said
that
they
were
boys
that
was
true
some
years
ago
said
pertinax
what
is
our
fate
to
be
you
fine
and
child
am
called
ambrosius
a
secretary
of
the
emperor
he
answered
show
me
a
certain
letter
which
maximus
wrote
from
a
tent
at
aquileia
and
perhaps
i
will
believe
took
it
from
my
breast
and
when
he
had
read
it
he
saluted
us
saying
your
fate
is
in
your
own
hands
if
you
choose
to
serve
theodosius
he
will
give
you
a
legion
if
it
suits
you
to
go
to
your
homes
we
will
give
you
a
triumph
would
like
better
a
bath
wine
food
razors
soaps
oils
and
scents
said
pertinax
laughing
i
see
you
are
a
boy
said
ambrosius
and
you
turning
to
me
bear
no
against
theodosius
but
in
i
began
war
it
is
as
it
is
in
love
said
pertinax
whether
she
be
good
or
bad
one
gives
one
best
once
to
one
only
that
given
there
remains
no
second
worth
giving
or
taking
is
true
said
ambrosius
i
was
with
maximus
before
he
died
he
warned
theodosius
that
you
would
never
serve
him
and
frankly
i
say
i
am
sorry
for
my
emperor
has
rome
to
console
him
said
pertinax
i
ask
you
of
your
kindness
to
let
us
go
to
our
homes
and
get
this
smell
out
of
our
nostrils
the
less
they
gave
us
a
triumph
was
well
earned
said
puck
throwing
some
leaves
into
the
still
water
of
the
marlpit
the
black
oily
circles
spread
dizzily
as
the

whispered

stood
still
for
not
twenty
paces
away
a
magnificent
sat
on
his

we

and
vain
they

rainy
afternoon
drove

una
over
to
play
pirates
in
the
little
mill
if

rats
on
the
rafters
and
oats
in
your

the
with
its
and
inscriptions
on
beams
about
floods
and
sweethearts
is
a
splendid
place
it
is
lighted
by
a
window
called
duck
window
that
looks
across
to
little
lindens
farm
and
the
spot
where
jack
cade
was
killed
when
they
had
climbed
the
attic
ladder
they
called
it
mainmast
tree
out
of
the
ballad
of
sir
andrew
barton
and
dan
it
with
might
and
main
as
the
ballad
says
they
saw
a
man
sitting
on
duck
he
was
dressed
in
a
doublet
and
tight
hose
and
he
drew
busily
in
a
book
ye
sit
ye
puck
cried
from
a
rafter
overhead
what
it
is
to
be
beautiful
sir
harry
dawe
pardon
hal
says
i
am
the
very
image
of
a
head
for
a
gargoyle
the
man
laughed
and
raised
his
dark
velvet
cap
to
the
children
and
his
grizzled
hair
bristled
out
in
a
stormy
fringe
he
was
old
forty
at
least
but
his
eyes
were
young
with
funny
little
wrinkles
all
round
them
a
satchel
of
embroidered
leather
hung
from
his
broad
belt
which
looked
interesting
we
see
said
una
coming
forward
he
said
moving
up
on
the
and
returned
to
his
work
with
a
pencil
puck
sat
as
though
the
grin
were
fixed
for
ever
on
his
broad
face
while
they
watched
the
quick
certain
fingers
that
copied
it
presently
the
man
took
a
reed
pen
from
his
satchel
and
trimmed
it
with
a
little
ivory
knife
carved
in
the
semblance
of
a
fish
what
a
beauty
cried
dan
fingers
that
blade
is
perilous
sharp
i
made
it
myself
of
the
best
low
country
steel
and
so
too
this
fish
when
his
travels
to
his
tail
so
he
swallows
up
the
blade
even
as
the
whale
swallowed
gaffer
jonah
yes
and
that
my
inkhorn
i
made
the
four
silver
saints
round
it
press
barnabas
head
it
opens
and
then
dipped
the
trimmed
pen
and
with
careful
boldness
began
to
put
in
the
essential
lines
of
puck
rugged
face
that
had
been
but
faintly
revealed
by
the
the
children
gasped
for
it
fairly
leaped
from
the
page
as
he
worked
and
the
rain
fell
on
the
tiles
he
talked
now
clearly
now
muttering
now
breaking
off
to
frown
or
smile
at
his
work
he
told
them
he
was
born
at
little
lindens
farm
and
his
father
used
to
beat
him
for
drawing
things
instead
of
doing
things
till
an
old
priest
called
father
roger
who
drew
illuminated
letters
in
rich
books
coaxed
the
parents
to
let
him
take
the
boy
as
a
sort
of
painter
apprentice
then
he
went
with
father
roger
to
oxford
where
he
cleaned
plates
and
carried
cloaks
and
shoes
for
the
scholars
of
a
college
called
merton
you
hate
that
said
dan
after
a
great
many
other
questions
never
thought
o
half
oxford
was
building
new
colleges
or
beautifying
the
old
and
she
had
called
to
her
aid
the
of
all
christendie
kings
in
their
trade
and
honoured
of
kings
i
knew
them
i
worked
for
them
that
was
enough
no
wonder
he
stopped
and
laughed
became
a
great
man
hal
said
puck
said
so
robin
even
bramante
said
so
what
did
you
do
dan
asked
the
artist

at
him
queerly
in
stone
and
such
up
and
down
england
you
would
not
have
heard
of
to
come
nearer
home
i
rebuilded
this
little
st
barnabas
church
of
ours
it
cost
me
more
trouble
and
sorrow
than
aught
i
touched
in
my
life
but
was
a
sound
lesson
said
dan
had
lessons
this
morning
not
afflict
ye
lad
said
hal
while
puck
roared
is
strange
to
think
how
that
little
church
was
rebuilt
and
made
glorious
thanks
to
some
few
godly
sussex
ironmasters
a
bristow
sailor
lad
a
proud
ass
called
hal
o
the
draft
because
see
he
was
always
drawing
and
drafting
and
he
dragged
the
words
slowly
a
scotch
pirate
said
dan
he
wriggled
like
a
hooked
fish
that
andrew
barton
you
were
singing
of
on
the
stair
just
now
he
dipped
again
in
the
inkwell
and
held
his
breath
over
a
sweeping
line
as
though
he
had
forgotten
everything
else
do
build
churches
do
they
said
dan
do
they
help
mightily
hal
laughed
you
were
at
your
lessons
this
morn

upon
of
course
hal
considered
a
moment
pen
in

and
puck
said
some
long
words
that
was
my
case
too
he
cried
you
say
but
certainly
i
did
not
conduct
myself
well
i
was
proud
of
of
such
things
as
porches
a
galilee
porch
at
lincoln
for
choice
proud
of
one
torrigiano
arm
on
my
shoulder
proud
of
my
knighthood

staring
at

where
the
hops

and
they
twine
the
wrong

at

your
magnificence
he
said
drafted
two
good
new
things
today
and
he
doffed
his
cap
to
the
bubbling
bird
then
they
walked
through
the
grass
to
the
knoll
where
little
lindens
stands
the
old
farmhouse
to
the
ground
took
almost
the
colour
of
a
in
the
afternoon
light
the
pigeons
pecked
at
the
mortar
in
the
the
bees
that
had
lived
under
the
tiles
since
it
was
built
filled
the
hot
august
air
with
their
booming
and
the
smell
of
the
by
the
mixed
with
the
smell
of
earth
after

after
baking
and
a
tickle
of

came
to

shaded
her
brows
against

to
pluck
a
sprig
of
rosemary
and
turned
down
the
orchard
the
old
spaniel
in
his
barrel
barked
once
or
twice
to
show
he
was
in
charge
of
the
empty
house
puck
clicked
back
the
marvel
that
i
love
it
said
hal
in
a
whisper
can
town
folk
know
of
the
nature
of
housen
or
land
they
perched
themselves
arow
on
the
old
hacked
oak
bench
in
lindens
garden
looking
across
the
valley
of
the
brook
at
the
dimples
and
hollows
of
the
forge
behind
hobden
cottage
the
old
man
was
cutting
a
faggot
in
his
garden
by
the
hives
it
was
quite
a
second
after
his
chopper
fell
that
the
chump
of
the
blow
reached
their
lazy
ears
yeh
said
hal
mind
when
where
that
old
gaffer
stands
was
nether
forge
master
john
collins
foundry
many
a
night
has
his
big
shook
me
in
my
bed
here
if
the
wind
was
east
i
could
hear
master
tom
collins
forge
at
stockens
answering
his
brother
and
midway
between
sir
john
pelham
sledgehammers
at
brightling
would
strike
in
like
a
pack
o
scholars
and
they
say
till
i
fell
asleep
yes
the
valley
was
as
full
o
forges
and
fineries
as
a
may
shaw
o
cuckoos
all
gone
to
grass
now
did
they
make
said
dan
for
the
king
ships
and
for
others
serpentines
and
cannon
mostly
when
the
guns
were
cast
down
would
come
the
king
officers
and
take
our
to
haul
them
to
the
coast
look
here
one
of
the
first
and
finest
craftsmen
of
the
sea
he
fluttered
back
a
page
of
his
book
and
showed
them
a
young
head
underneath
was
written
came
down
with
a
king
order
on
master
john
collins
for
twenty
serpentines
wicked
little
cannon
they
be
to
furnish
a
venture
of
ships
i
drafted
him
thus
sitting
by
our
fire
telling
mother
of
the
new
lands
he
find
the
far
side
the
world
and
he
found
them
too
there
a
nose
to
cleave
through
unknown
seas
cabot
was
his
name
a
bristol
lad
half
a
foreigner
i
set
a
heap
by
him
he
helped
me
to
my
thought
that
was
sir
andrew
barton
said
dan
but
foundations
before
roofs
hal
answered
first
put
me
in
the
way
of
it
i
had
come
down
here
not
to
serve
god
as
a
craftsman
should
but
to
show
my
people
how
great
a
craftsman
i
was
they
cared
not
and
it
served
me
right
one
split
straw
for
my
craft
or
my
greatness
what
a
murrain
call
had
i
they
said
to
mell
with
old
st
barnabas
ruinous
the
church
had
been
since
the
black
death
and
ruinous
she
would
remain
and
i
could
hang
myself
in
my
new
gentle
and
simple
high
and
low
the
hayes
the
fowles
the
fenners
the
collinses
they
were
all
in
a
tale
against
me
only
sir
john
pelham
up
yonder
at
brightling
bade
me
and
go
on
yet
how
could
i
did
i
ask
master
collins
for
his
to
haul
beams
the
oxen
had
gone
to
lewes
after
lime
did
he
promise
me
a
set
of
iron
cramps
or
ties
for
the
roof
they
never
came
to
hand
or
else
they
were
spaulty
or
cracked
so
with
everything
nothing
said
but
naught
done
except
i
stood
by
them
and
then
done
amiss
i
thought
the
countryside
was
fair
bewitched
was
said
puck
knees
under
chin
you
never
suspect
ary
one
till
sebastian
came
for
his
guns
and
john
collins
played
him
the
same
dog
tricks
as
he
played
me
with
my
ironwork
week
in
week
out
two
of
three
serpentines
would
be
flawed
in
the
casting
and
only
fit
they
said
to
be
then
john
collins
would
shake
his
head
and
vow
he
could
pass
no
cannon
for
the
king
service
that
were
not
perfect
saints
how
sebastian
stormed
i
know
for
we
sat
on
this
bench
sharing
our
sorrows
sebastian
had
fumed
away
six
weeks
at
lindens
and
gotten
just
six
serpentines
dirk
brenzett
master
of
the
cygnet
hoy
sends
me
word
that
the
block
of
stone
he
was
fetching
me
from
france
for
our
new
font
he
hove
overboard
to
lighten
his
ship
chased
by
andrew
barton
up
to
rye
port
the
pirate
said
dan
and
while
i
am
tearing
my
hair
over
this
ticehurst
will
my
best
mason
comes
to
me
shaking
and
vowing
that
the
devil
horned
tailed
and
chained
has
run
out
on
him
from
the
and
the
men
would
work
there
no
more
so
i
took
off
the
foundations
which
we
were
strengthening
and
went
into
the
bell
tavern
for
a
cup
of
ale
says
master
john
collins
have
it
your
own
way
lad
but
if
i
was
you
i
take
the
sinnification
o
the
sign
and
leave
old
barnabas
church
alone
and
they
all
wagged
their
sinful
heads
and
agreed
less
afraid
of
the
devil
than
of
me
as
i
saw
later
i
brought
my
sweet
news
to
lindens
sebastian
was
limewashing
the
for
mother
he
loved
her
like
a
son
up
lad
he
says
god
where
he
was
only
you
and
i
chance
to
be
pure
pute
asses
we
been
tricked
hal
and
more
shame
to
me
a
sailor
that
i
did
not
guess
it
before
you
must
leave
your
belfry
alone
forsooth
because
the
devil
is
adrift
there
and
i
can
not
get
my
serpentines
because
john
collins
can
not
cast
them
aright
meantime
andrew
barton
hawks
off
the
port
of
rye
and
why
to
take
those
very
serpentines
which
poor
cabot
must
whistle
for
the
said
serpentines
i
wager
my
share
of
new
continents
being
now
hid
away
in
st
barnabas
clear
as
the
irish
coast
at
noonday
they
sure
never
dare
to
do
it
i
said
and
for
another
thing
selling
cannon
to
the
king
enemies
is
black
treason
hanging
and
fine
is
sure
large
profit
men
dare
any
gallows
for
that
i
have
been
a
trader
myself
says
he
we
must
be
upsides
with
for
the
honour
of
bristol
he
hatched
a
plot
sitting
on
the
limewash
bucket
we
gave
out
to
ride
o
tuesday
to
london
and
made
a
show
of
taking
farewells
of
our
friends
especially
of
master
john
collins
but
at
wadhurst
woods
we
turned
rode
home
to
the
hid
our
horses
in
a
at
the
foot
of
the
glebe
and
come
night
stole
uphill
to
barnabas
church
again
a
thick
mist
and
a
moon
striking
through
had
no
sooner
locked
the
behind
us
than
over
goes
sebastian
full
length
in
the
dark
he
says
step
high
and
feel
low
hal
i
stumbled
over
guns
before
groped
and
one
by
one
the
tower
was
pitchy
dark
i
counted
the
lither
barrels
of
twenty
serpentines
laid
out
on
pease
straw
no
conceal
at
all
two
my
end
says
sebastian
slapping
metal
they
be
for
andrew
barton
lower
deck
honest
honest
john
collins
so
this
is
his
his
arsenal
his
armoury
now
see
you
why
your
pokings
and
pryings
have
raised
the
devil
in
sussex
you
hindered
john
lawful
trade
for
months
and
he
laughed
where
he
lay
tower
is
no
fireside
at
midnight
so
we
climbed
the
belfry
stairs
and
there
sebastian
trips
over
a
with
its
horns
and
tail
your
devil
has
left
his
doublet
does
it
become
me
hal
he
draws
it
on
and
capers
in
the
shafts
of
then
he
sits
on
the
stairs
rapping
with
his
tail
on
a
board
and
his
was
dreader
than
his
front
and
a
howlet
lit
in
and
screeched
at
the
horns
of
him
you
keep
out
the
devil
shut
the
door
he
whispered
and
that
another
false
proverb
hal
for
i
can
hear
your
opening
locked
it
who
has
another
key
then
i
said
the
congregation
to
judge
by
their
feet
he
says
and
peers
into
the
blackness
still
still
hal
hear
grunt
that
more
o
my
serpentines
i
be
bound
one
two
three
four
they
bear
in
faith
andrew
equips
himself
like
an
admiral
serpentines
in
all
if
it
had
been
an
echo
we
heard
john
collins
voice
come
up
all
hollow
serpentines
and
two
that
the
full
tally
for
sir
andrew
barton
costs
naught
whispers
sebastian
shall
i
drop
my
dagger
on
his
head
go
over
to
rye
o
thursday
in
the
hid
under
the
dirk
brenzett
meets
them
at
udimore
as
before
says
john
what
a
worn
handsmooth
trade
it
is
says
sebastian
i
lay
we
are
the
sole
two
babes
in
the
village
that
have
not
our
lawful
share
in
the
venture
was
a
full
score
folk
below
talking
like
all
robertsbridge
market
we
counted
them
by
voice
john
collins
pipes
the
guns
for
the
french
carrack
must
lie
here
next
month
will
when
does
your
young
fool
me
so
please
you
come
back
from
lunnon
odds
i
heard
ticehurst
will
answer
lay
just
where
a
mind
mus
collins
we
all
too
afraid
o
the
devil
to
mell
with
the
tower
now
and
the
long
knave
laughed
is
easy
enow
for
you
to
raise
the
devil
will
says
another
ralph
hobden
of
the
forge
roars
sebastian
and
ere
i
could
hold
him
he
leaps
down
the
stairs
howling
no
bounds
he
had
scarce
time
to
lay
out
for
the
nearest
than
they
ran
saints
how
they
ran
we
heard
them
pound
on
the
door
of
the
bell
tavern
and
then
we
ran
too
next
says
sebastian
looping
up
his
as
he
leaped
the
briars
i
broke
honest
john
face
to
sir
john
pelham
i
said
he
is
the
only
one
that
ever
stood
by
me
rode
to
brightling
and
past
sir
john
lodges
where
the
keepers
would
have
shot
at
us
for
and
we
had
sir
john
down
into
his
justice
chair
and
when
we
had
told
him
our
tale
and
showed
him
the
which
sebastian
wore
still
girt
about
him
he
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
he
says
i
see
justice
done
before
daylight
what
your
complaint
master
collins
is
my
old
friend
none
of
mine
i
cried
when
i
think
how
he
and
his
likes
have
baulked
and
dozened
and
cozened
me
at
every
turn
over
the
church
and
i
choked
at
the
thought
but
ye
see
now
they
needed
it
for
another
use
says
he
smoothly
also
they
did
my
serpentines
sebastian
cries
i
should
be
half
across
the
western
ocean
by
now
if
my
guns
had
been
ready
but
sold
to
a
scotch
pirate
by
your
old
friend
your
proof
says
sir
john
stroking
his
beard
broke
my
shins
over
them
not
an
hour
since
and
i
heard
john
give
order
where
they
were
to
be
taken
says
sebastian
words
only
says
sir
john
master
collins
is
somewhat
of
a
liar
at
best
carried
it
so
gravely
that
for
the
moment
i
thought
he
was
dipped
in
this
secret
traffick
too
and
that
there
was
not
an
honest
ironmaster
in
sussex
o
reason
says
sebastian
and
raps
with
his
on
the
table
whose
guns
are
they
then
manifestly
says
sir
john
you
come
with
the
king
order
for
and
master
collins
casts
them
in
his
foundry
if
he
chooses
to
bring
them
up
from
nether
forge
and
lay
out
in
the
why
they
are
so
much
the
nearer
to
the
main
road
and
you
are
saved
a
day
hauling
what
a
coil
to
make
of
a
mere
act
of
neighbourly
kindness
lad
fear
i
have
requited
him
very
scurvily
says
sebastian
looking
at
his
knuckles
but
what
of
the
i
could
do
with
well
but
they
are
not
in
the
king
order
says
sir
john
questionless
in
his
zeal
for
the
king
and
his
love
for
you
john
adds
those
two
cannon
as
a
gift
is
plain
as
this
coming
daylight
ye
stockfish
it
is
says
sebastian
oh
sir
john
sir
john
why
did
you
never
use
the
sea
you
are
lost
ashore
and
he
looked
on
him
with
great
love
do
my
best
in
my
station
sir
john
strokes
his
beard
again
and
rolls
forth
his
deep
drumming
justice
voice
thus
but
suffer
me
two
lads
on
some
midnight
frolic
into
which
i
probe
not
roystering
around
the
taverns
surprise
master
collins
at
his
he
thinks
a
moment
at
his
good
deeds
done
by
stealth
ye
surprise
him
i
say
cruelly
sir
john
if
you
had
seen
him
run
says
sebastian
this
you
ride
breakneck
to
me
with
a
tale
of
pirates
and
and
which
though
it
hath
moved
my
mirth
as
a
man
offendeth
my
reason
as
a
magistrate
so
i
will
accompany
you
back
to
the
tower
with
perhaps
some
few
of
my
own
people
and
wagons
and
i
be
your
warrant
that
master
john
collins
will
freely
give
you
your
guns
and
your
master
sebastian
he
breaks
into
his
proper
voice
i
warned
the
old
tod
and
his
neighbours
long
ago
that
they
come
to
trouble
with
their
and
but
we
can
not
have
half
sussex
hanged
for
a
little
are
ye
content
lads
commit
any
treason
for
two
said
sebastian
and
rubs
his
hands
ye
have
just
compounded
with
rank
for
the
same
bribe
says
sir
john
wherefore
to
horse
and
get
the
guns
master
collins
meant
the
guns
for
sir
andrew
barton
all
along
did
he
said
dan
that
he
did
said
hal
he
lost
them
we
poured
into
the
village
on
the
red
edge
of
dawn
sir
john
horsed
in
his
pennon
flying
behind
him
thirty
stout
brightling
knaves
five
abreast
behind
them
four
and
behind
them
four
trumpets
to
triumph
over
the
jest
blowing
our
king

and
he
never
winked
an
eyelid
not
even
when
he
saw
the
guns
all
carted
off
to
lewes
then
nor
later
said
puck

after
he
gave
st

land
he
dropped
his
chin
on
his
chest
your
father
at
the
forge
what
he
talking
to
old
hobden
about
said
puck
opening
his

with
three
leaves
in

that
old
oak
lying
across
the
brook
pater
always
wants
it
grubbed
in
the
still
valley
they
could
hear

hobden
deep
tones
it
as

vivers
of

little
bubbling
chuckle

in
that
belfry
said
hal

a
lazy
laugh

be
a
hobden
by
his
voice
the
oak
is
the
regular
bridge
for

and
the
next
moment
their
father

calling
across

just
at
dusk
a
soft
september
rain
began
to
fall
on
the
the
mothers
wheeled
the
bouncing
perambulators
out
of
the
gardens
bins
were
put
away
and
made
up
the
young
couples
strolled
home
two
to
each
umbrella
and
the
single
men
walked
behind
them
laughing
dan
and
una
who
had
been
picking
after
their
lessons
marched
off
to
roast
potatoes
at
the
where
old
hobden
with
bess
his
lurcher
dog
lived
all
the
month
through
drying
the
hops
they
settled
themselves
as
usual
on
the
cot
in
front
of
the
fires
and
when
hobden
drew
up
the
shutter
stared
as
usual
at
the
flameless
bed
of
coals
spouting
its
heat
up
the
dark
well
of
the
roundel
slowly
he
cracked
off
a
few
fresh
pieces
of
coal
packed
them
with
fingers
that
never
flinched
exactly
where
they
would
do
most
good
slowly
he
reached
behind
him
till
dan
tilted
the
potatoes
into
his
iron
scoop
of
a
hand
carefully
he
arranged
them
round
the
fire
and
then
stood
for
a
moment
black
against
the
glare
as
he
closed
the
shutter
the
seemed
dark
before
the
end
and
he
lit
the
candle
in
the
lanthorn
the
children
liked
all
these
things
because
they
knew
them
so
well
the
bee
boy
hobden
son
who
is
not
quite
right
in
his
head
though
he
can
do
anything
with
bees
slipped
in
like
a
shadow
they
only
guessed
it
when
bess
wagged
against
them
a
big
voice
began
singing
outside
in
the
drizzle

brickwork
of
the
roundel
and
swung

arms
abroad

all
he
said
and
they
stumped
upstairs
laughing
the
children
heard
their
shovels
rasp
on
the
cloth
where
the
yellow
hops
lie
drying
above
the
fires
and
all

filled
with
the

if

of
him
what
are
you
laughin

he
cleaved
middlin
close
to
people
like
no
more
he
never
meant
to
go
out
of
old
england
not
he
so
he
was
sent
messagin
for
help
among
flesh
an
blood
but
flesh
an
blood
must
always
think
of
their
own
concerns
an
robin
could
get
through
at
ye
see
they
thought
it
was
off
the
marsh
did
you
what
did
the
fai
pharisees
want
una
asked
boat
to
be
sure
their
liddle
wings
could
no
more
cross
channel
than
so
many
tired
butterflies
a
boat
an
a
crew
they
desired
to
sail
over
to
france
where
yet
awhile
folks
had
tore
down
the
images
they
could
abide
cruel
canterbury
bells
ringin
to
bulverhithe
for
more
pore
men
an
women
to
be
burnded
nor
the
king
proud
messenger
ridin
through
the
land
givin
orders
to
tear
down
the
images
they
could
abide
it
no
shape
nor
yet
they
could
get
their
boat
crew
to
flit
by
without
leave
an
from
flesh
an
blood
flesh
an
blood
came
an
went
about
its
own
business
the
while
the
marsh
was
swarvin
up
an
swarvin
up
with
pharisees
from
all
england
over
strivin
all
means
to
get
through
at
flesh
an
blood
to
tell
their
sore
need
i
do
know
as
you
ever
heard
say
pharisees
are
like
chickens
woman
used
to
say
that
too
hobden
folding
his
brown
arms
be
you
run
too
many
chickens
together
an
the
ground
sickens
like
an
you
get
a
squat
an
your
chickens
die
same
way
you
crowd
pharisees
all
in
one
place
they
do
die
but
flesh
an
blood
among
is
apt
to
sick
up
an
pine
off
they
do
mean
it
flesh
an
blood
do
know
it
but
that
the
truth
as
i
heard
the
pharisees
through
bein
all
stenched
up
an
frighted
an
to
come
through
with
their
supplications
they
changed
the
thin
airs
an
humours
in
flesh
an
blood
it
lay
on
the
marsh
like
thunder
men
saw
their
churches
ablaze
with
the
wildfire
in
the
windows
after
dark
they
saw
their
cattle
scatterin
an
no
man
scarin
their
sheep
flockin
an
no
man
drivin
their
horses
latherin
an
no
man
leadin
they
saw
the
liddle
low
green
lights
more
than
ever
in
the
they
heard
the
liddle
feet
patterin
more
than
ever
round
the
houses
an
night
an
day
day
an
night
was
all
as
though
they
were
bein
creeped
up
on
an
hinted
at
by
some
one
or
other
that
could
rightly
shape
their
trouble
oh
i
lay
they
sweated
man
an
maid
woman
an
child
their
nature
done
no
service
all
the
weeks
while
the
marsh
was
swarvin
up
with
pharisees
but
they
was
flesh
an
blood
an
marsh
men
before
all
they
reckoned
the
signs
sinnified
trouble
for
the
marsh
or
that
the
sea
rear
up
against
dymchurch
wall
an
they
be
drownded
like
old
winchelsea
or
that
the
plague
was
comin
so
they
looked
for
the
meanin
in
the
sea
or
in
the
clouds
far
an
high
up
they
never
thought
to
look
near
where
they
could
see
naught
there
was
a
poor
widow
at
dymchurch
under
the
wall
which
lacking
man
or
property
she
had
the
more
time
for
feeling
and
she
come
to
feel
there
was
a
trouble
outside
her
doorstep
bigger
an
heavier
than
aught
she
ever
carried
over
it
she
had
two
sons
one
born
blind
an
struck
dumb
through
fallin
off
the
wall
when
he
was
liddle
they
was
men
grown
but
not
an
she
worked
for
keepin
bees
and
answerin
questions
sort
of
questions
said
dan
where
lost
things
might
be
found
an
what
to
put
about
a
crooked
baby
neck
an
how
to
join
parted
sweethearts
she
felt
the
trouble
on
the
marsh
same
as
eels
feel
thunder
she
was
a
wise
woman
woman
was
too
said
hobden
seen
her
brish
sparks
like
off
an
anvil
out
of
her
hair
in
thunderstorms
but
she
never
laid
out
to
answer
questions
woman
was
a
seeker
like
an
seekers
they
sometimes
find
one
night
while
she
lay
abed
hot
an
achin
there
come
a
dream
tapped
at
her
window
an
widow
whitgift
it
said
widow
whitgift
by
the
wings
an
the
whistlin
she
thought
it
was
peewits
but
last
she
arose
an
dressed
herself
an
opened
her
door
to
the
marsh
an
she
felt
the
trouble
an
the
groanin
all
about
her
strong
as
fever
an
ague
an
she
calls
what
is
it
oh
what
is
it
was
all
like
the
frogs
in
the
diks
peepin
then
was
all
like
the
reeds
in
the
diks
an
then
the
great
rummelled
along
the
wall
an
she
could
hear
proper
times
she
called
an
three
times
the
did
her
down
but
she
catched
the
quiet
between
an
she
cries
out
what
is
the
trouble
on
the
marsh
that
been
lying
down
with
my
heart
an
arising
with
my
body
this
month
gone
she
felt
a
liddle
hand
lay
hold
on
her
an
she
stooped
to
the
pull
o
that
liddle
hand
tom
shoesmith
spread
his
huge
fist
before
the
fire
and
smiled
at
it
as
he
went
on
the
sea
drown
the
marsh
she
says
she
was
a
marsh
woman
first
an
foremost
says
the
liddle
voice
sleep
sound
for
all
o
that
the
plague
comin
to
the
marsh
she
says
them
was
all
the
ills
she
knowed
sleep
sound
for
all
o
that
says
robin
turned
about
half
mindful
to
go
in
but
the
liddle
voices
grieved
that
shrill
an
sorrowful
she
turns
back
an
she
cries
if
it
is
not
a
trouble
of
flesh
an
blood
what
can
i
do
pharisees
cried
out
upon
her
from
all
round
to
fetch
them
a
boat
to
sail
to
france

back
no
more
a
boat
on
the
wall
she
says
but
i
ca

it
down
to
the
sea
nor

in
the
big
sea

voices
just
about
pierced
through
her
an
there
was
children

stood
out
all
she
could
but
she
could
rightly
stand
against
that
so
she
says

my
sons
for
your
job
i
not
hinder
you
ca
ask
no
more
of
a
mother
saw
them
liddle
green
lights

an
cross
till
she
was
dizzy
she
heard
them
liddle
feet
patterin
by
the
thousand
she
heard
cruel
canterbury
bells
ringing
to
bulverhithe
an
she
heard
the
great
ranging
along
the
wall
that
was
while
the
pharisees
was
workin
a
dream
to
wake
her
two
sons
asleep
an
while
she
bit
on
her
fingers
she
saw
them
two
she
bore
come
out
an
pass
her
with
never
a
word
she
followed
cryin
pitiful
to
the
old
boat
on
the
wall
an
that
they
took
an
runned
down
to
the
sea
they
stepped

and
half
shut
his

he
said

a
fine
valiant
woman
the
widow
whitgift
she
stood
twistin
the
eends
of
her
long
hair
over
her
fingers
an
she
shook
like
a
poplar
makin
up
her
mind
the
pharisees
all
about
they
hushed
their
children
from
cryin
an
they
waited
she
was
all
their
dependence
her
leave
an
they
could
not
pass
for
she
was
the
mother
so
she
shook
like
a
makin
up
her
mind
she
drives
the
word
past
her
teeth
an
go
she
says
go
with
my
leave
an
goodwill
i
saw
then
they
say
she
had
to
brace
back
same
as
if
she
was
wadin
in
for
the
pharisees
just
about
flowed
past
her
down
the
beach
to
the
boat
i
dunnamany
of
with
their

an
childern
an
valooables
all
escapin
out
of
cruel
old
england

you
could
hear
chinkin
an
liddle
bundles
hove
down
dunt
on

an
passels
o
liddle
swords
an
shields
raklin
an
liddle
fingers
an
toes
scratchin
on
the
boatside
to
board
her
when
the
two
sons
pushed
her
off
that
boat
she
sunk
lower
an
lower
but
all
the
widow
could
see
in
it
was
her
boys
movin
to
get
at
the
tackle
up
sail
they
did
an
away
they
went
deep
as
a
rye
barge
away
into
the
mists
an
the
widow
whitgift
she
sat
down
an
eased
her
grief
till
mornin
light
never
heard
she
was
all
alone
said
hobden
remember
now
the
one
called
robin
he
stayed
with
her
they
tell
she
was
all
too
grieevious
to
listen
to
his
promises
she
should
ha
made
her
bargain
beforehand
i
allus
told
my
woman
so
cried
she
loaned
her
sons
for
a
pure
bein
as
she
sensed
the
trouble
on
the
marshes
an
was
simple
to
ease
it
tom
laughed
softly
done
that
yes
she
done
that
from
hithe
to
bulverhithe
fretty
man
an
maid
ailin
woman
an
wailin
child
they
took
the
advantage
of
the
change
in
the
thin
airs
just
about
as
soon
as
the
pharisees
flitted
folks
come
out
fresh
an
shinin
all
over
the
marsh
like
snails
after
wet
an
that
while
the
widow
whitgift
sat
grievin
on
the
wall
she
might
have
belieft
us
she
might
have
trusted
her

fussed
no

when

i
reckon
you
keep
my
soul
for
me
the
treasure
and
the
law
song
of
the
fifth
river
when
first
by
eden
tree
the
four
great
rivers
ran
to
each
was
appointed
a
man
her
prince
and
ruler
to
be
but
after
this
was
ordained
the
ancient
legends
tell
there
came
dark
israel
for
whom
no
river
remained
then
he
that
is
wholly
just
said
to
him
on
the
ground
a
handful
of
yellow
dust
and
a
fifth
great
river
shall
run
mightier
than
these
four
in
secret
the
earth
around
and
her
secret
evermore
shall
be
shown
to
thee
and
thy
race
so
it
was
said
and
done
and
deep
in
the
veins
of
earth
and
fed
by
a
thousand
springs
that
comfort
the
or
sap
the
power
of
kings
the
fifth
great
river
had
birth
even
as
it
was
foretold
the
secret
river
of
gold
and
israel
laid
down
his
sceptre
and
his
crown
to
brood
on
that
river
bank
where
the
waters
flashed
and
sank
and
burrowed
in
earth
and
fell
and
bided
a
season
below
for
reason
that
none
might
know
save
only
israel
he
is
lord
of
the
last
the
fifth
most
wonderful
flood
he
hears
her
thunder
past
and
her
song
is
in
his
blood
he
can
foresay
will
fall
for
he
knows
which
fountain
dries
behind
which
a
thousand
leagues
to
the
south
he
can
foresay
will
rise
he
knows
what
far
snows
melt
along
what
a
thousand
leagues
to
the
north
he
snuffs
the
coming
drouth
as
he
snuffs
the
coming
rain
he
knows
what
each
will
bring
forth
and
turns
it
to
his
gain
a
prince
without
a
sword
a
ruler
without
a
throne
israel
follows
his
quest
in
every
land
a
guest
of
many
lands
a
lord
in
no
land
king
is
he
but
the
fifth
great
river
keeps
the
secret
of
her
deeps
for
israel
alone
as
it
was
ordered
to
be
now
it
was
the
third
week
in
november
and
the
woods
rang
with
the
noise
of
no
one
hunted
that
steep
cramped
country
except
the
village
beagles
who
as
often
as
not
escaped
from
their
kennels
and
made
a
day
of
their
own
dan
and
una
found
a
couple
of
them
towling
round
the
after
the
laundry
cat
the
little
brutes
were
only
too
pleased
to
go
rabbiting
so
the
children
ran
them
all
along
the
brook
pastures
and
into
little
lindens
where
the
old
sow
vanquished
them
and
up
to
the
where
they
started
a
fox
he
headed
for
far
wood
and
there
they
frightened
out
all
the
pheasants
who
were
sheltering
from
a
big
beat
across
the
valley
then
the
cruel
guns
began
again
and
they
grabbed
the
beagles
lest
they
should
stray
and
get
hurt
would
be
a
pheasant
in
november
for
a
lot
dan
panted
as
he
caught
folly
by
the
neck
did
you
laugh
that
horrid
way
did
said
una
sitting
on
flora
the
fat
look
the
silly
birds
are
going
back
to
their
own
woods
instead
of
ours
where
they
would
be
safe
till
it
pleased
you
to
kill
them
an
old
man
so
tall
he
was
almost
a
giant
stepped
from
behind
the
clump
of
hollies
by
volaterrae
the
children
jumped
and
the
dogs
dropped
like
setters
he
wore
a
sweeping
gown
of
dark
thick
stuff
lined
and
edged
with
yellowish
fur
and
he
bowed
a
bow
that
made
them
feel
both
proud
and
ashamed
then
he
looked
at
them
steadily
and
they
stared
back
without
doubt
or
fear
are
not
afraid
he
said
running
his
hands
through
his
splendid
grey
beard
afraid
that
those
men
yonder
he
jerked
his
head
towards
the
incessant
of
the
guns
from
the
lower
woods
do
you
hurt
dan
liked
to
be
accurate
especially
when
he
was
shy
hobd
a
friend
of
mine
told
me
that
one
of
the
beaters
got
peppered
last
week
hit
in
the
leg
i
mean
you
see
mr
meyer
will
fire
at
rabbits
but
he
gave
waxy
garnett
a
quid
sovereign
i
mean
and
waxy
told
hobden
he
have
stood
both
barrels
for
half
the
money
does
understand
cried
watching
the
pale
troubled
face
i
wish
she
had
scarcely
said
it
when
puck
rustled
out
of
the
hollies
and
spoke
to
the
man
quickly
in
foreign
words
puck
wore
a
long
cloak
too
the
afternoon
was
just
frosting
down
and
it
changed
his
appearance
altogether
nay
said
at
last
did
not
understand
the
boy
a
freeman
was
a
little
hurt
by
pure
mischance
at
the
hunting
know
that
mischance
what
did
his
lord
do
laugh
and
ride
over
him
the
old
man
sneered
was
one
of
your
own
people
did
the
hurt
kadmiel
puck
eyes
twinkled
maliciously
he
gave
the
freeman
a
piece
of
gold
and
no
more
was
said
jew
drew
blood
from
a
christian
and
no
more
was
said
kadmiel
cried
when
did
they
torture
him
man
may
be
bound
or
fined
or
slain
till
he
has
been
judged
by
his
peers
puck
insisted
is
but
one
law
in
old
england
for
jew
or
christian
the
law
that
was
signed
at
runnymede
that
magna
charta
dan
whispered
it
was
one
of
the
few
history
dates
that
he
could
remember
kadmiel
turned
on
him
with
a
sweep
and
a
whirr
of
his
gown
thou
know
of
that
babe
he
cried
and
lifted
his
hands
in
wonder
said
dan
firmly
charta
was
signed
by
john
that
henry
the
third
put
his
heel
upon
and
old
hobden
says
that
if
it
had
been
for
her
he
calls
everything
her
you
know
the
keepers
would
have
him
clapped
in
lewes
jail
all
the
year
round
again
puck
translated
to
kadmiel
in
the
strange
language
and
at
last
kadmiel
laughed
of
the
mouths
of
babes
do
we
learn
said
he
tell
me
now
and
i
will
not
call
you
a
babe
but
a
rabbi
why
did
the
king
sign
the
roll
of
the
new
law
at
runnymede
for
he
was
a
king
dan
looked
sideways
at
his
sister
it
was
her
turn
he
jolly
well
had
to
said
una
softly
barons
made
him
kadmiel
answered
shaking
his
head
christians
always
forget
that
gold
does
more
than
the
sword
our
good
king
signed
because
he
could
not
borrow
more
money
from
us
bad
jews
he
curved
his
shoulders
as
he
spoke
king
without
gold
is
a
snake
with
a
broken
back
and
his
nose
sneered
up
and
his
eyebrows
frowned
down
is
a
good
deed
to
break
a
snake
back
that
was
my
work
he
cried
triumphantly
to
puck
of
earth
bear
witness
that
that
was
my
work
he
shot
up
to
his
full
towering
height
and
his
words
rang
like
a
trumpet
he
had
a
voice
that
changed
its
tone
almost
as
an
opal
changes
colour
sometimes
deep
and
thundery
sometimes
thin
and
waily
but
always
it
made
you
listen
people
can
bear
witness
to
that
puck
answered
these
babes
how
it
was
done
remember
master
they
do
not
know
doubt
or
fear
i
saw
in
their
faces
when
we
met
said
kadmiel
surely
surely
they
are
taught
to
spit
upon
jews
they
said
dan
much
interested
at
puck
fell
back
a
pace
laughing
is
thinking
of
king
reign
he
explained
people
were
badly
treated
then
we
know
that
they
answered
and
it
was
very
rude
of
them
but
they
could
not
help
it
they
stared
straight
at
kadmiel
mouth
to
see
if
his
teeth
were
all
there
it
stuck
in
their
that
king
john
used
to
pull
out
jews
teeth
to
make
them
lend
him
money
kadmiel
understood
the
look
and
smiled
bitterly
your
king
never
drew
my
teeth
i
think
perhaps
i
drew
his
listen
i
was
not
born
among
christians
but
among
moors
in
spain
in
a
little
white
town
under
the
mountains
yes
the
moors
are
cruel
but
at
least
their
learned
men
dare
to
think
it
was
prophesied
of
me
at
my
birth
that
i
should
be
a
lawgiver
to
a
people
of
a
strange
speech
and
a
hard
language
we
jews
are
always
looking
for
the
prince
and
the
lawgiver
to
come
why
not
my
people
in
the
town
we
were
very
few
set
me
apart
as
a
child
of
the
prophecy
the
chosen
of
the
chosen
we
jews
dream
so
many
dreams
you
would
never
guess
it
to
see
us
slink
about
the
in
our
quarter
but
at
the
day
end
doors
shut
candles
lit
aha
then
we
became
the
chosen
again
he
paced
back
and
forth
through
the
wood
as
he
talked
the
rattle
of
the
never
ceased
and
the
dogs
whimpered
a
little
and
lay
flat
on
the
leaves
was
a
prince
yes
think
of
a
little
prince
who
had
never
known
rough
words
in
his
own
house
handed
over
to
shouting
bearded
rabbis
who
pulled
his
ears
and
filliped
his
nose
all
that
he
might
learn
learn
learn
to
be
king
when
his
time
came
he
such
a
little
prince
it
was
one
eye
he
kept
on
the
moorish
boys
and
the
other
it
roved
about
the
streets
looking
for
his
kingdom
yes
and
he
learned
to
cry
softly
when
he
was
hunted
up
and
down
those
streets
he
learned
to
do
all
things
without
noise
he
played
beneath
his
father
table
when
the
great
candle
was
lit
and
he
listened
as
children
listen
to
the
talk
of
his
friends
above
the
table
they
came
across
the
mountains
from
out
of
all
the
world
for
my
prince
father
was
their
counsellor
they
came
from
behind
the
armies
of
from
rome
from
venice
from
england
they
stole
down
our
alley
they
tapped
secretly
at
our
door
they
took
off
their
rags
they
arrayed
themselves
and
they
talked
to
my
father
at
the
wine
all
over
the
world
the
heathen
fought
each
other
they
brought
news
of
these
wars
and
while
he
played
beneath
the
table
my
prince
heard
these
meanly
dressed
ones
decide
between
themselves
how
and
when
and
for
how
long
king
should
draw
sword
against
king
and
people
rise
up
against
people
why
not
there
can
be
no
war
without
gold
and
we
jews
know
how
the
earth
gold
moves
with
the
seasons
and
the
crops
and
the
winds
circling
and
looping
and
rising
and
sinking
away
like
a
river
a
wonderful
underground
river
how
should
the
foolish
kings
know
that
while
they
fight
and
steal
and
kill
the
children
faces
showed
that
they
knew
nothing
at
all
as
with
open
eyes
they
trotted
and
turned
beside
the
old
man
he
twitched
his
gown
over
his
shoulders
and
a
square
plate
of
gold
studded
with
jewels
gleamed
for
an
instant
through
the
fur
like
a
star
through
flying
snow
matter
he
said
credit
me
my
prince
saw
peace
or
war
decided
not
once
but
many
times
by
the
fall
of
a
coin
spun
between
a
jew
from
bury
and
a
jewess
from
alexandria
in
his
father
house
when
the
great
candle
was
lit
such
power
had
we
jews
among
the
gentiles
ah
my
little
prince
do
you
wonder
that
he
learned
quickly
why
not
he
muttered
to
himself
and
went
on
trade
was
that
of
a
physician
when
i
had
learned
it
in
spain
i
went
to
the
east
to
find
my
kingdom
why
not
a
jew
is
as
free
as
a
sparrow
or
a
dog
he
goes
where
he
is
hunted
in
the
east
i
found
libraries
where
men
dared
to
think
schools
of
medicine
where
they
dared
to
learn
i
was
diligent
in
my
business
therefore
i
stood
before
kings
i
have
been
a
brother
to
princes
and
a
companion
to
beggars
and
i
have
walked
between
the
living
and
the
dead
there
was
no
profit
in
it
i
did
not
find
my
kingdom
so
in
the
tenth
year
of
my
travels
when
i
had
reached
the
uttermost
eastern
sea
i
returned
to
my
father
house
god
had
wonderfully
preserved
my
people
none
had
been
slain
none
even
wounded
and
only
a
few
scourged
i
became
once
more
a
son
in
my
father
house
again
the
great
candle
was
lit
again
the
meanly
apparelled
ones
tapped
on
our
door
after
dusk
and
again
i
heard
them
weigh
out
peace
and
war
as
they
weighed
out
the
gold
on
the
table
but
i
was
not
rich
not
very
rich
therefore
when
those
that
had
power
and
knowledge
and
wealth
talked
together
i
sat
in
the
shadow
why
not
all
my
wanderings
had
shown
me
one
sure
thing
which
is
that
a
king
without
money
is
like
a
spear
without
a
head
he
can
not
do
much
harm
i
said
therefore
to
elias
of
bury
a
great
one
among
our
people
why
do
our
people
lend
any
more
to
the
kings
that
oppress
us
because
said
elias
if
we
refuse
they
stir
up
their
people
against
us
and
the
people
are
tenfold
more
cruel
than
kings
if
thou
doubtest
come
with
me
to
bury
in
england
and
live
as
i
live
saw
my
mother
face
across
the
candle
flame
and
i
said
i
will
come
with
thee
to
bury
maybe
my
kingdom
shall
be
there
i
sailed
with
elias
to
the
darkness
and
the
cruelty
of
bury
in
england
where
there
are
no
learned
men
how
can
a
man
be
wise
if
he
hate
at
bury
i
kept
his
accounts
for
elias
and
i
saw
men
kill
jews
there
by
the
tower
no
none
laid
hands
on
elias
he
lent
money
to
the
king
and
the
king
favour
was
about
him
a
king
will
not
take
the
life
so
long
as
there
is
any
gold
this
king
yes
john
oppressed
his
people
bitterly
because
they
would
not
give
him
money
yet
his
land
was
a
good
land
if
he
had
only
given
it
rest
he
might
have
cropped
it
as
a
christian
crops
his
beard
but
even
that
little
he
did
not
know
for
god
had
deprived
him
of
all
understanding
and
had
multiplied
pestilence
and
famine
and
despair
upon
the
people
therefore
his
people
turned
against
us
jews
who
are
all
people
dogs
why
not
lastly
the
barons
and
the
people
rose
together
against
the
king
because
of
his
cruelties
nay
nay
the
barons
did
not
love
the
people
but
they
saw
that
if
the
king
cut
up
and
destroyed
the
common
people
he
would
presently
destroy
the
barons
they
joined
then
as
cats
and
pigs
will
join
to
slay
a
snake
i
kept
the
accounts
and
i
watched
all
these
things
for
i
remembered
the
prophecy
great
gathering
of
barons
to
most
of
whom
we
had
lent
money
came
to
bury
and
there
after
much
talk
and
a
thousand
they
made
a
roll
of
the
new
laws
that
they
would
force
on
the
king
if
he
swore
to
keep
those
laws
they
would
allow
him
a
little
money
that
was
the
king
god
money
to
waste
they
showed
us
the
roll
of
the
new
laws
why
not
we
had
lent
them
money
we
knew
all
their
counsels
we
jews
shivering
behind
our
doors
in
bury
he
threw
out
his
hands
suddenly
did
not
seek
to
be
paid
all
in
money
we
sought
power
power
power
that
is
our
god
in
our
captivity
power
to
use
said
to
elias
these
new
laws
are
good
lend
no
more
money
to
the
king
so
long
as
he
has
money
he
will
lie
and
slay
the
people
said
elias
i
know
this
people
they
are
madly
cruel
better
one
king
than
a
thousand
butchers
i
have
lent
a
little
money
to
the
barons
or
they
would
torture
us
but
my
most
i
will
lend
to
the
king
he
hath
promised
me
a
place
near
him
at
court
where
my
wife
and
i
shall
be
safe
if
the
king
be
made
to
keep
these
new
laws
i
said
the
land
will
have
peace
and
our
trade
will
grow
if
we
lend
he
will
fight
again
made
thee
a
lawgiver
in
england
said
elias
i
know
this
people
let
the
dogs
tear
one
another
i
will
lend
the
king
ten
thousand
pieces
of
gold
and
he
can
fight
the
barons
at
his
pleasure
are
not
two
thousand
pieces
of
gold
in
all
england
this
summer
i
said
for
i
kept
the
accounts
and
i
knew
how
the
gold
moved
that
wonderful
underground
river
elias
barred
home
the
windows
and
his
hands
about
his
mouth
he
told
me
how
when
he
was
trading
with
small
wares
in
a
french
ship
he
had
come
to
the
castle
of
pevensey
said
dan
again
and
looked
at
una
who
nodded
and
skipped
after
they
had
scattered
his
pack
up
and
down
the
great
hall
some
young
knights
carried
him
to
an
upper
room
and
dropped
him
into
a
well
in
a
wall
that
rose
and
fell
with
the
tide
they
called
him
joseph
and
threw
torches
at
his
wet
head
why
not
of
course
dan
you
know
it
was
puck
held
up
his
hand
to
stop
him
and
kadmiel
who
never
noticed
went
on
the
tide
dropped
he
thought
he
stood
on
old
armour
but
feeling
with
his
toes
he
raked
up
bar
on
bar
of
soft
gold
some
wicked
treasure
of
the
old
days
put
away
and
the
secret
cut
off
by
the
sword
i
have
heard
the
like
before
have
we
una
whispered
it
was
wicked
a
bit
took
a
little
of
the
stuff
with
him
and
thrice
yearly
he
would
return
to
pevensey
as
a
chapman
selling
at
no
price
or
profit
till
they
suffered
him
to
sleep
in
the
empty
room
where
he
would
plumb
and
grope
and
steal
away
a
few
bars
the
great
store
of
it
still
remained
and
by
long
brooding
he
had
come
to
look
on
it
as
his
own
yet
when
we
thought
how
we
should
lift
and
convey
it
we
saw
no
way
this
was
before
the
word
of
the
lord
had
come
to
me
a
walled
fortress
possessed
by
normans
in
the
midst
a
out
of
which
to
remove
secretly
many
of
gold
hopeless
so
elias
wept
adah
his
wife
wept
too
she
had
hoped
to
stand
beside
the
christian
at
court
when
the
king
should
give
them
that
place
at
court
which
he
had
promised
why
not
she
was
born
in
england
an
odious
woman
present
evil
to
us
was
that
elias
out
of
his
strong
folly
had
as
it
were
promised
the
king
that
he
would
arm
him
with
more
gold
wherefore
the
king
in
his
camp
stopped
his
ears
against
the
barons
and
the
people
wherefore
men
died
daily
adah
so
desired
her
place
at
court
she
besought
elias
to
tell
the
king
where
the
treasure
lay
that
the
king
might
take
it
by
force
and
they
would
trust
in
his
gratitude
why
not
this
elias
refused
to
do
for
he
looked
on
the
gold
as
his
own
they
quarrelled
and
they
wept
at
the
evening
meal
and
late
in
the
night
came
one
langton
a
priest
almost
learned
to
borrow
more
money
for
the
barons
elias
and
adah
went
to
their
chamber
kadmiel
laughed
scornfully
in
his
beard
the
shots
across
the
valley
stopped
as
the
shooting
party
changed
their
ground
for
the
last
beat
it
was
i
not
elias
he
went
on
quietly
made
terms
with
langton
touching
the
fortieth
of
the
new
laws
terms
said
puck
quickly
fortieth
of
the
great
charter
says
to
none
will
we
sell
refuse
or
delay
right
or
justice
but
the
barons
had
written
first
to
no
free
man
it
cost
me
two
hundred
broad
pieces
of
gold
to
change
those
narrow
words
langton
the
priest
understood
jew
though
thou
art
said
he
the
change
is
just
and
if
ever
christian
and
jew
came
to
be
equal
in
england
thy
people
may
thank
thee
then
he
went
out
stealthily
as
men
do
who
deal
with
israel
by
night
i
think
he
spent
my
gift
upon
his
altar
why
not
i
have
spoken
with
langton
he
was
such
a
man
as
i
might
have
been
if
if
we
jews
had
been
a
people
but
yet
in
many
things
a
child
heard
elias
and
adah
abovestairs
quarrel
and
knowing
the
woman
was
the
stronger
i
saw
that
elias
would
tell
the
king
of
the
gold
and
that
the
king
would
continue
in
his
stubbornness
therefore
i
saw
that
the
gold
must
be
put
away
from
the
reach
of
any
man
of
a
sudden
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
me
saying
the
morning
is
come
o
thou
that
dwellest
in
the
land
kadmiel
halted
all
black
against
the
pale
green
sky
beyond
the
wood
a
huge
robed
figure
like
the
moses
in
the
rose
i
went
out
and
as
i
shut
the
door
on
that
house
of
foolishness
the
woman
looked
from
the
window
and
whispered
i
have
prevailed
on
my
husband
to
tell
the
king
i
answered
there
is
no
need
the
lord
is
with
me
that
hour
the
lord
gave
me
full
understanding
of
all
that
i
must
do
and
his
hand
covered
me
in
my
ways
first
i
went
to
london
to
a
physician
of
our
people
who
sold
me
certain
drugs
that
i
needed
you
shall
see
why
thence
i
went
swiftly
to
pevensey
men
fought
all
around
me
for
there
were
neither
rulers
nor
judges
in
the
abominable
land
yet
when
i
walked
by
them
they
cried
out
that
i
was
one
ahasuerus
a
jew
condemned
as
they
believe
to
live
for
ever
and
they
fled
from
me
thus
the
lord
saved
me
for
my
work
and
at
pevensey
i
bought
me
a
little
boat
and
moored
it
on
the
mud
beneath
the
of
the
castle
that
also
god
showed
me
he
was
as
calm
as
though
he
were
speaking
of
some
stranger
and
his
voice
filled
the
little
bare
wood
with
rolling
music
cast
his
hand
went
to
his
breast
and
again
the
strange
jewel
gleamed
cast
the
drugs
which
i
had
prepared
into
the
common
well
of
the
castle
nay
i
did
no
harm
the
more
we
physicians
know
the
less
do
we
do
only
the
fool
says
i
dare
i
caused
a
blotched
and
itching
rash
to
break
out
upon
their
skins
but
i
knew
it
would
fade
in
fifteen
days
i
did
not
stretch
out
my
hand
against
their
life
they
in
the
castle
thought
it
was
the
plague
and
they
ran
out
taking
with
them
their
very
dogs
christian
physician
seeing
that
i
was
a
jew
and
a
stranger
vowed
that
i
had
brought
the
sickness
from
london
this
is
the
one
time
i
have
ever
heard
a
christian
leech
speak
truth
of
any
disease
thereupon
the
people
beat
me
but
a
merciful
woman
said
do
not
kill
him
now
push
him
into
our
castle
with
his
plague
and
if
as
he
says
it
will
abate
on
the
fifteenth
day
we
can
kill
him
then
why
not
they
drove
me
across
the
drawbridge
of
the
castle
and
fled
back
to
their
booths
thus
i
came
to
be
alone
with
the
treasure
did
you
know
this
was
all
going
to
happen
just
right
said
una
prophecy
was
that
i
should
be
a
lawgiver
to
a
people
of
a
strange
land
and
a
hard
speech
i
knew
i
should
not
die
i
washed
my
cuts
i
found
the
in
the
wall
and
from
sabbath
to
sabbath
i
dove
and
dug
there
in
that
empty
fortress
he
i
spoiled
the
egyptians
he
if
they
had
only
known
i
drew
up
many
good
loads
of
gold
which
i
loaded
by
night
into
my
boat
there
had
been
gold
dust
too
but
that
had
been
washed
out
by
the
tides
you
ever
wonder
who
had
put
it
there
said
dan
stealing
a
glance
at
puck
calm
dark
face
under
the
hood
of
his
gown
puck
shook
his
head
and
pursed
his
lips
for
the
gold
was
new
to
me
kadmiel
replied
know
the
golds
i
can
judge
them
in
the
dark
but
this
was
heavier
and
redder
than
any
we
deal
in
perhaps
it
was
the
very
gold
of
parvaim
eh
why
not
it
went
to
my
heart
to
heave
it
on
to
the
mud
but
i
saw
well
that
if
the
evil
thing
remained
or
if
even
the
hope
of
finding
it
remained
the
king
would
not
sign
the
new
laws
and
the
land
would
perish
marvel
said
puck
beneath
his
breath
rustling
in
the
dead
leaves
the
boat
was
loaded
i
washed
my
hands
seven
times
and
pared
beneath
my
nails
for
i
would
not
keep
one
grain
i
went
out
by
the
little
gate
where
the
castle
refuse
is
thrown
i
dared
not
hoist
sail
lest
men
should
see
me
but
the
lord
commanded
the
tide
to
bear
me
carefully
and
i
was
far
from
land
before
the
morning
you
afraid
said
una
there
were
no
christians
in
the
boat
at
sunrise
i
made
my
prayer
and
cast
the
gold
all
all
that
gold
into
the
deep
sea
a
king
ransom
no
the
ransom
of
a
people
when
i
had
loosed
hold
of
the
last
bar
the
lord
commanded
the
tide
to
return
me
to
a
haven
at
the
mouth
of
a
river
and
thence
i
walked
across
a
wilderness
to
lewes
where
i
have
brethren
they
opened
the
door
to
me
and
they
say
i
had
not
eaten
for
two
days
they
say
that
i
fell
across
the
threshold
crying
i
have
sunk
an
army
with
horsemen
in
the
sea
you
had
said
una
yes
i
see
you
meant
that
king
john
might
have
spent
it
on
that
so
said
kadmiel
the
firing
broke
out
again
close
behind
them
the
pheasants
poured
over
the
top
of
a
belt
of
tall
firs
they
could
see
young
mr
meyer
in
his
new
yellow
gaiters
very
busy
and
excited
at
the
end
of
the
line
and
they
could
hear
the
thud
of
the
falling
birds
what
did
elias
of
bury
do
puck
demanded
had
promised
money
to
the
king
kadmiel
smiled
grimly
sent
him
word
from
london
that
the
lord
was
on
my
side
when
he
heard
that
the
plague
had
broken
out
in
pevensey
and
that
a
jew
had
been
thrust
into
the
castle
to
cure
it
he
understood
my
word
was
true
he
and
adah
hurried
to
lewes
and
asked
me
for
an
accounting
he
still
looked
on
the
gold
as
his
own
i
told
them
where
i
had
laid
it
and
i
gave
them
full
leave
to
pick
it
up
eh
well
the
curses
of
a
fool
and
the
dust
of
a
journey
are
two
things
no
wise
man
can
escape
but
i
pitied
elias
the
king
was
wroth
with
him
because
he
could
not
lend
the
barons
were
wroth
too
because
they
heard
that
he
would
have
lent
to
the
king
and
adah
was
wroth
with
him
because
she
was
an
odious
woman
they
took
ship
from
lewes
to
spain
that
was
wise
you
did
you
see
the
signing
of
the
law
at
runnymede
said
puck
as
kadmiel
laughed
noiselessly
who
am
i
to
meddle
with
things
too
high
for
me
i
returned
to
bury
and
lent
money
on
the
autumn
crops
why
not
there
was
a
crackle
overhead
a
that
had
sheered
aside
after
being
hit
spattered
down
almost
on
top
of
them
driving
up
the
dry
leaves
like
a
shell
flora
and
folly
threw
themselves
at
it
the
children
rushed
forward
and
when
they
had
beaten
them
off
and
smoothed
down
the
plumage
kadmiel
had
disappeared
said
puck
calmly
did
you
think
of
it
weland
gave
the
sword
the
sword
gave
the
treasure
and
the
treasure
gave
the
law
it
as
natural
as
an
oak
growing
do
understand
did
he
know
it
was
sir
richard
old
treasure
said
dan
why
did
sir
richard
and
brother
hugh
leave
it
lying
about
and
and
mind
said
una
politely
let
us
come
and
go
and
look
and
know
another
time
wo
you
puck
time
maybe
puck
answered
it
cold
and
late
i
race
you
towards
home
they
hurried
down
into
the
sheltered
valley
the
sun
had
almost
sunk
behind
cherry
clack
the
trodden
ground
by
the
was
freezing
at
the
edges
and
the
north
wind
blew
the
night
on
them
from
over
the
hills
they
picked
up
their
feet
and
flew
across
the
browned
pastures
and
when
they
halted
panting
in
the
steam
of
their
own
breath
the
dead
leaves
whirled
up
behind
them
there
was
oak
and
ash
and
thorn
enough
in
that
shower
to
magic
away
a
thousand
memories
so
they
trotted
to
the
brook
at
the
bottom
of
the
lawn
wondering
why
flora
and
folly
had
missed
the
fox
old
hobden
was
just
finishing
some
they
saw
his
white
smock
glimmer
in
the
twilight
where
he
faggoted
the
rubbish
he
come
i
reckon
mus
dan
he
called
times
now
till
heffle
cuckoo
fair
yes
we
all
be
glad
to
see
the
old
woman
let
the
cuckoo
out
o
the
basket
for
to
start
lawful
spring
in
england
they
heard
a
crash
and
a
stamp
and
a
splash
of
water
as
though
a
heavy
old
cow
were
crossing
almost
under
their
noses
hobden
ran
forward
angrily
to
the
ford
bull
again
playin
robin
all
over
the
farm
oh
look
dan
his
great
footmark
as
big
as
a
trencher
no
bounds
to
his
impidence
he
might
count
himself
to
be
a
man
or
or
somebody
a
voice
the
other
side
of
the
brook
boomed
wonder
who
his
cloak
would
turn
when
puck
had
led
him
round
or
where
those
walking
fires
would
burn
then
the
children
went
in
singing
rewards
and
fairies
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
they
had
forgotten
that
they
had
not
even
said
to
puck
the
