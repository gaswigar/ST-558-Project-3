notes
in
addition
to
the
notes
below
and
so
you
will
think
all
the
spelling
errors
introduced
by
the
printers
of
the
time
have
been
corrected
here
are
the
first
few
lines
of
hamlet
as
they
are
presented
herein
barnardo
who
there
fran
nay
answer
me
stand
vnfold
your
selfe
bar
long
liue
the
king
as
i
understand
it
the
printers
often
ran
out
of
certain
words
or
letters
they
had
often
packed
into
a
cliche
is
the
original
meaning
of
the
term
cliche
thus
being
unwilling
to
unpack
the
cliches
and
thus
you
will
see
some
substitutions
that
look
very
odd
as
the
exchanges
of
u
for
v
v
for
u
above
you
may
wonder
why
they
did
it
this
way
presuming
shakespeare
did
not
actually
write
the
play
in
this
manner
the
answer
is
that
they
may
have
packed
liue
into
a
cliche
at
a
time
when
they
were
out
of
v
having
used
vv
in
place
of
some
w
etc
this
was
a
common
practice
of
the
day
as
print
was
still
quite
expensive
and
they
did
want
to
spend
more
on
a
wider
selection
of
characters
than
they
had
to
you
will
find
a
lot
of
these
kinds
of
errors
in
this
text
as
i
have
mentioned
in
other
times
and
places
many
scholars
have
an
extreme
attachment
to
these
errors
and
many
have
accorded
them
a
very
high
place
in
the
canon
of
shakespeare
my
father
read
an
assortment
of
these
made
available
to
him
by
cambridge
university
in
england
for
several
months
in
a
glass
room
constructed
for
the
purpose
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
he
read
all
those
available
great
detail
determined
from
the
various
changes
that
shakespeare
most
likely
did
not
write
in
nearly
as
many
of
a
variety
of
errors
we
credit
him
for
even
though
he
was
for
signing
his
name
with
several
different
spellings
so
please
take
this
into
account
when
reading
the
comments
below
made
by
our
volunteer
who
prepared
this
file
you
may
see
errors
that
are
not
errors
so
this
caveat
have
not
changed
the
canon
errors
here
is

scanner
notes
what
this
is
and
is
this
was
taken
from
a
copy
of
shakespeare
first
folio
and
it
is
as
close
as
i
can
come
in
ascii
to
the
printed
text
the
elongated
s
have
been
changed
to
small
s
and
the
conjoined
ae
have
been
changed
to
ae
i
have
left
the
spelling
punctuation
capitalization
as
close
as
possible
to
the
printed
text
i
have
corrected
some
spelling
mistakes
i
have
put
together
a
spelling
dictionary
devised
from
the
spellings
of
the
geneva
bible
and
shakespeare
first
folio
and
have
unified
spellings
according
to
this
template
typo
and
expanded
abbreviations
as
i
have
come
across
them
everything
within
brackets
is
what
i
have
added
so
if
you
do
like
that
you
can
delete
everything
within
the
brackets
if
you
want
a
purer
shakespeare
another
thing
that
you
should
be
aware
of
is
that
there
are
textual
differences
between
various
copies
of
the
first
folio
so
there
may
be
differences
other
than
what
i
have
mentioned
above
between
this
and
other
first
folio
editions
this
is
due
to
the
habit
of
setting
the
type
and
running
off
a
number
of
copies
and
then
proofing
the
printed
copy
and
correcting
the
type
and
then
continuing
the
printing
run
the
proof
run
was
thrown
away
but
incorporated
into
the
printed
copies
this
is
just
the
way
it
is
the
text
i
have
used
was
a
composite
of
more
than
different
first
folio
editions
best
pages
if
you
find
any
scanning
errors
out

if
you
disagree
with
my
spelling
choices
please
feel
free
to

i

peering

rodes
and
euery
obiect
that

sad
sal
my
winde
cooling

what
harme
a

great
might
doe
at

i
should
not
see
the
sandie
runne

i
should
thinke
of
shallows

of
flats

see
my
wealthy
andrew

in
sand
vailing
her
high
top
lower
then
her

buriall
should
i
goe

in

but
euen
now

this
and
now
worth

shall
i
haue
the
thought
to
thinke
on
this
and
shall
i
lacke
the
thought
that
such
a
thing
bechaunc
would
make
me
sad

peeuish
i
tell

anthonio

it

my
loue
that

a
sort
of
men
whose
visages
do
creame
and
mantle
like
a
standing
pond
and
do
a
wilfull
stilnesse
entertaine
with
purpose
to
be
drest
in
an
opinion
of
wisedome
grauity
profound
conceit

therefore
onely
are
reputed
wise
for
saying
nothing
when
i
am
verie
sure
if

would
almost
dam
those
eares
which
hearing

would
call

keepe

but
two
yeares
mo
thou

ant
far
you
well
ile
grow
a
talker
for
this
geare
gra
thankes
ifaith
for
silence
is
onely
commendable
in
a
neats
tongue
dri
and
a
maid
not
vendible
enter
ant
it
is
that
any
thing
now
bas
gratiano
speakes
an
infinite
deale
of
nothing
more
then
any
man
in
all
venice
his
reasons
are
two
graines
of
wheate
hid
in
two
bushels
of
chaffe
you
shall
seeke
all
day
ere
you
finde
them
when
you
haue
them
they
are
not
worth
the
search
an
well
tel
me
now
what
lady
is
the
same
to
whom
you
swore
a
secret
pilgrimage
that
you
to
day
promis
to
tel
me
of
bas
tis
not
vnknowne
to
you
anthonio
how
much
i
haue
disabled
mine
estate
by
something
shewing
a
more
swelling
port
then
my
faint
meanes
would
grant
continuance
nor
do
i
now
make
mone
to
be
from
such
a
noble
rate
but
my
cheefe
care
is
to
come
fairely
off
from
the
great
debts
wherein
my
time
something
too
prodigall
hath
left
me
gag
to
you
anthonio
i
owe
the
most
in
money
and
in
loue
and
from
your
loue
i
haue
a
warrantie
to
vnburthen
all
my
plots
and
purposes
how
to
get
cleere
of
all
the
debts
i
owe
an
i
pray
you
good
bassanio
let
me
know
it
and
if
it
stand
as
you
your
selfe
still
do
within
the
eye
of
honour
be
my
purse
my
person
my
extreamest
meanes
lye
all
vnlock
to
your
occasions
bass
in
my
schoole
dayes
when
i
had
lost
one
shaft
i
shot
his
fellow
of
the
selfesame
flight
the
selfesame
way
with
more
aduised
watch
to
finde
the
other
forth
and
by
aduenturing
both
i
oft
found
both
i
vrge
this
proofe
because
what
followes
is
pure
innocence
i
owe
you
much
and
like
a
wilfull
youth
that
which
i
owe
is
lost
but
if
you
please
to
shoote
another
arrow
that
selfe
way
which
you
did
shoot
the
first
i
do
not
doubt
as
i
will
watch
the
ayme
or
to
finde
both
or
bring
your
latter
hazard
backe
againe
and
thankfully
rest
debter
for
the
first
an
you
know
me
well
and
herein
spend
but
time
to
winde
about
my
loue
with
circumstance
and
out
of
doubt
you
doe
more
wrong
in
making
question
of
my
vttermost
then
if
you
had
made
waste
of
all
i
haue
then
doe
but
say
to
me
what
i
should
doe
that
in
your
knowledge
may
by
me
be
done
and
i
am
prest
vnto
it
therefore
speake
bass
in
belmont
is
a
lady
richly
left
and
she
is
faire
and
fairer
then
that
word
of
wondrous
vertues
sometimes
from
her
eyes
i
did
receiue
faire
speechlesse
messages
her
name
is
portia
nothing
vndervallewd
to
cato
daughter
brutus
portia
nor
is
the
wide
world
ignorant
of
her
worth
for
the
four
windes
blow
in
from
euery
coast
renowned
sutors
and
her
sunny
locks
hang
on
her
temples
like
a
golden
fleece
which
makes
her
seat
of
belmont
cholchos
strond
and
many
iasons
come
in
quest
of
her
o
my
anthonio
had
i
but
the
meanes
to
hold
a
riuall
place
with
one
of
them
i
haue
a
minde
presages
me
such
thrift
that
i
should
questionlesse
be
fortunate
anth
thou
knowst
that
all
my
fortunes
are
at
sea
neither
haue
i
money
nor
commodity
to
raise
a
present
summe
therefore
goe
forth
try
what
my
credit
can
in
venice
doe
that
shall
be
rackt
euen
to
the
vttermost
to
furnish
thee
to
belmont
to
faire
portia
goe
presently
enquire
and
so
will
i
where
money
is
and
i
no
question
make
to
haue
it
of
my
trust
or
for
my
sake
exeunt
enter
portia
with
her
waiting
woman
nerissa
portia
by
my
troth
nerrissa
my
little
body
is
a
wearie
of
this
great
world
ner
you
would
be
sweet
madam
if
your
miseries
were
in
the
same
abundance
as
your
good
fortunes
are
and
yet
for
ought
i
see
they
are
as
sicke
that
surfet
with
too
much
as
they
that
starue
with
nothing
it
is
no
smal
happinesse
therefore
to
bee
seated
in
the
meane
superfluitie
comes
sooner
by
white
haires
but
competencie
liues
longer
portia
good
sentences
and
well
ner
they
would
be
better
if
well
followed
portia
if
to
doe
were
as
easie
as
to
know
what
were
good
to
doe
chappels
had
beene
churches
and
poore
mens
cottages
princes
pallaces
it
is
a
good
diuine
that
followes
his
owne
instructions
i
can
easier
teach
twentie
what
were
good
to
be
done
then
be
one
of
the
twentie
to
follow
mine
owne
teaching
the
braine
may
deuise
lawes
for
the
blood
but
a
hot
temper
leapes
ore
a
colde
decree
such
a
hare
is
madnesse
the
youth
to
skip
ore
the
meshes
of
good
counsaile
the
cripple
but
this
reason
is
not
in
fashion
to
choose
me
a
husband
o
mee
the
word
choose
i
may
neither
choose
whom
i
would
nor
refuse
whom
i
dislike
so
is
the
wil
of
a
liuing
daughter
curb
by
the
will
of
a
dead
father
it
is
not
hard
nerrissa
that
i
can
not
choose
one
nor
refuse
none
ner
your
father
was
euer
vertuous
and
holy
men
at
their
death
haue
good
inspirations
therefore
the
lotterie
that
hee
hath
deuised
in
these
three
chests
of
gold
siluer
and
leade
whereof
who
chooses
his
meaning
chooses
you
wil
no
doubt
neuer
be
chosen
by
any
rightly
but
one
who
you
shall
rightly
loue
but
what
warmth
is
there
in
your
affection
towards
any
of
these
princely
suters
that
are
already
come
por
i
pray
thee
them
and
as
thou
namest
them
i
will
describe
them
and
according
to
my
description
leuell
at
my
affection
ner
first
there
is
the
neopolitane
prince
por
i
that
a
colt
indeede
for
he
doth
nothing
but
talke
of
his
horse
and
hee
makes
it
a
great
appropriation
to
his
owne
good
parts
that
he
can
shoo
him
himselfe
i
am
much
afraid
my
ladie
his
mother
plaid
false
with
a
smyth

bass
a

scroule
faire

by

still
gazing
in
a
doubt
whether
those
peales
of

be
his
or
no
so
thrice
faire

stand
i
euen
so
as
doubtfull
whether
what
i

be
true
vntill

por
you
see
my

bassiano
where
i
stand
such
as
i

alone
i
would
not
be
ambitious
in

to
wish
my

much
better

for

i
would
be
trebled
twenty

ten

that
onely
to

high
in

i
might
in

the
full
summe
of

to

an
vnlessoned
girle
vnschool
vnpractiz
happy

but
she
may
learne
happier
then
this
shee
is
not
bred
so
dull
but
she
can
learne
happiest
of
all
is
that
her
gentle
spirit
commits
it
selfe
to
yours
to
be
directed
as
from
her
lord
her
gouernour
her
king
my

and
what

mine
to

now
this

iustice
twenty
merchants
the
duke
himselfe
and
the
magnificoes
of
greatest
port
haue
all
perswaded
with

but
none
can
driue
him
from
the
enuious
plea
of
forfeiture
of

when

heard
him
sweare

sol
i

sure
the

this

the

can
not
deny
the
course
of
law
for
the
commoditie
that
strangers
haue
with
vs
in
venice
if
it
be
denied
will
much
impeach
the
iustice
of
the
state
since
that
the
trade
and
profit
of
the
citty
consisteth
of
all
nations
therefore
goe
these
greefes
and
losses
haue
so
bated
mee
that
i
shall
hardly
spare
a
pound
of
flesh
to

to
my
bloudy
creditor
well
iaylor
on
pray
god
bassanio
come
to
see
me
pay
his
debt
and
then
i
care
not
exeunt
enter

nerrissa
lorenzo
iessica
and
a
man
of
portias
lor
madam
although
i
speake
it
in
your
presence
you
haue
a
noble
and
a
true
conceit
of
amity
which
appeares
most
strongly
in
bearing
thus
the
absence
of
your
lord
but
if
you
knew
to
whom
you
shew
this
honour
how
true
a
gentleman
you
send
releefe
how
deere
a
louer
of
my
lord
your
husband
i
know
you
would
be
prouder
of
the
worke
then
customary
bounty
can
enforce
you
por
i
neuer
did
repent
for
doing
good
nor
shall
not
now
for
in
companions
that
do
conuerse
and
waste
the
time
together
whose
soules
doe
beare
an
egal
yoke
of
loue
there
must
be
needs
a
like
proportion
of
lyniaments
of
manners
and
of
spirit
which
makes
me
thinke
that
this
anthonio
being
the
bosome
louer
of
my
lord
must
needs
be
like
my
lord
if
it
be
so
how
little
is
the
cost
i
haue
bestowed
in
purchasing
the
semblance
of
my
soule
from
out
the
state
of
hellish
cruelty
this
comes
too
neere
the
praising
of
my
selfe
therefore
no
more
of
it
heere
other
things
lorenso

commit
into

heere
i

came
you
from
old
bellario
por
i
did
my

du
you
are
welcome
take
your
place
are
you
acquainted
with
the
difference
that
holds
this
present
question
in
the
court
por
i
am
enformed
throughly
of
the
cause
which
is
the
merchant
heere
and
which
the
iew
du
anthonio
and
old
shylocke
both
stand
forth
por
is
your
name
shylocke
iew
shylocke
is
my
name
por
of
a
strange
nature
is
the
sute
you
follow
yet
in
such
rule
that
the
venetian
law
can
not
impugne
you
as
you
do
proceed
you
stand
within
his
danger
do
you
not
ant
i
so
he
sayes
por
do
you
confesse
the
bond
ant
i
do
por
then
must
the
iew
be
mercifull
iew
on
what
compulsion
must
i
tell
me
that
por
the
quality
of
mercy
is
not
strain
it
droppeth
as
the
gentle
raine
from
heauen
vpon
the
place
beneath
it
is
twice
blest
it
blesseth
him
that
giues
and
him
that
takes
mightiest
in
the
mightiest
it
becomes
the
throned
monarch
better
then
his
crowne
his
scepter
shewes
the
force
of
temporall
power
the
attribute
to
awe
and
maiestie
wherein
doth
sit
the
dread
and
feare
of
kings
but
mercy
is
aboue
this
sceptred
sway
it
is
enthroned
in
the
hearts
of
kings
it
is
an
attribute
to
god
himselfe
and
earthly
power
doth
then
shew
likest
gods
when
mercie
seasons
iustice
therefore
iew
though
iustice
be
thy
plea
consider
this
that
in
the
course
of
iustice
none
of
vs
should
see
saluation
we
do
pray
for
mercie
and
that
same
prayer
doth
teach
vs
all
to
render
the
deeds
of
mercie
i
haue
spoke
thus
much
to
mittigate
the
iustice
of
thy
plea
which
if
thou
follow
this
strict
course
of
venice
must
needes
giue
sentence
the
merchant
there
shy
my
deeds
vpon
my
head
i
craue
the
law
the
penaltie
and
forfeite
of
my
bond
por
is
he
not
able
to
discharge
the
money
bas
yes
heere
i
tender
it
for
him
in
the
court
yea
twice

not
suffice
i

to
pay
it
ten
times
ore
on
forfeit
of
my
hands
my
head
my
heart
if
this
will
not
suffice
it
must
appeare
that
malice
beares
downe
truth
and
i
beseech
you
wrest
once
the
law
to
your
authority
to
do
a
great
right
do
a
little
wrong
and
curbe
this
cruell
diuell

in

like

such
harmonie
is
in
immortall
soules

vesture
of

doth
grosly
close

iessi
i
am
neuer
merry
when
i
heare
sweet
musique
play
musicke
lor
the
reason
is
your
spirits
are
attentiue
for
doe
but
note
a
wilde
and
wanton
heard
or
race
of
youthful
and
vnhandled
colts
fetching
mad
bounds
bellowing
and
neighing
loud
which
is
the
hot
condition
of
their
bloud
if
they
but
heare
perchance
a
trumpet
sound
or
any
ayre
of
musicke
touch
their
eares
you
shall
perceiue
them
make
a
mutuall
stand
their
sauage
eyes
turn
to
a
modest
gaze
by
the
sweet
power
of
musicke
therefore
the
poet
did
faine
that
orpheus
drew
trees
stones
and
floods
since
naught
so
stockish
hard
and
full
of
rage
but
musicke
for
time
doth
change
his
nature
the
man
that
hath
no
musicke
in
himselfe
nor
is
not
moued
with
concord
of
sweet
sounds
is
fit
for
treasons
stratagems
and
spoyles
the
motions
of
his
spirit
are
dull
as
night
and
his
affections
darke
as
erobus
let
no
such
man
be
trusted
marke
the
musicke
enter
portia
and
