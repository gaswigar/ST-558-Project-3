knyght
ther
was
and
that
a
worthy
man
that
fro
the
tyme
that
he
first
bigan
to
ryden
out
he
loved
chivalrye
trouthe
and
honour
fredom
and
the
canterbury
tales
i
mallory
who
among
other
things
was
a
the
boat
in
the
eastern
section
of
a
secluded
valley
in
ancient
britain
and
typed
castle
early
on
the
lumillusion
panel
then
he
stepped
over
to
the
telewindow
and
studied
the
screen
the
hour
was
the
season
summer
the
year
darkness
was
on
hand
but
there
was
a
full
moon
rising
and
he
could
see
trees
not
far
away
oaks
and
beeches
mostly
roving
the
eye
of
the
camera
he
saw
more
trees
of
the
same
species
the
castle
of
yore
was
safely
ensconced
in
a
forest
satisfied
he
turned
away
if
his
calculations
were
correct
the
castle
of
carbonek
stood
in
the
next
valley
to
the
south
and
on
a
silver
table
in
a
chamber
of
the
castle
stood
the
object
of
his
quest
his
calculations
were
correct
mallory
was
not
one
to
keep
himself
in
suspense
stepping
into
the
supply
room
he
stripped
down
to
his
undergarments
and
proceeded
to
get
into
the
suit
of
armor
which
he
had
purchased
expressly
for
the
operation
fortunately
while
duplication
of
early
design
had
been
mandatory
there
had
been
no
need
to
duplicate
early
materials
and
sollerets
spurs
greaves
cuisses
breastplate
pauldrons
gorget
gauntlets
helmet
and
vest
had
all
been
fashioned
of
alloys
that
lent
ten
times
as
much
protection
at
ten
times
less
poundage
the
helmet
was
his
particular
pride
and
joy
in
keeping
with
the
after
which
it
had
been
patterned
it
looked
like
an
metal
wastepaper
basket
but
the
transparency
of
the
special
alloy
that
had
gone
into
its
construction
gave
him
unrestricted
vision
while
two
inbuilt
performed
a
corresponding
service
for
his
hearing
the
outer
surface
of
each
piece
had
been
burnished
to
a
high
degree
and
he
found
himself
a
dazzling
sight
indeed
when
he
looked
into
the
mirror
this
effect
was
enhanced
no
end
when
he
buckled
on
his
scabbard
and
sword
and
hung
his
shield
around
his
neck
his
polished
spear
when
he
stood
it
beside
him
was
almost
anticlimactic
it
should
have
been
it
was
a
good
three
and
inches
in
diameter
at
the
base
and
it
was
as
tall
as
a
young
flagpole
as
he
stood
there
looking
at
his
reflection
the
red
cross
in
the
center
of
the
shield
took
on
the
hue
of
blood
the
expert
who
had
designed
the
shield
had
insisted
on
the
illusion
saying
that
it
made
for
greater
authenticity
and
mallory
had
argued
with
him
he
was
glad
now
that
he
had
raising
the
visor
of
his
helmet
he
winked
at
himself
and
said
i
hereby
christen
ye
galahad
next
he
bethought
himself
of
his
steed
armor
clanking
he
left
the
supply
room
and
walked
down
the
short
passage
to
the
the
occupied
the
entire
forward
section
of
the
tsb
and
had
been
designed
solely
for
the
benefit
of
the
whom
mallory
regularly
conducted
on
as
a
for
the
illegal
activities
which
he
pursued
in
between
trips
in
the
present
instance
however
the
hall
went
quite
well
with
the
lumillusioned
exterior
possessing
with
its
mezzanine
its
long
snack
table
and
its
imitation
flagstone
flooring
an
early
aspect
of
its
own
an
aspect
marred
only
slightly
by
the
anachronistic
telewindows
inset
at
regular
intervals
along
the
walls
mallory
steed
stood
in
a
enclosure
that
was
formed
by
the
and
one
of
the
walls
and
it
was
a
splendid
beast
indeed
as
splendid
a
one
as
the
century
robotics
industry
was
capable
of
creating
originally
mallory
had
planned
on
bringing
a
real
horse
with
him
but
as
this
would
have
necessitated
his
having
to
learn
how
to
ride
he
had
decided
against
it
the
decision
had
been
a
wise
one
easy
money
looked
more
like
a
horse
than
most
real
horses
did
could
travel
twice
as
fast
and
was
as
easy
to
ride
and
to
maneuver
as
a
golp
jetney
it
was
in
color
with
a
white
diamond
on
its
forehead
it
was
equipped
with
a
secret
and
an
inbuilt
saddle
and
its
trappings
were
made
of
genuine
synthisilk
threaded
with
gold
it
wore
no
armor
it
did
not
need
to
weapons
manufactured
during
the
age
of
chivalry
could
no
more
penetrate
its
hide
than
a
tooth
pick
could
on
easy
mallory
encephalopathed
and
i
have
a
little
job
to
the
rohorse
emitted
several
realistic
whinnies
backed
out
of
its
stall
trotted
smartly
over
to
his
side
and
nuzzled
his
right
pauldron
mallory
mounted
not
gracefully
it
is
true
but
at
least
without
the
aid
of
the
winch
he
would
have
needed
if
his
armor
had
been
manufactured
in
the
sixth
century
and
inserted
the
red
pommel
of
his
spear
in
the
stirrup
socket
then
activating
the
lock
he
rode
across
the
imaginary
drawbridge
that
spanned
the
and
set
forth
into
the
forest
as
the
portcullis
closed
behind
him
symbolically
bringing
phase
one
of
operation
sangraal
to
a
close
he
thought
of
jason
perfidion
standing
in
front
of
the
fireplace
in
the
big
balconied
room
perfidion
said
mallory
you
wasting
your
time
worse
you
wasting
mine
the
room
climaxed
a
vertical
series
of
slightly
less
sumptuous
chambers
known
collectively
as
the
perfidion
tower
and
the
perfidion
tower
stood
with
a
score
of
balconied
brothers
on
a
blacktop
island
in
the
exact
center
of
kansas
largest
golp
course
a
short
distance
from
the
fraternal
gathering
stood
yet
another
tower
the
false
tower
into
which
mallory
had
lumillusioned
his
tsb
upon
his
arrival
on
the
golp
terrace
as
the
blacktop
island
was
called
everyone
and
everything
conformed
or
else
the
room
itself
was
known
to
as
perfidion
lair
and
yet
there
was
nothing
about
jason
perfidion
nothing
physical
that
is
that
suggested
the
predator
he
was
mallory
age
tall
dark
of
hair
and
strikingly
handsome
he
looked
like
and
was
a
highly
successful
businessman
with
a
triplex
on
street
and
he
gave
the
impression
that
he
was
as
honest
as
the
day
was
long
just
the
same
the
predator
was
there
and
if
you
were
alert
enough
you
could
sometimes
glimpse
it
peering
out
through
the
smoky
windowpanes
of
his
eyes
it
was
peering
out
now
though
it
was
sleeping
however
it
was
due
to
wake
up
any
second
then
you
not
interested
in
fencing
the
holy
grail
mallory
asked
annoyance
intensified
the
slight
swarthiness
of
perfidion
cheeks
mallory
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
the
grail
never
really
existed
that
it
was
nothing
more
than
the
daydream
of
a
bunch
of
quixotic
knights
so
go
and
get
your
hair
cut
and
forget
about
it
but
suppose
it
exist
mallory
insisted
suppose
tomorrow
afternoon
at
this
time
i
were
to
come
in
here
and
set
it
down
on
this
desk
here
how
much
could
you
get
for
it
perfidion
laughed
how
much
i
get
for
it
why
without
even
stopping
to
think
i
can
name
you
a
dozen
collectors
who
give
their
right
arm
for
it
i
not
interested
in
right
arms
mallory
said
i
interested
in
dollars
how
many
kennedees
could
you
get
for
it
a
megamillion
maybe
more
more
than
enough
certainly
to
permit
you
to
retire
from
and
to
take
up
residence
on
street
but
it
does
exist
and
it
never
did
so
get
out
of
here
mallory
and
stop
squandering
my
valuable
time
mallory
withdrew
a
small
stereophoto
from
his
breast
pocket
and
tossed
it
on
the
desk
have
a
look
at
that
first
then
i
go
he
said
perfidion
picked
up
the
photo
an
ordinary
enough
yellow
bowl
he
began
and
stopped
suddenly
he
gasped
and
jabbed
one
of
the
many
buttons
that
patterned
his
desktop
seconds
later
a
svelte
blonde
whom
mallory
had
never
seen
before
stepped
out
of
the
lift
tube
like
most
secretaries
she
wore
a
maximum
of
makeup
and
a
minimum
of
clothing
and
moved
in
an
aura
of
efficiency
and
sex
get
me
my
miss
tyler
perfidion
said
when
she
returned
with
it
he
set
it
on
his
desk
and
inserted
the
stereophoto
instantly
a
huge
cube
materialized
in
the
center
of
the
room
inside
the
cube
there
was
a
realistic
image
of
a
resplendent
silver
table
and
upon
the
image
of
the
table
stood
an
equally
realistic
image
of
a
resplendent
golden
bowl
perfidion
gasped
again
unusual
workmanship
would
you
say
mallory
said
perfidion
turned
toward
the
blonde
you
may
go
miss
tyler
she
was
staring
at
the
contents
of
the
cube
and
apparently
did
not
hear
him
i
said
he
repeated
that
you
may
go
miss
tyler
oh
yes
yes
sir
when
the
door
closed
behind
her
perfidion
turned
to
mallory
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
the
predator
was
visible
behind
the
smoky
windowpanes
of
his
eyes
then
quickly
it
ducked
out
of
sight
where
was
this
taken
tom
it
a
mallory
said
i
took
it
through
one
of
the
windows
of
the
church
joseph
of
arimathea
built
in
glastonbury
but
how
did
you
know
that
it
was
there
because
it
to
be
there
some
time
ago
while
escorting
a
group
of
tourists
around
ancient
britain
i
happened
to
witness
joseph
of
arimathea
landing
and
happened
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
what
he
brought
with
him
i
used
to
think
that
the
grail
was
a
pipe
dream
too
but
when
i
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
i
knew
that
it
could
have
been
however
i
knew
i
need
evidence
to
convince
you
so
i
jumped
back
to
a
later
and
got
a
shot
of
it
but
why
a
shot
tom
why
did
you
lift
it
then
and
there
you
concede
that
it
is
the
grail
then
of
course
it
the
grail
there
not
the
slightest
question
about
it
why
did
you
lift
it
well
for
one
thing
i
wanted
to
make
sure
that
lifting
it
would
be
worth
my
while
and
for
another
glastonbury
was
the
logical
from
which
to
lift
it
because
assuming
that
the
rest
of
the
legend
is
also
true
it
was
seen
after
that
no
ever
bucked
destiny
yet
and
came
out
the
winner
jason
i
play
my
percentages
i
know
you
do
tom
you
one
of
the
best
men
in
the
business
and
the
past
police
would
be
the
first
to
admit
it
i
daresay
you
already
pinpointed
the
key
mallory
grinned
showing
his
white
teeth
i
certainly
have
but
if
you
think
i
going
to
divulge
it
you
sadly
mistaken
jason
and
stop
looking
at
my
hair
it
wo
tell
you
anything
beyond
the
fact
that
i
been
using
hair
was
the
rage
in
more
eras
than
one
perfidion
smiled
warmly
and
clapped
mallory
on
the
back
i
not
trying
to
ferret
out
your
secret
tom
i
know
better
than
that
lifting
is
your
line
fencing
mine
you
bring
me
the
grail
i
sell
it
take
my
cut
and
everything
will
be
fine
you
know
me
tom
i
sure
do
mallory
said
taking
the
stereophoto
out
of
the
projector
and
returning
it
to
his
breast
pocket
perfidion
snapped
his
fingers
a
happy
thought
just
occurred
to
me
i
got
a
golp
date
with
rowley
of
puriproducts
so
why
do
you
join
us
tom
you
play
a
pretty
good
game
as
i
recall
mollified
mallory
said
i
have
to
borrow
a
set
of
your
jetsticks
i
get
them
for
you
on
the
way
down
come
on
tom
mallory
accompanied
him
across
the
room
keep
mum
about
this
to
rowley
now
perfidion
said
confidentially
he
a
potential
customer
but
we
do
want
to
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
yet
do
we
or
should
i
say
grail
he
took
time
out
to
grin
at
his
little
joke
then
by
the
way
tom
i
take
it
you
all
set
as
regards
costume
equipment
and
the
like
i
got
the
sweetest
little
suit
of
armor
you
ever
laid
eyes
on
mallory
said
fine
no
need
for
me
to
offer
any
advice
in
that
respect
then
perfidion
opened
the
lift
door
after
you
tom
they
plummeted
down
the
tube
together
it
had
been
a
good
game
of
golp
from
mallory
standpoint
anyway
he
had
trounced
rowley
roundly
and
he
would
have
inflicted
similar
ignominy
upon
perfidion
had
not
the
latter
been
called
away
in
the
middle
of
the
game
and
been
unable
to
return
till
it
was
nearly
over
oh
well
mallory
thought
his
rohorse
through
the
ancient
forest
there
be
other
chances
aloud
he
said
step
lively
now
easy
money
and
let
get
this
caper
over
with
so
we
can
return
to
civilization
and
start
feeling
what
it
like
to
be
rich
in
response
to
the
that
had
accompanied
his
words
easy
money
increased
its
pace
the
rays
of
its
eye
units
illumining
its
way
in
places
light
from
the
rising
moon
seeped
through
the
foliage
but
otherwise
darkness
was
the
rule
the
air
was
cool
and
damp
the
sea
was
not
far
distant
and
the
sound
of
frogs
and
insects
was
omnipresent
and
now
and
then
there
was
the
rustling
sound
of
some
small
and
fleeing
forest
creature
presently
the
ground
began
to
rise
and
not
long
afterward
the
trees
thinned
out
temporarily
and
rohorse
and
rider
emerged
on
the
moonlit
crest
of
the
ridge
that
separated
the
two
valleys
in
the
distance
mallory
made
out
the
towers
and
turrets
of
a
large
castle
and
knew
it
to
be
carbonek
beyond
a
doubt
he
sighed
with
relief
he
was
all
set
now
provided
his
masquerade
went
over
conversely
if
it
did
go
over
he
was
finished
his
sword
and
his
spear
were
his
only
weapons
and
his
shield
and
his
armor
his
only
protection
true
each
article
was
superior
in
quality
and
durability
to
its
corresponding
article
in
the
age
of
chivalry
but
otherwise
none
of
them
was
anything
more
than
what
it
seemed
mallory
might
be
a
but
within
the
framework
of
his
profession
he
believed
in
playing
fair
in
response
to
his
encephalopathed
directions
easy
money
picked
its
way
down
the
slope
of
the
ridge
and
the
forest
not
long
afterward
it
stepped
onto
what
was
euphemistically
referred
to
in
that
day
and
age
as
a
highway
but
which
in
reality
was
little
more
than
a
wide
lane
as
mallory
entire
plan
of
action
was
based
on
boldness
he
spurned
the
shadows
of
the
bordering
oaks
and
beeches
and
encephalopathed
the
rohorse
to
keep
to
the
center
of
the
lane
he
met
no
one
however
despite
the
earliness
of
the
hour
nor
had
he
really
expected
to
it
was
highly
improbable
that
any
freemen
would
be
abroad
after
dark
and
as
for
the
who
happened
to
be
in
the
neighborhood
it
was
highly
improbable
that
any
of
them
would
be
abroad
after
dark
either
he
grinned
to
read
morte
you
think
that
the
chivalry
boys
had
been
in
business
hours
a
day
slaying
ogres
rescuing
fair
damosels
and
searching
for
the
sangraal
but
not
if
you
read
between
the
lines
mallory
had
read
arthur
only
cursorily
but
he
had
had
a
hunch
all
along
that
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
quest
for
the
sangraal
had
served
as
an
out
and
that
the
knights
of
the
table
round
had
spent
more
time
wenching
and
wassailing
than
they
had
conducting
their
dedicated
search
and
the
hunch
had
played
an
important
role
in
the
shaping
of
his
strategy
the
highway
turned
this
way
and
that
never
pursuing
a
straight
course
unless
such
a
logical
procedure
was
unavoidable
once
he
thought
he
heard
hoofbeats
up
ahead
but
he
met
no
one
and
not
long
afterward
he
saw
the
pale
pile
of
carbonek
looming
above
the
trees
to
his
left
and
easy
money
into
the
lane
that
led
to
the
entrance
there
was
no
moat
but
the
portcullis
was
an
imposing
one
flanking
it
on
either
side
was
a
huge
stone
lion
and
framing
it
were
flaming
torches
in
niches
warders
in
hauberk
and
helmet
looked
down
from
the
lofty
wall
their
halberds
gleaming
in
the
dancing
torchlight
mallory
swallowed
the
moment
of
truth
had
arrived
he
halted
easy
money
and
canted
his
white
shield
so
that
the
red
cross
in
its
center
would
be
visible
from
above
then
he
marshalled
his
smattering
of
old
english
i
hight
sir
galahad
of
the
table
round
he
called
out
in
as
bold
a
voice
as
he
could
muster
i
would
rest
my
eyes
upon
the
sangraal
instantly
confusion
reigned
upon
the
wall
as
the
warders
vied
with
one
another
for
the
privilege
of
operating
the
cumbersome
windlass
that
raised
and
lowered
the
portcullis
and
presently
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
chorus
of
creaks
and
groans
and
scrapings
the
ponderous
iron
grating
began
to
rise
mallory
forced
himself
to
wait
until
it
had
risen
to
a
height
befitting
a
knight
of
sir
caliber
then
he
rode
through
the
gateway
and
into
the
courtyard
congratulating
himself
on
the
effectiveness
of
his
impersonation
ye
will
come
unto
the
chamber
of
the
sangraal
sixty
paces
down
the
corridor
to
thy
left
eftsoon
ye
enter
the
chief
fortress
sir
knight
one
of
the
warders
called
down
an
ye
had
arrived
a
little
while
afore
ye
had
encountered
sir
launcelot
du
lake
the
which
did
come
unto
the
fortress
and
enter
in
wherefrom
he
came
out
anon
and
departed
mallory
would
have
wiped
his
forehead
if
his
forehead
had
been
accessible
and
if
his
hands
had
not
been
encased
in
metal
gloves
fooling
the
warders
was
one
thing
but
passing
himself
off
as
sir
galahad
to
the
man
who
was
sir
galahad
father
would
have
been
quite
another
he
had
learned
from
the
pages
of
his
arthur
that
sir
launcelot
had
visited
carbonek
before
sir
galahad
had
but
the
pages
had
not
revealed
whether
the
had
involved
minutes
hours
or
years
and
for
that
matter
mallory
altogether
certain
whether
the
second
visit
they
described
had
been
the
real
sir
galahad
which
meant
failure
or
a
romanticized
version
of
his
own
which
meant
success
his
was
murky
at
best
and
reading
him
you
were
never
sure
where
anybody
was
or
when
any
given
event
was
taking
place
the
courtyard
was
empty
and
after
crossing
it
mallory
dismounted
encephalopathed
easy
money
to
stay
put
and
climbed
the
series
of
stone
steps
that
led
to
the
castle
proper
entering
the
building
unchallenged
he
found
himself
at
the
junction
of
three
corridors
the
main
one
stretched
straight
ahead
and
debouched
into
a
large
hall
the
other
two
led
off
at
right
angles
one
to
the
left
and
one
to
the
right
boisterous
laughter
emanated
from
the
hall
and
he
could
see
knights
and
other
nobles
sitting
at
a
long
banquet
table
scattered
among
them
were
gentlewomen
in
rich
silks
and
hovering
behind
them
were
servants
bearing
large
demijohns
he
grinned
just
as
he
had
figured
king
pelles
was
throwing
a
whingding
quickly
mallory
turned
down
the
corridor
and
started
along
it
counting
his
footsteps
rushes
rustled
beneath
his
feet
and
the
flickering
light
of
gave
him
a
series
of
grotesque
shadows
he
saw
no
one
all
the
servants
were
in
the
banquet
hall
pouring
wine
and
mead
he
laughed
aloud
paces
sufficed
to
see
him
to
the
chamber
door
it
was
a
perfectly
ordinary
door
opening
it
he
thought
at
first
that
the
room
beyond
was
ordinary
too
then
he
saw
the
burning
candles
arranged
along
the
walls
and
beneath
them
standing
in
the
center
of
the
floor
the
table
of
silver
the
table
of
the
sangraal
there
was
no
sangraal
on
the
table
however
there
was
no
sangraal
in
the
room
for
that
matter
there
was
a
girl
though
she
was
huddled
forlornly
in
a
corner
and
she
was
crying
ii
mallory
laid
his
spear
aside
strode
across
the
room
and
raised
the
girl
to
her
feet
the
sangraal
he
said
forgetting
in
his
agitation
the
few
odds
and
ends
of
old
english
he
had
memorized
where
is
it
she
raised
startled
eyes
that
were
as
round
and
almost
as
large
as
plums
her
face
was
round
too
and
faintly
childlike
her
hair
was
and
done
up
in
a
strange
and
indeterminate
coiffeur
that
was
as
charming
as
it
was
disconcerting
her
dress
was
white
and
there
was
a
bow
on
the
bodice
that
matched
the
of
her
eyes
a
few
cosmetics
properly
applied
would
have
turned
her
into
an
attractive
woman
and
even
without
them
she
rated
a
second
look
she
stared
at
him
for
some
time
then
surely
ye
be
an
advision
sir
she
said
i
i
know
ye
not
mallory
swung
his
shield
around
so
that
she
could
see
the
red
cross
now
do
you
know
me
she
gasped
and
her
eyes
grew
even
rounder
sir
sir
galahad
oh
fair
knight
wherefore
did
ye
not
say
mallory
ignored
the
question
the
sangraal
he
repeated
where
is
it
her
tears
had
ceased
temporarily
now
they
began
again
oh
fair
sir
she
cried
ye
see
tofore
you
a
damosel
at
mischief
the
which
was
given
guardianship
of
the
holy
vessel
at
her
own
request
and
bewrayed
her
trust
a
damosel
never
mind
all
that
mallory
said
where
the
sangraal
i
wot
not
fair
sir
but
you
must
know
if
you
were
guarding
it
i
wot
not
whither
it
was
taken
but
you
must
wot
who
took
it
wot
i
well
fair
knight
sir
launcelot
the
which
is
thy
father
bare
it
from
the
chamber
mallory
was
stunned
but
that
impossible
my
fa
sir
launcelot
would
steal
the
sangraal
well
i
wot
fair
sir
yet
steal
it
he
did
came
he
unto
the
chamber
and
saith
i
hight
sir
launcelot
du
lake
of
the
table
round
whereat
i
did
see
his
armor
to
be
none
other
so
then
took
he
the
vessel
covered
with
the
red
samite
and
bare
it
with
him
from
the
chamber
whereat
i
how
long
ago
but
a
little
while
afore
eight
of
the
clock
sithen
i
have
wept
i
know
now
no
good
knight
nor
no
good
man
and
i
know
from
thy
holy
shield
and
from
they
good
name
that
thou
art
a
good
knight
and
i
beseech
ye
therefore
to
help
me
for
ye
be
a
shining
knight
indeed
wherefore
ye
ought
not
to
fail
no
damosel
which
is
in
distress
and
she
besought
you
of
help
mallory
only
half
heard
her
sir
launcelot
was
too
much
with
him
it
was
inconceivable
that
a
knight
of
such
noble
principles
would
even
consider
touching
the
sangraal
to
say
nothing
of
making
off
with
it
maybe
though
his
principles
had
been
quite
as
noble
as
they
had
been
made
out
to
be
he
had
been
queen
guinevere
paramour
he
he
had
lain
with
the
fair
elaine
had
he
when
you
came
right
down
to
it
he
could
very
well
have
been
a
scoundrel
at
heart
all
along
a
scoundrel
whose
true
nature
had
been
toned
down
by
writers
like
malory
and
poets
like
tennyson
all
of
which
while
it
strongly
suggested
that
he
was
capable
of
stealing
the
sangraal
threw
not
the
slightest
light
on
his
reason
for
having
done
so
mallory
was
right
back
where
he
had
started
from
he
turned
to
the
girl
you
said
something
about
needing
my
help
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
instantly
her
tears
stopped
and
she
clasped
her
hands
together
and
looked
at
him
with
worshipful
eyes
oh
fair
sir
ye
be
most
kind
indeed
well
i
wot
from
thy
shining
armor
that
ye
knock
it
off
mallory
said
knock
it
off
i
wot
not
what
never
mind
just
tell
me
what
you
want
me
to
do
ye
must
bear
me
from
the
castle
fair
sir
or
the
king
learns
i
have
bewrayed
my
trust
and
wreaks
his
wrath
upon
me
and
then
ye
must
help
me
regain
the
holy
cup
and
return
it
to
this
chamber
we
worry
about
getting
the
cup
back
after
we
beyond
the
walls
mallory
said
starting
for
the
door
come
on
they
all
in
the
banquet
hall
and
as
drunk
as
lords
they
wo
even
see
us
go
by
she
hung
back
but
the
warders
fair
sir
they
be
not
enchafed
and
king
pelles
by
my
own
wish
did
forbid
them
to
pass
me
mallory
stared
at
her
by
your
own
wish
well
of
all
the
crazy
abruptly
he
dropped
the
subject
all
right
then
how
we
get
out
of
here
there
lieth
beneath
the
fortress
and
the
forest
a
parlous
passage
wherein
dwells
the
fiend
the
which
i
have
much
discomfit
of
but
with
ye
aside
me
fair
knight
there
is
naught
to
fear
mallory
had
read
enough
malory
to
be
able
to
take
fiends
in
his
stride
i
have
to
take
my
horse
along
he
said
is
there
room
for
it
to
pass
yea
fair
sir
the
tale
saith
that
aforetime
many
knights
did
ride
out
beneath
the
fortress
and
the
forest
and
did
smite
the
saxons
saracens
and
pagans
the
which
did
compass
the
castle
about
from
behind
whereupon
the
battle
was
won
mallory
stepped
outside
the
chamber
the
girl
just
behind
him
and
encephalopathed
the
necessary
directions
after
a
moment
easy
money
came
trotting
down
the
corridor
to
his
side
the
girl
gasped
and
to
his
astonishment
threw
her
arms
around
the
rohorse
neck
he
is
a
noble
steed
indeed
fair
sir
she
said
and
worthy
of
a
knight
fitting
to
sit
in
the
siege
perilous
presently
she
stepped
back
frowning
he
he
is
most
cold
fair
sir
all
horses
of
that
breed
are
mallory
explained
incidentally
his
name
is
money
la
such
a
strange
name
not
so
strange
mallory
raised
his
visor
making
a
mental
note
to
see
to
it
that
any
and
all
suits
of
armor
he
might
buy
in
the
future
were
he
got
his
spear
let
be
on
our
way
shall
we
ye
ye
have
blue
eyes
fair
sir
never
mind
the
color
of
my
eyes
let
get
out
of
here
she
seemed
to
make
up
her
mind
about
something
an
ye
will
follow
me
sir
knight
she
said
and
started
down
the
corridor
a
ramp
the
entrance
of
which
was
camouflaged
by
a
rotating
section
of
the
inner
castle
wall
gave
access
to
the
subterranean
passage
the
passage
itself
in
the
flickering
light
of
the
torch
that
the
girl
had
brought
along
appeared
at
first
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
natural
cave
enlarged
through
the
centuries
by
the
stream
that
still
flowed
down
its
center
presently
however
mallory
saw
that
in
certain
places
the
stone
walls
had
been
cut
back
in
such
a
way
that
the
space
on
either
side
of
the
stream
never
narrowed
to
a
width
of
less
than
four
feet
he
saw
other
evidence
of
human
handiwork
too
dungeons
they
were
little
more
than
shallow
caves
now
though
their
iron
gratings
having
rusted
and
fallen
away
after
proceeding
half
a
hundred
yards
he
paused
i
do
know
what
we
walking
for
when
we
got
a
perfectly
good
horse
at
our
disposal
he
told
the
girl
come
on
i
help
you
into
the
saddle
and
i
jump
on
behind
she
shook
her
head
no
fair
knight
it
is
not
fitting
for
a
gentlewoman
to
ride
tofore
her
champion
ye
will
mount
and
i
will
ride
behind
suit
yourself
mallory
said
he
climbed
into
the
saddle
with
a
clank
and
a
clatter
and
helped
her
up
on
easy
money
croup
by
the
way
you
never
did
tell
me
your
name
i
hight
the
damosel
rowena
pleased
to
meet
you
mallory
said
easy
he
encephalopathed
they
rode
in
silence
for
a
little
while
the
light
from
rowena
torch
dancing
acappella
rigadoons
on
bare
walls
and
dripping
ceilings
easy
money
hoofbeats
hardly
audible
above
the
purling
of
the
stream
presently
rowena
said
it
were
best
that
ye
drew
out
thy
sword
fair
sir
for
anon
the
fiend
will
beset
us
he
has
beset
us
yet
mallory
pointed
out
la
fair
sir
he
will
he
saw
no
harm
in
humoring
her
and
did
as
she
had
suggested
you
mentioned
something
a
while
back
about
having
been
given
guardianship
of
the
sangraal
at
your
own
request
he
said
how
did
that
come
about
list
fair
sir
and
i
will
tell
ye
but
first
i
must
tell
ye
of
sir
bors
de
ganis
of
which
sir
lionel
is
brother
it
happed
one
day
that
sir
bors
did
ride
into
a
forest
in
the
kingdom
of
mennes
unto
the
hour
of
midday
and
there
befell
him
a
marvelous
adventure
so
he
met
at
the
departing
of
the
two
ways
two
knights
that
led
lionel
his
brother
all
naked
bounden
upon
a
strong
hackney
and
his
hands
bounden
tofore
his
breast
and
every
each
of
them
held
in
his
hands
thorns
wherewith
they
went
beating
him
so
sore
that
the
blood
trailed
down
more
than
in
an
hundred
places
of
his
body
so
that
he
was
all
blood
tofore
and
behind
but
he
said
never
a
word
as
he
which
was
great
of
heart
he
suffered
all
that
ever
they
did
to
him
as
though
he
had
felt
none
anguish
anon
sir
bors
dressed
him
to
rescue
him
that
was
his
brother
and
so
he
looked
upon
the
other
side
of
him
and
saw
a
knight
which
brought
a
fair
gentlewoman
and
would
have
set
her
in
the
thickest
place
of
the
forest
for
to
have
been
the
more
surer
out
of
the
way
from
them
that
sought
him
and
she
which
was
nothing
assured
cried
with
a
high
voice
mary
succor
your
maid
and
anon
she
espied
where
sir
bors
came
riding
and
when
she
came
nigh
him
she
deemed
him
a
knight
of
the
round
table
whereof
she
hoped
to
have
some
comfort
and
then
she
conjured
him
by
the
faith
that
he
ought
unto
him
in
whose
service
thou
art
entered
in
and
for
the
faith
ye
owe
unto
the
high
order
of
knighthood
and
for
the
noble
king
arthur
sake
that
i
suppose
that
made
thee
knight
that
thou
help
me
and
suffer
me
not
to
be
shamed
of
this
knight
when
just
a
minute
mallory
interrupted
thoroughly
bewildered
and
simultaneously
afflicted
with
an
irrational
sense
of
this
gentlewoman
you
speak
of
would
she
by
any
chance
be
you
wit
ye
well
fair
sir
when
but
if
she
you
why
do
you
use
the
first
person
singular
instead
of
the
third
i
wot
not
what
why
do
you
use
instead
of
when
you
refer
to
yourself
directly
it
would
not
be
fitting
fair
knight
when
bors
heard
her
say
thus
he
had
so
much
sorrow
there
he
nyst
not
what
to
do
for
if
i
let
my
brother
be
in
adventure
he
must
be
slain
and
that
would
i
not
for
all
the
earth
and
if
i
help
not
the
maid
she
is
shamed
for
ever
and
also
she
shall
lose
her
virginity
the
which
she
shall
never
get
again
then
lift
he
up
his
eyes
and
said
weeping
fair
sweet
lord
whose
liege
man
i
am
keep
lionel
my
brother
that
these
knights
slay
him
not
and
for
pity
of
you
and
for
mary
sake
i
shall
succor
this
maid
then
dressed
he
him
unto
the
knight
the
which
had
the
gentlewoman
and
then
hist
mallory
whispered
i
heard
something
for
a
moment
the
light
flared
wildly
as
though
she
had
nearly
dropped
the
torch
wh
whence
came
the
sound
fair
knight
from
the
other
side
of
the
stream
he
peered
into
the
vacillating
shadows
but
saw
nothing
but
the
darker
shadows
of
one
of
the
innumerable
caves
the
sound
he
had
heard
had
brought
to
mind
the
dull
clang
that
metal
makes
when
it
collides
with
stone
and
it
had
been
so
faint
as
to
have
been
barely
audible
above
the
purling
of
the
stream
thinking
back
he
was
not
altogether
certain
that
he
had
heard
it
at
all
my
imagination
getting
the
best
of
me
i
guess
he
said
presently
there
no
one
there
her
warm
breath
penetrated
the
crevices
of
his
gorget
and
fanned
the
back
of
his
neck
ye
ye
ween
not
that
it
could
have
been
the
fiend
prowling
of
course
i
ween
not
relax
and
finish
your
story
but
get
to
the
point
will
you
an
an
it
so
please
and
then
sir
bors
cried
sir
knight
let
your
hand
off
that
maiden
or
ye
be
but
dead
and
then
he
set
down
the
maiden
and
was
armed
at
all
pieces
save
he
lacked
his
spear
then
he
dressed
his
shield
and
drew
out
his
sword
and
bors
smote
him
so
hard
that
it
went
through
his
shield
and
habergeon
on
the
left
shoulder
and
through
great
strength
he
beat
him
down
to
the
earth
and
at
the
pulling
out
of
bors
spear
there
he
swooned
then
came
bors
to
the
maid
and
said
how
seemeth
it
to
you
of
this
knight
ye
be
delivered
at
this
time
now
sir
said
she
i
pray
you
lead
me
there
as
this
knight
had
me
so
shall
i
do
gladly
and
took
the
horse
of
the
wounded
knight
and
set
the
gentlewoman
upon
him
and
so
brought
her
as
she
desired
sir
knight
said
she
ye
have
better
sped
than
ye
weened
for
an
i
had
lost
my
maidenhead
five
hundred
men
should
have
died
for
it
what
knight
was
he
that
had
you
in
the
forest
by
my
faith
said
she
he
is
my
cousin
so
wot
i
never
with
what
engyn
the
fiend
enchafed
him
for
yesterday
he
took
me
from
my
father
privily
for
i
nor
none
of
my
father
men
mistrusted
him
not
and
if
he
had
had
my
maidenhead
he
should
have
died
for
the
sin
and
his
body
shamed
and
dishonored
for
ever
thus
as
this
time
mallory
was
certain
that
he
had
heard
something
the
sound
had
had
much
in
common
with
the
previous
sound
except
that
it
had
suggested
metal
scraping
against
rather
than
colliding
with
stone
directly
across
the
stream
was
another
cave
this
one
shallow
enough
to
permit
the
torchlight
to
penetrate
its
deeper
shadows
and
looking
into
those
shadows
he
caught
a
faint
gleam
of
reflected
light
rowena
must
have
caught
it
too
for
he
heard
her
gasp
behind
him
it
were
best
that
i
thanked
ye
now
for
thy
great
kindness
fair
knight
she
said
for
anon
we
be
no
longer
on
live
nonsense
mallory
said
if
this
fiend
of
yours
is
anywhere
in
the
vicinity
he
probably
more
afraid
of
us
than
we
are
of
him
the
cave
was
behind
them
now
per
peradventure
he
hath
already
had
meat
rowena
said
hopefully
the
tale
saith
that
and
the
fiend
be
filled
he
becomes
aweary
and
besets
not
them
the
which
do
pass
him
by
in
peace
i
keep
my
sword
handy
just
in
case
he
changes
his
mind
mallory
said
meanwhile
get
on
with
your
autobiography
only
for
sake
cut
it
short
will
you
an
it
please
fair
sir
thus
as
the
fair
gentlewoman
stood
talking
with
sir
bors
there
came
twelve
knights
seeking
after
her
and
anon
she
told
them
all
how
bors
had
delivered
her
then
they
made
great
joy
and
besought
him
to
come
to
her
father
a
great
lord
and
he
should
be
right
welcome
truly
said
bors
that
may
not
be
at
this
time
for
i
have
a
great
adventure
to
do
in
this
country
so
he
commended
them
unto
god
and
departed
the
fair
gentlewoman
did
grieve
mickle
to
see
him
leave
and
she
saith
sir
knights
noble
was
the
service
that
brave
knight
did
render
unto
thy
liege
daughter
in
the
saving
of
her
maidenhead
the
which
she
could
never
get
again
for
that
be
none
other
than
his
own
brother
the
which
he
fauted
therefore
noble
must
be
both
his
king
and
his
cause
wherefore
it
be
befitting
that
a
gentlewoman
of
thy
liege
daughter
nature
leave
the
castle
of
her
father
betimes
that
she
may
render
fitting
service
to
her
succor
cause
and
be
worthy
of
his
deed
thus
spake
this
fair
gentlewoman
whereat
she
did
mount
upon
her
palfrey
and
so
departed
her
from
thence
and
did
ride
as
fast
as
her
palfrey
might
bear
her
whereupon
after
many
days
she
came
to
the
castle
of
carbonek
and
did
seek
out
king
pelles
and
did
beseech
him
that
she
might
be
made
guardian
of
the
sangraal
whereat
he
did
graciously
consent
to
her
request
and
did
consent
also
that
she
be
made
prisoner
in
the
fortress
by
her
own
wish
and
now
she
was
bewrayed
her
trust
fair
sir
and
the
table
of
silver
whereon
the
sangraal
stood
stands
empty
for
some
time
after
she
finished
talking
mallory
was
silent
was
she
trying
to
pull
his
leg
he
wondered
or
were
the
gentlewomen
of
her
day
and
age
really
as
and
as
as
she
would
have
him
believe
he
decided
not
to
go
into
the
matter
for
the
moment
tell
me
rowena
he
said
if
the
sangraal
is
visible
only
to
those
who
are
worthy
of
it
as
i
have
been
led
to
believe
how
are
any
of
those
wassailers
whooping
it
up
back
there
in
that
banquet
hall
going
to
know
whether
it
gone
or
not
it
be
ofttimes
averred
that
all
can
not
see
the
holy
cup
as
ye
say
fair
knight
natheless
all
that
have
come
unto
the
chamber
sithen
my
trust
began
they
did
see
it
and
sir
launcelot
the
which
is
much
with
sin
he
did
see
it
and
did
take
it
he
not
going
to
get
very
far
with
it
though
mallory
said
and
then
how
long
is
the
tunnel
anyway
anon
we
shall
see
the
stars
fair
sir
she
was
right
and
a
few
minutes
later
after
rounding
a
turn
in
the
passage
they
emerged
upon
the
bank
of
a
small
river
the
subterranean
stream
that
had
kept
them
company
emerged
too
and
joined
its
larger
sister
on
the
way
to
the
sea
on
either
hand
cliffs
rose
up
and
the
susurrus
of
waves
breaking
on
sand
could
be
heard
in
the
distance
mallory
guided
easy
money
upstream
to
where
the
cliffs
dwindled
down
to
thickly
forested
slopes
it
took
him
but
a
moment
to
orientate
himself
and
presently
rohorse
and
riders
were
headed
in
the
direction
of
the
highway
now
said
he
if
you
tell
me
where
you
want
to
be
dropped
off
i
see
what
i
can
do
about
getting
the
grail
back
there
was
a
brief
silence
then
an
an
ye
wish
ye
may
leave
me
here
he
halted
easy
money
dismounted
and
lifted
her
down
to
the
ground
he
looked
around
expecting
to
see
a
habitation
of
some
sort
he
saw
nothing
but
trees
he
faced
the
girl
again
do
you
have
any
friends
or
relatives
you
can
stay
with
an
argent
shaft
of
moonlight
slanting
down
through
the
foliage
illumined
her
face
there
be
none
nigh
fair
sir
nor
none
nearer
than
an
hundred
miles
i
shall
abide
your
again
coming
here
in
the
forest
mallory
stared
at
her
she
did
look
or
act
either
for
that
matter
as
though
she
knew
enough
to
get
in
out
of
the
rain
abide
here
in
the
forest
why
you
would
last
a
week
but
ye
will
return
hither
with
the
sangraal
long
afore
that
whereupon
we
two
together
shall
return
the
holy
vessel
to
the
chamber
and
i
shall
not
be
made
to
suffer
the
severing
of
my
two
hands
he
was
aghast
they
would
dare
cut
off
your
hands
they
dare
much
fair
knight
know
ye
naught
of
the
customs
of
the
land
he
was
silent
what
in
the
world
was
he
going
to
do
about
her
she
would
probably
wait
here
for
him
until
she
starved
to
death
or
equally
as
distressing
until
she
was
apprehended
abruptly
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
to
the
extent
that
his
pauldrons
permitted
and
remounted
the
rohorse
why
should
it
matter
to
him
what
became
of
her
he
returned
to
the
age
of
chivalry
to
steal
the
sangraal
not
to
play
nursemaid
to
damosels
in
distress
do
take
any
wooden
nickels
now
he
said
two
tiny
stars
appeared
in
the
pale
regions
of
her
eyes
and
twinkled
down
her
cheeks
may
the
good
lord
speed
ye
upon
thy
quest
fair
knight
and
may
he
guard
ye
well
oh
for
pete
sake
mallory
said
and
reaching
down
pulled
her
up
onto
easy
money
croup
i
have
a
castle
not
far
from
here
i
drop
you
off
then
i
go
after
the
sangraal
her
breath
was
warm
little
wind
seeping
through
the
crevices
of
his
gorget
oh
fair
sir
ye
be
the
noblest
of
all
the
knights
in
all
the
land
and
i
shall
serve
thee
faithfully
for
the
rest
of
my
days
the
rohorse
whinnied
easy
mallory
encephalopathed
and
they
started
out
iii
rowena
fell
for
the
hook
line
and
sinker
not
even
the
modern
interior
gave
her
pause
those
objects
which
happened
to
be
beyond
her
ken
and
there
were
many
of
them
she
interpreted
as
appointments
befitting
a
noble
knight
and
as
for
the
rooms
themselves
she
merely
identified
them
with
the
rooms
out
of
her
own
experience
that
they
most
closely
resembled
thus
the
became
the
banquet
hall
the
supply
room
became
the
kitchen
the
control
room
became
the
sorcerer
tower
the
tourist
compartments
became
the
sleeping
tower
mallory
became
the
lord
quarters
the
lavatory
became
the
chapel
and
the
generator
room
became
the
dungeon
only
two
things
disconcerted
her
the
absence
of
servants
and
the
fact
that
easy
money
was
stabled
in
the
banquet
hall
mallory
got
around
the
first
by
telling
her
that
he
had
given
the
servants
a
leave
of
absence
and
she
herself
got
around
the
second
by
declaring
it
to
be
no
more
than
fitting
for
such
a
splendid
steed
to
be
accorded
special
treatment
certainly
mallory
reflected
she
was
nothing
if
she
was
not
after
showing
her
around
he
wasted
no
time
in
getting
down
to
the
business
on
hand
and
stepping
into
the
control
room
he
punched
out
the
data
necessary
to
take
the
back
to
of
the
same
day
and
to
it
one
half
mile
west
of
its
present
position
as
an
overlap
was
bound
to
occur
there
was
a
barely
noticeable
tremor
as
the
transition
took
place
and
simultaneously
the
darkness
showing
on
the
telewindow
transmuted
to
dusk
turning
away
from
the
jump
board
he
saw
rowena
regarding
him
with
large
eyes
from
the
doorway
we
now
back
to
a
point
in
time
that
precedes
the
theft
of
the
sangraal
he
told
her
and
we
relocated
farther
down
the
valley
but
do
let
it
throw
you
none
other
than
merlin
himself
built
the
magic
apparatus
you
see
before
you
in
this
room
and
you
know
yourself
that
once
he
makes
up
his
mind
to
it
merlin
can
do
anything
she
blinked
once
but
evinced
no
other
signs
of
surprise
yea
fair
sir
she
said
i
am
ware
of
the
magic
of
merlin
however
mallory
went
on
magic
such
as
this
is
something
for
a
gentlewoman
such
as
yourself
to
fool
around
with
so
i
must
forbid
you
to
enter
this
room
during
my
absence
from
the
castle
also
while
we
on
the
subject
i
must
also
forbid
you
to
leave
the
castle
during
my
absence
merlin
would
be
upset
no
end
if
there
were
two
damosels
that
hight
rowena
gallivanting
around
the
countryside
at
the
same
time
she
blinked
again
by
my
troth
fair
sir
she
said
i
would
lever
die
than
disobey
thy
two
commands
and
then
have
ye
ate
any
meat
late
this
time
mallory
blinked
meat
it
is
fitting
that
ye
should
eat
meat
afore
ye
ride
out
oh
you
mean
food
i
eat
when
i
get
back
but
there
no
need
for
you
to
wait
he
took
her
into
the
supply
room
and
showed
her
where
the
vacuum
tins
were
stored
you
open
them
like
this
he
explained
pulling
one
out
and
activating
the
desealer
then
as
soon
as
the
contents
cool
off
a
little
you
sit
down
to
dinner
but
this
be
not
meat
she
objected
maybe
not
but
it
a
good
substitute
and
a
lot
better
for
you
a
thought
struck
him
and
he
took
her
into
the
lavatory
and
showed
her
how
to
operate
the
hot
and
dispenser
ascribing
the
setup
to
more
of
merlin
magic
he
debated
on
whether
to
explain
the
function
and
purpose
of
the
adjacent
shower
decided
not
to
there
was
a
limit
to
all
things
and
an
apparatus
for
washing
one
whole
body
was
simply
too
farfetched
for
anyone
living
in
the
to
take
seriously
back
in
the
he
donned
his
helmet
and
gauntlets
reset
the
gauntlet
timepiece
picked
up
his
spear
and
encephalopathed
easy
money
to
his
side
mounting
he
set
the
spear
in
the
stirrup
socket
rowena
gazed
up
at
him
eyes
round
with
awe
and
admiration
and
concern
wit
ye
well
fair
sir
she
said
that
sir
launcelot
the
which
is
thy
father
is
a
knight
of
many
victories
and
therefore
ye
must
take
care
mallory
grinned
dismay
you
not
fair
damsel
i
smite
him
from
his
steed
before
he
can
say
guinevere
he
straightened
his
sword
belt
activated
the
lock
and
rode
across
the
and
entered
the
forest
the
portcullis
closed
behind
him
dusk
had
become
darkness
by
the
time
he
reached
the
highway
approximately
half
an
hour
later
he
would
reach
the
highway
again
however
the
seeming
paradox
did
not
disconcert
him
in
the
least
this
was
far
from
being
the
first
time
he
had
backtracked
himself
on
a
job
illustration
as
before
he
spurned
the
shadows
of
the
bordering
oaks
and
beeches
and
encephalopathed
easy
money
to
keep
to
the
center
of
the
lane
and
as
before
no
one
was
abroad
probably
king
pelles
wassail
was
already
in
progress
or
if
not
the
goodly
knights
and
gentlewomen
were
still
at
evensong
in
any
event
he
reached
the
lane
that
led
to
the
castle
of
carbonek
without
mishap
after
entering
the
lane
he
encephalopathed
easy
money
into
the
concealment
of
the
shadows
of
the
bordering
trees
and
settled
back
in
the
saddle
to
wait
rowena
placing
the
time
of
the
theft
at
a
little
while
afore
eight
of
the
clock
had
been
a
general
estimate
at
best
hence
he
had
allowed
himself
plenty
of
leeway
and
had
arrived
on
the
scene
a
little
early
it
was
well
that
he
had
for
hardly
a
minute
passed
before
he
heard
hoofbeats
approaching
from
the
south
and
presently
he
saw
a
tall
knight
astride
a
resplendent
steed
turn
into
the
lane
his
armor
gleamed
in
the
moonlight
and
bespoke
a
quality
and
class
that
only
a
knight
of
sir
launcelot
status
would
be
able
to
afford
mallory
watched
him
ride
down
the
lane
to
the
entrance
and
heard
him
announce
himself
as
sir
launcelot
the
portcullis
was
raised
without
delay
and
the
knight
rode
through
the
gateway
and
disappeared
from
view
mallory
frowned
in
the
darkness
something
about
the
incident
had
failed
to
jibe
he
thought
back
but
he
could
isolate
nothing
that
in
retrospect
anyway
seemed
in
the
least
incongruous
he
tried
again
with
the
same
result
and
at
length
he
concluded
that
the
note
of
discord
had
originated
in
his
imagination
again
he
settled
back
to
wait
he
was
particularly
worried
about
the
outcome
of
the
forthcoming
encounter
the
superiority
of
the
weapons
and
armor
should
be
more
than
enough
to
see
him
through
but
just
the
same
he
wished
there
was
some
way
to
avoid
it
there
was
of
course
sir
launcelot
theft
of
the
sangraal
was
already
incorporated
in
fact
and
as
a
could
not
be
obviated
by
a
previous
theft
all
mallory
could
do
was
to
make
his
move
after
the
in
the
hope
that
that
was
when
he
made
his
move
a
did
have
nearly
as
much
leeway
as
his
seeming
freedom
of
movement
might
lead
the
uninitiated
to
believe
about
all
he
could
do
was
to
play
along
with
destiny
and
await
his
opportunities
if
destiny
smiled
he
succeeded
if
destiny
frowned
he
did
not
however
mallory
was
optimistic
about
his
forthcoming
bid
for
the
grail
for
if
it
was
in
the
books
for
him
to
wrest
the
cup
from
sir
launcelot
the
chances
were
he
would
have
gotten
as
far
as
he
had
he
estimated
that
it
would
take
the
man
five
minutes
to
enter
the
castle
proceed
to
the
chamber
seize
the
sangraal
return
to
the
courtyard
and
come
riding
back
to
the
portcullis
seven
minutes
proved
to
be
nearer
the
mark
in
response
to
a
hail
from
within
the
wall
several
of
the
warders
bent
to
the
windlass
whereupon
the
portcullis
scraped
and
groaned
aloft
and
the
tall
knight
came
riding
out
just
as
the
hands
of
mallory
timepiece
registered
mallory
let
him
pass
straining
his
eyes
in
vain
for
a
glimpse
of
the
sangraal
he
waited
till
sir
launcelot
was
half
a
hundred
yards
down
the
highway
before
he
encephalopathed
easy
money
to
follow
and
he
waited
till
a
bend
in
the
road
hid
the
castle
of
carbonek
from
view
before
encephalopathing
the
command
to
charge
at
this
point
sir
launcelot
became
aware
that
he
was
no
longer
alone
and
wheeled
his
steed
around
without
an
instant
hesitation
he
dressed
his
spear
and
launched
a
all
mallory
could
think
of
was
a
steam
locomotive
bearing
down
upon
him
he
swallowed
grimly
aventred
his
own
spear
and
upped
easy
pace
two
could
play
at
being
locomotives
the
approaching
knight
and
steed
loomed
larger
the
sound
of
hoofbeats
crescendoed
into
staccato
thunder
the
spear
pointing
straight
toward
mallory
breastplate
had
something
of
the
aspect
of
a
flagpole
hurriedly
he
got
his
shield
into
position
maybe
the
man
would
spot
the
red
cross
realize
its
significance
and
slow
down
if
he
spotted
it
he
gave
no
sign
and
only
came
the
faster
mallory
braced
himself
for
the
forthcoming
impact
however
the
impact
never
occurred
at
the
last
moment
his
antagonist
directed
the
spearpoint
at
mallory
helmet
did
something
that
made
it
separate
itself
from
the
shaft
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
gout
of
incandescence
and
come
streaking
through
the
air
like
a
little
comet
mallory
tried
to
dodge
but
he
would
have
been
equally
as
successful
if
he
had
tried
to
dodge
a
real
comet
there
was
a
deafening
in
the
region
of
his
left
and
the
whole
left
side
of
his
face
went
numb
just
before
he
blacked
out
he
saw
the
oncoming
knight
veer
his
steed
wheel
it
around
and
ride
off
a
peal
of
laughter
drifted
back
over
the
man
shoulder
now
said
the
you
will
try
again
is
for

in

said
the
ow
the
boy
mallory
cried
ow
the
man
mallory
groaned
sitting
up
in
the
weeds
beside
the
early
highway
all
was
silence
around
him
if
you
discounted
the
stridulations
of
insects
and
the
of
frogs
a
few
yards
away
easy
money
stood
immobile
in
the
moonlight
mallory
raised
his
hand
to
his
helmet
and
felt
the
sizable
dent
that
the
spearpoint
had
made
gingerly
he
took
the
helmet
off
who
in
the
world
would
have
dreamed
that
they
had
in
this
day
and
age
the
absurdity
of
the
thought
snapped
him
back
to
full
awareness
a
moment
later
he
remembered
the
peal
of
familiar
laughter
perfidion
the
man
must
have
wanted
the
grail
desperately
to
have
come
after
it
himself
which
meant
that
it
was
probably
worth
much
more
than
he
had
let
on
but
how
had
he
known
when
and
where
to
essay
the
lift
more
specifically
how
had
he
found
out
when
and
where
to
essay
the
lift
on
such
short
notice
mallory
thought
back
he
was
reasonably
certain
that
he
had
made
no
slips
of
the
tongue
during
his
visit
to
the
perfidion
tower
and
during
the
ensuing
game
of
golp
and
he
was
equally
certain
that
he
had
let
fall
no
revealing
references
to
the
he
had
so
carefully
pinpointed
where
then
had
he
gone
astray
suddenly
way
back
in
his
mind
perfidion
said
by
the
way
tom
i
take
it
you
all
set
as
regards
costume
equipment
and
the
like
i
got
the
sweetest
little
suit
of
armor
you
ever
laid
eyes
on
mallory
heard
himself
answer
he
swore
so
that
was
it
all
perfidion
had
needed
to
do
was
to
make
the
rounds
of
the
costumers
who
specialized
in
armor
and
to
shell
out
a
few
kennedees
to
the
one
mallory
had
patronized
last
then
in
possession
of
the
knowledge
that
mallory
was
embarking
into
the
past
as
sir
galahad
all
perfidion
had
had
to
do
was
to
consult
one
of
the
many
experts
he
kept
at
his
beck
and
call
the
expert
had
undoubtedly
told
him
where
sir
galahad
was
supposed
to
have
found
the
grail
before
taking
it
to
sarras
and
equally
as
important
approximately
when
the
event
was
supposed
to
have
taken
place
further
questions
could
not
have
failed
to
elicit
the
additional
information
that
sir
launcelot
had
come
to
the
chamber
of
the
sangraal
before
sir
galahad
had
and
from
this
perfidion
had
undoubtedly
deduced
that
sir
launcelot
could
very
well
have
been
a
in
disguise
too
and
that
the
man
having
arrived
on
the
scene
first
could
very
well
have
been
responsible
for
the
grail
return
to
heaven
despite
what
legend
said
to
the
contrary
certainly
it
had
been
a
gamble
worth
taking
and
obviously
perfidion
had
taken
it
and
won
the
jackpot
but
that
did
mean
he
was
going
to
keep
the
jackpot
not
by
a
long
shot
mallory
encephalopathed
easy
money
to
his
side
and
pulled
himself
to
his
feet
with
the
help
of
the
left
stirrup
and
hung
his
helmet
on
the
pommel
then
he
picked
up
his
spear
and
clambered
into
the
saddle
we
not
beat
yet
easy
money
he
said
easy
money
whinnied
stamped
its
feet
and
started
back
toward
the
a
short
while
later
they
passed
the
lane
that
led
to
the
castle
of
carbonek
presently
mallory
heard
the
of
approaching
hoofbeats
and
not
wanting
to
risk
an
encounter
in
his
weakened
condition
he
the
rohorse
off
the
highway
and
into
the
deep
shadows
of
a
big
oak
there
was
something
tantalizingly
familiar
about
the
horse
and
rider
coming
down
the
highway
small
wonder
the
horse
was
easy
money
and
the
rider
was
himself
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
castle
of
carbonek
to
lift
the
holy
grail
mallory
gazed
after
his
retreating
figure
disgustedly
sucker
he
said
iv
rowena
nearly
threw
a
fit
when
mallory
rode
into
the
oh
fair
knight
ye
be
sorely
wounded
indeed
she
cried
helping
him
down
from
his
rohorse
certes
an
ye
bleed
so
much
ye
may
die
mallory
head
was
throbbing
and
he
saw
two
damosels
that
hight
rowena
instead
of
only
one
i
be
all
right
after
i
lie
down
for
a
while
he
said
and
do
worry
about
the
bleeding
it
almost
stopped
he
took
a
step
in
the
direction
of
his
bedroom
office
staggered
and
would
have
fallen
if
she
had
caught
his
arm
her
strength
astonished
him
for
all
the
lightness
of
his
armor
it
still
lent
him
an
weight
of
some
two
hundred
and
ten
pounds
and
yet
the
shoulder
which
she
provided
for
him
to
lean
on
did
not
give
once
all
the
way
to
his
bedside
she
had
his
pauldrons
breastplate
and
off
in
no
time
flat
his
cuisses
greaves
and
sollerets
followed
the
last
he
remembered
was
lying
there
in
his
under
garments
and
his
vest
with
three
faces
swimming
in
the
misted
sea
of
his
vision
each
of
them
invested
with
the
peculiar
beauty
that
concern
and
concern
alone
can
grant
how

mallory
sat
up
i
want
my
real
he
began
i
have
great
joy
of
thy
swift
recovery
fair
sir
rowena
said
she
was
perched
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
applying
a
cool
and
soothing
ointment
to
his
ear
on
the
table
by
the
bed
lay
a
basin
of
water
and
on
her
lap
lay
a
pink
tube
he
grabbed
the
tube
looked
at
the
label
he
sighed
with
relief
where
did
you
find
it
he
asked
la
fair
sir
when
ye
did
seem
no
longer
on
live
i
did
run
both
toward
and
forward
in
the
castle
seeking
a
magical
salve
whereby
i
might
succor
ye
whereupon
i
did
come
to
a
white
box
in
the
chapel
wherein
lay
many
magical
tubes
of
diverse
colors
and
natures
whereof
i
did
choose
one
and
mallory
was
incredulous
you
chose
a
tube
at
random
he
demanded
good
lord
it
might
have
contained
a
counteragent
that
could
have
killed
me
the
the
letters
thereon
seemed
of
a
magical
nature
fair
knight
and
and
the
color
was
seemly
well
anyway
it
was
the
right
one
he
looked
at
her
could
she
read
he
wondered
he
was
tempted
to
ask
her
but
refrained
for
fear
of
embarrassing
her
in
that
same
white
box
he
said
you
will
find
a
big
bottle
filled
with
round
red
pellets
would
you
get
it
for
me
when
she
returned
with
it
he
took
two
of
the
pills
then
he
laid
his
head
back
on
the
pillow
they
restore
the
blood
i
lost
he
explained
but
in
order
for
them
to
do
the
job
properly
i
got
to
lie
perfectly
still
for
at
least
one
hour
she
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
marry
the
magic
of
merlin
is
marvelous
albeit
not
as
marvelous
as
the
magic
of
joseph
of
arimathea
what
did
he
do
that
was
so
marvelous
the
eyes
were
fixed
full
upon
his
face
ye
wit
naught
of
the
tale
of
the
white
shield
ye
bear
fair
sir
list
and
i
will
tell
ye
it
befell
after
the
passion
of
our
lord
year
that
joseph
of
arimathea
the
gentle
knight
the
which
took
down
our
lord
off
the
holy
cross
at
that
time
departed
from
jerusalem
with
a
great
party
of
his
kindred
with
him
and
so
he
labored
till
that
they
came
to
a
city
that
hight
sarras
and
at
that
same
hour
that
joseph
came
to
sarras
there
was
a
king
that
hight
evelake
that
had
great
war
against
the
saracens
and
in
especially
against
one
saracen
the
which
was
king
evelake
cousin
a
rich
king
and
a
mighty
which
marched
nigh
this
land
and
his
name
was
called
tolleme
la
feintes
so
on
a
day
these
two
met
to
do
battle
then
joseph
the
son
of
joseph
of
arimathea
went
to
king
evelake
and
told
him
he
should
be
discomfit
and
slain
but
if
he
left
his
belief
of
the
old
law
and
believed
upon
the
new
law
and
then
there
he
showed
him
the
right
belief
of
the
holy
trinity
to
the
which
he
agreed
unto
with
all
his
heart
and
there
this
shield
was
made
for
king
evelake
in
the
name
of
him
that
died
upon
the
cross
and
then
hold
it
a
minute
mallory
said
this
shield
you
finally
got
around
to
mentioning
is
it
the
same
one
you
set
out
to
tell
me
about
wit
ye
well
fair
sir
and
then
through
king
evelake
good
belief
he
had
the
better
of
king
tolleme
for
when
evelake
was
in
the
battle
there
was
a
cloth
set
afore
the
shield
and
when
he
was
in
the
greatest
peril
he
left
put
away
the
cloth
and
then
his
enemies
saw
a
figure
of
a
man
on
the
cross
wherethrough
they
all
were
discomfit
and
so
it
befell
that
a
man
of
king
evelake
was
smitten
his
hand
off
and
bare
that
hand
in
his
other
hand
and
joseph
called
that
man
unto
him
and
bade
him
go
with
good
devotion
touch
the
cross
and
as
soon
as
that
man
had
touched
the
cross
with
his
hand
it
was
as
whole
as
ever
it
was
tofore
then
soon
after
there
fell
a
great
marvel
that
the
cross
of
the
shield
at
one
time
vanished
away
that
no
man
wist
where
it
became
and
then
king
evelake
was
baptized
and
for
the
most
part
all
the
people
of
that
city
so
soon
after
joseph
would
depart
and
king
evelake
would
go
with
him
whether
he
would
or
nold
and
so
by
fortune
they
came
into
this
land
that
at
that
time
was
called
great
britain
and
there
they
found
a
great
felon
paynim
that
put
joseph
into
prison
and
so
a
great
mallory
asked
in
one
sense
the
story
was
familiar
to
him
but
what
bothered
him
was
the
fact
that
it
was
familiar
in
another
sense
too
a
sense
he
could
put
his
finger
on
a
wicked
unbeliever
in
our
lord
and
so
by
fortune
tidings
came
unto
a
worthy
man
that
hight
mondrames
and
he
assembled
all
his
people
for
the
great
renown
he
had
heard
of
joseph
and
so
he
came
into
the
land
of
great
britain
and
disinherited
this
felon
paynim
and
consumed
him
and
therewith
delivered
joseph
out
of
prison
and
after
that
all
the
people
were
turned
to
the
christian
faith
not
long
after
that
joseph
was
laid
in
his
deadly
bed
and
when
king
evelake
say
that
he
made
much
sorrow
and
said
for
thy
love
i
have
left
my
country
and
sith
ye
shall
depart
out
of
this
world
leave
me
some
token
of
yours
that
i
may
think
on
you
joseph
said
that
will
i
do
full
gladly
now
bring
me
your
shield
that
i
took
you
when
ye
went
into
battle
against
king
tolleme
then
joseph
bled
at
the
nose
so
that
he
might
not
by
no
means
be
staunched
and
there
upon
that
shield
he
made
a
cross
of
his
own
blood
now
may
ye
see
a
remembrance
that
i
love
you
for
ye
shall
never
see
this
shield
but
ye
shall
think
on
me
and
it
shall
be
always
as
fresh
as
it
is
now
and
never
shall
man
bear
this
shield
about
his
neck
but
he
shall
repent
it
unto
the
time
that
galahad
the
good
knight
bare
it
and
the
last
of
my
lineage
shall
have
it
about
his
neck
that
shall
do
many
marvelous
deeds
now
said
king
evelake
where
shall
i
put
this
shield
that
this
worthy
knight
may
have
it
ye
shall
leave
it
there
as
nacien
the
hermit
shall
be
put
after
his
death
for
thither
shall
that
good
knight
come
the
fifteenth
day
after
that
he
shall
receive
the
order
of
knighthood
and
so
when
mallory
awoke
rowena
head
was
resting
on
his
chest
and
she
was
breathing
the
soft
and
even
breaths
of
untroubled
sleep
her
hair
viewed
thus
closely
was
not
as
dark
as
he
had
at
first
believed
it
to
be
it
was
brown
really
rather
than
and
astonishingly
lustrous
without
thinking
he
rested
his
hand
lightly
upon
her
head
she
stirred
then
and
sat
up
rubbing
her
eyes
for
a
moment
she
stared
at
him
uncomprehendingly
then
prithee
forgive
me
fair
sir
she
said
mallory
sat
up
too
forgive
you
for
what
go
open
a
couple
of
vacuum
tins
while
i
get
into
my
armor
i
going
to
bring
this
caper
to
a
close
thy
thy
strength
has
returned
i
never
felt
better
in
my
life
in
the
he
said
sitting
down
at
the
table
before
one
of
the
two
vacuum
tins
she
had
opened
you
never
did
ask
me
what
happened
ye
will
tell
me
of
thy
own
will
an
ye
wish
me
to
know
mallory
took
a
mouthful
of
simulsteak
chewed
and
swallowed
your
sir
launcelot
turned
out
to
be
a
phony
and
pulled
a
rabbit
out
of
his
helmet
the
nature
of
which
i
better
not
try
to
describe
to
you
eyes
round
as
plums
she
regarded
him
across
the
table
a
a
phony
fair
sir
mallory
nodded
that
a
sort
of
felon
paynim
who
plays
golp
but
with
my
own
eyes
i
did
see
his
armor
fair
knight
that
right
you
saw
his
armor
but
you
did
see
him
a
certain
character
by
the
name
of
perfidion
was
residing
behind
that
hardware
not
the
good
sir
launcelot
perfidion
mallory
grinned
sir
jason
perfidion
a
knight
errant
ye
wit
not
of
but
the
tournament
not
over
yet
and
this
time
got
the
rabbit
he
thinks
i
dead
he
he
left
ye
for
dead
fair
sir
that
he
did
and
if
that
little
of
his
had
struck
just
one
inch
to
the
right
i
have
been
just
that
he
shoved
his
empty
vacuum
tin
away
and
stood
up
excuse
me
a
minute
i
got
to
visit
the
sorcerer
tower
again
in
the
control
room
he
took
the
back
to
of
the
same
day
and
it
half
a
mile
farther
down
the
valley
turning
he
saw
that
rowena
had
followed
him
and
was
watching
him
from
the
doorway
whereabouts
may
i
find
oats
that
i
may
feed
thy
horse
fair
knight
she
asked
easy
money
does
eat
he
mallory
paused
astonished
as
two
of
the
largest
tears
he
had
ever
seen
coalesced
in
her
eyes
and
went
tumbling
down
her
cheeks
oh
it
not
that
he
sick
he
rushed
on
just
that
horses
like
him
do
require
food
to
keep
them
going
why
easy
money
guaranteed
for
he
live
another
thirty
years
the
sun
came
up
beyond
the
horizons
of
her
eyes
it
pleaseth
me
mickle
to
hear
ye
speak
thus
fair
knight
i
i
have
great
joy
of
him
back
in
the
mallory
pulled
on
his
gauntlets
reset
his
timepiece
and
donned
his
helmet
the
left
was
shot
but
otherwise
the
piece
was
in
good
condition
aside
from
the
dent
of
course
he
encephalopathed
easy
money
to
his
side
hung
his
shield
around
his
neck
and
mounted
hand
me
my
spear
will
you
rowena
he
asked
she
did
so
ye
be
a
most
noble
knight
indeed
fair
sir
she
said
for
to
set
so
little
store
by
thine
own
life
in
the
service
of
a
damosel
the
which
is
undeserving
of
thy
deeds
i
i
would
lever
that
ye
forsook
the
sangraal
than
that
ye
be
fordone
her
concern
touched
him
and
he
removed
his
helmet
and
leaned
down
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
keep
the
home
fires
burning
he
said
then
setting
his
helmet
back
in
place
he
activated
the
lock
rode
across
the
and
set
forth
into
the
forest
once
again
v
this
time
when
he
reached
the
crest
of
the
ridge
that
separated
the
two
valleys
mallory
took
an
azimuth
on
the
towers
of
carbonek
the
direction
to
easy
money
and
programmed
the
animal
to
proceed
in
as
straight
a
course
as
possible
in
the
east
the
moon
was
just
beginning
to
rise
in
the
west
traces
of
the
sunset
lingered
just
above
the
horizon
on
the
highway
below
a
knight
sitting
astride
a
brown
rohorse
and
bearing
a
white
shield
with
a
red
cross
in
the
center
was
riding
toward
carbonek
to
challenge
a
century
felon
paynim
in
imitation
armor
in
the
valley
mallory
had
just
left
behind
him
there
were
two
castles
named
and
soon
a
third
would
pop
into
existence
and
yet
another
mallory
come
riding
out
mallory
grinned
it
was
a
little
bit
like
playing
chess
the
forest
which
easy
money
presently
entered
was
parklike
in
places
and
sometimes
the
trees
thinned
out
into
wide
moonlit
meadows
crossing
one
of
the
meadows
mallory
saw
the
first
star
and
when
at
length
easy
money
emerged
on
the
highway
the
heavens
were
decked
out
in
typical
midsummer
panoply
the
rohorse
had
followed
its
programming
almost
perfectly
and
had
emerged
at
a
point
just
south
of
the
lane
leading
to
the
castle
of
carbonek
all
mallory
had
to
do
was
to
it
farther
down
the
highway
to
a
point
beyond
the
site
of
the
forthcoming
joust
while
doing
so
he
kept
well
within
the
concealing
shadows
of
the
bordering
oaks
and
beeches
where
the
ground
was
soft
and
could
give
forth
no
telltale
of
hoofbeats
his
circumspection
proved
wise
as
in
one
sense
of
course
it
already
had
and
when
the
false
sir
launcelot
came
riding
by
on
his
way
to
the
castle
and
the
chamber
of
the
sangraal
he
was
no
more
aware
of
mallory
iii
presence
by
the
roadside
than
he
would
presently
be
aware
of
mallory
ii
presence
in
the
shadows
of
the
trees
that
bordered
the
lane
mallory
iii
grinned
again
and
brought
easy
money
to
a
halt
just
beyond
the
next
bend
wit
ye
well
sir
jason
that
thy
hours
be
numbered
he
said
he
remained
seated
in
the
saddle
feeling
pretty
good
about
the
world
in
no
time
at
all
if
his
ambuscade
came
off
he
would
be
on
his
way
back
to
the
and
thence
to
the
century
and
a
haircut
selling
the
sangraal
without
the
aid
of
a
professional
like
perfidion
would
be
difficult
of
course
but
it
could
be
done
and
once
it
was
done
he
mallory
could
take
his
place
on
street
with
the
best
of
them
and
no
questions
would
be
asked
there
was
to
be
sure
the
problem
of
what
to
do
about
a
certain
damosel
that
hight
rowena
but
he
would
face
that
when
he
came
to
it
maybe
he
could
drop
her
off
a
dozen
years
in
the
future
in
a
region
far
enough
removed
from
carbonek
to
ensure
her
safety
he
would
see
illustration
at
this
point
in
his
reflections
he
was
jolted
into
alertness
by
the
sound
of
approaching
hoofbeats
a
moment
later
he
heard
a
second
set
of
hoofbeats
and
knew
that
mallory
ii
had
made
his
presence
known
presently
both
sets
crescendoed
into
staccato
thunder
as
the
two
knights
came
pounding
toward
each
other
and
not
long
afterward
there
was
a
clank
and
a
clatter
as
mallory
ii
went
tumbling
out
of
his
saddle
and
into
the
roadside
weeds
finally
the
single
set
of
hoofbeats
took
over
again
and
mallory
iii
saw
a
horse
and
rider
coming
around
the
bend
in
the
highway
he
braced
himself
before
making
his
play
he
waited
till
horse
and
rider
were
directly
opposite
him
then
he
encephalopathed
easy
money
to
charge
sir
launcelot
managed
to
get
his
shield
up
in
time
but
the
maneuver
did
him
no
good
mallory
spearhead
struck
the
shield
dead
center
and
sir
launcelot
went
sailing
out
of
his
saddle
to
land
with
an
awesome
clatter
flat
on
his
back
on
the
highway
he
did
not
get
up
dismounting
mallory
removed
the
man
helmet
it
was
perfidion
all
right
there
was
a
large
bruise
on
the
side
of
his
head
and
he
was
out
cold
but
he
was
still
breathing
next
mallory
looked
for
the
sangraal
perfidion
had
concealed
it
somewhere
and
apparently
he
had
done
the
job
well
since
the
armor
could
not
have
accommodated
an
object
of
that
size
the
hiding
place
had
to
be
somewhere
on
the
body
of
his
horse
the
horse
was
standing
quietly
beside
easy
money
in
the
middle
of
the
highway
it
was
and
its
trappings
were
blue
threaded
with
silver
otherwise
the
two
steeds
were
identical
mallory
tumbled
to
the
truth
then
went
over
to
where
the
black
horse
was
standing
raised
its
trappings
found
the
tiny
activator
button
and
depressed
it
the
rose
up
and
there
in
the
secret
compartment
wrapped
in
red
samite
lay
the
cause
of
the
mounting
in
king
arthur
court
always
the
skeptic
mallory
raised
a
corner
of
the
samite
in
order
to
make
certain
that
he
was
not
being
cheated
instantly
a
reflected
ray
of
moonlight
stabbed
upward
into
his
eyes
and
for
a
moment
he
was
blinded
exorcising
the
thought
that
sneaked
into
his
mind
he
closed
the
rearranged
the
trappings
and
returned
to
side
dragging
the
man
over
to
the
black
rohorse
and
slinging
him
over
the
saddle
was
no
easy
matter
but
mallory
managed
then
he
picked
up
perfidion
helmet
and
spear
and
set
the
former
on
the
pommel
and
wedged
the
latter
in
one
of
the
stirrups
finally
he
mounted
easy
money
and
encephalopathing
the
black
rohorse
to
follow
set
out
down
the
highway
away
from
the
castle
of
carbonek
castles
could
fool
the
hadbeens
but
they
could
fool
a
professional
he
spotted
the
phony
towers
of
perfidion
tsb
rising
above
the
trees
before
he
had
proceeded
half
a
mile
after
raising
the
portcullis
he
got
the
man
down
from
the
black
rohorse
dragged
him
inside
and
propped
him
against
the
bar
then
he
got
the
man
helmet
and
spear
and
laid
them
beside
him
after
considerable
reflection
he
went
into
the
control
room
set
the
for
june
the
for
a
busy
intersection
in
downtown
los
angeles
and
punched
out
on
the
lumillusion
panel
satisfied
he
went
into
the
generator
room
and
the
automatic
unit
so
that
when
rematerialization
took
place
the
generator
would
burn
up
finding
a
ball
of
twine
he
returned
to
the
control
room
tied
one
end
to
the
master
switch
and
began
backing
out
of
the
tsb
unwinding
the
twine
as
he
went
in
the
he
paused
and
grinned
down
at
the
perfidion
it
a
better
break
than
you
meant
to
give
me
jason
he
said
and
do
worry
once
you
explain
to
the
authorities
what
you
doing
in
a
suit
of
armor
and
how
you
happened
to
open
a
giant
stand
in
the
middle
of
a
crossroads
you
be
all
right
as
a
matter
of
fact
with
your
knowledge
of
things
to
come
you
probably
wind
up
a
richer
man
than
you
are
now
if
the
smog
does
get
you
first
he
stepped
through
the
lock
jerked
the
twine
and
the
castle
vanished
into
thin
air
remounting
easy
money
and
encephalopathing
the
black
rohorse
to
follow
he
started
back
toward
the
taking
a
direct
route
through
the
forest
he
was
halfway
to
his
destination
and
had
just
emerged
into
a
wide
meadow
when
he
saw
the
knight
with
the
white
shield
riding
toward
him
in
the
bright
moonlight
in
the
center
of
the
shield
there
was
a
vivid
cross
when
the
knight
saw
mallory
he
brought
his
steed
to
a
halt
moonlight
glimmered
eerily
on
his
shield
turned
his
helmet
to
silver
his
armor
seemed
to
emit
an
unearthly
light
a
light
that
was
at
once
terrifying
and
transcendent
the
hilt
of
his
sword
was
as
as
the
cross
on
his
shield
so
was
the
pommel
of
his
spear
here
was
righteousness
incarnate
here
in
the
form
of
an
armored
man
on
horseback
was
the
quintessence
of
the
age
of
chivalry
not
the
age
of
chivalry
as
exemplified
by
the
vain
and
boasting
nobles
who
had
constituted
of
the
profession
and
who
had
used
the
quest
of
the
holy
grail
as
an
excuse
to
seek
after
mead
and
maidens
but
the
age
of
chivalry
as
it
might
have
been
if
the
ideal
behind
it
had
been
shared
by
the
many
instead
of
by
the
few
the
age
of
chivalry
in
short
as
it
had
come
down
to
posterity
through
the
pages
of
malory
morte
at
length
the
knight
spoke
i
hight
sir
galahad
of
the
table
round
reluctantly
mallory
encephalopathed
his
two
rohorses
to
halt
and
said
the
only
thing
he
had
left
to
say
i
hight
sir
thomas
of
the
castle
by
whose
leave
bear
ye
likenesses
of
the
red
arms
and
the
white
shield
whereon
shines
the
red
cross
the
which
was
put
there
by
joseph
of
arimathea
whilst
he
lay
dying
in
his
deadly
bed
mallory
did
not
answer
there
was
silence
then
i
would
joust
with
ye
sir
galahad
said
there
it
was
laid
right
on
the
line
the
challenge
the
death
sentence
nonsense
mallory
told
himself
he
nothing
but
a
old
kid
with
your
rohorse
and
your
superior
weapons
you
can
unseat
him
in
two
seconds
flat
and
once
he
down
that
glorified
junk
pile
wearing
will
glue
him
to
the
ground
so
fast
he
wo
be
able
to
lift
a
finger
aloud
he
said
have
at
me
then
instantly
sir
galahad
wheeled
his
horse
around
and
rode
to
the
far
side
of
the
meadow
there
he
wheeled
the
horse
around
again
and
dressed
his
spear
moonlight
danced
a
silvery
saraband
on
his
white
shield
and
the
cross
blurred
and
seemed
to
run
mallory
dressed
his
own
spear
immediately
sir
galahad
charged
speed
ahead
easy
money
mallory
encephalopathed
and
the
rohorse
took
off
like
a
rocket
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
hang
on
tight
and
the
joust
would
be
in
the
bag
he
reassured
himself
sir
galahad
spear
would
break
like
a
matchstick
while
his
own
superior
spear
would
penetrate
sir
shield
as
though
the
shield
was
made
of
tissue
paper
as
in
a
sense
it
really
was
when
you
compared
the
metal
that
constituted
it
to
modern
alloys
no
matter
how
you
looked
at
the
situation
the
kid
was
in
for
a
big
letdown
mallory
almost
felt
sorry
for
him
the
hoofbeats
of
horse
and
rohorse
crescendoed
there
was
the
resounding
clang
of
steel
coming
into
violent
contact
with
steel
mallory
spear
struck
sir
galahad
shield
dead
center
and
snapped
in
two
sir
galahad
spear
struck
mallory
shield
dead
center
and
mallory
sailed
over
easy
money
croup
and
crashed
to
the
ground
he
was
stunned
both
mentally
and
physically
staggering
to
his
feet
he
drew
his
sword
and
raised
his
shield
sir
galahad
had
wheeled
his
horse
around
and
now
he
came
riding
back
several
yards
from
mallory
he
tossed
his
spear
aside
dismounted
as
lightly
as
though
he
wore
no
armor
at
all
drew
his
sword
and
advanced
mallory
stepped
forward
his
confidence
returning
his
spear
had
been
defective
that
was
it
but
his
sword
and
his
shield
were
and
now
that
the
kid
had
elected
to
give
him
a
sporting
chance
he
would
teach
the
young
upstart
a
lesson
that
he
would
never
forget
again
the
two
men
came
together
down
came
sir
galahad
sixth
century
sword
up
went
mallory
century
shield
there
was
an
and
the
shield
parted
down
the
middle
aghast
mallory
stepped
back
sir
galahad
moved
in
sword
upraised
again
mallory
raised
his
own
sword
caught
the
full
force
of
the
terrific
blow
on
the
blade
his
sword
was
cut
cleanly
in
two
his
left
pauldron
was
cleanly
cleaved
and
a
great
numbness
afflicted
his
left
shoulder
he
went
down
he
stayed
down
sir
galahad
leaned
over
him

unholpen
mallory
blacked
out
for
a
moment
and
when
he
came
to
the
shining
knight
was
gone
he
lay
there
in
the
moonlight
for
some
time
looking
up
at
the
stars
at
length
he
fought
his
way
to
his
feet
and
encephalopathed
the
two
rohorses
to
his
side
mounting
easy
money
he
encephalopathed
it
to
return
to
the
westernmost
castle
of
yore
and
encephalopathed
the
other
rohorse
to
follow
he
left
his
broken
weapons
where
they
lay
what
had
gone
out
of
the
world
during
the
last
sixteen
hundred
years
that
had
left
sophisticated
century
steel
inferior
in
quality
to

what
did
sir
galahad
have
that
he

lacked
mallory
shook
his
head
he
did
not
know
the
moonlit
towers
of
the
had
become
visible
through
the
trees
before
it
occurred
to
him
that
before
riding
away
the
man
just
might
have
removed
the
sangraal
from
the
black
rohorse
croup
at
first
thought
such
a
possibility
was
too
absurd
to
be
entertained
but
not
on
second
thought
according
to
morte
the
fellowship
of
sir
galahad
sir
percivale
and
sir
bors
had
taken
both
the
table
of
silver
and
the
sangraal
to
sarras
where
some
time
later
the
sangraal
had
been
borne
up
to
heaven
never
to
be
seen
again
whether
they
had
taken
the
table
of
silver
did
not
concern
mallory
but
what
did
concern
him
was
the
fact
that
if
they
had
taken
the
sangraal
they
could
have
done
so
only
if
it
had
fallen
into
sir
galahad
hands
this
very
night
tomorrow
would
be
too
late
now
was
too
late
in
fact
provided
of
course
that
mallory
was
destined
to
return
with
it
to
the
century
here
then
was
the
crossroads
the
real
moment
of
truth
was
he
destined
to
succeed
or
was
he
hurriedly
he
encephalopathed
the
two
rohorses
to
halt
dismounted
and
raised
the
black
rohorse
trappings
he
was
dizzy
from
the
loss
of
blood
but
he
did
not
let
his
dizziness
dissuade
him
from
his
purpose
and
he
had
the
raised
in
a
matter
of
a
few
seconds
he
held
his
breath
when
he
looked
within
expelled
it
with
relief
the
sangraal
had
not
been
disturbed
he
lifted
it
out
of
the
straightened
its
red
samite
covering
and
cradled
it
in
his
arms
too
weak
to
remount
easy
money
he
encephalopathed
the
two
rohorses
to
follow
and
began
walking
toward
the
rowena
must
have
seen
him
coming
on
one
of
the
telewindows
for
she
had
the
lock
open
when
he
arrived
her
face
went
white
when
she
looked
at
him
and
when
she
saw
the
grail
her
eyes
grew
even
larger
than
plums
he
went
over
and
set
it
gently
down
on
the
table
then
he
collapsed
into
a
nearby
chair
he
had
just
enough
presence
of
mind
left
to
send
her
for
the
bottle
of
pills
and
just
enough
strength
left
to
swallow
several
of
them
when
she
brought
it
then
he
boarded
the
phantom
ship
that
had
mysteriously
appeared
beside
him
and
set
sail
upon
the
soundless
sea
of
night
vi
no
said
the
you
can
not
see
her
she
is
displeased
with
your
score
in
the
race
i
did
my
best
the
boy
mallory
sobbed
but
when
it
came
to
stepping
on
all
those
faces
i
just
could
do
it
the
arranged
its
features
into
a
severe
frown
and
strengthened
its
grip
on
the
boy
mallory
arm
you
knew
that
they
were
only
painted
on
the
game
floor
to
symbolize
the
competitive
spirit
it
said
why
could
you
step
on
them
the
boy
mallory
made
a
final
desperate
effort
to
gain
the
bedroom
door
which
his
mother
had
just
slammed
and
before
which
the
stood
then
he
sank
defeated
to
the
floor
i
do
know
why
i
just
could
that
all
he
sobbed
he
raised
his
voice
but
i
step
on
them
i
step
on
real
faces
too
just
you
wait
and
see
be
a
bigger
than
my
father
ever
dreamed
of
being
i
show
her
i
show
her
the
man
mallory
murmured
just
you
wait
and
see
he
opened
his
eyes
save
for
himself
the
was
empty
rowena
no
answer
he
raised
his
voice
rowena
again
no
answer
he
frowned
the
door
to
the
was
open
and
the
castle
certainly
was
so
large
that
his
voice
could
carry
from
one
end
of
it
to
the
other
his
shoulder
throbbed
faintly
but
otherwise
he
was
unaware
of
his
wound
rowena
had
bound
it
neatly
it
was
said
that
gentlewomen
were
quite
proficient
in
such
matters
and
apparently
she
had
once
again
got
hold
of
the
right
counteragent
he
sat
up
and
swung
his
feet
to
the
floor
so
far
so
good
tentatively
he
stood
up
a
wave
of
vertigo
broke
over
him
after
it
passed
he
was
as
good
as
new
the
pills
had
done
their
work
well
nevertheless
everything
was
not
as
it
should
be
something
was
very
definitely
wrong
rowena
he
called
again
still
no
answer
she
had
removed
his
armor
and
piled
it
neatly
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
he
stared
at
the
various
pieces
trying
desperately
to
think
something
had
awakened
him
that
was
it
the
slamming
of
a
door
or
a
lock
he
look
a
deep
breath
he
smelled
green
things
dampness
a
forest
at
eventide
he
knew
then
what
was
wrong
the
lock
of
the
had
been
opened
and
had
been
left
open
long
enough
for
the
evening
air
to
permeate
the
interior
of
the
tsb
long
enough
in
other
words
to
have
permitted
someone
to
ride
across
the
imaginary
drawbridge
that
spanned
the
afterward
the
lock
had
slammed
back
into
place
of
its
own
accord
he
hurried
into
the
easy
money
stood
all
alone
behind
the
the
black
rohorse
was
gone
his
eyes
leaped
to
the
table
the
sangraal
was
gone
too
he
groaned
the
little
idiot
was
taking
it
back
and
after
he
had
forbidden
her
to
leave
the
castle
too
well
no
he
had
forbidden
her
exactly
he
had
forbidden
her
to
leave
it
his
he
walked
over
to
the
telewindow
nearest
the
lock
and
scrutinized
the
screen
she
was
nowhere
in
sight
but
night
was
on
hand
and
the
range
of
his
vision
while
considerably
abetted
by
the
light
of
the
rising
moon
was
limited
to
the
nearer
trees
presently
he
frowned
was
it
still
the
same
night
or
had
he
been
unconscious
for
almost
hours
it
be
the
same
night
the
position
of
the
moon
disproved
that
and
yet
he
could
swear
that
he
had
been
unconscious
for
no
more
than
a
few
hours
belatedly
he
remembered
his
gauntlet
timepiece
and
returned
to
the
the
timepiece
registered
but
that
did
make
any
sense
either
the
moon
was
still
low
in
the
sky
he
knew
then
that
there
could
be
but
one
answer
and
he
headed
for
the
control
room
posthaste
sure
enough
the
had
been
set
for
of
the
same
day
he
looked
at
the
that
had
been
set
to
the
one
half
mile
farther
west
he
wiped
his
forehead
good
lord
she
might
have
sent
the
tsb
all
the
way
back
to
the
age
of
reptiles
even
worse
she
might
have
plunked
it
right
down
in
the
middle
of
wwiii
she
had
though
in
point
of
fact
she
had
done
exactly
what
she
had
set
out
to
do
taken
the
back
to
a
point
in
time
from
which
the
sangraal
could
be
returned
to
the
castle
of
carbonek
less
than
an
hour
after
it
had
been
stolen
suddenly
he
remembered
how
she
had
watched
him
from
the
doorway
of
the
control
room
each
time
he
had
reset
the
time
and
technologically
speaking
she
was
little
more
than
a
child
but
were
as
uncomplicated
as
modern
technology
could
make
them
and
a
person
needed
to
be
but
little
more
than
a
child
to
operate
them
grimly
mallory
returned
to
his
and
got
into
his
armor
then
ignoring
the
throbbing
of
his
reawakened
wound
he
mounted
easy
money
and
set
out
he
had
no
weapons
but
it
could
not
be
helped
with
a
little
luck
he
would
have
need
of
none
he
was
about
due
for
a
little
luck
if
you
asked
him
he
gambled
that
rowena
would
use
the
same
route
back
to
the
chamber
of
the
sangraal
that
they
had
used
in
leaving
it
actually
she
had
no
other
choice
and
he
easy
money
at
a
fast
trot
in
the
direction
of
the
river
in
the
hope
of
overtaking
her
before
she
reached
the
entrance
to
the
subterranean
passage
however
the
hope
did
not
materialize
and
he
saw
no
sign
of
her
till
he
reached
the
entrance
himself
strictly
speaking
he
saw
no
sign
of
her
then
either
but
he
did
discern
several
dislodged
stones
that
could
have
been
thrown
up
by
the
black
rohorse
hoofs
illustration
entering
the
passage
he
frowned
until
that
moment
the
incongruity
of
a
damosel
a
century
rohorse
had
not
struck
him
after
a
moment
though
he
had
to
admit
that
the
incongruity
was
not
as
glaring
as
it
had
at
first
seemed
encephalopathing
was
merely
a
glorified
term
for
thinking
and
rowena
shortly
after
mounting
perfidion
steed
must
have
made
the
discovery
that
she
had
only
to
think
where
she
wanted
to
go
in
order
for
the
rohorse
to
take
her
there
he
had
not
remembered
to
bring
a
light
nor
did
he
need
one
the
rays
of
easy
money
eye
units
were
more
than
sufficient
for
the
task
on
hand
and
overtaking
the
girl
would
have
been
as
easy
as
rolling
off
a
log
if
she
had
been
riding
a
rohorse
too
overtaking
her
was
of
paramount
importance
anyway
he
could
confiscate
the
sangraal
after
she
returned
it
just
as
easily
as
he
could
before
the
odd
part
about
the
whole
thing
was
that
mallory
never
once
thought
of
the
inevitable
overlap
till
he
saw
the
flicker
of
torchlight
up
ahead
an
instant
later
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
woman
voice
and
instinctively
he
easy
money
into
a
nearby
shallow
cave
illustration
the
flickering
light
grew
gradually
brighter
and
presently
hoofbeats
became
audible
the
woman
voice
was
loud
and
clear
now
and
mallory
made
out
her
words
above
the
purling
of
the
underground
stream
and
then
he
set
down
the
maiden
and
was
armed
at
all
pieces
save
he
lacked
his
spear
then
he
dressed
his
shield
and
drew
out
his
sword
and
bors
smote
him
so
hard
that
it
went
through
his
shield
and
habergeon
on
the
left
shoulder
and
through
great
strength
he
beat
him
down
to
the
earth
and
at
the
pulling
of
bors
spear
there
he
swooned
then
came
bors
to
the
maid
and
said
how
seemeth
it
to
you
of
this
knight
ye
be
delivered
at
this
time
now
sir
said
she
i
pray
you
lead
me
there
as
this
knight
had
me
so
shall
i
do
gladly
and
took
the
horse
of
the
wounded
knight
and
set
the
gentlewoman
upon
him
and
so
brought
her
as
she
desired
sir
knight
said
she
ye
have
better
sped
than
ye
weened
for
an
i
had
lost
my
maidenhead
five
hundred
men
should
have
died
for
it
what
knight
was
he
that
had
you
in
the
forest
by
my
faith
said
she
he
is
my
cousin
so
wot
i
never
with
what
engyn
the
fiend
enchafed
him
for
yesterday
he
took
me
from
my
father
privily
for
i
nor
none
of
my
father
men
mistrusted
him
not
and
if
he
had
had
my
maidenhead
he
should
have
died
for
the
sin
and
his
body
shamed
and
dishonored
for
ever
thus
as
at
this
point
the
truth
behind
the
sense
of
that
mallory
had
experienced
the
first
time
he
had
heard
the
tale
hit
him
so
hard
between
the
eyes
that
he
jerked
back
his
head
when
he
did
so
his
helmet
came
into
contact
with
the
cave
wall
and
scraped
against
the
stone
the
rohorse
and
its
two
riders
were
directly
across
the
stream
now
mallory
i
whispered
rowena
i
gasped
it
were
best
that
i
thanked
ye
now
for
thy
great
kindness
fair
knight
she
said
for
anon
we
be
no
longer
on
live
nonsense
mallory
i
said
if
this
fiend
of
yours
is
anywhere
in
the
vicinity
he
probably
more
afraid
of
us
than
we
are
of
him
per
peradventure
he
hath
already
had
meat
rowena
i
said
hopefully
the
tale
saith
that
an
the
fiend
be
filled
he
becomes
aweary
and
besets
not
them
the
which
do
pass
him
by
in
peace
i
keep
my
sword
handy
just
in
case
he
changes
his
mind
mallory
i
said
meanwhile
get
on
with
your
autobiography
only
for
sake
cut
it
short
will
you
an
it
please
fair
sir
thus
as
the
fair
gentlewoman
stood
talking
with
sir
bors
there
came
twelve
knights
seeking
after
her
and
anon
for
a
long
while
after
the
voices
faded
away
mallory
iv
could
not
move
hearing
the
story
the
second
time
and
more
important
hearing
it
from
the
standpoint
of
an
observer
he
had
been
able
to
identify
it
for
what
it
really
was
an
excerpt
from
morte
the
joseph
of
arimathea
bit
had
been
an
excerpt
too
he
realized
now
probably
lifted
word
for
word
from
the
text
it
was
odd
indeed
that
a
damosel
who
presumably
could
read
could
be
on
such
familiar
terms
with
a
book
that
would
not
be
published
for
another
nine
hundred
and
years
but
not
so
odd
if
she
was
a
century
blonde
in
a
damosel
clothing
remembering
perfidion
secretary
mallory
felt
sick
no
there
was
no
noticeable
resemblance
between
her
and
the
damosel
that
hight
rowena
but
the
removal
of
a
girdle
and
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
makeup
not
to
mention
the
application
of
a
brown
and
the
insertion
of
a
pair
of
contact
lenses
could
very
well
have
brought
such
a
resemblance
into
being
and
quite
obviously
had
the
past
police
were
noted
for
their
impersonations
and
most
of
them
had
eidetic
memories
on
easy
mallory
encephalopathed
and
i
have
got
a
little
score
to
when
he
entered
the
chamber
of
the
sangraal
rowena
iv
was
arranging
the
red
samite
cover
around
the
grail
she
jumped
when
she
saw
him
marry
fair
sir
ye
did
startle
me
methinketh
ye
be
asleep
in
thy
castle
knock
it
off
mallory
said
the
masquerade
over
she
regarded
him
with
round
uncomprehending
eyes
he
got
the
impression
that
she
had
been
crying
the
the
masquerade
fair
knight
that
right
the
masquerade
you
no
more
the
damosel
rowena
than
i
the
knight
sir
galahad
she
lowered
her
eyes
to
his
breastplate
i
i
wot
well
ye
be
not
sir
galahad
fair
sir
it
it
happed
that
aforetime
i
did
see
sir
galahad
with
my
own
eyes
and
when
ye
did
unlace
thy
unberere
and
i
did
see
thy
face
i
knew
ye
could
not
be
him
of
which
ye
spake
abruptly
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
him
defiantly
but
i
knew
from
thy
eyes
that
ye
be
most
noble
fair
sir
and
therefore
an
ye
did
pretend
to
be
him
the
which
ye
were
not
ye
did
so
for
noble
cause
and
it
were
not
for
me
to
question
i
said
knock
it
off
mallory
said
but
with
considerable
less
conviction
i
onto
you
do
you
see
you
a
a
a
time
fink
i
wot
not
what
an
agent
of
the
past
police
one
of
those
who
run
around
history
replacing
stolen
goods
and
turning
in
people
like
myself
you
gave
yourself
away
when
you
lifted
that
sir
bors
bit
straight
out
of
morte
and
but
i
did
say
ye
sooth
fair
sir
sir
bors
did
verily
succor
my
maidenhead
i
wot
not
how
there
can
be
two
of
ye
and
two
of
me
and
four
hackneys
when
afore
there
were
but
two
and
i
wot
not
how
by
touching
the
magic
board
in
thy
castle
in
a
certain
fashion
that
i
could
make
the
hour
earlier
and
i
wot
not
how
the
magic
steed
i
did
bestride
brought
me
hither
i
wot
not
none
of
these
matters
fair
sir
i
wot
only
that
the
magic
of
thy
castle
is
marvelous
indeed
for
a
while
mallory
did
say
anything
he
could
in
the
eyes
fixed
full
upon
his
face
truth
shone
and
that
same
truth
had
invested
her
every
word
the
damosel
rowena
despite
all
evidence
to
the
contrary
and
despite
the
glaring
paradox
the
admission
gave
rise
to
was
not
a
phony
never
had
been
a
phony
and
never
would
be
a
phony
she
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
with
the
exception
of
sir
galahad
the
only
completely
honest
person
he
had
known
in
all
his
life
tell
me
he
said
at
length
were
you
afraid
to
come
back
through
that
passage
alone
were
you
afraid
the
fiend
would
get
you
la
fair
sir
i
had
great
fear
but
it
were
not
fitting
that
i
bethought
me
of
myself
at
such
a
time
she
paused
then
what
might
be
thy
true
name
sir
knight
mallory
mallory
said
thomas
mallory
i
have
great
joy
of
thy
acquaintance
sir
thomas
mallory
only
half
heard
her
he
was
looking
at
the
sangraal
no
more
obstacles
stood
between
him
and
his
quest
and
time
was
he
started
to
take
a
step
in
the
direction
of
the
silver
table
his
foot
did
not
leave
the
floor
he
was
acutely
aware
of
rowena
eyes
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
could
almost
feel
them
upon
his
face
it
was
that
they
were
any
different
than
they
had
been
before
it
was
just
that
he
was
suddenly
and
painfully
cognizant
of
the
trust
and
the
admiration
that
shone
in
them
despite
himself
he
had
the
feeling
that
he
was
standing
in
bright
and
blinding
sunlight
again
he
started
to
take
a
step
in
the
direction
of
the
silver
table
again
his
foot
did
not
leave
the
floor
it
was
so
much
the
fact
that
she
did
believe
he
would
take
the
sangraal
that
bothered
him
it
was
the
fact
that
she
could
conceive
of
him
taking
it
she
could
be
convinced
that
black
was
white
perhaps
and
that
white
was
black
and
that
fiends
hung
out
in
empty
caves
and
castles
but
she
could
never
be
convinced
that
a
knight
of
the
qualities
she
imputed
to
mallory
could
perform
a
dishonorable
act
and
there
it
was
laid
right
on
the
line
for
all
the
good
the
grail
was
going
to
do
mallory
it
might
just
as
well
have
been
at
the
bottom
of
the
mindanao
deep
he
sighed
his
gamble
had
paid
off
any
more
than
perfidion
had
the
real
sir
galahad
was
the
one
who
had
inherited
the
grail
after
all
not
the
false
one
the
false
one
grinned
ruefully
well
he
told
the
damosel
rowena
it
been
nice
knowing
you
he
swallowed
for
some
reason
his
throat
felt
tight
i
i
imagine
you
be
all
right
now
to
his
amazement
she
broke
into
tears
oh
sir
thomas
she
cried
in
my
great
haste
to
return
the
sangraal
to
the
chamber
and
to
right
the
grievous
wrong
committed
by
the
untrue
knight
sir
jason
i
did
bewray
my
trust
again
for
when
i
espied
ye
and
me
and
easy
money
in
the
passage
i
did
suffer
a
great
discomfit
and
it
so
happed
that
when
my
steed
did
enter
into
a
cave
that
the
sangraal
came
free
from
my
hands
and
and
mallory
was
staring
at
her
you
it
stepping
over
to
the
silver
table
she
lifted
a
corner
of
the
red
samite
the
dent
was
not
a
deep
one
but
just
the
same
you
did
have
to
look
twice
to
see
it
i
i
nyst
not
what
to
do
she
said
suddenly
mallory
remembered
the
first
sound
he
had
heard
in
the
passage
when
he
and
rowena
were
leaving
the
castle
of
carbonek
well
how
do
you
like
that
he
said
he
grinned
i
take
it
that
this
puts
your
hands
in
jeopardy
all
over
again
right
yea
sir
thomas
but
i
would
lever
die
than
beseech
thee
again
to
which
mallory
continued
happily
makes
it
out
of
the
question
for
a
knight
such
as
myself
to
leave
you
behind
he
took
her
arm
come
on
he
said
i
do
know
how
i
going
to
fit
a
damosel
into
century
society
but
believe
me
i
going
to
try
and
and
will
ye
take
easy
money
to
this
land
whereof
ye
speak
sir
thomas
sir
thomas
grinned
wit
ye
well
he
said
and
his
buddy
too
come
on
in
the
he
tossed
his
helmet
and
gauntlets
into
a
corner
of
the
and
proceeded
straight
to
the
control
room
there
with
rowena
standing
at
his
elbow
he
set
the
for
june
and
the
for
the
kansas
city
port
lord
it
would
be
good
to
get
home
again
and
get
a
haircut
here
goes
he
told
rowena
and
threw
the
switch
there
was
a
faint
tremor
brace
yourself
rowena
he
said
and
took
her
over
to
the
telewindow
illustration
together
they
gazed
upon
the
screen
mallory
gasped
the
vista
of
spiral
suburban
dwellings
which
he
had
been
expecting
was
not
in
the
offing
in
its
stead
was
a
green
countryside
in
the
distance
a
castle
was
clearly
discernible
he
stared
at
it
it
was
a
job
like
carbonek
it
was
much
more
modern
but
it
was
still
a
castle
obviously
the
had
malfunctioned
and
thrown
the
only
a
little
ways
into
the
future
the
while
leaving
it
in
pretty
much
the
same
locale
he
returned
to
the
to
find
out
just
as
he
reached
it
its
lights
flickered
and
went
out
the
time
and
however
remained
illumined
long
enough
for
him
to
see
when
and
where
the
tsb
had
the
year
was
the
locale
warwickshire
mallory
made
tracks
for
the
generator
room
the
generator
was
smoking
and
the
room
reeked
with
the
stench
of
shorted
wires
he
swore
perfidion
so
that
was
why
the
man
had
broken
with
tradition
and
invited
a
common
to
a
game
of
golp
if
he
had
been
anyone
but
perfidion
he
would
have
gimmicked
the
controls
of
the
so
that
mallory
would
have
wound
up
directly
in
the
fifteenth
century
sans
sojourn
in
the
sixth
but
being
perfidion
he
had
wanted
mallory
to
know
how
completely
he
was
being
outsmarted
the
chances
were
though
that
if
the
man
had
anticipated
the
of
the
two
visits
to
the
chamber
of
the
sangraal
he
would
have
seen
to
it
that
mallory
had
never
gotten
a
chance
to
use
his
sir
galahad
suit
returning
to
the
control
room
mallory
saw
that
the
lumillusion
panel
had
been
to
materialize
the
as
a
english
castle
apparently
it
had
been
in
the
books
all
along
for
him
to
become
a
knight
just
as
it
had
been
in
the
books
all
along
for
perfidion
to
become
the
proprietor
of
a
misplaced
stand
mallory
laughed
he
had
gotten
the
best
of
the
bargain
after
all
at
least
there
was
no
smog
in
the
fifteenth
century
who
was
he
supposed
to
be
he
wondered
had
his
name
gone
down
in
history
by
any
chance
abruptly
he
gasped
was
the
sir
thomas
malory
with
estates
in
northampshire
and
warwickshire
was
the
sir
thomas
malory
who
had
compiled
and
translated
and
written
morte
almost
nothing
about
the
man
life
was
known
and
probably
the
little
that
was
known
had
been
assumed
he
have
popped
up
from
nowhere
made
his
fortune
through
foreknowledge
and
been
knighted
he
have
been
a
reformed
stranded
in
the
fifteenth
century
but
if
he
mallory
was
malory
how
in
the
world
was
he
going
to
get
five
hundred
chapters
of
data
together
and
pass
them
off
as
morte
suddenly
he
understood
everything
going
over
to
where
rowena
was
still
standing
in
front
of
the
telewindow
he
said
i
bet
you
know
no
end
of
stories
about
the
doings
of
the
knights
of
the
table
round
la
sir
thomas
ever
i
saw
day
of
my
life
i
have
heard
naught
else
in
the
court
of
my
father
tell
me
mallory
said
how
did
this
round
table
business
begin
or
better
yet
how
did
the
grail
business
begin
we
can
take
up
the
round
table
business
later
on
she
thought
for
a
moment
then
list
fair
sir
and
i
will
say
ye
at
the
vigil
of
pentecost
when
all
the
fellowship
of
the
round
table
were
come
unto
camelot
and
there
heard
their
service
and
the
tables
were
set
ready
to
the
meat
right
so
entered
into
the
hall
a
full
fair
gentlewoman
on
horseback
that
had
ridden
full
fast
for
her
horse
was
all
besweated
then
she
there
alit
and
came
before
the
king
and
saluted
him
and
he
said
damosel
god
thee
bless
sir
said
she
for
god
sake
say
me
where
sir
launcelot
is
yonder
ye
may
see
him
said
the
king
then
she
went
unto
launcelot
and
said
sir
launcelot
i
salute
you
on
king
pelles
behalf
and
i
require
you
to
come
on
with
me
hereby
into
a
forest
then
sir
launcelot
asked
her
with
whom
she
dwelled
i
dwell
said
she
with
king
pelles
what
will
ye
with
me
said
launcelot
ye
shall
know
said
she
when
ye
that
do
for
now
mallory
interrupted
we
come
back
to
it
as
soon
as
i
get
stocked
up
on
paper
and
ink
scheherazade
he
added
scheherazade
sir
thomas
i
wot
not
he
leaned
down
and
kissed
her
there
no
need
for
you
to
wot
he
said
probably
he
reflected
he
would
have
to
do
a
certain
amount
of
research
in
order
to
record
the
happenings
that
had
ensued
his
and
rowena
departure
and
undoubtedly
said
research
would
result
ironically
in
the
recording
of
the
true
visits
of
sirs
galahad
and
launcelot
to
the
chamber
of
the
sangraal
the
on
which
he
and
perfidion
had
gambled
and
lost
their
shirts
the
main
body
of
the
work
however
had
been
deposited
virtually
on
his
lap
and
its
style
and
flavor
had
been
arbitrarily
determined
moreover
contrary
to
what
history
would
later
maintain
the
job
would
not
be
done
in
prison
but
right
here
in
the
castle
of
yore
with
rowena
sitting
and
dictating
beside
him
as
for
the
impossibility
of
giving
a
damosel
as
his
major
source
that
could
be
avoided
as
in
one
sense
it
already
had
been
my
making
frequent
allusions
to
imaginary
french
sources
and
as
for
the
main
obstacle
to
the
endeavor
his
century
cynicism
that
had
been
obviated
during
his
encounter
with
sir
galahad
the
book
would
be
published
till
but
just
the
same
he
was
keen
to
get
started
on
it
writing
it
should
be
fun
which
reminded
him
i
know
we
have
known
each
other
very
long
in
one
sense
rowena
he
said
but
in
another
we
known
each
other
for
almost
nine
hundred
years
will
you
marry
me
she
blinked
once
then
her
eyes
showed
how
truly
blue
they
could
become
and
she
threw
her
arms
around
his
gorget
wit
ye
well
sir
thomas
said
she
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
but
i
would
lever
do
than
be
thy
bride
did
the
prose
epic
known
successively
as
la
mort
the
most
ancient
and
famous
history
of
the
renowned
prince
arthur
king
of
britaine
as
also
all
the
noble
acts
and
heroicke
deeds
of

valiant
knights
