the
country
doctor
by
honore
de
balzac
translated
by
ellen
marriage
and
clara
bell
for
a
wounded
heart
shadow
and
to
my
mother
introduction
in
hardly
any
of
his
books
with
the
possible
exception
of
does
balzac
seem
to
have
taken
a
greater
interest
than
in
medecin
de
and
the
fact
of
this
interest
together
with
the
merit
and
intensity
of
the
book
in
each
case
is
let
it
be
repeated
a
valid
argument
against
those
who
would
have
it
that
there
was
something
essentially
sinister
both
in
his
genius
and
his
character
medecin
de
was
an
early
book
it
was
published
in
a
date
of
which
there
is
an
interesting
mark
in
the
selection
of
the
name
evelina
the
name
of
madame
hanska
whom
balzac
had
just
met
for
the
lost
jansenist
love
of
benassis
and
it
had
been
on
the
stocks
for
a
considerable
time
it
is
also
noteworthy
as
lying
almost
entirely
outside
the
general
scheme
of
the
as
far
as
personages
go
its
chief
characters
in
the
remarkable
if
not
absolutely
impeccable
of
mm
cerfberr
and
christophe
they
have
a
rare
thing
with
them
missed
agathe
the
forsaken
mistress
have
no
references
appended
to
their
articles
except
to
the
book
itself
and
i
can
not
remember
that
any
of
the
more
generally
pervading
of
the
comedy
makes
even
an
incidental
appearance
here
the
book
is
as
isolated
as
its
scene
and
subject
i
might
have
added
as
its
own
beauty
which
is
singular
and
unique
nor
wholly
easy
to
give
a
critical
account
of
the
transformation
of
the
desert
into
a
happy
valley
is
in
itself
a
commonplace
of
the
preceding
century
it
may
be
found
several
times
over
in
marmontel
s
as
well
as
in
other
places
the
extreme
minuteness
of
detail
effective
as
it
is
in
the
picture
of
the
house
and
elsewhere
becomes
a
little
tedious
even
for
and
readers
in
reference
to
the
exact
number
of
cartwrights
and
and
so
forth
while
the
modern
reader
pure
and
simple
though
schooled
to
endure
detail
is
schooled
to
endure
it
only
of
the
ugly
the
minor
characters
and
episodes
with
the
exception
of
the
wonderful
story
or
legend
of
napoleon
by
private
goguelat
and
the
private
himself
are
neither
of
the
first
interest
nor
always
carefully
worked
out
la
fosseuse
for
instance
is
a
very
tantalizingly
unfinished
study
of
which
it
is
nearly
certain
that
balzac
must
at
some
time
or
other
have
meant
to
make
much
more
than
he
has
made
genestas
excellent
as
far
as
he
goes
is
not
much
more
than
a
type
and
there
is
nobody
else
in
the
foreground
at
all
except
the
doctor
himself
it
is
however
beyond
all
doubt
in
the
very
subordination
of
these
other
characters
to
benassis
and
in
the
skilful
grouping
of
the
whole
as
background
and
adjunct
to
him
that
the
appeal
of
the
book
as
art
consists
from
that
point
of
view
there
are
grounds
for
regarding
it
as
the
finest
of
the
author
s
work
in
the
simple
style
the
least
indebted
to
ornament
or
to
mere
variety
the
dangerous
expedient
of
a
of
which
the
novelists
were
so
fond
has
never
been
employed
with
more
successful
effect
than
in
the
confession
of
benassis
at
once
the
climax
and
the
centre
of
the
story
and
one
thing
which
strikes
us
immediately
about
this
confession
is
the
universality
of
its
humanity
and
its
strange
freedom
from
merely
national
limitations
to
very
few
french
novelists
to
few
even
of
those
who
are
generally
credited
with
a
much
softer
mould
and
a
much
purer
morality
than
balzac
is
popularly
supposed
to
have
been
able
to
boast
would
inconstancy
to
a
mistress
have
seemed
a
fault
which
could
be
reasonably
punished
which
could
be
even
reasonably
represented
as
having
been
punished
in
fact
by
the
refusal
of
an
honest
girl
s
love
in
the
first
place
nor
would
many
have
conceived
as
possible
or
have
been
able
to
represent
in
lifelike
colors
the
lifelong
penance
which
benassis
imposes
on
himself
the
tragic
end
indeed
is
more
in
their
general
way
but
they
would
seldom
have
known
how
to
lead
up
to
it
in
almost
all
ways
balzac
has
saved
himself
from
the
dangers
incident
to
his
plan
in
this
book
after
a
rather
miraculous
fashion
the
goguelat
myth
may
seem
disconnected
and
he
did
as
a
matter
of
fact
once
publish
it
separately
yet
it
sets
off
in
the
same
sort
of
felicitous
manner
of
which
shakespeare
s
and
others
are
the
capital
examples
in
literature
both
the
slightly
details
of
the
beatification
of
the
valley
and
the
various
minute
sketches
of
places
and
folk
and
the
almost
superhuman
goodness
of
benassis
and
his
intensely
and
piteously
human
suffering
and
remorse
it
is
like
the
red
cloak
in
a
group
it
lights
warms
inspirits
the
whole
picture
and
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
thing
of
all
is
the
way
in
which
balzac
in
this
story
so
full
of
goodness
of
feeling
of
true
religion
for
if
benassis
is
not
an
ostensible
practiser
of
religious
rites
he
avows
his
orthodoxy
in
theory
and
more
than
justifies
it
in
practice
has
almost
entirely
escaped
the
sentimentality
unorthodoxy
of
similar
work
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
the
sentimentality
orthodoxy
of
similar
work
in
the
nineteenth
benassis
no
doubt
plays
providence
in
a
manner
and
with
a
success
which
it
is
rarely
given
to
mortal
man
to
achieve
but
we
do
not
feel
either
the
approach
to
sham
or
the
more
than
approach
to
gush
with
which
similar
handling
on
the
part
of
dickens
too
often
affects
some
of
us
the
sin
and
the
punishment
of
the
doctor
the
thoroughly
human
figures
of
genestas
and
the
rest
save
the
situation
from
this
and
other
drawbacks
we
are
not
in
the
cockaigne
of
perfectibility
where
marmontel
and
godwin
disport
themselves
we
are
in
a
very
practical
place
where
in
barley
are
made
and
you
pay
the
respectable
if
not
lavish
board
of
ten
francs
per
day
for
entertainment
to
man
and
beast
and
yet
explain
as
we
will
there
will
always
remain
something
inexplicable
in
the
appeal
of
such
a
book
as
the
de
this
helps
and
that
and
the
other
we
can
see
what
change
might
have
damaged
the
effect
and
what
have
endangered
it
altogether
we
must
of
course
acknowledge
that
as
it
is
there
are
intrusion
of
saint
simonian
jargon
passages
of
and
of
preaching
but
of
what
in
strictness
produces
the
good
effect
we
can
only
say
one
thing
and
that
is
it
was
the
genius
of
balzac
working
as
it
listed
and
as
it
knew
how
to
work
the
book
was
originally
published
by
mme
delaunay
in
september
in
two
volumes
and
chapters
with
headings
next
year
it
was
republished
in
four
volumes
by
werdet
and
the
last
fifteen
chapters
were
thrown
together
into
four
in
it
reappeared
with
dedication
and
date
but
with
the
divisions
further
reduced
to
seven
being
those
which
here
appear
with
the
addition
of
two
la
fosseuse
and
propos
de
braves
gens
between
a
travers
champs
and
le
napoleon
du
these
two
were
removed
in
when
it
was
published
in
a
single
volume
by
charpentier
in
all
these
issues
the
book
was
independent
it
became
a
scene
de
la
vie
de
campagne
in
and
was
then
admitted
into
the
the
separate
issues
of
goguelat
s
story
referred
to
above
made
their
appearances
first
in
europe
for
june
the
book
form
and
then
with
the
imprint
of
a
sort
of
syndicate
of
publishers
in
george
saintsbury
chapter
i
the
countryside
and
the
man
on
a
lovely
spring
morning
in
the
year
a
man
of
fifty
or
thereabouts
was
wending
his
way
on
horseback
along
the
mountain
road
that
leads
to
a
large
village
near
the
grande
chartreuse
this
village
is
the
market
town
of
a
populous
canton
that
lies
within
the
limits
of
a
valley
of
some
considerable
length
the
melting
of
the
snows
had
filled
the
bed
of
the
torrent
often
dry
that
flows
through
this
valley
which
is
closely
shut
in
between
two
parallel
mountain
barriers
above
which
the
peaks
of
savoy
and
of
dauphine
tower
on
every
side
all
the
scenery
of
the
country
that
lies
between
the
chain
of
the
two
mauriennes
is
very
much
alike
yet
here
in
the
district
through
which
the
stranger
was
traveling
there
are
soft
undulations
of
the
land
and
varying
effects
of
light
which
might
be
sought
for
elsewhere
in
vain
sometimes
the
valley
suddenly
widening
spreads
out
a
soft
carpet
of
grass
before
the
eyes
a
meadow
constantly
watered
by
the
mountain
streams
that
keep
it
fresh
and
green
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
sometimes
a
sawmill
appears
in
a
picturesque
position
with
its
stacks
of
long
pine
trunks
with
the
bark
peeled
off
and
its
mill
stream
brought
from
the
bed
of
the
torrent
in
great
square
wooden
pipes
with
masses
of
dripping
filament
issuing
from
every
crack
little
cottages
scattered
here
and
there
with
their
gardens
full
of
blossoming
fruit
trees
call
up
the
ideas
that
are
aroused
by
the
sight
of
industrious
poverty
while
the
thought
of
ease
secured
after
long
years
of
toil
is
suggested
by
some
larger
houses
farther
on
with
their
red
roofs
of
flat
round
tiles
shaped
like
the
scales
of
a
fish
there
is
no
door
moreover
that
does
not
duly
exhibit
a
basket
in
which
the
cheeses
are
hung
up
to
dry
every
roadside
and
every
croft
is
adorned
with
vines
which
here
as
in
italy
they
train
to
grow
about
dwarf
elm
trees
whose
leaves
are
stripped
off
to
feed
the
cattle
nature
in
her
caprice
has
brought
the
sloping
hills
on
either
side
so
near
together
in
some
places
that
there
is
no
room
for
fields
or
buildings
or
peasants
huts
nothing
lies
between
them
but
the
torrent
roaring
over
its
waterfalls
between
two
lofty
walls
of
granite
that
rise
above
it
their
sides
covered
with
the
leafage
of
tall
beeches
and
dark
fir
trees
to
the
height
of
a
hundred
feet
the
trees
with
their
different
kinds
of
foliage
rise
up
straight
and
tall
fantastically
colored
by
patches
of
lichen
forming
magnificent
colonnades
with
a
line
of
straggling
hedgerow
of
guelder
rose
briar
rose
box
and
arbutus
above
and
below
the
roadway
at
their
feet
the
subtle
perfume
of
this
undergrowth
was
mingled
just
then
with
scents
from
the
wild
mountain
region
and
with
the
aromatic
fragrance
of
young
larch
shoots
budding
poplars
and
resinous
pines
here
and
there
a
wreath
of
mist
about
the
heights
sometimes
hid
and
sometimes
gave
glimpses
of
the
gray
crags
that
seemed
as
dim
and
vague
as
the
soft
flecks
of
cloud
dispersed
among
them
the
whole
face
of
the
country
changed
every
moment
with
the
changing
light
in
the
sky
the
hues
of
the
mountains
the
soft
shades
of
their
lower
slopes
the
very
shape
of
the
valleys
seemed
to
vary
continually
a
ray
of
sunlight
through
the
a
clear
space
made
by
nature
in
the
woods
or
a
landslip
here
and
there
coming
as
a
surprise
to
make
a
contrast
in
the
foreground
made
up
an
endless
series
of
pictures
delightful
to
see
amid
the
silence
at
the
time
of
year
when
all
things
grow
young
and
when
the
sun
fills
a
cloudless
heaven
with
a
blaze
of
light
in
short
it
was
a
fair
land
it
was
the
land
of
france
the
traveler
was
a
tall
man
dressed
from
head
to
foot
in
a
suit
of
blue
cloth
which
must
have
been
brushed
just
as
carefully
every
morning
as
the
glossy
coat
of
his
horse
he
held
himself
firm
and
erect
in
the
saddle
like
an
old
cavalry
officer
even
if
his
black
cravat
and
doeskin
gloves
the
pistols
that
filled
his
holsters
and
the
valise
securely
fastened
to
the
crupper
behind
him
had
not
combined
to
mark
him
out
as
a
soldier
the
air
of
unconcern
that
sat
on
his
face
his
regular
features
scarred
though
they
were
with
the
smallpox
his
determined
manner
expression
and
the
way
he
held
his
head
all
revealed
the
habits
acquired
through
military
discipline
of
which
a
soldier
can
never
quite
divest
himself
even
after
he
has
retired
from
service
into
private
life
any
other
traveler
would
have
been
filled
with
wonder
at
the
loveliness
of
this
alpine
region
which
grows
so
bright
and
smiling
as
it
becomes
merged
in
the
great
valley
systems
of
southern
france
but
the
officer
who
no
doubt
had
previously
traversed
a
country
across
which
the
french
armies
had
been
drafted
in
the
course
of
napoleon
s
wars
enjoyed
the
view
before
him
without
appearing
to
be
surprised
by
the
many
changes
that
swept
across
it
it
would
seem
that
napoleon
has
extinguished
in
his
soldiers
the
sensation
of
wonder
for
an
impassive
face
is
a
sure
token
by
which
you
may
know
the
men
who
served
erewhile
under
the
yet
deathless
eagles
of
the
great
emperor
the
traveler
was
in
fact
one
of
those
soldiers
seldom
met
with
nowadays
whom
shot
and
shell
have
respected
although
they
have
borne
their
part
on
every
battlefield
where
napoleon
commanded
there
had
been
nothing
unusual
in
his
life
he
had
fought
valiantly
in
the
ranks
as
a
simple
and
loyal
soldier
doing
his
duty
as
faithfully
by
night
as
by
day
and
whether
in
or
out
of
his
officer
s
sight
he
had
never
dealt
a
sabre
stroke
in
vain
and
was
incapable
of
giving
one
too
many
if
he
wore
at
his
buttonhole
the
rosette
of
an
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
it
was
because
the
unanimous
voice
of
his
regiment
had
singled
him
out
as
the
man
who
best
deserved
to
receive
it
after
the
battle
of
borodino
he
belonged
to
that
small
minority
of
undemonstrative
retiring
natures
who
are
always
at
peace
with
themselves
and
who
are
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
humiliation
at
the
mere
thought
of
making
a
request
no
matter
what
its
nature
may
be
so
promotion
had
come
to
him
tardily
and
by
virtue
of
the
laws
of
seniority
he
had
been
made
a
in
but
it
was
not
until
that
he
became
a
major
in
spite
of
the
grayness
of
his
moustaches
his
life
had
been
so
blameless
that
no
man
in
the
army
not
even
the
general
himself
could
approach
him
without
an
involuntary
feeling
of
respect
it
is
possible
that
he
was
not
forgiven
for
this
indisputable
superiority
by
those
who
ranked
above
him
but
on
the
other
hand
there
was
not
one
of
his
men
that
did
not
feel
for
him
something
of
the
affection
of
children
for
a
good
mother
for
them
he
knew
how
to
be
at
once
indulgent
and
severe
he
himself
had
also
once
served
in
the
ranks
and
knew
the
sorry
joys
and
hardships
of
the
soldier
s
lot
he
knew
the
errors
that
may
be
passed
over
and
the
faults
that
must
be
punished
in
his
men
his
children
as
he
always
called
them
and
when
on
campaign
he
readily
gave
them
leave
to
forage
for
provision
for
man
and
horse
among
the
wealthier
classes
his
own
personal
history
lay
buried
beneath
the
deepest
reserve
like
almost
every
military
man
in
europe
he
had
only
seen
the
world
through
cannon
smoke
or
in
the
brief
intervals
of
peace
that
occurred
so
seldom
during
the
emperor
s
continual
wars
with
the
rest
of
europe
had
he
or
had
he
not
thought
of
marriage
the
question
remained
unsettled
although
no
one
doubted
that
commandant
genestas
had
made
conquests
during
his
sojourn
in
town
after
town
and
country
after
country
where
he
had
taken
part
in
the
festivities
given
and
received
by
the
officers
yet
no
one
knew
this
for
a
certainty
there
was
no
prudery
about
him
he
would
not
decline
to
join
a
pleasure
party
he
in
no
way
offended
against
military
standards
but
when
questioned
as
to
his
affairs
of
the
heart
he
either
kept
silence
or
answered
with
a
jest
to
the
words
how
are
you
commandant
addressed
to
him
by
an
officer
over
the
wine
his
reply
was
pass
the
bottle
pierre
joseph
genestas
was
an
unostentatious
kind
of
bayard
there
was
nothing
romantic
nor
picturesque
about
him
he
was
too
thoroughly
commonplace
his
ways
of
living
were
those
of
a
man
although
he
had
nothing
beside
his
pay
and
his
pension
was
all
that
he
had
to
look
to
in
the
future
the
major
always
kept
two
years
pay
untouched
and
never
spent
his
allowances
like
some
shrewd
old
men
of
business
with
whom
cautious
prudence
has
almost
become
a
mania
he
was
so
little
of
a
gambler
that
if
when
in
company
some
one
was
wanted
to
cut
in
or
to
take
a
bet
at
ecarte
he
usually
fixed
his
eyes
on
his
boots
but
though
he
did
not
allow
himself
any
extravagances
he
conformed
in
every
way
to
custom
his
uniforms
lasted
longer
than
those
of
any
other
officer
in
his
regiment
as
a
consequence
of
the
sedulously
careful
habits
that
somewhat
straitened
means
had
so
instilled
into
him
that
they
had
come
to
be
like
a
second
nature
perhaps
he
might
have
been
suspected
of
meannesss
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
fact
that
with
wonderful
disinterestedness
and
all
a
comrade
s
readiness
his
purse
would
be
opened
for
some
harebrained
boy
who
had
ruined
himself
at
cards
or
by
some
other
folly
he
did
a
service
of
this
kind
with
such
thoughtful
tact
that
it
seemed
as
though
he
himself
had
at
one
time
lost
heavy
sums
at
play
he
never
considered
that
he
had
any
right
to
control
the
actions
of
his
debtor
he
never
made
mention
of
the
loan
he
was
the
child
of
his
company
he
was
alone
in
the
world
so
he
had
adopted
the
army
for
his
fatherland
and
the
regiment
for
his
family
very
rarely
therefore
did
any
one
seek
the
motives
underlying
his
praiseworthy
turn
for
thrift
for
it
pleased
others
for
the
most
part
to
set
it
down
to
a
not
unnatural
wish
to
increase
the
amount
of
the
savings
that
were
to
render
his
old
age
comfortable
till
the
eve
of
his
promotion
to
the
rank
of
of
cavalry
it
was
fair
to
suppose
that
it
was
his
ambition
to
retire
in
the
course
of
some
campaign
with
a
colonel
s
epaulettes
and
pension
if
genestas
name
came
up
when
the
officers
gossiped
after
drill
they
were
wont
to
classify
him
among
the
men
who
begin
with
taking
the
prize
at
school
and
who
throughout
the
term
of
their
natural
lives
continue
to
be
punctilious
conscientious
and
passionless
as
good
as
white
bread
and
just
as
insipid
thoughtful
minds
however
regarded
him
very
differently
not
seldom
it
would
happen
that
a
glance
or
an
expression
as
full
of
significance
as
the
utterance
of
a
savage
would
drop
from
him
and
bear
witness
to
past
storms
in
his
soul
and
a
careful
study
of
his
placid
brow
revealed
a
power
of
stifling
down
and
repressing
his
passions
into
inner
depths
that
had
been
dearly
bought
by
a
lengthy
acquaintance
with
the
perils
and
disastrous
hazards
of
war
an
officer
who
had
only
just
joined
the
regiment
the
son
of
a
peer
of
france
had
said
one
day
of
genestas
that
he
would
have
made
one
of
the
most
conscientious
of
priests
or
the
most
upright
of
tradesmen
add
the
least
of
a
courtier
among
marquises
put
in
genestas
scanning
the
young
puppy
who
did
not
know
that
his
commandant
could
overhear
him
there
was
a
burst
of
laughter
at
the
words
for
the
lieutenant
s
father
cringed
to
all
the
powers
that
be
he
was
a
man
of
supple
intellect
accustomed
to
jump
with
every
change
of
government
and
his
son
took
after
him
men
like
genestas
are
met
with
now
and
again
in
the
french
army
natures
that
show
themselves
to
be
wholly
great
at
need
and
relapse
into
their
ordinary
simplicity
when
the
action
is
over
men
that
are
little
mindful
of
fame
and
reputation
and
utterly
forgetful
of
danger
perhaps
there
are
many
more
of
them
than
the
shortcomings
of
our
own
characters
will
allow
us
to
imagine
yet
for
all
that
any
one
who
believed
that
genestas
was
perfect
would
be
strangely
deceiving
himself
the
major
was
suspicious
given
to
violent
outbursts
of
anger
and
apt
to
be
tiresome
in
argument
he
was
full
of
national
prejudices
and
above
all
things
would
insist
that
he
was
in
the
right
when
he
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
wrong
he
retained
the
liking
for
good
wine
that
he
had
acquired
in
the
ranks
if
he
rose
from
a
banquet
with
all
the
gravity
befitting
his
position
he
seemed
serious
and
pensive
and
had
no
mind
at
such
times
to
admit
any
one
into
his
confidence
finally
although
he
was
sufficiently
acquainted
with
the
customs
of
society
and
with
the
laws
of
politeness
to
which
he
conformed
as
rigidly
as
if
they
had
been
military
regulations
though
he
had
real
mental
power
both
natural
and
acquired
and
although
he
had
mastered
the
art
of
handling
men
the
science
of
tactics
the
theory
of
sabre
play
and
the
mysteries
of
the
farrier
s
craft
his
learning
had
been
prodigiously
neglected
he
knew
in
a
hazy
kind
of
way
that
caesar
was
a
roman
consul
or
an
emperor
and
that
alexander
was
either
a
greek
or
a
macedonian
he
would
have
conceded
either
quality
or
origin
in
both
cases
without
discussion
if
the
conversation
turned
on
science
or
history
he
was
wont
to
become
thoughtful
and
to
confine
his
share
in
it
to
little
approving
nods
like
a
man
who
by
dint
of
profound
thought
has
arrived
at
scepticism
when
at
schonbrunn
on
may
napoleon
wrote
the
bulletin
addressed
to
the
grand
army
then
the
masters
of
vienna
in
which
he
said
that
medea
the
austrian
princes
had
slain
their
children
with
their
own
genestas
who
had
been
recently
made
a
captain
did
not
wish
to
compromise
his
newly
conferred
dignity
by
asking
who
medea
was
he
relied
upon
napoleon
s
character
and
felt
quite
sure
that
the
emperor
was
incapable
of
making
any
announcement
not
in
proper
form
to
the
grand
army
and
the
house
of
austria
so
he
thought
that
medea
was
some
archduchess
whose
conduct
was
open
to
criticism
still
as
the
matter
might
have
some
bearing
on
the
art
of
war
he
felt
uneasy
about
the
medea
of
the
bulletin
until
a
day
arrived
when
mlle
raucourt
revived
the
tragedy
of
medea
the
captain
saw
the
placard
and
did
not
fail
to
repair
to
the
theatre
francais
that
evening
to
see
the
celebrated
actress
in
her
mythological
role
concerning
which
he
gained
some
information
from
his
neighbors
a
man
however
who
as
a
private
soldier
had
possessed
sufficient
force
of
character
to
learn
to
read
write
and
cipher
could
clearly
understand
that
as
a
captain
he
ought
to
continue
his
education
so
from
this
time
forth
he
read
new
books
and
romances
with
avidity
in
this
way
gaining
a
of
which
he
made
a
very
fair
use
he
went
so
far
in
his
gratitude
to
his
teachers
as
to
undertake
the
defence
of
remarking
that
in
his
opinion
he
was
instructive
and
not
seldom
profound
this
officer
whose
acquired
practical
wisdom
did
not
allow
him
to
make
any
journey
in
vain
had
just
come
from
grenoble
and
was
on
his
way
to
the
grande
chartreuse
after
obtaining
on
the
previous
evening
a
week
s
leave
of
absence
from
his
colonel
he
had
not
expected
that
the
journey
would
be
a
long
one
but
when
league
after
league
he
had
been
misled
as
to
the
distance
by
the
lying
statements
of
the
peasants
he
thought
it
would
be
prudent
not
to
venture
any
farther
without
fortifying
the
inner
man
small
as
were
his
chances
of
finding
any
housewife
in
her
dwelling
at
a
time
when
every
one
was
hard
at
work
in
the
fields
he
stopped
before
a
little
cluster
of
cottages
that
stood
about
a
piece
of
land
common
to
all
of
them
more
or
less
describing
a
square
which
was
open
to
all
comers
the
surface
of
the
soil
thus
held
in
conjoint
ownership
was
hard
and
carefully
swept
but
intersected
by
open
drains
roses
ivy
and
tall
grasses
grew
over
the
cracked
and
disjointed
walls
some
rags
were
drying
on
a
miserable
currant
bush
that
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
square
a
pig
wallowing
in
a
heap
of
straw
was
the
first
inhabitant
encountered
by
genestas
at
the
sound
of
horse
hoofs
the
creature
grunted
raised
its
head
and
put
a
great
black
cat
to
flight
a
young
peasant
girl
who
was
carrying
a
bundle
of
grass
on
her
head
suddenly
appeared
followed
at
a
distance
by
four
little
brats
clad
in
rags
it
is
true
but
vigorous
sunburned
picturesque
and
riotous
thorough
little
imps
looking
like
angels
the
sun
shone
down
with
an
indescribable
purifying
influence
upon
the
air
the
wretched
cottages
the
heaps
of
refuse
and
the
unkempt
little
crew
the
soldier
asked
whether
it
was
possible
to
obtain
a
cup
of
milk
all
the
answer
the
girl
made
him
was
a
hoarse
cry
an
old
woman
suddenly
appeared
on
the
threshold
of
one
of
the
cabins
and
the
young
peasant
girl
passed
on
into
a
cowshed
with
a
gesture
that
pointed
out
the
aforesaid
old
woman
towards
whom
genestas
went
taking
care
at
the
same
time
to
keep
a
tight
hold
on
his
horse
lest
the
children
who
were
already
running
about
under
his
hoofs
should
be
hurt
he
repeated
his
request
with
which
the
housewife
flatly
refused
to
comply
she
would
not
she
said
disturb
the
cream
on
the
pans
full
of
milk
from
which
butter
was
to
be
made
the
officer
overcame
this
objection
by
undertaking
to
repay
her
amply
for
the
wasted
cream
and
then
tied
up
his
horse
at
the
door
and
went
inside
the
cottage
the
four
children
belonging
to
the
woman
all
appeared
to
be
of
the
same
age
an
odd
circumstance
which
struck
the
commandant
a
fifth
clung
about
her
skirts
a
weak
pale
child
who
doubtless
needed
more
care
than
the
others
and
who
on
that
account
was
the
best
beloved
the
benjamin
of
the
family
genestas
seated
himself
in
a
corner
by
the
fireless
hearth
a
sublime
symbol
met
his
eyes
on
the
high
above
him
a
colored
plaster
cast
of
the
virgin
with
the
child
jesus
in
her
arms
bare
earth
made
the
flooring
of
the
cottage
it
had
been
beaten
level
in
the
first
instance
but
in
course
of
time
it
had
grown
rough
and
uneven
so
that
though
it
was
clean
its
ruggedness
was
not
unlike
that
of
the
magnified
rind
of
an
orange
a
sabot
filled
with
salt
a
and
a
large
kettle
hung
inside
the
chimney
the
farther
end
of
the
room
was
completely
filled
by
a
bedstead
with
a
scalloped
valance
for
decoration
the
walls
were
black
there
was
an
opening
to
admit
the
light
above
the
door
and
here
and
there
were
a
few
stools
consisting
of
rough
blocks
of
each
set
upon
three
wooden
legs
a
hutch
for
bread
a
large
wooden
dipper
a
bucket
and
some
earthen
a
on
the
top
of
the
and
a
few
wicker
mats
for
draining
cheeses
such
were
the
ornaments
and
household
furniture
of
the
wretched
dwelling
the
officer
who
had
been
absorbed
in
flicking
his
against
the
floor
presently
became
a
witness
to
a
piece
of
all
unsuspicious
though
he
was
that
any
drama
was
about
to
unfold
itself
no
sooner
had
the
old
woman
followed
by
her
benjamin
disappeared
through
a
door
that
led
into
her
dairy
than
the
four
children
after
having
stared
at
the
soldier
as
long
as
they
wished
drove
away
the
pig
by
way
of
a
beginning
this
animal
their
accustomed
playmate
having
come
as
far
as
the
threshold
the
little
brats
made
such
an
energetic
attack
upon
him
that
he
was
forced
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
when
the
enemy
had
been
driven
without
the
children
besieged
the
latch
of
a
door
that
gave
way
before
their
united
efforts
and
slipped
out
of
the
worn
staple
that
held
it
and
finally
they
bolted
into
a
kind
of
where
they
very
soon
fell
to
munching
the
dried
plums
to
the
amusement
of
the
commandant
who
watched
this
spectacle
the
old
woman
with
the
face
like
parchment
and
the
dirty
ragged
clothing
came
back
at
this
moment
with
a
jug
of
milk
for
her
visitor
in
her
hand
oh
you
cried
she
she
ran
to
the
children
clutched
an
arm
of
each
child
bundled
them
into
the
room
and
carefully
closed
the
door
of
her
storeroom
of
plenty
but
she
did
not
take
their
prunes
away
from
them
now
then
be
good
my
pets
if
one
did
not
look
after
them
she
went
on
looking
at
genestas
they
would
eat
up
the
whole
lot
of
prunes
the
madcaps
then
she
seated
herself
on
a
stool
drew
the
little
weakling
between
her
knees
and
began
to
comb
and
wash
his
head
with
a
woman
s
skill
and
with
motherly
assiduity
the
four
small
thieves
hung
about
some
of
them
stood
others
leant
against
the
bed
or
the
they
gnawed
their
prunes
without
saying
a
word
but
they
kept
their
sly
and
mischievous
eyes
fixed
upon
the
stranger
in
spite
of
grimy
countenances
and
noses
that
stood
in
need
of
wiping
they
all
looked
strong
and
healthy
are
they
your
children
the
soldier
asked
the
old
woman
asking
your
pardon
sir
they
are
charity
children
they
give
me
three
francs
a
month
and
a
pound
s
weight
of
soap
for
each
of
but
it
must
cost
you
twice
as
much
as
that
to
keep
them
good
woman
that
is
just
what
benassis
tells
me
sir
but
if
other
folk
will
board
the
children
for
the
same
money
one
has
to
make
it
do
nobody
wants
the
children
but
for
all
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
performance
to
go
through
before
they
will
let
us
have
them
when
the
milk
we
give
them
comes
to
nothing
they
cost
us
scarcely
anything
besides
that
three
francs
is
a
great
deal
sir
there
are
fifteen
francs
coming
in
to
say
nothing
of
the
five
pounds
weight
of
soap
in
our
part
of
the
world
you
would
simply
have
to
wear
your
life
out
before
you
would
make
ten
sous
a
then
you
have
some
land
of
your
own
asked
the
commandant
no
sir
i
had
some
land
once
when
my
husband
was
alive
since
he
died
i
have
done
so
badly
that
i
had
to
sell
why
how
do
you
reach
the
year
s
end
without
debts
genestas
went
on
when
you
bring
up
children
for
a
livelihood
and
wash
and
feed
them
on
two
sous
a
day
well
we
never
go
to
sylvester
s
day
without
debt
sir
she
went
on
without
ceasing
to
comb
the
child
s
hair
but
so
it
is
providence
helps
us
out
i
have
a
couple
of
cows
then
my
daughter
and
i
do
some
gleaning
at
and
in
winter
we
pick
up
firewood
then
at
night
we
spin
ah
we
never
want
to
see
another
winter
like
this
last
one
that
is
certain
i
owe
the
miller
francs
for
flour
luckily
he
is
benassis
miller
benassis
ah
he
is
a
friend
to
poor
people
he
has
never
asked
for
his
due
from
anybody
and
he
will
not
begin
with
us
besides
our
cow
has
a
calf
and
that
will
set
us
a
bit
the
four
orphans
for
whom
the
old
woman
s
affection
represented
all
human
guardianship
had
come
to
an
end
of
their
prunes
as
their
s
attention
was
taken
up
by
the
officer
with
whom
she
was
chatting
they
seized
the
opportunity
and
banded
themselves
together
in
a
compact
file
so
as
to
make
yet
another
assault
upon
the
latch
of
the
door
that
stood
between
them
and
the
tempting
heap
of
dried
plums
they
advanced
to
the
attack
not
like
french
soldiers
but
as
stealthily
as
germans
impelled
by
frank
animal
greediness
oh
you
little
rogues
do
you
want
to
finish
them
up
the
old
woman
rose
caught
the
strongest
of
the
four
administered
a
gentle
slap
on
the
back
and
flung
him
out
of
the
house
not
a
tear
did
he
shed
but
the
others
remained
breathless
with
astonishment
they
give
you
a
lot
of
trouble
oh
no
sir
but
they
can
smell
the
prunes
the
little
dears
if
i
were
to
leave
them
alone
here
for
a
moment
they
would
stuff
themselves
with
you
are
very
fond
of
them
the
old
woman
raised
her
head
at
this
and
looked
at
him
with
gentle
malice
in
her
eyes
fond
of
them
she
said
i
have
had
to
part
with
three
of
them
already
i
only
have
the
care
of
them
until
they
are
six
years
old
she
went
on
with
a
sigh
but
where
are
your
own
children
i
have
lost
how
old
are
you
genestas
asked
to
efface
the
impression
left
by
his
last
question
i
am
years
old
sir
it
will
be
two
years
come
next
john
s
day
since
my
husband
she
finished
dressing
the
poor
sickly
mite
who
seemed
to
thank
her
by
a
loving
look
in
his
faded
eyes
what
a
life
of
toil
and
thought
the
cavalry
officer
beneath
a
roof
worthy
of
the
stable
wherein
jesus
christ
was
born
the
hardest
duties
of
motherhood
were
fulfilled
cheerfully
and
without
consciousness
of
merit
what
hearts
were
these
that
lay
so
deeply
buried
in
neglect
and
obscurity
what
wealth
and
what
poverty
soldiers
better
than
other
men
can
appreciate
the
element
of
grandeur
to
be
found
in
heroism
in
sabots
in
the
evangel
clad
in
rags
the
book
may
be
found
elsewhere
adorned
embellished
tricked
out
in
silk
and
satin
and
brocade
but
here
of
a
surety
dwelt
the
spirit
of
the
book
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
that
heaven
had
some
holy
purpose
underlying
it
all
at
the
sight
of
the
woman
who
had
taken
a
mother
s
lot
upon
herself
as
jesus
christ
had
taken
the
form
of
a
man
who
gleaned
and
suffered
and
ran
into
debt
for
her
little
waifs
a
woman
who
defrauded
herself
in
her
reckonings
and
would
not
own
that
she
was
ruining
herself
that
she
might
be
a
mother
one
was
constrained
to
admit
at
the
sight
of
her
that
the
good
upon
earth
have
something
in
common
with
the
angels
in
heaven
commandant
genestas
shook
his
head
as
he
looked
at
her
is
benassis
a
clever
doctor
he
asked
at
last
i
do
not
know
sir
but
he
cures
poor
people
for
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
man
and
no
mistake
he
went
on
speaking
to
himself
oh
yes
sir
and
a
good
man
too
there
is
scarcely
any
one
hereabouts
that
does
not
put
his
name
in
their
prayers
morning
and
night
that
is
for
you
mother
said
the
soldier
as
he
gave
her
several
coins
and
that
is
for
the
children
he
went
on
as
he
added
another
crown
is
benassis
house
still
a
long
way
off
he
asked
when
he
had
mounted
his
horse
oh
no
sir
a
bare
league
at
the
commandant
set
out
fully
persuaded
that
two
leagues
remained
ahead
of
him
yet
after
all
he
soon
caught
a
glimpse
through
the
trees
of
the
little
town
s
first
cluster
of
houses
and
then
of
all
the
roofs
that
crowded
about
a
conical
steeple
whose
slates
were
secured
to
the
angles
of
the
wooden
framework
by
sheets
of
tin
that
glittered
in
the
sun
this
sort
of
roof
which
has
a
peculiar
appearance
denotes
the
nearness
of
the
borders
of
savoy
where
it
is
very
common
the
valley
is
wide
at
this
particular
point
and
a
fair
number
of
houses
pleasantly
situated
either
in
the
little
plain
or
along
the
side
of
the
mountain
stream
lend
human
interest
to
the
spot
a
stronghold
with
no
apparent
outlet
among
the
mountains
that
surround
it
it
was
noon
when
genestas
reined
in
his
horse
beneath
an
avenue
of
up
the
hillside
and
only
a
few
paces
from
the
town
to
ask
the
group
of
children
who
stood
before
him
for
benassis
house
at
first
the
children
looked
at
each
other
then
they
scrutinized
the
stranger
with
the
expression
that
they
usually
wear
when
they
set
eyes
upon
anything
for
the
first
time
a
different
curiosity
and
a
different
thought
in
every
little
face
then
the
boldest
and
the
merriest
of
the
band
a
little
urchin
with
bare
muddy
feet
repeated
his
words
over
again
in
child
fashion
m
benassis
house
sir
adding
i
will
show
you
the
way
he
walked
along
in
front
of
the
horse
prompted
quite
as
much
by
a
wish
to
gain
a
kind
of
importance
by
being
in
the
stranger
s
company
as
by
a
child
s
love
of
being
useful
or
the
imperative
craving
to
be
doing
something
that
possesses
mind
and
body
at
his
age
the
officer
followed
him
for
the
entire
length
of
the
principal
street
of
the
country
town
the
way
was
paved
with
cobblestones
and
wound
in
and
out
among
the
houses
which
their
owners
had
erected
along
its
course
in
the
most
arbitrary
fashion
in
one
place
a
had
been
built
out
into
the
middle
of
the
roadway
in
another
a
gable
protruded
partially
obstructing
the
passage
and
yet
farther
on
a
mountain
stream
flowed
across
it
in
a
runnel
genestas
noticed
a
fair
number
of
roofs
of
tarred
shingle
but
yet
more
of
them
were
thatched
a
few
were
tiled
and
some
seven
or
eight
belonging
no
doubt
to
the
cure
the
justice
of
the
peace
and
some
of
the
wealthier
townsmen
were
covered
with
slates
there
was
a
total
absence
of
regard
for
appearances
befitting
a
village
at
the
end
of
the
world
which
had
nothing
beyond
it
and
no
connection
with
any
other
place
the
people
who
lived
in
it
seemed
to
belong
to
one
family
that
dwelt
beyond
the
limits
of
the
bustling
world
with
which
the
collector
of
taxes
and
a
few
ties
of
the
very
slenderest
alone
served
to
connect
them
when
genestas
had
gone
a
step
or
two
farther
he
saw
on
the
mountain
side
a
broad
road
that
rose
above
the
village
clearly
there
must
be
an
old
town
and
a
new
town
and
indeed
when
the
commandant
reached
a
spot
where
he
could
slacken
the
pace
of
his
horse
he
could
easily
see
between
the
houses
some
dwellings
whose
new
roofs
brightened
the
village
an
avenue
of
trees
rose
above
these
new
houses
and
from
among
them
came
the
confused
sounds
of
several
industries
he
heard
the
songs
peculiar
to
busy
toilers
a
murmur
of
many
workshops
the
rasping
of
files
and
the
sound
of
falling
hammers
he
saw
the
thin
lines
of
smoke
from
the
chimneys
of
each
household
and
the
more
copious
outpourings
from
the
forges
of
the
the
blacksmith
and
the
farrier
at
length
at
the
very
end
of
the
village
towards
which
his
guide
was
taking
him
genestas
beheld
scattered
farms
and
fields
and
plantations
of
trees
in
thorough
order
it
might
have
been
a
little
corner
of
brie
so
hidden
away
in
a
great
fold
of
the
land
that
at
first
sight
its
existence
would
not
be
suspected
between
the
little
town
and
the
mountains
that
closed
the
country
round
presently
the
child
stopped
there
is
the
door
of
house
he
remarked
the
officer
dismounted
and
passed
his
arm
through
the
bridle
then
thinking
that
the
laborer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
he
drew
a
few
sous
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
held
them
out
to
the
child
who
looked
astonished
at
this
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
and
stayed
on
without
thanking
him
to
watch
what
the
stranger
would
do
next
civilization
has
not
made
much
headway
hereabouts
thought
genestas
the
religion
of
work
is
in
full
force
and
begging
has
not
yet
come
thus
his
guide
more
from
curiosity
than
from
any
interested
motive
propped
himself
against
the
wall
that
rose
to
the
height
of
a
man
s
elbow
upon
this
wall
which
enclosed
the
yard
belonging
to
the
house
there
ran
a
black
wooden
railing
on
either
side
of
the
square
pillars
of
the
gates
the
lower
part
of
the
gates
themselves
was
of
solid
wood
that
had
been
painted
gray
at
some
period
in
the
past
the
upper
part
consisted
of
a
grating
of
yellowish
bars
these
decorations
which
had
lost
all
their
color
gradually
rose
on
either
half
of
the
gates
till
they
reached
the
centre
where
they
met
their
spikes
forming
when
both
leaves
were
shut
an
outline
similar
to
that
of
a
the
gates
themselves
with
their
patches
of
velvet
lichen
were
almost
destroyed
by
the
alternate
action
of
sun
and
rain
a
few
aloe
plants
and
some
pellitory
grew
on
the
tops
of
the
square
pillars
of
the
gates
which
all
but
concealed
the
stems
of
a
couple
of
thornless
acacias
that
raised
their
tufted
spikes
like
a
pair
of
green
in
the
yard
the
condition
of
the
gateway
revealed
a
certain
carelessness
of
its
owner
which
did
not
seem
to
suit
the
officer
s
turn
of
mind
he
knitted
his
brows
like
a
man
who
is
obliged
to
relinquish
some
illusion
we
usually
judge
others
by
our
own
standard
and
although
we
indulgently
forgive
our
own
shortcomings
in
them
we
condemn
them
harshly
for
the
lack
of
our
special
virtues
if
the
commandant
had
expected
benassis
to
be
a
methodical
or
practical
man
there
were
unmistakable
indications
of
absolute
indifference
as
to
his
material
concerns
in
the
state
of
the
gates
of
his
house
a
soldier
possessed
by
genestas
passion
for
domestic
economy
could
not
help
at
once
drawing
inferences
as
to
the
life
and
character
of
its
owner
from
the
gateway
before
him
and
this
in
spite
of
his
habits
of
circumspection
he
in
nowise
failed
to
do
the
gates
were
left
ajar
moreover
another
piece
of
carelessness
encouraged
by
this
countrified
trust
in
all
comers
the
officer
entered
the
yard
without
ceremony
and
tethered
his
horse
to
the
bars
of
the
gate
while
he
was
knotting
the
bridle
a
neighing
sound
from
the
stable
caused
both
horse
and
rider
to
turn
their
eyes
involuntarily
in
that
direction
the
door
opened
and
an
old
servant
put
out
his
head
he
wore
a
red
woolen
bonnet
exactly
like
the
phrygian
cap
in
which
liberty
is
tricked
out
a
piece
of
in
common
use
in
this
country
as
there
was
room
for
several
horses
this
worthy
individual
after
inquiring
whether
genestas
had
come
to
see
benassis
offered
the
hospitality
of
the
stable
to
the
steed
a
very
fine
animal
at
which
he
looked
with
an
expression
of
admiring
affection
the
commandant
followed
his
horse
to
see
how
things
were
to
go
with
it
the
stable
was
clean
there
was
plenty
of
litter
and
there
was
the
same
peculiar
air
of
sleek
content
about
benassis
pair
of
horses
that
distinguished
the
cure
s
horse
from
all
the
rest
of
his
tribe
a
from
within
the
house
came
out
upon
the
flight
of
steps
and
waited
she
appeared
to
be
the
proper
authority
to
whom
the
stranger
s
inquiries
were
to
be
addressed
although
the
stableman
had
already
told
him
that
benassis
was
not
at
home
the
master
has
gone
to
the
said
he
if
you
like
to
overtake
him
you
have
only
to
go
along
the
path
that
leads
to
the
meadow
and
the
mill
is
at
the
end
of
genestas
preferred
seeing
the
country
to
waiting
about
indefinitely
for
benassis
return
so
he
set
out
along
the
way
that
led
to
the
when
he
had
gone
beyond
the
irregular
line
traced
by
the
town
upon
the
hillside
he
came
in
sight
of
the
mill
and
the
valley
and
of
one
of
the
loveliest
landscapes
that
he
had
ever
seen
the
mountains
bar
the
course
of
the
river
which
forms
a
little
lake
at
their
feet
and
raise
their
crests
above
it
tier
on
tier
their
many
valleys
are
revealed
by
the
changing
hues
of
the
light
or
by
the
more
or
less
clear
outlines
of
the
mountain
ridges
fledged
with
their
dark
forests
of
pines
the
mill
had
not
long
been
built
it
stood
just
where
the
mountain
stream
fell
into
the
little
lake
there
was
all
the
charm
about
it
peculiar
to
a
lonely
house
surrounded
by
water
and
hidden
away
behind
the
heads
of
a
few
trees
that
love
to
grow
by
the
on
the
farther
bank
of
the
river
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
with
a
faint
red
glow
of
sunset
upon
its
highest
crest
genestas
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
dozen
deserted
cottages
all
the
windows
and
doors
had
been
taken
away
and
sufficiently
large
holes
were
conspicuous
in
the
dilapidated
roofs
but
the
surrounding
land
was
laid
out
in
fields
that
were
highly
cultivated
and
the
old
garden
spaces
had
been
turned
into
meadows
watered
by
a
system
of
irrigation
as
artfully
contrived
as
that
in
use
in
limousin
unconsciously
the
commandant
paused
to
look
at
the
ruins
of
the
village
before
him
how
is
it
that
men
can
never
behold
any
ruins
even
of
the
humblest
kind
without
feeling
deeply
stirred
doubtless
it
is
because
they
seem
to
be
a
typical
representation
of
evil
fortune
whose
weight
is
felt
so
differently
by
different
natures
the
thought
of
death
is
called
up
by
a
churchyard
but
a
deserted
village
puts
us
in
mind
of
the
sorrows
of
life
death
is
but
one
misfortune
always
foreseen
but
the
sorrows
of
life
are
infinite
does
not
the
thought
of
the
infinite
underlie
all
great
melancholy
the
officer
reached
the
stony
path
by
the
before
he
could
hit
upon
an
explanation
of
this
deserted
village
the
miller
s
lad
was
sitting
on
some
sacks
of
corn
near
the
door
of
the
house
genestas
asked
for
benassis
m
benassis
went
over
there
said
the
miller
pointing
out
one
of
the
ruined
cottages
has
the
village
been
burned
down
asked
the
commandant
no
then
how
did
it
come
to
be
in
this
state
inquired
genestas
ah
how
the
miller
answered
as
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
went
indoors
m
benassis
will
tell
you
the
officer
went
over
a
rough
sort
of
bridge
built
up
of
boulders
taken
from
the
torrent
bed
and
soon
reached
the
house
that
had
been
pointed
out
to
him
the
thatched
roof
of
the
dwelling
was
still
entire
it
was
covered
with
moss
indeed
but
there
were
no
holes
in
it
and
the
door
and
its
fastenings
seemed
to
be
in
good
repair
genestas
saw
a
fire
on
the
hearth
as
he
entered
an
old
woman
kneeling
in
the
before
a
sick
man
seated
in
a
chair
and
another
man
who
was
standing
with
his
face
turned
toward
the
fireplace
the
house
consisted
of
a
single
room
which
was
lighted
by
a
wretched
window
covered
with
linen
cloth
the
floor
was
of
beaten
earth
the
chair
a
table
and
a
comprised
the
whole
of
the
furniture
the
commandant
had
never
seen
anything
so
poor
and
bare
not
even
in
russia
where
the
moujik
s
huts
are
like
the
dens
of
wild
beasts
nothing
within
it
spoke
of
ordinary
life
there
were
not
even
the
simplest
appliances
for
cooking
food
of
the
commonest
description
it
might
have
been
a
without
a
but
for
the
a
hanging
from
a
nail
and
some
sabots
filled
with
straw
which
composed
the
invalid
s
entire
wardrobe
this
cottage
would
have
looked
as
empty
as
the
others
the
aged
peasant
woman
upon
her
knees
was
devoting
all
her
attention
to
keeping
the
sufferer
s
feet
in
a
tub
filled
with
a
brown
liquid
hearing
a
footstep
and
the
clank
of
spurs
which
sounded
strangely
in
ears
accustomed
to
the
plodding
pace
of
country
folk
the
man
turned
to
genestas
a
sort
of
surprise
in
which
the
old
woman
shared
was
visible
in
his
face
there
is
no
need
to
ask
if
you
are
benassis
said
the
soldier
you
will
pardon
me
sir
if
as
a
stranger
impatient
to
see
you
i
have
come
to
seek
you
on
your
field
of
battle
instead
of
awaiting
you
at
your
house
pray
do
not
disturb
yourself
go
on
with
what
you
are
doing
when
it
is
over
i
will
tell
you
the
purpose
of
my
genestas
half
seated
himself
upon
the
edge
of
the
table
and
remained
silent
the
firelight
shone
more
brightly
in
the
room
than
the
faint
rays
of
the
sun
for
the
mountain
crests
intercepted
them
so
that
they
seldom
reached
this
corner
of
the
valley
a
few
branches
of
resinous
pinewood
made
a
bright
blaze
and
it
was
by
the
light
of
this
fire
that
the
soldier
saw
the
face
of
the
man
towards
whom
he
was
drawn
by
a
secret
motive
by
a
wish
to
seek
him
out
to
study
and
to
know
him
thoroughly
well
benassis
the
local
doctor
heard
genestas
with
indifference
and
with
folded
arms
he
returned
his
bow
and
went
back
to
his
patient
quite
unaware
that
he
was
being
subjected
to
a
scrutiny
as
earnest
as
that
which
the
soldier
turned
upon
him
benassis
was
a
man
of
ordinary
height
and
a
capacious
green
overcoat
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
prevented
the
officer
from
observing
any
characteristic
details
of
his
personal
appearance
but
his
dark
and
motionless
figure
served
as
a
strong
relief
to
his
face
which
caught
the
bright
light
of
the
blazing
fire
the
face
was
not
unlike
that
of
a
satyr
there
was
the
same
slightly
protruding
forehead
full
in
this
case
of
prominences
all
more
or
less
denoting
character
the
same
nose
with
a
sprightly
cleavage
at
the
tip
the
same
high
the
lines
of
the
mouth
were
crooked
the
lips
thick
and
red
the
chin
turned
sharply
upwards
there
was
an
alert
animated
look
in
the
brown
eyes
to
which
their
pearly
whites
gave
great
brightness
and
which
expressed
passions
now
subdued
his
hair
the
deep
wrinkles
in
his
face
the
bushy
eyebrows
that
had
grown
white
already
the
veins
on
his
protuberant
nose
the
tanned
face
covered
with
red
blotches
everything
about
him
in
short
indicated
a
man
of
fifty
and
the
hard
work
of
his
profession
the
officer
could
come
to
no
conclusion
as
to
the
capacity
of
the
head
which
was
covered
by
a
close
cap
but
hidden
though
it
was
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
one
of
the
kind
that
gave
rise
to
the
expression
genestas
was
accustomed
to
read
the
indications
that
mark
the
features
of
men
destined
to
do
great
things
since
he
had
been
brought
into
close
relations
with
the
energetic
natures
sought
out
by
napoleon
so
he
suspected
that
there
must
be
some
mystery
in
this
life
of
obscurity
and
said
to
himself
as
he
looked
at
the
remarkable
face
before
him
how
comes
it
that
he
is
still
a
country
doctor
when
he
had
made
a
careful
study
of
this
countenance
that
in
spite
of
its
resemblance
to
other
human
faces
revealed
an
inner
life
nowise
in
harmony
with
a
commonplace
exterior
he
could
not
help
sharing
the
doctor
s
interest
in
his
patient
and
the
sight
of
that
patient
completely
changed
the
current
of
his
thoughts
much
as
the
old
cavalry
officer
had
seen
in
the
course
of
his
soldier
s
career
he
felt
a
thrill
of
surprise
and
horror
at
the
sight
of
a
human
face
which
could
never
have
been
lighted
up
with
thought
a
livid
face
in
which
a
look
of
dumb
suffering
showed
so
plainly
the
same
look
that
is
sometimes
worn
by
a
child
too
young
to
speak
and
too
weak
to
cry
any
longer
in
short
it
was
the
wholly
animal
face
of
an
old
dying
cretin
the
cretin
was
the
one
variety
of
the
human
species
with
which
the
commandant
had
not
yet
come
in
contact
at
the
sight
of
the
deep
circular
folds
of
skin
on
the
forehead
the
sodden
eyes
and
the
head
with
its
short
coarse
hair
a
head
utterly
divested
of
all
the
faculties
of
the
senses
who
would
not
have
experienced
as
genestas
did
an
instinctive
feeling
of
repulsion
for
a
being
that
had
neither
the
physical
beauty
of
an
animal
nor
the
mental
endowments
of
man
who
was
possessed
of
neither
instinct
nor
reason
and
who
had
never
heard
nor
spoken
any
kind
of
articulate
speech
it
seemed
difficult
to
expend
any
regrets
over
the
poor
wretch
now
visibly
drawing
towards
the
very
end
of
an
existence
which
had
not
been
life
in
any
sense
of
the
word
yet
the
old
woman
watched
him
with
touching
anxiety
and
was
rubbing
his
legs
where
the
hot
water
did
not
reach
them
with
as
much
tenderness
as
if
he
had
been
her
husband
benassis
himself
after
a
close
scrutiny
of
the
dull
eyes
and
face
gently
took
the
cretin
s
hand
and
felt
his
pulse
the
bath
is
doing
no
good
he
said
shaking
his
head
let
us
put
him
to
bed
he
lifted
the
inert
mass
himself
and
carried
him
across
to
the
from
whence
no
doubt
he
had
just
taken
him
carefully
he
laid
him
at
full
length
and
straightened
the
limbs
that
were
growing
cold
already
putting
the
head
and
hand
in
position
with
all
the
heed
that
a
mother
could
bestow
upon
her
child
it
is
all
over
death
is
very
near
added
benassis
who
remained
standing
by
the
bedside
the
old
woman
gazed
at
the
dying
form
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
a
few
tears
stole
down
her
cheeks
genestas
remained
silent
he
was
unable
to
explain
to
himself
how
it
was
that
the
death
of
a
being
that
concerned
him
so
little
should
affect
him
so
much
unconsciously
he
shared
the
feeling
of
boundless
pity
that
these
hapless
creatures
excite
among
the
dwellers
in
the
sunless
valleys
wherein
nature
has
placed
them
this
sentiment
has
degenerated
into
a
kind
of
religious
superstition
in
families
to
which
cretins
belong
but
does
it
not
spring
from
the
most
beautiful
of
christian
virtues
from
charity
and
from
a
belief
in
a
reward
hereafter
that
most
effectual
support
of
our
social
system
and
the
one
thought
that
enables
us
to
endure
our
miseries
the
hope
of
inheriting
eternal
bliss
helps
the
relations
of
these
unhappy
creatures
and
all
others
round
about
them
to
exert
on
a
large
scale
and
with
sublime
devotion
a
mother
s
ceaseless
protecting
care
over
an
apathetic
creature
who
does
not
understand
it
in
the
first
instance
and
who
in
a
little
while
forgets
it
all
wonderful
power
of
religion
that
has
brought
a
blind
beneficence
to
the
aid
of
an
equally
blind
misery
wherever
cretins
exist
there
is
a
popular
belief
that
the
presence
of
one
of
these
creatures
brings
luck
to
a
family
a
superstition
that
serves
to
sweeten
lives
which
in
the
midst
of
a
town
population
would
be
condemned
by
a
mistaken
philanthropy
to
submit
to
the
harsh
discipline
of
an
asylum
in
the
higher
end
of
the
valley
of
isere
where
cretins
are
very
numerous
they
lead
an
life
with
the
cattle
which
they
are
taught
to
herd
there
at
any
rate
they
are
at
large
and
receive
the
reverence
due
to
misfortune
a
moment
later
the
village
bell
clinked
at
slow
regular
intervals
to
acquaint
the
flock
with
the
death
of
one
of
their
number
in
the
sound
that
reached
the
cottage
but
faintly
across
the
intervening
space
there
was
a
thought
of
religion
which
seemed
to
fill
it
with
a
melancholy
peace
the
tread
of
many
feet
echoed
up
the
road
giving
notice
of
an
approaching
crowd
of
people
a
crowd
that
uttered
not
a
word
then
suddenly
the
chanting
of
the
church
broke
the
stillness
calling
up
the
confused
thoughts
that
take
possession
of
the
most
sceptical
minds
and
compel
them
to
yield
to
the
influence
of
the
touching
harmonies
of
the
human
voice
the
church
was
coming
to
the
aid
of
a
creature
that
knew
her
not
the
cure
appeared
preceded
by
a
who
bore
the
crucifix
and
followed
by
the
sacristan
carrying
the
vase
of
holy
water
and
by
some
fifty
women
old
men
and
children
who
had
all
come
to
add
their
prayers
to
those
of
the
church
the
doctor
and
the
soldier
looked
at
each
other
and
silently
withdrew
to
a
corner
to
make
room
for
the
kneeling
crowd
within
and
without
the
cottage
during
the
consoling
ceremony
of
the
viaticum
celebrated
for
one
who
had
never
sinned
but
to
whom
the
church
on
earth
was
bidding
a
last
farewell
there
were
signs
of
real
sorrow
on
most
of
the
rough
faces
of
the
gathering
and
tears
flowed
over
the
rugged
cheeks
that
sun
and
wind
and
labor
in
the
fields
had
tanned
and
wrinkled
the
sentiment
of
voluntary
kinship
was
easy
to
explain
there
was
not
one
in
the
place
who
had
not
pitied
the
unhappy
creature
not
one
who
would
not
have
given
him
his
daily
bread
had
he
not
met
with
a
father
s
care
from
every
child
and
found
a
mother
in
the
merriest
little
girl
he
is
dead
said
the
cure
the
words
struck
his
hearers
with
the
most
unfeigned
dismay
the
tall
candles
were
lighted
and
several
people
undertook
to
watch
with
the
dead
that
night
benassis
and
the
soldier
went
out
a
group
of
peasants
in
the
doorway
stopped
the
doctor
to
say
ah
if
you
have
not
saved
his
life
sir
it
was
doubtless
because
god
wished
to
take
him
to
i
did
my
best
children
the
doctor
answered
when
they
had
come
a
few
paces
from
the
deserted
village
whose
last
inhabitant
had
just
died
the
doctor
spoke
to
genestas
you
would
not
believe
sir
what
real
solace
is
contained
for
me
in
what
those
peasants
have
just
said
ten
years
ago
i
was
very
nearly
stoned
to
death
in
this
village
it
is
empty
but
thirty
families
lived
in
it
genestas
face
and
gesture
so
plainly
expressed
an
inquiry
that
as
they
went
along
the
doctor
told
him
the
story
promised
by
this
beginning
when
i
first
settled
here
sir
i
found
a
dozen
cretins
in
this
part
of
the
canton
and
the
doctor
turned
round
to
point
out
the
ruined
cottages
for
the
officer
s
benefit
all
the
favorable
conditions
for
spreading
the
hideous
disease
are
there
the
air
is
stagnant
the
hamlet
lies
in
the
valley
bottom
close
beside
a
torrent
supplied
with
water
by
the
melted
snows
and
the
sunlight
only
falls
on
the
so
that
the
valley
itself
gets
no
good
of
the
sun
marriages
among
these
unfortunate
creatures
are
not
forbidden
by
law
and
in
this
district
they
are
protected
by
superstitious
notions
of
whose
power
i
had
no
conception
superstitions
which
i
blamed
at
first
and
afterwards
came
to
admire
so
cretinism
was
in
a
fair
way
to
spread
all
over
the
valley
from
this
spot
was
it
not
doing
the
country
a
great
service
to
put
a
stop
to
this
mental
and
physical
contagion
but
imperatively
as
the
salutary
changes
were
required
they
might
cost
the
life
of
any
man
who
endeavored
to
bring
them
about
here
as
in
other
social
spheres
if
any
good
is
to
be
done
we
come
into
collision
not
merely
with
vested
interests
but
with
something
far
more
dangerous
to
meddle
with
religious
ideas
crystallized
into
superstitions
the
most
permanent
form
taken
by
human
thought
i
feared
nothing
in
the
first
place
i
sought
for
the
position
of
mayor
in
the
canton
and
in
this
i
succeeded
then
after
obtaining
a
verbal
sanction
from
the
prefect
and
by
paying
down
the
money
i
had
several
of
these
unfortunate
creatures
transported
over
to
aiguebelle
in
savoy
by
night
there
are
a
great
many
of
them
there
and
they
were
certain
to
be
very
kindly
treated
when
this
act
of
humanity
came
to
be
known
the
whole
countryside
looked
upon
me
as
a
monster
the
cure
preached
against
me
in
spite
of
all
the
pains
i
took
to
explain
to
all
the
shrewder
heads
of
the
little
place
the
immense
importance
of
being
rid
of
the
idiots
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
i
gave
my
services
gratuitously
to
the
sick
people
of
the
district
a
shot
was
fired
at
me
from
the
corner
of
a
wood
i
went
to
the
bishop
of
grenoble
and
asked
him
to
change
the
cure
monseigneur
was
good
enough
to
allow
me
to
choose
a
priest
who
would
share
in
my
labors
and
it
was
my
happy
fortune
to
meet
with
one
of
those
rare
natures
that
seemed
to
have
dropped
down
from
heaven
then
i
went
on
with
my
enterprise
after
preparing
people
s
minds
i
made
another
transportation
by
night
and
six
more
cretins
were
taken
away
in
this
second
attempt
i
had
the
support
of
several
people
to
whom
i
had
rendered
some
service
and
i
was
backed
by
the
members
of
the
communal
council
for
i
had
appealed
to
their
parsimonious
instincts
showing
them
how
much
it
cost
to
support
the
poor
wretches
and
pointing
out
how
largely
they
might
gain
by
converting
their
plots
of
ground
to
which
the
idiots
had
no
proper
title
into
allotments
which
were
needed
in
the
township
all
the
rich
were
on
my
side
but
the
poor
the
old
women
the
children
and
a
few
people
were
violently
opposed
to
me
unluckily
it
so
fell
out
that
my
last
removal
had
not
been
completely
carried
out
the
cretin
whom
you
have
just
seen
not
having
returned
to
his
house
had
not
been
taken
away
so
that
the
next
morning
he
was
the
sole
remaining
example
of
his
species
in
the
village
there
were
several
families
still
living
there
but
though
they
were
little
better
than
idiots
they
were
at
any
rate
free
from
the
taint
of
cretinism
i
determined
to
go
through
with
my
work
and
came
officially
in
open
day
to
take
the
luckless
creature
from
his
dwelling
i
had
no
sooner
left
my
house
than
my
intention
got
abroad
the
cretin
s
friends
were
there
before
me
and
in
front
of
his
hovel
i
found
a
crowd
of
women
and
children
and
old
people
who
hailed
my
arrival
with
insults
accompanied
by
a
shower
of
stones
in
the
midst
of
the
uproar
i
should
perhaps
have
fallen
a
victim
to
the
frenzy
that
possesses
a
crowd
excited
by
its
own
outcries
and
stirred
up
by
one
common
feeling
but
the
cretin
saved
my
life
the
poor
creature
came
out
of
his
hut
and
raised
the
clucking
sound
of
his
voice
he
seemed
to
be
an
absolute
ruler
over
the
fanatical
mob
for
the
sight
of
him
put
a
sudden
stop
to
the
clamor
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
arrange
a
compromise
and
thanks
to
the
quiet
so
opportunely
restored
i
was
able
to
propose
and
explain
it
of
course
those
who
approved
of
my
schemes
would
not
dare
to
second
me
in
this
emergency
their
support
was
sure
to
be
of
a
purely
passive
kind
while
these
superstitious
folk
would
exert
the
most
active
vigilance
to
keep
their
last
idol
among
them
it
was
impossible
it
seemed
to
me
to
take
him
away
from
them
so
i
promised
to
leave
the
cretin
in
peace
in
his
dwelling
with
the
understanding
that
he
should
live
quite
by
himself
and
that
the
remaining
families
in
the
village
should
cross
the
stream
and
come
to
live
in
the
town
in
some
new
houses
which
i
myself
undertook
to
build
adding
to
each
house
a
piece
of
ground
for
which
the
commune
was
to
repay
me
later
on
well
my
dear
sir
it
took
me
fully
six
months
to
overcome
their
objection
to
this
bargain
however
much
it
may
have
been
to
the
advantage
of
the
village
families
the
affection
which
they
have
for
their
wretched
hovels
in
country
districts
is
something
quite
unexplainable
no
matter
how
unwholesome
his
hovel
may
be
a
peasant
clings
far
more
to
it
than
a
banker
does
to
his
mansion
the
reason
of
it
that
i
do
not
know
perhaps
thoughts
and
feelings
are
strongest
in
those
who
have
but
few
of
them
simply
because
they
have
but
few
perhaps
material
things
count
for
much
in
the
lives
of
those
who
live
so
little
in
thought
certain
it
is
that
the
less
they
have
the
dearer
their
possessions
are
to
them
perhaps
too
it
is
with
the
peasant
as
with
the
prisoner
he
does
not
squander
the
powers
of
his
soul
he
centres
them
all
upon
a
single
idea
and
this
is
how
his
feelings
come
to
be
so
exceedingly
strong
pardon
these
reflections
on
the
part
of
a
man
who
seldom
exchanges
ideas
with
any
one
but
indeed
you
must
not
suppose
sir
that
i
am
much
taken
up
with
these
considerations
we
all
have
to
be
active
and
practical
here
alas
the
fewer
ideas
these
poor
folk
have
in
their
heads
the
harder
it
is
to
make
them
see
where
their
real
interests
lie
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
give
my
whole
attention
to
every
trifling
detail
of
my
enterprise
one
and
all
made
me
the
same
answer
one
of
those
sayings
filled
with
homely
sense
to
which
there
is
no
possible
reply
but
your
houses
are
not
yet
built
sir
they
used
to
say
very
good
said
i
promise
me
that
as
soon
as
they
are
finished
you
will
come
and
live
in
luckily
sir
i
obtained
a
decision
to
the
effect
that
the
whole
of
the
mountain
side
above
the
now
deserted
village
was
the
property
of
the
township
the
sum
of
money
brought
in
by
the
woods
on
the
higher
slopes
paid
for
the
building
of
the
new
houses
and
for
the
land
on
which
they
stood
they
were
built
forthwith
and
when
once
one
of
my
refractory
families
was
fairly
settled
in
the
rest
of
them
were
not
slow
to
follow
the
benefits
of
the
change
were
so
evident
that
even
the
most
bigoted
believer
in
the
village
which
you
might
call
soulless
as
well
as
sunless
could
not
but
appreciate
them
the
final
decision
in
this
matter
which
gave
some
property
to
the
commune
in
the
possession
of
which
we
were
confirmed
by
the
council
of
state
made
me
a
person
of
great
importance
in
the
canton
but
what
a
lot
of
worry
there
was
over
it
the
doctor
remarked
stopping
short
and
raising
a
hand
which
he
let
fall
again
a
gesture
that
spoke
volumes
no
one
knows
as
i
do
the
distance
between
the
town
and
the
prefecture
whence
nothing
comes
out
and
from
the
prefecture
to
the
council
of
state
where
nothing
can
be
got
in
well
after
all
he
resumed
peace
be
to
the
powers
of
this
world
they
yielded
to
my
importunities
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
if
you
only
knew
the
good
that
came
of
a
carelessly
scrawled
signature
why
sir
two
years
after
i
had
taken
these
momentous
trifles
in
hand
and
had
carried
the
matter
through
to
the
end
every
poor
family
in
the
commune
had
two
cows
at
least
which
they
pastured
on
the
mountain
side
where
without
waiting
this
time
for
an
authorization
from
the
council
of
state
i
had
established
a
system
of
irrigation
by
means
of
cross
trenches
like
those
in
switzerland
auvergne
and
limousin
much
to
their
astonishment
the
townspeople
saw
some
capital
meadows
springing
up
under
their
eyes
and
thanks
to
the
improvement
in
the
pasturage
the
yield
of
milk
was
very
much
larger
the
results
of
this
triumph
were
great
indeed
every
one
followed
the
example
set
by
my
system
of
irrigation
cattle
were
multiplied
the
area
of
meadow
land
and
every
kind
of
increased
i
had
nothing
to
fear
after
that
i
could
continue
my
efforts
to
improve
this
as
yet
untilled
corner
of
the
earth
and
to
civilize
those
who
dwelt
in
it
whose
minds
had
hitherto
lain
dormant
well
sir
folk
like
us
who
live
out
of
the
world
are
very
talkative
if
you
ask
us
a
question
there
is
no
knowing
where
the
answer
will
come
to
an
end
but
to
cut
it
short
there
were
about
seven
hundred
souls
in
the
valley
when
i
came
to
it
and
now
the
population
numbers
some
two
thousand
i
had
gained
the
good
opinion
of
every
one
in
that
matter
of
the
last
cretin
and
when
i
had
constantly
shown
that
i
could
rule
both
mildly
and
firmly
i
became
a
local
oracle
i
did
everything
that
i
could
to
win
their
confidence
i
did
not
ask
for
it
nor
did
i
appear
to
seek
it
but
i
tried
to
inspire
every
one
with
the
deepest
respect
for
my
character
by
the
scrupulous
way
in
which
i
always
fulfilled
my
engagements
even
when
they
were
of
the
most
trifling
kind
when
i
had
pledged
myself
to
care
for
the
poor
creature
whose
death
you
have
just
witnessed
i
looked
after
him
much
more
effectually
than
any
of
his
previous
guardians
had
done
he
has
been
fed
and
cared
for
as
the
adopted
child
of
the
commune
after
a
time
the
dwellers
in
the
valley
ended
by
understanding
the
service
which
i
had
done
them
in
spite
of
themselves
but
for
all
that
they
still
cherish
some
traces
of
that
old
superstition
of
theirs
far
be
it
from
me
to
blame
them
for
it
has
not
their
cult
of
the
cretin
often
furnished
me
with
an
argument
when
i
have
tried
to
induce
those
who
had
possession
of
their
faculties
to
help
the
unfortunate
but
here
we
are
said
benassis
when
after
a
moment
s
pause
he
saw
the
roof
of
his
own
house
far
from
expecting
the
slightest
expression
of
praise
or
of
thanks
from
his
listener
it
appeared
from
his
way
of
telling
the
story
of
this
episode
in
his
administrative
career
that
he
had
been
moved
by
an
unconscious
desire
to
pour
out
the
thoughts
that
filled
his
mind
after
the
manner
of
folk
that
live
very
retired
lives
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
putting
my
horse
in
your
stable
sir
said
the
commandant
for
which
in
your
goodness
you
will
perhaps
pardon
me
when
you
learn
the
object
of
my
journey
ah
yes
what
is
it
asked
benassis
appearing
to
shake
off
his
preoccupied
mood
and
to
recollect
that
his
companion
was
a
stranger
to
him
the
frankness
and
unreserve
of
his
nature
had
led
him
to
accept
genestas
as
an
acquaintance
i
have
heard
of
the
almost
miraculous
recovery
of
gravier
of
grenoble
whom
you
received
into
your
house
was
the
soldier
s
answer
i
have
come
to
you
hoping
that
you
will
give
a
like
attention
to
my
case
although
i
have
not
a
similar
claim
to
your
benevolence
and
yet
i
am
possibly
not
undeserving
of
it
i
am
an
old
soldier
and
wounds
of
long
standing
give
me
no
peace
it
will
take
you
at
least
a
week
to
study
my
condition
for
the
pain
only
comes
back
at
intervals
and
very
good
sir
benassis
broke
in
m
gravier
s
room
is
in
readiness
come
they
went
into
the
house
the
doctor
flinging
open
the
door
with
an
eagerness
that
genestas
attributed
to
his
pleasure
at
receiving
a
boarder
jacquotte
benassis
called
out
this
gentleman
will
dine
with
but
would
it
not
be
as
well
for
us
to
settle
about
the
payment
payment
for
what
inquired
the
doctor
for
my
board
you
can
not
keep
me
and
my
horse
as
well
without
if
you
are
wealthy
you
will
repay
me
amply
benassis
replied
and
if
you
are
not
i
will
take
nothing
nothing
whatever
seems
to
me
to
be
too
dear
said
genestas
but
rich
or
poor
will
ten
francs
a
day
not
including
your
professional
services
be
acceptable
to
you
nothing
could
be
less
acceptable
to
me
than
payment
for
the
pleasure
of
entertaining
a
visitor
the
doctor
answered
knitting
his
brows
and
as
to
my
advice
you
shall
have
it
if
i
like
you
and
not
unless
rich
people
shall
not
have
my
time
by
paying
for
it
it
belongs
exclusively
to
the
folk
here
in
the
valley
i
do
not
care
about
fame
or
fortune
and
i
look
for
neither
praise
or
gratitude
from
my
patients
any
money
which
you
may
pay
me
will
go
to
the
druggists
in
grenoble
to
pay
for
the
medicine
required
by
the
poor
of
the
any
one
who
had
heard
the
words
flung
out
abruptly
it
is
true
but
without
a
trace
of
bitterness
in
them
would
have
said
to
himself
with
genestas
here
is
a
man
made
of
good
human
well
then
i
will
pay
you
ten
francs
a
day
sir
the
soldier
answered
returning
to
the
charge
with
wonted
pertinacity
and
you
will
do
as
you
choose
after
that
we
shall
understand
each
other
better
now
that
the
question
is
settled
he
added
grasping
the
doctor
s
hand
with
eager
cordiality
in
spite
of
my
ten
francs
you
shall
see
that
i
am
by
no
means
a
after
this
passage
of
arms
in
which
benassis
showed
not
the
slightest
sign
of
a
wish
to
appear
generous
or
to
pose
as
a
philanthropist
the
supposed
invalid
entered
his
doctor
s
house
everything
within
it
was
in
keeping
with
the
ruinous
state
of
the
gateway
and
with
the
clothing
worn
by
its
owner
there
was
an
utter
disregard
for
everything
not
essentially
useful
which
was
visible
even
in
the
smallest
trifles
benassis
took
genestas
through
the
kitchen
that
being
the
shortest
way
to
the
had
the
kitchen
belonged
to
an
inn
it
could
not
have
been
more
and
if
there
was
a
sufficiency
of
cooking
pots
within
its
precincts
this
lavish
supply
was
jacquotte
s
doing
jacquotte
who
had
formerly
been
the
cure
s
housekeeper
jacquotte
who
always
said
we
and
who
ruled
supreme
over
the
doctor
s
household
if
for
instance
there
was
a
brightly
polished
above
the
mantelshelf
it
probably
hung
there
because
jacquotte
liked
to
sleep
warm
of
a
winter
night
which
led
her
incidentally
to
warm
her
master
s
sheets
he
never
took
a
thought
about
anything
so
she
was
wont
to
say
it
was
on
account
of
a
defect
which
any
one
else
would
have
found
intolerable
that
benassis
had
taken
her
into
his
service
jacquotte
had
a
mind
to
rule
the
house
and
a
woman
who
would
rule
his
house
was
the
very
person
that
the
doctor
wanted
so
jacquotte
bought
and
sold
made
alterations
about
the
place
set
up
and
took
down
arranged
and
disarranged
everything
at
her
own
sweet
will
her
master
had
never
raised
a
murmur
over
the
yard
the
stable
the
and
the
kitchen
in
fact
over
the
whole
house
and
garden
and
its
master
jacquotte
s
sway
was
absolute
she
looked
out
fresh
linen
saw
to
the
washing
and
laid
in
provisions
without
consulting
anybody
she
decided
everything
that
went
on
in
the
house
and
the
date
when
the
pigs
were
to
be
killed
she
scolded
the
gardener
decreed
the
menu
at
breakfast
and
dinner
and
went
from
cellar
to
garret
and
from
garret
to
cellar
setting
everything
to
rights
according
to
her
notions
without
a
word
of
opposition
of
any
sort
or
description
benassis
had
made
but
two
stipulations
he
wished
to
dine
at
six
o
clock
and
that
the
household
expenses
should
not
exceed
a
certain
fixed
sum
every
month
a
woman
whom
every
one
obeys
in
this
way
is
always
singing
so
jacquotte
laughed
and
warbled
on
the
staircase
she
was
always
humming
something
when
she
was
not
singing
and
singing
when
she
was
not
humming
jacquotte
had
a
natural
liking
for
cleanliness
so
she
kept
the
house
neat
and
clean
if
her
tastes
had
been
different
it
would
have
been
a
sad
thing
for
benassis
so
she
was
wont
to
say
for
the
poor
man
was
so
little
particular
that
you
might
feed
him
on
cabbage
for
partridges
and
he
would
not
find
it
out
and
if
it
were
not
for
her
he
would
very
often
wear
the
same
shirt
for
a
week
on
end
jacquotte
however
was
an
indefatigable
folder
of
linen
a
born
rubber
and
polisher
of
furniture
and
a
passionate
lover
of
a
perfectly
religious
and
ceremonial
cleanliness
of
the
most
scrupulous
the
most
radiant
and
most
fragrant
kind
a
sworn
foe
to
dust
she
swept
and
scoured
and
washed
without
ceasing
the
condition
of
the
gateway
caused
her
acute
distress
on
the
first
day
of
every
month
for
the
past
ten
years
she
had
extorted
from
her
master
a
promise
that
he
would
replace
the
gate
with
a
new
one
that
the
walls
of
the
house
should
be
and
that
everything
should
be
made
quite
straight
and
proper
about
the
place
but
so
far
the
master
had
not
kept
his
word
so
it
happened
that
whenever
she
fell
to
lamenting
over
benassis
carelessness
about
things
she
nearly
always
ended
solemnly
in
these
words
with
which
all
her
praises
of
her
master
usually
terminated
you
can
not
say
that
he
is
a
fool
because
he
works
such
miracles
as
you
may
say
in
the
place
but
all
the
same
he
is
a
fool
at
times
such
a
fool
that
you
have
to
do
everything
for
him
as
if
he
were
a
jacquotte
loved
the
house
as
if
it
had
belonged
to
her
and
when
she
had
lived
in
it
for
years
had
she
not
some
grounds
for
deluding
herself
on
that
head
after
the
cure
s
death
the
house
had
been
for
sale
and
benassis
who
had
only
just
come
into
the
country
had
bought
it
as
it
stood
with
the
walls
about
it
and
the
ground
belonging
to
it
together
with
the
plate
wine
and
furniture
the
old
sundial
the
poultry
the
horse
and
the
jacquotte
was
the
very
pattern
of
a
working
housekeeper
with
her
clumsy
figure
and
her
bodice
always
of
the
same
dark
brown
print
with
large
red
spots
on
it
which
fitted
her
so
tightly
that
it
looked
as
if
the
material
must
give
way
if
she
moved
at
all
her
colorless
face
with
its
double
chin
looked
out
from
under
a
round
plaited
cap
which
made
her
look
paler
than
she
really
was
she
talked
incessantly
and
always
in
a
loud
voice
this
short
active
woman
with
the
plump
busy
hands
indeed
if
jacquotte
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
took
a
corner
of
her
apron
so
as
to
turn
it
up
in
a
triangle
it
meant
that
a
lengthy
expostulation
was
about
to
be
delivered
for
the
benefit
of
master
or
man
jacquotte
was
beyond
all
doubt
the
happiest
cook
in
the
kingdom
for
that
nothing
might
be
lacking
in
a
measure
of
felicity
as
great
as
may
be
known
in
this
world
below
her
vanity
was
continually
gratified
the
townspeople
regarded
her
as
an
authority
of
an
indefinite
kind
and
ranked
her
somewhere
between
the
mayor
and
the
the
master
of
the
house
found
nobody
in
the
kitchen
when
he
entered
it
where
the
devil
are
they
all
gone
he
asked
pardon
me
for
bringing
you
in
this
way
he
went
on
turning
to
genestas
the
front
entrance
opens
into
the
garden
but
i
am
so
little
accustomed
to
receive
visitors
that
jacquotte
he
called
in
rather
peremptory
tones
a
woman
s
voice
answered
to
the
name
from
the
interior
of
the
house
a
moment
later
jacquotte
assuming
the
offensive
called
in
her
turn
to
benassis
who
forthwith
went
into
the
just
like
you
sir
she
exclaimed
you
never
do
like
anybody
else
you
always
ask
people
to
dinner
without
telling
me
beforehand
and
you
think
that
everything
is
settled
as
soon
as
you
have
called
for
jacquotte
you
are
not
going
to
have
the
gentleman
sit
in
the
kitchen
are
you
is
not
the
salon
to
be
unlocked
and
a
fire
to
be
lighted
nicolle
is
there
and
will
see
after
everything
now
take
the
gentleman
into
the
garden
for
a
minute
that
will
amuse
him
if
he
likes
to
look
at
pretty
things
show
him
the
arbor
of
hornbeam
trees
that
the
poor
dear
old
gentleman
made
i
shall
have
time
then
to
lay
the
cloth
and
to
get
everything
ready
the
dinner
and
the
salon
yes
but
jacquotte
benassis
went
on
the
gentleman
is
going
to
stay
with
us
do
not
forget
to
give
a
look
round
gravier
s
room
and
see
about
the
sheets
and
things
and
now
you
are
not
going
to
interfere
about
the
sheets
are
you
asked
jacquotte
if
he
is
to
sleep
here
i
know
what
must
be
done
for
him
perfectly
well
you
have
not
so
much
as
set
foot
in
gravier
s
room
these
ten
months
past
there
is
nothing
to
see
there
the
place
is
as
clean
as
a
new
pin
then
will
the
gentleman
make
some
stay
here
she
continued
in
a
milder
tone
how
long
will
he
stay
faith
i
do
not
know
what
does
it
matter
to
you
what
does
it
matter
to
me
sir
oh
very
well
what
does
it
matter
to
me
did
any
one
ever
hear
the
like
and
the
provisions
and
all
that
and
at
any
other
time
she
would
have
overwhelmed
her
master
with
reproaches
for
his
breach
of
trust
but
now
she
followed
him
into
the
kitchen
before
the
torrent
of
words
had
come
to
an
end
she
had
guessed
that
there
was
a
prospect
of
a
boarder
and
was
eager
to
see
genestas
to
whom
she
made
a
very
deferential
courtesy
while
she
scanned
him
from
head
to
foot
a
thoughtful
and
dejected
expression
gave
a
harsh
look
to
the
soldier
s
face
in
the
dialogue
between
master
and
servant
the
latter
had
appeared
to
him
in
the
light
of
a
nonentity
and
although
he
regretted
the
fact
this
revelation
had
lessened
the
high
opinion
that
he
had
formed
of
the
man
whose
persistent
efforts
to
save
the
district
from
the
horrors
of
cretinism
had
won
his
admiration
i
do
not
like
the
looks
of
that
fellow
at
all
said
jacquotte
to
herself
if
you
are
not
tired
sir
said
the
doctor
to
his
supposed
patient
we
will
take
a
turn
round
the
garden
before
willingly
answered
the
commandant
they
went
through
the
and
reached
the
garden
by
way
of
a
sort
of
vestibule
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
between
the
salon
and
the
beyond
a
great
glass
door
at
the
farther
end
of
the
vestibule
lay
a
flight
of
stone
steps
which
adorned
the
garden
side
of
the
house
the
garden
itself
was
divided
into
four
large
squares
of
equal
size
by
two
paths
that
intersected
each
other
in
the
form
of
a
cross
a
box
edging
along
their
sides
at
the
farther
end
there
was
a
thick
green
alley
of
hornbeam
trees
which
had
been
the
joy
and
pride
of
the
late
owner
the
soldier
seated
himself
on
a
bench
and
saw
neither
the
nor
the
espaliers
nor
the
vegetables
of
which
jacquotte
took
such
great
care
she
followed
the
traditions
of
the
epicurean
churchman
to
whom
this
valuable
garden
owed
its
origin
but
benassis
himself
regarded
it
with
sufficient
indifference
the
commandant
turned
their
talk
from
the
trivial
matters
which
had
occupied
them
by
saying
to
the
doctor
how
comes
it
sir
that
the
population
of
the
valley
has
been
trebled
in
ten
years
there
were
seven
hundred
souls
in
it
when
you
came
and
you
say
that
they
number
more
than
two
you
are
the
first
person
who
has
put
that
question
to
me
the
doctor
answered
though
it
has
been
my
aim
to
develop
the
capabilities
of
this
little
corner
of
the
earth
to
the
utmost
the
constant
pressure
of
a
busy
life
has
not
left
me
time
to
think
over
the
way
in
which
like
the
mendicant
brother
i
have
made
broth
from
a
flint
on
a
large
scale
gravier
himself
who
is
one
of
several
who
have
done
a
great
deal
for
us
and
to
whom
i
was
able
to
render
a
service
by
his
health
has
never
given
a
thought
to
the
theory
though
he
has
been
everywhere
over
our
mountain
sides
with
me
to
see
its
practical
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
during
which
benassis
followed
his
own
thoughts
careless
of
the
keen
glance
by
which
his
guest
friend
tried
to
fathom
him
you
ask
how
it
came
about
my
dear
sir
the
doctor
resumed
it
came
about
quite
naturally
through
the
working
of
the
social
law
by
which
the
need
and
the
means
of
supplying
it
are
correlated
herein
lies
the
whole
story
races
who
have
no
wants
are
always
poor
when
i
first
came
to
live
here
in
this
township
there
were
about
a
hundred
and
thirty
peasant
families
in
it
and
some
two
hundred
hearths
in
the
valley
the
local
authorities
were
such
as
might
be
expected
in
the
prevailing
wretchedness
of
the
population
the
mayor
himself
could
not
write
and
the
was
a
small
farmer
who
lived
beyond
the
limits
of
the
commune
the
justice
of
the
peace
was
a
poor
devil
who
had
nothing
but
his
salary
and
who
was
forced
to
relinquish
the
registration
of
births
marriages
and
deaths
to
his
clerk
another
hapless
wretch
who
was
scarcely
able
to
understand
his
duties
the
old
cure
had
died
at
the
age
of
seventy
and
his
curate
a
quite
uneducated
man
had
just
succeeded
to
his
position
these
people
comprised
all
the
intelligence
of
the
district
over
which
they
ruled
those
who
dwelt
amidst
these
lovely
natural
surroundings
groveled
in
squalor
and
lived
upon
potatoes
milk
butter
and
cheese
the
only
produce
that
brought
in
any
money
was
the
cheese
which
most
of
them
carried
in
small
baskets
to
grenoble
or
its
outskirts
the
richer
or
the
more
energetic
among
them
sowed
buckwheat
for
home
consumption
sometimes
they
raised
a
crop
of
barley
or
oats
but
wheat
was
unknown
the
only
trader
in
the
place
was
the
mayor
who
owned
a
sawmill
and
bought
up
timber
at
a
low
price
to
sell
again
in
the
absence
of
roads
his
tree
trunks
had
to
be
transported
during
the
summer
season
each
log
was
dragged
along
one
at
a
time
and
with
no
small
difficulty
by
means
of
a
chain
attached
to
a
halter
about
his
horse
s
neck
and
an
iron
hook
at
the
farther
end
of
the
chain
which
was
driven
into
the
wood
any
one
who
went
to
grenoble
whether
on
horseback
or
afoot
was
obliged
to
follow
a
track
high
up
on
the
mountain
side
for
the
valley
was
quite
impassable
the
pretty
road
between
this
place
and
the
first
village
that
you
reach
as
you
come
into
the
canton
the
way
along
which
you
must
have
come
was
nothing
but
a
slough
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
political
events
and
revolutions
had
never
reached
this
inaccessible
country
it
lay
completely
beyond
the
limits
of
social
stir
and
change
napoleon
s
name
and
his
alone
had
penetrated
hither
he
is
held
in
great
veneration
thanks
to
one
or
two
old
soldiers
who
have
returned
to
their
native
homes
and
who
of
evenings
tell
marvelous
tales
about
his
adventures
and
his
armies
for
the
benefit
of
these
simple
folk
their
coming
back
is
moreover
a
puzzle
that
no
one
can
explain
before
i
came
here
the
young
men
who
went
into
the
army
all
stayed
in
it
for
good
this
fact
in
itself
is
a
sufficient
revelation
of
the
wretched
condition
of
the
country
i
need
not
give
you
a
detailed
description
of
it
this
then
was
the
state
of
things
when
i
first
came
to
the
canton
which
has
several
contented
and
fairly
prosperous
communes
belonging
to
it
upon
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
i
will
say
nothing
about
the
hovels
in
the
town
they
were
neither
more
nor
less
than
stables
in
which
men
and
animals
were
indiscriminately
huddled
together
as
there
was
no
inn
in
the
place
i
was
obliged
to
ask
the
curate
for
a
bed
he
being
in
possession
for
the
time
being
of
this
house
then
offered
for
sale
putting
to
him
question
after
question
i
came
to
have
some
slight
knowledge
of
the
lamentable
condition
of
the
country
with
the
pleasant
climate
the
fertile
soil
and
the
natural
productiveness
that
had
impressed
me
so
much
at
that
time
sir
i
was
seeking
to
shape
a
future
for
myself
that
should
be
as
little
as
possible
like
the
troubled
life
that
had
left
me
weary
and
one
of
those
thoughts
came
into
my
mind
that
god
gives
us
at
times
to
enable
us
to
take
up
our
burdens
and
bear
them
i
resolved
to
develop
all
the
resources
of
this
country
just
as
a
tutor
develops
the
capacities
of
a
child
do
not
think
too
much
of
my
benevolence
the
pressing
need
that
i
felt
for
turning
my
thoughts
into
fresh
channels
entered
too
much
into
my
motives
i
had
determined
to
give
up
the
remainder
of
my
life
to
some
difficult
task
a
lifetime
would
be
required
to
bring
about
the
needful
changes
in
a
canton
that
nature
had
made
so
wealthy
and
man
so
poor
and
i
was
tempted
by
the
practical
difficulties
that
stood
in
the
way
as
soon
as
i
found
that
i
could
secure
the
cure
s
house
and
plenty
of
waste
land
at
a
small
cost
i
solemnly
devoted
myself
to
the
calling
of
a
country
surgeon
the
very
last
position
that
a
man
aspires
to
take
i
determined
to
become
the
friend
of
the
poor
and
to
expect
no
reward
of
any
kind
from
them
oh
i
did
not
indulge
in
any
illusions
as
to
the
nature
of
the
country
people
nor
as
to
the
hindrances
that
lie
in
the
way
of
every
attempt
to
bring
about
a
better
state
of
things
among
men
or
their
surroundings
i
have
never
made
idyllic
pictures
of
my
people
i
have
taken
them
at
their
just
worth
as
poor
peasants
neither
wholly
good
nor
wholly
bad
whose
constant
toil
never
allows
them
to
indulge
in
emotion
though
they
can
feel
acutely
at
times
above
all
things
in
fact
i
clearly
understood
that
i
should
do
nothing
with
them
except
through
an
appeal
to
their
selfish
interests
and
by
schemes
for
their
immediate
the
peasants
are
one
and
all
the
sons
of
thomas
the
doubting
apostle
they
always
like
words
to
be
supported
by
visible
facts
perhaps
you
will
laugh
at
my
first
start
sir
the
doctor
went
on
after
a
pause
i
began
my
difficult
enterprise
by
introducing
the
manufacture
of
baskets
the
poor
folks
used
to
buy
the
wicker
mats
on
which
they
drain
their
cheeses
and
all
the
baskets
needed
for
the
insignificant
trade
of
the
district
i
suggested
to
an
intelligent
young
fellow
that
he
might
take
a
lease
on
a
piece
of
land
by
the
side
of
the
torrent
every
year
the
floods
deposited
a
rich
alluvial
soil
on
this
spot
where
there
should
be
no
difficulty
in
growing
osiers
i
reckoned
out
the
quantity
of
of
various
kinds
required
from
time
to
time
by
the
canton
and
went
over
to
grenoble
where
i
found
a
young
craftsman
a
clever
worker
but
without
any
capital
when
i
had
discovered
him
i
soon
made
up
my
mind
to
set
him
up
in
business
here
i
undertook
to
advance
the
money
for
the
osiers
required
for
his
work
until
my
should
be
in
a
position
to
supply
him
i
induced
him
to
sell
his
baskets
at
rather
lower
prices
than
they
asked
for
them
in
grenoble
while
at
the
same
time
they
were
better
made
he
entered
into
my
views
completely
the
and
the
were
two
business
speculations
whose
results
were
only
appreciated
after
a
lapse
of
four
years
of
course
you
know
that
osiers
must
be
three
years
old
before
they
are
fit
to
cut
at
the
commencement
of
operations
the
was
boarded
and
lodged
gratuitously
before
very
long
he
married
a
woman
from
saint
laurent
du
pont
who
had
a
little
money
then
he
had
a
house
built
in
a
healthy
and
very
airy
situation
which
i
chose
and
my
advice
was
followed
as
to
the
internal
arrangements
here
was
a
triumph
i
had
created
a
new
industry
and
had
brought
a
producer
and
several
workers
into
the
town
i
wonder
if
you
will
regard
my
elations
as
childish
for
the
first
few
days
after
my
had
set
up
his
business
i
never
went
past
his
shop
but
my
heart
beat
somewhat
faster
and
when
i
saw
the
house
with
the
shutters
the
vine
beside
the
doorway
and
the
bench
and
bundles
of
osiers
before
it
when
i
saw
a
tidy
woman
within
it
nursing
a
plump
pink
and
white
baby
among
the
workmen
who
were
singing
merrily
and
busily
plaiting
their
under
the
superintendence
of
a
man
who
but
lately
had
looked
so
pinched
and
pale
but
now
had
an
atmosphere
of
prosperity
about
him
when
i
saw
all
this
i
confess
that
i
could
not
forego
the
pleasure
of
turning
for
a
moment
of
going
into
the
shop
to
hear
how
things
went
with
them
and
of
giving
myself
up
to
a
feeling
of
content
that
i
can
not
express
in
words
for
i
had
all
their
happiness
as
well
as
my
own
to
make
me
glad
all
my
hopes
became
centered
on
this
house
where
the
man
dwelt
who
had
been
the
first
to
put
a
steady
faith
in
me
like
the
s
wife
clasping
her
first
nursling
to
her
breast
did
not
i
already
fondly
cherish
the
hopes
of
the
future
of
this
poor
district
i
had
to
do
so
many
things
at
once
he
went
on
i
came
into
collision
with
other
people
s
notions
and
met
with
violent
opposition
fomented
by
the
ignorant
mayor
to
whose
office
i
had
succeeded
and
whose
influence
had
dwindled
away
as
mine
increased
i
determined
to
make
him
my
deputy
and
a
confederate
in
my
schemes
of
benevolence
yes
in
the
first
place
i
endeavored
to
instil
enlightened
ideas
into
the
densest
of
all
heads
through
his
and
cupidity
i
gained
a
hold
upon
my
man
during
six
months
as
we
dined
together
i
took
him
deeply
into
my
confidence
about
my
projected
improvements
many
people
would
think
this
intimacy
one
of
the
most
painful
inflictions
in
the
course
of
my
task
but
was
he
not
a
tool
of
the
most
valuable
kind
woe
to
him
who
despises
his
axe
or
flings
it
carelessly
aside
would
it
not
have
been
very
inconsistent
moreover
if
i
who
wished
to
improve
a
district
had
shrunk
back
at
the
thought
of
improving
one
man
in
it
a
road
was
our
first
and
most
pressing
need
in
bringing
about
a
better
state
of
things
if
we
could
obtain
permission
from
the
municipal
council
to
make
a
hard
road
so
as
to
put
us
in
communication
with
the
highway
to
grenoble
the
would
be
the
first
gainer
by
it
for
instead
of
dragging
his
timber
over
rough
tracks
at
a
great
expense
a
good
road
through
the
canton
would
enable
him
to
transport
it
more
easily
and
to
engage
in
a
traffic
on
a
large
scale
in
all
kinds
of
wood
that
would
bring
in
money
not
a
miserable
six
hundred
francs
a
year
but
handsome
sums
which
would
mean
a
certain
fortune
for
him
some
day
convinced
at
last
he
became
my
proselytizer
through
the
whole
of
one
winter
the
got
into
the
way
of
explaining
to
our
citizens
that
a
good
road
for
wheeled
traffic
would
be
a
source
of
wealth
to
the
whole
country
round
for
it
would
enable
every
one
to
do
a
trade
with
grenoble
he
held
forth
on
this
head
at
the
tavern
while
drinking
with
his
intimates
when
the
municipal
council
had
authorized
the
making
of
the
road
i
went
to
the
prefect
and
obtained
some
money
from
the
charitable
funds
at
the
disposal
of
the
department
in
order
to
pay
for
the
hire
of
carts
for
the
commune
was
unable
to
undertake
the
transport
of
road
metal
for
lack
of
wheeled
conveyances
the
ignorant
began
to
murmur
against
me
and
to
say
that
i
wanted
to
bring
the
days
of
the
corvee
back
again
this
made
me
anxious
to
finish
this
important
work
that
they
might
speedily
appreciate
its
benefits
with
this
end
in
view
every
sunday
during
my
first
year
of
office
i
drew
the
whole
population
of
the
township
willing
or
unwilling
up
on
to
the
mountain
where
i
myself
had
traced
out
on
a
hard
bottom
the
road
between
our
village
and
the
highway
to
grenoble
materials
for
making
it
were
fortunately
to
be
had
in
plenty
along
the
site
the
tedious
enterprise
called
for
a
great
deal
of
patience
on
my
part
some
who
were
ignorant
of
the
law
would
refuse
at
times
to
give
their
contribution
of
labor
others
again
who
had
not
bread
to
eat
really
could
not
afford
to
lose
a
day
corn
had
to
be
distributed
among
these
last
and
the
others
must
be
soothed
with
friendly
words
yet
by
the
time
we
had
finished
of
the
road
which
in
all
is
about
two
leagues
in
length
the
people
had
so
thoroughly
recognized
its
advantages
that
the
remaining
third
was
accomplished
with
a
spirit
that
surprised
me
i
added
to
the
future
wealth
of
the
commune
by
planting
a
double
row
of
poplars
along
the
ditch
on
either
side
of
the
way
the
trees
are
already
almost
worth
a
fortune
and
they
make
our
road
look
like
a
king
s
highway
it
is
almost
always
dry
by
reason
of
its
position
and
it
was
so
well
made
that
the
annual
cost
of
maintaining
it
is
a
bare
two
hundred
francs
i
must
show
it
to
you
for
you
can
not
have
seen
it
you
must
have
come
by
the
picturesque
way
along
the
valley
bottom
a
road
which
the
people
decided
to
make
for
themselves
three
years
later
so
as
to
connect
the
various
farms
that
were
made
there
at
that
time
in
three
years
ideas
had
rooted
themselves
in
the
common
sense
of
this
township
hitherto
so
lacking
in
intelligence
that
a
passing
traveler
would
perhaps
have
thought
it
hopeless
to
attempt
to
instil
them
but
to
continue
the
establishment
of
the
was
an
example
set
before
these
folk
that
they
might
profit
by
it
and
if
the
road
was
to
be
a
direct
cause
of
the
future
wealth
of
the
canton
all
the
primary
forms
of
industry
must
be
stimulated
or
these
two
germs
of
a
better
state
of
things
would
come
to
nothing
my
own
work
went
forward
by
slow
degrees
as
i
helped
my
osier
farmer
and
and
saw
to
the
making
of
the
road
i
had
two
horses
and
the
timber
merchant
the
had
three
he
could
only
have
them
shod
whenever
he
went
over
to
grenoble
so
i
induced
a
farrier
to
take
up
his
abode
here
and
undertook
to
find
him
plenty
of
work
on
the
same
day
i
met
with
a
discharged
soldier
who
had
nothing
but
his
pension
of
a
hundred
francs
and
was
sufficiently
perplexed
about
his
future
he
could
read
and
write
so
i
engaged
him
as
secretary
to
the
mayor
as
it
happened
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
a
wife
for
him
and
his
dreams
of
happiness
were
fulfilled
both
of
these
new
families
needed
houses
as
well
as
the
and
others
from
the
cretin
village
soon
afterwards
twelve
more
households
were
established
in
the
place
the
workers
in
each
of
these
families
were
at
once
producers
and
consumers
they
were
masons
carpenters
joiners
slaters
blacksmiths
and
glaziers
and
there
was
work
enough
to
last
them
for
a
long
time
for
had
they
not
their
own
houses
to
build
when
they
had
finished
those
for
other
people
seventy
in
fact
were
build
in
the
commune
during
my
second
year
of
office
one
form
of
production
demands
another
the
additions
to
the
population
of
the
township
had
created
fresh
wants
hitherto
unknown
among
these
dwellers
in
poverty
the
wants
gave
rise
to
industries
and
industries
to
trade
and
the
gains
of
trade
raised
the
standard
of
comfort
which
in
its
turn
gave
them
practical
ideas
the
various
workmen
wished
to
buy
their
bread
ready
baked
so
we
came
to
have
a
baker
buckwheat
could
no
longer
be
the
food
of
a
population
which
awakened
from
its
lethargy
had
become
essentially
active
they
lived
on
buckwheat
when
i
first
came
among
them
and
i
wished
to
effect
a
change
to
rye
or
a
mixture
of
rye
and
wheat
in
the
first
instance
and
finally
to
see
a
loaf
of
white
bread
even
in
the
poorest
household
intellectual
progress
to
my
thinking
was
entirely
dependent
on
a
general
improvement
in
the
conditions
of
life
the
presence
of
a
butcher
in
the
district
says
as
much
for
its
intelligence
as
for
its
wealth
the
worker
feeds
himself
and
a
man
who
feeds
himself
thinks
i
had
made
a
very
careful
study
of
the
soil
for
i
foresaw
a
time
when
it
would
be
necessary
to
grow
wheat
i
was
sure
of
launching
the
place
in
a
very
prosperous
agricultural
career
and
of
doubling
the
population
when
once
it
had
begun
to
work
and
now
the
time
had
come
m
gravier
of
grenoble
owned
a
great
deal
of
land
in
the
commune
which
brought
him
in
no
rent
but
which
might
be
turned
into
land
he
is
the
head
of
a
department
in
the
prefecture
as
you
know
it
was
a
kindness
for
his
own
countryside
quite
as
much
as
my
earnest
entreaties
that
won
him
over
he
had
very
benevolently
yielded
to
my
importunities
on
former
occasions
and
i
succeeded
in
making
it
clear
to
him
that
in
so
doing
he
had
wrought
unconsciously
for
his
own
benefit
after
several
days
spent
in
pleadings
consultation
and
talk
the
matter
was
thrashed
out
i
undertook
to
guarantee
him
against
all
risks
in
the
undertaking
from
which
his
wife
a
woman
of
no
imagination
sought
to
frighten
him
he
agreed
to
build
four
farmhouses
with
a
hundred
acres
of
land
attached
to
each
and
promised
to
advance
the
sums
required
to
pay
for
clearing
the
ground
for
seeds
ploughing
gear
and
cattle
and
for
making
occupation
roads
i
myself
also
started
two
farms
quite
as
much
for
the
sake
of
bringing
my
waste
land
into
cultivation
as
with
a
view
to
giving
an
in
the
use
of
modern
methods
in
agriculture
in
six
weeks
time
the
population
of
the
town
increased
to
three
hundred
people
homes
for
several
families
must
be
built
on
the
six
farms
there
was
a
vast
quantity
of
land
to
be
broken
up
the
work
called
for
laborers
wheelwrights
drainmakers
journeymen
and
laborers
of
all
kinds
flocked
in
the
road
to
grenoble
was
covered
with
carts
that
came
and
went
all
the
countryside
was
astir
the
circulation
of
money
had
made
every
one
anxious
to
earn
it
apathy
had
ceased
the
place
had
awakened
the
story
of
gravier
one
of
those
who
did
so
much
for
this
canton
can
be
concluded
in
a
few
words
in
spite
of
cautious
misgivings
not
unnatural
in
a
man
occupying
an
official
position
in
a
provincial
town
he
advanced
more
than
forty
thousand
francs
on
the
faith
of
my
promises
without
knowing
whether
he
should
ever
see
them
back
again
every
one
of
his
farms
is
let
for
a
thousand
francs
his
tenants
have
thriven
so
well
that
each
of
them
owns
at
least
a
hundred
acres
three
hundred
sheep
twenty
cows
ten
oxen
and
five
horses
and
employs
more
than
twenty
persons
but
to
resume
our
farms
were
ready
by
the
end
of
the
fourth
year
our
wheat
harvest
seemed
miraculous
to
the
people
in
the
district
heavy
as
the
first
crop
off
the
land
ought
to
be
how
often
during
that
year
i
trembled
for
the
success
of
my
work
rain
or
drought
might
spoil
everything
by
diminishing
the
belief
in
me
that
was
already
felt
when
we
began
to
grow
wheat
it
necessitated
the
mill
that
you
have
seen
which
brings
me
in
about
five
hundred
francs
a
year
so
the
peasants
say
that
there
is
luck
about
me
that
is
the
way
they
put
it
and
believe
in
me
as
they
believe
in
their
relics
these
new
undertakings
the
farms
the
mill
the
plantations
and
the
roads
have
given
employment
to
all
the
various
kinds
of
workers
whom
i
had
called
in
although
the
buildings
fully
represent
the
value
of
the
sixty
thousand
francs
of
capital
which
we
sunk
in
the
district
the
outlay
was
more
than
returned
to
us
by
the
profits
on
the
sales
which
the
consumers
occasioned
i
never
ceased
my
efforts
to
put
vigor
into
this
industrial
life
which
was
just
beginning
a
nurseryman
took
my
advice
and
came
to
settle
in
the
place
and
i
preached
wholesome
doctrine
to
the
poor
concerning
the
planting
of
fruit
trees
in
order
that
some
day
they
should
obtain
a
monopoly
of
the
sale
of
fruit
in
grenoble
you
take
your
cheeses
there
as
it
is
i
used
to
tell
them
why
not
take
poultry
eggs
vegetables
game
hay
and
straw
and
so
forth
all
my
counsels
were
a
source
of
fortune
it
was
a
question
of
who
should
follow
them
first
a
number
of
little
businesses
were
started
they
went
on
at
first
but
slowly
but
from
day
to
day
their
progress
became
more
rapid
and
now
sixty
carts
full
of
the
various
products
of
the
district
set
out
every
monday
for
grenoble
and
there
is
more
buckwheat
grown
for
poultry
food
than
they
used
to
sow
for
human
consumption
the
trade
in
timber
grew
to
be
so
considerable
that
it
was
subdivided
and
since
the
fourth
year
of
our
industrial
era
we
have
had
dealers
in
firewood
squared
timber
planks
bark
and
later
on
in
charcoal
in
the
end
four
new
sawmills
were
set
up
to
turn
out
the
planks
and
beams
of
timber
when
the
had
acquired
a
few
business
notions
he
felt
the
necessity
of
learning
to
read
and
write
he
compared
the
prices
that
were
asked
for
wood
in
various
neighborhoods
and
found
such
differences
in
his
favor
that
he
secured
new
customers
in
one
place
after
another
and
now
a
third
of
the
trade
in
the
department
passes
through
his
hands
there
has
been
such
a
sudden
increase
in
our
traffic
that
we
find
constant
work
for
three
and
two
each
of
them
employing
three
hands
at
least
lastly
the
quantity
of
ironware
that
we
use
is
so
large
that
an
agricultural
implement
and
has
removed
into
the
town
and
is
very
well
satisfied
with
the
result
the
desire
of
gain
develops
a
spirit
of
ambition
which
has
ever
since
impelled
our
workers
to
extend
their
field
from
the
township
to
the
canton
and
from
the
canton
to
the
department
so
as
to
increase
their
profits
by
increasing
their
sales
i
had
only
to
say
a
word
to
point
out
new
openings
to
them
and
their
own
sense
did
the
rest
four
years
had
been
sufficient
to
change
the
face
of
the
township
when
i
had
come
through
it
first
i
did
not
catch
the
slightest
sound
but
in
less
than
five
years
from
that
time
there
was
life
and
bustle
everywhere
the
gay
songs
the
shrill
or
murmuring
sounds
made
by
the
tools
in
the
workshops
rang
pleasantly
in
my
ears
i
watched
the
comings
and
goings
of
a
busy
population
congregated
in
the
clean
and
wholesome
new
town
where
plenty
of
trees
had
been
planted
every
one
of
them
seemed
conscious
of
a
happy
lot
every
face
shone
with
the
content
that
comes
through
a
life
of
useful
toil
i
look
upon
these
five
years
as
the
first
epoch
of
prosperity
in
the
history
of
our
town
the
doctor
went
on
after
a
pause
during
that
time
i
have
prepared
the
ground
and
sowed
the
seed
in
men
s
minds
as
well
as
in
the
land
henceforward
industrial
progress
could
not
be
stayed
the
population
was
bound
to
go
forward
a
second
epoch
was
about
to
begin
this
little
world
very
soon
desired
to
be
better
clad
a
shoemaker
came
and
with
him
a
haberdasher
a
tailor
and
a
hatter
this
dawn
of
luxury
brought
us
a
butcher
and
a
grocer
and
a
midwife
who
became
very
necessary
to
me
for
i
lost
a
great
deal
of
time
over
maternity
cases
the
stubbed
wastes
yielded
excellent
harvests
and
the
superior
quality
of
our
agricultural
produce
was
maintained
through
the
increased
supply
of
manure
my
enterprise
could
now
develop
itself
everything
followed
on
quite
naturally
when
the
houses
had
been
rendered
wholesome
and
their
inmates
gradually
persuaded
to
feed
and
clothe
themselves
better
i
wanted
the
dumb
animals
to
feel
the
benefit
of
these
beginnings
of
civilization
all
the
excellence
of
cattle
whether
as
a
race
or
as
individuals
and
in
consequence
the
quality
of
the
milk
and
meat
depends
upon
the
care
that
is
expended
upon
them
i
took
the
sanitation
of
cowsheds
for
the
text
of
my
sermons
i
showed
them
how
an
animal
that
is
properly
housed
and
well
cared
for
is
more
profitable
than
a
lean
neglected
beast
and
the
comparison
wrought
a
gradual
change
for
the
better
in
the
lot
of
the
cattle
in
the
commune
not
one
of
them
was
ill
treated
the
cows
and
oxen
were
rubbed
down
as
in
switzerland
and
auvergne
stables
byres
dairies
and
barns
were
rebuilt
after
the
pattern
of
the
roomy
and
consequently
healthy
steadings
that
gravier
and
i
had
constructed
our
tenants
became
my
apostles
they
made
rapid
converts
of
unbelievers
demonstrating
the
soundness
of
my
doctrines
by
their
prompt
results
i
lent
money
to
those
who
needed
it
giving
the
preference
to
hardworking
poor
people
because
they
served
as
an
example
any
unsound
or
sickly
cattle
or
beasts
of
poor
quality
were
quickly
disposed
of
by
my
advice
and
replaced
by
fine
specimens
in
this
way
our
dairy
produce
came
in
time
to
command
higher
prices
in
the
market
than
that
sent
by
other
communes
we
had
splendid
herds
and
as
a
consequence
capital
leather
this
step
forward
was
of
great
importance
and
in
this
wise
in
rural
economy
nothing
can
be
regarded
as
trifling
our
hides
used
to
fetch
scarcely
anything
and
the
leather
we
made
was
of
little
value
but
when
once
our
leather
and
hides
were
improved
tanneries
were
easily
established
along
the
waterside
we
became
tanners
and
business
rapidly
increased
wine
properly
speaking
had
been
hitherto
unknown
a
thin
sour
beverage
like
verjuice
had
been
their
only
drink
but
now
wineshops
were
established
to
supply
a
natural
demand
the
oldest
tavern
was
enlarged
and
transformed
into
an
inn
which
furnished
mules
to
pilgrims
to
the
grand
chartreuse
who
began
to
come
our
way
and
after
two
years
there
was
just
enough
business
for
two
innkeepers
the
justice
of
the
peace
died
just
as
our
second
prosperous
epoch
began
and
luckily
for
us
his
successor
had
formerly
been
a
notary
in
grenoble
who
had
lost
most
of
his
fortune
by
a
bad
speculation
though
enough
of
it
yet
remained
to
cause
him
to
be
looked
upon
in
the
village
as
a
wealthy
man
it
was
gravier
who
induced
him
to
settle
among
us
he
built
himself
a
comfortable
house
and
helped
me
by
uniting
his
efforts
to
mine
he
also
laid
out
a
farm
and
broke
up
and
cleaned
some
of
the
waste
land
and
at
this
moment
he
has
three
chalets
up
above
on
the
mountain
side
he
has
a
large
family
he
dismissed
the
old
registrar
and
the
clerk
and
in
their
place
installed
men
who
worked
far
harder
moreover
than
their
predecessors
had
done
one
of
the
heads
of
these
two
new
households
started
a
distillery
of
and
the
other
was
a
each
combined
these
occupations
with
his
official
work
and
in
this
way
two
valuable
industries
were
created
among
us
now
that
the
commune
had
some
revenues
of
its
own
no
opposition
was
raised
in
any
quarter
when
they
were
spent
on
building
a
with
a
free
school
for
elementary
education
in
the
building
and
accommodation
for
a
teacher
for
this
important
post
i
had
selected
a
poor
priest
who
had
taken
the
oath
and
had
therefore
been
cast
out
by
the
department
and
who
at
last
found
a
refuge
among
us
for
his
old
age
the
schoolmistress
is
a
very
worthy
woman
who
had
lost
all
that
she
had
and
was
in
great
distress
we
made
up
a
nice
little
sum
for
her
and
she
has
just
opened
a
for
girls
to
which
the
wealthy
farmers
hereabouts
are
beginning
to
send
their
daughters
if
so
far
sir
i
have
been
entitled
to
tell
you
the
story
of
my
own
doings
as
the
chronicle
of
this
little
spot
of
earth
i
have
reached
the
point
where
janvier
the
new
parson
began
to
divide
the
work
of
regeneration
with
me
he
has
been
a
second
fenelon
unknown
beyond
the
narrow
limits
of
a
country
parish
and
by
some
secret
of
his
own
has
infused
a
spirit
of
brotherliness
and
of
charity
among
these
folk
that
has
made
them
almost
like
one
large
family
dufau
the
justice
of
the
peace
was
a
late
comer
but
he
in
an
equal
degree
deserves
the
gratitude
of
the
people
here
i
will
put
the
whole
position
before
you
in
figures
that
will
make
it
clearer
than
any
words
of
mine
at
this
moment
the
commune
owns
two
hundred
acres
of
woodland
and
a
hundred
and
sixty
acres
of
meadow
without
running
up
the
rates
we
give
a
hundred
crowns
to
supplement
the
cure
s
stipend
we
pay
two
hundred
francs
to
the
rural
policeman
and
as
much
again
to
the
schoolmaster
and
schoolmistress
the
maintenance
of
the
roads
costs
us
five
hundred
francs
while
necessary
repairs
to
the
townhall
the
parsonage
and
the
church
with
some
few
other
expenses
also
amount
to
a
similar
sum
in
fifteen
years
time
there
will
be
a
thousand
francs
worth
of
wood
to
fell
for
every
hundred
francs
worth
cut
now
and
the
taxes
will
not
cost
the
inhabitants
a
penny
this
commune
is
bound
to
become
one
of
the
richest
in
france
but
perhaps
i
am
taxing
your
patience
sir
said
benassis
suddenly
discovering
that
his
companion
wore
such
a
pensive
expression
that
it
seemed
as
though
his
attention
was
wandering
no
no
answered
the
commandant
our
trade
handicrafts
and
agriculture
so
far
only
supplied
the
needs
of
the
district
the
doctor
went
on
at
a
certain
point
our
prosperity
came
to
a
standstill
i
wanted
a
and
sellers
of
tobacco
stationery
powder
and
shot
the
receiver
of
taxes
had
hitherto
preferred
to
live
elsewhere
but
now
i
succeeded
in
persuading
him
to
take
up
his
abode
in
the
town
holding
out
as
inducements
the
pleasantness
of
the
place
and
of
the
new
society
as
time
and
place
permitted
i
had
succeeded
in
producing
a
supply
of
everything
for
which
i
had
first
created
a
need
in
attracting
families
of
hardworking
people
into
the
district
and
in
implanting
a
desire
to
own
land
in
them
all
so
by
degrees
as
they
saved
a
little
money
the
waste
land
began
to
be
broken
up
spade
husbandry
and
small
holdings
increased
so
did
the
value
of
property
on
the
mountain
those
struggling
folk
who
when
i
knew
them
first
used
to
walk
over
to
grenoble
carrying
their
few
cheeses
for
sale
now
made
the
journey
comfortably
in
a
cart
and
took
fruit
eggs
chickens
and
turkeys
and
before
they
were
aware
of
it
everyone
was
a
little
richer
even
those
who
came
off
worst
had
a
garden
at
any
rate
and
grew
early
vegetables
and
fruit
it
became
the
children
s
work
to
watch
the
cattle
in
the
fields
and
at
last
it
was
found
to
be
a
waste
of
time
to
bake
bread
at
home
here
were
signs
of
prosperity
but
if
this
place
was
to
be
a
permanent
forge
of
industry
fuel
must
be
constantly
added
to
the
fire
the
town
had
not
as
yet
a
renascent
industry
which
could
maintain
this
commercial
process
an
industry
which
should
make
great
transactions
a
warehouse
and
a
market
necessary
it
is
not
enough
that
a
country
should
lose
none
of
the
money
that
forms
its
capital
you
will
not
increase
its
prosperity
by
more
or
less
ingenious
devices
for
causing
this
amount
to
circulate
by
means
of
production
and
consumption
through
the
greatest
possible
number
of
hands
that
is
not
where
your
problem
lies
when
a
country
is
fully
developed
and
its
production
keeps
pace
with
its
consumption
if
private
wealth
is
to
increase
as
well
as
the
wealth
of
the
community
at
large
there
must
be
exchanges
with
other
communities
which
will
keep
a
balance
on
the
right
side
of
the
this
thought
has
let
states
with
a
limited
territorial
basis
like
tyre
carthage
venice
holland
and
england
for
instance
to
secure
the
carrying
trade
i
cast
about
for
some
such
notion
as
this
to
apply
to
our
little
world
so
as
to
inaugurate
a
third
commercial
epoch
our
town
is
so
much
like
any
other
that
our
prosperity
was
scarcely
visible
to
a
passing
stranger
it
was
only
for
me
that
it
was
astonishing
the
folk
had
come
together
by
degrees
they
themselves
were
a
part
of
the
change
and
could
not
judge
of
its
effects
as
a
whole
seven
years
had
gone
by
when
i
met
with
two
strangers
the
real
benefactors
of
the
place
which
perhaps
some
day
they
will
transform
into
a
large
town
one
of
them
is
a
tyrolese
an
exceedingly
clever
fellow
who
makes
rough
shoes
for
country
people
s
wear
and
boots
for
people
of
fashion
in
grenoble
as
no
one
can
make
them
not
even
in
paris
itself
he
was
a
poor
strolling
musician
who
singing
and
working
had
made
his
way
through
italy
one
of
those
busy
germans
who
fashion
the
tools
of
their
own
work
and
make
the
instrument
that
they
play
upon
when
he
came
to
the
town
he
asked
if
any
one
wanted
a
pair
of
shoes
they
sent
him
to
me
and
i
gave
him
an
order
for
two
pairs
of
boots
for
which
he
made
his
own
lasts
the
foreigner
s
skill
surprised
me
he
gave
accurate
and
consistent
answers
to
the
questions
i
put
and
his
face
and
manner
confirmed
the
good
opinion
i
had
formed
of
him
i
suggested
that
he
should
settle
in
the
place
undertaking
to
assist
him
in
business
in
every
way
that
i
could
in
fact
i
put
a
fairly
large
sum
of
money
at
his
disposal
he
accepted
my
offer
i
had
my
own
ideas
in
this
the
quality
of
our
leather
had
improved
and
why
should
we
not
use
it
ourselves
and
before
very
long
make
our
own
shoes
at
moderate
prices
it
was
the
s
business
over
again
on
a
larger
scale
chance
had
put
an
exceedingly
clever
man
in
my
way
and
he
must
be
retained
so
that
a
steady
and
profitable
trade
might
be
given
to
the
place
there
is
a
constant
demand
for
and
a
very
slight
difference
in
price
is
felt
at
once
by
the
purchaser
this
was
my
reasoning
sir
and
fortunately
events
have
justified
it
at
this
time
we
have
five
tanyards
each
of
which
has
its
they
take
all
the
hides
produced
in
the
department
itself
and
even
draw
part
of
their
supply
from
provence
and
yet
the
tyrolese
uses
more
leather
than
they
can
produce
and
has
forty
in
his
employ
i
happened
on
the
other
man
after
a
fashion
no
whit
less
strange
but
you
might
find
the
story
tedious
he
is
just
an
ordinary
peasant
who
discovered
a
cheaper
way
of
making
the
great
hats
that
are
worn
in
this
part
of
the
world
he
sells
them
in
other
cantons
and
even
sends
them
into
switzerland
and
savoy
so
long
as
the
quality
and
the
low
prices
can
be
maintained
here
are
two
inexhaustible
sources
of
wealth
for
the
canton
which
suggested
to
my
mind
the
idea
of
establishing
three
fairs
in
the
year
the
prefect
amazed
at
our
industrial
progress
lent
his
aid
in
obtaining
the
royal
ordinance
which
authorized
them
and
last
year
we
held
our
three
fairs
they
are
known
as
far
as
savoy
as
the
shoe
fair
and
the
hat
fair
the
head
clerk
of
a
notary
in
grenoble
heard
of
these
changes
he
was
poor
but
he
was
a
hardworking
young
fellow
and
mlle
gravier
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
him
he
went
to
paris
to
ask
for
an
authorization
to
establish
himself
here
as
a
notary
and
his
request
was
granted
as
he
had
not
to
pay
for
his
appointment
he
could
afford
to
build
a
house
in
the
market
square
of
the
new
town
opposite
the
house
of
the
justice
of
the
peace
we
have
a
market
once
a
week
and
a
considerable
amount
of
business
is
transacted
in
corn
and
cattle
next
year
a
druggist
surely
ought
to
come
among
us
and
next
we
want
a
clockmaker
a
furniture
dealer
and
a
bookseller
and
so
by
degrees
we
shall
have
all
the
desirable
luxuries
of
life
who
knows
but
that
at
last
we
shall
have
a
number
of
substantial
houses
and
give
ourselves
all
the
airs
of
a
small
city
education
has
made
such
strides
that
there
has
never
been
any
opposition
made
at
the
when
i
proposed
that
we
should
restore
our
church
and
build
a
parsonage
nor
when
i
brought
forward
a
plan
for
laying
out
a
fine
open
space
planted
with
trees
where
the
fairs
could
be
held
and
a
further
scheme
for
a
survey
of
the
township
so
that
its
future
streets
should
be
wholesome
spacious
and
wisely
planned
this
is
how
we
came
to
have
nineteen
hundred
hearths
in
the
place
of
a
hundred
and
three
thousand
head
of
cattle
instead
of
eight
hundred
and
for
a
population
of
seven
hundred
no
less
than
two
thousand
persons
are
living
in
the
township
or
three
thousand
if
the
people
down
the
valley
are
included
there
are
twelve
houses
belonging
to
wealthy
people
in
the
commune
there
are
a
hundred
families
and
two
hundred
more
which
are
thriving
the
rest
have
their
own
exertions
to
look
to
every
one
knows
how
to
read
and
write
and
we
subscribe
to
seventeen
different
newspapers
we
have
poor
people
still
among
us
there
are
far
too
many
of
them
in
fact
but
we
have
no
beggars
and
there
is
work
enough
for
all
i
have
so
many
patients
that
my
daily
round
taxes
the
powers
of
two
horses
i
can
go
anywhere
for
five
miles
round
at
any
hour
without
fear
for
if
any
one
was
minded
to
fire
a
shot
at
me
his
life
would
not
be
worth
ten
minutes
purchase
the
undemonstrative
affection
of
the
people
is
my
sole
gain
from
all
these
changes
except
the
radiant
benassis
that
every
one
gives
me
as
i
pass
you
will
understand
of
course
that
the
wealth
incidentally
acquired
through
my
model
farms
has
only
been
a
means
and
not
an
if
every
one
followed
your
example
in
other
places
sir
france
would
be
great
indeed
and
might
laugh
at
the
rest
of
europe
cried
genestas
enthusiastically
but
i
have
kept
you
out
here
for
half
an
hour
said
benassis
it
is
growing
dark
let
us
go
in
to
the
doctor
s
house
on
the
side
facing
the
garden
consists
of
a
ground
floor
and
a
single
story
with
a
row
of
five
windows
in
each
dormer
windows
also
project
from
the
tiled
the
shutters
are
in
startling
contrast
with
the
gray
tones
of
the
walls
a
vine
wanders
along
the
whole
side
of
the
house
a
pleasant
strip
of
green
like
a
frieze
between
the
two
stories
a
few
struggling
bengal
roses
make
shift
to
live
as
best
they
may
half
drowned
at
times
by
the
drippings
from
the
gutterless
eaves
as
you
enter
the
large
vestibule
the
salon
lies
to
your
right
it
contains
four
windows
two
of
which
look
into
the
yard
and
two
into
the
garden
ceiling
and
wainscot
are
paneled
and
the
walls
are
hung
with
seventeenth
century
tapestry
pathetic
evidence
that
the
room
had
been
the
object
of
the
late
owner
s
aspiration
and
that
he
had
lavished
all
that
he
could
spare
upon
it
the
great
roomy
armchairs
covered
with
brocaded
damask
the
old
fashioned
gilded
above
the
and
the
window
curtains
with
their
heavy
tassels
showed
that
the
cure
had
been
a
wealthy
man
benassis
had
made
some
additions
to
this
furniture
which
was
not
without
a
character
of
its
own
he
had
placed
two
smaller
tables
decorated
with
carved
wooden
garlands
between
the
windows
on
opposite
sides
of
the
room
and
had
put
a
clock
in
a
case
of
tortoise
shell
inlaid
with
copper
upon
the
the
doctor
seldom
occupied
the
salon
its
atmosphere
was
damp
and
close
like
that
of
a
room
that
is
always
kept
shut
memories
of
the
dead
cure
still
lingered
about
it
the
peculiar
scent
of
his
tobacco
seemed
to
pervade
the
corner
by
the
hearth
where
he
had
been
wont
to
sit
the
two
great
were
symmetrically
arranged
on
either
side
of
the
fire
which
had
not
been
lighted
since
the
time
of
gravier
s
visit
the
bright
flames
from
the
pine
logs
lighted
the
room
the
evenings
are
chilly
even
now
said
benassis
it
is
pleasant
to
see
a
genestas
was
meditating
he
was
beginning
to
understand
the
doctor
s
indifference
to
his
surroundings
it
is
surprising
to
me
sir
that
you
who
possess
real
public
spirit
should
have
made
no
effort
to
enlighten
the
government
after
accomplishing
so
benassis
began
to
laugh
but
without
bitterness
he
said
rather
sadly
you
mean
that
i
should
draw
up
some
sort
of
memorial
on
various
ways
of
civilizing
france
you
are
not
the
first
to
suggest
it
sir
gravier
has
forestalled
you
unluckily
governments
can
not
be
enlightened
and
a
government
which
regards
itself
as
a
diffuser
of
light
is
the
least
open
to
enlightenment
what
we
have
done
for
our
canton
every
mayor
ought
of
course
to
do
for
his
the
magistrate
should
work
for
his
town
the
for
his
district
the
prefect
for
the
department
and
the
minister
for
france
each
acting
in
his
own
sphere
of
interest
for
the
few
miles
of
country
road
that
i
persuaded
our
people
to
make
another
would
succeed
in
constructing
a
canal
or
a
highway
and
for
my
encouragement
of
the
peasants
trade
in
hats
a
minister
would
emancipate
france
from
the
industrial
yoke
of
the
foreigner
by
encouraging
the
manufacture
of
clocks
in
different
places
by
helping
to
bring
to
perfection
our
iron
and
steel
our
tools
and
appliances
or
by
bringing
silk
or
dyer
s
woad
into
cultivation
in
commerce
encouragement
does
not
mean
protection
a
really
wise
policy
should
aim
at
making
a
country
independent
of
foreign
supply
but
this
should
be
effected
without
resorting
to
the
pitiful
shifts
of
customs
duties
and
prohibitions
industries
must
work
out
their
own
salvation
competition
is
the
life
of
trade
a
protected
industry
goes
to
sleep
and
monopoly
like
the
protective
tariff
kills
it
outright
the
country
upon
which
all
others
depend
for
their
supplies
will
be
the
land
which
will
promulgate
free
trade
for
it
will
be
conscious
of
its
power
to
produce
its
manufactures
at
prices
lower
than
those
of
any
of
its
competitors
france
is
in
a
better
position
to
attain
this
end
than
england
for
france
alone
possesses
an
amount
of
territory
sufficiently
extensive
to
maintain
a
supply
of
agricultural
produce
at
prices
that
will
enable
the
worker
to
live
on
low
wages
the
administration
should
keep
this
end
in
view
for
therein
lies
the
whole
modern
question
i
have
not
devoted
my
life
to
this
study
dear
sir
i
found
my
work
by
accident
and
late
in
the
day
such
simple
things
as
these
are
too
slight
moreover
to
build
into
a
system
there
is
nothing
wonderful
about
them
they
do
not
lend
themselves
to
theories
it
is
their
misfortune
to
be
merely
practically
useful
and
then
work
can
not
be
done
quickly
the
man
who
means
to
succeed
in
these
ways
must
daily
look
to
find
within
himself
the
stock
of
courage
needed
for
the
day
a
courage
in
reality
of
the
rarest
kind
though
it
does
not
seem
hard
to
practise
and
meets
with
little
recognition
the
courage
of
the
schoolmaster
who
must
say
the
same
things
over
and
over
again
we
all
honor
the
man
who
has
shed
his
blood
on
the
battlefield
as
you
have
done
but
we
ridicule
this
other
whose
is
slowly
consumed
in
repeating
the
same
words
to
children
of
the
same
age
there
is
no
attraction
for
any
of
us
in
obscure
we
know
nothing
of
the
civic
virtue
that
led
the
great
men
of
ancient
times
to
serve
their
country
in
the
lowest
rank
whenever
they
did
not
command
our
age
is
afflicted
with
a
disease
that
makes
each
of
us
seek
to
rise
above
his
fellows
and
there
are
more
saints
than
shrines
among
us
this
is
how
it
has
come
to
pass
the
monarchy
fell
and
we
lost
honor
christian
virtue
faded
with
the
religion
of
our
forefathers
and
our
own
ineffectual
attempts
at
government
have
destroyed
patriotism
ideas
can
never
utterly
perish
so
these
beliefs
linger
on
in
our
midst
but
they
do
not
influence
the
great
mass
of
the
people
and
society
has
no
support
but
egoism
every
individual
believes
in
himself
for
us
the
future
means
egoism
further
than
that
we
can
not
see
the
great
man
who
shall
save
us
from
the
shipwreck
which
is
imminent
will
no
doubt
avail
himself
of
individualism
when
he
makes
a
nation
of
us
once
more
but
until
this
regeneration
comes
we
bide
our
time
in
a
materialistic
and
utilitarian
age
utilitarianism
to
this
conclusion
we
have
come
we
are
all
rated
not
at
our
just
worth
but
according
to
our
social
importance
people
will
scarcely
look
at
an
energetic
man
if
he
is
in
the
government
itself
is
pervaded
by
this
idea
a
minister
sends
a
paltry
medal
to
a
sailor
who
has
saved
a
dozen
lives
at
the
risk
of
his
own
while
the
deputy
who
sells
his
vote
to
those
in
power
receives
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
woe
to
a
people
made
up
of
such
men
as
these
for
nations
like
men
owe
all
the
strength
and
vitality
that
is
in
them
to
noble
thoughts
and
aspirations
and
men
s
feelings
shape
their
faith
but
when
has
taken
the
place
of
faith
and
each
one
of
us
thinks
only
of
himself
and
believes
in
himself
alone
how
can
you
expect
to
find
among
us
much
of
that
civil
courage
whose
very
essence
consists
in
the
same
principle
underlies
both
military
and
civil
courage
although
you
soldiers
are
called
upon
to
yield
your
lives
up
once
and
for
all
while
ours
are
given
slowly
drop
by
drop
and
the
battle
is
the
same
for
both
although
it
takes
different
forms
the
man
who
would
fain
civilize
the
lowliest
spot
on
earth
needs
something
besides
wealth
for
the
task
knowledge
is
still
more
necessary
and
knowledge
and
patriotism
and
integrity
are
worthless
unless
they
are
accompanied
by
a
firm
determination
on
his
part
to
set
his
own
personal
interests
completely
aside
and
to
devote
himself
to
a
social
idea
france
no
doubt
possesses
more
than
one
man
and
more
than
one
patriot
in
every
commune
but
i
am
fully
persuaded
that
not
every
canton
can
produce
a
man
who
to
these
valuable
qualifications
unites
the
unflagging
will
and
pertinacity
with
which
a
blacksmith
hammers
out
iron
the
destroyer
and
the
builder
are
two
manifestations
of
will
the
one
prepares
the
way
and
the
other
accomplishes
the
work
the
first
appears
in
the
guise
of
a
spirit
of
evil
and
the
second
seems
like
the
spirit
of
good
glory
falls
to
the
destroyer
while
the
builder
is
forgotten
for
evil
makes
a
noise
in
the
world
that
rouses
little
souls
to
admiration
while
good
deeds
are
slow
to
make
themselves
heard
leads
us
to
prefer
the
more
conspicuous
part
if
it
should
happen
that
any
public
work
is
undertaken
without
an
interested
motive
it
will
only
be
by
accident
until
the
day
when
education
has
changed
our
ways
of
regarding
things
in
france
yet
suppose
that
this
change
had
come
to
pass
and
that
all
of
us
were
citizens
in
spite
of
our
comfortable
lives
among
trivialities
should
we
not
be
in
a
fair
way
to
become
the
most
wearied
wearisome
and
unfortunate
race
of
philistines
under
the
sun
i
am
not
at
the
helm
of
state
the
decision
of
great
questions
of
this
kind
is
not
within
my
province
but
setting
these
considerations
aside
there
are
other
difficulties
in
the
way
of
laying
down
hard
and
fast
rules
as
to
government
in
the
matter
of
civilization
everything
is
relative
ideas
that
suit
one
country
admirably
are
fatal
in
another
men
s
minds
are
as
various
as
the
soils
of
the
globe
if
we
have
so
often
been
ill
governed
it
is
because
a
faculty
for
government
like
taste
is
the
outcome
of
a
very
rare
and
lofty
attitude
of
mind
the
qualifications
for
the
work
are
found
in
a
natural
bent
of
the
soul
rather
than
in
the
possession
of
scientific
formulae
no
one
need
fear
however
to
call
himself
a
statesman
for
his
actions
and
motives
can
not
be
justly
estimated
his
real
judges
are
far
away
and
the
results
of
his
deeds
are
even
more
remote
we
have
a
great
respect
here
in
france
for
men
of
ideas
a
keen
intellect
exerts
a
great
attraction
for
us
but
ideas
are
of
little
value
where
a
resolute
will
is
the
one
thing
needful
administration
as
a
matter
of
fact
does
not
consist
in
forcing
more
or
less
wise
methods
and
ideas
upon
the
great
mass
of
the
nation
but
in
giving
to
the
ideas
good
or
bad
that
they
already
possess
a
practical
turn
which
will
make
them
conduce
to
the
general
welfare
of
the
state
if
prejudices
and
customs
bring
a
country
into
a
bad
way
the
people
will
renounce
their
errors
of
their
own
accord
are
not
losses
the
result
of
economical
errors
of
every
kind
and
is
it
not
therefore
to
every
one
s
interest
to
rectify
them
in
the
long
run
luckily
i
found
a
in
this
district
they
have
followed
my
advice
and
the
land
is
well
cultivated
but
there
had
been
no
previous
errors
in
agriculture
and
the
soil
was
good
to
begin
with
so
that
it
has
been
easy
to
introduce
the
shift
artificial
grasses
and
potatoes
my
methods
did
not
clash
with
people
s
prejudices
the
faultily
constructed
plowshares
in
use
in
some
parts
of
france
were
unknown
here
the
hoe
sufficed
for
the
little
field
work
that
they
did
our
wheelwright
extolled
my
wheeled
plows
because
he
wished
to
increase
his
own
business
so
i
secured
an
ally
in
him
but
in
this
matter
as
in
all
others
i
sought
to
make
the
good
of
one
conduce
to
the
good
of
all
then
i
turned
my
attention
to
another
kind
of
production
that
should
increase
the
welfare
rather
than
the
wealth
of
these
poor
folk
i
have
brought
nothing
from
without
into
this
district
i
have
simply
encouraged
the
people
to
seek
beyond
its
limits
for
a
market
for
their
produce
a
measure
that
could
not
but
increase
their
prosperity
in
a
way
that
they
felt
immediately
they
had
no
idea
of
the
fact
but
they
themselves
were
my
apostles
and
their
works
preached
my
doctrines
something
else
must
also
be
borne
in
mind
we
are
barely
five
leagues
from
grenoble
there
is
plenty
of
demand
in
a
large
city
for
produce
of
all
kinds
but
not
every
commune
is
situated
at
the
gates
of
a
city
in
every
similar
undertaking
the
nature
situation
and
resources
of
the
country
must
be
taken
into
consideration
and
a
careful
study
must
be
made
of
the
soil
of
the
people
themselves
and
of
many
other
things
and
no
one
should
expect
to
have
vines
grow
in
normandy
so
no
tasks
can
be
more
various
than
those
of
government
and
its
general
principles
must
be
few
in
number
the
law
is
uniform
but
not
so
the
land
and
the
minds
and
customs
of
those
who
dwell
in
it
and
the
administration
of
the
law
is
the
art
of
carrying
it
out
in
such
a
manner
that
no
injury
is
done
to
people
s
interests
every
place
must
be
considered
separately
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
at
the
foot
of
which
our
deserted
village
lies
they
find
it
impossible
to
use
wheeled
plows
because
the
soil
is
not
deep
enough
now
if
the
mayor
of
the
commune
were
to
take
it
into
his
head
to
follow
in
our
footsteps
he
would
be
the
ruin
of
his
neighborhood
i
advised
him
to
plant
vineyards
they
had
a
capital
vintage
last
year
in
the
little
district
and
their
wine
is
exchanged
for
our
corn
then
lastly
it
must
be
remembered
that
my
words
carried
a
certain
weight
with
the
people
to
whom
i
preached
and
that
we
were
continually
brought
into
close
contact
i
cured
my
peasants
complaints
an
easy
task
for
a
nourishing
diet
is
as
a
rule
all
that
is
needed
to
restore
them
to
health
and
strength
either
through
thrift
or
through
sheer
poverty
the
country
people
starve
themselves
any
illness
among
them
is
caused
in
this
way
and
as
a
rule
they
enjoy
very
fair
health
when
i
first
decided
to
devote
myself
to
this
life
of
obscure
renunciation
i
was
in
doubt
for
a
long
while
whether
to
become
a
cure
a
country
doctor
or
a
justice
of
the
peace
it
is
not
without
reason
that
people
speak
collectively
of
the
priest
the
lawyer
and
the
doctor
as
men
of
the
black
robe
so
the
saying
goes
they
represent
the
three
principal
elements
necessary
to
the
existence
of
society
conscience
property
and
health
at
one
time
the
first
and
at
a
later
period
the
second
was
in
the
state
our
predecessors
on
this
earth
thought
perhaps
not
without
reason
that
the
priest
who
prescribed
what
men
should
think
ought
to
be
paramount
so
the
priest
was
king
pontiff
and
judge
in
one
for
in
those
days
belief
and
faith
were
everything
all
this
has
been
changed
in
our
day
and
we
must
even
take
our
epoch
as
we
find
it
but
i
for
one
believe
that
the
progress
of
civilization
and
the
welfare
of
the
people
depend
on
these
three
men
they
are
the
three
powers
who
bring
home
to
the
people
s
minds
the
ways
in
which
facts
interests
and
principles
affect
them
they
themselves
are
three
great
results
produced
in
the
midst
of
the
nation
by
the
operation
of
events
by
the
ownership
of
property
and
by
the
growth
of
ideas
time
goes
on
and
brings
changes
to
pass
property
increases
or
diminishes
in
men
s
hands
all
the
various
readjustments
have
to
be
duly
regulated
and
in
this
way
principles
of
social
order
are
established
if
civilization
is
to
spread
itself
and
production
is
to
be
increased
the
people
must
be
made
to
understand
the
way
in
which
the
interests
of
the
individual
harmonize
with
national
interests
which
resolve
themselves
into
facts
interests
and
principles
as
these
three
professions
are
bound
to
deal
with
these
issues
of
human
life
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
must
be
the
most
powerful
civilizing
agencies
of
our
time
they
alone
afford
to
a
man
of
wealth
the
opportunity
of
mitigating
the
fate
of
the
poor
with
whom
they
daily
bring
him
in
contact
the
peasant
is
always
more
willing
to
listen
to
the
man
who
lays
down
rules
for
saving
him
from
bodily
ills
than
to
the
priest
who
exhorts
him
to
save
his
soul
the
first
speaker
can
talk
of
this
earth
the
scene
of
the
peasant
s
labors
while
the
priest
is
bound
to
talk
to
him
of
heaven
with
which
unfortunately
the
peasant
nowadays
concerns
himself
very
little
indeed
i
say
unfortunately
because
the
doctrine
of
a
future
life
is
not
only
a
consolation
but
a
means
by
which
men
may
be
governed
is
not
religion
the
one
power
that
sanctions
social
laws
we
have
but
lately
vindicated
the
existence
of
god
in
the
absence
of
a
religion
the
government
was
driven
to
invent
the
terror
in
order
to
carry
its
laws
into
effect
but
the
terror
was
the
fear
of
man
and
it
has
passed
away
when
a
peasant
is
ill
when
he
is
forced
to
lie
on
his
pallet
and
while
he
is
recovering
he
can
not
help
himself
he
is
forced
to
listen
to
logical
reasoning
which
he
can
understand
quite
well
if
it
is
put
clearly
before
him
this
thought
made
a
doctor
of
me
my
calculations
for
the
peasants
were
made
along
with
them
i
never
gave
advice
unless
i
was
quite
sure
of
the
results
and
in
this
way
compelled
them
to
admit
the
wisdom
of
my
views
the
people
require
infallibility
infallibility
was
the
making
of
napoleon
he
would
have
been
a
god
if
he
had
not
filled
the
world
with
the
sound
of
his
fall
at
waterloo
if
mahomet
founded
a
permanent
religion
after
conquering
the
third
part
of
the
globe
it
was
by
dint
of
concealing
his
deathbed
from
the
crowd
the
same
rules
hold
good
for
the
great
conqueror
and
for
the
provincial
mayor
and
a
nation
or
a
commune
is
much
the
same
sort
of
crowd
indeed
the
great
multitude
of
mankind
is
the
same
everywhere
i
have
been
exceedingly
firm
with
those
whom
i
have
helped
with
money
if
i
had
not
been
inflexible
on
this
point
they
all
would
have
laughed
at
me
peasants
no
less
than
worldlings
end
by
despising
the
man
that
they
can
deceive
he
has
been
cheated
clearly
then
he
must
have
been
weak
and
it
is
might
alone
that
governs
the
world
i
have
never
charged
a
penny
for
my
professional
advice
except
to
those
who
were
evidently
rich
people
but
i
have
not
allowed
the
value
of
my
services
to
be
overlooked
at
all
and
i
always
make
them
pay
for
medicine
unless
the
patient
is
exceedingly
poor
if
my
peasants
do
not
pay
me
in
money
they
are
quite
aware
that
they
are
in
my
debt
sometimes
they
satisfy
their
consciences
by
bringing
oats
for
my
horses
or
corn
when
it
is
cheap
but
if
the
miller
were
to
send
me
some
eels
as
a
return
for
my
advice
i
should
tell
him
that
he
is
too
generous
for
such
a
small
matter
my
politeness
bears
fruit
in
the
winter
i
shall
have
some
sacks
of
flour
for
the
poor
ah
sir
they
have
kind
hearts
these
people
if
one
does
not
slight
them
and
i
think
more
good
and
less
evil
of
them
than
i
did
what
a
deal
of
trouble
you
have
taken
said
genestas
not
at
all
answered
benassis
it
was
no
more
trouble
to
say
something
useful
than
to
chatter
about
trifles
and
whether
i
chatted
or
joked
the
talk
always
turned
on
them
and
their
concerns
wherever
i
went
they
would
not
listen
to
me
at
first
i
had
to
overcome
their
dislikes
i
belonged
to
the
middle
classes
that
is
to
say
i
was
a
natural
enemy
i
found
the
struggle
amusing
an
easy
or
an
uneasy
conscience
that
is
all
the
difference
that
lies
between
doing
well
or
ill
the
trouble
is
the
same
in
either
case
if
scoundrels
would
but
behave
themselves
properly
they
might
be
millionaires
instead
of
being
hanged
that
is
the
dinner
is
growing
cold
sir
cried
jacquotte
in
the
doorway
genestas
caught
the
doctor
s
arm
i
have
only
one
comment
to
offer
on
what
i
have
just
heard
he
remarked
i
am
not
acquainted
with
any
account
of
the
wars
of
mahomet
so
that
i
can
form
no
opinions
as
to
his
military
talents
but
if
you
had
only
watched
the
emperor
s
tactics
during
the
campaign
in
france
you
might
well
have
taken
him
for
a
god
and
if
he
was
beaten
on
the
field
of
waterloo
it
was
because
he
was
more
than
mortal
it
was
because
the
earth
found
his
weight
too
heavy
to
bear
and
sprang
from
under
his
feet
on
every
other
subject
i
entirely
agree
with
you
and
de
whoever
hatched
you
did
a
good
day
s
come
exclaimed
benassis
with
a
smile
let
us
sit
down
to
the
walls
of
the
were
paneled
from
floor
to
ceiling
and
painted
gray
the
furniture
consisted
of
a
few
chairs
a
sideboard
some
cupboards
a
stove
and
the
late
owner
s
celebrated
clock
there
were
white
curtains
in
the
window
and
a
white
cloth
on
the
table
about
which
there
was
no
sign
of
luxury
the
dinner
service
was
of
plain
white
earthenware
the
soup
made
after
the
traditions
of
the
late
cure
was
the
most
concentrated
kind
of
broth
that
was
ever
set
to
simmer
by
any
mortal
cook
the
doctor
and
his
guest
had
scarcely
finished
it
when
a
man
rushed
into
the
kitchen
and
in
spite
of
jacquotte
suddenly
invaded
the
well
what
is
it
asked
the
doctor
it
is
this
sir
the
mistress
our
mme
vigneau
has
turned
as
white
as
white
can
be
so
that
we
are
frightened
about
oh
well
then
benassis
said
cheerfully
i
must
leave
the
table
and
he
rose
to
go
in
spite
of
the
doctor
s
entreaties
genestas
flung
down
his
and
swore
in
a
soldierly
fashion
that
he
would
not
finish
his
dinner
without
his
host
he
returned
indeed
to
the
salon
and
as
he
warmed
himself
by
the
fire
he
thought
over
the
troubles
that
no
man
may
escape
the
troubles
that
are
found
in
every
lot
that
it
falls
to
man
to
endure
here
upon
earth
benassis
soon
came
back
and
the
two
future
friends
sat
down
again
taboureau
has
just
come
up
to
speak
to
you
said
jacquotte
to
her
master
as
she
brought
in
the
dishes
that
she
had
kept
hot
for
them
who
can
be
ill
at
his
place
asked
the
doctor
no
one
is
ill
sir
i
think
from
what
he
said
that
it
is
some
matter
of
his
own
that
he
wants
to
ask
you
about
he
is
coming
back
very
good
this
taboureau
benassis
went
on
addressing
genestas
is
for
me
a
whole
philosophical
treatise
take
a
good
look
at
him
when
he
comes
he
is
sure
to
amuse
you
he
was
a
laborer
a
thrifty
man
eating
little
and
getting
through
a
good
deal
of
work
as
soon
as
the
rogue
came
to
have
a
few
crowns
of
his
own
his
intelligence
began
to
develop
he
watched
the
progress
which
i
had
originated
in
this
little
district
with
an
eye
to
his
own
profit
he
had
made
quite
a
fortune
in
eight
year
s
time
that
is
to
say
a
fortune
for
our
part
of
the
world
very
likely
he
may
have
a
couple
of
score
thousand
francs
by
now
but
if
i
were
to
give
you
a
thousand
guesses
you
would
never
find
out
how
he
made
the
money
he
is
a
usurer
and
his
scheme
of
usury
is
so
profoundly
and
so
cleverly
based
upon
the
requirements
of
the
whole
canton
that
i
should
merely
waste
my
time
if
i
were
to
take
it
upon
myself
to
undeceive
them
as
to
the
benefits
which
they
reap
in
their
own
opinion
from
their
dealings
with
taboureau
when
this
devil
of
a
fellow
saw
every
one
cultivating
his
own
plot
of
ground
he
hurried
about
buying
grain
so
as
to
supply
the
poor
with
the
requisite
seed
here
as
everywhere
else
the
peasants
and
even
some
of
the
farmers
had
no
ready
money
with
which
to
pay
for
seed
to
some
master
taboureau
would
lend
a
sack
of
barley
for
which
he
was
to
receive
a
sack
of
rye
at
harvest
time
and
to
others
a
measure
of
wheat
for
a
sack
of
four
at
the
present
day
the
man
has
extended
this
curious
business
of
his
all
over
the
department
and
unless
something
happens
to
prevent
him
he
will
go
on
and
very
likely
make
a
million
well
my
dear
sir
taboureau
the
laborer
an
obliging
fellow
used
to
lend
a
helping
hand
to
any
one
who
asked
him
but
as
his
gains
have
increased
taboureau
has
become
litigious
arrogant
and
somewhat
given
to
sharp
practice
the
more
money
he
makes
the
worse
he
grows
the
moment
that
the
peasant
forsakes
his
life
of
toil
pure
and
simple
for
the
leisured
existence
of
the
landowning
classes
he
becomes
intolerable
there
is
a
certain
kind
of
character
partly
virtuous
partly
vicious
which
will
always
be
the
despair
of
governments
you
will
see
an
example
of
it
in
taboureau
he
looks
simple
and
even
doltish
but
when
his
interests
are
in
question
he
is
certainly
profoundly
a
heavy
footstep
announced
the
approach
of
the
grain
lender
come
in
taboureau
cried
benassis
thus
forewarned
by
the
doctor
the
commandant
scrutinized
the
peasant
in
the
doorway
taboureau
was
decidedly
thin
and
stooped
a
little
he
had
a
bulging
forehead
covered
with
wrinkles
and
a
cavernous
face
in
which
two
small
gray
eyes
with
a
dark
spot
in
either
of
them
seemed
to
be
pierced
rather
than
set
the
lines
of
the
miser
s
mouth
were
close
and
firm
and
his
narrow
chin
turned
up
to
meet
an
exaggeratedly
hooked
nose
his
hair
was
turning
gray
already
and
deep
furrows
which
converged
above
the
prominent
spoke
of
the
wily
shrewdness
of
a
and
of
a
life
spent
in
journeying
about
he
wore
a
blue
coat
in
fairly
clean
condition
the
square
flaps
stuck
out
above
his
hips
and
the
skirts
of
the
coats
hung
loose
in
front
so
that
a
waistcoat
was
visible
there
he
stood
firmly
planted
on
both
feet
leaning
upon
a
thick
stick
with
a
knob
at
the
end
of
it
a
little
spaniel
had
followed
the
in
spite
of
jacquotte
s
efforts
and
was
crouching
beside
him
well
what
is
it
benassis
asked
as
he
turned
to
this
being
taboureau
gave
a
suspicious
glance
at
the
stranger
seated
at
the
doctor
s
table
and
said
it
is
not
a
case
of
illness
le
but
you
understand
how
to
doctor
the
ailments
of
the
purse
just
as
well
as
those
of
the
body
we
have
had
a
little
difficulty
with
a
man
over
at
and
i
have
come
to
ask
your
advice
about
why
not
see
the
justice
of
the
peace
or
his
clerk
oh
because
you
are
so
much
cleverer
sir
and
i
shall
feel
more
sure
about
my
case
if
i
can
have
your
my
good
taboureau
i
am
willing
to
give
medical
advice
to
the
poor
without
charging
for
it
but
i
can
not
look
into
the
lawsuits
of
a
man
who
is
as
wealthy
as
you
are
for
nothing
it
costs
a
good
deal
to
acquire
that
kind
of
taboureau
began
to
twist
his
hat
about
if
you
want
my
advice
in
order
to
save
the
hard
coin
you
would
have
to
pay
to
the
lawyer
folk
over
in
grenoble
you
must
send
a
bag
of
rye
to
the
widow
martin
the
woman
who
is
bringing
up
the
charity
i
will
do
it
with
all
my
heart
sir
if
you
think
it
necessary
can
i
talk
about
this
business
of
mine
without
troubling
the
gentleman
there
he
added
with
a
look
at
genestas
the
doctor
nodded
so
taboureau
went
on
well
then
sir
two
months
ago
a
man
from
came
over
here
to
find
me
taboureau
said
he
to
me
could
you
sell
me
a
hundred
and
measures
of
barley
why
not
say
i
that
is
my
trade
do
you
want
it
immediately
no
he
says
i
want
it
for
the
beginning
of
spring
in
so
far
so
good
well
we
drive
our
bargain
and
we
drink
a
glass
and
we
agree
that
he
is
to
pay
me
the
price
that
the
barley
fetched
at
grenoble
last
market
day
and
i
am
to
deliver
it
in
march
i
am
to
warehouse
it
at
owner
s
risk
and
no
allowance
for
shrinkage
of
course
but
barley
goes
up
and
up
my
dear
sir
the
barley
rises
like
boiling
milk
then
i
am
hard
up
for
money
and
i
sell
my
barley
quite
natural
sir
was
it
not
no
said
benassis
the
barley
had
passed
out
of
your
possession
you
were
only
warehousing
it
and
suppose
the
barley
had
gone
down
in
value
would
you
not
have
compelled
your
buyer
to
take
it
at
the
price
you
agreed
upon
but
very
likely
he
would
not
have
paid
me
sir
one
must
look
out
for
oneself
the
seller
ought
to
make
a
good
profit
when
the
chance
comes
in
his
way
and
after
all
the
goods
are
not
yours
until
you
have
paid
for
them
that
is
so
l
is
it
not
for
you
can
see
that
the
gentleman
has
been
in
the
taboureau
benassis
said
sternly
ill
luck
will
come
to
you
sooner
or
later
god
punishes
ill
deeds
how
can
you
knowing
as
much
as
you
do
a
capable
man
moreover
and
a
man
who
conducts
his
business
honorably
set
examples
of
dishonesty
to
the
canton
if
you
allow
such
proceedings
as
this
to
be
taken
against
you
how
can
you
expect
that
the
poor
will
remain
honest
people
and
will
not
rob
you
your
laborers
will
cheat
you
out
of
part
of
their
working
hours
and
every
one
here
will
be
demoralized
you
are
in
the
wrong
your
barley
was
as
good
as
delivered
if
the
man
from
had
fetched
it
himself
you
would
not
have
gone
there
to
take
it
away
from
him
you
have
sold
something
that
was
no
longer
yours
to
sell
for
your
barley
had
already
been
turned
into
money
which
was
to
be
paid
down
at
the
stipulated
time
but
go
genestas
gave
the
doctor
a
significant
glance
to
call
his
attention
to
taboureau
s
impassive
countenance
not
a
muscle
had
stirred
in
the
usurer
s
face
during
this
reprimand
there
was
no
flush
on
his
forehead
and
no
sign
of
emotion
in
his
little
eyes
well
sir
i
am
called
upon
to
supply
the
barley
at
last
winter
s
price
now
consider
that
i
am
not
bound
to
do
look
here
taboureau
deliver
that
barley
and
be
very
quick
about
it
or
make
up
your
mind
to
be
respected
by
nobody
in
the
future
even
if
you
gained
the
day
in
a
case
like
this
you
would
be
looked
upon
as
an
unscrupulous
man
who
does
not
keep
to
his
word
and
is
not
bound
by
promises
or
by
honor
or
go
on
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
tell
me
that
i
am
a
scamp
a
scoundrel
a
thief
outright
you
can
say
things
like
that
in
business
without
insulting
anybody
le
maire
tis
each
for
himself
in
business
you
well
then
why
deliberately
put
yourself
in
a
position
in
which
you
deserve
to
be
called
by
such
names
but
if
the
law
is
on
my
side
sir
but
the
law
will
certainly
be
on
your
are
you
quite
sure
about
it
sir
certain
sure
for
you
see
it
is
an
important
certainly
i
am
quite
sure
if
i
were
not
at
dinner
i
would
have
down
the
code
and
you
should
see
for
yourself
if
the
case
comes
on
you
will
lose
it
and
you
will
never
set
foot
in
my
house
again
for
i
do
not
wish
to
receive
people
whom
i
do
not
respect
do
you
understand
you
will
lose
your
oh
no
not
at
all
i
shall
not
lose
it
sir
said
taboureau
you
see
sir
it
is
this
way
it
is
the
man
from
who
owes
the
barley
i
bought
it
of
him
and
now
he
refuses
to
deliver
it
i
just
wanted
to
make
quite
certain
that
i
should
gain
my
case
before
going
to
any
expense
at
court
about
genestas
and
the
doctor
exchanged
glances
each
concealed
his
amazement
at
the
ingenious
device
by
which
the
man
had
sought
to
learn
the
truth
about
this
point
of
law
very
well
taboureau
your
man
is
a
swindler
you
should
not
make
bargains
with
such
ah
sir
they
understand
business
those
people
your
servant
well
now
remarked
benassis
when
the
usurer
had
gone
if
that
fellow
were
in
paris
do
you
not
think
that
he
would
be
a
millionaire
before
very
long
after
dinner
the
doctor
and
his
visitor
went
back
to
the
salon
and
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
until
bedtime
they
talked
about
war
and
politics
genestas
evincing
a
most
violent
dislike
of
the
english
in
the
course
of
conversation
may
i
know
whom
i
have
the
honor
of
entertaining
as
a
guest
asked
the
doctor
my
name
is
pierre
bluteau
answered
genestas
i
am
a
captain
stationed
at
very
well
sir
do
you
care
to
adopt
gravier
s
plan
in
the
morning
after
breakfast
he
liked
to
go
on
my
rounds
with
me
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
you
would
find
anything
to
interest
you
in
the
things
that
occupy
me
they
are
so
very
commonplace
for
after
all
you
own
no
land
about
here
nor
are
you
the
mayor
of
the
place
and
you
will
see
nothing
in
the
canton
that
you
can
not
see
elsewhere
one
thatched
cottage
is
just
like
another
still
you
will
be
in
the
open
air
and
you
will
have
something
to
take
you
out
of
no
proposal
could
give
me
more
pleasure
i
did
not
venture
to
make
it
myself
lest
i
should
thrust
myself
upon
commandant
genestas
who
shall
keep
his
own
name
in
spite
of
the
fictitious
appellation
which
he
had
thought
fit
to
give
himself
followed
his
host
to
a
room
on
the
first
floor
above
the
salon
that
is
right
said
benassis
jacquotte
has
lighted
a
fire
for
you
if
you
want
anything
there
is
a
close
to
the
head
of
the
i
am
not
likely
to
want
anything
however
small
it
seems
to
me
exclaimed
genestas
there
is
even
a
only
an
old
trooper
knows
what
a
is
worth
there
are
times
when
one
is
out
on
a
campaign
sir
when
one
is
ready
to
burn
down
a
house
to
come
by
a
knave
of
a
after
a
few
marches
one
on
the
top
of
another
or
above
all
after
an
engagement
there
are
times
when
a
swollen
foot
and
the
soaked
leather
will
not
part
company
pull
as
you
will
i
have
had
to
lie
down
in
my
boots
more
than
once
one
can
put
up
with
the
annoyance
so
long
as
one
is
by
the
commandant
s
wink
gave
a
kind
of
profound
slyness
to
his
last
utterance
then
he
began
to
make
a
survey
not
without
surprise
he
saw
that
the
room
was
neatly
kept
comfortable
and
almost
luxurious
what
splendor
was
his
comment
your
own
room
must
be
something
come
and
see
said
the
doctor
i
am
your
neighbor
there
is
nothing
but
the
staircase
between
genestas
was
again
surprised
when
he
entered
the
doctor
s
room
a
apartment
with
no
adornment
on
the
walls
save
an
of
a
yellowish
tint
with
a
pattern
of
brown
roses
over
it
the
color
had
gone
in
patches
here
and
there
there
was
a
roughly
painted
iron
bedstead
two
gray
cotton
curtains
were
suspended
from
a
wooden
bracket
above
it
and
a
threadbare
strip
of
carpet
lay
at
the
foot
it
was
like
a
bed
in
a
hospital
by
the
stood
a
rickety
cupboard
on
four
feet
with
a
door
that
continually
rattled
with
a
sound
like
castanets
three
chairs
and
a
couple
of
armchairs
stood
about
the
room
and
on
a
low
chest
of
drawers
in
walnut
wood
stood
a
basin
and
a
ewer
of
obsolete
pattern
with
a
lid
which
was
kept
in
place
by
a
leaden
rim
round
the
top
of
the
vessel
this
completed
the
list
of
the
furniture
the
grate
was
empty
all
the
apparatus
required
for
shaving
lay
about
in
front
of
an
old
mirror
suspended
above
the
painted
stone
by
a
bit
of
string
the
floor
was
clean
and
carefully
swept
but
it
was
worn
and
splintered
in
various
places
and
there
were
hollows
in
it
here
and
there
gray
cotton
curtains
bordered
with
a
green
fringe
adorned
the
two
windows
the
scrupulous
cleanliness
maintained
by
jacquotte
gave
a
certain
air
of
distinction
to
this
picture
of
simplicity
but
everything
in
it
down
to
the
round
table
littered
with
stray
papers
and
the
very
pens
on
the
gave
the
idea
of
an
almost
monastic
life
a
life
so
wholly
filled
with
thought
and
feeling
of
a
wider
kind
that
outward
surroundings
had
come
to
be
matters
of
no
moment
an
open
door
allowed
the
commandant
to
see
the
smaller
room
which
doubtless
the
doctor
seldom
occupied
it
was
scarcely
kept
in
the
same
condition
as
the
adjoining
apartment
a
few
dusty
books
lay
strewn
about
over
the
no
less
dusty
shelves
and
from
the
rows
of
labeled
bottles
it
was
easy
to
guess
that
the
place
was
devoted
rather
to
the
dispensing
of
drugs
than
scientific
studies
why
this
difference
between
your
room
and
mine
you
will
ask
said
benassis
listen
a
moment
i
have
always
blushed
for
those
who
put
their
guests
in
the
attics
who
furnish
them
with
mirrors
that
distort
everything
to
such
a
degree
that
any
one
beholding
himself
might
think
that
he
was
smaller
or
larger
than
nature
made
him
or
suffering
from
apoplectic
stroke
or
some
other
bad
complaint
ought
we
not
to
do
our
utmost
to
make
a
room
as
pleasant
as
possible
during
the
time
that
our
friend
can
be
with
us
hospitality
to
my
thinking
is
a
virtue
a
pleasure
and
a
luxury
but
in
whatever
light
it
is
considered
nay
even
if
you
regard
it
as
a
speculation
ought
not
our
guest
or
our
friend
to
be
made
much
of
ought
not
every
refinement
of
luxury
to
be
reserved
for
him
so
the
best
furniture
is
put
into
your
room
where
a
thick
carpet
is
laid
down
there
are
hangings
on
the
walls
and
a
clock
and
wax
candles
and
for
you
jacquotte
will
do
her
best
she
has
no
doubt
brought
a
and
a
pair
of
new
slippers
and
some
milk
and
her
too
for
your
benefit
i
hope
that
you
will
find
that
luxurious
armchair
the
most
comfortable
seat
you
have
ever
sat
in
it
was
a
discovery
of
the
late
cure
s
i
do
not
know
where
he
found
it
but
it
is
a
fact
that
if
you
wish
to
meet
with
the
perfection
of
comfort
beauty
or
convenience
you
must
ask
counsel
of
the
church
well
i
hope
that
you
will
find
everything
in
your
room
to
your
liking
you
will
find
some
good
razors
and
excellent
soap
and
all
the
trifling
details
that
make
one
s
own
home
so
pleasant
and
if
my
views
on
the
subject
of
hospitality
should
not
at
once
explain
the
difference
between
your
room
and
mine
bluteau
you
will
arrive
at
a
wonderfully
clear
comprehension
of
the
bareness
of
my
room
and
the
untidy
condition
of
my
study
when
you
see
all
the
continual
comings
and
goings
here
mine
is
not
an
indoor
life
to
begin
with
i
am
almost
always
out
of
the
house
and
if
i
stay
at
home
peasants
come
in
at
every
moment
to
speak
to
me
my
body
and
soul
and
house
are
all
theirs
why
should
i
worry
about
social
conventions
in
these
matters
or
trouble
myself
over
the
damage
unintentionally
done
to
floors
and
furniture
by
these
worthy
folk
such
things
can
not
be
helped
luxury
properly
belongs
to
the
boudoir
and
the
to
great
houses
and
chateaux
in
short
as
i
scarcely
do
more
than
sleep
here
what
do
i
want
with
superfluities
of
wealth
you
do
not
know
moreover
how
little
i
care
for
anything
in
this
they
wished
each
other
a
friendly
with
a
warm
shake
of
the
hand
and
went
to
bed
but
before
the
commandant
slept
he
came
to
more
than
one
conclusion
as
to
the
man
who
hour
by
hour
grew
greater
in
his
eyes

ii
a
doctor

round
the
first
thing
next
morning
genestas
went
to
the
stable
drawn
thither
by
the
affection
that
every
man
feels
for
the
horse
that
he
rides
nicolle
s
method
of
rubbing
down
the
animal
was
quite
satisfactory
up
already
commandant
bluteau
cried
benassis
as
he
came
upon
his
guest
you
hear
the
drum
beat
in
the
morning
wherever
you
go
even
in
the
country
you
are
a
regular
soldier
are
you
all
right
replied
genestas
holding
out
his
hand
with
a
friendly
gesture
i
am
never
really
all
right
answered
benassis
half
merrily
half
sadly
did
you
sleep
well
sir
inquired
jacquotte
faith
yes
my
beauty
the
bed
as
you
made
it
was
fit
for
a
jacquotte
s
face
beamed
as
she
followed
her
master
and
his
guest
and
when
she
had
seen
them
seat
themselves
at
table
she
remarked
to
nicolle
he
is
not
a
bad
sort
after
all
that
officer
i
am
sure
he
is
not
he
has
given
me
two
francs
we
will
begin
by
calling
at
two
places
where
there
have
been
deaths
benassis
said
to
his
visitor
as
they
left
the
although
doctors
seldom
deign
to
confront
their
supposed
victims
i
will
take
you
round
to
the
two
houses
where
you
will
be
able
to
make
some
interesting
observations
of
human
nature
and
the
scenes
to
which
you
will
be
a
witness
will
show
you
that
in
the
expression
of
their
feelings
our
folk
among
the
hills
differ
greatly
from
the
dwellers
in
the
lowlands
up
among
the
mountain
peaks
in
our
canton
they
cling
to
customs
that
bear
the
impress
of
an
older
time
and
that
vaguely
recall
scenes
in
the
bible
nature
has
traced
out
a
line
over
our
mountain
ranges
the
whole
appearance
of
the
country
is
different
on
either
side
of
it
you
will
find
strength
of
character
up
above
flexibility
and
quickness
below
they
have
larger
ways
of
regarding
things
among
the
hills
while
the
bent
of
the
lowlands
is
always
towards
the
material
interests
of
existence
i
have
never
seen
a
difference
so
strongly
marked
unless
it
has
been
in
the
val
d
ajou
where
the
northern
side
is
peopled
by
a
tribe
of
idiots
and
the
southern
by
an
intelligent
race
there
is
nothing
but
a
stream
in
the
valley
bottom
to
separate
these
two
populations
which
are
utterly
dissimilar
in
every
respect
as
different
in
face
and
stature
as
in
manners
customs
and
occupation
a
fact
of
this
kind
should
compel
those
who
govern
a
country
to
make
very
extensive
studies
of
local
differences
before
passing
laws
that
are
to
affect
the
great
mass
of
the
people
but
the
horses
are
ready
let
us
start
in
a
short
time
the
two
horsemen
reached
a
house
in
a
part
of
the
township
that
was
overlooked
by
the
mountains
of
the
grande
chartreuse
before
the
door
of
the
dwelling
which
was
fairly
clean
and
tidy
they
saw
a
coffin
set
upon
two
chairs
and
covered
with
a
black
pall
four
tall
candles
stood
about
it
and
on
a
stool
near
by
there
was
a
shallow
brass
dish
full
of
holy
water
in
which
a
branch
of
green
was
steeping
every
went
into
the
yard
knelt
by
the
side
of
the
dead
said
a
and
sprinkled
a
few
drops
of
holy
water
on
the
bier
above
the
black
cloth
that
covered
the
coffin
rose
the
green
sprays
of
a
jessamine
that
grew
beside
the
doorway
and
a
twisted
vine
shoot
already
in
leaf
overran
the
lintel
even
the
saddest
ceremonies
demand
that
things
shall
appear
to
the
best
advantage
and
in
obedience
to
this
requirement
a
young
girl
had
been
sweeping
the
front
of
the
house
the
dead
man
s
eldest
son
a
young
peasant
about
years
of
age
stood
motionless
leaning
against
the
the
tears
in
his
eyes
came
and
went
without
falling
or
perhaps
he
furtively
brushed
them
away
benassis
and
genestas
saw
all
the
details
of
this
scene
as
they
stood
beyond
the
low
wall
they
fastened
their
horses
to
one
of
the
row
of
poplar
trees
that
grew
along
it
and
entered
the
yard
just
as
the
widow
came
out
of
the
byre
a
woman
carrying
a
jug
of
milk
was
with
her
and
spoke
try
to
bear
up
bravely
my
poor
pelletier
she
said
ah
my
dear
after
years
of
life
together
it
is
very
hard
to
lose
your
man
and
her
eyes
brimmed
over
with
tears
will
you
pay
the
two
sous
she
added
after
a
moment
as
she
held
out
her
hand
to
her
neighbor
there
now
i
had
forgotten
about
it
said
the
other
woman
giving
her
the
coin
come
neighbor
don
t
take
on
so
ah
there
is
benassis
well
poor
mother
how
are
you
going
on
a
little
better
asked
the
doctor
she
said
as
the
tears
fell
fast
we
must
go
on
all
the
same
that
is
certain
i
tell
myself
that
my
man
is
out
of
pain
now
he
suffered
so
terribly
but
come
inside
sir
jacques
set
some
chairs
for
these
gentlemen
come
stir
yourself
a
bit
lord
bless
you
if
you
were
to
stop
there
for
a
century
it
would
not
bring
your
poor
father
back
again
and
now
you
will
have
to
do
the
work
of
no
no
good
woman
leave
your
son
alone
we
will
not
sit
down
you
have
a
boy
there
who
will
take
care
of
you
and
who
is
quite
fit
to
take
his
father
s
go
and
change
your
clothes
jacques
cried
the
widow
you
will
be
wanted
well
mother
said
benassis
your
servant
here
you
see
death
is
looked
upon
as
an
event
for
which
every
one
is
prepared
said
the
doctor
it
brings
no
interruption
to
the
course
of
family
life
and
they
will
not
even
wear
mourning
of
any
kind
no
one
cares
to
be
at
the
expense
of
it
they
are
all
either
too
poor
or
too
parsimonious
in
the
villages
hereabouts
so
that
mourning
is
unknown
in
country
districts
yet
the
custom
of
wearing
mourning
is
something
better
than
a
law
or
a
usage
it
is
an
institution
somewhat
akin
to
all
moral
obligations
but
in
spite
of
our
endeavors
neither
janvier
nor
i
have
succeeded
in
making
our
peasants
understand
the
great
importance
of
public
demonstrations
of
feeling
for
the
maintenance
of
social
order
these
good
folk
who
have
only
just
begun
to
think
and
act
for
themselves
are
slow
as
yet
to
grasp
the
changed
conditions
which
should
attach
them
to
these
theories
they
have
only
reached
those
ideas
which
conduce
to
economy
and
to
physical
welfare
in
the
future
if
some
one
else
carries
on
this
work
of
mine
they
will
come
to
understand
the
principles
that
serve
to
uphold
and
preserve
public
order
and
justice
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
not
sufficient
to
be
an
honest
man
you
must
appear
to
be
honest
in
the
eyes
of
others
society
does
not
live
by
moral
ideas
alone
its
existence
depends
upon
actions
in
harmony
with
those
ideas
in
most
country
communes
out
of
a
hundred
families
deprived
by
death
of
their
head
there
are
only
a
few
individuals
capable
of
feeling
more
keenly
than
the
others
who
will
remember
the
deaths
for
very
long
in
a
year
s
time
the
rest
will
have
forgotten
all
about
it
is
not
this
forgetfulness
a
sore
evil
a
religion
is
the
very
heart
of
a
nation
it
expresses
their
feelings
and
their
thoughts
and
exalts
them
by
giving
them
an
object
but
unless
outward
and
visible
honor
is
paid
to
a
god
religion
can
not
exist
and
as
a
consequence
human
ordinances
lose
all
their
force
if
the
conscience
belongs
to
god
and
to
him
only
the
body
is
amenable
to
social
law
is
it
not
therefore
a
first
step
towards
atheism
to
efface
every
sign
of
pious
sorrow
in
this
way
to
neglect
to
impress
on
children
who
are
not
yet
old
enough
to
reflect
and
on
all
other
people
who
stand
in
need
of
example
the
necessity
of
obedience
to
human
law
by
openly
manifested
resignation
to
the
will
of
providence
who
chastens
and
consoles
who
bestows
and
takes
away
worldly
wealth
i
confess
that
after
passing
through
a
period
of
sneering
incredulity
i
have
come
during
my
life
here
to
recognize
the
value
of
the
rites
of
religion
and
of
religious
observances
in
the
family
and
to
discern
the
importance
of
household
customs
and
domestic
festivals
the
family
will
always
be
the
basis
of
human
society
law
and
authority
are
first
felt
there
there
at
any
rate
the
habit
of
obedience
should
be
learned
viewed
in
the
light
of
all
their
consequences
the
spirit
of
the
family
and
paternal
authority
are
two
elements
but
little
developed
as
yet
in
our
new
legislative
system
yet
in
the
family
the
commune
the
department
lies
the
whole
of
our
country
the
laws
ought
therefore
to
be
based
on
these
three
great
divisions
in
my
opinion
marriages
the
birth
of
infants
and
the
deaths
of
heads
of
households
can
not
be
surrounded
with
too
much
circumstance
the
secret
of
the
strength
of
catholicism
and
of
the
deep
root
that
it
has
taken
in
the
ordinary
life
of
man
lies
precisely
in
this
that
it
steps
in
to
invest
every
important
event
in
his
existence
with
a
pomp
that
is
so
naively
touching
and
so
grand
whenever
the
priest
rises
to
the
height
of
his
mission
and
brings
his
office
into
harmony
with
the
sublimity
of
christian
doctrine
once
i
looked
upon
the
catholic
religion
as
a
cleverly
exploited
mass
of
prejudices
and
superstitions
which
an
intelligent
civilization
ought
to
deal
with
according
to
its
desserts
here
i
have
discovered
its
political
necessity
and
its
usefulness
as
a
moral
agent
here
moreover
i
have
come
to
understand
its
power
through
a
knowledge
of
the
actual
thing
which
the
word
expresses
religion
means
a
bond
or
tie
and
certainly
a
cult
or
in
other
words
the
outward
and
visible
form
of
religion
is
the
only
force
that
can
bind
the
various
elements
of
society
together
and
mould
them
into
a
permanent
form
lastly
it
was
also
here
that
i
have
felt
the
soothing
influence
that
religion
sheds
over
the
wounds
of
humanity
and
without
going
further
into
the
subject
i
have
seen
how
admirably
it
is
suited
to
the
fervid
temperaments
of
southern
races
let
us
take
the
road
up
the
hillside
said
the
doctor
interrupting
himself
we
must
reach
the
plateau
up
there
thence
we
shall
look
down
upon
both
valleys
and
you
will
see
a
magnificent
view
the
plateau
lies
three
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
mediterranean
we
shall
see
over
savoy
and
dauphine
and
the
mountain
ranges
of
the
lyonnais
and
rhone
we
shall
be
in
another
commune
a
hill
commune
and
on
a
farm
belonging
to
gravier
you
will
see
the
kind
of
scene
of
which
i
have
spoken
there
the
great
events
of
life
are
invested
with
a
solemnity
which
comes
up
to
my
ideas
mourning
for
the
dead
is
vigorously
prescribed
poor
people
will
beg
in
order
to
purchase
black
clothing
and
no
one
refuses
to
give
in
such
a
case
there
are
few
days
in
which
the
widow
does
not
mention
her
loss
she
always
speaks
of
it
with
tears
and
her
grief
is
as
deep
after
ten
days
of
sorrow
as
on
the
morning
after
her
bereavement
manners
are
patriarchal
the
father
s
authority
is
unlimited
his
word
is
law
he
takes
his
meals
sitting
by
himself
at
the
head
of
the
table
his
wife
and
children
wait
upon
him
and
those
about
him
never
address
him
without
using
certain
respectful
forms
of
speech
while
every
one
remains
standing
and
uncovered
in
his
presence
men
brought
up
in
this
atmosphere
are
conscious
of
their
dignity
to
my
way
of
thinking
it
is
a
noble
education
to
be
brought
up
among
these
customs
and
for
the
most
part
they
are
upright
thrifty
and
hardworking
people
in
this
commune
the
father
of
every
family
when
he
is
old
and
past
work
divides
his
property
equally
among
his
children
and
they
support
him
that
is
the
usual
way
here
an
old
man
of
ninety
in
the
last
century
who
had
divided
everything
he
had
among
his
four
children
went
to
live
with
each
in
turn
for
three
months
in
the
year
as
he
left
the
oldest
to
go
to
the
home
of
a
younger
brother
one
of
his
friends
asked
him
well
are
you
satisfied
with
the
arrangement
faith
yes
the
old
man
answered
they
have
treated
me
as
if
i
had
been
their
own
that
answer
of
his
seemed
so
remarkable
to
an
officer
then
stationed
at
grenoble
that
he
repeated
it
in
more
than
one
parisian
salon
that
officer
was
the
celebrated
moralist
vauvenargues
and
in
this
way
the
beautiful
saying
came
to
the
knowledge
of
another
writer
named
chamfort
ah
still
more
forcible
phrases
are
often
struck
out
among
us
but
they
lack
a
historian
worthy
of
i
have
come
across
moravians
and
lollards
in
bohemia
and
hungary
said
genestas
they
are
a
kind
of
people
something
like
your
mountaineers
good
folk
who
endure
the
sufferings
of
war
with
angelic
men
living
under
simple
and
natural
conditions
are
bound
to
be
almost
alike
in
all
countries
sincerity
of
life
takes
but
one
form
it
is
true
that
a
country
life
often
extinguishes
thought
of
a
wider
kind
but
evil
propensities
are
weakened
and
good
qualities
are
developed
by
it
in
fact
the
fewer
the
numbers
of
the
human
beings
collected
together
in
a
place
the
less
crime
evil
thinking
and
general
bad
behavior
will
be
found
in
it
a
pure
atmosphere
counts
for
a
good
deal
in
purity
of
the
two
horsemen
who
had
been
climbing
the
stony
road
at
a
foot
pace
now
reached
the
level
space
of
which
benassis
had
spoken
it
is
a
strip
of
land
lying
round
about
the
base
of
a
lofty
mountain
peak
a
bare
surface
of
rock
with
no
growth
of
any
kind
upon
it
deep
clefts
are
riven
in
its
sheer
inaccessible
sides
the
gray
crest
of
the
summit
towers
above
the
ledge
of
fertile
soil
which
lies
around
it
a
domain
sometimes
narrower
sometimes
wider
and
altogether
about
a
hundred
acres
in
extent
here
through
a
vast
break
in
the
line
of
the
hills
to
the
south
the
eye
sees
french
maurienne
dauphine
the
crags
of
savoy
and
the
mountains
of
the
lyonnais
genestas
was
gazing
from
this
point
over
a
land
that
lay
far
and
wide
in
the
spring
sunlight
when
there
arose
the
sound
of
a
wailing
cry
let
us
go
on
said
benassis
the
wail
for
the
dead
has
begun
that
is
the
name
they
give
to
this
part
of
the
funeral
on
the
western
slope
of
the
mountain
peak
the
commandant
saw
the
buildings
belonging
to
a
farm
of
some
size
the
whole
place
formed
a
perfect
square
the
gateway
consisted
of
a
granite
arch
impressive
in
its
solidity
which
added
to
the
appearance
of
the
buildings
with
the
ancient
trees
that
stood
about
them
and
the
growth
of
plant
life
on
the
roofs
the
house
itself
lay
at
the
farther
end
of
the
yard
barns
sheepfolds
stables
cowsheds
and
other
buildings
lay
on
either
side
and
in
the
midst
was
the
great
pool
where
the
manure
had
been
laid
to
rot
on
a
thriving
farm
such
a
yard
as
this
is
usually
full
of
life
and
movement
but
it
was
silent
and
deserted
the
poultry
was
shut
up
the
cattle
were
all
in
the
byres
there
was
scarcely
a
sound
of
animal
life
both
stables
and
cowsheds
had
been
carefully
swept
across
the
yard
the
perfect
neatness
which
reigned
in
a
place
where
everything
as
a
rule
was
in
disorder
the
absence
of
stirring
life
the
stillness
in
so
noisy
a
spot
the
calm
serenity
of
the
hills
the
deep
shadow
cast
by
the
towering
peak
everything
combined
to
make
a
strong
impression
on
the
mind
genestas
was
accustomed
to
painful
scenes
yet
he
could
not
help
shuddering
as
he
saw
a
dozen
men
and
women
standing
weeping
outside
the
door
of
the
great
hall
master
is
dead
they
wailed
the
unison
of
voices
gave
appalling
effect
to
the
words
which
they
repeated
twice
during
the
time
required
to
cross
the
space
between
the
gateway
and
the
farmhouse
door
to
this
wailing
lament
succeeded
moans
from
within
the
house
the
sound
of
a
woman
s
voice
came
through
the
casements
i
dare
not
intrude
upon
such
grief
as
this
said
genestas
to
benassis
i
always
go
to
visit
a
bereaved
family
the
doctor
answered
either
to
certify
the
death
or
to
see
that
no
mischance
caused
by
grief
has
befallen
the
living
you
need
not
hesitate
to
come
with
me
the
scene
is
impressive
and
there
will
be
such
a
great
many
people
that
no
one
will
notice
your
as
genestas
followed
the
doctor
he
found
in
fact
that
the
first
room
was
full
of
relations
of
the
dead
they
passed
through
the
crowd
and
stationed
themselves
at
the
door
of
a
bedroom
that
opened
out
of
the
great
hall
which
served
the
whole
family
for
a
kitchen
and
a
the
whole
colony
it
should
rather
be
called
for
the
great
length
of
the
table
showed
that
some
forty
people
lived
in
the
house
benassis
arrival
interrupted
the
discourse
of
a
tall
woman
with
thin
locks
of
hair
who
held
the
dead
man
s
hand
in
hers
in
a
way
that
spoke
eloquently
the
dead
master
of
the
house
had
been
arrayed
in
his
best
clothes
and
now
lay
stretched
out
cold
and
stiff
upon
the
bed
they
had
drawn
the
curtains
aside
the
thought
of
heaven
seemed
to
brood
over
the
quiet
face
and
the
white
hair
it
was
like
the
closing
scene
of
a
drama
on
either
side
of
the
bed
stood
the
children
and
the
nearest
relations
of
the
husband
and
wife
these
last
stood
in
a
line
on
either
side
the
wife
s
kin
upon
the
left
and
those
of
her
husband
on
the
right
both
men
and
women
were
kneeling
in
prayer
and
almost
all
of
them
were
in
tears
tall
candles
stood
about
the
bed
the
cure
of
the
parish
and
his
assistants
had
taken
their
places
in
the
middle
of
the
room
beside
the
bier
there
was
something
tragical
about
the
scene
with
the
head
of
the
family
lying
before
the
coffin
which
was
waiting
to
be
closed
down
upon
him
forever
ah
cried
the
widow
turning
as
she
saw
benassis
if
the
skill
of
the
best
of
men
could
not
save
you
my
dear
lord
it
was
because
it
was
ordained
in
heaven
that
you
should
precede
me
to
the
tomb
yes
this
hand
of
yours
that
used
to
press
mine
so
kindly
is
cold
i
have
lost
my
dear
helpmate
for
ever
and
our
household
has
lost
its
beloved
head
for
truly
you
were
the
guide
of
us
all
alas
there
is
not
one
of
those
who
are
weeping
with
me
who
has
not
known
all
the
worth
of
your
nature
and
felt
the
light
of
your
soul
but
i
alone
knew
all
the
patience
and
the
kindness
of
your
heart
oh
my
husband
my
husband
must
i
bid
you
farewell
for
ever
farewell
to
you
our
stay
and
support
farewell
to
you
my
dear
master
and
we
your
children
for
to
each
of
us
you
gave
the
same
fatherly
love
all
we
your
children
have
lost
our
father
the
widow
flung
herself
upon
the
dead
body
and
clasped
it
in
a
tight
embrace
as
if
her
kisses
and
the
tears
with
which
she
covered
it
could
give
it
warmth
again
during
the
pause
came
the
wail
of
the
servants
master
is
dead
yes
the
widow
went
on
he
is
dead
our
beloved
who
gave
us
our
bread
who
sowed
and
reaped
for
us
who
watched
over
our
happiness
who
guided
us
through
life
who
ruled
so
kindly
among
us
i
may
speak
in
his
praise
and
say
that
he
never
caused
me
the
slightest
sorrow
he
was
good
and
strong
and
patient
even
while
we
were
torturing
him
for
the
sake
of
his
health
so
precious
to
us
let
it
be
children
it
is
all
no
use
the
dear
lamb
said
just
in
the
same
tone
of
voice
with
which
he
had
said
everything
is
all
right
friends
only
a
few
days
before
ah
a
few
days
ago
a
few
days
have
been
enough
to
take
away
the
gladness
from
our
house
and
to
darken
our
lives
to
close
the
eyes
of
the
best
most
upright
most
revered
of
men
no
one
could
plow
as
he
could
night
or
day
he
would
go
about
over
the
mountains
he
feared
nothing
and
when
he
came
back
he
had
always
a
smile
for
his
wife
and
children
ah
he
was
our
beloved
it
was
dull
here
by
the
fireside
when
was
away
and
our
food
lost
all
its
relish
oh
how
will
it
be
now
when
our
guardian
angel
will
be
laid
away
under
the
earth
and
we
shall
never
see
him
any
more
never
any
more
dear
kinsfolk
and
friends
never
any
more
my
children
yes
my
children
have
lost
their
kind
father
our
relations
and
friends
have
lost
their
good
kinsman
and
their
trusty
friend
the
household
has
lost
its
master
and
i
have
lost
everything
she
took
the
hand
of
the
dead
again
and
knelt
so
that
she
might
press
her
face
close
to
his
as
she
kissed
it
the
servants
cry
master
is
dead
was
again
repeated
three
times
just
then
the
eldest
son
came
to
his
mother
to
say
the
people
from
have
just
come
mother
we
want
some
wine
for
take
the
keys
she
said
in
a
low
tone
and
in
a
different
voice
from
that
in
which
she
had
just
expressed
her
grief
you
are
the
master
of
the
house
my
son
see
that
they
receive
the
welcome
that
your
father
would
have
given
them
do
not
let
them
find
any
change
let
me
have
one
more
long
look
she
went
on
but
alas
my
good
husband
you
do
not
feel
my
presence
now
i
can
not
bring
back
warmth
to
you
i
only
wish
that
i
could
comfort
you
still
could
let
you
know
that
so
long
as
i
live
you
will
dwell
in
the
heart
that
you
made
glad
could
tell
you
that
i
shall
be
happy
in
the
memory
of
my
happiness
that
the
dear
thought
of
you
will
live
on
in
this
room
yes
as
long
as
god
spares
me
this
room
shall
be
filled
with
memories
of
you
hear
my
vow
dear
husband
your
couch
shall
always
remain
as
it
is
now
i
will
sleep
in
it
no
more
since
you
are
dead
henceforward
while
i
live
it
shall
be
cold
and
empty
with
you
i
have
lost
all
that
makes
a
woman
her
master
husband
father
friend
companion
and
helpmate
i
have
lost
all
master
is
dead
the
servants
wailed
others
raised
the
cry
and
the
lament
became
general
the
widow
took
a
pair
of
scissors
that
hung
at
her
waist
cut
off
her
hair
and
laid
the
locks
in
her
husband
s
hand
deep
silence
fell
on
them
all
that
act
means
that
she
will
not
marry
again
said
benassis
this
determination
was
expected
by
many
of
the
take
it
dear
lord
she
said
her
emotion
brought
a
tremor
to
her
voice
that
went
to
the
hearts
of
all
who
heard
her
i
have
sworn
to
be
faithful
i
give
this
pledge
to
you
to
keep
in
the
grave
we
shall
thus
be
united
for
ever
and
through
love
of
your
children
i
will
live
on
among
the
family
in
whom
you
used
to
feel
yourself
young
again
oh
that
you
could
hear
me
my
husband
the
pride
and
joy
of
my
heart
oh
that
you
could
know
that
all
my
power
to
live
now
you
are
dead
will
yet
come
from
you
for
i
shall
live
to
carry
out
your
sacred
wishes
and
to
honor
your
benassis
pressed
genestas
hand
as
an
invitation
to
follow
him
and
they
went
out
by
this
time
the
first
room
was
full
of
people
who
had
come
from
another
mountain
commune
all
of
them
waited
in
meditative
silence
as
if
the
sorrow
and
grief
that
brooded
over
the
house
had
already
taken
possession
of
them
as
benassis
and
the
commandant
crossed
the
threshold
they
overheard
a
few
words
that
passed
between
one
of
the
newcomers
and
the
eldest
son
of
the
late
owner
then
when
did
he
die
oh
exclaimed
the
eldest
son
a
man
of
years
of
age
i
did
not
see
him
die
he
asked
for
me
and
i
was
not
there
his
voice
was
broken
with
sobs
but
he
went
on
he
said
to
me
the
night
before
you
must
go
over
to
the
town
my
boy
and
pay
our
taxes
my
funeral
will
put
that
out
of
your
minds
and
we
shall
be
behindhand
a
thing
that
has
never
happened
it
seemed
the
best
thing
to
do
so
i
went
and
while
i
was
gone
he
died
and
i
never
received
his
last
embrace
i
have
always
been
at
his
side
but
he
did
not
see
me
near
him
at
the
last
in
my
place
where
i
had
always
master
is
dead
alas
he
is
dead
and
i
was
not
there
to
receive
his
last
words
and
his
latest
sigh
and
what
did
the
taxes
matter
would
it
not
have
been
better
to
lose
all
our
money
than
to
leave
home
just
then
could
all
that
we
have
make
up
to
me
for
the
loss
of
his
last
farewell
no
dieu
if
father
falls
ill
jean
do
not
go
away
and
leave
him
or
you
will
lay
up
a
lifelong
regret
for
my
friend
said
genestas
i
have
seen
thousands
of
men
die
on
the
battlefield
death
did
not
wait
to
let
their
children
bid
them
farewell
take
comfort
you
are
not
the
only
but
a
father
who
was
such
a
good
man
he
replied
bursting
into
fresh
tears
benassis
took
genestas
in
the
direction
of
the
farm
buildings
the
funeral
oration
will
only
cease
when
the
body
has
been
laid
in
its
coffin
said
the
doctor
and
the
weeping
woman
s
language
will
grow
more
vivid
and
impassioned
all
the
while
but
a
woman
only
acquires
the
right
to
speak
in
such
a
strain
before
so
imposing
an
audience
by
a
blameless
life
if
the
widow
could
reproach
herself
with
the
smallest
of
shortcomings
she
would
not
dare
to
utter
a
word
for
if
she
did
she
would
pronounce
her
own
condemnation
she
would
be
at
the
same
time
her
own
accuser
and
judge
is
there
not
something
sublime
in
this
custom
which
thus
judges
the
living
and
the
dead
they
only
begin
to
wear
mourning
after
a
week
has
elapsed
when
it
is
publicly
worn
at
a
meeting
of
all
the
family
their
near
relations
spend
the
week
with
the
widow
and
children
to
help
them
to
set
their
affairs
in
order
and
to
console
them
a
family
gathering
at
such
a
time
produces
a
great
effect
on
the
minds
of
the
mourners
the
consideration
for
others
which
possesses
men
when
they
are
brought
into
close
contact
acts
as
a
restraint
on
violent
grief
on
the
last
day
when
the
mourning
garb
has
been
assumed
a
solemn
banquet
is
given
and
their
relations
take
leave
of
them
all
this
is
taken
very
seriously
any
one
who
was
slack
in
fulfilling
his
duties
after
the
death
of
the
head
of
a
family
would
have
no
one
at
his
own
the
doctor
had
reached
the
cowhouse
as
he
spoke
he
opened
the
door
and
made
the
commandant
enter
that
he
might
show
it
to
him
all
our
cowhouses
have
been
rebuilt
after
this
pattern
captain
look
is
it
not
magnificent
genestas
could
not
help
admiring
the
huge
place
the
cows
and
oxen
stood
in
two
rows
with
their
tails
towards
the
side
walls
and
their
heads
in
the
middle
of
the
shed
access
to
the
stalls
was
afforded
by
a
fairly
wide
space
between
them
and
the
wall
you
could
see
their
horned
heads
and
shining
eyes
through
the
lattice
work
so
that
it
was
easy
for
the
master
to
run
his
eyes
over
the
cattle
the
fodder
was
placed
on
some
staging
erected
above
the
stalls
so
that
it
fell
into
the
racks
below
without
waste
of
labor
or
material
there
was
a
space
down
the
centre
which
was
kept
clean
and
ventilated
by
a
thorough
draught
of
air
in
the
winter
time
benassis
said
as
he
walked
with
genestas
down
the
middle
of
the
cowhouse
both
men
and
women
do
their
work
here
together
in
the
evenings
the
tables
are
set
out
here
and
in
this
way
the
people
keep
themselves
warm
without
going
to
any
expense
the
sheep
are
housed
in
the
same
way
you
would
not
believe
how
quickly
the
beasts
fall
into
orderly
ways
i
have
often
wondered
to
see
them
come
in
each
knows
her
proper
place
and
allows
those
who
take
precedence
to
pass
in
before
her
look
there
is
just
room
enough
in
each
stall
to
do
the
milking
and
to
rub
the
cattle
down
and
the
floor
slopes
a
little
to
facilitate
one
can
judge
of
everything
else
from
the
sight
of
this
cowhouse
said
genestas
without
flattery
these
are
great
results
indeed
we
have
had
some
trouble
to
bring
them
about
benassis
answered
but
then
see
what
fine
cattle
they
are
they
are
splendid
beasts
certainly
you
had
good
reason
to
praise
them
to
me
answered
genestas
now
said
the
doctor
when
he
had
mounted
his
horse
and
passed
under
the
gateway
we
are
going
over
some
of
the
newly
cleared
waste
and
through
the
corn
land
i
have
christened
this
little
corner
of
our
commune
la
for
about
an
hour
they
rode
at
a
foot
pace
across
fields
in
a
state
of
high
cultivation
on
which
the
soldier
complimented
the
doctor
then
they
came
down
the
mountain
side
into
the
township
again
talking
whenever
the
pace
of
their
horses
allowed
them
to
do
so
at
last
they
reached
a
narrow
glen
down
which
they
rode
into
the
main
valley
i
promised
yesterday
benassis
said
to
genestas
to
show
you
one
of
the
two
soldiers
who
left
the
army
and
came
back
to
us
after
the
fall
of
napoleon
we
shall
find
him
somewhere
hereabouts
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
mountain
streams
flow
into
a
sort
of
natural
reservoir
or
tarn
up
here
the
earth
they
bring
down
has
silted
it
up
and
he
is
engaged
in
clearing
it
out
but
if
you
are
to
take
any
interest
in
the
man
i
must
tell
you
his
history
his
name
is
gondrin
he
was
only
eighteen
years
old
when
he
was
drawn
in
the
great
conscription
of
and
drafted
into
a
corps
of
gunners
he
served
as
a
private
soldier
in
napoleon
s
campaigns
in
italy
followed
him
to
egypt
and
came
back
from
the
east
after
the
peace
of
amiens
in
the
time
of
the
empire
he
was
incorporated
in
the
pontoon
troop
of
the
guard
and
was
constantly
on
active
service
in
germany
lastly
the
poor
fellow
made
the
russian
we
are
then
to
some
extent
said
genestas
i
have
made
the
same
campaigns
only
an
iron
frame
would
stand
the
tricks
played
by
so
many
different
climates
my
word
for
it
those
who
are
still
standing
on
their
stumps
after
marching
over
italy
egypt
germany
portugal
and
russia
must
have
applied
to
providence
and
taken
out
a
patent
for
just
so
you
will
see
a
solid
fragment
of
a
man
answered
benassis
you
know
all
about
the
retreat
from
moscow
it
is
useless
to
tell
you
about
it
this
man
i
have
told
you
of
is
one
of
the
pontooners
of
the
beresina
he
helped
to
construct
the
bridge
by
which
the
army
made
the
passage
and
stood
in
water
to
drive
in
the
first
piles
general
eble
who
was
in
command
of
the
pontooners
could
only
find
men
who
were
plucky
enough
in
gondrin
s
phrase
to
tackle
that
business
the
general
himself
came
down
to
the
stream
to
hearten
and
cheer
the
men
promising
each
of
them
a
pension
of
a
thousand
francs
and
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
the
first
who
went
down
into
the
beresina
had
his
leg
taken
off
by
a
block
of
ice
and
the
man
himself
was
washed
away
but
you
will
better
understand
the
difficulty
of
the
task
when
you
hear
the
end
of
the
story
of
the
volunteers
gondrin
is
the
only
one
alive
of
them
lost
their
lives
in
the
beresina
and
the
two
others
died
miserably
in
a
polish
hospital
the
poor
fellow
himself
only
returned
from
wilna
in
to
find
the
bourbons
restored
to
power
general
eble
of
whom
gondrin
can
not
speak
without
tears
in
his
eyes
was
dead
the
pontooner
was
deaf
and
his
health
was
shattered
and
as
he
could
neither
read
nor
write
he
found
no
one
left
to
help
him
or
to
plead
his
cause
he
begged
his
way
to
paris
and
while
there
made
application
at
the
war
office
not
for
the
thousand
francs
of
extra
pension
which
had
been
promised
to
him
nor
yet
for
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
but
only
for
the
bare
pension
due
to
him
after
years
of
service
and
i
do
not
know
how
many
campaigns
he
did
not
obtain
his
pension
or
his
traveling
expenses
he
did
not
even
receive
his
arrears
of
pay
he
spent
a
year
in
making
fruitless
solicitations
holding
out
his
hands
in
vain
to
those
whom
he
had
saved
and
at
the
end
of
it
he
came
back
here
sorely
disheartened
but
resigned
to
his
fate
this
hero
unknown
to
fame
does
draining
work
on
the
land
for
which
he
is
paid
ten
sous
the
fathom
he
is
accustomed
to
working
in
a
marshy
soil
and
so
as
he
says
he
gets
jobs
which
no
one
else
cares
to
take
he
can
make
about
three
francs
a
day
by
clearing
out
ponds
or
draining
meadows
that
lie
under
water
his
deafness
makes
him
seem
surly
and
he
is
not
naturally
inclined
to
say
very
much
but
there
is
a
good
deal
in
him
we
are
very
good
friends
he
dines
with
me
on
the
day
of
austerlitz
on
the
emperor
s
birthday
and
on
the
anniversary
of
the
disaster
at
waterloo
and
during
the
dessert
he
always
receives
a
napoleon
to
pay
for
his
wine
very
quarter
every
one
in
the
commune
shares
in
my
feeling
of
respect
for
him
if
he
would
allow
them
to
support
him
nothing
would
please
them
better
at
every
house
to
which
he
goes
the
people
follow
my
example
and
show
their
esteem
by
asking
him
to
dine
with
them
it
is
a
feeling
of
pride
that
leads
him
to
work
and
it
is
only
as
a
portrait
of
the
emperor
that
he
can
be
induced
to
take
my
piece
he
has
been
deeply
wounded
by
the
injustice
that
has
been
done
to
him
but
i
think
regret
for
the
cross
is
greater
than
the
desire
for
his
pension
he
has
one
great
consolation
after
the
bridges
had
been
constructed
across
the
beresina
general
eble
presented
such
of
the
pontooners
as
were
not
disabled
to
the
emperor
and
napoleon
embraced
poor
gondrin
perhaps
but
for
that
accolade
he
would
have
died
ere
now
this
memory
and
the
hope
that
some
day
napoleon
will
return
are
all
that
gondrin
lives
by
nothing
will
ever
persuade
him
that
napoleon
is
dead
and
so
convinced
is
he
that
the
emperor
s
captivity
is
wholly
and
solely
due
to
the
english
that
i
believe
he
would
be
ready
on
the
slightest
pretext
to
take
the
life
of
the
alderman
that
ever
traveled
for
pleasure
in
foreign
let
us
go
on
as
fast
as
possible
cried
genestas
he
had
listened
to
the
doctor
s
story
with
rapt
attention
and
now
seemed
to
recover
consciousness
of
his
surroundings
let
us
hurry
i
long
to
see
that
man
both
of
them
put
their
horses
to
a
gallop
the
other
soldier
that
i
spoke
of
benassis
went
on
is
another
of
those
men
of
iron
who
have
knocked
about
everywhere
with
our
armies
his
life
like
that
of
all
french
soldiers
has
been
made
up
of
bullets
sabre
strokes
and
victories
he
has
had
a
very
rough
time
of
it
and
has
only
worn
the
woolen
epaulettes
he
has
a
fanatical
affection
for
napoleon
who
conferred
the
cross
upon
him
on
the
field
of
valontina
he
is
of
a
jovial
turn
of
mind
and
like
a
genuine
dauphinois
has
always
looked
after
his
own
interests
has
his
pension
and
the
honors
of
the
legion
goguelat
is
his
name
he
was
an
infantry
man
who
exchanged
into
the
guard
in
he
is
gondrin
s
better
half
so
to
speak
for
the
two
have
taken
up
house
together
they
both
lodge
with
a
peddler
s
widow
and
make
over
their
money
to
her
she
is
a
kind
soul
who
boards
them
and
looks
after
them
and
their
clothes
as
if
they
were
her
children
in
his
quality
of
local
postman
goguelat
carries
all
the
news
of
the
countryside
and
a
good
deal
of
practice
acquired
in
this
way
has
made
him
an
orator
in
great
request
at
and
the
champion
teller
of
stories
in
the
district
gondrin
looks
upon
him
as
a
very
knowing
fellow
and
something
of
a
wit
and
whenever
goguelat
talks
about
napoleon
his
comrade
seems
to
understand
what
he
is
saying
from
the
movement
of
his
lips
there
will
be
an
as
they
call
it
in
one
of
my
barns
if
these
two
come
over
to
it
and
we
can
manage
to
see
without
being
seen
i
shall
treat
you
to
a
view
of
the
spectacle
but
here
we
are
close
to
the
ditch
and
i
do
not
see
my
friend
the
the
doctor
and
the
commandant
looked
everywhere
about
them
gondrin
s
soldier
s
coat
lay
there
beside
a
heap
of
black
mud
and
his
wheelbarrow
spade
and
pickaxe
were
visible
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
man
himself
along
the
various
pebbly
watercourses
for
the
wayward
mountain
streams
had
hollowed
out
channels
that
were
almost
overgrown
with
low
bushes
he
can
not
be
so
very
far
away
gondrin
where
are
you
shouted
benassis
genestas
first
saw
the
curling
smoke
from
a
tobacco
pipe
rise
among
the
brushwood
on
a
bank
of
rubbish
not
far
away
he
pointed
it
out
to
the
doctor
who
shouted
again
the
old
pontooner
raised
his
head
at
this
recognized
the
mayor
and
came
towards
them
down
a
little
pathway
well
old
friend
said
benassis
making
a
sort
of
with
his
hand
here
is
a
comrade
of
yours
who
was
out
in
egypt
come
to
see
gondrin
raised
is
face
at
once
and
gave
genestas
a
swift
keen
and
searching
look
one
of
those
glances
by
which
old
soldiers
are
wont
at
once
to
take
the
measure
of
any
impending
danger
he
saw
the
red
ribbon
that
the
commandant
wore
and
made
a
silent
and
respectful
military
salute
if
the
little
corporal
were
alive
the
officer
cried
you
would
have
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
a
handsome
pension
besides
for
every
man
who
wore
epaulettes
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
owed
his
life
to
you
on
the
of
october
but
i
am
not
the
minister
of
war
my
friend
the
commandant
added
as
he
dismounted
and
with
a
sudden
rush
of
feeling
he
grasped
the
laborer
s
hand
the
old
pontooner
drew
himself
up
at
the
words
he
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
i
only
did
my
duty
sir
he
said
with
his
head
bent
down
but
others
have
not
done
their
duty
by
me
they
asked
for
my
papers
why
the
bulletin
i
told
them
must
do
instead
of
my
papers
but
you
must
make
another
application
comrade
you
are
bound
to
have
justice
done
you
in
these
days
if
influence
is
brought
to
bear
in
the
right
justice
cried
the
veteran
the
doctor
and
the
commandant
shuddered
at
the
tone
in
which
he
spoke
in
the
brief
pause
that
followed
both
the
horsemen
looked
at
the
man
before
them
who
seemed
like
a
fragment
of
the
wreck
of
great
armies
which
napoleon
had
filled
with
men
of
bronze
sought
out
from
among
three
generations
gondrin
was
certainly
a
splendid
specimen
of
that
seemingly
indestructible
mass
of
men
which
might
be
cut
to
pieces
but
never
gave
way
the
old
man
was
scarcely
five
feet
high
wide
across
the
shoulders
and
his
face
was
sunburned
furrowed
with
deep
wrinkles
but
the
outlines
were
still
firm
in
spite
of
the
hollows
in
it
and
one
could
see
even
now
that
it
was
the
face
of
a
soldier
it
was
a
countenance
his
forehead
seemed
like
a
block
of
granite
but
there
was
a
weary
expression
about
his
face
and
the
gray
hairs
hung
scantily
about
his
head
as
if
life
were
waning
there
already
everything
about
him
indicated
unusual
strength
his
arms
were
covered
thickly
with
hair
and
so
was
the
chest
which
was
visible
through
the
opening
of
his
coarse
shirt
in
spite
of
his
almost
crooked
legs
he
held
himself
firm
and
erect
as
if
nothing
could
shake
him
justice
he
said
once
more
there
will
never
be
justice
for
the
like
of
us
we
can
not
send
bailiffs
to
the
government
to
demand
our
dues
for
us
and
as
the
wallet
must
be
filled
somehow
he
said
striking
his
stomach
we
can
not
afford
to
wait
moreover
these
gentry
who
lead
snug
lives
in
government
offices
may
talk
and
talk
but
their
words
are
not
good
to
eat
so
i
have
come
back
here
again
to
draw
my
pay
out
of
the
commonalty
he
said
striking
the
mud
with
his
spade
things
must
not
be
left
in
that
way
old
comrade
said
genestas
i
owe
my
life
to
you
and
it
would
be
ungrateful
of
me
if
i
did
not
lend
you
a
hand
i
have
not
forgotten
the
passage
over
the
bridges
in
the
beresina
and
it
is
fresh
in
the
memories
of
some
brave
fellows
of
my
acquaintance
they
will
back
me
up
and
the
nation
shall
give
you
the
recognition
you
you
will
be
called
a
bonapartist
please
do
not
meddle
in
the
matter
sir
i
have
gone
to
the
rear
now
and
i
have
dropped
into
my
hole
here
like
a
spent
bullet
but
after
riding
on
camels
through
the
desert
and
drinking
my
glass
by
the
fireside
in
moscow
i
never
thought
that
i
should
come
back
to
die
here
beneath
the
trees
that
my
father
planted
and
he
began
to
work
again
poor
old
man
said
genestas
as
they
turned
to
go
i
should
do
the
same
if
i
were
in
his
place
we
have
lost
our
father
everything
seems
dark
to
me
now
that
i
have
seen
that
man
s
hopelessness
he
went
on
addressing
benassis
he
does
not
know
how
much
i
am
interested
in
him
and
he
will
think
that
i
am
one
of
those
gilded
rascals
who
can
not
feel
for
a
soldier
s
he
turned
quickly
and
went
back
grasped
the
veteran
s
hand
and
spoke
loudly
in
his
ear
i
swear
by
the
cross
i
wear
the
cross
of
honor
it
used
to
be
that
i
will
do
all
that
man
can
do
to
obtain
your
pension
for
you
even
if
i
have
to
swallow
a
dozen
refusals
from
the
minister
and
to
petition
the
king
and
the
dauphin
and
the
whole
shop
old
gondrin
quivered
as
he
heard
the
words
he
looked
hard
at
genestas
and
said
haven
t
you
served
in
the
ranks
the
commandant
nodded
the
pontooner
wiped
his
hand
and
took
that
of
genestas
which
he
grasped
warmly
and
said
i
made
the
army
a
present
of
my
life
general
when
i
waded
out
into
the
river
yonder
and
if
i
am
still
alive
it
is
all
so
much
to
the
good
one
moment
do
you
care
to
see
to
the
bottom
of
it
well
then
ever
since
was
pulled
down
from
his
place
i
have
ceased
to
care
about
anything
and
after
all
he
went
on
cheerfully
as
he
pointed
to
the
land
they
have
made
over
twenty
thousand
francs
to
me
here
and
i
am
taking
it
out
in
detail
as
used
to
say
well
then
comrade
said
genestas
touched
by
the
grandeur
of
this
forgiveness
at
least
you
shall
have
the
only
thing
that
you
can
not
prevent
me
from
giving
to
you
here
the
commandant
tapped
his
heart
looked
once
more
at
the
old
pontooner
mounted
his
horse
again
and
went
his
way
side
by
side
with
benassis
such
cruelty
as
this
on
the
part
of
the
government
foments
the
strife
between
rich
and
poor
said
the
doctor
people
who
exercise
a
little
brief
authority
have
never
given
a
serious
thought
to
the
consequences
that
must
follow
an
act
of
injustice
done
to
a
man
of
the
people
it
is
true
that
a
poor
man
who
needs
must
work
for
his
daily
bread
can
not
long
keep
up
the
struggle
but
he
can
talk
and
his
words
find
an
echo
in
every
sufferer
s
heart
so
that
one
bad
case
of
this
kind
is
multiplied
for
every
one
who
hears
of
it
feels
it
as
a
personal
wrong
and
the
leaven
works
even
this
is
not
so
serious
but
something
far
worse
comes
of
it
among
the
people
these
causes
of
injustice
bring
about
a
chronic
state
of
smothered
hatred
for
their
social
superiors
the
middle
class
becomes
the
poor
man
s
enemy
they
lie
without
the
bounds
of
his
moral
code
he
tells
lies
to
them
and
robs
them
without
scruple
indeed
theft
ceases
to
be
a
crime
or
a
misdemeanor
and
is
looked
upon
as
an
act
of
vengeance
when
an
official
who
ought
to
see
that
the
poor
have
justice
done
them
uses
them
ill
and
cheats
them
of
their
due
how
can
we
expect
the
poor
starving
wretches
to
bear
their
troubles
meekly
and
to
respect
the
rights
of
property
it
makes
me
shudder
to
think
that
some
understrapper
whose
business
it
is
to
dust
papers
in
a
government
office
has
pocketed
gondrin
s
promised
thousand
francs
of
pension
and
yet
there
are
folk
who
never
having
measured
the
excess
of
the
people
s
sufferings
accuse
the
people
of
excess
in
the
day
of
their
vengeance
when
a
government
has
done
more
harm
than
good
to
individuals
its
further
existence
depends
on
the
merest
accident
the
masses
square
the
account
after
their
fashion
by
upsetting
it
a
statesman
ought
always
to
imagine
justice
with
the
poor
at
her
feet
for
justice
was
only
invented
for
the
when
they
had
come
within
the
compass
of
the
township
benassis
saw
two
people
walking
along
the
road
in
front
of
them
and
turned
to
his
companion
who
had
been
absorbed
for
some
time
in
thought
you
have
seen
a
veteran
soldier
resigned
to
his
life
of
wretchedness
and
now
you
are
about
to
see
an
old
agricultural
laborer
who
is
submitting
to
the
same
lot
the
man
there
ahead
of
us
has
dug
and
sown
and
toiled
for
others
all
his
genestas
looked
and
saw
an
old
laborer
making
his
way
along
the
road
in
company
with
an
aged
woman
he
seemed
to
be
afflicted
with
some
form
of
sciatica
and
limped
painfully
along
his
feet
were
encased
in
a
wretched
pair
of
sabots
and
a
sort
of
wallet
hung
over
his
shoulder
several
tools
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
bag
their
handles
blackened
with
long
use
and
the
sweat
of
toil
rattled
audibly
together
while
the
other
end
of
the
wallet
behind
his
shoulder
held
bread
some
walnuts
and
a
few
fresh
onions
his
legs
seemed
to
be
warped
as
it
were
his
back
was
bent
by
continual
toil
he
stooped
so
much
as
he
walked
that
he
leaned
on
a
long
stick
to
steady
himself
his
hair
escaped
from
under
a
battered
hat
grown
rusty
by
exposure
to
all
sorts
of
weather
and
mended
here
and
there
with
visible
stitches
of
white
thread
his
clothes
made
of
a
kind
of
rough
canvas
were
a
mass
of
patches
of
contrasting
colors
this
piece
of
humanity
in
ruins
lacked
none
of
the
characteristics
that
appeal
to
our
hearts
when
we
see
ruins
of
other
kinds
his
wife
held
herself
somewhat
more
erect
her
clothing
was
likewise
a
mass
of
rags
and
the
cap
that
she
wore
was
of
the
coarsest
materials
on
her
back
she
carried
a
rough
earthen
jar
by
means
of
a
thong
passed
through
the
handles
of
the
great
pitcher
which
was
round
in
shape
and
flattened
at
the
sides
they
both
looked
up
when
they
heard
the
horses
approaching
saw
that
it
was
benassis
and
stopped
the
man
had
worked
till
he
was
almost
past
work
and
his
faithful
helpmate
was
no
less
broken
with
toil
it
was
painful
to
see
how
the
summer
sun
and
the
winter
s
cold
had
blackened
their
faces
and
covered
them
with
such
deep
wrinkles
that
their
features
were
hardly
discernible
it
was
not
their
life
history
that
had
been
engraven
on
their
faces
but
it
might
be
gathered
from
their
attitude
and
bearing
incessant
toil
had
been
the
lot
of
both
they
had
worked
and
suffered
together
they
had
had
many
troubles
and
few
joys
to
share
and
now
like
captives
grown
accustomed
to
their
prison
they
seemed
to
be
too
familiar
with
wretchedness
to
heed
it
and
to
take
everything
as
it
came
yet
a
certain
frank
was
not
lacking
in
their
faces
and
on
a
closer
view
their
monotonous
life
the
lot
of
so
many
a
poor
creature
seemed
an
enviable
one
trouble
had
set
its
unmistakable
mark
on
them
but
petty
cares
had
left
no
traces
there
well
my
good
father
moreau
i
suppose
there
is
no
help
for
it
and
you
must
always
be
working
yes
benassis
there
are
one
or
two
more
bits
of
waste
that
i
mean
to
clear
for
you
before
i
knock
off
work
the
old
man
answered
cheerfully
and
light
shone
in
his
little
black
eyes
is
that
wine
that
your
wife
is
carrying
if
you
will
not
take
a
rest
now
you
ought
at
any
rate
to
take
i
take
a
rest
i
should
not
know
what
to
do
with
myself
the
sun
and
the
fresh
air
put
life
into
me
when
i
am
out
of
doors
and
busy
grubbing
up
the
land
as
to
the
wine
sir
yes
that
is
wine
sure
enough
and
it
is
all
through
your
contriving
i
know
that
the
mayor
at
courteil
lets
us
have
it
for
next
to
nothing
ah
you
managed
it
very
cleverly
but
all
the
same
i
know
you
had
a
hand
in
oh
come
come
mother
you
are
going
to
work
on
that
bit
of
land
of
champferlu
s
of
course
yes
sir
i
made
a
beginning
there
yesterday
capital
said
benassis
it
must
be
a
satisfaction
to
you
at
times
to
see
this
hillside
you
two
have
broken
up
almost
the
whole
of
the
land
on
it
lord
yes
sir
answered
the
old
woman
it
has
been
our
doing
we
have
fairly
earned
our
work
you
see
and
land
to
cultivate
are
the
poor
man
s
consols
that
good
man
would
think
himself
disgraced
if
he
went
into
the
poorhouse
or
begged
for
his
bread
he
would
choose
to
die
pickaxe
in
hand
out
in
the
open
in
the
sunlight
faith
he
bears
a
proud
heart
in
him
he
has
worked
until
work
has
become
his
very
life
and
yet
death
has
no
terrors
for
him
he
is
a
profound
philosopher
little
as
he
suspects
it
old
moreau
s
case
suggested
the
idea
to
me
of
founding
an
almshouse
for
the
country
people
of
the
district
a
refuge
for
those
who
after
working
hard
all
their
lives
have
reached
an
honorable
old
age
of
poverty
i
had
by
no
means
expected
to
make
the
fortune
which
i
have
acquired
here
indeed
i
myself
have
no
use
for
it
for
a
man
who
has
fallen
from
the
pinnacle
of
his
hopes
needs
very
little
it
costs
but
little
to
live
the
idler
s
life
alone
is
a
costly
one
and
i
am
not
sure
that
the
unproductive
consumer
is
not
robbing
the
community
at
large
there
was
some
discussion
about
napoleon
s
pension
after
his
fall
it
came
to
his
ears
and
he
said
that
five
francs
a
day
and
a
horse
to
ride
was
all
that
he
needed
i
meant
to
have
no
more
to
do
with
money
when
i
came
here
but
after
a
time
i
saw
that
money
means
power
and
that
it
is
in
fact
a
necessity
if
any
good
is
to
be
done
so
i
have
made
arrangements
in
my
will
for
turning
my
house
into
an
almshouse
in
which
old
people
who
have
not
moreau
s
fierce
independence
can
end
their
days
part
of
the
income
of
nine
thousand
francs
brought
in
by
the
mill
and
the
rest
of
my
property
will
be
devoted
to
giving
outdoor
relief
in
hard
winters
to
those
who
really
stand
in
need
of
it
this
foundation
will
be
under
the
control
of
the
municipal
council
with
the
addition
of
the
cure
who
is
to
be
president
and
in
this
way
the
money
made
in
the
district
will
be
returned
to
it
in
my
will
i
have
laid
down
the
lines
on
which
this
institution
is
to
be
conducted
it
would
be
tedious
to
go
over
them
it
is
enough
to
say
that
i
have
a
fund
which
will
some
day
enable
the
commune
to
award
several
scholarships
for
children
who
show
signs
of
promise
in
art
or
science
so
even
after
i
am
gone
my
work
of
civilization
will
continue
when
you
have
set
yourself
to
do
anything
captain
bluteau
something
within
you
urges
you
on
you
see
and
you
can
not
bear
to
leave
it
unfinished
this
craving
within
us
for
order
and
for
perfection
is
one
of
the
signs
that
point
most
surely
to
a
future
existence
now
let
us
quicken
our
pace
i
have
my
round
to
finish
and
there
are
five
or
six
more
patients
still
to
be
they
cantered
on
for
some
time
in
silence
till
benassis
said
laughingly
to
his
companion
come
now
captain
bluteau
you
have
drawn
me
out
and
made
me
chatter
like
a
magpie
and
you
have
not
said
a
syllable
about
your
own
history
which
must
be
an
interesting
one
when
a
soldier
has
come
to
your
time
of
life
he
has
seen
so
much
that
he
must
have
more
than
one
adventure
to
tell
why
my
history
has
been
simply
the
history
of
the
army
answered
genestas
soldiers
are
all
after
one
pattern
never
in
command
always
giving
and
taking
in
my
place
i
have
lived
just
like
anybody
else
i
have
been
wherever
napoleon
led
us
and
have
borne
a
part
in
every
battle
in
which
the
imperial
guard
has
struck
a
blow
but
everybody
knows
all
about
these
events
a
soldier
has
to
look
after
his
horse
to
endure
hunger
and
thirst
at
times
to
fight
whenever
there
is
fighting
to
be
done
and
there
you
have
the
whole
history
of
his
life
as
simple
as
saying
is
it
not
then
there
are
battles
in
which
your
horse
casts
a
shoe
at
the
outset
and
lands
you
in
a
quandary
and
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
that
is
the
whole
of
it
in
short
i
have
seen
so
many
countries
that
seeing
them
has
come
to
be
a
matter
of
course
and
i
have
seen
so
many
men
die
that
i
have
come
to
value
my
own
life
at
but
you
yourself
must
have
been
in
danger
at
times
and
it
would
be
interesting
to
hear
you
tell
of
your
personal
perhaps
answered
the
commandant
well
then
tell
me
about
the
adventure
that
made
the
deepest
impression
upon
you
come
do
not
hesitate
i
shall
not
think
that
you
are
wanting
in
modesty
even
if
you
should
tell
me
of
some
piece
of
heroism
on
your
part
and
when
a
man
is
quite
sure
that
he
will
not
be
misunderstood
ought
he
not
to
find
a
kind
of
pleasure
in
saying
i
did
thus
very
well
then
i
will
tell
you
about
something
that
gives
me
a
pang
of
remorse
from
time
to
time
during
fifteen
years
of
warfare
it
never
once
happened
that
i
killed
a
man
save
in
legitimate
defence
of
self
we
are
drawn
up
in
a
line
and
we
charge
and
if
we
do
not
strike
down
those
before
us
they
will
begin
to
draw
blood
without
asking
leave
so
you
have
to
kill
if
you
do
not
mean
to
be
killed
and
your
conscience
is
quite
easy
but
once
i
broke
a
comrade
s
back
it
happened
in
a
singular
way
and
it
has
been
a
painful
thing
to
me
to
think
of
afterwards
the
man
s
dying
grimace
haunts
me
at
times
but
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
it
was
during
the
retreat
from
moscow
the
commandant
went
on
the
grand
army
had
ceased
to
be
itself
we
were
more
like
a
herd
of
cattle
to
discipline
the
regiments
had
lost
sight
of
their
colors
every
one
was
his
own
master
and
the
emperor
one
need
not
scruple
to
say
it
knew
that
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
exert
his
authority
when
things
had
gone
so
far
when
we
reached
studzianka
a
little
place
on
the
other
side
of
the
beresina
we
came
upon
human
dwellings
for
the
first
time
after
several
days
there
were
barns
and
peasants
cabins
to
destroy
and
pits
full
of
potatoes
and
beetroot
the
army
had
been
without
victual
and
now
it
fairly
ran
riot
the
first
comers
as
you
might
expect
making
a
clean
sweep
of
everything
i
was
one
of
the
last
to
come
up
luckily
for
me
sleep
was
the
one
thing
that
i
longed
for
just
then
i
caught
sight
of
a
barn
and
went
into
it
i
looked
round
and
saw
a
score
of
generals
and
officers
of
high
rank
all
of
them
men
who
without
flattery
might
be
called
great
junot
was
there
and
narbonne
the
emperor
s
and
all
the
chiefs
of
the
army
there
were
common
soldiers
there
as
well
not
one
of
whom
would
have
given
up
his
bed
of
straw
to
a
marshal
of
france
some
who
were
leaning
their
backs
against
the
wall
had
dropped
off
to
sleep
where
they
stood
because
there
was
no
room
to
lie
down
others
lay
stretched
out
on
the
floor
it
was
a
mass
of
men
packed
together
so
closely
for
the
sake
of
warmth
that
i
looked
about
in
vain
for
a
nook
to
lie
down
in
i
walked
over
this
flooring
of
human
bodies
some
of
the
men
growled
the
others
said
nothing
but
no
one
budged
they
would
not
have
moved
out
of
the
way
of
a
cannon
ball
just
then
but
under
the
circumstances
one
was
not
obliged
to
practise
the
maxims
laid
down
by
the
child
s
guide
to
manners
groping
about
i
saw
at
the
end
of
the
barn
a
sort
of
ledge
up
above
in
the
roof
no
one
had
thought
of
scrambling
up
to
it
possibly
no
one
had
felt
equal
to
the
effort
i
clambered
up
and
ensconced
myself
upon
it
and
as
i
lay
there
at
full
length
i
looked
down
at
the
men
huddled
together
like
sheep
below
it
was
a
pitiful
sight
yet
it
almost
made
me
laugh
a
man
here
and
there
was
gnawing
a
frozen
carrot
with
a
kind
of
animal
satisfaction
expressed
in
his
face
and
thunderous
snores
came
from
generals
who
lay
muffled
up
in
ragged
cloaks
the
whole
barn
was
lighted
by
a
blazing
pine
log
it
might
have
set
the
place
on
fire
and
no
one
would
have
troubled
to
get
up
and
put
it
out
i
lay
down
on
my
back
and
naturally
just
before
i
dropped
off
my
eyes
traveled
to
the
roof
above
me
and
then
i
saw
that
the
main
beam
which
bore
the
weight
of
the
joists
was
being
slightly
shaken
from
east
to
west
the
blessed
thing
danced
about
in
fine
style
gentlemen
said
i
one
of
our
friends
outside
has
a
mind
to
warm
himself
at
our
a
few
moments
more
and
the
beam
was
sure
to
come
down
gentlemen
gentlemen
i
shouted
we
shall
all
be
killed
in
a
minute
look
at
the
beam
there
and
i
made
such
a
noise
that
my
awoke
at
last
well
sir
they
all
stared
up
at
the
beam
and
then
those
who
had
been
sleeping
turned
round
and
went
off
to
sleep
again
while
those
who
were
eating
did
not
even
stop
to
answer
me
seeing
how
things
were
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
get
up
and
leave
my
place
and
run
the
risk
of
finding
it
taken
by
somebody
else
for
all
the
lives
of
this
heap
of
heroes
were
at
stake
so
out
i
go
i
turn
the
corner
of
the
barn
and
come
upon
a
great
devil
of
a
wurtemberger
who
was
tugging
at
the
beam
with
a
certain
enthusiasm
aho
aho
i
shouted
trying
to
make
him
understand
that
he
must
desist
from
his
toil
mir
aus
dem
gesicht
oder
ich
schlag
dich
todt
get
out
of
my
sight
or
i
will
kill
you
he
cried
ah
yes
just
so
mire
aous
dem
i
answered
but
that
is
not
the
i
picked
up
his
gun
that
he
had
left
on
the
ground
and
broke
his
back
with
it
then
i
turned
in
again
and
went
off
to
sleep
now
you
know
the
whole
but
that
was
a
case
of
in
which
one
man
suffered
for
the
good
of
many
so
you
have
nothing
to
reproach
yourself
with
said
benassis
the
rest
of
them
thought
that
it
had
only
been
my
fancy
but
fancy
or
no
a
good
many
of
them
are
living
comfortably
in
fine
houses
without
feeling
their
hearts
oppressed
by
then
would
you
only
do
people
a
good
turn
in
order
to
receive
that
exorbitant
interest
called
gratitude
said
benassis
laughing
that
would
be
asking
a
great
deal
for
your
oh
i
know
quite
well
that
all
the
merit
of
a
good
deed
evaporates
at
once
if
it
benefits
the
doer
in
the
slightest
degree
said
genestas
if
he
tells
the
story
of
it
the
toll
brought
in
to
his
vanity
is
a
sufficient
substitute
for
gratitude
but
if
every
doer
of
kindly
actions
always
held
his
tongue
about
them
those
who
reaped
the
benefits
would
hardly
say
very
much
either
now
the
people
according
to
your
system
stand
in
need
of
examples
and
how
are
they
to
hear
of
them
amid
this
general
reticence
again
there
is
this
poor
pontooner
of
ours
who
saved
the
whole
french
army
and
who
was
never
able
to
tell
his
tale
to
any
purpose
suppose
that
he
had
lost
the
use
of
his
limbs
would
the
consciousness
of
what
he
had
done
have
found
him
in
bread
answer
me
that
philosopher
perhaps
the
rules
of
morality
can
not
be
absolute
benassis
answered
though
this
is
a
dangerous
idea
for
it
leaves
the
egoist
free
to
settle
cases
of
conscience
in
his
own
favor
listen
captain
is
not
the
man
who
never
swerves
from
the
principles
of
morality
greater
than
he
who
transgresses
them
even
through
necessity
would
not
our
veteran
dying
of
hunger
and
unable
to
help
himself
be
worthy
of
rank
with
homer
human
life
is
doubtless
a
final
trial
of
virtue
as
of
genius
for
both
of
which
a
better
world
is
waiting
virtue
and
genius
seem
to
me
to
be
the
fairest
forms
of
that
complete
and
constant
surrender
of
self
that
jesus
christ
came
among
men
to
teach
genius
sheds
its
light
in
the
world
and
lives
in
poverty
all
its
days
and
virtue
sacrifices
itself
in
silence
for
the
general
i
quite
agree
with
you
sir
said
genestas
but
those
who
dwell
on
earth
are
men
after
all
and
not
angels
we
are
not
that
is
quite
true
benassis
answered
and
as
for
errors
i
myself
have
abused
the
indulgence
but
ought
we
not
to
aim
at
any
rate
at
perfection
is
not
virtue
a
fair
ideal
which
the
soul
must
always
keep
before
it
a
standard
set
up
by
heaven
amen
said
the
soldier
an
upright
man
is
a
magnificent
thing
i
grant
you
but
on
the
other
hand
you
must
admit
that
virtue
is
a
divinity
who
may
indulge
in
a
scrap
of
gossip
now
and
then
in
the
strictest
the
doctor
smiled
but
there
was
a
melancholy
bitterness
in
his
tone
as
he
said
ah
sir
you
regard
things
with
the
lenience
natural
to
those
who
live
at
peace
with
themselves
and
i
with
all
the
severity
of
one
who
sees
much
that
he
would
fain
obliterate
in
the
story
of
his
the
two
horsemen
reached
a
cottage
beside
the
bed
of
the
torrent
the
doctor
dismounted
and
went
into
the
house
genestas
on
the
threshold
looked
over
the
bright
spring
landscape
that
lay
without
and
then
at
the
dark
interior
of
the
cottage
where
a
man
was
lying
in
bed
benassis
examined
his
patient
and
suddenly
exclaimed
my
good
woman
it
is
no
use
my
coming
here
unless
you
carry
out
my
instructions
you
have
been
giving
him
bread
you
want
to
kill
your
husband
i
suppose
botheration
if
after
this
you
give
him
anything
besides
the
tisane
of
i
will
never
set
foot
in
here
again
and
you
can
look
where
you
like
for
another
but
dear
benassis
my
old
man
was
starving
and
when
he
had
eaten
nothing
for
a
whole
fortnight
oh
yes
yes
now
will
you
listen
to
me
if
you
let
your
husband
eat
a
single
mouthful
of
bread
before
i
give
him
leave
to
take
solid
food
you
will
kill
him
do
you
hear
he
shall
not
have
anything
sir
is
he
any
better
she
asked
following
the
doctor
to
the
door
why
no
you
have
made
him
worse
by
feeding
him
shall
i
never
get
it
into
your
stupid
heads
that
you
must
not
stuff
people
who
are
being
dieted
the
peasants
are
incorrigible
benassis
went
on
speaking
to
genestas
if
a
patient
has
eaten
nothing
for
two
or
three
days
they
think
he
is
at
death
s
door
and
they
cram
him
with
soup
or
wine
or
something
here
is
a
wretched
woman
for
you
that
has
all
but
killed
her
kill
my
husband
with
a
little
mite
of
a
sop
in
wine
certainly
my
good
woman
it
amazes
me
that
he
is
still
alive
after
the
mess
you
cooked
for
him
mind
that
you
do
exactly
as
i
have
told
yes
dear
sir
i
would
far
rather
die
myself
than
lose
oh
as
to
that
i
shall
soon
see
i
shall
come
again
evening
to
bleed
let
us
walk
along
the
side
of
the
stream
benassis
said
to
genestas
there
is
only
a
footpath
between
this
cottage
and
the
next
house
where
i
must
pay
a
call
that
man
s
little
boy
will
hold
our
you
must
admire
this
lovely
valley
of
ours
a
little
he
went
on
it
is
like
an
english
garden
is
it
not
the
laborer
who
lives
in
the
cottage
which
we
are
going
to
visit
has
never
got
over
the
death
of
one
of
his
children
the
eldest
boy
he
was
only
a
lad
would
try
to
do
a
man
s
work
last
it
was
beyond
his
strength
and
before
the
autumn
was
out
he
died
of
a
decline
this
is
the
first
case
of
really
strong
fatherly
love
that
has
come
under
my
notice
as
a
rule
when
their
children
die
the
peasant
s
regret
is
for
the
loss
of
a
useful
chattel
and
a
part
of
their
and
the
older
the
child
the
heavier
their
sense
of
loss
a
son
or
daughter
is
so
much
capital
to
the
parents
but
this
poor
fellow
really
loved
that
boy
of
his
nothing
cam
comfort
me
for
my
loss
he
said
one
day
when
i
came
across
him
out
in
the
fields
he
had
forgotten
all
about
his
work
and
was
standing
there
motionless
leaning
on
his
scythe
he
had
picked
up
his
hone
it
lay
in
his
hand
and
he
had
forgotten
to
use
it
he
has
never
spoken
since
of
his
grief
to
me
but
he
has
grown
sad
and
silent
just
now
it
is
one
of
his
little
girls
who
is
benassis
and
his
guest
reached
the
little
house
as
they
talked
it
stood
beside
a
pathway
that
led
to
a
they
saw
a
man
about
forty
years
of
age
standing
under
a
willow
tree
eating
bread
that
had
been
rubbed
with
a
clove
of
garlic
well
gasnier
is
the
little
one
doing
better
i
do
not
know
sir
he
said
dejectedly
you
will
see
my
wife
is
sitting
with
her
in
spite
of
all
your
care
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
death
will
come
to
empty
my
home
for
do
not
lose
heart
gasnier
death
is
too
busy
to
take
up
his
abode
in
any
benassis
went
into
the
house
followed
by
the
father
half
an
hour
later
he
came
out
again
the
mother
was
with
him
this
time
and
he
spoke
to
her
you
need
have
no
anxiety
about
her
now
follow
out
my
instructions
she
is
out
of
if
you
are
growing
tired
of
this
sort
of
thing
the
doctor
said
to
the
officer
as
he
mounted
his
horse
i
can
put
you
on
the
way
to
the
town
and
you
can
no
i
am
not
tired
of
it
i
give
you
my
but
you
will
only
see
cottages
everywhere
and
they
are
all
alike
nothing
to
outward
seeming
is
more
monotonous
than
the
let
us
go
on
said
the
officer
they
rode
on
in
this
way
for
several
hours
and
after
going
from
one
side
of
the
canton
to
the
other
they
returned
towards
evening
to
the
precincts
of
the
town
i
must
just
go
over
there
the
doctor
said
to
genestas
as
he
pointed
out
a
place
where
a
cluster
of
grew
those
trees
may
possibly
be
two
hundred
years
old
he
went
on
and
that
is
where
the
woman
lives
on
whose
account
the
lad
came
to
fetch
me
last
night
at
dinner
with
a
message
that
she
had
turned
quite
was
it
anything
serious
no
said
benassis
an
effect
of
pregnancy
it
is
the
last
month
with
her
a
time
at
which
some
women
suffer
from
spasms
but
by
way
of
precaution
i
must
go
in
any
case
to
make
sure
that
there
are
no
further
alarming
symptoms
i
shall
see
her
through
her
confinement
myself
and
moreover
i
should
like
to
show
you
one
of
our
new
industries
there
is
a
here
it
is
a
good
road
shall
we
gallop
will
your
animal
keep
up
with
mine
asked
genestas
heigh
neptune
he
called
to
his
horse
and
in
a
moment
the
officer
had
been
carried
far
ahead
and
was
lost
to
sight
in
a
cloud
of
dust
but
in
spite
of
the
paces
of
his
horse
he
still
heard
the
doctor
beside
him
at
a
word
from
benassis
his
own
horse
left
the
commandant
so
far
behind
that
the
latter
only
came
up
with
him
at
the
gate
of
the
where
the
doctor
was
quietly
fastening
the
bridle
to
the
the
devil
take
it
cried
genestas
after
a
look
at
the
horse
that
was
neither
sweated
nor
blown
what
kind
of
animal
have
you
there
ah
said
the
doctor
you
took
him
for
a
screw
the
history
of
this
fine
fellow
would
take
up
too
much
time
just
now
let
it
suffice
to
say
that
roustan
is
a
thoroughbred
barb
from
the
atlas
mountains
and
a
barbary
horse
is
as
good
as
an
arab
this
one
of
mine
will
gallop
up
the
mountain
roads
without
turning
a
hair
and
will
never
miss
his
footing
in
a
canter
along
the
brink
of
a
precipice
he
was
a
present
to
me
and
i
think
that
i
deserved
it
for
in
this
way
a
father
sought
to
repay
me
for
his
daughter
s
life
she
is
one
of
the
wealthiest
heiresses
in
europe
and
she
was
at
the
brink
of
death
when
i
found
her
on
the
road
to
savoy
if
i
were
to
tell
you
how
i
cured
that
young
lady
you
would
take
me
for
a
quack
aha
that
is
the
sound
of
the
bells
on
the
horses
and
the
rumbling
of
a
wagon
it
is
coming
along
this
way
let
us
see
perhaps
that
is
vigneau
himself
and
if
so
take
a
good
look
at
him
in
another
moment
the
officer
saw
a
team
of
four
huge
horses
like
those
which
are
owned
by
prosperous
farmers
in
brie
the
harness
the
little
bells
and
the
knots
of
braid
in
their
manes
were
clean
and
smart
the
great
wagon
itself
was
painted
bright
blue
and
perched
aloft
in
it
sat
a
stalwart
sunburned
youth
who
shouldered
his
whip
like
a
gun
and
whistled
a
tune
no
said
benassis
that
is
only
the
wagoner
but
see
how
the
master
s
prosperity
in
business
is
reflected
by
all
his
belongings
even
by
the
carter
s
wagon
is
it
not
a
sign
of
a
capacity
for
business
not
very
often
met
with
in
remote
country
places
yes
yes
it
all
looks
very
smart
indeed
the
officer
answered
well
vigneau
has
two
more
wagons
and
teams
like
that
one
and
he
has
a
small
pony
besides
for
business
purposes
for
he
does
trade
over
a
wide
area
and
only
four
years
ago
he
had
nothing
in
the
world
stay
that
is
a
mistake
he
had
some
debts
but
let
us
go
is
mme
vigneau
in
the
house
benassis
asked
of
the
young
wagoner
she
is
out
in
the
garden
sir
i
saw
her
just
now
by
the
hedge
down
yonder
i
will
go
and
tell
her
that
you
are
genestas
followed
benassis
across
a
wide
open
space
with
a
hedge
about
it
in
one
corner
various
heaps
of
clay
had
been
piled
up
destined
for
tiles
and
pantiles
and
a
stack
of
brushwood
and
logs
fuel
for
the
kiln
no
doubt
lay
in
another
part
of
the
enclosure
farther
away
some
workmen
were
pounding
chalk
stones
and
tempering
the
clay
in
a
space
enclosed
by
hurdles
the
tiles
both
round
and
square
were
made
under
the
great
elms
opposite
the
gateway
in
a
vast
green
arbor
bounded
by
the
roofs
of
the
and
near
this
last
the
yawning
mouth
of
the
kiln
was
visible
some
shovels
lay
about
the
worn
cider
path
a
second
row
of
buildings
had
been
erected
parallel
with
these
there
was
a
sufficiently
wretched
dwelling
which
housed
the
family
and
some
outbuildings
sheds
and
stables
and
a
barn
the
cleanliness
that
predominated
throughout
and
the
thorough
repair
in
which
everything
was
kept
spoke
well
for
the
vigilance
of
the
master
s
eyes
some
poultry
and
pigs
wandered
at
large
over
the
field
vigneau
s
predecessor
said
benassis
was
a
a
lazy
rascal
who
cared
about
nothing
by
drink
he
had
been
a
workman
himself
he
could
keep
a
fire
in
his
kiln
and
could
put
a
price
on
his
work
and
that
was
about
all
he
knew
he
had
no
energy
and
no
idea
of
business
if
no
one
came
to
buy
his
wares
of
him
they
simply
stayed
on
hand
and
were
spoiled
and
so
he
lost
the
value
of
them
so
he
died
of
want
at
last
he
had
his
wife
till
she
was
almost
idiotic
and
she
lived
in
a
state
of
abject
wretchedness
it
was
so
painful
to
see
this
laziness
and
incurable
stupidity
and
i
so
much
disliked
the
sight
of
the
that
i
never
came
this
way
if
i
could
help
it
luckily
both
the
man
and
his
wife
were
old
people
one
fine
day
the
had
a
paralytic
stroke
and
i
had
him
removed
to
the
hospital
at
grenoble
at
once
the
owner
of
the
agreed
to
take
it
over
without
disputing
about
its
condition
and
i
looked
round
for
new
tenants
who
would
take
their
part
in
improving
the
industries
of
the
canton
mme
gravier
s
had
married
a
poor
workman
who
was
earning
so
little
with
the
potter
who
employed
him
that
he
could
not
support
his
household
he
listened
to
my
advice
and
actually
had
sufficient
courage
to
take
a
lease
of
our
when
he
had
not
so
much
as
a
penny
he
came
and
took
up
his
abode
here
taught
his
wife
her
aged
mother
and
his
own
mother
how
to
make
tiles
and
made
workmen
of
them
how
they
managed
i
do
not
know
upon
my
honor
vigneau
probably
borrowed
fuel
to
heat
his
kiln
he
certainly
worked
by
day
and
fetched
in
his
materials
in
by
night
in
short
no
one
knew
what
boundless
energy
he
brought
to
bear
upon
his
enterprise
and
the
two
old
mothers
clad
in
rags
worked
like
negroes
in
this
way
vigneau
contrived
to
fire
several
batches
and
lived
for
the
first
year
on
bread
that
was
hardly
won
by
the
toil
of
his
household
still
he
made
a
living
his
courage
patience
and
sterling
worth
interested
many
people
in
him
and
he
began
to
be
known
he
was
indefatigable
he
would
hurry
over
to
grenoble
in
the
morning
and
sell
his
bricks
and
tiles
there
then
he
would
return
home
about
the
middle
of
the
day
and
go
back
again
to
the
town
at
night
he
seemed
to
be
in
several
places
at
once
towards
the
end
of
the
first
year
he
took
two
little
lads
to
help
him
seeing
how
things
were
i
lent
him
some
money
and
since
then
from
year
to
year
the
fortunes
of
the
family
have
steadily
improved
after
the
second
year
was
over
the
two
old
mothers
no
longer
moulded
bricks
nor
pounded
stones
they
looked
after
the
little
gardens
made
the
soup
mended
the
clothes
they
did
spinning
in
the
evenings
and
gathered
firewood
in
the
daytime
while
the
young
wife
who
can
read
and
write
kept
the
accounts
vigneau
had
a
small
horse
and
rode
on
his
business
errands
about
the
neighborhood
next
he
thoroughly
studied
the
art
of
brick
and
tile
making
discovering
how
to
make
excellent
square
white
and
sold
them
for
less
than
the
usual
prices
in
the
third
year
he
had
a
cart
and
a
pair
of
horses
and
at
the
same
time
his
wife
s
appearance
became
almost
elegant
everything
about
his
household
improved
with
the
improvement
in
his
business
and
everywhere
there
was
the
same
neatness
method
and
thrift
that
had
been
the
making
of
his
little
fortune
at
last
he
had
work
enough
for
six
men
to
whom
he
pays
good
wages
he
employs
a
wagoner
and
everything
about
him
wears
an
air
of
prosperity
little
by
little
in
short
by
dint
of
taking
pains
and
extending
his
business
his
income
has
increased
he
bought
the
last
year
and
next
year
he
will
rebuild
his
house
all
the
worthy
folk
there
are
well
clothed
and
in
good
health
his
wife
who
used
to
be
so
thin
and
pale
when
the
burden
of
her
husband
s
cares
and
anxieties
used
to
press
so
hardly
upon
her
has
recovered
her
good
looks
and
has
grown
quite
young
and
pretty
again
the
two
old
mothers
are
thoroughly
happy
and
take
the
deepest
interest
in
every
detail
of
the
housekeeping
or
of
the
business
work
has
brought
money
and
the
money
that
brought
freedom
from
care
brought
health
and
plenty
and
happiness
the
story
of
this
household
is
a
living
history
in
miniature
of
the
commune
since
i
have
known
it
and
of
all
young
industrial
states
the
tile
factory
that
used
to
look
so
empty
melancholy
and
useless
is
now
in
full
work
astir
with
life
and
well
stocked
with
everything
required
there
is
a
good
stock
of
wood
here
and
all
the
raw
material
for
the
season
s
work
for
as
you
know
tiles
can
only
be
made
during
a
few
months
in
the
year
between
june
and
september
is
it
not
a
pleasure
to
see
all
this
activity
my
has
done
his
share
of
the
work
in
every
building
going
always
busy
the
devourer
they
call
him
in
these
benassis
had
scarcely
finished
speaking
when
the
wicket
gate
which
gave
entrance
to
the
garden
opened
and
a
young
woman
appeared
she
came
forward
as
quickly
as
her
condition
allowed
though
the
two
horsemen
hastened
towards
her
her
attire
somewhat
recalled
her
former
quality
of
ladies
maid
for
she
wore
a
pretty
cap
a
pink
dress
a
silk
apron
and
white
stockings
mme
vigneau
in
short
was
a
woman
sufficiently
plump
and
if
she
was
somewhat
sunburned
her
natural
complexion
must
have
been
very
fair
there
were
a
few
lines
still
left
on
her
forehead
traced
there
by
the
troubles
of
past
days
but
she
had
a
bright
and
winsome
face
she
spoke
in
a
persuasive
voice
as
she
saw
that
the
doctor
came
no
further
will
you
not
do
me
the
honor
of
coming
inside
and
resting
for
a
moment
benassis
certainly
we
will
come
this
way
the
gentleman
must
be
very
hot
will
you
take
a
little
milk
or
some
wine
benassis
please
try
a
little
of
the
wine
that
my
husband
has
been
so
kind
as
to
buy
for
my
confinement
you
will
tell
me
if
it
is
you
have
a
good
man
for
your
yes
sir
she
turned
and
spoke
in
quiet
tones
i
am
very
well
we
will
not
take
anything
mme
vigneau
i
only
came
round
this
way
to
see
that
nothing
troublesome
had
nothing
she
said
i
was
busy
out
in
the
garden
as
you
saw
turning
the
soil
over
for
the
sake
of
something
to
then
the
two
old
mothers
came
out
to
speak
to
benassis
and
the
young
wagoner
planted
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
in
a
spot
from
whence
he
could
have
a
good
view
of
the
doctor
let
us
see
let
me
have
your
hand
said
benassis
addressing
mme
vigneau
and
as
he
carefully
felt
her
pulse
he
stood
in
silence
absorbed
in
thought
the
three
women
meanwhile
scrutinized
the
commandant
with
the
undisguised
curiosity
that
country
people
do
not
scruple
to
express
nothing
could
be
better
cried
the
doctor
cheerily
will
she
be
confined
soon
both
the
mothers
asked
together
this
week
beyond
a
doubt
is
vigneau
away
from
home
he
asked
after
a
pause
yes
sir
the
young
wife
answered
he
is
hurrying
about
settling
his
business
affairs
so
as
to
be
able
to
stay
at
home
during
my
confinement
the
dear
man
well
my
children
go
on
and
prosper
continue
to
increase
your
wealth
and
to
add
to
your
the
cleanliness
of
the
almost
ruinous
dwelling
filled
genestas
with
admiration
benassis
saw
the
officer
s
astonishment
and
said
there
is
no
one
like
mme
vigneau
for
keeping
a
house
clean
and
tidy
like
this
i
wish
that
several
people
in
the
town
would
come
here
to
take
a
the
s
wife
blushed
and
turned
her
head
away
but
the
faces
of
the
two
old
mothers
beamed
with
pleasure
at
the
doctor
s
words
and
the
three
women
walked
with
them
to
the
spot
where
the
horses
were
waiting
well
now
the
doctor
said
to
the
two
old
women
here
is
happiness
for
you
both
were
you
not
longing
to
be
grandmothers
oh
do
not
talk
about
it
said
the
young
wife
they
will
drive
me
crazy
among
them
my
two
mothers
wish
for
a
boy
and
my
husband
would
like
to
have
a
little
girl
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
please
them
all
i
but
you
yourself
asked
benassis
what
is
your
wish
ah
sir
i
wish
for
a
child
of
my
there
she
is
a
mother
already
you
see
said
the
doctor
to
the
officer
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
bridle
of
his
horse
benassis
my
husband
will
be
sadly
disappointed
to
learn
that
you
have
been
here
when
he
was
not
at
home
to
see
he
has
not
forgotten
to
send
the
thousand
tiles
to
the
for
me
you
know
quite
well
sir
that
he
would
keep
all
the
orders
in
the
canton
waiting
to
serve
you
why
taking
your
money
is
the
thing
that
troubles
him
most
but
i
always
tell
him
that
your
crowns
bring
luck
with
them
and
so
they
said
benassis
a
little
group
gathered
about
the
bars
across
the
entrance
to
the
the
three
women
the
young
wagoner
and
two
workmen
who
had
left
off
work
to
greet
the
doctor
lingered
there
to
have
the
pleasure
of
being
with
him
until
the
last
moment
as
we
are
wont
to
linger
with
those
we
love
the
promptings
of
men
s
hearts
must
everywhere
be
the
same
and
in
every
land
friendship
expresses
itself
in
the
same
gracious
ways
benassis
looked
at
the
height
of
the
sun
and
spoke
to
his
companion
there
are
still
two
hours
of
daylight
left
and
if
you
are
not
too
hungry
we
will
go
to
see
some
one
with
whom
i
nearly
always
spend
the
interval
between
the
last
of
my
visits
and
the
hour
for
dinner
she
is
a
charming
girl
whom
every
one
here
calls
my
good
that
is
the
name
that
they
usually
give
to
an
affianced
bride
but
you
must
not
imagine
that
there
is
the
slightest
imputation
of
any
kind
implied
or
intended
by
the
use
of
the
word
in
this
case
poor
child
the
care
that
i
have
taken
of
her
has
as
may
be
imagined
made
her
an
object
of
jealousy
but
the
general
opinion
entertained
as
to
my
character
has
prevented
any
spiteful
gossip
if
no
one
understands
the
apparent
caprice
that
has
led
me
to
make
an
allowance
to
la
fosseuse
so
that
she
can
live
without
being
compelled
to
work
nobody
has
any
doubts
as
to
her
character
i
have
watched
over
her
with
friendly
care
and
every
one
knows
that
i
should
never
hesitate
to
marry
her
if
my
affection
for
her
exceeded
the
limits
of
friendship
but
no
woman
exists
for
me
here
in
the
canton
or
anywhere
else
said
the
doctor
forcing
a
smile
some
natures
feel
a
tyrannous
need
to
attach
themselves
to
some
one
thing
or
being
which
they
single
out
from
among
the
beings
and
things
around
them
this
need
is
felt
most
keenly
by
a
man
of
quick
sympathies
and
all
the
more
pressingly
if
his
life
has
been
made
desolate
so
trust
me
it
is
a
favorable
sign
if
a
man
is
strongly
attached
to
his
dog
or
his
horse
among
the
suffering
flock
which
chance
has
given
into
my
care
this
poor
little
sufferer
has
come
to
be
for
me
like
the
pet
lamb
that
the
shepherd
lasses
deck
with
ribbons
in
my
own
sunny
land
of
languedoc
they
talk
to
it
and
allow
it
to
find
pasture
by
the
side
of
the
cornfields
and
its
leisurely
pace
is
never
hurried
by
the
shepherd
s
benassis
stood
with
his
hand
on
his
horse
s
mane
as
he
spoke
ready
to
spring
into
the
saddle
but
making
no
effort
to
do
so
as
though
the
thoughts
that
stirred
in
him
were
but
little
in
keeping
with
rapid
movements
let
us
go
he
said
at
last
come
with
me
and
pay
her
a
visit
i
am
taking
you
to
see
her
does
not
that
tell
you
that
i
treat
her
as
a
sister
as
they
rode
on
their
way
again
genestas
said
to
the
doctor
will
you
regard
it
as
inquisitiveness
on
my
part
if
i
ask
to
hear
more
of
la
fosseuse
i
have
come
to
know
the
story
of
many
lives
through
you
and
hers
can
not
be
less
interesting
than
some
of
benassis
stopped
his
horse
as
he
answered
perhaps
you
will
not
share
in
the
feelings
of
interest
awakened
in
me
by
la
fosseuse
her
fate
is
like
my
own
we
have
both
alike
missed
our
vocation
it
is
the
similarity
of
our
lots
that
occasions
my
sympathy
for
her
and
the
feelings
that
i
experience
at
the
sight
of
her
you
either
followed
your
natural
bent
when
you
entered
upon
a
military
career
or
you
took
a
liking
for
your
calling
after
you
had
adopted
it
otherwise
you
would
not
have
borne
the
heavy
yoke
of
military
discipline
till
now
you
therefore
can
not
understand
the
sorrows
of
a
soul
that
must
always
feel
renewed
within
it
the
stir
of
longings
that
can
never
be
realized
nor
the
pining
existence
of
a
creature
forced
to
live
in
an
alien
sphere
such
sufferings
as
these
are
known
only
to
these
natures
and
to
god
who
sends
their
afflictions
for
they
alone
can
know
how
deeply
the
events
of
life
affect
them
you
yourself
have
seen
the
miseries
produced
by
long
wars
till
they
have
almost
ceased
to
impress
you
but
have
you
never
detected
a
trace
of
sadness
in
your
mind
at
the
sight
of
a
tree
bearing
sere
leaves
in
the
midst
of
spring
some
tree
that
is
pining
and
dying
because
it
has
been
planted
in
soil
in
which
it
could
not
find
the
sustenance
required
for
its
full
development
ever
since
my
twentieth
year
there
has
been
something
painful
and
melancholy
for
me
about
the
drooping
of
a
stunted
plant
and
now
i
can
not
bear
the
sight
and
turn
my
head
away
my
youthful
sorrow
was
a
vague
presentiment
of
the
sorrows
of
my
later
life
it
was
a
kind
of
sympathy
between
my
present
and
a
future
dimly
foreshadowed
by
the
life
of
the
tree
that
before
its
time
was
going
the
way
of
all
trees
and
i
thought
that
you
had
suffered
when
i
saw
how
kind
you
you
see
sir
the
doctor
went
on
without
any
reply
to
the
remark
made
by
genestas
that
to
speak
of
la
fosseuse
is
to
speak
of
myself
la
fosseuse
is
a
plant
in
an
alien
soil
a
human
plant
moreover
consumed
by
sad
thoughts
that
have
their
source
in
the
depths
of
her
nature
and
that
never
cease
to
multiply
the
poor
girl
is
never
well
and
strong
the
soul
within
her
kills
the
body
this
fragile
creature
was
suffering
from
the
sorest
of
all
troubles
a
trouble
which
receives
the
least
possible
sympathy
from
our
selfish
world
and
how
could
i
look
on
with
indifferent
eyes
for
i
a
man
strong
to
wrestle
with
pain
was
nightly
tempted
to
refuse
to
bear
the
burden
of
a
sorrow
like
hers
perhaps
i
might
actually
have
refused
to
bear
it
but
for
a
thought
of
religion
which
soothes
my
impatience
and
fills
my
heart
with
sweet
illusions
even
if
we
were
not
children
of
the
same
father
in
heaven
la
fosseuse
would
still
be
my
sister
in
suffering
benassis
pressed
his
knees
against
his
horse
s
sides
and
swept
ahead
of
commandant
genestas
as
if
he
shrank
from
continuing
this
conversation
any
further
when
their
horses
were
once
more
cantering
abreast
of
each
other
he
spoke
again
nature
has
created
this
poor
girl
for
sorrow
he
said
as
she
has
created
other
women
for
joy
it
is
impossible
to
do
otherwise
than
believe
in
a
future
life
at
the
sight
of
natures
thus
predestined
to
suffer
la
fosseuse
is
sensitive
and
highly
strung
if
the
weather
is
dark
and
cloudy
she
is
depressed
she
weeps
when
the
sky
is
weeping
a
phrase
of
her
own
she
sings
with
the
birds
she
grows
happy
and
serene
under
a
cloudless
sky
the
loveliness
of
a
bright
day
passes
into
her
face
a
soft
sweet
perfume
is
an
inexhaustible
pleasure
to
her
i
have
seen
her
take
delight
the
whole
day
long
in
the
scent
breathed
forth
by
some
mignonette
and
after
one
of
those
rainy
mornings
that
bring
out
all
the
soul
of
the
flowers
and
give
indescribable
freshness
and
brightness
to
the
day
she
seems
to
overflow
with
gladness
like
the
green
world
around
her
if
it
is
close
and
hot
and
there
is
thunder
in
the
air
la
fosseuse
feels
a
vague
trouble
that
nothing
can
soothe
she
lies
on
her
bed
complains
of
numberless
different
ills
and
does
not
know
what
ails
her
in
answer
to
my
questions
she
tells
me
that
her
bones
are
melting
that
she
is
dissolving
into
water
her
heart
has
left
her
to
quote
another
of
her
sayings
i
have
sometimes
come
upon
the
poor
child
suddenly
and
found
her
in
tears
as
she
gazed
at
the
sunset
effects
we
sometimes
see
here
among
our
mountains
when
bright
masses
of
cloud
gather
and
crowd
together
and
pile
themselves
above
the
golden
peaks
of
the
hills
why
are
you
crying
little
one
i
have
asked
her
i
do
not
know
sir
has
been
the
answer
i
have
grown
so
stupid
with
looking
up
there
i
have
looked
and
looked
till
i
hardly
know
where
i
but
what
do
you
see
there
i
can
not
tell
you
sir
and
you
might
question
her
in
this
way
all
the
evening
yet
you
would
never
draw
a
word
from
her
but
she
would
look
at
you
and
every
glance
would
seem
full
of
thoughts
or
she
would
sit
with
tears
in
her
eyes
scarcely
saying
a
word
apparently
rapt
in
musing
those
musings
of
hers
are
so
profound
that
you
fall
under
the
spell
of
them
on
me
at
least
she
has
the
effect
of
a
cloud
overcharged
with
electricity
one
day
i
plied
her
with
questions
i
tried
with
all
my
might
to
make
her
talk
at
last
i
let
fall
a
few
rather
hasty
words
and
well
she
burst
into
tears
at
other
times
la
fosseuse
is
bright
and
winning
active
merry
and
sprightly
she
enjoys
talking
and
the
ideas
which
she
expresses
are
fresh
and
original
she
is
however
quite
unable
to
apply
herself
steadily
to
any
kind
of
work
when
she
was
out
in
the
fields
she
used
to
spend
whole
hours
in
looking
at
a
flower
in
watching
the
water
flow
in
gazing
at
the
wonders
in
the
depths
of
the
clear
still
river
pools
at
the
picturesque
mosaic
made
up
of
pebbles
and
earth
and
sand
of
water
plants
and
green
moss
and
the
brown
soil
washed
down
by
the
stream
a
deposit
full
of
soft
shades
of
color
and
of
hues
that
contrast
strangely
with
each
other
when
i
first
came
to
the
district
the
poor
girl
was
starving
it
hurt
her
pride
to
accept
the
bread
of
others
and
it
was
only
when
driven
to
the
last
extremity
of
want
and
suffering
that
she
could
bring
herself
to
ask
for
charity
the
feeling
that
this
was
a
disgrace
would
often
give
her
energy
and
for
several
days
she
worked
in
the
fields
but
her
strength
was
soon
exhausted
and
illness
obliged
her
to
leave
the
work
that
she
had
begun
she
had
scarcely
recovered
when
she
went
to
a
farm
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
asked
to
be
taken
on
to
look
after
the
cattle
she
did
her
work
well
and
intelligently
but
after
a
while
she
left
without
giving
any
reason
for
so
doing
the
constant
toil
day
after
day
was
no
doubt
too
heavy
a
yoke
for
one
who
is
all
independence
and
caprice
then
she
set
herself
to
look
for
mushrooms
or
for
truffles
going
over
to
grenoble
to
sell
them
but
the
gaudy
trifles
in
the
town
were
very
tempting
the
few
small
coins
in
her
hand
seemed
to
be
great
riches
she
would
forget
her
poverty
and
buy
ribbons
and
finery
without
a
thought
for
tomorrow
s
bread
but
if
some
other
girl
here
in
the
town
took
a
fancy
to
her
brass
crucifix
her
agate
heart
or
her
velvet
ribbon
she
would
make
them
over
to
her
at
once
glad
to
give
happiness
for
she
lives
by
generous
impulses
so
la
fosseuse
was
loved
and
pitied
and
despised
by
turns
everything
in
her
nature
was
a
cause
of
suffering
to
her
her
indolence
her
kindness
of
heart
her
coquetry
for
she
is
coquettish
dainty
and
inquisitive
in
short
she
is
a
woman
she
is
as
simple
as
a
child
and
like
a
child
she
is
carried
away
by
her
tastes
and
her
impressions
if
you
tell
her
about
some
noble
deed
she
trembles
her
color
rises
her
heart
throbs
fast
and
she
sheds
tears
of
joy
if
you
begin
a
story
about
robbers
she
turns
pale
with
terror
you
could
not
find
a
more
sincere
and
scrupulously
loyal
nature
anywhere
if
you
were
to
give
a
hundred
gold
pieces
into
her
keeping
she
would
bury
them
in
some
nook
and
beg
her
bread
as
there
was
a
change
in
benassis
tone
as
he
uttered
these
last
words
i
once
determined
to
put
her
to
the
proof
he
said
and
i
repented
of
it
it
is
like
espionage
to
bring
a
test
to
bear
upon
another
is
it
not
it
means
that
we
suspect
them
at
any
here
the
doctor
paused
as
though
some
inward
reflection
engrossed
him
he
was
quite
unconscious
of
the
embarrassment
that
his
last
remark
had
caused
to
his
companion
who
busied
himself
with
disentangling
the
reins
in
order
to
hide
his
confusion
benassis
soon
resumed
his
talk
i
should
like
to
find
a
husband
for
my
fosseuse
i
should
be
glad
to
make
over
one
of
my
farms
to
some
good
fellow
who
would
make
her
happy
and
she
would
be
happy
the
poor
girl
would
love
her
children
to
distraction
for
motherhood
which
develops
the
whole
of
a
woman
s
nature
would
give
full
scope
to
her
overflowing
sentiments
she
has
never
cared
for
any
one
however
yet
her
impressionable
nature
is
a
danger
to
her
she
knows
this
herself
and
when
she
saw
that
i
recognized
it
she
admitted
the
excitability
of
her
temperament
to
me
she
belongs
to
the
small
minority
of
women
whom
the
slightest
contact
with
others
causes
to
vibrate
perilously
so
that
she
must
be
made
to
value
herself
on
her
discretion
and
her
womanly
pride
she
is
as
wild
and
shy
as
a
swallow
ah
what
a
wealth
of
kindness
there
is
in
her
nature
meant
her
to
be
a
rich
woman
she
would
be
so
beneficent
for
a
woman
she
would
be
so
faithful
and
true
she
is
only
years
old
and
is
sinking
already
beneath
the
weight
of
her
soul
a
victim
to
nerves
to
an
organization
either
too
delicate
or
too
full
of
power
a
passionate
love
for
a
faithless
lover
would
drive
her
mad
my
poor
fosseuse
i
have
made
a
study
of
her
temperament
recognized
the
reality
of
her
prolonged
nervous
attacks
and
of
the
swift
mysterious
recurrence
of
her
uplifted
moods
i
found
that
they
were
immediately
dependent
on
atmospheric
changes
and
on
the
variations
of
the
moon
a
fact
which
i
have
carefully
verified
and
since
then
i
have
cared
for
her
as
a
creature
unlike
all
others
for
she
is
a
being
whose
ailing
existence
i
alone
can
understand
as
i
have
told
you
she
is
the
pet
lamb
but
you
shall
see
her
this
is
her
they
had
come
about
of
the
way
up
the
mountain
side
low
bushes
grew
on
either
hand
along
the
steep
paths
which
they
were
ascending
at
a
foot
pace
at
last
at
a
turn
in
one
of
the
paths
genestas
saw
la
fosseuse
s
dwelling
which
stood
on
one
of
the
largest
knolls
on
the
mountain
around
it
was
a
green
sloping
space
of
lawn
about
three
acres
in
extent
planted
with
trees
and
surrounded
by
a
wall
high
enough
to
serve
as
a
fence
but
not
so
high
as
to
shut
out
the
view
of
the
landscape
several
rivulets
that
had
their
source
in
this
garden
formed
little
cascades
among
the
trees
the
cottage
with
a
low
roof
that
projected
several
feet
was
a
charming
detail
in
the
landscape
it
consisted
of
a
ground
floor
and
a
single
story
and
stood
facing
the
south
all
the
windows
were
in
the
front
of
the
house
for
its
small
size
and
lack
of
depth
from
back
to
front
made
other
openings
unnecessary
the
doors
and
shutters
were
painted
green
and
the
underside
of
the
penthouses
had
been
lined
with
deal
boards
in
the
german
fashion
and
painted
white
the
rustic
charm
of
the
whole
little
dwelling
lay
in
its
spotless
cleanliness
climbing
plants
and
briar
roses
grew
about
the
house
a
great
walnut
tree
had
been
allowed
to
remain
among
the
flowering
acacias
and
trees
that
bore
blossoms
and
a
few
weeping
willows
had
been
set
by
the
little
streams
in
the
garden
space
a
thick
belt
of
pines
and
beeches
grew
behind
the
house
so
that
the
picturesque
little
dwelling
was
brought
out
into
strong
relief
by
the
sombre
width
of
background
at
that
hour
of
the
day
the
air
was
fragrant
with
the
scents
from
the
hillsides
and
the
perfume
from
la
fosseuse
s
garden
the
sky
overhead
was
clear
and
serene
but
low
clouds
hung
on
the
horizon
and
the
peaks
had
begun
to
take
the
deep
rose
hues
that
the
sunset
often
brings
at
the
height
which
they
had
reached
the
whole
valley
lay
before
their
eyes
from
distant
grenoble
to
the
little
lake
at
the
foot
of
the
circle
of
crags
by
which
genestas
had
passed
on
the
previous
day
some
little
distance
above
the
house
a
line
of
poplars
on
the
hill
indicated
the
highway
that
led
to
grenoble
rays
of
sunlight
fell
slantwise
across
the
little
town
which
glittered
like
a
diamond
for
the
soft
red
light
which
poured
over
it
like
a
flood
was
reflected
by
all
its
genestas
reined
in
his
horse
at
the
sight
and
pointed
to
the
dwellings
in
the
valley
to
the
new
town
and
to
la
fosseuse
s
house
since
the
victory
of
wagram
and
napoleon
s
return
to
the
tuileries
in
he
said
with
a
sigh
nothing
has
so
stirred
me
as
the
sight
of
all
this
i
owe
this
pleasure
to
you
sir
for
you
have
taught
me
to
see
beauty
in
a
yes
said
the
doctor
smiling
as
he
spoke
it
is
better
to
build
towns
than
to
storm
oh
sir
how
about
the
taking
of
moscow
and
the
surrender
of
mantua
why
you
do
not
really
know
what
that
means
is
it
not
a
glory
for
all
of
us
you
are
a
good
man
but
napoleon
also
was
a
good
man
if
it
had
not
been
for
england
you
both
would
have
understood
each
other
and
our
emperor
would
never
have
fallen
there
are
no
spies
here
said
the
officer
looking
around
him
and
i
can
say
openly
that
i
love
him
now
that
he
is
dead
what
a
ruler
he
knew
every
man
when
he
saw
him
he
would
have
made
you
a
councillor
of
state
for
he
was
a
great
administrator
himself
even
to
the
point
of
knowing
how
many
cartridges
were
left
in
the
men
s
boxes
after
an
action
poor
man
while
you
were
talking
about
la
fosseuse
i
thought
of
him
and
how
he
was
lying
dead
in
helena
was
that
the
kind
of
climate
and
country
to
suit
whose
seat
had
been
a
throne
and
who
had
lived
with
his
feet
in
the
stirrups
hein
they
say
that
he
used
to
work
in
the
garden
the
deuce
he
was
not
made
to
plant
cabbages
and
now
we
must
serve
the
bourbons
and
loyally
sir
for
after
all
france
is
france
as
you
were
saying
genestas
dismounted
as
he
uttered
these
last
words
and
mechanically
followed
the
example
set
by
benassis
who
fastened
his
horse
s
bridle
to
a
tree
can
she
be
away
said
the
doctor
when
he
did
not
see
la
fosseuse
on
the
threshold
they
went
into
the
house
but
there
was
no
one
in
the
sitting
room
on
the
ground
floor
she
must
have
heard
the
sound
of
a
second
horse
said
benassis
with
a
smile
and
has
gone
upstairs
to
put
on
her
cap
or
her
sash
or
some
piece
of
he
left
genestas
alone
and
went
upstairs
in
search
of
la
fosseuse
the
commandant
made
a
survey
of
the
room
he
noticed
the
pattern
of
the
paper
that
covered
the
walls
roses
scattered
over
a
gray
background
and
the
straw
matting
that
did
duty
for
a
carpet
on
the
floor
the
armchair
the
table
and
the
smaller
chairs
were
made
of
wood
from
which
the
bark
had
not
been
removed
the
room
was
not
without
ornament
some
as
they
might
be
called
made
of
osiers
and
wooden
hoops
had
been
filled
with
moss
and
flowers
and
the
windows
were
draped
by
white
dimity
curtains
bordered
with
a
scarlet
fringe
there
was
a
mirror
above
the
where
a
plain
china
jar
stood
between
two
candlesticks
some
calico
lay
on
the
table
shirts
apparently
had
been
cut
out
and
begun
several
pairs
of
gussets
were
finished
and
a
scissors
needles
and
thread
and
all
a
s
requirements
lay
beside
them
everything
was
as
fresh
and
clean
as
a
shell
that
the
sea
had
tossed
up
on
the
beach
genestas
saw
that
a
kitchen
lay
on
the
other
side
of
the
passage
and
that
the
staircase
was
at
the
further
end
of
it
the
upper
story
like
the
ground
floor
evidently
consisted
of
two
rooms
only
come
do
not
be
frightened
benassis
was
saying
to
la
fosseuse
come
genestas
promptly
retreated
into
the
when
he
heard
these
words
and
in
another
moment
a
slender
girl
well
and
gracefully
made
appeared
in
the
doorway
she
wore
a
gown
of
cambric
covered
with
narrow
pink
stripes
and
cut
low
at
the
throat
so
as
to
display
a
muslin
chemisette
shyness
and
timidity
had
brought
the
color
to
a
face
which
had
nothing
very
remarkable
about
it
save
a
certain
flatness
of
feature
which
called
to
mind
the
cossack
and
russian
countenances
that
since
the
disasters
of
have
unfortunately
come
to
be
so
widely
known
in
france
la
fosseuse
was
in
fact
very
like
these
men
of
the
north
her
nose
turned
up
at
the
end
and
was
sunk
in
her
face
her
mouth
was
wide
and
her
chin
small
her
hands
and
arms
were
red
and
like
her
feet
were
of
the
peasant
type
large
and
strong
although
she
had
been
used
to
an
outdoor
life
to
exposure
to
the
sun
and
the
scorching
summer
winds
her
complexion
had
the
bleached
look
of
withered
grass
but
after
the
first
glance
this
made
her
face
more
interesting
and
there
was
such
a
sweet
expression
in
her
blue
eyes
so
much
grace
about
her
movements
and
such
music
in
her
voice
that
little
as
her
features
seemed
to
harmonize
with
the
disposition
which
benassis
had
praised
to
the
commandant
the
officer
recognized
in
her
the
capricious
and
ailing
creature
condemned
to
suffering
by
a
nature
that
had
been
thwarted
in
its
growth
la
fosseuse
deftly
stirred
the
fire
of
dry
branches
and
turfs
of
peat
then
sat
down
in
an
armchair
and
took
up
one
of
the
shirts
that
she
had
begun
she
sat
there
under
the
officer
s
eyes
half
bashful
afraid
to
look
up
and
calm
to
all
appearance
but
her
bodice
rose
and
fell
with
the
rapid
breathing
that
betrayed
her
nervousness
and
it
struck
genestas
that
her
figure
was
very
graceful
well
my
poor
child
is
your
work
going
on
nicely
said
benassis
taking
up
the
material
intended
for
the
shirts
and
passing
it
through
his
fingers
la
fosseuse
gave
the
doctor
a
timid
and
beseeching
glance
do
not
scold
me
sir
she
entreated
i
have
not
touched
them
although
they
were
ordered
by
you
and
for
people
who
need
them
very
badly
but
the
weather
has
been
so
fine
i
wandered
out
and
picked
a
quantity
of
mushrooms
and
white
truffles
and
took
them
over
to
jacquotte
she
was
very
pleased
for
some
people
are
coming
to
dinner
i
was
so
glad
that
i
thought
of
it
something
seemed
to
tell
me
to
go
to
look
for
she
began
to
ply
her
needle
again
you
have
a
very
pretty
house
here
mademoiselle
said
genestas
addressing
her
it
is
not
mine
at
all
sir
she
said
looking
at
the
stranger
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
grow
red
and
tearful
it
belongs
to
benassis
and
she
turned
towards
the
doctor
with
a
gentle
expression
on
her
face
you
know
quite
well
my
child
that
you
will
never
have
to
leave
it
he
said
as
he
took
her
hand
in
his
la
fosseuse
suddenly
rose
and
left
the
room
well
said
the
doctor
addressing
the
officer
what
do
you
think
of
her
there
is
something
strangely
touching
about
her
genestas
answered
how
very
nicely
you
have
fitted
up
this
little
nest
of
hers
bah
a
at
fifteen
or
twenty
sous
it
was
carefully
chosen
but
that
was
all
the
furniture
is
nothing
very
much
either
my
made
it
for
me
he
wanted
to
show
his
gratitude
and
la
fosseuse
made
the
curtains
herself
out
of
a
few
yards
of
calico
this
little
house
of
hers
and
her
simple
furniture
seem
pretty
to
you
because
you
come
upon
them
up
here
on
a
hillside
in
a
forlorn
part
of
the
world
where
you
did
not
expect
to
find
things
clean
and
tidy
the
reason
of
the
prettiness
is
a
kind
of
harmony
between
the
little
house
and
its
surroundings
nature
has
set
picturesque
groups
of
trees
and
running
streams
about
it
and
has
scattered
her
fairest
flowers
among
the
grass
her
wild
strawberry
blossoms
and
her
lovely
violets
well
what
is
the
matter
asked
benassis
as
la
fosseuse
came
back
to
them
oh
nothing
nothing
she
answered
i
fancied
that
one
of
my
chickens
was
missing
and
had
not
been
shut
her
remark
was
disingenuous
but
this
was
only
noticed
by
the
doctor
who
said
in
her
ear
you
have
been
crying
why
do
you
say
things
like
that
to
me
before
some
one
else
she
asked
in
reply
mademoiselle
said
genestas
it
is
a
great
pity
that
you
live
here
all
by
yourself
you
ought
to
have
a
mate
in
such
a
charming
cage
as
that
is
true
she
said
but
what
would
you
have
i
am
poor
and
i
am
hard
to
please
i
feel
that
it
would
not
suit
me
at
all
to
carry
the
soup
out
into
the
fields
nor
to
push
a
to
feel
the
misery
of
those
whom
i
should
love
and
have
no
power
to
put
an
end
to
it
to
carry
my
children
in
my
arms
all
day
and
patch
and
a
man
s
rags
the
cure
tells
me
that
such
thoughts
as
these
are
not
very
christian
i
know
that
myself
but
how
can
i
help
it
there
are
days
when
i
would
rather
eat
a
morsel
of
dry
bread
than
cook
anything
for
my
dinner
why
would
you
have
me
worry
some
man
s
life
out
with
my
failings
he
would
perhaps
work
himself
to
death
to
satisfy
my
whims
and
that
would
not
be
right
pshaw
an
unlucky
lot
has
fallen
to
me
and
i
ought
to
bear
it
by
and
besides
she
is
a
born
said
benassis
we
must
take
my
poor
fosseuse
as
we
find
her
but
all
that
she
has
been
saying
to
you
simply
means
that
she
has
never
loved
as
yet
he
added
smiling
then
he
rose
and
went
out
on
to
the
lawn
for
a
moment
you
must
be
very
fond
of
benassis
asked
genestas
oh
yes
sir
and
there
are
plenty
of
people
hereabouts
who
feel
as
i
do
that
they
would
be
glad
to
do
anything
in
the
world
for
him
and
yet
he
who
cures
other
people
has
some
trouble
of
his
own
that
nothing
can
cure
you
are
his
friend
perhaps
you
know
what
it
is
who
could
have
given
pain
to
such
a
man
who
is
the
very
image
of
god
on
earth
i
know
a
great
many
who
think
that
the
corn
grows
faster
if
he
has
passed
by
their
field
in
the
and
what
do
you
think
yourself
i
sir
when
i
have
seen
him
she
seemed
to
hesitate
then
she
went
on
i
am
happy
all
the
rest
of
the
she
bent
her
head
over
her
work
and
plied
her
needle
with
unwonted
swiftness
well
has
the
captain
been
telling
you
something
about
napoleon
said
the
doctor
as
he
came
in
again
have
you
seen
the
emperor
sir
cried
la
fosseuse
gazing
at
the
officer
s
face
with
eager
curiosity
said
genestas
hundreds
of
times
oh
how
i
should
like
to
know
something
about
the
army
perhaps
we
will
come
to
take
a
cup
of
coffee
with
you
and
you
shall
hear
something
about
the
army
dear
child
said
benassis
who
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
kissed
her
brow
she
is
my
daughter
you
see
he
added
turning
to
the
commandant
there
is
something
wanting
in
the
day
somehow
when
i
have
not
kissed
her
la
fosseuse
held
benassis
hand
in
a
tight
clasp
as
she
murmured
oh
you
are
very
kind
they
left
the
house
but
she
came
after
them
to
see
them
mount
she
waited
till
genestas
was
in
the
saddle
and
then
whispered
in
benassis
ear
tell
me
who
that
gentleman
is
aha
said
the
doctor
putting
a
foot
in
the
stirrup
a
husband
for
you
she
stood
on
the
spot
where
they
left
her
absorbed
in
watching
their
progress
down
the
steep
path
and
when
they
came
past
the
end
of
the
garden
they
saw
her
already
perched
on
a
little
heap
of
stones
so
that
she
might
still
keep
them
in
view
and
give
them
a
last
nod
of
farewell
there
is
something
very
unusual
about
that
girl
sir
genestas
said
to
the
doctor
when
they
had
left
the
house
far
behind
there
is
is
there
not
he
answered
many
a
time
i
have
said
to
myself
that
she
will
make
a
charming
wife
but
i
can
only
love
her
as
a
sister
or
a
daughter
and
in
no
other
way
my
heart
is
has
she
any
relations
asked
genestas
what
did
her
father
and
mother
do
oh
it
is
quite
a
long
story
answered
benassis
neither
her
father
nor
mother
nor
any
of
her
relations
are
living
everything
about
her
down
to
her
name
interested
me
la
fosseuse
was
born
here
in
the
town
her
father
a
laborer
from
saint
laurent
du
pont
was
nicknamed
which
is
no
doubt
a
contraction
of
for
the
office
of
sexton
had
been
in
his
family
time
out
of
mind
all
the
sad
associations
of
the
graveyard
hang
about
the
name
here
as
in
some
other
parts
of
france
there
is
an
old
custom
dating
from
the
times
of
the
latin
civilization
in
virtue
of
which
a
woman
takes
her
husband
s
name
with
the
addition
of
a
feminine
termination
and
this
girl
has
been
called
la
fosseuse
after
her
father
the
laborer
had
married
the
of
some
countess
or
other
who
owns
an
estate
at
a
distance
of
a
few
leagues
it
was
a
here
as
in
all
country
districts
love
is
a
very
small
element
in
a
marriage
the
peasant
as
a
rule
wants
a
wife
who
will
bear
him
children
a
housewife
who
will
make
good
soup
and
take
it
out
to
him
in
the
fields
who
will
spin
and
make
his
shirts
and
mend
his
clothes
such
a
thing
had
not
happened
for
a
long
while
in
a
district
where
a
young
man
not
unfrequently
leaves
his
betrothed
for
another
girl
who
is
richer
by
three
or
four
acres
of
land
the
fate
of
le
fosseur
and
his
wife
was
scarcely
happy
enough
to
induce
our
dauphinois
to
forsake
their
calculating
habits
and
practical
way
of
regarding
things
la
fosseuse
who
was
a
very
pretty
woman
died
when
her
daughter
was
born
and
her
husband
s
grief
for
his
loss
was
so
great
that
he
followed
her
within
the
year
leaving
nothing
in
the
world
to
this
little
one
except
an
existence
whose
continuance
was
very
doubtful
a
mere
feeble
flicker
of
a
life
a
charitable
neighbor
took
the
care
of
the
baby
upon
herself
and
brought
her
up
till
she
was
nine
years
old
then
the
burden
of
supporting
la
fosseuse
became
too
heavy
for
the
good
woman
so
at
the
time
of
year
when
travelers
are
passing
along
the
roads
she
sent
her
charge
to
beg
for
her
living
upon
the
highways
one
day
the
little
orphan
asked
for
bread
at
the
countess
chateau
and
they
kept
the
child
for
her
mother
s
sake
she
was
to
be
some
day
to
the
daughter
of
the
house
and
was
brought
up
to
this
end
her
young
mistress
was
married
five
years
later
but
meanwhile
the
poor
little
thing
was
the
victim
of
all
the
caprices
of
wealthy
people
whose
beneficence
for
the
most
part
is
not
to
be
depended
upon
even
while
it
lasts
they
are
generous
by
fits
and
starts
sometimes
patrons
sometimes
friends
sometimes
masters
in
this
way
they
falsify
the
already
false
position
of
the
poor
children
in
whom
they
interest
themselves
and
trifle
with
the
hearts
the
lives
and
futures
of
their
protegees
whom
they
regard
very
lightly
from
the
first
la
fosseuse
became
almost
a
companion
to
the
young
heiress
she
was
taught
to
read
and
write
and
her
future
mistress
sometimes
amused
herself
by
giving
her
music
lessons
she
was
treated
sometimes
as
a
lady
s
companion
sometimes
as
a
and
in
this
way
they
made
an
incomplete
being
of
her
she
acquired
a
taste
for
luxury
and
for
dress
together
with
manners
to
her
real
position
she
has
been
roughly
schooled
by
misfortune
since
then
but
the
vague
feeling
that
she
is
destined
for
a
higher
lot
has
not
been
effaced
in
her
a
day
came
at
last
however
a
fateful
day
for
the
poor
girl
when
the
young
countess
who
was
married
by
this
time
discovered
la
fosseuse
arrayed
in
one
of
her
ball
dresses
and
dancing
before
a
mirror
la
fosseuse
was
no
longer
anything
but
a
and
the
orphan
girl
then
sixteen
years
of
age
was
dismissed
without
pity
her
idle
ways
plunged
her
once
more
into
poverty
she
wandered
about
begging
by
the
roadside
and
working
at
times
as
i
have
told
you
sometimes
she
thought
of
drowning
herself
sometimes
also
of
giving
herself
to
the
first
comer
she
spent
most
of
her
time
thinking
dark
thoughts
lying
by
the
side
of
a
wall
in
the
sun
with
her
face
buried
in
the
grass
and
would
sometimes
throw
a
few
halfpence
to
her
simply
because
she
asked
them
for
nothing
one
whole
year
she
spent
in
a
hospital
at
annecy
after
heavy
toil
in
the
harvest
field
she
had
only
undertaken
the
work
in
the
hope
that
it
would
kill
her
and
that
so
she
might
die
you
should
hear
her
herself
when
she
speaks
of
her
feelings
and
ideas
during
this
time
of
her
life
her
simple
confidences
are
often
very
curious
she
came
back
to
the
little
town
at
last
just
about
the
time
when
i
decided
to
take
up
my
abode
in
it
i
wanted
to
understand
the
minds
of
the
people
beneath
my
rule
her
character
struck
me
and
i
made
a
study
of
it
then
when
i
became
aware
of
her
physical
infirmities
i
determined
to
watch
over
her
perhaps
in
time
she
may
grow
accustomed
to
work
with
her
needle
but
whatever
happens
i
have
secured
her
she
is
quite
alone
up
there
said
genestas
no
one
of
my
herdswomen
sleeps
in
the
house
the
doctor
answered
you
did
not
see
my
farm
buildings
which
lie
behind
the
house
they
are
hidden
by
the
oh
she
is
quite
safe
moreover
there
are
no
mauvais
sujets
here
in
the
valley
if
any
come
among
us
by
any
chance
i
send
them
into
the
army
where
they
make
excellent
poor
girl
said
genestas
oh
the
folk
round
about
do
not
pity
her
at
all
said
benassis
on
the
other
hand
they
think
her
very
lucky
but
there
is
this
difference
between
her
and
the
other
women
god
has
given
strength
to
them
and
weakness
to
her
and
they
do
not
see
the
moment
that
the
two
horsemen
came
out
upon
the
road
to
grenoble
benassis
stopped
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
a
different
view
had
suddenly
opened
out
before
them
he
foresaw
its
effect
upon
genestas
and
wished
to
enjoy
his
surprise
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
two
green
walls
sixty
feet
high
rose
above
a
road
which
was
rounded
like
a
garden
path
the
trees
had
not
been
cut
or
trimmed
each
one
preserved
the
magnificent
shape
that
makes
the
lombard
poplar
one
of
the
grandest
of
trees
there
they
stood
a
natural
monument
which
a
man
might
well
be
proud
of
having
reared
the
shadow
had
already
reached
one
side
of
the
road
transforming
it
into
a
vast
wall
of
black
leaves
but
the
setting
sun
shone
full
upon
the
other
side
which
stood
out
in
contrast
for
the
young
leaves
at
the
tips
of
every
branch
had
been
dyed
a
bright
golden
hue
and
as
the
breeze
stirred
through
the
waving
curtain
it
gleamed
in
the
light
you
must
be
very
happy
here
cried
genestas
the
sight
of
this
must
be
all
pleasure
to
the
love
of
nature
is
the
only
love
that
does
not
deceive
human
hopes
there
is
no
disappointment
here
said
the
doctor
those
poplars
are
ten
years
old
have
you
ever
seen
any
that
are
better
grown
than
these
of
mine
god
is
great
said
the
soldier
coming
to
a
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
road
of
which
he
saw
neither
beginning
nor
end
you
do
me
good
cried
benassis
it
was
a
pleasure
to
hear
you
say
over
again
what
i
have
so
often
said
in
the
midst
of
this
avenue
there
is
something
holy
about
this
place
here
we
are
like
two
mere
specks
and
the
feeling
of
our
own
littleness
always
brings
us
into
the
presence
of
they
rode
on
slowly
and
in
silence
listening
to
their
horses
the
sound
echoed
along
the
green
corridor
as
it
might
have
done
beneath
the
vaulted
roof
of
a
cathedral
how
many
things
have
a
power
to
stir
us
which
do
not
suspect
said
the
doctor
do
you
not
notice
the
sweet
scent
given
off
by
the
gum
of
the
poplar
buds
and
the
resin
of
the
larches
how
delightful
it
is
listen
exclaimed
genestas
let
us
wait
a
a
distant
sound
of
singing
came
to
their
ears
is
it
a
woman
or
a
man
or
is
it
a
bird
asked
the
commandant
in
a
low
voice
is
it
the
voice
of
this
wonderful
landscape
it
is
something
of
all
these
things
the
doctor
answered
as
he
dismounted
and
fastened
his
horse
to
a
branch
of
a
poplar
tree
he
made
a
sign
to
the
officer
to
follow
his
example
and
to
come
with
him
they
went
slowly
along
a
footpath
between
two
hedges
of
blossoming
hawthorn
which
filled
the
damp
evening
air
with
its
delicate
fragrance
the
sun
shone
full
into
the
pathway
the
light
and
warmth
were
very
perceptible
after
the
shade
thrown
by
the
long
wall
of
poplar
trees
the
still
powerful
rays
poured
a
flood
of
red
light
over
a
cottage
at
the
end
of
the
stony
track
the
ridge
of
the
cottage
roof
was
usually
a
bright
green
with
its
overgrowth
of
mosses
and
and
the
thatch
was
brown
as
a
chestnut
shell
but
just
now
it
seemed
to
be
powdered
with
a
golden
dust
the
cottage
itself
was
scarcely
visible
through
the
haze
of
light
the
ruinous
wall
the
doorway
and
everything
about
it
was
radiant
with
a
fleeting
glory
and
a
beauty
due
to
chance
such
as
is
sometimes
seen
for
an
instant
in
a
human
face
beneath
the
influence
of
a
strong
emotion
that
brings
warmth
and
color
into
it
in
a
life
under
the
open
sky
and
among
the
fields
the
transient
and
tender
grace
of
such
moments
as
these
draws
from
us
the
wish
of
the
apostle
who
said
to
jesus
christ
upon
the
mountain
let
us
build
a
tabernacle
and
dwell
the
wide
landscape
seemed
at
that
moment
to
have
found
a
voice
whose
purity
and
sweetness
equaled
its
own
sweetness
and
purity
a
voice
as
mournful
as
the
dying
light
in
the
west
for
a
vague
reminder
of
death
is
divinely
set
in
the
heavens
and
the
sun
above
gives
the
same
warning
that
is
given
here
on
earth
by
the
flowers
and
the
bright
insects
of
the
day
there
is
a
tinge
of
sadness
about
the
radiance
of
sunset
and
the
melody
was
sad
it
was
a
song
widely
known
in
the
days
of
yore
a
ballad
of
love
and
sorrow
that
once
had
served
to
stir
a
national
hatred
of
france
for
england
beaumarchais
in
a
later
day
had
given
it
back
its
true
poetry
by
adapting
it
for
the
french
theatre
and
putting
it
into
the
mouth
of
a
page
who
pours
out
his
heart
to
his
stepmother
just
now
it
was
simply
the
air
that
rose
and
fell
there
were
no
words
the
plaintive
voice
of
the
singer
touched
and
thrilled
the
soul
it
is
the
swan
s
song
said
benassis
that
voice
does
not
sound
twice
in
a
century
for
human
ears
let
us
hurry
we
must
put
a
stop
to
the
singing
the
child
is
killing
himself
it
would
be
cruel
to
listen
to
him
any
longer
be
quiet
jacques
come
come
be
quiet
cried
the
doctor
the
music
ceased
genestas
stood
motionless
and
overcome
with
astonishment
a
cloud
had
drifted
across
the
sun
the
landscape
and
the
voice
were
both
mute
shadow
chillness
and
silence
had
taken
the
place
of
the
soft
glory
of
the
light
the
warm
breath
of
the
breeze
and
the
child
s
singing
what
makes
you
disobey
me
asked
benassis
i
shall
not
bring
you
any
more
rice
pudding
nor
snail
broth
no
more
fresh
dates
and
white
bread
for
you
so
you
want
to
die
and
break
your
poor
mother
s
heart
do
you
genestas
came
into
a
little
yard
which
was
sufficiently
clean
and
tidily
kept
and
saw
before
him
a
lad
of
fifteen
who
looked
as
delicate
as
a
woman
his
hair
was
fair
but
scanty
and
the
color
in
his
face
was
so
bright
that
it
seemed
hardly
natural
he
rose
up
slowly
from
the
bench
where
he
was
sitting
beneath
a
thick
bush
of
jessamine
and
some
blossoming
lilacs
that
were
running
riot
so
that
he
was
almost
hidden
among
the
leaves
you
know
very
well
said
the
doctor
that
i
told
you
not
to
talk
not
to
expose
yourself
to
the
chilly
evening
air
and
to
go
to
bed
as
soon
as
the
sun
was
set
what
put
it
into
your
head
to
sing
benassis
it
was
so
very
warm
out
here
and
it
is
so
nice
to
feel
warm
i
am
always
cold
i
felt
so
happy
that
without
thinking
i
began
to
try
over
s
en
just
for
fun
and
then
i
began
to
listen
to
myself
because
my
voice
was
something
like
the
sound
of
the
flute
your
shepherd
well
my
poor
jacques
this
must
not
happen
again
do
you
hear
let
me
have
your
hand
and
the
doctor
felt
his
pulse
the
boy
s
eyes
had
their
usual
sweet
expression
but
just
now
they
shone
with
a
feverish
light
it
is
just
as
i
thought
you
are
covered
with
perspiration
said
benassis
your
mother
has
not
come
in
yet
no
come
go
and
get
into
the
young
invalid
went
back
into
the
cottage
followed
by
benassis
and
the
officer
just
light
a
candle
captain
bluteau
said
the
doctor
who
was
helping
jacques
to
take
off
his
rough
tattered
clothing
when
genestas
had
struck
a
light
and
the
interior
of
the
room
was
visible
he
was
surprised
by
the
extreme
thinness
of
the
child
who
seemed
to
be
little
more
than
skin
and
bone
when
the
little
peasant
had
been
put
to
bed
benassis
tapped
the
lad
s
chest
and
listened
to
the
ominous
sounds
made
in
this
way
by
his
fingers
then
after
some
deliberation
he
drew
back
the
coverlet
over
jacques
stepped
back
a
few
paces
folded
his
arms
across
his
chest
and
closely
scrutinized
his
patient
how
do
you
feel
my
little
man
quite
comfortable
a
table
with
four
spindle
legs
stood
in
the
room
the
doctor
drew
it
up
to
the
bed
found
a
tumbler
and
a
phial
on
the
and
composed
a
draught
by
carefully
measuring
a
few
drops
of
brown
liquid
from
the
phial
into
some
water
genestas
holding
the
light
the
while
your
mother
is
very
she
is
coming
sir
said
the
child
i
can
hear
her
footsteps
on
the
the
doctor
and
the
officer
looked
around
them
while
they
waited
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
there
was
a
sort
of
mattress
made
of
moss
on
which
doubtless
the
mother
was
wont
to
sleep
in
her
clothes
for
there
were
neither
sheets
nor
coverlet
genestas
pointed
out
this
bed
to
benassis
who
nodded
slightly
to
show
that
he
likewise
had
already
admired
this
motherly
devotion
there
was
a
clatter
of
sabots
in
the
yard
and
the
doctor
went
out
you
will
have
to
sit
up
with
jacques
mother
colas
if
he
tells
you
that
his
breathing
is
bad
you
must
let
him
drink
some
of
the
draught
that
i
have
poured
into
the
tumbler
on
the
table
take
care
not
to
let
him
have
more
than
two
or
three
sips
at
a
time
there
ought
to
be
enough
in
the
tumbler
to
last
him
all
through
the
night
above
all
things
do
not
touch
the
phial
and
change
the
child
s
clothing
at
once
he
is
perspiring
i
could
not
manage
to
wash
his
shirts
sir
i
had
to
take
the
hemp
over
to
grenoble
as
we
wanted
the
very
well
then
i
will
send
you
some
then
is
he
worse
my
poor
lad
asked
the
woman
he
has
been
so
imprudent
as
to
sing
mother
colas
and
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
any
good
can
come
of
it
but
do
not
be
hard
upon
him
nor
scold
him
do
not
be
about
it
and
if
jacques
complains
overmuch
send
a
neighbor
to
fetch
me
the
doctor
called
to
his
friend
and
they
went
back
along
the
is
that
little
peasant
consumptive
asked
genestas
yes
answered
benassis
science
can
not
save
him
unless
nature
works
a
miracle
our
professors
at
the
ecole
de
medecine
in
paris
often
used
to
speak
to
us
of
the
phenomenon
which
you
have
just
witnessed
some
maladies
of
this
kind
bring
about
changes
in
the
organs
that
give
the
sufferer
a
power
of
song
that
no
trained
voice
can
surpass
i
have
made
you
spend
a
melancholy
day
sir
said
the
doctor
when
he
was
once
more
in
the
saddle
suffering
and
death
everywhere
but
everywhere
also
resignation
all
these
peasant
folk
take
death
philosophically
they
fall
ill
say
nothing
about
it
and
take
to
their
beds
like
dumb
animals
but
let
us
say
no
more
about
death
and
let
us
quicken
our
horses
paces
a
little
we
ought
to
reach
the
town
before
nightfall
so
that
you
may
see
the
new
eh
some
place
is
on
fire
over
there
said
genestas
pointing
to
a
spot
on
the
mountain
where
a
sheaf
of
flames
was
rising
it
is
not
a
dangerous
fire
our
is
heating
his
kiln
no
doubt
it
is
a
industry
which
turns
our
heather
to
there
was
the
sudden
report
of
a
gun
followed
by
an
involuntary
exclamation
from
benassis
who
said
with
an
impatient
gesture
if
that
is
butifer
we
shall
see
which
of
us
two
is
the
the
shot
came
from
that
quarter
said
genestas
indicating
a
up
above
them
on
the
mountain
side
yes
up
there
you
may
trust
an
old
soldier
s
let
us
go
there
at
once
cried
benassis
and
he
made
straight
for
the
little
wood
urging
his
horse
at
a
furious
speed
across
the
ditches
and
fields
as
if
he
were
riding
a
steeplechase
in
his
anxiety
to
catch
the
sportsman
the
man
you
are
after
has
made
off
shouted
genestas
who
could
scarcely
keep
up
with
him
benassis
wheeled
his
horse
round
sharply
and
came
back
again
the
man
of
whom
he
was
in
search
soon
appeared
on
the
top
of
a
perpendicular
crag
a
hundred
feet
above
the
level
of
the
two
horsemen
butifer
shouted
benassis
when
he
saw
that
this
figure
carried
a
come
down
butifer
recognized
the
doctor
and
replied
by
a
respectful
and
friendly
sign
which
showed
that
he
had
every
intention
of
obeying
i
can
imagine
that
if
a
man
were
driven
to
it
by
fear
or
by
some
overmastering
impulse
that
he
might
possibly
contrive
to
scramble
up
to
that
point
among
the
rocks
said
genestas
but
how
will
he
manage
to
come
down
again
i
have
no
anxiety
on
that
score
answered
benassis
the
wild
goats
must
feel
envious
of
that
fellow
yonder
you
will
the
emergencies
of
warfare
had
accustomed
the
commandant
to
gauge
the
real
worth
of
men
he
admired
the
wonderful
quickness
of
butifer
s
movements
the
grace
with
which
the
hunter
swung
himself
down
the
rugged
sides
of
the
crag
to
the
top
of
which
he
had
so
boldly
climbed
the
strong
slender
form
of
the
mountaineer
was
gracefully
poised
in
every
attitude
which
the
precipitous
nature
of
the
path
compelled
him
to
assume
and
so
certain
did
he
seem
of
his
power
to
hold
on
at
need
that
if
the
pinnacle
of
rock
on
which
he
took
his
stand
had
been
a
level
floor
he
could
not
have
set
his
foot
down
upon
it
more
calmly
he
carried
his
as
if
it
had
been
a
light
butifer
was
a
young
man
of
middle
height
thin
muscular
and
in
good
training
his
beauty
was
of
a
masculine
order
which
impressed
genestas
on
a
closer
view
evidently
he
belonged
to
the
class
of
smugglers
who
ply
their
trade
without
resorting
to
violent
courses
and
who
only
exert
patience
and
craft
to
defraud
the
government
his
face
was
manly
and
sunburned
his
eyes
which
were
bright
as
an
eagle
s
were
of
a
clear
yellow
color
and
his
nose
with
its
slight
curve
at
the
tip
was
very
much
like
an
eagle
s
beak
his
cheeks
were
covered
with
down
his
red
lips
were
half
open
giving
a
glimpse
of
a
set
of
teeth
of
dazzling
whiteness
his
beard
moustache
and
the
reddish
whiskers
which
he
allowed
to
grow
and
which
curled
naturally
still
further
heightened
the
masculine
and
forbidding
expression
of
his
face
everything
about
him
spoke
of
strength
he
was
constant
activity
had
made
the
muscles
of
his
hands
curiously
firm
and
prominent
there
was
the
quick
intelligence
of
a
savage
about
his
glances
he
looked
resolute
fearless
and
imperturbable
like
a
man
accustomed
to
put
his
life
in
peril
and
whose
physical
and
mental
strength
had
been
so
often
tried
by
dangers
of
every
kind
that
he
no
longer
felt
any
doubts
about
himself
he
wore
a
blouse
that
had
suffered
a
good
deal
from
thorns
and
briars
and
he
had
a
pair
of
leather
soles
bound
to
his
feet
by
thongs
and
a
pair
of
torn
and
tattered
blue
linen
breeches
through
which
his
legs
were
visible
red
wiry
hard
and
muscular
as
those
of
a
stag
there
you
see
the
man
who
once
fired
a
shot
at
me
benassis
remarked
to
the
commandant
in
a
low
voice
if
at
this
moment
i
were
to
signify
to
him
my
desire
to
be
rid
of
any
one
he
would
kill
them
without
butifer
he
went
on
addressing
the
poacher
i
fully
believed
you
to
be
a
man
of
your
word
i
pledged
mine
for
you
because
i
had
your
promise
my
promise
to
the
du
at
grenoble
was
based
upon
your
vow
never
to
go
poaching
again
and
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
become
a
steady
industrious
worker
you
fired
that
shot
just
now
and
here
you
are
on
the
comte
de
labranchoir
s
estate
eh
you
miscreant
suppose
his
keeper
had
happened
to
hear
you
it
is
a
lucky
thing
for
you
that
i
shall
take
no
formal
cognizance
of
this
offence
if
i
did
you
would
come
up
as
an
old
offender
and
of
course
you
have
no
gun
license
i
let
you
keep
that
gun
of
yours
out
of
tenderness
for
your
attachment
to
the
it
is
a
beauty
said
the
commandant
who
recognized
a
duck
gun
from
sainte
etienne
the
smuggler
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
genestas
by
way
of
acknowledging
the
compliment
butifer
continued
benassis
if
your
conscience
does
not
reproach
you
it
ought
to
do
so
if
you
are
going
to
begin
your
old
tricks
again
you
will
find
yourself
once
more
in
a
park
enclosed
by
four
stone
walls
and
no
power
on
earth
will
save
you
from
the
hulks
you
will
be
a
marked
man
and
your
character
will
be
ruined
bring
your
gun
to
me
i
will
take
care
of
it
for
butifer
gripped
the
barrel
of
his
weapon
in
a
convulsive
clutch
you
are
right
sir
he
said
i
have
done
wrong
i
have
broken
bounds
i
am
a
cur
my
gun
ought
to
go
to
you
but
when
you
take
it
away
from
me
you
take
all
that
i
have
in
the
world
the
last
shot
which
my
mother
s
son
will
fire
shall
be
through
my
own
head
what
would
you
have
i
did
as
you
wanted
me
i
kept
quiet
all
winter
but
the
spring
came
and
the
sap
rose
i
am
not
used
to
day
labor
it
is
not
in
my
nature
to
spend
my
life
in
fattening
fowls
i
can
not
stoop
about
turning
over
the
soil
for
vegetables
nor
flourish
a
whip
and
drive
a
cart
nor
scrub
down
a
horse
in
a
stable
all
my
life
so
i
must
die
of
starvation
i
suppose
i
am
only
happy
when
i
am
up
there
he
went
on
after
a
pause
pointing
to
the
mountains
and
i
have
been
about
among
the
hills
for
the
past
week
i
got
a
sight
of
a
chamois
and
i
have
the
chamois
there
he
said
pointing
to
the
top
of
the
crag
it
is
at
your
service
dear
benassis
leave
me
my
gun
listen
i
will
leave
the
commune
de
i
will
go
to
the
alps
the
will
not
say
a
word
on
the
contrary
they
will
receive
me
with
open
arms
i
shall
come
to
grief
at
the
bottom
of
some
glacier
but
if
i
am
to
speak
my
mind
i
would
rather
live
for
a
couple
of
years
among
the
heights
where
there
are
no
governments
nor
excisemen
nor
gamekeepers
nor
procureurs
du

than
grovel
in
a
marsh
for
a
century
you
are
the
only
one
that
i
shall
be
sorry
to
leave
behind
all
the
rest
of
them

me

you
are
in
the
right
at
any
rate
you

the
mountains
oh
you
shall
not
go
to
the
alps
cried
benassis
a
man
like
you
a
man
of
his
word
with
plenty
of
good
stuff
in
him
ought
to
serve
his
country
and
command
a
brigade
and
not
come
to
his
end
trailing
after
a
chamois
the
life
that
you
are
leading
will
take
you
straight
to
the
convict
s
prison
after
yourself
you
are
obliged
to
take
a
long
rest
and
in
the
end
you
will
fall
into
idle
ways
that
will
be
the
ruin
of
any
notions
of
orderly
existence
that
you
have
you
will
get
into
the
habit
of
putting
your
strength
to
bad
uses
and
you
will
take
the
law
into
your
own
hands
i
want
to
put
you
in
spite
of
yourself
into
the
right
so
i
am
to
pine
and
fret
myself
to
death
i
feel
suffocated
whenever
i
am
in
a
town
i
can
not
hold
out
for
more
than
a
day
in
grenoble
when
i
take
louise
there
we
all
have
our
whims
which
we
must
manage
to
control
or
turn
them
to
account
for
our
neighbor
s
benefit
but
it
is
late
and
i
am
in
a
hurry
come
to
see
me
and
bring
your
gun
along
with
you
we
will
talk
this
over
my
boy
go
and
sell
your
chamois
in
the
two
horsemen
went
on
their
way
that
is
what
i
call
a
man
said
genestas
a
man
in
a
bad
way
answered
benassis
but
what
help
is
there
for
it
you
heard
what
he
said
is
it
not
lamentable
to
see
such
fine
qualities
running
to
waste
if
france
were
invaded
by
a
foreign
foe
butifer
at
the
head
of
a
hundred
young
fellows
would
keep
a
whole
division
busy
in
maurienne
for
a
month
but
in
a
time
of
peace
the
only
outlets
for
his
energy
are
those
which
set
the
law
at
defiance
he
must
wrestle
with
something
whenever
he
is
not
risking
his
neck
he
is
at
odds
with
society
he
lends
a
helping
hand
to
smugglers
the
rogue
will
cross
the
rhone
all
by
himself
in
a
little
boat
to
take
shoes
over
into
savoy
he
makes
good
his
retreat
heavy
laden
as
he
is
to
some
inaccessible
place
high
up
among
the
hills
where
he
stays
for
two
days
at
a
time
living
on
dry
crusts
in
short
danger
is
as
welcome
to
him
as
sleep
would
be
to
anybody
else
and
by
dint
of
experience
he
has
acquired
a
relish
for
extreme
sensations
that
has
totally
unfitted
him
for
ordinary
life
it
vexes
me
that
a
man
like
that
should
take
a
wrong
turn
and
gradually
go
to
the
bad
become
a
bandit
and
die
on
the
gallows
but
see
captain
how
our
village
looks
from
here
genestas
obtained
a
distant
view
of
a
wide
circular
space
planted
with
trees
a
fountain
surrounded
by
poplars
stood
in
the
middle
of
it
round
the
enclosure
were
high
banks
on
which
a
triple
line
of
trees
of
different
kinds
were
growing
the
first
row
consisted
of
acacias
the
second
of
japanese
varnish
trees
and
some
young
elms
grew
on
the
highest
row
of
all
that
is
where
we
hold
our
fair
said
benassis
that
is
the
beginning
of
the
high
street
by
those
two
handsome
houses
that
i
told
you
about
one
belongs
to
the
notary
and
the
other
to
the
justice
of
the
they
came
at
that
moment
into
a
broad
road
fairly
evenly
paved
with
large
there
were
altogether
about
a
hundred
new
houses
on
either
side
of
it
and
almost
every
house
stood
in
a
garden
the
view
of
the
church
with
its
doorway
made
a
pretty
termination
to
this
road
two
more
roads
had
been
recently
planned
out
down
the
course
of
the
first
and
many
new
houses
had
already
been
built
along
them
the
stood
opposite
the
parsonage
in
the
square
by
the
church
as
benassis
went
down
the
road
women
and
children
stood
in
their
doorways
to
wish
him
the
men
took
off
their
caps
and
the
little
children
danced
and
shouted
about
his
horse
as
if
the
animal
s
were
as
well
known
as
the
kindness
of
its
master
the
gladness
was
undemonstrative
there
was
the
instinctive
delicacy
of
all
deep
feeling
about
it
and
it
had
the
same
pervasive
power
at
the
sight
of
this
welcome
it
seemed
to
genestas
that
the
doctor
had
been
too
modest
in
his
description
of
the
affection
with
which
he
was
regarded
by
the
people
of
the
district
his
truly
was
a
sovereignty
of
the
sweetest
kind
a
right
royal
sovereignty
moreover
for
its
title
was
engraven
in
the
hearts
of
its
subjects
however
dazzling
the
rays
of
glory
that
surround
a
man
however
great
the
power
that
he
enjoys
in
his
inmost
soul
he
soon
comes
to
a
just
estimate
of
the
sentiments
that
all
external
action
causes
for
him
he
very
soon
sees
that
no
change
has
been
wrought
in
him
that
there
is
nothing
new
and
nothing
greater
in
the
exercise
of
his
physical
faculties
and
discovers
his
own
real
nothingness
kings
even
should
they
rule
over
the
whole
world
are
condemned
to
live
in
a
narrow
circle
like
other
men
they
must
even
submit
to
the
conditions
of
their
lot
and
their
happiness
depends
upon
the
personal
impressions
that
they
receive
but
benassis
met
with
nothing
but
goodwill
and
loyalty
throughout
the
district
chapter
iii
the
napoleon
of
the
people
pray
come
in
sir
cried
jacquotte
a
pretty
time
the
gentlemen
have
been
waiting
for
you
it
is
always
the
way
you
always
manage
to
spoil
the
dinner
for
me
whenever
it
ought
to
be
particularly
good
everything
is
cooked
to
death
by
this
time
oh
well
here
we
are
answered
benassis
with
a
smile
the
two
horsemen
dismounted
and
went
off
to
the
salon
where
the
guests
invited
by
the
doctor
were
assembled
gentlemen
he
said
taking
genestas
by
the
hand
i
have
the
honor
of
introducing
you
to
bluteau
captain
of
a
regiment
of
cavalry
stationed
at
grenoble
an
old
soldier
who
has
promised
me
that
he
will
stay
among
us
for
a
little
then
turning
to
genestas
he
presented
to
him
a
tall
thin
man
dressed
in
black
this
gentleman
said
benassis
is
dufau
the
justice
of
the
peace
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
to
you
and
who
has
so
largely
contributed
to
the
prosperity
of
the
then
he
led
his
guest
up
to
a
pale
slight
young
man
of
middle
height
who
wore
spectacles
and
was
also
dressed
in
black
and
this
is
tonnelet
he
went
on
m
gravier
s
and
the
first
notary
who
came
to
the
the
doctor
next
turned
to
a
stout
man
who
seemed
to
belong
half
to
the
peasant
half
to
the
middle
class
the
owner
of
a
but
countenance
this
is
my
worthy
colleague
cambon
he
went
on
the
to
whom
i
owe
the
confidence
and
of
the
people
here
he
was
one
of
the
promoters
of
the
road
which
you
have
admired
i
have
no
need
to
tell
you
the
profession
of
this
gentleman
benassis
added
turning
to
the
curate
here
is
a
man
whom
no
one
can
help
there
was
an
irresistible
attraction
in
the
moral
beauty
expressed
by
the
cure
s
countenance
which
engrossed
genestas
attention
yet
a
certain
harshness
and
austerity
of
outline
might
make
janvier
s
face
seem
unpleasing
at
a
first
glance
his
attitude
and
his
slight
emaciated
frame
showed
that
he
was
far
from
strong
physically
but
the
unchanging
serenity
of
his
face
bore
witness
to
the
profound
inward
peace
of
heart
heaven
seemed
to
be
reflected
in
his
eyes
and
the
inextinguishable
fervor
of
charity
which
glowed
in
his
heart
appeared
to
shine
from
them
the
gestures
that
he
made
but
rarely
were
simple
and
natural
his
appeared
to
be
a
quiet
and
retiring
nature
and
there
was
a
modesty
and
simplicity
like
that
of
a
young
girl
about
his
actions
at
first
sight
he
inspired
respect
and
a
vague
desire
to
be
admitted
to
his
friendship
ah
le
maire
he
said
bending
as
though
to
escape
from
benassis
eulogium
something
in
the
cure
s
tones
brought
a
thrill
to
genestas
heart
and
the
two
insignificant
words
uttered
by
this
stranger
priest
plunged
him
into
musings
that
were
almost
devout
gentlemen
said
jacquotte
who
came
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
there
took
her
stand
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
the
soup
is
on
the
invited
by
benassis
who
summoned
each
in
turn
so
as
to
avoid
questions
of
precedence
the
doctor
s
five
guests
went
into
the
and
after
the
cure
in
low
and
quiet
tones
had
repeated
a
they
took
their
places
at
table
the
cloth
that
covered
the
table
was
of
that
peculiar
kind
of
damask
linen
invented
in
the
time
of
henry
iv
by
the
brothers
graindorge
the
skilful
weavers
who
gave
their
name
to
the
heavy
fabric
so
well
known
to
housekeepers
the
linen
was
of
dazzling
whiteness
and
fragrant
with
the
scent
of
the
thyme
that
jacquotte
always
put
into
her
the
dinner
service
was
of
white
porcelain
edged
with
blue
and
was
in
perfect
order
the
decanters
were
of
the
octagonal
kind
still
in
use
in
the
provinces
though
they
have
disappeared
elsewhere
grotesque
figures
had
been
carved
on
the
horn
handles
of
the
knives
these
relics
of
ancient
splendor
which
nevertheless
looked
almost
new
seemed
to
those
who
scrutinized
them
to
be
in
keeping
with
the
kindly
and
nature
of
the
master
of
the
house
the
lid
of
the
drew
a
momentary
glance
from
genestas
he
noticed
that
it
was
surmounted
by
a
group
of
vegetables
in
high
relief
skilfully
colored
after
the
manner
of
bernard
palissy
the
celebrated
sixteenth
century
craftsman
there
was
no
lack
of
character
about
the
group
of
men
thus
assembled
the
powerful
heads
of
genestas
and
benassis
contrasted
admirably
with
janvier
s
apostolic
countenance
and
in
the
same
fashion
the
elderly
faces
of
the
justice
of
the
peace
and
the
brought
out
the
youthfulness
of
the
notary
society
seemed
to
be
represented
by
these
various
types
the
expression
of
each
one
indicated
contentment
with
himself
and
with
the
present
and
a
faith
in
the
future
tonnelet
and
janvier
who
were
still
young
loved
to
make
forecasts
of
coming
events
for
they
felt
that
the
future
was
theirs
while
the
other
guests
were
fain
rather
to
turn
their
talk
upon
the
past
all
of
them
faced
the
things
of
life
seriously
and
their
opinions
seemed
to
reflect
a
double
tinge
of
soberness
on
the
one
hand
from
the
twilight
hues
of
forgotten
joys
that
could
never
more
be
revived
for
them
and
on
the
other
from
the
gray
dawn
which
gave
promise
of
a
glorious
day
you
must
have
had
a
very
tiring
day
sir
said
cambon
addressing
the
cure
yes
sir
answered
janvier
the
poor
cretin
and
pere
pelletier
were
buried
at
different
now
we
can
pull
down
all
the
hovels
of
the
old
village
benassis
remarked
to
his
deputy
when
the
space
on
which
the
houses
stand
has
been
grubbed
up
it
will
mean
at
least
another
acre
of
meadow
land
for
us
and
furthermore
there
will
be
a
clear
saving
to
the
commune
of
the
hundred
francs
that
it
used
to
cost
to
keep
chautard
the
for
the
next
three
years
we
ought
to
lay
out
the
hundred
francs
in
making
a
bridge
to
carry
the
lower
road
over
the
main
stream
said
cambon
the
townsfolk
and
the
people
down
the
valley
have
fallen
into
the
way
of
taking
a
short
cut
across
that
patch
of
land
of
jean
francois
pastoureau
s
before
they
have
done
they
will
cut
it
up
in
a
way
that
will
do
a
lot
of
harm
to
that
poor
i
am
sure
that
the
money
could
not
be
put
to
a
better
use
said
the
justice
of
peace
in
my
opinion
the
abuse
of
the
right
of
way
is
one
of
the
worst
nuisances
in
a
country
district
of
the
cases
that
come
before
the
court
are
caused
by
unfair
easement
the
rights
of
property
are
infringed
in
this
way
almost
with
impunity
in
many
and
many
a
commune
a
respect
for
the
law
and
a
respect
for
property
are
ideas
too
often
disregarded
in
france
and
it
is
most
important
that
they
should
be
inculcated
many
people
think
that
there
is
something
dishonorable
in
assisting
the
law
to
take
its
course
go
and
be
hanged
somewhere
else
is
a
saying
which
seems
to
be
dictated
by
an
unpraiseworthy
generosity
of
feeling
but
at
the
bottom
it
is
nothing
but
a
hypocritical
formula
a
sort
of
veil
which
we
throw
over
our
own
selfishness
let
us
own
to
it
we
lack
patriotism
the
true
patriot
is
the
citizen
who
is
so
deeply
impressed
with
a
sense
of
the
importance
of
the
laws
that
he
will
see
them
carried
out
even
at
his
own
cost
and
inconvenience
if
you
let
the
criminal
go
in
peace
are
you
not
making
yourself
answerable
for
the
crimes
he
will
commit
it
is
all
of
a
piece
said
benassis
if
the
mayors
kept
their
roads
in
better
order
there
would
not
be
so
many
footpaths
and
if
the
members
of
municipal
councils
knew
a
little
better
they
would
uphold
the
small
landowner
and
the
mayor
when
the
two
combine
to
oppose
the
establishment
of
unfair
easements
the
fact
that
chateau
cottage
field
and
tree
are
all
equally
sacred
would
then
be
brought
home
in
every
way
to
the
ignorant
they
would
be
made
to
understand
that
right
is
just
the
same
in
all
cases
whether
the
value
of
the
property
in
question
be
large
or
small
but
such
salutary
changes
can
not
be
brought
about
all
at
once
they
depend
almost
entirely
on
the
moral
condition
of
the
population
which
we
can
never
completely
reform
without
the
potent
aid
of
the
cures
this
remark
does
not
apply
to
you
in
any
way
nor
do
i
take
it
to
myself
laughed
the
cure
is
not
my
heart
set
on
bringing
the
teaching
of
the
catholic
religion
to
with
your
plans
of
administration
for
instance
i
have
often
tried
in
my
pulpit
discourses
on
theft
to
imbue
the
folk
of
this
parish
with
the
very
ideas
of
right
to
which
you
have
just
given
utterance
for
truly
god
does
not
estimate
theft
by
the
value
of
the
thing
stolen
he
looks
at
the
thief
that
has
been
the
gist
of
the
parables
which
i
have
tried
to
adapt
to
the
comprehension
of
my
you
have
succeeded
sir
said
cambon
i
know
the
change
you
have
brought
about
in
people
s
ways
of
looking
at
things
for
i
can
compare
the
commune
as
it
is
now
with
the
commune
as
it
used
to
be
there
are
certainly
very
few
places
where
the
laborers
are
as
careful
as
ours
are
about
keeping
the
time
in
their
working
hours
the
cattle
are
well
looked
after
any
damage
that
they
do
is
done
by
accident
there
is
no
pilfering
in
the
woods
and
finally
you
have
made
our
peasants
clearly
understand
that
the
leisure
of
the
rich
is
the
reward
of
a
thrifty
and
well
then
said
genestas
you
ought
to
be
pretty
well
pleased
with
your
infantry
le
we
can
not
expect
to
find
angels
anywhere
here
below
captain
answered
the
priest
wherever
there
is
poverty
there
is
suffering
too
and
suffering
and
poverty
are
strong
compelling
forces
which
have
their
abuses
just
as
power
has
when
the
peasants
have
a
couple
of
leagues
to
walk
to
their
work
and
have
to
tramp
back
wearily
in
the
evening
they
perhaps
see
sportsmen
taking
short
cuts
over
ploughed
land
and
pasture
so
as
to
be
back
to
dinner
a
little
sooner
and
is
it
to
be
supposed
that
they
will
hesitate
to
follow
the
example
and
of
those
who
in
this
way
beat
out
a
footpath
such
as
these
gentlemen
have
just
been
complaining
about
which
are
the
real
offenders
the
workers
or
the
people
who
are
simply
amusing
themselves
both
the
rich
and
the
poor
give
us
a
great
deal
of
trouble
these
days
faith
like
power
ought
always
to
descend
from
the
heights
above
us
in
heaven
or
on
earth
and
certainly
in
our
times
the
upper
classes
have
less
faith
in
them
than
the
mass
of
the
people
who
have
god
s
promise
of
heaven
hereafter
as
a
reward
for
evils
patiently
endured
with
due
submission
to
ecclesiastical
discipline
and
deference
to
the
views
of
my
superiors
i
think
that
for
some
time
to
come
we
should
be
less
exacting
as
to
questions
of
doctrine
and
rather
endeavor
to
revive
the
sentiment
of
religion
in
the
hearts
of
the
intermediary
classes
who
debate
over
the
maxims
of
christianity
instead
of
putting
them
in
practice
the
philosophism
of
the
rich
has
set
a
fatal
example
to
the
poor
and
has
brought
about
intervals
of
too
long
duration
when
men
have
faltered
in
their
allegiance
to
god
such
ascendency
as
we
have
over
our
flocks
depends
entirely
on
our
personal
influence
with
them
is
it
not
deplorable
that
the
existence
of
religious
belief
in
a
commune
should
be
dependent
on
the
esteem
in
which
a
single
man
is
held
when
the
preservative
force
of
christianity
permeating
all
classes
of
society
shall
have
put
life
into
the
new
order
of
things
there
will
be
an
end
of
sterile
disputes
about
doctrine
the
cult
of
a
religion
is
its
form
societies
only
exist
by
forms
you
have
your
standard
we
have
the
cross
i
should
very
much
like
to
know
sir
said
genestas
breaking
in
upon
janvier
why
you
forbid
these
poor
folk
to
dance
on
sunday
we
do
not
quarrel
with
dancing
in
itself
captain
it
is
forbidden
because
it
leads
to
immorality
which
troubles
the
peace
of
the
countryside
and
corrupts
its
manners
does
not
the
attempt
to
purify
the
spirit
of
the
family
and
to
maintain
the
sanctity
of
family
ties
strike
at
the
root
of
the
evil
some
irregularities
are
always
to
be
found
in
every
district
i
know
said
tonnelet
but
they
very
seldom
occur
among
us
perhaps
there
are
peasants
who
remove
their
neighbor
s
landmark
without
much
scruple
or
they
may
cut
a
few
osiers
that
belong
to
some
one
else
if
they
happen
to
want
some
but
these
are
mere
peccadilloes
compared
with
the
wrongdoing
that
goes
on
among
a
town
population
moreover
the
people
in
this
valley
seem
to
me
to
be
devoutly
devout
queried
the
cure
with
a
smile
there
is
no
fear
of
fanaticism
but
objected
cambon
if
the
people
all
went
to
mass
every
morning
sir
and
to
confession
every
week
how
would
the
fields
be
cultivated
and
three
priests
would
hardly
be
work
is
prayer
said
the
cure
doing
one
s
duty
brings
a
knowledge
of
the
religious
principles
which
are
a
vital
necessity
to
how
about
patriotism
asked
genestas
patriotism
can
only
inspire
a
enthusiasm
the
curate
answered
gravely
religion
gives
it
permanence
patriotism
consists
in
a
brief
impulse
of
forgetfulness
of
self
and
while
christianity
is
a
complete
system
of
opposition
to
the
depraved
tendencies
of
and
yet
during
the
wars
undertaken
by
the
revolution
patriotism
yes
we
worked
wonders
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
said
benassis
interrupting
genestas
but
only
twenty
years
later
in
our
patriotism
was
extinct
while
in
former
times
a
religious
impulse
moved
france
and
europe
to
fling
themselves
upon
asia
a
dozen
times
in
the
course
of
a
maybe
it
is
easier
for
two
nations
to
come
to
terms
when
the
strife
has
arisen
out
of
some
question
of
material
interests
said
the
justice
of
the
peace
while
wars
undertaken
with
the
idea
of
supporting
dogmas
are
bound
to
be
interminable
because
the
object
can
never
be
clearly
well
sir
you
are
not
helping
any
one
to
fish
put
in
jacquotte
who
had
removed
the
soup
with
nicolle
s
assistance
faithful
to
her
custom
jacquotte
herself
always
brought
in
every
dish
one
after
another
a
plan
which
had
its
drawbacks
for
it
compelled
gluttonous
folk
to
themselves
and
the
more
abstemious
having
satisfied
their
hunger
at
an
early
stage
were
obliged
to
leave
the
best
part
of
the
dinner
untouched
gentlemen
said
the
cure
with
a
glance
at
the
justice
of
the
peace
how
can
you
allege
that
religious
wars
have
had
no
definite
aim
religion
in
olden
times
was
such
a
powerful
binding
force
that
material
interests
and
religious
questions
were
inseparable
every
soldier
therefore
knew
quite
well
what
he
was
fighting
if
there
has
been
so
much
fighting
about
religion
said
genestas
god
must
have
built
up
the
system
very
perfunctorily
should
not
a
divine
institution
impress
men
at
once
by
the
truth
that
is
in
it
all
the
guests
looked
at
the
cure
gentlemen
said
janvier
religion
is
something
that
is
felt
and
that
can
not
be
defined
we
can
not
know
the
purpose
of
the
almighty
we
are
no
judges
of
the
means
he
then
according
to
you
we
are
to
believe
in
all
your
rigmaroles
said
genestas
with
the
easy
of
a
soldier
who
has
never
given
a
thought
to
these
things
the
catholic
religion
better
than
any
other
resolves
men
s
doubts
and
fears
but
even
were
it
otherwise
i
might
ask
you
if
you
run
any
risks
by
believing
in
its
none
worth
speaking
of
answered
genestas
good
and
what
risks
do
you
not
run
by
not
believing
but
let
us
talk
of
the
worldly
aspect
of
the
matter
which
most
appeals
to
you
the
finger
of
god
is
visible
in
human
affairs
see
how
he
directs
them
by
the
hand
of
his
vicar
on
earth
how
much
men
have
lost
by
leaving
the
path
traced
out
for
them
by
christianity
so
few
think
of
reading
church
history
that
erroneous
notions
deliberately
sown
among
the
people
lead
them
to
condemn
the
church
yet
the
church
has
been
a
pattern
of
perfect
government
such
as
men
seek
to
establish
the
principle
of
election
made
it
for
a
long
while
the
great
political
power
except
the
catholic
church
there
was
no
single
religious
institution
which
was
founded
upon
liberty
and
equality
everything
was
ordered
to
this
end
the
the
abbot
the
bishop
the
general
of
an
order
and
the
pope
were
then
chosen
conscientiously
for
their
fitness
for
the
requirements
of
the
church
they
were
the
expression
of
its
intelligence
of
the
thinking
power
of
the
church
and
blind
obedience
was
therefore
their
due
i
will
say
nothing
of
the
ways
in
which
society
has
benefited
by
that
power
which
has
created
modern
nations
and
has
inspired
so
many
poems
so
much
music
so
many
cathedrals
statues
and
pictures
i
will
simply
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
your
modern
systems
of
popular
election
of
two
chambers
and
of
juries
all
had
their
origin
in
provincial
and
oecumenical
councils
and
in
the
episcopate
and
college
of
cardinals
but
there
is
this
difference
the
views
of
civilization
held
by
our
philosophy
seem
to
me
to
fade
away
before
the
sublime
and
divine
conception
of
catholic
communion
the
type
of
a
universal
social
communion
brought
about
by
the
word
and
the
fact
that
are
combined
in
religious
dogma
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
any
modern
political
system
however
perfect
people
may
think
it
to
work
once
more
such
miracles
as
were
wrought
in
those
ages
when
the
church
as
the
stay
and
support
of
the
human
why
asked
genestas
because
in
the
first
place
if
the
principle
of
election
is
to
be
the
basis
of
a
system
absolute
equality
among
the
electors
is
a
first
requirement
they
ought
to
be
equal
quantities
things
which
modern
politics
will
never
bring
about
then
great
social
changes
can
only
be
effected
by
means
of
some
common
sentiment
so
powerful
that
it
brings
men
into
concerted
action
while
philosophism
has
discovered
that
law
is
based
upon
personal
interest
which
keeps
men
apart
men
full
of
the
generous
spirit
that
watches
with
tender
care
over
the
trampled
rights
of
the
suffering
poor
were
more
often
found
among
the
nations
of
past
ages
than
in
our
generation
the
priesthood
also
which
sprang
from
the
middle
classes
resisted
material
forces
and
stood
between
the
people
and
their
enemies
but
the
territorial
possessions
of
the
church
and
her
temporal
power
which
seemingly
made
her
position
yet
stronger
ended
by
crippling
and
weakening
her
action
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
the
priest
has
possessions
and
privileges
he
at
once
appears
in
the
light
of
an
oppressor
he
is
paid
by
the
state
therefore
he
is
an
official
if
he
gives
his
time
his
life
his
whole
heart
this
is
a
matter
of
course
and
nothing
more
than
he
ought
to
do
the
citizens
expect
and
demand
his
devotion
and
the
spontaneous
kindliness
of
his
nature
is
dried
up
but
let
the
priest
be
vowed
to
poverty
let
him
turn
to
his
calling
of
his
own
free
will
let
him
stay
himself
on
god
alone
and
have
no
resource
on
earth
but
the
hearts
of
the
faithful
and
he
becomes
once
more
the
missionary
of
america
he
takes
the
rank
of
an
apostle
he
has
all
things
under
his
feet
indeed
the
burden
of
wealth
drags
him
down
and
it
is
only
by
renouncing
everything
that
he
gains
dominion
over
all
men
s
janvier
had
compelled
the
attention
of
every
one
present
no
one
spoke
for
all
the
guests
were
thoughtful
it
was
something
new
to
hear
such
words
as
these
in
the
mouth
of
a
simple
cure
there
is
one
serious
error
janvier
among
the
truths
to
which
you
have
given
expression
said
benassis
as
you
know
i
do
not
like
to
raise
discussions
on
points
of
general
interest
which
modern
authorities
and
modern
writers
have
called
in
question
in
my
opinion
a
man
who
has
thought
out
a
political
system
and
who
is
conscious
that
he
has
within
him
the
power
of
applying
it
in
practical
politics
should
keep
his
mind
to
himself
seize
his
opportunity
and
act
but
if
he
dwells
in
peaceful
obscurity
as
a
simple
citizen
is
it
not
sheer
lunacy
to
think
to
bring
the
great
mass
over
to
his
opinion
by
means
of
individual
discussions
for
all
that
i
am
about
to
argue
with
you
my
dear
pastor
for
i
am
speaking
before
sensible
men
each
of
whom
is
accustomed
always
to
bring
his
individual
light
to
a
common
search
for
the
truth
my
ideas
may
seem
strange
to
you
but
they
are
the
outcome
of
much
thought
caused
by
the
calamities
of
the
last
forty
years
universal
suffrage
which
finds
such
favor
in
the
sight
of
those
persons
who
belong
to
the
constitutional
opposition
as
it
is
called
was
a
capital
institution
in
the
church
because
as
you
yourself
have
just
pointed
out
dear
pastor
the
individuals
of
whom
the
church
was
composed
were
all
well
educated
disciplined
by
religious
feeling
thoroughly
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
the
same
system
well
aware
of
what
they
wanted
and
whither
they
were
going
but
modern
liberalism
rashly
made
war
upon
the
prosperous
government
of
the
bourbons
by
means
of
ideas
which
should
they
triumph
would
be
the
ruin
of
france
and
of
the
liberals
themselves
this
is
well
known
to
the
leaders
of
the
left
who
are
merely
endeavoring
to
get
the
power
into
their
own
hands
if
which
heaven
forbid
the
middle
classes
ranged
under
the
banner
of
the
opposition
should
succeed
in
overthrowing
those
social
superiorities
which
are
so
repugnant
to
their
vanity
another
struggle
would
follow
hard
upon
their
victory
it
would
not
be
very
long
before
the
middle
classes
in
their
turn
would
be
looked
upon
by
the
people
as
a
sort
of
they
would
be
a
sorry
kind
of
it
is
true
but
their
wealth
and
privileges
would
seem
so
much
the
more
hateful
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
because
they
would
have
a
closer
vision
of
these
things
i
do
not
say
that
the
nation
would
come
to
grief
in
the
struggle
but
society
would
perish
anew
for
the
day
of
triumph
of
a
suffering
people
is
always
brief
and
involves
disorders
of
the
worst
kind
there
would
be
no
truce
in
a
desperate
strife
arising
out
of
an
inherent
or
acquired
difference
of
opinion
among
the
electors
the
less
enlightened
and
more
numerous
portion
would
sweep
away
social
inequalities
thanks
to
a
system
in
which
votes
are
reckoned
by
count
and
not
by
weight
hence
it
follows
that
a
government
is
never
more
strongly
organized
and
as
a
consequence
is
never
more
perfect
than
when
it
has
been
established
for
the
protection
of
privilege
of
the
most
restricted
kind
by
privilege
i
do
not
at
this
moment
mean
the
old
abuses
by
which
certain
rights
were
conceded
to
a
few
to
the
prejudice
of
the
many
no
i
am
using
it
to
express
the
social
circle
of
the
governing
class
but
throughout
creation
nature
has
confined
the
vital
principle
within
a
narrow
space
in
order
to
concentrate
its
power
and
so
it
is
with
the
body
politic
i
will
illustrate
this
thought
of
mine
by
examples
let
us
suppose
that
there
are
a
hundred
peers
in
france
there
are
only
one
hundred
causes
of
offence
abolish
the
peerage
and
all
the
wealthy
people
will
constitute
the
privileged
class
instead
of
a
hundred
you
will
have
ten
thousand
instead
of
removing
class
distinctions
you
have
merely
widened
the
mischief
in
fact
from
the
people
s
point
of
view
the
right
to
live
without
working
is
in
itself
a
privilege
the
unproductive
consumer
is
a
robber
in
their
eyes
the
only
work
that
they
understand
has
palpable
results
they
set
no
value
on
intellectual
labor
the
kind
of
labor
which
is
the
principal
source
of
wealth
to
them
so
by
multiplying
causes
of
offence
in
this
way
you
extend
the
field
of
battle
the
social
war
would
be
waged
on
all
points
instead
of
being
confined
within
a
limited
circle
and
when
attack
and
resistance
become
general
the
ruin
of
a
country
is
imminent
because
the
rich
will
always
be
fewer
in
number
the
victory
will
be
to
the
poor
as
soon
as
it
comes
to
actual
fighting
i
will
throw
the
burden
of
proof
on
history
the
institution
of
senatorial
privilege
enabled
the
roman
republic
to
conquer
the
world
the
senate
preserved
the
tradition
of
authority
but
when
the
and
the
had
extended
the
governing
classes
by
adding
to
the
numbers
of
the
patricians
the
state
came
to
ruin
in
spite
of
sylla
and
after
the
time
of
julius
caesar
tiberius
raised
it
into
the
roman
empire
the
system
was
embodied
in
one
man
and
all
authority
was
centered
in
him
a
measure
which
prolonged
the
magnificent
sway
of
the
roman
for
several
centuries
the
emperor
had
ceased
to
dwell
in
rome
when
the
eternal
city
fell
into
the
hands
of
barbarians
when
the
conqueror
invaded
our
country
the
franks
who
divided
the
land
among
themselves
invented
feudal
privilege
as
a
safeguard
for
property
the
hundred
or
the
thousand
chiefs
who
owned
the
country
established
their
institutions
with
a
view
to
defending
the
rights
gained
by
conquest
the
duration
of
the
feudal
system
was
with
the
restriction
of
privilege
but
when
the
an
exact
translation
of
the
word
from
five
hundred
became
fifty
thousand
there
came
a
revolution
the
governing
power
was
too
widely
diffused
it
lacked
force
and
concentration
and
they
had
not
reckoned
with
the
two
powers
money
and
thought
that
had
set
those
free
who
had
been
beneath
their
rule
so
the
victory
over
the
monarchical
system
obtained
by
the
middle
classes
with
a
view
to
extending
the
number
of
the
privileged
class
will
produce
its
natural
effect
the
people
will
triumph
in
turn
over
the
middle
classes
if
this
trouble
comes
to
pass
the
indiscriminate
right
of
suffrage
bestowed
upon
the
masses
will
be
a
dangerous
weapon
in
their
hands
the
man
who
votes
criticises
an
authority
that
is
called
in
question
is
no
longer
an
authority
can
you
imagine
a
society
without
a
governing
authority
no
you
can
not
therefore
authority
means
force
and
a
basis
of
just
judgement
should
underlie
force
such
are
the
reasons
which
have
led
me
to
think
that
the
principle
of
popular
election
is
a
most
fatal
one
for
modern
governments
i
think
that
my
attachment
to
the
poor
and
suffering
classes
has
been
sufficiently
proved
and
that
no
one
will
accuse
me
of
bearing
any
towards
them
but
though
i
admire
the
sublime
patience
and
resignation
with
which
they
tread
the
path
of
toil
i
must
pronounce
them
to
be
unfit
to
take
part
in
the
government
the
proletariat
seem
to
me
to
be
the
minors
of
a
nation
and
ought
to
remain
in
a
condition
of
tutelage
therefore
gentlemen
the
word
to
my
thinking
is
in
a
fair
way
to
cause
as
much
mischief
as
the
words
and
which
and
were
flung
broadcast
among
the
people
to
serve
as
watchwords
of
revolt
and
incitements
to
destruction
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
right
and
necessary
thing
that
the
masses
should
be
kept
in
tutelage
for
the
good
of
this
system
of
yours
runs
so
clean
contrary
to
everybody
s
notions
nowadays
that
we
have
some
right
to
ask
your
reasons
for
it
said
genestas
interrupting
the
doctor
by
all
means
what
is
this
the
master
is
saying
cried
jacquotte
as
she
went
back
to
her
kitchen
there
he
is
the
poor
dear
man
and
what
is
he
doing
but
advising
them
to
crush
the
people
and
they
are
listening
to
him
i
would
never
have
believed
it
of
benassis
answered
nicolle
if
i
require
that
the
ignorant
masses
should
be
governed
by
a
strong
hand
the
doctor
resumed
after
a
brief
pause
i
should
desire
at
the
same
time
that
the
framework
of
the
social
system
should
be
sufficiently
yielding
and
elastic
to
allow
those
who
have
the
will
and
are
conscious
of
their
ability
to
emerge
from
the
crowd
to
rise
and
take
their
place
among
the
privileged
classes
the
aim
of
power
of
every
kind
is
its
own
preservation
in
order
to
live
a
government
as
in
the
past
must
press
the
strong
men
of
the
nation
into
its
service
taking
them
from
every
quarter
so
as
to
make
them
its
defenders
and
to
remove
from
among
the
people
the
men
of
energy
who
incite
the
masses
to
insurrection
by
opening
out
in
this
way
to
the
public
ambition
paths
that
are
at
once
difficult
and
easy
easy
for
strong
wills
difficult
for
weak
or
imperfect
ones
a
state
averts
the
perils
of
the
revolutions
caused
by
the
struggles
of
men
of
superior
powers
to
rise
to
their
proper
level
our
long
agony
of
forty
years
should
have
made
it
clear
to
any
man
who
has
brains
that
social
superiorities
are
a
natural
outcome
of
the
order
of
things
they
are
of
three
kinds
that
can
not
be
questioned
the
superiority
of
the
thinker
the
superiority
of
the
politician
the
superiority
of
wealth
is
not
that
as
much
as
to
say
genius
power
and
money
or
in
yet
other
words
the
cause
the
means
and
the
effect
but
suppose
a
kind
of
social
every
social
unit
perfectly
equal
an
increase
of
population
everywhere
in
the
same
ratio
and
give
the
same
amount
of
land
to
each
family
it
would
not
be
long
before
you
would
again
have
all
the
existing
inequalities
of
fortune
it
is
glaringly
evident
therefore
that
there
are
such
things
as
superiority
of
fortune
of
thinking
capacity
and
of
power
and
we
must
make
up
our
minds
to
this
fact
but
the
masses
will
always
regard
rights
that
have
been
most
honestly
acquired
as
privileges
and
as
a
wrong
done
to
themselves
the
founded
upon
this
basis
will
be
a
perpetual
pact
between
those
who
have
and
those
who
have
not
and
acting
on
these
principles
those
who
benefit
by
the
laws
will
be
the
lawmakers
for
they
necessarily
have
the
instinct
of
and
foresee
their
dangers
it
is
even
more
to
their
interest
than
to
the
interest
of
the
masses
themselves
that
the
latter
should
be
quiet
and
contented
the
happiness
of
the
people
should
be
ready
made
for
the
people
if
you
look
at
society
as
a
whole
from
this
point
of
view
you
will
soon
see
as
i
do
that
the
privilege
of
election
ought
only
to
be
exercised
by
men
who
possess
wealth
power
or
intelligence
and
you
will
likewise
see
that
the
action
of
the
deputies
they
may
choose
to
represent
them
should
be
considerably
restricted
the
maker
of
laws
gentlemen
should
be
in
advance
of
his
age
it
is
his
business
to
ascertain
the
tendency
of
erroneous
notions
popularly
held
to
see
the
exact
direction
in
which
the
ideas
of
a
nation
are
tending
he
labors
for
the
future
rather
than
for
the
present
and
for
the
rising
generation
rather
than
for
the
one
that
is
passing
away
but
if
you
call
in
the
masses
to
make
the
laws
can
they
rise
above
their
own
level
nay
the
more
faithfully
an
assembly
represents
the
opinions
held
by
the
crowd
the
less
it
will
know
about
government
the
less
lofty
its
ideas
will
be
and
the
more
vague
and
vacillating
its
policy
for
the
crowd
is
and
always
will
be
simply
a
crowd
and
this
especially
with
us
in
france
law
involves
submission
to
regulations
man
is
naturally
opposed
to
rules
and
regulations
of
all
kinds
especially
if
they
interfere
with
his
interests
so
is
it
likely
that
the
masses
will
enact
laws
that
are
contrary
to
their
own
inclinations
no
very
often
legislation
ought
to
run
counter
to
the
prevailing
tendencies
of
the
time
if
the
law
is
to
be
shaped
by
the
prevailing
habits
of
thought
and
tendencies
of
a
nation
would
not
that
mean
that
in
spain
a
direct
encouragement
would
be
given
to
idleness
and
religious
intolerance
in
england
to
the
commercial
spirit
in
italy
to
the
love
of
the
arts
that
may
be
the
expression
of
a
society
but
by
which
no
society
can
entirely
exist
in
germany
feudal
class
distinctions
would
be
fostered
and
here
in
france
popular
legislation
would
promote
the
spirit
of
frivolity
the
sudden
craze
for
an
idea
and
the
readiness
to
split
into
factions
which
has
always
been
our
bane
what
has
happened
in
the
forty
years
since
the
electors
took
it
upon
themselves
to
make
laws
for
france
we
have
something
like
forty
thousand
laws
a
people
with
forty
thousand
laws
might
as
well
have
none
at
all
is
it
likely
that
five
hundred
mediocrities
for
there
are
never
more
than
a
hundred
great
minds
to
do
the
work
of
any
one
century
is
it
likely
that
five
hundred
mediocrities
will
have
the
wit
to
rise
to
the
level
of
these
considerations
not
they
here
is
a
constant
stream
of
men
poured
forth
from
five
hundred
different
places
they
will
interpret
the
spirit
of
the
law
in
divers
manners
and
there
should
be
a
unity
of
conception
in
the
law
but
i
will
go
yet
further
sooner
or
later
an
assembly
of
this
kind
comes
to
be
swayed
by
one
man
and
instead
of
a
dynasty
of
kings
you
have
a
constantly
changing
and
costly
succession
of
prime
ministers
there
comes
a
mirabeau
or
a
danton
a
robespierre
or
a
napoleon
or
proconsuls
or
an
emperor
and
there
is
an
end
of
deliberations
and
debates
in
fact
it
takes
a
determinate
amount
of
force
to
raise
a
given
weight
the
force
may
be
distributed
and
you
may
have
a
less
or
greater
number
of
levers
but
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
in
the
end
the
force
must
be
in
proportion
to
the
weight
the
weight
in
this
case
is
the
ignorant
and
suffering
mass
of
people
who
form
the
lowest
stratum
of
society
the
attitude
of
authority
is
bound
to
be
repressive
and
great
concentration
of
the
governing
power
is
needed
to
neutralize
the
force
of
a
popular
movement
this
is
the
application
of
the
principle
that
i
unfolded
when
i
spoke
just
now
of
the
way
in
which
the
class
privileged
to
govern
should
be
restricted
if
this
class
is
composed
of
men
of
ability
they
will
obey
this
natural
law
and
compel
the
country
to
obey
if
you
collect
a
crowd
of
mediocrities
together
sooner
or
later
they
will
fall
under
the
dominion
of
a
stronger
head
a
deputy
of
talent
understands
the
reasons
for
which
a
government
exists
the
mediocre
deputy
simply
comes
to
terms
with
force
an
assembly
either
obeys
an
idea
like
the
convention
in
the
time
of
the
terror
a
powerful
personality
like
the
corps
legislatif
under
the
rule
of
napoleon
or
falls
under
the
domination
of
a
system
or
of
wealth
as
it
has
done
in
our
own
day
the
republican
assembly
that
dream
of
some
innocent
souls
is
an
impossibility
those
who
would
fain
bring
it
to
pass
are
either
grossly
deluded
dupes
or
tyrants
do
you
not
think
that
there
is
something
ludicrous
about
an
assembly
which
gravely
sits
in
debate
upon
the
perils
of
a
nation
which
ought
to
be
roused
into
immediate
action
it
is
only
right
of
course
that
the
people
should
elect
a
body
of
representatives
who
will
decide
questions
of
supplies
and
of
taxation
this
institution
has
always
existed
under
the
sway
of
the
most
tyrannous
ruler
no
less
than
under
the
sceptre
of
the
mildest
of
princes
money
is
not
to
be
taken
by
force
there
are
natural
limits
to
taxation
and
if
they
are
overstepped
a
nation
either
rises
up
in
revolt
or
lays
itself
down
to
die
again
if
this
elective
body
changing
from
time
to
time
according
to
the
needs
and
ideas
of
those
whom
it
represents
should
refuse
obedience
to
a
bad
law
in
the
name
of
the
people
well
and
good
but
to
imagine
that
five
hundred
men
drawn
from
every
corner
of
the
kingdom
will
make
a
good
law
is
it
not
a
dreary
joke
for
which
the
people
will
sooner
or
later
have
to
pay
they
have
a
change
of
masters
that
is
all
authority
ought
to
be
given
to
one
man
he
alone
should
have
the
task
of
making
the
laws
and
he
should
be
a
man
who
by
force
of
circumstances
is
continually
obliged
to
submit
his
actions
to
general
approbation
but
the
only
restraints
that
can
be
brought
to
bear
upon
the
exercise
of
power
be
it
the
power
of
the
one
of
the
many
or
of
the
multitude
are
to
be
found
in
the
religious
institutions
of
a
country
religion
forms
the
only
adequate
safeguard
against
the
abuse
of
supreme
power
when
a
nation
ceases
to
believe
in
religion
it
becomes
ungovernable
in
consequence
and
its
prince
perforce
becomes
a
tyrant
the
chambers
that
occupy
an
intermediate
place
between
rulers
and
their
subjects
are
powerless
to
prevent
these
results
and
can
only
mitigate
them
to
a
very
slight
extent
assemblies
as
i
have
said
before
are
bound
to
become
the
accomplices
of
tyranny
on
the
one
hand
or
of
insurrection
on
the
other
my
own
leanings
are
towards
a
government
by
one
man
but
though
it
is
good
it
can
not
be
absolutely
good
for
the
results
of
every
policy
will
always
depend
upon
the
condition
and
the
belief
of
the
nation
if
a
nation
is
in
its
dotage
if
it
has
been
corrupted
to
the
core
by
philosophism
and
the
spirit
of
discussion
it
is
on
the
to
despotism
from
which
no
form
of
free
government
will
save
it
and
at
the
same
time
a
righteous
people
will
nearly
always
find
liberty
even
under
a
despotic
rule
all
this
goes
to
show
the
necessity
for
restricting
the
right
of
election
within
very
narrow
limits
the
necessity
for
a
strong
government
the
necessity
for
a
powerful
religion
which
makes
the
rich
man
the
friend
of
the
poor
and
enjoins
upon
the
poor
an
absolute
submission
to
their
lot
it
is
in
fact
really
imperative
that
the
assemblies
should
be
deprived
of
all
direct
legislative
power
and
should
confine
themselves
to
the
registration
of
laws
and
to
questions
of
taxation
i
know
that
different
ideas
from
these
exist
in
many
minds
as
in
past
ages
there
ware
enthusiasts
who
seek
for
perfection
and
who
would
like
to
have
society
better
ordered
than
it
is
at
present
but
innovations
which
tend
to
bring
about
a
kind
of
social
ought
only
to
be
undertaken
by
general
consent
let
the
innovators
have
patience
when
i
remember
how
long
it
has
taken
christianity
to
establish
itself
how
many
centuries
it
has
taken
to
bring
about
a
purely
moral
revolution
which
surely
ought
to
have
been
accomplished
peacefully
the
thought
of
the
horrors
of
a
revolution
in
which
material
interests
are
concerned
makes
me
shudder
and
i
am
for
maintaining
existing
institutions
each
shall
have
his
own
thought
is
the
dictum
of
christianity
each
man
shall
have
his
own
field
says
modern
law
and
in
this
modern
law
is
in
harmony
with
christianity
each
shall
have
his
own
thought
that
is
a
consecration
of
the
rights
of
intelligence
and
each
shall
have
his
own
field
is
a
consecration
of
the
right
to
property
that
has
been
acquired
by
toil
hence
our
society
nature
has
based
human
life
upon
the
instinct
of
and
social
life
is
founded
upon
personal
interest
such
ideas
as
these
are
to
my
thinking
the
very
rudiments
of
politics
religion
keeps
these
two
selfish
sentiments
in
subordination
by
the
thought
of
a
future
life
and
in
this
way
the
harshness
of
the
conflict
of
interests
has
been
somewhat
softened
god
has
mitigated
the
sufferings
that
arise
from
social
friction
by
a
religious
sentiment
which
raises
into
a
virtue
just
as
he
has
moderated
the
friction
of
the
mechanism
of
the
universe
by
laws
which
we
do
not
know
christianity
bids
the
poor
bear
patiently
with
the
rich
and
commands
the
rich
to
lighten
the
burdens
of
the
poor
these
few
words
to
my
mind
contain
the
essence
of
all
laws
human
and
divine
i
am
no
statesman
said
the
notary
i
see
in
a
ruler
a
liquidator
of
society
which
should
always
remain
in
liquidation
he
should
hand
over
to
his
successor
the
exact
value
of
the
assets
which
he
i
am
no
statesman
either
said
benassis
hastily
interrupting
the
notary
it
takes
nothing
but
a
little
common
sense
to
better
the
lot
of
a
commune
of
a
canton
or
of
an
even
wider
district
a
department
calls
for
some
administrative
talent
but
all
these
four
spheres
of
action
are
comparatively
limited
the
outlook
is
not
too
wide
for
ordinary
powers
of
vision
and
there
is
a
visible
connection
between
their
interests
and
the
general
progress
made
by
the
state
but
in
yet
higher
regions
everything
is
on
a
larger
scale
the
horizon
widens
and
from
the
standpoint
where
he
is
placed
the
statesman
ought
to
grasp
the
whole
situation
it
is
only
necessary
to
consider
liabilities
due
ten
years
hence
in
order
to
bring
about
a
great
deal
of
good
in
the
case
of
the
department
the
district
the
canton
or
the
commune
but
when
it
is
a
question
of
the
destinies
of
a
nation
a
statesman
must
foresee
a
more
distant
future
and
the
course
that
events
are
likely
to
take
for
the
next
hundred
years
the
genius
of
a
colbert
or
of
a
sully
avails
nothing
unless
it
is
supported
by
the
energetic
will
that
makes
a
napoleon
or
a
cromwell
a
great
minister
gentlemen
is
a
great
thought
written
at
large
over
all
the
years
of
a
century
of
prosperity
and
splendor
for
which
he
has
prepared
the
way
steadfast
perseverance
is
the
virtue
of
which
he
stands
most
in
need
and
in
all
human
affairs
does
not
steadfast
perseverance
indicate
a
power
of
the
very
highest
order
we
have
had
for
some
time
past
too
many
men
who
think
only
of
the
ministry
instead
of
the
nation
so
that
we
can
not
but
admire
the
real
statesman
as
the
vastest
human
poetry
ever
to
look
beyond
the
present
moment
to
foresee
the
ways
of
destiny
to
care
so
little
for
power
that
he
only
retains
it
because
he
is
conscious
of
his
usefulness
while
he
does
not
overestimate
his
strength
ever
to
lay
aside
all
personal
feeling
and
low
ambitions
so
that
he
may
always
be
master
of
his
faculties
and
foresee
will
and
act
without
ceasing
to
compel
himself
to
be
just
and
impartial
to
keep
order
on
a
large
scale
to
silence
his
heart
that
he
may
be
guided
by
his
intellect
alone
to
be
neither
apprehensive
nor
sanguine
neither
suspicious
nor
confiding
neither
grateful
nor
ungrateful
never
to
be
unprepared
for
an
event
nor
taken
unawares
by
an
idea
to
live
in
fact
with
the
requirements
of
the
masses
ever
in
his
mind
to
spread
the
protecting
wings
of
his
thought
above
them
to
sway
them
by
the
thunder
of
his
voice
and
the
keenness
of
his
glance
seeing
all
the
while
not
the
details
of
affairs
but
the
great
issues
at
stake
is
not
that
to
be
something
more
than
a
mere
man
therefore
the
names
of
the
great
and
noble
fathers
of
nations
can
not
but
be
household
words
for
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
during
which
the
guests
looked
at
one
another
gentlemen
you
have
not
said
a
word
about
the
army
cried
genestas
a
military
organization
seems
to
me
to
be
the
real
type
on
which
all
good
civil
society
should
be
modeled
the
sword
is
the
guardian
of
a
the
justice
of
the
peace
laughed
softly
captain
he
said
an
old
lawyer
once
said
that
empires
began
with
the
sword
and
ended
with
the
desk
we
have
reached
the
desk
stage
by
this
and
now
that
we
have
settled
the
fate
of
the
world
gentlemen
let
us
change
the
subject
come
captain
a
glass
of
hermitage
cried
the
doctor
laughing
two
rather
than
one
said
genestas
holding
out
his
glass
i
mean
to
drink
them
both
to
your
health
to
a
man
who
does
honor
to
the
and
who
is
dear
to
all
of
us
said
the
cure
in
gentle
tones
do
you
mean
to
force
me
into
the
sin
of
pride
janvier
m
le
cure
has
only
said
in
a
low
voice
what
all
the
canton
says
aloud
said
cambon
gentlemen
i
propose
that
we
take
a
walk
to
the
parsonage
by
moonlight
and
see
janvier
let
us
start
said
the
guests
and
they
prepared
to
accompany
the
cure
shall
we
go
to
the
barn
said
the
doctor
laying
a
hand
on
genestas
arm
they
had
taken
leave
of
the
cure
and
the
other
guests
you
will
hear
them
talking
about
napoleon
captain
bluteau
goguelat
the
postman
is
there
and
there
are
several
of
his
cronies
who
are
sure
to
draw
him
out
on
the
subject
of
the
idol
of
the
people
nicolle
my
stableman
has
set
a
ladder
so
that
we
can
climb
up
on
to
the
hay
there
is
a
place
from
which
we
can
look
down
on
the
whole
scene
come
along
an
is
something
worth
seeing
believe
me
it
will
not
be
the
first
time
that
i
have
hidden
in
the
hay
to
overhear
a
soldier
s
tales
or
the
stories
that
peasants
tell
among
themselves
we
must
be
careful
to
keep
out
of
sight
though
as
these
folk
turn
shy
and
put
on
company
manners
as
soon
as
they
see
a
eh
my
dear
sir
said
genestas
have
i
not
often
pretended
to
be
asleep
so
as
to
hear
my
troopers
talking
out
on
bivouac
my
word
i
once
heard
a
droll
yarn
reeled
off
by
an
old
quartermaster
for
some
conscripts
who
were
afraid
of
war
i
never
laughed
so
heartily
in
any
theatre
in
paris
he
was
telling
them
about
the
retreat
from
moscow
he
told
them
that
the
army
had
nothing
but
the
clothes
they
stood
up
in
that
their
wine
was
iced
that
the
dead
stood
in
the
road
just
where
they
were
that
they
had
seen
white
russia
and
that
they
currycombed
the
horses
there
with
their
teeth
that
those
who
were
fond
of
skating
had
fine
times
of
it
and
people
who
had
a
fancy
for
savory
ices
had
as
much
as
they
could
put
away
that
the
women
were
generally
poor
company
but
that
the
only
thing
they
could
really
complain
of
was
the
want
of
hot
water
for
shaving
in
fact
he
told
them
such
a
pack
of
absurdities
that
even
an
old
quartermaster
who
had
lost
his
nose
with
a
so
that
they
had
dubbed
him
was
fain
to
hush
said
benassis
here
we
are
i
will
go
first
follow
after
both
of
them
scaled
the
ladder
and
hid
themselves
in
the
hay
in
a
place
from
whence
they
could
have
a
good
view
of
the
party
below
who
had
not
heard
a
sound
overhead
little
groups
of
women
were
clustered
about
three
or
four
candles
some
of
them
sewed
others
were
spinning
a
good
few
of
them
were
doing
nothing
and
sat
with
their
heads
strained
forward
and
their
eyes
fixed
on
an
old
peasant
who
was
telling
a
story
the
men
were
standing
about
for
the
most
part
or
lying
at
full
length
on
the
trusses
of
hay
every
group
was
absolutely
silent
their
faces
were
barely
visible
by
the
flickering
gleams
of
the
candles
by
which
the
women
were
working
although
each
candle
was
surrounded
by
a
glass
globe
filled
with
water
in
order
to
concentrate
the
light
the
thick
darkness
and
shadow
that
filled
the
roof
and
all
the
upper
part
of
the
barn
seemed
still
further
to
diminish
the
light
that
fell
here
and
there
upon
the
workers
heads
with
such
picturesque
effects
of
light
and
shade
here
it
shone
full
upon
the
bright
wondering
eyes
and
brown
forehead
of
a
little
peasant
maiden
and
there
the
straggling
beams
brought
out
the
outlines
of
the
rugged
brows
of
some
of
the
older
men
throwing
up
their
figures
in
sharp
relief
against
the
dark
background
and
giving
a
fantastic
appearance
to
their
worn
and
garb
the
attentive
attitude
of
all
these
people
and
the
expression
on
all
their
faces
showed
that
they
had
given
themselves
up
entirely
to
the
pleasure
of
listening
and
that
the
narrator
s
sway
was
absolute
it
was
a
curious
scene
the
immense
influence
that
poetry
exerts
over
every
mind
was
plainly
to
be
seen
for
is
not
the
peasant
who
demands
that
the
tale
of
wonder
should
be
simple
and
that
the
impossible
should
be
credible
a
lover
of
poetry
of
the
purest
kind
she
did
not
like
the
look
of
the
house
at
all
the
peasant
was
saying
as
the
two
newcomers
took
their
places
where
they
could
overhear
him
but
the
poor
little
hunchback
was
so
tired
out
with
carrying
her
bundle
of
hemp
to
market
that
she
went
in
besides
the
night
had
come
and
she
could
go
no
further
she
only
asked
to
be
allowed
to
sleep
there
and
ate
nothing
but
a
crust
of
bread
that
she
took
from
her
wallet
and
inasmuch
as
the
woman
who
kept
house
for
the
brigands
knew
nothing
about
what
they
had
planned
to
do
that
night
she
let
the
old
woman
into
the
house
and
sent
her
upstairs
without
a
light
our
hunchback
throws
herself
down
on
a
rickety
truckle
bed
says
her
prayers
thinks
about
her
hemp
and
is
dropping
off
to
sleep
but
before
she
is
fairly
asleep
she
hears
a
noise
and
in
walk
two
men
carrying
a
lantern
and
each
man
had
a
knife
in
his
hand
then
fear
came
upon
her
for
in
those
times
look
you
they
used
to
make
pates
of
human
flesh
for
the
seigneurs
who
were
very
fond
of
them
but
the
old
woman
plucked
up
heart
again
for
she
was
so
thoroughly
shriveled
and
wrinkled
that
she
thought
they
would
think
her
a
poorish
sort
of
diet
the
two
men
went
past
the
hunchback
and
walked
up
to
a
bed
that
there
was
in
the
great
room
and
in
which
they
had
put
the
gentleman
with
the
big
portmanteau
the
one
that
passed
for
a
the
taller
man
holds
up
the
lantern
and
takes
the
gentleman
by
the
feet
and
the
short
one
that
had
pretended
to
be
drunk
clutches
hold
of
his
head
and
cuts
his
throat
clean
with
one
stroke
swish
then
they
leave
the
head
and
body
lying
in
its
own
blood
up
there
steal
the
portmanteau
and
go
downstairs
with
it
here
is
our
woman
in
a
nice
fix
first
of
all
she
thinks
of
slipping
out
before
any
one
can
suspect
it
not
knowing
that
providence
had
brought
her
there
to
glorify
god
and
to
bring
down
punishment
on
the
murderers
she
was
in
a
great
fright
and
when
one
is
frightened
one
thinks
of
nothing
else
but
the
woman
of
the
house
had
asked
the
two
brigands
about
the
hunchback
and
that
had
alarmed
them
so
back
they
came
creeping
softly
up
the
wooden
staircase
the
poor
hunchback
curls
up
in
a
ball
with
fright
and
she
hears
them
talking
about
her
in
whispers
kill
her
i
tell
no
need
to
kill
kill
her
no
then
they
came
in
the
woman
who
was
no
fool
shuts
her
eyes
and
pretends
to
be
asleep
she
sets
to
work
to
sleep
like
a
child
with
her
hand
on
her
heart
and
takes
to
breathing
like
a
cherub
the
man
opens
the
lantern
and
shines
the
light
straight
into
the
eyes
of
the
sleeping
old
woman
she
does
not
move
an
eyelash
she
is
in
such
terror
for
her
neck
she
is
sleeping
like
a
log
you
can
see
that
quite
well
so
says
the
tall
one
old
women
are
so
cunning
answers
the
short
man
i
will
kill
her
we
shall
feel
easier
in
our
minds
besides
we
will
salt
her
down
to
feed
the
the
old
woman
hears
all
this
talk
but
she
does
not
stir
oh
it
is
all
right
she
is
asleep
says
the
short
ruffian
when
he
saw
that
the
hunchback
had
not
stirred
that
is
how
the
old
woman
saved
her
life
and
she
may
be
fairly
called
courageous
for
it
is
a
fact
that
there
are
not
many
girls
here
who
could
have
breathed
like
cherubs
while
they
heard
that
talk
going
on
about
the
pigs
well
the
two
brigands
set
to
work
to
lift
up
the
dead
man
they
wrap
him
round
in
the
sheets
and
chuck
him
out
into
the
little
yard
and
the
old
woman
hears
the
pigs
scampering
up
to
eat
him
and
grunting
so
when
morning
comes
the
narrator
resumed
after
a
pause
the
woman
gets
up
and
goes
down
paying
a
couple
of
sous
for
her
bed
she
takes
up
her
wallet
goes
on
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
asks
for
the
news
of
the
countryside
and
gets
away
in
peace
she
wants
to
run
running
is
quite
out
of
the
question
her
legs
fail
her
for
fright
and
lucky
it
was
for
her
that
she
could
not
run
for
this
reason
she
had
barely
gone
half
a
quarter
of
a
league
before
she
sees
one
of
the
brigands
coming
after
her
just
out
of
craftiness
to
make
quite
sure
that
she
had
seen
nothing
she
guesses
this
and
sits
herself
down
on
a
boulder
what
is
the
matter
good
woman
asks
the
short
one
for
it
was
the
shorter
one
and
the
wickeder
of
the
two
who
was
dogging
her
oh
master
says
she
my
wallet
is
so
heavy
and
i
am
so
tired
that
i
badly
want
some
good
man
to
give
me
his
arm
sly
thing
only
listen
to
her
if
i
am
to
get
back
to
my
poor
thereupon
the
brigand
offers
to
go
along
with
her
and
she
accepts
his
offer
the
fellow
takes
hold
of
her
arm
to
see
if
she
is
afraid
not
she
she
does
not
tremble
a
bit
and
walks
quietly
along
so
there
they
are
chatting
away
as
nicely
as
possible
all
about
farming
and
the
way
to
grow
hemp
till
they
come
to
the
outskirts
of
the
town
where
the
hunchback
lived
and
the
brigand
made
off
for
fear
of
meeting
some
of
the
sheriff
s
people
the
woman
reached
her
house
at
and
waited
there
till
her
husband
came
home
she
thought
and
thought
over
all
that
had
happened
on
her
journey
and
during
the
night
the
came
home
in
the
evening
he
was
hungry
something
must
be
got
ready
for
him
to
eat
so
while
she
greases
her
and
gets
ready
to
fry
something
for
him
she
tells
him
how
she
sold
her
hemp
and
gabbles
away
as
females
do
but
not
a
word
does
she
say
about
the
pigs
nor
about
the
gentleman
who
was
murdered
and
robbed
and
eaten
she
holds
her
in
the
flames
so
as
to
clean
it
draws
it
out
again
to
give
it
a
wipe
and
finds
it
full
of
blood
what
have
you
been
putting
into
it
says
she
to
her
man
nothing
says
he
she
thinks
it
must
have
been
a
nonsensical
piece
of
woman
s
fancy
and
puts
her
into
the
fire
again
a
head
comes
tumbling
down
the
chimney
oh
look
it
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
dead
man
s
head
says
the
old
woman
how
he
stares
at
me
what
does
he
want
must
avenge
says
a
voice
what
an
idiot
you
are
said
the
always
seeing
something
or
other
that
has
no
sort
of
sense
about
it
just
you
all
he
takes
up
the
head
which
snaps
at
his
finger
and
pitches
it
out
into
the
yard
get
on
with
my
omelette
he
says
and
do
not
bother
yourself
about
that
tis
a
a
cat
says
she
it
was
as
round
as
a
she
puts
back
her
on
the
fire
down
comes
a
leg
this
time
and
they
go
through
the
whole
story
again
the
man
was
no
more
astonished
at
the
foot
than
he
had
been
at
the
head
he
snatched
up
the
leg
and
threw
it
out
at
the
door
before
they
had
finished
the
other
leg
both
arms
the
body
the
whole
murdered
traveler
in
fact
came
down
piecemeal
no
omelette
all
this
time
the
old
grew
very
hungry
indeed
by
my
salvation
said
he
when
once
my
omelette
is
made
we
will
see
about
satisfying
that
man
so
you
admit
now
that
it
was
a
man
said
the
hunchback
wife
what
made
you
say
that
it
was
not
a
head
a
minute
ago
you
great
worry
the
woman
breaks
the
eggs
fries
the
omelette
and
dishes
it
up
without
any
more
grumbling
somehow
this
squabble
began
to
make
her
feel
very
uncomfortable
her
husband
sits
down
and
begins
to
eat
the
hunchback
was
frightened
and
said
that
she
was
not
hungry
tap
tap
there
was
a
stranger
rapping
at
the
door
who
is
there
the
man
that
died
yesterday
come
in
answers
the
so
the
traveler
comes
in
sits
himself
down
on
a
stool
and
says
are
you
mindful
of
god
who
gives
eternal
peace
to
those
who
confess
his
name
woman
you
saw
me
done
to
death
and
you
have
said
nothing
i
have
been
eaten
by
the
pigs
the
pigs
do
not
enter
paradise
and
therefore
i
a
christian
man
shall
go
down
into
hell
all
because
a
woman
forsooth
will
not
speak
a
thing
that
has
never
been
known
before
you
must
deliver
me
and
so
on
and
so
on
the
woman
who
was
more
and
more
frightened
every
minute
cleaned
her
put
on
her
sunday
clothes
went
to
the
justice
and
told
him
about
the
crime
which
was
brought
to
light
and
the
robbers
were
broken
on
the
wheel
in
proper
style
on
the
market
place
this
good
work
accomplished
the
woman
and
her
husband
always
had
the
finest
hemp
you
ever
set
eyes
on
then
which
pleased
them
still
better
they
had
something
that
they
had
wished
for
for
a
long
time
a
who
in
course
of
time
became
a
great
lord
of
the
king
s
that
is
the
true
story
of
courageous
hunchback
i
do
not
like
stories
of
that
sort
they
make
me
dream
at
night
said
la
fosseuse
napoleon
s
adventures
are
much
nicer
i
quite
true
said
the
keeper
come
now
goguelat
tell
us
about
the
the
evening
is
too
far
gone
said
the
postman
and
i
do
not
care
about
cutting
short
the
story
of
a
never
mind
let
us
hear
about
it
all
the
same
we
know
the
stories
for
we
have
heard
you
tell
them
many
a
time
but
it
is
always
a
pleasure
to
hear
tell
us
about
the
emperor
cried
several
voices
at
once
you
will
have
it
answered
goguelat
very
good
but
you
will
see
that
there
is
no
sense
in
the
story
when
it
is
gone
through
at
a
gallop
i
would
rather
tell
you
all
about
a
single
battle
shall
it
be
where
we
ran
out
of
cartridges
and
furbished
them
just
the
same
with
the
bayonet
no
the
emperor
the
emperor
the
old
infantry
man
got
up
from
his
truss
of
hay
and
glanced
round
about
on
those
assembled
with
the
peculiar
sombre
expression
in
which
may
be
read
all
the
miseries
adventures
and
hardships
of
an
old
soldier
s
career
he
took
his
coat
by
the
two
skirts
in
front
and
raised
them
as
if
it
were
a
question
of
once
more
packing
up
the
knapsack
in
which
his
kit
his
shoes
and
all
he
had
in
the
world
used
to
be
stowed
for
a
moment
he
stood
leaning
all
his
weight
on
his
left
foot
then
he
swung
the
right
foot
forward
and
yielded
with
a
good
grace
to
the
wishes
of
his
audience
he
swept
his
gray
hair
to
one
side
so
as
to
leave
his
forehead
bare
and
flung
back
his
head
and
gazed
upwards
as
if
to
raise
himself
to
the
lofty
height
of
the
gigantic
story
that
he
was
about
to
tell
napoleon
you
see
my
friends
was
born
in
corsica
which
is
a
french
island
warmed
by
the
italian
sun
it
is
like
a
furnace
there
everything
is
scorched
up
and
they
keep
on
killing
each
other
from
father
to
son
for
generations
all
about
nothing
at
all
tis
a
notion
they
have
to
begin
at
the
beginning
there
was
something
extraordinary
about
the
thing
from
the
first
it
occurred
to
his
mother
who
was
the
handsomest
woman
of
her
time
and
a
shrewd
soul
to
dedicate
him
to
god
so
that
he
should
escape
all
the
dangers
of
infancy
and
of
his
after
life
for
she
had
dreamed
that
the
world
was
on
fire
on
the
day
he
was
born
it
was
a
prophecy
so
she
asked
god
to
protect
him
on
condition
that
napoleon
should
his
holy
religion
which
had
been
thrown
to
the
ground
just
then
that
was
the
agreement
we
shall
see
what
came
of
it
now
do
you
follow
me
carefully
and
tell
me
whether
what
you
are
about
to
hear
is
natural
it
is
certain
sure
that
only
a
man
who
had
had
imagination
enough
to
make
a
mysterious
compact
would
be
capable
of
going
further
than
anybody
else
and
of
passing
through
volleys
of
and
showers
of
bullets
which
carried
us
off
like
flies
but
which
had
a
respect
for
his
head
i
myself
had
particular
proof
of
that
at
eylau
i
see
him
yet
he
climbs
a
hillock
takes
his
looks
along
our
lines
and
says
that
is
going
on
all
one
of
the
deep
fellows
with
a
bunch
of
feathers
in
his
cap
used
to
plague
him
a
good
deal
from
all
accounts
following
him
about
everywhere
even
when
he
was
getting
his
meals
this
fellow
wants
to
do
something
clever
so
as
soon
as
the
emperor
goes
away
he
takes
his
place
oh
swept
away
in
a
moment
and
this
is
the
last
of
the
bunch
of
feathers
you
understand
quite
clearly
that
napoleon
had
undertaken
to
keep
his
secret
to
himself
that
is
why
those
who
accompanied
him
and
even
his
especial
friends
used
to
drop
like
nuts
duroc
bessieres
lannes
men
as
strong
as
bars
of
steel
which
he
cast
into
shape
for
his
own
ends
and
here
is
a
final
proof
that
he
was
the
child
of
god
created
to
be
the
soldier
s
father
for
no
one
ever
saw
him
as
a
lieutenant
or
a
captain
he
is
a
commandant
straight
off
ah
yes
indeed
he
did
not
look
more
than
but
he
was
an
old
general
ever
since
the
taking
of
toulon
when
he
made
a
beginning
by
showing
the
rest
that
they
knew
nothing
about
handling
cannon
next
thing
he
does
he
tumbles
upon
us
a
little
slip
of
a
of
the
army
of
italy
which
had
neither
bread
nor
ammunition
nor
shoes
nor
clothes
a
wretched
army
as
naked
as
a
worm
friends
he
said
here
we
all
are
together
now
get
it
well
into
your
pates
that
in
a
fortnight
s
time
from
now
you
will
be
the
victors
and
dressed
in
new
clothes
you
shall
all
have
greatcoats
strong
gaiters
and
famous
pairs
of
shoes
but
my
children
you
will
have
to
march
on
milan
to
take
them
where
all
these
things
so
they
marched
the
french
crushed
as
flat
as
a
pancake
held
up
their
heads
again
there
were
thirty
thousand
of
us
tatterdemalions
against
eighty
thousand
swaggerers
of
germans
fine
tall
men
and
well
equipped
i
can
see
them
yet
then
napoleon
who
was
only
bonaparte
in
those
days
breathed
goodness
knows
what
into
us
and
on
we
marched
night
and
day
we
rap
their
knuckles
at
montenotte
we
hurry
on
to
thrash
them
at
rivoli
lodi
arcola
and
millesimo
and
we
never
let
them
go
the
army
came
to
have
a
liking
for
winning
battles
then
napoleon
hems
them
in
on
all
sides
these
german
generals
did
not
know
where
to
hide
themselves
so
as
to
have
a
little
peace
and
comfort
he
drubs
them
soundly
cribs
ten
thousand
of
their
men
at
a
time
by
surrounding
them
with
fifteen
hundred
frenchmen
whom
he
makes
to
spring
up
after
his
fashion
and
at
last
he
takes
their
cannon
victuals
money
ammunition
and
everything
they
have
that
is
worth
taking
he
pitches
them
into
the
water
beats
them
on
the
mountains
snaps
at
them
in
the
air
gobbles
them
up
on
the
earth
and
thrashes
them
everywhere
there
are
the
troops
in
full
feather
again
for
look
you
the
emperor
who
for
that
matter
was
a
wit
soon
sent
for
the
inhabitant
and
told
him
that
he
had
come
there
to
deliver
him
whereupon
the
civilian
finds
us
free
quarters
and
makes
much
of
us
so
do
the
women
who
showed
great
discernment
to
come
to
a
final
end
in
ventose
which
was
at
that
time
what
the
month
of
march
is
now
we
had
been
driven
up
into
a
corner
of
the
pays
des
marmottes
but
after
the
campaign
lo
and
behold
we
were
the
masters
of
italy
just
as
napoleon
had
prophesied
and
in
the
month
of
march
following
in
one
year
and
in
two
campaigns
he
brings
us
within
sight
of
vienna
we
had
made
a
clean
sweep
of
them
we
had
gobbled
down
three
armies
one
after
another
and
taken
the
conceit
out
of
four
austrian
generals
one
of
them
an
old
man
who
had
white
hair
had
been
roasted
like
a
rat
in
the
straw
before
mantua
the
kings
were
suing
for
mercy
on
their
knees
peace
had
been
won
could
a
mere
mortal
have
done
that
no
god
helped
him
that
is
certain
he
distributed
himself
about
like
the
five
loaves
in
the
gospel
commanded
on
the
battlefield
all
day
and
drew
up
his
plans
at
night
the
sentries
always
saw
him
coming
he
neither
ate
nor
slept
therefore
recognizing
these
prodigies
the
soldier
adopts
him
for
his
father
but
forward
the
other
folk
there
in
paris
seeing
all
this
say
among
themselves
here
is
a
pilgrim
who
appears
to
take
his
instructions
from
heaven
above
he
is
uncommonly
likely
to
lay
a
hand
on
france
we
must
let
him
loose
on
asia
or
america
and
that
perhaps
will
keep
him
quiet
the
same
thing
was
decreed
for
him
as
for
jesus
christ
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
give
him
orders
to
go
on
duty
down
in
egypt
see
his
resemblance
to
the
son
of
god
that
is
not
all
though
he
calls
all
his
about
him
all
those
into
whom
he
had
more
particularly
put
the
devil
and
talks
to
them
in
this
way
my
friends
for
the
time
being
they
are
giving
us
egypt
to
stop
our
mouths
but
we
will
swallow
down
egypt
in
a
brace
of
shakes
just
as
we
swallowed
italy
and
private
soldiers
shall
be
princes
and
shall
have
broad
lands
of
their
own
forward
forward
lads
cry
the
sergeants
so
we
come
to
toulon
on
the
way
to
egypt
whereupon
the
english
put
to
sea
with
all
their
fleet
but
when
we
are
on
board
napoleon
says
to
us
they
will
not
see
us
and
it
is
right
and
proper
that
you
should
know
henceforward
that
your
general
has
a
star
in
the
sky
that
guides
us
and
watches
over
us
so
said
so
done
as
we
sailed
over
the
sea
we
took
malta
by
way
of
an
orange
to
quench
his
thirst
for
victory
for
he
was
a
man
who
must
always
be
doing
something
there
we
are
in
egypt
well
and
good
different
orders
the
egyptians
look
you
are
men
who
ever
since
the
world
has
been
the
world
have
been
in
the
habit
of
having
giants
to
reign
over
them
and
armies
like
swarms
of
ants
because
it
is
a
country
full
of
genii
and
crocodiles
where
they
have
built
up
pyramids
as
big
as
our
mountains
the
fancy
took
them
to
stow
their
kings
under
the
pyramids
so
as
to
keep
them
fresh
a
thing
which
mightily
pleases
them
all
round
out
there
whereupon
as
we
landed
the
little
corporal
said
to
us
my
children
the
country
which
you
are
about
to
conquer
worships
a
lot
of
idols
which
you
must
respect
because
the
frenchman
ought
to
be
on
good
terms
with
all
the
world
and
fight
people
without
giving
annoyance
get
it
well
into
your
heads
to
let
everything
alone
at
first
for
we
shall
have
it
all
by
and
by
and
forward
so
far
so
good
but
all
those
people
had
heard
a
prophecy
of
napoleon
under
the
name
of
a
word
which
in
our
lingo
means
the
sultan
fires
a
shot
and
they
feared
him
like
the
devil
so
the
grand
turk
asia
and
africa
have
recourse
to
magic
and
they
send
a
demon
against
us
named
the
mahdi
who
it
was
thought
had
come
down
from
heaven
on
a
white
charger
which
like
its
master
was
and
the
pair
of
them
lived
on
the
air
of
that
part
of
the
world
there
are
people
who
have
seen
them
but
for
my
part
i
can
not
give
you
any
certain
informations
about
them
they
were
the
divinities
of
arabia
and
of
the
mamelukes
who
wished
their
troopers
to
believe
that
the
mahdi
had
the
power
of
preventing
them
from
dying
in
battle
they
gave
out
that
he
was
an
angel
sent
down
to
wage
war
on
napoleon
and
to
get
back
solomon
s
seal
part
of
their
paraphernalia
which
they
pretended
our
general
had
stolen
you
will
readily
understand
that
we
made
them
cry
peccavi
all
the
same
ah
just
tell
me
now
how
they
came
to
know
about
that
compact
of
napoleon
s
was
that
natural
they
took
it
into
their
heads
for
certain
that
he
commanded
the
genii
and
that
he
went
from
place
to
place
like
a
bird
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
it
is
a
fact
that
he
was
everywhere
at
length
it
came
about
that
he
carried
off
a
queen
of
theirs
she
was
the
private
property
of
a
mameluke
who
although
he
had
several
more
of
them
flatly
refused
to
strike
a
bargain
though
the
other
offered
all
his
treasures
for
her
and
diamonds
as
big
as
pigeon
s
eggs
when
things
had
come
to
that
pass
they
could
not
well
be
settled
without
a
good
deal
of
fighting
and
there
was
fighting
enough
for
everybody
and
no
mistake
about
it
then
we
are
drawn
up
before
alexandria
and
again
at
gizeh
and
before
the
pyramids
we
had
to
march
over
the
sands
and
in
the
sun
people
whose
eyes
dazzled
used
to
see
water
that
they
could
not
drink
and
shade
that
made
them
fume
but
we
made
short
work
of
the
mamelukes
as
usual
and
everything
goes
down
before
the
voice
of
napoleon
who
seizes
upper
and
lower
egypt
and
arabia
far
and
wide
till
we
came
to
the
capitals
of
kingdoms
which
no
longer
existed
where
there
were
thousands
and
thousands
of
statues
of
all
the
devils
in
creation
all
done
to
the
life
and
another
curious
thing
too
any
quantity
of
lizards
a
confounded
country
where
any
one
could
have
as
many
acres
of
land
as
he
wished
for
as
little
as
he
pleased
while
he
was
busy
inland
where
he
meant
to
carry
out
some
wonderful
ideas
of
his
the
english
burn
his
fleet
for
him
in
aboukir
bay
for
they
never
could
do
enough
to
annoy
us
but
napoleon
who
was
respected
east
and
west
and
called
my
son
by
the
pope
and
my
dear
father
by
mahomet
s
cousin
makes
up
his
mind
to
have
his
revenge
on
england
and
to
take
india
in
exchange
for
his
fleet
he
set
out
to
lead
us
into
asia
by
way
of
the
red
sea
through
a
country
where
there
were
palaces
for
and
nothing
but
gold
and
diamonds
to
pay
the
troops
with
when
the
mahdi
comes
to
an
understanding
with
the
plague
and
sends
it
among
us
to
make
a
break
in
our
victories
halt
then
every
man
files
off
to
that
parade
from
which
no
one
comes
back
on
his
two
feet
the
dying
soldier
can
not
take
acre
into
which
he
forces
an
entrance
three
times
with
a
warrior
s
impetuous
enthusiasm
the
plague
was
too
strong
for
us
there
was
not
even
time
to
say
your
servant
sir
to
the
plague
every
man
was
down
with
it
napoleon
alone
was
as
fresh
as
a
rose
the
whole
army
saw
him
drinking
in
the
plague
without
it
doing
him
any
harm
whatever
there
now
my
friends
was
that
natural
do
you
think
the
mamelukes
knowing
that
we
were
all
on
the
want
to
stop
our
road
but
it
was
no
use
trying
that
nonsense
with
napoleon
so
he
spoke
to
his
familiars
who
had
tougher
skins
than
the
rest
go
and
clear
the
road
for
junot
who
was
his
devoted
friend
and
a
fighter
only
takes
a
thousand
men
and
makes
a
clean
sweep
of
the
pasha
s
army
which
had
the
impudence
to
bar
our
way
thereupon
back
we
came
to
cairo
our
headquarters
and
now
for
another
story
napoleon
being
out
of
the
country
france
allowed
the
people
in
paris
to
worry
the
life
out
of
her
they
kept
back
the
soldiers
pay
and
all
their
linen
and
clothing
left
them
to
starve
and
expected
them
to
lay
down
law
to
the
universe
without
taking
any
further
trouble
in
the
matter
they
were
idiots
of
the
kind
that
amuse
themselves
with
chattering
instead
of
setting
themselves
to
knead
the
dough
so
our
armies
were
defeated
france
could
not
keep
her
frontiers
the
man
was
not
there
i
say
the
man
look
you
because
that
was
how
they
called
him
but
it
was
stuff
and
nonsense
for
he
had
a
star
of
his
own
and
all
his
other
peculiarities
it
was
the
rest
of
us
that
were
mere
men
he
hears
this
history
of
france
after
his
famous
battle
of
aboukir
where
with
a
single
division
he
routed
the
grand
army
of
the
turks
thousand
strong
and
jostled
more
than
half
of
them
into
the
sea
rrrah
without
losing
more
than
three
hundred
of
his
own
men
that
was
his
last
in
egypt
he
said
to
himself
seeing
that
all
was
lost
down
there
i
know
that
i
am
the
saviour
of
france
and
to
france
i
must
but
you
must
clearly
understand
that
the
army
did
not
know
of
his
departure
for
if
they
had
they
would
have
kept
him
there
by
force
to
make
him
emperor
of
the
east
so
there
we
all
are
without
him
and
in
low
spirits
for
he
was
the
life
of
us
he
leaves
kleber
in
command
a
great
watchdog
who
passed
in
his
checks
at
cairo
murdered
by
an
egyptian
whom
they
put
to
death
by
spiking
him
with
a
bayonet
which
is
their
way
of
guillotining
people
out
there
but
he
suffered
so
much
that
a
soldier
took
pity
on
the
scoundrel
and
handed
his
flask
to
him
and
the
egyptian
turned
up
his
eyes
then
and
there
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
but
there
is
not
much
fun
for
us
about
this
little
affair
napoleon
steps
aboard
of
a
little
cockleshell
a
mere
nothing
of
a
skiff
called
the
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
in
the
teeth
of
the
english
who
were
blockading
the
place
with
vessels
of
the
line
and
cruisers
and
everything
that
carries
canvas
he
lands
in
france
for
he
always
had
the
faculty
of
taking
the
sea
at
a
stride
was
that
natural
bah
as
soon
as
he
landed
at
frejus
it
is
as
good
as
saying
that
he
has
set
foot
in
paris
everybody
there
worships
him
but
he
calls
the
government
together
what
have
you
done
to
my
children
the
soldiers
he
says
to
the
lawyers
you
are
a
set
of
who
make
fools
of
other
people
and
feather
your
own
nests
at
the
expense
of
france
it
will
not
do
i
speak
in
the
name
of
every
one
who
is
thereupon
they
want
to
put
him
off
and
to
get
rid
of
him
but
not
a
bit
of
it
he
locks
them
up
in
the
barracks
where
they
used
to
argufy
and
makes
them
jump
out
of
the
windows
then
he
makes
them
follow
in
his
train
and
they
all
become
as
mute
as
fishes
and
supple
as
tobacco
pouches
so
he
becomes
consul
at
a
blow
he
was
not
the
man
to
doubt
the
existence
of
the
supreme
being
he
kept
his
word
with
providence
who
had
kept
his
promise
in
earnest
he
sets
up
religion
again
and
gives
back
the
churches
and
they
ring
the
bells
for
god
and
napoleon
so
every
one
is
satisfied
the
priests
with
whom
he
allows
no
one
to
meddle
the
merchant
folk
who
carry
on
their
trades
without
fear
of
the
of
the
law
that
had
pressed
too
heavily
on
them
the
nobles
for
people
had
fallen
into
an
unfortunate
habit
of
putting
them
to
death
and
he
puts
a
stop
to
this
but
there
were
enemies
to
be
cleared
out
of
the
way
and
he
was
not
the
one
to
go
to
sleep
after
mess
and
his
eyes
look
you
traveled
all
over
the
world
as
if
it
had
been
a
man
s
face
the
next
thing
he
did
was
to
turn
up
in
italy
it
was
just
as
if
he
had
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
the
sight
of
him
was
enough
they
gulp
down
the
austrians
at
marengo
like
a
whale
swallowing
gudgeons
the
french
victories
blew
their
trumpets
so
loud
that
the
whole
world
could
hear
the
noise
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
we
will
not
keep
on
at
this
game
any
longer
say
the
germans
that
is
enough
of
this
sort
of
thing
say
the
others
here
is
the
upshot
europe
shows
the
white
feather
england
knuckles
under
general
peace
all
round
and
kings
and
peoples
pretending
to
embrace
each
other
while
then
and
there
the
emperor
hits
on
the
idea
of
the
legion
of
honor
there
s
a
fine
thing
if
you
like
he
spoke
to
the
whole
army
at
boulogne
in
france
so
he
said
every
man
is
brave
so
the
civilian
who
does
gloriously
shall
be
the
soldier
s
sister
the
soldier
shall
be
his
brother
and
both
shall
stand
together
beneath
the
flag
of
by
the
time
that
the
rest
of
us
who
were
away
down
there
in
egypt
had
come
back
again
everything
was
changed
we
had
seen
him
last
as
a
general
and
in
no
time
we
find
that
he
is
emperor
and
when
this
was
settled
and
it
may
safely
be
said
that
every
one
was
satisfied
there
was
a
holy
ceremony
such
as
was
never
seen
under
the
canopy
of
heaven
faith
france
gave
herself
to
him
like
a
handsome
girl
to
a
lancer
and
the
pope
and
all
his
cardinals
in
robes
of
red
and
gold
come
across
the
alps
on
purpose
to
anoint
him
before
the
army
and
the
people
who
clap
their
hands
there
is
one
thing
that
it
would
be
very
wrong
to
keep
back
from
you
while
he
was
in
egypt
in
the
desert
not
far
away
from
syria
the
red
man
had
appeared
to
him
on
the
mountain
of
moses
in
order
to
say
everything
is
going
on
then
again
on
the
eve
of
victory
at
marengo
red
springs
to
his
feet
in
front
of
the
emperor
for
the
second
time
and
says
to
him
you
shall
see
the
world
at
your
feet
you
shall
be
emperor
of
the
french
king
of
italy
master
of
holland
ruler
of
spain
portugal
and
the
illyrian
provinces
protector
of
germany
saviour
of
poland
first
eagle
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
all
the
rest
of
that
red
man
look
you
was
a
notion
of
his
own
who
ran
on
errands
and
carried
messages
so
many
people
say
between
him
and
his
star
i
myself
have
never
believed
that
but
the
red
man
is
undoubtedly
a
fact
napoleon
himself
spoke
of
the
red
man
who
lived
up
in
the
roof
of
the
tuileries
and
who
used
to
come
to
him
he
said
in
moments
of
trouble
and
difficulty
so
on
the
night
after
his
coronation
napoleon
saw
him
for
the
third
time
and
they
talked
over
a
lot
of
things
together
then
the
emperor
goes
straight
to
milan
to
have
himself
crowned
king
of
italy
and
then
came
the
real
triumph
of
the
soldier
for
every
one
who
could
write
became
an
officer
forthwith
and
pensions
and
gifts
of
duchies
poured
down
in
showers
there
were
fortunes
for
the
staff
that
never
cost
france
a
penny
and
the
legion
of
honor
was
as
good
as
an
annuity
for
the
rank
and
file
i
still
draw
my
pension
on
the
strength
of
it
in
short
here
were
armies
provided
for
in
a
way
that
had
never
been
seen
before
but
the
emperor
who
knew
that
he
was
to
be
emperor
over
everybody
and
not
only
over
the
army
bethinks
himself
of
the
bourgeois
and
sets
them
to
build
fairy
monuments
in
places
that
had
been
as
bare
as
the
back
of
my
hand
till
then
suppose
now
that
you
are
coming
out
of
spain
and
on
the
way
to
berlin
well
you
would
see
triumphal
arches
and
in
the
sculpture
upon
them
the
common
soldiers
are
done
every
bit
as
beautifully
as
the
generals
in
two
or
three
years
napoleon
fills
his
cellars
with
gold
makes
bridges
palaces
roads
scholars
festivals
laws
fleets
and
harbors
he
spends
millions
on
millions
ever
so
much
and
ever
so
much
more
to
it
so
that
i
have
heard
it
said
that
he
could
have
paved
the
whole
of
france
with
pieces
if
the
fancy
had
taken
him
and
all
this
without
putting
any
taxes
on
you
people
here
so
when
he
was
comfortably
seated
on
his
throne
and
so
thoroughly
the
master
of
the
situation
that
all
europe
was
waiting
for
leave
to
do
anything
for
him
that
he
might
happen
to
want
as
he
had
four
brothers
and
three
sisters
he
said
to
us
just
as
it
might
be
by
way
of
conversation
in
the
order
of
the
day
children
is
it
fitting
that
your
emperor
s
relations
should
beg
their
bread
no
i
want
them
all
to
be
luminaries
like
me
in
fact
therefore
it
is
urgently
necessary
to
conquer
a
kingdom
for
each
one
of
them
so
that
the
french
nation
may
be
masters
everywhere
so
that
the
guard
may
make
the
whole
earth
tremble
and
france
may
spit
wherever
she
likes
and
every
nation
shall
say
to
her
as
it
is
written
on
my
coins
god
protects
all
right
answers
the
army
we
will
fish
up
kingdoms
for
you
with
the
ah
there
was
no
backing
out
of
it
look
you
if
he
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
conquer
the
moon
we
should
have
had
to
put
everything
in
train
pack
our
knapsacks
and
scramble
up
luckily
he
had
no
wish
for
that
excursion
the
kings
who
were
used
to
the
comforts
of
a
throne
of
course
objected
to
be
lugged
off
so
we
had
marching
orders
we
march
we
get
there
and
the
earth
begins
to
shake
to
its
centre
again
what
times
they
were
for
wearing
out
men
and
and
the
hard
knocks
that
they
gave
us
only
frenchmen
could
have
stood
it
but
you
are
not
ignorant
that
a
frenchman
is
a
born
philosopher
he
knows
that
he
must
die
a
little
sooner
or
a
litter
later
so
we
used
to
die
without
a
word
because
we
had
the
pleasure
of
watching
the
emperor
do
on
the
here
the
soldier
swung
quickly
round
on
one
foot
so
as
to
trace
a
circle
on
the
barn
floor
with
the
other
there
that
shall
be
a
kingdom
he
used
to
say
and
it
was
a
kingdom
what
fine
times
they
were
colonels
became
generals
whilst
you
were
looking
at
them
generals
became
marshals
of
france
and
marshals
became
kings
there
is
one
of
them
still
left
on
his
feet
to
keep
europe
in
mind
of
those
days
gascon
though
he
may
be
and
a
traitor
to
france
that
he
might
keep
his
crown
and
he
did
not
blush
for
his
shame
for
after
all
a
crown
look
you
is
made
of
gold
the
very
sappers
and
miners
who
knew
how
to
read
became
great
nobles
in
the
same
way
and
i
who
am
telling
you
all
this
have
seen
in
paris
eleven
kings
and
a
crowd
of
princes
all
round
about
napoleon
like
rays
about
the
sun
keep
this
well
in
your
minds
that
as
every
soldier
stood
a
chance
of
having
a
throne
of
his
own
provided
he
showed
himself
worthy
of
it
a
corporal
of
the
guard
was
by
way
of
being
a
sight
to
see
and
they
gaped
at
him
as
he
went
by
for
every
one
came
by
his
share
after
a
victory
it
was
made
perfectly
clear
in
the
bulletin
and
what
battles
they
were
austerlitz
where
the
army
was
manoeuvred
as
if
it
had
been
a
review
eylau
where
the
russians
were
drowned
in
a
lake
just
as
if
napoleon
had
breathed
on
them
and
blown
them
in
wagram
where
the
fighting
was
kept
up
for
three
whole
days
without
flinching
in
short
there
were
as
many
battles
as
there
are
saints
in
the
calendar
then
it
was
made
clear
beyond
a
doubt
that
napoleon
bore
the
sword
of
god
in
his
scabbard
he
had
a
regard
for
the
soldier
he
took
the
soldier
for
his
child
he
was
anxious
that
you
should
have
shoes
shirts
greatcoats
bread
and
cartridges
but
he
kept
up
his
majesty
too
for
reigning
was
his
own
particular
occupation
but
all
the
same
a
sergeant
or
even
a
common
soldier
could
go
up
to
him
and
call
him
emperor
just
as
you
might
say
my
good
friend
to
me
at
times
and
he
would
give
an
answer
to
anything
you
put
before
him
he
used
to
sleep
on
the
snow
just
like
the
rest
of
us
in
short
he
looked
almost
like
an
ordinary
man
but
i
who
am
telling
you
all
these
things
have
seen
him
myself
with
the
whizzing
about
his
ears
no
more
put
out
by
it
than
you
are
at
this
moment
never
moving
a
limb
watching
through
his
always
looking
after
his
business
so
we
stood
our
ground
likewise
as
cool
and
calm
as
john
the
baptist
i
do
not
know
how
he
did
it
but
whenever
he
spoke
a
something
in
his
words
made
our
hearts
burn
within
us
and
just
to
let
him
see
that
we
were
his
children
and
that
it
was
not
in
us
to
shirk
or
flinch
we
used
to
walk
just
as
usual
right
up
to
the
sluts
of
cannon
that
were
belching
smoke
and
vomiting
battalions
of
balls
and
never
a
man
would
so
much
as
say
look
out
it
was
a
something
that
made
dying
men
raise
their
heads
to
salute
him
and
cry
long
live
the
emperor
was
that
natural
would
you
have
done
this
for
a
mere
man
thereupon
having
fitted
up
all
his
family
and
things
having
so
turned
out
that
the
empress
josephine
a
good
woman
for
all
that
had
no
children
he
was
obliged
to
part
company
with
her
although
he
loved
her
not
a
little
but
he
must
have
children
for
reasons
of
state
all
the
crowned
heads
of
europe
when
they
heard
of
his
difficulty
squabbled
among
themselves
as
to
who
should
find
him
a
wife
he
married
an
austrian
princess
so
they
say
who
was
the
daughter
of
the
caesars
a
man
of
antiquity
whom
everybody
talks
about
not
only
in
our
country
where
it
is
said
that
most
things
were
his
doing
but
also
all
over
europe
and
so
certain
sure
is
that
that
i
who
am
talking
to
you
have
been
myself
across
the
danube
where
i
saw
the
ruins
of
a
bridge
built
by
that
man
and
it
appeared
that
he
was
some
connection
of
napoleon
s
at
rome
for
the
emperor
claimed
succession
there
for
his
son
so
after
his
wedding
which
was
a
holiday
for
the
whole
world
and
when
they
let
the
people
off
their
taxes
for
ten
years
to
come
though
they
had
to
pay
them
just
the
same
after
all
because
the
excisemen
took
no
notice
of
the
proclamation
after
his
wedding
i
say
his
wife
had
a
child
who
was
king
of
rome
a
child
was
born
a
king
while
his
father
was
alive
a
thing
that
had
never
been
seen
in
the
world
before
that
day
a
balloon
set
out
from
paris
to
carry
the
news
to
rome
and
went
all
the
way
in
one
day
there
now
is
there
one
of
you
who
will
stand
me
out
that
there
was
nothing
supernatural
in
that
no
it
was
decreed
on
high
and
the
mischief
take
those
who
will
not
allow
that
it
was
wafted
over
by
god
himself
so
as
to
add
to
the
honor
and
glory
of
france
but
there
was
the
emperor
of
russia
a
friend
of
our
emperor
s
who
was
put
out
because
he
had
not
married
a
russian
lady
so
the
russian
backs
up
our
enemies
the
english
for
there
had
always
been
something
to
prevent
napoleon
from
putting
a
spoke
in
their
wheel
clearly
an
end
must
be
made
of
fowl
of
that
feather
napoleon
is
vexed
and
he
says
to
us
soldiers
you
have
been
the
masters
of
every
capital
in
europe
except
moscow
which
is
allied
to
england
so
in
order
to
conquer
london
and
india
which
belongs
to
them
in
london
i
find
it
absolutely
necessary
that
we
go
to
thereupon
the
greatest
army
that
ever
wore
gaiters
and
left
its
footprints
all
over
the
globe
is
brought
together
and
drawn
up
with
such
peculiar
cleverness
that
the
emperor
passed
a
million
men
in
review
all
in
a
single
day
hourra
cry
the
russians
and
there
is
all
russia
assembled
a
lot
of
brutes
of
cossacks
that
you
never
can
come
up
with
it
was
country
against
country
a
general
stramash
we
had
to
look
out
for
ourselves
it
was
all
asia
against
europe
as
the
red
man
had
said
to
napoleon
all
right
napoleon
had
answered
i
shall
be
ready
for
and
there
in
fact
were
all
the
kings
who
came
to
lick
napoleon
s
hand
austria
prussia
bavaria
saxony
poland
and
italy
all
speaking
us
fair
and
going
along
with
us
it
was
a
fine
thing
the
eagles
had
never
cooed
before
as
they
did
on
parade
in
those
days
when
they
were
reared
above
all
the
flags
of
all
the
nations
of
europe
the
poles
could
not
contain
their
joy
because
the
emperor
had
a
notion
of
setting
up
their
kingdom
again
and
ever
since
poland
and
france
have
always
been
like
brothers
in
short
the
army
shouts
russia
shall
be
ours
we
cross
the
frontiers
all
the
lot
of
us
we
march
and
better
march
but
never
a
russian
do
we
see
at
last
all
our
are
encamped
at
borodino
that
was
where
i
received
the
cross
and
there
is
no
denying
that
it
was
a
cursed
battle
the
emperor
was
not
easy
in
his
mind
he
had
seen
the
red
man
who
said
to
him
my
child
you
are
going
a
little
too
fast
for
your
feet
you
will
run
short
of
men
and
your
friends
will
play
you
thereupon
the
emperor
proposes
a
treaty
but
before
he
signs
it
he
says
to
us
let
us
give
these
russians
a
drubbing
all
right
cried
the
army
forward
say
the
sergeants
my
clothes
were
all
falling
to
pieces
my
shoes
were
worn
out
with
trapezing
over
those
roads
out
there
which
are
not
good
going
at
all
but
it
is
all
one
since
here
is
the
last
of
the
row
said
i
to
myself
i
mean
to
get
all
i
can
out
of
we
were
posted
before
the
great
ravine
we
had
seats
in
the
front
row
the
signal
is
given
and
seven
hundred
guns
begin
a
conversation
fit
to
make
the
blood
spirt
from
your
ears
one
should
give
the
devil
his
due
and
the
russians
let
themselves
be
cut
in
pieces
just
like
frenchmen
they
did
not
give
way
and
we
made
no
advance
forward
is
the
cry
here
is
the
emperor
so
it
was
he
rides
past
us
at
a
gallop
and
makes
a
sign
to
us
that
a
great
deal
depends
on
our
carrying
the
redoubt
he
puts
fresh
heart
into
us
we
rush
forward
i
am
the
first
man
to
reach
the
gorge
ah
how
they
fell
colonels
lieutenants
and
common
soldiers
all
alike
there
were
shoes
to
fit
up
those
who
had
none
and
epaulettes
for
the
knowing
fellows
that
knew
how
to
write
victory
is
the
cry
all
along
the
line
and
upon
my
word
there
were
thousand
frenchmen
lying
on
the
field
no
more
i
assure
you
such
a
thing
was
never
seen
before
it
was
just
like
a
field
when
the
corn
is
cut
with
a
man
lying
there
for
every
ear
of
corn
that
sobered
the
rest
of
us
the
man
comes
and
we
make
a
circle
round
about
him
and
he
coaxes
us
round
for
he
could
be
very
nice
when
he
chose
and
persuades
us
to
dine
with
duke
humphrey
when
we
were
hungry
as
hunters
then
our
consoler
distributes
the
crosses
of
the
legion
of
honor
himself
salutes
the
dead
and
says
to
us
on
to
moscow
to
moscow
so
be
it
says
the
army
we
take
moscow
what
do
the
russians
do
but
set
fire
to
their
city
there
was
a
blaze
two
leagues
of
bonfire
that
burned
for
two
days
the
buildings
fell
about
our
ears
like
slates
and
molten
lead
and
iron
came
down
in
showers
it
was
really
horrible
it
was
a
light
to
see
our
sorrows
by
i
can
tell
you
the
emperor
said
there
that
is
enough
of
this
sort
of
thing
all
my
men
shall
stay
we
amuse
ourselves
for
a
bit
by
recruiting
and
repairing
our
frames
for
we
really
were
much
fatigued
by
the
campaign
we
take
away
with
us
a
gold
cross
from
the
top
of
the
kremlin
and
every
soldier
had
a
little
fortune
but
on
the
way
back
the
winter
came
down
on
us
a
month
earlier
than
usual
a
matter
which
the
learned
like
a
set
of
fools
have
never
sufficiently
explained
and
we
are
nipped
with
the
cold
we
were
no
longer
an
army
after
that
do
you
understand
there
was
an
end
of
generals
and
even
of
the
sergeants
hunger
and
misery
took
the
command
instead
and
all
of
us
were
absolutely
equal
under
their
reign
all
we
thought
of
was
how
to
get
back
to
france
no
one
stooped
to
pick
up
his
gun
or
his
money
every
one
walked
straight
before
him
and
armed
himself
as
he
thought
fit
and
no
one
cared
about
glory
the
emperor
saw
nothing
of
his
star
all
the
time
for
the
weather
was
so
bad
there
was
some
misunderstanding
between
him
and
heaven
poor
man
how
bad
he
felt
when
he
saw
his
eagles
flying
with
their
backs
turned
on
victory
that
was
really
too
rough
well
the
next
thing
is
the
beresina
and
here
and
now
my
friends
any
one
can
assure
you
on
his
honor
and
by
all
that
is
sacred
that
no
never
since
there
have
been
men
on
earth
never
in
this
world
has
there
been
such
a
fricasse
of
an
army
caissons
transports
artillery
and
all
in
such
snow
as
that
and
under
such
a
pitiless
sky
it
was
so
cold
that
you
burned
your
hand
on
the
barrel
of
your
gun
if
you
happened
to
touch
it
there
it
was
that
the
pontooners
saved
the
army
for
the
pontooners
stood
firm
at
their
posts
it
was
there
that
gondrin
behaved
like
a
hero
and
he
is
the
sole
survivor
of
all
the
men
who
were
dogged
enough
to
stand
in
the
river
so
as
to
build
the
bridges
on
which
the
army
crossed
over
and
so
escaped
the
russians
who
still
respected
the
grand
army
on
account
of
its
past
victories
and
gondrin
is
an
accomplished
soldier
he
went
on
pointing
to
his
friend
who
was
gazing
at
him
with
the
rapt
attention
peculiar
to
deaf
people
a
distinguished
soldier
who
deserves
to
have
your
very
highest
esteem
i
saw
the
emperor
standing
by
the
bridge
he
went
on
and
never
feeling
the
cold
at
all
was
that
again
a
natural
thing
he
was
looking
on
at
the
loss
of
his
treasures
of
his
friends
and
those
who
had
fought
with
him
in
egypt
bah
there
was
an
end
of
everything
women
and
wagons
and
guns
were
all
engulfed
and
swallowed
up
everything
went
to
wreck
and
ruin
a
few
of
the
bravest
among
us
saved
the
eagles
for
the
eagles
look
you
meant
france
and
all
the
rest
of
you
it
was
the
civil
and
military
honor
of
france
that
was
in
our
keeping
there
must
be
no
spot
on
the
honor
of
france
and
the
cold
could
never
make
her
bow
her
head
there
was
no
getting
warm
except
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
emperor
for
whenever
he
was
in
danger
we
hurried
up
all
frozen
as
we
were
we
who
would
not
stop
to
hold
out
a
hand
to
a
fallen
friend
they
say
too
that
he
shed
tears
of
a
night
over
his
poor
family
of
soldiers
only
he
and
frenchmen
could
have
pulled
themselves
out
of
such
a
plight
but
we
did
pull
ourselves
out
though
as
i
am
telling
you
it
was
with
loss
ay
and
heavy
loss
the
allies
had
eaten
up
all
our
provisions
everybody
began
to
betray
him
just
as
the
red
man
had
foretold
the
in
paris
who
had
kept
quiet
ever
since
the
imperial
guard
had
been
established
think
that
he
is
dead
and
hatch
a
conspiracy
they
set
to
work
in
the
home
office
to
overturn
the
emperor
these
things
come
to
his
knowledge
and
worry
him
he
says
to
us
at
parting
children
keep
to
your
posts
i
will
come
back
bah
those
generals
of
his
lose
their
heads
at
once
for
when
he
was
away
it
was
not
like
the
same
thing
the
marshals
fall
out
among
themselves
and
make
blunders
as
was
only
natural
for
napoleon
in
his
kindness
had
fed
them
on
gold
till
they
had
grown
as
fat
as
butter
and
they
had
no
mind
to
march
troubles
came
of
this
for
many
of
them
stayed
inactive
in
garrison
towns
in
the
rear
without
attempting
to
tickle
up
the
backs
of
the
enemy
behind
us
and
we
were
being
driven
back
on
france
but
napoleon
comes
back
among
us
with
fresh
troops
conscripts
they
were
and
famous
conscripts
too
he
had
put
some
thorough
notions
of
discipline
into
them
the
whelps
were
good
to
set
their
teeth
in
anybody
he
had
a
bourgeois
guard
of
honor
too
and
fine
troops
they
were
they
melted
away
like
butter
on
a
gridiron
we
may
put
a
bold
front
on
it
but
everything
is
against
us
although
the
army
still
performs
prodigies
of
valor
whole
nations
fought
against
nations
in
tremendous
battles
at
dresden
lutzen
and
bautzen
and
then
it
was
that
france
showed
extraordinary
heroism
for
you
must
all
of
you
bear
in
mind
that
in
those
times
a
stout
grenadier
only
lasted
six
months
we
always
won
the
day
but
the
english
were
always
on
our
track
putting
nonsense
into
other
nations
heads
and
stirring
them
up
to
revolt
in
short
we
cleared
a
way
through
all
these
mobs
of
nations
for
wherever
the
emperor
appeared
we
made
a
passage
for
him
for
on
the
land
as
on
the
sea
whenever
he
said
i
wish
to
go
forward
we
made
the
way
there
comes
a
final
end
to
it
at
last
we
are
back
in
france
and
in
spite
of
the
bitter
weather
it
did
one
s
heart
good
to
breathe
one
s
native
air
again
it
set
up
many
a
poor
fellow
and
as
for
me
it
put
new
life
into
me
i
can
tell
you
but
it
was
a
question
all
at
once
of
defending
france
our
fair
land
of
france
all
europe
was
up
in
arms
against
us
they
took
it
in
bad
part
that
we
had
tried
to
keep
the
russians
in
order
by
driving
them
back
within
their
own
borders
so
that
they
should
not
gobble
us
up
for
those
northern
folk
have
a
strong
liking
for
eating
up
the
men
of
the
south
it
is
a
habit
they
have
i
have
heard
the
same
thing
of
them
from
several
generals
so
the
emperor
finds
his
own
his
friends
whom
he
had
made
crowned
kings
and
the
rabble
of
princes
to
whom
he
had
given
back
their
thrones
were
all
against
him
even
frenchmen
and
allies
in
our
own
ranks
turned
against
us
by
orders
from
high
quarters
as
at
leipsic
common
soldiers
would
hardly
be
capable
of
such
abominations
yet
these
princes
as
they
called
themselves
broke
their
words
three
times
a
day
the
next
thing
they
do
is
to
invade
france
wherever
our
emperor
shows
his
lion
s
face
the
enemy
beats
a
retreat
he
worked
more
miracles
for
the
defence
of
france
than
he
had
ever
wrought
in
the
conquest
of
italy
the
east
spain
europe
and
russia
he
has
a
mind
to
bury
every
foreigner
in
french
soil
to
give
them
a
respect
for
france
so
he
lets
them
come
close
up
to
paris
so
as
to
do
for
them
at
a
single
blow
and
to
rise
to
the
highest
height
of
genius
in
the
biggest
battle
that
ever
was
fought
a
mother
of
battles
but
the
parisians
wanting
to
save
their
trumpery
skins
and
afraid
for
their
twopenny
shops
open
their
gates
and
there
is
a
beginning
of
the
and
an
end
of
all
joy
and
happiness
they
make
a
fool
of
the
empress
and
fly
the
white
flag
out
at
the
windows
the
emperor
s
closest
friends
among
his
generals
forsake
him
at
last
and
go
over
to
the
bourbons
of
whom
no
one
had
ever
heard
tell
then
he
bids
us
farewell
at
fontainbleau
soldiers
i
can
hear
him
yet
we
were
all
crying
just
like
children
the
eagles
and
the
flags
had
been
lowered
as
if
for
a
funeral
ah
and
it
was
a
funeral
i
can
tell
you
it
was
the
funeral
of
the
empire
those
smart
armies
of
his
were
nothing
but
skeletons
now
so
he
stood
there
on
the
flight
of
steps
before
his
chateau
and
he
said
children
we
have
been
overcome
by
treachery
but
we
shall
meet
again
up
above
in
the
country
of
the
brave
protect
my
child
i
leave
him
in
your
care
live
napoleon
ii
he
had
thought
of
killing
himself
so
that
no
one
should
behold
napoleon
after
his
defeat
like
jesus
christ
before
the
crucifixion
he
thought
himself
forsaken
by
god
and
by
his
talisman
and
so
he
took
enough
poison
to
kill
a
regiment
but
it
had
no
effect
whatever
upon
him
another
marvel
he
discovered
that
he
was
immortal
and
feeling
sure
of
his
case
and
knowing
that
he
would
be
emperor
for
ever
he
went
to
an
island
for
a
little
while
so
as
to
study
the
dispositions
of
those
folk
who
did
not
fail
to
make
blunder
upon
blunder
whilst
he
was
biding
his
time
the
chinese
and
the
brutes
out
in
africa
the
moors
and
awkward
customers
all
of
them
were
so
convinced
that
he
was
something
more
than
mortal
that
they
respected
his
flag
saying
that
god
would
be
displeased
if
any
one
meddled
with
it
so
he
reigned
over
all
the
rest
of
the
world
although
the
doors
of
his
own
france
had
been
closed
upon
him
then
he
goes
on
board
the
same
nutshell
of
a
skiff
that
he
sailed
in
from
egypt
passes
under
the
noses
of
the
english
vessels
and
sets
foot
in
france
france
recognizes
her
emperor
the
cuckoo
flits
from
steeple
to
steeple
france
cries
with
one
voice
long
live
the
emperor
the
enthusiasm
for
that
wonder
of
the
ages
was
thoroughly
genuine
in
these
parts
dauphine
behaved
handsomely
and
i
was
uncommonly
pleased
to
learn
that
people
here
shed
tears
of
joy
on
seeing
his
gray
overcoat
once
more
it
was
on
march
that
napoleon
set
out
with
two
hundred
men
to
conquer
the
kingdom
of
france
and
navarre
which
by
march
had
become
the
french
empire
again
on
that
day
he
found
himself
in
paris
and
a
clean
sweep
had
been
made
of
everything
he
had
won
back
his
beloved
france
and
had
called
all
his
soldiers
about
him
again
and
three
words
of
his
had
done
it
all
here
am
i
twas
the
greatest
miracle
god
ever
worked
was
it
ever
known
in
the
world
before
that
a
man
should
do
nothing
but
show
his
hat
and
a
whole
empire
became
his
they
fancied
that
france
was
crushed
did
they
never
a
bit
of
it
a
national
army
springs
up
again
at
the
sight
of
the
eagle
and
we
all
march
to
waterloo
there
the
guard
fall
all
as
one
man
napoleon
in
his
despair
heads
the
rest
and
flings
himself
three
times
on
the
enemy
s
guns
without
finding
the
death
he
sought
we
all
saw
him
do
it
we
soldiers
and
the
day
was
lost
that
night
the
emperor
calls
all
his
old
soldiers
about
him
and
there
on
the
battlefield
which
was
soaked
with
our
blood
he
burns
his
flags
and
his
eagles
the
poor
eagles
that
had
never
been
defeated
that
had
cried
forward
in
battle
after
battle
and
had
flown
above
us
all
over
europe
that
was
the
end
of
the
eagles
all
the
wealth
of
england
could
not
purchase
for
her
one
the
rest
is
sufficiently
known
the
red
man
went
over
to
the
bourbons
like
the
low
scoundrel
he
is
france
is
prostrate
the
soldier
counts
for
nothing
they
rob
him
of
his
due
send
him
about
his
business
and
fill
his
place
with
nobles
who
could
not
walk
they
were
so
old
so
that
it
made
you
sorry
to
see
them
they
seize
napoleon
by
treachery
the
english
shut
him
up
on
a
desert
island
in
the
ocean
on
a
rock
ten
thousand
feet
above
the
rest
of
the
world
that
is
the
final
end
of
it
there
he
has
to
stop
till
the
red
man
gives
him
back
his
power
again
for
the
happiness
of
france
a
lot
of
them
say
that
he
is
dead
dead
oh
yes
very
likely
they
do
not
know
him
that
is
plain
they
go
on
telling
that
fib
to
deceive
the
people
and
to
keep
things
quiet
for
their
government
listen
this
is
the
whole
truth
of
the
matter
his
friends
have
left
him
alone
in
the
desert
to
fulfil
a
prophecy
that
was
made
about
him
for
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
his
name
napoleon
really
means
the
of
the
and
that
is
gospel
truth
you
will
hear
plenty
of
other
things
said
about
the
emperor
but
they
are
all
monstrous
nonsense
because
look
you
to
no
man
of
woman
born
would
god
have
given
the
power
to
write
his
name
in
red
as
he
did
across
the
earth
where
he
will
be
remembered
for
ever
long
live
napoleon
the
father
of
the
soldier
the
father
of
the
people
long
live
general
eble
cried
the
pontooner
how
did
you
manage
not
to
die
in
the
gorge
of
the
redoubts
at
borodino
asked
a
peasant
woman
do
i
know
we
were
a
whole
regiment
when
we
went
down
into
it
and
only
a
hundred
foot
were
left
standing
only
infantry
could
have
carried
it
for
the
infantry
look
you
is
everything
in
an
army
but
how
about
the
cavalry
cried
genestas
slipping
down
out
of
the
hay
in
a
sudden
fashion
that
drew
a
startled
cry
from
the
boldest
he
old
boy
you
are
forgetting
poniatowski
s
red
lancers
the
cuirassiers
the
dragoons
and
the
whole
boiling
whenever
napoleon
grew
tired
of
seeing
his
battalions
gain
no
ground
towards
the
end
of
a
victory
he
would
say
to
murat
here
you
cut
them
in
two
for
me
and
we
set
out
first
at
a
trot
and
then
at
a
gallop
and
cut
a
way
clean
through
the
ranks
of
the
enemy
it
was
like
slicing
an
apple
in
two
with
a
knife
why
a
charge
of
cavalry
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
column
of
cannon
and
how
about
the
pontooners
cried
the
deaf
veteran
there
there
my
children
genestas
went
on
repenting
in
his
confusion
of
the
sally
he
had
made
when
he
found
himself
in
the
middle
of
a
silent
and
bewildered
group
there
are
no
agents
of
police
spying
here
here
drink
to
the
little
corporal
with
this
long
live
the
emperor
all
cried
with
one
voice
hush
children
said
the
officer
concealing
his
own
deep
sorrow
with
an
effort
hush
is
he
died
saying
france
and
so
it
had
to
be
children
he
must
die
but
his
memory
never
goguelat
made
an
incredulous
gesture
then
he
whispered
to
those
about
him
the
officer
is
still
in
the
service
and
orders
have
been
issued
that
they
are
to
tell
the
people
that
the
emperor
is
dead
you
must
not
think
any
harm
of
him
because
after
all
a
soldier
must
obey
as
genestas
went
out
of
the
barn
he
heard
la
fosseuse
say
that
officer
you
know
is
benassis
friend
and
a
friend
of
the
emperor
every
soul
in
the
barn
rushed
to
the
door
to
see
the
commandant
again
they
saw
him
in
the
moonlight
as
he
took
the
doctor
s
arm
it
was
a
stupid
thing
to
do
said
genestas
quick
let
us
go
into
the
house
those
eagles
cannon
and
campaigns
i
had
quite
forgotten
where
i
well
what
do
you
think
of
our
goguelat
asked
benassis
so
long
as
such
stories
are
told
in
france
sir
she
will
always
find
the
fourteen
armies
of
the
republic
within
her
at
need
and
her
cannon
will
be
perfectly
able
to
keep
up
a
conversation
with
the
rest
of
europe
that
is
what
i
a
few
moments
later
they
reached
benassis
dwelling
and
soon
were
sitting
on
either
side
of
the
hearth
in
the
salon
the
dying
fire
in
the
grate
still
sent
up
a
few
sparks
now
and
then
each
was
absorbed
in
thought
genestas
was
hesitating
to
ask
one
last
question
in
spite
of
the
marks
of
confidence
that
he
had
received
he
feared
lest
the
doctor
should
regard
his
inquiry
as
indiscreet
he
looked
searchingly
at
benassis
more
than
once
and
an
answering
smile
full
of
a
kindly
cordiality
such
as
lights
up
the
faces
of
men
of
real
strength
of
character
seemed
to
give
him
in
advance
the
favorable
reply
for
which
he
sought
so
he
spoke
your
life
sir
is
so
different
from
the
lives
of
ordinary
men
that
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
hear
me
ask
you
the
reason
of
your
retired
existence
my
curiosity
may
seem
to
you
to
be
unmannerly
but
you
will
admit
that
it
is
very
natural
listen
a
moment
i
have
had
comrades
with
whom
i
have
never
been
on
intimate
terms
even
though
i
have
made
many
campaigns
with
them
but
there
have
been
others
to
whom
i
would
say
go
to
the
paymaster
and
draw
our
money
three
days
after
we
had
got
drunk
together
a
thing
that
will
happen
for
the
quietest
folk
must
have
a
frolic
fit
at
times
well
then
you
are
one
of
those
people
whom
i
take
for
a
friend
without
waiting
to
ask
leave
nay
without
so
much
as
knowing
captain
bluteau
whenever
the
doctor
had
called
his
guest
by
his
assumed
name
the
latter
had
been
unable
for
some
time
past
to
suppress
a
slight
grimace
benassis
happening
to
look
up
just
then
caught
this
expression
of
repugnance
he
sought
to
discover
the
reason
of
it
and
looked
full
into
the
soldier
s
face
but
the
real
enigma
was
insoluble
for
him
so
he
set
down
these
symptoms
to
physical
suffering
and
went
on
captain
i
am
about
to
speak
of
myself
i
have
had
to
force
myself
to
do
so
already
several
times
since
yesterday
while
telling
you
about
the
improvements
that
i
have
managed
to
introduce
here
but
it
was
a
question
of
the
interests
of
the
people
and
the
commune
with
which
mine
are
necessarily
bound
up
but
now
if
i
tell
you
my
story
i
should
have
to
speak
wholly
of
myself
and
mine
has
not
been
a
very
interesting
if
it
were
as
uneventful
as
la
fosseuse
s
life
answered
genestas
i
should
still
be
glad
to
know
about
it
i
should
like
to
know
the
untoward
events
that
could
bring
a
man
of
your
calibre
into
this
captain
for
these
twelve
years
i
have
lived
in
silence
and
now
as
i
wait
at
the
brink
of
the
grave
for
the
stroke
that
will
cast
me
into
it
i
will
candidly
own
to
you
that
this
silence
is
beginning
to
weigh
heavily
upon
me
i
have
borne
my
sorrows
alone
for
twelve
years
i
have
had
none
of
the
comfort
that
friendship
gives
in
such
full
measure
to
a
heart
in
pain
my
poor
sick
folk
and
my
peasants
certainly
set
me
an
example
of
unmurmuring
resignation
but
they
know
that
i
at
least
understand
them
and
their
troubles
while
there
is
not
a
soul
here
who
knows
of
the
tears
that
i
have
shed
no
one
to
give
me
the
of
a
comrade
the
noblest
reward
of
all
a
reward
that
falls
to
the
lot
of
every
other
even
gondrin
has
not
missed
genestas
held
out
his
hand
a
sudden
impulsive
movement
by
which
benassis
was
deeply
touched
there
is
la
fosseuse
he
went
on
in
a
different
voice
she
perhaps
would
have
understood
as
the
angels
might
but
then
too
she
might
possibly
have
loved
me
and
that
would
have
been
a
misfortune
listen
captain
my
confession
could
only
be
made
to
an
old
soldier
who
looks
as
leniently
as
you
do
on
the
failings
of
others
or
to
some
young
man
who
has
not
lost
the
illusions
of
youth
for
only
a
man
who
knows
life
well
or
a
lad
to
whom
it
is
all
unknown
could
understand
my
story
the
captains
of
past
times
who
fell
upon
the
field
of
battle
used
to
make
their
last
confession
to
the
cross
on
the
hilt
of
their
sword
if
there
was
no
priest
at
hand
it
was
the
sword
that
received
and
kept
the
last
confidences
between
a
human
soul
and
god
and
will
you
hear
and
understand
me
for
you
are
one
of
napoleon
s
finest
as
thoroughly
tempered
and
as
strong
as
steel
some
parts
of
my
story
can
only
be
understood
by
a
delicate
tenderness
and
through
a
sympathy
with
the
beliefs
that
dwell
in
simple
hearts
beliefs
which
would
seem
absurd
to
the
sophisticated
people
who
make
use
in
their
own
lives
of
the
prudential
maxims
of
worldly
wisdom
that
only
apply
to
the
government
of
states
to
you
i
shall
speak
openly
and
without
reserve
as
a
man
who
does
not
seek
to
apologize
for
his
life
with
the
good
and
evil
done
in
the
course
of
it
as
one
who
will
hide
nothing
from
you
because
he
lives
so
far
from
the
world
of
careless
of
the
judgements
of
man
and
full
of
hope
in
benassis
stopped
rose
to
his
feet
and
said
before
i
begin
my
story
i
will
order
tea
jacquotte
has
never
missed
asking
me
if
i
will
take
it
for
these
twelve
years
past
and
she
will
certainly
interrupt
us
do
you
care
about
it
captain
no
thank
in
another
moment
benassis
returned
chapter
iv
the
country
doctor
s
confession
i
was
born
in
a
little
town
in
languedoc
the
doctor
resumed
my
father
had
been
settled
there
for
many
years
and
there
my
early
childhood
was
spent
when
i
was
eight
years
old
i
was
sent
to
the
school
of
the
oratorians
at
sorreze
and
only
left
it
to
finish
my
studies
in
paris
my
father
had
squandered
his
patrimony
in
the
course
of
an
exceedingly
wild
and
extravagant
youth
he
had
retrieved
his
position
partly
by
a
fortunate
marriage
partly
by
the
slow
persistent
thrift
characteristic
of
provincial
life
for
in
the
provinces
people
pride
themselves
on
accumulating
rather
than
on
spending
and
all
the
ambition
in
a
man
s
nature
is
either
extinguished
or
directed
to
for
want
of
any
nobler
end
so
he
had
grown
rich
at
last
and
thought
to
transmit
to
his
only
son
all
the
experience
which
he
himself
had
purchased
at
the
price
of
his
lost
illusions
a
noble
last
illusion
of
age
which
fondly
seeks
to
bequeath
its
virtues
and
its
wary
prudence
to
heedless
youth
intent
only
on
the
enjoyment
of
the
enchanted
life
that
lies
before
it
this
foresight
on
my
father
s
part
led
him
to
make
plans
for
my
education
for
which
i
had
to
suffer
he
sedulously
concealed
my
expectations
of
wealth
from
me
and
during
the
fairest
years
of
my
youth
compelled
me
for
my
own
good
to
endure
the
burden
of
anxiety
and
hardship
that
presses
upon
a
young
man
who
has
his
own
way
to
make
in
the
world
his
idea
in
so
doing
was
to
instill
the
virtues
of
poverty
into
me
patience
a
thirst
for
learning
and
a
love
of
work
for
its
own
sake
he
hoped
to
teach
me
to
set
a
proper
value
on
my
inheritance
by
letting
me
learn
in
this
way
all
that
it
costs
to
make
a
fortune
wherefore
as
soon
as
i
was
old
enough
to
understand
his
advice
he
urged
me
to
choose
a
profession
and
to
work
steadily
at
it
my
tastes
inclined
me
to
the
study
of
medicine
so
i
left
sorreze
after
ten
years
of
almost
monastic
discipline
of
the
oratorians
and
fresh
from
the
quiet
life
of
a
remote
provincial
school
i
was
taken
straight
to
the
capital
my
father
went
with
me
in
order
to
introduce
me
to
the
notice
of
a
friend
of
his
and
all
unknown
to
me
my
two
elders
took
the
most
elaborate
precautions
against
any
ebullitions
of
youth
on
my
part
innocent
lad
though
i
was
my
allowance
was
rigidly
computed
on
a
scale
based
upon
the
absolute
necessaries
of
life
and
i
was
obliged
to
produce
my
certificate
of
attendance
at
the
ecole
de
medecine
before
i
was
allowed
to
draw
my
quarter
s
income
the
excuse
for
this
sufficiently
humiliating
distrust
was
the
necessity
of
my
acquiring
methodical
and
habits
my
father
however
was
not
sparing
of
money
for
all
the
necessary
expenses
of
my
education
and
for
the
amusements
of
parisian
life
his
old
friend
was
delighted
to
have
a
young
man
to
guide
through
the
labyrinth
into
which
i
had
entered
he
was
one
of
those
men
whose
natures
lead
them
to
docket
their
thoughts
feelings
and
opinions
every
whit
as
carefully
as
their
papers
he
would
turn
up
last
year
s
memorandum
book
and
could
tell
in
a
moment
what
he
had
been
doing
a
twelvemonth
since
in
this
very
month
day
and
hour
of
the
present
year
life
for
him
was
a
business
enterprise
and
he
kept
the
books
after
the
most
approved
business
methods
there
was
real
worth
in
him
though
he
might
be
punctilious
shrewd
and
suspicious
and
though
he
never
lacked
specious
excuses
for
the
precautionary
measures
that
he
took
with
regard
to
me
he
used
to
buy
all
my
books
he
paid
for
my
lessons
and
once
when
the
fancy
took
me
to
learn
to
ride
the
good
soul
himself
found
me
out
a
went
thither
with
me
and
anticipated
my
wishes
by
putting
a
horse
at
my
disposal
whenever
i
had
a
holiday
in
spite
of
all
this
cautious
strategy
which
i
managed
to
defeat
as
soon
as
i
had
any
temptation
to
do
so
the
kind
old
man
was
a
second
father
to
me
my
friend
he
said
as
soon
as
he
surmised
that
i
should
break
away
altogether
from
my
leading
strings
unless
he
relaxed
them
young
folk
are
apt
to
commit
follies
which
draw
down
the
wrath
of
their
elders
upon
their
heads
and
you
may
happen
to
want
money
at
some
time
or
other
if
so
come
to
me
your
father
helped
me
nobly
once
upon
a
time
and
i
shall
always
have
a
few
crowns
to
spare
for
you
but
never
tell
any
lies
and
do
not
be
ashamed
to
own
to
your
faults
i
myself
was
young
once
we
shall
always
get
on
well
together
like
two
good
my
father
found
lodgings
for
me
with
some
quiet
people
in
the
latin
quarter
and
my
room
was
furnished
nicely
enough
but
this
first
taste
of
independence
my
father
s
kindness
and
the
which
he
seemed
to
be
exercising
for
me
brought
me
but
little
happiness
perhaps
the
value
of
liberty
can
not
be
known
until
it
has
been
experienced
and
the
memories
of
the
freedom
of
my
childhood
had
been
almost
effaced
by
the
irksome
and
dreary
life
at
school
from
which
my
spirits
had
scarcely
recovered
in
addition
to
this
my
father
had
urged
new
tasks
upon
me
so
that
altogether
paris
was
an
enigma
you
must
acquire
some
knowledge
of
its
pleasures
before
you
can
amuse
yourself
in
paris
my
real
position
therefore
was
quite
unchanged
save
that
my
new
was
a
much
larger
building
and
was
called
the
ecole
de
medecine
nevertheless
i
studied
away
bravely
at
first
i
attended
lectures
diligently
i
worked
desperately
hard
and
without
relaxation
so
strongly
was
my
imagination
affected
by
the
abundant
treasures
of
knowledge
to
be
gained
in
the
capital
but
very
soon
i
heedlessly
made
acquaintances
danger
lurks
hidden
beneath
the
rash
confiding
friendships
that
have
so
strong
a
charm
for
youth
and
gradually
i
was
drawn
into
the
dissipated
life
of
the
capital
i
became
an
enthusiastic
lover
of
the
theatre
and
with
my
craze
for
actors
and
the
play
the
work
of
my
demoralization
began
the
stage
in
a
great
metropolis
exerts
a
very
deadly
influence
over
the
young
they
never
quit
the
theatre
save
in
a
state
of
emotional
excitement
almost
always
beyond
their
power
to
control
society
and
the
law
seem
to
me
to
be
accessories
to
the
irregularities
brought
about
in
this
way
our
legislation
has
shut
its
eyes
so
to
speak
to
the
passions
that
torment
a
young
man
between
twenty
and
years
of
age
in
paris
he
is
assailed
by
temptations
of
every
kind
religion
may
preach
and
law
may
demand
that
he
should
walk
uprightly
but
all
his
surroundings
and
the
tone
of
those
about
him
are
so
many
incitements
to
evil
do
not
the
best
of
men
and
the
most
devout
women
there
look
upon
continence
as
ridiculous
the
great
city
in
fact
seems
to
have
set
herself
to
give
encouragement
to
vice
and
to
this
alone
for
a
young
man
finds
that
the
entrance
to
every
honorable
career
in
which
he
might
look
for
success
is
barred
by
hindrances
even
more
numerous
than
the
snares
that
are
continually
set
for
him
so
that
through
his
weaknesses
he
may
be
robbed
of
his
money
for
a
long
while
i
went
every
evening
to
some
theatre
and
little
by
little
i
fell
into
idle
ways
i
grew
more
and
more
slack
over
my
work
even
my
most
pressing
tasks
were
apt
to
be
put
off
till
the
morrow
and
before
very
long
there
was
an
end
of
my
search
after
knowledge
for
its
own
sake
i
did
nothing
more
than
the
work
which
was
absolutely
required
to
enable
me
to
get
through
the
examinations
that
must
be
passed
before
i
could
become
a
doctor
i
attended
the
public
lectures
but
i
no
longer
paid
any
attention
to
the
professors
who
in
my
opinion
were
a
set
of
dotards
i
had
already
broken
my
idols
i
became
a
parisian
to
be
brief
i
led
the
aimless
drifting
life
of
a
young
provincial
thrown
into
the
heart
of
a
great
city
still
retaining
some
good
and
true
feeling
still
clinging
more
or
less
to
the
observance
of
certain
rules
of
conduct
still
fighting
in
vain
against
the
debasing
influence
of
evil
examples
though
i
offered
but
a
feeble
resistance
for
the
enemy
had
accomplices
within
me
yes
sir
my
face
is
not
misleading
past
storms
have
plainly
left
their
traces
there
yet
since
i
had
drunk
so
deeply
of
the
pure
fountain
of
religion
in
my
early
youth
i
was
haunted
in
the
depths
of
my
soul
through
all
my
wanderings
by
an
ideal
of
moral
perfection
which
could
not
fail
one
day
to
bring
me
back
to
god
by
the
paths
of
weariness
and
remorse
is
not
he
who
feels
the
pleasures
of
earth
most
keenly
sure
to
be
attracted
soon
or
late
by
the
fruits
of
heaven
at
first
i
went
through
the
experience
more
or
less
vivid
that
always
comes
with
youth
the
countless
moments
of
exultation
the
unnumbered
transports
of
despair
sometimes
i
took
my
vehement
energy
of
feeling
for
a
resolute
will
and
my
powers
sometimes
at
the
mere
sight
of
some
trifling
obstacle
with
which
i
was
about
to
come
into
collision
i
was
far
more
cast
down
than
i
ought
to
have
been
then
i
would
devise
vast
plans
would
dream
of
glory
and
betake
myself
to
work
but
a
pleasure
party
would
divert
me
from
the
noble
projects
based
on
so
infirm
a
purpose
vague
recollections
of
these
great
abortive
schemes
of
mine
left
a
deceptive
glow
in
my
soul
and
fostered
my
belief
in
myself
without
giving
me
the
energy
to
produce
in
my
indolent
i
was
in
a
very
fair
way
to
become
a
fool
for
what
is
a
fool
but
a
man
who
fails
to
justify
the
excellent
opinion
which
he
has
formed
of
himself
my
energy
was
directed
towards
no
definite
aims
i
wished
for
the
flowers
of
life
without
the
toil
of
cultivating
them
i
had
no
idea
of
the
obstacles
so
i
imagined
that
everything
was
easy
luck
i
thought
accounted
for
success
in
science
and
in
business
and
genius
was
charlatanism
i
took
it
for
granted
that
i
should
be
a
great
man
because
there
was
the
power
of
becoming
one
within
me
so
i
discounted
all
my
future
glory
without
giving
a
thought
to
the
patience
required
for
the
conception
of
a
great
work
nor
of
the
execution
in
the
course
of
which
all
the
difficulties
of
the
task
appear
the
sources
of
my
amusements
were
soon
exhausted
the
charm
of
the
theatre
does
not
last
for
very
long
and
for
a
poor
student
paris
shortly
became
an
empty
wilderness
they
were
dull
and
uninteresting
people
that
i
met
with
in
the
circle
of
the
family
with
whom
i
lived
but
these
and
an
old
man
who
had
now
lost
touch
with
the
world
were
all
the
society
that
i
had
so
like
every
young
man
who
takes
a
dislike
to
the
career
marked
out
for
him
i
rambled
about
the
streets
for
whole
days
together
i
strolled
along
the
quays
through
the
museums
and
public
gardens
making
no
attempt
to
arrive
at
a
clear
understanding
of
my
position
and
without
a
single
definite
idea
in
my
head
the
burden
of
unemployed
energies
is
more
felt
at
that
age
than
at
any
other
there
is
such
an
abundance
of
vitality
running
to
waste
so
much
activity
without
result
i
had
no
idea
of
the
power
that
a
resolute
will
puts
into
the
hands
of
a
man
in
his
youth
for
when
he
has
ideas
and
puts
his
whole
heart
and
soul
into
the
work
of
carrying
them
out
his
strength
is
yet
further
increased
by
the
undaunted
courage
of
youthful
convictions
childhood
in
its
simplicity
knows
nothing
of
the
perils
of
life
youth
sees
both
its
vastness
and
its
difficulties
and
at
the
prospect
the
courage
of
youth
sometimes
flags
we
are
still
serving
our
apprenticeship
to
life
we
are
new
to
the
business
a
kind
of
overpowers
us
and
leaves
us
in
an
almost
dazed
condition
of
mind
we
feel
that
we
are
helpless
aliens
in
a
strange
country
at
all
ages
we
shrink
back
involuntarily
from
the
unknown
and
a
young
man
is
very
much
like
the
soldier
who
will
walk
up
to
the
cannon
s
mouth
and
is
put
to
flight
by
a
ghost
he
hesitates
among
the
maxims
of
the
world
the
rules
of
attack
and
of
are
alike
unknown
to
him
he
can
neither
give
nor
take
he
is
attracted
by
women
and
stands
in
awe
of
them
his
very
good
qualities
tell
against
him
he
is
all
generosity
and
modesty
and
completely
innocent
of
mercenary
designs
pleasure
and
not
interest
is
his
object
when
he
tells
a
lie
and
among
many
dubious
courses
the
conscience
with
which
as
yet
he
has
not
juggled
points
out
to
him
the
right
way
which
he
is
slow
to
take
there
are
men
whose
lives
are
destined
to
be
shaped
by
the
impulses
of
their
hearts
rather
than
by
any
reasoning
process
that
takes
place
in
their
heads
and
such
natures
as
these
will
remain
for
a
long
while
in
the
position
that
i
have
described
this
was
my
own
case
i
became
the
plaything
of
two
contending
impulses
the
desires
of
youth
were
always
held
in
check
by
a
sentimentality
life
in
paris
is
a
cruel
ordeal
for
impressionable
natures
the
great
inequalities
of
fortune
or
of
position
inflame
their
souls
and
stir
up
bitter
feelings
in
that
world
of
magnificence
and
pettiness
envy
is
more
apt
to
be
a
dagger
than
a
spur
you
are
bound
either
to
fall
a
victim
or
to
become
a
partisan
in
this
incessant
strife
of
ambitions
desires
and
hatreds
in
the
midst
of
which
you
are
placed
and
by
slow
degrees
the
picture
of
vice
triumphant
and
virtue
made
ridiculous
produces
its
effect
on
a
young
man
and
he
wavers
life
in
paris
soon
rubs
the
bloom
from
conscience
the
infernal
work
of
demoralization
has
begun
and
is
soon
accomplished
the
first
of
pleasures
that
which
at
the
outset
comprehends
all
the
others
is
set
about
with
such
perils
that
it
is
impossible
not
to
reflect
upon
the
least
actions
which
it
provokes
impossible
not
to
calculate
all
its
consequences
these
calculations
lead
to
selfishness
if
some
poor
student
carried
away
by
an
impassioned
enthusiasm
is
fain
to
rise
above
selfish
considerations
the
suspicious
attitude
of
those
about
him
makes
him
pause
and
doubt
it
is
so
hard
not
to
share
their
mistrust
so
difficult
not
to
be
on
his
guard
against
his
own
generous
thoughts
his
heart
is
seared
and
contracted
by
this
struggle
the
current
of
life
sets
toward
the
brain
and
the
callousness
of
the
parisian
is
the
result
the
condition
of
things
in
which
schemes
for
power
and
wealth
are
concealed
by
the
most
charming
frivolity
and
lurk
beneath
the
sentimental
transports
that
take
the
place
of
enthusiasm
the
woman
in
paris
always
keeps
a
clear
head
even
in
the
intoxication
of
happiness
this
atmosphere
was
bound
to
affect
my
opinions
and
my
conduct
the
errors
that
have
poisoned
my
life
would
have
lain
lightly
on
many
a
conscience
but
we
in
the
south
have
a
religious
faith
that
leads
us
to
believe
in
a
future
life
and
in
the
truths
set
forth
by
the
catholic
church
these
beliefs
give
depth
and
gravity
to
every
feeling
and
to
remorse
a
terrible
and
lasting
power
the
army
were
masters
of
society
at
the
time
when
i
was
studying
medicine
in
order
to
shine
in
women
s
eyes
one
had
to
be
a
colonel
at
the
very
least
a
poor
student
counted
for
absolutely
nothing
goaded
by
the
strength
of
my
desires
and
finding
no
outlet
for
them
hampered
at
every
step
and
in
every
wish
by
the
want
of
money
looking
on
study
and
fame
as
too
slow
a
means
of
arriving
at
the
pleasures
that
tempted
me
drawn
one
way
by
my
inward
scruples
and
another
by
evil
examples
meeting
with
every
facility
for
low
dissipation
and
finding
nothing
but
hindrances
barring
the
way
to
good
society
i
passed
my
days
in
wretchedness
overwhelmed
by
a
surging
tumult
of
desires
and
by
indolence
of
the
most
deadly
kind
utterly
cast
down
at
times
only
to
be
as
suddenly
elated
the
catastrophe
which
at
length
put
an
end
to
this
crisis
was
commonplace
enough
the
thought
of
troubling
the
peace
of
a
household
has
always
been
repugnant
to
me
and
not
only
so
i
could
not
dissemble
my
feelings
the
instinct
of
sincerity
was
too
strong
in
me
i
should
have
found
it
a
physical
impossibility
to
lead
a
life
of
glaring
falsity
there
is
for
me
but
little
attraction
in
pleasures
that
must
be
snatched
i
wish
for
full
consciousness
of
my
happiness
i
led
a
life
of
solitude
for
which
there
seemed
to
be
no
remedy
for
i
shrank
from
openly
vicious
courses
and
the
many
efforts
that
i
made
to
enter
society
were
all
in
vain
there
i
might
have
met
with
some
woman
who
would
have
undertaken
the
task
of
teaching
me
the
perils
of
every
path
who
would
have
formed
my
manners
counseled
me
without
wounding
my
vanity
and
introduced
me
everywhere
where
i
was
likely
to
make
friends
who
would
be
useful
to
me
in
my
future
career
in
my
despair
an
intrigue
of
the
most
dangerous
kind
would
perhaps
have
had
its
attractions
for
me
but
even
peril
was
out
of
my
reach
my
inexperience
sent
me
back
again
to
my
solitude
where
i
dwelt
face
to
face
with
my
thwarted
desires
at
last
i
formed
a
connection
at
first
a
secret
one
with
a
girl
whom
i
persuaded
half
against
her
will
to
share
my
life
her
people
were
worthy
folk
who
had
but
small
means
it
was
not
very
long
before
she
left
her
simple
sheltered
life
and
fearlessly
intrusted
me
with
a
future
that
virtue
would
have
made
happy
and
fair
thinking
no
doubt
that
my
narrow
income
was
the
surest
guarantee
of
my
faithfulness
to
her
from
that
moment
the
tempest
that
had
raged
within
me
ceased
and
happiness
lulled
my
wild
desires
and
ambitions
to
sleep
such
happiness
is
only
possible
for
a
young
man
who
is
ignorant
of
the
world
who
knows
nothing
as
yet
of
its
accepted
codes
nor
of
the
strength
of
prejudice
but
while
it
lasts
his
happiness
is
as
as
a
child
s
is
not
first
love
like
a
return
of
childhood
across
the
intervening
years
of
anxiety
and
toil
there
are
men
who
learn
life
at
a
glance
who
see
it
for
what
it
is
at
once
who
learn
experience
from
the
mistakes
of
others
who
apply
the
current
maxims
of
worldly
wisdom
to
their
own
case
with
signal
success
and
make
unerring
forecasts
at
all
times
wise
in
their
generation
are
such
cool
heads
as
these
but
there
is
also
a
luckless
race
endowed
with
the
impressionable
temperament
of
the
poet
these
are
the
natures
that
fall
into
error
and
to
this
latter
class
i
belonged
there
was
no
great
depth
in
the
feeling
that
first
drew
me
towards
this
poor
girl
i
followed
my
instinct
rather
than
my
heart
when
i
sacrificed
her
to
myself
and
i
found
no
lack
of
excellent
reasons
wherewith
to
persuade
myself
that
there
was
no
harm
whatever
in
what
i
had
done
and
as
for
her
she
was
devotion
itself
a
noble
soul
with
a
clear
keen
intelligence
and
a
heart
of
gold
she
never
counseled
me
other
than
wisely
her
love
put
fresh
heart
into
me
from
the
first
she
foretold
a
splendid
future
of
success
and
fortune
for
me
and
gently
constrained
me
to
take
up
my
studies
again
by
her
belief
in
me
in
these
days
there
is
scarcely
a
branch
of
science
that
has
no
bearing
upon
medicine
it
is
a
difficult
task
to
achieve
distinction
but
the
reward
is
great
for
in
paris
fame
always
means
fortune
the
unselfish
girl
devoted
herself
to
me
shared
in
every
interest
even
the
slightest
of
my
life
and
managed
so
carefully
and
wisely
that
we
lived
in
comfort
on
my
narrow
income
i
had
more
money
to
spare
now
that
there
were
two
of
us
than
i
had
ever
had
while
i
lived
by
myself
those
were
my
happiest
days
i
worked
with
enthusiasm
i
had
a
definite
aim
before
me
i
had
found
the
encouragement
i
needed
everything
i
did
or
thought
i
carried
to
her
who
had
not
only
found
the
way
to
gain
my
love
but
above
and
beyond
this
had
filled
me
with
sincere
respect
for
her
by
the
modest
discretion
which
she
displayed
in
a
position
where
discretion
and
modesty
seemed
impossible
but
one
day
was
like
another
sir
and
it
is
only
after
our
hears
have
passed
through
all
the
storms
appointed
for
us
that
we
know
the
value
of
a
monotonous
happiness
and
learn
that
life
holds
nothing
more
sweet
for
us
than
this
a
calm
happiness
in
which
the
fatigue
of
existence
is
felt
no
longer
and
the
inmost
thoughts
of
either
find
response
in
the
other
s
soul
my
former
dreams
assailed
me
again
they
were
my
own
vehement
longings
for
the
pleasures
of
wealth
that
awoke
though
it
was
in
love
s
name
that
i
now
asked
for
them
in
the
evenings
i
grew
abstracted
and
moody
rapt
in
imaginings
of
the
pleasures
i
could
enjoy
if
i
were
rich
and
thoughtlessly
gave
expression
to
my
desires
in
answer
to
a
tender
questioning
voice
i
must
have
drawn
a
painful
sigh
from
her
who
had
devoted
herself
to
my
happiness
for
she
sweet
soul
felt
nothing
more
cruelly
than
the
thought
that
i
wished
for
something
that
she
could
not
give
me
immediately
oh
sir
a
woman
s
devotion
is
sublime
there
was
a
sharp
distress
in
the
doctor
s
exclamation
which
seemed
prompted
by
some
recollection
of
his
own
he
paused
for
a
brief
while
and
genestas
respected
his
musings
well
sir
benassis
resumed
something
happened
which
should
have
concluded
the
marriage
thus
begun
but
instead
of
that
it
put
an
end
to
it
and
was
the
cause
of
all
my
misfortunes
my
father
died
and
left
me
a
large
fortune
the
necessary
business
arrangements
demanded
my
presence
in
languedoc
for
several
months
and
i
went
thither
alone
at
last
i
had
regained
my
freedom
even
the
mildest
yoke
is
galling
to
youth
we
do
not
see
its
necessity
any
more
than
we
see
the
need
to
work
until
we
have
had
some
experience
of
life
i
came
and
went
without
giving
an
account
of
my
actions
to
any
one
there
was
no
need
to
do
so
now
unless
i
wished
and
i
relished
liberty
with
all
the
keen
capacity
for
enjoyment
that
we
have
in
languedoc
i
did
not
absolutely
forget
the
ties
that
bound
me
but
i
was
so
absorbed
in
other
matters
of
interest
that
my
mind
was
distracted
from
them
and
little
by
little
the
recollection
of
them
faded
away
letters
full
of
heartfelt
tenderness
reached
me
but
at
a
young
man
imagines
that
all
women
are
alike
tender
he
does
not
know
love
from
a
passing
infatuation
all
things
are
confused
in
the
sensations
of
pleasure
which
seem
at
first
to
comprise
everything
it
was
only
later
when
i
came
to
a
clearer
knowledge
of
men
and
of
things
as
they
are
that
i
could
estimate
those
noble
letters
at
their
just
worth
no
trace
of
selfishness
was
mingled
with
the
feeling
expressed
in
them
there
was
nothing
but
gladness
on
my
account
for
my
change
of
fortune
and
regret
on
her
own
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
i
could
change
towards
her
for
she
felt
that
she
herself
was
incapable
of
change
but
even
then
i
had
given
myself
up
to
ambitious
dreams
i
thought
of
drinking
deeply
of
all
the
delights
that
wealth
could
give
of
becoming
a
person
of
consequence
of
making
a
brilliant
marriage
so
i
read
the
letters
and
contented
myself
with
saying
she
is
very
fond
of
me
with
the
indifference
of
a
coxcomb
even
then
i
was
perplexed
as
to
how
to
extricate
myself
from
this
entanglement
i
was
ashamed
of
it
and
this
fact
as
well
as
my
perplexity
led
me
to
be
cruel
we
begin
by
wounding
the
victim
and
then
we
kill
it
that
the
sight
of
our
cruelty
may
no
longer
put
us
to
the
blush
late
reflections
upon
those
days
of
error
have
unveiled
for
me
many
a
dark
depth
in
the
human
heart
yes
believe
me
those
who
best
have
fathomed
the
good
and
evil
in
human
nature
have
honestly
examined
themselves
in
the
first
instance
conscience
is
the
of
our
investigations
we
proceed
from
ourselves
to
others
never
from
others
to
ourselves
when
i
returned
to
paris
i
took
up
my
abode
in
a
large
house
which
in
pursuance
with
my
orders
had
been
taken
for
me
and
the
one
person
interested
in
my
return
and
change
of
address
was
not
informed
of
it
i
wished
to
cut
a
figure
among
young
men
of
fashion
i
waited
a
few
days
to
taste
the
first
delights
of
wealth
and
when
flushed
with
the
excitement
of
my
new
position
i
felt
that
i
could
trust
myself
to
do
so
i
went
to
see
the
poor
girl
whom
i
meant
to
cast
off
with
a
woman
s
quickness
she
saw
what
was
passing
in
my
mind
and
hid
her
tears
from
me
she
could
not
but
have
despised
me
but
it
was
her
nature
to
be
gentle
and
kindly
and
she
never
showed
her
scorn
her
forbearance
was
a
cruel
punishment
an
unresisting
victim
is
not
a
pleasant
thing
whether
the
murder
is
done
decorously
in
the
or
brutally
on
the
highway
there
should
be
a
struggle
to
give
some
plausible
excuse
for
taking
a
life
i
renewed
my
visits
very
affectionately
at
first
making
efforts
to
be
gracious
if
not
tender
by
slow
degrees
i
became
politely
civil
and
one
day
by
a
sort
of
tacit
agreement
between
us
she
allowed
me
to
treat
her
as
a
stranger
and
i
thought
that
i
had
done
all
that
could
be
expected
of
me
nevertheless
i
abandoned
myself
to
my
new
life
with
almost
frenzied
eagerness
and
sought
to
drown
in
gaiety
any
vague
lingering
remorse
that
i
felt
a
man
who
has
lost
his
can
not
endure
his
own
society
so
i
led
the
dissipated
life
that
wealthy
young
men
lead
in
paris
owing
to
a
good
education
and
an
excellent
memory
i
seemed
cleverer
than
i
really
was
forthwith
i
looked
down
upon
other
people
and
those
who
for
their
own
purposes
wished
to
prove
to
me
that
i
was
possessed
of
extraordinary
abilities
found
me
quite
convinced
on
that
head
praise
is
the
most
insidious
of
all
methods
of
treachery
known
to
the
world
and
this
is
nowhere
better
understood
than
in
paris
where
intriguing
schemers
know
how
to
stifle
every
kind
of
talent
at
its
birth
by
heaping
laurels
on
its
cradle
so
i
did
nothing
worthy
of
my
reputation
i
reaped
no
advantages
from
the
golden
opinions
entertained
of
me
and
made
no
acquaintances
likely
to
be
useful
in
my
future
career
i
wasted
my
energies
in
numberless
frivolous
pursuits
and
in
the
love
intrigues
that
are
the
disgrace
of
salons
in
paris
where
every
one
seeks
for
love
grows
blase
in
the
pursuit
falls
into
the
libertinism
sanctioned
by
polite
society
and
ends
by
feeling
as
much
astonished
at
real
passion
as
the
world
is
over
a
heroic
action
i
did
as
others
did
often
i
dealt
to
generous
and
candid
souls
the
deadly
wound
from
which
i
myself
was
slowly
perishing
yet
though
deceptive
appearances
might
lead
others
to
misjudge
me
i
could
never
overcome
my
scrupulous
delicacy
many
times
i
have
been
duped
and
should
have
blushed
for
myself
had
it
been
otherwise
i
secretly
prided
myself
on
acting
in
good
faith
although
this
lowered
me
in
the
eyes
of
others
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
world
has
a
considerable
respect
for
cleverness
whatever
form
it
takes
and
success
justifies
everything
so
the
world
was
pleased
to
attribute
to
me
all
the
good
qualities
and
evil
propensities
all
the
victories
and
defeats
which
had
never
been
mine
credited
me
with
conquests
of
which
i
knew
nothing
and
sat
in
judgment
upon
actions
of
which
i
had
never
been
guilty
i
scorned
to
contradict
the
slanders
and
led
me
to
regard
the
more
flattering
rumors
with
a
certain
complacence
outwardly
my
existence
was
pleasant
enough
but
in
reality
i
was
miserable
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
tempest
of
misfortunes
that
very
soon
burst
over
my
head
all
good
impulses
must
have
perished
and
evil
would
have
triumphed
in
the
struggle
that
went
on
within
me
enervating
would
have
destroyed
the
body
as
the
detestable
habits
of
egotism
exhausted
the
springs
of
the
soul
but
i
was
ruined
financially
this
was
how
it
came
about
no
matter
how
large
his
fortune
may
be
a
man
is
sure
to
find
some
one
else
in
paris
possessed
of
yet
greater
wealth
whom
he
must
needs
aim
at
surpassing
in
this
unequal
conquest
i
was
vanquished
at
the
end
of
four
years
and
like
many
another
harebrained
youngster
i
was
obliged
to
sell
part
of
my
property
and
to
mortgage
the
remainder
to
satisfy
my
creditors
then
a
terrible
blow
suddenly
struck
me
down
two
years
had
passed
since
i
had
last
seen
the
woman
whom
i
had
deserted
the
turn
that
my
affairs
were
taking
would
no
doubt
have
brought
me
back
to
her
once
more
but
one
evening
in
the
midst
of
a
gay
circle
of
acquaintances
i
received
a
note
written
in
a
trembling
hand
it
only
contained
these
few
words
i
have
only
a
very
little
while
to
live
and
i
should
like
to
see
you
my
friend
so
that
i
may
know
what
will
become
of
my
child
whether
henceforward
he
will
be
yours
and
also
to
soften
the
regret
that
some
day
you
might
perhaps
feel
for
my
the
letter
made
me
shudder
it
was
a
revelation
of
secret
anguish
in
the
past
while
it
contained
a
whole
unknown
future
i
set
out
on
foot
i
would
not
wait
for
my
carriage
i
went
across
paris
goaded
by
remorse
and
gnawed
by
a
dreadful
fear
that
was
confirmed
by
the
first
sight
of
my
victim
in
the
extreme
neatness
and
cleanliness
beneath
which
she
had
striven
to
hid
her
poverty
i
read
all
the
terrible
sufferings
of
her
life
she
was
nobly
reticent
about
them
in
her
effort
to
spare
my
feelings
and
only
alluded
to
them
after
i
had
solemnly
promised
to
adopt
our
child
she
died
sir
in
spite
of
all
the
care
lavished
upon
her
and
all
that
science
could
suggest
was
done
for
her
in
vain
the
care
and
devotion
that
had
come
too
late
only
served
to
render
her
last
moments
less
bitter
to
support
her
little
one
she
had
worked
incessantly
with
her
needle
love
for
her
child
had
given
her
strength
to
endure
her
life
of
hardship
but
it
had
not
enabled
her
to
bear
my
desertion
the
keenest
of
all
her
griefs
many
times
she
had
thought
of
trying
to
see
me
but
her
woman
s
pride
had
always
prevented
this
while
i
squandered
floods
of
gold
upon
my
caprices
no
memory
of
the
past
had
ever
bidden
a
single
drop
to
fall
in
her
home
to
help
mother
and
child
to
live
but
she
had
been
content
to
weep
and
had
not
cursed
me
she
had
looked
upon
her
evil
fortune
as
the
natural
punishment
of
her
error
with
the
aid
of
a
good
priest
of
saint
sulpice
whose
kindly
voice
had
restored
peace
to
her
soul
she
had
sought
for
hope
in
the
shadow
of
the
altar
whither
she
had
gone
to
dry
her
tears
the
bitter
flood
that
i
had
poured
into
her
heart
gradually
abated
and
one
day
when
she
heard
her
child
say
father
a
word
that
she
had
not
taught
him
she
forgave
my
crime
but
sorrow
and
weeping
and
days
and
nights
of
ceaseless
toil
injured
her
health
religion
had
brought
its
consolations
and
the
courage
to
bear
the
ills
of
life
but
all
too
late
she
fell
ill
of
a
heart
complaint
brought
on
by
grief
and
by
the
strain
of
expectation
for
she
always
thought
that
i
should
return
and
her
hopes
always
sprang
up
afresh
after
every
disappointment
her
health
grew
worse
and
at
last
as
she
was
lying
on
her
deathbed
she
wrote
those
few
lines
containing
no
word
of
reproach
prompted
by
religion
and
by
a
belief
in
the
goodness
in
my
nature
she
knew
she
said
that
i
was
blinded
rather
than
bent
on
doing
wrong
she
even
accused
herself
of
carrying
her
womanly
pride
too
far
if
i
had
only
written
sooner
she
said
perhaps
there
might
have
been
time
for
a
marriage
which
would
have
legitimated
our
it
was
only
on
her
child
s
account
that
she
wished
for
the
solemnization
of
the
ties
that
bound
us
nor
would
she
have
sought
for
this
if
she
had
not
felt
that
death
was
at
hand
to
unloose
them
but
it
was
too
late
even
then
she
had
only
a
few
hours
to
live
by
her
bedside
where
i
learned
to
know
the
worth
of
a
devoted
heart
my
nature
underwent
a
final
change
i
was
still
at
an
age
when
tears
are
shed
during
those
last
days
while
the
precious
life
yet
lingered
my
tears
my
words
and
everything
i
did
bore
witness
to
my
heartstricken
repentance
the
meanness
and
pettiness
of
the
society
in
which
i
had
moved
the
emptiness
and
selfishness
of
women
of
fashion
had
taught
me
to
wish
for
and
to
seek
an
elect
soul
and
now
i
had
found
it
too
late
i
was
weary
of
lying
words
and
of
masked
faces
counterfeit
passion
had
set
me
dreaming
i
had
called
on
love
and
now
i
beheld
love
lying
before
me
slain
by
my
own
hands
and
had
no
power
to
keep
it
beside
me
no
power
to
keep
what
was
so
wholly
mine
the
experience
of
four
years
had
taught
me
to
know
my
own
real
character
my
temperament
the
nature
of
my
imagination
my
religious
principles
which
had
not
been
eradicated
but
had
rather
lain
dormant
my
turn
of
mind
my
heart
that
only
now
began
to
make
itself
felt
everything
within
me
led
me
to
resolve
to
fill
my
life
with
the
pleasures
of
affection
to
replace
a
lawless
love
by
family
happiness
the
truest
happiness
on
earth
visions
of
close
and
dear
companionship
appealed
to
me
but
the
more
strongly
for
my
wanderings
in
the
wilderness
my
grasping
at
pleasures
unennobled
by
thought
or
feeling
so
though
the
revolution
within
me
was
rapidly
effected
it
was
permanent
with
my
southern
temperament
warped
by
the
life
i
led
in
paris
i
should
certainly
have
come
to
look
without
pity
on
an
unhappy
girl
betrayed
by
her
lover
i
should
have
laughed
at
the
story
if
it
had
been
told
me
by
some
wag
in
merry
company
for
with
us
in
france
a
clever
bon
mot
dispels
all
feelings
of
horror
at
a
crime
but
all
sophistries
were
silenced
in
the
presence
of
this
angelic
creature
against
whom
i
could
bring
no
least
word
of
reproach
there
stood
her
coffin
and
my
child
who
did
not
know
that
i
had
murdered
his
mother
and
smiled
at
me
she
died
she
died
happy
when
she
saw
that
i
loved
her
and
that
this
new
love
was
due
neither
to
pity
nor
to
the
ties
that
bound
us
together
never
shall
i
forget
her
last
hours
love
had
been
won
back
her
mind
was
at
rest
about
her
child
and
happiness
triumphed
over
suffering
the
comfort
and
luxury
about
her
the
merriment
of
her
child
who
looked
prettier
still
in
the
dainty
garb
that
had
replaced
his
were
pledges
of
a
happy
future
for
the
little
one
in
whom
she
saw
her
own
life
renewed
the
curate
of
saint
sulpice
witnessed
my
terrible
distress
his
words
made
me
despair
he
did
not
attempt
to
offer
conventional
consolation
and
put
the
gravity
of
my
responsibilities
unsparingly
before
me
but
i
had
no
need
of
a
spur
the
conscience
within
me
spoke
loudly
enough
already
a
woman
had
placed
a
generous
confidence
in
me
i
had
lied
to
her
from
the
first
i
had
told
her
that
i
loved
her
and
then
i
had
cast
her
off
i
had
brought
all
this
sorrow
upon
an
unhappy
girl
who
had
braved
the
opinion
of
the
world
for
me
and
who
therefore
should
have
been
sacred
in
my
eyes
she
had
died
forgiving
me
her
implicit
trust
in
the
word
of
a
man
who
had
once
before
broken
his
promise
to
her
effaced
the
memory
of
all
her
pain
and
grief
and
she
slept
in
peace
agatha
who
had
given
me
her
girlish
faith
had
found
in
her
heart
another
faith
to
give
me
the
faith
of
a
mother
oh
sir
the
child
child
god
alone
can
know
all
that
he
was
to
me
the
dear
little
one
was
like
his
mother
he
had
her
winning
grace
in
his
little
ways
his
talk
and
ideas
but
for
me
my
child
was
not
only
a
child
but
something
more
was
he
not
the
token
of
my
forgiveness
my
honor
he
should
have
more
than
a
father
s
affection
he
should
be
loved
as
his
mother
would
have
loved
him
my
remorse
might
change
to
happiness
if
i
could
only
make
him
feel
that
his
mother
s
arms
were
still
about
him
i
clung
to
him
with
all
the
force
of
human
love
and
the
hope
of
heaven
with
all
the
tenderness
in
my
heart
that
god
has
given
to
mothers
the
sound
of
the
child
s
voice
made
me
tremble
i
used
to
watch
him
while
he
slept
with
a
sense
of
gladness
that
was
always
new
albeit
a
tear
sometimes
fell
on
his
forehead
i
taught
him
to
come
to
say
his
prayer
upon
my
bed
as
soon
as
he
awoke
how
sweet
and
touching
were
the
simple
words
of
the
in
the
innocent
childish
mouth
ah
and
at
times
how
terrible
father
which
art
in
he
began
one
morning
then
he
paused
why
is
it
not
he
asked
and
my
heart
sank
at
his
words
from
the
very
first
i
had
sown
the
seeds
of
future
misfortune
in
the
life
of
the
son
whom
i
idolized
although
the
law
has
almost
countenanced
errors
of
youth
by
conceding
to
tardy
regret
a
legal
status
to
natural
children
the
insurmountable
prejudices
of
society
bring
a
strong
force
to
the
support
of
the
reluctance
of
the
law
all
serious
reflection
on
my
part
as
to
the
foundations
and
mechanism
of
society
on
the
duties
of
man
and
vital
questions
of
morality
date
from
this
period
of
my
life
genius
comprehends
at
first
sight
the
connection
between
a
man
s
principles
and
the
fate
of
the
society
of
which
he
forms
a
part
devout
souls
are
inspired
by
religion
with
the
sentiments
necessary
for
their
happiness
but
vehement
and
impulsive
natures
can
only
be
schooled
by
repentance
with
repentance
came
new
light
for
me
and
i
who
only
lived
for
my
child
came
through
that
child
to
think
over
great
social
questions
i
determined
from
the
first
that
he
should
have
all
possible
means
of
success
within
himself
and
that
he
should
be
thoroughly
prepared
to
take
the
high
position
for
which
i
destined
him
he
learned
english
german
italian
and
spanish
in
succession
and
that
he
might
speak
these
languages
correctly
tutors
belonging
to
each
of
these
various
nationalities
were
successively
placed
about
him
from
his
earliest
childhood
his
aptitude
delighted
me
i
took
advantage
of
it
to
give
him
lessons
in
the
guise
of
play
i
wished
to
keep
his
mind
free
from
fallacies
and
strove
before
all
things
to
accustom
him
from
childhood
to
exert
his
intellectual
powers
to
make
a
rapid
and
accurate
general
survey
of
a
matter
and
then
by
a
careful
study
of
every
least
particular
to
master
his
subject
in
detail
lastly
i
taught
him
to
submit
to
discipline
without
murmuring
i
never
allowed
an
impure
or
improper
word
to
be
spoken
in
his
hearing
i
was
careful
that
all
his
surroundings
and
the
men
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
should
conduce
to
one
end
to
ennoble
his
nature
to
set
lofty
ideals
before
him
to
give
him
a
love
of
truth
and
a
horror
of
lies
to
make
him
simple
and
natural
in
manner
as
in
word
and
deed
his
natural
aptitude
had
made
his
other
studies
easy
to
him
and
his
imagination
made
him
quick
to
grasp
these
lessons
that
lay
outside
the
province
of
the
schoolroom
what
a
fair
flower
to
tend
how
great
are
the
joys
that
mothers
know
in
those
days
i
began
to
understand
how
his
own
mother
had
been
able
to
live
and
to
bear
her
sorrow
this
sir
was
the
great
event
of
my
life
and
now
i
am
coming
to
the
tragedy
which
drove
me
hither
it
is
the
most
ordinary
commonplace
story
imaginable
but
to
me
it
meant
the
most
terrible
pain
for
some
years
i
had
thought
of
nothing
but
my
child
and
how
to
make
a
man
of
him
then
when
my
son
was
growing
up
and
about
to
leave
me
i
grew
afraid
of
my
loneliness
love
was
a
necessity
of
my
existence
this
need
for
affection
had
never
been
satisfied
and
only
grew
stronger
with
years
i
was
in
every
way
capable
of
a
real
attachment
i
had
been
tried
and
proved
i
knew
all
that
a
steadfast
love
means
the
love
that
delights
to
find
a
pleasure
in
in
everything
i
did
my
first
thought
would
always
be
for
the
woman
i
loved
in
imagination
i
was
fain
to
dwell
on
the
serene
heights
far
above
doubt
and
uncertainty
where
love
so
fills
two
beings
that
happiness
flows
quietly
and
evenly
into
their
life
their
looks
and
words
such
love
is
to
a
life
what
religion
is
to
the
soul
a
vital
force
a
power
that
enlightens
and
upholds
i
understood
the
love
of
husband
and
wife
in
nowise
as
most
people
do
for
me
its
full
beauty
and
magnificence
began
precisely
at
the
point
where
love
perishes
in
many
a
household
i
deeply
felt
the
moral
grandeur
of
a
life
so
closely
shared
by
two
souls
that
the
trivialities
of
everyday
existence
should
be
powerless
against
such
lasting
love
as
theirs
but
where
will
the
hearts
be
found
whose
beats
are
so
nearly
let
the
scientific
term
pass
that
they
may
attain
to
this
beatific
union
if
they
exist
nature
and
chance
have
set
them
far
apart
so
that
they
can
not
come
together
they
find
each
other
too
late
or
death
comes
too
soon
to
separate
them
there
must
be
some
good
reasons
for
these
dispensations
of
fate
but
i
have
never
sought
to
discover
them
i
can
not
make
a
study
of
my
wound
because
i
suffer
too
much
from
it
perhaps
perfect
happiness
is
a
monster
which
our
species
should
not
perpetuate
there
were
other
causes
for
my
fervent
desire
for
such
a
marriage
as
this
i
had
no
friends
the
world
for
me
was
a
desert
there
is
something
in
me
that
repels
friendship
more
than
one
person
has
sought
me
out
but
in
spite
of
efforts
on
my
part
it
came
to
nothing
with
many
men
i
have
been
careful
to
show
no
sign
of
something
that
is
called
superiority
i
have
adapted
my
mind
to
theirs
i
have
placed
myself
at
their
point
of
view
joined
in
their
laughter
and
overlooked
their
defects
any
fame
i
might
have
gained
i
would
have
bartered
for
a
little
kindly
affection
they
parted
from
me
without
regret
if
you
seek
for
real
feeling
in
paris
snares
await
you
everywhere
and
the
end
is
sorrow
wherever
i
set
my
foot
the
ground
round
about
me
seemed
to
burn
my
readiness
to
acquiesce
was
considered
weakness
though
if
i
unsheathed
my
talons
like
a
man
conscious
that
he
may
some
day
wield
the
thunderbolts
of
power
i
was
thought
to
others
the
delightful
laughter
that
ceases
with
youth
and
in
which
in
later
years
we
are
almost
ashamed
to
indulge
seemed
absurd
and
they
amused
themselves
at
my
expense
people
may
be
bored
nowadays
but
none
the
less
they
expect
you
to
treat
every
trivial
topic
with
befitting
seriousness
a
hateful
era
you
must
bow
down
before
mediocrity
frigidly
polite
mediocrity
which
you
despise
and
obey
on
more
mature
reflection
i
have
discovered
the
reasons
of
these
glaring
inconsistencies
mediocrity
is
never
out
of
fashion
it
is
the
daily
wear
of
society
genius
and
eccentricity
are
ornaments
that
are
locked
away
and
only
brought
out
on
certain
days
everything
that
ventures
forth
beyond
the
protection
of
the
grateful
shadow
of
mediocrity
has
something
startling
about
it
so
in
the
midst
of
paris
i
led
a
solitary
life
i
had
given
up
everything
to
society
but
it
had
given
me
nothing
in
return
and
my
child
was
not
enough
to
satisfy
my
heart
because
i
was
not
a
woman
my
life
seemed
to
be
growing
cold
within
me
i
was
bending
under
a
load
of
secret
misery
when
i
met
the
woman
who
was
to
make
me
know
the
might
of
love
the
reverence
of
an
acknowledged
love
love
with
its
teeming
hopes
of
happiness
in
one
word
love
i
had
renewed
my
acquaintance
with
that
old
friend
of
my
father
s
who
had
once
taken
charge
of
my
affairs
it
was
in
his
house
that
i
first
met
her
whom
i
must
love
as
long
as
life
shall
last
the
longer
we
live
sir
the
more
clearly
we
see
the
enormous
influence
of
ideas
upon
the
events
of
life
prejudices
worthy
of
all
respect
and
bred
by
noble
religious
ideas
occasioned
my
misfortunes
this
young
girl
belonged
to
an
exceeding
devout
family
whose
views
of
catholicism
were
due
to
the
spirit
of
a
sect
improperly
styled
jansenists
which
in
former
times
caused
troubles
in
france
you
know
why
no
said
genestas
jansenius
bishop
of
ypres
once
wrote
a
book
which
was
believed
to
contain
propositions
at
variance
with
the
doctrines
of
the
holy
see
when
examined
at
a
later
date
there
appeared
to
be
nothing
heretical
in
the
wording
of
the
text
some
authors
even
went
so
far
as
to
deny
that
the
heretical
propositions
had
any
real
existence
however
it
was
these
insignificant
disputes
gave
rise
to
two
parties
in
the
gallican
church
the
jansenists
and
the
jesuits
great
men
were
found
in
either
camp
and
a
struggle
began
between
two
powerful
bodies
the
jansenists
affected
an
excessive
purity
of
morals
and
of
doctrine
and
accused
the
jesuits
of
preaching
a
relaxed
morality
the
jansenists
in
fact
were
catholic
puritans
if
two
contradictory
terms
can
be
combined
during
the
revolution
the
concordat
occasioned
an
unimportant
schism
a
little
segregation
of
who
refused
to
recognize
the
bishops
appointed
by
the
authorities
with
the
consent
of
the
pope
this
little
body
of
the
faithful
was
called
the
little
church
and
those
within
its
fold
like
the
jansenists
led
the
strictly
ordered
lives
that
appear
to
be
a
first
necessity
of
existence
in
all
proscribed
and
persecuted
sects
many
jansenist
families
had
joined
the
little
church
the
family
to
which
this
young
girl
belonged
had
embraced
the
equally
rigid
doctrines
of
both
these
puritanisms
tenets
which
impart
a
stern
dignity
to
the
character
and
mien
of
those
who
hold
them
it
is
the
nature
of
positive
doctrine
to
exaggerate
the
importance
of
the
most
ordinary
actions
of
life
by
connecting
them
with
ideas
of
a
future
existence
this
is
the
source
of
a
splendid
and
delicate
purity
of
heart
a
respect
for
others
and
for
self
of
an
indescribably
keen
sense
of
right
and
wrong
a
wide
charity
together
with
a
justice
so
stern
that
it
might
well
be
called
inexorable
and
lastly
a
perfect
hatred
of
lies
and
of
all
the
vices
comprised
by
falsehood
i
can
recall
no
more
delightful
moments
than
those
of
our
first
meeting
at
my
old
friend
s
house
i
beheld
for
the
first
time
this
shy
young
girl
with
her
sincere
nature
her
habits
of
ready
obedience
all
the
virtues
peculiar
to
the
sect
to
which
she
belonged
shone
in
her
but
she
seemed
to
be
unconscious
of
her
merit
there
was
a
grace
which
no
austerity
could
diminish
about
every
movement
of
her
lissome
slender
form
her
quiet
brow
the
delicate
grave
outlines
of
her
face
and
her
clearly
cut
features
indicated
noble
birth
her
expression
was
gentle
and
proud
her
thick
hair
had
been
simply
braided
the
coronet
of
plaits
about
her
head
served
all
unknown
to
her
as
an
adornment
captain
she
was
for
me
the
ideal
type
that
is
always
made
real
for
us
in
the
woman
with
whom
we
fall
in
love
for
when
we
love
is
it
not
because
we
recognize
beauty
that
we
have
dreamed
of
the
beauty
that
has
existed
in
idea
for
us
is
realized
when
i
spoke
to
her
she
answered
simply
without
shyness
or
eagerness
she
did
not
know
the
pleasure
it
was
to
me
to
see
her
to
hear
the
musical
sounds
of
her
voice
all
these
angels
are
revealed
to
our
hearts
by
the
same
signs
by
the
sweetness
of
their
tongues
the
tenderness
in
their
eyes
by
their
fair
pale
faces
and
their
gracious
ways
all
these
things
are
so
blended
and
mingled
that
we
feel
the
charm
of
their
presence
yet
can
not
tell
in
what
that
charm
consists
and
every
movement
is
an
expression
of
a
divine
soul
within
i
loved
passionately
this
newly
awakened
love
satisfied
all
my
restless
longings
all
my
ambitious
dreams
she
was
beautiful
wealthy
and
nobly
born
she
had
been
carefully
brought
up
she
had
all
the
qualifications
which
the
world
positively
demands
of
a
woman
placed
in
the
high
position
which
i
desired
to
reach
she
had
been
well
educated
she
expressed
herself
with
a
sprightly
facility
at
once
rare
and
common
in
france
where
the
most
prettily
worded
phrases
of
many
women
are
emptiness
itself
while
her
bright
talk
was
full
of
sense
above
all
she
had
a
deep
consciousness
of
her
own
dignity
which
made
others
respect
her
i
know
of
no
more
excellent
thing
in
a
wife
i
must
stop
captain
no
one
can
describe
the
woman
he
loves
save
very
imperfectly
preexistent
mysteries
which
defy
analysis
lie
between
them
i
very
soon
took
my
old
friend
into
my
confidence
he
introduced
me
to
her
family
and
gave
me
the
countenance
of
his
honorable
character
i
was
received
at
first
with
the
frigid
politeness
characteristic
of
those
exclusive
people
who
never
forsake
those
whom
they
have
once
admitted
to
their
friendship
as
time
went
on
they
welcomed
me
almost
as
one
of
the
family
this
mark
of
their
esteem
was
won
by
my
behavior
in
the
matter
in
spite
of
my
passionate
love
i
did
nothing
that
could
lower
me
in
my
own
eyes
i
did
not
cringe
i
paid
no
court
to
those
upon
whom
my
fate
depended
before
all
things
i
showed
myself
a
man
and
not
other
than
i
really
was
when
i
was
well
known
to
them
my
old
friend
who
was
as
desirous
as
i
myself
that
my
life
of
melancholy
loneliness
should
come
to
an
end
spoke
of
my
hopes
and
met
with
a
favorable
reception
but
with
the
diplomatic
shrewdness
which
is
almost
a
second
nature
with
men
of
the
world
he
was
silent
with
regard
to
an
error
of
my
youth
as
he
termed
it
he
was
anxious
to
bring
about
a
satisfactory
marriage
for
me
an
expression
that
makes
of
so
solemn
an
act
a
business
transaction
in
which
husband
and
wife
endeavor
to
cheat
each
other
in
his
opinion
the
existence
of
my
child
would
excite
a
moral
repugnance
in
comparison
with
which
the
question
of
money
would
be
as
nought
and
the
whole
affair
would
be
broken
off
at
once
and
he
was
right
it
is
a
matter
which
will
be
very
easily
settled
between
you
and
your
wife
it
will
be
easy
to
obtain
her
full
and
free
forgiveness
he
said
in
short
he
tried
to
silence
my
scruples
and
all
the
insidious
arguments
that
worldly
wisdom
could
suggest
were
brought
to
bear
upon
me
to
this
end
i
will
confess
to
you
sir
that
in
spite
of
my
promise
my
first
impulse
was
to
act
straightforwardly
and
to
make
everything
known
to
the
head
of
the
family
but
the
thought
of
his
uncompromising
sternness
made
me
pause
and
the
probable
consequences
of
the
confession
appalled
me
my
courage
failed
i
temporized
with
my
conscience
i
determined
to
wait
until
i
was
sufficiently
sure
of
the
affection
of
the
girl
i
hoped
to
win
before
hazarding
my
happiness
by
the
terrible
confession
my
resolution
to
acknowledge
everything
openly
at
a
convenient
season
vindicated
the
sophistries
of
worldly
wisdom
and
the
sagacity
of
my
old
friend
so
the
young
girl
s
parents
received
me
as
their
future
without
as
yet
taking
their
friends
into
their
confidence
an
infinite
discretion
is
the
distinguishing
quality
of
pious
families
they
are
reticent
about
everything
even
about
matters
of
no
importance
you
would
not
believe
sir
how
this
sedate
gravity
and
reserve
pervading
every
least
action
deepens
the
current
of
feeling
and
thought
everything
in
that
house
was
done
with
some
useful
end
in
view
the
women
spent
their
leisure
time
in
making
garments
for
the
poor
their
conversation
was
never
frivolous
laughter
was
not
banished
but
there
was
a
kindly
simplicity
about
their
merriment
their
talk
had
none
of
the
piquancy
which
scandal
and
gossip
give
to
the
conversation
of
society
only
the
father
and
uncle
read
the
newspapers
even
the
most
harmless
journal
contains
references
to
crimes
or
to
public
evils
and
she
whom
i
hoped
to
win
had
never
cast
her
eyes
over
their
sheets
how
strange
it
was
at
first
to
listen
to
these
orthodox
people
but
in
a
little
while
the
pure
atmosphere
left
the
same
impression
upon
the
soul
that
subdued
colors
give
to
the
eyes
a
sense
of
serene
repose
and
of
tranquil
peace
to
a
superficial
observer
their
life
would
have
seemed
terribly
monotonous
there
was
something
chilling
about
the
appearance
of
the
interior
of
the
house
day
after
day
i
used
to
see
everything
even
the
furniture
in
constant
use
always
standing
in
the
same
place
and
this
uniform
tidiness
pervaded
the
smallest
details
yet
there
was
something
very
attractive
about
their
household
ways
i
had
been
used
to
the
pleasures
of
variety
to
the
luxury
and
stir
of
life
in
paris
it
was
only
when
i
had
overcome
my
first
repugnance
that
i
saw
the
advantages
of
this
existence
how
it
lent
itself
to
continuity
of
thought
and
to
involuntary
meditation
how
a
life
in
which
the
heart
has
undisturbed
sway
seems
to
widen
and
grow
vast
as
the
sea
it
is
like
the
life
of
the
cloister
where
the
outward
surroundings
never
vary
and
thought
is
thus
compelled
to
detach
itself
from
outward
things
and
to
turn
to
the
infinite
that
lies
within
the
soul
for
a
man
as
sincerely
in
love
as
i
was
the
silence
and
simplicity
of
the
life
the
almost
conventual
regularity
with
which
the
same
things
are
done
daily
at
the
same
hours
only
deepened
and
strengthened
love
in
that
profound
calm
the
interest
attaching
to
the
least
action
word
or
gesture
became
immense
i
learned
to
know
that
in
the
interchange
of
glances
and
in
answering
smiles
there
lies
an
eloquence
and
a
variety
of
language
far
beyond
the
possibilities
of
the
most
magnificent
of
spoken
phrases
that
when
the
expression
of
the
feelings
is
spontaneous
and
unforced
there
is
no
idea
no
joy
nor
sorrow
that
can
not
thus
be
communicated
by
hearts
that
understand
each
other
how
many
times
i
have
tried
to
set
forth
my
soul
in
my
eyes
or
on
my
lips
compelled
at
once
to
speak
and
to
be
silent
concerning
my
passion
for
the
young
girl
who
in
my
presence
was
always
serene
and
unconscious
had
not
been
informed
of
the
reason
of
my
constant
visits
her
parents
were
determined
that
the
most
important
decision
of
her
life
should
rest
entirely
with
her
but
does
not
the
presence
of
our
beloved
satisfy
the
utmost
desire
of
passionate
love
in
that
presence
do
we
not
know
the
happiness
of
the
christian
who
stands
before
god
if
for
me
more
than
for
any
other
it
was
torture
to
have
no
right
to
give
expression
to
the
impulses
of
my
heart
to
force
back
into
its
depths
the
burning
words
that
treacherously
wrong
the
yet
more
ardent
emotions
which
strive
to
find
an
utterance
in
speech
i
found
nevertheless
in
the
merest
trifles
a
channel
through
which
my
passionate
love
poured
itself
forth
but
the
more
vehemently
for
this
constraint
till
every
least
occurrence
came
to
have
an
excessive
importance
i
beheld
her
not
for
brief
moments
but
for
whole
hours
there
were
pauses
between
my
question
and
her
answer
and
long
musings
when
with
the
tones
of
her
voice
lingering
in
my
ears
i
sought
to
divine
from
them
the
secret
of
her
inmost
thoughts
perhaps
her
fingers
would
tremble
as
i
gave
her
some
object
of
which
she
had
been
in
search
or
i
would
devise
pretexts
to
lightly
touch
her
dress
or
her
hair
to
take
her
hand
in
mine
to
compel
her
to
speak
more
than
she
wished
all
these
nothings
were
great
events
for
me
eyes
and
voice
and
gestures
were
freighted
with
mysterious
messages
of
love
in
hours
of
ecstasy
like
these
and
this
was
the
only
language
permitted
me
by
the
quiet
maidenly
reserve
of
the
young
girl
before
me
her
manner
towards
me
underwent
no
change
with
me
she
was
always
as
a
sister
with
a
brother
yet
as
my
passion
grew
and
the
contrast
between
her
glances
and
mine
her
words
and
my
utterance
became
more
striking
i
felt
at
last
that
this
timid
silence
was
the
only
means
by
which
she
could
express
her
feelings
was
she
not
always
in
the
salon
whenever
i
came
did
she
not
stay
there
until
my
visit
expected
and
perhaps
foreseen
was
over
did
not
this
mute
tryst
betray
the
secret
of
her
innocent
soul
nay
whilst
i
spoke
did
she
not
listen
with
a
pleasure
which
she
could
not
hide
at
last
no
doubt
her
parents
grew
impatient
with
this
artless
behavior
and
sober
i
was
almost
as
timid
as
their
daughter
and
perhaps
on
this
account
found
favor
in
their
eyes
they
regarded
me
as
a
man
worthy
of
their
esteem
my
old
friend
was
taken
into
their
confidence
both
father
and
mother
spoke
of
me
in
the
most
flattering
terms
i
had
become
their
adopted
son
and
more
especially
they
singled
out
my
moral
principles
for
praise
in
truth
i
had
found
my
youth
again
among
these
pure
and
religious
surroundings
early
beliefs
and
early
faith
came
back
to
the
man
of
the
summer
was
drawing
to
a
close
affairs
of
some
importance
had
detained
the
family
in
paris
longer
than
their
wont
but
when
september
came
and
they
were
able
to
leave
town
at
last
for
an
estate
in
auvergne
her
father
entreated
me
to
spend
a
couple
of
months
with
them
in
an
old
chateau
hidden
away
among
the
mountains
of
cantal
i
paused
before
accepting
this
friendly
invitation
my
hesitation
brought
me
the
sweetest
and
most
delightful
unconscious
confession
a
revelation
of
the
mysteries
of
a
girlish
heart
evelina
exclaimed
benassis
and
he
said
no
more
for
a
time
wrapped
in
his
own
thoughts
pardon
me
captain
bluteau
he
resumed
after
a
long
pause
for
twelve
years
i
have
not
uttered
the
name
that
is
always
hovering
in
my
thoughts
that
a
voice
calls
in
my
hearing
even
when
i
sleep
evelina
since
i
have
named
her
raised
her
head
with
a
strange
quickness
and
abruptness
for
about
all
her
movements
there
was
an
instinctive
grace
and
gentleness
and
looked
at
me
there
was
no
pride
in
her
face
but
rather
a
wistful
anxiety
then
her
color
rose
and
her
eyelids
fell
it
gave
me
an
indescribable
pleasure
never
felt
before
that
they
should
fall
so
slowly
i
could
only
stammer
out
my
reply
in
a
faltering
voice
the
emotion
of
my
own
heart
made
swift
answer
to
hers
she
thanked
me
by
a
happy
look
and
i
almost
thought
that
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
in
that
moment
we
had
told
each
other
everything
so
i
went
into
the
country
with
her
family
since
the
day
when
our
hearts
had
understood
each
other
nothing
seemed
to
be
as
it
had
been
before
everything
about
us
had
acquired
a
fresh
significance
love
indeed
is
always
the
same
though
our
imagination
determines
the
shape
that
love
must
assume
like
and
unlike
therefore
is
love
in
every
soul
in
which
he
dwells
and
passion
becomes
a
unique
work
in
which
the
soul
expresses
its
sympathies
in
the
old
trite
saying
that
love
is
a
projection
of
self
an
a
lies
a
profound
meaning
known
only
to
philosopher
and
poet
for
it
is
ourself
in
truth
that
we
love
in
that
other
yet
though
love
manifests
itself
in
such
different
ways
that
no
pair
of
lovers
since
the
world
began
is
like
any
other
pair
before
or
since
they
all
express
themselves
after
the
same
fashion
and
the
same
words
are
on
the
lips
of
every
girl
even
of
the
most
innocent
maiden
the
only
difference
lies
in
the
degree
of
imaginative
charm
in
their
ideas
but
between
evelina
and
other
girls
there
was
this
difference
that
where
another
would
have
poured
out
her
feelings
quite
naturally
evelina
regarded
these
innocent
confidences
as
a
concession
made
to
the
stormy
emotions
which
had
invaded
the
quiet
sanctuary
of
her
girlish
soul
the
constant
struggle
between
her
heart
and
her
principles
gave
to
the
least
event
of
her
life
so
peaceful
in
appearance
in
reality
so
profoundly
agitated
a
character
of
force
very
superior
to
the
exaggerations
of
young
girls
whose
manners
are
early
rendered
false
by
the
world
about
them
all
through
the
journey
evelina
discovered
beauty
in
the
scenery
through
which
we
passed
and
spoke
of
it
with
admiration
when
we
think
that
we
may
not
give
expression
to
the
happiness
which
is
given
to
us
by
the
presence
of
one
we
love
we
pour
out
the
secret
gladness
that
overflows
our
hearts
upon
inanimate
things
investing
them
with
beauty
in
our
happiness
the
charm
of
the
scenery
which
passed
before
our
eyes
became
in
this
way
an
interpreter
between
us
for
in
our
praises
of
the
landscape
we
revealed
to
each
other
the
secrets
of
our
love
evelina
s
mother
sometimes
took
a
mischievous
pleasure
in
disconcerting
her
daughter
my
dear
child
you
have
been
through
this
valley
a
score
of
times
without
seeming
to
admire
it
she
remarked
after
a
somewhat
too
enthusiastic
phrase
from
evelina
no
doubt
it
was
because
i
was
not
old
enough
to
understand
beauty
of
this
kind
forgive
me
for
dwelling
on
this
trifle
which
can
have
no
charm
for
you
captain
but
the
simple
words
brought
me
an
indescribable
joy
which
had
its
source
in
the
glance
directed
towards
me
as
she
spoke
so
some
village
lighted
by
sunrise
some
ruin
which
we
had
seen
together
memories
of
outward
and
visible
things
served
to
deepen
and
strengthen
the
impressions
of
our
happiness
they
seemed
to
be
landmarks
on
the
way
through
which
we
were
passing
towards
a
bright
future
that
lay
before
us
we
reached
the
chateau
belonging
to
her
family
where
i
spent
about
six
weeks
the
only
time
in
my
life
during
which
heaven
has
vouchsafed
complete
happiness
to
me
i
enjoyed
pleasures
unknown
to
all
the
happiness
which
two
lovers
find
in
living
beneath
the
same
roof
an
anticipation
of
the
life
they
will
spend
together
to
stroll
through
the
fields
to
be
alone
together
at
times
if
we
wished
it
to
look
over
an
old
to
sit
beneath
a
tree
in
some
lovely
glen
among
the
hills
the
lovers
talks
the
sweet
confidences
drawn
forth
by
which
each
made
some
progress
day
by
day
in
the
other
s
heart
ah
sir
the
life
the
beauty
of
earth
and
heaven
is
a
perfect
accompaniment
to
the
perfect
happiness
of
the
soul
to
mingle
our
careless
talk
with
the
song
of
the
birds
among
the
dewy
leaves
to
smile
at
each
other
as
we
gazed
on
the
sky
to
turn
our
steps
slowly
homewards
at
the
sound
of
the
bell
that
always
rings
too
soon
to
admire
together
some
little
detail
in
the
landscape
to
watch
the
fitful
movements
of
an
insect
to
look
closely
at
a
gleaming
demoiselle
fly
the
delicate
creature
that
resembles
an
innocent
and
loving
girl
in
such
ways
as
these
are
not
one
s
thoughts
drawn
daily
a
little
higher
the
memories
of
my
forty
days
of
happiness
have
in
a
manner
colored
all
the
rest
of
my
life
memories
that
are
all
the
fairer
and
fill
the
greater
space
in
my
thoughts
because
since
then
it
has
been
my
fate
never
to
be
understood
to
this
day
there
are
scenes
of
no
special
interest
for
a
casual
observer
but
full
of
bitter
significance
for
a
broken
heart
which
recall
those
vanished
days
and
the
love
that
is
not
forgotten
yet
i
do
not
know
whether
you
noticed
the
effect
of
the
sunset
light
on
the
cottage
where
little
jacques
lives
everything
shone
so
brightly
in
the
fiery
rays
of
the
sun
and
then
all
at
once
the
whole
landscape
grew
dark
and
dreary
that
sudden
change
was
like
the
change
in
my
own
life
at
this
time
i
received
from
her
the
first
the
sole
and
sublime
token
of
love
that
an
innocent
girl
may
give
the
more
secretly
it
is
given
the
closer
is
the
bond
it
forms
the
sweet
promise
of
love
a
fragment
of
the
language
spoken
in
a
fairer
world
than
this
sure
therefore
of
being
beloved
i
vowed
that
i
would
confess
everything
at
once
that
i
would
have
no
secrets
from
her
i
felt
ashamed
that
i
had
so
long
delayed
to
tell
her
about
the
sorrows
that
i
had
brought
upon
myself
unluckily
with
the
morrow
of
this
happy
day
a
letter
came
from
my
son
s
tutor
the
life
of
the
child
so
dear
to
me
was
in
danger
i
went
away
without
confiding
my
secret
to
evelina
merely
telling
her
family
that
i
was
urgently
required
in
paris
her
parents
took
alarm
during
my
absence
they
feared
that
there
i
was
entangled
in
some
way
and
wrote
to
paris
to
make
inquiries
about
me
it
was
scarcely
consistent
with
their
religious
principles
but
they
suspected
me
and
did
not
even
give
me
an
opportunity
of
clearing
myself
one
of
their
friends
without
my
knowledge
gave
them
the
whole
history
of
my
youth
blackening
my
errors
laying
stress
upon
the
existence
of
my
child
which
said
they
i
intended
to
conceal
i
wrote
to
my
future
parents
but
i
received
no
answers
to
my
letters
and
when
they
came
back
to
paris
and
i
called
at
their
house
i
was
not
admitted
much
alarmed
i
sent
to
my
old
friend
to
learn
the
reason
of
this
conduct
on
their
part
which
i
did
not
in
the
least
understand
as
soon
as
the
good
soul
knew
the
real
cause
of
it
all
he
sacrificed
himself
generously
took
upon
himself
all
the
blame
of
my
reserve
and
tried
to
exculpate
me
but
all
to
no
purpose
questions
of
interest
and
morality
were
regarded
so
seriously
by
the
family
their
prejudices
were
so
firmly
and
deeply
rooted
that
they
never
swerved
from
their
resolution
my
despair
was
overwhelming
at
first
i
tried
to
deprecate
their
wrath
but
my
letters
were
sent
back
to
me
unopened
when
every
possible
means
had
been
tried
in
vain
when
her
father
and
mother
had
plainly
told
my
old
friend
the
cause
of
my
misfortune
that
they
would
never
consent
to
their
daughter
s
marriage
with
a
man
who
had
upon
his
conscience
the
death
of
a
woman
and
the
life
of
a
natural
son
even
though
evelina
herself
should
implore
them
upon
her
knees
then
sir
there
only
remained
to
me
one
last
hope
a
hope
as
slender
and
fragile
as
the
at
which
a
drowning
wretch
catches
to
save
himself
i
ventured
to
think
that
evelina
s
love
would
be
stronger
than
her
father
s
scruples
that
her
inflexible
parents
might
yield
to
her
entreaties
perhaps
who
knows
her
father
had
kept
from
her
the
reasons
of
the
refusal
which
was
so
fatal
to
our
love
i
determined
to
acquaint
her
with
all
the
circumstances
and
to
make
a
final
appeal
to
her
and
in
fear
and
trembling
in
grief
and
tears
my
first
and
last
was
written
i
can
only
dimly
remember
the
words
dictated
to
me
by
my
despair
but
i
must
have
told
evelina
that
if
she
had
dealt
sincerely
with
me
she
could
not
and
ought
not
to
love
another
or
how
could
her
whole
life
be
anything
but
a
lie
she
must
be
false
either
to
her
future
husband
or
to
me
could
she
refuse
to
the
lover
who
had
been
so
misjudged
and
hardly
entreated
the
devotion
which
she
would
have
shown
him
as
her
husband
if
the
marriage
which
had
already
taken
place
in
our
hearts
had
been
outwardly
solemnized
was
not
this
to
fall
from
the
ideal
of
womanly
virtue
what
woman
would
not
love
to
feel
that
the
promises
of
the
heart
were
more
sacred
and
binding
than
the
chains
forged
by
the
law
i
defended
my
errors
and
in
my
appeal
to
the
purity
of
innocence
i
left
nothing
unsaid
that
could
touch
a
noble
and
generous
nature
but
as
i
am
telling
you
everything
i
will
look
for
her
answer
and
my
farewell
letter
said
benassis
and
he
went
up
to
his
room
in
search
of
it
he
returned
in
a
few
moments
with
a
worn
pocketbook
his
hands
trembled
with
emotion
as
he
drew
from
it
some
loose
sheets
here
is
the
fatal
letter
he
said
the
girl
who
wrote
those
lines
little
knew
the
value
that
i
should
set
upon
the
scrap
of
paper
that
holds
her
thoughts
this
is
the
last
cry
that
pain
wrung
from
me
he
added
taking
up
a
second
letter
i
will
lay
it
before
you
directly
my
old
friend
was
the
bearer
of
my
letter
of
entreaty
he
gave
it
to
her
without
her
parents
knowledge
humbling
his
white
hair
to
implore
evelina
to
read
and
to
reply
to
my
appeal
this
was
her
answer
monsieur
but
lately
i
had
been
her
beloved
the
innocent
name
she
had
found
by
which
to
express
her
innocent
love
and
now
she
called
me
that
one
word
told
me
everything
but
listen
to
the
rest
of
the
letter
treachery
on
the
part
of
one
to
whom
her
life
was
to
be
intrusted
is
a
bitter
thing
for
a
girl
to
discover
and
yet
i
could
not
but
excuse
you
we
are
so
weak
your
letter
touched
me
but
you
must
not
write
to
me
again
the
sight
of
your
handwriting
gives
me
such
unbearable
pain
we
are
parted
for
ever
i
was
carried
away
by
your
reasoning
it
extinguished
all
the
harsh
feelings
that
had
risen
up
against
you
in
my
soul
i
had
been
so
proud
of
your
truth
but
both
of
us
have
found
my
father
s
reasoning
irresistible
yes
monsieur
i
ventured
to
plead
for
you
i
did
for
you
what
i
have
never
done
before
i
overcame
the
greatest
fears
that
i
have
ever
known
and
acted
almost
against
my
nature
even
now
i
am
yielding
to
your
entreaties
and
doing
wrong
for
your
sake
in
writing
to
you
without
my
father
s
knowledge
my
mother
knows
that
i
am
writing
to
you
her
indulgence
in
leaving
me
at
liberty
to
be
alone
with
you
for
a
moment
has
taught
me
the
depth
of
her
love
for
me
and
strengthened
my
determination
to
bow
to
the
decree
of
my
family
against
which
i
had
almost
rebelled
so
i
am
writing
to
you
monsieur
for
the
first
and
last
time
you
have
my
full
and
entire
forgiveness
for
the
troubles
that
you
have
brought
into
my
life
yes
you
are
right
a
first
love
can
never
be
forgotten
i
am
no
longer
an
innocent
girl
and
as
an
honest
woman
i
can
never
marry
another
what
my
future
will
be
i
know
not
therefore
only
you
see
monsieur
that
echoes
of
this
year
that
you
have
filled
will
never
die
away
in
my
life
but
i
am
in
no
way
accusing
you
i
shall
always
be
beloved
why
did
you
write
those
words
can
they
bring
peace
to
the
troubled
soul
of
a
lonely
and
unhappy
girl
have
you
not
already
laid
waste
my
future
giving
me
memories
which
will
never
cease
to
revisit
me
henceforth
i
can
only
give
myself
to
god
but
will
he
accept
a
broken
heart
he
has
had
some
purpose
to
fulfil
in
sending
these
afflictions
to
me
doubtless
it
was
his
will
that
i
should
turn
to
him
my
only
refuge
here
below
nothing
remains
to
me
here
upon
this
earth
you
have
all
a
man
s
ambitions
wherewith
to
beguile
your
sorrows
i
do
not
say
this
as
a
reproach
it
is
a
sort
of
religious
consolation
if
we
both
bear
a
grievous
burden
at
this
moment
i
think
that
my
share
of
it
is
the
heavier
he
in
whom
i
have
put
my
trust
and
of
whom
you
can
feel
no
jealousy
has
joined
our
lives
together
and
he
puts
them
asunder
according
to
his
will
i
have
seen
that
your
religious
beliefs
were
not
founded
upon
the
pure
and
living
faith
which
alone
enables
us
to
bear
our
woes
here
below
monsieur
if
god
will
vouchsafe
to
hear
my
fervent
and
ceaseless
prayers
he
will
cause
his
light
to
shine
in
your
soul
farewell
you
who
should
have
been
my
guide
you
whom
once
i
had
the
right
to
call
my
beloved
no
one
can
reproach
me
if
i
pray
for
you
still
god
orders
our
days
as
it
pleases
him
perhaps
you
may
be
the
first
whom
he
will
call
to
himself
but
if
i
am
left
alone
in
the
world
then
monsieur
intrust
the
care
of
the
child
to
this
letter
so
full
of
generous
sentiments
disappointed
my
hopes
benassis
resumed
so
that
at
first
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
my
misery
afterwards
i
welcomed
the
balm
which
in
her
forgetfulness
of
self
she
had
tried
to
pour
into
my
wounds
but
in
my
first
despair
i
wrote
to
her
somewhat
bitterly
mademoiselle
that
word
alone
will
tell
you
that
at
your
bidding
i
renounce
you
there
is
something
indescribably
sweet
in
obeying
one
we
love
who
puts
us
to
the
torture
you
are
right
i
acquiesce
in
my
condemnation
once
i
slighted
a
girl
s
devotion
it
is
fitting
therefore
that
my
love
should
be
rejected
but
i
little
thought
that
my
punishment
was
to
be
dealt
to
me
by
the
woman
at
whose
feet
i
had
laid
my
life
i
never
expected
that
such
harshness
perhaps
i
should
say
such
rigid
virtue
lurked
in
a
heart
that
seemed
to
be
so
loving
and
so
tender
at
this
moment
the
full
strength
of
my
love
is
revealed
to
me
it
has
survived
the
most
terrible
of
all
trials
the
scorn
you
have
shown
for
me
by
severing
without
regret
the
ties
that
bound
us
farewell
for
ever
there
still
remains
to
me
the
proud
humility
of
repentance
i
will
find
some
sphere
of
life
where
i
can
expiate
the
errors
to
which
you
the
mediator
between
heaven
and
me
have
shown
no
mercy
perhaps
god
may
be
less
inexorable
my
sufferings
sufferings
full
of
the
thought
of
you
shall
be
the
penance
of
a
heart
which
will
never
be
healed
which
will
bleed
in
solitude
for
a
wounded
heart
shadow
and
silence
no
other
image
of
love
shall
be
engraven
on
my
heart
though
i
am
not
a
woman
i
feel
as
you
felt
that
when
i
said
i
love
you
it
was
a
vow
for
life
yes
the
words
then
spoken
in
the
ear
of
my
beloved
were
not
a
lie
you
would
have
a
right
to
scorn
me
if
i
could
change
i
shall
never
cease
to
worship
you
in
my
solitude
in
spite
of
the
gulf
set
between
us
you
will
still
be
the
mainspring
of
all
my
actions
and
all
the
virtues
are
inspired
by
penitence
and
love
though
you
have
filled
my
heart
with
bitterness
i
shall
never
have
bitter
thoughts
of
you
would
it
not
be
an
ill
beginning
of
the
new
tasks
that
i
have
set
myself
if
i
did
not
purge
out
all
the
evil
leaven
from
my
soul
farewell
then
to
the
one
heart
that
i
love
in
the
world
a
heart
from
which
i
am
cast
out
never
has
more
feeling
and
more
tenderness
been
expressed
in
a
farewell
for
is
it
not
fraught
with
the
life
and
soul
of
one
who
can
never
hope
again
and
must
be
henceforth
as
one
dead
farewell
may
peace
be
with
you
and
may
all
the
sorrow
of
our
lot
fall
to
me
benassis
and
genestas
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
after
reading
the
two
letters
each
full
of
sad
thoughts
of
which
neither
spoke
as
you
see
this
is
only
a
rough
copy
of
my
last
letter
said
benassis
it
is
all
that
remains
to
me
of
my
blighted
hopes
when
i
had
sent
the
letter
i
fell
into
an
indescribable
state
of
depression
all
the
ties
that
hold
one
to
life
were
bound
together
in
the
hope
of
wedded
happiness
which
was
henceforth
lost
to
me
for
ever
i
had
to
bid
farewell
to
the
joys
of
a
permitted
and
acknowledged
love
to
all
the
generous
ideas
that
had
thronged
up
from
the
depths
of
my
heart
the
prayers
of
a
penitent
soul
that
thirsted
for
righteousness
and
for
all
things
lovely
and
of
good
report
had
been
rejected
by
these
religious
people
at
first
the
wildest
resolutions
and
most
frantic
thoughts
surged
through
my
mind
but
happily
for
me
the
sight
of
my
son
brought
i
felt
all
the
more
strongly
drawn
towards
him
for
the
misfortunes
of
which
he
was
the
innocent
cause
and
for
which
i
had
in
reality
only
myself
to
blame
in
him
i
found
all
my
consolation
at
the
age
of
i
might
still
hope
to
do
my
country
noble
service
i
determined
to
make
a
name
for
myself
a
name
so
illustrious
that
no
one
should
remember
the
stain
on
the
birth
of
my
son
how
many
noble
thoughts
i
owe
to
him
how
full
a
life
i
led
in
those
days
while
i
was
absorbed
in
planning
out
his
future
i
feel
stifled
cried
benassis
all
this
happened
eleven
years
ago
and
yet
to
this
day
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
that
fatal
year
my
child
died
sir
i
lost
him
the
doctor
was
silent
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
when
he
was
somewhat
calmer
he
raised
his
head
again
and
genestas
saw
that
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
at
first
it
seemed
as
if
this
thunderbolt
had
uprooted
me
benassis
resumed
it
was
a
blow
from
which
i
could
only
expect
to
recover
after
i
had
been
transplanted
into
a
different
soil
from
that
of
the
social
world
in
which
i
lived
it
was
not
till
some
time
afterwards
that
i
saw
the
finger
of
god
in
my
misfortunes
and
later
still
that
i
learned
to
submit
to
his
will
and
to
hearken
to
his
voice
it
was
impossible
that
resignation
should
come
to
me
all
at
once
my
impetuous
and
fiery
nature
broke
out
in
a
final
storm
of
rebellion
it
was
long
before
i
brought
myself
to
take
the
only
step
befitting
a
catholic
indeed
my
thoughts
ran
on
suicide
this
succession
of
misfortunes
had
contributed
to
develop
melancholy
feelings
in
me
and
i
deliberately
determined
to
take
my
own
life
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
permissible
to
take
leave
of
life
when
life
was
ebbing
fast
there
was
nothing
unnatural
i
thought
about
suicide
the
ravages
of
mental
distress
affected
the
soul
of
man
in
the
same
way
that
acute
physical
anguish
affected
the
body
and
an
intelligent
being
suffering
from
a
moral
malady
had
surely
a
right
to
destroy
himself
a
right
he
shares
with
the
sheep
that
fallen
a
victim
to
the
staggers
beats
its
head
against
a
tree
were
the
soul
s
diseases
in
truth
more
readily
cured
than
those
of
the
body
i
scarcely
think
so
to
this
day
nor
do
i
know
which
is
the
more
craven
soul
he
who
hopes
even
when
hope
is
no
longer
possible
or
he
who
despairs
death
is
the
natural
termination
of
a
physical
malady
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
suicide
was
the
final
crisis
in
the
sufferings
of
a
mind
diseased
for
it
was
in
the
power
of
the
will
to
end
them
when
reason
showed
that
death
was
preferable
to
life
so
it
is
not
the
pistol
but
a
thought
that
puts
an
end
to
our
existence
again
when
fate
may
suddenly
lay
us
low
in
the
midst
of
a
happy
life
can
we
be
blamed
for
ourselves
refusing
to
bear
a
life
of
misery
but
my
reflections
during
that
time
of
mourning
turned
on
loftier
themes
the
grandeur
of
pagan
philosophy
attracted
me
and
for
a
while
i
became
a
convert
in
my
efforts
to
discover
new
rights
for
man
i
thought
that
with
the
aid
of
modern
thought
i
could
penetrate
further
into
the
questions
to
which
those
systems
of
philosophy
had
furnished
solutions
epicurus
permitted
suicide
was
it
not
the
natural
outcome
of
his
system
of
ethics
the
gratification
of
the
senses
was
to
be
obtained
at
any
cost
and
when
this
became
impossible
the
easiest
and
best
course
was
for
the
animate
being
to
return
to
the
repose
of
inanimate
nature
happiness
or
the
hope
of
happiness
was
the
one
end
for
which
man
existed
for
one
who
suffered
and
who
suffered
without
hope
death
ceased
to
be
an
evil
and
became
a
good
and
suicide
became
a
final
act
of
wisdom
this
act
epicurus
neither
blamed
nor
praised
he
was
content
to
say
as
he
poured
a
libation
to
bacchus
for
death
there
is
nothing
in
death
to
move
our
laughter
or
our
with
a
loftier
morality
than
that
of
the
epicureans
and
a
sterner
sense
of
man
s
duties
zeno
and
the
stoic
philosophers
prescribed
suicide
in
certain
cases
to
their
followers
they
reasoned
thus
man
differs
from
the
brute
in
that
he
has
the
sovereign
right
to
dispose
of
his
person
take
away
this
power
of
life
and
death
over
himself
and
he
becomes
the
plaything
of
fate
the
slave
of
other
men
rightly
understood
this
power
of
life
and
death
is
a
sufficient
counterpoise
for
all
the
ills
of
life
the
same
power
when
conferred
upon
another
upon
his
leads
to
tyranny
of
every
kind
man
has
no
power
whatever
unless
he
has
unlimited
freedom
of
action
suppose
that
he
has
been
guilty
of
some
irreparable
error
from
the
shameful
consequences
of
which
there
is
no
escape
a
sordid
nature
swallows
down
the
disgrace
and
survives
it
the
wise
man
drinks
the
hemlock
and
dies
suppose
that
the
remainder
of
life
is
to
be
one
constant
struggle
with
the
gout
which
racks
our
bones
or
with
a
gnawing
and
disfiguring
cancer
the
wise
man
dismisses
quacks
and
at
the
proper
moment
bids
a
last
farewell
to
the
friends
whom
he
only
saddens
by
his
presence
or
another
perhaps
has
fallen
alive
into
the
hands
of
the
tyrant
against
whom
he
fought
what
shall
he
do
the
oath
of
allegiance
is
tendered
to
him
he
must
either
subscribe
or
stretch
out
his
neck
to
the
executioner
the
fool
takes
the
latter
course
the
coward
subscribes
the
wise
man
strikes
a
last
blow
for
liberty
in
his
own
heart
you
who
are
free
the
stoic
was
wont
to
say
know
then
how
to
preserve
your
freedom
find
freedom
from
your
own
passions
by
sacrificing
them
to
duty
freedom
from
the
tyranny
of
mankind
by
pointing
to
the
sword
or
the
poison
which
will
put
you
beyond
their
reach
freedom
from
the
bondage
of
fate
by
determining
the
point
beyond
which
you
will
endure
it
no
longer
freedom
from
physical
fear
by
learning
how
to
subdue
the
gross
instinct
which
causes
so
many
wretches
to
cling
to
after
i
had
unearthed
this
reasoning
from
among
a
heap
of
ancient
philosophical
writings
i
sought
to
reconcile
it
with
christian
teachings
god
has
bestowed
upon
us
in
order
to
require
of
us
an
account
hereafter
before
the
throne
of
judgment
i
will
plead
my
cause
there
i
said
to
myself
but
such
thoughts
as
these
led
me
to
think
of
a
life
after
death
and
my
old
shaken
beliefs
rose
up
before
me
human
life
grows
solemn
when
all
eternity
hangs
upon
the
slightest
of
our
decisions
when
the
full
meaning
of
this
thought
is
realized
the
soul
becomes
conscious
of
something
vast
and
mysterious
within
itself
by
which
it
is
drawn
towards
the
infinite
the
aspect
of
all
things
alters
strangely
from
this
point
of
view
life
is
something
infinitely
great
and
infinitely
little
the
consciousness
of
my
sins
had
never
made
me
think
of
heaven
so
long
as
hope
remained
to
me
on
earth
so
long
as
i
could
find
a
relief
for
my
woes
in
work
and
in
the
society
of
other
men
i
had
meant
to
make
the
happiness
of
a
woman
s
life
to
love
to
be
the
head
of
a
family
and
in
this
way
my
need
of
expiation
would
have
been
satisfied
to
the
full
this
design
had
been
thwarted
but
yet
another
way
had
remained
to
me
i
would
devote
myself
henceforward
to
my
child
but
after
these
two
efforts
had
failed
and
scorn
and
death
had
darkened
my
soul
for
ever
when
all
my
feelings
had
been
wounded
and
nothing
was
left
to
me
here
on
earth
i
raised
my
eyes
to
heaven
and
beheld
god
yet
still
i
tried
to
obtain
the
sanction
of
religion
for
my
death
i
went
carefully
through
the
gospels
and
found
no
passage
in
which
suicide
was
forbidden
but
during
the
reading
the
divine
thought
of
christ
the
saviour
of
men
dawned
in
me
certainly
he
had
said
nothing
about
the
immortality
of
the
soul
but
he
had
spoken
of
the
glorious
kingdom
of
his
father
he
had
nowhere
forbidden
parricide
but
he
condemned
all
that
was
evil
the
glory
of
his
evangelists
and
the
proof
of
their
divine
mission
is
not
so
much
that
they
made
laws
for
the
world
but
that
they
spread
a
new
spirit
abroad
and
the
new
laws
were
filled
with
this
new
spirit
the
very
courage
which
a
man
displays
in
taking
his
own
life
seemed
to
me
to
be
his
condemnation
so
long
as
he
felt
that
he
had
within
himself
sufficient
strength
to
die
by
his
own
hands
he
ought
to
have
had
strength
enough
to
continue
the
struggle
to
refuse
to
suffer
is
a
sign
of
weakness
rather
than
of
courage
and
moreover
was
it
not
a
sort
of
recusance
to
take
leave
of
life
in
despondency
an
abjuration
of
the
christian
faith
which
is
based
upon
the
sublime
words
of
jesus
christ
blessed
are
they
that
so
in
any
case
suicide
seemed
to
me
to
be
an
unpardonable
error
even
in
the
man
who
through
a
false
conception
of
greatness
of
soul
takes
his
life
a
few
moments
before
the
executioner
s
axe
falls
in
humbling
himself
to
the
death
of
the
cross
did
not
jesus
christ
set
for
us
an
example
of
obedience
to
all
human
laws
even
when
carried
out
unjustly
the
word
engraved
upon
the
cross
so
clear
to
the
eyes
of
those
who
can
read
the
sacred
characters
in
which
it
is
traced
shone
for
me
with
divine
brightness
i
still
had
eighty
thousand
francs
in
my
possession
and
at
first
i
meant
to
live
a
remote
and
solitary
life
to
vegetate
in
some
country
district
for
the
rest
of
my
days
but
misanthropy
is
no
catholic
virtue
and
there
is
a
certain
vanity
lurking
beneath
the
hedgehog
s
skin
of
the
misanthrope
his
heart
does
not
bleed
it
shrivels
and
my
heart
bled
from
every
vein
i
thought
of
the
discipline
of
the
church
the
refuge
that
she
affords
to
sorrowing
souls
understood
at
last
the
beauty
of
a
life
of
prayer
in
solitude
and
was
fully
determined
to
enter
religion
in
the
grand
old
phrase
so
far
my
intentions
were
firmly
fixed
but
i
had
not
yet
decided
on
the
best
means
of
carrying
them
out
i
realized
the
remains
of
my
fortune
and
set
forth
on
my
journey
with
an
almost
tranquil
mind
in
was
a
hope
that
could
never
fail
me
i
felt
drawn
to
the
rule
of
saint
bruno
and
made
the
journey
to
the
grande
chartreuse
on
foot
absorbed
in
solemn
thoughts
that
was
a
memorable
day
i
was
not
prepared
for
the
grandeur
of
the
scenery
the
workings
of
an
unknown
power
greater
than
that
of
man
were
visible
at
every
step
the
overhanging
crags
the
precipices
on
either
hand
the
stillness
only
broken
by
the
voices
of
the
mountain
streams
the
sternness
and
wildness
of
the
landscape
relieved
here
and
there
by
nature
s
fairest
creations
pine
trees
that
have
stood
for
centuries
and
delicate
rock
plants
at
their
feet
all
combine
to
produce
sober
musings
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
this
waste
solitude
shut
in
by
its
lofty
mountain
barriers
the
idle
curiosity
of
man
could
scarcely
penetrate
there
it
would
be
difficult
to
cross
this
melancholy
desert
of
saint
bruno
s
with
a
light
heart
i
saw
the
grand
chartreuse
i
walked
beneath
the
vaulted
roofs
of
the
ancient
cloisters
and
heard
in
the
silence
the
sound
of
the
water
from
the
spring
falling
drop
by
drop
i
entered
a
cell
that
i
might
the
better
realize
my
own
utter
nothingness
something
of
the
peace
that
my
predecessor
had
found
there
seemed
to
pass
into
my
soul
an
inscription
which
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
the
monastery
he
had
written
above
his
door
impressed
and
touched
me
all
the
precepts
of
the
life
that
i
had
meant
to
lead
were
there
summed
up
in
three
latin
words
late
genestas
bent
his
head
as
if
he
understood
my
decision
was
made
benassis
resumed
the
cell
with
its
deal
wainscot
the
hard
bed
the
solitude
all
appealed
to
my
soul
the
carthusians
were
in
the
chapel
i
went
thither
to
join
in
their
prayers
and
there
my
resolutions
vanished
i
do
not
wish
to
criticise
the
catholic
church
i
am
perfectly
orthodox
i
believe
in
its
laws
and
in
the
works
it
prescribes
but
when
i
heard
the
chanting
and
the
prayers
of
those
old
men
dead
to
the
world
and
forgotten
by
the
world
i
discerned
an
undercurrent
of
sublime
egoism
in
the
life
of
the
cloister
this
withdrawal
from
the
world
could
only
benefit
the
individual
soul
and
after
all
what
was
it
but
a
protracted
suicide
i
do
not
condemn
it
the
church
has
opened
these
tombs
in
which
life
is
buried
no
doubt
they
are
needful
for
those
few
christians
who
are
absolutely
useless
to
the
world
but
for
me
it
would
be
better
i
thought
to
live
among
my
fellows
to
devote
my
life
of
expiation
to
their
service
as
i
returned
i
thought
long
and
carefully
over
the
various
ways
in
which
i
could
carry
out
my
vow
of
renunciation
already
i
began
in
fancy
to
lead
the
life
of
a
common
sailor
condemning
myself
to
serve
our
country
in
the
lowest
ranks
and
giving
up
all
my
intellectual
ambitions
but
though
it
was
a
life
of
toil
and
of
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
ought
to
do
more
than
this
should
i
not
thwart
the
designs
of
god
by
leading
such
a
life
if
he
had
given
me
intellectual
ability
was
it
not
my
duty
to
employ
it
for
the
good
of
my
then
besides
if
i
am
to
speak
frankly
i
felt
within
me
a
need
of
my
an
indescribable
wish
to
help
them
the
round
of
mechanical
duties
and
the
routine
tasks
of
the
sailor
afforded
no
scope
for
this
desire
which
is
as
much
an
outcome
of
my
nature
as
the
characteristic
scent
that
a
flower
breathes
forth
i
was
obliged
to
spend
the
night
here
as
i
have
already
told
you
the
wretched
condition
of
the
countryside
had
filled
me
with
pity
and
during
the
night
it
seemed
as
if
these
thoughts
had
been
sent
to
me
by
god
and
that
thus
he
had
revealed
his
will
to
me
i
had
known
something
of
the
joys
that
pierce
the
heart
the
happiness
and
the
sorrow
of
motherhood
i
determined
that
henceforth
my
life
should
be
filled
with
these
but
that
mine
should
be
a
wider
sphere
than
a
mother
s
i
would
expend
her
care
and
kindness
on
the
whole
district
i
would
be
a
sister
of
charity
and
bind
the
wounds
of
all
the
suffering
poor
in
a
countryside
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
finger
of
god
unmistakably
pointed
out
my
destiny
and
when
i
remembered
that
my
first
serious
thoughts
in
youth
had
inclined
me
to
the
study
of
medicine
i
resolved
to
settle
here
as
a
doctor
besides
i
had
another
reason
a
wounded
heart
shadow
and
so
i
had
written
in
my
letter
and
i
meant
to
fulfil
the
vow
which
i
had
made
to
myself
so
i
have
entered
into
the
paths
of
silence
and
submission
the
late
of
the
carthusian
brother
is
my
motto
here
my
death
to
the
world
is
the
life
of
this
canton
my
prayer
takes
the
form
of
the
active
work
to
which
i
have
set
my
hand
and
which
i
love
the
work
of
sowing
the
seeds
of
happiness
and
joy
of
giving
to
others
what
i
myself
have
not
i
have
grown
so
used
to
this
life
completely
out
of
the
world
and
among
the
peasants
that
i
am
thoroughly
transformed
even
my
face
is
altered
it
has
been
so
continually
exposed
to
the
sun
that
it
has
grown
wrinkled
and
i
have
fallen
into
the
habits
of
the
peasants
i
have
assumed
their
dress
their
ways
of
talking
their
gait
their
negligence
their
utter
indifference
to
appearances
my
old
acquaintances
in
paris
or
the
on
whom
i
used
to
dance
attendance
would
be
puzzled
to
recognize
in
me
the
man
who
had
a
certain
vogue
in
his
day
the
sybarite
accustomed
to
all
the
splendor
luxury
and
finery
of
paris
i
have
come
to
be
absolutely
indifferent
to
my
surroundings
like
all
those
who
are
possessed
by
one
thought
and
have
only
one
object
in
view
for
i
have
but
one
aim
in
life
to
take
leave
of
it
as
soon
as
possible
i
do
not
want
to
hasten
my
end
in
any
way
but
some
day
when
illness
comes
i
shall
lie
down
to
die
without
regret
there
sir
you
have
the
whole
story
of
my
life
until
i
came
here
told
in
all
sincerity
i
have
not
attempted
to
conceal
any
of
my
errors
they
have
been
great
though
others
have
erred
as
i
have
erred
i
have
suffered
greatly
and
i
am
suffering
still
but
i
look
beyond
this
life
to
a
happy
future
which
can
only
be
reached
through
sorrow
and
yet
for
all
my
resignation
there
are
moments
when
my
courage
fails
me
this
very
day
i
was
almost
overcome
in
your
presence
by
inward
anguish
you
did
not
notice
it
but
genestas
started
in
his
chair
yes
captain
bluteau
you
were
with
me
at
the
time
do
you
remember
how
while
we
were
putting
little
jacques
to
bed
you
pointed
to
the
mattress
on
which
mother
colas
sleeps
well
you
can
imagine
how
painful
it
all
was
i
can
never
see
any
child
without
thinking
of
the
dear
child
i
have
lost
and
this
little
one
was
doomed
to
die
i
can
never
see
a
child
with
indifferent
eyes
genestas
turned
pale
yes
the
sight
of
the
little
golden
heads
the
innocent
beauty
of
children
s
faces
always
awakens
memories
of
my
sorrows
and
the
old
anguish
returns
afresh
now
and
then
too
there
comes
the
intolerable
thought
that
so
many
people
here
should
thank
me
for
what
little
i
can
do
for
them
when
all
that
i
have
done
has
been
prompted
by
remorse
you
alone
captain
know
the
secret
of
my
life
if
i
had
drawn
my
will
to
serve
them
from
some
purer
source
than
the
memory
of
my
errors
i
should
be
happy
indeed
but
then
too
there
would
have
been
nothing
to
tell
you
and
no
story
about
chapter
elegies
as
benassis
finished
his
story
he
was
struck
by
the
troubled
expression
of
the
officer
s
face
it
touched
him
to
have
been
so
well
understood
he
was
almost
ready
to
reproach
himself
for
having
distressed
his
visitor
he
spoke
but
these
troubles
of
mine
captain
bluteau
do
not
call
me
captain
bluteau
cried
genestas
breaking
in
upon
the
doctor
and
springing
to
his
feet
with
sudden
energy
a
change
of
position
that
seemed
to
be
prompted
by
inward
dissatisfaction
of
some
kind
there
is
no
such
person
as
captain
bluteau
i
am
a
scoundrel
with
no
little
astonishment
benassis
beheld
genestas
pacing
to
and
fro
in
the
salon
like
a
in
quest
of
an
exit
from
the
room
which
he
has
incautiously
entered
then
who
are
you
sir
inquired
benassis
ah
there
now
the
officer
answered
as
he
turned
and
took
his
stand
before
the
doctor
though
he
lacked
courage
to
look
at
his
friend
i
have
deceived
you
he
went
on
and
there
was
a
change
in
his
voice
i
have
acted
a
lie
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
and
i
am
well
punished
for
it
for
after
this
i
can
not
explain
why
i
came
here
to
play
the
spy
upon
you
confound
it
ever
since
i
have
had
a
glimpse
of
your
soul
so
to
speak
i
would
far
sooner
have
taken
a
box
on
the
ear
whenever
i
heard
you
call
me
captain
bluteau
perhaps
you
may
forgive
me
for
this
subterfuge
but
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
i
pierre
joseph
genestas
who
would
not
lie
to
save
my
life
before
a
are
you
commandant
genestas
cried
benassis
rising
to
his
feet
he
grasped
the
officer
s
hand
warmly
and
added
as
you
said
but
a
short
time
ago
sir
we
were
friends
before
we
knew
each
other
i
have
been
very
anxious
to
make
your
acquaintance
for
i
have
often
heard
gravier
speak
of
you
he
used
to
call
you
one
of
plutarch
s
plutarch
nothing
of
the
sort
answered
genestas
i
am
not
worthy
of
you
i
could
thrash
myself
i
ought
to
have
told
you
my
secret
in
a
straightforward
way
at
the
first
yet
now
it
is
quite
as
well
that
i
wore
a
mask
and
came
here
myself
in
search
of
information
concerning
you
for
now
i
know
that
i
must
hold
my
tongue
if
i
had
set
about
this
business
in
the
right
fashion
it
would
have
been
painful
to
you
and
god
forbid
that
i
should
give
you
the
slightest
but
i
do
not
understand
you
let
the
matter
drop
i
am
not
ill
i
have
spent
a
pleasant
day
and
i
will
go
back
whenever
you
come
to
grenoble
you
will
find
that
you
have
one
more
friend
there
who
will
be
your
friend
through
thick
and
thin
pierre
joseph
genestas
sword
and
purse
are
at
your
disposal
and
i
am
yours
to
the
last
drop
of
my
blood
well
after
all
your
words
have
fallen
on
good
soil
when
i
am
pensioned
off
i
will
look
for
some
little
place
and
be
mayor
of
it
and
try
to
follow
your
example
i
have
not
your
knowledge
but
i
will
study
at
any
you
are
right
sir
the
landowner
who
spends
his
time
in
convincing
a
commune
of
the
folly
of
some
mistaken
notion
of
agriculture
confers
upon
his
country
a
benefit
quite
as
great
as
any
that
the
most
skilful
physician
can
bestow
the
latter
lessens
the
sufferings
of
some
few
individuals
and
the
former
heals
the
wounds
of
his
country
but
you
have
excited
my
curiosity
to
no
common
degree
is
there
really
something
in
which
i
can
be
of
use
to
you
of
use
repeated
the
commandant
in
an
altered
voice
dieu
i
was
about
to
ask
you
to
do
me
a
service
which
is
all
but
impossible
benassis
just
listen
a
moment
i
have
killed
a
good
many
christians
in
my
time
it
is
true
but
you
may
kill
people
and
keep
a
good
heart
for
all
that
so
there
are
some
things
that
i
can
feel
and
understand
rough
as
i
but
go
on
no
i
do
not
want
to
give
you
any
pain
if
i
can
help
oh
commandant
i
can
bear
a
great
it
is
a
question
of
a
child
s
life
sir
said
the
officer
nervously
benassis
suddenly
knitted
his
brows
but
by
a
gesture
he
entreated
genestas
to
continue
a
child
repeated
the
commandant
whose
life
may
yet
be
saved
by
constant
watchfulness
and
incessant
care
where
could
i
expect
to
find
a
doctor
capable
of
devoting
himself
to
a
single
patient
not
in
a
town
that
much
was
certain
i
had
heard
you
spoken
of
as
an
excellent
man
but
i
wished
to
be
quite
sure
that
this
reputation
was
well
founded
so
before
putting
my
little
charge
into
the
hands
of
this
benassis
of
whom
people
spoke
so
highly
i
wanted
to
study
him
myself
but
now
enough
said
the
doctor
so
this
child
is
yours
no
no
benassis
to
clear
up
the
mystery
i
should
have
to
tell
you
a
long
story
in
which
i
do
not
exactly
play
the
part
of
a
hero
but
you
have
given
me
your
confidence
and
i
can
readily
give
you
one
moment
commandant
said
the
doctor
in
answer
to
his
summons
jacquotte
appeared
at
once
and
her
master
ordered
tea
you
see
commandant
at
night
when
every
one
is
sleeping
i
do
not
sleep
the
thought
of
my
troubles
lies
heavily
on
me
and
then
i
try
to
forget
them
by
taking
tea
it
produces
a
sort
of
nervous
inebriation
a
kind
of
slumber
without
which
i
could
not
live
do
you
still
decline
to
take
it
for
my
own
part
said
genestas
i
prefer
your
by
all
means
jacquotte
said
benassis
turning
to
his
housekeeper
bring
in
some
wine
and
biscuits
we
will
both
of
us
have
our
after
our
separate
that
tea
must
be
very
bad
for
you
genestas
remarked
it
brings
on
horrid
attacks
of
gout
but
i
can
not
break
myself
of
the
habit
it
is
too
soothing
it
procures
for
me
a
brief
respite
every
night
a
few
moments
during
which
life
becomes
less
of
a
burden
come
i
am
listening
perhaps
your
story
will
efface
the
painful
impressions
left
by
the
memories
that
i
have
just
genestas
set
down
his
empty
glass
upon
the
after
the
retreat
from
moscow
he
said
my
regiment
was
stationed
to
recruit
for
a
while
in
a
little
town
in
poland
we
were
quartered
there
in
fact
till
the
emperor
returned
and
we
bought
up
horses
at
long
prices
so
far
so
good
i
ought
to
say
that
i
had
a
friend
in
those
days
more
than
once
during
the
retreat
i
had
owed
my
life
to
him
he
was
a
quartermaster
renard
by
name
we
could
not
but
be
like
brothers
military
discipline
apart
after
what
he
had
done
for
me
they
billeted
us
on
the
same
house
a
sort
of
shanty
a
of
a
place
where
a
whole
family
lived
though
you
would
not
have
thought
there
was
room
to
stable
a
horse
this
particular
hovel
belonged
to
some
jews
who
carried
on
their
trades
in
it
the
frost
had
not
so
stiffened
the
old
father
jew
s
fingers
but
that
he
could
count
gold
fast
enough
he
had
thriven
uncommonly
during
our
reverses
that
sort
of
gentry
lives
in
squalor
and
dies
in
gold
there
were
cellars
underneath
lined
with
wood
of
course
the
whole
house
was
built
of
wood
they
had
stowed
their
children
away
down
there
and
one
more
particularly
a
girl
of
seventeen
as
handsome
as
a
jewess
can
be
when
she
keeps
herself
tidy
and
has
not
fair
hair
she
was
as
white
as
snow
she
had
eyes
like
velvet
and
dark
lashes
to
them
like
rats
tails
her
hair
was
so
thick
and
glossy
that
it
made
you
long
to
stroke
it
she
was
perfection
and
nothing
less
i
was
the
first
to
discover
this
curious
arrangement
i
was
walking
up
and
down
outside
one
evening
smoking
my
pipe
after
they
thought
i
had
gone
to
bed
the
children
came
in
tumbling
over
one
another
like
so
many
puppies
it
was
fun
to
watch
them
then
they
had
supper
with
their
father
and
mother
i
strained
my
eyes
to
see
the
young
jewess
through
the
clouds
of
smoke
that
her
father
blew
from
his
pipe
she
looked
like
a
new
gold
piece
among
a
lot
of
copper
coins
i
had
never
reflected
about
love
my
dear
benassis
i
had
never
had
time
but
now
at
the
sight
of
this
young
girl
i
lost
my
heart
and
head
and
everything
else
at
once
and
then
it
was
plain
to
me
that
i
had
never
been
in
love
before
i
was
hard
hit
and
over
head
and
ears
in
love
there
i
stayed
smoking
my
pipe
absorbed
in
watching
the
jewess
until
she
blew
out
the
candle
and
went
to
bed
i
could
not
close
my
eyes
the
whole
night
long
i
walked
up
and
down
the
street
smoking
my
pipe
and
refilling
it
from
time
to
time
i
had
never
felt
like
that
before
and
for
the
first
and
last
time
in
my
life
i
thought
of
marrying
at
daybreak
i
saddled
my
horse
and
rode
out
into
the
country
to
clear
my
head
i
kept
him
at
a
trot
for
two
mortal
hours
and
all
but
foundered
the
animal
before
i
noticed
it
genestas
stopped
short
looked
at
his
new
friend
uneasily
and
said
you
must
excuse
me
benassis
i
am
no
orator
things
come
out
just
as
they
turn
up
in
my
mind
in
a
room
full
of
fine
folk
i
should
feel
awkward
but
here
in
the
country
with
you
go
on
said
the
doctor
when
i
came
back
to
my
room
i
found
renard
finely
flustered
he
thought
i
had
fallen
in
a
duel
he
was
cleaning
his
pistols
his
head
full
of
schemes
for
fastening
a
quarrel
on
any
one
who
should
have
turned
me
off
into
the
dark
oh
that
was
just
the
fellow
s
way
i
confided
my
story
to
renard
showed
him
the
kennel
where
the
children
were
and
as
my
comrade
understood
the
jargon
that
those
heathens
talked
i
begged
him
to
help
me
to
lay
my
proposals
before
her
father
and
mother
and
to
try
to
arrange
some
kind
of
communication
between
me
and
judith
judith
they
called
her
in
short
sir
for
a
fortnight
the
jew
and
his
wife
so
arranged
matters
that
we
supped
every
night
with
judith
and
for
a
fortnight
i
was
the
happiest
of
men
you
understand
and
you
know
how
it
was
so
i
shall
not
wear
out
your
patience
still
if
you
do
not
smoke
you
can
not
imagine
how
pleasant
it
was
to
smoke
a
pipe
at
one
s
ease
with
renard
and
the
girl
s
father
and
one
s
princess
there
before
one
s
eyes
oh
yes
it
was
very
pleasant
but
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
renard
was
a
parisian
and
dependent
on
his
father
a
wholesale
grocer
who
had
educated
his
son
with
a
view
to
making
a
notary
of
him
so
renard
had
come
by
a
certain
amount
of
book
learning
before
he
had
been
drawn
by
the
conscription
and
had
to
bid
his
desk
add
to
this
that
he
was
the
kind
of
man
who
looks
well
in
a
uniform
with
a
face
like
a
girl
s
and
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
art
of
wheedling
people
it
was
he
whom
judith
loved
she
cared
about
as
much
for
me
as
a
horse
cares
for
roast
fowls
whilst
i
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
soaring
above
the
clouds
at
the
bare
sight
of
judith
my
friend
renard
who
as
you
see
fairly
deserved
his
name
arrived
at
an
understanding
with
the
girl
and
to
such
good
purpose
that
they
were
married
forthwith
after
the
custom
of
her
country
without
waiting
for
permission
which
would
have
been
too
long
in
coming
he
promised
her
however
that
if
it
should
happen
that
the
validity
of
this
marriage
was
afterwards
called
in
question
they
were
to
be
married
again
according
to
french
law
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
soon
as
she
reached
france
mme
renard
became
mlle
judith
once
more
if
i
had
known
all
this
i
would
have
killed
renard
then
and
there
without
giving
him
time
to
draw
another
breath
but
the
father
the
mother
the
girl
herself
and
the
quartermaster
were
all
in
the
plot
like
thieves
in
a
fair
while
i
was
smoking
my
pipe
and
worshiping
judith
as
if
she
had
been
one
of
the
saints
above
the
worthy
renard
was
arranging
to
meet
her
and
managing
this
piece
of
business
very
cleverly
under
my
very
eyes
you
are
the
only
person
to
whom
i
have
told
this
story
a
disgraceful
thing
i
call
it
i
have
always
asked
myself
how
it
is
that
a
man
who
would
die
of
shame
if
he
took
a
gold
coin
that
did
not
belong
to
him
does
not
scruple
to
rob
a
friend
of
happiness
and
life
and
the
woman
he
loves
my
birds
in
fact
were
married
and
happy
and
there
was
i
every
evening
at
supper
moonstruck
gazing
at
judith
responding
like
some
fellow
in
a
farce
to
the
looks
she
threw
to
me
in
order
to
throw
dust
in
my
eyes
they
have
paid
uncommonly
dear
for
all
this
deceit
as
you
will
certainly
think
on
my
conscience
god
pays
more
attention
to
what
goes
on
in
this
world
than
some
of
us
imagine
down
come
the
russians
upon
us
the
country
is
overrun
and
the
campaign
of
begins
in
earnest
one
fine
morning
comes
an
order
we
are
to
be
on
the
battlefield
of
lutzen
by
a
stated
hour
the
emperor
knew
quite
well
what
he
was
about
when
he
ordered
us
to
start
at
once
the
russians
had
turned
our
flank
our
colonel
must
needs
get
himself
into
a
scrape
by
choosing
that
moment
to
take
leave
of
a
polish
lady
who
lived
outside
the
town
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
the
cossack
advanced
guard
just
caught
him
nicely
him
and
his
picket
there
was
scarcely
time
to
spring
into
our
saddles
and
draw
up
before
the
town
so
as
to
engage
in
a
cavalry
skirmish
we
must
check
the
russian
advance
if
we
meant
to
draw
off
during
the
night
again
and
again
we
charged
and
for
three
hours
did
wonders
under
cover
of
the
fighting
the
baggage
and
artillery
set
out
we
had
a
park
of
artillery
and
great
stores
of
powder
of
which
the
emperor
stood
in
desperate
need
they
must
reach
him
at
all
costs
our
resistance
deceived
the
russians
who
thought
at
first
that
we
were
supported
by
an
army
corps
but
before
very
long
they
learned
their
error
from
their
scouts
and
knew
that
they
had
only
a
single
regiment
of
cavalry
to
deal
with
and
the
invalided
foot
soldiers
in
the
depot
on
finding
it
out
sir
they
made
a
murderous
onslaught
on
us
towards
evening
the
action
was
so
hot
that
a
good
few
of
us
were
left
on
the
field
we
were
completely
surrounded
i
was
by
renard
s
side
in
the
front
rank
and
i
saw
how
my
friend
fought
and
charged
like
a
demon
he
was
thinking
of
his
wife
thanks
to
him
we
managed
to
regain
the
town
which
our
invalids
had
put
more
or
less
in
a
state
of
defence
but
it
was
pitiful
to
see
it
we
were
the
last
to
return
he
and
i
a
body
of
cossacks
appeared
in
our
way
and
on
this
we
rode
in
hot
haste
one
of
the
savages
was
about
to
run
me
through
with
a
lance
when
renard
catching
a
sight
of
his
manoeuvre
thrust
his
horse
between
us
to
turn
aside
the
blow
his
poor
brute
a
fine
animal
it
was
upon
my
word
received
the
lance
thrust
and
fell
bringing
down
both
renard
and
the
cossack
with
him
i
killed
the
cossack
seized
renard
by
the
arm
and
laid
him
crosswise
before
me
on
my
horse
like
a
sack
of
wheat
captain
renard
said
it
is
all
over
with
not
yet
i
answered
i
must
have
a
look
at
we
had
reached
the
town
by
that
time
i
dismounted
and
propped
him
up
on
a
little
straw
by
the
corner
of
the
house
a
wound
in
the
head
had
laid
open
the
brain
and
yet
he
spoke
oh
he
was
a
brave
man
we
are
quits
he
said
i
have
given
you
my
life
and
i
had
taken
judith
from
you
take
care
of
her
and
of
her
child
if
she
has
one
and
not
only
so
you
must
marry
i
left
him
then
and
there
sir
like
a
dog
when
the
first
fury
of
anger
left
me
and
i
went
back
again
he
was
dead
the
cossacks
had
set
fire
to
the
town
and
the
thought
of
judith
then
came
to
my
mind
i
went
in
search
of
her
took
her
up
behind
me
in
the
saddle
and
thanks
to
my
swift
horse
caught
up
the
regiment
which
was
effecting
its
retreat
as
for
the
jew
and
his
family
there
was
not
one
of
them
left
they
had
all
disappeared
like
rats
there
was
no
one
but
judith
in
the
house
waiting
alone
there
for
renard
at
first
as
you
can
understand
i
told
her
not
a
word
of
all
that
had
happened
so
it
befell
that
all
through
the
disastrous
campaign
of
i
had
a
woman
to
look
after
to
find
quarters
for
her
and
to
see
that
she
was
comfortable
she
scarcely
knew
i
think
the
straits
to
which
we
were
reduced
i
was
always
careful
to
keep
her
ten
leagues
ahead
of
us
as
we
drew
back
towards
france
her
boy
was
born
while
we
were
fighting
at
hanau
i
was
wounded
in
the
engagement
and
only
rejoined
judith
at
strasburg
then
i
returned
to
paris
for
unluckily
i
was
laid
up
all
through
the
campaign
in
france
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
wretched
mishap
i
should
have
entered
the
grenadier
guards
and
then
the
emperor
would
have
promoted
me
as
it
was
sir
i
had
three
broken
ribs
and
another
man
s
wife
and
child
to
support
my
pay
as
you
can
imagine
was
not
exactly
the
wealth
of
the
indies
renard
s
father
the
toothless
old
shark
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
his
and
the
old
father
jew
had
made
off
judith
was
fretting
herself
to
death
she
cried
one
morning
while
she
was
dressing
my
wound
judith
said
i
your
child
has
nothing
in
this
world
neither
have
i
she
said
pshaw
i
answered
we
will
send
for
all
the
necessary
papers
i
will
marry
you
and
as
for
the
child
i
will
look
on
him
as
mine
i
could
not
say
any
more
ah
my
dear
sir
what
would
not
one
do
for
the
look
by
which
judith
thanked
me
a
look
of
thanks
from
dying
eyes
i
saw
clearly
that
i
had
loved
and
should
love
her
always
and
from
that
day
her
child
found
a
place
in
my
heart
she
died
poor
woman
while
the
father
and
mother
jews
and
the
papers
were
on
the
way
the
day
before
she
died
she
found
strength
enough
to
rise
and
dress
herself
for
her
wedding
to
go
through
all
the
usual
performance
and
set
her
name
to
their
pack
of
papers
then
when
her
child
had
a
name
and
a
father
she
went
back
to
her
bed
again
i
kissed
her
hands
and
her
forehead
and
she
died
that
was
my
wedding
two
days
later
when
i
had
bought
the
few
feet
of
earth
in
which
the
poor
girl
is
laid
i
found
myself
the
father
of
an
orphan
child
i
put
him
out
to
nurse
during
the
campaign
of
ever
since
that
time
without
letting
any
one
know
my
story
which
did
not
sound
very
well
i
have
looked
after
the
little
rogue
as
if
he
were
my
own
child
i
don
t
know
what
became
of
his
grandfather
he
is
wandering
about
a
ruined
man
somewhere
or
other
between
russia
and
persia
the
chances
are
that
he
may
make
a
fortune
some
day
for
he
seemed
to
understand
the
trade
in
precious
stones
i
sent
the
child
to
school
i
wanted
him
to
take
a
good
place
at
the
ecole
polytechnique
and
to
see
him
graduate
there
with
credit
so
of
late
i
have
had
him
drilled
in
mathematics
to
such
good
purpose
that
the
poor
little
soul
has
been
knocked
up
by
it
he
has
a
delicate
chest
by
all
i
can
make
out
from
the
doctors
in
paris
there
would
be
some
hope
for
him
still
if
he
were
allowed
to
run
wild
among
the
hills
if
he
was
properly
cared
for
and
constantly
looked
after
by
somebody
who
was
willing
to
undertake
the
task
so
i
thought
of
you
and
i
came
here
to
take
stock
of
your
ideas
and
your
ways
of
life
after
what
you
have
told
me
i
could
not
possibly
cause
you
pain
in
this
way
for
we
are
good
friends
commandant
said
benassis
after
a
moment
s
pause
bring
judith
s
child
here
to
me
it
is
doubtless
god
s
will
to
submit
me
to
this
final
trial
and
i
will
endure
it
i
will
offer
up
these
sufferings
to
god
whose
son
died
upon
the
cross
besides
your
story
has
awakened
tender
feelings
does
not
that
auger
well
for
me
genestas
took
both
of
benassis
hands
and
pressed
them
warmly
unable
to
check
the
tears
that
filled
his
eyes
and
coursed
down
his
sunburned
face
let
us
keep
silence
with
regard
to
all
this
he
said
yes
commandant
you
are
not
drinking
i
am
not
thirsty
genestas
answered
i
am
a
perfect
fool
well
when
will
you
bring
him
to
me
why
if
you
will
let
me
he
has
been
at
grenoble
these
two
good
set
out
morning
and
come
back
again
i
shall
wait
for
you
in
la
fosseuse
s
cottage
and
we
will
all
four
of
us
breakfast
there
agreed
said
genestas
and
the
two
friends
as
they
went
upstairs
bade
each
other
when
they
reached
the
landing
that
lay
between
their
rooms
genestas
set
down
his
candle
on
the
window
ledge
and
turned
towards
benassis
de
dieu
he
said
with
outspoken
enthusiasm
i
can
not
let
you
go
without
telling
you
that
you
are
the
third
among
christened
men
to
make
me
understand
that
there
is
something
up
there
and
he
pointed
to
the
sky
the
doctor
s
answer
was
a
smile
full
of
sadness
and
a
cordial
grasp
of
the
hand
that
genestas
held
out
to
him
before
daybreak
next
morning
commandant
genestas
was
on
his
way
on
his
return
it
was
noon
before
he
reached
the
spot
on
the
highroad
between
grenoble
and
the
little
town
where
the
pathway
turned
that
led
to
la
fosseuse
s
cottage
he
was
seated
in
one
of
the
light
open
cars
with
four
wheels
drawn
by
one
horse
that
are
in
use
everywhere
on
the
roads
in
these
hilly
districts
genestas
companion
was
a
thin
lad
apparently
about
twelve
years
of
age
though
in
reality
he
was
in
his
sixteenth
year
before
alighting
the
officer
looked
round
about
him
in
several
directions
in
search
of
a
peasant
who
would
take
the
carriage
back
to
benassis
house
it
was
impossible
to
drive
to
la
fosseuse
s
cottage
the
pathway
was
too
narrow
the
happened
to
appear
upon
the
scene
and
helped
genestas
out
of
his
difficulty
so
that
the
officer
and
his
adopted
son
were
at
liberty
to
follow
the
mountain
footpath
that
led
to
the
would
you
not
enjoy
spending
a
year
in
running
about
in
this
lovely
country
adrien
learning
to
hunt
and
to
ride
a
horse
instead
of
growing
pale
over
your
books
stay
look
there
adrien
obediently
glanced
over
the
valley
with
languid
indifference
like
all
lads
of
his
age
he
cared
nothing
for
the
beauty
of
natural
scenery
so
he
only
said
you
are
very
kind
father
without
checking
his
walk
the
invalid
listlessness
of
this
answer
went
to
genestas
heart
he
said
no
more
to
his
son
and
they
reached
la
fosseuse
s
house
in
silence
you
are
punctual
commandant
cried
benassis
rising
from
the
wooden
bench
where
he
was
sitting
but
at
the
sight
of
adrien
he
sat
down
again
and
seemed
for
a
while
to
be
lost
in
thought
in
a
leisurely
fashion
he
scanned
the
lad
s
sallow
weary
face
not
without
admiring
its
delicate
oval
outlines
one
of
the
most
noticeable
characteristics
of
a
noble
head
the
lad
was
the
living
image
of
his
mother
he
had
her
olive
complexion
beautiful
black
eyes
with
a
sad
and
thoughtful
expression
in
them
long
hair
a
head
too
energetic
for
the
fragile
body
all
the
peculiar
beauty
of
the
polish
jewess
had
been
transmitted
to
her
son
do
you
sleep
soundly
my
little
man
benassis
asked
him
yes
let
me
see
your
knees
turn
back
your
adrien
reddened
unfastened
his
garters
and
showed
his
knee
to
the
doctor
who
felt
it
carefully
over
good
now
speak
shout
shout
as
loud
as
you
adrien
obeyed
that
will
do
now
give
me
your
the
lad
held
them
out
white
soft
and
hands
like
those
of
a
woman
where
were
you
at
school
in
paris
at
saint
did
your
master
read
his
breviary
during
the
night
yes
so
you
did
not
go
straight
off
to
sleep
as
adrien
made
no
answer
to
this
genestas
spoke
the
master
is
a
worthy
priest
he
advised
me
to
take
my
little
rascal
away
on
the
score
of
his
health
he
told
the
doctor
well
answered
benassis
with
a
clear
penetrating
gaze
into
adrien
s
frightened
eyes
there
is
a
good
chance
oh
we
shall
make
a
man
of
him
yet
we
will
live
together
like
a
pair
of
comrades
my
boy
we
will
keep
early
hours
i
mean
to
show
this
boy
of
yours
how
to
ride
a
horse
commandant
he
shall
be
put
on
a
milk
diet
for
a
month
or
two
so
as
to
get
his
digestion
into
order
again
and
then
i
will
take
out
a
shooting
license
for
him
and
put
him
in
butifer
s
hands
and
the
two
of
them
shall
have
some
give
your
son
four
or
five
months
of
life
and
you
will
not
know
him
again
commandant
how
delighted
butifer
will
be
i
know
the
fellow
he
will
take
you
over
into
switzerland
my
young
friend
haul
you
over
the
alpine
passes
and
up
the
mountain
peaks
and
add
six
inches
to
your
height
in
six
months
he
will
put
some
color
into
your
cheeks
and
brace
your
nerves
and
make
you
forget
all
these
bad
ways
that
you
have
fallen
into
at
school
and
after
that
you
can
go
back
to
your
work
and
you
will
be
a
man
some
of
these
days
butifer
is
an
honest
young
fellow
we
can
trust
him
with
the
money
necessary
for
traveling
expenses
and
your
hunting
expeditions
the
responsibility
will
keep
him
steady
for
six
months
and
that
will
be
a
very
good
thing
for
genestas
face
brightened
more
and
more
at
every
word
the
doctor
spoke
now
let
us
go
in
to
breakfast
la
fosseuse
is
very
anxious
to
see
you
said
benassis
giving
adrien
a
gentle
tap
on
the
cheek
genestas
took
the
doctor
s
arm
and
drew
him
a
little
aside
then
he
is
not
consumptive
after
all
he
asked
no
more
than
you
or
then
what
is
the
matter
with
him
pshaw
answered
benassis
he
is
a
little
run
down
that
is
la
fosseuse
appeared
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
and
genestas
noticed
not
without
surprise
her
simple
but
coquettish
costume
this
was
not
the
peasant
girl
of
yesterday
evening
but
a
graceful
and
parisian
woman
against
whose
glances
he
felt
that
he
was
not
proof
the
soldier
turned
his
eyes
on
the
table
which
was
made
of
walnut
wood
there
was
no
tablecloth
but
the
surface
might
have
been
varnished
it
was
so
well
rubbed
and
polished
eggs
butter
a
rice
pudding
and
fragrant
wild
strawberries
had
been
set
out
and
the
poor
child
had
put
flowers
everywhere
about
the
room
evidently
it
was
a
great
day
for
her
at
the
sight
of
all
this
the
commandant
could
not
help
looking
enviously
at
the
little
house
and
the
green
sward
about
it
and
watched
the
peasant
girl
with
an
air
that
expressed
both
his
doubts
and
his
hopes
then
his
eyes
fell
on
adrien
with
whom
la
fosseuse
was
deliberately
busying
herself
and
handing
him
the
eggs
now
commandant
said
benassis
you
know
the
terms
on
which
you
are
receiving
hospitality
you
must
tell
la
fosseuse
something
about
the
but
let
the
gentleman
first
have
his
breakfast
in
peace
and
then
after
he
has
taken
a
cup
of
coffee
by
all
means
i
shall
be
very
glad
answered
the
commandant
but
it
must
be
upon
one
condition
you
will
tell
us
the
story
of
some
adventure
in
your
past
life
will
you
not
mademoiselle
why
nothing
worth
telling
has
ever
happened
to
me
sir
she
answered
as
her
color
rose
will
you
take
a
little
more
rice
pudding
she
added
as
she
saw
that
adrien
s
plate
was
empty
if
you
please
the
pudding
is
delicious
said
genestas
then
what
will
you
say
to
her
coffee
and
cream
cried
benassis
i
would
rather
hear
our
pretty
hostess
you
did
not
put
that
nicely
genestas
said
benassis
he
took
la
fosseuse
s
hand
in
his
and
pressed
it
as
he
went
on
listen
my
child
there
is
a
kind
heart
hidden
away
beneath
that
officer
s
stern
exterior
and
you
can
talk
freely
before
him
we
do
not
want
to
press
you
to
talk
do
not
tell
us
anything
unless
you
like
but
if
ever
you
can
be
listened
to
and
understood
poor
little
one
it
will
be
by
the
three
who
are
with
you
now
at
this
moment
tell
us
all
about
your
love
affairs
in
the
old
days
that
will
not
admit
us
into
any
of
the
real
secrets
of
your
here
is
mariette
with
the
coffee
she
answered
and
as
soon
as
you
are
all
served
i
will
tell
about
my
love
affairs
very
willingly
but
le
commandant
will
not
forget
his
promise
she
added
challenging
the
officer
with
a
shy
glance
that
would
be
impossible
mademoiselle
genestas
answered
respectfully
when
i
was
sixteen
years
old
la
fosseuse
began
i
had
to
beg
my
bread
on
the
roadside
in
savoy
though
my
health
was
very
bad
i
used
to
sleep
at
echelles
in
a
manger
full
of
straw
the
innkeeper
who
gave
me
shelter
was
kind
but
his
wife
could
not
abide
me
and
was
always
saying
hard
things
i
used
to
feel
very
miserable
for
though
i
was
a
beggar
i
was
not
a
naughty
child
i
used
to
say
my
prayers
every
night
and
morning
i
never
stole
anything
and
i
did
as
heaven
bade
me
in
begging
for
my
living
for
there
was
nothing
that
i
could
turn
my
hands
to
and
i
was
really
unfit
for
work
quite
unable
to
handle
a
hoe
or
to
wind
spools
of
cotton
well
they
drove
me
away
from
the
inn
at
last
a
dog
was
the
cause
of
it
all
i
had
neither
father
nor
mother
nor
friends
i
had
met
with
no
one
ever
since
i
was
born
whose
eyes
had
any
kindness
in
them
for
me
morin
the
old
woman
who
had
brought
me
up
was
dead
she
had
been
very
good
to
me
but
i
can
not
remember
that
she
ever
petted
me
much
besides
she
worked
out
in
the
fields
like
a
man
poor
thing
and
if
she
fondled
me
at
times
she
also
used
to
rap
my
fingers
with
the
spoon
if
i
ate
the
soup
too
fast
out
of
the
porringer
we
had
between
us
poor
old
woman
never
a
day
passes
but
i
remember
her
in
my
prayers
if
it
might
please
god
to
let
her
live
a
happier
life
up
there
than
she
did
here
below
and
above
all
things
if
she
might
only
lie
a
little
softer
there
for
she
was
always
grumbling
about
the
that
we
both
used
to
sleep
upon
you
could
not
possibly
imagine
how
it
hurts
one
s
soul
to
be
repulsed
by
every
one
to
receive
nothing
but
hard
words
and
looks
that
cut
you
to
the
heart
just
as
if
they
were
so
many
stabs
of
a
knife
i
have
known
poor
old
people
who
were
so
used
to
these
things
that
they
did
not
mind
them
a
bit
but
i
was
not
born
for
that
sort
of
life
a
no
always
made
me
cry
every
evening
i
came
back
again
more
unhappy
than
ever
and
only
felt
comforted
when
i
had
said
my
prayers
in
all
god
s
world
in
fact
there
was
not
a
soul
to
care
for
me
no
one
to
whom
i
could
pour
out
my
heart
my
only
friend
was
the
blue
sky
i
have
always
been
happy
when
there
was
a
cloudless
sky
above
my
head
i
used
to
lie
and
watch
the
weather
from
some
nook
among
the
crags
when
the
wind
had
swept
the
clouds
away
at
such
times
i
used
to
dream
that
i
was
a
great
lady
i
used
to
gaze
into
the
sky
till
i
felt
myself
bathed
in
the
blue
i
lived
up
there
in
thought
rising
higher
and
higher
yet
till
my
troubles
weighed
on
me
no
more
and
there
was
nothing
but
gladness
left
but
to
return
to
my
love
i
must
tell
you
that
the
innkeeper
s
spaniel
had
a
dear
little
puppy
just
as
sensible
as
a
human
being
he
was
quite
white
with
black
spots
on
his
paws
a
cherub
of
a
puppy
i
can
see
him
yet
poor
little
fellow
he
was
the
only
creature
who
ever
gave
me
a
friendly
look
in
those
days
i
kept
all
my
tidbits
for
him
he
knew
me
and
came
to
look
for
me
every
evening
how
he
used
to
spring
up
at
me
and
he
would
bite
my
feet
he
was
not
ashamed
of
my
poverty
there
was
something
so
grateful
and
so
kind
in
his
eyes
that
it
brought
tears
into
mine
to
see
it
that
is
the
one
living
creature
that
really
cares
for
me
i
used
to
say
he
slept
at
my
feet
that
winter
it
hurt
me
so
much
to
see
him
beaten
that
i
broke
him
of
the
habit
of
going
into
houses
to
steal
bones
and
he
was
quite
contented
with
my
crusts
when
i
was
unhappy
he
used
to
come
and
stand
in
front
of
me
and
look
into
my
eyes
it
was
just
as
if
he
said
so
you
are
sad
my
poor
fosseuse
if
a
traveler
threw
me
some
halfpence
he
would
pick
them
up
out
of
the
dust
and
bring
them
to
me
clever
little
spaniel
that
he
was
i
was
less
miserable
so
long
as
i
had
that
friend
every
day
i
put
away
a
few
halfpence
for
i
wanted
to
get
fifteen
francs
together
so
that
i
might
buy
him
of
pere
manseau
one
day
his
wife
saw
that
the
dog
was
fond
of
me
so
she
herself
took
a
sudden
violent
fancy
to
him
the
dog
mind
you
could
not
bear
her
oh
animals
know
people
by
instinct
if
you
really
care
for
them
they
find
it
out
in
a
moment
i
had
a
gold
coin
a
piece
sewed
into
the
band
of
my
skirt
so
i
spoke
to
manseau
dear
sir
i
meant
to
offer
you
my
year
s
savings
for
your
dog
but
now
your
wife
has
a
mind
to
keep
him
although
she
cares
very
little
about
him
and
rather
than
that
will
you
sell
him
to
me
for
twenty
francs
look
i
have
the
money
no
no
little
woman
he
said
put
up
your
twenty
francs
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
take
their
money
from
the
poor
keep
the
dog
and
if
my
wife
makes
a
fuss
about
it
you
must
go
his
wife
made
a
terrible
about
the
dog
ah
any
one
might
have
thought
the
house
was
on
fire
you
never
would
guess
the
notion
that
next
came
into
her
head
she
saw
that
the
little
fellow
looked
on
me
as
his
mistress
and
that
she
could
only
have
him
against
his
will
so
she
had
him
poisoned
and
my
poor
spaniel
died
in
my
arms
i
cried
over
him
as
if
he
had
been
my
child
and
buried
him
under
a
you
do
not
know
all
that
i
laid
in
that
grave
as
i
sat
there
beside
it
i
told
myself
that
henceforward
i
should
always
be
alone
in
the
world
that
i
had
nothing
left
to
hope
for
that
i
should
be
again
as
i
had
been
before
a
poor
lonely
girl
that
i
should
never
more
see
a
friendly
light
in
any
eyes
i
stayed
out
there
all
through
the
night
praying
god
to
have
pity
on
me
when
i
went
back
to
the
highroad
i
saw
a
poor
little
child
about
ten
years
old
who
had
no
hands
god
has
heard
me
i
thought
i
had
prayed
that
night
as
i
had
never
prayed
before
i
will
take
care
of
the
poor
little
one
we
will
beg
together
and
i
will
be
a
mother
to
him
two
of
us
ought
to
do
better
than
one
perhaps
i
should
have
more
courage
for
him
than
i
have
for
at
first
the
little
boy
seemed
to
be
quite
happy
and
indeed
he
would
have
been
hard
to
please
if
he
had
not
been
content
i
did
everything
that
he
wanted
and
gave
him
the
best
of
all
that
i
had
i
was
his
slave
in
fact
and
he
tyrannized
over
me
but
that
was
nicer
than
being
alone
i
used
to
think
pshaw
no
sooner
did
the
little
know
that
i
carried
a
piece
sewed
into
my
skirtband
than
he
cut
the
stitches
and
stole
my
gold
coin
the
price
of
my
poor
spaniel
i
had
meant
to
have
masses
said
with
it
a
child
without
hands
too
oh
it
makes
one
shudder
somehow
that
theft
took
all
the
heart
out
of
me
it
seemed
as
if
i
was
to
love
nothing
but
it
should
come
to
some
wretched
end
one
day
at
echelles
i
watched
a
fine
carriage
coming
slowly
up
the
hillside
there
was
a
young
lady
as
beautiful
as
the
virgin
mary
in
the
carriage
and
a
young
man
who
looked
like
the
young
lady
just
look
he
said
there
is
a
pretty
girl
and
he
flung
a
silver
coin
to
me
no
one
but
you
benassis
could
understand
how
pleased
i
was
with
the
compliment
the
first
that
i
had
ever
had
but
indeed
the
gentleman
ought
not
to
have
thrown
the
money
to
me
i
was
in
a
flutter
i
knew
of
a
short
cut
a
footpath
among
the
rocks
and
started
at
once
to
run
so
that
i
reached
the
summit
of
the
echelles
long
before
the
carriage
which
was
coming
up
very
slowly
i
saw
the
young
man
again
he
was
quite
surprised
to
find
me
there
and
as
for
me
i
was
so
pleased
that
my
heart
seemed
to
be
throbbing
in
my
throat
some
kind
of
instinct
drew
me
towards
him
after
he
had
recognized
me
i
went
on
my
way
again
i
felt
quite
sure
that
he
and
the
young
lady
with
him
would
leave
the
carriage
to
see
the
waterfall
at
couz
and
so
they
did
when
they
alighted
they
saw
me
once
more
under
the
by
the
wayside
they
asked
me
many
questions
and
seemed
to
take
an
interest
in
what
i
told
them
about
myself
in
all
my
life
i
had
never
heard
such
pleasant
voices
as
they
had
that
handsome
young
man
and
his
sister
for
she
was
his
sister
i
am
sure
i
thought
about
them
for
a
whole
year
afterwards
and
kept
on
hoping
that
they
would
come
back
i
would
have
given
two
years
of
my
life
only
to
see
that
traveler
again
he
looked
so
nice
until
i
knew
benassis
these
were
the
greatest
events
of
my
life
although
my
mistress
turned
me
away
for
trying
on
that
horrid
of
hers
i
was
sorry
for
her
and
i
have
forgiven
her
for
candidly
if
you
will
give
me
leave
to
say
so
i
thought
myself
the
better
woman
of
the
two
countess
though
she
well
said
genestas
after
a
moment
s
pause
you
see
that
providence
has
kept
a
friendly
eye
on
you
you
are
in
clover
at
these
words
la
fosseuse
looked
at
benassis
with
eyes
full
of
gratitude
would
that
i
was
rich
came
from
genestas
the
officer
s
exclamation
was
followed
by
profound
silence
you
owe
me
a
story
said
la
fosseuse
at
last
in
coaxing
tones
i
will
tell
it
at
once
answered
genestas
on
the
evening
before
the
battle
of
friedland
he
went
on
after
a
moment
i
had
been
sent
with
a
despatch
to
general
davoust
s
quarters
and
i
was
on
the
way
back
to
my
own
when
at
a
turn
in
the
road
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
the
emperor
napoleon
gave
me
a
look
you
are
captain
genestas
are
you
not
he
said
yes
your
you
were
out
in
egypt
yes
your
you
had
better
not
keep
to
the
road
you
are
on
he
said
turn
to
the
left
you
will
reach
your
division
sooner
that
that
was
what
the
emperor
said
but
you
would
never
imagine
how
kindly
he
said
it
and
he
had
so
many
irons
in
the
fire
just
then
for
he
was
riding
about
surveying
the
position
of
the
field
i
am
telling
you
this
story
to
show
you
what
a
memory
he
had
and
so
that
you
may
know
that
he
knew
my
face
i
took
the
oath
in
but
for
that
mistake
perhaps
i
might
have
been
a
colonel
i
never
meant
to
betray
the
bourbons
france
must
be
defended
and
that
was
all
i
thought
about
i
was
a
major
in
the
grenadiers
of
the
imperial
guard
and
although
my
wound
still
gave
me
trouble
i
swung
a
sabre
in
the
battle
of
waterloo
when
it
was
all
over
and
napoleon
returned
to
paris
i
went
too
then
when
he
reached
rochefort
i
followed
him
against
his
orders
it
was
some
sort
of
comfort
to
watch
over
him
and
to
see
that
no
mishap
befell
him
on
the
way
so
when
he
was
walking
along
the
beach
he
turned
and
saw
me
on
duty
ten
paces
from
him
well
genestas
he
said
as
he
came
towards
me
so
we
are
not
yet
dead
either
of
us
it
cut
me
to
the
heart
to
hear
him
say
that
if
you
had
heard
him
you
would
have
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
as
i
did
he
pointed
to
the
villainous
english
vessel
that
was
keeping
the
entrance
to
the
harbor
when
i
see
he
said
and
think
of
my
guard
i
wish
that
i
had
perished
in
that
torrent
of
yes
said
genestas
looking
at
the
doctor
and
at
la
fosseuse
those
were
his
very
words
the
generals
who
counseled
you
not
to
charge
with
the
guard
and
who
hurried
you
into
your
traveling
carriage
were
not
true
friends
of
yours
i
said
come
with
me
he
cried
eagerly
the
game
is
not
ended
i
would
gladly
go
with
your
majesty
but
i
am
not
free
i
have
a
motherless
child
on
my
hands
just
and
so
it
happened
that
adrien
over
there
prevented
me
from
going
to
helena
stay
he
said
i
have
never
given
you
anything
you
are
not
one
of
those
who
fill
one
hand
and
then
hold
out
the
other
here
is
the
that
i
have
used
though
this
last
campaign
and
stay
on
in
france
after
all
brave
men
are
wanted
there
remain
in
the
service
and
keep
me
in
remembrance
of
all
my
army
in
egypt
you
are
the
last
that
i
have
seen
still
on
his
legs
in
and
he
gave
me
a
little
have
et
engraved
on
it
he
said
the
history
of
our
last
two
campaigns
is
summed
up
in
those
three
then
those
who
were
going
out
with
him
came
up
and
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
morning
with
them
the
emperor
walked
to
and
fro
along
the
beach
there
was
not
a
sign
of
agitation
about
him
though
he
frowned
from
time
to
time
at
noon
it
was
considered
hopeless
for
him
to
attempt
to
escape
by
sea
the
english
had
found
out
that
he
was
at
rochefort
he
must
either
give
himself
up
to
them
or
cross
the
breadth
of
france
again
we
were
wretchedly
anxious
the
minutes
seemed
like
hours
on
the
one
hand
there
were
the
bourbons
who
would
have
shot
napoleon
if
he
had
fallen
into
their
clutches
and
on
the
other
the
english
a
dishonored
race
they
covered
themselves
with
shame
by
flinging
a
foe
who
asked
for
hospitality
away
on
a
desert
rock
that
is
a
stain
which
they
will
never
wash
away
whilst
they
were
anxiously
debating
some
one
or
other
among
his
suite
presented
a
sailor
to
him
a
lieutenant
doret
who
had
a
scheme
for
reaching
america
to
lay
before
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
brig
from
the
states
and
a
merchant
vessel
were
lying
in
the
harbor
but
how
could
you
set
about
it
captain
the
emperor
asked
him
you
will
be
on
board
the
merchant
vessel
sire
the
man
answered
i
will
run
up
the
white
flag
and
man
the
brig
with
a
few
devoted
followers
we
will
tackle
the
english
vessel
set
fire
to
her
and
board
her
and
you
will
get
clear
we
will
go
with
you
i
cried
to
the
captain
but
napoleon
looked
at
us
and
said
captain
doret
keep
yourself
for
it
was
the
only
time
i
ever
saw
napoleon
show
any
emotion
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
to
us
he
went
in
again
i
watched
him
go
on
board
the
english
vessel
and
then
i
went
away
it
was
all
over
with
him
and
he
knew
it
there
was
a
traitor
in
the
harbor
who
by
means
of
signals
gave
warning
to
the
emperor
s
enemies
of
his
presence
then
napoleon
fell
back
on
a
last
resource
he
did
as
he
had
been
wont
to
do
on
the
battlefield
he
went
to
his
foes
instead
of
letting
them
come
to
him
talk
of
troubles
no
words
could
ever
make
you
understand
the
misery
of
those
who
loved
him
for
his
own
but
where
is
his
asked
la
fosseuse
it
is
in
a
box
at
grenoble
the
commandant
replied
i
will
go
over
to
see
it
if
you
will
let
me
to
think
that
you
have
something
in
your
possession
that
his
fingers
have
touched
had
he
a
hand
can
it
be
true
that
he
is
dead
come
tell
me
the
real
truth
yes
my
dear
child
he
is
dead
there
is
no
doubt
about
i
was
such
a
little
girl
in
i
was
not
tall
enough
to
see
anything
but
his
hat
and
even
so
i
was
nearly
crushed
to
death
in
the
crowd
at
your
coffee
and
cream
is
very
nice
indeed
said
genestas
well
adrien
how
do
you
like
this
country
will
you
come
here
to
see
mademoiselle
the
boy
made
no
answer
he
seemed
afraid
to
look
at
la
fosseuse
benassis
never
took
his
eyes
off
adrien
he
appeared
to
be
reading
the
lad
s
very
soul
of
course
he
will
come
to
see
her
said
benassis
but
let
us
go
home
again
i
have
a
pretty
long
round
to
make
and
i
shall
want
a
horse
i
daresay
you
and
jacquotte
will
manage
to
get
on
together
whilst
i
am
will
you
not
come
with
us
said
genestas
to
la
fosseuse
willingly
she
answered
i
have
a
lot
of
things
to
take
over
for
mme
they
started
out
for
the
doctor
s
house
her
visitors
had
raised
la
fosseuse
s
spirits
she
led
the
way
along
narrow
tracks
through
the
loneliest
parts
of
the
hills
you
have
told
us
nothing
about
yourself
monsieur
l
officier
she
said
i
should
have
liked
to
hear
you
tell
us
about
some
adventure
in
the
wars
i
liked
what
you
told
us
about
napoleon
very
much
but
it
made
me
feel
sad
if
you
would
be
so
very
kind
quite
right
benassis
exclaimed
you
ought
to
tell
us
about
some
thrilling
adventure
during
our
walk
come
now
something
really
interesting
like
that
business
of
the
beam
in
beresina
so
few
of
my
recollections
are
worth
telling
said
genestas
some
people
come
in
for
all
kinds
of
adventures
but
i
have
never
managed
to
be
the
hero
of
any
story
oh
stop
a
bit
though
a
funny
thing
did
once
happen
to
me
i
was
with
the
grand
army
in
and
so
of
course
i
was
at
austerlitz
there
was
a
great
deal
of
skirmishing
just
before
ulm
surrendered
which
kept
the
cavalry
pretty
fully
occupied
moreover
we
were
under
the
command
of
murat
who
never
let
the
grass
grow
under
his
feet
i
was
still
only
a
in
those
days
it
was
just
at
the
opening
of
the
campaign
and
after
one
of
these
affairs
that
we
took
possession
of
a
district
in
which
there
were
a
good
many
fine
estates
so
it
fell
out
that
one
evening
my
regiment
bivouacked
in
a
park
belonging
to
a
handsome
chateau
where
a
countess
lived
a
young
and
pretty
woman
she
was
of
course
i
meant
to
lodge
in
the
house
and
i
hurried
there
to
put
a
stop
to
pillage
of
any
sort
i
came
into
the
salon
just
as
my
quartermaster
was
pointing
his
carbine
at
the
countess
his
brutal
way
of
asking
for
what
she
certainly
could
not
give
the
ugly
scoundrel
i
struck
up
his
carbine
with
my
sword
the
bullet
went
through
a
on
the
wall
then
i
dealt
my
gentleman
a
blow
that
stretched
him
on
the
floor
the
sound
of
the
shot
and
the
cries
of
the
countess
fetched
all
her
people
on
the
scene
and
it
was
my
turn
to
be
in
danger
stop
she
cried
in
german
for
they
were
going
to
run
me
through
the
body
this
officer
has
saved
my
life
they
drew
back
at
that
the
lady
gave
me
her
handkerchief
a
fine
embroidered
handkerchief
which
i
have
yet
telling
me
that
her
house
would
always
be
open
to
me
and
that
i
should
always
find
a
sister
and
a
devoted
friend
in
her
if
at
any
time
i
should
be
in
any
sort
of
trouble
in
short
she
did
not
know
how
to
make
enough
of
me
she
was
as
fair
as
a
wedding
morning
and
as
charming
as
a
kitten
we
had
dinner
together
next
day
i
was
distractedly
in
love
but
next
day
i
had
to
be
at
my
place
at
guntzburg
or
wherever
it
was
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
had
to
turn
out
and
started
off
with
my
handkerchief
well
we
gave
them
battle
and
all
the
time
i
kept
on
saying
to
myself
i
wish
a
bullet
would
come
my
way
they
are
flying
thick
enough
i
had
no
wish
for
a
ball
in
the
thigh
for
i
should
have
had
to
stop
where
i
was
in
that
case
and
there
would
have
been
no
going
back
to
the
chateau
but
i
was
not
particular
a
nice
wound
in
the
arm
i
should
have
liked
best
so
that
i
might
be
nursed
and
made
much
of
by
the
princess
i
flung
myself
on
the
enemy
like
mad
but
i
had
no
sort
of
luck
and
came
out
of
the
action
quite
safe
and
sound
we
must
march
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
i
never
saw
the
countess
again
and
there
is
the
whole
by
this
time
they
had
reached
benassis
house
the
doctor
mounted
his
horse
at
once
and
disappeared
genestas
recommended
his
son
to
jacquotte
s
care
so
the
doctor
on
his
return
found
that
she
had
taken
adrien
completely
under
her
wing
and
had
installed
him
in
gravier
s
celebrated
room
with
no
small
astonishment
she
heard
her
master
s
order
to
put
up
a
simple
in
his
own
room
for
that
the
lad
was
to
sleep
there
and
this
in
such
an
authoritative
tone
that
for
once
in
her
life
jacquotte
found
not
a
single
word
to
say
after
dinner
the
commandant
went
back
to
grenoble
benassis
reiterated
assurances
that
the
lad
would
soon
be
restored
to
health
had
taken
a
weight
off
his
mind
eight
months
later
in
the
earliest
days
of
the
following
december
genestas
was
appointed
to
be
of
a
regiment
stationed
at
poitiers
he
was
just
thinking
of
writing
to
benassis
to
tell
him
of
the
journey
he
was
about
to
take
when
a
letter
came
from
the
doctor
his
friend
told
him
that
adrien
was
once
more
in
sound
health
the
boy
has
grown
strong
and
tall
he
said
and
he
is
wonderfully
well
he
has
profited
by
butifer
s
instruction
since
you
saw
him
last
and
is
now
as
good
a
shot
as
our
smuggler
himself
he
has
grown
brisk
and
active
too
he
is
a
good
walker
and
rides
well
he
is
not
in
the
least
like
the
lad
of
sixteen
who
looked
like
a
boy
of
twelve
eight
months
ago
any
one
might
think
that
he
was
twenty
years
old
there
is
an
air
of
and
independence
about
him
in
fact
he
is
a
man
now
and
you
must
begin
to
think
about
his
future
at
i
shall
go
over
to
benassis
of
course
said
genestas
to
himself
and
i
will
see
what
he
says
before
i
make
up
my
mind
what
to
do
with
that
fellow
and
with
that
he
went
to
a
farewell
dinner
given
to
him
by
his
brother
officers
he
would
be
leaving
grenoble
now
in
a
very
few
days
as
the
returned
after
the
dinner
his
servant
handed
him
a
letter
it
had
been
brought
by
a
messenger
he
said
who
had
waited
a
long
while
for
an
answer
genestas
recognized
adrien
s
handwriting
although
his
head
was
swimming
after
the
toasts
that
had
been
drunk
in
his
honor
probably
he
thought
the
letter
merely
contained
a
request
to
gratify
some
boyish
whim
so
he
left
it
unopened
on
the
table
the
next
morning
when
the
fumes
of
champagne
had
passed
off
he
took
it
up
and
began
to
read
my
dear
father
oh
you
young
rogue
was
his
comment
you
know
how
to
coax
whenever
you
want
our
dear
benassis
is
dead
the
letter
dropped
from
genestas
hands
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
read
any
more
every
one
is
in
consternation
the
trouble
is
all
the
greater
because
it
came
as
a
sudden
shock
it
was
so
unexpected
benassis
seemed
perfectly
well
the
day
before
there
was
not
a
sign
of
about
him
only
the
day
before
yesterday
he
went
to
see
all
his
patients
even
those
who
lived
farthest
away
it
was
as
if
he
had
known
what
was
going
to
happen
and
he
spoke
to
every
one
whom
he
met
saying
my
friends
each
time
towards
five
o
clock
he
came
back
just
as
usual
to
have
dinner
with
me
he
was
tired
jacquotte
noticed
the
purplish
flush
on
his
face
but
the
weather
was
so
very
cold
that
she
would
not
get
ready
a
warm
for
him
as
she
usually
did
when
she
saw
that
the
blood
had
gone
to
his
head
so
she
has
been
wailing
poor
thing
through
her
tears
for
these
two
days
past
if
i
had
given
him
a
he
would
be
living
now
m
benassis
was
hungry
he
made
a
good
dinner
i
thought
that
he
was
in
higher
spirits
than
usual
we
both
of
us
laughed
a
great
deal
i
had
never
seen
him
laugh
so
much
before
after
dinner
towards
seven
o
clock
a
man
came
with
a
message
from
saint
laurent
du
pont
it
was
a
serious
case
and
benassis
was
urgently
needed
he
said
to
me
i
shall
have
to
go
though
i
never
care
to
set
out
on
horseback
when
i
have
hardly
digested
my
dinner
more
especially
when
it
is
as
cold
as
this
it
is
enough
to
kill
a
man
for
all
that
he
went
at
nine
o
clock
the
postman
goguelat
brought
a
letter
for
benassis
jacquotte
was
tired
out
for
it
was
her
she
gave
me
the
letter
and
went
off
to
bed
she
begged
me
to
keep
a
good
fire
in
our
bedroom
and
to
have
some
tea
ready
for
benassis
when
he
came
in
for
i
am
still
sleeping
in
the
little
in
his
room
i
raked
out
the
fire
in
the
salon
and
went
upstairs
to
wait
for
my
good
friend
i
looked
at
the
letter
out
of
curiosity
before
i
laid
it
on
the
and
noticed
the
handwriting
and
the
postmark
it
came
from
paris
and
i
think
it
was
a
lady
s
hand
i
am
telling
you
about
it
because
of
things
that
happened
afterwards
about
ten
o
clock
i
heard
the
horse
returning
and
benassis
voice
he
said
to
nicolle
it
is
cold
enough
to
bring
the
wolves
out
i
do
not
feel
at
all
nicolle
said
shall
i
go
and
wake
jacquotte
and
benassis
answered
oh
no
no
and
came
upstairs
i
said
i
have
your
tea
here
all
ready
for
you
and
he
smiled
at
me
in
the
way
that
you
know
and
said
thank
you
that
was
his
last
smile
in
a
moment
he
began
to
take
off
his
cravat
as
though
he
could
not
breathe
how
hot
it
is
in
here
he
said
and
flung
himself
down
in
an
armchair
a
letter
has
come
for
you
my
good
friend
i
said
here
it
is
and
i
gave
him
the
letter
he
took
it
up
and
glanced
at
the
handwriting
ah
he
exclaimed
perhaps
she
is
free
at
last
then
his
head
sank
back
and
his
hands
shook
after
a
little
while
he
set
the
lamp
on
the
table
and
opened
the
letter
there
was
something
so
alarming
in
the
cry
he
had
given
that
i
watched
him
while
he
read
and
saw
that
his
face
was
flushed
and
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
then
quite
suddenly
he
fell
head
forwards
i
tried
to
raise
him
and
saw
how
purple
his
face
was
it
is
all
over
with
me
he
said
stammering
it
was
terrible
to
see
how
he
struggled
to
rise
i
must
be
bled
bleed
me
he
cried
clutching
my
hand
adrien
he
said
again
burn
this
letter
he
gave
it
to
me
and
i
threw
it
on
the
fire
i
called
for
jacquotte
and
nicolle
jacquotte
did
not
hear
me
but
nicolle
did
and
came
hurrying
upstairs
he
helped
me
to
lay
benassis
on
my
little
bed
our
dear
friend
could
not
hear
us
any
longer
when
we
spoke
to
him
and
although
his
eyes
were
open
he
did
not
see
anything
nicolle
galloped
off
at
once
to
fetch
the
surgeon
bordier
and
in
this
way
spread
the
alarm
through
the
town
it
was
all
astir
in
a
moment
janvier
dufau
and
all
the
rest
of
your
acquaintance
were
the
first
to
come
to
us
but
all
hope
was
at
an
end
benassis
was
dying
fast
he
gave
no
sign
of
consciousness
not
even
when
bordier
cauterized
the
soles
of
his
feet
it
was
an
attack
of
gout
combined
with
an
apoplectic
stroke
i
am
giving
you
all
these
details
dear
father
because
i
know
how
much
you
cared
for
him
as
for
me
i
am
very
sad
and
full
of
grief
for
i
can
say
to
you
that
i
cared
more
for
him
than
for
any
one
else
except
you
i
learned
more
from
benassis
talk
in
the
evenings
than
ever
i
could
have
learned
at
school
you
can
not
imagine
the
scene
next
morning
when
the
news
of
his
death
was
known
in
the
place
the
garden
and
the
yard
here
were
filled
with
people
how
they
sobbed
and
wailed
nobody
did
any
work
that
day
every
one
recalled
the
last
time
that
they
had
seen
benassis
and
what
he
had
said
or
they
talked
of
all
that
he
had
done
for
them
and
those
who
were
least
overcome
with
grief
spoke
for
the
others
every
one
wanted
to
see
him
once
more
and
the
crowd
grew
larger
every
moment
the
sad
news
traveled
so
fast
that
men
and
women
and
children
came
from
ten
leagues
round
all
the
people
in
the
district
and
even
beyond
it
had
that
one
thought
in
their
minds
it
was
arranged
that
four
of
the
oldest
men
of
the
commune
should
carry
the
coffin
it
was
a
very
difficult
task
for
them
for
the
crowd
was
so
dense
between
the
church
and
benassis
house
there
must
have
been
nearly
five
thousand
people
there
and
almost
every
one
knelt
as
if
the
host
were
passing
there
was
not
nearly
room
for
them
in
the
church
in
spite
of
their
grief
the
crowd
was
so
silent
that
you
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
bell
during
mass
and
the
chanting
as
far
as
the
end
of
the
high
street
but
when
the
procession
started
again
for
the
new
cemetery
which
benassis
had
given
to
the
town
little
thinking
poor
man
that
he
himself
would
be
the
first
to
be
buried
there
a
great
cry
went
up
janvier
wept
as
he
said
the
prayers
there
were
no
dry
eyes
among
the
crowd
and
so
we
buried
him
as
night
came
on
the
people
dispersed
carrying
sorrow
and
mourning
everywhere
with
them
the
next
day
gondrin
and
goguelat
and
butifer
with
others
set
to
work
to
raise
a
sort
of
pyramid
of
earth
twenty
feet
high
above
the
spot
where
benassis
lies
it
is
being
covered
now
with
green
sods
and
every
one
is
helping
them
these
things
dear
father
have
all
happened
in
three
days
m
dufau
found
benassis
will
lying
open
on
the
table
where
he
used
to
write
when
it
was
known
how
his
property
had
been
left
affection
and
regret
for
his
loss
became
even
deeper
if
possible
and
now
dear
father
i
am
writing
for
butifer
who
is
taking
this
letter
to
you
to
come
back
with
your
answer
you
must
tell
me
what
i
am
to
do
will
you
come
to
fetch
me
or
shall
i
go
to
you
at
grenoble
tell
me
what
you
wish
me
to
do
and
be
sure
that
i
shall
obey
you
in
everything
farewell
dear
father
i
send
my
love
and
i
am
your
affectionate
son
adrien
ah
well
i
must
go
over
the
soldier
exclaimed
he
ordered
his
horse
and
started
out
it
was
one
of
those
still
december
mornings
when
the
sky
is
covered
with
gray
clouds
the
wind
was
too
light
to
disperse
the
thick
fog
through
which
the
bare
trees
and
damp
house
fronts
seemed
strangely
unfamiliar
the
very
silence
was
gloomy
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
silence
full
of
light
and
gladness
on
a
bright
day
there
is
a
certain
joyousness
about
the
slightest
sound
but
in
such
dreary
weather
nature
is
not
silent
she
is
dumb
all
sounds
seemed
to
die
away
stifled
by
the
heavy
air
there
was
something
in
the
gloom
without
him
that
harmonized
with
colonel
genestas
mood
his
heart
was
oppressed
with
grief
and
thoughts
of
death
filled
his
mind
involuntarily
he
began
to
think
of
the
cloudless
sky
on
that
lovely
spring
morning
and
remembered
how
bright
the
valley
had
looked
when
he
passed
through
it
for
the
first
time
and
now
in
strong
contrast
with
that
day
the
heavy
sky
above
him
was
a
leaden
gray
there
was
no
greenness
about
the
hills
which
were
still
waiting
for
the
cloak
of
winter
snow
that
invests
them
with
a
certain
beauty
of
its
own
there
was
something
painful
in
all
this
bleak
and
bare
desolation
for
a
man
who
was
traveling
to
find
a
grave
at
his
journey
s
end
the
thought
of
that
grave
haunted
him
the
lines
of
dark
here
and
there
along
the
mountain
ridges
against
the
sky
seized
on
his
imagination
they
were
in
keeping
with
the
officer
s
mournful
musings
every
time
that
he
looked
over
the
valley
that
lay
before
him
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
trouble
that
had
befallen
the
canton
of
the
man
who
had
died
so
lately
and
of
the
blank
left
by
his
death
before
long
genestas
reached
the
cottage
where
he
had
asked
for
a
cup
of
milk
on
his
first
journey
the
sight
of
the
smoke
rising
above
the
hovel
where
the
were
being
brought
up
recalled
vivid
memories
of
benassis
and
of
his
kindness
of
heart
the
officer
made
up
his
mind
to
call
there
he
would
give
some
alms
to
the
poor
woman
for
his
dead
friend
s
sake
he
tied
his
horse
to
a
tree
and
opened
the
door
of
the
hut
without
knocking
mother
he
said
addressing
the
old
woman
who
was
sitting
by
the
fire
with
the
little
ones
crouching
at
her
side
do
you
remember
me
oh
quite
well
sir
you
came
here
one
fine
morning
last
spring
and
gave
us
two
there
mother
that
is
for
you
and
the
thank
you
kindly
sir
may
heaven
bless
you
you
must
not
thank
me
mother
said
the
officer
it
is
all
through
benassis
that
the
money
had
come
to
the
old
woman
raised
her
eyes
and
gazed
at
genestas
ah
sir
she
said
he
has
left
his
property
to
our
poor
countryside
and
made
all
of
us
his
heirs
but
we
have
lost
him
who
was
worth
more
than
all
for
it
was
he
who
made
everything
turn
out
well
for
mother
pray
for
him
said
genestas
making
a
few
playful
cuts
at
the
children
with
his
the
old
woman
and
her
little
charges
went
out
with
him
they
watched
him
mount
his
horse
and
ride
away
he
followed
the
road
along
the
valley
until
he
reached
the
that
led
to
la
fosseuse
s
cottage
from
the
slope
above
the
house
he
saw
that
the
door
was
fastened
and
the
shutters
closed
in
some
anxiety
he
returned
to
the
highway
and
rode
on
under
the
poplars
now
bare
and
leafless
before
long
he
overtook
the
old
laborer
who
was
dressed
in
his
sunday
best
and
creeping
slowly
along
the
road
there
was
no
bag
of
tools
on
his
shoulder
old
moreau
ah
sir
i
mind
who
you
are
now
the
old
fellow
exclaimed
after
a
moment
you
are
a
friend
of
monsieur
our
late
mayor
ah
sir
would
it
not
have
been
far
better
if
god
had
only
taken
a
poor
rheumatic
old
creature
like
me
instead
it
would
not
have
mattered
if
he
had
taken
me
but
he
was
the
light
of
our
do
you
know
how
it
is
that
there
is
no
one
at
home
up
there
at
la
fosseuse
s
cottage
the
old
man
gave
a
look
at
the
sky
what
time
is
it
sir
the
sun
has
not
shone
all
day
he
said
it
is
ten
o
oh
well
then
she
will
have
gone
to
mass
or
else
to
the
cemetery
she
goes
there
every
day
he
has
left
her
five
hundred
livres
a
year
and
her
house
for
as
long
as
she
lives
but
his
death
has
fairly
turned
her
brain
as
you
may
say
and
where
are
you
going
old
moreau
little
jacques
is
to
be
buried
and
i
am
going
to
the
funeral
he
was
my
nephew
poor
little
chap
he
had
been
ailing
for
a
long
while
and
he
died
yesterday
morning
it
really
looked
as
though
it
was
benassis
who
kept
him
alive
that
is
the
way
all
these
younger
ones
die
moreau
added
genestas
reined
in
his
horse
as
he
entered
the
town
for
he
met
gondrin
and
goguelat
each
carrying
a
pickaxe
and
shovel
he
called
to
them
well
old
comrades
we
have
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
him
there
there
that
is
enough
sir
interrupted
goguelat
we
know
that
well
enough
we
have
just
been
cutting
turf
to
cover
his
his
life
will
make
a
grand
story
to
tell
eh
yes
answered
goguelat
he
was
the
napoleon
of
our
valley
barring
the
as
they
reached
the
parsonage
genestas
saw
a
little
group
about
the
door
butifer
and
adrien
were
talking
with
janvier
who
no
doubt
had
just
returned
from
saying
mass
seeing
that
the
officer
made
as
though
he
were
about
to
dismount
butifer
promptly
went
to
hold
the
horse
while
adrien
sprang
forward
and
flung
his
arms
about
his
father
s
neck
genestas
was
deeply
touched
by
the
boy
s
affection
though
no
sign
of
this
appeared
in
the
soldier
s
words
or
manner
why
adrien
he
said
you
certainly
are
set
up
again
my
goodness
thanks
to
our
poor
friend
you
have
almost
grown
into
a
man
i
shall
not
forget
your
tutor
here
master
oh
colonel
entreated
butifer
take
me
away
from
here
and
put
me
into
your
regiment
i
can
not
trust
myself
now
that
le
maire
is
gone
wanted
me
to
go
for
a
soldier
didn
t
he
well
then
i
will
do
what
he
wished
he
told
you
all
about
me
and
you
will
not
be
hard
on
me
will
you
genestas
right
my
fine
fellow
said
genestas
as
he
struck
his
hand
in
the
other
s
i
will
find
something
to
suit
you
set
your
mind
at
rest
and
how
is
it
with
you
le
cure
well
like
every
one
else
in
the
canton
colonel
i
feel
sorrow
for
his
loss
but
no
one
knows
as
i
do
how
irreparable
it
is
he
was
like
an
angel
of
god
among
us
fortunately
he
did
not
suffer
at
all
it
was
a
painless
death
the
hand
of
god
gently
loosed
the
bonds
of
a
life
that
was
one
continual
blessing
to
us
will
it
be
intrusive
if
i
ask
you
to
accompany
me
to
the
cemetery
i
should
like
to
bid
him
farewell
as
it
genestas
and
the
cure
still
in
conversation
walked
on
together
butifer
and
adrien
followed
them
at
a
few
paces
distance
they
went
in
the
direction
of
the
little
lake
and
as
soon
as
they
were
clear
of
the
town
the
saw
on
the
a
large
piece
of
waste
land
enclosed
by
walls
that
is
the
cemetery
the
cure
told
him
he
is
the
first
to
be
buried
in
it
only
three
months
before
he
was
brought
here
it
struck
him
that
it
was
a
very
bad
arrangement
to
have
the
churchyard
round
the
church
so
in
order
to
carry
out
the
law
which
prescribes
that
burial
grounds
should
be
removed
a
stated
distance
from
human
dwellings
he
himself
gave
this
piece
of
land
to
the
commune
we
are
burying
a
child
poor
little
thing
in
the
new
cemetery
so
we
shall
have
begun
by
laying
innocence
and
virtue
there
can
it
be
that
death
is
after
all
a
reward
did
god
mean
it
as
a
lesson
for
us
when
he
took
these
two
perfect
natures
to
himself
when
we
have
been
tried
and
disciplined
in
youth
by
pain
in
later
life
by
mental
suffering
are
we
so
much
nearer
to
him
look
there
is
the
rustic
monument
which
has
been
erected
to
his
genestas
saw
a
mound
of
earth
about
twenty
feet
high
it
was
bare
as
yet
but
dwellers
in
the
district
were
already
busily
covering
the
sloping
sides
with
green
turf
la
fosseuse
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
was
sobbing
bitterly
she
was
sitting
on
the
pile
of
stones
in
which
they
had
planted
a
great
wooden
cross
made
from
the
trunk
of
a
from
which
the
bark
had
not
been
removed
the
officer
read
the
inscription
the
letters
were
large
and
had
been
deeply
cut
in
the
wood
here
lies
the
good
monsieur
benassis
the
father
of
us
all
pray
for
him
was
it
you
sir
asked
genestas
who
no
answered
the
cure
it
is
simply
what
is
said
everywhere
from
the
heights
up
there
above
us
down
to
grenoble
so
the
words
have
been
carved
genestas
remained
silent
for
a
few
moments
then
he
moved
from
where
he
stood
and
came
nearer
to
la
fosseuse
who
did
not
hear
him
and
spoke
again
to
the
cure
as
soon
as
i
have
my
pension
he
said
i
will
come
to
finish
my
days
here

addendum
