back
his

made

but
it

i
tell
you

it
a
brand
they
got
for
certain

that

not

million
years
at

coronation
ceremonies
we
march
between

casino
and
the
ninth
grand
custodian
of
the
royal

bedchamber
the
only
use
we
are
is
to
appear
in
photographs
and
accept
the
responsibility
for
the
apparent
that
ai
any
square
deal
yes
sir
webb
you
a
consort
and
if
i
was
you
i
start
a
interregnum
or
a
habeus

or
somethin
and
i
be
king
if
i
had
to
turn
from
the
bottom
of
the
deck
baldy
emptied
his
glass
to
the
ratification
of
his
warwick
pose
baldy
said
webb
solemnly
me
and
you
punched
cows
in
the
same
outfit
for
years
we
been
runnin
on
the
same
range
and
ridin
the
same
trails
since
we
was
boys
i
would
talk
about
my
family
affairs
to
nobody
but
you
you
was
on
the
nopalito
ranch
when
i
married
santa
mcallister
i
was
foreman
then
but
what
am
i
now
i
do
amount
to
a
knot
in
a
stake
rope
when
old
mcallister
was
the
cattle
king
of
west
texas
continued
baldy
with
satanic
sweetness
you
was
some
tallow
you
had
as
much
to
say
on
the
ranch
as
he
did
i
did
admitted
webb
up
to
the
time
he
found
out
i
was
tryin
to
get
my
rope
over
santa
head
then
he
kept
me
out
on
the
range
as
far
from
the
as
he
could
when
the
old
man
died
they
commenced
to
call
santa
the
queen
i
boss
of
the
cattle
that
all
she
to
all
the
business
she
handles
all
the
money
i
sell
even
a
to
a
party
of
campers
myself
santa
the
and
i
mr
nobody
i
be
king
if
i
was
you
repeated
baldy
woods
the
royalist
when
a
man
marries
a
queen
he
ought
to
grade
up
with
her
on
the
hoof
dressed
dried
corned
any
old
way
from
the
chaparral
to
the
house
lots
of
folks
thinks
it
funny
webb
that
you
do
have
the
on
the
nopalito
i
ai
reflectin
none
on
miz
yeager
the
finest
little
lady
between
the
rio
grande
and
next
christmas
but
a
man
ought
to
be
boss
of
his
own
camp
the
smooth
brown
face
of
yeager
lengthened
to
a
mask
of
wounded
melancholy
with
that
expression
and
his
rumpled
yellow
hair
and
guileless
blue
eyes
he
might
have
been
likened
to
a
schoolboy
whose
leadership
had
been
usurped
by
a
youngster
of
superior
strength
but
his
active
and
sinewy
inches
and
his
girded
revolvers
forbade
the
comparison
what
was
that
you
called
me
baldy
he
asked
what
kind
of
a
concert
was
it
a
corrected
baldy
a
it
a
kind
of
pseudonym
you
come
in
sort
of
between
and
a
flush
webb
yeager
sighed
and
gathered
the
strap
of
his
winchester
scabbard
from
the
floor
i
ridin
back
to
the
ranch
he
said
got
to
start
a
bunch
of
beeves
for
san
antone
in
the
morning
i
your
company
as
far
as
dry
lake
announced
baldy
i
got
a
camp
on
the
san
marcos
cuttin
out
the
two
mounted
their
ponies
and
trotted
away
from
the
little
railroad
settlement
where
they
had
foregathered
in
the
thirsty
morning
at
dry
lake
where
their
routes
diverged
they
reined
up
for
a
parting
cigarette
for
miles
they
had
ridden
in
silence
save
for
the
soft
drum
of
the
ponies
hoofs
on
the
matted
mesquite
grass
and
the
rattle
of
the
chaparral
against
their
wooden
stirrups
but
in
texas
discourse
is
seldom
continuous
you
may
fill
in
a
mile
a
meal
and
a
murder
between
your
paragraphs
without
detriment
to
your
thesis
so
without
apology
webb
offered
an
addendum
to
the
conversation
that
had
begun
ten
miles
away
you
remember
yourself
baldy
that
there
was
a
time
when
santa
was
quite
so
independent
you
remember
the
days
when
old
mcallister
was
keepin
us
apart
and
how
she
used
to
send
me
the
sign
that
she
wanted
to
see
me
old
man
mac
promised
to
make
me
look
like
a
colander
if
i
ever
come
in
of
the
ranch
you
remember
the
sign
she
used
to
send
baldy
the
heart
with
a
cross
inside
of
it
me
cried
baldy
with
intoxicated
archness
you
old
coyote
do
i
remember
why
you
old
dove
the
boys
in
camp
was
all
cognoscious
about
them
hiroglyphs
the
we
used
to
call
it
we
used
to
see
on
truck
that
was
sent
out
from
the
ranch
they
was
marked
in
charcoal
on
the
sacks
of
flour
and
in
on
the
newspapers
i
see
one
of
once
chalked
on
the
back
of
a
new
cook
that
old
man
mcallister
sent
out
from
the
ranch
danged
if
i
did
santa
father
explained
webb
gently
got
her
to
promise
that
she
would
write
to
me
or
send
me
any
word
that
sign
was
her
scheme
whenever
she
wanted
to
see
me
in
particular
she
managed
to
put
that
mark
on
somethin
at
the
ranch
that
she
knew
see
and
i
never
laid
eyes
on
it
but
what
i
burnt
the
wind
for
the
ranch
the
same
night
i
used
to
see
her
in
that
coma
mott
back
of
the
little
we
knowed
it
chanted
baldy
but
we
never
let
on
we
was
all
for
you
we
knowed
why
you
always
kept
that
fast
paint
in
camp
and
when
we
see
that
figured
out
on
the
truck
from
the
ranch
we
knowed
old
pinto
was
goin
to
eat
up
miles
that
night
instead
of
grass
you
remember
scurry
that
educated
we
had
the
college
fellow
that
drove
to
the
range
whenever
scurry
saw
that
brand
on
anything
from
the
ranch
he
wave
his
hand
like
that
and
say
friend
lee
andrews
will
again
swim
the
hell
point
the
last
time
santa
sent
me
the
sign
said
webb
was
once
when
she
was
sick
i
noticed
it
as
soon
as
i
hit
camp
and
i
galloped
pinto
forty
mile
that
night
she
was
at
the
coma
mott
i
went
to
the
house
and
old
mcallister
met
me
at
the
door
you
come
here
to
get
killed
says
he
disoblige
you
for
once
i
just
started
a
mexican
to
bring
you
santa
wants
you
go
in
that
room
and
see
her
and
then
come
out
here
and
see
me
santa
was
lyin
in
bed
pretty
sick
but
she
gives
out
a
kind
of
a
smile
and
her
hand
and
mine
lock
horns
and
i
sets
down
by
the
bed
mud
and
spurs
and
chaps
and
all
heard
you
ridin
across
the
grass
for
hours
webb
she
says
was
sure
you
come
you
saw
the
sign
she
whispers
minute
i
hit
camp
says
i
marked
on
the
bag
of
potatoes
and
onions
always
together
says
she
soft
like
together
in
life
go
well
together
i
says
a
stew
mean
hearts
and
crosses
says
santa
sign
to
love
and
to
suffer
that
what
they
mean
and
there
was
old
doc
musgrove
amusin
himself
with
whisky
and
a
fan
and
by
and
by
santa
goes
to
sleep
and
doc
feels
her
forehead
and
he
says
to
me
not
such
a
bad
febrifuge
but
you
better
slide
out
now
for
the
diagnosis
do
call
for
you
in
regular
doses
the
little
lady
be
all
right
when
she
wakes
up
i
seen
old
mcallister
outside
asleep
says
i
now
you
can
start
in
with
your
take
your
time
for
i
left
my
gun
on
my
old
mac
laughs
and
he
says
to
me
lead
into
the
best
boss
in
west
texas
do
seem
to
me
good
business
policy
i
do
know
where
i
could
get
as
good
a
one
it
the
idea
webb
that
makes
me
admire
for
to
use
you
as
a
target
you
ai
my
idea
for
a
member
of
the
family
but
i
can
use
you
on
the
nopalito
if
you
keep
outside
of
a
radius
with
the
in
the
middle
of
it
you
go
upstairs
and
lay
down
on
a
cot
and
when
you
get
some
sleep
we
talk
it
over
baldy
woods
pulled
down
his
hat
and
uncurled
his
leg
from
his
horn
webb
shortened
his
rein
and
his
pony
danced
anxious
to
be
off
the
two
men
shook
hands
with
western
ceremony
baldy
said
webb
i
glad
i
seen
you
and
had
this
talk
with
a
pounding
rush
that
sounded
like
the
rise
of
a
covey
of
quail
the
riders
sped
away
toward
different
points
of
the
compass
a
hundred
yards
on
his
route
baldy
reined
in
on
the
top
of
a
bare
knoll
and
emitted
a
yell
he
swayed
on
his
horse
had
he
been
on
foot
the
earth
would
have
risen
and
conquered
him
but
in
the
saddle
he
was
a
master
of
equilibrium
and
laughed
at
whisky
and
despised
the
centre
of
gravity
webb
turned
in
his
saddle
at
the
signal
if
i
was
you
came
baldy
strident
and
perverting
tones
i
be
king
at
eight
on
the
following
morning
bud
turner
rolled
from
his
saddle
in
front
of
the
nopalito
and
stumbled
with
whizzing
rowels
toward
the
gallery
bud
was
in
charge
of
the
bunch
of
that
was
to
strike
the
trail
that
morning
for
san
antonio
yeager
was
on
the
gallery
watering
a
cluster
of
hyacinths
growing
in
a
red
earthenware
jar
king
mcallister
had
bequeathed
to
his
daughter
many
of
his
strong
characteristics
his
resolution
his
gay
courage
his
contumacious
his
pride
as
a
reigning
monarch
of
hoofs
and
horns
and
had
been
mcallister
temp
and
tone
in
santa
they
survived
transposed
to
the
feminine
key
substantially
she
preserved
the
image
of
the
mother
who
had
been
summoned
to
wander
in
other
and
less
finite
green
pastures
long
before
the
waxing
herds
of
kine
had
conferred
royalty
upon
the
house
she
had
her
slim
strong
figure
and
grave
soft
prettiness
that
relieved
in
her
the
severity
of
the
imperious
mcallister
eye
and
the
mcallister
air
of
royal
independence
webb
stood
on
one
end
of
the
gallery
giving
orders
to
two
or
three
of
various
camps
and
outfits
who
had
ridden
in
for
instructions
morning
said
bud
briefly
where
do
you
want
them
beeves
to
go
in
town
to
barber
as
usual
now
to
answer
that
had
been
the
prerogative
of
the
queen
all
the
reins
of
business
buying
selling
and
banking
had
been
held
by
her
capable
fingers
the
handling
of
cattle
had
been
entrusted
fully
to
her
husband
in
the
days
of
king
mcallister
santa
had
been
his
secretary
and
helper
and
she
had
continued
her
work
with
wisdom
and
profit
but
before
she
could
reply
the
spake
up
with
calm
decision
you
drive
that
bunch
to
zimmerman
and
nesbit
pens
i
spoke
to
zimmerman
about
it
some
time
ago
bud
turned
on
his
high
wait
called
santa
quickly
she
looked
at
her
husband
with
surprise
in
her
steady
gray
eyes
why
what
do
you
mean
webb
she
asked
with
a
small
wrinkle
gathering
between
her
brows
i
never
deal
with
zimmerman
and
nesbit
barber
has
handled
every
head
of
stock
from
this
ranch
in
that
market
for
five
years
i
not
going
to
take
the
business
out
of
his
hands
she
faced
bud
turner
deliver
those
cattle
to
barber
she
concluded
positively
bud
gazed
impartially
at
the
hanging
on
the
gallery
stood
on
his
other
leg
and
chewed
a
i
want
this
bunch
of
beeves
to
go
to
zimmerman
and
nesbit
said
webb
with
a
frosty
light
in
his
blue
eyes
nonsense
said
santa
impatiently
you
better
start
on
bud
so
as
to
noon
at
the
little
elm
tell
barber
we
have
another
lot
of
culls
ready
in
about
a
month
bud
allowed
a
hesitating
eye
to
steal
upward
and
meet
webb
webb
saw
apology
in
his
look
and
fancied
he
saw
commiseration
you
deliver
them
cattle
he
said
grimly
to
barber
finished
santa
sharply
let
that
settle
it
is
there
anything
else
you
are
waiting
for
bud
no
m
said
bud
but
before
going
he
lingered
while
a
cow
tail
could
have
switched
thrice
for
man
is
man
ally
and
even
the
philistines
must
have
blushed
when
they
took
samson
in
the
way
they
did
you
hear
your
boss
cried
webb
sardonically
he
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
until
it
touched
the
floor
before
his
wife
webb
said
santa
rebukingly
you
acting
mighty
foolish
court
fool
your
majesty
said
webb
in
his
slow
tones
which
had
changed
their
quality
what
else
can
you
expect
let
me
tell
you
i
was
a
man
before
i
married
a
what
am
i
now
the
of
the
camps
i
be
a
man
again
santa
looked
at
him
closely
do
be
unreasonable
webb
she
said
calmly
you
have
been
slighted
in
any
way
do
i
ever
interfere
in
your
management
of
the
cattle
i
know
the
business
side
of
the
ranch
much
better
than
you
do
i
learned
it
from
dad
be
sensible
kingdoms
and
queendoms
said
webb
do
suit
me
unless
i
am
in
the
pictures
too
i
punch
the
cattle
and
you
wear
the
crown
all
right
i
rather
be
high
lord
chancellor
of
a
than
the
in
a
flush
it
your
ranch
and
barber
gets
the
beeves
webb
horse
was
tied
to
the
rack
he
walked
into
the
house
and
brought
out
his
roll
of
blankets
that
he
never
took
with
him
except
on
long
rides
and
his
slicker
and
his
longest
of
plaited
these
he
began
to
tie
deliberately
upon
his
saddle
santa
a
little
pale
followed
him
webb
swung
up
into
the
saddle
his
serious
smooth
face
was
without
expression
except
for
a
stubborn
light
that
smouldered
in
his
eyes
there
a
herd
of
cows
and
calves
said
he
near
the
hondo
hole
on
the
frio
that
ought
to
be

calves
i
forgot
to
leave
orders
you
better
tell
simms
to
attend
to
it
santa
laid
a
hand
on
the
horse
bridle
and
looked
her
husband
in
the
eye
are
you
going
to
leave
me
webb
she
asked
quietly
i
am
going
to
be
a
man
again
he
answered
i
wish
you
success
in
a
praiseworthy
attempt
she
said
with
a
sudden
coldness
she
turned
and
walked
directly
into
the
house
webb
yeager
rode
to
the
southeast
as
straight
as
the
topography
of
west
texas
permitted
and
when
he
reached
the
horizon
he
might
have
ridden
on
into
blue
space
as
far
as
knowledge
of
him
on
the
nopalito
went
and
the
days
with
sundays
at
their
head
formed
into
hebdomadal
squads
and
the
weeks
captained
by
the
full
moon
closed
ranks
into
menstrual
companies
crying
tempus
fugit
on
their
banners
and
the
months
marched
on
toward
the
vast
of
the
years
but
webb
yeager
came
no
more
to
the
dominions
of
his
queen
one
day
a
being
named
bartholomew
a
and
therefore
of
little
account
from
the
lower
rio
grande
country
rode
in
sight
of
the
nopalito
and
felt
hunger
assail
him
he
was
soon
seated
at
the
dining
table
of
that
hospitable
kingdom
talk
like
water
gushed
from
him
he
might
have
been
smitten
with
aaron
rod
that
is
your
gentle
shepherd
when
an
audience
is
vouchsafed
him
whose
ears
are
not
overgrown
with
wool
missis
yeager
he
babbled
i
see
a
man
the
other
day
on
the
rancho
seco
down
in
hidalgo
county
by
your
name
webb
yeager
was
his
just
been
engaged
as
manager
he
was
a
tall
man
not
saying
much
perhaps
he
was
some
kin
of
yours
do
you
think
a
husband
said
santa
cordially
the
seco
has
done
well
yeager
is
one
of
the
best
stockmen
in
the
west
the
dropping
out
of
a
rarely
disorganises
a
monarchy
queen
santa
had
appointed
as
of
the
ranch
a
trusty
subject
named
ramsay
who
had
been
one
of
her
father
faithful
vassals
and
there
was
scarcely
a
ripple
on
the
nopalito
ranch
save
when
the
created
undulations
in
the
grass
of
its
wide
acres
for
several
years
the
nopalito
had
been
making
experiments
with
an
english
breed
of
cattle
that
looked
down
with
aristocratic
contempt
upon
the
texas
the
experiments
were
found
satisfactory
and
a
pasture
had
been
set
aside
for
the
the
fame
of
them
had
gone
forth
into
the
chaparral
and
pear
as
far
as
men
ride
in
saddles
other
ranches
woke
up
rubbed
their
eyes
and
looked
with
new
dissatisfaction
upon
the
as
a
consequence
one
day
a
sunburned
capable
nonchalant
youth
garnished
with
revolvers
and
attended
by
three
mexican
alighted
at
the
nopalito
ranch
and
presented
the
following
epistle
to
the
queen
thereof
yeager
the
nopalito
ranch
dear
madam
i
am
instructed
by
the
owners
of
the
rancho
seco
to
purchase
head
of
two
and
cows
of
the
sussex
breed
owned
by
you
if
you
can
fill
the
order
please
deliver
the
cattle
to
the
bearer
and
a
check
will
be
forwarded
to
you
at
once
respectfully
webster
yeager
manager
the
rancho
seco
business
is
business
even
very
scantily
did
it
escape
being
written
especially
in
a
kingdom
that
night
the
head
of
cattle
were
driven
up
from
the
pasture
and
penned
in
a
corral
near
the
for
delivery
in
the
morning
when
night
closed
down
and
the
house
was
still
did
santa
yeager
throw
herself
down
clasping
that
formal
note
to
her
bosom
weeping
and
calling
out
a
name
that
pride
either
in
one
or
the
other
had
kept
from
her
lips
many
a
day
or
did
she
file
the
letter
in
her
business
way
retaining
her
royal
balance
and
strength
wonder
if
you
will
but
royalty
is
sacred
and
there
is
a
veil
but
this
much
you
shall
learn
at
midnight
santa
slipped
softly
out
of
the
clothed
in
something
dark
and
plain
she
paused
for
a
moment
under
the
trees
the
prairies
were
somewhat
dim
and
the
moonlight
was
pale
orange
diluted
with
particles
of
an
impalpable
flying
mist
but
the
whistled
on
every
bough
of
vantage
leagues
of
flowers
scented
the
air
and
a
kindergarten
of
little
shadowy
rabbits
leaped
and
played
in
an
open
space
near
by
santa
turned
her
face
to
the
southeast
and
threw
three
kisses
thitherward
for
there
was
none
to
see
then
she
sped
silently
to
the
fifty
yards
away
and
what
she
did
there
can
only
be
surmised
but
the
forge
glowed
red
and
there
was
a
faint
hammering
such
as
cupid
might
make
when
he
sharpens
his
later
she
came
forth
with
a
handled
thing
in
one
hand
and
a
portable
furnace
such
as
are
seen
in
in
the
other
to
the
corral
where
the
sussex
cattle
were
penned
she
sped
with
these
things
swiftly
in
the
moonlight
she
opened
the
gate
and
slipped
inside
the
corral
the
sussex
cattle
were
mostly
a
dark
red
but
among
this
bunch
was
one
that
was
milky
white
notable
among
the
others
and
now
santa
shook
from
her
shoulder
something
that
we
had
not
seen
before
a
rope
lasso
she
freed
the
loop
of
it
coiling
the
length
in
her
left
hand
and
plunged
into
the
thick
of
the
cattle
the
white
cow
was
her
object
she
swung
the
lasso
which
caught
one
horn
and
slipped
off
the
next
throw
encircled
the
forefeet
and
the
animal
fell
heavily
santa
made
for
it
like
a
panther
but
it
scrambled
up
and
dashed
against
her
knocking
her
over
like
a
blade
of
grass
again
she
made
her
cast
while
the
aroused
cattle
milled
around
the
four
sides
of
the
corral
in
a
plunging
mass
this
throw
was
fair
the
white
cow
came
to
earth
again
and
before
it
could
rise
santa
had
made
the
lasso
fast
around
a
post
of
the
corral
with
a
swift
and
simple
knot
and
had
leaped
upon
the
cow
again
with
the
rawhide
hobbles
in
one
minute
the
feet
of
the
animal
were
tied
no
deed
and
santa
leaned
against
the
corral
for
the
same
space
of
time
panting
and
lax
and
then
she
ran
swiftly
to
her
furnace
at
the
gate
and
brought
the
queerly
shaped
and
the
bellow
of
the
outraged
white
cow
as
the
iron
was
applied
should
have
stirred
the
slumbering
auricular
nerves
and
consciences
of
the
subjects
of
the
nopalito
but
it
did
not
and
it
was
amid
the
deepest
nocturnal
silence
that
santa
ran
like
a
lapwing
back
to
the
and
there
fell
upon
a
cot
and
sobbed
sobbed
as
though
queens
had
hearts
as
simple
ranchmen
wives
have
and
as
though
she
would
gladly
make
kings
of
should
they
ride
back
again
from
over
the
hills
and
far
away
in
the
morning
the
capable
revolvered
youth
and
his
set
forth
driving
the
bunch
of
sussex
cattle
across
the
prairies
to
the
rancho
seco
ninety
miles
it
was
a
six
days
journey
grazing
and
watering
the
animals
on
the
way
the
beasts
arrived
at
rancho
seco
one
evening
at
dusk
and
were
received
and
counted
by
the
foreman
of
the
ranch
the
next
morning
at
eight
a
horseman
loped
out
of
the
brush
to
the
nopalito
he
dismounted
stiffly
and
strode
with
whizzing
spurs
to
the
house
his
horse
gave
a
great
sigh
and
swayed
with
head
and
closed
eyes
but
waste
not
your
pity
upon
belshazzar
the
sorrel
in
nopalito
he
survives
pampered
beloved
unridden
cherished
of
rides
the
horseman
stumbled
into
the
house
two
arms
fell
around
his
neck
and
someone
cried
out
in
the
voice
of
woman
and
queen
alike
webb
oh
webb
i
was
a
skunk
said
webb
yeager
hush
said
santa
did
you
see
it
i
saw
it
said
webb
what
they
meant
god
knows
and
you
shall
know
if
you
rightly
read
the
primer
of
events
be
the
said
webb
and
overlook
it
if
you
can
i
was
a
mangy
coyote
hush
said
santa
again
laying
her
fingers
upon
his
mouth
no
queen
here
do
you
know
who
i
am
i
am
santa
yeager
first
lady
of
the
bedchamber
come
here
she
dragged
him
from
the
gallery
into
the
room
to
the
right
there
stood
a
cradle
with
an
infant
in
it
a
red
ribald
unintelligible
babbling
beautiful
infant
sputtering
at
life
in
an
unseemly
manner
there
no
queen
on
this
ranch
said
santa
again
look
at
the
king
he
got
your
eyes
webb
down
on
your
knees
and
look
at
his
highness
but
jingling
rowels
sounded
on
the
gallery
and
bud
turner
stumbled
there
again
with
the
same
query
that
he
had
brought
lacking
a
few
days
a
year
ago
them
beeves
is
just
turned
out
on
the
trail
shall
i
drive
to
barber
or
he
saw
webb
and
stopped
shrieked
the
king
in
his
cradle
beating
the
air
with
his
fists
you
hear
your
boss
bud
said
webb
yeager
with
a
broad
grin
just
as
he
had
said
a
year
ago
and
that
is
all
except
that
when
old
man
quinn
owner
of
the
rancho
seco
went
out
to
look
over
the
herd
of
sussex
cattle
that
he
had
bought
from
the
nopalito
ranch
he
asked
his
new
manager
what
the
nopalito
ranch
brand
wilson
x
bar
y
said
wilson
i
thought
so
said
quinn
but
look
at
that
white
heifer
there
she
got
another
brand
a
heart
with
a
cross
inside
of
it
what
brand
is
that
ii
the
ransom
of
mack
me
and
old
mack
lonsbury
we
got
out
of
that
little
gold
mine
affair
with
about
apiece
i
say
old
mack
but
he
old
i
should
say
but
he
always
seemed
old
andy
he
says
to
me
i
tired
of
hustling
you
and
me
have
been
working
hard
together
for
three
years
say
we
knock
off
for
a
while
and
spend
some
of
this
idle
money
we
coaxed
our
way
the
proposition
hits
me
just
right
says
i
let
be
nabobs
for
a
while
and
see
how
it
feels
what
we
do
take
in
the
niagara
falls
or
buck
at
faro
for
a
good
many
years
says
mack
i
thought
that
if
i
ever
had
extravagant
money
i
rent
a
cabin
somewhere
hire
a
chinaman
to
cook
and
sit
in
my
stocking
feet
and
read
buckle
history
of
civilisation
that
sounds
and
gratifying
without
vulgar
ostentation
says
i
and
i
do
see
how
money
could
be
better
invested
give
me
a
cuckoo
clock
and
a
sep
winner
for
the
banjo
and
i
join
you
a
week
afterwards
me
and
mack
hits
this
small
town
of
pina
about
thirty
miles
out
from
denver
and
finds
an
elegant
house
that
just
suits
us
we
deposited
of
money
in
the
pina
bank
and
shook
hands
with
every
one
of
the
citizens
in
the
town
we
brought
along
the
chinaman
and
the
cuckoo
clock
and
buckle
and
the
instructor
with
us
from
denver
and
they
made
the
cabin
seem
like
home
at
once
never
believe
it
when
they
tell
you
riches
do
bring
happiness
if
you
could
have
seen
old
mack
sitting
in
his
with
his
sock
feet
up
in
the
window
and
absorbing
in
that
buckle
stuff
through
his
specs
you
have
seen
a
picture
of
content
that
would
have
made
rockefeller
jealous
and
i
was
learning
to
pick
out
old
zip
coon
on
the
banjo
and
the
cuckoo
was
on
time
with
his
remarks
and
ah
sing
was
messing
up
the
atmosphere
with
the
handsomest
smell
of
ham
and
eggs
that
ever
laid
the
honeysuckle
in
the
shade
when
it
got
too
dark
to
make
out
buckle
nonsense
and
the
notes
in
the
instructor
me
and
mack
would
light
our
pipes
and
talk
about
science
and
pearl
diving
and
sciatica
and
egypt
and
spelling
and
fish
and
and
leather
and
gratitude
and
eagles
and
a
lot
of
subjects
that
we
never
had
time
to
explain
our
sentiments
about
before
one
evening
mack
spoke
up
and
asked
me
if
i
was
much
apprised
in
the
habits
and
policies
of
women
folks
why
yes
says
i
in
a
tone
of
voice
i
know
from
alfred
to
omaha
the
feminine
nature
and
similitude
says
i
is
as
plain
to
my
sight
as
the
rocky
mountains
is
to
a
burro
i
onto
all
their
little
and
punctual
discrepancies
i
tell
you
andy
says
mack
with
a
kind
of
sigh
i
never
had
the
least
amount
of
intersection
with
their
predispositions
maybe
i
might
have
had
a
proneness
in
respect
to
their
vicinity
but
i
never
took
the
time
i
made
my
own
living
since
i
was
fourteen
and
i
never
seemed
to
get
my
ratiocinations
equipped
with
the
sentiments
usually
depicted
toward
the
sect
i
sometimes
wish
i
had
says
old
mack
they
an
adverse
study
says
i
and
adapted
to
points
of
view
although
they
vary
in
rationale
i
have
found
quite
often
obviously
differing
from
each
other
in
divergences
of
contrast
it
seems
to
me
goes
on
mack
that
a
man
had
better
take
in
and
secure
his
inspirations
of
the
sect
when
he
young
and
so
preordained
i
let
my
chance
go
by
and
i
guess
i
too
old
now
to
go
hopping
into
the
curriculum
oh
i
do
know
i
tells
him
maybe
you
better
credit
yourself
with
a
barrel
of
money
and
a
lot
of
emancipation
from
a
quantity
of
uncontent
still
i
do
regret
my
knowledge
of
i
says
it
takes
a
man
who
understands
the
symptoms
and
of
to
take
care
of
himself
in
this
world
we
stayed
on
in
pina
because
we
liked
the
place
some
folks
might
enjoy
their
money
with
noise
and
rapture
and
locomotion
but
me
and
mack
we
had
had
plenty
of
turmoils
and
hotel
towels
the
people
were
friendly
ah
sing
got
the
swing
of
the
grub
we
liked
mack
and
buckle
were
as
thick
as
two
and
i
was
hitting
out
a
cordial
resemblance
to
buffalo
gals
ca
you
come
out
on
the
banjo
one
day
i
got
a
telegram
from
speight
the
man
that
was
working
on
a
mine
i
had
an
interest
in
out
in
new
mexico
i
had
to
go
out
there
and
i
was
gone
two
months
i
was
anxious
to
get
back
to
pina
and
enjoy
life
once
more
when
i
struck
the
cabin
i
nearly
fainted
mack
was
standing
in
the
door
and
if
angels
ever
wept
i
saw
no
reason
why
they
should
be
smiling
then
that
man
was
a
spectacle
yes
he
was
worse
he
was
a
spyglass
he
was
the
great
telescope
in
the
lick
observatory
he
had
on
a
coat
and
shiny
shoes
and
a
white
vest
and
a
high
silk
hat
and
a
geranium
as
big
as
an
order
of
spinach
was
spiked
onto
his
front
and
he
was
smirking
and
warping
his
face
like
an
infernal
storekeeper
or
a
kid
with
colic
hello
andy
says
mack
out
of
his
face
glad
to
see
you
back
things
have
happened
since
you
went
away
i
know
it
says
i
and
a
sacrilegious
sight
it
is
god
never
made
you
that
way
mack
lonsbury
why
do
you
scarify
his
works
with
this
presumptuous
kind
of
ribaldry
why
andy
says
he
they
elected
me
justice
of
the
peace
since
you
left
i
looked
at
mack
close
he
was
restless
and
inspired
a
justice
of
the
peace
ought
to
be
disconsolate
and
assuaged
just
then
a
young
woman
passed
on
the
sidewalk
and
i
saw
mack
kind
of
half
snicker
and
blush
and
then
he
raised
up
his
hat
and
smiled
and
bowed
and
she
smiled
and
bowed
and
went
on
by
no
hope
for
you
says
i
if
you
got
the
infirmity
at
your
age
i
thought
it
was
going
to
take
on
you
and
patent
leather
shoes
all
this
in
two
little
short
months
i
going
to
marry
the
young
lady
who
just
passed
says
mack
in
a
kind
of
flutter
i
forgot
something
at
the
says
i
and
walked
away
quick
i
overtook
that
young
woman
a
hundred
yards
away
i
raised
my
hat
and
told
her
my
name
she
was
about
nineteen
and
young
for
her
age
she
blushed
and
then
looked
at
me
cool
like
i
was
the
snow
scene
from
the
two
orphans

to
have
owed
money
to
your
father
and
that
old
specious
garbled
ptomaine
prancing
about
avidiously
like
an
irremediable
turkey
gobbler
with
patent
leather
shoes
on
is
my
best
friend
why
did
you
go
and
get
him
invested
in
this
marriage
business
why
he
was
the
only
chance
there
was
answers
miss
rebosa
nay
says
i
giving
a
sickening
look
of
admiration
at
her
complexion
and
style
of
features
with
your
beauty
you
might
pick
any
kind
of
a
man
listen
rebosa
old
mack
ai
the
man
you
want
he
was
two
when
you
was
reed
as
the
papers
say
this
bursting
into
bloom
wo
last
with
him
he
all
ventilated
with
oldness
and
rectitude
and
decay
old
mack
down
with
a
case
of
indian
summer
he
overlooked
his
bet
when
he
was
young
and
now
he
suing
nature
for
the
interest
on
the
promissory
note
he
took
from
cupid
instead
of
the
cash
rebosa
are
you
bent
on
having
this
marriage
occur
why
sure
i
am
says
she
oscillating
the
pansies
on
her
hat
and
so
is
somebody
else
i
reckon
what
time
is
it
to
take
place
i
asks
at
six
says
she
i
made
up
my
mind
right
away
what
to
do
i
save
old
mack
if
i
could
to
have
a
good
seasoned
ineligible
man
like
that
turn
chicken
for
a
girl
that
had
quit
eating
slate
pencils
and
buttoning
in
the
back
was
more
than
i
could
look
on
with
easiness
rebosa
says
i
earnest
drawing
upon
my
display
of
knowledge
concerning
the
feminine
intuitions
of
reason
ai
there
a
young
man
in
pina
a
nice
young
man
that
you
think
a
heap
of
yep
says
rebosa
nodding
her
pansies
sure
there
is
what
do
you
think
gracious
does
he
like
you
i
asks
how
does
he
stand
in
the
matter
crazy
says
rebosa
ma
has
to
wet
down
the
front
steps
to
keep
him
from
sitting
there
all
the
time
but
i
guess
that
be
all
over
after
she
winds
up
with
a
sigh
rebosa
says
i
you
do
really
experience
any
of
this
adoration
called
love
for
old
mack
do
you
lord
no
says
the
girl
shaking
her
head
i
think
he
as
dry
as
a
lava
bed
the
idea
who
is
this
young
man
that
you
like
rebosa
i
inquires
it
eddie
bayles
says
she
he
clerks
in
crosby
grocery
but
he
do
make
but
a
month
ella
noakes
was
wild
about
him
once
old
mack
tells
me
i
says
that
he
going
to
marry
you
at
six
this
evening
that
the
time
says
she
it
to
be
at
our
house
rebosa
says
i
listen
to
me
if
eddie
bayles
had
a
thousand
dollars
cash
a
thousand
dollars
mind
you
would
buy
him
a
store
of
his
own
if
you
and
eddie
had
that
much
to
excuse
matrimony
on
would
you
consent
to
marry
him
this
evening
at
five
the
girl
looks
at
me
a
minute
and
i
can
see
these
inaudible
cogitations
going
on
inside
of
her
as
women
will
a
thousand
dollars
says
she
of
course
i
would
come
on
says
i
we
go
and
see
eddie
we
went
up
to
crosby
store
and
called
eddie
outside
he
looked
to
be
estimable
and
freckled
and
he
had
chills
and
fever
when
i
made
my
proposition
at
five
says
he
for
a
thousand
dollars
please
do
wake
me
up
well
you
the
rich
uncle
retired
from
the
spice
business
in
india
i
buy
out
old
crosby
and
run
the
store
myself
we
went
inside
and
got
old
man
crosby
apart
and
explained
it
i
wrote
my
check
for
a
thousand
dollars
and
handed
it
to
him
if
eddie
and
rebosa
married
each
other
at
five
he
was
to
turn
the
money
over
to
them
and
then
i
gave
my
blessing
and
went
to
wander
in
the
wildwood
for
a
season
i
sat
on
a
log
and
made
cogitations
on
life
and
old
age
and
the
zodiac
and
the
ways
of
women
and
all
the
disorder
that
goes
with
a
lifetime
i
passed
myself
congratulations
that
i
had
probably
saved
my
old
friend
mack
from
his
attack
of
indian
summer
i
knew
when
he
got
well
of
it
and
shed
his
infatuation
and
his
patent
leather
shoes
he
would
feel
grateful
to
keep
old
mack
disinvolved
thinks
i
from
relapses
like
this
is
worth
more
than
a
thousand
dollars
and
most
of
all
i
was
glad
that
i
made
a
study
of
women
and
to
be
deceived
any
by
their
means
of
conceit
and
evolution
it
must
have
been
five
when
i
got
back
home
i
stepped
in
and
there
sat
old
mack
on
the
back
of
his
neck
in
his
old
clothes
with
his
blue
socks
on
the
window
and
the
history
of
civilisation
propped
up
on
his
knees
this
do
look
like
getting
ready
for
a
wedding
at
six
i
says
to
seem
innocent
oh
says
mack
reaching
for
his
tobacco
that
was
postponed
back
to
five
they
sent
me
over
a
note
saying
the
hour
had
been
changed
it
all
over
now
what
made
you
stay
away
so
long
andy
you
heard
about
the
wedding
i
asks
i
operated
it
says
he
i
told
you
i
was
justice
of
the
peace
the
preacher
is
off
east
to
visit
his
folks
and
i
the
only
one
in
town
that
can
perform
the
dispensations
of
marriage
i
promised
eddie
and
rebosa
a
month
ago
i
marry
he
a
busy
lad
and
he
have
a
grocery
of
his
own
some
day
he
will
says
i
there
was
lots
of
women
at
the
wedding
says
mack
smoking
up
but
i
did
seem
to
get
any
ideas
from
i
wish
i
was
informed
in
the
structure
of
their
attainments
like
you
said
you
was
that
was
two
months
ago
says
i
reaching
up
for
the
banjo
iii
telemachus
friend
returning
from
a
hunting
trip
i
waited
at
the
little
town
of
los
pinos
in
new
mexico
for
the
train
which
was
one
hour
late
i
sat
on
the
porch
of
the
summit
house
and
discussed
the
functions
of
life
with
telemachus
hicks
the
hotel
proprietor
perceiving
that
personalities
were
not
out
of
order
i
asked
him
what
species
of
beast
had
long
ago
twisted
and
mutilated
his
left
ear
being
a
hunter
i
was
concerned
in
the
evils
that
may
befall
one
in
the
pursuit
of
game
that
ear
says
hicks
is
the
relic
of
true
friendship
an
accident
i
persisted
no
friendship
is
an
accident
said
telemachus
and
i
was
silent
the
only
perfect
case
of
true
friendship
i
ever
knew
went
on
my
host
was
a
cordial
intent
between
a
connecticut
man
and
a
monkey
the
monkey
climbed
palms
in
barranquilla
and
threw
down
cocoanuts
to
the
man
the
man
sawed
them
in
two
and
made
dippers
which
he
sold
for
two
each
and
bought
rum
the
monkey
drank
the
milk
of
the
nuts
through
each
being
satisfied
with
his
own
share
of
the
graft
they
lived
like
brothers
but
in
the
case
of
human
beings
friendship
is
a
transitory
art
subject
to
discontinuance
without
further
notice
i
had
a
friend
once
of
the
entitlement
of
paisley
fish
that
i
imagined
was
sealed
to
me
for
an
endless
space
of
time
side
by
side
for
seven
years
we
had
mined
ranched
sold
patent
churns
herded
sheep
took
photographs
and
other
things
built
wire
fences
and
picked
prunes
thinks
i
neither
homocide
nor
flattery
nor
riches
nor
sophistry
nor
drink
can
make
trouble
between
me
and
paisley
fish
we
was
friends
an
amount
you
could
hardly
guess
at
we
was
friends
in
business
and
we
let
our
amicable
qualities
lap
over
and
season
our
hours
of
recreation
and
folly
we
certainly
had
days
of
damon
and
nights
of
pythias
one
summer
me
and
paisley
gallops
down
into
these
san
andres
mountains
for
the
purpose
of
a
month
surcease
and
levity
dressed
in
the
natural
store
habiliments
of
man
we
hit
this
town
of
los
pinos
which
certainly
was
a
spot
of
the
world
and
flowing
with
condensed
milk
and
honey
it
had
a
street
or
two
and
air
and
hens
and
a
and
that
was
enough
for
us
we
strikes
the
town
after
and
we
concludes
to
sample
whatever
efficacy
there
is
in
this
down
by
the
railroad
tracks
by
the
time
we
had
set
down
and
pried
up
our
plates
with
a
knife
from
the
red
along
intrudes
widow
jessup
with
the
hot
biscuit
and
the
fried
liver
now
there
was
a
woman
that
would
have
tempted
an
anchovy
to
forget
his
vows
she
was
not
so
small
as
she
was
large
and
a
kind
of
welcome
air
seemed
to
mitigate
her
vicinity
the
pink
of
her
face
was
the
hoc
of
a
culinary
temper
and
a
warm
disposition
and
her
smile
would
have
brought
out
the
dogwood
blossoms
in
december
widow
jessup
talks
to
us
a
lot
of
garrulousness
about
the
climate
and
history
and
tennyson
and
prunes
and
the
scarcity
of
mutton
and
finally
wants
to
know
where
we
came
from
valley
says
i
spring
valley
chips
in
paisley
out
of
a
lot
of
potatoes
and
of
ham
in
his
mouth
that
was
the
first
sign
i
noticed
that
the
old
business
between
me
and
paisley
fish
was
ended
forever
he
knew
how
i
hated
a
talkative
person
and
yet
he
stampedes
into
the
conversation
with
his
amendments
and
addendums
of
syntax
on
the
map
it
was
big
spring
valley
but
i
had
heard
paisley
himself
call
it
spring
valley
a
thousand
times
without
saying
any
more
we
went
out
after
supper
and
set
on
the
railroad
track
we
had
been
pardners
too
long
not
to
know
what
was
going
on
in
each
other
mind
reckon
you
understand
says
paisley
i
made
up
my
mind
to
accrue
that
widow
woman
as
part
and
parcel
in
and
to
my
hereditaments
forever
both
domestic
sociable
legal
and
otherwise
until
death
us
do
part
yes
says
i
read
it
between
the
lines
though
you
only
spoke
one
and
i
suppose
you
are
aware
says
i
i
have
a
movement
on
foot
that
leads
up
to
the
widow
changing
her
name
to
hicks
and
leaves
you
writing
to
the
society
column
to
inquire
whether
the
best
man
wears
a
japonica
or
seamless
socks
at
the
wedding
be
some
hiatuses
in
your
program
says
paisley
chewing
up
a
piece
of
a
railroad
tie
give
in
to
you
says
he
any
respect
if
it
was
secular
affairs
but
this
is
not
so
the
smiles
of
woman
goes
on
paisley
the
whirlpool
of
squills
and
chalybeates
into
which
vortex
the
good
ship
friendship
is
often
drawn
and
dismembered
i
assault
a
bear
that
was
annoying
you
says
paisley
i
endorse
your
note
or
rub
the
place
between
your
with
opodeldoc
the
same
as
ever
but
there
my
sense
of
etiquette
ceases
in
this
fracas
with
jessup
we
play
it
alone
i
notified
you
fair
and
then
i
collaborates
with
myself
and
offers
the
following
resolutions
and
between
man
and
man
says
i
an
ancient
historical
virtue
enacted
in
the
days
when
men
had
to
protect
each
other
against
lizards
with
tails
and
flying
turtles
and
they
kept
up
the
habit
to
this
day
and
stand
by
each
other
till
the
bellboy
comes
up
and
tells
them
the
animals
are
not
really
there
i
often
heard
i
says
ladies
stepping
in
and
breaking
up
a
friendship
between
men
why
should
that
be
i
tell
you
paisley
the
first
sight
and
hot
biscuit
of
jessup
appears
to
have
inserted
a
oscillation
into
each
of
our
bosoms
let
the
best
man
of
us
have
her
i
play
you
a
square
game
and
wo
do
any
underhanded
work
i
do
all
of
my
courting
of
her
in
your
presence
so
you
will
have
an
equal
opportunity
with
that
arrangement
i
do
see
why
our
steamboat
of
friendship
should
fall
overboard
in
the
medicinal
whirlpools
you
speak
of
whichever
of
us
wins
out
old
hoss
says
paisley
shaking
my
hand
i
do
the
same
says
he
court
the
lady
synonymously
and
without
any
of
the
prudery
and
bloodshed
usual
to
such
occasions
and
we
be
friends
still
win
or
lose
at
one
side
of
jessup
was
a
bench
under
some
trees
where
she
used
to
sit
in
the
breeze
after
the
had
been
fed
and
gone
and
there
me
and
paisley
used
to
congregate
after
supper
and
make
partial
payments
on
our
respects
to
the
lady
of
our
choice
and
we
was
so
honorable
and
circuitous
in
our
calls
that
if
one
of
us
got
there
first
we
waited
for
the
other
before
beginning
any
gallivantery
the
first
evening
that
jessup
knew
about
our
arrangement
i
got
to
the
bench
before
paisley
did
supper
was
just
over
and
jessup
was
out
there
with
a
fresh
pink
dress
on
and
almost
cool
enough
to
handle
i
sat
down
by
her
and
made
a
few
specifications
about
the
moral
surface
of
nature
as
set
forth
by
the
landscape
and
the
contiguous
perspective
that
evening
was
surely
a
case
in
point
the
moon
was
attending
to
business
in
the
section
of
sky
where
it
belonged
and
the
trees
was
making
shadows
on
the
ground
according
to
science
and
nature
and
there
was
a
kind
of
conspicuous
hullabaloo
going
on
in
the
bushes
between
the
bullbats
and
the
orioles
and
the
and
other
feathered
insects
of
the
forest
and
the
wind
out
of
the
mountains
was
singing
like
a
in
the
pile
of
old
by
the
railroad
track
i
felt
a
kind
of
sensation
in
my
left
side
something
like
dough
rising
in
a
crock
by
the
fire
jessup
had
moved
up
closer
hicks
says
she
one
is
alone
in
the
world
they
feel
it
more
aggravated
on
a
beautiful
night
like
this
i
rose
up
off
the
bench
at
once
me
says
i
i
have
to
wait
till
paisley
comes
before
i
can
give
a
audible
hearing
to
leading
questions
like
that
and
then
i
explained
to
her
how
we
was
friends
cinctured
by
years
of
embarrassment
and
travel
and
complicity
and
how
we
had
agreed
to
take
no
advantage
of
each
other
in
any
of
the
more
mushy
walks
of
life
such
as
might
be
fomented
by
sentiment
and
proximity
jessup
appears
to
think
serious
about
the
matter
for
a
minute
and
then
she
breaks
into
a
species
of
laughter
that
makes
the
wildwood
resound
in
a
few
minutes
paisley
drops
around
with
oil
of
bergamot
on
his
hair
and
sits
on
the
other
side
of
jessup
and
inaugurates
a
sad
tale
of
adventure
in
which
him
and
pieface
lumley
has
a
of
dead
cows
in
for
a
saddle
in
the
santa
rita
valley
during
the
nine
months
drought
now
from
the
start
of
that
courtship
i
had
paisley
fish
hobbled
and
tied
to
a
post
each
one
of
us
had
a
different
system
of
reaching
out
for
the
easy
places
in
the
female
heart
paisley
scheme
was
to
petrify
with
wonderful
relations
of
events
that
he
had
either
come
across
personally
or
in
large
print
i
think
he
must
have
got
his
idea
of
subjugation
from
one
of
shakespeare
shows
i
see
once
called
there
is
a
coloured
man
in
it
who
acquires
a
daughter
by
disbursing
to
her
a
mixture
of
the
talk
turned
out
by
rider
haggard
lew
dockstader
and
parkhurst
but
that
style
of
courting
do
work
well
off
the
stage
now
i
give
you
my
own
recipe
for
inveigling
a
woman
into
that
state
of
affairs
when
she
can
be
referred
to
as
jones
learn
how
to
pick
up
her
hand
and
hold
it
and
she
yours
it
ai
so
easy
some
men
grab
at
it
so
much
like
they
was
going
to
set
a
dislocation
of
the
shoulder
that
you
can
smell
the
arnica
and
hear
tearing
off
bandages
some
take
it
up
like
a
hot
horseshoe
and
hold
it
off
at
arm
length
like
a
druggist
pouring
tincture
of
asafoetida
in
a
bottle
and
most
of
catch
hold
of
it
and
drag
it
right
out
before
the
lady
eyes
like
a
boy
finding
a
baseball
in
the
grass
without
giving
her
a
chance
to
forget
that
the
hand
is
growing
on
the
end
of
her
arm
them
ways
are
all
wrong
i
tell
you
the
right
way
did
you
ever
see
a
man
sneak
out
in
the
back
yard
and
pick
up
a
rock
to
throw
at
a
tomcat
that
was
sitting
on
a
fence
looking
at
him
he
pretends
he
has
got
a
thing
in
his
hand
and
that
the
cat
do
see
him
and
that
he
do
see
the
cat
the
idea
never
drag
her
hand
out
where
she
have
to
take
notice
of
it
do
let
her
know
that
you
think
she
knows
you
have
the
least
idea
she
is
aware
you
are
holding
her
hand
that
was
my
rule
of
tactics
and
as
far
as
paisley
serenade
about
hostilities
and
misadventure
went
he
might
as
well
have
been
reading
to
her
a
table
of
the
sunday
trains
that
stop
at
ocean
grove
new
jersey
one
night
when
i
beat
paisley
to
the
bench
by
one
pipeful
my
friendship
gets
subsidised
for
a
minute
and
i
asks
jessup
if
she
did
think
a
was
easier
to
write
than
a
in
a
second
her
head
was
mashing
the
oleander
flower
in
my
and
i
leaned
over
and
but
i
did
you
do
mind
says
i
standing
up
wait
for
paisley
to
come
before
finishing
this
i
never
done
anything
dishonourable
yet
to
our
friendship
and
this
wo
be
quite
fair
hicks
says
jessup
looking
at
me
peculiar
in
the
dark
it
was
for
but
one
thing
i
ask
you
to
hike
yourself
down
the
gulch
and
never
disresume
your
visits
to
my
house
what
is
that
i
asks
are
too
good
a
friend
not
to
make
a
good
husband
says
she
in
five
minutes
paisley
was
on
his
side
of
jessup
silver
city
in
the
summer
of
he
begins
see
jim
batholomew
chew
off
a
chinaman
ear
in
the
blue
light
saloon
on
account
of
a
crossbarred
muslin
shirt
that
what
was
that
noise
i
had
resumed
matters
again
with
jessup
right
where
we
had
left
off
jessup
says
i
promised
to
make
it
hicks
and
this
is
another
of
the
same
sort
paisley
winds
his
feet
round
a
leg
of
the
bench
and
kind
of
groans
says
he
been
friends
for
seven
years
would
you
mind
not
kissing
jessup
quite
so
loud
i
do
the
same
for
you
right
says
i
other
kind
will
do
as
well
chinaman
goes
on
paisley
the
one
that
shot
a
man
named
mullins
in
the
spring
of
and
that
was
paisley
interrupted
himself
again
says
he
you
was
a
true
friend
you
would
hug
jessup
quite
so
hard
i
felt
the
bench
shake
all
over
just
then
you
know
you
told
me
you
would
give
me
an
even
chance
as
long
as
there
was
any
man
says
jessup
turning
around
to
paisley
you
was
to
drop
in
to
the
celebration
of
mine
and
hicks
silver
wedding
years
from
now
do
you
think
you
could
get
it
into
that
hubbard
squash
you
call
your
head
that
you
are
cum
in
this
business
i
put
up
with
you
a
long
time
because
you
was
friend
but
it
seems
to
me
it
time
for
you
to
wear
the
willow
and
trot
off
down
the
hill
jessup
says
i
without
losing
my
grasp
on
the
situation
as
fiance
paisley
is
my
friend
and
i
offered
him
a
square
deal
and
a
equal
opportunity
as
long
as
there
was
a
chance
chance
says
she
he
may
think
he
has
a
chance
but
i
hope
he
wo
think
he
got
a
cinch
after
what
he
been
next
to
all
the
evening
well
a
month
afterwards
me
and
jessup
was
married
in
the
los
pinos
methodist
church
and
the
whole
town
closed
up
to
see
the
performance
when
we
lined
up
in
front
and
the
preacher
was
beginning
to
sing
out
his
rituals
and
observances
i
looks
around
and
misses
paisley
i
calls
time
on
the
preacher
ai
here
says
i
got
to
wait
for
paisley
a
friend
once
a
friend
always
that
telemachus
hicks
says
jessup
eyes
snapped
some
but
the
preacher
holds
up
the
incantations
according
to
instructions
in
a
few
minutes
paisley
gallops
up
the
aisle
putting
on
a
cuff
as
he
comes
he
explains
that
the
only
store
in
town
was
closed
for
the
wedding
and
he
could
get
the
kind
of
a
boiled
shirt
that
his
taste
called
for
until
he
had
broke
open
the
back
window
of
the
store
and
helped
himself
then
he
ranges
up
on
the
other
side
of
the
bride
and
the
wedding
goes
on
i
always
imagined
that
paisley
calculated
as
a
last
chance
that
the
preacher
might
marry
him
to
the
widow
by
mistake
after
the
proceedings
was
over
we
had
tea
and
jerked
antelope
and
canned
apricots
and
then
the
populace
hiked
itself
away
last
of
all
paisley
shook
me
by
the
hand
and
told
me
i
acted
square
and
on
the
level
with
him
and
he
was
proud
to
call
me
a
friend
the
preacher
had
a
small
house
on
the
side
of
the
street
that
fixed
up
to
rent
and
he
allowed
me
and
hicks
to
occupy
it
till
the
train
the
next
morning
when
we
was
going
on
a
bridal
tour
to
el
paso
his
wife
had
decorated
it
all
up
with
hollyhocks
and
poison
ivy
and
it
looked
real
festal
and
bowery
about
ten
that
night
i
sets
down
in
the
front
door
and
pulls
off
my
boots
a
while
in
the
cool
breeze
while
hicks
was
fixing
around
in
the
room
right
soon
the
light
went
out
inside
and
i
sat
there
a
while
reverberating
over
old
times
and
scenes
and
then
i
heard
hicks
call
out
you
coming
in
soon
lem
well
says
i
kind
of
rousing
up
me
if
i
waiting
for
old
paisley
to
but
when
i
got
that
far
concluded
telemachus
hicks
i
thought
somebody
had
shot
this
left
ear
of
mine
off
with
a
but
it
turned
out
to
be
only
a
lick
from
a
broomhandle
in
the
hands
of
mrs
hicks
iv
the
handbook
of
hymen
the
opinion
of
myself
sanderson
pratt
who
sets
this
down
that
the
educational
system
of
the
united
states
should
be
in
the
hands
of
the
weather
bureau
i
can
give
you
good
reasons
for
it
and
you
tell
me
why
our
college
professors
should
be
transferred
to
the
meteorological
department
they
have
been
learned
to
read
and
they
could
very
easily
glance
at
the
morning
papers
and
then
wire
in
to
the
main
office
what
kind
of
weather
to
expect
but
there
the
other
side
of
the
proposition
i
am
going
on
to
tell
you
how
the
weather
furnished
me
and
idaho
green
with
an
elegant
education
we
was
up
in
the
bitter
root
mountains
over
the
montana
line
prospecting
for
gold
a
man
in
carrying
a
line
of
hope
as
excess
baggage
had
grubstaked
us
and
there
we
was
in
the
foothills
pecking
away
with
enough
grub
on
hand
to
last
an
army
through
a
peace
conference
along
one
day
comes
a
over
the
mountains
from
carlos
and
stops
to
eat
three
cans
of
greengages
and
leave
us
a
newspaper
of
modern
date
this
paper
prints
a
system
of
premonitions
of
the
weather
and
the
card
it
dealt
bitter
root
mountains
from
the
bottom
of
the
deck
was
warmer
and
fair
with
light
westerly
breezes
that
evening
it
began
to
snow
with
the
wind
strong
in
the
east
me
and
idaho
moved
camp
into
an
old
empty
cabin
higher
up
the
mountain
thinking
it
was
only
a
november
flurry
but
after
falling
three
foot
on
a
level
it
went
to
work
in
earnest
and
we
knew
we
was
snowed
in
we
got
in
plenty
of
firewood
before
it
got
deep
and
we
had
grub
enough
for
two
months
so
we
let
the
elements
rage
and
cut
up
all
they
thought
proper
if
you
want
to
instigate
the
art
of
manslaughter
just
shut
two
men
up
in
a
eighteen
by
cabin
for
a
month
human
nature
stand
it
when
the
first
snowflakes
fell
me
and
idaho
green
laughed
at
each
other
jokes
and
praised
the
stuff
we
turned
out
of
a
skillet
and
called
bread
at
the
end
of
three
weeks
idaho
makes
this
kind
of
a
edict
to
me
says
he
i
never
exactly
heard
sour
milk
dropping
out
of
a
balloon
on
the
bottom
of
a
tin
pan
but
i
have
an
idea
it
would
be
music
of
the
spears
compared
to
this
attenuated
stream
of
asphyxiated
thought
that
emanates
out
of
your
organs
of
conversation
the
kind
of
masticated
noises
that
you
emit
every
day
puts
me
in
mind
of
a
cud
only
she
lady
enough
to
keep
hers
to
herself
and
you
ai
green
says
i
you
having
been
a
friend
of
mine
once
i
have
some
hesitations
in
confessing
to
you
that
if
i
had
my
choice
for
society
between
you
and
a
common
yellow
cur
pup
one
of
the
inmates
of
this
here
cabin
would
be
wagging
a
tail
just
at
present
this
way
we
goes
on
for
two
or
three
days
and
then
we
quits
speaking
to
one
another
we
divides
up
the
cooking
implements
and
idaho
cooks
his
grub
on
one
side
of
the
fireplace
and
me
on
the
other
the
snow
is
up
to
the
windows
and
we
have
to
keep
a
fire
all
day
you
see
me
and
idaho
never
had
any
education
beyond
reading
and
doing
if
john
had
three
apples
and
james
five
on
a
slate
we
never
felt
any
special
need
for
a
university
degree
though
we
had
acquired
a
species
of
intrinsic
intelligence
in
knocking
around
the
world
that
we
could
use
in
emergencies
but
snowbound
in
that
cabin
in
the
bitter
roots
we
felt
for
the
first
time
that
if
we
had
studied
homer
or
greek
and
fractions
and
the
higher
branches
of
information
we
have
had
some
resources
in
the
line
of
meditation
and
private
thought
seen
them
eastern
college
fellows
working
in
camps
all
through
the
west
and
i
never
noticed
but
what
education
was
less
of
a
drawback
to
than
you
would
think
why
once
over
on
snake
river
when
andrew
mcwilliams
saddle
horse
got
the
botts
he
sent
a
buckboard
ten
miles
for
one
of
these
strangers
that
claimed
to
be
a
botanist
but
that
horse
died
one
morning
idaho
was
poking
around
with
a
stick
on
top
of
a
little
shelf
that
was
too
high
to
reach
two
books
fell
down
to
the
floor
i
started
toward
but
caught
idaho
eye
he
speaks
for
the
first
time
in
a
week
do
burn
your
fingers
says
he
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
only
fit
to
be
the
companion
of
a
sleeping
i
give
you
a
square
deal
and
that
more
than
your
parents
did
when
they
turned
you
loose
in
the
world
with
the
sociability
of
a
and
the
bedside
manner
of
a
frozen
turnip
i
play
you
a
game
of
the
winner
to
pick
up
his
choice
of
the
book
the
loser
to
take
the
other
we
played
and
idaho
won
he
picked
up
his
book
and
i
took
mine
then
each
of
us
got
on
his
side
of
the
house
and
went
to
reading
i
never
was
as
glad
to
see
a
nugget
as
i
was
that
book
and
idaho
took
at
his
like
a
kid
looks
at
a
stick
of
candy
mine
was
a
little
book
about
five
by
six
inches
called
handbook
of
indispensable
information
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
think
that
was
the
greatest
book
that
ever
was
written
i
got
it
and
i
can
stump
you
or
any
man
fifty
times
in
five
minutes
with
the
information
in
it
talk
about
solomon
or
the
new
york
herkimer
had
cases
on
both
of
that
man
must
have
put
in
fifty
years
and
travelled
a
million
miles
to
find
out
all
that
stuff
there
was
the
population
of
all
cities
in
it
and
the
way
to
tell
a
age
and
the
number
of
teeth
a
camel
has
it
told
you
the
longest
tunnel
in
the
world
the
number
of
the
stars
how
long
it
takes
for
chicken
pox
to
break
out
what
a
lady
neck
ought
to
measure
the
veto
powers
of
governors
the
dates
of
the
roman
aqueducts
how
many
pounds
of
rice
going
without
three
beers
a
day
would
buy
the
average
annual
temperature
of
augusta
maine
the
quantity
of
seed
required
to
plant
an
acre
of
carrots
in
drills
antidotes
for
poisons
the
number
of
hairs
on
a
blond
lady
head
how
to
preserve
eggs
the
height
of
all
the
mountains
in
the
world
and
the
dates
of
all
wars
and
battles
and
how
to
restore
drowned
persons
and
sunstroke
and
the
number
of
tacks
in
a
pound
and
how
to
make
dynamite
and
flowers
and
beds
and
what
to
do
before
the
doctor
comes
and
a
hundred
times
as
many
things
besides
if
there
was
anything
herkimer
did
know
i
did
miss
it
out
of
the
book
i
sat
and
read
that
book
for
four
hours
all
the
wonders
of
education
was
compressed
in
it
i
forgot
the
snow
and
i
forgot
that
me
and
old
idaho
was
on
the
outs
he
was
sitting
still
on
a
stool
reading
away
with
a
kind
of
partly
soft
and
partly
mysterious
look
shining
through
his
whiskers
idaho
says
i
what
kind
of
a
book
is
yours
idaho
must
have
forgot
too
for
he
answered
moderate
without
any
slander
or
malignity
why
says
he
this
here
seems
to
be
a
volume
by
homer
homer
m
what
i
asks
why
just
homer
says
he
you
a
liar
says
i
a
little
riled
that
idaho
should
try
to
put
me
up
a
tree
no
man
is
going
signing
books
with
his
initials
if
it
homer
spoopendyke
or
homer
mcsweeney
or
homer
jones
why
do
you
say
so
like
a
man
instead
of
biting
off
the
end
of
it
like
a
calf
chewing
off
the
tail
of
a
shirt
on
a
line
i
put
it
to
you
straight
sandy
says
idaho
quiet
it
a
poem
book
says
he
by
homer
i
could
get
colour
out
of
it
at
first
but
there
a
vein
if
you
follow
it
up
i
would
have
missed
this
book
for
a
pair
of
red
blankets
you
welcome
to
it
says
i
what
i
want
is
a
disinterested
statement
of
facts
for
the
mind
to
work
on
and
that
what
i
seem
to
find
in
the
book
i
drawn
what
you
got
says
idaho
is
statistics
the
lowest
grade
of
information
that
exists
they
poison
your
mind
give
me
old
system
of
surmises
he
seems
to
be
a
kind
of
a
wine
agent
his
regular
toast
is
doing
and
he
seems
to
have
a
grouch
but
he
keeps
it
so
well
lubricated
with
booze
that
his
worst
kicks
sound
like
an
invitation
to
split
a
quart
but
it
poetry
says
idaho
and
i
have
sensations
of
scorn
for
that
truck
of
yours
that
tries
to
convey
sense
in
feet
and
inches
when
it
comes
to
explaining
the
instinct
of
philosophy
through
the
art
of
nature
old
has
got
your
man
beat
by

so
that
the
way
me
and
idaho
had
it
day
and
night
all
the
excitement
we
got
was
studying
our
books
that
snowstorm
sure
fixed
us
with
a
fine
lot
of
attainments
apiece
by
the
time
the
snow
melted
if
you
had
stepped
up
to
me
suddenly
and
said
sanderson
pratt
what
would
it
cost
per
square
foot
to
lay
a
roof
with
twenty
by
eight
tin
at
nine
dollars
and
fifty
cents
per
box
i
have
told
you
as
quick
as
light
could
travel
the
length
of
a
spade
handle
at
the
rate
of
one
hundred
and
thousand
miles
per
second
how
many
can
do
it
you
wake
up
any
man
you
know
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
ask
him
quick
to
tell
you
the
number
of
bones
in
the
human
skeleton
exclusive
of
the
teeth
or
what
percentage
of
the
vote
of
the
nebraska
legislature
overrules
a
veto
will
he
tell
you
try
him
and
see
about
what
benefit
idaho
got
out
of
his
poetry
book
i
did
exactly
know
idaho
boosted
the
every
time
he
opened
his
mouth
but
i
was
so
sure
this
homer
from
what
leaked
out
of
his
libretto
through
idaho
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
kind
of
a
dog
who
looked
at
life
like
it
was
a
tin
can
tied
to
his
tail
after
running
himself
half
to
death
he
sits
down
hangs
his
tongue
out
and
looks
at
the
can
and
says
oh
well
since
we
ca
shake
the
growler
let
get
it
filled
at
the
corner
and
all
have
a
drink
on
me
besides
that
it
seems
he
was
a
persian
and
i
never
hear
of
persia
producing
anything
worth
mentioning
unless
it
was
turkish
rugs
and
maltese
cats
that
spring
me
and
idaho
struck
pay
ore
it
was
a
habit
of
ours
to
sell
out
quick
and
keep
moving
we
unloaded
our
grubstaker
for
eight
thousand
dollars
apiece
and
then
we
drifted
down
to
this
little
town
of
rosa
on
the
salmon
river
to
rest
up
and
get
some
human
grub
and
have
our
whiskers
harvested
rosa
was
no
it
laid
in
the
valley
and
was
as
free
of
uproar
and
pestilence
as
one
of
them
rural
towns
in
the
country
there
was
a
trolley
line
champing
its
bit
in
the
environs
and
me
and
idaho
spent
a
week
riding
on
one
of
the
cars
dropping
off
at
nights
at
the
sunset
view
hotel
being
now
well
read
as
well
as
travelled
we
was
soon
re
with
the
best
society
in
rosa
and
was
invited
out
to
the
most
and
entertainments
it
was
at
a
piano
recital
and
contest
in
the
city
hall
for
the
benefit
of
the
fire
company
that
me
and
idaho
first
met
de
ormond
sampson
the
queen
of
rosa
society
sampson
was
a
widow
and
owned
the
only
house
in
town
it
was
painted
yellow
and
whichever
way
you
looked
from
you
could
see
it
as
plain
as
egg
on
the
chin
of
an
on
a
friday
men
in
rosa
besides
me
and
idaho
was
trying
to
stake
a
claim
on
that
yellow
house
there
was
a
dance
after
the
song
books
and
quail
bones
had
been
raked
out
of
the
hall
of
the
bunch
galloped
over
to
sampson
and
asked
for
a
dance
i
the
and
asked
permission
to
escort
her
home
that
where
i
made
a
hit
on
the
way
home
says
she
ai
the
stars
lovely
and
bright
mr
pratt
for
the
chance
they
got
says
i
they
humping
themselves
in
a
mighty
creditable
way
that
big
one
you
see
is
million
miles
distant
it
took
years
for
its
light
to
reach
us
with
an
telescope
you
can
see
millions
of
including
them
of
the
thirteenth
magnitude
which
if
one
was
to
go
out
now
you
would
keep
on
seeing
it
for
hundred
years
my
says
sampson
i
never
knew
that
before
how
warm
it
is
i
as
damp
as
i
can
be
from
dancing
so
much
that
easy
to
account
for
says
i
when
you
happen
to
know
that
you
got
two
million
working
all
at
once
if
every
one
of
your
perspiratory
ducts
which
are
a
quarter
of
an
inch
long
was
placed
end
to
end
they
would
reach
a
distance
of
seven
miles
lawsy
says
sampson
it
sounds
like
an
irrigation
ditch
you
was
describing
pratt
how
do
you
get
all
this
knowledge
of
information
from
observation
sampson
i
tells
her
i
keep
my
eyes
open
when
i
go
about
the
world
pratt
says
she
i
always
did
admire
a
man
of
education
there
are
so
few
scholars
among
the
of
this
town
that
it
is
a
real
pleasure
to
converse
with
a
gentleman
of
culture
i
be
gratified
to
have
you
call
at
my
house
whenever
you
feel
so
inclined
and
that
was
the
way
i
got
the
goodwill
of
the
lady
in
the
yellow
house
every
tuesday
and
friday
evening
i
used
to
go
there
and
tell
her
about
the
wonders
of
the
universe
as
discovered
tabulated
and
compiled
from
nature
by
herkimer
idaho
and
the
other
gay
lutherans
of
the
town
got
every
minute
of
the
rest
of
the
week
that
they
could
i
never
imagined
that
idaho
was
trying
to
work
on
sampson
with
old
rules
of
courtship
till
one
afternoon
when
i
was
on
my
way
over
to
take
her
a
basket
of
wild
i
met
the
lady
coming
down
the
lane
that
led
to
her
house
her
eyes
was
snapping
and
her
hat
made
a
dangerous
dip
over
one
eye
pratt
she
opens
up
this
green
is
a
friend
of
yours
i
believe
for
nine
years
says
i
cut
him
out
says
she
he
no
gentleman
why
says
i
he
a
plain
incumbent
of
the
mountains
with
asperities
and
the
usual
failings
of
a
spendthrift
and
a
liar
but
i
never
on
the
most
momentous
occasion
had
the
heart
to
deny
that
he
was
a
gentleman
it
may
be
that
in
haberdashery
and
the
sense
of
arrogance
and
display
idaho
offends
the
eye
but
inside
i
found
him
impervious
to
the
lower
grades
of
crime
and
obesity
after
nine
years
of
idaho
society
sampson
i
winds
up
i
should
hate
to
impute
him
and
i
should
hate
to
see
him
imputed
it
right
plausible
of
you
pratt
says
sampson
to
take
up
the
curmudgeons
in
your
friend
behalf
but
it
do
alter
the
fact
that
he
has
made
proposals
to
me
sufficiently
obnoxious
to
ruffle
the
ignominy
of
any
lady
why
now
now
now
says
i
old
idaho
do
that
i
could
believe
it
of
myself
sooner
i
never
knew
but
one
thing
to
deride
in
him
and
a
blizzard
was
responsible
for
that
once
while
we
was
in
the
mountains
he
became
a
prey
to
a
kind
of
spurious
and
uneven
poetry
which
may
have
corrupted
his
demeanour
it
has
says
sampson
ever
since
i
knew
him
he
has
been
reciting
to
me
a
lot
of
irreligious
rhymes
by
some
person
he
calls
ruby
ott
and
who
is
no
better
than
she
should
be
if
you
judge
by
her
poetry
then
idaho
has
struck
a
new
book
says
i
for
the
one
he
had
was
by
a
man
who
writes
under
the
de
of
he
better
have
stuck
to
it
says
sampson
whatever
it
was
and
he
caps
the
vortex
i
get
a
bunch
of
flowers
from
him
and
on
is
pinned
a
note
now
pratt
you
know
a
lady
when
you
see
her
and
you
know
how
i
stand
in
rosa
society
do
you
think
for
a
moment
that
i
skip
out
to
the
woods
with
a
man
along
with
a
jug
of
wine
and
a
loaf
of
bread
and
go
singing
and
cavorting
up
and
down
under
the
trees
with
him
i
take
a
little
claret
with
my
meals
but
i
not
in
the
habit
of
packing
a
jug
of
it
into
the
brush
and
raising
cain
in
any
such
style
as
that
and
of
course
he
bring
his
book
of
verses
along
too
he
said
so
let
him
go
on
his
scandalous
picnics
alone
or
let
him
take
his
ruby
ott
with
him
i
reckon
she
kick
unless
it
was
on
account
of
there
being
too
much
bread
along
and
what
do
you
think
of
your
gentleman
friend
now
mr
pratt
well
says
i
it
may
be
that
idaho
invitation
was
a
kind
of
poetry
and
meant
no
harm
may
be
it
belonged
to
the
class
of
rhymes
they
call
figurative
they
offend
law
and
order
but
they
get
sent
through
the
mails
on
the
grounds
that
they
mean
something
that
they
do
say
i
be
glad
on
idaho
account
if
you
overlook
it
says
i
and
let
us
extricate
our
minds
from
the
low
regions
of
poetry
to
the
higher
planes
of
fact
and
fancy
on
a
beautiful
afternoon
like
this
sampson
i
goes
on
we
should
let
our
thoughts
dwell
accordingly
though
it
is
warm
here
we
should
remember
that
at
the
equator
the
line
of
perpetual
frost
is
at
an
altitude
of
fifteen
thousand
feet
between
the
latitudes
of
forty
degrees
and
degrees
it
is
from
four
thousand
to
nine
thousand
feet
oh
pratt
says
sampson
it
such
a
comfort
to
hear
you
say
them
beautiful
facts
after
getting
such
a
jar
from
that
minx
of
a
ruby
poetry
let
us
sit
on
this
log
at
the
roadside
says
i
and
forget
the
inhumanity
and
ribaldry
of
the
poets
it
is
in
the
glorious
columns
of
ascertained
facts
and
legalised
measures
that
beauty
is
to
be
found
in
this
very
log
we
sit
upon
sampson
says
i
is
statistics
more
wonderful
than
any
poem
the
rings
show
it
was
sixty
years
old
at
the
depth
of
two
thousand
feet
it
would
become
coal
in
three
thousand
years
the
deepest
coal
mine
in
the
world
is
at
killingworth
near
newcastle
a
box
four
feet
long
three
feet
wide
and
two
feet
eight
inches
deep
will
hold
one
ton
of
coal
if
an
artery
is
cut
compress
it
above
the
wound
a
man
leg
contains
thirty
bones
the
tower
of
london
was
burned
in
go
on
pratt
says
sampson
them
ideas
is
so
original
and
soothing
i
think
statistics
are
just
as
lovely
as
they
can
be
but
it
was
till
two
weeks
later
that
i
got
all
that
was
coming
to
me
out
of
herkimer
one
night
i
was
waked
up
by
folks
hollering
fire
all
around
i
jumped
up
and
dressed
and
went
out
of
the
hotel
to
enjoy
the
scene
when
i
see
it
was
sampson
house
i
gave
forth
a
kind
of
yell
and
i
was
there
in
two
minutes
the
whole
lower
story
of
the
yellow
house
was
in
flames
and
every
masculine
feminine
and
canine
in
rosa
was
there
screeching
and
barking
and
getting
in
the
way
of
the
firemen
i
saw
idaho
trying
to
get
away
from
six
firemen
who
were
holding
him
they
was
telling
him
the
whole
place
was
on
fire
and
no
man
could
go
in
it
and
come
out
alive
where
mrs
sampson
i
asks
she
has
been
seen
says
one
of
the
firemen
she
sleeps
stairs
we
tried
to
get
in
but
we
ca
and
our
company
got
any
ladders
yet
i
runs
around
to
the
light
of
the
big
blaze
and
pulls
the
handbook
out
of
my
inside
pocket
i
kind
of
laughed
when
i
felt
it
in
my
hands
i
reckon
i
was
some
daffy
with
the
sensation
of
excitement
herky
old
boy
i
says
to
it
as
i
flipped
over
the
pages
you
ai
ever
lied
to
me
yet
and
you
ai
ever
throwed
me
down
at
a
scratch
yet
tell
me
what
old
boy
tell
me
what
says
i
turned
to
what
to
do
in
case
of
accidents
on
page
i
run
my
finger
down
the
page
and
struck
it
good
old
herkimer
he
never
overlooked
anything
it
said
suffocation
from
inhaling
smoke
or
there
is
nothing
better
than
flaxseed
place
a
few
seed
in
the
outer
corner
of
the
eye
i
shoved
the
handbook
back
in
my
pocket
and
grabbed
a
boy
that
was
running
by
here
says
i
giving
him
some
money
run
to
the
drug
store
and
bring
a
dollar
worth
of
flaxseed
hurry
and
you
get
another
one
for
yourself
now
i
sings
out
to
the
crowd
we
have
mrs
sampson
and
i
throws
away
my
coat
and
hat
four
of
the
firemen
and
citizens
grabs
hold
of
me
it
sure
death
they
say
to
go
in
the
house
for
the
floors
was
beginning
to
fall
through
how
in
blazes
i
sings
out
kind
of
laughing
yet
but
not
feeling
like
it
do
you
expect
me
to
put
flaxseed
in
a
eye
without
the
eye
i
jabbed
each
elbow
in
a
fireman
face
kicked
the
bark
off
of
one
citizen
shin
and
tripped
the
other
one
with
a
side
hold
and
then
i
busted
into
the
house
if
i
die
first
i
write
you
a
letter
and
tell
you
if
it
any
worse
down
there
than
the
inside
of
that
yellow
house
was
but
do
believe
it
yet
i
was
a
heap
more
cooked
than
the
orders
of
broiled
chicken
that
you
get
in
restaurants
the
fire
and
smoke
had
me
down
on
the
floor
twice
and
was
about
to
shame
herkimer
but
the
firemen
helped
me
with
their
little
stream
of
water
and
i
got
to
sampson
room
she
lost
conscientiousness
from
the
smoke
so
i
wrapped
her
in
the
bed
clothes
and
got
her
on
my
shoulder
well
the
floors
was
as
bad
as
they
said
or
i
never
could
have
done
it
not
by
no
means
i
carried
her
out
fifty
yards
from
the
house
and
laid
her
on
the
grass
then
of
course
every
one
of
them
other
to
the
lady
hand
crowded
around
with
tin
dippers
of
water
ready
to
save
her
and
up
runs
the
boy
with
the
flaxseed
i
unwrapped
the
covers
from
sampson
head
she
opened
her
eyes
and
says
is
that
you
mr
pratt
says
i
do
talk
till
you
had
the
remedy
i
runs
my
arm
around
her
neck
and
raises
her
head
gentle
and
breaks
the
bag
of
flaxseed
with
the
other
hand
and
as
easy
as
i
could
i
bends
over
and
slips
three
or
four
of
the
seeds
in
the
outer
corner
of
her
eye
up
gallops
the
village
doc
by
this
time
and
snorts
around
and
grabs
at
sampson
pulse
and
wants
to
know
what
i
mean
by
any
such
sandblasted
nonsense
well
old
jalap
and
jerusalem
oakseed
says
i
i
no
regular
practitioner
but
i
show
you
my
authority
anyway
they
fetched
my
coat
and
i
gets
out
the
handbook
look
on
page
says
i
at
the
remedy
for
suffocation
by
smoke
or
gas
flaxseed
in
the
outer
corner
of
the
eye
it
says
i
do
know
whether
it
works
as
a
smoke
consumer
or
whether
it
hikes
the
compound
nerve
into
action
but
herkimer
says
it
and
he
was
called
to
the
case
first
if
you
want
to
make
it
a
consultation
there
no
objection
old
doc
takes
the
book
and
looks
at
it
by
means
of
his
specs
and
a
fireman
lantern
well
pratt
says
he
you
evidently
got
on
the
wrong
line
in
reading
your
diagnosis
the
recipe
for
suffocation
says
the
patient
into
fresh
air
as
quickly
as
possible
and
place
in
a
reclining
position
the
flaxseed
remedy
is
for
and
cinders
in
the
eye
on
the
line
above
but
after
all
see
here
interrupts
sampson
i
reckon
i
got
something
to
say
in
this
consultation
that
flaxseed
done
me
more
good
than
anything
i
ever
tried
and
then
she
raises
up
her
head
and
lays
it
back
on
my
arm
again
and
says
put
some
in
the
other
eye
sandy
dear
and
so
if
you
was
to
stop
off
at
rosa
or
any
other
day
you
see
a
fine
new
yellow
house
with
pratt
that
was
sampson
embellishing
and
adorning
it
and
if
you
was
to
step
inside
you
see
on
the
centre
table
in
the
parlour
handbook
of
indispensable
information
all
rebound
in
red
morocco
and
ready
to
be
consulted
on
any
subject
pertaining
to
human
happiness
and
wisdom
v
the
pimienta
pancakes
while
we
were
rounding
up
a
bunch
of
the
cattle
in
the
frio
bottoms
a
projecting
branch
of
a
dead
mesquite
caught
my
wooden
stirrup
and
gave
my
ankle
a
wrench
that
laid
me
up
in
camp
for
a
week
on
the
third
day
of
my
compulsory
idleness
i
crawled
out
near
the
grub
wagon
and
reclined
helpless
under
the
conversational
fire
of
judson
odom
the
camp
cook
jud
was
a
monologist
by
nature
whom
destiny
with
customary
blundering
had
set
in
a
profession
wherein
he
was
bereaved
for
the
greater
portion
of
his
time
of
an
audience
therefore
i
was
manna
in
the
desert
of
jud
obmutescence
betimes
i
was
stirred
by
invalid
longings
for
something
to
eat
that
did
not
come
under
the
caption
of
grub
i
had
visions
of
the
maternal
pantry
deep
as
first
love
and
wild
with
all
regret
and
then
i
asked
jud
can
you
make
pancakes
jud
laid
down
his
with
which
he
was
preparing
to
pound
an
antelope
steak
and
stood
over
me
in
what
i
felt
to
be
a
menacing
attitude
he
further
endorsed
my
impression
that
his
pose
was
resentful
by
fixing
upon
me
with
his
light
blue
eyes
a
look
of
cold
suspicion
say
you
he
said
with
candid
though
not
excessive
choler
did
you
mean
that
straight
or
was
you
trying
to
throw
the
gaff
into
me
some
of
the
boys
been
telling
you
about
me
and
that
pancake
racket
no
jud
i
said
sincerely
i
meant
it
it
seems
to
me
i
swap
my
pony
and
saddle
for
a
stack
of
buttered
brown
pancakes
with
some
first
crop
open
kettle
new
orleans
sweetening
was
there
a
story
about
pancakes
jud
was
mollified
at
once
when
he
saw
that
i
had
not
been
dealing
in
allusions
he
brought
some
mysterious
bags
and
tin
boxes
from
the
grub
wagon
and
set
them
in
the
shade
of
the
hackberry
where
i
lay
reclined
i
watched
him
as
he
began
to
arrange
them
leisurely
and
untie
their
many
strings
no
not
a
story
said
jud
as
he
worked
but
just
the
logical
disclosures
in
the
case
of
me
and
that
snoozer
from
mired
mule
canada
and
miss
willella
learight
i
do
mind
telling
you
i
was
punching
then
for
old
bill
toomey
on
the
san
miguel
one
day
i
gets
all
ensnared
up
in
aspirations
for
to
eat
some
canned
grub
that
has
ever
mooed
or
baaed
or
grunted
or
been
in
peck
measures
so
i
gets
on
my
bronc
and
pushes
the
wind
for
uncle
emsley
telfair
store
at
the
pimienta
crossing
on
the
nueces
about
three
in
the
afternoon
i
throwed
my
bridle
rein
over
a
mesquite
limb
and
walked
the
last
twenty
yards
into
uncle
emsley
store
i
got
up
on
the
counter
and
told
uncle
emsley
that
the
signs
pointed
to
the
devastation
of
the
fruit
crop
of
the
world
in
a
minute
i
had
a
bag
of
crackers
and
a
spoon
with
an
open
can
each
of
apricots
and
pineapples
and
cherries
and
greengages
beside
of
me
with
uncle
emsley
busy
chopping
away
with
the
hatchet
at
the
yellow
clings
i
was
feeling
like
adam
before
the
apple
stampede
and
was
digging
my
spurs
into
the
side
of
the
counter
and
working
with
my
spoon
when
i
happened
to
look
out
of
the
window
into
the
yard
of
uncle
emsley
house
which
was
next
to
the
store
there
was
a
girl
standing
there
an
imported
girl
with
fixings
on
philandering
with
a
croquet
maul
and
amusing
herself
by
watching
my
style
of
encouraging
the
fruit
canning
industry
i
slid
off
the
counter
and
delivered
up
my
shovel
to
uncle
emsley
my
niece
says
he
willella
learight
down
from
palestine
on
a
visit
do
you
want
that
i
should
make
you
acquainted
holy
land
i
says
to
myself
my
thoughts
milling
some
as
i
tried
to
run
into
the
corral
not
there
was
sure
angels
in
pales
why
yes
uncle
emsley
i
says
out
loud
be
awful
edified
to
meet
miss
learight
so
uncle
emsley
took
me
out
in
the
yard
and
gave
us
each
entitlements
i
never
was
shy
about
women
i
never
could
understand
why
some
men
who
can
break
a
mustang
before
breakfast
and
shave
in
the
dark
get
all
and
full
of
perspiration
and
excuses
when
they
see
a
bold
of
calico
draped
around
what
belongs
to
it
inside
of
eight
minutes
me
and
miss
willella
was
aggravating
the
croquet
balls
around
as
amiable
as
second
cousins
she
gave
me
a
dig
about
the
quantity
of
canned
fruit
i
had
eaten
and
i
got
back
at
her
about
how
a
certain
lady
named
eve
started
the
fruit
trouble
in
the
first
pasture
in
palestine
was
it
says
i
as
easy
and
pat
as
roping
a
that
was
how
i
acquired
cordiality
for
the
proximities
of
miss
willella
learight
and
the
disposition
grew
larger
as
time
passed
she
was
stopping
at
pimienta
crossing
for
her
health
which
was
very
good
and
for
the
climate
which
was
forty
per
cent
hotter
than
palestine
i
rode
over
to
see
her
once
every
week
for
a
while
and
then
i
figured
it
out
that
if
i
doubled
the
number
of
trips
i
would
see
her
twice
as
often
one
week
i
slipped
in
a
third
trip
and
that
where
the
pancakes
and
the
snoozer
busted
into
the
game
that
evening
while
i
set
on
the
counter
with
a
peach
and
two
damsons
in
my
mouth
i
asked
uncle
emsley
how
miss
willella
was
says
uncle
emsley
gone
riding
with
jackson
bird
the
sheep
man
from
over
at
mired
mule
canada
i
swallowed
the
peach
seed
and
the
two
damson
seeds
i
guess
somebody
held
the
counter
by
the
bridle
while
i
got
off
and
then
i
walked
out
straight
ahead
till
i
butted
against
the
mesquite
where
my
roan
was
tied
gone
riding
i
whisper
in
my
bronc
ear
birdstone
jack
the
hired
mule
from
sheep
man
canada
did
you
get
that
old
that
bronc
of
mine
wept
in
his
way
he
been
raised
a
cow
pony
and
he
did
care
for
snoozers
i
went
back
and
said
to
uncle
emsley
you
say
a
sheep
man
said
a
sheep
man
says
uncle
emsley
again
must
have
heard
tell
of
jackson
bird
he
got
eight
sections
of
grazing
and
four
thousand
head
of
the
finest
merinos
south
of
the
arctic
circle
i
went
out
and
sat
on
the
ground
in
the
shade
of
the
store
and
leaned
against
a
prickly
pear
i
sifted
sand
into
my
boots
with
unthinking
hands
while
i
soliloquised
a
quantity
about
this
bird
with
the
jackson
plumage
to
his
name
i
never
had
believed
in
harming
sheep
men
i
see
one
one
day
reading
a
latin
grammar
on
hossback
and
i
never
touched
him
they
never
irritated
me
like
they
do
most
cowmen
you
would
go
to
work
now
and
impair
and
disfigure
snoozers
would
you
that
eat
on
tables
and
wear
little
shoes
and
speak
to
you
on
subjects
i
had
always
let
pass
just
as
you
would
a
with
a
polite
word
and
a
guess
about
the
weather
but
no
stopping
to
swap
canteens
i
never
thought
it
was
worth
while
to
be
hostile
with
a
snoozer
and
because
i
been
lenient
and
let
live
here
was
one
going
around
riding
with
miss
willella
learight
an
hour
by
sun
they
come
loping
back
and
stopped
at
uncle
gate
the
sheep
person
helped
her
off
and
they
stood
throwing
each
other
sentences
all
sprightful
and
sagacious
for
a
while
and
then
this
feathered
jackson
flies
up
in
his
saddle
and
raises
his
little
stewpot
of
a
hat
and
trots
off
in
the
direction
of
his
mutton
ranch
by
this
time
i
had
turned
the
sand
out
of
my
boots
and
unpinned
myself
from
the
prickly
pear
and
by
the
time
he
gets
half
a
mile
out
of
pimienta
i
singlefoots
up
beside
him
on
my
bronc
i
said
that
snoozer
was
but
he
was
his
seeing
arrangement
was
grey
enough
but
his
was
pink
and
his
hair
was
sandy
and
that
gave
you
the
idea
sheep
man
he
was
more
than
a
lamb
man
anyhow
a
little
thing
with
his
neck
involved
in
a
yellow
silk
handkerchief
and
shoes
tied
up
in
bowknots
says
i
to
him
now
ride
with
a
equestrian
who
is
commonly
called
judson
on
account
of
the
way
i
shoot
when
i
want
a
stranger
to
know
me
i
always
introduce
myself
before
the
draw
for
i
never
did
like
to
shake
hands
with
ghosts
says
he
just
like
that
i
glad
to
know
you
judson
i
jackson
bird
from
over
at
mired
mule
ranch
just
then
one
of
my
eyes
saw
a
roadrunner
skipping
down
the
hill
with
a
young
tarantula
in
his
bill
and
the
other
eye
noticed
a
sitting
on
a
dead
limb
in
a
i
popped
over
one
after
the
other
with
my
just
to
show
him
out
of
three
says
i
just
naturally
seem
to
draw
my
fire
wherever
i
go
shooting
says
the
sheep
man
without
a
flutter
you
sometimes
ever
miss
the
third
shot
elegant
fine
rain
that
was
last
week
for
the
young
grass
mr
judson
says
he
says
i
riding
over
close
to
his
palfrey
infatuated
parents
may
have
denounced
you
by
the
name
of
jackson
but
you
sure
moulted
into
a
twittering
willie
let
us
slough
off
this
here
analysis
of
rain
and
the
elements
and
get
down
to
talk
that
is
outside
the
vocabulary
of
parrots
that
is
a
bad
habit
you
have
got
of
riding
with
young
ladies
over
at
pimienta
i
known
birds
says
i
be
served
on
toast
for
less
than
that
miss
willella
says
i
ever
want
any
nest
made
out
of
sheep
wool
by
a
tomtit
of
the
jacksonian
branch
of
ornithology
now
are
you
going
to
quit
or
do
you
wish
for
to
gallop
up
against
this
attachment
to
my
name
which
is
good
for
two
hyphens
and
at
least
one
set
of
funeral
obsequies
jackson
bird
flushed
up
some
and
then
he
laughed
judson
says
he
got
the
wrong
idea
i
called
on
miss
learight
a
few
times
but
not
for
the
purpose
you
imagine
my
object
is
purely
a
gastronomical
one
i
reached
for
my
gun
coyote
says
i
would
boast
of
dishonourable
a
minute
says
this
bird
i
explain
what
would
i
do
with
a
wife
if
you
ever
saw
that
ranch
of
mine
i
do
my
own
cooking
and
mending
eating
that
all
the
pleasure
i
get
out
of
sheep
raising
judson
did
you
ever
taste
the
pancakes
that
miss
learight
makes
no
i
told
him
never
was
advised
that
she
was
up
to
any
culinary
manoeuvres
golden
sunshine
says
he
by
the
ambrosial
fires
of
epicurus
i
give
two
years
of
my
life
to
get
the
recipe
for
making
them
pancakes
that
what
i
went
to
see
miss
learight
for
says
jackson
bird
i
have
been
able
to
get
it
from
her
an
old
recipe
that
been
in
the
family
for
years
they
hand
it
down
from
one
generation
to
another
but
they
do
give
it
away
to
outsiders
if
i
could
get
that
recipe
so
i
could
make
them
pancakes
for
myself
on
my
ranch
i
be
a
happy
man
says
bird
you
sure
i
says
to
him
it
ai
the
hand
that
mixes
the
pancakes
that
you
after
says
jackson
learight
is
a
mighty
nice
girl
but
i
can
assure
you
my
intentions
go
no
further
than
the
gastro
but
he
seen
my
hand
going
down
to
my
holster
and
he
changed
his
similitude
the
desire
to
procure
a
copy
of
the
pancake
recipe
he
finishes
ai
such
a
bad
little
man
says
i
trying
to
be
fair
was
thinking
some
of
making
orphans
of
your
sheep
but
i
let
you
fly
away
this
time
but
you
stick
to
pancakes
says
i
close
as
the
middle
one
of
a
stack
and
do
go
and
mistake
sentiments
for
syrup
or
there
be
singing
at
your
ranch
and
you
wo
hear
it
convince
you
that
i
am
sincere
says
the
sheep
man
ask
you
to
help
me
miss
learight
and
you
being
closer
friends
maybe
she
would
do
for
you
what
she
would
for
me
if
you
will
get
me
a
copy
of
that
pancake
recipe
i
give
you
my
word
that
i
never
call
upon
her
again
fair
i
says
and
i
shook
hands
with
jackson
bird
get
it
for
you
if
i
can
and
glad
to
oblige
and
he
turned
off
down
the
big
pear
flat
on
the
piedra
in
the
direction
of
mired
mule
and
i
steered
northwest
for
old
bill
toomey
ranch
it
was
five
days
afterward
when
i
got
another
chance
to
ride
over
to
pimienta
miss
willella
and
me
passed
a
gratifying
evening
at
uncle
emsley
she
sang
some
and
exasperated
the
piano
quite
a
lot
with
quotations
from
the
operas
i
gave
imitations
of
a
rattlesnake
and
told
her
about
snaky
mcfee
new
way
of
skinning
cows
and
described
the
trip
i
made
to
saint
louis
once
we
was
getting
along
in
one
another
estimations
fine
thinks
i
if
jackson
bird
can
now
be
persuaded
to
migrate
i
win
i
recollect
his
promise
about
the
pancake
receipt
and
i
thinks
i
will
persuade
it
from
miss
willella
and
give
it
to
him
and
then
if
i
catches
birdie
off
of
mired
mule
again
make
him
hop
the
twig
so
along
about
ten
i
put
on
a
wheedling
smile
and
says
to
miss
willella
if
there
anything
i
do
like
better
than
the
sight
of
a
red
steer
on
green
grass
it
the
taste
of
a
nice
hot
pancake
smothered
in
molasses
miss
willella
gives
a
little
jump
on
the
piano
stool
and
looked
at
me
curious
says
she
real
nice
what
did
you
say
was
the
name
of
that
street
in
saint
louis
odom
where
you
lost
your
hat
avenue
says
i
with
a
wink
to
show
her
that
i
was
on
about
the
family
receipt
and
could
be
off
of
the
subject
now
miss
willella
i
says
hear
how
you
make
pancakes
is
just
whirling
in
my
head
like
wagon
wheels
start
her
off
now
pound
of
flour
eight
dozen
eggs
and
so
on
how
does
the
catalogue
of
constituents
run
me
for
a
moment
please
says
miss
willella
and
she
gives
me
a
quick
kind
of
sideways
look
and
slides
off
the
stool
she
ambled
out
into
the
other
room
and
directly
uncle
emsley
comes
in
in
his
shirt
sleeves
with
a
pitcher
of
water
he
turns
around
to
get
a
glass
on
the
table
and
i
see
a
in
his
hip
pocket
holes
thinks
i
here
a
family
thinks
a
heap
of
cooking
receipts
protecting
it
with
firearms
i
known
outfits
that
would
do
that
much
by
a
family
feud
this
here
down
says
uncle
emsley
handing
me
the
glass
of
water
rid
too
far
jud
and
got
yourself
try
to
think
about
something
else
now
you
know
how
to
make
them
pancakes
uncle
emsley
i
asked
i
not
as
apprised
in
the
anatomy
of
them
as
some
says
uncle
emsley
i
reckon
you
take
a
sifter
of
plaster
of
paris
and
a
little
dough
and
saleratus
and
corn
meal
and
mix
with
eggs
and
buttermilk
as
usual
is
old
bill
going
to
ship
beeves
to
kansas
city
again
this
spring
jud
that
was
all
the
pancake
specifications
i
could
get
that
night
i
did
wonder
that
jackson
bird
found
it
uphill
work
so
i
dropped
the
subject
and
talked
with
uncle
emsley
for
a
while
about
and
cyclones
and
then
miss
willella
came
and
said
and
i
hit
the
breeze
for
the
ranch
about
a
week
afterward
i
met
jackson
bird
riding
out
of
pimienta
as
i
rode
in
and
we
stopped
on
the
road
for
a
few
frivolous
remarks
the
bill
of
particulars
for
them
flapjacks
yet
i
asked
him
no
says
jackson
do
seem
to
have
any
success
in
getting
hold
of
it
did
you
try
did
says
i
was
like
trying
to
dig
a
prairie
dog
out
of
his
hole
with
a
peanut
hull
that
pancake
receipt
must
be
a
jookalorum
the
way
they
hold
on
to
it
most
ready
to
give
it
up
says
jackson
so
discouraged
in
his
pronunciations
that
i
felt
sorry
for
him
i
did
want
to
know
how
to
make
them
pancakes
to
eat
on
my
lonely
ranch
says
he
lie
awake
at
nights
thinking
how
good
they
are
keep
on
trying
for
it
i
tells
him
i
do
the
same
one
of
us
is
bound
to
get
a
rope
over
its
horns
before
long
well
long
jacksy
you
see
by
this
time
we
were
on
the
peacefullest
of
terms
when
i
saw
that
he
was
after
miss
willella
i
had
more
endurable
contemplations
of
that
snoozer
in
order
to
help
out
the
ambitions
of
his
appetite
i
kept
on
trying
to
get
that
receipt
from
miss
willella
but
every
time
i
would
say
she
would
get
sort
of
remote
and
fidgety
about
the
eye
and
try
to
change
the
subject
if
i
held
her
to
it
she
would
slide
out
and
round
up
uncle
emsley
with
his
pitcher
of
water
and
howitzer
one
day
i
galloped
over
to
the
store
with
a
fine
bunch
of
blue
verbenas
that
i
cut
out
of
a
herd
of
wild
flowers
over
on
poisoned
dog
prairie
uncle
emsley
looked
at
with
one
eye
shut
and
says
ye
heard
the
news
up
i
asks
and
jackson
bird
was
married
in
palestine
yesterday
says
he
got
a
letter
this
morning
i
dropped
them
flowers
in
a
and
let
the
news
trickle
in
my
ears
and
down
toward
my
upper
shirt
pocket
until
it
got
to
my
feet
you
mind
saying
that
over
again
once
more
uncle
emsley
says
i
my
hearing
has
got
wrong
and
you
only
said
that
prime
heifers
was
on
the
hoof
or
something
like
that
yesterday
says
uncle
emsley
gone
to
waco
and
niagara
falls
on
a
wedding
tour
why
did
you
see
none
of
the
signs
all
along
jackson
bird
has
been
courting
willella
ever
since
that
day
he
took
her
out
riding
says
i
in
a
kind
of
yell
was
all
this
zizzaparoola
he
gives
me
about
pancakes
tell
me
when
i
said
uncle
emsley
sort
of
dodged
and
stepped
back

dealing
me
pancakes
from
the
bottom
of
the
deck
i
says
i
find
out
i
believe
you
know
talk
up
says
i
we
mix
a
panful
of
batter
right
here
i
slid
over
the
counter
after
uncle
emsley
he
grabbed
at
his
gun
but
it
was
in
a
drawer
and
he
missed
it
two
inches
i
got
him
by
the
front
of
his
shirt
and
shoved
him
in
a
corner
pancakes
says
i
be
made
into
one
does
miss
willella
make
never
made
one
in
her
life
and
i
never
saw
one
says
uncle
emsley
soothing
down
now
jud
calm
down
you
got
excited
and
that
wound
in
your
head
is
contaminating
your
sense
of
intelligence
try
not
to
think
about
pancakes
emsley
says
i
not
wounded
in
the
head
except
so
far
as
my
natural
cognitive
instincts
run
to
runts
jackson
bird
told
me
he
was
calling
on
miss
willella
for
the
purpose
of
finding
out
her
system
of
producing
pancakes
and
he
asked
me
to
help
him
get
the
bill
of
lading
of
the
ingredients
i
done
so
with
the
results
as
you
see
have
i
been
sodded
down
with
johnson
grass
by
a
snoozer
or
what
up
your
grip
in
my
dress
shirt
says
uncle
emsley
tell
you
yes
it
looks
like
jackson
bird
has
gone
and
humbugged
you
some
the
day
after
he
went
riding
with
willella
he
came
back
and
told
me
and
her
to
watch
out
for
you
whenever
you
got
to
talking
about
pancakes
he
said
you
was
in
camp
once
where
they
was
cooking
flapjacks
and
one
of
the
fellows
cut
you
over
the
head
with
a
frying
pan
jackson
said
that
whenever
you
got
overhot
or
excited
that
wound
hurt
you
and
made
you
kind
of
crazy
and
you
went
raving
about
pancakes
he
told
us
to
just
get
you
worked
off
of
the
subject
and
soothed
down
and
you
would
be
dangerous
so
me
and
willella
done
the
best
by
you
we
knew
how
well
well
says
uncle
emsley
jackson
bird
is
sure
a
seldom
kind
of
a
snoozer
during
the
progress
of
jud
story
he
had
been
slowly
but
deftly
combining
certain
portions
of
the
contents
of
his
sacks
and
cans
toward
the
close
of
it
he
set
before
me
the
finished
product
a
pair
of
pancakes
on
a
tin
plate
from
some
secret
hoarding
he
also
brought
a
lump
of
excellent
butter
and
a
bottle
of
golden
syrup
how
long
ago
did
these
things
happen
i
asked
him
three
years
said
jud
they
living
on
the
mired
mule
ranch
now
but
i
have
seen
either
of
since
they
say
jackson
bird
was
fixing
his
ranch
up
fine
with
rocking
chairs
and
window
curtains
all
the
time
he
was
putting
me
up
the
pancake
tree
oh
i
got
over
it
after
a
while
but
the
boys
kept
the
racket
up
did
you
make
these
cakes
by
the
famous
recipe
i
asked
did
i
tell
you
there
was
no
receipt
said
jud
the
boys
hollered
pancakes
till
they
got
pancake
hungry
and
i
cut
this
recipe
out
of
a
newspaper
how
does
the
truck
taste
they
delicious
i
answered
why
do
you
have
some
too
jud
i
was
sure
i
heard
a
sigh
me
said
jud
i
do
ever
eat
vi
seats
of
the
haughty
golden
by
day
and
silver
by
night
a
new
trail
now
leads
to
us
across
the
indian
ocean
dusky
kings
and
princes
have
found
our
bombay
of
the
west
and
few
be
their
trails
that
do
not
lead
down
to
broadway
on
their
journey
for
to
admire
and
for
to
see
if
chance
should
ever
lead
you
near
a
hotel
that
transiently
shelters
some
one
of
these
splendid
touring
grandees
i
counsel
you
to
seek
lucullus
polk
among
the
republican
that
besiege
its
entrances
he
will
be
there
you
will
know
him
by
his
red
alert
face
by
his
manner
of
nervous
caution
mingled
with
determination
by
his
assumed
promoter
or
broker
air
of
busy
impatience
and
by
his
necktie
gallantly
redressing
the
wrongs
of
his
maltreated
blue
serge
suit
like
a
battle
standard
still
waving
above
a
lost
cause
i
found
him
profitable
and
so
may
you
when
you
do
look
for
him
look
among
the
troop
of
bedouins
that
besiege
the
of
the
travelling
potentate
guards
and
secretaries
among
the
genii
of
arabian
afternoons
that
gather
to
make
astounding
and
egregrious
demands
upon
the
coffers
i
first
saw
polk
coming
down
the
steps
of
the
hotel
at
which
sojourned
his
highness
the
gaekwar
of
baroda
most
enlightened
of
the
mahratta
princes
who
of
late
ate
bread
and
salt
in
our
metropolis
of
the
occident
lucullus
moved
rapidly
as
though
propelled
by
some
potent
moral
force
that
imminently
threatened
to
become
physical
behind
him
closely
followed
the
impetus
a
hotel
detective
if
ever
white
alpine
hat
hawk
nose
implacable
watch
chain
and
loud
refinement
of
manner
spoke
the
truth
a
brace
of
uniformed
porters
at
his
heels
preserved
the
smooth
decorum
of
the
hotel
repudiating
by
their
air
of
disengagement
any
suspicion
that
they
formed
a
reserve
squad
of
ejectment
safe
on
the
sidewalk
lucullus
polk
turned
and
shook
a
freckled
fist
at
the
caravansary
and
to
my
joy
he
began
to
breathe
deep
invective
in
strange
words
rides
in
howdays
does
he
he
cried
loudly
and
sneeringly
rides
on
elephants
in
howdahs
and
calls
himself
a
prince
kings
yah
comes
over
here
and
talks
horse
till
you
would
think
he
was
a
president
and
then
goes
home
and
rides
in
a
private
strapped
onto
an
elephant
well
well
well
the
ejecting
committee
quietly
retired
the
scorner
of
princes
turned
to
me
and
snapped
his
fingers
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
shouted
derisively
the
gaekwar
of
baroda
rides
in
an
elephant
in
a
howdah
and
there
old
bikram
shamsher
jang
scorching
up
and
down
the
of
khatmandu
on
a
would
that
maharajah
you
and
the
shah
of
persia
that
ought
to
have
been
for
at
least
three
he
got
the
palanquin
habit
and
that
prince
from
korea
would
you
think
he
could
afford
to
amble
around
on
a
palfrey
once
in
a
dynasty
or
two
nothing
doing
his
idea
of
a
balaklava
charge
is
to
tuck
his
skirts
under
him
and
do
his
mile
in
six
days
over
the
wallows
of
seoul
in
a
that
the
kind
of
visiting
potentates
that
come
to
this
country
now
it
a
hard
deal
friend
i
murmured
a
few
words
of
sympathy
but
it
was
uncomprehending
for
i
did
not
know
his
grievance
against
the
rulers
who
flash
now
and
then
upon
our
shores
the
last
one
i
sold
continued
the
displeased
one
was
to
that
turkish
pasha
that
came
over
a
year
ago
five
hundred
dollars
he
paid
for
it
easy
i
says
to
his
executioner
or
secretary
he
was
a
kind
of
a
jew
or
a
chinaman
turkey
gibbets
is
fond
of
horses
then
says
the
secretary
no
he
got
a
big
fat
wife
in
the
harem
named
bad
dora
that
he
do
like
i
believe
he
intends
to
saddle
her
up
and
ride
her
up
and
down
the
in
the
bulbul
gardens
a
few
times
every
day
you
have
got
a
pair
of
spurs
you
could
throw
in
on
the
deal
have
you
yes
sir
mighty
few
real
among
the
royal
sports
these
days
as
soon
as
lucullus
polk
got
cool
enough
i
picked
him
up
and
with
no
greater
effort
than
you
would
employ
in
persuading
a
drowning
man
to
clutch
a
straw
i
inveigled
him
into
accompanying
me
to
a
cool
corner
in
a
dim
cafe
and
it
came
to
pass
that
set
before
us
brewage
and
lucullus
polk
spake
unto
me
relating
the
wherefores
of
his
beleaguering
the
antechambers
of
the
princes
of
the
earth
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
railroad
in
texas
well
that
do
stand
for
samaritan
actor
aid
philanthropy
i
was
down
that
way
managing
a
summer
bunch
of
the
gum
and
that
play
the
idlewild
parks
in
the
western
hamlets
of
course
we
went
to
pieces
when
the
soubrette
ran
away
with
a
prominent
barber
of
beeville
i
do
know
what
became
of
the
rest
of
the
company
i
believe
there
were
some
salaries
due
and
the
last
i
saw
of
the
troupe
was
when
i
told
them
that
cents
was
all
the
treasury
contained
i
say
i
never
saw
any
of
them
after
that
but
i
heard
them
for
about
twenty
minutes
i
did
have
time
to
look
back
but
after
dark
i
came
out
of
the
woods
and
struck
the
agent
for
means
of
transportation
he
at
once
extended
to
me
the
courtesies
of
the
entire
railroad
kindly
warning
me
however
not
to
get
aboard
any
of
the
rolling
stock
about
ten
the
next
morning
i
steps
off
the
ties
into
a
village
that
calls
itself
atascosa
city
i
bought
a
breakfast
and
a
cigar
and
stood
on
the
main
street
jingling
the
three
pennies
in
my
pocket
dead
broke
a
man
in
texas
with
only
three
cents
in
his
pocket
is
no
better
off
than
a
man
that
has
no
money
and
owes
two
cents
one
of
luck
favourite
tricks
is
to
soak
a
man
for
his
last
dollar
so
quick
that
he
do
have
time
to
look
it
there
i
was
in
a
swell
louis
plaid
suit
and
an
carat
with
no
hope
in
sight
except
the
two
great
texas
industries
the
cotton
fields
and
grading
new
railroads
i
never
picked
cotton
and
i
never
cottoned
to
a
pick
so
the
outlook
had
ultramarine
edges
all
of
a
sudden
while
i
was
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
wooden
sidewalk
down
out
of
the
sky
falls
two
fine
gold
watches
in
the
middle
of
the
street
one
hits
a
chunk
of
mud
and
sticks
the
other
falls
hard
and
flies
open
making
a
fine
drizzle
of
little
springs
and
screws
and
wheels
i
looks
up
for
a
balloon
or
an
airship
but
not
seeing
any
i
steps
off
the
sidewalk
to
investigate
but
i
hear
a
couple
of
yells
and
see
two
men
running
up
the
street
in
leather
overalls
and
boots
and
cartwheel
hats
one
man
is
six
or
eight
feet
high
with
joints
and
a
heartbroken
cast
of
countenance
he
picks
up
the
watch
that
has
stuck
in
the
mud
the
other
man
who
is
little
with
pink
hair
and
white
eyes
goes
for
the
empty
case
and
says
win
then
the
elevated
pessimist
goes
down
under
his
leather
and
hands
a
handful
of
dollar
gold
pieces
to
his
albino
friend
i
do
know
how
much
money
it
was
it
looked
as
big
as
an
fund
to
me
have
this
here
case
filled
up
with
works
says
shorty
throw
you
again
for
five
hundred
your
company
says
the
high
man
meet
you
at
the
smoked
dog
saloon
an
hour
from
now
the
little
man
hustles
away
with
a
kind
of
swiss
movement
toward
a
jewelry
store
the
heartbroken
person
stoops
over
and
takes
a
telescopic
view
of
my
haberdashery
a
mighty
slick
outfit
of
habiliments
you
have
got
on
man
says
he
bet
a
hoss
you
never
acquired
the
right
title
and
interest
in
and
to
them
clothes
in
atascosa
city
no
says
i
being
ready
enough
to
exchange
personalities
with
this
moneyed
monument
of
melancholy
had
this
suit
tailored
from
a
special
line
of
coatericks
vestures
and
pantings
in
louis
would
you
mind
putting
me
sane
says
i
this
contest
i
been
used
to
seeing
treated
with
more
politeness
and
esteem
except
women
watches
of
course
which
by
nature
they
abuse
by
cracking
walnuts
with
and
having
taken
showing
in
tintype
pictures
and
george
he
explains
up
from
the
ranch
having
a
spell
of
fun
up
to
last
month
we
owned
four
sections
of
watered
grazing
down
on
the
san
miguel
but
along
comes
one
of
these
oil
prospectors
and
begins
to
bore
he
strikes
a
gusher
that
flows
out
twenty
thousand
or
maybe
it
was
twenty
million
barrels
of
oil
a
day
and
me
and
george
gets
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
thousand
dollars
apiece
for
the
land
so
now
and
then
we
saddles
up
and
hits
the
breeze
for
atascosa
city
for
a
few
days
of
excitement
and
damage
here
a
little
bunch
of
the
that
i
drawed
out
of
the
bank
this
morning
says
he
and
shows
a
roll
of
twenties
and
fifties
as
big
around
as
a
pillow
the
yellowbacks
glowed
like
a
sunset
on
the
gable
end
of
john
barn
my
knees
got
weak
and
i
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
board
sidewalk
must
have
knocked
around
a
right
smart
goes
on
this
oil
should
be
surprised
if
you
have
saw
towns
more
livelier
than
what
atascosa
city
is
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
that
there
ought
to
be
some
more
ways
of
having
a
good
time
than
there
is
here
when
you
got
plenty
of
money
and
do
mind
spending
it
then
this
mother
cary
chick
of
the
desert
sits
down
by
me
and
we
hold
a
conversationfest
it
seems
that
he
was
he
lived
in
ranch
camps
all
his
life
and
he
confessed
to
me
that
his
supreme
idea
of
luxury
was
to
ride
into
camp
tired
out
from
a
eat
a
peck
of
mexican
beans
hobble
his
brains
with
a
pint
of
raw
whisky
and
go
to
sleep
with
his
boots
for
a
pillow
when
this
of
unexpected
money
came
to
him
and
his
pink
but
perky
partner
george
and
they
hied
themselves
to
this
clump
of
outhouses
called
atascosa
city
you
know
what
happened
to
them
they
had
money
to
buy
anything
they
wanted
but
they
did
know
what
to
want
their
ideas
of
spendthriftiness
were
limited
to
three
whisky
saddles
and
gold
watches
if
there
was
anything
else
in
the
world
to
throw
away
fortunes
on
they
had
never
heard
about
it
so
when
they
wanted
to
have
a
hot
time
they
ride
into
town
and
get
a
city
directory
and
stand
in
front
of
the
principal
saloon
and
call
up
the
population
alphabetically
for
free
drinks
then
they
would
order
three
or
four
new
california
saddles
from
the
storekeeper
and
play
on
the
sidewalk
with
gold
pieces
betting
who
could
throw
his
gold
watch
the
farthest
was
an
inspiration
of
george
but
even
that
was
getting
to
be
monotonous
was
i
on
to
the
opportunity
listen
in
thirty
minutes
i
had
dashed
off
a
word
picture
of
metropolitan
joys
that
made
life
in
atascosa
city
look
as
dull
as
a
trip
to
coney
island
with
your
own
wife
in
ten
minutes
more
we
shook
hands
on
an
agreement
that
i
was
to
act
as
his
guide
interpreter
and
friend
in
and
to
the
aforesaid
wassail
and
amenity
and
solomon
mills
which
was
his
name
was
to
pay
all
expenses
for
a
month
at
the
end
of
that
time
if
i
had
made
good
as
of
the
rowdy
life
he
was
to
pay
me
one
thousand
dollars
and
then
to
clinch
the
bargain
we
called
the
roll
of
atascosa
city
and
put
all
of
its
citizens
except
the
ladies
and
minors
under
the
table
except
one
man
named
horace
westervelt
clair
just
for
that
we
bought
a
couple
of
hatfuls
of
cheap
silver
watches
and
egged
him
out
of
town
with
we
wound
up
by
dragging
the
out
of
bed
and
setting
him
to
work
on
three
new
saddles
and
then
we
went
to
sleep
across
the
railroad
track
at
the
depot
just
to
annoy
the
think
of
having
five
thousand
dollars
and
trying
to
avoid
the
disgrace
of
dying
rich
in
a
town
like
that
the
next
day
george
who
was
married
or
something
started
back
to
the
ranch
me
and
solly
as
i
now
called
him
prepared
to
shake
off
our
moth
balls
and
wing
our
way
against
the
of
the
joyous
and
tuneful
east
says
i
to
solly
long
enough
to
get
you
barbered
and
haberdashed
this
is
no
texas
feet
shampetter
says
i
you
eat
and
then
holler
whoopee
across
the
plaza
we
now
going
against
the
real
high
life
going
to
mingle
with
the
set
that
carries
a
spitz
wears
spats
and
hits
the
ground
in
high
spots
solly
puts
six
thousand
dollars
in
century
bills
in
one
pocket
of
his
brown
ducks
and
bills
of
lading
for
ten
thousand
dollars
on
eastern
banks
in
another
then
i
resume
diplomatic
relations
with
the
and
we
hike
in
a
northwesterly
direction
on
our
circuitous
route
to
the
spice
gardens
of
the
yankee
orient
we
stopped
in
san
antonio
long
enough
for
solly
to
buy
some
clothes
and
eight
rounds
of
drinks
for
the
guests
and
employees
of
the
menger
hotel
and
order
four
mexican
saddles
with
silver
trimmings
and
white
angora
to
be
shipped
down
to
the
ranch
from
there
we
made
a
big
jump
to
louis
we
got
there
in
time
for
dinner
and
i
put
our
on
the
register
of
the
most
expensive
hotel
in
the
city
says
i
to
solly
with
a
wink
at
myself
the
first
we
struck
where
we
can
get
a
real
good
plate
of
beans
and
while
he
was
up
in
his
room
trying
to
draw
water
out
of
the
i
got
one
finger
in
the
buttonhole
of
the
head
tuxedo
drew
him
apart
inserted
a
bill
and
closed
him
up
again
says
i
have
a
pal
here
for
dinner
that
been
subsisting
for
years
on
cereals
and
short
stogies
you
see
the
chef
and
order
a
dinner
for
us
such
as
you
serve
to
dave
francis
and
the
general
passenger
agent
of
the
iron
mountain
when
they
eat
here
got
more
than
bernhardt
tent
full
of
money
and
we
want
the
bags
crammed
with
all
the
chief
deveries
object
is
no
expense
now
show
us
at
six
me
and
solly
sat
down
to
dinner
spread
nothing
been
seen
like
it
since
the
cambon
snack
it
was
all
served
at
once
the
chef
called
it
a
la
it
a
famous
thing
among
the
gormands
of
the
west
the
dinner
comes
in
threes
of
a
kind
there
was
and
guinness
stout
roast
veal
mock
turtle
soup
and
chicken
pate
caviar
and
tapioca
duck
ham
and
rabbit
philadelphia
capon
fried
snails
and
and
so
on
in
threes
the
idea
was
that
you
eat
nearly
all
you
can
of
them
and
then
the
waiter
takes
away
the
discard
and
gives
you
pears
to
fill
on
i
was
sure
solly
would
be
tickled
to
death
with
these
hands
after
the
bobtail
flushes
he
been
eating
on
the
ranch
and
i
was
a
little
anxious
that
he
should
for
i
did
remember
his
having
honoured
my
efforts
with
a
smile
since
we
left
atascosa
city
we
were
in
the
main
and
there
was
a
crowd
there
all
talking
loud
and
enjoyable
about
the
two
louis
topics
the
water
supply
and
the
colour
line
they
mix
the
two
subjects
so
fast
that
strangers
often
think
they
are
discussing
and
that
has
given
the
old
town
something
of
a
rep
as
an
art
centre
and
over
in
the
corner
was
a
fine
brass
band
playing
and
now
thinks
i
solly
will
become
conscious
of
the
spiritual
oats
of
life
nourishing
and
exhilarating
his
system
but
mong
he
gazed
across
the
table
at
me
there
was
four
square
yards
of
it
looking
like
the
path
of
a
cyclone
that
has
wandered
through
a
yard
a
a
and
an
irish
linen
mill
solly
gets
up
and
comes
around
to
me
says
he
pretty
hungry
after
our
ride
i
thought
you
said
they
had
some
beans
here
i
going
out
and
get
something
i
can
eat
you
can
stay
and
monkey
with
this
artificial
layout
of
grub
if
you
want
to
a
minute
says
i
i
called
the
waiter
and
slapped
mills
on
the
back
of
the
check
for
thirteen
dollars
and
fifty
cents
do
you
mean
says
i
serving
gentlemen
with
a
lot
of
truck
only
suitable
for
on
a
mississippi
steamboat
we
going
out
to
get
something
decent
to
eat
i
walked
up
the
street
with
the
unhappy
plainsman
he
saw
a
shop
open
and
some
of
the
sadness
faded
from
his
eyes
we
went
in
and
he
ordered
and
paid
for
two
more
saddles
one
with
a
solid
silver
horn
and
nails
and
ornaments
and
a
border
of
rhinestones
and
imitation
rubies
around
the
flaps
the
other
one
had
to
have
a
mounted
horn
stirrups
and
the
leather
inlaid
with
silver
beadwork
wherever
it
would
stand
it
eleven
hundred
dollars
the
two
cost
him
then
he
goes
out
and
heads
toward
the
river
following
his
nose
in
a
little
side
street
where
there
was
no
street
and
no
sidewalks
and
no
houses
he
finds
what
he
is
looking
for
we
go
into
a
shanty
and
sit
on
high
stools
among
stevedores
and
boatmen
and
eat
beans
with
tin
spoons
yes
sir
beans
beans
boiled
with
salt
pork
kind
of
thought
we
strike
some
over
this
way
says
solly
says
i
stylish
hotel
grub
may
appeal
to
some
but
for
me
give
me
the
husky
when
we
had
succumbed
to
the
beans
i
leads
him
out
of
the
steam
under
a
lamp
post
and
pulls
out
a
daily
paper
with
the
amusement
column
folded
out
now
what
ho
for
a
merry
round
of
pleasure
says
i
one
of
hall
caine
shows
and
a
company
in
hamlet
and
skating
at
the
hollowhorn
rink
and
sarah
bernhardt
and
the
shapely
syrens
burlesque
company
i
should
think
now
that
the
shapely
but
what
does
this
healthy
wealthy
and
wise
man
do
but
reach
his
arms
up
to
the
windows
and
gape
noisily
i
be
going
to
bed
says
he
about
my
time
louis
is
a
kind
of
quiet
place
ai
it
yes
says
i
since
the
railroads
ran
in
here
the
been
practically
ruined
and
the
associations
and
the
fair
have
about
killed
it
guess
we
might
as
well
go
to
bed
wait
till
you
see
chicago
though
shall
we
get
tickets
for
the
big
breeze
as
well
says
solly
reckon
all
these
towns
are
about
alike
well
maybe
the
wise
cicerone
and
personal
conductor
did
fall
hard
in
chicago
is
supposed
to
have
one
or
two
things
in
it
calculated
to
keep
the
rural
visitor
awake
after
the
curfew
rings
but
not
for
the
man
of
the
pampas
i
tried
him
with
theatres
rides
in
automobiles
sails
on
the
lake
champagne
suppers
and
all
those
little
inventions
that
hold
the
simple
life
in
check
but
in
vain
solly
grew
sadder
day
by
day
and
i
got
fearful
about
my
salary
and
knew
i
must
play
my
trump
card
so
i
mentioned
new
york
to
him
and
informed
him
that
these
western
towns
were
no
more
than
gateways
to
the
great
walled
city
of
the
whirling
dervishes
after
i
bought
the
tickets
i
missed
solly
i
knew
his
habits
by
then
so
in
a
couple
of
hours
i
found
him
in
a
they
had
some
new
ideas
there
in
the
way
of
trees
and
girths
that
had
strayed
down
from
the
canadian
mounted
police
and
solly
was
so
interested
that
he
almost
looked
reconciled
to
live
he
invested
about
nine
hundred
dollars
in
there
at
the
depot
i
telegraphed
a
man
i
knew
in
new
york
to
meet
me
at
the
street
ferry
with
a
list
of
all
the
in
the
city
i
wanted
to
know
where
to
look
for
solly
when
he
got
lost
now
i
tell
you
what
happened
in
new
york
i
says
to
myself
heherezade
you
want
to
get
busy
and
make
bagdad
look
pretty
to
the
sad
sultan
of
the
sour
countenance
or
it
be
the
bowstring
for
yours
but
i
never
had
any
doubt
i
could
do
it
i
began
with
him
like
you
feed
a
starving
man
i
showed
him
the
on
broadway
and
the
staten
island
and
then
i
piled
up
the
sensations
on
him
but
always
keeping
a
lot
of
warmer
ones
up
my
sleeve
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
he
looked
like
a
composite
picture
of
five
thousand
orphans
too
late
to
catch
a
picnic
steamboat
and
i
was
wilting
down
a
collar
every
two
hours
wondering
how
i
could
please
him
and
whether
i
was
going
to
get
my
thou
he
went
to
sleep
looking
at
the
brooklyn
bridge
he
disregarded
the
above
the
third
story
it
took
three
ushers
to
wake
him
up
at
the
liveliest
vaudeville
in
town
once
i
thought
i
had
him
i
nailed
a
pair
of
cuffs
on
him
one
morning
before
he
was
awake
and
i
dragged
him
that
evening
to
the
of
one
of
the
biggest
hotels
in
the
city
to
see
the
johnnies
and
the
they
were
out
in
numerous
quantities
with
the
fat
of
the
land
showing
in
their
clothes
while
we
were
looking
them
over
solly
divested
himself
of
a
fearful
rusty
kind
of
laugh
like
moving
a
folding
bed
with
one
roller
broken
it
was
his
first
in
two
weeks
and
it
gave
me
hope
you
are
says
i
a
funny
lot
of
they
i
was
thinking
of
them
dudes
and
culls
on
the
hoof
says
he
was
thinking
of
the
time
me
and
george
put
in
horsehead
johnson
whisky
i
wish
i
was
back
in
atascosa
city
says
he
i
felt
a
cold
chill
run
down
my
back
to
play
and
mate
in
one
move
says
i
to
myself
i
made
solly
promise
to
stay
in
the
cafe
for
half
an
hour
and
i
hiked
out
in
a
cab
to
lolabelle
delatour
flat
on
street
i
knew
her
well
she
was
a
in
a
broadway
musical
comedy
says
i
when
i
found
her
got
a
friend
from
texas
here
he
all
right
but
well
he
carries
weight
i
like
to
give
him
a
little
whirl
after
the
show
this
evening
bubbles
you
know
and
a
buzz
out
to
a
casino
for
the
whitebait
and
pickled
walnuts
is
it
a
go
he
sing
asks
lolabelle
know
says
i
i
would
take
him
away
from
home
unless
his
notes
were
good
he
got
pots
of
money
full
of
it
him
around
after
the
second
act
says
lolabelle
examine
his
credentials
and
securities
so
about
ten
that
evening
i
led
solly
to
miss
and
her
maid
let
us
in
in
ten
minutes
in
comes
lolabelle
fresh
from
the
stage
looking
stunning
in
the
costume
she
wears
when
she
steps
from
the
ranks
of
the
lady
grenadiers
and
says
to
the
king
to
our
revels
and
you
can
bet
it
the
way
she
spoke
the
lines
that
got
her
the
part
as
soon
as
solly
saw
her
he
got
up
and
walked
straight
out
through
the
stage
entrance
into
the
street
i
followed
him
lolabelle
paying
my
salary
i
wondered
whether
anybody
was
says
solly
outside
was
an
awful
mistake
we
must
have
got
into
the
lady
private
room
i
hope
i
gentleman
enough
to
do
anything
possible
in
the
way
of
apologies
do
you
reckon
she
ever
forgive
us
may
forget
it
says
i
course
it
was
a
mistake
let
go
find
some
beans
that
the
way
it
went
but
pretty
soon
afterward
solly
failed
to
show
up
at
for
several
days
i
cornered
him
he
confessed
that
he
had
found
a
restaurant
on
third
avenue
where
they
cooked
beans
in
texas
style
i
made
him
take
me
there
the
minute
i
set
foot
inside
the
door
i
threw
up
my
hands
there
was
a
young
woman
at
the
desk
and
solly
introduced
me
to
her
and
then
we
sat
down
and
had
beans
yes
sir
sitting
at
the
desk
was
the
kind
of
a
young
woman
that
can
catch
any
man
in
the
world
as
easy
as
lifting
a
finger
there
a
way
of
doing
it
she
knew
i
saw
her
working
it
she
was
and
plain
dressed
she
had
her
hair
drawn
back
from
her
forehead
and
face
no
curls
or
frizzes
that
the
way
she
looked
now
i
tell
you
the
way
they
work
the
game
it
simple
when
she
wants
a
man
she
manages
it
so
that
every
time
he
looks
at
her
he
finds
her
looking
at
him
that
all
the
next
evening
solly
was
to
go
to
coney
island
with
me
at
seven
at
eight
he
had
showed
up
i
went
out
and
found
a
cab
i
felt
sure
there
was
something
wrong
to
the
back
home
restaurant
on
third
avenue
says
i
if
i
do
find
what
i
want
there
take
in
these
i
handed
him
the
list
says
the
cabby
et
a
steak
in
that
restaurant
once
if
you
real
hungry
i
advise
you
to
try
the
first
a
detective
says
i
i
do
eat
hurry
up
as
soon
as
i
got
to
the
restaurant
i
felt
in
the
lines
of
my
palms
that
i
should
beware
of
a
tall
red
damfool
man
and
i
was
going
to
lose
a
sum
of
money
solly
was
there
neither
was
the
lady
i
waited
and
in
an
hour
they
came
in
a
cab
and
got
out
hand
in
hand

across

agreed

she
says

irreligious
and
illegal
contract
and
she
wo

of
it
but
i
ai
going
to

says
he

at

if
you
are
knowing
in
the
chronicles
of
the
ring
you
will
recall
to
mind
an
event
in
the
early
when
for
a
minute
and
sundry
odd
seconds
a
champion
and
a
faced
each
other
on
the
alien
side
of
an
international
river
so
brief
a
conflict
had
rarely
imposed
upon
the
fair
promise
of
true
sport
the
reporters
made
what
they
could
of
it
but
divested
of
padding
the
action
was
sadly
fugacious
the
champion
merely
smote
his
victim
turned
his
back
upon
him
remarking
i
know
what
i
done
to
dat
stiff
and
extended
an
arm
like
a
ship
mast
for
his
glove
to
be
removed
which
accounts
for
a
trainload
of
extremely
disgusted
gentlemen
in
an
uproar
of
fancy
vests
and
being
spilled
from
their
pullmans
in
san
antonio
in
the
early
morning
following
the
fight
which
also
partly
accounts
for
the
unhappy
predicament
in
which
cricket
mcguire
found
himself
as
he
tumbled
from
his
car
and
sat
upon
the
depot
platform
torn
by
a
spasm
of
that
hollow
racking
cough
so
familiar
to
san
antonian
ears
at
that
time
in
the
uncertain
light
of
dawn
that
way
passed
curtis
raidler
the
nueces
county
cattleman
may
his
shadow
never
measure
under
six
foot
two
the
cattleman
out
this
early
to
catch
the
for
his
ranch
station
stopped
at
the
side
of
the
distressed
patron
of
sport
and
spoke
in
the
kindly
drawl
of
his
ilk
and
region
got
it
pretty
bad
bud
cricket
mcguire
prizefighter
tout
jockey
follower
of
the
ponies
sport
and
manipulator
of
the
gum
balls
and
walnut
shells
looked
up
pugnaciously
at
the
imputation
cast
by
bud
he
rasped
telegraph
pole
i
did
ring
for
yer
another
paroxysm
wrung
him
and
he
leaned
limply
against
a
convenient
baggage
truck
raidler
waited
patiently
glancing
around
at
the
white
hats
short
overcoats
and
big
cigars
thronging
the
platform
from
the
ai
you
bud
he
asked
when
the
other
was
partially
recovered
come
down
to
see
the
fight
fight
snapped
mcguire
was
a
hypodermic
injection
handed
him
just
one
like
a
squirt
of
dope
and
he
asleep
and
no
tanbark
needed
in
front
of
his
residence
fight
he
rattled
a
bit
coughed
and
went
on
hardly
addressing
the
cattleman
but
rather
for
the
relief
of
voicing
his
troubles
no
more
dead
sure
for
me
but
rus
sage
himself
would
have
snatched
at
it
five
to
one
dat
de
boy
from
cork
would
stay
rounds
is
what
i
invested
in
put
my
last
cent
on
and
could
already
smell
the
sawdust
in
dat
joint
of
jimmy
delaney
on
street
i
was
goin
to
buy
and
den
say
telegraph
pole
what
a
gazaboo
a
guy
is
to
put
his
whole
roll
on
one
turn
of
the
gaboozlum
you
plenty
right
said
the
big
cattleman
more
when
you
lose
son
you
get
up
and
light
out
for
a
hotel
you
got
a
mighty
bad
cough
had
it
long
lungs
said
mcguire
comprehensively
i
got
it
the
croaker
says
i
come
to
time
for
six
months
longer
maybe
a
year
if
i
hold
my
gait
i
wanted
to
settle
down
and
take
care
of
myself
dat
why
i
speculated
on
dat
five
to
one
perhaps
i
had
a
iron
dollars
saved
up
if
i
winned
i
was
goin
to
buy
delaney
cafe
who
a
dat
stiff
would
take
a
nap
in
de
foist
round
say
it
a
hard
deal
commented
raidler
looking
down
at
the
diminutive
form
of
mcguire
crumpled
against
the
truck
but
you
go
to
a
hotel
and
rest
there
the
menger
and
the
maverick
and
and
the
and
the
mimicked
mcguire
told
you
i
went
broke
i
on
de
bum
proper
i
got
one
dime
left
maybe
a
trip
to
europe
or
a
sail
in
me
private
yacht
would
fix
me
up
he
flung
his
dime
at
a
newsboy
got
his
propped
his
back
against
the
truck
and
was
at
once
rapt
in
the
account
of
his
waterloo
as
expanded
by
the
ingenious
press
curtis
raidler
interrogated
an
enormous
gold
watch
and
laid
his
hand
on
mcguire
shoulder
come
on
bud
he
said
we
got
three
minutes
to
catch
the
train
sarcasm
seemed
to
be
mcguire
vein
you
ai
seen
me
cash
in
any
chips
or
call
a
turn
since
i
told
you
i
was
broke
a
minute
ago
have
you
friend
chase
yourself
away
you
going
down
to
my
ranch
said
the
cattleman
and
stay
till
you
get
well
six
months
fix
you
good
as
new
he
lifted
mcguire
with
one
hand
and
him
in
the
direction
of
the
train
what
about
the
money
said
mcguire
struggling
weakly
to
escape
money
for
what
asked
raidler
puzzled
they
eyed
each
other
not
understanding
for
they
touched
only
as
at
the
gear
of
bevelled
wheels
at
right
angles
and
moving
upon
different
axes
passengers
on
the
saw
them
seated
together
and
wondered
at
the
conflux
of
two
such
antipodes
mcguire
was
five
feet
one
with
a
countenance
belonging
to
either
yokohama
or
dublin
of
eye
bony
of
cheek
and
jaw
scarred
toughened
broken
and
reknit
indestructible
grisly
gladiatorial
as
a
hornet
he
was
a
type
neither
new
nor
unfamiliar
raidler
was
the
product
of
a
different
soil
six
feet
two
in
height
miles
broad
and
no
deeper
than
a
crystal
brook
he
represented
the
union
of
the
west
and
south
few
accurate
pictures
of
his
kind
have
been
made
for
art
galleries
are
so
small
and
the
mutoscope
is
as
yet
unknown
in
texas
after
all
the
only
possible
medium
of
portrayal
of
raidler
kind
would
be
the
fresco
something
high
and
simple
and
cool
and
unframed
they
were
rolling
southward
on
the
international
the
timber
was
huddling
into
little
dense
green
motts
at
rare
distances
before
the
inundation
of
the
downright
vert
prairies
this
was
the
land
of
the
ranches
the
domain
of
the
kings
of
the
kine
mcguire
sat
collapsed
into
his
corner
of
the
seat
receiving
with
acid
suspicion
the
conversation
of
the
cattleman
what
was
the
game
of
this
big
geezer
who
was
carrying
him
off
altruism
would
have
been
mcguire
last
guess
he
ai
no
farmer
thought
the
captive
and
he
ai
no
con
man
for
sure
his
lay
you
trail
in
cricket
and
see
how
many
cards
he
draws
you
up
against
it
anyhow
you
got
a
nickel
and
gallopin
consumption
and
you
better
lay
low
lay
low
and
see
his
game
at
rincon
a
hundred
miles
from
san
antonio
they
left
the
train
for
a
buckboard
which
was
waiting
there
for
raidler
in
this
they
travelled
the
thirty
miles
between
the
station
and
their
destination
if
anything
could
this
drive
should
have
stirred
the
acrimonious
mcguire
to
a
sense
of
his
ransom
they
sped
upon
velvety
wheels
across
an
exhilarant
savanna
the
pair
of
spanish
ponies
struck
a
nimble
tireless
trot
which
gait
they
occasionally
relieved
by
a
wild
untrammelled
gallop
the
air
was
wine
and
seltzer
perfumed
as
they
absorbed
it
with
the
delicate
redolence
of
prairie
flowers
the
road
perished
and
the
buckboard
swam
the
uncharted
billows
of
the
grass
itself
steered
by
the
practised
hand
of
raidler
to
whom
each
tiny
distant
mott
of
trees
was
a
signboard
each
convolution
of
the
low
hills
a
voucher
of
course
and
distance
but
mcguire
reclined
upon
his
spine
seeing
nothing
but
a
desert
and
receiving
the
advances
with
sullen
distrust
he
up
to
was
the
burden
of
his
thoughts
kind
of
a
gold
brick
has
the
big
guy
got
to
sell
mcguire
was
only
applying
the
measure
of
the
streets
he
had
walked
to
a
range
bounded
by
the
horizon
and
the
fourth
dimension
a
week
before
while
riding
the
prairies
raidler
had
come
upon
a
sick
and
weakling
calf
deserted
and
bawling
without
dismounting
he
had
reached
and
slung
the
distressed
bossy
across
his
saddle
and
dropped
it
at
the
ranch
for
the
boys
to
attend
to
it
was
impossible
for
mcguire
to
know
or
comprehend
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
cattleman
his
case
and
that
of
the
calf
were
identical
in
interest
and
demand
upon
his
assistance
a
creature
was
ill
and
helpless
he
had
the
power
to
render
aid
these
were
the
only
postulates
required
for
the
cattleman
to
act
they
formed
his
system
of
logic
and
the
most
of
his
creed
mcguire
was
the
seventh
invalid
whom
raidler
had
picked
up
thus
casually
in
san
antonio
where
so
many
thousand
go
for
the
ozone
that
is
said
to
linger
about
its
contracted
streets
five
of
them
had
been
guests
of
solito
ranch
until
they
had
been
able
to
leave
cured
or
better
and
exhausting
the
vocabulary
of
tearful
gratitude
one
came
too
late
but
rested
very
comfortably
at
last
under
a
ratama
tree
in
the
garden
so
then
it
was
no
surprise
to
the
ranchhold
when
the
buckboard
spun
to
the
door
and
raidler
took
up
his
debile
like
a
handful
of
rags
and
set
him
down
upon
the
gallery
mcguire
looked
upon
things
strange
to
him
the
was
the
best
in
the
country
it
was
built
of
brick
hauled
one
hundred
miles
by
wagon
but
it
was
of
but
one
story
and
its
four
rooms
were
completely
encircled
by
a
mud
floor
gallery
the
miscellaneous
setting
of
horses
dogs
saddles
wagons
guns
and
paraphernalia
oppressed
the
metropolitan
eyes
of
the
wrecked
sportsman
well
here
we
are
at
home
said
raidler
cheeringly
it
a
h
l
of
a
looking
place
said
mcguire
promptly
as
he
rolled
upon
the
gallery
floor
in
a
fit
of
coughing
we
try
to
make
it
comfortable
for
you
buddy
said
the
cattleman
gently
it
ai
fine
inside
but
it
the
outdoors
anyway
do
you
the
most
good
this
be
your
room
in
here
anything
we
got
you
ask
for
it
he
led
mcguire
into
the
east
room
the
floor
was
bare
and
clean
white
curtains
waved
in
the
gulf
breeze
through
the
open
windows
a
big
willow
rocker
two
straight
chairs
a
long
table
covered
with
newspapers
pipes
tobacco
spurs
and
cartridges
stood
in
the
centre
some
heads
of
deer
and
one
of
an
enormous
black
javeli
projected
from
the
walls
a
wide
cool
stood
in
a
corner
nueces
county
people
regarded
this
guest
chamber
as
fit
for
a
prince
mcguire
showed
his
eyeteeth
at
it
he
took
out
his
nickel
and
spun
it
up
to
the
ceiling
i
was
lyin
about

if

the
cattleman
clear
grey
eyes
looked
steadily
from
under
his
grizzly
brows
into
the
huckleberry
optics
of
his
guest
after
a
little
he
said
simply
and
not
ungraciously
i
be
much
obliged
to
you
son
if
you
wo
mention

any
more
once

they
very
scarcely

in
half
an
hour
there
water
in
the
pitcher
and
some
cooler
to
drink
in
that
red
jar
hanging
on
the
gallery
where
the
bell
asked
mcguire
looking
about
bell
for
what
bell
to
ring
for
things
i
ca
see
here
he
exploded
in
a
sudden
weak
fury
i
never
asked
you
to
bring
me
here
i
never
held
you
up
for
a
cent
i
never
gave

miles
from

or

cocktail
i
sick
i
hustle
gee
but
i
up
against
it
mcguire
fell
upon
the
cot
and
sobbed
shiveringly
raidler
went
to
the
door
and
called
a
slender
mexican
youth
about
twenty
came
quickly
raidler
spoke
to
him
in
spanish
ylario
it
is
in
my
mind
that
i
promised
you
the
position
of
on
the
san
carlos
range
at
the
fall
such
was
your
goodness
listen
this
is
my
friend
he
is
very
sick
place
yourself
at
his
side
attend
to
his
wants
at
all
times
have
much
patience
and
care
with
him
and
when
he
is
well
or
and
when
he
is
well
instead
of
i
will
make
you
of
the
rancho
de
las
piedras
si
mil
gracias
ylario
tried
to
kneel
upon
the
floor
in
his
gratitude
but
the
cattleman
kicked
at
him
benevolently
growling
none
of
your
antics
now
ten
minutes
later
ylario
came
from
mcguire
room
and
stood
before
raidler
the
little
he
announced
presents
his
compliments
raidler
credited
ylario
with
the
preliminary
and
desires
some
pounded
ice
one
hot
bath
one
gin
that
the
windows
be
all
closed
toast
one
shave
one
newyorkheral
cigarettes
and
to
send
one
telegram
raidler
took
a
quart
bottle
of
whisky
from
his
medicine
cabinet
here
take
him
this
he
said
thus
was
instituted
the
reign
of
terror
at
the
solito
ranch
for
a
few
weeks
mcguire
blustered
and
boasted
and
swaggered
before
the
punchers
who
rode
in
for
miles
around
to
see
this
latest
importation
of
raidler
he
was
an
absolutely
new
experience
to
them
he
explained
to
them
all
the
intricate
points
of
sparring
and
the
tricks
of
training
and
defence
he
opened
to
their
minds
view
all
the
indecorous
life
of
a
tagger
after
professional
sports
his
jargon
of
slang
was
a
continuous
joy
and
surprise
to
them
his
gestures
his
strange
poses
his
frank
ribaldry
of
tongue
and
principle
fascinated
them
he
was
like
a
being
from
a
new
world
strange
to
say
this
new
world
he
had
entered
did
not
exist
to
him
he
was
an
utter
egoist
of
bricks
and
mortar
he
had
dropped
out
he
felt
into
open
space
for
a
time
and
all
it
contained
was
an
audience
for
his
reminiscences
neither
the
limitless
freedom
of
the
prairie
days
nor
the
grand
hush
of
the
spangled
nights
touched
him
all
the
hues
of
aurora
could
not
win
him
from
the
pink
pages
of
a
sporting
journal
get
something
for
nothing
was
his
mission
in
life
street
was
his
goal
nearly
two
months
after
his
arrival
he
began
to
complain
that
he
felt
worse
it
was
then
that
he
became
the
ranch
incubus
its
harpy
its
old
man
of
the
sea
he
shut
himself
in
his
room
like
some
venomous
kobold
or
flibbertigibbet
whining
complaining
cursing
accusing
the
keynote
of
his
plaint
was
that
he
had
been
inveigled
into
a
gehenna
against
his
will
that
he
was
dying
of
neglect
and
lack
of
comforts
with
all
his
dire
protestations
of
increasing
illness
to
the
eye
of
others
he
remained
unchanged
his
eyes
were
as
bright
and
diabolic
as
ever
his
voice
was
as
rasping
his
callous
face
with
the
skin
drawn
tense
as
a
had
no
flesh
to
lose
a
flush
on
his
prominent
cheek
bones
each
afternoon
hinted
that
a
clinical
thermometer
might
have
revealed
a
symptom
and
percussion
might
have
established
the
fact
that
mcguire
was
breathing
with
only
one
lung
but
his
appearance
remained
the
same
in
constant
attendance
upon
him
was
ylario
whom
the
coming
reward
of
the
must
have
greatly
stimulated
for
mcguire
chained
him
to
a
bitter
existence
the
air
the
man
only
chance
for
life
he
commanded
to
be
kept
out
by
closed
windows
and
drawn
curtains
the
room
was
always
blue
and
foul
with
cigarette
smoke
whosoever
entered
it
must
sit
suffocating
and
listen
to
the
imp
interminable
gasconade
concerning
his
scandalous
career
the
oddest
thing
of
all
was
the
relation
existing
between
mcguire
and
his
benefactor
the
attitude
of
the
invalid
toward
the
cattleman
was
something
like
that
of
a
peevish
perverse
child
toward
an
indulgent
parent
when
raidler
would
leave
the
ranch
mcguire
would
fall
into
a
fit
of
malevolent
silent
sullenness
when
he
returned
he
would
be
met
by
a
string
of
violent
and
stinging
reproaches
raidler
attitude
toward
his
charge
was
quite
inexplicable
in
its
way
the
cattleman
seemed
actually
to
assume
and
feel
the
character
assigned
to
him
by
mcguire
intemperate
accusations
the
character
of
tyrant
and
guilty
oppressor
he
seemed
to
have
adopted
the
responsibility
of
the
fellow
condition
and
he
always
met
his
tirades
with
a
pacific
patient
and
even
remorseful
kindness
that
never
altered
one
day
raidler
said
to
him
try
more
air
son
you
can
have
the
buckboard
and
a
driver
every
day
if
you
go
try
a
week
or
two
in
one
of
the
cow
camps
i
fix
you
up
plumb
comfortable
the
ground
and
the
air
next
to
it
them
the
things
to
cure
you
i
knowed
a
man
from
philadelphy
sicker
than
you
are
got
lost
on
the
guadalupe
and
slept
on
the
bare
grass
in
sheep
camps
for
two
weeks
well
sir
it
started
him
getting
well
which
he
done
close
to
the
ground
where
the
medicine
in
the
air
stays
try
a
little
hossback
riding
now
there
a
gentle
pony
what
i
done
to
yer
screamed
mcguire
did
i
ever
doublecross
yer
did
i
ask
you
to
bring
me
here

me
out
to
your
camps
if
you
wanter
or
stick
a
knife
in
me
and
save
trouble
ride
i
ca
lift
my
feet
i
could
sidestep
a
jab
from
a
kid
that
what
your
d
d
ranch
has
done
for
me
there
nothing
to
eat
nothing
to
see
and
nobody
to
talk
to
but
a
lot
of
reubens
who
do
know
a
punching
bag
from
a
lobster
salad
it
a
lonesome
place
for
certain
apologised
raidler
abashedly
we
got
plenty
but
it
rough
enough
anything
you
think
of
you
want
the
boys
ride
up
and
fetch
it
down
for
you
it
was
chad
murchison
a
from
the
circle
bar
outfit
who
first
suggested
that
mcguire
illness
was
fraudulent
chad
had
brought
a
basket
of
grapes
for
him
thirty
miles
and
four
out
of
his
way
tied
to
his
after
remaining
in
the
room
for
a
while
he
emerged
and
bluntly
confided
his
suspicions
to
raidler
his
arm
said
chad
is
a
diamond
he
interduced
me
to
what
he
called
a
punch
and
was
like
being
kicked
twice
by
a
mustang
he
playin
it
low
down
on
you
curt
he
ai
no
i
am
i
hate
to
say
it
but
the
runt
workin
you
for
range
and
shelter
the
cattleman
ingenuous
mind
refused
to
entertain
chad
view
of
the
case
and
when
later
he
came
to
apply
the
test
doubt
entered
not
into
his
motives
one
day
about
noon
two
men
drove
up
to
the
ranch
alighted
hitched
and
came
in
to
dinner
standing
and
general
invitations
being
the
custom
of
the
country
one
of
them
was
a
great
san
antonio
doctor
whose
costly
services
had
been
engaged
by
a
wealthy
cowman
who
had
been
laid
low
by
an
accidental
bullet
he
was
now
being
driven
back
to
the
station
to
take
the
train
back
to
town
after
dinner
raidler
took
him
aside
pushed
a
bill
against
his
hand
and
said
doc
there
a
young
chap
in
that
room
i
guess
has
got
a
bad
case
of
consumption
i
like
for
you
to
look
him
over
and
see
just
how
bad
he
is
and
if
we
can
do
anything
for
him
how
much
was
that
dinner
i
just
ate
mr
raidler
said
the
doctor
bluffly
looking
over
his
spectacles
raidler
returned
the
money
to
his
pocket
the
doctor
immediately
entered
mcguire
room
and
the
cattleman
seated
himself
upon
a
heap
of
saddles
on
the
gallery
ready
to
reproach
himself
in
the
event
the
verdict
should
be
unfavourable
in
ten
minutes
the
doctor
came
briskly
out
your
man
he
said
promptly
is
as
sound
as
a
new
dollar
his
lungs
are
better
than
mine
respiration
temperature
and
pulse
normal
chest
expansion
four
inches
not
a
sign
of
weakness
anywhere
of
course
i
did
examine
for
the
bacillus
but
it
is
there
you
can
put
my
name
to
the
diagnosis
even
cigarettes
and
a
vilely
close
room
have
hurt
him
coughs
does
he
well
you
tell
him
it
is
necessary
you
asked
if
there
is
anything
we
could
do
for
him
well
i
advise
you
to
set
him
digging
or
breaking
mustangs
there
our
team
ready
day
sir
and
like
a
puff
of
wholesome
blustery
wind
the
doctor
was
off
raidler
reached
out
and
plucked
a
leaf
from
a
mesquite
bush
by
the
railing
and
began
chewing
it
thoughtfully
the
branding
season
was
at
hand
and
the
next
morning
ross
hargis
foreman
of
the
outfit
was
mustering
his
force
of
some
men
at
the
ranch
ready
to
start
for
the
san
carlos
range
where
the
work
was
to
begin
by
six
the
horses
were
all
saddled
the
grub
wagon
ready
and
the
were
swinging
themselves
upon
their
mounts
when
raidler
bade
them
wait
a
boy
was
bringing
up
an
extra
pony
bridled
and
saddled
to
the
gate
raidler
walked
to
room
and
threw
open
the
door
mcguire
was
lying
on
his
cot
not
yet
dressed
smoking
get
up
said
the
cattleman
and
his
voice
was
clear
and
brassy
like
a
bugle
how
that
asked
mcguire
a
little
startled
get
up
and
dress
i
can
stand
a
rattlesnake
but
i
hate
a
liar
do
i
have
to
tell
you
again
he
caught
mcguire
by
the
neck
and
stood
him
on
the
floor
say
friend
cried
mcguire
wildly
are
you
i
sick
see
i
croak
if
i
got
to
hustle
what
i
done
to
yer
he
began
his
chronic
whine
i
never
asked
yer
to
put
on
your
clothes
called
raidler
in
a
rising
tone
swearing
stumbling
shivering
keeping
his
amazed
shining
eyes
upon
the
now
menacing
form
of
the
aroused
cattleman
mcguire
managed
to
tumble
into
his
clothes
then
raidler
took
him
by
the
collar
and
shoved
him
out
and
across
the
yard
to
the
extra
pony
hitched
at
the
gate
the
lolled
in
their
saddles
take
this
man
said
raidler
to
ross
hargis
and
put
him
to
work
make
him
work
hard
sleep
hard
and
eat
hard
you
boys
know
i

what
i
could
for

and
he
was
welcome
yesterday
the
best
doctor
in
san
antone
examined
him
and
says
he
got
the
lungs
of
a
burro
and
the
constitution
of
a
steer
you
know
what
to
do
with
him
ross
ross
hargis
only
smiled
grimly
aw
said
mcguire
looking
intently
at
raidler
with
a
peculiar
expression
upon
his
face
the
croaker
said
i
was
all

he
said

the
croaker
says

for

here
where
you
play
even
he
sprang
into
the
saddle
easily
as
a
bird
got
the
quirt
from
the
horn
and
gave
his
pony
a
slash
with
it
cricket
who
once
brought
in
good
boy
by
a
neck
at
hawthorne
and
a
to
shot
had
his
foot
in
the
stirrups
again
mcguire
led
the
cavalcade
as
they
dashed
away
for
san
carlos
and
the
gave
a
yell
of
applause
as
they
closed
in
behind
his
dust
but
in
less
than
a
mile
he
had
lagged
to
the
rear
and
was
last
man
when
they
struck
the
patch
of
high
chaparral
below
the
horse
pens
behind
a
clump
of
this
he
drew
rein
and
held
a
handkerchief
to
his
mouth
he
took
it
away
drenched
with
bright
arterial
blood
and
threw
it
carefully
into
a
clump
of
prickly
pear
then
he
slashed
with
his
quirt
again
gasped
to
his
astonished
pony
and
galloped
after
the
gang
that
night
raidler
received
a
message
from
his
old
home
in
alabama
there
had
been
a
death
in
the
family
an
estate
was
to
divide
and
they
called
for
him
to
come
daylight
found
him
in
the
buckboard
skimming
the
prairies
for
the
station
it
was
two
months
before
he
returned
when
he
arrived
at
the
ranch
house
he
found
it
deserted
save
for
ylario
who
acted
as
a
kind
of
steward
during
his
absence
little
by
little
the
youth
made
him
acquainted
with
the
work
done
while
he
was
away
the
branding
camp
he
was
informed
was
still
doing
business
on
account
of
many
severe
storms
the
cattle
had
been
badly
scattered
and
the
branding
had
been
accomplished
but
slowly
the
camp
was
now
in
the
valley
of
the
guadalupe
twenty
miles
away
by
the
way
said
raidler
suddenly
remembering
that
fellow
i
sent
along
with
them
mcguire
is
he
working
yet
i
do
not
know
said
ylario
mans
from
the
camp
come
verree
few
times
to
the
ranch
so
plentee
work
with
the
leetle
calves
they
no
say
oh
i
think
that
fellow
mcguire
he
dead
much
time
ago
dead
said
raidler
what
you
talking
about
verree
sick
fellow
mcguire
replied
ylario
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulder
i
theenk
he
no
live
one
two
month
when
he
go
away
shucks
said
raidler
he
humbugged
you
too
did
he
the
doctor
examined
him
and
said
he
was
sound
as
a
mesquite
knot
that
doctor
said
ylario
smiling
he
tell
you
so
that
doctor
no
see
mcguire
talk
up
ordered
raidler
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
mcguire
continued
the
boy
tranquilly
he
getting
drink
water
outside
when
that
doctor
come
in
room
that
doctor
take
me
and
pound
me
all
over
here
with
his
fingers
putting
his
hand
to
his
chest
i
not
know
for
what
he
put
his
ear
here
and
here
and
here
and
listen
i
not
know
for
what
he
put
little
glass
stick
in
my
mouth
he
feel
my
arm
here
he
make
me
count
like
whisper
so
twenty
who
knows
concluded
ylario
with
a
deprecating
spread
of
his
hands
for
what
that
doctor
do
those
verree
droll
and
things
what
horses
are
up
asked
raidler
shortly
paisano
is
grazing
out
behind
the
little
corral
saddle
him
for
me
at
once
within
a
very
few
minutes
the
cattleman
was
mounted
and
away
paisano
well
named
after
that
ungainly
but
bird
struck
into
his
long
lope
that
ate
up
the
ground
like
a
strip
of
macaroni
in
two
hours
and
a
quarter
raidler
from
a
gentle
swell
saw
the
branding
camp
by
a
water
hole
in
the
guadalupe
sick
with
expectancy
of
the
news
he
feared
he
rode
up
dismounted
and
dropped
paisano
reins
so
gentle
was
his
heart
that
at
that
moment
he
would
have
pleaded
guilty
to
the
murder
of
mcguire
the
only
being
in
the
camp
was
the
cook
who
was
just
arranging
the
hunks
of
barbecued
beef
and
distributing
the
tin
coffee
cups
for
supper
raidler
evaded
a
direct
question
concerning
the
one
subject
in
his
mind
everything
all
right
in
camp
pete
he
managed
to
inquire
so
so
said
pete
conservatively
grub
give
out
twice
wind
scattered
the
cattle
and
we
had
to
rake
the
brush
for
forty
mile
i
need
a
new
and
the
mosquitos
is
some
more
hellish
than
common
the
boys
all
well
pete
was
no
optimist
besides
inquiries
concerning
the
health
of
punchers
were
not
only
superfluous
but
bordered
on
flaccidity
it
was
not
like
the
boss
to
make
them
what
left
of
do
miss
no
calls
to
grub
the
cook
conceded
what
left
of
repeated
raidler
in
a
husky
voice
mechanically
he
began
to
look
around
for
mcguire
grave
he
had
in
his
mind
a
white
slab
such
as
he
had
seen
in
the
alabama
but
immediately
he
knew
that
was
foolish
sure
said
pete
what
left
cow
camps
change
in
two
months
some
gone
raidler
nerved
himself
that
chap
i
sent
along
mcguire
did
he
say
interrupted
pete
rising
with
a
chunk
of
corn
bread
in
each
hand
that
was
a
dirty
shame
sending
that
poor
sick
kid
to
a
cow
camp
a
doctor
that
could
tell
he
was
graveyard
meat
ought
to
be
skinned
with
a
cinch
buckle
game
as
he
was
too
it
a
scandal
among
snakes
lem
me
tell
you
what
he
done
first
night
in
camp
the
boys
started
to
initiate
him
in
the
leather
breeches
degree
ross
hargis
busted
him
one
swipe
with
his
chaparreras
and
what
do
you
reckon
the
poor
child
did
got
up
the
little
skeeter
and
licked
ross
licked
ross
hargis
licked
him
good
hit
him
plenty
and
everywhere
and
hard
ross
just
get
up
and
pick
out
a
fresh
place
to
lay
down
on
agin
then
that
mcguire
goes
off
there
and
lays
down
with
his
head
in
the
grass
and
bleeds
a
they
calls
it
he
lays
there
eighteen
hours
by
the
watch
and
they
ca
budge
him
then
ross
hargis
who
loves
any
man
who
can
lick
him
goes
to
work
and
damns
the
doctors
from
greenland
to
poland

viii
an
afternoon
miracle
at
the
united
states
end
of
an
international
river
bridge
four
armed
rangers
sweltered
in
a
little
hut
keeping
a
fairly
faithful
espionage
upon
the
lagging
trail
of
passengers
from
the
mexican
side
bud
dawson
proprietor
of
the
top
notch
saloon
had
on
the
evening
previous
violently
ejected
from
his
premises
one
leandro
garcia
for
alleged
violation
of
the
top
notch
code
of
behaviour
garcia
had
mentioned
hours
as
a
limit
by
which
time
he
would
call
and
collect
a
painful
indemnity
for
personal
satisfaction
this
mexican
although
a
tremendous
braggart
was
thoroughly
courageous
and
each
side
of
the
river
respected
him
for
one
of
these
attributes
he
and
a
following
of
similar
bravoes
were
addicted
to
the
pastime
of
retrieving
towns
from
stagnation
the
day
designated
by
garcia
for
retribution
was
to
be
further
signalised
on
the
american
side
by
a
cattlemen
convention
a
bull
fight
and
an
old
settlers
barbecue
and
picnic
knowing
the
avenger
to
be
a
man
of
his
word
and
believing
it
prudent
to
court
peace
while
three
such
gently
social
relaxations
were
in
progress
captain
mcnulty
of
the
ranger
company
stationed
there
detailed
his
lieutenant
and
three
men
for
duty
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
their
instructions
were
to
prevent
the
invasion
of
garcia
either
alone
or
attended
by
his
gang
travel
was
slight
that
sultry
afternoon
and
the
rangers
swore
gently
and
mopped
their
brows
in
their
convenient
but
close
quarters
for
an
hour
no
one
had
crossed
save
an
old
woman
enveloped
in
a
brown
wrapper
and
a
black
mantilla
driving
before
her
a
burro
loaded
with
kindling
wood
tied
in
small
bundles
for
peddling
then
three
shots
were
fired
down
the
street
the
sound
coming
clear
and
snappy
through
the
still
air
the
four
rangers
quickened
from
sprawling
symbolic
figures
of
indolence
to
alert
life
but
only
one
rose
to
his
feet
three
turned
their
eyes
beseechingly
but
hopelessly
upon
the
fourth
who
had
gotten
nimbly
up
and
was
buckling
his
around
him
the
three
knew
that
lieutenant
bob
buckley
in
command
would
allow
no
man
of
them
the
privilege
of
investigating
a
row
when
he
himself
might
go
the
agile
lieutenant
without
a
change
of
expression
in
his
smooth
melancholy
face
shot
the
belt
strap
through
the
guard
of
the
buckle
hefted
his
sixes
in
their
holsters
as
a
belle
gives
the
finishing
touches
to
her
toilette
caught
up
his
winchester
and
dived
for
the
door
there
he
paused
long
enough
to
caution
his
comrades
to
maintain
their
watch
upon
the
bridge
and
then
plunged
into
the
broiling
highway
the
three
relapsed
into
resigned
inertia
and
plaintive
comment
i
heard
of
fellows
grumbled
broncho
leathers
what
was
wedded
to
danger
but
if
bob
buckley
ai
committed
bigamy
with
trouble
a
son
of
a
gun
peculiarness
of
bob
is
inserted
the
nueces
kid
he
ai
had
proper
trainin
he
never
learned
how
to
git
skeered
now
a
man
ought
to
be
skeered
enough
when
he
tackles
a
fuss
to
hanker
after
his
name
on
the
list
of
survivors
anyway
buckley
commented
ranger
no
who
was
a
misguided
eastern
man
burdened
with
an
education
scraps
in
such
a
solemn
manner
that
i
have
been
led
to
doubt
its
spontaneity
i
not
quite
onto
his
system
but
he
fights
like
tybalt
by
the
book
of
arithmetic
i
never
heard
mentioned
broncho
about
any
of
dibble
ways
of
mixin
scrappin
and
cipherin
triggernometry
suggested
the
nueces
infant
that
rather
better
than
i
hoped
from
you
nodded
the
easterner
approvingly
the
other
meaning
is
that
buckley
never
goes
into
a
fight
without
giving
away
weight
he
seems
to
dread
taking
the
slightest
advantage
that
quite
close
to
foolhardiness
when
you
are
dealing
with
and
who
would
ambush
you
any
night
and
shoot
you
in
the
back
if
they
could
buckley
too
full
of
sand
he
play
horatius
and
hold
the
bridge
once
too
often
some
day
i
on
there
drawled
the
kid
i
mind
that
bridge
gang
in
the
reader
me
i
go
instructed
for
the
other
chap
spurious
somebody
the
one
that
fought
and
pulled
his
freight
to
fight
on
some
other
day
anyway
summed
up
broncho
bob
about
the
gamest
man
i
ever
see
along
the
rio
bravo
great
sam
houston
if
she
gets
any
hotter
sizzle
broncho
whacked
at
a
scorpion
with
his
stetson
felt
and
the
three
watchers
relapsed
into
comfortless
silence
how
well
bob
buckley
had
kept
his
secret
since
these
men
for
two
years
his
side
comrades
in
countless
border
raids
and
dangers
thus
spake
of
him
not
knowing
that
he
was
the
most
arrant
physical
coward
in
all
that
rio
bravo
country
neither
his
friends
nor
his
enemies
had
suspected
him
of
aught
else
than
the
finest
courage
it
was
purely
a
physical
cowardice
and
only
by
an
extreme
grim
effort
of
will
had
he
forced
his
craven
body
to
do
the
bravest
deeds
scourging
himself
always
as
a
monk
whips
his
besetting
sin
buckley
threw
himself
with
apparent
recklessness
into
every
danger
with
the
hope
of
some
day
ridding
himself
of
the
despised
affliction
but
each
successive
test
brought
no
relief
and
the
ranger
face
by
nature
adapted
to
cheerfulness
and
became
set
to
the
guise
of
gloomy
melancholy
thus
while
the
frontier
admired
his
deeds
and
his
prowess
was
celebrated
in
print
and
by
word
of
mouth
in
many
fires
in
the
valley
of
the
bravo
his
heart
was
sick
within
him
only
himself
knew
of
the
horrible
tightening
of
the
chest
the
dry
mouth
the
weakening
of
the
spine
the
agony
of
the
strung
nerves
the
failing
symptoms
of
his
shameful
malady
one
mere
boy
in
his
company
was
wont
to
enter
a
fray
with
a
leg
perched
flippantly
about
the
horn
of
his
saddle
a
cigarette
hanging
from
his
lips
which
emitted
smoke
and
original
slogans
of
clever
invention
buckley
would
have
given
a
year
pay
to
attain
that
method
once
the
debonair
youth
said
to
him
buck
you
go
into
a
scrap
like
it
was
a
funeral
not
he
added
with
a
complimentary
wave
of
his
tin
cup
but
what
it
generally
is
buckley
conscience
was
of
the
new
england
order
with
western
adjustments
and
he
continued
to
get
his
rebellious
body
into
as
many
difficulties
as
possible
wherefore
on
that
sultry
afternoon
he
chose
to
drive
his
own
protesting
limbs
to
investigation
of
that
sudden
alarm
that
had
startled
the
peace
and
dignity
of
the
state
two
squares
down
the
street
stood
the
top
notch
saloon
here
buckley
came
upon
signs
of
recent
upheaval
a
few
curious
spectators
pressed
about
its
front
entrance
grinding
beneath
their
heels
the
fragments
of
a
window
inside
buckley
found
bud
dawson
utterly
ignoring
a
bullet
wound
in
his
shoulder
while
he
feelingly
wept
at
having
to
explain
why
he
failed
to
drop
the
blamed
masquerooter
who
shot
him
at
the
entrance
of
the
ranger
bud
turned
appealingly
to
him
for
confirmation
of
the
devastation
he
might
have
dealt
you
know
buck
i
plum
got
him
first
rattle
if
i
thought
a
minute
come
in
playin
female
till
he
got
the
drop
and
turned
loose
i
never
reached
for
a
gun
thinkin
it
was
sure
chihuahua
betty
or
atwater
or
anyhow
one
of
the
mayfield
girls
comin
which
they
might
liable
as
not
i
never
thought
of
that
blamed
garcia
until
garcia
snapped
buckley
how
did
he
get
over
here
bud
bartender
took
the
ranger
by
the
arm
and
led
him
to
the
side
door
there
stood
a
patient
grey
burro
cropping
the
grass
along
the
gutter
with
a
load
of
kindling
wood
tied
across
its
back
on
the
ground
lay
a
black
shawl
and
a
voluminous
brown
dress
masquerootin
in
them
things
called
bud
still
resisting
attempted
ministrations
to
his
wounds
thought
he
was
a
lady
till
he
gave
a
yell
and
winged
me
he
went
down
this
side
street
said
the
bartender
he
was
alone
and
he
hide
out
till
night
when
his
gang
comes
over
you
ought
to
find
him
in
that
mexican
below
the
depot
he
got
a
girl
down
there
pancha
sales
how
was
he
armed
asked
buckley
two
sixes
and
a
knife
keep
this
for
me
billy
said
the
ranger
handing
over
his
winchester
quixotic
perhaps
but
it
was
bob
buckley
way
another
man
and
a
braver
one
might
have
raised
a
posse
to
accompany
him
it
was
buckley
rule
to
discard
all
preliminary
advantage
the
mexican
had
left
behind
him
a
wake
of
closed
doors
and
an
empty
street
but
now
people
were
beginning
to
emerge
from
their
places
of
refuge
with
assumed
unconsciousness
of
anything
having
happened
many
citizens
who
knew
the
ranger
pointed
out
to
him
with
alacrity
the
course
of
garcia
retreat
as
buckley
swung
along
upon
the
trail
he
felt
the
beginning
of
the
suffocating
constriction
about
his
throat
the
cold
sweat
under
the
brim
of
his
hat
the
old
shameful
dreaded
sinking
of
his
heart
as
it
went
down
down
down
in
his
bosom
the
morning
train
of
the
mexican
central
had
that
day
been
three
hours
late
thus
failing
to
connect
with
the
i
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
passengers
for
estados
grumblingly
sought
entertainment
in
the
little
swaggering
mongrel
town
of
two
nations
for
until
the
morrow
no
other
train
would
come
to
rescue
them
grumblingly
because
two
days
later
would
begin
the
great
fair
and
races
in
san
antone
consider
that
at
that
time
san
antone
was
the
hub
of
the
wheel
of
fortune
and
the
names
of
its
spokes
were
cattle
wool
faro
running
horses
and
ozone
in
those
times
cattlemen
played
at
on
the
sidewalks
with
and
gentlemen
backed
their
conception
of
the
fortuitous
card
with
stacks
limited
in
height
only
by
the
interference
of
gravity
wherefore
thither
journeyed
the
sowers
and
the
reapers
they
who
stampeded
the
dollars
and
they
who
rounded
them
up
especially
did
the
caterers
to
the
amusement
of
the
people
haste
to
san
antone
two
greatest
shows
on
earth
were
already
there
and
dozens
of
smallest
ones
were
on
the
way
on
a
side
track
near
the
mean
little
depot
stood
a
private
car
left
there
by
the
mexican
train
that
morning
and
doomed
by
an
ineffectual
schedule
to
ignobly
await
amid
squalid
surroundings
connection
with
the
next
day
regular
the
car
had
been
once
a
common
but
those
who
had
sat
in
it
and
gringed
to
the
conductor
slips
would
never
have
recognised
it
in
its
transformation
paint
and
gilding
and
certain
domestic
touches
had
liberated
it
from
any
suspicion
of
public
servitude
the
whitest
of
lace
curtains
judiciously
screened
its
windows
from
its
fore
end
drooped
in
the
torrid
air
the
flag
of
mexico
from
its
rear
projected
the
stars
and
stripes
and
a
busy
stovepipe
the
latter
reinforcing
in
its
suggestion
of
culinary
comforts
the
general
suggestion
of
privacy
and
ease
the
eye
regarding
its
gorgeous
sides
found
interest
to
culminate
in
a
single
name
in
gold
and
blue
letters
extending
almost
its
entire
length
a
single
name
the
audacious
privilege
of
royalty
and
genius
doubly
then
was
this
arrogant
nomenclature
here
justified
for
the
name
was
that
of
alvarita
queen
of
the
serpent
tribe
this
her
car
was
back
from
a
triumphant
tour
of
the
principal
mexican
cities
and
now
headed
for
san
antonio
where
according
to
promissory
advertisement
she
would
exhibit
her
marvellous
dominion
and
fearless
control
over
deadly
and
venomous
serpents
handling
them
with
ease
as
they
coil
and
hiss
to
the
terror
of
thousands
of
tremblers
one
hundred
in
the
shade
kept
the
vicinity
somewhat
depeopled
this
quarter
of
the
town
was
a
ragged
edge
its
denizens
the
bubbling
froth
of
five
nations
its
architecture
tent
and
its
distractions
the
and
the
informal
contribution
to
the
sudden
stranger
store
of
experience
beyond
this
dishonourable
fringe
upon
the
old
town
jowl
rose
a
dense
mass
of
trees
surmounting
and
filling
a
little
hollow
through
this
bickered
a
small
stream
that
perished
down
the
sheer
and
disconcerting
side
of
the
great
canon
of
the
rio
bravo
del
norte
in
this
sordid
spot
was
condemned
to
remain
for
certain
hours
the
impotent
transport
of
the
queen
of
the
serpent
tribe
the
front
door
of
the
car
was
open
its
forward
end
was
curtained
off
into
a
small
here
the
admiring
and
propitiatory
reporters
were
wont
to
sit
and
transpose
the
music
of
senorita
alvarita
talk
into
the
more
florid
key
of
the
press
a
picture
of

of

alvarita
spanish
you
would
say
andalusian

long
dusky
and
disquieting
with
their
untroubled

haughty

with

insolence

gave
it
life
to

charm
but
glance
at
the
stacks
of
handbills
in
the
corner
green
and
yellow
and
white
upon
them
you
see
an
incompetent
presentment
of
the
senorita

her
professional
garb

black
lace
and
yellow
ribbons

a

drew
aside
the

any

guess

find
him
there
all
right
a
few
minutes
later
alvarita
stopped
upon
the
forward
platform
ready
for
her
quest
her
handsome
black
skirt
was
shaped
to
the
most
recent
proclamation
of
fashion
her
spotless
gladdened
the
eye
in
that
desert
of
sunshine
a
swelling
oasis
cool
and
fresh
a
hat
sat
firmly
on
her
coiled
abundant
hair
beneath
her
serene
round
impudent
chin
a
man
tie
was
jauntily
knotted
about
a
man
high
stiff
collar
a
parasol
she
carried
of
white
silk
and
its
fringe
was
lace
yellowly
genuine
i
will
grant
gallipolis
as
to
her
costume
but
firmly
to
seville
or
valladolid
i
am
held
by
her
eyes
castanets
balconies
mantillas
serenades
ambuscades
escapades
all
these
their
dark
depths
guaranteed
ai
you
afraid
to
go
out
alone
alviry
queried
the
anxiously
there
so
many
rough
people
about

i
never

i
was
afraid
of

ma
people
and
men
in

do
you
fret
i
trot
along
back
as
soon
as
i
find
that
runaway
scamp
the
dust
lay
thick
upon
the
bare
ground
near
the
tracks
eye
soon
discovered
the
serrated
trail
of
the
escaped
python
it
led
across
the
depot
grounds
and
away
down
a
smaller
street
in
the
direction
of
the
little
canon
as
predicted
by
her
a
stillness
and
lack
of
excitement
in
the
neighbourhood
encouraged
the
hope
that
as
yet
the
inhabitants
were
unaware
that
so
formidable
a
guest
traversed
their
highways
the
heat
had
driven
them
indoors
whence
outdrifted
occasional
shrill
laughs
or
the
depressing
whine
of
a
maltreated
concertina
in
the
shade
a
few
mexican
children
like
vivified
stolid
idols
in
clay
stared
from
their
play
and
silent
as
alvarita
came
and
went
here
and
there
a
woman
peeped
from
a
door
and
stood
dumb
reduced
to
silence
by
the
aspect
of
the
white
silk
parasol
a
hundred
yards
and
the
limits
of
the
town
were
passed
scattered
chaparral
succeeding
and
then
a
noble
grove
overflowing
the
bijou
canon
through
this
a
small
bright
stream
meandered
it
was
with
a
kind
of
cockney
ruralness
further
endorsed
by
the
waste
papers
and
rifled
tins
of
picnickers
up
this
stream
and
down
it
among
its
glades
and
depressions
wandered
the
bright
and
unruffled
alvarita
once
she
saw
evidence
of
the
recreant
progress
in
his
distinctive
trail
across
a
spread
of
fine
sand
in
the
arroyo
the
living
water
was
bound
to
lure
him
he
could
not
be
far
away
so
sure
was
she
of
his
immediate
proximity
that
she
perched
herself
to
idle
for
a
time
in
the
curve
of
a
great
creeper
that
looped
down
from
a
giant
to
reach
this
she
climbed
from
the
pathway
a
little
distance
up
the
side
of
a
steep
and
rugged
incline
around
her
chaparral
grew
thick
and
high
a
ratama
tree
dispensed
from
its
yellow
petals
a
sweet
and
persistent
odour
adown
the
ravine
rustled
a
seductive
wind
melancholy
with
the
taste
of
sodden
fallen
leaves
alvarita
removed
her
hat
and
undoing
the
oppressive
convolutions
of
her
hair
began
to
slowly
arrange
it
in
two
long
dusky
plaits
from
the
obscure
depths
of
a
thick
clump
of
evergreen
shrubs
five
feet
away
two
small
eyes
were
steadfastly
regarding
her
coiled
there
lay
kuku
the
great
python
kuku
the
magnificent
he
of
the
plated
muzzle
the
grooved
lips
the
stretch
of
elegantly
and
brilliantly
mottled
skin
the
great
python
was
viewing
his
mistress
without
a
sound
or
motion
to
disclose
his
presence
perhaps
the
splendid
truant
forefelt
his
capture
but
screened
by
the
foliage
thought
to
prolong
the
delight
of
his
escapade
what
pleasure
it
was
after
the
hot
and
dusty
car
to
lie
thus
smelling
the
running
water
and
feeling
the
agreeable
roughness
of
the
earth
and
stones
against
his
body
soon
very
soon
the
queen
would
find
him
and
he
powerless
as
a
worm
in
her
audacious
hands
would
be
returned
to
the
dark
chest
in
the
narrow
house
that
ran
on
wheels
alvarita
heard
a
sudden
crunching
of
the
gravel
below
her
turning
her
head
she
saw
a
big
swarthy
mexican
with
a
daring
and
evil
expression
contemplating
her
with
an
ominous
dull
eye
what
do
you
want
she
asked
as
sharply
as
five
hairpins
between
her
lips
would
permit
continuing
to
plait
her
hair
and
looking
him
over
with
placid
contempt
the
mexican
continued
to
gaze
at
her
and
showed
his
teeth
in
a
white
jagged
smile
i
no
you
senorita
he
said
you
bet
you
wo
answered
the
queen
shaking
back
one
finished
massive
plait
but
do
you
think
you
better
move
on
not
you
no
but
maybeso
take
one
one
kees
you
call
him
the
man
smiled
again
and
set
his
foot
to
ascend
the
slope
alvarita
leaned
swiftly
and
picked
up
a
stone
the
size
of
a
cocoanut
vamoose
quick
she
ordered
peremptorily
you
the
red
of
insult
burned
through
the
mexican
dark
skin
he
shot
between
his
fangs
i
am
not
for
that
you
shall
pay
me
he
made
two
quick
upward
steps
this
time
but
the
stone
hurled
by
no
weak
arm
struck
him
square
in
the
chest
he
staggered
back
to
the
footway
swerved
half
around
and
met
another
sight
that
drove
all
thoughts
of
the
girl
from
his
head
she
turned
her
eyes
to
see
what
had
diverted
his
interest
a
man
with
curling
hair
and
a
melancholy
sunburned
face
was
coming
up
the
path
twenty
yards
away
around
the
mexican
waist
was
buckled
a
pistol
belt
with
two
empty
holsters
he
had
laid
aside
his
sixes
possibly
in
the
of
the
fair
pancha
and
had
forgotten
them
when
the
passing
of
the
fairer
alvarita
had
enticed
him
to
her
trail
his
hands
now
flew
instinctively
to
the
holsters
but
finding
the
weapons
gone
he
spread
his
fingers
outward
with
the
eloquent
abjuring
deprecating
latin
gesture
and
stood
like
a
rock
seeing
his
plight
the
newcomer
unbuckled
his
own
belt
containing
two
revolvers
threw
it
upon
the
ground
and
continued
to
advance
splendid
murmured
alvarita
with
flashing
eyes
as
bob
buckley
according
to
the
mad
code
of
bravery
that
his
sensitive
conscience
imposed
upon
his
cowardly
nerves
abandoned
his
guns
and
closed
in
upon
his
enemy
the
old
inevitable
nausea
of
abject
fear
wrung
him
his
breath
whistled
through
his
constricted
air
passages
his
feet
seemed
like
lumps
of
lead
his
mouth
was
dry
as
dust
his
heart
congested
with
blood
hurt
his
ribs
as
it
thumped
against
them
the
hot
june
day
turned
to
moist
november
and
still
he
advanced
spurred
by
a
mandatory
pride
that
strained
its
uttermost
against
his
weakling
flesh
the
distance
between
the
two
men
slowly
lessened
the
mexican
stood
immovable
waiting
when
scarce
five
yards
separated
them
a
little
shower
of
loosened
gravel
rattled
down
from
above
to
the
feet
he
glanced
upward
with
instinctive
caution
a
pair
of
dark
eyes
brilliantly
soft
and
fierily
tender
encountered
and
held
his
own
the
most
fearful
heart
and
the
boldest
one
in
all
the
rio
bravo
country
exchanged
a
silent
and
inscrutable
communication
alvarita
still
seated
within
her
vine
leaned
forward
above
the
chaparral
one
hand
was
laid
across
her
bosom
one
great
dark
braid
curved
forward
over
her
shoulder
her
lips
were
parted
her
face
was
lit
with
what
seemed
but
wonder
great
and
absolute
wonder
her
eyes
lingered
upon
buckley
let
no
one
ask
or
presume
to
tell
through
what
subtle
medium
the
miracle
was
performed
as
by
a
lightning
flash
two
clouds
will
accomplish
counterpoise
and
compensation
of
electric
surcharge
so
on
that
eyeglance
the
man
received
his
complement
of
manhood
and
the
maid
conceded
what
enriched
her
womanly
grace
by
its
loss
the
mexican
suddenly
stirring
ventilated
his
attitude
of
apathetic
waiting
by
conjuring
swiftly
from
his
bootleg
a
long
knife
buckley
cast
aside
his
hat
and
laughed
once
aloud
like
a
happy
at
a
frolic
then
he
sprang
nimbly
and
garcia
met
him
without
default
so
soon
was
the
engagement
ended
that
disappointment
imposed
upon
the
ranger
warlike
ecstasy
instead
of
dealing
the
traditional
downward
stroke
the
mexican
lunged
straight
with
his
knife
buckley
took
the
precarious
chance
and
caught
his
wrist
fair
and
firm
then
he
delivered
the
good
saxon
blow
always
so
pathetically
disastrous
to
the
fistless
latin
races
and
garcia
was
down
and
out
with
his
head
under
a
clump
of
prickly
pears
the
ranger
looked
up
again
to
the
queen
of
the
serpents
alvarita
scrambled
down
to
the
path
i
mighty
glad
i
happened
along
when
i
did
said
the
ranger
he
he
frightened
me
so
cooed
alvarita
they
did
not
hear
the
long
low
hiss
of
the
python
under
the
shrubs
wiliest
of
the
beasts
no
doubt
he
was
expressing
the
humiliation
he
felt
at
having
so
long
dwelt
in
subjection
to
this
trembling
and
colouring
mistress
of
his
whom
he
had
deemed
so
strong
and
potent
and
fearsome
then
came
galloping
to
the
spot
the
civic
authorities
and
to
them
the
ranger
awarded
the
prostrate
disturber
of
the
peace
whom
they
bore
away
limply
across
the
saddle
of
one
of
their
mounts
but
buckley
and
alvarita
lingered
slowly
slowly
they
walked
the
ranger
regained
his
belt
of
weapons
with
a
fine
timidity
she
begged
the
indulgence
of
fingering
the
great

little
ohs
and
ahs
of
delicious
shyness
the
was
growing
dusky
beyond
its
terminus
in
the
river
bluff
they
could
see
the
outer
world
yet
suffused
with
the
waning
glory
of
sunset
a
scream
a
piercing
scream
of
fright
from
alvarita
back
she
cowered
and
the
ready
protecting
arm
of
buckley
formed
her
refuge
what
terror
so
dire
as
to
thus
beset
the
close
of
the
reign
of
the
queen
across
the
path
there
crawled
a
a
horrid
fuzzy
inch
caterpillar
truly
kuku
thou
went
avenged
thus
abdicated
the
queen
of
the
serpent
tribe
la
ix
the
higher
abdication
curly
the
tramp
sidled
toward
the
counter
he
caught
a
fleeting
glance
from
the
bartender
eye
and
stood
still
trying
to
look
like
a
business
man
who
had
just
dined
at
the
menger
and
was
waiting
for
a
friend
who
had
promised
to
pick
him
up
in
his
motor
car
curly
histrionic
powers
were
equal
to
the
impersonation
but
his
was
wanting
the
bartender
rounded
the
bar
in
a
casual
way
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
as
though
he
was
pondering
some
intricate
problem
of
kalsomining
and
then
fell
upon
curly
so
suddenly
that
the
roadster
had
no
excuses
ready
irresistibly
but
so
composedly
that
it
seemed
almost
absendmindedness
on
his
part
the
dispenser
of
drinks
pushed
curly
to
the
swinging
doors
and
kicked
him
out
with
a
nonchalance
that
almost
amounted
to
sadness
that
was
the
way
of
the
southwest
curly
arose
from
the
gutter
leisurely
he
felt
no
anger
or
resentment
toward
his
ejector
fifteen
years
of
tramphood
spent
out
of
the
years
of
his
life
had
hardened
the
fibres
of
his
spirit
the
slings
and
arrows
of
outrageous
fortune
fell
blunted
from
the
buckler
of
his
armoured
pride
with
especial
resignation
did
he
suffer
contumely
and
injury
at
the
hands
of
bartenders
naturally
they
were
his
enemies
and
unnaturally
they
were
often
his
friends
he
had
to
take
his
chances
with
them
but
he
had
not
yet
learned
to
estimate
these
cool
languid
southwestern
knights
of
the
bungstarter
who
had
the
manners
of
an
earl
of
pawtucket
and
who
when
they
disapproved
of
your
presence
moved
you
with
the
silence
and
despatch
of
a
chess
automaton
advancing
a
pawn
curly
stood
for
a
few
moments
in
the
narrow
street
san
antonio
puzzled
and
disturbed
him
three
days
he
had
been
a
paying
guest
of
the
town
having
dropped
off
there
from
a
box
car
of
an
i
freight
because
greaser
johnny
had
told
him
in
des
moines
that
the
alamo
city
was
manna
fallen
gathered
cooked
and
served
free
with
cream
and
sugar
curly
had
found
the
tip
partly
a
good
one
there
was
hospitality
in
plenty
of
a
careless
liberal
irregular
sort
but
the
town
itself
was
a
weight
upon
his
spirits
after
his
experience
with
the
rushing
systematised
cities
of
the
north
and
east
here
he
was
often
flung
a
dollar
but
too
frequently
a
kick
would
follow
it
once
a
band
of
hilarious
cowboys
had
roped
him
on
military
plaza
and
dragged
him
across
the
black
soil
until
no
respectable
would
have
stood
sponsor
for
his
clothes
the
winding
doubling
streets
leading
nowhere
bewildered
him
and
then
there
was
a
little
river
crooked
as
a
that
crawled
through
the
middle
of
the
town
crossed
by
a
hundred
little
bridges
so
nearly
alike
that
they
got
on
nerves
and
the
last
bartender
wore
a
number
nine
shoe
the
saloon
stood
on
a
corner
the
hour
was
eight
homefarers
and
outgoers
jostled
curly
on
the
narrow
stone
sidewalk
between
the
buildings
to
his
left
he
looked
down
a
cleft
that
proclaimed
itself
another
thoroughfare
the
alley
was
dark
except
for
one
patch
of
light
where
there
was
light
there
were
sure
to
be
human
beings
where
there
were
human
beings
after
nightfall
in
san
antonio
there
might
be
food
and
there
was
sure
to
be
drink
so
curly
headed
for
the
light
the
illumination
came
from
schwegel
cafe
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
it
curly
picked
up
an
old
envelope
it
might
have
contained
a
check
for
a
million
it
was
empty
but
the
wanderer
read
the
address
otto

and
the
name
of
the
town
and
state
the
postmark
was
detroit
curly
entered
the
saloon
and
now
in
the
light
it
could
be
perceived
that
he
bore
the
stamp
of
many
years
of
vagabondage
he
had
none
of
the
tidiness
of
the
calculating
and
shrewd
professional
tramp
his
wardrobe
represented
the
specimens
of
half
a
dozen
fashions
and
eras
two
factories
had
combined
their
efforts
in
providing
shoes
for
his
feet
as
you
gazed
at
him
there
passed
through
your
mind
vague
impressions
of
mummies
wax
figures
russian
exiles
and
men
lost
on
desert
islands
his
face
was
covered
almost
to
his
eyes
with
a
curly
brown
beard
that
he
kept
trimmed
short
with
a
and
that
had
furnished
him
with
his
de
eyes
full
of
sullenness
fear
cunning
impudence
and
fawning
witnessed
the
stress
that
had
been
laid
upon
his
soul
the
saloon
was
small
and
in
its
atmosphere
the
odours
of
meat
and
drink
struggled
for
the
ascendancy
the
pig
and
the
cabbage
wrestled
with
hydrogen
and
oxygen
behind
the
bar
schwegel
laboured
with
an
assistant
whose
epidermal
pores
showed
no
signs
of
being
obstructed
hot
weinerwurst
and
sauerkraut
were
being
served
to
purchasers
of
beer
curly
shuffled
to
the
end
of
the
bar
coughed
hollowly
and
told
schwegel
that
he
was
a
detroit
out
of
a
job
it
followed
as
the
night
the
day
that
he
got
his
schooner
and
lunch
was
you
acquainted
maybe
with
heinrich
strauss
in
detroit
asked
schwegel
did
i
know
heinrich
strauss
repeated
curly
affectionately
why
say
i
wish
i
had
a
dollar
for
every
game
of
pinochle
me
and
heine
has
played
on
sunday
afternoons
more
beer
and
a
second
plate
of
steaming
food
was
set
before
the
diplomat
and
then
curly
knowing
to
a
how
far
a
con
game
would
go
shuffled
out
into
the
unpromising
street
and
now
he
began
to
perceive
the
inconveniences
of
this
stony
southern
town
there
was
none
of
the
outdoor
gaiety
and
brilliancy
and
music
that
provided
distraction
even
to
the
poorest
in
the
cities
of
the
north
here
even
so
early
the
gloomy
houses
were
closed
and
barred
against
the
murky
dampness
of
the
night
the
streets
were
mere
fissures
through
which
flowed
grey
wreaths
of
river
mist
as
he
walked
he
heard
laughter
and
the
chink
of
coin
and
chips
behind
darkened
windows
and
music
coming
from
every
chink
of
wood
and
stone
but
the
diversions
were
selfish
the
day
of
popular
pastimes
had
not
yet
come
to
san
antonio
but
at
length
curly
as
he
strayed
turned
the
sharp
angle
of
another
lost
street
and
came
upon
a
rollicking
band
of
stockmen
from
the
outlying
ranches
celebrating
in
the
open
in
front
of
an
ancient
wooden
hotel
one
great
roisterer
from
the
sheep
country
who
had
just
instigated
a
movement
toward
the
bar
swept
curly
in
like
a
stray
goat
with
the
rest
of
his
flock
the
princes
of
kine
and
wool
hailed
him
as
a
new
zoological
discovery
and
uproariously
strove
to
preserve
him
in
the
diluted
alcohol
of
their
compliments
and
regards
an
hour
afterward
curly
staggered
from
the
hotel
barroom
dismissed
by
his
fickle
friends
whose
interest
in
him
had
subsided
as
quickly
as
it
had
risen
full
stoked
with
alcoholic
fuel
and
cargoed
with
food
the
only
question
remaining
to
disturb
him
was
that
of
shelter
and
bed
a
drizzling
cold
texas
rain
had
begun
to
fall
an
endless
lazy
unintermittent
downfall
that
lowered
the
spirits
of
men
and
raised
a
reluctant
steam
from
the
warm
stones
of
the
streets
and
houses
thus
comes
the
norther
dousing
gentle
spring
and
amiable
autumn
with
the
chilling
salutes
and
adieux
of
coming
and
departing
winter
curly
followed
his
nose
down
the
first
tortuous
street
into
which
his
irresponsible
feet
conducted
him
at
the
lower
end
of
it
on
the
bank
of
the
serpentine
stream
he
perceived
an
open
gate
in
a
cemented
rock
wall
inside
he
saw
camp
fires
and
a
row
of
low
wooden
sheds
built
against
three
sides
of
the
enclosing
wall
he
entered
the
enclosure
under
the
sheds
many
horses
were
champing
at
their
oats
and
corn
many
wagons
and
buckboards
stood
about
with
their
teams
harness
thrown
carelessly
upon
the
shafts
and
doubletrees
curly
recognised
the
place
as
a
such
as
is
provided
by
merchants
for
their
town
friends
and
customers
no
one
was
in
sight
no
doubt
the
drivers
of
those
wagons
were
scattered
about
the
town
seeing
the
elephant
and
hearing
the
owl
in
their
haste
to
become
patrons
of
the
dispensaries
of
mirth
and
good
cheer
the
last
ones
to
depart
must
have
left
the
great
wooden
gate
swinging
open
curly
had
satisfied
the
hunger
of
an
anaconda
and
the
thirst
of
a
camel
so
he
was
neither
in
the
mood
nor
the
condition
of
an
explorer
he
zigzagged
his
way
to
the
first
wagon
that
his
eyesight
distinguished
in
the
under
the
shed
it
was
a
wagon
with
a
top
of
white
canvas
the
wagon
was
half
filled
with
loose
piles
of
wool
sacks
two
or
three
great
bundles
of
grey
blankets
and
a
number
of
bales
bundles
and
boxes
a
reasoning
eye
would
have
estimated
the
load
at
once
as
ranch
supplies
bound
on
the
morrow
for
some
outlying
hacienda
but
to
the
drowsy
intelligence
of
curly
they
represented
only
warmth
and
softness
and
protection
against
the
cold
humidity
of
the
night
after
several
unlucky
efforts
at
last
he
conquered
gravity
so
far
as
to
climb
over
a
wheel
and
pitch
forward
upon
the
best
and
warmest
bed
he
had
fallen
upon
in
many
a
day
then
he
became
instinctively
a
burrowing
animal
and
dug
his
way
like
a
down
among
the
sacks
and
blankets
hiding
himself
from
the
cold
air
as
snug
and
safe
as
a
bear
in
his
den
for
three
nights
sleep
had
visited
curly
only
in
broken
and
shivering
doses
so
now
when
morpheus
condescended
to
pay
him
a
call
curly
got
such
a
strangle
hold
on
the
mythological
old
gentleman
that
it
was
a
wonder
that
anyone
else
in
the
whole
world
got
a
wink
of
sleep
that
night
six
cowpunchers
of
the
cibolo
ranch
were
waiting
around
the
door
of
the
ranch
store
their
ponies
cropped
grass
near
by
tied
in
the
texas
fashion
which
is
not
tied
at
all
their
bridle
reins
had
been
dropped
to
the
earth
which
is
a
more
effectual
way
of
securing
them
such
is
the
power
of
habit
and
imagination
than
you
could
devise
out
of
a
rope
and
a
tree
these
guardians
of
the
cow
lounged
about
each
with
a
brown
cigarette
paper
in
his
hand
and
gently
but
unceasingly
cursed
sam
revell
the
storekeeper
sam
stood
in
the
door
snapping
the
red
elastic
bands
on
his
pink
madras
shirtsleeves
and
looking
down
affectionately
at
the
only
pair
of
tan
shoes
within
a
radius
his
offence
had
been
serious
and
he
was
divided
between
humble
apology
and
admiration
for
the
beauty
of
his
raiment
he
had
allowed
the
ranch
stock
of
smoking
to
become
exhausted
i
thought
sure
there
was
another
case
of
it
under
the
counter
boys

explained
but

be

rodgers
i
wait

the
tobaccoless
punchers
arranged
themselves
comfortably
on
the
steps
of
the
store
inside
sam
chopped
open
with
a
hatchet
the
tops
of
the
cans
of
fruit
the
store
a
big
white
wooden
building
like
a
barn
stood
fifty
yards
from
the
beyond
it
were
the
horse
corrals
and
still
farther
the
wool
sheds
and
the
shearing
pens
for
the
rancho
cibolo
raised
both
cattle
and
sheep
behind
the
store
at
a
little
distance
were
the
of
the
mexicans
who
bestowed
their
allegiance
upon
the
cibolo
the
was
composed
of
four
large
rooms
with
plastered
adobe
walls
and
a
wooden
ell
a
gallery
circumvented
the
structure
it
was
set
in
a
grove
of
immense
and
near
a
lake
a
long
not
very
wide
and
tremendously
deep
lake
in
which
at
nightfall
great
gars
leaped
to
the
surface
and
plunged
with
the
noise
of
hippopotamuses
frolicking
at
their
bath
from
the
trees
hung
garlands
and
massive
pendants
of
the
melancholy
grey
moss
of
the
south
indeed
the
cibolo
seemed
more
of
the
south
than
of
the
west
it
looked
as
if
old
kiowa
truesdell
might
have
brought
it
with
him
from
the
lowlands
of
mississippi
when
he
came
to
texas
with
his
rifle
in
the
hollow
of
his
arm
in
but
though
he
did
not
bring
the
family
mansion
truesdell
did
bring
something
in
the
way
of
a
family
inheritance
that
was
more
lasting
than
brick
or
stone
he
brought
one
end
of
the
family
feud
and
when
a
curtis
bought
the
rancho
de
los
olmos
sixteen
miles
from
the
cibolo
there
were
lively
times
on
the
pear
flats
and
in
the
chaparral
thickets
off
the
southwest
in
those
days
truesdell
cleaned
the
brush
of
many
a
wolf
and
tiger
cat
and
mexican
lion
and
one
or
two
curtises
fell
heirs
to
notches
on
his
rifle
stock
also
he
buried
a
brother
with
a
curtis
bullet
in
him
on
the
bank
of
the
lake
at
cibolo
and
then
the
kiowa
indians
made
their
last
raid
upon
the
ranches
between
the
frio
and
the
rio
grande
and
truesdell
at
the
head
of
his
rangers
rid
the
earth
of
them
to
the
last
brave
earning
his
sobriquet
then
came
prosperity
in
the
form
of
waxing
herds
and
broadening
lands
and
then
old
age
and
bitterness
when
he
sat
with
his
great
mane
of
hair
as
white
as
the
blossoms
and
his
fierce
eyes
on
the
shaded
gallery
at
cibolo
growling
like
the
pumas
that
he
had
slain
he
snapped
his
fingers
at
old
age
the
bitter
taste
to
life
did
not
come
from
that
the
cup
that
stuck
at
his
lips
was
that
his
only
son
ransom
wanted
to
marry
a
curtis
the
last
youthful
survivor
of
the
other
end
of
the
feud
for
a
while
the
only
sounds
to
be
heard
at
the
store
were
the
rattling
of
the
tin
spoons
and
the
gurgling
intake
of
the
juicy
fruits
by
the
cowpunchers
the
stamping
of
the
grazing
ponies
and
the
singing
of
a
doleful
song
by
sam
as
he
contentedly
brushed
his
stiff
auburn
hair
for
the
twentieth
time
that
day
before
a
crinkly
mirror
from
the
door
of
the
store
could
be
seen
the
irregular
sloping
stretch
of
prairie
to
the
south
with
its
reaches
of
billowy
mesquite
flats
in
the
lower
places
and
its
rises
crowned
with
nearly
black
masses
of
short
chaparral
through
the
mesquite
flat
wound
the
ranch
road
that
five
miles
away
flowed
into
the
old
government
trail
to
san
antonio
the
sun
was
so
low
that
the
gentlest
elevation
cast
its
grey
shadow
miles
into
the
sea
of
sunshine
that
evening
ears
were
quicker
than
eyes
the
mexican
held
up
a
tawny
finger
to
still
the
scraping
of
tin
against
tin

said
gregorio
smiling
two
miles
away
they
saw
a
faint
cloud
dimming
the
green
ripples
of
the
mesquites
in
twenty
minutes
they
heard
the
clatter
of
the
hoofs
in
five
minutes
more
the
grey
plugs
dashed
out
of
the
thicket
whickering
for
oats
and
drawing
the
light
wagon
behind
them
like
a
toy
from
the
came
a
cry
of
el
amo
el

four
mexican
youths
raced
to
unharness
the
greys
the
cowpunchers
gave
a
yell
of
greeting
and
delight
ranse
truesdell
driving
threw
the
reins
to
the
ground

laughed
it
under

thrown
it
over
the

in
the

messenger
from

stirrups
west
of

mississippi
delved
with
an
arm
like
the
tongue
of
a
wagon
he
caught
something
harder
than
a
blanket
and
pulled
out
a
fearful
thing
a
shapeless
muddy
bunch
of
leather
tied
together
with
wire
and
twine
from
its
ragged
end
like
the

curly
like
some
vile
worm
from
its
burrow
he
clawed
his
way
out
and
sat
blinking
like
a
disreputable
drunken
owl
his
face
was
as
and
puffed
and
seamed
and
as
the
cheapest
round
steak
of
the
butcher
his
eyes
were
swollen
slits
his
nose
a
pickled
beet
his
hair
would
have
made
the
wildest
thatch

the

looked
around
him
slowly
in
every
direction
he
snarled
like
a
scotch
terrier
through
his
ragged
beard
where

he
rasped
through
his
parched
throat
it
a

took
a
slide
and
felt

ground
rise
up
and
collide
with
his
shoulder
blades
he
got
up
and
sat
on
the
steps
of
the
store
shivering
from
outraged
nerves
hugging
his
knees
and
sneering
taylor
lifted
out
a
case
of
tobacco

wrenched
off
its
top
six
cigarettes

to
glow
bringing
peace

forgiveness
to

how

ranse
this
time
in
a
voice
that
drew
a
reply

recognised
the
tone
he
had
heard
it
used
by
freight
brakemen
and
large
persons
in
blue
carrying
clubs

he
growled

pedro
the
mexican

up
to
bring
the
food
he
was
keeping
warm
in
the
stove
just
a
cup
of
coffee
pedro
he
said
and
drank
it
standing
and
then
there
a
tramp
on
a
cot
in
the
take
him
something
to

it
enough
for

ranse
walked
out
toward

a
boy

him
as
quick
as
you
can
soon
mounted
on
vaminos
ranse
leaned
in
the
saddle
pressed
with
his
knees
and
galloped
eastward
past
the
store
where
sat
sam
trying
his
guitar
in
the
moonlight
vaminos
shall
have
a
word
vaminos
the
good
dun
horse
the
mexicans
who
have
a
hundred
names
for
the
colours
of
a
horse
called
him
he
was
a
dun
if
you
can
conceive
it
down
his
back
from
his
mane
to
his
tail
went
a
line
of
black
he
would
live
forever
and
surveyors
have
not
laid
off
as
many
miles
in
the
world
as
he
could
travel
in
a
day
eight
miles
east
of
the
cibolo
ranse
loosened
the
pressure
of
his
knees
and
vaminos
stopped
under
a
big
ratama
tree
the
yellow
ratama
blossoms
showered
fragrance
that
would
have
undone
the
roses
of
france
the
moon
made
the
earth
a
great
concave
bowl
with
a
crystal
sky
for
a
lid
in
a
glade
five
leaped
and
played
together
like
kittens
eight
miles
farther
east
shone
a
faint
star
that
appeared
to
have
dropped
below
the
horizon
night
riders
who
often
steered
their
course
by
it
knew
it
to
be
the
light
in
the
rancho
de
los
olmos
in
ten
minutes
yenna
curtis
galloped
to
the
tree
on
her
sorrel
pony
dancer
the
two
leaned
and
clasped
hands
heartily
i
ought
to
have
ridden
nearer
your
home
said
ranse
but
you
never
will
let
me
yenna
laughed
and
in
the
soft
light
you
could
see
her
strong
white
teeth
and
fearless
eyes
no
sentimentality
there
in
spite
of
the
moonlight
the
odour
of
the
ratamas
and
the
admirable
figure
of
ranse
truesdell
the
lover
but
she
was
there
eight
miles
from
her
home
to
meet
him
how
often
have
i
told
you
ranse
she
said
that
i
am
your
girl
always
well
said
ranse
with
a
question
in
his
tones
i
did
said
yenna
with
almost
a
sigh
i
told
him
after
dinner
when
i
thought
he
would
be
in
a
good
humour
did
you
ever
wake
up
a
lion
ranse
with
the
mistaken
idea
that
he
would
be
a
kitten
he
almost
tore
the
ranch
to
pieces
it
all
up
i
love
my
daddy
ranse
and
afraid
i
afraid
of
him
too
he
ordered
me
to
promise
that
i
never
marry
a
truesdell
i
promised
that
all
what
luck
did
you
have
the
same
said
ranse
slowly
i
promised
him
that
his
son
would
never
marry
a
curtis
somehow
i
could
go
against
him
he
mighty
old
i
sorry
yenna
the
girl
leaned
in
her
saddle
and
laid
one
hand
on
ranse
on
the
horn
of
his
saddle
i
never
thought
i
like
you
better
for
giving
me
up
she
said
ardently
but
i
do
i
must
ride
back
now
ranse
i
slipped
out
of
the
house
and
saddled
dancer
myself
neighbour
said
ranse
ride
carefully
over
them
badger
holes
they
wheeled
and
rode
away
in
opposite
directions
yenna
turned
in
her
saddle
and
called
clearly
do
forget
i
your
girl
ranse
damn
all
family
feuds
and
inherited
scraps
muttered
ranse
vindictively
to
the
breeze
as
he
rode
back
to
the
cibolo
ranse
turned
his
horse
into
the
small
pasture
and
went
to
his
own
room
he
opened
the
lowest
drawer
of
an
old
bureau
to
get
out
the
packet
of
letters
that
yenna
had
written
him
one
summer
when
she
had
gone
to
mississippi
for
a
visit
the
drawer
stuck
and
he
yanked
at
it
savagely
as
a
man
will
it
came
out
of
the
bureau
and
bruised
both
his
shins
as
a
drawer
will
an
old
folded
yellow
letter
without
an
envelope
fell
from
somewhere
probably
from
where
it
had
lodged
in
one
of
the
upper
drawers
ranse
took
it
to
the
lamp
and
read
it
curiously
then
he
took
his
hat
and
walked
to
one
of
the
mexican
tia
juana
he
said
i
would
like
to
talk
with
you
a
while
an
old
old
mexican
woman
and
wonderfully
wrinkled
rose
from
a
stool
sit
down
said
ranse
removing
his
hat
and
taking
the
one
chair
in
the
who
am
i
tia
juana
he
asked
speaking
spanish
don
ransom
our
good
friend
and
employer
why
do
you
ask
answered
the
old
woman
wonderingly
tia
juana
who
am
i
he
repeated
with
his
stern
eyes
looking
into
hers
a
frightened
look
came
in
the
old
woman
face
she
fumbled
with
her
black
shawl
who
am
i
tia
juana
said
ranse
once
more
years
i
have
lived
on
the
rancho
cibolo
said
tia
juana
i
thought
to
be
buried
under
the
coma
mott
beyond
the
garden
before
these
things
should
be
known
close
the
door
don
ransom
and
i
will
speak
i
see
in
your
face
that
you
know
an
hour
ranse
spent
behind
tia
juana
closed
door
as
he
was
on
his
way
back
to
the
house
curly
called
to
him
from
the
the
tramp
sat
on
his
cot
swinging
his
feet
and
smoking
say
sport
he
grumbled
this
is
no
way
to
treat
a
man
after
kidnappin
him
i
went
up
to
the
store
and
borrowed
a
razor
from
that
fresh
guy
and
had
a
shave
but
that
ai
all
a
man
needs
say
you
loosen
up
for
about
three
fingers
more
of
that
booze
i
never
asked
you
to
bring
me
to
your
d
d
farm
stand
up
out
here
in
the
light
said
ranse
looking
at
him
closely
curly
got
up
sullenly
and
took
a
step
or
two
his
face
now
shaven
smooth
seemed
transformed
his
hair
had
been
combed
and
it
fell
back
from
the
right
side
of
his
forehead
with
a
peculiar
wave
the
moonlight
charitably
softened
the
ravages
of
drink
and
his
aquiline
nose
and
small
square
cleft
chin
almost
gave
distinction
to
his
looks
ranse
sat
on
the
foot
of
the
cot
and
looked
at
him
curiously
where
did
you
come
from
have
you
got
any
home
or
folks
anywhere

a
dook

hardly
big
enough
to
reach
the
latch
of
a
gate

he

asked
ranse
once
when
he
was

band
of

around
after
crazy
sheep
like
that
pink

boss
ranse
paid
a
visit
to
the
store
before
going
to
the
house
sam
rivell
was
taking
off
his
tan
shoes
regretting
and
preparing
for
bed
any
of
the
boys
from
the
san
gabriel
camp
riding
in
early
in
the
morning
asked
ranse
long
collins

sam
briefly
for
the
mail

him
said
ranse
to
take
that
tramp
out
to
camp
with
him
and
keep
him
till
i
get
there
curly
was
sitting
on
his
blankets
in
the
san
gabriel
camp
cursing
talentedly
when
ranse
truesdell
rode
up
and
dismounted
on
the
next
afternoon
the
cowpunchers
were
ignoring
the
stray
he
was
grimy
with
dust
and
black
dirt
his
clothes
were
making
their
last
stand
in
favour
of
the
conventions
ranse
went
up
to
buck
rabb
the
camp
boss
and
spoke
briefly
he
a
plumb
buzzard
said
buck
he
wo
work
and
he
the
downest
passel
of
inhumanity
i
ever
see
i
did
know
what
you
wanted
done
with
him
ranse
so
i
just
let
him
set
that
seems
to
suit
him
he
been
condemned
to
death
by
the
boys
a
dozen
times
but
i
told
maybe
you
was
savin
him
for
the
torture
ranse
took
off
his
coat
i
got
a
hard
job
before
me
buck
i
reckon
but
it
has
to
be
done
i
got
to
make
a
man
out
of
that
thing
that
what
i
come
to
camp
for
he
went
up
to
curly
brother
he
said
do
you
think
if
you
had
a
bath
it
would
allow
you
to
take
a
seat
in
the
company
of
your
with
less
injustice
to
the
atmosphere
run
away
farmer
said
curly
sardonically
willie
will
send
for
nursey
when
he
feels
like
having
his
tub
the
or
water
hole
was
twelve
yards
away
ranse
took
one
of
curly
ankles
and
dragged
him
like
a
sack
of
potatoes
to
the
brink
then
with
the
strength
and
sleight
of
a
he
hurled
the
offending
member
of
society
far
into
the
lake
curly
crawled
out
and
up
the
bank
spluttering
like
a
porpoise
ranse
met
him
with
a
piece
of
soap
and
a
coarse
towel
in
his
hands
go
to
the
other
end
of
the
lake
and
use
this
he
said
buck
will
give
you
some
dry
clothes
at
the
wagon
the
tramp
obeyed
without
protest
by
the
time
supper
was
ready
he
had
returned
to
camp
he
was
hardly
to
be
recognised
in
his
new
shirt
and
brown
duck
clothes
ranse
observed
him
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
lordy
i
hope
he
ai
a
coward
he
was
saying
to
himself
i
hope
he
wo
turn
out
to
be
a
coward
his
doubts
were
soon
allayed
curly
walked
straight
to
where
he
stood
his
eyes
were
blazing
now
i
clean
he
said
meaningly
maybe
you
talk
to
me
think
you
got
a
picnic
here
do
you
you
clodhoppers
think
you
can
run
over
a
man
because
you
know
he
ca
get
away
all
right
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
curly
planted
a
stinging
slap
against
ranse
left
cheek
the
print
of
his
hand
stood
out
a
dull
red
against
the
tan
ranse
smiled
happily
the
cowpunchers
talk
to
this
day
of
the
battle
that
followed
somewhere
in
his
restless
tour
of
the
cities
curly
had
acquired
the
art
of
the
ranchman
was
equipped
only
with
the
splendid
strength
and
equilibrium
of
perfect
health
and
the
endurance
conferred
by
decent
living
the
two
attributes
nearly
matched
there
were
no
formal
rounds
at
last
the
fibre
of
the
clean
liver
prevailed
the
last
time
curly
went
down
from
one
of
the
ranchman
awkward
but
powerful
blows
he
remained
on
the
grass
but
looking
up
with
an
unquenched
eye
ranse
went
to
the
water
barrel
and
washed
the
red
from
a
cut
on
his
chin
in
the
stream
from
the
faucet
on
his
face
was
a
grin
of
satisfaction
much
benefit
might
accrue
to
educators
and
moralists
if
they
could
know
the
details
of
the
curriculum
of
reclamation
through
which
ranse
put
his
waif
during
the
month
that
he
spent
in
the
san
gabriel
camp
the
ranchman
had
no
fine
theories
to
work
out
perhaps
his
whole
stock
of
pedagogy
embraced
only
a
knowledge
of
and
a
belief
in
heredity
the
cowpunchers
saw
that
their
boss
was
trying
to
make
a
man
out
of
the
strange
animal
that
he
had
sent
among
them
and
they
tacitly
organised
themselves
into
a
faculty
of
assistants
but
their
system
was
their
own
curly
first
lesson
stuck
he
became
on
friendly
and
then
on
intimate
terms
with
soap
and
water
and
the
thing
that
pleased
ranse
most
was
that
his
subject
held
his
ground
at
each
successive
higher
step
but
the
steps
were
sometimes
far
apart
once
he
got
at
the
quart
bottle
of
whisky
kept
sacredly
in
the
grub
tent
for
rattlesnake
bites
and
spent
sixteen
hours
on
the
grass
magnificently
drunk
but
when
he
staggered
to
his
feet
his
first
move
was
to
find
his
soap
and
towel
and
start
for
the
and
once
when
a
treat
came
from
the
ranch
in
the
form
of
a
basket
of
fresh
tomatoes
and
young
onions
curly
devoured
the
entire
consignment
before
the
punchers
reached
the
camp
at
supper
time
and
then
the
punchers
punished
him
in
their
own
way
for
three
days
they
did
not
speak
to
him
except
to
reply
to
his
own
questions
or
remarks
and
they
spoke
with
absolute
and
unfailing
politeness
they
played
tricks
on
one
another
they
pounded
one
another
hurtfully
and
affectionately
they
heaped
upon
one
another
heads
friendly
curses
and
obloquy
but
they
were
polite
to
curly
he
saw
it
and
it
stung
him
as
much
as
ranse
hoped
it
would
then
came
a
night
that
brought
a
cold
wet
norther
wilson
the
youngest
of
the
outfit
had
lain
in
camp
two
days
ill
with
fever
when
joe
got
up
at
daylight
to
begin
breakfast
he
found
curly
sitting
asleep
against
a
wheel
of
the
grub
wagon
with
only
a
saddle
blanket
around
him
while
curly
blankets
were
stretched
over
wilson
to
protect
him
from
the
rain
and
wind
three
nights
after
that
curly
rolled
himself
in
his
blanket
and
went
to
sleep
then
the
other
punchers
rose
up
softly
and
began
to
make
preparations
ranse
saw
long
collins
tie
a
rope
to
the
horn
of
a
saddle
others
were
getting
out
their
boys
said
ranse
i
much
obliged
i
was
hoping
you
would
but
i
did
like
to
ask
half
a
dozen
began
to
pop
awful
yells
rent
the
air
long
collins
galloped
wildly
across
curly
bed
dragging
the
saddle
after
him
that
was
merely
their
way
of
gently
awaking
their
victim
then
they
hazed
him
for
an
hour
carefully
and
ridiculously
after
the
code
of
cow
camps
whenever
he
uttered
protest
they
held
him
stretched
over
a
roll
of
blankets
and
thrashed
him
woefully
with
a
pair
of
leather
leggings
and
all
this
meant
that
curly
had
won
his
spurs
that
he
was
receiving
the
puncher
accolade
nevermore
would
they
be
polite
to
him
but
he
would
be
their
pardner
and
foot
to
foot
when
the
fooling
was
ended
all
hands
made
a
raid
on
joe
big
pot
by
the
fire
for
a
java
nightcap
ranse
watched
the
new
knight
carefully
to
see
if
he
understood
and
was
worthy
curly
limped
with
his
cup
of
coffee
to
a
log
and
sat
upon
it
long
collins
followed
and
sat
by
his
side
buck
rabb
went
and
sat
at
the
other
curly
grinned
and
then
ranse
furnished
curly
with
mounts
and
saddle
and
equipment
and
turned
him
over
to
buck
rabb
instructing
him
to
finish
the
job
three
weeks
later
ranse
rode
from
the
ranch
into
rabb
camp
which
was
then
in
snake
valley
the
boys
were
saddling
for
the
day
ride
he
sought
out
long
collins
among
them
how
about
that
bronco
he
asked
long
collins
grinned
reach
out
your
hand
ranse
truesdell
he
said
and
you
touch
him
and
you
can
shake
too
if
you
like
for
he
plumb
white
and
there
none
better
in
no
camp
ranse
looked
again
at
the
bronzed
smiling
cowpuncher
who
stood
at
collins
side
could
that
be
curly
he
held
out
his
hand
and
curly
grasped
it
with
the
muscles
of
a
i
want
you
at
the
ranch
said
ranse
all
right
sport
said
curly
heartily
but
i
want
to
come
back
again
say
pal
this
is
a
dandy
farm
and
i
do
want
any
better
fun
than
hustlin
cows
with
this
bunch
of
guys
they
all
to
the
merry
at
the
cibolo
they
dismounted
ranse
bade
curly
wait
at
the
door
of
the
living
room
he
walked
inside
old
kiowa
truesdell
was
reading
at
a
table
truesdell
said
ranse
the
old
man
turned
his
white
head
quickly
how
is
this
he
began
why
do
you
call
me
when
he
looked
at
ranse
face
he
stopped
and
the
hand
that
held
his
newspaper
shook
slightly
boy
he
said
slowly
how
did
you
find
it
out
it
all
right
said
ranse
with
a
smile
i
made
tia
juana
tell
me
it
was
kind
of
by
accident
but
it
all
right
you
been
like
a
son
to
me
said
old
kiowa
trembling
tia
juana
told
me
all
about
it
said
ranse
she
told
me
how
you
adopted
me
when
i
was
to
a
puddle
duck
out
of
a
wagon
train
of
prospectors
that
was
bound
west
and
she
told
me
how
the
kid
your
own
kid
you
know
got
lost
or
was
run
away
with
and
she
said
it
was
the
same
day
that
the
got
on
a
bender
and
left
the
ranch
our
boy
strayed
from
the
house
when
he
was
two
years
old
said
the
old
man
and
then
along
came
those
emigrant
wagons
with
a
youngster
they
did
want
and
we
took
you
i
never
intended
you
to
know
ranse
we
never
heard
of
our
boy
again
he
right
outside
unless
i
mighty
mistaken
said
ranse
opening
the
door
and
beckoning
curly
walked
in
no
one
could
have
doubted
the
old
man
and
the
young
had
the
same
sweep
of
hair
the
same
nose
chin
line
of
face
and
prominent
blue
eyes
old
kiowa
rose
eagerly
curly
looked
about
the
room
curiously
a
puzzled
expression
came
over
his
face
he
pointed
to
the
wall
opposite
where
the
he
asked
the
clock
cried
old
kiowa
loudly
the
clock
used
to
stand
there
why
he
turned
to
ranse
but
ranse
was
not
there
already
a
hundred
yards
away
vaminos
the
good
dun
was
bearing
him
eastward
like
a
racer
through
dust
and
chaparral
towards
the
rancho
de
los
olmos
x
cupid
a
la
carte
the
dispositions
of
woman
said
jeff
peters
after
various
opinions
on
the
subject
had
been
advanced
run
regular
to
diversions
what
a
woman
wants
is
what
you
out
of
she
wants
more
of
a
thing
when
scarce
she
likes
to
have
souvenirs
of
things
that
never
happened
she
likes
to
be
reminded
of
things
she
never
heard
of
a
view
of
objects
is
disjointing
to
the
female
composition
is
a
misfortune
of
mine
begotten
by
nature
and
travel
continued
jeff
looking
thoughtfully
between
his
elevated
feet
at
the
grocery
stove
to
look
deeper
into
some
subjects
than
most
people
do
breathed
gasoline
smoke
talking
to
street
crowds
in
nearly
every
town
in
the
united
states
i
held
spellbound
with
music
oratory
sleight
of
hand
and
prevarications
while
i
sold
jewelry
medicine
soap
hair
tonic
and
junk
of
other
nominations
and
during
my
travels
as
a
matter
of
recreation
and
expiation
i
taken
cognisance
some
of
women
it
takes
a
man
a
lifetime
to
find
out
about
one
particular
woman
but
if
he
puts
in
say
ten
years
industrious
and
curious
he
can
acquire
the
general
rudiments
of
the
sex
one
lesson
i
picked
up
was
when
i
was
working
the
west
with
a
line
of
brazilian
diamonds
and
a
patent
fire
kindler
just
after
my
trip
from
savannah
down
through
the
cotton
belt
with
dalby
lamp
oil
powder
was
when
the
oklahoma
country
was
in
first
bloom
guthrie
was
rising
in
the
middle
of
it
like
a
lump
of
dough
it
was
a
boom
town
of
the
regular
kind
you
stood
in
line
to
get
a
chance
to
wash
your
face
if
you
ate
over
ten
minutes
you
had
a
lodging
bill
added
on
if
you
slept
on
a
plank
at
night
they
charged
it
to
you
as
board
the
next
morning
by
nature
and
doctrines
i
am
addicted
to
the
habit
of
discovering
choice
places
wherein
to
feed
so
i
looked
around
and
found
a
proposition
that
exactly
cut
the
mustard
i
found
a
restaurant
tent
just
opened
up
by
an
outfit
that
had
drifted
in
on
the
tail
of
the
boom
they
had
knocked
together
a
box
house
where
they
lived
and
did
the
cooking
and
served
the
meals
in
a
tent
pitched
against
the
side
that
tent
was
joyful
with
placards
on
it
calculated
to
redeem
the
pilgrim
from
the
sinfulness
of
boarding
houses
and
up
hotels
mother
biscuits
the
matter
with
our
apple
dumplings
and
hard
sauce
cakes
and
maple
syrup
like
you
ate
when
a
boy
fried
chicken
never
was
heard
to
crow
there
was
literature
doomed
to
please
the
digestions
of
man
i
said
to
myself
that
mother
wandering
boy
should
munch
there
that
night
and
so
it
came
to
pass
and
there
is
where
i
contracted
my
case
of
mame
dugan
old
man
dugan
was
six
feet
by
one
of
indiana
loafer
and
he
spent
his
time
sitting
on
his
shoulder
blades
in
a
in
the
shanty
memorialising
the
great
failure
of
ma
dugan
did
the
cooking
and
mame
waited
on
the
table
as
soon
as
i
saw
mame
i
knew
there
was
a
mistake
in
the
census
reports
there
was
but
one
girl
in
the
united
states
when
you
come
to
specifications
it
is
easy
she
was
about
the
size
of
an
angel
and
she
had
eyes
and
ways
about
her
when
you
come
to
the
kind
of
a
girl
she
was
you
find
a
belt
of
reaching
from
the
brooklyn
bridge
west
as
far
as
the
courthouse
in
council
bluffs
ia
they
earn
their
own
living
in
stores
restaurants
factories
and
offices
they
chummy
and
honest
and
free
and
tender
and
sassy
and
they
look
life
straight
in
the
eye
they
met
man
face
to
face
and
discovered
that
he
a
poor
creature
they
dropped
to
it
that
the
reports
in
the
seaside
library
about
his
being
a
fairy
prince
lack
confirmation
mame
was
that
sort
she
was
full
of
life
and
fun
and
breezy
she
passed
the
repartee
with
the
boarders
quick
as
a
wink
you
have
smothered
laughing
i
am
disinclined
to
make
excavations
into
the
insides
of
a
personal
affection
i
am
glued
to
the
theory
that
the
diversions
and
discrepancies
of
the
indisposition
known
as
love
should
be
as
private
a
sentiment
as
a
toothbrush
is
my
opinion
that
the
biographies
of
the
heart
should
be
confined
with
the
historical
romances
of
the
liver
to
the
advertising
pages
of
the
magazines
so
you
excuse
the
lack
of
an
itemised
bill
of
my
feelings
toward
mame
pretty
soon
i
got
a
regular
habit
of
dropping
into
the
tent
to
eat
at
irregular
times
when
there
was
so
many
around
mame
would
sail
in
with
a
smile
in
a
black
dress
and
white
apron
and
say
jeff
why
do
you
come
at
mealtime
want
to
see
how
much
trouble
you
can
be
of
course
friedchickenbeefsteakporkchopshamandeggspotpie
and
so
on
she
called
me
jeff
but
there
was
no
significations
attached
designations
was
all
she
meant
the
front
names
of
any
of
us
she
used
as
they
came
to
hand
i
eat
about
two
meals
before
i
left
and
string
out
like
a
society
spread
where
they
changed
plates
and
wives
and
josh
one
another
festively
between
bites
mame
stood
for
it
pleasant
for
it
was
up
to
her
to
take
any
canvas
off
the
tent
by
declining
dollars
just
because
they
were
whipped
in
after
meal
times
it
was
long
until
there
was
another
fellow
named
ed
collier
got
the
affliction
and
him
and
me
put
in
bridges
between
breakfast
and
dinner
and
dinner
and
supper
that
made
a
circus
of
that
tent
and
mame
turn
as
waiter
a
continuous
performance
that
collier
man
was
saturated
with
designs
and
contrivings
he
was
in
or
insurance
or
or
something
i
forgotten
which
he
was
a
man
well
lubricated
with
gentility
and
his
words
were
such
as
recommended
you
to
his
point
of
view
so
collier
and
me
infested
the
grub
tent
with
care
and
activity
mame
was
level
full
of
impartiality
was
like
a
casino
hand
the
way
she
dealt
out
her
favours
one
to
collier
and
one
to
me
and
one
to
the
board
and
not
a
card
up
her
sleeve
me
and
collier
naturally
got
acquainted
and
gravitated
together
some
on
the
outside
divested
of
his
stratagems
he
seemed
to
be
a
pleasant
chap
full
of
an
amiable
sort
of
hostility
notice
you
have
an
affinity
for
grubbing
in
the
banquet
hall
after
the
guests
have
fled
says
i
to
him
one
day
to
draw
his
conclusions
yes
says
collier
reflecting
tumult
of
a
crowded
board
seems
to
harass
my
sensitive
nerves
exasperates
mine
some
too
says
i
little
girl
do
you
think
see
says
collier
laughing
now
that
you
mention
it
i
have
noticed
that
she
does
seem
to
displease
the
optic
nerve
a
joy
to
mine
says
i
i
going
after
her
notice
is
hereby
served
be
as
candid
as
you
admits
collier
if
the
drug
stores
do
run
out
of
pepsin
i
give
you
a
run
for
your
money
leave
you
a
dyspeptic
at
the
so
collier
and
me
begins
the
race
the
grub
department
lays
in
new
supplies
mame
waits
on
us
jolly
and
kind
and
agreeable
and
it
looks
like
an
even
break
with
cupid
and
the
cook
working
overtime
in
dugan
restaurant
was
one
night
in
september
when
i
got
mame
to
take
a
walk
after
supper
when
the
things
were
all
cleared
away
we
strolled
out
a
distance
and
sat
on
a
pile
of
lumber
at
the
edge
of
town
such
opportunities
was
seldom
so
i
spoke
my
piece
explaining
how
the
brazilian
diamonds
and
the
fire
kindler
were
laying
up
sufficient
treasure
to
guarantee
the
happiness
of
two
and
that
both
of
together
could
equal
the
light
from
somebody
eyes
and
that
the
name
of
dugan
should
be
changed
to
peters
or
reasons
why
not
would
be
in
order
mame
did
say
anything
right
away
directly
she
gave
a
kind
of
shudder
and
i
began
to
learn
something
she
says
sorry
you
spoke
i
like
you
as
well
as
any
of
them
but
there
is
a
man
in
the
world
i
ever
marry
and
there
never
will
be
do
you
know
what
a
man
is
in
my
eye
he
a
tomb
a
sarcophagus
for
the
interment
of
andeggs
he
that
and
nothing
more
for
two
years
i
watched
men
eat
eat
eat
until
they
represent
nothing
on
earth
to
me
but
ruminant
bipeds
they
absolutely
nothing
but
something
that
goes
in
front
of
a
knife
and
fork
and
plate
at
the
table
they
fixed
that
way
in
my
mind
and
memory
i
tried
to
overcome
it
but
i
ca
i
heard
girls
rave
about
their
sweethearts
but
i
never
could
understand
it
a
man
and
a
sausage
grinder
and
a
pantry
awake
in
me
exactly
the
same
sentiments
i
went
to
a
matinee
once
to
see
an
actor
the
girls
were
crazy
about
i
got
interested
enough
to
wonder
whether
he
liked
his
steak
rare
medium
or
well
done
and
his
eggs
over
or
straight
up
that
was
all
no
jeff
i
marry
no
man
and
see
him
sit
at
the
breakfast
table
and
eat
and
come
back
to
dinner
and
eat
and
happen
in
again
at
supper
to
eat
eat
eat
mame
says
i
wear
off
you
had
too
much
of
it
you
marry
some
time
of
course
men
do
eat
always
far
as
my
observation
goes
they
do
no
i
tell
you
what
going
to
do
mame
turns
sudden
to
animation
and
bright
eyes
a
girl
named
susie
foster
in
terre
haute
a
chum
of
mine
she
waits
in
the
railroad
eating
house
there
i
worked
two
years
in
a
restaurant
in
that
town
susie
has
it
worse
than
i
do
because
the
men
who
eat
at
railroad
stations
gobble
they
try
to
flirt
and
gobble
at
the
same
time
whew
susie
and
i
have
it
all
planned
out
we
saving
our
money
and
when
we
get
enough
we
going
to
buy
a
little
cottage
and
five
acres
we
know
of
and
live
together
and
grow
violets
for
the
eastern
market
a
man
better
not
bring
his
appetite
within
a
mile
of
that
ranch
girls
ever
i
commenced
but
mame
heads
me
off
sharp
they
do
they
nibble
a
little
bit
sometimes
that
all
thought
the
confect
goodness
sake
change
the
subject
says
mame
as
i
said
before
that
experience
puts
me
wise
that
the
feminine
arrangement
ever
struggles
after
deceptions
and
illusions
take
england
beef
made
her
wieners
elevated
germany
uncle
sam
owes
his
greatness
to
fried
chicken
and
pie
but
the
young
ladies
of
the
shetalkyou
schools
they
never
believe
it
shakespeare
they
allow
and
rubinstein
and
the
rough
riders
is
what
did
the
trick
was
a
situation
calculated
to
disturb
i
could
bear
to
give
up
mame
and
yet
it
pained
me
to
think
of
abandoning
the
practice
of
eating
i
had
acquired
the
habit
too
early
for
years
i
had
been
blindly
rushing
upon
my
fate
yielding
to
the
insidious
lures
of
that
deadly
monster
food
it
was
too
late
i
was
a
ruminant
biped
for
keeps
it
was
lobster
salad
to
a
doughnut
that
my
life
was
going
to
be
blighted
by
it
i
continued
to
board
at
the
dugan
tent
hoping
that
mame
would
relent
i
had
sufficient
faith
in
true
love
to
believe
that
since
it
has
often
outlived
the
absence
of
a
square
meal
it
might
in
time
overcome
the
presence
of
one
i
went
on
ministering
to
my
fatal
vice
although
i
felt
that
each
time
i
shoved
a
potato
into
my
mouth
in
mame
presence
i
might
be
burying
my
fondest
hopes
i
think
collier
must
have
spoken
to
mame
and
got
the
same
answer
for
one
day
he
orders
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
cracker
and
sits
nibbling
the
corner
of
it
like
a
girl
in
the
parlour
that
filled
up
in
the
kitchen
previous
on
cold
roast
and
fried
cabbage
i
caught
on
and
did
the
same
and
maybe
we
thought
we
made
a
hit
the
next
day
we
tried
it
again
and
out
comes
old
man
dugan
fetching
in
his
hands
the
fairy
viands
off
yer
feed
ai
ye
gents
he
asks
fatherly
and
some
sardonic
i
spell
mame
a
bit
seein
the
work
was
light
and
my
rheumatiz
can
stand
the
strain
so
back
me
and
collier
had
to
drop
to
the
heavy
grub
again
i
noticed
about
that
time
that
i
was
seized
by
a
most
uncommon
and
devastating
appetite
i
ate
until
mame
must
have
hated
to
see
me
darken
the
door
afterward
i
found
out
that
i
had
been
made
the
victim
of
the
first
dark
and
irreligious
trick
played
on
me
by
ed
collier
him
and
me
had
been
taking
drinks
together
uptown
regular
trying
to
drown
our
thirst
for
food
that
man
had
bribed
about
ten
bartenders
to
always
put
a
big
slug
of
appletree
anaconda
appetite
bitters
in
every
one
of
my
drinks
but
the
last
trick
he
played
me
was
hardest
to
forget
one
day
collier
failed
to
show
up
at
the
tent
a
man
told
me
he
left
town
that
morning
my
only
rival
now
was
the
bill
of
fare
a
few
days
before
he
left
collier
had
presented
me
with
a
jug
of
fine
whisky
which
he
said
a
cousin
had
sent
him
from
kentucky
i
now
have
reason
to
believe
that
it
contained
appletree
anaconda
appetite
bitters
almost
exclusively
i
continued
to
devour
tons
of
provisions
in
mame
eyes
i
remained
a
mere
biped
more
ruminant
than
ever
about
a
week
after
collier
pulled
his
freight
there
came
a
kind
of
to
town
and
hoisted
a
tent
near
the
railroad
i
judged
it
was
a
sort
of
fake
museum
and
curiosity
business
i
called
to
see
mame
one
night
and
ma
dugan
said
that
she
and
thomas
her
younger
brother
had
gone
to
the
show
that
same
thing
happened
for
three
nights
that
week
saturday
night
i
caught
her
on
the
way
coming
back
and
got
to
sit
on
the
steps
a
while
and
talk
to
her
i
noticed
she
looked
different
her
eyes
were
softer
and
shiny
like
instead
of
a
mame
dugan
to
fly
from
the
voracity
of
man
and
raise
violets
she
seemed
to
be
a
mame
more
in
line
as
god
intended
her
approachable
and
suited
to
bask
in
the
light
of
the
brazilians
and
the
kindler
seem
to
be
right
smart
inveigled
says
i
the
unparalleled
exhibition
of
the
world
living
curiosities
and
wonders
a
change
says
mame
need
another
says
i
you
keep
on
going
every
night
be
cross
jeff
says
she
takes
my
mind
off
business
the
curiosities
eat
i
ask
all
of
them
some
of
them
are
wax
out
then
that
you
do
get
stuck
says
i
kind
of
flip
and
foolish
mame
blushed
i
did
know
what
to
think
about
her
my
hopes
raised
some
that
perhaps
my
attentions
had
palliated
man
awful
crime
of
visibly
introducing
nourishment
into
his
system
she
talked
some
about
the
stars
referring
to
them
with
respect
and
politeness
and
i
drivelled
a
quantity
about
united
hearts
homes
made
bright
by
true
affection
and
the
kindler
mame
listened
without
scorn
and
i
says
to
myself
old
man
you
removing
the
hoodoo
that
has
clung
to
the
consumer
of
victuals
you
setting
your
heel
upon
the
serpent
that
lurks
in
the
gravy
bowl
monday
night
i
drop
around
mame
is
at
the
unparalleled
exhibition
with
thomas
may
the
curse
of
the
sea
cooks
says
i
the
bad
luck
of
the
nine
impenitent
grasshoppers
rest
upon
this
sideshow
at
once
and
forever
more
amen
i
go
to
see
it
myself
night
and
investigate
its
baleful
charm
shall
man
that
was
made
to
inherit
the
earth
be
bereft
of
his
sweetheart
first
by
a
knife
and
fork
and
then
by
a
circus
the
next
night
before
starting
out
for
the
exhibition
tent
i
inquire
and
find
out
that
mame
is
not
at
home
she
is
not
at
the
circus
with
thomas
this
time
for
thomas
waylays
me
in
the
grass
outside
of
the
grub
tent
with
a
scheme
of
his
own
before
i
had
time
to
eat
supper
you
give
me
jeff
says
he
i
tell
you
something
value
of
it
son
i
says
is
stuck
on
a
freak
says
thomas
of
the
freaks
i
do
like
him
she
does
i
overheard
talking
thought
maybe
you
like
to
know
say
jeff
does
it
put
you
wise
two
worth
there
a
target
rifle
up
town
that
i
frisked
my
pockets
and
commenced
to
dribble
a
stream
of
halves
and
quarters
into
thomas
hat
the
information
was
of
the
system
of
news
and
it
telescoped
my
intellects
for
a
while
while
i
was
leaking
small
change
and
smiling
foolish
on
the
outside
and
suffering
disturbances
internally
i
was
saying
idiotically
and
pleasantly
you
thomas
thank
you
er
a
freak
you
said
thomas
now
could
you
make
out
the
monstrosity
entitlements
a
little
clearer
if
you
please
thomas
is
the
fellow
says
thomas
pulling
out
a
yellow
handbill
from
his
pocket
and
shoving
it
under
my
nose
the
champion
faster
of
the
universe
i
guess
that
why
sis
got
soft
on
him
he
do
eat
nothing
he
going
to
fast
days
this
is
the
sixth
him
i
looked
at
the
name
thomas
pointed
out
eduardo
collieri
says
i
in
admiration
not
so
bad
ed
collier
i
give
you
credit
for
the
trick
but
i
do
give
you
the
girl
until
she
mrs
freak
i
hit
the
sod
in
the
direction
of
the
show
i
came
up
to
the
rear
of
the
tent
and
as
i
did
so
a
man
wiggled
out
like
a
snake
from
under
the
bottom
of
the
canvas
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
ran
into
me
like
a
locoed
bronco
i
gathered
him
by
the
neck
and
investigated
him
by
the
light
of
the
stars
it
is
professor
eduardo
collieri
in
human
habiliments
with
a
desperate
look
in
one
eye
and
impatience
in
the
other
curiosity
says
i
still
a
minute
and
let
have
a
look
at
your
freakship
how
do
you
like
being
the
or
the
from
borneo
or
whatever
name
you
are
denounced
by
in
the
business
peters
says
collier
in
a
weak
voice
me
loose
or
slug
you
one
i
in
the
extremest
kind
of
a
large
hurry
hands
off
tut
eddie
i
answers
holding
him
hard
an
old
friend
gaze
on
the
exhibition
of
your
curiousness
it
an
eminent
graft
you
fell
onto
my
son
but
do
speak
of
assaults
and
battery
because
you
not
fit
the
best
you
got
is
a
lot
of
nerve
and
a
mighty
empty
stomach
and
so
it
was
the
man
was
as
weak
as
a
vegetarian
cat
argue
this
case
with
you
jeff
says
he
regretful
in
his
style
an
unlimited
number
of
rounds
if
i
had
half
an
hour
to
train
in
and
a
slab
of
beefsteak
two
feet
square
to
train
with
curse
the
man
i
say
that
invented
the
art
of
going
foodless
may
his
soul
in
eternity
be
chained
up
within
two
feet
of
a
bottomless
pit
of
hot
hash
i
abandoning
the
conflict
jeff
i
deserting
to
the
enemy
you
find
miss
dugan
inside
contemplating
the
only
living
mummy
and
the
informed
hog
she
a
fine
girl
jeff
i
have
beat
you
out
if
i
could
have
kept
up
the
grubless
habit
a
little
while
longer
you
have
to
admit
that
the
fasting
dodge
was
for
a
while
i
figured
it
out
that
way
but
say
jeff
it
said
that
love
makes
the
world
go
around
let
me
tell
you
the
announcement
lacks
verification
it
the
wind
from
the
dinner
horn
that
does
it
i
love
that
mame
dugan
i
gone
six
days
without
food
in
order
to
coincide
with
her
sentiments
only
one
bite
did
i
have
that
was
when
i
knocked
the
tattooed
man
down
with
a
war
club
and
got
a
sandwich
he
was
gobbling
the
manager
fined
me
all
my
salary
but
salary
was
what
i
was
after
was
that
girl
i
give
my
life
for
her
but
i
endanger
my
immortal
soul
for
a
beef
stew
hunger
is
a
horrible
thing
jeff
love
and
business
and
family
and
religion
and
art
and
patriotism
are
nothing
but
shadows
of
words
when
a
man
starving
in
such
language
ed
collier
discoursed
to
me
pathetic
i
gathered
the
diagnosis
that
his
affections
and
his
digestions
had
been
implicated
in
a
scramble
and
the
commissary
had
won
out
i
never
disliked
ed
collier
i
searched
my
internal
admonitions
of
suitable
etiquette
to
see
if
i
could
find
a
remark
of
a
consoling
nature
but
there
was
none
convenient
be
glad
now
says
ed
you
let
me
go
i
been
hard
hit
but
i
hit
the
ration
supply
harder
i
going
to
clean
out
every
restaurant
in
town
i
going
to
wade
waist
deep
in
sirloins
and
swim
in
ham
and
eggs
it
an
awful
thing
jeff
peters
for
a
man
to
come
to
this
pass
to
give
up
his
girl
for
something
to
eat
worse
than
that
man
esau
that
swapped
his
copyright
for
a
partridge
but
then
hunger
a
fierce
thing
you
excuse
me
now
jeff
for
i
smell
a
pervasion
of
ham
frying
in
the
distance
and
my
legs
are
crying
out
to
stampede
in
that
direction
hearty
meal
to
you
ed
collier
i
says
to
him
no
hard
feelings
for
myself
i
am
projected
to
be
an
unseldom
eater
and
i
have
condolence
for
your
predicaments
there
was
a
sudden
big
whiff
of
frying
ham
smell
on
the
breeze
and
the
champion
faster
gives
a
snort
and
gallops
off
in
the
dark
toward
fodder
i
wish
some
of
the
cultured
outfit
that
are
always
advertising
the
extenuating
circumstances
of
love
and
romance
had
been
there
to
see
there
was
ed
collier
a
fine
man
full
of
contrivances
and
flirtations
abandoning
the
girl
of
his
heart
and
ripping
out
into
the
contiguous
territory
in
the
pursuit
of
sordid
grub
was
a
rebuke
to
the
poets
and
a
slap
at
the
element
of
fiction
an
empty
stomach
is
a
sure
antidote
to
an
overfull
heart
i
was
naturally
anxious
to
know
how
far
mame
was
infatuated
with
collier
and
his
stratagems
i
went
inside
the
unparalleled
exhibition
and
there
she
was
she
looked
surprised
to
see
me
but
unguilty
an
elegant
evening
outside
says
i
coolness
is
quite
nice
and
gratifying
and
the
stars
are
lined
out
first
class
up
where
they
belong
would
you
shake
these
of
the
animal
kingdom
long
enough
to
take
a
walk
with
a
common
human
who
never
was
on
a
programme
in
his
life
mame
gave
a
sort
of
sly
glance
around
and
i
knew
what
that
meant
says
i
hate
to
tell
you
but
the
curiosity
that
lives
on
wind
has
flew
the
coop
he
just
crawled
out
under
the
tent
by
this
time
he
has
amalgamated
himself
with
half
the
delicatessen
truck
in
town
mean
ed
collier
says
mame
do
i
answers
a
pity
it
is
that
he
has
gone
back
to
crime
again
i
met
him
outside
the
tent
and
he
exposed
his
intentions
of
devastating
the
food
crop
of
the
world
is
enormously
sad
when
ideal
descends
from
his
pedestal
to
make
a
locust
of
himself
mame
looked
me
straight
in
the
eye
until
she
had
corkscrewed
my
reflections
says
she
is
quite
like
you
to
talk
that
way
i
care
to
hear
ed
collier
ridiculed
a
man
may
do
ridiculous
things
but
they
do
look
ridiculous
to
the
girl
he
does
for
that
was
one
man
in
a
hundred
he
stopped
eating
just
to
please
me
i
be
hearted
and
ungrateful
if
i
did
feel
kindly
toward
him
could
you
do
what
he
did
know
says
i
seeing
the
point
condemned
i
ca
help
it
the
brand
of
the
consumer
is
upon
my
brow
eve
settled
that
business
for
me
when
she
made
the
dicker
with
the
snake
i
fell
from
the
fire
into
the
i
guess
i
the
champion
feaster
of
the
universe
i
spoke
humble
and
mame
mollified
herself
a
little
collier
and
i
are
good
friends
she
said
same
as
me
and
you
i
gave
him
the
same
answer
i
did
you
no
marrying
for
me
i
liked
to
be
with
ed
and
talk
with
him
there
was
something
mighty
pleasant
to
me
in
the
thought
that
here
was
a
man
who
never
used
a
knife
and
fork
and
all
for
my
sake
you
in
love
with
him
i
asks
all
injudicious
there
a
deal
on
for
you
to
become
mrs
curiosity
all
of
us
do
it
sometimes
all
of
us
get
jostled
out
of
the
line
of
profitable
talk
now
and
then
mame
put
on
that
little
lemon
smile
that
runs
between
ice
and
sugar
and
says
much
too
pleasant
short
on
credentials
for
asking
that
question
peters
suppose
you
do
a
day
fast
just
to
give
you
ground
to
stand
on
and
then
maybe
i
answer
it
so
even
after
collier
was
kidnapped
out
of
the
way
by
the
revolt
of
his
appetite
my
own
prospects
with
mame
did
seem
to
be
improved
and
then
business
played
out
in
guthrie
i
had
stayed
too
long
there
the
brazilians
i
had
sold
commenced
to
show
signs
of
wear
and
the
kindler
refused
to
light
up
right
frequent
on
wet
mornings
there
is
always
a
time
in
my
business
when
the
star
of
success
says
on
to
the
next
town
i
was
travelling
by
wagon
at
that
time
so
as
not
to
miss
any
of
the
small
towns
so
i
hitched
up
a
few
days
later
and
went
down
to
tell
mame
i
abandoning
the
game
i
intended
running
over
to
oklahoma
city
and
work
it
for
a
week
or
two
then
i
was
coming
back
to
institute
fresh
proceedings
against
mame
what
do
i
find
at
the
dugans
but
mame
all
conspicuous
in
a
blue
travelling
dress
with
her
little
trunk
at
the
door
it
seems
that
sister
lottie
bell
who
is
a
typewriter
in
terre
haute
is
going
to
be
married
next
thursday
and
mame
is
off
for
a
week
visit
to
be
an
accomplice
at
the
ceremony
mame
is
waiting
for
a
freight
wagon
that
is
going
to
take
her
to
oklahoma
but
i
condemns
the
freight
wagon
with
promptness
and
scorn
and
offers
to
deliver
the
goods
myself
ma
dugan
sees
no
reason
why
not
as
mr
freighter
wants
pay
for
the
job
so
thirty
minutes
later
mame
and
i
pull
out
in
my
light
spring
wagon
with
white
canvas
cover
and
head
due
south
that
morning
was
of
a
praiseworthy
sort
the
breeze
was
lively
and
smelled
excellent
of
flowers
and
grass
and
the
little
cottontail
rabbits
entertained
themselves
with
skylarking
across
the
road
my
two
kentucky
bays
went
for
the
horizon
until
it
come
sailing
in
so
fast
you
wanted
to
dodge
it
like
a
clothesline
mame
was
full
of
talk
and
rattled
on
like
a
kid
about
her
old
home
and
her
school
pranks
and
the
things
she
liked
and
the
hateful
ways
of
those
johnson
girls
just
across
the
street
up
in
indiana
not
a
word
was
said
about
ed
collier
or
victuals
or
such
solemn
subjects
about
noon
mame
looks
and
finds
that
the
lunch
she
had
put
up
in
a
basket
had
been
left
behind
i
could
have
managed
quite
a
collation
but
mame
did
seem
to
be
grieving
over
nothing
to
eat
so
i
made
no
lamentations
it
was
a
sore
subject
with
me
and
i
ruled
provender
in
all
its
branches
out
of
my
conversation
i
am
minded
to
touch
light
on
explanations
how
i
came
to
lose
the
way
the
road
was
dim
and
well
grown
with
grass
and
there
was
mame
by
my
side
confiscating
my
intellects
and
attention
the
excuses
are
good
or
they
are
not
as
they
may
appear
to
you
but
i
lost
it
and
at
dusk
that
afternoon
when
we
should
have
been
in
oklahoma
city
we
were
seesawing
along
the
edge
of
nowhere
in
some
undiscovered
river
bottom
and
the
rain
was
falling
in
large
wet
bunches
down
there
in
the
swamps
we
saw
a
little
log
house
on
a
small
knoll
of
high
ground
the
bottom
grass
and
the
chaparral
and
the
lonesome
timber
crowded
all
around
it
it
seemed
to
be
a
melancholy
little
house
and
you
felt
sorry
for
it
was
that
house
for
the
night
the
way
i
reasoned
it
i
explained
to
mame
and
she
leaves
it
to
me
to
decide
she
become
galvanic
and
prosecuting
as
most
women
would
but
she
says
it
all
right
she
knows
i
did
mean
to
do
it
we
found
the
house
was
deserted
it
had
two
empty
rooms
there
was
a
little
shed
in
the
yard
where
beasts
had
once
been
kept
in
a
loft
of
it
was
a
lot
of
old
hay
i
put
my
horses
in
there
and
gave
them
some
of
it
for
which
they
looked
at
me
sorrowful
expecting
apologies
the
rest
of
the
hay
i
carried
into
the
house
by
armfuls
with
a
view
to
accommodations
i
also
brought
in
the
patent
kindler
and
the
brazilians
neither
of
which
are
guaranteed
against
the
action
of
water
mame
and
i
sat
on
the
wagon
seats
on
the
floor
and
i
lit
a
lot
of
the
kindler
on
the
hearth
for
the
night
was
chilly
if
i
was
any
judge
that
girl
enjoyed
it
it
was
a
change
for
her
it
gave
her
a
different
point
of
view
she
laughed
and
talked
and
the
kindler
made
a
dim
light
compared
to
her
eyes
i
had
a
pocketful
of
cigars
and
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
there
had
never
been
any
fall
of
man
we
were
at
the
same
old
stand
in
the
garden
of
eden
out
there
somewhere
in
the
rain
and
the
dark
was
the
river
of
zion
and
the
angel
with
the
flaming
sword
had
not
yet
put
up
the
sign
i
opened
up
a
gross
or
two
of
the
brazilians
and
made
mame
put
them
on
rings
brooches
necklaces
eardrops
bracelets
girdles
and
lockets
she
flashed
and
sparkled
like
a
princess
until
she
had
pink
spots
in
her
cheeks
and
almost
cried
for
a
when
it
got
late
i
made
a
fine
bunk
on
the
floor
for
mame
with
the
hay
and
my
lap
robes
and
blankets
out
of
the
wagon
and
persuaded
her
to
lie
down
i
sat
in
the
other
room
burning
tobacco
and
listening
to
the
pouring
rain
and
meditating
on
the
many
vicissitudes
that
came
to
a
man
during
the
seventy
years
or
so
immediately
preceding
his
funeral
i
must
have
dozed
a
little
while
before
morning
for
my
eyes
were
shut
and
when
i
opened
them
it
was
daylight
and
there
stood
mame
with
her
hair
all
done
up
neat
and
correct
and
her
eyes
bright
with
admiration
of
existence
whiz
jeff
she
exclaims
i
hungry
i
could
eat
a
i
looked
up
and
caught
her
eye
her
smile
went
back
in
and
she
gave
me
a
cold
look
of
suspicion
then
i
laughed
and
laid
down
on
the
floor
to
laugh
easier
it
seemed
funny
to
me
by
nature
and
geniality
i
am
a
hearty
laugher
and
i
went
the
limit
when
i
came
to
mame
was
sitting
with
her
back
to
me
all
contaminated
with
dignity
be
angry
mame
i
says
i
could
help
it
it
the
funny
way
you
done
up
your
hair
if
you
could
only
see
it
need
tell
stories
sir
said
mame
cool
and
advised
hair
is
all
right
i
know
what
you
were
laughing
about
why
jeff
look
outside
she
winds
up
peeping
through
a
chink
between
the
logs
i
opened
the
little
wooden
window
and
looked
out
the
entire
river
bottom
was
flooded
and
the
knob
of
land
on
which
the
house
stood
was
an
island
in
the
middle
of
a
rushing
stream
of
yellow
water
a
hundred
yards
wide
and
it
was
still
raining
hard
all
we
could
do
was
to
stay
there
till
the
doves
brought
in
the
olive
branch
i
am
bound
to
admit
that
conversations
and
amusements
languished
during
that
day
i
was
aware
that
mame
was
getting
a
too
prolonged
view
of
things
again
but
i
had
no
way
to
change
it
personally
i
was
wrapped
up
in
the
desire
to
eat
i
had
hallucinations
of
hash
and
visions
of
ham
and
i
kept
saying
to
myself
all
the
time
you
have
to
eat
jeff
what
you
order
now
old
man
when
the
waiter
comes
i
picks
out
to
myself
all
sorts
of
favourites
from
the
bill
of
fare
and
imagines
them
coming
i
guess
it
that
way
with
all
hungry
men
they
ca
get
their
cogitations
trained
on
anything
but
something
to
eat
it
shows
that
the
little
table
with
the
caster
and
the
imitation
worcester
sauce
and
the
napkin
covering
up
the
coffee
stains
is
the
paramount
issue
after
all
instead
of
the
question
of
immortality
or
peace
between
nations
i
sat
there
musing
along
arguing
with
myself
quite
heated
as
to
how
i
have
my
steak
with
mushrooms
or
la
mame
was
on
the
other
seat
pensive
her
head
leaning
on
her
hand
the
potatoes
come
i
states
in
my
mind
brown
the
hash
in
the
pan
with
nine
poached
eggs
on
the
side
i
felt
careful
in
my
own
pockets
to
see
if
i
could
find
a
peanut
or
a
grain
or
two
of
popcorn
night
came
on
again
with
the
river
still
rising
and
the
rain
still
falling
i
looked
at
mame
and
i
noticed
that
desperate
look
on
her
face
that
a
girl
always
wears
when
she
passes
an
lair
i
knew
that
poor
girl
was
hungry
maybe
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
there
was
that
anxious
look
in
her
eye
that
a
woman
has
only
when
she
has
missed
a
meal
or
feels
her
skirt
coming
unfastened
in
the
back
it
was
about
eleven
or
so
on
the
second
night
when
we
sat
gloomy
in
our
shipwrecked
cabin
i
kept
jerking
my
mind
away
from
the
subject
of
food
but
it
kept
flopping
back
again
before
i
could
fasten
it
i
thought
of
everything
good
to
eat
i
had
ever
heard
of
i
went
away
back
to
my
kidhood
and
remembered
the
hot
biscuit
sopped
in
sorghum
and
bacon
gravy
with
partiality
and
respect
then
i
trailed
along
up
the
years
pausing
at
green
apples
and
salt
flapjacks
and
maple
lye
hominy
fried
chicken
old
virginia
style
corn
on
the
cob
spareribs
and
sweet
potato
pie
and
wound
up
with
georgia
brunswick
stew
which
is
the
top
notch
of
good
things
to
eat
because
it
comprises
all
they
say
a
drowning
man
sees
a
panorama
of
his
whole
life
pass
before
him
well
when
a
man
starving
he
sees
the
ghost
of
every
meal
he
ever
ate
set
out
before
him
and
he
invents
new
dishes
that
would
make
the
fortune
of
a
chef
if
somebody
would
collect
the
last
words
of
men
who
starved
to
death
they
have
to
sift
mighty
fine
to
discover
the
sentiment
but
they
compile
into
a
cook
book
that
would
sell
into
the
millions
i
guess
i
must
have
had
my
conscience
pretty
well
inflicted
with
culinary
meditations
for
without
intending
to
do
so
i
says
out
loud
to
the
imaginary
waiter
it
thick
and
have
it
rare
with
the
french
fried
and
six
on
toast
mame
turned
her
head
quick
as
a
wing
her
eyes
were
sparkling
and
she
smiled
sudden
for
me
she
rattles
out
the
juliennes
and
three
straight
up
draw
one
and
brown
the
wheats
double
order
to
come
oh
jeff
would
it
be
glorious
and
then
i
like
to
have
a
half
fry
and
a
little
chicken
curried
with
rice
and
a
cup
custard
with
ice
cream
and
easy
i
interrupts
the
chicken
liver
pie
and
the
kidney
on
toast
and
the
roast
lamb
and
cuts
in
mame
all
excited
mint
sauce
and
the
turkey
salad
and
stuffed
olives
and
raspberry
tarts
and
it
going
says
i
up
with
the
fried
squash
and
the
hot
corn
pone
with
sweet
milk
and
do
forget
the
apple
dumpling
with
hard
sauce
and
the
pie
yes
for
ten
minutes
we
kept
up
that
kind
of
restaurant
repartee
we
ranges
up
and
down
and
backward
and
forward
over
the
main
trunk
lines
and
the
branches
of
the
victual
subject
and
mame
leads
the
game
for
she
is
apprised
in
the
ramifications
of
grub
and
the
dishes
she
nominates
aggravates
my
yearnings
it
seems
that
there
is
a
feeling
that
mame
will
line
up
friendly
again
with
food
it
seems
that
she
looks
upon
the
obnoxious
science
of
eating
with
less
contempt
than
before
the
next
morning
we
find
that
the
flood
has
subsided
i
geared
up
the
bays
and
we
splashed
out
through
the
mud
some
precarious
until
we
found
the
road
again
we
were
only
a
few
miles
wrong
and
in
two
hours
we
were
in
oklahoma
city
the
first
thing
we
saw
was
a
big
restaurant
sign
and
we
piled
into
there
in
a
hurry
here
i
finds
myself
sitting
with
mame
at
table
with
knives
and
forks
and
plates
between
us
and
she
not
scornful
but
smiling
with
starvation
and
sweetness
was
a
new
restaurant
and
well
stocked
i
designated
a
list
of
quotations
from
the
bill
of
fare
that
made
the
waiter
look
out
toward
the
wagon
to
see
how
many
more
might
be
coming
there
we
were
and
there
was
the
order
being
served
was
a
banquet
for
a
dozen
but
we
felt
like
a
dozen
i
looked
across
the
table
at
mame
and
smiled
for
i
had
recollections
mame
was
looking
at
the
table
like
a
boy
looks
at
his
first
then
she
looked
at
me
straight
in
the
face
and
two
big
tears
came
in
her
eyes
the
waiter
was
gone
after
more
grub
she
says
soft
like
been
a
foolish
girl
i
looked
at
things
from
the
wrong
side
i
never
felt
this
way
before
men
get
hungry
every
day
like
this
do
they
they
big
and
strong
and
they
do
the
hard
work
of
the
world
and
they
do
eat
just
to
spite
silly
waiter
girls
in
restaurants
do
they
jeff
you
said
once
that
is
you
asked
me
you
wanted
me
to
well
jeff
if
you
still
care
be
glad
and
willing
to
have
you
always
sitting
across
the
table
from
me
now
give
me
something
to
eat
quick
please
so
as
i
said
a
woman
needs
to
change
her
point
of
view
now
and
then
they
get
tired
of
the
same
old
sights
the
same
old
dinner
table
washtub
and
sewing
machine
give
a
touch
of
the
various
a
little
travel
and
a
little
rest
a
little
tomfoolery
along
with
the
tragedies
of
keeping
house
a
little
petting
after
the
a
little
upsetting
and
a
little
jostling
around
and
everybody
in
the
game
will
have
chips
added
to
their
stack
by
the
play
xi
the
caballero
way
the
cisco
kid
had
killed
six
men
in
more
or
less
fair
scrimmages
had
murdered
twice
as
many
mostly
mexicans
and
had
winged
a
larger
number
whom
he
modestly
forbore
to
count
therefore
a
woman
loved
him
the
kid
was
looked
twenty
and
a
careful
insurance
company
would
have
estimated
the
probable
time
of
his
demise
at
say
his
habitat
was
anywhere
between
the
frio
and
the
rio
grande
he
killed
for
the
love
of
it
because
he
was
to
avoid
arrest
for
his
own
amusement
any
reason
that
came
to
his
mind
would
suffice
he
had
escaped
capture
because
he
could
shoot
of
a
second
sooner
than
any
sheriff
or
ranger
in
the
service
and
because
he
rode
a
speckled
roan
horse
that
knew
every
in
the
mesquite
and
pear
thickets
from
san
antonio
to
matamoras
tonia
perez
the
girl
who
loved
the
cisco
kid
was
half
carmen
half
madonna
and
the
rest
oh
yes
a
woman
who
is
half
carmen
and
half
madonna
can
always
be
something
more
the
rest
let
us
say
was
she
lived
in
a
near
a
little
mexican
settlement
at
the
lone
wolf
crossing
of
the
frio
with
her
lived
a
father
or
grandfather
a
lineal
aztec
somewhat
less
than
a
thousand
years
old
who
herded
a
hundred
goats
and
lived
in
a
continuous
drunken
dream
from
drinking
back
of
the
a
tremendous
forest
of
bristling
pear
twenty
feet
high
at
its
worst
crowded
almost
to
its
door
it
was
along
the
bewildering
maze
of
this
spinous
thicket
that
the
speckled
roan
would
bring
the
kid
to
see
his
girl
and
once
clinging
like
a
lizard
to
the
high
up
under
the
peaked
grass
roof
he
had
heard
tonia
with
her
madonna
face
and
carmen
beauty
and
soul
parley
with
the
posse
denying
knowledge
of
her
man
in
her
soft
of
spanish
and
english
one
day
the
of
the
state
who
is
commander
of
the
ranger
forces
wrote
some
sarcastic
lines
to
captain
duval
of
company
x
stationed
at
laredo
relative
to
the
serene
and
undisturbed
existence
led
by
murderers
and
desperadoes
in
the
said
captain
territory
the
captain
turned
the
colour
of
brick
dust
under
his
tan
and
forwarded
the
letter
after
adding
a
few
comments
per
ranger
private
bill
adamson
to
ranger
lieutenant
sandridge
camped
at
a
water
hole
on
the
nueces
with
a
squad
of
five
men
in
preservation
of
law
and
order
lieutenant
sandridge
turned
a
beautiful
de
through
his
ordinary
strawberry
complexion
tucked
the
letter
in
his
hip
pocket
and
chewed
off
the
ends
of
his
gamboge
moustache
the
next
morning
he
saddled
his
horse
and
rode
alone
to
the
mexican
settlement
at
the
lone
wolf
crossing
of
the
frio
twenty
miles
away
six
feet
two
blond
as
a
viking
quiet
as
a
deacon
dangerous
as
a
machine
gun
sandridge
moved
among
the
patiently
seeking
news
of
the
cisco
kid
far
more
than
the
law
the
mexicans
dreaded
the
cold
and
certain
vengeance
of
the
lone
rider
that
the
ranger
sought
it
had
been
one
of
the
kid
pastimes
to
shoot
mexicans
to
see
them
kick
if
he
demanded
from
them
moribund
terpsichorean
feats
simply
that
he
might
be
entertained
what
terrible
and
extreme
penalties
would
be
certain
to
follow
should
they
anger
him
one
and
all
they
lounged
with
upturned
palms
and
shrugging
shoulders
filling
the
air
with
and
denials
of
the
kid
acquaintance
but
there
was
a
man
named
fink
who
kept
a
store
at
the
crossing
a
man
of
many
nationalities
tongues
interests
and
ways
of
thinking
no
use
to
ask
them
mexicans
he
said
to
sandridge
they
afraid
to
tell
this
they
call
the
kid
goodall
is
his
name
it
he
been
in
my
store
once
or
twice
i
have
an
idea
you
might
run
across
him
at
but
i
guess
i
do
keer
to
say
myself
i
two
seconds
later
in
pulling
a
gun
than
i
used
to
be
and
the
difference
is
worth
thinking
about
but
this
kid
got
a
girl
at
the
crossing
that
he
comes
to
see
she
lives
in
that
a
hundred
yards
down
the
arroyo
at
the
edge
of
the
pear
maybe
she
no
i
suppose
she
would
but
that
would
be
a
good
place
to
watch
anyway
sandridge
rode
down
to
the
of
perez
the
sun
was
low
and
the
broad
shade
of
the
great
pear
thicket
already
covered
the
thatched
hut
the
goats
were
enclosed
for
the
night
in
a
brush
corral
near
by
a
few
kids
walked
the
top
of
it
nibbling
the
chaparral
leaves
the
old
mexican
lay
upon
a
blanket
on
the
grass
already
in
a
stupor
from
his
mescal
and
dreaming
perhaps
of
the
nights
when
he
and
pizarro
touched
glasses
to
their
new
world
fortunes
so
old
his
wrinkled
face
seemed
to
proclaim
him
to
be
and
in
the
door
of
the
stood
tonia
and
lieutenant
sandridge
sat
in
his
saddle
staring
at
her
like
a
gannet
agape
at
a
sailorman
the
cisco
kid
was
a
vain
person
as
all
eminent
and
successful
assassins
are
and
his
bosom
would
have
been
ruffled
had
he
known
that
at
a
simple
exchange
of
glances
two
persons
in
whose
minds
he
had
been
looming
large
suddenly
abandoned
at
least
for
the
time
all
thought
of
him
never
before
had
tonia
seen
such
a
man
as
this
he
seemed
to
be
made
of
sunshine
and
tissue
and
clear
weather
he
seemed
to
illuminate
the
shadow
of
the
pear
when
he
smiled
as
though
the
sun
were
rising
again
the
men
she
had
known
had
been
small
and
dark
even
the
kid
in
spite
of
his
achievements
was
a
stripling
no
larger
than
herself
with
black
straight
hair
and
a
cold
marble
face
that
chilled
the
noonday
as
for
tonia
though
she
sends
description
to
the
poorhouse
let
her
make
a
millionaire
of
your
fancy
her
hair
smoothly
divided
in
the
middle
and
bound
close
to
her
head
and
her
large
eyes
full
of
the
latin
melancholy
gave
her
the
madonna
touch
her
motions
and
air
spoke
of
the
concealed
fire
and
the
desire
to
charm
that
she
had
inherited
from
the
of
the
basque
province
as
for
the
part
of
her
that
dwelt
in
her
heart
you
could
not
perceive
it
unless
her
bright
red
skirt
and
dark
blue
blouse
gave
you
a
symbolic
hint
of
the
vagarious
bird
the
newly
lighted
asked
for
a
drink
of
water
tonia
brought
it
from
the
red
jar
hanging
under
the
brush
shelter
sandridge
considered
it
necessary
to
dismount
so
as
to
lessen
the
trouble
of
her
ministrations
i
play
no
spy
nor
do
i
assume
to
master
the
thoughts
of
any
human
heart
but
i
assert
by
the
chronicler
right
that
before
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
sped
sandridge
was
teaching
her
how
to
plaint
a
rawhide
and
tonia
had
explained
to
him
that
were
it
not
for
her
little
english
book
that
the
peripatetic
had
given
her
and
the
little
crippled
that
she
fed
from
a
bottle
she
would
be
very
very
lonely
indeed
which
leads
to
a
suspicion
that
the
kid
fences
needed
repairing
and
that
the
sarcasm
had
fallen
upon
unproductive
soil
in
his
camp
by
the
water
hole
lieutenant
sandridge
announced
and
reiterated
his
intention
of
either
causing
the
cisco
kid
to
nibble
the
black
loam
of
the
frio
country
prairies
or
of
haling
him
before
a
judge
and
jury
that
sounded
twice
a
week
he
rode
over
to
the
lone
wolf
crossing
of
the
frio
and
directed
tonia
slim
slightly
fingers
among
the
intricacies
of
the
slowly
growing
lariata
a
plait
is
hard
to
learn
and
easy
to
teach
the
ranger
knew
that
he
might
find
the
kid
there
at
any
visit
he
kept
his
armament
ready
and
had
a
frequent
eye
for
the
pear
thicket
at
the
rear
of
the
thus
he
might
bring
down
the
kite
and
the
with
one
stone
while
the
ornithologist
was
pursuing
his
studies
the
cisco
kid
was
also
attending
to
his
professional
duties
he
moodily
shot
up
a
saloon
in
a
small
cow
village
on
quintana
creek
killed
the
town
marshal
plugging
him
neatly
in
the
centre
of
his
tin
badge
and
then
rode
away
morose
and
unsatisfied
no
true
artist
is
uplifted
by
shooting
an
aged
man
carrying
an
bulldog
on
his
way
the
kid
suddenly
experienced
the
yearning
that
all
men
feel
when
loses
its
keen
edge
of
delight
he
yearned
for
the
woman
he
loved
to
reassure
him
that
she
was
his
in
spite
of
it
he
wanted
her
to
call
his
bloodthirstiness
bravery
and
his
cruelty
devotion
he
wanted
tonia
to
bring
him
water
from
the
red
jar
under
the
brush
shelter
and
tell
him
how
the
was
thriving
on
the
bottle
the
kid
turned
the
speckled
roan
head
up
the
pear
flat
that
stretches
along
the
arroyo
hondo
until
it
ends
at
the
lone
wolf
crossing
of
the
frio
the
roan
whickered
for
he
had
a
sense
of
locality
and
direction
equal
to
that
of
a
horse
and
he
knew
he
would
soon
be
nibbling
the
rich
mesquite
grass
at
the
end
of
a
while
ulysses
rested
his
head
in
circe
hut
more
weird
and
lonesome
than
the
journey
of
an
amazonian
explorer
is
the
ride
of
one
through
a
texas
pear
flat
with
dismal
monotony
and
startling
variety
the
uncanny
and
multiform
shapes
of
the
cacti
lift
their
twisted
trunks
and
fat
bristly
hands
to
encumber
the
way
the
demon
plant
appearing
to
live
without
soil
or
rain
seems
to
taunt
the
parched
traveller
with
its
lush
grey
greenness
it
warps
itself
a
thousand
times
about
what
look
to
be
open
and
inviting
paths
only
to
lure
the
rider
into
blind
and
impassable
bottoms
of
the
bag
leaving
him
to
retreat
if
he
can
with
the
points
of
the
compass
whirling
in
his
head
to
be
lost
in
the
pear
is
to
die
almost
the
death
of
the
thief
on
the
cross
pierced
by
nails
and
with
grotesque
shapes
of
all
the
fiends
hovering
about
but
it
was
not
so
with
the
kid
and
his
mount
winding
twisting
circling
tracing
the
most
fantastic
and
bewildering
trail
ever
picked
out
the
good
roan
lessened
the
distance
to
the
lone
wolf
crossing
with
every
coil
and
turn
that
he
made
while
they
fared
the
kid
sang
he
knew
but
one
tune
and
sang
it
as
he
knew
but
one
code
and
lived
it
and
but
one
girl
and
loved
her
he
was
a
man
of
conventional
ideas
he
had
a
voice
like
a
coyote
with
bronchitis
but
whenever
he
chose
to
sing
his
song
he
sang
it
it
was
a
conventional
song
of
the
camps
and
trail
running
at
its
beginning
as
near
as
may
be
to
these
words
do
you
monkey
with
my
lulu
girl
or
i
tell
you
what
i
do
and
so
on
the
roan
was
inured
to
it
and
did
not
mind
but
even
the
poorest
singer
will
after
a
certain
time
gain
his
own
consent
to
refrain
from
contributing
to
the
world
noises
so
the
kid
by
the
time
he
was
within
a
mile
or
two
of
tonia
had
reluctantly
allowed
his
song
to
die
away
not
because
his
vocal
performance
had
become
less
charming
to
his
own
ears
but
because
his
laryngeal
muscles
were
aweary
as
though
he
were
in
a
circus
ring
the
speckled
roan
wheeled
and
danced
through
the
labyrinth
of
pear
until
at
length
his
rider
knew
by
certain
landmarks
that
the
lone
wolf
crossing
was
close
at
hand
then
where
the
pear
was
thinner
he
caught
sight
of
the
grass
roof
of
the
and
the
hackberry
tree
on
the
edge
of
the
arroyo
a
few
yards
farther
the
kid
stopped
the
roan
and
gazed
intently
through
the
prickly
openings
then
he
dismounted
dropped
the
roan
reins
and
proceeded
on
foot
stooping
and
silent
like
an
indian
the
roan
knowing
his
part
stood
still
making
no
sound
the
kid
crept
noiselessly
to
the
very
edge
of
the
pear
thicket
and
reconnoitred
between
the
leaves
of
a
clump
of
cactus
ten
yards
from
his
in
the
shade
of
the
sat
his
tonia
calmly
plaiting
a
rawhide
lariat
so
far
she
might
surely
escape
condemnation
women
have
been
known
from
time
to
time
to
engage
in
more
mischievous
occupations
but
if
all
must
be
told
there
is
to
be
added
that
her
head
reposed
against
the
broad
and
comfortable
chest
of
a
tall
man
and
that
his
arm
was
about
her
guiding
her
nimble
fingers
that
required
so
many
lessons
at
the
intricate
strand
plait
sandridge
glanced
quickly
at
the
dark
mass
of
pear
when
he
heard
a
slight
squeaking
sound
that
was
not
altogether
unfamiliar
a
scabbard
will
make
that
sound
when
one
grasps
the
handle
of
a
shooter
suddenly
but
the
sound
was
not
repeated
and
tonia
fingers
needed
close
attention
and
then
in
the
shadow
of
death
they
began
to
talk
of
their
love
and
in
the
still
july
afternoon
every
word
they
uttered
reached
the
ears
of
the
kid
remember
then
said
tonia
you
must
not
come
again
until
i
send
for
you
soon
he
will
be
here
a
at
the
said
he
saw
him
on
the
guadalupe
three
days
ago
when
he
is
that
near
he
always
comes
if
he
comes
and
finds
you
here
he
will
kill
you
so
for
my
sake
you
must
come
no
more
until
i
send
you
the
word
all
right
said
the
stranger
and
then
what
and
then
said
the
girl
you
must
bring
your
men
here
and
kill
him
if
not
he
will
kill
you
he
ai
a
man
to
surrender
that
sure
said
sandridge
it
kill
or
be
killed
for
the
officer
that
goes
up
against
cisco
kid
he
must
die
said
the
girl
otherwise
there
will
not
be
any
peace
in
the
world
for
thee
and
me
he
has
killed
many
let
him
so
die
bring
your
men
and
give
him
no
chance
to
escape
you
used
to
think
right
much
of
him
said
sandridge
tonia
dropped
the
lariat
twisted
herself
around
and
curved
a
tinted
arm
over
the
ranger
shoulder
but
then
she
murmured
in
liquid
spanish
i
had
not
beheld
thee
thou
great
red
mountain
of
a
man
and
thou
art
kind
and
good
as
well
as
strong
could
one
choose
him
knowing
thee
let
him
die
for
then
i
will
not
be
filled
with
fear
by
day
and
night
lest
he
hurt
thee
or
me
how
can
i
know
when
he
comes
asked
sandridge
when
he
comes
said
tonia
he
remains
two
days
sometimes
three
gregorio
the
small
son
of
old
luisa
the
has
a
swift
pony
i
will
write
a
letter
to
thee
and
send
it
by
him
saying
how
it
will
be
best
to
come
upon
him
by
gregorio
will
the
letter
come
and
bring
many
men
with
thee
and
have
much
care
oh
dear
red
one
for
the
rattlesnake
is
not
quicker
to
strike
than
is
as
they
call
him
to
send
a
ball
from
his
the
kid
handy
with
his
gun
sure
enough
admitted
sandridge
but
when
i
come
for
him
i
shall
come
alone
i
get
him
by
myself
or
not
at
all
the
cap
wrote
one
or
two
things
to
me
that
make
me
want
to
do
the
trick
without
any
help
you
let
me
know
when
mr
kid
arrives
and
i
do
the
rest
i
will
send
you
the
message
by
the
boy
gregorio
said
the
girl
i
knew
you
were
braver
than
that
small
slayer
of
men
who
never
smiles
how
could
i
ever
have
thought
i
cared
for
him
it
was
time
for
the
ranger
to
ride
back
to
his
camp
on
the
water
hole
before
he
mounted
his
horse
he
raised
the
slight
form
of
tonia
with
one
arm
high
from
the
earth
for
a
parting
salute
the
drowsy
stillness
of
the
torpid
summer
air
still
lay
thick
upon
the
dreaming
afternoon
the
smoke
from
the
fire
in
the
where
the
blubbered
in
the
iron
pot
rose
straight
as
a
above
the
chimney
no
sound
or
movement
disturbed
the
serenity
of
the
dense
pear
thicket
ten
yards
away
when
the
form
of
sandridge
had
disappeared
loping
his
big
dun
down
the
steep
banks
of
the
frio
crossing
the
kid
crept
back
to
his
own
horse
mounted
him
and
rode
back
along
the
tortuous
trail
he
had
come
but
not
far
he
stopped
and
waited
in
the
silent
depths
of
the
pear
until
half
an
hour
had
passed
and
then
tonia
heard
the
high
untrue
notes
of
his
unmusical
singing
coming
nearer
and
nearer
and
she
ran
to
the
edge
of
the
pear
to
meet
him
the
kid
seldom
smiled
but
he
smiled
and
waved
his
hat
when
he
saw
her
he
dismounted
and
his
girl
sprang
into
his
arms
the
kid
looked
at
her
fondly
his
thick
black
hair
clung
to
his
head
like
a
wrinkled
mat
the
meeting
brought
a
slight
ripple
of
some
undercurrent
of
feeling
to
his
smooth
dark
face
that
was
usually
as
motionless
as
a
clay
mask
how
my
girl
he
asked
holding
her
close
sick
of
waiting
so
long
for
you
dear
one
she
answered
my
eyes
are
dim
with
always
gazing
into
that
devil
pincushion
through
which
you
come
and
i
can
see
into
it
such
a
little
way
too
but
you
are
here
beloved
one
and
i
will
not
scold
mal
not
to
come
to
see
your
more
often
go
in
and
rest
and
let
me
water
your
horse
and
stake
him
with
the
long
rope
there
is
cool
water
in
the
jar
for
you
the
kid
kissed
her
affectionately
not
if
the
court
knows
itself
do
i
let
a
lady
stake
my
horse
for
me
said
he
but
if
you
run
in
and
throw
a
pot
of
coffee
together
while
i
attend
to
the
i
be
a
good
deal
obliged
besides
his
marksmanship
the
kid
had
another
attribute
for
which
he
admired
himself
greatly
he
was
as
the
mexicans
express
it
where
the
ladies
were
concerned
for
them
he
had
always
gentle
words
and
consideration
he
could
not
have
spoken
a
harsh
word
to
a
woman
he
might
ruthlessly
slay
their
husbands
and
brothers
but
he
could
not
have
laid
the
weight
of
a
finger
in
anger
upon
a
woman
wherefore
many
of
that
interesting
division
of
humanity
who
had
come
under
the
spell
of
his
politeness
declared
their
disbelief
in
the
stories
circulated
about
mr
kid
one
should
believe
everything
one
heard
they
said
when
confronted
by
their
indignant
men
folk
with
proof
of
the
deeds
of
infamy
they
said
maybe
he
had
been
driven
to
it
and
that
he
knew
how
to
treat
a
lady
anyhow
considering
this
extremely
courteous
idiosyncrasy
of
the
kid
and
the
pride
he
took
in
it
one
can
perceive
that
the
solution
of
the
problem
that
was
presented
to
him
by
what
he
saw
and
heard
from
his
place
in
the
pear
that
afternoon
at
least
as
to
one
of
the
actors
must
have
been
obscured
by
difficulties
and
yet
one
could
not
think
of
the
kid
overlooking
little
matters
of
that
kind
at
the
end
of
the
short
twilight
they
gathered
around
a
supper
of
goat
steaks
canned
peaches
and
coffee
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
in
the
afterward
the
ancestor
his
flock
corralled
smoked
a
cigarette
and
became
a
mummy
in
a
grey
blanket
tonia
washed
the
few
dishes
while
the
kid
dried
them
with
the
towel
her
eyes
shone
she
chatted
volubly
of
the
inconsequent
happenings
of
her
small
world
since
the
kid
last
visit
it
was
as
all
his
other
had
been
then
outside
tonia
swung
in
a
grass
hammock
with
her
guitar
and
sang
sad
de
do
you
love
me
just
the
same
old
girl
asked
the
kid
hunting
for
his
cigarette
papers
always
the
same
little
one
said
tonia
her
dark
eyes
lingering
upon
him
i
must
go
over
to
fink
said
the
kid
rising
for
some
tobacco
i
thought
i
had
another
sack
in
my
coat
i
be
back
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
hasten
said
tonia
and
tell
me
how
long
shall
i
call
you
my
own
this
time
will
you
be
gone
again
leaving
me
to
grieve
or
will
you
be
longer
with
your
tonia
oh
i
might
stay
two
or
three
days
this
trip
said
the
kid
yawning
i
been
on
the
dodge
for
a
month
and
i
like
to
rest
up
he
was
gone
half
an
hour
for
his
tobacco
when
he
returned
tonia
was
still
lying
in
the
hammock
it
funny
said
the
kid
how
i
feel
i
feel
like
there
was
somebody
lying
behind
every
bush
and
tree
waiting
to
shoot
me
i
never
had
mullygrubs
like
them
before
maybe
it
one
of
them
presumptions
i
got
half
a
notion
to
light
out
in
the
morning
before
day
the
guadalupe
country
is
burning
up
about
that
old
dutchman
i
plugged
down
there
you
are
not
afraid
no
one
could
make
my
brave
little
one
fear
well
i
have
been
usually
regarded
as
a
when
it
comes
to
scrapping
but
i
do
want
a
posse
smoking
me
out
when
i
in
your
somebody
might
get
hurt
that
ought
to
remain
with
your
tonia
no
one
will
find
you
here
the
kid
looked
keenly
into
the
shadows
up
and
down
the
arroyo
and
toward
the
dim
lights
of
the
mexican
village
i
see
how
it
looks
later
on
was
his
decision
at
midnight
a
horseman
rode
into
the
rangers
camp
blazing
his
way
by
noisy
halloes
to
indicate
a
pacific
mission
sandridge
and
one
or
two
others
turned
out
to
investigate
the
row
the
rider
announced
himself
to
be
domingo
sales
from
the
lone
wolf
crossing
he
bore
a
letter
for
senor
sandridge
old
luisa
the
had
persuaded
him
to
bring
it
he
said
her
son
gregorio
being
too
ill
of
a
fever
to
ride
sandridge
lighted
the
camp
lantern
and
read
the
letter
these
were
its
words
he
has
come
hardly
had
you
ridden
away
when
he
came
out
of
the
pear
when
he
first
talked
he
said
he
would
stay
three
days
or
more
then
as
it
grew
later
he
was
like
a
wolf
or
a
fox
and
walked
about
without
rest
looking
and
listening
soon
he
said
he
must
leave
before
daylight
when
it
is
dark
and
stillest
and
then
he
seemed
to
suspect
that
i
be
not
true
to
him
he
looked
at
me
so
strange
that
i
am
frightened
i
swear
to
him
that
i
love
him
his
own
tonia
last
of
all
he
said
i
must
prove
to
him
i
am
true
he
thinks
that
even
now
men
are
waiting
to
kill
him
as
he
rides
from
my
house
to
escape
he
says
he
will
dress
in
my
clothes
my
red
skirt
and
the
blue
waist
i
wear
and
the
brown
mantilla
over
the
head
and
thus
ride
away
but
before
that
he
says
that
i
must
put
on
his
clothes
his
and
and
hat
and
ride
away
on
his
horse
from
the
as
far
as
the
big
road
beyond
the
crossing
and
back
again
this
before
he
goes
so
he
can
tell
if
i
am
true
and
if
men
are
hidden
to
shoot
him
it
is
a
terrible
thing
an
hour
before
daybreak
this
is
to
be
come
my
dear
one
and
kill
this
man
and
take
me
for
your
tonia
do
not
try
to
take
hold
of
him
alive
but
kill
him
quickly
knowing
all
you
should
do
that
you
must
come
long
before
the
time
and
hide
yourself
in
the
little
shed
near
the
where
the
wagon
and
saddles
are
kept
it
is
dark
in
there
he
will
wear
my
red
skirt
and
blue
waist
and
brown
mantilla
i
send
you
a
hundred
kisses
come
surely
and
shoot
quickly
and
straight
thine
own
tonia
sandridge
quickly
explained
to
his
men
the
official
part
of
the
missive
the
rangers
protested
against
his
going
alone
i
get
him
easy
enough
said
the
lieutenant
the
girl
got
him
trapped
and
do
even
think
he
get
the
drop
on
me
sandridge
saddled
his
horse
and
rode
to
the
lone
wolf
crossing
he
tied
his
big
dun
in
a
clump
of
brush
on
the
arroyo
took
his
winchester
from
its
scabbard
and
carefully
approached
the
perez
there
was
only
the
half
of
a
high
moon
drifted
over
by
ragged
gulf
clouds
the
was
an
excellent
place
for
ambush
and
the
ranger
got
inside
it
safely
in
the
black
shadow
of
the
brush
shelter
in
front
of
the
he
could
see
a
horse
tied
and
hear
him
impatiently
pawing
the
earth
he
waited
almost
an
hour
before
two
figures
came
out
of
the
one
in
man
clothes
quickly
mounted
the
horse
and
galloped
past
the
toward
the
crossing
and
village
and
then
the
other
figure
in
skirt
waist
and
mantilla
over
its
head
stepped
out
into
the
faint
moonlight
gazing
after
the
rider
sandridge
thought
he
would
take
his
chance
then
before
tonia
rode
back
he
fancied
she
might
not
care
to
see
it
throw
up
your
hands
he
ordered
loudly
stepping
out
of
the
shed
with
his
winchester
at
his
shoulder
there
was
a
quick
turn
of
the
figure
but
no
movement
to
obey
so
the
ranger
pumped
in
the
bullets
one
two
three
and
then
twice
more
for
you
never
could
be
too
sure
of
bringing
down
the
cisco
kid
there
was
no
danger
of
missing
at
ten
paces
even
in
that
half
moonlight
the
old
ancestor
asleep
on
his
blanket
was
awakened
by
the
shots
listening
further
he
heard
a
great
cry
from
some
man
in
mortal
distress
or
anguish
and
rose
up
grumbling
at
the
disturbing
ways
of
moderns
the
tall
red
ghost
of
a
man
burst
into
the
reaching
one
hand
shaking
like
a
reed
for
the
lantern
hanging
on
its
nail
the
other
spread
a
letter
on
the
table
look
at
this
letter
perez
cried
the
man
who
wrote
it
it
is
senor
sandridge
mumbled
the
old
man
approaching
that
letter
was
written
by
as
he
is
called
by
the
man
of
tonia
they
say
he
is
a
bad
man
i
do
not
know
while
tonia
slept
he
wrote
the
letter
and
sent
it
by
this
old
hand
of
mine
to
domingo
sales
to
be
brought
to
you
is
there
anything
wrong
in
the
letter
i
am
very
old
and
i
did
not
know
it
is
a
very
foolish
world
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
house
to
drink
nothing
to
drink
just
then
all
that
sandridge
could
think
of
to
do
was
to
go
outside
and
throw
himself
face
downward
in
the
dust
by
the
side
of
his
of
whom
not
a
feather
fluttered
he
was
not
a
by
instinct
and
he
could
not
understand
the
niceties
of
revenge
a
mile
away
the
rider
who
had
ridden
past
the
struck
up
a
harsh
untuneful
song
the
words
of
which
began

bildad
rose
the
stopped
his
team
a
furious
snow
had
been
falling
all
day
eight
inches
it
measured
now
on
a
level
the
remainder
of
the
road
was
not
without
peril
in
daylight
creeping
along
the
ribs
of
a
bijou
range
of
ragged
mountains
now
when
both
snow
and
night
masked
its
dangers
further
travel
was
not
to
be
thought
of
said
bildad
rose
so
he
pulled
up
his
four
stout
horses
and
delivered
to
his
five
passengers
oral
deductions
of
his
wisdom

to
whom
men
granted

and
the
initiatory
as

of

to

the

a
young

in

halted
upon
the
shoulder
of
the

mountain
spur
two
hemmed
the
road
fifty
yards
above
the
upper
fence
showing
a
dark
blot
in
the
white
drifts
stood
a
small
house
upon
this
house
descended
or
rather
ascended
judge
menefee
and
his
cohorts
with
boyish
whoops
born
of
the
snow
and
stress
they
called
they
pounded
at
window
and
door
at
the
inhospitable
silence
they
waxed
restive
they
assaulted
and
forced
the
pregnable
barriers
and
invaded
the
premises
the
watchers
from
the
coach
heard
stumblings
and
shoutings
from
the
interior
of
the
ravaged
house
before
long
a
light
within
flickered
glowed
flamed
high
and
bright
and
cheerful
then
came
running
back
through
the
driving
flakes
the
exuberant
explorers
more
deeply
pitched
than
the
clarion
even
orchestral
in
volume
the
voice
of
judge
menefee
proclaimed
the
succour
that
lay
in
apposition
with
their
state
of
travail
the
one
room
of
the
house
was
uninhabited
he
said
and
bare
of
furniture
but
it
contained
a
great
fireplace
and
they
had
discovered
an
ample
store
of
chopped
wood
in
a
at
the
rear
housing
and
warmth
against
the
shivering
night
were
thus
assured
for
the
placation
of
bildad
rose
there
was
news
of
a
stable
not
ruined
beyond
service
with
hay
in
a
loft
near
the
house
gentlemen
cried
bildad
rose
from
his
seat
swathed
in
coats
and
robes
tear
me
down

panels
of
that
fence
so
i
can
drive
in
that
is

shanty
i
thought
we
must
be
nigh
it
they
took
him
to
the
foolish
house
in
august
cheerfully
the
four
passengers
sprang
at
the
rails
the
exhorted
team
tugged
the
coach
up
the
slant
to
the
door
of
the
edifice
from
which
a
madness
had
ravished
its
proprietor
the
driver
and
two
of
the
passengers
began
to
unhitch
judge
menefee
opened
the
door
of
the
coach
and
removed
his
hat
i
have
to
announce
miss
garland
said
he
the
enforced
suspension
of
our
journey
the
driver
asserts
that
the
risk
in
travelling
the
mountain
road
by
night
is
too
great
even
to
consider
it
will
be
necessary
to
remain
in
the
shelter
of
this
house
until
morning
i
beg
that
you
will
feel
that
there
is
nothing
to
fear
beyond
a
temporary
inconvenience
i
have
personally
inspected
the
house
and
find
that
there
are
means
to
provide
against
the
rigour
of
the
weather
at
least
you
shall
be
made
as
comfortable
as
possible
permit
me
to
assist
you
to
alight
to
the
judge
side
came
the
passenger
whose
pursuit
in
life
was
the
placing
of
the
little
goliath
windmill
his
name
was
dunwoody
but
that
matters
not
much
in
travelling
merely
from
paradise
to
sunrise
city
one
needs
little
or
no
name
still
one
who
would
seek
to
divide
honours
with
judge
madison
menefee
deserves
a
cognomenal
peg
upon
which
fame
may
hang
a
wreath
thus
spake
loudly
and
buoyantly
the
aerial
miller
guess
you
have
to
climb
out
of
the
ark
mcfarland
this
wigwam
is
exactly
the
palmer
house
but
it
turns
snow
and
they
wo
search
your
grip
for
souvenir
spoons
when
you
leave
got
a
fire
going
and
fix
you
up
with
dry
tilbys
and
keep
the
mice
away
anyhow
all
right
all
right
one
of
the
two
passengers
who
were
struggling
in
a
melee
of
horses
harness
snow
and
the
sarcastic
injunctions
of
bildad
rose
called
loudly
from
the
whirl
of
his
volunteer
duties
say
some
of
you
fellows
get
miss
solomon
into
the
house
will
you
whoa
there
you
confounded
brute
again
must
it
be
gently
urged
that
in
travelling
from
paradise
to
sunrise
city
an
accurate
name
is
prodigality
when
judge
menefee
sanctioned
to
the
act
by
his
grey
hair
and
widespread
repute
had
introduced
himself
to
the
lady
passenger
she
had
herself
sweetly
breathed
a
name
in
response
that
the
hearing
of
the
male
passengers
had
variously
interpreted
in
the
not
unjealous
spirit
of
rivalry
that
eventuated
each
clung
stubbornly
to
his
own
theory
for
the
lady
passenger
to
have
reasseverated
or
corrected
would
have
seemed
didactic
if
not
unduly
solicitous
of
a
specific
acquaintance
therefore
the
lady
passenger
permitted
herself
to
be
garlanded
and
mcfarlanded
and
solomoned
with
equal
and
discreet
complacency
it
is
miles
from
paradise
to
sunrise
city
de
is
name
enough
by
the
gripsack
of
the
wandering
jew
for
so
brief
a
journey
soon
the
little
party
of
wayfarers
were
happily
seated
in
a
cheerful
arc
before
the
roaring
fire
the
robes
cushions
and
removable
portions
of
the
coach
had
been
brought
in
and
put
to
service
the
lady
passenger
chose
a
place
near
the
hearth
at
one
end
of
the
arc
there
she
graced
almost
a
throne
that
her
subjects
had
prepared
she
sat
upon
cushions
and
leaned
against
an
empty
box
and
barrel
robe
bespread
which
formed
a
defence
from
the
invading
draughts
she
extended
her
feet
delectably
shod
to
the
cordial
heat
she
ungloved
her
hands
but
retained
about
her
neck
her
long
fur
boa
the
unstable
flames
half
revealed
while
the
warding
boa
half
submerged
her
face
a
youthful
face
altogether
feminine
clearly
moulded
and
calm
with
beauty
unchallenged
confidence
chivalry
and
manhood
were
here
vying
to
please
and
comfort
her
she
seemed
to
accept
their
devoirs
not
piquantly
as
one
courted
and
attended
nor
preeningly
as
many
of
her
sex
unworthily
reap
their
honours
not
yet
stolidly
as
the
ox
receives
his
hay
but
concordantly
with
nature
own
plan
as
the
lily
ingests
the
drop
of
dew
foreordained
to
its
refreshment
outside
the
wind
roared
mightily
the
fine
snow
whizzed
through
the
cracks
the
cold
besieged
the
backs
of
the
immolated
six
but
the
elements
did
not
lack
a
champion
that
night
judge
menefee
was
attorney
for
the
storm
the
weather
was
his
client
and
he
strove
by
special
pleading
to
convince
his
companions
in
that
frigid
that
they
sojourned
in
a
bower
of
roses
beset
only
by
benignant
zephyrs
he
drew
upon
a
fund
of
gaiety
wit
and
anecdote
sophistical
but
crowned
with
success
his
cheerfulness
communicated
itself
irresistibly
each
one
hastened
to
contribute
his
own
quota
toward
the
general
optimism
even
the
lady
passenger
was
moved
to
expression
i
think
it
is
quite
charming
she
said
in
her
slow
crystal
tones
at
intervals
some
one
of
the
passengers
would
rise
and
humorously
explore
the
room
there
was
little
evidence
to
be
collected
of
its
habitation
by
old
man
redruth
bildad
rose
was
called
upon
vivaciously
for
the
history
now
since
the
horses
were
fairly
comfortable
and
his
passengers
appeared
to
be
so
peace
and
comity
returned
to
him
the
old
didapper
began
bildad
somewhat
irreverently
infested
this
here
house
about
twenty
year
he
never
allowed
nobody
to
come
nigh
him
he
duck
his
head
inside
and
slam
the
door
whenever
a
team
drove
along
there
was
up
in
his
loft
all
right
he
used
to
buy
his
groceries
and
tobacco
at
sam
tilly
store
on
the
little
muddy
last
august
he
went
up
there
dressed
in
a
red
bedquilt
and
told
sam
he
was
king
solomon
and
that
the
queen
of
sheba
was
coming
to
visit
him
he
fetched
along
all
the
money
he
had
a
little
bag
full
of
silver
and
dropped
it
in
sam
well
wo
come
says
old
man
redruth
to
sam
she
knows
i
got
any
money
as
soon
as
folks
heard
he
had
that
sort
of
a
theory
about
women
and
money
they
knowed
he
was
crazy
so
they
sent
down
and
packed
him
to
the
foolish
asylum
was
there
a
romance
in
his
life
that
drove
him
to
a
solitary
existence
asked
one
of
the
passengers
a
young
man
who
had
an
agency
no
said
bildad
not
that
i
ever
heard
spoke
of
just
ordinary
trouble
they
say
he
had
had
unfortunateness
in
the
way
of
love
derangements
with
a
young
lady
when
he
was
young
before
he
contracted
red
and
had
his
financial
conclusions
disqualified
i
never
heard
of
no
romance
ah
exclaimed
judge
menefee
impressively
a
case
of
unrequited
affection
no
doubt
no
sir
returned
bildad
not
at
all
she
never
married
him
marmaduke
mulligan
down
at
paradise
seen
a
man
once
that
come
from
old
redruth
town
he
said
redruth
was
a
fine
young
man
but
when
you
kicked
him
on
the
pocket
all
you
could
hear
jingle
was
a
and
a
bunch
of
keys
he
was
engaged
to
this
young
lady
miss
alice
something
was
her
name
i
forgot
this
man
said
she
was
the
kind
of
girl
you
like
to
have
reach
across
you
in
a
car
to
pay
the
fare
well
there
come
to
the
town
a
young
chap
all
affluent
and
easy
and
fixed
up
with
buggies
and
mining
stock
and
leisure
time
although
she
was
a
staked
claim
miss
alice
and
the
new
entry
seemed
to
strike
a
mutual
kind
of
a
clip
they
had
calls
and
coincidences
of
going
to
the
post
office
and
such
things
as
sometimes
make
a
girl
send
back
the
engagement
ring
and
other
presents
rift
within
the
loot
the
poetry
man
calls
it
one
day
folks
seen
redruth
and
miss
alice
standing
talking
at
the
gate
then
he
lifts
his
hat
and
walks
away
and
that
was
the
last
anybody
in
that
town
seen
of
him
as
far
as
this
man
knew
what
about
the
young
lady
asked
the
young
man
who
had
an
agency
never
heard
answered
bildad
right
there
is
where
my
lode
of
information
turns
to
an
old
spavined
crowbait
and
folds
its
wings
for
i
pumped
it
dry
a
very
sad
began
judge
menefee
but
his
remark
was
curtailed
by
a
higher
authority
what
a
charming
story
said
the
lady
passenger
in
tones
a
little
silence
followed
except
for
the
wind
and
the
crackling
of
the
fire
the
men
were
seated
upon
the
floor
having
slightly
mitigated
its
inhospitable
surface
with
wraps
and
stray
pieces
of
boards
the
man
who
was
placing
little
goliath
windmills
arose
and
walked
about
to
ease
his
cramped
muscles
suddenly
a
triumphant
shout
came
from
him
he
hurried
back
from
a
dusky
corner
of
the
room
bearing
aloft
something
in
his
hand
it
was
an
apple
a
large
firm
pippin
pleasing
to
behold
in
a
paper
bag
on
a
high
shelf
in
that
corner
he
had
found
it
it
could
have
been
no
relic
of
the
lovewrecked
redruth
for
its
glorious
soundness
repudiated
the
theory
that
it
had
lain
on
that
musty
shelf
since
august
no
doubt
some
recent
bivouackers
lunching
in
the
deserted
house
had
left
it
there
dunwoody
again
his
exploits
demand
for
him
the
honours
of
nomenclature
flaunted
his
apple
in
the
faces
of
his
see
what
i
found
mrs
mcfarland
he
cried
vaingloriously
he
held
the
apple
high
up
in
the
light
of
the
fire
where
it
glowed
a
still
richer
red
the
lady
passenger
smiled
calmly
always
calmly
what
a
charming
apple
she
murmured
clearly
for
a
brief
space
judge
menefee
felt
crushed
humiliated
relegated
second
place
galled
him
why
had
this
blatant
obtrusive
unpolished
man
of
windmills
been
selected
by
fate
instead
of
himself
to
discover
the
sensational
apple
he
could
have
made
of
the
act
a
scene
a
function
a
setting
for
some
impromptu
fanciful
discourse
or
piece
of
comedy
and
have
retained
the
role
of
cynosure
actually
the
lady
passenger
was
regarding
this
ridiculous
dunboddy
or
woodbundy
with
an
admiring
smile
as
if
the
fellow
had
performed
a
feat
and
the
windmill
man
swelled
and
gyrated
like
a
sample
of
his
own
goods
puffed
up
with
the
wind
that
ever
blows
from
the
chorus
land
toward
the
domain
of
the
star
while
the
transported
dunwoody
with
his
aladdin
apple
was
receiving
the
fickle
attentions
of
all
the
resourceful
jurist
formed
a
plan
to
recover
his
own
laurels
with
his
courtliest
smile
upon
his
heavy
but
classic
features
judge
menefee
advanced
and
took
the
apple
as
if
to
examine
it
from
the
hand
of
dunwoody
in
his
hand
it
became
exhibit
a
a
fine
apple
he
said
approvingly
really
my
dear
dudwindy
you
have
eclipsed
all
of
us
as
a
forager
but
i
have
an
idea
this
apple
shall
become
an
emblem
a
token
a
symbol
a
prize
bestowed
by
the
mind
and
heart
of
beauty
upon
the
most
deserving
the
audience
except
one
applauded
good
on
the
stump
ai
he
commented
the
passenger
who
was
nobody
in
particular
to
the
young
man
who
had
an
agency
the
unresponsive
one
was
the
windmill
man
he
saw
himself
reduced
to
the
ranks
never
would
the
thought
have
occurred
to
him
to
declare
his
apple
an
emblem
he
had
intended
after
it
had
been
divided
and
eaten
to
create
diversion
by
sticking
the
seeds
against
his
forehead
and
naming
them
for
young
ladies
of
his
acquaintance
one
he
was
going
to
name
mcfarland
the
seed
that
fell
off
first
would
be
but
was
too
late
now
the
apple
continued
judge
menefee
charging
his
jury
in
modern
days
occupies
though
undeservedly
a
lowly
place
in
our
esteem
indeed
it
is
so
constantly
associated
with
the
culinary
and
the
commercial
that
it
is
hardly
to
be
classed
among
the
polite
fruits
but
in
ancient
times
this
was
not
so
biblical
historical
and
mythological
lore
abounds
with
evidences
that
the
apple
was
the
aristocrat
of
fruits
we
still
say
apple
of
the
eye
when
we
wish
to
describe
something
superlatively
precious
we
find
in
proverbs
the
comparison
to
of
silver
no
other
product
of
tree
or
vine
has
been
so
utilised
in
figurative
speech
who
has
not
heard
of
and
longed
for
the
of
the
hesperides
i
need
not
call
your
attention
to
the
most
tremendous
and
significant
instance
of
the
apple
ancient
prestige
when
its
consumption
by
our
first
parents
occasioned
the
fall
of
man
from
his
state
of
goodness
and
perfection
apples
like
them
said
the
windmill
man
lingering
with
the
objective
article
are
worth
a
barrel
in
the
chicago
market
now
what
i
have
to
propose
said
judge
menefee
conceding
an
indulgent
smile
to
his
interrupter
is
this
we
must
remain
here
perforce
until
morning
we
have
wood
in
plenty
to
keep
us
warm
our
next
need
is
to
entertain
ourselves
as
best
we
can
in
order
that
the
time
shall
not
pass
too
slowly
i
propose
that
we
place
this
apple
in
the
hands
of
miss
garland
it
is
no
longer
a
fruit
but
as
i
said
a
prize
in
award
representing
a
great
human
idea
miss
garland
herself
shall
cease
to
be
an
individual
but
only
temporarily
i
am
happy
to
add
a
low
bow
full
of
the
grace
she
shall
represent
her
sex
she
shall
be
the
embodiment
the
epitome
of
womankind
the
heart
and
brain
i
may
say
of
god
masterpiece
of
creation
in
this
guise
she
shall
judge
and
decide
the
question
which
follows
but
a
few
minutes
ago
our
friend
rose
favoured
us
with
an
entertaining
but
fragmentary
sketch
of
the
romance
in
the
life
of
the
former
professor
of
this
habitation
the
few
facts
that
we
have
learned
seem
to
me
to
open
up
a
fascinating
field
for
conjecture
for
the
study
of
human
hearts
for
the
exercise
of
the
imagination
in
short
for
let
us
make
use
of
the
opportunity
let
each
one
of
us
relate
his
own
version
of
the
story
of
redruth
the
hermit
and
his
beginning
where
rose
narrative
ends
at
the
parting
of
the
lovers
at
the
gate
this
much
should
be
assumed
and
conceded
that
the
young
lady
was
not
necessarily
to
blame
for
redruth
becoming
a
crazed
and
hermit
when
we
have
done
miss
garland
shall
render
the
judgement
of
woman
as
the
spirit
of
her
sex
she
shall
decide
which
version
of
the
story
best
and
most
truly
depicts
human
and
love
interest
and
most
faithfully
estimates
the
character
and
acts
of
redruth
betrothed
according
to
the
feminine
view
the
apple
shall
be
bestowed
upon
him
who
is
awarded
the
decision
if
you
are
all
agreed
we
shall
be
pleased
to
hear
the
first
story
from
mr
dinwiddie
the
last
sentence
captured
the
windmill
man
he
was
not
one
to
linger
in
the
dumps
that
a
scheme
judge
he
said
heartily
be
a
regular
vaudeville
wo
it
i
used
to
be
correspondent
for
a
paper
in
springfield
and
when
there
was
any
news
i
faked
it
guess
i
can
do
my
turn
all
right
i
think
the
idea
is
charming
said
the
lady
passenger
brightly
it
will
be
almost
like
a
game
judge
menefee
stepped
forward
and
placed
the
apple
in
her
hand
impressively
in
olden
days
he
said
orotundly
paris
awarded
the
golden
apple
to
the
most
beautiful
i
was
at
the
exposition
remarked
the
windmill
man
now
cheerful
again
but
i
never
heard
of
it
and
i
was
on
the
midway
too
all
the
time
i
was
at
the
machinery
exhibit
but
now
continued
the
judge
the
fruit
shall
translate
to
us
the
mystery
and
wisdom
of
the
feminine
heart
take
the
apple
miss
garland
hear
our
modest
tales
of
romance
and
then
award
the
prize
as
you
may
deem
it
just
the
lady
passenger
smiled
sweetly
the
apple
lay
in
her
lap
beneath
her
robes
and
wraps
she
reclined
against
her
protecting
bulwark
brightly
and
cosily
at
ease
but
for
the
voices
and
the
wind
one
might
have
listened
hopefully
to
hear
her
purr
someone
cast
fresh
logs
upon
the
fire
judge
menefee
nodded
suavely
will
you
oblige
us
with
the
initial
story
he
asked
the
windmill
man
sat
as
sits
a
turk
with
his
hat
well
back
on
his
head
on
account
of
the
draughts
well
he
began
without
any
embarrassment
this
is
about
the
way
i
size
up
the
difficulty
of
course
redruth
was
jostled
a
good
deal
by
this
duck
who
had
money
to
play
ball
with
who
tried
to
cut
him
out
of
his
girl
so
he
goes
around
naturally
and
asks
her
if
the
game
is
still
square
well
nobody
wants
a
guy
cutting
in
with
buggies
and
gold
bonds
when
he
got
an
option
on
a
girl
well
he
goes
around
to
see
her
well
maybe
he
hot
and
talks
like
the
proprietor
and
forgets
that
an
engagement
ai
always
a
cinch
well
i
guess
that
makes
alice
warm
under
the
lacy
yoke
well
she
answers
back
sharp
well
he
say
interrupted
the
passenger
who
was
nobody
in
particular
if
you
could
put
up
a
windmill
on
every
one
of
them
you
using
you
be
able
to
retire
from
business
would
you
the
windmill
man
grinned
oh
i
ai
no
de
he
said
cheerfully
i
giving
it
to
you
in
straight
american
well
she
says
something
like
this
gold
bonds
is
only
a
friend
says
she
he
takes
me
riding
and
buys
me
theatre
tickets
and
that
what
you
never
do
ai
i
to
never
have
any
pleasure
in
life
while
i
can
this
chatfield
thing
along
says
redruth
out
the
mitt
to
the
willie
with
creases
in
it
or
you
do
put
your
slippers
under
my
wardrobe
now
that
kind
of
train
orders
do
go
with
a
girl
that
got
any
spirit
i
bet
that
girl
loved
her
honey
all
the
time
maybe
she
only
wanted
as
girls
do
to
work
the
good
thing
for
a
little
fun
and
caramels
before
she
settled
down
to
patch
george
other
pair
and
be
a
good
wife
but
he
is
glued
to
the
high
horse
and
wo
come
down
well
she
hands
him
back
the
ring
proper
enough
and
george
goes
away
and
hits
the
booze
yep
that
what
done
it
i
bet
that
girl
fired
the
cornucopia
with
the
fancy
vest
two
days
after
her
steady
left
george
boards
a
freight
and
checks
his
bag
of
crackers
for
parts
unknown
he
sticks
to
old
booze
for
a
number
of
years
and
then
the
aniline
and
aquafortis
gets
the
decision
for
the
hermit
hut
says
george
the
long
whiskers
and
the
buried
can
of
money
that
is
there
but
that
alice
in
my
mind
was
on
the
level
she
never
married
but
took
up
typewriting
as
soon
as
the
wrinkles
began
to
show
and
kept
a
cat
that
came
when
you
said
weeny
weeny
i
got
too
much
faith
in
good
women
to
believe
they
throw
down
the
fellow
stuck
on
every
time
for
the
dough
the
windmill
man
ceased
i
think
said
the
lady
passenger
slightly
moving
upon
her
lowly
throne
that
that
is
a
char
oh
miss
garland
interposed
judge
menefee
with
uplifted
hand
i
beg
of
you
no
comments
it
would
not
be
fair
to
the
other
contestants
er
will
you
take
the
next
turn
the
judge
addressed
the
young
man
who
had
the
agency
my
version
of
the
romance
began
the
young
man
diffidently
clasping
his
hands
would
be
this
they
did
not
quarrel
when
they
parted
redruth
bade
her
and
went
out
into
the
world
to
seek
his
fortune
he
knew
his
love
would
remain
true
to
him
he
scorned
the
thought
that
his
rival
could
make
an
impression
upon
a
heart
so
fond
and
faithful
i
would
say
that
redruth
went
out
to
the
rocky
mountains
in
wyoming
to
seek
for
gold
one
day
a
crew
of
pirates
landed
and
captured
him
while
at
work
and
hey
what
that
sharply
called
the
passenger
who
was
nobody
in
particular
a
crew
of
pirates
landed
in
the
rocky
mountains
will
you
tell
us
how
they
sailed
landed
from
a
train
said
the
narrator
quietly
and
not
without
some
readiness
they
kept
him
prisoner
in
a
cave
for
months
and
then
they
took
him
hundreds
of
miles
away
to
the
forests
of
alaska
there
a
beautiful
indian
girl
fell
in
love
with
him
but
he
remained
true
to
alice
after
another
year
of
wandering
in
the
woods
he
set
out
with
the
diamonds
what
diamonds
asked
the
unimportant
passenger
almost
with
acerbity
the
ones
the
saddlemaker
showed
him
in
the
peruvian
temple
said
the
other
somewhat
obscurely
when
he
reached
home
alice
mother
led
him
weeping
to
a
green
mound
under
a
willow
tree
heart
was
broken
when
you
left
said
her
mother
what
of
my
rival
of
chester
mcintosh
asked
redruth
as
he
knelt
sadly
by
grave
he
found
out
she
answered
her
heart
was
yours
he
pined
away
day
by
day
until
at
length
he
started
a
furniture
store
in
grand
rapids
we
heard
lately
that
he
was
bitten
to
death
by
an
infuriated
moose
near
south
bend
where
he
had
gone
to
try
to
forget
scenes
of
civilisation
with
which
redruth
forsook
the
face
of
mankind
and
became
a
hermit
as
we
have
seen
my
story
concluded
the
young
man
with
an
agency
may
lack
the
literary
quality
but
what
i
wanted
it
to
show
is
that
the
young
lady
remained
true
she
cared
nothing
for
wealth
in
comparison
with
true
affection
i
admire
and
believe
in
the
fair
sex
too
much
to
think
otherwise
the
narrator
ceased
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
the
corner
where
reclined
the
lady
passenger
bildad
rose
was
next
invited
by
judge
menefee
to
contribute
his
story
in
the
contest
for
the
apple
of
judgment
the
essay
was
brief
i
not
one
of
them
lobo
wolves
he
said
who
are
always
blaming
on
women
the
calamities
of
life
my
testimony
in
regards
to
the
fiction
story
you
ask
for
judge
will
be
about
as
follows
what
ailed
redruth
was
pure
laziness
if
he
had
up
and
slugged
this
percival
de
lacey
that
tried
to
give
him
the
outside
of
the
road
and
had
kept
alice
in
the
swing
with
the
on
all
would
have
been
well
the
woman
you
want
is
sure
worth
taking
pains
for
for
me
if
you
want
me
again
says
redruth
and
hoists
his
stetson
and
walks
off
he
have
called
it
pride
but
the
nixycomlogical
name
for
it
is
laziness
no
woman
do
like
to
run
after
a
man
him
come
back
hisself
says
the
girl
and
i
be
bound
she
tells
the
boy
with
the
pay
ore
to
trot
and
then
spends
her
time
watching
out
the
window
for
the
man
with
the
empty
and
the
tickly
moustache
i
reckon
redruth
waits
about
nine
year
expecting
her
to
send
him
a
note
by
a
nigger
asking
him
to
forgive
her
but
she
do
game
wo
work
says
redruth
so
wo
i
and
he
goes
in
the
hermit
business
and
raises
whiskers
yes
laziness
and
whiskers
was
what
done
the
trick
they
travel
together
you
ever
hear
of
a
man
with
long
whiskers
and
hair
striking
a
bonanza
no
look
at
the
duke
of
marlborough
and
this
standard
oil
snoozer
have
they
got
now
this
alice
did
never
marry
i
bet
a
hoss
if
redruth
had
married
somebody
else
she
might
have
done
so
too
but
he
never
turns
up
she
has
these
here
things
they
call
fond
memories
and
maybe
a
lock
of
hair
and
a
corset
steel
that
he
broke
treasured
up
them
sort
of
articles
is
as
good
as
a
husband
to
some
women
i
say
she
played
out
a
lone
hand
i
do
blame
no
woman
for
old
man
abandonment
of
barber
shops
and
clean
shirts
next
in
order
came
the
passenger
who
was
nobody
in
particular
nameless
to
us
he
travels
the
road
from
paradise
to
sunrise
city
but
him
you
shall
see
if
the
firelight
be
not
too
dim
as
he
responds
to
the
judge
call
a
lean
form
in
clothing
sitting
like
a
frog
his
arms
wrapped
about
his
legs
his
chin
resting
upon
his
knees
smooth
hair
long
nose
mouth
like
a
satyr
with
upturned
corners
an
eye
like
a
fish
a
red
necktie
with
a
horseshoe
pin
he
began
with
a
rasping
chuckle
that
gradually
formed
itself
into
words
everybody
wrong
so
far
what
a
romance
without
any
orange
blossoms
ho
ho
my
money
on
the
lad
with
the
butterfly
tie
and
the
certified
checks
in
his
trouserings
take
as
they
parted
at
the
gate
all
right
never
loved
me
says
redruth
wildly
you
would
speak
to
a
man
who
can
buy
you
the
hate
him
says
she
loathe
his
buggy
i
despise
the
elegant
cream
bonbons
he
sends
me
in
gilt
boxes
covered
with
real
lace
i
feel
that
i
could
stab
him
to
the
heart
when
he
presents
me
with
a
solid
medallion
locket
with
turquoises
and
pearls
running
in
a
vine
around
the
border
away
with
him
is
only
you
i
love
to
the
cosey
corner
says
redruth
i
bound
and
lettered
in
east
aurora
get
platonic
if
you
please
no
for
mine
go
and
hate
your
friend
some
more
for
me
the
nickerson
girl
on
avenue
b
and
gum
and
a
trolley
ride
around
that
night
comes
john
croesus
tears
says
he
arranging
his
pearl
pin
have
driven
my
lover
away
says
little
alice
sobbing
hate
the
sight
of
you
me
then
says
john
lighting
a
henry
clay
she
cries
indignantly
you
never
she
says
this
blows
over
and
i
can
do
some
shopping
and
you
see
about
the
licence
there
a
telephone
next
door
if
you
want
to
call
up
the
county
clerk
the
narrator
paused
to
give
vent
to
his
cynical
chuckle
did
they
marry
he
continued
did
the
duck
swallow
the
and
then
i
take
up
the
case
of
old
boy
redruth
there
where
you
are
all
wrong
again
according
to
my
theory
what
turned
him
into
a
hermit
one
says
laziness
one
says
remorse
one
says
booze
i
say
women
did
it
how
old
is
the
old
man
now
asked
the
speaker
turning
to
bildad
rose
i
should
say
about
all
right
he
conducted
his
hermit
shop
here
for
twenty
years
say
he
was
when
he
took
off
his
hat
at
the
gate
that
leaves
twenty
years
for
him
to
account
for
or
else
be
docked
where
did
he
spend
that
ten
and
two
fives
i
give
you
my
idea
up
for
bigamy
say
there
was
the
fat
blonde
in
saint
jo
and
the
panatela
brunette
at
skillet
ridge
and
the
gold
tooth
down
in
the
kaw
valley
redruth
gets
his
cases
mixed
and
they
send
him
up
the
road
he
gets
out
after
they
are
through
with
him
and
says
line
for
me
except
the
crinoline
the
hermit
trade
is
not
overdone
and
the
stenographers
never
apply
to
for
work
the
jolly
hermit
life
for
me
no
more
long
hairs
in
the
comb
or
dill
pickles
lying
around
in
the
cigar
tray
you
tell
me
they
pinched
old
redruth
for
the
noodle
villa
just
because
he
said
he
was
king
solomon
figs
he
solomon
that
all
of
mine
i
guess
it
do
call
for
any
apples
enclosed
find
stamps
it
do
sound
much
like
a
prize
winner
respecting
the
stricture
laid
by
judge
menefee
against
comments
upon
the
stories
all
were
silent
when
the
passenger
who
was
nobody
in
particular
had
concluded
and
then
the
ingenious
originator
of
the
contest
cleared
his
throat
to
begin
the
ultimate
entry
for
the
prize
though
seated
with
small
comfort
upon
the
floor
you
might
search
in
vain
for
any
abatement
of
dignity
in
judge
menefee
the
now
diminishing
firelight
played
softly
upon
his
face
as
clearly
chiselled
as
a
roman
emperor
on
some
old
coin
and
upon
the
thick
waves
of
his
honourable
grey
hair
a
woman
heart
he
began
in
even
but
thrilling
tones
who
can
hope
to
fathom
it
the
ways
and
desires
of
men
are
various
i
think
that
the
hearts
of
all
women
beat
with
the
same
rhythm
and
to
the
same
old
tune
of
love
love
to
a
woman
means
sacrifice
if
she
be
worthy
of
the
name
no
gold
or
rank
will
outweigh
with
her
a
genuine
devotion
gentlemen
of
the
er
i
should
say
my
friends
the
case
of
redruth
love
and
affection
has
been
called
yet
who
is
on
trial
not
redruth
for
he
has
been
punished
not
those
immortal
passions
that
clothe
our
lives
with
the
joy
of
the
angels
then
who
each
man
of
us
here
stands
at
the
bar
to
answer
if
chivalry
or
darkness
inhabits
his
bosom
to
judge
us
sits
womankind
in
the
form
of
one
of
its
fairest
flowers
in
her
hand
she
holds
the
prize
intrinsically
insignificant
but
worthy
of
our
noblest
efforts
to
win
as
a
guerdon
of
approval
from
so
worthy
a
representative
of
feminine
judgment
and
taste
in
taking
up
the
imaginary
history
of
redruth
and
the
fair
being
to
whom
he
gave
his
heart
i
must
in
the
beginning
raise
my
voice
against
the
unworthy
insinuation
that
the
selfishness
or
perfidy
or
love
of
luxury
of
any
woman
drove
him
to
renounce
the
world
i
have
not
found
woman
to
be
so
unspiritual
or
venal
we
must
seek
elsewhere
among
man
baser
nature
and
lower
motives
for
the
cause
there
was
in
all
probability
a
lover
quarrel
as
they
stood
at
the
gate
on
that
memorable
day
tormented
by
jealousy
young
redruth
vanished
from
his
native
haunts
but
had
he
just
cause
to
do
so
there
is
no
evidence
for
or
against
but
there
is
something
higher
than
evidence
there
is
the
grand
eternal
belief
in
woman
goodness
in
her
steadfastness
against
temptation
in
her
loyalty
even
in
the
face
of
proffered
riches
i
picture
to
myself
the
rash
lover
wandering
about
the
world
i
picture
his
gradual
descent
and
finally
his
complete
despair
when
he
realises
that
he
has
lost
the
most
precious
gift
life
had
to
offer
him
then
his
withdrawal
from
the
world
of
sorrow
and
the
subsequent
derangement
of
his
faculties
becomes
intelligible
but
what
do
i
see
on
the
other
hand
a
lonely
woman
fading
away
as
the
years
roll
by
still
faithful
still
waiting
still
watching
for
a
form
and
listening
for
a
step
that
will
come
no
more
she
is
old
now
her
hair
is
white
and
smoothly
banded
each
day
she
sits
at
the
door
and
gazes
longingly
down
the
dusty
road
in
spirit
she
is
waiting
there
at
the
gate
just
as
he
left
her
his
forever
but
not
here
below
yes
my
belief
in
woman
paints
that
picture
in
my
mind
parted
forever
on
earth
but
waiting
she
in
anticipation
of
a
meeting
in
elysium
he
in
the
slough
of
despond
i
thought
he
was
in
the
bughouse
said
the
passenger
who
was
nobody
in
particular
judge
menefee
stirred
a
little
impatiently
the
men
sat
drooping
in
grotesque
attitudes
the
wind
had
abated
its
violence
coming
now
in
fitful
virulent
puffs
the
fire
had
burned
to
a
mass
of
red
coals
which
shed
but
a
dim
light
within
the
room
the
lady
passenger
in
her
cosey
nook
looked
to
be
but
a
formless
dark
bulk
crowned
by
a
mass
of
coiled
sleek
hair
and
showing
but
a
small
space
of
snowy
forehead
above
her
clinging
boa
judge
menefee
got
stiffly
to
his
feet
and
now
miss
garland
he
announced
we
have
concluded
it
is
for
you
to
award
the
prize
to
the
one
of
us
whose
argument
especially
i
may
say
in
regard
to
his
estimate
of
true
womanhood
approaches
nearest
to
your
own
conception
no
answer
came
from
the
lady
passenger
judge
menefee
bent
over
solicitously
the
passenger
who
was
nobody
in
particular
laughed
low
and
harshly
the
lady
was
sleeping
sweetly
the
judge
essayed
to
take
her
hand
to
awaken
her
in
doing
so
he
touched
a
small
cold
round
irregular
something
in
her
lap
she
has
eaten
the
apple
announced
judge
menefee
in
awed
tones
as
he
held
up
the
core
for
them
to
see
xiii
the
missing
chord
i
stopped
overnight
at
the
of
rush
kinney
on
the
sandy
fork
of
the
nueces
kinney
and
i
had
been
strangers
up
to
the
time
when
i
called
hallo
at
his
but
from
that
moment
until
my
departure
on
the
next
morning
we
were
according
to
the
texas
code
undeniable
friends
after
supper
the
ranchman
and
i
lugged
our
chairs
outside
the
house
to
its
floorless
gallery
roofed
with
chaparral
and
sacuista
grass
with
the
rear
legs
of
our
chairs
sinking
deep
into
the
hardpacked
loam
each
of
us
reposed
against
an
elm
pillar
of
the
structure
and
smoked
el
toro
tobacco
while
we
wrangled
amicably
concerning
the
affairs
of
the
rest
of
the
world
as
for
conveying
adequate
conception
of
the
engaging
charm
of
that
prairie
evening
despair
waits
upon
it
it
is
a
bold
chronicler
who
will
undertake
the
description
of
a
texas
night
in
the
early
spring
an
inventory
must
suffice
the
ranch
rested
upon
the
summit
of
a
lenient
slope
the
ambient
prairie
diversified
by
arroyos
and
murky
patches
of
brush
and
pear
lay
around
us
like
a
darkened
bowl
at
the
bottom
of
which
we
reposed
as
dregs
like
a
turquoise
cover
the
sky
pinned
us
there
the
miraculous
air
heady
with
ozone
and
made
memorably
sweet
by
leagues
of
wild
flowerets
gave
tang
and
savour
to
the
breath
in
the
sky
was
a
great
round
mellow
searchlight
which
we
knew
to
be
no
moon
but
the
dark
lantern
of
summer
who
came
to
hunt
northward
the
cowering
spring
in
the
nearest
corral
a
flock
of
sheep
lay
silent
until
a
groundless
panic
would
send
a
squad
of
them
huddling
together
with
a
drumming
rush
for
other
sounds
a
shrill
family
of
coyotes
yapped
beyond
the
and
whippoorwills
twittered
in
the
long
grass
but
even
these
dissonances
hardly
rippled
the
clear
torrent
of
the
notes
that
fell
from
a
dozen
neighbouring
shrubs
and
trees
it
would
not
have
been
preposterous
for
one
to
tiptoe
and
essay
to
touch
the
stars
they
hung
so
bright
and
imminent
kinney
wife
a
young
and
capable
woman
we
had
left
in
the
house
she
remained
to
busy
herself
with
the
domestic
round
of
duties
in
which
i
had
observed
that
she
seemed
to
take
a
buoyant
and
contented
pride
in
one
room
we
had
supped
presently
from
the
other
as
kinney
and
i
sat
without
there
burst
a
volume
of
sudden
and
brilliant
music
if
i
could
justly
estimate
the
art
of
the
construer
of
that
rollicking
fantasia
had
creditably
mastered
the
secrets
of
the
keyboard
a
piano
and
one
so
well
played
seemed
to
me
to
be
an
unusual
thing
to
find
in
that
small
and
unpromising
house
i
must
have
looked
my
surprise
at
rush
kinney
for
he
laughed
in
his
soft
southern
way
and
nodded
at
me
through
the
moonlit
haze
of
our
cigarettes
you
do
often
hear
as
agreeable
a
noise
as
that
on
a
he
remarked
but
i
never
see
any
reason
for
not
playing
up
to
the
arts
and
graces
just
because
we
happen
to
live
out
in
the
brush
a
lonesome
life
for
a
woman
and
if
a
little
music
can
make
it
any
better
why
not
have
it
that
the
way
i
look
at
it
a
wise
and
generous
theory
i
assented
and
kinney
plays
well
i
am
not
learned
in
the
science
of
music
but
i
should
call
her
an
uncommonly
good
performer
she
has
technic
and
more
than
ordinary
power
the
moon
was
very
bright
you
will
understand
and
i
saw
upon
face
a
sort
of
amused
and
pregnant
expression
as
though
there
were
things
behind
it
that
might
be
expounded
you
came
up
the
trail
from
the
fork
he
said
promisingly
as
you
crossed
it
you
must
have
seen
an
old
deserted
to
your
left
under
a
comma
mott
i
did
said
i
there
was
a
drove
of
rooting
around
it
i
could
see
by
the
broken
corrals
that
no
one
lived
there
that
where
this
music
proposition
started
said
kinney
i
mind
telling
you
about
it
while
we
smoke
that
where
old
cal
adams
lived
he
had
about
eight
hundred
graded
merinos
and
a
daughter
that
was
solid
silk
and
as
handsome
as
a
new
on
a
pony
and
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
i
was
guilty
in
the
second
degree
of
hanging
around
old
cal
ranch
all
the
time
i
could
spare
away
from
lambing
and
shearing
miss
marilla
was
her
name
and
i
had
figured
it
out
by
the
rule
of
two
that
she
was
destined
to
become
the
chatelaine
and
lady
superior
of
rancho
lomito
belonging
to
kinney
where
you
are
now
a
welcome
and
honoured
guest
i
will
say
that
old
cal
was
distinguished
as
a
sheepman
he
was
a
little
old
about
as
big
as
a
gun
scabbard
with
scraggy
white
whiskers
and
condemned
to
the
continuous
use
of
language
old
cal
was
so
obscure
in
his
chosen
profession
that
he
was
even
hated
by
the
cowmen
and
when
a
sheepman
do
get
eminent
enough
to
acquire
the
hostility
of
the
cattlemen
he
is
mighty
apt
to
die
unwept
and
considerably
unsung
but
that
marilla
girl
was
a
benefit
to
the
eye
and
she
was
the
most
elegant
kind
of
a
housekeeper
i
was
the
nearest
neighbour
and
i
used
to
ride
over
to
the
anywhere
from
nine
to
sixteen
times
a
week
with
fresh
butter
or
a
quarter
of
venison
or
a
sample
of
new
just
as
a
frivolous
excuse
to
see
marilla
marilla
and
me
got
to
be
extensively
inveigled
with
each
other
and
i
was
pretty
sure
i
was
going
to
get
my
rope
around
her
neck
and
lead
her
over
to
the
lomito
only
she
was
so
everlastingly
permeated
with
filial
sentiments
toward
old
cal
that
i
never
could
get
her
to
talk
about
serious
matters
you
never
saw
anybody
in
your
life
that
was
as
full
of
knowledge
and
had
less
sense
than
old
cal
he
was
advised
about
all
the
branches
of
information
contained
in
learning
and
he
was
up
to
all
the
rudiments
of
doctrines
and
enlightenment
you
could
advance
him
any
ideas
on
any
of
the
parts
of
speech
or
lines
of
thought
you
would
have
thought
he
was
a
professor
of
the
weather
and
politics
and
chemistry
and
natural
history
and
the
origin
of
derivations
any
subject
you
brought
up
old
cal
could
give
you
an
abundant
synopsis
of
it
from
the
greek
root
up
to
the
time
it
was
sacked
and
on
the
market
one
day
just
after
the
fall
shearing
i
rides
over
to
the
with
a
lady
magazine
about
fashions
for
marilla
and
a
scientific
paper
for
old
cal
while
i
was
tying
my
pony
to
a
mesquite
out
runs
marilla
to
death
with
some
news
that
could
wait
rush
she
says
all
flushed
up
with
esteem
and
gratification
do
you
think
dad
going
to
buy
me
a
piano
ai
it
grand
i
never
dreamed
i
ever
have
one
sure
joyful
says
i
always
admired
the
agreeable
uproar
of
a
piano
it
be
lots
of
company
for
you
that
mighty
good
of
uncle
cal
to
do
that
all
undecided
says
marilla
a
piano
and
an
organ
a
parlour
organ
is
nice
of
says
i
for
mitigating
the
lack
of
noise
around
a
for
my
part
i
says
should
like
anything
better
than
to
ride
home
of
an
evening
and
listen
to
a
few
waltzes
and
jigs
with
somebody
about
your
size
sitting
on
the
stool
and
rounding
up
the
notes
hush
about
that
says
marilla
go
on
in
the
house
dad
has
rode
out
he
not
feeling
well
old
cal
was
inside
lying
on
a
cot
he
had
a
pretty
bad
cold
and
cough
i
stayed
to
supper
to
get
marilla
a
piano
i
hear
says
i
to
him
yes
something
of
the
kind
rush
says
he
been
hankering
for
music
for
a
long
spell
and
i
allow
to
fix
her
up
with
something
in
that
line
right
away
the
sheep
sheared
six
pounds
all
round
this
fall
and
i
going
to
get
marilla
an
instrument
if
it
takes
the
price
of
the
whole
clip
to
do
it
says
i
little
girl
deserves
it
going
to
san
antone
on
the
last
load
of
wool
says
uncle
cal
select
an
instrument
for
her
myself
it
be
better
i
suggests
take
marilla
along
and
let
her
pick
out
one
that
she
likes
i
might
have
known
that
would
set
uncle
cal
going
of
course
a
man
like
him
that
knew
everything
about
everything
would
look
at
that
as
a
reflection
on
his
attainments
sir
it
would
says
he
pulling
at
his
white
whiskers
ai
a
better
judge
of
musical
instruments
in
the
whole
world
than
what
i
am
i
had
an
uncle
says
he
was
a
partner
in
a
and
i
seen
thousands
of
put
together
i
know
all
about
musical
instruments
from
a
to
a
fiddle
there
ai
a
man
lives
sir
that
can
tell
me
any
news
about
any
instrument
that
has
to
be
pounded
blowed
scraped
grinded
picked
or
wound
with
a
key
get
me
what
you
like
dad
says
marilla
who
could
keep
her
feet
on
the
floor
from
joy
course
you
know
what
to
select
just
as
lief
it
was
a
piano
or
a
organ
or
what
see
in
louis
once
what
they
call
a
orchestrion
says
uncle
cal
i
judged
was
about
the
finest
thing
in
the
way
of
music
ever
invented
but
there
ai
room
in
this
house
for
one
anyway
i
imagine
they
cost
a
thousand
dollars
i
reckon
something
in
the
piano
line
would
suit
marilla
the
best
she
took
lessons
in
that
respect
for
two
years
over
at
birdstail
i
would
trust
the
buying
of
an
instrument
to
anybody
else
but
myself
i
reckon
if
i
had
took
up
i
have
been
one
of
the
finest
composers
or
manufacturers
in
the
world
that
was
uncle
cal
style
but
i
never
lost
any
patience
with
him
on
account
of
his
thinking
so
much
of
marilla
and
she
thought
just
as
much
of
him
he
sent
her
to
the
academy
over
at
birdstail
for
two
years
when
it
took
nearly
every
pound
of
wool
to
pay
the
expenses
along
about
tuesday
uncle
cal
put
out
for
san
antone
on
the
last
wagonload
of
wool
marilla
uncle
ben
who
lived
in
birdstail
come
over
and
stayed
at
the
ranch
while
uncle
cal
was
gone
it
was
ninety
miles
to
san
antone
and
forty
to
the
nearest
station
so
uncle
cal
was
gone
about
four
days
i
was
over
at
the
when
he
came
rolling
back
one
evening
about
sundown
and
up
there
in
the
wagon
sure
enough
was
a
piano
or
a
organ
we
tell
which
all
wrapped
up
in
woolsacks
with
a
tied
over
it
in
case
of
rain
and
out
skips
marilla
hollering
oh
with
her
eyes
shining
and
her
hair
dad
she
sings
out
you
brought
it
have
you
brought
it
and
it
right
there
before
her
eyes
as
women
will
do
piano
in
san
antone
says
uncle
cal
waving
his
hand
proud
rosewood
and
the
finest
loudest
tone
you
ever
listened
to
i
heard
the
storekeeper
play
it
and
i
took
it
on
the
spot
and
paid
cash
down
me
and
ben
and
uncle
cal
and
a
mexican
lifted
it
out
of
the
wagon
and
carried
it
in
the
house
and
set
it
in
a
corner
it
was
one
of
them
upright
instruments
and
not
very
heavy
or
very
big
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
uncle
cal
flops
over
and
says
he
mighty
sick
he
got
a
high
fever
and
he
complains
of
his
lungs
he
gets
into
bed
while
me
and
ben
goes
out
to
unhitch
and
put
the
horses
in
the
pasture
and
marilla
flies
around
to
get
uncle
cal
something
hot
to
drink
but
first
she
puts
both
arms
on
that
piano
and
hugs
it
with
a
soft
kind
of
a
smile
like
you
see
kids
doing
with
their
christmas
toys
when
i
came
in
from
the
pasture
marilla
was
in
the
room
where
the
piano
was
i
could
see
by
the
strings
and
woolsacks
on
the
floor
that
she
had
had
it
unwrapped
but
now
she
was
tying
the
over
it
again
and
there
was
a
kind
of
solemn
whitish
look
on
her
face
wrapping
up
the
music
again
are
you
marilla
i
asks
the
matter
with
just
a
couple
of
tunes
for
to
see
how
she
goes
under
the
saddle
rush
says
she
do
want
to
play
any
dad
too
sick
just
think
rush
he
paid
three
hundred
dollars
for
it
nearly
a
third
of
what
the
brought
it
ai
anyways
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
third
of
what
you
are
worth
i
told
her
i
do
think
uncle
cal
is
too
sick
to
hear
a
little
agitation
of
the
just
to
christen
the
machine
rush
says
marilla
in
a
way
that
she
had
when
she
wanted
to
settle
things
but
it
seems
that
uncle
cal
was
plenty
sick
after
all
he
got
so
bad
that
ben
saddled
up
and
rode
over
to
birdstail
for
doc
simpson
i
stayed
around
to
see
if
i
be
needed
for
anything
when
uncle
cal
pain
let
up
on
him
a
little
he
called
marilla
and
says
to
her
you
look
at
your
instrument
honey
and
do
you
like
it
lovely
dad
says
she
leaning
down
by
his
pillow
never
saw
one
so
pretty
how
dear
and
good
it
was
of
you
to
buy
it
for
me
have
heard
you
play
on
it
any
yet
says
uncle
cal
been
listening
my
side
do
hurt
quite
so
bad
now
wo
you
play
a
piece
marilla
but
no
she
puts
uncle
cal
off
and
soothes
him
down
like
you
seen
women
do
with
a
kid
it
seems
she
made
up
her
mind
not
to
touch
that
piano
at
present
when
doc
simpson
comes
over
he
tells
us
that
uncle
cal
has
pneumonia
the
worst
kind
and
as
the
old
man
was
past
sixty
and
nearly
on
the
lift
anyhow
the
odds
was
against
his
walking
on
grass
any
more
on
the
fourth
day
of
his
sickness
he
calls
for
marilla
again
and
wants
to
talk
piano
doc
simpson
was
there
and
so
was
ben
and
ben
trying
to
do
all
they
could
have
made
a
wonderful
success
in
anything
connected
with
music
says
uncle
cal
got
the
finest
instrument
for
the
money
in
san
antone
ai
that
piano
all
right
in
every
respect
marilla
just
perfect
dad
says
she
got
the
finest
tone
i
ever
heard
but
do
you
think
you
could
sleep
a
little
while
now
dad
i
do
says
uncle
cal
want
to
hear
that
piano
i
believe
you
even
tried
it
yet
i
went
all
the
way
to
san
antone
and
picked
it
out
for
you
myself
it
took
a
third
of
the
fall
clip
to
buy
it
but
i
do
mind
that
if
it
makes
my
good
girl
happier
wo
you
play
a
little
bit
for
dad
marilla
doc
simpson
beckoned
marilla
to
one
side
and
recommended
her
to
do
what
uncle
cal
wanted
so
it
would
get
him
quieted
and
her
uncle
ben
and
his
wife
asked
her
too
not
hit
out
a
tune
or
two
with
the
soft
pedal
on
i
asks
marilla
cal
has
begged
you
so
often
it
would
please
him
a
good
deal
to
hear
you
touch
up
the
piano
he
bought
for
you
you
think
you
might
but
marilla
stands
there
with
big
tears
rolling
down
from
her
eyes
and
says
nothing
and
then
she
runs
over
and
slips
her
arm
under
uncle
cal
neck
and
hugs
him
tight
last
night
dad
we
heard
her
say
played
it
ever
so
much
honest
i
have
been
playing
it
and
it
such
a
splendid
instrument
you
do
know
how
i
love
it
last
night
i
played
bonnie
dundee
and
the
anvil
polka
and
the
blue
danube
and
lots
of
pieces
you
must
surely
have
heard
me
playing
a
little
did
you
dad
i
did
like
to
play
loud
when
you
was
so
sick
well
says
uncle
cal
i
did
maybe
i
did
and
forgot
about
it
my
head
is
a
little
cranky
at
times
i
heard
the
man
in
the
store
play
it
fine
i
mighty
glad
you
like
it
marilla
yes
i
believe
i
could
go
to
sleep
a
while
if
you
stay
right
beside
me
till
i
do
there
was
where
marilla
had
me
guessing
much
as
she
thought
of
that
old
man
she
would
strike
a
note
on
that
piano
that
he
bought
her
i
could
imagine
why
she
told
him
she
been
playing
it
for
the
had
ever
been
off
of
it
since
she
put
it
back
on
the
same
day
it
come
i
knew
she
could
play
a
little
anyhow
for
once
heard
her
snatch
some
pretty
fair
out
of
an
old
piano
at
the
charco
largo
ranch
well
in
about
a
week
the
pneumonia
got
the
best
of
uncle
cal
they
had
the
funeral
over
at
birdstail
and
all
of
us
went
over
i
brought
marilla
back
home
in
my
buckboard
her
uncle
ben
and
his
wife
were
going
to
stay
there
a
few
days
with
her
that
night
marilla
takes
me
in
the
room
where
the
piano
was
while
the
others
were
out
on
the
gallery
here
rush
says
she
want
you
to
see
this
now
she
unties
the
rope
and
drags
off
the
if
you
ever
rode
a
saddle
without
a
horse
or
fired
off
a
gun
that
was
loaded
or
took
a
drink
out
of
an
empty
bottle
why
then
you
might
have
been
able
to
scare
an
opera
or
two
out
of
the
instrument
uncle
cal
had
bought
instead
of
a
piano
it
was
one
of
the
machines
they
invented
to
play
the
piano
with
by
itself
it
was
about
as
musical
as
the
holes
of
a
flute
without
the
flute
and
that
was
the
piano
that
uncle
cal
had
selected
and
standing
by
it
was
the
good
fine
girl
that
never
let
him
know
it
and
what
you
heard
playing
a
while
ago
concluded
kinney
was
that
same
machine
only
just
at
present
it
shoved
up
against
a
piano
that
i
bought
for
marilla
as
soon
as
we
was
married
xiv
a
call
loan
in
those
days
the
cattlemen
were
the
anointed
they
were
the
grandees
of
the
grass
kings
of
the
kine
lords
of
the
lea
barons
of
beef
and
bone
they
might
have
ridden
in
golden
chariots
had
their
tastes
so
inclined
the
cattleman
was
caught
in
a
stampede
of
dollars
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
more
money
than
was
decent
but
when
he
had
bought
a
watch
with
precious
stones
set
in
the
case
so
large
that
they
hurt
his
ribs
and
a
california
saddle
with
silver
nails
and
angora
skin
and
ordered
everybody
up
to
the
bar
for
whisky
what
else
was
there
for
him
to
spend
money
for
not
so
circumscribed
in
expedient
for
the
reduction
of
surplus
wealth
were
those
lairds
of
the
lariat
who
had
womenfolk
to
their
name
in
the
breast
of
the
sex
the
genius
of
purse
lightening
may
slumber
through
years
of
inopportunity
but
never
my
brothers
does
it
become
extinct
so
out
of
the
chaparral
came
long
bill
longley
from
the
bar
circle
branch
on
the
frio
a
man
to
taste
the
urban
joys
of
success
something
like
half
a
million
dollars
he
had
with
an
income
steadily
increasing
long
bill
was
a
graduate
of
the
camp
and
trail
luck
and
thrift
a
cool
head
and
a
telescopic
eye
for
mavericks
had
raised
him
from
cowboy
to
be
a
cowman
then
came
the
boom
in
cattle
and
fortune
stepping
gingerly
among
the
cactus
thorns
came
and
emptied
her
cornucopia
at
the
doorstep
of
the
ranch
in
the
little
frontier
city
of
chaparosa
longley
built
a
costly
residence
here
he
became
a
captive
bound
to
the
chariot
of
social
existence
he
was
doomed
to
become
a
leading
citizen
he
struggled
for
a
time
like
a
mustang
in
his
first
corral
and
then
he
hung
up
his
quirt
and
spurs
time
hung
heavily
on
his
hands
he
organised
the
first
national
bank
of
chaparosa
and
was
elected
its
president
one
day
a
dyspeptic
man
wearing
glasses
inserted
an
card
between
the
bars
of
the
cashier
window
of
the
first
national
bank
five
minutes
later
the
bank
force
was
dancing
at
the
beck
and
call
of
a
national
bank
examiner
this
examiner
edgar
todd
proved
to
be
a
thorough
one
at
the
end
of
it
all
the
examiner
put
on
his
hat
and
called
the
president
william
longley
into
the
private
office
well
how
do
you
find
things
asked
longley
in
his
slow
deep
tones
any
brands
in
the
you
did
like
the
looks
of
the
bank
checks
up
all
right
longley
said
todd
and
i
find
your
loans
in
very
good
shape
with
one
exception
you
are
carrying
one
very
bad
bit
of
paper
one
that
is
so
bad
that
i
have
been
thinking
that
you
surely
do
not
realise
the
serious
position
it
places
you
in
i
refer
to
a
call
loan
of
made
to
thomas
merwin
not
only
is
the
amount
in
excess
of
the
maximum
sum
the
bank
can
loan
any
individual
legally
but
it
is
absolutely
without
endorsement
or
security
thus
you
have
doubly
violated
the
national
banking
laws
and
have
laid
yourself
open
to
criminal
prosecution
by
the
government
a
report
of
the
matter
to
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
which
i
am
bound
to
make
would
i
am
sure
result
in
the
matter
being
turned
over
to
the
department
of
justice
for
action
you
see
what
a
serious
thing
it
is
bill
longley
was
leaning
his
lengthy
slowly
moving
frame
back
in
his
swivel
chair
his
hands
were
clasped
behind
his
head
and
he
turned
a
little
to
look
the
examiner
in
the
face
the
examiner
was
surprised
to
see
a
smile
creep
about
the
rugged
mouth
of
the
banker
and
a
kindly
twinkle
in
his
eyes
if
he
saw
the
seriousness
of
the
affair
it
did
not
show
in
his
countenance
of
course
you
do
know
tom
merwin
said
longley
almost
genially
yes
i
know
about
that
loan
it
has
any
security
except
tom
merwin
word
somehow
i
always
found
that
when
a
man
word
is
good
it
the
best
security
there
is
oh
yes
i
know
the
government
does
think
so
i
guess
i
see
tom
about
that
note
todd
dyspepsia
seemed
to
grow
suddenly
worse
he
looked
at
the
chaparral
banker
through
his
glasses
in
amazement
you
see
said
longley
easily
explaining
the
thing
away
tom
heard
of
head
of
down
near
rocky
ford
on
the
rio
grande
that
could
be
had
for
a
head
i
reckon
was
one
of
old
leandro
garcia
outfits
that
he
had
smuggled
over
and
he
wanted
to
make
a
quick
turn
on
those
cattle
are
worth
on
the
hoof
in
kansas
city
tom
knew
it
and
i
knew
it
he
had
and
i
let
him
have
the
to
make
the
deal
with
his
brother
ed
took
on
to
market
three
weeks
ago
he
ought
to
be
back
any
day
now
with
the
money
when
he
comes
tom
pay
that
note
the
bank
examiner
was
shocked
it
was
perhaps
his
duty
to
step
out
to
the
telegraph
office
and
wire
the
situation
to
the
comptroller
but
he
did
not
he
talked
pointedly
and
effectively
to
longley
for
three
minutes
he
succeeded
in
making
the
banker
understand
that
he
stood
upon
the
border
of
a
catastrophe
and
then
he
offered
a
tiny
loophole
of
escape
i
am
going
to
hilldale
he
told
longley
to
examine
a
bank
there
i
will
pass
through
chaparosa
on
my
way
back
at
twelve
i
shall
call
at
this
bank
if
this
loan
has
been
cleared
out
of
the
way
by
that
time
it
will
not
be
mentioned
in
my
report
if
not
i
will
have
to
do
my
duty
with
that
the
examiner
bowed
and
departed
the
president
of
the
first
national
lounged
in
his
chair
half
an
hour
longer
and
then
he
lit
a
mild
cigar
and
went
over
to
tom
house
merwin
a
ranchman
in
brown
duck
with
a
contemplative
eye
sat
with
his
feet
upon
a
table
plaiting
a
rawhide
quirt
tom
said
longley
leaning
against
the
table
you
heard
anything
from
ed
yet
not
yet
said
merwin
continuing
his
plaiting
i
guess
ed
be
along
back
now
in
a
few
days
there
was
a
bank
examiner
said
longley
nosing
around
our
place
and
he
bucked
a
sight
about
that
note
of
yours
you
know
i
know
it
all
right
but
the
thing
against
the
banking
laws
i
was
pretty
sure
you
have
paid
it
off
before
the
bank
was
examined
again
but
the
slipped
in
on
us

longley
hesitated

with
both
of
uncle
sam
feet
i
try
to
raise
the
money
for
you
on
time
said
merwin
interested
in
his
plaiting
all
right
tom
concluded
longley
as
he
turned
toward
the
door
i
knew
you
would
if
you
could
merwin
threw
down
his
whip
and
went
to
the
only
other

merwin
went
back
to
his
little
bare
office
and
plaited
at
his
quirt
again
about
four
in
the
afternoon
he
went
to
the
first
national
bank
and
leaned
over
the
railing
of
longley
desk
i
try
to
get
that
money
for
you
i
mean
bill
all
right
tom
said
longley
quietly
at
nine
that
night
tom
merwin
stepped
cautiously
out
of
the
small
frame
house
in
which
he
lived
it
was
near
the
edge
of
the
little
town
and
few
citizens
were
in
the
neighbourhood
at
that
hour
merwin
wore
two
in
a
belt
and
a
slouch
hat
he
moved
swiftly
down
a
lonely
street
and
then
followed
the
sandy
road
that
ran
parallel
to
the
track
until
he
reached
the
tank
two
miles
below
the
town
there
tom
merwin
stopped
tied
a
black
silk
handkerchief
about
the
lower
part
of
his
face
and
pulled
his
hat
down
low
in
ten
minutes
the
night
train
for
rockdell
pulled
up
at
the
tank
having
come
from
chaparosa
with
a
gun
in
each
hand
merwin
raised
himself
from
behind
a
clump
of
chaparral
and
started
for
the
engine
but
before
he
had
taken
three
steps
two
long
strong
arms
clasped
him
from
behind
and
he
was
lifted
from
his
feet
and
thrown
face
downward
upon
the
grass
there
was
a
heavy
knee
pressing
against
his
back
and
an
iron
hand
grasping
each
of
his
wrists
he
was
held
thus
like
a
child
until
the
engine
had
taken
water
and
until
the
train
had
moved
with
accelerating
speed
out
of
sight
then
he
was
released
and
rose
to
his
feet
to
face
bill
longley
the
case
never
needed
to
be
fixed
up
this
way
tom
said
longley
i
saw
cooper
this
evening
and
he
told
me
what
you
and
him
talked
about
then
i
went
down
to
your
house
and
saw
you
come
out
with
your
guns
on
and
i
followed
you
let
go
back
tom
they
walked
away
together
side
by
side
was
the
only
chance
i
saw
said
merwin
presently
you
called
your
loan
and
i
tried
to
answer
you
now
what
you
do
bill
if
they
sock
it
to
you
what
would
you
have
done
if
they
socked
it
to
you
was
the
answer
longley
made
i
never
thought
i
lay
in
a
bush
to
stick
up
a
train
remarked
merwin
but
a
call
loan
different
a
call
a
call
with
me
got
twelve
hours
yet
bill
before
this
spy
jumps
onto
you
we
got
to
raise
them
spondulicks
somehow
maybe
we
can
great
sam
houston
do
you
hear
that
merwin
broke
into
a
run
and
longley
kept
with
him
hearing
only
a
rather
pleasing
whistle
somewhere
in
the
night
rendering
the
lugubrious
air
of
the
cowboy
lament
it
the
only
tune
he
knows
shouted
merwin
as
he
ran
i
bet
they
were
at
the
door
of
merwin
house
he
kicked
it
open
and
fell
over
an
old
valise
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
a
sunburned
youth
stained
by
travel
lay
upon
the
bed
puffing
at
a
brown
cigarette
what
the
word
ed
gasped
merwin
so
so
drawled
that
capable
youngster
just
got
in
on
the
sold
the
bunch
for
fifteen
straight
now
buddy
you
want
to
quit
kickin
a
valise
around
that
got
in
greenbacks
in
its
xv
the
princess
and
the
puma
there
had
to
be
a
king
and
queen
of
course
the
king
was
a
terrible
old
man
who
wore
and
spurs
and
shouted
in
such
a
tremendous
voice
that
the
rattlers
on
the
prairie
would
run
into
their
holes
under
the
prickly
pear
before
there
was
a
royal
family
they
called
the
man
whispering
ben
when
he
came
to
own
acres
of
land
and
more
cattle
than
he
could
count
they
called
him
the
cattle
king
the
queen
had
been
a
mexican
girl
from
laredo
she
made
a
good
mild
wife
and
even
succeeded
in
teaching
ben
to
modify
his
voice
sufficiently
while
in
the
house
to
keep
the
dishes
from
being
broken
when
ben
got
to
be
king
she
would
sit
on
the
gallery
of
espinosa
ranch
and
weave
rush
mats
when
wealth
became
so
irresistible
and
oppressive
that
upholstered
chairs
and
a
centre
table
were
brought
down
from
san
antone
in
the
wagons
she
bowed
her
smooth
dark
head
and
shared
the
fate
of
the
danae
to
avoid
you
have
been
presented
first
to
the
king
and
queen
they
do
not
enter
the
story
which
might
be
called
the
chronicle
of
the
princess
the
happy
thought
and
the
lion
that
bungled
his
job
josefa
was
the
surviving
daughter
the
princess
from
her
mother
she
inherited
warmth
of
nature
and
a
dusky
beauty
from
ben
the
royal
she
acquired
a
store
of
intrepidity
common
sense
and
the
faculty
of
ruling
the
combination
was
one
worth
going
miles
to
see
josefa
while
riding
her
pony
at
a
gallop
could
put
five
out
of
six
bullets
through
a
swinging
at
the
end
of
a
string
she
could
play
for
hours
with
a
white
kitten
she
owned
dressing
it
in
all
manner
of
absurd
clothes
scorning
a
pencil
she
could
tell
you
out
of
her
head
what
would
bring
on
the
hoof
at
per
head
roughly
speaking
the
espinosa
ranch
is
forty
miles
long
and
thirty
broad
but
mostly
leased
land
josefa
on
her
pony
had
prospected
over
every
mile
of
it
every
on
the
range
knew
her
by
sight
and
was
a
loyal
vassal
ripley
givens
foreman
of
one
of
the
espinosa
outfits
saw
her
one
day
and
made
up
his
mind
to
form
a
royal
matrimonial
alliance
presumptuous
no
in
those
days
in
the
nueces
country
a
man
was
a
man
and
after
all
the
title
of
cattle
king
does
not
presuppose
blood
royalty
often
it
only
signifies
that
its
owner
wears
the
crown
in
token
of
his
magnificent
qualities
in
the
art
of
cattle
stealing
one
day
ripley
givens
rode
over
to
the
double
elm
ranch
to
inquire
about
a
bunch
of
strayed
yearlings
he
was
late
in
setting
out
on
his
return
trip
and
it
was
sundown
when
he
struck
the
white
horse
crossing
of
the
nueces
from
there
to
his
own
camp
it
was
sixteen
miles
to
the
espinosa
ranch
it
was
twelve
givens
was
tired
he
decided
to
pass
the
night
at
the
crossing
there
was
a
fine
water
hole
in
the
the
banks
were
thickly
covered
with
great
trees
undergrown
with
brush
back
from
the
water
hole
fifty
yards
was
a
stretch
of
curly
mesquite
grass
supper
for
his
horse
and
bed
for
himself
givens
staked
his
horse
and
spread
out
his
saddle
blankets
to
dry
he
sat
down
with
his
back
against
a
tree
and
rolled
a
cigarette
from
somewhere
in
the
dense
timber
along
the
river
came
a
sudden
rageful
shivering
wail
the
pony
danced
at
the
end
of
his
rope
and
blew
a
whistling
snort
of
comprehending
fear
givens
puffed
at
his
cigarette
but
he
reached
leisurely
for
his
which
lay
on
the
grass
and
twirled
the
cylinder
of
his
weapon
tentatively
a
great
gar
plunged
with
a
loud
splash
into
the
water
hole
a
little
brown
rabbit
skipped
around
a
bunch
of
catclaw
and
sat
twitching
his
whiskers
and
looking
humorously
at
givens
the
pony
went
on
eating
grass
it
is
well
to
be
reasonably
watchful
when
a
mexican
lion
sings
soprano
along
the
arroyos
at
sundown
the
burden
of
his
song
may
be
that
young
calves
and
fat
lambs
are
scarce
and
that
he
has
a
carnivorous
desire
for
your
acquaintance
in
the
grass
lay
an
empty
fruit
can
cast
there
by
some
former
sojourner
givens
caught
sight
of
it
with
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
in
his
coat
pocket
tied
behind
his
saddle
was
a
handful
or
two
of
ground
coffee
black
coffee
and
cigarettes
what
ranchero
could
desire
more
in
two
minutes
he
had
a
little
fire
going
clearly
he
started
with
his
can
for
the
water
hole
when
within
fifteen
yards
of
its
edge
he
saw
between
the
bushes
a
pony
with
reins
cropping
grass
a
little
distance
to
his
left
just
rising
from
her
hands
and
knees
on
the
brink
of
the
water
hole
was
josefa
she
had
been
drinking
water
and
she
brushed
the
sand
from
the
palms
of
her
hands
ten
yards
away
to
her
right
half
concealed
by
a
clump
of
sacuista
givens
saw
the
crouching
form
of
the
mexican
lion
his
amber
eyeballs
glared
hungrily
six
feet
from
them
was
the
tip
of
the
tail
stretched
straight
like
a
pointer
his
rocked
with
the
motion
of
the
cat
tribe
preliminary
to
leaping
givens
did
what
he
could
his
was
yards
away
lying
on
the
grass
he
gave
a
loud
yell
and
dashed
between
the
lion
and
the
princess
the
rucus
as
givens
called
it
afterward
was
brief
and
somewhat
confused
when
he
arrived
on
the
line
of
attack
he
saw
a
dim
streak
in
the
air
and
heard
a
couple
of
faint
cracks
then
a
hundred
pounds
of
mexican
lion
plumped
down
upon
his
head
and
flattened
him
with
a
heavy
jar
to
the
ground
he
remembered
calling
out
let
up
now
no
fair
gouging
and
then
he
crawled
from
under
the
lion
like
a
worm
with
his
mouth
full
of
grass
and
dirt
and
a
big
lump
on
the
back
of
his
head
where
it
had
struck
the
root
of
a
the
lion
lay
motionless
givens
feeling
aggrieved
and
suspicious
of
fouls
shook
his
fist
at
the
lion
and
shouted
i
rastle
you
again
for
twenty
and
then
he
got
back
to
himself
josefa
was
standing
in
her
tracks
quietly
reloading
her
mounted
it
had
not
been
a
difficult
shot
the
lion
head
made
an
easier
mark
than
a
swinging
at
the
end
of
a
string
there
was
a
provoking
teasing
maddening
smile
upon
her
mouth
and
in
her
dark
eyes
the
knight
felt
the
fire
of
his
fiasco
burn
down
to
his
soul
here
had
been
his
chance
the
chance
that
he
had
dreamed
of
and
momus
and
not
cupid
had
presided
over
it
the
satyrs
in
the
wood
were
no
doubt
holding
their
sides
in
hilarious
silent
laughter
there
had
been
something
like
vaudeville
say
signor
givens
and
his
funny
knockabout
act
with
the
stuffed
lion
is
that
you
mr
givens
said
josefa
in
her
deliberate
saccharine
contralto
you
nearly
spoilt
my
shot
when
you
yelled
did
you
hurt
your
head
when
you
fell
oh
no
said
givens
quietly
that
did
hurt
he
stooped
ignominiously
and
dragged
his
best
stetson
hat
from
under
the
beast
it
was
crushed
and
wrinkled
to
a
fine
comedy
effect
then
he
knelt
down
and
softly
stroked
the
fierce
head
of
the
dead
lion
poor
old
bill
he
exclaimed
mournfully
what
that
asked
josefa
sharply
of
course
you
did
know
miss
josefa
said
givens
with
an
air
of
one
allowing
magnanimity
to
triumph
over
grief
nobody
can
blame
you
i
tried
to
save
him
but
i
could
let
you
know
in
time
save
who
why
bill
i
been
looking
for
him
all
day
you
see
he
been
our
camp
pet
for
two
years
poor
old
fellow
he
would
have
hurt
a
cottontail
rabbit
it
break
the
boys
all
up
when
they
hear
about
it
but
you
could
tell
of
course
that
bill
was
just
trying
to
play
with
you
josefa
black
eyes
burned
steadily
upon
him
ripley
givens
met
the
test
successfully
he
stood
rumpling
the
curls
on
his
head
pensively
in
his
eye
was
regret
not
unmingled
with
a
gentle
reproach
his
smooth
features
were
set
to
a
pattern
of
indisputable
sorrow
josefa
wavered
what
was
your
pet
doing
here
she
asked
making
a
last
stand
there
no
camp
near
the
white
horse
crossing
the
old
rascal
ran
away
from
camp
yesterday
answered
givens
readily
it
a
wonder
the
coyotes
did
scare
him
to
death
you
see
jim
webster
our
horse
wrangler
brought
a
little
terrier
pup
into
camp
last
week
the
pup
made
life
miserable
for
bill
he
used
to
chase
him
around
and
chew
his
hind
legs
for
hours
at
a
time
every
night
when
bedtime
came
bill
would
sneak
under
one
of
the
blankets
and
sleep
to
keep
the
pup
from
finding
him
i
reckon
he
must
have
been
worried
pretty
desperate
or
he
would
have
run
away
he
was
always
afraid
to
get
out
of
sight
of
camp
josefa
looked
at
the
body
of
the
fierce
animal
givens
gently
patted
one
of
the
formidable
paws
that
could
have
killed
a
yearling
calf
with
one
blow
slowly
a
red
flush
widened
upon
the
dark
olive
face
of
the
girl
was
it
the
signal
of
shame
of
the
true
sportsman
who
has
brought
down
ignoble
quarry
her
eyes
grew
softer
and
the
lowered
lids
drove
away
all
their
bright
mockery
i
very
sorry
she
said
humbly
but
he
looked
so
big
and
jumped
so
high
that
poor
old
bill
was
hungry
interrupted
givens
in
quick
defence
of
the
deceased
we
always
made
him
jump
for
his
supper
in
camp
he
would
lie
down
and
roll
over
for
a
piece
of
meat
when
he
saw
you
he
thought
he
was
going
to
get
something
to
eat
from
you
suddenly
josefa
eyes
opened
wide
i
might
have
shot
you
she
exclaimed
you
ran
right
in
between
you
risked
your
life
to
save
your
pet
that
was
fine
givens
i
like
a
man
who
is
kind
to
animals
yes
there
was
even
admiration
in
her
gaze
now
after
all
there
was
a
hero
rising
out
of
the
ruins
of
the
the
look
on
face
would
have
secured
him
a
high
position
in
the
i
always
loved
said
he
horses
dogs
mexican
lions
cows
alligators
i
hate
alligators
instantly
demurred
josefa
crawly
muddy
things
did
i
say
alligators
said
givens
i
meant
antelopes
of
course
josefa
conscience
drove
her
to
make
further
amends
she
held
out
her
hand
penitently
there
was
a
bright
unshed
drop
in
each
of
her
eyes
please
forgive
me
givens
wo
you
i
only
a
girl
you
know
and
i
was
frightened
at
first
i
very
very
sorry
i
shot
bill
you
do
know
how
ashamed
i
feel
i
would
have
done
it
for
anything
givens
took
the
proffered
hand
he
held
it
for
a
time
while
he
allowed
the
generosity
of
his
nature
to
overcome
his
grief
at
the
loss
of
bill
at
last
it
was
clear
that
he
had
forgiven
her
please
do
speak
of
it
any
more
miss
josefa
was
enough
to
frighten
any
young
lady
the
way
bill
looked
i
explain
it
all
right
to
the
boys
are
you
really
sure
you
do
hate
me
josefa
came
closer
to
him
impulsively
her
eyes
were
sweet
oh
sweet
and
pleading
with
gracious
penitence
i
would
hate
anyone
who
would
kill
my
kitten
and
how
daring
and
kind
of
you
to
risk
being
shot
when
you
tried
to
save
him
how
very
few
men
would
have
done
that
victory
wrested
from
defeat
vaudeville
turned
into
drama
bravo
ripley
givens
it
was
now
twilight
of
course
miss
josefa
could
not
be
allowed
to
ride
on
to
the
alone
givens
resaddled
his
pony
in
spite
of
that
animal
reproachful
glances
and
rode
with
her
side
by
side
they
galloped
across
the
smooth
grass
the
princess
and
the
man
who
was
kind
to
animals
the
prairie
odours
of
fruitful
earth
and
delicate
bloom
were
thick
and
sweet
around
them
coyotes
yelping
over
there
on
the
hill
no
fear
and
yet
josefa
rode
closer
a
little
hand
seemed
to
grope
givens
found
it
with
his
own
the
ponies
kept
an
even
gait
the
hands
lingered
together
and
the
owner
of
one
explained
i
never
was
frightened
before
but
just
think
how
terrible
it
would
be
to
meet
a
really
wild
lion
poor
bill
i
so
glad
you
came
with
me
was
sitting
on
the
ranch
gallery
hello
rip
he
shouted
that
you
he
rode
in
with
me
said
josefa
i
lost
my
way
and
was
late
much
obliged
called
the
cattle
king
stop
over
rip
and
ride
to
camp
in
the
morning
but
givens
would
not
he
would
push
on
to
camp
there
was
a
bunch
of
steers
to
start
off
on
the
trail
at
daybreak
he
said
and
trotted
away
an
hour
later
when
the
lights
were
out
josefa
in
her
came
to
her
door
and
called
to
the
king
in
his
own
room
across
the
hallway
say
pop
you
know
that
old
mexican
lion
they
call
the
devil
the
one
that
killed
gonzales
martin
sheep
herder
and
about
fifty
calves
on
the
salado
range
well
i
settled
his
hash
this
afternoon
over
at
the
white
horse
crossing
put
two
balls
in
his
head
with
my
while
he
was
on
the
jump
i
knew
him
by
the
slice
gone
from
his
left
ear
that
old
gonzales
cut
off
with
his
machete
you
could
have
made
a
better
shot
yourself
daddy
bully
for
you
thundered
whispering
ben
from
the
darkness
of
the
royal
chamber
xvi
the
indian
summer
of
dry
valley
johnson
dry
valley
johnson
shook
the
bottle
you
have
to
shake
the
bottle
before
using
for
sulphur
will
not
dissolve
then
dry
valley
saturated
a
small
sponge
with
the
liquid
and
rubbed
it
carefully
into
the
roots
of
his
hair
besides
sulphur
there
was
sugar
of
lead
in
it
and
tincture
of
nux
vomica
and
bay
rum
dry
valley
found
the
recipe
in
a
sunday
newspaper
you
must
next
be
told
why
a
strong
man
came
to
fall
a
victim
to
a
beauty
hint
dry
valley
had
been
a
sheepman
his
real
name
was
hector
but
he
had
been
rechristened
after
his
range
to
distinguish
him
from
elm
creek
johnson
who
ran
sheep
further
down
the
frio
many
years
of
living
face
to
face
with
sheep
on
their
own
terms
wearied
dry
valley
johnson
so
he
sold
his
ranch
for
eighteen
thousand
dollars
and
moved
to
santa
rosa
to
live
a
life
of
gentlemanly
ease
being
a
silent
and
melancholy
person
of
or
perhaps
he
soon
became
that
cursed
and
thing
an
elderlyish
bachelor
with
a
hobby
some
one
gave
him
his
first
strawberry
to
eat
and
he
was
done
for
dry
valley
bought
a
cottage
in
the
village
and
a
library
on
strawberry
culture
behind
the
cottage
was
a
garden
of
which
he
made
a
strawberry
patch
in
his
old
grey
woolen
shirt
his
brown
duck
trousers
and
boots
he
sprawled
all
day
on
a
canvas
cot
under
a
tree
at
his
back
door
studying
the
history
of
the
seductive
scarlet
berry
the
school
teacher
miss
de
witt
spoke
of
him
as
a
fine
presentable
man
for
all
his
middle
age
but
the
focus
of
dry
valley
eyes
embraced
no
women
they
were
merely
beings
who
flew
skirts
as
a
signal
for
him
to
lift
awkwardly
his
heavy
felt
stetson
whenever
he
met
them
and
then
hurry
past
to
get
back
to
his
beloved
berries
and
all
this
recitative
by
the
chorus
is
only
to
bring
us
to
the
point
where
you
may
be
told
why
dry
valley
shook
up
the
insoluble
sulphur
in
the
bottle
so
and
inconsequential
a
thing
is
history
the
anamorphous
shadow
of
a
milestone
reaching
down
the
road
between
us
and
the
setting
sun
when
his
strawberries
were
beginning
to
ripen
dry
valley
bought
the
heaviest
buggy
whip
in
the
santa
rosa
store
he
sat
for
many
hours
under
the
live
oak
tree
plaiting
and
weaving
in
an
extension
to
its
lash
when
it
was
done
he
could
snip
a
leaf
from
a
bush
twenty
feet
away
with
the
cracker
for
the
bright
predatory
eyes
of
santa
rosa
youth
were
watching
the
ripening
berries
and
dry
valley
was
arming
himself
against
their
expected
raids
no
greater
care
had
he
taken
of
his
tender
lambs
during
his
ranching
days
than
he
did
of
his
cherished
fruit
warding
it
from
the
hungry
wolves
that
whistled
and
howled
and
shot
their
marbles
and
peered
through
the
fence
that
surrounded
his
property
in
the
house
next
to
dry
valley
lived
a
widow
with
a
pack
of
children
that
gave
the
husbandman
frequent
anxious
misgivings
in
the
woman
there
was
a
strain
of
the
spanish
she
had
wedded
one
of
the
name
of
dry
valley
was
a
connoisseur
in
cross
strains
and
he
foresaw
trouble
in
the
offspring
of
this
union
between
the
two
homesteads
ran
a
crazy
picket
fence
overgrown
with
morning
glory
and
wild
gourd
vines
often
he
could
see
little
heads
with
mops
of
black
hair
and
flashing
dark
eyes
dodging
in
and
out
between
the
pickets
keeping
tabs
on
the
reddening
berries
late
one
afternoon
dry
valley
went
to
the
post
office
when
he
came
back
like
mother
hubbard
he
found
the
deuce
to
pay
the
descendants
of
iberian
bandits
and
hibernian
cattle
raiders
had
swooped
down
upon
his
strawberry
patch
to
the
outraged
vision
of
dry
valley
there
seemed
to
be
a
sheep
corral
full
of
them
perhaps
they
numbered
five
or
six
between
the
rows
of
green
plants
they
were
stooped
hopping
about
like
toads
gobbling
silently
and
voraciously
his
finest
fruit
dry
valley
slipped
into
the
house
got
his
whip
and
charged
the
marauders
the
lash
curled
about
the
legs
of
the
nearest
a
greedy
before
they
knew
they
were
discovered
his
screech
gave
warning
and
the
flock
scampered
for
the
fence
like
a
drove
of
flushed
in
the
chaparral
dry
valley
whip
drew
a
toll
of
two
more
elfin
shrieks
before
they
dived
through
the
fence
and
disappeared
dry
valley
less
fleet
followed
them
nearly
to
the
pickets
checking
his
useless
pursuit
he
rounded
a
bush
dropped
his
whip
and
stood
voiceless
motionless
the
capacity
of
his
powers
consumed
by
the
act
of
breathing
and
preserving
the
perpendicular
behind
the
bush
stood
panchita
scorning
to
fly
she
was
nineteen
the
oldest
of
the
raiders
her
hair
was
gathered
back
in
a
wild
mass
and
tied
with
a
scarlet
ribbon
she
stood
with
reluctant
feet
yet
nearer
the
brook
than
to
the
river
for
childhood
had
environed
and
detained
her
she
looked
at
dry
valley
johnson
for
a
moment
with
magnificent
insolence
and
before
his
eyes
slowly
crunched
a
luscious
berry
between
her
white
teeth
then
she
turned
and
walked
slowly
to
the
fence
with
a
swaying
conscious
motion
such
as
a
duchess
might
make
use
of
in
leading
a
promenade
there
she
turned
again
and
grilled
dry
valley
johnson
once
more
in
the
dark
flame
of
her
audacious
eyes
laughed
a
trifle
and
twisted
herself
with
pantherish
quickness
between
the
pickets
to
the
side
of
the
wild
gourd
vine
dry
valley
picked
up
his
whip
and
went
into
his
house
he
stumbled
as
he
went
up
the
two
wooden
steps
the
old
mexican
woman
who
cooked
his
meals
and
swept
his
house
called
him
to
supper
as
he
went
through
the
rooms
dry
valley
went
on
stumbled
down
the
front
steps
out
the
gate
and
down
the
road
into
a
mesquite
thicket
at
the
edge
of
town
he
sat
down
in
the
grass
and
laboriously
plucked
the
spines
from
a
prickly
pear
one
by
one
this
was
his
attitude
of
thought
acquired
in
the
days
when
his
problems
were
only
those
of
wind
and
wool
and
water
a
thing
had
happened
to
the
man
a
thing
that
if
you
are
eligible
you
must
pray
may
pass
you
by
he
had
become
enveloped
in
the
indian
summer
of
the
soul
dry
valley
had
had
no
youth
even
his
childhood
had
been
one
of
dignity
and
seriousness
at
six
he
had
viewed
the
frivolous
gambols
of
the
lambs
on
his
father
ranch
with
silent
disapproval
his
life
as
a
young
man
had
been
wasted
the
divine
fires
and
impulses
the
glorious
exaltations
and
despairs
the
glow
and
enchantment
of
youth
had
passed
above
his
head
never
a
thrill
of
romeo
had
he
known
he
was
but
a
melancholy
jaques
of
the
forest
with
a
ruder
philosophy
lacking
the
flavour
of
experience
that
tempered
the
veteran
years
of
the
rugged
ranger
of
arden
and
now
in
his
sere
and
yellow
leaf
one
scornful
look
from
the
eyes
of
panchita
had
flooded
the
autumnal
landscape
with
a
tardy
and
delusive
summer
heat
but
a
sheepman
is
a
hardy
animal
dry
valley
johnson
had
weathered
too
many
northers
to
turn
his
back
on
a
late
summer
spiritual
or
real
old
he
would
show
them
by
the
next
mail
went
an
order
to
san
antonio
for
an
outfit
of
the
latest
clothes
colours
and
styles
and
prices
no
object
the
next
day
went
the
recipe
for
the
hair
restorer
clipped
from
a
newspaper
for

valley
sunburned
auburn
hair
was
beginning
to
turn
silvery
above
his
ears
dry
valley
kept
indoors
closely
for
a
week
except
for
frequent
sallies
after
youthful
strawberry
snatchers
then
a
few
days
later
he
suddenly
emerged
brilliantly
radiant
in
the
hectic
glow
of
his
belated
midsummer
madness
a
tennis
suit
covered
him
outwardly
almost
as
far
as
his
wrists
and
ankles
his
shirt
was
his
collar
winged
and
tall
his
necktie
a
floating
oriflamme
his
shoes
a
venomous
bright
tan
pointed
and
shaped
on
penitential
lasts
a
little
flat
straw
hat
with
a
striped
band
desecrated
his
head

protected
his
hands
from
the
benignant
may

this
sad
and
creature
teetered
out
of
its
den
smiling
foolishly
and
smoothing
its
gloves
for
men
and
angels
to
see
to
such
a
pass
had
dry

johnson
been
brought
by
cupid
who
always
shoots
game
that
is
out
of
season
with
an
arrow
from
the
quiver
of
momus
reconstructing
mythology
he
had
risen
a
prismatic
macaw
from
the
ashes
of
the
phoenix
that
had
folded
its
tired
wings
to
roost
under
the
trees
of

in
the

of
him
to
be
stunned
and
then
deliberately
and
slowly
as
his
shoes
required
entered
gate
not
until
the
eleven
months
drought
did
santa
rosa
cease
talking
about
dry
valley
johnson
courtship
of
panchita
it
was
an
unclassifiable
procedure
something
like
a
combination
of
walking
oratory
postage
stamp
flirtation
and
parlour
charades
it
lasted
two
weeks
and
then
came
to
a
sudden
end
of
course
favoured
the
match
as
soon
as
dry
intentions
were
disclosed
being
the
mother
of
a
woman
child
and
therefore
a
charter
member
of
the
ancient
order
of
the
she
joyfully
decked
out
panchita
for
the
sacrifice
the
girl
was
temporarily
dazzled
by
having
her
dresses
lengthened
and
her
hair
piled
up
on
her
head
and
came
near
forgetting
that
she
was
only
a
slice
of
cheese
it
was
nice
too
to
have
as
good
a
match
as
johnson
paying
you
attentions
and
to
see
the
other
girls
fluttering
the
curtains
at
their
windows
to
see
you
go
by
with
him
dry
valley
bought
a
buggy
with
yellow
wheels
and
a
fine
trotter
in
san
antonio
every
day
he
drove
out
with
panchita
he
was
never
seen
to
speak
to
her
when
they
were
walking
or
driving
the
consciousness
of
his
clothes
kept
his
mind
busy
the
knowledge
that
he
could
say
nothing
of
interest
kept
him
dumb
the
feeling
that
panchita
was
there
kept
him
happy
he
took
her
to
parties
and
dances
and
to
church
he
tried
oh
no
man
ever
tried
so
hard
to
be
young
as
dry
valley
did
he
could
not
dance
but
he
invented
a
smile
which
he
wore
on
these
joyous
occasions
a
smile
that
in
him
was
as
great
a
concession
to
mirth
and
gaiety
as
turning
would
be
in
another
he
began
to
seek
the
company
of
the
young
men
in
the
town
even
of
the
boys
they
accepted
him
as
a
decided
damper
for
his
attempts
at
sportiveness
were
so
forced
that
they
might
as
well
have
essayed
their
games
in
a
cathedral
neither
he
nor
any
other
could
estimate
what
progress
he
had
made
with
panchita
the
end
came
suddenly
in
one
day
as
often
disappears
the
false
afterglow
before
a
november
sky
and
wind
dry
valley
was
to
call
for
the
girl
one
afternoon
at
six
for
a
walk
an
afternoon
walk
in
santa
rosa
was
a
feature
of
social
life
that
called
for
the
pink
of
one
wardrobe
so
dry
valley
began
gorgeously
to
array
himself
and
so
early
that
he
finished
early
and
went
over
to
the
cottage
as
he
neared
the
porch
on
the
crooked
walk
from
the
gate
he
heard
sounds
of
revelry
within
he
stopped
and
looked
through
the
honeysuckle
vines
in
the
open
door
panchita
was
amusing
her
younger
brothers
and
sisters
she
wore
a
man
clothes
no
doubt
those
of
the
late
on
her
head
was
the
smallest
brother
straw
hat
decorated
with
an
paper
band
on
her
hands
were
flapping
yellow
cloth
gloves
roughly
cut
out
and
sewn
for
the
masquerade
the
same
material
covered
her
shoes
giving
them
the
semblance
of
tan
leather
high
collar
and
flowing
necktie
were
not
omitted
panchita
was
an
actress
dry
valley
saw
his
affectedly
youthful
gait
his
limp
where
the
right
shoe
hurt
him
his
forced
smile
his
awkward
simulation
of
a
gallant
air
all
reproduced
with
startling
fidelity
for
the
first
time
a
mirror
had
been
held
up
to
him
the
corroboration
of
one
of
the
youngsters
calling
mamma
come
and
see
pancha
do
like
johnson
was
not
needed
as
softly
as
the
caricatured
tans
would
permit
dry
valley
tiptoed
back
to
the
gate
and
home
again
twenty
minutes
after
the
time
appointed
for
the
walk
panchita
tripped
demurely
out
of
her
gate
in
a
thin
trim
white
lawn
and
sailor
hat
she
strolled
up
the
sidewalk
and
slowed
her
steps
at
dry
gate
her
manner
expressing
wonder
at
his
unusual
delinquency
then
out
of
his
door
and
down
the
walk
strode
not
the
polychromatic
victim
of
a
lost
summertime
but
the
sheepman
rehabilitated
he
wore
his
old
grey
woolen
shirt
open
at
the
throat
his
brown
duck
trousers
stuffed
into
his
boots
and
his
white
felt
sombrero
on
the
back
of
his
head
twenty
years
or
fifty
he
might
look
dry
valley
cared
not
his
light
blue
eyes
met
panchita
dark
ones
with
a
cold
flash
in
them
he
came
as
far
as
the
gate
he
pointed
with
his
long
arm
to
her
house
go
home
said
dry
valley
go
home
to
your
mother
i
wonder
lightnin
do

see
you
no
more
why
i
done
it
will
somebody
tell
me
go
home
and
let
me
try
and
forget
it
panchita
obeyed
and
walked
slowly
toward
her
home
saying
nothing
for
some
distance
she
kept
her
head
turned
and
her
large
eyes
fixed
intrepidly
upon
dry
valley
at
her
gate
she
stood
for
a
moment
looking
back
at
him
then
ran
suddenly
and
swiftly
into
the
house
old
antonia
was
building
a
fire
in
the
kitchen
stove
dry
valley
stopped
at
the
door
and
laughed
harshly
i
a
pretty
looking
old
rhinoceros
to
be
gettin
stuck
on
a
kid
ai
i
said
he
not
verree
good
thing
agreed
antonia
sagely
for
too
much
old
man
to
likee
you
bet
it
ai
said
dry
valley
grimly
it
dum
foolishness
and
besides
it
hurts
he
brought
at
one
armful
the
regalia
of
his
aberration
the
blue
tennis
suit
shoes
hat
gloves
and
all
and
threw
them
in
a
pile
at
antonia
feet
give
them
to
your
old
man
said
he
to
hunt
antelope
in
just
as
the
first
star
presided
palely
over
the
twilight
dry
valley
got
his
biggest
strawberry
book
and
sat
on
the
back
steps
to
catch
the
last
of
the
reading
light
he
thought
he
saw
the
figure
of
someone
in
his
strawberry
patch
he
laid
aside
the
book
got
his
whip
and
hurried
forth
to
see
it
was
panchita
she
had
slipped
through
the
picket
fence
and
was
across
the
patch
she
stopped
when
she
saw
him
and
looked
at
him
without
wavering
a
sudden
rage
a
humiliating
flush
of
unreasoning
wrath
came
over
dry
valley
for
this
child
he
had
made
himself
a
motley
to
the
view
he
had
tried
to
bribe
time
to
turn
backward
for
himself
he
had
been
made
a
fool
of
at
last
he
had
seen
his
folly
there
was
a
gulf
between
him
and
youth
over
which
he
could
not
build
a
bridge
even
with
yellow
gloves
to
protect
his
hands
and
the
sight
of
his
torment
coming
to
pester
him
with
her
elfin
pranks
coming
to
plunder
his
strawberry
vines
like
a
mischievous
schoolboy
roused
all
his
anger
i
told
you
to
keep
away
from
here
said
dry
valley
go
back
to
your
home
panchita
moved
slowly
toward
him
dry
valley
cracked
his
whip
go
back
home
said
dry
valley
savagely
and
play
theatricals
some
more
you
make
a
fine
man
you
made
a
fine
one
of
me
she
came
a
step
nearer
silent
and
with
that
strange
defiant
steady
shine
in
her
eyes
that
had
always
puzzled
him
now
it
stirred
his
wrath
his
whiplash
whistled
through
the
air
he
saw
a
red
streak
suddenly
come
out
through
her
white
dress
above
her
knee
where
it
had
struck
without
flinching
and
with
the
same
unchanging
dark
glow
in
her
eyes
panchita
came
steadily
toward
him
through
the
strawberry
vines
dry
valley
trembling
hand
released
his
whip
handle
when
within
a
yard
of
him
panchita
stretched
out
her
arms
god
kid
stammered
dry
valley
do
you
mean
but
the
seasons
are
versatile
and
it
may
have
been
springtime
after
all
instead
of
indian
summer
that
struck
dry
valley
johnson
xvii
christmas
by
injunction
cherokee
was
the
civic
father
of
yellowhammer
yellowhammer
was
a
new
mining
town
constructed
mainly
of
canvas
and
undressed
pine
cherokee
was
a
prospector
one
day
while
his
burro
was
eating
quartz
and
pine
burrs
cherokee
turned
up
with
his
pick
a
nugget
weighing
thirty
ounces
he
staked
his
claim
and
then
being
a
man
of
breadth
and
hospitality
sent
out
invitations
to
his
friends
in
three
states
to
drop
in
and
share
his
luck
not
one
of
the
invited
guests
sent
regrets
they
rolled
in
from
the
gila
country
from
salt
river
from
the
pecos
from
albuquerque
and
phoenix
and
santa
fe
and
from
the
camps
intervening
when
a
thousand
citizens
had
arrived
and
taken
up
claims
they
named
the
town
yellowhammer
appointed
a
vigilance
committee
and
presented
cherokee
with
a
made
of
nuggets
three
hours
after
the
presentation
ceremonies
cherokee
claim
played
out
he
had
located
a
pocket
instead
of
a
vein
he
abandoned
it
and
staked
others
one
by
one
luck
had
kissed
her
hand
to
him
never
afterward
did
he
turn
up
enough
dust
in
yellowhammer
to
pay
his
bar
bill
but
his
thousand
invited
guests
were
mostly
prospering
and
cherokee
smiled
and
congratulated
them
yellowhammer
was
made
up
of
men
who
took
off
their
hats
to
a
smiling
loser
so
they
invited
cherokee
to
say
what
he
wanted
me
said
cherokee
oh
grubstakes
will
be
about
the
thing
i
reckon
i
prospect
along
up
in
the
mariposas
if
i
strike
it
up
there
i
will
most
certainly
let
you
all
know
about
the
facts
i
never
was
any
hand
to
hold
out
cards
on
my
friends
in
may
cherokee
packed
his
burro
and
turned
its
thoughtful
coloured
forehead
to
the
north
many
citizens
escorted
him
to
the
undefined
limits
of
yellowhammer
and
bestowed
upon
him
shouts
of
commendation
and
farewells
five
pocket
flasks
without
an
air
bubble
between
contents
and
cork
were
forced
upon
him
and
he
was
bidden
to
consider
yellowhammer
in
perpetual
commission
for
his
bed
bacon
and
eggs
and
hot
water
for
shaving
in
the
event
that
luck
did
not
see
fit
to
warm
her
hands
by
his
campfire
in
the
mariposas
the
name
of
the
father
of
yellowhammer
was
given
him
by
the
gold
hunters
in
accordance
with
their
popular
system
of
nomenclature
it
was
not
necessary
for
a
citizen
to
exhibit
his
baptismal
certificate
in
order
to
acquire
a
cognomen
a
man
name
was
his
personal
property
for
convenience
in
calling
him
up
to
the
bar
and
in
designating
him
among
other
bipeds
a
temporary
appellation
title
or
epithet
was
conferred
upon
him
by
the
public
personal
peculiarities
formed
the
source
of
the
majority
of
such
informal
baptisms
many
were
easily
dubbed
geographically
from
the
regions
from
which
they
confessed
to
have
hailed
some
announced
themselves
to
be
thompsons
and
adamses
and
the
like
with
a
brazenness
and
loudness
that
cast
a
cloud
upon
their
titles
a
few
vaingloriously
and
shamelessly
uncovered
their
proper
and
indisputable
names
this
was
held
to
be
unduly
arrogant
and
did
not
win
popularity
one
man
who
said
he
was
chesterton
belmont
and
proved
it
by
letters
was
given
till
sundown
to
leave
the
town
such
names
as
shorty
texas
lazy
bill
thirsty
rogers
limping
riley
the
judge
and
california
ed
were
in
favour
cherokee
derived
his
title
from
the
fact
that
he
claimed
to
have
lived
for
a
time
with
that
tribe
in
the
indian
nation
on
the
twentieth
day
of
december
baldy
the
mail
rider
brought
yellowhammer
a
piece
of
news
what
do
i
see
in
albuquerque
said
baldy
to
the
patrons
of
the
bar
but
cherokee
all
embellished
and
festooned
up
like
the
czar
of
turkey
and
lavishin
money
in
bulk
him
and
me
seen
the
elephant
and
the
owl
and
we
had
specimens
of
this
seidlitz
powder
wine
and
cherokee
he
audits
all
the
bills
his
pockets
looked
like
a
pool
table
after
a
run
cherokee
must
have
struck
pay
ore
remarked
california
ed
well
he
white
i
much
obliged
to
him
for
his
success
seems
like
cherokee
would
ramble
down
to
yellowhammer
and
see
his
friends
said
another
slightly
aggrieved
but
that
the
way
prosperity
is
the
finest
cure
there
is
for
lost
forgetfulness
you
wait
said
baldy
i
comin
to
that
cherokee
strikes
a
foot
vein
up
in
the
mariposas
that
assays
a
trip
to
europe
to
the
ton
and
he
closes
it
out
to
a
syndicate
outfit
for
a
hundred
thousand
hasty
dollars
in
cash
then
he
buys
himself
a
baby
sealskin
overcoat
and
a
red
sleigh
and
what
do

he
takes
it
in
his

hatteras
two
minutes
of
absolute
silence
ticked
away
in
the
wake
of
words
it
was
broken
by
the
house
who
happily
conceiving
the
moment
to
be
ripe
for
extending
hospitality
sent
a
dozen
whisky
glasses
spinning
down
the
bar
with
the
slower
travelling
bottle
bringing
up
the
rear
did
you
tell
him
asked
the
miner
called
trinidad
well
no

baldy
pensively
i
never
exactly
seen
my
way
to
you
see
cherokee
had
this
christmas
mess
already
bought
and
paid
for
and
he
was
all
flattered
up
with
over
his
idea
and
we
had
in
a
way
flew
the
flume
with
that
fizzy
wine
i
speak
of
so
i
never
let
on
i
can
not
refrain
from
a
certain
amount
of
surprise
said
the
judge
as
he
hung
his
cane
on
the
bar
that
our
friend
cherokee
should
possess
such
an
erroneous
conception
of
ah
his
as
it
were
own
town
oh
it
ai
the
eighth
wonder
of
the
terrestrial
world
said
baldy
cherokee
been
gone
from
yellowhammer
over
seven
months
lots
of
things
could
happen
in
that
time
how
he
to
know
that
there
ai
a
single
kid
in
this
town
and
so
far
as
emigration
is
concerned
none
expected
come
to
think
of
it
remarked
california
ed
it
funny
some
drifted
in
town
ai
settled
enough
yet
for
to
bring
in
the
ring
brigade
i
reckon
to
top
off
this
splurge
of
cherokee
went
on
baldy
he
goin
to
give
an
imitation
of
santa
claus
he
got
a
white
wig
and
whiskers
that
disfigure
him
up
exactly
like
the
pictures
of
this
william
cullen
longfellow
in
the
books
and
a
red
suit
of
outside
underwear
and
gloves
and
a
croshayed
red
cap
ai
it
a
shame
that
a
outfit
like
that
ca
get
a
chance
to
connect
with
a
annie
and
willie
prayer
layout
when
does
cherokee
allow
to
come
over
with
his
truck
inquired
trinidad
mornin
before
christmas
said
baldy
and
he
wants
you
folks
to
have
a
room
fixed
up
and
a
tree
hauled
and
ready
and
such
ladies
to
assist
as
can
stop
breathin
long
enough
to
let
it
be
a
surprise
for
the
kids
the
unblessed
condition
of
yellowhammer
had
been
truly
described
the
voice
of
childhood
had
never
gladdened
its
flimsy
structures
the
patter
of
restless
little
feet
had
never
consecrated
the
one
rugged
highway
between
the
two
rows
of
tents
and
rough
buildings
later
they
would
come
but
now
yellowhammer
was
but
a
mountain
camp
and
nowhere
in
it
were
the
roguish
expectant
eyes
opening
wide
at
dawn
of
the
enchanting
day
the
eager
small
hands
to
reach
for
bewildering
hoard
the
elated
childish
voicings
of
the
season
joy
such
as
the
coming
good
things
of
the
cherokee
deserved
of
women
there
were
five
in
yellowhammer
the
assayer
wife
the
proprietress
of
the
lucky
strike
hotel
and
a
laundress
whose
washtub
panned
out
an
ounce
of
dust
a
day
these
were
the
permanent
feminines
the
remaining
two
were
the
spangler
sisters
misses
fanchon
and
erma
of
the
transcontinental
comedy
company
then
playing
in
repertoire
at
the
improvised
empire
theatre
but
of
children
there
were
none
sometimes
miss
fanchon
enacted
with
spirit
and
address
the
part
of
robustious
childhood
but
between
her
delineation
and
the
visions
of
adolescence
that
the
fancy
offered
as
eligible
recipients
of
cherokee
holiday
stores
there
seemed
to
be
fixed
a
gulf
christmas
would
come
on
thursday
on
tuesday
morning
trinidad
instead
of
going
to
work
sought
the
judge
at
the
lucky
strike
hotel
it
be
a
disgrace
to
yellowhammer
said
trinidad
if
it
throws
cherokee
down
on
his
christmas
tree
blowout
you
might
say
that
that
man
made
this
town
for
one
i
goin
to
see
what
can
be
done
to
give
santa
claus
a
square
deal
my
said
the
judge
would
be
gladly
forthcoming
i
am
indebted
to
cherokee
for
past
favours
but
i
do
not
see
i
have
heretofore
regarded
the
absence
of
children
rather
as
a
luxury
but
in
this
instance
still
i
do
not
see
look
at
me
said
trinidad
and
you
see
old
ways
and
means
with
the
fur
on
i
goin
to
hitch
up
a
team
and
rustle
a
load
of
kids
for
cherokee
santa
claus
act
if
i
have
to
rob
an
orphan
asylum
eureka
cried
the
judge
enthusiastically
no
you
did
said
trinidad
decidedly
i
found
it
myself
i
learned
about
that
latin
word
at
school
i
will
accompany
you
declared
the
judge
waving
his
cane
perhaps
such
eloquence
and
gift
of
language
as
i
possess
will
be
of
benefit
in
persuading
our
young
friends
to
lend
themselves
to
our
project
within
an
hour
yellowhammer
was
acquainted
with
the
scheme
of
trinidad
and
the
judge
and
approved
it
citizens
who
knew
of
families
with
offspring
within
a
radius
of
yellowhammer
came
forward
and
contributed
their
information
trinidad
made
careful
notes
of
all
such
and
then
hastened
to
secure
a
vehicle
and
team
the
first
stop
scheduled
was
at
a
double
fifteen
miles
out
from
yellowhammer
a
man
opened
the
door
at
trinidad
hail
and
then
came
down
and
leaned
upon
the
rickety
gate
the
doorway
was
filled
with
a
close
mass
of
youngsters
some
ragged
all
full
of
curiosity
and
health
it
this
way
explained
trinidad
we
from
yellowhammer
and
we
come
kidnappin
in
a
gentle
kind
of
a
way
one
of
our
leading
citizens
is
stung
with
the
santa
claus
affliction
and
he
due
in
town
with
half
the
folderols
that
painted
red
and
made
in
germany
the
youngest
kid
we
got
in
yellowhammer
packs
a
and
a
safety
razor
consequently
we
mighty
shy
on
anybody
to
say
and
when
we
light
the
candles
on
the
christmas
tree
now
partner
if
you
loan
us
a
few
kids
we
guarantee
to
return
safe
and
sound
on
christmas
day
and
they
come
back
loaded
down
with
a
good
time
and
swiss
family
robinsons
and
cornucopias
and
red
drums
and
similar
testimonials
what
do
you
say
in
other
words
said
the
judge
we
have
discovered
for
the
first
time
in
our
embryonic
but
progressive
little
city
the
inconveniences
of
the
absence
of
adolescence
the
season
of
the
year
having
approximately
arrived
during
which
it
is
a
custom
to
bestow
frivolous
but
often
appreciated
gifts
upon
the
young
and
tender
i
understand
said
the
parent
packing
his
pipe
with
a
forefinger
i
guess
i
need
detain
you
gentlemen
me
and
the
old
woman
have
got
seven
kids
so
to
speak
and
runnin
my
mind
over
the
bunch
i
appear
to
hit
upon
none
that
we
could
spare
for
you
to
take
over
to
your
doin
the
old
woman
has
got
some
popcorn
candy
and
rag
dolls
hid
in
the
clothes
chest
and
we
allow
to
give
christmas
a
little
whirl
of
our
own
in
a
insignificant
sort
of
style
no
i
could
with
any
degree
of
avidity
seem
to
fall
in
with
the
idea
of
none
of
go
thank
you
kindly
gentlemen
down
the
slope
they
drove
and
up
another
foothill
to
the
of
wiley
wilson
trinidad
recited
his
appeal
and
the
judge
boomed
out
his
ponderous
antiphony
wiley
gathered
her
two
youngsters
close
to
her
skirts
and
did
not
smile
until
she
had
seen
wiley
laugh
and
shake
his
head
again
a
refusal
trinidad
and
the
judge
vainly
exhausted
more
than
half
their
list
before
twilight
set
in
among
the
hills
they
spent
the
night
at
a
stage
road
hostelry
and
set
out
again
early
the
next
morning
the
wagon
had
not
acquired
a
single
passenger
it
creepin
upon
my
faculties
remarked
trinidad
that
kids
at
christmas
is
somethin
like
tryin
to
steal
butter
from
a
man
that
got
hot
pancakes
it
is
undoubtedly
an
indisputable
fact
said
the
judge
that
the
ah
family
ties
seem
to
be
more
coherent
and
assertive
at
that
period
of
the
year
on
the
day
before
christmas
they
drove
thirty
miles
making
four
fruitless
halts
and
appeals
everywhere
they
found
kids
at
a
premium
the
sun
was
low
when
the
wife
of
a
section
boss
on
a
lonely
railroad
huddled
her
unavailable
progeny
behind
her
and
said
there
a
woman
that
just
took
charge
of
the
railroad
eatin
house
down
at
granite
junction
i
hear
she
got
a
little
boy
maybe
she
might
let
him
go
trinidad
pulled
up
his
mules
at
granite
junction
at
five
in
the
afternoon
the
train
had
just
departed
with
its
load
of
fed
and
appeased
passengers
on
the
steps
of
the
eating
house
they
found
a
thin
and
glowering
boy
of
ten
smoking
a
cigarette
the
had
been
left
in
chaos
by
the
peripatetic
appetites
a
youngish
woman
reclined
exhausted
in
a
chair
her
face
wore
sharp
lines
of
worry
she
had
once
possessed
a
certain
style
of
beauty
that
would
never
wholly
leave
her
and
would
never
wholly
return
trinidad
set
forth
his
mission
i
count
it
a
mercy
if
you
take
bobby
for
a
while
she
said
wearily
i
on
the
go
from
morning
till
night
and
i
do
have
time
to
to
him
he
learning
bad
habits
from
the
men
it
be
the
only
chance
he
have
to
get
any
christmas
the
men
went
outside
and
conferred
with
bobby
trinidad
pictured
the
glories
of
the
christmas
tree
and
presents
in
lively
colours
and
moreover
my
young
friend
added
the
judge
santa
claus
himself
will
personally
distribute
the
offerings
that
will
typify
the
gifts
conveyed
by
the
shepherds
of
bethlehem
to
aw
come
off
said
the
boy
squinting
his
small
eyes
i
ai
no
kid
there
ai
any
santa
claus
it
your
folks
that
buys
toys
and
sneaks
in
when
you
asleep
and
they
make
marks
in
the
soot
in
the
chimney
with
the
tongs
to
look
like
santa
sleigh
tracks
that
might
be
so
argued
trinidad
but
christmas
trees
ai
no
fairy
tale
this
one
goin
to
look
like
the
store
in
albuquerque
all
strung
up
in
a
redwood
there
tops
and
drums
and
noah
arks
and
oh
rats
said
bobby
wearily
i
cut
them
out
long
ago
i
like
to
have
a
rifle
not
a
target
one
a
real
one
to
shoot
wildcats
with
but
i
guess
you
wo
have
any
of
them
on
your
old
tree
well
i
ca
say
for
sure
said
trinidad
diplomatically
it
might
be
you
go
along
with
us
and
see
the
hope
thus
held
out
though
faint
won
the
boy
hesitating
consent
to
go
with
this
solitary
beneficiary
for
cherokee
holiday
bounty
the
canvassers
spun
along
the
homeward
road
in
yellowhammer
the
empty
storeroom
had
been
transformed
into
what
might
have
passed
as
the
bower
of
an
arizona
fairy
the
ladies
had
done
their
work
well
a
tall
christmas
tree
covered
to
the
topmost
branch
with
candles
spangles
and
toys
sufficient
for
more
than
a
score
of
children
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
near
sunset
anxious
eyes
had
begun
to
scan
the
street
for
the
returning
team
of
the
at
noon
that
day
cherokee
had
dashed
into
town
with
his
new
sleigh
piled
high
with
bundles
and
boxes
and
bales
of
all
sizes
and
shapes
so
intent
was
he
upon
the
arrangements
for
his
altruistic
plans
that
the
dearth
of
children
did
not
receive
his
notice
no
one
gave
away
the
humiliating
state
of
yellowhammer
for
the
efforts
of
trinidad
and
the
judge
were
expected
to
supply
the
deficiency
when
the
sun
went
down
cherokee
with
many
wings
and
arch
grins
on
his
seasoned
face
went
into
retirement
with
the
bundle
containing
the
santa
claus
raiment
and
a
pack
containing
special
and
undisclosed
gifts
when
the
kids
are
rounded
up
he
instructed
the
volunteer
arrangement
committee
light
up
the
candles
on
the
tree
and
set
to
playin
wants
a
corner
and
william
when
they
get
good
and
at
it
why
old
santa
slide
in
the
door
i
reckon
be
plenty
of
gifts
to
go
the
ladies
were
flitting
about
the
tree
giving
it
final
touches
that
were
never
final
the
spangled
sisters
were
there
in
costume
as
lady
violet
de
vere
and
marie
the
maid
in
their
new
drama
the
bride
the
theatre
did
not
open
until
nine
and
they
were
welcome
assistants
of
the
christmas
tree
committee
every
minute
heads
would
pop
out
the
door
to
look
and
listen
for
the
approach
of
team
and
now
this
became
an
anxious
function
for
night
had
fallen
and
it
would
soon
be
necessary
to
light
the
candles
on
the
tree
and
cherokee
was
apt
to
make
an
irruption
at
any
time
in
his
kriss
kringle
garb
at
length
the
wagon
of
the
child
rustlers
rattled
down
the
street
to
the
door
the
ladies
with
little
screams
of
excitement
flew
to
the
lighting
of
the
candles
the
men
of
yellowhammer
passed
in
and
out
restlessly
or
stood
about
the
room
in
embarrassed
groups
trinidad
and
the
judge
bearing
the
marks
of
protracted
travel
entered
conducting
between
them
a
single
impish
boy
who
stared
with
sullen
pessimistic
eyes
at
the
gaudy
tree
where
are
the
other
children
asked
the
assayer
wife
the
acknowledged
leader
of
all
social
functions
said
trinidad
with
a
sigh
prospectin
for
kids
at
christmas
time
is
like
huntin
in
a
limestone
for
silver
this
parental
business
is
one
that
i
have
no
chance
to
comprehend
it
seems
that
fathers
and
mothers
are
willin
for
their
offsprings
to
be
drownded
stole
fed
on
poison
oak
and
et
by
catamounts
days
in
the
year
but
on
christmas
day
they
insists
on
enjoyin
the
exclusive
mortification
of
their
company
this
here
young
biped
is
all
that
washes
out
of
our
two
days
manoeuvres
oh
the
sweet
little
boy
cooed
miss
erma
trailing
her
de
vere
robes
to
centre
of
stage
aw
shut
up
said
bobby
with
a
scowl
who
a
kid
you
ai
you
bet
fresh
brat
breathed
miss
erma
beneath
her
enamelled
smile
we
done
the
best
we
could
said
trinidad
it
tough
on
cherokee
but
it
ca
be
helped
then
the
door
opened
and
cherokee
entered
in
the
conventional
dress
of
saint
nick
a
white
rippling
beard
and
flowing
hair
covered
his
face
almost
to
his
dark
and
shining
eyes
over
his
shoulder
he
carried
a
pack
no
one
stirred
as
he
came
in
even
the
spangler
sisters
ceased
their
coquettish
poses
and
stared
curiously
at
the
tall
figure
bobby
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
gazing
gloomily
at
the
effeminate
and
childish
tree
cherokee
put
down
his
pack
and
looked
wonderingly
about
the
room
perhaps
he
fancied
that
a
bevy
of
eager
children
were
being
herded
somewhere
to
be
loosed
upon
his
entrance
he
went
up
to
bobby
and
extended
his
hand
merry
christmas
little
boy
said
cherokee
anything
on
the
tree
you
want
they
get
it
down
for
you
wo
you
shake
hands
with
santa
claus
there
ai
any
santa
claus
whined
the
boy
you
got
old
false
billy
goat
whiskers
on
your
face
i
ai
no
kid
what
do
i
want
with
dolls
and
tin
horses
the
driver
said
you
have
a
rifle
and
you
have
i
want
to
go
home
trinidad
stepped
into
the
breach
he
shook
cherokee
hand
in
warm
greeting
i
sorry
cherokee
he
explained
there
never
was
a
kid
in
yellowhammer
we
tried
to
rustle
a
bunch
of
for
your
swaree
but
this
sardine
was
all
we
could
catch
he
a
atheist
and
he
believe
in
santa
claus
it
a
shame
for
you
to
be
out
all
this
truck
but
me
and
the
judge
was
sure
we
could
round
up
a
wagonful
of
candidates
for
your
gimcracks
that
all
right
said
cherokee
gravely
the
expense
do
amount
to
nothin
worth
mentionin
we
can
dump
the
stuff
down
a
shaft
or
throw
it
away
i
do
know
what
i
was
thinkin
about
but
it
never
occurred
to
my
cogitations
that
there
was
any
kids
in
yellowhammer
meanwhile
the
company
had
relaxed
into
a
hollow
but
praiseworthy
imitation
of
a
pleasure
gathering
bobby
had
retreated
to
a
distant
chair
and
was
coldly
regarding
the
scene
with
ennui
plastered
thick
upon
him
cherokee
lingering
with
his
original
idea
went
over
and
sat
beside
him
where
do
you
live
little
boy
he
asked
respectfully
granite
junction
said
bobby
without
emphasis
the
room
was
warm
cherokee
took
off
his
cap
and
then
removed
his
beard
and
wig
say
exclaimed
bobby
with
a
show
of
interest
i
know
your
mug
all
right
did
you
ever
see
me
before
asked
cherokee
i
do
know
but
i
seen
your
picture
lots
of
times
where
the
boy
hesitated
on
the
bureau
at
home
he
answered
let
have
your
name
if
you
please
buddy
robert
lumsden
the
picture
belongs
to
my
mother
she
puts
it
under
her
pillow
of
nights
and
once
i
saw
her
kiss
it
i
would
but
women
are
that
way
cherokee
rose
and
beckoned
to
trinidad
keep
this
boy
by
you
till
i
come
back
he
said
i
goin
to
shed
these
christmas
duds
and
hitch
up
my
sleigh
i
goin
to
take
this
kid
home
well
infidel
said
trinidad
taking
cherokee
vacant
chair
and
so
you
are
too
superannuated
and
effete
to
yearn
for
such
mockeries
as
candy
and
toys
it
seems
i
do
like
you
said
bobby
with
acrimony
you
said
there
would
be
a
rifle
a
fellow
ca
even
smoke
i
wish
i
was
at
home
cherokee
drove
his
sleigh
to
the
door
and
they
lifted
bobby
in
beside
him
the
team
of
fine
horses
sprang
away
prancingly
over
the
hard
snow
cherokee
had
on
his
overcoat
of
baby
sealskin
the
laprobe
that
he
drew
about
them
was
as
warm
as
velvet
bobby
slipped
a
cigarette
from
his
pocket
and
was
trying
to
snap
a
match
throw
that
cigarette
away
said
cherokee
in
a
quiet
but
new
voice
bobby
hesitated
and
then
dropped
the
cylinder
overboard
throw
the
box
too
commanded
the
new
voice
more
reluctantly
the
boy
obeyed
say
said
bobby
presently
i
like
you
i
do
know
why
nobody
never
made
me
do
anything
i
did
want
to
do
before
tell
me
kid
said
cherokee
not
using
his
new
voice
are
you
sure
your
mother
kissed
that
picture
that
looks
like
me
dead
sure
i
seen
her

it
did
you
remark
somethin
a
while
ago
about
wanting
a
rifle

bet
i
did
will

cherokee
took
out
his
watch
nine
we
hit
the
junction
plumb
on
time
with
christmas
day
are
you

drudging
toil
of
the
day
was
ended
lena
climbed
to
her
room
in
the
third
of
the
quarrymen
hotel
since
daylight
she
had
slaved
doing
the
work
of
a
woman
scrubbing
the
floors
washing
the
heavy
ironstone
plates
and
cups
making
the
beds
and
supplying
the
insatiate
demands
for
wood
and
water
in
that
turbulent
and
depressing
hostelry
the
din
of
the
day
quarrying
was
over
the
blasting
and
drilling
the
creaking
of
the
great
cranes
the
shouts
of
the
foremen
the
backing
and
shifting
of
the
hauling
the
heavy
blocks
of
limestone
down
in
the
hotel
office
three
or
four
of
the
labourers
were
growling
and
swearing
over
a
belated
game
of
checkers
heavy
odours
of
stewed
meat
hot
grease
and
cheap
coffee
hung
like
a
depressing
fog
about
the
house
lena
lit
the
stump
of
a
candle
and
sat
limply
upon
her
wooden
chair
she
was
eleven
years
old
thin
and
her
back
and
limbs
were
sore
and
aching
but
the
ache
in
her
heart
made
the
biggest
trouble
the
last
straw
had
been
added
to
the
burden
upon
her
small
shoulders
they
had
taken
away
grimm
always
at
night
however
tired
she
might
be
she
had
turned
to
grimm
for
comfort
and
hope
each
time
had
grimm
whispered
to
her
that
the
prince
or
the
fairy
would
come
and
deliver
her
out
of
the
wicked
enchantment
every
night
she
had
taken
fresh
courage
and
strength
from
grimm
to
whatever
tale
she
read
she
found
an
analogy
in
her
own
condition
the
woodcutter
lost
child
the
unhappy
goose
girl
the
persecuted
stepdaughter
the
little
maiden
imprisoned
in
the
witch
hut
all
these
were
but
transparent
disguises
for
lena
the
overworked
kitchenmaid
in
the
quarrymen
hotel
and
always
when
the
extremity
was
direst
came
the
good
fairy
or
the
gallant
prince
to
the
rescue
so
here
in
the
ogre
castle
enslaved
by
a
wicked
spell
lena
had
leaned
upon
grimm
and
waited
longing
for
the
powers
of
goodness
to
prevail
but
on
the
day
before
maloney
had
found
the
book
in
her
room
and
had
carried
it
away
declaring
sharply
that
it
would
not
do
for
servants
to
read
at
night
they
lost
sleep
and
did
not
work
briskly
the
next
day
can
one
only
eleven
years
old
living
away
from
one
mamma
and
never
having
any
time
to
play
live
entirely
deprived
of
grimm
just
try
it
once
and
you
will
see
what
a
difficult
thing
it
is
lena
home
was
in
texas
away
up
among
the
little
mountains
on
the
pedernales
river
in
a
little
town
called
fredericksburg
they
are
all
german
people
who
live
in
fredericksburg
of
evenings
they
sit
at
little
tables
along
the
sidewalk
and
drink
beer
and
play
pinochle
and
scat
they
are
very
thrifty
people
thriftiest
among
them
was
peter
hildesmuller
lena
father
and
that
is
why
lena
was
sent
to
work
in
the
hotel
at
the
quarries
thirty
miles
away
she
earned
three
dollars
every
week
there
and
peter
added
her
wages
to
his
store
peter
had
an
ambition
to
become
as
rich
as
his
neighbour
hugo
heffelbauer
who
smoked
a
meerschaum
pipe
three
feet
long
and
had
wiener
schnitzel
and
hassenpfeffer
for
dinner
every
day
in
the
week
and
now
lena
was
quite
old
enough
to
work
and
assist
in
the
accumulation
of
riches
but
conjecture
if
you
can
what
it
means
to
be
sentenced
at
eleven
years
of
age
from
a
home
in
the
pleasant
little
rhine
village
to
hard
labour
in
the
castle
where
you
must
fly
to
serve
the
ogres
while
they
devour
cattle
and
sheep
growling
fiercely
as
they
stamp
white
limestone
dust
from
their
great
shoes
for
you
to
sweep
and
scour
with
your
weak
aching
fingers
and
then
to
have
grimm
taken
away
from
you
lena
raised
the
lid
of
an
old
empty
case
that
had
once
contained
canned
corn
and
got
out
a
sheet
of
paper
and
a
piece
of
pencil
she
was
going
to
write
a
letter
to
her
mamma
tommy
ryan
was
going
to
post
it
for
her
at
ballinger
tommy
was
seventeen
worked
in
the
quarries
went
home
to
ballinger
every
night
and
was
now
waiting
in
the
shadows
under
lena
window
for
her
to
throw
the
letter
out
to
him
that
was
the
only
way
she
could
send
a
letter
to
fredericksburg
maloney
did
not
like
for
her
to
write
letters
the
stump
of
the
candle
was
burning
low
so
lena
hastily
bit
the
wood
from
around
the
lead
of
her
pencil
and
began
this
is
the
letter
she
wrote
dearest
mamma

want
so
much
to
see
you

gretel
and
claus
and
heinrich

you

mamma
if
i
do
it
your
respectful
and
loving
daughter
lena
tommy
was
still
waiting
faithfully
when
the
letter
was
concluded
and
when
lena
dropped
it
out
she
saw
him
pick
it
up
and
start
up
the
steep
hillside
without
undressing
she
blew
out
the
candle
and
curled
herself
upon
the
mattress
on
the
floor
at
old
man
ballinger
came
out
of
his
house
in
his
stocking
feet
and
leaned
over
the
gate
smoking
his
pipe
he
looked
down
the
big
road
white
in
the
moonshine
and
rubbed
one
ankle
with
the
toe
of
his
other
foot
it
was
time
for
the
fredericksburg
mail
to
come
pattering
up
the
road
old
man
ballinger
had
waited
only
a
few
minutes
when
he
heard
the
lively
hoofbeats
of
fritz
team
of
little
black
mules
and
very
soon
afterward
his
covered
spring
wagon
stood
in
front
of
the
gate
big
spectacles
flashed
in
the
moonlight
and
his
tremendous
voice
shouted
a
greeting
to
the
postmaster
of
ballinger
the
jumped
out
and
took
the
bridles
from
the
mules
for
he
always
fed
them
oats
at
ballinger
while
the
mules
were
eating
from
their
feed
bags
old
man
ballinger
brought
out
the
mail
sack
and
threw
it
into
the
wagon
fritz
bergmann
was
a
man
of
three
sentiments
or
to
be
more
accurate
four
the
pair
of
mules
deserving
to
be
reckoned
individually
those
mules
were
the
chief
interest
and
joy
of
his
existence
next
came
the
emperor
of
germany
and
lena
hildesmuller
tell
me
said
fritz
when
he
was
ready
to
start
contains

sack

letter
to
frau
hildesmuller
from
the
little
lena
at
the
quarries
one
came
in
the
last
mail
to
say

little
sick

peter
hildesmuller
some
day
i

her
mamma

be
glad
herr

your

so
long
fritzy
said
old
man
ballinger
you
got
a
nice
cool
night
for
your
drive
up
the
road
went
the
little
black
mules
at
their
steady
trot
while
fritz
thundered
at
them
occasional
words
of
endearment
and
cheer
these
fancies
occupied
the
mind
of
the
until
he
reached
the
big
post
oak
forest
eight
miles
from
ballinger
here
his
ruminations
were
scattered
by
the
sudden
flash
and
report
of
pistols
and
a
whooping
as
if
from
a
whole
tribe
of
indians
a
band
of
galloping
centaurs
closed
in
around
the
mail
wagon
one
of
them
leaned
over
the
front
wheel
covered
the
driver
with
his
revolver
and
ordered
him
to
stop
others
caught
at
the
bridles
of
donder
and
blitzen
donnerwetter
shouted
fritz
with
all
his
tremendous
voice

drawled
a
melancholy
voice
do
you
know
when
you
in
a
reverse
your
mules
and
climb
out
of
the
cart
it
is
due
to
the
breadth
of
hondo
bill
demerit
and
the
largeness
of
his
achievements
to
state
that
the
holding
up
of
the
fredericksburg
mail
was
not
perpetrated
by
way
of
an
exploit
as
the
lion
while
in
the
pursuit
of
prey
commensurate
to
his
prowess
might
set
a
frivolous
foot
upon
a
casual
rabbit
in
his
path
so
hondo
bill
and
his
gang
had
swooped
sportively
upon
the
pacific
transport
of
meinherr
fritz
the
real
work
of
their
sinister
night
ride
was
over
fritz
and
his
mail
bag
and
his
mules
came
as
gentle
relaxation
grateful
after
the
arduous
duties
of
their
profession
twenty
miles
to
the
southeast
stood
a
train
with
a
killed
engine
hysterical
passengers
and
a
looted
express
and
mail
car
that
represented
the
serious
occupation
of
hondo
bill
and
his
gang
with
a
fairly
rich
prize
of
currency
and
silver
the
robbers
were
making
a
wide
detour
to
the
west
through
the
less
populous
country
intending
to
seek
safety
in
mexico
by
means
of
some
fordable
spot
on
the
rio
grande
the
booty
from
the
train
had
melted
the
desperate
bushrangers
to
jovial
and
happy
skylarkers
trembling
with
outraged
dignity
and
no
little
personal
apprehension
fritz
climbed
out
to
the
road
after
replacing
his
suddenly
removed
spectacles
the
band
had
dismounted
and
were
singing
capering
and
whooping
thus
expressing
their
satisfied
delight
in
the
life
of
a
jolly
outlaw

stood
at

too
vigorously
at

of

reared
and
emitted
a
loud
protesting
snort
of
pain
instantly
fritz
with
a
scream
of

flew
at

dragging
the

from

of

before
moody
had
finished
his
speech
a
knife
shone
in
his
hand
and
they
heard
the
ripping
sound
as
it
bit
through
the
tough
canvas
the
outlaws
crowded
around
and
began
tearing
open
letters
and
packages
enlivening
their
labours
by
swearing
affably
at

to
have

above

little
german
who
at
once
began
to
read
the

translating
the
simple
words

the

hondo

parleyed
aside
briefly
with
his
band
and
then
they
seized
fritz
and
conveyed
him
off
the

side

time
of
day
as
it
is
up
to
us
to
depart
ausgespielt
nixcumrous
dutchy
do
get
any
more
impatience
fritz
heard
a
great
squeaking
of
saddles
as
the
men
mounted
their
horses
then
a
loud
yell
and
a
great
clatter
of
hoofs
as
they
galloped
back
along
the
fredericksburg
road
for
more
than
two
hours
fritz
sat
against
his
tree
tightly
but
not
painfully
bound
then
from
the
reaction
after
his
exciting
adventure
he
sank
into
slumber
how
long
he
slept
he
knew
not
but
he
was
at
last
awakened
by
a
rough
shake
hands
were
untying
his
ropes
he
was
lifted
to
his
feet
dazed
confused
in
mind
and
weary
of
body
rubbing
his
eyes
he
looked
and
saw
that
he
was
again
in
the
midst
of
the
same
band
of
terrible
bandits
they
shoved
him
up
to
the
seat
of
his
wagon
and
placed
the
lines
in
his
hands
hit
it
out
for
home
dutch
said
hondo

voice
commandingly
you
given
us
lots
of
trouble
and
we
pleased
to
see
the

of
your
neck

hondo
reached
out
and
gave
blitzen
a
smart
cut
with
his
quirt
the
little
mules
sprang
ahead
glad
to
be
moving
again
fritz
urged
them
along
himself
dizzy
and
muddled
over
his
fearful
adventure
according
to
schedule
time
he
should
have
reached
fredericksburg
at
daylight
as
it
was
he
drove
down
the
long
street
of
the
town
at
eleven
he
had
to
pass
peter
hildesmuller
house
on
his
way
to
the
he
stopped
his
team
at
the
gate
and
called
but
frau
hildesmuller
was
watching
for
him
out
rushed
the
whole
family
of
hildesmullers
frau
hildesmuller
fat
and
flushed
inquired
if
he
had
a
letter
from
lena
and
then
fritz
raised
his
voice
and
told
the
tale
of
his
adventure
he
told
the
contents
of
that
letter
that
the
robber
had
made
him
read
and
then
frau
hildesmuller
broke
into
wild
weeping
her
little
lena
drown
herself
why
had
they
sent
her
from
home
what
could
be
done
perhaps
it
would
be
too
late
by
the
time
they
could
send
for
her
now
peter
hildesmuller
dropped
his
meerschaum
on
the
walk
and
it
shivered
into
pieces
woman
he
roared
at
his
wife
why
did
you
let
that
child
go
away
it
is
your
fault
if
she
comes
home
to
us
no
more
every
one
knew
that
it
was
peter
hildesmuller
fault
so
they
paid
no
attention
to
his
words
a
moment
afterward
a
strange
faint
voice
was
heard
to
call
mamma
frau
hildesmuller
at
first
thought
it
was
lena
spirit
calling
and
then
she
rushed
to
the
rear
of
fritz
covered
wagon
and
with
a
loud
shriek
of
joy
caught
up
lena
herself
covering
her
pale
little
face
with
kisses
and
smothering
her
with
hugs
lena
eyes
were
heavy
with
the
deep
slumber
of
exhaustion
but
she
smiled
and
lay
close
to
the
one
she
had
longed
to
see
there
among
the
mail
sacks
covered
in
a
nest
of
strange
blankets
and
comforters
she
had
lain
asleep
until
wakened
by
the
voices
around
her
fritz
stared
at
her
with
eyes
that
bulged
behind
his
spectacles
gott
in
himmel
he
shouted
how
did
you
get
in
that
wagon
am
i
going
crazy
as
well
as
to
be
murdered
and
hanged
by
robbers
this
day
you
brought
her
to
us
fritz
cried
frau
hildesmuller
how
can
we
ever
thank
you
enough

mamma
how
you
came
in
fritz
wagon
said
frau
hildesmuller
i
do
know
said
lena
but
i
know
how
i
got
away
from
the
hotel
the
prince
brought
me
by
the
emperor
crown
shouted
fritz
we
are
all
going
crazy
i
always
knew
he
would
come
said
lena
sitting
down
on
her
bundle
of
bedclothes
on
the
sidewalk
last
night
he
came
with
his
armed
knights
and
captured
the
ogre
castle
they
broke
the
dishes
and
kicked
down
the
doors
they
pitched
maloney
into
a
barrel
of
rain
water
and
threw
flour
all
over
maloney
the
workmen
in
the
hotel
jumped
out
of
the
windows
and
ran
into
the
woods
when
the
knights
began
firing
their
guns
they
wakened
me
up
and
i
peeped
down
the
stair
and
then
the
prince
came
up
and
wrapped
me
in
the
bedclothes
and
carried
me
out
he
was
so
tall
and
strong
and
fine
his
face
was
as
rough
as
a
scrubbing
brush
and
he
talked
soft
and
kind
and
smelled
of
schnapps
he
took
me
on
his
horse
before
him
and
we
rode
away
among
the
knights
he
held
me
close
and
i
went
to
sleep
that
way
and
wake
up
till
i
got
home
rubbish
cried
fritz
bergmann
fairy
tales
how
did
you
come
from
the
quarries
to
my
wagon
the
prince
brought
me
said
lena
confidently
and
to
this
day
the
good
people
of
fredericksburg
have
been
able
to
make
her
give
any
other
explanation
xix
the
reformation
of
calliope
calliope
catesby
was
in
his
humours
again
ennui
was
upon
him
this
goodly
promontory
the
earth
particularly
that
portion
of
it
known
as
quicksand
was
to
him
no
more
than
a
pestilent
congregation
of
vapours
overtaken
by
the
megrims
the
philosopher
may
seek
relief
in
soliloquy
my
lady
find
solace
in
tears
the
flaccid
easterner
scold
at
the
millinery
bills
of
his
women
folk
such
recourse
was
insufficient
to
the
denizens
of
quicksand
calliope
especially
was
wont
to
express
his
ennui
according
to
his
lights
over
night
calliope
had
hung
out
signals
of
approaching
low
spirits
he
had
kicked
his
own
dog
on
the
porch
of
the
occidental
hotel
and
refused
to
apologise
he
had
become
capricious
and
in
conversation
while
strolling
about
he
reached
often
for
twigs
of
mesquite
and
chewed
the
leaves
fiercely
that
was
always
an
ominous
act
another
symptom
alarming
to
those
who
were
familiar
with
the
different
stages
of
his
doldrums
was
his
increasing
politeness
and
a
tendency
to
use
formal
phrases
a
husky
softness
succeeded
the
usual
penetrating
drawl
in
his
tones
a
dangerous
courtesy
marked
his
manners
later
his
smile
became
crooked
the
left
side
of
his
mouth
slanting
upward
and
quicksand
got
ready
to
stand
from
under
at
this
stage
calliope
generally
began
to
drink
finally
about
midnight
he
was
seen
going
homeward
saluting
those
whom
he
met
with
exaggerated
but
inoffensive
courtesy
not
yet
was
melancholy
at
the
danger
point
he
would
seat
himself
at
the
window
of
the
room
he
occupied
over
silvester
tonsorial
parlours
and
there
chant
lugubrious
and
tuneless
ballads
until
morning
accompanying
the
noises
by
appropriate
maltreatment
of
a
jangling
guitar
more
magnanimous
than
nero
he
would
thus
give
musical
warning
of
the
forthcoming
municipal
upheaval
that
quicksand
was
scheduled
to
endure
a
quiet
amiable
man
was
calliope
catesby
at
other
times
quiet
to
indolence
and
amiable
to
worthlessness
at
best
he
was
a
loafer
and
a
nuisance
at
worst
he
was
the
terror
of
quicksand
his
ostensible
occupation
was
something
subordinate
in
the
real
estate
line
he
drove
the
beguiled
easterner
in
buckboards
out
to
look
over
lots
and
ranch
property
originally
he
came
from
one
of
the
gulf
states
his
lank
six
feet
slurring
rhythm
of
speech
and
sectional
idioms
giving
evidence
of
his
birthplace
and
yet
after
taking
on
western
adjustments
this
languid
whittler
cracker
barrel
hugger
shady
corner
lounger
of
the
cotton
fields
and
sumac
hills
of
the
south
became
famed
as
a
bad
man
among
men
who
had
made
a
study
of
the
art
of
truculence
at
nine
the
next
morning
calliope
was
fit
inspired
by
his
own
barbarous
melodies
and
the
contents
of
his
jug
he
was
ready
primed
to
gather
fresh
laurels
from
the
diffident
brow
of
quicksand
encircled
and
with
cartridge
belts
abundantly
garnished
with
revolvers
and
copiously
drunk
he
poured
forth
into
quicksand
main
street
too
chivalrous
to
surprise
and
capture
a
town
by
silent
sortie
he
paused
at
the
nearest
corner
and
emitted
his
slogan
that
fearful
brassy
yell
so
reminiscent
of
the
steam
piano
that
had
gained
for
him
the
classic
appellation
that
had
superseded
his
own
baptismal
name
following
close
upon
his
vociferation
came
three
shots
from
his
by
way
of
limbering
up
the
guns
and
testing
his
aim
a
yellow
dog
the
personal
property
of
colonel
swazey
the
proprietor
of
the
occidental
fell
feet
upward
in
the
dust
with
one
farewell
yelp
a
mexican
who
was
crossing
the
street
from
the
blue
front
grocery
carrying
in
his
hand
a
bottle
of
kerosene
was
stimulated
to
a
sudden
and
admirable
burst
of
speed
still
grasping
the
neck
of
the
shattered
bottle
the
new
gilt
on
judge
riley
lemon
and
ultramarine
residence
shivered
flapped
and
hung
by
a
splinter
the
sport
of
the
wanton
breezes
the
artillery
was
in
trim
calliope
hand
was
steady
the
high
calm
ecstasy
of
habitual
battle
was
upon
him
though
slightly
embittered
by
the
sadness
of
alexander
in
that
his
conquests
were
limited
to
the
small
world
of
quicksand
down
the
street
went
calliope
shooting
right
and
left
glass
fell
like
hail
dogs
vamosed
chickens
flew
squawking
feminine
voices
shrieked
concernedly
to
youngsters
at
large
the
din
was
perforated
at
intervals
by
the
of
the
terror
guns
and
was
drowned
periodically
by
the
brazen
screech
that
quicksand
knew
so
well
the
occasions
of
calliope
low
spirits
were
legal
holidays
in
quicksand
all
along
the
main
street
in
advance
of
his
coming
clerks
were
putting
up
shutters
and
closing
doors
business
would
languish
for
a
space
the
right
of
way
was
calliope
and
as
he
advanced
observing
the
dearth
of
opposition
and
the
few
opportunities
for
distraction
his
ennui
perceptibly
increased
but
some
four
squares
farther
down
lively
preparations
were
being
made
to
minister
to
catesby
love
for
interchange
of
compliments
and
repartee
on
the
previous
night
numerous
messengers
had
hastened
to
advise
buck
patterson
the
city
marshal
of
calliope
impending
eruption
the
patience
of
that
official
often
strained
in
extending
leniency
toward
the
disturber
misdeeds
had
been
overtaxed
in
quicksand
some
indulgence
was
accorded
the
natural
ebullition
of
human
nature
providing
that
the
lives
of
the
more
useful
citizens
were
not
recklessly
squandered
or
too
much
property
needlessly
laid
waste
the
community
sentiment
was
against
a
too
strict
enforcement
of
the
law
but
calliope
had
raised
the
limit
his
outbursts
had
been
too
frequent
and
too
violent
to
come
within
the
classification
of
a
normal
and
sanitary
relaxation
of
spirit
buck
patterson
had
been
expecting
and
awaiting
in
his
little
twelve
frame
office
that
preliminary
yell
announcing
that
calliope
was
feeling
blue
when
the
signal
came
the
city
marshal
rose
to
his
feet
and
buckled
on
his
guns
two
deputy
sheriffs
and
three
citizens
who
had
proven
the
edible
qualities
of
fire
also
stood
up
ready
to
bandy
with
calliope
leaden
jocularities
gather
that
fellow
in
said
buck
patterson
setting
forth
the
lines
of
the
campaign
do
have
no
talk
but
shoot
as
soon
as
you
can
get
a
show
keep
behind
cover
and
bring
him
down
he
a
nogood
up
to
calliope
to
turn
up
his
toes
this
time
i
reckon
go
to
him
all
spraddled
out
boys
and
do
git
too
reckless
for
what
calliope
shoots
at
he
hits
buck
patterson
tall
muscular
and
with
his
bright
city
marshal
badge
shining
on
the
breast
of
his
blue
flannel
shirt
gave
his
posse
directions
for
the
onslaught
upon
calliope
the
plan
was
to
accomplish
the
downfall
of
the
quicksand
terror
without
loss
to
the
attacking
party
if
possible
the
splenetic
calliope
unconscious
of
retributive
plots
was
steaming
down
the
channel
cannonading
on
either
side
when
he
suddenly
became
aware
of
breakers
ahead
the
city
marshal
and
one
of
the
deputies
rose
up
behind
some
boxes
half
a
square
to
the
front
and
opened
fire
at
the
same
time
the
rest
of
the
posse
divided
shelled
him
from
two
side
streets
up
which
they
were
cautiously
manoeuvring
from
a
detour
the
first
volley
broke
the
lock
of
one
of
calliope
guns
cut
a
neat
underbit
in
his
right
ear
and
exploded
a
cartridge
in
his
crossbelt
scorching
his
ribs
as
it
burst
feeling
braced
up
by
this
unexpected
tonic
to
his
spiritual
depression
calliope
executed
a
fortissimo
note
from
his
upper
register
and
returned
the
fire
like
an
echo
the
upholders
of
the
law
dodged
at
his
flash
but
a
trifle
too
late
to
save
one
of
the
deputies
a
bullet
just
above
the
elbow
and
the
marshal
a
bleeding
cheek
from
a
splinter
that
a
ball
tore
from
the
box
he
had
ducked
behind
and
now
calliope
met
the
enemy
tactics
in
kind
choosing
with
a
rapid
eye
the
street
from
which
the
weakest
and
least
accurate
fire
had
come
he
invaded
it
at
a
abandoning
the
unprotected
middle
of
the
street
with
rare
cunning
the
opposing
force
in
that
direction
one
of
the
deputies
and
two
of
the
valorous
volunteers
waited
concealed
by
beer
barrels
until
calliope
had
passed
their
retreat
and
then
peppered
him
from
the
rear
in
another
moment
they
were
reinforced
by
the
marshal
and
his
other
men
and
then
calliope
felt
that
in
order
to
successfully
prolong
the
delights
of
the
controversy
he
must
find
some
means
of
reducing
the
great
odds
against
him
his
eye
fell
upon
a
structure
that
seemed
to
hold
out
this
promise
providing
he
could
reach
it
not
far
away
was
the
little
railroad
station
its
building
a
strong
box
house
ten
by
twenty
feet
resting
upon
a
platform
four
feet
above
ground
windows
were
in
each
of
its
walls
something
like
a
fort
it
might
become
to
a
man
thus
sorely
pressed
by
superior
numbers
calliope
made
a
bold
and
rapid
spurt
for
it
the
marshal
crowd
smoking
him
as
he
ran
he
reached
the
haven
in
safety
the
station
agent
leaving
the
building
by
a
window
like
a
flying
squirrel
as
the
garrison
entered
the
door
patterson
and
his
supporters
halted
under
protection
of
a
pile
of
lumber
and
held
consultations
in
the
station
was
an
unterrified
desperado
who
was
an
excellent
shot
and
carried
an
abundance
of
ammunition
for
thirty
yards
on
either
side
of
the
besieged
was
a
stretch
of
bare
open
ground
it
was
a
sure
thing
that
the
man
who
attempted
to
enter
that
unprotected
area
would
be
stopped
by
one
of
calliope
bullets
the
city
marshal
was
resolved
he
had
decided
that
calliope
catesby
should
no
more
wake
the
echoes
of
quicksand
with
his
strident
whoop
he
had
so
announced
officially
and
personally
he
felt
imperatively
bound
to
put
the
soft
pedal
on
that
instrument
of
discord
it
played
bad
tunes
standing
near
was
a
hand
truck
used
in
the
manipulation
of
small
freight
it
stood
by
a
shed
full
of
sacked
wool
a
consignment
from
one
of
the
sheep
ranches
on
this
truck
the
marshal
and
his
men
piled
three
heavy
sacks
of
wool
stooping
low
buck
patterson
started
for
calliope
fort
slowly
pushing
this
loaded
truck
before
him
for
protection
the
posse
scattering
broadly
stood
ready
to
nip
the
besieged
in
case
he
should
show
himself
in
an
effort
to
repel
the
juggernaut
of
justice
that
was
creeping
upon
him
only
once
did
calliope
make
demonstration
he
fired
from
a
window
and
some
tufts
of
wool
spurted
from
the
marshal
trustworthy
bulwark
the
return
shots
from
the
posse
pattered
against
the
window
frame
of
the
fort
no
loss
resulted
on
either
side
the
marshal
was
too
deeply
engrossed
in
steering
his
protected
battleship
to
be
aware
of
the
approach
of
the
morning
train
until
he
was
within
a
few
feet
of
the
platform
the
train
was
coming
up
on
the
other
side
of
it
it
stopped
only
one
minute
at
quicksand
what
an
opportunity
it
would
offer
to
calliope
he
had
only
to
step
out
the
other
door
mount
the
train
and
away
abandoning
his
breastwork
buck
with
his
gun
ready
dashed
up
the
steps
and
into
the
room
driving
upon
the
closed
door
with
one
heave
of
his
weighty
shoulder
the
members
of
the
posse
heard
one
shot
fired
inside
and
then
there
was
silence
at
length
the
wounded
man
opened
his
eyes
after
a
blank
space
he
again
could
see
and
hear
and
feel
and
think
turning
his
eyes
about
he
found
himself
lying
on
a
wooden
bench
a
tall
man
with
a
perplexed
countenance
wearing
a
big
badge
with
city
marshal
engraved
upon
it
stood
over
him
a
little
old
woman
in
black
with
a
wrinkled
face
and
sparkling
black
eyes
was
holding
a
wet
handkerchief
against
one
of
his
temples
he
was
trying
to
get
these
facts
fixed
in
his
mind
and
connected
with
past
events
when
the
old
woman
began
to
talk
there
now
great
big
strong
man
that
bullet

tetched

and

surprisin
that

i

in
on

ai
he
lands

hardly

my
son
sir
half
turning
the
old
woman
looked
up
at
the
standing
man
her
worn
face
lighting
with
a
proud
and
wonderful
smile
she
reached
out
one
veined
and
calloused
hand
and
took
one
of
her
son
then
smiling
cheerily
down
at
the
prostrate
man
she
continued
to
dip
the
handkerchief
in
the
tin
washbasin
and
gently
apply
it
to
his
temple
she
had
the
benevolent
garrulity
of
old
age
i
ai
seen
my
son
before
she
continued
in
eight
years
one
of
my
nephews
elkanah
price
he

conductor
on
one
of
them
railroads
and
he
got
me
a
pass
to
come
out
here
i
can
stay
a
whole
week
on
it
and
then
it
take
me
back
again

think
now
that
little
boy
of
mine
has
got
to
be
a
officer
a
city
marshal
of
a
whole
town
somethin
like
a
constable
ai
it
i
never
knowed
he
was
a
officer
he
did
say
nothin
about
it
in
his
letters
i
reckon
he
thought
his
old
mother
be
skeered
about
the
danger
he
was
in
but
laws
i
never
was
much
of
a
hand
to
git
skeered
no
use
i
heard
them
guns
while
i
was
gettin
off
them
cars
and
i
see
smoke
out
of
the
depot
but
i
jest
walked
right
along
then
i
see
son
face
lookin
out
through
the
window
i
knowed
him
at
oncet
he
met
me
at
the
door
and
squeezes
me
to
death
and
there
you
was
sir
there
jest
like
you
was
dead
and
i
we
see
what
might
be
done
to
help
sot
you
up
i
think
i
sit
up
now
said
the
concussion
patient
i
feeling
pretty
fair
by
this
time
he
sat
somewhat
weakly
yet
leaning
against
the
wall
he
was
a
rugged
man
and
straight
his
eyes
steady
and
keen
seemed
to
linger
upon
the
face
of
the
man
standing
so
still
above
him
his
look
wandered
often
from
the
face
he
studied
to
the
marshal
badge
upon
the
other
breast
yes
yes
you
be
all
right
said
the
old
woman
patting
his
arm
if
you
do
get
to
cuttin
up
agin
and
havin
folks
shooting
at
you
son
told
me
about
you
sir
while
you
was
layin
senseless
on
the
floor
do
you
take
it
as
meddlesome
fer
an
old
woman
with
a
son
as
big
as
you
to
talk
about
it
and
you
must
hold
no
grudge
my
son
for
havin
to
shoot
at
ye
a
officer
has
got
to
take
up
for
the
law
it
his
duty
and
them
that
acts
bad
and
lives
wrong
has
to
suffer
do
blame
my
son
any
sir
his
fault
he
always
been
a
good
boy
good
when
he
was
growin
up
and
kind
and
and
wo
you
let
me
advise
you
sir
not
to
do
so
no
more
be
a
good
man
and
leave
liquor
alone
and
live
peaceably
and
goodly
keep
away
from
bad
company
and
work
honest
and
sleep
sweet
the
hand
of
the
old
pleader
gently
touched
the
breast
of
the
man
she
addressed
very
earnest
and
candid
her
old
worn
face
looked
in
her
rusty
black
dress
and
antique
bonnet
she
sat
near
the
close
of
a
long
life
and
epitomised
the
experience
of
the
world
still
the
man
to
whom
she
spoke
gazed
above
her
head
contemplating
the
silent
son
of
the
old
mother
what
does
the
marshal
say
he
asked
does
he
believe
the
advice
is
good
suppose
the
marshal
speaks
up
and
says
if
the
talk
all
right
the
tall
man
moved
uneasily
he
fingered
the
badge
on
his
breast
for
a
moment
and
then
he
put
an
arm
around
the
old
woman
and
drew
her
close
to
him
she
smiled
the
unchanging
mother
smile
of
years
and
patted
his
big
brown
hand
with
her
crooked
mittened
fingers
while
her
son
spake
i
says
this
he
said
looking
squarely
into
the
eyes
of
the
other
man
that
if
i
was
in
your
place
i
follow
it
if
i
was
a
drunken
character
without
shame
or
hope

your
place
