some
experiences
of
an
irish
i
mccarthy
a
resident
magistracy
in
ireland
is
not
an
easy
thing
to
come
by
nowadays
neither
is
it
a
very
attractive
job
yet
on
the
evening
when
i
first
propounded
the
idea
to
the
young
lady
who
had
recently
consented
to
become
sinclair
yeates
it
seemed
glittering
with
possibilities
there
was
on
that
occasion
a
sunset
and
a
string
band
playing
the
gondoliers
and
there
was
also
an
ingenuous
belief
in
the
omnipotence
of
a
godfather
of
philippa
philippa
was
the
young
lady
who
had
once
been
a
member
of
the
government
i
was
then
climbing
the
steep
ascent
of
the
captains
towards
my
majority
i
have
no
fault
to
find
with
philippa
godfather
he
did
all
and
more
than
even
philippa
had
expected
nevertheless
i
had
attained
to
the
dignity
of
mud
major
and
had
spent
a
good
deal
on
postage
stamps
and
on
railway
fares
to
interview
people
of
influence
before
i
found
myself
in
the
hotel
at
skebawn
opening
long
envelopes
addressed
to
major
yeates
my
most
immediate
concern
as
any
one
who
has
spent
nine
weeks
at
raverty
hotel
will
readily
believe
was
to
leave
it
at
the
earliest
opportunity
but
in
those
nine
weeks
i
had
learned
amongst
other
painful
things
a
little
a
very
little
of
the
methods
of
the
artisan
in
the
west
of
ireland
finding
a
house
had
been
easy
enough
i
had
had
my
choice
of
several
each
with
some
hundreds
of
acres
of
shooting
thoroughly
poached
and
a
considerable
portion
of
the
roof
intact
i
had
selected
one
the
one
that
had
the
largest
extent
of
roof
in
proportion
to
the
shooting
and
had
been
assured
by
my
landlord
that
in
a
fortnight
or
so
it
would
be
fit
for
occupation
there
a
few
little
odd
things
to
be
done
he
said
easily
a
lick
of
paint
here
and
there
and
a
slap
of
plaster
i
am
i
am
also
of
irish
extraction
both
facts
that
make
for
toleration
but
even
i
thought
he
was
understating
the
case
so
did
the
contractor
at
the
end
of
three
weeks
the
latter
reported
progress
which
mainly
consisted
of
the
facts
that
the
plumber
had
accused
the
carpenter
of
stealing
sixteen
feet
of
his
to
run
a
bell
wire
through
and
that
the
carpenter
had
replied
that
he
wished
the
divil
might
run
the
plumber
through
a
wran
quill
the
plumber
having
reflected
upon
the
carpenter
parentage
the
work
of
renovation
had
merged
in
battle
and
at
the
next
petty
sessions
i
was
reluctantly
compelled
to
allot
to
each
combatant
seven
days
without
the
option
of
a
fine
these
and
kindred
difficulties
extended
in
an
unbroken
chain
through
the
summer
months
until
a
certain
wet
and
windy
day
in
october
when
with
my
baggage
i
drove
over
to
establish
myself
at
shreelane
it
was
a
tall
ugly
house
of
three
storeys
high
its
walls
faced
with
slates
its
windows
staring
narrow
and
vacant
round
the
house
ran
an
area
in
which
grew
some
laurustinus
and
holly
bushes
among
ash
heaps
and
nettles
and
broken
bottles
i
stood
on
the
steps
waiting
for
the
door
to
be
opened
while
the
rain
sluiced
upon
me
from
a
broken
eaveshoot
that
had
amongst
many
other
things
escaped
the
notice
of
my
landlord
i
thought
of
philippa
and
of
her
plan
broached
in
letter
of
having
the
hall
done
up
as
a
the
door
opened
and
revealed
the
hall
it
struck
me
that
i
had
perhaps
overestimated
its
possibilities
among
them
i
had
certainly
not
included
a
flagged
floor
sweating
with
damp
and
a
reek
of
cabbage
from
the
adjacent
kitchen
stairs
a
large
elderly
woman
with
a
red
face
and
a
cap
worn
on
her
forehead
swept
me
a
magnificent
curtsey
as
i
crossed
the
threshold
your
honour
welcome
she
began
and
then
every
door
in
the
house
slammed
in
obedience
to
the
gust
that
drove
through
it
with
something
that
sounded
like
mend
ye
for
a
back
door
cadogan
abandoned
her
opening
speech
and
made
for
the
kitchen
stairs
improbable
as
it
may
appear
my
housekeeper
was
called
cadogan
a
name
made
locally
possible
by
being
pronounced
caydogawn
only
those
who
have
been
through
a
similar
experience
can
know
what
manner
of
afternoon
i
spent
i
am
a
martyr
to
colds
in
the
head
and
i
felt
one
coming
on
i
made
a
laager
in
front
of
the
fire
with
a
tattered
leather
screen
and
the
dinner
table
and
gradually
with
cigarettes
and
strong
tea
baffled
the
smell
of
must
and
cats
and
fervently
trusted
that
the
rain
might
avert
a
threatened
visit
from
my
landlord
i
was
then
but
superficially
acquainted
with
florence
mccarthy
knox
and
his
habits
at
about
when
the
room
had
warmed
up
and
my
cold
was
yielding
to
treatment
cadogan
entered
and
informed
me
that
mr
flurry
was
in
the
yard
and
would
be
thankful
if
i
go
out
to
him
for
he
could
come
in
many
are
the
privileges
of
the
female
sex
had
i
been
a
woman
i
should
unhesitatingly
have
said
that
i
had
a
cold
in
my
head
being
a
man
i
huddled
on
a
mackintosh
and
went
out
into
the
yard
my
landlord
was
there
on
horseback
and
with
him
there
was
a
man
standing
at
the
head
of
a
stout
grey
animal
i
recognised
with
despair
that
i
was
about
to
be
compelled
to
buy
a
horse
good
afternoon
major
said
knox
in
his
slow
brogue
it
rather
soon
to
be
paying
you
a
visit
but
i
thought
you
might
be
in
a
hurry
to
see
the
horse
i
was
telling
you
of
i
could
have
laughed
as
if
i
were
ever
in
a
hurry
to
see
a
horse
i
thanked
him
and
suggested
that
it
was
rather
wet
for
oh
it
nothing
when
you
used
to
it
replied
knox
his
gloveless
hands
were
red
and
wet
the
rain
ran
down
his
nose
and
his
covert
coat
was
soaked
to
a
sodden
brown
i
thought
that
i
did
not
want
to
become
used
to
it
my
relations
with
horses
have
been
of
a
purely
military
character
i
have
endured
the
sandhurst
i
have
galloped
for
an
impetuous
general
i
have
been
steward
at
regimental
races
but
none
of
these
feats
have
altered
my
opinion
that
the
horse
as
a
means
of
locomotion
is
obsolete
nevertheless
the
man
who
accepts
a
resident
magistracy
in
the
of
ireland
voluntarily
retires
into
the
prehistoric
age
to
institute
a
stable
became
inevitable
you
ought
to
throw
a
leg
over
him
said
knox
and
you
welcome
to
take
him
over
a
fence
or
two
if
you
like
he
a
nice
flippant
jumper
even
to
my
unexacting
eye
the
grey
horse
did
not
seem
to
promise
flippancy
nor
did
i
at
all
desire
to
find
that
quality
in
him
i
explained
that
i
wanted
something
to
drive
and
not
to
ride
well
that
a
fine
raking
horse
in
harness
said
knox
looking
at
me
with
his
serious
grey
eyes
and
you
drive
him
with
a
sop
of
hay
in
his
mouth
bring
him
up
here
michael
michael
abandoned
his
efforts
to
kick
the
grey
horse
forelegs
into
a
becoming
position
and
led
him
up
to
me
i
regarded
him
from
under
my
umbrella
with
a
quite
unreasonable
disfavour
he
had
the
dreadful
beauty
of
a
horse
in
a
as
chubby
as
wooden
and
as
conscientiously
dappled
but
it
was
unreasonable
to
urge
this
as
an
objection
and
i
was
incapable
of
finding
any
more
technical
drawback
yielding
to
circumstance
i
threw
my
leg
over
the
brute
and
after
pacing
gravely
round
the
quadrangle
that
formed
the
yard
and
jolting
to
my
entrance
gate
and
back
i
decided
that
as
he
had
neither
fallen
down
nor
kicked
me
off
it
was
worth
paying
pounds
for
him
if
only
to
get
in
out
of
the
rain
knox
accompanied
me
into
the
house
and
had
a
drink
he
was
a
fair
spare
young
man
who
looked
like
a
stable
boy
among
gentlemen
and
a
gentleman
among
stable
boys
he
belonged
to
a
clan
that
cropped
up
in
every
grade
of
society
in
the
county
from
sir
valentine
knox
of
castle
knox
down
to
the
auctioneer
knox
who
bore
the
attractive
title
of
larry
the
liar
so
far
as
i
could
judge
florence
mccarthy
of
that
ilk
occupied
a
shifting
position
about
midway
in
the
tribe
i
had
met
him
at
dinner
at
sir
valentine
i
had
heard
of
him
at
an
illicit
auction
held
by
larry
the
liar
of
brandy
stolen
from
a
wreck
they
were
black
protestants
all
of
them
in
virtue
of
their
descent
from
a
godly
soldier
of
cromwell
and
all
were
prepared
at
any
moment
of
the
day
or
night
to
sell
a
horse
you
be
apt
to
find
this
place
a
bit
lonesome
after
the
hotel
remarked
mr
flurry
sympathetically
as
he
placed
his
foot
in
its
steaming
boot
on
the
hob
but
it
a
fine
sound
house
anyway
and
lots
of
rooms
in
it
though
indeed
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
never
was
through
the
whole
of
them
since
the
time
my
denis
mccarthy
died
here
the
dear
knows
i
had
enough
of
it
that
time
he
paused
and
lit
a
cigarette
one
of
my
best
and
quite
thrown
away
upon
him
those
top
floors
now
he
resumed
i
would
make
too
free
with
them
there
some
of
them
would
jump
under
you
like
a
spring
bed
many
the
night
i
was
in
and
out
of
those
attics
following
my
poor
uncle
when
he
had
a
bad
turn
on
him
the
horrors
y
know
there
were
nights
he
never
stopped
walking
through
the
house
good
lord
will
i
ever
forget
the
morning
he
said
he
saw
the
devil
coming
up
the
avenue
at
the
two
horns
on
him
says
he
and
he
out
with
his
gun
and
shot
him
and
begad
it
was
his
own
donkey
knox
gave
a
couple
of
short
laughs
he
seldom
laughed
having
in
unusual
perfection
the
gravity
of
manner
that
is
bred
by
probably
from
the
habitual
repression
of
all
emotion
save
disparagement
the
autumn
evening
grey
with
rain
was
darkening
in
the
tall
windows
and
the
wind
was
beginning
to
make
bullying
rushes
among
the
shrubs
in
the
area
a
shower
of
soot
rattled
down
the
chimney
and
fell
on
the
hearthrug
more
rain
coming
said
knox
rising
composedly
you
have
to
put
a
goose
down
these
chimneys
some
day
soon
it
the
only
way
in
the
world
to
clean
them
well
i
for
the
road
you
come
out
on
the
grey
next
week
i
hope
the
hounds
be
meeting
here
give
a
roar
at
him
coming
in
at
his
jumps
he
threw
his
cigarette
into
the
fire
and
extended
a
hand
to
me
major
you
see
plenty
of
me
and
my
hounds
before
you
done
there
a
power
of
foxes
in
the
plantations
here
this
was
scarcely
reassuring
for
a
man
who
hoped
to
shoot
woodcock
and
i
hinted
as
much
oh
is
it
the
cock
said
mr
flurry
me
there
never
was
a
woodcock
yet
that
minded
hounds
now
no
more
than
they
mind
rabbits
the
best
shoots
ever
i
had
here
the
hounds
were
in
it
the
day
before
when
knox
had
gone
i
began
to
picture
myself
going
across
country
roaring
like
a
man
on
a
while
philippa
put
the
goose
down
the
chimney
but
when
i
sat
down
to
write
to
her
i
did
not
feel
equal
to
being
humorous
about
it
i
dilated
ponderously
on
my
cold
my
hard
work
and
my
loneliness
and
eventually
went
to
bed
at
ten
full
of
cold
shivers
and
hot
after
a
couple
of
hours
of
feverish
dozing
i
began
to
understand
what
had
driven
mccarthy
to
perambulate
the
house
by
night
cadogan
had
assured
me
that
the
pope
of
rome
had
a
betther
bed
undher
him
than
myself
was
i
down
on
the
new
flog
mattherass
the
old
masther
bought
in
father
scanlan
auction
by
the
smell
i
recognised
that
flog
meant
flock
otherwise
i
should
have
said
my
couch
was
stuffed
with
old
boots
i
have
seldom
spent
a
more
wretched
night
the
rain
drummed
with
soft
fingers
on
my
window
panes
the
house
was
full
of
noises
i
seemed
to
see
mccarthy
ranging
the
passages
with
flurry
at
his
heels
several
times
i
thought
i
heard
him
whisperings
seemed
borne
on
the
wind
through
my
keyhole
boards
creaked
in
the
room
overhead
and
once
i
could
have
sworn
that
a
hand
passed
groping
over
the
panels
of
my
door
i
am
i
may
admit
a
believer
in
ghosts
i
even
take
in
a
paper
that
deals
with
their
culture
but
i
can
not
pretend
that
on
that
night
i
looked
forward
to
a
manifestation
of
mccarthy
with
any
enthusiasm
the
morning
broke
stormily
and
i
woke
to
find
understudy
a
grimy
nephew
of
about
eighteen
standing
by
my
bedside
with
a
black
bottle
in
his
hand
there
no
bath
in
the
house
sir
was
his
reply
to
my
command
but
me
said
would
ye
like
a
taggeen
this
alternative
proved
to
be
a
glass
of
raw
whisky
i
declined
it
i
look
back
to
that
first
week
of
housekeeping
at
shreelane
as
to
a
comedy
excessively
badly
staged
and
striped
with
lurid
melodrama
towards
its
close
i
was
positively
for
raverty
and
i
had
not
a
single
clean
pair
of
boots
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
hold
the
convention
that
in
ireland
the
rain
never
ceases
day
or
night
but
i
must
say
that
my
first
november
at
shreelane
was
composed
of
weather
of
which
my
friend
flurry
knox
remarked
that
you
would
meet
a
christian
out
of
doors
unless
it
was
a
snipe
or
a
dispensary
doctor
to
this
lamentable
category
might
be
added
a
resident
magistrate
daily
shrouded
in
mackintosh
i
set
forth
for
the
petty
sessions
courts
of
my
wide
district
daily
in
the
inevitable
atmosphere
of
wet
frieze
and
perjury
i
listened
to
indictments
of
old
women
who
plucked
geese
alive
of
publicans
whose
hospitality
to
their
friends
broke
forth
uncontrollably
on
sunday
afternoons
of
parties
who
in
the
language
of
the
police
sergeant
were
subtly
defined
as
not
to
say
dhrunk
but
in
good
fighting
thrim
i
got
used
to
it
all
in
time
i
suppose
one
can
get
used
to
anything
i
even
became
callous
to
the
surprises
of
cadogan
cooking
as
the
weather
hardened
and
the
woodcock
came
in
and
one
by
one
i
discovered
and
nailed
up
the
rat
holes
i
began
to
find
life
endurable
and
even
to
feel
some
remote
sensation
of
when
the
grey
horse
turned
in
at
the
gate
of
shreelane
the
one
feature
of
my
establishment
to
which
i
could
not
become
inured
was
the
pervading
of
some
thing
or
things
which
for
my
own
convenience
i
summarised
as
mccarthy
there
were
nights
on
which
i
was
certain
that
i
heard
the
inebriate
shuffle
of
his
foot
overhead
the
touch
of
his
fumbling
hand
against
the
walls
there
were
dark
times
before
the
dawn
when
sounds
went
to
and
fro
the
moving
of
weights
the
creaking
of
doors
a
rapping
in
which
was
a
workmanlike
suggestion
of
the
undertaker
a
rumble
of
wheels
on
the
avenue
once
i
was
impelled
to
the
perhaps
imprudent
measure
of
cadogan
cadogan
taking
the
preliminary
precaution
of
crossing
herself
asked
me
fatefully
what
day
of
the
week
it
was
friday
she
repeated
after
me
friday
the
lord
save
us
was
a
friday
the
old
masther
was
buried
at
this
point
a
saucepan
opportunely
boiled
over
and
cadogan
fled
with
it
to
the
scullery
and
was
seen
no
more
in
the
process
of
time
i
brought
mccarthy
down
to
a
fine
point
on
friday
nights
he
made
coffins
and
drove
hearses
during
the
rest
of
the
week
he
rarely
did
more
than
patter
and
shuffle
in
the
attics
over
my
head
one
night
about
the
middle
of
december
i
awoke
suddenly
aware
that
some
noise
had
fallen
like
a
heavy
stone
into
my
dreams
as
i
felt
for
the
matches
it
came
again
the
long
grudging
groan
and
the
uncompromising
bang
of
the
cross
door
at
the
head
of
the
kitchen
stairs
i
told
myself
that
it
was
a
draught
that
had
done
it
but
it
was
a
perfectly
still
night
even
as
i
listened
a
sound
of
wheels
on
the
avenue
shook
the
stillness
the
thing
was
getting
past
a
joke
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
stealthily
groping
my
way
down
my
own
staircase
with
a
box
of
matches
in
my
hand
enforced
by
scientific
curiosity
but
none
the
less
armed
with
a
stick
i
stood
in
the
dark
at
the
top
of
the
back
stairs
and
listened
the
snores
of
cadogan
and
her
nephew
peter
rose
tranquilly
from
their
respective
lairs
i
descended
to
the
kitchen
and
lit
a
candle
there
was
nothing
unusual
there
except
a
great
portion
of
the
cadogan
wearing
apparel
which
was
arranged
at
the
fire
and
was
being
serenaded
by
two
crickets
whatever
had
opened
the
door
my
household
was
blameless
the
kitchen
was
not
attractive
yet
i
felt
indisposed
to
leave
it
none
the
less
it
appeared
to
be
my
duty
to
inspect
the
yard
i
put
the
candle
on
the
table
and
went
forth
into
the
outer
darkness
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
the
night
was
very
cold
and
so
dark
that
i
could
scarcely
distinguish
the
roofs
of
the
stables
against
the
sky
the
house
loomed
tall
and
oppressive
above
me
i
was
conscious
of
how
lonely
it
stood
in
the
dumb
and
barren
country
spirits
were
certainly
futile
creatures
childish
in
their
manifestations
stupidly
content
with
the
old
machinery
of
raps
and
rumbles
i
thought
how
fine
a
scene
might
be
played
on
a
stage
like
this
if
i
were
a
ghost
how
bluely
i
would
glimmer
at
the
windows
how
whimperingly
chatter
in
the
wind
something
whirled
out
of
the
darkness
above
me
and
fell
with
a
flop
on
the
ground
just
at
my
feet
i
jumped
backwards
in
point
of
fact
i
made
for
the
kitchen
door
and
with
my
hand
on
the
latch
stood
still
and
waited
nothing
further
happened
the
thing
that
lay
there
did
not
stir
i
struck
a
match
the
moment
of
tension
turned
to
bathos
as
the
light
flickered
on
nothing
more
fateful
than
a
dead
crow
dead
it
certainly
was
i
could
have
told
that
without
looking
at
it
but
why
should
it
at
some
considerable
period
after
its
death
fall
from
the
clouds
at
my
feet
but
did
it
fall
from
the
clouds
i
struck
another
match
and
stared
up
at
the
impenetrable
face
of
the
house
there
was
no
hint
of
solution
in
the
dark
windows
but
i
determined
to
go
up
and
search
the
rooms
that
gave
upon
the
yard
how
cold
it
was
i
can
feel
now
the
frozen
musty
air
of
those
attics
with
their
floors
and
furred
with
damp
i
went
softly
from
one
to
another
feeling
like
a
burglar
in
my
own
house
and
found
nothing
in
elucidation
of
the
mystery
the
windows
were
hermetically
shut
and
sealed
with
cobwebs
there
was
no
furniture
except
in
the
end
room
where
a
wardrobe
without
doors
stood
in
a
corner
empty
save
for
the
solemn
presence
of
a
monstrous
tall
hat
i
went
back
to
bed
cursing
those
powers
of
darkness
that
had
got
me
out
of
it
and
heard
no
more
my
landlord
had
not
failed
of
his
promise
to
visit
my
coverts
with
his
hounds
in
fact
he
fulfilled
it
rather
more
conscientiously
than
seemed
to
me
quite
wholesome
for
the
i
maintained
a
silence
which
i
felt
to
be
magnanimous
on
the
part
of
a
man
who
cared
nothing
for
hunting
and
a
great
deal
for
shooting
and
wished
the
hounds
more
success
in
the
slaughter
of
my
foxes
than
seemed
to
be
granted
to
them
i
met
them
all
one
red
frosty
evening
as
i
drove
down
the
long
hill
to
my
demesne
gates
flurry
at
their
head
in
his
shabby
pink
coat
and
dingy
breeches
the
hounds
trailing
dejectedly
behind
him
and
his
companions
what
luck
i
called
out
drawing
rein
as
i
met
them
none
said
mr
flurry
briefly
he
did
not
stop
neither
did
he
remove
his
pipe
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
his
eye
at
me
was
cold
and
sour
the
other
members
of
the
hunt
passed
me
with
equal
hauteur
i
thought
they
took
their
ill
luck
very
badly
on
foot
among
the
last
of
the
straggling
hounds
cracking
a
whip
and
swearing
comprehensively
at
them
all
slouched
my
friend
slipper
our
friendship
had
begun
in
court
the
relative
positions
of
the
dock
and
the
forming
no
obstacle
to
its
progress
and
had
been
cemented
during
several
days
tramping
after
snipe
he
was
as
usual
a
little
drunk
and
he
hailed
me
as
though
i
were
a
ship
ahoy
major
yeates
he
shouted
bringing
himself
up
with
a
lurch
against
my
cart
it
hunting
you
should
be
in
place
of
sending
poor
divils
to
gaol
but
i
hear
you
had
no
hunting
i
said
ye
heard
that
did
ye
slipper
rolled
upon
me
an
eye
like
that
of
a
profligate
pug
well
begor
ye
heard
no
more
than
the
thruth
but
where
are
all
the
foxes
said
i
begor
i
do
know
no
more
than
your
honour
and
shreelane
that
there
used
to
be
as
many
foxes
in
it
as
there
crosses
in
a
yard
of
check
well
well
i
say
nothin
for
it
only
that
it
quare
here
vaynus
naygress
slipper
uttered
a
yell
hoarse
with
whisky
in
adjuration
of
two
elderly
ladies
of
the
pack
who
had
profited
by
our
conversation
to
stray
away
into
an
adjacent
cottage
well
major
mr
flurry
as
cross
as
briars
and
he
have
me
ate
he
set
off
at
a
surprisingly
steady
run
cracking
his
whip
and
whooping
like
a
madman
i
hope
that
when
i
also
am
fifty
i
shall
be
able
to
run
like
slipper
that
frosty
evening
was
followed
by
three
others
like
unto
it
and
a
flight
of
woodcock
came
in
i
calculated
that
i
could
do
with
five
guns
and
i
despatched
invitations
to
shoot
and
dine
on
the
following
day
to
four
of
the
local
sportsmen
among
whom
was
of
course
my
landlord
i
remember
that
in
my
letter
to
the
latter
i
expressed
a
facetious
hope
that
my
bag
of
cock
would
be
more
successful
than
his
of
foxes
had
been
the
answers
to
my
invitations
were
not
what
i
expected
all
without
so
much
as
a
conventional
regret
declined
my
invitation
knox
added
that
he
hoped
the
bag
of
cock
would
be
to
my
liking
and
that
i
need
not
be
affraid
that
the
hounds
would
trouble
my
coverts
any
more
here
was
war
i
gazed
in
stupefaction
at
the
crooked
scrawl
in
which
my
landlord
had
declared
it
it
was
wholly
and
entirely
inexplicable
and
instead
of
going
to
sleep
comfortably
over
the
fire
and
my
newspaper
as
a
gentleman
should
i
spent
the
evening
in
irritated
ponderings
over
this
bewildering
and
exasperating
change
of
front
on
the
part
of
my
friendly
squireens
my
shoot
the
next
day
was
scarcely
a
success
i
shot
the
woods
in
company
with
my
gamekeeper
tim
connor
a
gentleman
whose
duties
mainly
consisted
in
limiting
the
poaching
privileges
to
his
personal
friends
and
whatever
my
offence
might
have
been
knox
could
have
wished
me
no
bitterer
punishment
than
hearing
the
unavailing
shouts
of
mark
cock
and
seeing
my
birds
winging
their
way
from
the
coverts
far
out
of
shot
tim
connor
and
i
got
ten
couple
between
us
it
might
have
been
thirty
if
my
neighbours
had
not
boycotted
me
for
what
i
could
only
suppose
was
the
slackness
of
their
hounds
i
was
that
night
having
walked
enough
for
three
men
and
i
slept
the
deep
insatiable
sleep
that
i
had
earned
it
was
somewhere
about
that
i
was
gradually
awakened
by
a
continuous
knocking
interspersed
with
muffled
calls
mccarthy
had
never
before
given
tongue
and
i
freed
one
ear
from
blankets
to
listen
then
i
remembered
that
peter
had
told
me
the
sweep
had
promised
to
arrive
that
morning
and
to
arrive
early
blind
with
sleep
and
fury
i
went
to
the
passage
window
and
thence
desired
the
sweep
to
go
to
the
devil
it
availed
me
little
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
i
could
hear
him
pacing
round
the
house
trying
the
windows
banging
at
the
doors
and
calling
upon
peter
cadogan
as
the
priests
of
baal
called
upon
their
god
at
six
i
had
fallen
into
a
troubled
doze
when
cadogan
knocked
at
my
door
and
imparted
the
information
that
the
sweep
had
arrived
my
answer
need
not
be
recorded
but
in
spite
of
it
the
door
opened
and
my
housekeeper
in
a
weird
effectively
lighted
by
the
orange
beams
of
her
candle
entered
my
room
god
forgive
me
i
never
seen
one
i
hate
as
much
as
that
sweep
she
began
he
these
three
hours
arrah
what
three
hours
no
but
all
night
raising
tallywack
and
tandem
round
the
house
to
get
at
the
chimbleys
well
for
heaven
sake
let
him
get
at
the
chimneys
and
let
me
go
to
sleep
i
answered
goaded
to
desperation
and
you
may
tell
him
from
me
that
if
i
hear
his
voice
again
i
shoot
him
cadogan
silently
left
my
bedside
and
as
she
closed
the
door
she
said
to
herself
the
lord
save
us
subsequent
events
may
be
briefly
summarised
at
i
was
awakened
anew
by
a
thunderous
sound
in
the
chimney
and
a
brick
crashed
into
the
fireplace
followed
at
a
short
interval
by
two
dead
jackdaws
and
their
nests
at
eight
i
was
informed
by
peter
that
there
was
no
hot
water
and
that
he
wished
the
divil
would
roast
the
same
sweep
at
when
i
came
down
to
breakfast
there
was
no
fire
anywhere
and
my
coffee
made
in
the
coachhouse
tasted
of
soot
i
put
on
an
overcoat
and
opened
my
letters
about
fourth
or
fifth
in
the
uninteresting
heap
came
one
in
an
egregiously
disguised
hand
sir
it
began
this
is
to
inform
you
your
unsportsmanlike
conduct
has
been
discovered
you
have
been
suspected
this
good
while
of
shooting
the
shreelane
foxes
it
is
known
now
you
do
worse
parties
have
seen
your
gamekeeper
going
regular
to
meet
the
saturday
early
train
at
salters
hill
station
with
your
grey
horse
under
a
cart
and
your
labels
on
the
boxes
and
we
know
as
well
as
agent
in
what
it
is
you
have
in
those
boxes
be
warned
in
your
wellwisher
i
read
this
through
twice
before
its
drift
became
apparent
and
i
realised
that
i
was
accused
of
improving
my
shooting
and
my
finances
by
the
simple
expedient
of
selling
my
foxes
that
is
to
say
i
was
in
a
worse
position
than
if
i
had
stolen
a
horse
or
murdered
cadogan
or
got
drunk
three
times
a
week
in
skebawn
for
a
few
moments
i
fell
into
wild
laughter
and
then
aware
that
it
was
rather
a
bad
business
to
let
a
lie
of
this
kind
get
a
start
i
sat
down
to
demolish
the
preposterous
charge
in
a
letter
to
flurry
knox
somehow
as
i
selected
my
sentences
it
was
borne
in
upon
me
that
if
the
letter
spoke
the
truth
circumstantial
evidence
was
rather
against
me
mere
lofty
repudiation
would
be
unavailing
and
by
my
infernal
facetiousness
about
the
woodcock
i
had
effectively
filled
in
the
case
against
myself
at
all
events
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
establish
a
basis
and
have
it
out
with
tim
connor
i
rang
the
bell
peter
is
tim
connor
about
the
place
he
is
not
sir
i
heard
him
say
he
was
going
west
the
hill
to
mend
the
bounds
fence
peter
face
was
covered
with
soot
his
eyes
were
red
and
he
coughed
ostentatiously
the
sweep
after
breaking
one
of
his
brushes
within
in
yer
bedroom
chimney
sir
he
went
on
with
all
the
satisfaction
of
his
class
in
announcing
domestic
calamity
above
on
the
roof
now
and
he
be
thankful
to
you
to
go
up
to
him
i
followed
him
upstairs
in
that
state
of
simmering
patience
that
any
employer
of
irish
labour
must
know
and
sympathise
with
i
climbed
the
rickety
ladder
and
squeezed
through
the
dirty
trapdoor
involved
in
the
ascent
to
the
roof
and
was
confronted
by
the
hideous
face
of
the
sweep
black
against
the
frosty
blue
sky
he
had
encamped
with
all
his
paraphernalia
on
the
flat
top
of
the
roof
and
was
good
enough
to
rise
and
put
his
pipe
in
his
pocket
on
my
arrival
good
morning
major
that
a
grand
view
you
have
up
here
said
the
sweep
he
was
evidently
far
too
well
bred
to
talk
shop
i
thravelled
every
roof
in
this
counthry
and
there
is
one
where
you
get
as
handsome
a
prospect
theoretically
he
was
right
but
i
had
not
come
up
to
the
roof
to
discuss
scenery
and
demanded
brutally
why
he
had
sent
for
me
the
explanation
involved
a
recital
of
the
special
genius
required
to
sweep
the
shreelane
chimneys
of
the
fact
that
the
sweep
had
in
infancy
been
sent
up
and
down
every
one
of
them
by
mccarthy
of
the
three
of
soot
that
by
his
peculiar
skill
he
had
this
morning
taken
from
the
kitchen
chimney
of
its
present
purity
the
draught
being
such
that
it
would
dhraw
up
a
young
cat
with
it
finally
realising
that
i
could
endure
no
more
he
explained
that
my
bedroom
chimney
had
got
what
he
called
a
wynd
in
it
and
he
proposed
to
climb
down
a
little
way
in
the
stack
to
try
would
he
get
to
come
at
the
brush
the
sweep
was
very
small
the
chimney
very
large
i
stipulated
that
he
should
have
a
rope
round
his
waist
and
despite
the
illegality
i
let
him
go
he
went
down
like
a
monkey
digging
his
toes
and
fingers
into
the
niches
made
for
the
purpose
in
the
old
chimney
peter
held
the
rope
i
lit
a
cigarette
and
waited
certainly
the
view
from
the
roof
was
worth
coming
up
to
look
at
it
was
rough
heathery
country
on
one
side
with
a
string
of
little
blue
lakes
running
like
a
turquoise
necklet
round
the
base
of
a
firry
hill
and
patches
of
pale
green
pasture
were
set
amidst
the
rocks
and
heather
a
silvery
flash
behind
the
undulations
of
the
hills
told
where
the
atlantic
lay
in
immense
plains
of
sunlight
i
turned
to
survey
with
an
owner
eye
my
own
grey
woods
and
straggling
plantations
of
larch
and
espied
a
man
coming
out
of
the
western
wood
he
had
something
on
his
back
and
he
was
walking
very
fast
a
rabbit
poacher
no
doubt
as
he
passed
out
of
sight
into
the
back
avenue
he
was
beginning
to
run
at
the
same
instant
i
saw
on
the
hill
beyond
my
western
boundaries
horsemen
scrambling
by
zigzag
ways
down
towards
the
wood
there
was
one
red
coat
among
them
it
came
first
at
the
gap
in
the
fence
that
tim
connor
had
gone
out
to
mend
and
with
the
others
was
lost
to
sight
in
the
covert
from
which
in
another
instant
came
clearly
through
the
frosty
air
a
shout
of
gone
to
ground
tremendous
horn
blowings
followed
then
all
in
the
same
moment
i
saw
the
hounds
break
in
full
cry
from
the
wood
and
come
stringing
over
the
grass
and
up
the
back
avenue
towards
the
yard
gate
were
they
running
a
fresh
fox
into
the
stables
i
do
not
profess
to
be
a
but
i
am
an
irishman
and
so
it
is
perhaps
superfluous
to
state
is
peter
we
forgot
the
sweep
as
if
he
had
never
existed
and
precipitated
ourselves
down
the
ladder
down
the
stairs
and
out
into
the
yard
one
side
of
the
yard
is
formed
by
the
and
a
long
stable
with
a
range
of
lofts
above
them
planned
on
the
heroic
scale
in
such
matters
that
obtained
in
ireland
formerly
these
join
the
house
at
the
corner
by
the
back
door
a
long
flight
of
stone
steps
leads
to
the
lofts
and
up
these
as
peter
and
i
emerged
from
the
back
door
the
hounds
were
struggling
almost
simultaneously
there
was
a
confused
clatter
of
hoofs
in
the
back
avenue
and
flurry
knox
came
stooping
at
a
gallop
under
the
archway
followed
by
three
or
four
other
riders
they
flung
themselves
from
their
horses
and
made
for
the
steps
of
the
loft
more
hounds
pressed
yelling
on
their
heels
the
din
was
indescribable
and
justified
cadogan
subsequent
remark
that
when
she
heard
the
noise
she
thought
the
end
of
the
world
and
the
divil
collecting
his
own
i
jostled
in
the
wake
of
the
party
and
found
myself
in
the
loft
wading
in
hay
and
nearly
deafened
by
the
clamour
that
was
bandied
about
the
high
roof
and
walls
at
the
farther
end
of
the
loft
the
hounds
were
raging
in
the
hay
encouraged
thereto
by
the
whoops
and
screeches
of
flurry
and
his
friends
high
up
in
the
gable
of
the
loft
where
it
joined
the
main
wall
of
the
house
there
was
a
small
door
and
i
noted
with
a
transient
surprise
that
there
was
a
long
ladder
leading
up
to
it
even
as
it
caught
my
eye
a
hound
fought
his
way
out
of
a
drift
of
hay
and
began
to
jump
at
the
ladder
throwing
his
tongue
vociferously
and
even
clambering
up
a
few
rungs
in
his
excitement
there
the
way
he
gone
roared
flurry
striving
through
hounds
and
hay
towards
the
ladder
trumpeter
has
him
what
up
there
back
of
the
door
major
i
do
remember
it
at
all
my
crimes
had
evidently
been
forgotten
in
the
supremacy
of
the
moment
while
i
was
futilely
asserting
that
had
the
fox
gone
up
the
ladder
he
could
not
possibly
have
opened
the
door
and
shut
it
after
him
even
if
the
door
led
anywhere
which
to
the
best
of
my
belief
it
did
not
the
door
in
question
opened
and
to
my
amazement
the
sweep
appeared
at
it
he
gesticulated
violently
and
over
the
tumult
was
heard
to
asseverate
that
there
was
nothing
above
there
only
a
way
into
the
flue
and
any
one
would
be
destroyed
with
the
soot
ah
go
to
blazes
with
your
soot
interrupted
flurry
already
up
the
ladder
i
followed
him
the
other
men
pressing
up
behind
me
that
trumpeter
had
made
no
mistake
was
instantly
brought
home
to
our
noses
by
the
reek
of
fox
that
met
us
at
the
door
instead
of
a
chimney
we
found
ourselves
in
a
dilapidated
bedroom
full
of
people
tim
connor
was
there
the
sweep
was
there
and
a
squalid
elderly
man
and
woman
on
whom
i
had
never
set
eyes
before
there
was
a
large
open
fireplace
black
with
the
soot
the
sweep
had
brought
down
with
him
and
on
the
table
stood
a
bottle
of
my
own
special
scotch
whisky
in
one
corner
of
the
room
was
a
pile
of
broken
and
beside
these
on
the
floor
lay
a
bag
in
which
something
kicked
flurry
looking
more
uncomfortable
and
nonplussed
than
i
could
have
believed
possible
listened
in
silence
to
the
ceaseless
harangue
of
the
elderly
woman
the
hounds
were
yelling
like
lost
spirits
in
the
loft
below
but
her
voice
pierced
the
uproar
like
a
bagpipe
it
was
an
unspeakably
vulgar
voice
yet
it
was
not
the
voice
of
a
countrywoman
and
there
were
frowzy
remnants
of
respectability
about
her
general
aspect
and
is
it
you
flurry
knox
that
calling
me
a
disgrace
disgrace
indeed
am
i
me
that
was
your
poor
mother
own
uncle
daughter
and
as
good
a
mccarthy
as
ever
stood
in
shreelane
what
followed
i
could
not
comprehend
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
sweep
kept
up
a
perpetual
undercurrent
of
explanation
to
me
as
to
how
he
had
got
down
the
wrong
chimney
i
noticed
that
his
breath
stank
of
whisky
scotch
not
the
native
variety
never
as
long
as
flurry
knox
lives
to
blow
a
horn
will
he
hear
the
last
of
the
day
that
he
ran
his
mother
first
cousin
to
ground
in
the
attic
never
while
cadogan
can
hold
a
basting
spoon
will
she
cease
to
recount
how
on
the
same
occasion
she
plucked
and
roasted
ten
couple
of
woodcock
in
one
torrid
hour
to
provide
luncheon
for
the
hunt
in
the
glory
of
this
achievement
her
confederacy
with
the
stowaways
in
the
attic
is
wholly
slurred
over
in
much
the
same
manner
as
the
startling
outburst
of
summons
for
trespass
brought
by
tim
connor
during
the
remainder
of
the
shooting
season
obscured
the
unfortunate
episode
of
the
bagged
fox
it
was
of
course
zeal
for
my
shooting
that
induced
him
to
assist
knox
disreputable
relations
in
the
deportation
of
my
foxes
and
i
have
allowed
it
to
remain
at
that
in
fact
the
only
things
not
allowed
to
remain
were
and
mccarthy
gannon
they
as
my
landlord
informed
me
in
the
midst
of
vast
apologies
had
been
permitted
to
squat
at
shreelane
until
my
tenancy
began
and
having
then
ostentatiously
and
abusively
left
the
house
they
had
with
the
connivance
of
the
cadogans
secretly
returned
to
roost
in
the
corner
attic
to
sell
foxes
under
the
ægis
of
my
name
and
to
make
inroads
on
my
belongings
they
retained
connection
with
the
outer
world
by
means
of
the
ladder
and
the
loft
and
with
the
house
in
general
and
my
whisky
in
particular
by
a
door
into
the
other
attics
a
door
concealed
by
the
wardrobe
in
which
reposed
mccarthy
tall
hat
it
is
with
the
greatest
regret
that
i
relinquish
the
prospect
of
writing
a
monograph
on
mccarthy
for
a
spiritualistic
journal
but
with
the
departure
of
his
relations
he
ceased
to
manifest
himself
and
neither
the
nailing
up
of
nor
the
rumble
of
the
cart
that
took
them
to
the
station
disturbed
my
sleep
for
the
future
i
understand
that
the
task
of
clearing
out
the
mccarthy
effects
was
of
a
nature
that
necessitated
two
glasses
of
whisky
per
man
and
if
the
remnants
of
rabbit
and
jackdaw
disinterred
in
the
process
were
anything
like
the
crow
that
was
thrown
out
of
the
window
at
my
feet
i
do
not
grudge
the
restorative
as
cadogan
remarked
to
the
sweep
a
turk
could
stand
it
ii
in
the
curranhilty
country
it
is
hardly
credible
that
i
should
have
been
induced
to
depart
from
my
usual
walk
of
life
by
a
creature
so
uninspiring
as
the
grey
horse
that
i
bought
from
flurry
knox
for
perhaps
it
was
the
monotony
of
being
questioned
by
every
other
person
with
whom
i
had
five
minutes
conversation
as
to
when
i
was
coming
out
with
the
hounds
and
being
further
informed
that
in
the
days
when
captain
browne
the
late
coastguard
officer
had
owned
the
grey
there
was
not
a
fence
between
this
and
mallow
big
enough
to
please
them
at
all
events
there
came
an
day
when
i
mounted
the
quaker
and
presented
myself
at
a
meet
of
knox
hounds
it
is
my
belief
that
six
out
of
every
dozen
people
who
go
out
hunting
are
disagreeably
conscious
of
a
nervous
system
and
two
out
of
the
six
are
in
what
is
brutally
called
a
blue
funk
i
was
not
in
a
blue
funk
but
i
was
conscious
not
only
of
a
nervous
system
but
of
the
anatomical
fact
that
i
possessed
large
round
legs
handsome
in
their
way
even
admirable
in
their
proper
sphere
but
singularly
ill
adapted
for
adhering
to
the
slippery
surfaces
of
a
saddle
by
a
fatal
intervention
of
providence
the
sport
on
this
my
first
day
in
the
was
such
as
i
could
have
enjoyed
from
a
the
was
on
this
occasion
a
relative
term
implying
long
stretches
of
unfenced
moorland
and
bog
anything
in
fact
save
a
field
the
hunt
itself
might
also
have
been
termed
a
relative
one
being
mainly
composed
of
relations
in
all
degrees
of
cousinhood
it
was
a
day
when
frost
and
sunshine
combined
went
to
one
head
like
iced
champagne
the
distant
sea
looked
like
the
mediterranean
and
for
four
sunny
hours
the
knox
relatives
and
i
followed
nine
couple
of
hounds
at
a
tranquil
footpace
along
the
hills
our
progress
mildly
enlivened
by
one
or
two
scrambles
in
the
shape
of
jumps
at
three
i
jogged
home
and
felt
within
me
the
newborn
desire
to
brag
to
peter
cadogan
of
the
quaker
doings
as
i
dismounted
rather
stiffly
in
my
own
yard
i
little
thought
that
the
result
would
be
that
three
weeks
later
i
should
find
myself
in
a
railway
carriage
at
an
early
hour
of
a
december
morning
in
company
with
flurry
knox
and
four
or
five
of
his
clan
journeying
towards
an
unknown
town
named
drumcurran
with
an
appropriate
number
of
horses
in
boxes
behind
us
and
a
van
full
of
hounds
in
front
knox
hounds
were
on
their
way
by
invitation
to
have
a
day
in
the
country
of
their
neighbours
the
curranhilty
harriers
and
with
amazing
fatuity
i
had
allowed
myself
to
be
cajoled
into
joining
the
party
a
northerly
shower
was
striking
in
long
spikes
on
the
glass
of
the
window
the
atmosphere
of
the
carriage
was
blue
with
tobacco
smoke
and
my
feet
in
a
pair
of
new
blucher
boots
had
sunk
into
a
species
of
arctic
sleep
well
you
got
my
letter
about
the
dance
at
the
hotel
said
flurry
knox
breaking
off
a
whispered
conversation
with
his
amateur
whip
jerome
hickey
and
sitting
down
beside
me
and
we
to
go
out
with
the
harriers
and
they
a
sure
fox
for
our
hounds
i
tell
you
you
have
the
best
fun
ever
you
had
it
a
great
country
to
ride
fine
honest
banks
that
you
can
come
racing
at
anywhere
you
like
hickey
a
saturnine
young
man
with
a
long
nose
and
a
black
torpedo
beard
returned
to
his
pocket
the
lancet
with
which
he
had
been
trimming
his
nails
they
like
the
tipperary
banks
he
said
you
climb
down
nine
feet
and
you
fall
the
rest
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
quaker
and
i
would
most
probably
fall
all
the
way
but
i
said
nothing
i
hear
tomsy
flood
has
a
good
horse
this
season
resumed
flurry
then
it
not
the
one
you
sold
him
said
the
doctor
i
take
my
oath
it
not
said
flurry
with
a
grin
i
believe
he
has
it
in
for
me
still
over
that
one
jerome
moustache
went
up
under
his
nose
and
showed
his
white
teeth
small
blame
to
him
when
you
sold
him
a
mare
that
was
wrong
of
both
her
do
you
know
what
he
did
major
yeates
the
mare
was
lame
going
into
the
fair
and
he
took
the
two
off
her
and
told
poor
flood
she
kicked
them
off
in
the
box
and
that
was
why
she
was
going
tender
and
he
was
so
drunk
he
believed
him
the
conversation
here
deepened
into
trackless
obscurities
of
i
took
out
my
stylograph
pen
and
finished
a
letter
to
philippa
with
a
feeling
that
it
would
probably
be
my
last
the
next
step
in
the
day
enjoyment
consisted
in
trotting
in
cavalcade
through
the
streets
of
drumcurran
with
another
northerly
shower
descending
upon
us
the
mud
splashing
in
my
face
and
my
feet
coming
torturingly
to
life
every
man
and
boy
in
the
town
ran
with
us
the
harriers
were
somewhere
in
the
tumult
ahead
and
the
quaker
began
to
pull
and
hump
his
back
ominously
i
arrived
at
the
meet
considerably
heated
and
found
myself
one
of
some
thirty
or
forty
riders
who
with
traps
and
bicycles
and
footpeople
were
jammed
in
a
narrow
muddy
road
we
were
late
and
a
move
was
immediately
made
across
a
series
of
grass
fields
all
considerately
furnished
with
gates
there
was
a
glacial
gleam
of
sunshine
and
people
began
to
turn
down
the
collars
of
their
coats
as
they
spread
over
the
field
i
observed
that
knox
was
no
longer
riding
with
old
captain
handcock
the
master
of
the
harriers
but
had
attached
himself
to
a
young
lady
with
effective
coils
of
dark
hair
and
a
grey
habit
she
was
riding
a
fidgety
black
mare
with
great
decision
and
a
not
disagreeable
swagger
it
was
at
about
this
moment
that
the
hounds
began
to
run
fast
and
silently
and
every
one
began
to
canter
this
is
nothing
at
all
said
hickey
thundering
alongside
of
me
on
a
huge
young
chestnut
there
might
have
been
a
hare
here
last
week
or
a
red
herring
this
morning
i
would
care
if
we
only
got
warm
us
for
the
matter
of
that
i
as
soon
hunt
a
cat
as
a
hare
i
was
already
getting
quite
enough
to
warm
me
the
respectable
grey
head
had
twice
disappeared
between
his
forelegs
in
a
brace
of
most
unsettling
bucks
and
all
my
experiences
at
the
at
sandhurst
did
not
prepare
me
for
the
sensation
of
jumping
a
briary
wall
with
a
heavy
drop
into
a
lane
so
narrow
that
each
horse
had
to
turn
at
right
angles
as
he
landed
i
did
not
so
turn
but
saved
myself
from
entire
disgrace
by
a
timely
clutch
at
the
mane
we
scrambled
out
of
the
lane
over
a
pile
of
stones
and
furze
bushes
and
at
the
end
of
the
next
field
were
confronted
by
a
tall
bank
everyone
always
excepting
myself
was
riding
with
that
furious
valour
which
is
so
conspicuous
when
neighbouring
hunts
meet
and
the
leading
charged
the
obstacle
at
steeplechase
speed
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
young
lady
in
the
grey
habit
sitting
square
and
strong
as
her
mare
topped
the
bank
with
flurry
and
the
redoubtable
tomsy
flood
riding
on
either
hand
i
followed
in
their
wake
with
a
blind
confidence
in
the
quaker
and
none
at
all
in
myself
he
refused
it
i
suppose
it
was
in
token
of
affection
and
gratitude
that
i
fell
upon
his
neck
at
all
events
i
had
reason
to
respect
his
judgment
as
before
i
had
recovered
myself
the
hounds
were
straggling
back
into
the
field
by
a
gap
lower
down
it
finally
appeared
that
the
hounds
could
do
no
more
with
the
line
they
had
been
hunting
and
we
proceeded
to
jog
interminably
i
knew
not
whither
during
this
unpleasant
process
flurry
knox
bestowed
on
me
many
items
of
information
chiefly
as
to
the
pangs
of
jealousy
he
was
inflicting
on
mr
flood
by
his
attentions
to
the
lady
in
the
grey
habit
miss
bobbie
bennett
she
have
all
old
handcock
money
one
of
these
days
she
his
niece
y
know
and
she
a
good
girl
to
ride
but
she
not
as
young
as
she
was
ten
years
ago
you
be
looking
at
a
chicken
a
long
time
before
you
thought
of
her
she
might
take
tomsy
some
day
if
she
do
any
better
he
stopped
and
looked
at
me
with
a
gleam
in
his
eye
come
on
and
i
introduce
you
to
her
before
however
this
privilege
could
be
mine
the
whole
cavalcade
was
stopped
by
a
series
of
distant
yells
which
apparently
conveyed
information
to
the
hunt
though
to
me
they
only
suggested
a
red
indian
scalping
his
enemy
the
yells
travelled
rapidly
nearer
and
a
young
man
with
a
scarlet
face
and
a
long
stick
sprang
upon
the
fence
and
explained
that
he
and
patsy
lorry
were
after
chasing
a
hare
two
miles
down
out
of
the
hill
above
and
a
dog
nor
a
one
with
them
but
themselves
and
she
was
lying
beat
out
under
a
bush
and
patsy
lorry
was
minding
her
until
the
hounds
would
come
i
had
a
vision
of
the
humane
patsy
lorry
fanning
the
hare
with
his
hat
but
apparently
nobody
else
found
the
fact
unusual
the
hounds
were
hurried
into
the
fields
the
hare
was
again
spurred
into
action
and
i
was
again
confronted
with
the
responsibilities
of
the
chase
after
the
first
five
minutes
i
had
discovered
several
facts
about
the
quaker
if
the
bank
was
above
a
certain
height
he
refused
it
irrevocably
if
it
accorded
with
his
ideas
he
got
his
forelegs
over
and
ploughed
through
the
rest
of
it
on
his
or
if
a
gripe
made
this
inexpedient
he
remained
poised
on
top
till
the
fabric
crumbled
under
his
weight
in
the
case
of
walls
he
butted
them
down
with
his
knees
or
squandered
them
with
his
these
operations
took
time
and
the
leaders
of
the
hunt
streamed
farther
and
farther
away
over
the
crest
of
a
hill
while
the
quaker
pursued
at
the
equable
gallop
of
a
horse
in
the
bayeux
tapestry
i
began
to
perceive
that
i
had
been
adopted
as
a
pioneer
by
a
small
band
of
followers
who
as
one
of
their
number
candidly
explained
liked
to
have
some
one
ahead
of
them
to
soften
the
banks
and
accordingly
waited
respectfully
till
the
quaker
had
made
the
rough
places
smooth
and
taken
the
raw
edge
off
the
walls
they
in
their
turn
showed
me
alternative
routes
when
the
obstacle
proved
above
the
quaker
limit
thus
in
ignoble
confederacy
i
and
the
offscourings
of
the
curranhilty
hunt
pursued
our
way
across
some
four
miles
of
country
when
at
length
we
parted
it
was
with
extreme
regret
on
both
sides
a
river
crossed
our
course
with
boggy
banks
pitted
deep
with
the
of
our
forerunners
i
suggested
it
to
the
quaker
and
discovered
that
nature
had
not
in
vain
endued
him
with
the
hindquarters
of
the
hippopotamus
i
presume
the
others
had
jumped
it
the
quaker
with
abysmal
flounderings
walked
through
and
heaved
himself
to
safety
on
the
farther
bank
it
was
the
dividing
of
the
ways
my
friendly
company
turned
aside
as
one
man
and
i
was
left
with
the
world
before
me
and
no
guide
save
the
in
the
grass
these
presently
led
me
to
a
road
on
the
other
side
of
which
was
a
bank
that
was
at
once
added
to
the
quaker
black
list
the
rain
had
again
begun
to
fall
heavily
and
was
soaking
in
about
my
elbows
i
suddenly
asked
myself
why
in
heaven
name
i
should
go
any
farther
no
adequate
reason
occurred
to
me
and
i
turned
in
what
i
believed
to
be
the
direction
of
drumcurran
i
rode
on
for
possibly
two
or
three
miles
without
seeing
a
human
being
until
from
the
top
of
a
hill
i
descried
a
solitary
lady
rider
i
started
in
pursuit
the
rain
kept
blurring
my
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
rider
was
a
schoolgirl
with
hair
hanging
down
her
back
and
that
her
horse
was
a
trifle
lame
i
pressed
on
to
ask
my
way
and
discovered
that
i
had
been
privileged
to
overtake
no
less
a
person
than
miss
bobbie
bennett
my
question
as
to
the
route
led
to
information
of
a
varied
character
miss
bennett
was
going
that
way
herself
her
mare
had
given
her
what
she
called
a
toss
and
a
half
whereby
she
had
strained
her
arm
and
the
mare
her
shoulder
her
habit
had
been
torn
and
she
had
lost
all
her
hairpins
i
an
awful
object
she
concluded
my
hair
the
plague
of
my
life
out
hunting
i
declare
i
wish
to
goodness
i
was
bald
i
struggled
to
the
level
of
the
occasion
with
an
appropriate
protest
she
had
really
very
brilliant
grey
eyes
and
her
complexion
was
undeniable
philippa
has
since
explained
to
me
that
it
is
a
mere
male
fallacy
that
any
woman
can
look
well
with
her
hair
down
her
back
but
i
have
always
maintained
that
miss
bobbie
bennett
with
the
rain
glistening
on
her
dark
tresses
looked
uncommonly
well
i
shall
never
get
it
dry
for
the
dance
she
complained
i
wish
i
could
help
you
said
i
perhaps
you
got
a
hairpin
or
two
about
you
said
she
with
a
glance
that
had
certainly
done
great
execution
before
now
i
disclaimed
the
possession
of
any
such
tokens
but
volunteered
to
go
and
look
for
some
at
a
neighbouring
cottage
the
cottage
door
was
shut
and
my
knockings
were
answered
by
a
elderly
man
conscious
of
my
own
absurdity
i
asked
him
if
he
had
any
hairpins
i
did
see
a
hare
this
week
he
responded
in
a
slow
bellow
hairpins
i
roared
has
your
wife
any
hairpins
she
has
not
then
as
an
she
dead
these
ten
years
at
this
point
a
young
woman
emerged
from
the
cottage
and
with
many
coy
grins
plucked
from
her
own
head
some
hairpins
crooked
and
grey
with
age
but
still
hairpins
and
as
such
well
worth
my
shilling
i
returned
with
my
spoil
to
miss
bennett
only
to
be
confronted
with
a
fresh
difficulty
the
arm
that
she
had
strained
was
too
stiff
to
raise
to
her
head
miss
bobbie
turned
her
handsome
eyes
upon
me
it
no
use
she
said
plaintively
i
ca
do
it
i
looked
up
and
down
the
road
there
was
no
one
in
sight
i
offered
to
do
it
for
her
miss
bennett
hair
was
long
thick
and
soft
it
was
also
slippery
with
rain
i
twisted
it
conscientiously
as
if
it
were
a
hay
rope
until
miss
bennett
with
an
irrepressible
shriek
told
me
it
would
break
off
i
coiled
the
rope
with
some
success
and
proceeded
to
nail
it
to
her
head
with
the
hairpins
at
all
the
most
critical
points
one
if
not
both
of
the
horses
moved
hairpins
were
driven
home
into
miss
bennett
skull
and
were
with
difficulty
plucked
forth
again
in
fact
a
more
harrowing
performance
can
hardly
be
imagined
but
miss
bennett
bore
it
with
the
heroism
of
a
i
was
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
the
coiffure
when
some
sound
made
me
look
round
and
i
beheld
at
a
distance
of
some
fifty
yards
the
entire
hunt
approaching
us
at
a
i
lost
my
head
and
instead
of
continuing
my
task
i
dropped
the
last
hairpin
as
if
it
were
and
kicked
the
quaker
away
to
the
far
side
of
the
road
thus
if
it
were
possible
giving
the
position
away
a
shade
more
generously
there
were
fifteen
riders
in
the
group
that
overtook
us
and
fourteen
of
them
including
the
whip
were
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
the
fifteenth
was
tomsy
flood
and
he
showed
no
sign
of
appreciation
he
shoved
his
horse
past
me
and
up
to
miss
bennett
his
red
moustache
bristling
truculence
in
every
outline
of
his
heavy
shoulders
his
green
coat
was
muddy
and
his
hat
had
a
cave
in
it
things
had
apparently
gone
ill
with
him
flurry
witticisms
held
out
for
about
two
miles
and
a
half
i
do
not
give
them
because
they
were
not
amusing
but
they
all
dealt
ultimately
with
the
animosity
that
i
in
common
with
himself
should
henceforth
have
to
fear
from
mr
flood
oh
he
a
holy
terror
he
said
conclusively
he
was
riding
the
tails
off
the
hounds
to
best
me
he
was
near
killing
me
twice
we
had
some
words
about
it
i
can
tell
you
i
very
near
took
my
whip
to
him
such
a
of
a
fellow
i
never
saw
he
would
so
much
as
stop
to
catch
bobbie
bennett
horse
when
i
picked
her
up
he
was
riding
so
jealous
his
own
girl
mind
you
and
such
a
crumpler
as
she
got
too
i
declare
she
knocked
a
groan
out
of
the
road
when
she
struck
it
she
does
seem
so
much
hurt
i
said
hurt
said
flurry
flicking
casually
at
a
hound
you
could
hurt
that
one
unless
you
took
a
hatchet
to
her
the
rain
had
reached
a
pitch
that
put
further
hunting
out
of
the
question
and
we
bumped
home
at
that
intolerable
pace
known
as
a
hound
jog
i
spent
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
over
a
fire
in
my
bedroom
in
the
royal
hotel
drumcurran
official
letters
to
write
having
mercifully
provided
me
with
an
excuse
for
seclusion
while
the
bar
and
the
hummed
below
and
the
quaker
gallop
wreaked
its
inevitable
revenge
upon
my
person
as
this
process
continued
and
i
became
proportionately
embittered
i
asked
myself
not
for
the
first
time
what
philippa
would
say
when
introduced
to
my
present
circle
of
acquaintances
i
have
already
mentioned
that
a
dance
was
to
take
place
at
the
hotel
given
as
far
as
i
could
gather
by
the
leading
lights
of
the
curranhilty
hunt
a
less
jocund
guest
than
the
wreck
who
at
the
pastoral
hour
of
nine
crept
stiffly
down
to
chase
the
glowing
hours
with
flying
feet
could
hardly
have
been
encountered
the
dance
was
held
in
the
and
a
conspicuous
object
outside
the
door
was
a
saucer
bath
full
of
something
that
looked
like
flour
rub
your
feet
in
that
said
flurry
that
french
chalk
they
had
time
to
do
the
floor
so
they
hit
on
this
dodge
i
complied
with
this
encouraging
direction
and
followed
him
into
the
room
dancing
had
already
begun
and
the
first
sight
that
met
my
eyes
was
miss
bennett
in
a
yellow
dress
waltzing
with
tomsy
flood
she
looked
very
handsome
and
in
spite
of
her
accident
she
was
getting
round
the
sticky
floor
and
her
still
more
sticky
partner
with
the
swing
of
a
racing
cutter
her
eye
caught
mine
immediately
and
with
confidence
clearly
our
acquaintance
that
in
the
space
of
twenty
minutes
had
blossomed
tropically
into
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
wither
nor
was
i
myself
allowed
to
wither
men
known
and
unknown
plied
me
with
partners
till
my
shirt
cuff
was
black
with
names
and
the
number
of
dances
stretched
away
into
the
blue
distance
of
morning
the
music
was
supplied
by
the
organist
of
the
church
who
played
with
religious
unction
and
at
the
pace
of
a
processional
hymn
i
put
forth
into
the
mêlée
with
a
junior
bennett
inferior
in
calibre
to
miss
bobbie
but
a
strong
goer
and
i
fear
made
but
a
sorry
début
in
the
eyes
of
drumcurran
at
every
other
moment
i
bumped
into
the
unforeseen
orbits
of
those
who
reversed
and
of
those
who
walked
their
partners
backwards
down
the
room
with
faces
of
ineffable
supremacy
being
unskilled
in
these
intricacies
of
an
elder
civilisation
the
younger
miss
bennett
fared
but
ingloriously
at
my
hands
the
music
pounded
interminably
on
until
the
heel
of
mr
flood
put
a
period
to
our
sufferings
the
nasty
dirty
filthy
brute
shrieked
the
younger
miss
bennett
in
a
single
breath
he
torn
the
gown
off
my
back
she
whirled
me
to
the
we
parted
mutually
unregretted
at
its
door
and
by
i
fear
common
consent
evaded
our
second
dance
together
many
many
times
during
the
evening
i
asked
myself
why
i
did
not
go
to
bed
perhaps
it
was
the
remembrance
that
my
bed
was
situated
some
ten
feet
above
the
piano
in
a
direct
line
but
whatever
was
the
reason
the
night
wore
on
and
found
me
still
working
my
way
down
my
shirt
cuff
i
sat
out
as
much
as
possible
and
found
my
partners
to
be
as
a
body
pretty
talkative
and
ill
dressed
and
during
the
evening
i
had
many
and
varied
opportunities
of
observing
the
rapid
progress
of
flirtation
with
miss
bobbie
bennett
from
no
to
no
they
were
invisible
that
they
were
behind
a
screen
in
the
might
be
inferred
from
mr
flood
thundercloud
presence
in
the
passage
outside
at
no
the
young
lady
emerged
for
one
of
her
dances
with
me
it
was
a
barn
dance
and
particularly
trying
to
my
momently
stiffening
muscles
but
miss
bobbie
whether
in
dancing
or
sitting
out
went
in
for
the
rigour
of
the
game
she
was
in
as
hard
condition
as
one
of
her
uncle
hounds
and
for
a
full
fifteen
minutes
i
capered
and
swooped
beside
her
larding
the
lean
earth
as
i
went
and
replying
but
spasmodically
to
her
even
flow
of
conversation
that
take
the
stiffness
out
of
you
she
exclaimed
as
the
organist
slowed
down
reverentially
to
a
conclusion
i
had
a
bet
with
flurry
knox
over
that
dance
he
said
you
were
up
to
my
weight
at
the
pace
i
led
her
forth
to
the
refreshment
table
and
was
watching
with
awe
her
fearless
consumption
of
claret
cup
that
i
would
not
have
touched
for
a
sovereign
when
flurry
with
a
partner
on
his
arm
strolled
past
us
well
you
won
the
gloves
miss
bobbie
he
said
do
you
wish
you
may
get
them
gloves
without
the
mr
knox
replied
miss
bennett
in
a
voice
loud
enough
to
reach
the
end
of
the
passage
where
thomas
flood
was
burying
his
nose
in
a
very
brown
your
hair
coming
down
retorted
flurry
ask
major
yeates
if
he
can
spare
you
a
few
hairpins
swifter
than
lightning
miss
bennett
hurled
a
macaroon
at
her
retreating
foe
missed
him
and
subsided
laughing
on
to
a
sofa
i
mopped
my
brow
and
took
my
seat
beside
her
wondering
how
much
longer
i
could
live
up
to
the
social
exigencies
of
drumcurran
miss
bennett
however
proved
excellent
company
she
told
me
artfully
and
inch
by
inch
all
that
mr
flood
had
said
to
her
on
the
subject
of
my
she
admitted
that
she
had
as
a
punishment
cut
him
out
of
three
dances
and
given
them
to
flurry
knox
when
i
remarked
that
in
fairness
they
should
have
been
given
to
me
she
darted
a
very
attractive
glance
at
me
and
pertinently
observed
that
i
had
not
asked
for
them
as
steals
the
dawn
into
a
fevered
room
and
says
be
of
good
cheer
the
day
is
born
so
did
the
rumour
of
supper
pass
among
the
chaperons
male
and
female
it
was
obviously
due
to
a
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
that
bennett
was
apportioned
to
me
and
i
found
myself
in
the
gratifying
position
of
heading
with
her
the
procession
to
supper
my
impressions
of
bennett
are
few
but
salient
she
wore
an
satin
dress
and
filled
it
tightly
wisely
mistrusting
the
hotel
supper
she
had
imported
sandwiches
and
cake
in
a
and
warmed
by
two
glasses
of
sherry
she
made
me
the
recipient
of
the
remarkable
confidence
that
she
had
but
two
back
teeth
in
her
head
but
thank
god
they
met
when
with
the
other
starving
men
i
fell
upon
the
remains
of
the
feast
i
regretted
that
i
had
declined
her
offer
of
a
sandwich
of
the
remainder
of
the
evening
i
am
unable
to
give
a
detailed
account
let
it
not
for
one
instant
be
imagined
that
i
had
looked
upon
the
wine
of
the
royal
hotel
when
it
was
red
or
indeed
any
other
colour
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
espied
an
inconspicuous
corner
in
the
entrance
hall
and
there
i
first
smoked
a
cigarette
and
subsequently
sank
into
uneasy
sleep
through
my
dreams
i
was
aware
of
the
measured
pounding
of
the
piano
of
the
clatter
of
glasses
at
the
bar
of
wheels
in
the
street
and
then
more
clearly
of
flurry
voice
assuring
miss
bennett
that
if
she
only
wait
for
another
dance
he
get
the
out
of
bed
to
do
her
hair
for
her
then
again
oblivion
at
some
later
period
i
was
dropping
down
a
chasm
on
the
quaker
back
and
landing
with
a
shock
i
was
twisting
his
mane
into
a
chignon
when
he
turned
round
his
head
and
caught
my
arm
in
his
teeth
i
awoke
with
the
dew
of
terror
on
my
forehead
to
find
miss
bennett
leaning
over
me
in
a
scarlet
cloak
with
a
hood
over
her
head
and
shaking
me
by
my
coat
sleeve
major
yeates
she
began
at
once
in
a
hurried
whisper
i
want
you
to
find
flurry
knox
and
tell
him
there
a
plan
to
feed
his
hounds
at
six
this
morning
so
as
to
spoil
their
hunting
how
do
you
know
i
asked
jumping
up
my
little
brother
told
me
he
came
in
with
us
to
see
the
dance
and
he
was
hanging
round
in
the
stables
and
he
heard
one
of
the
men
telling
another
there
was
a
dead
mule
in
an
outhouse
in
alley
all
cut
up
ready
to
give
to
knox
hounds
but
why
should
they
get
it
i
asked
in
sleepy
stupidity
is
it
fill
them
up
with
an
old
mule
just
before
they
going
out
hunting
flashed
miss
bennett
hurry
and
tell
knox
do
let
tomsy
flood
see
you
telling
him
or
any
one
else
oh
then
it
mr
flood
game
i
said
grasping
the
situation
at
length
it
is
said
miss
bennett
suddenly
turning
scarlet
he
a
disgrace
i
ashamed
of
him
i
done
with
him
i
resisted
a
strong
disposition
to
shake
miss
bennett
by
the
hand
i
ca
wait
she
continued
i
made
my
mother
drive
back
a
mile
she
does
know
a
thing
about
it
i
said
i
left
my
purse
in
the
do
tell
a
soul
but
flurry
she
was
off
and
upon
my
incapable
shoulders
rested
the
responsibility
of
the
enterprise
it
was
past
four
and
the
last
bars
of
the
last
waltz
were
being
played
at
the
bar
a
knot
of
men
with
flurry
in
their
midst
were
tossing
odd
man
out
for
a
bottle
of
champagne
flurry
was
not
in
the
least
drunk
a
circumstance
worthy
of
remark
in
his
present
company
and
i
got
him
out
into
the
hall
and
unfolded
my
tidings
the
light
of
battle
lit
in
his
eye
as
he
listened
i
knew
by
tomsy
he
was
shaping
for
mischief
he
said
coolly
taken
as
much
liquor
as
stiffen
a
tinker
and
he
only
this
minute
hold
on
till
i
get
jerome
hickey
and
charlie
knox
they
sober
i
be
back
in
a
minute
i
was
not
present
at
the
council
of
war
thus
hurriedly
convened
i
was
merely
informed
when
they
returned
that
we
were
all
to
hurry
on
my
best
evening
pumps
have
never
recovered
the
subsequent
proceedings
they
with
my
swelled
and
aching
feet
inside
them
were
raced
down
one
filthy
lane
after
another
until
somewhere
on
the
outskirts
of
drumcurran
flurry
pushed
open
the
gate
of
a
yard
and
went
in
it
was
nearly
five
on
that
raw
december
morning
low
down
in
the
sky
a
hazy
moon
shed
a
diffused
light
all
the
surrounding
houses
were
still
and
dark
at
our
footsteps
an
angry
bark
or
two
came
from
inside
the
stable
whisht
said
flurry
i
say
a
word
to
them
before
i
open
the
door
at
his
voice
a
chorus
of
hysterical
welcome
arose
without
more
delay
he
flung
open
the
stable
door
and
instantly
we
were
all
in
a
rush
of
hounds
there
was
not
a
moment
lost
flurry
started
at
a
quick
run
out
of
the
yard
with
the
whole
pack
pattering
at
his
heels
charley
knox
vanished
hickey
and
i
followed
the
hounds
splashing
into
puddles
and
hobbling
over
patches
of
broken
stones
till
we
left
the
town
behind
and
hedges
arose
on
either
hand
here
the
house
said
flurry
stopping
short
at
a
low
entrance
gate
many
the
time
i
been
here
when
his
father
had
it
it
be
a
queer
thing
if
i
ca
find
a
window
i
can
manage
and
the
old
cook
he
has
is
as
deaf
as
the
dead
he
and
doctor
hickey
went
in
at
the
gate
with
the
hounds
i
hesitated
ignobly
in
the
mud
this
is
an
job
said
flurry
in
a
whisper
closing
the
gate
in
my
face
you
best
keep
clear
of
i
accepted
his
advice
but
i
may
admit
that
before
i
turned
for
home
a
sash
was
gently
raised
a
light
had
sprung
up
in
one
of
the
lower
windows
and
i
heard
flurry
voice
saying
over
over
over
to
his
hounds
there
seemed
to
me
to
be
no
interval
at
all
between
these
events
and
the
moment
when
i
woke
in
bright
sunlight
to
find
hickey
standing
by
my
bedside
in
a
red
coat
with
a
tall
glass
in
his
hand
it
nine
he
said
i
just
after
waking
flurry
knox
there
was
one
stirring
in
the
hotel
till
i
went
down
and
pulled
the
from
under
the
kitchen
table
it
well
for
us
the
meet
in
the
town
and
your
grey
horse
has
four
legs
on
him
the
size
of
bolsters
this
morning
he
wo
be
fit
to
go
out
i
afraid
drink
this
anyway
you
in
the
want
of
it
hickey
eyelids
were
rather
pink
but
his
hand
was
as
steady
as
a
rock
the
was
singularly
untempting
what
happened
last
night
i
asked
eagerly
as
i
gulped
it
oh
it
all
went
off
very
nicely
thank
you
said
hickey
twisting
his
black
beard
to
a
point
we
benched
as
many
of
the
hounds
in
bed
as
fit
and
we
shut
the
lot
into
the
room
we
had
them
just
comfortable
when
we
heard
his
latchkey
below
at
the
door
he
broke
off
and
began
to
snigger
well
i
said
sitting
bolt
upright
well
he
got
in
at
last
and
he
lit
a
candle
then
that
took
him
five
minutes
he
was
pretty
tight
we
were
looking
at
him
over
the
banisters
until
he
started
to
come
up
and
according
as
he
came
up
we
went
on
up
the
top
flight
he
stood
admiring
his
candle
for
a
while
on
the
landing
and
we
wondered
he
did
hear
the
hounds
snuffing
under
the
door
he
opened
it
then
and
on
the
minute
three
of
them
bolted
out
between
his
legs
hickey
again
paused
to
indulge
in
mephistophelian
laughter
well
you
know
he
went
on
when
a
man
in
poor
tomsy
condition
sees
six
dogs
jumping
out
of
his
bed
he
apt
to
make
a
wrong
diagnosis
he
gave
a
roar
and
pitched
the
candlestick
at
them
and
ran
for
his
life
downstairs
and
all
the
hounds
after
him
away
screeches
that
devil
flurry
pelting
downstairs
on
top
of
them
in
the
dark
i
believe
i
screeched
too
good
heavens
i
gasped
i
was
well
out
of
that
well
you
were
admitted
the
doctor
however
tomsy
bested
them
in
the
dark
and
he
got
to
ground
in
the
pantry
i
heard
the
cups
and
saucers
go
as
he
slammed
the
door
on
the
hounds
noses
and
the
minute
he
was
in
flurry
turned
the
key
on
him
real
dogs
tomsy
my
buck
says
flurry
just
to
quiet
him
and
there
we
left
him
was
he
hurt
i
asked
conscious
of
the
triviality
of
the
question
well
he
lost
his
brush
replied
hickey
old
merrylegs
tore
the
off
him
we
got
them
on
the
floor
when
we
struck
a
light
flurry
has
them
to
nail
on
his
kennel
door
charley
knox
had
a
pleasant
time
too
he
went
on
with
the
man
that
brought
the
of
meat
to
the
stable
we
picked
out
the
tastiest
bits
and
arranged
them
round
flood
breakfast
table
for
him
they
smelt
very
nice
well
i
delaying
you
with
my
talking
flurry
hounds
had
the
run
of
the
season
that
day
i
saw
it
admirably
throughout
from
miss
bennett
pony
cart
she
drove
extremely
well
in
spite
of
her
strained
arm
iii
trinket
colt
it
was
petty
sessions
day
in
skebawn
a
cold
grey
day
of
february
a
case
of
trespass
had
dragged
its
burden
of
cross
summonses
and
cross
swearing
far
into
the
afternoon
and
when
i
left
the
bench
my
head
was
singing
from
the
bellowings
of
the
attorneys
and
the
smell
of
their
clients
was
heavy
upon
my
palate
the
streets
still
testified
to
the
fact
that
it
was
market
day
and
i
evaded
with
difficulty
the
sinuous
course
of
carts
full
of
soddenly
screwed
people
and
steered
an
equally
devious
one
for
myself
among
the
groups
anchored
round
the
doors
of
the
skebawn
possesses
among
its
legion
of
one
establishment
which
timorously
and
almost
imperceptibly
proffers
tea
to
the
thirsty
i
turned
in
there
as
was
my
custom
on
court
days
and
found
the
little
dingy
den
known
as
the
ladies
in
the
occupancy
of
my
friend
florence
mccarthy
knox
who
was
drinking
strong
tea
and
eating
buns
with
serious
simplicity
it
was
a
first
and
quite
unexpected
glimpse
of
that
domesticity
that
has
now
become
a
marked
feature
in
his
character
you
the
very
man
i
wanted
to
see
i
said
as
i
sat
down
beside
him
at
the
table
a
man
i
know
in
england
who
is
not
much
of
a
judge
of
character
has
asked
me
to
buy
him
a
down
here
and
as
i
should
rather
be
stuck
by
a
friend
than
a
dealer
i
wish
you
take
over
the
job
flurry
poured
himself
out
another
cup
of
tea
and
dropped
three
lumps
of
sugar
into
it
in
silence
finally
he
said
there
is
a
in
this
country
that
be
seen
dead
with
at
a
pig
fair
this
was
discouraging
from
the
premier
authority
on
in
the
district
but
it
is
six
weeks
since
you
told
me
you
had
the
finest
filly
in
your
stables
that
was
ever
foaled
in
the
county
cork
i
protested
what
wrong
with
her
oh
is
it
that
filly
said
knox
with
a
lenient
smile
she
gone
these
three
weeks
from
me
i
swapped
her
and
for
a
ironmonger
colt
and
after
that
i
swapped
the
colt
and
for
that
bandon
horse
i
rode
last
week
at
your
place
and
after
that
again
i
sold
the
bandon
horse
for
to
old
welply
and
i
had
to
give
him
back
a
couple
of
sovereigns
you
see
i
did
pretty
well
with
the
filly
after
all
yes
yes
oh
rather
i
assented
as
one
dizzily
accepts
the
propositions
of
a
bimetallist
and
you
do
know
of
anything
else
the
room
in
which
we
were
seated
was
closely
screened
from
the
shop
by
a
door
with
a
window
in
it
several
of
the
panes
were
broken
and
at
this
juncture
two
voices
that
had
for
some
time
carried
on
a
discussion
forced
themselves
upon
our
attention
begging
your
pardon
for
contradicting
you
said
the
voice
of
mcdonald
proprietress
of
the
and
a
leading
light
in
skebawn
dissenting
circles
shrilly
tremulous
with
indignation
if
the
servants
i
recommend
you
wo
stop
with
you
it
no
fault
of
mine
if
respectable
young
girls
are
set
picking
grass
out
of
your
gravel
in
place
of
their
proper
work
certainly
they
will
give
warning
the
voice
that
replied
struck
me
as
being
a
notable
one
and
imperious
when
i
take
a
barefooted
slut
out
of
a
cabin
i
do
expect
her
to
dictate
to
me
what
her
duties
are
flurry
jerked
up
his
chin
in
a
noiseless
laugh
it
my
grandmother
he
whispered
i
bet
you
mcdonald
do
get
much
change
out
of
her
if
i
set
her
to
clean
the
i
expect
her
to
obey
me
continued
the
voice
in
accents
that
would
have
made
me
clean
forty
had
she
desired
me
to
do
so
very
well
retorted
mcdonald
if
that
the
way
you
treat
your
servants
you
need
come
here
again
looking
for
them
i
consider
your
conduct
is
neither
that
of
a
lady
nor
a
christian
do
you
indeed
replied
flurry
grandmother
well
your
opinion
does
greatly
distress
me
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
think
you
much
of
a
judge
did
i
tell
you
she
score
murmured
flurry
who
was
by
this
time
applying
his
eye
to
a
hole
in
the
muslin
curtain
she
off
he
went
on
returning
to
his
tea
she
a
great
character
if
she
a
day
and
she
as
sound
on
her
legs
as
a
did
you
see
that
old
shandrydan
of
hers
in
the
street
a
while
ago
and
a
fellow
on
the
box
with
a
red
beard
on
him
like
robinson
crusoe
that
old
mare
that
was
on
the
near
side
trinket
her
name
is
is
mighty
near
clean
bred
i
can
tell
you
her
foals
are
worth
a
bit
of
money
i
had
heard
of
old
knox
of
aussolas
indeed
i
had
seldom
dined
out
in
the
neighbourhood
without
hearing
some
new
story
of
her
and
her
remarkable
ménage
but
it
had
not
yet
been
my
privilege
to
meet
her
well
now
went
on
flurry
in
his
slow
voice
i
tell
you
a
thing
that
just
come
into
my
head
my
grandmother
promised
me
a
foal
of
trinket
the
day
i
was
and
that
five
years
ago
and
deuce
a
one
i
got
from
her
yet
you
never
were
at
aussolas
no
you
were
not
well
i
tell
you
the
place
there
is
like
a
circus
with
horses
she
has
a
couple
of
score
of
them
running
wild
in
the
woods
like
deer
oh
come
i
said
i
a
bit
of
a
liar
myself
well
she
has
a
dozen
of
them
anyhow
rattling
good
colts
too
some
of
them
but
they
might
as
well
be
donkeys
for
all
the
good
they
are
to
me
or
any
one
it
not
once
in
three
years
she
sells
one
and
there
she
has
them
walking
after
her
for
bits
of
sugar
like
a
lot
of
dirty
lapdogs
ended
flurry
with
disgust
well
what
your
plan
do
you
want
me
to
make
her
a
bid
for
one
of
the
lapdogs
i
was
thinking
replied
flurry
with
great
deliberation
that
my
birthday
this
week
and
maybe
i
could
work
a
colt
of
trinket
she
has
out
of
her
in
honour
of
the
occasion
and
sell
your
grandmother
birthday
present
to
me
just
that
i
suppose
answered
flurry
with
a
slow
wink
a
few
days
afterwards
a
letter
from
knox
informed
me
that
he
had
squared
the
old
lady
and
it
would
be
all
right
about
the
colt
he
further
told
me
that
knox
had
been
good
enough
to
offer
me
with
him
a
day
snipe
shooting
on
the
celebrated
aussolas
bogs
and
he
proposed
to
drive
me
there
the
following
monday
if
convenient
most
people
found
it
convenient
to
shoot
the
aussolas
snipe
bog
when
they
got
the
chance
eight
on
the
following
monday
morning
saw
flurry
myself
and
a
groom
packed
into
a
dogcart
with
portmanteaus
and
two
rampant
red
setters
it
was
a
long
drive
twelve
miles
at
least
and
a
very
cold
one
we
passed
through
long
tracts
of
pasture
country
fraught
for
flurry
with
memories
of
runs
which
were
recorded
for
me
fence
by
fence
in
every
one
of
which
the
biggest
in
the
country
had
gone
to
ground
with
not
two
feet
measured
accurately
on
the
handle
of
the
whip
between
him
and
the
leading
hound
through
bogs
that
imperceptibly
melted
into
lakes
and
finally
down
and
down
into
a
valley
where
the
of
aussolas
clustered
darkly
round
a
glittering
lake
and
all
but
hid
the
grey
roofs
and
pointed
gables
of
aussolas
castle
there
a
nice
stretch
of
a
demesne
for
you
remarked
flurry
pointing
downwards
with
the
whip
and
one
little
old
woman
holding
it
all
in
the
heel
of
her
fist
well
able
to
hold
it
she
is
too
and
always
was
and
she
live
twenty
years
yet
if
it
only
to
spite
the
whole
lot
of
us
and
when
all
said
and
done
goodness
knows
how
leave
it
it
strikes
me
you
were
lucky
to
keep
her
up
to
her
promise
about
the
colt
i
said
flurry
administered
a
composing
kick
to
the
ceaseless
strivings
of
the
red
setters
under
the
seat
i
used
to
be
rather
a
pet
with
her
he
said
after
a
pause
but
mind
you
i
have
got
him
yet
and
if
she
gets
any
notion
i
want
to
sell
him
i
never
get
him
so
say
nothing
about
the
business
to
her
the
tall
gates
of
aussolas
shrieked
on
their
hinges
as
they
admitted
us
and
shut
with
a
clang
behind
us
in
the
faces
of
an
old
mare
and
a
couple
of
young
horses
who
foiled
in
their
break
for
the
excitements
of
the
outer
world
turned
and
galloped
defiantly
on
either
side
of
us
flurry
admirable
cob
hammered
on
regardless
of
all
things
save
his
duty
he
the
only
one
i
have
that
i
trust
myself
here
with
said
his
master
flicking
him
approvingly
with
the
whip
there
are
plenty
of
people
afraid
to
come
here
at
all
and
when
my
grandmother
goes
out
driving
she
has
a
boy
on
the
box
with
a
basket
full
of
stones
to
peg
at
them
talk
of
the
dickens
here
she
is
herself
a
short
upright
old
woman
was
approaching
preceded
by
a
white
woolly
dog
with
sore
eyes
and
a
bark
like
a
tin
trumpet
we
both
got
out
of
the
trap
and
advanced
to
meet
the
lady
of
the
manor
i
may
summarise
her
attire
by
saying
that
she
looked
as
if
she
had
robbed
a
scarecrow
her
face
was
small
and
incongruously
refined
the
skinny
hand
that
she
extended
to
me
had
the
grubby
tan
that
bespoke
the
professional
gardener
and
was
decorated
with
a
magnificent
diamond
ring
on
her
head
was
a
massive
purple
velvet
bonnet
i
am
very
glad
to
meet
you
major
yeates
she
said
with
an
precision
of
utterance
your
grandfather
was
a
dancing
partner
of
mine
in
old
days
at
the
castle
when
he
was
a
handsome
young
there
and
i
was
you
may
judge
for
yourself
what
i
was
she
ended
with
a
startling
little
hoot
of
laughter
and
i
was
aware
that
she
quite
realised
the
world
opinion
of
her
and
was
indifferent
to
it
our
way
to
the
bogs
took
us
across
knox
home
farm
and
through
a
large
field
in
which
several
young
horses
were
grazing
there
now
that
my
fellow
said
flurry
pointing
to
a
colt
the
chestnut
with
the
white
diamond
on
his
forehead
he
run
into
three
figures
before
he
done
but
we
not
tell
that
to
the
old
lady
the
famous
aussolas
bogs
were
as
full
of
snipe
as
usual
and
a
good
deal
fuller
of
water
than
any
bogs
i
had
ever
shot
before
i
was
on
my
day
and
flurry
was
not
and
as
he
is
ordinarily
an
infinitely
better
snipe
shot
than
i
i
felt
at
peace
with
the
world
and
all
men
as
we
walked
back
wet
through
at
five
the
sunset
had
waned
and
a
big
white
moon
was
making
the
eastern
tower
of
aussolas
look
like
a
thing
in
a
fairy
tale
or
a
play
when
we
arrived
at
the
hall
door
an
individual
whom
i
recognised
as
the
robinson
crusoe
coachman
admitted
us
to
a
hall
the
like
of
which
one
does
not
often
see
the
walls
were
panelled
with
dark
oak
up
to
the
gallery
that
ran
round
three
sides
of
it
the
balusters
of
the
wide
staircase
were
heavily
carved
and
blackened
portraits
of
flurry
ancestors
on
the
spindle
side
stared
sourly
down
on
their
descendant
as
he
tramped
upstairs
with
the
bog
mould
on
his
hobnailed
boots
we
had
just
changed
into
dry
clothes
when
robinson
crusoe
shoved
his
red
beard
round
the
corner
of
the
door
with
the
information
that
the
mistress
said
we
were
to
stay
for
dinner
my
heart
sank
it
was
then
barely
five
i
said
something
about
having
no
evening
clothes
and
having
to
get
home
early
sure
the
dinner
be
in
another
said
robinson
crusoe
joining
hospitably
in
the
conversation
and
as
for
evening
clothes
god
bless
ye
the
door
closed
behind
him
never
mind
said
flurry
i
dare
say
you
be
glad
enough
to
eat
another
dinner
by
the
time
you
get
home
he
laughed
poor
slipper
he
added
inconsequently
and
only
laughed
again
when
i
asked
for
an
explanation
old
knox
received
us
in
the
library
where
she
was
seated
by
a
roaring
turf
fire
which
lit
the
room
a
good
deal
more
effectively
than
the
pair
of
candles
that
stood
beside
her
in
tall
silver
candlesticks
ceaseless
and
implacable
growls
from
under
her
chair
indicated
the
presence
of
the
woolly
dog
she
talked
with
confounding
culture
of
the
books
that
rose
all
round
her
to
the
ceiling
her
evening
dress
was
accomplished
by
means
of
an
additional
white
shawl
rather
dirtier
than
its
congeners
as
i
took
her
in
to
dinner
she
quoted
virgil
to
me
and
in
the
same
breath
screeched
an
objurgation
at
a
being
whose
matted
head
rose
suddenly
into
view
from
behind
an
ancient
chinese
screen
as
i
have
seen
the
head
of
a
zulu
woman
peer
over
a
bush
dinner
was
as
incongruous
as
everything
else
detestable
soup
in
a
splendid
old
silver
tureen
that
was
nearly
as
dark
in
hue
as
robinson
crusoe
thumb
a
perfect
salmon
perfectly
cooked
on
a
chipped
kitchen
dish
such
cut
glass
as
is
not
easy
to
find
nowadays
sherry
that
as
flurry
subsequently
remarked
would
burn
the
shell
off
an
egg
and
a
bottle
of
port
draped
in
immemorial
cobwebs
wan
with
age
and
probably
priceless
throughout
the
vicissitudes
of
the
meal
knox
conversation
flowed
on
undismayed
directed
sometimes
at
me
she
had
installed
me
in
the
position
of
friend
of
her
youth
and
talked
to
me
as
if
i
were
my
own
grandfather
sometimes
at
crusoe
with
whom
she
had
several
heated
arguments
and
sometimes
she
would
make
a
statement
of
remarkable
frankness
on
the
subject
of
her
affairs
to
flurry
who
very
much
on
his
best
behaviour
agreed
with
all
she
said
and
risked
no
original
remark
as
i
listened
to
them
both
i
remembered
with
infinite
amusement
how
he
had
told
me
once
that
a
pet
name
she
had
for
him
was
lumpkin
and
no
one
but
herself
knew
what
she
meant
by
it
it
seemed
strange
that
she
made
no
allusion
to
trinket
colt
or
to
flurry
birthday
but
mindful
of
my
instructions
i
held
my
peace
as
at
about
eight
we
drove
away
in
the
moonlight
flurry
congratulated
me
solemnly
on
my
success
with
his
grandmother
he
was
good
enough
to
tell
me
that
she
would
marry
me
if
i
asked
her
and
he
wished
i
would
even
if
it
was
only
to
see
what
a
nice
grandson
he
be
for
me
a
sympathetic
giggle
behind
me
told
me
that
michael
on
the
back
seat
had
heard
and
relished
the
jest
we
had
left
the
gates
of
aussolas
about
half
a
mile
behind
when
at
the
corner
of
a
flurry
pulled
up
a
short
squat
figure
arose
from
the
black
shadow
of
a
furze
bush
and
came
out
into
the
moonlight
swinging
its
arms
like
a
cabman
and
cursing
audibly
oh
murdher
oh
murdher
misther
flurry
what
kept
ye
at
all
perish
the
crows
to
be
waiting
here
the
way
i
am
these
two
hours
ah
shut
your
mouth
slipper
said
flurry
who
to
my
surprise
had
turned
back
the
rug
and
was
taking
off
his
driving
coat
i
help
it
come
on
yeates
we
got
to
get
out
here
what
for
i
asked
in
not
unnatural
bewilderment
it
all
right
i
tell
you
as
we
go
along
replied
my
companion
who
was
already
turning
to
follow
slipper
up
the
take
the
trap
on
michael
and
wait
at
the
river
cross
he
waited
for
me
to
come
up
with
him
and
then
put
his
hand
on
my
arm
you
see
major
this
is
the
way
it
is
my
grandmother
given
me
that
colt
right
enough
but
if
i
waited
for
her
to
send
him
over
to
me
i
never
see
a
hair
of
his
tail
so
i
just
thought
that
as
we
were
over
here
we
might
as
well
take
him
back
with
us
and
maybe
you
give
us
a
help
with
him
he
not
be
altogether
too
handy
for
a
first
go
off
i
was
staggered
an
infant
in
arms
could
scarcely
have
failed
to
discern
the
fishiness
of
the
transaction
and
i
begged
knox
not
to
put
himself
to
this
trouble
on
my
account
as
i
had
no
doubt
i
could
find
a
horse
for
my
friend
elsewhere
knox
assured
me
that
it
was
no
trouble
at
all
quite
the
contrary
and
that
since
his
grandmother
had
given
him
the
colt
he
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
not
take
him
when
he
wanted
him
also
that
if
i
did
want
him
he
be
glad
enough
to
keep
him
himself
and
finally
that
i
was
the
chap
to
go
back
on
a
friend
but
i
was
welcome
to
drive
back
to
shreelane
with
michael
this
minute
if
i
liked
of
course
i
yielded
in
the
end
i
told
flurry
i
should
lose
my
job
over
the
business
and
he
said
i
could
then
marry
his
grandmother
and
the
discussion
was
abruptly
closed
by
the
necessity
of
following
slipper
over
a
locked
gate
our
pioneer
took
us
over
about
half
a
mile
of
country
knocking
down
stone
gaps
where
practicable
and
scrambling
over
tall
banks
in
the
deceptive
moonlight
we
found
ourselves
at
length
in
a
field
with
a
shed
in
one
corner
of
it
in
a
dim
group
of
farm
buildings
a
little
way
off
a
light
was
shining
wait
here
said
flurry
to
me
in
a
whisper
the
less
noise
the
better
it
an
open
shed
and
we
just
slip
in
and
coax
him
out
slipper
unwound
from
his
waist
a
halter
and
my
colleagues
glided
like
spectres
into
the
shadow
of
the
shed
leaving
me
to
meditate
on
my
duties
as
resident
magistrate
and
on
the
questions
that
would
be
asked
in
the
house
by
our
local
member
when
slipper
had
given
away
the
adventure
in
his
cups
in
less
than
a
minute
three
shadows
emerged
from
the
shed
where
two
had
gone
in
they
had
got
the
colt
he
came
out
as
quiet
as
a
calf
when
he
winded
the
sugar
said
flurry
it
was
well
for
me
i
filled
my
pockets
from
grandmamma
sugar
basin
he
and
slipper
had
a
rope
from
each
side
of
the
colt
head
they
took
him
quickly
across
a
field
towards
a
gate
the
colt
stepped
daintily
between
them
over
the
moonlit
grass
he
snorted
occasionally
but
appeared
on
the
whole
amenable
the
trouble
began
later
and
was
due
as
trouble
often
is
to
the
beguilements
of
a
short
cut
against
the
maturer
judgment
of
slipper
flurry
insisted
on
following
a
route
that
he
assured
us
he
knew
as
well
as
his
own
pocket
and
the
consequence
was
that
in
about
five
minutes
i
found
myself
standing
on
top
of
a
bank
hanging
on
to
a
rope
on
the
other
end
of
which
the
colt
dangled
and
danced
while
flurry
with
the
other
rope
lay
prone
in
the
ditch
and
slipper
administered
to
the
bewildered
colt
hindquarters
such
chastisement
as
could
be
ventured
on
i
have
no
space
to
narrate
in
detail
the
atrocious
difficulties
and
disasters
of
the
short
cut
how
the
colt
set
to
work
to
buck
and
went
away
across
a
field
dragging
the
faithful
slipper
literally
after
him
while
i
picked
myself
in
ignominy
out
of
a
briar
patch
and
flurry
cursed
himself
black
in
the
face
how
we
were
attacked
by
ferocious
cur
dogs
and
i
lost
my
eyeglass
and
how
as
we
neared
the
river
cross
flurry
espied
the
police
patrol
on
the
road
and
we
all
hid
behind
a
rick
of
turf
while
i
realised
in
fulness
what
an
exceptional
ass
i
was
to
have
been
beguiled
into
an
enterprise
that
involved
hiding
with
slipper
from
the
royal
irish
constabulary
let
it
suffice
to
say
that
trinket
infernal
offspring
was
finally
handed
over
on
the
to
michael
and
slipper
and
flurry
drove
me
home
in
a
state
of
mental
and
physical
overthrow
i
saw
nothing
of
my
friend
knox
for
the
next
couple
of
days
by
the
end
of
which
time
i
had
worked
up
a
high
polish
on
my
misgivings
and
had
determined
to
tell
him
that
under
no
circumstances
would
i
have
anything
to
say
to
his
grandmother
birthday
present
it
was
like
my
usual
luck
that
instead
of
writing
a
note
to
this
effect
i
thought
it
would
be
good
for
my
liver
to
walk
across
the
hills
to
tory
cottage
and
tell
flurry
so
in
person
it
was
a
bright
blustery
morning
after
a
muggy
day
the
feeling
of
spring
was
in
the
air
the
daffodils
were
already
in
bud
and
crocuses
showed
purple
in
the
grass
on
either
side
of
the
avenue
it
was
only
a
couple
of
miles
to
tory
cottage
by
the
way
across
the
hills
i
walked
fast
and
it
was
barely
twelve
when
i
saw
its
pink
walls
and
clumps
of
evergreens
below
me
as
i
looked
down
at
it
the
chiming
of
flurry
hounds
in
the
kennels
came
to
me
on
the
wind
i
stood
still
to
listen
and
could
almost
have
sworn
that
i
was
hearing
again
the
clash
of
magdalen
bells
hard
at
work
on
may
morning
the
path
that
i
was
following
led
downwards
through
a
larch
plantation
to
flurry
back
gate
hot
wafts
from
some
hideous
caldron
at
the
other
side
of
a
wall
apprised
me
of
the
vicinity
of
the
kennels
and
their
cuisine
and
the
round
were
hung
with
gruesome
and
unknown
joints
i
thanked
heaven
that
i
was
not
a
master
of
hounds
and
passed
on
as
quickly
as
might
be
to
the
hall
door
i
rang
two
or
three
times
without
response
then
the
door
opened
a
couple
of
inches
and
was
instantly
slammed
in
my
face
i
heard
the
hurried
paddling
of
bare
feet
on
oilcloth
and
a
voice
hurry
bridgie
hurry
there
quality
at
the
door
bridgie
holding
a
dirty
cap
on
with
one
hand
presently
arrived
and
informed
me
that
she
believed
knox
was
out
about
the
place
she
seemed
perturbed
and
she
cast
scared
glances
down
the
drive
while
speaking
to
me
i
knew
enough
of
flurry
habits
to
shape
a
tolerably
direct
course
for
his
whereabouts
he
was
as
i
had
expected
in
the
training
paddock
a
field
behind
the
in
which
he
had
put
up
practice
jumps
for
his
horses
it
was
a
field
with
clumps
of
furze
in
it
and
flurry
was
standing
near
one
of
these
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
singularly
unoccupied
i
supposed
that
he
was
prospecting
for
a
place
to
put
up
another
jump
he
did
not
see
me
coming
and
turned
with
a
start
as
i
spoke
to
him
there
was
a
queer
expression
of
mingled
guilt
and
what
i
can
only
describe
as
divilment
in
his
grey
eyes
as
he
greeted
me
in
my
dealings
with
flurry
knox
i
have
since
formed
the
habit
of
sitting
tight
in
a
general
way
when
i
see
that
expression
well
who
coming
next
i
wonder
he
said
as
he
shook
hands
with
me
it
not
ten
minutes
since
i
had
two
of
your
d
d
peelers
here
searching
the
whole
place
for
my
grandmother
colt
what
i
exclaimed
feeling
cold
all
down
my
back
do
you
mean
the
police
have
got
hold
of
it
they
have
got
hold
of
the
colt
anyway
said
flurry
looking
sideways
at
me
from
under
the
peak
of
his
cap
with
the
glint
of
the
sun
in
his
eye
i
got
word
in
time
before
they
came
what
do
you
mean
i
demanded
where
is
he
for
heaven
sake
tell
me
you
sent
the
brute
over
to
my
place
it
a
good
job
for
you
i
did
replied
flurry
as
the
police
are
on
their
way
to
shreelane
this
minute
to
consult
you
about
it
he
gave
utterance
to
one
of
his
short
diabolical
fits
of
laughter
he
where
they
not
find
him
anyhow
ho
ho
it
the
funniest
hand
i
ever
played
oh
yes
it
devilish
funny
i
no
doubt
i
retorted
beginning
to
lose
my
temper
as
is
the
manner
of
many
people
when
they
are
frightened
but
i
give
you
fair
warning
that
if
knox
asks
me
any
questions
about
it
i
shall
tell
her
the
whole
story
all
right
responded
flurry
and
when
you
do
do
forget
to
tell
her
how
you
flogged
the
colt
out
on
to
the
road
over
her
own
bounds
ditch
very
well
i
said
hotly
i
may
as
well
go
home
and
send
in
my
papers
they
break
me
over
this
ah
hold
on
major
said
flurry
soothingly
it
be
all
right
no
one
knows
anything
it
only
on
spec
the
old
lady
sent
the
bobbies
here
it
you
keep
quiet
it
all
blow
over
i
do
care
i
said
struggling
hopelessly
in
the
toils
if
i
meet
your
grandmother
and
she
asks
me
about
it
i
shall
tell
her
all
i
know
please
god
you
not
meet
her
after
all
it
not
once
in
a
blue
moon
that
she
began
flurry
even
as
he
said
the
words
his
face
changed
holy
fly
he
ejaculated
is
that
her
dog
coming
into
the
field
look
at
her
bonnet
over
the
wall
hide
hide
for
your
life
he
caught
me
by
the
shoulder
and
shoved
me
down
among
the
furze
bushes
before
i
realised
what
had
happened
get
in
there
i
talk
to
her
i
may
as
well
confess
that
at
the
mere
sight
of
knox
purple
bonnet
my
heart
had
turned
to
water
in
that
moment
i
knew
what
it
would
be
like
to
tell
her
how
i
having
eaten
her
salmon
and
capped
her
quotations
and
drunk
her
best
port
had
gone
forth
and
helped
to
steal
her
horse
i
abandoned
my
dignity
my
sense
of
honour
i
took
the
furze
prickles
to
my
breast
and
wallowed
in
them
knox
had
advanced
with
vengeful
speed
already
she
was
in
high
altercation
with
flurry
at
no
great
distance
from
where
i
lay
varying
sounds
of
battle
reached
me
and
i
gathered
that
flurry
was
not
to
put
it
mildly
shrinking
from
that
economy
of
truth
that
the
situation
required
is
it
that
curby
brute
you
promised
him
to
me
long
ago
but
i
would
be
bothered
with
him
the
old
lady
uttered
a
laugh
of
shrill
derision
is
it
likely
promise
you
my
best
colt
and
still
more
is
it
likely
that
refuse
him
if
i
did
very
well
flurry
voice
was
admirably
indignant
then
i
suppose
i
a
liar
and
a
thief
i
be
more
obliged
to
you
for
the
information
if
i
had
known
it
before
responded
his
grandmother
with
lightning
speed
if
you
swore
to
me
on
a
stack
of
bibles
you
knew
nothing
about
my
colt
i
believe
you
i
shall
go
straight
to
major
yeates
and
ask
his
advice
i
believe
to
be
a
gentleman
in
spite
of
the
company
he
keeps
i
writhed
deeper
into
the
furze
bushes
and
thereby
discovered
a
sandy
rabbit
run
along
which
i
crawled
with
my
cap
well
over
my
eyes
and
the
furze
needles
stabbing
me
through
my
stockings
the
ground
shelved
a
little
promising
profounder
concealment
but
the
bushes
were
very
thick
and
i
laid
hold
of
the
bare
stem
of
one
to
help
my
progress
it
lifted
out
of
the
ground
in
my
hand
revealing
a
stump
something
snorted
not
a
yard
away
i
glared
through
the
opening
and
was
confronted
by
the
long
horrified
face
of
knox
colt
mysteriously
on
a
level
with
my
own
even
without
the
white
diamond
on
his
forehead
i
should
have
divined
the
truth
but
how
in
the
name
of
wonder
had
flurry
persuaded
him
to
couch
like
a
woodcock
in
the
heart
of
a
furze
brake
for
a
full
minute
i
lay
as
still
as
death
for
fear
of
frightening
him
while
the
voices
of
flurry
and
his
grandmother
raged
on
alarmingly
close
to
me
the
colt
snorted
and
blew
long
breaths
through
his
wide
nostrils
but
he
did
not
move
i
crawled
an
inch
or
two
nearer
and
after
a
few
seconds
of
cautious
peering
i
grasped
the
position
they
had
buried
him
a
small
sandpit
among
the
furze
had
been
utilised
as
a
grave
they
had
filled
him
in
up
to
his
withers
with
sand
and
a
few
furze
bushes
artistically
disposed
round
the
pit
had
done
the
rest
as
the
depth
of
flurry
guile
was
revealed
laughter
came
upon
me
like
a
flood
i
gurgled
and
shook
apoplectically
and
the
colt
gazed
at
me
with
serious
surprise
until
a
sudden
outburst
of
barking
close
to
my
elbow
administered
a
fresh
shock
to
my
tottering
nerves
knox
woolly
dog
had
tracked
me
into
the
furze
and
was
now
baying
the
colt
and
me
with
mingled
terror
and
indignation
i
addressed
him
in
a
whisper
with
perfidious
endearments
advancing
a
crafty
hand
towards
him
the
while
made
a
snatch
for
the
back
of
his
neck
missed
it
badly
and
got
him
by
the
ragged
fleece
of
his
as
he
tried
to
flee
if
i
had
flayed
him
alive
he
could
hardly
have
uttered
a
more
deafening
series
of
yells
but
like
a
fool
instead
of
letting
him
go
i
dragged
him
towards
me
and
tried
to
stifle
the
noise
by
holding
his
muzzle
the
tussle
lasted
engrossingly
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
the
climax
of
the
nightmare
arrived
knox
voice
close
behind
me
said
let
go
my
dog
this
instant
sir
who
are
you
her
voice
faded
away
and
i
knew
that
she
also
had
seen
the
colt
head
i
positively
felt
sorry
for
her
at
her
age
there
was
no
knowing
what
effect
the
shock
might
have
on
her
i
scrambled
to
my
feet
and
confronted
her
major
yeates
she
said
there
was
a
deathly
pause
will
you
kindly
tell
me
said
knox
slowly
am
i
in
bedlam
or
are
you
and
is
she
pointed
to
the
colt
and
that
unfortunate
animal
recognising
the
voice
of
his
mistress
uttered
a
hoarse
and
lamentable
whinny
knox
felt
around
her
for
support
found
only
furze
prickles
gazed
speechlessly
at
me
and
then
to
her
eternal
honour
fell
into
wild
cackles
of
laughter
so
i
may
say
did
flurry
and
i
embarked
on
my
explanation
and
broke
down
flurry
followed
suit
and
broke
down
too
overwhelming
laughter
held
us
all
three
disintegrating
our
very
souls
knox
pulled
herself
together
first
i
acquit
you
major
yeates
i
acquit
you
though
appearances
are
against
you
it
clear
enough
to
me
you
fallen
among
thieves
she
stopped
and
glowered
at
flurry
her
purple
bonnet
was
over
one
eye
i
thank
you
sir
she
said
to
dig
out
that
horse
before
i
leave
this
place
and
when
you
dug
him
out
you
may
keep
him
be
no
receiver
of
stolen
goods
she
broke
off
and
shook
her
fist
at
him
upon
my
conscience
tony
i
give
a
guinea
to
have
thought
of
it
myself
iv
the
waters
of
strife
i
knew
bat
callaghan
face
long
before
i
was
able
to
put
a
name
to
it
there
was
seldom
a
court
day
in
skebawn
that
i
was
not
aware
of
his
level
brows
and
superfluously
intense
expression
somewhere
among
the
knot
of
who
patronised
the
weekly
sittings
of
the
bench
of
magistrates
his
social
position
appeared
to
fluctuate
i
have
seen
him
driving
a
car
he
sometimes
held
my
horse
for
me
that
is
to
say
he
sat
on
the
counter
of
a
while
the
quaker
slumbered
in
the
gutter
and
on
one
occasion
he
retired
at
my
bidding
to
cork
gaol
there
to
meditate
upon
the
inadvisability
of
defending
a
friend
from
the
attentions
of
the
police
with
the
tailboard
of
a
cart
he
next
obtained
prominence
in
my
regard
at
a
regatta
held
under
the
auspices
of
the
sons
of
liberty
a
local
football
club
that
justified
its
title
by
the
patriot
green
of
its
jerseys
and
its
free
interpretation
of
the
rules
of
the
game
the
announcement
of
my
name
on
the
posters
as
a
patron
a
privilege
acquired
at
the
cost
of
a
reluctant
made
it
incumbent
on
me
to
put
in
an
appearance
even
though
the
festival
coincided
with
my
petty
sessions
day
at
skebawn
and
at
some
five
of
the
clock
on
a
brilliant
september
afternoon
i
found
myself
driving
down
the
stony
road
that
dropped
in
zigzags
to
the
borders
of
the
lake
on
which
the
races
were
to
come
off
i
believe
that
the
selection
of
lough
lonen
as
the
scene
of
the
regatta
was
not
unconnected
with
the
fact
that
the
secretary
of
the
club
owned
a
at
the
cross
roads
at
one
end
of
it
none
the
less
the
president
of
the
royal
academy
could
scarcely
have
chosen
more
picturesque
surroundings
a
mountain
towered
steeply
up
from
the
lake
edge
dark
with
the
sad
green
of
in
september
fir
woods
followed
the
curve
of
the
shore
and
leaned
far
over
the
answering
darkness
of
the
water
and
above
the
trees
rose
the
toppling
steepnesses
of
the
hill
painted
with
a
purple
glow
of
heather
the
lake
was
about
a
mile
long
and
tumbling
from
its
farther
end
a
fierce
and
narrow
river
fled
away
west
to
the
sea
some
four
or
five
miles
off
i
had
not
seen
a
boat
race
since
i
was
at
oxford
and
the
words
still
called
up
before
my
eyes
a
vision
of
smart
parasols
of
gorgeous
barges
of
youths
and
of
low
slim
outriggers
winged
with
the
level
flight
of
oars
slitting
the
water
to
the
sway
of
the
line
of
flat
backs
certainly
possibilities
in
aquatics
were
revealed
to
me
as
i
reined
in
the
quaker
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
and
saw
below
me
the
festival
of
the
sons
of
liberty
in
full
swing
boats
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
outrageously
overladen
moved
about
the
lake
with
oars
flourishing
to
the
strains
of
concertinas
black
swarms
of
people
seethed
along
the
water
edge
congesting
here
and
there
round
the
dingy
tents
and
stalls
of
green
apples
and
the
celebrated
brass
band
enthroned
in
a
wagonette
and
stimulated
by
the
presence
of
a
barrel
of
porter
on
the
was
belching
forth
the
boys
of
wexford
under
the
guidance
of
a
disreputable
drummer
in
a
series
of
crashing
discords
almost
as
i
arrived
a
set
the
echoes
clattering
round
the
lake
and
three
boats
burst
out
abreast
from
the
throng
into
the
open
water
two
of
the
crews
were
in
the
third
wore
the
green
jerseys
of
the
football
club
the
boats
were
of
the
heavy
build
and
pulled
six
oars
apiece
oars
of
which
the
looms
were
scarcely
narrower
than
the
blades
and
were
of
the
two
but
a
shade
heavier
none
the
less
the
rowers
started
dauntlessly
at
strokes
a
minute
quickening
up
incredible
as
it
may
seem
as
they
rounded
the
mark
boat
in
the
first
lap
of
the
course
the
rowing
was
in
general
style
more
akin
to
the
action
of
beating
up
eggs
with
a
fork
than
to
any
other
form
of
athletic
exercise
but
in
its
unorthodox
way
it
kicked
the
heavy
boats
along
at
a
surprising
pace
the
oars
squeaked
and
grunted
against
the
the
coxswains
kept
up
an
unceasing
flow
of
oratory
and
superfluous
little
boys
in
punts
contrived
to
intervene
at
all
the
more
critical
of
the
race
only
evading
the
flail
of
the
oncoming
oars
by
performing
prodigies
of
waggling
with
a
single
oar
at
the
stern
i
took
out
my
watch
and
counted
the
strokes
when
they
were
passing
the
mark
boat
for
the
second
time
they
were
pulling
a
fraction
over
forty
one
of
the
crews
was
obviously
in
trouble
the
other
with
humped
backs
and
jerking
oars
was
holding
its
own
against
the
green
jerseys
amid
the
blended
yells
of
friends
and
foes
when
for
the
last
time
they
rounded
the
green
flag
there
were
but
two
boats
in
the
race
and
the
foul
that
had
been
imminent
throughout
was
at
length
achieved
with
a
rattle
of
oars
and
a
storm
of
curses
they
were
clear
again
in
a
moment
the
crew
getting
away
with
a
distinct
lead
and
it
was
at
about
this
juncture
that
i
became
aware
that
the
coxswains
had
abandoned
their
tillers
and
were
standing
over
their
respective
strokes
shoving
frantically
at
their
oars
and
maintaining
the
while
a
ceaseless
bawl
of
encouragement
and
defiance
it
looked
like
a
foregone
conclusion
for
the
leaders
and
the
war
of
cheers
rose
to
frenzy
the
word
cheering
indeed
is
but
an
euphuism
and
in
no
way
expresses
the
serrated
yell
composed
of
epithets
advice
and
imprecations
that
was
flung
like
a
live
thing
at
the
oncoming
boats
the
green
jerseys
answered
to
this
stimulant
with
a
wild
spurt
that
drove
the
bow
of
their
boat
within
a
measurable
distance
of
their
opponents
stroke
oar
in
another
second
a
thoroughly
successful
foul
would
have
been
effected
but
the
cox
of
the
leading
boat
proved
himself
equal
to
the
emergency
by
unshipping
his
tiller
and
with
it
dealing
bow
of
the
green
jerseys
such
a
blow
over
the
head
as
effectually
dismissed
him
from
the
sphere
of
practical
politics
a
great
roar
of
laughter
greeted
this
feat
of
arms
and
a
voice
at
my
dogcart
wheel
pierced
the
clamour
more
power
to
ye
larry
me
owld
darlin
i
looked
down
and
saw
bat
callaghan
with
shining
eyes
and
a
face
white
with
excitement
poising
himself
on
one
foot
on
the
box
of
my
wheel
in
order
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
race
almost
before
i
had
time
to
recognise
him
a
man
in
a
green
jersey
caught
him
round
the
legs
and
jerked
him
down
callaghan
fell
into
the
throng
recovered
himself
in
an
instant
and
rushed
white
and
dangerous
at
his
assailant
the
son
of
liberty
was
no
less
ready
for
the
fray
and
what
is
known
in
ireland
as
the
father
and
mother
of
a
row
was
imminent
already
however
one
of
those
unequalled
judges
of
the
moral
temperature
of
a
crowd
a
sergeant
of
the
had
quietly
interposed
his
bulky
person
between
the
combatants
and
the
coming
trouble
was
averted
elsewhere
battle
was
raging
the
race
was
over
and
the
committee
boat
was
hemmed
in
by
the
rival
crews
supplemented
by
craft
of
all
kinds
the
objection
was
being
lodged
and
in
its
turn
objected
to
and
i
can
only
liken
the
process
to
the
screaming
warfare
of
seagulls
round
a
piece
of
carrion
the
tumult
was
still
at
its
height
when
out
of
its
very
heart
two
boats
broke
forth
and
a
pistol
shot
proclaimed
that
another
race
had
begun
the
public
interest
in
which
was
specially
keen
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
rowers
were
stalwart
country
girls
who
made
up
in
energy
what
they
lacked
in
skill
it
was
a
short
race
once
round
the
mark
boat
only
and
like
a
successful
farce
it
went
with
a
roar
from
start
to
finish
foul
after
foul
each
followed
by
a
healing
interval
of
calm
during
which
the
crews
who
had
all
caught
crabs
were
recovering
themselves
and
their
oars
marked
its
progress
and
when
the
two
boats
locked
in
an
inextricable
embrace
at
length
passed
the
winning
flag
and
the
crews
oblivious
of
judges
and
public
fell
to
untrammelled
personal
abuse
and
to
doing
up
their
hair
i
decided
that
i
had
seen
the
best
of
the
fun
and
prepared
to
go
home
it
was
as
it
happened
the
last
race
of
the
day
and
nothing
remained
in
the
way
of
excitement
save
the
greased
pole
with
the
pig
slung
in
a
bag
at
the
end
of
it
my
final
impression
of
the
lough
lonen
regatta
was
of
callaghan
lithe
figure
sleek
and
dripping
against
the
yellow
sky
as
he
poised
on
the
swaying
pole
with
the
broken
gold
of
the
water
beneath
him
limited
as
was
my
experience
of
the
southwest
of
ireland
i
was
in
no
way
surprised
to
hear
on
the
following
afternoon
from
peter
cadogan
that
there
had
been
sthrokes
the
night
before
when
the
boys
were
going
home
from
the
regatta
and
that
the
police
were
searching
for
one
jimmy
foley
what
do
they
want
him
for
i
asked
sure
it
according
as
a
man
that
was
bringing
a
car
of
bogwood
was
tellin
me
sir
answered
peter
pursuing
his
occupation
of
washing
the
dogcart
with
unabated
industry
they
say
jimmy
wife
went
roaring
to
the
police
saying
she
could
get
no
account
of
her
husband
i
suppose
he
beaten
some
fellow
and
is
hiding
i
suggested
well
that
might
be
sir
asserted
peter
respectfully
he
plied
his
mop
vigorously
in
intricate
places
about
the
springs
which
would
i
knew
have
never
been
explored
save
for
my
presence
it
what
john
hennessy
was
saying
that
he
was
hard
set
to
get
his
horse
past
cluin
cross
the
way
the
blood
was
sthrewn
about
the
road
resumed
peter
sure
they
were
fighting
like
wasps
in
it
half
the
night
who
were
fighting
i
could
say
indeed
sir
some
o
thim
low
rakish
lads
from
the
town
i
suppose
replied
peter
with
virtuous
respectability
when
peter
cadogan
was
quietly
and
intelligently
candid
to
pursue
an
inquiry
was
seldom
of
much
avail
next
day
in
skebawn
i
met
little
murray
the
district
inspector
very
alert
and
smart
in
his
uniform
going
forth
to
collect
evidence
about
the
fight
he
told
me
that
the
police
were
pretty
certain
that
one
of
the
sons
of
liberty
named
foley
had
been
murdered
but
as
usual
the
difficulty
was
to
get
any
one
to
give
information
all
that
was
known
was
that
he
was
gone
and
that
his
wife
had
identified
his
cap
which
had
been
found
drenched
with
blood
by
the
roadside
murray
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
whole
business
had
arisen
out
of
the
row
over
the
disputed
race
and
that
there
must
have
been
a
dozen
people
looking
on
when
the
murder
was
done
but
so
far
no
evidence
was
forthcoming
and
after
a
day
and
a
night
of
search
the
police
had
not
been
able
to
find
the
body
no
said
flurry
knox
who
had
joined
us
and
if
it
was
any
of
those
mountainy
men
did
away
with
him
you
might
scrape
ireland
with
a
comb
and
you
not
get
him
that
evening
i
smoked
an
cigarette
out
of
doors
in
the
mild
starlight
strolling
about
the
rudimentary
paths
of
what
would
i
hoped
some
day
be
philippa
garden
the
bats
came
stooping
at
the
red
end
of
my
cigarette
and
from
the
covert
behind
the
house
i
heard
once
or
twice
the
delicate
bark
of
a
fox
civilisation
seemed
a
thousand
miles
off
as
far
away
as
the
falling
star
that
had
just
drawn
a
line
of
pale
fire
down
the
northern
sky
i
had
been
nearly
a
year
at
shreelane
house
by
myself
now
and
the
time
seemed
very
long
to
me
it
was
slow
work
putting
by
money
even
under
the
austerities
of
cadogan
and
though
i
had
warned
philippa
i
meant
to
marry
her
after
christmas
there
were
moments
and
this
was
one
of
them
when
it
seemed
an
idle
threat
pether
the
strident
voice
of
cadogan
intruded
upon
my
meditations
go
tell
the
major
his
coffee
is
waitin
on
him
i
went
gloomily
into
the
house
and
with
a
resignation
born
of
adversity
swallowed
the
mixture
of
chicory
and
liquorice
which
my
housekeeper
possessed
the
secret
of
distilling
from
the
best
and
most
expensive
coffee
my
theory
about
it
was
that
it
added
to
the
illusion
that
i
had
dined
and
moreover
that
it
kept
me
awake
and
i
generally
had
a
good
deal
of
writing
to
do
after
dinner
having
swallowed
it
i
went
downstairs
and
out
past
the
kitchen
regions
to
my
office
a
hideous
whitewashed
room
in
which
i
interviewed
policemen
and
took
affidavits
and
did
most
of
my
official
writing
it
had
a
door
that
opened
into
the
yard
and
a
window
that
looked
out
in
the
other
direction
among
lanky
laurels
and
scrubby
hollies
where
lay
the
cats
main
thoroughfare
from
the
scullery
window
to
the
rabbit
holes
in
the
wood
i
had
a
good
deal
of
work
to
do
and
the
time
passed
quickly
it
was
friday
night
and
from
the
kitchen
at
the
end
of
the
passage
came
the
gabbling
murmur
in
two
alternate
keys
that
i
had
learned
to
recognise
as
the
recital
of
a
litany
by
my
housekeeper
and
her
nephew
peter
this
performance
was
followed
by
some
of
those
dreary
and
yawns
that
are
i
think
peculiar
to
irish
kitchens
then
such
of
the
cats
as
had
returned
from
the
chase
were
loudly
shepherded
into
the
back
scullery
the
kitchen
door
shut
with
a
slam
and
my
retainers
retired
to
repose
it
was
nearly
afterwards
when
i
finished
the
notes
i
had
been
making
on
an
adjourned
case
of
salmon
in
the
lonen
river
i
leaned
back
in
my
chair
and
lighted
a
cigarette
preparatory
to
turning
in
my
thoughts
had
again
wandered
on
a
sentimental
journey
across
the
irish
channel
when
i
heard
a
slight
stir
of
some
kind
outside
the
open
window
in
the
wilds
of
ireland
no
one
troubles
themselves
about
burglars
more
cats
i
thought
i
must
shut
the
window
before
i
go
to
bed
almost
immediately
there
followed
a
faint
tap
on
the
window
and
then
a
voice
said
in
a
hoarse
and
hurried
whisper
them
that
wants
jim
foley
let
them
look
in
the
river
if
i
had
kept
my
head
i
should
have
sat
still
and
encouraged
a
further
confidence
but
unfortunately
i
acted
on
the
impulse
of
the
natural
man
and
was
at
the
window
in
a
jump
knocking
down
my
chair
and
making
noise
enough
to
scare
a
far
less
shy
bird
than
an
irish
informer
of
course
there
was
no
one
there
i
listened
with
every
nerve
as
taut
as
a
violin
string
it
was
quite
dark
there
was
just
breeze
enough
to
make
a
rustling
in
the
evergreens
so
that
a
man
might
brush
through
them
without
being
heard
and
while
i
debated
on
a
plan
of
action
there
came
from
beyond
the
shrubbery
the
jar
and
twang
of
a
loose
strand
of
wire
in
the
paling
by
the
wood
my
informant
whoever
he
might
be
had
vanished
into
the
darkness
from
which
he
had
come
as
irrecoverably
as
had
the
falling
star
that
had
written
its
brief
message
across
the
sky
and
gone
out
again
into
infinity
i
got
up
very
early
next
morning
and
drove
to
skebawn
to
see
murray
and
offer
him
my
mysterious
information
for
what
it
was
worth
personally
i
did
not
think
it
worth
much
and
was
disposed
to
regard
it
as
a
red
herring
drawn
across
the
trail
murray
however
was
not
in
a
mood
to
despise
anything
that
had
a
suggestion
to
make
having
been
out
till
nine
the
night
before
without
being
able
to
find
any
clue
to
the
of
james
foley
the
river
a
good
mile
from
the
place
where
the
fight
was
he
said
straddling
his
compasses
over
the
ordnance
survey
map
and
there
no
sort
of
a
road
they
could
have
taken
him
along
but
a
tip
like
this
is
always
worth
trying
i
remember
in
the
land
league
time
how
a
man
came
one
saturday
night
to
my
window
and
told
me
there
were
holes
drilled
in
the
chapel
door
to
shoot
a
boycotted
man
through
while
he
was
at
mass
the
holes
were
there
right
enough
and
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
chap
found
excellent
reasons
for
having
family
prayers
at
home
next
day
i
had
sessions
to
attend
on
the
extreme
outskirts
of
my
district
and
could
not
wait
as
murray
suggested
to
see
the
thing
out
i
did
not
get
home
till
the
following
day
and
when
i
arrived
i
found
a
letter
from
murray
awaiting
me
your
pal
was
right
we
found
foley
body
in
the
river
knocking
about
against
the
posts
of
the
weir
the
head
was
wrapped
in
his
own
green
jersey
and
had
been
smashed
in
by
a
stone
we
suspect
a
fellow
named
bat
callaghan
who
has
bolted
but
there
were
a
lot
of
them
in
it
possibly
it
was
callaghan
himself
who
gave
you
the
tip
you
never
can
tell
how
superstition
is
going
to
take
them
next
the
inquest
will
be
held
the
coroner
jury
took
a
cautious
view
of
the
cause
of
the
catastrophe
and
brought
in
a
verdict
of
death
by
misadventure
and
i
presently
found
it
to
be
my
duty
to
call
a
magisterial
inquiry
to
further
investigate
the
matter
a
few
days
before
this
was
to
take
place
i
was
engaged
in
the
delicate
task
of
displaying
to
my
landlord
mr
flurry
knox
the
defects
of
the
pantry
sink
when
cadogan
advanced
upon
us
with
the
information
that
the
widow
callaghan
from
cluin
would
be
thankful
to
speak
to
me
and
had
brought
me
a
present
of
a
fine
young
goose
is
she
come
over
here
looking
for
bat
said
flurry
withdrawing
his
arm
and
the
longest
from
the
pipe
that
he
had
been
probing
she
knows
you
handy
at
hiding
your
friends
mary
maybe
it
he
that
stopping
the
drain
cadogan
turned
her
large
red
face
upon
her
late
employer
god
knows
i
wish
yerself
was
stuck
in
it
master
flurry
the
way
hear
pether
cursin
the
full
o
the
house
when
he
striving
to
wash
the
things
in
that
unnatural
little
trough
are
you
sure
it
peter
does
all
the
cursing
retorted
flurry
i
hear
father
scanlan
has
it
in
for
you
this
long
time
for
not
going
to
confession
and
how
can
i
walk
two
miles
to
the
chapel
with
god
burden
on
me
feet
demanded
cadogan
in
purple
indignation
the
blessed
virgin
and
docthor
hickey
knows
well
the
hardship
i
gets
from
them
if
it
was
for
a
pair
of
the
major
boots
he
gave
me
i
be
hard
set
to
thravel
the
house
itself
the
contest
might
have
been
continued
indefinitely
had
i
not
struck
up
the
swords
with
a
request
that
callaghan
might
be
sent
round
to
the
hall
door
there
we
found
a
tall
countrywoman
waiting
for
us
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
in
the
hooded
blue
cloak
that
is
peculiar
to
the
south
of
ireland
from
the
fact
that
she
clutched
a
in
her
right
hand
i
augured
a
stormy
interview
but
nothing
could
have
been
more
and
even
imposing
than
the
reverence
with
which
she
greeted
flurry
and
me
to
your
honours
she
began
with
a
dignified
and
extremely
imminent
snuffle
i
ask
your
pardon
for
troubling
you
major
yeates
but
i
have
a
one
in
the
counthry
to
give
me
an
adwice
and
i
have
no
confidence
only
in
your
honour
experiments
experience
she
means
prompted
flurry
did
you
get
advice
enough
out
of
murray
yesterday
he
went
on
aloud
i
heard
he
was
at
cluin
to
see
you
and
if
he
was
itself
it
little
adwantage
any
one
get
out
of
that
little
of
a
responded
callaghan
tartly
he
was
with
me
for
a
giving
me
every
big
rock
of
english
till
i
had
a
reel
in
me
head
i
declare
to
ye
mr
flurry
after
he
had
gone
out
o
the
house
ye
would
throw
three
farthings
for
me
the
was
here
utilised
after
which
with
a
heavy
groan
callaghan
again
took
up
her
parable
i
towld
him
first
and
last
i
lose
me
life
if
i
had
to
go
into
the
coort
and
if
i
did
itself
sure
th
attorneys
could
rip
no
more
out
me
than
what
he
did
himself
did
you
tell
him
where
was
bat
inquired
flurry
casually
at
this
callaghan
immediately
dissolved
into
tears
is
it
bat
she
howled
if
the
twelve
apostles
came
down
from
heaven
asking
me
where
was
bat
i
could
give
them
no
satisfaction
the
divil
a
know
i
know
what
happened
him
he
came
home
with
me
sober
and
from
the
rogatta
and
the
next
morning
he
axed
a
fresh
egg
for
his
breakfast
and
god
forgive
me
i
would
break
the
score
i
was
taking
to
the
hotel
and
with
that
he
slapped
the
cup
o
tay
into
the
fire
and
went
out
the
door
and
i
never
got
a
word
of
him
since
good
nor
bad
god
knows
is
i
got
throuble
with
that
poor
boy
and
he
the
only
one
i
have
to
look
to
in
the
world
i
cut
the
matter
short
by
asking
her
what
she
wanted
me
to
do
for
her
and
sifted
out
from
amongst
much
extraneous
detail
the
fact
that
she
relied
upon
my
renowned
wisdom
and
clemency
to
preserve
her
from
being
called
as
a
witness
at
the
coming
inquiry
the
gift
of
the
goose
served
its
intended
purpose
of
embarrassing
my
position
but
in
spite
of
it
i
broke
to
the
widow
callaghan
my
inability
to
help
her
she
did
not
of
course
believe
me
but
she
was
too
to
say
so
in
ireland
one
becomes
accustomed
to
this
attitude
as
it
turned
out
however
bat
callaghan
mother
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
inquiry
she
was
by
turns
deaf
imbecile
garrulously
candid
and
furiously
abusive
of
murray
principal
witness
a
frightened
lad
of
seventeen
who
had
sworn
to
having
seen
bat
callaghan
and
jimmy
foley
shaping
at
one
another
to
fight
at
an
hour
when
according
to
callaghan
bat
was
lying
sthretched
on
the
beddeen
with
a
sick
shtomach
in
consequence
of
the
malignant
character
of
the
porter
supplied
by
the
last
witness
father
it
all
ended
as
such
cases
so
often
do
in
ireland
in
complete
moral
certainty
in
the
minds
of
all
concerned
as
to
the
guilt
of
the
accused
and
entire
impotence
on
the
part
of
the
law
to
prove
it
a
warrant
was
issued
for
the
arrest
of
bartholomew
callaghan
and
the
clans
of
callaghan
and
foley
fought
rather
more
bloodily
than
usual
as
occasion
served
and
at
intervals
during
the
next
few
months
murray
used
to
ask
me
if
my
friend
the
murderer
had
dropped
in
lately
to
which
i
was
wont
to
reply
with
condolences
on
the
failure
of
the
to
find
the
widow
only
son
for
her
and
that
was
about
all
that
came
of
it
events
with
which
the
present
story
has
no
concern
took
me
to
england
towards
the
end
of
the
following
march
it
so
happened
that
my
old
regiment
the
th
fusiliers
was
quartered
at
whincastle
within
a
couple
of
hours
by
rail
of
philippa
home
where
i
was
staying
and
since
my
wedding
was
now
within
measurable
distance
my
former
invited
me
over
to
dine
and
sleep
and
to
receive
a
valedictory
silver
claret
jug
that
they
were
magnanimous
enough
to
bestow
upon
a
backslider
i
enjoyed
the
dinner
as
much
as
any
man
can
enjoy
his
dinner
when
he
knows
he
has
to
make
a
speech
at
the
end
of
it
through
much
and
varied
conversation
i
strove
like
a
nervous
mother
who
can
not
trust
her
offspring
out
of
her
sight
to
keep
before
my
mind
eye
the
opening
sentences
that
i
had
composed
in
the
train
i
felt
that
if
i
could
only
get
away
satisfactorily
i
might
trust
the
ayala
to
do
the
rest
and
of
that
fount
of
inspiration
there
was
no
lack
as
it
turned
out
i
got
away
all
right
though
the
sight
of
the
double
line
of
expectant
faces
and
red
mess
jackets
nearly
scattered
those
precious
opening
sentences
and
i
am
afraid
that
so
far
as
the
various
subsequent
points
went
that
i
had
intended
to
make
i
stayed
away
however
neither
demosthenes
nor
a
nationalist
member
at
a
cork
election
could
have
been
listened
to
with
more
gratifying
attention
and
i
sat
down
hot
and
happy
to
be
confronted
with
my
own
flushed
visage
hideously
reflected
in
the
glittering
paunch
of
the
claret
jug
once
safely
over
the
presentation
the
evening
mellowed
into
frivolity
and
it
was
pretty
late
before
i
found
myself
settled
down
to
whist
at
sixpenny
points
in
the
ancient
familiar
way
while
most
of
the
others
fell
to
playing
pool
in
the
next
door
i
have
played
whist
from
my
youth
up
with
the
preternatural
seriousness
of
a
subaltern
with
the
of
a
senior
captain
with
the
privileged
irascibility
of
a
major
and
my
eighteen
months
of
abstinence
at
shreelane
had
only
whetted
my
appetite
for
what
i
consider
the
best
of
games
after
the
long
lonely
evenings
there
with
rats
for
company
and
for
relaxation
a
deck
of
that
specially
demoniacal
american
variety
of
patience
known
as
fooly
ann
it
was
wondrous
agreeable
to
sit
again
among
my
fellows
and
lay
the
longs
on
a
severely
scientific
rubber
of
whist
as
though
cadogan
and
the
skebawn
bench
of
magistrates
had
never
existed
we
were
in
the
first
game
of
the
second
rubber
and
i
was
holding
a
very
nice
playing
hand
i
had
early
in
the
game
moved
forth
my
trumps
to
battle
and
i
was
now
in
the
ineffable
position
of
scoring
with
the
small
cards
of
my
long
suit
the
cards
fell
and
fell
in
silence
and
ballantyne
my
partner
raked
in
the
tricks
like
a
machine
the
concentrated
quiet
of
the
game
was
suddenly
arrested
by
a
sharp
unmistakable
sound
from
the
barrack
yard
outside
the
snap
of
a
rifle
what
was
that
exclaimed
moffat
the
senior
major
before
he
had
finished
speaking
there
was
a
second
shot
by
jove
those
were
perhaps
i
better
go
and
see
up
said
ballantyne
who
was
captain
of
the
week
throwing
down
his
cards
and
making
a
bolt
for
the
door
he
had
hardly
got
out
of
the
room
when
the
first
long
high
note
of
the
assembly
sang
out
sudden
and
clear
we
all
sprang
to
our
feet
and
as
the
went
shrilly
on
the
other
men
came
pouring
in
from
the
and
stampeded
to
their
quarters
to
get
their
swords
at
the
same
moment
the
mess
sergeant
appeared
at
the
outer
door
with
a
face
as
white
as
his
the
sentry
on
the
magazine
guard
has
been
shot
sir
he
said
excitedly
to
moffat
they
say
he
dead
we
were
all
out
in
the
barrack
square
in
an
instant
it
was
clear
moonlight
and
the
square
was
already
alive
with
hurrying
figures
cramming
on
clothes
and
caps
as
they
ran
to
fall
in
i
was
a
free
agent
these
times
and
i
followed
the
mess
sergeant
across
the
square
towards
the
distant
corner
where
the
magazine
stands
as
we
doubled
round
the
end
of
the
men
quarters
we
nearly
ran
into
a
small
party
of
men
who
were
advancing
slowly
and
heavily
in
our
direction
he
is
sir
said
the
mess
sergeant
stopping
himself
abruptly
they
were
carrying
the
sentry
to
the
hospital
his
busby
had
fallen
off
the
moon
shone
mildly
on
his
pale
convulsed
face
and
foam
and
strange
inhuman
sounds
came
from
his
lips
his
head
was
rolling
from
side
to
side
on
the
arm
of
one
of
the
men
who
was
carrying
him
as
it
turned
towards
me
i
was
struck
by
something
disturbingly
familiar
in
the
face
and
i
wondered
if
he
had
been
in
my
old
company
what
his
name
sergeant
i
said
to
the
mess
sergeant
private
harris
sir
replied
the
sergeant
he
only
lately
come
up
from
the
depôt
and
this
was
his
first
time
on
sentry
by
himself
i
went
back
to
the
mess
and
in
process
of
time
the
others
straggled
in
thirsting
for
and
full
of
such
information
as
there
was
to
give
private
harris
was
not
wounded
both
the
shots
had
been
fired
by
him
as
was
testified
by
the
state
of
his
rifle
and
the
fact
that
two
of
the
cartridges
were
missing
from
the
packet
in
his
pouch
i
hear
he
was
a
queer
sulky
sort
of
chap
always
said
tomkinson
the
subaltern
of
the
day
but
if
he
was
having
a
try
at
suicide
he
made
a
bally
bad
fist
of
it
he
made
as
good
a
fist
of
it
as
you
did
of
putting
on
your
sword
tommy
remarked
ballantyne
indicating
a
dangling
white
strap
of
webbing
that
hung
down
like
a
tail
below
tomkinson
mess
jacket
nerves
obviously
in
both
cases
the
exquisite
satisfaction
afforded
by
this
discovery
to
tomkinson
brother
officers
found
its
natural
outlet
in
a
bear
fight
that
threatened
to
become
more
or
less
general
and
in
the
course
of
which
i
slid
away
unostentatiously
to
bed
in
ballantyne
quarters
and
took
the
precaution
of
barricading
my
door
next
morning
when
i
got
down
to
breakfast
i
found
ballantyne
and
two
or
three
others
in
the
mess
room
and
my
first
inquiry
was
for
private
harris
oh
the
poor
chap
dead
said
ballantyne
it
a
very
queer
business
altogether
i
think
he
must
have
been
wrong
in
the
top
storey
the
doctor
was
with
him
when
he
came
to
out
of
the
fit
or
whatever
it
was
and
that
the
doctor
y
know
irish
of
course
and
by
the
way
poor
harris
was
an
irishman
too
says
that
he
could
only
jibber
at
first
but
then
he
got
better
and
he
got
out
of
him
that
when
he
had
been
on
for
about
he
happened
to
look
up
at
the
angle
of
the
barrack
wall
near
where
it
joins
the
magazine
tower
and
saw
a
face
looking
at
him
over
it
he
challenged
and
got
no
answer
but
the
face
just
stuck
there
staring
at
him
he
challenged
again
and
then
as
said
he
oop
with
his
royfle
and
blazed
at
it
ballantyne
was
not
above
the
common
english
delusion
that
he
could
imitate
an
irish
brogue
well
what
happened
then
well
according
to
the
poor
devil
own
story
the
face
just
kept
on
looking
at
him
and
he
had
another
shot
at
it
and
god
almighty
he
said
to
was
there
always
while
he
was
saying
that
to
he
began
to
chuck
another
fit
and
apparently
went
on
chucking
them
till
he
died
a
couple
of
hours
ago
one
result
of
it
is
said
another
man
that
they
could
get
a
man
to
go
on
sentry
there
alone
last
night
i
expect
we
shall
have
to
double
the
sentries
there
every
night
as
long
as
we
here
silly
asses
remarked
tomkinson
but
he
said
it
without
conviction
after
breakfast
we
went
out
to
look
at
the
wall
by
the
magazine
it
was
about
eleven
feet
high
with
a
coped
top
and
they
told
me
there
was
a
deep
and
wide
dry
ditch
on
the
outside
a
ladder
was
brought
and
we
examined
the
angle
of
the
wall
at
which
harris
said
the
face
had
appeared
he
had
made
a
beautiful
shot
one
of
his
bullets
having
flicked
a
piece
off
the
ridge
of
the
coping
exactly
at
the
corner
it
not
the
kind
of
shot
a
man
would
make
if
he
had
been
drinking
said
moffat
regretfully
abandoning
his
first
simple
hypothesis
he
must
have
been
mad
i
wish
i
could
find
out
who
his
people
are
said
brownlow
the
adjutant
who
had
joined
us
they
found
in
his
box
a
letter
to
him
from
his
mother
but
we
ca
make
out
the
name
of
the
place
by
jove
yeates
you
an
irishman
perhaps
you
can
help
us
he
handed
me
a
letter
in
a
dirty
envelope
there
was
no
address
given
the
contents
were
very
short
and
i
may
be
forgiven
if
i
transcribe
them
my
dear
son
i
hope
you
are
well
as
this
leaves
me
at
present
thanks
be
to
god
for
it
i
am
very
much
unaisy
about
the
cow
she
swelled
up
this
morning
she
ran
in
and
was
frauding
and
i
did
not
do
but
to
run
up
for
torn
sweeney
in
the
minute
we
are
thinking
it
is
too
much
lairels
or
an
eirub
she
took
i
do
not
know
what
i
will
do
with
her
god
help
one
that
alone
with
himself
i
had
not
a
days
luck
since
ye
went
away
i
am
thinkin
them
that
wants
ye
is
tired
lookin
for
ye
and
so
i
remain
your
fond
mother
well
you
do
get
much
of
a
lead
from
the
cow
do
you
and
what
the
deuce
is
an
eirub
said
brownlow
it
another
way
of
spelling
herb
i
said
turning
over
the
envelope
abstractedly
the
postmark
was
almost
obliterated
but
it
struck
me
it
might
be
construed
into
the
word
skebawn
look
here
i
said
suddenly
let
me
see
harris
it
just
possible
i
may
know
something
about
him
the
sentry
body
had
been
laid
in
the
near
the
hospital
and
brownlow
fetched
the
key
it
was
a
grim
little
whitewashed
building
without
windows
save
a
small
one
of
lancet
shape
high
up
in
one
gable
through
which
a
streak
of
april
sunlight
fell
sharp
and
slender
on
the
whitewashed
wall
the
long
figure
of
the
sentry
lay
sheeted
on
a
stone
slab
and
brownlow
with
his
cap
in
his
hand
gently
uncovered
the
face
i
leaned
over
and
looked
at
it
at
the
heavy
brows
the
short
nose
the
small
moustache
lying
black
above
the
pale
mouth
the
eyes
sealed
in
appalling
peacefulness
there
rose
before
me
the
wild
dark
face
of
the
young
man
who
had
hung
on
my
wheel
and
yelled
encouragement
to
the
winning
coxswain
at
the
lough
lonen
regatta
i
know
him
i
said
his
name
is
callaghan
v
lisheen
races
it
may
or
may
not
be
agreeable
to
have
attained
the
age
of
but
judging
from
old
photographs
the
privilege
of
being
nineteen
has
also
its
drawbacks
i
turned
over
page
after
page
of
an
ancient
book
in
which
were
enshrined
portraits
of
the
friends
of
my
youth
singly
in
david
and
jonathan
couples
and
in
groups
in
which
i
as
it
seemed
to
my
mature
and
possibly
jaundiced
perception
always
contrived
to
look
the
most
immeasurable
young
bounder
of
the
lot
our
faces
were
fat
and
yet
i
can
not
remember
ever
having
been
considered
fat
in
my
life
we
indulged
in
shirts
in
jemima
ties
with
diagonal
stripes
we
wore
coats
that
seemed
three
sizes
too
small
and
trousers
that
were
three
sizes
too
big
we
also
wore
small
whiskers
i
stopped
at
last
at
one
of
the
david
and
jonathan
memorial
portraits
yes
here
was
the
object
of
my
researches
this
stout
and
earnestly
romantic
youth
was
leigh
kelway
and
that
fatuous
and
chubby
young
person
seated
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
was
myself
leigh
kelway
was
a
young
man
ardently
believed
in
by
a
large
circle
of
admirers
headed
by
himself
and
seconded
by
me
and
for
some
time
after
i
had
left
magdalen
for
sandhurst
i
maintained
a
correspondence
with
him
on
large
and
abstract
subjects
this
phase
of
our
friendship
did
not
survive
i
went
soldiering
to
india
and
leigh
kelway
took
honours
and
moved
suitably
on
into
politics
as
is
the
duty
of
an
earnest
young
radical
with
useful
family
connections
and
an
independent
income
since
then
i
had
at
intervals
seen
in
the
papers
the
name
of
the
honourable
basil
leigh
kelway
mentioned
as
a
speaker
at
elections
as
a
writer
of
thoughtful
articles
in
the
reviews
but
we
had
never
met
and
nothing
could
have
been
less
expected
by
me
than
the
letter
written
from
raverty
hotel
skebawn
in
which
he
told
me
he
was
making
a
tour
in
ireland
with
lord
waterbury
to
whom
he
was
private
secretary
lord
waterbury
was
at
present
having
a
few
days
fishing
near
killarney
and
he
himself
not
being
a
fisherman
was
collecting
statistics
for
his
chief
on
various
points
connected
with
the
liquor
question
in
ireland
he
had
heard
that
i
was
in
the
neighbourhood
and
was
kind
enough
to
add
that
it
would
give
him
much
pleasure
to
meet
me
again
with
a
stir
of
the
old
enthusiasm
i
wrote
begging
him
to
be
my
guest
for
as
long
as
it
suited
him
and
the
following
afternoon
he
arrived
at
shreelane
the
stout
young
friend
of
my
youth
had
changed
considerably
his
important
nose
and
slightly
prominent
teeth
remained
but
his
wavy
hair
had
withdrawn
intellectually
from
his
temples
his
eyes
had
acquired
a
statesmanlike
absence
of
expression
and
his
neck
had
grown
long
and
it
was
his
first
visit
to
ireland
as
he
lost
no
time
in
telling
me
and
he
and
his
chief
had
already
collected
much
valuable
information
on
the
subject
to
which
they
had
dedicated
the
easter
recess
he
further
informed
me
that
he
thought
of
popularising
the
subject
in
a
novel
and
therefore
intended
to
as
he
put
it
master
the
brogue
before
his
return
during
the
next
few
days
i
did
my
best
for
leigh
kelway
i
turned
him
loose
on
father
scanlan
i
showed
him
mohona
our
champion
village
that
boasts
fifteen
out
of
twenty
buildings
of
sorts
and
a
railway
station
i
took
him
to
hear
the
prosecution
of
a
publican
for
selling
drink
on
a
sunday
which
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
studying
perjury
as
a
fine
art
and
of
hearing
a
lady
on
whom
police
suspicion
justly
rested
profoundly
summed
up
by
the
sergeant
as
a
woman
who
had
th
appairance
of
having
knocked
at
a
back
door
the
net
result
of
these
experiences
has
not
yet
been
given
to
the
world
by
leigh
kelway
for
my
own
part
i
had
at
the
end
of
three
days
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
his
society
when
combined
with
a
and
a
thirst
for
statistics
was
not
what
i
used
to
find
it
at
oxford
i
therefore
welcomed
a
suggestion
from
mr
flurry
knox
that
we
should
accompany
him
to
some
typical
country
races
got
up
by
the
farmers
at
a
place
called
lisheen
some
twelve
miles
away
it
was
the
worst
road
in
the
district
the
races
of
the
most
grossly
unorthodox
character
in
fact
it
was
the
very
place
for
leigh
kelway
to
collect
impressions
of
irish
life
and
in
any
case
it
was
a
blessed
opportunity
of
disposing
of
him
for
the
day
in
my
guest
attire
next
morning
i
discerned
an
unbending
from
the
role
of
cabinet
minister
towards
that
of
sportsman
the
outlines
of
the
might
be
traced
in
his
breast
pocket
but
traversing
it
was
the
strap
of
a
pair
of
and
his
light
grey
suit
was
smart
enough
for
goodwood
flurry
was
to
drive
us
to
the
races
at
one
and
we
walked
to
tory
cottage
by
the
short
cut
over
the
hill
in
the
sunny
beauty
of
an
april
morning
up
to
the
present
the
weather
had
kept
me
in
a
more
or
less
apologetic
condition
any
one
who
has
entertained
a
guest
in
the
country
knows
the
unjust
weight
of
responsibility
that
rests
on
the
shoulders
of
the
host
in
the
matter
of
climate
and
leigh
kelway
after
two
drenchings
had
become
sarcastically
resigned
to
what
i
felt
he
regarded
as
my
mismanagement
flurry
took
us
into
the
house
for
a
drink
and
a
biscuit
to
keep
us
going
as
he
said
till
we
lifted
some
luncheon
out
of
the
castle
knox
people
at
the
races
and
it
was
while
we
were
thus
engaged
that
the
first
disaster
of
the
day
occurred
the
door
was
open
so
also
was
the
window
of
the
little
staircase
just
outside
it
and
through
the
window
travelled
sounds
that
told
of
the
close
proximity
of
the
the
clattering
of
hoofs
on
cobble
stones
and
voices
uplifted
in
loud
conversation
suddenly
from
this
region
there
arose
a
screech
of
the
laughter
peculiar
to
kitchen
flirtation
followed
by
the
clank
of
a
bucket
the
plunging
of
a
horse
and
then
an
uproar
of
wheels
and
galloping
hoofs
an
instant
afterwards
flurry
chestnut
cob
in
a
dogcart
dashed
at
full
gallop
into
view
with
the
reins
streaming
behind
him
and
two
men
in
hot
pursuit
almost
before
i
had
time
to
realise
what
had
happened
flurry
jumped
through
the
window
of
the
like
a
clown
at
a
pantomime
and
joined
in
the
chase
but
the
cob
was
resolved
to
make
the
most
of
his
chance
and
went
away
down
the
drive
and
out
of
sight
at
a
pace
that
distanced
every
one
save
the
kennel
terrier
who
sped
in
shrieking
ecstasy
beside
him
oh
merciful
hour
exclaimed
a
female
voice
behind
me
leigh
kelway
and
i
were
by
this
time
watching
the
progress
of
events
from
the
gravel
in
company
with
the
remainder
of
flurry
household
the
horse
is
desthroyed
was
that
the
quare
start
he
took
and
all
in
the
world
i
done
was
to
slap
a
bucket
of
wather
at
michael
out
the
windy
and
was
himself
got
it
in
place
of
michael
ye
never
ate
another
bit
bridgie
dunnigan
replied
the
cook
with
the
exulting
pessimism
of
her
kind
the
master
have
your
life
both
speakers
shouted
at
the
top
of
their
voices
probably
because
in
spirit
they
still
followed
afar
the
flight
of
the
cob
leigh
kelway
looked
serious
as
we
walked
on
down
the
drive
i
almost
dared
to
hope
that
a
note
on
the
degrading
oppression
of
irish
retainers
was
shaping
itself
before
we
reached
the
bend
of
the
drive
the
rescue
party
was
returning
with
the
fugitive
all
with
the
exception
of
the
kennel
terrier
looking
extremely
gloomy
the
cob
had
been
confronted
by
a
wooden
gate
which
he
had
unhesitatingly
taken
in
his
stride
landing
on
his
head
on
the
farther
side
with
the
gate
and
the
cart
on
top
of
him
and
had
arisen
with
a
lame
foreleg
a
cut
on
his
nose
and
several
other
minor
wounds
you
think
the
brute
had
been
fighting
the
cats
with
all
the
scratches
and
scrapes
he
has
on
him
said
flurry
casting
a
vengeful
eye
at
michael
and
one
shaft
broken
and
so
is
the
dashboard
i
have
another
horse
in
the
place
they
all
out
at
grass
and
so
there
an
end
of
the
races
we
all
three
stood
blankly
on
the
steps
and
watched
the
wreck
of
the
trap
being
trundled
up
the
avenue
i
very
sorry
you
done
out
of
your
sport
said
flurry
to
leigh
kelway
in
tones
of
deplorable
sincerity
perhaps
as
there
nothing
else
to
do
you
like
to
see
the
hounds
i
felt
for
flurry
but
of
the
two
i
felt
more
for
leigh
kelway
as
he
accepted
this
alleviation
he
disliked
dogs
and
held
the
newest
views
on
sanitation
and
i
knew
what
flurry
kennels
could
smell
like
i
was
lighting
a
precautionary
cigarette
when
we
caught
sight
of
an
old
man
riding
up
the
drive
flurry
stopped
short
hold
on
a
minute
he
said
here
an
old
chap
that
often
brings
me
horses
for
the
kennels
i
must
see
what
he
wants
the
man
dismounted
and
approached
knox
hat
in
hand
towing
after
him
a
gaunt
and
ancient
black
mare
with
a
big
knee
well
barrett
began
flurry
surveying
the
mare
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
i
not
giving
the
hounds
meat
this
month
or
only
very
little
ah
master
flurry
answered
barrett
it
you
that
pleasant
is
it
give
the
like
o
this
one
for
the
dogs
to
ate
she
a
vallyble
strong
young
mare
no
more
than
shixteen
years
of
age
and
ye
sooner
be
lookin
at
her
goin
under
a
than
eatin
your
dinner
there
is
as
much
meat
on
her
as
fatten
a
jackdaw
said
flurry
clinking
the
silver
in
his
pockets
as
he
searched
for
a
matchbox
what
are
you
asking
for
her
the
old
man
drew
cautiously
up
to
him
master
flurry
he
said
solemnly
i
sell
her
to
your
honour
for
five
pounds
and
she
be
worth
ten
after
you
give
her
a
grass
flurry
lit
his
cigarette
then
he
said
imperturbably
i
give
you
seven
shillings
for
her
old
barrett
put
on
his
hat
in
silence
and
in
silence
buttoned
his
coat
and
took
hold
of
the
stirrup
leather
flurry
remained
immovable
master
flurry
said
old
barrett
suddenly
with
tears
in
his
voice
you
must
make
it
eight
sir
michael
called
out
flurry
with
apparent
irrelevance
run
up
to
your
father
and
ask
him
would
he
lend
me
a
loan
of
his
later
we
were
improbable
as
it
may
seem
on
our
way
to
lisheen
races
we
were
seated
upon
an
of
immemorial
age
whose
joints
seemed
to
open
and
close
again
as
it
swung
in
and
out
of
the
ruts
whose
tattered
cushions
stank
of
rats
and
mildew
whose
wheels
staggered
and
rocked
like
the
legs
of
a
drunken
man
between
the
shafts
jogged
the
latest
addition
to
the
kennel
larder
the
mare
flurry
sat
on
one
side
and
kept
her
going
at
a
rate
of
not
less
than
four
miles
an
hour
leigh
kelway
and
i
held
on
to
the
other
she
get
us
as
far
as
lynch
anyway
said
flurry
abandoning
his
first
contention
that
she
could
do
the
whole
distance
as
he
pulled
her
on
to
her
legs
after
her
fifteenth
stumble
and
he
lend
us
some
sort
of
a
horse
if
it
was
only
a
mule
do
you
notice
that
these
cushions
are
very
damp
said
leigh
kelway
to
me
in
a
hollow
undertone
small
blame
to
them
if
they
are
replied
flurry
i
no
doubt
but
they
were
out
under
the
rain
all
day
yesterday
at
hurly
funeral
leigh
kelway
made
no
reply
but
he
took
his
out
of
his
pocket
and
sat
on
it
we
arrived
at
lynch
at
a
little
past
three
and
were
there
confronted
by
the
next
disappointment
of
this
disastrous
day
the
door
of
farmhouse
was
locked
and
nothing
replied
to
our
knocking
except
a
puppy
who
barked
hysterically
from
within
all
gone
to
the
races
said
flurry
philosophically
picking
his
way
round
the
manure
heap
no
matter
here
the
filly
in
the
shed
here
i
know
he
had
her
under
a
car
an
agitating
ten
minutes
ensued
during
which
leigh
kelway
and
i
got
the
mare
out
of
the
shafts
and
the
harness
and
flurry
with
our
inefficient
help
crammed
the
young
mare
into
them
as
flurry
had
stated
that
she
had
been
driven
before
i
was
bound
to
believe
him
but
the
difficulty
of
getting
the
bit
into
her
mouth
was
remarkable
and
so
also
was
the
manner
in
which
she
sidled
out
of
the
yard
with
flurry
and
myself
at
her
head
and
leigh
kelway
hanging
on
to
the
back
of
the
car
to
keep
it
from
jamming
in
the
gateway
sit
up
on
the
car
now
said
flurry
when
we
got
out
on
to
the
road
i
lead
her
on
a
bit
she
been
ploughed
anyway
one
side
of
her
mouth
as
tough
as
a
gad
leigh
kelway
threw
away
the
wisp
of
grass
with
which
he
had
been
cleaning
his
hands
and
mopped
his
intellectual
forehead
he
was
very
silent
we
both
mounted
the
car
and
flurry
with
the
reins
in
his
hand
walked
beside
the
filly
who
with
her
tail
clasped
in
moved
onward
in
a
succession
of
short
jerks
oh
she
all
right
said
flurry
beginning
to
run
and
dragging
the
filly
into
a
trot
once
she
gets
started
here
the
filly
spied
a
pig
in
a
neighbouring
field
and
despite
the
fact
that
she
had
probably
eaten
out
of
the
same
trough
with
it
she
gave
a
violent
side
spring
and
broke
into
a
gallop
now
we
off
shouted
flurry
making
a
jump
at
the
car
and
clambering
on
if
the
traces
hold
we
do
the
english
language
is
powerless
to
suggest
the
with
which
knox
ended
his
speech
or
to
do
more
than
indicate
the
rigid
anxiety
of
leigh
kelway
face
as
he
regained
his
balance
after
the
preliminary
jerk
and
clutched
the
back
rail
it
must
be
said
for
lynch
filly
that
she
did
not
kick
she
merely
fled
like
a
dog
with
a
kettle
tied
to
its
tail
from
the
pursuing
rattle
and
jingle
behind
her
with
the
shafts
buffeting
her
dusty
sides
as
the
car
swung
to
and
fro
whenever
she
showed
any
signs
of
slackening
flurry
loosed
another
yell
at
her
that
renewed
her
panic
and
thus
we
precariously
covered
another
two
or
three
miles
of
our
journey
had
it
not
been
for
a
large
stone
lying
on
the
road
and
had
the
filly
not
chosen
to
swerve
so
as
to
bring
the
wheel
on
top
of
it
i
dare
say
we
might
have
got
to
the
races
but
by
an
unfortunate
coincidence
both
these
things
occurred
and
when
we
recovered
from
the
consequent
shock
the
tire
of
one
of
the
wheels
had
come
off
and
was
trundling
with
cumbrous
gaiety
into
the
ditch
flurry
stopped
the
filly
and
began
to
laugh
leigh
kelway
said
something
startlingly
unparliamentary
under
his
breath
well
it
might
be
worse
flurry
said
consolingly
as
he
lifted
the
tire
on
to
the
car
we
not
half
a
mile
from
a
forge
we
walked
that
in
funereal
procession
behind
the
car
the
glory
had
departed
from
the
weather
and
an
ugly
wall
of
cloud
was
rising
up
out
of
the
west
to
meet
the
sun
the
hills
had
darkened
and
lost
colour
and
the
white
bog
cotton
shivered
in
a
cold
wind
that
smelt
of
rain
by
a
miracle
the
smith
was
not
at
the
races
owing
as
he
explained
to
his
having
the
toothaches
the
two
facts
combined
producing
in
him
a
morosity
only
equalled
by
that
of
leigh
kelway
the
smith
sole
comment
on
the
situation
was
to
unharness
the
filly
and
drag
her
into
the
forge
where
he
tied
her
up
he
then
proceeded
to
whistle
viciously
on
his
fingers
in
the
direction
of
a
cottage
and
to
command
in
tones
of
thunder
some
unseen
creature
to
bring
over
a
couple
of
baskets
of
turf
the
turf
arrived
in
process
of
time
on
a
back
and
was
arranged
in
a
circle
in
a
yard
at
the
back
of
the
forge
the
tire
was
bedded
in
it
and
the
turf
was
with
difficulty
kindled
at
different
points
ye
not
get
to
the
races
this
day
said
the
smith
yielding
to
a
sardonic
satisfaction
the
turf
wet
and
i
have
one
to
do
a
hand
turn
for
me
he
laid
the
wheel
on
the
ground
and
lit
his
pipe
leigh
kelway
looked
pallidly
about
him
over
the
spacious
empty
landscape
of
brown
mountain
slopes
patched
with
golden
furze
and
seamed
with
grey
walls
i
wondered
if
he
were
as
hungry
as
i
we
sat
on
stones
opposite
the
smouldering
ring
of
turf
and
smoked
and
flurry
beguiled
the
smith
into
grim
and
calumnious
confidences
about
every
horse
in
the
country
after
about
an
hour
during
which
the
turf
went
out
three
times
and
the
weather
became
more
and
more
threatening
a
girl
with
a
red
petticoat
over
her
head
appeared
at
the
gate
of
the
yard
and
said
to
the
smith
the
horse
is
gone
away
from
ye
where
exclaimed
flurry
springing
to
his
feet
i
met
him
walking
wesht
the
road
there
below
and
when
i
thought
to
turn
him
he
commenced
to
gallop
pulled
her
head
out
of
the
headstall
said
flurry
after
a
rapid
survey
of
the
forge
she
near
home
by
now
it
was
at
this
moment
that
the
rain
began
the
situation
could
scarcely
have
been
better
after
reviewing
the
position
flurry
and
i
decided
that
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
walk
to
a
a
couple
of
miles
farther
on
feed
there
if
possible
hire
a
car
and
go
home
it
was
an
uphill
walk
with
mild
generous
raindrops
striking
thicker
and
thicker
on
our
faces
no
one
talked
and
the
grey
clouds
crowded
up
from
behind
the
hills
like
billows
of
steam
leigh
kelway
bore
it
all
with
egregious
resignation
i
can
not
pretend
that
i
was
at
heart
sympathetic
but
by
virtue
of
being
his
host
i
felt
responsible
for
the
breakdown
for
his
light
suit
for
everything
and
divined
his
sentiment
of
horror
at
the
first
sight
of
the
it
was
a
long
low
cottage
with
a
line
of
dripping
overshadowing
it
empty
cars
and
carts
round
its
door
and
a
babel
from
within
made
it
evident
that
the
were
pursuing
a
gradual
homeward
route
the
shop
was
crammed
with
steaming
countrymen
whose
loud
brawling
voices
all
talking
together
roused
my
english
friend
to
his
first
remark
since
we
had
left
the
forge
surely
yeates
we
are
not
going
into
that
place
he
said
severely
those
men
are
all
drunk
ah
nothing
to
signify
said
flurry
plunging
in
and
driving
his
way
through
the
throng
like
a
plough
here
mary
kate
he
called
to
the
girl
behind
the
counter
tell
your
mother
we
want
some
tea
and
bread
and
butter
in
the
room
inside
the
smell
of
bad
tobacco
and
spilt
porter
was
choking
we
worked
our
way
through
it
after
him
towards
the
end
of
the
shop
intersecting
at
every
hand
discussions
about
the
races
tom
was
very
nice
he
spared
his
horse
all
along
and
then
he
put
into
him
well
at
goggin
corner
the
third
horse
was
before
the
second
but
he
was
goin
wake
in
himself
i
tell
ye
the
mare
had
the
hind
leg
fasht
in
the
fore
clancy
was
dipping
in
the
saddle
was
a
dam
nice
race
whatever
we
gained
the
inner
room
at
last
a
cheerless
apartment
adorned
with
sacred
pictures
a
and
an
array
of
supplementary
tumblers
and
wineglasses
but
at
all
events
we
had
it
so
far
to
ourselves
at
intervals
during
the
next
mary
kate
burst
in
with
cups
and
plates
cast
them
on
the
table
and
disappeared
but
of
food
there
was
no
sign
after
a
further
period
of
starvation
and
of
listening
to
the
noise
in
the
shop
flurry
made
a
sortie
and
after
lengthy
and
unknown
adventures
reappeared
carrying
a
huge
brown
teapot
and
driving
before
him
mary
kate
with
the
remainder
of
the
repast
the
bread
tasted
of
mice
the
butter
of
the
tea
of
brown
paper
but
we
had
got
past
the
critical
stage
i
had
entered
upon
my
third
round
of
bread
and
butter
when
the
door
was
flung
open
and
my
valued
acquaintance
slipper
slightly
advanced
in
liquor
presented
himself
to
our
gaze
his
bandy
legs
sprawled
consequentially
his
nose
was
redder
than
a
coal
of
fire
his
prominent
eyes
rolled
crookedly
upon
us
and
his
left
hand
swept
behind
him
the
attempt
of
mary
kate
to
frustrate
his
entrance
to
my
vinerable
friend
mr
flurry
knox
he
began
in
the
voice
of
a
town
crier
and
to
the
honourable
major
yeates
and
the
english
gintleman
this
impressive
opening
immediately
attracted
an
audience
from
the
shop
and
the
doorway
filled
with
grinning
faces
as
slipper
advanced
farther
into
the
room
why
were
ye
at
the
races
mr
flurry
he
went
on
his
roving
eye
taking
a
grip
of
us
all
at
the
same
time
sure
the
miss
bennetts
and
all
the
ladies
was
asking
where
were
ye
it
take
some
time
to
tell
them
that
said
flurry
with
his
mouth
full
but
what
about
the
races
slipper
had
you
good
sport
sport
is
it
divil
so
pleasant
an
afternoon
ever
you
seen
replied
slipper
he
leaned
against
a
side
table
and
all
the
glasses
on
it
jingled
does
your
honour
know
he
went
on
irrelevantly
sure
you
do
he
was
in
your
honour
stable
it
what
we
were

about

i
let
a

of
bawls
her
ye

says
i
good
in

that
ye
able
to
skelp
her
the
yell
and
the
histrionic
flourish
of
his
stick
with
which
slipper
delivered
this
incident
brought
down
the
house
leigh
kelway
was
sufficiently
moved
to
ask
me
in
an
undertone
if
skelp
was
a
local
term
well
mr
flurry
and
gintlemen
recommenced
slipper
i
declare
to
ye
when
owld
bocock
mare
heard
thim
roars
she
sthretched
out
her
neck
like
a
gandher
and
when
she
passed
me
out
she
give
a
couple
of
grunts
and
looked
at
me
as
ugly
as
a
christian
says
i
givin
her
a
couple
o
dhraws
o
th
ash
plant
across
the
butt
o
the
tail
the
way
i
would
blind
her
make
ye
grunt
says
i
nourish
ye
i
knew
well
she
was
very
frightful
of
th
ash
plant
since
the
winter
tommeen
sullivan
had
her
under
a
sidecar
but
now
in
place
of
any
obligations
to
me
ye
be
surprised
if
ye
heard
the
blaspheemious
expressions
of
that
young
boy
that
was
ridin
her
and
whether
it
was
he
was
turnin
around
the
way
i
hear
him
cursin
or
whether
it
was
some
slither
or
slide
came
to
owld
bocock
mare
i
dunno
but
she
was
bet
up
agin
the
last
obstackle
but
two
and
before
ye
could
say
she
was
standin
on
her
two
ears
beyond
in
other
field
i
declare
to
ye
on
the
vartue
of
me
oath
she
stood
that
way
till
she
reconnoithered
what
side
would
driscoll
fall
an
she
turned
about
then
and
rolled
on
him
as
cosy
as
if
he
was
meadow
grass
slipper
stopped
short
the
people
in
the
doorway
groaned
appreciatively
mary
kate
murmured
the
lord
save
us
the
blood
was
dhruv
out
through
his
nose
and
ears
continued
slipper
with
a
voice
that
indicated
the
cream
of
the
narration
and
you
hear
his
bones
crackin
on
the
ground
you
have
pitied
the
poor
boy
good
heavens
said
leigh
kelway
sitting
up
very
straight
in
his
chair
was
he
hurt
slipper
asked
flurry
casually
hurt
is
it
echoed
slipper
in
high
scorn
killed
on
the
spot
he
paused
to
relish
the
effect
of
the
on
leigh
kelway
oh
divil
so
pleasant
an
afthernoon
ever
you
seen
and
indeed
mr
flurry
it
what
we
were
all
sayin
it
was
a
great
pity
your
honour
was
not
there
for
the
likin
you
had
for
driscoll
as
he
spoke
the
last
word
there
was
an
outburst
of
singing
and
cheering
from
a
carload
of
people
who
had
just
pulled
up
at
the
door
flurry
listened
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
began
to
laugh
it
scarcely
strikes
one
as
a
comic
incident
said
leigh
kelway
very
coldly
to
me
in
fact
it
seems
to
me
that
the
police
ought
show
me
slipper
bawled
a
voice
in
the
shop
show
me
that
dirty
little
undherlooper
till
i
have
his
blood
had
i
the
race
won
only
for
he
souring
the
mare
on
me
what
that
you
say
i
tell
ye
he
did
he
left
seven
slaps
on
her
with
the
handle
of
a
there
was
in
the
room
in
which
we
were
sitting
a
second
door
leading
to
the
back
yard
a
door
consecrated
to
the
unobtrusive
visits
of
sunday
travellers
through
it
slipper
faded
away
like
a
dream
and
simultaneously
a
tall
young
man
with
a
face
like
a
potato
tied
up
in
a
bandage
squeezed
his
way
from
the
shop
into
the
room
well
driscoll
said
flurry
since
it
was
the
teeth
of
the
rake
he
left
on
the
mare
you
need
be
talking
leigh
kelway
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
a
wilder
expression
in
his
eye
than
i
had
thought
it
capable
of
i
read
in
it
a
resolve
to
abandon
ireland
to
her
fate
at
eight
we
were
still
waiting
for
the
car
that
we
had
been
assured
should
be
ours
directly
it
returned
from
the
races
at
eight
we
had
adopted
the
only
possible
course
that
remained
and
had
accepted
the
offers
of
lifts
on
the
laden
cars
that
were
returning
to
skebawn
and
i
presently
was
gratified
by
the
spectacle
of
my
friend
leigh
kelway
wedged
between
a
roulette
table
and
its
proprietor
on
one
side
of
a
car
with
driscoll
and
slipper
mysteriously
reconciled
and
excessively
drunk
seated
locked
in
each
other
arms
on
the
other
flurry
and
i
somewhat
similarly
placed
followed
on
two
other
cars
i
was
scarcely
surprised
when
i
was
informed
that
the
melancholy
white
animal
in
the
shafts
of
the
leading
car
was
owld
bocock
steeplechaser
the
night
was
very
dark
and
stormy
and
it
is
almost
superfluous
to
say
that
no
one
carried
lamps
the
rain
poured
upon
us
and
through
wind
and
wet
owld
bocock
mare
set
the
pace
at
a
rate
that
showed
she
knew
from
bitter
experience
what
was
expected
from
her
by
gentlemen
who
had
spent
the
evening
in
a
behind
her
the
other
two
tired
horses
followed
closely
incited
to
emulation
by
shouting
singing
and
a
liberal
allowance
of
whip
we
were
a
good
ten
miles
from
skebawn
and
never
had
the
road
seemed
so
long
for
mile
after
mile
the
low
walls
slid
past
us
with
occasional
plunges
into
caverns
of
darkness
under
trees
sometimes
from
a
wayside
cabin
a
dog
would
dash
out
to
bark
at
us
as
we
rattled
by
sometimes
our
cavalcade
swung
aside
to
pass
with
yells
and
crawling
carts
filled
with
other
belated
i
was
nearly
wet
through
even
though
i
received
considerable
shelter
from
a
skebawn
publican
who
slept
heavily
and
irrepressibly
on
my
shoulder
driscoll
on
the
leading
car
had
struck
up
an
approximation
to
the
wearing
of
the
green
when
a
wavering
star
appeared
on
the
road
ahead
of
us
it
grew
momently
larger
it
came
towards
us
apace
flurry
on
the
car
behind
me
shouted
suddenly
that
the
mail
car
with
one
of
the
lamps
out
tell
those
fellows
ahead
to
look
out
but
the
warning
fell
on
deaf
ears
when
laws
can
change
the
blades
of
grass
from
growing
as
they
grow
howled
five
discordant
voices
oblivious
of
the
towering
proximity
of
the
star
a
bianconi
mail
car
is
nearly
three
times
the
size
of
an
ordinary
outside
car
and
when
on
a
dark
night
it
advances
with
but
one
eye
it
is
difficult
for
even
a
sober
driver
to
calculate
its
bulk
above
the
sounds
of
melody
there
arose
the
thunder
of
heavy
wheels
the
splashing
trample
of
three
big
horses
then
a
crash
and
a
turmoil
of
shouts
our
cars
pulled
up
just
in
time
and
i
tore
myself
from
the
embrace
of
my
publican
to
go
to
leigh
kelway
assistance
the
wing
of
the
bianconi
had
caught
the
wing
of
the
smaller
car
flinging
owld
bocock
mare
on
her
side
and
throwing
her
freight
headlong
on
top
of
her
the
heap
being
surmounted
by
the
roulette
table
the
driver
of
the
mail
car
unshipped
his
solitary
lamp
and
turned
it
on
the
disaster
i
saw
that
flurry
had
already
got
hold
of
leigh
kelway
by
the
heels
and
was
dragging
him
from
under
the
others
he
struggled
up
hatless
muddy
and
gasping
with
driscoll
hanging
on
by
his
neck
still
singing
the
wearing
of
the
green
a
voice
from
the
mail
car
said
incredulously
kelway
a
spectacled
face
glared
down
upon
him
from
under
the
dripping
spikes
of
an
umbrella
it
was
the
right
honourable
the
earl
of
waterbury
leigh
chief
returning
from
his
fishing
excursion
meanwhile
slipper
in
the
ditch
did
not
cease
to
announce
that
divil
so
pleasant
an
afthernoon
ever
ye
seen
as
what
was
in
it
vi
philippa
no
one
can
accuse
philippa
and
me
of
having
married
in
haste
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
but
little
under
five
years
from
that
autumn
evening
on
the
river
when
i
had
said
what
is
called
in
ireland
the
hard
word
to
the
day
in
august
when
i
was
led
to
the
altar
by
my
best
man
and
was
subsequently
led
away
from
it
by
sinclair
yeates
about
two
years
out
of
the
five
had
been
spent
by
me
at
shreelane
in
ceaseless
warfare
with
drains
eaveshoots
chimneys
pumps
all
those
fundamentals
in
short
that
the
ingenuous
and
improving
tenant
expects
to
find
established
as
a
basis
from
which
to
rise
to
higher
things
as
far
as
rising
to
higher
things
went
frequent
ascents
to
the
roof
to
search
for
leaks
summed
up
my
achievements
in
fact
i
suffered
so
general
a
shrinkage
of
my
ideals
that
the
triumph
of
making
the
bell
ring
blinded
me
to
the
fact
that
the
in
the
hall
floor
were
nailed
up
with
pieces
of
tin
biscuit
boxes
and
that
the
casual
visitor
could
instead
of
leaving
a
card
have
easily
written
his
name
in
the
damp
on
the
walls
philippa
however
proved
adorably
callous
to
these
and
similar
shortcomings
she
regarded
shreelane
and
its
floundering
foundering
ménage
of
incapables
in
the
light
of
a
gigantic
picnic
in
a
foreign
land
she
held
long
conversations
daily
with
cadogan
in
order
as
she
informed
me
to
acquire
the
language
without
any
ulterior
domestic
intention
she
engaged
because
of
the
beauty
of
their
eyes
and
housemaids
because
they
had
such
delightfully
picturesque
old
mothers
and
she
declined
to
correct
the
phraseology
of
the
whose
painful
habit
it
was
to
whisper
do
ye
choose
cherry
or
clarry
when
proffering
the
wine
perhaps
afforded
my
wife
her
first
insight
into
the
sterner
realities
of
irish
housekeeping
philippa
had
what
are
known
as
high
church
proclivities
and
took
the
matter
seriously
i
do
know
how
we
are
to
manage
for
the
servants
dinner
sinclair
she
said
coming
in
to
my
office
one
thursday
morning
julia
says
she
god
this
long
time
that
she
would
eat
an
egg
on
a
and
the
says
she
wo
eat
herrings
they
fried
with
onions
and
cadogan
says
she
will
go
to
them
extremes
for
servants
i
should
let
cadogan
settle
the
menu
herself
i
suggested
i
asked
her
to
do
that
replied
philippa
and
she
only
said
she
god
she
had
no
appetite
the
lady
of
the
house
here
fell
away
into
unseasonable
laughter
i
made
the
demoralising
suggestion
that
as
we
were
going
away
for
a
couple
of
nights
we
might
safely
leave
them
to
fight
it
out
and
the
problem
was
abandoned
philippa
had
been
much
called
on
by
the
neighbourhood
in
all
its
shades
and
grades
and
daily
she
and
her
trousseau
frocks
presented
themselves
at
of
varying
dimensions
in
due
acknowledgment
of
civilities
in
ireland
it
may
be
noted
the
process
known
in
england
as
summering
and
wintering
a
newcomer
does
not
obtain
sociability
and
curiosity
alike
forbid
delay
the
visit
to
which
we
owed
our
escape
from
the
intricacies
of
the
was
to
the
knoxes
of
castle
knox
relations
in
some
remote
and
tribal
way
of
my
landlord
mr
flurry
of
that
ilk
it
involved
a
short
journey
by
train
and
my
wife
longest
it
also
which
was
more
serious
involved
my
being
lent
a
horse
to
go
out
cubbing
the
following
morning
at
castle
knox
we
sank
into
an
almost
forgotten
environment
of
windows
and
doors
of
deep
carpets
of
silent
servants
instead
of
clattering
belligerents
philippa
told
me
afterwards
that
it
had
only
been
by
an
effort
that
she
had
restrained
herself
from
snatching
up
the
train
of
her
as
she
paced
across
the
wide
hall
on
little
sir
valentine
arm
after
three
weeks
at
shreelane
she
found
it
difficult
to
remember
that
the
floor
was
neither
damp
nor
dusty
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
of
the
limited
number
of
those
who
got
on
with
lady
knox
chiefly
i
imagine
because
i
was
as
a
worm
before
her
and
thankfully
permitted
her
to
do
all
the
talking
your
wife
is
extremely
pretty
she
pronounced
autocratically
surveying
philippa
between
the
does
she
ride
lady
knox
was
a
short
square
lady
with
a
face
and
an
eye
decisive
from
long
habit
of
taking
her
own
line
across
country
and
elsewhere
she
would
have
made
a
very
imposing
little
coachman
and
would
have
caused
her
stable
helpers
to
rue
the
day
they
had
the
presumption
to
be
born
it
struck
me
that
sir
valentine
sometimes
did
so
i
glad
you
like
her
looks
i
replied
as
i
fear
you
will
find
her
thoroughly
despicable
otherwise
for
one
thing
she
not
only
ride
but
she
believes
that
i
can
oh
come
you
not
as
bad
as
all
that
my
hostess
was
good
enough
to
say
i
going
to
put
you
up
on
sorcerer
and
we
see
you
at
the
top
of
the
hunt
if
there
is
one
that
young
knox
has
a
notion
how
to
draw
these
woods
well
the
best
run
we
had
last
year
out
of
this
place
was
with
flurry
hounds
struck
in
miss
sally
sole
daughter
of
sir
valentine
house
and
home
from
her
place
down
the
table
it
was
not
difficult
to
see
that
she
and
her
mother
held
different
views
on
the
subject
of
mr
flurry
knox
i
call
it
a
criminal
thing
in
any
one
to
rear
up
a
preposterous
troop
of
sons
and
plant
them
all
out
in
his
own
country
lady
knox
said
to
me
with
apparent
irrelevance
i
detest
collaterals
blood
may
be
thicker
than
water
but
it
is
also
a
great
deal
nastier
in
this
country
i
find
that
fifteenth
cousins
consider
themselves
near
relations
if
they
live
within
twenty
miles
of
one
having
before
now
taken
in
the
position
with
regard
to
flurry
knox
i
took
care
to
accept
these
remarks
as
generalities
and
turned
the
conversation
to
other
themes
i
see
yeates
is
doing
wonders
with
hamilton
said
lady
knox
presently
following
the
direction
of
my
eyes
which
had
strayed
away
to
where
philippa
was
beaming
upon
her
neighbour
a
old
clergyman
who
was
delivering
a
long
dissertation
the
purport
of
which
we
were
happily
unable
to
catch
she
has
always
had
a
gift
for
the
church
i
said
not
curates
said
lady
knox
in
her
deep
voice
i
made
haste
to
reply
that
it
was
the
elders
of
the
church
who
were
venerated
by
my
wife
well
she
has
her
fancy
in
old
eustace
hamilton
he
elderly
enough
said
lady
knox
i
wonder
if
she
venerate
him
as
much
if
she
knew
that
he
had
fought
with
his
and
they
have
spoken
for
thirty
years
though
for
the
matter
of
that
she
added
i
think
it
shows
his
good
sense
knox
is
rather
a
friend
of
mine
i
ventured
is
she
h
well
she
not
one
of
mine
replied
my
hostess
with
her
usual
definiteness
i
say
one
thing
for
her
i
believe
always
been
a
sportswoman
she
very
rich
you
know
and
they
say
she
only
married
old
badger
knox
to
save
his
hounds
from
being
sold
to
pay
his
debts
and
then
she
took
the
horn
from
him
and
hunted
them
herself
has
she
been
rude
to
your
wife
yet
no
oh
well
she
will
it
a
mere
question
of
time
she
hates
all
english
people
you
know
the
story
they
tell
of
her
she
was
coming
home
from
london
and
when
she
was
getting
her
ticket
the
man
asked
if
she
had
said
a
ticket
for
york
thank
god
cork
says
mrs
knox
well
i
rather
agree
with
her
said
i
but
why
did
she
fight
with
mr
hamilton
oh
nobody
knows
i
do
believe
they
know
themselves
whatever
it
was
the
old
lady
drives
five
miles
to
fortwilliam
every
sunday
rather
than
go
to
his
church
just
outside
her
own
back
gates
lady
knox
said
with
a
laugh
like
a
terrier
bark
i
wish
i
fought
with
him
myself
she
said
he
gives
us
forty
minutes
every
sunday
as
i
struggled
into
my
boots
the
following
morning
i
felt
that
sir
valentine
acid
confidences
on
bestowed
on
me
at
midnight
did
credit
to
his
judgment
a
very
moderate
amusement
my
dear
major
he
had
said
in
his
dry
little
voice
you
should
stick
to
shooting
no
one
expects
you
to
shoot
before
daybreak
it
was
six
as
i
crept
downstairs
and
found
lady
knox
and
miss
sally
at
breakfast
with
two
lamps
on
the
table
and
a
foggy
daylight
oozing
in
from
under
the
blinds
philippa
was
already
in
the
hall
pumping
up
her
bicycle
in
a
state
of
excitement
at
the
prospect
of
her
first
experience
of
hunting
that
would
have
been
more
comprehensible
to
me
had
she
been
going
to
ride
a
strange
horse
as
i
was
as
i
bolted
my
food
i
saw
the
horses
being
led
past
the
windows
and
a
faint
twang
of
a
horn
told
that
flurry
knox
and
his
hounds
were
not
far
off
miss
sally
jumped
up
if
i
not
on
the
cockatoo
before
the
hounds
come
up
i
shall
never
get
there
she
said
hobbling
out
of
the
room
in
the
toils
of
her
safety
habit
her
small
alert
face
looked
very
childish
under
her
the
struck
sparks
out
of
her
thick
coil
of
hair
i
wondered
how
i
had
ever
thought
her
like
her
prim
little
father
she
was
already
on
her
white
cob
when
i
got
to
the
and
flurry
knox
was
riding
over
the
glistening
wet
grass
with
his
hounds
while
his
whip
jerome
hickey
was
having
a
stirring
time
with
the
young
entry
and
the
they
moved
on
without
stopping
up
a
back
avenue
under
tall
and
dripping
trees
to
a
thick
laurel
covert
at
some
little
distance
from
the
house
into
this
the
hounds
were
thrown
and
the
usual
period
of
fidgety
inaction
set
in
for
the
riders
of
whom
all
told
there
were
about
lady
knox
square
and
solid
on
her
big
confidential
was
near
me
and
her
eyes
were
on
me
and
my
mount
with
her
rubicund
face
and
white
collar
she
was
more
than
ever
like
a
coachman
sorcerer
looks
as
if
he
suited
you
well
she
said
after
a
few
minutes
of
silence
during
which
the
hounds
rustled
and
crackled
steadily
through
the
laurels
he
a
little
high
on
the
leg
and
so
are
you
you
know
so
you
show
each
other
off
sorcerer
was
standing
like
a
rock
with
his
head
in
the
air
and
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
covert
his
manners
so
far
had
been
those
of
a
perfect
gentleman
and
were
in
marked
contrast
to
those
of
miss
sally
cob
who
was
sidling
hopping
and
snatching
unappeasably
at
his
bit
philippa
had
disappeared
from
view
down
the
avenue
ahead
the
fog
was
melting
and
the
sun
threw
long
blades
of
light
through
the
trees
everything
was
quiet
and
in
the
distance
the
curtained
windows
of
the
house
marked
the
warm
repose
of
sir
valentine
and
those
of
the
party
who
shared
his
opinion
of
cubbing
hark
hark
to
cry
there
it
was
flurry
voice
away
at
the
other
side
of
the
covert
the
rustling
and
brushing
through
the
laurels
became
more
vehement
then
passed
out
of
hearing
he
never
will
leave
his
hounds
alone
said
lady
knox
disapprovingly
miss
sally
and
the
cockatoo
moved
away
in
a
series
of
heraldic
capers
towards
the
end
of
the
laurel
plantation
and
at
the
same
moment
i
saw
philippa
on
her
bicycle
shoot
into
view
on
the
drive
ahead
of
us
i
seen
a
fox
she
screamed
white
with
what
i
believe
to
have
been
personal
terror
though
she
says
it
was
excitement
it
passed
quite
close
to
me
what
way
did
he
go
bellowed
a
voice
which
i
recognised
as
hickey
somewhere
in
the
deep
of
the
laurels
down
the
drive
returned
philippa
with
a
quality
in
her
tones
with
which
i
was
quite
unacquainted
an
electrifying
screech
of
gone
away
was
projected
from
the
laurels
by
hickey
gone
away
chanted
flurry
horn
at
the
top
of
the
covert
this
is
what
he
calls
cubbing
said
lady
knox
a
mere
farce
but
none
the
less
she
loosed
her
sedate
monster
into
a
canter
sorcerer
got
his
under
him
and
hardened
his
crest
against
the
bit
as
we
all
hustled
along
the
drive
after
the
flying
figure
of
my
wife
i
knew
very
little
about
horses
but
i
realised
that
even
with
the
hounds
tumbling
hysterically
out
of
the
covert
and
the
cockatoo
kicking
the
gravel
into
his
face
sorcerer
comported
himself
with
the
manners
of
the
best
society
up
a
side
road
i
saw
flurry
knox
opening
half
of
a
gate
and
cramming
through
it
in
a
moment
we
also
had
crammed
through
and
the
turf
of
a
pasture
field
was
under
our
feet
hickey
leaned
forward
and
took
hold
of
his
horse
i
did
likewise
with
the
trifling
difference
that
my
horse
took
hold
of
me
and
i
steered
for
flurry
knox
with
purpose
the
hounds
already
a
field
ahead
being
merely
an
exciting
and
noisy
accompaniment
of
this
endeavour
a
heavy
stone
wall
was
the
first
occurrence
of
note
flurry
chose
a
place
where
the
top
was
loose
and
his
brown
mare
changed
feet
on
the
rattling
stones
like
a
fairy
sorcerer
came
at
it
tense
and
collected
as
a
bow
at
full
stretch
and
sailed
steeply
into
the
air
i
saw
the
wall
far
beneath
me
with
an
unsuspected
ditch
on
the
far
side
and
i
felt
my
hat
following
me
at
the
full
stretch
of
its
guard
as
we
swept
over
it
then
with
a
long
slant
we
descended
to
earth
some
sixteen
feet
from
where
we
had
left
it
and
i
was
possessor
of
the
gratifying
fact
that
i
had
achieved
a
fly
and
had
not
perceptibly
moved
in
my
saddle
subsequent
disillusioning
experience
has
taught
me
that
but
few
horses
jump
like
sorcerer
so
gallantly
so
sympathetically
and
with
such
supreme
mastery
of
the
subject
but
none
the
less
the
enthusiasm
that
he
imparted
to
me
has
never
been
extinguished
and
that
october
morning
ride
revealed
to
me
the
unsuspected
intoxication
of
behind
me
i
heard
the
scrabbling
of
the
cockatoo
little
hoofs
among
the
loose
stones
and
lady
knox
galloping
on
my
left
jerked
a
maternal
chin
over
her
shoulder
to
mark
her
daughter
progress
for
my
part
had
there
been
an
entire
circus
behind
me
i
was
far
too
much
occupied
with
ramming
on
my
hat
and
trying
to
hold
sorcerer
to
have
looked
round
and
all
my
spare
faculties
were
devoted
to
steering
for
flurry
who
had
taken
a
turn
and
was
at
that
moment
surmounting
a
bank
of
uncertain
and
briary
aspect
i
surmounted
it
also
with
the
swiftness
and
simplicity
for
which
the
quaker
methods
of
bank
jumping
had
not
prepared
me
and
two
or
three
fields
traversed
at
the
same
steeplechase
pace
brought
us
to
a
road
and
to
an
abrupt
check
there
suddenly
were
the
hounds
scrambling
in
baffled
silence
down
into
the
road
from
the
opposite
bank
to
look
for
the
line
they
had
overrun
and
there
amazingly
was
philippa
engaged
in
excited
converse
with
several
men
with
spades
over
their
shoulders
did
ye
see
the
fox
boys
shouted
flurry
addressing
the
group
we
did
we
did
cried
my
wife
and
her
friends
in
chorus
he
ran
up
the
road
we
be
badly
off
without
mrs
yeates
said
flurry
as
he
whirled
his
mare
round
and
clattered
up
the
road
with
a
hustle
of
hounds
after
him
it
occurred
to
me
as
forcibly
as
any
mere
earthly
thing
can
occur
to
those
who
are
wrapped
in
the
sublimities
of
a
run
that
for
a
young
woman
who
had
never
before
seen
a
fox
out
of
a
cage
at
the
zoo
philippa
was
taking
to
hunting
very
kindly
her
cheeks
were
a
most
brilliant
pink
her
blue
eyes
shone
oh
sinclair
she
exclaimed
they
say
he
going
for
aussolas
and
there
a
road
i
can
ride
all
the
way
ye
can
miss
sure
we
show
you
chorussed
her
cortège
her
foot
was
on
the
pedal
ready
to
mount
decidedly
my
wife
was
in
no
need
of
assistance
from
me
up
the
road
a
hound
gave
a
yelp
of
discovery
and
flung
himself
over
a
stile
into
the
fields
the
rest
of
the
pack
went
squealing
and
jostling
after
him
and
i
followed
flurry
over
one
of
those
infinitely
varied
erections
pleasantly
termed
gaps
in
ireland
on
this
occasion
the
gap
was
made
of
three
slabs
of
slate
leaning
against
an
iron
bar
and
sorcerer
conveyed
to
me
his
thorough
knowledge
of
the
matter
by
a
lift
of
his
that
made
me
feel
as
if
i
were
being
skilfully
kicked
downstairs
to
what
extent
i
looked
it
i
can
not
say
nor
providentially
can
philippa
as
she
had
already
started
i
only
know
that
undeserved
good
luck
restored
to
me
my
stirrup
before
sorcerer
got
away
with
me
in
the
next
field
what
followed
was
i
am
told
a
very
fast
fifteen
minutes
for
me
time
was
not
the
empty
fields
rushed
past
uncounted
fences
came
and
went
in
a
flash
while
the
wind
sang
in
my
ears
and
the
dazzle
of
the
early
sun
was
in
my
eyes
i
saw
the
hounds
occasionally
sometimes
pouring
over
a
green
bank
as
the
charging
breaker
lifts
and
flings
itself
sometimes
driving
across
a
field
as
the
white
tongues
of
foam
slide
racing
over
the
sand
and
always
ahead
of
me
was
flurry
knox
going
as
a
man
goes
who
knows
his
country
who
knows
his
horse
and
whose
heart
is
wholly
and
absolutely
in
the
right
place
do
what
i
would
sorcerer
implacable
stride
carried
me
closer
and
closer
to
the
brown
mare
till
as
i
thundered
down
the
slope
of
a
long
field
i
was
not
twenty
yards
behind
flurry
sorcerer
had
stiffened
his
neck
to
iron
and
to
slow
him
down
was
beyond
me
but
i
fought
his
head
away
to
the
right
and
found
myself
coming
hard
and
steady
at
a
stonefaced
bank
with
broken
ground
in
front
of
it
flurry
bore
away
to
the
left
shouting
something
that
i
did
not
understand
that
sorcerer
shortened
his
stride
at
the
right
moment
was
entirely
due
to
his
own
judgment
standing
well
away
from
the
jump
he
rose
like
a
stag
out
of
the
tussocky
ground
and
as
he
swung
my
twelve
stone
six
into
the
air
the
obstacle
revealed
itself
to
him
and
me
as
consisting
not
of
one
bank
but
of
two
and
between
the
two
lay
a
deep
grassy
lane
half
choked
with
furze
i
have
often
been
asked
to
state
the
width
of
the
bohereen
and
can
only
reply
that
in
my
opinion
it
was
at
least
eighteen
feet
flurry
knox
and
hickey
who
did
not
jump
it
say
that
it
is
not
more
than
five
what
sorcerer
did
with
it
i
can
not
say
the
sensation
was
of
a
towering
flight
with
a
kick
back
in
it
a
biggish
drop
and
a
landing
on
still
on
the
downhill
grade
that
was
how
one
of
the
best
horses
in
ireland
took
one
of
ireland
most
ignorant
riders
over
a
very
nasty
place
a
sombre
line
of
lay
ahead
rimmed
with
a
grey
wall
and
in
another
couple
of
minutes
we
had
pulled
up
on
the
aussolas
road
and
were
watching
the
hounds
struggling
over
the
wall
into
aussolas
demesne
no
hurry
now
said
flurry
turning
in
his
saddle
to
watch
the
cockatoo
jump
into
the
road
he
to
ground
in
the
big
earth
inside
well
major
it
well
for
you
that
a
horse
i
thought
you
were
a
dead
man
a
while
ago
when
you
faced
him
at
the
bohereen
i
was
disclaiming
intention
in
the
matter
when
lady
knox
and
the
others
joined
us
i
thought
you
told
me
your
wife
was
no
sportswoman
she
said
to
me
critically
scanning
sorcerer
legs
for
cuts
the
while
but
when
i
saw
her
a
minute
ago
she
had
abandoned
her
bicycle
and
was
running
across
country
like
look
at
her
now
interrupted
miss
sally
oh
oh
in
the
interval
between
these
exclamations
my
incredulous
eyes
beheld
my
wife
in
hand
in
hand
with
a
couple
of
stalwart
country
boys
with
whom
she
was
leaping
in
unison
from
the
top
of
a
bank
on
to
the
road
every
one
even
the
saturnine
hickey
began
to
laugh
i
rode
back
to
philippa
who
was
exchanging
compliments
and
congratulations
with
her
escort
oh
sinclair
she
cried
was
it
splendid
i
saw
you
jumping
and
everything
where
are
they
going
now
my
dear
girl
i
said
with
marital
disapproval
you
killing
yourself
where
your
bicycle
oh
it
punctured
in
a
sort
of
lane
back
there
it
all
right
and
then
they
she
breathlessly
waved
her
hand
at
her
attendants
they
showed
me
the
way
begor
you
proved
very
good
miss
said
a
grinning
cavalier
faith
she
did
said
another
polishing
his
shining
brow
with
his
white
flannel
she
lepped
like
a
haarse
and
may
i
ask
how
you
propose
to
go
home
said
i
i
do
know
and
i
do
care
i
not
going
home
she
cast
an
entirely
disobedient
eye
at
me
and
your
is
hanging
down
your
back
and
your
tie
is
bulging
out
over
your
waistcoat
the
little
group
of
riders
had
begun
to
move
away
we
going
on
into
aussolas
called
out
flurry
come
on
and
make
my
grandmother
give
you
some
breakfast
yeates
she
always
has
it
at
eight
the
front
gates
were
close
at
hand
and
we
turned
in
under
the
tall
with
the
unswept
leaves
rustling
round
the
horses
feet
and
the
lovely
blue
of
the
october
morning
sky
filling
the
spaces
between
smooth
grey
branches
and
golden
leaves
the
woods
rang
with
the
voices
of
the
hounds
enjoying
an
untrammelled
rabbit
hunt
while
the
master
and
the
whip
both
on
foot
strolled
along
unconcernedly
with
their
bridles
over
their
arms
making
themselves
agreeable
to
my
wife
an
occasional
touch
of
flurry
horn
or
a
crack
of
whip
just
indicating
to
the
pack
that
the
authorities
still
took
a
friendly
interest
in
their
doings
down
a
grassy
glade
in
the
wood
a
party
of
old
knox
young
horses
suddenly
swept
into
view
headed
by
an
old
mare
who
with
her
tail
over
her
back
stampeded
ponderously
past
our
cavalcade
shaking
and
swinging
her
handsome
old
head
while
her
youthful
friends
bucked
and
kicked
and
snapped
at
each
other
round
her
with
the
ferocious
humour
of
their
kind
here
jerome
take
the
horn
said
flurry
to
hickey
i
going
to
see
yeates
up
to
the
house
the
way
these
tomfools
wo
gallop
on
top
of
her
from
this
point
it
seems
to
me
that
philippa
adventures
are
more
worthy
of
record
than
mine
and
as
she
has
favoured
me
with
a
full
account
of
them
i
venture
to
think
my
version
may
be
relied
on
knox
was
already
at
breakfast
when
philippa
was
led
quaking
into
her
formidable
presence
my
wife
acquaintance
with
knox
was
so
far
limited
to
a
state
visit
on
either
side
and
she
found
but
little
comfort
in
flurry
assurances
that
his
grandmother
would
mind
if
he
brought
all
the
hounds
in
to
breakfast
coupled
with
the
statement
that
she
would
put
her
eyes
on
sticks
for
the
major
whatever
the
truth
of
this
may
have
been
knox
received
her
guest
with
an
equanimity
quite
unshaken
by
the
fact
that
her
boots
were
in
the
fender
instead
of
on
her
feet
and
that
a
couple
of
shawls
of
varying
dimensions
and
degrees
of
age
did
not
conceal
the
inner
presence
of
a
magenta
flannel
she
installed
philippa
at
the
table
and
plied
her
with
food
oblivious
as
to
whether
the
needful
implements
with
which
to
eat
it
were
forthcoming
or
no
she
told
flurry
where
a
vixen
had
reared
her
family
and
she
watched
him
ride
away
with
some
biting
comments
on
his
mare
hocks
screamed
after
him
from
the
window
the
at
aussolas
castle
is
one
of
the
many
rooms
in
ireland
in
which
cromwell
is
said
to
have
stabled
his
horse
and
probably
no
one
would
have
objected
less
than
knox
had
she
been
consulted
in
the
matter
philippa
questions
if
the
room
had
ever
been
tidied
up
since
and
she
endorses
flurry
observation
that
there
was
a
day
in
the
year
you
would
get
feeding
for
a
hen
and
chickens
on
the
floor
opposite
to
philippa
on
a
louis
quinze
chair
sat
woolly
dog
its
suspicious
little
eyes
peering
at
her
out
of
their
setting
of
pink
lids
and
dirty
white
wool
a
couple
of
young
horses
outside
the
windows
tore
at
the
matted
creepers
on
the
walls
or
thrust
faces
that
were
into
the
room
portly
pigeons
waddled
to
and
fro
on
the
broad
sometimes
flying
in
to
perch
on
the
while
they
kept
up
incessantly
a
hoarse
and
pompous
cooing
animals
and
children
are
as
a
rule
alike
destructive
to
conversation
but
knox
when
she
chose
could
have
made
herself
agreeable
in
a
noah
ark
and
philippa
has
a
gift
of
sympathetic
attention
that
personal
experience
has
taught
me
to
regard
with
distrust
as
well
as
respect
while
it
has
often
made
me
realise
the
worldly
wisdom
of
kingsley
injunction
be
good
sweet
maid
and
let
who
will
be
clever
family
prayers
declaimed
by
knox
with
alarming
austerity
followed
close
on
breakfast
philippa
and
a
henchwoman
forming
the
family
the
prayers
were
long
and
through
the
open
window
as
they
progressed
came
distantly
a
whoop
or
two
the
declamatory
tones
staggered
a
little
and
then
continued
at
a
distinctly
higher
rate
of
speed
whispered
a
small
voice
at
the
window
knox
made
a
repressive
gesture
and
held
on
her
way
a
sudden
outcry
of
hounds
followed
and
the
owner
of
the
whisper
a
small
boy
with
a
face
freckled
like
a
turkey
egg
darted
from
the
window
and
dragged
a
donkey
and
into
view
philippa
admits
to
having
lost
the
thread
of
the
discourse
but
she
thinks
that
the
amen
that
immediately
ensued
can
hardly
have
come
in
its
usual
place
knox
shut
the
book
abruptly
scrambled
up
from
her
knees
and
said
found
in
a
surprisingly
short
space
of
time
she
had
added
to
her
attire
her
boots
a
fur
cape
and
a
garden
hat
and
was
in
the
the
small
boy
stimulating
the
donkey
with
the
success
peculiar
to
his
class
while
philippa
hung
on
behind
the
woods
of
aussolas
are
hilly
and
extensive
and
on
that
particular
morning
it
seemed
that
they
held
as
many
foxes
as
hounds
in
vain
was
the
horn
blown
and
the
whips
cracked
small
rejoicing
parties
of
hounds
each
with
a
fox
of
its
own
scoured
to
and
fro
every
labourer
in
the
vicinity
had
left
his
work
and
was
sedulously
heading
every
fox
with
yells
that
would
have
befitted
a
tiger
hunt
and
sticks
and
stones
when
occasion
served
will
i
pull
out
as
far
as
the
big
inquired
the
small
boy
i
seen
three
of
the
dogs
go
in
it
and
they
yowling
you
will
said
knox
thumping
the
donkey
on
the
back
with
her
umbrella
here
jeremiah
regan
come
down
out
of
that
with
that
pitchfork
do
you
want
to
kill
the
fox
you
fool
i
do
not
your
honour
responded
jeremiah
regan
a
tall
young
countryman
emerging
from
a
bramble
brake
did
you
see
him
said
knox
eagerly
i
seen
himself
and
his
ten
pups
drinking
below
at
the
lake
ere
yestherday
your
honour
and
he
as
big
as
a
chestnut
horse
said
jeremiah
faugh
yesterday
snorted
knox
go
on
to
the
rhododendrons
johnny
the
party
reinforced
by
jeremiah
and
the
pitchfork
progressed
at
a
high
rate
of
speed
along
the
shrubbery
path
encountering
lady
knox
stooping
on
to
her
horse
neck
under
the
sweeping
branches
of
the
laurels
your
horse
is
too
high
for
my
coverts
lady
knox
said
the
lady
of
the
manor
with
a
malicious
eye
at
lady
knox
flushed
face
and
dinged
hat
i
afraid
you
will
be
left
behind
like
absalom
when
the
hounds
go
away
as
they
never
do
anything
here
but
hunt
rabbits
retorted
her
ladyship
i
do
think
that
likely
knox
gave
her
donkey
another
whack
and
passed
on
rabbits
my
dear
she
said
scornfully
to
philippa
that
all
she
knows
about
it
i
declare
it
disgusts
me
to
see
a
woman
of
that
age
making
such
a
judy
of
herself
rabbits
indeed
down
in
the
thicket
of
rhododendron
everything
was
very
quiet
for
a
time
philippa
strained
her
eyes
in
vain
to
see
any
of
the
riders
the
horn
blowing
and
the
whip
cracking
passed
on
almost
out
of
hearing
once
or
twice
a
hound
worked
through
the
rhododendrons
glanced
at
the
party
and
hurried
on
immersed
in
business
all
at
once
johnny
the
whispered
excitedly
look
at
he
look
at
he
and
pointed
to
a
boulder
of
grey
rock
that
stood
out
among
the
dark
evergreens
a
big
yellow
cub
was
crouching
on
it
he
instantly
slid
into
the
shelter
of
the
bushes
and
the
irrepressible
jeremiah
uttering
a
rending
shriek
plunged
into
the
thicket
after
him
two
or
three
hounds
came
rushing
at
the
sound
and
after
this
philippa
says
she
finds
some
difficulty
in
recalling
the
proper
order
of
events
chiefly
she
confesses
because
of
the
wholly
ridiculous
tears
of
excitement
that
blurred
her
eyes
we
ran
she
said
we
simply
tore
and
the
donkey
galloped
and
as
for
that
old
knox
she
was
giving
cracked
screams
to
the
hounds
all
the
time
and
they
were
screaming
too
and
then
somehow
we
were
all
out
on
the
road
what
seems
to
have
occurred
was
that
three
couple
of
hounds
jeremiah
regan
and
knox
equipage
amongst
them
somehow
hustled
the
cub
out
of
aussolas
demesne
and
up
on
to
a
hill
on
the
farther
side
of
the
road
jeremiah
was
sent
back
by
his
mistress
to
fetch
flurry
and
the
rest
of
the
party
pursued
a
thrilling
course
along
the
road
parallel
with
that
of
the
hounds
who
were
hunting
slowly
through
the
gorse
on
the
hillside
upon
my
honour
and
word
yeates
my
dear
we
have
the
hunt
to
ourselves
said
knox
to
the
panting
philippa
as
they
pounded
along
the
road
johnny
d
see
the
fox
i
do
shrieked
johnny
who
possessed
the
usual
vision
bestowed
upon
his
kind
look
at
him
us
on
the
hill
above
hi
the
spotty
dog
have
him
no
he
gone
from
him
out
o
this
to
the
donkey
with
blows
that
sounded
like
the
beating
of
carpets
and
produced
rather
more
dust
they
had
left
aussolas
some
half
a
mile
behind
when
from
a
strip
of
wood
on
their
right
the
fox
suddenly
slipped
over
the
bank
on
to
the
road
just
ahead
of
them
ran
up
it
for
a
few
yards
and
whisked
in
at
a
small
entrance
gate
with
the
three
couple
of
hounds
yelling
on
a
scent
not
thirty
yards
behind
the
party
whirled
in
at
their
heels
philippa
and
the
donkey
considerably
blown
johnny
scarlet
through
his
freckles
but
as
fresh
as
paint
the
old
lady
blind
and
deaf
to
all
things
save
the
chase
the
hounds
went
raging
through
the
shrubs
beside
the
drive
and
away
down
a
grassy
slope
towards
a
shallow
glen
in
the
bottom
of
which
ran
a
little
stream
and
after
them
over
the
grass
bumped
the
at
the
stream
they
turned
sharply
and
ran
up
the
glen
towards
the
avenue
which
crossed
it
by
means
of
a
rough
stone
viaduct
me
conscience
he
into
the
old
culvert
exclaimed
knox
there
was
one
of
my
hounds
choked
there
once
long
ago
beat
on
the
donkey
johnny
at
this
juncture
philippa
narrative
again
becomes
incoherent
not
to
say
breathless
she
is
however
positive
that
it
was
somewhere
about
here
that
the
upset
of
the
occurred
but
she
can
not
be
clear
as
to
whether
she
picked
up
the
donkey
or
knox
or
whether
she
herself
was
picked
up
by
johnny
while
knox
picked
up
the
donkey
from
my
knowledge
of
knox
i
should
say
she
picked
up
herself
and
no
one
else
at
all
events
the
next
salient
point
is
the
palpitating
moment
when
knox
johnny
and
philippa
successively
applying
an
eye
to
the
opening
of
the
culvert
by
which
the
stream
trickled
under
the
viaduct
while
five
dripping
hounds
bayed
and
leaped
around
them
discovered
by
more
senses
than
that
of
sight
that
the
fox
was
in
it
and
furthermore
that
one
of
the
hounds
was
in
it
too
there
a
sthrong
grating
before
him
at
the
far
end
said
johnny
his
head
in
at
the
mouth
of
the
hole
his
voice
sounding
as
if
he
were
talking
into
a
jug
the
two
of
them
fighting
in
it
they
be
choked
surely
then
do
stand
gabbling
there
you
little
fool
but
get
in
and
pull
the
hound
out
exclaimed
knox
who
was
balancing
herself
on
a
stone
in
the
stream
i
be
in
dread
whined
johnny
balderdash
said
the
implacable
knox
in
with
you
i
understand
that
philippa
assisted
johnny
into
the
culvert
and
presume
that
it
was
in
so
doing
that
she
acquired
the
two
robinson
crusoe
bare
footprints
which
decorated
her
jacket
when
i
next
met
her
have
you
got
hold
of
him
yet
johnny
cried
knox
up
the
culvert
i
have
by
the
tail
responded
johnny
voice
sepulchral
in
the
depths
can
you
stir
him
johnny
i
can
not
and
the
wather
is
rising
in
it
well
please
god
they
not
open
the
mill
dam
remarked
knox
philosophically
to
philippa
as
she
caught
hold
of
johnny
dirty
ankles
hold
on
to
the
tail
johnny
she
hauled
with
as
might
be
expected
no
appreciable
result
run
my
dear
and
look
for
somebody
and
we
have
that
fox
yet
philippa
ran
whither
she
knew
not
pursued
by
fearful
visions
of
bursting
and
maddened
foxes
at
bay
as
she
sped
up
the
avenue
she
heard
voices
robust
male
voices
in
a
shrubbery
and
made
for
them
advancing
along
an
embowered
walk
towards
her
was
what
she
took
for
one
wild
instant
to
be
a
funeral
a
second
glance
showed
her
that
it
was
a
party
of
clergymen
of
all
ages
walking
by
twos
and
threes
in
the
dappled
shade
of
the
trees
obviously
she
had
intruded
her
sacrilegious
presence
into
a
clerical
meeting
she
acknowledges
that
at
this
spectacle
she
faltered
but
the
thought
of
johnny
the
hound
and
the
fox
suffocating
possibly
drowning
together
in
the
culvert
nerved
her
she
does
not
remember
what
she
said
or
how
she
said
it
but
i
fancy
she
must
have
conveyed
to
them
the
impression
that
old
knox
was
being
drowned
as
she
immediately
found
herself
heading
a
charge
of
the
irish
church
towards
the
scene
of
disaster
fate
has
not
always
used
me
well
but
on
this
occasion
it
was
mercifully
decreed
that
i
and
the
other
members
of
the
hunt
should
be
privileged
to
arrive
in
time
to
see
my
wife
and
her
rescue
party
precipitating
themselves
down
the
glen
holy
biddy
ejaculated
flurry
is
she
running
a
with
all
the
parsons
but
look
for
pity
sake
will
you
look
at
my
grandmother
and
my
uncle
eustace
knox
and
her
sworn
enemy
the
old
clergyman
whom
i
had
met
at
dinner
the
night
before
were
standing
apparently
in
the
stream
tugging
at
two
bare
legs
that
projected
from
a
hole
in
the
viaduct
and
arguing
at
the
top
of
their
voices
the
lay
on
its
side
with
the
donkey
grazing
beside
it
on
the
bank
a
stout
archdeacon
was
tendering
advice
and
the
hounds
danced
and
howled
round
the
entire
group
i
tell
you
eliza
you
had
better
let
the
archdeacon
try
thundered
hamilton
then
i
tell
you
i
will
not
vociferated
knox
with
a
tug
at
the
end
of
the
sentence
that
elicited
a
subterranean
lament
from
johnny
now
who
was
right
about
the
second
grating
i
told
you
so
twenty
years
ago
exactly
as
philippa
and
her
rescue
party
arrived
the
efforts
of
knox
and
her
triumphed
the
struggling
sopping
form
of
johnny
was
slowly
drawn
from
the
hole
drenched
speechless
but
clinging
to
the
stern
of
a
hound
who
in
its
turn
had
its
jaws
fast
in
the
of
a
limp
yellow
cub
oh
it
dead
wailed
philippa
i
think
i
should
have
been
in
time
to
save
it
well
if
that
does
beat
all
said
hickey
vii
a
misdeal
the
wagonette
slewed
and
slackened
mysteriously
on
the
top
of
the
long
hill
above
drumcurran
so
many
remarkable
things
had
happened
since
we
had
entrusted
ourselves
to
the
guidance
of
bernard
shute
that
i
rose
in
my
place
and
possessed
myself
of
the
brake
and
in
so
doing
saw
the
horses
with
their
heads
hard
in
against
their
chests
and
their
quarters
jammed
crookedly
against
the
splashboard
being
apparently
tied
into
knots
by
some
inexplicable
power
some
one
pulling
the
reins
out
of
my
hand
exclaimed
shute
the
horses
and
pole
were
by
this
time
making
an
acute
angle
with
the
wagonette
and
the
groom
plunged
from
the
box
to
their
heads
miss
sally
knox
who
was
sitting
beside
me
looked
over
the
edge
put
on
the
brake
the
reins
are
twisted
round
the
axle
she
cried
and
fell
into
a
fit
of
laughter
we
all
that
is
to
say
philippa
miss
shute
miss
knox
and
i
got
out
as
speedily
as
might
be
but
i
think
without
panic
shute
alone
stuck
to
the
ship
with
the
horses
struggling
and
rearing
below
him
the
groom
and
i
contrived
to
back
them
and
by
so
doing
caused
the
reins
to
unwind
themselves
from
the
axle
it
was
my
fault
said
shute
hauling
them
in
as
fast
as
we
could
give
them
to
him
i
broke
the
reins
yesterday
and
these
are
the
phaeton
ones
and
about
six
fathoms
long
at
that
and
i
forgot
and
let
the
slack
go
overboard
it
all
right
i
wo
do
it
again
with
this
reassurance
we
confided
ourselves
once
more
to
the
wagonette
as
we
neared
the
town
of
drumcurran
the
fact
that
we
were
on
our
way
to
a
horse
fair
became
alarmingly
apparent
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
how
we
pursued
an
uninjured
course
through
the
companies
of
horsemen
the
crowded
carts
the
squealing
colts
the
irresponsible
led
horses
and
most
immutable
of
all
obstacles
the
groups
of
countrywomen
with
the
hoods
of
their
heavy
blue
cloaks
over
their
heads
they
looked
like
nuns
of
some
obscure
order
they
were
deaf
and
blind
as
ramparts
of
sandbags
nothing
less
callous
to
human
life
than
a
parisian
cabdriver
could
have
burst
a
way
through
them
many
times
during
that
drive
i
had
cause
to
be
thankful
for
the
sterling
qualities
of
shute
brake
with
its
aid
he
dragged
his
bays
into
a
crawl
that
finally
and
not
without
injury
to
the
varnish
took
the
wagonette
to
the
royal
hotel
every
available
stall
in
the
yard
was
by
that
time
filled
and
it
was
only
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
kitchenmaid
was
nearly
related
to
my
cook
that
the
indignant
groom
was
permitted
to
stable
the
bays
in
a
den
known
as
the
that
i
should
have
lent
myself
to
such
an
expedition
was
wholly
due
to
my
wife
since
philippa
had
taken
up
her
residence
in
ireland
she
had
discovered
a
taste
for
horses
that
was
not
to
be
extinguished
even
by
an
occasional
afternoon
on
the
quaker
whose
paces
had
become
harder
than
rock
in
his
many
journeys
to
petty
sessions
she
had
also
discovered
the
shutes
newcomers
on
the
outer
edge
of
our
vast
visiting
district
and
between
them
this
party
to
drumcurran
horse
fair
had
been
devised
philippa
proposed
to
buy
herself
a
hunter
bernard
shute
wished
to
do
the
same
possibly
two
hunters
money
being
no
difficulty
with
this
fortunate
young
man
miss
sally
knox
was
of
the
company
and
i
also
had
been
kindly
invited
as
to
a
missionary
meeting
to
come
and
bring
my
the
only
saving
clause
in
the
affair
was
the
fact
that
mr
flurry
knox
was
to
meet
us
at
the
scene
of
action
the
fair
was
held
in
a
couple
of
large
fields
outside
the
town
and
on
the
farther
bank
of
the
curranhilty
river
across
a
wide
and
glittering
ford
horses
of
all
sizes
and
sorts
were
splashing
and
a
long
row
of
was
hopped
and
staggered
and
scrambled
over
by
a
ceaseless
variety
of
a
man
with
a
cart
plied
as
a
ferry
boat
doing
a
heavy
trade
among
the
applewomen
and
vendors
of
crubeens
pigs
feet
a
grisly
delicacy
peculiar
to
irish
and
the
july
sun
blazed
on
a
scene
that
even
miss
cecilia
shute
found
to
be
almost
repayment
enough
for
the
alarms
of
the
drive
as
a
rule
i
am
so
bored
by
driving
that
i
find
it
reviving
to
be
frightened
she
said
to
me
as
we
climbed
to
safety
on
a
heathery
ridge
above
the
fields
dedicated
to
galloping
the
horses
but
when
my
brother
scraped
all
those
people
off
one
side
of
that
car
and
ran
the
pole
into
the
cart
of
i
began
to
wish
for
courage
to
tell
him
i
was
going
to
get
out
and
walk
home
well
if
you
only
knew
it
said
bernard
who
was
spreading
rugs
over
the
low
furze
bushes
in
the
touching
belief
that
the
prickles
would
not
come
through
the
time
you
came
nearest
to
walking
home
was
when
the
lash
of
the
whip
got
twisted
round
nancy
tail
miss
knox
you
an
authority
on
these
things
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
good
scheme
to
have
a
light
anchor
in
the
trap
and
when
the
horses
began
to
play
the
fool
you
heave
the
anchor
over
the
fence
and
bring
them
up
all
standing
they
would
stand
very
long
remarked
miss
sally
oh
that
all
right
returned
the
inventor
i
have
a
dodge
to
cast
them
loose
with
the
pole
and
the
you
never
see
them
again
responded
miss
knox
demurely
if
you
thought
that
mattered
it
would
be
the
brightest
feature
of
the
case
said
miss
shute
she
was
surveying
miss
sally
through
her
as
she
spoke
and
was
i
have
reason
to
believe
deciding
that
by
the
end
of
the
day
her
brother
would
be
well
on
in
the
first
stages
of
his
fifteenth
love
affair
it
has
possibly
been
suspected
that
bernard
shute
was
a
sailor
had
been
a
sailor
rather
until
within
the
last
year
when
he
had
tumbled
into
a
fortune
and
a
property
and
out
of
the
navy
in
the
shortest
time
on
record
his
enthusiasm
for
horses
had
been
nourished
by
the
hirelings
of
malta
and
other
resorts
of
her
majesty
ships
and
his
knowledge
of
them
was
so
far
bounded
by
the
fact
that
it
was
more
usual
to
come
off
over
their
heads
than
their
tails
for
the
rest
he
was
a
and
personable
youth
with
a
laugh
which
i
may
without
offensive
intention
define
as
possessing
a
special
to
his
profession
and
a
habit
engendered
no
doubt
by
long
sojourns
at
the
antipodes
of
getting
his
clothes
in
large
hideous
consignments
from
a
naval
outfitter
it
was
eleven
and
the
fair
was
in
full
swing
its
vortex
was
in
the
centre
of
the
field
below
us
where
a
low
bank
of
sods
and
earth
had
been
erected
as
a
trial
jump
with
a
yelling
crowd
of
men
and
boys
at
either
end
acting
instead
of
the
usual
wings
to
prevent
a
swerve
strings
of
reluctant
horses
were
scourged
over
the
bank
by
dozens
of
willing
hands
while
exhortation
cheers
and
criticism
were
freely
showered
upon
each
performance
give
the
knees
to
the
saddle
boy
and
leave
the
heels
slack
that
a
nice
horse
he
keep
a
jock
on
his
back
where
throw
him
well
jumped
begor
she
fled
that
fairly
as
an
ungainly
flounced
over
the
bank
without
putting
a
hoof
on
it
then
her
owner
unloosing
his
pride
in
simile
after
the
manner
of
his
race
ah
ha
when
she
give
a
lep
man
she
that
free
she
like
a
hare
for
it
a
giggling
group
of
country
girls
elbowed
their
way
past
us
out
of
the
crowd
of
spectators
one
of
the
number
inciting
her
fellows
to
hurry
on
to
the
other
field
until
they
see
the
lads
galloping
the
horses
to
which
another
responding
that
she
be
skinned
alive
for
the
horses
the
party
sped
on
their
way
we
my
wife
miss
knox
bernard
shute
and
myself
followed
in
their
wake
a
matter
by
no
means
as
easy
as
it
looked
miss
shute
had
exhibited
her
wonted
intelligence
by
remaining
on
the
hilltop
with
the
spectator
she
had
not
reached
the
happy
point
of
possessing
a
mind
ten
years
older
than
her
age
and
a
face
ten
years
younger
without
also
developing
the
gift
of
scenting
boredom
from
afar
we
squeezed
past
the
noses
and
heels
of
fidgety
horses
and
circumnavigated
their
attendant
groups
of
critics
while
brutes
in
snaffles
bolted
to
nowhere
and
back
again
and
whinnying
foals
ran
to
and
fro
in
search
of
their
mothers
a
moderate
bank
divided
the
upper
from
the
lower
fields
and
as
every
feasible
spot
in
it
was
commanded
by
a
refusing
horse
the
choice
of
a
place
and
moment
for
crossing
it
required
judgment
i
got
philippa
across
it
in
safety
miss
knox
though
as
capable
as
any
young
woman
in
ireland
of
getting
over
a
bank
either
on
horseback
or
on
her
own
legs
had
to
submit
to
the
assistance
of
shute
and
the
laws
of
dynamics
decreed
that
a
force
sufficient
to
raise
a
bower
anchor
should
hoist
her
seven
stone
odd
to
the
top
of
the
bank
with
such
speed
that
she
landed
half
on
her
knees
and
half
in
the
arms
of
her
pioneer
a
group
of
portentously
quiet
men
stood
near
their
eyes
on
the
ground
their
hands
in
their
pockets
they
were
all
dressed
so
much
alike
that
i
did
not
at
first
notice
that
flurry
knox
was
among
them
when
i
did
i
perceived
that
his
eyes
instead
of
being
on
the
ground
were
surveying
shute
with
that
measure
of
disapproval
that
he
habitually
bestowed
upon
strange
men
you
later
than
i
thought
you
be
he
said
i
have
a
horse
for
yeates
it
that
old
mare
of
bobby
bennett
she
makes
a
little
noise
but
she
a
good
mare
and
you
could
throw
her
down
if
you
tried
bobby
wants
thirty
pounds
for
her
but
i
think
you
might
get
her
for
less
she
in
the
hotel
stables
and
you
can
see
her
when
you
go
to
lunch
we
moved
on
towards
the
rushy
bank
of
the
river
and
philippa
and
sally
knox
seated
themselves
on
a
low
rock
looking
in
their
white
frocks
as
incongruous
in
that
dingy
preoccupied
assemblage
as
the
dreamy
and
purple
spires
of
loosestrife
that
thronged
the
river
banks
bernard
shute
had
been
lost
in
the
shifting
maze
of
men
and
horses
who
were
for
the
most
part
galloping
with
the
blind
fury
of
charging
bulls
but
presently
among
a
party
who
seemed
to
be
riding
the
finish
of
a
race
we
descried
our
friend
and
a
second
or
two
later
he
hauled
a
brown
mare
to
a
standstill
in
front
of
us
the
fellow
asking
pounds
for
her
he
said
to
miss
sally
she
a
nailer
to
gallop
i
do
think
it
too
much
her
grandsire
was
the
mountain
hare
said
the
owner
of
the
mare
hurrying
up
to
continue
her
family
history
and
he
was
the
grandest
horse
in
the
four
baronies
he
was
years
of
age
when
he
died
and
they
waked
him
the
same
as
ye
wake
a
christian
they
had
whisky
and
porther
and
bread
and
a
piper
in
it
thim
mountain
hare
colts
is
no
great
things
interrupted
groom
contemptuously
i
seen
a
colt
once
that
was
one
of
his
stock
and
if
there
was
forty
men
and
their
wives
and
they
after
him
with
sticks
he
would
lep
a
sod
of
turf
lep
is
it
ejaculated
the
owner
in
a
voice
shrill
with
outrage
you
may
lead
that
mare
out
through
the
counthry
and
there
is
a
fence
in
it
that
she
would
go
up
to
it
as
indepindent
as
if
she
was
going
to
her
bed
and
your
honour
ladyship
knows
that
dam
well
miss
knox
you
want
too
much
money
for
her
mccarthy
returned
miss
sally
with
her
little
air
of
preternatural
wisdom
god
pardon
you
miss
knox
sure
a
lady
like
you
knows
well
that
pounds
is
no
money
for
that
mare
pounds
he
laughed
it
be
as
good
for
me
to
make
her
a
present
to
the
gentleman
all
out
as
take
three
farthings
less
for
her
she
too
grand
entirely
for
a
poor
farmer
like
me
and
if
it
was
for
the
long
weak
family
i
have
i
would
part
with
her
under
twice
the
money
three
fine
lumps
of
daughters
in
america
paying
his
rent
for
him
commented
flurry
in
the
background
that
the
long
weak
family
bernard
dismounted
and
slapped
the
mare
ribs
approvingly
i
have
had
such
a
gallop
since
i
was
at
rio
he
said
what
do
you
think
of
her
miss
knox
then
without
waiting
for
an
answer
i
like
her
i
think
i
may
as
well
give
him
the
and
have
done
with
it
at
these
ingenuous
words
i
saw
a
spasm
of
anguish
cross
the
countenance
of
mccarthy
easily
interpreted
as
the
first
pang
of
a
regret
that
he
had
not
asked
twice
the
money
flurry
knox
put
up
an
eyebrow
and
winked
at
me
shute
groom
turned
away
for
very
shame
sally
knox
laughed
with
the
deplorable
levity
of
nineteen
thus
with
a
brevity
absolutely
scandalous
in
the
eyes
of
all
beholders
the
bargain
was
concluded
flurry
strolled
up
to
philippa
observing
an
elaborate
remoteness
from
miss
sally
and
shute
i
believe
i
selling
a
horse
here
myself
he
said
would
you
like
to
have
a
look
at
him
mrs
yeates
oh
are
you
selling
knox
struck
in
bernard
to
whose
brain
the
glory
of
buying
a
horse
had
obviously
mounted
like
new
wine
i
want
another
and
i
know
yours
are
the
right
sort
well
as
you
seem
fond
of
galloping
said
flurry
sardonically
this
one
might
suit
you
you
do
mean
the
moonlighter
said
miss
knox
looking
fixedly
at
him
supposing
i
did
have
you
anything
to
say
against
him
replied
flurry
decidedly
he
was
in
a
very
bad
temper
miss
sally
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
gave
a
little
shred
of
a
laugh
but
said
no
more
in
a
comparatively
secluded
corner
of
the
field
we
came
upon
moonlighter
sidling
and
fussing
with
flickering
ears
his
tail
tightly
tucked
in
and
his
strong
back
humped
in
a
manner
that
boded
little
good
even
to
my
untutored
eye
he
appeared
to
be
an
uncommonly
animal
a
grey
with
shoulders
that
raked
back
as
far
as
the
eye
could
wish
the
true
irish
jumping
hindquarters
and
a
showy
head
and
neck
it
was
obvious
that
nothing
except
michael
hallahane
adroit
chucks
at
his
bridle
kept
him
from
displaying
his
jumping
powers
free
of
charge
bernard
stared
at
him
in
silence
not
the
pregnant
and
intimidating
silence
of
the
connoisseur
but
the
muteness
of
helpless
ignorance
his
eye
for
horses
had
most
probably
been
formed
on
circus
posters
and
the
advertisements
of
a
embrocation
and
moonlighter
approximated
in
colour
and
conduct
to
these
models
i
can
see
he
a
ripping
fine
horse
he
said
at
length
i
think
i
should
like
to
try
him
miss
knox
changed
countenance
perceptibly
and
gave
a
perturbed
glance
at
flurry
flurry
remained
impenetrably
unamiable
i
do
pretend
to
be
a
judge
of
horses
went
on
shute
i
dare
say
i
need
tell
you
that
with
a
very
engaging
smile
at
miss
sally
but
i
like
this
one
awfully
as
even
philippa
said
afterwards
she
would
not
have
given
herself
away
like
that
over
buying
a
reel
of
cotton
are
you
quite
sure
that
he
really
the
sort
of
horse
you
want
said
miss
knox
with
rather
more
colour
in
her
face
than
usual
he
only
four
years
old
and
he
hardly
a
finished
hunter
the
object
of
her
philanthropy
looked
rather
puzzled
what
ca
he
jump
he
said
is
it
jump
exclaimed
michael
hallahane
unable
any
longer
to
contain
himself
is
it
the
horse
that
jumped
five
foot
of
a
clothes
line
in
heffernan
yard
and
not
a
one
on
his
back
but
himself
and
leave
so
much
as
the
thrack
of
his
hoof
on
the
quilt
that
was
hanging
on
it
that
about
good
enough
said
shute
with
his
large
friendly
laugh
what
your
price
knox
i
must
have
the
horse
that
jumped
the
quilt
i
like
to
try
him
if
you
do
mind
there
are
some
banks
over
there
my
price
is
a
hundred
sovereigns
said
flurry
you
can
try
him
if
you
like
oh
do
cried
sally
impulsively
but
bernard
foot
was
already
in
the
stirrup
i
call
it
disgraceful
i
heard
her
say
in
a
low
voice
to
her
kinsman
you
know
he
ca
ride
the
kinsman
permitted
himself
a
malign
smile
that
his
he
said
perhaps
the
unexpected
docility
with
which
moonlighter
allowed
himself
to
be
manoeuvred
through
the
crowd
was
due
to
bernard
thirteen
stone
at
all
events
his
progress
through
a
gate
into
the
next
field
was
unexceptionable
bernard
however
had
no
idea
of
encouraging
this
tranquillity
he
had
come
out
to
gallop
and
without
further
ceremony
he
drove
his
heels
into
moonlighter
sides
and
took
the
consequences
in
the
shape
of
a
very
fine
and
able
buck
how
he
remained
within
even
visiting
distance
of
the
saddle
it
is
impossible
to
explain
perhaps
his
early
experience
in
the
rigging
stood
him
in
good
stead
in
the
matter
of
hanging
on
by
his
hands
but
however
preserved
he
did
remain
and
went
away
down
the
field
at
what
he
himself
subsequently
described
as
the
rate
of
knots
flurry
flung
away
his
cigarette
and
ran
to
a
point
of
better
observation
we
all
ran
including
michael
hallahane
and
various
onlookers
and
were
in
time
to
see
shute
charging
the
least
advantageous
spot
in
a
furzy
bank
nothing
but
the
grey
horse
extreme
activity
got
the
pair
safely
over
he
jumped
it
on
a
slant
changed
feet
in
the
heart
of
a
and
was
lost
to
view
in
what
relative
positions
bernard
and
his
steed
alighted
was
to
us
a
matter
of
conjecture
when
we
caught
sight
of
them
again
moonlighter
was
running
away
with
his
rider
still
on
his
back
while
the
slope
of
the
ground
lent
wings
to
his
flight
that
young
gentleman
will
be
apt
to
be
killed
said
michael
hallahane
with
composure
not
to
say
enjoyment
he
be
into
the
long
bog
with
him
pretty
soon
said
flurry
his
keen
eye
tracking
the
fugitive
oh
i
thought
he
was
off
that
time
exclaimed
miss
sally
with
a
gasp
in
which
consternation
and
amusement
were
blended
there
he
into
the
bog
it
did
not
take
us
long
to
arrive
at
the
scene
of
disaster
to
which
as
to
a
other
were
already
hurrying
and
on
our
arrival
we
found
things
looking
remarkably
unpleasant
for
shute
and
moonlighter
the
latter
was
sunk
to
his
withers
in
the
sheet
of
black
slime
into
which
he
had
stampeded
the
former
submerged
to
the
waist
three
yards
farther
away
in
the
bog
was
trying
to
drag
himself
towards
firm
ground
by
the
aid
of
tussocks
of
wiry
grass
hit
him
shouted
flurry
hit
him
he
sink
if
he
stops
there
shute
turned
on
his
adviser
a
face
streaming
with
black
mud
out
of
which
his
brown
eyes
and
white
teeth
gleamed
with
undaunted
cheerfulness
all
jolly
fine
he
called
back
if
i
let
go
this
grass
i
sink
too
a
shout
of
laughter
from
the
male
portion
of
the
spectators
sympathetically
greeted
this
announcement
and
a
dozen
equally
futile
methods
of
escape
were
suggested
among
those
who
had
joined
us
was
fortunately
one
of
the
many
boys
who
pervaded
the
fair
selling
halters
and
by
means
of
several
of
these
knotted
together
a
line
of
communication
was
established
moonlighter
who
had
fallen
into
the
state
of
inane
stupor
in
which
horses
in
his
plight
so
often
indulge
was
roused
to
activity
by
showers
of
stones
and
imprecations
but
faintly
chastened
by
the
presence
of
ladies
bernard
hanging
on
to
his
tail
belaboured
him
with
a
cane
and
finally
the
reins
proving
good
the
task
of
towing
the
victims
ashore
was
achieved
he
mine
knox
you
know
were
shute
first
words
as
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
he
the
best
horse
i
ever
got
across
worth
twice
the
money
faith
he
aisy
plased
remarked
a
bystander
oh
do
go
and
borrow
some
dry
clothes
interposed
philippa
practically
surely
there
must
be
some
one
there
a
shop
in
the
town
where
he
can
strip
a
peg
for
said
flurry
grimly
i
would
care
myself
about
the
clothes
borrow
here
the
morning
sun
shone
jovially
upon
moonlighter
and
his
rider
caking
momently
the
black
bog
stuff
with
which
both
were
coated
and
as
the
group
disintegrated
and
we
turned
to
go
back
every
man
present
was
pleasurably
aware
that
the
buttons
of
shute
riding
breeches
had
burst
at
the
knee
causing
a
large
triangular
hiatus
above
his
gaiter
well
said
flurry
conclusively
to
me
as
we
retraced
our
steps
i
always
thought
the
fellow
was
a
fool
but
i
never
thought
he
was
such
a
damned
fool
it
seemed
an
interminable
time
since
breakfast
when
our
party
somewhat
shattered
by
the
stirring
events
of
the
morning
found
itself
gathered
in
an
upstairs
room
at
the
royal
hotel
waiting
for
a
meal
that
had
been
ordained
some
two
hours
before
the
air
was
charged
with
the
mingled
odours
of
boiling
cabbage
and
frying
mutton
we
affected
to
speak
of
them
with
disgust
but
our
souls
yearned
to
them
female
ministrants
with
rustling
skirts
and
pounding
feet
raced
along
the
passages
with
trays
that
were
never
for
us
and
opening
doors
released
roaring
gusts
of
conversation
blended
with
the
clatter
of
knives
and
forks
and
still
we
starved
even
the
check
suit
lately
labelled
the
sandringham
wonderful
value
in
the
window
of
drumcurran
leading
mart
and
now
displayed
upon
shute
all
too
lengthy
limbs
had
lost
its
power
to
charm
oh
do
tear
that
bell
quite
out
by
the
roots
bernard
said
his
sister
from
the
heart
of
a
lamentable
yawn
i
dare
say
it
only
amuses
them
when
we
ring
but
it
may
remind
them
that
we
are
still
alive
major
yeates
do
you
or
do
you
not
regret
the
pigs
feet
more
than
i
can
express
i
said
turning
from
the
window
where
i
had
been
looking
down
at
the
endless
succession
of
horses
backs
and
hats
moving
in
two
opposing
currents
in
the
street
below
i
dare
say
if
we
talk
about
them
for
a
little
we
shall
feel
ill
and
that
will
be
better
than
nothing
at
this
juncture
however
a
tray
thumped
against
the
door
and
our
repast
was
borne
into
the
room
by
a
hot
young
woman
in
creaking
boots
who
hoarsely
explained
that
what
kept
her
was
waiting
on
the
potatoes
and
that
the
ould
pan
that
was
in
it
was
playing
puck
with
the
beefsteaks
well
said
miss
shute
as
she
began
to
try
conclusions
between
a
blunt
knife
and
a
mutton
chop
i
have
never
lived
in
the
country
before
but
i
have
always
been
given
to
understand
that
the
village
inn
was
one
of
its
chief
attractions
she
delicately
moved
the
potato
dish
so
as
to
cover
the
traces
of
a
bygone
egg
and
her
glance
lingered
on
the
flies
that
dragged
their
way
across
a
melting
mound
of
salt
butter
i
like
local
colour
but
i
do
care
about
it
on
the
tablecloth
well
i
feeling
quite
anxious
about
irish
country
hotels
now
said
bernard
they
getting
so
civilised
and
respectable
after
all
when
you
go
back
to
england
no
one
cares
a
pin
to
hear
that
you
been
done
up
to
the
knocker
that
do
amuse
them
a
bit
but
all
my
friends
are
as
pleased
as
anything
when
i
tell
them
of
the
pothouse
where
i
slept
in
my
clothes
rather
than
face
the
sheets
or
how
when
i
complained
to
the
landlady
next
day
she
said
ye
up
was
it
his
reverence
the
dean
of
kilcoe
had
them
last
we
smiled
wanly
what
i
chiefly
felt
was
respect
for
any
hungry
man
who
could
jest
in
presence
of
such
a
meal
all
this
time
my
hunter
has
been
bought
said
philippa
presently
leaning
back
in
her
chair
and
abandoning
the
unequal
contest
with
her
beefsteak
who
is
bobby
bennett
will
his
horse
carry
a
lady
sally
knox
looked
at
me
and
began
to
laugh
you
should
ask
major
yeates
about
bobby
bennett
she
said
confound
miss
sally
it
had
never
seemed
worth
while
to
tell
philippa
all
that
story
about
my
doing
up
miss
bobby
bennett
hair
and
i
sank
my
face
in
my
tumbler
of
stagnant
to
conceal
the
colour
that
suddenly
adorned
it
any
intelligent
man
will
understand
that
it
was
a
situation
calculated
to
amuse
the
ungodly
but
without
any
real
fun
in
it
i
explained
miss
bennett
as
briefly
as
possible
and
at
all
the
more
critical
points
miss
sally
eyes
roamed
slowly
and
mercilessly
towards
me
you
have
told
yeates
that
she
one
of
the
greatest
in
the
country
she
said
when
i
had
got
through
somehow
she
can
sell
you
a
very
good
horse
sometimes
and
a
very
bad
one
too
if
she
gets
the
chance
no
one
will
ever
explain
to
me
said
miss
shute
scanning
us
all
with
her
dark
and
wholly
sophisticated
eyes
why
is
more
respectable
than
cheating
at
cards
i
rather
respect
people
who
are
able
to
cheat
at
cards
if
every
one
did
it
would
make
whist
so
much
more
cheerful
but
there
is
no
forgiveness
for
dealing
yourself
the
right
card
and
there
is
no
condemnation
for
dealing
your
neighbour
a
very
wrong
horse
your
neighbour
is
supposed
to
be
able
to
take
care
of
himself
said
bernard
well
why
does
that
apply
to
returned
his
sister
are
they
all
in
a
state
of
helpless
innocence
i
helplessly
innocent
announced
philippa
so
i
hope
miss
bennett
wo
deal
me
a
wrong
horse
oh
her
mare
is
one
of
the
right
ones
said
miss
sally
she
a
lovely
jumper
and
her
manners
are
the
very
best
the
door
opened
and
flurry
knox
put
in
his
head
bobby
downstairs
he
said
to
me
mysteriously
i
got
up
not
without
consciousness
of
miss
sally
eye
and
prepared
to
follow
him
you
better
come
too
yeates
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
do
let
him
give
her
more
than
thirty
and
if
he
gives
that
she
should
return
him
two
sovereigns
this
last
injunction
was
bestowed
in
a
whisper
as
we
descended
the
stairs
miss
bennett
was
in
the
crowded
yard
of
the
hotel
looking
handsome
and
overdressed
and
she
greeted
me
with
just
that
touch
of
auld
lang
syne
in
her
manner
that
i
could
best
have
dispensed
with
i
turned
to
the
business
in
hand
without
delay
the
brown
mare
was
led
forth
from
the
stable
and
paraded
for
our
benefit
she
was
one
of
those
inconspicuous
meritorious
animals
about
whom
there
seems
nothing
particular
to
say
and
i
felt
her
legs
and
looked
hard
at
her
hocks
and
was
not
much
the
wiser
it
no
use
my
saying
she
does
make
a
noise
said
miss
bobby
because
every
one
in
the
country
will
tell
you
she
does
you
can
have
a
vet
if
you
like
and
that
the
only
fault
he
can
find
with
her
but
if
yeates
has
hunted
before
now
i
guarantee
cruiskeen
as
just
the
thing
for
her
she
really
safe
and
confidential
my
little
brother
georgie
has
hunted
her
remember
georgie
major
yeates
the
night
of
the
ball
you
know
and
he
only
eleven
knox
can
tell
you
what
sort
she
is
oh
she
a
grand
mare
said
knox
thus
appealed
to
you
hear
her
coming
three
fields
off
like
a
german
band
and
well
for
you
if
you
could
keep
within
three
fields
of
her
retorted
miss
bennett
at
all
events
she
not
like
the
hunter
you
sold
uncle
that
used
to
kick
the
stars
as
soon
as
i
put
my
foot
in
the
stirrup
was
the
size
of
the
foot
frightened
him
said
flurry
do
you
know
how
uncle
cured
him
said
miss
bennett
turning
her
back
on
her
adversary
he
had
him
tied
head
and
tail
across
the
yard
gate
and
every
man
that
came
in
had
to
get
over
his
back
that
no
bad
one
said
flurry
philippa
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
bewilderment
while
the
badinage
continued
swift
and
unsmiling
as
became
two
hierarchs
of
it
went
on
at
intervals
for
the
next
ten
minutes
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
had
bought
the
mare
for
thirty
pounds
as
miss
bennett
said
nothing
about
giving
me
back
two
of
them
i
had
not
the
nerve
to
suggest
it
after
this
flurry
and
miss
bennett
went
away
and
were
swallowed
up
in
the
fair
we
returned
to
our
friends
upstairs
and
began
to
arrange
about
getting
home
this
among
other
difficulties
involved
the
tracking
and
capture
of
the
shutes
groom
and
took
so
long
that
it
necessitated
tea
bernard
and
i
had
settled
to
ride
our
new
purchases
home
and
the
groom
was
to
drive
the
wagonette
an
alteration
ardently
furthered
by
miss
shute
the
afternoon
was
well
advanced
when
bernard
and
i
struggled
through
the
turmoil
of
the
hotel
yard
in
search
of
our
horses
and
the
hotel
hostler
being
nowhere
to
be
found
the
man
saddled
our
animals
for
us
and
then
withdrew
to
grapple
with
the
bays
in
the
good
business
for
me
that
knox
is
sending
the
grey
horse
home
for
me
remarked
bernard
as
his
new
mare
followed
him
tractably
out
of
the
stall
he
have
been
rather
a
handful
in
this
hole
of
a
place
he
shoved
his
way
out
of
the
yard
in
front
of
me
seemingly
quite
comfortable
and
at
home
upon
the
descendant
of
the
mountain
hare
and
i
followed
as
closely
as
drunken
carmen
and
shafts
of
erratic
carts
would
permit
cruiskeen
evinced
a
decided
tendency
to
turn
to
the
right
on
leaving
the
yard
but
she
took
my
leftward
tug
in
good
part
and
we
moved
on
through
the
streets
of
drumcurran
with
a
dignity
that
was
only
impaired
by
the
irrepressible
determination
of
shute
new
trousers
to
run
up
his
leg
it
was
a
trifle
disappointing
that
cruiskeen
should
carry
her
nose
in
the
air
like
a
camel
but
i
set
it
down
to
my
own
bad
hands
and
to
that
cause
i
also
imputed
her
frequent
desire
to
stop
a
desire
that
appeared
to
coincide
with
every
fourth
or
fifth
on
the
line
of
march
indeed
at
the
last
corner
before
we
left
the
town
miss
bennett
mare
and
i
had
a
serious
difference
of
opinion
in
the
course
of
which
she
mounted
the
pavement
and
remained
planted
in
front
of
a
very
disreputable
whose
owner
had
been
before
me
several
times
for
various
infringements
of
the
licensing
acts
bernard
and
the
were
of
course
much
pleased
i
inwardly
resolved
to
let
miss
bennett
know
how
her
groom
occupied
his
time
in
drumcurran
we
got
out
into
the
calm
of
the
country
roads
without
further
incident
and
i
there
discovered
that
cruiskeen
was
possessed
of
a
dromedary
swiftness
in
trotting
that
the
action
was
about
as
comfortable
as
the
dromedary
and
that
it
was
extremely
difficult
to
moderate
the
pace
i
say
this
is
something
like
going
said
bernard
cantering
hard
beside
me
with
slack
rein
and
every
appearance
of
happiness
do
you
mean
to
keep
it
up
all
the
way
you
better
ask
this
devil
i
replied
hauling
on
the
futile
ring
snaffle
miss
bennett
must
have
an
arm
like
a
if
this
is
what
she
calls
confidential
i
do
want
her
confidences
after
another
during
which
i
cursed
flurry
knox
and
registered
a
vow
that
philippa
should
ride
cruiskeen
in
a
cavalry
bit
we
reached
the
at
which
bernard
way
parted
from
mine
another
difference
of
opinion
between
my
wife
hunter
and
me
here
took
place
this
time
on
the
subject
of
parting
from
our
companion
and
i
experienced
that
peculiar
inward
sinking
that
accompanies
the
birth
of
the
conviction
one
has
been
stuck
there
were
still
some
eight
miles
between
me
and
home
but
i
had
at
least
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
the
brown
mare
would
easily
cover
it
in
forty
minutes
but
in
this
also
disappointment
awaited
me
dropping
her
head
to
about
the
level
of
her
knees
the
mare
subsided
into
a
walk
as
slow
as
that
of
the
slowest
cow
and
very
similar
in
general
style
in
this
manner
i
progressed
for
a
further
mile
breathing
forth
like
paul
threatenings
and
slaughters
against
bobby
bennett
and
all
her
confederates
and
then
the
idea
occurred
to
me
that
many
really
hunters
were
very
poor
hacks
i
consoled
myself
with
this
for
a
further
period
and
presently
an
opportunity
for
testing
it
presented
itself
the
road
made
a
long
loop
round
the
flank
of
a
hill
and
it
was
possible
to
save
half
a
mile
or
so
by
getting
into
the
fields
it
was
a
short
cut
i
had
often
taken
on
the
quaker
and
it
involved
nothing
more
serious
than
a
couple
of
low
stone
gaps
and
an
infantine
bank
i
turned
cruiskeen
at
the
first
of
these
she
was
evidently
surprised
being
in
an
excessively
bad
temper
i
beat
her
in
a
way
that
surprised
her
even
more
and
she
jumped
the
stones
precipitately
and
with
an
ease
that
showed
she
knew
quite
well
what
she
was
about
i
vented
some
further
emotion
upon
her
by
the
convenient
medium
of
my
cane
and
galloped
her
across
the
field
and
over
the
bank
which
as
they
say
in
these
parts
she
fled
without
putting
an
iron
on
it
it
was
not
the
right
way
to
jump
it
but
it
was
inspiriting
and
when
she
had
disposed
of
the
next
gap
without
hesitation
my
waning
confidence
in
miss
bennett
began
to
revive
i
cantered
over
the
ridge
of
the
hill
and
down
it
towards
the
cottage
near
which
i
was
accustomed
to
get
out
on
to
the
road
again
as
i
neared
my
wonted
opening
in
the
fence
i
saw
that
it
had
been
filled
by
a
stout
pole
well
fixed
into
the
bank
at
each
end
but
not
more
than
three
feet
high
cruiskeen
pricked
her
ears
at
it
with
intelligence
i
trotted
her
at
it
and
gave
her
a
whack
ages
afterwards
there
was
some
one
speaking
on
the
blurred
edge
of
a
dream
that
i
was
dreaming
about
nothing
in
particular
i
went
on
dreaming
and
was
impressed
by
the
shape
of
a
fat
jug
mottled
white
and
blue
that
intruded
itself
painfully
and
i
again
heard
voices
very
urgent
and
full
of
effort
but
quite
outside
any
concern
of
mine
i
also
made
an
effort
of
some
kind
i
was
doing
my
very
best
to
be
good
and
polite
but
i
was
dreaming
in
a
place
that
whirred
and
was
engrossing
and
daylight
was
cold
and
let
in
some
unknown
unpleasantness
for
that
time
the
dream
got
the
better
of
the
daylight
and
then
of
nothing
i
was
standing
up
in
a
house
with
some
one
arm
round
me
the
mottled
jug
was
there
so
was
the
unpleasantness
and
i
was
talking
with
most
careful
politeness
sit
down
now
you
all
right
said
miss
bobby
bennett
who
was
mopping
my
face
with
a
handkerchief
dipped
in
the
jug
i
perceived
that
i
was
asking
what
had
happened
she
fell
over
the
stick
with
you
said
miss
bennett
the
dirty
brute
with
another
great
effort
i
hooked
myself
on
to
the
march
of
events
as
a
truck
is
dragged
out
of
a
siding
and
hooked
to
a
train
oh
the
lord
save
us
said
a
woman
who
held
the
jug
ye
desthroyed
entirely
asthore
oh
glory
be
to
the
merciful
will
of
god
me
heart
lepped
across
me
shesht
when
i
seen
him
undher
the
horse
go
out
and
see
if
the
trap
coming
said
miss
bennett
he
should
have
found
the
doctor
by
this
she
stared
very
closely
at
my
face
and
seemed
to
find
it
easier
to
talk
in
short
sentences
we
must
get
those
cuts
looking
better
before
yeates
comes
after
an
interval
during
which
unexpected
places
in
my
head
ached
from
the
cold
water
the
desire
to
be
polite
and
coherent
again
came
upon
me
i
am
sure
it
was
not
your
mare
fault
i
said
miss
bennett
laughed
a
very
little
i
was
glad
to
see
her
laugh
it
had
struck
me
her
face
was
strangely
haggard
and
frightened
well
of
course
it
was
poor
cruiskeen
fault
she
said
nearly
home
with
shute
by
now
that
why
i
came
after
you
mr
shute
i
said
was
he
at
the
fair
that
day
he
was
answered
miss
bobby
looking
at
me
with
very
compassionate
eyes
you
and
he
got
on
each
other
horses
by
mistake
at
the
hotel
and
you
got
the
worst
of
the
exchange
oh
i
said
without
even
trying
to
understand
he
here
within
your
honour
ladyship
yeates
shouted
the
woman
at
the
door
do
be
unaisy
achudth
doing
grand
sure
i
telling
miss
binnitt
if
she
was
his
wife
itself
she
could
give
him
betther
care
the
woman
laughed
viii
the
holy
island
for
three
days
of
november
a
white
fog
stood
motionless
over
the
country
all
day
and
all
night
smothered
booms
and
bangs
away
to
the
told
that
the
fastnet
gun
was
hard
at
work
and
the
sirens
of
the
american
liners
uplifted
their
monstrous
female
voices
as
they
felt
their
way
along
the
coast
of
cork
on
the
third
afternoon
the
wind
began
to
whine
about
the
windows
of
shreelane
and
the
barometer
fell
like
a
stone
at
the
storm
rushed
upon
us
with
the
roar
and
the
suddenness
of
a
train
the
chimneys
bellowed
the
tall
old
house
quivered
and
the
yelling
wind
drove
against
it
as
a
man
puts
his
shoulder
against
a
door
to
burst
it
in
we
none
of
us
got
much
sleep
and
if
cadogan
is
to
be
believed
which
experience
assures
me
she
is
not
she
spent
the
night
in
devotional
exercises
and
in
ministering
to
the
by
the
light
of
a
blessed
candle
all
that
day
the
storm
screamed
on
at
nightfall
the
rain
began
and
next
morning
which
happened
to
be
sunday
every
servant
in
the
house
was
a
messenger
of
job
laden
with
tales
of
leakages
floods
and
fallen
trees
and
inflated
with
the
glory
of
their
kind
in
evil
tidings
to
peter
cadogan
who
had
been
to
early
mass
was
reserved
the
crowning
satisfaction
of
reporting
that
a
big
vessel
had
gone
on
the
rocks
at
yokahn
point
the
evening
before
and
was
breaking
up
fast
it
was
rumoured
that
the
crew
had
got
ashore
but
this
feature
being
favourable
and
uninteresting
was
kept
as
much
as
possible
in
the
background
cadogan
who
had
been
to
america
in
an
ocean
liner
became
at
once
the
latest
authority
on
shipwrecks
and
was
of
opinion
that
whoever
would
be
dhrownded
it
would
be
thim
lads
o
sailors
sure
was
there
the
greatest
storm
ever
was
in
it
the
time
meself
was
on
the
say
and
what
thim
fellows
do
but
to
put
us
below
entirely
in
the
ship
and
close
down
the
doors
on
us
the
way
theirselves
leg
it
when
we
be
dhrownding
this
view
of
the
position
was
so
startlingly
novel
that
philippa
withdrew
suddenly
from
the
task
of
ordering
dinner
and
fell
up
the
kitchen
stairs
in
unsuitable
laughter
philippa
has
not
the
most
rudimentary
capacity
for
keeping
her
countenance
that
afternoon
i
was
wrapped
in
the
slumber
balmiest
and
most
profound
that
follows
on
a
wet
sunday
luncheon
when
murray
our
of
police
drove
up
in
uniform
and
came
into
the
house
on
the
top
of
a
gust
that
set
every
door
banging
and
every
picture
dancing
on
the
walls
he
looked
as
if
his
eyes
had
been
blown
out
of
his
head
and
he
wanted
something
to
eat
very
badly
i
been
down
at
the
wreck
since
ten
this
morning
he
said
waiting
for
her
to
break
up
and
once
she
does
there
be
trouble
she
an
american
ship
and
she
full
up
with
rum
and
bacon
and
butter
and
all
sorts
bosanquet
is
there
with
all
his
coastguards
and
there
are
five
hundred
country
people
on
the
strand
at
this
moment
waiting
for
the
fun
to
begin
i
got
ten
of
my
fellows
there
and
i
wish
i
had
as
many
more
you
better
come
back
with
me
yeates
we
may
want
the
riot
act
before
all
done
the
heavy
rain
had
ceased
but
it
seemed
as
if
it
had
fed
the
wind
instead
of
calming
it
and
when
murray
and
i
drove
out
of
shreelane
the
whole
dirty
sky
was
moving
full
sailed
in
from
the
and
the
telegraph
wires
were
hanging
in
a
loop
from
the
post
outside
the
gate
nothing
except
a
skebawn
would
have
faced
the
whooping
charges
of
the
wind
that
came
at
us
across
corran
lake
stimulated
mysteriously
by
whistles
from
the
driver
murray
yellow
hireling
pounded
woodenly
along
against
the
blast
till
the
smell
of
the
torn
was
borne
upon
it
and
we
saw
the
atlantic
waves
come
towering
into
the
bay
of
tralagough
the
ship
was
or
had
been
a
barque
two
of
her
masts
were
gone
and
her
bows
stood
high
out
of
water
on
the
reef
that
forms
one
of
the
jaws
of
the
bay
the
long
strand
was
crowded
with
black
groups
of
people
from
the
bank
of
heavy
shingle
that
had
been
hurled
over
on
to
the
road
down
to
the
slope
where
the
waves
pitched
themselves
and
climbed
and
fought
and
tore
the
gravel
back
with
them
as
though
they
had
dug
their
fingers
in
the
people
were
nearly
all
men
dressed
solemnly
and
hideously
in
their
sunday
clothes
most
of
them
had
come
straight
from
mass
without
any
dinner
true
to
that
irish
instinct
that
places
its
fun
before
its
food
that
the
wreck
was
regarded
as
a
spree
of
the
largest
kind
was
sufficiently
obvious
our
car
pulled
up
at
a
that
stood
askew
between
the
road
and
the
shingle
it
was
humming
with
those
whom
irish
publicans
are
pleased
to
call
bonâ
feeds
and
sundry
of
the
same
class
were
clustered
round
the
door
under
the
wall
on
the
was
seated
a
bagpiper
droning
out
the
irish
washerwoman
with
nodding
head
and
tapping
heel
and
a
young
man
was
cutting
a
few
steps
of
a
jig
for
the
delectation
of
a
group
of
girls
so
far
murray
constabulary
had
done
nothing
but
exhibit
their
imposing
chest
measurement
and
spotless
uniforms
to
the
atlantic
and
bosanquet
coastguards
had
only
salvaged
some
spars
the
debris
of
a
boat
and
a
dead
sheep
but
their
time
was
coming
as
we
stumbled
down
over
the
shingle
battered
by
the
wind
and
pelted
by
clots
of
foam
some
one
beside
me
shouted
she
gone
a
hill
of
water
had
smothered
the
wreck
and
when
it
fell
from
her
again
nothing
was
left
but
the
bows
with
the
bowsprit
hanging
from
them
in
a
tangle
of
rigging
the
clouds
bronzed
by
an
unseen
sunset
hung
low
over
her
in
that
greedy
pack
of
waves
with
the
remorseless
rocks
above
and
below
her
she
seemed
the
most
lonely
and
tormented
of
creatures
about
afterwards
the
cargo
began
to
come
ashore
on
the
top
of
the
rising
tide
barrels
were
plunging
and
diving
in
the
trough
of
the
waves
like
a
school
of
porpoises
they
were
pitched
up
the
beach
in
rushes
of
foam
they
rolled
down
again
and
were
swung
up
and
shouldered
by
the
next
wave
playing
a
kind
of
tom
tiddler
ground
with
the
coastguards
some
of
the
barrels
were
big
and
dangerous
some
were
small
and
nimble
like
young
pigs
and
the
bluejackets
were
up
to
their
middles
as
their
prey
dodged
and
ducked
and
the
police
lined
out
along
the
beach
to
keep
back
the
people
ten
men
of
the
can
do
a
great
deal
but
they
can
not
be
in
more
than
twenty
or
thirty
places
at
the
same
instant
therefore
they
could
hardly
cope
with
a
scattered
and
extremely
active
mob
of
four
or
five
hundred
many
of
whom
had
taken
advantage
of
their
privileges
as
travellers
and
all
of
whom
were
determined
on
getting
at
the
rum
as
the
dusk
fell
the
thing
got
more
and
more
out
of
hand
the
people
had
found
out
that
the
big
puncheons
held
the
rum
and
had
succeeded
in
capturing
one
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
it
was
broached
and
fifty
backs
were
shoving
round
it
like
a
football
scrummage
i
have
heard
many
rows
in
my
time
i
have
seen
two
irish
regiments
one
of
them
militia
at
each
other
throats
in
fermoy
barracks
i
have
heard
philippa
water
spaniel
and
two
hunting
a
strange
cat
round
the
dairy
but
never
have
i
known
such
untrammelled
bedlam
as
that
which
yelled
round
the
on
tralagough
strand
for
it
was
soon
not
a
question
of
one
broached
cask
or
even
of
two
the
barrels
were
coming
in
fast
so
fast
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
representatives
of
law
and
order
to
keep
on
any
sort
of
terms
with
them
the
people
shouting
with
laughter
stove
in
the
casks
and
drank
rum
at
above
proof
out
of
their
hands
out
of
their
hats
out
of
their
boots
women
came
fluttering
over
the
hillsides
through
the
twilight
carrying
jugs
anything
that
would
hold
the
liquor
i
saw
one
of
them
roaring
with
laughter
tilt
a
filthy
zinc
bucket
to
an
old
man
lips
with
the
darkness
came
anarchy
the
rising
tide
brought
more
and
yet
more
booty
great
spars
came
lunging
in
on
the
lap
of
the
waves
mixed
up
with
cabin
furniture
seamen
chests
and
the
black
and
slippery
barrels
and
the
country
people
continued
to
flock
in
and
the
drinking
became
more
and
more
unbridled
murray
sent
for
more
men
and
a
doctor
and
we
slaved
on
hopelessly
in
the
dark
collaring
men
shoving
casks
up
hills
of
shingle
hustling
in
among
groups
of
roaring
drinkers
we
rescued
perhaps
one
barrel
in
i
began
to
know
that
there
were
men
there
who
were
not
drunk
and
were
not
idle
i
was
also
aware
as
the
strenuous
hours
of
darkness
passed
of
an
occasional
rumble
of
cart
wheels
on
the
road
it
was
evident
that
the
casks
which
were
broached
were
the
least
part
of
the
looting
but
even
they
were
beyond
our
control
the
most
that
bosanquet
murray
and
i
could
do
was
to
concentrate
our
forces
on
the
casks
that
had
been
secured
and
to
organise
charges
upon
the
swilling
crowds
in
order
to
upset
the
casks
that
they
had
broached
already
men
and
boys
were
lying
about
limp
as
leeches
motionless
as
the
dead
they
kill
themselves
before
morning
at
this
rate
shouted
murray
to
me
they
drinking
it
by
the
quart
here
another
barrel
come
on
we
rallied
our
small
forces
and
after
a
brief
but
furious
struggle
succeeded
in
capsizing
it
it
poured
away
in
a
flood
over
the
stones
over
the
prostrate
figures
that
sprawled
on
them
and
a
howl
of
reproach
followed
if
ye
pour
away
any
more
o
that
major
said
an
unctuous
voice
in
my
ear
ye
intoxicate
the
stones
and
they
be
getting
up
and
knocking
us
down
i
had
been
aware
of
a
fat
shoulder
next
to
mine
in
the
throng
as
we
heaved
the
puncheon
over
and
i
now
recognised
the
ponderous
wit
and
falstaffian
figure
of
james
canty
a
noted
member
of
the
skebawn
board
of
guardians
and
the
owner
of
a
large
farm
near
at
hand
i
never
saw
worse
work
on
this
strand
he
went
on
i
considher
these
debaucheries
a
disgrace
to
the
counthry
canty
was
famous
as
an
orator
and
i
presume
that
it
was
from
long
practice
among
his
fellow
that
he
was
able
without
apparent
exertion
to
the
storm
at
this
juncture
the
reinforcements
arrived
and
along
with
them
came
jerome
hickey
armed
with
a
black
bag
having
mentioned
that
the
bag
contained
a
pump
not
one
of
the
common
or
garden
variety
and
that
no
pump
on
board
a
foundering
ship
had
more
arduous
labours
to
perform
i
prefer
to
pass
to
other
themes
the
wreck
which
had
at
first
appeared
to
be
as
inexhaustible
and
as
variously
stocked
as
that
in
the
swiss
family
robinson
was
beginning
to
fail
in
its
supply
the
crowd
were
by
this
time
for
the
most
part
incapable
from
drink
and
the
fresh
contingent
of
police
tackled
their
work
with
some
prospect
of
success
by
the
light
of
a
tar
barrel
contributed
by
the
owner
of
the
at
about
the
same
time
i
began
to
be
aware
that
i
was
aching
with
fatigue
that
my
clothes
hung
heavy
and
soaked
upon
me
that
my
face
was
stiff
with
the
salt
spray
and
the
bitter
wind
and
that
it
was
two
hours
past
the
possibility
of
fried
salt
herrings
and
hot
whisky
and
water
at
the
rose
dazzlingly
before
my
mind
when
canty
again
crossed
my
path
in
my
opinion
ye
have
the
whole
cargo
under
conthrol
now
major
he
said
and
the
police
and
the
sailors
should
be
able
to
account
for
it
all
now
by
the
help
of
the
light
was
i
the
finished
fool
that
i
did
think
to
send
up
to
my
house
for
a
tar
barrel
before
now
well
we
all
foolish
sometimes
but
indeed
it
time
for
us
to
give
over
and
that
what
i
after
saying
to
the
captain
and
murray
you
exhausted
now
the
three
of
ye
and
if
i
might
make
so
bold
suggest
that
ye
come
up
to
my
little
place
and
have
what
warm
ye
before
ye
go
home
it
only
a
few
perches
up
the
road
the
tide
had
turned
the
rain
had
begun
again
and
the
tar
barrel
illumined
the
fact
that
hickey
dreadful
duties
alone
were
pressing
we
held
a
council
and
finally
followed
canty
picking
our
way
through
wreckage
of
all
kinds
including
the
human
variety
near
the
i
stumbled
over
something
that
was
soft
and
had
a
squeak
in
it
it
was
the
piper
with
his
head
and
shoulders
in
an
overturned
and
the
bagpipes
still
under
his
arm
i
knew
the
outward
appearance
of
canty
house
very
well
it
was
a
typical
southern
with
dirty
whitewashed
walls
a
slated
roof
and
small
windows
staring
at
the
morass
of
manure
which
constituted
the
yard
we
followed
canty
up
the
filthy
lane
that
led
to
it
picked
our
way
round
vague
and
squelching
spurs
of
the
manure
heap
and
were
finally
led
through
the
kitchen
into
a
stifling
best
parlour
canty
a
vast
and
slatternly
matron
had
evidently
made
preparations
for
us
there
was
a
fire
pouring
flame
up
the
chimney
from
layers
of
bogwood
there
were
whisky
and
brandy
on
the
table
and
a
plateful
of
biscuits
sugared
in
white
and
pink
upon
our
hostess
was
a
black
silk
dress
which
indifferently
concealed
the
fact
that
she
was
short
of
and
that
the
boots
themselves
had
made
many
excursions
to
the
yard
and
none
to
the
her
manners
however
were
admirable
and
while
i
live
i
shall
not
forget
her
potato
cakes
they
came
in
hot
and
hot
from
a
they
were
speckled
with
caraway
seeds
they
swam
in
salt
butter
and
we
ate
them
shamelessly
and
greasily
and
washed
them
down
with
hot
whisky
and
water
i
knew
to
a
nicety
how
ill
i
should
be
next
day
and
heeded
not
well
gentlemen
remarked
canty
later
on
in
his
best
board
of
guardians
manner
i
seen
many
wrecks
between
this
and
the
mizen
head
but
i
never
witnessed
a
scene
of
more
disgraceful
than
what
was
in
it
hear
hear
murmured
bosanquet
with
unseemly
levity
i
should
say
went
on
canty
there
was
at
one
time
upwards
of
one
hundhred
men
dead
dhrunk
on
the
strand
or
anyway
so
dhrunk
that
if
they
attempt
to
spake
they
foam
at
the
mouth
the
craytures
interjected
canty
sympathetically
but
if
they
dhrunk
continued
our
host
it
nothing
at
all
to
what
they
be
and
afther
and
it
wo
be
on
the
strand
they
be
dhrinkin
it
why
where
will
it
be
said
bosanquet
with
his
disconcerting
english
way
of
asking
a
question
canty
passed
his
hand
over
his
red
cheeks
there
be
plenty
asking
that
before
all
said
and
done
captain
he
said
with
a
compassionate
smile
and
there
be
plenty
that
could
give
the
answer
if
they
like
but
by
dam
i
do
think
ye
be
apt
to
get
much
out
of
the
yokahn
boys
the
lord
save
us
be
better
to
keep
out
from
the
likes
thim
put
in
canty
sliding
a
fresh
avalanche
of
potato
cakes
on
to
the
dish
did
they
pull
the
clothes
off
the
gauger
and
pour
potheen
down
his
throath
till
he
ran
screeching
through
the
streets
skebawn
james
canty
chuckled
i
remember
there
was
a
wreck
here
one
time
and
the
undherwriters
put
me
in
charge
of
the
cargo
brandy
it
was
cases
of
the
best
frinch
brandy
the
people
had
a
song
about
it
what
this
the
first
verse
was
one
night
to
the
rocks
of
yokahn
came
the
barque
so
dandy
to
pieces
she
went
before
dawn
herself
and
her
cargo
of
brandy
and
all
met
a
wathery
grave
excepting
the
vessel
poor
fellow
so
far
from
his
home
canty
chanted
these
touching
lines
in
a
tuneful
if
wheezy
tenor
well
gentlemen
we
all
friends
here
he
continued
and
it
no
harm
to
mention
that
this
man
below
at
the
came
askin
me
would
i
let
him
have
some
of
it
for
a
consideration
says
i
to
him
ye
ran
down
gold
in
a
cup
in
place
of
the
brandy
i
would
give
it
to
you
of
coorse
says
i
not
sayin
but
that
if
a
bottle
was
to
get
a
crack
of
a
stick
and
it
to
be
broken
and
a
man
to
drink
a
glass
out
of
it
that
would
be
no
more
than
an
accident
no
good
to
me
says
he
if
i
had
twelve
gallons
of
that
brandy
in
cork
says
he
the
holy
german
says
he
saying
an
awful
curse
sell
out
of
it
well
indeed
it
was
true
for
him
it
was
grand
stuff
as
the
saying
is
it
would
make
a
horse
out
of
a
cow
it
appears
to
be
a
handy
sort
of
place
for
keeping
a
pub
said
bosanquet
shut
to
the
door
margaret
said
canty
with
elaborate
caution
it
be
a
queer
place
that
would
be
handy
for
sullivan
a
further
tale
of
great
length
was
in
progress
when
mephistophelian
nose
was
poked
into
the
best
parlour
hullo
hickey
pumped
out
eh
said
murray
if
i
am
there
plenty
more
like
me
replied
the
doctor
enigmatically
and
some
of
them
three
times
over
james
did
these
gentlemen
leave
you
a
drop
of
anything
that
you
offer
me
maybe
ye
like
a
glass
of
rum
doctor
said
canty
with
a
wink
at
his
other
guests
hickey
shuddered
i
had
next
morning
precisely
the
kind
of
mouth
that
i
had
anticipated
and
it
being
my
duty
to
spend
the
better
part
of
the
day
administering
justice
in
skebawn
i
received
from
mr
flurry
knox
and
other
of
my
brother
magistrates
precisely
the
class
of
condolences
on
my
monday
head
that
i
found
least
amusing
it
was
unavailing
to
point
out
the
resemblance
between
hot
potato
cakes
and
molten
lead
or
to
dilate
on
their
equal
power
of
solidifying
the
collective
wisdom
of
the
bench
decided
that
i
was
suffering
from
contraband
rum
and
rejoiced
over
me
accordingly
during
the
next
three
weeks
murray
and
bosanquet
put
in
a
time
only
to
be
equalled
by
that
of
the
heroes
in
detective
romances
they
began
by
acting
on
the
hint
offered
by
canty
and
were
rewarded
by
finding
eight
barrels
of
bacon
and
three
casks
of
rum
in
the
heart
of
sullivan
turf
rick
placed
there
so
sullivan
explained
with
much
detail
by
enemies
with
the
object
of
getting
his
licence
taken
away
they
stabbed
potato
gardens
with
crowbars
to
find
the
buried
barrels
they
explored
the
chimneys
they
raided
the
and
in
every
possible
and
impossible
place
they
found
some
of
the
cargo
of
the
late
barque
and
as
the
sympathetic
canty
said
for
as
much
as
they
found
they
left
five
times
as
much
afther
them
it
was
a
wet
lingering
autumn
but
towards
the
end
of
november
the
rain
dried
up
the
weather
stiffened
and
a
week
of
light
frosts
and
blue
skies
was
offered
as
a
tardy
apology
philippa
possesses
in
common
with
many
of
her
sex
an
inappeasable
passion
for
picnics
and
her
ingenuity
for
devising
occasions
for
them
is
only
equalled
by
her
gift
for
enduring
their
rigours
i
have
seen
her
tackle
a
moist
chicken
pie
with
a
splinter
of
slate
and
my
stylograph
pen
i
have
known
her
to
take
the
to
an
auction
and
make
tea
in
a
inside
car
regardless
of
the
fact
that
it
was
coming
under
the
hammer
in
ten
minutes
and
that
the
kettle
took
twenty
minutes
to
boil
it
will
therefore
be
readily
understood
that
the
rare
occasions
when
i
was
free
to
go
out
with
a
gun
were
not
allowed
to
pass
uncelebrated
by
the
you
much
better
shoot
corran
lake
my
wife
said
to
me
one
brilliant
afternoon
we
could
send
the
punt
over
and
i
could
meet
you
on
holy
island
with
the
rest
of
the
sentence
was
concerned
with
ways
means
and
the
and
need
not
be
recorded
i
had
taken
the
shooting
of
a
long
snipe
bog
that
trailed
from
corran
lake
almost
to
the
sea
at
tralagough
and
it
was
my
custom
to
begin
to
shoot
from
the
seaward
end
of
it
and
finally
to
work
round
the
lake
after
duck
proved
a
heavenly
morning
touched
with
frost
gilt
with
sun
i
started
early
and
the
mists
were
still
smoking
up
from
the
calm
lake
as
the
quaker
stepped
out
along
the
level
road
smashing
the
thin
ice
on
the
puddles
with
his
big
feet
behind
the
calves
of
my
legs
sat
maria
philippa
brown
irish
assiduously
licking
the
barrels
of
my
gun
as
was
her
custom
when
the
ecstasy
of
going
out
shooting
was
hers
maria
had
been
given
to
philippa
as
a
and
since
then
it
had
been
my
ambition
that
she
should
conform
to
the
beth
gelert
standard
of
being
a
lamb
at
home
a
lion
in
the
chase
maria
did
pretty
well
as
a
lion
she
hunted
all
dogs
unmistakably
smaller
than
herself
and
whenever
it
was
reasonably
possible
to
do
so
she
devoured
the
spoils
of
the
chase
notably
jack
snipe
it
was
as
a
lamb
that
she
failed
objectionable
as
i
have
no
doubt
a
lamb
would
be
as
a
domestic
pet
it
at
least
would
not
snatch
the
cold
beef
from
the
nor
yet
if
banished
for
its
crimes
would
it
spend
the
night
in
scratching
the
paint
off
the
hall
door
maria
bit
beggars
who
valued
their
disgusting
limbs
at
five
shillings
the
square
inch
she
bullied
the
servants
she
concealed
ducks
claws
and
fishes
backbones
behind
the
sofa
cushions
and
yet
when
she
laid
her
brown
snout
upon
my
knee
and
rolled
her
blackguard
amber
eyes
upon
me
and
smote
me
with
her
feathered
paw
it
was
impossible
to
remember
her
iniquities
against
her
on
shooting
mornings
maria
ceased
to
be
a
buccaneer
a
glutton
and
a
hypocrite
from
the
moment
when
i
put
my
gun
together
her
breakfast
stood
untouched
until
it
suffered
the
final
degradation
of
being
eaten
by
the
cats
and
now
in
the
trap
she
was
shivering
with
excitement
and
agonising
in
her
soul
lest
she
should
even
yet
be
left
behind
slipper
met
me
at
the
cross
roads
from
which
i
had
sent
back
the
trap
slipper
redder
in
the
nose
than
anything
i
had
ever
seen
off
the
stage
very
husky
as
to
the
voice
and
going
rather
tender
on
both
feet
he
informed
me
that
i
should
have
a
grand
day
shooting
the
of
the
locality
having
in
a
most
gentlemanlike
manner
refrained
from
exercising
his
sporting
rights
the
day
before
on
hearing
that
i
was
coming
i
understood
that
this
was
to
be
considered
as
a
mark
of
high
personal
esteem
and
i
set
to
work
at
the
bog
with
suitable
gratitude
in
spite
of
magnanimity
i
had
not
a
very
good
morning
the
snipe
were
there
but
in
the
perfect
stillness
of
the
weather
it
was
impossible
to
get
near
them
and
five
times
out
of
six
they
were
up
flickering
and
dodging
before
i
was
within
shot
maria
became
possessed
of
seven
devils
and
broke
away
from
heel
the
first
time
i
let
off
my
gun
ranging
far
and
wide
in
search
of
the
bird
i
had
missed
and
putting
up
every
live
thing
for
half
a
mile
round
as
she
went
splashing
and
through
the
bog
slipper
expressed
his
opinion
of
her
behaviour
in
language
more
appallingly
picturesque
and
resourceful
than
any
i
have
heard
even
in
the
skebawn
courthouse
i
admit
that
at
the
time
i
thought
he
spoke
very
suitably
before
she
was
recaptured
every
remaining
snipe
within
earshot
was
lifted
out
of
it
by
slipper
whistles
and
my
own
infuriated
bellows
it
was
fortunate
that
the
bog
was
spacious
and
that
there
was
still
a
long
tract
of
it
ahead
where
beyond
these
voices
there
was
peace
i
worked
my
way
on
jumping
drains
floundering
through
the
rustling
yellow
rushes
circumnavigating
the
and
taking
every
possible
and
impossible
chance
of
a
shot
by
the
time
i
had
reached
corran
lake
i
had
got
two
and
a
half
brace
retrieved
by
maria
with
a
perfection
that
showed
what
her
powers
were
when
the
sinuous
adroitness
of
slipper
woodbine
stick
was
fresh
in
her
mind
but
with
maria
it
was
always
the
unexpected
that
happened
my
last
snipe
a
jack
fell
in
the
lake
and
maria
bursting
through
the
reeds
with
kangaroo
bounds
and
cleaving
the
water
like
a
was
a
model
of
all
the
virtues
of
her
kind
she
picked
up
the
bird
with
a
dart
of
her
head
clambered
with
it
on
to
a
tussock
and
there
well
out
of
reach
of
the
arm
of
the
law
before
our
indignant
eyes
crunched
it
twice
and
bolted
it
well

some
ten
minutes
afterwards

however
composing
slipper
methods
may
have
been
to
knox
they
had
quite
the
contrary
effect
upon
a
family
party
of
duck
that
had
been
lying
in
the
reeds
with
horrified
outcries
they
broke
into
flight
and
now
were
far
away
on
the
ethereal
mirror
of
the
lake
among
strings
of
their
fellows
that
were
floating
and
quacking
in
preoccupied
indifference
to
my
presence
a
promenade
along
the
demonstrated
the
fact
that
without
a
boat
there
was
no
more
shooting
for
me
i
looked
across
to
the
island
where
some
time
ago
i
had
seen
philippa
and
her
punt
arrive
the
boat
was
tied
to
an
overhanging
tree
but
my
wife
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
i
was
opening
my
mouth
to
give
a
hail
when
i
saw
her
emerge
precipitately
from
among
the
trees
and
jump
into
the
boat
philippa
had
not
in
vain
spent
many
summers
on
the
thames
she
was
under
way
in
a
twinkling
sculled
a
score
of
strokes
at
the
rate
of
a
finish
then
stopped
and
stared
at
the
peaceful
island
i
called
to
her
and
in
a
minute
or
two
the
punt
had
crackled
through
the
reeds
and
shoved
its
blunt
nose
ashore
at
the
spot
where
i
was
standing
sinclair
said
philippa
in
tones
there
something
on
the
island
i
hope
there
something
to
eat
there
said
i
i
tell
you
there
something
there
alive
said
my
wife
with
her
eyes
as
large
as
saucers
it
making
an
awful
sound
like
snoring
that
the
fairies
said
slipper
with
complete
certainty
sure
i
known
them
that
seen
fairies
in
that
island
as
thick
as
the
grass
and
every
one
o
them
with
little
caps
on
them
philippa
wide
gaze
wandered
to
slipper
hideous
pug
face
and
back
to
me
it
was
not
a
human
being
sinclair
she
said
combatively
though
i
had
not
uttered
a
word
maria
had
already
after
the
manner
of
dogs
leaped
dripping
into
the
boat
i
prepared
to
follow
her
example
major
said
slipper
in
a
tragic
whisper
there
was
a
man
was
a
night
on
that
island
one
time
watching
duck
and
thim
people
cot
him
and
dhragged
him
through
hell
and
through
death
and
threw
him
in
the
tide
shove
off
the
boat
i
said
too
hungry
for
argument
slipper
obeyed
throwing
his
knee
over
the
gunwale
as
he
did
so
and
tumbling
into
the
bow
we
could
have
done
without
him
very
comfortably
but
his
devotion
was
touching
holy
island
was
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
long
and
about
half
as
many
broad
it
was
covered
with
trees
and
a
dense
growth
of
rhododendrons
somewhere
in
the
jungle
was
a
ruined
fragment
of
a
chapel
smothered
in
ivy
and
briars
and
in
a
little
glade
in
the
heart
of
the
island
there
was
a
holy
well
we
landed
and
it
was
obviously
a
sore
humiliation
to
philippa
that
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
in
the
silence
of
the
island
save
the
cough
of
a
heron
on
a
it
there
she
said
with
an
unconvinced
glance
at
the
surrounding
thickets
sure
i
give
a
thrawl
through
the
island
volunteered
slipper
with
unexpected
gallantry
an
if
it
the
divil
himself
is
in
it
i
rattle
him
into
the
lake
he
went
swaggering
on
his
search
shouting
hi
cock
and
whacking
the
rhododendrons
with
his
stick
and
after
an
interval
returned
and
assured
us
that
the
island
was
uninhabited
being
provided
with
refreshments
he
again
withdrew
and
philippa
and
maria
and
i
fed
variously
and
at
great
length
and
washed
the
plates
with
water
from
the
holy
well
i
was
smoking
a
cigarette
when
we
heard
slipper
addressing
the
solitudes
at
the
farther
end
of
the
island
and
ending
with
one
of
his
crows
of
laughter
he
presently
came
lurching
towards
us
through
the
bushes
and
a
glance
sufficed
to
show
even
philippa
who
was
as
incompetent
a
judge
of
such
matters
as
many
of
her
sex
that
he
was
undeniably
screwed
major
yeates
he
began
and
major
yeates
with
respex
to
ye
i
bastely
dhrunk
me
head
is
light
since
the
and
the
docthor
told
me
i
should
carry
a
little
o
sperrits
look
here
i
said
to
philippa
i
take
him
across
and
bring
the
boat
back
for
you
sinclair
responded
my
wife
with
concentrated
emotion
i
would
rather
die
than
stay
on
this
island
alone
slipper
was
getting
drunker
every
moment
but
i
managed
to
stow
him
on
his
back
in
the
bows
of
the
punt
in
which
position
he
at
once
began
to
uplift
husky
and
wandering
strains
of
melody
to
this
accompaniment
we
as
tennyson
says
moved
from
the
brink
like
some
swan
that
fluting
a
wild
carol
ere
her
death
ruffles
her
pure
cold
plume
and
takes
the
flood
with
swarthy
web
slipper
would
certainly
have
been
none
the
worse
for
taking
the
flood
and
as
the
burden
of
lannigan
ball
strengthened
and
spread
along
the
tranquil
lake
and
the
duck
once
more
fled
in
justifiable
consternation
i
felt
much
inclined
to
make
him
do
so
we
made
for
the
end
of
the
lake
that
was
nearest
shreelane
and
as
we
rounded
the
point
of
the
island
another
boat
presented
itself
to
our
view
it
contained
my
late
entertainer
canty
seated
bulkily
in
the
stern
while
a
small
boy
bowed
himself
between
the
two
heavy
oars
it
a
lovely
evening
major
yeates
she
called
out
i
just
going
to
the
island
to
get
some
water
from
the
holy
well
for
me
daughter
that
has
an
impression
on
her
chest
indeed
i
thought
was
yourself
was
singing
a
song
for
yeates
when
i
heard
you
coming
but
sure
slipper
is
a
great
warrant
himself
for
singing
may
the
divil
crack
the
two
legs
undher
ye
bawled
slipper
in
acknowledgment
of
the
compliment
canty
laughed
genially
and
her
boat
lumbered
away
i
shoved
slipper
ashore
at
the
nearest
point
philippa
and
i
paddled
to
the
end
of
the
lake
and
abandoning
the
duck
as
a
bad
business
walked
home
a
few
days
afterwards
it
happened
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
me
to
attend
the
funeral
of
the
roman
catholic
bishop
of
the
diocese
it
was
what
is
called
in
france
bel
with
inky
flocks
of
priests
and
countless
yards
of
white
scarves
and
a
repast
of
monumental
solidity
at
the
bishop
residence
the
actual
interment
was
to
take
place
in
cork
and
we
moved
in
long
and
imposing
procession
to
the
railway
station
where
a
special
train
awaited
the
cortège
my
friend
james
canty
was
among
the
mourners
an
important
and
active
personage
exchanging
condolences
with
the
priests
giving
directions
to
porters
and
blowing
his
nose
with
a
trumpeting
mournfulness
that
penetrated
all
the
other
noises
of
the
platform
he
was
condescending
enough
to
notice
my
presence
and
found
time
to
tell
me
that
he
had
given
murray
a
sure
word
with
regard
to
some
of
this
with
deep
significance
and
a
wink
of
an
inflamed
and
tearful
eye
i
saw
him
depart
in
a
carriage
and
the
odour
of
sanctity
seeing
that
he
was
accompanied
by
seven
priests
and
that
both
windows
were
shut
the
latter
must
have
been
considerable
afterwards
in
the
town
i
met
murray
looking
more
pleased
with
himself
than
i
had
seen
him
since
he
had
taken
up
the
unprofitable
task
of
come
along
and
have
some
lunch
he
said
i
got
a
real
good
thing
on
this
time
that
chap
canty
came
to
me
late
last
night
and
told
me
that
he
knew
for
a
fact
that
the
island
on
corran
lake
was
just
stiff
with
barrels
of
bacon
and
rum
and
that
i
better
send
every
man
i
could
spare
to
get
them
into
the
town
i
sent
the
men
out
at
eight
this
morning
i
think
i
gone
one
better
than
bosanquet
this
time
i
began
to
realise
that
philippa
was
going
to
score
heavily
on
the
subject
of
the
fairies
that
she
had
heard
snoring
on
the
island
and
i
imparted
to
murray
the
leading
features
of
our
picnic
there
oh
slipper
been
up
to
his
chin
in
that
rum
from
the
first
said
murray
i
like
to
know
who
his
sleeping
partner
was
it
was
beginning
to
get
dark
before
the
loaded
carts
of
the
salvage
party
came
lumbering
past
murray
windows
and
into
the
yard
of
the
we
followed
them
and
in
so
doing
picked
up
flurry
knox
who
was
sauntering
in
the
same
direction
it
was
a
good
haul
five
big
casks
of
rum
and
at
least
a
dozen
smaller
barrels
of
bacon
and
butter
and
murray
and
his
chief
constable
smiled
seraphically
on
one
another
as
the
spoil
was
unloaded
and
stowed
in
a
shed
would
it
be
as
well
to
see
how
the
butter
is
keeping
remarked
flurry
who
had
been
looking
on
silently
with
as
i
had
noticed
a
still
and
amused
eye
the
rim
of
that
small
keg
there
looks
as
if
it
had
been
shifted
lately
the
sergeant
looked
hard
at
flurry
he
knew
as
well
as
most
people
that
a
hint
from
knox
was
usually
worth
taking
he
turned
to
murray
will
i
open
it
sir
oh
open
it
if
knox
wishes
said
murray
who
was
not
famous
for
appreciating
other
people
suggestions
the
keg
was
opened
funny
butter
said
flurry
the
sergeant
said
nothing
the
keg
was
full
of
black
another
was
opened
and
another
all
with
the
same
result
damnation
said
murray
suddenly
losing
his
temper
what
the
use
of
going
on
with
those
try
one
of
the
rum
casks
a
few
moments
passed
in
total
silence
while
a
tap
and
a
spigot
were
sent
for
and
applied
to
the
barrel
the
sergeant
drew
off
a
mugful
and
put
his
nose
to
it
with
the
deliberation
of
a
connoisseur
water
sir
he
pronounced
dirty
water
with
a
small
indication
of
sperrits
a
junior
constable
tittered
explosively
met
the
light
blue
glare
of
murray
eye
and
withered
away
perhaps
it
holy
water
said
i
with
a
wavering
voice
murray
glance
pinned
me
like
an
assegai
and
i
also
faded
into
the
background
well
said
flurry
in
dulcet
tones
if
you
want
to
know
where
the
stuff
is
that
was
in
those
barrels
i
can
tell
you
for
i
was
told
it
myself
ago
it
gone
to
cork
with
the
bishop
by
special
train
canty
was
undoubtedly
a
man
of
resource
canty
had
mistakenly
credited
me
with
an
intelligence
equal
to
her
own
and
on
receiving
from
slipper
a
highly
coloured
account
of
how
audibly
canty
had
slept
off
his
potations
had
regarded
the
secret
of
holy
island
as
having
been
given
away
that
night
and
the
two
succeeding
ones
were
spent
in
the
transfer
of
the
rum
to
bottles
and
the
bottles
and
the
butter
to
fish
boxes
these
were
by
means
of
a
slight
lubrication
of
the
railway
underlings
loaded
into
a
truck
as
fresh
fish
urgent
and
attached
to
the
bishop
funeral
train
while
the
police
decoyed
far
from
the
scene
of
action
were
breaking
their
backs
over
barrels
of

you

the
pub
that
canty
brother
has
in
cork

i
do

going
to
buy
some
rum
there
next
week
cheap
i
shall
proceed
against

murray
with
fateful
calm
you
wo
proceed
far
said
flurry
you
not
get
as
much
evidence
out
of
the
whole
country
as
hang
a
cat
who
was
your
informant
demanded
murray
flurry
laughed
well
by
the
time
the
train
was
in
cork
yourself
and
the
major
were
the
only
two
men
in
the
town
that
were
talking
about
it
ix
the
policy
of
the
closed
door
the
disasters
and
humiliations
that
befell
me
at
drumcurran
fair
may
yet
be
remembered
they
certainly
have
not
been
forgotten
in
the
regions
about
skebawn
where
the
tale
of
how
bernard
shute
and
i
stole

has
passed
into
history
the
of
the
mountain
hare
bought
by
shute
with
such
enthusiasm
was
restored
to
that
position
between
the
shafts
of

well
fitted
to
grace

his
other

spent
the
two
months
following
on
the

in
favouring
a
leg
with
a
strained
sinew

in
receiving
visits
from

summed
her
up

another

philippa
made
her
début
with
hounds
at
an
uneventful
morning
cubbing
with
no
particular
result
except
that
philippa
returned
home
so
stiff
that
she
had
to
go
to
bed
for
a
day
and
arose

determined
than
ever
to

out
for

for

day
the
weather
was
grey
and
quiet
and
full
of
all
the
moist
sweetness
of
an
irish
autumn
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
rain
during
the
past
month
it
had
turned
the
bracken
to
a
purple
brown
and
had
filled
the
hollows
with
shining
splashes
of
water
the
dead
leaves
were
slippery
under
foot
and
the
branches
above
were
thinly
decked
with
yellow
where
the
pallid
survivors
of
summer
still
clung
to
their
posts
as
philippa

i
sedately
approached

hurriedly
as

to
exhibit
silently
the
corner
of
a
clean
i
have
seen
her
cry
when
a
police
constable
won
a
bicycle
race
in
skebawn
she
has
wept
at
hearing
sir
valentine
knox
health
drunk
with
musical
honours
at
a
tenants
dinner
it
is
an
amiable
custom
but
as
she
herself
admits
it
is
unbecoming
an
imposing
throng
in
point
of
numbers
was
gathered
at
the
the
riders
being
almost
swamped
in
the
crowd
of
traps
outside
cars
bicyclists
and
people
on
foot
the
field
was
an
eminently
representative
one
the
clan
knox
was
as
usual
there
in
force
its
more
aristocratic
members
dingily
respectable
in
black
coats
and
tall
hats
that
went
impartially
to
weddings
funerals
and
hunts
and
like
a
horse
that
is
past
mark
of
mouth
were
no
longer
to
be
identified
with
any
special
epoch
there
was
a
humbler
squireen
element
in
tweeds
and
and
a
good
muster
of
farmers
men
of
the
spare
west
of
ireland
type
on
horses
that
ranged
from
the
cart
mare
clipped
trace
high
to
shaggy
and
leggy
none
of
them
hunters
but
all
of
them
able
to
hunt
philippa
and
i
worked
our
way
to
the
heart
of
things
where
was
flurry
seated
on
his
brown
mare
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
somewhat
moody
silence
as
we
exchanged
greetings
i
was
aware
that
his
eye
was
resting
with
extreme
disfavour
upon
two
approaching
figures
i
put
up
my
and
perceived
that
one
of
them
was
miss
sally
knox
on
a
tall
grey
horse
the
other
was
bernard
shute
in
all
the
flawless
beauty
of
his
first
pink
coat
mounted
on
stockbroker
a
bay
recently
purchased
from
hickey
during
the
languors
of
a
damp
autumn
the
neighbourhood
had
been
much
nourished
and
sustained
by
the
privilege
of
observing
and
diagnosing
the
progress
of
shute
flirtation
with
miss
sally
knox
what
made
it
all
the
more
enjoyable
for
the
or
most
of
them
was
that
although
bernard
courtship
was
of
the
nature
of
a
proclamation
from
the
housetops
miss
knox
attitude
left
everything
to
the
imagination
to
flurry
knox
the
romantic
but
despicable
position
of
slighted
rival
was
comfortably
allotted
his
sole
sympathisers
were
philippa
and
old
knox
of
aussolas
but
no
one
knew
if
he
needed
sympathisers
flurry
was
a
man
of
mystery
shute
and
miss
knox
approached
us
rapidly
the
latter
mount
pulling
hard
flurry
i
said
is
that
grey
the
horse
shute
bought
from
you
last
july
at
the
fair
flurry
did
not
answer
me
his
face
was
as
black
as
thunder
he
turned
his
horse
round
cursing
two
country
boys
who
got
in
his
way
with
low
and
concentrated
venom
and
began
to
move
forward
followed
by
the
hounds
if
his
wish
was
to
avoid
speaking
to
miss
sally
it
was
not
to
be
gratified
flurry
she
began
sitting
close
down
to
ramping
jog
as
she
rode
up
beside
her
cousin
what
a
hurry
you
in
we
passed
no
end
of
people
on
the
road
who
wo
be
here
for
another
ten
minutes
no
more
will
i
was
knox
cryptic
reply
as
he
spurred
the
brown
mare
into
a
trot
moonlighter
made
a
vigorous
but
frustrated
effort
to
buck
and
indemnified
himself
by
a
successful
kick
at
a
hound
bother
you
flurry
ca
you
walk
for
a
minute
exclaimed
miss
sally
who
looked
about
as
large
in
relation
to
her
horse
as
the
conventional
tomtit
on
a
round
of
beef
you
might
have
more
sense
than
to
crack
your
whip
under
this
horse
nose
i
do
believe
you
know
what
horse
it
is
even
i
was
not
near
enough
to
catch
flurry
reply
well
if
you
did
want
him
to
be
lent
to
me
you
should
have
sold
him
to
mr
shute
retorted
miss
knox
in
her
clear
provoking
little
voice
i
suppose
he
afraid
to
ride
him
himself
said
flurry
turning
his
horse
in
at
a
gate
get
ahead
there
jerome
ca
you
it
better
to
put
them
in
at
this
end
than
to
have
every
one
riding
on
top
of
them
miss
sally
cheeks
were
still
very
pink
when
i
came
up
and
began
to
talk
to
her
and
her
eyes
had
a
look
in
them
like
those
of
an
angry
kitten
the
riders
moved
slowly
down
a
rough
and
took
up
their
position
along
the
brow
of
ardmeen
covert
into
which
the
hounds
had
already
hurled
themselves
with
their
customary
contempt
for
the
convenances
flurry
hounds
true
to
their
nationality
were
in
the
habit
of
doing
the
right
thing
in
the
wrong
way
untouched
by
autumn
the
furze
bushes
of
ardmeen
covert
were
darkly
green
save
for
a
golden
fleck
of
blossom
here
and
there
and
the
glistening
grey
cobwebs
that
stretched
from
spike
to
spike
the
look
of
the
ordinary
gorse
covert
is
familiar
to
most
people
as
a
tidy
enclosure
of
an
acre
or
so
filled
with
low
plants
of
gorse
not
so
many
will
be
found
who
have
experience
of
it
as
a
rocky
sedgy
wilderness
half
a
mile
square
garrisoned
with
brigades
of
furze
bushes
some
of
them
higher
than
a
horse
head
lean
strong
and
cunning
like
the
foxes
that
breed
in
them
impenetrable
with
their
bristling
spikes
as
a
hedge
of
bayonets
by
dint
of
infinite
leisure
and
obstinate
greed
the
cattle
had
made
paths
for
themselves
through
the
bushes
to
the
patches
of
grass
that
they
hemmed
in
their
hoofprints
were
guides
to
the
explorer
down
muddy
staircases
of
rock
and
across
black
intervals
of
unplumbed
bog
the
whole
covert
slanted
gradually
down
to
a
small
river
that
raced
round
three
sides
of
it
and
beyond
the
stream
in
agreeable
contrast
lay
a
clean
and
wholesome
country
of
grass
fields
and
banks
the
hounds
drew
slowly
along
and
down
the
hill
towards
the
river
and
the
riders
hung
about
outside
the
covert
and
tried
i
can
answer
for
at
least
one
of
them
to
decide
which
was
the
least
odious
of
the
ways
through
it
in
the
event
of
the
fox
breaking
at
the
far
side
miss
sally
took
up
a
position
not
very
far
from
me
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
had
her
hands
full
with
her
borrowed
mount
on
whose
temper
the
delay
and
suspense
were
visibly
telling
his
neck
was
white
from
the
chafing
of
the
reins
had
the
ground
under
his
feet
been
he
could
hardly
have
sidled
and
hopped
more
uncontrollably
nothing
but
the
most
impassioned
conjugation
of
the
verb
to
condemn
could
have
supplied
any
human
equivalent
for
the
manner
in
which
he
tore
holes
in
the
sedgy
grass
with
a
furious
forefoot
those
who
were
even
superficial
judges
of
character
gave
his
heels
a
liberal
allowance
of
and
shute
who
could
not
be
numbered
among
such
and
had
as
usual
taken
up
a
position
as
near
miss
sally
as
possible
was
rewarded
by
a
double
knock
on
his
horse
ribs
that
was
a
cause
of
heartless
mirth
to
the
lady
of
his
affections
not
a
hound
had
as
yet
spoken
but
they
were
forcing
their
way
through
the
gorse
forest
and
shoving
each
other
jealously
aside
with
growing
excitement
and
flurry
could
be
seen
at
intervals
moving
forward
in
the
direction
they
were
indicating
it
was
at
this
juncture
that
the
ubiquitous
slipper
presented
himself
at
my
horse
shoulder
is
for
the
river
he
making
major
he
said
with
an
upward
roll
of
his
squinting
eyes
that
nearly
made
me
he
a
castle
knox
fox
that
came
in
this
morning
and
ye
should
get
ahead
down
to
the
ford
a
tip
from
slipper
was
not
to
be
neglected
and
philippa
and
i
began
a
cautious
progress
through
the
gorse
followed
by
miss
knox
as
quietly
as
moonlighter
nerves
would
permit
wishful
has
it
she
exclaimed
as
a
hound
came
out
into
view
uttered
a
sharp
yelp
and
drove
forward
hark
hark
roared
flurry
with
at
least
three
r
reverberating
in
each
hark
at
the
same
instant
came
a
holloa
from
the
farther
side
of
the
river
and
hickey
renowned
and
screech
was
uplifted
at
the
bottom
of
the
covert
then
babel
broke
forth
as
the
hounds
converging
from
every
quarter
flung
themselves
shrieking
on
the
line
moonlighter
went
straight
up
on
his
and
dropped
again
with
a
bound
that
sent
him
crushing
past
philippa
and
cruiskeen
he
did
it
a
second
time
and
was
almost
on
to
the
tail
of
the
quaker
whose
bulky
person
was
not
to
be
hurried
in
any
emergency
get
on
if
you
can
major
yeates
called
out
sally
steadying
the
grey
as
well
as
she
could
in
the
narrow
pathway
between
the
great
gorse
bushes
other
horses
were
thundering
behind
us
men
were
shouting
to
each
other
in
similar
passages
right
and
left
of
us
the
cry
of
the
hounds
filled
the
air
with
a
kind
of
delirium
a
low
wall
with
a
stick
laid
along
it
barred
the
passage
in
front
of
me
and
the
quaker
firmly
and
immediately
decided
not
to
have
it
until
some
one
else
had
dislodged
the
pole
go
ahead
i
shouted
squeezing
to
one
side
with
heroic
disregard
of
the
furze
bushes
and
my
new
tops
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
my
mouth
when
moonlighter
mad
with
thwarted
excitement
shot
by
me
hurtled
over
the
obstacle
with
extravagant
fury
landed
twelve
feet
beyond
it
on
clattering
slippery
rock
saved
himself
from
falling
with
an
forward
buck
on
to
sedgy
ground
and
bolted
at
full
speed
down
the
muddy
cattle
track
there
are
corners
rocky
most
of
them
in
that
cattle
track
that
sally
has
told
me
she
will
remember
to
her
dying
day
boggy
holes
of
any
depth
ranging
between
two
feet
and
to
australia
that
she
says
she
does
not
fail
to
mention
in
the
general
thanksgiving
but
at
the
time
they
occupied
mere
fractions
of
the
strenuous
seconds
in
which
it
was
hopeless
for
her
to
do
anything
but
try
to
steer
trust
to
luck
sit
hard
down
into
the
saddle
and
try
to
stay
there
for
my
part
i
would
as
soon
try
to
adhere
to
the
horns
of
a
charging
bull
as
to
the
crutches
of
a
but
happily
the
necessity
is
not
likely
to
arise
i
saw
flurry
knox
a
little
ahead
of
her
on
the
same
track
jamming
his
mare
into
the
furze
bushes
to
get
out
of
her
way
he
shouted
something
after
her
about
the
ford
and
started
to
gallop
for
it
himself
by
a
breakneck
short
cut
the
hounds
were
already
across
the
river
and
it
was
obvious
that
ford
or
no
ford
moonlighter
intentions
might
be
simply
expressed
in
the
formula
be
with
them
i
will
it
was
all
to
the
river
and
among
the
furze
bushes
and
rocks
there
was
neither
time
nor
place
to
turn
him
he
rushed
at
it
with
a
shattering
slip
upon
a
streak
of
rock
with
a
heavy
plunge
in
the
deep
ground
by
the
brink
it
was
as
bad
a
for
twenty
feet
of
water
as
could
well
be
found
the
grey
horse
rose
out
of
the
boggy
stuff
with
all
the
impetus
that
pace
and
temper
could
give
but
it
was
not
enough
for
one
instant
the
twisting
sliding
current
was
under
sally
the
next
a
veil
of
water
sprang
up
all
round
her
and
moonlighter
was
rolling
and
lurching
in
the
desperate
effort
to
find
foothold
in
the
rocky
bed
of
the
stream
i
was
following
at
the
best
pace
i
could
kick
out
of
the
quaker
and
saw
the
water
swirl
into
her
lap
as
her
horse
rolled
to
the
she
caught
the
mane
to
save
herself
but
he
struggled
on
to
his
legs
again
and
came
floundering
broadside
on
to
the
farther
bank
in
three
seconds
she
had
got
out
of
the
saddle
and
flung
herself
at
the
bank
grasping
the
rushes
and
trying
in
spite
of
the
sodden
weight
of
her
habit
to
drag
herself
out
of
the
water
at
the
same
instant
i
saw
flurry
and
the
brown
mare
dashing
through
the
ford
twenty
yards
higher
up
he
was
off
his
horse
and
beside
her
with
that
uncanny
quickness
that
flurry
reserved
for
moments
of
emergency
and
catching
her
by
the
arms
swung
her
on
to
the
bank
as
easily
as
if
she
had
been
the
kennel
terrier
catch
the
horse
she
called
out
scrambling
to
her
feet
damn
the
horse
returned
flurry
in
the
rage
that
is
so
often
the
reaction
from
a
bad
scare
i
turned
along
the
bank
and
made
for
the
ford
by
this
time
it
was
full
of
hustling
splashing
riders
through
whom
bernard
shute
furiously
picking
up
a
bad
start
drove
a
devastating
way
he
tried
to
turn
his
horse
down
the
bank
towards
miss
knox
but
the
hounds
were
running
hard
and
to
my
intense
amusement
stockbroker
refused
to
abandon
the
chase
and
swept
his
rider
away
in
the
wake
of
his
stable
companion
hickey
young
chestnut
by
this
time
two
country
boys
had
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
risen
from
the
earth
and
fished
moonlighter
out
of
the
stream
miss
sally
wound
up
an
acrimonious
argument
with
her
cousin
by
observing
that
she
did
care
what
he
said
and
placing
her
boot
in
his
obviously
unwilling
hand
in
a
second
was
again
in
the
saddle
gathering
up
the
wet
reins
with
the
trembling
clumsy
fingers
of
a
person
who
is
thoroughly
chilled
and
in
a
violent
hurry
she
set
moonlighter
going
and
was
away
in
a
moment
galloping
him
at
the
first
fence
at
a
pace
that
suited
his
ideas
mr
knox
panted
philippa
who
had
by
this
time
joined
us
make
her
go
home
she
can
go
where
she
likes
as
far
as
i
concerned
responded
knox
pitching
himself
on
his
mare
back
and
digging
in
the
spurs
moonlighter
had
already
glided
over
the
bank
in
front
of
us
with
a
perfunctory
flick
at
it
with
his
heels
flurry
mare
and
cruiskeen
jumped
it
side
by
side
with
equal
precision
it
was
a
bank
of
some
five
feet
high
the
quaker
charged
it
enthusiastically
refused
it
abruptly
and
according
to
his
infuriating
custom
at
such
moments
proceeded
to
tear
hurried
mouthfuls
of
grass
will
i
give
him
a
couple
o
belts
your
honour
shouted
one
of
the
running
accompaniment
of
country
boys
you
will
said
i
with
some
further
remarks
to
the
quaker
that
i
need
not
commit
to
paper
swish
whack
the
sound
was
music
in
my
ears
as
the
good
remorseless
ash
sapling
bent
round
the
quaker
dappled
at
the
third
stripe
he
launched
both
his
heels
in
the
operator
face
at
the
fourth
he
reared
undecidedly
at
the
fifth
he
bundled
over
the
bank
in
a
manner
purged
of
hesitation
ha
yelled
my
assistants
that
put
the
fear
o
god
in
him
as
the
quaker
fled
headlong
after
the
hunt
he
be
the
betther
o
that
while
he
lives
without
going
quite
as
far
as
this
i
must
admit
that
for
the
next
he
was
astonishingly
the
better
of
it
the
castle
knox
fox
was
making
a
very
pretty
line
of
it
over
the
seven
miles
that
separated
him
from
his
home
he
headed
through
a
grassy
country
of
ireland
mild
and
brilliant
green
fenced
with
sound
and
buxom
banks
enlivened
by
stone
walls
uncompromised
by
the
presence
of
gates
and
yet
comfortably
laced
with
lanes
for
the
furtherance
of
those
who
had
laid
to
heart
wolsey
valuable
advice
fling
away
ambition
by
that
sin
fell
the
angels
the
flotsam
and
jetsam
of
the
hunt
pervaded
the
landscape
standing
on
one
long
bank
three
dismounted
farmers
flogged
away
at
the
refusing
steeds
below
them
like
anglers
trying
to
rise
a
sulky
fish
hats
bobbing
in
a
string
showed
where
the
road
riders
followed
the
delusive
windings
of
a
bohereen
it
was
obvious
that
in
the
matter
of
ambition
they
would
not
have
caused
cardinal
wolsey
a
moment
uneasiness
whether
angels
or
otherwise
they
were
not
going
to
run
any
risk
of
falling
flurry
red
coat
was
like
a
beacon
two
fields
ahead
of
me
with
philippa
following
in
his
tracks
it
was
the
first
run
worthy
of
the
name
that
philippa
had
ridden
and
i
blessed
miss
bobby
bennett
as
i
saw
cruiskeen
undefeated
fencing
an
encouraging
twang
of
the
doctor
horn
notified
that
the
hounds
were
giving
us
a
chance
even
the
quaker
pricked
his
blunt
ears
and
swerved
in
his
stride
to
the
sound
a
stone
wall
a
rough
patch
of
heather
a
boggy
field
dinted
deep
and
black
with
hoof
marks
and
the
stern
chase
was
at
an
end
the
hounds
had
checked
on
the
outskirts
of
a
small
wood
and
the
field
thinned
down
to
a
panting
dozen
or
so
viewed
us
with
the
disfavour
shown
by
the
first
flight
towards
those
who
unexpectedly
add
to
their
select
number
in
the
depths
of
the
wood
hickey
might
be
heard
uttering
those
singular
little
yelps
of
encouragement
that
to
the
irreverent
suggest
a
milkman
in
his
dotage
bernard
shute
who
neither
knew
nor
cared
what
the
hounds
were
doing
was
expatiating
at
great
length
to
an
uninterested
squireen
upon
the
virtues
and
perfections
of
his
new
mount
i
did
all
i
knew
to
come
and
help
you
at
the
river
he
said
riding
up
to
the
splashed
and
still
dripping
sally
but
stockbroker
hear
of
it
i
pulled
his
ugly
head
round
till
his
nose
was
on
my
boot
but
he
galloped
away
just
the
same
he
was
quite
right
said
miss
sally
i
did
want
you
in
the
least
as
miss
sally
red
gold
coil
of
hair
was
turned
towards
me
during
this
speech
i
could
only
infer
the
glance
with
which
it
was
delivered
from
the
fact
that
shute
responded
to
it
with
one
of
those
firm
gazes
of
adoration
in
which
the
neighbourhood
took
such
an
interest
and
crumbled
away
into
incoherency
a
shout
from
the
top
of
a
hill
interrupted
the
amenities
of
the
check
flurry
was
out
of
the
wood
in
seconds
blowing
shattering
blasts
upon
his
horn
and
the
hounds
rushed
to
him
knowing
the
gone
away
note
that
was
never
blown
in
vain
the
brown
mare
came
out
through
the
trees
and
the
undergrowth
like
a
woodcock
down
the
wind
and
jumped
across
a
stream
on
to
a
more
than
questionable
bank
the
hounds
splashed
and
struggled
after
him
and
as
they
landed
the
first
ecstatic
whimpers
broke
forth
in
a
moment
it
was
full
cry
discordant
beautiful
and
as
the
pack
spread
and
sped
and
settled
to
the
line
i
saw
the
absurd
dazzle
of
tears
in
philippa
eyes
and
found
time
for
the
insulting
proffer
of
the
clean
as
we
all
galloped
hard
to
get
away
on
good
terms
with
the
hounds
it
was
one
of
those
elect
moments
in
when
the
fittest
alone
have
survived
even
the
quaker
sluggish
blood
was
stirred
by
good
company
and
possibly
by
the
remembrance
of
the
singing
and
he
lumbered
up
tall
banks
and
down
heavy
drops
and
across
wide
ditches
in
astounding
adherence
to
the
line
cut
out
by
flurry
cruiskeen
went
like
a
book
a
story
for
girls
very
pleasant
and
safe
but
rather
slow
moonlighter
was
pulling
miss
sally
on
to
the
sterns
of
the
hounds
flying
his
banks
rocketing
like
a
pheasant
over
walls
committing
in
fact
all
the
crimes
induced
by
youth
and
he
would
have
done
very
comfortably
with
another
six
or
seven
stone
on
his
back
why
bernard
shute
did
not
come
off
at
every
fence
and
generally
die
a
thousand
deaths
i
can
not
explain
occasionally
i
rather
wished
he
would
as
from
my
secure
position
in
the
rear
i
saw
him
charging
his
fences
at
whatever
pace
and
place
seemed
good
to
the
thoroughly
demoralised
stockbroker
and
in
so
doing
cannon
heavily
against
hickey
on
landing
over
a
rotten
ditch
jump
a
wall
with
his
spur
rowelling
charlie
knox
boot
and
cut
in
at
top
speed
in
front
of
flurry
who
was
scientifically
cramming
his
mare
up
a
very
awkward
scramble
in
so
far
as
i
could
think
of
anything
beyond
philippa
and
myself
and
the
next
fence
i
thought
there
would
be
trouble
for
shute
in
consequence
of
this
last
feat
it
was
a
long
to
be
remembered
in
spite
of
the
quaker
ponderous
and
unalterable
gallop
in
spite
of
the
thump
with
which
he
came
down
off
his
banks
in
spite
of
the
confiding
manner
in
which
he
hung
upon
my
hand
we
were
nearing
castle
knox
and
the
riders
began
to
edge
away
from
the
hounds
towards
a
gate
that
broke
the
long
barrier
of
the
demesne
wall
steaming
horses
and
riders
clattered
and
crushed
in
at
the
gate
there
was
a
moment
of
pulling
up
and
listening
in
which
quivering
tails
and
pumping
sides
told
their
own
story
breathing
suggested
a
cross
between
a
grampus
and
a
gramophone
philippa
hair
had
come
down
and
she
had
a
stitch
in
her
side
moonlighter
fresher
than
ever
stamped
and
dragged
at
his
bit
i
thought
little
miss
sally
looked
very
white
the
bewildering
clamour
of
the
hounds
was
all
through
the
wide
laurel
plantations
at
a
word
from
flurry
hickey
shoved
his
horse
ahead
and
turned
down
a
ride
followed
by
most
of
the
field
philippa
i
said
severely
you
had
enough
and
you
know
it
do
go
up
to
the
house
and
make
them
give
you
something
to
eat
struck
in
miss
sally
twisting
moonlighter
round
to
keep
his
mind
occupied
and
as
for
you
miss
sally
i
went
on
in
the
manner
of
fairchild
the
sooner
you
get
off
that
horse
and
out
of
those
wet
things
the
better
flurry
who
was
just
in
front
of
us
said
nothing
but
gave
a
short
and
most
disagreeable
laugh
philippa
accepted
my
suggestion
with
the
meekness
of
exhaustion
but
under
the
circumstances
it
did
not
surprise
me
that
miss
sally
did
not
follow
her
example
then
ensued
an
hour
of
woodland
hunting
at
its
worst
and
most
bewildering
i
galloped
after
flurry
and
miss
sally
up
and
down
long
glittering
lanes
of
laurel
at
every
other
moment
burying
my
face
in
the
quaker
coarse
white
mane
to
avoid
the
slash
of
the
branches
and
receiving
down
the
back
of
my
neck
showers
of
drops
stored
up
from
the
rain
of
the
day
before
playing
an
endless
game
of
with
the
hounds
and
never
getting
any
nearer
to
them
as
they
turned
and
doubled
through
the
thickets
of
evergreens
even
to
my
limited
understanding
of
the
situation
it
became
clear
at
length
that
two
foxes
were
on
foot
most
of
the
hounds
were
hard
at
work
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
but
flurry
with
a
grim
face
and
a
faithful
three
couple
stuck
to
the
failing
line
of
the
hunted
fox
there
came
a
moment
when
miss
sally
and
i
who
through
many
vicissitudes
had
clung
to
each
other
found
ourselves
at
a
spot
where
two
rides
crossed
flurry
was
waiting
there
and
a
little
way
up
one
of
the
rides
a
couple
of
hounds
were
hustling
to
and
fro
with
the
thwarted
whimpers
half
breaking
from
them
he
held
up
his
hand
to
stop
us
and
at
that
identical
moment
bernard
shute
like
a
bolt
from
the
blue
burst
upon
our
vision
it
need
scarcely
be
mentioned
that
he
was
going
at
full
gallop
i
have
rarely
seen
him
ride
at
any
other
pace
and
as
he
bore
down
upon
flurry
and
the
hounds
ducking
and
dodging
to
avoid
the
branches
he
shouted
something
about
a
fox
having
gone
away
at
the
other
side
of
the
covert
hold
hard
roared
flurry
do
you
see
the
hounds
you
fool
shute
to
do
him
justice
held
hard
with
all
the
strength
of
his
body
but
it
was
of
no
avail
the
bay
horse
had
got
his
head
down
and
his
tail
up
there
was
a
piercing
yell
from
a
hound
as
it
was
ridden
over
and
flurry
brown
mare
will
not
soon
forget
the
moment
when
stockbroker
shoulder
took
her
on
the
point
of
the
hip
and
sent
her
staggering
into
the
laurel
branches
as
she
swung
round
flurry
whip
went
up
and
with
a
swift
backhander
the
cane
and
the
looped
thong
caught
bernard
across
his
broad
shoulders
o
mr
shute
shrieked
miss
sally
as
i
stared
dumfoundered
did
that
branch
hurt
you
all
right
nothing
to
signify
he
called
out
as
he
bucketed
past
tugging
at
his
horse
head
thought
some
one
had
hit
me
at
first
come
on
we
catch
up
this
way
he
swung
perilously
into
the
main
ride
and
was
gone
totally
unaware
of
the
position
that
miss
sally
quickness
had
saved
flurry
rode
straight
up
to
his
cousin
with
a
pale
dangerous
face
i
suppose
you
think
i
to
stand
being
ridden
over
and
having
my
hounds
killed
to
please
you
he
said
but
you
mistaken
you
were
very
smart
and
you
may
think
you
saved
him
his
licking
but
you
need
think
he
wo
get
it
he
have
it
in
spite
of
you
before
he
goes
to
his
bed
this
night
a
man
who
loses
his
temper
badly
because
he
is
badly
in
love
is
inevitably
ridiculous
far
though
he
may
be
from
thinking
himself
so
he
is
also
a
highly
unpleasant
person
to
argue
with
and
miss
sally
and
i
held
our
peace
respectfully
he
turned
his
horse
and
rode
away
almost
instantly
the
three
couple
of
hounds
opened
in
the
underwood
near
us
with
a
deafening
crash
and
not
twenty
yards
ahead
the
hunted
fox
dark
with
wet
and
mud
slunk
across
the
ride
the
hounds
were
almost
on
his
brush
moonlighter
reared
and
chafed
the
din
was
redoubled
passed
away
to
a
little
distance
and
suddenly
seemed
stationary
in
the
middle
of
the
laurels
could
he
have
got
into
the
old
exclaimed
miss
sally
with
reviving
excitement
she
pushed
ahead
and
turned
down
the
narrowest
of
all
the
rides
that
had
that
day
been
my
portion
at
the
end
of
the
green
tunnel
there
was
a
comparatively
open
space
flurry
mare
was
standing
in
it
riderless
and
flurry
himself
was
hammering
with
a
stone
at
the
padlock
of
a
door
that
seemed
to
lead
into
the
heart
of
a
laurel
clump
the
hounds
were
baying
furiously
somewhere
back
of
the
entrance
among
the
laurel
stems
he
got
in
by
the
old
ice
drain
said
flurry
addressing
himself
sulkily
to
me
and
ignoring
miss
sally
he
had
not
the
least
idea
of
how
absurd
was
his
scowling
face
draped
by
the
luxuriant
that
overhung
the
doorway
the
padlock
yielded
and
the
opening
door
revealed
a
low
dark
passage
into
which
flurry
disappeared
lugging
a
couple
of
hounds
with
him
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
the
remaining
two
couple
bayed
implacably
at
the
mouth
of
the
drain
the
croak
of
a
rusty
bolt
told
of
a
second
door
at
the
inner
end
of
the
passage
look
out
for
the
steps
flurry
they
all
broken
called
out
miss
sally
in
tones
of
honey
there
was
no
answer
miss
sally
looked
at
me
her
face
was
serious
but
her
mischievous
eyes
made
a
confederate
of
me
he
in
an
rage
she
said
i
afraid
there
will
certainly
be
a
row
a
row
there
certainly
was
but
it
was
in
the
cavern
of
the
where
the
fox
had
evidently
been
discovered
miss
sally
suddenly
flung
moonlighter
reins
to
me
and
slipped
off
his
back
hold
him
she
said
and
dived
into
the
doorway
under
the
overhanging
branches
things
happened
after
that
with
astonishing
simultaneousness
there
was
a
shrill
exclamation
from
miss
sally
the
inner
door
was
slammed
and
bolted
and
at
one
and
the
same
moment
the
fox
darted
from
the
entry
and
was
away
into
the
wood
before
one
could
wink
what
happened
i
called
out
playing
the
refractory
moonlighter
like
a
salmon
miss
sally
appeared
at
the
doorway
looking
half
scared
and
half
delighted
i
bolted
him
in
and
i
wo
let
him
out
till
he
promises
to
be
good
i
was
only
just
in
time
to
slam
the
door
after
the
fox
bolted
out
great
scott
i
said
helplessly
miss
sally
vanished
again
into
the
passage
and
the
imprisoned
hounds
continued
to
express
their
emotions
in
the
echoing
vault
of
the
their
master
remained
mute
as
the
dead
and
i
trembled
flurry
i
heard
miss
sally
say
flurry
i
i
locked
you
in
this
piece
of
information
met
with
no
response
shall
i
tell
you
why
a
keener
note
seemed
to
indicate
that
a
hound
had
been
kicked
i
do
care
whether
you
answer
me
or
not
i
going
to
tell
you
there
was
a
pause
apparently
telling
him
was
not
as
simple
as
had
been
expected
i
wo
let
you
out
till
you
promise
me
something
ah
flurry
be
so
cross
what
do
you
say
oh
that
a
ridiculous
thing
to
say
you
know
quite
well
it
not
on
his
account
there
was
another
considerable
pause
flurry
said
miss
sally
again
in
tones
that
would
have
wiled
a
badger
from
his
earth
dear
flurry
at
this
point
i
hurriedly
flung
moonlighter
bridle
over
a
branch
and
withdrew
my
own
subsequent
adventures
are
quite
immaterial
until
the
moment
when
i
encountered
miss
sally
on
the
steps
of
the
hall
door
at
castle
knox
i
just
going
in
to
take
off
these
wet
things
she
said
airily
this
was
no
way
to
treat
a
confederate
well
i
said
barring
her
progress
oh
he
he
promised
it
all
right
she
replied
rather
breathlessly
there
was
no
one
about
i
waited
resolutely
for
further
information
it
did
not
come
did
he
try
to
make
his
own
terms
said
i
looking
hard
at
her
yes
he
did
she
tried
to
pass
me
and
what
did
you
do
i
refused
them
she
said
with
the
sudden
stagger
of
a
sob
in
her
voice
as
she
escaped
into
the
house
now
what
on
earth
was
sally
knox
crying
about
x
the
house
of
fahy
nothing
could
shake
the
conviction
of
maria
that
she
was
by
nature
and
by
practice
a
house
dog
every
one
of
shreelane
many
doors
had
at
one
time
or
another
slammed
upon
her
expulsion
and
each
one
of
them
had
seen
her
stealthy
irrepressible
return
to
the
sphere
that
she
felt
herself
so
eminently
qualified
to
grace
for
her
the
bone
thriftily
interred
by
tim
connor
terrier
was
a
mere
diversion
even
the
fruitage
of
the
ashpit
had
little
charm
for
an
accomplished
of
the
kitchen
she
knew
to
a
nicety
which
of
the
doors
could
be
burst
open
by
assault
at
which
it
was
necessary
to
whine
sycophantically
and
the
clinical
thermometer
alone
could
furnish
a
parallel
for
her
perception
of
mood
in
those
in
authority
in
the
case
of
cadogan
she
knew
that
there
were
seasons
when
instant
and
complete
was
the
only
course
to
pursue
therefore
when
on
a
certain
morning
in
july
on
my
way
through
the
downstairs
regions
to
my
office
i
saw
her
approach
the
kitchen
door
with
her
usual
circumspection
and
on
hearing
her
name
enunciated
indignantly
by
my
cook
withdraw
swiftly
to
a
city
of
refuge
at
the
back
of
the
hayrick
i
drew
my
own
conclusions
had
she
remained
as
i
did
she
would
have
heard
the
disclosure
of
a
crime
that
lay
more
heavily
on
her
digestion
than
her
conscience
i
ca
put
a
thing
out
o
me
hand
but
he
watching
me
to
whip
it
away
declaimed
cadogan
with
all
the
disregard
of
her
kind
for
the
accident
of
sex
in
the
brute
creation
was
only
last
night
i
was
back
in
the
scullery
when
i
heard
bridget
let
a
screech
and
there
was
me
brave
dog
up
on
the
table
eating
the
roast
beef
that
was
after
coming
out
from
the
dinner
brute
interjected
philippa
with
what
i
well
knew
to
be
a
simulated
wrath
and
i
had
planned
that
bit
of
beef
for
the
luncheon
continued
cadogan
in
impassioned
lamentation
the
way
we
would
have
to
inthrude
on
the
cold
turkey
sure
he
has
it
that
dhragged
that
all
we
can
do
with
it
now
is
run
it
through
the
mincing
machine
for
the
major
sandwiches
at
this
appetising
suggestion
i
thought
fit
to
intervene
in
the
deliberations
one
thing
i
said
to
philippa
afterwards
as
i
wrapped
up
a
bottle
of
yanatas
in
a
cardigan
jacket
and
rammed
it
into
an
already
apoplectic
gladstone
bag
that
i
do
draw
the
line
at
is
taking
that
dog
with
us
the
whole
business
is
black
enough
as
it
is
dear
said
my
wife
looking
at
me
with
almost
clairvoyant
abstraction
i
could
manage
a
second
evening
dress
if
you
did
mind
putting
my
in
your
portmanteau
little
thank
heaven
as
i
know
about
yachting
i
knew
enough
to
make
pertinent
remarks
on
the
incongruity
of
an
ancient
hireling
and
a
fleet
of
smart
evening
dresses
but
none
the
less
i
left
a
pair
of
indispensable
boots
behind
and
the
went
into
my
portmanteau
it
is
doing
no
more
than
the
barest
justice
to
the
officers
of
the
royal
navy
to
say
that
so
far
as
i
know
them
they
cherish
no
mistaken
enthusiasm
for
a
home
on
the
rolling
deep
when
a
home
anywhere
else
presents
itself
bernard
shute
had
unfortunately
proved
an
exception
to
this
rule
during
the
winter
the
invitation
to
go
for
a
cruise
in
the
yacht
that
was
in
process
of
building
for
him
hung
over
me
like
a
cloud
a
timely
strike
in
the
builder
yard
brought
a
respite
and
in
fact
placed
the
completion
of
the
yacht
at
so
safe
a
distance
that
i
was
betrayed
into
specious
regrets
echoed
with
an
atrocious
sincerity
by
philippa
into
a
life
pastorally
compounded
of
petty
sessions
and
parties
retribution
fell
when
it
was
least
expected
bernard
shute
hired
a
yacht
in
queenstown
and
one
short
week
afterwards
the
worst
had
happened
and
we
were
packing
our
things
for
a
cruise
in
her
the
only
alleviation
being
the
knowledge
that
whether
by
sea
or
land
i
was
bound
to
return
to
my
work
in
four
days
we
left
shreelane
at
twelve
a
specially
depressing
hour
for
a
start
when
breakfast
has
died
in
you
and
lunch
is
still
remote
my
last
act
before
mounting
the
dogcart
was
to
put
her
collar
and
chain
on
maria
and
immure
her
in
the
whence
as
we
drove
down
the
avenue
her
wails
rent
the
heart
of
philippa
and
rejoiced
mine
it
was
a
very
hot
day
with
a
cloudless
sky
the
dust
lay
thick
on
the
white
road
and
on
us
also
as
during
two
baking
hours
we
drove
up
and
down
the
long
hills
and
remembered
things
that
had
been
left
behind
and
grew
hungry
enough
to
eat
sandwiches
that
tasted
suspiciously
of
roast
beef
the
yacht
was
moored
in
clountiss
harbour
we
drove
through
the
village
street
a
narrow
and
unlovely
thoroughfare
studded
with
swarming
with
children
and
poultry
down
through
an
smell
of
fish
to
the
quay
thence
we
first
viewed
our
fate
a
schooner
and
the
hope
i
had
secretly
been
nourishing
that
there
was
not
wind
enough
for
her
to
start
was
dispelled
by
the
sight
of
her
topsail
going
up
more
than
ever
at
that
radiant
moment
as
the
reflection
of
the
white
sail
quivered
on
the
tranquil
blue
and
the
still
water
flattered
all
it
reproduced
like
a
fashionable
photographer
did
i
agree
with
george
herbert
advice
praise
the
sea
but
stay
on
shore
we
must
hail
her
i
suppose
i
said
drearily
i
assailed
the
such
being
her
inappropriate
name
with
desolate
cries
but
achieved
no
immediate
result
beyond
the
assembling
of
some
village
children
round
us
and
our
luggage
shute
and
the
two
ladies
was
after
screeching
here
for
the
boat
awhile
ago
volunteered
a
horrid
little
girl
whom
i
had
already
twice
frustrated
in
the
attempt
to
seat
an
infant
relative
on
our
bundle
of
rugs
timsy
hallahane
says
be
as
good
for
them
to
stay
ashore
for
there
is
as
much
wind
outside
as
out
a
candle
with
this
encouraging
statement
the
little
girl
devoted
herself
to
the
alternate
consumption
of
gooseberries
and
cockles
all
things
come
to
those
who
wait
and
to
us
arrived
at
length
the
gig
of
the
and
such
by
this
time
were
the
temperature
and
the
smells
of
the
quay
that
i
actually
welcomed
the
moment
that
found
us
leaving
it
for
the
yacht
now
sinclair
are
you
glad
we
came
remarked
philippa
as
the
clear
green
water
deepened
under
us
and
a
light
briny
air
came
coolly
round
us
with
the
motion
of
the
boat
as
she
spoke
there
was
an
outburst
of
screams
from
the
children
on
the
quay
followed
by
a
heavy
splash
oh
stop
cried
philippa
in
an
agony
one
of
them
has
fallen
in
i
can
see
its
poor
little
brown
head
is
a
dog
said
briefly
the
man
who
was
rowing
stroke
one
might
have
wished
it
had
been
that
little
girl
said
i
as
i
steered
to
the
best
of
my
ability
for
the
yacht
we
had
traversed
another
twenty
yards
or
so
when
philippa
in
a
voice
in
which
horror
and
triumph
were
strangely
blended
exclaimed
following
us
who
the
little
girl
i
asked
callously
no
returned
philippa
worse
i
looked
round
not
without
a
prevision
of
what
i
was
to
see
and
beheld
the
faithful
maria
swimming
steadily
after
us
with
her
brown
muzzle
thrust
out
in
front
of
her
ripping
through
the
reflections
like
a
plough
go
home
i
roared
standing
up
and
gesticulating
in
fury
that
i
well
know
to
be
impotent
go
home
you
brute
maria
redoubled
her
efforts
and
philippa
murmured
uncontrollably
well
she
a
dear
had
i
had
a
sword
in
my
hand
i
should
undoubtedly
have
slain
philippa
but
before
i
could
express
my
sentiments
in
any
way
a
violent
shock
flung
me
endways
on
top
of
the
man
who
was
pulling
stroke
thanks
to
maria
we
had
reached
our
destination
all
unawares
the
two
men
respectfully
awaiting
my
instructions
had
rowed
on
with
disciplined
steadiness
and
as
a
result
we
had
rammed
the
amidships
with
a
vigour
that
brought
shute
tumbling
up
the
companion
to
see
what
had
happened
oh
it
you
is
it
he
said
with
his
mouth
full
come
in
knock
delighted
to
see
you
yeates
do
apologise
nothing
like
a
hired
ship
after
all
it
quite
jolly
to
see
the
splinters
fly
shows
you
getting
your
money
worth
hullo
this
this
was
maria
feigning
exhaustion
and
noisily
treading
water
at
the
boat
side
what
poor
old
maria
wanted
to
send
her
ashore
did
he
heartless
ruffian
thus
was
maria
installed
on
board
the
and
the
element
of
fatality
had
already
begun
to
work
there
was
just
enough
wind
to
take
us
out
of
clountiss
harbour
and
with
the
last
of
the
tide
we
crept
away
to
the
west
the
party
on
board
consisted
of
our
host
sister
miss
cecilia
shute
miss
sally
knox
and
ourselves
we
sat
about
in
conventional
attitudes
in
deck
chairs
and
on
adamantine
deck
bosses
and
i
talked
to
miss
shute
with
feverish
brilliancy
and
wished
the
were
not
in
the
cabin
i
knew
the
supreme
importance
of
keeping
one
mind
occupied
but
i
dared
not
face
the
cabin
there
was
a
long
almost
imperceptible
swell
with
little
queer
seabirds
that
i
have
never
seen
before
and
trust
i
never
shall
again
dotted
about
on
its
glassy
slopes
the
looked
low
and
grey
and
dull
as
i
think
always
do
when
viewed
from
the
deep
the
breeze
that
bernard
had
promised
us
we
should
find
outside
was
barely
enough
to
keep
us
moving
the
burning
sun
of
four
focussed
its
heat
on
the
deck
bernard
stood
up
among
us
engaged
in
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
handling
the
stick
and
beamed
almost
as
offensively
as
the
sun
oh
we
slipping
along
he
said
his
odiously
healthy
face
glowing
like
copper
against
the
blazing
blue
sky
you
going
a
great
deal
faster
than
you
think
and
the
men
say
we
pick
up
a
breeze
once
we
round
the
mizen
i
made
no
reply
i
was
not
feeling
ill
merely
thoroughly
disinclined
for
conversation
miss
sally
smiled
wanly
and
closing
her
eyes
laid
her
head
on
philippa
knee
instructed
by
a
dread
freemasonry
i
knew
that
for
her
the
moment
had
come
when
she
could
no
longer
bear
to
see
the
rail
rise
slowly
above
the
horizon
and
with
an
equal
rhythmic
slowness
sink
below
it
maria
moved
restlessly
to
and
fro
panting
and
yawning
and
occasionally
rearing
herself
on
her
against
the
side
and
staring
forth
with
wild
eyes
at
the
headachy
sliding
of
the
swell
perhaps
she
was
meditating
suicide
if
so
i
sympathised
with
her
and
since
she
was
obviously
going
to
be
sick
i
trusted
that
she
would
bring
off
the
suicide
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
philippa
and
miss
shute
sat
in
unaffected
serenity
in
deck
chairs
and
stitched
at
white
things
teacloths
for
the
i
believe
things
in
themselves
a
mockery
and
talked
untiringly
with
that
singular
indifference
to
their
marine
surroundings
that
i
have
often
observed
in
ladies
who
are
not
it
always
stirs
me
afresh
to
wonder
why
they
have
not
remained
ashore
nevertheless
i
prefer
their
tranquil
and
total
lack
of
interest
in
seafaring
matters
to
the
blatant
vikingism
of
the
average
male
who
is
similarly
placed
somehow
i
know
not
how
we
crawled
onwards
and
by
about
five
we
had
rounded
the
mizen
a
gaunt
spike
of
a
headland
that
starts
up
like
a
boar
tusk
above
the
ragged
lip
of
the
irish
coast
and
the
was
beginning
to
swing
and
wallop
in
the
long
sluggish
rollers
that
the
american
liners
know
and
despise
i
was
very
far
from
despising
them
down
in
the
west
resting
on
the
sea
rim
a
purple
bank
of
clouds
lay
awaiting
the
descent
of
the
sun
as
seductively
and
as
malevolently
as
a
damp
bed
at
a
hotel
awaits
a
traveller
the
end
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
came
at
the
meal
had
been
prepared
in
the
saloon
and
thither
it
became
incumbent
on
me
to
accompany
my
hostess
and
my
wife
miss
sally
long
past
speech
opened
at
the
suggestion
of
tea
one
eye
and
disclosed
a
look
of
horror
as
i
tottered
down
the
companion
i
respected
her
good
sense
the
had
been
built
early
in
the
sixties
and
headroom
was
not
her
strong
point
neither
apparently
was
ventilation
i
began
by
dashing
my
forehead
against
the
frame
of
the
cabin
door
and
then
shattered
morally
and
physically
entered
into
the
atmosphere
of
the
pit
after
which
things
and
the
sight
of
a
plate
of
rich
cake
i
retired
in
good
order
to
my
cabin
and
began
upon
the
yanatas
i
pass
over
some
painful
intermediate
details
and
resume
at
the
moment
when
bernard
shute
woke
me
from
a
drugged
slumber
to
announce
that
dinner
was
over
it
been
raining
pretty
hard
he
said
swaying
easily
with
the
swing
of
the
yacht
but
we
got
a
clinking
breeze
and
we
ought
to
make
lurriga
harbour
there
good
anchorage
there
the
men
say
they
rather
a
lot
of
swabs
but
they
know
this
coast
and
i
do
i
took
over
with
the
ship
all
standing
where
are
we
now
i
asked
something
heartened
by
the
blessed
word
anchorage
you
running
up
sheepskin
bay
it
a
thundering
big
bay
up
at
the
far
end
of
it
and
the
night
as
black
as
the
inside
of
a
cow
dig
out
and
get
something
to
eat
and
come
on
deck
what
no
dinner
i
had
spoken
morosely
with
closed
eyes
oh
rot
you
on
an
even
keel
now
i
promised
yeates
i
make
you
dig
out
as
bad
as
a
soldier
officer
that
we
were
ferrying
to
malta
one
time
in
the
old
tamar
he
got
one
leg
out
of
his
berth
when
we
were
going
down
the
channel
and
he
was
too
sick
to
pull
it
in
again
till
we
got
to
gib
i
compromised
on
a
drink
and
some
biscuits
the
ship
was
certainly
steadier
and
i
felt
sufficiently
restored
to
climb
weakly
on
deck
it
was
by
this
time
past
ten
and
heavy
clouds
blotted
out
the
last
of
the
afterglow
and
smothered
the
stars
at
their
birth
a
wet
warm
wind
was
lashing
the
up
a
wide
estuary
the
waves
were
hunting
her
hissing
under
her
stern
racing
up
to
her
crested
with
the
white
glow
of
phosphorus
as
she
fled
before
them
i
dimly
discerned
in
the
greyness
the
more
solid
greyness
of
the
shore
the
mainsail
loomed
out
into
the
darkness
nearly
at
right
angles
to
the
yacht
with
the
boom
creaking
as
the
following
wind
gave
us
an
additional
shove
i
know
nothing
of
yacht
sailing
but
i
can
appreciate
the
grand
fact
that
in
running
before
a
wind
the
boom
is
removed
from
its
usual
sphere
of
devastation
i
sat
down
beside
a
bundle
of
rugs
that
i
had
discovered
to
be
my
wife
and
thought
of
my
whitewashed
office
at
shreelane
and
its
bare
but
stationary
floor
with
a
yearning
that
was
little
short
of
passion
miss
sally
had
long
since
succumbed
miss
shute
was
tired
and
had
turned
in
soon
after
dinner
i
suppose
she
overdone
by
the
delirious
gaiety
of
the
afternoon
said
i
acridly
in
reply
to
this
information
philippa
cautiously
poked
forth
her
head
from
the
rugs
like
a
tortoise
from
under
its
shell
to
see
that
bernard
who
was
standing
near
the
steersman
was
out
of
hearing
in
all
your
life
sinclair
she
said
impressively
you
never
knew
such
a
time
as
cecilia
and
i
have
had
down
there
we
had
to
wash
in
the
cabins
and
remake
the
beds
and
the
sheets
away
they
were
covered
with
black
and
while
we
were
doing
that
in
came
the
creature
that
calls
himself
the
steward
to
ask
if
he
might
get
something
of
his
that
he
had
left
in
miss
and
he
rooted
out
from
under
cecilia
mattress
a
pair
of
socks
and
half
a
loaf
of
bread
consolation
to
miss
shute
to
know
her
berth
has
been
well
aired
i
said
with
the
nearest
approach
to
enjoyment
i
had
known
since
i
came
on
board
and
has
sally
made
any
equally
interesting
discoveries
she
said
she
did
care
what
her
bed
was
like
she
just
dropped
into
it
i
must
say
i
am
sorry
for
her
went
on
philippa
she
hated
coming
her
mother
made
her
accept
i
wonder
if
lady
knox
will
make
her
accept
i
said
how
often
has
sally
refused
him
does
any
one
know
oh
about
once
a
week
replied
philippa
just
the
way
i
kept
on
refusing
you
you
know
something
cold
and
wet
was
thrust
into
my
hand
and
the
aroma
of
damp
dog
arose
upon
the
night
air
maria
had
issued
from
some
lair
at
the
sound
of
our
voices
and
was
now
with
palsied
tremblings
slowly
trying
to
drag
herself
on
to
my
lap
poor
thing
she
been
so
dreadfully
ill
said
philippa
do
send
her
away
sinclair
shute
found
her
lying
on
his
berth
not
able
to
move
did
you
mr
shute
she
found
out
that
she
was
able
to
move
said
bernard
who
had
crossed
to
our
side
of
the
deck
it
was
somehow
borne
in
upon
her
when
i
got
at
her
with
a
i
would
advise
you
to
keep
her
in
your
lap
yeates
she
stole
half
a
ham
after
dinner
and
she
might
take
a
notion
to
make
the
only
reparation
in
her
power
i
stood
up
and
stretched
myself
stiffly
the
wind
was
freshening
and
though
the
growing
smoothness
of
the
water
told
that
we
were
making
shelter
of
some
kind
for
all
that
i
could
see
of
land
we
might
as
well
have
been
in
the
heaving
lift
of
the
deck
under
my
feet
and
the
lurching
swing
when
a
stronger
gust
filled
the
ghostly
sails
were
more
disquieting
to
me
in
suggestion
than
in
reality
and
to
my
surprise
i
found
something
almost
enjoyable
in
rushing
through
darkness
at
the
pace
at
which
we
were
going
we
a
small
bit
short
of
the
mouth
of
lurriga
harbour
yet
sir
said
the
man
who
was
steering
in
reply
to
a
question
from
bernard
i
can
see
the
shore
well
enough
sure
i
know
every
yard
of
wather
in
the
bay
as
he
spoke
he
sat
down
abruptly
and
violently
so
did
bernard
so
did
i
the
bundle
that
contained
philippa
collapsed
upon
maria
main
sheet
bellowed
bernard
on
his
feet
in
an
instant
as
the
boom
swung
in
and
out
again
with
a
terrific
jerk
we
ashore
in
response
to
this
order
three
men
in
succession
fell
over
me
while
i
was
still
struggling
on
the
deck
and
something
that
was
either
philippa
elbow
or
the
acutest
angle
of
maria
skull
hit
me
in
the
face
as
i
found
my
feet
the
cabin
skylight
was
suddenly
illuminated
by
a
wavering
glare
i
got
across
the
slanting
deck
somehow
through
the
confusion
of
shouting
men
and
the
flapping
thunder
of
the
sails
and
saw
through
the
skylight
a
gush
of
flame
rising
from
a
pool
of
fire
around
an
overturned
lamp
on
the
i
avalanched
down
the
companion
and
was
squandered
like
an
avalanche
on
the
floor
at
the
foot
of
it
even
as
i
fell
mccarthy
the
steward
dragged
the
strip
of
carpet
from
the
cabin
floor
and
threw
it
on
the
blaze
i
found
myself
in
some
unexplained
way
snatching
a
railway
rug
from
miss
shute
and
applying
it
to
the
same
purpose
and
in
seconds
we
had
smothered
the
flame
and
were
left
in
total
darkness
the
most
striking
feature
of
the
situation
was
the
immovability
of
the
yacht
great
ned
said
mccarthy
invoking
i
know
not
what
heathen
deity
it
is
on
the
bottom
of
the
say
we
are
well
whether
or
no
thank
god
we
have
the
fire
quinched
we
were
not
so
far
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
but
during
the
next
ten
minutes
the
chances
seemed
in
favour
of
our
getting
there
the
yacht
had
run
her
bows
upon
a
sunken
ridge
of
rock
and
after
a
period
of
feminine
indecision
as
to
whether
she
were
going
to
slide
off
again
or
roll
over
into
deep
water
she
elected
to
stay
where
she
was
and
the
gig
was
lowered
with
all
speed
in
order
to
tow
her
off
before
the
tide
left
her
my
recollection
of
this
interval
is
but
hazy
but
i
can
certify
that
in
ten
minutes
i
had
swept
together
an
assortment
of
necessaries
and
knotted
them
into
my
counterpane
had
broken
the
string
of
my
and
lost
my
silver
matchbox
had
found
and
put
them
in
my
pocket
had
carted
all
the
luggage
on
deck
had
then
applied
myself
to
the
manly
duty
of
reassuring
the
ladies
and
had
found
miss
shute
merely
bored
philippa
enthusiastically
anxious
to
be
allowed
to
help
to
pull
the
gig
and
miss
sally
radiantly
restored
to
health
and
spirits
by
the
cessation
of
movement
and
the
probability
of
an
early
escape
from
the
yacht
the
rain
had
with
its
usual
opportuneness
begun
again
we
stood
in
it
under
umbrellas
and
watched
the
gig
jumping
on
its
like
a
dog
on
a
string
as
the
crew
plied
the
labouring
oar
in
futile
endeavour
to
move
the
we
had
run
on
the
rock
at
and
the
increasing
slant
of
the
deck
as
the
tide
fell
brought
home
to
us
the
pleasing
probability
that
at
low
water
viz
about
we
should
roll
off
the
rock
and
go
to
the
bottom
had
bernard
shute
wished
to
show
himself
in
the
most
advantageous
light
to
miss
sally
he
could
scarcely
have
bettered
the
situation
i
looked
on
in
helpless
respect
while
he
whom
i
had
known
as
the
scourge
of
the
hunting
field
the
terror
of
the
shooting
party
rose
to
the
top
of
a
difficult
position
and
kept
there
and
my
respect
was
if
possible
increased
by
the
presence
of
mind
with
which
he
availed
himself
of
all
critical
moments
to
place
a
protecting
arm
round
miss
knox
by
about
the
two
gaffs
with
which
bernard
had
contrived
to
shore
up
the
slowly
heeling
yacht
began
to
show
signs
of
yielding
and
in
approved
shipwreck
fashion
we
took
to
the
boats
the
yacht
crew
in
the
gig
remaining
in
attendance
on
what
seemed
likely
to
be
the
last
moments
of
the
while
we
in
the
dinghy
sought
for
the
harbour
owing
to
the
tilt
of
the
yacht
deck
and
the
roughness
of
the
broken
water
round
her
getting
into
the
boat
was
no
mean
feat
of
gymnastics
miss
sally
did
it
like
a
bird
alighting
in
the
inevitable
arms
of
bernard
miss
shute
followed
very
badly
but
by
innate
force
of
character
successfully
philippa
who
was
enjoying
every
moment
of
her
shipwreck
came
last
launching
herself
into
the
dinghy
with
my
silver
clutched
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
the
i
heard
the
hollow
clank
of
its
tin
cups
as
she
sprang
and
appreciated
the
heroism
with
which
bernard
received
one
of
its
corners
in
his
waist
how
or
when
maria
left
the
yacht
i
know
not
but
when
i
applied
myself
to
the
bow
oar
i
led
off
with
three
crabs
owing
to
the
devotion
with
which
she
thrust
her
head
into
my
lap
i
am
no
judge
of
these
matters
but
in
my
opinion
we
ought
to
have
been
swamped
several
times
during
that
row
there
was
nothing
but
the
phosphorus
of
breaking
waves
to
tell
us
where
the
rocks
were
and
nothing
to
show
where
the
harbour
was
except
a
solitary
light
a
masthead
light
as
we
supposed
the
skipper
had
assured
us
that
we
could
not
go
wrong
if
we
kept
a
westerly
course
with
a
little
northing
in
it
but
it
seemed
simpler
to
steer
for
the
light
and
we
did
so
the
dinghy
climbed
along
over
the
waves
with
an
agility
that
was
safer
than
it
felt
the
rain
fell
without
haste
and
without
rest
the
oars
were
as
inflexible
as
crowbars
and
somewhat
resembled
them
in
shape
and
weight
nevertheless
it
was
elysium
when
compared
with
the
afternoon
leisure
of
the
deck
of
the
at
last
we
came
unexplainably
into
smooth
water
and
it
was
at
about
this
time
that
we
were
first
aware
that
the
darkness
was
less
dense
than
it
had
been
and
that
the
rain
had
ceased
by
imperceptible
degrees
a
greyness
touched
the
back
of
the
waves
more
a
dreariness
than
a
dawn
but
more
welcome
than
thousands
of
gold
and
silver
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
and
discerned
vague
bulky
things
ahead
as
i
did
so
my
oar
was
suddenly
wrapped
in
seaweed
we
crept
on
maria
stood
up
with
her
paws
on
the
gunwale
and
whined
in
high
agitation
the
dark
objects
ahead
resolved
themselves
into
rocks
and
without
more
ado
maria
pitched
herself
into
the
water
in
half
a
minute
we
heard
her
shaking
herself
on
shore
we
slid
on
the
water
swelled
under
the
dinghy
and
lifted
her
keel
on
to
grating
gravel
we
could
have
done
it
better
if
we
been
the
hydrographer
royal
said
bernard
wading
in
a
light
wash
of
foam
with
the
painter
in
his
hand
but
all
the
same
that
masthead
light
is
some
one
bedroom
candle
we
landed
hauled
up
the
boat
and
then
feebly
sat
down
on
our
belongings
to
review
the
situation
and
maria
came
and
shook
herself
over
each
of
us
in
turn
we
had
run
into
a
little
cove
guided
by
the
philanthropic
beam
of
a
candle
in
the
upper
window
of
a
house
about
a
hundred
yards
away
the
candle
still
burned
on
and
the
anæmic
daylight
exhibited
to
us
our
surroundings
and
we
debated
as
to
whether
we
could
at
present
ourselves
as
objects
of
compassion
to
the
owner
of
the
candle
i
need
hardly
say
that
it
was
the
ladies
who
decided
on
making
the
attempt
having
like
most
of
their
sex
a
courage
incomparably
superior
to
ours
in
such
matters
bernard
and
i
had
not
a
grain
of
genuine
compunction
in
our
souls
but
we
failed
in
nerve
we
trailed
up
from
the
cove
laden
with
emigrants
bundles
stumbling
on
wet
rocks
in
the
and
succeeded
in
making
our
way
to
the
house
it
was
a
small
building
of
that
hideous
breed
of
architecture
usually
dedicated
to
the
rectories
of
the
irish
church
we
felt
that
there
was
something
friendly
in
the
presence
of
a
pair
of
carpet
slippers
in
the
porch
but
there
was
a
hint
of
exclusiveness
in
the
fact
that
there
was
no
knocker
and
that
the
bell
was
broken
the
light
still
burned
in
the
upper
window
and
with
a
faltering
hand
i
flung
gravel
at
the
glass
this
summons
was
appallingly
responded
to
by
a
shriek
there
was
a
flutter
of
white
at
the
panes
and
the
candle
was
extinguished
come
away
exclaimed
miss
shute
it
a
lunatic
asylum
we
stood
our
ground
however
and
presently
heard
a
footstep
within
a
blind
was
poked
aside
in
another
window
and
we
were
inspected
by
an
unseen
inmate
then
some
one
came
downstairs
and
the
was
opened
by
a
small
man
with
a
bald
head
and
a
long
sandy
beard
he
was
attired
in
a
brief
and
on
his
shoulder
sat
like
an
angry
ghost
a
large
white
cockatoo
its
crest
was
up
on
end
its
beak
was
a
good
two
inches
long
and
curved
like
a
malay
kris
its
claws
gripped
the
little
man
shoulder
maria
uttered
in
the
background
a
low
and
thunderous
growl
do
take
any
notice
of
the
bird
please
said
the
little
man
nervously
seeing
our
united
gaze
fixed
upon
this
apparition
extremely
fierce
if
annoyed
the
majority
of
our
party
here
melted
away
to
either
side
of
the
and
i
was
left
to
do
the
explaining
the
tale
of
our
misfortunes
had
its
due
effect
and
we
were
ushered
into
a
small
our
host
holding
open
the
door
for
us
like
a
nightmare
footman
with
bare
shins
a
bald
head
and
an
unclean
spirit
swaying
on
his
shoulder
he
opened
the
shutters
and
we
sat
decorously
round
the
room
as
at
an
afternoon
party
while
the
situation
was
further
expounded
on
both
sides
our
entertainer
indeed
favoured
us
with
the
leading
items
of
his
family
history
amongst
them
the
facts
that
he
was
a
fahy
from
cork
who
had
taken
somebody
rectory
for
the
summer
and
had
been
prevailed
on
by
some
of
his
patients
to
permit
them
to
join
him
as
paying
guests
i
said
it
was
a
lunatic
asylum
murmured
miss
shute
to
me
in
point
of
fact
went
on
our
host
there
is
an
empty
room
in
the
house
which
is
why
i
can
only
offer
your
party
the
use
of
this
room
and
the
kitchen
fire
which
i
make
a
point
of
keeping
burning
all
night
he
leaned
back
complacently
in
his
chair
and
crossed
his
legs
then
obviously
remembering
his
costume
sat
bolt
upright
again
we
owed
the
guiding
beams
of
the
candle
to
the
owner
of
the
cockatoo
an
old
buck
who
was
we
gathered
the
most
paying
of
all
the
patients
and
also
obviously
the
one
most
feared
and
cherished
by
fahy
she
has
a
candle
burning
all
night
for
the
bird
and
her
door
open
to
let
him
walk
about
the
house
when
he
likes
said
fahy
indeed
i
may
say
her
passion
for
him
amounts
to
dementia
he
very
fond
of
me
and
fahy
always
telling
me
i
should
be
thankful
as
whatever
he
did
we
be
bound
to
put
up
with
it
fahy
had
evidently
a
turn
for
conversation
that
was
unaffected
by
circumstance
the
first
beams
of
the
early
sun
were
lighting
up
the
rep
chair
covers
before
the
door
closed
upon
his
brown
and
upon
the
stately
white
back
of
the
cockatoo
and
the
demoniac
possession
of
laughter
that
had
wrought
in
us
during
the
interview
burst
forth
unchecked
it
was
most
painful
and
exhausting
as
such
laughter
always
is
but
by
far
the
most
serious
part
of
it
was
that
miss
sally
who
was
sitting
in
the
window
somehow
drove
her
elbow
through
a
pane
of
glass
and
bernard
in
pulling
down
the
blind
to
conceal
the
damage
tore
it
off
the
roller
there
followed
on
this
catastrophe
a
period
during
which
reason
tottered
and
maria
barked
furiously
philippa
was
the
first
to
pull
herself
together
and
to
suggest
an
adjournment
to
the
kitchen
fire
that
in
honour
of
the
paying
guests
was
never
quenched
and
respecting
the
repose
of
the
household
we
proceeded
thither
with
a
stealth
that
convinced
maria
we
were
engaged
in
a
rat
hunt
the
boots
of
paying
guests
littered
the
floor
the
debris
of
their
last
repast
covered
the
table
a
cat
in
some
unseen
fastness
crooned
a
war
song
to
maria
who
feigned
unconsciousness
and
fell
to
scientific
research
in
the
scullery
we
roasted
our
boots
at
the
range
and
bernard
with
all
a
gift
for
exploration
and
theft
prowled
in
noisome
purlieus
and
emerged
with
a
jug
of
milk
and
a
lump
of
salt
butter
no
one
who
has
not
been
a
burglar
can
at
all
realise
what
it
was
to
roam
through
basement
storey
with
the
rookery
of
paying
guests
asleep
above
and
to
feel
that
so
far
we
had
repaid
his
confidence
by
breaking
a
pane
of
glass
and
a
blind
and
putting
the
scullery
tap
out
of
order
i
have
always
maintained
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
it
before
i
touched
it
but
the
fact
remains
that
when
i
had
filled
kettle
no
human
power
could
prevail
upon
it
to
stop
flowing
for
all
i
know
to
the
contrary
it
is
running
still
it
was
in
the
course
of
our
furtive
return
to
the
that
we
were
again
confronted
by
buck
cockatoo
it
was
standing
in
malign
meditation
on
the
stairs
and
on
seeing
us
it
rose
without
a
word
of
warning
upon
the
wing
and
with
a
long
screech
flung
itself
at
miss
sally
head
which
a
ray
of
sunlight
had
chanced
to
illumine
there
was
a
moment
of
stampede
as
the
selected
victim
pursued
by
the
cockatoo
fled
into
the
two
chairs
were
upset
one
i
think
broken
miss
sally
enveloped
herself
in
a
window
curtain
philippa
and
miss
shute
effaced
themselves
beneath
a
table
the
cockatoo
foiled
of
its
prey
skimmed
still
screeching
round
the
ceiling
it
was
bernard
who
with
a
drove
the
enemy
from
the
room
there
was
only
a
chink
of
the
door
open
but
the
cockatoo
turned
on
his
side
as
he
flew
and
swung
through
it
like
a
woodcock
we
slammed
the
door
behind
him
and
at
the
same
instant
there
came
a
thumping
on
the
floor
overhead
muffled
yet
peremptory
that
mrs
buck
said
miss
shute
crawling
from
under
the
table
the
room
over
this
is
the
one
that
had
the
candle
in
it
we
sat
for
a
time
in
awful
stillness
but
nothing
further
happened
save
a
distant
shriek
overhead
that
told
the
cockatoo
had
sought
and
found
sanctuary
in
his
owner
room
we
had
tea
and
then
one
by
one
despite
the
amazing
discomfort
of
the
chairs
we
dozed
off
to
sleep
it
was
at
about
five
that
i
woke
with
a
stiff
neck
and
an
uneasy
remembrance
that
i
had
last
seen
maria
in
the
kitchen
the
others
looking
each
of
them
about
twenty
years
older
than
their
age
slept
in
various
attitudes
of
exhaustion
bernard
opened
his
eyes
as
i
stole
forth
to
look
for
maria
but
none
of
the
ladies
awoke
i
went
down
the
passage
that
led
to
the
kitchen
stairs
and
there
on
a
mat
regarding
me
with
intelligent
affection
was
maria
but
what
oh
what
was
the
white
thing
that
lay
between
her
forepaws
the
situation
was
too
serious
to
be
coped
with
alone
i
fled
noiselessly
back
to
the
and
put
my
head
in
eyes
blessed
be
the
light
sleep
of
sailors
opened
again
and
there
was
that
in
mine
that
summoned
him
forth
blessed
also
be
the
light
step
of
sailors
we
took
the
corpse
from
maria
withholding
perforce
the
language
and
the
slaughtering
that
our
hearts
ached
to
bestow
for
a
minute
or
two
our
eyes
communed
i
get
the
kitchen
shovel
breathed
bernard
you
open
the
a
moment
later
we
passed
like
spirits
into
the
open
air
and
on
into
a
little
garden
at
the
end
of
the
house
maria
followed
us
licking
her
lips
there
were
beds
of
nasturtiums
and
of
purple
stocks
and
of
marigolds
we
chose
a
bed
of
stocks
a
plump
bed
that
looked
like
easy
digging
the
windows
were
all
tightly
shut
and
shuttered
and
i
took
the
cockatoo
from
under
my
coat
and
hid
it
temporarily
behind
a
box
border
bernard
had
brought
a
shovel
and
a
coal
scoop
we
dug
like
badgers
at
eighteen
inches
we
got
down
into
shale
and
stones
and
the
coal
scoop
struck
work
never
mind
said
bernard
we
plant
the
stocks
on
top
of
him
it
was
a
lovely
morning
with
a
blue
sky
and
a
light
northerly
breeze
as
we
returned
to
the
house
we
looked
across
the
wavelets
of
the
little
cove
and
saw
above
the
rocky
point
round
which
we
had
groped
last
night
a
triangular
white
patch
moving
slowly
along
the
tide
lifted
her
said
bernard
standing
he
looked
at
buck
window
and
at
me
yeates
he
whispered
let
quit
it
was
now
barely
six
and
not
a
soul
was
stirring
we
woke
the
ladies
and
convinced
them
of
the
high
importance
of
catching
the
tide
bernard
left
a
note
on
the
hall
table
for
fahy
a
beautiful
note
of
and
gratitude
and
apology
for
the
broken
window
for
which
he
begged
to
enclose
no
allusion
was
made
to
the
other
casualties
as
we
neared
the
strand
he
found
an
occasion
to
say
to
me
i
put
in
a
postscript
that
i
thought
it
best
to
mention
that
i
had
seen
the
cockatoo
in
the
garden
and
hoped
it
would
get
back
all
right
that
quite
true
you
know
but
look
here
whatever
you
do
you
must
keep
it
all
dark
from
the
ladies
at
this
juncture
maria
overtook
us
with
the
cockatoo
in
her
mouth
xi
occasional
licenses
it
out
of
the
question
i
said
looking
forbiddingly
at
moloney
through
the
spokes
of
the
bicycle
that
i
was
pumping
up
outside
the
grocer
in
skebawn
well
indeed
major
yeates
said
moloney
advancing
excitedly
and
placing
on
the
nickel
plating
a
hand
that
i
had
good
and
recent
cause
to
know
was
warm
sure
i
know
well
that
if
th
angel
gabriel
came
down
from
heaven
looking
for
a
license
for
the
races
your
honour
would
give
it
to
him
without
a
charackther
but
as
for
michael
sure
the
world
knows
what
michael
is
i
had
been
waiting
for
philippa
for
already
nearly
and
my
temper
was
not
at
its
best
character
or
no
character
moloney
said
i
with
asperity
the
magistrates
have
settled
to
give
no
occasional
licenses
and
if
michael
were
as
sober
as
is
it
sober
god
help
us
exclaimed
moloney
with
an
upward
rolling
of
her
eye
to
the
recording
angel
i
tell
your
honour
the
truth
i
his
wife
now
fifteen
years
and
i
never
seen
the
sign
of
dhrink
on
michael
only
once
and
that
was
when
he
went
out
helping
timsy
ryan
to
whitewash
his
house
and
timsy
and
himself
had
a
couple
o
pots
o
porther
and
look
he
was
as
little
used
to
it
that
his
head
got
light
and
he
walked
away
out
to
dhrive
in
the
cows
and
it
no
more
than
eleven
in
the
day
and
the
cows
the
craytures
as
much
surprised
goin
hither
and
over
the
four
corners
of
the
road
from
him
faith
ye
have
to
laugh
says
i
to
him
dhrunk
am
says
he
and
the
tears
rained
from
his
eyes
i
turned
the
cows
from
him
home
i
says
lie
down
on
willy
tom
bed
at
this
affecting
point
my
wife
came
out
of
the
grocer
with
a
large
parcel
to
be
strapped
to
my
handlebar
and
the
history
of
solitary
lapse
from
sobriety
got
no
further
than
willy
tom
bed
you
see
i
said
to
philippa
as
we
bicycled
quietly
home
through
the
hot
june
afternoon
we
settled
we
give
no
licenses
for
the
sports
why
even
young
sheehy
who
owns
three
pubs
in
skebawn
came
to
me
and
said
he
hoped
the
magistrates
would
be
firm
about
it
as
these
licenses
were
quite
unnecessary
and
only
led
to
drunkenness
and
fighting
and
every
man
on
the
bench
has
joined
in
promising
not
to
grant
any
how
nice
dear
said
philippa
absently
do
you
know
mcdonnell
can
only
let
me
have
three
dozen
cups
and
saucers
i
wonder
if
that
will
be
enough
do
you
mean
to
say
you
expect
three
dozen
people
said
i
oh
it
always
well
to
be
prepared
replied
my
wife
evasively
during
the
next
few
days
i
realised
the
true
inwardness
of
what
it
was
to
be
prepared
for
an
entertainment
of
this
kind
games
were
not
at
a
high
level
in
my
district
football
of
a
wild
guerilla
species
was
waged
intermittently
blended
in
some
inextricable
way
with
home
rule
and
a
brass
band
and
on
sundays
gatherings
of
young
men
rolled
a
heavy
round
stone
along
the
roads
a
rudimentary
form
of
sport
whose
fascination
lay
primarily
in
the
fact
that
it
was
illegal
and
in
lesser
degree
in
betting
on
the
length
of
each
roll
i
had
had
a
period
of
enthusiasm
during
which
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
the
apostle
of
cricket
in
the
neighbourhood
but
my
mission
dwindled
to
single
wicket
with
peter
cadogan
who
was
indulgent
but
bored
and
i
swiped
the
ball
through
the
window
and
some
one
took
one
of
the
stumps
to
poke
the
laundry
fire
once
a
year
however
on
that
festival
of
the
roman
catholic
church
which
is
familiarly
known
as
pether
and
paul
day
the
district
was
wont
to
make
a
spasmodic
effort
at
athletic
sports
which
were
duly
patronised
by
the
gentry
and
promoted
by
the
publicans
and
this
year
the
honour
of
a
green
rosette
was
conferred
upon
me
philippa
genius
for
hospitality
here
saw
its
chance
and
broke
forth
into
unbridled
in
connection
with
the
sports
even
involving
me
in
the
hire
of
a
tent
the
conveyance
of
chairs
and
tables
and
other
large
operations
it
chanced
that
flurry
knox
had
on
this
occasion
lent
the
fields
for
the
sports
with
the
proviso
that
and
a
were
to
be
added
to
the
usual
programme
flurry
participation
in
events
of
this
kind
seldom
failed
to
be
of
an
inflaming
character
as
he
and
i
planted
larch
spars
for
the
high
jump
and
stuck
into
hurdles
locally
known
as
hurrls
and
skirmished
hourly
with
people
who
wanted
to
sell
drink
on
the
course
i
thought
that
my
next
summer
leave
would
singularly
coincide
with
the
festival
consecrated
to
peter
and
paul
we
made
a
grand
stand
of
quite
four
feet
high
out
of
old
which
smelt
worse
and
worse
as
the
day
wore
on
but
was
none
the
less
as
sought
after
by
those
for
whom
it
was
not
intended
as
is
the
royal
enclosure
at
ascot
we
broke
gaps
in
all
the
fences
to
allow
carriages
on
to
the
ground
we
armed
a
gang
of
the
worst
blackguards
in
skebawn
with
to
keep
the
course
and
felt
that
organisation
could
go
no
further
the
momentous
day
of
pether
and
paul
opened
badly
with
heavy
clouds
and
every
indication
of
rain
but
after
a
few
thunder
showers
things
brightened
and
it
seemed
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
the
weather
might
hold
up
when
i
got
down
to
the
course
on
the
day
of
the
sports
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
a
tent
of
that
peculiar
filthy
grey
that
usually
enshrines
the
sale
of
porter
with
an
array
of
barrels
in
a
crate
beside
it
i
bore
down
upon
it
in
all
the
indignant
majesty
of
the
law
and
in
so
doing
came
upon
flurry
knox
who
was
engaged
in
flogging
boys
off
the
grand
stand
sheehy
gone
one
better
than
you
he
said
without
taking
any
trouble
to
conceal
the
fact
that
he
was
amused
sheehy
i
said
why
sheehy
was
the
man
who
went
to
every
magistrate
in
the
country
to
ask
them
to
refuse
a
license
for
the
sports
yes
he
took
some
trouble
to
prevent
any
one
else
having
a
look
in
replied
flurry
he
asked
every
magistrate
but
one
and
that
was
the
one
that
gave
him
the
license
you
do
mean
to
say
that
it
was
you
i
demanded
in
high
wrath
and
suspicion
remembering
that
sheehy
bred
horses
and
that
my
friend
knox
was
a
person
of
infinite
resource
in
the
matter
of
a
deal
well
well
said
flurry
rearranging
a
disordered
and
me
that
a
and
sprained
my
ankle
a
month
ago
with
running
downstairs
at
my
grandmother
to
be
in
time
for
prayers
where
the
use
of
a
good
character
in
this
country
not
much
when
you
keep
it
eating
its
head
off
for
want
of
exercise
i
retorted
but
if
it
was
you
who
was
it
do
you
remember
old
moriarty
out
at
castle
ire
i
remembered
him
extremely
well
as
one
of
those
representatives
of
the
people
with
whom
a
paternal
government
had
leavened
the
effete
ranks
of
the
irish
magistracy
well
resumed
flurry
that
license
was
as
good
as
a
note
in
his
pocket
i
permitted
myself
a
comment
on
moriarty
suitable
to
the
occasion
oh
that
nothing
said
flurry
easily
he
told
me
one
day
when
he
was
half
screwed
that
his
commission
of
the
peace
was
worth
a
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
to
him
in
turkeys
and
whisky
and
he
was
telling
the
truth
for
once
at
this
point
flurry
eye
wandered
and
following
its
direction
i
saw
lady
knox
smart
cleaving
its
way
through
the
throng
of
country
people
lurching
over
the
ups
and
downs
of
the
field
like
a
ship
in
a
sea
i
was
too
blind
to
make
out
the
component
parts
of
the
white
froth
that
crowned
it
on
top
and
seethed
forth
from
it
when
it
had
taken
up
a
position
near
the
tent
in
which
philippa
was
even
now
propping
the
legs
of
the
but
from
the
fact
that
flurry
addressed
himself
to
the
door
i
argued
that
miss
sally
had
gone
inside
lady
knox
manner
had
something
more
than
its
usual
bleakness
she
had
brought
as
she
promised
a
large
contingent
but
from
the
way
that
the
strangers
within
her
gates
melted
impalpably
and
left
me
to
deal
with
her
i
drew
the
further
deduction
that
all
was
not
well
did
you
ever
in
your
life
see
such
a
gang
of
women
as
i
have
brought
with
me
she
began
with
her
wonted
directness
as
i
piloted
her
to
the
grand
stand
and
placed
her
on
the
stoutest
looking
of
the
i
have
no
patience
with
men
who
yacht
bernard
shute
has
gone
off
to
the
clyde
and
i
had
counted
on
his
being
a
man
at
my
dance
next
week
i
suppose
you
tell
me
you
going
away
too
i
assured
lady
knox
that
i
would
be
a
man
to
the
best
of
my
ability
this
is
the
last
dance
i
shall
give
went
on
her
ladyship
unappeased
the
men
in
this
country
consist
of
children
and
cads
i
admitted
that
we
were
but
a
poor
lot
but
i
said
miss
sally
told
me
sally
a
fool
said
lady
knox
with
a
falcon
eye
at
her
daughter
who
happened
to
be
talking
to
her
distant
kinsman
mr
flurry
of
that
ilk
the
races
had
by
this
time
begun
with
a
competition
known
as
the
hop
step
and
lep
this
judging
by
the
yells
was
a
highly
interesting
display
but
as
it
was
conducted
between
two
impervious
rows
of
onlookers
the
aristocracy
on
the
saw
nothing
save
the
occasional
purple
face
of
a
competitor
starting
into
view
above
the
wall
of
backs
like
a
for
me
however
the
odorous
sanctuary
of
the
was
not
to
be
i
left
it
guarded
by
slipper
with
a
of
dimensions
as
disreputable
an
object
as
could
be
seen
out
of
low
comedy
with
some
one
old
white
cords
on
his
bandy
legs
three
sizes
too
big
for
him
and
a
black
eye
the
small
boys
fled
before
him
in
the
glory
of
his
office
he
would
have
flailed
his
own
mother
off
the
had
occasion
served
i
had
an
afternoon
of
decidedly
mixed
enjoyment
my
stewardship
blossomed
forth
like
aaron
rod
and
added
to
itself
the
duties
of
starter
handicapper
general
referee
and
besides
which
i
from
time
to
time
strove
with
emissaries
who
came
from
philippa
with
messages
about
water
and
kettles
flurry
and
i
had
to
deal
with
the
our
brothers
in
office
being
otherwise
engaged
at
sheehy
a
task
of
many
difficulties
chiefest
being
that
the
spectators
all
swept
forward
at
the
word
go
and
ran
the
race
with
the
competitors
yelling
curses
blessings
and
advice
upon
them
taking
short
cuts
over
anything
and
everybody
and
mingling
inextricably
with
the
finish
by
fervent
applications
of
the
whips
the
course
was
to
some
extent
purged
for
the
and
it
would
i
believe
have
been
a
triumph
of
handicapping
had
not
an
unforeseen
disaster
overtaken
the
favourite
old
knox
boy
whether
as
was
alleged
his
braces
had
or
had
not
been
tampered
with
by
a
rival
was
a
matter
that
the
referee
had
subsequently
to
deal
with
in
the
thick
of
a
free
fight
but
the
painful
fact
remained
that
in
the
course
of
the
first
lap
what
were
described
as
his
galluses
abruptly
severed
their
connection
with
the
garments
for
whose
safety
they
were
responsible
and
the
favourite
was
obliged
to
seek
seclusion
in
the
crowd
the
followed
close
on
this
and
had
the
excellent
effect
of
drawing
away
like
a
blister
the
inflammation
set
up
by
the
grievances
of
the
boy
i
can
not
at
this
moment
remember
of
how
many
men
each
team
consisted
my
sole
aim
was
to
keep
the
numbers
even
and
to
baffle
the
volunteers
who
in
an
ecstasy
of
sympathy
attached
themselves
to
the
tail
of
the
rope
at
moments
when
their
champions
weakened
the
rival
forces
dug
their
heels
in
and
tugged
in
an
uproar
that
drew
forth
the
innermost
line
of
customers
from
sheehy
porter
tent
and
even
attracted
the
quality
from
the
haven
of
the
slipper
in
the
capacity
of
squire
of
dames
pioneering
lady
knox
through
the
crowd
with
the
and
with
language
whose
nature
was
providentially
veiled
for
the
most
part
by
the
din
the
continued
unabated
one
team
was
getting
the
worst
of
it
but
hung
doggedly
on
sinking
lower
and
lower
till
they
gradually
sat
down
nothing
short
of
the
trump
of
judgment
could
have
conveyed
to
them
that
they
were
breaking
rules
and
both
teams
settled
down
by
slow
degrees
on
to
their
sides
with
the
rope
under
them
and
their
heels
still
planted
in
the
ground
bringing
about
complete
deadlock
i
do
not
know
the
record
duration
for
a
but
i
can
certify
that
the
cullinagh
and
knockranny
teams
lay
on
the
ground
at
full
tension
for
like
men
in
apoplectic
fits
each
man
with
his
respective
adherents
howling
over
him
blessing
him
and
adjuring
him
to
continue
with
my
own
nauseated
eyes
i
saw
a
bearded
countryman
obviously
one
of
sheehy
best
customers
fling
himself
on
his
knees
beside
one
of
the
combatants
and
kiss
his
crimson
and
streaming
face
in
a
rapture
of
encouragement
as
he
shoved
unsteadily
past
me
on
his
return
journey
to
sheehy
i
heard
him
informing
a
friend
that
he
cried
a
handful
over
danny
mulloy
when
he
seen
the
poor
brave
boy
so
shtubborn
and
indeed
he
could
say
why
he
cried
for
ye
cry
suggested
the
friend
well
just
that
i
suppose
returned
danny
mulloy
admirer
resignedly
indeed
if
it
was
only
two
cocks
ye
seen
fightin
on
the
road
yer
heart
take
part
with
one
o
them
i
had
begun
to
realise
that
i
might
as
well
abandon
the
and
occupy
myself
elsewhere
when
my
wife
much
harassed
messenger
brought
me
the
portentous
tidings
that
yeates
wanted
me
at
the
tent
at
once
when
i
arrived
i
found
the
tent
literally
bulging
with
philippa
guests
lady
knox
seated
on
a
hamper
was
taking
off
her
gloves
and
loudly
announcing
her
desire
for
tea
and
philippa
with
a
flushed
face
and
a
crooked
hat
breathed
into
my
ear
the
awful
news
that
both
the
cream
and
the
milk
had
been
forgotten
but
flurry
knox
says
he
can
get
me
some
she
went
on
he
gone
to
send
people
to
milk
a
cow
that
lives
near
here
go
out
and
see
if
coming
i
went
out
and
found
in
the
first
instance
cadogan
who
greeted
me
with
the
prayer
that
the
divil
might
roast
julia
mccarthy
that
legged
it
away
to
the
races
like
a
wild
goose
and
left
the
cream
afther
her
on
the
servants
hall
table
sure
misther
flurry
gone
looking
for
a
cow
and
what
cow
would
there
be
in
a
backwards
place
like
this
and
look
at
me
shtriving
to
keep
the
kettle
simpering
on
the
fire
and
not
as
much
coals
undher
it
as
redden
a
pipe
where
mr
knox
i
asked
himself
and
slipper
galloping
the
counthry
like
the
deer
i
believe
it
to
the
house
above
they
went
sir
i
followed
up
a
rocky
hill
to
the
house
above
and
there
found
flurry
and
slipper
engaged
in
the
patriarchal
task
of
driving
two
brace
of
coupled
and
spancelled
goats
into
a
shed
it
the
best
we
can
do
said
flurry
briefly
there
is
a
cow
to
be
found
and
the
people
are
all
down
at
the
sports
be
d
d
to
you
slipper
do
let
them
go
from
you
as
the
goats
charged
and
doubled
like
football
players
but
goats
milk
i
said
paralysed
by
horrible
memories
of
what
tea
used
to
taste
like
at
gib
they
never
know
it
said
flurry
cornering
a
venerable
nanny
here
hold
this
divil
and
hold
her
tight
i
have
no
time
to
dwell
upon
the
pastoral
scene
that
followed
suffice
it
to
say
that
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
of
scorching
profanity
from
slipper
and
incessant
warfare
with
the
goats
the
latter
had
reluctantly
yielded
two
small
jugfuls
and
the
dairymaids
had
exhibited
a
nerve
and
skill
in
their
trade
that
won
my
lasting
respect
i
knew
i
could
trust
mr
knox
said
philippa
with
shining
eyes
as
we
presented
her
with
the
two
foaming
beakers
i
suppose
a
man
is
never
a
hero
to
his
wife
but
if
she
could
have
realised
the
bruises
on
my
legs
i
think
she
would
have
reserved
a
blessing
for
me
also
what
was
thought
of
the
goats
milk
i
gathered
symptomatically
from
a
certain
fixity
of
expression
that
accompanied
the
first
sip
of
the
tea
and
from
observing
that
comparatively
few
ventured
on
second
cups
i
also
noted
that
after
a
brief
conversation
with
flurry
miss
sally
poured
hers
secretly
on
to
the
grass
lady
knox
had
throughout
the
day
preserved
an
aspect
so
threatening
that
no
change
was
perceptible
in
her
demeanour
in
the
throng
of
hungry
guests
i
did
not
for
some
time
notice
that
knox
had
withdrawn
until
something
in
miss
sally
eye
summoned
me
to
her
and
she
told
me
she
had
a
message
from
him
for
me
could
we
come
outside
she
said
outside
the
tent
within
less
than
six
yards
of
her
mother
miss
sally
confided
to
me
a
scheme
that
made
my
hair
stand
on
end
summarised
it
amounted
to
this
that
first
she
was
in
the
primary
stage
of
a
deal
with
sheehy
for
a
chestnut
colt
for
which
sheehy
was
asking
double
its
value
on
the
assumption
that
it
had
no
rival
in
the
country
that
secondly
they
had
just
heard
it
was
going
to
run
in
the
first
race
and
thirdly
and
lastly
that
as
there
was
no
other
horse
available
flurry
was
going
to
take
old
sultan
out
of
the
and
ride
him
in
the
race
and
that
yeates
had
promised
to
keep
mamma
safe
in
the
tent
while
the
race
was
going
on
and
you
know
major
yeates
it
would
be
delightful
to
beat
sheehy
after
his
getting
the
better
of
you
all
about
the
license
with
this
base
appeal
to
my
professional
feelings
miss
knox
paused
and
looked
at
me
insinuatingly
her
eyes
were
and
very
beguiling
come
on
she
said
they
want
you
to
start
them
pursued
by
visions
of
the
just
wrath
of
lady
knox
i
weakly
followed
miss
sally
to
the
farther
end
of
the
second
field
from
which
point
the
race
was
to
start
the
course
was
not
a
serious
one
two
or
three
natural
banks
a
stone
wall
and
a
couple
of
hurrls
there
were
but
four
riders
including
flurry
who
was
seated
composedly
on
sultan
smoking
a
cigarette
and
talking
confidentially
to
slipper
sultan
although
something
stricken
in
years
and
touched
in
the
wind
was
a
brown
horse
who
in
his
day
had
been
a
hunter
of
no
mean
repute
even
now
he
occasionally
carried
lady
knox
in
a
sedate
and
gentlemanly
manner
but
it
struck
me
that
it
was
trying
him
rather
high
to
take
him
from
the
pole
of
the
after
twelve
miles
on
a
hilly
road
and
hustle
him
over
a
country
against
a
my
acutest
anxiety
however
was
to
start
the
race
as
quickly
as
possible
and
to
get
back
to
the
tent
in
time
to
establish
an
alibi
therefore
i
repressed
my
private
sentiments
and
tying
my
handkerchief
to
a
stick
determined
that
no
time
should
be
fashionably
frittered
away
in
false
starts
they
got
away
somehow
i
believe
sheehy
colt
was
facing
the
wrong
way
at
the
moment
when
i
dropped
the
flag
but
a
friend
turned
him
with
a
stick
and
with
a
cordial
and
timely
whack
speeded
him
on
his
way
on
sufficiently
level
terms
and
then
somehow
instead
of
returning
to
the
tent
i
found
myself
with
miss
sally
on
the
top
of
a
tall
narrow
bank
in
a
precarious
line
of
other
spectators
with
whom
we
toppled
and
swayed
and
in
moments
of
acuter
emotion
held
on
to
each
other
in
unaffected
comradeship
flurry
started
well
and
from
our
commanding
position
we
could
see
him
methodically
riding
at
the
first
fence
at
a
smart
hunting
canter
closely
attended
by
james
canty
brother
on
a
young
black
mare
and
by
an
unknown
youth
on
a
big
white
horse
the
hope
of
sheehy
stable
a
leggy
chestnut
ridden
by
a
cadet
of
the
house
of
sheehy
went
away
from
the
friend
stick
like
a
rocket
and
had
already
refused
the
first
bank
twice
before
old
sultan
decorously
changed
feet
on
it
and
dropped
down
into
the
next
field
with
tranquil
precision
the
white
horse
scrambled
over
it
on
his
stomach
but
landed
safely
despite
the
fact
that
his
rider
clasped
him
round
the
neck
during
the
process
the
black
mare
and
the
chestnut
shouldered
one
another
over
at
the
hole
the
white
horse
had
left
and
the
whole
party
went
away
in
a
bunch
and
jumped
the
ensuing
hurdle
without
disaster
flurry
continued
to
ride
at
the
same
steady
hunting
pace
accompanied
respectfully
by
the
white
horse
and
by
jerry
canty
on
the
black
mare
sheehy
colt
had
clearly
the
legs
of
the
party
and
did
some
showy
galloping
between
the
jumps
but
as
he
refused
to
face
the
banks
without
a
lead
the
end
of
the
first
round
found
the
field
still
a
sociable
party
personally
conducted
by
knox
that
a
dam
nice
horse
said
one
of
my
looking
approvingly
at
sultan
as
he
passed
us
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
round
making
a
good
deal
of
noise
but
apparently
going
at
his
ease
you
might
depind
your
life
on
him
and
he
have
the
crabbedest
jock
in
the
globe
of
ireland
on
him
this
minute
canty
mare
very
sour
said
another
look
at
her
now
baulking
the
bank
she
as
cross
as
a
bag
of
weasels
begob
i
would
say
but
she
a
little
sign
lame
resumed
the
first
she
was
going
light
on
one
leg
on
the
road
a
while
ago
i
tell
you
what
it
is
said
miss
sally
very
seriously
in
my
ear
that
chestnut
of
sheehy
is
settling
down
i
afraid
he
gallop
away
from
sultan
at
the
finish
and
the
wall
wo
stop
him
flurry
ca
get
another
inch
out
of
sultan
he
riding
him
well
she
ended
in
a
critical
voice
which
yet
was
not
quite
like
her
own
perhaps
i
should
not
have
noticed
it
but
for
the
fact
that
the
hand
that
held
my
arm
was
trembling
as
for
me
i
thought
of
lady
knox
and
trembled
too
there
now
remained
but
one
bank
the
trampled
remnant
of
the
furze
hurdle
and
the
stone
wall
the
pace
was
beginning
to
improve
and
the
other
horses
drew
away
from
sultan
they
charged
the
bank
at
full
gallop
the
black
mare
and
the
chestnut
flying
it
perilously
with
a
windmill
flourish
of
legs
and
arms
from
their
riders
the
white
horse
racing
up
to
it
with
a
gallantry
that
deserted
him
at
the
critical
moment
with
the
result
that
his
rider
turned
a
somersault
over
his
head
and
landed
amidst
the
roars
of
the
onlookers
sitting
on
the
fence
facing
his
horse
nose
with
creditable
presence
of
mind
he
remained
on
the
bank
towed
the
horse
over
scrambled
on
to
his
back
again
and
started
afresh
sultan
thirty
yards
to
the
bad
pounded
doggedly
on
and
flurry
cane
and
heels
remained
idle
the
old
horse
obviously
blown
slowed
cautiously
coming
in
at
the
jump
sally
grip
tightened
on
my
arm
and
the
crowd
yelled
as
sultan
answering
to
a
hint
from
the
spurs
and
a
touch
at
his
mouth
heaved
himself
on
to
the
bank
nothing
but
sheer
riding
on
flurry
part
got
him
safe
off
it
and
saved
him
from
the
consequences
of
a
bad
peck
on
landing
none
the
less
he
pulled
himself
together
and
went
away
down
the
hill
for
the
stone
wall
as
stoutly
as
ever
the
skirted
the
last
two
fields
and
there
was
a
gate
in
the
roadside
fence
beside
the
place
where
the
stone
wall
met
it
at
right
angles
i
had
noticed
this
gate
because
during
the
first
round
slipper
had
been
sitting
on
it
demonstrating
with
his
usual
fervour
sheeny
colt
was
leading
with
his
nose
in
the
air
his
rider
hands
going
like
a
circular
saw
and
his
temper
as
a
bystander
remarked
up
on
end
the
black
mare
half
mad
from
spurring
was
going
hard
at
his
heels
completely
out
of
hand
the
white
horse
was
steering
steadily
for
the
wrong
side
of
the
flag
and
flurry
by
dint
of
cutting
corners
and
of
saving
every
yard
of
ground
was
close
enough
to
keep
his
antagonists
heads
over
their
shoulders
while
their
right
arms
rose
and
fell
in
unceasing
flagellation
there
be
a
smash
when
they
come
to
the
wall
if
one
falls
all
go
panted
sally
oh
now
flurry
flurry
what
had
happened
was
that
the
chestnut
colt
had
suddenly
perceived
that
the
gate
at
right
angles
to
the
wall
was
standing
wide
open
and
swinging
away
from
the
jump
he
had
bolted
headlong
out
on
to
the
road
and
along
it
at
top
speed
for
his
home
after
him
fled
canty
black
mare
and
with
her
carried
away
by
the
spirit
of
stampede
went
the
white
horse
flurry
stood
up
in
his
stirrups
and
gave
a
as
he
cantered
down
to
the
wall
sultan
came
at
it
with
the
send
of
the
hill
behind
him
and
jumped
it
with
a
skill
that
intensified
if
that
were
possible
the
volume
of
laughter
and
yells
around
us
by
the
time
the
black
mare
and
the
white
horse
had
returned
and
ignominiously
bundled
over
the
wall
to
finish
as
best
they
might
flurry
was
leading
sultan
towards
us
that
blackguard
slipper
he
said
grinning
every
one
say
i
told
him
to
open
the
gate
but
look
here
i
afraid
we
in
for
trouble
sultan
given
himself
a
bad
you
could
never
drive
him
home
and
i
just
seen
norris
lying
blind
drunk
under
a
wall
now
norris
was
lady
knox
coachman
we
stood
aghast
at
this
horror
on
horror
head
the
blood
trickled
down
sultan
heel
and
the
lather
lay
in
flecks
on
his
dripping
heaving
sides
in
irrefutable
witness
to
the
iniquity
of
lady
knox
only
daughter
then
flurry
said
thank
the
lord
here
the
rain
at
the
moment
i
admit
that
i
failed
to
see
any
cause
for
gratitude
in
this
occurrence
but
later
on
i
appreciated
flurry
grasp
of
circumstances
that
appreciation
was
i
think
at
its
highest
development
about
afterwards
when
i
an
unwilling
conspirator
a
part
with
which
my
acquaintance
with
knox
had
rendered
me
but
too
familiar
unfurled
cadogan
umbrella
over
lady
knox
head
and
hurried
her
through
the
rain
from
the
tent
to
the
keeping
it
and
my
own
person
well
between
her
and
the
horses
i
got
her
in
with
the
rest
of
her
bedraggled
and
exhausted
party
and
slammed
the
door
remember
major
yeates
she
said
through
the
window
you
are
the
person
here
in
whom
i
have
any
confidence
i
do
wish
one
else
to
touch
the
reins
this
with
a
glance
towards
flurry
who
was
standing
near
i
afraid
i
only
a
moderate
whip
i
said
my
dear
man
replied
lady
knox
testily
those
horses
could
drive
themselves
i
slunk
round
to
the
front
of
the
two
horses
carefully
rugged
were
in
it
with
the
inevitable
slipper
at
their
heads
slipper
going
with
you
whispered
flurry
stepping
up
to
me
she
wo
have
me
at
any
price
he
throw
the
rugs
over
them
when
you
get
to
the
house
and
if
you
hold
the
umbrella
well
over
her
never
see
i
manage
to
get
sultan
over
somehow
when
norris
is
sober
that
will
be
all
right
i
climbed
to
the
box
without
answering
my
soul
being
bitter
within
me
as
is
the
soul
of
a
man
who
has
been
persuaded
by
womankind
against
his
judgment
never
again
i
said
to
myself
picking
up
the
reins
let
her
marry
him
or
bernard
shute
or
both
of
them
if
she
likes
but
i
wo
be
roped
into
this
kind
of
business
again
slipper
drew
the
rugs
from
the
horses
revealing
on
the
near
side
lady
knox
majestic
carriage
horse
and
on
the
off
a
brown
mare
of
about
fifteen
hands
what
brute
is
this
said
i
to
slipper
as
he
swarmed
up
beside
me
i
do
rightly
know
where
misther
flurry
got
her
said
slipper
with
one
of
his
hiccoughing
crows
of
laughter
give
her
the
whip
major
and
here
he
broke
into
song
howld
to
the
shteel
honamaundhiaoul
she
run
off
like
an
eel
if
you
do
shut
your
mouth
said
i
with
ferocity
chuck
you
off
the
slipper
was
but
slightly
drunk
and
taking
this
delicate
rebuke
in
good
part
he
relapsed
into
silence
wherever
the
brown
mare
came
from
i
can
certify
that
it
was
not
out
of
double
harness
though
humble
and
anxious
to
oblige
she
pulled
away
from
the
pole
as
if
it
were
red
hot
and
at
critical
moments
had
a
tendency
to
sit
down
however
we
squeezed
without
misadventure
among
the
donkey
carts
and
between
the
groups
of
people
and
bumped
at
length
in
safety
out
on
to
the
here
i
thought
it
no
harm
to
take
slipper
advice
and
i
applied
the
whip
to
the
brown
mare
who
seemed
inclined
to
turn
round
she
immediately
fell
into
an
uncertain
canter
that
no
effort
of
mine
could
frustrate
i
could
only
hope
that
miss
sally
would
foster
conversation
inside
the
and
create
a
distraction
but
judging
from
my
last
view
of
the
party
and
of
lady
knox
in
particular
i
thought
she
was
not
likely
to
be
successful
fortunately
the
rain
was
heavy
and
thick
and
a
rising
west
wind
gave
every
promise
of
its
continuance
i
had
little
doubt
but
that
i
should
catch
cold
but
i
took
it
to
my
bosom
with
gratitude
as
i
reflected
how
it
was
drumming
on
the
roof
of
the
and
blurring
the
windows
we
had
reached
the
foot
of
a
hill
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
racecourse
the
castle
knox
horse
addressed
himself
to
it
with
dignified
determination
but
the
mare
showed
a
sudden
and
alarming
tendency
to
jib
belt
her
major
vociferated
slipper
as
she
hung
back
from
the
pole
chain
with
the
collar
up
her
ewe
neck
and
give
it
to
the
horse
too
he
dhrag
her
i
was
in
the
act
of
belting
when
a
squealing
whinny
struck
upon
my
ear
accompanied
by
a
light
pattering
gallop
on
the
road
behind
us
there
was
an
answering
roar
from
the
brown
mare
a
roar
as
i
realised
with
a
sudden
drop
of
the
heart
of
outraged
maternal
feeling
and
in
another
instant
a
pale
yellow
foal
sprinted
up
beside
us
with
shrill
whickerings
of
joy
had
there
at
this
moment
been
a
boghole
handy
i
should
have
turned
the
into
it
without
hesitation
as
there
was
no
accommodation
of
the
kind
i
laid
the
whip
severely
into
everything
i
could
reach
including
the
foal
the
result
was
that
we
topped
the
hill
at
a
gallop
three
abreast
like
a
russian
troitska
it
was
like
my
usual
luck
that
at
this
identical
moment
we
should
meet
the
police
patrol
who
saluted
respectfully
that
the
divil
may
blisther
michael
moloney
ejaculated
slipper
holding
on
to
the
rail
did
i
give
him
the
foaleen
and
a
halther
on
him
to
keep
him
i
howld
you
a
pint
was
the
wife
let
him
go
for
she
being
vexed
about
the
license
sure
that
one
a
march
foal
he
run
from
here
to
cork
there
was
no
sign
from
my
inside
passengers
and
i
held
on
at
a
round
pace
the
mother
and
child
galloping
absurdly
the
carriage
horse
pulling
hard
but
behaving
like
a
gentleman
i
wildly
revolved
plans
of
how
i
would
make
slipper
turn
the
foal
in
at
the
first
gate
we
came
to
of
what
i
should
say
to
lady
knox
supposing
the
worst
happened
and
the
foal
accompanied
us
to
her
hall
door
and
of
how
i
would
have
flurry
blood
at
the
earliest
possible
opportunity
and
here
the
fateful
sound
of
galloping
behind
us
was
again
heard
it
impossible
i
said
to
myself
she
ca
have
twins
the
galloping
came
nearer
and
slipper
looked
back
murdher
alive
he
said
in
a
stage
whisper
tom
sheehy
afther
us
on
the
butcher
pony
what
that
to
me
i
said
dragging
my
team
aside
to
let
him
pass
i
suppose
he
drunk
like
every
one
else
then
the
voice
of
tom
sheehy
made
itself
heard
shtop
shtop
thief
he
was
bawling
give
up
my
mare
how
will
i
get
me
porther
home
that
was
the
closest
shave
i
have
ever
had
and
nothing
could
have
saved
the
position
but
the
torrential
nature
of
the
rain
and
the
fact
that
lady
knox
had
on
a
new
bonnet
i
explained
to
her
at
the
door
of
the
that
sheehy
was
drunk
which
was
the
one
unassailable
feature
of
the
case
and
had
come
after
his
foal
which
with
the
fatuity
of
its
kind
had
escaped
from
a
field
and
followed
us
i
did
not
mention
to
lady
knox
that
when
sheehy
retreated
apologetically
dragging
the
foal
after
him
in
a
halter
belonging
to
one
of
her
own
carriage
horses
he
had
a
sovereign
of
mine
in
his
pocket
and
during
the
narration
i
avoided
miss
sally
eye
as
carefully
as
she
avoided
mine
the
only
comments
on
the
day
events
that
are
worthy
of
record
were
that
philippa
said
to
me
that
she
had
not
been
able
to
understand
what
the
curious
taste
in
the
tea
had
been
till
sally
told
her
it
was
and
that
cadogan
said
to
philippa
that
night
that
the
major
was
that
dhrinched
that
if
he
had
a
shirt
between
his
skin
and
himself
he
could
have
wrung
it
and
that
lady
knox
said
to
a
mutual
friend
that
though
major
yeates
had
been
extremely
kind
and
obliging
he
was
an
uncommonly
bad
whip
xii
oh
love
oh
fire
it
was
on
one
of
the
hottest
days
of
a
hot
august
that
i
walked
over
to
tory
lodge
to
inform
mr
flurry
knox
that
the
limits
of
human
endurance
had
been
reached
and
that
either
venus
and
her
family
or
i
and
mine
must
quit
shreelane
in
a
moment
of
impulse
i
had
accepted
her
and
her
numerous
progeny
as
guests
in
my
since
when
cadogan
had
given
warning
once
or
twice
a
week
and
maria
lawful
autocrat
of
the
ashpit
had
had
i
quote
the
tin
battles
for
every
male
she
ate
the
walk
over
the
hills
was
not
of
a
nature
to
lower
the
temperature
moral
or
otherwise
the
grassy
path
was
as
slippery
as
glass
the
rocks
radiated
heat
the
bracken
radiated
horseflies
there
was
no
need
to
nurse
my
wrath
to
keep
it
warm
i
found
flurry
seated
in
the
in
a
long
and
unclean
white
linen
coat
engaged
in
clipping
hieroglyphics
on
the
ears
of
a
young
outgoing
draft
an
occupation
in
itself
unfavourable
to
argument
the
young
draft
had
already
monopolised
all
possible
forms
of
remonstrance
from
snarling
in
the
obscurity
behind
the
meal
sack
in
the
to
hysterical
yelling
as
they
were
dragged
forth
by
the
tail
but
through
these
alarms
and
excursions
i
denounced
venus
and
all
her
works
from
slaughtered
wyandottes
to
broken
dishes
even
as
i
did
so
i
was
conscious
of
something
chastened
in
knox
demeanour
some
touch
of
remoteness
and
melancholy
with
which
i
was
quite
unfamiliar
my
indictment
weakened
and
my
grievances
became
trivial
when
laid
before
this
grave
and
almost
religiously
gentle
young
man
i
sorry
you
and
yeates
should
be
vexed
by
her
send
her
back
when
you
like
i
keep
her
maybe
it
not
be
for
so
long
after
all
when
pressed
to
expound
this
dark
saying
flurry
smiled
wanly
and
snipped
a
second
line
in
the
hair
of
the
puppy
that
was
pinned
between
his
legs
i
was
almost
relieved
when
a
hard
try
to
bite
on
the
part
of
the
puppy
imparted
to
flurry
language
a
transient
warmth
but
the
reaction
was
only
temporary
it
be
as
good
for
me
to
make
a
present
of
this
lot
to
old
welby
as
to
take
the
price
he
offering
me
he
went
on
as
he
got
up
and
took
off
his
but
i
could
be
bothered
fighting
him
come
on
in
and
have
something
i
drink
tea
myself
at
this
hour
if
he
had
said
toast
and
water
it
would
have
seemed
no
more
than
was
suitable
to
such
a
frame
of
mind
as
i
followed
him
to
the
house
i
thought
that
when
the
day
came
that
flurry
knox
could
not
be
bothered
with
fighting
old
welby
things
were
becoming
serious
but
i
kept
this
opinion
to
myself
and
merely
offered
an
admiring
comment
on
the
roses
that
were
blooming
on
the
front
of
the
house
i
put
up
every
stick
of
that
trellis
myself
with
my
own
hands
said
flurry
still
gloomily
the
roses
were
trailing
all
over
the
place
for
the
want
of
it
would
you
like
to
have
a
look
at
the
garden
while
they
getting
tea
i
settled
it
up
a
bit
since
you
saw
it
last
i
acceded
to
this
almost
alarmingly
ladylike
suggestion
marvelling
greatly
flurry
certainly
was
a
changed
man
and
his
garden
was
a
changed
garden
it
was
a
very
old
garden
with
unexpected
arbours
madly
overgrown
with
flowering
climbers
and
a
flight
of
grey
steps
leading
to
a
terrace
where
a
sundial
and
ancient
herbaceous
plants
strove
with
nettles
and
briars
but
i
chiefly
remembered
it
as
a
place
where
washing
was
wont
to
hang
on
bushes
and
the
kennel
terrier
matured
his
bones
and
hunted
chickens
there
was
now
rabbit
wire
on
the
gate
the
walks
were
cleaned
the
beds
weeded
there
was
even
a
bed
of
mignonette
a
row
of
sweet
pea
and
a
blazing
party
of
sunflowers
and
michael
once
second
in
command
in
many
a
filibustering
expedition
was
now
on
his
knees
ingloriously
tying
carnations
to
little
pieces
of
cane
we
walked
up
the
steps
to
the
terrace
down
below
us
the
rich
and
southern
blue
of
the
sea
filled
the
gaps
between
scattered
the
hillside
above
was
purple
with
heather
a
bay
mare
and
her
foal
were
moving
lazily
through
the
bracken
with
the
sun
glistening
on
it
and
them
i
looked
back
at
the
house
nestling
in
the
hollow
of
the
hill
i
smelled
the
smell
of
the
mignonette
in
the
air
i
regarded
michael
labouring
back
among
the
carnations
and
without
any
connection
of
ideas
i
seemed
to
see
miss
sally
knox
with
her
hair
and
slight
figure
standing
on
the
terrace
beside
her
kinsman
michael
do
ye
know
where
misther
flurry
squalled
a
voice
from
the
garden
gate
the
untrammelled
voice
of
the
female
domestic
at
large
among
her
fellows
the
tay
wet
and
there
a
man
over
with
a
message
from
aussolas
he
was
tellin
me
the
owld
hairo
beyant
is
givin
out
invitations
a
stricken
silence
fell
induced
no
doubt
by
hasty
danger
signals
from
michael
who
old
hero
beyant
i
asked
as
we
turned
toward
the
house
my
grandmother
said
flurry
permitting
himself
a
smile
that
had
about
as
much
sociability
in
it
as
skim
milk
she
giving
a
dance
at
aussolas
she
gave
one
about
five
years
ago
and
i
declare
you
might
as
well
get
the
influenza
into
the
country
or
a
mission
at
the
chapel
there
wo
be
a
servant
in
the
place
will
be
able
to
answer
their
name
for
a
week
after
it
what
with
toothache
and
headache
and
blathering
in
the
kitchen
we
had
tea
in
the
a
solemnity
which
i
could
not
but
be
aware
was
due
to
the
presence
of
a
new
carpet
a
new
and
a
new
piano
flurry
made
no
comment
on
these
things
but
something
told
me
that
i
was
expected
to
do
so
and
i
did
i
sell
you
the
lot
for
half
what
i
gave
for
them
said
my
host
eyeing
them
with
morose
respect
as
he
poured
out
his
third
cup
of
tea
i
have
all
my
life
been
handicapped
by
not
having
the
courage
of
my
curiosity
those
who
have
the
nerve
to
ask
direct
questions
on
matters
that
do
not
concern
them
seldom
fail
to
extract
direct
answers
but
in
my
lack
of
this
enviable
gift
i
went
home
in
the
dark
as
to
what
had
befallen
my
landlord
and
fully
aware
of
how
my
wife
would
despise
me
for
my
shortcomings
philippa
always
says
that
she
never
asks
questions
but
she
seems
none
the
less
to
get
a
lot
of
answers
on
my
own
avenue
i
met
miss
sally
knox
riding
away
from
the
house
on
her
white
cob
she
had
found
no
one
at
home
and
she
would
not
turn
back
with
me
but
she
did
not
seem
to
be
in
any
hurry
to
ride
away
i
told
her
that
i
had
just
been
over
to
see
her
relative
knox
who
had
informed
me
that
he
meant
to
give
up
the
hounds
a
fact
in
which
she
seemed
only
conventionally
interested
she
looked
pale
and
her
eyelids
were
slightly
pink
i
checked
myself
on
the
verge
of
asking
her
if
she
had
and
inquired
instead
if
she
had
heard
of
the
tenants
dance
at
aussolas
she
did
not
answer
at
first
but
rubbed
her
cane
up
and
down
the
cob
clipped
toothbrush
of
a
mane
then
she
said
major
yeates
look
here
there
a
most
awful
row
at
home
i
expressed
incoherent
regret
and
wished
to
my
heart
that
philippa
had
been
there
to
cope
with
the
situation
it
began
when
mamma
found
out
about
flurry
racing
sultan
and
then
came
our
dance
miss
sally
stopped
i
nodded
remembering
certain
episodes
of
lady
knox
dance
and
mamma
says
she
says
i
waited
respectfully
to
hear
what
mamma
had
said
the
cob
fidgeted
under
the
attentions
of
the
horseflies
and
nearly
trod
on
my
toe
well
the
end
of
it
is
she
said
with
a
gulp
she
said
such
things
to
flurry
that
he
ca
come
near
the
house
again
and
i
to
go
over
to
england
to
aunt
dora
next
week
will
you
tell
philippa
i
came
to
say
to
her
i
do
think
i
can
get
over
here
again
miss
sally
was
a
sufficiently
old
friend
of
mine
for
me
to
take
her
hand
and
press
it
in
a
fatherly
manner
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
unless
i
expressed
my
sympathy
with
her
mother
point
of
view
about
detrimentals
which
was
obviously
not
the
thing
to
do
philippa
accorded
to
my
news
the
rare
tribute
of
speechless
attention
and
then
was
despicable
enough
to
say
that
she
had
foreseen
the
whole
affair
from
the
beginning
from
the
day
that
she
refused
him
in
the
i
suppose
said
i
sarcastically
that
the
beginning
replied
philippa
well
i
went
on
judicially
whenever
it
began
it
was
high
time
for
it
to
end
she
can
do
a
good
deal
better
than
flurry
philippa
became
rather
red
in
the
face
i
call
that
a
thoroughly
commonplace
thing
to
say
she
said
i
dare
say
he
has
not
many
ideas
beyond
horses
but
no
more
has
she
and
he
really
does
come
and
borrow
books
from
me
whitaker
almanack
i
murmured
well
i
do
care
i
like
him
very
much
and
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
and
you
wrong
and
i
tell
you
why
here
cadogan
came
into
the
room
her
cap
at
rather
more
than
its
usual
warlike
angle
over
her
scarlet
forehead
and
in
her
hand
a
kitchen
plate
on
which
a
note
was
ceremoniously
laid
forth
but
this
is
for
you
cadogan
said
philippa
as
she
looked
at
it
returned
cadogan
with
immense
dignity
i
have
no
learning
and
from
what
the
young
man
afther
telling
me
that
brought
it
from
aussolas
i
sooner
yerself
read
it
for
me
than
thim
gerrls
my
wife
opened
the
envelope
and
drew
forth
a
sheet
of
pink
paper
miss
margaret
nolan
presents
her
compliments
to
cadogan
she
read
and
i
have
the
pleasure
of
telling
you
that

servants
of
aussolas
is
inviting
you
and
peter

to
go

remarked

philippa
quelling
me
with
a
glance
i
suppose
you

said
cadogan
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
a
level
with
the
i
thank
god
i
a
widow
and
the
only
i
do
is
to
dance
to
my
grave
well
perhaps
julia
and
annie
and
peter
suggested
philippa
considerably
overawed
i
not
one
of
them
that
holds
with
loud
mockery
and
harangues
continued
cadogan
but
if
i
had
any
wish
for
dhrawing
down
talk
i
could
tell
you
that
the
like
o
them
has
their
share
of
dances
without
going
to
aussolas
was
it
only
last
sunday
week
i
wint
follyin
the
turkey
that
layin
out
in
the
plantation
and
the
whole
o
thim
hysted
their
sails
and
back
with
them
to
their
lovers
at
the
and
the
having
a
to
be
playing
for
them
that
was
very
wrong
said
the
truckling
philippa
i
hope
you
spoke
to
the
about
it
is
it
spake
to
thim
rejoined
cadogan
no
but
what
i
done
was
to
dhrag
the
kitchenmaid
round
the
passages
by
the
hair
o
the
head
well
after
that
i
think
you
might
let
her
go
to
aussolas
said
i
venturously
the
end
of
it
was
that
every
one
in
and
about
the
house
went
to
aussolas
on
the
following
wednesday
including
cadogan
philippa
had
gone
over
to
stay
at
the
shutes
ostensibly
to
arrange
about
a
jumble
sale
the
real
object
being
as
a
matter
of
history
to
inspect
the
scotch
young
lady
before
whom
bernard
shute
had
dumped
his
affections
in
his
customary
manner
being
alone
with
every
prospect
of
a
bad
dinner
i
accepted
with
gratitude
an
invitation
to
dine
and
sleep
at
aussolas
and
see
the
dance
it
is
only
on
very
special
occasions
that
i
have
the
heart
to
remind
philippa
that
she
had
neither
part
nor
lot
in
what
occurred
it
is
too
serious
a
matter
for
trivial
gloryings
knox
had
asked
me
to
dine
at
six
which
meant
that
i
arrived
in
blazing
sunlight
and
evening
clothes
punctually
at
that
hour
and
that
at
seven
i
was
still
sitting
in
the
library
reading
classics
while
my
hostess
held
loud
conversations
down
staircases
with
denis
the
robinson
crusoe
who
combined
in
himself
the
offices
of
coachman
butler
and
to
the
best
of
my
belief
valet
to
the
lady
of
the
house
the
door
opened
at
last
and
denis
looking
as
furtive
as
his
prototype
after
he
had
sighted
the
footprint
put
in
his
head
and
beckoned
to
me
the
misthress
says
will
ye
go
to
dinner
without
her
he
said
very
confidentially
sure
she
greatly
vexed
ye
should
be
waitin
on
her
was
the
kitchen
chimney
cot
fire
and
faith
she
afther
giving
biddy
mahony
the
sack
on
the
head
of
it
though
indeed
is
little
regard
a
chimney
on
fire
here
any
other
day
knox
woolly
dog
was
the
sole
occupant
of
the
when
i
entered
it
he
was
sitting
on
his
mistress
chair
with
all
the
air
of
outrage
peculiar
to
a
small
and
dog
when
routine
has
been
interfered
with
it
was
difficult
to
discover
what
had
caused
the
delay
the
meal
not
excepting
the
soup
being
a
cold
collation
it
was
heavily
flavoured
with
soot
and
was
hurled
on
to
the
table
by
crusoe
in
spasmodic
bursts
contemporaneous
no
doubt
with
biddy
fits
of
hysterics
in
the
kitchen
its
most
memorable
feature
was
a
noble
lake
trout
which
appeared
in
two
jagged
pieces
a
matter
lightly
alluded
to
by
denis
as
the
result
of
a
little
argument
between
himself
and
biddy
as
to
the
dish
on
which
it
was
to
be
served
further
conversation
elicited
the
interesting
fact
that
the
combatants
had
pulled
the
trout
in
two
before
the
matter
was
settled
a
brief
glance
at
my
attendant
hands
decided
me
to
let
the
woolly
dog
justify
his
existence
by
consuming
my
portion
for
me
when
crusoe
left
the
room
old
knox
remained
invisible
till
the
end
of
dinner
when
she
appeared
in
the
purple
velvet
bonnet
that
she
was
reputed
to
have
worn
since
the
famine
and
a
woollen
shawl
fastened
by
a
splendid
diamond
brooch
that
flashed
rainbow
fire
against
the
last
shafts
of
sunset
there
was
a
fire
in
the
old
lady
eye
too
the
light
that
i
had
sometimes
seen
in
flurry
in
moments
of
crisis
i
have
no
apologies
to
offer
that
are
worth
hearing
she
said
but
i
have
come
to
drink
a
glass
of
port
wine
with
you
if
you
will
so
far
honour
me
and
then
we
must
go
out
and
see
the
ball
my
grandson
is
late
as
usual
she
crumbled
a
biscuit
with
a
brown
and
preoccupied
hand
her
fingers
carried
a
crowded
sparkle
of
diamonds
upwards
as
she
raised
her
glass
to
her
lips
the
twilight
was
falling
when
we
left
the
room
and
made
our
way
downstairs
i
followed
the
little
figure
in
the
purple
bonnet
through
dark
regions
of
passages
and
doorways
where
strange
lumber
lay
about
there
was
a
rusty
suit
of
armour
an
upturned
punt
mouldering
pictures
and
finally
by
a
door
that
opened
into
the
yard
a
bicycle
white
with
the
dust
of
travel
i
supposed
this
latter
to
have
been
imported
from
dublin
by
the
fashionable
miss
maggie
nolan
but
on
the
other
hand
it
was
well
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
it
belonged
to
old
knox
the
at
aussolas
was
on
a
par
with
the
rest
of
the
establishment
being
vast
dilapidated
and
of
unknown
age
its
three
double
doors
were
wide
open
and
the
guests
overflowed
through
them
into
the
yard
above
their
heads
the
tin
reflectors
of
paraffin
lamps
glared
at
us
from
among
the
christmas
decorations
of
holly
and
ivy
that
festooned
the
walls
the
voices
of
a
fiddle
and
a
concertina
combined
were
uttering
a
polka
with
shrill
and
hideous
fluency
to
which
the
scraping
and
stamping
of
hobnailed
boots
made
a
ponderous
bass
accompaniment
knox
had
been
placed
in
a
commanding
position
at
the
top
of
the
room
and
she
made
her
way
slowly
to
it
shaking
hands
with
all
varieties
of
tenants
and
saying
right
things
without
showing
any
symptom
of
that
flustered
boredom
that
i
have
myself
exhibited
when
i
went
round
the
men
messes
on
christmas
day
she
took
her
seat
in
the
with
the
white
dog
in
her
lap
and
looked
with
her
hawk
eyes
round
the
array
of
faces
that
hemmed
in
the
space
where
the
dancers
were
solemnly
bobbing
and
hopping
will
you
tell
me
who
that
tomfool
is
denis
she
said
pointing
to
a
young
lady
in
a
ball
dress
who
was
circling
in
conscious
magnificence
and
somewhat
painful
incongruity
in
the
arms
of
peter
cadogan
that
the
from
castle
knox
yer
honour
replied
denis
with
something
remarkably
like
a
wink
at
knox
when
did
the
castle
knox
servants
come
asked
the
old
lady
very
sharply
the
same
time
yer
honour
left
the
table
and
pillilew
this
there
was
a
clatter
of
galloping
hoofs
in
the
courtyard
as
of
a
troop
of
cavalry
and
out
of
the
heart
of
it
flurry
voice
shouting
to
denis
to
drive
out
the
colts
and
shut
the
gates
before
they
had
the
people
killed
i
noticed
that
the
colour
had
risen
to
knox
face
and
i
put
it
down
to
anxiety
about
her
young
horses
i
may
admit
that
when
i
heard
flurry
voice
and
saw
him
collaring
his
grandmother
guests
and
pushing
them
out
of
the
way
as
he
came
into
the
i
rather
feared
that
he
was
in
the
condition
so
often
defined
to
me
at
petty
sessions
as
not
dhrunk
but
having
dhrink
taken
his
face
was
white
his
eyes
glittered
there
was
a
general
air
of
exaltation
about
him
that
suggested
the
solace
of
the
pangs
of
love
according
to
the
most
ancient
convention
hullo
he
said
swaggering
up
to
the
orchestra
what
this
humbugging
thing
they
playing
a
polka
is
it
drop
that
john
casey
and
play
a
jig
john
casey
ceased
abjectly
what
i
play
masther
flurry
what
the
devil
do
i
care
here
yeates
put
a
name
on
it
you
a
sort
of
musicianer
yourself
i
know
the
names
of
three
or
four
irish
jigs
but
on
this
occasion
my
memory
clung
exclusively
to
one
i
suppose
because
it
was
the
one
i
felt
to
be
peculiarly
inappropriate
oh
well
to
the
wedding
i
said
looking
away
flurry
gave
a
shout
of
laughter
that
it
he
exclaimed
play
it
up
john
give
us
to
the
wedding
that
major
yeates
fancy
decidedly
flurry
was
drunk
what
wrong
with
you
all
that
you
are
dancing
he
continued
striding
up
the
middle
of
the
room
maybe
you
do
know
how
here
i
soon
get
one
that
show
you
he
advanced
upon
his
grandmother
snatched
her
out
of
the
and
amid
roars
of
applause
led
her
out
while
the
fiddle
squealed
its
way
through
the
inimitable
twists
of
the
tune
and
the
concertina
surged
and
panted
after
it
whatever
knox
may
have
thought
of
her
grandson
behaviour
she
was
evidently
going
to
make
the
best
of
it
she
took
her
station
opposite
to
him
in
the
purple
bonnet
the
shawl
and
the
diamonds
she
picked
up
her
skirt
at
each
side
affording
a
view
of
narrow
feet
in
cloth
boots
and
for
three
repeats
of
the
tune
she
stood
up
to
her
grandson
and
footed
it
on
the
floor
what
the
cloth
boots
did
i
could
not
exactly
follow
they
were
as
well
as
i
could
see
extremely
scientific
while
there
was
hardly
so
much
as
a
nod
from
the
plumes
of
the
bonnet
flurry
was
also
scientific
but
his
dancing
did
not
alter
my
opinion
that
he
was
drunk
in
fact
i
thought
he
was
making
rather
an
exhibition
of
himself
they
say
that
that
jig
was
twenty
pounds
in
knox
pocket
at
the
next
rent
day
but
though
this
statement
is
open
to
doubt
i
believe
that
if
she
and
flurry
had
taken
the
hat
round
there
and
then
she
would
have
got
in
the
best
part
of
her
arrears
after
this
the
company
settled
down
to
business
the
dances
lasted
a
sweltering
old
women
and
young
dancing
with
equal
and
tireless
zest
at
the
end
of
each
the
gentlemen
abandoned
their
partners
without
ceremony
or
comment
and
went
out
to
smoke
while
the
ladies
retired
to
the
laundry
where
families
of
teapots
stewed
on
the
long
bars
of
the
fire
and
mahony
cut
up
mighty
and
the
was
illimitable
at
ten
knox
withdrew
from
the
revel
she
said
that
she
was
tired
but
i
have
seldom
seen
any
one
look
more
wide
awake
i
thought
that
i
might
unobtrusively
follow
her
example
but
i
was
intercepted
by
flurry
yeates
he
said
seriously
i
take
it
as
a
kindness
if
you
see
this
thing
out
with
me
we
must
keep
them
pretty
sober
and
get
them
out
of
this
by
daylight
i
i
have
to
get
home
early
i
at
once
took
back
my
opinion
that
flurry
was
drunk
i
almost
wished
he
had
been
as
i
could
then
have
deserted
him
without
a
pang
as
it
was
i
addressed
myself
heavily
to
the
night
enjoyment
wan
with
heat
but
conscientiously
cheerful
i
danced
with
miss
maggie
nolan
with
the
castle
knox
with
my
own
kitchenmaid
who
fell
into
wild
giggles
of
terror
whenever
i
spoke
to
her
with
cadogan
who
had
apparently
postponed
the
interesting
feat
of
dancing
to
her
grave
and
did
what
she
could
to
dance
me
into
mine
i
am
bound
to
admit
that
though
an
and
a
major
and
therefore
equipped
with
a
character
for
gallantry
cadogan
was
the
only
one
of
my
partners
with
whom
i
conversed
with
any
comfort
at
intervals
i
smoked
cigarettes
in
the
yard
seated
on
the
old
by
the
gate
and
overheard
such
conversation
about
the
price
of
pigs
in
skebawn
at
intervals
i
plunged
again
into
the
and
led
forth
a
perspiring
wallflower
into
the
scrimmage
of
a
polka
or
shuffled
meaninglessly
opposite
to
her
in
the
long
double
line
of
dancers
who
were
engaged
with
serious
faces
in
executing
a
jig
or
a
reel
i
neither
knew
nor
cared
which
flurry
remained
as
undefeated
as
ever
i
could
only
suppose
it
was
his
method
of
showing
that
his
broken
heart
had
mended
it
time
to
be
making
the
punch
masther
flurry
said
denis
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
sure
the
night
warm
and
the
all
gaping
for
it
the
craytures
what
we
make
it
in
said
flurry
as
we
followed
him
into
the
laundry
the
boiler
to
be
sure
said
crusoe
taking
up
a
stone
of
sugar
and
preparing
to
shoot
it
into
the
laundry
copper
stop
you
fool
it
full
of
cockroaches
shouted
flurry
amid
sympathetic
squalls
from
the
throng
of
countrywomen
go
get
a
bath
sure
yerself
knows
there
but
one
bath
in
it
retorted
denis
and
that
within
in
the
major
room
faith
the
tinker
got
his
own
share
yestherday
with
the
same
bath
sthriving
to
quinch
the
holes
and
they
as
thick
in
it
as
the
stars
in
the
sky
and
is
weeping
still
afther
all
he
done
well
then
here
goes
for
the
cockroaches
said
flurry
what
does
sicken
will
fatten
give
me
the
kettle
and
come
on
you
kitty
collins
and
be
skimming
them
off
there
were
no
complaints
of
the
punch
when
the
brew
was
completed
and
the
dance
thundered
on
with
a
heavier
stamping
and
a
louder
hilarity
than
before
the
night
wore
on
i
squeezed
through
the
unyielding
pack
of
frieze
coats
and
shawls
in
the
doorway
and
with
feet
that
momently
swelled
in
my
pumps
i
limped
over
the
to
smoke
my
eighth
cigarette
on
the
it
was
a
dark
hot
night
the
old
castle
loomed
above
me
in
roofs
and
gables
and
high
up
in
it
somewhere
a
window
sent
a
shaft
of
light
into
the
sleeping
leaves
of
a
that
overhung
the
gateway
at
the
bars
of
the
gate
two
young
horses
peered
in
at
the
medley
of
noise
and
people
away
in
an
outhouse
a
cock
crew
hoarsely
the
gaiety
in
the
increased
momently
till
amid
shrieks
and
bursts
of
laughter
miss
maggie
nolan
fed
coquettishly
from
it
with
a
long
yell
like
a
train
coming
out
of
a
tunnel
pursued
by
the
fascinating
peter
cadogan
brandishing
a
twig
of
mountain
ash
in
imitation
of
mistletoe
the
young
horses
stampeded
in
horror
and
immediately
a
voice
proceeded
from
the
lighted
window
above
knox
voice
demanding
what
the
noise
was
and
announcing
that
if
she
heard
any
more
of
it
she
would
have
the
place
cleared
an
awful
silence
fell
to
which
the
young
horses
fleeing
hoofs
lent
the
final
touch
of
consternation
then
i
heard
the
irrepressible
maggie
nolan
say
oh
god
which
i
take
to
be
a
reflection
on
the
mutability
of
all
earthly
happiness
knox
remained
for
a
moment
at
the
window
and
it
struck
me
as
remarkable
that
at
she
should
still
have
on
her
bonnet
i
thought
i
heard
her
speak
to
some
one
in
the
room
and
there
followed
a
laugh
a
laugh
that
was
not
a
servant
and
was
puzzlingly
familiar
i
gave
it
up
and
presently
dropped
into
a
cheerless
doze
with
the
dawn
there
came
a
period
when
even
flurry
showed
signs
of
failing
he
came
and
sat
down
beside
me
with
a
yawn
it
struck
me
that
there
was
more
impatience
and
nervousness
than
fatigue
in
the
yawn
i
think
i
turn
them
all
out
of
this
after
the
next
dance
is
over
he
said
i
a
lot
to
do
and
i
ca
stay
here
i
grunted
in
drowsy
approval
it
must
have
been
a
few
minutes
later
that
i
felt
flurry
grip
my
shoulder
yeates
he
said
look
up
at
the
roof
do
you
see
anything
up
there
by
the
kitchen
chimney
he
was
pointing
at
a
heavy
stack
of
chimneys
in
a
tower
that
stood
up
against
the
grey
and
pink
of
the
morning
sky
at
the
angle
where
one
of
them
joined
the
roof
smoke
was
oozing
busily
out
and
as
i
stared
a
little
wisp
of
flame
stole
through
the
next
thing
that
i
distinctly
remember
is
being
in
the
van
of
a
rush
through
the
kitchen
passages
every
one
shouting
water
water
and
not
knowing
where
to
find
it
then
up
several
flights
of
the
narrowest
and
darkest
stairs
it
has
ever
been
my
fate
to
ascend
with
a
bucket
of
water
that
i
snatched
from
a
woman
spilling
as
i
ran
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
came
a
ladder
leading
to
a
and
up
in
the
dark
loft
above
was
the
roar
and
the
wavering
glare
of
flames
my
god
that
sthrong
fire
shouted
denis
tumbling
down
the
ladder
with
a
brace
of
empty
buckets
we
never
save
it
the
lake
quinch
it
the
flames
were
squirting
out
through
the
bricks
of
the
chimney
through
the
timbers
through
the
slates
it
was
barely
possible
to
get
through
the
and
the
booming
and
crackling
strengthened
every
instant
a
chain
to
the
lake
gasped
flurry
coughing
in
the
stifling
heat
as
he
slashed
the
water
at
the
blazing
rafters
the
well
no
good
go
on
yeates
the
organising
of
a
double
chain
out
of
the
mob
that
thronged
and
shouted
and
jammed
in
the
passages
and
yard
was
no
mean
feat
of
generalship
but
it
got
done
somehow
cadogan
and
biddy
mahony
rose
magnificently
to
the
occasion
cursing
thumping
shoving
and
stable
buckets
coal
buckets
milk
pails
and
kettles
were
unearthed
and
sent
swinging
down
the
grass
slope
to
the
lake
that
lay
in
glittering
unconcern
in
the
morning
sunshine
men
women
and
children
worked
in
a
way
that
only
irish
people
can
work
on
an
emergency
all
their
cleverness
all
their
and
all
their
love
of
a
ruction
came
to
the
front
the
screaming
and
the
exhortations
were
incessant
but
so
were
also
the
buckets
that
flew
from
hand
to
hand
up
to
the
loft
i
hardly
know
how
long
we
were
at
it
but
there
came
a
time
when
i
looked
up
from
the
yard
and
saw
that
the
billows
of
reddened
smoke
from
the
top
of
the
tower
were
dying
down
and
i
bethought
me
of
old
knox
i
found
her
at
the
door
of
her
room
engaged
in
tying
up
a
bundle
of
old
clothes
in
a
sheet
she
looked
as
white
as
a
corpse
but
she
was
not
in
any
way
quelled
by
the
situation
i
be
obliged
to
you
all
the
same
major
yeates
to
throw
this
over
the
balusters
she
said
as
i
advanced
with
the
news
that
the
fire
had
been
got
under
my
honour
i
do
know
when
i
been
as
vexed
as
i
been
this
night
what
with
one
thing
and
another
is
a
monstrous
thing
to
use
a
guest
as
we
used
you
but
what
could
we
do
i
threw
all
the
silver
out
of
the
window
myself
and
the
poor
peahen
that
had
her
nest
there
was
hurt
by
an
entrée
dish
and
half
her
eggs
were
there
was
a
curious
sound
not
unlike
a
titter
in
knox
room
however
we
ca
make
omelettes
without
breaking
eggs
as
they
say
she
went
on
rather
hurriedly
i
declare
i
do
know
what
i
saying
my
old
head
is
confused
here
knox
went
abruptly
into
her
room
and
shut
the
door
obviously
there
was
nothing
further
to
do
for
my
hostess
and
i
fought
my
way
up
the
dripping
back
staircase
to
the
loft
the
flames
had
ceased
the
supply
of
buckets
had
been
stopped
and
flurry
standing
on
a
ponderous
crossbeam
was
poking
his
head
and
shoulders
out
into
the
sunlight
through
the
hole
that
had
been
burned
in
the
roof
denis
and
others
were
pouring
water
over
charred
beams
the
atmosphere
was
still
stifling
everything
was
black
everything
dripped
with
inky
water
flurry
descended
from
his
beam
and
stretched
himself
looking
like
a
drowned
we
made
a
night
of
it
yeates
have
we
he
said
but
bested
it
anyhow
we
were
done
for
only
for
you
there
was
more
emotion
about
him
than
the
occasion
seemed
to
warrant
and
his
eyes
had
a
christy
minstrel
brightness
not
wholly
to
be
attributed
to
the
dirt
on
his
face
what
the
time
i
must
get
home
the
time
incredible
as
it
seemed
was
six
i
could
almost
have
sworn
that
flurry
changed
colour
when
i
said
so
i
must
be
off
he
said
i
had
no
idea
it
was
so
late
why
what
the
hurry
i
asked
he
stared
at
me
laughed
foolishly
and
fell
to
giving
directions
to
denis
five
minutes
afterwards
he
drove
out
of
the
yard
and
away
at
a
canter
down
the
long
stretch
of
avenue
that
skirted
the
lake
with
a
troop
of
young
horses
flying
on
either
hand
he
whirled
his
whip
round
his
head
and
shouted
at
them
and
was
lost
to
sight
in
a
clump
of
trees
it
is
a
vision
of
him
that
remains
with
me
and
it
always
carried
with
it
the
bitter
smell
of
wet
charred
wood
reaction
had
begun
to
set
in
among
the
volunteers
the
chain
took
to
sitting
in
the
kitchen
cups
of
tea
began
mysteriously
to
circulate
and
personal
narratives
of
the
fire
were
already
foreshadowing
the
amazing
legends
that
have
since
gathered
round
the
night
adventure
i
left
to
denis
the
task
of
clearing
the
house
and
went
up
to
change
my
wet
clothes
with
a
feeling
that
i
had
not
been
to
bed
for
a
year
the
ghost
of
a
waiter
who
had
drowned
himself
in
a
boghole
would
have
presented
a
cheerier
aspect
than
i
as
i
surveyed
myself
in
the
prehistoric
mirror
in
my
room
with
the
sunshine
falling
on
my
unshorn
face
and
begrimed
i
made
my
toilet
at
considerable
length
and
it
being
now
nearly
eight
went
downstairs
to
look
for
something
to
eat
i
had
left
the
house
humming
with
people
i
found
it
silent
as
pompeii
the
sheeted
bundles
containing
knox
wardrobe
were
lying
about
the
hall
a
couple
of
ancestors
who
in
the
first
alarm
had
been
dragged
from
the
walls
were
leaning
drunkenly
against
the
bundles
last
night
dessert
was
still
on
the
table
i
went
out
on
to
the
steps
and
saw
the
in
a
glittering
heap
in
a
nasturtium
bed
and
realised
that
there
was
no
breakfast
for
me
this
side
of
lunch
at
shreelane
there
was
a
sound
of
wheels
on
the
avenue
and
a
brougham
came
into
view
driving
fast
up
the
long
open
stretch
by
the
lake
it
was
the
castle
knox
brougham
driven
by
norris
whom
i
had
last
seen
drunk
at
the
athletic
sports
and
as
it
drew
up
at
the
door
i
saw
lady
knox
inside
it
all
right
the
fire
out
i
said
advancing
genially
and
full
of
reassurance
what
fire
said
lady
knox
regarding
me
with
an
iron
countenance
i
explained
well
as
the
house
is
burned
down
said
lady
knox
cutting
short
my
details
perhaps
you
would
kindly
find
out
if
i
could
see
mrs
knox
lady
knox
face
was
many
shades
redder
than
usual
i
began
to
understand
that
something
awful
had
happened
or
would
happen
and
i
wished
myself
safe
at
shreelane
with
the
bedclothes
over
my
head
if
is
for
the
misthress
you
looking
me
lady
said
denis
voice
behind
me
in
tones
of
the
utmost
respect
she
went
out
to
the
kitchen
garden
a
while
ago
to
get
a
blasht
o
the
fresh
air
afther
the
night
maybe
your
ladyship
would
sit
inside
in
the
library
till
i
call
her
lady
knox
eyed
crusoe
suspiciously
thank
you
i
fetch
her
myself
she
said
oh
sure
that
too
throuble
began
denis
stay
where
you
are
said
lady
knox
in
a
voice
like
the
slam
of
a
door
bedad
i
best
plased
she
went
whispered
denis
as
lady
knox
set
forth
alone
down
the
shrubbery
walk
but
is
knox
in
the
garden
said
i
the
lord
preserve
your
innocence
sir
replied
denis
with
seeming
irrelevance
at
this
moment
i
became
aware
of
the
incredible
fact
that
sally
knox
was
silently
descending
the
stairs
she
stopped
short
as
she
got
into
the
hall
and
looked
almost
wildly
at
me
and
denis
was
i
looking
at
her
wraith
there
was
again
a
sound
of
wheels
on
the
gravel
she
went
to
the
hall
door
outside
which
was
now
drawn
up
as
well
as
lady
knox
brougham
and
as
if
overcome
by
this
imposing
spectacle
she
turned
back
and
put
her
hands
over
her
face
she
gone
round
to
the
garden
asthore
said
denis
in
a
hoarse
whisper
go
in
the
be
all
right
he
seized
her
by
the
arm
pushed
her
down
the
steps
and
into
the
little
carriage
pulled
up
the
hood
over
her
to
its
furthest
stretch
snatched
the
whip
out
of
the
hand
of
the
norris
and
with
terrific
objurgations
lashed
the
donkey
into
a
gallop
the
grasped
the
position
whatever
it
might
be
he
took
up
the
running
on
the
other
side
and
the
swung
away
down
the
avenue
with
all
its
incongruous
air
of
hooded
and
rowdy
invalidism
i
have
never
disguised
the
fact
that
i
am
a
coward
and
therefore
when
at
this
dynamitical
moment
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
lady
knox
hat
over
a
laurustinus
as
she
returned
at
high
speed
from
the
garden
i
slunk
into
the
house
and
faded
away
round
the
door
this
minute
i
seen
the
misthress
going
down
through
the
plantation
beyond
said
the
voice
of
crusoe
outside
the
window
and
i
afther
sending
johnny
regan
to
her
with
the
little
carriage
not
to
put
any
more
delay
on
yer
ladyship
sure
you
can
see
him
making
all
the
haste
he
can
maybe
you
sit
inside
in
the
library
till
she
comes
silence
followed
i
peered
cautiously
round
the
window
curtain
lady
knox
was
looking
defiantly
at
the
as
it
reeled
at
top
speed
into
the
shades
of
the
plantation
strenuously
pursued
by
the
woolly
dog
norris
was
regarding
his
horses
ears
in
expressionless
respectability
denis
was
picking
up
the
with
decorous
solicitude
lady
knox
turned
and
came
into
the
house
she
passed
the
door
with
an
ominous
step
and
went
on
into
the
library
it
seemed
to
me
that
now
or
never
was
the
moment
to
retire
quietly
to
my
room
put
my
things
into
my
portmanteau
and
denis
rushed
into
the
room
with
the
piled
up
to
his
chin
she
diddled
he
whispered
crashing
them
down
on
the
table
he
came
at
me
with
his
hand
out
three
cheers
for
masther
flurry
and
miss
sally
he
hissed
wringing
my
hand
up
and
down
and
was
yerself
called
for
to
the
weddin
last
night
long
life
to
ye
the
lord
save
us
there
the
misthress
going
into
the
library
through
the
door
i
saw
old
knox
approach
the
library
from
the
staircase
with
a
dignified
slowness
she
had
on
a
wedding
garment
a
long
white
burnous
in
which
she
might
easily
have
been
mistaken
for
a
small
stout
clergyman
she
waved
back
crusoe
the
door
closed
upon
her
and
the
battle
of
giants
was
entered
upon
i
sat
down
it
was
all
i
was
able
for
and
remained
for
a
full
minute
in
stupefied
contemplation
of
the
perhaps
of
all
conclusions
to
a
situation
so
portentous
that
which
occurred
was
the
least
possible
twenty
minutes
after
knox
met
her
antagonist
i
was
summoned
from
strapping
my
portmanteau
to
face
the
appalling
duty
of
escorting
the
combatants
in
lady
knox
brougham
to
the
church
outside
the
back
gate
to
which
miss
sally
had
preceded
them
in
the
i
pulled
myself
together
went
down
stairs
and
found
that
the
millennium
had
suddenly
set
in
it
had
apparently
dawned
with
the
news
that
aussolas
and
all
things
therein
were
bequeathed
to
flurry
by
his
grandmother
and
had
established
itself
finally
upon
the
considerations
that
the
marriage
was
past
praying
for
and
that
the
diamonds
were
intended
for
miss
sally
we
fetched
the
bride
and
bridegroom
from
the
church
we
fetched
old
eustace
hamilton
who
married
them
we
dug
out
the
champagne
from
the
cellar
we
even
found
rice
and
threw
it
the
hired
carriage
that
had
been
ordered
to
take
the
runaways
across
country

a
distant
station
was
driven
by
slipper
he
was
shaved
he
wore
an
old
livery
coat
and
a
new
pot
hat
he
was
wondrous
sober
on
the
following
morning
he
was
found
asleep
on
a
heap
of
stones
ten
miles
away
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
one
of
the
horses
was
grazing
in
a
field
with
a
certain
amount
of
harness
hanging
about
it
the
carriage
and
the
remaining
horse
were
discovered
in

roadside
ditch
two
miles
farther
on

of
the

been
torn
off
and
in

interior
