was
given
scant
time
after
the
last
gun
of
the
war
was
fired
to
realize
the
blessings
of
peace
while
others
hastened
to
discard
the

and
don

the
dress
of
civilians
hurrying
to
the
cars
and
groaning
over
the
slowness
of
the
trains
that
bore
them
to
their
homes
my
husband
was
almost
breathlessly
preparing
for
a
long
journey
to
texas
he
did
not
even
see
the
last
of
that
grand
review
of
the
and
of
may
on
the
first
day
he
was
permitted
to
doff
his
hat
and
bow
low
as
he
proudly
led
that
superb
body
of
men
the
third
division
of
cavalry
in
front
of
the
grand
stand
where
sat
the
powers
that
be
along
the
line
of
the
division
each
soldier
straightened
himself
in
the
saddle
and
felt
the
proud
blood
fill
his
veins
as
he
realized
that
he
was
one
of
those
who
in
six
months
had
taken
of
the
enemy
guns
and
upward
of
prisoners
of
war
while
they
had
never
lost
a
flag
or
failed
to
capture
a
gun
for
which
they
fought
in
the
afternoon
of
that
memorable
day
general
custer
and
his
staff
rode
to
the
outskirts
of
washington
where
his
beloved
third
cavalry
division
had
encamped
after
returning
from
taking
part
in
the
review
the
trumpet
was
sounded
and
the
call
brought
these
veterans
out
once
more
not
for
a
charge
not
for
duty
but
to
say
that
word
which
we
who
have
been
compelled
to
live
in
its
mournful
sound
so
many
years
dread
even
to
write
down
the
line
rode
their
boy
general
waving
his
hat
but
setting
his
teeth
and
trying
to
hold
with
iron
nerve
the
quivering
muscles
of
his
speaking
face
keeping
his
eyes
wide
open
that
the
moisture
dimming
their
vision
might
not
gather
and
fall
cheer
after
cheer
rose
on
that
soft
spring
air
some
enthusiastic
voice
started
up
afresh
before
the
hurrahs
were
done
a
tiger
for
old
curley
off
came
the
hats
again
and
up
went
hundreds
of
arms
waving
the
and
wafting
innumerable
blessings
after
the
man
who
was
sending
them
home
in
a
blaze
of
glory
with
a
record
of
which
they
might
boast
around
their
firesides
i
began
to
realize
as
i
watched
this
sad
parting
the
truth
of
what
the
general
had
been
telling
me
he
held
that
no
friendship
was
like
that
cemented
by
mutual
danger
on
the
the
soldiers
accustomed
to
suppression
through
strict
military
discipline
now
vehemently
expressed
their
feelings
and
though
it
gladdened
the
general
heart
it
was
still
the
hardest
sort
of
work
to
endure
it
all
without
show
of
emotion
as
he
rode
up
to
where
i
was
waiting
he
could
not
dared
not
trust
himself
to
speak
to
me
to
those
intrepid
men
he
was
indebted
for
his
success
their
unfailing
trust
in
his
judgment
their
willingness
to
follow
where
he
led
ah
he
knew
well
that
one
looks
upon
such
men
but
once
in
a
lifetime
some
of
the
soldiers
called
out
for
the
general
wife
the
staff
urged
me
to
ride
forward
to
the
troops
as
it
was
but
a
little
thing
thus
to
respond
to
their
i
tried
to
do
so
but
after
a
few
steps
i
begged
those
beside
whom
i
rode
to
take
me
back
to
where
we
had
been
standing
i
was
too
overcome
from
having
seen
the
suffering
on
my
husband
face
to
endure
any
more
sorrow
illustration
texas
in
and
in
as
the
officers
gathered
about
the
general
and
wrung
his
hand
in
parting
to
my
surprise
the
soldiers
gave
me
a
cheer
though
very
grateful
for
the
tribute
to
me
as
their
acknowledged
comrade
i
did
not
feel
that
i
deserved
it
hardships
such
as
they
had
suffered
for
a
principle
require
a
far
higher
order
of
character
than
the
same
hardships
endured
when
the
motive
is
devotion
individualized
once
more
the
general
leaped
into
the
saddle
and
we
rode
rapidly
out
of
sight
how
glad
i
was
as
i
watched
the
set
features
of
my
face
saw
his
eyes
fixed
immovably
in
front
of
him
listened
in
vain
for
one
word
from
his
overburdened
heart
that
i
being
a
woman
need
not
tax
every
nerve
to
suppress
emotion
but
could
let
the
tears
stream
down
my
face
on
all
our
silent
way
back
to
the
city
then
began
the
gathering
of
our
traps
a
hasty
collection
of
a
few
suitable
things
for
a
southern
climate
orders
about
shipping
the
horses
a
wild
tearing
around
of
the
improvident
thoughtless
staff
good
fighters
but
poor
providers
for
themselves
most
of
them
were
young
men
for
whom
my
husband
had
applied
when
he
was
made
a
brigadier
his
first
step
after
his
promotion
was
to
write
home
for
his
schoolmates
or
select
aides
from
his
early
friends
then
in
service
it
was
a
comfort
when
i
found
myself
grieving
over
the
parting
with
my
husband
division
that
our
military
family
were
to
go
with
us
at
dark
we
were
on
the
cars
with
our
faces
turned
southward
to
general
custer
this
move
had
been
unexpected
general
sheridan
knew
that
he
needed
little
time
to
decide
so
he
sent
for
him
as
soon
as
we
encamped
at
arlington
after
our
march
up
from
richmond
and
asked
if
he
would
like
to
take
command
of
a
division
of
cavalry
on
the
red
river
in
louisiana
and
march
throughout
texas
with
the
possibility
of
eventually
entering
mexico
our
government
was
just
then
thinking
it
was
high
time
the
french
knew
that
if
there
was
any
invasion
of
mexico
with
an
idea
of
a
complete
gobbling
up
of
that
country
the
one
to
do
the
seizure
and
gather
in
the
spoils
was
brother
jonathan
very
wisely
general
custer
kept
this
latter
part
of
the
understanding
why
he
was
sent
south
from
the
weepy
part
of
his
family
he
preferred
transportation
by
steamer
rather
than
to
be
floated
southward
by
floods
of
feminine
tears
all
i
knew
was
that
texas
having
been
so
outside
of
the
limit
where
the
armies
marched
and
fought
was
unhappily
unaware
that
the
war
was
over
and
continued
a
career
of
bushwhacking
and
lawlessness
that
was
only
tolerated
from
necessity
before
the
surrender
and
must
now
cease
it
was
considered
expedient
to
fit
out
two
detachments
of
cavalry
and
start
them
on
a
march
through
the
northern
and
southern
portions
of
texas
as
a
means
of
informing
that
isolated
state
that
depredations
and
raids
might
come
to
an
end
in
my
mind
texas
then
seemed
the
place
but
i
was
indifferent
to
the
points
of
the
compass
so
long
as
i
was
not
left
behind
the
train
in
which
we
set
out
was
crowded
with
a
joyous
rollicking
irrepressible
throng
of
discharged
officers
and
soldiers
going
home
to
make
their
swords
into
ploughshares
everybody
talked
with
everybody
and
all
spoke
at
once
the
babel
was
unceasing
night
and
day
there
was
not
a
vein
that
was
not
bursting
with
joy
the
swift
blood
rushed
into
the
heart
and
out
again
laden
with
one
glad
thought
the
war
is
over
at
the
stations
soldiers
tumbled
out
and
rushed
into
some
waiting
arms
while
bands
tooted
excited
welcomes
no
one
instrument
according
with
another
because
of
throats
overcharged
already
with
bursting
notes
of
patriotism
that
would
not
be
set
music
the
customary
train
of
street
gamins
who
imitate
all
parades
and
promptly
copy
the
pomp
of
the
circus
and
other
processions
stepped
off
in
a
mimic
march
following
the
conquering
heroes
as
they
were
lost
to
our
sight
down
the
street
going
home
sometimes
the
voices
of
the
hilarious
crowd
at
the
station
were
stilled
and
a
hush
of
reverent
silence
preceded
the
careful
lifting
from
the
car
of
a
stretcher
bearing
a
form
broken
and
bleeding
from
wounds
willingly
borne
that
the
home
to
which
he
was
coming
might
be
unharmed
tender
women
received
and
hovered
lovingly
over
the
precious
freight
strong
arms
carried
him
away
and
we
contrasted
the
devoted
care
the
love
that
would
teach
new
ways
to
heal
with
the
condition
of
the
poor
fellows
we
had
left
in
the
crowded
washington
hospitals
attended
only
by
strangers
some
of
the
soldiers
were
on
our
train
so
deftly
mended
that
they
stumped
their
way
down
the
platform
and
began
their
tramp
through
life
amidst
the
loud
huzzas
that
a
maimed
hero
then
received
they
even
joked
about
their
misfortunes
i
remember
one
undaunted
fellow
with
the
fresh
color
of
buoyant
youth
beginning
again
to
dye
his
cheek
even
after
the
amputation
of
a
leg
which
so
depletes
the
system
he
said
some
grave
words
of
wisdom
to
me
in
such
a
roguish
way
and
followed
up
his
counsel
by
adding
you
ought
to
heed
such
advice
from
a
man
with
one
foot
in
the
grave
we
missed
all
the
all
the
glorification
awarded
to
the
hero
general
custer
said
no
word
of
regret
he
had
accepted
the
offer
for
further
active
service
and
gratefully
thanked
his
chief
for
giving
him
the
opportunity
i
however
should
have
liked
to
have
him
get
some
of
the
celebrations
that
our
country
was
then
showering
on
its
defenders
i
missed
the
bonfires
the
processions
the
public
meeting
of
distinguished
citizens
who
eloquently
thanked
the
veterans
the
editorials
that
lauded
each
townsman
deed
the
poetry
in
the
corner
of
the
newspaper
that
was
dedicated
to
a
hero
the
overflow
of
a
heart
singing
praise
to
her
military
idol
but
the
cannon
were
fired
the
drums
beat
the
music
sounded
for
all
but
us
offices
of
trust
were
offered
at
once
to
men
coming
home
to
private
life
and
towns
and
cities
felt
themselves
honored
because
some
one
of
their
number
had
gone
out
and
made
himself
so
glorious
a
name
that
his
very
home
became
celebrated
he
was
made
the
mayor
or
the
congressman
and
given
a
home
which
it
would
have
taken
him
many
years
of
hard
work
to
earn
song
story
and
history
have
long
recounted
what
a
hero
is
to
a
woman
imagination
pictured
to
my
eye
troops
of
beautiful
women
gathering
around
each
gallant
soldier
on
his
return
the
adoring
eyes
spoke
admiration
while
the
tongue
subtly
wove
in
many
a
sentence
its
meed
of
praise
the
general
and
his
staff
of
boys
loving
and
reverencing
women
missed
what
men
wisely
count
the
sweetest
of
adulation
one
slip
of
a
girl
had
to
do
all
their
banqueting
cannonading
bonfiring
and
general
hallelujahs
all
the
way
to
texas
and
yes
even
after
we
got
there
for
the
southern
women
true
to
their
idea
of
patriotism
turned
their
pretty
faces
away
from
our
handsome
fellows
and
resisted
for
a
long
time
even
the
mildest
flirtation
the
car
was
then
unthought
of
in
the
minds
of
those
who
plan
new
luxuries
as
our
race
demand
more
ease
and
elegance
there
was
a
ladies
car
to
which
no
men
unaccompanied
by
women
were
admitted
it
was
never
so
full
as
the
other
coaches
and
was
much
cleaner
and
better
ventilated
this
was
at
first
a
damper
to
the
enjoyment
of
a
military
family
who
lost
no
opportunity
of
being
together
for
it
compelled
the
men
to
remain
in
the
other
cars
the
scamp
among
us
devised
a
plan
to
outwit
the
brakemen
he
borrowed
my
bag
just
before
we
were
obliged
to
change
cars
and
after
waiting
till
the
general
and
i
were
safely
seated
boldly
walked
up
and
demanded
entrance
on
the
plea
that
he
had
a
lady
inside
this
scheme
worked
so
well
that
the
others
took
up
the
cue
and
my
cloak
bag
umbrella
and
parcel
of
books
and
papers
were
distributed
among
the
rest
before
we
stopped
and
were
used
to
obtain
entrance
into
the
better
car
even
our
faithful
servant
eliza
was
unexpectedly
overwhelmed
with
urgent
offers
of
assistance
for
she
always
went
with
us
and
sat
by
the
door
this
plan
was
a
great
success
in
so
far
as
it
kept
our
party
together
but
it
proved
disastrous
to
me
as
the
scamp
forgot
my
bag
at
some
station
and
i
was
minus
all
those
articles
that
seem
indispensable
to
a
comfort
in
that
plight
i
had
to
journey
until
in
some
merciful
detention
we
had
an
hour
in
which
to
seek
out
a
shop
and
hastily
make
the
necessary
purchases
at
one
of
our
stops
for
dinner
we
all
made
the
usual
rush
for
the
as
in
the
confusion
of
trains
at
that
excited
time
it
was
necessary
to
hurry
and
besides
as
there
were
delays
and
irregularities
in
traveling
on
account
of
the
of
the
troops
we
never
knew
how
long
it
might
be
before
the
next
was
reached
the
general
insisted
upon
eliza
going
right
with
us
as
no
other
table
was
provided
the
proprietor
already
rendered
indifferent
to
people
comfort
by
his
extraordinary
gains
said
there
was
no
table
for
servants
eliza
the
of
maids
begged
to
go
back
dinnerless
into
the
car
but
the
general
insisted
on
her
sitting
down
between
us
at
the
crowded
table
a
position
so
unusual
and
to
her
so
totally
out
of
place
made
her
appetite
waver
and
it
vanished
entirely
when
the
proprietor
came
and
told
the
general
that
no
colored
folks
could
be
allowed
at
his
table
my
husband
quietly
replied
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
give
the
woman
that
place
as
the
house
had
provided
no
other
the
determined
man
still
stood
threateningly
over
us
demanding
her
removal
and
eliza
uneasily
and
nervously
tried
to
go
i
trembled
and
the
fork
failed
to
carry
the
food
owing
to
a
very
wobbly
arm
the
general
firmly
refused
the
staff
rose
about
us
and
all
along
the
table
up
sprang
men
we
had
supposed
to
be
citizens
as
they
were
in
the
dress
of
civilians
general
stand
your
ground
we
back
you
the
woman
shall
have
food
how
little
we
realize
in
these
piping
times
of
peace
how
great
a
flame
a
little
fire
kindled
in
those
agitating
days
the
proprietor
slunk
back
to
his
desk
the
general
and
his
hungry
staff
went
on
eating
as
calmly
as
ever
eliza
hung
her
embarrassed
head
and
her
mistress
idly
twirled
her
useless
fork
while
the
proprietor
made
clear
gain
on
two
women
that
were
too
frightened
to
swallow
a
mouthful
i
spread
a
sandwich
for
eliza
while
the
general
mindful
of
the
returning
hunger
of
the
terrified
woman
and
perfectly
indifferent
as
to
making
himself
ridiculous
with
parcels
marched
by
the
infuriated
but
subdued
bully
with
either
a
whole
pie
or
some
such
modest
capture
in
his
hand
we
had
put
some
hours
of
travel
between
ourselves
and
the
place
which
came
so
near
being
a
before
eliza
could
eat
what
we
had
brought
for
her
i
wonder
if
any
one
is
waiting
for
me
to
say
that
this
incident
happened
south
of
the
mason
and
dixon
line
it
did
not
it
was
in
ohio
i
remember
the
place
after
all
the
memory
over
which
one
complains
when
he
finds
how
little
he
can
recall
has
its
advantages
it
hopelessly
buries
the
names
of
persons
and
places
when
one
starts
to
tell
tales
out
of
school
it
is
like
extracting
the
fangs
from
a
rattlesnake
the
reptile
like
the
story
may
be
very
disagreeable
but
i
can
only
hope
that
a
tale
unadorned
with
names
or
places
is
as
harmless
as
a
snake
with
its
poison
withdrawn
i
must
stop
a
moment
and
give
our
eliza
on
whom
this
battle
was
waged
a
little
space
in
this
story
for
she
occupied
no
small
part
in
the
events
of
the
six
years
after
and
when
she
left
us
and
took
an
upward
step
in
life
by
marrying
a
colored
lawyer
i
could
not
reconcile
myself
to
the
loss
and
though
she
has
lived
through
all
the
grandeur
of
a
union
with
a
man
who
gets
a
heap
of
money
for
his
speeches
in
politics
and
brass
bands
to
meet
him
at
the
stations
miss
libbie
she
came
to
my
little
home
not
long
since
with
tears
of
joy
illuminating
the
bright
bronze
of
her
expressive
face
it
reminded
me
so
of
the
first
time
i
knew
that
the
negro
race
regarded
shades
of
color
as
a
distinctive
feature
a
beauty
or
a
blemish
as
it
might
be
eliza
stood
in
front
of
a
bronze
medallion
of
my
husband
when
it
was
first
sent
from
the
artist
in
and
amused
him
hugely
by
saying
in
that
partnership
manner
she
had
in
our
affairs
why
ginnel
it
jest
my
color
after
that
i
noticed
that
she
referred
to
her
race
according
to
the
deepness
of
tint
telling
me
with
scorn
of
one
of
her
numerous
suitors
why
miss
libbie
he
needent
think
to
shine
up
to
me
he
nothing
but
a
black
african
i
am
thus
introducing
eliza
color
and
all
that
she
may
not
seem
the
vague
character
of
other
days
and
whoever
chances
to
meet
her
will
find
in
her
a
good
war
historian
a
modest
chronicler
of
a
really
and
courageous
life
it
was
rather
a
surprise
to
me
that
she
was
not
an
old
woman
when
i
saw
her
again
this
autumn
after
so
many
years
but
she
is
not
yet
fifty
i
imagine
she
did
so
much
mothering
in
those
days
when
she
comforted
me
in
my
loneliness
and
quieted
me
in
my
frights
that
i
counted
her
old
even
then
eliza
requests
that
she
be
permitted
to
make
her
little
bow
to
the
reader
and
repeat
a
wish
of
hers
that
i
take
great
pains
in
quoting
her
and
not
represent
her
as
saying
like
and
she
says
her
people
in
virginia
whom
she
reverences
and
loves
always
taught
her
not
to
say
them
words
and
if
they
should
see
what
i
have
told
you
they
feel
bad
to
think
i
forgot
if
and
appear
occasionally
in
my
efforts
to
transfer
her
literally
to
these
pages
it
is
only
a
on
her
part
besides
she
has
lived
north
so
long
now
there
is
not
that
distinctive
dialect
peculiar
to
the
southern
servant
in
her
excitement
narrating
our
scenes
of
danger
or
pleasure
or
merriment
she
occasionally
drops
into
expressions
that
belonged
to
her
early
life
it
is
the
fault
of
her
historian
if
these
phrases
get
into
print
to
me
they
are
charming
for
they
are
eliza
in
undress
uniform
eliza
without
her
company
manners
she
describes
her
leaving
the
old
plantation
during
war
times
i
jined
the
ginnel
at
amosville
rappahannock
county
in
august
everybody
was
excited
over
freedom
and
i
wanted
to
see
how
it
was
everybody
keeps
asking
me
why
i
left
i
ca
see
why
they
ca
recollect
what
war
was
for
and
that
we
was
all
bound
to
try
and
see
for
ourselves
how
it
was
after
the
everybody
was
up
for
liberty
and
i
wasent
goin
to
stay
home
when
everybody
else
was
the
day
i
came
into
camp
there
was
a
good
many
other
darkeys
from
all
about
our
place
we
was
round
waitin
when
i
first
seed
the
ginnel
he
and
captain
lyon
cum
up
to
me
and
the
ginnel
says
name
i
told
him
eliza
and
he
says
looking
me
all
over
fust
eliza
would
you
like
to
cum
and
live
with
me
i
waited
a
minute
miss
libbie
i
looked
all
over
too
and
finally
i
sez
reckon
i
would
so
the
bargain
was
fixed
up
but
oh
how
awful
lonesome
i
was
at
fust
and
i
was
afraid
of
everything
in
the
shape
of
war
i
used
to
wish
myself
back
on
the
old
plantation
with
my
mother
i
was
mighty
glad
when
you
cum
miss
libbie
why
sometimes
i
never
sot
eyes
on
a
woman
for
weeks
at
a
time
eliza
story
of
her
war
life
is
too
long
for
these
pages
but
in
spite
of
her
confession
of
being
so
she
was
a
marvel
of
courage
she
was
captured
by
the
enemy
escaped
and
found
her
way
back
after
sunset
to
the
general
camp
she
had
strange
and
narrow
escapes
she
says
quaintly
well
miss
libbie
i
set
in
to
see
the
war
beginning
and
end
there
was
many
niggers
that
cut
into
cities
and
huddled
up
thar
and
laid
around
and
saw
hard
times
but
i
went
to
see
the
end
and
i
stuck
it
out
i
allus
thought
this
that
i
did
set
down
to
wait
to
have
all
free
i
helped
to
free
myself
i
was
all
ready
to
step
to
the
front
whenever
i
was
called
upon
even
if
i
did
shoulder
the
musket
well
i
went
to
the
end
and
there
many
folks
says
that
a
woman
ca
follow
the
army
without
throwing
themselves
away
but
i
know
better
i
went
in
and
i
cum
out
with
the
respect
of
the
men
and
the
officers
illustration
eliza
cooking
under
fire
eliza
often
cooked
under
fire
and
only
lately
one
of
the
staff
recounting
war
days
described
her
as
she
was
preparing
the
general
dinner
in
the
field
a
shell
would
burst
near
her
she
would
turn
her
head
in
anger
at
being
disturbed
unconscious
that
she
was
observed
begin
to
growl
to
herself
about
being
obliged
to
move
but
take
up
her
kettle
and
march
farther
away
make
a
new
fire
and
begin
cooking
as
unperturbed
as
if
it
were
an
ordinary
disturbance
instead
of
a
sky
filled
with
bits
of
falling
shell
i
do
not
repeat
that
polite
fiction
of
having
been
on
the
spot
as
neither
the
artist
nor
i
had
eliza
grit
or
pluck
but
we
arranged
the
and
eliza
fell
into
the
exact
expression
as
she
volubly
began
telling
the
tale
of
how
mad
those
busting
shells
used
to
make
her
it
is
an
excellent
likeness
even
though
eliza
objects
to
the
bandana
which
she
has
abandoned
in
her
new
position
and
i
must
not
forget
that
i
found
her
one
day
turning
her
head
critically
from
side
to
side
looking
at
her
picture
and
out
of
regard
to
her
will
mention
that
her
nose
of
which
she
is
very
proud
is
she
fears
a
touch
too
flat
in
the
sketch
she
speaks
of
her
dress
as
completely
whittled
out
with
bullets
but
she
would
like
me
to
mention
that
she
do
wear
them
rags
now
when
eliza
reached
new
york
this
past
autumn
she
told
me
when
i
asked
her
to
choose
where
she
would
go
as
my
time
was
to
be
entirely
given
to
her
that
she
wanted
first
to
go
to
the
fifth
avenue
hotel
and
see
if
it
looked
just
the
same
as
it
did
when
you
was
a
bride
miss
libbie
and
the
ginnel
took
you
and
me
there
on
leave
of
absence
we
went
through
the
halls
and
narrowly
watched
by
the
who
stands
guard
over
tramps
but
fortified
by
my
voice
she
oh
and
ah
over
its
grandeur
to
her
heart
content
one
day
i
left
her
in
madison
square
to
go
on
a
business
errand
and
cautioned
her
not
to
stray
away
when
i
returned
i
asked
anxiously
did
any
one
speak
to
you
eliza
miss
libbie
as
nonchalant
and
as
complacent
as
if
it
were
her
idea
of
new
york
hospitality
then
she
begged
me
to
go
round
the
square
to
hunt
a
lady
from
avenue
a
who
see
you
pass
with
me
miss
libbie
and
said
she
knowed
you
was
a
lady
though
i
reckon
she
could
for
me
and
you
bein
together
we
found
the
avenue
a
lady
and
i
was
presented
and
to
her
satisfaction
admired
the
baby
that
had
been
brought
over
to
that
blessed
of
our
city
the
elevated
railroad
was
a
surprise
to
eliza
she
did
believe
it
would
be
so
high
at
that
celebrated
curve
on
the
sixth
avenue
line
where
monsieur
de
lesseps
even
exclaimed
mon
dieu
but
the
americans
are
a
brave
people
the
poor
frightened
woman
clung
to
me
and
whispered
miss
libbie
could
we
get
down
anyway
miss
libbie
seed
enough
i
can
tell
the
folks
at
home
all
about
it
oh
i
never
did
to
be
so
near
heaven
till
i
went
up
for
good
at
the
brooklyn
bridge
she
demurred
she
is
so
intelligent
that
i
wanted
to
have
her
see
the
shipping
the
wharves
the
harbor
and
the
statue
of
liberty
but
nothing
kept
her
from
flight
save
her
desire
to
tell
her
townspeople
that
she
had
seen
the
place
where
the
crank
jumped
off
the
in
answer
to
my
inquiry
commanded
us
in
martial
tones
to
stay
still
till
he
said
the
word
and
when
the
wagon
crossing
passed
the
spot
and
the
maintainer
of
the
peace
said
now
eliza
shivered
and
whispered
let
go
home
miss
libbie
i
dun
took
the
cullud
part
of
the
town
fo
i
come
the
white
folks
hai
seen
what
i
has
and
they
be
took
when
i
tell
and
off
she
toddled
for
eliza
is
not
the
slender
woman
i
once
knew
her
her
description
of
the
wild
west
exhibition
was
most
droll
i
sent
her
down
because
we
had
lived
through
so
many
of
the
scenes
depicted
and
i
felt
sure
that
nothing
would
recall
so
vividly
the
life
on
the
frontier
as
that
most
realistic
and
faithful
representation
of
a
western
life
that
has
ceased
to
be
with
advancing
civilization
she
went
to
cody
tent
after
the
exhibition
to
present
my
card
of
introduction
for
he
had
served
as
general
custer
scout
after
eliza
left
us
and
she
was
therefore
unknown
to
him
except
by
hearsay
they
had
twenty
subjects
in
common
for
eliza
in
her
way
was
as
deserving
of
praise
as
was
the
courageous
cody
she
was
delighted
with
all
she
saw
and
on
her
return
her
description
of
it
mingled
with
imitations
of
the
voices
of
the
hawkers
and
the
performers
was
so
incoherent
that
it
presented
only
a
confused
jumble
to
my
ears
the
buffalo
were
a
surprise
a
wonderful
revival
to
her
of
those
when
our
plains
were
darkened
by
the
herds
when
the
buffalo
cum
in
i
was
ready
to
leap
up
and
holler
miss
libbie
it
me
of
ole
times
they
made
me
think
of
the
fifteen
the
ginnel
fust
struck
in
kansas
he
jest
pushed
down
his
ole
hat
and
went
after
well
miss
libbie
when
cody
come
up
i
see
at
once
his
back
and
hips
was
built
precisely
like
the
ginnel
and
when
i
come
on
to
his
tent
i
jest
said
to
him
buffalo
bill
when
you
cum
up
to
the
stand
and
wheeled
round
i
said
to
myself
if
he
ai
the
image
of
ginnel
custer
in
battle
i
never
seed
any
one
that
was
i
jest
wish
he
come
to
my
town
and
give
a
show
he
could
have
the
hull
fairground
there
my
he
could
raise
money
so
fast
take
him
long
to
for
a
church
and
the
shootin
and
ridin
why
miss
libbie
when
i
seed
one
of
them
ponies
brought
out
i
know
he
was
one
of
the
hatefulest
sulkiest
ponies
that
ever
lived
he
was
and
curvin
and
he
jest
stretched
his
ole
neck
and
throwed
the
men
as
fast
as
ever
they
got
on
after
we
had
strolled
through
the
streets
for
many
days
eliza
always
amusing
me
by
her
droll
comments
she
said
to
me
one
day
miss
libbie
you
do
take
notice
when
me
and
you
walking
on
into
and
at
the
new
things
i
never
see
before
how
the
folks
does
stare
at
us
but
i
see
and
i
can
see
and
sayin
to
theirsel
i
do
declar
that
a
lady
there
ai
no
manner
of
doubt
she
one
of
the
bong
tong
but
whatever
she
with
that
old
scrub
nigger
i
ca
make
out
i
can
hardly
express
what
a
recreation
and
delight
it
was
to
go
about
with
this
humorous
woman
and
listen
to
her
comments
her
unique
criticisms
her
grateful
delight
when
she
turned
on
the
street
to
say
oh
a
good
time
me
and
you
is
having
miss
libbie
and
i
will
them
people
at
home
the
best
of
it
all
was
the
manner
in
which
she
brought
back
our
past
and
the
hundred
small
events
we
recalled
which
were
made
more
vivid
by
the
imitation
of
voice
walk
gesture
she
gave
in
speaking
of
those
we
followed
in
the
old
marching
days
on
this
journey
to
texas
some
accident
happened
to
our
engine
and
detained
us
all
night
we
campaigners
accustomed
to
all
sorts
of
unexpected
inconveniences
had
learned
not
to
mind
discomforts
each
officer
sank
out
of
sight
into
his
collar
and
slept
on
by
the
hour
while
i
slumbered
till
morning
curled
up
in
a
heap
thankful
to
have
the
luxury
of
one
seat
to
myself
we
rather
gloried
over
the
citizens
who
tramped
up
and
down
the
aisle
groaning
and
becoming
more
emphatic
in
their
language
as
the
night
advanced
indulging
in
the
belief
that
the
women
were
too
sound
asleep
to
hear
them
i
wakened
enough
to
hear
one
old
man
say
fretfully
and
with
many
adjectives
just
see
how
those
army
folks
sleep
they
can
tumble
down
anywhere
while
i
am
so
lame
and
sore
from
the
place
i
am
in
i
even
doze
as
morning
came
we
noticed
our
scamp
at
the
other
end
of
the
car
with
his
legs
stretched
comfortably
on
the
seat
turned
over
in
front
of
him
all
this
unusual
luxury
he
accounted
for
afterward
by
telling
us
the
trick
that
his
ingenuity
had
suggested
to
obtain
more
room
you
see
the
wag
said
two
old
codgers
sat
down
in
front
of
my
pal
and
me
late
last
night
and
went
on
counting
up
their
gains
in
the
rise
of
corn
owing
to
the
war
which
to
say
the
least
was
harrowing
to
us
poor
devils
who
had
fought
the
battles
that
had
made
them
rich
and
left
us
without
a
i
concluded
if
that
was
all
they
had
done
for
their
country
two
of
its
brave
defenders
had
more
of
a
right
to
the
seat
than
they
had
i
just
turned
to
h
and
began
solemnly
to
talk
about
what
store
i
set
by
my
old
army
coat
then
on
the
seat
they
occupied
said
i
could
give
it
up
though
i
had
been
obliged
to
cover
a
comrade
who
had
died
of
i
not
being
afraid
of
contagion
having
had
varioloid
well
i
got
that
far
when
the
eyes
of
the
old
galoots
started
out
of
their
heads
and
they
vamoosed
the
ranche
i
can
tell
you
and
i
saw
them
peering
through
the
window
at
the
end
of
the
next
car
the
horror
still
in
their
faces
the
general
exploded
with
merriment
how
strange
it
seems
to
contrast
those
noisy
boisterous
times
when
everybody
shouted
with
laughter
called
loudly
from
one
end
of
the
car
to
the
other
told
stories
for
the
whole
public
to
hear
and
sang
with
the
quiet
orderly
travelers
of
nowadays
who
even
in
the
tremor
of
meeting
or
parting
speak
below
their
breath
and
ashamed
of
emotion
quickly
wink
back
to
its
source
the
prehistoric
tear
we
bade
to
railroads
at
louisville
and
the
journeying
south
was
then
made
by
steamer
how
peculiar
it
seemed
to
us
accustomed
as
we
were
to
lake
craft
with
deep
hulls
to
see
for
the
first
time
those
boats
drawing
so
little
water
with
several
stories
and
upper
decks
loaded
with
freight
i
could
hardly
rid
myself
of
the
fear
that
being
so
we
would
blow
over
the
tempests
of
our
western
lakes
were
then
my
only
idea
of
sailing
weather
then
the
long
sloping
levees
the
preparations
for
the
rise
of
water
the
strange
sensation
when
the
river
was
high
of
looking
over
the
embankment
down
upon
the
earth
it
is
a
novel
feeling
to
be
for
the
first
time
on
a
great
river
with
such
a
current
as
the
mississippi
flowing
on
above
the
level
of
the
plantations
hemmed
in
by
an
embankment
on
either
side
though
we
saw
the
manner
of
its
construction
at
one
point
where
the
levee
was
being
repaired
and
found
how
firmly
and
substantially
the
earth
was
fortified
with
stone
and
logs
against
the
river
it
still
seemed
to
me
an
unnatural
sort
of
voyaging
to
be
above
the
level
of
the
ground
and
my
tremors
on
the
subject
and
other
novel
experiences
were
instantly
made
use
of
as
a
new
and
fruitful
source
of
practical
jokes
for
instance
the
steamer
bumped
into
the
shore
anywhere
it
happened
to
be
wooded
and
an
army
of
negroes
appeared
running
over
the
like
ants
sometimes
at
night
the
pine
torches
and
the
resinous
knots
burning
in
iron
baskets
slung
over
the
side
of
the
boat
made
a
weird
and
gruesome
sight
the
shadows
were
so
black
the
streams
of
light
so
intense
while
the
hurrying
negroes
loaded
on
the
wood
under
the
brutal
voice
of
a
steamer
mate
once
a
negro
fell
in
they
made
a
pretense
of
rescuing
him
gave
it
up
soon
and
up
hurried
our
scamp
to
the
upper
deck
to
tell
me
the
horrible
tale
he
had
good
command
of
language
and
allowed
no
scruples
to
spoil
a
story
after
that
i
imagined
at
every
night
some
poor
soul
was
swept
down
under
the
boat
and
off
into
eternity
the
general
was
sorry
for
me
and
sometimes
when
i
imagined
the
calls
of
the
crew
to
be
the
despairing
wail
of
a
dying
man
he
made
pilgrimages
for
my
sake
to
the
lower
deck
to
make
sure
that
no
one
was
drowned
my
imaginings
were
not
always
so
respected
for
the
occasion
gave
too
good
an
opportunity
for
a
joke
to
be
passed
quietly
by
the
scamp
and
my
husband
put
their
heads
together
soon
after
this
and
prepared
a
tale
for
the
old
lady
as
they
called
me
as
we
were
about
to
make
a
landing
they
ran
to
me
and
said
come
libbie
hurry
up
hurry
up
you
miss
the
fun
if
you
do
scrabble
miss
what
was
my
very
natural
question
and
exactly
the
reply
they
wanted
me
to
make
why
they
going
to
bury
a
dead
man
when
we
land
i
exclaimed
in
horror
another
man
drowned
how
can
you
speak
so
irreverently
of
death
with
a
do
you
suppose
the
mate
cares
for
one
darkey
more
or
less
they
dragged
me
to
the
deck
there
i
saw
the
great
cable
which
was
used
to
tie
us
up
fastened
to
a
strong
spar
the
two
ends
of
which
were
buried
in
the
bank
the
ground
was
hollowed
out
underneath
the
centre
and
the
rope
slipped
under
to
fasten
it
around
the
log
after
i
had
watched
this
process
of
securing
our
boat
to
the
shore
these
irrepressibles
said
solemnly
the
sad
ceremony
is
now
ended
and
no
other
will
take
place
till
we
tie
up
at
the
next
stop
when
it
dawned
upon
me
that
tying
up
was
called
in
steamer
vernacular
burying
a
dead
man
my
eyes
returned
to
their
proper
place
in
the
sockets
breath
came
back
and
indignation
filled
my
soul
language
deserts
us
at
such
moments
and
i
resorted
to
force
the
was
accounted
one
of
the
largest
and
most
beautiful
steamers
that
had
ever
been
on
the
mississippi
river
her
expenses
being
a
day
the
decorations
were
sumptuous
and
we
enjoyed
every
luxury
we
ate
our
dinners
to
very
good
music
which
the
boat
furnished
we
had
been
on
plain
fare
too
long
not
to
watch
with
eagerness
the
arrival
of
the
procession
of
negro
waiters
who
each
day
came
in
from
the
with
some
new
device
in
cake
ices
or
confectionery
there
was
a
beautiful
ruth
gleaning
in
a
field
in
a
painting
that
filled
the
semicircle
over
the
entrance
of
the
cabin
ruths
with
sheaves
held
up
the
branches
of
the
chandeliers
while
the
pretty
gleaner
looked
out
from
the
glass
of
the
stateroom
doors
the
captain
being
very
patient
as
well
as
polite
we
pervaded
every
corner
of
the
great
boat
the
general
and
his
were
too
accustomed
to
activity
to
be
quiet
in
the
cabin
even
that
unapproachable
man
at
the
wheel
yielded
to
our
longing
eyes
and
let
us
into
his
round
tower
oh
how
good
he
was
to
me
the
general
took
me
up
there
and
the
pilot
made
a
place
for
us
where
with
my
bit
of
work
i
listened
for
hours
to
his
stories
my
husband
made
fifty
trips
up
and
down
sometimes
detained
when
we
were
nearing
an
interesting
point
to
hear
the
story
of
the
crevasse
such
tales
were
thrilling
enough
even
for
him
accustomed
as
he
then
was
to
the
most
exciting
scenes
the
pilot
pointed
out
places
where
the
river
wild
with
the
rush
and
fury
of
spring
freshets
had
burst
its
way
through
the
levees
and
sweeping
over
a
peninsula
returned
to
the
channel
beyond
utterly
annihilating
and
sinking
out
of
sight
forever
the
ground
where
happy
people
had
lived
on
their
plantations
it
was
a
sad
time
to
take
that
journey
and
even
in
the
midst
of
our
intense
enjoyment
of
the
novelty
of
the
trip
the
freedom
from
anxiety
and
the
absence
of
responsibility
of
any
kind
i
recall
how
the
general
grieved
over
the
destruction
of
plantations
by
the
breaks
in
the
levee
the
work
on
these
embankments
was
done
by
assessment
i
think
they
were
cared
for
as
our
roads
and
bridges
are
kept
in
order
and
when
men
were
absent
in
the
war
only
the
negroes
were
left
to
attend
to
the
repairing
but
the
inundations
then
were
slight
compared
with
many
from
which
the
state
has
since
suffered
in
thirty
parishes
were
either
wholly
or
partly
overflowed
by
an
extraordinary
rise
in
the
river
on
our
trip
we
saw
one
plantation
after
another
submerged
the
grand
old
houses
abandoned
and
standing
in
lakes
of
water
while
the
negro
quarters
and
barns
were
almost
out
of
sight
sometimes
the
cattle
huddled
on
a
little
rise
of
ground
helpless
and
pitiful
we
wished
as
we
used
to
do
in
that
beautiful
shenandoah
valley
that
if
wars
must
come
the
devastation
of
homes
might
be
avoided
and
i
usually
added
with
one
of
the
totally
impracticable
suggestions
conjured
up
by
a
woman
that
battles
might
be
fought
in
desert
places
a
southern
woman
who
afterward
entertained
us
described
in
the
graphic
and
varied
language
which
is
their
gift
the
breaking
of
the
levee
on
their
own
plantation
how
stealthily
the
small
stream
of
water
crept
on
and
on
until
their
first
warning
was
its
progress
past
their
house
then
the
excitement
and
rush
of
all
the
household
to
the
crevasse
the
hasty
gathering
in
of
the
and
the
homely
devices
for
stopping
the
break
until
more
substantial
materials
could
be
gathered
it
was
a
race
for
life
on
all
sides
each
one
old
or
young
knew
that
his
safety
depended
on
the
superhuman
effort
of
the
first
hour
of
danger
in
our
safe
homes
we
scarcely
realize
what
it
would
be
to
look
out
from
our
windows
upon
what
seemed
to
me
a
small
and
insufficient
mound
of
earth
stretching
along
the
frontage
of
an
estate
and
know
that
it
was
our
only
rampart
against
a
rushing
flood
which
seemed
human
in
its
revengeful
desire
to
engulf
us
the
general
was
intensely
interested
in
those
portions
of
the
country
where
both
naval
and
land
warfare
had
been
carried
on
at
island
no
and
fort
pillow
especially
there
seemed
even
then
no
evidence
that
fighting
had
gone
on
so
lately
the
luxuriant
vegetation
of
the
south
had
covered
the
fortifications
nature
seemed
hastening
to
throw
a
mantle
over
soil
that
had
so
lately
been
reddened
with
such
a
precious
dye
the
fighting
had
been
so
desperate
at
the
latter
point
it
is
reported
the
confederate
general
forrest
said
the
river
was
dyed
with
the
blood
of
the
slaughtered
for
two
hundred
yards
at
one
of
our
stops
on
the
route
the
confederate
general
hood
came
on
board
to
go
to
a
town
a
short
distance
below
and
my
husband
hearing
he
was
on
the
boat
hastened
to
seek
him
out
and
introduce
himself
such
reunions
have
now
become
common
i
am
thankful
to
say
but
i
confess
to
watching
curiously
every
expression
of
those
men
as
it
seemed
very
early
in
those
times
of
excited
and
vehement
conduct
to
begin
such
overtures
and
yet
i
did
not
forget
that
my
husband
sent
messages
of
friendship
to
his
classmates
on
the
other
side
throughout
the
war
as
i
watched
this
meeting
they
looked
while
they
grasped
each
other
hand
as
if
they
were
friends
happily
united
after
they
had
carried
on
an
animated
conversation
for
awhile
my
husband
always
thinking
how
to
share
his
enjoyment
hurried
to
bring
me
into
the
group
general
custer
had
already
taught
me
even
in
those
bitter
times
that
he
knew
his
classmates
fought
from
their
convictions
of
right
and
that
now
the
war
was
over
i
must
not
be
adding
fuel
to
a
fire
that
both
sides
should
strive
to
smother
general
hood
was
tall
fair
dignified
and
soldierly
he
used
his
crutch
with
difficulty
and
it
was
an
effort
for
him
to
rise
when
i
was
presented
we
three
instantly
resumed
the
war
talk
that
my
coming
had
interrupted
the
men
plied
each
other
with
questions
as
to
the
situation
of
troops
at
certain
engagements
and
the
general
fairly
bombarded
general
hood
with
inquiries
about
the
action
on
their
side
in
different
campaigns
at
that
time
nothing
had
been
written
for
northern
papers
and
magazines
by
the
south
all
we
knew
was
from
the
brief
accounts
in
the
southern
newspapers
that
our
pickets
exchanged
and
from
papers
captured
or
received
from
europe
by
way
of
we
were
greatly
amused
by
the
comical
manner
in
which
general
hood
described
his
efforts
to
suit
himself
to
an
artificial
leg
after
he
had
contributed
his
own
to
his
beloved
cause
in
his
campaigns
he
was
obliged
to
carry
an
extra
one
in
case
of
accident
to
the
one
he
wore
which
was
strapped
to
his
led
horse
he
asked
me
to
picture
the
surprise
of
the
troops
who
captured
all
the
reserve
horses
at
one
time
and
found
this
false
leg
of
his
suspended
from
the
saddle
he
said
he
had
tried
five
at
different
times
to
see
which
of
the
inventions
was
lightest
and
easiest
to
wear
and
i
am
obliged
to
confess
custer
much
as
you
may
imagine
it
goes
against
me
to
do
so
that
of
the
five
english
german
french
yankee
and
confederate
the
yankee
leg
was
the
best
of
all
when
general
custer
carefully
helped
the
maimed
hero
down
the
cabin
stairs
and
over
the
gangway
we
bade
him
with
real
regret
so
quickly
do
soldiers
make
and
cement
a
friendship
when
both
find
the
same
qualities
to
admire
in
each
other
the
novelty
of
mississippi
travel
kept
even
our
active
restless
party
interested
one
of
our
number
played
guitar
accompaniments
and
we
sang
choruses
on
deck
at
night
forgetting
that
the
might
grate
on
the
ears
of
some
of
the
people
about
us
the
captain
and
steamer
crew
allowed
us
to
roam
up
and
down
the
boat
at
will
and
when
we
found
by
the
map
or
crew
that
we
were
about
to
touch
the
bank
in
a
hitherto
unvisited
state
we
were
the
first
to
run
over
the
and
caper
up
and
down
the
soil
to
add
a
new
state
to
our
list
of
those
in
which
we
had
been
we
rather
wondered
though
what
we
would
do
if
asked
questions
by
our
elders
at
home
as
to
what
we
thought
of
arkansas
mississippi
and
tennessee
as
we
had
only
scampered
on
and
off
the
river
bank
of
those
states
while
the
wooding
went
on
we
were
like
children
let
out
of
school
and
everything
interested
us
even
the
low
water
was
an
event
the
sudden
stop
of
our
great
steamer
which
large
as
it
was
drew
but
a
few
feet
of
water
made
the
timbers
groan
and
the
machinery
creak
then
we
took
ourselves
to
the
bow
where
the
captain
mate
and
were
preparing
for
a
siege
as
the
force
of
the
engines
had
ploughed
us
deep
into
a
there
was
wrenching
veering
and
struggling
of
the
huge
boat
and
at
last
a
resort
to
those
two
spars
which
seem
to
be
so
uselessly
attached
to
each
side
of
the
forward
deck
of
the
river
steamers
these
were
swung
out
and
plunged
into
the
bank
the
rope
and
tackle
put
into
use
and
with
the
aid
of
these
stilts
we
were
skipped
over
the
into
the
deeper
water
it
was
on
that
journey
that
i
first
heard
the
name
clemens
took
as
his
de
the
droning
voice
of
the
sailor
taking
soundings
as
we
slowly
crept
through
low
water
called
out
mark
twain
and
the
pilot
answered
by
steering
the
boat
according
to
the
story
of
the
the
trip
on
a
mississippi
steamer
as
we
knew
it
is
now
one
of
the
things
of
the
past
it
was
accounted
then
and
before
the
war
our
most
luxurious
mode
of
travel
every
one
was
sociable
and
in
the
constant
association
of
the
long
trip
some
warm
friendships
sprung
up
we
had
then
our
first
acquaintance
with
bostonians
as
well
as
with
southerners
of
course
it
was
too
soon
for
southern
women
robbed
of
home
and
even
the
necessities
of
life
by
the
cruelty
of
war
to
be
wholly
cordial
we
were
more
and
more
amazed
at
the
ignorance
in
the
south
concerning
the
north
a
young
girl
otherwise
intelligent
thawed
out
enough
to
confess
to
me
that
she
had
really
no
idea
that
yankee
soldiers
were
like
their
own
physically
she
imagined
they
would
be
as
widely
different
as
black
from
white
and
a
sort
of
combination
of
gorilla
and
chimpanzee
gunboats
had
but
a
short
time
before
moored
at
the
levee
that
bounded
her
grandmother
plantation
and
the
negroes
ran
into
the
house
crying
the
terrible
news
of
the
approach
of
the
enemy
the
very
thought
of
a
yankee
was
abhorrent
but
the
girl
more
absorbed
with
curiosity
than
fear
slipped
out
of
the
house
to
where
a
view
of
the
walk
from
the
landing
was
to
be
had
and
seeing
a
naval
officer
approaching
raced
back
to
her
grandmother
crying
out
in
surprise
at
finding
a
being
like
unto
her
own
people
why
it
a
man
as
we
approached
new
orleans
the
plantations
grew
richer
the
palmetto
and
the
orange
by
which
we
are
twice
blessed
in
its
simultaneous
blossom
and
fruit
the
oleander
treasured
in
conservatories
at
home
here
growing
to
tree
size
along
the
country
roads
all
charmed
us
the
wide
galleries
around
the
two
stories
of
the
houses
were
a
delight
the
course
of
our
boat
was
often
near
enough
the
shore
for
us
to
see
the
family
gathered
around
the
spread
on
the
upper
gallery
which
was
protected
from
the
sun
by
blinds
or
shades
of
matting
we
left
the
steamer
at
new
orleans
with
regret
it
seems
even
now
that
it
is
rather
too
bad
we
have
grown
into
so
hurried
a
race
that
we
can
not
spare
the
time
to
travel
as
leisurely
or
luxuriously
as
we
did
then
even
going
off
for
a
tour
when
they
are
not
restricted
by
time
nor
mode
of
journeying
study
the
closely
to
see
by
which
route
the
quickest
passage
can
be
made
chapter
ii
new
orleans
after
the
war
we
were
detained
by
orders
for
a
little
time
in
new
orleans
and
the
general
was
enthusiastic
over
the
city
all
day
we
strolled
through
the
streets
visiting
the
french
quarter
contrasting
the
foreign
shopkeepers
who
were
never
too
hurried
to
be
polite
with
our
brusque
northern
clerk
dined
in
the
charming
french
restaurants
where
we
saw
eating
made
a
fine
art
the
was
then
new
to
me
and
i
hovered
over
the
crabs
lobsters
and
shrimps
but
remember
how
amused
the
general
was
by
my
quick
retreat
from
a
huge
live
green
turtle
whose
locomotion
was
suspended
by
his
being
turned
upon
his
back
he
was
unconsciously
bearing
his
own
epitaph
fastened
upon
his
shell
i
will
be
served
up
for
dinner
at
we
of
course
spent
hours
even
matutinal
hours
at
the
market
and
the
general
drank
so
much
coffee
that
the
old
mammy
who
served
him
said
many
a
mon
dieu
in
surprise
at
his
capacity
and
volubly
described
in
french
to
her
neighbors
what
marvels
a
yankee
man
could
do
in
for
years
after
when
very
good
coffee
was
praised
or
even
eliza
strongly
commended
his
plus
was
almost
equal
to
the
french
market
we
here
learned
what
artistic
effects
could
be
produced
with
prosaic
carrots
beets
onions
and
turnips
the
general
looked
with
wonder
upon
the
leisurely
creole
grandee
who
came
to
order
his
own
dinner
after
his
epicurean
selection
he
showed
the
interest
and
skill
that
a
northern
man
might
in
the
buying
of
a
picture
or
a
horse
when
the
servant
bearing
the
basket
was
entrusted
with
what
was
to
be
enjoyed
at
night
we
had
never
known
men
that
took
time
to
market
except
as
our
hurried
northern
fathers
of
families
sometimes
made
sudden
raids
upon
the
butcher
on
the
way
to
business
and
called
off
an
order
as
they
ran
for
a
car
the
canal
street
with
its
throng
of
leisurely
promenaders
was
our
daily
resort
the
stands
of
parma
violets
on
the
street
corners
perfumed
the
whole
block
and
the
war
seemed
not
even
to
have
cast
a
cloud
over
the
first
foreign
people
we
had
seen
the
general
was
so
pleased
with
the
picturesque
costumes
of
the
servants
that
eliza
was
put
into
a
turban
at
his
entreaty
in
vain
we
tried
for
a
glimpse
of
the
creole
beauties
the
duenna
that
guarded
them
in
their
rare
promenades
as
they
glided
by
wearing
gracefully
the
lace
mantilla
bonnetless
and
shaded
by
a
french
parasol
whisked
the
pretty
things
out
of
sight
quick
as
we
were
to
discover
and
respectfully
follow
them
the
effects
of
general
butler
reign
were
still
visible
in
the
marvelous
cleanliness
of
the
city
we
drove
on
the
shell
road
spent
hours
in
the
went
to
the
theatres
and
even
penetrated
the
rooms
of
the
most
exclusive
milliners
for
general
custer
liked
the
shops
as
much
as
i
did
indeed
we
had
a
grand
and
were
not
in
the
least
troubled
at
our
detention
general
scott
was
then
in
our
hotel
about
to
set
out
for
the
north
he
remembered
lieutenant
custer
who
had
reported
to
him
in
and
was
the
bearer
of
despatches
sent
by
him
to
the
front
and
he
congratulated
my
husband
on
his
career
in
terms
that
coming
from
such
a
veteran
made
his
leap
for
joy
general
scott
was
then
very
infirm
and
expressing
a
wish
to
see
me
with
gallantry
begged
my
husband
to
explain
to
me
that
he
would
be
compelled
to
claim
the
privilege
of
sitting
but
it
was
too
much
for
his
etiquettical
instincts
and
weak
as
he
was
he
feebly
drew
his
tall
form
to
a
position
leaning
against
the
lounge
as
i
entered
pictures
of
general
scott
in
my
father
home
belonged
to
my
earliest
recollections
he
was
a
colossal
figure
on
a
fiery
steed
whose
prancing
forefeet
never
touched
the
earth
the
mexican
war
had
hung
a
halo
about
him
and
my
childish
explanation
of
the
clouds
of
dust
that
the
artist
sought
to
represent
was
the
smoke
of
battle
in
which
i
supposed
the
hero
lived
perpetually
and
now
this
decrepit
tottering
man
i
was
almost
sorry
to
have
seen
him
at
all
except
for
the
praise
that
he
bestowed
upon
my
husband
which
coming
from
so
old
a
soldier
i
deeply
appreciated
general
sheridan
had
assumed
command
of
the
department
of
the
mississippi
and
the
government
had
hired
a
beautiful
mansion
for
headquarters
where
he
was
at
last
living
handsomely
after
all
his
rough
campaigning
when
we
dined
with
him
we
could
but
contrast
the
food
prepared
over
a
virginia
with
the
dainty
french
cookery
of
the
old
colored
mary
who
served
him
afterward
so
many
years
general
custer
was
of
course
glad
to
be
under
his
chief
again
and
after
dinner
while
i
was
given
over
to
some
of
the
military
family
to
entertain
the
two
men
sitting
on
the
wide
gallery
talked
of
what
it
was
then
believed
would
be
a
campaign
across
the
border
i
was
left
in
complete
ignorance
and
did
not
even
know
that
an
army
of
men
was
being
organized
under
general
sheridan
masterly
hand
my
husband
read
the
eastern
papers
to
me
and
took
the
liberty
of
reserving
such
articles
as
might
prove
incendiary
in
his
family
if
our
incorrigible
scamp
spoke
of
the
expected
wealth
he
intended
to
acquire
from
the
sacking
of
palaces
and
the
spoils
of
churches
he
was
frowned
upon
not
only
because
the
general
tried
to
teach
him
that
there
were
some
subjects
too
sacred
to
be
touched
by
his
irreverent
tongue
but
because
he
did
not
wish
my
anxieties
to
be
aroused
by
the
prospect
of
another
campaign
as
much
of
my
story
must
be
of
the
hardships
my
husband
endured
i
have
here
lingered
a
little
over
the
holiday
that
our
journey
and
the
detention
in
new
orleans
gave
him
i
hardly
think
any
one
can
recall
a
complaint
of
his
in
those
fourteen
years
of
but
he
was
taught
through
deprivations
how
to
enjoy
every
moment
of
such
days
as
that
charming
journey
and
city
experience
gave
us
the
steamer
chartered
to
take
troops
up
the
red
river
was
finally
ready
and
we
sailed
the
last
week
in
june
there
were
horses
and
government
freight
on
board
the
captain
was
well
named
greathouse
as
he
greeted
us
with
hospitality
and
put
his
little
steamer
at
our
disposal
besides
the
fact
that
this
contract
for
transportation
would
line
his
pockets
well
he
really
seemed
glad
to
have
us
he
was
a
yankee
and
gave
us
his
native
state
indiana
in
copious
and
inexhaustible
supplies
as
his
contribution
to
the
talks
on
deck
long
residence
in
the
south
had
not
dimmed
his
patriotism
and
in
the
rapid
transits
from
deck
to
of
this
tall
hoosier
i
almost
saw
the
straps
fastening
down
the
trousers
of
brother
jonathan
as
well
as
the
cut
from
the
american
flag
so
entirely
did
he
personate
in
his
figure
our
emblematic
uncle
sam
it
is
customary
for
the
government
to
defray
the
expenses
of
officers
and
soldiers
when
traveling
under
orders
but
so
much
is
involved
that
they
often
pay
their
own
way
at
the
time
and
the
quartermaster
reimburses
them
at
the
journey
end
the
captain
knew
this
and
thought
he
would
give
himself
the
pleasure
of
having
us
as
his
guests
accordingly
he
took
the
general
one
side
and
imparted
this
very
pleasing
information
even
with
the
provident
ones
this
would
be
a
relief
while
we
had
come
on
board
almost
wrecked
in
our
finances
by
the
theatre
the
tempting
flowers
the
fascinating
restaurants
and
finally
a
disastrous
lingering
one
day
in
the
beguiling
shop
of
madam
olympe
the
reigning
milliner
the
general
had
bought
some
folly
for
me
in
spite
of
the
heroic
protest
that
i
made
about
its
inappropriateness
for
texas
and
it
left
us
just
enough
to
pay
for
our
food
on
our
journey
provided
we
ordered
nothing
extra
and
had
no
delays
captain
greathouse
little
knew
to
what
paupers
he
was
extending
his
hospitality
no
one
can
comprehend
how
carelessly
and
enjoyably
army
people
can
walk
about
with
empty
pockets
knowing
that
it
is
but
a
matter
of
thirty
days
waiting
till
richard
shall
be
himself
again
my
husband
made
haste
to
impart
the
news
quietly
to
the
staff
that
the
captain
was
going
to
invite
them
all
to
be
his
guests
and
so
relieve
their
anxiety
about
financial
embarrassment
the
scamp
saw
a
chance
for
a
joke
and
when
the
captain
again
appeared
he
knew
that
he
was
going
to
receive
the
invitation
and
anticipated
it
in
our
presence
he
jingled
the
last
cents
he
had
in
the
world
against
the
knife
in
his
almost
empty
pockets
assumed
a
air
and
begged
to
know
the
cost
of
the
journey
as
he
loftily
said
he
made
it
a
rule
always
to
pay
in
advance
at
this
the
general
unable
to
smother
his
laughter
precipitated
himself
out
of
the
nearly
over
the
narrow
guard
to
avoid
having
his
merriment
seen
when
the
captain
said
blandly
that
he
was
about
to
invite
our
party
to
partake
of
his
hospitality
our
scamp
bowed
and
accepted
the
courtesy
as
if
it
were
condescension
on
his
part
and
proceeded
to
take
possession
and
almost
command
of
the
steamer
it
was
a
curious
trip
that
journey
up
the
red
river
we
saw
the
dull
water
from
the
clay
bed
and
banks
mingling
with
the
clearer
current
of
the
mississippi
long
before
we
entered
the
mouth
of
the
red
river
we
had
a
delightful
journey
but
i
do
know
why
except
that
youth
health
and
buoyant
spirits
rise
superior
to
everything
the
river
was
ugliness
itself
the
tree
trunks
far
up
were
gray
and
slimy
with
the
late
freshet
the
hanging
moss
adding
a
dismal
feature
to
the
scene
the
waters
still
covered
the
low
muddy
banks
strewn
with
fallen
trees
and
underbrush
the
river
was
very
narrow
in
places
and
in
our
way
there
were
precursors
of
the
red
river
raft
above
at
one
time
before
government
work
was
begun
the
raft
extended
miles
beyond
shreveport
and
closed
the
channel
to
steamers
sometimes
the
pilot
wound
us
round
just
such
obstructions
logs
and
driftwood
jammed
in
so
firmly
and
so
immovable
they
looked
like
solid
ground
while
rank
vegetation
sprung
up
through
the
thick
moss
that
covered
the
decaying
tree
trunks
the
river
was
very
crooked
the
whistle
screeched
when
approaching
a
turn
but
so
sudden
were
some
of
these
that
a
steamer
coming
down
not
slackening
speed
almost
ran
into
us
at
one
sharp
bend
it
shaved
our
sides
and
set
our
boat
while
the
vituperations
of
the
boat
crew
and
the
loud
angry
voices
of
the
captain
and
pilot
with
a
prompt
return
of
such
civilities
from
the
other
steamer
made
us
aware
that
emergencies
brought
forth
a
special
and
extensive
set
of
invectives
reserved
for
careless
navigation
on
the
red
river
of
the
south
we
grew
to
have
an
increasing
respect
for
the
skill
of
the
pilot
as
he
steered
us
around
sharp
turns
across
low
water
filled
with
branching
upturned
tree
trunks
and
skillfully
took
a
narrow
path
between
the
shore
and
a
snag
that
menacingly
ran
its
black
point
out
of
the
water
a
steamer
in
advance
of
us
carrying
troops
had
encountered
a
snag
while
going
at
great
speed
and
the
obstructing
tree
ran
entirely
through
the
boat
coming
out
at
the
the
troops
were
unloaded
and
taken
up
afterward
by
another
steamer
sometimes
the
roots
of
great
forest
trees
swept
down
by
a
freshet
become
imbedded
in
the
river
and
the
whole
length
of
the
trunk
is
under
water
swaying
up
and
down
but
not
visible
below
the
turbid
surface
the
forest
is
dense
at
some
points
and
we
could
see
but
a
short
distance
as
we
made
our
circuitous
dangerous
way
the
and
the
soft
red
clay
of
the
were
a
fitting
home
for
the
alligators
that
lay
sunning
themselves
or
sluggishly
crawled
into
the
stream
as
the
general
aimed
at
them
with
his
rifle
from
the
steamer
guards
they
were
new
game
and
gave
some
fresh
excitement
to
the
long
idle
days
he
never
gave
up
trying
in
his
determined
way
for
the
vulnerable
spot
in
their
hide
just
behind
the
eye
i
thought
the
crane
must
have
first
acquired
its
tiresome
habit
of
standing
on
one
leg
from
its
disgust
at
letting
down
the
reserve
foot
into
such
thick
noisome
water
it
seemed
a
pity
that
some
of
those
shots
from
the
steamer
deck
had
not
ended
its
melancholy
existence
through
all
this
mournful
the
guitar
twanged
and
the
dense
forest
resounded
to
war
choruses
or
old
college
glees
that
we
sent
out
in
happy
notes
as
we
sat
on
deck
i
believe
captain
greathouse
bade
us
with
regret
as
he
seemed
to
enjoy
the
jolly
party
and
when
we
landed
at
alexandria
he
gave
us
a
hogshead
of
ice
the
last
we
were
to
see
for
a
year
a
house
abandoned
by
its
owners
and
used
by
general
banks
for
headquarters
during
the
war
was
selected
for
our
temporary
home
as
we
stepped
upon
the
levee
a
tall
southerner
came
toward
me
and
extended
his
hand
at
that
time
the
citizens
were
not
wont
to
welcome
the
yankee
in
that
manner
he
had
to
tell
me
who
he
was
as
unfortunately
i
had
forgotten
and
i
began
to
realize
the
truth
of
the
saying
that
there
are
but
two
hundred
and
fifty
people
in
the
world
when
i
found
an
acquaintance
in
this
isolated
town
he
proved
to
be
the
only
southerner
i
had
ever
known
in
my
native
town
in
michigan
who
came
there
when
a
lad
to
visit
kinsfolk
in
those
days
his
long
black
hair
large
dark
eyes
and
languishing
manner
added
to
the
smooth
flattering
speeches
made
sad
havoc
in
our
ranks
i
suppose
the
youthful
and
probably
susceptible
hearts
of
our
circle
were
all
set
fluttering
for
the
boy
seemed
to
find
pleasure
in
a
chat
with
any
one
of
us
that
fell
to
him
in
our
walks
to
and
from
school
the
captivating
part
of
it
all
was
the
lines
written
on
the
pages
of
my
arithmetic
otherwise
so
odious
to
me
come
with
me
to
my
distant
home
where
under
soft
southern
skies
we
breathe
the
odor
of
orange
groves
none
of
us
had
answered
to
his
come
possibly
because
of
the
infantile
state
of
our
existence
possibly
because
the
invitation
was
too
general
and
here
stood
our
youthful
hero
worn
prematurely
old
and
shabby
after
his
four
years
of
fighting
for
the
cause
the
boasted
halls
of
his
ancestors
the
same
to
which
we
had
been
so
ardently
invited
were
a
plain
white
cottage
no
orange
groves
but
a
few
sparsely
scattered
over
the
prescribed
lawn
in
the
pleasant
visit
that
we
all
had
there
was
discreet
avoidance
of
the
poetic
license
he
had
taken
in
early
years
when
describing
his
home
under
the
southern
sky
alexandria
had
been
partly
burned
during
the
war
and
was
built
up
mostly
with
cottages
indeed
it
was
always
the
popular
mode
of
building
there
we
found
everything
a
hundred
years
behind
the
times
the
houses
of
our
mechanics
at
home
had
more
conveniences
and
modern
improvements
i
suppose
the
retinue
of
servants
before
the
war
rendered
the
inhabitants
indifferent
to
what
we
think
absolutely
necessary
for
comfort
the
house
we
used
as
headquarters
had
large
lofty
rooms
separated
by
a
wide
hall
while
in
addition
there
were
two
wings
a
family
occupied
of
the
house
caring
for
it
in
the
absence
of
the
owners
in
the
six
weeks
we
were
there
we
never
saw
them
and
naturally
concluded
they
were
not
filled
with
joy
at
our
presence
the
house
was
delightfully
airy
but
we
took
up
the
southern
custom
of
living
on
the
gallery
the
library
was
still
intact
in
spite
of
its
having
been
headquarters
for
our
army
and
evidently
the
people
had
lived
in
what
was
considered
luxury
for
the
south
in
its
former
days
yet
everything
was
primitive
enough
this
great
house
filled
as
it
once
was
with
servants
had
its
sole
water
supply
from
two
tanks
or
cisterns
above
ground
at
the
rear
the
rich
and
the
poor
were
alike
dependent
upon
these
receptacles
for
water
and
it
was
not
a
result
of
the
war
for
this
was
the
only
kind
of
reservoir
provided
even
in
prosperous
times
but
one
well
was
dug
in
alexandria
as
the
water
was
brackish
and
impure
each
house
no
matter
how
small
had
cisterns
sometimes
as
high
as
the
smaller
cottages
themselves
the
water
in
those
where
we
lived
was
very
low
the
tops
were
uncovered
and
dust
leaves
bugs
and
flies
were
blown
in
while
the
cats
strolled
around
the
upper
rim
during
their
midnight
orchestral
overtures
we
found
it
necessary
to
husband
the
fast
lowering
water
as
the
rains
were
over
for
the
summer
the
servants
were
enjoined
to
draw
out
the
plug
there
was
not
even
a
yankee
faucet
with
the
utmost
care
while
some
one
was
to
keep
vigilant
watch
on
a
cow
very
advanced
in
cunning
that
used
to
come
and
hook
at
the
plug
till
it
was
loosened
and
fell
out
the
sound
of
flowing
water
was
our
first
warning
of
the
precious
wasting
no
one
could
drink
the
and
even
in
our
ablutions
we
turned
our
eyes
away
as
we
poured
the
water
from
the
pitcher
into
the
bowl
our
was
so
full
of
gallinippers
and
pollywogs
that
a
glass
stood
by
the
plate
untouched
until
the
sediment
and
natural
history
united
at
the
bottom
while
heaven
knows
what
a
microscope
had
we
possessed
one
would
have
revealed
eliza
was
well
primed
with
stories
of
alligators
by
the
negroes
and
soldiers
who
loved
to
frighten
her
one
measuring
thirteen
feet
eight
inches
was
killed
on
the
they
said
as
he
was
about
to
partake
of
his
favorite
supper
a
negro
sleeping
on
the
sand
it
was
enough
for
eliza
when
she
heard
of
this
preference
for
those
of
her
color
and
she
duly
stampeded
she
was
not
well
up
in
the
habits
of
animals
and
having
seen
the
alligators
crawling
over
the
mud
of
the
river
banks
she
believed
they
were
so
constituted
that
at
night
they
could
take
long
tramps
over
the
country
she
used
to
assure
me
that
she
nightly
heard
them
crawling
around
the
house
one
night
when
some
fearful
sounds
issued
from
the
cavernous
depths
of
the
old
cistern
she
ran
to
one
of
the
old
negroes
of
the
place
her
carefully
braided
wool
rising
from
her
head
in
consternation
and
called
out
jest
listen
jest
listen
the
old
mammy
quieted
her
by
oh
la
honey
do
you
be
skeart
nothin
goin
to
hurt
you
them
only
this
information
though
it
quieted
eliza
fears
did
not
make
the
any
more
enjoyable
to
us
the
houses
along
red
river
were
raised
from
the
ground
on
piles
as
the
soil
was
too
soft
and
porous
for
cellars
before
the
fences
were
destroyed
and
the
place
fell
into
dilapidation
there
might
have
been
a
lattice
around
the
base
of
the
building
but
now
it
was
gone
though
this
open
space
under
the
house
gave
vent
for
what
air
was
stirring
it
also
offered
free
circulation
to
pigs
that
ran
grunting
and
squealing
back
and
forth
and
even
the
calves
sought
its
grateful
shelter
from
the
sun
and
flies
and
oh
the
mosquitoes
others
have
exhausted
adjectives
in
trying
to
describe
them
and
until
i
came
to
know
those
of
the
missouri
river
at
fort
lincoln
dakota
i
joined
in
the
general
testimony
that
the
red
river
of
the
south
could
not
be
outdone
the
bayous
about
us
filled
with
decaying
vegetable
matter
and
surrounded
with
marshy
ground
and
the
frequent
rapid
fall
of
the
river
leaving
banks
of
mud
all
bred
mosquitoes
or
gallinippers
as
the
darkies
called
them
eliza
took
counsel
as
to
the
best
mode
of
extermination
and
brought
old
kettles
with
raw
cotton
into
our
room
from
which
proceeded
such
smudges
and
such
odors
as
would
soon
have
wilted
a
northern
mosquito
but
it
only
resulted
in
making
us
feel
like
a
piece
of
dried
meat
hanging
in
a
while
the
undisturbed
insect
winged
its
way
about
our
heads
singing
as
it
swirled
and
dipped
and
plunged
its
javelin
into
our
defenseless
flesh
there
were
days
there
as
at
fort
lincoln
when
the
wind
blowing
in
a
certain
direction
brought
such
myriads
of
them
that
i
was
obliged
to
beat
a
retreat
under
the
netting
that
enveloped
the
high
broad
bed
which
is
a
specialty
of
the
extreme
south
and
with
my
book
writing
or
sewing
listened
triumphantly
to
the
clamoring
army
beating
on
the
outside
of
the
bars
the
general
made
fun
of
me
thus
enthroned
when
he
returned
from
office
work
but
i
used
to
reply
that
he
could
afford
to
remain
unprotected
if
the
greedy
creatures
could
draw
their
sustenance
from
his
veins
without
leaving
a
sting
at
the
rear
of
our
house
were
two
rows
of
negro
quarters
which
eliza
soon
penetrated
and
afterward
begged
me
to
visit
only
the
very
old
and
worthless
servants
remained
the
owners
of
the
place
on
which
we
were
living
had
three
other
sugar
plantations
in
the
valley
from
one
of
which
alone
hogsheads
of
sugar
were
shipped
in
one
season
and
at
the
approach
of
the
army
negroes
were
sent
into
texas
eliza
described
the
decamping
of
the
owner
of
the
plantation
thus
oh
miss
libbie
the
war
made
a
mighty
scatter
the
poor
creatures
left
were
in
desperate
straits
one
a
woman
having
been
a
was
intelligent
for
one
of
her
race
after
eliza
had
taken
me
the
rounds
i
piloted
the
general
and
he
found
that
though
the
very
old
woman
did
not
know
her
exact
age
she
could
tell
him
of
events
that
she
remembered
when
she
was
in
new
orleans
with
her
mistress
which
enabled
him
to
calculate
her
years
to
be
almost
a
hundred
three
old
people
claimed
to
remember
washington
war
i
look
back
to
our
visit
to
her
little
cabin
where
we
sat
beside
her
bed
as
one
of
vivid
interest
the
old
woman
knew
little
of
the
war
and
no
one
had
told
her
of
the
proclamation
until
our
arrival
we
were
both
much
moved
when
after
asking
us
questions
she
said
to
me
and
missey
is
it
really
true
that
i
is
free
then
she
raised
her
eyes
to
heaven
and
blessed
the
lord
for
letting
her
live
to
see
the
day
the
general
who
had
to
expostulate
with
eliza
sometimes
for
her
habit
of
feeding
every
one
out
of
our
supplies
whether
needy
or
not
had
no
word
to
say
now
our
kitchen
could
be
full
of
grizzly
tottering
old
wrecks
and
he
only
smiled
on
the
generous
dispenser
of
her
master
substance
indeed
he
had
them
fed
all
the
time
we
stayed
there
and
they
dragged
their
tattered
caps
from
their
old
heads
and
blessed
him
as
we
left
for
what
he
had
done
and
for
the
food
that
he
provided
for
them
after
we
were
gone
it
was
at
alexandria
that
i
first
visited
a
negro
as
we
sat
on
the
gallery
one
evening
we
heard
the
shouting
and
singing
and
quietly
crept
round
to
the
cabin
where
the
exhorting
and
groaning
were
going
on
my
husband
stood
with
uncovered
head
reverencing
their
sincerity
and
not
a
muscle
of
his
face
moved
though
it
was
rather
difficult
to
keep
back
a
smile
at
the
grotesqueness
of
the
scene
the
language
and
the
absorbed
manner
in
which
these
old
slaves
held
communion
with
their
lord
as
if
he
were
there
in
person
and
told
him
in
simple
but
powerful
language
their
thanks
that
the
day
of
jubilee
had
come
that
their
lives
had
been
spared
to
see
freedom
come
to
his
people
made
us
sure
that
a
faith
that
brought
their
saviour
down
in
their
midst
was
superior
to
that
of
the
more
civilized
who
send
petitions
to
a
throne
that
they
themselves
surround
with
clouds
of
doctrine
and
doubt
though
they
were
so
poor
and
helpless
and
seemingly
without
anything
to
inspire
gratitude
evidently
there
were
reasons
in
their
own
minds
for
heartfelt
thanks
as
there
was
no
mistaking
the
genuineness
of
feeling
when
they
sang
bless
the
lord
that
i
can
rise
and
tell
that
jesus
has
done
all
things
well
old
as
some
of
these
people
were
their
religion
took
a
very
energetic
form
they
swayed
back
and
forth
as
they
sat
about
the
dimly
lighted
cabin
clapped
their
hands
spasmodically
and
raised
their
eyes
to
heaven
in
moments
of
absorption
there
were
those
among
the
younger
people
who
jumped
up
and
down
as
the
power
possessed
them
and
the
very
feeblest
uttered
groans
and
quavered
out
the
chorus
of
the
old
tunes
in
place
of
the
more
active
demonstrations
for
which
their
rheumatic
old
limbs
now
unfitted
them
when
afterward
my
husband
read
to
me
newspaper
accounts
of
negro
or
graphically
written
no
description
seemed
exaggerated
to
us
and
he
used
to
say
that
nothing
compared
with
that
night
when
we
first
listened
to
those
serious
earnest
old
centenarians
whose
feeble
voices
still
quavered
out
a
tune
of
gratitude
as
with
bent
forms
and
bowed
heads
they
stood
leaning
on
their
canes
and
crutches
as
the
heat
became
more
overpowering
i
began
to
make
excuses
for
the
manner
of
living
of
the
red
river
people
active
as
was
my
temperament
climatic
influences
told
and
i
felt
that
i
should
have
merited
the
denunciation
of
the
antique
woman
in
uncle
tom
cabin
of
heow
shiftless
it
was
hard
to
move
about
in
the
heat
of
the
day
but
at
evening
we
all
went
for
a
ride
it
seemed
to
me
a
land
of
enchantment
we
had
never
known
such
luxuriance
of
vegetation
the
valley
of
the
river
extended
several
miles
inland
the
foliage
was
varied
and
abundant
and
the
sunsets
had
deeper
richer
colors
than
any
at
the
north
the
general
getting
such
constant
pleasure
out
of
nature
and
not
in
the
least
minding
to
express
it
was
glad
to
hear
even
the
prosaic
one
of
our
number
who
rarely
cared
for
color
or
scenery
go
into
raptures
over
the
gorgeous
orange
and
red
of
that
southern
sky
we
sometimes
rode
for
miles
along
the
country
roads
between
hedges
of
on
one
side
and
a
double
white
rose
on
the
other
growing
fifteen
feet
high
the
dew
enhanced
the
fragrance
and
a
lavish
profusion
was
displayed
by
nature
in
that
valley
which
was
a
constant
delight
to
us
sometimes
my
husband
and
i
remained
out
very
late
loth
to
come
back
to
the
prosy
uninteresting
town
with
its
streets
flecked
with
bits
of
cotton
evidences
of
the
traffic
of
the
world
as
the
levee
was
now
piled
up
with
bales
ready
for
shipment
once
the
staff
crossed
with
us
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
rode
out
through
more
beautiful
country
roads
to
what
was
still
called
sherman
institute
general
sherman
had
been
at
the
head
of
this
military
school
before
the
war
but
it
was
subsequently
converted
into
a
hospital
it
was
in
a
lonely
and
deserted
district
and
the
great
empty
stone
building
with
its
turreted
corners
and
modern
architecture
seemed
utterly
incongruous
in
the
wild
pine
forest
that
surrounded
it
we
returned
to
the
river
and
visited
two
forts
on
the
bank
opposite
alexandria
they
were
built
by
a
confederate
officer
who
used
his
federal
prisoners
for
workmen
the
general
took
in
at
once
the
admirable
situation
selected
which
commanded
the
river
for
many
miles
he
thoroughly
appreciated
and
endeavored
carefully
to
explain
to
me
how
cleverly
the
few
materials
at
the
disposal
of
the
impoverished
south
had
been
utilized
the
moat
about
the
forts
was
the
deepest
our
officers
had
ever
seen
closely
as
my
husband
studied
the
plan
and
formation
he
said
it
would
have
added
greatly
to
his
appreciation
had
he
then
known
what
he
afterward
learned
that
the
confederate
engineer
who
planned
this
admirable
fortification
was
one
of
his
classmates
at
west
point
of
whom
he
was
very
fond
in
an
immense
expedition
of
our
forces
was
sent
up
the
red
river
to
capture
shreveport
and
open
up
the
great
cotton
districts
of
texas
it
was
unsuccessful
and
the
retreat
was
rendered
impossible
by
low
water
while
much
damage
was
done
to
our
fleet
by
the
very
confederate
forts
we
were
now
visiting
a
dam
was
constructed
near
alexandria
and
the
squadron
was
saved
from
capture
or
annihilation
by
this
timely
conception
of
a
western
man
colonel
joseph
bailey
the
dam
was
visible
from
the
walls
of
the
forts
where
we
climbed
for
a
view
as
we
resumed
our
ride
to
the
steamer
the
general
who
was
usually
an
admirable
pathfinder
proposed
a
new
and
shorter
road
and
liking
variety
too
much
to
wish
to
travel
the
same
country
twice
over
all
gladly
assented
everything
went
very
well
for
a
time
we
were
absorbed
in
talking
noting
new
scenes
on
the
route
or
as
was
our
custom
when
riding
off
from
the
public
highway
we
sang
some
chorus
and
thus
laughing
singing
joking
we
galloped
over
the
ground
thoughtlessly
into
the
very
midst
of
serious
danger
apparently
nothing
before
us
impeded
our
way
we
knew
very
little
of
the
nature
of
the
soil
in
that
country
but
had
become
somewhat
accustomed
to
the
bayous
that
either
start
from
the
river
or
appear
suddenly
inland
quite
disconnected
from
any
stream
on
that
day
we
dashed
heedlessly
to
the
bank
of
a
wide
bayou
that
poured
its
waters
into
the
red
river
instead
of
thinking
twice
and
taking
the
precaution
to
follow
its
course
farther
up
into
the
country
where
the
mud
was
dryer
and
the
space
to
cross
much
narrower
we
determined
not
to
delay
and
prepared
to
go
over
the
most
venturesome
dashed
first
on
to
this
bit
of
dried
slough
and
though
the
crust
swayed
and
sunk
under
the
horses
flying
feet
it
still
seemed
caked
hard
enough
to
bear
every
weight
there
were
seams
and
fissures
in
portions
of
the
bayou
through
which
the
moist
mud
oozed
but
these
were
not
sufficient
warning
to
impetuous
people
another
and
another
sprang
over
the
undulating
soil
having
reached
the
other
side
they
rode
up
and
down
the
opposite
bank
shouting
to
us
where
they
thought
it
the
safest
to
cross
and
of
course
interlarded
their
directions
with
scoffing
about
hesitation
timidity
and
so
on
the
general
never
second
in
anything
when
he
could
help
it
remained
behind
to
fortify
my
sinking
heart
and
urge
me
to
undertake
the
crossing
with
him
he
reminded
me
how
carefully
custis
lee
had
learned
to
follow
and
to
trust
to
him
and
he
would
doubtless
plant
his
hoofs
in
the
very
tracks
of
his
own
horse
another
of
our
party
tried
to
bolster
up
my
courage
assuring
me
that
if
the
heavy
one
among
us
was
safely
on
the
other
bank
my
light
weight
might
be
trusted
i
dreaded
making
the
party
wait
until
we
had
gone
further
up
the
bayou
and
might
have
mustered
up
the
required
pluck
had
i
not
met
with
trepidation
on
the
part
of
my
horse
his
fine
delicate
ears
told
me
as
plainly
as
if
he
could
speak
that
i
was
asking
a
great
deal
of
him
we
had
encountered
quicksands
together
in
the
bed
of
a
virginia
stream
and
both
horse
and
rider
were
recalling
the
fearful
sensation
when
the
animal
hindlegs
sank
leaving
his
body
engulfed
in
the
soil
with
powerful
struggles
with
his
forefeet
and
muscular
shoulders
we
plunged
to
the
right
and
left
and
found
at
last
firm
soil
on
which
to
escape
with
such
a
recollection
still
fresh
as
memory
is
sure
to
retain
terrors
like
that
it
was
hardly
a
wonder
that
we
shrank
from
the
next
step
his
trembling
flanks
shook
as
much
as
the
unsteady
hand
that
held
his
bridle
he
quivered
from
head
to
foot
and
held
back
i
urged
and
patted
his
neck
while
we
both
continued
to
shiver
on
the
brink
the
general
laughed
at
the
two
cowards
we
really
were
but
still
gave
us
time
to
get
our
courage
up
to
the
mark
the
officer
remaining
with
us
continued
to
encourage
me
with
assurances
that
there
was
not
an
atom
of
danger
and
finally
with
a
bound
shouting
out
look
how
well
i
shall
go
over
sprang
upon
the
vibrating
crust
in
an
instant
with
a
crack
like
a
pistol
the
thin
layer
of
solid
mud
broke
and
down
went
the
gay
handsomely
caparisoned
fellow
engulfed
to
his
waist
in
the
foul
black
crust
there
was
at
once
a
commotion
with
no
ropes
it
was
hard
to
effect
his
release
his
horse
helped
him
most
struggling
frantically
for
the
bank
while
the
officers
having
flung
themselves
off
from
their
animals
to
rush
to
his
rescue
brought
poles
and
tree
branches
which
the
imbedded
man
was
not
slow
to
grasp
and
drag
himself
from
the
perilous
spot
when
only
superhuman
strength
could
deliver
him
as
the
mud
of
a
bayou
sucks
under
its
surface
with
great
rapidity
anything
with
which
it
comes
in
contact
as
soon
as
the
officer
was
dragged
safely
on
to
firm
earth
a
shout
went
up
that
rent
the
air
with
its
merriment
scarcely
any
one
spoke
while
they
labored
to
save
the
man
life
but
once
he
was
out
of
peril
the
rescuers
felt
their
hour
had
come
they
called
out
to
him
in
tones
of
derision
the
vaunting
air
with
which
he
said
just
before
his
engulfment
look
at
me
see
how
i
go
over
he
was
indeed
a
sorry
sight
plastered
from
head
to
foot
with
black
mud
frightened
as
i
was
for
the
trembling
had
advanced
to
shivering
and
my
chattering
teeth
and
breathless
voice
were
past
my
control
i
still
felt
that
little
internal
tremor
of
laughter
that
somehow
pervades
one
who
has
a
sense
of
the
ludicrous
in
very
dangerous
surroundings
i
had
certainly
made
a
very
narrow
escape
for
it
would
have
been
doubly
hard
to
extricate
me
the
riding
habits
in
those
days
were
very
long
and
loaded
so
with
lead
to
keep
them
down
in
high
winds
and
i
may
add
in
furious
riding
that
it
was
about
all
i
could
do
to
lift
my
skirt
when
i
put
it
on
i
held
my
horse
with
a
snaffle
to
get
good
smooth
going
out
of
him
and
my
wrists
became
pretty
strong
but
in
that
slough
i
would
have
found
them
of
little
avail
i
fear
there
remained
no
opposition
to
seeking
a
narrower
part
of
the
bayou
above
where
i
had
made
such
an
escape
and
there
was
still
another
good
result
of
this
severe
lesson
after
that
when
we
came
to
such
soil
custis
lee
and
his
mistress
were
allowed
all
the
shivering
on
the
brink
that
their
cowardice
produced
while
the
party
scattered
to
investigate
the
sort
of
foundation
we
were
likely
to
find
before
we
attempted
to
plunge
over
a
louisiana
quagmire
the
bayous
were
a
strange
feature
of
that
country
often
without
inlet
or
outlet
a
strip
of
water
appeared
black
and
sluggish
filled
with
logs
snags
masses
of
underbrush
and
leaves
the
banks
covered
with
weeds
noisome
plants
and
rank
tangled
vegetation
seemed
the
dankest
darkest
most
weird
and
mournful
spots
imaginable
a
fit
home
for
ghouls
and
bogies
there
could
be
no
more
appropriate
place
for
a
sensational
novelist
to
locate
a
murder
after
a
time
i
became
accustomed
to
these
frequently
occurring
but
it
took
me
a
good
while
to
enjoy
going
fishing
on
them
the
men
were
glad
to
vary
their
days
by
dropping
a
line
in
that
vile
water
and
i
could
not
escape
their
urging
to
go
though
i
was
excused
from
fishing
on
one
occasion
we
went
down
the
river
on
a
steamer
the
sailors
dragging
the
small
boats
over
the
strip
of
land
between
the
river
and
the
bayou
and
all
went
fishing
or
hunting
this
excursion
was
one
that
i
am
likely
to
remember
forever
the
officers
intent
on
their
fishing
were
rowed
slowly
through
the
thick
water
while
i
was
wondering
to
myself
if
there
could
be
anywhere
such
a
wild
jungle
of
vines
and
moss
as
hung
from
the
trees
and
entangled
itself
in
the
mass
of
weeds
and
below
we
followed
little
indentations
of
the
stream
and
the
boat
was
rowed
into
small
bays
and
near
dark
pools
where
the
fish
are
known
to
stay
and
finally
we
floated
the
very
limbs
of
the
trees
and
the
gnarled
trunks
took
on
human
shape
while
the
drooping
moss
swayed
as
if
it
might
be
the
drapery
of
a
lamia
evolved
out
of
the
noisome
vapors
and
floating
above
us
these
fears
and
imaginings
which
would
have
been
put
to
flight
by
the
assurances
of
the
general
had
he
not
been
so
intent
on
his
line
proved
to
be
not
wholly
spectres
of
the
imagination
a
mass
of
logs
in
front
of
us
seemed
to
move
they
did
move
and
the
alligator
that
looked
so
like
a
established
his
identity
by
separating
himself
from
the
floating
timber
and
making
off
it
was
my
scream
for
the
officers
themselves
did
not
enjoy
the
proximity
of
the
beast
that
caused
the
instant
use
of
the
oars
and
a
quick
retreat
i
went
fishing
after
that
of
course
i
could
get
out
of
it
indeed
i
was
supported
through
my
tremors
by
a
pleasure
to
which
a
woman
can
not
be
indifferent
that
of
being
wanted
on
all
sorts
of
excursions
but
logs
in
the
water
never
looked
like
logs
after
that
to
my
distended
vision
they
appeared
to
writhe
with
the
slow
contortions
of
loathsome
animals
a
soldier
captured
a
one
day
and
the
general
thinking
to
quiet
my
terror
of
them
by
letting
me
see
the
reptile
close
to
as
the
children
say
took
me
down
to
camp
where
the
delighted
soldier
told
me
how
he
had
caught
it
holding
on
to
the
tail
which
is
its
weapon
the
animal
was
all
head
and
tail
there
seemed
to
be
no
intermediate
anatomy
he
flung
the
latter
member
at
a
hat
in
so
vicious
and
violent
a
way
that
i
believed
instantly
the
story
which
i
had
first
received
with
doubt
of
his
rapping
over
a
puppy
and
swallowing
him
before
rescue
could
come
this
pet
was
in
a
long
tank
of
water
the
owner
had
built
and
it
gave
the
soldiers
much
amusement
the
general
was
greatly
interested
in
it
was
said
that
the
scales
were
as
thick
as
a
china
plate
except
on
the
head
and
he
began
to
believe
so
when
he
found
his
balls
glancing
off
the
impenetrable
hide
as
if
from
the
side
of
an
ironclad
i
suppose
it
was
very
exciting
after
the
officers
had
yelped
and
barked
like
a
dog
to
see
the
great
monster
decoyed
from
some
dark
retreat
by
the
sound
of
his
favorite
tidbit
the
wary
game
came
slowly
down
the
bayou
under
fire
of
the
kneeling
huntsmen
concealed
in
the
underbrush
and
was
soon
despatched
for
myself
i
should
have
preferred
had
i
been
consulted
a
post
of
observation
in
the
top
of
some
tree
instead
of
the
boat
in
which
i
was
being
rowed
chapter
iii
a
military
execution
there
was
a
great
deal
to
do
in
those
weeks
of
our
detention
at
alexandria
during
the
working
hours
of
the
day
in
organizing
the
division
of
cavalry
for
the
march
troops
that
had
been
serving
in
the
west
during
the
war
were
brought
together
at
that
point
from
all
directions
and
an
effort
was
made
to
form
them
into
a
disciplined
body
this
herculean
task
gave
my
husband
great
perplexity
he
wrote
to
my
father
that
he
did
not
entirely
blame
the
men
for
the
restlessness
and
insubordination
they
exhibited
as
their
comrades
who
had
enlisted
only
for
the
war
had
gone
home
and
of
course
wrote
back
letters
to
their
friends
of
the
pleasures
of
reunion
with
their
families
and
kindred
and
the
welcome
given
them
by
their
townspeople
the
troops
with
us
had
not
served
out
the
time
of
their
enlistment
and
the
government
according
to
the
strict
letter
of
the
law
had
a
right
to
the
unexpired
time
for
which
the
men
were
pledged
some
of
the
regiments
had
not
known
the
smell
of
gunpowder
during
the
entire
war
having
been
stationed
in
and
near
southern
cities
and
that
duty
is
generally
demoralizing
in
the
reorganizing
of
this
material
every
order
issued
was
met
with
growls
and
grumbling
it
seemed
that
it
had
been
the
custom
with
some
of
their
officers
to
issue
an
order
and
then
go
out
and
make
a
speech
explaining
the
whys
and
wherefores
one
of
the
colonels
came
to
the
general
one
day
at
his
own
quarters
thinking
it
a
better
place
than
the
office
to
make
his
request
he
was
a
spectacle
and
though
general
custer
was
never
in
after
years
incautious
enough
to
mention
his
name
he
could
not
with
his
keen
sense
of
the
ludicrous
resist
a
laughing
description
of
the
interview
the
man
was
large
and
bulky
in
build
over
the
breast
of
a
long
loose
untidy
linen
duster
he
had
spread
the
crimson
sash
as
he
was
officer
of
the
day
a
military
gathered
in
the
voluminous
folds
of
the
coat
and
from
his
side
hung
a
parade
sword
a
slouch
hat
was
crowded
down
on
a
shock
of
bushy
hair
one
was
tucked
into
his
boot
as
if
to
represent
one
foot
in
the
cavalry
the
other
true
to
the
infantry
was
down
in
its
proper
place
he
began
his
interview
by
praising
his
regiment
gave
an
account
of
the
success
with
which
he
was
drilling
his
men
and
leaning
confidentially
on
the
general
knee
told
him
he
would
make
them
so
near
like
regglers
you
could
tell
apart
two
officers
of
the
regular
army
were
then
in
command
of
the
two
brigades
to
one
of
which
this
man
regiment
was
assigned
but
the
object
of
the
visit
was
not
solely
to
praise
his
regiment
he
went
on
to
say
that
an
order
had
been
issued
which
the
men
did
not
like
and
he
had
come
up
to
expostulate
he
did
not
ask
to
have
the
order
rescinded
but
told
the
general
he
would
like
to
have
him
come
down
and
give
the
reasons
to
the
troops
he
added
that
this
was
what
they
expected
and
when
he
issued
any
command
he
went
out
and
got
upon
a
barrel
and
explained
it
to
the
boys
my
husband
listened
patiently
but
declined
as
that
manner
of
issuing
orders
was
hardly
in
accordance
with
his
ideas
of
discipline
the
soldiers
did
not
confine
their
maledictions
to
the
regular
officers
in
command
they
openly
refused
to
obey
their
own
officers
one
of
the
colonels
i
am
glad
i
have
forgotten
his
name
made
a
social
call
at
our
house
he
was
in
great
perturbation
of
mind
and
evidently
terrified
as
in
the
preceding
night
his
dissatisfied
soldiers
had
riddled
his
tent
with
bullets
and
but
for
his
lying
low
he
would
have
been
perforated
like
a
sieve
the
men
supposed
they
had
ended
his
military
career
but
at
daylight
he
crept
out
the
soldiers
were
punished
but
there
seemed
to
be
little
to
expect
in
the
way
of
obedience
if
after
four
years
they
ignored
their
superiors
and
took
affairs
into
their
own
hands
threats
began
to
make
their
way
to
our
house
the
staff
had
their
tents
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
us
and
even
they
tried
to
persuade
the
general
to
lock
the
doors
and
bolt
the
windows
which
were
left
wide
open
day
and
night
failing
to
gain
his
consent
to
take
any
precautions
they
asked
me
to
use
my
influence
but
in
such
affairs
i
had
little
success
in
persuasion
the
servants
and
even
the
orderlies
came
to
me
and
solemnly
warned
me
of
the
threats
and
the
danger
that
menaced
the
general
thoroughly
frightened
in
his
behalf
they
prefaced
their
warnings
with
the
sensational
language
this
night
at
etc
the
fixing
of
the
hour
for
the
arrival
of
the
assassin
completely
unnerved
me
as
i
had
not
then
escaped
from
the
influence
that
the
melodramatic
has
upon
youth
i
ran
to
the
general
the
moment
he
came
from
his
office
duties
to
tell
him
with
tears
and
agitation
of
his
peril
as
usual
he
soothed
my
fears
but
on
this
occasion
only
temporarily
still
seeing
what
i
suffered
from
anxiety
he
made
one
concession
and
consented
after
much
imploring
to
put
a
pistol
under
his
pillow
a
complete
battery
of
artillery
round
our
house
could
not
have
secured
to
me
more
peace
of
mind
than
that
pistol
for
i
knew
the
accuracy
of
his
aim
and
i
had
known
too
much
of
his
cool
resolute
action
in
moments
of
peril
not
to
be
sure
that
the
small
weapon
would
do
its
work
peace
was
restored
to
the
head
of
our
house
he
had
a
respite
from
the
whimpering
and
begging
i
even
grew
so
courageous
as
to
be
able
to
repeat
to
eliza
when
she
came
next
morning
to
put
the
room
in
order
what
the
general
had
said
to
me
that
barking
dogs
do
not
bite
the
mattress
was
proudly
lifted
and
the
pistol
of
which
i
stood
in
awe
in
spite
of
my
faith
in
its
efficacy
was
exhibited
to
her
in
triumph
i
made
wide
détours
around
that
side
of
the
bed
the
rest
of
the
time
we
remained
at
alexandria
afraid
of
the
very
weapon
to
which
i
was
indebted
for
tranquil
hours
the
cats
pigs
and
calves
might
charge
at
will
under
the
house
if
i
mistook
them
for
the
approaching
adversary
i
remembered
the
revolver
and
was
calmed
long
afterward
during
our
winter
in
texas
my
husband
began
one
day
to
appear
mysterious
and
assume
the
suppressed
air
that
invariably
prefaced
a
season
of
tormenting
when
a
siege
of
questions
only
brought
out
deeper
and
obscurer
answers
to
me
pouting
tossing
of
the
head
and
reiterated
announcements
that
i
did
care
a
rap
i
did
want
to
know
were
met
by
chuckles
of
triumph
and
wild
juba
patting
and
dancing
around
the
victim
unrestrained
by
my
saying
that
such
was
the
custom
of
the
savage
while
torturing
his
prisoner
still
he
persisted
that
he
had
such
a
good
joke
on
me
and
it
certainly
was
there
had
not
been
a
round
of
ammunition
in
the
house
that
we
occupied
at
alexandria
neither
had
that
old
pistol
been
loaded
during
the
entire
summer
the
soldiers
became
bolder
in
their
rebellion
insubordination
reached
a
point
where
it
was
almost
uncontrollable
reports
were
sent
to
general
sheridan
in
command
of
the
department
and
he
replied
to
my
husband
use
such
summary
measures
as
you
deem
proper
to
overcome
the
mutinous
disposition
of
the
individuals
in
your
command
a
western
officer
a
stranger
to
us
up
to
that
time
published
an
account
of
one
of
the
regiments
which
explains
what
was
not
clear
to
us
then
as
we
had
come
directly
from
the
army
of
the
potomac
one
regiment
had
suffered
somewhat
from
indifferent
field
officers
but
more
from
the
bad
fortune
that
overtook
so
many
western
regiments
in
the
shape
of
garrison
duty
in
small
squads
or
squadrons
so
scattered
as
to
make
each
a
sort
of
independent
command
which
in
the
end
resulted
in
a
loss
of
discipline
and
the
ruin
of
those
bonds
of
sympathy
that
bound
most
regiments
together
to
lead
such
a
regiment
into
a
hotly
contested
fight
would
be
a
blessing
and
would
effectually
set
at
rest
all
such
trouble
but
their
fighting
had
been
altogether
of
the
guerrilla
kind
and
there
was
no
regimental
pride
of
character
simply
because
there
had
been
no
regimental
deed
of
valor
tired
out
with
the
long
service
weary
with
an
uncomfortable
journey
by
river
from
memphis
sweltering
under
a
sun
under
orders
to
go
farther
and
farther
from
home
when
the
war
was
over
the
one
desire
was
to
be
mustered
out
and
released
from
a
service
that
became
irksome
and
baleful
when
a
prospect
of
crushing
the
enemy
no
longer
existed
all
these
added
to
the
dissatisfaction
among
the
officers
rendered
the
situation
truly
deplorable
the
command
had
hardly
pitched
their
tents
at
alexandria
before
the
spirit
of
reckless
disregard
of
authority
began
to
manifest
itself
the
men
singly
or
in
squads
began
to
go
on
extemporaneous
raids
through
the
adjoining
country
robbing
and
plundering
indiscriminately
in
every
direction
they
seemed
to
have
no
idea
that
a
conquered
and
subdued
people
could
possibly
have
any
rights
that
the
conquerors
were
bound
to
respect
but
general
custer
was
under
orders
to
treat
the
people
kindly
and
considerately
and
he
obeyed
orders
with
the
same
punctiliousness
with
which
he
exacted
obedience
from
his
command
the
anger
and
hatred
of
these
troops
toward
one
especial
officer
culminated
in
their
peremptory
demand
that
he
should
resign
they
drew
up
a
paper
and
signed
their
names
he
had
not
a
friend
and
sought
the
commanding
officer
for
protection
this
was
too
pronounced
a
case
of
mutiny
to
be
treated
with
any
but
the
promptest
severest
measures
and
all
who
had
put
their
names
to
the
document
were
placed
under
arrest
the
paper
was
in
reality
but
a
small
part
of
the
incessant
persecution
which
included
threats
of
all
kinds
against
the
life
of
the
hated
man
but
it
was
written
proof
that
his
statements
regarding
his
danger
were
true
all
but
one
of
those
that
were
implicated
apologized
and
were
restored
to
duty
a
sergeant
held
out
and
refused
to
acknowledge
himself
in
the
wrong
a
tried
him
and
he
was
sentenced
to
death
those
who
had
been
associated
in
the
rebellion
against
their
officer
were
thoroughly
frightened
and
seriously
grieved
at
the
fate
to
which
their
comrade
had
been
consigned
by
their
uncontrollable
rage
and
began
to
speak
among
themselves
of
the
wife
and
children
at
home
the
wife
was
unconscious
that
the
heartbreaking
revelations
were
on
their
way
that
the
saddest
of
woman
sorrows
widowhood
was
hers
to
endure
and
that
her
children
must
bear
a
tainted
name
it
came
to
be
whispered
about
that
the
doomed
man
wore
on
his
heart
a
curl
of
baby
hair
that
had
been
cut
from
his
child
head
when
he
went
out
to
serve
his
imperiled
country
finally
the
wretched
soldiers
sued
for
pardon
for
their
condemned
companion
and
the
very
man
against
whom
the
enmity
had
been
cherished
and
who
owed
his
life
to
an
accident
busied
himself
in
collecting
the
name
of
every
man
in
the
command
begging
clemency
for
the
imperiled
sergeant
six
days
passed
and
there
was
increased
misery
among
the
men
who
felt
themselves
responsible
for
their
comrade
life
the
prayer
for
pardon
with
its
long
roll
of
names
had
been
met
by
the
general
with
the
reply
that
the
matter
would
be
considered
the
men
now
prepared
for
vengeance
they
lay
around
the
or
grouped
themselves
in
tents
saying
that
the
commanding
officer
would
not
dare
to
execute
the
sentence
of
the
while
messages
of
this
kind
reached
my
husband
in
cowardly
roundabout
ways
and
threats
and
menaces
seemed
to
fill
the
air
the
preparation
for
the
execution
was
ordered
and
directions
given
that
a
deserter
tried
by
and
condemned
should
be
shot
on
the
same
day
this
man
a
vagabond
and
criminal
before
his
enlistment
had
deserted
three
or
four
times
and
his
sentence
drew
little
pity
from
his
comrades
at
last
dawned
in
the
lovely
valley
that
dreadful
day
which
i
recall
now
with
a
shudder
it
was
impossible
to
keep
me
from
knowing
that
an
execution
was
to
occur
there
was
no
place
to
send
me
the
subterfuges
by
which
my
husband
had
kept
me
from
knowing
the
tragic
or
the
sorrowful
in
our
military
life
heretofore
were
of
no
avail
now
fortunately
i
knew
nothing
of
the
petition
for
pardon
nothing
thank
god
of
the
wife
at
her
home
or
of
the
curl
of
baby
hair
that
was
rising
and
falling
over
the
throbbing
agonized
heart
of
the
condemned
father
and
how
the
capacity
we
may
have
for
embracing
the
sorrows
of
the
whole
world
disappears
when
our
selfish
terrors
concentrate
on
the
safety
of
our
own
loved
ones
the
sergeant
life
was
precious
as
a
life
but
the
threats
the
ominous
and
quiet
watching
the
malignant
revengeful
faces
of
the
troops
about
us
told
me
plainly
that
another
day
might
darken
my
life
forever
and
i
was
consumed
by
my
own
torturing
suspense
rumors
of
the
proposed
murder
of
my
husband
reached
me
through
the
kitchen
the
orderlies
about
our
quarters
and
at
last
through
the
staff
they
had
fallen
into
the
fashion
of
my
husband
and
spared
me
anything
that
was
agitating
or
alarming
but
this
was
a
time
they
felt
when
all
possible
measures
should
be
taken
to
protect
the
general
and
they
implored
me
to
induce
him
to
take
precautions
for
his
safety
my
pleading
was
of
no
avail
he
had
ordered
the
staff
to
follow
him
unarmed
to
the
execution
they
begged
him
to
wear
his
or
at
least
permit
them
the
privilege
in
order
that
they
might
defend
him
but
he
resolutely
refused
how
trivial
seem
all
attempts
to
describe
the
agonies
of
mind
that
filled
that
black
hour
when
the
general
and
his
staff
rode
from
our
lawn
toward
the
dreaded
field
eliza
ever
thoughtful
of
me
hovered
round
the
bed
where
i
had
buried
my
head
in
the
pillows
to
deaden
the
sound
of
the
expected
volley
with
terms
of
endearment
and
soothing
she
sought
to
assure
me
that
nothing
would
happen
to
the
general
nothin
ever
does
you
know
miss
libbie
she
said
her
voice
full
of
the
mother
in
us
all
when
we
seek
to
console
and
yet
that
woman
knew
all
the
plans
for
the
general
death
all
the
venom
in
the
hearts
of
those
who
surrounded
us
and
she
felt
no
hope
for
his
safety
pomp
and
circumstance
are
not
alone
for
glorious
war
but
in
army
life
must
also
be
observed
in
times
of
peace
there
are
good
reasons
for
it
i
suppose
the
more
form
and
solemnity
the
deeper
the
impression
and
as
this
day
was
to
be
a
crucial
one
in
proving
to
the
insubordinate
that
order
must
eventually
prevail
nothing
was
hurried
none
of
the
usual
customs
were
omitted
five
thousand
soldiers
formed
a
hollow
square
in
a
field
near
the
town
the
staff
accustomed
to
take
a
position
and
remain
with
their
general
near
the
opening
left
by
the
division
followed
with
wonder
and
alarm
as
he
rode
slowly
around
the
entire
line
so
near
the
troops
that
a
hand
might
have
been
stretched
out
to
deal
a
fatal
blow
the
wagon
drawn
by
four
horses
bearing
the
criminals
sitting
on
their
coffins
followed
at
a
slow
pace
escorted
by
the
guard
and
the
with
reversed
arms
the
coffins
were
placed
in
the
centre
of
the
square
and
the
men
seated
upon
them
at
the
foot
of
their
open
graves
eight
men
with
livid
countenances
and
vehemently
beating
hearts
took
their
places
in
front
of
their
comrades
and
looked
upon
the
blanched
despairing
faces
of
those
whom
they
were
ordered
to
kill
the
carried
their
carbines
off
to
a
distance
loaded
seven
and
placed
a
blank
cartridge
in
the
eighth
thus
giving
the
merciful
boon
of
permanent
uncertainty
as
to
whose
was
the
fatal
shot
the
eyes
of
the
poor
victims
were
then
bandaged
while
thousands
of
men
held
their
breath
as
the
tragedy
went
on
the
still
southern
air
of
that
garden
on
earth
was
unmoved
by
any
sound
save
the
unceasing
notes
of
the
that
sang
night
and
day
in
the
hedges
preparations
had
been
so
accurately
made
that
there
was
but
one
word
to
be
spoken
after
the
reading
of
the
warrant
for
execution
and
that
the
last
that
those
most
miserable
and
hopeless
of
god
creatures
should
hear
on
earth
there
was
still
one
more
duty
for
the
before
the
fatal
word
fire
was
sounded
but
one
person
understood
his
movements
as
he
stealthily
drew
near
the
sergeant
took
his
arm
and
led
him
aside
in
an
instant
his
voice
rang
out
the
fatal
word
and
the
deserter
fell
back
dead
in
blessed
ignorance
that
he
went
into
eternity
alone
while
the
sergeant
swooned
in
the
arms
of
the
when
he
was
revived
it
was
explained
to
him
that
the
general
believed
him
to
have
been
the
victim
of
undue
influence
and
had
long
since
determined
upon
the
pardon
but
some
punishment
he
thought
necessary
and
he
was
also
determined
that
the
soldiers
should
not
feel
that
he
had
been
intimidated
from
performing
his
duty
because
his
own
life
was
in
peril
it
was
ascertained
afterward
that
the
sergeant
regiment
had
gone
out
that
day
with
loaded
carbines
and
forty
rounds
besides
but
the
knowledge
of
this
would
have
altered
no
plan
nor
would
it
have
induced
the
commanding
officer
to
reveal
to
any
but
his
the
final
decision
let
us
hope
that
in
these
blessed
days
of
peace
some
other
tiny
curls
are
nestling
in
a
grandfather
neck
instead
of
lying
over
his
heart
as
did
the
son
in
those
days
when
memories
and
mementos
were
all
we
had
of
those
we
loved
general
custer
not
only
had
his
own
division
to
organize
and
discipline
but
was
constantly
occupied
in
trying
to
establish
some
sort
of
harmony
between
the
confederate
soldiers
the
citizens
and
his
command
the
blood
of
everyone
was
at
then
the
soldiers
had
not
the
grief
of
returning
to
homes
desolated
by
war
because
louisiana
escaped
much
and
texas
all
of
the
devastation
of
campaigns
but
they
came
home
obliged
to
begin
the
world
again
the
negroes
of
the
red
river
country
were
not
an
easy
class
to
manage
in
days
of
slavery
we
heard
that
all
desperate
characters
in
the
border
states
had
been
sold
into
louisiana
because
of
its
comparative
isolation
and
that
the
most
ungovernable
cases
were
congregated
in
the
valley
of
the
red
river
however
that
may
have
been
it
certainly
was
difficult
to
make
them
conform
to
the
new
state
of
affairs
the
master
unaccustomed
to
freedom
still
treated
the
negro
as
a
slave
the
colored
man
inflated
with
freedom
and
reveling
in
idleness
would
not
accept
common
directions
in
labor
how
even
the
south
tolerates
a
name
that
it
once
hated
in
the
prosperity
of
the
new
regime
and
in
the
prospect
of
their
splendid
future
how
fresh
the
enthusiasm
in
the
present
day
at
any
mention
of
the
liberator
of
the
slaves
but
when
we
consider
through
what
bungling
errors
we
groped
blindly
in
those
early
days
of
emancipation
we
might
well
wish
that
abraham
lincoln
could
have
been
spared
to
bring
his
justice
and
gentle
humanity
to
bear
upon
the
adjusting
of
that
great
transition
from
slavery
to
freedom
at
the
least
intimation
of
a
show
or
a
funeral
which
is
a
festivity
to
them
on
account
of
the
crowds
that
congregate
off
went
the
entire
body
of
men
even
if
the
crops
were
in
danger
of
spoiling
for
want
of
harvesting
it
was
a
time
in
our
history
that
one
does
not
like
to
look
back
upon
the
excitement
into
which
the
land
was
thrown
not
only
by
war
but
by
the
puzzling
question
of
how
to
reconcile
master
to
servant
and
servant
to
master
for
the
colored
people
were
an
element
most
difficult
to
manage
owing
to
their
ignorance
and
the
sudden
change
of
relations
to
their
former
owners
all
this
created
new
and
perplexing
problems
which
were
the
order
of
each
day
the
confederate
soldiers
had
to
get
their
blood
down
from
fever
heat
some
took
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the
war
was
over
and
the
government
was
ordering
its
soldiers
into
the
state
not
as
invaders
but
as
pacifiers
to
drag
their
sabres
through
the
street
and
talk
loudly
on
the
corners
in
belligerent
language
without
fear
of
the
imprisonment
that
in
had
so
quickly
followed
the
general
was
obliged
to
issue
simultaneous
orders
to
his
own
men
demanding
their
observance
of
every
right
of
the
citizen
and
to
the
returned
confederate
soldiers
assuring
them
that
the
government
had
not
sent
troops
into
their
country
as
belligerents
but
insisting
upon
certain
obligations
as
citizens
from
them
in
an
order
to
the
division
he
said
numerous
complaints
having
reached
these
headquarters
of
depredations
having
been
committed
by
persons
belonging
to
this
command
all
officers
and
soldiers
are
hereby
urged
to
use
every
exertion
to
prevent
the
committal
of
acts
of
lawlessness
which
if
permitted
to
pass
unpunished
will
bring
discredit
upon
the
command
now
that
the
war
is
virtually
ended
the
rebellion
put
down
and
peace
about
to
be
restored
to
our
entire
country
let
not
the
lustre
of
the
past
four
years
be
dimmed
by
a
single
act
of
misconduct
toward
the
persons
or
property
of
those
with
whom
we
may
be
brought
in
contact
in
the
future
and
particularly
on
the
march
the
utmost
care
will
be
exercised
to
save
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
in
which
we
may
be
located
from
any
molestation
whatever
every
violation
of
order
regarding
foraging
will
be
punished
the
is
well
aware
that
the
number
of
those
upon
whom
the
enforcement
of
this
order
will
be
necessary
will
be
small
and
he
trusts
that
in
no
case
will
it
be
necessary
all
officers
and
soldiers
of
this
command
are
earnestly
reminded
to
treat
the
inhabitants
of
this
department
with
conciliation
and
kindness
and
particularly
is
this
injunction
necessary
when
we
are
brought
in
contact
with
those
who
lately
were
in
arms
against
us
you
can
well
afford
to
be
generous
and
magnanimous
in
another
order
addressed
to
the
confederate
soldiers
he
said
it
is
expected
and
it
will
be
required
that
those
who
were
once
our
enemies
but
are
now
to
be
treated
as
friends
will
in
return
refrain
from
idle
boasts
which
can
only
result
in
harm
to
themselves
if
there
still
be
any
who
blind
to
the
events
of
the
past
four
years
continue
to
indulge
in
seditious
harangues
all
such
disturbers
of
the
peace
will
be
arrested
and
brought
to
these
headquarters
between
the
troublesome
negroes
the
unsubdued
confederates
and
the
lawless
among
our
own
soldiers
life
was
by
no
means
an
easy
problem
to
solve
a
boy
of
was
then
expected
to
act
the
subtle
part
of
statesman
and
patriot
and
conciliate
and
soothe
the
citizen
the
part
of
stern
and
unrelenting
soldier
punishing
evidences
of
unsuppressed
rebellion
on
the
part
of
the
conquered
and
at
the
same
time
the
vigilant
commanding
officer
exacting
obedience
from
his
own
disaffected
soldiery
as
for
the
positions
he
filled
toward
the
negro
they
were
varied
counseling
these
duties
to
those
who
employed
them
warning
them
from
idleness
and
urging
them
to
work
feeding
and
clothing
the
impoverished
and
the
old
it
seems
to
me
it
was
a
position
combining
in
one
man
doctor
lawyer
taskmaster
father
and
provider
the
town
and
camp
swarmed
with
the
colored
people
lazily
lying
around
waiting
for
the
government
to
take
care
of
them
and
it
was
necessary
to
issue
a
long
order
to
the
negroes
from
which
i
make
an
extract
since
the
recent
advent
of
the
united
states
forces
into
this
vicinity
many
of
the
freedmen
of
the
surrounding
country
seem
to
have
imbibed
the
idea
that
they
will
no
longer
be
required
to
labor
for
their
own
support
and
the
support
of
those
depending
upon
them
such
ideas
can
not
be
tolerated
being
alike
injurious
to
the
interests
and
welfare
of
the
freedmen
and
their
employers
freedmen
must
not
look
upon
military
posts
as
places
of
idle
resort
from
which
they
can
draw
their
means
of
support
their
proper
course
is
to
obtain
employment
if
possible
upon
the
same
plantations
where
they
were
previously
employed
general
order
no
headquarters
department
of
the
gulf
march
prescribes
the
rules
of
contract
in
the
case
of
these
persons
the
coming
crops
already
maturing
require
cultivation
and
will
furnish
employment
for
all
who
are
disposed
to
be
industrious
hereafter
no
freedmen
will
be
permitted
to
remain
in
the
vicinity
of
the
camps
who
are
not
engaged
in
some
proper
employment
standing
alone
in
the
midst
of
all
this
confusion
and
endeavoring
to
administer
justice
on
all
sides
general
custer
had
by
no
means
an
enviable
task
i
do
not
wonder
now
that
he
kept
his
perplexities
as
much
as
possible
from
me
he
wished
to
spare
me
anxiety
and
the
romp
or
the
gallop
over
the
fragrant
field
which
he
asked
for
as
soon
as
were
over
was
probably
more
enjoyable
with
a
woman
with
uncorrugated
brow
still
i
see
now
the
puzzled
shake
of
the
head
as
he
said
a
man
may
do
everything
to
keep
a
woman
from
knowledge
of
official
matters
and
then
she
gets
so
confounded
keen
in
putting
little
trifles
together
the
first
thing
you
know
she
is
reading
a
man
very
thoughts
yet
it
does
not
strike
me
as
remarkable
keenness
on
the
part
of
a
woman
if
after
the
experience
she
gains
in
following
the
bugle
a
time
and
with
her
wits
sharpened
by
affection
she
decides
that
a
move
is
about
to
take
place
the
general
used
to
turn
quickly
almost
suspiciously
to
me
and
say
as
if
i
had
been
told
by
the
staff
how
did
you
find
out
we
were
ordered
to
move
when
he
had
been
sending
for
the
quartermaster
and
the
commissary
and
looking
at
his
maps
for
ever
so
long
before
it
was
not
much
of
a
mystery
to
solve
when
the
quartermaster
meant
transportation
the
commissary
food
and
the
maps
a
new
route
after
determined
efforts
to
establish
discipline
order
began
to
be
evolved
out
of
the
chaos
and
the
men
resigned
themselves
to
their
hard
fate
much
as
i
feared
them
and
greatly
as
i
had
resented
their
attempt
to
lay
all
their
present
detention
and
compulsory
service
to
my
husband
i
could
not
but
agree
with
him
when
he
argued
for
them
that
it
was
pretty
hard
not
to
be
allowed
to
go
home
when
the
other
soldiers
had
returned
to
receive
the
rewards
of
the
victorious
they
wrote
home
abusive
newspaper
articles
which
were
promptly
mailed
to
the
general
by
unknown
hands
but
of
which
he
took
no
notice
i
recollect
only
once
after
that
knowing
of
an
absolutely
disagreeable
encounter
during
the
following
winter
in
texas
my
husband
came
quickly
into
our
room
one
morning
took
my
and
returned
across
the
hall
to
his
office
in
a
short
time
he
as
quickly
returned
and
restored
it
to
its
place
and
i
extracted
from
him
an
explanation
among
the
newspaper
articles
sent
him
from
the
north
there
was
an
attack
on
his
dear
quiet
unoffending
father
and
mother
he
sent
for
the
officer
who
was
credited
with
the
authorship
and
after
his
denial
of
the
article
told
him
what
he
had
intended
to
do
had
he
been
guilty
of
such
an
assault
that
he
was
prepared
for
any
attack
on
himself
but
nothing
would
make
him
submit
to
seeing
his
parents
assailed
then
he
bade
him
and
bowed
him
out
the
effect
of
the
weeks
of
discipline
on
the
division
was
visible
on
our
march
into
texas
the
general
had
believed
that
the
men
would
eventually
conform
to
the
restrictions
and
he
was
heartily
relieved
and
glad
to
find
that
they
did
the
texans
were
amazed
at
the
absence
of
the
lawlessness
they
had
expected
from
our
army
and
thankful
to
find
that
the
yankee
column
was
neither
devastating
nor
even
injuring
their
hitherto
unmolested
state
for
the
war
on
land
had
not
reached
texas
the
troops
were
not
permitted
to
live
on
the
country
as
is
the
usage
of
war
and
only
one
instance
occurred
during
the
entire
march
of
a
soldier
simply
helping
himself
to
a
farmer
grain
every
pound
of
food
and
forage
was
bought
by
the
quartermaster
it
was
hard
to
realize
that
the
column
marching
in
a
methodical
and
orderly
manner
was
so
short
a
time
before
a
lawless
and
mutinous
command
they
hated
us
i
suppose
that
is
the
penalty
the
commanding
officer
generally
pays
for
what
still
seems
to
me
the
questionable
privilege
of
rank
and
power
whatever
they
thought
it
did
not
deter
us
from
commending
among
ourselves
the
good
material
in
those
western
men
which
so
soon
made
them
orderly
and
obedient
soldiers
but
i
have
anticipated
somewhat
and
must
go
back
and
say
to
that
rich
valley
it
had
been
a
strange
experience
to
me
i
had
no
woman
but
eliza
to
whom
i
could
speak
the
country
and
all
its
customs
seemed
like
another
world
into
which
i
had
unexpectedly
entered
i
had
spent
many
hours
of
anxiety
about
my
husband
safety
but
the
anxiety
heat
mosquitoes
poor
water
alligators
mutiny
all
combined
failed
to
extract
a
complaint
there
was
not
an
atom
of
heroism
in
this
it
was
undeniably
the
shrewd
cunning
of
which
women
are
accused
for
i
lived
in
hourly
dread
of
being
sent
to
texas
by
the
other
route
via
new
orleans
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
the
general
had
been
advised
by
letters
from
home
to
send
me
that
way
on
the
ground
that
i
could
not
endure
a
march
at
that
season
officers
took
on
a
tone
of
superiority
and
said
that
they
would
not
think
of
taking
wives
into
such
a
wilderness
my
fate
hung
in
the
balance
and
under
such
circumstances
it
was
not
strange
that
the
inconveniences
of
our
stay
on
red
river
were
not
even
so
much
as
acknowledged
it
is
true
that
i
was
not
then
a
veteran
campaigner
and
the
very
newness
of
the
hardships
would
doubtless
have
called
forth
a
few
sighs
had
not
the
fear
of
another
separation
haunted
me
it
is
astonishing
how
much
grumbling
is
suppressed
by
the
fear
of
something
worse
awaiting
you
in
the
decision
which
direction
i
was
to
take
i
won
my
husband
scruples
were
overcome
by
my
unanswerable
arguments
and
his
own
inclination
i
prepared
to
leave
alexandria
with
regret
for
the
pleasures
of
our
stay
had
outnumbered
the
drawbacks
it
was
our
first
knowledge
that
the
earth
could
be
so
lovely
and
so
lavishly
laden
with
what
began
to
be
tropical
luxuriance
i
do
not
recall
the
names
of
all
the
birds
but
the
throats
of
all
of
them
seemed
to
be
filled
with
song
in
a
semicircle
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
our
house
grew
a
thick
hedge
of
crape
myrtle
covered
with
fragrant
blossoms
here
the
fearlessly
built
their
nests
and
the
stillest
hour
of
the
night
was
made
melodious
with
the
song
that
twilight
had
been
too
short
to
complete
really
the
summer
day
there
was
too
brief
to
tell
all
that
these
birds
had
to
say
to
their
mates
to
the
general
who
would
have
had
an
aviary
had
it
been
just
the
thing
for
a
mounted
regiment
all
this
song
day
and
night
was
enchanting
in
after
years
he
never
forgot
those
midnight
serenades
and
in
he
took
a
into
the
bleak
climate
of
dakota
eliza
mildly
growled
at
sich
nonsense
as
toting
round
a
bird
when
was
all
folks
like
us
could
do
to
get
transportation
for
a
nevertheless
she
took
excellent
care
of
the
feathered
tribe
that
we
owned
among
the
fruits
we
first
ate
in
louisiana
were
fresh
figs
which
we
picked
from
the
tree
it
was
something
to
write
home
about
but
at
the
same
time
we
wished
that
instead
we
might
have
a
northern
apple
the
time
came
to
bid
farewell
to
birds
fruits
jasmine
and
rose
and
prepare
for
a
plunge
into
the
wilderness
much
talked
of
with
foreboding
prophecies
by
the
citizens
but
a
hundred
times
worse
in
reality
than
the
gloomiest
predictions
it
was
known
that
the
country
through
which
we
were
to
travel
having
been
inaccessible
to
merchants
and
being
even
then
infested
with
guerrillas
had
large
accumulations
of
cotton
stored
at
intervals
along
the
route
that
was
marked
out
for
our
journey
speculators
arrived
from
new
orleans
and
solicited
the
privilege
of
following
with
wagons
that
they
intended
to
load
with
cotton
they
asked
no
favors
desiring
only
the
protection
that
the
cavalry
column
would
afford
and
expected
to
make
their
way
in
our
wake
until
the
seaboard
was
reached
and
they
could
ship
their
purchases
by
the
gulf
of
mexico
but
their
request
was
refused
as
the
general
hardly
thought
it
a
fitting
use
to
which
to
put
the
army
then
they
assailed
the
quartermaster
offering
thousand
dollars
to
the
general
and
him
as
a
bribe
but
both
men
laughed
to
scorn
that
manner
of
getting
rich
and
returned
to
their
homes
the
year
after
as
poor
as
when
they
had
left
there
five
years
before
as
i
think
of
the
instances
that
came
under
my
knowledge
when
quartermasters
could
have
made
fortunes
it
is
a
marvel
to
me
that
they
so
often
resisted
all
manner
of
temptation
the
old
tale
perhaps
dating
back
to
the
war
of
still
applies
as
it
is
a
constantly
recurring
experience
there
was
once
a
wag
in
the
quartermaster
department
and
even
when
weighted
down
with
grave
responsibility
of
a
portion
of
the
government
treasury
he
still
retained
a
glimmer
of
fun
contractors
lay
in
wait
for
him
with
bribes
which
his
spirit
of
humor
allowed
to
increase
even
though
the
offers
were
insults
to
his
honor
finally
reaching
a
very
large
sum
in
sheer
desperation
he
wrote
to
the
war
department
in
the
name
of
all
the
gods
relieve
me
from
this
department
they
almost
got
up
to
my
price
civilians
hardly
realize
that
even
in
times
of
peace
like
this
when
the
disbursements
will
not
compare
with
the
money
spent
in
years
of
war
between
eight
and
nine
millions
of
dollars
are
yearly
paid
out
by
the
department
alone
since
the
war
the
embezzlements
have
been
hardly
worthy
of
so
serious
a
name
amounting
to
but
a
few
hundred
dollars
all
told
the
general
had
an
ambulance
fitted
up
as
a
for
me
the
seats
so
arranged
that
the
leather
backs
could
be
unstrapped
at
the
sides
and
laid
down
so
as
to
form
a
bed
if
i
wished
to
rest
during
the
march
there
was
a
pocket
for
my
needlework
and
book
and
a
box
for
luncheon
while
my
and
shawl
were
strapped
at
the
side
convenient
but
out
of
the
way
it
was
quite
a
complete
little
house
of
itself
one
of
the
soldiers
who
was
interested
in
the
preparations
for
my
comfort
covered
a
canteen
with
leather
adding
of
his
own
accord
in
fine
stitchery
in
the
yellow
silk
used
by
the
saddlers
lady
custer
each
day
of
our
journey
this
lofty
distinction
became
more
and
more
incongruous
and
amusing
as
i
realized
the
increasing
ugliness
for
which
the
rough
life
was
in
a
measure
responsible
by
the
time
we
reached
the
end
of
our
march
there
was
a
yawning
gulf
between
the
soldier
title
and
the
appearance
of
the
owner
of
the
canteen
the
guide
that
had
been
employed
was
well
up
in
all
the
devices
for
securing
what
little
measure
of
comfort
was
to
be
found
in
overland
travel
i
followed
his
suggestion
and
after
the
canteen
was
filled
in
the
morning
it
was
covered
with
a
piece
of
wet
blanket
and
hung
with
the
cork
left
out
to
the
roof
of
the
wagon
in
order
to
catch
all
the
air
that
might
be
stirring
under
this
damp
treatment
the
yellow
letters
of
lady
custer
faded
out
as
effectually
as
did
all
semblance
of
whatever
delicacy
of
coloring
the
owner
once
possessed
a
short
time
after
we
set
out
we
left
the
valley
of
the
red
river
with
its
fertile
plantations
and
entered
a
pine
forest
on
the
through
which
our
route
lay
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
a
great
portion
of
the
higher
ground
was
sterile
and
the
forest
much
of
the
way
was
thinly
inhabited
we
had
expected
to
hire
a
room
in
any
at
which
we
halted
at
the
end
of
each
day
journey
and
have
the
privilege
of
sleeping
in
a
bed
camping
on
the
ground
was
an
old
story
to
me
after
our
long
march
in
virginia
but
with
the
prospect
of
using
the
bosom
of
mother
earth
as
a
for
the
coming
thirty
years
we
were
willing
to
improve
any
opportunity
to
be
comfortable
when
we
could
the
cabins
that
we
passed
on
the
first
day
discouraged
us
small
low
log
huts
consisting
of
one
room
each
entirely
separated
and
having
a
floored
open
space
between
them
were
the
customary
architecture
the
windows
and
doors
were
filled
with
the
vacant
faces
of
the
untidy
children
of
the
poor
white
trash
and
negroes
the
men
and
women
slouched
and
skulked
around
the
cabins
out
of
sight
and
every
sign
of
abject
loathsome
poverty
was
visible
even
in
the
gaunt
and
famished
pigs
that
rooted
around
the
doorway
i
determined
to
camp
out
until
we
came
to
more
inviting
habitations
which
i
regret
to
say
we
did
not
find
on
that
march
we
had
not
brought
the
thin
mattress
and
pillows
that
had
been
made
for
our
in
virginia
but
the
hardest
sort
of
was
preferable
to
braving
the
squalor
of
the
huts
along
our
way
my
husband
rolled
his
overcoat
for
my
pillow
telling
me
that
a
soldier
slept
like
a
top
with
such
an
one
and
it
was
much
better
than
a
saddle
in
the
hollow
of
which
he
had
often
laid
his
flaxen
but
a
woman
can
not
make
herself
into
a
good
soldier
all
in
a
minute
if
one
takes
hold
of
the
thick
unwieldy
material
that
uncle
sam
puts
into
the
army
overcoat
some
idea
can
be
gained
of
the
rocky
roll
it
makes
when
doing
duty
as
a
and
anyone
whose
neck
has
made
the
steep
incline
from
head
to
shoulder
that
this
substitute
for
a
pillow
necessitates
is
apt
to
waken
less
patriotic
than
when
he
retired
after
repeated
efforts
to
get
accustomed
to
this
buoyed
up
by
my
praise
of
my
behavior
i
confided
to
eliza
that
i
should
not
be
ungrateful
for
any
device
she
might
think
out
for
my
relief
if
she
would
promise
not
to
tell
that
i
had
spoken
to
her
the
next
day
she
gathered
moss
from
the
trees
along
the
stream
and
i
felt
that
i
could
serve
my
country
just
as
well
by
resting
on
this
soft
bed
i
had
begged
off
from
using
a
tent
in
that
country
as
there
seemed
to
be
no
insect
that
was
not
poisonous
and
even
many
of
the
vines
and
underbrush
were
dangerous
to
touch
my
husband
had
the
wagon
placed
in
front
of
the
tent
every
night
when
our
march
was
ended
and
lifted
me
in
and
out
of
the
high
where
i
felt
that
nothing
venomous
could
climb
up
and
sting
the
moss
though
very
comfortable
often
held
in
its
meshes
the
horned
toad
a
harmless
little
mottled
creature
that
had
two
tiny
horns
which
it
turned
from
side
to
side
in
the
gravest
most
knowing
sort
of
way
the
officers
sent
these
little
creatures
home
by
mail
as
curiosities
and
true
to
their
indifference
to
air
they
jumped
out
of
the
box
at
the
journey
end
in
just
the
same
active
manner
that
they
had
hopped
about
under
our
feet
still
harmless
as
they
were
held
to
be
they
were
not
exactly
my
choice
as
any
more
than
the
lizards
the
texans
call
swifts
which
also
haunted
the
tangles
of
the
moss
eliza
tried
to
shake
out
and
beat
it
thoroughly
in
order
to
dislodge
any
inhabitants
before
making
my
bed
one
night
i
found
that
hay
had
been
substituted
and
felt
myself
rich
in
luxury
i
remembered
gladly
that
hay
was
so
clean
so
free
from
all
natural
history
and
closed
my
eyes
in
gratitude
and
then
it
smelt
so
good
so
much
better
than
the
damp
vegetable
odor
of
the
moss
a
smudge
at
the
end
of
the
wagon
was
rising
about
me
to
drive
away
mosquitoes
and
though
the
smoke
scalds
the
eyes
in
this
heroic
remedy
i
still
comforted
myself
with
the
fresh
odor
of
the
hay
and
quietly
thought
that
life
in
a
manger
was
not
the
worst
fate
that
could
come
to
one
all
this
pervading
sense
of
comfort
was
slightly
disturbed
in
the
night
when
i
was
awakened
by
a
munching
and
crunching
at
my
ear
wisps
of
hay
were
lying
over
the
side
of
the
wagon
as
it
was
too
warm
to
leave
the
curtains
down
and
the
attraction
proved
too
much
for
a
stray
mule
which
was
quietly
eating
the
pillow
from
under
my
head
it
was
well
our
tent
and
wagon
were
placed
to
one
side
quite
off
by
themselves
for
the
general
would
have
waked
the
camp
with
his
peals
of
laughter
at
my
indignation
and
momentary
fright
it
did
not
need
much
persuasion
to
rout
the
mule
after
all
the
hubbub
my
husband
made
with
his
merriment
but
i
found
that
i
inclined
to
the
moss
bed
after
that
illustration
a
mule
lunching
from
a
pillow
as
we
advanced
farther
into
the
forest
eliza
received
further
whispered
confidences
about
my
neck
stiff
and
sore
from
the
roll
of
patriotic
blue
that
was
still
the
rest
for
my
tired
head
and
she
resolved
to
make
an
attempt
to
get
a
feather
pillow
one
day
she
discovered
near
our
camp
a
house
that
was
cleaner
than
the
rest
we
had
seen
and
began
negotiations
with
the
mistress
she
offered
a
greenback
as
we
had
no
silver
then
but
they
had
never
seen
one
and
would
not
believe
that
it
was
legal
money
finally
the
woman
said
that
if
we
had
any
calico
or
muslin
for
sale
she
would
exchange
her
pillows
for
either
the
one
or
the
other
eliza
forgot
her
diplomacy
and
rather
indignantly
explained
that
we
were
not
traveling
peddlers
at
last
after
several
trips
to
and
from
our
camp
in
which
i
was
secretly
interested
she
made
what
she
thought
a
successful
trade
by
exchanging
some
blankets
like
the
description
of
the
first
pillows
which
he
said
he
lost
in
his
ear
they
were
diminutive
excuses
for
our
idea
of
what
one
should
be
but
i
can
not
remember
anything
that
ever
impressed
me
as
such
a
luxury
and
i
was
glad
to
see
that
when
the
pillows
were
installed
in
their
place
the
faith
in
my
patriotism
and
in
my
willingness
to
endure
privations
was
not
shaken
the
general
was
satisfied
with
his
soldiers
and
admired
the
manner
in
which
they
endured
the
trials
of
that
hard
experience
his
perplexities
departed
when
they
took
everything
so
bravely
he
tried
to
arrange
our
marches
every
day
so
that
we
might
not
travel
over
fifteen
miles
so
far
as
i
can
remember
there
was
no
one
whose
temper
and
strength
were
not
tried
to
the
uttermost
except
my
husband
his
seeming
indifference
to
excessive
heat
his
having
long
before
conquered
thirst
his
apparent
unconsciousness
of
the
stings
or
bites
of
insects
were
powerful
aids
in
encountering
those
suffocating
days
frequently
after
a
long
march
when
we
all
gasped
for
breath
and
in
our
exhaustion
flung
ourselves
down
anywhere
to
die
as
we
laughingly
said
a
fresh
horse
was
saddled
and
off
went
the
general
for
a
hunt
or
to
look
up
the
prospects
for
water
in
our
next
day
journey
if
this
stifling
atmosphere
to
which
we
were
daily
subjected
disturbed
him
we
did
not
know
it
he
held
that
grumbling
did
not
mend
matters
but
i
differed
with
him
i
still
think
a
little
complaining
when
the
patience
is
sorely
taxed
eases
the
troubled
soul
though
at
that
time
i
took
good
care
not
to
put
my
theory
into
practice
for
reasons
i
have
explained
when
the
question
of
my
joining
the
march
hung
in
the
balance
my
life
in
a
wagon
soon
became
such
an
old
story
that
i
could
hardly
believe
i
had
ever
had
a
room
it
constantly
reminded
me
of
my
father
he
had
opposed
my
marrying
in
the
army
as
i
suppose
most
fond
fathers
do
his
opposition
caused
me
great
suspense
and
i
thought
as
all
the
very
young
are
apt
to
that
it
was
hopeless
misery
now
that
the
struggle
was
ended
i
began
to
recall
the
arguments
of
my
parents
father
principal
one
mindful
of
the
deprivations
he
had
seen
officers
wives
endure
in
michigan
early
days
was
that
after
the
charm
and
dazzle
of
the
epaulet
had
passed
i
might
have
to
travel
in
a
covered
wagon
like
an
emigrant
i
told
this
reason
of
my
father
to
my
husband
and
he
often
laughed
over
it
when
i
was
lifted
from
my
rather
lofty
apartment
and
set
down
in
the
tent
in
the
dark
and
before
dawn
in
a
pine
forest
it
dark
the
candle
revealed
a
twinkle
in
the
eye
of
a
man
who
could
joke
before
breakfast
i
wonder
what
your
father
would
say
now
was
the
remark
while
the
silent
partner
scrabbled
around
to
get
ready
for
the
day
there
was
always
a
pervading
terror
of
being
late
and
i
could
not
believe
but
that
it
might
happen
some
day
that
thousands
of
men
would
be
kept
waiting
because
a
woman
had
lost
her
imaging
the
ignominy
of
any
of
the
little
trifles
that
delay
us
in
getting
ourselves
together
being
the
cause
of
detaining
an
expedition
in
its
morning
start
on
the
march
fortunately
the
soldiers
would
have
been
kept
in
merciful
ignorance
of
the
cause
of
the
detention
as
a
commanding
officer
is
not
obliged
to
explain
why
he
orders
the
trumpeter
to
delay
the
call
of
boots
and
saddles
but
the
chagrin
would
have
been
just
as
great
on
the
part
of
the
and
it
would
have
given
the
color
of
truth
to
the
general
occasional
declaration
that
it
is
easier
to
command
a
whole
division
of
cavalry
than
one
woman
i
made
no
protest
to
this
declaration
as
i
had
observed
even
in
those
early
days
of
my
married
life
that
in
matrimonial
experiences
the
men
that
make
open
statements
of
their
wrongs
in
rather
a
pompous
boastful
way
are
not
the
real
sufferers
pride
teaches
subtlety
in
hiding
genuine
injuries
though
i
had
a
continued
succession
of
frights
while
prowling
around
the
tent
before
day
hunting
my
things
believing
them
lost
sometimes
and
thus
being
thrown
into
wild
stampedes
i
escaped
the
mortification
of
detaining
the
command
the
frenchman
weariness
of
a
life
that
was
given
over
to
buttoning
and
unbuttoning
was
mine
and
in
the
short
time
between
reveillé
and
breakfast
i
lived
through
much
perturbation
of
mind
fearing
i
was
behind
time
and
devoutly
wished
that
women
who
followed
the
drum
could
have
been
clothed
like
the
feathered
tribe
and
ready
for
the
wing
at
a
moment
notice
on
this
expedition
i
brought
down
the
art
of
dressing
in
a
hurry
to
so
fine
a
point
that
i
could
take
my
bath
and
dress
entirely
in
seven
minutes
my
husband
timed
me
one
day
without
my
knowledge
and
i
had
the
honor
of
having
this
added
to
a
very
brief
list
of
my
attributes
as
a
soldier
there
was
a
second
recommendation
which
did
duty
as
a
mild
plaudit
for
years
afterward
when
faithful
soldiers
are
discharged
after
their
term
of
service
has
expired
they
have
papers
given
them
by
the
government
with
statements
of
their
ability
and
trustworthiness
mine
consisted
in
the
words
usually
used
in
presenting
me
to
a
friend
instead
of
referring
to
a
few
meagre
accomplishments
which
my
teachers
had
struggled
to
implant
as
is
the
fashion
of
some
exuberant
husbands
who
proudly
introduce
their
wives
to
intimate
friends
the
general
usually
said
oh
i
want
you
to
know
my
wife
she
slept
four
months
in
a
wagon
perhaps
some
people
in
the
states
may
not
realize
that
army
women
have
a
hard
time
even
in
saying
their
prayers
the
closet
that
the
new
testament
tells
us
to
frequent
is
seldom
ours
for
rarely
does
our
frugal
government
allow
us
one
in
army
quarters
large
enough
to
crowd
in
our
few
gowns
much
less
to
enter
in
and
shut
the
door
while
on
a
march
like
that
in
texas
devotions
would
be
somewhat
disturbed
when
one
kneeled
down
in
a
tent
uncertain
whether
it
would
be
on
a
centipede
or
a
horned
toad
to
say
a
prayer
undisturbed
it
was
necessary
to
wait
until
one
went
to
bed
fortunately
mine
were
brief
since
i
had
nothing
to
ask
for
as
i
believed
the
best
of
everything
on
earth
had
already
been
given
to
me
if
i
was
tired
and
fell
asleep
in
the
midst
of
my
thanks
i
could
only
hope
the
heavenly
father
would
forgive
me
i
was
often
so
exhausted
at
night
that
it
was
hard
to
keep
my
eyes
open
after
my
head
had
touched
the
pillow
especially
after
the
acquisition
of
the
blessed
feather
pillow
an
army
woman
i
love
the
most
consistent
and
honorable
of
her
sex
was
once
so
worn
out
after
a
day
of
danger
and
fatigue
on
a
march
that
she
fell
asleep
while
kneeling
beside
the
bed
in
the
room
she
occupied
saying
her
prayers
and
there
she
found
herself
still
on
her
knees
when
the
sun
wakened
her
in
the
morning
chapter
iv
marches
through
pine
forests
for
exasperating
heat
commend
me
to
a
pine
forest
those
tall
and
almost
branchless
southern
pines
were
simply
smothering
in
the
fringed
tops
the
wind
swayed
the
delicate
limbs
while
not
a
breath
descended
to
us
below
we
fumed
and
fussed
but
not
when
trying
to
find
a
spot
in
which
to
take
a
nap
if
we
put
ourselves
in
a
narrow
strip
of
shadow
made
by
the
slender
trunk
of
a
tree
remorseless
sol
followed
persistently
and
we
drowsily
dragged
ourselves
to
another
to
be
pursued
in
the
same
determined
manner
and
stared
into
instant
wakefulness
by
the
burning
rays
the
general
had
reveillé
sounded
at
in
the
morning
causing
our
scamp
to
remark
that
if
we
were
to
be
routed
out
in
the
night
he
thought
he
would
eat
his
breakfast
the
evening
before
in
order
to
save
time
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
move
before
dawn
as
the
moment
the
sun
came
in
sight
the
heat
was
suffocating
it
was
so
dark
when
we
set
out
that
it
was
with
difficulty
we
reached
the
main
road
from
our
night
camp
in
safety
my
husband
tossed
me
into
the
saddle
and
cautioned
me
to
follow
as
close
as
my
horse
could
walk
as
we
picked
our
way
over
logs
and
through
ditches
or
underbrush
custis
lee
a
was
doglike
in
his
behavior
at
these
times
he
seemed
to
aim
to
put
his
hoof
exactly
in
the
footprint
of
the
general
horse
in
times
of
difficulty
or
moments
of
peril
he
evidently
considered
that
he
was
following
the
commanding
officer
rather
than
carrying
me
i
scarcely
blamed
him
much
as
i
liked
to
control
my
own
horse
and
gladly
let
the
bridle
slacken
on
his
neck
as
he
cautiously
picked
his
circuitous
way
but
once
on
the
main
road
the
intelligent
animal
allowed
me
to
take
control
again
out
of
the
dark
my
husband
voice
came
cheerily
as
if
he
were
riding
in
a
path
of
sunshine
are
you
all
right
give
lee
his
head
trust
that
old
plug
of
yours
to
bring
you
out
this
insult
to
my
splendid
spirited
for
he
was
that
among
horses
as
well
as
by
birth
was
received
calmly
by
his
owner
especially
as
the
sagacious
animal
was
taking
better
care
of
me
than
i
could
possibly
take
of
myself
and
i
spent
a
brief
time
in
calling
out
a
defense
of
him
through
the
gloom
of
the
forest
this
little
diversion
was
indulged
in
now
and
again
by
the
general
to
provoke
an
argument
and
thus
assure
himself
that
i
was
safe
and
closely
following
and
so
it
went
on
before
day
and
after
dark
there
was
no
hour
or
circumstance
out
of
which
we
did
not
extract
some
amusement
the
nights
fortunately
were
cool
but
such
dews
fell
and
it
was
so
chilly
that
we
were
obliged
to
begin
our
morning
march
in
thick
coats
which
were
tossed
off
as
soon
as
the
sun
rose
the
dews
drenched
the
bedding
i
was
sometimes
sure
that
it
was
raining
in
the
night
and
woke
my
husband
to
ask
to
have
the
ambulance
curtains
of
our
bed
lowered
but
it
was
always
a
false
alarm
not
a
drop
of
rain
fell
in
that
blistering
august
i
soon
learned
to
shut
our
clothes
in
a
little
valise
at
night
after
undressing
in
the
tent
to
ensure
dry
linen
in
the
penetrating
dampness
of
the
morning
my
husband
lifted
me
out
of
the
wagon
when
reveillé
sounded
into
the
tent
and
by
the
light
of
a
tallow
candle
i
had
my
bath
and
got
into
my
clothes
combing
my
hair
straight
back
as
it
was
too
dark
to
part
it
then
to
keep
my
shoes
from
being
soaked
with
the
wet
grass
i
was
carried
to
the
and
lifted
upon
my
horse
afterward
one
of
my
hurried
toilets
was
stopped
short
one
morning
by
the
loss
of
the
body
of
my
in
vain
i
tossed
our
few
traps
about
to
find
it
and
finally
remembered
that
i
had
exchanged
the
waist
for
a
jacket
and
left
it
under
a
tree
where
we
had
been
taking
a
siesta
the
day
before
eliza
had
brought
in
the
blanket
books
and
hats
but
alas
for
my
dress
body
it
was
hopelessly
lost
in
a
pine
forest
dark
and
thick
with
fallen
trees
what
good
did
one
tallow
dip
do
in
the
hasty
search
we
made
a
column
of
thousands
of
men
could
not
be
detained
for
a
woman
gown
my
husband
had
asked
me
to
braid
the
sleeves
like
his
own
velvet
jacket
five
rows
of
gilt
braid
in
five
loops
made
a
dash
of
color
that
he
liked
which
though
entirely
out
of
place
in
a
thoroughfare
was
admissible
in
our
frontier
life
he
regretted
the
loss
but
insisted
on
sending
for
more
gilt
braid
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
the
wilderness
and
then
began
to
laugh
to
himself
and
wonder
if
the
traveler
that
came
after
us
not
knowing
who
had
preceded
him
might
not
think
he
had
come
upon
a
part
of
the
wardrobe
of
a
circus
troupe
it
would
have
been
rather
serious
joking
if
in
the
small
outfit
in
my
valise
i
had
not
brought
a
jacket
for
which
though
it
rendered
me
more
of
a
fright
than
sun
and
wind
had
made
me
i
still
was
very
thankful
for
without
the
happy
accident
that
brought
it
along
i
should
have
been
huddled
inside
the
closed
ambulance
waistless
and
alone
our
looks
did
not
enter
into
the
question
very
much
all
we
thought
of
was
how
to
keep
from
being
prostrated
by
the
heat
and
how
to
get
rested
after
the
march
for
the
next
day
task
we
had
a
unique
character
for
a
guide
he
was
a
citizen
of
texas
who
boasted
that
not
a
road
or
a
trail
in
the
state
was
unfamiliar
to
him
his
mule
betty
was
a
trial
she
walked
so
fast
that
no
one
could
keep
up
with
her
but
not
faster
did
she
travel
than
her
master
tongue
as
we
rode
at
the
head
of
the
column
the
sun
pouring
down
upon
our
heads
we
would
call
out
to
him
in
heaven
name
stillman
how
much
longer
is
this
to
keep
up
meaning
when
shall
we
find
a
creek
on
which
to
camp
oh
three
miles
further
you
sure
to
find
a
stream
was
his
confident
reply
and
sure
enough
the
grass
began
to
look
greener
the
moss
hung
from
the
trees
the
pines
were
varied
by
beautiful
cypress
or
some
tree
and
hope
sprang
up
in
our
hearts
the
very
horses
showed
by
quickening
step
they
knew
what
awaited
us
our
scorched
and
parched
throats
began
to
taste
in
imagination
what
was
our
idea
of
a
stream
it
was
cool
and
limpid
dancing
over
pebbles
on
its
merry
way
we
found
ourselves
in
reality
in
the
bed
of
a
dried
creek
nothing
but
pools
of
muddy
water
with
a
coating
of
green
mold
on
the
surface
the
custers
made
use
of
this
expression
the
rest
of
their
lives
if
ever
we
came
to
a
puny
crawling
driblet
of
water
they
said
this
must
be
one
of
streams
on
we
went
again
with
that
fabricator
calling
out
from
betty
back
sho
to
find
finest
water
in
the
land
five
miles
on
whenever
he
had
been
in
these
parts
afore
he
had
always
found
at
all
seasons
a
roaring
torrent
one
day
we
dragged
through
forty
miles
of
arid
land
and
after
passing
the
dried
beds
of
three
streams
the
general
was
obliged
to
camp
at
last
on
account
of
the
exhausted
horses
on
a
creek
with
pools
of
muddy
standing
water
which
stillman
coming
back
to
the
column
described
as
rather
low
this
was
our
worst
day
and
we
felt
the
heat
intensely
as
we
usually
finished
our
march
and
were
in
camp
before
the
sun
was
very
high
i
do
not
remember
one
good
drink
of
water
on
that
march
when
it
was
not
muddy
or
stagnant
it
tasted
of
the
roots
of
the
trees
some
one
had
given
my
husband
some
claret
for
me
when
we
set
out
and
but
for
that
i
do
really
know
how
the
thirst
of
the
midsummer
days
could
have
been
endured
the
general
had
already
taught
himself
not
to
drink
between
meals
and
i
was
trying
to
do
so
all
he
drank
was
his
mug
of
coffee
in
the
early
morning
and
at
dinner
and
cold
tea
or
coffee
which
eliza
kept
in
a
bottle
for
luncheon
illustration
general
custer
as
a
cadet
the
privations
did
not
quench
the
buoyancy
of
those
gay
young
fellows
the
general
and
his
staff
told
stories
and
sang
and
a
man
with
good
descriptive
powers
recounted
the
bills
of
fare
of
good
dinners
and
choice
viands
he
had
enjoyed
while
we
knew
we
had
nothing
to
anticipate
in
this
wilderness
but
army
fare
sometimes
as
we
marched
along
almost
melted
with
heat
and
our
throats
parched
for
water
the
odor
of
cucumbers
was
wafted
toward
us
stillman
the
guide
being
called
on
for
an
explanation
as
we
wondered
if
we
were
nearing
a
farm
slackened
betty
waited
for
us
and
took
down
our
hopes
by
explaining
that
it
was
a
certain
species
of
snake
which
infested
that
part
of
the
country
the
scorpions
centipedes
and
tarantulas
were
daily
encountered
i
not
only
grew
more
and
more
unwilling
to
take
my
nap
after
the
march
was
over
under
a
tree
but
made
life
a
burden
to
my
husband
till
he
gave
up
flinging
himself
down
anywhere
to
sleep
and
induced
him
to
take
his
rest
in
the
traveling
wagon
i
had
been
indolently
lying
outstretched
in
a
little
grateful
shade
one
day
when
i
was
hurriedly
roused
by
some
one
and
moved
to
avoid
what
seemed
to
me
a
small
dried
twig
it
was
the
most
venomous
of
snakes
called
the
rattlesnake
it
was
very
strange
that
we
all
escaped
being
stung
or
bitten
in
the
midst
of
thousands
of
those
poisonous
reptiles
and
insects
one
teamster
died
from
a
scorpion
bite
and
unfortunately
i
saw
his
bloated
disfigured
body
as
we
marched
by
it
lay
on
a
wagon
ready
for
burial
without
even
a
coffin
as
we
had
no
lumber
what
was
most
aggravating
were
two
pests
of
that
region
the
and
the
chigger
the
latter
bury
their
heads
under
the
skin
and
when
they
are
swollen
with
blood
it
is
almost
impossible
to
extract
them
without
leaving
the
head
imbedded
this
festers
and
the
irritation
is
almost
unbearable
if
they
see
fit
to
locate
on
neck
face
or
arms
it
is
possible
to
outwit
them
in
their
progress
but
they
generally
choose
that
unattainable
spot
between
the
shoulders
and
the
surgical
operation
of
taking
them
out
with
a
needle
or
must
devolve
upon
some
one
else
to
ride
thus
with
the
skin
on
fire
and
know
that
it
must
be
endured
till
the
march
was
ended
caused
some
grumbling
but
it
did
not
last
long
the
enemy
being
routed
out
trilled
a
song
or
laugh
from
young
and
happy
throats
if
we
came
to
a
sandy
stretch
of
ground
loud
groans
from
the
staff
began
and
a
cry
we
in
for
the
chiggers
was
an
immediate
warning
we
all
grew
very
wary
of
lying
down
to
rest
in
such
a
locality
but
were
thankful
that
the
little
pests
were
not
venomous
there
nothing
like
being
where
something
dangerous
lies
in
wait
for
you
to
teach
submission
to
what
is
only
an
irritating
inconvenience
one
of
the
small
incidents
out
of
which
we
invariably
extracted
fun
was
our
march
at
dawn
past
the
cabins
of
the
few
inhabitants
on
the
open
platform
sometimes
covered
but
often
with
no
roof
which
connects
the
two
log
huts
the
family
are
wont
to
sleep
in
hot
weather
there
they
lay
on
rude
cots
and
were
only
awakened
by
the
actual
presence
of
the
cavalry
of
whose
approach
they
were
unaware
the
children
sat
up
in
bed
in
wonder
the
grown
people
raised
their
heads
but
instantly
ducked
under
the
covers
again
thinking
they
would
get
up
in
a
moment
as
soon
as
the
cavalcade
had
passed
from
time
to
time
a
head
was
cautiously
raised
hoping
to
see
the
end
of
the
column
then
such
a
shout
from
the
soldiers
a
fusillade
of
the
wittiest
comments
such
as
only
soldiers
can
make
for
i
never
expect
to
hear
brighter
speeches
than
issue
from
a
marching
column
and
down
went
the
venturesome
head
compelled
to
obey
an
unspoken
military
mandate
and
remain
under
cover
there
these
people
lay
till
the
sun
was
scorching
them
imprisoned
under
their
by
modesty
while
the
several
thousand
men
filed
by
two
by
two
and
the
long
in
the
rear
had
passed
the
house
there
came
a
day
when
i
could
not
laugh
and
joke
with
the
rest
i
was
mortified
to
find
myself
ill
i
who
had
been
pluming
myself
on
being
such
a
good
campaigner
my
desire
to
keep
well
being
heightened
by
overhearing
the
general
boasting
to
tom
that
nothing
makes
the
old
lady
we
did
not
know
that
sleeping
in
the
sun
in
that
climate
brings
on
a
chill
and
i
had
been
frightened
away
from
the
ground
where
there
might
be
shade
to
the
wagon
for
my
afternoon
sleep
it
was
embarrassing
in
the
extreme
i
could
neither
be
sent
back
nor
remain
in
that
wilderness
which
was
infested
by
guerrillas
the
surgeon
compelled
me
to
lie
down
on
the
march
it
was
very
lonely
for
i
missed
the
laughter
and
story
at
the
head
of
the
column
which
had
lightened
the
privations
of
the
journey
the
soil
was
so
shallow
that
the
wagon
was
kept
on
a
continual
joggle
by
the
roots
of
the
trees
over
which
we
passed
this
unevenness
was
of
course
not
noticeable
on
horseback
but
now
it
was
painfully
so
at
every
revolution
of
the
wheels
the
general
and
tom
came
back
to
comfort
me
every
now
and
again
while
eliza
mammied
and
nursed
me
and
rode
in
the
seat
by
the
driver
it
was
fever
no
one
knowing
about
it
can
read
these
words
and
not
feel
a
shudder
i
believe
it
is
not
dangerous
but
the
patient
is
introduced
in
the
most
painful
manner
to
every
bone
in
his
body
incredible
as
it
used
to
seem
when
in
school
we
repeated
the
number
of
bones
it
now
became
no
longer
a
wonder
and
the
only
marvel
was
how
some
of
the
smallest
on
the
list
could
contain
so
large
an
ache
i
used
to
lie
and
speculate
how
one
slender
woman
could
possibly
conceal
so
many
bones
under
the
skin
anatomy
had
been
on
the
list
of
hated
books
in
school
but
i
began
then
to
study
it
from
life
in
a
manner
that
made
it
likely
to
be
remembered
the
surgeon
as
is
the
custom
of
the
admirable
men
of
that
profession
in
the
army
paid
me
the
strictest
attention
and
i
swallowed
quinine
it
seemed
to
me
by
the
spoonful
as
i
had
never
taken
any
medicine
to
speak
of
it
did
its
duty
quickly
and
in
a
few
days
i
was
lifted
into
the
saddle
tottering
and
but
partly
relieved
from
the
pain
and
very
glad
to
get
back
to
our
military
family
who
welcomed
me
so
warmly
that
i
was
aglow
with
gratitude
i
wished
to
ignore
the
fact
that
i
had
fallen
by
the
way
and
was
kept
in
lively
fear
that
they
would
all
vote
me
a
bother
after
that
my
husband
had
the
soldiers
who
were
detailed
for
duty
at
headquarters
when
they
cut
the
wood
for
build
a
rough
shade
of
pine
branches
over
the
wagon
when
we
reached
camp
even
that
troubled
me
though
the
fellows
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
but
the
general
quieted
me
by
explaining
that
the
men
being
excused
from
night
duty
as
sentinels
would
not
mind
building
the
shade
as
much
as
losing
their
sleep
and
besides
we
were
soon
afterward
out
of
the
pine
forest
and
on
the
prairie
our
officers
suffered
dreadfully
on
that
march
though
they
made
light
of
it
and
were
soon
merry
after
a
trial
or
hardship
was
over
the
drenching
dews
chilled
the
air
that
was
encountered
just
at
daybreak
they
were
then
plunged
into
a
steam
bath
from
the
overpowering
sun
and
the
impure
water
told
frightfully
on
their
health
i
have
seen
them
turn
pale
and
almost
reel
in
the
saddle
as
we
marched
on
they
kept
quinine
in
their
and
horrified
me
by
taking
large
quantities
at
any
hour
when
they
began
to
feel
a
chill
coming
on
or
were
especially
faint
our
brother
tom
did
not
become
quite
strong
after
his
attack
of
fever
for
a
long
time
and
had
inflammatory
rheumatism
at
fort
riley
a
year
or
more
afterward
which
the
surgeons
attributed
to
his
texas
exposure
i
used
to
see
the
haggard
face
of
the
colonel
jacob
greene
grow
drawn
and
gray
with
the
inward
fever
that
filled
his
veins
and
racked
his
bones
with
pain
the
very
hue
of
his
skin
comes
back
to
me
after
all
these
years
for
we
grieved
over
his
suffering
as
we
had
all
just
welcomed
him
back
from
the
starvation
of
libby
prison
i
rode
in
their
midst
month
after
month
ever
revolving
in
my
mind
the
question
whence
came
the
inexhaustible
supply
of
pluck
that
seemed
at
their
command
to
meet
all
trials
and
privations
just
as
their
unfaltering
courage
had
enabled
them
to
go
through
the
battles
of
the
war
and
yet
how
much
harder
it
was
to
face
such
trials
unsupported
by
the
excitement
of
the
and
the
charge
there
was
no
wild
clamor
of
war
to
enable
them
to
forget
the
absence
of
the
commonest
necessities
of
existence
in
texas
and
kansas
the
life
was
often
for
months
unattended
by
excitement
of
any
description
it
was
only
to
be
endured
by
a
grim
shutting
of
the
teeth
and
an
iron
will
the
mother
of
one
of
the
fallen
heroes
of
the
seventh
cavalry
who
passed
uncomplainingly
through
the
privations
of
the
frontier
and
gave
up
his
life
at
last
writes
to
me
in
a
recent
letter
that
she
considers
those
late
experiences
of
hardship
and
suffering
so
gallantly
borne
by
far
the
most
interesting
of
general
custer
life
and
the
least
known
for
my
part
i
was
constantly
mystified
as
i
considered
how
our
officers
coming
from
all
the
wild
enthusiasm
of
their
virginia
life
could
as
they
expressed
it
buckle
down
to
the
dull
exhausting
days
of
a
monotonous
march
young
as
i
then
was
i
thought
that
to
endure
to
fight
for
and
inflexibly
pursue
a
purpose
or
general
principle
like
patriotism
seemed
to
require
far
more
patience
and
courage
than
when
it
is
individualized
i
did
not
venture
to
put
my
thoughts
into
words
for
two
reasons
i
was
too
wary
to
let
them
think
i
acknowledged
there
were
hardships
lest
they
might
think
i
repented
having
come
for
i
knew
then
as
i
know
now
but
feared
they
did
not
that
i
would
go
through
it
all
a
hundred
times
over
if
inspired
by
the
reasons
that
actuated
me
in
the
second
place
i
had
already
found
what
a
habit
it
is
to
ridicule
and
make
light
of
misfortune
or
vicissitude
it
cut
me
to
the
quick
at
first
and
i
thought
the
officers
and
soldiers
lacking
in
sympathy
but
i
learned
to
know
what
splendid
loyal
friends
they
really
were
if
misfortune
came
and
help
was
needed
how
they
denied
themselves
to
loan
money
if
it
is
the
financial
difficulty
of
a
friend
how
they
nursed
one
another
in
illness
or
accident
how
they
quietly
fought
the
battles
of
the
absent
and
one
occasion
i
remember
that
an
officer
being
ill
was
unable
to
help
himself
when
a
soldier
behaved
in
a
most
insolent
manner
and
his
brother
officer
knocked
him
down
but
immediately
apologized
to
the
captain
for
taking
the
matter
out
of
his
hands
a
hundred
ways
of
showing
the
most
unswerving
fidelity
taught
me
as
years
went
on
to
submit
to
what
i
still
think
the
deplorable
habit
if
not
of
ridicule
of
suppressed
sympathy
i
used
to
think
that
even
if
a
misfortune
was
not
serious
it
ought
to
be
recognized
and
none
were
afraid
of
showing
that
they
possessed
truly
tender
gentle
sympathetic
natures
with
me
or
with
any
woman
that
came
among
them
the
rivers
and
even
the
small
streams
in
texas
have
high
banks
it
is
a
land
of
freshets
and
the
most
innocent
little
rill
can
rise
to
a
roaring
torrent
in
no
time
anticipating
these
crossings
we
had
in
our
train
a
pontoon
bridge
we
had
to
make
long
halts
while
this
bridge
was
being
laid
and
then
oh
the
getting
down
to
it
if
the
sun
was
high
and
the
surgeon
had
consigned
me
to
the
i
looked
down
the
deep
gulley
with
more
than
inward
quaking
my
trembling
hands
clutched
wildly
at
the
seat
and
my
head
was
out
at
the
side
to
see
my
husband
face
as
he
directed
the
descent
cautioned
the
driver
and
encouraged
me
the
brake
was
frequently
not
enough
and
the
soldiers
had
to
man
the
wheels
for
the
soil
was
wet
and
slippery
from
the
constant
passing
of
the
pioneer
force
who
had
laid
the
bridge
the
heavy
wagons
carrying
the
boats
and
lumber
for
the
bridge
had
made
the
a
difficult
bit
of
ground
to
traverse
the
four
faithful
mules
apparently
sat
down
and
slid
to
the
water
edge
but
the
driver
so
patient
with
my
quiet
imploring
to
go
slowly
kept
his
strong
foot
on
the
brake
and
knotted
the
reins
in
his
powerful
hands
i
blessed
him
for
his
caution
and
then
at
every
turn
of
the
wheel
i
implored
him
again
to
be
careful
finally
when
i
poured
out
my
thanks
at
the
safe
transit
the
color
mounted
in
his
brown
face
as
if
he
had
led
a
successful
charge
in
talking
at
night
to
eliza
of
my
tremors
as
we
plunged
down
the
bank
and
were
bounced
upon
the
pontoon
which
descended
to
the
water
edge
under
the
sudden
rush
with
which
we
came
i
added
my
praise
of
the
skill
which
she
carefully
repeated
as
she
slipped
him
on
the
sly
the
mug
of
coffee
and
hot
biscuits
with
which
she
invariably
rewarded
merit
whether
in
officers
or
men
when
i
could
i
made
these
descents
on
horseback
and
climbed
up
the
opposite
bank
with
my
hands
wound
in
custis
lee
abundant
mane
eliza
in
spite
of
her
constant
lookout
for
some
variety
for
our
table
could
seldom
find
any
vegetables
even
at
the
huts
we
passed
corn
pone
and
chine
were
the
principal
food
of
these
shiftless
citizens
in
clothing
and
complexion
indifferent
alike
to
food
and
to
drink
at
the
sabine
river
the
water
was
somewhat
clearer
the
soldiers
leading
their
horses
crossed
carefully
as
it
was
dangerous
to
stop
here
lest
the
weight
should
carry
the
bridge
under
but
they
are
too
not
to
watch
every
chance
to
procure
a
comfort
and
they
tied
strings
to
their
canteens
and
dragged
them
beside
the
bridge
getting
even
in
that
short
progress
one
tolerably
good
drink
the
was
of
course
a
long
time
in
crossing
and
dinner
looked
dubious
to
our
staff
our
faithful
eliza
as
we
talk
over
that
march
will
prove
in
her
own
language
better
than
i
can
portray
how
she
constantly
bore
our
comfort
on
her
mind
miss
libbie
do
you
mind
after
we
crossed
the
sabine
river
we
went
into
camp
well
we
had
much
supplies
and
the
wagons
was
up
so
as
i
was
for
you
all
i
says
to
the
boys
you
make
a
fire
and
i
go
the
first
thing
i
got
a
fish
well
as
long
as
my
arm
it
was
big
and
jumped
so
it
scart
me
and
i
let
the
line
go
but
one
of
the
men
caught
hold
and
jumped
for
me
and
i
had
him
and
went
to
work
on
him
right
away
i
cleaned
him
salted
him
rolled
him
in
flour
and
fried
him
and
miss
libbie
we
had
a
nice
platter
of
fish
and
the
general
was
just
delighted
when
he
came
up
and
he
was
surprised
too
and
he
found
his
dinner
for
i
had
some
cold
biscuit
and
a
bottle
of
tea
in
the
while
the
rest
was
for
the
supplies
to
come
up
for
while
all
the
rest
was
i
went
fishin
mind
you
footnote
a
my
horse
was
captured
from
a
of
general
custis
lee
during
the
war
purchased
by
my
husband
from
the
government
and
named
for
the
confederate
general
chapter
out
of
the
wilderness
as
we
came
out
of
the
forest
the
country
improved
somewhat
the
began
to
show
a
little
look
of
comfort
and
it
occurred
to
us
that
we
might
now
vary
the
monotony
of
our
fare
by
marketing
my
husband
and
i
sometimes
rode
on
in
advance
of
the
command
and
approached
the
houses
with
our
best
manners
soliciting
the
privilege
of
buying
butter
and
eggs
the
farmer
wife
was
taking
her
first
look
at
yankees
but
she
found
that
we
neither
wore
horns
nor
were
and
she
even
so
far
unbent
as
to
apologize
for
not
having
butter
adding
what
seemed
then
so
flimsy
an
excuse
that
i
do
make
more
than
enough
butter
for
our
own
use
as
we
are
only
milking
seven
cows
now
we
had
yet
to
learn
that
what
makes
a
respectable
dairy
at
home
was
nothing
in
a
country
where
the
cows
give
a
cupful
of
milk
and
all
run
to
horns
it
was
a
great
relief
to
get
out
of
the
wilderness
but
though
our
hardships
were
great
i
do
not
want
them
to
appear
to
outnumber
the
pleasures
the
absence
of
creature
comforts
is
easily
itemized
we
are
either
too
warm
or
too
cold
we
sleep
uncomfortably
we
have
poor
food
we
are
wet
by
storms
we
are
made
ill
by
exposure
happiness
can
not
be
itemized
so
readily
it
is
hard
to
define
what
goes
to
round
and
complete
a
perfect
day
we
remember
hours
of
pleasure
as
bathed
in
a
mist
that
blends
all
shades
into
a
roseate
hue
but
it
is
impossible
to
take
one
tint
from
colors
so
perfectly
mingled
and
define
how
it
adds
to
the
perfect
whole
the
days
now
seemed
to
grow
shorter
and
brighter
in
place
of
the
monotonous
pines
we
had
magnolia
mulberry
pecan
persimmon
and
as
well
as
many
of
our
own
northern
trees
that
grew
along
the
streams
the
cactus
often
four
feet
high
was
covered
with
rich
red
blossoms
and
made
spots
of
gorgeous
color
in
the
prairie
grass
i
had
not
then
seen
the
enormous
cacti
of
old
mexico
and
four
feet
of
that
plant
seemed
immense
as
at
home
we
labored
to
get
one
to
grow
six
inches
the
were
charming
in
color
variety
and
luxuriance
the
air
even
then
beginning
to
taste
of
the
sea
blew
softly
about
us
stillman
no
longer
blackened
his
soul
with
prophecies
about
the
streams
on
which
we
nightly
pitched
our
tents
the
water
did
flow
in
them
and
though
they
were
then
low
so
that
the
thousands
of
horses
were
scattered
far
up
and
down
when
came
the
green
scum
of
sluggish
pools
was
a
thing
of
the
past
a
few
days
before
we
reached
what
was
to
be
a
permanent
camp
a
rode
out
to
meet
us
and
brought
some
mail
it
was
a
strange
sensation
to
feel
ourselves
restored
by
these
letters
to
the
outside
world
general
custer
received
a
great
surprise
he
was
brevetted
major
and
in
the
regular
army
the
officers
went
off
one
side
to
read
their
sweethearts
letters
and
some
of
our
number
renewed
their
youth
sacrificed
in
that
dreadful
forest
to
fever
when
they
read
the
good
news
of
the
coming
of
their
wives
by
sea
at
hempstead
we
halted
and
the
general
made
a
permanent
camp
in
order
to
recruit
men
and
horses
after
their
exhausting
march
here
general
sheridan
and
some
of
his
staff
came
by
way
of
galveston
and
brought
with
them
our
father
custer
whom
the
general
had
sent
for
to
pay
us
a
visit
general
sheridan
expressed
great
pleasure
at
the
appearance
of
the
men
and
horses
and
heard
with
relief
and
satisfaction
of
the
orderly
manner
in
which
they
had
marched
through
the
country
of
how
few
horses
had
perished
from
the
heat
and
how
seldom
sunstroke
had
occurred
he
commended
the
general
as
he
knew
how
to
do
so
splendidly
and
placed
him
in
command
of
all
the
cavalry
in
the
state
our
own
division
then
numbered
four
thousand
men
i
was
again
mortified
to
have
to
be
compelled
to
lie
down
for
a
day
or
two
as
so
many
weeks
in
the
saddle
had
brought
me
to
the
first
discovery
of
a
spinal
column
it
was
nothing
but
sheer
fatigue
for
i
was
perfectly
well
and
could
laugh
and
talk
with
the
rest
though
not
quite
equal
to
the
effort
of
sitting
upright
especially
as
we
had
nothing
but
on
which
it
is
impossible
to
rest
indisposition
or
even
actual
illness
has
less
terrors
in
army
life
than
in
the
states
we
were
not
condemned
to
a
gloomy
upper
chamber
in
a
house
and
shut
in
alone
with
a
nurse
whom
we
had
never
before
seen
in
our
old
life
ailing
people
lay
on
a
lounge
in
the
midst
of
all
the
garrison
who
were
coming
and
going
a
dozen
times
a
day
asking
how
does
it
go
now
and
if
you
had
studied
up
anything
that
they
could
do
for
you
i
principally
recall
being
laid
up
by
fatigue
because
of
the
impetuous
assault
that
my
vehement
father
custer
made
on
his
son
for
allowing
me
to
share
the
discomforts
and
when
i
defended
my
husband
by
explaining
how
i
had
insisted
upon
coming
he
only
replied
ca
help
it
if
you
did
armstrong
you
had
no
right
to
put
her
through
such
a
jaunt
it
was
amusing
to
see
the
old
man
horror
when
our
staff
told
him
what
we
had
been
through
it
would
have
appeared
that
i
was
his
own
daughter
and
the
general
a
by
the
manner
in
which
he
renewed
his
attack
on
the
innocent
man
several
years
afterward
it
cost
lieutenant
james
calhoun
long
pleading
and
a
probationary
state
of
two
years
before
the
old
man
would
consent
to
his
taking
his
daughter
margaret
into
the
army
he
shook
his
gray
head
determinedly
and
said
oh
no
you
do
get
me
to
say
she
shall
go
through
what
libbie
has
but
the
old
gentleman
was
soon
too
busy
with
his
own
affairs
defending
himself
against
not
only
the
ingenious
attacks
of
his
two
incorrigible
boys
but
the
staff
some
of
whom
had
known
him
in
monroe
his
eyes
twinkled
and
his
face
wrinkled
itself
into
comical
smiles
as
he
came
every
morning
with
fresh
tales
of
what
a
night
of
it
he
had
put
in
he
had
a
collection
of
mild
vituperations
for
the
boys
gathered
from
maryland
ohio
and
michigan
where
he
had
lived
which
extensive
as
the
list
was
did
not
in
my
mind
half
meet
the
situation
the
stream
on
which
we
had
encamped
was
wide
and
deep
and
had
a
current
our
tents
were
on
the
bank
which
gently
sloped
to
the
water
we
had
one
open
at
both
ends
over
which
was
built
a
shade
of
pine
boughs
which
was
extended
in
front
far
enough
for
a
porch
some
lumber
from
a
pontoon
bridge
was
made
into
the
unusual
luxury
of
a
floor
my
husband
still
indulged
my
desire
to
have
the
at
the
rear
so
that
i
might
take
up
a
safe
position
at
night
when
sleep
interrupted
my
vigils
over
the
insects
and
reptiles
that
were
about
us
constantly
the
with
another
shade
over
it
was
near
us
where
eliza
flourished
a
skillet
as
usual
the
staff
were
at
some
distance
down
the
bank
while
the
division
was
stretched
along
the
stream
having
at
last
plenty
of
water
beyond
us
fifty
miles
of
prairie
stretched
out
to
the
sea
we
encamped
on
an
unused
part
of
the
plantation
of
the
oldest
resident
of
texas
who
came
forth
with
a
welcome
and
offers
of
hospitality
which
we
declined
as
our
camp
was
comfortable
his
wife
sent
me
over
a
few
things
to
make
our
tent
habitable
as
i
suppose
her
husband
told
her
that
our
furniture
consisted
of
a
bucket
and
two
there
no
denying
that
i
sank
down
into
one
of
the
chairs
which
had
a
back
with
a
sense
of
enjoyment
of
what
seemed
to
me
the
greatest
luxury
i
had
ever
known
the
milk
vegetables
roast
of
mutton
jelly
and
other
things
which
she
also
sent
were
not
enough
to
tempt
me
out
of
the
delightful
hollow
from
which
i
thought
i
never
could
emerge
again
but
military
despots
pick
up
their
families
and
carry
them
out
to
their
dinner
if
they
refuse
to
walk
the
new
neighbors
offered
us
a
room
with
them
but
the
general
never
left
his
men
and
it
is
superfluous
to
say
that
i
thought
our
clean
new
hospital
tent
as
large
again
as
a
and
much
higher
was
palatial
after
the
trials
of
the
pine
forests
the
old
neighbor
continued
his
kindness
which
was
returned
by
sending
him
game
after
the
general
hunt
and
protecting
his
estate
he
had
owned
slaves
with
forty
in
his
house
he
gave
us
dogs
and
sent
us
vegetables
and
spent
many
hours
under
our
shade
he
had
lived
under
eight
governments
in
his
texas
experience
and
possibly
the
habit
of
speeding
the
parting
and
welcoming
the
coming
guest
had
something
to
do
with
his
hospitality
i
did
not
realize
how
texas
had
been
tossed
about
in
a
game
of
and
till
he
told
me
of
his
life
under
mexican
rule
the
confederacy
and
the
united
states
i
find
mention
in
an
old
letter
to
my
parents
of
a
great
luxury
that
here
appeared
and
quote
the
words
of
the
exuberant
and
girl
missive
i
rejoice
to
tell
you
that
i
am
the
happy
possessor
of
a
mattress
it
is
made
of
the
moss
which
festoons
the
branches
of
all
the
trees
at
the
south
the
moss
is
prepared
by
boiling
it
then
burying
it
in
the
ground
for
a
long
time
till
only
the
small
thread
inside
is
left
and
this
looks
like
an
old
darkey
furnished
the
moss
for
three
dollars
and
the
whole
thing
only
cost
seven
dollars
very
cheap
for
this
country
we
are
living
finely
now
we
get
plenty
of
eggs
butter
lard
and
chickens
eliza
cooks
better
than
ever
by
a
few
logs
with
and
she
has
been
washing
this
past
week
and
drying
her
things
on
a
line
tied
to
the
and
on
bushes
and
ironing
on
the
ground
with
her
held
down
by
a
stone
on
each
corner
we
are
dressed
in
white
she
invites
us
to
mark
sunday
by
the
luxury
of
wearing
white
her
miss
used
to
we
are
regulated
by
the
doings
of
that
miss
and
i
am
glad
that
among
the
characteristics
of
my
venerable
predecessor
which
we
are
expected
to
follow
wearing
white
gowns
is
included
eliza
sitting
here
beside
me
has
just
reminded
me
of
that
week
as
it
was
marked
in
her
memory
by
a
catastrophe
eliza
misfortunes
were
usually
within
the
confines
of
domestic
routine
i
quote
her
words
it
was
on
the
gros
creek
miss
libbie
that
i
had
out
that
big
wash
and
all
your
things
and
all
the
ginnel
white
linen
pants
and
coats
i
did
know
nothin
the
high
winds
then
but
i
ai
like
to
forget
ever
again
the
first
thing
i
i
knew
the
line
was
jest
lifted
up
and
the
clothes
jest
spread
in
every
direction
and
i
jest
stood
still
and
looked
at
and
i
says
texas
how
long
am
i
to
contend
with
this
with
hands
uplifted
and
a
roll
in
her
eyes
but
i
had
to
go
to
work
and
pick
all
up
some
fell
in
the
sand
and
some
on
the
grass
i
gathered
all
with
the
sun
boiling
down
hot
enough
to
cook
an
egg
while
i
was
up
the
ginnel
was
in
the
tent
entrance
wipin
down
his
moustache
like
he
did
when
he
did
want
us
to
see
him
laughin
well
miss
libbie
i
was
mad
when
he
hollered
out
to
me
eliza
you
got
a
thar
oh
i
was
so
mad
and
hot
but
he
jest
bust
right
out
laughin
but
there
was
anything
to
do
but
rinse
and
hang
up
again
we
had
been
in
camp
but
a
short
time
when
the
daughter
of
the
newly
appointed
collector
of
the
port
came
from
their
plantation
near
to
see
us
she
invited
me
to
make
my
home
with
them
while
we
remained
but
i
was
quite
sure
there
was
nothing
on
earth
equal
to
our
camp
the
father
had
been
a
union
man
during
the
war
and
was
hopelessly
invalided
by
a
long
political
imprisonment
i
remember
nothing
bitter
or
even
gloomy
about
that
hospitable
delightful
family
the
young
girl
visit
was
the
precursor
of
many
more
and
our
young
officers
were
in
clover
there
were
three
young
women
in
the
family
and
they
came
to
our
camp
and
rode
and
drove
with
us
while
we
made
our
first
acquaintance
with
southern
home
life
the
house
was
always
full
of
guests
the
large
was
not
long
enough
however
unless
placed
diagonally
across
the
and
it
was
sometimes
laid
three
times
before
all
had
dined
the
upper
part
of
the
house
was
divided
by
a
hall
running
the
length
of
the
house
on
one
side
the
women
and
their
guests
usually
a
lot
of
rollicking
girls
were
quartered
while
the
men
visitors
had
rooms
opposite
and
then
i
first
saw
the
manner
in
which
a
southern
gallant
comes
as
a
suitor
or
a
friend
he
rode
up
to
the
house
with
his
servant
on
another
horse
carrying
a
portmanteau
they
came
to
stay
several
weeks
i
wondered
that
there
was
ever
an
uncongenial
marriage
in
the
south
when
a
man
had
such
a
chance
to
see
his
sweetheart
this
was
one
of
the
usages
of
the
country
that
our
northern
men
adopted
when
they
could
get
leave
to
be
absent
from
camp
and
delightful
visits
we
all
had
it
seemed
a
great
privilege
to
be
again
with
women
after
the
long
season
in
which
i
had
only
eliza
to
represent
the
sex
but
i
lost
my
presence
of
mind
when
i
went
into
a
room
for
the
first
time
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
myself
in
a
mirror
the
only
glass
i
had
brought
from
the
east
was
broken
early
in
the
march
and
i
had
made
my
toilet
by
feeling
the
shock
of
the
apparition
comes
back
to
me
afresh
and
the
memory
is
emphasized
by
my
fastidious
mother
horror
when
she
saw
me
afterward
i
had
nothing
but
a
hat
with
which
to
contend
against
a
texas
sun
my
face
was
almost
parboiled
and
swollen
with
sunburn
while
my
hair
was
faded
and
rough
of
course
when
i
caught
the
first
glimpse
of
myself
in
the
glass
i
instantly
hurried
to
the
general
and
tom
and
cried
out
indignantly
why
did
you
tell
me
how
horridly
i
looked
the
inconsistent
woman
in
me
forgetting
that
it
would
not
have
made
my
ugliness
any
easier
to
endure
my
husband
hung
his
head
in
assumed
humility
when
he
returned
me
to
my
mother
six
months
later
my
complexion
seemingly
hopelessly
thickened
and
darkened
for
though
happily
it
improved
after
living
in
a
house
it
never
again
looked
as
it
did
before
the
texas
life
my
indignant
mother
looked
as
if
her
was
guilty
of
an
unpardonable
crime
i
told
her
rather
flippantly
that
it
had
been
offered
up
on
the
altar
of
my
country
and
she
ought
to
be
glad
to
have
so
patriotic
a
family
but
she
withered
the
general
with
a
look
that
spoke
volumes
he
took
the
first
opportunity
to
whisper
condescendingly
that
though
my
mother
was
ready
to
disown
me
and
quite
prepared
to
annihilate
him
he
would
endeavor
not
to
cast
me
off
if
i
was
black
and
would
try
to
like
me
notwithstanding
all
the
planters
about
the
country
began
to
seek
out
the
general
and
invite
him
to
go
hunting
and
as
there
was
but
little
to
do
while
the
command
was
recruiting
from
the
march
he
took
his
father
and
the
staff
and
went
to
the
different
plantations
where
the
meet
was
planned
the
start
was
made
long
before
day
and
breakfast
was
served
at
the
house
where
the
hunters
assembled
dinner
being
enjoyed
at
the
same
hospitable
board
on
the
return
at
night
each
planter
brought
his
hounds
and
i
remember
the
general
delight
at
his
first
sight
of
the
different
packs
dogs
in
all
and
his
enthusiasm
at
finding
that
every
dog
responded
to
his
master
horn
he
thereupon
purchased
a
horn
and
practiced
in
camp
until
he
nearly
split
his
cheeks
in
twain
not
to
mention
the
spasms
into
which
we
were
driven
for
his
five
hounds
presents
from
the
farmers
ranged
themselves
in
an
admiring
and
sympathetic
semicircle
accompanying
all
his
practicing
by
tuning
their
voices
until
they
reached
the
same
key
i
had
no
idea
it
was
such
a
difficult
thing
to
learn
to
sound
notes
on
a
horn
when
we
begged
off
sometimes
from
the
impromptu
serenades
of
the
hunter
and
his
dogs
the
answer
was
i
am
obliged
to
practice
for
if
anyone
thinks
it
is
an
easy
thing
to
blow
on
a
horn
just
let
him
try
it
of
course
tom
caught
the
fever
and
came
in
one
day
with
the
polished
horn
of
a
texas
steer
ready
for
action
the
two
were
impervious
to
ridicule
no
detailed
description
of
their
red
distended
cheeks
bulging
eyes
bent
and
laborious
forms
as
they
struggled
suspended
the
operation
the
early
stages
of
this
horn
music
gave
little
idea
of
the
gay
picture
of
these
debonair
and
spirited
athletes
as
they
afterward
appeared
when
their
musical
education
was
completed
they
were
wont
to
leap
into
the
saddle
lift
the
horn
in
unconscious
grace
to
their
lips
curbing
their
excited
and
rearing
horses
with
the
free
hand
and
dash
away
amidst
the
frantic
leaping
barking
and
joyous
demonstration
of
their
dogs
at
the
first
hunt
when
one
of
our
number
killed
a
deer
the
farmers
made
known
to
our
officers
on
the
sly
the
old
established
custom
of
the
chase
while
captain
lyon
stood
over
his
game
volubly
narrating
in
excited
tones
how
the
shot
had
been
sent
and
where
it
had
entered
a
signal
which
he
was
too
absorbed
to
notice
was
given
and
the
crowd
rushed
upon
him
and
so
plastered
him
with
blood
from
the
deer
that
scarcely
an
inch
of
his
hair
hands
and
face
was
spared
while
his
garments
were
red
from
neck
to
toes
after
this
baptism
of
gore
they
dragged
him
to
our
tent
on
their
return
to
exhibit
him
and
it
was
well
that
he
was
one
of
the
fellows
in
the
world
for
day
and
night
these
pestering
fellows
kept
up
the
joke
notwithstanding
he
had
been
subjected
to
the
custom
of
the
country
which
demands
that
the
blood
of
the
first
deer
killed
in
the
chase
shall
anoint
the
hunter
he
had
glory
enough
through
his
success
to
enable
him
to
submit
to
the
penalty
tom
also
shot
a
deer
that
day
but
his
glory
was
dimmed
by
a
misfortune
of
which
he
seemed
fated
never
to
hear
the
last
the
custom
was
to
place
one
or
two
men
at
stated
intervals
in
different
parts
of
the
country
where
the
deer
were
pretty
sure
to
run
and
tom
was
on
stand
watching
through
the
woods
in
the
direction
from
which
the
sound
of
the
dogs
came
as
the
deer
bounded
toward
him
he
was
so
excited
that
when
he
fired
the
shot
went
harmlessly
by
the
buck
and
landed
in
one
of
the
general
dogs
killing
the
poor
hound
instantly
though
this
was
a
loss
keenly
felt
there
was
no
resisting
the
chance
to
guy
the
hunter
even
after
tom
had
come
to
be
one
of
the
best
shots
in
the
seventh
cavalry
and
when
the
general
never
went
hunting
without
him
if
he
could
help
it
he
continued
to
say
oh
tom
a
good
shot
a
sure
aim
he
sure
to
hit
something
tom
was
very
apt
also
to
find
newspaper
clippings
laid
around
with
apparent
carelessness
by
his
brother
where
he
would
see
them
for
example
like
this
one
which
i
have
kept
among
some
old
letters
as
a
reminder
of
those
merry
days
an
editor
went
hunting
the
other
day
for
the
first
time
in
years
and
he
was
lucky
enough
to
bring
down
an
old
farmer
by
a
shot
in
the
leg
the
distance
was
yards
we
had
long
and
delightful
rides
over
the
level
country
sometimes
my
husband
and
i
riding
quietly
along
at
twilight
for
the
days
were
still
too
warm
for
much
exercise
at
came
upon
as
many
as
three
coveys
of
quail
scurrying
to
the
underbrush
in
a
short
walk
from
camp
he
could
bag
a
dozen
birds
and
we
had
plenty
of
duck
in
the
creek
near
us
the
bird
dog
was
a
perpetual
pleasure
she
was
the
dearest
chummiest
sort
of
and
when
we
took
her
out
she
still
visited
with
us
perpetually
running
to
us
every
now
and
again
to
utter
a
little
whine
or
to
have
us
witness
her
tail
which
in
her
excitement
in
rushing
through
the
underbrush
cacti
and
weeds
was
usually
scratched
torn
and
bleeding
the
country
was
so
dry
that
we
could
roam
at
will
regardless
of
roads
our
horses
were
accustomed
to
fording
streams
pushing
their
way
through
thickets
and
brambles
and
becoming
so
interested
in
making
a
route
through
them
that
my
habit
sometimes
caught
in
the
briars
and
my
hat
was
lifted
off
by
the
moss
and
branches
and
if
i
was
not
very
watchful
the
horse
would
go
through
a
passage
between
two
trees
just
wide
enough
for
himself
and
rub
me
off
unless
i
scrambled
to
the
pommel
the
greater
the
obstacles
my
husband
encountered
even
in
his
sports
the
more
pleasure
it
was
to
him
his
own
horses
were
so
trained
that
he
shot
from
their
backs
without
their
moving
mine
would
also
stand
fire
and
at
the
report
of
a
gun
behaved
much
better
than
his
mistress
eliza
instead
of
finding
the
general
wearing
his
white
linen
to
celebrate
sunday
according
to
her
observances
was
apt
to
get
it
on
after
far
too
often
to
suit
her
on
the
sabbath
she
was
immensely
puffed
up
to
see
him
emerge
from
the
tent
speckless
and
spotless
because
she
said
to
me
whilst
the
rest
of
the
officers
is
only
too
glad
to
get
a
white
shirt
the
ginnel
walks
out
among
all
in
linen
from
top
to
toe
she
has
been
sitting
beside
me
talking
over
a
day
at
that
time
do
you
mind
miss
libbie
that
while
we
was
down
in
texas
the
ginnel
was
startin
off
on
a
i
jest
went
up
to
him
and
tole
him
ginnel
you
go
take
off
them
there
white
pants
he
said
so
quiet
sassy
cool
deer
always
like
something
white
telling
me
that
jest
he
wanted
to
keep
on
well
he
went
all
the
same
and
when
he
came
back
i
says
think
the
deer
saw
you
in
those
pants
he
was
covered
with
and
mud
and
a
young
fawn
swinging
across
the
saddle
but
them
pants
was
mud
and
blood
and
green
and
yellow
blotches
from
hem
to
bindin
but
he
jest
laughed
at
me
because
i
was
and
brought
the
deer
out
to
me
and
i
skinned
it
the
fust
time
i
ever
did
and
cooked
it
next
day
and
we
had
a
nice
dinner
at
that
time
eliza
was
a
famous
belle
our
colored
coachman
henry
was
a
permanent
fixture
at
the
foot
of
her
throne
while
the
darkeys
on
the
neighboring
plantations
came
nightly
to
worship
she
bore
her
honors
becomingly
as
well
as
the
fact
that
she
was
the
proud
possessor
of
a
showy
outfit
including
silk
dresses
the
soldiers
to
whom
eliza
had
been
kind
in
virginia
had
given
her
clothes
that
they
had
found
in
the
caches
where
the
farmers
endeavored
to
hide
their
valuables
during
the
war
eliza
had
made
one
of
these
very
receptacles
for
her
ole
miss
before
she
left
the
plantation
and
while
her
conscience
allowed
her
to
take
the
silken
finery
of
some
other
woman
whom
she
did
not
know
she
kept
the
secret
of
the
of
her
own
people
valuables
until
after
the
war
when
the
general
sent
her
home
in
charge
of
one
of
his
sergeants
to
pay
a
visit
even
the
old
mistress
did
not
know
the
spot
that
eliza
had
chosen
which
had
been
for
years
a
secret
and
she
describes
the
joy
at
sight
of
her
and
her
going
to
the
place
in
the
field
and
digging
up
the
property
with
right
smart
of
money
too
miss
libbie
enough
with
that
the
ginnel
gave
me
to
take
home
to
keep
till
the
crops
could
be
harvested
this
finery
of
eliza
drove
a
woman
servant
at
the
next
place
to
plan
a
miserable
revenge
which
came
near
sending
us
all
into
another
world
we
were
taking
our
breakfast
one
morning
with
the
table
spread
under
the
awning
in
front
of
our
tent
the
air
not
yet
heated
by
the
sun
came
over
the
prairie
from
the
sea
the
little
green
swift
and
the
chameleon
which
the
general
had
found
in
the
arbor
roof
and
tamed
as
pets
looked
down
upon
as
reposeful
and
pretty
a
scene
as
one
could
wish
when
we
suddenly
discovered
a
blaze
in
the
where
we
had
now
a
stove
but
eliza
shall
tell
the
story
when
i
fust
saw
the
fire
miss
libbie
i
was
on
you
at
breakfast
then
the
first
thought
was
the
ginnel
and
i
jest
dropped
everythin
and
ran
and
found
the
blaze
was
up
the
canvas
of
my
tent
nearly
the
powder
the
can
had
two
handles
and
i
ketched
it
up
and
ran
outside
when
i
first
got
in
the
tent
it
had
burnt
clar
up
to
the
on
one
side
some
things
in
my
trunk
was
scorched
mightily
and
one
side
of
it
was
pretty
well
burnt
the
fire
was
started
right
behind
my
trunk
not
very
near
the
the
ginnel
said
to
me
how
cool
and
deliberate
i
was
and
he
told
me
right
away
that
if
my
things
had
been
destroyed
i
would
have
everythin
replaced
for
he
was
bound
i
was
going
to
lose
nothin
my
husband
in
this
emergency
was
as
cool
as
he
always
was
he
followed
eliza
as
she
ran
for
the
and
saved
the
tent
and
its
contents
from
destruction
and
without
doubt
saved
our
lives
the
noble
part
that
i
bore
in
the
moment
of
peril
was
to
take
a
safe
position
in
our
tent
wring
my
hands
and
cry
if
there
was
no
one
else
to
rush
forward
in
moments
of
danger
courage
came
unexpectedly
but
i
do
not
recall
much
brave
volunteering
on
my
part
eliza
put
such
a
broad
interpretation
upon
the
general
instruction
not
to
let
any
needy
person
go
away
from
our
tent
or
quarters
hungry
that
occasionally
we
had
to
protest
she
describes
to
me
now
his
telling
her
she
was
carrying
her
benevolence
rather
too
far
and
her
replying
yes
ginnel
i
do
take
in
some
one
and
a
and
yes
he
replied
to
me
more
on
than
off
i
should
say
one
chile
i
had
to
hide
in
the
weeds
a
week
miss
libbie
the
ginnel
used
to
come
out
to
the
and
stand
there
kinder
careless
like
and
he
would
spy
a
little
path
running
out
into
the
weeds
well
he
used
to
carry
me
high
and
dry
about
them
little
roads
leading
off
to
folks
he
said
i
was
i
would
say
when
i
saw
him
lookin
at
the
little
path
in
the
weeds
what
is
it
ginnel
he
would
look
at
me
so
out
of
his
eyes
and
say
what
say
then
he
say
he
was
goin
to
get
a
couple
of
bloodhounds
and
run
through
the
bushes
to
find
out
just
how
many
i
was
then
miss
libbie
we
never
did
come
to
a
brush
or
a
thicket
but
that
he
would
look
around
at
me
so
kinder
sly
like
and
tell
me
that
would
be
a
ranch
for
me
then
i
would
say
it
a
good
thing
i
do
have
somebody
sometimes
my
is
allus
stuck
way
off
by
itself
and
it
lonesome
and
sometimes
i
so
scart
but
you
know
miss
libbie
she
added
afraid
i
might
think
she
reflected
on
one
whose
memory
she
reveres
my
tent
was
obliged
to
be
a
good
bit
off
the
smell
of
the
cookin
took
away
the
ginnel
appetite
he
was
so
uncertain
like
in
his
eatin
you
remember
illustration
in
texas
two
wretched
little
ragamuffins
one
of
the
poor
white
trash
and
another
a
negro
were
kept
skulking
about
the
making
long
circuitous
détours
to
the
creek
for
water
for
fear
we
would
see
them
as
they
said
miss
lize
tole
us
you
make
a
scatter
if
you
knew
chillern
was
fed
at
the
they
slipped
into
the
underbrush
at
our
approach
and
lay
low
in
the
grass
at
the
rear
of
the
tent
if
they
heard
our
voices
the
general
at
first
thought
that
after
eliza
had
thoroughly
stuffed
them
and
made
them
fetch
and
carry
for
her
they
would
disappear
and
so
chose
to
ignore
their
presence
pretending
he
had
not
seen
them
but
at
last
they
appeared
to
be
a
permanent
addition
and
we
concluded
that
the
best
plan
would
be
to
acknowledge
their
presence
and
make
the
best
of
the
infliction
so
we
named
one
texas
and
the
other
jeff
eliza
beamed
and
told
the
orphans
who
capered
out
boldly
in
sight
for
the
first
time
and
ran
after
miss
lize
to
do
her
bidding
both
of
them
from
being
starved
wretched
and
dull
grew
quite
peart
under
her
care
the
first
evidence
of
gratitude
i
had
was
the
creeping
into
the
tent
of
the
little
white
boy
with
downcast
eyes
mumbling
that
miss
lize
said
that
i
could
pick
the
scorpions
out
of
your
shoes
i
asked
in
wonder
one
spark
of
generosity
blazing
up
before
its
final
obliteration
and
how
in
the
name
of
mercy
do
you
get
on
with
the
things
yourself
he
lifted
up
a
diminutive
heel
and
proudly
showed
me
a
scar
the
boy
had
probably
never
had
on
a
pair
of
shoes
consequently
this
part
of
his
pedal
extremity
was
absolutely
so
callous
so
evidently
obdurate
to
any
object
less
penetrating
than
a
sharpened
spike
driven
in
with
a
hammer
i
found
myself
wondering
how
a
scorpion
little
spear
could
have
effected
an
entrance
through
the
seemingly
impervious
outer
cuticle
finally
i
concluded
that
at
a
more
tender
age
that
too
solid
flesh
may
have
been
susceptible
to
an
honorable
wound
it
turned
out
that
this
cowed
and
apparently
lifeless
little
midget
was
perfectly
indifferent
to
scorpions
by
this
time
i
no
longer
pretended
to
courage
of
any
sort
i
had
found
one
in
my
trunk
and
if
after
that
i
was
compelled
to
go
to
it
i
flung
up
the
lid
ran
to
the
other
side
of
the
tent
and
with
that
eminently
senseless
feminine
call
which
is
used
alike
for
cows
geese
or
any
of
these
acknowledged
foes
doubtless
a
bear
would
be
greeted
with
the
same
word
until
the
supposed
occupants
had
run
off
night
and
morning
my
husband
shook
and
beat
my
clothes
while
he
helped
me
to
dress
the
officers
daily
came
in
with
stories
of
the
trick
so
common
to
the
venomous
reptiles
of
hiding
between
the
sheets
and
the
general
then
even
shook
the
bedding
in
our
eyrie
room
in
the
wagon
of
all
this
he
was
relieved
by
the
boy
that
eliza
called
poor
little
picked
sparrow
who
was
appointed
as
my
maid
night
and
morning
the
yellow
dot
ran
his
hands
into
shoes
stockings
and
in
all
the
places
where
the
scorpions
love
to
lurk
and
i
bravely
and
generously
gathered
myself
into
the
armchair
while
the
search
went
on
eliza
has
been
reminding
me
of
our
daily
terror
of
the
creeping
venomous
enemy
of
those
hot
lands
she
says
one
day
miss
libbie
i
got
a
bite
and
i
squalled
out
to
the
ginnel
bit
me
the
ginnel
he
said
you
bit
you
whar
i
says
my
arm
and
miss
libbie
it
was
pizen
for
my
arm
it
just
swelled
enormous
and
got
all
up
in
lumps
then
it
pained
me
so
the
ginnel
stopped
and
sent
for
the
doctor
and
he
giv
me
a
drink
of
whiskey
then
what
do
you
think
when
i
got
better
did
he
go
and
say
i
was
playin
off
on
him
just
to
get
a
big
drink
of
whiskey
but
i
to
you
miss
libbie
i
was
bad
off
that
night
the
centipede
had
crept
into
my
bedclothes
and
got
a
good
chance
at
me
i
can
tell
you
our
surgeon
was
a
naturalist
and
studied
up
the
vipers
and
venomous
insects
of
that
almost
tropical
land
he
showed
me
a
captured
scorpion
one
day
and
to
make
me
more
vigilant
infuriated
the
loathsome
creature
till
it
flung
its
javelin
of
a
tail
over
on
its
back
and
stung
itself
to
death
legends
of
what
had
happened
to
army
women
who
had
disregarded
the
injunctions
for
safety
were
handed
down
from
elder
to
subaltern
and
a
plebe
fell
heir
to
these
stories
as
much
as
to
the
tactics
imparted
by
his
superiors
or
the
campaigning
lore
i
hardly
know
when
i
first
heard
of
the
unfortunate
woman
who
lingered
too
far
behind
the
cavalcade
in
riding
for
pleasure
or
marching
and
was
captured
by
the
indians
but
for
ten
years
her
story
was
related
to
me
by
officers
of
all
ages
and
all
branches
of
the
service
as
a
warning
in
texas
the
lady
who
had
been
frightfully
stung
by
a
centipede
pointed
every
moral
the
sting
was
inflicted
before
the
war
and
in
the
far
back
days
of
angel
sleeves
which
fell
away
from
the
arm
to
the
shoulder
though
this
misfortune
dated
back
from
such
a
distant
period
the
young
officers
in
citing
her
as
a
warning
to
us
to
be
careful
described
the
red
marks
all
the
way
up
the
arm
with
as
much
fidelity
as
if
they
had
seen
them
no
one
would
have
dreamed
that
the
story
had
filtered
through
so
many
channels
but
surely
one
needed
little
warning
of
the
centipede
once
seen
it
made
as
red
stains
on
the
memory
as
on
the
beautiful
historic
arm
that
was
used
to
frighten
us
the
arabs
call
it
the
mother
of
alluding
to
the
legs
and
the
swift
manner
in
which
it
propels
itself
over
the
ground
aided
by
eight
or
nine
times
as
many
feet
as
are
allotted
to
ordinary
reptiles
makes
one
habitually
place
himself
in
a
position
for
a
quick
jump
or
flight
while
campaigning
in
texas
we
had
to
be
watchful
all
the
time
we
were
in
the
south
even
in
winter
when
wood
was
brought
in
and
laid
down
beside
the
fireplace
the
scorpions
torpid
with
cold
at
first
crawled
out
of
knots
and
crevices
and
made
a
scattering
till
they
were
captured
one
of
my
friends
was
stationed
at
a
post
where
the
quarters
were
old
and
of
adobe
and
had
been
used
during
the
war
for
stables
by
the
confederates
it
was
of
no
use
to
try
to
exterminate
these
reptiles
they
run
so
swiftly
it
takes
a
deft
hand
and
a
sure
stroke
to
finish
them
up
our
officers
grew
expert
in
devising
means
to
protect
themselves
and
in
this
instance
a
box
of
moist
mud
with
a
shingle
all
ready
was
kept
in
the
quarters
when
a
tarantula
showed
himself
he
was
plastered
on
the
wall
it
is
impossible
to
describe
how
loathsome
that
great
spider
is
the
round
body
and
long
legs
are
covered
with
hairs
each
particular
hair
visible
and
the
satanic
eyes
bulge
out
as
they
come
on
in
your
direction
making
a
feature
of
every
nightmare
for
a
long
time
after
they
are
first
seen
the
wife
of
an
officer
to
keep
these
horrors
from
dropping
on
her
bed
as
they
ran
over
the
ceiling
had
a
sheet
fastened
at
the
four
corners
and
let
down
from
the
rough
rafters
to
catch
all
invaders
and
thus
insured
herself
undisturbed
sleep
officers
all
watch
and
guard
the
women
who
share
their
hardships
even
the
young
unmarried
men
the
bachelor
officers
as
they
are
called
patterning
after
their
elders
soon
fall
into
a
sort
of
fatherly
fashion
of
looking
out
for
the
comfort
and
safety
of
the
women
they
are
with
whether
old
or
young
pretty
or
ugly
it
often
happens
that
a
comrade
going
on
a
scout
gives
his
wife
into
their
charge
i
think
of
a
hundred
kindly
deeds
shown
to
all
of
us
on
the
frontier
and
i
have
known
of
acts
so
delicate
that
i
can
hardly
refer
to
them
with
sufficient
tact
and
wish
i
might
write
with
a
tuft
of
in
the
instance
of
some
very
young
women
with
hearts
so
pure
and
souls
so
spotless
they
could
not
for
one
moment
imagine
there
lived
on
earth
people
depraved
enough
to
question
all
acts
no
matter
how
harmless
in
themselves
i
have
known
a
little
word
of
caution
to
be
spoken
regarding
some
exuberance
of
conduct
that
arose
from
the
excess
of
a
thoughtless
joyous
heart
the
husband
who
returned
to
his
wife
could
thank
the
friend
who
had
watched
over
his
interests
no
more
deeply
than
the
wife
who
owed
her
escape
from
criticism
to
his
timely
word
and
sometimes
when
we
went
into
the
states
or
were
at
a
post
with
strange
officers
it
would
not
occur
to
us
gay
and
thoughtless
as
we
were
that
we
must
consider
that
we
were
not
among
those
with
whom
we
had
summered
and
wintered
and
the
freedom
and
absolute
naturalness
of
manner
that
arose
from
our
long
and
intimate
relationship
in
isolated
posts
ought
perhaps
to
give
way
to
more
formal
conduct
if
the
women
said
to
the
men
now
we
are
among
strangers
do
you
not
think
they
would
misunderstand
our
dancing
or
driving
or
walking
together
just
as
fearlessly
as
at
home
that
was
sufficient
the
men
said
sure
enough
it
never
occurred
to
me
by
jove
i
wish
we
were
back
where
a
fellow
need
not
be
hampered
by
having
every
act
questioned
and
then
no
one
sought
harder
or
more
carefully
so
to
act
that
we
might
satisfy
the
exactions
of
that
censorious
group
of
elderly
women
who
sat
in
hotel
parlors
looking
on
and
remarking
we
did
not
do
so
when
we
were
girls
or
even
some
old
frump
in
a
garrison
we
visited
who
having
squeezed
dry
her
orange
of
life
was
determined
that
others
should
get
no
good
out
of
theirs
if
she
could
insert
one
drop
of
gall
occasionally
the
young
officers
perhaps
too
timid
to
venture
on
a
personal
suggestion
sent
us
word
by
roundabout
ways
that
they
did
not
want
us
to
continue
to
cultivate
someone
of
whom
we
knew
nothing
save
that
he
was
agreeable
how
my
husband
thanked
them
he
walked
the
floor
with
his
hands
behind
him
moved
so
that
his
voice
was
unsteady
and
said
his
say
about
what
he
owed
to
men
who
would
not
let
a
woman
they
valued
be
even
associated
with
anyone
who
might
reflect
on
them
he
was
a
and
not
being
with
those
who
daily
congregated
at
the
sutler
store
the
real
of
a
garrison
he
heard
but
little
of
what
was
going
on
a
man
is
supposed
to
be
the
custodian
of
his
own
household
in
civil
life
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
our
life
a
husband
had
often
to
leave
a
young
and
inexperienced
bride
to
the
care
of
his
comrades
while
he
went
off
for
months
of
field
duty
the
grateful
tears
rise
now
in
my
eyes
at
the
recollection
of
men
who
guarded
us
from
the
very
semblance
of
evil
as
if
we
had
been
their
sisters
chapter
vi
a
texas
norther
we
had
not
been
long
in
our
camp
at
hempstead
before
the
wives
of
two
of
the
staff
arrived
by
way
of
galveston
their
tents
were
put
on
a
line
with
or
near
ours
and
arbors
built
over
them
one
of
these
women
greene
had
been
one
of
my
dearest
girlhood
friends
and
every
pleasure
of
my
happy
life
was
enhanced
by
the
presence
of
this
lovely
woman
we
all
went
out
after
the
heat
of
the
day
on
long
rides
about
the
country
our
father
custer
was
a
fine
rider
and
not
only
sat
his
horse
well
but
it
was
almost
impossible
to
unseat
him
he
grew
more
wary
and
watchful
of
his
tormenting
sons
every
day
if
they
halted
apparently
only
to
say
a
casual
word
or
so
to
their
paternal
that
keen
old
man
spurred
his
horse
to
one
side
with
the
agility
of
a
just
in
time
to
avoid
the
flying
heels
of
the
horse
of
his
offspring
in
front
of
him
which
had
been
taught
to
fling
his
hoofs
up
when
touched
just
back
of
the
saddle
if
both
boys
came
together
and
rode
one
on
each
side
of
him
he
looked
uneasily
from
one
to
the
other
suspicious
of
this
sudden
exhibition
of
friendship
and
well
he
might
for
while
one
fixed
his
attention
by
some
question
that
provoked
an
answer
usually
about
politics
the
other
gave
a
quick
rap
on
the
back
of
the
horse
and
the
next
thing
the
father
was
grasping
the
pommel
to
keep
from
being
flung
forward
of
the
animal
as
he
threw
up
his
heels
and
plunged
his
head
down
making
the
angle
of
an
incline
plane
even
when
after
a
concerted
plan
one
rode
up
and
pulled
the
cape
of
the
elder
man
overcoat
over
his
head
and
held
it
there
a
moment
while
the
other
gave
the
horse
a
cut
he
sat
like
a
centaur
and
no
surprise
unseated
him
or
loosened
his
grip
on
the
reins
they
knew
his
horsemanship
well
as
he
had
ridden
after
the
hounds
in
maryland
and
virginia
in
his
younger
days
and
had
taught
them
to
sit
a
horse
bareback
when
their
little
fat
legs
were
too
short
to
describe
a
curve
on
the
animal
side
of
course
i
was
always
begging
to
have
them
spare
father
but
it
was
needless
championship
he
enjoyed
their
pranks
with
all
his
soul
it
was
very
hard
to
get
postage
and
he
was
unwary
enough
one
day
on
account
of
the
color
being
the
same
as
the
issue
of
that
year
to
buy
a
dollar
worth
of
his
eldest
scion
only
to
find
them
old
ones
such
as
were
used
before
the
war
whether
he
considered
the
joke
worth
a
dollar
i
could
not
decipher
for
he
was
silent
but
soon
afterward
he
showed
me
an
envelope
marked
in
the
writing
of
his
son
armstrong
containing
the
unlawfully
obtained
we
were
invited
one
night
to
go
to
a
conducted
in
the
real
old
southern
style
the
officers
wanted
us
to
see
some
hunting
but
were
obliged
to
leave
us
behind
hitherto
when
they
crossed
the
brazos
river
on
and
were
the
guests
of
the
planters
in
the
chase
that
began
before
dawn
and
lasted
all
day
we
had
thickets
underbrush
and
ditches
to
encounter
before
the
dogs
treed
the
coon
then
a
little
darkey
brought
along
for
the
climbing
went
up
into
the
branches
and
dislodged
the
game
which
fell
among
our
and
the
neighbors
dogs
no
voice
excited
them
more
wildly
than
the
of
our
old
father
and
when
we
came
home
at
carrying
a
coon
and
a
possum
he
was
as
fresh
as
the
youngest
of
us
the
citizens
surrounding
us
were
so
relieved
to
find
that
our
troops
left
them
unmolested
they
frankly
contrasted
the
disciplined
conduct
with
the
lawlessness
to
which
they
had
been
witness
in
states
where
the
confederate
army
was
stationed
but
they
scarcely
realized
that
an
army
in
time
of
peace
is
much
more
restricted
they
could
hardly
say
enough
about
the
order
that
was
carried
out
preventing
the
negroes
from
joining
the
column
as
it
marched
into
texas
there
was
no
way
of
taking
care
of
them
and
the
general
directed
that
none
should
follow
so
they
went
back
contented
to
work
where
they
would
be
fed
and
clothed
one
reason
that
our
life
seemed
to
me
the
very
perfection
of
all
that
is
ever
attained
on
earth
was
that
the
rumors
of
trouble
with
mexico
had
ceased
the
demands
of
our
government
had
been
complied
with
but
it
was
thought
best
to
keep
the
troops
in
the
field
the
rest
of
the
year
though
there
was
to
be
no
war
our
first
experience
with
a
texas
norther
surprised
and
startled
us
it
came
on
in
the
night
preceded
by
the
usual
heavy
suffocating
air
which
renders
breathing
an
effort
after
this
prelude
the
wild
blast
of
wind
swept
down
on
us
with
a
fury
indescribable
we
heard
the
roar
as
it
approached
over
the
stretch
of
prairie
between
us
and
the
sea
our
tent
though
it
was
guyed
by
ropes
stretched
from
the
to
a
strong
post
driven
far
into
the
ground
both
in
front
and
at
the
rear
shook
rattled
and
flapped
as
if
with
the
rage
of
some
human
creature
it
was
twisted
and
wrenched
from
side
to
side
the
arbor
overhead
seemed
to
toss
to
and
fro
and
the
wagon
rocked
in
a
crazy
effort
to
spill
us
out
though
the
ropes
stretched
and
cracked
like
cordage
at
sea
and
the
canvas
flapped
like
loosened
sails
we
did
not
go
down
indeed
rocked
in
this
improvised
cradle
of
the
deep
it
was
hard
to
tell
whether
one
was
at
sea
or
on
land
i
begged
to
get
up
and
dress
for
the
final
collapse
that
i
was
sure
was
coming
but
my
husband
quieted
me
and
calmed
my
fears
believing
that
the
approaching
rain
would
still
the
wind
as
it
eventually
did
next
morning
a
scene
of
havoc
was
visible
our
neighbors
crept
out
of
their
tents
and
we
women
in
a
little
whispered
aside
exchanged
our
opinions
upon
the
climate
of
the
sunny
south
they
also
had
passed
a
night
of
terror
but
fortunately
their
tents
did
not
go
down
lyon
had
just
come
from
the
north
and
expected
to
join
her
husband
meanwhile
she
was
our
guest
and
the
general
and
i
had
endeavored
to
give
her
as
cordial
a
welcome
as
we
could
feeling
that
all
must
be
so
strange
to
her
after
the
security
and
seclusion
of
her
girlhood
home
the
night
preceding
the
norther
we
took
her
to
her
tent
near
ours
and
helped
her
arrange
for
the
night
assuring
her
that
we
were
so
near
that
we
could
hear
her
voice
if
she
was
in
the
least
afraid
we
being
novices
in
the
experience
of
that
climate
and
its
gales
had
no
idea
the
wind
would
rise
to
such
concert
pitch
that
no
voice
could
be
distinguished
she
said
that
when
we
fastened
her
in
from
the
outside
world
with
two
straps
she
felt
very
uncertain
about
her
courage
holding
out
we
kept
on
assuring
her
not
to
be
afraid
but
on
bidding
her
and
saying
again
not
to
be
in
the
least
disturbed
that
the
sentinel
walked
his
beat
in
front
of
her
tent
all
night
she
dared
not
own
up
that
this
assurance
did
not
tend
to
soothe
her
anxious
fears
for
she
thought
she
would
be
more
afraid
of
the
guard
than
of
anything
else
and
as
i
think
of
it
such
a
from
us
was
rather
unsatisfactory
my
husband
put
the
utmost
faith
in
the
guard
and
i
though
only
so
short
a
time
before
mortally
afraid
of
the
stern
unswerving
warrior
myself
had
soon
forgotten
that
there
were
many
timid
women
in
the
world
who
knew
nothing
of
sleeping
without
locks
or
bolts
and
thought
perhaps
that
at
the
slightest
ignorance
or
dereliction
of
duty
the
sentinel
would
fire
on
an
offender
whether
man
or
woman
added
to
this
fear
of
the
sentinel
the
storm
took
what
remnant
of
nerve
she
had
left
and
though
she
laughed
next
morning
about
her
initiation
into
the
service
of
the
government
there
were
subsequent
confessions
to
the
horror
of
that
unending
night
in
talking
with
major
and
lyon
nowadays
when
it
is
my
privilege
to
see
them
there
seemed
to
be
no
memories
but
pleasant
ones
of
our
texas
life
they
might
well
cherish
two
reminiscences
as
somewhat
disturbing
for
lyon
reception
by
the
hurricane
and
the
major
baptism
of
gore
when
he
killed
his
first
deer
were
not
scenes
that
would
bear
frequent
repetition
and
only
leave
pleasant
memories
the
had
caused
a
long
shade
to
be
built
instead
of
shorter
ones
which
would
have
stood
the
storms
better
under
this
all
of
their
tents
were
pitched
in
two
rows
facing
each
other
and
protected
by
this
arbor
they
daily
took
the
siesta
which
is
almost
compulsory
there
in
the
heat
of
the
noontide
now
the
shade
was
lifted
off
one
side
and
tilted
over
and
some
of
the
tents
were
also
flat
among
them
was
that
of
our
father
custer
he
had
extricated
himself
with
difficulty
from
under
the
canvas
and
described
his
sensations
so
quaintly
that
his
woes
were
greeted
with
roars
of
laughter
from
us
all
after
narrating
the
downfall
of
his
rag
house
he
dryly
remarked
that
it
would
seem
owing
to
the
climate
and
other
causes
he
was
not
going
to
have
much
uninterrupted
sleep
and
looking
slyly
at
the
staff
he
added
that
his
neighborhood
was
not
the
quietest
he
had
ever
known
the
letters
home
at
that
time
in
spite
of
their
description
of
trivial
events
and
the
exuberant
underlined
expressions
of
girlish
pleasure
over
nothings
my
father
enjoyed
and
preserved
i
find
that
our
idle
sundays
were
almost
blanks
in
life
as
we
had
no
service
and
the
hunting
and
riding
were
suspended
i
marked
the
day
by
writing
home
and
a
few
extracts
will
perhaps
present
a
clearer
idea
of
the
life
there
than
anything
that
could
be
written
now
every
sunday
i
wake
up
with
the
thought
of
home
and
wish
that
we
might
be
there
and
go
to
church
with
you
i
can
imagine
how
pleasant
home
is
now
among
other
luxuries
i
see
with
my
eye
a
large
plate
of
your
nice
apples
on
the
table
i
miss
apples
here
none
grow
in
this
country
and
a
man
living
near
here
told
our
henry
that
he
had
seen
one
for
five
years
father
custer
bought
me
some
small
ones
for
fifty
cents
apiece
it
seems
so
strange
that
in
this
state
where
many
planters
live
who
are
rich
enough
to
build
a
church
individually
there
is
such
a
scarcity
of
churches
why
at
the
north
the
first
knowledge
one
has
of
the
proximity
of
a
village
is
by
seeing
a
spire
and
a
church
is
almost
the
first
building
put
up
when
a
town
is
laid
out
here
in
this
country
it
is
the
last
to
be
thought
of
cotton
is
indeed
king
the
cake
you
sent
to
me
by
nettie
greene
dear
mother
was
a
perfect
godsend
oh
anything
you
make
does
taste
so
good
our
orderly
has
perfected
a
trade
for
a
beautiful
little
horse
for
me
so
that
when
custis
lee
corns
trouble
him
i
am
not
obliged
to
take
the
choice
of
staying
at
home
or
riding
one
of
armstrong
prancers
the
new
horse
has
cunning
tricks
getting
down
on
his
knees
to
let
me
get
on
and
off
if
i
tell
him
to
do
so
he
is
very
affectionate
and
he
racks
a
mile
inside
of
three
minutes
we
talk
a
great
deal
here
dear
father
and
my
letters
may
be
like
our
talk
but
any
man
who
has
kept
in
his
stable
for
months
at
a
time
a
famous
worth
as
you
have
kept
don
juan
b
ought
not
to
object
to
a
little
account
of
other
people
animals
we
had
an
offer
of
for
custis
lee
at
alexandria
i
sometimes
have
uninvited
guests
in
my
tent
friday
nettie
saw
something
on
the
tray
that
eliza
was
carrying
it
had
a
long
tail
and
proved
to
be
a
stinging
scorpion
the
citizens
at
our
fear
of
scorpions
and
insist
that
they
are
not
so
very
dangerous
but
i
was
glad
to
have
that
particular
one
killed
by
armstrong
planting
his
gun
on
it
i
feel
much
pleased
and
armstrong
is
quite
proud
that
i
made
myself
a
you
know
i
lost
the
waist
of
mine
in
the
forest
it
took
me
weeks
to
finish
it
being
my
first
attempt
i
ripped
an
old
waist
and
copied
it
by
drawing
lines
with
a
pencil
pinning
and
basting
but
it
fits
very
well
i
remember
how
you
both
wanted
me
to
learn
when
i
was
at
home
and
i
almost
wished
i
had
when
i
found
it
took
me
such
ages
to
do
what
ought
to
have
been
short
work
our
letters
take
twenty
days
in
coming
and
longer
if
there
are
storms
in
the
gulf
the
papers
are
stale
enough
but
armstrong
goes
through
them
all
i
feel
so
rich
and
am
luxuriating
in
four
chairs
that
we
hired
an
old
darkey
to
make
for
us
i
want
to
sit
in
all
four
at
once
it
seems
so
good
to
get
anything
in
which
to
rest
that
has
a
back
our
dogs
give
us
such
pleasure
though
it
took
me
some
time
to
get
used
to
the
din
they
set
up
when
armstrong
practiced
on
the
horn
they
call
it
tongue
here
but
i
call
that
too
mild
a
word
their
whole
bodies
seem
hollow
they
bring
forth
such
wild
cries
and
cavernous
howls
we
call
them
byron
brandy
jupiter
rattler
sultan
and
tyler
something
awful
is
constantly
occurring
among
the
citizens
it
is
a
lawless
country
a
relative
of
one
of
our
old
army
officers
a
prominent
planter
living
near
here
was
shot
dead
in
houston
by
a
man
bearing
an
old
grudge
against
him
it
is
a
common
occurrence
to
shoot
down
men
here
for
any
offense
whatever
armstrong
never
goes
anywhere
except
for
hunting
and
as
we
have
plenty
of
books
and
our
evening
rides
we
enjoy
life
thoroughly
nettie
fell
from
her
horse
and
we
were
frightened
for
a
time
but
she
was
only
lamed
though
she
weighs
pounds
autie
c
picked
her
up
as
if
she
were
a
baby
and
carried
her
into
their
tent
besides
visiting
at
the
house
of
the
collector
of
the
port
where
there
is
a
houseful
of
young
girls
we
have
been
hospitably
treated
by
some
people
to
whom
armstrong
was
able
to
be
of
use
one
day
a
gentle
southern
woman
came
into
our
tent
to
see
armstrong
and
asked
his
protection
for
her
boy
telling
him
that
for
some
childish
carelessness
the
neighboring
colored
people
had
threatened
his
life
armstrong
believed
her
and
melted
he
afterward
inquired
elsewhere
into
the
matter
and
was
convinced
that
the
boy
had
not
intentionally
erred
the
child
himself
was
proof
by
his
frank
manner
and
his
straightforward
story
of
his
innocence
i
suppose
we
were
the
first
yankees
these
people
had
ever
known
and
doubtless
nothing
but
gratitude
induced
them
even
to
speak
with
us
yet
they
conquered
prejudice
and
asked
us
to
dinner
they
had
been
so
well
dressed
when
they
called
and
were
accounted
rich
i
believe
by
the
neighbors
that
i
could
scarcely
believe
we
had
reached
the
right
house
when
we
halted
it
was
like
the
cabins
of
the
white
trash
in
the
forest
only
larger
i
thought
we
had
mistaken
the
negro
quarters
for
the
master
two
large
rooms
with
extensions
at
the
rear
were
divided
by
an
open
space
roofed
over
under
which
the
table
was
spread
the
house
was
of
rough
logs
and
unpainted
unless
the
texans
built
with
home
materials
their
houses
cost
as
much
as
palaces
abroad
for
the
dressed
lumber
had
to
be
hauled
from
the
seacoast
the
inside
of
this
queer
home
was
in
marked
contrast
with
the
exterior
the
furniture
was
modern
and
handsome
and
the
piano
on
which
the
accomplished
mother
as
well
as
her
little
son
gave
us
music
was
from
one
of
our
best
northern
manufactories
the
china
glass
and
linen
on
the
were
still
another
surprise
they
never
broached
politics
gave
us
an
excellent
dinner
and
got
on
armstrong
blind
side
forever
by
giving
him
a
valuable
pointer
called
ginnie
short
for
virginia
with
four
game
chickens
a
virginia
cured
ham
as
that
was
their
former
state
and
two
turkeys
we
were
sent
on
our
way
rejoicing
our
henry
has
gone
home
and
we
miss
him
for
he
is
fidelity
itself
he
expects
to
move
his
entire
family
of
negroes
from
virginia
to
monroe
because
he
says
father
you
are
the
finest
man
he
ever
see
prepare
then
for
the
dark
cloud
that
is
moving
toward
you
and
you
may
have
the
privilege
of
contributing
to
their
support
for
a
time
if
he
follows
eliza
plan
of
billeting
the
orphan
upon
us
we
have
a
new
cook
called
uncle
charley
who
has
heretofore
been
a
preacher
but
now
condescends
to
get
up
good
dinners
for
us
we
had
eleven
to
dine
and
borrowed
dishes
of
our
southern
neighbors
we
had
a
soup
made
out
of
an
immense
turtle
that
armstrong
killed
in
the
stream
yesterday
then
followed
turkeys
boiled
ham
and
roast
beef
of
course
for
armstrong
thinks
no
dinner
quite
perfect
without
his
beef
we
are
living
well
and
on
so
little
armstrong
pay
as
a
will
soon
cease
and
we
are
trying
now
to
get
accustomed
to
living
on
less
i
listen
to
the
citizens
talking
over
the
prospects
of
this
state
and
i
think
it
promises
wonders
there
are
chances
for
all
the
time
thrown
in
armstrong
way
but
he
seems
to
think
that
while
he
is
on
duty
he
had
better
not
enter
into
business
schemes
armstrong
has
such
good
success
in
hunting
and
fishing
that
he
sends
to
the
other
officers
messes
turtle
deer
duck
quail
squirrels
doves
and
prairie
chickens
the
possums
are
accepted
with
many
a
scrape
and
flourish
by
the
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
our
nine
dogs
sleep
round
our
wagon
at
night
quarreling
growling
snoring
but
i
sleep
too
soundly
to
be
kept
awake
by
them
the
very
ants
in
texas
though
not
poisonous
were
provided
with
such
sharp
nippers
that
they
made
me
jump
from
my
chair
with
a
bound
if
after
going
out
of
sight
in
the
neck
or
sleeves
of
my
dress
they
attempted
to
cut
their
way
out
they
clipped
one
flesh
with
sharp
little
cuts
that
were
not
pleasant
especially
when
there
remained
a
doubt
as
to
whether
it
might
be
a
scorpion
we
had
to
guard
our
linen
carefully
for
they
cut
it
up
with
ugly
little
slits
that
were
hard
to
mend
besides
we
had
to
be
careful
as
we
were
so
cut
off
that
we
could
not
well
replace
our
few
clothes
and
it
costs
a
ruinous
sum
to
send
north
or
even
to
new
orleans
for
anything
i
found
this
out
when
the
general
paid
an
express
bill
on
a
gown
from
new
york
ordered
before
we
left
the
east
far
larger
than
the
cost
of
the
material
and
the
dressmaker
bill
together
the
ants
besieged
the
and
set
uncle
charley
and
eliza
to
growling
but
an
old
settler
told
them
to
surround
the
place
with
and
they
were
thus
freed
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
the
general
from
digging
down
into
the
as
he
was
anxious
to
see
into
their
mechanism
the
colored
people
and
citizens
told
us
what
fighters
they
were
and
what
injuries
they
inflicted
on
people
who
molested
them
we
watched
them
curiously
day
by
day
and
wanted
to
see
if
the
residents
had
told
us
stories
about
their
stripping
the
trees
of
foliage
just
to
guy
us
it
has
long
been
the
favorite
pastime
of
old
residents
to
impose
all
sorts
of
improbable
tales
on
the
whether
this
occurrence
happens
often
or
not
i
can
not
say
but
it
certainly
took
place
once
while
we
were
there
one
morning
my
husband
ran
into
the
tent
and
asked
me
to
hurry
up
with
my
dressing
he
had
something
strange
to
show
me
and
helped
me
scramble
into
my
clothes
the
in
front
of
our
tents
cut
rather
deep
ruts
over
which
the
ants
found
a
difficult
passage
so
they
had
laid
a
causeway
of
bits
of
cut
leaves
over
which
they
journeyed
between
a
tree
and
their
not
far
from
our
tents
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
they
were
still
traveling
back
and
forth
each
bearing
a
bit
of
leaf
bigger
than
itself
and
a
tree
near
us
which
had
been
full
of
foliage
the
day
before
was
entirely
bare
for
some
reason
unexplainable
malarial
fever
broke
out
among
our
staff
it
was
i
suppose
the
acclimation
to
which
we
were
being
subjected
my
father
custer
was
ill
and
came
forth
from
the
siege
whitened
out
while
the
officers
disappeared
to
mourn
over
the
number
of
their
bones
for
a
few
days
and
then
crept
out
of
the
tents
as
soon
as
they
could
move
my
husband
all
this
time
had
never
even
changed
color
his
powers
of
endurance
amazed
me
he
seemed
to
have
set
his
strong
will
against
yielding
to
climatic
influences
but
after
two
days
of
this
fighting
he
gave
in
and
tossed
himself
on
our
borrowed
lounge
a
vanquished
man
he
was
very
sick
fever
had
waited
to
do
its
worst
with
its
last
victim
everything
looked
very
gloomy
to
me
we
had
not
even
a
wide
bed
on
which
it
is
a
little
comfort
if
a
patient
can
fling
himself
from
side
to
side
we
had
no
ice
no
fruit
indeed
nothing
but
quinine
the
supplies
of
that
drug
to
the
hospital
department
of
texas
must
be
sent
by
the
barrel
it
seemed
to
me
from
the
manner
in
which
it
was
consumed
our
devoted
surgeon
came
of
his
own
accord
over
and
over
again
and
was
untiring
in
his
patience
in
coming
when
i
sent
for
him
to
please
me
in
my
anxiety
my
husband
was
so
racked
and
tormented
by
pain
and
burnt
up
with
fiery
heat
that
he
hardly
made
the
feeblest
fight
about
the
medicine
after
having
attained
the
satisfaction
of
my
tasting
it
to
be
sure
that
i
knew
how
bitter
it
was
as
the
fever
abated
every
hour
i
resorted
to
new
modes
of
bribery
and
corruption
to
get
him
to
swallow
the
huge
pill
my
stepmother
cake
had
come
in
the
very
best
time
for
i
extracted
the
raisins
and
hid
the
quinine
in
them
as
my
father
had
done
when
giving
me
medicine
as
a
child
it
seemed
to
me
an
interminable
time
before
the
disease
began
to
yield
to
the
remedies
in
reality
it
was
not
long
as
the
general
was
unaccustomed
to
medicine
and
its
effect
was
more
quickly
realized
on
that
account
even
when
my
husband
began
to
crawl
about
again
the
doctor
continued
the
medicine
and
i
as
nurse
remorselessly
carried
out
his
directions
though
i
had
by
no
means
a
tractable
patient
as
with
returning
health
came
restored
combative
powers
my
husband
noticed
the
rapid
disappearance
of
the
pills
from
the
table
when
he
lay
and
watched
the
hated
things
with
relief
as
he
discovered
that
he
was
being
aided
in
the
consumption
by
some
unknown
friend
one
morning
we
found
the
plate
on
which
the
doctor
had
placed
thirty
the
night
before
empty
of
course
i
accused
the
general
of
being
the
cause
of
the
strange
disappearance
and
prepared
to
send
for
more
inexorable
in
my
temporary
reign
over
a
weak
man
he
attempted
a
mild
kicking
celebration
and
clapping
accompaniment
over
the
departure
of
his
hated
medicine
as
much
as
his
rather
unsteady
feet
and
arms
would
allow
but
stoutly
denied
having
done
away
with
the
offending
pills
the
next
night
we
kept
watch
over
the
fresh
supply
and
soon
after
dark
the
ants
began
their
migrations
up
the
loose
on
the
that
fell
against
the
canvas
and
while
one
grasped
the
pill
with
his
long
nippers
the
partner
pushed
steered
and
helped
roll
the
plunder
down
the
side
of
the
tent
on
to
the
ground
the
triumph
of
the
citizens
was
complete
their
tales
were
outdone
by
our
actual
experience
after
that
there
was
no
story
they
told
us
which
we
did
not
take
in
immediately
without
question
the
hunting
included
alligators
also
in
the
stream
below
us
there
were
occasional
deep
pools
darkened
by
the
overhanging
trees
as
we
women
walked
on
the
banks
we
kept
a
respectful
distance
from
the
places
where
the
bend
in
the
creek
widened
into
a
pond
with
still
water
near
the
high
banks
in
one
of
these
dark
pools
lived
an
ancient
alligator
well
known
to
the
neighbors
on
which
they
had
been
unsuccessfully
firing
for
years
the
darkeys
kept
aloof
from
his
fastness
and
even
eliza
whose
soul
longed
for
the
running
water
of
the
stream
for
she
had
struggled
with
muddy
water
so
long
trembled
at
the
tales
of
this
monster
she
reminds
me
now
what
a
lovely
place
to
wash
that
gros
was
down
by
the
creek
but
it
was
near
the
old
pool
and
i
know
i
hurried
up
my
wash
awfully
for
i
was
afraid
he
might
come
up
for
you
know
miss
libbie
it
was
reckoned
that
they
was
mighty
fond
of
children
and
colored
people
illustration
measuring
an
alligator
one
of
the
young
officers
was
determined
to
get
this
veteran
and
day
after
day
went
up
and
down
the
creek
coming
home
at
night
to
meet
the
jeers
of
the
others
who
did
not
believe
that
in
a
hot
country
paid
one
night
he
stopped
at
our
tent
radiant
and
jubilant
he
had
shot
the
old
disturber
of
the
peace
the
intimidator
of
the
neighborhood
and
was
going
for
help
to
haul
him
up
to
the
tents
he
was
a
monster
and
it
cost
the
men
tough
pulling
to
get
him
up
the
bank
and
then
to
drag
him
down
near
our
tent
there
he
was
left
for
us
women
to
see
we
walked
around
and
around
him
very
brave
and
quite
relieved
to
think
that
we
were
rid
of
so
dangerous
a
neighbor
with
a
real
old
mouth
the
general
congratulated
the
young
officer
heartily
and
wished
it
had
been
his
successful
shot
that
had
ended
him
part
of
the
jaw
had
been
shot
away
evidently
years
ago
as
it
was
then
calloused
over
it
was
distended
to
its
utmost
capacity
and
propped
open
with
a
stick
nettie
brought
out
a
broom
from
her
tent
with
which
to
get
a
rough
estimate
of
his
length
as
we
knew
well
that
if
we
did
not
give
some
idea
of
his
size
in
our
letters
home
they
would
think
the
climate
which
enervates
so
quickly
had
produced
a
total
collapse
in
our
power
to
tell
the
truth
the
broom
did
not
begin
to
answer
so
we
pieced
out
the
measure
with
something
else
in
order
to
arrive
at
some
kind
of
accuracy
then
we
thought
we
would
like
to
see
how
the
beast
looked
with
his
mouth
closed
and
the
officers
patient
in
humoring
our
whims
pulled
out
the
props
there
was
a
sudden
commotion
the
next
thing
visible
was
three
sets
of
flying
petticoats
making
for
the
tent
as
the
alligator
revived
by
the
sudden
of
his
upper
jaw
sprawled
out
his
feet
and
began
to
walk
over
the
grass
the
crack
of
the
rifle
a
moment
after
brought
the
heads
of
three
cowards
from
their
tents
but
after
that
no
woman
hovered
over
even
his
dead
hide
the
general
was
convulsed
over
our
retreat
the
drying
skin
of
his
majesty
the
lord
of
the
pool
flung
and
flapped
in
the
wind
suspended
to
the
pole
of
the
officers
arbor
for
weeks
and
it
was
well
tanned
by
the
air
long
before
they
ceased
to
make
sly
allusions
to
women
curiosity
at
last
in
november
the
sealed
proposals
from
citizens
to
the
quartermaster
for
the
contract
for
transporting
the
camp
equipage
and
baggage
forage
over
the
country
were
all
in
and
the
most
reasonable
of
the
propositions
was
accepted
orders
had
come
to
move
on
to
austin
the
capital
where
we
were
to
winter
it
was
with
real
regret
that
i
saw
our
traps
packed
the
tents
of
our
pretty
encampment
taken
down
the
arbors
thrown
over
and
our
faces
turned
toward
the
interior
of
the
state
the
general
too
buoyant
not
to
think
that
every
move
would
better
us
felt
nothing
but
pleasure
to
be
on
the
march
again
the
journey
was
very
pleasant
through
the
day
and
we
were
not
compelled
to
rise
before
dawn
for
the
sun
was
by
no
means
unbearable
as
it
had
been
in
august
it
was
cold
at
night
and
the
wind
blew
around
the
wagon
flapping
the
curtains
under
which
it
penetrated
and
lifting
the
covers
unless
they
were
strongly
secured
as
to
trying
to
keep
warm
by
a
in
november
i
rather
incline
to
the
belief
that
it
is
impossible
instead
of
heat
coming
into
the
tent
where
i
put
on
my
habit
with
benumbed
fingers
the
wind
blew
the
smoke
in
sometimes
the
mornings
were
so
cold
i
begged
to
be
left
in
bed
and
argued
that
the
mules
could
be
attached
and
i
could
go
straight
on
to
camp
warm
all
the
way
but
my
husband
woke
my
drowsy
pride
by
saying
the
officers
will
surely
think
you
a
soldier
which
term
of
derision
was
applied
to
a
man
who
sought
soft
places
for
duty
and
avoided
hardships
driving
when
he
ought
to
ride
if
we
all
huddled
around
one
of
my
husband
splendid
i
came
in
for
the
smoke
the
officers
pretty
little
gallantries
about
smoke
always
following
beauty
did
not
keep
my
eyes
from
being
blistered
and
blinded
it
was
after
all
not
a
very
great
hardship
as
during
the
day
we
had
the
royal
sun
of
that
southern
winter
my
husband
rode
on
in
advance
every
day
to
select
a
camp
he
gave
the
choice
into
my
hands
sometimes
but
it
was
hard
to
keep
wood
water
and
suitable
ground
uppermost
i
wanted
always
the
sheltered
pretty
spots
we
enjoyed
every
mile
of
our
march
it
rained
sometimes
pouring
down
so
suddenly
that
a
retreat
to
the
traveling
wagons
was
impossible
one
day
i
was
wet
to
the
skin
three
times
and
my
husband
wondered
what
the
anxious
father
and
mother
who
used
frantically
to
call
rubbers
after
me
as
a
girl
when
i
tried
to
slip
out
unnoticed
would
say
to
him
then
but
it
did
not
hurt
me
in
the
least
the
general
actually
seemed
unconscious
of
the
shower
he
wore
a
soldier
overcoat
pulled
his
broad
hat
down
to
shed
the
rain
and
encouraged
me
by
saying
i
was
getting
to
be
a
tough
veteran
which
among
us
was
very
high
praise
indeed
we
were
all
then
so
well
we
snapped
our
fingers
at
the
fever
if
we
broke
the
ice
in
the
bucket
for
our
early
ablutions
it
became
a
matter
to
joke
over
when
the
sun
was
up
and
we
all
rode
together
laughing
and
singing
at
the
head
of
the
column
our
march
was
usually
miles
sometimes
thirty
in
a
day
the
general
and
i
foraged
at
the
farms
we
passed
and
bought
good
butter
eggs
and
poultry
he
began
to
collect
turkeys
for
the
winter
until
we
had
enough
for
a
year
uncle
charley
was
doing
his
best
to
awe
eliza
with
his
numerous
new
dishes
though
he
was
a
preacher
he
put
on
that
profession
on
sundays
as
he
did
his
best
coat
and
if
during
the
week
the
fire
smoked
or
a
dog
stole
some
prepared
dish
that
was
standing
one
side
to
cool
he
expressed
himself
in
tones
not
loud
but
deep
and
had
as
extensive
a
collection
of
negro
oaths
as
texas
afforded
which
i
believe
is
saying
a
good
deal
my
husband
observant
as
he
always
was
wondered
what
possessed
the
old
fellow
when
preparing
poultry
for
dinner
we
used
slyly
to
watch
him
go
one
side
seize
the
chicken
and
while
swiftly
wringing
its
neck
mumble
some
unintelligible
words
to
himself
then
throw
down
the
fowl
in
a
way
and
sit
down
to
pluck
it
we
were
mystified
and
had
to
get
eliza
to
explain
this
peculiar
proceeding
that
went
on
day
after
day
she
said
that
though
uncle
charley
does
swear
so
powerful
he
has
a
kind
of
superstition
that
poultry
has
a
hereafter
evidently
he
thought
it
was
not
right
to
send
them
to
their
last
home
without
what
he
intended
for
a
funeral
oration
sometimes
he
said
as
fast
as
his
nimble
old
tongue
could
clatter
hark
from
the
tombs
a
doleful
sound
mine
ears
attend
the
cry
ye
living
hens
come
view
the
ground
where
you
must
shortly
die
once
after
this
my
husband
by
hiding
contrived
to
be
present
though
unseen
at
one
of
these
funeral
ceremonies
princes
this
clay
must
be
your
bed
in
spite
of
all
your
towers
the
tall
the
wise
the
reverend
head
must
lie
as
low
as
yours
he
so
timed
his
verses
that
with
one
wrench
he
gave
the
final
turn
to
the
poor
chicken
head
as
he
jerked
out
the
last
line
my
husband
perfectly
convulsed
himself
was
in
terror
for
fear
uncle
charley
would
have
his
feelings
hurt
by
seeing
us
and
hearing
my
giggling
and
i
nearly
smothered
myself
in
the
attempt
to
get
back
to
our
tent
where
the
general
threw
himself
down
with
shrieks
of
laughter
we
varied
our
march
by
many
an
exciting
race
after
the
chapparral
bushes
defeated
us
frequently
by
making
such
good
for
the
hare
d
if
we
came
to
a
long
stretch
of
open
prairie
and
a
rabbit
lifted
his
head
above
the
grass
the
general
uttered
a
wild
whoop
to
his
dog
a
come
on
to
me
and
off
we
dashed
some
of
the
staff
occasionally
joined
while
our
father
custer
bent
over
his
old
roan
horse
mildly
struck
him
with
a
spur
and
was
in
at
the
death
the
ground
was
excellent
for
a
run
level
and
grassy
we
had
a
superb
greyhound
called
byron
that
was
devoted
to
the
general
and
after
a
successful
chase
it
was
rewarded
with
many
a
demonstration
of
affection
he
was
the
most
lordly
dog
i
think
i
ever
saw
powerful
with
deep
chest
and
carrying
his
head
in
a
royal
way
when
he
started
for
a
run
with
his
nostrils
distended
and
his
delicate
ears
laid
back
on
his
noble
head
each
bound
sent
him
flying
through
the
air
he
hardly
touched
the
elastic
cushions
of
his
feet
to
earth
before
he
again
was
spread
out
like
a
dark
straight
thread
this
gathering
and
leaping
must
be
seen
to
realize
how
marvelous
is
the
rapidity
and
how
the
motion
seems
flying
almost
as
the
ground
is
scorned
except
at
a
sort
of
spring
bound
he
trotted
back
to
the
general
if
he
happened
to
be
in
advance
with
the
rabbit
in
his
mouth
and
holding
back
his
proud
head
delivered
the
game
only
to
his
chief
the
tribute
that
a
woman
pays
to
beauty
in
any
form
i
gave
to
byron
but
i
never
cared
much
for
him
a
greyhound
heart
could
be
put
into
a
thimble
byron
cared
for
the
general
as
much
as
his
cold
soul
could
for
any
one
but
it
was
not
to
be
compared
with
the
dear
ginnie
she
was
all
love
she
was
almost
human
the
dog
was
in
an
injured
state
with
me
much
of
the
time
in
quarters
he
resented
all
my
rights
my
husband
had
a
great
fashion
of
flinging
himself
on
the
bed
or
even
on
the
floor
if
it
was
carpeted
he
told
me
he
believed
he
must
unconsciously
have
acquired
the
habit
at
west
point
where
the
zeal
of
the
cadet
seems
divided
between
his
studies
and
an
effort
to
keep
the
wrinkles
out
of
the
regulation
white
pantaloons
which
being
of
duck
are

creased
what
punishment
government
sees
fit
to
inflict
for
each
separate
crease
i
do
know
but
certainly
its
embryo
soldiers
have
implanted
in
them
a
fear
of
consequences
even
regarding
rumpled
linen
as
soon
as
the
general
tossed
himself
on
the
bed
byron
walked
to
him
and
was
invited
to
share
the
luxury
certainly
my
husband
used
to
say
sarcastically
walk
right
up
here
on
this
clean
white
spread
without
troubling
yourself
to
care
whether
your
feet
are
covered
with
mud
or
not
your
aunt
eliza
wants
you
to
lie
on
nice
white
counterpanes
she
washes
them
on
purpose
for
you
byron
answered
this
invitation
by
licking
his
host
hand
and
turning
in
the
most
scornful
manner
on
me
as
i
uttered
a
mild
protest
regarding
his
muddy
paws
the
general
quickly
remarked
that
i
made
invidious
distinctions
as
no
spread
seemed
too
fine
or
white
for
ginnie
in
my
mind
while
if
eliza
happened
to
enter
a
pair
of
blazing
eyes
and
an
energetically
expressed
opinion
of
byron
ensued
and
he
retorted
by
lifting
his
upper
lip
over
some
of
the
whitest
fangs
i
ever
saw
the
general
still
aiding
and
abetting
asked
the
dog
to
let
aunt
eliza
see
what
an
intelligent
knowing
animal
he
was
how
soon
he
distinguished
his
friends
from
his
foes
such
an
exasperating
brute
and
such
a
tormenting
master
were
best
left
alone
but
i
was
tired
and
wanted
to
lie
down
so
i
told
eliza
that
if
she
would
stand
there
i
would
try
the
broom
a
woman
weapon
on
his
royal
highness
byron
would
move
and
growled
even
at
me
then
i
quite
meekly
took
what
little
place
was
left
the
general
sense
of
mischief
and
his
peculiar
fondness
for
not
interfering
in
a
fight
now
coming
in
to
keep
him
silent
the
dog
rolled
over
and
shammed
sleep
but
soon
planting
his
feet
against
my
back
which
was
turned
in
high
dudgeon
he
pushed
and
pushed
seemingly
without
premeditation
his
dreadful
eyes
shut
until
i
was
nearly
shoved
off
i
was
conquered
and
rose
afraid
of
the
dog
and
momentarily
irritated
at
my
defeat
and
his
tyranny
while
eliza
read
a
lesson
to
the
general
she
said
see
what
you
done
you
keer
more
for
that
old
hound
than
you
does
for
miss
libbie
ginnel
i
be
if
i
was
you
what
would
your
mother
custer
think
of
you
now
but
my
feelings
were
not
seriously
hurt
and
the
general
having
watched
to
the
last
to
see
how
far
the
brute
would
carry
his
jealousy
gave
him
a
kick
that
sent
him
sprawling
on
the
floor
springing
up
to
restore
me
to
my
place
and
close
the
colored
harangue
that
was
going
on
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
eliza
rarely
dignified
me
with
the
honor
of
being
referee
in
any
disputed
question
she

to
say
no

whether
it
right
or

the
ginnel
her
droll
way
of
treating
him
like
a
big
boy
away
from
home
for
the
first
time
always
amused
him
she
threatened
to
tell
his
mother
and
brought
up
that
sainted
woman
in
all
our
encounters
as
she
did
in
the
dog
episode
just
mentioned
as
if
the
very
name
would
restore
order
at
once
and
give
eliza
her
own
way
in
regulating
us
but
dear
mother
custer
had
been
in
the

of
too
many
happy
scuffles
and
the
centre
of
too
many
friendly
fisticuffs
among
her
active
irrepressible

restore

chapter
vii
life
in
a
texas
town
one
day
we
heard
shout
upon
shout
from
many
a
soldier
throat
in
camp
the
headquarters
guard
and
officers
servants
even
the
officers
themselves
joined
in
the
hallooing
and
we
ran
out
to
see
what
could
be
the
matter
it
was
our
lordly
byron
stately
and
superb
as
he
usually
was
he
had
another
side
to
his
character
and
now
he
was
racing
up
from
camp
a
huge
piece
of
meat
in
his
jaws
which
he
had
stolen
from
the
where
it
was
boiling
for
the
soldiers
dinner
his
retreat
was
accompanied
with
every
sort
of
missile
sticks
boots
and
rocks
but
this
dog
that
made
himself
into
a
greased
streak
of
lightning
as
a
colored
woman
described
him
bounded
on
untouched
by
the
flying
hail
of
the
soldiers
wrath
the
general
did
not
dare
to
shout
and
dance
in
sight
of
the
men
over
what
he
thought
so
cunning
in
this
hateful
dog
as
he
was
not
protected
by
the
friendly
walls
of
our
tent
but
he
chuckled
and
his
eyes
danced
for
the
brute
dropped
the
hot
meat
when
he
had
looked
about
to
discover
how
close
his
pursuers
were
and
then
seeing
the
enemy
nearing
him
picked
it
up
and
distanced
them
all
the
general
went
back
to
his
tent
and
called
eliza
to
torment
her
with
an
account
of
what
her
favorite
had
done
all
by
himself
she
spared
no
words
to
express
her
opinion
of
the
hated
hound
for
byron
was
no
respecter
of
persons
when
the
sly
side
of
his
character
was
uppermost
he
stole
his
master
dinner
just
as
readily
as
the
neighbors
eliza
said
no
one
could
tell
how
many
times
he
had
made
off
with
a
part
of
her
dinner
just
dished
up
to
be
served
and
then
gone
off
on
a
prowl
after
he
gorged
hissel
as
she
expressed
it
hidin
from
the
other
dogs
and
burying
it
in
jest
such
a
stingy
way
you
might
from
such
a
worthless
plunderin
old
villain
the
march
to
austin
was
varied
by
fording
all
the
streams
and
rivers
were
crossed
in
that
manner
except
one
where
we
used
the
pontoon
bridge
the
colorado
we
found
too
high
to
ford
and
so
made
a
détour
of
some
miles
the
citizens
were
not
unfriendly
while
there
was
a
total
cessation
of
work
on
the
part
of
the
negroes
until
our
column
went
by
they
sat
on
the
fences
like
a
row
of
black
crows
and
with
their
usual
politeness
made
an
attempt
to
answer
questions
the
troops
put
to
them
which
were
unanswerable
even
in
the
ingenious
brain
of
the
propounder
well
uncle
how
far
is
it
ten
miles
down
the
road
from
here
if
their
feelings
were
hurt
by
such
irrepressible
fun
they
were
soon
healed
by
the
lively
trade
they
kept
up
in
chickens
eggs
and
butter
the
citizens
sometimes
answered
the
general
salute
and
his
interested
questions
about
the
horse
they
rode
by
joining
us
for
a
short
distance
on
the
march
the
horseflesh
of
texas
was
a
delight
to
him
but
i
could
not
be
so
interested
in
the
fine
points
as
to
forget
the
disfiguring
brands
that
were
often
upon
the
foreshoulder
as
well
as
the
flank
they
spoke
volumes
for
the
country
where
a
man
has
to
sear
a
thoroughbred
with
a
hot
iron
to
ensure
his
keeping
possession
father
custer
used
to
say
what
sort
of
country
is
this
anyhow
when
a
man
in
order
to
keep
his
property
has
got
to
print
the
whole
constitution
of
the
united
states
on
his
horse
the
whole
of
the
texans
was
rather
cumbersome
it
seemed
to
me
though
they
rode
perfectly
they
frequently
had
a
mexican
saddle
heavily
ornamented
with
silver
on
the
high
pommel
and
everywhere
else
that
it
could
be
added
even
the
design
of
the
stamped
leather
for
which
mexico
is
famous
was
embroidered
with
silver
bullion
the
stirrup
had
handsome
leather
covers
while
a
fringe
of
thongs
fell
almost
to
the
ground
to
aid
in
pushing
their
way
through
the
tall
prairie
grass
sometimes
the
extending
to
the
crupper
was
of
fur
the
bridle
and
bit
were
rich
with
silver
also
on
the
massive
silver
pommel
hung
an
incongruous
coil
of
rope
disfiguring
and
ugly
there
was
an
iron
attached
to
the
lariat
which
we
soon
learned
was
of
inestimable
value
in
the
long
rides
that
the
texans
took
if
a
man
made
a
halt
he
encircled
himself
with
this
prickly
lariat
and
lay
down
securely
knowing
that
no
snake
could
cross
that
barrier
in
a
land
of
venomous
serpents
it
behooved
a
man
to
carry
his
own
abatis
everywhere
the
saddle
was
also
secured
by
a
cinch
or
girth
of
which
hard
riders
found
a
great
help
in
keeping
the
saddle
firm
the
texan
himself
though
not
often
wearing
the
mexican
sombrero
wore
usually
a
felt
hat
on
which
the
general
afterward
doted
as
the
felt
was
of
superior
quality
if
the
term
dude
had
been
invented
then
it
would
often
have
applied
to
a
texan
horseman
the
hair
was
frequently
long
and
they
wore
no
waistcoat
i
concluded
because
they
could
better
display
the
vast
expanse
of
while
the
general
and
his
casual
companion
in
our
march
talked
horse
too
absorbed
to
notice
anything
else
i
used
to
lose
myself
in
the
contemplation
of
the
maze
of
tucks
puffs
and
embroidery
of
this
cambric
finery
ornamented
with
three
the
wearer
seemed
to
me
to
represent
two
epochs
the
fine
linen
and
blooded
horse
belonged
to
the
war
while
the
ragged
elbows
of
the
and
the
worn
boots
were
decidedly
since
the
war
if
the
was
intricate
in
its
workmanship
the
boots
were
ignored
by
the
placid
owner
they
usually
had
the
mexican
serape
strapped
to
the
back
of
the
saddle
or
if
it
was
cold
as
it
was
in
our
late
november
march
they
put
their
head
through
the
opening
in
the
middle
so
woven
for
that
purpose
and
flung
the
end
across
their
breast
and
over
one
shoulder
in
a
picturesque
manner
the
bright
hues
of
the
blanket
dyed
by
the
indians
from
the
juice
of
the
prickly
pear
its
soft
flexible
folds
having
been
woven
in
a
made
a
graceful
and
attractive
bit
of
color
which
was
not
at
all
out
of
place
in
that
country
these
blankets
were
valuable
possessions
they
were
so
pliable
and
perfectly
that
they
protected
one
from
every
storm
we
had
a
pair
which
we
used
through
every
subsequent
campaign
and
when
the
cold
in
kansas
and
dakota
became
almost
unbearable
sometimes
after
the
long
trial
of
a
journey
in
the
wagon
my
husband
used
to
say
we
will
resort
to
extreme
measures
libbie
and
wrap
you
in
the
mexican
blankets
they
were
the
warmest
of
all
our
wraps
nothing
seemed
to
fade
them
and
even
when
burnt
with
tom
cigarette
ashes
or
stuck
through
with
the
general
spurs
they
did
not
ravel
as
do
other
fabrics
they
have
hung
as
portières
in
my
little
home
and
the
design
and
coloring
are
so
like
the
persian
rug
on
the
floor
that
it
seems
to
be
an
argument
to
prove
that
ignatius
donnelly
in
his
theory
of
atlantis
is
right
and
that
we
once
had
a
land
highway
between
the
east
and
mexico
and
that
the
reason
the
aztec
now
uses
the
designs
on
his
pottery
and
in
his
weaving
is
that
his
ancestors
brought
over
the
first
sketches
on
papyrus
e
a
texan
travels
for
comfort
and
safety
rather
than
for
style
if
a
norther
overtakes
him
he
dismounts
and
drives
the
into
the
ground
thus
tethering
his
horse
which
turns
his
back
the
better
to
withstand
the
oncoming
wind
the
master
throws
himself
face
down
in
the
long
grass
buried
in
his
blanket
and
thus
awaits
the
termination
of
the
fury
with
which
the
storm
sweeps
a
texas
prairie
sometimes
one
of
the
planters
after
riding
a
distance
with
us
talking
the
county
over
and
taking
in
every
point
of
our
horses
as
he
rode
made
his
adieus
and
said
he
was
now
at
his
own
place
where
he
turned
in
the
general
followed
his
fine
thoroughbred
with
longing
eyes
and
was
more
than
astonished
to
find
in
what
stables
they
kept
these
valuable
and
delicate
animals
no
matter
if
the
house
was
habitable
the
stable
was
usually
in
a
state
of
careless
dilapidation
doors
swung
on
one
hinge
and
clapboards
were
torn
off
here
and
there
while
the
warped
roof
was
far
from
even
though
texas
is
in
the
sunny
south
the
first
sharp
norther
awakens
one
to
the
knowledge
that
it
is
not
always
summer
sometimes
these
storms
are
quickly
over
but
frequently
they
last
three
days
this
carelessness
about
stabling
stock
was
not
owing
to
the
depredations
of
an
invading
army
we
were
the
first
yankees
they
had
seen
it
was
the
general
shiftlessness
that
creeps
into
one
veins
we
were
not
long
there
ourselves
before
climatic
influence
had
its
effect
on
even
the
most
active
among
us
before
we
reached
austin
several
citizens
sent
out
invitations
for
us
to
come
to
their
houses
but
i
knew
the
general
would
not
accept
and
cold
as
the
nights
were
i
felt
unwilling
to
lose
a
day
of
camp
life
we
pitched
our
tents
on
rolling
ground
in
the
vicinity
of
austin
where
we
overlooked
a
pretty
town
of
stuccoed
houses
that
appeared
summery
in
the
midst
of
the
perennial
green
the
state
house
land
office
and
governor
mansion
looked
regal
to
us
so
long
bivouacking
in
the
forest
and
on
uncultivated
prairies
the
governor
offered
for
our
headquarters
the
blind
asylum
which
had
been
closed
during
the
war
this
possessed
one
advantage
that
we
were
glad
to
improve
there
was
room
enough
for
all
the
staff
and
a
long
saloon
parlor
and
for
our
hops
during
the
winter
by
this
time
two
pretty
agreeable
women
wives
of
were
added
to
our
circle
still
i
went
into
the
building
with
regret
the
wagon
in
which
the
wind
had
rocked
me
to
sleep
so
often
and
which
had
proved
such
a
stronghold
against
the
crawling
foes
of
the
country
was
consigned
to
the
stable
with
a
sigh
camp
life
had
more
pleasures
than
hardships
there
were
three
windows
in
our
room
which
we
opened
at
night
but
notwithstanding
the
air
that
circulated
the
feeling
after
having
been
so
long
out
of
doors
was
suffocating
the
ceiling
seemed
descending
to
smother
us
there
was
one
joy
reveillé
could
ring
out
on
the
dawning
day
and
there
was
no
longer
imperative
necessity
to
spring
from
a
warm
bed
and
make
ablutions
in
there
is
a
good
deal
of
that
sort
of
mental
snapping
of
the
fingers
on
the
part
of
campaigners
when
they
are
again
stationary
and
need
not
prepare
for
a
march
civilization
and
a
must
now
be
assumed
as
it
would
no
longer
do
to
rough
it
and
ignore
appearances
after
we
had
moved
into
a
house
and
were
to
live
like
folks
besides
we
soon
began
to
be
invited
by
the
townspeople
to
visit
them
refined
agreeable
and
women
came
to
see
us
and
womanlike
we
ran
our
eyes
over
their
dresses
they
were
embroidered
and
trimmed
richly
with
lace
befo
the
war
finery
or
from
the
cargo
of
a
blockade
runner
but
it
was
all
strange
enough
in
such
an
isolated
state
almost
everything
was
then
brought
from
the
terminus
of
the
brenham
railroad
to
austin
miles
by
we
had
been
anxiously
expected
for
some
time
and
there
was
no
manner
of
doubt
that
the
arrival
of
the
division
was
a
great
relief
to
the
reputable
of
both
sides
they
said
so
frankly
the
returned
confederate
officers
and
the
rangers
as
well
as
the
newly
appointed
union
governor
texas
was
then
a
state
and
the
lawlessness
was
terrible
the
returned
confederate
soldiers
were
poor
and
did
not
know
how
to
set
themselves
to
work
and
in
many
instances
preferred
the
life
of
a
freebooter
it
was
so
easy
if
a
crime
was
committed
to
slip
into
mexico
for
though
it
was
inaccessible
except
by
stage
or
on
horseback
a
texan
would
not
mind
a
forced
march
over
the
country
to
the
rio
grande
there
were
then
but
one
or
two
short
railroads
in
operation
the
one
from
galveston
to
brenham
was
the
principal
one
while
telegraph
lines
were
not
in
use
the
stage
to
brenham
was
our
one
means
of
communication
with
the
outside
world
it
was
hard
for
the
citizens
who
had
remained
at
home
to
realize
that
war
was
over
and
some
were
unwilling
to
believe
there
ever
had
been
an
emancipation
proclamation
in
the
northern
part
of
the
state
they
were
still
buying
and
selling
slaves
the
lives
of
the
newly
appointed
united
states
officers
were
threatened
daily
and
it
was
an
uneasy
head
that
wore
the
gubernatorial
crown
i
thought
them
braver
men
than
many
who
had
faced
the
enemy
in
battle
the
unseen
lurking
foe
that
hides
under
cover
of
darkness
was
their
terror
they
held
themselves
valiantly
but
one
wife
and
daughter
were
on
my
mind
night
after
night
as
from
dark
till
dawn
they
slept
uneasily
and
started
from
their
rooms
out
into
the
halls
at
every
strange
sound
the
general
and
i
thought
the
courageous
daughter
had
enough
brave
devoted
blood
in
her
veins
to
distill
a
portion
into
the
heart
of
many
a
soldier
who
led
a
forlorn
hope
they
told
us
that
in
the
early
part
of
the
war
the
girl
had
known
of
a
union
flag
in
the
state
house
held
in
derision
and
scornfully
treated
by
the
extremists
she
and
her
younger
brother
climbed
upon
the
roof
of
a
wing
of
the
building
after
dark
entered
a
window
of
the
capitol
found
the
flag
concealed
it
in
the
girl
clothing
and
made
their
perilous
descent
safely
the
father
of
such
a
daughter
might
well
prize
her
watchfulness
of
his
safety
as
she
vigilantly
kept
it
up
during
our
stay
and
was
equal
to
a
squadron
of
soldiers
she
won
our
admiration
and
our
bachelor
officers
paid
the
tribute
that
brave
men
always
pay
to
courageous
unselfish
women
for
she
danced
rode
and
walked
with
them
and
when
she
was
not
so
engaged
their
orderlies
held
their
horses
before
the
official
door
while
they
improved
every
hour
allowed
them
within
the
hospitable
portal
it
was
a
great
relief
to
find
a
southern
state
that
was
not
devastated
by
the
war
the
homes
destroyed
in
virginia
could
not
fail
to
move
a
woman
heart
as
it
was
women
and
children
that
suffered
from
such
destruction
in
texas
nothing
seemed
to
have
been
altered
i
suppose
some
profited
for
could
be
carried
on
from
the
ports
of
that
great
state
and
there
was
always
mexico
from
which
to
draw
supplies
in
our
daily
rides
we
found
the
country
about
austin
delightful
the
roads
were
smooth
and
the
surface
rolling
indeed
there
was
one
high
hill
called
mount
brunnel
where
we
had
picnics
and
enjoyed
the
fine
view
far
and
near
taking
one
of
the
bands
of
the
regular
regiments
from
the
north
that
joined
us
soon
after
our
arrival
mount
brunnel
was
so
steep
we
had
to
dismount
and
climb
a
part
of
the
distance
the
band
played
the
anvil
chorus
and
the
sound
descended
through
the
valley
grandly
the
river
filled
with
and
ugly
on
close
examination
looked
like
a
silver
ribbon
at
that
height
the
ripened
cotton
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
looked
like
fields
of
foam
the
thermometer
was
over
eighty
before
we
left
the
lowlands
but
at
the
altitude
to
which
we
climbed
the
air
was
cool
we
even
went
once
to
the
state
insane
asylum
taking
the
band
when
the
attendants
asked
if
dance
music
might
be
played
and
we
watched
with
wonder
the
quadrille
of
an
insane
eight
the
favorite
ride
for
my
husband
was
across
the
colorado
to
the
deaf
and
dumb
asylum
there
seemed
to
be
a
fascination
for
him
in
the
children
who
were
equally
charmed
with
the
young
soldier
that
silently
watched
their
pretty
pathetic
exhibitions
of
intelligent
speech
by
gesture
my
husband
riveted
his
gaze
on
their
speaking
eyes
and
as
their
instructor
spelt
the
passions
of
love
hatred
remorse
and
reverence
on
his
fingers
one
little
girl
represented
them
by
singularly
graceful
gestures
charming
him
and
filling
his
eyes
with
tears
which
he
did
not
seek
to
hide
the
pupils
were
from
ten
to
sixteen
years
of
age
their
supple
wrists
were
a
delight
to
us
and
the
tiny
hands
of
a
child
of
the
matron
whom
the
general
held
talked
in
a
cunning
way
to
its
playmates
who
it
knew
could
not
comprehend
its
speech
it
was
well
that
the
professor
was
hospitality
itself
and
did
not
mind
a
cavalcade
dashing
up
the
road
to
his
house
my
husband
when
he
did
not
openly
suggest
going
used
some
subterfuge
as
trivial
as
going
for
that
grew
in
a
pond
near
the
asylum
the
children
knew
him
and
welcomed
him
with
lustrous
eloquent
eyes
and
went
untiringly
through
their
little
exhibitions
learning
to
bring
him
their
compositions
examples
and
maps
for
his
commendation
how
little
we
thought
then
that
the
lessons
he
was
taking
in
order
to
talk
with
the
children
he
learned
to
love
would
soon
come
into
use
while
sitting
round
a
and
making
himself
understood
by
indians
of
course
their
is
wholly
their
own
but
it
is
the
same
method
of
using
the
simplest
signs
as
expressive
of
thought
it
was
a
long
pleasant
ride
its
only
drawback
to
me
being
the
fording
of
the
river
which
had
quicksands
and
a
rapid
current
the
colorado
was
low
but
the
was
wide
and
filled
with
the
mad
torrent
that
the
citizens
told
us
of
in
freshets
we
did
not
see
if
i
followed
my
husband
as
custis
lee
had
learned
to
do
i
found
myself
guided
safely
but
it
sometimes
happened
that
our
party
entered
the
river
laughing
and
talking
so
earnestly
noisily
and
excitedly
that
we
forgot
caution
one
lesson
was
enough
the
sensation
of
the
sinking
of
the
horse
hindlegs
in
quicksands
is
not
to
be
forgotten
the
loud
cry
of
the
general
to
saw
on
the
bit
or
whip
my
horse
excited
frightened
directions
from
the
staff
to
turn
to
the
right
or
the
left
custis
lee
trembling
and
snorting
with
fear
but
responding
to
a
sharp
cut
of
my
whip
for
i
rarely
struck
him
and
we
plunged
on
to
a
firmer
soil
wiser
for
all
the
future
on
account
of
that
moment
of
serious
peril
we
seldom
rode
through
the
town
as
my
husband
disliked
the
publicity
that
a
group
of
cavalrymen
must
necessarily
cause
in
a
city
street
if
we
were
compelled
to
the
staff
and
tom
pointed
out
one
after
another
of
the
loungers
about
the
stores
or
the
horseman
who
had
killed
his
man
it
seemed
to
be
thought
the
necessary
thing
to
establish
the
idea
of
courage
to
have
either
fought
in
duels
or
by
waylaying
the
enemy
to
have
killed
from
one
to
five
men
the
southern
climate
seems
to
keep
alive
a
feud
that
our
cold
northern
winters
freeze
out
bad
blood
was
never
kept
in
abeyance
they
had
out
their
bursts
of
temper
when
the
attack
of
rage
came
on
each
man
even
the
boys
of
twelve
went
armed
i
used
to
wonder
at
the
coats
until
a
norther
before
which
we
were
one
day
scudding
for
safety
lifted
the
coats
of
men
making
a
similar
dash
and
the
pistol
was
revealed
it
was
the
favorite
pastime
of
our
men
having
concocted
the
scheme
with
the
general
to
ride
near
some
of
the
outskirts
and
when
we
reached
some
lone
tree
tell
me
that
from
that
limb
a
murdered
man
had
lately
swung
this
grim
joke
was
often
practiced
on
me
in
order
that
the
shuddering
horror
and
the
start
custis
lee
and
i
made
to
skim
over
the
country
away
from
such
a
hated
spot
might
be
enjoyed
i
came
to
think
the
texas
trees
bore
that
human
fruit
a
little
too
often
for
truth
but
some
of
the
citizens
gloated
over
these
scenes
of
horror
and
added
a
in
town
to
the
list
of
localities
from
which
in
future
i
must
turn
away
my
head
the
negroes
in
texas
and
louisiana
were
the
worst
in
all
the
south
the
border
states
had
commonly
sold
their
most
insubordinate
slaves
into
these
two
distant
states
f
fortunately
our
now
division
and
the
regular
cavalry
kept
everything
in
a
better
condition
but
there
were
constantly
individual
cases
of
outrageous
conduct
and
often
of
crime
among
whites
and
blacks
high
and
low
texas
had
so
long
been
looked
upon
as
a
sort
of
city
of
refuge
by
outlaws
that
those
whom
the
other
states
refused
to
harbor
came
to
that
locality
a
country
reached
only
by
sea
from
the
south
or
by
a
from
the
north
and
through
which
no
telegraph
lines
ran
until
after
we
came
would
certainly
offer
an
admirable
for
those
who
leave
their
country
for
their
country
good
i
have
read
somewhere
that
texas
derived
its
name
from
a
group
of
rascals
who
sitting
around
a
fire
on
their
arrival
on
the
soil
that
was
to
protect
them
composed
this
couplet
if
every
other
land
forsakes
us
this
is
the
land
that
freely
takes
us
texas
as
story
after
story
reached
us
i
began
to
think
the
state
was
well
named
there
were
a
great
many
excellent
citizens
but
not
enough
to
leaven
the
lump
at
that
chaotic
period
even
the
women
learned
to
defend
themselves
as
the
war
had
deprived
them
of
their
natural
protectors
who
had
gone
either
in
the
northern
or
southern
army
for
texas
had
a
cavalry
regiment
of
refugees
in
our
service
one
woman
while
we
were
there
found
a
teamster
getting
into
her
window
and
shot
him
fatally
firearms
were
so
constantly
about
for
the
men
did
not
dress
without
a
pistol
in
their
belts
that
women
grew
accustomed
to
the
sight
of
weapons
there
was
a
woman
of
whom
i
constantly
heard
rich
and
refined
but
living
out
of
town
on
a
plantation
that
seemed
to
be
fit
only
for
negroes
she
rode
fearlessly
and
diverted
her
monotonous
life
by
hunting
the
planters
frequently
met
her
with
game
slung
upon
her
saddle
and
once
she
lassoed
and
brought
in
a
wolf
alone
finally
this
woman
came
to
see
me
but
curiosity
made
me
hardly
civil
for
a
few
moments
as
i
was
trying
to
reconcile
myself
to
the
knowledge
that
the
quiet
graceful
person
before
me
with
rich
dress
jewels
and
a
french
hat
could
take
her
gun
and
dogs
mount
a
fiery
horse
and
go
hunting
alone
we
found
on
returning
the
visit
that
though
they
were
rich
owning
blooded
horses
a
plantation
and
a
mill
their
domicile
was
anything
but
what
we
at
the
north
would
call
comfortable
it
was
a
long
log
building
consisting
of
a
parlor
bedroom
and
two
small
rooms
as
the
servants
said
all
opening
into
one
another
and
upon
the
porch
the
first
surprise
on
entering
was
that
the
roof
did
not
fit
down
snugly
on
the
side
wall
a
strip
of
the
blue
sky
was
visible
on
three
sides
while
the
partition
of
the
only
came
up
part
way
there
seemed
to
be
no
sort
of
provision
for
caudle
lectures
the
walls
were
roughly
plastered
but
this
space
just
under
the
roof
was
for
ventilation
and
i
fancied
they
would
get
enough
of
it
during
a
norther
i
am
reminded
of
a
story
that
one
of
the
witty
southern
women
told
me
after
repeating
some
very
good
comic
verses
in
which
they
excel
she
said
the
house
i
described
was
not
uncommon
in
texas
and
that
once
she
was
traveling
over
a
portion
of
the
state
on
a
journey
of
great
suffering
as
she
was
accompanying
her
husband
remains
to
a
family
they
assisted
her
from
her
carriage
into
one
of
the
rooms
of
a
long
log
house
used
as
a
wayside
inn
and
the
landlady
kindly
helped
her
into
bed
as
she
was
prostrated
with
suffering
and
fatigue
after
she
left
her
the
landlady
seemed
to
forget
that
the
partition
did
not
extend
to
the
rafters
and
began
questioning
her
servant
as
to
what
was
the
matter
etc
hearing
that
the
lady
had
lost
her
husband
the
old
dame
exclaimed
sympathetically
poor
thing
poor
thing
i
know
how
it
is
i
lost
three
of
em
the
general
and
his
staff
got
a
good
deal
of
sport
out
of
the
manner
in
which
they
exaggerated
the
tales
of
bloodshed
to
me
and
aroused
the
anger
grief
and
horror
that
i
could
not
suppress
i
must
defend
myself
from
the
supposition
that
i
may
have
been
chronicling
their
absurd
and
highly
colored
tales
all
that
i
have
written
i
have
either
seen
or
have
reliable
authority
for
their
astounding
stories
composed
among
themselves
began
with
a
concocted
plan
by
which
one
casually
started
a
story
the
others
met
it
with
surprise
and
with
an
is
it
possible
and
the
next
led
up
to
some
improbable
narrative
of
the
general
i
growing
more
and
more
shivery
as
the
wicked
tormentors
advanced
always
rather
gullible
i
suppose
i
must
confess
the
torn
and
distracted
state
of
society
in
texas
made
everything
they
said
seem
probable
i
know
how
long
i
kept
up
a
fashion
of
starting
and
shuddering
over
the
frequent
crack
of
a
rifle
or
pistol
as
we
rode
through
the
woods
about
the
town
my
husband
and
his
attendant
scamps
did
all
they
could
to
confirm
my
belief
that
the
woods
were
full
of
assassins
and
i
rode
on
after
these
sharp
reports
expecting
to
come
upon
the
lifeless
remains
of
a
murdered
man
they
all
said
with
feeling
that
texas
was
an
awful
country
in
which
to
live
where
a
man
life
was
not
safe
an
hour
and
excitedly
exclaimed
at
each
shot
there
goes
some
other
poor
fellow
i
have
reason
to
believe
it
was
a
serious
disappointment
to
the
whole
confederation
of
jokers
to
have
me
actually
see
a
mexican
driver
a
greaser
crack
his
whip
over
the
heads
of
his
oxen
as
they
crawled
along
in
front
of
us
one
day
when
we
were
riding
there
is
no
sound
like
the
snap
of
the
lash
of
a
as
they
are
called
and
perhaps
brighter
women
than
i
am
might
have
been
taken
in
by
it
and
thought
it
a
this
ended
my
taking
it
as
the
signal
of
a
death
the
lawlessness
of
the
state
was
much
diminished
by
the
troops
scattered
through
the
country
general
custer
was
much
occupied
in
answering
communications
that
came
from
distant
parts
of
texas
describing
the
demoralized
state
of
the
country
and
asking
for
troops
these
appeals
were
from
all
sides
it
was
felt
more
and
more
that
the
presence
of
the
troops
was
absolutely
necessary
and
it
was
certainly
agreeable
to
us
that
we
were
not
looked
upon
as
invaders
the
general
then
had
thirteen
regiments
of
infantry
and
as
many
of
cavalry
scattered
in
every
part
of
the
state
comprised
in
his
district
the
regular
troops
arriving
brought
their
wives
and
daughters
and
it
was
a
great
addition
as
we
had
constant
entertainments
in
which
the
civilians
so
long
cut
off
from
all
gayety
were
glad
to
participate
the
staff
assisted
me
greatly
in
my
preparations
we
dressed
the
long
parlors
in
evergreens
made
canopies
of
flags
arranged
in
impromptu
wooden
sconces
and
with
the
waxed
floor
it
was
tempting
enough
to
those
who
cared
for
dancing
the
soldiers
soon
organized
a
string
band
and
a
sergeant
called
off
the
quadrilles
sometimes
my
husband
planned
and
arranged
the
suppers
alone
but
usually
the
staff
divided
the
duty
of
preparing
the
refreshments
occasionally
we
attempted
a
dinner
and
as
we
wanted
to
invite
our
own
ladies
as
well
as
some
from
the
regular
regiments
the
table
was
a
subject
of
study
for
when
twenty
came
the
dishes
gave
out
the
staff
dined
early
so
that
we
could
have
theirs
and
the
southern
woman
who
occupied
two
rooms
in
the
building
lent
everything
she
had
uncle
charley
our
cook
who
now
had
found
a
colored
church
in
which
to
preach
on
sunday
did
up
all
his
religion
on
that
day
and
swore
all
the
week
but
the
was
distant
and
besides
my
husband
used
to
argue
that
it
was
just
as
well
to
endure
placidly
the
evils
right
about
us
but
not
to
seek
for
more
the
swearing
did
not
interfere
with
the
cooking
and
charley
thought
it
necessary
to
thus
clear
the
kitchen
as
our
yard
at
that
time
was
black
with
the
colored
race
each
servant
had
his
circle
of
friends
and
they
hovered
round
us
like
a
dark
cloud
the
dishes
that
uncle
charley
sent
up
were
excellent
the
texas
beef
and
poultry
were
of
superior
quality
and
we
even
had
a
respite
from
condensed
milk
as
a
citizen
had
lent
us
a
cow
at
one
of
these
dinners
eliza
had
enlisted
a
colored
boy
to
help
her
wait
on
the
table
i
had
tried
to
borrow
enough
dishes
and
thought
the
table
was
provided
but
the
glory
of
the
occasion
departed
when
after
soup
roast
game
all
served
with
the
great
luxury
at
that
place
of
separate
plates
uncle
charley
bethought
himself
that
he
would
add
as
a
surprise
a
dessert
it
is
almost
unnecessary
to
say
that
a
dessert
at
that
time
was
an
event
uncle
charley
said
his
best
holt
was
on
meats
and
his
attempts
at
pastry
would
not
only
have
ruined
the
remnant
of
his
temper
but
i
am
afraid
if
often
indulged
in
would
have
effectually
finished
our
digestion
for
this
i
had
not
counted
and
to
my
dismay
after
the
pudding
had
been
deposited
with
great
salaam
and
ceremony
before
the
general
the
colored
boy
rushed
around
and
gathered
everybody
until
he
returned
them
washed
and
placed
them
at
the
head
of
the
table
i
did
not
imagine
what
he
was
doing
i
simply
waited
in
that
uncertain
frame
of
mind
that
a
hostess
well
knows
my
husband
looked
at
the
array
of
cups
down
the
long
table
standing
bereft
of
their
partners
laid
his
head
back
and
shouted
then
everybody
else
laughed
and
very
red
and
very
mortified
i
concluded
to
admit
that
i
had
not
arranged
for
this
last
course
and
that
on
that
table
were
the
united
contents
of
all
our
and
there
were
no
saucers
or
nearer
than
town
we
were
aware
that
our
stay
in
the
south
was
limited
and
made
no
effort
to
keep
enough
crockery
for
dinners
of
twenty
after
many
enjoyable
parties
in
our
parlor
we
received
a
pathetic
and
carefully
worded
hint
from
eliza
who
was
now
a
great
belle
that
she
would
like
to
return
some
of
the
hospitality
shown
her
by
the
colored
people
of
the
town
and
my
husband
was
only
too
glad
to
prove
to
eliza
how
we
valued
her
faithful
life
in
our
service
we
composed
an
invitation
in
which
miss
eliza
brown
presented
her
compliments
to
washington
or
jefferson
as
the
case
might
be
and
would
be
happy
to
see
him
on
such
an
evening
with
the
word
dancing
in
the
corner
a
gathering
of
the
darkeys
seemed
equally
jubilant
whether
it
was
a
funeral
a
or
a
dance
but
it
seemed
they
made
a
difference
in
dress
for
these
occasions
if
not
in
manners
so
it
was
best
eliza
thought
to
add
dancing
though
it
was
only
at
first
a
mirthful
suggestion
of
the
general
fertile
brain
he
gave
the
copying
to
the
office
clerk
who
being
a
professional
penman
put
as
many
tails
to
his
capitals
and
flourishes
to
his
words
as
he
did
for
the
white
folks
eliza
critical
eye
watching
for
any
less
elaborate
embellishment
the
lower
part
of
the
house
was
given
over
to
the
negroes
who
polished
the
floor
trimmed
the
windows
columns
and
chimney
with
garlands
of
and
lavished
candles
on
the
scene
while
at
the
supper
they
had
a
heterogeneous
jumble
of
just
what
they
asked
for
including
coon
the
dish
garnished
with
watercress
and
bits
of
boiled
beet
i
think
we
were
not
asked
but
as
the
fiddle
started
the
jigs
the
general
feet
began
to
keep
time
and
he
executed
some
around
our
room
and
then
extracting
as
usual
a
promise
from
me
not
to
laugh
he
dragged
me
down
the
steps
and
we
hid
where
we
saw
it
all
the
quadrille
ended
the
order
of
ceremonies
seemed
to
consist
in
the
company
going
down
to
one
end
of
the
room
in
response
to
an
order
from
uncle
charley
to
the
flo
then
the
old
man
of
sixty
a
grandfather
now
dressed
in
white
tie
vest
and
gloves
with
shining
black
clothes
took
the
floor
he
knew
himself
to
be
the
cynosure
of
all
eyes
and
bore
himself
accordingly
he
had
previously
said
to
me
i
expects
miss
libbie
to
put
down
some
steps
those
colored
folks
has
never
seen
befo
and
surely
he
did
he
ambled
out
as
lithe
as
a
youngster
cut
some
and
then
skipped
and
flung
himself
about
with
the
agility
of
a
boy
stopping
not
only
for
breath
but
to
watch
the
expressions
envious
and
admiring
of
the
spectators
at
the
end
of
the
room
when
his
last
breath
was
exhausted
aunt
ann
our
old
laundress
came
tripping
down
the
polished
floor
and
executed
a
shuffle
most
decorous
at
first
and
then
reviving
her
youth
she
struck
into
a
hoydenish
jig
her
son
encouraging
her
by
patting
time
more
quadrilles
then
another
clearing
of
the
floor
and
a
young
yellow
woman
pirouetted
down
the
room
in
bright
green
tarlatan
petticoats
very
short
and
airy
she
executed
a
hornpipe
and
a
reel
and
like
uncle
charley
improvised
some
steps
for
the
occasion
this
black
sylph
was
surrounded
with
a
cloud
of
diaphanous
drapery
she
wreathed
her
arms
about
her
head
kept
on
the
smirk
of
the
and
coquetted
and
skipped
about
with
manners
that
brought
down
the
house
the
fattest
darkey
of
all
waddled
down
next
and
did
a
breakdown
at
which
all
the
assembly
patted
juba
and
with
their
woolly
heads
kept
time
to
the
violin
my
husband
never
moved
from
his
but
chuckled
and
shook
over
the
sight
novel
to
us
till
eliza
found
us
out
and
forgave
the
peeking
the
clothes
worn
looked
as
if
the
of
a
theatre
had
been
rifled
faded
finery
fag
ends
of
old
lace
tumbled
flowers
that
had
done
duty
at
many
a
white
folks
ball
on
the
pretty
costume
of
the
missus
old
feathers
set
up
in
the
wool
where
what
was
left
of
the
plume
bobbed
and
quavered
as
the
head
of
the
owner
moved
to
the
time
of
the
music
or
nodded
and
swayed
back
and
forth
while
conversation
was
kept
up
the
braiding
oiling
and
smoothing
had
gone
on
for
days
previous
to
straighten
the
wool
and
make
it
lie
flat
but
the
activity
in
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
soon
set
the
little
kinks
free
and
each
hair
stood
on
tiptoe
joining
in
a
jig
of
its
own
the
powder
begged
from
the
of
the
missus
was
soon
swept
away
in
the
general
shine
but
the
belles
cared
little
for
having
suspended
temporarily
the
breath
of
their
rivals
by
the
gorgeousness
of
their
toilettes
they
forgot
appearances
and
yielded
to
that
absorption
of
excitement
in
which
the
colored
soul
is
spellbound
eliza
moved
about
queening
it
as
she
knew
how
to
do
and
it
was
a
proud
hour
of
triumph
to
her
as
she
cast
a
complacent
side
glance
at
the
tail
of
her
gown
which
she
had
wheedled
out
of
me
by
cunning
arguments
among
which
the
most
powerful
was
that
was
getting
so
mussed
and
was
no
sort
of
a
dress
for
a
ginnel
wife
no
how
the
general
lost
nothing
for
he
sat
in
our
hidden
corner
shaking
and
throwing
his
head
back
in
glee
but
keeping
a
close
and
warning
hold
on
my
arm
as
i
was
not
so
successful
in
smothering
a
titter
as
he
was
having
no
mustache
to
deaden
the
sound
after
eliza
discovered
us
she
let
no
one
know
of
our
perfidy
and
the
company
believing
they
were
alone
abandoned
themselves
to
complete
enjoyment
as
the
fiddle
played
havoc
with
the
heels
of
the
entire
assembly
footnotes
e
in
a
town
of
mexico
last
year
i
saw
these
small
looms
with
blankets
in
them
in
various
stages
of
progress
in
many
cottages
among
the
indians
the
rude
loom
is
carried
about
in
the
mountain
villages
and
with
some
tribes
there
is
a
superstition
about
finishing
the
blankets
in
the
same
place
where
they
were
begun
a
squaw
will
sometimes
have
one
half
done
and
if
an
order
is
given
her
she
will
not
break
over
her
rule
to
finish
it
if
a
move
is
made
in
the
midst
of
her
work
she
waits
until
the
next
year
when
her
people
return
to
the
same
camp
as
is
the
custom
when
the
indian
seeks
certain
game
or
grazing
or
to
cut
longer
poles
f
in
order
to
gain
some
idea
of
the
immense
territory
in
which
our
troops
were
attempting
to
restore
order
i
have
only
to
remind
the
reader
that
texas
is
larger
than
either
the
german
or
the
austrian
empire
the
area
of
the
state
is
square
miles
it
is
as
large
as
france
belgium
england
and
wales
all
combined
if
we
could
place
the
northwestern
corner
of
texas
at
chicago
its
most
southerly
point
would
be
at
jacksonville
its
most
easterly
at
petersburg
and
its
most
westerly
in
the
interior
of
missouri
it
would
thus
cover
the
entire
states
of
indiana
kentucky
and
the
two
carolinas
and
nearly
all
of
tennessee
with
of
ohio
of
virginia
half
of
georgia
and
portions
of
florida
alabama
illinois
and
missouri
the
cities
of
chicago
toledo
cincinnati
washington
richmond
charleston
atlanta
and
nashville
would
all
be
included
within
its
borders
chapter
viii
letters
home
the
trivial
events
of
our
daily
life
were
chronicled
in
a
weekly
letter
home
and
from
a
number
of
these
effusions
i
cull
a
few
items
as
they
give
an
idea
of
my
husband
recreations
as
well
as
his
duties
we
are
quartered
in
the
blind
asylum
which
is
large
and
comfortable
the
large
rooms
in
the
main
part
of
the
building
we
can
use
for
entertaining
while
the
staff
occupy
the
wings
and
the
building
in
the
yard
that
was
used
for
a
schoolroom
out
there
they
can
have
all
the
and
they
choose
without
any
one
hearing
them
our
room
is
large
and
mother
i
have
two
bureaus
and
a
wardrobe
and
lose
my
things
constantly
i
am
so
unused
to
so
much
room
we
women
hardly
knew
what
to
make
of
the
absence
of
as
the
house
is
otherwise
furnished
until
it
occurred
to
us
that
the
former
occupants
would
get
much
good
out
of
a
mirror
it
is
so
necessary
to
have
one
after
all
as
i
got
on
all
summer
very
well
after
i
learned
to
brush
my
hair
straight
back
and
not
try
to
part
it
i
have
a
mirror
now
and
am
wrestling
with
back
hair
again
i
confess
to
you
mother
it
is
a
comfort
to
get
out
of
bed
on
to
a
carpet
and
dress
by
a
fire
but
do
tell
armstrong
i
said
so
as
i
never
mentioned
to
him
that
dressing
before
day
my
eyes
streaming
with
tears
from
the
while
i
took
an
bath
was
not
the
mode
of
serving
my
country
that
i
could
choose
last
sunday
it
was
uncomfortably
warm
we
wore
thin
summer
clothes
and
were
languid
from
the
heat
the
thermometer
was
in
the
shade
on
monday
the
weather
changed
from
heat
to
cold
in
five
minutes
in
consequence
of
the
sudden
and
violent
winds
which
are
called
no
one
prepares
for
the
cold
in
this
country
but
there
was
a
general
scattering
when
our
first
norther
attacked
us
tom
rushed
for
wood
and
of
course
none
was
cut
he
fished
tex
out
from
the
kitchen
borrowed
an
axe
from
one
of
the
headquarters
men
and
soon
appeared
with
an
armful
as
he
took
the
sticks
from
tex
to
build
the
fire
out
dropped
a
scorpion
to
add
to
the
excitement
it
was
torpid
but
nevertheless
it
was
a
scorpion
and
i
took
my
usual
safe
position
in
the
middle
of
the
bed
till
there
was
an
da
the
loose
windows
rattled
and
the
wind
howled
around
the
corner
of
our
room
i
put
a
sack
and
shawl
over
my
summer
dress
and
we
shivered
over
tom
fire
i
rather
wondered
at
armstrong
huddling
as
he
is
usually
so
warm
but
each
act
of
these
boys
needs
investigating
by
and
by
he
went
off
to
write
while
father
custer
took
out
his
pipe
to
calm
the
troubled
scene
into
which
the
rush
of
nova
zembla
had
thrown
us
he
sat
under
the
mantel
to
let
the
go
up
the
chimney
pretty
soon
autie
returned
and
threw
some
waste
paper
on
the
fire
and
the
next
thing
we
all
started
violently
back
from
a
wild
pyrotechnic
display
with
the
papers
went
in
a
handful
of
blank
cartridges
and
these
scamps
faced
their
father
and
calmly
asked
him
why
he
had
jumped
across
the
room
they
often
repeat
this
exhibition
with
either
tied
to
his
chair
or
tossed
carelessly
on
the
burning
logs
when
his
attention
is
attracted
elsewhere
but
do
pity
him
mother
no
matter
what
trick
they
play
he
is
never
phased
he
matches
them
too
and
i
help
him
though
i
am
obliged
to
confess
i
often
join
in
the
laugh
it
is
all
so
funny
this
was
not
the
last
of
the
hullabaloo
the
wood
gave
out
and
autie
descended
for
more
tex
took
this
occasion
when
everyone
was
hunting
a
fire
and
shelter
from
the
cold
to
right
what
he
considered
a
grievous
wrong
autie
found
him
belaboring
another
colored
boy
whom
he
had
autie
investigated
for
if
tex
was
right
he
was
bound
to
let
the
fight
proceed
you
know
in
his
west
point
days
he
was
arrested
for
allowing
a
fisticuff
to
go
on
and
because
he
said
back
boys
and
have
a
fair
fight
but
finding
our
boy
in
the
wrong
he
arraigned
him
and
began
you
strike
jake
with
malice
aforethought
sah
no
sah
i
dun
struck
him
with
the
back
of
the
hatchet
at
this
autie
found
himself
no
longer
a
righteous
judge
this
daniel
beat
a
quick
retreat
red
with
suppressed
laughter
and
made
tom
go
down
to
do
the
punishing
tom
shut
tex
in
the
but
it
was
hard
for
me
to
see
from
my
window
his
shiny
eyes
looking
out
from
between
the
slats
so
they
made
the
sentence
light
and
he
was
set
free
in
the
afternoon
now
mother
i
have
established
the
only
yankee
in
texas
i
do
mean
to
be
caught
again
and
shrivel
up
as
we
did
this
time
you
do
know
how
these
storms
deceive
you
one
hour
we
are
so
suffocated
with
the
heavy
oppressive
air
we
sit
in
the
deep
and
pant
for
breath
along
comes
a
roaring
sound
through
the
and
there
a
scatter
i
can
tell
you
we
bang
down
the
windows
and
shout
for
texas
to
hunt
the
jump
into
warm
clothes
and
before
we
are
fairly
prepared
the
hurricane
is
upon
us
we
really
do
mind
it
a
bit
as
it
does
last
long
once
it
lasted
three
days
besides
it
is
so
good
to
be
in
something
that
is
going
to
blow
down
as
we
momentarily
expected
in
a
tent
our
sundays
pass
so
slowly
the
holds
a
good
many
and
we
do
mind
close
quarters
so
we
all
squeeze
in
and
the
bachelor
officers
ride
with
us
to
church
the
episcopal
church
is
still
open
but
as
they
have
no
fires
we
would
be
glad
if
the
rector
warmed
us
up
with
his
eloquence
a
little
more
however
it
church
and
we
begin
to
feel
the
citizens
are
constantly
coming
to
pay
their
respects
to
armstrong
you
see
we
were
welcomed
instead
of
dreaded
as
yankees
or
no
yankees
a
man
life
is
just
as
good
preserved
by
a
federal
soldier
as
by
a
confederate
and
everybody
seems
to
be
in
a
terrified
state
in
this
lawless
land
among
the
callers
is
one
man
that
will
interest
you
father
i
believe
you
are
considered
authority
on
the
history
of
the
fight
that
took
place
at
monroe
when
the
kentucky
regiment
fought
the
british
in
well
whom
do
you
think
we
have
found
down
here
but
the
old
colonel
groome
who
distinguished
himself
that
day
he
is
a
old
soldier
and
when
autie
told
him
that
we
were
right
from
monroe
he
was
so
affected
the
tears
came
to
his
eyes
it
was
he
that
set
the
barn
on
fire
to
prevent
the
british
using
it
as
a
fortification
for
he
crawled
away
from
the
burning
building
on
his
hands
and
knees
while
their
bullets
cut
his
clothes
and
wounded
him
several
times
years
afterward
he
met
an
old
british
officer
who
told
him
in
their
talk
that
the
man
who
fired
the
barn
was
killed
by
his
own
army
but
colonel
groome
in
quite
a
dramatic
way
said
i
am
the
man
he
says
that
he
would
like
to
see
you
so
much
autie
is
greatly
interested
in
this
veteran
and
we
are
going
to
call
on
him
and
get
two
game
chickens
he
is
to
give
us
now
father
do
wrinkle
up
your
brows
when
i
tell
you
that
we
race
horses
even
i
race
with
l
and
much
as
you
may
disapprove
i
know
my
father
too
well
not
to
be
sure
he
will
be
glad
that
his
only
daughter
beat
but
let
me
explain
to
you
that
racing
among
ourselves
is
not
your
idea
of
it
there
is
no
money
at
stake
no
rough
crowd
none
of
the
evils
of
which
you
may
well
disapprove
as
we
know
at
home
armstrong
is
considered
the
best
judge
of
a
horse
here
the
texans
supposed
no
one
in
the
world
could
ride
as
well
as
themselves
and
they
do
ride
splendidly
but
those
who
saw
armstrong
keep
his
place
in
the
saddle
when
don
juan
ran
away
with
him
at
the
grand
review
in
washington
concede
that
he
does
know
how
to
ride
however
mistaken
his
views
on
patriotism
may
be
we
have
now
three
running
horses
and
a
fast
pony
none
of
which
has
beaten
autie
bay
pony
beat
a
crack
runner
of
which
the
town
boasts
by
three
full
lengths
the
races
are
near
our
quarters
so
we
women
can
be
in
it
all
indeed
there
is
nothing
they
do
not
share
with
us
our
is
a
tiny
mulatto
a
handsome
little
fellow
weighing
about
eighty
pounds
armstrong
thinks
he
is
the
finest
rider
he
has
ever
seen
i
have
just
made
him
a
red
jacket
and
a
skull
cap
to
ride
in
at
races
we
are
running
out
to
the
stables
half
our
time
armstrong
has
the
horses
exercised
on
a
track
holds
the
watch
and
times
them
as
we
sit
round
and
enjoy
their
speed
when
i
am
so
intent
on
my
amateur
dressmaking
and
perplexed
and
tired
dear
mother
you
would
wonder
when
i
tell
you
that
one
dress
of
which
i
am
in
actual
need
i
cut
so
that
the
figure
ran
one
way
on
the
skirt
and
another
on
the
waist
and
caused
armstrong
to
make
some
ridiculous
remarks
that
i
tried
not
to
notice
but
he
was
so
funny
and
the
dress
itself
was
so
very
queer
when
i
put
it
on
i
had
to
give
in
well
when
i
am
so
bothered
he
comes
in
and
throws
my
things
all
over
the
room
kicks
over
the
lapboard
and
picks
me
up
for
a
tramp
to
the
stable
then
he
rubs
down
the
horses
legs
and
asks
me
to
notice
this
or
that
fine
point
which
is
all
greek
to
me
the
truth
is
that
i
would
rather
see
a
fine
mane
and
tail
than
all
the
sinew
length
of
limb
etc
then
we
sit
down
on
kegs
and
boxes
and
contemplate
our
wealth
custis
lee
greets
me
with
a
whinny
dear
mother
you
would
be
simply
horrified
by
our
back
yard
autie
and
i
march
to
the
stables
through
a
dark
cloud
of
spectators
the
negroes
are
upon
us
like
the
locusts
of
egypt
it
is
rumored
that
our
uncle
charley
keeps
a
flourishing
colored
in
the
town
from
what
is
decidedly
more
than
the
crumbs
that
fall
from
his
master
table
after
all
though
considering
our
house
is
filled
with
company
and
we
constantly
give
evening
parties
i
do
think
our
are
very
large
autie
teases
father
custer
by
telling
him
he
is
going
to
brigade
the
colored
troops
and
make
him
chaplain
you
are
well
aware
how
father
custer
feels
over
the
question
and
how
he
would
regard
a
chaplaincy
i
must
not
forget
to
tell
you
that
the
wheel
of
time
has
rolled
around
and
among
the
regiments
in
armstrong
command
is
the
fourth
michigan
infantry
you
remember
that
when
he
was
a
second
lieutenant
he
crossed
the
chickahominy
with
that
regiment
and
how
having
started
before
dawn
his
comrades
among
whom
he
had
just
come
did
not
know
him
till
while
they
were
lying
low
he
would
pop
up
his
head
and
call
out
their
first
names
or
their
nicknames
at
school
in
monroe
and
when
it
was
daylight
and
they
recognized
him
how
glad
they
were
to
see
him
we
had
a
lovely
christmas
i
fared
beautifully
as
some
of
our
staff
had
been
to
san
antonio
where
the
stores
have
a
good
many
beautiful
things
from
mexico
here
we
had
little
opportunity
to
buy
anything
but
i
managed
to
get
up
some
trifle
for
each
of
our
circle
we
had
a
large
and
autie
was
santa
claus
and
handed
down
the
presents
making
remarks
as
each
person
walked
up
to
receive
his
gift
the
tree
was
well
lighted
i
do
know
how
so
many
tapers
were
gotten
together
of
course
it
would
not
be
if
with
all
the
substantial
gifts
some
jokes
were
not
slipped
in
you
know
well
father
custer
antipathy
to
the
negro
and
everybody
gathered
round
to
see
him
open
a
box
containing
a
nigger
doll
baby
while
two
of
his
other
parcels
held
a
bunch
of
and
a
bunch
of
cards
lately
his
sons
have
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
and
argument
trying
to
induce
him
to
play
they
at
last
taught
him
some
simple
game
easy
enough
for
even
me
to
master
the
rogues
let
him
beat
at
first
but
finally
he
discovered
his
luck
was
so
persistently
bad
there
must
be
a
screw
loose
and
those
boys
up
to
some
rascality
they
had
put
him
with
no
apparent
intention
with
his
back
to
the
mirror
and
of
course
saw
his
hand
which
like
an
amateur
he
awkwardly
held
just
right
to
enable
them
to
see
all
his
cards
this
ended
his
lessons
and
we
will
return
him
to
monroe
the
same
good
old
methodist
that
he
left
it
everybody
is
fond
of
him
and
his
real
presents
were
a
hat
handkerchief
necktie
pipe
and
tobacco
one
of
our
lieutenants
having
just
received
his
brevet
as
major
had
a
huge
pair
of
yellow
leaves
cut
out
of
flannel
as
his
insignia
for
the
new
rank
one
of
the
staff
now
a
teetotaler
was
reminded
of
his
past
which
i
hoped
everyone
would
ignore
by
the
present
of
a
wooden
faucet
no
one
escapes
in
such
a
crowd
tom
who
is
always
drumming
on
the
piano
had
a
given
him
with
an
explanatory
line
from
autie
attached
give
the
piano
a
rest
only
our
own
military
family
were
here
and
armstrong
gave
us
a
nice
supper
all
of
his
own
getting
up
we
played
games
sang
songs
mostly
for
the
chorus
danced
and
finally
the
merriest
imitated
the
darkeys
by
jigs
and
patting
juba
and
the
rooms
were
prettily
trimmed
with
evergreens
and
over
one
door
a
great
branch
of
mistletoe
about
which
the
officers
sang
fair
mistletoe
love
opportunity
what
trees
that
grow
give
such
sweet
impunity
but
it
is
too
bad
that
pretty
as
two
or
three
of
our
women
are
they
belong
to
some
one
else
so
kissing
begins
and
ends
with
every
man
saluting
his
own
wife
i
wish
you
could
see
the
waxen
white
berries
and
the
green
leaves
of
the
parasite
on
the
naked
branches
of
the
trees
here
mother
and
oh
to
have
you
get
one
sniff
of
the
december
roses
which
rival
the
summer
ones
in
richness
of
color
and
perfume
would
make
my
pleasure
greater
i
assure
you
it
is
nearly
spring
here
and
the
grass
on
our
lawn
is
getting
green
and
the
farmers
began
to
plough
in
january
nettie
is
such
a
nurse
here
her
name
is
up
for
it
and
she
has
even
to
go
out
to
the
servants
quarters
if
the
little
nigs
burn
their
heels
or
toes
she
is
a
great
pleasure
to
us
all
and
enjoys
every
moment
it
seems
that
the
general
racing
of
which
i
wrote
to
my
father
was
too
tempting
for
me
to
resist
entirely
and
our
household
was
beguiled
one
day
into
a
promise
to
bring
my
husband
jack
rucker
down
to
the
citizens
track
every
one
was
confident
of
success
and
no
one
took
into
consideration
that
the
experiment
of
pitting
gentlemen
against
turf
roughs
has
never
been
successful
our
officers
entered
into
all
the
preparations
with
high
hopes
thinking
that
with
one
good
whipping
the
civilians
would
cease
to
send
bantering
messages
or
drag
presuming
before
their
eyes
they
were
accustomed
to
putting
their
steeds
to
their
best
speed
when
a
party
of
equestrians
from
our
headquarters
were
riding
in
their
vicinity
too
fond
of
good
horseflesh
not
to
admire
the
pace
at
which
their
thoroughbreds
sped
over
the
smooth
firm
roads
about
austin
there
was
still
a
murmured
word
passed
around
that
the
owners
of
these
fleet
animals
would
hang
their
proud
heads
when
jack
came
into
the
field
we
women
were
pressed
into
going
all
of
us
liked
the
trial
of
speed
on
our
own
territory
but
the
hatred
of
a
that
was
not
conducted
by
gentlemen
was
imbedded
deep
in
our
minds
the
officers
did
not
ask
us
to
go
for
good
luck
as
army
women
are
so
often
told
they
bring
it
but
they
simply
said
you
could
not
miss
seeing
our
jack
beat
off
we
went
a
gay
boisterous
party
till
we
reached
the
track
there
we
put
on
our
quietest
civilian
manners
and
took
our
place
to
watch
the
coming
triumph
the
track
was
good
and
the
texas
men
and
women
more
enthusiastic
over
a
horse
than
over
anything
else
in
the
world
cheered
their
blanketed
favorite
as
he
was
led
up
and
down
before
the
judge
stand
when
the
judge
gave
the
final
go
our
party
were
so
excited
and
our
hearts
so
swelling
with
assured
success
i
would
have
climbed
up
on
the
saddle
to
see
better
if
it
had
not
been
that
we
were
surrounded
with
strangers
off
went
the
beautiful
texas
horse
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
but
our
jack
in
spite
of
the
rider
sticking
the
spur
and
cruelly
cutting
his
silken
neck
with
the
whip
only
lumbered
around
the
first
curve
and
in
this
manner
laboriously
made
his
way
the
rest
of
the
distance
of
course
it
was
plain
that
we
were
frightfully
beaten
and
with
loud
and
triumphant
huzzas
the
texans
welcomed
their
winning
horse
long
before
poor
jack
dragged
himself
up
to
the
stand
our
officers
hurried
out
to
look
him
over
and
found
the
poor
brute
had
been
drugged
by
the
contesting
side
there
was
no
serious
injury
except
to
our
pride
we
were
too
disappointed
humiliated
and
infuriated
to
stand
upon
the
order
of
our
going
we
all
turned
our
backs
upon
the
crowd
and
fled
the
clatter
of
our
horses
hoofs
upon
the
hard
road
was
the
only
sound
as
none
of
us
spoke
my
husband
met
that
as
everything
else
as
nothing
worthy
of
serious
regret
and
after
the
tempest
of
fury
over
our
being
so
imposed
upon
i
rather
rejoiced
because
the
speed
of
our
horses
after
that
first
and
last
essay
was
confined
to
our
own
precincts
nobody
pocket
suffered
and
the
wounded
spirits
of
those
who
race
horses
are
more
easily
soothed
if
a
wounded
purse
has
not
to
be
borne
in
addition
there
was
one
member
of
our
family
to
whom
i
have
only
referred
who
was
our
daily
joy
it
was
the
pointer
ginnie
whom
the
virginia
family
in
hempstead
had
given
us
my
husband
made
her
a
bed
in
the
hall
near
our
room
and
she
did
every
cunning
intelligent
act
of
which
a
dog
is
capable
she
used
to
go
hunting
walking
and
riding
with
us
and
was
with
her
master
at
all
times
i
often
think
who
among
our
friends
pleases
us
on
all
occasions
how
few
there
are
who
do
not
rub
us
up
the
wrong
way
or
whom
we
ourselves
are
not
conscious
sometimes
of
boring
and
of
taxing
their
patience
and
do
we
not
find
that
we
sometimes
approach
those
of
whom
we
are
fond
and
discover
intuitively
that
they
are
not
in
sympathy
with
our
mood
and
we
must
bide
their
time
for
responding
to
our
overtures
with
that
dear
ginnie
there
was
no
question
she
received
us
exactly
in
the
spirit
with
which
we
approached
her
responded
with
measure
pressed
down
and
running
over
to
our
affectionate
demonstrations
and
the
blessed
old
girl
never
sulked
if
we
dropped
her
to
attend
to
something
else
george
eliot
says
animals
are
such
agreeable
friends
they
ask
no
questions
they
pass
no
criticisms
a
dog
is
so
human
to
me
and
dogs
have
been
my
husband
chosen
friends
so
many
years
i
can
not
look
upon
the
commonest
cur
with
indifference
sometimes
as
i
stand
now
at
my
window
longing
for
the
old
pack
that
whined
with
delight
quarreled
with
jealousy
for
the
best
place
near
us
capered
with
excitement
as
we
started
off
on
a
ride
or
walk
my
eyes
involuntarily
follow
each
dog
that
passes
on
the
street
i
look
at
the
master
to
see
if
he
realizes
that
all
that
is
faithful
and
loving
in
this
world
is
at
his
heels
if
he
stops
to
talk
to
a
friend
and
the
dog
leaps
about
him
licks
his
hand
rubs
against
him
and
tries
in
every
way
that
his
devoted
heart
teaches
him
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
one
who
is
all
the
world
to
him
all
my
sympathies
are
with
the
dog
i
watch
with
jealous
solicitude
to
see
if
the
affectionate
brute
gets
recognition
and
if
by
instinct
the
master
hand
goes
out
to
the
head
i
am
quite
as
glad
and
grateful
as
the
recipient
if
the
man
is
absorbed
and
lets
the
animal
sit
patiently
and
adoringly
watching
his
very
expression
it
seems
to
me
i
can
not
refrain
from
calling
his
attention
to
the
neglect
my
husband
was
as
courteous
in
responding
to
his
dogs
demonstrations
and
as
affectionate
as
he
would
be
to
a
person
if
he
sent
them
away
he
explained
in
dog
talk
the
reason
which
might
seem
absurd
if
our
canine
family
had
not
been
our
companions
so
constantly
that
they
seemed
to
understand
and
accept
his
excuses
as
something
unavoidable
on
his
part
the
men
of
our
family
so
appreciated
kindness
to
dogs
that
i
have
found
myself
this
winter
involuntarily
almost
calling
to
them
to
see
an
evidence
of
affection
one
of
my
neighbors
is
a
beer
saloon
and
though
i
am
too
busy
to
look
out
of
the
window
much
i
have
noticed
occasionally
an
old
express
horse
waiting
for
his
master
to
take
something
warming
the
blanket
was
humped
up
on
his
back
mysteriously
it
turned
out
to
be
a
dear
little
cur
which
was
thus
kept
warm
by
a
fond
master
it
recalls
our
men
and
the
ways
they
devised
for
keeping
their
dogs
warm
the
times
innumerable
when
they
shared
their
own
blankets
with
them
when
caught
out
in
a
cold
snap
or
divided
short
rations
with
the
dogs
they
loved
returning
to
ginnie
i
remember
a
day
when
there
was
a
strange
disappearance
she
did
not
thump
her
tail
on
the
door
for
entrance
fetching
our
stockings
in
her
mouth
as
a
gentle
hint
that
it
was
time
to
get
up
and
have
a
fire
if
the
morning
was
chilly
it
did
not
take
the
general
long
to
scramble
into
his
clothes
and
go
to
investigate
for
he
dearly
loved
her
and
missed
the
morning
call
soon
afterward
he
came
bounding
up
the
stairs
two
steps
at
a
time
to
announce
that
no
harm
had
come
to
our
favorite
but
that
seven
other
little
ginnies
were
now
taking
the
breakfast
provided
by
their
mother
under
the
negro
quarters
at
the
rear
of
the
house
there
was
great
rejoicing
and
preparations
to
celebrate
this
important
event
in
our
family
eliza
put
our
room
in
order
and
descended
to
the
kitchen
to
tell
what
antics
the
general
was
performing
over
the
animal
when
she
was
safely
where
she
could
not
intimidate
us
my
husband
and
i
departed
to
fetch
the
new
family
up
near
us
the
general
would
not
trust
any
one
with
the
responsibility
of
the
removal
he
crawled
under
the
building
which
was
set
up
on
low
piles
and
handed
out
the
baby
canines
one
by
one
to
me
ginnie
ran
beside
us
frantic
with
anxiety
but
her
eloquent
eyes
full
of
love
and
trust
in
our
intentions
her
bed
in
the
hall
was
hardly
good
enough
for
such
an
epoch
in
her
life
so
the
whole
litter
with
the
proud
mother
in
their
midst
was
safely
deposited
in
the
middle
of
our
bed
where
we
paid
court
to
this
royalty
my
husband
went
over
each
little
shapeless
body
and
called
my
special
attention
to
fine
points
that
for
the
life
of
me
as
i
was
i
could
not
discover
in
the
pulpy
little
rolls
as
he
took
them
up
one
by
one
ginnie
understood
every
word
of
praise
he
uttered
after
all
of
these
little
blind
atoms
had
been
returned
to
their
maternal
and
the
general
had
congratulated
the
mother
on
a
restaurant
where
he
said
the
advertisement
of
warm
meals
at
all
hours
was
for
once
true
he
immediately
set
about
tormenting
eliza
her
outraged
spirit
had
suffered
often
to
see
the
kingly
byron
reposing
his
head
on
the
pillow
but
the
general
said
we
must
get
her
for
there
will
be
war
in
the
camp
now
eliza
came
peacefully
up
the
stairs
into
our
room
but
her
eyes
blazed
when
she
saw
ginnie
she
asked
her
usual
question
did
i
come
way
off
down
in
this
here
no
country
to
wash
white
counterpanes
for
dogs
at
each
speech
the
general
said
something
to
ginnie
in
reply
to
harrow
her
up
more
and
more
and
at
last
she
had
to
give
in
and
laugh
at
some
of
his
drolleries
she
recalls
to
me
now
her
recollection
miss
libbie
do
you
mind
how
the
ginnel
landed
ginnie
and
her
whole
brood
of
pups
in
the
middle
of
the
bed
and
then
had
the
to
send
for
me
but
oh
it
was
perfectly
heartrendin
the
way
he
would
go
on
about
his
dogs
when
they
was
sick
and
we
both
remembered
when
one
of
these
little
puppies
of
our
beloved
ginnie
was
ill
how
he
walked
the
floor
half
the
night
holding
rubbing
trying
to
soothe
the
suffering
little
beast
and
in
spite
of
his
medical
treatment
for
he
kept
the
on
his
desk
and
ransacked
it
for
remedies
and
notwithstanding
the
anointing
and
the
coddling
two
died
after
eliza
had
come
down
from
her
rampagious
state
she
was
invited
to
take
notice
of
what
a
splendid
family
ginnie
had
then
all
the
staff
and
the
ladies
came
up
to
call
it
was
a
great
occasion
for
ginnie
but
she
bore
her
honors
meekly
and
offered
her
paw
as
was
her
old
custom
to
each
as
if
prepared
for
congratulations
when
they
were
old
enough
to
run
about
and
bark
ginnie
took
up
her
former
habit
of
following
at
the
general
heels
and
as
he
crossed
the
yard
to
the
stables
there
was
so
absurd
a
procession
that
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
commanding
officer
and
question
if
he
himself
thought
it
added
to
the
dignity
of
his
appearance
to
see
the
trail
of
mother
and
five
puppies
in
his
wake
the
independence
of
the
chief
was
too
inborn
to
be
laughed
to
scorn
about
appearances
and
so
he
continued
to
go
about
as
long
as
these
wee
toddlers
followed
their
mother
in
quest
of
supplies
i
believe
there
were
dogs
at
this
time
about
our
house
most
of
them
ours
even
our
father
custer
accepted
a
bulky
old
cur
as
a
gift
there
was
no
manner
of
doubt
about
the
qualities
that
had
influenced
our
persecuted
parent
in
selecting
this
one
from
the
numerous
dogs
offered
him
by
his
farmer
friends
his
choice
was
made
neither
on
account
of
breeding
nor
speed
the
cur
was
selected
solely
as
a
he
was
all
growl
and
bark
and
as
devotion
is
not
confined
fortunately
to
the
canines
of
exalted
paternity
the
lumbering
old
fellow
was
faithful
nothing
describes
him
better
than
some
lines
from
the
outside
dog
in
the
fight
for
though
he
could
threaten
with
savage
growls
and
i
fancy
when
aggravated
could
have
set
savage
teeth
in
the
enemy
of
his
master
he
trotted
beside
our
father
horse
very
peacefully
unmindful
of
the
quarrelsome
members
of
our
canine
family
who
bristled
up
to
him
inviting
an
encounter
merely
to
pass
the
time
you
may
sing
of
your
dog
your
bottom
dog
or
of
any
dog
that
you
please
i
go
for
the
dog
the
wise
old
dog
that
knowingly
takes
his
ease
and
wagging
his
tail
outside
the
ring
keeping
always
his
bone
in
sight
cares
not
a
pin
in
his
wise
old
head
for
either
dog
in
the
fight
not
his
is
the
bone
they
are
fighting
for
and
why
should
my
dog
sail
in
with
nothing
to
gain
but
a
certain
chance
to
lose
his
own
precious
skin
there
may
be
a
few
perhaps
who
fail
to
see
it
in
quite
this
light
but
when
the
fur
flies
i
had
rather
be
the
outside
dog
in
the
fight
affairs
had
come
to
such
a
pass
that
our
father
took
his
yellow
cur
into
his
bedroom
at
night
it
was
necessary
to
take
prompt
precautionary
measures
to
keep
his
sons
from
picking
the
lock
of
the
door
and
descending
on
him
in
their
marauding
expeditions
the
dog
saw
comparatively
little
of
outside
life
for
as
time
rounded
it
became
necessary
for
the
old
gentleman
to
shut
up
his
daytimes
also
as
he
found
in
his
absence
these
same
sons
and
their
confederates
had
a
fashion
of
dropping
a
little
nig
over
the
transom
with
directions
to
fetch
back
to
them
anything
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
i
have
seen
them
at
the
door
while
our
father
was
away
trying
to
soothe
and
cajole
the
old
guardian
of
his
master
effects
into
terms
of
peace
after
all
overtures
were
declined
and
the
little
bedroom
was
filled
up
with
bark
and
growl
the
invaders
contented
themselves
with
tossing
all
sorts
of
missiles
over
the
transom
which
did
not
sweeten
the
enraged
temper
nor
did
it
render
our
father
bed
as
downy
as
it
might
have
been
i
find
myself
recalling
with
a
smile
the
perfectly
satisfied
manner
in
which
this
ungainly
old
dog
was
taken
out
by
his
venerable
owner
on
our
rides
over
the
country
father
custer
had
chosen
him
not
for
his
beauty
but
as
his
companion
and
finding
him
so
successful
in
this
one
capacity
he
was
just
as
serene
over
his
possession
as
ever
his
sons
were
with
their
hunters
the
dog
looked
as
if
he
were
a
from
all
the
rough
clay
that
was
discarded
after
modeling
the
sleek
springy
dogs
of
our
pack
his
legs
were
massive
while
his
cumbersome
tail
curled
over
his
plebeian
back
in
a
tight
coil
until
he
was
tired
then
and
only
then
did
it
uncurl
the
droop
of
his
head
was
rendered
even
more
loppy
by
the
tongue
which
dropped
outside
the
sagging
jaw
but
for
all
that
he
lumbered
along
a
blotch
of
ungainly
yellow
beside
our
splendid
thoroughbreds
he
was
never
so
tired
that
he
could
not
understand
the
voice
of
a
proud
old
man
who
assured
his
retrograde
sons
that
he
would
match
his
bowser
any
of
their
unreliable
highfalutin
lot
it
was
a
strange
sight
though
this
one
plebeian
among
patricians
our
horses
were
fine
our
father
got
good
speed
and
some
style
out
of
his
nag
our
dogs
leaped
over
the
country
like
deer
and
there
in
the
midst
panting
and
faithfully
struggling
to
keep
up
was
the
rough
uncouth
old
fellow
too
absorbed
in
endeavoring
not
to
be
left
behind
to
realize
that
he
was
not
all
that
a
dog
could
finally
become
after
generations
of
training
and
breeding
had
done
its
refining
work
chapter
ix
disturbed
condition
of
texas
texas
was
in
a
state
of
ferment
from
one
end
to
the
other
there
was
then
no
network
of
railroads
running
over
its
vast
territory
as
there
is
now
lawless
acts
might
be
perpetrated
and
the
inciters
cross
the
rio
grande
into
mexico
before
news
of
the
depredations
came
to
either
military
or
civil
headquarters
the
regiments
stationed
at
various
points
in
the
state
had
no
easy
duty
jayhawkers
bandits
and
had
everything
their
own
way
for
a
time
i
now
find
through
official
reports
what
innumerable
perplexities
came
up
almost
daily
and
how
difficult
it
was
for
an
officer
in
command
of
a
division
to
act
in
perfect
justice
to
citizen
soldier
and
negro
it
was
the
most
natural
result
in
the
world
that
the
restless
throng
let
loose
over
the
state
from
the
confederate
service
should
do
what
idle
hands
usually
find
to
do
consider
what
a
land
of
tramps
we
were
at
the
north
after
the
war
and
if
in
our
prosperous
states
and
territories
when
so
many
business
industries
were
at
once
resumed
we
suffered
from
that
class
of
men
who
refused
to
work
and
kept
outside
the
pale
of
the
law
by
a
stealthy
existence
what
would
naturally
be
the
condition
of
affairs
in
a
country
like
texas
for
many
years
the
of
outlaws
my
own
father
was
one
of
the
most
patriotic
men
i
ever
knew
he
was
too
old
to
enter
the
service
an
aged
man
even
in
my
sight
for
he
had
not
married
till
he
was
forty
but
in
every
way
that
he
could
serve
his
country
at
home
he
was
foremost
among
the
elderly
patriots
of
the
north
i
remember
how
little
war
moved
me
the
clash
of
arms
and
glitter
of
the
soldiery
only
appealed
to
me
as
it
did
to
thoughtless
young
girls
still
without
soldier
lovers
or
brothers
who
lived
too
far
from
the
scenes
of
battle
to
know
the
tragic
side
but
my
father
impressed
me
by
his
sadness
his
tears
his
lamentations
over
our
country
misfortunes
he
was
the
first
in
town
to
get
the
news
from
the
front
and
so
eager
to
hear
the
result
of
some
awful
day
when
lives
were
being
lost
by
thousands
on
a
hotly
contested
field
that
he
walked
a
bleak
lonely
mile
to
the
telegraph
station
waiting
till
midnight
for
the
last
despatches
and
weeping
over
defeats
as
he
wearily
trod
the
long
way
homeward
i
remember
his
striding
up
and
down
the
floor
his
grand
head
bent
over
his
chest
in
grief
and
saying
so
solemnly
as
to
arrest
the
attention
of
my
stepmother
usually
absorbed
in
domestic
affairs
and
even
of
me
too
happy
then
with
the
very
exuberance
of
living
to
think
while
the
sadness
of
his
voice
touched
even
our
thoughtlessness
oh
the
worst
of
this
calamity
will
not
be
confined
to
war
our
land
even
after
peace
is
restored
will
be
filled
with
and
villains
the
prediction
came
true
immediately
in
texas
and
the
troops
had
to
be
stationed
over
the
extensive
territory
before
the
winter
was
over
the
civil
authorities
began
to
be
able
to
carry
out
the
laws
they
worked
as
they
were
obliged
to
do
in
connection
with
the
military
and
the
rioting
oppressions
and
assassinations
were
becoming
less
common
it
was
considered
unnecessary
to
retain
the
division
of
cavalry
as
an
organization
since
all
anticipated
trouble
with
mexico
was
over
and
the
troops
need
no
longer
be
massed
in
great
numbers
the
necessity
for
a
special
commander
for
the
cavalry
in
the
state
was
over
and
the
general
was
therefore
mustered
out
of
service
as
a
of
volunteers
and
ordered
north
to
await
his
assignment
to
a
new
station
we
had
very
little
to
do
in
preparation
as
our
camp
outfit
was
about
all
our
earthly
possessions
at
that
time
it
was
a
trial
to
part
with
the
elderly
dogs
which
were
hardly
worth
the
experiment
of
transporting
to
the
north
especially
as
we
had
no
reason
to
suppose
we
should
see
another
deer
except
in
zoological
gardens
the
hounds
fell
into
good
and
appreciative
hands
being
given
either
to
the
planter
who
had
presented
them
or
to
the
officers
of
the
regular
regiment
that
had
just
been
stationed
in
texas
for
a
detail
the
cow
was
returned
to
the
generous
planter
who
lent
her
to
us
she
was
now
a
fat
sleek
creature
compared
with
her
appearance
when
she
came
from
among
the
ranch
cattle
the
stables
were
emptied
and
our
brief
enjoyment
of
an
embryo
farm
with
a
diminutive
private
track
of
our
own
was
at
an
end
jack
rucker
custis
lee
phil
and
the
blooded
mare
were
to
go
but
the
great
bargains
in
fast
ponies
had
to
be
sacrificed
illustration
general
custer
at
the
close
of
the
war
aged
my
old
father
custer
had
been
as
concerned
about
my
horse
education
as
his
sons
he
also
tried
as
well
as
his
boys
to
attract
my
attention
from
the
flowing
manes
and
tails
by
which
alone
i
judged
the
merits
of
a
horse
to
the
shoulders
length
of
limb
withers
etc
one
day
there
came
an
incentive
for
perfecting
myself
in
horse
lore
for
my
husband
said
that
if
i
would
select
the
best
pony
in
a
number
we
then
owned
i
should
have
him
i
sat
on
a
keg
in
the
contemplating
the
heels
of
the
horses
and
wishing
fervently
i
had
listened
to
my
former
lessons
in
horseflesh
more
attentively
all
three
men
laughed
at
my
perplexities
and
even
the
soldiers
who
took
care
of
the
stable
retired
to
a
safe
place
to
smile
at
the
witticisms
of
their
commanding
officer
and
were
so
deplorably
susceptible
to
fun
that
even
the
wife
of
their
chief
was
a
subject
for
merriment
i
was
in
imminent
danger
of
losing
my
chance
at
owning
a
horse
and
might
to
this
day
have
remained
ignorant
of
the
peculiarly
proud
sensation
one
experiences
over
that
possession
if
my
father
custer
had
not
slyly
and
surreptitiously
come
over
to
my
side
how
he
cunningly
imparted
the
information
i
will
not
betray
but
since
he
was
as
good
a
judge
of
a
horse
as
his
sons
and
had
taught
them
their
wisdom
in
that
direction
it
is
needless
to
say
that
my
final
judgment
after
repeated
returns
to
the
stable
was
triumphant
texas
made
the
old
saw
read
all
is
fair
in
love
war
and
so
i
adapted
myself
to
the
customs
of
the
country
and
kept
the
secret
of
my
wise
judgment
until
the
money
that
the
pony
brought
forty
dollars
in
silver
was
safely
deposited
in
my
grasping
palm
i
will
not
repeat
the
scoffing
of
the
outwitted
pair
after
i
had
spent
the
money
at
libbie
but
content
myself
with
my
father
praise
at
the
gown
he
had
secured
to
me
when
i
enjoyed
at
the
north
the
serenity
of
mind
that
comes
of
silken
attire
the
planters
came
to
bid
us
and
we
parted
from
them
with
reluctance
we
had
come
into
their
state
under
trying
circumstances
and
the
cordiality
generosity
and
genuine
good
feeling
that
i
know
they
felt
made
our
going
a
regret
there
was
no
reason
why
they
should
come
from
their
distant
plantations
to
say
and
wish
us
godspeed
except
from
personal
friendship
and
we
all
appreciated
the
wish
they
expressed
that
we
might
remain
the
journey
from
austin
to
hempstead
was
made
much
more
quickly
than
our
march
over
we
had
relays
of
horses
the
roads
were
good
and
there
was
no
detention
i
only
remember
one
episode
of
any
importance
at
the
little
hotel
at
which
we
stopped
in
brennan
we
found
loitering
about
the
doors
and
stoop
and
inner
court
a
lounging
rough
lot
of
men
evidently
the
lower
order
of
confederate
soldiers
the
lawless
set
that
infest
all
armies
the
tramp
and
the
bummer
they
gathered
in
knots
to
watch
and
talk
of
us
as
we
passed
them
on
our
way
to
the
they
muttered
and
even
spoke
audibly
words
of
spiteful
insult
at
every
such
word
i
expected
the
fiery
blood
of
the
general
and
his
staff
would
be
raised
to
fighting
heat
but
they
would
not
descend
to
altercation
with
fellows
to
whom
even
the
presence
of
a
woman
was
no
restraint
it
was
a
mystery
it
still
is
to
me
that
men
can
control
themselves
if
they
consider
the
foeman
unworthy
of
the
steel
my
husband
was
ever
a
marvel
to
me
in
that
he
could
in
this
respect
carry
out
his
own
counsel
i
began
very
early
with
that
old
maxim
consider
the
source
as
a
subterfuge
for
the
lack
of
repartee
in
choking
senseless
wrath
but
it
came
to
be
a
family
aphorism
and
i
was
taught
to
live
up
to
its
best
meaning
the
confederates
were
only
barking
not
biting
as
the
general
said
would
be
the
case
but
they
gave
me
a
genuine
scare
and
i
had
serious
objections
to
traveling
in
texas
unaccompanied
by
a
division
of
cavalry
i
think
the
cold
nights
smoky
tarantulas
that
we
encountered
on
our
march
over
would
have
been
gladly
undertaken
rather
than
run
into
the
face
of
threatening
men
unaccompanied
by
a
single
trooper
as
we
then
traveled
i
wonder
what
the
present
tourist
would
think
of
the
bit
of
railroad
over
which
we
journeyed
from
brennan
to
galveston
i
scarcely
think
it
had
been
touched
in
the
way
of
repairs
during
the
war
the
coaches
were
not
as
good
as
our
present
emigrant
cars
the
rails
were
worn
down
thin
and
so
loosely
secured
that
they
moved
as
we
rolled
slowly
over
them
we
were
to
be
constantly
in
some
sort
of
peril
it
seemed
there
was
a
deep
gully
on
the
route
over
which
was
stretched
a
cobweb
trestle
intended
only
as
a
temporary
bridge
there
was
no
sort
of
question
about
its
insecurity
it
quivered
and
menacingly
swayed
under
us
the
conductor
told
us
that
each
time
he
crossed
he
expected
to
go
down
i
think
he
imagined
there
could
be
no
better
time
than
that
when
it
would
secure
the
effectual
departure
of
a
few
yankee
officers
not
only
from
what
he
considered
his
invaded
state
but
from
the
face
of
the
earth
at
any
rate
he
so
graphically
described
to
me
our
imminent
peril
that
he
put
me
through
all
the
preliminary
stages
of
sudden
death
of
course
our
officers
inured
to
risks
of
all
sorts
took
it
all
as
a
matter
of
course
and
the
general
slyly
called
the
attention
of
our
circle
to
the
usual
manner
in
which
the
old
lady
met
danger
namely
with
her
head
buried
in
the
folds
of
a
cloak
my
husband
knew
what
interest
and
admiration
my
father
bacon
had
for
old
sam
houston
and
he
himself
felt
the
delight
that
one
soldier
takes
in
the
adventures
and
vicissitudes
of
another
consequently
we
had
listened
all
winter
to
the
texans
laudation
of
their
hero
and
many
a
story
that
never
found
its
way
into
print
was
remembered
for
my
father
sake
we
were
only
too
sorry
that
houston
death
two
years
previous
had
prevented
our
personal
acquaintance
he
was
not
as
i
had
supposed
an
ignorant
soldier
of
fortune
but
had
early
scholarly
tastes
and
even
when
a
boy
could
repeat
nearly
all
of
translation
of
the
iliad
though
a
virginian
by
birth
he
early
went
with
his
widowed
mother
to
tennessee
and
his
roving
spirit
led
him
among
the
indians
where
he
lived
for
years
as
the
adopted
son
of
a
chief
he
served
as
an
enlisted
man
under
andrew
jackson
in
the
war
of
and
afterward
became
a
lieutenant
in
the
regular
army
then
he
assumed
the
office
of
indian
agent
and
befriended
those
with
whom
he
had
lived
from
that
he
went
into
law
in
nashville
and
eventually
became
a
congressman
some
marital
difficulties
drove
him
back
to
barbarism
and
he
rejoined
the
cherokees
who
had
been
removed
to
arkansas
he
went
to
washington
to
plead
for
the
tribe
and
returning
left
his
wigwam
among
the
indians
after
a
time
and
went
to
texas
during
the
tumultuous
history
of
that
state
when
it
was
being
shifted
from
one
government
to
another
with
such
vehemence
no
citizen
could
tell
whether
he
would
rise
in
the
morning
a
mexican
or
a
member
of
an
independent
republic
or
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
with
all
that
period
sam
houston
was
identified
he
was
evidently
the
man
for
the
hour
and
it
is
no
wonder
that
our
officers
dwelt
with
delight
upon
his
marvelous
career
in
the
first
revolutionary
movement
of
texas
against
mexican
rule
he
began
to
be
leader
and
was
soon
of
the
texan
army
and
in
the
new
republic
he
was
reëlected
to
that
office
the
dauntless
man
confronted
santa
anna
and
his
force
of
men
with
a
handful
of
texans
all
told
undisciplined
volunteers
ignorant
of
war
but
he
had
that
rare
personal
magnetism
which
is
equal
to
a
reserve
of
armed
battalions
in
giving
men
confidence
and
inciting
them
to
splendid
deeds
out
of
regular
mexican
soldiers
were
killed
and
santa
anna
disguised
as
a
common
soldier
was
captured
then
houston
showed
his
magnanimous
heart
for
after
rebuking
him
for
the
massacres
of
goliad
and
the
alamo
he
protected
him
from
the
vengeance
of
the
enraged
texans
a
treaty
made
with
the
captive
president
resulted
in
the
independence
of
texas
when
after
securing
this
to
the
state
of
his
adoption
houston
was
made
president
of
texas
he
again
showed
his
wonderful
clemency
which
i
can
not
help
believing
was
early
fostered
and
enhanced
by
his
labors
in
behalf
of
the
wronged
cherokees
in
pardoning
santa
anna
and
appointing
his
political
rivals
to
offices
of
trust
if
lincoln
gave
every
energy
to
promoting
the
perpetual
annexation
of
california
by
tethering
that
state
to
our
republic
with
an
iron
lariat
crossing
the
continent
how
quickly
he
would
have
seen
had
he
then
been
in
office
what
infinite
peril
we
were
in
of
losing
that
rich
portion
of
our
country
the
ambition
of
the
soldier
and
conqueror
was
tempered
by
the
most
genuine
patriotism
for
sam
houston
used
his
whole
influence
to
annex
texas
to
the
union
and
the
people
in
gratitude
sent
him
to
washington
as
one
of
their
first
senators
as
president
he
had
overcome
immense
difficulties
carried
on
indian
wars
cleared
off
an
enormous
debt
established
trade
with
mexico
made
successful
indian
treaties
and
steadily
stood
at
the
helm
while
the
state
was
undergoing
all
sorts
of
upheavals
finally
he
was
made
governor
of
the
state
and
opposed
secession
even
resigning
his
office
rather
than
take
the
oath
required
by
the
convention
that
assembled
to
separate
texas
from
the
union
then
poor
old
man
he
died
before
he
was
permitted
to
see
the
promised
land
as
the
war
was
still
in
progress
his
name
is
perpetuated
in
the
town
called
for
him
which
as
the
centre
of
large
railroad
interests
and
as
a
leader
in
the
march
of
improvement
in
that
rapidly
progressing
state
will
be
a
lasting
monument
to
a
great
man
who
did
so
much
to
bring
out
of
chaos
a
vast
extent
of
our
productive
land
sure
to
become
one
of
the
richest
of
the
luxuriant
southern
states
at
galveston
we
were
detained
by
the
of
the
steamer
in
which
we
were
to
go
to
new
orleans
with
a
party
like
ours
it
mattered
little
no
important
interests
were
at
stake
no
business
appointments
awaiting
us
we
strolled
the
town
over
and
commented
as
if
we
owned
it
on
the
insecurity
of
its
foundations
indeed
for
years
after
we
were
surprised
on
taking
up
the
morning
paper
not
to
find
that
galveston
had
dropped
down
into
china
the
spongy
soil
is
so
porous
that
the
water
on
which
rests
the
thin
layer
of
earth
appears
as
soon
as
a
shallow
excavation
is
attempted
of
course
there
are
no
wells
and
the
ungainly
cistern
rises
above
the
roof
at
the
rear
of
the
house
the
hawkers
of
water
through
the
town
amused
us
vastly
especially
as
we
were
not
obliged
to
pay
a
dollar
a
gallon
except
as
it
swelled
our
i
remember
how
we
all
delighted
in
the
oleanders
that
grew
as
whose
white
and
red
blossoms
were
charming
to
the
general
the
best
part
of
all
our
detention
was
the
shell
drive
along
the
ocean
the
island
on
which
galveston
has
its
insecure
footing
is
miles
long
and
the
white
firm
beach
glistening
with
the
pulverized
shells
extending
all
the
distance
was
a
delight
to
us
as
we
spent
hours
out
there
on
the
shore
it
must
surely
have
been
this
white
and
sparkling
thread
bordering
the
island
that
drew
the
ships
of
the
pirate
lafitte
to
moor
in
the
harbor
early
in
the
of
the
oleander
the
blue
of
the
sky
the
luminous
beach
with
the
long
ultramarine
waves
sweeping
in
over
the
shore
were
fascinating
but
on
our
return
to
the
town
all
the
desire
to
remain
was
taken
away
by
the
tale
of
the
citizens
of
the
frequent
rising
of
the
ocean
the
submerging
of
certain
portions
and
the
evidence
they
gave
that
the
earth
beneath
them
was
honeycombed
by
the
action
of
the
water
we
paid
little
heed
at
first
to
the
boat
on
which
we
embarked
it
was
a
captured
built
up
with
two
stories
of
cabins
and
staterooms
for
passengers
in
its
original
condition
the
crew
and
passengers
as
well
as
the
freight
were
down
in
the
hull
the
steamer
was
crowded
our
staterooms
were
tiny
and
though
they
were
on
the
upper
deck
the
odor
of
bilge
water
and
the
untidiness
of
the
boat
made
us
uncomfortable
from
the
first
the
day
was
sunny
and
clear
as
we
departed
and
we
had
hardly
left
the
harbor
before
we
struck
a
norther
such
a
hurricane
as
it
was
at
sea
we
had
thought
ourselves
versed
in
all
the
wind
could
do
on
land
but
a
norther
in
that
maelstrom
of
a
gulf
makes
a
land
storm
mild
in
comparison
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
almost
always
a
tempest
in
a
the
waves
seem
to
lash
themselves
from
shore
to
shore
and
after
speeding
with
tornado
fleetness
toward
the
borders
of
mexico
back
they
rush
to
the
florida
peninsula
no
one
can
be
out
in
one
of
these
tempests
without
wondering
why
that
thin
jet
of
land
which
composes
florida
has
not
long
ago
been
swept
out
of
existence
how
many
of
our
troops
have
suffered
from
the
fury
of
that
ungovernable
gulf
in
the
transit
from
new
orleans
to
matamoras
or
galveston
and
officers
have
spoken
over
and
over
again
of
the
sufferings
of
the
cavalry
horses
condemned
to
the
hold
of
a
government
transport
ships
have
gone
down
there
with
soldiers
and
officers
who
have
encountered
over
and
over
again
the
perils
of
battle
transports
have
only
been
saved
from
being
engulfed
in
those
rapacious
waves
by
unloading
the
ship
of
hundreds
of
horses
and
to
cavalrymen
the
throwing
overboard
of
noble
animals
that
have
been
untiring
in
years
of
campaigning
and
by
their
fleetness
and
pluck
have
saved
the
lives
of
their
masters
is
like
human
sacrifice
officers
and
soldiers
alike
bewail
the
loss
and
for
years
after
speak
of
it
with
sorrow
though
the
wind
seems
to
blow
in
a
circle
much
of
the
time
on
the
gulf
we
found
it
dead
against
us
as
we
proceeded
the
captain
was
a
resolute
man
and
would
not
turn
back
though
the
ship
was
ill
prepared
to
encounter
such
a
gale
we
labored
slowly
though
the
constantly
increasing
tempest
and
the
last
glimpse
of
daylight
lighted
a
sea
that
was
lashed
to
white
foam
about
us
at
home
when
the
sun
sets
the
wind
abates
but
one
must
look
for
an
entire
change
of
programme
where
the
norther
reigns
there
was
no
use
in
remaining
up
so
i
sought
to
forget
my
terror
in
sleep
and
crept
onto
one
of
the
little
shelves
allotted
to
us
the
creaking
and
groaning
of
the
ship
timbers
filled
me
with
alarm
and
i
could
not
help
calling
up
to
my
husband
to
ask
if
it
did
not
seem
to
him
that
all
the
new
portion
of
the
steamer
would
be
swept
off
into
the
sea
though
i
was
comforted
by
assurances
of
its
impossibility
i
wished
with
all
my
heart
we
were
down
in
the
hold
sleep
my
almost
friend
came
to
calm
me
and
i
dreamed
of
the
strange
days
of
the
when
doubtless
other
hearts
were
pounding
against
their
ribs
with
more
alarming
terrors
than
those
that
agitated
me
for
we
well
knew
what
risks
confederate
women
took
to
join
their
husbands
in
the
stormy
days
on
sea
as
well
as
on
land
in
the
night
i
was
awakened
suddenly
by
a
fearful
crash
the
quick
veering
of
the
boat
and
her
violent
rolling
from
side
to
side
at
the
same
instant
the
overturning
of
the
deluged
me
in
my
narrow
berth
my
husband
hearing
my
cry
of
terror
descended
from
his
berth
and
was
beside
me
in
a
moment
no
one
comprehended
what
had
happened
the
crashing
of
timber
and
the
creaking
grinding
sounds
rose
above
the
storm
the
machinery
was
stopped
and
we
plunged
back
and
forth
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
each
time
seeming
to
go
down
deeper
and
deeper
until
there
appeared
to
be
no
doubt
that
the
ship
would
be
eventually
engulfed
there
seemed
to
be
no
question
as
the
breaking
of
massive
beams
went
on
that
we
were
going
to
pieces
the
ship
made
a
brave
fight
with
the
elements
and
seemed
to
writhe
and
struggle
like
something
human
in
the
midst
of
this
the
shouts
of
the
sailors
the
trumpet
of
the
captain
giving
orders
went
on
and
was
followed
by
the
creaking
of
chains
the
strain
of
the
cordage
and
the
mad
thrashing
to
and
fro
of
the
canvas
which
we
supposed
had
been
torn
from
the
spars
instant
disorder
took
possession
of
the
cabin
everything
movable
was
in
motion
the
trunks
which
the
crowded
condition
of
the
hold
had
compelled
us
to
put
in
the
upper
end
of
the
cabin
slid
down
the
carpet
banging
from
side
to
side
the
furniture
broke
from
its
fastenings
and
slipped
to
and
fro
the
smashing
of
lamps
in
our
cabin
was
followed
by
the
crash
of
crockery
in
the
adjoining
while
above
all
these
sounds
rose
the
cries
and
wails
of
the
women
some
kneeling
in
their
prayed
loudly
while
others
sank
in
heaps
on
the
floor
moaning
and
weeping
in
their
helpless
condition
the
calls
of
frantic
women
asking
for
some
one
to
go
and
find
if
we
were
going
down
were
unanswered
by
the
terrified
men
meanwhile
my
husband
having
implored
me
to
remain
in
one
spot
and
not
attempt
to
follow
him
hastily
threw
on
his
clothes
and
left
me
begging
that
i
would
remember
while
he
was
absent
that
the
captain
wife
and
child
were
with
us
and
if
a
man
ever
was
nerved
to
do
his
best
that
brave
husband
and
father
would
do
so
it
seemed
an
eternity
to
wait
i
was
obliged
to
cling
to
the
door
to
be
kept
from
being
dashed
across
the
cabin
while
i
wept
and
shivered
and
endured
double
agony
knowing
into
what
peril
my
husband
had
by
that
time
struggled
i
felt
warm
soft
arms
about
me
and
our
faithful
eliza
was
crooning
over
me
begging
me
to
be
comforted
that
she
was
there
holding
me
awakened
at
the
end
of
the
cabin
where
she
slept
on
a
sofa
she
thought
of
nothing
but
making
her
way
through
the
demolished
furniture
to
take
me
in
her
protecting
arms
every
one
who
knows
the
negro
character
is
aware
what
their
terrors
are
at
sea
how
then
can
i
recall
the
noble
forgetfulness
of
self
of
that
faithful
soul
without
tears
of
gratitude
as
fresh
as
those
that
flowed
on
her
tender
breast
when
she
held
me
there
was
not
a
vestige
of
the
heroic
about
me
i
simply
cowered
in
a
corner
and
let
eliza
shelter
me
besides
i
felt
that
i
had
a
kind
of
right
to
yield
to
selfish
fright
for
it
was
my
husband
of
all
the
men
on
shipboard
who
had
climbed
laboriously
to
the
deck
to
do
what
he
could
for
our
safety
and
calm
the
agitated
women
below
some
of
the
noble
southern
women
proved
how
deep
was
their
natural
goodness
of
heart
for
the
very
ones
who
had
coldly
looked
me
over
and
shrunk
from
a
hated
yankee
when
we
met
the
day
before
crept
slowly
up
to
calm
my
terrors
about
my
husband
and
instruct
eliza
what
to
do
for
me
at
last
and
oh
how
interminable
the
time
had
seemed
the
general
opened
the
cabin
door
and
struggled
along
to
the
weeping
women
they
all
plied
him
with
questions
and
he
was
able
to
calm
them
so
the
wailing
and
praying
subsided
somewhat
when
he
climbed
up
the
companionway
the
waves
were
dashing
over
the
entire
deck
and
he
was
compelled
to
creep
on
his
hands
and
knees
clinging
to
ropes
and
spars
as
best
he
could
till
he
reached
the
only
his
superb
strength
kept
him
from
being
swept
overboard
every
inch
of
his
progress
was
a
deadly
peril
he
found
the
calm
captain
willing
to
explain
and
paid
the
tribute
that
one
brave
man
gives
another
in
moments
of
peril
the
norther
had
broken
in
the
and
disabled
the
machinery
so
that
but
for
the
sails
which
we
who
were
below
had
heard
raised
we
must
have
drifted
and
tossed
to
shipwreck
if
he
could
make
any
progress
we
were
comparatively
safe
but
with
such
a
hurricane
all
was
uncertain
this
part
of
the
captain
statement
the
general
suppressed
we
women
were
told
after
the
fashion
of
men
who
desire
to
comfort
and
calm
our
sex
only
a
portion
of
the
truth
the
motion
of
the
boat
as
it
rolled
from
side
to
side
made
every
one
succumb
except
eliza
and
me
the
general
completely
subdued
and
intensely
wretched
physically
crept
into
his
berth
and
though
he
was
so
miserable
i
remember
toward
morning
a
faint
thrust
of
ridicule
at
our
adjoining
neighbors
the
greenes
who
were
suffering
also
the
tortures
of
seasickness
a
sarcastic
query
as
to
the
stability
of
their
stomachs
called
forth
a
retort
that
he
had
better
look
to
his
own
eliza
held
me
untiringly
and
though
the
terror
of
uncertainty
had
subsided
somewhat
i
could
not
get
on
without
an
assurance
of
our
safety
from
that
upper
berth
my
husband
in
his
helplessness
and
abandoned
as
he
was
to
physical
misery
could
scarcely
turn
to
speak
more
than
a
word
or
two
at
a
time
and
even
then
eliza
would
tell
him
ginnel
you
jest
to
your
own
self
and
i
to
miss
libbie
it
is
difficult
to
explain
what
a
shock
it
is
to
find
one
who
never
succumbs
entirely
subjugated
by
suffering
all
support
seems
to
be
removed
in
all
our
vicissitudes
i
had
never
before
seen
the
general
go
under
for
an
instant
he
replied
that
he
was
intensely
sorry
for
me
but
such
deadly
nausea
made
him
indifferent
to
life
and
for
his
part
he
cared
not
whether
he
went
up
or
down
so
the
long
night
wore
on
i
thought
no
dawn
ever
seemed
so
grateful
the
waves
were
mountains
high
and
we
still
plunged
into
what
appeared
to
be
solid
banks
of
green
glittering
crystal
only
to
drop
down
into
seemingly
hopeless
gulfs
but
daylight
diminishes
all
terrors
and
there
was
hope
with
the
coming
of
light
a
few
crept
out
and
some
even
took
courage
for
breakfast
the
feeble
notes
disappeared
from
my
voice
and
he
began
to
cheer
me
up
then
he
crept
to
our
witty
greene
the
dear
nettie
of
our
home
days
to
send
more
sly
thrusts
in
her
stateroom
regarding
his
opinion
of
one
who
yielded
to
seasickness
so
she
was
badgered
into
making
an
appearance
while
all
were
contributing
experiences
of
the
awful
night
and
commenting
on
their
terrors
we
were
amazed
to
see
the
door
of
a
stateroom
open
and
a
german
family
walk
out
unconcernedly
from
what
we
all
night
supposed
was
an
unoccupied
room
the
parents
and
three
children
showed
and
wonder
when
they
heard
of
the
night
through
all
the
din
and
danger
they
had
peacefully
slept
and
doubtless
would
have
gone
down
had
we
been
shipwrecked
unconscious
in
their
lethargy
that
death
had
come
to
them
then
the
white
exhausted
faces
of
our
officers
who
had
slept
in
the
other
cabin
began
to
appear
our
father
custer
came
tottering
in
and
made
his
son
shout
out
with
merriment
even
in
the
midst
of
all
the
wretched
surroundings
when
he
laconically
said
to
his
boy
that
next
time
i
follow
you
to
texas
it
will
be
when
this
pond
is
bridged
over
two
of
the
officers
had
a
stateroom
next
the
and
begged
the
general
to
bring
me
up
there
my
husband
feeling
so
deeply
the
terrible
night
of
terror
and
entire
wakefulness
for
me
picked
me
up
and
carried
me
to
the
upper
deck
where
i
was
laid
in
the
berth
and
restored
to
some
sort
of
calm
by
an
opportune
glass
of
champagne
the
wine
seemed
to
do
my
husband
as
much
good
as
it
did
me
though
he
did
not
taste
it
all
vestige
of
his
prostration
of
the
preceding
night
disappeared
and
no
one
escaped
his
comical
recapitulation
of
how
they
conducted
themselves
when
we
were
threatened
with
such
peril
my
terrors
of
the
sea
were
too
to
be
set
aside
and
even
after
we
had
left
the
hated
gulf
and
were
safely
moving
up
the
mississippi
to
new
orleans
i
felt
no
security
nothing
but
the
actual
planting
of
our
feet
on
restored
my
equanimity
among
the
petitions
of
the
litany
asking
our
heavenly
father
to
protect
us
none
since
that
gulf
storm
has
ever
been
emphasized
to
me
as
the
prayer
for
preservation
from
perils
by
land
and
by
sea
new
orleans
was
again
a
pleasure
to
us
and
this
time
we
knew
just
where
to
go
for
recreation
or
for
our
dinner
nearly
a
year
in
texas
had
prepared
us
for
gastronomic
feats
and
though
the
general
was
by
no
means
a
any
one
so
susceptible
to
surroundings
as
he
would
be
tempted
by
the
dainty
serving
of
a
french
dinner
our
party
had
dined
too
often
with
duke
humphrey
in
the
pine
forests
of
louisiana
and
texas
not
to
enjoy
every
delicacy
served
all
through
the
year
it
had
been
the
custom
to
refer
to
the
luxuries
of
the
french
market
and
now
with
our
purses
a
little
fuller
than
when
we
were
on
our
way
into
texas
we
had
some
royal
times
that
is
for
poor
folks
we
took
a
steamer
for
cairo
and
though
the
novelty
of
river
travel
was
over
it
continued
to
be
most
enjoyable
and
still
the
staff
found
the
an
event
as
they
were
making
up
for
our
limited
bill
of
fare
the
year
past
a
very
good
string
band
charmed
the
savage
while
he
dined
it
was
the
custom
now
obsolete
to
march
the
white
coated
and
aproned
waiters
in
file
from
kitchen
to
each
carrying
aloft
some
feat
of
the
cook
and
as
we
had
a
table
to
ourselves
there
was
no
lack
of
witty
comments
on
this
military
serving
of
our
food
and
smacking
of
lips
over
edibles
we
had
almost
forgotten
in
our
year
of
the
negroes
were
in
a
state
of
perpetual
guffaws
over
the
remarks
made
by
our
merry
table
and
they
soon
grew
to
be
skillful
confederates
in
all
the
pranks
practiced
on
our
father
custer
for
instance
he
slowly
read
over
the
bill
of
fare
or
his
sons
read
it
and
he
chose
the
viands
as
they
were
repeated
to
him
broiled
ham
on
coals
seemed
to
attract
his
taste
then
my
husband
said
of
course
of
course
what
a
good
selection
and
gave
the
order
accompanied
by
a
significant
wink
to
the
waiter
presently
our
parent
feeling
an
unnatural
warmth
near
his
ear
looked
around
to
find
his
order
filled
literally
and
the
ham
sizzling
on
red
coals
he
naturally
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
the
dish
fearing
to
set
the
boat
on
fire
and
his
sons
were
preternaturally
absorbed
in
talking
with
some
one
at
the
end
of
the
table
while
the
waiter
slid
back
to
the
kitchen
to
have
his
laugh
out
our
father
custer
was
of
the
most
intensely
argumentative
nature
he
was
the
strongest
sort
of
politician
he
is
now
and
grows
excited
and
belligerent
over
his
party
affairs
at
nearly
eighty
as
if
he
were
a
lad
he
is
beloved
at
home
in
monroe
but
it
is
considered
too
good
fun
not
to
fling
little
sneers
at
his
candidate
or
party
just
to
witness
the
rapidity
with
which
the
old
gentleman
plunges
into
a
defense
michigan
present
secretary
of
state
the
hon
harry
conant
my
husband
and
now
my
father
faithful
friend
early
took
his
cue
from
the
general
and
loses
no
opportunity
now
to
get
up
a
wordy
war
with
our
venerable
democrat
solely
to
hear
the
defense
and
then
too
our
father
custer
considers
it
time
well
spent
to
labor
with
that
young
man
over
the
error
he
considers
he
has
made
in
the
choice
of
politics
as
the
old
gentleman
drives
or
rides
his
son
dandy
through
the
town
his
progress
is
slow
for
some
voice
is
certain
to
be
raised
from
the
sidewalk
calling
out
well
father
custer
paper
shows
your
side
well
whipped
or
a
like
challenge
to
argument
dandy
is
drawn
up
at
once
and
the
flies
can
nip
his
sides
at
will
so
far
as
his
usually
careful
master
is
conscious
of
him
as
he
can
not
proceed
until
the
one
who
has
agitated
him
has
been
struggled
over
to
convince
him
of
the
error
of
his
belief
i
was
driving
with
him
in
monroe
not
long
since
and
as
the
train
was
passing
through
the
town
dandy
was
driven
up
to
the
cars
i
expostulated
asking
if
he
intended
him
to
climb
over
or
creep
under
but
he
persisted
only
explaining
that
he
wished
me
to
see
how
gentle
dandy
could
be
suddenly
the
conductor
swung
himself
from
the
platform
and
called
out
some
bantering
words
about
politics
our
father
was
then
for
driving
dandy
directly
into
the
train
he
fairly
yelled
some
sort
of
imputation
upon
the
other
party
and
then
kept
on
talking
gesticulating
with
his
whip
and
shaking
it
at
the
conductor
who
laughed
immoderately
as
he
was
being
carried
out
of
sight
i
asked
what
was
the
matter
did
he
have
any
grudge
or
hatred
for
the
man
oh
no
daughter
he
a
good
enough
fellow
only
he
an
onery
scamp
of
a
republican
his
sons
never
lost
a
chance
to
enter
into
discussion
with
him
i
have
known
the
general
to
bone
up
as
his
west
point
phrase
expressed
it
on
the
smallest
details
of
some
question
at
issue
in
the
republican
party
for
no
other
reason
than
to
incite
his
parent
to
a
defense
the
discussion
was
so
earnest
that
even
i
would
be
deceived
into
thinking
it
something
my
husband
was
all
on
fire
about
but
the
older
man
was
never
rasped
or
badgered
into
anger
he
worked
and
struggled
with
his
boy
and
mourned
that
he
should
have
a
son
who
had
so
far
strayed
from
the
truth
as
he
understood
it
the
general
argued
as
vehemently
as
his
father
and
never
undeceived
him
for
days
but
simply
let
the
old
gentleman
think
how
misguided
he
really
was
it
served
to
pass
many
an
hour
of
slow
travel
up
the
river
tom
connived
with
the
general
to
deprive
their
father
temporarily
of
his
dinner
when
the
plate
was
well
prepared
as
was
the
custom
the
potato
and
vegetables
seasoned
the
meat
cut
it
was
the
signal
for
my
husband
to
hurl
a
bomb
of
inflammable
information
at
the
whitening
hairs
of
his
parent
the
old
man
would
rather
argue
than
eat
and
laying
down
his
knife
and
fork
he
fell
to
the
discussion
as
eagerly
as
if
he
had
not
been
hungry
as
the
argument
grew
energetic
and
more
absorbing
tom
slipped
away
the
father
plate
ate
all
the
nicely
prepared
food
and
returned
it
empty
to
its
place
then
the
general
tapered
off
his
aggravating
threats
and
said
well
come
come
come
father
why
do
you
eat
your
dinner
father
custer
blank
face
at
the
sight
of
the
empty
plate
was
a
sight
to
his
offspring
and
they
took
good
care
to
tip
the
waiter
and
order
a
warm
dinner
for
the
still
arguing
man
in
a
quaint
letter
a
portion
of
which
i
give
below
father
custer
tells
how
early
in
life
he
began
to
teach
his
boys
politics
tecumseh
my
dear
daughter
elizabeth
i
received
your
letter
requesting
me
to
tell
you
something
of
our
trip
up
the
mississippi
with
my
dear
boys
autie
and
tommy
well
as
i
was
always
a
boy
with
my
boys
i
will
try
and
tell
you
of
some
of
our
jokes
and
tricks
on
each
other
i
want
to
tell
you
also
of
a
little
incident
when
autie
was
about
four
years
old
he
had
to
have
a
tooth
drawn
and
he
was
very
much
afraid
of
blood
when
i
took
him
to
the
doctor
to
have
the
tooth
pulled
it
was
in
the
night
and
i
told
him
if
it
bled
well
it
would
get
well
right
away
and
he
must
be
a
good
soldier
when
he
got
to
the
doctor
he
took
his
seat
and
the
pulling
began
the
forceps
slipped
off
and
he
had
to
make
a
second
trial
he
pulled
it
out
and
autie
never
even
scrunched
going
home
i
led
him
by
the
arm
he
jumped
and
skipped
and
said
you
and
me
can
whip
all
the
whigs
in
michigan
i
thought
that
was
saying
a
good
deal
but
i
did
not
contradict
him
when
we
were
in
texas
i
was
at
autie
headquarters
one
day
and
something
came
up
i
forgotten
what
it
was
but
i
said
i
would
bet
that
it
was
not
so
and
he
said
will
you
bet
i
said
bet
my
trunk
i
have
forgotten
the
amount
he
put
up
against
it
but
according
to
the
rule
of
betting
he
won
my
trunk
i
thought
that
was
the
end
of
it
as
i
took
it
just
as
a
joke
and
i
remained
there
with
him
for
some
time
to
my
great
astonishment
here
came
an
orderly
with
the
trunk
on
his
shoulder
and
set
it
down
before
autie
well
i
hardly
knew
what
to
think
i
been
there
long
and
did
know
camp
ways
very
well
i
had
always
understood
that
the
soldiers
were
a
pretty
rough
set
of
customers
and
i
wanted
to
know
how
to
try
and
take
care
of
myself
so
i
thought
i
would
go
up
to
my
tent
and
see
what
had
become
of
my
goods
and
chattels
when
i
got
there
all
my
things
were
on
my
bed
tom
had
taken
them
out
and
he
had
not
been
very
particular
in
getting
them
out
so
they
were
scattered
for
i
suppose
he
was
hurried
and
thought
i
would
catch
him
at
it
i
began
to
think
that
i
would
have
to
hunt
quarters
in
some
other
direction
the
next
trick
autie
played
me
was
on
account
of
his
knowing
that
i
was
very
anxious
to
see
an
alligator
he
was
out
with
his
gun
one
day
and
i
heard
him
shoot
and
when
he
came
up
to
his
tent
i
asked
him
what
he
had
been
firing
at
he
said
an
alligator
so
i
started
off
to
see
the
animal
and
when
i
found
it
what
do
you
think
it
was
but
an
old
government
mule
that
had
died
because
it
was
played
out
well
he
had
a
hearty
laugh
over
that
trick
then
my
daughter
i
was
going
over
my
mess
bill
and
some
of
my
accounts
with
tommy
and
to
my
great
astonishment
i
found
i
was
out
a
hundred
dollars
i
could
not
see
how
i
could
have
made
such
a
mistake
but
i
just
kept
this
to
myself
i
did
say
a
word
about
it
until
autie
and
tom
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
so
autie
asked
me
one
day
about
my
money
matters
i
told
him
i
was
out
a
hundred
dollars
and
i
could
not
understand
it
then
he
just
told
me
that
tommy
had
hooked
that
sum
from
me
while
he
was
pretending
to
help
me
straighten
up
i
went
for
tom
and
got
my
stolen
money
back
the
next
outrage
on
me
was
about
the
mess
bill
there
was
you
libbie
autie
tom
colonel
and
greene
major
and
lyon
and
we
divided
up
the
amount
spent
each
month
and
all
took
turns
running
the
mess
somehow
or
other
my
bill
was
pretty
big
when
autie
and
tom
had
the
mess
i
just
rebelled
against
such
extravagance
and
rather
than
suffer
myself
to
be
robbed
i
threatened
to
go
and
mess
with
the
or
some
other
honest
soldier
who
would
cheat
an
old
man
that
tickled
the
boys
it
was
just
what
they
were
aiming
at
i
would
pay
so
what
do
you
think
tommy
did
but
borrow
the
amount
of
me
to
buy
supplies
and
when
settling
time
came
for
mess
bills
they
said
we
came
out
about
even
in
money
matters
and
so
they
were
all
the
time
playing
tricks
on
me
and
it
pleased
them
so
much
to
get
off
a
good
joke
besides
they
knew
i
was
just
as
good
a
boy
with
them
as
they
were
your
affectionate
father
h
custer
chapter
x
general
custer
parts
with
his
staff
at
cairo
and
detroit
all
the
smaller
schemes
to
tease
our
father
custer
gave
way
to
a
grand
one
concocted
in
the
busy
brains
of
his
boys
to
rob
their
parent
while
the
patriarch
sat
in
the
cabin
reading
aloud
to
himself
as
is
still
his
custom
what
he
considered
the
editorial
columns
of
a
favorite
paper
his
progeny
were
in
some
sheltered
corner
of
the
guards
plotting
the
discomfiture
of
their
father
the
plans
were
well
laid
but
the
general
was
obliged
to
give
as
much
time
to
it
in
a
way
as
when
projecting
a
raid
for
he
knew
he
had
to
encounter
a
wily
foe
who
was
always
on
guard
the
father
early
in
their
childhood
playing
all
sorts
of
tricks
on
his
boys
was
on
the
alert
whenever
he
was
with
them
to
parry
a
return
thrust
i
believe
several
attempts
had
been
made
to
take
the
old
gentleman
money
but
he
was
too
wary
they
knew
that
he
had
sewed
some
bills
in
his
waistcoat
and
that
his
steamer
ticket
and
other
money
were
in
his
purse
these
he
carefully
placed
under
his
pillow
at
night
he
continues
in
his
letter
tommy
and
i
had
a
stateroom
together
and
on
one
night
in
particular
all
the
folks
had
gone
to
bed
in
the
cabin
and
tom
was
hurrying
me
to
go
to
bed
i
was
not
sleepy
and
did
not
want
to
turn
in
but
he
hung
round
so
that
at
last
i
did
go
to
our
stateroom
he
took
the
upper
berth
i
put
my
vest
under
the
pillow
and
was
pulling
off
my
boots
when
i
felt
sure
i
saw
something
going
out
over
the
transom
i
looked
under
the
pillow
and
my
vest
was
gone
then
i
waked
tommy
who
was
snoring
already
i
told
him
both
my
purse
and
vest
were
gone
and
as
the
saying
is
i
the
rat
i
opened
the
door
and
felt
sure
that
autie
had
arranged
to
snatch
the
vest
and
purse
when
it
was
thrown
out
i
ran
out
in
the
cabin
to
his
stateroom
but
he
had
the
start
of
me
and
was
locked
in
i
did
not
know
for
sure
which
was
his
room
so
i
hit
and
i
thundered
at
his
door
the
people
stuck
their
heads
out
of
their
staterooms
and
over
the
transom
came
a
glass
of
water
so
i
being
rather
wet
concluded
i
would
give
it
up
till
the
next
morning
and
what
do
you
think
those
scamps
did
tom
though
i
gave
it
to
him
well
would
own
up
to
a
thing
and
just
said
was
too
bad
such
robberies
went
on
in
a
ship
like
that
he
was
very
sorry
for
me
and
alluded
to
the
fact
that
the
door
being
unlocked
was
proof
that
the
thief
had
a
skeleton
key
and
all
that
nonsense
next
morning
autie
met
me
and
asked
what
on
earth
i
had
been
about
the
night
before
such
a
fracas
all
the
people
had
come
out
to
look
up
the
matter
and
there
i
was
pounding
at
a
young
lady
door
a
friend
of
libbie
and
a
girl
i
liked
indeed
i
had
taken
quite
a
shine
to
her
they
made
out
those
shameless
rogues
and
very
solemn
autie
was
about
it
too
that
it
was
not
a
very
fine
thing
for
my
reputation
to
be
pounding
on
a
young
lady
door
late
at
night
frightening
her
half
to
death
and
obliging
her
to
defend
herself
with
a
pitcher
of
water
she
thought
i
had
been
trying
to
break
in
her
door
and
i
had
better
go
to
her
at
once
and
apologize
as
the
whole
party
were
being
compromised
by
such
scandal
they
failed
there
for
i
knew
i
was
not
at
her
door
and
i
knew
who
it
was
that
threw
the
water
on
me
i
was
bound
to
try
and
get
even
with
them
so
one
morning
while
they
were
all
at
breakfast
i
went
to
autie
stateroom
eliza
was
making
up
the
bed
i
looked
for
autie
and
found
it
under
the
pillow
i
kept
out
of
the
way
and
did
not
come
near
them
for
some
days
but
they
got
desperate
and
were
determined
to
beat
me
so
they
made
it
up
that
tommy
was
to
get
round
me
seize
me
by
my
arms
at
the
back
and
autie
go
through
my
pockets
well
they
left
me
without
a
dime
and
i
had
to
travel
without
paying
and
those
outlaws
of
boys
got
the
clerk
to
come
to
me
and
demand
my
ticket
i
told
him
i
had
none
that
i
had
been
robbed
he
said
he
was
sorry
but
i
would
have
to
pay
over
again
as
some
one
who
stole
the
ticket
would
be
likely
to
use
it
i
tried
to
tell
him
i
would
make
it
right
before
i
left
the
boat
but
i
had
a
penny
then
well
daughter
i
came
out
best
at
the
last
for
autie
having
really
all
the
money
though
he
would
own
up
to
it
had
all
the
bills
to
pay
and
when
i
got
home
i
was
so
much
the
gainer
for
it
did
not
cost
me
anything
from
the
time
i
left
the
boat
either
till
we
got
home
and
then
autie
gave
me
up
my
with
all
the
money
and
we
all
had
a
good
laugh
while
the
boys
told
their
mother
of
the
pranks
they
had
played
on
me
illustration
stand
there
cowards
will
you
and
see
an
old
man
robbed
my
father
story
ceases
without
doing
justice
to
himself
for
the
cunning
manner
in
which
he
circumvented
those
mischievous
fellows
i
remember
and
it
seems
my
husband
had
given
a
full
account
to
our
friend
the
hon
harry
conant
he
writes
to
me
what
is
very
true
that
it
seems
one
must
know
the
quaint
and
brave
old
man
to
appreciate
how
exquisitely
funny
the
incident
as
told
by
the
general
really
was
the
third
day
after
the
robbery
the
general
and
tom
thinking
their
father
engaged
at
a
remote
part
of
the
boat
while
talking
over
their
escapade
incautiously
exhibited
the
suddenly
the
hand
that
held
it
was
seized
in
the
strong
grasp
of
the
wronged
father
who
lustily
calling
for
aid
assured
the
passengers
that
were
thronging
up
and
being
strangers
knew
nothing
of
the
relationship
of
the
parties
that
this
purse
was
his
and
that
he
had
been
robbed
by
these
two
scoundrels
and
if
they
would
assist
in
securing
their
arrest
and
restoring
the
purse
he
would
prove
all
he
said
seeing
the
crowd
hesitate
he
called
out
shame
stand
there
cowards
will
you
and
see
an
old
man
robbed
it
was
enough
the
spectators
rushed
in
and
the
general
was
outwitted
by
his
artful
parent
and
obliged
to
explain
the
situation
but
the
consequent
restoration
of
his
property
did
not
give
him
half
the
satisfaction
that
it
did
to
turn
the
tables
on
the
boys
though
they
never
acknowledged
this
robbery
to
their
father
none
were
so
proud
of
his
victory
as
tom
and
the
general
i
must
not
leave
to
the
imagination
of
the
people
who
may
chance
to
read
the
suspicion
that
my
husband
and
tom
ever
made
their
father
in
the
least
unhappy
by
their
incessant
joking
he
met
them
always
and
i
never
knew
them
lack
in
reverence
for
his
snowy
head
he
was
wont
to
speak
of
his
texas
life
with
his
sons
as
his
happiest
year
for
many
preceding
and
used
to
say
that
were
it
not
for
our
mother
constantly
increasing
feebleness
he
would
go
out
to
them
in
kansas
when
he
reached
his
own
ground
he
made
tom
and
the
general
pay
for
some
of
their
plots
and
plans
to
render
him
uncomfortable
by
coming
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
roaring
out
and
he
had
a
stentorian
voice
that
they
had
better
be
getting
up
as
it
was
late
father
custer
thought
was
late
his
sons
differed
as
soon
as
they
found
the
clamor
was
to
continue
assisted
by
the
dogs
which
he
had
released
from
the
stable
leaping
and
springing
on
our
beds
in
excitement
they
went
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
shouted
out
for
everything
that
the
traveler
calls
for
in
a
hotel
hot
water
cocktail
barber
morning
paper
and
none
of
these
being
forthcoming
in
the
simple
home
they
vociferated
in
what
the
outsider
might
have
thought
angry
voices
what
sort
of
hotel
do
you
keep
any
way
father
custer
had
an
answer
for
every
question
and
only
by
talking
so
fast
and
loud
that
they
talked
him
down
did
they
get
the
better
of
him
our
mother
custer
almost
invariably
sided
with
her
boys
it
made
no
sort
of
difference
if
father
custer
stood
alone
he
never
seemed
to
expect
a
champion
he
did
seem
to
think
that
she
was
carrying
her
views
to
an
advanced
point
when
she
endeavored
to
decline
a
new
cur
that
he
had
introduced
into
the
house
on
the
strength
of
its
having
no
pedigree
her
sons
talked
dog
to
her
so
much
that
one
would
be
very
apt
to
be
educated
up
to
the
demand
for
an
authenticated
grandfather
besides
the
towsers
and
rovers
and
all
that
sort
of
mongrels
to
which
she
had
patiently
submitted
in
all
the
childhood
of
her
boys
and
their
boyish
father
entitled
her
to
some
choice
in
after
years
at
cairo
our
partings
began
for
there
some
of
the
staff
left
us
for
their
homes
we
dreaded
to
give
them
up
our
harmonious
life
and
the
friendships
welded
by
the
sharing
of
hardships
and
dangers
made
us
feel
that
it
would
be
well
if
having
tested
one
another
we
might
go
on
in
our
future
together
at
detroit
the
rest
of
our
military
family
disbanded
how
the
general
regretted
them
the
men
scarce
more
than
boys
even
then
had
responded
to
every
call
to
charge
in
his
michigan
brigade
and
afterward
in
the
third
cavalry
division
some
wounded
almost
to
death
had
been
carried
from
his
side
on
the
as
he
feared
forever
and
had
returned
with
wounds
still
unhealed
one
of
those
valiant
men
has
just
died
suffering
all
these
years
from
his
wound
but
in
writing
speaking
in
public
when
he
could
talking
to
those
who
surrounded
him
when
he
was
too
weak
to
do
more
one
name
ran
through
his
whole
anguished
life
one
hero
hallowed
his
days
and
that
was
his
still
another
of
our
military
family
invalided
by
his
eleven
months
confinement
in
libby
prison
set
his
wan
white
face
toward
the
uncertain
future
before
him
and
began
his
his
soul
undaunted
by
his
disabled
body
another
oh
what
a
brave
boy
he
was
took
my
husband
proffered
aid
and
received
an
appointment
in
the
regular
army
he
carried
always
does
now
a
shattered
arm
torn
by
a
bullet
while
he
was
riding
beside
general
custer
in
virginia
that
did
not
keep
him
from
giving
his
splendid
energy
his
best
and
truest
patriotism
to
his
country
down
in
texas
even
after
the
war
for
he
rode
on
long
exhausting
campaigns
after
the
indians
his
wound
bleeding
his
life
sapped
his
vitality
slipping
away
with
the
pain
that
never
left
him
day
or
night
that
summer
when
we
were
at
home
in
monroe
the
general
sent
for
him
to
come
to
us
and
get
his
share
of
the
pretty
girls
that
tom
and
the
michigan
staff
who
lived
near
us
were
appropriating
the
handsome
fellow
carried
off
the
favors
for
though
the
others
had
been
wounded
tom
even
then
bearing
the
scarlet
spot
on
his
cheek
where
the
bullet
had
penetrated
the
last
comer
won
for
he
still
wore
his
arm
in
a
sling
the
bewitching
girls
had
before
them
the
evidence
of
his
valor
and
into
what
a
garden
he
stepped
he
was
a
modest
fellow
and
would
not
demand
too
much
pity
but
made
light
of
his
wound
as
is
the
custom
of
soldiers
who
dreading
effeminacy
carry
the
matter
too
far
and
ignore
what
ought
not
to
be
looked
upon
slightingly
one
day
he
appeared
without
his
sling
and
a
careless
girl
dancing
with
him
grasped
the
arm
in
the
forgetfulness
of
glee
the
waves
of
torture
that
swept
over
the
young
hero
face
the
alarm
and
pity
of
the
girl
the
instant
biting
of
the
lip
and
quick
smile
of
the
man
dreading
more
to
grieve
the
pretty
creature
by
him
than
to
endure
the
physical
agony
oh
how
proud
the
general
was
of
him
and
i
think
he
felt
badly
that
a
soldier
can
not
yield
to
impulse
and
enfold
his
comrade
in
his
arms
as
is
our
woman
sweet
privilege
with
one
another
proudly
the
general
followed
the
career
of
those
young
fellows
who
had
been
so
near
him
in
his
of
all
those
in
whom
he
continued
always
to
retain
an
interest
keeping
up
in
some
instances
a
desultory
correspondence
the
most
amazing
evolution
was
that
of
the
into
a
methodist
minister
whether
he
was
at
heart
a
stern
unrelenting
character
is
a
question
i
doubted
for
he
never
could
have
developed
into
a
clergyman
but
he
had
the
strangest
most
implacable
face
when
sent
on
his
thankless
duty
by
his
commanding
officer
he
it
was
who
conducted
the
ceremonies
that
one
awful
day
in
louisiana
when
the
execution
and
pardon
took
place
i
remember
the
general
amazement
when
he
received
the
letter
in
which
the
announcement
of
the
new
was
made
it
took
us
both
some
time
to
realize
how
he
would
set
about
evangelizing
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
him
leading
any
one
to
the
throne
of
grace
except
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
with
a
military
band
playing
the
dead
march
in
saul
i
know
how
pleased
my
husband
was
though
how
proud
and
glad
to
know
that
a
splendid
brave
soldier
had
given
his
talents
his
courage
and
oh
what
courage
for
a
man
of
the
world
to
come
out
in
youth
on
the
side
of
one
mighty
captain
and
taken
up
the
life
of
poverty
and
something
else
that
the
general
also
felt
a
deprivation
the
roving
life
that
deprives
a
methodist
minister
of
the
blessings
of
a
permanent
home
the
delightful
letters
we
used
to
get
from
our
military
family
when
any
epoch
occurred
in
their
lives
like
the
choice
of
a
profession
or
business
for
most
of
them
went
back
to
civil
life
their
marriage
the
birth
of
a
son
all
gave
my
husband
genuine
pleasure
and
when
their
sorrows
came
he
turned
to
me
to
write
the
letter
a
which
was
his
in
all
but
the
manipulation
of
the
pen
his
personal
influence
he
gave
time
and
time
again
when
it
was
needed
in
their
lives
and
best
of
all
in
my
eyes
had
patience
with
those
who
had
a
larger
sowing
of
the
crop
which
is
the
agricultural
feature
in
the
early
life
of
most
men
since
i
seek
to
make
my
story
of
others
i
take
the
privilege
of
speaking
of
a
class
of
heroes
that
i
now
seldom
hear
mentioned
and
over
whom
in
instances
of
my
husband
personal
friends
we
have
grieved
together
it
is
to
those
who
like
his
young
bear
unhealed
and
painful
wounds
to
their
life
end
that
i
wish
to
beg
our
people
to
give
thought
we
felt
it
rather
a
blessing
in
one
way
when
a
man
was
visibly
maimed
for
if
a
leg
or
an
arm
is
gone
the
empty
sleeve
or
the
halting
gait
keeps
his
country
from
forgetting
that
he
has
braved
everything
to
protect
her
the
men
we
sorrowed
for
were
those
who
suffered
silently
and
there
are
more
north
and
south
than
anyone
dreams
of
scattered
all
over
our
now
fair
and
prosperous
land
sometimes
after
they
die
it
transpires
that
at
the
approach
of
every
storm
they
have
been
obliged
to
stop
work
enter
into
the
seclusion
of
their
rooms
and
endure
the
racking
torturing
pain
that
began
on
the
so
long
ago
if
anyone
finds
this
out
in
their
lifetime
it
is
usually
by
accident
and
when
asked
why
they
suffer
without
claiming
the
sympathy
that
does
help
us
all
they
sometimes
reply
that
the
war
is
too
far
back
to
tax
anyone
memory
or
sympathy
now
oftener
they
attempt
to
ignore
what
they
endure
and
change
the
subject
instantly
people
would
be
surprised
to
know
how
many
in
the
community
whom
they
daily
touch
in
the
jostle
of
life
are
silent
sufferers
from
wounds
or
incurable
disease
contracted
during
the
war
for
the
union
the
monuments
tablets
memorials
which
are
strewn
with
flowers
and
bathed
with
grateful
tears
have
often
tribute
that
should
be
partly
given
to
the
double
hero
who
bears
on
his
bruised
and
broken
body
the
torture
of
daily
sacrifice
for
his
country
people
even
if
they
know
forget
the
look
the
word
of
acknowledgment
that
is
due
the
maimed
patriot
i
recall
the
chagrin
i
felt
on
the
plains
one
day
when
one
of
our
seventh
cavalry
officers
with
whom
we
had
long
been
intimately
associated
one
whom
our
people
called
fresh
smith
or
smithie
for
short
came
to
his
wife
to
get
her
to
put
on
his
coat
i
said
something
in
bantering
tones
of
his
plains
life
making
him
look
on
his
wife
as
the
indian
looks
upon
the
squaw
and
tried
to
rouse
her
to
rebellion
there
was
a
small
blaze
a
sudden
scintillation
from
a
pair
of
feminine
eyes
that
warned
me
of
wrath
to
come
the
captain
accepted
my
banter
threw
himself
into
the
saddle
laughed
back
the
advantage
of
this
new
order
of
things
where
a
man
had
a
combination
in
his
wife
of
servant
and
companion
and
tore
out
of
sight
leaving
me
to
settle
accounts
with
the
flushed
madame
she
told
me
what
i
never
knew
and
perhaps
might
not
even
now
but
for
the
outburst
of
the
moment
that
in
the
war
smithie
had
received
a
wound
that
shattered
his
shoulder
and
though
his
arm
was
narrowly
saved
from
amputation
he
never
raised
it
again
except
a
few
inches
as
for
putting
on
his
coat
it
was
an
impossibility
one
day
in
new
york
my
husband
and
i
were
paying
our
usual
homage
to
the
shop
windows
and
to
the
beautiful
women
we
passed
when
he
suddenly
seized
my
arm
and
said
there
kiddoo
let
catch
up
with
him
i
was
skipped
over
gutters
and
sped
over
pavements
the
general
unconscious
that
such
a
gait
is
not
the
usual
movement
of
the
new
yorker
until
we
came
up
panting
each
side
of
a
tall
man
apparently
a
specimen
of
physical
perfection
the
look
of
longing
that
he
gave
us
as
we
ran
up
flushed
and
happy
startled
me
and
i
could
scarcely
wait
until
we
separated
to
know
the
meaning
it
was
this
general
joseph
kiddoo
shot
in
the
leg
during
the
war
had
still
the
open
wound
from
which
he
endured
daily
pain
and
nightly
torture
for
he
got
only
fragmentary
sleep
to
heal
the
hurt
was
to
end
his
life
the
surgeons
said
when
at
last
i
heard
he
had
been
given
release
and
slept
the
blessed
sleep
what
word
of
sorrow
could
be
framed
in
the
case
of
another
friend
with
whom
we
were
staying
in
tennessee
from
whom
my
husband
and
i
extracted
the
information
by
dint
of
questions
and
sympathy
when
late
one
night
we
sat
about
the
open
fire
and
were
warmed
into
confidence
by
its
friendly
glow
we
found
that
no
single
night
for
the
twelve
years
after
the
war
had
such
a
boon
as
uninterrupted
sleep
been
known
to
him
a
body
racked
by
pain
was
paying
daily
its
loyal
uncomplaining
tribute
to
his
country
few
were
aware
that
he
had
unremitting
suffering
as
his
constant
companion
i
remember
that
my
husband
urged
him
to
marry
and
get
some
good
out
of
life
and
from
the
sympathy
that
wells
perpetually
in
a
tender
heart
but
he
denied
himself
the
blessing
of
such
companionship
from
unselfish
motives
declaring
he
could
not
ask
a
woman
to
link
her
fate
with
such
a
broken
life
as
his
when
we
left
his
fireside
my
husband
counted
him
a
hero
of
such
rare
mettle
that
few
in
his
experience
could
equal
him
and
years
afterward
when
we
sometimes
read
his
name
in
print
he
said
poor
i
wonder
if
there
any
for
the
brave
fellow
our
was
a
great
pleasure
to
us
and
to
our
two
families
my
own
father
was
proud
of
the
general
administration
of
civil
as
well
as
military
affairs
in
texas
and
enjoyed
the
congratulatory
letter
of
governor
hamilton
deeply
the
temptations
to
induce
general
custer
to
leave
the
service
and
enter
civil
life
began
at
once
and
were
many
and
varied
he
had
not
been
subjected
to
such
allurements
the
year
after
the
war
when
the
country
was
offering
posts
of
honor
to
returned
soldiers
but
this
summer
of
our
return
from
texas
all
sorts
of
suggestions
were
made
business
propositions
with
enticing
pictures
of
great
wealth
came
to
him
he
never
cared
for
money
for
money
sake
no
one
that
does
ever
lets
it
slip
through
his
fingers
as
he
did
still
his
heart
was
set
upon
plans
for
his
mother
and
father
and
for
his
future
and
i
can
scarcely
see
now
how
a
man
of
could
have
turned
his
back
upon
such
alluring
schemes
for
wealth
as
were
held
out
to
him
it
was
at
that
time
much
more
customary
than
now
even
to
establish
corporations
with
an
officer
name
at
the
head
who
was
known
to
have
come
through
the
war
with
irreproachable
honor
proved
possibly
as
much
by
his
being
as
poor
when
he
came
out
of
service
as
when
he
went
in
as
by
his
conduct
in
battle
the
country
was
so
unsettled
by
the
four
years
of
strife
that
it
was
like
beginning
all
over
again
when
old
companies
were
started
anew
confidence
had
to
be
struggled
for
and
names
of
prominent
men
as
associate
partners
or
presidents
were
sought
for
persistently
politics
offered
another
form
of
temptation
the
people
demanded
for
their
representatives
the
soldiers
under
whom
they
had
served
preferring
to
follow
the
same
leaders
in
the
political
field
that
had
led
them
in
battle
the
old
soldiers
and
civilians
also
talked
openly
of
general
custer
for
congressman
or
governor
it
was
a
summer
of
excitement
and
uncertainty
how
could
it
be
otherwise
to
a
boy
who
five
brief
years
before
was
a
beardless
youth
with
no
apparent
future
before
him
i
was
too
much
of
a
girl
to
realize
what
a
summer
it
was
indeed
we
had
little
chance
so
fast
did
one
proposition
for
our
future
follow
upon
the
other
when
the
general
was
offered
the
appointment
of
foreign
minister
i
kept
silence
as
best
i
could
but
it
was
desperately
hard
work
honors
according
to
old
saws
were
empty
but
in
that
time
they
looked
very
different
to
me
i
was
inwardly
very
proud
and
if
i
concealed
the
fact
because
my
husband
expressed
such
horror
of
inflated
people
it
was
only
after
violent
effort
among
the
first
propositions
was
one
for
the
general
to
take
temporary
service
with
mexico
this
scheme
found
no
favor
with
me
it
meant
more
fighting
and
further
danger
for
my
husband
and
anxiety
and
separation
for
me
besides
texas
association
with
mexicans
made
me
think
their
soldiery
treacherous
and
unreliable
but
even
in
the
midst
of
the
suspense
pending
the
decision
i
was
not
insensible
to
this
new
honor
that
was
offered
carvajal
who
was
then
at
the
head
of
the
juarez
military
government
offered
the
post
of
of
mexico
to
general
custer
the
money
inducements
were
to
give
twice
the
salary
in
gold
that
a
in
our
army
receives
as
his
salary
had
come
down
from
a
pay
of
to
this
might
have
been
a
temptation
surely
there
was
a
stipulation
that
one
or
two
thousand
men
should
be
raised
in
the
united
states
any
debts
assumed
in
organizing
this
force
to
be
paid
by
the
mexican
liberal
government
señor
romero
the
mexican
minister
did
what
he
could
to
further
the
application
of
carvajal
and
general
grant
wrote
his
approval
of
general
acceptance
in
a
letter
in
which
he
speaks
of
my
husband
in
unusually
flattering
terms
as
one
who
rendered
such
distinguished
service
as
a
cavalry
officer
during
the
war
adding
there
was
no
officer
in
that
branch
of
the
service
who
had
the
confidence
of
general
sheridan
to
a
greater
degree
than
general
custer
and
there
is
no
officer
in
whose
judgment
i
have
greater
faith
than
in
sheridan
please
understand
then
that
i
mean
to
endorse
general
custer
in
a
high
degree
the
stagnation
of
peace
was
being
felt
by
those
who
had
lived
a
breathless
four
years
at
the
front
however
much
they
might
rejoice
that
carnage
had
ceased
and
no
more
broken
hearts
need
be
dreaded
it
was
very
hard
to
quiet
themselves
into
a
life
of
inaction
no
wonder
our
officers
went
to
the
khedive
for
service
no
wonder
this
promise
of
active
duty
was
an
inviting
prospect
for
my
husband
it
took
a
long
time
for
civilians
even
to
tone
themselves
down
to
the
of
peace
everything
looked
at
that
time
as
if
there
was
success
awaiting
any
soldier
who
was
resolute
enough
to
lead
troops
against
one
they
considered
an
invader
nothing
nerves
a
soldier
arm
like
the
wrong
felt
at
the
presence
of
foreigners
on
their
own
ground
and
the
prospect
of
destruction
of
their
homes
maximilian
was
then
uncertain
in
his
hold
on
the
government
he
had
established
and
as
it
soon
proved
it
would
have
been
what
general
custer
then
thought
comparatively
an
easy
matter
to
drive
out
the
usurper
the
question
was
settled
by
the
refusing
to
grant
the
year
leave
for
which
application
was
made
and
the
general
was
too
fond
of
his
country
to
take
any
but
temporary
service
in
another
this
decision
made
me
very
grateful
and
when
there
was
no
longer
danger
of
further
exposure
of
life
i
was
also
thankful
for
the
expressions
of
confidence
and
admiration
of
my
husband
ability
as
a
soldier
that
this
contemplated
move
had
drawn
out
i
was
willing
my
husband
should
accept
any
offer
he
had
received
except
the
last
i
was
tempted
to
beg
him
to
resign
for
this
meant
peace
of
mind
and
a
long
tranquil
life
for
me
it
was
my
father
counsel
alone
that
kept
me
from
urging
each
new
proposition
to
take
up
the
life
of
a
civilian
he
advised
me
to
forget
myself
he
knew
well
what
a
difficult
task
it
was
to
school
myself
to
endure
the
life
on
which
i
had
entered
so
thoughtlessly
as
a
girl
i
had
never
been
thrown
with
army
people
and
knew
nothing
before
my
marriage
of
the
separations
and
anxieties
of
military
life
indeed
i
was
so
young
that
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
people
could
become
so
attached
to
each
other
that
it
would
be
misery
to
be
separated
and
now
that
this
divided
existence
loomed
up
before
me
father
did
not
blame
me
for
longing
for
any
life
that
would
ensure
our
being
together
he
had
a
keen
sense
of
humor
and
could
not
help
reminding
me
occasionally
when
i
told
him
despairingly
that
i
could
not
i
simply
not
live
a
life
where
i
could
not
be
always
with
my
husband
of
days
before
i
knew
the
general
when
i
declared
to
my
parents
if
ever
i
did
marry
it
would
not
be
a
dentist
as
our
opposite
neighbor
appeared
never
to
leave
the
house
it
seemed
to
me
then
that
the
wife
had
a
great
deal
to
endure
in
the
constant
presence
of
her
husband
my
father
strict
in
his
sense
of
duty
constantly
appealed
to
me
to
consider
only
my
husband
interests
and
forget
my
own
selfish
desires
in
an
old
letter
written
at
that
time
i
quoted
to
the
general
something
that
father
had
said
to
me
why
daughter
i
would
rather
have
the
honor
which
grows
out
of
the
way
in
which
the
battle
of
waynesboro
was
fought
than
to
have
the
wealth
of
the
indies
armstrong
battle
is
better
to
hand
down
to
posterity
than
wealth
he
used
in
those
days
to
walk
the
floor
and
say
to
me
my
child
put
no
obstacles
in
the
way
to
the
fulfillment
of
his
destiny
he
chose
his
profession
he
is
a
born
soldier
there
he
must
abide
in
the
midst
of
this
indecision
when
the
general
was
obliged
to
be
in
new
york
and
washington
on
business
my
father
was
taken
ill
the
one
whom
i
so
sorely
needed
in
all
those
ten
years
that
followed
when
i
was
often
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
dangers
and
anxieties
and
vicissitudes
attending
our
life
stepped
into
heaven
as
quietly
and
peacefully
as
if
going
into
another
room
his
last
words
were
to
urge
me
to
do
my
duty
as
a
soldier
wife
he
again
begged
me
to
ignore
self
and
remember
that
my
husband
had
chosen
the
profession
of
a
soldier
in
that
life
he
had
made
a
name
and
there
where
he
was
so
eminently
fitted
to
succeed
he
should
remain
my
father
counsel
and
his
dying
words
had
great
weight
with
me
and
enabled
me
to
fight
against
the
selfishness
that
was
such
a
temptation
very
few
women
even
the
most
ambitious
for
their
husbands
future
but
would
have
confessed
at
the
close
of
the
war
that
glory
came
with
too
great
sacrifices
and
they
would
rather
gather
the
husbands
lovers
and
brothers
into
the
shelter
of
the
humblest
of
homes
than
endure
the
suspense
and
loneliness
of
war
times
i
am
sure
that
my
father
was
right
for
over
and
over
again
in
after
years
my
husband
met
his
brother
officers
who
had
resigned
only
to
have
poured
into
his
ear
regrets
that
they
had
left
the
service
i
have
known
him
to
come
to
me
often
saying
he
could
not
be
too
thankful
that
he
had
not
gone
into
civil
life
he
believed
that
a
business
man
or
a
politician
should
have
discipline
in
youth
for
the
life
and
varied
experience
with
all
kinds
of
people
to
make
a
successful
career
officers
from
the
very
nature
of
their
life
are
prescribed
in
their
associates
they
are
isolated
so
much
at
extreme
posts
that
they
know
little
or
nothing
of
the
life
of
citizens
after
resigning
they
found
themselves
robbed
of
the
companionship
so
dear
to
military
people
unable
from
want
of
early
training
to
cope
successfully
with
business
men
and
lacking
from
inexperience
the
untiring
plodding
spirit
that
is
requisite
to
the
success
of
a
civilian
an
officer
rarely
gives
a
note
his
promise
is
his
bond
it
is
seldom
violated
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
even
in
my
twelve
years
experience
to
enumerate
the
times
i
have
known
when
debts
for
which
there
was
not
a
scrap
of
written
proof
were
paid
without
solicitation
on
the
part
of
the
friend
who
was
the
creditor
one
of
our
new
york
hotels
furnishes
proof
of
how
an
word
is
considered
a
few
years
since
congress
failed
to
make
the
usual
yearly
appropriation
for
the
pay
of
the
army
a
hotel
that
had
been
for
many
years
the
resort
of
military
people
immediately
sent
far
and
wide
to
notify
the
army
that
no
bills
would
be
presented
until
the
next
congress
had
passed
the
appropriation
to
satisfy
myself
i
have
inquired
if
they
lost
by
this
and
been
assured
that
they
did
not
men
reared
to
consider
their
word
equal
to
the
most
binding
legal
contract
ever
made
would
naturally
find
it
difficult
to
realize
when
entering
civil
life
that
something
else
is
considered
necessary
the
wary
take
advantage
of
the
credulity
of
a
military
man
and
usually
the
first
experience
is
financial
loss
to
an
officer
who
has
confidingly
allowed
a
debt
to
be
contracted
without
all
the
restrictive
legal
arrangements
with
which
citizens
have
found
it
necessary
to
surround
money
transactions
and
so
the
world
goes
the
capital
with
which
an
officer
enters
into
business
is
lost
by
too
much
confidence
in
his
brother
man
and
when
he
becomes
richer
by
experience
he
is
so
poor
in
pocket
he
can
not
venture
into
competition
with
the
trained
and
skilled
business
men
among
whom
he
had
entered
so
sanguinely
politics
also
have
often
proved
disastrous
to
army
officers
allured
by
promises
they
have
accepted
office
and
been
allowed
a
brief
success
but
who
can
be
more
completely
done
for
than
an
whose
party
goes
out
of
power
the
born
politician
one
who
has
grown
wary
in
the
great
game
provides
for
the
season
of
temporary
retirement
which
the
superseding
of
his
party
necessitates
his
antagonist
calls
it
feathering
his
nest
but
a
and
sanguine
military
man
has
done
no
feathering
and
it
is
simply
pitiful
to
see
to
what
obscurity
and
absolute
poverty
they
are
brought
the
men
whose
chestnuts
the
ingenuous
unsuspecting
man
has
pulled
out
of
the
fire
now
pass
him
by
unnoticed
such
an
existence
to
a
proud
man
makes
him
wish
he
had
died
on
the
field
of
battle
before
any
act
of
his
had
brought
chagrin
all
these
things
i
have
heard
my
husband
say
when
we
have
encountered
some
heartbroken
man
and
he
worked
for
nothing
harder
than
that
they
might
be
reinstated
in
the
service
or
lifted
out
of
their
perplexities
by
occupation
of
some
sort
there
was
an
officer
a
classmate
at
west
point
who
he
felt
with
all
his
heart
did
right
in
resigning
if
he
had
lived
he
would
have
written
his
tribute
and
i
venture
to
take
up
his
pen
to
say
in
my
inadequate
way
what
he
would
have
said
so
well
moved
by
the
eloquence
of
deep
feeling
my
husband
believed
in
what
people
term
a
calling
and
he
himself
had
felt
a
call
to
be
a
soldier
when
he
could
scarcely
speak
plain
it
was
not
the
usual
early
love
of
boys
for
adventure
we
realize
how
natural
it
is
for
a
lad
to
enjoy
tales
of
hotly
contested
fields
and
to
glory
over
bloodshed
the
boy
in
the
when
asked
what
part
of
the
bible
he
best
liked
said
promptly
the
fightenest
part
and
another
when
his
saintly
teacher
questioned
him
as
to
whom
he
first
wished
to
see
when
he
reached
heaven
vociferated
loudly
goliath
but
the
love
of
a
soldier
life
was
not
the
fleeting
desire
of
the
child
in
my
husband
it
became
the
steady
purpose
of
his
youth
the
happy
realization
of
his
early
manhood
for
this
reason
he
sympathized
with
all
who
felt
themselves
drawn
to
a
certain
place
in
the
world
he
thoroughly
believed
in
a
boy
if
it
was
not
a
pernicious
choice
having
his
bent
and
so
it
happened
when
it
was
our
good
fortune
to
be
stationed
with
his
classmate
colonel
charles
parsons
at
leavenworth
that
he
gave
a
ready
ear
when
his
old
west
point
chum
poured
out
his
longings
for
a
different
sphere
in
life
he
used
to
come
to
me
after
these
sessions
when
the
colonel
went
over
and
over
again
his
reasons
for
resigning
and
wonder
how
he
could
wish
to
do
so
but
he
respected
his
friend
belief
that
he
had
another
calling
too
thoroughly
to
oppose
him
he
thought
the
place
of
captain
of
a
battery
of
artillery
the
most
independent
in
the
service
he
is
detached
from
his
regiment
he
reports
only
to
the
commanding
officer
of
the
post
he
is
left
so
long
at
one
station
that
he
can
make
permanent
arrangements
for
comfort
and
except
in
times
of
war
the
work
is
garrison
and
guard
duty
besides
this
the
pay
of
a
captain
of
a
battery
is
good
and
he
is
not
subject
to
constant
moves
which
tax
the
finances
of
a
cavalry
officer
so
severely
after
enumerating
these
advantages
he
ended
by
saying
there
nothing
to
be
done
though
for
if
parsons
thinks
he
ought
to
go
into
an
uncertainty
and
leave
what
is
a
surety
for
life
why
he
ought
to
follow
his
convictions
the
next
time
we
saw
the
colonel
he
was
the
rector
of
a
small
mission
church
on
the
outskirts
of
memphis
we
were
with
the
party
of
the
grand
duke
alexis
when
he
went
by
steamer
to
new
orleans
general
sheridan
had
asked
general
custer
to
go
on
a
with
the
duke
in
the
territory
of
wyoming
and
he
in
turn
urged
the
general
to
remain
with
him
afterward
until
he
left
the
country
at
memphis
the
city
gave
a
ball
and
my
husband
begged
his
old
comrade
to
be
present
it
was
the
first
time
since
his
resignation
that
the
colonel
and
his
beautiful
wife
had
been
in
society
their
parish
was
poor
and
they
had
only
a
small
and
uncertain
salary
colonel
parsons
was
not
in
the
least
daunted
he
was
as
hopeful
and
as
enthusiastic
as
such
earnest
people
alone
can
be
as
certain
he
was
right
as
if
his
duty
had
been
revealed
to
him
as
divine
messages
were
to
the
prophets
of
old
the
general
was
touched
by
the
fearless
manner
in
which
he
faced
poverty
and
obscurity
it
would
be
necessary
for
one
to
know
by
actual
observation
what
a
position
of
authority
of
independence
of
assured
and
sufficient
income
he
left
to
sink
his
individuality
in
this
life
that
he
consecrated
to
his
master
when
he
entered
our
room
before
we
went
to
the
ballroom
he
held
up
his
gloved
hands
to
us
and
said
custer
i
wish
you
to
realize
into
what
extravagance
you
have
plunged
me
why
old
fellow
this
is
my
first
indulgence
in
such
frivolities
since
i
came
down
here
parsons
was
a
marvel
to
us
the
general
had
no
words
that
he
thought
high
enough
praise
for
her
sacrifice
hers
was
for
her
husband
and
not
a
complaint
did
she
utter
here
again
i
should
have
to
take
my
citizen
reader
into
garrison
before
i
could
make
clear
what
it
was
that
she
gave
up
the
vision
of
that
pretty
woman
as
i
remember
her
at
leavenworth
is
fresh
in
my
mind
she
danced
and
rode
charmingly
and
was
gracious
and
free
from
the
spiteful
envy
that
sometimes
comes
when
a
garrison
belle
is
so
attractive
that
the
gossips
say
she
absorbs
all
the
devotion
colonel
parsons
not
caring
much
for
dancing
used
to
stand
and
watch
with
pride
and
complete
confidence
when
the
men
gathered
round
his
wife
at
our
hops
there
were
usually
more
than
twice
as
many
men
as
women
and
the
card
of
a
good
dancer
and
a
favorite
was
frequently
filled
before
she
left
her
own
house
for
the
i
find
myself
still
wondering
how
any
pretty
woman
ever
kept
her
mental
poise
when
queening
it
at
those
western
posts
my
husband
who
never
failed
to
be
the
first
to
notice
the
least
sacrifice
that
a
woman
made
for
her
husband
looked
upon
parsons
with
more
and
more
surprise
and
admiration
as
he
contrasted
the
life
in
which
we
found
her
with
her
former
fascinating
existence
the
colonel
after
making
his
concession
and
coming
to
our
ball
asked
us
in
turn
to
be
present
at
his
church
on
the
following
sunday
and
gave
the
general
a
little
cheap
printed
card
which
he
used
to
find
his
way
to
the
suburbs
of
the
city
colonel
parsons
told
me
next
day
that
when
he
entered
the
and
looked
down
upon
the
dignified
reverent
head
of
my
husband
a
remembrance
of
the
last
time
he
had
seen
him
in
the
chapel
at
west
point
came
like
a
flash
of
lightning
into
his
mind
and
he
almost
had
a
convulsion
in
endeavoring
to
suppress
the
gurgles
of
laughter
that
struggled
for
expression
for
an
instant
he
thought
with
desperate
fright
that
he
would
drop
down
behind
the
desk
and
have
it
out
and
only
by
the
most
powerful
effort
did
he
rally
it
seems
that
a
cadet
in
their
corps
had
fiery
red
hair
and
during
the
stupid
chapel
sermon
cadet
custer
had
run
his
fingers
into
the
boy
hair
who
was
in
front
of
him
pretending
to
get
them
into
white
heat
and
then
taking
them
out
pounded
them
as
on
an
anvil
it
was
a
simple
thing
and
a
trick
dating
many
years
back
but
the
drollery
and
quickness
of
action
made
it
something
a
man
could
not
recall
with
calmness
colonel
parsons
and
his
wife
are
receiving
the
rewards
that
only
heaven
can
give
to
lives
of
parsons
after
they
came
north
to
a
parish
only
lived
a
short
time
to
enjoy
the
comfort
of
an
eastern
home
when
the
yellow
fever
raged
so
in
the
mississippi
valley
in
and
volunteers
came
forward
with
all
the
splendid
generosity
of
this
part
of
the
world
colonel
parsons
did
not
wait
a
second
call
from
his
conscience
to
enter
the
memphis
and
there
he
ended
a
martyr
life
not
only
ready
to
go
because
in
his
master
service
but
because
the
best
of
his
life
and
one
for
whom
he
continually
sorrowed
awaited
him
beyond
the
confines
of
eternity
chapter
xi
orders
to
report
at
fort
riley
kansas
general
custer
was
the
recipient
of
much
kindness
from
the
soldiers
of
his
michigan
brigade
while
he
remained
in
michigan
awaiting
orders
and
he
went
to
several
towns
where
his
old
comrades
had
prepared
receptions
for
him
but
when
he
returned
from
a
reunion
in
detroit
to
our
saddened
home
there
was
no
grateful
proud
father
to
listen
to
the
accounts
of
the
soldiers
enthusiasm
my
husband
missed
his
commendation
and
his
proud
way
of
referring
to
his
son
his
own
family
were
near
us
and
off
he
started
when
he
felt
the
absence
of
the
noble
parent
who
had
so
proudly
followed
his
career
and
running
through
our
stable
to
shorten
the
distance
danced
up
a
lane
through
a
back
gate
into
his
garden
and
thence
into
the
midst
of
his
father
noisy
and
happy
household
his
parents
the
younger
brother
boston
sister
margaret
colonel
tom
and
often
eliza
made
up
the
family
and
the
uproar
that
these
boys
and
the
elder
boy
their
father
made
around
the
gentle
mother
and
her
daughters
was
a
marvel
to
me
if
the
general
went
away
to
some
soldiers
reunion
he
tried
on
his
return
to
give
me
a
lucid
account
of
the
ceremonies
and
how
signally
he
failed
in
making
a
speech
of
course
and
his
subterfuge
for
hiding
his
confusion
and
getting
out
of
the
scrape
by
proposing
garry
owen
by
the
band
or
three
cheers
for
the
old
brigade
it
was
not
that
he
had
not
enough
to
say
his
heart
was
full
of
gratitude
to
his
comrades
but
the
words
came
forth
with
such
a
rush
there
was
little
chance
of
arriving
at
the
meaning
i
think
nothing
moved
him
in
this
coming
together
of
his
dear
soldiers
like
his
pride
at
their
naming
babies
after
him
his
eyes
danced
with
pleasure
when
he
told
that
they
stopped
him
in
the
street
and
held
up
a
little
george
armstrong
custer
and
the
shy
wife
was
brought
forward
to
be
congratulated
i
dearly
loved
when
i
chanced
to
be
with
him
to
witness
their
pride
and
hear
their
few
words
of
praise
not
long
ago
i
was
in
a
small
town
in
michigan
among
some
of
my
husband
old
soldiers
our
sister
margaret
was
reciting
for
the
benefit
of
the
little
church
and
the
veterans
asked
for
me
afterward
and
i
shook
hands
with
a
long
line
of
bronzed
heroes
now
tillers
of
the
soil
their
praise
of
their
boy
general
made
my
grateful
tears
flow
and
many
of
their
eyes
moistened
as
they
held
my
hand
and
spoke
of
war
times
after
all
had
filed
by
they
began
to
return
one
by
one
and
ask
to
bring
their
wives
and
children
one
soldier
with
already
silvering
head
said
quaintly
we
have
often
seen
you
riding
around
with
our
general
in
war
days
and
added
with
a
most
flattering
ignoring
of
time
treatment
of
me
you
look
the
same
though
you
was
a
young
gal
then
and
now
tho
you
followed
your
husband
and
took
your
hardships
with
us
i
want
to
show
you
an
old
woman
who
was
also
a
purty
good
soldier
for
while
i
was
away
at
the
front
she
run
the
farm
such
a
welcome
such
honest
tribute
to
his
old
woman
recalled
the
times
when
the
general
old
soldiers
gathered
about
him
with
unaffected
words
and
when
i
pitied
him
because
he
fidgeted
so
and
bit
his
lips
and
struggled
to
end
what
was
the
joy
of
his
life
for
fear
he
would
cry
like
a
woman
among
those
who
sought
him
out
that
summer
was
an
officer
who
had
commanded
a
regiment
of
troops
in
the
celebrated
michigan
brigade
colonel
george
grey
a
brave
irishman
with
as
much
enthusiasm
in
his
friendships
as
in
his
fighting
his
wife
and
little
son
were
introduced
the
boy
had
very
light
hair
and
though
taught
to
reverence
and
love
the
general
by
his
gallant
impulsive
father
the
child
had
never
realized
until
he
saw
him
that
his
father
hero
also
had
a
yellow
head
heretofore
the
boy
had
hated
his
hair
and
implored
his
mother
to
dye
it
dark
but
as
soon
as
his
interview
with
my
husband
was
ended
he
ran
to
his
mother
and
whispered
in
eager
haste
that
she
need
not
mind
the
dyeing
now
he
never
would
scold
about
his
hair
being
light
again
since
he
had
seen
that
general
custer
was
yellow
as
i
look
back
and
consider
what
a
descent
the
of
the
war
made
on
returning
to
their
lineal
rank
in
the
regular
army
after
the
surrender
at
appomattox
i
wonder
how
they
took
the
new
order
of
things
so
calmly
or
that
they
so
readily
adapted
themselves
to
the
positions
they
had
filled
before
the
firing
on
sumter
in
general
custer
held
his
commission
as
brevet
for
nearly
a
year
after
the
close
of
hostilities
and
until
relieved
in
texas
he
did
not
go
at
once
to
his
regiment
the
fifth
cavalry
and
take
up
the
command
of
sixty
men
in
place
of
thousands
as
other
officers
of
the
regular
army
were
obliged
to
do
but
was
placed
on
waiting
orders
and
recommended
to
the
of
one
of
the
new
regiments
of
cavalry
for
five
new
ones
had
been
formed
that
summer
making
ten
in
all
in
the
autumn
the
appointment
to
the
seventh
cavalry
came
with
orders
to
go
to
fort
garland
one
would
have
imagined
by
the
jubilant
manner
in
which
this
official
document
was
unfolded
and
read
to
me
that
it
was
the
inheritance
of
a
principality
my
husband
instantly
began
to
go
over
the
good
sides
of
the
question
he
was
so
given
to
dwelling
on
the
high
lights
of
any
picture
his
imagination
painted
that
the
background
which
might
mean
hardships
and
deprivations
became
indefinite
in
outline
and
obscure
enough
in
detail
to
please
the
most
modern
impressionists
out
of
our
camp
luggage
a
map
was
produced
and
fort
garland
was
discovered
after
long
prowling
about
with
the
first
finger
in
the
space
given
to
the
rocky
mountains
then
he
launched
into
visions
of
what
unspeakable
pleasure
he
would
have
fishing
for
mountain
trout
and
hunting
deer
as
i
cared
nothing
for
fishing
and
was
afraid
of
a
gun
i
do
recall
my
veins
bounding
as
his
did
over
the
prospect
but
the
embryo
fisherman
and
nimrod
was
so
sanguine
over
his
future
it
would
have
been
a
stolid
soul
indeed
that
did
not
begin
to
think
fort
garland
a
sort
of
earthly
paradise
the
sober
colors
in
this
vivid
picture
meant
a
small
obscure
post
then
several
hundred
miles
from
any
railroad
not
much
more
than
a
handful
of
men
to
command
the
most
complete
isolation
and
no
prospect
of
an
active
campaign
as
it
was
far
from
the
range
of
the
warlike
indians
but
fort
garland
soon
faded
from
our
view
in
the
excitement
and
interest
over
fort
riley
as
soon
as
our
orders
were
changed
to
that
post
we
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
it
on
the
map
as
it
was
comparatively
an
old
post
and
the
kansas
pacific
railroad
was
within
ten
miles
of
the
government
reservation
we
ascertained
by
inquiry
that
it
was
better
to
buy
the
necessary
household
articles
at
leavenworth
than
to
attempt
to
carry
along
even
a
simple
outfit
from
the
east
my
attention
had
been
so
concentrated
on
the
war
that
i
found
the
map
of
virginia
had
heretofore
comprised
the
only
important
part
of
the
united
states
to
me
and
it
was
difficult
to
realize
that
kansas
had
a
city
of
inhabitants
with
several
daily
papers
still
i
was
quite
willing
to
trust
to
leavenworth
for
the
purchase
of
household
furniture
as
it
seemed
to
me
what
afterward
proved
true
that
housekeeping
in
garrison
quarters
was
a
sort
of
camping
out
after
all
with
one
foot
in
a
house
and
another
in
position
to
put
into
the
stirrup
and
spin
over
the
hills
and
far
away
we
packed
the
few
traps
that
had
been
used
in
camping
in
virginia
and
texas
but
most
of
our
attention
was
given
to
the
selection
of
a
pretty
girl
who
it
was
held
by
both
of
us
would
do
more
toward
furnishing
and
beautifying
our
army
quarters
than
any
amount
of
speechless
or
silent
tapestry
it
was
difficult
to
obtain
what
seemed
the
one
thing
needful
for
our
new
army
home
in
the
first
place
the
mothers
rose
and
formed
themselves
into
an
combination
they
looked
right
into
my
eyes
with
harassed
expression
and
said
why
libbie
they
might
marry
an
officer
ignoring
the
fact
that
the
happiest
girl
among
them
had
undergone
that
awful
fate
and
still
laughed
back
a
denial
of
its
being
the
bitterest
lot
that
can
come
to
a
woman
then
i
argued
that
perhaps
their
daughters
might
escape
matrimony
entirely
under
the
fearful
circumstances
which
they
shuddered
over
even
in
contemplation
but
that
it
was
only
fair
that
the
girls
should
have
a
chance
to
see
the
bravest
and
the
tenderest
and
i
mentally
added
the
livest
men
for
our
town
had
been
forsaken
by
most
of
the
ambitious
energetic
boys
as
soon
as
their
ended
the
beau
season
was
very
brief
lasting
only
during
their
summer
vacations
when
they
came
from
western
towns
to
make
love
in
sleepy
monroe
one
mother
at
last
listened
to
my
arguments
and
said
i
do
want
laura
to
see
what
men
of
the
world
are
and
she
shall
go
now
this
lovely
mother
had
been
almost
a
second
one
to
me
in
all
my
lonely
vacations
after
my
own
mother
died
she
took
me
from
the
seminary
and
gave
me
treats
with
her
own
children
and
has
influenced
my
whole
life
by
her
noble
large
way
of
looking
at
the
world
but
then
she
has
been
east
a
great
deal
and
in
washington
in
president
pierce
days
and
realized
that
the
vision
of
the
outside
world
seen
only
from
our
monroe
was
narrow
the
dear
laura
surprised
me
by
asking
to
have
over
night
to
consider
and
i
could
not
account
for
it
as
she
had
been
so
radiant
over
the
prospect
of
military
life
alas
next
morning
the
riddle
was
solved
when
she
whispered
in
my
ear
that
there
was
a
youth
who
had
already
taken
into
his
hands
the
disposal
of
her
future
and
he
objected
so
we
lost
her
monroe
was
then
thought
to
have
more
pretty
girls
than
any
place
of
its
size
in
the
country
in
my
first
experience
of
the
misery
of
being
paragraphed
it
was
announced
that
general
custer
had
taken
to
himself
a
wife
in
a
town
where
marriageable
girls
were
left
the
fame
of
the
town
had
gone
abroad
though
and
the
were
not
without
opportunities
widowers
came
from
afar
with
avant
couriers
in
the
shape
of
letters
describing
their
wealth
their
scholarly
attainments
and
their
position
in
the
community
the
boys
grown
to
men
halted
in
their
race
for
wealth
long
enough
to
rush
home
and
propose
often
we
were
all
under
inspection
and
though
demure
and
seemingly
unconscious
i
remember
the
walks
when
a
knot
of
girls
went
off
to
lovers
lane
to
exchange
experiences
about
some
stranger
from
afar
who
had
been
brought
around
by
a
solicitous
to
view
the
landscape
and
i
am
afraid
we
had
some
sly
little
congratulations
when
he
having
shown
signs
of
the
conquering
hero
was
finally
sent
on
his
way
to
seek
in
other
towns
filled
with
girls
fresh
woods
and
pastures
new
i
can
not
account
for
the
beauty
of
the
women
of
monroe
the
mothers
were
the
softest
serenest
women
even
when
it
is
true
it
was
a
very
quiet
life
going
to
bed
with
the
chickens
and
up
early
enough
to
see
the
dew
on
the
lawns
there
was
very
little
care
to
plant
furrows
in
the
cheeks
and
those
radiating
lines
about
the
eyes
nearly
everybody
was
above
want
and
few
had
enough
of
this
world
goods
to
incite
envy
in
the
hearts
of
the
neighbors
which
does
its
share
in
a
younger
face
i
sometimes
think
the
vicinity
of
lake
erie
and
the
moist
air
that
blew
over
the
marsh
kept
the
complexions
fresh
i
used
to
feel
actually
sorry
for
my
husband
when
we
approached
monroe
after
coming
from
the
campaigns
he
often
said
shall
we
not
stop
in
detroit
a
day
or
two
libbie
till
you
get
the
tired
look
out
of
your
face
i
dread
going
among
the
monroe
women
and
seeing
them
cast
reproachful
looks
at
me
when
your
sunburned
face
is
introduced
among
their
fair
complexions
when
you
are
tired
in
addition
they
seem
to
think
i
am
a
wretch
unhung
and
say
general
what
you
done
with
libbie
transparent
skin
i
am
afraid
it
is
hopelessly
dark
and
irredeemably
thickened
in
vain
i
argued
that
it
would
be
too
thick
to
let
them
all
see
the
happy
light
shine
through
and
if
his
affection
survived
my
altered
looks
i
felt
able
to
endure
the
wailing
over
what
they
thought
i
had
lost
after
all
it
was
very
dear
and
kind
of
them
to
care
and
my
husband
appreciated
their
solicitude
even
when
he
was
supposed
to
be
in
disgrace
for
having
subjected
me
to
such
disfigurement
still
these
mothers
were
neither
going
to
run
the
risk
of
the
and
cream
of
their
precious
girls
all
running
riot
into
one
broad
sunburn
up
to
the
roots
of
the
hair
and
this
was
another
reason
in
addition
to
the
paramount
one
that
the
girls
marry
into
the
army
the
vagrant
life
the
inability
to
keep
household
gods
giving
up
the
privileges
of
the
church
and
missionary
societies
the
loss
of
the
simple
village
gayety
the
anxiety
and
suspense
of
a
soldier
wife
might
well
make
the
mothers
opposed
to
the
life
but
this
latter
reason
did
not
enter
into
all
their
minds
some
thought
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
one
said
in
trying
to
persuade
me
that
it
was
better
to
break
my
engagement
with
the
general
why
girl
you
ca
be
a
poor
man
wife
and
besides
he
might
lose
a
leg
i
thought
even
then
gay
and
seemingly
thoughtless
as
i
was
that
a
short
life
with
poverty
and
a
wooden
leg
was
better
than
the
career
suggested
to
me
i
hope
the
dear
old
lady
is
not
blushing
as
she
reads
this
and
i
remind
her
how
she
took
me
up
into
a
high
mountain
and
pointed
out
a
house
that
might
be
mine
with
so
many
dozen
spoons
solid
so
many
sheets
and
closets
filled
with
jars
of
preserved
fruit
all
of
which
i
could
not
hope
to
have
in
the
life
in
which
i
chose
to
cast
my
lot
where
peaches
ripened
on
no
and
were
unknown
illustration
general
custer
with
his
horse
vic
stag
hounds
and
deer
hounds
when
we
were
ready
to
set
out
for
the
west
in
october
our
caravan
summed
up
something
like
this
list
my
husband
three
horses
jack
rucker
the
thoroughbred
mare
he
had
bought
in
texas
a
blooded
colt
from
virginia
named
phil
sheridan
and
my
own
horse
a
fast
pacer
named
custis
lee
the
delight
of
my
eyes
and
the
envy
of
the
general
staff
while
we
were
in
virginia
and
texas
several
hounds
given
to
the
general
by
the
planters
with
whom
he
had
hunted
deer
in
texas
a
superb
greyhound
his
head
carried
so
loftily
as
he
walked
his
lordly
way
among
the
other
dogs
that
i
thought
he
would
have
asked
to
carry
his
on
his
brass
collar
could
he
have
spoken
for
his
rights
last
of
all
some
one
had
given
us
the
ugliest
white
i
ever
saw
but
in
time
we
came
to
think
that
the
twist
in
his
lumpy
tail
the
curve
in
his
bow
legs
the
ambitious
nose
which
drew
the
upper
lip
above
the
heaviest
of
protruding
jaws
were
simply
beauties
for
the
dog
was
so
affectionate
and
loyal
that
everything
which
at
first
seemed
a
leaned
finally
to
virtue
side
he
was
well
named
turk
and
a
set
to
or
so
with
byron
the
domineering
greyhound
established
his
rights
so
that
it
only
needed
a
deep
growl
and
an
uprising
of
the
bristles
on
his
back
to
recall
to
the
overbearing
aristocrat
some
wholesome
lessons
given
him
when
the
acquaintance
began
turk
was
devoted
to
the
colt
phil
and
the
intimacy
of
the
two
was
comical
phil
repaid
turk
little
playful
nips
at
the
legs
by
lifting
him
in
his
teeth
as
high
as
the
by
the
loose
skin
of
his
back
but
nothing
could
get
a
whimper
out
of
him
for
he
was
the
pluckiest
of
brutes
he
curled
himself
up
in
phil
stall
when
he
slept
and
in
traveling
was
his
close
companion
in
the
box
car
if
we
took
the
dog
to
drive
with
us
he
had
to
be
in
the
buggy
as
our
time
otherwise
would
have
been
constantly
engaged
in
dragging
him
off
from
any
dog
that
strutted
around
him
and
needed
a
lesson
in
humility
when
turk
was
returned
to
phil
after
any
separation
they
greeted
each
other
in
a
most
human
way
turk
leaped
around
the
colt
and
in
turn
was
rubbed
and
nosed
about
with
speaking
little
snorts
of
welcome
when
we
came
home
to
this
ugly
duckling
he
usually
made
a
spring
and
landed
in
my
lap
as
if
he
were
the
tiniest
silkiest
little
skye
in
dogdom
he
half
closed
his
eyes
with
that
beatific
expression
peculiar
to
affectionate
dogs
and
did
his
little
smile
at
my
husband
and
me
by
raising
what
there
was
of
his
upper
lip
and
showing
his
front
teeth
all
this
with
an
ignoring
of
the
other
dogs
and
an
air
of
exclusion
as
if
we
three
his
master
mistress
and
himself
composed
all
there
was
of
earth
worth
knowing
we
had
two
servants
one
being
eliza
our
faithful
colored
woman
who
had
been
with
us
in
virginia
and
texas
and
had
come
home
with
me
to
care
for
my
father
in
his
last
illness
we
had
also
a
worthless
colored
boy
who
had
been
trained
as
a
jockey
in
texas
and
had
returned
with
the
horses
what
intellect
he
had
was
employed
in
devising
schemes
to
escape
work
eliza
used
her
utmost
persuasive
eloquence
on
him
without
effect
and
failed
equally
with
a
set
of
invectives
that
had
been
known
heretofore
to
break
the
most
stubborn
case
of
lethargy
my
mother
custer
screened
him
for
he
had
soon
discovered
her
amazing
credulity
and
had
made
out
a
story
of
abuses
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
that
moved
her
to
confide
his
wrongs
to
me
two
years
before
i
too
would
have
dropped
a
tear
over
his
history
but
a
life
among
horses
had
enlightened
me
somewhat
every
one
knows
that
a
negro
will
do
almost
anything
to
become
a
jockey
their
bitterest
moment
is
when
they
find
that
growing
bone
and
muscle
is
making
avoirdupois
and
going
to
cut
them
off
from
all
that
makes
life
worth
living
to
reduce
their
weight
so
they
can
ride
at
races
they
are
steamed
and
parboiled
if
necessary
this
process
our
lazy
servant
described
to
our
mother
as
having
been
enforced
on
him
as
a
torture
and
punishment
and
such
a
good
story
did
he
make
out
that
he
did
nothing
but
lie
in
the
sun
and
twang
an
old
banjo
all
summer
long
all
owing
to
mother
pity
we
had
to
take
him
with
us
to
save
her
from
waiting
on
him
and
making
reparation
for
what
she
supposed
had
been
a
life
of
abuse
before
he
came
to
us
last
of
all
to
describe
in
our
party
was
diana
the
pretty
belle
of
monroe
the
excitement
of
anticipation
gave
added
brightness
to
her
eyes
and
the
head
sunning
over
with
a
hundred
curls
danced
and
coquetted
as
she
talked
of
our
future
among
the
brass
buttons
and
epaulets
my
going
out
from
home
was
not
so
hard
as
it
had
been
for
the
dear
father
had
gone
home
saying
in
his
last
words
daughter
continue
to
do
as
you
have
done
follow
armstrong
everywhere
it
had
indeed
been
a
temptation
to
me
to
use
all
my
influence
to
induce
my
husband
to
resign
and
accept
the
places
held
out
to
him
i
do
not
recollect
that
ambition
or
a
far
look
into
his
progress
in
the
future
entered
my
mind
i
can
only
remember
thinking
with
envy
of
men
surrounding
us
in
civil
life
who
came
home
to
their
wives
after
every
day
business
even
now
i
look
upon
a
laborer
returning
to
his
home
at
night
with
his
tin
as
a
creature
to
be
envied
and
my
imagination
follows
the
husband
into
his
humble
house
the
wife
to
whom
he
returns
may
have
lost
much
that
ambition
and
success
bring
but
she
has
secured
for
herself
a
lifetime
of
happy
twilights
when
all
she
cares
for
is
safe
under
her
affectionate
eyes
our
father
and
mother
custer
lived
near
us
and
sister
margaret
and
the
younger
brother
bos
were
then
at
home
and
in
school
the
parting
with
his
mother
the
only
sad
hour
to
my
blithe
husband
tore
his
heart
as
it
always
did
and
he
argued
in
vain
with
her
that
as
he
had
come
home
after
five
years
of
incessant
battles
she
might
look
for
his
safe
return
again
each
time
seemed
to
be
the
last
to
her
for
she
was
so
delicate
she
hardly
expected
to
live
to
see
him
again
the
summer
had
been
one
of
such
pleasure
to
her
her
beloved
boy
dashing
in
and
out
in
his
restless
manner
was
never
too
absorbed
with
whatever
took
up
his
active
mind
to
be
anything
but
gentle
and
thoughtful
for
her
she
found
our
eliza
a
mine
of
information
and
just
as
willing
as
mother
herself
to
talk
all
day
about
the
one
topic
in
common
the
general
and
his
war
experiences
then
the
dogs
and
horses
and
the
stir
and
life
produced
by
the
introduction
of
ourselves
and
our
belongings
into
her
quiet
existence
made
her
recall
the
old
farm
life
when
her
brood
of
children
were
all
around
her
brother
tom
had
spent
the
summer
skipping
from
flower
to
flower
tasting
the
sweets
of
all
the
rosebud
garden
of
girls
in
our
pretty
town
i
had
already
taken
to
myself
a
good
deal
of
the
mothering
of
this
wild
boy
and
began
to
worry
as
is
the
custom
of
mothers
over
the
advances
of
a
venturesome
woman
who
was
no
longer
young
and
playing
for
high
stakes
it
was
no
small
matter
to
me
as
i
knew
tom
would
live
with
us
always
if
he
could
manage
to
do
so
and
my
prospective
would
be
my
nearest
companion
lad
as
he
was
he
escaped
and
preserved
his
heart
in
an
unbroken
condition
during
the
summer
much
to
our
regret
he
was
appointed
to
a
lieutenancy
in
a
regiment
stationed
south
after
he
was
mustered
out
of
the
volunteer
service
but
the
general
succeeded
in
effecting
his
transfer
to
the
seventh
cavalry
and
after
a
short
service
in
the
south
he
joined
us
at
fort
riley
that
year
one
of
our
detroit
friends
invited
us
to
go
with
a
party
of
pretty
women
in
a
special
car
to
louis
so
we
had
a
gay
for
our
new
home
i
do
remember
to
have
had
an
anxiety
as
to
the
future
i
was
wholly
given
over
to
the
joy
of
realizing
that
the
war
was
over
and
now
the
one
great
danger
was
passed
i
felt
as
if
all
that
sort
of
life
was
forever
ended
at
any
rate
the
magnetic
influence
of
my
husband
joyous
temperament
which
would
not
look
on
the
dark
side
had
such
power
over
those
around
him
that
i
was
impelled
to
look
upon
our
future
as
he
did
in
louis
we
had
a
round
of
gayety
the
great
fair
was
then
at
its
best
for
every
one
was
making
haste
to
dispel
the
gloom
that
our
terrible
war
had
cast
over
the
land
there
was
not
a
corner
of
the
to
which
my
husband
did
not
penetrate
he
took
me
into
all
sorts
of
places
to
which
our
pretty
galaxy
of
belles
with
their
new
conquests
of
louis
beaux
had
no
interest
in
going
the
stalls
of
the
thoroughbred
horses
when
a
chat
with
the
jockeys
was
included
the
cattle
costing
per
head
what
we
whispered
to
each
other
would
set
us
up
in
a
handsome
income
for
life
and
buy
a
farm
with
blooded
horses
which
was
my
husband
ideal
home
and
yet
i
do
not
remember
that
money
ever
dwelt
very
long
in
our
minds
we
learned
to
have
such
a
royal
time
on
so
little
there
was
something
that
always
came
before
the
kentucky
farm
with
its
thoroughbreds
if
ever
he
said
if
i
get
rich
i
tell
you
what
do
i
knew
as
well
before
he
spoke
just
what
was
to
follow
in
all
the
twelve
years
he
never
altered
the
first
plan
i
buy
a
home
for
father
and
mother
they
owned
their
home
in
monroe
then
but
it
was
not
good
enough
to
please
him
nothing
was
good
enough
for
his
mother
but
the
dear
woman
with
her
simple
tastes
would
have
felt
far
from
contented
in
the
sort
of
home
in
which
her
son
longed
to
place
her
all
she
asked
was
to
gather
her
boys
around
her
so
that
she
could
see
them
every
day
as
we
wandered
round
the
with
their
monstrosities
came
into
the
general
programme
and
the
prize
pigs
were
never
neglected
if
we
bent
over
the
pens
to
see
the
huge
things
rolling
in
lazy
contentment
my
husband
went
back
to
his
farm
days
and
explained
what
taught
him
to
like
swine
in
which
i
admit
i
could
not
be
especially
interested
his
father
had
given
each
son
a
pig
with
the
promise
exacted
in
return
that
they
should
be
daily
washed
and
combed
when
the
general
described
the
pink
and
white
collection
of
pets
that
his
father
distributed
among
his
sons
swine
were
no
longer
swine
to
me
they
were
curled
darlings
as
he
pictured
them
and
now
i
recall
that
long
after
he
showed
such
true
appreciation
of
his
friend
stock
on
one
of
the
farms
in
kentucky
where
we
visited
two
pigs
of
royal
birth
whose
ancestors
dated
back
many
generations
were
given
to
us
and
we
sent
them
home
to
our
farmer
brother
to
keep
until
we
should
possess
a
place
of
our
own
which
was
one
of
the
mild
indulgences
of
our
imagination
and
which
we
hoped
would
be
the
diversion
of
our
old
age
i
think
it
rather
strange
that
my
husband
looked
so
fearlessly
into
the
future
i
hardly
know
how
one
so
active
could
so
calmly
contemplate
the
days
when
his
steps
would
be
slow
we
never
passed
on
the
street
an
old
man
with
gray
curls
lying
over
his
but
the
general
slackened
his
steps
to
say
in
a
whisper
there
libbie
that
me
forty
years
from
now
and
if
there
happened
to
be
john
anderson
obese
old
wife
by
him
toddling
painfully
along
red
and
out
of
breath
he
teasingly
added
and
that
what
you
would
to
be
it
was
a
source
of
argument
that
i
would
be
much
more
successful
in
the
way
of
looks
if
i
were
not
so
slender
and
as
my
husband
even
when
a
lad
liked
women
who
were
slenderly
formed
he
loved
to
torment
me
by
pointing
out
to
what
awful
proportions
a
woman
weighing
what
was
to
me
a
requisite
number
of
pounds
sometimes
arrived
in
old
age
a
tournament
was
given
in
the
great
amphitheatre
of
the
fair
building
in
louis
which
was
simply
delightful
to
us
the
horsemanship
so
pleased
my
husband
that
he
longed
to
bound
down
into
the
arena
take
a
horse
and
tilt
with
their
long
lances
at
the
rings
some
of
the
confederate
officers
rode
for
the
prizes
and
their
knights
costume
and
good
horses
were
objects
of
momentary
envy
as
they
recalled
the
riding
academy
exercises
at
west
point
finally
the
pretty
ceremony
of
crowning
the
queen
of
love
and
beauty
by
the
successful
knight
ended
a
real
gala
day
to
us
at
night
a
ball
at
the
hotel
gave
us
an
opportunity
to
be
introduced
to
the
beautiful
woman
who
sat
on
a
temporary
throne
in
the
and
we
thought
her
well
worth
tilting
lances
for
and
that
nothing
could
encourage
good
horsemanship
like
giving
as
a
prize
the
temporary
possession
of
a
pretty
girl
while
in
louis
we
heard
lawrence
barrett
for
the
first
time
he
was
of
nearly
the
same
age
as
my
husband
and
after
three
soldiering
in
our
war
as
a
captain
in
the
massachusetts
infantry
had
returned
to
his
profession
full
of
ambition
and
the
sort
of
go
that
called
out
instant
recognition
from
the
general
barrett
in
recalling
lately
the
first
time
he
met
general
custer
spoke
of
the
embarrassing
predicament
in
which
he
was
placed
by
the
impetuous
determination
of
one
whom
from
that
hour
he
cherished
as
his
warmest
friend
he
was
playing
rosedale
and
my
husband
was
charmed
with
his
rendering
of
the
hero
part
he
recalled
for
years
the
delicate
manner
with
which
the
lover
allows
his
wounded
hand
to
be
bound
and
the
subtle
cunning
with
which
he
keeps
the
fair
minister
of
his
hurts
winding
and
unwinding
the
bandages
then
barrett
sang
a
song
in
the
play
which
the
general
hummed
for
years
afterward
i
remember
his
going
into
the
subject
whenever
we
met
even
when
barrett
was
justifiably
glowing
with
pride
over
his
success
in
the
legitimate
drama
and
interrupting
him
to
ask
why
he
no
longer
played
rosedale
the
invariable
answer
that
the
play
required
extreme
youth
in
the
hero
had
no
sort
of
power
to
stop
the
continued
demand
for
his
favorite
melodrama
after
we
had
seen
the
play
it
was
then
acted
for
the
first
time
the
general
begged
me
to
wait
in
the
lobby
until
he
had
sought
out
barrett
to
thank
him
and
on
our
return
from
the
theatre
we
lay
in
wait
knowing
that
he
stopped
at
our
hotel
as
he
was
going
quietly
to
his
room
reserved
even
then
boy
that
he
was
with
not
a
trace
of
the
impetuous
ardent
lover
he
had
so
lately
represented
before
the
off
raced
the
general
up
the
stairs
two
steps
at
a
time
to
capture
him
he
demurred
saying
his
rough
traveling
suit
of
gray
was
hardly
presentable
in
a
but
the
general
persisted
saying
the
old
lady
told
me
i
must
seize
you
and
go
you
must
for
i
do
propose
to
return
without
fulfilling
her
orders
barrett
submitted
and
was
presented
to
our
party
who
had
accompanied
us
on
the
special
car
to
louis
the
gray
clothes
were
forgotten
in
a
moment
in
the
reception
we
gave
him
but
music
came
out
from
the
and
all
rose
to
go
as
barrett
supposed
to
our
rooms
the
general
took
a
lady
on
his
arm
i
at
my
husband
suggestion
put
my
hand
on
barrett
arm
and
before
he
had
realized
it
he
was
being
marched
into
the
brilliantly
lighted
ballroom
and
bowing
from
force
of
capture
before
the
dais
on
which
sat
the
queen
of
love
and
beauty
all
this
delighted
the
general
unconventional
himself
he
nothing
heeded
the
chagrin
of
barrett
over
his
inappropriate
garb
and
chuckled
like
a
schoolboy
over
his
successful
raid
i
think
barrett
was
not
released
until
he
pleaded
the
necessity
for
time
to
work
he
was
then
reading
and
studying
far
into
the
night
to
make
up
for
the
lapse
in
his
profession
that
his
army
life
had
caused
he
was
not
so
absorbed
in
his
literary
pursuits
however
that
he
did
not
take
in
the
charm
of
those
beautiful
louis
girls
and
we
three
in
many
a
jolly
evening
since
have
gone
back
to
the
beauty
of
the
bewitching
belles
as
they
floated
by
us
in
that
ballroom
or
paused
to
capture
the
new
on
their
already
crowded
field
barrett
even
remembers
that
the
queen
of
love
and
beauty
vouchsafed
him
the
eighth
of
a
dance
for
her
royal
highness
dispensed
favors
by
piecemeal
to
the
waiting
throng
about
her
throne
our
roving
life
brought
us
in
contact
with
actors
frequently
if
the
general
found
that
barrett
was
to
play
in
any
accessible
city
he
hurried
me
into
my
flung
his
own
and
my
best
bonnet
in
a
crumpled
mass
into
a
little
trunk
and
off
we
started
in
pursuit
it
is
hard
to
speak
fittingly
of
the
meeting
of
those
two
men
they
joyed
in
each
other
as
women
do
and
i
tried
not
to
look
when
they
met
or
parted
while
they
gazed
with
tears
into
each
other
eyes
and
held
hands
like
exuberant
girls
each
kept
track
of
the
movements
through
the
papers
and
rejoiced
at
every
success
while
barrett
with
the
voice
my
husband
thought
perfect
in
intonation
and
expression
always
called
to
him
the
moment
they
met
well
old
fellow
hard
at
work
making
history
are
you
a
few
evenings
since
i
chanced
to
see
barrett
dresser
the
irish
garry
who
had
charge
of
his
costumes
in
those
days
when
the
general
used
to
haunt
the
in
the
last
winter
we
were
together
in
new
york
as
he
entered
the
room
in
armor
and
found
his
old
man
custer
waiting
for
him
garry
tells
me
that
my
husband
leaped
toward
the
mailed
and
helmeted
soldier
and
gave
him
some
rousing
bangs
on
the
corseleted
chest
for
they
sparred
like
boys
barrett
parrying
the
thrust
said
custer
old
man
you
ought
to
have
one
of
these
suits
of
armor
for
your
work
ye
gods
no
said
the
general
in
mimic
alarm
with
that
glistening
as
a
target
every
arrow
would
be
directed
at
me
i
rather
go
naked
than
in
that
illustration
kansas
in
and
kansas
in
there
were
three
hundred
miles
of
railroad
in
six
thousand

chapter

westward
ho
fighting

in
the
seventh
cavalry
general
custer
temptations
the
junketing
and
frolic
at
louis
came
to
an
end
in
a
few
days
and
our
faces
were
again
turned
westward
to
a
life
about
as
different
from
the
glitter
and
show
of
a
gay
city
in
a
holiday
week
as
can
be
imagined
leavenworth
was
our
first
halt
and
its
streets
and
excellent
stores
surprised
us
it
had
long
been
the
outfitting
place
for
our
officers
the
soldiers
drew
supplies
from
the
military
post
and
the
officers
furnished
themselves
with
camp
equipage
from
the
city
here
also
they
bought
condemned
ambulances
and
put
them
in
order
for
for
their
families
i
remember
getting
a
faint
glimmer
of
the
climate
we
were
about
to
endure
by
seeing
a
wagon
floored
and
its
sides
lined
with
canvas
which
was
stuffed
to
keep
out
the
cold
while
a
little
stove
was
firmly
fixed
at
one
end
with
a
bit
of
miniature
pipe
protruding
through
the
roof
the
journey
from
fort
leavenworth
to
santa
fé
new
mexico
then
took
six
weeks
everything
was
transported
in
the
great
army
wagons
called
these
were
well
named
as
the
two
ends
of
the
wagon
inclined
upward
like
the
bow
and
stern
of
a
it
is
hard
to
realize
how
strangely
a
long
train
of
supplies
for
one
of
the
distant
posts
looked
as
it
wound
slowly
over
the
plains
the
blue
with
white
canvas
covers
rising
up
ever
so
high
disclosed
in
the
small
circle
where
they
were
drawn
together
at
the
back
all
kinds
of
material
for
the
clothing
and
feeding
of
the
army
in
the
distant
territories
the
number
of
mules
to
a
wagon
varies
sometimes
there
are
four
and
again
six
the
driver
rides
the
mule
he
holds
in
his
hand
a
broad
piece
of
leather
an
inch
and
a
half
in
width
which
divides
over
the
shoulders
of
the
lead
or
pilot
mule
and
fastens
to
the
bit
on
either
side
of
his
mouth
the
leaders
are
widely
separated
a
small
hickory
stick
about
five
feet
long
called
the
not
unlike
a
is
stretched
between
a
pilot
and
his
mate
this
has
a
little
chain
at
either
end
and
is
attached
by
a
snap
or
hook
to
the
bit
of
the
other
leader
when
the
driver
gives
one
pull
on
the
heavy
strap
the
pilot
mule
veers
to
the
left
and
pulls
his
mate
two
quick
sudden
jerks
mean
to
the
right
and
he
responds
and
pushes
his
companion
accordingly
and
in
this
simple
manner
the
ponderous
vehicle
and
all
the
six
animals
are
guided
the
most
spirited
mules
are
selected
from
the
train
for
leaders
they
can
not
be
reached
by
the
whip
and
the
driver
must
rely
upon
the
emphasis
he
puts
into
his
voice
to
incite
them
to
effort
they
know
their
names
and
i
have
seen
them
respond
to
a
call
even
when
not
accompanied
by
the
expletives
that
seem
to
be
composed
especially
for
this
branch
of
charioteering
the
driver
of
our
mules
naturally
suppressed
his
invectives
in
my
presence
the
most
profane
soldier
holds
his
tongue
in
a
vise
when
he
is
in
the
presence
of
a
woman
but
he
is
sorely
put
to
it
to
find
a
substitute
for
the
only
language
he
considers
a
mule
will
heed
i
have
seen
our
driver
shake
his
head
and
move
his
jaws
in
an
ominous
manner
when
the
provoking
leaders
took
a
skittish
leap
on
one
side
of
the
trail
or
turned
round
and
faced
him
with
a
protest
against
further
progress
they
were
sometimes
so
afraid
of
buffalo
and
always
of
indians
they
became
rebellious
to
such
a
degree
he
was
at
his
wits
end
to
get
any
further
go
out
of
them
it
was
in
vain
he
called
out
you
bet
there
what
are
you
about
sal
he
plainly
showed
and
said
that
he
found
such
work
worth
a
rap
with
them
vicious
creeturs
the
driver
if
he
is
not
a
stolid
mexican
takes
much
pride
in
his
mules
by
some
unknown
means
poor
as
he
is
he
possesses
himself
of
fox
or
small
coyote
tails
which
he
fastens
to
their
bridle
and
the
vagaries
in
the
clipping
of
the
poor
beasts
tails
would
set
the
fashion
to
a
paris
they
are
shaved
a
certain
distance
and
then
a
tuft
is
left
making
a
bushy
ring
this
is
done
twice
if
bet
or
sal
is
vouchsafed
an
appendage
long
enough
to
admit
of
it
while
the
tuft
on
the
end
though
of
little
use
to
intimidate
flies
is
a
marvel
of
the
coats
of
the
beasts
so
valued
sometimes
shine
like
the
fine
hair
of
a
good
horse
alas
not
when
in
the
final
stages
of
a
long
march
the
jaded
beasts
dragged
themselves
over
the
trail
driver
and
lead
mules
even
lose
ambition
under
the
scorching
sun
and
with
the
insufficient
food
and
long
water
famines
the
old
reliability
of
a
is
the
it
is
his
leathery
sides
that
can
be
most
readily
reached
by
the
whip
called
a
and
when
the
descent
is
made
into
a
stream
with
muddy
bed
the
cut
is
given
to
this
faithful
beast
and
on
his
powerful
muscles
depends
the
wrench
that
jerks
the
old
schooner
out
of
a
slough
the
nigh
or
saddle
mule
does
his
part
in
such
an
emergency
but
he
soon
reasons
that
because
he
carries

driver
not
much
more
is
expected
of
him
illustration
conestoga
wagon
or
the
general
and
i
took
great
interest
in
the
names
given
to
the
animals
that
pulled
our
or
hauled
the
supplies
as
we
rode
by
the
voice
of
the
driver
bringing
out
the
name
he
had
chosen
and
sometimes
affectionately
made
us
sure
that
the
woman
for
whom
the
beast
was
christened
was
the
sweetheart
of
the
apparently
prosaic
teamster
i
was
avowedly
romantic
and
the
general
was
equally
so
though
after
the
fashion
of
men
he
did
not
proclaim
it
our
place
at
the
head
of
the
column
was
sometimes
vacant
either
because
we
were
delayed
for
our
luncheon
or
because
my
husband
remained
behind
to
help
the
quartermaster
or
the
head
teamster
get
the
train
over
a
stream
it
was
then
that
we
had
the
advantage
of
hearing
the
names
conferred
on
the
mules
they
took
in
a
wide
range
of
female
nomenclature
and
we
found
it
great
fun
to
watch
the
family
life
of
one
human
being
and
his
six
beasts
my
husband
had
the
utmost
respect
for
a
mule
sense
when
i
looked
upon
them
as
dull
animals
he
bade
me
watch
how
deceitful
were
appearances
as
they
showed
such
cunning
and
evinced
the
wisdom
of
a
thoroughbred
when
apparently
they
were
unobserving
sleepy
brutes
it
was
the
general
who
made
me
notice
the
skill
and
rapidity
with
which
a
group
of
six
mules
would
straighten
out
what
seemed
to
be
a
hopeless
tangle
of
chains
and
harness
into
which
they
had
kicked
themselves
when
there
was
a
disturbance
among
them
one
crack
of
the
whip
from
the
driver
who
had
tethered
them
after
a
march
accompanied
by
a
plain
statement
of
his
opinion
of
such
fools
would
send
the
whole
collection
wide
apart
and
it
was
but
a
twinkling
before
they
extricated
themselves
from
what
i
thought
a
hopeless
mess
no
chains
or
straps
were
broken
and
a
meek
subdued
look
pervading
the
group
left
not
a
trace
of
the
active
heels
that
a
moment
before
had
filled
the
air
there
the
general
used
to
say
do
ever
flatter
yourself
again
that
a
mule
has
sense
he
got
more
wisdom
than
half
the
horses
in
the
line
it
took
a
good
while
to
convince
me
as
a
more
animal
can
hardly
be
found
than
the
army
mule
which
never
in
his
existence
is
expected
to
go
off
from
a
walk
or
to
vary
his
life
from
the
day
he
is
first
harnessed
until
he
drops
by
the
way
old
or
exhausted
at
the
time
we
were
first
on
the
plains
many
of
the
teamsters
were
mexicans
short
swarthy
dull
and
hardly
a
grade
above
the
animal
the
only
ambition
of
these
creatures
seemed
to
be
to
vie
with
one
another
as
to
who
could
snap
the
huge
the
loudest
they
learned
to
whisk
the
thong
at
the
end
around
the
ears
of
a
shirking
off
leader
and
crack
the
lash
with
such
an
explosive
sound
that
i
never
got
over
jumping
in
my
whole
plains
life
i
am
sorry
to
say
my
horse
usually
responded
with
a
spring
that
sent
me
into
thin
air
anywhere
between
his
ears
and
his
tail
with
a
good
deal
of
uncertainty
as
to
where
i
should
alight
i
suspect
it
was
an
innocent
little
amusement
of
the
drivers
when
occasionally
we
remained
behind
at
nooning
and
had
to
ride
swiftly
by
the
long
train
to
reach
the
head
of
the
column
the
disappeared
with
the
advancing
railroad
but
i
am
glad
to
see
that
general
meigs
has
perpetuated
its
memory
by
causing
this
old
means
of
transportation
to
be
made
one
of
the
designs
in
the
beautiful
frieze
carved
around
the
outside
of
the
pension
office
at
washington
ungainly
and
cumbersome
as
these
wagons
were
they
merit
some
such
monument
as
part
of
the
history
of
the
early
days
of
frontier
life
in
our
country
we
were
in
the
west
several
years
before
the
railroad
was
completed
to
denver
and
the
overland
trains
became
an
sight
to
us
citizens
used
oxen
a
great
deal
for
transportation
and
there
is
no
picture
that
represents
the
weariness
and
laggard
progress
of
life
like
an
bound
for
santa
fé
or
denver
the
might
set
out
freshly
painted
or
perhaps
washed
in
a
creek
but
it
soon
became
gray
with
layer
upon
layer
of
alkali
dust
the
oxen
well
nothing
save
a
snail
can
move
more
slowly
and
the
exhaustion
of
these
beasts
after
weeks
of
uninterrupted
travel
was
pitiful
imagine
also
the
unending
vigil
when
the
trains
were
insecurely
guarded
for
in
those
days
there
was
an
immense
unprotected
frontier
and
seemingly
only
a
handful
of
cavalry
the
regiments
looked
well
on
the
roster
but
there
were
in
reality
but
few
men
a
regiment
should
number
twelve
hundred
enlisted
men
but
at
no
time
unless
during
the
war
does
the
recruiting
officer
attempt
to
fill
it
to
the
maximum
seventy
men
to
a
company
is
a
large
number
the
desertions
during
the
first
years
of
the
reorganization
of
the
army
after
the
war
thinned
the
ranks
constantly
recruits
could
not
be
sent
out
fast
enough
to
fill
up
the
companies
the
consequence
was
that
all
those
many
hundred
miles
of
trail
where
the
government
undertook
to
protect
citizens
who
carried
supplies
to
settlements
and
the
mines
as
well
as
its
own
trains
of
material
for
building
new
posts
and
commissary
and
stores
for
troops
were
terribly
exposed
and
very
poorly
protected
the
indians
were
unfortunately
located
on
the
great
highway
of
western
travel
and
commerce
not
less
than
emigration
demanded
their
removal
there
are
many
conflicting
opinions
as
to
the
course
pursued
to
clear
the
way
but
i
only
wish
to
speak
now
of
the
impression
the
trains
made
upon
me
as
we
constantly
saw
the
long
dusty
column
wending
its
serpentine
way
over
the
earth
a
group
of
cavalry
with
their
drooping
horses
rode
in
front
and
at
the
rear
the
was
usually
the
very
quintessence
of
valor
it
is
true
he
formed
such
a
habit
of
shooting
that
he
grew
indiscriminate
and
should
any
of
the
lawless
desperadoes
whom
he
hired
as
teamsters
or
trainmen
ruffle
his
blood
kept
up
to
by
suspense
physical
exposure
and
exasperating
employees
he
knew
no
way
of
settling
troubles
except
the
effectual
quietus
that
a
bullet
secures
i
well
remember
my
husband
and
tom
who
dearly
loved
to
raise
my
indignation
and
create
signs
of
horror
and
detestation
at
their
tales
walking
me
down
to
the
government
train
to
see
a
who
had
shot
five
men
he
had
emigrated
from
the
spot
where
he
bade
fair
to
establish
a
private
cemetery
with
his
victims
no
one
needed
a
reason
for
his
sudden
appearance
after
the
number
of
his
slain
was
known
and
yet
no
questions
were
put
as
to
his
past
he
made
a
capital
he
was
obedient
to
his
superiors
faithful
and
on
time
every
morning
and
the
prestige
of
his
past
record
answered
so
well
with
the
citizen
employees
that
his
pistol
remained
unused
in
the
holster
it
seemed
to
be
expected
that
the
would
be
a
villain
whatever
was
their
record
as
to
the
manner
of
arranging
private
disputes
a
braver
class
of
men
never
followed
a
trail
and
some
of
them
were
far
superior
to
their
chance
lot
their
tender
care
of
women
who
crossed
in
these
to
join
their
husbands
ought
to
be
commemorated
i
have
somewhere
read
one
of
their
remarks
when
a
girl
going
to
her
mother
had
been
secreted
in
a
private
wagon
and
there
was
no
knowledge
of
her
presence
until
the
indians
were
discovered
to
be
near
tai
no
time
to
be
teamin
women
folks
over
the
trail
with
sech
a
fearsom
sperit
for
injuns
as
i
be
he
like
some
of
the
bravest
men
i
have
known
spoke
of
himself
as
timid
while
he
knew
no
fear
it
certainly
unnerved
the
most
valiant
man
when
indians
were
lurking
near
to
realize
the
fate
that
hung
over
women
entrusted
to
their
care
in
a
later
portion
of
my
story
occurs
an
instance
of
an
officer
hiding
the
woman
whose
husband
had
asked
him
to
take
her
into
the
states
even
before
firing
a
shot
at
the
adversary
as
he
knew
with
what
redoubled
ferocity
the
savage
would
fight
at
sight
of
the
white
face
of
a
woman
it
makes
the
heart
beat
even
to
look
at
a
picture
of
the
old
mode
of
traversing
the
highway
of
western
travel
the
sight
of
the
pictured
train
seemingly
so
peacefully
lumbering
on
its
sleepy
way
the
scarcely
revolving
wheels
creaking
out
a
protest
against
even
that
effort
recalls
the
agony
the
suspense
the
horror
with
which
every
inch
of
that
long
route
has
been
made
the
heaps
of
stones
by
the
wayside
or
the
buffalo
bones
collected
to
mark
the
spot
where
some
man
fell
from
an
indian
arrow
are
now
disappearing
the
hurricanes
beating
upon
the
hastily
prepared
memorials
have
scattered
the
bleached
bones
of
the
bison
and
rolled
into
the
tufted
grass
the
few
stones
with
which
the
at
risk
of
their
own
lives
have
delayed
long
enough
to
mark
their
comrade
grave
the
faded
photographs
or
the
old
prints
of
those
overland
trains
speak
to
me
but
one
story
instantly
i
recall
the
hourly
vigilance
the
restless
eyes
scanning
the
horizon
the
breathless
suspense
when
the
pioneers
or
soldiers
knew
from
unmistakable
signs
that
the
indian
was
lying
in
wait
in
what
contrast
to
the
dull
logy
scarcely
moving
oxen
were
these
heroes
with
every
nerve
strained
every
sense
on
the
alert
and
how
they
were
maddened
by
the
fate
that
consigned
them
at
such
moments
to
the
mercy
of
dull
driven
cattle
when
i
have
seen
officers
and
soldiers
lay
their
hands
lovingly
on
the
neck
of
their
favorite
horse
and
perhaps
when
no
one
was
near
to
scoff
at
sentiment
say
to
me
he
saved
my
life
i
knew
well
what
a
man
felt
when
his
horse
took
fire
at
knowledge
of
danger
to
his
rider
and
sped
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
till
he
was
lost
to
his
pursuers
a
tiny
black
speck
on
the
horizon
the
pathos
of
a
soldier
parting
with
his
horse
moved
us
to
quick
sympathy
it
often
happens
that
a
trooper
retains
the
same
animal
through
his
entire
enlistment
and
it
comes
to
be
his
most
intimate
friend
there
is
nothing
he
will
not
do
to
provide
him
with
food
if
the
forage
runs
low
or
the
grazing
is
insufficient
stealing
for
his
horse
is
reckoned
a
virtue
among
soldiers
imagine
then
the
anxiety
the
real
suffering
with
which
a
soldier
watches
his
faithful
beast
growing
weaker
day
by
day
from
exhaustion
or
partial
starvation
he
walks
beside
him
to
spare
his
strength
and
finally
when
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
keep
up
with
the
column
and
the
soldier
knows
how
fatal
the
least
delay
may
be
in
an
indian
country
it
is
more
pitiful
than
almost
any
sight
i
recall
the
sadness
of
his
departure
from
the
skeleton
whose
eyes
follow
his
master
in
wondering
affection
as
he
walks
away
with
the
saddle
and
accoutrements
it
is
the
most
merciful
farewell
if
a
bullet
is
lodged
in
the
brain
of
the
famished
or
exhausted
beast
but
some
one
else
than
his
sorrowing
master
has
to
do
the
trying
deed
this
is
not
the
last
act
in
the
harrowing
scene
the
soldier
overtakes
the
column
loaded
down
with
his
saddle
if
the
train
is
too
far
away
to
deposit
it
in
the
company
wagon
then
begins
a
tirade
of
annoying
comments
to
this
man
still
grieving
over
the
parting
with
his
best
friend
no
one
can
conceive
what
sarcasm
and
wit
can
proceed
from
a
column
of
cavalry
many
of
the
men
are
irish
and
their
reputation
for
humor
is
hullo
there
joined
the
eh
how
do
you
like
hoofing
it
are
tame
specimens
of
the
remarks
from
these
tormenting
tongues
such
a
fusillade
of
sneers
is
followed
not
long
after
by
perhaps
the
one
most
gibing
of
all
flinging
himself
off
from
his
horse
and
giving
his
mount
to
the
one
he
has
done
his
best
to
stir
into
wrath
a
cavalryman
hates
beyond
any
telling
enforced
pedestrianism
and
share
and
share
alike
is
a
motto
that
our
western
soldiers
keep
in
use
if
the
wagons
held
merchandise
only
by
which
the
pioneer
hoped
to
grow
rich
the
risk
and
suspense
attending
these
endless
marches
were
not
worth
commemorating
but
the
bulk
of
the
freight
was
the
actual
necessities
of
life
conceive
if
you
can
how
these
brave
men
felt
themselves
chained
as
they
drove
or
guarded
the
food
for
those
living
far
in
advance
there
were
not
enough
to
admit
of
a
charge
on
the
enemy
and
the
defensive
is
an
exasperating
position
for
a
soldier
or
frontiersman
he
longs
to
advance
on
the
foe
but
no
such
privilege
was
allowed
them
for
in
these
toilsome
journeys
they
had
often
to
use
precautions
to
hide
themselves
if
indians
were
discovered
to
be
roaming
near
the
camp
was
established
trains
corralled
animals
secured
inside
a
temporary
stockade
the
fires
for
coffee
were
forbidden
for
smoke
rises
like
a
funnel
and
hangs
out
an
instant
signal
in
that
clear
air
even
the
consoling
pipe
was
smoked
under
a
or
in
a
hollow
if
there
happened
to
be
a
depression
of
the
ground
few
words
were
spoken
the
loud
oaths
sank
into
low
mutterings
and
the
bray
of
a
hungry
mule
the
clank
of
or
the
stamping
of
cattle
on
the
baked
earth
sounded
like
thunder
in
the
ears
of
the
anxious
expectant
men
fortunately
our
journey
in
these
trains
was
not
at
once
forced
upon
us
at
leavenworth
the
kansas
pacific
railroad
projected
to
denver
was
built
within
ten
miles
of
fort
riley
and
it
was
to
be
the
future
duty
of
the
seventh
cavalry
to
guard
the
engineers
in
building
the
remainder
of
the
road
out
to
the
rocky
mountains
it
did
not
take
us
long
to
purchase
an
outfit
in
the
shops
for
as
usual
our
finances
were
low
and
consequently
our
wants
were
curtailed
we
had
the
sense
to
listen
to
a
hint
from
some
practical
officer
who
had
been
far
beyond
railroads
and
buy
a
the
first
thing
and
this
proved
to
be
the
most
important
of
our
possessions
when
we
reached
our
post
so
far
from
the
land
of
shops
not
many
hours
after
we
left
leavenworth
the
settlements
became
farther
and
farther
apart
and
we
began
to
realize
that
we
were
actual
pioneers
kansas
city
was
then
but
a
small
town
seemingly
with
a
hopeless
future
as
the
bluffs
rose
so
steeply
from
the
river
and
even
when
the
summit
was
reached
the
ups
and
downs
of
the
streets
were
discouraging
it
seemed
then
as
if
it
would
never
be
worth
while
to
use
it
as
a
site
for
a
town
there
would
be
a
lifetime
of
grading
it
is
very
easy
to
become
a
city
forefather
in
such
a
town
for
in
the
years
since
then
it
has
grown
into
a
city
of
over
inhabitants
but
they
are
still
grading
the
lots
which
we
could
have
had
almost
for
the
asking
sell
now
for
a
front
foot
topeka
the
capital
showed
no
evidence
of
its
importance
except
the
little
circle
of
stars
that
surrounded
it
on
our
atlas
there
were
but
three
towns
beyond
fort
riley
then
and
those
were
built
if
i
may
so
express
it
of
canvas
and
our
railroad
journey
came
to
an
end
about
ten
miles
from
fort
riley
the
laborers
were
laying
track
from
that
point
it
had
been
a
sort
of
gala
day
for
general
sherman
on
one
of
his
tours
of
inspection
of
the
frontier
posts
had
been
asked
by
railroad
officials
to
drive
the
final
spike
of
the
division
of
the
road
then
finished
we
found
a
wagon
waiting
for
our
luggage
and
an
ambulance
to
carry
us
the
rest
of
the
journey
these
vehicles
are
not
uncomfortable
when
the
long
seats
on
either
side
are
so
arranged
that
they
make
a
bed
for
the
ill
or
wounded
by
spreading
them
out
but
as
traveling
conveyances
i
could
not
call
them
a
success
the
seats
are
narrow
with
no
back
to
speak
of
and
covered
with
which
can
keep
you
occupied
if
the
country
is
rough
in
regaining
the
slippery
surface
for
any
number
of
miles
at
a
stretch
fort
riley
came
in
sight
when
we
were
pretty
well
tired
out
it
was
my
first
view
of
a
frontier
post
i
had
either
been
afraid
to
confess
my
ignorance
or
so
assured
there
was
but
one
variety
of
fort
and
the
subject
needed
no
investigation
that
fort
riley
came
upon
me
as
a
great
surprise
i
supposed
of
course
it
would
be
exactly
like
fortress
monroe
with
stone
walls
turrets
for
the
sentinels
and
a
deep
moat
as
i
had
heard
more
and
more
about
indians
since
reaching
kansas
a
vision
of
the
enclosure
where
we
would
eventually
live
was
a
great
comfort
to
me
i
could
scarcely
believe
that
the
buildings
a
story
and
a
half
high
placed
around
a
were
all
there
was
of
fort
riley
the
sutler
store
the
quartermaster
and
commissary
storehouses
and
the
stables
for
the
cavalry
horses
were
outside
the
square
near
the
post
and
that
was
all
no
trees
and
hardly
any
signs
of
vegetation
except
the
that
curled
its
sweet
blades
close
to
the
ground
as
if
to
protect
the
nourishment
it
held
from
the
blazing
sun
the
post
was
beautifully
situated
on
a
wide
plateau
at
the
junction
of
the
republican
and
smoky
hill
rivers
the
plains
as
they
waved
away
on
all
sides
of
us
like
the
surface
of
a
vast
ocean
had
the
charm
of
great
novelty
and
the
absence
of
trees
was
at
first
forgotten
in
the
fascination
of
seeing
such
an
immense
stretch
of
country
with
the
soft
undulations
of
green
turf
rolling
on
seemingly
to
the
setting
sun
the
eye
was
relieved
by
the
fringe
of
cottonwood
that
bordered
the
rivers
below
us
though
we
came
afterward
to
know
on
toilsome
marches
under
the
sweltering
sun
when
that
orb
was
sometimes
not
even
hidden
for
one
moment
in
the
day
by
a
grateful
cloud
but
the
sky
was
spread
over
as
a
vast
canopy
of
dazzling
blue
that
enthusiasm
would
not
outlast
such
trials
still
a
rarely
exultant
feeling
takes
possession
of
one
in
the
gallops
over
the
plains
when
in
early
spring
they
are
a
trackless
sea
of
soft
verdure
and
the
enthusiasm
returns
when
the
campaign
for
the
summer
is
over
and
riding
is
taken
up
for
pleasure
my
husband
was
full
of
delight
over
the
exquisite
haze
that
covered
the
land
with
a
faint
purple
light
and
exclaimed
now
i
begin
to
realize
what
all
that
transparent
veil
of
faint
color
means
in
bierstadt
paintings
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
west
but
we
had
little
time
to
take
in
atmospheric
effects
as
evening
was
coming
on
and
we
were
yet
to
be
housed
while
servants
horses
dogs
and
all
of
us
were
hungry
after
our
long
drive
the
general
halted
the
wagon
outside
the
post
and
left
us
to
go
and
report
to
the
commanding
officer
at
that
time
i
knew
nothing
of
the
hospitality
of
a
frontier
post
and
i
begged
to
remain
in
the
wagon
until
our
quarters
were
assigned
us
in
the
garrison
up
to
this
time
we
had
all
been
in
splendid
spirits
the
novelty
the
lovely
day
and
exhilarating
air
and
all
the
possibilities
of
a
future
with
a
house
of
our
own
or
rather
one
lent
to
us
by
uncle
sam
seemed
to
fill
up
a
delightful
cup
to
the
brim
we
sat
outside
the
post
so
long
at
least
it
seemed
so
to
us
and
grew
hungrier
and
thirstier
that
there
were
evident
signs
of
mutiny
the
truth
is
whenever
the
general
was
with
us
with
his
determination
of
thinking
that
nothing
could
exceed
his
surroundings
it
was
almost
impossible
to
look
upon
anything
except
in
the
light
that
he
did
he
gave
color
to
everything
with
his
hopeful
views
eliza
sat
on
the
seat
with
the
driver
and
both
muttered
occasional
hungry
words
but
our
diana
and
i
had
the
worst
of
it
we
had
bumped
over
the
country
sometimes
violently
jammed
against
the
framework
of
the
canvas
cover
and
most
of
the
time
sliding
off
from
the
slippery
cushions
upon
the
insulted
dogs
for
of
course
the
general
had
begged
a
place
for
two
of
them
he
had
kept
them
in
order
all
the
way
from
the
termination
of
the
railroad
but
now
that
he
was
absent
turk
and
byron
renewed
hostilities
and
in
the
narrow
space
they
scrambled
and
snarled
and
sprang
at
each
other
when
the
general
came
back
he
found
the
little
hands
of
our
girl
clenched
over
the
collar
of
byron
at
one
end
of
the
ambulance
while
turk
sat
on
my
lap
swelling
with
rage
because
my
fingers
were
twisted
in
the
chain
that
held
him
as
i
sat
at
the
door
shaking
with
terror
it
was
quick
work
to
jerk
the
burly
brute
out
of
the
door
and
end
our
troubles
for
the
time
but
the
general
after
quieting
our
panic
threw
us
into
a
new
one
by
saying
we
must
make
up
our
minds
to
be
the
guests
of
the
commanding
officer
tired
and
unaccustomed
to
what
afterward
became
comparatively
easy
we
were
driven
to
one
of
the
quarters
and
made
our
entrance
among
strangers
i
then
realized
for
the
first
time
that
we
had
reached
a
spot
where
the
comforts
of
life
could
not
be
had
for
love
or
money
it
is
a
strange
sensation
to
arrive
at
a
place
where
money
is
of
little
use
in
providing
shelter
and
here
we
were
beyond
even
the
commonest
railroad
hotel
gibbs
who
received
us
was
put
to
a
severe
test
that
night
already
a
room
in
her
small
house
had
been
prepared
for
general
sherman
who
had
arrived
earlier
in
the
day
and
now
there
were
five
of
us
bearing
down
upon
her
i
told
her
how
i
had
begged
to
be
allowed
to
go
into
quarters
even
though
there
were
no
preparations
not
even
a
fireplace
where
eliza
could
have
cooked
us
food
enough
over
the
coals
to
stay
hunger
but
she
assured
me
that
having
been
on
the
plains
before
the
war
she
was
quite
accustomed
to
a
state
of
affairs
where
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
quarter
yourself
upon
strangers
and
then
gave
up
her
own
room
to
our
use
from
that
night
which
was
a
real
trial
to
me
because
i
felt
so
keenly
the
trouble
we
caused
them
all
dates
the
beginning
of
a
friendship
that
has
lasted
through
the
darkest
as
well
as
the
brightest
hours
of
my
life
i
used
to
try
to
remember
afterward
when
for
nine
years
we
received
and
entertained
strangers
who
had
nowhere
else
to
go
the
example
of
undisturbed
hospitality
shown
me
by
my
first
friend
on
the
frontier
the
next
day
my
husband
assumed
command
of
the
garrison
and
our
few
effects
were
moved
into
a
large
double
house
built
for
the
commanding
officer
there
were
parlors
on
one
side
whose
huge
folding
doors
were
flung
open
and
made
our
few
articles
of
furniture
look
lonely
and
meagre
we
had
but
six
wooden
chairs
to
begin
with
and
when
a
few
miles
more
of
the
railroad
being
completed
a
party
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
excursionists
arrived
i
seated
six
of
them
yes
seven
for
one
was
tired
enough
to
sit
on
a
trunk
and
then
concluded
i
would
own
up
that
in
the
larger
rooms
of
the
house
into
which
they
looked
significantly
there
were
no
more
chairs
concealed
i
had
done
my
best
and
tried
to
make
up
for
not
seating
or
feeding
them
by
very
busy
talking
meanwhile
there
were
incessant
inquiries
for
the
general
it
seems
that
he
had
begun
that
little
trick
of
hiding
from
strangers
even
then
he
had
seen
the
advancing
column
of
tourists
and
fled
one
of
the
servants
finally
unearthed
him
and
after
they
had
gone
and
he
found
that
i
had
been
so
troubled
to
think
i
could
do
nothing
for
the
citizens
and
so
worried
because
he
was
he
did
not
leave
me
in
such
strait
again
until
i
had
learned
to
adapt
myself
to
the
customs
of
the
country
where
the
maxim
that
every
man
house
is
his
castle
is
a
fallacy
the
officers
who
had
garrisoned
the
post
began
to
move
out
as
our
own
seventh
cavalry
officers
reported
for
duty
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
arrived
and
ranked
us
out
of
our
quarters
in
this
instance
much
to
our
relief
as
the
barrack
of
a
building
would
never
fill
up
from
the
slow
rate
at
which
our
belongings
increased
this
army
regulation
to
which
i
have
elsewhere
referred
was
then
new
to
me
the
manner
in
which
the
government
sees
fit
to
arrange
quarters
is
still
amusing
to
me
but
i
suppose
no
better
plan
has
ever
been
thought
out
in
the
beginning
of
a
post
there
is
but
little
choice
it
is
the
aim
to
make
the
houses
except
that
of
the
commanding
officer
exactly
alike
from
time
to
time
new
quarters
are
built
the
original
plan
is
not
followed
possibly
a
few
improvements
are
added
to
the
newer
houses
ah
then
the
disturbance
ensues
fort
vancouver
in
washington
territory
is
one
of
the
old
posts
quite
interesting
from
the
heterogeneous
collection
of
quarters
added
through
fifty
years
i
was
spending
a
day
or
two
in
with
my
husband
niece
whose
husband
was
some
distance
down
on
the
list
and
consequently
occupied
a
low
log
building
that
dated
back
no
one
knows
how
far
even
in
that
little
cabin
they
were
insecure
for
in
reply
to
my
question
surely
you
are
permanently
fixed
and
wo
be
moved
they
pathetically
answered
not
by
any
means
we
live
from
hour
to
hour
in
uncertainty
and
there
are
worse
quarters
than
these
which
we
walk
by
daily
with
dread
as
ranks
us
and
he
is
going
to
be
married
so
out
we
go
assigning
quarters
according
to
rank
goes
on
smoothly
for
a
time
but
occasionally
an
officer
reports
for
duty
who
ranks
everyone
not
long
ago
this
happened
at
a
distant
post
and
the
whole
line
went
down
like
a
row
of
bricks
as
eight
officers
families
were
ousted
by
his
arrival
the
lowest
in
rank
having
to
move
out
one
of
the
officers
who
had
lived
in
a
little
cabin
with
two
rooms
if
possible
in
choosing
a
time
to
visit
our
frontier
posts
let
this
climax
of
affairs
be
avoided
where
there
is
little
to
vary
life
the
monotony
is
apt
to
be
deeply
stirred
by
private
rages
which
would
blow
away
in
smoke
if
there
was
anything
else
to
think
of
it
is
rather
harrowing
to
know
that
some
one
has
an
eye
on
the
home
you
have
furnished
with
your
own
means
i
could
hardly
blame
a
man
i
knew
who
in
an
outburst
of
wrath
concerning
an
officer
who
had
at
last
uprooted
him
secretly
rejoiced
that
a
small
room
that
had
been
the
object
of
envy
having
been
built
at
the
impoverished
post
of
refuse
lumber
from
the
stables
was
unendurable
on
a
warm
day
and
the
new
possessor
was
left
to
find
it
out
when
he
had
settled
himself
in
the
coveted
house
illustration
the
officer
dress
a
for
a
call
after
our
quarters
were
chosen
by
the
colonel
we
took
another
house
of
moderate
size
bought
a
few
pieces
of
furniture
of
an
officer
leaving
the
post
and
began
to
live
our
first
homelike
life
the
arrival
of
the
new
officers
was
for
a
time
our
only
excitement
most
of
them
had
been
in
the
volunteer
service
and
knew
nothing
of
the
regular
army
there
was
no
one
to
play
practical
jokes
on
the
first
comers
but
they
had
made
some
ridiculous
errors
in
dress
and
deportment
when
reporting
at
first
and
they
longed
to
take
out
their
mortification
at
these
harmless
mistakes
by
laying
pitfalls
for
the
verdant
ones
who
were
constantly
arriving
the
discipline
of
the
regular
army
and
the
punctilious
observance
compelling
the
wearing
of
the
uniform
was
something
totally
new
to
men
who
had
known
little
of
parades
in
their
fighting
days
in
the
tented
field
if
it
was
possible
to
intimidate
a
new
officer
by
tales
of
the
strictness
of
the
commanding
officer
regarding
the
personal
appearance
of
his
regiment
they
did
so
one
by
one
those
who
had
preceded
the
last
comer
called
in
to
pay
their
compliments
but
by
previous
agreement
they
one
and
all
dwelt
upon
the
necessity
of
his
making
a
careful
toilet
before
he
approached
the
august
presence
of
the
then
one
or
two
offered
carelessly
to
help
him
get
himself
up
for
the
occasion
our
brother
tom
had
arrived
by
this
time
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
made
out
of
him
for
he
had
served
a
few
months
with
a
regular
regiment
before
being
transferred
to
ours
he
was
therefore
sent
one
day
to
prepare
me
for
the
call
of
an
officer
who
had
been
assisted
into
his
new
uniform
by
the
mischievous
knot
of
men
who
had
been
longest
with
us
if
i
had
known
to
what
test
i
was
to
be
put
to
keep
my
face
straight
or
had
dreamed
what
a
gullible
creature
had
come
into
their
roguish
hands
i
would
not
have
consented
to
receive
him
but
it
was
one
of
the
imperative
roles
that
each
officer
after
reporting
for
duty
must
pay
a
formal
visit
to
the
commanding
officer
and
his
family
i
went
into
the
parlor
to
find
a
large
and
at
that
time
awkward
man
in
full
uniform
which
was
undeniably
a
tight
fit
for
his
rather
portly
figure
he
wore
cavalry
boots
the
first
singularity
i
noticed
for
they
had
such
expanse
of
top
i
could
not
help
seeing
them
they
are
of
course
out
of
order
with
a
dress
coat
the
red
sash
which
was
then
for
all
officers
was
spread
from
up
under
his
arms
to
as
far
below
the
waist
line
as
its
elastic
silk
could
be
stretched
the
with
sabre
attached
surrounded
this
and
folded
over
the
wide
red
front
were
his
large
hands
encased
in
white
cotton
gloves
he
never
moved
them
nor
did
he
move
an
eyelash
so
far
as
i
could
discover
though
it
seems
he
was
full
of
internal
tremors
for
the
officers
had
told
him
on
no
account
to
remove
his
regulation
hat
at
this
he
demurred
and
told
them
i
would
surely
think
he
was
no
gentleman
but
they
assured
him
i
placed
military
etiquette
far
above
any
ordinary
rule
for
manners
in
the
presence
of
ladies
while
the
truth
was
i
was
rather
indifferent
as
to
military
rules
of
dress
as
this
poor
man
sat
there
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
a
child
who
is
so
carefully
dressed
in
new
furbelows
that
it
sits
as
if
it
were
carved
out
of
wood
for
fear
of
disarranging
the
finished
toilet
diana
made
an
almost
instant
excuse
to
leave
the
room
the
general
mustache
quivered
and
he
moved
restlessly
around
even
coming
again
to
shake
hands
with
the
automaton
and
bid
him
welcome
to
the
regiment
but
finally
he
dashed
out
of
the
door
to
enjoy
the
outburst
of
mirth
that
he
could
no
longer
control
i
was
thus
left
to
meet
the
situation
as
best
i
could
but
was
not
as
fortunate
as
the
general
who
had
a
friendly
mustache
to
curtain
the
quiver
in
his
mouth
the
poor
victim
apparently
recalled
to
himself
the
martial
attitude
of
washington
crossing
the
delaware
or
napoleon
at
waterloo
and
did
not
alter
the
first
position
he
had
assumed
in
trying
to
prevent
him
from
seeing
my
confusion
i
redoubled
my
efforts
to
entertain
him
and
succeeded
only
too
well
for
when
he
slowly
moved
out
of
the
door
i
found
myself
tired
out
and
full
of
wrath
toward
my
returning
family
i
never
could
remember
that
these
little
spurts
of
rage
were
the
primest
fun
for
my
people
the
poor
officer
who
had
been
so
guyed
did
not
gratify
his
tormentors
by
getting
angry
but
fell
to
planning
new
mischief
for
the
next
arrival
he
lost
no
time
in
begging
my
pardon
for
the
hat
and
though
i
never
saw
much
of
him
afterward
he
left
only
pleasant
impressions
on
my
mind
of
a
man
and
one
of
those
rare
beings
who
knew
how
to
take
a
joke
we
derived
great
pleasure
from
our
horses
and
dogs
during
the
autumn
a
very
pretty
sorrel
horse
was
selected
for
diana
but
we
had
little
opportunity
to
have
her
for
a
companion
the
young
officers
engaged
her
a
week
in
advance
and
about
all
we
saw
of
her
riding
was
an
avalanche
of
flying
curls
as
she
galloped
off
beside
some
dashing
cavalier
i
remember
once
when
she
was
engaged
otherwise
and
my
horse
temporarily
disabled
i
took
hers
and
my
husband
kept
begging
me
to
guide
the
animal
better
for
it
was
nettling
his
fiery
beast
by
insisting
upon
too
close
proximity
it
finally
dawned
upon
us
that
the
little
horse
was
a
constitutional
snuggler
and
we
gave
up
trying
to
teach
him
new
tricks
but
how
the
general
shouted
and
bent
himself
forward
and
back
in
his
saddle
after
the
horse
had
almost
crushed
his
leg
and
nothing
would
keep
him
at
a
distance
he
could
hardly
wait
to
get
back
to
garrison
and
when
we
did
he
walked
into
the
midst
of
a
collection
of
the
beaux
and
told
the
whole
story
of
how
dreadfully
demoralized
a
cavalry
horse
in
good
and
regular
standing
could
become
in
the
hands
of
a
belle
the
girl
blushed
and
the
officers
joined
in
the
laughter
and
yet
every
one
of
them
had
doubtless
been
busy
in
teaching
that
little
telltale
animal
this
new
development
of
character
it
was
delightful
ground
to
ride
over
about
fort
riley
ah
what
happy
days
they
were
for
at
that
time
i
had
not
the
slightest
realization
of
what
indian
warfare
was
and
consequently
no
dread
we
knew
that
the
country
they
infested
was
many
miles
away
and
we
could
ride
in
any
direction
we
chose
the
dogs
would
be
aroused
from
the
deepest
sleep
at
the
very
sight
of
our
riding
costumes
and
by
the
time
we
were
well
into
them
and
whip
in
hand
they
leaped
and
sprang
about
the
room
tore
out
on
the
gallery
and
tumbled
over
one
another
and
the
furniture
in
racing
back
and
such
a
din
of
barking
and
joyful
whining
as
they
set
up
the
noisier
the
better
for
my
husband
he
snapped
his
whip
to
incite
them
and
bounded
around
crying
out
up
up
adding
to
the
mêlée
by
a
toot
on
the
he
had
brought
from
the
texas
all
this
excited
the
horses
and
when
i
was
tossed
into
the
saddle
amidst
this
turmoil
with
the
dogs
leaping
around
the
heads
i
hardly
knew
whether
i
was
myself
or
the
venturesome
young
woman
who
spends
her
life
in
taking
airy
flights
through
circles
in
a
sawdust
ring
it
took
some
years
for
me
to
accustom
myself
to
the
wild
din
and
hubbub
of
our
starting
for
a
ride
or
a
hunt
as
i
have
said
before
i
had
lived
quietly
at
home
and
my
decorous
suppressed
father
and
mother
never
even
spoke
above
a
certain
tone
the
general
father
on
the
contrary
had
rallied
his
sons
with
a
hallo
and
resounding
shouts
from
their
childhood
so
the
hullabaloo
of
all
our
merry
startings
was
a
thing
of
my
husband
early
days
and
added
zest
to
every
sport
he
undertook
coming
from
michigan
where
there
is
a
liberal
dispensation
of
swamp
and
quagmire
having
been
taught
by
dear
experience
that
virginia
had
quicksands
and
sloughs
into
which
one
could
disappear
with
great
rapidity
and
finally
having
experienced
texas
with
its
bayous
baked
with
a
deceiving
crust
of
mud
and
its
rivers
with
quicksand
beds
very
naturally
i
guided
my
horse
around
any
lands
that
had
even
a
depression
indeed
he
spoke
volumes
with
his
sensitive
ears
as
the
turf
darkened
in
hollows
and
was
ready
enough
to
be
guided
by
the
rein
on
his
neck
to
the
safer
ground
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
realized
that
all
the
plains
were
safe
we
chose
no
path
and
stopped
at
no
suspicion
of
a
slough
without
a
check
on
the
rein
we
flew
over
divide
after
divide
and
it
is
beyond
my
pen
to
describe
the
wild
sense
of
freedom
that
takes
possession
of
one
in
the
first
buoyant
knowledge
that
no
impediment
seemingly
lies
between
you
and
the
setting
sun
after
one
has
ridden
over
conventional
highways
the
beaten
path
marked
out
by
fences
hedges
bridges
it
is
simply
an
impossibility
to
describe
how
the
blood
bounds
in
the
veins
at
the
freedom
of
an
illimitable
sea
no
spongy
uncertain
ground
checks
the
course
over
the
plains
it
is
seldom
even
damp
and
the
air
is
so
exhilarating
one
feels
as
if
he
had
never
breathed
a
full
breath
before
almost
the
first
words
general
sherman
said
to
me
out
there
were
child
you
find
the
air
of
the
plains
is
like
champagne
and
so
it
surely
was
oh
the
joy
of
taking
in
air
without
a
taint
of
the
city
or
even
the
country
as
we
know
it
in
farm
life
as
we
rode
on
speaking
enthusiastically
of
the
fragrance
and
purity
of
the
atmosphere
our
horses
neighed
and
whinnied
to
each
other
and
snuffed
the
air
as
if
approving
all
that
was
said
of
that
land
of
the
free
my
husband
could
hardly
breathe
from
the
very
ecstasy
of
realizing
that
nothing
trammeled
him
he
scarcely
left
the
garrison
behind
him
where
he
was
bound
by
chains
of
form
and
ceremony
the
inevitable
lot
of
an
officer
where
all
his
acts
are
under
surveillance
where
he
is
obliged
to
know
that
every
hour
in
the
day
he
is
setting
an
example
before
he
became
the
wildest
and
most
frolicsome
of
boys
his
horse
and
he
were
one
not
only
as
he
sat
in
the
saddle
a
part
of
the
animal
swayed
by
every
motion
of
the
active
graceful
beast
but
such
unison
of
spirit
took
possession
of
each
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
a
human
heart
did
not
beat
under
the
broad
splendid
chest
of
the
animal
it
were
well
if
human
hearts
responded
to
our
fondness
and
came
instantly
to
be
with
us
as
did
those
dear
animals
when
they
flew
with
us
out
to
freedom
and
frolic
over
the
divides
that
screened
us
from
the
conventional
proprieties
my
husband
horse
had
almost
human
ways
of
talking
with
him
as
he
leaned
far
out
of
the
saddle
and
laid
his
face
on
the
gallant
animal
head
and
there
was
a
gleam
in
the
eye
a
proud
little
toss
of
the
head
speaking
back
a
whole
world
of
affection
the
general
could
ride
hanging
quite
out
of
sight
from
the
opposite
side
one
foot
caught
in
the
stirrup
his
hand
on
the
mane
and
it
made
no
difference
to
his
beloved
friend
he
took
any
mode
that
his
master
chose
to
cling
to
him
as
a
matter
of
course
and
curveted
and
pranced
in
the
loftiest
proudest
way
his
manner
said
as
plainly
as
speech
see
what
we
two
can
do
i
rarely
knew
him
to
have
a
horse
that
did
not
soon
become
so
pervaded
with
his
spirit
that
they
appeared
to
be
absolutely
one
in
feeling
i
was
obliged
usually
to
submit
to
some
bantering
slur
on
my
splendid
custis
lee
perhaps
a
dash
at
first
would
carry
the
general
and
the
dogs
somewhat
in
advance
my
side
had
a
trick
of
aching
if
we
started
off
on
a
gallop
and
i
was
obliged
to
keep
a
tight
rein
on
custis
lee
at
first
as
he
champed
at
the
bit
tossed
his
impatient
head
and
showed
every
sign
of
ignominious
shame
the
general
as
usual
called
out
come
on
old
lady
hurry
up
that
old
plug
of
yours
i
have
one
orderly
do
want
another
this
because
the
soldier
in
attendance
is
instructed
to
ride
at
a
certain
distance
in
the
rear
after
a
spurt
of
tremendous
speed
back
flew
the
master
to
beg
me
to
excuse
him
he
was
ready
now
to
ride
slowly
till
that
side
of
mine
came
round
to
time
which
it
quickly
did
and
then
i
revenged
the
insult
on
my
swift
lee
and
the
maligner
at
last
called
out
that
not
so
bad
a
nag
after
all
the
horses
bounded
from
the
springy
turf
as
if
they
really
hated
the
necessity
of
touching
the
sod
at
all
they
were
very
well
matched
in
speed
and
as
on
we
flew
were
neck
by
neck
stride
by
stride
never
changing
our
place
breathless
at
last
horses
dogs
and
ourselves
made
a
halt
the
orderly
with
his
slow
troop
horse
was
a
speck
in
the
distance
of
course
i
had
gone
to
pieces
little
by
little
between
the
mad
speed
and
rushing
through
the
wind
of
the
plains
those
were
ignominious
days
for
women
thank
fortune
they
are
over
custom
made
it
necessary
to
disfigure
ourselves
with
the
awkward
waterfall
and
no
matter
how
luxuriant
the
hair
it
seemed
a
necessity
to
still
pile
up
more
with
many
a
wrathful
opinion
regarding
the
fashion
the
general
took
the
hairpins
net
and
switch
and
thrust
them
into
the
breast
of
his
coat
as
he
said
to
clear
the
decks
for
action
for
another
race
it
was
enough
that
he
offered
to
carry
these
barbarities
of
civilization
for
me
without
my
bantering
him
about
his
ridiculousness
if
some
accidental
opening
of
his
coat
in
the
presence
of
the
officers
who
were
then
strangers
revealed
what
he
scoffingly
called
dead
women
hair
a
fresh
repinning
an
ignoring
of
hairpins
this
time
of
saddles
some
proud
patting
of
the
horses
quiving
flanks
passing
of
the
hand
over
the
full
veins
of
their
necks
praise
of
the
beautiful
distended
nostrils
and
on
we
started
for
another
race
if
spur
or
whip
had
been
used
in
speeding
our
horses
it
would
have
spoiled
the
sport
for
me
as
the
effort
and
strain
looks
so
cruelly
like
work
but
the
animals
were
as
impatient
for
a
run
as
we
were
to
start
them
it
must
be
a
rare
moment
of
pleasure
to
all
to
watch
an
animal
flying
over
the
ground
without
an
incentive
save
the
love
of
motion
born
in
the
beast
when
we
came
to
certain
smooth
stretches
on
the
road
where
we
were
accustomed
to
give
the
horses
the
rein
they
grew
excited
and
impatient
and
teased
for
the
run
if
we
chanced
to
be
earnestly
talking
and
forgot
to
take
it
how
fortunate
is
one
who
can
ride
a
mythological
pegasus
as
well
as
a
veritable
horse
there
is
nothing
left
for
the
less
gifted
but
to
use
others
words
for
our
own
enthusiasm
now
we
off
like
the
winds
to
the
plains
whence
they
came
and
the
rapture
of
motion
is
thrilling
my
frame
on
on
speeds
my
courser
scarce
printing
the
sod
scarce
crushing
a
daisy
to
mark
where
we
trod
on
on
like
a
deer
when
the
hounds
early
bay
awakes
the
wild
echoes
away
and
away
still
faster
still
farther
he
leaps
at
my
cheer
till
the
rush
of
the
startled
air
whirs
in
my
ear
buchanan
read
not
only
made
general
sheridan
splendid
black
horse
immortal
but
his
grateful
owner
kept
that
faithful
beast
when
it
was
disabled
in
a
paddock
at
leavenworth
and
then
when
age
and
old
wounds
ended
his
life
he
perpetuated
his
memory
by
having
the
taxidermist
set
him
up
in
the
military
museum
at
governor
island
that
the
boys
of
this
day
to
whom
the
war
is
only
history
may
remember
what
a
splendid
part
a
horse
took
in
those
days
when
soldiers
were
not
the
only
heroes
i
thank
a
poet
for
having
written
thus
for
us
to
whom
the
horse
is
almost
human
i
tell
thee
stranger
that
unto
me
the
plunge
of
a
fiery
steed
is
a
noble
thought
to
the
brave
and
free
it
is
music
and
breath
and
majesty
is
the
life
of
a
noble
deed
and
the
heart
and
the
mind
are
in
spirit
allied
in
the
charm
of
a
morning
glorious
ride
illustration
a
suspended
equestrienne
there
was
a
long
smooth
stretch
of
land
beyond
fort
riley
where
we
used
to
speed
our
horses
and
it
even
now
seems
one
of
the
fair
spots
of
earth
it
is
so
marked
by
happy
hours
in
reality
it
was
a
level
plain
without
a
tree
and
the
dried
had
then
scarcely
a
tinge
of
green
this
monotonous
surface
continued
for
many
unvarying
miles
we
could
do
as
we
chose
after
we
had
passed
out
of
sight
of
the
garrison
and
our
orderly
if
he
happened
to
have
a
decent
horse
that
could
overtake
us
kept
drawing
the
muscles
of
his
face
into
a
soldierly
expression
trying
not
to
be
so
undignified
as
to
laugh
at
the
gamesomeness
the
frolic
of
his
commanding
officer
what
a
relief
for
the
poor
fellow
in
his
uneventful
life
to
get
a
look
at
these
pranks
i
can
see
him
now
trying
to
keep
his
head
away
and
look
unconscious
but
his
eyes
turned
in
their
sockets
in
spite
of
him
and
caught
it
all
those
eyes
were
wild
with
terror
one
day
when
our
horses
were
going
full
tilt
and
the
general
with
one
powerful
arm
lifted
me
out
of
my
saddle
and
held
me
poised
in
the
air
for
a
moment
our
horses
were
so
evenly
matched
in
speed
they
were
neck
and
neck
keeping
close
to
each
other
seemingly
regardless
of
anything
except
the
delight
at
the
speed
with
which
they
left
the
country
behind
them
in
the
brief
moment
that
i
found
myself
suspended
between
heaven
and
earth
i
thought
with
lightning
rapidity
that
i
must
cling
to
my
bridle
and
keep
control
of
my
flying
horse
and
trust
to
good
fortune
whether
i
alighted
on
his
ear
or
his
tail
the
moment
i
was
thus
held
aloft
was
an
hour
in
uncertainty
but
nothing
happened
and
it
taught
me
to
prepare
for
sudden
raids
of
the
commanding
officer
after
that
i
read
of
this
feat
in
some
novel
but
was
incredulous
until
it
was
successfully
practiced
on
me
the
custer
men
were
given
to
what
their
maryland
father
called
toting
us
around
i
seen
them
pick
up
their
mother
and
carry
her
over
the
house
as
if
she
weighed
fifty
instead
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
there
was
no
chance
for
dignified
anger
with
them
no
matter
how
indignant
i
might
be
or
how
loftily
i
might
answer
back
or
try
one
of
those
eloquent
silences
to
which
we
women
sometimes
resort
in
moments
of
wrath
i
was
snatched
up
by
either
my
husband
or
tom
and
had
a
chance
to
commune
with
the
ceiling
in
my
airy
flight
up
and
down
stairs
and
through
the
rooms
one
of
our
rides
marked
a
day
with
me
for
it
was
the
occasion
of
a
very
successful
exchange
of
horses
my
husband
used
laughingly
to
refer
to
the
transaction
as
unfortunate
for
him
but
as
it
was
at
his
suggestion
i
clung
with
pertinacity
to
the
bargain
my
horse
custis
lee
being
a
pacer
my
husband
felt
in
the
fascination
of
that
smooth
swift
gait
i
might
be
so
wedded
to
it
i
could
never
endure
anything
else
so
he
suggested
while
we
were
far
out
on
our
evening
ride
that
we
change
saddles
and
try
each
other
horse
i
objected
for
though
i
could
ride
a
spirited
horse
when
i
had
come
to
know
him
i
dreaded
the
early
stages
of
acquaintance
besides
phil
was
a
colt
and
it
was
a
venturesome
experiment
to
try
him
with
a
long
loaded
with
shot
knocking
about
his
legs
at
that
time
the
safe
fashion
of
short
habits
was
not
in
vogue
and
the
high
winds
of
kansas
left
no
alternative
to
loading
our
skirts
we
kept
opening
the
hem
and
inserting
the
little
as
long
as
we
lived
there
fortunately
for
me
i
was
persuaded
into
trying
the
colt
as
soon
as
he
broke
into
a
long
swinging
trot
i
was
so
enchanted
and
so
hilarious
with
the
motion
that
i
mentally
resolved
never
to
yield
the
honor
temporarily
conferred
upon
me
it
was
the
beginning
of
an
eternal
vigilance
for
my
husband
the
animal
was
so
so
quick
notwithstanding
he
was
so
large
that
he
sprang
from
one
side
of
the
road
to
the
other
on
all
fours
without
the
slightest
warning
after
i
had
checked
him
and
recovered
my
breath
we
looked
about
for
a
cause
for
this
fright
and
found
only
the
dark
earth
where
slight
moisture
had
remained
from
a
shower
in
order
to
get
the
smoothest
trotting
out
of
him
i
rode
with
a
snaffle
and
i
never
knew
the
general
eyes
to
be
off
him
for
more
than
an
instant
the
officers
protested
and
implored
my
husband
to
change
back
and
give
me
the
pacer
but
his
pride
was
up
and
he
enjoyed
seeing
the
animal
quivering
with
delight
at
doing
his
best
under
a
light
weight
and
he
had
genuine
love
for
the
brute
that
though
so
hard
to
manage
in
his
hands
responded
to
my
lightest
touch
or
to
my
voice
as
time
advanced
and
our
regiment
gained
better
and
better
horseflesh
it
was
a
favorite
scheme
to
pit
phil
against
we
all
started
out
a
gay
cavalcade
of
noisy
happy
people
and
the
stranger
was
given
the
post
of
honor
next
to
the
wife
of
the
commanding
officer
of
course
he
thought
nothing
of
this
as
he
had
been
at
the
right
of
the
hostess
at
dinner
the
other
officers
saw
him
take
his
place
as
if
it
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
but
in
reality
it
was
a
plot
phil
started
off
with
so
little
effort
that
our
visitor
thought
nothing
of
keeping
pace
for
a
while
and
then
he
began
to
use
his
spurs
as
my
colt
took
longer
and
longer
strides
there
was
triumph
in
the
faces
of
the
officers
and
a
gleam
of
delight
in
the
general
eye
then
came
the
perplexity
in
my
guest
face
at
a
trotter
outdoing
the
most
splendid
specimen
of
a
loping
horse
as
he
thought
a
little
glance
from
my
husband
which
incited
me
to
give
a
sign
and
a
low
word
or
two
that
only
phil
and
i
understood
and
off
we
flew
leaving
the
mystified
man
urging
his
nag
in
vain
it
was
not
quite
my
idea
of
hospitality
so
to
introduce
a
to
our
horses
speed
but
then
he
was
not
a
transient
guest
and
the
sooner
he
knew
all
our
tricks
and
our
manners
the
better
while
it
was
beyond
my
power
of
to
miss
seeing
the
proud
triumph
in
my
husband
eyes
as
he
rode
up
and
patted
the
colt
and
received
the
little
return
of
affection
from
the
knowing
beast
phil
went
on
improving
in
gait
and
swiftness
as
he
grew
in
years
and
i
once
had
the
courage
afterward
to
speed
him
on
the
government
at
fort
leavenworth
though
to
this
day
i
can
not
understand
how
i
got
up
to
concert
pitch
and
i
could
never
be
induced
to
try
such
an
experiment
again
i
suppose
i
often
made
as
good
time
trotting
beside
my
horse
but
to
go
alone
was
something
i
was
never
permitted
to
do
on
a
roadway
the
general
and
brother
tom
connived
to
get
this
bit
of
temporary
courage
out
of
me
by
an
offhand
conversation
as
we
rode
toward
the
track
regarding
what
phil
might
be
made
to
do
under
the
best
circumstances
which
i
knew
meant
the
a
light
weight
and
my
hand
which
the
general
had
trained
to
be
steady
i
tried
to
beg
off
and
suggest
either
one
of
them
for
the
trial
but
the
curb
which
they
were
obliged
to
use
as
phil
was
no
easy
brute
to
manage
with
them
made
him
break
his
gait
and
a
hundred
and
seventy
pounds
on
his
back
was
another
obstacle
to
speed
it
ended
in
my
being
teased
into
the
experiment
and
though
i
called
out
after
the
first
that
i
could
not
breathe
any
longer
the
air
rushed
into
my
lungs
so
rapidly
they
implored
and
urged
by
gesture
and
enthusiastic
praise
until
i
made
the
mile
they
had
believed
phil
equal
to
in
three
minutes
i
wish
i
could
describe
what
delight
my
husband
took
in
his
horse
life
what
hours
of
recreation
and
untiring
pleasure
he
got
out
of
our
companionship
with
jack
rucker
phil
and
custis
lee
on
that
day
we
three
and
our
orderly
were
alone
on
the
track
and
such
a
merry
noisy
three
as
we
were
the
general
with
his
in
hand
cheering
me
urging
the
horse
wildly
clapping
his
hands
and
hallooing
with
joy
as
the
animal
responded
to
his
expectation
coming
up
to
their
boasts
and
anticipations
was
just
a
little
episode
in
our
life
that
went
to
prove
what
a
rare
faculty
he
had
of
getting
much
out
of
little
and
of
how
persistently
the
boy
in
him
cropped
out
as
soon
as
an
opportunity
came
to
throw
care
aside
it
is
one
of
the
results
of
a
life
of
deprivation
that
pleasures
when
they
come
are
rarities
and
the
enjoyment
is
intensified
in
our
life
they
lasted
so
short
a
time
that
we
had
no
chance
to
learn
the
meaning
of
satiety
one
of
the
hardest
trials
in
our
first
winter
with
the
regiment
was
that
arising
from
the
constantly
developing
tendency
to
hard
drinking
some
who
came
to
us
had
held
up
for
a
time
but
they
were
not
restricted
in
the
volunteer
service
as
a
man
who
fought
well
was
forgiven
much
else
that
came
in
the
rare
intervals
of
peace
in
the
new
state
of
affairs
as
went
the
first
few
months
of
the
regiment
so
would
it
go
for
all
time
there
was
a
regiment
stationed
in
new
mexico
at
that
time
the
record
of
which
was
shameful
we
heard
of
its
career
by
every
overland
train
that
came
into
our
post
and
from
officers
who
went
out
on
duty
general
sherman
said
that
with
such
a
set
of
drunkards
the
regiment
officers
and
all
should
be
mustered
out
of
the
service
anything
then
rather
than
let
our
seventh
follow
such
a
course
but
i
must
not
leave
the
regiment
at
that
point
in
its
history
eventually
it
came
out
all
right
ably
officered
and
well
soldiered
but
it
was
the
terror
of
the
country
in
while
general
custer
steadily
fought
against
drunkenness
he
was
not
remorseless
or
unjust
i
could
cite
one
instance
after
another
to
prove
with
what
patience
he
strove
to
reclaim
some
who
were
i
fear
hopeless
when
they
joined
us
his
own
greatest
battles
were
not
fought
in
the
tented
field
his
most
glorious
combats
were
those
waged
in
daily
hourly
fights
on
a
more
hotly
contested
field
than
was
ever
known
in
common
warfare
the
truest
heroism
is
not
that
which
goes
out
supported
by
strong
battalions
and
reserve
artillery
it
is
when
a
warrior
for
the
right
enters
into
the
conflict
alone
and
dares
to
exercise
his
will
in
defiance
of
some
established
custom
in
which
lies
a
lurking
deadly
peril
or
sin
i
have
known
my
husband
to
almost
stand
alone
in
his
opinion
regarding
temperance
in
a
garrison
containing
enough
people
to
make
a
village
he
was
thoroughly
unostentatious
about
his
convictions
and
rarely
said
much
but
he
stood
to
his
fixed
purpose
purely
from
horror
of
the
results
of
drinking
i
would
not
imply
that
in
garrison
general
custer
was
the
only
man
invariably
temperate
there
were
some
on
pledge
some
temperate
because
they
paid
such
a
physical
penalty
by
actual
illness
that
they
could
not
drink
some
restrained
because
their
comrade
weak
in
his
own
might
swore
off
on
consideration
that
the
stronger
one
of
the
two
backed
him
up
some
god
bless
them
refused
because
the
woman
they
loved
grieved
and
was
afraid
of
even
one
friendly
glass
what
i
mean
is
that
the
general
custom
against
which
there
is
little
opposition
in
any
life
is
either
to
indulge
in
the
social
glass
or
look
leniently
upon
the
habit
without
preaching
or
parading
his
own
strength
in
having
overcome
the
habit
general
custer
stood
among
the
officers
and
men
as
firm
an
advocate
of
temperance
as
any
evangelist
whose
life
is
devoted
to
the
cause
i
scarcely
think
i
would
have
realized
the
constantly
recurring
temptations
of
my
husband
life
had
i
not
been
beside
him
when
he
fought
these
battles
the
pleasure
he
had
in
convivial
life
the
manner
in
which
men
and
women
urged
him
to
join
them
in
enjoyment
of
the
sparkling
wine
was
enough
to
have
swept
every
resolution
to
the
winds
sometimes
the
keen
blade
of
sarcasm
though
set
with
jewels
of
wit
and
apparent
badinage
added
a
cut
that
my
ears
so
quickened
to
my
husband
hard
position
heard
and
grieved
over
but
he
laughed
off
the
carefully
concealed
thrust
when
we
were
at
home
in
our
own
room
if
i
asked
him
blazing
anew
with
wrath
at
such
a
stab
how
he
kept
his
temper
he
replied
why
notice
it
do
i
know
what
i
been
through
to
gain
my
victory
that
fellow
you
must
remember
has
fought
and
lost
and
knows
in
his
soul
he
go
to
the
dogs
if
he
does
hold
up
and
libbie
he
ca
do
it
and
i
am
sorry
for
him
our
brother
tom
was
less
patient
less
forbearing
for
in
one
of
his
times
of
pledge
when
the
noble
fellow
had
given
his
word
not
to
taste
a
drop
for
a
certain
season
if
a
man
he
loved
and
about
whom
he
was
anxious
would
do
the
same
he
was
sneered
at
by
a
brother
officer
with
gibes
at
his
supposed
or
attempted
superiority
tom
leaped
across
the
table
in
the
tent
where
they
sat
at
dinner
and
shook
up
his
assailant
in
a
very
emphatic
way
i
laugh
in
remembrance
of
his
choler
and
am
proud
of
it
now
i
as
gentlewoman
descended
from
a
line
of
decorous
gentlemen
and
ladies
ought
to
be
horrified
at
one
man
seizing
another
by
the
collar
and
pouncing
upon
him
regardless
of
the
marquis
of
queensbury
rules
but
i
know
that
circumstances
alter
cases
and
in
our
life
an
occasional
good
shaking
was
better
than
the
slow
justice
of
a
tedious
the
general
would
not
smile
but
there
was
a
noticeable
twisting
of
his
mustache
and
he
took
himself
out
of
the
way
to
conceal
his
feelings
when
i
pointed
my
discerning
finger
at
him
and
said
you
laughing
your
own
self
and
you
think
tom
was
right
even
if
you
do
say
a
word
and
look
so
dreadfully
at
both
of
us
the
general
did
not
keep
himself
aloof
and
sometimes
in
convivial
scenes
when
he
joined
in
the
increasing
hilarity
was
so
infused
with
the
growing
artificial
joviality
and
grew
jollier
and
jollier
that
he
was
accused
himself
of
being
the
wildest
drinker
of
them
all
but
some
one
was
sure
to
speak
up
and
say
as
the
morning
approached
i
have
sat
beside
custer
the
night
through
and
if
he
intoxicated
it
over
water
for
he
has
not
tasted
a
drop
of
wine
more
loss
to
him
i
say
only
a
short
time
before
the
final
battle
he
dined
in
new
york
at
a
house
where
general
mcdowell
was
also
a
guest
when
no
one
else
could
hear
he
told
me
with
a
warning
not
to
talk
of
it
that
he
had
some
one
to
keep
him
company
and
described
the
bowl
of
ice
that
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
untouched
semicircle
of
glasses
before
general
mcdowell
and
how
the
ice
seemed
just
as
satisfactory
as
any
of
the
rare
beverages
we
listened
once
to
john
gough
and
the
enthusiasm
over
his
earnestness
and
his
eloquence
was
enhanced
by
the
fact
of
his
failures
and
the
plucky
manner
in
which
he
started
anew
everybody
cries
over
jefferson
van
even
if
they
have
never
encountered
drunkenness
and
my
husband
wept
like
a
child
because
of
his
intense
sympathy
for
the
weakness
of
the
poor
tempted
soul
harrowed
as
he
was
by
a
xantippe
if
women
in
civil
life
were
taken
among
men
as
army
women
are
in
all
sorts
of
festivities
they
would
get
a
better
idea
of
what
strength
of
purpose
it
requires
to
carry
out
a
principle
at
some
army
posts
the
women
go
to
the
sutler
store
with
their
husbands
for
billiards
or
amusements
there
is
a
separate
room
for
the
soldiers
so
we
see
nothing
of
those
poor
fellows
who
never
can
stay
sober
the
sutler
is
not
only
the
store
but
it
is
the
for
the
garrison
and
i
have
known
posts
where
the
officers
were
so
guarded
about
their
drinking
that
women
could
go
among
them
and
join
in
any
amusement
without
being
liable
to
the
distress
that
the
sight
of
an
intoxicated
man
invariably
gives
to
a
sensitive
woman
if
i
saw
drunken
soldiers
reeling
off
after
it
was
the
greatest
possible
relief
to
me
to
know
that
out
of
hundreds
only
a
few
were
married
as
but
a
certain
number
of
the
laundresses
were
allowed
to
a
company
so
no
woman
heart
was
going
to
be
wrung
by
unsteady
steps
approaching
her
door
and
the
sight
of
the
vacant
eyes
of
a
weak
husband
it
took
away
half
the
sting
and
shock
to
know
that
a
soldier
spree
was
not
one
that
recoiled
on
an
innocent
woman
as
i
look
back
upon
our
life
i
do
not
believe
there
ever
was
any
path
so
difficult
as
those
men
on
the
frontier
trod
their
failures
their
fights
their
vacillations
all
were
before
us
and
it
was
an
anxious
life
to
be
watching
who
won
and
who
lost
in
those
moral
warfares
you
could
not
separate
yourself
from
the
interests
of
one
another
it
was
a
network
of
friendships
that
became
more
and
more
interwoven
by
common
hardships
deprivations
dangers
by
isolation
and
the
daily
sharing
of
joys
and
troubles
i
am
thankful
for
the
certainty
that
there
is
some
one
who
scores
all
our
fights
and
all
our
victories
for
on
his
records
will
be
written
the
story
of
the
thorny
path
over
which
an
officer
walked
if
he
reached
the
goal
women
shielded
in
homes
supported
by
example
unconscious
of
any
temptation
save
the
mildest
will
realize
with
me
what
it
was
to
watch
the
quivering
mouth
of
a
man
who
voluntarily
admitted
that
until
he
was
fifty
he
knew
he
was
in
hourly
peril
of
being
a
drunkard
the
tears
blind
me
as
i
go
back
in
retrospection
and
think
over
the
men
that
warred
against
themselves
in
one
respect
there
never
was
such
a
life
as
ours
it
was
eminently
one
of
partings
how
natural
then
that
the
last
act
before
separation
be
one
of
hospitable
generosity
how
little
we
had
to
offer
it
was
often
almost
an
impossibility
to
get
up
a
good
dinner
then
we
had
so
many
coming
to
us
from
a
distance
that
our
welcome
could
not
be
followed
up
by
any
entertainment
worthy
of
the
name
besides
there
were
promotions
to
celebrate
an
occasional
son
and
heir
to
toast
birthdays
occurring
so
often
and
nothing
in
the
world
that
answered
for
an
expression
of
hospitality
and
good
feeling
but
an
old
straw
demijohn
behind
the
door
it
was
surprising
what
pertinacious
lives
the
demijohns
of
the
garrison
had
the
driver
of
the
wagon
containing
the
few
appointments
of
an
officer
outfit
was
just
as
careful
of
the
familiar
friend
as
one
could
wish
servants
to
be
with
the
lares
and
penates
of
an
æsthetic
household
if
he
was
rewarded
with
a
drink
from
the
sacred
demijohn
after
having
safely
preserved
it
over
muddy
roads
where
the
mules
jerked
the
out
of
ruts
and
where
except
for
a
protecting
hand
the
contents
would
have
saturated
the
wagon
he
was
thankful
but
such
was
his
reverence
for
what
he
considered
the
most
valuable
possession
of
the
whole
wagon
virtue
alone
would
have
been
sufficient
reward
when
in
the
regimental
movings
the
crockery
the
very
heaviest
that
is
made
was
smashed
the
furniture
broken
carpets
curtains
clothes
and
bedding
mildewed
and
torn
the
old
demijohn
neither
broke
spilled
nor
suffered
any
injury
by
exposure
to
the
elements
it
was
in
the
opinion
of
our
lovers
of
good
whiskey
a
survival
of
the
fittest
it
never
came
to
be
an
old
story
with
me
that
in
this
constant
familiar
association
with
drinking
the
general
and
those
of
his
comrades
who
abstained
could
continue
to
exercise
a
marvelous
i
could
not
help
constantly
speaking
to
my
husband
of
what
he
went
through
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
no
liberty
could
be
too
great
to
extend
to
men
who
always
keeping
their
heads
were
clear
as
to
what
they
were
about
the
domestic
lariat
of
a
cavalryman
might
well
be
drawn
in
if
the
women
waiting
at
home
were
uncertain
whether
the
brains
of
their
liege
lords
would
be
muddled
when
absent
from
their
influence
chapter
xiii
a
medley
of
officers
and
men
it
was
well
we
had
our
horses
at
fort
riley
for
recreation
as
walking
was
almost
out
of
the
question
in
autumn
the
wind
blew
unceasingly
all
the
five
years
we
were
in
kansas
but
it
seemed
to
do
its
wildest
work
in
autumn
no
one
had
told
us
of
its
incessant
activity
and
i
watched
for
it
to
quiet
down
for
days
after
our
arrival
and
grew
restless
and
dull
for
want
of
exercise
but
dared
not
go
out
as
the
post
was
on
a
plateau
the
wind
from
the
two
river
valleys
swept
over
it
constantly
the
flag
was
torn
into
ribbons
in
no
time
and
the
made
smaller
and
used
in
rainy
weather
had
to
be
raised
a
good
deal
while
the
larger
and
handsomer
one
was
being
mended
we
found
that
the
other
women
of
the
garrison
who
were
there
when
we
arrived
ventured
out
to
see
one
another
and
even
crossed
the
when
it
was
almost
impossible
to
keep
on
one
feet
it
seems
to
date
very
far
back
when
i
recall
that
our
dresses
then
measured
five
yards
around
and
were
gathered
as
full
as
could
be
pressed
into
the
waistband
these
seven
breadths
of
skirt
flew
out
in
advance
of
us
if
they
did
not
lift
themselves
over
our
heads
my
skirts
wrapped
themselves
around
my
husband
ankles
and
rendered
locomotion
very
difficult
for
us
both
if
we
tried
to
take
our
evening
stroll
he
thought
out
a
plan
which
he
helped
me
to
carry
into
effect
by
cutting
bits
of
lead
in
small
strips
and
these
i
sewed
into
the
hem
thus
loaded
down
we
took
our
constitutional
about
the
post
and
outwitted
the
elements
which
at
first
bade
fair
to
keep
us
perpetually
housed
there
was
very
little
social
life
in
garrison
that
winter
the
officers
were
busy
studying
tactics
and
accustoming
themselves
to
the
new
order
of
affairs
so
very
different
from
their
volunteer
experience
had
not
everything
been
so
novel
i
should
have
felt
disappointed
in
my
first
association
with
the
regular
army
in
garrison
i
did
not
then
consider
that
the
few
old
officers
and
their
families
were
really
the
regular
army
and
so
was
somewhat
disheartened
regarding
our
future
associates
as
fast
as
our
own
officers
arrived
a
part
of
the
regiment
that
had
garrisoned
fort
riley
before
we
came
went
away
but
it
soon
became
too
late
in
the
season
to
send
the
remainder
the
post
was
therefore
crowded
the
best
manners
with
which
all
had
made
their
début
wore
off
and
some
jangling
began
some
drank
too
freely
and
were
placed
under
arrest
or
released
if
they
went
on
pledge
nothing
was
said
of
course
if
they
were
sober
enough
for
duty
but
there
were
some
hopeless
cases
from
the
first
for
instance
a
new
appointee
made
his
entrance
into
our
parlor
when
paying
the
visit
that
military
etiquette
requires
by
falling
in
at
the
door
and
after
recovering
an
upright
position
proceeded
to
entangle
himself
in
his
sword
again
and
tumble
into
a
chair
i
happened
to
be
alone
and
was
of
course
very
much
frightened
in
the
afternoon
the
officers
met
in
one
of
their
quarters
and
drew
up
resolutions
that
gave
the
new
arrival
the
choice
of
a
or
his
resignation
before
night
and
by
evening
he
had
written
out
the
papers
resigning
his
commission
another
man
whom
the
general
worked
long
and
faithfully
to
make
a
sober
officer
had
really
some
good
instincts
he
was
so
glad
to
get
into
our
home
circle
and
was
so
social
telling
the
drollest
stories
of
far
western
life
where
he
had
lived
formerly
that
i
became
greatly
interested
in
his
efforts
at
reformation
he
was
almost
the
first
to
be
for
drunkenness
on
duty
and
that
was
always
a
grief
to
us
but
in
those
early
days
of
our
regiment
history
arrest
imprisonment
and
trial
had
to
go
on
much
of
the
time
the
officer
to
whom
i
refer
was
getting
into
and
out
of
difficulty
incessantly
he
repented
in
such
a
frank
regretful
sort
of
way
that
my
husband
kept
faith
in
his
final
reformation
long
after
it
seemed
hopeless
one
day
i
asked
him
to
dinner
it
was
thanksgiving
and
on
those
days
we
tried
to
select
the
officers
that
talked
most
to
us
of
their
homes
and
parents
to
my
dismay
our
reprobate
came
into
the
room
with
very
uncertain
gait
the
other
men
looked
anxiously
at
him
my
husband
was
not
in
the
parlor
i
thought
of
other
instances
where
these
signs
of
intoxication
had
passed
away
in
a
little
while
and
tried
to
ignore
his
condition
he
was
sober
enough
to
see
the
concerned
look
in
his
comrades
faces
and
brought
the
tears
to
my
eyes
by
walking
up
to
me
and
saying
custer
sorry
but
i
think
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
go
home
who
could
help
being
grieved
for
a
man
so
frank
and
humble
over
his
failings
there
were
six
years
of
such
vicissitudes
in
this
unfortunate
man
life
varied
by
brave
conduct
in
the
indian
campaigns
before
the
general
gave
him
up
he
violated
at
last
some
social
law
that
was
considered
an
outrage
beyond
pardon
which
compelled
his
departure
from
the
seventh
that
first
winter
while
the
general
was
trying
to
enforce
one
fact
upon
the
that
the
seventh
must
be
a
sober
regiment
it
was
a
difficult
and
anything
but
pleasant
experience
illustration
general
custer
at
his
desk
in
his
library
very
few
of
the
original
appointments
remained
after
a
few
years
some
who
served
on
to
the
final
battle
of
went
through
many
struggles
in
gaining
mastery
of
themselves
the
general
believed
in
them
and
they
were
such
splendid
fighters
and
such
fine
men
when
there
was
anything
to
occupy
them
i
know
that
my
husband
appreciated
with
all
his
soul
what
trials
they
went
through
in
facing
the
monotony
of
frontier
life
indeed
he
was
himself
enduring
some
hours
of
torture
from
restlessness
and
inactivity
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
greater
change
than
from
the
wild
excitement
of
the
virginia
campaigns
the
final
scenes
of
the
war
to
the
dullness
of
fort
riley
oh
how
i
used
to
feel
when
my
morning
duties
at
the
office
were
over
and
he
walked
the
floor
of
our
room
saying
libbie
what
shall
i
do
there
were
no
books
to
speak
of
for
the
seventh
was
then
too
new
a
regiment
to
purchase
company
libraries
as
we
did
later
my
husband
never
cared
much
for
current
novels
and
these
were
almost
the
sole
literature
of
the
households
at
that
time
at
every
arrival
of
the
mail
there
was
absolute
contentment
for
a
while
the
magazines
and
newspapers
were
eagerly
read
and
i
used
to
discover
that
even
the
advertisements
were
scanned
if
the
general
was
caught
at
this
and
accused
of
it
he
slid
behind
his
paper
in
mock
humility
peeping
roguishly
from
one
side
when
a
voice
pitched
loftily
inquired
whether
reading
advertisements
was
more
profitable
than
talking
with
one
wife
it
was
hard
enough
though
when
the
heaps
of
newspapers
lay
on
the
floor
all
devoured
and
one
so
devoted
to
them
as
he
was
condemned
to
await
the
slow
arrival
of
another
mail
the
were
not
scorned
in
that
dearth
of
reading
by
the
men
about
our
fireside
we
had
among
us
a
famous
the
men
could
not
outstrip
her
in
extracting
everything
that
the
paper
held
and
the
general
delighted
in
hunting
up
accounts
of
rapscallions
from
her
native
state
cutting
out
the
paragraphs
and
sending
them
to
her
by
an
orderly
but
his
hour
of
triumph
was
brief
for
the
next
mail
was
sure
to
contain
an
account
of
either
a
michigan
or
ohio
villain
and
the
promptness
with
which
general
custer
was
made
aware
of
the
vagabondage
of
his
was
highly
appreciated
by
all
of
us
he
had
this
disadvantage
he
was
a
native
of
ohio
and
appointed
to
the
military
academy
from
there
and
that
state
claimed
him
and
very
proud
we
were
to
have
them
do
so
but
michigan
was
the
state
of
his
adoption
during
the
war
he
having
married
there
and
it
being
the
home
of
his
celebrated
michigan
brigade
he
was
enabled
by
that
bright
woman
industry
to
ascertain
what
a
large
share
of
the
population
of
those
states
were
adepts
in
crime
as
no
trifling
account
or
even
a
pickpocket
was
overlooked
i
remember
how
we
laughed
at
her
one
day
this
friend
of
ours
was
not
in
the
least
sensational
she
was
the
very
incarnation
of
delicate
refinement
all
her
reading
aside
from
the
search
for
ohio
and
michigan
villains
in
the
papers
was
of
the
loftiest
type
but
the
blood
rose
in
wild
billows
over
her
sweet
face
when
her
son
declared
his
mother
such
a
newspaper
devotee
that
he
had
caught
her
reading
the
personals
we
knew
it
was
a
fib
but
it
proves
to
what
lengths
a
person
might
go
from
sheer
desperation
when
stranded
on
the
plains
fortunately
i
was
not
called
much
from
home
as
there
were
few
social
duties
that
winter
and
we
devised
all
sorts
of
trumpery
expedients
to
vary
our
life
there
was
usually
a
wild
game
of
romps
before
the
day
was
ended
we
had
the
strangest
neighbors
a
family
lived
on
each
floor
but
the
walls
were
not
thick
as
the
government
had
wasted
no
material
in
putting
up
our
plain
quarters
we
must
have
set
their
nerves
on
edge
i
suppose
for
while
we
tore
up
stairs
and
down
using
the
furniture
for
temporary
barricades
against
each
other
the
dogs
barking
and
racing
around
glad
to
join
in
the
fracas
the
din
was
frightful
the
neighbors
not
belonging
to
our
regiment
i
am
thankful
to
say
having
come
from
a
circle
where
the
husband
brings
the
wife
to
terms
by
brute
force
in
giving
a
minute
description
of
the
sounds
that
issued
from
our
quarters
accounted
for
the
mêlée
to
those
of
the
garrison
they
could
get
to
listen
by
saying
that
the
commanding
officer
was
beating
his
wife
while
i
was
inclined
to
resent
such
accusations
they
struck
the
general
very
differently
he
thought
it
was
intensely
funny
and
the
gossip
passed
literally
in
at
one
ear
and
out
at
the
other
though
it
dwelt
with
him
long
enough
to
suggest
something
about
the
good
discipline
a
man
have
if
the
virginia
law
never
repealed
were
now
in
vogue
i
felt
sure
it
would
fare
badly
with
me
for
though
the
dimensions
of
the
stick
with
which
a
man
is
permitted
to
beat
his
wife
are
limited
to
the
size
of
the
husband
finger
my
husband
hands
though
in
good
proportion
had
fingers
the
bones
of
which
were
unusually
large
these
strange
fingers
were
not
noticeable
until
one
took
hold
of
them
but
if
they
were
carefully
studied
with
the
old
english
law
of
virginia
in
mind
there
well
might
be
a
family
mutiny
i
tried
to
beg
off
from
further
visits
to
certain
families
of
this
stamp
but
never
succeeded
the
general
insisted
on
my
going
everywhere
one
of
the
women
asked
me
one
day
if
i
rose
early
not
knowing
why
she
asked
i
replied
that
i
feared
it
was
often
before
we
awoke
whereupon
she
answered
in
an
affected
voice
that
she
never
rose
early
it
was
so
plebeian
it
was
very
discouraging
this
first
encounter
with
what
i
supposed
would
be
my
associates
there
were
many
political
appointments
in
the
army
then
each
state
was
entitled
to
its
quota
and
they
were
frequently
given
for
favoritism
regardless
of
soldierly
qualities
there
were
also
a
good
many
officers
who
having
done
good
service
during
the
war
were
given
commissions
in
the
new
regiments
for
several
years
it
was
difficult
to
arrange
everything
so
satisfactorily
in
social
life
that
no
one
feelings
would
be
hurt
the
unvarying
rule
which
my
husband
considered
should
not
be
violated
by
any
who
truly
desired
harmony
was
to
visit
every
one
in
their
circle
and
exclude
no
one
from
invitations
to
our
house
unless
for
positively
disgraceful
conduct
we
heard
from
other
posts
of
the
most
amusing
and
sometimes
the
most
uncomfortable
of
experiences
if
i
knew
any
one
to
whom
this
incident
occurred
i
should
not
venture
to
make
use
of
it
as
an
example
of
the
embarrassing
situations
in
the
new
order
of
affairs
in
the
reorganized
army
the
story
is
true
but
the
names
if
i
ever
knew
them
have
long
since
faded
out
of
memory
one
of
the
irish
laundresses
at
a
western
post
was
evidently
infatuated
with
army
life
as
she
was
the
widow
of
a
volunteer
officer
doubtless
some
old
soldier
of
the
regular
army
who
held
a
commission
in
one
of
the
regiments
during
the
war
and
the
woman
drew
the
pension
of
a
major
widow
money
therefore
could
not
have
been
the
inducement
that
brought
her
back
to
a
frontier
post
at
one
time
she
left
her
fascinating
and
went
into
the
family
of
an
officer
to
cook
but
was
obliged
to
leave
from
illness
her
place
was
filled
satisfactorily
and
when
she
recovered
and
came
back
to
the
officer
wife
she
was
told
that
the
present
cook
was
entirely
satisfactory
but
she
might
yet
find
a
place
as
another
officer
wife
whose
husband
had
been
an
enlisted
man
and
had
lately
been
appointed
an
officer
in
the
regular
regiment
stationed
there
needed
a
cook
it
seems
that
this
officer
wife
also
had
been
a
laundress
at
one
time
and
the
woman
applying
for
work
squared
herself
off
in
an
independent
manner
placed
her
arms
akimbo
and
announced
her
platform
blank
i
ken
work
for
a
leddy
but
i
ca
go
there
there
was
a
time
when
and
i
had
our
toobs
side
by
side
how
often
in
that
first
winter
i
thought
of
my
father
unstinted
praise
of
the
regular
army
as
he
had
known
it
at
sackett
harbor
and
at
detroit
in
michigan
early
days
i
could
not
but
wonder
what
he
would
think
to
be
let
down
in
the
midst
of
us
he
used
to
say
in
reference
to
my
future
daughter
marrying
into
the
army
you
will
be
poor
always
but
i
count
it
infinitely
preferable
to
riches
with
inferior
society
it
consoles
me
to
think
you
will
be
always
associated
with
people
of
refinement
meanwhile
the
general
was
never
done
begging
me
to
be
silent
about
any
new
evidences
of
vulgarity
there
were
several
women
at
fort
riley
but
they
were
so
discreet
i
never
knew
but
that
they
had
been
accustomed
to
such
associations
until
after
the
queer
lot
had
departed
and
we
dared
to
speak
confidentially
to
one
another
soon
after
the
officers
began
to
arrive
in
the
autumn
an
enlisted
man
whom
the
general
had
known
about
in
the
regular
army
reported
for
duty
he
had
reënlisted
in
the
seventh
hoping
ultimately
for
a
commission
he
was
soldierly
in
appearance
from
his
long
experience
in
military
life
and
excellently
well
versed
in
tactics
and
regimental
discipline
on
this
account
he
was
made
the
highest
officer
of
a
regiment
and
at
his
request
the
general
made
application
almost
at
once
for
his
appointment
as
a
lieutenant
in
the
seventh
cavalry
the
application
was
granted
and
the
went
to
washington
to
be
examined
the
examining
board
was
composed
of
old
and
experienced
officers
who
were
reported
to
be
opposed
to
the
appointment
of
enlisted
men
at
any
rate
the
applicant
was
asked
a
collection
of
questions
that
were
seemingly
unanswerable
i
only
remember
one
what
does
a
regiment
of
cavalry
weigh
considering
the
differences
in
the
officers
men
and
horses
it
would
seem
as
if
a
correct
answer
were
impossible
the
failed
and
returned
to
our
post
with
the
hopelessness
before
him
of
five
years
of
association
with
men
in
the
ranks
for
there
is
no
escaping
the
whole
term
of
enlistment
unless
it
is
found
that
a
man
is
under
age
but
the
general
did
not
give
up
he
encouraged
the
disappointed
man
to
hope
and
when
he
was
ordered
before
the
board
himself
he
went
to
the
secretary
of
war
and
made
personal
application
for
the
appointment
washington
was
then
full
of
men
and
their
friends
clamoring
for
the
vacancies
in
the
new
regiments
but
general
custer
was
rarely
in
washington
and
was
guarded
in
not
making
too
many
appeals
so
he
obtained
the
promise
and
soon
afterward
the
replaced
the
chevrons
with
then
ensued
one
of
those
awkward
situations
that
seem
doubly
so
in
a
life
where
there
is
such
marked
distinction
in
the
social
standing
of
an
officer
and
a
private
and
some
of
the
seventh
cavalry
made
the
situation
still
more
embarrassing
by
conspicuous
avoidance
of
the
new
lieutenant
carefully
ignoring
him
except
where
official
relations
existed
this
seemed
doubly
severe
as
they
knew
of
nothing
in
the
man
conduct
past
or
present
to
justify
them
in
such
behavior
he
had
borne
himself
with
dignity
as
living
very
much
to
himself
and
performing
every
duty
punctiliously
shortly
before
he
had
been
an
officer
like
themselves
in
the
volunteer
service
and
this
social
ostracism
solely
on
account
of
a
few
months
of
service
as
an
enlisted
man
was
absurd
they
went
back
to
his
early
service
as
a
soldier
determined
to
show
him
that
he
was
not
to
the
manner
born
the
single
men
had
established
a
mess
and
each
bachelor
officer
who
came
was
promptly
called
upon
and
duly
invited
to
join
them
at
table
there
was
literally
no
other
place
to
be
fed
there
were
no
cooks
to
be
had
in
that
unsettled
land
and
if
there
had
been
servants
to
hire
the
exorbitant
wages
would
have
consumed
a
lieutenant
pay
there
were
enough
officers
in
the
bachelors
mess
to
carry
the
day
against
the
late
my
husband
was
much
disturbed
by
this
discourteous
conduct
but
it
did
not
belong
to
the
province
of
the
commanding
officer
and
he
was
careful
to
keep
the
line
of
demarkation
between
social
and
official
affairs
distinct
yet
it
did
not
take
long
for
him
to
think
a
way
out
of
the
dilemma
he
came
to
me
to
ask
if
i
would
be
willing
to
have
him
in
our
family
temporarily
and
of
course
it
ended
in
the
invitation
being
given
in
the
evening
when
our
quarters
filled
up
with
the
bachelor
officers
they
found
the
lieutenant
whom
they
had
snubbed
established
as
one
of
the
commanding
officer
family
he
remained
as
one
of
us
until
the
officers
formed
another
mess
as
their
number
increased
and
the
new
lieutenant
was
invited
to
join
them
this
was
not
the
end
of
general
custer
marked
regard
for
him
and
as
long
as
he
lived
he
showed
his
unswerving
friendship
and
in
ways
that
the
officer
never
knew
kept
up
his
disinterested
loyalty
making
me
sure
as
years
advanced
that
he
was
worthy
of
the
old
adage
once
a
friend
always
a
friend
until
he
was
certain
that
there
was
duplicity
and
ingratitude
or
that
worst
of
sins
concealed
enmity
he
kept
faith
and
friendships
intact
at
that
time
there
was
every
reason
in
the
world
for
an
officer
whose
own
footing
was
uncertain
and
who
owed
everything
to
my
husband
to
remain
true
to
him
many
of
the
officers
were
learning
to
ride
as
they
had
either
served
in
the
infantry
during
the
war
or
were
appointed
from
civil
life
and
came
from
all
sorts
of
vocations
it
would
seem
that
hardly
half
of
the
number
then
knew
how
to
sit
or
even
to
mount
a
horse
and
the
grand
and
lofty
tumbling
that
winter
kept
us
in
a
constant
state
of
merriment
it
was
too
bad
to
look
on
and
laugh
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
resist
every
chance
i
had
to
watch
them
clambering
up
their
sides
tying
themselves
hopelessly
in
their
sabres
and
contorting
their
heels
so
wildly
that
the
restive
animal
got
the
benefit
of
a
spur
in
unexpected
places
as
likely
in
his
neck
as
in
his
flank
one
officer
who
came
to
us
from
the
merchant
marine
used
to
insist
upon
saying
to
his
brother
officers
when
off
duty
and
experimenting
with
his
steed
if
you
do
think
i
am
a
sailor
see
me
shin
up
this
horse
foreleg
some
grew
hot
and
wrathy
if
laughed
at
and
that
increased
our
fun
others
were
even
coming
into
the
midst
of
us
and
deliberately
narrating
the
number
of
times
the
horse
had
either
slipped
from
under
them
turned
them
off
over
his
head
or
rubbed
them
off
by
running
against
a
fence
or
occasionally
somebody
tried
to
hide
the
fact
that
he
had
been
thrown
and
then
there
was
high
carnival
over
the
misfortune
the
ancient
rule
that
had
existed
as
far
back
as
the
oldest
officer
could
remember
was
that
a
basket
of
champagne
was
the
forfeit
of
a
first
fall
many
hampers
were
emptied
that
winter
but
as
there
were
so
many
to
share
the
treat
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
also
it
was
native
champagne
from
louis
i
do
remember
any
uproarious
results
except
the
natural
wild
spirits
of
people
after
the
secret
was
out
and
the
forfeit
paid
there
was
much
more
courage
among
the
officers
in
letting
the
mishaps
be
known
they
did
not
take
their
nags
off
into
gullys
where
they
were
hidden
from
the
post
and
have
it
out
alone
but
tumbled
off
in
sight
of
the
galleries
of
our
quarters
and
made
nothing
of
a
whole
afternoon
of
voluntary
mounting
and
decidedly
involuntary
dismounting
one
of
the
great
among
us
told
me
his
beast
had
tossed
him
off
half
a
dozen
times
in
one
ride
but
he
ended
by
conquering
he
daily
fought
a
battle
with
his
horse
and
in
describing
the
efforts
to
unseat
him
said
that
at
last
the
animal
jumped
into
the
creek
how
i
admired
his
pluck
and
the
gleam
in
his
eye
and
what
a
glimpse
that
determination
to
master
gave
of
his
successful
future
for
he
won
in
resisting
temptation
and
conquered
in
making
himself
a
soldier
and
his
life
though
short
was
a
triumph
i
am
obliged
to
confess
that
to
this
day
i
owe
a
basket
of
champagne
for
i
belonged
to
those
that
went
off
the
horse
against
their
will
and
then
concealed
the
fact
my
husband
and
one
of
his
staff
were
riding
with
me
one
day
and
asked
me
to
go
on
in
advance
as
they
wanted
to
talk
over
something
that
was
not
of
interest
to
me
i
forgot
to
keep
watch
of
my
fiery
steed
and
when
he
took
one
of
those
mad
jumps
from
one
side
of
the
road
to
the
other
at
some
imaginary
obstacle
not
being
on
guard
i
lost
balance
and
found
myself
hanging
to
the
saddle
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
but
an
ignominious
slide
and
i
landed
in
the
dust
the
general
found
phil
trotting
riderless
toward
him
was
terribly
frightened
and
rode
furiously
toward
where
i
was
to
save
him
needless
alarm
i
called
out
all
right
from
my
lowly
position
and
was
really
quite
unharmed
save
my
crushed
spirits
no
one
can
serve
in
the
cavalry
and
not
feel
humiliated
by
a
fall
i
began
to
implore
the
two
not
to
tell
and
in
their
relief
at
my
escape
from
serious
hurt
they
promised
but
for
weeks
they
made
my
life
a
burden
to
me
by
direct
and
indirect
allusions
to
the
accident
when
a
group
of
us
were
together
they
brought
little
all
right
the
then
famous
japanese
acrobat
into
every
conversation
and
the
general
was
constantly
wondering
in
a
seemingly
innocent
manner
how
an
old
campaigner
be
unseated
under
any
circumstances
it
would
have
been
better
to
confess
and
pay
the
penalty
than
to
live
thus
under
the
sword
of
damocles
still
i
should
have
deprived
my
husband
of
a
world
of
amusement
and
every
joke
counted
in
those
dull
days
even
when
one
was
himself
the
victim
the
board
in
washington
then
examining
the
officers
of
the
new
regiments
called
old
and
new
alike
but
in
the
general
case
as
in
that
of
most
of
the
officers
who
had
seen
service
before
the
war
or
were
west
point
graduates
it
was
but
a
form
and
he
was
soon
back
in
our
post
he
began
then
a
fashion
that
he
always
kept
up
afterward
of
having
regular
openings
of
his
trunk
for
my
benefit
i
was
as
interested
in
the
contents
as
any
child
first
putting
me
under
promise
to
remain
in
one
spot
without
peeking
as
the
children
say
he
took
out
from
the
trunk
in
our
room
article
after
article
for
me
they
comprised
everything
a
woman
could
wear
from
gowns
to
stockings
with
ribbons
and
hats
if
all
the
gowns
he
brought
were
not
made
he
had
and
recollections
of
the
new
modes
of
trimming
he
enjoyed
jokes
on
himself
and
gave
us
all
a
laughable
description
of
his
discovering
in
the
city
some
fashion
that
he
had
especially
liked
when
turning
in
the
crowded
street
he
followed
at
a
respectful
distance
the
woman
wearing
it
in
order
to
commit
to
memory
the
especial
style
very
naturally
he
also
took
in
the
gait
and
figure
of
the
stylish
wearer
even
after
he
had
fixed
the
cut
of
her
gown
in
his
mind
that
he
might
eventually
transfer
it
to
me
ah
how
we
tormented
him
when
he
described
his
discomfiture
and
the
sudden
termination
of
his
walk
when
a
turn
in
the
street
revealed
the
face
of
a
negress
i
shall
have
to
ask
that
a
thought
be
given
to
our
surroundings
to
make
clear
what
an
immense
pleasure
a
trunkful
of
finery
was
at
that
time
there
were
no
shops
nearer
than
leavenworth
and
our
faces
were
set
westward
so
there
seemed
to
be
no
prospect
of
getting
such
an
outfit
for
years
there
was
no
one
in
that
far
country
to
prevent
the
screams
of
delight
with
which
each
gift
was
received
and
it
is
impossible
to
describe
how
jubilant
the
donor
was
over
the
success
of
his
purchases
brother
tom
made
a
time
always
because
his
name
was
left
out
but
he
noted
carefully
if
the
general
valise
held
a
new
supply
of
neckties
gloves
and
by
night
he
had
usually
surreptitiously
transferred
the
entire
contents
to
his
own
room
the
first
notification
would
be
his
appearance
next
morning
at
the
wearing
his
brother
new
things
his
face
perfectly
solemn
and
innocent
as
if
nothing
peculiar
was
going
on
this
sort
of
game
never
grew
old
and
it
seemed
to
give
them
much
more
amusement
than
if
the
purchases
were
formally
presented
my
husband
confided
to
me
that
knowing
tom
would
take
all
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
he
had
bought
twice
as
many
as
he
needed
the
truth
is
it
was
only
for
the
boyish
fun
they
got
out
of
it
for
he
always
shared
everything
he
had
with
his
brother
at
some
point
in
the
journey
east
the
general
had
fallen
into
conversation
with
an
officer
who
in
his
exuberance
of
spirits
at
his
appointment
to
the
seventh
had
volunteered
every
detail
about
himself
he
was
coming
from
his
examination
at
washington
and
was
full
of
excitement
over
the
new
regiment
he
had
not
the
slightest
idea
who
my
husband
was
only
that
he
was
also
an
officer
but
in
the
course
of
conversation
brought
his
name
up
giving
all
the
accounts
he
had
heard
of
him
from
both
enemies
and
friends
and
his
own
impressions
of
how
he
should
like
him
the
general
love
of
mischief
and
curiosity
to
hear
himself
so
freely
discussed
led
the
unsuspecting
man
to
ramble
on
and
on
incited
by
an
occasional
query
or
reflection
regarding
the
character
of
the
of
the
seventh
the
first
knowledge
the
lieutenant
had
with
whom
he
had
been
talking
was
disclosed
to
him
when
he
came
to
pay
the
customary
call
on
the
return
of
the
commanding
officer
at
fort
riley
his
face
was
a
study
perplexity
and
embarrassment
reddened
his
complexion
almost
to
a
purple
and
he
moved
about
uneasily
in
his
chair
abashed
to
think
he
had
allowed
himself
to
speak
so
freely
of
a
man
to
that
person
very
face
my
husband
left
him
but
a
moment
in
this
awkward
predicament
and
then
laughed
out
a
long
roll
of
merriment
grasping
the
man
hand
and
assured
him
that
he
must
remember
his
very
freely
expressed
views
were
the
opinions
of
others
and
not
his
own
it
was
a
great
relief
to
the
lieutenant
when
he
reached
his
quarters
to
find
that
he
had
escaped
some
dire
fate
either
long
imprisonment
or
slow
torture
for
at
that
time
the
volunteer
officers
had
a
deeply
fixed
terror
of
the
stern
unflinching
severity
of
regular
officers
again
he
became
confidential
and
told
the
bachelor
mess
this
was
too
good
a
chance
to
lose
they
felt
that
some
more
fun
could
still
be
extracted
and
immediately
planned
a
sham
trial
the
man
said
his
stupidity
merited
it
and
asked
for
counsel
the
case
was
spun
out
as
long
as
it
could
be
made
to
last
we
women
were
admitted
as
audience
and
all
the
grave
dignity
of
his
mock
affair
was
a
novelty
the
court
used
our
parlor
as
a
hall
of
justice
the
counsel
for
the
prisoner
was
as
earnest
in
his
defense
as
if
great
punishment
was
to
be
averted
by
his
eloquence
in
the
daytime
he
prepared
arguments
while
at
the
same
time
the
prosecuting
attorney
wrinkled
his
brows
over
the
most
convincing
assaults
on
the
poor
man
who
he
vehemently
asserted
ought
not
to
go
at
large
laden
with
such
unpardonable
crime
the
judge
addressed
the
jury
and
that
solemn
body
of
men
disappeared
into
our
room
perching
on
the
trunks
the
bed
the
few
chairs
to
seriously
discuss
the
ominous
guilty
or
not
guilty
the
manner
of
the
grave
and
dignified
judge
as
he
finally
addressed
the
prisoner
admonishing
him
as
to
his
future
sorrowfully
announcing
the
decision
of
the
jury
as
guilty
and
condemning
him
to
the
penalty
of
paying
a
basket
of
champagne
was
worthy
of
the
chief
executor
of
an
eastern
court
we
almost
regretted
that
some
one
else
would
not
by
some
harmless
misdemeanor
put
himself
within
the
reach
of
such
a
court
this
affair
gave
us
the
first
idea
of
the
clever
men
among
us
for
all
tried
to
acquit
themselves
at
their
best
even
in
the
burlesque
trial
little
by
little
it
came
out
what
varied
lives
our
officers
had
led
heretofore
some
frankly
spoke
of
the
past
as
they
became
acquainted
while
others
making
an
effort
to
ignore
their
previous
history
were
found
out
by
the
letters
that
came
into
the
post
every
mail
or
by
some
one
arriving
who
had
known
them
in
their
other
life
the
best
bred
among
them
one
descended
from
a
revolutionary
colonel
and
governor
of
a
state
the
other
from
alexander
hamilton
were
the
simplest
and
most
unaffected
in
manner
the
boaster
and
aristocrat
of
our
number
had
the
misfortune
to
come
face
to
face
with
a
townsman
who
effectually
silenced
further
reference
to
his
gorgeous
past
there
were
men
who
had
studied
law
there
was
one
who
had
been
a
in
montana
politics
and
at
last
a
judge
in
her
courts
another
who
had
been
a
and
was
distinguished
from
a
second
of
his
name
in
the
regiment
by
being
called
always
thereafter
salt
smith
while
the
younger
was
fresh
smith
or
by
those
who
were
fond
of
him
smithie
there
was
also
a
member
of
congress
who
having
returned
to
his
state
after
the
war
had
found
his
place
taken
and
himself
quite
crowded
out
when
this
officer
reported
for
duty
i
could
not
believe
my
eyes
but
a
few
months
before
in
texas
he
had
been
such
a
bitter
enemy
of
my
husband
that
with
all
the
caution
observed
to
keep
official
matters
out
of
my
life
it
could
not
be
hidden
from
me
the
general
when
this
officer
arrived
called
me
into
our
room
and
explained
that
finding
him
without
employment
in
washington
when
he
went
before
the
board
he
could
not
turn
away
from
his
appeal
for
a
commission
in
the
service
and
had
applied
without
knowing
he
would
be
sent
to
our
regiment
and
now
libbie
you
would
not
hurt
my
feelings
by
showing
animosity
and
dislike
to
a
man
whose
hair
is
already
gray
there
was
no
resisting
this
appeal
and
no
disguising
my
appreciation
of
the
manner
in
which
he
treated
his
enemies
so
his
words
brought
me
out
on
the
gallery
with
extended
hand
of
welcome
though
i
would
sooner
have
taken
hold
of
a
tarantula
i
never
felt
a
moment
regret
and
he
never
forgot
the
kindness
or
that
he
owed
his
prosperity
his
whole
future
in
fact
to
the
general
and
he
won
my
regard
by
his
unswerving
fidelity
to
him
from
that
hour
to
this
there
were
some
lieutenants
fresh
from
west
point
and
some
clerks
too
who
had
tried
to
turn
themselves
into
merchants
and
groaned
over
the
wretched
hours
they
had
spent
since
the
close
of
the
war
in
measuring
tape
we
had
several
irish
officers
reckless
riders
jovial
companions
one
had
served
in
the
papal
army
and
had
foreign
medals
there
was
an
italian
who
had
a
long
strange
career
to
draw
upon
for
our
amusement
and
numbered
among
his
experiences
imprisonment
for
plotting
the
life
of
his
king
there
were
two
officers
who
had
served
in
the
mexican
war
and
the
ears
of
the
subalterns
were
always
opened
to
their
stories
of
those
days
when
as
lieutenants
they
followed
scott
in
his
march
over
the
old
cortez
highway
to
his
victories
and
conquests
there
was
a
prussian
among
the
officers
who
though
expressing
his
approval
of
the
justice
and
courtesy
that
the
commanding
officer
showed
in
his
charge
of
the
garrison
used
to
infuriate
the
others
by
making
invidious
distinctions
regarding
foreign
service
and
our
own
we
had
an
educated
indian
as
an
officer
he
belonged
to
the
six
nations
and
his
father
was
a
scotchman
but
there
was
no
scotch
about
him
except
that
he
was
loyal
to
his
trusts
and
a
brave
soldier
for
he
looked
like
any
wild
man
of
the
plains
and
one
of
his
family
said
to
him
laughingly
dress
you
up
in
a
blanket
and
you
could
be
told
from
a
cheyenne
or
arrapahoe
there
was
a
frenchman
to
add
to
the
nationalities
we
represented
and
in
our
heterogeneous
collection
one
company
might
have
its
three
officers
with
parentage
from
three
of
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
the
immense
amount
of
rank
these
new
lieutenants
and
captains
carried
was
amusing
for
those
who
had
served
in
the
war
still
held
their
titles
when
addressed
unofficially
and
it
was
to
all
appearances
a
regiment
made
up
of
generals
colonels
and
majors
occasionally
an
officer
who
had
served
in
the
regular
army
many
years
before
the
war
arrogantly
lorded
it
over
the
young
lieutenants
one
especially
who
saw
nothing
good
in
the
service
as
it
now
was
constantly
referred
to
how
it
was
done
in
the
old
first
having
a
young
fellow
appointed
from
civil
life
as
his
lieutenant
who
knew
nothing
of
army
tactics
or
etiquette
he
found
a
good
subject
over
whom
to
tyrannize
he
gave
this
lad
to
understand
that
whenever
the
captain
made
his
appearance
he
must
jump
up
offer
him
a
chair
and
stand
attention
it
was
in
fact
a
servile
life
he
was
mapping
out
for
his
subordinate
if
the
lad
asserted
himself
in
the
slightest
way
the
captain
straightened
up
that
prussian
backbone
tapped
his
and
grandiloquently
observed
remember
the
goolf
gulf
meaning
the
great
chasm
that
intervened
between
a
with
two
bars
and
one
with
none
even
one
knowing
little
of
military
life
is
aware
that
the
goolf
between
a
captain
and
a
second
lieutenant
is
not
one
of
great
magnitude
at
last
the
youth
began
to
see
that
he
was
being
imposed
upon
and
that
other
captains
did
not
so
hold
themselves
toward
their
inferiors
in
rank
and
he
confidentially
laid
the
case
before
a
new
arrival
who
had
seen
service
asking
him
how
much
of
a
stand
he
might
make
for
his
without
infringing
on
military
rules
the
reply
was
when
next
he
tries
that
game
on
you
tell
him
to
go
to
h
with
his
gulf
the
young
fellow
not
lacking
in
spirit
returned
to
his
captain
well
primed
for
the
encounter
and
when
next
the
gulf
was
mentioned
he
stretched
up
his
six
feet
of
admirable
physique
and
advised
the
captain
to
take
the
journey
with
his
gulf
that
had
been
previously
suggested
by
his
friend
this
same
young
fellow
was
a
youth
though
a
splendid
soldier
and
had
a
knack
of
getting
into
little
altercations
with
his
on
one
occasion
at
our
house
during
a
garrison
hop
he
and
another
officer
had
some
dispute
about
dancing
with
a
young
lady
and
retired
to
the
too
courteous
to
enter
into
a
discussion
in
the
presence
of
women
it
occurred
to
them
as
words
grew
hotter
and
insufficient
for
the
gravity
of
the
occasion
that
it
would
be
well
to
interview
the
commanding
officer
fearing
that
they
might
be
placed
in
arrest
one
of
them
descended
to
the
called
the
general
one
side
told
the
story
and
asked
permission
to
pound
his
antagonist
whom
he
considered
the
aggressor
the
general
knowing
well
how
it
was
himself
having
at
west
point
been
known
as
the
cadet
who
said
stand
back
boys
and
let
have
a
fair
fight
gave
his
permission
the
door
of
the
closed
on
the
contestants
for
the
fair
lady
favor
and
they
had
it
out
alone
it
must
not
from
this
incident
be
inferred
that
our
officers
belonged
to
a
class
whose
idea
of
justice
was
knocking
down
and
dragging
out
but
in
the
newness
of
our
regiment
there
seemed
to
be
occasions
when
there
was
no
recourse
for
impositions
or
wrongs
except
in
the
natural
way
the
mettle
of
all
was
being
tested
with
a
large
number
of
men
turned
suddenly
from
a
free
life
into
the
narrow
limits
of
a
garrison
where
everybody
elbow
knocked
his
neighbor
and
no
one
could
wholly
escape
the
closest
sort
of
intercourse
it
was
the
most
natural
consequence
that
some
jarring
and
grating
went
on
none
of
us
know
how
much
the
that
we
possess
is
due
to
the
fact
that
we
can
take
refuge
in
our
homes
or
in
flight
sometimes
from
people
who
rasp
and
rub
us
up
the
wrong
way
our
regiment
was
then
a
medley
of
incongruous
elements
and
might
well
have
discouraged
a
less
persevering
man
in
the
attempt
to
mould
such
material
into
an
harmonious
whole
from
the
first
the
effort
was
to
establish
among
the
better
men
who
had
ambition
the
proper
de
regarding
their
regiment
the
general
thought
over
carefully
the
future
of
this
new
organization
and
worked
constantly
from
the
first
days
to
make
it
the
best
cavalry
regiment
in
the
service
he
assured
me
when
occasionally
i
mourned
the
inharmonious
feeling
that
early
began
to
crop
out
that
i
must
neither
look
for
fidelity
nor
friendship
in
its
best
sense
until
the
whole
of
them
had
been
in
a
fight
together
that
it
was
on
the
when
all
faced
death
together
where
the
truest
affection
was
formed
among
soldiers
i
could
not
help
noting
that
first
year
the
change
from
the
devotion
of
my
husband
division
of
cavalry
in
the
army
of
the
potomac
to
these
new
officers
who
as
yet
had
no
affection
for
him
nor
even
for
their
regiment
he
often
asked
me
to
have
patience
not
to
judge
too
quickly
of
those
who
were
to
be
our
companions
doubtless
for
years
to
come
and
reminded
me
that
as
yet
he
had
done
nothing
to
win
their
regard
or
command
their
respect
he
had
come
among
officers
and
men
as
an
organizer
a
disciplinarian
and
it
was
perfectly
natural
they
should
chafe
under
restraints
they
had
never
known
before
it
was
a
hard
place
for
my
husband
to
fill
and
a
most
thankless
task
to
bring
that
motley
crowd
into
military
subjection
the
attempted
to
report
unpleasant
criticisms
and
it
was
difficult
to
keep
in
subjection
the
jealousy
that
existed
between
west
point
graduates
volunteer
officers
and
civil
appointees
of
course
a
furtive
watch
was
kept
on
the
graduates
of
the
military
academy
for
any
evidences
of
assumed
superiority
on
their
part
or
for
the
slightest
dereliction
of
duty
the
volunteer
no
matter
how
splendid
a
record
he
had
made
during
the
war
was
excessively
sensitive
regarding
the
fact
that
he
was
not
a
graduated
officer
my
husband
persistently
fought
against
any
line
of
demarkation
between
graduates
and
he
argued
personally
and
wrote
for
publication
that
the
war
had
proved
the
volunteer
officers
did
just
as
good
service
as
and
certainly
were
not
one
whit
less
brave
than
west
pointers
i
remember
how
every
little
slip
of
a
west
pointer
was
caught
at
by
the
others
one
morning
a
group
of
men
were
gathered
about
the
at
making
the
official
report
as
officer
of
the
day
and
officer
of
the
guard
when
a
west
pointer
joined
them
in
the
irreproachable
uniform
of
a
lieutenant
walking
as
few
save
graduates
ever
do
walk
he
gravely
saluted
but
instead
of
reporting
for
duty
spoke
out
of
the
fullness
of
his
heart
gentlemen
it
a
boy
of
course
not
a
man
among
them
was
insensible
to
the
honor
of
being
the
father
of
a
first
son
and
heir
and
all
suspended
military
observances
belonging
to
the
morning
duties
and
genuinely
rejoiced
with
the
parent
but
still
they
gloated
over
the
fact
that
there
had
been
even
in
such
a
moment
of
excitement
this
lapse
of
military
dignity
in
one
who
was
considered
a
soldier
an
embarrassing
position
for
general
custer
was
that
he
had
under
him
officers
much
older
than
himself
he
was
then
but
years
of
age
and
the
people
who
studied
to
make
trouble
and
how
rarely
are
they
absent
from
any
community
used
this
fact
as
a
means
of
stirring
up
dissension
how
thankful
i
was
that
nothing
could
draw
him
into
difficulty
from
that
question
for
he
either
refused
to
listen
or
heard
only
to
forget
one
day
he
was
deeply
moved
by
the
major
of
our
regiment
general
alfred
gibbs
who
had
commanded
the
brigade
of
regular
cavalry
in
the
army
of
the
potomac
during
the
war
and
whose
soul
was
so
broad
and
his
heart
so
big
that
he
was
above
everything
petty
or
mean
my
husband
called
me
into
our
room
and
shut
the
door
in
order
to
tell
me
quietly
that
some
gossip
had
endeavored
to
spread
a
report
that
general
gibbs
was
galled
by
his
position
and
unwilling
to
submit
to
the
authority
of
so
young
a
man
on
hearing
this
he
came
straightway
to
general
custer
ah
what
worlds
of
trouble
we
would
be
saved
if
there
were
courage
to
inquire
into
slander
and
in
the
most
earnest
frank
manner
assured
him
that
he
had
never
expressed
such
sentiments
and
that
their
years
of
service
together
during
the
war
had
established
an
abiding
regard
for
his
soldierly
ability
that
made
it
a
pleasure
to
be
in
his
regiment
this
from
an
officer
who
had
served
with
distinction
in
the
mexican
war
as
well
as
done
gallant
service
in
an
indian
campaign
before
the
civil
war
was
a
most
grateful
compliment
to
my
husband
general
gibbs
was
a
famous
disciplinarian
and
he
had
also
the
quaintest
manner
of
fetching
every
one
to
the
etiquettical
standard
he
knew
to
be
necessary
he
was
witty
and
greatly
given
to
joking
and
yet
perfectly
unswerving
in
the
performance
of
the
most
insignificant
duty
we
have
exhausted
ourselves
with
laughter
as
he
described
by
contortions
of
feature
and
really
extraordinary
facial
gymnastics
his
efforts
to
dislodge
a
venturesome
and
unmilitary
fly
that
had
perched
on
his
nose
when
he
was
conducting
a
to
lift
his
hand
and
brush
off
the
intruder
with
a
long
line
of
soldiers
facing
him
was
an
example
he
would
scarcely
like
them
to
follow
and
yet
the
tantalizing
tickling
of
those
slowly
traveling
over
his
moist
and
heated
face
was
almost
too
exasperating
to
endure
if
general
gibbs
felt
the
necessity
of
reminding
any
one
of
carelessness
in
dress
it
was
managed
in
so
clever
a
manner
that
it
gave
no
lasting
offense
my
husband
absorbed
in
the
drilling
discipline
and
organization
of
the
regiment
sometimes
overlooked
the
necessity
for
social
obligations
and
immediately
came
under
the
general
witty
criticisms
if
a
strange
officer
visited
our
post
and
any
one
neglected
to
call
as
is
considered
obligatory
it
was
remarked
upon
by
our
etiquettical
mentor
if
the
officers
were
careless
in
dress
or
wore
clothes
something
quite
natural
in
young
fellows
who
wanted
to
load
on
everything
that
glittered
our
general
etiquette
made
mention
of
it
one
wore
an
english
with
a
lot
of
gilt
braid
on
top
instead
of
the
plain
visored
cap
of
the
regulations
the
way
he
came
to
know
that
this
innovation
must
be
suppressed
was
by
a
request
from
general
gibbs
to
purchase
it
for
his
bandmaster
he
himself
was
so
strictly
military
that
he
could
well
afford
to
hold
the
others
up
to
the
mark
his
coats
were
marvelous
fits
and
he
tightly
buckled
in
his
increasing
rotundity
with
a
superb
belt
and
clasp
that
had
belonged
to
his
grandfather
a
wolcott
in
the
revolutionary
war
most
women
know
with
what
obstinate
determination
and
adoring
fondness
a
man
clings
to
some
shabby
article
of
wearing
apparel
there
was
in
our
family
an
ancient
not
the
jaunty
that
i
fortunately
learned
afterward
to
make
but
a
long
clumsy
quilted
monstrosity
that
i
had
laboriously
cobbled
out
with
very
ignorant
fingers
my
husband
simply
worshiped
it
the
garment
appeared
on
one
of
his
birthdays
and
i
was
praised
beyond
my
deserts
for
having
put
in
shape
such
a
success
and
he
could
hardly
slide
out
of
his
uniform
when
he
came
from
the
office
quickly
enough
to
enable
him
to
jump
into
this
soft
loose
abomination
if
he
had
vanity
which
it
is
claimed
is
lodged
somewhere
in
every
human
breast
it
was
spasmodic
for
he
not
only
knew
that
he
looked
like
a
fright
but
his
family
told
him
this
fact
with
repeated
variations
of
derision
when
at
last
it
became
not
even
respectable
it
was
so
ragged
i
attempted
to
hide
it
but
this
did
no
earthly
good
the
beloved
possession
was
ferreted
out
and
he
gaily
danced
up
and
down
in
triumph
before
his
discomfited
wife
all
the
rags
and
tags
flaunting
out
as
he
moved
in
vain
general
gibbs
asked
me
why
i
allowed
such
a
disgraceful
old
man
garment
about
the
truth
was
there
was
not
half
the
discipline
in
our
family
that
there
might
have
been
had
we
been
citizens
a
woman
can
not
be
expected
to
keep
a
man
up
to
the
mark
in
every
little
detail
and
surely
she
may
be
excused
if
she
do
a
little
spoiling
when
after
months
of
separation
she
is
returned
to
the
one
for
whom
her
heart
has
been
wrung
with
anxiety
no
sooner
are
you
together
than
there
comes
the
terror
of
being
divided
again
general
gibbs
won
at
last
in
suppressing
the
old
for
he
begged
general
custer
to
picture
to
himself
the
appearance
of
his
entire
regiment
clad
in
ragged
gowns
modeled
after
that
of
their
commanding
officer
in
dozens
of
ways
general
gibbs
kept
us
up
to
the
mark
socially
he
never
drew
distinctions
between
the
old
army
and
the
new
as
some
were
wont
to
do
and
his
influence
in
shaping
our
regiment
in
social
as
well
as
military
affairs
was
felt
in
a
marked
manner
and
we
came
to
regard
him
as
an
authority
and
to
value
his
suggestions
chapter
xiv
the
course
of
true
love
soon
after
my
husband
returned
from
washington
he
found
that
ristori
was
advertised
in
louis
and
as
he
had
been
delighted
with
her
acting
when
in
the
east
he
insisted
upon
my
going
there
though
it
was
a
journey
of
several
hundred
miles
the
young
officers
urged
and
the
pretty
diana
looked
volumes
of
entreaty
at
me
so
at
last
i
consented
to
go
as
we
need
be
absent
but
a
few
days
at
that
time
the
dreaded
campaign
looked
far
off
and
i
was
trying
to
cheat
myself
into
the
belief
that
there
might
possibly
be
none
at
all
ristori
heard
under
any
circumstances
was
an
event
in
a
life
but
to
listen
to
her
as
we
did
the
only
treat
of
the
kind
in
our
winter
and
feeling
almost
certain
it
was
the
last
of
such
privileges
for
years
to
come
was
an
occasion
never
to
be
forgotten
i
do
not
know
whether
diana
collected
her
senses
enough
to
know
at
any
one
time
that
she
was
listening
to
the
most
gifted
woman
in
histrionic
art
a
civilian
lover
had
appeared
on
the
scene
and
between
our
young
officers
already
far
advanced
in
the
dazed
and
enraptured
state
and
the
new
addition
to
her
retinue
she
was
never
many
moments
without
airy
nothings
poured
into
her
ear
the
citizen
and
the
officers
glowered
on
each
other
and
sought
in
vain
to
monopolize
the
inamorata
even
when
the
thoughtless
girl
put
a
military
cap
on
the
head
of
a
civilian
and
told
him
that
an
improvement
in
his
appearance
was
instantly
visible
he
still
remained
and
held
his
ground
valiantly
finally
the
most
desperate
of
them
called
me
to
one
side
and
implored
my
championship
he
complained
bitterly
that
he
never
began
to
say
what
trembled
on
his
tongue
but
one
of
those
interfering
fellows
appeared
and
interrupted
him
and
now
as
the
time
was
passing
there
remained
but
one
chance
before
he
went
home
where
he
would
again
be
among
a
dozen
other
men
who
were
sure
to
get
in
his
way
he
said
he
had
thought
over
every
plan
and
if
i
would
engage
the
interfering
ones
for
a
half
hour
he
would
take
diana
to
the
hotel
cupola
ostensibly
to
see
the
view
and
if
after
they
were
up
there
she
saw
anything
but
him
it
would
not
be
his
fault
for
say
his
say
he
must
no
one
could
resist
such
a
piteous
appeal
so
i
engaged
the
supernumerary
men
in
conversation
as
best
i
could
talking
against
time
and
eyeing
the
door
as
anxiously
as
they
did
i
knew
when
the
pair
returned
that
the
avowal
had
found
utterance
but
the
coquetting
lass
had
left
him
in
such
a
state
of
uncertainty
that
even
fleeing
to
the
had
not
secured
his
future
so
it
went
on
suspense
and
agitation
increasing
in
the
perturbed
hearts
but
the
dallying
of
this
coy
and
skillful
strategist
wise
beyond
her
years
in
some
ways
seemed
to
prove
that
she
believed
what
is
often
said
that
a
man
is
more
blissful
in
uncertainty
than
in
possession
our
table
was
rarely
without
guests
at
that
time
a
great
many
of
the
strangers
came
with
letters
of
introduction
to
us
and
the
general
superintended
the
arrangements
for
if
they
were
to
be
in
the
vicinity
of
our
post
among
the
distinguished
visitors
was
prince
ourosoff
nephew
of
the
emperor
of
russia
he
was
but
a
lad
and
only
knew
that
if
he
came
west
far
enough
he
was
very
likely
to
find
what
the
atlas
put
down
as
the
great
american
desert
none
of
us
could
tell
him
much
more
of
the
sahara
of
america
than
of
his
own
steppes
in
russia
as
the
years
have
advanced
the
maps
have
shifted
that
imaginary
desert
from
side
to
side
the
pioneer
does
such
wonders
in
cultivating
what
was
then
supposed
to
be
a
barren
waste
that
we
bid
fair
in
time
not
to
have
any
sahara
at
all
i
hardly
wonder
now
at
the
surprise
this
royal
scion
expressed
at
finding
himself
among
men
and
women
who
kept
up
the
amenities
of
refined
life
even
when
living
in
that
subterranean
home
which
our
government
provided
for
its
defenders
the
it
seems
strange
enough
that
those
of
us
who
lived
the
rough
life
of
kansas
early
days
did
not
entirely
adopt
the
careless
unconventional
existence
of
the
pioneer
but
military
discipline
is
something
not
easily
set
aside
almost
our
first
excursionists
were
such
a
success
that
we
wished
they
might
be
duplicated
in
those
who
flocked
out
there
in
after
years
several
of
the
party
were
old
travelers
willing
to
undergo
hardships
and
encounter
dangers
to
see
the
country
before
it
was
overrun
with
tourists
they
were
our
guests
and
the
manner
in
which
they
beguiled
our
time
made
their
departure
a
real
regret
they
called
themselves
gideon
band
the
youngest
of
the
party
a
mccook
from
the
fighting
ohio
family
was
old
gid
while
the
oldest
of
all
answered
when
they
called
young
gid
as
they
were
witty
clever
conversant
by
actual
experience
with
most
things
that
we
only
read
of
in
the
papers
we
found
them
a
godsend
when
such
people
thanked
us
for
what
simple
hospitality
we
could
offer
it
almost
came
as
a
surprise
for
we
felt
ourselves
their
debtors
after
having
written
to
this
point
in
my
narrative
of
our
gay
visit
from
gideon
band
a
letter
in
response
to
one
that
i
had
sent
to
charles
leland
arrived
from
london
i
asked
him
about
his
poem
and
after
twenty
years
in
which
we
never
saw
him
he
recalls
with
enthusiasm
his
short
stay
with
us
i
have
only
eliminated
some
descriptions
that
he
gives
in
the
extract
of
the
private
letter
sent
then
from
fort
riley
descriptions
of
the
wife
of
the
commanding
officer
and
the
pretty
diana
women
being
in
the
minority
it
was
natural
that
we
were
never
undervalued
grateful
as
i
am
that
he
should
so
highly
appreciate
officers
wives
and
much
as
i
prize
what
he
says
regarding
the
influences
that
made
a
man
and
kept
him
what
he
was
i
must
reserve
for
leland
correspondent
of
twenty
years
back
and
for
myself
his
opinion
of
frontier
women
langham
hotel
portland
place
london
june
dear
custer
it
is
a
thousand
times
more
likely
that
you
should
forget
me
than
that
i
should
ever
forget
you
though
it
were
at
an
interval
of
twice
twenty
years
the
more
so
since
i
have
read
your
admirable
book
which
has
revived
in
me
the
memory
of
one
of
the
strangest
incidents
and
some
of
the
most
agreeable
impressions
of
a
somewhat
varied
and
eventful
life
i
was
with
a
party
of
gentlemen
who
had
gone
out
to
what
was
then
the
most
advanced
camp
for
the
pacific
railway
in
western
kansas
on
returning
we
found
ourselves
one
evening
about
a
mile
from
fort
riley
where
we
were
to
be
the
guests
of
yourself
and
your
husband
we
had
been
all
day
in
a
ambulance
or
wagon
the
one
that
i
shared
with
my
friend
hassard
of
the
new
york
was
driven
by
a
very
intelligent
and
amusing
frontiersman
deeply
experienced
in
indian
and
mexican
life
named
brigham
brigham
thought
by
mistake
that
we
had
all
gone
to
fort
riley
by
some
other
conveyance
and
he
was
thirty
or
forty
yards
in
advance
driving
on
rapidly
we
encumbered
with
blankets
packs
and
arms
had
no
mind
to
walk
when
we
could
one
man
whistled
and
all
roared
aloud
then
one
discharged
his
rifle
but
the
wind
was
blowing
away
from
brigham
towards
us
and
he
heard
nothing
the
devil
put
an
idea
in
my
head
for
which
i
have
had
many
a
regret
since
then
regina
jubes
renovare
my
queen
dost
command
me
to
revive
a
wretched
sorrow
for
it
occurred
that
i
could
send
a
so
near
to
brigham
head
that
he
could
hear
the
whistle
and
that
this
would
very
naturally
cause
him
to
stop
if
i
could
only
know
all
i
would
sooner
have
aimed
between
my
own
eyes
me
a
gun
i
said
to
colonel
lambourn
wo
shoot
at
him
said
the
colonel
you
insure
the
mules
i
replied
will
insure
the
driver
i
took
aim
and
fired
the
ambulance
was
covered
and
i
did
not
know
that
hassard
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
was
sitting
inside
and
talking
to
brigham
the
bullet
passed
between
their
faces
which
were
a
foot
apart
less
rather
than
more
is
that
cried
hassard
replied
brigham
who
knew
by
many
an
experience
how
wagons
were
apached
comanchied
or
otherwise
aboriginated
down
flat
he
drove
desperately
till
he
thought
he
was
out
of
shot
and
then
put
out
his
head
to
give
the
indians
a
taunting
i
shall
never
forget
the
appearance
of
that
sunburned
face
with
gold
and
a
vast
sombrero
what
was
his
amazement
at
seeing
only
friends
i
did
not
know
what
brigham
state
of
mind
might
be
toward
me
but
i
remembered
that
he
gloried
in
his
familiarity
with
spanish
so
i
said
to
him
in
the
dialect
fired
that
shot
is
it
to
be
hand
or
knife
between
us
it
is
to
his
credit
that
he
at
once
shook
my
hand
and
said
mano
he
drove
on
in
grim
silence
and
then
said
driven
for
twelve
years
on
this
frontier
but
i
never
heard
before
of
anybody
trying
to
stop
one
by
shooting
the
driver
another
silence
broken
by
the
following
remark
wish
to
god
there
was
a
gulch
any
where
between
here
and
the
fort
i
upset
this
party
into
it
d
n
quick
but
i
had
a
great
fear
it
was
of
general
custer
and
what
he
would
have
to
say
to
me
for
recklessly
imperiling
the
life
of
one
of
his
drivers
to
say
nothing
of
what
might
have
happened
to
a
valuable
team
of
mules
and
the
wagon
it
was
with
perturbed
feelings
and
de
mi
with
an
evil
conscience
that
i
approached
him
he
had
been
informed
of
the
incident
but
was
neither
angry
nor
vindictive
all
he
did
was
to
utter
a
hearty
laugh
and
say
never
heard
before
of
such
an
original
way
of
ringing
a
bell
to
call
a
man
in
a
letter
written
about
this
time
to
a
friend
i
find
the
following
had
not
for
many
days
seen
a
lady
indeed
the
only
woman
i
had
met
for
more
than
a
week
was
a
poor
sad
soul
who
with
her
two
had
just
been
brought
in
by
lieutenant
hesselberger
from
a
captivity
of
outrage
and
torture
among
the
apaches
you
may
imagine
how
i
was
impressed
with
general
custer
and
her
friend
miss
custer
is
an
ideal
the
ideal
of
frank
chivalry
unaffected
genial
humor
and
that
earnestness
allied
to
originality
which
is
so
characteristic
of
the
best
kind
of
western
army
man
i
have
not
in
all
my
life
met
with
so
many
interesting
types
of
character
as
during
this
my
first
journey
to
kansas
but
first
among
all
i
place
this
trio
the
evening
a
great
musical
treat
awaited
me
i
had
once
passed
six
months
in
bavaria
where
i
had
learned
to
love
the
zither
this
instrument
was
about
as
well
known
twenty
years
ago
in
america
as
a
harp
of
a
thousand
strings
but
there
was
at
the
fort
a
bavarian
soldier
who
played
charmingly
on
it
and
he
was
brought
in
i
remember
asking
him
for
many
of
his
airs
the
general
and
his
wife
impressed
me
as
two
of
the
best
entertainers
of
guests
whom
i
ever
met
the
perfection
of
this
rare
talent
is
to
enjoy
yourself
while
making
others
at
their
ease
and
merry
and
the
proof
lies
in
this
that
seldom
indeed
have
i
ever
spent
so
pleasant
an
evening
as
that
in
the
fort
my
personal
experience
of
general
custer
does
not
abound
in
anecdotes
but
is
extremely
rich
in
my
impressions
of
him
as
a
type
and
a
character
both
as
man
and
gentleman
there
is
many
a
man
whom
i
have
met
a
thousand
times
whom
i
hardly
recollect
at
all
while
i
could
never
forget
him
he
was
not
only
an
admirable
but
an
impressive
man
one
would
credit
anything
to
his
credit
because
he
was
so
frank
and
earnest
one
meets
with
a
somewhat
similar
character
sometimes
among
the
hungarians
but
just
such
a
man
is
as
rare
as
the
want
of
them
in
the
world
is
great
with
sincere
regards

not

were
a

number
of
officers
brought
together
that

from
varied
walks
in
life
and
of
different
nationalities
but
the
men
that
enlisted
ranged
from
the
highest
type
of
soldier
to
the
lowest
specimens
of
humanity
recruited
in
the
crowded
cities
it
often
happened
that
enlisted
men
had
served
an
honorable
record
as
officers
in
the
volunteer
service
some
had
entered
the
regular
army
because
their
life
was
broken
up
by
the
war
and
they
knew
not
how
to
begin
a
new
career
others
had
hopes
of
promotion
on
the
strength
of
their
war
record
or
from
the
promises
of
influential
friends
my
heart
is
moved
anew
as
i
recall
one
man
who
sank
his
name
and
individuality
his
very
self
it
seemed
by
enlistment
and
as
effectually
disappeared
as
if
he
had
flung
himself
into
the
river
that
rushed
by
our
post
one
night
there
knocked
at
the
door
of
one
of
our
officer
quarters
a
man
who
though
in
citizen
dress
was
at
once
recognized
as
an
old
comrade
in
the
war
he
had
been
a
of
volunteers
after
he
had
been
made
welcome
he
gave
some
slight
account
of
himself
and
then
said
he
had
about
made
up
his
mind
to
enlist
our
seventh
cavalry
officer
implored
him
not
to
think
of
such
a
thing
pictured
the
existence
of
a
man
of
education
and
refinement
in
such
surroundings
and
offered
him
financial
help
should
that
be
needed
he
finally
found
the
subject
was
adroitly
withdrawn
and
the
conversation
went
back
to
old
times
they
talked
on
in
this
friendly
manner
until
midnight
and
then
parted
the
next
day
a
soldier
in
fresh
bright
blue
uniform
passed
the
officer
formally
saluting
as
he
went
by
and
to
his
consternation
he
discovered
in
this
enlisted
man
his
friend
of
the
night
before
they
never
met
again
the
of
the
midnight
hour
was
in
reality
the
farewell
that
one
of
them
had
intended
it
to
be
this
is
but
one
of
many
instances
where
superior
men
for
one
reason
or
another
get
into
the
ranks
of
our
army
if
they
are
fortunate
enough
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
considerate
officers
their
lot
is
endurable
but
to
be
assigned
to
one
who
is
unjust
and
overbearing
is
a
miserable
existence
one
of
our
finest
men
was
so
constantly
looking
in
his
soldiers
for
the
same
qualities
that
he
possessed
and
insisted
so
upon
the
superiority
of
his
men
that
the
officers
were
wont
to
exclaim
in
irony
oh
yes
we
all
know
that
hamilton
company
is
made
up
of
dukes
and
earls
in
disguise
illustration
in
general
custer
library
there
were
some
clever
rogues
among
the
enlisted
men
and
the
officers
were
as
yet
scarcely
able
to
cope
with
the
cunning
of
those
who
doubtless
had
intimate
acquaintance
with
courts
of
justice
and
prisons
in
the
eastern
states
the
recruiting
officer
in
the
cities
is
not
compelled
as
in
other
occupations
to
ask
a
character
from
a
former
employer
the
government
demands
men
and
the
recruiting
sergeant
casts
his
critical
eye
over
the
anatomical
outlines
as
he
would
over
the
good
points
of
a
horse
destined
for
the
same
service
the
awful
hereafter
is
when
the
officer
that
receives
this
physical
perfection
on
the
frontier
aims
to
discover
whether
it
contains
a
soul
our
at
fort
riley
was
outside
the
garrison
a
short
distance
and
held
a
goodly
number
of
violators
of
the
regulations
for
several
nights
at
one
time
strange
sounds
for
such
a
place
issued
from
the
walls
religion
in
the
noisiest
form
seemed
to
have
taken
up
its
permanent
abode
there
and
for
three
hours
at
a
time
singing
shouting
and
loud
praying
went
on
there
was
every
appearance
of
a
revival
among
those
trespassers
the
officer
of
the
day
in
making
his
rounds
had
no
comment
to
pass
upon
this
remarkable
transition
from
and
wrangling
he
was
doubtless
relieved
to
hear
the
voice
of
the
exhorters
as
he
visited
the
guard
and
indulged
in
the
belief
that
the
prisoners
were
out
of
mischief
on
the
contrary
this
vehement
attack
of
religion
covered
up
the
worst
sort
of
roguery
night
after
night
they
had
been
digging
tunnels
under
the
stone
removing
boards
and
cutting
beams
in
the
floor
and
to
deaden
the
sound
of
the
pounding
and
digging
some
of
their
number
were
told
off
to
sing
pray
and
shout
one
morning
the
guard
opened
the
door
of
the
rooms
in
which
the
prisoners
had
been
confined
and
they
were
empty
even
two
that
wore
ball
and
chains
for
serious
offences
had
in
some
manner
managed
to
knock
them
off
as
all
had
swum
the
smoky
hill
river
and
they
were
never
again
heard
from
as
with
the
history
of
all
prisons
so
it
was
of
our
little
one
the
greatest
rogues
were
not
incarcerated
they
were
too
cunning
to
be
caught
it
often
happened
that
some
excellent
soldiers
became
innocently
involved
in
a
fracas
and
were
marched
off
to
the
while
the
archvillain
slipped
into
his
place
in
the
ranks
and
answered
to
his
name
at
apparently
the
most
exemplary
of
soldiers
several
instances
of
what
i
thought
to
be
unjust
imprisonment
came
directly
under
my
notice
and
i
may
have
been
greatly
influenced
by
pleas
in
their
behalf
we
made
the
effort
and
succeeded
in
extricating
one
man
from
his
imprisonment
whether
he
was
in
reality
wronged
or
had
only
worked
upon
our
sympathies
will
never
be
known
but
he
certainly
made
an
excellent
soldier
from
that
time
until
the
end
of
his
enlistment
eliza
in
her
own
quaint
way
is
saying
to
me
now
do
you
mind
miss
libbie
how
me
and
you
got
j
his
parole
he
used
to
come
to
our
house
with
the
rest
of
the
prisoners
to
police
the
yard
and
cut
the
wood
and
they
used
to
hang
round
my
door
the
guard
could
hardly
get
away
well
i
reckon
he
did
try
very
hard
for
he
did
like
no
better
than
they
did
one
of
them
would
speak
up
the
minute
they
saw
me
and
say
you
hai
got
no
hot
biscuit
have
you
hot
biscuits
for
prisoners
do
you
hear
miss
libbie
the
ginnel
would
be
standin
at
the
back
window
just
to
catch
a
chance
to
laugh
at
me
if
i
gave
the
prisoners
anythin
to
eat
he
stand
at
that
window
movin
from
one
foot
to
the
other
craning
of
his
neck
and
when
i
did
give
any
cold
scraps
he
just
bided
his
time
and
when
he
saw
me
he
would
say
been
issuin
your
rations
again
eliza
how
many
and
biscuit
did
they
get
this
time
miss
libbie
he
jest
said
that
he
liked
better
than
else
and
i
been
givin
away
some
of
his
but
as
soon
as
he
had
teased
me
about
it
that
was
the
end
he
would
go
along
about
his
way
and
pick
up
his
book
when
he
had
done
his
laugh
but
miss
libbie
he
used
to
kinder
mistrust
if
me
and
you
was
talkin
one
side
he
would
say
you
two
conspirin
up
now
tryin
to
get
some
one
out
of
jail
i
i
remember
how
we
worked
for
j
he
came
to
me
and
told
me
i
must
to
get
custer
to
work
for
him
two
words
from
her
would
do
him
more
good
than
all
the
rest
and
he
would
come
along
sideways
by
your
window
carrying
his
ball
over
his
arm
with
the
chain
adanglin
and
look
so
pitiful
like
so
you
would
see
him
and
beg
him
off
this
affair
ended
entirely
to
eliza
satisfaction
i
saw
the
captain
of
his
company
for
though
it
was
against
my
husband
wish
that
i
should
have
anything
to
do
with
official
matters
he
did
not
object
to
this
intervention
he
only
laughed
at
my
credulity
the
captain
politely
heard
my
statement
of
what
eliza
had
told
me
were
j
wrongs
and
gave
him
parole
his
sentence
was
rescinded
eventually
as
he
kept
his
promises
and
was
a
most
faithful
soldier
the
next
morning
after
j
was
returned
to
duty
and
began
life
anew
one
of
the
young
officers
sauntered
into
our
quarters
and
waving
his
hand
with
a
little
flourish
said
i
want
to
congratulate
you
on
having
obtained
the
pardon
of
the
greatest
scamp
in
the
regiment
he
steal
a
stove
but
would
wait
a
mighty
long
time
for
it
to
cool
later
in
my
story
is
my
husband
mention
in
his
letters
of
the
very
man
as
bearing
so
good
a
record
that
he
sent
for
him
and
had
him
detailed
at
headquarters
for
nothing
in
the
world
he
confessed
but
because
i
had
once
interceded
for
him
eliza
kept
my
sympathies
constantly
aroused
with
her
piteous
tales
of
the
wrongs
of
the
prisoners
they
daily
had
her
ear
and
she
appointed
herself
judge
jury
and
attorney
for
the
defense
on
the
coldest
days
when
we
could
not
ride
and
the
wind
blew
so
furiously
that
we
were
not
able
to
walk
i
saw
from
our
windows
how
poorly
clad
they
were
for
they
came
daily
under
the
care
of
the
guard
to
cut
the
wood
and
fill
the
the
general
quietly
endured
the
expressions
of
sympathy
and
sometimes
my
indignant
protests
against
unjust
treatment
he
knew
the
wrathful
spirit
of
the
kitchen
had
obeyed
the
natural
law
that
heat
must
rise
and
treated
our
combined
rages
over
the
prisoners
wrongs
with
aggravating
calmness
knowing
more
about
the
occupants
than
i
did
he
was
fortified
by
facts
that
saved
him
from
expending
his
sympathies
in
the
wrong
direction
he
only
smiled
at
the
plausible
stories
by
which
eliza
was
first
taken
in
at
the
kitchen
door
they
lost
nothing
by
transmission
as
she
had
quite
an
imagination
and
decidedly
a
dramatic
delivery
and
finally
when
i
told
the
tale
trying
to
perform
the
monstrously
hard
feat
of
telling
it
as
it
was
told
to
me
youth
inexperience
and
an
emotional
temperament
made
a
narrative
so
absolutely
distressing
that
the
general
was
likely
to
come
over
bodily
to
our
side
had
he
not
recalled
the
details
of
the
that
had
tried
the
soldier
we
were
routed
yet
not
completely
for
we
fell
back
upon
his
clothes
and
pleaded
that
though
he
was
thought
to
be
wicked
he
might
be
permitted
to
be
warm
but
the
colored
and
white
troops
had
to
leave
the
field
horse
foot
and
dragoons
when
on
investigation
we
found
that
the
man
for
whom
we
pleaded
had
gambled
away
his
very
shirt
the
unmoved
manner
in
which
my
husband
listened
to
different
accounts
of
supposed
cruelty
dropping
his
beloved
newspaper
with
the
injured
air
that
men
assume
while
i
sat
by
him
half
crying
gesticulating
thoroughly
roused
in
my
defense
of
the
injured
one
was
exasperating
to
say
the
least
and
then
at
last
to
have
this
bubble
of
assumed
championship
burst
and
see
him
launch
into
such
uproarious
conduct
when
he
found
that
the
man
for
whom
i
pleaded
was
the
archrogue
of
all
oh
women
alone
can
picture
to
themselves
what
the
situation
must
have
been
to
poor
me
after
one
of
these
seasons
of
scoffing
over
the
frequency
with
which
i
was
taken
in
i
mentally
resolved
that
though
the
proof
i
heard
of
the
soldier
depravity
was
too
strong
for
me
to
ignore
there
was
no
contesting
the
fact
that
the
criminal
was
cold
and
if
i
had
failed
in
freeing
him
i
might
at
least
provide
against
his
freezing
he
was
at
that
time
buttoning
a
ragged
blouse
up
to
his
chin
not
only
for
warmth
but
because
in
his
evening
game
of
poker
his
comrade
had
won
the
undergarment
quite
superfluous
he
thought
while
warmed
by
the
fire
i
proceeded
to
shut
myself
in
our
room
and
go
through
the
general
trunk
for
something
warm
the
selection
that
i
made
was
unfortunate
there
were
some
navy
shirts
of
blue
flannel
that
had
been
procured
with
considerable
trouble
from
a
gunboat
in
the
james
river
the
last
year
of
the
war
the
like
of
which
in
quality
and
durability
could
not
be
found
in
any
shop
the
material
was
so
good
that
they
neither
shrunk
nor
pulled
out
of
shape
the
broad
collar
had
a
star
embroidered
in
solid
silk
in
either
corner
the
general
had
bought
these
for
their
durability
but
they
proved
to
be
a
picturesque
addition
to
his
gay
dress
and
the
red
necktie
adopted
by
his
entire
third
division
of
cavalry
gave
a
dash
of
vivid
color
while
the
yellow
hair
contrasted
with
the
dark
blue
of
the
flannel
the
gunboats
were
overwhelmed
with
applications
to
buy
as
his
division
wished
to
adopt
this
feature
of
his
dress
also
and
military
tailors
had
many
orders
to
reproduce
what
the
general
had
lighted
upon
as
the
officers
expressed
it
by
accident
really
there
was
no
color
so
good
for
campaigning
as
it
was
hard
to
harmonize
any
gray
tint
with
the
different
blues
of
the
uniform
men
have
a
way
of
saying
that
we
women
never
seize
their
things
for
barter
or
other
malevolent
purposes
without
selecting
what
they
especially
prize
but
the
general
really
had
reason
to
dote
upon
these
shirts
the
rest
of
the
story
scarcely
needs
telling
many
injured
husbands
whose
wardrobes
have
been
confiscated
for
eleemosynary
purposes
will
join
in
a
general
wail
the
men
that
wear
one
overcoat
in
early
spring
and
carry
another
over
their
arm
to
their
offices
uncertain
if
they
did
not
observe
this
precaution
that
the
coming
winter
would
not
find
these
garments
mysteriously
metamorphosed
into
lace
on
a
gown
or
mantel
ornaments
may
fill
in
all
that
my
story
fails
to
tell
in
the
case
it
was
perhaps
more
than
ordinarily
exasperating
it
was
not
that
a
creature
who
bargains
for
gentlemen
had
possession
of
something
that
a
tailor
could
not
readily
replace
but
we
were
then
too
far
out
on
the
plains
to
buy
even
ordinary
blue
flannel
as
i
remember
myself
half
buried
in
the
trunk
of
the
commanding
officer
and
suddenly
lifted
into
the
air
with
a
shirt
in
one
hand
my
own
escape
from
the
seems
miraculous
as
it
was
i
was
let
off
very
lightly
ignoring
some
remarks
about
its
being
a
pretty
state
of
affairs
that
compels
a
man
to
lock
his
trunk
in
his
own
family
and
that
between
tom
pilfering
and
his
wife
the
commanding
officer
would
soon
be
obliged
to
receive
official
reports
in
bed
there
was
very
little
hunting
about
fort
riley
in
the
winter
the
general
had
shot
a
great
many
prairie
chickens
in
the
autumn
and
hung
them
in
the
and
while
they
lasted
we
were
not
entirely
dependent
on
government
beef
as
the
season
advanced
we
had
only
soup
and
beef
although
the
officers
were
allowed
to
buy
the
best
cuts
the
cattle
that
supplied
the
post
with
meat
were
far
from
being
in
good
condition
one
day
our
table
was
crowded
with
officers
some
of
whom
had
just
reported
for
duty
the
usual
great
tureen
of
soup
was
disposed
of
and
the
servant
brought
in
an
immense
platter
on
which
generally
reposed
a
large
roast
but
when
the
dish
was
placed
before
the
general
to
my
dismay
there
appeared
in
the
centre
of
its
wide
circumference
a
steak
hardly
larger
than
a
man
hand
it
was
a
painful
situation
and
i
blushed
gazed
uneasily
at
the
but
hesitated
about
apologies
as
they
were
my
husband
detestation
he
relieved
us
from
the
awful
silence
that
fell
upon
all
by
a
peal
of
laughter
that
shook
the
table
and
disturbed
the
poor
little
steak
in
its
lonesome
bed
eliza
thrust
her
head
in
at
the
door
and
explained
that
the
cattle
had
stampeded
and
the
commissary
could
not
get
them
back
in
time
to
kill
as
they
did
daily
at
the
post
the
general
was
perfectly
unmoved
calling
those
peculiar
staccato
all
right
all
right
to
poor
eliza
setting
affairs
at
ease
again
and
asking
the
guests
to
do
the
best
they
could
with
the
vegetables
bread
and
butter
coffee
and
dessert
the
next
day
beef
returned
to
our
table
but
alas
the
potatoes
gave
out
and
i
began
to
be
disturbed
about
my
housewifely
duties
my
husband
begged
me
not
to
give
it
a
thought
saying
that
eliza
would
pull
us
through
the
temporary
famine
satisfactorily
and
adding
that
what
was
good
enough
for
us
was
good
enough
for
our
guests
but
an
attack
of
domestic
responsibility
was
upon
me
and
i
insisted
upon
going
to
the
little
town
near
us
under
any
circumstances
the
general
opposed
my
entering
its
precincts
as
it
was
largely
inhabited
by
outlaws
and
desperadoes
and
to
go
for
so
small
a
consideration
as
marketing
was
entirely
against
his
wishes
i
paid
dearly
for
my
persistence
for
when
after
buying
what
i
could
at
the
stores
i
set
out
to
return
the
chain
bridge
on
which
i
had
crossed
the
river
in
the
morning
had
been
swept
away
and
the
roaring
torrent
that
had
risen
above
the
high
banks
was
plunging
along
its
furious
way
bearing
earth
and
trees
in
its
turbid
flood
i
spent
several
dreary
hours
on
the
bank
growing
more
uneasy
and
remorseful
all
the
time
the
potatoes
and
eggs
that
so
short
a
time
since
i
had
triumphantly
secured
seemed
more
and
more
hateful
to
me
as
i
looked
at
them
lying
in
the
basket
in
the
bottom
of
the
ambulance
i
made
innumerable
resolves
that
so
long
as
my
husband
did
not
wish
me
to
concern
myself
about
providing
for
our
table
i
never
would
attempt
it
again
but
all
these
resolutions
could
not
bring
back
the
bridge
and
i
had
to
take
the
advice
of
one
of
our
officers
who
was
also
waiting
to
cross
and
go
back
to
the
house
of
one
of
the
merchants
who
sold
supplies
to
the
post
his
wife
was
very
hospitable
as
frontier
men
and
women
invariably
are
and
next
morning
i
was
down
on
the
bank
of
the
river
early
more
impatient
than
ever
to
cross
what
made
the
detention
more
exasperating
was
that
the
buildings
of
the
garrison
on
the
plateau
were
plainly
visible
from
where
we
waited
then
ensued
the
most
foolhardy
conduct
on
my
part
and
so
terrified
the
general
when
i
told
him
afterward
that
i
came
near
never
being
trusted
alone
again
the
most
vexing
part
of
it
all
was
that
i
involved
the
officer
who
was
in
town
by
accident
in
imminent
danger
for
when
he
heard
what
i
was
determined
to
do
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
second
my
scheme
as
no
persuasion
was
of
any
avail
i
induced
a
sergeant
in
charge
of
a
small
boat
to
take
me
over
i
was
frantic
to
get
home
as
for
some
time
preparations
had
been
going
on
for
a
summer
campaign
and
i
had
kept
it
out
of
our
day
as
much
as
i
could
the
general
never
anticipated
trouble
reasoning
that
it
was
bad
enough
when
it
came
and
we
both
felt
that
every
hour
must
hold
what
it
could
of
enjoyment
and
not
be
darkened
a
moment
if
we
could
help
it
the
hours
of
delay
on
the
bank
were
almost
insupportable
as
each
one
was
shortening
precious
time
i
could
not
help
telling
the
sergeant
this
and
he
yielded
to
my
entreaties
for
what
soldier
ever
refused
our
appeals
the
wind
drove
through
the
trees
on
the
bank
lashing
the
limbs
to
and
fro
and
breaking
off
huge
branches
and
it
required
almost
superhuman
strength
to
hold
the
frail
boat
to
the
slippery
landing
long
enough
to
lift
me
in
the
soldier
at
the
prow
held
in
his
muscular
hands
a
pole
with
an
iron
pin
at
the
end
with
which
he
used
all
his
energy
to
push
away
the
floating
logs
that
threatened
to
swamp
us
it
was
almost
useless
to
attempt
to
steer
as
the
river
had
a
current
that
it
was
impossible
to
stem
the
only
plan
was
to
push
out
into
the
stream
filled
with
debris
and
let
the
current
shoot
the
boat
far
down
the
river
aiming
for
a
bend
in
its
shores
on
the
opposite
side
i
closed
my
eyes
to
the
wild
rush
of
water
on
all
sides
shuddering
at
the
shouts
of
the
soldiers
who
tried
to
make
themselves
heard
above
the
deafening
clamor
of
the
tempest
i
could
not
face
our
danger
and
retain
my
and
i
was
tortured
by
the
thought
of
having
brought
peril
to
others
i
owed
my
life
to
the
strong
and
supple
arms
of
the
sergeant
and
the
stalwart
soldier
who
assisted
him
for
with
a
spring
they
caught
the
limbs
of
an
overhanging
tree
just
at
the
important
moment
when
our
little
craft
swung
near
the
bank
at
the
river
bend
and
clutching
at
branches
and
rocks
we
were
pulled
to
the
shore
and
safely
landed
why
the
brave
sergeant
even
listened
to
such
a
wild
proposition
i
do
not
know
it
was
the
maddest
sort
of
recklessness
to
attempt
such
a
crossing
and
the
man
had
nothing
to
gain
with
the
strange
impassable
gulf
that
separates
a
soldier
from
his
officers
and
their
families
my
imploring
to
be
taken
over
the
river
and
my
overwhelming
thanks
afterward
were
the
only
words
he
would
ever
hear
me
speak
with
the
officer
who
shared
the
peril
it
was
different
when
we
sat
around
the
fireside
again
he
was
the
hero
of
the
hour
the
gratitude
of
the
officers
the
thanks
of
the
women
putting
themselves
in
my
place
and
giving
him
praise
for
encountering
danger
for
another
were
some
sort
of
compensation
the
poor
sergeant
had
nothing
he
went
back
to
the
barracks
and
sank
his
individuality
in
the
ranks
where
the
men
look
so
alike
in
their
uniform
it
is
almost
impossible
to
distinguish
the
soldier
that
has
acted
the
hero
from
one
who
is
never
aught
but
a
poltroon
after
the
excitement
of
the
peril
i
had
passed
was
over
i
no
longer
wondered
that
there
was
such
violent
opposition
to
women
traveling
with
troops
the
lesson
lasted
me
a
long
time
as
i
was
well
aware
what
planning
and
preparation
it
cost
to
take
us
women
along
in
any
case
when
the
regiment
was
on
the
move
and
to
make
these
efforts
more
difficult
by
my
own
heedlessness
was
too
serious
a
mistake
to
be
repeated
in
spite
of
the
drawbacks
to
a
perfectly
successful
garrison
which
was
natural
in
the
early
career
of
a
regiment
the
winter
had
been
full
of
pleasure
to
me
but
it
came
to
a
sad
ending
when
the
preparations
for
the
departure
of
the
troops
began
the
stitches
that
i
put
in
the
repairs
to
the
blue
flannel
shirts
were
set
with
tears
i
eagerly
sought
every
opportunity
to
prepare
the
camping
outfit
the
was
filled
with
a
few
strong
dishes
sacks
were
made
and
filled
with
coffee
sugar
flour
rice
and
a
few
cans
of
fruit
and
vegetables
were
packed
away
in
the
bottom
of
the
chest
the
means
of
transportation
were
so
limited
that
every
pound
of
baggage
was
a
matter
of
consideration
and
my
husband
took
some
of
the
space
that
i
thought
ought
to
be
devoted
to
comforts
for
a
few
books
that
admitted
of
reading
and
rereading
eliza
was
the
untiring
one
in
preparing
the
outfit
for
the
summer
she
knew
just
when
to
administer
comforting
words
as
i
sighed
over
the
preparations
and
reminded
me
that
the
ginnel
always
did
send
for
you
every
chance
he
got
and
war
times
on
the
plains
no
wuss
than
in
virginia
illustration
trophies
of
the
chase
in
general
custer
library
there
was
one
joke
that
came
up
at
every
move
we
ever
made
over
which
the
general
was
always
merry
the
officers
in
and
out
of
our
quarters
daily
were
wont
to
observe
the
unusual
alacrity
that
i
displayed
when
orders
came
to
move
as
i
had
but
little
care
or
anxiety
about
household
affairs
the
contrast
with
my
extreme
interest
in
the
arrangements
of
the
bedding
and
campaigning
clothes
was
certainly
marked
i
longed
for
activity
to
prevent
me
from
showing
my
heavy
heart
and
really
did
learn
to
be
somewhat
successful
in
crowding
a
good
deal
into
a
small
space
and
choosing
the
things
that
were
most
necessary
as
the
officers
came
in
unannounced
they
found
me
flying
hither
and
thither
intent
on
my
duties
and
immediately
saw
an
opportunity
to
tease
the
general
condoling
with
him
because
having
exhausted
himself
in
arduous
packing
for
the
campaign
he
would
be
obliged
to
set
out
totally
unfitted
for
the
summer
hardships
after
their
departure
he
was
sure
to
turn
to
me
with
roguery
in
his
voice
and
asked
if
i
had
noticed
how
sorry
all
those
young
fellows
were
for
a
man
who
was
obliged
to
work
so
hard
to
get
his
traps
ready
to
move
it
was
amusing
to
notice
the
indifferent
manner
in
which
some
of
the
officers
saw
the
careful
and
frugal
preparing
for
the
campaign
that
first
spring
experience
was
repeated
in
every
after
preparation
there
were
always
those
who
took
little
or
nothing
themselves
but
became
experts
at
casual
droppings
in
to
luncheon
or
dinner
with
some
painstaking
provider
who
endeavored
vainly
to
get
himself
out
of
sight
when
the
halt
came
for
eating
this
little
scheme
was
occasionally
persisted
in
merely
to
annoy
one
who
having
shown
some
signs
of
parsimony
needed
discipline
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
really
did
a
great
deal
of
good
by
their
ridicule
among
one
group
of
officers
who
had
planned
to
mess
together
the
only
provision
was
a
barrel
of
eggs
it
is
only
necessary
to
follow
a
cavalry
column
over
the
crossing
of
one
creek
to
know
the
exact
condition
that
such
perishable
food
would
be
in
at
the
end
of
the
first
day
there
were
two
of
the
plebes
as
the
youngest
of
the
officers
were
called
as
i
recall
them
bright
boyish
charming
fellows
who
openly
rebelled
against
the
rebuffs
they
claimed
were
given
them
when
they
attempted
to
practice
the
plan
at
another
meals
after
one
of
these
sallies
on
the
enemy
they
met
the
repulse
with
the
announcement
that
if
those
stingy
old
mollycoddles
thought
they
had
nothing
to
eat
in
their
own
outfit
they
would
show
them
and
took
the
occasion
of
one
of
their
birthdays
to
prove
that
their
resources
were
unlimited
though
the
two
endeavored
to
conceal
the
hour
and
place
of
this
fête
a
persistent
watcher
discovered
that
the
birthday
breakfast
consisted
of
a
bottle
of
native
champagne
and
corn
bread
the
hospitality
of
officers
is
too
well
known
to
make
it
necessary
to
explain
that
those
with
any
tendency
to
penuriousness
were
exceptions
an
army
legend
is
in
existence
of
an
officer
who
would
not
allow
his
hospitality
to
be
set
aside
even
though
he
was
very
short
of
supplies
being
an
officer
of
the
old
army
he
was
as
formal
over
his
repast
as
if
it
were
abundant
and
with
all
ceremony
had
his
servant
pass
the
rice
the
guest
thinking
it
the
first
course
declined
whereupon
the
host
rather
offended
replied
well
if
you
do
like
the
rice
help
yourself
to
the
mustard
this
being
the
only
other
article
on
the
bill
of
fare
there
need
be
no
doubt
as
to
his
final
choice
when
several
officers
decide
to
mess
together
on
a
campaign
each
one
promises
to
provide
some
one
necessary
supply
on
one
of
these
occasions
after
the
first
day
march
was
ended
and
orders
for
dinner
were
given
to
the
servant
it
was
discovered
that
all
but
one
had
exercised
his
own
judgment
regarding
what
was
the
most
necessary
provision
for
comfort
and
the
one
that
had
brought
a
loaf
of
bread
instead
of
a
demijohn
of
whiskey
was
berated
for
his
choice
in
the
first
days
of
frontier
life
our
people
knew
but
little
about
preparations
for
the
field
and
it
took
some
time
to
realize
that
they
were
in
a
land
where
they
could
not
live
upon
the
country
it
was
a
severe
and
lasting
lesson
to
those
using
tobacco
when
they
found
themselves
without
it
and
so
far
from
civilization
that
there
was
no
opportunity
of
replenishing
their
supply
on
the
return
from
the
expedition
the
injuries
as
well
as
the
enjoyments
are
narrated
sometimes
we
women
full
of
sympathy
for
the
privations
that
had
been
endured
found
that
these
injuries
sometimes
we
discovered
that
imagination
had
created
them
we
enjoyed
maliciously
i
am
afraid
the
growling
of
one
man
who
never
erred
in
any
way
and
consequently
had
no
margin
for
any
one
that
did
calculating
and
in
his
life
he
felt
no
patience
for
those
who
being
young
were
yet
to
learn
those
lessons
of
frugality
that
were
born
in
him
he
was
still
wrathful
when
he
gave
us
an
account
of
one
we
knew
to
be
delightfully
impudent
when
he
was
bent
on
teasing
when
the
provident
man
untied
the
strings
of
his
and
settled
himself
for
a
smoke
the
saucy
young
lieutenant
was
sure
to
stroll
that
way
and
in
tones
loud
enough
for
those
near
to
hear
him
drawl
out
i
got
a
match
if
any
other
fellow
got
a
pipe
and
tobacco
i
have
a
smoke
the
expedition
that
was
to
leave
fort
riley
was
commanded
by
general
hancock
then
at
the
head
of
the
department
of
the
missouri
he
arrived
at
our
post
from
fort
leavenworth
with
seven
companies
of
infantry
and
a
battery
of
artillery
his
letters
to
the
indian
agents
of
the
various
tribes
give
the
objects
of
the
march
into
the
indian
country
he
wrote
i
have
the
honor
to
state
for
your
information
that
i
am
at
present
preparing
an
expedition
to
the
plains
which
will
soon
be
ready
to
move
my
object
in
doing
so
at
this
time
is
to
convince
the
indians
within
the
limits
of
this
department
that
we
are
able
to
punish
any
of
them
who
may
molest
travelers
across
the
plains
or
who
may
commit
other
hostilities
against
the
whites
we
desire
to
avoid
if
possible
any
troubles
with
the
indians
and
to
treat
them
with
justice
and
according
to
the
requirements
of
our
treaties
with
them
and
i
wish
especially
in
my
dealings
with
them
to
act
through
the
agents
of
the
indian
department
as
far
as
it
is
possible
to
do
so
if
you
as
their
agent
can
arrange
these
matters
satisfactorily
with
them
we
shall
be
pleased
to
defer
the
whole
subject
to
you
in
case
of
your
inability
to
do
so
i
would
be
pleased
to
have
you
accompany
me
when
i
visit
the
country
of
your
tribes
to
show
that
the
officers
of
the
government
are
acting
in
harmony
i
shall
be
pleased
to
talk
with
any
of
the
chiefs
whom
we
may
meet
i
do
not
expect
to
make
war
against
any
of
the
indians
of
your
agency
unless
they
commence
war
against
us
in
general
custer
account
he
says
that
the
indians
had
been
guilty
of
numerous
thefts
and
murders
during
the
preceding
summer
and
autumn
for
none
of
which
had
they
been
called
to
account
they
had
attacked
the
stations
of
the
overland
killed
the
employees
burned
the
stations
and
captured
the
stock
citizens
had
been
murdered
in
their
homes
on
the
frontier
of
kansas
and
murders
had
been
committed
on
the
arkansas
route
the
principal
perpetrators
of
these
acts
were
the
cheyennes
and
sioux
the
agent
of
the
former
if
not
a
party
to
the
murder
on
the
arkansas
knew
who
the
guilty
persons
were
yet
took
no
steps
to
bring
the
murderers
to
punishment
such
a
course
would
have
interfered
with
his
trade
and
profits
it
was
not
to
punish
for
these
sins
of
the
past
that
the
expedition
was
set
on
foot
but
rather
by
its
imposing
appearance
and
its
early
presence
in
the
indian
country
to
check
or
intimidate
the
indians
from
a
repetition
of
their
late
conduct
during
the
winter
the
leading
chiefs
and
warriors
had
threatened
that
as
soon
as
the
grass
was
up
the
tribes
would
combine
in
a
united
outbreak
along
the
entire
frontier
there
had
been
little
opportunity
to
put
the
expedition
out
of
our
minds
for
some
time
previous
to
its
departure
the
sound
from
the
shop
of
the
shoeing
of
horses
the
drilling
on
the
level
ground
outside
of
the
post
and
the
loading
of
wagons
about
the
quartermaster
and
commissary
storehouses
went
on
all
day
long
at
that
time
the
sabre
was
more
in
use
than
it
was
later
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
never
again
shut
my
ears
to
the
sound
of
the
grindstone
when
i
found
that
the
sabres
were
being
sharpened
the
troopers
when
mounted
were
curiosities
and
a
decided
disappointment
to
me
the
horse
when
prepared
for
the
march
barely
showed
head
and
tail
my
ideas
of
the
dashing
trooper
going
out
to
war
clad
in
gay
uniform
and
curbing
a
curveting
steed
faded
into
nothingness
before
the
reality
though
the
wrapping
together
of
the
blanket
overcoat
and
is
made
a
study
of
the
tactics
it
could
not
be
reduced
to
anything
but
a
roll
at
the
back
of
the
saddle
the
carbine
rattled
on
one
side
of
the
soldier
slung
from
the
broad
strap
over
his
shoulder
while
a
a
a
canteen
and
a
haversack
of
hardtack
clattered
and
knocked
about
on
his
other
side
there
were
possibly
a
hundred
rounds
of
ammunition
in
his
which
took
away
all
the
symmetry
that
his
waist
might
otherwise
have
had
if
the
company
commander
was
not
too
strict
a
short
thrust
into
a
leather
case
kept
company
with
the
pistol
it
was
not
a
murderous
weapon
but
was
used
to
cut
up
game
or
slice
off
the
bacon
which
sputtering
in
the
skillet
at
evening
was
the
main
feature
of
the
soldier
supper
the
tin
utensils
the
carbine
and
the
sabre
kept
up
a
continual
din
as
the
horses
seemingly
crept
over
the
trail
at
the
rate
of
three
to
four
miles
an
hour
in
addition
to
the
cumbersome
load
there
were
sometimes
lariats
and
iron
slung
on
one
side
of
the
saddle
to
tether
the
animals
when
they
grazed
at
night
there
was
nothing
picturesque
about
this
lumbering
cavalryman
and
besides
our
men
did
not
then
sit
their
horses
with
the
serenity
that
they
eventually
attained
if
the
beast
shied
or
kicked
for
the
poor
thing
was
itself
learning
to
do
soldiering
and
occasionally
flung
out
his
heels
or
snatched
the
bit
in
his
mouth
in
protest
it
was
a
question
whether
the
newly
made
mars
would
land
on
the
crupper
or
hang
helplessly
among
the
domestic
utensils
suspended
to
his
saddle
how
sorry
i
was
for
them
they
were
so
bruised
and
lamed
by
their
first
lessons
in
horsemanship
every
one
laughed
at
every
one
else
and
this
made
it
seem
doubly
trying
to
me
i
remembered
my
own
first
lessons
among
fearless
cavalrymen
a
picture
of
a
trembling
figure
about
as
uncertain
in
the
saddle
as
if
it
were
a
wave
of
the
sea
the
hands
cold
and
nerveless
and
i
regret
to
add
the
tears
streaming
down
my
cheeks
these
recollections
made
me
writhe
when
i
saw
a
soldier
describing
an
arc
in
the
air
and
his
horse
galloping
off
to
the
music
of
tin
and
steel
in
concert
for
no
such
compulsory
landing
was
ever
met
save
by
a
roar
of
derision
from
the
column
just
in
proportion
as
i
had
suffered
for
their
misfortunes
did
i
enjoy
the
men
when
after
the
campaign
they
returned
perfect
horsemen
and
with
such
physiques
as
might
serve
for
a
sculptor
model
at
the
time
the
expedition
formed
at
fort
riley
i
had
little
realization
what
a
serious
affair
an
indian
campaign
was
we
had
heard
of
the
outrages
committed
on
the
settlers
the
attacking
of
the
overland
and
the
burning
of
the
but
the
rumors
seemed
to
come
from
so
far
away
that
the
reality
was
never
brought
home
to
me
until
i
saw
for
myself
what
horror
attends
indian
depredations
even
a
disaster
to
one
that
seemed
to
be
of
our
own
family
failed
to
implant
in
me
that
terror
of
indians
which
a
month
or
two
later
i
realized
to
its
fullest
extent
by
personal
danger
i
must
tell
my
reader
by
going
back
to
the
days
of
the
war
something
of
the
one
that
first
showed
us
what
indian
warfare
really
was
it
was
a
sad
preparation
for
the
campaign
that
followed
after
general
custer
had
been
promoted
from
a
captain
to
a
in
his
brigade
lay
quietly
in
camp
for
a
few
days
to
recruit
before
setting
out
on
another
raid
this
gave
the
unusual
privilege
of
lying
in
bed
a
little
later
in
the
morning
instead
of
springing
out
before
dawn
for
several
mornings
in
succession
my
husband
told
me
he
saw
a
little
boy
steal
through
a
small
opening
in
the
tent
take
out
his
clothes
and
boots
and
after
a
while
creep
back
with
them
brushed
and
folded
at
last
he
asked
eliza
where
on
earth
that
cadaverous
little
image
came
from
and
she
explained
that
it
was
a
poor
little
picked
sparrow
of
a
chile
who
had
come
hangin
aroun
the
mos
starved
and
added
now
ginnel
you
must
go
and
turn
him
off
for
he
got
nowhar
to
go
and
like
he
crazy
to
wait
on
you
the
general
questioned
him
and
found
that
the
boy
being
unhappy
at
home
had
run
away
enough
of
his
sad
life
was
revealed
to
convince
the
general
that
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
return
him
to
his
eastern
home
for
he
was
a
determined
little
fellow
and
there
was
no
question
that
he
would
have
fled
again
his
parents
were
rich
and
my
husband
evidently
knew
who
they
were
but
the
story
was
confidential
so
i
never
knew
anything
of
him
except
that
he
was
always
showing
signs
of
even
though
he
lived
about
the
a
letter
that
my
husband
wrote
to
his
own
home
at
that
time
spoke
of
a
hound
puppy
that
one
of
his
soldiers
had
given
to
him
and
then
of
a
little
waif
called
johnnie
whom
he
had
taken
as
his
servant
the
boy
he
wrote
is
so
fond
of
the
pup
he
takes
him
to
bed
with
him
evidently
the
child
began
his
service
with
devotion
for
the
general
adds
i
think
he
would
rather
starve
than
to
see
me
go
hungry
i
have
dressed
him
in
soldier
clothes
and
he
rides
one
of
my
horses
on
the
march
returning
from
the
march
one
day
i
found
johnnie
with
his
sleeves
rolled
up
he
had
washed
all
my
soiled
clothes
and
hung
them
on
the
bushes
to
dry
small
as
he
is
they
were
very
well
done
soon
after
johnnie
became
my
husband
servant
we
were
married
and
i
was
taken
down
to
the
virginia
that
was
used
as
brigade
headquarters
by
this
time
eliza
had
initiated
the
boy
into
all
kinds
of
work
she
in
turn
fed
him
mended
his
clothes
and
managed
him
lording
it
over
the
child
in
a
lofty
but
never
unkind
manner
she
had
tried
to
drill
him
to
wait
on
the
table
as
she
had
seen
the
duty
performed
on
the
old
plantation
at
our
first
dinner
he
was
so
bashful
i
thought
he
would
drop
everything
my
husband
did
not
believe
in
having
a
head
and
foot
to
the
table
when
we
were
alone
so
poor
little
johnnie
was
asked
to
put
my
plate
beside
the
general
though
he
was
so
embarrassed
in
this
new
phase
of
his
life
he
was
never
so
intimidated
by
the
responsibility
eliza
had
pressed
upon
him
that
he
was
or
confused
regarding
one
point
he
invariably
passed
each
dish
to
the
general
first
possibly
my
husband
noticed
it
i
certainly
did
not
there
was
a
pair
of
watchful
eyes
at
a
crack
in
the
which
took
in
this
little
incident
one
day
the
general
came
into
our
room
laughing
his
eyes
sparkling
with
fun
over
description
of
how
she
had
noticed
johnnie
always
serving
the
general
first
and
had
labored
with
him
in
secret
to
teach
him
to
wait
on
the
lady
first
it
manners
she
said
believing
that
was
a
crushing
argument
but
johnnie
usually
obedient
persistently
refused
always
replying
that
the
general
was
the
one
of
us
two
that
ranked
and
he
ought
to
be
served
first
at
the
time
of
general
kilpatrick
famous
raid
when
he
went
to
take
richmond
general
custer
was
ordered
to
make
a
détour
in
an
opposite
direction
in
order
to
deceive
the
confederate
army
as
to
the
real
object
to
be
accomplished
this
ruse
worked
so
successfully
that
general
custer
and
his
command
were
put
in
so
close
and
dangerous
a
situation
it
was
with
difficulty
that
any
of
them
escaped
the
general
told
me
that
when
the
pursuit
of
the
enemy
was
hottest
and
everyone
doing
his
utmost
to
escape
he
saw
johnnie
driving
a
light
covered
wagon
at
a
gallop
which
was
loaded
with
turkeys
and
chickens
he
had
received
his
orders
from
eliza
before
setting
out
to
bring
back
something
for
the
mess
and
the
boy
had
carried
out
her
directions
with
a
vengeance
he
impressed
into
his
service
the
establishment
that
he
drove
and
filled
it
with
poultry
even
in
the
mêlée
and
excitement
of
retreat
the
general
was
wonderfully
amused
and
amazed
too
at
the
little
fearlessness
he
was
too
fond
of
him
to
leave
him
in
danger
so
he
galloped
in
his
direction
and
called
to
him
as
he
stood
up
lashing
his
horse
to
abandon
his
capture
or
he
would
be
himself
a
prisoner
the
boy
obeyed
but
hesitatingly
cut
the
harness
sprang
upon
the
unsaddled
back
and
was
soon
with
the
main
column
the
general
by
his
delay
was
obliged
to
take
to
an
open
field
to
avoid
capture
and
leap
a
high
fence
in
order
to
overtake
the
retreating
troops
he
became
more
and
more
interested
in
the
boy
who
was
such
a
combination
of
courage
and
fidelity
and
finally
arranged
to
have
him
enlist
as
a
soldier
the
war
was
then
drawing
to
its
close
and
he
secured
to
the
lad
a
large
bounty
which
he
placed
at
interest
for
him
and
after
the
surrender
persuaded
johnnie
to
go
to
school
it
was
difficult
to
induce
him
to
leave
but
my
husband
realized
what
injustice
it
was
to
keep
him
in
the
menial
position
to
which
he
desired
to
return
and
finally
left
him
with
the
belief
that
he
had
instilled
some
ambition
into
the
boy
a
year
and
a
half
afterward
as
we
were
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
gallery
of
our
quarters
at
fort
riley
we
noticed
a
stripling
of
a
lad
walking
toward
us
with
his
head
hanging
on
his
breast
in
the
shy
embarrassed
manner
of
one
who
doubts
his
reception
with
a
glad
cry
my
husband
called
out
that
it
was
johnnie
cisco
and
bounded
down
the
steps
to
meet
him
after
he
was
assured
of
his
welcome
he
told
us
that
it
had
been
impossible
for
him
to
stay
away
he
longed
so
constantly
to
be
again
with
us
and
added
that
if
we
would
only
let
him
remain
he
would
not
care
what
he
did
of
course
the
general
regretted
the
giving
up
of
his
school
but
now
that
he
had
made
the
long
journey
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
he
decided
that
he
should
continue
with
us
until
he
could
find
him
employment
for
he
was
determined
that
he
should
not
reënlist
the
boy
old
and
tried
friend
eliza
at
once
assumed
her
position
of
missus
and
tyrant
gave
him
every
comfort
and
made
him
her
vassal
without
a
remonstrance
from
the
man
for
he
was
only
too
glad
to
be
in
the
sole
home
he
knew
no
matter
on
what
terms
soon
after
his
coming
the
general
obtained
from
one
of
the
managers
of
the
wells
fargo
express
company
a
place
of
messenger
and
the
recommendation
he
gave
the
boy
for
honesty
and
fidelity
was
confirmed
over
and
over
again
by
the
officers
of
the
express
line
he
was
known
on
the
entire
route
from
ogden
to
denver
and
was
entrusted
with
immense
amounts
of
gold
in
its
transmission
from
the
colorado
mines
to
the
states
several
times
he
came
to
our
house
for
a
vacation
and
my
husband
had
always
the
unvarying
and
genuine
welcome
that
no
one
doubted
when
once
given
and
he
did
not
fail
to
praise
and
encourage
the
friendless
fellow
eliza
after
learning
what
the
lad
had
passed
through
in
his
dangers
from
indians
treated
him
like
a
conquering
hero
but
alternately
bullied
and
petted
him
still
at
last
there
came
a
long
interval
between
his
visits
and
my
husband
sent
to
the
express
people
to
inquire
poor
johnnie
had
gone
like
many
another
brave
employee
of
that
venturesome
firm
in
a
courageous
defense
of
the
passengers
and
the
company
gold
when
the
stage
was
attacked
he
had
been
killed
by
the
indians
eliza
kept
the
battered
valise
that
her
favorite
had
left
with
us
and
mourned
over
it
as
if
it
had
been
something
human
i
found
her
cherishing
the
bag
in
a
hidden
corner
and
recalling
to
me
with
tears
how
johnnie
was
saying
that
the
night
the
news
of
her
old
mother
death
came
to
her
from
virginia
he
had
sat
up
till
daybreak
to
keep
the
fire
going
miss
libbie
i
tole
him
to
go
to
bed
but
he
said
eliza
i
ca
do
it
when
you
are
in
trouble
when
i
had
no
friends
and
could
help
myself
you
helped
me
after
that
the
lad
was
always
poor
johnnie
and
many
a
boy
with
kinsfolk
of
his
own
is
not
more
sincerely
mourned
as
the
days
drew
nearer
for
the
expedition
to
set
out
my
husband
tried
to
keep
my
spirits
up
by
reminding
me
that
the
council
to
be
held
with
the
chiefs
of
the
warlike
tribes
when
they
reached
that
part
of
the
country
infested
with
the
marauding
indians
was
something
he
hoped
might
result
in
our
speedy
reunion
he
endeavored
to
induce
me
to
think
as
he
did
that
the
indians
would
be
so
impressed
with
the
magnitude
of
the
expedition
that
after
the
council
they
would
accept
terms
and
abandon
the
eight
companies
of
our
own
regiment
were
going
out
and
these
with
infantry
and
artillery
made
a
force
of
fourteen
hundred
men
it
was
really
a
large
expedition
for
the
plains
but
the
recollections
of
the
thousands
of
men
in
the
third
cavalry
division
which
was
the
general
command
during
the
war
made
the
expedition
seem
too
small
even
for
safety
no
one
can
enumerate
the
terrors
imaginary
and
real
that
filled
the
hearts
of
women
on
the
border
in
those
desperate
days
the
buoyancy
of
my
husband
had
only
a
momentary
effect
in
the
last
hours
of
his
stay
that
time
seemed
to
fly
fast
but
no
amount
of
excitement
and
bustle
of
preparation
closed
my
eyes
even
momentarily
to
the
dragging
hours
that
awaited
me
such
partings
are
such
a
torture
that
it
is
difficult
even
to
briefly
mention
them
my
husband
added
another
struggle
to
my
lot
by
imploring
me
not
to
let
him
see
the
tears
that
he
knew
for
his
sake
i
could
keep
back
until
he
was
out
of
sight
though
the
band
played
its
usual
departing
tune
the
girl
i
left
behind
me
if
there
was
any
music
in
the
notes
it
was
all
in
the
minor
key
to
the
men
who
left
their
wives
behind
them
no
expedition
goes
out
with
shout
and
song
if
loving
weeping
women
are
left
behind
those
who
have
not
assumed
the
voluntary
fetters
that
bind
us
for
weal
or
for
woe
and
render
it
impossible
to
escape
suffering
while
those
we
love
suffer
or
rejoicing
while
those
to
whom
we
are
united
are
jubilant
felt
too
keenly
for
their
comrades
when
they
watched
them
tear
themselves
from
clinging
arms
inside
the
threshold
of
their
homes
even
to
keep
up
the
stream
of
idle
chaffing
that
only
such
occasions
can
stop
there
was
silence
as
the
column
left
the
garrison
alas
the
closed
houses
they
left
were
as
still
as
if
death
had
set
its
seal
upon
the
door
no
sound
but
the
sobbing
and
moans
of
women
breaking
hearts
eliza
stood
guard
at
my
door
for
hours
and
hours
until
i
had
courage
and
some
degree
of
peace
to
take
up
life
again
a
loving
suffering
woman
came
to
sleep
with
me
for
a
night
or
two
the
hours
of
those
first
wakeful
nights
seemed
endless
the
anxious
unhappy
creature
beside
me
said
gently
in
the
small
hours
libbie
are
you
awake
oh
yes
i
replied
and
have
been
for
ever
so
long
what
are
you
doing
saying
over
hymns
snatches
of
poetry
the
lord
prayer
backward
counting
to
try
to
put
myself
to
sleep
oh
say
some
rhyme
to
me
in
mercy
name
for
i
am
past
all
hope
of
sleep
while
i
am
so
unhappy
then
i
repeated
over
and
over
again
a
single
verse
written
perhaps
by
some
one
who
like
ourselves
knew
little
of
the
genius
of
poetry
but
alas
much
of
what
makes
up
the
theme
of
all
the
sad
verses
of
the
world
there
something
in
the
parting
hour
that
chills
the
warmest
heart
but
kindred
comrade
lover
friend
are
fated
all
to
part
but
this
i
seen
and
many
a
pang
has
pressed
it
on
my
mind
the
one
that
goes
is
happier
than
he
who
stays
behind
perhaps
after
i
had
said
this
and
another
similar
verse
over
and
over
again
in
a
droning
voice
the
regular
breathing
at
my
side
told
me
that
the
poor
tired
heart
had
found
temporary
forgetfulness
but
when
we
came
to
the
sad
reality
of
our
lonely
life
next
day
every
object
in
our
quarters
reminded
us
what
it
is
to
stay
behind
there
are
no
lonely
women
who
will
not
realize
how
the
very
chairs
or
anything
in
common
use
take
to
themselves
voices
and
call
out
reminders
of
what
has
been
and
what
now
is
fill
up
the
time
as
we
might
there
came
each
day
at
twilight
an
hour
that
should
be
left
out
of
every
solitary
life
it
is
meant
only
for
the
happy
who
need
make
no
subterfuges
to
fill
up
hours
that
are
already
precious

a
prairie
fire
it
was
a
great
change
for
us
from
the
bustle
and
excitement
of
the
cavalry
as
they
prepared
for
the
expedition
to
the
dull
routine
of
an
infantry
garrison
that
replaced
the
dashing
troopers
it
was
intensely
quiet
and
we
missed
the
clatter
of
the
horses
hoofs
the
click
of
the
which
had
come
from
the
stables
at
the
morning
and
evening
grooming
of
the
animals
the
voices
of
the
officers
drilling
the
recruits
the
constant
passing
and
repassing
of
mounted
men
in
front
of
our
quarters
above
all
the
enlivening
ringing
out
all
day
and
we
rebelled
at
the
drum
and
bugle
that
seemed
so
tame
in
contrast
there
were
no
more
long
rides
for
me
for
custis
lee
was
taken
out
at
my
request
as
i
feared
no
one
would
give
him
proper
care
at
the
post
even
the
little
chapel
where
the
officers
voices
had
added
their
music
to
the
chants
was
now
nearly
deserted
the
chaplain
was
an
interesting
man
and
the
general
and
most
of
the
garrison
had
attended
the
services
during
the
winter
only
three
women
were
left
to
respond
and
as
we
had
all
been
reared
in
other
churches
we
quaked
a
good
deal
for
fear
our
responses
would
not
come
in
the
right
place
they
did
not
lack
in
earnestness
for
when
had
we
lonely
creatures
such
cause
to
send
up
petitions
as
at
that
time
when
those
for
whom
we
prayed
were
advancing
into
an
enemy
country
day
by
day
never
had
the
beautiful
litany
that
asks
deliverance
for
all
in
trouble
sorrow
perplexity
temptation
borne
such
significance
to
us
as
then
no
one
can
dream
until
it
is
brought
home
to
him
how
space
doubles
trebles
quadruples
when
it
is
impossible
to
see
the
little
wire
that
fragile
as
it
seems
chains
one
to
the
absent
it
is
difficult
to
realize
now
that
our
country
is
cobwebbed
with
telegraph
lines
what
a
despairing
feeling
it
was
in
those
days
to
get
far
beyond
the
blessed
mode
of
communication
he
who
crosses
the
ocean
knows
a
few
days
of
such
uncertainty
but
over
the
pathless
sea
of
western
prairie
it
was
chaos
after
the
sound
of
the
last
horse
hoof
was
lost
in
the
distance
we
had
not
been
long
alone
when
a
great
danger
threatened
us
the
level
plateau
about
our
post
and
the
valley
along
the
river
near
us
were
covered
with
dry
prairie
grass
which
grows
thickly
and
is
matted
down
into
close
clumps
it
was
discovered
one
day
that
a
narrow
thread
of
fire
was
creeping
on
in
our
direction
scorching
these
tufts
into
shrivelled
brown
patches
that
were
ominously
smoking
when
first
seen
as
i
begin
to
write
of
what
followed
i
find
it
difficult
for
even
those
living
in
western
states
and
territories
regard
descriptions
of
as
exaggerated
and
are
apt
to
look
upon
their
own
as
the
extreme
to
which
they
ever
attain
i
have
seen
the
mild
type
and
know
that
a
horseman
rides
through
such
quiet
conflagrations
in
safety
the
trains
on
some
of
our
western
roads
pass
harmless
through
belts
of
country
when
the
flames
are
about
them
there
is
no
impending
peril
because
the
winds
are
moderate
when
a
tiny
flame
is
discovered
in
kansas
or
other
states
where
the
wind
blows
a
hurricane
so
much
of
the
time
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
although
we
saw
what
was
hardly
more
than
a
suspicion
of
smoke
and
the
slender
sinuous
red
tongue
along
the
ground
we
women
had
read
enough
of
the
fires
in
kansas
to
know
that
the
small
blaze
meant
that
our
lives
were
in
jeopardy
most
of
us
were
then
unacquainted
with
those
precautions
which
the
experienced
plainsman
takes
and
indeed
we
had
no
ranchmen
near
us
to
set
us
the
example
of
caution
which
the
frontiersman
so
soon
learns
we
should
have
had
furrows
ploughed
around
the
entire
post
in
double
lines
a
certain
distance
apart
to
check
the
approach
of
fire
there
was
no
time
to
fight
the
foe
with
a
like
weapon
by
burning
over
a
portion
of
the
grass
between
the
advancing
blaze
and
our
post
the
smoke
rose
higher
and
higher
beyond
us
and
curling
creeping
fire
began
to
ascend
into
waves
of
flame
with
alarming
rapidity
and
in
an
incredibly
short
time
we
were
overshadowed
with
a
dark
pall
of
smoke
the
plains
were
then
new
to
us
it
is
impossible
to
appreciate
their
vastness
at
first
the
very
idea
was
hard
to
realize
that
from
where
we
lived
we
looked
on
an
uninterrupted
horizon
we
felt
that
it
must
be
the
spot
where
some
one
first
said
the
sky
fits
close
down
all
around
it
fills
the
soul
with
wonder
and
awe
to
look
upon
the
vastness
of
that
sea
of
land
for
the
first
time
as
the
sky
became
lurid
and
the
blaze
swept
on
toward
us
surging
to
and
fro
in
waving
lines
as
it
approached
nearer
and
nearer
it
seemed
that
the
end
of
the
world
when
all
shall
be
rolled
together
as
a
scroll
had
really
come
the
whole
earth
appeared
to
be
on
fire
the
sky
was
a
sombre
canopy
above
us
on
which
flashes
of
brilliant
light
suddenly
appeared
as
the
flames
rose
fanned
by
a
fresh
gust
of
wind
there
were
no
screams
nor
cries
simply
silent
terror
and
shiverings
of
horror
as
we
women
huddled
together
to
watch
the
remorseless
fiend
advancing
with
what
appeared
to
be
inevitable
annihilation
of
the
only
shelter
we
had
every
woman
thoughts
turned
to
her
natural
protector
now
far
away
and
longed
with
unutterable
longing
for
one
who
at
the
approach
of
danger
stood
like
a
bulwark
of
courage
and
defense
the
river
was
half
a
mile
away
and
our
feet
could
not
fly
fast
enough
to
reach
the
water
before
the
enemy
would
be
upon
us
there
was
no
such
a
thing
as
a
the
government
then
had
not
even
provided
the
storehouses
and
quarters
with
the
babcock
extinguisher
we
were
absolutely
powerless
and
could
only
fix
our
fascinated
gaze
upon
the
approaching
foe
in
the
midst
of
this
appalling
scene
we
were
startled
anew
by
a
roar
and
shout
from
the
soldiers
barracks
some
one
had
at
last
presence
of
mind
to
marshal
the
men
into
line
and
assuming
the
commanding
tone
that
ensures
action
and
obedience
in
emergencies
gave
imperative
orders
every
one
citizen
employees
soldiers
and
officers
seized
gunny
sacks
blankets
poles
anything
available
that
came
in
their
way
and
raced
wildly
beyond
the
post
into
the
midst
of
the
blazing
grass
forming
a
cordon
they
beat
and
lashed
the
flames
with
the
blankets
so
twisted
as
to
deal
powerful
blows
it
was
a
frenzied
fight
the
soldiers
yelled
swore
and
leaped
frantically
upon
beds
of
blazing
grass
condensing
a
lifetime
of
riotous
energy
into
these
perilous
moments
we
women
were
not
breathless
and
trembling
over
fears
for
ourselves
alone
our
hearts
were
filled
with
terror
for
the
brave
men
who
were
working
for
our
deliverance
they
were
men
to
whom
we
had
never
spoken
nor
were
we
likely
ever
to
speak
to
them
so
separated
are
the
soldiers
in
barracks
from
an
officer
household
sometimes
we
saw
their
eyes
following
us
respectfully
as
we
rode
about
the
garrison
seeming
to
have
in
them
an
air
of
possession
as
if
saying
that
our
or
our
colonel
wife
now
they
were
showing
their
loyalty
for
there
are
always
a
few
of
a
regiment
left
behind
to
care
for
the
company
property
or
to
take
charge
of
the
gardens
for
the
soldiers
these
men
and
all
the
other
brave
fellows
with
them
imperiled
their
lives
in
order
that
the
officers
who
had
gone
out
for
indian
warfare
might
come
home
and
find
all
well
let
soldiers
know
that
a
little
knot
of
women
are
looking
to
them
as
their
saviors
and
you
will
see
what
nerves
of
iron
they
have
what
inexhaustible
strength
they
can
exhibit
no
sooner
had
the
flames
been
stamped
out
of
one
portion
of
the
plain
than
the
whole
body
of
men
were
obliged
to
rush
off
in
another
direction
and
begin
the
thrashing
and
tramping
anew
it
seemed
to
us
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
conquering
anything
so
insidious
but
the
wind
that
had
been
the
cause
of
our
danger
saved
us
at
last
that
very
wind
which
we
had
reviled
all
winter
for
its
doleful
howlings
around
our
quarters
and
down
the
chimneys
that
selfsame
wind
that
had
infuriated
us
by
blowing
our
hats
off
when
we
went
out
to
walk
or
impeded
our
steps
by
twisting
our
skirts
into
hopeless
folds
about
our
ankles
was
now
to
be
our
savior
suddenly
veering
as
is
its
fashion
in
kansas
it
swept
the
long
tongues
of
flame
over
the
bluffs
beyond
us
where
the
lonely
coyote
and
its
mate
were
driven
into
their
lair
by
this
vagary
of
the
element
that
is
never
anywhere
more
variable
than
in
kansas
our
quarters
our
few
possessions
and
no
doubt
our
lives
were
saved
with
faces
begrimed
and
blistered
their
clothes
black
with
soot
and
smoke
their
hands
burnt
and
numb
from
violent
effort
the
soldiers
and
citizen
employees
dragged
their
exhausted
bodies
back
to
garrison
and
dropped
down
anywhere
to
rest
the
tinge
of
green
that
had
begun
to
appear
was
now
gone
and
the
charred
earth
spread
as
far
as
we
could
see
making
more
desolate
the
arid
treeless
country
upon
which
we
looked
it
was
indeed
a
blackened
and
dismal
desert
that
encircled
us
and
we
knew
that
we
were
deprived
of
the
delight
of
the
tender
green
of
early
spring
which
carpets
the
plains
for
a
brief
time
before
the
sun
parches
and
turns
to
russet
and
brown
the
turf
of
our
western
prairies
as
we
sat
on
the
gallery
grieving
over
this
ruin
of
spring
gibbs
gathered
her
two
boys
closer
to
her
as
she
shuddered
over
another
experience
with
prairie
fire
where
her
children
were
in
peril
the
little
fellows
in
charge
of
a
soldier
were
left
temporarily
on
the
bank
of
a
creek
imagine
the
horror
of
a
mother
who
finds
as
she
did
the
grass
on
fire
and
a
broad
strip
of
flame
separating
her
from
her
children
before
the
little
ones
could
follow
their
first
instinct
and
thereby
encounter
certain
death
by
attempting
to
run
through
the
fire
to
their
mother
the
devoted
soldier
who
had
left
them
but
a
moment
realizing
that
they
would
instantly
seek
their
mother
ran
like
an
antelope
to
where
the
narrowed
leaped
the
flame
seized
the
little
men
and
plunged
with
mad
strides
to
the
bank
of
the
creek
where
god
be
praised
nature
provides
a
refuge
from
the
relentless
foe
of
our
western
plains
in
our
western
prairie
fires
the
flame
is
often
a
mile
long
perhaps
not
rising
over
a
foot
high
but
sweeping
from
six
to
ten
miles
an
hour
it
requires
the
greatest
exertion
of
the
ranchmen
with
all
kinds
of
improvised
flails
to
beat
out
the
fire
the
final
resort
of
a
frontiersman
if
the
flames
are
too
much
for
him
to
overcome
is
to
take
refuge
with
his
family
cattle
horses
in
the
garden
where
the
growing
vegetables
make
an
effectual
protection
alas
when
he
finds
it
safe
to
venture
from
the
green
oasis
the
crops
are
not
only
gone
but
the
roots
are
burned
and
the
ground
valueless
from
the
parching
of
the
terrible
heat
when
a
prairie
fire
is
raging
at
ten
miles
an
hour
the
hurricane
lifts
the
tufts
of
loosened
bunch
grass
which
in
occasional
clumps
is
longer
than
the
rest
carrying
it
far
beyond
the
main
fire
and
thus
starting
a
new
flame
no
matter
how
weary
the
pioneer
may
be
after
a
day
march
he
neglects
no
precautions
that
can
secure
him
from
fire
he
twists
into
wisp
the
longest
of
the
bunch
grass
trailing
it
around
the
camp
the
fire
thus
started
is

it
has
burned

the
first
letters
sent
back
from
the
expedition
by
scouts
made
days
for
us
the
official
envelope
stained
with
rain
and
mud
bursting
open
with
the
many
pages
crowded
in
sometimes
even
tied
with
a
string
by
some
messenger
through
whose
hands
the
parcel
passed
told
stories
of
the
vicissitudes
of
the
missive
in
the
difficult
journey
to
our
post
these
letters
gave
accounts
of
the
march
to
fort
larned
where
a
great
camp
was
established
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
chiefs
with
whom
the
council
was
to
be
held
while
the
runners
were
absent
on
their
messages
to
the
tribes
some
effort
was
made
to
protect
the
troops
against
the
still
sharp
winds
of
early
spring
the
halt
and
partly
permanent
camp
was
most
fortunate
for
had
the
troops
been
on
the
march
a
terrible
that
ensued
would
have
wrought
havoc
for
the
cold
became
so
intense
and
the
snow
so
blinding
it
was
only
through
great
precautions
that
loss
of
life
was
prevented
the
animals
were
given
an
extra
ration
of
oats
while
the
guards
were
obliged
to
take
whips
and
strike
at
the
horses
on
the
to
keep
them
in
motion
and
prevent
them
from
freezing
the
snow
was
eight
inches
deep
a
remarkable
fall
for
kansas
at
that
time
of
the
year
as
we
read
over
these
accounts
which
all
the
letters
contained
though
mine
touched
lightly
on
the
subject
owing
to
my
husband
fixed
determination
to
write
of
the
bright
side
we
felt
that
we
had
hardly
a
right
to
our
fires
and
comfortable
quarters
there
were
officers
on
the
expedition
who
could
not
keep
warm
a
number
were
then
enduring
their
first
exposure
to
the
elements
and
i
remember
that
several
who
afterward
became
stalwart
healthy
men
were
then
partial
invalids
owing
to
sedentary
life
in
the
states
delicate
lungs
or
climatic
influences
in
my
husband
letters
there
was
a
laughable
description
of
his
lending
his
dog
to
keep
a
friend
warm
the
officer
came
into
his
tent
after
dark
declaring
that
no
amount
of
bedding
had
any
effect
in
keeping
out
the
cold
and
he
had
come
to
borrow
a
dog
to
see
if
he
could
have
one
night
uninterrupted
rest
our
old
hound
was
offered
because
he
could
cover
such
a
surface
for
he
was
a
big
brute
and
when
he
once
located
himself
he
rarely
moved
until
morning
my
husband
forgot
in
giving
rover
his
recommendation
to
mention
a
habit
he
had
of
sleeping
audibly
besides
a
little
fashion
of
twitching
his
legs
and
thumping
his
cumbrous
tail
in
dreams
that
were
evidently
of
the
chase
or
of
battles
he
was
living
over
in
which
turk
the
was
being
vanquished
he
was
taken
into
the
neighbor
tent
and
induced
to
settle
for
the
night
after
the
general
coaxing
and
pretense
of
going
to
sleep
beside
him
later
when
he
went
back
to
see
how
rover
worked
as
a
portable
furnace
he
found
the
officer
sound
asleep
on
his
back
emitting
such
nasal
notes
as
only
a
stout
man
is
equal
to
while
rover
lay
sprawled
over
the
broad
chest
of
his
host
where
he
had
crept
after
he
was
asleep
snoring
with
an
occasional
interlude
of
a
snort
introduced
in
a
manner
peculiar
to
foxhounds
the
next
morning
my
husband
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
after
what
he
had
seen
the
night
before
to
receive
a
call
from
the
officer
who
presented
a
request
to
exchange
dogs
he
said
that
when
he
made
the
proposal
he
did
not
expect
to
have
a
bedfellow
that
would
climb
up
over
his
lungs
and
crush
all
the
breath
out
of
his
body
instead
of
showing
proper
sympathy
the
general
threw
himself
on
his
pallet
and
roared
with
laughter
all
these
camp
incidents
brightened
up
the
long
letters
and
kept
me
from
realizing
as
i
read
what
were
the
realities
of
that
march
undertaken
so
early
in
the
season
but
as
the
day
advanced
and
the
garrison
exchanged
the
news
contained
in
all
the
letters
that
had
arrived
from
the
expedition
i
could
not
deceive
myself
into
the
belief
that
the
way
of
our
regiment
had
thus
far
been
easy
with
all
my
endeavors
to
divide
the
day
methodically
and
enforce
certain
duties
upon
myself
knowing
well
that
it
was
my
only
refuge
from
settled
melancholy
i
found
time
a
laggard
it
is
true
my
clothes
were
in
a
deplorable
state
for
while
our
own
officers
were
with
us
they
looked
to
us
to
fill
up
their
leisure
hours
the
general
always
devoted
to
his
books
could
read
in
the
midst
of
our
noisy
circle
but
i
was
never
permitted
much
opportunity
and
managed
to
keep
up
with
the
times
by
my
husband
account
of
the
important
news
and
by
the
agreeable
method
of
listening
to
the
discussions
of
the
men
upon
topics
of
the
hour
if
while
our
circle
was
intact
i
tried
to
sew
a
ride
a
walk
or
a
game
of
parlor
croquet
was
proposed
to
prevent
my
even
mending
our
clothing
now
that
we
were
alone
it
was
necessary
to
make
the
needle
fly
eliza
was
set
up
with
a
supply
of
gowns
and
aprons
while
my
own
dresses
were
reconstructed
the
was
fortified
with
patches
and
any
amount
of
stout
linen
thread
disappeared
in
strengthening
the
seams
for
between
the
hard
riding
and
the
gales
of
wind
we
encountered
the
destruction
of
a
habit
was
rapid
diana
with
the
elastic
heart
of
a
coquette
had
not
only
sped
the
parting
but
welcomed
the
coming
guest
for
hardly
had
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
died
away
before
a
new
officer
began
to
frequent
our
parlor
it
was
then
the
fashion
for
men
to
wear
a
tiny
called
a
butterfly
tie
they
were
made
on
a
pasteboard
foundation
with
a
bit
of
elastic
cord
to
fasten
them
to
the
i
knew
of
no
pasteboard
nearer
than
leavenworth
but
in
the
curly
head
there
were
devices
to
meet
the
exigency
i
found
diana
with
her
lap
full
of
photographs
cutting
up
the
portraits
of
the
departed
beaux
to
make
ties
for
the
next
whether
the
new
suitor
ever
discovered
that
he
was
wearing
at
his
neck
the
face
of
a
predecessor
i
do
not
know
but
this
i
do
remember
that
the
jagged
frayed
appearance
that
the
girl
dresses
presented
when
turned
inside
out
betrayed
where
the
silk
was
procured
to
make
the
neckties
she
had
clipped
out
bits
of
material
where
the
skirt
was
turned
in
and
when
we
attempted
to
remodel
ourselves
and
cut
down
the
voluminous
breadths
of
that
time
into
tightly
gored
princesse
gowns
we
were
put
to
it
to
make
good
the
deficiencies
and
piece
out
the
silk
that
had
been
sacrificed
to
her
flirtations
succeeding
letters
from
my
husband
gave
an
account
of
his
first
experience
with
the
perfidy
of
the
indians
the
council
had
been
held
and
it
was
hoped
that
effectual
steps
were
taken
to
establish
peace
but
as
is
afterward
related
the
chiefs
gave
them
the
slip
and
deserted
the
village
even
in
the
midst
of
hurried
preparations
to
follow
the
renegades
my
husband
stopped
in
order
that
his
departure
might
not
make
me
depressed
to
give
an
account
of
a
joke
that
they
all
had
on
one
of
their
number
who
dared
to
eat
soup
out
of
an
indian
kettle
still
simmering
over
the
deserted
fire
the
general
pressed
the
retreating
indians
so
closely
the
very
night
of
their
departure
that
they
were
obliged
to
divide
into
smaller
detachments
and
even
the
experienced
plainsmen
could
no
longer
trace
a
trail
meanwhile
as
our
officers
were
experiencing
all
sorts
of
new
phases
in
life
on
their
first
march
over
the
plains
our
vicissitudes
were
increasing
at
what
seemed
to
be
the
peaceful
fort
riley
i
had
seen
with
dismay
that
the
cavalry
were
replaced
by
negro
infantry
and
found
that
they
were
to
garrison
the
post
for
the
summer
i
had
never
seen
negroes
as
soldiers
and
these
raw
recruits
had
come
from
plantations
where
i
had
known
enough
of
their
life
while
in
texas
and
louisiana
to
realize
what
an
irresponsible
child
existence
it
was
entirely
dependent
on
some
one
care
and
without
a
sense
of
obligation
of
any
kind
they
were
exempt
from
the
necessity
of
thinking
about
the
future
their
time
had
been
spent
in
following
the
directions
of
the
overseer
in
the
or
cotton
brake
by
day
and
beguiling
the
night
with
a
or
the
banjo
the
early
days
of
their
soldiering
were
a
reign
of
terror
to
us
women
in
our
lonely
unprotected
homes
it
was
very
soon
discovered
that
the
officer
who
commanded
them
was
for
the
first
time
accustoming
himself
to
colored
troops
and
did
not
know
how
to
keep
in
check
the
boisterous
undisciplined
creatures
he
was
a
courteous
quiet
man
of
scholarly
tastes
and
evidently
entertained
the
belief
that
moral
suasion
would
eventually
effect
any
purpose
the
negroes
doubtless
discovering
what
they
could
do
under
so
mild
a
commander
grew
each
day
more
lawless
they
used
the
which
our
officers
had
consecrated
to
the
most
formal
of
ceremonies
like
and
for
a
playground
turning
all
over
the
sprouting
grass
and
vaulting
in
over
the
bent
back
of
a
comrade
if
it
were
possible
for
people
in
the
states
to
realize
how
sacred
the
of
a
western
post
is
how
hurriedly
a
venturesome
cow
or
loose
horse
is
marshaled
off
how
pompously
every
one
performs
the
military
duties
permitted
on
this
little
square
how
even
the
who
marches
at
measured
gait
to
take
down
and
furl
the
garrison
flag
when
the
evening
gun
announces
that
the
sun
has
been
by
the
royal
mandate
of
military
law
permitted
to
set
they
would
then
understand
with
what
perturbation
we
women
witnessed
the
desecration
of
what
had
been
looked
upon
as
hallowed
earth
the
sacrilege
of
these
monkey
acrobats
turning
somersaults
over
the
ground
their
elongated
heels
vibrating
in
the
air
while
they
stood
upon
their
heads
in
front
of
our
windows
made
us
very
indignant
when
one
patted
juba
and
a
group
danced
we
seemed
transformed
into
a
disconnected
minstrel
show
there
was
not
a
trace
of
the
post
of
a
short
time
before
all
this
frivolity
was
but
the
prelude
to
serious
trouble
the
joy
with
which
the
negroes
came
into
possession
of
a
gun
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
would
have
been
ludicrous
had
it
not
been
extremely
dangerous
they
are
eminently
a
race
given
over
to
display
this
was
exhibited
in
their
attempts
to
make
themselves
marksmen
in
a
single
day
one
morning
we
were
startled
by
a
shot
coming
from
the
barracks
it
was
followed
by
a
rush
of
men
out
of
the
doors
running
wildly
to
and
fro
yelling
with
alarm
we
knew
that
some
disaster
had
occurred
and
it
proved
to
be
the
instant
death
of
a
too
confiding
negro
who
had
allowed
himself
to
be
cast
for
the
part
of
william
tell
son
his
accidental
murderer
was
a
man
that
had
held
a
gun
in
his
hand
that
week
for
the
first
time
they
had
no
sort
of
idea
how
to
care
for
their
health
the
ration
of
a
soldier
is
so
large
that
a
man
who
can
eat
it
all
in
a
day
is
renowned
as
a
glutton
i
think
but
few
instances
ever
occur
where
the
entire
ration
is
consumed
by
one
man
it
is
not
expected
and
fortunately
with
all
the
economy
of
the
government
the
supply
has
never
been
cut
down
but
the
surplus
is
sold
and
a
company
fund
established
by
this
means
the
meagre
fare
is
increased
by
buying
vegetables
if
it
happen
to
be
a
land
where
they
can
be
obtained
the
negroes
for
the
first
time
in
possession
of
all
the
coffee
pork
sugar
and
hardtack
they
wanted
ate
inordinately
there
was
no
one
to
compel
them
to
cleanliness
if
a
soldier
in
a
white
regiment
is
very
untidy
the
men
become
indignant
and
as
the
voluminous
regulations
provide
directions
only
for
the
scrubbing
of
the
quarters
and
not
of
the
men
they
sometimes
take
the
affair
into
their
own
hands
and
finding
from
their
captain
that
they
will
not
be
interfered
with
the
untidy
one
is
taken
on
a
compulsory
journey
to
the
creek
and
ducked
until
the
soldiers
consider
him
endurable
the
negroes
at
that
time
had
no
idea
of
encountering
the
chill
of
cold
water
on
their
tropical
skins
and
suffered
the
consequences
very
soon
pestilence
broke
out
among
them
smallpox
black
measles
and
other
contagious
diseases
raged
while
the
soldier
enemy
scurvy
took
possession
we
were
within
a
of
the
barracks
of
course
the
illest
among
them
were
quarantined
in
outside
the
garrison
but
to
look
over
to
the
infested
barracks
and
realize
what
lurked
behind
the
walls
was
to
say
the
least
uncomfortable
for
those
of
us
who
were
near
enough
to
breathe
almost
the
same
air
added
to
this
we
felt
that
with
so
much
indiscriminate
firing
a
shot
might
at
any
time
enter
our
windows
one
evening
a
few
women
were
walking
outside
the
garrison
our
limits
were
not
so
circumscribed
at
that
time
as
they
were
in
almost
all
the
places
where
i
was
stationed
afterward
a
sentinel
always
walked
a
beat
in
front
of
a
small
arsenal
outside
of
the
post
and
overcome
with
the
grandeur
of
carrying
a
gun
and
wearing
a
uniform
he
sought
to
impress
his
soldierly
qualities
on
anyone
approaching
by
a
stentorian
who
comes
thar
it
was
entirely
unnecessary
as
it
was
light
enough
to
see
the
fluttering
skirts
of
women
for
the
winds
kept
our
drapery
in
constant
motion
almost
instantly
after
his
challenge
the
flash
of
his
gun
and
the
whizz
of
a
bullet
past
us
made
us
aware
that
our
lives
were
spared
only
because
of
his
inaccurate
aim
of
course
that
ended
our
evening
walks
and
it
was
a
great
deprivation
as
the
monotony
of
a
garrison
becomes
almost
unbearable
there
was
one
person
who
profited
by
the
presence
of
the
negro
troops
our
eliza
was
such
a
belle
that
she
would
have
elevated
them
into
too
exalted
a
sphere
to
wait
on
us
had
she
not
been
accustomed
to
constant
adulation
from
the
officers
from
the
time
as
she
expressed
it
when
she
entered
the
service
still
it
was
a
distraction
of
which
she
availed
herself
in
our
new
post
to
receive
new
beaux
tire
of
them
quarrel
and
discard
them
for
fresh
victims
they
waited
on
her
assiduously
and
i
suspect
they
dined
daily
in
our
kitchen
as
long
as
their
brief
season
of
favor
lasted
they
even
sought
to
curry
favor
with
eliza
by
gifts
to
me
snaring
quail
imprisoning
them
in
cages
made
of
or
bring
dandelion
greens
or
as
they
appeared
in
the
dells
for
all
these
gifts
i
was
duly
grateful
but
i
was
very
much
afraid
of
a
negro
soldier
nevertheless
at
last
our
perplexities
and
frights
reached
a
climax
one
night
we
heard
the
measured
tramp
of
feet
over
the
gravel
in
the
road
in
front
of
our
quarters
and
they
halted
almost
opposite
our
windows
where
we
could
hear
the
voices
no
loud
halt
who
comes
there
rang
out
on
the
air
for
the
sentinel
was
enjoined
to
silence
being
frightened
i
called
to
eliza
to
diana
and
to
me
she
was
worth
a
corporal
guard
and
could
not
be
equaled
as
a
defender
solacer
and
general
manager
of
our
dangerous
situations
indeed
of
all
our
affairs
eliza
ran
in
response
to
my
cry
and
we
watched
with
terror
what
went
on
it
soon
was
discovered
to
be
a
mutiny
the
men
growled
and
swore
and
we
could
see
by
their
threatening
movements
that
they
were
in
a
state
of
exasperation
they
demanded
the
commanding
officer
and
as
he
did
not
appear
they
clenched
their
fists
and
looked
at
the
house
as
if
they
would
tear
it
down
or
at
least
break
in
the
doors
it
seemed
a
desperate
situation
to
us
for
the
quarters
were
double
and
our
gallery
had
no
division
from
the
neighbors
if
doors
and
windows
were
to
be
demolished
there
would
be
little
hope
for
ours
i
knew
of
no
way
by
which
we
could
ask
help
as
most
of
the
soldiers
were
colored
and
we
felt
sure
that
the
plan
whatever
it
was
must
include
them
all
at
last
eliza
realized
how
terrified
i
was
and
gave
up
the
absorbing
watch
she
was
keeping
for
her
whole
soul
was
in
the
wrongs
real
or
fancied
of
her
race
too
often
had
she
comforted
me
in
my
fears
to
forget
me
now
and
an
explanation
was
given
of
this
alarming
outbreak
the
men
had
for
some
time
been
demanding
the
entire
ration
and
were
especially
clamorous
for
all
the
sugar
that
was
issued
very
naturally
the
captain
had
withheld
the
supernumerary
supplies
in
order
to
make
company
savings
for
the
purpose
of
buying
vegetables
a
mutiny
over
sugar
may
seem
a
small
affair
but
it
assumes
threatening
proportions
when
a
mob
of
menacing
furious
men
tramp
up
and
down
in
front
of
house
and
there
is
no
safe
place
of
refuge
nor
any
one
to
whom
appeal
can
be
made
eliza
kept
up
a
continuous
comforting
and
reassuring
but
when
i
reminded
her
that
our
door
had
no
locks
or
rather
no
keys
for
it
was
not
the
custom
to
lock
army
quarters
she
said
la
miss
libbie
they
wo
tech
you
you
dun
wrote
too
many
letters
for
and
got
too
many
good
vittels
in
your
kitchen
ever
to
you
strong
excitement
is
held
to
be
the
means
of
bringing
out
the
truth
and
here
were
the
facts
revealed
that
they
had
been
bountifully
fed
at
our
expense
i
had
forgotten
how
much
ink
i
had
used
in
trying
to
put
down
their
very
words
in
or
family
epistles
to
the
southern
plantation
the
infuriated
men
had
to
quiet
down
for
no
response
came
from
the
commanding
officer
they
found
out
i
suppose
from
the
investigations
of
one
acting
as
spy
and
going
to
the
rear
of
the
quarters
that
he
had
disappeared
to
our
intense
relief
they
straggled
off
until
their
growling
and
muttering
were
lost
in
the
barracks
where
they
fortunately
went
to
bed
no
steps
were
taken
to
punish
them
and
at
any
imaginary
wrong
they
might
feel
from
the
success
of
this
first
attempt
at
insurrection
that
it
was
safe
to
repeat
the
experiment
we
women
had
little
expectation
but
that
the
summer
would
be
one
of
carousal
and
open
rebellion
against
military
rule
the
commanding
officer
though
very
retiring
was
so
courteous
and
kindly
to
all
the
women
left
in
the
garrison
that
it
was
difficult
to
be
angry
with
him
for
his
failure
to
control
the
troops
indeed
his
was
a
hard
position
to
fill
with
a
lot
of
undisciplined
ignorant
ungoverned
creatures
who
had
never
been
curbed
except
by
the
punishment
of
plantation
life
meanwhile
my
letters
on
which
i
wrote
every
day
even
if
there
was
no
opportunity
to
send
them
made
mention
of
our
frights
and
uncertainties
each
mail
carried
out
letters
from
the
women
to
the
expedition
narrating
their
fears
we
had
not
the
slightest
idea
that
there
was
a
remedy
i
looked
upon
the
summer
as
the
price
i
was
to
pay
for
the
privilege
of
being
so
far
on
the
frontier
so
much
nearer
the
expedition
than
the
families
of
officers
who
had
gone
east
with
all
my
tremors
and
misgivings
i
had
no
idea
of
retreating
to
safe
surroundings
as
i
should
then
lose
my
hope
of
eventually
going
out
to
the
regiment
it
took
a
long
time
for
our
letters
to
reach
the
expedition
and
a
correspondingly
long
time
for
replies
but
the
descriptions
of
the
night
of
mutiny
brought
the
officers
together
in
council
and
the
best
disciplinarian
of
our
regiment
was
immediately
despatched
to
our
relief
i
knew
but
little
of
general
gibbs
at
that
time
my
husband
had
served
with
him
during
the
war
and
valued
his
soldierly
ability
and
sincere
friendship
he
had
been
terribly
wounded
in
the
indian
wars
before
the
civil
war
and
was
really
unfit
for
hard
service
but
too
soldierly
to
be
willing
to
remain
at
the
rear
in
a
week
after
his
arrival
at
our
post
there
was
a
marked
difference
in
the
state
of
affairs
out
of
the
seemingly
hopeless
material
general
gibbs
made
soldiers
who
were
used
as
guards
over
government
property
through
the
worst
of
the
indian
country
and
whose
courage
was
put
to
the
test
by
frequent
attacks
where
they
had
to
defend
themselves
as
well
as
the
supplies
the
opinion
of
soldier
and
citizen
alike
underwent
a
change
regarding
negroes
as
soldiers
on
certain
duty
to
which
they
were
fitted
a
ranchman
after
praising
their
fighting
before
the
season
was
ended
said
and
plague
on
my
cats
if
they
do
like
it
we
soon
found
that
we
had
reached
a
country
where
the
weather
could
show
more
remarkable
and
sudden
phases
in
a
given
time
than
any
portion
of
the
united
states
the
cultivation
of
the
ground
planting
of
trees
and
such
causes
have
materially
modified
some
of
the
extraordinary
exhibitions
that
we
witnessed
when
kansas
was
supposed
to
be
the
great
american
desert
with
all
the
surprises
that
the
elements
furnished
there
was
one
that
we
would
gladly
have
been
spared
one
quiet
day
i
heard
a
great
rumbling
in
the
direction
of
the
plateau
where
we
had
ridden
so
much
as
if
many
heavily
laden
were
being
spirited
away
by
the
stampede
of
mules
next
our
house
began
to
rock
the
bell
to
ring
and
the
pictures
to
vibrate
on
the
wall
the
mystery
was
solved
when
we
ran
to
the
gallery
and
found
the
garrison
rushing
out
of
barracks
and
quarters
women
and
children
ran
to
the
all
hatless
some
everybody
stared
at
every
one
else
turned
pale
and
gasped
with
fright
it
was
an
earthquake
sufficiently
serious
to
shake
our
stone
quarters
and
overturn
the
lighter
articles
while
farther
down
the
gully
the
great
stove
at
the
sutler
store
was
tumbled
over
and
the
side
of
the
building
broken
in
by
the
shock
there
was
a
deep
fissure
in
the
side
of
the
bank
and
the
waters
of
the
big
blue
were
so
agitated
that
the
bed
of
the
river
twelve
feet
deep
was
plainly
visible
the
usual
session
of
the
took
place
and
resolutions
were
drawn
up
not
committed
to
paper
however
giving
the
opinion
of
women
on
kansas
as
a
place
of
residence
we
had
gone
through
pestilence
mutiny
a
river
freshet
and
finally
an
earthquake
enough
exciting
events
to
have
been
scattered
through
a
lifetime
were
crowded
into
a
few
weeks
yet
in
these
conclaves
when
we
sought
sympathy
and
courage
from
one
another
there
was
never
a
suggestion
of
returning
to
a
climate
chapter
xvi
sacrifices
and
of
pioneer
duty
captain
robbins
and
colonel
cook
attacked
and
fight
for
three
hours
it
is
a
source
of
regret
as
these
pages
grow
daily
under
my
hand
that
i
have
not
the
power
to
place
before
the
country
the
sacrifices
and
noble
courage
endured
by
the
officers
and
soldiers
of
our
army
in
their
pioneer
work
i
can
only
portray
in
the
simplest
manner
what
i
saw
them
endure
unmurmuringly
as
i
was
permitted
to
follow
in
the
marches
and
campaigns
of
our
regiment
i
find
that
it
is
impossible
to
make
the
life
clear
to
citizens
even
when
they
ask
me
to
describe
personally
something
of
frontier
days
unless
they
may
have
been
over
the
plains
in
their
journeys
to
and
from
the
pacific
coast
even
then
they
look
from
the
windows
of
the
pullman
car
on
to
the
desert
white
with
alkali
over
which
the
heat
rises
in
waves
and
upon
earth
that
struggles
to
give
even
life
to
the
hardy
cactus
or
then
i
find
their
attention
is
called
to
our
army
and
i
sometimes
hear
a
sympathetic
tone
in
their
voices
as
they
say
ah
custer
when
i
rode
over
that
land
i
began
to
see
what
none
of
us
at
the
east
ever
realize
the
terrible
life
that
our
army
leads
on
the
plains
and
only
lately
while
i
was
in
the
west
a
citizen
described
to
me
seeing
a
company
of
cavalry
that
had
made
a
terrific
march
come
in
to
the
railroad
at
some
point
in
arizona
he
told
me
of
their
blistered
faces
their
bloodshot
inflamed
eyes
the
result
of
the
constant
cloud
of
alkali
dust
through
which
they
marched
the
exhaustion
in
every
limb
so
noticeable
in
men
of
splendid
vigor
with
their
broad
chests
deep
throats
and
muscular
build
because
it
told
what
a
fearful
strain
it
must
have
been
to
have
reduced
such
stalwart
athletes
to
weakness
what
effect
it
would
have
to
introduce
a
body
of
such
indomitable
men
in
the
midst
of
an
eastern
city
tired
but
invincible
after
all
if
we
who
try
to
be
their
champions
should
succeed
in
making
this
transfer
by
some
act
of
necromancy
the
men
would
be
silent
about
their
sufferings
among
the
few
officers
who
have
written
of
plains
life
there
is
scarcely
a
mention
of
hardships
endured
as
i
read
over
my
husband
magazine
articles
for
the
first
time
in
many
years
i
find
scarcely
a
reference
to
the
scorching
sun
the
stinging
cold
the
bleak
winds
his
narrative
reads
like
the
story
of
men
who
marched
always
in
sunshine
coming
across
clear
streams
of
running
water
and
shady
woods
in
which
to
encamp
i
have
been
there
through
and
through
the
breezy
buoyant
tale
i
see
the
background
a
treeless
arid
plain
brackish
muddy
water
sandy
sterile
soil
the
faces
of
our
gallant
men
come
up
to
me
in
retrospection
blistered
and
swollen
the
eyes
streaming
with
moisture
from
the
inflaming
dust
the
parched
lips
cracked
with
fever
of
unquenched
thirst
the
hands
even
puffed
and
fiery
with
the
day
after
day
it
seems
heartless
to
smile
in
the
midst
of
this
vision
recalled
to
me
of
what
i
myself
have
seen
but
i
hear
some
civilian
say
as
they
have
often
asked
me
equally
inconsistent
questions
well
why
did
they
wear
gloves
where
all
the
possessions
of
a
man
are
carried
on
the
saddle
and
the
food
and
forage
on
it
would
be
impossible
to
take
along
gloves
to
last
from
early
spring
till
the
stinging
cold
of
late
autumn
thirst
is
an
unconquerable
foe
it
is
one
of
those
enemies
that
may
be
vanquished
on
one
field
and
come
up
supported
by
legions
of
fresh
desires
the
very
next
day
i
know
nothing
but
the
selfishness
of
our
natures
that
requires
such
persistent
fighting
just
fancy
for
a
moment
the
joy
of
reaching
a
river
or
a
stream
on
the
plains
how
easy
the
march
seemed
beside
its
banks
at
any
moment
one
could
descend
fill
the
canteen
and
rejoin
the
column
it
is
true
the
quality
of
the
water
was
not
of
the
best
but
there
comes
a
time
out
there
when
quantity
triumphs
it
seems
so
good
to
have
enough
of
for
the
stinted
supplies
of
all
sorts
make
life
seem
always
meagre
in
a
country
with
no
natural
resources
but
woe
be
to
the
man
who
puts
his
faith
in
a
western
stream
they
used
to
take
themselves
suddenly
out
of
sight
down
somewhere
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
and
leave
the
bed
dry
as
dust
winding
its
tortuous
way
for
miles
aggravating
us
by
the
constant
reminder
of
where
water
ought
to
be
but
where
it
unfortunately
was
not
this
sudden
disappearance
of
water
is
supposed
to
be
due
to
the
depression
of
the
rocky
beds
of
the
streams
a
deep
sand
absorbs
the
moisture
from
the
surface
and
draws
down
into
its
depths
all
the
stream
when
the
bed
again
rises
nearer
the
surface
the
stream
comes
to
sight
once
more
whoever
after
the
water
disappeared
found
that
he
must
drink
or
die
was
obliged
to
stop
and
dig
away
at
the
dry
bed
of
the
river
until
he
found
moisture
it
was
a
desperate
man
that
attempted
it
one
whose
throat
had
become
voiceless
whose
mouth
and
lips
ached
with
the
swelling
veins
of
overheated
blood
for
if
one
delayed
behind
the
column
for
ever
so
short
a
time
he
was
reminded
of
his
insecurity
by
a
flash
from
a
pile
of
stones
or
a
bunch
of
on
the
summit
of
a
low
divide
the
wily
foe
that
lurks
in
the
rear
of
a
marching
column
has
no
equal
in
vigilance
and
then
what
a
generous
being
a
soldier
is
how
often
i
have
seen
them
pass
the
precious
nectar
it
seemed
so
then
in
spite
of
its
being
warm
and
alkaline
and
i
speak
from
experience
for
they
have
given
me
a
chance
also
flavored
with
poor
whiskey
sometimes
as
that
old
tin
receptacle
which
government
furnishes
holds
coffee
whiskey
or
water
whichever
is
attainable
i
fear
that
had
i
scratched
and
dug
slowly
into
the
soil
with
the
point
of
a
sabre
and
scooped
up
a
minimum
of
water
my
eye
on
the
bluff
near
watching
and
in
fear
of
an
indian
i
should
have
remembered
my
own
parched
throat
and
let
the
whole
american
army
go
thirsty
but
i
am
thankful
to
say
the
soldier
is
made
of
different
stuff
it
is
enough
to
weld
strongest
bonds
of
friendship
like
those
in
our
army
when
it
is
share
and
share
alike
and
i
am
reminded
of
a
stanza
of
soldier
poetry
there
are
bonds
of
all
sorts
in
this
world
of
ours
fetters
of
friendship
and
ties
of
flowers
and
knots
i
ween
the
boy
and
the
girl
are
bound
by
a
kiss
but
there
never
a
bond
of
old
friends
like
this
we
have
drunk
from
the
same
canteen
i
have
among
our
plains
photographs
a
picture
of
one
of
the
western
rivers
with
no
sort
of
tree
or
green
thing
growing
on
its
banks
it
is
the
dreariest
picture
i
ever
saw
and
as
it
appears
among
the
old
photographs
of
merry
groups
taken
in
camp
or
on
porches
covered
with
our
garrison
family
it
gives
me
a
shudder
even
now
among
the
photographs
of
the
bright
side
of
our
life
this
is
the
skeleton
at
the
feast
which
comes
up
so
persistently
since
all
rivers
and
streams
in
the
states
are
fringed
with
trees
it
is
difficult
to
describe
how
strange
some
of
our
western
appeared
without
so
much
as
a
border
of
shrubs
or
reeds
in
looking
over
the
country
as
we
ascended
to
a
divide
higher
than
the
rest
the
stream
lay
before
us
winding
on
in
the
curving
lines
of
our
own
eastern
rivers
but
for
miles
and
miles
not
a
vestige
of
green
bordered
the
banks
it
seemed
to
me
for
all
the
world
like
an
eye
without
an
eyelash
it
was
strange
unnatural
weird
the
white
alkali
was
the
only
border
and
that
spread
on
into
the
scorched
brown
grass
too
short
to
protect
the
traveler
from
the
glare
that
was
heightened
by
the
sun
in
a
cloudless
sky
a
tree
was
often
a
landmark
and
was
mentioned
on
the
insufficient
maps
of
the
country
such
as
tree
a
name
telling
its
own
story
or
lone
tree
known
as
the
only
one
within
eighty
miles
as
was
the
one
in
dakota
where
so
many
indians
buried
their
dead
what
made
those
thirsty
marches
a
thousand
times
worse
was
the
alluring
aggravating
mirage
this
constantly
deceived
even
old
campaigners
and
produced
the
most
harrowing
sort
of
illusions
such
a
too
for
as
we
believed
ourselves
approaching
the
blessed
water
imagined
the
air
was
fresher
looked
eagerly
and
expectantly
for
the
brown
shriveled
grass
to
grow
green
off
floated
the
deluding
water
farther
and
farther
away
as
i
try
to
write
something
of
the
sacrifices
of
the
soldier
who
will
not
speak
of
himself
and
for
whom
so
few
have
spoken
there
comes
to
me
another
class
of
heroes
for
whom
my
husband
had
such
genuine
admiration
and
in
whose
behalf
he
gave
up
his
life
our
western
pioneer
a
desperate
sort
of
impatience
overcomes
me
when
i
realize
how
incapable
i
am
of
paying
them
proper
tribute
and
yet
how
fast
they
are
passing
away
with
no
historians
and
hordes
of
settlers
are
sweeping
into
the
western
states
and
territories
quite
unmindful
of
the
soldiers
and
frontiersmen
who
fought
step
by
step
to
make
room
for
the
coming
of
the
population
of
the
east
my
otherwise
charming
journeys
west
now
are
sometimes
marred
by
the
desire
i
feel
for
calling
the
attention
of
the
travelers
who
are
borne
by
steam
swiftly
over
the
plains
to
the
places
where
so
short
a
time
since
men
toilsomely
traveled
in
pursuit
of
homes
i
want
to
ask
those
who
journey
for
pleasure
or
for
a
new
home
if
they
realize
what
men
those
were
who
took
their
lives
in
their
hands
and
prepared
the
way
h
their
privations
are
forgotten
or
carelessly
ignored
by
those
who
now
go
in
and
possess
the
land
the
graphic
pens
of
bret
harte
and
others
who
have
written
of
the
frontier
arrest
the
attention
of
the
eastern
man
and
save
from
oblivion
some
of
the
noble
characters
of
those
early
days
still
these
poets
naturally
seized
for
portraiture
the
picturesque
romantic
characters
who
were
miners
or
scouts
the
isolated
instances
of
desperate
men
who
had
gone
west
from
love
of
adventure
or
because
of
some
tragic
history
in
the
states
that
drove
them
to
seek
forgetfulness
in
a
wild
unfettered
existence
beyond
the
pale
of
civilization
who
chronicles
the
patient
plodding
silent
pioneer
who
having
been
crowded
out
of
his
home
by
too
many
laborers
in
a
limited
field
or
because
he
could
no
longer
wring
subsistence
from
a
soil
too
long
tilled
by
sire
and
grandsire
or
possibly
a
returned
volunteer
from
our
war
who
finding
all
places
he
once
filled
closed
up
was
compelled
to
take
the
grant
of
land
that
the
government
gives
its
soldiers
and
begin
life
all
over
again
for
the
sake
of
wife
and
children
there
is
little
in
these
lives
to
arrest
the
poetical
fancy
of
those
writers
who
put
into
rhyme
which
is
the
most
lasting
of
all
history
the
lives
otherwise
lost
to
the
world
how
often
general
custer
rode
up
to
these
weary
plodding
yeomen
as
they
turned
aside
their
wagons
to
allow
the
column
of
cavalry
to
pass
he
was
interested
in
every
detail
of
their
lives
admired
their
indomitable
pluck
and
helped
them
if
he
could
in
their
difficult
journeys
sometimes
after
a
summer
of
hardships
and
every
sort
of
discouragement
we
met
the
same
people
returning
east
and
the
general
could
not
help
being
amused
at
the
grim
kind
of
humor
that
led
these
men
to
write
the
history
of
their
season
in
one
word
on
the
battered
cover
of
the
wagon
busted
we
were
in
kansas
during
all
the
grasshopper
scourge
when
our
government
had
to
issue
rations
to
the
starving
farmers
deprived
of
every
source
of
sustenance
what
a
marvel
that
men
had
the
courage
to
hold
out
at
all
in
those
exasperating
times
when
the
crops
were
no
sooner
up
than
every
vestige
of
green
would
be
stripped
from
the
fields
then
too
the
struggle
for
water
was
great
the
artesian
wells
that
now
cover
the
western
states
were
too
expensive
to
undertake
with
the
early
settlers
the
windmills
that
now
whirl
their
gay
wheels
at
every
zephyr
of
the
plains
and
water
vast
numbers
of
cattle
on
the
farms
were
then
unthought
of
a
settler
in
colorado
in
those
times
of
deprivation
and
struggle
wrote
his
history
on
a
board
and
set
it
up
on
the
trail
as
a
warning
to
others
coming
after
him
toughed
it
out
here
two
years
result
stock
on
hand
five
towheads
and
seven
yaller
dogs
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
down
to
water
fifty
miles
to
wood
and
grass
hell
all
around
god
bless
our
home
it
would
be
too
painful
to
attempt
to
enumerate
the
ravages
made
by
the
indians
on
the
pioneer
and
god
alone
knows
how
they
faced
life
at
all
working
their
claims
with
a
musket
beside
them
in
the
field
and
the
sickening
dread
of
returning
to
a
desolated
cabin
ever
present
in
their
heavy
hearts
there
are
those
i
occasionally
meet
who
went
through
innumerable
hardships
and
overcame
almost
insurmountable
obstacles
and
who
attained
to
distinction
in
that
land
of
the
setting
sun
but
i
find
they
only
remember
the
jovial
side
of
their
early
days
not
long
since
i
had
the
privilege
of
talking
with
the
governor
of
one
of
our
territories
he
was
having
an
interview
with
some
mexican
senators
by
means
of
an
interpreter
and
after
his
business
was
finished
he
turned
to
our
party
to
talk
with
enthusiasm
of
his
territory
no
youth
could
be
more
sanguine
than
he
over
the
prospects
the
climate
the
natural
advantages
of
the
new
country
in
which
he
had
just
cast
his
lines
all
his
reminiscences
of
his
early
days
in
other
territories
were
most
interesting
to
me
general
custer
was
such
an
enthusiast
over
our
glorious
west
that
i
early
learned
to
look
upon
much
that
i
would
not
otherwise
have
regarded
with
interest
with
his
buoyant
feeling
i
must
qualify
this
statement
and
explain
that
i
could
not
always
see
such
glowing
colors
as
did
he
while
we
suffered
from
climate
and
were
sighing
for
such
blessings
as
trees
and
water
but
we
were
both
heart
and
soul
with
every
immigrant
we
came
across
and
i
think
many
a
pioneer
went
on
his
way
after
encountering
my
husband
on
the
westward
trail
a
braver
and
more
hopeful
man
how
well
i
remember
the
long
wait
we
made
on
one
of
the
staircases
of
the
capitol
at
washington
above
which
hung
then
the
great
picture
by
leutze
westward
the
course
of
empire
takes
its
way
we
little
thought
then
hardly
more
than
girl
and
boy
as
we
were
that
our
lives
would
drift
over
the
country
which
the
admirable
picture
represents
the
general
hung
round
it
with
delight
and
noted
many
points
that
he
wanted
me
to
enjoy
with
him
the
picture
made
a
great
impression
on
us
how
much
deeper
the
impression
though
had
we
known
that
we
were
to
live
out
the
very
scenes
depicted
coming
back
to
the
governor
i
can
not
take
time
to
write
his
story
the
portion
of
the
interesting
hour
that
made
the
greatest
impression
on
me
was
his
saying
that
the
happiest
days
of
his
life
were
those
when
for
fifteen
hundred
miles
he
walked
beside
the
wagon
containing
his
wife
and
babies
and
drove
the
team
from
their
old
home
in
wisconsin
to
a
then
unsettled
portion
of
ohio
the
honors
that
had
come
to
him
as
senator
governor
statesman
faded
beside
the
joys
of
his
first
venture
from
home
into
the
wilderness
i
saw
him
in
imagination
as
i
have
often
seen
the
pioneer
looking
back
to
the
opening
made
in
the
front
of
the
wagon
by
the
drawing
over
of
the
canvas
cover
to
the
puckered
circle
in
which
were
framed
the
woman
and
babies
for
whom
he
could
do
and
dare
i
fall
to
wondering
if
there
is
any
affection
like
that
which
is
enhanced
or
born
of
these
sacrifices
in
each
other
behalf
i
wonder
if
there
can
be
anything
that
would
so
spur
a
man
to
do
heroic
deeds
as
the
feeling
that
he
walked
in
front
of
three
dependent
beings
and
braved
indians
starvation
floods
and
all
those
perils
that
beset
a
western
trail
and
to
see
the
bright
fond
eyes
of
a
mother
and
the
rosy
cheeks
of
the
little
ones
looking
uncomplainingly
out
upon
the
desert
before
them
why
what
could
nerve
a
man
arm
like
that
love
grows
with
every
sacrifice
and
i
believe
that
many
a
youthful
passion
that
might
have
become
colorless
with
time
has
been
deepened
into
lasting
affection
on
those
lonely
tramps
over
the
prairies
it
has
also
been
my
good
fortune
lately
to
recall
our
western
life
with
an
of
another
territory
a
friend
of
my
husband
in
those
kansas
days
what
can
i
say
in
admiration
of
the
pluck
of
those
western
men
even
in
the
midst
of
his
luxuriant
new
york
life
he
loves
better
to
dwell
on
the
early
days
of
his
checkered
career
when
at
seven
years
of
age
he
was
taken
by
his
parents
to
the
land
of
the
then
great
unknown
he
had
made
a
fortune
in
california
for
he
was
a
and
returned
east
to
enjoy
it
but
as
he
lost
his
all
soon
afterward
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
but
to
start
out
again
his
wife
could
have
remained
in
comfort
and
security
with
her
friends
but
she
preferred
to
share
the
danger
and
discomforts
of
her
husband
life
their
first
trip
over
the
old
trail
to
denver
our
afterward
was
a
journey
from
missouri
the
outfitting
place
at
the
termination
of
the
last
railway
going
west
taking
days
to
accomplish
the
wife
brave
as
she
was
fell
ill
and
lay
on
the
hard
the
whole
distance
the
invincible
father
took
entire
care
of
her
and
of
his
children
cooking
for
the
party
of
eleven
on
the
whole
route
and
did
guard
duty
a
portion
of
every
night
the
indians
were
hovering
in
front
and
in
rear
two
of
the
party
were
too
old
to
walk
and
carry
a
musket
so
that
on
the
five
men
devolved
the
guarding
of
their
little
train
nine
times
afterward
he
and
his
wife
crossed
that
long
stretch
of
country
before
the
railroad
was
completed
always
in
peril
and
never
knowing
from
hour
to
hour
when
a
band
of
hostiles
would
sweep
down
upon
them
he
taught
his
children
the
use
of
as
soon
as
they
were
large
enough
to
hold
a
pistol
his
daughter
learned
as
well
as
his
sons
to
be
an
accurate
marksman
and
shot
from
the
pony
back
when
he
scampered
at
full
speed
over
the
prairies
for
years
and
years
all
his
family
were
obliged
to
be
constantly
vigilant
they
lived
out
a
long
portion
of
their
lives
on
the
alert
for
a
foe
that
they
knew
well
how
to
dread
but
the
humorous
comes
in
even
in
the
midst
of
such
tragic
days
how
i
enjoyed
and
appreciated
the
feelings
of
the
governor
wife
whom
i
had
known
as
a
girl
when
she
rebelled
at
his
exercising
his
heretofore
valuable
accomplishment
as
cook
after
he
became
governor
how
like
a
woman
and
how
dear
such
whimsicalities
are
sandwiched
in
among
the
many
admirable
qualities
with
which
such
strong
characters
as
hers
are
endowed
it
seems
that
on
some
journey
over
the
plains
they
entertained
a
party
of
guests
the
entire
distance
the
cook
was
a
failure
and
as
the
route
of
travel
out
there
is
not
lined
with
the
only
thing
left
to
do
for
the
governor
rather
than
see
his
wife
so
taxed
was
to
doff
his
coat
and
recall
the
culinary
gifts
acquired
in
pioneer
life
the
madame
thought
her
husband
now
a
governor
might
keep
in
secrecy
his
gifts
at
getting
up
a
dinner
but
he
persisted
saying
that
it
was
still
a
question
whether
he
would
make
a
good
governor
and
as
he
was
pretty
certain
he
was
a
good
cook
he
thought
it
as
well
to
impress
that
one
gift
of
which
he
was
sure
upon
his
constituents
the
next
letter
from
the
expedition
brought
me
such
good
news
that
i
counted
all
the
frights
of
the
past
few
weeks
as
nothing
compared
with
the
opportunity
that
being
in
fort
riley
gave
me
of
joining
my
husband
he
wrote
that
the
cavalry
had
been
detached
from
the
main
body
of
the
command
and
ordered
to
scout
the
from
fort
hays
to
fort
mcpherson
then
the
most
invested
with
savages
a
camp
was
to
be
established
temporarily
and
scouting
parties
sent
out
from
fort
hays
to
my
joy
my
husband
said
in
his
letter
that
i
might
embrace
any
safe
opportunity
to
join
him
there
general
sherman
proved
to
be
the
direct
answer
to
my
prayers
for
he
arrived
soon
after
i
had
begun
to
look
confidently
for
a
chance
to
leave
for
fort
hays
with
the
grave
question
of
the
summer
campaign
in
his
mind
it
probably
did
not
occur
to
him
that
he
was
acting
as
the
envoy
extraordinary
of
divine
providence
to
a
very
anxious
lonely
woman
while
he
talked
with
me
occasionally
of
the
country
about
which
he
was
an
enthusiast
and
oh
how
his
predictions
of
its
prosperity
have
come
true
already
i
made
out
to
reply
coherently
but
i
kept
up
a
very
vehement
enthusiastic
set
of
inner
thoughts
and
grateful
ejaculations
blessing
him
for
every
breath
he
drew
blessing
and
thanking
providence
that
he
had
given
the
of
our
forces
a
heart
so
fresh
and
warm
he
could
feel
for
others
and
a
soul
so
loyal
and
affectionate
for
his
own
wife
and
family
that
he
knew
what
it
was
to
endure
suspense
and
separation
he
had
with
him
some
delightful
girls
whom
we
enjoyed
very
much
i
can
not
remember
whether
in
my
anxiety
to
go
to
my
husband
my
conversation
led
up
to
the
subject
doubtless
it
did
for
i
was
then
at
that
youthful
stage
of
existence
when
the
mouth
speaketh
out
of
the
fullness
of
the
heart
but
i
do
remember
that
the
heart
in
me
nearly
leaped
out
of
my
body
when
he
invited
me
to
go
in
his
car
to
fort
harker
for
the
railroad
had
been
completed
to
that
next
post
diana
crowded
what
of
her
apparel
she
could
into
her
trunk
and
i
had
a
valise
but
the
largest
part
of
our
luggage
was
a
roll
of
bedding
which
i
remember
blushing
over
as
it
was
handed
into
the
special
coach
for
there
was
no
it
looked
very
strange
to
see
such
an
ungainly
bundle
as
part
of
the
belongings
of
two
young
women
and
though
i
was
perfectly
willing
to
sleep
on
the
ground
in
camp
as
i
had
done
in
virginia
and
texas
i
did
not
wish
to
court
hardships
when
i
knew
a
way
to
avoid
them
though
we
went
over
a
most
interesting
country
general
sherman
did
not
seem
to
care
much
for
the
outside
world
he
sat
in
the
midst
of
us
and
entered
into
all
our
fun
told
stories
to
match
ours
joined
in
our
songs
and
was
the
grand
mogul
of
our
circle
one
of
the
young
girls
was
so
captivating
even
in
her
disloyalty
that
it
amused
us
all
immensely
when
we
sang
she
looked
silently
out
of
the
window
if
we
talked
of
the
danger
we
might
encounter
with
indians
general
sherman
said
slyly
he
would
make
her
departure
from
earth
as
easy
as
possible
for
he
would
honor
her
with
a
military
funeral
she
knew
that
she
must
in
such
a
case
be
wrapped
in
the
stars
and
stripes
and
he
did
not
neglect
to
tell
her
that
honor
awaited
her
if
she
died
but
she
vehemently
refused
the
honor
all
this
which
would
have
been
trying
from
a
grown
person
was
nothing
but
amusement
to
us
from
a
chit
of
a
girl
who
doubtless
took
her
coloring
as
the
creatures
of
that
age
do
from
her
latest
confederate
sweetheart
in
retrospection
i
like
to
think
of
the
tact
and
tolerance
of
general
sherman
in
those
days
of
furious
feeling
on
both
sides
and
the
quiet
manner
in
which
he
heard
the
southern
people
decry
the
yankees
he
knew
of
their
impoverished
and
desolated
homes
and
realized
living
among
them
as
he
did
in
louis
what
sacrifices
they
had
made
more
than
all
his
sympathetic
soul
saw
into
the
darkened
lives
of
mothers
wives
and
sisters
who
had
given
with
their
idea
of
patriotism
their
loved
ones
to
their
country
the
truth
is
he
was
back
again
among
those
people
of
whom
he
had
been
so
fond
and
no
turbulent
expressions
of
hatred
and
revenge
could
unsettle
the
underlying
affection
besides
he
has
always
been
a
man
who
keeps
in
front
in
our
progress
as
does
this
war
hero
is
he
not
a
statesman
as
well
as
a
soldier
and
never
have
the
interests
of
our
land
been
narrowed
down
to
any
prescribed
post
where
he
may
have
been
stationed
or
his
life
been
belittled
by
any
temporary
isolation
or
division
from
the
rest
of
mankind
every
public
scheme
for
our
advancement
as
a
nation
meets
his
enthusiastic
welcome
this
spirit
enabled
him
to
see
at
the
close
of
the
war
that
after
the
violence
of
wrath
should
have
subsided
the
south
would
find
themselves
more
prosperous
and
capable
in
the
new
order
of
affairs
of
immense
strides
in
progress
of
all
kinds
i
remember
a
southern
woman
who
came
to
stay
with
relatives
in
our
garrison
telling
me
of
her
first
encounter
with
general
sherman
after
the
war
he
had
been
a
valued
friend
for
many
years
but
it
was
too
much
when
on
his
return
to
louis
he
came
as
a
matter
of
course
to
see
his
old
friends
smarting
with
the
wrongs
of
her
beloved
south
she
would
not
even
send
a
message
by
the
maid
she
ran
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
in
an
excited
tone
asked
if
he
for
one
moment
expected
she
would
speak
so
much
as
speak
to
a
yankee
the
general
went
on
his
peaceful
way
as
unharmed
by
this
peppery
assault
as
a
foe
who
is
out
of
reach
of
our
government
carbines
and
i
can
recall
with
what
cordiality
she
came
to
greet
him
later
in
the
year
or
two
that
followed
no
one
could
maintain
wrath
long
against
such
imperturbable
as
general
sherman
exhibited
he
remembered
a
maxim
that
we
all
are
apt
to
forget
put
yourself
in
his
place
along
the
line
of
the
railroad
were
the
deserted
towns
and
we
even
saw
a
whole
village
moving
on
flat
cars
the
portable
houses
of
one
story
and
the
canvas
rolls
of
tents
which
would
soon
be
set
up
to
form
a
street
of
saloons
were
piled
up
as
high
as
was
safe
and
made
the
strangest
sort
of
freight
train
the
spots
from
which
they
had
been
removed
were
absolutely
the
dreariest
of
sights
a
few
poles
broken
kegs
short
chimneys
made
in
rude
masonry
of
small
round
stones
heaps
of
tin
cans
everywhere
broken
bottles
strewing
the
ground
while
great
square
holes
yawned
empty
where
a
short
time
before
a
canvas
roof
covered
a
room
stored
with
clumsy
shelves
laden
with
liquor
here
and
there
a
barrel
protruded
from
the
ground
they
were
the
chimneys
of
some
former
i
can
not
describe
how
startled
i
was
when
i
first
came
near
one
of
these
improvised
chimneys
and
saw
smoke
pouring
out
without
any
other
evidence
that
i
was
walking
over
the
home
of
a
frontier
citizen
the
roof
of
a
flat
is
level
with
the
earth
and
as
no
grass
consents
to
grow
in
these
temporary
villages
there
is
nothing
to
distinguish
the
upturned
soil
that
has
been
used
as
a
covering
for
the
beams
of
the
roof
of
a
dwelling
from
any
of
the
rest
of
the
immediate
vicinity
a
portion
of
this
moving
village
had
already
reached
the
end
in
the
railroad
and
named
itself
ellsworth
with
streets
called
by
various
appellations
but
marked
only
by
stakes
in
the
ground
at
fort
harker
we
found
a
forlorn
little
post
a
few
log
houses
bare
of
every
comfort
and
no
trees
to
cast
a
shade
on
the
low
roofs

bachelor
commanding

offered
to
general
sherman
and
his
party
we
five
women
had
one
of
the
only
two
rooms
it
seems
like
an
abuse
of
hospitality
even
after
all
these
years
to
say
that
the
floor
of
uneven
boards
was
almost
ready
for
agricultural
purposes
as
the
wind
had
sifted
the
prairie
sand
in
between
the
roughly
laid
logs
and
even
the
most
careful
housewife
would
have
found
herself
outwitted
if
she
had
tried
to
keep
a
tidy
floor
i
only
remember
it
because
i
was
so
amused
to
see
the
dainty
women
stepping
around
the
little
space
left
in
the
room
between
the
cots
to
find
a
place
to
kneel
and
say
their
prayers
i
had
given
up
and
gone
to
bed
as
often
before
i
had
been
compelled
to
tell
my
thanks
to
the
heavenly
father
on
my
pillow
for
already
in
the
marches
i
had
encountered
serious
obstacles
to
kneeling
the
perplexed
but
devout
women
finally
gave
up
attempting
a
devotional
attitude
turned
their
faces
to
the
rough
wall
and
held
their
rosaries
in
their
fingers
while
they
sent
up
orisons
for
protection
and
guidance
they
were
reverential
in
their
petitions
but
i
could
not
help
imagining
how
strange
it
must
seem
to
these
luxuriously
raised
girls
to
find
themselves
in
a
country
where
not
even
a
little
prayer
could
be
said
as
one
would
wish
it
must
have
been
for
exigencies
of
our
life
that
montgomery
wrote
the
comforting
definition
that
prayer
is
the
soul
sincere
desire
the
upward
lifting
of
an
eye
and
so
set
the
heart
at
rest
about
how
and
where
the
supplication
of
the
soul
could
be
offered

we
bade
to
our

the
frolic

departed
and
the
serious
side
of
existence
appeared
i
had
but
little
realization
that
every
foot
of
our
coming
march
of
eighty
miles
was
dangerous
we
had
an
ambulance
lent
us
and
accompanied
a
party
that
had
an
escort
there
were
every
ten
or
fifteen
miles
consisting
of
rude
log
or
stone
huts
huddled
together
for
safety
in
case
of
attack
the
stables
for
the
relays
of
horses
were
furnished
with
strong
doors
of
timber
and
the
windows
closed
with
shutters
of
similar
pattern
the
stablemen
and
relays
of
drivers
lived
in
no
better
quarters
than
the
horses
they
were
of
course
intrepid
men
and
there
was
no
stint
in
arming
them
with
good
rifles
and
abundance
of
ammunition
they
were
prepared
for
attack
and
could
have
defended
themselves

the
strong
doors

siege

kept
inside

quarters
had
not
the
indians
used
prepared
arrows
that
could
be
shot
into
the
hay
and
thus
set
the
stables
on
fire
these
plainsmen
all
had
as
places
of
retreat
in
case
of
fire
they
were
very
near
the
stables
and
connected
by
an
underground
passage
they
were
about
four
feet
deep
the
roof
was
of
timbers
strong
enough
to
hold
four
or
five
feet
of
earth
and
in
these
retreats
a
dozen
men
could
defend
themselves
by
firing
from
loopholes

were
left

short

were
all
the
evidence

the
dreary

here
these
men
lived
facing
death
every
hour
rather
than
earn
a
living
in
the
monotonous
pursuit
of
some
trade
or
commonplace
business
in
the
states
and
at
that
time
there
were
always
desperadoes
who
would
pursue
any
calling
that
kept
them
beyond
the
reach
of
the
law
this
dreary
eighty
miles
over

monotonous

only
by
the
undulations

was
lined
with

meant

and
counting

it
seemed
to
me
the

of
all
the
troubles
that
would
ever
enter
into
my
life
had
come
when
i
was
lifted
out
of
the

into
my

tent
what
a
blessing
it
is
that
there
is
a
halcyon
time
in
sanguine
youth
when
each
difficulty
vanquished
seems
absolutely
the
last
that
will
ever
come

when
one

stone
is
rolled
against

sepulchre
with
the
conviction

nothing

we
had
much
to
talk
about
in
camp
the
first
campaign
of
a
regiment
is
always
important
to
them
and
in
this
case
also
the
council
the
indian
village
and
its
final
destruction
were
really
significant
events
a
match
hunt
they
had
carried
out
was
a
subject
of
interest
and
each
side
took
one
ear
in
turn
to
explain
why
they
won
or
the
reasons
they
lost

davis
the
artist
whom
the
harpers
sent
out
for
the
summer
was
drawing
sketches
in
our
tent
while
we
advised
or
commented
it
seemed
well
from
the
discussions
that
followed
that
rules
for
the
hunt
had
been
drawn
up
in
advance
it
was
quite
a
ranking
affair
when
two
full
majors
conducted
the
sides
as
only
one
day
was
given
to
each
side
the
one
remaining
in
camp
watched
vigilantly
that
the
party
going
out
held
to
the
rule
and
refrained
from
starting
till
sunrise
while
the
same
jealous
eyes
noticed
that
sunset
saw
all
of
them
in
camp
again
one
of
the
rules
was
that
no
shots
should
be
counted
that
were
fired
when
the
man
was
dismounted
this
alone
was
a
hard
task
as
at
that
time
the
splendid
racing
of
the
horse
at
breakneck
speed
with
his
bridle
free
on
his
neck
and
both
hands
busy
with
the
gun
was
not
an
accomplished
feat
the
horses
were
all
novices
at
also
and
the
game
was
thin
at
that
season
so
thin
that
a
bison
got
over
a
great
deal
of
territory
in
a
short
time
i
remember
the
general
telling
me
what
an
art
it
was
even
after
the
game
was
shot
to
learn
to
cut
out
the
tongue
it
was
wonderful
that
there
was
such
success
with
so
much
to
encounter
the
winning
party
kept
their
twelve
tongues
very
securely
hidden
until
the
second
day
when
the
losers
produced
the
eleven
they
had
supposed
would
not
be
outdone
my
husband
was
greatly
amused
at
one
of
our
officers
who
hovered
about
the
of
the
opposite
party
and
craftily
put
questions
to
ascertain
what
was
the
result
of
the
first
day
illustration
supper
given
by
the
vanquished

all
this

glee
diana
interests
were
centred
in
the
success
of
that
party
with
whom
her
best
beloved
for
the
time
hunted
the
officers
regretted
our
absence
at
their
great
feed
as
they
termed
it
and
it
must
indeed
have
been
a
great
treat
to
have
for
once
in
that
starving
summer
something
palatable
two
were
put
together
so
that
the
table
made
of
rough
boards
stretching
through
both
was
large
enough
for
all
victors
and
vanquished
toasted
each
other
in
champagne
and
though
the
scene
was
the
plainest
order
of
banquet
lighted
by
tallow
candles
set
in
rude
brackets
sawed
out
of
boards
and
fastened
to

the
only
draping

up
many
a
dreary
day

gallant
captain
louis
mclane
hamilton
who
afterward
fell
in
the
battle
of
the
washita
was
the
hero
of
the
hour
and
bore
his
honors
with
his
usual
modesty
four
out
of
twelve
buffaloes
was
a
record
that
might
have
set
a
less
boastful
tongue
wagging
over
the
confidences
of
the
evening
i
do
not
think
he
would
have
permitted
davis
to
put
his
picture
in
the
illustration
if
he
could
have
helped
it
he
was
gifted
with
his
pencil
also
he
drew
caricatures
admirably
and
after
a
harmless
laugh
had
gone
the
rounds
he
managed
with
the
utmost
adroitness
to
get
possession
of
the
picture
and
destroy
it
thus
taking
away
the
sting
of
ridicule
which
constant
sight
of
the
caricature
might
produce
how
i
came
into
possession
of
one
little
drawing
is
still
a
mystery
but
it
is
very
clever
among
our
officers
was
one
who
had
crossed
the
plains
as
a
citizen
a
year
or
two
previous
and
his
habit
of
revealing
mines
of
frontier
lore
obtained
on
this
one
trip
was
somewhat
tiresome
to
our
still
inexperienced
officers
at
last
after
all
had
tried
chasing
antelope
and
been
more
and
more
impressed
in
their
failures
with
the
fleetness
of
that
winged
animal
captain
hamilton
made
a
sketch
representing
the
boaster
as
shooting
antelope
with
the
the
speck
on
the
horizon
was
all
that
was
seen
of
the
game
but
the
booted
and
spurred
man
kneeling
on
the
prairie
was
admirable
it
silenced
one
of
the
stories
certainly
and
we
often
wished
the
pencil
could
protect
us
further
from
subsequent
statements
airily
made
on
the
strength
of
the
one
i
had
arrived
in
the
rainy
season
and
such
an
emptying
of
the
heavens
was
a
further
development
of
what
kansas
could
do
but
nothing
damped
my
ardor
no
amount
of
soakings
could
make
me
think
that
was
not
an
elysian
field
the
general
had
made
our
tent
as
comfortable
as
possible
with
his
few
belongings
and
the
officers
had
sent
in
to
him
for
me
any
comfort
that
they
might
have
chanced
to
bring
along
on
the
march
i
was
it
seemed
to
be
especially
honored
with
a
display
of
what
the
elements
could
do
at
night
when
it
was
too
dark
to
grope
about
and
protect
our
tent
the
wind
blew
a
tornado
and
the
flashes
of
lightning
illumined
the
tent
and
revealed
the
pole
swaying
ominously
back
and
forth
a
fly
is
an
outer
strip
of
canvas
which
is
stretched
over
the
tent
to
prevent
the
rain
from
penetrating
as
well
as
to
protect
us
in
the
daytime
from
the
sun
this
flapped
and
rattled
and
swung
loose
at
one
end
beating
on
the
canvas
roof
like
a
for
it
was
loaded
with
moisture
and
the
wet
ropes
attached
to
it
and
used
to
guy
it
down
were
now
loose
and
lashed
our
rag
house
in
an
angry
vindictive
manner
my
husband
accustomed
to
the
pyrotechnic
display
of
the
elements
slept
soundly
through
the
early
part
of
the
storm
but
lightning
murders
sleep
with
me
and
consequently
he
was
awakened
by
a
conjugal
joggle
and
on
asking
what
is
it
was
informed
it
lightens
often
as
this
statement
was
made
to
him
in
his
sudden
awakenings
i
do
not
remember
his
ever
meeting
it
with
any
but
a
teasing
laughing
reply
like
ah
indeed
i
am
pleased
to
be
informed
of
so
important
a
fact
this
news
is
quite
unexpected
and
so
on
or
when
may
i
inquire
did
you
learn
this
on
this
occasion
however
there
was
no
attempt
to
quiet
me
or
delay
precautions
feeling
sure
that
we
were
in
for
it
for
the
night
he
unfastened
the
straps
that
secured
the
tent
in
front
and
crept
out
to
hammer
down
the
and
tether
the
ropes
but
it
was
of
no
earthly
use
after
fruitless
efforts
of
his
own
he
called
the
guard
from
their
tents
and
they
went
energetically
to
work
with
the
light
of
our
lantern
ropes
wrenched
themselves
away
from
the
straps
broke
whole
corners
of
the
tent
were
torn
out
even
while
the
men
were
hanging
with
all
their
might
to
the
upright
poles
to
try
and
keep
the
steady
and
clinging
to
the
ropes
to
keep
them
from
loosening
entirely
and
sailing
off
in
the
air
with
the
canvas
in
the
midst
of
this
fracas
with
the
shouts
of
the
soldiers
calling
to
one
another
in
the
inky
darkness
the
crash
of
thunder
and
the
howling
of
the
tempest
the
wife
of
a
brave
soldier
was
hiding
her
head
under
the
blankets
and
not
one
sound
emerged
from
this
temporary
retreat
the
great
joy
of
getting
out
to
camp
at
last
was
too
fresh
to
extract
one
word
one
whimper
of
fear
from
under
the
bedding
the
sunniest
day
at
fort
riley
could
not
be
exchanged
could
not
even
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
with
that
tornado
of
wind
and
rain
the
stalwart
arms
of
the
soldiers
failed
at
last
their
brawny
chests
were
of
no
more
use
thrust
against
the
than
so
many
needles
over
went
the
canvas
in
a
heap
the
general
and
his
men
hanging
on
to
the
to
clear
it
from
the
camp
bed
and
save
any
accident
the
voices
of
officers
in
an
adjoining
tent
called
out
to
come
over
to
them
one
half
dressed
groped
his
way
to
us
and
said
there
was
yet
room
for
more
in
his
place
and
besides
he
had
a
floor
it
was
a
sibley
which
having
no
corners
with
which
those
kansas
breezes
can
toy
is
much
more
secure
i
was
rolled
in
the
blankets
and
carried
through
the
blinding
rain
to
our
hospitable
neighbors
the
end
of
a
tallow
dip
gave
me
a
glimpse
only
of
many
silent
forms
rolled
in
blankets
and
radiating
from
the
centre
like
the
spokes
of
a
wagon
wheel
the
officer
owning
this
tent
had
taken
the
precaution
while
at
leavenworth
to
have
a
floor
made
in
sections
so
that
it
could
be
easily
stowed
away
in
the
bottom
of
a
in
marching
my
husband
laid
me
down
and
we
were
soon
two
more
spokes
in
the
human
wheel
and
asleep
in
a
trice
next
morning
i
wakened
to
find
myself
alone
with
a
tin
basin
of
water
and
a
towel
for
my
toilet
beside
me
my
husband
had
to
dress
me
in
his
underclothing
for
everything
i
had
was
soaked
my
shoes
were
hopeless
so
i
was
dropped
into
a
pair
of
cavalry
boots
and
in
this
unpicturesque
costume
which
i
covered
as
best
i
could
with
my
wet
dress
i
was
carried
through
the
mud
to
the
and
enthroned
turk
on
a
board
which
the
cook
produced
from
some
where
he
had
kept
it
for
kindlings
there
were
not
a
few
repetitions
of
this
stormy
reception
in
the
years
that
followed
for
kansas
continued
its
weather
vagaries
with
unceasing
persistency
but
this
being
my
first
is
as
fresh
in
my
mind
as
if
it
occurred
but
yesterday
the
tent
might
go
down
nightly
for
all
i
cared
then
every
thought
of
separation
departed
and
i
gave
myself
up
to
the
happiest
hours
clamping
about
the
tent
in
those
old
troop
boots
indifferent
whether
my
shoes
dried
the
hours
flew
too
fast
though
for
very
soon
preparations
began
for
a
scout
which
my
husband
was
to
command
it
took
a
great
deal
of
comforting
to
reconcile
me
to
remaining
behind
the
general
as
usual
had
to
beg
me
to
remember
how
blessed
we
were
to
have
been
permitted
to
rejoin
each
other
so
early
in
the
summer
he
told
me
over
and
over
again
that
there
was
nothing
he
felt
that
i
would
not
encounter
to
come
to
him
and
that
if
he
was
detained
he
would
send
for
me
eliza
and
a
faithful
soldier
were
to
be
left
to
care
for
us
the
cavalry
departed
and
again
the
days
lengthened
out
longer
and
longer
until
each
one
seemed
hours
from
sun
to
sun
we
could
scarcely
take
a
short
walk
in
safety
the
indians
were
all
about
us
and
daily
the
sentinels
were
driven
in
or
attempts
were
made
to
stampede
the
horses
and
mules
grazing
about
the
post
the
few
officers
remaining
in
whose
care
we
were
placed
came
or
sent
every
day
to
our
tents
which
were
up
the
creek
a
short
distance
to
inquire
what
they
could
do
for
our
comfort
gibbs
with
her
boys
had
joined
her
husband
and
we
were
their
neighbors
it
seemed
sometimes
as
if
we
get
outside
of
our
prescribed
limits
the
rolling
bluffs
beyond
tinged
with
green
and
beginning
to
have
prairie
flowers
looked
so
tempting
one
evening
we
beguiled
an
officer
who
was
sitting
under
our
tent
fly
which
was
stretched
in
front
for
a
shade
to
take
us
for
a
little
walk
like
many
another
man
in
the
temporary
possession
of
wheedling
women
he
went
with
us
a
little
and
just
a
little
farther
diana
would
have
driven
all
thought
of
everything
else
save
herself
out
of
the
gravest
head
at
last
our
escort
saw
the
dark
coming
on
so
fast
he
insisted
upon
going
home
and
we
reluctantly
turned
as
we
came
toward
the
post
the
shadows
were
deepening
in
the
twilight
and
the
figures
of
the
sentinels
were
not
visible
a
flash
followed
by
a
sound
past
our
ears
that
old
campaigners
describe
as
never
to
be
forgotten
when
first
heard
was
the
warning
that
we
three
were
taken
for
indians
and
fired
upon
by
the
sentinel
another
flash
but
we
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
stunned
by
surprise
the
whizz
and
zip
of
the
bullet
seemed
to
be
only
a
few
inches
from
my
ear
still
we
were
dazed
and
had
not
the
officer
gained
his
senses
our
fate
would
have
been
then
and
there
decided
the
recruit
probably
himself
terrified
kept
on
sending
those
deadly
little
missives
with
the
terrible
sound
cutting
the
air
around
us
our
escort
shouted
but
it
was
too
far
for
his
voice
to
carry
then
he
told
us
to
run
for
our
lives
to
a
slight
depression
in
the
ground
and
throw
ourselves
on
our
faces
i
was
coward
enough
to
burrow
mine
in
the
and
for
once
in
my
life
was
devoutly
grateful
for
being
slender
still
as
i
lay
there
quaking
with
terror
my
body
seemed
to
rise
above
the
earth
in
such
a
monstrous
heap
that
the
dullest
marksman
if
he
tried
might
easily
perforate
me
with
bullets
what
ages
it
seemed
while
we
waited
in
this
prostrate
position
commanded
by
our
escort
not
to
move
the
rain
of
bullets
at
last
ceased
and
blessed
quiet
came
but
not
peace
of
mind
the
officer
told
us
he
would
creep
on
his
hands
and
knees
through
the
hollow
portions
of
the
plain
about
the
post
approach
by
the
creek
side
and
inform
the
sentinels
along
the
line
and
as
soon
as
they
all
knew
who
we
were
he
would
return
for
us
with
smothered
voices
issuing
from
the
grass
where
our
faces
were
still
crushed
as
low
as
we
could
get
them
we
implored
to
be
allowed
to
creep
on
with
him
we
prayed
him
not
to
leave
us
out
in
the
darkness
alone
we
begged
him
to
tell
us
how
he
could
ever
find
us
again
if
once
he
left
us
on
ground
that
had
no
distinctive
features
by
which
he
could
trace
his
way
back
but
he
was
adamant
we
must
remain
and
the
ring
of
authority
in
his
tone
besides
the
culprit
feeling
we
had
for
having
endangered
his
life
kept
us
still
at
last
as
we
lay
there
our
hearts
thumping
seemed
to
lift
us
up
in
air
and
imperil
anew
our
wretched
existence
the
pretty
rounded
contour
of
the
girl
which
she
had
naturally
taken
such
delight
in
was
now
a
source
of
agony
to
her
and
she
moaned
out
oh
how
high
i
seem
to
be
above
you
oh
libbie
do
you
think
i
lie
as
flat
to
the
ground
as
you
do
and
so
on
with
all
the
foolish
talk
of
frightened
women
when
at
last
our
deliverer
came
my
relief
at
such
an
escape
was
almost
forgotten
in
the
mortification
i
felt
at
having
made
so
much
trouble
and
i
thought
with
chagrin
how
quickly
the
general
gratitude
to
find
we
had
escaped
the
bullets
would
be
followed
by
temporary
suspension
of
faith
regarding
my
following
out
his
instructions
not
to
run
risks
of
danger
and
wander
away
from
the
post
i
wrote
him
an
abject
account
of
our
hazardous
performance
i
renewed
every
promise
i
asked
to
be
trusted
again
and
from
that
time
there
were
no
more
walks
outside
the
beat
of
the
sentinel
an
intense
disappointment
awaited
me
at
this
time
and
took
away
the
one
hope
that
had
kept
up
my
spirits
i
was
watching
from
day
to
day
an
opportunity
to
go
to
my
husband
at
fort
mcpherson
for
he
had
said
i
could
come
if
any
chance
offered
i
was
so
lonely
and
anxious
i
would
gladly
have
gone
with
the
scout
who
took
despatches
and
mail
though
he
had
to
travel
at
night
and
lie
in
the
ravines
all
day
to
elude
the
sharp
eyes
of
the
indians
i
remember
watching
wild
bill
as
he
reported
at
the
commanding
officer
tent
to
get
despatches
for
my
husband
and
wishing
with
all
my
heart
that
i
could
go
with
him
i
know
this
must
seem
strange
to
people
in
the
states
whose
ideas
of
scouts
are
made
up
from
stories
of
shooting
affrays
gambling
lynching
and
outlawry
i
should
have
felt
myself
safe
to
go
any
distance
with
those
men
whom
my
husband
employed
as
bearers
of
despatches
i
have
never
known
women
treated
with
such
reverence
as
those
whom
they
honored
they
were
touched
to
see
us
out
there
for
they
measured
well
every
danger
of
that
country
and
the
class
that
followed
the
moving
railroad
towns
were
their
only
idea
of
women
except
as
they
caught
glimpses
of
us
in
camp
or
on
the
march
in
those
as
we
were
sometimes
compelled
to
walk
a
short
distance
from
the
depot
to
our
ambulance
the
rough
characters
in
whom
people
had
ceased
to
look
for
good
were
transformed
in
their
very
attitude
as
we
approached
of
course
they
all
knew
and
sincerely
admired
the
general
and
removing
their
hats
they
stepped
off
the
walk
and
cast
such
looks
at
me
as
if
i
had
been
little
lower
than
the
angels
when
these
men
so
looked
at
me
my
husband
was
as
proud
as
if
a
president
had
manifested
pleasure
at
sight
of
his
wife
and
amused
himself
immensely
because
i
said
to
him
after
we
were
well
by
that
the
outlaws
had
seemed
to
think
me
possessed
of
every
good
attribute
while
to
myself
my
faults
and
deficiencies
appeared
to
rise
mountains
high
i
felt
that
if
there
was
a
christian
grace
that
my
mother
had
not
striven
to
implant
in
me
i
would
cultivate
it
now
and
try
to
live
up
to
the
frontier
citizen
impression
of
us
as
women
i
think
the
general
would
have
put
me
in
the
care
of
any
scout
that
served
him
just
as
readily
as
to
place
me
in
the
keeping
of
the
best
officer
we
had
there
was
not
a
trust
he
reposed
in
them
that
they
did
not
fulfill
oh
how
hard
it
was
for
me
to
see
them
at
that
time
when
starting
with
despatches
to
my
husband
swing
themselves
into
the
saddle
and
disappear
over
the
divide
i
feel
certain
with
such
an
end
in
view
as
i
had
and
with
the
good
health
that
the
toughening
of
our
campaigns
had
given
me
i
could
have
ridden
all
night
and
slept
on
the
in
the
ravines
daytimes
for
a
great
distance
had
i
been
given
the
opportunity
to
join
my
husband
by
putting
myself
in
their
charge
there
would
not
have
been
one
moment
hesitation
on
my
part
i
knew
well
that
when
off
duty
the
scout
is
often
in
affrays
where
lynching
and
outlawry
are
events
of
the
western
towns
but
that
had
no
effect
upon
these
men
sense
of
honor
when
an
officer
had
reposed
a
trust
in
them
wild
bill
california
joe
buffalo
bill
comstock
charlie
reynolds
and
a
group
of
intrepid
men
besides
who
from
time
to
time
served
under
my
husband
would
have
defended
any
of
us
women
put
in
their
charge
with
their
lives
i
remember
with
distinctness
what
genuine
admiration
and
gratitude
filled
my
heart
as
these
intrepid
men
rode
up
to
my
husband
tent
to
receive
orders
and
despatches
from
my
woman
standpoint
it
required
far
more
and
a
vastly
higher
order
of
courage
to
undertake
their
journeys
than
to
charge
in
battle
with
women
every
duty
or
task
seems
easier
when
shared
by
others
the
most
cowardly
of
us
might
be
so
impressionable
so
sympathetic
in
a
great
cause
that
we
saw
others
preparing
to
defend
that
it
would
become
our
own
and
it
is
not
improbable
that
enthusiasm
might
take
even
a
timid
woman
into
battle
excited
and
incited
by
the
daring
of
others
the
bray
of
drums
the
clash
of
arms
the
call
of
the
trumpet
but
i
doubt
if
there
are
many
who
could
go
off
on
a
scout
of
hundreds
of
miles
and
face
death
alone
it
still
seems
to
me
supreme
courage
imagine
then
my
gratitude
my
genuine
admiration
when
my
husband
sent
scouts
with
letters
to
us
and
we
saw
them
in
returning
swing
lightly
into
the
saddle
and
gallop
off
apparently
unconcerned
freighted
with
our
messages
of
affection
something
better
than
such
a
journey
awaited
me
it
seemed
when
two
of
our
seventh
cavalry
officers
captain
samuel
robbins
and
colonel
william
cook
appeared
in
camp
at
the
head
of
a
detachment
of
cavalry
and
a
small
train
of
wagons
for
supplies
the
general
had
told
them
to
bring
me
back
and
an
ambulance
was
with
the
wagons
in
which
i
was
to
ride
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
put
our
roll
of
bedding
and
my
valise
in
order
and
to
say
anything
about
the
heart
in
me
leaping
for
joy
is
even
a
tame
expression
to
describe
the
delight
that
ran
through
every
vein
in
my
body
to
ascend
such
heights
of
joy
means
a
corresponding
capability
of
descent
into
a
region
of
suffering
about
which
i
do
not
even
now
like
to
think
for
the
memory
of
my
disappointment
has
not
departed
after
all
these
years
the
commanding
officer
of
the
department
was
at
the
post
temporarily
and
forbade
my
going
there
is
a
hateful
clause
in
the
army
regulations
which
gives
him
control
of
all
as
well
as
troops
i
ran
the
whole
gamut
of
insubordination
mutiny
and
revolt
as
i
threw
myself
alone
on
the
little
of
our
tent
this
stormy
rebellious
season
fought
out
by
myself
ended
of
course
as
everything
must
that
gives
itself
into
military
jurisdiction
as
i
was
left
behind
in
spite
of
myself
but
i
might
have
been
enlisted
as
a
soldier
for
five
years
and
not
have
been
more
helpless
i
put
my
fingers
into
my
ears
not
to
hear
the
call
boots
and
saddles
as
the
troops
mounted
and
rode
away
i
only
felt
one
relief
the
officers
would
tell
the
general
that
nothing
but
the
command
forbidding
them
to
take
me
had
prevented
my
doing
what
he
knew
i
would
do
if
it
was
in
my
power
i
had
time
also
to
use
my
husband
as
a
and
pour
out
my
vials
of
wrath
against
the
officer
detaining
me
in
a
long
letter
filling
pages
with
regret
that
i
was
prevented
going
to
him
the
indians
were
then
at
their
worst
they
roamed
up
and
down
the
route
of
travel
burning
the
stations
running
off
stock
and
attacking
the
stages
general
hancock
had
given
up
all
aggressive
measures
the
plan
was
to
defend
the
route
taken
for
supplies
and
protect
the
stage
company
property
so
far
as
possible
the
railroad
building
was
almost
entirely
abandoned
as
our
officers
and
their
detachment
were
for
a
time
allowed
to
proceed
quietly
on
their
march
to
mcpherson
they
rather
flattered
themselves
they
would
see
nothing
of
the
enemy
still
every
eye
watched
the
long
ravines
that
intersect
the
plains
and
form
such
fastnesses
for
the
wily
foe
there
is
so
little
to
prepare
you
for
these
cuts
in
the
smooth
surface
of
the
plain
that
an
unguarded
traveler
comes
almost
upon
a
deep
fissure
in
the
earth
before
dreaming
that
the
lay
of
the
land
was
not
all
the
seeming
level
that
stretches
on
to
sunset
these
ravines
have
small
clumps
of
sturdy
trees
kept
alive
in
the
drought
of
that
arid
climate
by
the
slight
moisture
from
what
is
often
a
buried
stream
at
the
base
the
indians
know
them
by
heart
and
not
only
lie
in
wait
in
them
but
escape
by
these
gullies
that
often
run
on
growing
deeper
and
deeper
till
the
bed
of
a
river
is
reached
in
one
of
these
ravines
six
hundred
savages
in
full
were
in
ambush
awaiting
the
train
of
supplies
and
sprang
out
from
their
with
horrible
yells
as
our
detachment
of
less
than
fifty
men
approached
neither
officer
lost
his
head
at
a
sight
that
was
then
new
to
him
their
courage
was
inborn
they
directed
the
troops
to
form
a
circle
about
the
wagons
and
in
this
way
the
little
band
of
valiant
men
defended
themselves
against
attack
after
attack
not
a
soldier
flinched
nor
did
a
teamster
lose
control
of
his
mules
though
the
effort
to
stampede
them
was
incessant
this
running
fight
lasted
for
three
hours
when
suddenly
the
indians
withdrew
they
with
their
experienced
eyes
first
saw
the
reinforcements
coming
to
the
relief
of
our
brave
fellows
and
gave
up
the
attack
the
first
time
i
saw
colonel
cook
after
this
affair
he
said
the
moment
i
found
the
indians
were
on
us
and
we
were
in
for
a
fight
i
thought
of
you
and
said
to
myself
she
were
in
the
ambulance
before
giving
an
order
i
would
ride
up
and
shoot
her
would
you
have
given
me
no
chance
for
life
i
replied
in
case
the
battle
had
gone
in
your
favor
not
one
he
said
i
should
have
been
unnerved
by
the
thought
of
the
fate
that
awaited
you
and
i
have
promised
the
general
not
to
take
any
chances
but
to
kill
you
before
anything
worse
could
happen
already
in
these
early
days
of
the
regiment
history
the
accounts
of
indian
atrocities
perpetrated
on
the
women
of
the
frontier
ranches
had
curdled
the
blood
of
our
men
and
over
the
at
night
when
these
stories
were
discussed
my
husband
had
said
to
the
officers
that
he
should
take
every
opportunity
to
have
me
with
him
but
there
was
but
one
course
he
wished
pursued
if
i
was
put
in
charge
of
any
one
in
the
regiment
he
asked
them
to
kill
me
if
indians
should
attack
the
camp
or
the
escort
on
the
march
i
have
referred
in
general
terms
to
this
understanding
but
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
the
seriousness
with
which
the
general
request
was
considered
by
his
brother
officers
first
came
home
to
me
footnote
h
my
father
went
to
michigan
early
in
and
his
long
journey
was
made
by
stage
and
schooner
he
was
not
only
a
great
while
in
making
the
trip
but
subject
to
privations
illness
and
fatigue
even
when
using
the
only
means
of
travel
in
those
early
days
the
man
who
went
over
the
old
california
trail
fared
far
worse
his
life
was
in
peril
from
indians
all
the
distance
besides
his
having
to
endure
innumerable
hardships

chapter
xvii
a
flood
at
fort
hays
before
general
custer
left
for
fort
mcpherson
he
removed
our
tents
to
a
portion
of
that
branch
of
big
creek
on
which
the
post
was
established
he
selected
the
highest
ground
he
could
find
knowing
that
the
rainy
season
was
not
yet
over
and
hoping
that
if
the
camp
were
on
a
knoll
the
ground
would
drain
readily
and
dry
quickly
after
a
storm
we
were
not
a
great
distance
from
the
main
stream
and
the
fort
but
still
too
far
to
recognize
anyone
that
might
be
walking
in
garrison
the
stream
on
which
we
were
located
was
tortuous
and
on
a
bend
above
us
the
colonel
commanding
his
adjutant
and
his
escort
were
established
between
us
and
the
fort
general
and
gibbs
were
camped
while
the
tents
of
a
few
officers
on
detached
duty
were
still
farther
on
the
sentinel
beat
was
along
a
line
between
us
and
the
high
ground
where
the
indians
were
likely
to
steal
upon
us
from
the
bluffs
this
guard
walked
his
tour
of
duty
on
a
line
parallel
with
the
stream
but
was
too
far
from
it
to
observe
the
water
closely
each
little
group
of
tents
made
quite
a
show
of
canvas
as
we
had
abundance
of
room
to
spread
out
and
the
quartermaster
was
not
obliged
to
limit
us
to
any
given
number
of
tents
we
had
a
hospital
tent
for
our
with
a
pitched
behind
and
opening
out
of
the
larger
one
for
our
bedroom
there
was
a
for
the
kitchen
near
and
behind
us
the
a
tent
for
the
soldier
whom
the
general
had
left
to
take
care
of
us
in
his
absence
we
were
as
safely
placed
as
to
indians
as
was
possible
in
such
a
country
as
is
the
custom
in
military
life
the
officers
either
came
every
day
or
sent
to
know
if
i
could
think
of
anything
they
could
do
for
my
comfort
the
general
had
thought
of
everything
and
besides
i
did
my
best
not
to
have
any
wants
i
was
as
capable
of
manufacturing
needs
as
anyone
and
could
readily
trump
up
a
collection
in
garrison
but
i
was
rendered
too
wary
by
the
uncertainty
of
my
tenure
of
that
to
me
valuable
little
strip
of
ground
that
held
my
canvas
house
to
allow
my
presence
to
be
brought
home
to
those
gallant
men
as
a
trouble
or
a
responsibility
the
idea
that
i
might
have
to
retreat
eastward
was
a
terror
and
kept
in
subjection
any
passing
wish
i
might
indulge
to
have
anything
done
for
me
i
would
gladly
have
descended
into
one
of
the
habitations
that
were
so
common
in
kansas
then
and
had
my
food
handed
down
to
me
if
this
would
have
enabled
the
officers
to
forget
that
i
was
there
until
the
expedition
returned
from
the
platte
yet
the
elements
were
against
me
and
did
their
best
to
interfere
with
my
desire
to
obliterate
myself
as
far
as
being
an
anxiety
to
others
was
concerned
one
night
we
had
retired
and
were
trying
to
believe
that
the
thunder
was
but
one
of
those
peculiar
menacing
volleys
of
that
sometimes
passed
over
harmlessly
but
we
could
not
sleep
the
roar
and
roll
of
thunder
was
so
alarming
there
is
no
describing
lightning
on
the
plains
while
a
storm
lasts
there
seems
to
be
an
incessant
glare
to
be
sure
there
is
not
the
smallest
flash
that
does
not
illumine
the
tent
and
there
is
no
way
of
hiding
from
the
blinding
light
in
a
letter
written
to
my
husband
while
the
effect
of
the
fright
was
still
fresh
on
my
mind
i
told
him
the
heavens
seemed
to
shower
down
fire
upon
the
earth
and
in
one
minute
and
a
half
we
counted
distinct
peals
of
thunder
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
for
us
to
do
but
to
lie
quaking
and
terrified
under
the
covers
the
tents
of
the
officers
were
placed
at
some
distance
from
ours
intentionally
as
it
is
impossible
to
speak
low
enough
under
canvas
to
avoid
being
heard
unless
a
certain
space
intervenes
it
is
the
custom
to
allow
a
good
deal
of
ground
to
intervene
if
the
guard
is
so
posted
as
to
command
the
approach
to
all
the
tents
the
result
was
that
we
dared
not
venture
to
try
to
reach
a
neighbor
we
simply
had
to
endure
the
situation
as
no
cry
could
be
heard
above
the
din
of
the
constantly
increasing
storm
in
the
midst
of
this
quaking
and
misery
the
voice
of
some
officers
outside
called
to
ask
if
we
were
afraid
finding
that
the
storm
was
advancing
to
a
tornado
they
had
decided
to
return
to
us
and
render
assistance
if
they
could
or
at
least
to
quiet
our
fears
the
very
sound
of
their
voices
calmed
us
and
we
dressed
and
went
into
the
outer
tent
to
admit
them
the
entrance
had
been
made
secure
by
leather
straps
and
buckles
that
the
general
had
the
saddler
put
on
and
in
order
to
strengthen
the
tents
against
these
hurricanes
which
we
had
already
learned
were
so
violent
and
sudden
he
had
ordered
poles
at
each
corner
sunk
deep
into
the
ground
these
being
notched
had
saplings
laid
across
either
side
and
to
these
the
were
bound
we
were
thus
seemingly
secured
between
two
barriers
he
even
went
further
in
his
precautions
and
fastened
a
which
is
a
small
cable
of
itself
to
either
end
of
the
stretching
it
at
the
front
and
rear
and
fasting
it
with
an
iron
pin
driven
into
the
ground
as
we
opened
two
or
three
of
the
straps
to
admit
the
officers
and
eliza
who
always
overcame
every
obstacle
to
get
to
me
in
danger
the
wind
drove
in
a
sheet
of
rain
upon
us
and
we
found
it
difficult
to
strap
the
opening
again
as
for
the
and
those
that
tied
the
tent
at
the
sides
all
this
creaking
loosening
cordage
proved
how
little
we
could
count
upon
its
stability
the
great
tarpaulin
of
the
heaviest
canvas
made
which
was
spread
over
our
larger
tent
and
out
in
the
front
for
a
porch
flapped
wildly
lashing
our
poor
little
rag
house
as
if
in
a
fury
of
rage
indeed
the
whole
canvas
seemed
as
if
it
might
have
been
a
cambric
handkerchief
for
the
manner
in
which
it
was
wrenched
and
twisted
above
and
on
all
sides
of
us
the
tallow
candle
was
only
kept
lighted
by
surrounding
it
with
boxes
to
protect
its
feeble
flame
from
the
wind
the
rain
descended
in
such
sheets
driven
by
the
hurricane
that
it
even
pressed
in
the
and
in
spite
of
the
trenches
that
every
good
campaigner
digs
about
the
tent
we
were
almost
inundated
by
the
streams
that
entered
under
the
lower
edge
of
the
walls
the
officers
finding
we
were
sure
to
be
drenched
began
to
fortify
us
for
the
night
they
feared
the
tent
would
go
down
and
that
the
of
a
being
so
much
larger
than
that
of
a
would
do
some
fatal
injury
to
us
they
piled
all
the
available
furniture
in
a
hollow
square
leaving
a
little
space
for
us
fortunately
some
one
coming
down
from
the
post
a
few
days
before
had
observed
that
we
had
no
table
there
was
no
lumber
at
the
post
and
the
next
best
thing
was
to
send
us
a
board
which
had
first
served
for
a
stove
secondly
with
the
addition
of
rude
supports
as
our
table
and
now
did
duty
in
its
third
existence
as
a
for
the
ground
was
softening
with
the
moisture
and
we
could
not
protect
our
feet
except
for
the
narrow
platform
on
which
we
huddled
at
last
the
booming
of
the
thunder
seemed
to
abate
somewhat
though
the
wind
still
shrieked
and
roared
over
the
wide
plain
as
it
bore
down
upon
our
frail
shelter
but
the
tent
though
swaying
and
threatening
to
break
from
its
moorings
had
been
true
to
us
through
what
we
supposed
to
be
the
worst
of
the
tempest
and
we
began
to
put
some
confidence
in
the
cordage
and
the
officers
decided
to
return
to
their
tents
promising
to
come
again
should
there
be
need
and
we
reluctantly
permitted
them
to
go
eliza
put
down
something
on
which
we
could
step
over
the
pools
into
the
other
tent
and
we
fell
into
bed
exhausted
with
terror
and
excitement
hardly
noticing
how
wet
and
cold
we
and
the
blankets
were
hardly
had
we
fallen
into
a
doze
when
the
voice
of
the
guard
at
the
entrance
called
out
to
us
to
get
up
and
make
haste
for
our
lives
the
flood
was
already
there
we
were
so
agitated
that
it
was
difficult
even
to
find
the
clothes
that
we
had
put
under
the
pillow
to
keep
them
from
further
soaking
much
more
to
get
into
them
it
was
then
impossible
to
remain
inside
of
the
tent
we
crept
through
the
opening
and
to
our
horror
the
lightning
revealed
the
creek
which
we
had
last
seen
the
night
before
a
little
rill
in
the
bottom
of
the
gully
now
on
a
level
with
the
high
banks
the
tops
of
trees
which
fringed
the
stream
were
barely
visible
as
the
current
swayed
the
branches
in
its
onward
sweep
the
water
had
risen
in
that
comparatively
short
time
feet
and
was
then
creeping
into
the
kitchen
tent
which
as
usual
was
pitched
near
the
bank
i
believe
no
one
attempted
to
account
for
those
terrific
rises
in
the
streams
except
as
partly
due
to
which
were
common
in
the
early
days
of
kansas
i
have
seen
the
general
hold
his
watch
in
his
hand
after
the
bursting
of
a
and
keep
reckoning
for
the
soldier
who
was
measuring
with
a
stick
at
the
stream
bed
and
for
a
time
it
recorded
an
inch
a
minute
of
course
the
camp
was
instantly
astir
after
the
alarm
of
the
guard
but
the
rise
of
the
water
is
so
insidious
often
that
a
sentinel
walking
his
beat
a
few
yards
away
will
sometimes
be
unconscious
of
it
until
the
danger
is
upon
the
troops
the
soldiers
our
own
man
detailed
as
striker
and
eliza
were
not
so
stampeded
as
they
expressed
it
as
to
forget
our
property
almost
everything
that
we
possessed
in
the
world
was
there
much
of
our
property
being
fortunately
still
boxed
i
had
come
out
to
camp
with
a
valise
but
the
afterward
brought
most
of
our
things
as
we
supposed
we
had
left
fort
riley
forever
the
soldiers
worked
like
beavers
to
get
everything
they
could
farther
from
the
water
upon
a
little
rise
of
ground
at
one
side
of
our
tents
eliza
the
coolest
of
all
took
command
and
we
each
carried
what
we
could
forgetting
the
lightning
in
our
excitement
the
officers
who
had
come
to
us
in
the
early
part
of
the
tempest
now
returned
they
found
their
own
camp
unapproachable
the
group
of
tents
having
been
pitched
on
a
bend
in
the
crooked
stream
which
had
the
advantage
of
the
circle
of
trees
that
edged
the
water
was
now
found
to
be
in
the
worst
possible
locality
as
the
torrent
had
swept
over
the
narrow
strip
of
earth
and
left
the
camp
on
a
newly
made
island
perfectly
inaccessible
the
lives
of
the
men
and
horses
stranded
on
this
little
spot
were
in
imminent
peril
the
officers
believed
us
when
we
said
we
would
do
what
we
could
to
care
for
ourselves
if
they
would
go
at
once
as
they
had
set
out
to
do
and
find
succor
for
the
soldiers
it
was
a
boon
to
have
something
that
it
was
necessary
to
do
which
kept
us
from
absolute
abandonment
to
terror
we
hardly
dared
look
toward
the
rushing
torrent
the
agony
of
seeing
the
water
steal
nearer
and
nearer
our
tent
was
almost
unendurable
as
we
made
our
way
from
the
heap
of
household
belongings
back
and
forth
to
the
tent
carrying
burdens
that
we
could
not
even
have
lifted
in
calmer
moments
the
lightning
became
more
vivid
and
the
whole
arc
above
us
seemed
aflame
we
were
aghast
at
what
the
brilliant
light
revealed
between
the
bluffs
that
rose
gradually
from
the
stream
and
the
place
where
we
were
on
its
banks
a
wide
newly
made
river
spread
over
land
that
had
been
perfectly
dry
and
as
far
as
any
one
knew
had
never
been
inundated
before
the
water
had
overflowed
the
banks
of
the
stream
above
us
and
swept
across
the
slight
depression
that
intervened
between
our
ground
and
the
hills
we
were
left
on
that
narrow
neck
of
land
and
the
water
on
either
side
of
us
seen
in
the
lightning
glare
appeared
like
two
boundless
seas
the
creek
had
broken
over
its
banks
and
divided
us
from
the
post
below
while
the
garrison
found
themselves
on
an
island
also
as
the
water
took
a
new
course
down
there
and
cut
them
off
from
the
bluffs
this
was
a
misfortune
to
us
as
we
had
so
small
a
number
of
men
and
sorely
needed
what
help
the
post
could
have
offered
while
we
ran
hither
and
thither
startled
at
the
shouts
of
the
officers
and
men
as
they
called
to
one
another
dreading
some
new
terror
our
hearts
sinking
with
uncontrollable
fright
at
the
wild
havoc
the
storm
was
making
the
two
dogs
that
the
general
valued
turk
the
and
rover
his
favorite
broke
their
chains
and
flew
at
each
other
throat
their
warfare
had
been
long
and
bloody
and
they
meant
that
night
to
end
the
contest
the
ferocity
of
the
was
not
greater
than
that
of
the
old
hound
the
soldiers
sprang
at
them
again
and
again
to
separate
them
the
fangs
of
each
showed
partly
buried
in
the
other
throat
but
finally
one
powerful
man
choked
the
into
relaxing
his
hold
the
remnants
of
the
gashed
and
bleeding
contestants
were
again
tied
at
a
secure
distance
and
the
soldiers
renewed
their
work
to
prevent
the
tents
from
falling
i
remember
that
in
one
gale
especially
furious
seventeen
clung
to
the
in
front
and
saved
the
canvas
from
downfall
but
after
all
something
worse
awaited
us
than
all
this
fury
of
the
elements
and
the
dread
of
worse
to
come
to
ourselves
for
the
reality
of
the
worst
that
can
come
to
anyone
was
then
before
us
without
a
warning
there
rang
out
on
the
air
piercing
our
ears
even
in
the
uproar
of
the
tempest
sounds
that
no
one
once
hearing
ever
forgets
they
were
the
despairing
cries
of
drowning
men
in
an
instant
our
danger
was
forgotten
but
the
officers
and
men
were
scattered
along
the
stream
beyond
our
call
and
eliza
was
now
completely
unnerved
we
ran
up
and
down
the
bank
wringing
our
hands
she
calling
to
me
oh
miss
libbie
what
shall
we
do
what
shall
we
do
we
tried
to
scream
to
those
dark
forms
hurrying
by
us
that
help
might
come
farther
down
alas
the
current
grew
more
furious
as
the
branch
poured
into
the
main
stream
and
we
could
distinguish
by
the
glare
of
the
lightning
the
men
waving
their
arms
imploringly
as
they
were
swept
down
with
masses
of
earth
and
heaps
of
rubbish
that
the
current
was
drifting
by
we
were
helpless
to
attempt
their
rescue
there
can
be
few
moments
in
existence
that
hold
such
agonizing
suffering
as
those
where
one
is
appealed
to
for
life
and
is
powerless
to
give
succor
i
thought
of
the
ropes
about
our
tent
and
ran
to
unwind
one
but
they
were
lashed
to
the
poles
stiff
with
moisture
and
tied
with
sailors
intricate
knots
in
a
frenzy
i
tugged
at
the
fastenings
bruising
my
hands
and
tearing
the
nails
the
were
equally
unavailable
for
no
knife
we
had
could
cut
such
a
cable
eliza
beside
herself
with
grief
to
think
she
could
not
help
the
dying
soldiers
with
whom
she
had
been
such
a
favorite
came
running
to
me
where
i
was
insanely
struggling
with
the
cordage
and
cried
miss
libbie
there
a
chance
for
us
with
one
man
he
caught
in
the
branches
of
a
tree
but
i
seen
his
face
and
he
alive
he
most
all
of
him
under
water
and
the
current
is
him
about
so
he
ca
hold
out
long
miss
libbie
there
my
we
take
but
i
ca
do
it
i
ca
do
it
miss
libbie
you
would
have
me
to
do
it
would
you
for
where
will
we
get
another
the
grand
humanity
that
illumined
the
woman
face
full
of
the
nobility
of
desire
to
save
life
was
so
interwoven
with
frugality
and
her
inveterate
habit
of
protecting
our
things
that
i
hardly
know
how
the
controversy
in
her
own
mind
would
have
ended
if
i
had
not
flown
to
the
kitchen
tent
to
get
the
the
current
swayed
the
drowning
man
so
violently
he
was
afraid
to
loosen
his
hold
of
the
branches
to
reach
the
rope
as
we
threw
it
to
him
over
and
over
again
and
it
seemed
momentarily
that
he
must
be
torn
from
our
sight
the
hue
of
death
was
on
his
face
that
terrible
blue
look
while
the
features
were
pinched
with
suffering
and
the
eyes
starting
from
their
sockets
he
was
naked
to
the
waist
and
the
chill
of
the
water
and
of
those
hours
that
come
before
dawn
had
almost
benumbed
the
fingers
that
clutched
the
branches
eliza
like
me
has
forgotten
nothing
that
happened
during
that
horrible
night
and
i
give
part
of
her
story
the
details
of
which
it
is
so
difficult
for
me
to
recall
with
calmness
miss
libbie
do
you
mind
when
we
took
the
an
went
near
to
him
as
we
could
get
he
did
seem
to
understan
what
we
was
up
to
we
made
a
loop
and
showed
it
to
him
when
a
big
flash
of
lightnin
came
and
made
a
glare
and
tried
to
call
to
him
to
put
it
over
his
head
the
noise
of
the
water
and
the
crashin
of
the
logs
that
was
comin
down
beside
the
thunder
drownded
out
our
voices
well
we
worked
half
an
hour
over
that
man
he
thought
you
and
me
miss
libbie
could
pull
him
in
that
we
was
strong
enough
he
seemed
kind
o
and
the
only
way
i
made
him
know
what
the
loop
was
for
i
put
it
on
over
my
body
and
made
signs
even
then
he
was
so
swept
under
that
part
of
the
bank
and
it
was
so
dark
i
did
think
we
could
get
him
i
could
hear
him
bubblin
bellowin
drownin
and
gaggin
well
we
pulled
him
in
at
last
though
i
got
up
to
my
waist
in
water
he
was
cold
and
blue
his
teeth
chatterin
he
just
shuck
and
shuck
and
his
eyes
was
perfectly
wild
we
had
to
help
him
for
he
could
hardly
walk
to
the
cook
tent
i
poured
hot
coffee
down
him
and
miss
libbie
you
tore
aroun
in
the
dark
and
found
your
way
to
the
next
tent
for
whisky
and
the
lady
that
never
was
known
to
keep
any
before
had
some
then
and
i
wrapped
the
drownded
man
in
the
blouse
the
ginnel
give
me
it
was
cold
and
i
was
wet
and
i
needed
it
miss
libbie
but
did
that
man
as
soon
as
ever
his
teeth
stopped
jest
get
up
and
walk
off
with
it
and
miss
libbie
the
ginnel
wrote
to
you
after
that
from
some
expedition
that
he
had
seen
the
soldier
eliza
gave
her
to
save
and
he
sent
his
thanks
and
asked
how
i
was
and
said
i
had
saved
his
life
i
just
sent
back
word
in
the
next
letter
you
wrote
the
ginnel
to
ask
if
that
man
said
anything
about
my
blouse
he
wore
off
that
night
you
gave
one
of
the
ginnel
blue
shirts
to
a
drownded
man
we
saved
two
more
and
wrapped
in
blankets
and
you
rubbed
with
red
pepper
and
kept
the
fire
and
talked
to
them
tryin
to
get
the
shiver
and
the
scare
out
of
i
tell
you
miss
libbie
we
made
a
fight
for
their
lives
if
ever
any
one
did
the
did
it
all
one
was
washed
near
to
our
tent
and
i
grabbed
his
hand
we
went
with
our
lanterns
and
it
was
so
dark
we
every
moment
to
step
into
a
watery
grave
for
the
water
was
so
near
us
and
the
flashes
of
lightnin
would
show
that
it
was
on
and
on
turk
and
rover
would
fight
just
by
looking
at
each
other
and
in
all
that
mess
they
fell
on
each
other
an
i
was
sure
they
was
goin
to
kill
each
other
and
oh
my
the
ginnel
would
have
taken
on
so
about
it
but
the
soldiers
dragged
them
apart
seven
men
were
drowned
near
our
tent
and
their
agonizing
cries
when
they
were
too
far
out
in
the
current
for
us
to
throw
our
line
are
sounds
that
will
never
be
stilled
the
men
were
from
the
escort
on
the
temporary
island
above
us
the
cavalrymen
attempted
as
the
waters
rose
about
them
to
swim
their
horses
to
the
other
shore
but
all
were
lost
who
plunged
in
for
the
violence
of
the
current
made
swimming
an
impossibility
a
few
negro
soldiers
belonging
to
the
infantry
were
compelled
to
remain
where
they
were
though
the
water
stood
three
feet
in
some
of
the
tents
when
the
violence
of
the
storm
had
abated
a
little
one
of
the
officers
swam
the
narrowest
part
of
the
stream
and
taking
a
made
a
ferry
so
that
with
the
help
of
soldiers
that
he
had
left
behind
holding
one
end
of
the
rope
he
had
taken
over
the
remaining
soldiers
were
rescued
and
brought
down
to
our
little
strip
of
land
alas
this
narrowed
and
narrowed
until
we
all
appeared
to
be
doomed
the
officers
felt
their
helplessness
when
they
realized
that
four
women
looked
to
them
for
protection
they
thought
over
every
imaginable
plan
it
was
impossible
to
cross
the
inundated
part
of
the
plain
though
their
horses
were
saddled
with
the
thought
that
each
one
might
swim
with
us
through
the
shallowest
of
the
water
they
rode
into
this
stretch
of
impassable
prairie
but
the
water
was
too
swift
even
then
to
render
it
anything
but
perilous
they
decided
that
if
the
water
continued
to
rise
with
the
same
rapidity
we
would
be
washed
away
as
we
could
not
swim
nor
had
we
strength
to
cling
to
anything
this
determined
them
to
resort
to
a
plan
that
happily
we
knew
nothing
of
until
the
danger
was
passed
we
were
to
be
strapped
to
the
gatling
guns
as
an
anchorage
these
are
perhaps
the
lightest
of
all
artillery
but
might
have
been
heavy
enough
to
resist
the
action
of
what
current
rose
over
our
island
there
would
have
been
one
chance
in
ten
thousand
of
rescue
under
such
circumstances
but
i
doubt
if
being
pinioned
there
watching
the
waves
closing
around
us
would
have
been
as
merciful
as
permitting
us
to
float
off
into
a
quicker
death
while
the
officers
and
men
with
us
were
working
with
all
their
might
to
save
lives
and
property
the
little
post
was
beleaguered
the
flood
came
so
unexpectedly
that
the
first
known
of
it
was
the
breaking
in
of
the
doors
of
the
quarters
the
poorly
built
leaky
insecure
adobe
houses
had
been
heretofore
a
protection
but
the
freshet
filled
them
almost
instantly
with
water
the
quarters
of
the
laundresses
were
especially
endangered
being
on
even
lower
ground
than
the
officers
houses
the
women
were
hurried
out
in
their
clasping
their
crying
children
while
they
ran
to
places
pointed
out
by
the
officers
to
await
orders
even
then
one
of
our
seventh
cavalry
officers
who
happened
to
be
temporarily
at
the
garrison
clambered
up
to
the
roof
of
an
adobe
house
to
discover
whether
the
women
of
his
regiment
were
in
peril
the
same
plan
for
rescue
was
adopted
at
the
post
that
had
been
partly
successful
above
a
ferry
was
improvised
out
of
a
and
into
this
were
collected
the
women
and
children
the
post
was
thus
emptied
in
time
to
prevent
loss
of
life
first
the
women
then
the
sick
from
the
hospital
and
finally
the
drunken
men
for
the
hospital
liquor
was
broken
into
and
it
takes
but
a
short
time
to
make
a
soldier
helplessly
drunk
the
government
property
had
to
be
temporarily
abandoned
and
a
great
deal
was
destroyed
or
swept
away
by
the
water
it
was
well
that
the
camp
women
were
inured
to
hardship
for
the
condition
in
which
the
cold
wet
frightened
creatures
landed
without
any
protection
from
the
storm
on
the
opposite
bank
was
pitiful
one
laundress
had
no
screams
of
terror
or
groans
of
suffering
over
physical
fright
her
wails
were
loud
and
continuous
because
her
savings
had
been
left
in
the
quarters
and
facing
death
in
that
frail
box
as
she
was
pulled
through
the
turbid
flood
was
nothing
to
the
pecuniary
loss
it
was
all
the
men
could
do
to
keep
her
from
springing
into
the
to
return
and
search
for
her
money
on
still
another
branch
of
big
creek
there
was
another
body
of
men
wrestling
with
wind
and
wave
several
companies
marching
to
new
mexico
had
encamped
for
the
night
and
the
freshet
came
as
suddenly
upon
them
as
upon
all
of
us
the
colonel
in
command
had
to
seize
his
wife
and
wade
up
to
his
arms
in
carrying
her
to
a
safe
place
even
then
they
were
warned
that
the
safety
was
but
temporary
the
ambulance
was
harnessed
up
and
they
drove
through
water
that
almost
swept
them
away
before
they
reached
higher
ground
there
was
a
strange
coincidence
about
the
death
eventually
of
this
officer
wife
a
year
afterward
they
were
encamped
on
a
texas
stream
with
similar
high
banks
betokening
freshets
and
the
waters
rose
suddenly
compelling
them
to
take
flight
in
the
ambulance
again
but
this
time
the
wagon
was
overturned
by
the
current
and
the
poor
woman
was
drowned
when
the
day
dawned
we
were
surrounded
by
water
and
the
havoc
about
us
was
dreadful
but
what
a
relief
it
was
to
have
the
rain
cease
and
feel
the
comfort
of
daylight
eliza
broke
up
her
bunk
to
make
a
fire
and
we
had
breakfast
for
everybody
owing
to
her
the
water
began
to
subside
and
the
place
looked
like
a
vast
laundry
all
the
camp
was
flying
with
blankets
bedding
and
clothes
we
were
drenched
of
course
having
no
dry
shoes
even
to
replace
those
in
which
we
had
raced
about
in
the
mud
during
the
night
but
these
were
small
inconveniences
compared
with
the
agony
of
terror
that
the
night
had
brought
as
the
morning
advanced
and
the
stream
fell
constantly
we
were
horrified
by
the
sight
of
a
soldier
swollen
beyond
all
recognition
whose
drowned
body
was
imbedded
in
the
side
of
the
bank
where
no
one
could
reach
it
and
where
we
could
not
escape
the
sight
of
it
he
was
one
who
had
implored
us
to
save
him
and
our
failure
to
do
so
seemed
even
more
terrible
than
the
night
before
as
we
could
not
keep
our
fascinated
gaze
from
the
stiffened
arm
that
seemed
to
have
been
stretched
out
entreatingly
though
we
were
thankful
for
our
deliverance
the
day
was
a
depressing
one
for
the
horror
of
the
drowning
men
near
us
could
not
be
put
out
of
our
minds
as
night
came
on
again
the
clouds
began
to
look
ominous
it
was
murky
and
it
rained
a
little
illustration
a
buffalo
undecided
as
to
an
attack
on
general
custer
at
dark
word
came
from
the
fort
to
which
some
of
the
officers
had
returned
that
we
must
attempt
to
get
to
the
high
ground
as
the
main
stream
big
creek
was
again
rising
all
the
officers
were
alarmed
they
kept
measuring
the
advance
of
the
stream
themselves
and
guards
were
stationed
at
intervals
to
note
the
rise
of
the
water
and
report
its
progress
the
they
held
were
like
tiny
so
dark
was
the
night
an
ambulance
was
driven
to
our
tent
to
make
the
attempt
to
cross
the
water
which
had
abated
there
slightly
and
if
possible
to
reach
the
divide
beyond
one
of
the
officers
went
in
advance
on
horseback
to
try
the
depth
of
the
water
it
was
a
failure
and
the
others
forbade
our
going
thinking
it
would
be
suicidal
while
they
were
arguing
diana
and
i
were
wrapping
ourselves
in
what
outside
garments
we
had
in
the
tent
she
had
been
plucky
through
the
terrible
night
writing
next
morning
to
the
general
that
she
never
wished
herself
for
one
moment
at
home
and
that
even
with
such
a
fright
she
could
never
repay
us
for
bringing
her
out
to
a
life
she
liked
so
much
yet
as
we
tremblingly
put
on
our
outside
things
she
began
to
be
agitated
over
a
subject
so
ridiculous
in
such
a
solemn
and
dangerous
hour
that
i
could
not
keep
my
face
from
what
might
have
been
a
smile
under
less
serious
circumstances
her
trepidation
was
about
her
clothes
she
asked
me
anxiously
what
she
should
do
for
dresses
next
day
and
insisted
that
she
must
take
her
small
trunk
in
vain
i
argued
that
we
had
nowhere
to
go
we
could
but
sit
in
the
ambulance
till
dawn
even
if
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
escape
to
the
bluff
she
still
persisted
saying
what
if
we
should
reach
a
fort
and
i
was
obliged
to
appear
in
the
gown
i
now
wear
i
asked
her
to
remember
that
the
next
fort
was
eighty
miles
distant
with
enough
water
between
it
and
us
to
float
a
ship
not
to
mention
roving
bands
of
indians
lying
in
wait
but
this
by
no
means
quieted
her
solicitude
about
her
appearance
at
last
i
suggested
her
putting
on
three
dresses
one
over
the
other
and
then
taking
in
the
little
trunk
from
which
she
could
not
part
the
most
necessary
garments
and
gowns
when
i
went
out
to
get
into
the
wagon
after
the
other
officers
had
left
and
found
our
one
escort
determined
still
to
venture
i
was
obliged
to
explain
that
diana
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
part
with
her
trunk
he
was
astounded
that
at
such
an
hour
in
such
a
dangerous
situation
clothes
should
ever
enter
anyone
head
but
the
trunk
appeared
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
to
verify
my
words
he
argued
that
with
a
wagon
loaded
with
several
people
it
would
be
perilous
to
add
unnecessary
weight
in
driving
through
such
ground
then
with
all
his
chivalry
working
night
and
day
to
help
us
there
came
an
instant
when
he
could
no
longer
do
justice
to
the
occasion
in
our
presence
so
he
stalked
off
to
one
side
and
what
he
said
to
himself
was
lost
in
the
growl
of
the
thunder
the
trunk
was
secured
in
the
ambulance
and
diana
eliza
and
i
followed
there
we
sat
getting
wetter
more
frightened
and
less
plucky
as
the
time
rolled
on
again
were
we
forbidden
to
attempt
this
mode
of
escape
and
condemned
to
return
to
the
tent
which
was
vibrating
in
the
wind
and
menacing
a
downfall
no
woman
ever
wished
more
ardently
for
a
front
than
i
longed
for
a
any
hole
in
the
side
of
a
bank
would
have
been
a
palace
to
me
living
as
i
did
in
momentary
expectation
of
no
covering
at
all
the
rarest
most
valuable
of
homes
meant
to
me
something
that
could
not
blow
away
those
women
who
take
refuge
in
these
days
in
their
cyclone
cellar
now
the
popular
architecture
of
the
west
will
know
well
how
comforting
it
is
to
possess
something
that
can
not
be
readily
lifted
up
and
deposited
in
a
neighboring
county
with
the
approach
of
midnight
there
was
again
an
abatement
in
the
rain
and
the
water
of
the
stream
ceased
to
creep
toward
us
so
the
officers
gaining
some
confidence
in
its
final
subsidence
again
left
us
to
go
to
their
tents
for
three
days
the
clouds
and
thunder
threatened
but
at
last
the
sun
appeared
in
a
letter
to
my
husband
dated
june
i
wrote
when
the
sun
came
out
yesterday
we
could
almost
have
worshipped
it
like
the
heathen
we
have
had
some
dreadful
days
and
had
not
all
the
officers
been
so
kind
to
us
i
do
not
know
how
we
could
have
endured
what
we
have
even
some
whom
we
do
not
know
have
shown
the
greatest
solicitude
in
our
behalf
we
are
drenching
wet
still
and
everything
we
have
is
soggy
with
moisture
last
evening
after
two
sleepless
nights
gibbs
and
her
two
boys
alphie
and
blair
diana
and
i
were
driven
across
the
plain
from
which
the
water
is
fast
disappearing
to
the
coveted
divide
beyond
it
is
not
much
higher
as
you
know
than
the
spot
where
our
tents
are
but
it
looked
like
a
mountain
as
we
watched
it
while
the
water
rose
all
around
us
some
of
the
officers
had
tents
pitched
there
and
we
women
were
given
the
sibley
tent
with
the
floor
that
sheltered
me
in
the
other
storm
we
dropped
down
in
heaps
we
were
so
exhausted
for
want
of
sleep
and
it
was
such
a
relief
to
know
that
at
last
the
water
could
not
reach
us
the
letter
continued
from
day
to
day
as
no
scouts
were
sent
out
described
the
moving
of
the
camp
to
more
secure
ground
it
was
incessant
motion
for
no
place
was
wholly
satisfactory
to
the
officers
i
confessed
that
i
was
a
good
deal
unnerved
by
the
frights
that
every
sound
startled
me
and
a
shout
from
a
soldier
stopped
my
breathing
almost
so
afraid
was
i
that
it
was
the
alarm
of
another
freshet
while
the
clouds
were
never
more
closely
watched
than
at
that
time
a
fresh
trouble
awaited
me
for
general
hancock
came
to
camp
from
harker
and
brought
bad
news
the
letter
continues
the
dangers
and
terrors
of
the
last
few
days
are
nothing
compared
with
the
information
that
general
hancock
brings
it
came
near
being
the
last
proverbial
i
was
indeed
when
i
found
that
our
schemes
for
being
together
soon
were
so
ruthlessly
crushed
general
hancock
says
that
it
looks
as
if
you
would
be
in
the
department
of
the
platte
for
several
months
at
which
he
is
justly
indignant
but
he
is
promised
your
return
before
the
summer
is
ended
he
thinks
that
if
i
want
to
go
so
badly
i
may
manage
to
make
you
a
flying
visit
up
there
and
this
is
all
that
keeps
me
up
the
summer
here
so
far
separated
from
you
seems
to
stretch
out
like
an
arid
desert
if
there
were
the
faintest
shadow
of
a
chance
that
i
would
see
you
here
again
i
would
not
go
as
we
are
ordered
to
i
will
come
back
here
again
if
i
think
there
is
the
faintest
prospect
of
seeing
you
if
you
say
so
i
will
go
to
fort
mcpherson
on
the
cars
if
i
get
the
ghost
of
an
opportunity
eliza
in
ending
her
recollections
of
the
flood
at
fort
hays
says
well
miss
libbie
when
the
water
rose
so
and
the
men
was
i
said
to
myself
in
the
night
if
god
spared
me
that
would
be
the
last
of
war
for
me
but
when
the
waters
went
down
and
the
sun
came
out
then
we
began
to
cheer
each
other
up
and
were
willing
to
go
right
on
from
there
if
we
could
for
we
wanted
to
see
the
ginnel
so
bad
but
who
would
have
thought
that
the
stream
would
have
risen
around
the
little
knoll
as
it
did
the
ginnel
thought
he
had
fixed
us
so
nice
and
he
had
miss
libbie
for
it
was
the
knoll
that
saved
us
the
day
the
regiment
left
for
fort
mcpherson
the
ginnel
staid
behind
till
dark
everythin
in
order
to
make
you
comfortable
and
he
left
at
at
night
with
his
escort
to
join
the
troops
he
rather
ride
ride
all
night
than
miss
that
much
of
his
visit
with
you
before
he
went
he
came
to
my
tent
to
say
i
stuck
my
hand
out
and
said
i
do
like
to
see
you
goin
off
in
this
wild
country
at
this
hour
of
the
night
have
to
go
he
says
i
called
take
care
of
libbie
eliza
and
puttin
spurs
to
his
horse
off
he
rode
then
i
thought
they
certainly
get
him
ridin
right
into
the
mouth
of
you
know
how
plain
the
sound
comes
over
the
prairie
with
nothin
no
trees
or
anythin
to
interfere
well
in
the
night
i
was
sounds
some
might
have
said
they
was
buffalo
but
on
thy
went
lumpety
lump
lumpety
lump
and
they
was
indians
miss
libbie
sure
as
you
born
they
was
indians
gettin
out
of
the
way
and
oh
i
was
so
scart
for
the
ginnel
chapter
xviii
ordered
back
to
fort
harker
after
the
experience
our
things
were
scarcely
dry
before
i
found
for
the
second
time
what
it
was
to
be
under
the
complete
subjection
of
military
rule
the
fiat
was
issued
that
we
women
must
depart
from
camp
and
return
to
garrison
as
it
was
considered
unsafe
for
us
to
remain
it
was
an
intense
disappointment
for
though
fort
hays
and
our
camp
were
more
than
dreary
after
the
ravages
of
the
storm
to
leave
there
meant
cutting
myself
off
from
any
other
chance
that
might
come
in
my
way
of
joining
my
husband
or
of
seeing
him
at
our
camp
two
of
the
officers
and
an
escort
of
ten
mounted
men
going
to
fort
harker
on
duty
accompanied
our
little
cortege
of
departing
women
at
the
first
the
soldiers
all
dismounted
as
we
halted
and
managed
by
some
pretext
to
get
into
the
and
buy
whiskey
not
long
after
we
were
again
i
saw
one
of
the
men
reel
on
his
saddle
and
he
was
lifted
into
the
wagon
that
carried
forage
for
the
mules
and
horses
one
by
one
all
were
finally
dumped
into
the
wagons
by
the
teamsters
who
fortunately
were
sober
and
the
troopers
horses
were
tied
behind
the
vehicles
and
we
found
ourselves
without
an
escort
plains
whiskey
is
usually
very
rapid
in
its
effect
but
the
liquor
was
concocted
from
drugs
that
had
power
to
lay
out
even
a
old
cavalryman
like
a
dead
person
in
what
seemed
no
time
at
all
eliza
said
they
only
needed
to
smell
it
was
so
deadly
poison
a
barrel
of
tolerably
good
whiskey
sent
from
the
states
was
by
the
addition
of
drugs
made
into
several
barrels
after
it
reached
the
plains
the
hours
of
that
march
seemed
endless
we
were
helpless
and
knew
that
we
were
going
over
ground
that
was
hotly
contested
by
the
red
man
we
rose
gradually
to
the
summit
of
each
divide
and
looked
with
anxious
eyes
into
every
depression
but
we
were
no
sooner
relieved
to
find
it
safe
than
my
terrors
began
as
to
what
the
next
might
reveal
when
we
came
upon
an
occasional
ravine
it
represented
to
my
frightened
soul
any
number
of
indians
in
ambush
in
that
country
the
air
is
so
clear
that
every
object
on
the
brow
of
a
small
ascent
of
ground
is
silhouetted
against
the
deep
blue
of
the
sky
the
indians
place
little
heaps
of
stones
on
these
slight
eminences
and
lurk
behind
them
to
watch
the
approach
of
troops
every
little
pile
of
rocks
seemed
to
my
strained
eyes
to
hide
the
head
of
a
savage
they
even
appeared
to
move
and
this
effect
was
heightened
by
the
waves
of
heat
that
hover
over
the
surface
of
the
earth
under
that
blazing
sun
i
was
thoroughly
frightened
doubtless
made
much
more
so
because
i
had
nothing
else
to
think
of
as
the
end
of
the
journey
would
not
mean
for
me
what
the
termination
of
ever
so
dangerous
a
march
would
have
been
in
the
other
direction
had
i
been
going
over
such
country
to
join
my
husband
the
prospect
would
have
put
temporary
courage
into
every
nerve
during
the
hours
of
daylight
the
vigilance
of
the
officers
was
unceasing
they
knew
that
one
of
the
most
hazardous
days
of
their
lives
was
upon
them
they
felt
intensely
the
responsibility
of
the
care
of
us
and
i
do
not
doubt
gallant
as
they
were
that
they
mentally
pronounced
anathemas
upon
officers
who
had
wanted
to
see
their
wives
so
badly
that
they
had
let
them
come
into
such
a
country
when
we
had
first
gone
over
the
route
however
its
danger
was
not
a
circumstance
to
this
time
our
eyes
rarely
left
the
horizon
they
were
strained
to
discern
signs
that
had
come
to
be
familiar
even
by
our
hearing
them
discussed
so
constantly
and
we
still
novices
in
the
experience
of
that
strange
country
had
seen
for
ourselves
enough
to
prove
that
no
vigilance
was
too
great
if
on
the
monotonous
landscape
a
whirl
of
dust
arose
instantly
it
was
a
matter
of
doubt
whether
it
meant
our
foe
or
one
of
the
strange
eccentricities
of
that
part
of
the
world
the
most
peculiar
communions
are
those
that
the
clouds
seem
to
have
with
the
earth
which
result
in
a
cone
of
dust
whirlpooling
itself
straight
in
the
air
while
the
rest
of
the
earth
is
apparently
without
commotion
bearing
no
relation
to
the
funnel
that
seems
to
struggle
upward
and
be
dissolved
into
the
passing
wind
with
what
intense
concentration
we
watched
to
see
it
so
disappear
if
the
puff
of
dust
continued
to
spread
the
light
touching
it
into
a
deeper
yellow
and
finally
revealing
some
darker
shades
and
at
last
shaping
itself
into
dusky
forms
we
were
in
agony
of
suspense
until
the
proved
that
it
was
a
herd
of
antelopes
fleeing
from
our
approach
there
literally
seemed
to
be
not
one
inch
of
the
way
that
the
watchful
eyes
of
the
officers
the
drivers
or
we
women
were
not
strained
to
discover
every
object
that
specked
the
horizon
or
rose
on
the
trail
in
front
of
us
with
all
the
terror
and
suspense
of
those
dragging
miles
i
could
not
be
insensible
to
the
superb
and
riotous
colors
of
the
wild
flowers
that
carpeted
our
way
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
ever
been
where
the
men
could
not
be
asked
and
were
not
willing
to
halt
or
let
me
stop
and
gather
one
of
every
kind
the
gorgeousness
of
the
reds
and
orange
of
those
prairie
blossoms
was
a
surprise
to
me
i
had
not
dreamed
that
the
earth
could
so
glow
with
rich
tints
the
spring
rains
had
soaked
the
ground
long
enough
to
start
into
life
the
wonderful
dyes
that
for
a
brief
time
emblazon
the
barren
wilderness
the
royal
livery
floats
but
a
short
period
over
their
temporary
domain
for
the
entire
cessation
of
even
the
night
dews
and
the
intensity
of
the
scorching
sun
shrivels
the
vivid
flaunting
feathery
petals
and
burns
the
venturesome
roots
down
into
the
earth
what
presuming
things
to
toss
their
pennants
over
so
inhospitable
a
land
but
what
a
boon
to
travelers
like
ourselves
to
see
for
even
the
brief
season
some
tint
besides
the
burnt
umber
and
yellow
ochre
of
those
plains
all
the
short
existence
of
these
flowers
is
condensed
into
the
color
tropical
in
richness
not
one
faint
waft
of
perfume
floated
on
the
air
about
us
but
it
was
all
we
ought
to
have
asked
that
their
brilliant
heads
appear
out
of
such
soil
this
has
served
to
make
me
very
appreciative
of
the
rich
exhalation
of
the
eastern
gardens
i
do
not
dare
say
what
the
first
perfume
of
the
honeysuckle
is
to
me
each
year
now
nor
would
i
infringe
upon
the
few
adjectives
vouchsafed
the
use
of
a
conventional
eastern
woman
when
as
it
happened
this
year
the
orange
blossoms
white
jessamine
and
woodbine
wafted
their
sweet
breaths
in
my
face
as
a
welcome
from
one
garden
to
which
good
fortune
led
me
i
remember
the
starvation
days
of
that
odorless
life
when
seeing
rare
colors
we
instantly
expected
rich
odors
but
found
them
not
and
i
try
to
adapt
myself
to
the
customs
of
the
country
and
not
rave
but
like
the
children
keep
up
a
mighty
thinking
buffalo
antelope
blacktail
deer
coyote
scurried
out
of
our
way
on
that
march
and
we
could
not
stop
to
follow
i
was
looking
always
for
some
new
sight
and
after
the
relief
that
i
felt
when
each
object
as
we
neared
it
turned
out
to
be
harmless
was
anxious
to
see
a
drove
of
wild
horses
there
were
still
herds
to
be
found
between
the
cimmaron
and
the
arkansas
rivers
the
general
told
me
of
seeing
one
of
the
herds
on
a
march
spoke
with
great
admiration
and
enthusiasm
of
the
leader
and
described
him
as
splendid
in
carriage
and
bearing
his
head
in
the
proudest
loftiest
manner
as
he
led
his
followers
they
were
not
large
they
must
have
been
the
spanish
pony
of
cortez
time
as
we
know
that
the
horse
is
not
indigenous
to
america
the
flowing
mane
and
tail
the
splendid
arch
of
the
neck
and
the
proud
head
carried
so
loftily
give
the
wild
horses
a
larger
taller
appearance
than
is
in
reality
theirs
few
ever
saw
the
droves
of
wild
horses
more
than
momentarily
they
run
like
the
wind
illustration
a
buffalo
at
bay
from
a
photograph
taken
on
the
spot
after
the
introduction
of
the
dromedary
into
texas
many
years
since
for
transportation
of
supplies
over
that
vast
territory
one
was
brought
up
to
colorado
because
of
the
immense
runs
it
could
make
without
water
it
was
taken
into
the
region
frequented
by
the
wild
horses
and
when
they
were
sighted
the
dromedary
was
started
in
pursuit
two
were
run
down
and
found
to
be
nearly
dead
when
overtaken
but
the
poor
dromedary
suffered
so
from
the
filling
the
soft
ball
of
its
feet
that
no
farther
pursuit
could
ever
be
undertaken
i
had
to
be
content
with
the
general
description
for
no
wild
horses
came
in
our
way
but
there
was
enough
to
satisfy
any
one
in
the
way
of
game
the
railroad
had
not
then
driven
to
the
right
and
left
the
inhabitants
of
that
vast
prairie
our
country
will
never
again
see
the
plains
dotted
with
game
of
all
sorts
the
railroad
stretches
its
iron
bands
over
these
desert
wastes
and
scarcely
a
skulking
coyote
hugging
the
ground
and
stealing
into
gulches
can
be
discovered
during
a
whole
day
journey
as
the
long
afternoon
was
waning
we
were
allowed
to
get
out
and
rest
a
little
while
for
we
had
reached
what
was
called
the
home
station
so
called
because
at
this
place
there
was
a
woman
then
the
only
one
along
the
entire
route
i
looked
with
more
admiration
than
i
could
express
on
this
fearless
creature
long
past
the
venturesome
time
of
early
youth
when
some
dare
much
for
excitement
she
was
as
calm
and
collected
as
her
husband
whom
she
valued
enough
to
endure
with
him
this
terrible
existence
how
good
the
things
tasted
that
she
cooked
and
how
different
the
dooryard
looked
from
those
of
the
other
stations
then
she
had
a
baby
antelope
and
the
apertures
that
served
as
windows
had
bits
of
white
curtains
and
altogether
i
did
not
wonder
that
over
the
hundreds
of
miles
of
the
home
station
was
a
place
the
men
looked
forward
to
as
the
only
reminder
of
the
civilization
that
a
good
woman
establishes
about
her
there
was
an
awful
sight
though
that
riveted
my
eyes
as
we
prepared
to
go
on
our
journey
and
the
officers
could
not
by
any
subterfuge
save
us
from
seeing
it
it
was
a
disabled
literally
riddled
with
bullets
its
leather
hanging
in
shreds
and
the
woodwork
cut
into
splinters
when
there
was
no
further
use
of
trying
to
conceal
it
from
us
we
were
told
that
this
stage
had
come
into
the
station
in
that
condition
the
day
before
and
the
fight
that
the
driver
and
had
been
through
was
desperate
there
was
no
getting
the
sight
of
that
vehicle
out
of
my
mind
during
the
rest
of
the
journey
what
a
friend
the
darkness
seemed
as
it
wrapped
its
protecting
mantle
about
us
after
the
long
twilight
ended
yet
it
was
almost
impossible
to
sleep
though
we
knew
we
were
comparatively
safe
till
dawn
at
daybreak
the
officers
asked
us
to
get
out
while
the
mules
were
watered
and
fed
and
rest
ourselves
and
though
i
had
been
so
long
riding
in
a
cramped
position
i
would
gladly
have
declined
cleanliness
is
next
to
godliness
and
one
of
our
friends
said
with
a
woman
it
is
before
godliness
yet
that
was
an
occasion
when
i
would
infinitely
have
preferred
to
be
numbered
with
the
great
unwashed
however
a
place
in
the
little
stream
at
the
foot
of
the
gully
was
pointed
out
and
we
took
our
tin
basin
and
towel
and
freshened
ourselves
by
this
early
toilet
but
there
was
no
lingering
to
prink
even
on
the
part
of
the
pretty
diana
our
eyes
were
staring
on
all
sides
with
a
dread
impossible
to
quell
and
back
into
the
ambulance
we
climbed
not
breathing
a
long
free
breath
until
the
last
of
those
terrible
eighty
miles
were
passed
and
we
beheld
with
untold
gratitude
the
roofs
of
the
quarters
at
fort
harker
i
felt
that
we
had
trespassed
as
much
as
we
ought
upon
the
hospitality
of
the
commanding
officer
of
the
post
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
sleep
in
our
ambulance
while
we
remained
in
the
garrison
he
consented
under
protest
and
our
wagon
and
that
of
gibbs
were
placed
in
the
space
between
two
government
storehouses
and
a
tarpaulin
was
stretched
over
the
two
eliza
prepared
our
simple
food
over
a
little
while
the
weather
remained
good
this
was
a
very
comfortable
camp
for
us
but
when
in
kansas
do
the
elements
continue
quiet
for
hours
in
the
darkest
hour
of
the
blackest
kind
of
night
the
wind
rose
into
a
tempest
rushing
around
the
corners
of
the
buildings
hunting
out
with
pertinacity
from
front
and
rear
our
poor
little
temporary
home
the
tarpaulin
was
lifted
on
high
and
with
ropes
and
thrashing
on
the
canvas
it
finally
broke
its
last
moorings
and
soared
off
into
space
the
rain
beat
in
the
curtains
of
the
ambulance
and
soaked
our
blankets
still
we
crept
together
on
the
farther
side
of
our
narrow
bed
and
rolled
up
in
our
shawls
tried
to
hide
our
eyes
from
the
lightning
and
our
ears
from
the
roar
of
the
storm
as
it
swept
between
the
sheltering
buildings
and
made
us
feel
as
if
we
were
camping
in
a
tunnel
our
neighbor
dog
joined
his
voice
with
the
sobs
and
groans
of
the
wind
while
in
the
short
intervals
of
quiet
we
called
out
trying
to
get
momentary
courage
from
speech
with
each
other
the
curtain
at
the
end
of
the
ambulance
jerked
itself
free
and
in
came
a
deluge
of
rain
from
a
new
direction
pins
strings
and
four
weak
hands
holding
their
best
did
no
earthly
good
and
i
longed
to
break
all
military
rule
and
scream
to
the
sentinel
not
to
speak
to
a
guard
on
post
is
one
of
the
early
lessons
instilled
into
every
one
in
military
life
it
required
such
terror
of
the
storm
and
just
such
a
drenching
as
we
were
getting
even
to
harbor
a
thought
of
this
direct
disobedience
of
orders
clutching
the
and
watching
the
soldier
who
was
revealed
by
the
frequent
flashes
of
lightning
as
he
tramped
his
solitary
way
might
have
gone
on
for
some
time
without
the
necessary
courage
coming
to
call
him
but
a
new
departure
of
the
wind
suddenly
set
us
in
motion
and
i
found
that
we
were
spinning
down
the
little
declivity
back
of
us
with
no
knowledge
of
when
or
where
we
would
stop
then
i
did
scream
and
the
peculiar
shrillness
of
a
terrified
woman
voice
reached
the
sentinel
blessed
breaker
of
his
country
laws
he
answered
to
a
higher
one
which
forbids
him
to
neglect
a
woman
in
danger
and
left
his
beat
to
run
to
our
succor
our
wagon
was
dragged
back
by
some
of
the
soldiers
on
night
duty
at
the
and
was
newly
pinioned
to
the
earth
with
stronger
and
ropes
but
sleep
was
murdered
for
that
night
of
course
the
guard
reported
to
the
commanding
officer
as
is
their
rule
and
soon
a
lantern
or
two
came
zigzagging
over
the
in
our
direction
and
the
officers
called
to
know
if
they
could
speak
with
us
there
was
no
use
in
arguing
gibbs
and
her
boys
diana
drenched
and
limp
as
to
clothes
and
i
decidedly
moist
were
fished
out
of
our
watery
and
with
our
arms
full
of
apparel
and
satchels
we
followed
the
officers
in
the
dark
to
the
dry
quarters
that
we
had
tried
our
best
to
decline
rather
than
make
trouble
it
was
decided
that
we
must
proceed
to
fort
riley
as
there
were
no
quarters
to
offer
us
and
as
i
have
tried
to
describe
it
had
its
drawbacks
in
the
rainy
season
had
it
not
meant
for
me
ninety
miles
farther
separation
from
my
husband
seemingly
cut
off
from
all
chance
of
joining
him
again
i
would
have
welcomed
the
plan
of
going
back
as
fort
harker
was
at
this
time
the
most
absolutely
dismal
and
melancholy
spot
i
remember
ever
to
have
seen
a
terrible
and
unprecedented
calamity
had
fallen
upon
the
usually
healthful
place
for
cholera
had
broken
out
and
the
soldiers
were
dying
by
platoons
i
had
been
accustomed
to
think
in
all
the
vicissitudes
that
had
crowded
themselves
into
these
few
months
whatever
else
we
were
deprived
of
we
at
least
had
a
climate
unsurpassed
for
salubrity
and
i
still
think
so
for
some
strange
reason
right
out
in
the
midst
of
that
wide
open
plain
with
no
stagnant
water
no
imperfect
drainage
no
earthly
reason
it
seemed
to
us
this
epidemic
had
suddenly
appeared
and
in
a
form
so
violent
that
a
few
hours
of
suffering
ended
fatally
nobody
took
dying
into
consideration
out
there
in
those
days
all
were
well
and
and
almost
everyone
was
young
who
ventured
into
that
new
country
so
no
lumber
had
been
provided
to
make
coffins
for
a
time
the
rudest
receptacles
were
hammered
together
made
out
of
the
hardtack
boxes
almost
immediate
burial
took
place
as
there
was
no
ice
nor
even
a
safe
place
to
keep
the
bodies
of
the
unfortunate
victims
it
was
absolutely
necessary
but
an
awful
thought
nevertheless
this
scurrying
under
the
ground
of
the
lately
dead
perhaps
only
wrapped
in
a
coarse
gray
army
blanket
and
with
the
burial
service
hurriedly
read
for
all
were
needed
as
nurses
and
time
was
too
precious
to
say
even
the
last
words
except
in
haste
the
officers
and
their
families
did
not
escape
and
sorrow
fell
upon
every
one
when
an
attractive
young
woman
who
had
dared
everything
in
the
way
of
hardships
to
follow
her
husband
was
marked
by
that
terrible
finger
which
bade
her
go
alone
into
the
valley
of
death
in
the
midst
of
this
scourge
the
sisters
of
charity
came
two
of
them
died
and
afterward
a
priest
but
they
were
replaced
by
others
who
remained
until
the
pestilence
had
wrought
its
worst
then
they
gathered
the
orphaned
children
of
the
soldiers
together
and
returned
with
them
to
the
parent
house
of
their
order
in
leavenworth
i
would
gladly
have
these
memories
fade
out
of
my
life
for
the
scenes
at
that
post
have
no
ray
of
light
except
the
heroic
conduct
of
the
men
and
women
who
stood
their
ground
through
the
danger
i
can
not
pass
by
those
memorable
days
in
the
early
history
of
kansas
without
my
tribute
to
the
brave
officers
and
men
who
went
through
so
much
to
open
the
way
for
settlers
i
lately
rode
through
the
state
which
seemed
when
i
first
saw
it
a
hopeless
barren
waste
and
found
the
land
under
fine
cultivation
the
houses
barns
and
fences
excellently
built
cattle
in
the
meadows
and
sometimes
several
teams
ploughing
in
one
field
i
could
not
help
wondering
what
the
rich
owners
of
these
estates
would
say
if
i
should
step
down
from
the
car
and
give
them
a
little
picture
of
kansas
with
the
hot
blistered
earth
dry
beds
of
streams
and
soil
apparently
so
barren
that
not
even
the
would
bloom
save
for
a
brief
period
after
the
spring
rains
then
add
pestilence
indians
and
an
undisciplined
mutinous
soldiery
who
composed
our
first
recruits
and
it
seems
strange
that
our
officers
persevered
at
all
i
hope
the
prosperous
ranchman
will
give
them
one
word
of
thanks
as
he
advances
to
greater
wealth
since
but
for
our
brave
fellows
the
kansas
pacific
railroad
could
not
have
been
built
nor
could
the
early
settlers
daring
as
they
were
have
sowed
the
seed
that
now
yields
them
such
rich
harvests
we
had
no
choice
about
leaving
fort
harker
there
was
no
accommodation
for
us
indeed
we
would
have
hampered
the
already
overworked
officers
and
men
so
we
took
our
departure
for
fort
riley
there
we
found
perfect
quiet
the
negro
troops
were
reduced
to
discipline
and
everything
went
on
as
if
there
were
no
such
thing
as
the
dead
and
the
dying
that
we
had
left
a
few
hours
before
there
was
but
a
small
garrison
and
we
easily
found
empty
quarters
that
were
lent
to
us
by
the
commanding
officer
then
the
life
of
watching
and
waiting
and
trying
to
possess
my
soul
in
patience
began
again
and
my
whole
day
resolved
itself
into
a
mental
protest
against
the
slowness
of
the
hours
before
the
morning
mail
could
be
received
it
was
a
doleful
time
for
us
but
i
remember
no
uttered
complaints
as
such
for
we
silently
agreed
they
would
weaken
our
courage
if
tears
were
shed
they
fell
on
the
pillow
where
the
blessed
darkness
came
to
absolve
us
from
the
rigid
watchfulness
that
we
tried
to
keep
over
our
feelings
my
husband
gladdened
many
a
dark
day
by
the
cheeriest
letters
how
he
ever
managed
to
write
so
buoyantly
was
a
mystery
when
i
found
afterward
what
he
was
enduring
i
rarely
had
a
letter
with
even
so
much
as
a
vein
of
discontent
during
all
our
separations
at
that
time
came
two
that
were
strangely
in
contrast
to
all
the
brave
encouraging
missives
that
had
cheered
my
day
the
accounts
of
cholera
met
our
regiment
on
their
march
into
the
department
of
the
platte
and
the
general
in
the
midst
of
intense
anxiety
with
no
prospect
of
direct
communication
assailed
by
false
reports
of
my
illness
at
last
showed
a
side
of
his
character
that
was
seldom
visible
his
suspense
regarding
my
exposure
to
pestilence
and
his
distress
over
the
fright
and
danger
i
had
endured
at
the
time
of
the
flood
at
fort
hays
made
his
brave
spirit
quail
and
there
were
desperate
words
written
which
had
he
not
been
relieved
by
news
of
my
safety
would
have
ended
in
his
taking
steps
to
resign
even
he
whom
i
scarcely
ever
knew
to
yield
to
discouraging
circumstances
wrote
that
he
could
not
and
would
not
endure
such
a
life
our
days
at
fort
riley
had
absolutely
nothing
to
vary
them
after
mail
time
i
sat
on
the

of
distribution
pretending
to
sew
or
read
but
watching
constantly
for
the
door
of
the
office
to
yield
up
next
to
the
most
important
man
in
the
wide
world
to
me
the
soldier
whose
duty
it
was
to
bring
the
mail
became
so
inflated
by
the
eagerness
with
which
his
steps
were
watched
that
it
came
near
being
the
death
of
him
when
he
joined
his
company
in
the
autumn
and
was
lost
in
its
monotonous
ranks
he
was
a
ponderous
lumbering
fellow
in
body
and
mind
who
had
been
left
behind
by
his
captain
ostensibly
to
take
care
of
the
company
property
but
i
soon
found
there
was
another
reason
as
his
wits
had
for
some
time
been
unsettled
that
is
giving
him
the
benefit
of
a
doubt
if
he
ever
had
any
addled
as
his
brain
might
be
the
remnant
of
intelligence
was
ample
in
my
eyes
if
it
enabled
him
to
make
his
way
to
our
door
as
he
belonged
to
the
seventh
cavalry
he
considered
that
everything
at
the
post
must
be
subservient
to
my
wish
when
in
reality
i
was
dependent
for
a
temporary
roof
on
the
courtesy
of
the
infantry
officer
in
command
if
i
even
met
him
in
our
walks
he
seemed
to
swell
to
twice
his
size
and
to
feel
that
some
of
the
odor
of
sanctity
hung
around
him
whether
he
bore
messages
from
the
absent
or
not
illustration
the
addled
the
contents
of
the
being
divided
over
six
feet
of
anatomical
and
military
perfection
came
stalking
through
the
he
would
not
demean
himself
to
hasten
and
his
measured
steps
were
in
accordance
with
the
gait
prescribed
in
the
past
by
his
sergeant
on
drill
he
appeared
to
throw
his
head
back
more
loftily
as
he
perceived
that
my
eyes
followed
his
creeping
steps
he
seemed
to
be
reasoning
did
napoleon
ever
run
the
duke
of
wellington
ever
hasten
or
general
scott
quicken
his
gait
or
impair
his
breathing
by
undue
activity
simply
because
an
unreasoning
impatient
woman
was
waiting
somewhere
for
them
to
appear
it
was
not
at
all
in
accordance
with
his
ideas
of
martial
character
to
exhibit
indecorous
speed
the
great
and
responsible
office
of
conveying
the
letters
from
the
officer
to
the
quarters
had
been
assigned
to
him
and
nothing
he
determined
should
interfere
with
its
being
filled
with
dignity
his
country
looked
to
him
as
its
savior
only
a
casual
and
condescending
thought
was
given
to
his
comrades
who
perhaps
at
that
time
were
receiving
in
their
bodies
the
arrows
of
indian
warriors
no
matter
how
eagerly
i
eyed
the
great
official
envelope
in
his
hand
which
i
knew
well
was
mine
he
persisted
in
observing
all
the
form
and
ceremony
that
he
had
decided
was
suitable
for
its
presentation
he
was
especially
particular
to
assume
the
first
position
of
a
soldier
as
he
drew
up
in
front
of
me
the
tone
with
which
he
addressed
me
was
deliberate
and
grandiloquent
the
only
variation
in
his
regulation
manners
was
that
he
allowed
himself
to
speak
before
he
was
spoken
to
with
the
flourish
of
his
colossal
arm
in
a
salute
that
took
in
a
wide
semicircle
of
kansas
air
he
said
good
morning
george
armstrong
custer
he
was
the
only
gleam
of
fun
we
had
in
those
dismal
days
he
was
a
marked
contrast
to
the
disciplined
enlisted
man
who
never
speaks
unless
first
addressed
by
his
superiors
and
who
is
modesty
itself
in
demeanor
and
language
in
the
presence
of
the
officers
wives
the
farewell
salute
of
our
was
funnier
than
his
approach
he
wheeled
on
his
military
heel
and
swung
wide
his
flourishing
arm
but
the
right
about
face
i
generally
lost
for
after
snatching
my
envelope
from
him
unawed
by
his
formality
i
fled
into
the
house
to
hide
while
i
laughed
and
cried

chapter
xix
the
first
fight
of
the
seventh
cavalry
the
first
fight
of
the
seventh
cavalry
was
at
fort
wallace
in
june
a
band
of
three
hundred
cheyennes
under
roman
nose
attacked
the
near
that
fort
and
ran
off
the
stock
elated
with
this
success
they
proceeded
to
fort
wallace
that
poor
little
group
of
log
huts
and
mud
cabins
having
apparently
no
power
of
resistance
only
the
simplest
devices
could
be
resorted
to
for
defense
the
commissary
stores
and
ammunition
were
partly
protected
by
a
low
wall
of
filled
with
sand
there
were
no
logs
near
enough
and
no
time
if
there
had
been
to
build
a
stockade
but
our
splendid
cavalry
charged
out
as
boldly
as
if
they
were
leaving
behind
them
reserve
troops
and
a
battery
of
artillery
they
were
met
by
a
the
indians
with
lances
poised
and
arrows
on
the
string
coming
on
swiftly
in
overwhelming
numbers
it
was
a
fight
roman
nose
was
about
to
throw
his
javelin
at
one
of
our
men
when
the
cavalryman
with
his
left
hand
gave
a
equal
to
the
best
that
many
good
fencers
can
execute
with
their
with
his
spencer
rifle
he
wounded
the
chief
and
saw
him
fall
forward
on
his
horse
the
post
had
been
so
short
of
men
that
a
dozen
negro
soldiers
who
had
come
with
their
wagon
from
an
outpost
for
supplies
were
placed
near
the
garrison
on
picket
duty
while
the
fight
was
going
on
the
two
officers
in
command
found
themselves
near
each
other
on
the
and
observed
a
wagon
with
four
mules
tearing
out
to
the
line
of
battle
it
was
filled
with
negroes
standing
up
all
firing
in
the
direction
of
the
indians
the
driver
lashed
the
mules
with
his
and
roared
at
them
as
they
ran
when
the
was
reached
the
colored
men
leaped
out
and
began
firing
again
no
one
had
ordered
them
to
leave
their
but
they
were
determined
that
no
soldiering
should
be
carried
on
in
which
their
valor
was
not
proved
the
officers
saw
with
surprise
that
one
of
the
number
ran
off
by
himself
into
the
most
dangerous
place
and
one
of
them
remarked
there
a
gone
nigger
for
a
certainty
they
saw
him
fall
throw
up
his
hands
kick
his
feet
in
the
air
and
then
collapse
dead
to
all
appearances
after
the
fight
was
over
and
the
indians
had
withdrawn
to
the
bluffs
the
soldiers
were
called
together
and
ordered
back
to
the
post
at
that
moment
a
negro
gun
in
hand
walked
up
from
where
the
one
supposed
to
be
slain
had
last
been
seen
it
was
the
dead
restored
to
life
when
asked
by
the
officer
what
in
thunder
do
you
mean
running
off
at
such
a
distance
into
the
face
of
danger
and
throwing
up
your
feet
and
hands
as
if
shot
he
replied
oh
lord
massa
i
just
did
dat
to
fool
i
fot
deyed
try
to
get
my
scalp
thinkin
i
war
dead
and
den
i
jest
get
one
of
the
following
official
report
sent
in
from
some
colored
men
stationed
at
wilson
creek
who
were
attacked
and
successfully
drove
off
the
indians
will
give
further
proof
of
their
good
service
while
at
the
same
time
it
reveals
a
little
of
other
sides
of
the
negro
when
he
first
began
to
serve
uncle
sam
all
the
boys
done
bully
but
corporal
johnson
he
flinked
the
way
he
flinked
was
to
wait
till
the
boys
had
drove
the
injuns
two
miles
and
then
he
hollered
it
to
and
the
boys
do
think
that
a
man
that
would
flink
that
way
ought
to
have
corporal
straps
in
order
to
give
this
effort
at
military
composition
its
full
effect
it
would
be
necessary
to
add
the
official
report
of
a
soldier
no
matter
how
trifling
the
duty
the
stilted
language
bristling
with
technical
pomposity
in
which
every
military
move
is
reported
makes
me
a
question
if
the
white
man
is
not
about
as
absurd
in
his
way
as
the
darkey
was
in
his
illustration
negroes
form
their
own
poor
fort
wallace
in
another
attack
on
the
post
where
several
of
our
men
were
killed
there
chanced
to
be
some
engineers
stopping
at
the
garrison
to
new
mexico
where
a
government
survey
was
to
be
undertaken
one
of
them
carrying
a
small
camera
photographed
a
sergeant
lying
on
the
after
the
enemy
had
retreated
the
body
was
gashed
and
pierced
by
arrows
everything
combined
to
keep
that
little
garrison
in
a
state
of
siege
and
a
gloomy
pall
hung
over
the
beleaguered
spot
as
the
were
one
after
another
attacked
burned
the
men
murdered
and
the
stock
driven
off
for
a
distance
of
three
hundred
miles
the
difficulty
of
sending
mail
became
almost
insurmountable
denver
lay
out
there
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
as
isolated
as
if
it
had
been
a
lone
island
in
the
pacific
ocean
whenever
a
coach
went
out
with
the
mail
a
second
one
was
filled
with
soldiers
and
led
the
advance
the
seventh
cavalry
endeavored
to
fortify
some
of
the
deserted
but
the
only
means
of
defense
consisted
in
burrowing
underground
after
the
holes
were
dug
barely
large
enough
for
four
men
standing
and
a
barrel
of
water
and
a
week
provision
it
was
covered
over
with
logs
and
turf
leaving
an
aperture
for
firing
where
the
men
had
warning
they
could
stand
off
many
indians
and
save
the
horses
in
another
adjacent
after
a
journey
along
the
infested
route
where
one
of
our
officers
was
detailed
to
post
a
corporal
and
four
men
at
the
stations
when
the
stage
company
endeavored
to
reinstate
themselves
he
decided
to
go
on
into
denver
for
a
few
days
the
detention
then
was
threatening
to
be
prolonged
and
at
the
stage
company
headquarters
the
greatest
opposition
was
encountered
before
our
officer
could
induce
them
to
send
out
a
coach
fortunately
as
it
afterward
proved
three
soldiers
who
had
orders
to
return
to
their
troop
accompanied
him
the
stage
company
opposed
every
move
and
warned
him
that
he
left
at
his
own
risk
but
there
was
no
other
alternative
as
he
was
due
and
needed
at
fort
wallace
at
one
of
the
nearest
denver
a
woman
still
endeavored
to
brave
it
out
but
her
nerve
deserted
her
at
last
and
she
implored
our
officer
to
take
her
as
far
as
he
went
on
her
way
into
the
states
her
husband
trying
to
protect
the
company
interests
elected
to
remain
but
begged
that
his
wife
might
be
taken
away
from
the
deadly
peril
of
their
surroundings
our
officer
frankly
said
there
was
very
little
chance
that
the
stage
would
ever
reach
fort
wallace
she
replied
that
she
had
been
frightened
half
to
death
all
summer
and
was
sure
to
be
murdered
if
she
remained
and
might
as
well
die
in
the
stage
as
there
was
no
chance
for
her
at
the
station
every
revolution
of
the
wheels
brought
them
into
greater
danger
the
three
soldiers
on
the
top
of
the
stage
kept
a
lookout
on
every
side
while
the
officer
inside
sat
with
rifle
in
hand
looking
from
the
door
on
either
side
the
trail
even
with
all
this
vigilance
the
attack
when
it
came
was
a
surprise
the
indians
had
hidden
in
a
near
the
road
their
first
shot
fatally
wounded
one
of
the
soldiers
who
dropping
his
gun
fell
over
the
coach
railing
and
with
dying
energy
half
swung
himself
into
the
door
of
the
stage
gasping
out
a
message
to
his
mother
our
officer
replied
that
he
would
listen
to
the
parting
words
later
helped
the
man
to
get
upon
the
seat
and
without
a
preliminary
pushed
the
woman
down
into
the
deep
body
of
the
coach
bidding
her
as
she
valued
the
small
hope
of
life
not
to
let
herself
be
seen
as
has
been
said
before
those
familiar
with
indian
warfare
know
well
with
what
redoubled
ferocity
the
savage
fights
if
he
finds
that
a
white
woman
is
likely
to
fall
into
his
hands
it
is
well
known
also
that
the
squaws
are
ignored
if
the
chiefs
have
a
white
woman
in
their
power
and
it
brings
a
more
fearful
agony
to
her
lot
for
when
the
warriors
are
absent
from
the
village
the
squaws
wild
with
jealousy
heap
cruelty
and
exhausting
labor
upon
the
helpless
victim
all
this
the
frontier
woman
knew
as
we
all
did
and
it
needed
no
second
command
to
keep
her
imperiled
head
on
the
floor
of
the
coach
the
instant
the
dying
soldier
had
dropped
his
gun
the
driver
ah
what
cool
heads
those
had
seized
the
weapon
thrusting
his
lines
between
his
agile
and
muscular
knees
inciting
his
mules
and
every
shot
had
a
deadly
aim
the
soldiers
fired
one
volley
and
then
leaped
to
the
ground
as
the
officer
sprang
from
the
stage
door
and
following
beside
the
vehicle
continued
to
fire
as
they
walked
the
first
two
shots
from
the
roof
of
the
coach
had
killed
two
indians
hidden
in
the
hole
made
by
the
by
that
means
our
men
got
what
they
term
the
morale
on
them
and
though
they
pursued
it
was
at
a
greater
distance
than
it
would
have
been
had
not
two
of
their
number
fallen
at
the
beginning
of
the
attack
illustration
an
attack
on
a
this
running
fire
continued
for
five
miles
when
fortunately
for
the
little
band
one
of
the
stage
stations
where
a
few
men
had
been
posted
on
our
officer
trip
out
was
reached
at
last
here
a
halt
was
made
as
the
indians
congregated
on
a
bluff
where
they
could
watch
safely
the
coach
was
a
wreck
the
large
lamps
on
either
side
of
the
driver
seat
were
shattered
completely
and
there
were
six
between
the
roof
and
the
wooden
body
of
the
coach
when
the
door
of
the
stage
was
opened
and
the
crouching
woman
lifted
her
face
from
the
floor
and
was
helped
out
she
was
so
unmoved
so
calm
the
officer
and
soldiers
were
astonished
at
her
nerve
she
looked
about
and
said
but
i
do
see
any
indians
yet
the
officer
told
her
that
if
she
would
take
the
trouble
to
look
over
on
the
bluff
she
would
find
them
on
dress
parade
then
she
told
him
about
her
experience
in
the
stage
the
dying
soldier
had
breathed
his
last
soon
after
he
fell
into
the
coach
and
all
the
five
miles
his
dead
body
kept
slipping
from
the
seat
on
to
the
prostrate
woman
in
vain
she
pushed
it
one
side
the
violence
with
which
the
vehicle
rocked
from
side
to
side
as
the
driver
urged
his
animals
to
their
utmost
speed
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
protect
herself
from
contact
with
the
heavy
corpse
that
rolled
about
with
the
plunging
of
the
coach
all
this
repeated
without
agitation
with
no
word
of
fear
for
the
remaining
portion
of
the
journey
which
happily
was
safely
finished
drew
from
our
officer
almost
dumb
with
amazement
at
the
fortitude
displayed
a
speech
that
would
rarely
be
set
down
by
the
novelist
who
imagines
conversations
but
which
is
just
what
is
likely
to
be
said
in
real
life
by
jove
you
deserve
a
chromo
one
troop
of
the
seventh
cavalry
was
left
to
garrison
fort
wallace
while
the
remainder
of
the
regiment
was
scouting
the
post
was
then
about
as
dreary
as
any
spot
on
earth
there
were
no
trees
only
the
arid
plain
surrounded
it
and
the
sirocco
winds
drove
the
sands
of
that
desolate
desert
into
the
that
served
for
the
habitation
of
officers
and
men
the
supplies
were
of
the
worst
description
it
was
impossible
to
get
vegetables
of
any
kind
and
there
was
therefore
no
preventing
the
soldier
scourge
scurvy
which
the
heat
aggravated
inflaming
the
already
burning
flesh
even
the
medical
supplies
were
limited
none
of
the
posts
at
that
time
were
provided
with
decent
food
that
is
none
beyond
the
railroad
i
remember
how
much
troubled
my
husband
was
over
this
subject
when
i
joined
him
at
fort
hays
the
bacon
issued
to
the
soldiers
was
not
only
rancid
but
was
supplied
by
dishonest
contractors
who
slipped
in
any
foreign
substance
they
could
to
make
the
weight
come
up
to
the
required
amount
and
thus
the
soldiers
were
cheated
out
of
the
quantity
due
them
as
well
as
imposed
upon
in
the
quality
of
their
rations
it
was
the
privilege
of
the
enlisted
men
to
make
their
complaints
to
the
commanding
officer
and
some
of
them
sent
to
ask
the
general
to
come
to
the
company
street
and
allow
them
to
prove
to
him
what
frauds
were
being
practiced
i
went
with
him
and
saw
a
flat
stone
the
size
of
the
slices
of
bacon
as
they
were
packed
together
sandwiched
between
the
layers
my
husband
was
justly
incensed
but
could
promise
no
immediate
redress
the
route
of
travel
was
so
dangerous
that
it
was
necessary
to
detail
a
larger
number
of
men
to
guard
any
train
of
supplies
that
attempted
to
reach
those
distant
posts
the
soldiers
felt
and
justly
too
that
it
was
an
outrage
that
preparations
for
the
arrival
of
so
large
a
number
of
troops
had
not
been
perfected
in
the
spring
before
the
whole
country
was
in
a
state
of
siege
the
supplies
provided
for
the
consumption
of
those
troops
operating
in
the
field
or
stationed
at
the
posts
had
been
sent
out
during
the
war
it
was
then
and
they
had
lain
in
the
poor
adobe
or
storehouse
all
the
intervening
time
more
than
two
years
at
forts
wallace
and
hays
there
were
no
storehouses
and
the
flour
and
bacon
were
only
protected
by
tarpaulins
both
became
rancid
and
moldy
and
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
rats
and
mice
a
larger
quantity
of
supplies
was
forwarded
to
that
portion
of
the
country
the
last
year
of
the
war
than
was
needed
for
the
volunteer
troops
sent
out
there
and
consequently
our
seventh
cavalry
scouting
day
and
night
all
through
that
eventful
summer
were
compelled
to
subsist
on
the
food
already
on
hand
it
was
the
most
mistaken
economy
to
persist
in
issuing
such
rations
when
it
is
so
well
known
that
a
stomach
is
a
strong
background
for
a
courageous
heart
the
desertions
were
unceasing
the
nearer
the
troops
approached
the
mountains
the
more
the
men
took
themselves
off
to
the
mines
in
april
of
that
year
no
deaths
had
occurred
at
fort
wallace
but
by
november
there
were
sixty
mounds
outside
the
garrison
covering
the
brave
hearts
of
soldiers
who
had
either
succumbed
to
illness
or
been
shot
by
indians
it
was
a
fearful
mortality
for
a
garrison
of
fewer
than
two
hundred
souls
if
the
soldiers
hungry
for
fresh
meat
went
out
to
shoot
buffalo
the
half
of
them
mounted
guard
to
protect
those
who
literally
took
their
lives
in
their
hands
to
provide
a
few
meals
of
wholesome
food
for
themselves
and
their
comrades
at
one
company
post
on
the
south
platte
a
troop
of
our
seventh
cavalry
was
stationed
in
the
mining
excitement
that
ran
so
high
in
and
the
captain
woke
one
morning
to
find
that
his
first
sergeant
and
forty
out
of
sixty
men
that
composed
the
garrison
had
decamped
with
horses
and
equipments
for
the
mines
this
left
the
handful
of
men
in
imminent
peril
from
indian
assaults
the
wily
foe
lies
hidden
for
days
outside
the
garrison
protected
by
a
heap
of
stones
or
a
and
informs
himself
as
no
other
spy
on
earth
ever
can
just
how
many
souls
the
little
group
of
tents
or
the
quarters
represent
in
this
dire
strait
a
dauntless
sergeant
andrews
offered
to
go
in
search
of
the
missing
men
he
had
established
his
reputation
as
a
marksman
in
the
regiment
and
soldiers
used
to
say
that
such
shooting
as
andrews
did
got
the
bulge
on
everybody
he
was
seemingly
fearless
the
captain
consented
to
his
departure
but
demurred
to
his
going
alone
the
sergeant
believed
he
could
only
succeed
if
he
went
into
the
unaccompanied
and
so
the
officer
permitted
him
to
go
he
arrested
and
brought
away
nine
traveling
two
hundred
miles
with
them
to
fort
wallace
there
was
no
at
the
post
and
the
commanding
officer
had
to
exercise
his
ingenuity
to
secure
these
deserters
a
large
hole
was
dug
in
the
middle
of
the
and
covered
with
logs
and
earth
leaving
a
square
aperture
in
the
centre
the
ladder
by
which
they
descended
was
removed
by
the
guard
when
all
were
in
and
the
bastile
could
hardly
be
more
secure
than
this
ingenious
prison
two
separate
attacks
were
made
by
three
hundred
cheyennes
to
capture
fort
wallace
that
summer
during
the
first
fight
the
prisoners
in
their
pit
heard
the
firing
and
knew
that
all
the
troops
were
outside
the
post
engaged
with
the
indians
knowing
their
helplessness
their
torture
of
mind
can
be
imagined
if
the
enemy
succeeded
in
entering
the
garrison
their
fate
was
sealed
the
attacks
were
so
sudden
that
there
was
no
opportunity
to
release
these
men
the
officers
knew
well
enough
that
facing
a
common
foe
they
might
count
on
unquestionable
unity
of
action
from
the
deserters
some
clemency
was
to
be
expected
from
a
military
court
that
would
eventually
try
them
but
all
the
world
knows
the
savage
cry
is
no
quarter
in
an
attack
on
a
post
there
is
only
a
wild
stampede
at
the
sound
of
the
general
from
the
trumpet
there
is
a
rush
for
weapons
and
every
one
dashes
outside
the
garrison
to
the
in
such
a
race
every
soldier
elects
to
be
his
own
captain
till
the
field
is
reached
i
have
seen
the
troops
pour
out
of
a
garrison
at
an
unexpected
attack
in
an
incredibly
short
time
no
one
stands
upon
the
order
of
his
going
or
cares
whose
gun
or
whose
horse
he
seizes
on
the
way
once
the
is
formed
the
soldierly
qualities
assert
themselves
and
complete
order
is
resumed
it
is
only
necessary
to
be
in
the
midst
of
such
excitement
to
realize
how
readily
prisoners
out
of
sight
would
be
forgotten
after
the
fight
was
over
and
the
indians
were
driven
off
the
poor
fellows
sent
to
ask
if
they
could
speak
with
the
commanding
officer
and
when
he
came
to
their
prison
for
the
interview
they
said
for
sake
do
anything
in
future
with
us
that
you
see
fit
condemn
us
to
any
kind
of
punishment
put
balls
and
chains
on
all
of
us
but
whatever
you
do
in
case
of
another
attack
let
us
out
of
this
hole
and
give
us
a
gun
i
have
known
a
commanding
officer
to
release
every
prisoner
in
the
and
set
aside
their
sentences
forever
after
they
have
shown
their
courage
and
presence
of
mind
in
defending
a
post
from
indians
or
other
perils
such
as
fire
and
storms
the
brave
sergeant
who
had
filled
the
pit
with
his
captures
asked
to
follow
a
deserter
who
had
escaped
to
a
settlement
on
the
saline
river
he
found
the
man
arrested
him
and
brought
him
away
unaided
when
they
reached
the
railway
at
ellsworth
the
man
made
a
plea
of
hunger
and
the
sergeant
took
him
to
an
while
standing
at
the
counter
he
took
the
cover
from
a
box
and
furtively
watching
his
chance
threw
the
contents
into
the
sergeant
eyes
completely
blinding
him
the
sergeant
was
then
accounted
second
only
to
wild
bill
as
a
shot
and
not
a
whit
less
cool
though
groaning
with
agony
he
lost
none
of
his
listening
for
the
footfall
as
the
deserter
started
for
the
door
he
fired
in
the
direction
and
the
man
fell
dead
our
regiment
was
now
passing
through
its
worst
days
constant
scouting
over
the
plains
by
men
who
were
as
yet
unacclimated
and
learning
by
the
severest
lessons
to
inure
themselves
to
hardships
made
terrible
havoc
in
the
ranks
the
horses
also
fresh
to
this
sort
of
service
grew
gaunt
and
dragged
their
miserably
fed
bodies
over
the
blistering
trail
here
and
there
along
the
line
a
trooper
walked
beside
his
beast
wetting
when
he
could
the
flesh
that
was
raw
from
the
chafing
of
the
saddle
especially
when
the
rider
is
a
novice
in
horsemanship
insubordination
among
the
men
was
the
certain
consequence
of
the
discouraged
state
they
were
in
one
good
fight
would
have
put
heart
into
them
to
some
extent
for
the
hopelessness
of
following
such
a
as
the
indians
were
that
year
made
them
think
their
scouting
did
no
good
and
might
as
well
be
discontinued
some
of
the
officers
were
poor
disciplinarians
either
from
inexperience
or
because
they
lacked
the
gift
of
control
over
others
which
seems
left
out
of
certain
temperaments
alas
some
had
no
control
over
themselves
and
no
one
could
expect
obedience
in
such
a
case
in
its
early
days
the
seventh
cavalry
was
not
the
temperate
regiment
it
afterward
became
some
of
the
soldiers
in
the
ranks
had
been
officers
during
the
war
and
they
were
learning
the
lesson
that
hard
summer
of
receiving
orders
instead
of
issuing
them
there
were
a
good
many
men
who
had
served
in
the
confederate
army
and
had
not
a
ray
of
patriotism
in
enlisting
it
was
merely
a
question
of
subsistence
to
them
in
their
beggared
condition
there
were
troopers
who
had
entered
the
service
from
a
romantic
love
of
adventure
with
little
idea
of
what
stuff
a
man
must
be
made
if
he
is
hourly
in
peril
or
what
taxes
the
nerves
still
more
continually
called
upon
to
endure
privation
the
mines
were
evidently
the
great
object
that
induced
the
soldier
to
enlist
that
year
the
eastern
papers
had
wild
accounts
of
the
enormous
yield
in
the
rocky
mountains
and
free
transportation
by
government
could
be
gained
by
enlisting
at
that
time
when
the
railroad
was
incomplete
and
travel
almost
given
up
on
account
of
danger
to
the
stages
when
the
telegraph
which
now
reaches
the
destination
of
the
rogue
with
its
warning
far
in
advance
of
him
had
not
even
been
projected
over
the
plains
it
was
the
easiest
sort
of
escape
for
a
man
for
when
once
he
reached
the
mines
he
was
lost
for
years
and
perhaps
died
undiscovered
recruits
of
the
kind
sent
to
us
would
even
under
favorable
circumstances
be
difficult
material
from
which
to
evolve
soldierly
men
and
considering
their
terrible
hardships
it
was
no
wonder
the
regiment
was
nearly
decimated
in
enlisting
the
recruit
rarely
realizes
the
trial
that
awaits
him
of
surrendering
his
independence
we
hear
and
know
so
much
in
this
country
of
freedom
that
even
a
tramp
appreciates
it
if
a
man
is
reasonably
subordinate
it
is
still
very
hard
to
become
accustomed
to
the
infinitesimal
observances
that
i
have
so
often
been
told
are
absolutely
necessary
to
good
order
and
military
discipline
to
a
like
me
it
seemed
very
much
like
reducing
men
to
machines
the
men
made
so
much
trouble
on
the
campaign
and
we
knew
of
it
by
the
many
letters
that
came
into
garrison
in
one
mail
as
well
as
by
personal
observation
when
in
the
regiment
that
i
did
not
find
much
sympathy
in
my
heart
for
them
in
one
night
while
i
was
at
fort
hays
forty
men
deserted
and
in
so
bold
and
deliberate
a
manner
taking
arms
ammunition
horses
and
quantities
of
food
that
the
officers
were
roused
to
action
for
it
looked
as
if
not
enough
men
would
be
left
to
protect
the
fort
a
conspiracy
was
formed
among
the
men
by
which
a
third
of
the
whole
command
planned
to
desert
at
one
time
had
not
their
plotting
been
discovered
there
would
not
have
been
a
safe
hour
for
those
who
remained
as
the
indians
lay
in
wait
constantly
my
husband
in
writing
of
that
wholesale
desertion
in
the
early
months
of
the
regiment
history
makes
some
excuse
for
them
even
under
circumstances
that
would
seem
to
have
put
all
tribulation
and
patience
out
of
mind
after
weary
marches
the
regiment
found
itself
nearing
fort
wallace
with
a
sense
of
relief
feeling
that
they
might
halt
and
recruit
in
that
miserable
but
comparatively
safe
post
they
were
met
by
the
news
of
the
ravages
of
the
cholera
no
time
could
be
worse
for
the
soldiers
to
encounter
it
the
long
trying
campaign
even
extending
into
the
department
of
the
platte
had
fatigued
and
disheartened
the
command
exhaustion
and
made
the
men
an
easy
prey
the
climate
though
so
hot
in
summer
had
heretofore
been
in
their
favor
as
the
air
was
pure
and
in
ordinary
weather
bracing
but
with
cholera
even
the
high
altitude
was
no
protection
no
one
could
account
for
the
appearance
of
the
pestilence
never
before
or
since
had
it
been
known
in
so
elevated
a
part
of
our
country
there
were
those
who
attributed
the
scourge
to
the
upturning
of
the
earth
in
the
building
of
the
kansas
pacific
railroad
but
the
engineers
had
not
even
been
able
to
prospect
as
far
as
wallace
on
account
of
the
indians
an
infantry
regiment
on
its
march
to
new
mexico
halted
at
fort
wallace
and
even
in
their
brief
stay
the
men
were
stricken
down
and
with
inefficient
nurses
no
comforts
not
even
wholesome
food
it
was
a
wonder
that
there
was
enough
of
the
regiment
left
for
an
organization
the
wife
of
one
of
the
officers
staying
temporarily
in
a
fell
a
victim
and
died
in
the
wretched
underground
habitation
in
which
an
eastern
farmer
would
refuse
to
shelter
his
stock
it
was
a
hard
fate
for
our
seventh
cavalry
men
their
camp
outside
the
garrison
had
no
protection
from
the
remorseless
sun
and
the
poor
fellows
rolled
on
the
hot
earth
in
their
small
tents
without
a
cup
of
cold
water
or
a
morsel
of
decent
food
the
surgeons
fought
day
and
night
to
stay
the
spread
of
the
disease
but
everything
was
against
them
the
exhausted
soldiers
disheartened
by
long
hard
unsuccessful
marching
had
little
desire
to
live
when
once
seized
by
the
awful
disease
with
the
celerity
with
which
evil
news
travels
much
of
what
i
have
written
came
back
to
us
though
the
mails
were
so
uncertain
and
travel
was
almost
discontinued
still
the
story
of
the
illness
and
desperate
condition
of
our
regiment
reached
us
and
many
a
garbled
and
exaggerated
tale
came
with
the
true
ones
day
after
day
i
sat
on
the
gallery
of
the
quarters
in
which
we
were
temporarily
established
watching
for
the
first
sign
of
the
cavalryman
who
brought
our
mail
doubtless
he
thought
himself
a
winged
mercury
in
reality
no
snail
ever
crept
so
slowly
when
he
began
his
walk
toward
me
measuring
his
regulation
steps
with
military
precision
a
world
of
fretful
impatience
possessed
me
i
wished
with
all
my
soul
i
was
for
the
moment
any
one
but
the
wife
of
his
commanding
officer
that
i
might
pick
up
my
skirts
and
fly
over
the
grass
and
snatch
the
parcel
from
his
hand
when
he
finally
reached
the
gallery
and
swung
himself
into
position
to
salute
my
heart
thumped
like
the
infantry
drum
day
after
day
came
the
same
pompous
maddening
words
i
have
the
honor
to
report
there
are
no
letters
for
george
armstrong
custer
not
caring
at
last
whether
the
man
saw
the
flush
of
disappointment
the
choking
breath
and
the
rising
tears
i
fled
in
the
midst
of
his
slow
announcement
to
plunge
my
wretched
head
into
my
pillow
hoping
the
sound
of
the
sobs
would
not
reach
eliza
who
was
generally
hovering
near
to
propose
something
that
would
comfort
me
in
my
disappointment
she
knew
work
was
my
panacea
and
made
an
injured
mouth
over
the
rent
in
her
apron
which
in
her
desires
to
keep
me
occupied
she
was
not
above
tearing
on
purpose
with
complaining
tones
she
said
miss
libbie
you
goin
to
do
no
sewin
for
me
at
all
like
every
darkey
in
garrison
has
mo
than
i
has
forgetting
in
her
zeal
the
abbreviation
of
her
words
about
which
her
ole
miss
had
warned
her
sewing
reading
painting
any
occupation
that
had
beguiled
the
hours
lost
its
power
as
those
letterless
days
came
and
went
i
was
even
afraid
to
show
my
face
at
the
door
when
the
was
due
for
i
began
to
despair
about
hearing
at
all
after
days
of
such
gloom
my
leaden
heart
one
morning
quickened
its
beats
at
an
unusual
sound
the
clank
of
a
sabre
on
our
gallery
and
with
it
the
quick
springing
steps
of
feet
unlike
the
quiet
infantry
around
us
the
door
behind
which
i
paced
uneasily
opened
and
with
a
flood
of
sunshine
that
poured
in
came
a
vision
far
brighter
than
even
the
brilliant
kansas
sun
there
before
me
blithe
and
buoyant
stood
my
husband
in
an
instant
every
moment
of
the
preceding
months
was
obliterated
what
had
i
to
ask
more
what
did
earth
hold
for
us
greater
than
what
we
then
had
the
general
as
usual
when
happy
and
excited
talked
so
rapidly
that
the
words
jumbled
themselves
into
hopeless
tangles
but
my
ears
were
keen
enough
to
extract
from
the
medley
the
fact
that
i
was
to
return
at
once
with
him
eliza
half
crying
scolding
as
she
did
when
overjoyed
vibrated
between
kitchen
and
parlor
and
finally
fell
to
cooking
as
a
for
her
overcharged
spirits
the
general
ordered
everything
she
had
in
the
house
determined
for
once
in
that
summer
of
deprivations
to
have
as
the
soldiers
term
it
one
good
square
meal
after
a
time
when
my
reason
was
again
enthroned
i
began
to
ask
what
good
fortune
had
brought
him
to
me
it
seems
that
my
husband
after
reaching
fort
wallace
was
overwhelmed
with
the
discouragements
that
met
him
his
men
dying
about
him
without
his
being
able
to
afford
them
relief
was
something
impossible
for
him
to
face
without
a
struggle
for
their
assistance
a
greater
danger
than
all
was
yet
to
be
encountered
if
the
right
measures
were
not
taken
immediately
even
the
wretched
food
was
better
than
starvation
and
so
much
of
that
had
been
destroyed
with
the
hope
of
the
arrival
of
better
that
there
was
not
enough
left
to
ration
the
men
and
unless
more
came
they
would
starve
as
they
were
out
then
two
hundred
miles
from
the
railroad
if
a
scout
was
sent
his
progress
was
so
slow
hiding
all
day
and
traveling
only
by
night
it
would
take
so
long
that
there
might
be
men
dying
from
hunger
as
well
as
cholera
before
he
could
return
with
aid
and
besides
this
scarcity
of
food
the
medical
supplies
were
insufficient
the
general
prompt
always
in
action
suddenly
determined
to
relieve
the
beleaguered
place
by
going
himself
for
medicines
and
rations
he
took
a
hundred
men
to
guard
the
wagons
that
would
bring
relief
to
the
suffering
and
in
hours
they
were
at
fort
hays
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
distant
it
was
a
terrible
journey
he
afterward
made
a
march
of
eighty
miles
in
seventeen
hours
without
the
horses
showing
themselves
fagged
and
during
the
war
he
had
marched
a
portion
of
his
division
of
cavalry
accompanied
by
horse
artillery
ninety
miles
in
hours
my
husband
finding
i
had
been
sent
away
from
fort
hays
and
believing
me
to
be
at
fort
harker
a
victim
of
cholera
determined
to
push
on
there
at
night
leaving
the
train
for
supplies
to
travel
the
distance
next
day
colonel
custer
and
colonel
cook
accompanied
him
they
found
the
garrison
in
the
deepest
misery
the
cholera
raging
at
its
worst
the
gloom
and
hopelessness
appalling
my
husband
left
the
two
officers
to
load
the
wagons
and
fortunately
as
the
railroad
had
reached
fort
harker
the
medical
and
commissary
supplies
were
abundant
it
took
but
a
few
hours
to
reach
fort
riley
he
knew
from
former
experience
that
i
would
require
but
a
short
time
to
get
ready
indeed
my
letters
were
full
of
assurances
that
i
lived
from
hour
to
hour
with
the
one
hope
that
i
might
join
him
and
these
letters
had
met
him
at
forts
hays
and
harker
he
knew
well
that
nothing
we
might
encounter
could
equal
the
desolation
and
suspense
of
the
days
that
i
was
enduring
at
fort
riley
my
little
valise
was
filled
long
before
it
was
necessary
for
us
to
take
the
return
train
that
evening
with
the
joy
the
relief
the
gratitude
of
knowing
that
god
had
spared
my
husband
through
an
indian
campaign
and
averted
from
him
the
cholera
and
now
that
i
was
to
be
given
reprieve
from
days
of
anxiety
and
nights
of
hideous
dreams
of
what
might
befall
him
and
that
i
would
be
taken
back
to
camp
could
more
be
crowded
into
one
day
was
there
room
for
a
thought
save
one
of
devout
thankfulness
and
such
happiness
as
i
find
no
words
to
describe
there
was
in
that
summer
of
one
long
perfect
day
it
was
mine
and
blessed
be
our
memory
which
preserves
to
us
the
joys
as
well
as
the
sadness
of
life
it
is
still
mine
for
time
and
for
eternity
