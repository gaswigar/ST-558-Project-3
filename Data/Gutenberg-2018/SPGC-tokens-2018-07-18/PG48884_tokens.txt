a
note
balzac
in
gratitude
to
the
duchesse
de
dino
for
her
friendship
and
unfailing
kindness
to
him
one
day
presented
her
with
the
story
of
masque
love
in
a
mask
in
his
own
handwriting
the
duchess
was
one
of
the
few
french
aristocrats
who
in
balzac
time
welcomed
untitled
authors
to
their
salons
and
her
library
boasted
many
such
offerings
from
the
literary
men
of
her
day
she
placed
unpublished
book
on
her
shelves
by
the
side
of
similarly
unpublished
poems
by
alfred
de
musset
and
stories
by
eugene
sue
and
others
the
balzac
manuscript
was
incased
in
a
finely
tooled
binding
of
great
richness
and
beauty
bearing
the
of
the
ducal
family
for
more
than
half
a
century
the
manuscript
remained
where
the
duchess
had
placed
it
then
her
son
maurice
de
the
present
duc
de
dino
made
it
a
present
to
his
friend
the
learned
lucien
aubanel
by
him
it
was
given
to
gillequin
with
the
suggestion
that
it
be
published
and
it
accordingly
appeared
in
print
for
the
first
time
in
march
the
duc
de
dino
in
a
letter
written
to
gillequin
on
this
occasion
guaranteed
the
history
of
the
volume
which
for
so
long
had
been
one
of
the
treasured
possessions
of
his

love
in
a
mask
or
imprudence
and
happiness
i
midnight
was
striking
and
all
paris
was
astir
the
streets
were
filled
with
people
bent
on
merrymaking
it
was
the
eve
of
shrove
tuesday
léon
de
préval
a
young
cavalry
officer
had
just
made
his
way
into
the
opera
ball
there
for
over
an
hour
he
wandered
aimlessly
amid
the
throng
that
seethed
forward
and
backward
finding
no
one
he
knew
and
quite
failing
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
the
stupid
greetings
flung
at
him
from
time
to
time
by
the
women
he
passed
finally
choked
with
dust
overcome
with
heat
dizzy
with
the
ceaseless
buzz
of
all
these
specters
he
asked
himself
impatiently
whether
this
were
indeed
pleasure
and
turned
to
find
the
door
at
that
moment
two
masked
women
came
down
the
steps
into
the
ballroom
both
were
strikingly
graceful
and
both
were
strikingly
well
dressed
they
were
accompanied
by
a
genial
looking
man
without
a
mask
a
little
murmur
of
admiration
greeted
them
and
a
band
of
giddy
youths
fell
in
behind
them
hurling
flippant
compliments
and
extravagant
gallantries
at
the
two
masks
léon
followed
with
the
rest
at
every
step
the
curiosity
of
the
crowd
added
to
the
numbers
of
the
little
procession
soon
it
encountered
a
group
of
masqueraders
themselves
the
center
of
a
cortège
who
coming
from
the
opposite
direction
threw
such
confusion
into
the
ranks
that
one
of
the
ladies
the
younger
looking
of
the
two
was
separated
from
her
friends
glancing
anxiously
around
her
in
search
of
a
protector
her
eyes
fell
on
léon
who
was
following
her
movements
with
a
good
deal
of
interest
and
hastily
seizing
his
arm
oh
i
implore
you
she
said
nervously
using
the
familiar
get
us
out
of
this
and
help
me
find
my
friends
i
am
at
your
service
lovely
mask
do
be
afraid
trust
yourself
to
me
and
come
with
me
and
with
the
lady
clinging
to
one
arm
with
the
other
he
cleared
a
way
for
her
through
the
press
bringing
her
safely
out
at
last
to
the
cloak
room
there
he
seated
her
on
a
bench
and
volunteered
to
go
to
find
her
some
refreshments
no
stay
with
me
she
said
i
do
want
anything
i
am
really
ashamed
to
have
given
way
to
such
foolish
terror
ah
but
i
am
ready
to
bless
the
cause
without
it
i
should
not
have
known
the
happiness
of
being
chosen
by
you
to
protect
you
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
you
have
rendered
me
a
great
service
and
i
am
grateful
i
will
even
implore
you
to
continue
to
extend
your
protection
until
we
can
find
my
friends
what
you
want
to
leave
me
already
ah
if
only
from
gratitude
grant
me
a
few
minutes
well
then
as
a
reward
i
will
stay
a
few
minutes
with
you
they
sat
down
side
by
side
and
the
time
sped
swiftly
while
they
chatted
gaily
lightly
together
at
last
the
charming
mask
bethought
herself
once
more
of
her
missing
party
but
who
are
these
friends
of
yours
said
léon
is
it
your
mother
or
sister
and
perhaps
a
husband
a
husband
no
indeed
thank
god
you
are
not
married
no
not
now
what
already
a
widow
how
sorry
i
am
for
you
pray
why
should
you
suppose
that
i
am
to
be
pitied
are
all
husbands
so
kind
are
all
men
so
tender
is
there
on
the
contrary
one
who
deserves
to
be
regretted
oh
what
an
anathema
he
is
a
happy
fellow
who
succeeds
in
inspiring
you
with
juster
milder
feelings
toward
men
heaven
forbid
then
you
are
determined
to
drive
to
despair
all
the
troop
of
admirers
who
no
doubt
i
have
one
i
have
just
arrived
from
the
other
side
of
the
world
and
know
nobody
here
nobody
really
then
fair
mask
i
put
myself
down
as
your
first
and
you
will
see
that
i
shall
be
ever
the
most
devoted
the
most
constant
constant
if
it
is
in
that
strain
you
are
going
to
talk
i
shall
leave
you
forthwith
what
does
constancy
constancy
is
but
a
chain
that
we
pretend
to
wear
in
order
to
impose
its
weight
on
another
now
that
i
am
free
perfectly
free
i
intend
to
remain
so
no
man
living
could
induce
me
to
forswear
myself
there
is
no
more
freedom
for
me
i
feel
that
but
i
can
not
regret
it
the
chain
shall
however
be
for
me
only
you
can
not
prevent
my
loving
you
or
hoping
ah
no
no
no
monsieur
i
do
not
want
love
i
do
not
want
promises
and
least
of
all
do
i
want
any
one
to
hope
for
anything
from
me
but
cruel
mask
incomprehensible
mask
what
then
you
want
what
must
one
do
to
obtain
at
least
your
pity
one
must
neither
rave
nor
deceive
neither
exaggerate
a
feeling
of
which
he
is
barely
conscious
nor
fancy
it
possible
to
induce
a
sensible
woman
to
change
her
plans
for
a
few
romantic
words
or
hypocritical
attentions
one
must
be
humble
discreet
patient
i
must
have
time
to
make
up
my
mind
to
find
out
exactly
what
i
want
and
then
perhaps
then
perhaps
what
charming
mask
finish
the
sentence
let
me
know
my
fate
i
will
be
obedient
silence
submission
patience
i
promise
everything
as
he
spoke
léon
face
glowed
with
love
and
hope
and
he
gazed
eagerly
into
the
large
black
eyes
which
soft
and
sparkling
appeared
to
be
studying
him
with
calm
and
close
scrutiny
entirely
disregarding
his
impassioned
tones
she
went
on
with
a
thoughtful
air
this
gold
braid
must
betoken
a
grade
you
are
in
the
service
no
doubt
confounded
by
her
léon
could
only
reply
by
a
gesture
of
assent
in
what
regiment
i
am
captain
in
the
sixth
horse
he
replied
a
little
hurt
you
are
on
furlough
perhaps
does
your
family
live
in
this
city
no
my
people
belong
to
a
distant
part
of
the
country
they
are
far
from
rich
but
they
are
honorable
and
highly
respected
i
only
came
up
with
my
regiment
and
like
you
lovely
mask
have
been
but
a
few
days
in
the
capital
like
you
too
i
know
no
one
here
like
you
i
am
free
with
no
attachments
and
no
ties
fate
seems
to
have
brought
me
here
to
lose
at
one
blow
my
heart
my
liberty
and
my
peace
of
mind
and
find
in
return
of
course
nothing
but
a
ungrateful
woman
these
are
the
conventional
things
that
we
all
say
now
i
am
going
to
do
justice
to
chance
that
is
at
times
kind
to
us
and
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
it
has
been
so
this
time
in
bringing
us
two
together
it
may
be
that
i
shall
have
it
to
thank
for
the
one
blessing
that
was
lacking
in
my
life
adorable
and
mysterious
lady
if
only
i
could
fall
at
your
feet
and
there
swear
that
henceforth
léon
de
préval
grateful
and
humble
will
do
all
in
his
power
to
merit
so
sweet
an
avowal
an
avowal
she
said
you
call
that
an
avowal
did
one
ever
see
anything
to
equal
the
presumption
of
these
men
but
how
can
one
help
believing
a
little
in
what
one
so
fondly
hopes
may
i
not
know
who
is
the
fascinating
creature
that
takes
a
pleasure
in
teasing
me
may
i
not
raise
the
mask
that
hides
the
features
which
perhaps
are
not
so
very
plain
if
only
i
might
see
them
for
a
moment
if
i
might
but
read
there
ca
you
read
all
you
need
to
know
in
my
eyes
they
are
bewitching
but
suppose
a
sweet
smile
went
with
them
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
in
a
colder
more
serious
manner
she
said
no
you
will
never
see
me
never
know
me
and
never
will
you
learn
anything
about
me
léon
stood
as
though
petrified
did
one
ever
hear
of
such
inconceivable
caprice
it
is
useless
madame
for
me
to
trouble
you
any
longer
i
see
you
are
anxious
to
rejoin
your
friends
we
must
look
for
them
she
interrupted
him
not
noticing
his
anger
léon
de
préval
that
your
name
is
it
she
said
dreamily
captain
of
the
sixth
horse
do
you
expect
to
stay
long
in
the
city
what
can
that
matter
to
you
cruel
one
since
you
do
not
mean
to
see
me
ever
again
but
what
makes
you
think
i
do
mean
to
see
you
again
how
little
it
takes
to
throw
these
wiseacres
off
their
balance
i
am
on
the
contrary
so
determined
to
see
you
again
that
my
dear
what
ever
has
become
of
you
cried
a
voice
behind
them
we
have
been
hunting
for
you
these
two
hours
past
it
was
the
friend
and
escort
of
the
pretty
mask
thus
suddenly
brought
together
again
each
in
turn
ran
quickly
over
the
incidents
of
the
night
i
am
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
bored
to
death
said
the
lady
who
had
just
arrived
upon
the
scene
for
pity
sake
let
us
go
home
with
all
my
heart
there
is
nothing
to
keep
me
here
any
longer
what
so
soon
exclaimed
léon
at
least
you
will
not
forbid
me
to
accompany
you
to
your
carriage
this
favor
was
granted
and
the
pair
followed
the
others
out
of
the
hall
be
merciful
said
léon
and
finish
the
charming
sentence
you
had
begun
when
we
were
so
annoyingly
interrupted
we
were
talking
of
meeting
again
but
when
where
and
how
think
that
in
a
minute
more
i
shall
have
lost
everything
but
the
remembrance
of
you
will
you
not
leave
me
a
little
hope
ah
then
he
has
got
over
his
fit
of
temper
do
not
play
with
me
now
i
am
about
to
lose
you
how
shall
i
be
able
to
well
there
is
just
the
possibility
that
i
may
come
to
the
ball
here
three
weeks
to
wait
ye
gods
three
centuries
yes
three
weeks
perhaps
and
perhaps
never
i
shall
be
dead
by
that
time
dead
with
impatience
and
worry
that
will
entirely
upset
my
plans
your
plans
but
they
had
reached
the
door
a
carriage
had
just
drawn
up
but
in
the
darkness
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
either
its
color
or
its
coat
of
arms
a
black
servant
was
holding
the
door
open
may
i
not
at
least
cherish
the
hope
that
you
will
be
sorry
for
my
sufferings
indeed
i
fancy
you
are
going
to
occupy
my
mind
considerably
as
she
finished
speaking
she
sprang
lightly
into
the
carriage
and
the
horses
dashed
rapidly
off
léon
stood
and
gazed
after
that
coach
which
was
carrying
away
from
him
his
new
conquest
and
caring
no
more
for
the
ball
he
made
his
way
homeward
his
brain
in
confusion
his
heart
a
little
troubled
his
mind
ran
upon
his
adventure
and
he
reproached
himself
bitterly
for
not
having
found
some
means
of
carrying
it
a
little
farther
who
can
she
be
he
said
to
himself
so
attractive
and
so
odd
she
can
not
be
a
with
that
noble
bearing
at
once
modest
and
proud
and
with
such
unmistakable
ease
of
manner
what
can
she
want
and
why
should
she
alternately
encourage
and
repel
me
she
talked
of
her
plans
and
wanted
to
know
all
sorts
of
details
about
me
our
meeting
might
prove
a
happy
thing
for
her
yet
i
am
never
to
see
her
again
and
must
never
know
who
she
is
was
she
only
playing
with
me
if
i
thought
that
what
a
revenge
i
would
take
but
pray
how
and
on
whom
she
may
not
come
to
the
next
ball
i
may
have
lost
all
trace
of
her
forever
i
should
be
sorry
for
i
am
convinced
that
she
is
charming
what
a
soft
sensuousness
there
is
in
her
pretty
flexible
figure
what
beautiful
eyes
she
has
and
what
an
expressive
voice
and
such
a
graceful
witty
way
of
talking
these
three
weeks
are
going
to
be
endless
i
had
better
spend
them
in
looking
for
and
finding
her
it
might
be
as
well
to
get
some
sleep
in
the
first
place
but
there
was
no
sleep
for
léon
that
night
at
an
early
hour
he
rose
and
began
at
once
his
search
ii
the
whole
of
the
first
week
was
spent
in
searching
the
streets
shops
theaters
and
in
following
up
every
woman
who
seemed
to
bear
the
faintest
resemblance
to
the
stranger
committing
a
thousand
blunders
and
many
impertinences
with
no
other
result
than
to
prove
to
himself
the
utter
uselessness
of
his
attempt
the
second
week
found
him
thoroughly
disheartened
and
in
the
course
of
the
third
he
began
to
wonder
how
much
longer
he
was
going
to
act
as
a
puppet
in
the
hands
of
a
coquette
who
was
perhaps
only
concealing
herself
from
his
eyes
in
order
to
enjoy
the
sight
of
his
discomfiture
then
one
day
a
missive
was
left
at
his
door
containing
these
words
de
préval
will
of
course
remember
that
he
is
expected
on
thursday
at
the
opera
ball
at
one
under
the
clock
as
he
read
his
hopes
were
fired
anew
on
the
day
appointed
midnight
had
scarcely
struck
when
léon
took
up
his
position
beneath
the
clock
consumed
with
amorous
impatience
and
keen
curiosity
a
long
hour
had
slipped
away
when
at
length
the
white
domino
flitted
by
she
bowed
slightly
and
slackening
her
pace
to
allow
her
companions
to
pass
on
before
her
she
accepted
the
arm
that
léon
had
sprung
up
to
offer
her
delighted
to
meet
her
again
beside
himself
with
hope
and
happiness
he
gently
pressed
her
round
arm
to
his
side
and
described
in
eloquent
terms
all
the
sufferings
of
the
last
few
days
his
vain
search
his
fears
his
impatience
quietly
she
listened
then
suddenly
interrupted
him
well
i
fared
better
than
you
she
said
for
i
found
out
at
once
all
i
wanted
to
know
about
you
about
me
yes
indeed
i
found
all
you
had
told
me
was
strictly
true
but
i
learned
in
addition
that
you
are
popular
with
your
comrades
and
that
your
superior
officers
think
highly
of
you
they
say
moreover
that
you
are
capable
of
acting
honestly
by
women
and
might
even
be
trusted
to
keep
any
promise
extorted
from
you
that
would
be
merely
my
duty
do
please
let
us
talk
about
my
happiness
have
you
really
been
thinking
about
me
is
it
possible
you
were
sufficiently
interested
in
me
to
hope
i
might
be
worthy
your
regard
and
to
try
to
find
out
but
i
had
to
if
i
meant
to
carry
out
my
plans
ah
those
plans
of
yours
i
hope
i
am
now
going
to
hear
what
they
are
kind
mask
go
on
do
i
beseech
you
trust
the
fortunate
mortal
whose
heart
already
beats
for
you
alone
and
who
is
only
waiting
a
word
from
you
to
give
himself
to
you
forever
i
should
be
very
sorry
she
exclaimed
hastily
for
a
few
moments
léon
was
silenced
oh
he
said
at
last
do
not
play
this
cruel
game
with
me
any
longer
why
tease
me
with
alternate
kindness
and
coldness
this
is
the
last
of
these
balls
but
do
not
think
to
escape
me
again
i
shall
dog
your
footsteps
and
follow
you
until
you
promise
to
meet
me
again
and
give
me
an
opportunity
to
lay
my
heart
and
my
hopes
at
your
feet
and
hear
from
you
what
these
plans
can
be
oh
no
no
i
must
first
be
quite
sure
of
your
reasonableness
and
prudence
there
are
certain
conditions
i
shall
have
to
impose
and
your
word
of
honor
duly
signed
and
sealed
must
be
my
guarantee
of
their
fulfilment
my
word
of
honor
my
signature
said
léon
considerably
astonished
at
her
precautions
and
also
at
the
solemnity
she
seemed
to
attach
to
a
treaty
made
at
the
opera
ball
he
looked
down
at
his
companion
she
was
clearly
embarrassed
and
meditative
her
bosom
heaved
with
obvious
agitation
and
he
almost
fancied
he
could
detect
a
blush
beneath
her
mask
she
on
her
side
was
abstractedly
watching
him
and
seemed
perplexed
and
doubtful
convinced
that
the
moment
had
come
when
with
a
little
pressure
she
would
give
way
léon
went
on
eagerly
charming
but
inexplicable
creature
well
then
i
consent
to
whatever
you
ask
and
i
will
renew
the
vow
i
made
at
the
last
ball
to
be
obedient
docile
and
discreet
i
accept
your
conditions
beforehand
if
you
in
return
will
leave
me
the
joy
of
hoping
to
meet
you
again
and
holding
finally
in
my
arms
her
it
must
be
so
she
murmured
absently
apparently
replying
rather
to
some
thought
in
her
own
mind
than
to
what
he
was
saying
but
léon
noticed
only
her
words
and
they
completely
turned
his
head
oh
how
glad
i
am
he
cried
let
us
go
away
dear
unknown
lady
perfect
my
happiness
by
coming
away
with
me
out
of
this
tiresome
crowd
let
us
go
where
i
can
tear
off
this
odious
mask
and
take
your
commands
then
in
greater
freedom
than
is
possible
here
let
me
pay
love
debt
as
he
spoke
he
drew
her
gently
forward
but
suddenly
she
paused
withdrew
her
arm
and
regaining
the
haughty
carriage
that
seemed
natural
to
her
she
said
in
a
calm
cold
voice
you
are
strangely
mistaken
de
préval
your
rash
transports
and
vain
declarations
offend
and
hurt
me
believe
me
i
am
not
what
you
dare
to
think
and
i
am
entitled
to
more
consideration
greater
respect
and
more
prudence
from
you
i
am
going
to
overlook
this
offense
however
because
i
admit
that
my
own
odd
behavior
might
well
have
misled
you
but
you
must
do
all
i
tell
you
tomorrow
you
shall
hear
from
me
and
i
will
then
let
you
know
exactly
what
conditions
i
mean
to
make
till
then
be
patient
and
resign
yourself
as
she
spoke
she
moved
away
into
the
crowd
intending
to
give
him
the
slip
but
he
dashed
after
her
in
pursuit
no
he
cried
i
am
not
going
to
leave
you
you
shall
not
run
away
like
this
cruel
creature
you
touch
my
heart
set
my
imagination
on
fire
and
then
forsake
me
take
me
to
my
carriage
she
said
and
in
her
voice
there
rang
a
note
of
command
he
grasped
the
hand
she
offered
and
again
poured
forth
his
lamentations
and
prayers
but
all
to
no
effect
the
faithful
negro
was
standing
at
the
door
the
stranger
quickly
entered
her
carriage
saying
to
léon
till
tomorrow
you
may
rely
on
my
promise
at
least
permit
me
to
see
you
home
he
said
his
foot
on
the
step
close
the
door
and
drive
home
she
said
energetically
her
order
was
instantly
obeyed
and
once
again
léon
saw
his
hopes
vanish
with
her
who
had
inspired
them
iii
the
impatience
with
which
léon
waited
for
the
morrow
may
be
more
easily
imagined
than
described
how
often
did
he
run
up
to
his
rooms
to
see
if
the
letter
had
yet
arrived
how
delighted
he
was
when
at
last
it
was
handed
to
him
but
what
was
his
astonishment
to
read
these
words
yesterday
de
préval
appeared
keenly
to
desire
to
see
again
the
lady
in
the
white
domino
whom
he
met
at
the
opera
ball
to
obtain
this
favor
he
declared
himself
ready
to
do
anything
she
asked
of
him
here
are
the
conditions
on
which
he
may
have
what
he
so
persistently
demanded
de
préval
must
be
in
his
rooms
at
midnight
tomorrow
a
trustworthy
man
whom
he
has
already
seen
once
will
call
for
him
with
a
hired
carriage
which
will
convey
him
to
his
destination
only
de
préval
must
allow
his
eyes
to
be
blindfolded
he
must
refrain
from
questioning
his
guide
and
must
not
attempt
to
bribe
him
this
would
be
quite
useless
but
he
must
quietly
follow
instructions
he
must
promise
to
make
no
noise
and
no
scandal
he
must
not
make
a
fuss
about
the
darkness
and
must
not
attempt
to
induce
the
person
who
will
be
waiting
for
him
to
break
the
silence
she
has
determined
to
keep
finally
when
his
guide
returns
to
fetch
him
he
must
follow
him
out
to
the
carriage
and
thence
homeward
with
the
same
precautions
and
afterward
without
making
vain
attempts
to
discover
what
is
to
be
done
with
him
he
must
patiently
await
the
enlightenment
that
is
faithfully
promised
to
him
if
de
préval
accepts
these
conditions
he
can
write
on
the
foot
of
this
sheet
that
he
will
keep
them
add
his
signature
and
leave
it
in
an
envelope
at
his
door
to
wait
till
called
for
when
he
had
read
through
this
extraordinary
document
léon
astonished
beyond
measure
was
torn
by
a
thousand
conflicting
feelings
how
was
he
to
reconcile
the
elaborate
precautions
of
this
strange
compact
with
the
enlightenment
that
was
promised
how
could
he
make
this
appointment
agree
with
the
air
of
lofty
distinction
and
reserve
of
the
stranger
he
told
himself
over
and
over
again
that
it
would
be
the
height
of
folly
and
imprudence
to
sign
such
a
treaty
and
embark
on
such
a
chase
and
yet
as
the
graceful
image
of
the
pretty
mask
rose
before
his
mind
eye
and
their
animated
talk
at
the
ball
recurred
again
to
his
memory
the
contrast
between
her
pride
and
her
weakness
the
piquancy
of
the
situation
his
now
strongly
aroused
curiosity
and
his
vanity
at
stake
all
combined
to
make
up
an
irresistible
temptation
for
a
moment
he
even
fancied
there
might
be
a
spice
of
danger
in
trusting
himself
to
some
unknown
man
to
be
led
to
an
unknown
place
his
hands
tied
by
his
promise
and
his
person
exposed
defenseless
to
all
risks
but
this
prospect
added
savor
to
the
rest
no
indeed
he
cried
i
shall
not
draw
back
now
the
precious
reward
offered
is
well
worth
a
little
folly
and
seizing
a
pen
this
wise
cato
wrote
like
any
harebrained
youth
i
accept
all
the
conditions
imposed
and
undertake
on
my
word
of
honor
to
fulfil
them
scrupulously
i
only
ask
permission
to
wear
my
sword
léon
de
préval
in
the
course
of
the
evening
some
one
called
for
his
answer
and
on
the
following
day
he
received
another
note
containing
these
few
words
he
may
wear
his
sword
but
de
préval
has
nothing
to
fear
for
either
his
honor
or
his
safety
never
was
day
so
long
for
two
hours
léon
ready
dressed
had
been
walking
up
and
down
his
room
when
the
sound
of
a
carriage
drawing
up
to
the
door
brought
his
heart
into
his
mouth
seizing
his
sword
he
ran
rapidly
downstairs
and
found
the
black
servant
standing
there
the
man
motioned
him
to
get
into
the
carriage
and
then
in
his
bad
french
respectfully
asked
permission
to
bandage
his
eyes
léon
made
no
resistance
after
driving
a
short
time
the
negro
ordered
the
coachman
to
stop
and
helped
léon
to
step
out
on
to
the
pavement
together
they
walked
a
few
yards
and
then
entered
a
house
where
they
mounted
a
short
staircase
léon
could
perceive
that
he
was
being
led
through
some
large
rooms
until
they
reached
one
that
was
filled
with
sweet
scents
at
this
moment
his
bandage
was
removed
and
glancing
eagerly
round
he
found
himself
in
a
dark
apartment
at
the
end
of
which
was
an
open
door
that
revealed
an
elegant
boudoir
dimly
lighted
by
an
alabaster
lamp
the
negro
standing
beside
him
with
a
dark
lantern
in
his
hand
pointed
to
the
boudoir
and
in
a
low
tone
uttered
the
words
honor
and
silence
he
then
disappeared
léon
laid
aside
his
sword
and
entered
swiftly
a
woman
his
unknown
friend
dressed
in
a
simple
négligé
her
head
wrapped
in
a
veil
was
half
reclining
on
a
sofa
léon
threw
himself
at
her
feet
i
am
a
happy
man
he
cried
but
what
are
you
still
hiding
your
face
from
me
for
pity
sake
make
no
more
mystery
throw
off
your
veil
as
he
spoke
he
lifted
his
impatient
hand
no
obstacle
was
interposed
but
at
the
same
instant
the
lap
went
out
we
dare
not
throw
light
on
the
darkness
that
léon
respected
we
will
not
infringe
the
order
of
silence
we
will
only
say
that
his
highest
hopes
were
surpassed
by
the
reality
and
in
the
pleasure
of
that
meeting
he
had
no
desire
to
break
his
word
time
passed
quickly
and
the
night
was
far
advanced
when
a
slight
sound
was
heard
in
the
apartment
a
secret
door
had
been
opened
the
stranger
disappeared
and
léon
found
himself
alone
the
negro
stood
again
before
him
and
respectfully
requested
him
to
replace
the
bandage
over
his
eyes
and
follow
him
no
he
replied
both
pained
and
vexed
i
will
not
go
until
i
have
seen
her
until
i
have
obtained
a
woman
voice
interrupted
him
whispering
close
beside
him
honor
and
silence
léon
rushed
toward
the
voice
to
find
only
a
wall
he
groped
along
it
and
came
upon
a
small
door
fastened
on
the
other
side
through
whose
cracks
he
could
distinguish
a
light
that
receded
rapidly
and
then
disappeared
cruel
he
said
not
daring
to
speak
aloud
stop
one
moment
only
one
word
honor
and
silence
said
the
negro
firmly
yes
léon
replied
sadly
i
am
bound
to
honor
i
promised
i
submit
i
can
only
hope
that
others
will
be
as
faithful
to
their
word
as
i
am
to
mine
the
bandage
was
replaced
and
léon
followed
his
guide
out
to
the
carriage
soon
he
was
at
home
again
where
alone
with
his
memories
alternately
delicious
and
sad
happy
and
anxious
he
now
madly
in
love
wondered
if
indeed
the
whole
thing
were
not
a
dream
and
fell
asleep
in
the
hope
of
prolonging
it
iv
but
who
shall
describe
his
anxiety
and
distress
as
the
days
went
by
then
a
week
a
second
and
a
third
with
still
no
news
from
the
stranger
still
she
took
no
trouble
to
soothe
his
impatience
his
mind
dwelt
painfully
on
the
incident
what
he
said
is
it
possible
that
my
loyalty
and
honor
were
invoked
merely
to
satisfy
the
passing
caprice
of
an
unprincipled
and
immoral
woman
no
no
i
am
unjust
to
her
and
ungrateful
too
i
could
feel
her
heart
beating
with
fear
o
my
beloved
lady
why
hide
from
my
love
why
lift
me
to
a
pinnacle
of
bliss
only
to
dash
me
to
earth
again
directly
after
the
memory
of
the
moments
we
spent
together
entirely
absorbs
me
is
it
possible
they
have
no
power
over
you
in
this
apostrophe
to
his
mysterious
belle
léon
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
a
letter
which
seemed
nicely
timed
to
reply
to
it
he
recognized
at
once
the
handwriting
of
the
conditions
and
opened
the
envelope
with
a
hand
that
shook
with
pleasure
this
is
what
he
read
how
many
illusions
i
am
destroying
what
tender
hopes
will
now
be
blighted
what
prestige
dwindle
away
you
think
yourself
the
victor
but
instead
you
are
under
orders
your
vanity
must
have
been
stirred
at
the
thought
of
the
irresistible
influence
you
wielded
over
a
weak
woman
but
it
is
you
who
have
to
obey
her
will
you
are
of
course
waiting
impatiently
to
see
and
know
her
to
establish
your
empire
over
her
by
fresh
transports
on
your
side
and
fresh
weaknesses
on
hers
and
that
moment
will
never
come
all
is
over
between
her
and
you
nevertheless
the
loyalty
and
delicacy
of
your
behavior
deserve
some
recognition
from
me
i
do
think
i
can
better
prove
my
gratitude
than
by
confiding
to
you
those
plans
you
were
so
curious
to
hear
and
explaining
the
conduct
which
must
have
seemed
strange
at
least
in
your
eyes
if
not
imprudent
though
thanks
to
you
i
believe
i
shall
never
have
cause
to
regret
it
an
unequal
match
which
brought
me
only
misery
humiliation
injustice
and
violence
has
left
in
me
an
invincible
repugnance
for
a
tie
that
weighs
heavily
on
the
weak
upholds
the
strong
and
sanctions
injustice
when
therefore
i
found
myself
at
the
age
of
free
wealthy
and
my
own
mistress
i
vowed
to
remain
so
always
but
i
very
soon
discovered
that
i
was
purchasing
my
independence
at
the
price
of
nature
sweetest
solace
when
i
looked
around
me
i
found
not
a
creature
who
needed
my
care
and
tenderness
not
one
to
love
me
and
tell
me
so
i
was
continually
haunted
by
sorrow
for
my
childless
condition
and
by
degrees
this
became
a
real
grief
i
was
born
beneath
a
fierce
sky
and
my
blood
is
hot
my
passions
strong
what
more
can
i
say
i
gradually
came
to
form
the
singular
plan
by
which
i
might
know
the
joys
of
maternity
without
submitting
to
a
hated
yoke
still
do
not
think
me
a
woman
and
do
not
imagine
that
i
scorn
as
prejudices
those
laws
which
i
know
to
be
useful
to
society
no
i
have
the
greatest
respect
for
them
and
if
for
this
time
alone
i
have
dared
to
set
them
aside
believe
me
it
is
for
this
once
only
because
special
circumstances
made
it
possible
for
me
to
save
at
the
same
time
appearances
and
reputation
my
plan
formed
in
the
first
instance
in
fear
and
trembling
soon
occupied
all
my
waking
thought
i
will
confess
that
there
was
a
romantic
glamour
about
it
that
lent
it
an
additional
charm
in
my
eyes
soon
it
grew
to
be
a
passion
you
know
how
i
succeeded
in
putting
it
in
execution
and
to
you
i
shall
owe
the
sole
blessing
that
my
life
lacked
at
first
i
meant
to
leave
you
in
ignorance
of
the
truth
and
forget
you
entirely
now
i
have
changed
my
mind
and
have
come
to
think
that
i
owe
you
some
explanation
moreover
if
my
hopes
are
fulfilled
i
may
die
before
the
object
of
my
affection
is
old
enough
to
take
care
of
itself
it
will
inherit
all
my
fortune
but
i
think
i
ought
not
to
deprive
it
of
its
natural
protector
no
matter
then
where
duty
may
call
you
when
the
time
comes
you
will
receive
from
me
a
split
ring
on
which
there
will
be
engraved
the
date
of
a
birth
the
setting
will
inform
you
of
the
sex
a
diamond
signifying
a
son
an
emerald
a
daughter
the
second
half
of
this
ring
will
be
given
to
the
child
in
the
event
of
my
death
with
all
the
clues
necessary
for
finding
you
out
when
the
second
half
is
placed
in
your
hand
the
fact
of
its
matching
your
own
will
prove
the
right
of
the
bearer
to
your
protection
and
my
personal
regard
for
you
makes
me
very
sure
it
will
not
be
asked
in
vain
adieu
monsieur
adieu
léon
farewell
forever
take
no
steps
to
discover
me
they
would
be
in
vain
since
in
a
few
days
i
shall
be
far
away
forget
a
fantastic
creature
whom
you
do
not
and
must
not
know
forget
the
dream
of
a
single
night
that
can
not
return
be
happy
this
is
my
one
wish
for
you
and
if
i
learn
that
it
has
been
realized
i
shall
be
happy
too
happy
cried
léon
flinging
the
letter
down
angrily
i
am
to
be
happy
when
she
coldly
informs
me
i
am
never
to
see
her
again
when
her
insulting
confidences
just
reveal
the
value
of
the
prize
that
is
lost
to
me
never
to
be
regained
but
let
her
not
think
to
escape
me
altogether
she
is
mine
she
herself
formed
the
tie
between
us
could
she
have
done
it
only
to
sever
it
immediately
wherever
she
goes
i
shall
follow
her
and
everywhere
i
shall
insist
on
my
claims
being
heard
she
can
not
shirk
them
then
after
a
moment
reflection
he
added
alas
i
am
forgetting
that
she
is
going
away
she
is
probably
returning
to
her
own
land
and
the
wide
seas
will
divide
us
unhappy
man
that
i
am
why
did
i
ever
go
to
the
ball
why
was
i
such
a
fool
as
to
accept
her
artful
conditions
the
suddenness
of
the
blow
thus
inflicted
on
his
fondest
hopes
took
such
effect
on
léon
that
for
several
days
he
was
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
go
out
again
he
started
his
search
with
more
energy
than
ever
but
being
himself
a
stranger
in
the
city
there
were
few
means
open
to
him
and
he
soon
found
himself
reduced
to
a
state
of
passive
regret
which
is
perhaps
the
worst
of
all
evils
during
this
period
of
his
life
his
temper
took
on
a
tinge
of
melancholy
which
never
entirely
deserted
him
brought
up
by
an
honorable
family
who
had
instilled
good
principles
into
the
lad
léon
had
never
indulged
in
the
usual
license
of
barracks
his
professional
studies
and
a
succession
of
fatiguing
and
glorious
campaigns
had
left
him
little
leisure
to
form
any
lasting
liaison
though
of
an
affectionate
disposition
he
had
never
loved
and
this
the
first
serious
impression
made
upon
him
was
so
much
the
deeper
in
consequence
and
now
chance
had
thrown
in
his
way
an
attractive
woman
rendered
still
more
piquante
by
the
mystery
with
which
she
had
surrounded
herself
and
she
had
vanished
like
a
shadow
on
the
very
eve
perhaps
of
becoming
a
father
he
was
yet
never
to
be
allowed
to
press
to
his
heart
the
child
of
his
love
united
by
the
tenderest
and
strongest
of
ties
to
persons
visible
only
to
his
imagination
he
was
doomed
never
to
know
them
in
the
flesh
thoughts
such
as
these
left
him
no
peace
yet
after
reading
her
letter
over
and
over
again
he
fancied
he
could
detect
in
it
some
faint
promise
for
the
future
all
hope
of
finding
his
unknown
mistress
was
not
yet
lost
this
enigmatic
ring
that
she
promised
him
and
that
was
to
announce
the
most
passionately
of
events
constituted
in
itself
a
kind
of
correspondence
besides
since
an
arrangement
was
to
be
made
by
which
the
child
should
at
any
time
be
able
to
find
its
father
it
was
evident
that
his
fate
and
existence
must
continue
to
interest
the
mother
and
the
thought
that
the
invisible
stranger
would
be
watching
over
his
fortunes
took
hold
of
his
imagination
and
afforded
him
some
consolation
but
a
fresh
grief
awaited
him
orders
were
given
for
his
regiment
to
go
into
garrison
in
a
small
town
of
the
north
of
france
and
léon
forced
to
accompany
his
men
was
plunged
anew
into
the
depths
of
despair
he
felt
that
in
leaving
paris
he
lost
all
chance
of
discovering
traces
of
her
he
sought
and
that
once
buried
in
the
distant
provinces
he
might
easily
be
forgotten
even
the
message
he
was
awaiting
with
such
impatience
would
perhaps
never
reach
him
there
still
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
leave
and
residence
in
the
little
town
with
no
society
and
no
resource
but
solitary
country
walks
did
not
contribute
greatly
to
relieve
léon
melancholy
mood
v
whilst
léon
brooding
in
dull
exile
over
his
troubles
was
mentally
calculating
the
hours
that
must
elapse
before
the
expected
message
could
be
despatched
his
unknown
friend
also
in
seclusion
but
in
a
charming
estate
situated
on
the
road
from
tours
to
bordeaux
was
freely
indulging
in
those
joyful
anticipations
that
her
audacity
coupled
with
her
warm
eager
blood
had
warranted
in
the
independent
position
in
which
she
now
found
herself
everything
was
new
and
everything
seemed
pleasant
born
in
martinique
and
reared
amongst
a
slave
population
the
youthful
elinor
at
sixteen
had
never
known
any
restraint
but
that
of
her
parents
indulgent
rule
she
had
never
felt
the
salutary
yoke
of
the
hard
and
fast
laws
of
society
but
at
this
period
of
her
life
her
beauty
which
had
begun
to
make
some
stir
in
the
place
aroused
the
admiration
of
de
roselis
the
richest
settler
in
the
island
he
came
forward
to
ask
for
her
hand
and
his
wealth
so
dazzled
her
ambitious
relatives
that
it
was
granted
immediately
he
was
a
man
of
some
forty
years
with
a
handsome
face
but
a
character
as
odious
as
it
was
contemptible
he
had
been
the
overseer
of
the
property
he
now
owned
and
had
spent
his
life
there
and
the
habit
of
command
had
developed
in
him
all
those
vices
which
invariably
spring
from
isolation
and
unlimited
power
suspicious
and
violent
unprincipled
and
unscrupulous
his
vanity
flattered
by
the
possession
of
the
handsomest
girl
in
the
colony
soon
effaced
in
him
any
sentiment
for
her
except
that
of
a
mean
jealousy
which
he
indulged
with
the
inflexibility
of
his
imperious
temper
elinor
shut
up
amongst
her
negresses
over
whom
she
had
no
control
many
of
them
being
indeed
her
own
rivals
had
now
to
endure
the
vilest
treatment
her
proud
and
sensitive
heart
was
filled
with
a
resentment
and
she
visited
on
all
men
the
hatred
and
contempt
which
were
merited
by
the
only
one
whom
she
had
opportunity
of
judging
her
parents
died
of
grief
at
having
thus
sacrificed
their
only
child
and
shortly
after
her
husband
worn
out
by
a
manner
of
life
whose
pleasures
he
had
thoroughly
exhausted
began
to
make
preparations
to
remove
to
france
he
had
already
arranged
for
the
purchase
of
an
estate
in
that
country
when
he
was
suddenly
overtaken
by
death
in
the
midst
of
a
debauch
thus
the
beautiful
elinor
de
roselis
found
herself
at
the
age
of
at
once
the
richest
and
most
independent
woman
in
the
colony
but
disgusted
with
a
place
in
which
she
had
known
only
sorrow
she
resolved
to
put
into
execution
her
husband
plans
and
settle
in
france
one
of
her
childhood
friends
mme
de
gernancé
who
had
been
more
fortunate
than
herself
in
marriage
was
also
about
to
remove
with
her
family
and
fortune
to
france
so
a
vessel
was
chartered
for
them
and
mme
de
roselis
having
once
more
vowed
on
the
tomb
of
her
parents
to
give
no
man
in
future
a
right
to
dispose
of
her
person
and
fate
went
on
board
her
mind
filled
with
a
thousand
schemes
and
nursing
as
many
fond
hopes
in
the
first
years
of
her
unhappy
married
life
mme
de
roselis
had
suffered
keenly
from
her
disappointment
in
having
no
children
later
she
found
consolation
in
the
fear
lest
a
child
of
hers
should
inherit
the
vices
that
caused
her
such
lasting
and
acute
pain
in
the
first
flush
of
her
recovered
liberty
this
regret
returned
with
fresh
force
alone
without
relatives
without
affection
on
the
eve
of
landing
on
a
foreign
shore
where
she
knew
no
one
she
realized
that
independence
is
not
the
only
requisite
for
happiness
and
that
we
all
need
some
interest
in
life
to
attach
us
to
it
the
company
of
her
friend
children
who
were
constantly
with
them
during
the
voyage
riveted
her
thoughts
to
the
subject
and
it
was
their
kisses
and
the
games
she
played
with
them
that
first
gave
her
the
idea
of
the
strange
scheme
we
have
seen
her
carry
out
the
long
journey
afforded
her
plenty
of
leisure
in
which
to
devise
a
way
to
guard
against
the
serious
inconveniences
that
might
arise
from
such
a
proceeding
and
in
proportion
as
the
idea
took
shape
in
her
mind
she
became
ever
more
enchanted
with
it
until
by
the
time
bordeaux
was
reached
she
was
completely
under
its
spell
making
only
a
short
stay
in
that
city
she
quickly
followed
and
mme
de
gernancé
to
paris
where
they
intended
to
spend
the
winter
together
we
have
seen
with
what
rashness
and
success
she
accomplished
her
object
and
how
her
lucky
star
threw
in
her
way
a
man
like
léon
de
préval
whose
honesty
and
steadiness
of
character
saved
her
from
the
dangers
to
which
she
was
bent
on
exposing
herself
admitting
only
her
faithful
black
servant
into
her
confidence
she
had
commissioned
him
to
find
for
her
in
some
distant
suburb
the
little
house
that
in
the
interval
between
the
two
balls
she
arranged
to
suit
her
purpose
the
secret
spring
that
extinguished
the
lamp
and
the
secret
door
by
which
she
escaped
were
the
fruit
of
the
careful
forethought
that
she
lavished
on
a
scheme
which
assuredly
could
be
justified
by
none
as
she
was
staying
in
the
same
hotel
as
her
traveling
companions
she
was
obliged
to
prepare
them
for
her
disappearance
by
telling
them
she
intended
to
leave
for
the
country
on
the
day
following
the
accordingly
on
the
day
appointed
notwithstanding
her
entreaties
she
duly
left
attended
by
the
negro
but
she
went
only
as
far
as
the
little
house
the
rest
of
her
household
having
started
a
few
hours
earlier
all
passed
off
as
she
had
planned
after
the
meeting
that
she
had
arranged
with
such
care
she
remained
concealed
a
short
time
in
the
villa
it
was
from
thence
she
had
written
to
him
the
letter
that
had
caused
léon
so
much
pain
a
few
days
later
she
left
for
touraine
her
first
care
on
arriving
was
to
spread
a
report
in
the
district
that
her
husband
already
ill
when
they
started
had
died
on
the
voyage
this
was
confirmed
by
her
mourning
dress
soon
she
allowed
it
to
be
known
that
she
was
hoping
shortly
to
possess
a
tardy
token
of
their
union
after
some
time
the
hope
became
an
obvious
certainty
and
toward
the
end
of
the
autumn
mme
de
roselis
obtained
her
heart
desire
and
gave
birth
to
a
daughter
who
was
brought
up
by
her
side
in
the
chateau
with
what
transports
of
joy
she
pressed
her
child
to
her
bosom
the
child
in
whom
all
the
happiness
of
her
life
was
bound
up
and
in
whom
all
her
tenderest
feelings
would
be
centered
you
will
love
me
dearly
she
said
you
will
thank
me
for
the
care
and
love
i
shall
lavish
on
you
i
shall
live
for
you
only
and
shall
never
have
to
fear
lest
desertion
and
insult
may
be
the
reward
of
my
devotion
at
last
i
have
at
my
side
a
creature
who
is
bound
to
me
by
the
sweetest
and
closest
of
ties
whose
innocent
affection
and
childish
joy
will
i
hope
suffice
for
my
own
happiness
it
was
but
natural
that
the
memory
of
him
to
whom
she
owed
her
new
happiness
should
be
present
with
her
in
the
first
glow
of
it
she
thought
how
delighted
léon
would
be
if
he
could
see
his
child
and
this
brought
back
to
her
mind
the
promise
she
had
made
to
let
him
know
the
date
of
its
birth
the
negro
was
sent
to
paris
to
order
the
ring
that
had
been
described
to
léon
he
was
told
to
find
out
at
the
war
office
the
whereabouts
of
his
regiment
and
to
start
immediately
at
full
speed
to
take
him
this
last
message
he
was
himself
to
place
it
in
the
hands
of
de
préval
and
to
depart
instantly
without
giving
the
young
officer
time
to
ask
a
single
question
the
black
carried
out
his
instructions
with
as
much
accuracy
as
intelligence
vi
one
morning
léon
who
had
hailed
with
some
excitement
the
opening
of
the
month
of
november
returned
from
drill
in
low
spirits
and
full
of
anxious
thought
he
was
about
to
go
at
once
to
his
quarters
when
he
heard
behind
him
the
trot
of
a
horse
and
turning
his
head
recognized
the
negro
he
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
and
delight
as
the
black
rode
up
to
him
and
without
dismounting
said
here
is
something
i
was
ordered
to
bring
to
you
and
at
the
same
moment
he
placed
in
his
hand
a
sealed
box
then
he
set
spurs
to
his
horse
and
was
out
of
sight
in
an
instant
léon
dumbfounded
followed
him
with
his
eyes
and
but
for
the
box
he
still
held
would
have
been
tempted
to
set
the
sudden
event
down
to
an
apparition
to
be
attributed
to
his
own
nervous
condition
hastily
he
opened
the
case
it
contained
only
the
half
of
a
gold
ring
split
like
a
french
wedding
ring
on
which
was
engraved
november
it
was
set
with
a
very
fine
emerald
so
it
is
a
girl
cried
léon
i
am
a
father
and
not
a
line
not
a
word
for
me
she
is
still
making
sport
of
me
this
ends
everything
probably
and
i
shall
never
hear
another
word
about
her
who
ever
can
she
be
this
creature
who
does
as
she
likes
with
me
and
seems
to
hold
my
future
in
her
hand
who
remains
invisible
and
yet
can
find
me
out
in
this
distant
spot
and
according
to
her
wayward
humor
seeks
me
or
forsakes
me
wretched
ball
fatal
meeting
he
turned
the
matter
over
in
his
disturbed
mind
in
a
hundred
different
ways
but
never
came
to
any
satisfactory
conclusion
a
long
year
passed
in
this
way
then
with
the
approach
of
the
following
spring
there
were
rumors
of
a
coming
war
a
spanish
expedition
was
talked
of
and
the
officers
looking
forward
to
promotion
and
glory
were
thankful
for
the
prospect
of
escape
from
inaction
léon
was
specially
impatient
for
the
signal
to
enter
the
fray
for
he
was
sick
of
living
with
his
memories
in
the
idleness
that
fostered
them
what
then
was
his
surprise
to
receive
one
day
a
despatch
from
the
war
office
informing
him
of
his
nomination
as
to
general
de
and
ordering
him
to
start
at
once
for
paris
where
he
was
to
join
that
officer
to
léon
who
had
never
seen
his
chief
and
knew
no
one
about
his
person
who
could
have
exerted
any
influence
in
his
behalf
this
promotion
was
inexplicable
for
some
time
past
however
he
had
been
living
in
an
atmosphere
of
extraordinary
events
this
last
filled
him
with
mingled
joy
and
hope
might
not
his
unknown
mistress
have
had
a
hand
in
the
matter
if
so
surely
here
was
a
clue
to
her
name
and
place
of
residence
at
all
events
he
was
going
back
to
paris
and
however
short
his
stay
in
the
capital
some
lucky
chance
might
help
him
in
his
search
thus
he
found
himself
once
more
back
in
the
city
where
he
was
received
in
the
kindest
way
by
his
general
who
installed
him
in
his
own
house
and
gave
him
a
place
at
his
table
at
first
the
multiplicity
of
his
duties
prevented
him
from
taking
any
of
those
steps
which
he
had
already
proved
to
be
more
than
useless
but
after
a
little
while
having
won
the
regard
of
his
chief
and
having
become
in
some
sort
a
favorite
with
him
he
ventured
to
ask
the
name
of
the
person
to
whom
he
owed
this
post
of
honor
the
general
informed
him
that
the
recommendation
of
de
who
was
in
charge
of
the
war
staff
and
the
record
of
léon
distinguished
conduct
in
the
last
campaign
had
led
him
to
ask
for
the
young
man
as
his
and
that
reminds
me
he
continued
you
ought
to
go
and
thank
him
i
shall
be
going
there
one
evening
soon
and
if
you
like
i
will
take
you
with
me
although
this
reply
was
a
disappointment
to
léon
he
gratefully
accepted
the
offer
and
a
few
days
later
the
general
took
him
in
his
own
carriage
to
call
upon
de
b
they
found
a
number
of
people
already
assembled
in
the
drawing
room
when
they
arrived
and
mme
de
had
just
arranged
some
card
tables
and
resumed
her
place
near
the
fire
where
she
was
chatting
with
a
small
circle
of
friends
consisting
of
some
three
or
four
women
and
as
many
men
when
léon
was
introduced
to
her
he
endeavored
to
obtain
from
her
the
information
he
was
so
eager
to
get
but
in
vain
after
some
civilities
the
conversation
again
became
general
and
mme
de
begged
one
of
the
gentlemen
to
continue
the
story
he
had
commenced
thus
léon
his
hopes
frustrated
found
himself
obliged
to
listen
with
the
rest
a
string
of
tales
some
amusing
others
strange
were
told
by
one
and
another
of
the
guests
and
then
mme
de
careful
that
each
in
turn
should
have
an
opportunity
to
shine
turned
toward
léon
and
asked
him
with
a
smile
whether
in
the
course
of
his
campaigns
and
the
vicissitudes
of
a
soldier
life
he
had
not
met
with
some
adventure
that
would
bear
relating
léon
mind
was
ever
engrossed
with
his
own
recent
experiences
and
he
at
once
told
the
tale
placing
it
however
to
the
account
of
a
brother
officer
but
imparting
to
it
the
living
interest
that
only
a
man
who
is
full
of
his
subject
can
command
when
he
had
finished
a
lively
discussion
of
this
singular
fad
of
independence
followed
the
ladies
judged
with
just
severity
the
inexcusable
imprudence
that
had
led
a
woman
so
lightly
to
expose
herself
and
they
blamed
her
for
having
sacrificed
her
principles
to
a
mistaken
taste
for
freedom
the
men
held
that
her
action
was
a
sign
of
character
and
imagination
and
that
she
had
lived
her
romance
with
as
much
wit
as
decision
and
they
set
her
down
as
a
charming
woman
they
all
wished
they
had
been
in
the
shoes
of
that
officer
but
all
declared
they
would
not
have
allowed
themselves
to
be
so
easily
shaken
off
for
no
vows
would
have
induced
them
to
refrain
from
unmasking
and
subjugating
the
beautiful
fugitive
indeed
said
a
lady
of
a
certain
age
with
some
dryness
one
need
hardly
have
been
so
scrupulous
with
a
person
who
had
so
little
respect
for
herself
i
admit
said
a
very
pretty
woman
seated
in
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
that
it
is
impossible
to
justify
her
conduct
still
one
may
suppose
that
her
aversion
for
a
second
marriage
rested
on
some
powerful
and
secret
motive
the
passion
of
maternity
seems
to
have
done
the
rest
and
which
of
us
when
fondling
the
child
who
smiles
up
at
us
but
can
find
in
our
heart
some
excuse
for
an
error
prompted
by
this
feeling
but
you
must
at
least
admit
that
it
was
very
hard
upon
this
poor
officer
why
what
harm
has
she
done
to
him
asked
the
pretty
lady
in
a
careless
tone
what
harm
cried
léon
with
some
heat
is
it
then
nothing
for
him
to
be
ever
pursued
by
the
memory
of
a
charming
woman
whom
he
loves
for
her
grace
and
spirit
the
possession
of
whom
caused
him
such
exquisite
pleasure
and
who
now
obstinately
conceals
herself
from
his
sight
and
his
affection
a
woman
who
apparently
only
aroused
his
passion
to
forsake
him
at
once
and
who
only
preserves
just
such
relations
with
him
as
may
keep
alive
a
desire
that
she
never
means
to
gratify
he
is
a
husband
and
a
father
and
yet
may
not
know
the
objects
of
the
most
natural
of
sentiments
he
does
not
even
know
their
whereabouts
though
he
is
followed
found
and
disposed
of
at
will
obligations
are
forced
on
him
while
he
less
fortunate
than
the
lowest
of
men
will
never
enjoy
the
reward
of
that
domestic
happiness
which
is
open
to
all
except
himself
oh
admit
there
is
some
exaggeration
in
all
this
what
is
to
prevent
him
from
marrying
but
how
can
he
madame
even
supposing
time
should
at
length
wear
out
the
deep
impression
made
on
him
by
his
transient
happiness
can
he
be
said
to
belong
to
himself
now
as
long
as
she
he
loves
is
free
can
he
cease
to
be
so
too
if
that
odd
aversion
for
a
natural
tie
should
pass
away
and
he
could
some
day
obtain
the
hand
he
has
so
long
desired
how
would
he
console
himself
if
in
the
meantime
he
had
disposed
of
his
own
you
certainly
attribute
to
your
friend
very
great
delicacy
of
feeling
said
the
lady
fixing
on
léon
a
glance
in
which
there
was
both
softness
and
interest
he
was
touched
and
went
on
with
increasing
fervor
and
then
this
ring
divided
between
his
child
and
him
is
not
that
too
a
chain
that
must
hold
him
forever
no
matter
in
what
position
he
may
be
placed
his
affection
and
fatherly
care
may
one
day
be
claimed
he
belongs
henceforth
to
some
one
though
no
one
belongs
to
him
and
as
a
finishing
touch
to
a
unique
situation
he
can
only
hope
to
find
his
child
by
losing
its
mother
the
first
sight
of
that
beloved
object
will
tell
him
that
one
dearer
yet
is
no
more
and
it
is
only
at
the
price
of
a
husband
happiness
that
he
can
hope
for
that
of
a
father
as
he
pronounced
the
last
words
léon
voice
broke
a
tear
gathered
in
his
eyes
my
word
my
dear
préval
said
the
general
smiling
you
have
given
us
so
pathetic
a
picture
of
the
young
man
situation
that
one
is
tempted
to
think
you
are
drawing
it
from
life
mme
de
seeing
léon
emotion
and
embarrassment
hastened
to
change
the
subject
he
remained
standing
against
the
chimney
piece
near
the
woman
there
was
a
moment
silence
you
have
roused
a
good
deal
of
interest
in
your
friend
she
said
gently
impossible
to
depict
his
feelings
with
greater
eloquence
at
least
madame
the
picture
is
a
true
one
but
the
campaign
now
about
to
begin
will
distract
his
mind
from
his
troubles
and
the
hope
of
putting
a
glorious
end
to
a
life
that
offers
no
prospect
of
happiness
what
are
you
thinking
of
monsieur
said
the
lovely
lady
if
you
have
any
influence
over
him
you
ought
to
use
it
to
turn
his
mind
from
so
terrible
an
idea
and
tell
him
it
is
his
duty
to
preserve
his
life
for
that
child
but
why
should
he
recognize
duties
that
can
bring
him
no
recompense
how
can
he
owe
his
life
to
those
who
have
spoiled
it
for
him
but
he
added
with
a
melancholy
smile
a
bullet
settles
very
many
questions
at
that
moment
the
general
called
to
him
and
they
took
their
leave
amid
cordial
wishes
from
their
friends
for
future
glory
and
a
safe
return
that
is
a
very
interesting
young
man
said
mme
de
when
the
general
and
his
had
left
he
has
a
charming
face
and
a
fine
mind
it
would
be
a
great
pity
if
he
perished
in
spain
vii
from
that
moment
mme
de
roselis
for
she
of
course
it
was
lost
the
tranquil
ease
and
proud
indifference
she
had
flattered
herself
she
would
be
able
to
preserve
she
now
measured
the
gravity
and
danger
of
her
act
by
the
severity
with
which
the
women
had
judged
it
while
the
light
comments
of
the
men
revealed
to
her
the
magnitude
of
the
debt
she
owed
to
léon
rare
delicacy
of
conduct
this
consideration
increased
her
regard
for
him
by
degrees
the
idea
that
she
had
injured
a
man
who
worshiped
her
and
whom
she
could
not
help
liking
the
peril
and
glory
that
hung
around
him
lending
him
the
glamour
that
women
love
and
finally
the
element
of
anxiety
about
him
the
food
on
which
both
love
and
memory
thrive
all
these
things
helped
to
waken
in
her
heart
a
feeling
that
was
new
to
her
she
was
seized
with
a
longing
to
see
her
daughter
again
and
regain
her
solitude
and
her
one
thought
was
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
while
paying
her
farewell
visit
to
mme
de
she
heard
that
general
and
his
pleasant
young
were
on
their
way
to
spain
where
hostilities
had
already
begun
her
heart
smote
her
she
cut
her
call
short
an
almost
painful
restlessness
impelled
her
homewards
to
hasten
the
preparations
for
departure
what
a
difference
there
was
between
her
present
state
of
mind
and
that
in
which
she
had
arrived
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter
when
on
mme
de
gernancé
pressing
invitation
she
had
agreed
to
spend
that
season
in
paris
cheerful
contented
in
the
flower
of
her
youth
looking
forward
to
every
kind
of
enjoyment
such
was
mme
de
roselis
then
and
it
may
be
imagined
with
what
favor
the
beautiful
and
wealthy
widow
was
received
in
a
society
where
happiness
constitutes
a
great
merit
mme
de
was
one
of
the
first
persons
to
whom
elinor
was
introduced
de
gernancé
was
an
intimate
friend
of
that
lady
husband
and
when
the
first
rumors
of
war
had
begun
to
circulate
in
the
city
the
idea
had
struck
elinor
to
utilize
this
friendship
to
procure
a
better
and
less
dangerous
post
for
léon
she
had
given
de
gernancé
to
understand
that
the
young
man
had
been
recommended
to
her
by
his
family
and
she
only
requested
that
her
name
might
not
be
mentioned
in
the
transaction
her
intervention
was
crowned
with
success
and
then
by
a
coincidence
the
meeting
between
the
two
had
taken
place
and
the
whole
course
of
her
life
was
suddenly
changed
mme
de
roselis
then
wended
her
way
back
to
touraine
worried
anxious
vexed
with
herself
for
the
folly
that
had
brought
about
such
unlooked
for
results
her
lively
imagination
painted
as
imminent
all
the
most
terrible
disasters
that
could
possibly
befall
and
her
heart
melted
at
the
contemplation
of
misfortunes
that
she
was
inventing
for
herself
she
left
her
black
servant
in
paris
to
collect
and
forward
all
the
news
that
came
in
from
spain
for
she
was
beginning
to
take
a
keen
interest
in
the
events
that
were
passing
there
at
the
sight
of
her
daughter
she
felt
her
dearer
to
her
than
ever
she
detected
a
likeness
hitherto
unnoticed
and
new
kisses
fonder
than
the
first
were
the
result
of
this
discovery
more
lonely
now
than
she
had
ever
been
mme
de
roselis
spent
the
summer
watching
the
daily
progress
of
her
darling
babe
every
month
it
grew
in
beauty
and
in
intelligence
elinor
was
charmed
yet
frequently
she
would
have
been
glad
to
find
at
her
side
some
one
who
could
share
her
maternal
enthusiasm
it
is
sad
after
all
she
said
to
herself
to
have
nobody
with
me
who
can
enter
into
my
happiness
and
share
it
with
me
i
suppose
she
went
on
with
a
sigh
that
her
pride
promptly
stifled
only
a
father
could
take
pleasure
in
these
childish
things
and
even
so
who
knows
but
afterwards
a
despotic
lord
and
master
might
hinder
my
plans
for
bringing
her
up
and
his
rigid
strictness
ah
but
léon
would
never
be
despotic
he
has
a
very
gentle
expression
and
a
tender
smile
he
would
make
a
good
father
then
she
remembered
that
he
was
far
away
and
exposed
to
all
the
dangers
of
war
that
he
sought
death
was
perhaps
already
dead
and
mme
de
roselis
wrote
for
tidings
from
spain
only
regaining
her
cheerful
and
proud
mien
when
she
learned
that
de
préval
was
in
such
or
such
a
town
and
in
good
health
as
winter
approached
her
friends
unable
to
conceive
what
was
the
attraction
that
kept
her
away
alone
wrote
urging
her
to
come
up
to
town
and
stay
with
them
again
but
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
as
yet
to
leave
her
little
léonie
again
for
she
loved
her
more
passionately
every
day
and
not
caring
to
inform
mme
de
gernancé
of
the
child
existence
she
made
various
excuses
for
postponing
her
departure
it
was
not
until
january
that
she
finally
went
up
to
paris
but
all
the
brilliant
gaiety
and
pleasant
parties
that
had
so
delighted
her
the
previous
year
now
failed
to
interest
her
at
all
they
seemed
tedious
and
insipid
she
returned
home
worn
out
and
discontented
felt
lonely
when
she
got
there
and
began
to
wonder
whether
the
independence
that
she
worshiped
was
not
too
frequently
purchased
at
the
price
of
an
empty
heart
and
the
dullness
it
involves
wearied
by
the
persistent
attentions
of
a
crowd
of
triflers
who
were
encouraged
by
her
position
she
told
herself
that
she
would
have
done
better
to
attach
to
her
side
one
who
would
have
rid
her
of
the
rest
that
in
society
an
attractive
and
beautiful
woman
needs
a
protector
who
will
compel
all
others
to
respect
her
and
imperceptibly
the
memory
of
léon
became
less
indifferent
to
her
then
suddenly
there
came
tidings
of
fierce
fighting
in
spain
in
great
alarm
elinor
filled
with
the
gloomiest
presentiments
hastened
to
call
on
mme
de
b
she
found
her
friends
already
occupied
with
the
subject
that
filled
her
thoughts
but
what
was
her
emotion
when
after
mentioning
the
names
of
several
officers
who
had
perished
in
the
engagement
mme
de
turning
to
her
said
do
you
remember
madame
that
nice
young
of
general
x
who
told
us
that
strange
story
well
he
has
disappeared
since
the
battle
he
is
not
to
be
found
among
either
the
living
or
the
dead
elinor
only
reply
was
a
cry
of
surprise
fortunately
for
her
all
those
present
broke
into
an
eager
discussion
of
the
news
she
listened
in
silence
to
conjectures
each
more
dismal
than
the
last
and
then
hastily
took
her
leave
she
knew
at
last
that
notwithstanding
all
her
precautions
a
man
had
the
power
to
disturb
her
happiness
and
influence
the
course
of
her
life
she
remained
in
paris
a
month
longer
hoping
always
to
obtain
reliable
information
but
as
no
news
came
to
throw
light
on
the
darkness
hanging
over
the
fate
of
léon
she
decided
to
return
to
touraine
in
vain
mme
de
gernancé
who
could
not
understand
her
low
spirits
tried
to
dissuade
her
from
leaving
them
fearing
in
her
uneasiness
about
her
friend
health
lest
loneliness
might
be
prejudicial
to
her
elinor
departed
carrying
with
her
the
anxiety
and
regret
that
she
could
not
shake
off
the
sight
of
her
child
only
increased
her
sorrow
she
has
only
me
now
she
said
he
who
might
one
day
have
taken
my
place
is
gone
she
watched
the
post
impatiently
but
nearly
two
months
passed
and
still
no
news
came
of
léon
fate
viii
she
sat
one
evening
in
a
corner
of
the
park
watching
the
child
at
play
and
musing
idly
on
the
man
whose
image
léonie
always
called
up
before
her
mind
presently
there
reached
her
ear
confused
voices
coming
from
the
servants
who
seemed
to
be
searching
for
her
madame
must
be
somewhere
in
the
park
with
her
daughter
she
heard
one
say
with
her
daughter
exclaimed
a
voice
that
she
recognized
as
mme
de
gernancé
at
the
same
moment
that
lady
came
in
sight
and
the
two
friends
fell
into
each
other
arms
dear
elinor
said
her
visitor
affectionately
my
anxiety
about
you
gave
me
no
peace
your
letters
have
been
so
few
and
far
between
and
were
so
sad
that
i
felt
i
must
come
and
see
for
myself
how
you
really
were
i
have
come
to
share
and
if
possible
enliven
your
solitude
for
a
little
time
but
while
her
friend
was
uttering
her
earnest
thanks
for
this
mark
of
friendship
mme
de
gernancé
had
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
child
in
much
surprise
and
curiosity
for
she
saw
that
she
was
treated
by
the
servants
as
the
daughter
of
the
house
and
in
her
baby
talk
she
constantly
called
out
to
her
mother
when
they
had
gone
back
to
the
house
mme
de
roselis
said
smiling
i
see
your
astonishment
and
i
can
guess
your
curiosity
yes
dear
friend
i
have
been
keeping
a
secret
from
you
a
secret
that
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
confide
in
you
but
now
tomorrow
you
shall
hear
all
about
it
and
my
story
will
at
the
same
time
explain
my
sadness
notwithstanding
the
fatigue
of
her
journey
mme
de
gernancé
scarcely
slept
that
night
so
great
was
her
anxiety
to
hear
the
explanation
of
what
was
a
mystery
to
her
she
was
up
early
in
the
morning
and
hastened
to
find
elinor
and
together
the
two
wandered
out
into
the
park
to
have
their
talk
alone
mme
de
roselis
walked
in
silence
by
her
friend
side
a
little
shy
of
making
this
confidence
that
she
had
promised
at
last
hesitating
slightly
she
thus
began
it
is
too
late
now
dear
friend
to
attempt
to
hide
from
you
a
secret
that
i
have
always
wanted
to
tell
you
and
which
i
only
delayed
because
i
knew
you
would
not
approve
however
since
i
must
confess
the
baby
who
has
so
excited
your
curiosity
is
my
daughter
i
had
so
longed
for
a
child
but
i
could
not
bear
to
place
my
neck
a
second
time
under
the
yoke
that
had
weighed
so
heavy
on
me
before
mme
de
gernancé
could
not
refrain
from
showing
the
surprise
she
felt
but
without
giving
her
time
to
speak
elinor
went
on
to
tell
her
about
the
rash
scheme
she
had
formed
on
the
voyage
and
the
means
she
had
adopted
for
carrying
it
out
she
came
at
last
to
the
birth
of
the
child
but
here
she
was
interrupted
impetuously
by
her
friend
what
precautions
and
prudence
to
bestow
on
an
act
of
sheer
madness
how
much
you
risked
how
could
you
compromise
in
such
a
way
your
reputation
and
indeed
your
very
life
and
why
all
these
sacrifices
just
to
grasp
an
imperfect
happiness
you
are
obliged
to
hide
and
dare
not
show
so
this
is
to
what
your
excessive
caution
has
brought
you
carried
away
by
your
imagination
you
have
hugged
a
chimera
which
led
you
to
refuse
the
real
blessings
of
life
in
favor
of
the
hollow
satisfaction
of
following
a
caprice
oh
take
my
advice
lose
no
time
in
recalling
the
father
of
that
dear
child
do
not
any
longer
deprive
yourself
of
the
pleasures
of
natural
affection
and
the
sweetest
of
home
ties
ah
it
is
no
longer
in
my
power
exclaimed
mme
de
roselis
listen
a
moment
and
you
shall
see
how
i
have
been
punished
for
the
error
you
so
severely
condemn
then
she
reminded
her
of
the
young
who
had
been
so
much
talked
about
at
mme
de
b
and
who
had
been
so
keenly
regretted
by
everybody
what
cried
mme
de
gernancé
was
it
he
oh
what
have
you
done
elinor
how
i
pity
you
now
you
see
how
your
folly
has
destroyed
your
peace
of
mind
and
happiness
and
by
a
punishment
that
you
richly
deserve
it
is
not
even
possible
for
you
to
make
any
amends
henceforth
you
will
be
a
wife
without
a
right
to
bear
the
name
and
a
mother
though
you
scarcely
dare
to
have
it
known
you
will
spend
your
life
blushing
for
the
most
natural
and
honorable
of
feelings
and
you
so
beautiful
so
brilliant
so
richly
gifted
by
nature
and
fortune
have
by
your
own
perverse
act
deprived
yourself
of
the
happiness
the
meanest
of
women
is
entitled
to
enjoy
the
happiness
of
having
husband
and
child
the
sweetest
of
all
but
there
is
more
in
it
even
than
that
i
can
read
your
heart
it
is
useless
for
your
pride
to
try
to
conceal
the
fact
from
your
friend
and
from
yourself
your
heart
is
no
longer
in
your
own
keeping
you
love
you
have
given
it
at
this
mme
de
roselis
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
the
tears
flowed
from
her
eyes
dear
elinor
said
mme
de
gernancé
kindly
drawing
nearer
to
her
and
taking
her
in
her
arms
when
i
see
you
weep
i
realize
i
love
you
too
well
to
be
your
judge
do
grieve
any
more
for
an
evil
that
may
be
remedied
let
us
hope
that
léon
is
still
alive
and
that
all
may
yet
be
condoned
but
at
that
word
elinor
tears
ceased
condoned
she
said
proudly
no
my
dear
i
do
not
think
i
should
easily
consent
to
what
you
call
condoning
it
i
have
done
wrong
it
is
true
but
not
from
weakness
i
did
it
on
purpose
after
long
consideration
of
the
troubles
i
had
borne
it
is
true
i
grieve
over
the
fate
of
a
man
who
does
interest
me
and
whose
life
i
have
disturbed
and
perhaps
shortened
i
can
not
be
happy
again
until
i
know
he
is
not
dead
but
as
for
giving
up
my
independence
and
by
this
change
of
mind
letting
people
think
i
had
been
either
weak
or
inconsequent
this
i
shall
never
consent
to
mme
de
gernancé
saw
that
it
was
not
the
moment
to
attack
either
the
prejudices
or
the
pride
of
her
friend
from
that
moment
however
léon
became
their
one
subject
of
conversation
and
by
thus
constantly
talking
about
him
elinor
unconsciously
strengthened
the
inclination
she
already
felt
for
him
for
her
part
mme
de
gernancé
would
draw
an
attractive
picture
of
the
happiness
she
herself
enjoyed
and
which
she
assured
her
friend
might
easily
be
hers
as
well
elinor
now
touched
and
somewhat
shaken
in
her
resolution
would
smile
at
her
friend
advice
and
anon
returning
to
her
cherished
chimera
of
liberty
would
wax
indignant
at
the
suggestion
that
she
should
give
it
up
after
the
sacrifices
she
had
made
in
its
name
still
on
one
point
the
two
friends
were
ever
agreed
and
that
was
in
wishing
that
léon
might
return
elinor
and
mme
de
gernancé
were
one
day
together
discussing
their
favorite
subject
when
a
messenger
came
to
tell
them
that
the
servant
of
a
traveler
who
was
passing
along
the
high
road
was
imploring
help
for
his
master
who
ill
and
in
great
pain
had
just
fainted
away
in
his
carriage
mme
de
roselis
at
once
gave
orders
that
everything
possible
should
be
done
for
him
and
urged
by
compassion
so
natural
to
women
went
herself
accompanied
by
her
friend
to
see
the
sick
man
he
had
been
lifted
out
of
the
carriage
and
was
lying
on
the
grass
pale
unconscious
and
covered
with
blood
his
frightened
servant
was
declaring
that
the
wound
had
opened
and
his
master
was
lost
it
was
at
this
moment
that
mme
de
roselis
arrived
on
the
scene
but
scarcely
had
her
eyes
fallen
on
the
inanimate
form
before
her
when
she
screamed
and
hiding
her
face
on
her
friend
shoulder
she
said
in
a
stifled
voice
it
is
he
he
is
going
to
die
before
my
very
eyes
in
heaven
name
replied
mme
de
gernancé
in
a
whisper
take
courage
do
betray
yourself
those
few
words
were
enough
to
bring
elinor
to
her
senses
feeling
the
danger
of
the
situation
she
summoned
all
her
strength
and
ordered
the
interesting
invalid
to
be
carried
still
fainting
into
the
chateau
ix
when
he
once
more
opened
his
eyes
léon
found
himself
in
bed
with
a
surgeon
seated
beside
him
his
wound
had
been
redressed
and
everything
done
for
him
that
kindness
could
suggest
his
servant
whom
he
tried
to
question
was
eager
to
tell
him
in
a
few
words
what
had
happened
but
the
surgeon
interrupted
him
and
ordered
silence
and
rest
to
mme
de
roselis
who
was
anxiously
awaiting
news
of
the
sick
man
it
was
a
shock
to
learn
that
he
was
extremely
weak
from
loss
of
blood
and
that
in
the
event
of
fever
setting
in
he
could
hardly
be
expected
to
resist
it
perfect
quiet
was
ordered
it
was
decided
that
the
ladies
must
not
go
into
his
room
but
should
content
themselves
with
seeing
that
he
had
everything
he
needed
next
morning
elinor
rang
her
bell
before
dawn
and
was
terrified
to
learn
that
fever
had
set
in
during
the
night
to
be
followed
by
delirium
it
was
only
then
in
the
surprise
she
felt
at
her
own
despair
that
she
realized
how
dear
léon
had
become
to
her
and
she
now
admitted
to
herself
that
she
could
never
be
happy
without
him
of
her
pride
and
futile
prejudices
nothing
remained
her
whole
being
was
engrossed
by
the
thought
of
his
danger
mme
de
gernancé
was
so
afraid
her
agitation
would
betray
her
that
she
took
great
trouble
throughout
the
day
to
keep
her
out
of
the
patient
room
but
the
next
night
when
her
household
was
in
bed
and
she
was
once
more
alone
and
sleepless
in
the
solemn
silence
which
intensifies
suffering
and
renders
fear
unbearable
elinor
unable
any
longer
to
wrestle
with
her
anxiety
rose
and
slipped
out
into
the
corridor
to
listen
at
the
door
of
léon
room
and
find
out
how
he
was
he
was
still
evidently
delirious
and
the
distressed
accents
of
his
trembling
voice
came
brokenly
to
her
ear
forgetting
everything
but
her
grief
she
opened
the
door
softly
and
went
in
the
nurse
had
fallen
asleep
by
the
dim
light
of
the
lamp
she
recognized
the
pleasant
features
that
were
so
deeply
graven
on
her
memory
but
the
eyes
were
now
fixed
the
face
bright
with
fever
his
labored
breathing
could
scarcely
lift
the
sheet
that
seemed
to
weigh
all
too
heavily
on
his
chest
elinor
dropped
into
an
that
was
close
to
the
door
and
hid
her
face
and
her
tears
in
her
two
hands
the
slight
noise
she
made
roused
léon
from
his
momentary
stupor
is
that
she
he
said
will
she
come
i
am
going
to
die
let
me
see
her
at
last
tell
her
i
am
dying
but
where
is
she
to
be
found
i
have
lost
her
lost
her
forever
he
paused
and
then
began
again
my
daughter
bring
her
to
me
can
they
refuse
to
let
me
see
my
child
when
i
am
dying
poor
little
thing
do
try
to
find
your
father
you
have
none
he
was
not
able
even
to
give
you
his
blessing
in
his
last
moments
this
was
too
much
for
elinor
and
she
burst
out
sobbing
léon
started
and
turned
his
head
slightly
but
his
eyes
still
fixed
saw
nothing
where
is
this
mysterious
hiding
place
what
do
i
see
on
the
sofa
it
is
you
you
whom
i
adore
you
whom
i
sought
i
hold
you
in
my
arms
but
your
mask
take
off
your
mask
do
take
it
off
what
you
still
want
to
run
away
no
no
you
shall
not
escape
me
again
as
he
spoke
he
made
an
effort
to
raise
himself
léon
cried
elinor
rushing
to
the
bedside
léon
stop
he
looked
up
at
her
startled
uncertain
then
after
an
silence
he
began
again
more
calmly
it
is
too
much
lift
my
head
ah
if
i
could
but
sleep
by
this
time
the
nurse
roused
by
elinor
cry
had
come
forward
to
support
him
but
he
turned
from
her
and
let
his
head
drop
on
bosom
by
degrees
a
more
tranquil
sleep
seemed
to
steal
over
his
senses
a
little
later
mme
de
gernancé
joined
them
looking
anxiously
for
her
friend
she
too
had
risen
before
daybreak
and
not
finding
elinor
in
her
own
apartments
had
hastened
to
the
sick
room
where
the
spectacle
before
her
eyes
arrested
her
at
the
door
léon
was
asleep
supported
on
elinor
shoulder
while
she
seated
motionless
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
with
her
head
bent
over
her
lover
was
vainly
endeavoring
to
check
the
tears
that
streamed
from
her
eyes
mme
de
gernancé
hastened
up
to
the
bed
what
are
you
doing
here
elinor
she
said
in
a
low
whisper
how
imprudent
you
are
leave
me
alone
her
friend
rejoined
nothing
will
induce
me
to
leave
this
bed
until
this
unfortunate
man
is
either
dead
or
saved
i
do
care
who
knows
that
i
love
him
and
that
i
am
his
it
is
a
just
punishment
for
my
offenses
if
only
he
might
live
nothing
else
matters
fear
of
disturbing
the
patient
kept
them
both
silent
after
that
and
léon
sleep
continued
as
calm
as
it
was
sound
he
had
slept
several
hours
when
half
opening
his
eyes
and
making
an
effort
to
lift
the
heavy
lids
his
first
glance
fell
on
the
trembling
elinor
who
was
trying
gently
to
put
him
back
on
the
pillows
he
closed
his
eyes
again
then
once
more
opening
them
where
am
i
he
said
in
a
weak
voice
then
seeing
that
he
was
almost
in
the
arms
of
a
woman
who
did
not
look
like
a
nurse
he
made
a
movement
to
try
to
help
her
to
set
down
her
burden
his
eyes
wild
no
longer
but
filled
with
surprise
and
doubt
followed
elinor
behind
the
curtain
where
she
was
attempting
to
conceal
herself
is
it
a
dream
he
said
speaking
with
difficulty
i
seem
to
have
seen
that
face
before
ah
madame
am
i
to
believe
he
has
recognized
me
she
said
to
herself
in
a
fright
and
blushing
crimson
once
i
think
at
mme
de
b
house
but
once
is
sufficient
one
could
never
forget
you
and
his
large
languid
eyes
were
still
riveted
on
her
be
quiet
be
quiet
no
more
talking
you
are
ordered
the
strictest
silence
keep
still
and
do
not
even
think
hope
and
sleep
the
doctor
arrived
shortly
he
declared
that
the
long
sleep
had
done
the
patient
a
world
of
good
that
the
fever
had
gone
down
and
if
the
temperature
now
remained
steady
through
the
coming
night
he
might
be
considered
to
be
saved
elinor
listened
holding
her
breath
and
drinking
in
the
reassuring
words
her
joy
too
great
to
be
repressed
brought
back
a
charming
color
to
her
pale
wet
cheeks
when
night
fell
she
insisted
on
taking
her
place
in
a
corner
of
room
to
await
the
dreaded
attack
of
fever
it
did
not
come
however
and
the
night
proved
a
good
one
the
following
day
the
doctor
announced
that
there
was
no
longer
any
danger
but
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
warm
mme
de
roselis
that
convalescence
would
probably
be
slow
and
that
it
would
be
dangerous
to
move
the
patient
until
the
wound
was
thoroughly
healed
elinor
making
a
great
effort
to
show
only
a
cool
compassion
trembled
with
joy
at
the
prospect
of
the
long
days
to
come
when
in
sweet
intimacy
she
would
be
able
to
devote
herself
to
léon
and
restore
him
to
happiness
as
she
had
already
restored
him
to
life
it
was
not
long
before
he
was
able
to
express
his
gratitude
to
the
kind
chatelaine
whom
as
he
believed
he
had
seen
but
once
before
but
whose
beauty
indulgence
and
sensitiveness
had
made
the
deepest
impression
on
him
the
two
friends
hardly
left
his
room
they
amused
him
read
to
him
played
soft
music
to
him
it
was
the
story
over
again
of
bayard
nursed
by
the
two
sisters
nay
it
was
more
elinor
ever
watchful
seemed
to
guess
and
forestall
his
every
want
she
always
knew
how
to
find
for
him
the
easiest
position
and
she
surrounded
him
with
those
thousand
and
one
little
attentions
which
add
to
your
comfort
without
attracting
your
attention
it
was
then
that
léon
told
them
how
wounded
severely
in
a
hot
fight
in
spain
and
left
on
the
field
of
battle
he
had
been
dragged
from
the
jaws
of
death
by
a
woman
who
touched
by
his
youth
and
condition
had
taken
him
home
with
her
and
nursed
him
tenderly
he
was
recovering
when
a
troop
of
guerillas
arrived
at
the
place
and
he
was
forced
to
flee
from
his
benefactress
house
in
order
to
escape
from
their
hands
after
many
narrow
escapes
he
had
finally
reached
bayonne
where
he
had
been
too
restless
to
stay
long
enough
to
be
entirely
cured
and
the
fatigues
of
the
journey
had
brought
about
the
accident
to
which
he
owed
her
generous
hospitality
this
was
his
story
and
it
explained
to
elinor
the
uncertainty
that
had
for
so
long
hung
about
his
fate
x
meantime
poor
little
léonie
was
the
only
person
who
had
a
right
to
feel
aggrieved
by
the
arrival
of
the
new
guest
for
she
was
carefully
excluded
from
his
room
where
her
high
spirits
might
have
appeared
too
boisterous
elinor
had
a
feeling
of
shame
about
showing
her
to
léon
as
if
she
feared
that
he
might
guess
his
own
interest
in
her
but
the
child
having
been
accustomed
to
be
always
with
her
mother
was
constantly
running
after
her
finding
the
sick
man
door
ajar
one
day
she
softly
pushed
it
and
put
her
pretty
head
through
to
look
in
her
eyes
both
timid
and
inquisitive
fell
on
the
stranger
whom
she
had
never
yet
seen
léon
was
the
first
to
catch
sight
of
her
he
called
out
in
surprise
where
does
that
beautiful
baby
come
from
he
exclaimed
she
had
already
fled
but
her
mother
with
beating
heart
and
flushed
cheeks
called
her
back
took
her
in
her
arms
and
placed
her
on
knees
he
was
conscious
of
a
sudden
rush
of
memory
and
in
an
inexplicable
tide
of
feeling
he
gazed
fondly
at
her
covered
her
with
caresses
and
then
inquired
her
age
in
a
voice
that
betrayed
great
emotion
elinor
confused
and
now
convinced
that
he
had
guessed
the
truth
added
a
year
i
should
have
taken
her
to
be
younger
said
léon
with
a
sign
and
fell
into
a
muse
the
little
girl
having
forgotten
her
fears
now
refused
to
leave
the
lap
of
her
new
friend
nor
could
he
bear
to
set
her
down
but
i
must
part
you
said
elinor
smiling
when
i
see
you
so
distressed
i
regret
having
brought
her
in
ah
madame
if
you
knew
of
what
she
reminds
me
but
if
i
may
take
you
to
be
the
hero
of
an
interesting
anecdote
that
i
have
by
no
means
forgotten
i
can
easily
guess
well
yes
madame
it
was
i
and
though
she
has
betrayed
and
cast
me
off
after
apparently
choosing
me
i
have
remained
in
spite
of
myself
faithful
to
her
memory
ever
regretting
a
shadow
and
pursuing
a
vain
chimera
unable
to
die
or
to
live
happy
any
longer
elinor
could
hardly
keep
back
her
tears
then
she
said
timidly
you
love
her
still
i
scarcely
know
if
i
do
if
i
am
weak
enough
to
love
her
still
but
our
meetings
the
moments
spent
in
her
presence
her
grace
even
her
capriciousness
all
are
graven
on
my
memory
she
has
bruised
my
soul
and
taken
the
glamour
from
life
for
me
oh
cried
elinor
in
a
heartbroken
voice
such
constancy
deserves
reward
you
may
be
sure
that
the
day
will
come
when
she
will
return
humbled
in
her
turn
softened
to
heal
the
wounds
she
has
caused
and
to
win
your
pardon
never
for
three
years
that
proud
unfeeling
woman
has
never
condescended
to
send
me
as
much
as
a
word
of
remembrance
she
has
probably
gone
back
to
her
own
land
to
india
america
or
where
not
she
has
triumphed
and
must
be
laughing
at
my
credulity
and
i
should
like
to
forget
her
lately
i
have
almost
thought
it
might
be
possible
and
perhaps
indeed
he
added
in
an
altered
voice
i
shall
succeed
only
too
soon
you
will
forget
her
léon
the
words
had
been
spoken
in
a
voice
of
such
tender
reproach
that
léon
gazed
at
her
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
ah
madame
he
said
after
a
moment
pause
your
sympathy
is
very
dear
to
me
if
only
she
had
your
nature
your
responsive
sensitiveness
i
should
be
a
happy
man
today
my
own
child
perhaps
as
pretty
as
yours
would
be
now
sitting
on
my
knee
then
turning
on
elinor
his
still
languid
eyes
and
her
mother
close
beside
me
loving
these
recollections
only
sadden
you
and
do
you
no
good
at
all
said
elinor
shaking
all
over
and
picking
up
her
child
decidedly
i
shall
have
to
part
you
forgive
me
madame
i
have
been
dreaming
but
why
wake
me
so
soon
not
daring
to
listen
to
another
word
elinor
fled
with
her
child
to
tell
mme
de
gernancé
all
that
had
passed
between
them
from
that
day
little
léonie
was
as
assiduous
as
her
mother
in
her
attentions
to
the
convalescent
he
continually
asked
for
her
and
became
passionately
attached
to
her
the
child
for
her
part
called
him
her
friend
heaped
kisses
on
him
and
insisted
on
being
always
between
him
and
her
mother
her
artless
affection
for
them
both
gave
rise
to
many
an
embarrassing
scene
that
was
fraught
with
pleasure
for
elinor
but
left
léon
ever
more
depressed
and
pensive
meantime
he
was
growing
visibly
stronger
his
wound
was
making
progress
time
which
passes
so
swiftly
in
the
happy
days
of
a
budding
friendship
had
brought
winter
back
again
with
the
month
of
december
mme
de
gernancé
had
for
some
time
talked
of
leaving
them
she
now
declared
she
could
no
longer
postpone
her
departure
then
all
at
once
in
a
voice
that
showed
the
effort
the
words
cost
him
léon
begged
permission
to
accompany
her
greatly
surprised
at
so
sudden
a
decision
mme
de
roselis
opposed
the
plan
ah
madame
he
answered
quickly
pray
let
me
go
i
have
but
too
long
reveled
in
a
happiness
that
is
full
of
danger
since
it
is
not
for
me
let
me
flee
from
you
and
your
child
from
the
spell
of
your
kind
care
and
these
happy
days
that
fly
so
fast
let
me
return
to
the
solitude
that
must
ever
be
my
lot
but
at
least
wait
till
we
can
ask
the
doctor
if
you
are
fit
to
there
are
dangers
from
which
the
doctor
with
his
science
is
powerless
to
preserve
me
my
destiny
is
to
flee
all
that
is
lovable
all
that
might
captivate
and
charm
i
can
not
get
away
from
this
place
too
soon
well
my
dear
said
elinor
turning
to
her
friend
i
must
then
trust
my
wounded
knight
to
your
care
you
will
answer
to
me
for
his
safety
at
all
events
a
little
taken
aback
perhaps
at
her
letting
him
go
so
easily
léon
went
out
to
give
the
necessary
orders
for
his
departure
elinor
followed
him
with
her
eyes
a
smile
on
her
face
well
perhaps
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
explain
this
new
comedy
to
me
said
mme
de
gernancé
in
much
vexation
it
is
clear
that
he
is
running
away
because
he
is
afraid
he
might
love
you
then
what
are
you
waiting
for
why
not
reveal
yourself
and
end
this
folly
that
has
lasted
already
far
too
long
can
you
find
any
pleasure
in
this
new
way
of
tormenting
him
ah
dear
how
fascinating
it
is
to
be
your
own
rival
to
win
him
twice
under
such
different
guises
he
is
true
to
me
even
in
his
inconstancy
he
has
so
much
delicacy
and
honor
that
he
runs
from
me
so
as
not
to
betray
me
he
loved
me
once
he
loves
no
one
but
me
how
happy
i
am
but
léon
poor
léon
when
are
you
going
to
begin
to
think
about
his
happiness
say
what
you
have
to
say
to
him
elinor
and
let
us
all
go
to
paris
together
where
you
can
make
a
marriage
that
will
i
suppose
have
no
terrors
for
you
no
i
have
a
plan
in
my
head
you
go
with
him
and
i
will
follow
you
very
shortly
elinor
elinor
still
romantic
still
imagining
wild
schemes
dear
friend
only
this
once
it
shall
be
the
very
last
time
i
swear
at
that
moment
léon
returned
he
seemed
disturbed
and
excited
everything
was
being
got
ready
for
his
journey
mme
de
gernancé
displeased
with
her
friend
but
forced
to
yield
to
her
went
off
to
make
her
own
preparations
but
when
the
time
came
to
say
every
one
broke
down
elinor
in
tears
handed
her
patient
over
to
mme
de
gernancé
who
promised
to
take
him
home
with
her
and
to
look
after
him
carefully
léon
white
and
grave
stood
beside
the
carriage
thanking
her
over
and
over
again
in
impassioned
tones
he
constantly
left
and
then
returned
to
the
child
who
cried
aloud
when
she
saw
her
friend
going
away
mme
de
gernancé
came
close
to
elinor
there
is
still
time
she
said
in
a
whisper
wavering
for
a
moment
mme
de
roselis
at
last
replied
no
there
is
only
one
way
in
which
i
can
make
that
difficult
confession
then
mme
de
gernancé
drew
léon
away
took
her
seat
in
the
carriage
with
him
and
the
horses
started
at
once
bearing
both
out
of
sight
xi
alone
again
elinor
found
her
solitude
unbearable
the
happiness
she
had
lately
tasted
could
henceforth
alone
satisfy
her
heart
her
one
thought
now
was
to
hasten
to
rejoin
her
friend
and
the
man
whom
she
already
regarded
as
her
husband
a
week
after
their
departure
found
her
with
her
little
daughter
back
in
her
town
house
mme
de
gernancé
was
the
only
person
who
had
been
informed
of
her
arrival
after
a
long
talk
in
which
she
explained
to
her
friend
the
way
a
trifle
romantic
withal
in
which
she
intended
to
make
herself
known
to
léon
she
succeeded
in
inducing
her
friend
to
help
her
carry
out
the
scheme
that
pleased
her
fancy
and
the
pair
separated
having
arranged
all
the
details
agreed
upon
the
season
of
the
opera
balls
had
opened
and
mme
de
gernancé
invited
léon
one
night
to
accompany
her
to
one
he
declined
at
first
with
a
hot
haste
she
had
not
anticipated
the
scene
of
the
adventure
that
was
to
have
such
an
influence
upon
his
life
had
become
hateful
to
him
and
he
had
sworn
never
to
set
foot
there
again
but
mme
de
gernancé
insisted
she
asked
him
only
to
lend
her
his
arm
until
she
could
find
a
stranger
who
had
promised
to
come
and
whom
she
wanted
to
puzzle
léon
unable
to
refuse
anything
to
mme
de
roselis
friend
at
last
consented
though
with
inward
repugnance
and
they
set
off
together
his
entrance
into
the
ballroom
was
a
painful
moment
for
him
a
tumult
of
memories
surged
up
in
his
mind
mme
de
gernancé
made
a
few
turns
round
the
hall
with
him
and
then
pretending
to
have
discovered
the
person
she
was
seeking
she
set
him
at
liberty
and
said
scarcely
had
she
left
his
arm
when
a
voice
in
spite
of
the
slight
affectation
of
manner
inseparable
from
a
masked
ball
made
his
every
pulse
leap
uttered
close
beside
him
the
words
ah
ha
i
have
caught
you
faithless
one
it
is
not
for
me
you
are
looking
this
time
at
the
opera
ball
he
turned
and
saw
before
him
who
was
it
his
unknown
lady
herself
the
white
domino
the
mask
even
the
diamond
buckle
that
fastened
her
belt
which
he
had
noticed
on
that
other
occasion
all
were
there
it
is
she
he
exclaimed
seizing
her
arm
and
slipping
it
beneath
his
own
have
i
found
you
again
is
it
you
i
am
looking
at
is
it
you
i
hold
by
what
inconceivable
miracle
is
it
really
so
astonishing
you
know
my
talent
for
miracles
it
is
true
it
is
the
only
thing
i
do
know
about
you
but
what
is
past
is
nothing
there
is
much
more
to
come
now
that
you
have
fallen
again
in
my
power
you
may
expect
the
most
extraordinary
consequences
your
fate
is
sealed
your
destiny
is
about
to
be
fulfilled
but
while
she
talked
a
growing
disappointment
damped
the
sudden
joy
that
léon
had
experienced
at
the
first
sight
of
her
he
was
bitterly
wounded
by
the
light
imperious
tone
she
had
adopted
after
those
three
years
of
total
forgetfulness
added
to
her
other
wrongs
all
the
hard
thoughts
he
had
harbored
of
her
in
the
long
interval
crowded
back
now
upon
his
mind
he
stopped
short
well
madame
he
said
coldly
what
is
it
you
want
of
me
what
fresh
scheme
are
you
devising
what
new
way
of
taking
me
in
oh
what
a
change
three
years
can
work
in
a
man
is
this
the
tender
gentle
attentive
léon
who
in
this
very
room
so
fervently
vowed
to
be
wholly
constant
and
submissive
ah
if
i
am
changed
whose
is
the
fault
cruel
one
is
it
not
your
own
for
you
devoted
to
my
undoing
all
the
charm
that
has
most
power
over
the
heart
of
man
and
having
betrayed
my
faith
you
cast
me
off
without
remorse
as
without
pity
did
you
not
take
a
pleasure
in
teaching
me
the
value
of
what
you
cheated
me
out
of
and
then
leave
me
for
three
years
to
my
regrets
to
forget
you
as
best
i
could
léon
you
are
too
severe
here
i
am
with
you
again
i
have
come
back
to
atone
for
the
wrong
i
did
you
and
restore
to
you
all
you
pined
for
ah
how
can
i
put
any
faith
in
your
words
now
perhaps
in
a
minute
or
two
you
will
once
more
disappear
from
my
view
leaving
no
trace
behind
you
but
the
pain
you
cause
me
you
are
possibly
already
contriving
some
fresh
ruse
here
she
interrupted
him
saying
in
a
softened
voice
no
no
more
ruses
no
more
secrets
ah
léon
i
too
have
suffered
but
let
us
forget
the
folly
and
pain
that
are
over
now
you
may
know
and
claim
your
wife
now
you
did
not
want
to
be
my
wife
true
but
i
was
wrong
now
i
have
come
back
to
surrender
to
your
love
once
you
disdained
it
a
pure
and
lasting
love
that
filled
my
heart
for
you
what
new
caprice
prompts
you
now
to
claim
it
are
you
sure
it
still
exists
for
you
was
i
to
foster
an
insane
passion
for
an
invisible
woman
who
had
forsaken
me
what
makes
you
suppose
me
unchanged
why
should
i
not
in
my
turn
reject
a
chain
once
hateful
to
yourself
why
should
not
i
too
now
cherish
my
independence
to
me
its
cost
is
less
than
it
is
to
you
these
terrible
words
smote
elinor
to
the
core
all
the
gaiety
and
fond
hope
that
she
had
brought
with
her
to
the
ball
were
gone
now
she
admitted
the
justice
of
the
unexpected
reproaches
with
which
he
had
met
her
advances
and
in
her
humiliation
her
courage
and
her
strength
both
deserted
her
léon
saw
that
she
could
scarcely
stand
and
he
led
her
to
a
bench
away
from
the
crowd
seating
himself
beside
her
fortunately
the
pain
she
was
enduring
found
relief
in
tears
ah
forgive
me
said
léon
touched
at
the
spectacle
of
her
genuine
grief
forgive
me
o
you
whom
i
can
not
understand
i
am
angry
now
with
myself
for
my
misplaced
harshness
only
having
received
so
many
marks
of
your
indifference
could
i
expect
to
find
you
vulnerable
then
he
pressed
her
to
drop
her
mask
and
allow
him
to
see
her
home
at
first
she
was
tempted
to
comply
and
to
reveal
the
face
that
would
instantly
have
disarmed
him
but
she
dreaded
a
scene
that
might
attract
all
eyes
to
them
and
a
wish
to
put
him
to
one
more
proof
restrained
her
drawing
her
hood
down
over
her
eyes
and
disguising
her
voice
more
carefully
than
ever
she
said
sadly
no
why
take
me
home
the
hour
is
late
and
you
have
taught
me
circumspection
why
remove
my
mask
of
what
use
to
know
a
woman
you
can
no
longer
love
i
can
see
why
you
are
so
cold
i
know
where
you
spent
your
convalescence
and
whose
hands
nursed
you
well
then
madame
said
léon
seriously
you
know
also
that
my
gratitude
could
not
possibly
be
too
warm
or
my
admiration
too
high
yes
i
do
not
deny
it
in
three
months
of
the
most
endearing
intimacy
tended
by
a
woman
whose
beauty
was
the
least
of
her
charms
a
woman
sympathetic
and
reasonable
who
unites
the
dignity
proper
to
her
sex
with
that
kindness
of
heart
that
is
an
ornament
the
more
could
i
fail
to
appreciate
so
many
lovable
qualities
could
i
ever
forget
her
elinor
beside
herself
with
joy
at
his
words
felt
that
if
she
stayed
another
moment
she
would
betray
herself
in
spite
of
her
efforts
she
rose
at
once
be
happy
then
she
said
your
happiness
will
be
mine
i
say
no
more
about
myself
i
ask
nothing
you
are
free
but
would
you
care
to
see
your
daughter
would
i
indeed
you
can
not
doubt
it
then
come
and
lunch
with
me
tomorrow
and
you
shall
she
gave
him
her
address
but
without
adding
her
name
my
people
will
know
she
said
they
will
show
you
in
she
left
deeply
affected
by
what
had
passed
what
would
have
become
of
me
she
said
to
herself
in
terror
what
should
i
have
done
if
i
had
never
had
the
opportunity
of
winning
his
esteem
and
his
love
in
another
aspect
xii
that
night
was
spent
by
léon
in
the
greatest
agitation
at
last
then
he
had
found
the
object
of
such
keen
desire
and
such
lasting
regret
soon
he
was
to
know
her
he
was
to
see
his
daughter
his
daughter
whose
image
he
had
so
vainly
tried
to
conjure
up
no
doubt
it
was
now
open
to
him
to
take
up
the
position
of
husband
and
father
the
title
for
which
he
had
longed
was
now
probably
within
his
reach
and
yet
the
remembrance
of
mme
de
roselis
would
place
itself
in
the
midst
of
the
picture
and
the
comparison
was
not
to
the
advantage
of
the
unknown
lady
indeed
could
any
woman
match
elinor
in
his
eyes
on
the
following
day
punctual
to
the
appointment
he
arrived
at
the
hour
named
and
the
first
person
who
met
his
eyes
was
the
negro
who
was
so
closely
associated
with
his
recollections
the
black
conducted
him
through
several
richly
furnished
apartments
to
a
door
which
he
threw
open
announcing
de
préval
léon
went
forward
and
found
himself
in
a
boudoir
that
instantly
recalled
to
his
mind
one
that
three
long
years
had
not
effaced
from
his
memory
the
illusion
was
completed
by
the
sight
of
a
woman
in
the
same
attitude
as
before
wearing
the
same
dress
and
seated
on
a
sofa
a
child
was
sitting
on
her
lap
as
léon
approached
she
turned
around
what
do
i
see
he
cried
elinor
is
such
happiness
possible
ah
if
this
be
some
cruel
game
stop
i
beg
you
or
i
die
before
your
eyes
at
the
same
moment
the
little
léonie
ran
to
throw
herself
in
his
arms
and
showing
him
a
half
ring
that
was
hanging
round
her
neck
she
said
in
her
sweet
childish
way
friend
léon
will
you
mend
my
ring
for
me
he
glanced
at
it
made
an
exclamation
and
then
overcome
with
surprise
and
happiness
he
was
forced
to
drop
into
a
chair
murmuring
feebly
elinor
my
daughter
but
elinor
was
already
at
his
side
he
threw
one
arm
around
her
and
with
the
other
he
held
their
child
on
his
knee
they
gazed
into
each
other
eyes
their
tears
falling
mingling
neither
could
find
a
word
to
express
what
both
were
feeling
then
elinor
leaning
her
head
softly
against
her
lover
shoulder
said
tenderly
yes
this
is
your
daughter
and
your
unknown
lady
your
mistress
friend
and
nurse
who
in
so
many
different
shapes
has
been
caring
for
your
welfare
wants
nothing
henceforth
but
to
be
her
mother
and
your
wife
forgive
me
léon
forgive
me
all
the
troubles
i
have
caused
you
forgive
the
wicked
folly
by
which
i
too
have
suffered
it
was
the
first
offense
and
shall
be
the
last
that
haughty
heedless
unknown
lady
learned
a
salutary
lesson
last
night
at
the
ball
and
your
wife
will
never
forget
it
ah
forgive
me
too
said
léon
my
friend
my
baby
the
dear
objects
of
such
anxiety
and
sorrow
how
shall
i
make
up
to
myself
the
three
years
that
you
have
been
out
of
reach
of
my
love
then
mme
de
gernancé
arrived
and
with
friendly
cordiality
entered
into
the
rapturous
joy
of
the
happy
couple
but
ever
practical
and
sensible
confess
elinor
she
said
to
her
friend
you
would
have
attained
this
happy
end
as
surely
had
you
never
departed
from
the
path
marked
out
for
us
by
duty
and
social
laws
and
you
would
even
have
spared
yourselves
three
years
of
grief
do
let
us
say
anything
more
about
it
said
mme
de
roselis
kissing
her
do
let
us
ever
say
another
word
about
it
i
am
wholly
converted
now
it
is
only
at
the
expense
of
her
happiness
that
a
woman
can
attempt
to
escape
from
the
trammels
that
have
been
imposed
on
her
sex
