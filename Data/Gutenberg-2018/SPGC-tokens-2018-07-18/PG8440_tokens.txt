off

the
time
was
late
in
the
autumn
of
the
second
year
of
the
war
the
place
the
garden
of
a
war
hospital
in
a
small
austrian
town
which
lay
at
the
base
of
wooded
hills
sequestered
as
behind
a
spanish
wall
and
still
preserving
its
sleepy
contented
outlook
upon
existence
day
and
night
the
locomotives
whistled
by
some
of
them
hauled
to
the
front
trains
of
soldiers
singing
and
hallooing
bales
of
hay
bellowing
cattle
and
ammunition
in
cars
the
others
in
the
opposite
direction
came
creeping
homeward
slowly
marked
by
the
bleeding
cross
that
the
war
has
thrown
upon
all
walls
and
the
people
behind
them
but
the
great
madness
raced
through
the
town
like
a
hurricane
without
disturbing
its
calm
as
though
the
low
brightly
colored
houses
with
the
ornate
façades
had
tacitly
come
to
the
sensible
agreement
to
ignore
with
aristocratic
reserve
this
arrogant
blustering
fellow
war
who
turned
everything
in
the
parks
the
children
played
unmolested
with
the
large
russet
leaves
of
the
old
chestnut
trees
women
stood
gossiping
in
front
of
the
shops
and
somewhere
in
every
street
a
girl
with
a
bright
kerchief
on
her
head
could
be
seen
washing
windows
in
spite
of
the
hospital
flags
waving
from
almost
every
house
in
spite
of
innumerable
bulletin
boards
notices
and
that
the
intruder
had
thrust
upon
the
defenseless
town
peace
still
seemed
to
prevail
here
scarcely
fifty
miles
away
from
the
butchery
which
on
clear
nights
threw
its
glow
on
the
horizon
like
an
artificial
illumination
when
for
a
few
moments
at
a
time
there
was
a
lull
in
the
stream
of
heavy
snorting
automobile
trucks
and
rattling
drays
and
no
train
happened
to
be
rumbling
over
the
railroad
bridge
and
no
signal
of
trumpet
or
clanking
of
sabres
sounded
the
strains
of
war
then
the
obstinate
little
place
instantly
showed
up
its
dull
but
provincial
face
only
to
hide
it
again
in
resignation
behind
its
soldier
mask
when
the
next
automobile
from
the
general
staff
came
dashing
around
the
corner
with
a
great
show
of
importance
to
be
sure
the
cannons
growled
in
the
distance
as
if
a
gigantic
dog
were
crouching
way
below
the
ground
ready
to
jump
up
at
the
heavens
snarling
and
snapping
the
muffled
barking
of
the
big
mortars
came
from
over
there
like
a
bad
fit
of
coughing
from
a
sickroom
frightening
the
watchers
who
sit
with
eyes
red
with
crying
listening
for
every
sound
from
the
dying
man
even
the
long
low
rows
of
houses
shrank
together
with
a
rattle
and
listened
horrorstruck
each
time
the
coughing
convulsed
the
earth
as
though
the
stress
of
war
lay
on
the
world
chest
like
a
nightmare
the
streets
exchanged
astonished
glances
blinking
sleepily
in
the
reflection
of
the
that
inside
cast
their
merrily
dancing
shadows
over
close
rows
of
beds
the
rooms
of
misery
sent
piercing
shrieks
and
wails
and
groans
out
into
the
night
every
human
sound
coming
through
the
windows
fell
upon
the
silence
like
a
furious
attack
it
was
a
wild
denunciation
of
the
war
that
out
there
at
the
front
was
doing
its
work
discharging
mangled
human
bodies
like
so
much
offal
and
filling
all
the
houses
with
its
bloody
refuse
but
the
beautiful
fountains
continued
to
gurgle
and
murmur
complacently
prattling
with
soothing
insistence
of
the
days
of
their
youth
when
men
still
had
the
time
and
the
care
for
noble
lines
and
curves
and
war
was
the
affair
of
princes
and
adventurers
legend
popped
out
of
every
corner
and
every
gargoyle
and
ran
on
padded
soles
through
all
the
narrow
little
streets
like
an
invisible
gossip
whispering
of
peace
and
comfort
and
the
ancient
chestnut
trees
nodded
assent
and
with
the
shadows
of
their
outspread
fingers
stroked
the
frightened
façades
to
calm
them
the
past
grew
so
lavishly
out
of
the
fissured
walls
that
any
one
coming
within
their
embrace
heard
the
plashing
of
the
fountains
above
the
thunder
of
the
artillery
and
the
sick
and
wounded
men
felt
soothed
and
listened
from
their
fevered
couches
to
the
talkative
night
outside
pale
men
who
had
been
carried
through
the
town
on
swinging
stretchers
forgot
the
hell
they
had
come
from
and
even
the
heavily
laden
victims
tramping
through
the
place
on
a
forced
march
by
night
became
softened
for
a
space
as
if
they
had
encountered
peace
and
their
own
unarmed
selves
in
the
shadow
of
the
columns
and
the
the
same
thing
took
place
with
the
war
in
this
town
as
with
the
stream
that
came
down
from
out
of
the
mountains
in
the
north
foaming
with
rage
at
each
pebble
it
rolled
over
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
on
passing
the
last
houses
it
took
a
tender
leave
quite
tamed
and
subdued
murmuring
very
gently
as
if
treading
on
tiptoe
as
if
drowsy
with
all
the
dreaminess
it
had
reflected
between
wide
banks
it
stepped
out
into
the
broad
meadowland
and
circled
about
the
war
hospital
making
almost
an
island
of
the
ground
it
stood
on
sycamores
cast
their
shadow
on
the
hospital
and
from
three
sides
came
the
murmur
of
the
slothful
stream
mingled
with
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
as
if
the
garden
when
twilight
fell
was
moved
by
compassion
and
sang
a
slumber
song
for
the
lacerated
men
who
had
to
suffer
in
rank
and
file
regimented
up
to
their
very
death
up
to
the
grave
into
which
they
unfortunate
cobblers
tinkers
peasants
and
clerks
were
shoved
to
the
accompaniment
of
salvos
from
cannon
the
sound
of
taps
had
just
died
away
and
the
watchmen
were
making
their
rounds
when
they
discovered
three
men
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
broad
avenue
and
drove
them
into
the
house
are
you
officers
eh
the
a
stocky
corporal
of
the
landsturm
with
grey
on
his
temples
growled
and
blustered
privates
must
be
in
bed
by
nine
to
preserve
a
show
of
authority
he
added
with
poorly
simulated
bearishness
well
are
you
going
or
not
he
was
about
to
give
his
usual
order
quick
take
to
your
legs
but
caught
himself
just
in
time
and
made
a
face
as
though
he
had
swallowed
something
the
three
men
now
hobbling
toward
the
entrance
for
inmates
would
have
been
only
too
glad
to
carry
out
such
an
order
however
they
had
only
two
legs
and
six
clattering
crutches
between
them
it
was
like
a
living
picture
posed
by
a
stage
manager
who
has
an
eye
for
symmetry
on
the
right
went
the
one
whose
right
leg
had
been
saved
on
the
left
went
his
counterpart
hopping
on
his
left
leg
and
in
the
middle
the
miserable
of
a
human
body
swung
between
two
high
crutches
his
empty
trousers
raised
and
pinned
across
his
chest
so
that
the
whole
man
could
have
gone
comfortably
into
a
cradle
the
corporal
followed
the
group
with
his
eyes
his
head
bent
and
his
fists
clenched
as
if
bowed
down
beneath
the
burden
of
the
sight
he
muttered
a
not
exactly
patriotic
oath
and
spat
out
a
long
curve
of
saliva
with
a
hiss
from
between
his
front
teeth
as
he
was
about
to
turn
and
go
on
his
round
again
a
burst
of
laughter
came
from
the
direction
of
the
officers
wing
he
stood
still
and
drew
in
his
head
as
if
from
a
blow
on
the
back
of
his
neck
and
a
gleam
of
ungovernable
hatred
flitted
over
his
broad
peasant
face
he
spat
out
again
to
soothe
his
feelings
then
took
a
fresh
start
and
passed
the
merry
company
with
a
stiff
salute
the
gentlemen
returned
the
salute
carelessly
infected
by
the
coziness
that
hung
over
the
whole
of
the
town
like
a
light
cloud
they
were
sitting
chatting
in
front
of
the
hospital
on
benches
moved
together
to
form
a
square
they
spoke
of
the
war
and
laughed
laughed
like
happy
schoolboys
discussing
the
miseries
of
examinations
just
gone
through
each
had
done
his
duty
each
had
had
his
ordeal
and
now
under
the
protection
of
his
wound
each
sat
there
in
the
comfortable
expectation
of
returning
home
of
seeing
his
people
again
of
being
fêted
and
for
at
least
two
whole
weeks
of
living
the
life
of
a
man
who
is
not
tagged
with
a
number
the
loudest
of
the
laughers
was
the
young
lieutenant
whom
they
had
nicknamed
the
mussulman
because
of
the
turkish
turban
he
wore
as
officer
of
a
regiment
of
bosnians
a
shell
had
broken
his
leg
and
done
its
work
thoroughly
for
weeks
already
the
shattered
limb
had
been
tightly
encased
in
a
plaster
cast
and
its
owner
who
went
about
on
crutches
cherished
it
carefully
as
though
it
were
some
precious
object
that
had
been
confided
to
his
care
on
the
bench
opposite
the
mussulman
sat
two
gentlemen
a
cavalry
officer
the
only
one
on
the
active
list
and
an
artillery
officer
who
in
civil
life
was
a
professor
of
philosophy
and
so
was
called
philosopher
for
short
the
cavalry
captain
had
received
a
cut
across
his
right
arm
and
the
philosopher
upper
lip
had
been
ripped
by
a
splinter
from
a
grenade
two
ladies
were
sitting
on
the
bench
that
leaned
against
the
wall
of
the
hospital
and
these
three
men
were
monopolizing
the
conversation
with
them
because
the
fourth
man
sat
on
his
bench
without
speaking
he
was
lost
in
his
own
thoughts
his
limbs
twitched
and
his
eyes
wandered
unsteadily
in
the
war
he
was
a
lieutenant
of
the
landsturm
in
civil
life
a
composer
he
had
been
brought
to
the
hospital
a
week
before
suffering
from
severe
shock
horror
still
gloomed
in
his
eyes
and
he
kept
gazing
ahead
of
him
darkly
he
always
allowed
the
attendants
at
the
hospital
to
do
whatever
they
wanted
to
him
without
resistance
and
he
went
to
bed
or
sat
in
the
garden
separated
from
the
others
as
by
an
invisible
wall
at
which
he
stared
and
stared
even
the
unexpected
arrival
of
his
pretty
fair
wife
had
not
resulted
in
dispelling
for
so
much
as
a
second
the
vision
of
the
awful
occurrence
that
had
unbalanced
his
mind
with
his
chin
on
his
chest
he
sat
without
a
smile
while
she
murmured
words
of
endearment
and
whenever
she
tried
to
touch
his
poor
twitching
hands
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
full
of
infinite
love
he
would
jerk
away
as
if
seized
by
a
convulsion
or
under
torture
tears
rolled
down
the
little
woman
cheeks
cheeks
hungry
for
caresses
she
had
fought
her
way
bravely
through
the
zones
barred
to
civilians
until
she
finally
succeeded
in
reaching
this
hospital
in
the
war
zone
and
now
after
the
great
relief
and
joy
of
finding
her
husband
alive
and
unmutilated
she
suddenly
sensed
an
enigmatic
resistance
an
unexpected
obstacle
which
she
could
not
beg
away
or
cry
away
as
she
had
used
to
do
there
was
a
something
there
that
separated
her
mercilessly
from
the
man
she
had
so
yearned
to
see
she
sat
beside
him
impatiently
tortured
by
her
powerlessness
to
find
an
explanation
for
the
hostility
that
he
shed
around
him
her
eyes
pierced
the
darkness
and
her
hands
always
went
the
same
way
groping
forward
timidly
then
quickly
withdrawing
as
though
scorched
when
his
shrinking
away
in
hatred
threw
her
into
despair
again
it
was
hard
to
have
to
choke
down
her
grief
like
this
and
not
burst
out
in
reproach
and
tear
this
secret
from
her
husband
which
he
in
his
misery
still
interposed
so
stubbornly
between
himself
and
his
one
support
and
it
was
hard
to
simulate
happiness
and
take
part
in
the
airy
conversation
hard
always
to
have
to
force
some
sort
of
a
reply
and
hard
not
to
lose
patience
with
the
other
woman
perpetual
giggling
it
was
easy
enough
for
she
knew
that
her
husband
a
was
safe
behind
the
lines
on
the
staff
of
a
high
command
she
had
fled
from
the
ennui
of
a
childless
home
to
enter
into
the
eventful
life
of
the
war
hospital
the
major
wife
had
been
sitting
in
the
garden
with
the
gentlemen
ever
since
seven
always
on
the
point
of
leaving
quite
ready
to
go
in
her
hat
and
jacket
but
she
let
herself
be
induced
again
and
again
to
remain
a
little
longer
she
kept
up
her
flirtatious
conversation
in
the
gayest
of
spirits
as
if
she
had
no
knowledge
of
all
the
torments
she
had
seen
during
the
day
in
the
very
house
against
which
she
was
leaning
her
back
the
sad
little
woman
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
when
it
grew
so
dark
that
she
could
move
away
from
the
frivolous
chatterbox
unnoticed
and
yet
in
spite
of
her
titillating
conversation
and
the
air
of
importance
with
which
she
spoke
of
her
duties
as
a
nurse
the
frau
major
was
penetrated
by
a
feeling
that
without
her
being
conscious
of
it
raised
her
high
above
herself
the
great
wave
of
motherliness
that
had
swept
over
all
the
women
when
the
fatal
hour
struck
for
the
men
had
borne
her
aloft
too
she
had
seen
the
three
men
with
whom
she
was
now
genially
exchanging
light
nothings
come
to
the
hospital
like
thousands
of
others
streaming
with
blood
helpless
whimpering
with
pain
and
something
of
the
joy
of
the
hen
whose
brood
has
safely
hatched
warmed
her
coquetry
since
the
men
have
been
going
for
months
crouching
creeping
on
all
fours
starving
carrying
their
own
death
as
mothers
carry
their
children
since
suffering
and
waiting
and
the
passive
acceptance
of
danger
and
pain
have
reversed
the
sexes
the
women
have
felt
strong
and
even
in
their
sensuality
there
has
been
a
little
glimmer
of
the
new
passion
for
mothering
the
melancholy
wife
just
arrived
from
a
region
in
which
the
war
exists
in
conversation
only
and
engrossed
in
the
one
man
to
the
exclusion
of
the
others
suffered
from
the
sexless
familiarity
that
they
so
freely
indulged
in
there
in
the
shadow
of
death
and
agony
but
the
others
were
at
home
in
the
war
they
spoke
its
language
which
in
the
men
was
a
mixture
of
obstinate
greed
for
life
and
a
paradoxical
softness
born
of
a
surfeit
of
brutality
while
in
the
woman
it
was
a
peculiar
garrulous
she
had
heard
so
much
of
blood
and
dying
that
her
endless
curiosity
gave
the
impression
of
hardness
and
hysterical
cruelty
the
mussulman
and
the
cavalry
officer
were
chaffing
the
philosopher
and
poking
fun
at
the
and
other
wasters
of
time
they
took
a
childish
delight
in
his
broad
smile
of
embarrassment
at
being
teased
in
the
frau
major
presence
and
she
out
of
feminine
politeness
came
to
the
philosopher
rescue
while
casting
amorous
looks
at
the
others
who
could
deal
such
pert
blows
with
their
tongues
oh
let
the
poor
man
alone
she
laughed
and
cooed
he
right
war
is
horrible
these
two
gentlemen
are
just
trying
to
get
your
temper
up
she
twinkled
at
the
philosopher
to
soothe
him
his
good
nature
made
him
so
helpless
the
philosopher
grinned
phlegmatically
and
said
nothing
the
mussulman
setting
his
teeth
shifted
his
leg
which
in
its
white
bandage
was
the
only
part
of
him
that
was
visible
and
placed
it
in
a
more
comfortable
position
on
the
bench
the
philosopher
he
laughed
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
does
the
philosopher
know
about
war
he
in
the
artillery
and
war
is
conducted
by
the
infantry
do
you
know
that
mrs
i
am
not
here
here
i
am
sister
engelberta
she
cut
in
and
for
a
moment
the
expression
on
her
face
became
almost
serious
i
beg
your
pardon
sister
engelberta
artillery
and
infantry

see

like
husband
and
wife
we
infantrymen
must
bring
the
child
into
the
world
when
a
victory
is
to
be
born
the
artillery
has
only
the
pleasure
just
like
a
man
part
in
love
it
is
not
until
after
the
child
has
been
baptized
that
he
comes
strutting
out
proudly
am
i
not
right
captain
he
asked
appealing
to
the
cavalry
officer
you
are
an
equestrian
on
foot
now
too
the
captain
boomed
his
assent
in
his
summary
view
members
of
the
reichstag
who
refused
to
vote
enough
money
for
the
military
socialists
pacifists
all
men
in
brief
who
lectured
or
wrote
or
spoke
superfluous
stuff
and
lived
by
their
brains
belonged
in
the
same
category
as
the
philosopher
they
were
all
bookworms
yes
indeed
he
said
in
his
voice
hoarse
from
shouting
commands
a
philosopher
like
our
friend
here
is
just
the
right
person
for
the
artillery
nothing
to
do
but
wait
around
on
the
top
of
a
hill
and
look
on
if
only
they
do
shoot
up
our
own
men
it
is
easy
enough
to
dispose
of
the
fellows
on
the
other
side
in
front
of
us
but
i
always
have
a
devilish
lot
of
respect
for
you
assassins
in
the
back
but
stop
talking
of
the
war
else
i
go
off
to
bed
here
we
are
at
last
with
two
charming
ladies
when
it
been
an
age
since
we
seen
a
face
that
is
covered
with
stubble
and
you
still
keep
talking
of
that
damned
shooting
good
lord
when
i
was
in
the
hospital
train
and
the
first
girl
came
in
with
a
white
cap
on
her
curly
light
hair
i
have
liked
to
hold
her
hand
and
just
keep
looking
and
looking
at
her
upon
my
word
of
honor
sister
engelberta
after
a
while
the
shooting
gets
to
be
a
nuisance
the
lice
are
worse
but
the
worst
thing
of
all
is
the
complete
absence
of
the
lovely
feminine
for
five
months
to
see
nothing
but
men
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
to
hear
a
dear
clear
woman
voice
that
the
finest
thing
of
all
it
worth
going
to
war
for
the
mussulman
pulled
his
mobile
face
flashing
with
youth
into
a
grimace
the
finest
thing
of
all
no
sir
to
be
quite
frank
the
finest
thing
of
all
is
to
get
a
bath
and
a
fresh
bandage
and
be
put
into
a
clean
white
bed
and
know
that
for
a
few
weeks
you
going
to
have
a
rest
it
a
feeling
like
well
there
no
comparison
for
it
but
of
course
it
is
very
nice
too
to
be
seeing
ladies
again
the
philosopher
had
tilted
his
round
fleshy
epicurean
head
to
one
side
and
a
moist
sheen
came
into
his
small
crafty
eyes
he
glanced
at
the
place
where
a
bright
spot
in
the
almost
palpable
darkness
suggested
the
frau
major
white
dress
and
began
to
tell
what
he
thought
very
slowly
in
a
slight
the
finest
thing
of
all
i
think
is
the
quiet
when
you
have
been
lying
up
there
in
the
mountains
where
every
shot
is
echoed
back
and
forth
five
times
and
all
of
a
sudden
it
turns
absolutely
quiet
no
whistling
no
howling
no
thundering
nothing
but
a
glorious
quiet
that
you
can
listen
to
as
to
a
piece
of
music
the
first
few
nights
i
sat
up
the
whole
time
and
kept
my
ears
cocked
for
the
quiet
the
way
you
try
to
catch
a
tune
at
a
distance
i
believe
i
even
howled
a
bit
it
was
so
delightful
to
listen
to
no
sound
the
captain
of
cavalry
sent
his
cigarette
flying
through
the
night
like
a
comet
scattering
sparks
and
brought
his
hand
down
with
a
thump
on
his
knee
there
there
sister
engelberta
did
you
get
that
he
cried
sarcastically
to
no
sound
you
see
that
what
called
philosophy
i
know
something
better
than
that
philosopher
namely
not
to
hear
what
you
hear
especially
when
it
such
philosophical
rubbish
they
laughed
and
the
man
they
were
teasing
smiled
he
too
was
permeated
by
the
peacefulness
that
floated
into
the
garden
from
the
sleeping
town
the
cavalryman
aggressive
jokes
glided
off
without
leaving
a
sting
as
did
everything
else
that
might
have
lessened
the
sweetness
of
the
few
days
still
lying
between
him
and
the
front
he
wanted
to
make
the
most
of
his
time
and
take
everything
easily
with
his
eyes
tight
shut
like
a
child
who
has
to
enter
a
dark
room
the
frau
major
leaned
over
to
the
philosopher
so
opinions
differ
as
to
what
was
the
finest
thing
she
said
and
her
breath
came
more
rapidly
but
tell
me
what
was
the
most
awful
thing
you
went
through
out
there
a
lot
of
the
men
say
the
drumfire
is
the
worst
and
a
lot
of
them
ca
get
over
the
sight
of
the
first
man
they
saw
killed
how
about
you
the
philosopher
looked
tortured
it
was
a
theme
that
did
not
fit
into
his
programme
he
was
casting
about
for
an
evasive
reply
when
an
unintelligible
wheezing
exclamation
drew
all
eyes
to
the
corner
in
which
the
landsturm
officer
and
his
wife
were
sitting
the
others
had
almost
forgotten
them
in
the
darkness
and
exchanged
frightened
glances
when
they
heard
a
voice
that
scarcely
one
of
them
knew
and
the
man
with
the
glazed
eyes
and
uncertain
gestures
a
marionette
with
broken
joints
began
to
speak
hastily
in
a
falsetto
like
the
crowing
of
a
rooster
what
was
the
most
awful
thing
the
only
awful
thing
is
the
going
off
you
go
off
to
war
and
they
let
you
go
that
the
awful
thing
a
cold
sickening
silence
fell
upon
the
company
even
the
face
lost
its
perpetually
happy
expression
and
stiffened
in
embarrassment
it
had
come
so
unexpectedly
and
sounded
so
unintelligible
it
caught
them
by
the
throat
and
set
their
pulses
bounding
perhaps
because
of
the
vibrating
of
the
voice
that
issued
from
the
twitching
body
or
because
of
the
rattling
that
went
along
with
it
and
made
it
sound
like
a
voice
broken
by
long
sobbing
the
frau
major
jumped
up
she
had
seen
the
landsturm
officer
brought
to
the
hospital
strapped
fast
to
the
stretcher
because
his
sobbing
wrenched
and
tore
his
body
so
that
the
bearers
could
not
control
him
otherwise
something
inexpressibly
hideous
so
it
was
said
had
half
robbed
the
poor
devil
of
his
reason
and
the
frau
major
suddenly
dreaded
a
fit
of
insanity
she
pinched
the
cavalryman
arm
and
exclaimed
with
a
pretense
of
great
haste
my
goodness
there
the
gong
of
the
last
car
quick
quick
addressing
the
sick
man
wife
quick
we
must
run
they
all
rose
the
frau
major
passed
her
arm
through
the
unhappy
little
woman
and
urged
with
even
greater
insistence
we
have
a
whole
hour
walk
back
to
town
if
we
miss
the
car
the
little
wife
completely
at
a
loss
her
whole
body
quivering
bent
over
her
husband
again
to
take
leave
she
was
certain
that
his
outburst
had
reference
to
her
and
held
a
grim
deadly
reproach
which
she
did
not
comprehend
she
felt
her
husband
draw
back
and
start
convulsively
under
the
touch
of
her
lips
and
she
sobbed
aloud
at
the
awful
prospect
of
spending
an
endless
night
in
the
chilly
neglected
room
in
the
hotel
left
alone
with
this
tormenting
doubt
but
the
frau
major
drew
her
along
forcing
her
to
run
and
did
not
let
go
her
arm
until
they
had
passed
the
sentinel
at
the
gate
and
were
out
on
the
street
the
gentlemen
followed
them
with
their
eyes
saw
them
reappear
once
again
on
the
street
in
the
lamplight
and
listened
to
the
sound
of
the
car
receding
in
the
distance
the
mussulman
picked
up
his
crutches
and
winked
at
the
philosopher
significantly
and
said
something
with
a
yawn
about
going
to
bed
the
cavalry
officer
looked
down
at
the
sick
man
curiously
and
felt
sorry
for
him
wanting
to
give
the
poor
devil
a
bit
of
pleasure
he
tapped
him
on
his
shoulder
and
said
in
his
free
and
easy
way
you
got
a
chic
wife
i
must
say
i
congratulate
you
the
next
instant
he
drew
back
startled
the
pitiful
heap
on
the
bench
jumped
up
suddenly
as
though
a
force
just
awakened
had
tossed
him
up
from
his
seat
chic
wife
oh
yes
very
dashing
came
sputtering
from
his
twitching
lips
with
a
fury
that
cast
out
the
words
like
a
seething
stream
she
did
shed
a
single
tear
when
i
left
on
the
train
oh
they
were
all
very
dashing
when
we
went
off
poor
dill
wife
was
too
very
plucky
she
threw
roses
at
him
in
the
train
and
she
been
his
wife
for
only
two
months
he
chuckled
disdainfully
and
clenched
his
teeth
fighting
hard
to
suppress
the
tears
burning
in
his
threat
roses
and
you
soon
again
they
were
all
so
patriotic
our
colonel
congratulated
dill
because
his
wife
had
restrained
herself
so
well
as
if
he
were
simply
going
off
to
maneuvers
the
lieutenant
was
now
standing
up
he
swayed
on
his
legs
which
he
held
wide
apart
and
supported
himself
on
the
cavalry
captain
arm
and
looked
up
into
his
face
expectantly
with
unsteady
eyes
do
you
know
what
happened
to
him
to
dill
i
was
there
do
you
know
what
the
captain
looked
at
the
others
in
dismay
come
on
come
on
to
bed
do
excite
yourself
he
stammered
in
embarrassment
with
a
howl
of
triumph
the
sick
man
cut
him
short
and
snapped
in
an
unnaturally
high
voice
you
do
know
what
happened
to
dill
you
do
we
were
standing
just
the
way
we
are
now
and
he
was
just
going
to
show
me
the
new
photograph
that
his
wife
had
sent
him
his
brave
wife
his
restrained
wife
oh
yes
restrained
that
what
they
all
were
all
prepared
for
anything
and
while
we
were
standing
there
he
about
to
show
me
the
picture
a
struck
quite
a
distance
away
from
us
a
good
yards
we
did
even
look
that
way
then
all
of
a
sudden
i
saw
something
black
come
flying
through
the
air
and
dill
fell
over
with
his
dashing
wife
picture
in
his
hand
and
a
boot
a
leg
a
boot
with
the
leg
of
a
baggage
soldier
sticking
in
his
head
a
soldier
that
the
had
blown
to
pieces
far
away
from
where
we
stood
he
stopped
for
an
instant
and
stared
at
the
captain
triumphantly
then
he
went
on
with
a
note
of
spiteful
pride
in
his
voice
though
every
now
and
then
interrupted
by
a
peculiar
gurgling
groan
poor
dill
never
said
another
word
dill
with
the
spur
sticking
in
his
skull
a
regular
cavalry
spur
as
big
as
a
piece
he
only
turned
up
the
whites
of
his
eyes
a
little
and
looked
sadly
at
his
picture
that
she
should
have
permitted
such
a
thing
as
that
such
a
thing
as
that
such
a
thing
it
took
four
of
us
to
pull
the
boot
out
four
of
us
we
had
to
turn
it
and
twist
it
until
a
piece
of
his
brain
came
along
like
roots
pulled
up
like
a
jellyfish
a
dead
one
sticking
to
the
spur
shut
up
the
captain
yelled
furiously
and
tore
himself
away
and
walked
into
the
house
cursing
the
other
two
looked
after
him
longingly
but
they
could
not
let
the
unfortunate
man
stay
there
by
himself
when
the
captain
had
withdrawn
his
arm
he
had
fallen
down
on
the
bench
again
and
sat
whimpering
like
a
whipped
child
with
his
head
leaning
on
the
back
the
philosopher
touched
his
shoulder
gently
and
was
about
to
speak
to
him
kindly
and
induce
him
to
go
into
the
house
when
he
started
up
again
and
broke
out
into
an
ugly
snarling
laugh
but
we
tore
her
out
of
him
his
dashing
wife
four
of
us
had
to
tug
and
pull
until
she
came
out
i
got
him
rid
of
her
out
with
her
she
gone
all
of
them
are
gone
mine
is
gone
too
mine
is
torn
out
too
all
are
being
torn
out
there
no
wife
any
more
no
wife
any
more
no
his
head
bobbed
and
fell
forward
tears
slowly
rolled
down
his
sad
sad
face
the
captain
reappeared
followed
by
the
little
assistant
physician
who
was
on
night
duty
you
must
go
to
bed
now
lieutenant
the
physician
said
with
affected
severity
the
sick
man
threw
his
head
up
and
stared
blankly
at
the
strange
face
when
the
physician
repeated
the
order
in
a
raised
voice
his
eyes
suddenly
gleamed
and
he
nodded
approvingly
must
go
of
course
he
repeated
eagerly
and
drew
a
deep
sigh
we
all
must
go
the
man
who
does
go
is
a
coward
and
they
have
no
use
for
a
coward
that
the
very
thing
do
you
understand
heroes
are
the
style
now
the
chic
dill
wanted
a
hero
to
match
her
new
hat
that
why
poor
dill
had
to
go
and
lose
his
brains
i
too
you
too
we
must
go
die
you
must
let
yourself
be
trampled
on
your
brains
trampled
on
while
the
women
look
on
chic
because
it
the
style
now
he
raised
his
emaciated
body
painfully
holding
on
to
the
back
of
the
bench
and
eyed
each
man
in
turn
waiting
for
assent
is
it
sad
he
asked
softly
then
his
voice
rose
suddenly
to
a
shriek
again
and
the
sound
of
his
fury
rang
out
weirdly
in
the
garden
were
they
deceiving
us
eh
i
like
to
know
were
they
cheats
was
i
an
assassin
was
i
a
ruffian
did
i
suit
her
when
i
sat
at
the
piano
playing
we
were
expected
to
be
gentle
and
considerate
considerate
and
all
at
once
because
the
fashion
changed
they
had
to
have
murderers
do
you
understand
murderers
he
broke
away
from
the
physician
and
stood
swaying
again
and
his
voice
gradually
sank
to
a
complaining
sound
like
the
thick
strangulated
utterance
of
a
drunkard
my
wife
was
in
fashion
too
you
know
not
a
tear
i
kept
waiting
and
waiting
for
her
to
begin
to
scream
and
beg
me
at
last
to
get
out
of
the
train
and
not
go
with
the
others
beg
me
to
be
a
coward
for
her
sake
not
one
of
them
had
the
courage
to
they
just
wanted
to
be
in
fashion
mine
too
mine
too
she
waved
her
handkerchief
just
like
all
the
rest
his
twitching
arms
writhed
upwards
as
though
he
were
calling
the
heavens
to
witness
you
want
to
know
what
was
the
most
awful
thing
he
groaned
turning
to
the
philosopher
abruptly
the
disillusionment
was
the
most
awful
thing
the
going
off
the
war
was
the
war
is
what
it
has
to
be
did
it
surprise
you
to
find
out
that
war
is
horrible
the
only
surprising
thing
was
the
going
off
to
find
out
that
the
women
are
horrible
that
was
the
surprising
thing
that
they
can
smile
and
throw
roses
that
they
can
give
up
their
men
their
children
the
boys
they
have
put
to
bed
a
thousand
times
and
pulled
the
covers
over
a
thousand
times
and
petted
and
brought
up
to
be
men
that
was
the
surprise
that
they
gave
us
up
that
they
sent
us
us
because
every
one
of
them
would
have
been
ashamed
to
stand
there
without
a
hero
that
was
the
great
disillusionment
do
you
think
we
should
have
gone
if
they
had
not
sent
us
do
you
think
so
just
ask
the
stupidest
peasant
out
there
why
like
to
have
a
medal
before
going
back
on
furlough
because
if
he
has
a
medal
his
girl
will
like
him
better
and
the
other
girls
will
run
after
him
and
he
can
use
his
medal
to
hook
other
men
women
away
from
under
their
noses
that
the
reason
the
only
reason
the
women
sent
us
no
general
could
have
made
us
go
if
the
women
had
allowed
us
to
be
stacked
on
the
trains
if
they
had
screamed
out
that
they
would
never
look
at
us
again
if
we
turned
into
murderers
not
a
single
man
would
have
gone
off
if
they
had
sworn
never
to
give
themselves
to
a
man
who
has
split
open
other
men
skulls
and
shot
and
bayoneted
human
beings
not
one
man
i
tell
you
would
have
gone
i
did
want
to
believe
that
they
could
stand
it
like
that
only
pretending
i
thought
just
restraining
themselves
but
when
the
first
whistle
blows
they
begin
to
scream
and
tear
us
out
of
the
train
and
rescue
us
they
had
the
chance
to
protect
us
but
all
they
cared
about
was
being
in
style
nothing
else
in
the
world
but
just
being
in
style
he
sank
down
on
the
bench
again
and
sat
as
though
he
were
all
broken
up
his
body
was
shaken
by
a
low
weeping
and
his
head
rolled
to
and
fro
on
his
panting
chest
a
little
circle
of
people
had
gathered
behind
his
back
the
old
landsturm
corporal
was
standing
beside
the
physician
with
four
sentries
ready
to
intervene
at
a
moment
notice
all
the
windows
in
the
officers
wing
had
lighted
up
and
scantily
clad
figures
leaned
out
looking
down
into
the
garden
curiously
the
sick
man
eagerly
scrutinized
the
indifferent
faces
around
him
he
was
exhausted
his
hoarse
throat
no
longer
gave
forth
a
sound
his
hand
reached
out
for
help
to
the
philosopher
who
stood
beside
him
all
upset
the
physician
felt
the
right
moment
had
come
to
lead
him
away
come
lieutenant
let
go
to
sleep
he
said
with
a
clumsy
affectation
of
geniality
that
the
way
women
are
once
for
all
and
nothing
to
be
done
about
it
the
physician
wanted
to
go
on
talking
and
in
conversing
lure
the
sick
man
into
the
house
unawares
but
the
very
next
sentence
remained
sticking
in
his
throat
and
he
stopped
short
in
amazement
the
limp
wobbling
skeleton
that
only
a
moment
before
had
sat
there
as
in
a
faint
and
let
himself
be
raised
up
by
the
physician
and
the
philosopher
suddenly
jumped
up
with
a
jerk
and
tore
his
arms
away
so
violently
that
the
two
men
who
were
about
to
assist
him
were
sent
tumbling
up
against
the
others
he
bent
over
with
crooked
knees
staggering
like
a
man
carrying
a
heavy
load
on
his
back
his
veins
swelled
and
he
panted
with
fury
that
the
way
women
are
once
for
all
are
they
since
when
eh
have
you
never
heard
of
the
suffragettes
who
boxed
the
ears
of
prime
ministers
and
set
fire
to
museums
and
let
themselves
be
chained
to
for
the
sake
of
the
vote
for
the
sake
of
the
vote
do
you
hear
but
for
the
sake
of
their
men
no
not
one
sound
not
one
single
outcry
he
stopped
to
take
breath
overcome
by
a
wild
suffocating
despair
then
he
pulled
himself
together
once
more
and
with
difficulty
suppressing
the
sobs
which
kept
bringing
a
lump
into
his
throat
he
screamed
in
deepest
misery
like
a
hunted
animal
have
you
heard
of
one
woman
throwing
herself
in
front
of
a
train
for
the
sake
of
her
husband
has
a
single
one
of
them
boxed
the
ears
of
a
prime
minister
or
tied
herself
to
a
railroad
track
for
us
there
one
that
had
to
be
torn
away
not
one
fought
for
us
or
defended
us
not
one
moved
a
little
finger
for
us
in
the
whole
wide
world
they
drove
us
out
they
gagged
us
they
gave
us
the
spur
like
poor
dill
they
sent
us
to
murder
they
sent
us
to
die
for
their
vanity
are
you
going
to
defend
them
no
they
must
be
pulled
out
pulled
out
like
weeds
by
the
roots
four
of
you
together
must
pull
the
way
we
had
to
do
with
dill
four
of
you
together
then
she
have
to
come
out
are
you
the
doctor
there
do
it
to
my
head
i
do
want
a
wife
pull
pull
her
out
he
flung
out
his
arm
and
his
fist
came
down
like
a
hammer
on
his
own
skull
and
his
crooked
fingers
clutched
pitilessly
at
the
sparse
growth
of
hair
on
the
back
of
his
head
until
he
held
up
a
whole
handful
torn
out
by
the
roots
and
howled
with
pain
the
doctor
gave
a
sign
and
the
next
moment
the
four
sentries
were
on
him
panting
he
screamed
gnashed
his
teeth
beat
about
him
kicked
himself
free
shook
off
his
assailants
like
burrs
it
was
not
until
the
old
corporal
and
the
doctor
came
to
their
assistance
that
they
succeeded
in
dragging
him
into
the
house
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
the
people
left
the
garden
the
last
to
go
were
the
mussulman
and
the
philosopher
the
mussulman
stopped
at
the
door
and
in
the
light
of
the
lantern
looked
gravely
down
at
his
leg
which
in
its
plaster
cast
hung
like
a
dead
thing
between
his
two
crutches
do
you
know
philosopher
he
said
i
much
rather
have
this
stick
of
mine
the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
to
one
out
there
is
to
go
crazy
like
that
poor
devil
rather
off
with
one
head
altogether
and
be
done
with
it
or
do
you
think
he
still
has
a
chance
the
philosopher
said
nothing
his
round
face
had
gone
ashen
pale
and
his
eyes
were
swimming
with
tears
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
helped
his
comrade
up
the
steps
without
speaking
on
entering
the
ward
they
heard
the
banging
of
doors
somewhere
far
away
in
the
house
and
a
muffled
cry
then
everything
was
still
one
by
one
the
lights
went
out
in
the
windows
of
the
officers
wing
soon
the
garden
lay
like
a
bushy
black
island
in
the
river
silent
embrace
only
now
and
then
a
gust
of
wind
brought
from
the
west
the
coughing
of
the
guns
like
a
faint
echo
once
more
a
crunching
sound
was
heard
on
the
gravel
it
was
the
four
sentries
marching
back
to
the
one
soldier
was
cursing
under
his
breath
as
he
tried
to
refasten
his
torn
blouse
the
others
were
breathing
heavily
and
were
wiping
the
sweat
from
their
red
foreheads
with
the
backs
of
their
hands
the
old
corporal
brought
up
the
rear
his
pipe
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
his
head
bent
low
as
he
turned
into
the
main
walk
a
bright
sheet
of
light
lit
up
the
sky
and
a
prolonged
rumbling
that
finally
sank
into
the
earth
with
a
growl
shook
all
the
windows
of
the
hospital
the
old
man
stood
still
and
listened
until
the
rumbling
had
died
away
then
he
shook
his
clenched
fist
and
sent
out
a
long
curve
of
saliva
from
between
his
set
teeth
and
muttered
in
a
disgust
that
came
from
the
depths
of
his
soul
hell
ii
baptism
of
fire
the
company
rested
for
half
an
hour
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
then
captain
marschner
gave
the
command
to
start
he
was
pale
in
spite
of
the
killing
heat
and
he
turned
his
eyes
aside
when
he
gave
lieutenant
weixler
instructions
that
in
ten
minutes
every
man
should
be
ready
for
the
march
without
fail
he
had
really
forced
his
own
hand
in
giving
the
order
for
now
he
knew
very
well
there
could
be
no
delay
whenever
he
left
weixler
loose
on
the
privates
everything
went
like
they
trembled
before
this
lad
of
barely
twenty
as
though
he
were
the
devil
incarnate
and
sometimes
it
actually
seemed
to
the
captain
himself
as
though
there
were
something
uncanny
about
that
overgrown
bony
figure
never
by
any
chance
did
a
spark
of
warmth
flash
from
those
small
piercing
eyes
which
always
mirrored
a
flickering
unrest
and
gleamed
as
though
from
fever
the
one
young
thing
in
his
whole
personality
was
the
small
shy
moustache
above
the
compressed
lips
which
never
opened
except
to
ask
in
a
mean
harsh
way
for
some
soldier
to
be
punished
for
almost
a
year
captain
marschner
had
lived
side
by
side
with
him
and
had
never
yet
heard
him
laugh
knew
nothing
of
his
family
nor
from
where
he
came
nor
whether
he
had
any
ties
at
all
he
spoke
rarely
in
brief
quick
sentences
and
brought
out
his
words
in
a
hiss
like
the
seething
of
a
suppressed
rage
and
his
only
topic
was
the
service
or
the
war
as
though
outside
these
two
things
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
world
worth
talking
about
and
this
man
of
all
others
fate
had
tricked
by
keeping
him
in
the
hinterland
for
the
whole
first
year
of
the
war
the
war
had
been
going
on
for
eleven
months
and
a
half
and
lieutenant
weixler
had
not
yet
seen
an
enemy
at
the
very
outset
when
only
a
few
miles
across
the
russian
frontier
typhus
had
caught
him
before
he
had
fired
a
single
shot
now
at
last
he
was
going
to
face
the
enemy
captain
marschner
knew
that
the
young
man
had
a
private
rifle
dragged
along
for
his
own
use
and
had
sacrificed
all
his
savings
for
special
in
order
to
be
quite
on
the
safe
side
and
know
exactly
how
many
enemy
lives
he
had
snuffed
out
since
they
had
come
within
close
sound
of
the
firing
he
had
grown
almost
merry
even
talkative
impelled
by
a
nervous
zeal
like
an
enthusiastic
hunter
who
has
picked
up
the
trail
the
captain
saw
him
going
in
and
out
among
the
massed
men
and
turned
away
hating
to
see
how
the
fellow
plagued
his
poor
weary
men
and
went
at
them
precisely
like
a
sheep
dog
gathering
in
the
herd
barking
shrilly
all
the
while
long
before
the
ten
minutes
were
up
the
company
would
be
in
formation
weixler
impatience
guaranteed
that
and
then
then
there
would
be
no
reason
any
more
for
longer
delay
no
further
possibility
of
putting
off
the
fatal
decision
captain
marschner
took
a
deep
breath
and
looked
up
at
the
sky
with
eyes
that
had
a
peculiarly
intent
look
in
them
in
the
foreground
beyond
the
steep
hill
that
still
hid
the
actual
field
of
battle
from
view
the
invisible
machine
guns
were
beating
in
breathless
haste
and
scarcely
a
fathom
above
the
edge
of
the
slope
small
packages
floated
in
thick
clusters
like
snowballs
flung
high
in
the
air
the
smoke
of
the
barrage
fire
through
which
he
had
to
lead
his
men
it
was
not
a
short
way
two
kilometers
still
from
the
farther
spur
of
the
hill
to
the
entrance
of
the
communication
trenches
and
straight
across
open
fields
without
cover
of
any
kind
assuredly
no
small
task
for
a
company
of
the
last
class
of
reservists
for
respectable
family
men
who
had
been
in
the
field
but
a
few
hours
and
who
were
only
now
to
smell
powder
for
the
first
time
and
receive
their
baptism
of
fire
for
weixler
whose
mind
was
set
on
nothing
but
the
medal
for
distinguished
service
which
he
wanted
to
obtain
as
soon
as
possible
for
a
fighting
cock
who
fancied
the
world
rotated
about
his
own
most
important
person
and
had
had
no
time
to
estimate
the
truer
values
of
life
for
him
it
might
be
no
more
than
an
exciting
promenade
a
new
sting
to
the
nerves
a
fine
way
of
becoming
thoroughly
conscious
of
one
personality
and
placing
one
fearlessness
in
a
more
brilliant
light
probably
he
had
long
been
secretly
deriding
his
old
indecision
and
had
cursed
the
last
halt
because
it
forced
him
to
wait
another
half
hour
to
achieve
his
first
deed
of
heroism
marschner
mowed
down
the
tall
blades
of
grass
with
his
riding
whip
and
from
time
to
time
glanced
at
his
company
surreptitiously
he
could
tell
by
the
way
the
men
dragged
themselves
to
their
feet
with
a
sort
of
resistance
like
children
roused
from
sleep
that
they
fully
understood
where
they
were
now
to
go
the
complete
silence
in
which
they
packed
their
bundles
and
fell
into
line
made
his
heart
contract
ever
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
he
had
been
preparing
himself
for
this
moment
without
relax
he
had
brooded
over
it
day
and
night
had
told
himself
a
thousand
times
that
where
a
higher
interest
is
at
stake
the
misery
of
the
individual
counts
for
nothing
and
a
conscientious
leader
must
armor
himself
with
indifference
and
now
he
stood
there
and
observed
with
terror
how
all
his
good
resolutions
crumbled
and
nothing
remained
in
him
but
an
impassioned
boundless
pity
for
these
driven
who
prepared
themselves
with
such
quiet
resignation
it
was
as
if
they
were
taking
their
life
into
their
hands
like
a
costly
vessel
in
order
to
carry
it
into
battle
and
cast
it
at
the
feet
of
the
enemy
as
though
the
least
thing
they
owned
was
that
which
would
soon
be
crashing
into
fragments
his
friends
among
whom
he
was
known
as
uncle
marschner
would
not
have
dared
to
suggest
his
sending
a
rabbit
he
had
reared
to
the
butcher
or
dragging
a
dog
that
had
won
his
affection
to
the
pound
and
now
he
was
to
drive
into
shrapnel
fire
men
whom
he
himself
had
trained
to
be
soldiers
and
had
had
under
his
own
eyes
for
months
men
whom
he
knew
as
he
did
his
own
pockets
of
what
avail
were
subtle
or
deep
reflections
now
he
saw
nothing
but
the
glances
of
dread
and
beseeching
that
his
men
turned
on
him
asking
protection
as
though
they
believed
that
their
captain
could
prescribe
a
path
even
for
bullets
and
shells
and
now
was
he
to
abuse
their
confidence
was
he
to
marshal
these
bearded
children
to
death
and
not
feel
any
emotion
only
two
days
before
he
had
seen
them
surrounded
by
their
little
ones
saying
to
their
sobbing
wives
was
he
to
march
on
without
caring
if
one
or
another
of
them
was
hit
and
fell
over
and
rolled
in
agony
in
his
blood
whence
was
he
to
take
the
strength
for
such
hardness
of
heart
from
that
higher
interest
it
had
faded
away
it
was
impalpable
it
was
too
much
a
matter
of
mere
words
too
much
mere
sound
for
him
to
think
that
it
could
fool
his
soldiers
who
looked
forward
to
the
barrage
fire
in
dread
with
souls
lieutenant
weixler
and
radiant
came
and
shouted
in
his
face
that
the
company
was
ready
it
struck
the
captain
like
a
blow
below
the
belt
it
sounded
like
a
challenge
the
captain
could
not
help
hearing
in
it
the
insolent
question
well
why
are
you
as
glad
of
the
danger
as
i
am
every
drop
of
captain
marschner
blood
rose
to
his
temples
he
had
to
look
aside
and
his
eyes
wandered
involuntarily
up
to
the
shrapnel
clouds
bearing
a
prayer
a
silent
invocation
to
those
senseless
things
up
there
rattling
down
so
indiscriminately
a
prayer
that
they
would
teach
this
boy
suffering
convince
him
that
he
was
vulnerable
but
a
moment
later
he
bowed
his
head
in
shame
his
anger
grew
against
the
man
who
had
been
able
to
arouse
such
a
feeling
in
him
thank
you
let
the
men
stand
at
rest
i
must
look
after
the
horses
once
more
he
said
in
measured
tones
with
a
forced
composure
that
soothed
him
he
did
not
intend
to
be
hustled
now
less
than
ever
he
was
glad
to
see
the
lieutenant
give
a
start
and
he
smiled
to
himself
with
quiet
satisfaction
at
the
indignant
face
the
defiant
yes
sir
said
in
a
voice
no
longer
so
loud
and
so
clear
but
coming
through
gnashed
teeth
from
a
contracted
throat
the
boy
was
for
once
in
his
turn
to
experience
how
it
feels
to
be
held
in
check
he
was
so
fond
of
intoxicating
himself
with
his
own
power
at
the
cost
of
the
privates
triumphing
as
though
it
were
the
force
of
his
own
personality
that
lorded
it
over
them
and
not
the
rule
of
the
service
that
was
always
backing
him
captain
marschner
walked
back
to
the
woods
deliberately
doubly
glad
of
the
lesson
he
had
just
given
weixler
because
it
also
meant
a
brief
respite
for
his
old
boys
perhaps
a
shell
would
hurtle
down
into
the
earth
before
their
noses
and
so
these
few
minutes
would
save
the
lives
of
twenty
men
perhaps
it
might
turn
out
just
the
other
way
too
those
very
minutes
ah
what
was
the
use
of
speculating
it
was
better
not
to
think
at
all
he
wanted
to
help
the
men
as
much
as
he
could
but
he
could
not
be
a
savior
to
any
of
them
and
yet
perhaps
one
man
had
just
come
rushing
up
to
him
from
the
woods
this
one
man
he
was
managing
to
shelter
for
the
present
he
and
six
others
were
to
stay
behind
with
the
horses
and
the
baggage
was
it
an
injustice
to
detail
this
particular
man
all
the
other
officers
were
older
and
married
the
short
fat
man
with
the
even
had
six
children
at
home
could
he
justify
himself
at
the
bar
of
his
conscience
for
leaving
this
young
unmarried
man
here
in
safety
with
a
furious
gesture
the
captain
interrupted
his
thoughts
he
would
have
liked
best
to
catch
hold
of
his
own
chest
and
give
himself
a
sound
shaking
why
could
he
not
rid
himself
of
that
confounded
brooding
and
pondering
the
right
and
wrong
of
things
was
there
any
justice
at
all
left
here
here
in
the
domain
of
the
shells
that
spared
the
worst
and
laid
low
the
best
had
he
not
quite
made
up
his
mind
to
leave
his
conscience
his
his
sympathy
and
all
his
superfluous
thoughts
at
home
along
with
his
civilian
clothes
packed
away
in
camphor
in
the
house
where
he
lived
in
peace
times
all
these
things
were
part
of
the
civil
engineer
rudolf
marschner
who
once
upon
a
time
had
been
an
officer
but
who
had
returned
to
school
when
thirty
years
old
to
exchange
the
trade
of
war
into
which
he
had
wandered
in
the
folly
of
youth
for
a
profession
that
harmonized
better
with
his
gentle
thoughtful
nature
that
this
war
had
now
twenty
years
later
turned
him
into
a
soldier
again
was
a
misfortune
a
catastrophe
which
had
overtaken
him
as
it
had
all
the
others
without
any
fault
of
his
or
theirs
yet
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
reconcile
himself
to
it
and
first
of
all
he
had
to
avoid
that
constant
why
torment
himself
so
with
questions
some
man
had
to
stay
behind
in
the
woods
as
a
guard
the
commander
had
decided
on
the
young
sergeant
and
the
young
sergeant
would
stay
behind
that
settled
it
the
painful
thing
was
the
way
the
fellow
face
so
plainly
showed
his
emotion
his
eyes
moistened
and
looked
at
the
captain
in
gratitude
disgusting
simply
disgusting
and
what
possessed
the
man
to
stammer
out
something
about
his
mother
he
was
to
stay
behind
because
the
service
required
it
his
mother
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
she
was
safe
in
vienna
and
here
it
was
war
the
captain
told
the
man
so
he
could
not
let
him
think
it
was
a
bit
of
good
fortune
a
special
dispensation
not
to
have
to
go
into
battle
captain
marschner
felt
easier
the
minute
he
had
finished
scolding
the
crushed
sinner
his
conscience
was
now
quite
clear
just
as
though
it
had
really
been
by
chance
that
he
had
placed
the
man
at
that
post
but
the
feeling
did
not
last
very
long
the
silly
fellow
would
not
give
up
adoring
him
as
his
savior
and
when
he
stammered
i
take
the
liberty
of
wishing
you
good
luck
captain
standing
in
stiff
military
attitude
but
in
a
voice
hoarse
and
quivering
from
suppressed
tears
such
fervor
such
ardent
devotion
radiated
from
his
wish
that
the
captain
suddenly
felt
a
strange
emptiness
again
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
and
he
turned
sharply
and
walked
away
now
he
knew
now
he
could
approximately
calculate
all
the
things
weixler
had
observed
in
him
now
he
could
guess
how
the
fellow
must
have
made
secret
fun
of
his
sensitiveness
if
this
simple
man
this
mere
carpenter
journeyman
could
guess
his
innermost
thoughts
for
he
had
not
spoken
to
him
once
simply
the
night
before
last
at
the
entrainment
in
vienna
he
had
furtively
observed
his
leavetaking
from
his
mother
how
had
the
confounded
fellow
come
to
suspect
that
the
wizened
shrunken
little
old
hag
whose
skin
dried
by
long
living
hung
in
a
thousand
loose
folds
from
her
had
made
such
an
impression
on
his
captain
the
man
himself
certainly
did
not
know
how
touching
it
looked
when
the
tiny
mother
gazed
up
at
him
from
below
and
stroked
his
broad
chest
with
her
trembling
hand
because
she
could
not
reach
his
face
no
one
could
have
betrayed
to
the
soldier
that
since
then
whenever
his
company
commander
looked
at
him
he
could
not
help
seeing
the
hand
with
its
knotted
distorted
fingers
which
had
touched
the
rough
hairy
cloth
with
such
ineffable
love
and
yet
somehow
the
rascal
had
discovered
that
this
hand
floated
above
him
protectingly
that
it
prayed
for
him
and
had
softened
the
heart
of
his
officer
marschner
tramped
across
the
meadow
in
rage
against
himself
he
was
as
ashamed
as
though
some
one
had
torn
a
mask
from
his
face
was
it
as
easy
as
that
to
see
through
him
then
in
spite
of
all
the
trouble
he
took
he
stopped
to
get
his
breath
hewed
at
the
grass
again
with
his
riding
whip
and
cursed
aloud
oh
well
he
simply
could
act
a
part
could
step
out
of
his
skin
suddenly
even
though
there
was
a
world
war
a
thousand
times
over
he
used
to
let
his
nephews
and
nieces
twist
him
round
their
fingers
and
laughed
when
they
did
it
in
a
single
day
he
could
not
change
into
a
and
go
merrily
upon
the
what
an
utterly
mad
idea
it
was
too
to
try
to
cast
all
people
into
the
same
mould
no
one
dreamed
of
making
a
philanthropist
of
weixler
and
he
was
supposed
so
lightly
to
turn
straight
into
a
militarist
he
was
no
longer
twenty
like
weixler
and
these
sad
silent
men
who
had
been
so
cruelly
uprooted
from
their
lives
were
each
of
them
far
more
to
him
than
a
mere
rifle
to
be
sent
to
the
repair
shop
if
broken
or
to
be
indifferently
discarded
if
smashed
beyond
repair
whoever
had
looked
on
life
from
all
sides
and
reflected
upon
it
could
not
so
easily
turn
into
the
mere
soldier
like
his
lieutenant
who
had
not
been
humanized
yet
nor
seen
the
world
from
any
point
of
view
but
the
military
school
and
the
barracks
ah
yes
if
conditions
still
were
as
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
when
none
but
young
fellows
happy
to
be
off
on
an
adventure
hallooed
from
the
train
windows
if
they
left
any
dear
ones
at
all
behind
they
were
only
their
parents
and
here
at
last
was
a
chance
to
make
a
great
impression
on
the
old
folks
then
captain
marschner
would
have
held
his
own
as
well
as
anyone
as
well
even
as
the
strict
disciplinarian
lieutenant
weixler
perhaps
even
better
then
the
men
marched
two
or
three
weeks
before
coming
upon
the
enemy
and
the
links
that
bound
them
to
life
broke
off
one
at
a
time
they
underwent
a
thousand
difficulties
and
deprivations
until
under
the
stress
of
hunger
and
thirst
and
weariness
they
gradually
forgot
everything
they
had
left
far
far
behind
in
those
days
hatred
of
the
enemy
who
had
done
them
all
that
harm
smouldered
and
flared
higher
every
day
while
actual
battle
was
a
relief
after
the
long
period
of
passive
suffering
but
now
things
went
like
lightning
day
before
yesterday
in
vienna
still
and
now
with
the
farewell
kisses
still
on
one
lips
scarcely
torn
from
another
arms
straight
into
the
fire
and
not
blindly
unsuspectingly
like
the
first
ones
for
these
poor
devils
now
the
war
had
no
secrets
left
each
of
them
had
already
lost
some
relative
or
friend
each
had
talked
to
wounded
men
had
seen
mutilated
distorted
invalids
and
knew
more
about
shell
wounds
gas
grenades
and
liquid
fire
than
artillery
generals
or
staff
physicians
had
known
before
the
war
and
now
it
was
the
captain
lot
to
lead
precisely
these
clairvoyants
these
men
so
rudely
torn
up
by
the
roots
he
the
retired
captain
the
civilian
who
at
first
had
had
to
stay
at
home
training
recruits
now
that
it
was
a
thousand
times
harder
now
his
turn
had
come
to
be
a
leader
and
he
dared
not
resist
the
task
to
which
he
was
not
equal
on
the
contrary
as
a
matter
of
decency
he
had
been
forced
to
push
his
claims
so
that
others
who
had
already
shed
their
blood
out
there
should
not
have
to
go
again
for
him
a
dull
impotent
rage
came
over
him
when
he
stepped
up
in
front
of
his
men
ranged
in
deep
rows
they
stared
at
his
lips
in
breathless
suspense
what
was
he
to
say
to
them
it
went
against
him
to
reel
off
compliantly
the
usual
patriotic
phrases
that
forced
themselves
on
one
lips
as
though
dictated
by
an
outside
power
for
months
he
had
carried
about
the
defiant
resolve
not
to
utter
the
prescribed
et
decorum
est
pro
patria
whatever
the
refusal
might
cost
nothing
was
so
repulsive
to
him
as
singing
the
praises
of
the
sacrifice
of
one
life
it
was
a
juggler
trick
to
cry
out
that
some
one
was
dying
while
inside
the
booth
murder
was
being
done
he
clenched
his
teeth
and
lowered
his
eyes
shyly
before
the
wall
of
pallid
faces
the
foolish
childlike
prayer
take
care
of
us
gazed
at
him
maddeningly
from
all
those
eyes
it
drove
him
to
sheer
despair
if
only
he
could
have
driven
them
back
to
their
own
people
and
gone
ahead
alone
with
a
jerk
he
threw
out
his
chest
fixed
his
eyes
on
a
medal
that
a
man
in
the
middle
of
the
long
row
was
wearing
and
said
boys
we
going
to
meet
the
enemy
now
i
count
upon
each
of
you
to
do
his
duty
faithful
to
the
oath
you
have
sworn
to
the
flag
i
shall
ask
nothing
of
you
that
the
interest
of
our
fatherland
and
your
own
interest
therefore
and
the
safety
of
your
wives
and
children
do
not
absolutely
require
you
may
depend
upon
that
good
luck
and
now
forward
march
without
being
conscious
of
it
he
had
imitated
weixler
voice
his
unnaturally
loud
studiedly
incisive
tone
of
command
so
as
to
drown
the
emotion
that
fluttered
in
his
throat
at
the
last
words
he
faced
about
abruptly
and
without
looking
around
tossed
the
final
command
over
his
shoulder
for
the
men
to
deploy
and
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
chest
he
began
the
ascent
taking
long
strides
behind
him
boots
crunched
and
food
pails
clattered
against
some
other
part
of
the
men
accouterment
soon
too
there
came
the
sound
of
the
gasping
of
heavily
laden
men
and
a
thick
suffocating
smell
of
sweat
settled
upon
the
marching
company
captain
marschner
was
ashamed
a
real
physical
nausea
at
the
part
he
had
just
played
overcame
him
what
was
there
left
for
these
simple
people
to
do
these
bricklayers
and
engineers
and
cultivators
of
the
earth
who
bent
over
their
daily
tasks
had
lived
without
vision
into
the
future
what
was
there
left
for
them
to
do
when
the
grand
folks
the
learned
people
their
own
captain
with
the
three
golden
stars
on
his
collar
assured
them
it
was
their
duty
and
a
most
praiseworthy
thing
to
shoot
italian
bricklayers
and
engineers
and
farmers
into
fragments
they
went
gasping
behind
him
and
he
he
led
them
on
led
them
against
his
inner
conviction
because
of
his
pitiful
cowardice
and
asked
them
to
be
courageous
and
contemptuous
of
death
he
had
talked
them
into
it
had
abused
their
confidence
had
made
capital
of
their
love
for
their
wives
and
children
because
if
he
acted
in
the
service
of
a
lie
there
was
a
chance
of
his
continuing
to
live
and
even
coming
back
home
safe
again
while
if
he
stuck
to
the
truth
he
believed
in
there
was
the
certainty
of
his
being
stood
up
against
a
wall
and
shot
he
staked
their
lives
and
his
own
life
on
the
throw
of
loaded
dice
because
he
was
too
cowardly
to
contemplate
the
certain
loss
of
the
game
for
himself
alone
the
sun
beat
down
murderously
on
the
steep
treeless
declivity
the
sound
of
shells
bursting
off
at
a
distance
of
tattooing
machine
guns
and
roaring
artillery
on
their
own
side
was
now
mingled
with
the
howling
sound
of
shots
whizzing
through
the
air
and
coming
closer
and
closer
and
still
the
top
of
the
ridge
had
not
been
reached
the
captain
felt
his
breath
fail
him
stopped
and
raised
his
hand
the
men
were
to
get
their
wind
back
for
a
moment
they
had
been
on
the
march
since
four
that
morning
they
had
done
bravely
with
their
legs
he
could
tell
that
by
his
own
full
of
compassion
he
looked
upon
the
bluish
red
faces
streaming
with
sweat
and
gave
a
start
when
he
saw
lieutenant
weixler
approaching
in
long
strides
why
could
he
no
longer
see
that
face
without
a
sense
of
being
attacked
of
being
caught
at
the
throat
by
a
hatred
he
could
hardly
control
he
ought
really
to
be
glad
to
have
the
man
at
his
side
there
one
glance
into
those
coldly
watchful
eyes
was
sufficient
to
subdue
any
surge
of
compassion
with
your
permission
captain
he
heard
him
rasp
out
i
going
over
to
the
left
wing
a
couple
of
fellows
there
that
do
please
me
at
all
especially
simmel
the
dog
he
already
pulling
his
head
in
when
a
shrapnel
bursts
over
there
marschner
was
silent
the
dog
simmel
was
that
the
endman
in
the
second
line
the
and
upholsterer
who
had
carried
that
exquisite
little
girl
in
his
arms
up
to
the
last
moment
until
weixler
had
brutally
driven
him
off
to
the
train
it
seemed
to
the
captain
as
though
he
could
still
see
the
astonished
upward
look
at
the
mighty
man
who
could
scold
their
own
father
let
him
be
he
get
used
to
it
by
and
by
he
said
mildly
he
got
his
children
on
his
mind
and
is
in
a
hurry
to
make
orphans
of
them
the
men
ca
all
be
heroes
if
they
just
do
their
duty
weixler
face
became
rigid
his
narrow
lips
tightened
again
into
that
hard
contemptuous
expression
which
the
captain
felt
each
time
like
the
blow
of
a
whip
he
not
supposed
to
think
of
his
brats
now
but
of
his
oath
to
the
flag
of
the
oath
he
swore
to
his
majesty
his
you
just
told
them
so
yourself
captain
yes
yes
i
know
i
did
captain
marschner
nodded
and
let
himself
slide
down
slowly
on
the
grass
it
was
not
surprising
that
this
boy
spoke
as
he
did
but
what
was
surprising
was
that
years
ago
when
he
himself
had
come
from
the
military
academy
all
aglow
with
enthusiasm
the
phrases
oath
to
the
flag
his
majesty
and
had
seemed
to
him
too
to
be
the
sum
and
substance
of
all
things
in
those
days
he
would
have
been
like
this
lad
and
would
have
gone
to
war
full
of
joyous
enthusiasm
but
now
that
he
had
grown
deaf
to
the
fanfaronade
of
such
words
and
clearly
saw
the
framework
on
which
they
were
constructed
how
was
he
to
keep
pace
with
the
young
who
were
a
credulous
echo
of
every
speech
they
heard
how
was
he
suddenly
to
make
bold
reckless
blades
of
his
excellent
comfortable
philistines
whom
life
had
so
thoroughly
tamed
that
at
home
they
were
capable
of
going
hungry
and
not
snatching
at
treasures
that
were
separated
from
them
by
only
a
thin
partition
of
glass
what
was
the
use
of
making
the
same
demands
upon
the
upholsterer
simmel
as
upon
the
young
lieutenant
who
had
never
striven
for
anything
else
than
to
be
named
first
for
fencing
wrestling
and
courageous
conduct
have
mercenaries
ever
been
famous
for
their
morals
or
good
solid
citizens
for
their
fearlessness
can
one
and
the
same
man
be
twenty
and
years
old
at
the
same
time
crouching
there
his
head
between
his
fists
the
captain
became
so
absorbed
in
these
thoughts
that
he
lost
all
sense
of
the
time
and
the
place
and
the
lieutenant
attempts
to
rouse
him
by
passing
by
several
times
and
hustling
the
men
about
loudly
remained
unsuccessful
but
at
last
the
sound
of
a
horse
hoofs
brought
him
back
to
consciousness
an
officer
was
galloping
along
the
path
that
ran
about
the
hill
half
way
from
the
top
on
his
head
he
wore
the
tall
cap
that
marked
him
as
a
member
of
the
general
staff
he
reined
in
his
horse
asked
courteously
where
the
company
was
bound
and
raised
his
eyebrows
when
captain
marschner
explained
the
precise
position
they
were
to
take
so
that
where
you
going
he
exclaimed
and
his
grimace
turned
into
a
respectful
smile
well
i
congratulate
you
you
going
into
the
very
thickest
of
the
lousy
mess
for
three
days
the
italians
have
been
trying
to
break
through
at
that
point
i
would
hold
you
back
for
a
moment
the
poor
devils
there
now
will
make
good
use
of
the
relief
and
good
luck
gracefully
he
touched
the
edge
of
his
cap
his
horse
cried
out
under
the
pressure
of
his
spurs
and
he
was
gone
the
captain
stared
after
him
as
though
dazed
well
i
congratulate
you
the
words
echoed
in
his
ears
a
man
well
mounted
thoroughly
rested
pink
and
neat
as
though
he
had
just
come
out
of
a
meets
two
hundred
fellowmen
dedicated
to
death
sees
them
sweaty
breathless
on
the
very
edge
of
destruction
knows
that
in
another
hour
many
a
face
now
turned
upon
him
curiously
will
lie
in
the
grass
distorted
by
pain
or
rigid
in
death
and
he
says
smiling
well
i
congratulate
you
and
he
rides
on
and
no
shudder
of
awe
creeps
down
his
back
no
shadow
touches
his
forehead
the
meeting
will
fade
from
the
man
memory
without
leaving
a
trace
at
dinner
that
night
nothing
will
remind
him
of
the
comrade
whose
hand
perhaps
he
was
the
last
one
to
press
to
these
chosen
ones
who
from
their
safe
positions
in
the
rear
drive
the
columns
on
into
the
fire
what
matters
a
single
company
march
to
death
and
the
miserable
upholsterer
here
was
trembling
pulling
back
his
head
tearing
his
eyes
open
mightily
as
though
the
fate
of
the
world
depended
upon
whether
he
would
ever
again
carry
his
little
girl
in
his
arms
to
be
sure
if
one
viewed
the
whole
matter
in
the
proper
perspective
as
a
member
of
the
general
staff
riding
by
who
kept
his
vision
fixed
on
the
aim
that
is
the
victory
that
sooner
or
later
would
be
celebrated
to
the
clinking
of
glasses
why
from
that
point
of
view
weixler
was
right
it
must
make
him
indignant
to
have
events
of
such
epic
grandeur
made
ridiculous
by
such
a
creature
as
simmel
and
degraded
into
a
doleful
family
affair
the
poor
devils
there
now
a
cold
shiver
ran
down
marschner
back
the
staff
officer
words
suddenly
evoked
a
vision
of
the
shattered
trench
where
the
men
exhausted
to
the
point
of
death
were
yearning
for
him
as
for
a
redeemer
he
arose
with
a
groan
seized
by
a
grim
embittered
hatred
against
this
age
not
a
single
mesh
in
the
net
left
open
every
minute
of
respite
granted
his
own
men
was
theft
or
even
murder
committed
against
the
men
out
there
he
threw
up
his
arms
and
strode
forward
determined
to
rest
no
more
until
he
reached
the
trench
that
he
and
his
company
were
to
man
and
hold
his
face
was
pale
and
careworn
and
each
time
he
caught
the
exasperating
rasp
of
his
lieutenant
voice
from
the
other
wing
crying
forward
forward
it
was
drawn
by
a
tortured
smile
suddenly
he
stood
still
into
the
rattle
the
boom
the
explosion
of
artillery
there
leaped
suddenly
a
new
tone
it
rose
clearly
above
the
rest
of
the
din
which
had
almost
ceased
to
penetrate
the
consciousness
it
approached
with
such
a
shrill
sound
with
such
indescribable
swiftness
with
so
fierce
a
threat
that
the
sound
seemed
to
be
visible
as
though
you
could
actually
see
a
screaming
semicircle
rise
in
the
air
bite
its
way
to
one
very
forehead
and
snap
there
with
a
short
hard
whiplike
crack
a
few
feet
away
a
little
whirl
of
dust
was
puffed
up
and
invisible
hail
stones
slapped
rattling
down
upon
the
grass
a
shrapnel
captain
marschner
looked
round
startled
and
to
his
terror
saw
all
the
men
eyes
fixed
on
him
as
though
asking
his
advice
a
peculiar
smile
of
shame
and
embarrassment
hovered
about
their
lips
it
was
his
business
to
set
the
men
a
good
example
to
march
on
carelessly
without
stopping
or
looking
up
after
all
it
made
no
difference
what
one
did
one
way
or
the
other
there
was
no
possibility
of
running
away
or
hiding
it
was
all
a
matter
of
chance
chance
was
the
one
thing
that
would
protect
a
man
so
the
thing
to
do
was
to
go
ahead
as
if
not
noticing
anything
if
there
was
only
one
man
in
the
company
who
did
not
seem
to
care
the
others
would
be
put
to
shame
and
would
mutually
control
each
other
and
then
everything
was
won
he
could
tell
by
his
own
experience
how
the
feeling
of
being
watched
on
all
sides
upheld
him
had
he
been
by
himself
he
might
have
thrown
himself
on
the
ground
and
tried
to
hide
behind
a
stone
no
matter
how
small
nothing
but
a
spent
shot
forward
boys
he
cried
the
thought
of
being
a
support
to
his
men
almost
making
him
cheerful
but
the
words
were
not
out
of
his
mouth
when
other
shots
whizzed
through
the
air
in
spite
of
himself
his
body
twitched
backward
and
his
head
sank
lower
between
his
shoulders
that
made
him
stiffen
his
muscles
and
grind
his
teeth
in
rage
it
was
not
the
violence
with
which
the
scream
flew
toward
him
that
made
him
twitch
it
was
the
strange
precision
with
which
the
circle
of
the
thing
flight
exactly
like
a
diagram
at
a
lecture
on
artillery
curved
in
front
of
him
it
was
this
unnatural
feeling
of
perceiving
a
sound
more
with
the
eye
than
with
the
ear
that
made
the
will
powerless
something
had
to
be
done
to
create
the
illusion
of
not
being
wholly
defenseless
forward
run
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
holding
his
hands
to
his
mouth
to
make
a
megaphone
his
men
stormed
forward
as
if
relieved
the
tension
left
their
faces
each
one
was
somehow
busied
with
himself
stumbled
picked
himself
up
grasped
some
piece
of
equipment
that
was
coming
loose
and
in
the
general
snorting
and
gasping
the
whistle
of
the
approaching
shells
passed
almost
unobserved
after
a
while
it
came
to
captain
marschner
consciousness
that
some
one
was
hissing
into
his
left
ear
he
turned
his
head
and
saw
weixler
running
beside
him
scarlet
in
the
face
what
is
it
he
asked
involuntarily
slowing
down
from
a
run
to
a
walk
captain
i
beg
to
announce
that
an
example
ought
to
be
instituted
that
coward
simmel
is
demoralizing
the
whole
company
at
each
shrapnel
he
yells
out
my
savior
and
flings
himself
to
the
ground
he
is
frightening
the
rest
of
the
men
he
ought
to
be
made
an
example
of
a
a
charge
of
four
shrapnels
whizzed
into
the
middle
of
his
sentence
the
screaming
seemed
to
have
grown
louder
more
piercing
the
captain
felt
as
though
a
monstrous
glittering
scythe
were
flashing
in
a
steep
curve
directly
down
on
his
skull
but
this
time
he
did
not
dare
to
move
an
eyelash
his
limbs
contracted
and
grew
taut
as
in
the
dentist
chair
when
the
forceps
grip
the
tooth
at
the
same
time
he
examined
the
lieutenant
face
closely
curious
to
see
how
he
was
taking
the
fire
for
which
he
had
so
yearned
but
he
seemed
not
to
be
noticing
the
shrapnels
in
the
least
he
was
stretching
his
neck
to
inspect
the
left
wing
there
he
cried
indignantly
see
captain
the
miserable
cur
is
down
on
his
face
again
i
go
for
him
before
marschner
could
hold
him
back
he
had
dashed
off
but
he
stopped
stood
still
and
then
turned
back
in
annoyance
the
fellow
hit
he
announced
glumly
with
an
irritated
shrug
of
his
shoulders
hit
the
captain
burst
out
and
an
ugly
bitter
taste
suddenly
made
his
tongue
cleave
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
he
observed
the
frosty
calm
in
weixler
features
the
unsympathetic
indifferent
look
and
his
hand
started
upward
he
could
have
slapped
him
his
insensibility
was
so
maddening
and
that
careless
the
fellow
hit
hurt
so
the
image
of
the
dear
little
girl
with
the
bright
ribbon
in
her
red
curls
flashed
into
his
mind
and
also
the
vision
of
a
distorted
corpse
holding
a
child
in
its
arms
as
through
a
veil
he
saw
weixler
hasten
past
him
to
catch
up
with
the
company
and
he
ran
to
where
the
two
kneeled
next
to
something
invisible
the
wounded
man
lay
on
his
back
his
flaming
red
hair
framed
a
greenish
grey
face
ghostly
in
its
rigidity
a
few
minutes
before
captain
marschner
had
seen
the
man
still
running
the
same
face
still
full
of
vitality
from
heat
and
excitement
his
knees
gave
way
the
sight
of
that
change
so
incomprehensible
in
its
suddenness
gripped
at
his
vitals
like
an
icy
hand
was
it
possible
could
all
the
life
blood
recede
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
a
strong
hale
man
crumble
into
ruins
in
a
few
moments
what
powers
of
hell
slept
in
such
pieces
of
iron
that
between
two
breaths
they
could
perform
the
work
of
many
months
of
illness
do
be
frightened
simmel
the
captain
stammered
supporting
himself
on
the
shoulder
of
one
of
the
they
carry
you
back
to
the
baggage
he
forced
the
lie
out
with
an
effort
drawing
a
deep
breath
you
be
the
first
one
to
get
back
to
vienna
now
he
wanted
to
add
something
about
the
man
family
and
the
little
girl
with
the
red
curls
but
he
could
not
get
it
over
his
lips
he
dreaded
a
cry
from
the
dying
man
for
his
dear
ones
and
when
the
mouth
writhing
with
pain
opened
slowly
it
sent
an
inner
tremor
through
the
captain
he
saw
the
eyes
open
too
and
he
shuddered
at
their
glassy
stare
which
seemed
no
longer
to
fix
itself
upon
any
bodily
thing
but
to
be
looking
through
all
those
present
and
seeking
something
at
a
distance
simmers
body
writhed
under
the
forcible
examination
of
the
hands
incomprehensible
gurgling
sounds
arose
from
his
torn
chest
streaming
with
blood
and
his
breath
blew
the
scarlet
foam
at
his
mouth
into
bursting
bubbles
simmel
what
do
you
want
simmel
marschner
besought
bending
low
over
the
wounded
man
he
listened
intently
to
the
broken
sounds
convinced
that
he
would
have
to
try
to
catch
a
last
message
he
breathed
in
relief
when
the
wandering
eyes
at
last
found
their
way
back
and
fastened
themselves
on
his
face
with
a
look
of
anxious
inquiry
in
them
simmel
he
cried
again
and
grasped
his
hand
which
trembled
toward
the
wound
simmel
do
you
know
me
simmel
nodded
his
eyes
widened
the
corners
of
his
mouth
drooped
it
hurts
captain
hurts
so
came
from
the
shattered
breast
to
the
captain
it
sounded
like
a
reproach
after
a
short
rattling
sound
of
pain
he
cried
out
again
foaming
at
the
mouth
and
with
a
piercing
shriek
of
rage
it
hurts
it
hurts
he
beat
about
with
his
hands
and
feet
captain
marschner
jumped
up
carry
him
back
he
commanded
and
without
knowing
what
he
did
he
put
his
fingers
into
his
ears
and
ran
after
the
company
which
had
already
reached
the
top
of
the
ridge
he
ran
pressing
his
head
between
his
hands
as
in
a
vise
reeling
panting
driven
by
a
fear
as
though
the
wounded
man
agonized
cry
were
pursuing
him
with
lifted
axe
he
saw
the
shrunken
body
writhe
the
face
that
had
so
suddenly
withered
the
yellowish
white
of
the
eyes
and
that
cry
captain
hurts
so
echoed
within
him
and
clawed
at
his
breast
so
that
when
he
reached
the
summit
he
fell
down
half
choked
as
if
the
ground
had
been
dragged
from
under
his
feet
no
he
could
do
that
sort
of
thing
he
did
want
to
go
on
with
it
he
was
no
hangman
he
was
incapable
of
lashing
men
on
to
their
death
he
could
not
be
deaf
to
their
woe
to
that
childlike
whimpering
which
stung
his
conscience
like
a
bitter
reproach
he
stamped
on
the
ground
defiantly
everything
in
him
arose
in
rebellion
against
the
task
that
called
him
below
the
field
of
battle
stretched
far
out
cheerlessly
grey
no
tree
no
patch
of
green
a
stony
waste
chopped
up
crushed
dug
inside
out
no
sign
of
life
the
communication
trenches
which
started
in
the
bottom
of
the
valley
and
led
to
the
edge
of
the
hill
from
which
the
wire
entanglements
projected
looked
like
fingers
spread
out
to
grasp
something
and
clawed
deep
into
the
throttled
earth
marschner
looked
round
again
involuntarily
behind
him
the
green
slope
descended
steeply
to
the
little
woods
in
which
the
baggage
had
been
left
farther
behind
the
white
highroad
gleamed
like
a
river
framed
in
colored
meadows
a
short
turn
and
the
greenness
vanished
all
life
succumbed
as
though
roared
down
by
the
cannons
by
the
howling
and
pounding
that
hammered
in
the
valley
like
the
pulsating
of
a
colossal
fever
shell
hole
upon
shell
hole
yawned
down
there
from
time
to
time
thick
black
pillars
of
earth
leaped
up
and
for
moments
hid
small
parts
of
this
desert
burned
to
ashes
where
the
cloven
stumps
of
trees
whittled
as
by
stuck
up
like
a
jeering
challenge
to
the
impotent
imagination
a
challenge
to
recognize
in
this
field
of
death
and
refuse
the
landscape
it
once
had
been
before
the
great
madness
had
swept
over
it
and
sown
it
with
ruins
leaving
it
like
a
dancing
floor
on
which
two
worlds
had
fought
for
a
loose
woman
and
into
this
vale
of
hell
he
was
now
to
descend
down
there
five
days
and
five
nights
he
and
his
little
company
of
the
damned
spewed
down
into
that
place
their
living
bodies
speared
on
the
fishing
hook
bait
for
the
enemy
all
alone
with
no
one
near
to
hear
him
amid
the
fury
of
the
bursting
shrapnel
which
fell
up
there
as
thick
as
rain
in
a
thunderstorm
captain
marschner
gave
himself
up
to
his
rage
his
impotent
rage
against
a
world
that
had
inflicted
such
a
thing
on
him
he
cursed
and
roared
out
his
hatred
into
the
deaf
tumult
and
then
he
sprang
up
when
far
below
almost
in
the
valley
already
his
men
emerged
followed
by
lieutenant
weixler
who
ran
behind
them
like
a
butcher
helper
driving
oxen
to
the
shambles
the
captain
saw
them
hurry
saw
the
clouds
of
the
explosions
multiply
above
their
heads
and
on
the
slope
in
front
of
him
saw
heaps
scattered
here
and
there
like
knapsacks
dropped
by
the
way
some
motionless
some
twitching
like
great
spiders
and
he
rushed
on
he
raced
like
a
madman
down
the
steep
slope
scarcely
feeling
the
ground
under
his
feet
nor
hearing
the
rattle
of
the
exploding
shells
he
flew
rather
than
ran
stumbled
over
charred
roots
fell
picked
himself
up
again
and
darted
onward
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
almost
with
closed
eyes
now
and
then
as
from
a
train
window
he
saw
a
pale
troubled
face
flit
by
once
it
seemed
to
him
he
heard
a
man
moaning
for
water
but
he
wished
to
hear
nothing
to
see
nothing
he
ran
on
blind
and
deaf
without
stopping
driven
by
the
terror
of
that
bad
reproachful
hurts
so
only
once
did
he
halt
as
though
he
had
stepped
into
a
trap
and
were
held
fast
in
an
iron
vise
a
hand
stopped
him
a
grey
convulsed
hand
with
crooked
fingers
it
stuck
up
in
front
of
him
as
though
hewn
out
of
stone
he
saw
no
face
nor
knew
who
it
was
that
held
out
that
dead
threatening
fist
all
he
knew
was
that
two
hours
before
over
there
in
the
little
piece
of
woods
that
hand
had
still
comfortably
cut
slices
of
rye
bread
or
had
written
a
last
home
and
a
horror
of
those
fingers
took
hold
of
the
captain
and
lent
new
strength
to
his
limbs
so
that
he
stormed
onward
in
great
leaps
like
a
boy
until
with
throbbing
sides
and
a
red
cloud
before
his
eyes
he
caught
up
with
his
company
at
last
way
down
in
the
valley
at
the
entrance
to
the
communication
trenches
lieutenant
weixler
presented
himself
in
strictest
military
form
and
announced
the
loss
of
fourteen
men
marschner
heard
the
ring
of
pride
in
his
voice
like
triumph
over
what
had
been
achieved
like
the
rejoicing
of
a
boy
bragging
of
the
first
down
on
his
lip
and
deepening
the
newly
acquired
dignity
of
a
bass
voice
what
were
the
wounded
men
writhing
on
the
slope
above
to
this
raw
youth
what
the
coward
with
his
whine
what
the
children
robbed
of
their
provider
growing
up
to
be
beggars
to
a
life
in
the
abyss
perhaps
to
a
life
in
jail
all
these
were
mere
supers
a
stage
background
for
lieutenant
weixler
heroism
to
stand
out
in
relief
fourteen
bloody
bodies
lined
the
path
he
had
trodden
without
fear
how
should
his
eyes
not
radiate
arrogance
the
captain
hastened
on
past
weixler
if
only
he
did
not
have
to
see
him
he
told
himself
if
only
he
did
not
have
to
meet
the
contented
gleam
of
the
man
eyes
he
feared
his
rage
might
master
his
reason
and
his
tongue
get
beyond
his
control
and
his
clenched
fist
do
its
own
will
but
here
he
had
to
spare
this
man
here
lieutenant
weixler
was
within
his
rights
he
grew
from
moment
to
moment
his
stature
dwarfed
the
others
he
swam
upon
the
stream
while
the
others
weighed
down
by
the
burden
of
their
riper
humanity
sank
like
heavy
clods
here
other
laws
obtained
the
dark
shaft
in
which
they
now
reeled
forward
with
trembling
knees
led
to
an
island
washed
by
a
sea
of
death
whoever
was
stranded
there
dared
not
keep
anything
that
he
used
in
another
world
the
man
who
was
master
here
was
the
one
who
had
kept
nothing
but
his
axe
and
his
fist
and
he
was
the
rich
one
upon
whose
superabundance
the
others
depended
as
captain
marschner
groped
his
way
through
the
slippery
trench
in
a
daze
it
became
clearer
and
clearer
to
him
that
he
must
now
hold
on
to
his
detested
lieutenant
like
a
treasure
without
him
he
would
be
lost
he
saw
the
traces
of
puddles
of
blood
at
his
feet
and
trod
upon
tattered
pieces
of
uniforms
on
empty
shells
rattling
preserve
tins
fragments
of
cannon
balls
yawning
shell
holes
would
open
up
suddenly
precariously
bridged
with
boards
everywhere
the
traces
of
frenzied
devastation
grinned
blackened
remains
of
a
wilderness
of
wires
beams
sacks
broken
tools
a
disorder
that
took
one
breath
away
and
made
one
dizzy
all
steeped
in
the
suffocating
stench
of
combustion
powder
smoke
and
the
pungent
stinging
breath
of
the
ecrasite
shells
wherever
one
stepped
the
earth
had
been
lacerated
by
gigantic
explosions
laboriously
patched
up
again
once
more
ripped
open
to
its
very
bowels
and
leveled
a
second
time
so
that
one
reeled
on
unconscious
as
if
in
a
hurricane
crushed
by
the
weight
of
his
impressions
captain
marschner
crept
through
the
trench
like
a
worm
and
his
thoughts
turned
ever
more
passionately
ever
more
desperately
to
lieutenant
weixler
weixler
alone
could
help
him
or
take
his
place
with
that
grim
cold
energy
of
his
with
that
blindness
to
everything
which
did
not
touch
his
own
life
or
which
was
eclipsed
by
the
glowing
vision
of
an
erich
weixler
studded
with
decorations
and
promoted
out
of
his
turn
the
captain
kept
looking
about
for
him
anxiously
and
breathed
with
relief
each
time
the
urgent
rasping
voice
came
to
his
ears
from
the
rear
the
trench
seemed
never
to
be
coming
to
an
end
marschner
felt
his
strength
giving
way
he
stumbled
more
frequently
and
closed
his
eyes
with
a
shudder
at
the
traces
of
blood
that
precisely
indicated
the
path
of
the
wounded
suddenly
he
raised
his
head
with
a
jerk
a
new
smell
struck
him
a
sweetish
stench
which
kept
getting
stronger
and
stronger
until
at
a
curve
of
the
trench
wall
which
swung
off
to
the
left
at
this
point
and
receded
semicircularly
it
burst
upon
him
like
a
great
cloud
he
looked
about
shaken
by
nausea
his
gorge
rising
in
a
dip
in
the
trench
he
saw
a
pile
of
dirty
tattered
uniforms
heaped
in
layers
and
with
strangely
rigid
outlines
it
took
him
some
time
to
grasp
the
full
horror
of
that
which
towered
in
front
of
him
fallen
soldiers
were
lying
there
like
gathered
logs
in
the
contorted
shapes
of
the
last
death
agony
tent
flaps
had
been
spread
over
them
but
had
slipped
down
and
revealed
the
grim
stony
grey
caricatures
the
fallen
jaws
the
staring
eyes
the
arms
of
those
in
the
top
tier
hung
earthward
like
parts
of
a
trellis
and
grasped
at
the
faces
of
those
lying
below
and
were
already
sown
with
the
livid
splotches
of
corruption
captain
marschner
uttered
a
short
belching
cry
and
reeled
forward
his
head
shook
as
though
loosened
from
his
neck
and
his
knees
gave
way
so
that
he
already
saw
the
ground
rising
up
toward
him
when
suddenly
an
unknown
face
emerged
directly
in
front
of
him
and
attracted
his
attention
and
gave
him
back
his
it
was
a
sergeant
who
was
staring
at
him
silently
with
great
fevered
gleaming
eyes
in
a
deathly
pale
face
for
a
moment
the
man
stood
as
though
paralyzed
then
his
mouth
opened
wide
he
clapped
his
hands
and
jumped
into
the
air
like
a
dancer
and
dashed
off
without
thinking
of
a
salute
relief
he
shouted
while
running
he
came
to
a
halt
before
a
black
hole
in
the
trench
wall
like
the
entrance
to
a
cave
and
bent
down
and
shouted
into
the
opening
with
a
ring
of
indescribable
joy
in
his
voice
with
a
rejoicing
that
sounded
as
if
it
came
through
tears
relief
lieutenant
the
relief
party
is
here
the
captain
looked
after
him
and
heard
his
cry
his
eyes
grew
moist
so
touching
was
that
childlike
cry
of
joy
that
shout
from
out
of
a
relieved
heart
he
followed
the
sergeant
slowly
and
saw
as
though
the
cry
had
awakened
the
dead
pallid
faces
peering
from
all
corners
wounded
men
with
bandages
tottering
figures
holding
their
rifles
men
streamed
toward
him
from
every
direction
stared
at
him
and
with
speechless
lips
formed
the
word
relief
until
at
length
one
of
them
roared
out
a
piercing
hurrah
which
spread
like
wildfire
and
found
an
echo
in
unseen
throats
that
repeated
it
enthusiastically
deeply
shaken
marschner
bowed
his
head
and
swiftly
drew
his
hand
across
his
eyes
when
the
commandant
of
the
trench
rushed
toward
him
from
the
dugout
nothing
that
betokens
life
was
left
about
the
man
his
face
was
ashen
his
eyes
like
lamps
extinguished
glazed
and
surrounded
by
broad
blue
rims
his
lids
were
a
vivid
red
from
sleeplessness
his
hair
his
beard
his
clothes
were
encased
in
a
thick
crust
of
mud
so
that
he
looked
as
if
he
had
just
arisen
from
the
grave
he
gave
a
brief
military
salute
then
grasped
the
captain
hand
with
hysterical
joy
his
hand
was
cold
as
a
corpse
and
sticky
with
sweat
and
dirt
and
most
uncanny
was
the
contrast
between
this
skeleton
hung
with
clothes
this
rigid
of
a
face
and
the
twitching
nervousness
with
which
the
lieutenant
greeted
their
liberator
the
words
leaped
like
a
waterfall
from
his
cracked
lips
he
drew
marschner
into
the
dugout
and
pushed
him
stumbling
and
groping
as
if
dazzled
down
on
an
invisible
something
meant
for
a
seat
and
began
to
tell
his
tale
he
could
stand
still
for
a
second
he
hopped
about
slapped
his
thighs
laughed
with
unnatural
loudness
ran
up
and
down
trippingly
threw
himself
on
the
couch
in
the
corner
asked
for
a
cigarette
every
other
minute
threw
it
away
without
knowing
it
after
two
puffs
and
at
once
asked
for
another
i
tell
you
three
hours
more
he
crowed
blissfully
with
affected
gaiety
three
what
am
i
talking
about
hour
more
and
it
would
have
been
too
late
know
how
many
rounds
of
ammunition
i
got
left
eleven
hundred
in
all
machine
guns
run
down
telephone
smashed
since
last
night
already
send
out
a
party
to
repair
it
impossible
needed
every
man
in
the
trench
a
hundred
and
of
us
at
first
now
i
got
eleven
of
them
wounded
so
that
they
ca
hold
a
rifle
fellows
to
hold
the
trench
with
last
night
there
were
still
of
us
when
they
attacked
we
drove
to
hell
of
course
but
fourteen
of
our
men
went
again
we
have
had
a
chance
to
bury
them
yet
did
you
see
them
lying
out
there
the
captain
let
him
talk
he
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
primitive
table
held
his
head
between
his
hands
and
kept
silent
his
eyes
wandered
about
the
dark
mouldy
den
filled
with
the
stench
of
a
smoking
little
kerosene
lamp
he
saw
the
mildewed
straw
in
the
corner
the
disconnected
telephone
at
the
entrance
an
empty
box
of
tinned
food
on
which
a
crumpled
map
was
spread
out
he
saw
a
mountain
of
rifles
bundles
of
uniforms
each
one
ticketed
and
he
felt
how
inch
by
inch
a
dumb
icy
horror
arose
within
him
and
paralyzed
his
breathing
as
though
the
earth
overhead
upheld
by
only
a
thin
scaffolding
of
cracked
boards
and
threatening
to
fall
at
any
moment
had
already
laid
its
intolerable
weight
upon
his
chest
and
that
prancing
ghost
that
giggling
head
which
only
a
week
before
perhaps
had
still
been
young
affected
him
like
a
nightmare
and
the
thought
that
now
his
turn
had
come
to
stick
it
out
in
that
sepulchral
vault
for
five
or
six
days
or
a
week
and
experience
the
same
horrors
that
the
man
there
was
telling
about
with
a
laugh
intensified
his
discouragement
into
a
passionate
throbbing
indignation
which
he
could
scarcely
control
any
more
he
could
have
roared
out
could
have
jumped
up
run
out
and
shouted
to
mankind
from
the
depths
of
his
soul
asking
why
he
had
been
tossed
there
why
he
would
have
to
lie
there
until
he
had
turned
into
carrion
or
a
crazy
man
how
could
he
have
let
himself
be
driven
out
there
he
could
not
understand
it
he
saw
no
meaning
to
it
all
no
aim
all
he
saw
was
that
hole
in
the
earth
those
rotting
corpses
outside
and
nearby
but
one
step
removed
from
all
that
madness
his
own
vienna
as
he
had
left
it
only
two
days
before
with
its
tramways
its
show
windows
its
smiling
people
and
its
lighted
theaters
what
madness
to
be
crouching
there
waiting
for
death
with
idiotic
patience
to
perish
on
the
naked
earth
in
blood
and
filth
like
a
beast
while
other
people
happy
clean
dressed
up
sat
in
bright
halls
and
listened
to
music
and
then
nestled
in
soft
beds
without
fear
without
danger
guarded
by
a
whole
world
which
would
come
down
in
indignation
upon
any
who
dared
to
harm
a
single
hair
of
their
heads
had
madness
already
stolen
upon
him
or
were
the
others
mad
his
pulse
raged
as
though
his
heart
would
burst
if
he
could
not
relieve
his
soul
by
a
loud
shout
at
that
very
moment
lieutenant
weixler
came
bustling
in
like
the
master
of
ceremonies
at
a
ball
he
stood
stiff
and
straight
in
front
of
the
captain
and
announced
that
everything
above
was
in
readiness
that
he
had
already
assigned
the
posts
and
arranged
the
watches
and
placed
the
machine
guns
the
captain
looked
at
him
and
had
to
lower
his
eyes
as
if
boxed
on
the
ears
by
this
tranquillity
which
would
suddenly
wither
his
fury
into
a
burning
shame
at
himself
why
did
that
man
remain
untouched
by
the
great
fear
of
death
which
impregnated
the
very
air
here
how
was
it
that
he
could
give
orders
and
commands
with
the
foresightedness
of
a
mature
man
while
he
himself
crept
out
of
sight
like
a
frightened
child
and
rebelled
against
his
fate
with
the
senseless
fury
of
an
animal
at
bay
instead
of
mastering
fate
as
befitted
his
age
was
he
a
coward
was
he
in
the
grip
of
a
mean
paltry
fear
was
he
overcome
by
that
wretched
blindness
of
the
soul
which
can
not
lift
its
vision
beyond
its
own
ego
nor
lose
sight
of
its
ego
for
the
sake
of
an
idea
was
he
really
so
devoid
of
any
sense
for
the
common
welfare
so
utterly
ruled
by
selfishness
concerned
with
nothing
but
his
bare
miserable
existence
no
he
was
not
like
that
he
clung
to
his
own
life
no
more
than
any
other
man
he
could
have
cast
it
away
enthusiastically
and
without
flying
banners
without
ecstasy
without
the
world
applause
had
the
hostile
trenches
over
there
been
filled
with
men
like
weixler
had
the
combat
been
against
such
crazy
hardness
of
soul
against
catchwords
fattened
with
human
flesh
against
that
whole
cleverly
machine
of
force
which
drove
those
whom
it
was
supposed
to
protect
to
form
a
wall
to
protect
itself
he
would
have
hurled
himself
into
the
fight
with
bare
fists
unmindful
of
the
bursting
of
shells
the
moans
of
the
wounded
oh
no
he
was
not
a
coward
not
what
those
two
men
thought
he
saw
them
wink
scornfully
and
make
fun
of
the
unhappy
old
uncle
of
a
reserve
officer
who
sat
in
the
corner
like
a
bundle
of
misery
what
did
they
know
of
his
soul
bitterness
they
stood
there
as
heroes
and
felt
the
glances
of
their
home
upon
them
and
spoke
words
which
upborne
by
the
echo
of
a
whole
world
peopled
the
loneliness
with
all
the
hosts
of
the
likeminded
and
filled
their
souls
with
the
strength
of
millions
and
they
laughed
at
a
man
who
was
to
kill
without
feeling
hatred
and
die
without
ecstasy
for
a
victory
that
was
nothing
to
him
but
a
big
force
which
achieved
its
objects
simply
because
it
hit
harder
not
because
it
had
justice
on
its
side
or
a
fine
and
noble
aim
he
had
no
cause
to
slink
off
humbled
by
their
courage
a
cold
proud
defiance
heartened
him
so
that
he
arose
strengthened
suddenly
as
if
elevated
by
the
superhuman
burden
that
he
alone
carried
on
his
shoulders
he
saw
the
strange
lieutenant
still
dancing
about
hastily
gathering
up
his
belongings
and
stuffing
them
into
his
knapsack
he
heard
him
scold
his
orderly
and
bellow
at
him
to
hurry
up
in
between
digging
up
fresh
details
hideous
episodes
from
the
combats
of
the
past
few
days
which
weixler
devoured
in
breathless
attention
what
a
question
the
commandant
of
the
trench
exclaimed
laughing
at
his
audience
whether
the
italians
had
heavy
losses
too
do
you
think
we
let
them
pepper
us
like
rabbits
you
can
easily
calculate
what
those
fellows
lost
in
their
eleven
attacks
if
we
melted
down
to
thirty
men
without
crawling
out
of
our
trench
just
let
them
go
on
like
that
a
few
weeks
longer
and
they
be
at
the
end
of
their
human
material
captain
marschner
had
not
wanted
to
listen
he
stood
bending
over
a
map
but
at
the
phrase
human
material
he
started
violently
it
sounded
like
a
taunt
directed
at
his
own
thoughts
as
if
the
two
men
had
seen
into
him
and
had
agreed
with
each
other
to
give
him
a
good
lesson
and
show
him
how
alone
he
was
human
material
in
a
trench
filled
with
the
stench
of
dead
bodies
shaken
by
the
impact
of
the
shells
stood
two
men
each
himself
a
stake
in
the
game
and
while
the
dice
were
still
being
tossed
for
their
very
bones
they
talked
of
human
material
they
uttered
those
ruthless
shameful
words
without
a
shadow
of
indignation
as
though
it
were
natural
for
their
living
bodies
to
be
no
more
than
a
gambler
chips
in
the
hands
of
men
who
arrogated
to
themselves
the
right
to
play
the
game
of
gods
without
hesitating
they
laid
their
one
irrevocable
life
at
the
feet
of
a
power
that
could
not
prove
whether
it
had
known
how
to
place
the
stakes
rightly
except
by
their
dead
bodies
and
the
men
who
were
speaking
that
way
were
officers
so
where
was
there
a
gleam
of
hope
out
there
among
the
simple
men
perhaps
the
plain
cannon
fodder
they
were
now
crouching
resignedly
in
their
places
thinking
of
home
and
each
of
them
still
feeling
himself
a
man
he
was
drawn
to
his
men
to
their
dull
silent
sadness
to
their
true
greatness
which
without
pathos
and
without
solemnity
in
everyday
clothes
as
it
were
patiently
awaited
the
hero
death
outside
the
dugout
stood
the
remnants
of
the
relieved
company
ready
for
the
march
always
two
men
abreast
with
a
dead
comrade
on
a
tent
canvas
between
them
a
long
procession
profoundly
stirring
in
its
silent
expectancy
into
which
the
hissing
and
crackling
of
shrapnel
and
the
thunder
of
grenades
fell
like
a
warning
from
above
to
those
who
still
had
their
lives
bitterly
marschner
clenched
his
fist
at
this
insatiableness
at
that
moment
the
pale
sergeant
stepped
in
front
of
the
place
where
the
dead
had
been
piled
and
frightened
marschner
out
of
his
thoughts
captain
i
beg
to
announce
that
beside
the
fourteen
dead
there
are
three
seriously
wounded
men
who
ca
walk
italians
i
have
no
bearers
left
for
them
we
leave
them
to
you
as
a
souvenir
the
trench
commandant
who
was
just
leaving
the
dugout
with
weixler
laughed
in
his
maundering
way
you
can
have
them
dug
in
at
night
up
there
among
the
communication
trenches
captain
when
it
gets
dark
the
italians
direct
their
barrage
fire
farther
back
and
give
you
a
chance
to
climb
out
to
be
sure
they
wo
lie
in
peace
there
under
the
earth
very
long
because
the
shells
rip
everything
open
right
away
again
i
had
to
have
my
poor
ensign
buried
three
times
over
already
how
did
they
get
in
here
anyhow
weixler
asked
pushing
himself
forward
did
you
have
a
fight
in
the
trench
the
other
lieutenant
shook
his
head
proudly
i
should
rather
say
not
the
gentlemen
never
got
as
far
as
that
these
three
tried
to
cut
the
wire
entanglements
night
before
last
but
our
machine
gun
man
caught
at
it
and
his
iron
spatter
spoiled
their
little
game
well
there
they
lay
of
course
right
under
our
very
noses
and
they
had
on
the
loveliest
shoes
of
bright
yellow
my
men
begrudged
those
shoes
there
he
ended
pointing
with
his
finger
at
the
feet
of
the
pale
sergeant
there
you
see
one
pair
but
we
have
to
start
now
march
sergeant
my
respects
captain
the
italians
open
their
eyes
when
they
come
over
to
finish
us
off
comfortably
and
a
hundred
and
fifty
rifles
go
off
and
two
bullet
squirters
sorry
i
ca
be
here
to
see
it
little
man
good
luck
humming
a
merry
popular
song
he
followed
his
men
without
looking
back
without
even
observing
that
marschner
accompanied
him
a
little
on
his
way
gaily
as
though
on
a
sunday
picnic
the
men
started
on
the
way
which
led
over
the
terrible
field
of
shards
and
ruins
and
the
steep
hill
what
hells
they
must
have
endured
there
in
that
mole
gallery
the
captain
remained
standing
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh
it
was
as
if
that
long
grey
column
slowly
winding
its
way
through
the
trench
were
carrying
away
the
last
hope
the
back
of
the
last
soldier
growing
smaller
and
smaller
was
the
world
the
captain
eyes
clung
greedily
to
that
back
and
measured
fearfully
the
distance
to
the
corner
of
the
trench
from
which
he
must
lose
sight
of
it
forever
there
was
still
time
to
call
out
a
greeting
and
by
running
very
fast
one
might
still
catch
up
and
hand
over
a
letter
then
the
last
medium
disappeared
the
last
possibility
of
dividing
the
world
into
two
halves
and
his
yearning
recoiled
before
the
endless
space
it
had
to
bridge
and
there
was
nothing
else
to
bridge
it
but
his
yearning
marschner
sank
into
himself
as
he
stood
deserted
in
the
empty
trench
he
felt
as
though
he
had
been
hollowed
out
and
looked
about
for
help
and
his
eyes
clung
to
the
depression
from
which
the
corpses
had
now
been
lifted
only
the
three
italians
were
lying
there
the
life
already
gone
from
them
the
one
showed
his
face
his
mouth
was
still
wide
open
as
for
a
cry
and
his
hands
dug
themselves
as
though
to
ward
off
pain
into
his
unnaturally
swollen
body
the
other
two
lay
with
their
knees
drawn
up
and
their
heads
between
their
arms
the
naked
feet
with
their
grey
convulsed
toes
stared
into
the
communication
trench
like
things
robbed
with
a
mute
accusal
there
was
a
remoteness
about
these
dead
bodies
a
loneliness
an
isolation
about
their
bared
feet
a
tangled
web
of
memories
arose
a
throng
of
fleeting
faces
glimmered
in
the
soul
gondoliers
of
venice
voluble
cabbies
a
toothless
wife
at
posilipo
two
trips
on
a
vacation
in
italy
drove
an
army
of
sorrowing
figures
through
his
mind
and
finally
another
figure
appeared
in
that
ghostly
dance
of
death
his
own
sister
sitting
in
a
concert
hall
in
vienna
listening
to
music
while
her
brother
lay
somewhere
stretched
out
on
the
ground
rigid
in
death
an
enemy
corpse
just
to
be
kicked
aside
shuddering
the
captain
hastened
back
down
the
trench
as
though
the
three
dead
men
were
pursuing
him
noiselessly
on
their
naked
soles
when
he
reached
his
own
men
at
last
he
felt
as
if
he
had
arrived
at
a
harbor
of
safety
the
shells
were
now
falling
so
thick
that
there
was
not
a
moment
pause
between
the
explosions
and
all
sounds
merged
into
a
single
equal
rolling
thunder
which
made
the
earth
tremble
like
the
hull
of
a
ship
but
there
was
a
particularly
sharp
crashing
and
splintering
from
one
shot
that
hit
the
trench
squarely
and
whirled
the
coverings
above
in
all
directions
a
few
minutes
later
two
groaning
men
dragged
down
a
corpse
leaned
it
against
the
trench
wall
and
climbed
back
to
their
posts
through
the
narrow
shaft
marschner
saw
his
sergeant
get
up
and
move
his
lips
then
a
soldier
in
the
corner
arose
and
took
up
his
rifle
and
followed
the
two
others
heavily
it
was
all
so
comfortless
so
unmercifully
businesslike
precisely
as
when
next
breaks
into
the
monotony
of
the
practising
in
the
yard
of
the
barracks
only
with
the
difference
that
a
little
group
at
once
gathered
about
the
dead
man
drawn
by
that
shy
curiosity
which
irresistibly
attracts
simple
folk
to
corpses
and
funerals
most
of
the
men
expected
the
same
of
him
he
saw
it
in
their
eyes
that
he
too
would
go
over
and
pay
a
last
tribute
of
respect
to
the
dead
but
he
did
not
want
to
he
was
absolutely
determined
not
to
learn
the
fallen
man
name
he
was
bent
upon
practising
at
last
and
remaining
indifferent
to
all
small
happenings
so
long
as
he
had
not
seen
the
dead
man
face
nor
heard
his
name
only
a
man
had
fallen
in
battle
one
of
the
many
thousands
if
he
kept
his
distance
and
did
not
bend
over
each
individual
and
did
not
let
a
definite
fate
come
to
his
notice
it
was
not
so
hard
to
remain
indifferent
stubbornly
he
walked
over
to
the
second
shaft
leading
to
the
top
and
for
the
first
time
observed
that
it
had
grown
quite
silent
up
above
there
was
no
longer
any
screaming
or
bursting
this
silence
came
upon
the
deafening
din
like
a
paralyzing
weight
and
filled
space
with
a
tense
expectancy
that
flickered
in
all
eyes
he
wanted
to
rid
himself
of
this
oppression
and
crept
through
the
crumbling
shaft
up
to
the
top
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
weixler
curved
back
he
was
holding
his
glued
to
his
eyes
under
cover
of
a
shooting
shield
the
others
were
also
standing
as
if
pasted
to
their
posts
and
there
was
something
alarming
in
the
motionlessness
of
their
shoulder
blades
all
at
once
a
twitching
ran
through
the
petrified
row
weixler
sprang
back
jostled
against
the
captain
and
cried
out
they
are
coming
then
he
stormed
to
the
shaft
and
blew
the
alarm
whistle
marschner
stared
after
him
helplessly
he
walked
with
hesitating
steps
to
the
shield
and
looked
out
upon
the
wide
field
which
curved
beyond
the
tangle
of
wires
grey
torn
like
the
bloated
form
of
a
gigantic
corpse
far
in
the
background
the
sun
was
sinking
its
great
copper
disc
already
cut
in
half
by
the
horizon
seemed
to
be
growing
out
of
the
ground
and
against
that
dazzling
background
black
silhouettes
were
dancing
like
midges
under
a
microscope
like
indians
swinging
their
tomahawks
they
were
still
mere
specks
sometimes
they
disappeared
entirely
and
then
leaped
high
and
came
nearer
their
rifles
wriggling
in
the
air
like
the
feet
of
a
polyp
gradually
their
cries
became
audible
and
swelled
louder
and
louder
like
the
far
barking
of
dogs
when
they
called
avanti
it
was
a
piercing
cry
and
when
the
call
coraggio
went
through
their
lines
it
changed
to
a
dull
thunderous
roll
the
entire
company
now
stood
up
against
the
slope
of
the
trench
their
faces
as
of
stone
restrained
pale
as
chalk
with
lipless
mouths
each
man
gun
in
position
a
single
beast
of
prey
with
a
hundred
eyes
and
arms
do
shoot
do
shoot
do
shoot
lieutenant
weixler
voice
yelled
without
pause
through
the
trench
his
command
seemed
to
lay
its
grasp
on
every
throat
and
to
hold
the
fingers
moveless
that
greedily
clasped
the
triggers
the
first
hand
grenade
flew
into
the
trench
the
captain
saw
it
coming
then
saw
a
man
loosen
from
the
mass
reel
toward
the
dugout
with
outstretched
arms
bending
over
a
veil
of
blood
covering
his
face
then
at
last
it
was
a
relief
came
the
beating
of
the
machine
guns
and
at
once
the
rifles
went
off
too
like
the
raging
of
an
angry
pack
a
cold
repulsive
greed
lay
on
all
faces
some
of
the
men
cried
out
aloud
in
their
hate
and
rage
when
new
groups
emerged
out
there
behind
the
thinning
rows
the
barrels
of
the
rifles
glowed
with
heat
and
still
the
rumbling
cries
of
coraggio
came
nearer
and
nearer
as
though
in
a
frenzy
of
insanity
the
silhouettes
hopped
about
out
there
sprang
into
the
air
fell
and
rolled
over
each
other
as
though
the
war
dance
had
only
just
reached
the
climax
of
its
paroxysm
then
captain
marschner
observed
the
man
next
to
him
let
his
rifle
sink
for
a
moment
and
with
hasty
shaking
hands
insert
the
bayonet
into
the
smoking
barrel
the
captain
felt
as
though
he
were
going
to
vomit
he
closed
his
eyes
in
dizziness
and
leaned
against
the
trench
wall
and
let
himself
glide
to
the
earth
was
he
to
to
see
that
was
he
to
see
men
being
murdered
right
alongside
of
him
he
tore
his
revolver
from
his
pocket
emptied
it
and
threw
it
away
now
he
was
defenseless
and
suddenly
he
grew
calm
and
rose
to
his
feet
elevated
by
a
wonderful
composure
ready
to
let
himself
be
butchered
by
one
of
those
panting
beasts
who
were
storming
on
chased
by
the
blind
fear
of
death
he
wanted
to
die
like
a
man
without
hatred
without
rage
with
clean
hands
a
hoarse
roar
a
frightful
dehumanized
cry
almost
beside
him
wrenched
his
thoughts
back
into
the
trench
a
broad
stream
of
light
and
fire
travelling
in
a
steep
curve
flowed
blindingly
down
beside
him
and
sprayed
over
the
shoulder
of
the
tall
tailor
of
the
first
line
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
man
entire
left
side
flared
up
in
flames
with
a
howl
of
agony
he
threw
himself
to
the
ground
writhed
and
screamed
and
leaped
to
his
feet
again
and
ran
moaning
up
and
down
like
a
living
torch
until
he
broke
down
and
twitched
and
then
lay
rigid
captain
marschner
saw
him
lying
there
and
smelt
the
odor
of
burned
flesh
and
his
eyes
involuntarily
strayed
to
his
own
hand
on
which
a
tiny
white
spot
just
under
his
thumb
reminded
him
of
the
torments
he
had
suffered
in
his
boyhood
from
a
bad
burn
at
that
moment
a
jubilant
hurrah
roared
through
the
trench
rising
from
a
hundred
relieved
throats
the
attack
had
been
repulsed
lieutenant
weixler
had
carefully
taken
aim
at
the
thrower
of
the
liquid
fire
and
hit
at
the
first
shot
the
liquid
fire
had
risen
up
like
a
fountain
from
the
falling
man
stiffening
hand
and
rained
down
on
his
own
comrades
their
decimated
lines
shrank
back
suddenly
before
the
unexpected
danger
and
they
fled
followed
by
the
furious
shots
from
all
the
rifles
the
men
fell
down
as
if
lifeless
with
slack
faces
and
lusterless
eyes
as
though
some
one
had
turned
off
the
current
that
had
fed
those
dead
creatures
with
strength
from
some
unknown
source
some
of
them
leaned
against
the
trench
wall
white
as
cheese
and
held
their
heads
over
and
vomited
from
exhaustion
marschner
also
felt
his
gorge
rising
and
groped
his
way
toward
the
dugout
he
wanted
to
go
into
his
own
place
now
and
be
alone
and
somehow
relieve
himself
of
the
despair
that
held
him
in
its
grip
hello
lieutenant
weixler
cried
unexpectedly
through
the
silence
and
bounded
over
to
the
left
where
the
machine
guns
stood
the
captain
turned
back
again
mounted
the
ladder
and
gazed
out
into
the
foreground
of
the
field
there
right
in
front
of
the
kneeled
an
italian
his
left
arm
was
hanging
down
limp
and
his
right
arm
was
raised
beseechingly
and
he
was
crawling
toward
them
slowly
a
little
farther
back
half
hidden
by
the
kneeling
man
something
kept
stirring
on
the
ground
there
three
wounded
men
were
trying
to
creep
toward
their
own
trench
pressing
close
to
the
ground
one
could
see
very
clearly
how
they
sought
cover
behind
corpses
and
now
and
then
lay
motionless
so
as
to
escape
discovery
by
the
foe
it
was
a
pitiful
sight
those
creatures
surrounded
by
death
each
moment
like
an
eternity
above
them
yet
clinging
with
tooth
and
nail
to
their
little
remnant
of
life
come
on
is
there
a
rope
somewhere
an
old
corporal
called
down
into
the
trench
i
sorry
for
the
poor
devil
of
an
italian
let
pull
him
in
the
machine
guns
interrupted
him
the
kneeling
man
beside
the
wires
listened
started
as
if
to
run
and
fell
upon
his
face
the
earth
behind
him
rose
in
dust
from
the
bullets
and
the
others
beyond
raised
themselves
like
snakes
then
all
three
gave
a
short
leap
forward
and
lay
very
still
for
a
moment
captain
marschner
stood
speechless
he
opened
his
lips
but
no
sound
came
from
his
throat
at
last
his
tongue
obeyed
him
and
he
yelled
with
a
mad
choking
fury
in
his
voice
lieutenant
weixler
yes
sir
came
back
unconcernedly
captain
marschner
ran
toward
the
lieutenant
with
clenched
fists
and
scarlet
face
did
you
fire
he
panted
breathless
the
lieutenant
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
placed
his
hands
against
the
seams
of
his
trousers
and
replied
with
perfect
formality
i
did
sir
marschner
voice
failed
him
again
for
a
moment
his
teeth
chattered
his
whole
body
trembled
as
he
stammered
are
you
ashamed
of
yourself
a
soldier
does
fire
at
helpless
wounded
men
remember
that
weixler
went
white
i
beg
to
inform
you
captain
that
the
one
who
was
near
our
trench
was
hiding
the
others
from
us
i
could
spare
him
then
with
a
sudden
explosion
of
anger
he
added
defiantly
besides
i
thought
we
had
quite
enough
hungry
mouths
at
home
as
it
is
the
captain
jumped
at
him
like
a
snapping
dog
and
stamped
his
foot
and
roared
i
not
interested
in
what
you
think
i
forbid
you
to
shoot
at
the
wounded
as
long
as
i
am
commanding
officer
here
every
wounded
man
shall
be
held
sacred
whether
he
tries
to
get
to
us
or
to
return
to
the
enemy
do
you
understand
me
the
lieutenant
drew
himself
up
haughtily
in
that
case
i
must
take
the
liberty
sir
of
begging
you
to
hand
me
that
order
in
writing
i
consider
it
my
duty
to
inflict
as
much
injury
upon
the
enemy
as
possible
a
man
that
i
let
off
may
be
cured
and
come
back
two
months
later
and
perhaps
kill
ten
of
my
comrades
for
a
moment
the
two
men
stood
still
staring
at
each
other
as
though
about
to
engage
in
mortal
combat
then
marschner
nodded
his
head
almost
imperceptibly
and
said
in
a
toneless
voice
you
shall
have
it
in
writing
he
swung
on
his
heel
and
left
colored
spheres
seemed
to
dance
before
his
eyes
and
he
had
to
summon
all
his
strength
to
keep
his
equilibrium
when
at
last
he
reached
the
dugout
he
fell
on
the
box
of
empty
tins
as
if
he
had
been
beaten
his
hatred
changed
slowly
into
a
deep
embittered
sense
of
discouragement
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
not
at
the
bar
of
his
conscience
his
conscience
told
him
that
the
deed
the
lieutenant
had
done
was
cowardly
murder
but
he
and
his
conscience
had
nothing
to
say
here
they
had
happened
to
stray
into
this
place
and
would
have
to
stay
in
the
wrong
what
was
he
to
do
if
he
gave
the
order
in
writing
he
would
afford
weixler
his
desired
opportunity
of
pushing
himself
forward
and
invite
an
investigation
of
his
own
conduct
he
begrudged
the
malicious
creature
that
triumph
perhaps
it
were
better
to
make
an
end
of
the
whole
business
by
going
to
the
brigade
staff
and
telling
the
exalted
gentlemen
there
frankly
to
their
faces
that
he
could
no
longer
be
a
witness
to
that
bloody
firing
that
he
could
not
hunt
men
like
wild
beasts
no
matter
what
uniform
they
happened
to
wear
then
at
least
this
playing
at
hide
and
seek
would
end
let
them
shoot
him
if
they
wanted
to
or
hang
him
like
a
common
felon
he
would
show
them
that
he
knew
how
to
die
he
walked
out
into
the
trench
firmly
and
ordered
a
soldier
to
summon
lieutenant
weixler
now
it
was
so
clear
within
him
and
so
calm
he
heard
the
hellish
shooting
that
the
italians
were
again
directing
at
the
trench
and
went
forward
slowly
like
a
man
out
promenading
they
throwing
heavy
mines
at
us
now
captain
the
old
corporal
announced
and
looked
at
marschner
in
despair
but
marschner
went
by
unmoved
all
that
no
longer
mattered
to
him
the
lieutenant
would
take
over
the
command
that
was
what
he
was
going
to
tell
him
he
could
hardly
await
the
moment
to
relieve
himself
of
the
responsibility
as
weixler
delayed
coming
he
crept
up
through
the
shaft
to
the
top
the
man
small
evil
eyes
flew
to
meet
him
and
sought
the
written
order
in
his
hand
the
captain
acted
as
though
he
did
not
notice
the
question
in
his
look
and
said
imperiously
lieutenant
i
turn
the
command
of
the
company
over
to
you
until
a
short
roar
of
violence
cut
short
his
speech
he
had
the
feeling
that
will
hit
me
and
that
very
instant
he
saw
something
like
a
black
whale
rush
down
in
front
of
his
eyes
from
out
of
the
heavens
and
plunge
head
foremost
into
the
trench
wall
behind
him
then
a
crater
opened
up
in
the
earth
a
sea
of
flame
that
raised
him
up
and
filled
his
lungs
with
fire
on
slowly
recovering
his
consciousness
he
found
himself
buried
under
a
huge
mound
of
earth
with
only
his
head
and
his
left
arm
free
he
had
no
feeling
in
his
other
limbs
his
whole
body
had
grown
weightless
he
could
not
find
his
legs
nothing
was
there
that
he
could
move
but
there
was
a
burning
and
burrowing
that
came
from
somewhere
in
his
brain
scorched
his
forehead
and
made
his
tongue
swell
into
a
heavy
choking
lump
water
he
moaned
was
there
no
one
there
who
could
pour
a
drop
of
moisture
into
the
burning
hollow
of
his
mouth
no
one
at
all
then
where
was
weixler
he
must
be
near
by
or
else
was
it
possible
that
weixler
was
wounded
too
marschner
wanted
to
jump
up
and
find
out
what
had
happened
to
weixler
he
wanted
to
like
an
overburdened
his
left
hand
struggled
toward
his
head
and
when
he
at
last
succeeded
in
pushing
it
under
his
neck
he
felt
with
a
shudder
that
his
skull
offered
no
resistance
and
his
hand
slid
into
a
warm
soft
mush
and
his
hair
pasty
with
coagulated
blood
stuck
to
his
fingers
like
warm
moist
felt
dying
went
through
him
with
a
chill
to
die
there
all
alone
and
weixler
he
had
to
find
out
what
had
happened
to
happened
to
with
a
superhuman
effort
he
propped
his
head
up
on
his
left
hand
high
enough
to
have
a
view
of
a
few
paces
along
the
trench
now
he
saw
weixler
with
his
back
turned
leaning
on
his
right
side
against
the
trench
wall
standing
there
crookedly
his
left
hand
pressed
against
his
body
his
shoulders
hunched
as
if
he
had
a
cramp
the
captain
raised
himself
a
little
higher
and
saw
the
ground
and
a
broad
dark
shadow
that
weixler
cast
blood
he
was
bleeding
or
what
surely
that
was
blood
it
could
be
anything
but
blood
and
yet
it
stretched
out
so
peculiarly
and
drew
itself
like
a
thin
red
thread
up
to
weixler
up
to
where
his
hand
pressed
his
body
as
though
he
wanted
to
pull
up
the
roots
that
bound
him
to
the
earth
the
captain
to
see
he
pulled
his
head
farther
out
from
under
the
mound
and
uttered
a
hoarse
cry
a
cry
of
infinite
horror
the
wretched
man
was
dragging
his
entrails
behind
him
weixler
burst
from
him
in
a
shudder
of
compassion
the
man
turned
slowly
looked
down
at
marschner
questioningly
pale
sad
with
frightened
eyes
he
stood
like
that
only
the
fraction
of
a
second
then
he
lost
his
balance
reeled
and
fell
down
and
was
lost
from
the
captain
circle
of
vision
their
glances
scarcely
had
time
to
cross
the
pallid
face
had
merely
flitted
by
and
yet
it
stood
there
remained
fixed
in
the
air
with
a
mild
soft
plaintive
expression
about
the
narrow
lips
an
unforgettable
air
of
gentle
anxious
resignation
he
is
suffering
flashed
through
marschner
he
is
suffering
it
exulted
him
and
a
glow
suffused
his
pallor
his
fingers
sticky
with
blood
seemed
to
caress
the
air
until
his
head
sank
backward
and
his
eyes
broke
the
first
soldiers
who
penetrated
the
towering
mound
of
earth
to
where
he
lay
found
him
dead
but
in
spite
of
his
ghastly
wound
a
contented
almost
happy
smile
hovered
about
his
lips
iii
the
victor
on
the
big
square
before
the
old
courthouse
which
now
served
as
regimental
headquarters
and
bore
the
magic
letters
as
a
sort
of
cabalistic
sign
on
its
front
a
military
band
played
every
afternoon
from
three
to
four
at
command
of
his
excellency
this
little
diversion
was
meant
to
compensate
the
civilian
population
for
the
many
inconveniences
that
the
quartering
of
several
hundreds
of
staff
officers
and
a
number
of
lesser
officers
inevitably
brought
upon
them
then
too
according
to
his
excellency
such
an
institution
helped
considerably
to
promote
the
popularity
of
the
army
and
inspire
patriotism
in
school
children
and
the
masses
in
the
interest
of
the
right
conduct
of
the
war
the
strict
commander
deemed
it
highly
essential
to
foster
a
right
attitude
in
the
public
and
to
encourage
friendly
relations
between
military
and
civilian
authorities
while
fully
preserving
his
own
privileges
it
was
essential
to
a
successful
continuation
of
the
war
incidentally
the
fact
that
the
staff
officers
with
his
excellency
at
their
head
usually
took
their
black
coffee
at
just
about
this
time
had
helped
a
good
deal
to
bring
about
these
afternoon
concerts
it
was
indeed
delightful
to
sit
in
the
shade
of
the
centenarian
whose
intertwining
branches
overarched
the
entire
square
like
the
nave
of
a
cathedral
the
autumn
sun
cast
a
dull
glow
on
the
walls
of
the
houses
round
about
and
shed
golden
rings
through
the
thick
foliage
on
the
small
round
tables
arrayed
in
long
rows
in
front
of
the
coffeehouse
there
was
a
reserved
row
for
the
staff
officers
set
in
snowy
linens
with
little
flower
vases
and
fresh
crisp
cakes
which
the
sergeant
of
the
commissary
brought
punctually
at
three
every
day
from
the
field
bakery
where
they
had
been
baked
with
particular
care
under
the
personal
supervision
of
the
chef
especially
for
his
excellency
and
staff
it
was
a
beautiful
gay
picture
of
lively
varied
metropolitan
life
that
surged
about
the
music
pavilion
every
one
seemed
as
joyous
and
carefree
as
on
the
graben
in
vienna
on
a
sunny
spring
sunday
in
times
of
undisturbed
peace
the
children
crowded
around
the
orchestra
beat
the
measure
and
applauded
enthusiastically
after
every
piece
the
streets
leading
into
the
square
were
filled
with
giggling
girls
and
students
wearing
bright
caps
while
the
the
wives
of
the
resident
officials
and
merchants
sat
in
the
confectioner
shop
on
the
square
eagerly
awaiting
an
opportunity
to
show
their
righteous
indignation
at
the
daring
millinery
transparent
hose
and
little
more
than
skirts
of
a
certain
class
of
women
who
had
forced
their
way
into
the
town
and
despite
all
protests
and
orders
were
shamelessly
plying
their
trade
in
broad
daylight
but
the
chief
tone
was
given
by
the
transient
officers
whether
on
furlough
or
on
their
way
back
to
the
front
they
all
had
to
pass
through
this
town
and
enjoyed
in
deep
draughts
this
first
or
last
day
of
freedom
besides
if
anything
was
needed
at
the
front
nails
sanitary
appliances
or
bottled
beer
this
first
little
big
town
was
the
quickest
most
convenient
place
to
buy
it
in
an
unlucky
or
an
unpopular
man
merely
received
a
commendation
for
his
bravery
and
that
settled
him
but
the
man
who
enjoyed
his
commanding
officer
favor
was
given
the
preference
to
do
the
shopping
here
as
a
reward
and
an
amazing
ingenuity
developed
in
discovering
immediate
necessities
a
secret
arithmetical
relation
undeniably
existed
between
the
consumption
of
charcoal
axle
grease
by
individual
troop
divisions
and
the
distance
of
their
outposts
from
this
favorite
provisioning
station
of
course
the
pleasure
did
not
last
long
there
was
just
enough
time
for
a
hot
for
showing
off
one
best
uniform
once
or
twice
on
the
main
streets
for
taking
two
meals
at
a
table
spread
with
a
tablecloth
and
for
spending
a
short
night
in
a
comfortable
bed
with
or
if
the
man
could
not
help
it
without
caresses
and
then
off
again
depressed
and
irritable
off
to
the
maddeningly
overcrowded
railroad
station
back
to
the
front
into
the
damp
trench
or
the
sunbaked
block
house
the
greed
of
life
in
these
young
officers
who
promenaded
through
the
town
the
racing
of
their
blood
like
a
diver
who
fills
his
lungs
full
in
one
second
had
gradually
infected
the
entire
boresome
little
place
it
tingled
it
foamed
it
enriched
itself
and
became
frivolous
it
could
not
get
enough
sensations
now
that
it
stood
in
the
center
of
world
activities
and
had
a
claim
upon
real
events
the
crowd
surged
past
the
music
in
holiday
attire
and
holiday
mood
on
this
ordinary
quivering
to
the
rhythm
of
the
blue
danube
waltz
which
the
orchestra
was
playing
catchingly
with
a
roll
of
drums
and
a
clash
of
cymbals
the
whole
spectacle
brought
to
mind
the
behind
the
scenes
in
a
huge
playhouse
during
the
performance
of
a
tragedy
with
choruses
and
mob
scenes
nothing
was
seen
or
heard
here
of
the
sanguinary
piece
being
enacted
at
the
front
the
features
of
the
actors
relaxed
they
rested
or
threw
themselves
into
the
gay
hubbub
heartily
glad
not
to
know
how
the
tragedy
was
progressing
exactly
as
real
actors
behind
the
scenes
fall
back
into
their
unprofessional
selves
until
they
get
their
next
cue
sitting
in
the
shade
of
the
old
trees
over
coffee
and
cigars
comfortably
watching
these
doings
one
might
easily
be
deluded
into
thinking
that
the
drama
taking
place
at
the
front
was
nothing
but
a
jolly
spectacular
play
from
this
point
of
view
the
whole
war
showed
up
like
a
stream
that
washes
orchestras
ashore
brings
wealth
and
gaiety
to
the
people
is
navigated
by
promenading
officers
and
directed
by
portly
comfortable
generals
no
suggestion
of
its
bloody
side
no
roar
of
artillery
reaching
your
ears
no
wounded
soldier
dragging
in
his
personal
wretchedness
and
so
striking
a
false
note
in
the
general
jollification
of
course
it
had
not
always
been
like
that
in
the
first
days
when
the
daily
concert
still
had
the
charm
of
novelty
all
the
regular
emergency
and
reserve
hospitals
in
the
neighborhood
had
poured
their
vast
number
of
convalescents
and
slightly
wounded
men
into
the
square
but
that
lasted
only
two
days
then
his
excellency
summoned
the
head
army
physician
to
a
short
interview
and
in
sharp
terms
made
it
clear
to
the
crushed
culprit
what
an
unfavorable
influence
such
a
sight
would
have
upon
the
public
and
expressed
the
hope
that
men
wearing
bandages
or
maimed
men
or
any
men
who
might
have
a
depressing
effect
on
the
general
war
enthusiasm
should
henceforth
remain
in
the
hospitals
he
was
not
defrauded
of
his
hope
no
disagreeable
sight
ever
again
marred
his
pleasure
when
with
his
favorite
havana
between
his
teeth
he
gazed
past
the
long
row
of
his
subordinates
out
on
the
street
no
one
ever
went
by
without
casting
a
shy
deferential
at
the
omnipotent
director
of
battles
who
sat
there
like
any
other
ordinary
human
being
sipping
his
coffee
although
he
was
the
celebrated
general
x
unlimited
master
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
human
lives
the
man
the
papers
liked
to
call
the
victor
of
there
was
not
a
human
being
in
the
town
whose
fate
he
could
not
have
changed
with
one
stroke
of
his
pen
there
was
nothing
he
could
not
promote
or
destroy
as
he
saw
fit
his
good
will
meant
orders
for
army
supplies
and
wealth
or
distinction
and
advancement
his
ill
will
meant
no
prospects
at
all
or
an
order
to
march
along
the
way
that
led
to
certain
death
leaning
back
comfortably
in
the
large
wicker
chair
a
chair
destined
in
all
likelihood
some
day
to
become
an
object
of
historic
interest
the
powerful
one
jested
gaily
with
the
wife
of
his
adjutant
he
pointed
to
the
street
where
the
crowds
surged
in
the
brilliant
sunshine
and
said
with
a
sort
of
satisfied
triumphant
delight
in
his
tone
just
look
i
should
like
to
show
this
picture
to
our
pacifists
who
always
act
as
though
war
were
nothing
but
a
hideous
carnage
you
should
have
seen
this
hole
in
peace
times
it
was
enough
to
put
you
to
sleep
why
the
porter
at
the
corner
is
earning
more
than
the
biggest
merchant
used
to
earn
before
the
war
and
have
you
noticed
the
young
fellows
who
come
back
from
the
front
sunburnt
healthy
and
happy
most
of
them
before
the
war
were
employed
in
offices
they
held
themselves
badly
and
were
dissipated
and
looked
cheesy
i
assure
you
the
world
has
never
been
so
healthy
as
it
is
now
but
if
you
look
at
your
newspapers
you
read
about
a
about
a
europe
and
a
whole
lot
of
other
stuff
he
raised
his
bushy
white
eyebrows
until
they
reached
the
middle
of
his
bulging
forehead
and
his
small
piercing
black
eyes
skimmed
observantly
over
the
faces
of
those
present
his
excellency
pronouncement
was
a
suggestion
to
the
others
and
was
immediately
taken
up
at
every
table
the
conversation
grew
animated
the
benefits
of
the
war
were
told
over
and
the
wits
cracked
jokes
at
the
expense
of
the
pacifists
there
was
not
a
single
man
in
the
whole
assemblage
who
did
not
owe
at
least
two
blessings
to
the
war
financial
independence
and
such
munificence
of
living
as
only
money
magnates
have
allotted
to
them
in
times
of
peace
among
this
circle
of
people
the
war
wore
the
mask
of
a
santa
claus
with
a
bag
full
of
wonderful
gifts
on
his
back
and
assignments
for
brilliant
careers
in
his
hand
to
be
sure
here
and
there
a
gentleman
was
to
be
seen
wearing
a
on
his
sleeve
for
a
brother
or
a
who
as
officer
had
seen
that
other
aspect
of
the
war
the
gorgon
face
yet
the
gorgon
face
was
so
far
away
more
than
sixty
miles
in
a
and
an
occasional
excursion
in
its
vicinity
was
an
exciting
little
adventure
a
brief
titillation
of
the
nerves
inside
an
hour
the
automobile
raced
back
to
safety
back
to
the
and
you
promenaded
asphalt
streets
again
in
shining
pumps
so
who
would
refrain
from
joining
in
the
hymn
of
praise
to
his
excellency
the
mighty
man
contentedly
listened
a
while
longer
to
the
babel
of
voices
aroused
by
what
he
had
said
then
gradually
sank
back
into
his
reflections
and
gazed
ahead
of
him
seriously
he
saw
the
sunbeams
sifting
through
the
thick
foliage
and
glittering
on
the
crosses
and
stars
that
covered
the
left
half
of
his
chest
in
three
close
rows
it
was
a
magnificent
and
complete
collection
of
every
decoration
that
the
rulers
of
four
great
empires
had
to
bestow
upon
a
man
for
heroism
contempt
of
death
and
high
merit
there
was
no
honor
left
for
the
victor
of
still
to
aspire
to
and
only
eleven
short
months
of
war
had
cast
all
that
at
his
feet
it
was
the
harvest
of
but
a
single
year
of
war
years
of
his
life
had
previously
gone
in
the
service
in
tedious
monotony
in
an
eternal
struggle
with
sordid
everyday
cares
he
had
worn
himself
out
over
all
the
exigencies
of
a
petty
bourgeois
existence
like
a
poor
man
ashamed
of
his
poverty
making
pathetic
efforts
to
conceal
a
tear
in
his
clothes
and
always
seeing
the
telltale
hole
staring
out
from
under
the
covering
for
years
he
had
never
swerved
from
disciplining
himself
to
abstemiousness
and
there
was
much
gold
on
his
uniform
but
very
little
in
his
pocket
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
been
quite
ready
for
some
time
to
quit
he
was
thoroughly
tired
of
the
cheap
pleasure
of
tyrannizing
over
the
young
officers
on
the
drill
ground
but
then
the
miracle
occurred
over
night
the
grouchy
obscure
old
gentleman
changed
into
a
sort
of
national
hero
a
european
celebrity
he
was
the
victor
of
it
was
like
in
a
fairy
tale
when
the
good
fairy
appears
and
frees
the
enchanted
prince
from
his
hideous
disguise
and
he
emerges
in
his
glowing
youth
surrounded
by
knights
and
lackeys
and
enters
his
magnificent
castle
to
be
sure
the
miracle
had
not
brought
the
general
the
glow
of
youth
but
it
put
elasticity
into
him
the
eventful
year
had
given
him
a
shaking
up
and
his
veins
pulsed
with
the
joy
of
life
and
the
energy
for
work
of
a
man
in
his
prime
it
was
as
a
sovereign
that
he
sat
there
in
the
shadow
of
the
with
good
fortune
sparkling
on
his
chest
and
a
city
lying
at
his
feet
nothing
not
a
single
thing
was
lacking
to
make
the
fairy
tale
perfect
in
front
of
the
guarded
by
two
sturdy
corporals
rested
the
great
grey
beast
with
the
lungs
of
a
hundred
horses
in
its
chest
awaiting
the
to
rush
its
master
off
to
his
castle
high
above
town
and
valley
where
were
the
days
when
with
his
general
stripes
on
his
trousers
he
took
the
to
his
home
befitting
his
station
in
life
a
apartment
that
was
really
a
apartment
plus
a
closet
where
was
all
that
centuries
had
given
their
noblest
powers
generations
had
expended
their
artistic
skill
in
filling
the
castle
requisitioned
for
his
excellency
the
of
the
th
army
with
the
choicest
treasure
sun
and
time
had
done
their
best
to
mellow
the
dazzle
of
the
accumulated
wealth
till
it
shone
in
subdued
grandeur
as
through
a
delicate
veil
any
man
master
in
that
house
who
mounted
those
broad
steps
and
shouted
his
wishes
in
those
aristocratic
rooms
necessarily
felt
like
a
king
and
could
not
take
the
war
in
any
other
way
than
as
a
glorious
fairy
tale
indeed
was
there
ever
a
royal
household
that
approached
the
miraculous
more
closely
in
the
kitchen
reigned
a
master
of
the
culinary
art
the
chef
of
the
best
hotel
in
the
country
who
in
other
circumstances
would
not
have
been
satisfied
with
double
the
wages
of
a
general
and
was
now
getting
only
a
dollar
a
day
yet
he
was
using
every
bit
of
his
skill
he
had
never
been
so
eager
to
please
the
palate
of
him
whom
he
served
the
roast
he
prepared
was
the
finest
piece
of
meat
to
be
selected
from
among
the
two
hundred
oxen
that
daily
gave
up
their
lives
to
the
army
for
the
fatherland
the
men
who
served
the
roast
on
silver
platters
wrought
by
pupils
of
benvenuto
for
the
ancestors
of
the
house
were
generals
of
their
trade
who
in
peace
times
had
had
their
clothes
built
in
london
and
stood
about
tremblingly
awaiting
each
sign
from
their
master
and
this
entire
retinue
this
whole
princely
household
functioned
quite
automatically
and
entirely
without
cost
the
master
for
whom
every
one
slaved
never
once
had
to
perform
that
inevitable
nuisance
of
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
to
draw
out
his
purse
the
gasoline
circulated
inexhaustibly
through
the
veins
of
the
three
motor
cars
which
lounged
day
and
night
on
the
marble
flagging
of
the
courtyard
as
by
magic
everything
flowed
in
that
eye
and
palate
could
desire
no
servant
asked
for
wages
everything
seemed
to
be
there
of
itself
as
in
fairy
castles
where
it
is
enough
to
wish
for
a
thing
in
order
to
have
it
but
that
was
not
all
it
was
not
the
whole
of
the
miracle
that
the
table
spread
itself
every
day
of
the
month
and
the
filled
themselves
with
provisions
when
the
first
of
the
month
came
round
instead
of
bills
came
fluttering
into
the
house
no
worry
no
disputing
no
stinting
of
one
self
to
be
borne
with
a
sigh
with
an
air
of
boredom
one
stuffed
his
pockets
with
greenbacks
which
were
really
quite
superfluous
in
this
lazy
man
paradise
that
the
war
had
opened
up
to
its
vassals
one
single
lowering
cloud
now
and
then
streaked
the
shining
firmament
of
this
wonderland
and
cast
its
shadow
on
the
brow
of
his
excellency
sometimes
his
pure
joy
was
disturbed
by
the
thought
that
the
fairy
tale
might
give
way
to
reality
and
he
might
be
awakened
from
the
glorious
dream
it
was
not
peace
that
his
excellency
dreaded
he
never
even
thought
of
peace
but
what
if
the
wall
so
artfully
constructed
out
of
human
bodies
should
begin
to
totter
some
day
what
if
the
enemy
were
to
penetrate
all
the
fortifications
and
discipline
were
to
give
way
to
panic
and
the
mighty
wall
should
dissolve
into
its
component
parts
human
beings
fleeing
madly
to
save
their
lives
then
the
victor
of
the
almighty
fairy
tale
king
would
sink
back
again
into
the
sordid
commonplace
of
old
he
would
have
to
eke
out
his
existence
in
some
obscure
corner
crowd
his
trophies
into
some
modest
apartment
and
content
himself
like
other
discharged
officers
with
being
a
coffeehouse
king
were
he
to
suffer
a
single
defeat
the
world
would
instantly
forget
its
enthusiasm
another
general
would
assume
the
reign
another
sovereign
would
fly
through
the
town
in
a
motor
car
and
the
vast
retinue
of
servants
would
reverently
bow
before
their
new
ruler
the
old
one
would
be
nothing
but
a
past
episode
a
scarecrow
revealed
which
any
sparrow
impudently
besmirches
the
general
pudgy
hand
involuntarily
clenched
itself
and
the
dreaded
frown
the
that
his
own
soldiers
as
well
as
the
enemy
had
learned
to
fear
appeared
for
a
moment
on
his
prominent
forehead
then
his
face
cleared
again
and
his
excellency
looked
around
proudly
no
the
victor
of
was
not
afraid
his
wall
stood
firm
and
swayed
not
for
three
months
every
report
that
emissaries
brought
to
camp
had
told
of
the
enormous
preparations
being
made
by
the
enemy
for
three
months
they
had
been
storing
up
ammunition
and
gathering
together
their
forces
for
the
tremendous
offensive
and
the
offensive
had
begun
the
night
before
the
general
knew
that
the
crowd
gaily
thronging
in
the
sun
would
not
read
in
the
newspaper
till
the
next
morning
that
out
at
the
front
a
fierce
battle
had
been
raging
for
the
past
twenty
hours
and
hardly
sixty
miles
from
the
promenade
shells
were
bursting
without
cease
and
a
heavy
rain
of
hot
iron
was
pouring
down
upon
his
soldiers
three
infantry
attacks
had
already
been
reported
as
repulsed
and
now
the
artillery
was
hammering
with
frenzied
fury
a
prologue
to
fresh
conflicts
during
the
night
well
let
them
come
with
a
jerk
his
excellency
sat
up
and
while
his
fingers
beat
on
the
table
in
tune
to
the
blue
danube
a
tense
expression
came
into
his
face
as
though
he
could
hear
the
terrific
drumfire
raging
at
the
front
like
a
hurricane
his
preparations
had
been
made
the
human
reservoir
had
been
filled
to
overflowing
two
hundred
thousand
strong
young
lads
of
the
very
right
age
lay
behind
the
lines
ready
at
the
proper
moment
to
be
thrown
in
front
of
the
until
it
caught
and
stuck
in
a
marsh
of
blood
and
bones
just
let
them
come
the
more
the
merrier
the
victor
of
was
prepared
to
add
another
branch
to
his
laurels
and
his
eyes
sparkled
like
the
medals
on
his
breast
his
adjutant
got
up
from
the
table
next
to
his
approached
hesitatingly
and
whispered
a
few
words
in
his
excellency
ear
the
great
man
shook
his
head
waving
the
adjutant
off
it
is
an
important
foreign
newspaper
your
excellency
the
adjutant
urged
and
when
his
commander
still
waved
him
aside
he
added
significantly
the
gentleman
has
brought
a
letter
of
recommendation
from
headquarters
your
excellency
at
this
the
general
finally
gave
in
arose
with
a
sigh
and
said
half
in
jest
half
in
annoyance
to
the
lady
beside
him
a
drumfire
would
be
more
welcome
then
he
followed
his
adjutant
and
shook
hands
jovially
with
the
bald
civilian
who
popped
up
from
his
seat
and
bent
at
the
middle
like
a
penknife
snapping
shut
his
excellency
invited
him
to
be
seated
the
war
correspondent
stammered
a
few
words
of
admiration
and
opened
his
expectantly
a
whole
string
of
questions
on
his
lips
but
his
excellency
did
not
let
him
speak
in
the
course
of
time
he
had
constructed
for
occasions
like
this
a
speech
in
which
every
point
was
well
thought
out
and
which
made
a
simple
impression
he
delivered
it
now
speaking
with
emphasis
and
pausing
occasionally
to
recall
what
came
next
to
begin
with
he
spoke
of
his
brave
soldiers
praising
their
courage
their
contempt
of
death
their
wonderful
deeds
of
valor
then
he
expressed
regret
at
the
impossibility
of
rewarding
each
soldier
according
to
his
merits
and
this
in
a
raised
voice
invoked
the
fatherland
eternal
gratitude
for
such
loyalty
and
even
unto
death
pointing
to
the
heavy
crop
of
medals
on
his
chest
he
explained
that
the
distinctions
awarded
him
were
really
an
honor
done
to
his
men
finally
he
wove
in
a
few
remarks
complimenting
the
enemy
fighting
ability
and
cautious
leadership
and
concluded
with
an
expression
of
his
unshakable
confidence
in
ultimate
victory
the
newspaper
man
listened
respectfully
and
occasionally
jotted
down
a
note
the
main
thing
of
course
was
to
observe
the
great
appearance
his
manner
of
speech
his
gestures
and
to
sum
up
his
personality
in
a
few
striking
phrases
his
excellency
now
discarded
his
military
role
and
changed
himself
from
the
victor
of
into
the
man
of
the
world
you
are
going
to
the
front
now
he
asked
with
a
courteous
smile
and
responded
to
the
correspondent
enthusiastic
yes
with
a
deep
melancholy
sigh
how
fortunate
you
are
i
envy
you
you
see
the
tragedy
in
the
life
of
the
general
of
is
that
he
can
not
lead
his
men
personally
into
the
fray
he
spends
his
whole
life
preparing
for
war
he
is
a
soldier
in
body
and
soul
and
yet
he
knows
the
excitement
of
battle
only
from
hearsay
the
correspondent
was
delighted
with
this
subjective
utterance
which
he
had
managed
to
evoke
now
he
could
show
the
commander
in
the
sympathetic
rôle
of
one
who
renounces
one
who
can
not
always
do
as
he
would
he
bent
over
his
for
an
instant
when
he
looked
up
again
he
found
to
his
astonishment
that
his
excellency
face
had
completely
changed
his
brow
was
furrowed
his
eyes
stared
with
an
anxiously
expectant
look
in
them
at
something
back
of
the
correspondent
the
correspondent
turned
and
saw
a
pale
emaciated
infantry
captain
making
straight
toward
his
excellency
the
man
was
grinning
and
he
had
a
peculiar
shambling
walk
he
came
closer
and
closer
and
stared
with
glassy
glaring
eyes
and
laughed
an
ugly
idiotic
laugh
the
adjutant
started
up
from
his
seat
frightened
the
veins
on
his
forehead
swelled
up
like
ropes
the
correspondent
saw
an
assassination
coming
and
turned
pale
the
uncanny
captain
swayed
to
within
a
foot
or
two
of
the
general
and
his
adjutant
then
stood
still
giggled
foolishly
and
snatched
at
the
orders
on
his
excellency
chest
like
a
child
snatching
at
a
beam
of
light
beautiful
shines
beautifully
he
gurgled
in
a
thick
voice
then
he
pointed
his
frightfully
thin
trembling
forefinger
up
at
the
sun
and
shrieked
sun
next
he
snatched
at
the
medals
again
and
said
shines
beautifully
and
all
the
while
his
restless
glance
wandered
hither
and
thither
as
if
looking
for
something
and
his
ugly
bestial
laugh
repeated
itself
after
each
word
his
excellency
right
fist
was
up
in
the
air
ready
for
a
blow
at
the
fellow
chest
for
approaching
him
so
disrespectfully
but
instead
he
laid
his
hand
soothingly
on
the
poor
idiot
shoulder
i
suppose
you
have
come
from
the
hospital
to
listen
to
the
music
captain
he
said
winking
to
his
adjutant
it
a
long
ride
to
the
hospital
in
the
take
my
automobile
it
quicker
auto
quicker
echoed
the
lunatic
with
his
hideous
laugh
he
patiently
let
himself
be
taken
by
the
arm
and
led
away
he
turned
round
once
with
a
grin
at
the
glittering
medals
but
the
adjutant
pulled
him
along
the
general
followed
them
with
his
eyes
until
they
entered
the
machine
the
was
hoisted
ominously
between
his
eyebrows
he
was
boiling
with
rage
at
such
carelessness
in
allowing
a
creature
like
that
to
walk
abroad
freely
but
in
the
nick
of
time
he
remembered
the
civilian
at
his
side
and
controlled
himself
and
said
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
yes
these
are
some
of
the
sad
aspects
of
the
war
you
see
it
is
just
because
of
such
things
that
the
leader
must
stay
behind
where
nothing
appeals
to
his
heart
no
general
could
ever
summon
the
necessary
severity
to
direct
a
war
if
he
had
to
witness
all
the
misery
at
the
front
very
interesting
the
correspondent
breathed
gratefully
and
closed
his
book
i
fear
i
have
already
taken
up
too
much
of
your
valuable
time
but
may
i
be
permitted
one
more
question
when
does
your
excellency
hope
for
peace
the
general
started
bit
his
underlip
and
glanced
aside
with
a
look
that
would
have
made
every
staff
officer
of
the
th
army
shake
in
his
boots
with
a
visible
effort
he
put
on
his
polite
smile
and
pointed
across
the
square
to
the
open
portals
of
the
old
cathedral
the
only
advice
i
can
give
is
for
you
to
go
over
there
and
ask
our
heavenly
father
he
is
the
only
one
who
can
answer
that
question
a
friendly
nod
a
hearty
handshake
then
his
excellency
strode
to
his
office
across
the
square
amid
the
respectful
salutations
of
the
crowd
when
he
entered
the
building
the
dreaded
furrow
cleaving
his
brow
was
deeper
than
ever
an
orderly
tremblingly
conducted
him
to
the
office
of
the
head
army
physician
for
several
minutes
the
entire
house
held
its
breath
while
the
voice
of
the
mighty
one
thundered
through
the
corridors
he
ordered
the
fine
old
physician
to
come
to
his
table
as
if
he
were
his
secretary
and
dictated
a
decree
forbidding
all
the
inmates
of
the
hospitals
without
distinction
or
exception
whether
sick
or
wounded
to
leave
the
hospital
premises
for
the
decree
concluded
if
a
man
is
ill
he
belongs
in
bed
and
if
he
feels
strong
enough
to
go
to
town
and
sit
in
the
he
should
report
at
the
front
where
his
duty
calls
him
this
pacing
to
and
fro
with
clinking
spurs
and
this
thundering
at
the
cowering
old
doctor
calmed
his
anger
the
storm
had
about
blown
over
when
unfortunately
the
general
notice
was
drawn
to
the
report
from
the
brigade
that
was
being
most
heavily
beset
by
the
enemy
and
had
suffered
desperate
losses
and
was
holding
its
post
only
in
order
to
make
the
enterprise
as
costly
as
possible
to
the
advancing
enemy
behind
it
the
mines
had
already
been
laid
and
a
whole
new
division
was
already
in
wait
in
subterranean
hiding
ready
to
prepare
a
little
surprise
for
the
enemy
after
the
doomed
brigade
had
gone
to
its
destruction
of
course
the
general
had
not
considered
it
necessary
to
inform
the
brigadier
that
he
was
holding
a
lost
post
and
all
he
was
to
do
was
to
sell
his
hide
as
dearly
as
possible
the
longer
the
struggle
raged
the
better
and
men
fight
so
much
more
stubbornly
if
they
hope
for
relief
until
the
very
last
moment
all
this
his
excellency
himself
had
ordained
and
he
was
really
greatly
rejoiced
that
the
brigade
was
still
holding
out
after
three
overwhelming
infantry
charges
but
now
a
report
lay
before
him
which
went
against
all
military
tradition
and
it
brought
back
the
storm
that
had
been
about
to
subside
the
his
excellency
made
careful
note
of
his
name
described
the
frightful
effect
of
the
drumfire
in
a
nervous
talkative
way
that
was
most
unmilitary
instead
of
confining
himself
to
a
statement
of
numbers
he
explained
at
length
how
his
brigade
had
been
decimated
and
his
men
power
of
resistance
was
gone
he
concluded
his
report
by
begging
for
reinforcements
else
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
remnant
of
his
company
to
withstand
the
attack
to
take
place
that
night
impossible
impossible
his
excellency
blared
like
a
trumpet
into
the
ears
of
the
gentlemen
standing
motionless
around
him
impossible
since
when
is
the
commander
instructed
by
his
subordinates
as
to
what
is
possible
and
what
is
not
blue
in
the
face
with
rage
he
took
a
pen
and
wrote
this
single
sentence
in
answer
to
the
report
the
sector
is
to
be
held
underneath
he
signed
his
name
in
the
perpendicular
scrawl
that
every
school
child
knew
from
the
picture
card
of
the
victor
of
he
himself
put
the
envelope
into
the
hand
for
it
to
be
taken
to
the
wireless
station
as
the
telephone
wires
of
the
brigade
had
long
since
been
shot
into
the
ground
then
he
blustered
like
a
storm
cloud
from
room
to
room
stayed
half
an
hour
in
the
card
room
had
a
short
interview
with
the
chief
of
the
staff
and
asked
to
have
the
evening
reports
sent
to
the
castle
when
his
rumbling
good
night
gentlemen
at
last
resounded
in
the
large
hall
under
the
dome
every
one
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
the
guard
stood
at
attention
the
chauffeur
started
the
motor
and
the
big
machine
plunged
into
the
street
with
a
bellow
like
a
wild
beast
panting
and
tooting
it
darted
its
way
through
the
narrow
streets
out
into
the
open
where
the
castle
like
a
fairy
palace
looked
down
into
the
misty
valley
below
with
its
pearly
rows
of
illuminated
windows
with
his
coat
collar
turned
up
his
excellency
sat
in
the
car
and
reflected
as
he
usually
did
at
this
time
on
the
things
that
had
happened
during
the
day
the
correspondent
came
to
his
mind
and
the
man
stupid
question
when
does
your
excellency
hope
for
peace
hope
was
it
credible
that
a
man
who
must
have
some
standing
in
his
profession
else
he
never
would
have
received
a
letter
of
recommendation
from
headquarters
had
so
little
suspicion
of
how
contrary
that
was
to
every
soldierly
feeling
hope
for
peace
what
good
was
a
general
to
expect
from
peace
could
this
civilian
not
comprehend
that
a
commanding
general
really
commanded
was
really
a
general
just
in
times
of
war
while
in
times
of
peace
he
was
like
a
strict
teacher
in
galloons
an
old
duffer
who
occasionally
shouted
himself
hoarse
out
of
pure
ennui
was
he
to
long
for
that
dreary
treadmill
existence
again
was
he
to
hope
for
the
time
to
please
the
gentlemen
civilians
when
he
the
victorious
leader
of
the
th
army
would
be
used
again
merely
for
reviews
was
he
to
await
impatiently
going
back
to
that
other
hopeless
struggle
between
a
meager
salary
and
a
life
polished
for
show
a
struggle
in
which
the
lack
of
money
always
came
out
triumphant
the
general
leaned
back
on
the
cushioned
seat
in
annoyance
suddenly
the
car
stopped
with
a
jerk
right
in
the
middle
of
the
road
the
general
started
up
in
surprise
and
was
about
to
question
the
chauffeur
when
the
first
big
drops
of
rain
fell
on
his
helmet
it
was
the
same
storm
that
earlier
in
the
afternoon
had
given
the
men
at
the
front
a
short
respite
the
two
corporals
jumped
out
and
quickly
put
up
the
top
his
excellency
sat
stark
upright
leaned
his
ear
to
the
wind
and
listened
attentively
mingled
with
the
rushing
sound
of
the
wind
he
caught
quite
clearly
but
very
very
faintly
a
dull
growling
a
hollow
scarcely
audible
pounding
like
the
distant
echo
of
trees
being
chopped
down
in
the
woods
drumfire
his
excellency
eyes
brightened
a
gleam
of
inner
satisfaction
passed
over
his
face
so
recently
clouded
with
vexation
thank
god
there
still
was
war
iv
my
comrade
this
world
war
has
given
me
a
comrade
too
you
could
find
a
better
one
it
is
exactly
fourteen
months
ago
that
i
met
him
for
the
first
time
in
a
small
piece
of
woods
near
the
road
to
goerz
since
then
he
has
never
left
my
side
for
a
single
moment
we
sat
up
together
hundreds
of
nights
through
and
still
he
walks
beside
me
steadfastly
not
that
he
intrudes
himself
upon
me
on
the
contrary
he
conscientiously
keeps
the
distance
that
separates
him
the
common
soldier
from
the
officer
that
he
must
respect
in
me
strictly
according
to
regulations
he
stands
three
paces
off
in
some
corner
or
behind
some
column
and
only
dares
to
cast
his
shy
glances
at
me
he
simply
wants
to
be
near
me
that
all
he
asks
for
just
for
me
to
let
him
be
in
my
presence
sometimes
i
close
my
eyes
to
be
by
myself
again
quite
by
myself
for
a
few
moments
as
i
used
to
be
before
the
war
then
he
fixes
his
gaze
upon
me
so
firmly
and
penetratingly
and
with
such
obstinate
reproachful
insistence
that
it
burns
into
my
back
settles
under
my
eyelids
and
so
steeps
my
being
with
the
picture
of
him
that
i
look
round
if
a
little
tune
has
passed
without
his
reminding
me
of
his
presence
he
has
gnawed
his
way
into
me
he
has
taken
up
his
abode
within
me
he
sits
inside
of
me
like
the
mysterious
magician
at
shows
who
turns
the
crank
inside
of
the
black
booth
above
the
heads
of
the
spectators
he
casts
his
picture
through
my
eyes
upon
every
wall
every
curtain
every
flat
surface
that
my
eyes
fall
on
but
even
when
there
is
no
background
for
his
picture
even
when
i
frantically
look
out
of
the
window
and
stare
into
the
distance
so
as
to
be
rid
of
him
for
a
short
while
even
then
he
is
there
hovering
in
front
of
me
as
though
impaled
upon
the
lance
of
my
gaze
like
a
banner
swaying
at
the
head
of
a
parade
if
could
penetrate
the
skull
one
would
find
his
picture
woven
into
my
brain
in
vague
outline
like
the
figures
in
old
tapestries
i
remember
a
trip
i
took
before
the
war
from
munich
to
vienna
on
the
oriental
express
i
looked
out
upon
the
autumnal
mellowness
of
the
country
around
the
bavarian
lakes
and
the
golden
glow
of
the
wiener
wald
but
across
all
this
glory
that
i
drank
in
leaning
back
on
the
comfortable
seat
in
luxurious
contentment
there
steadily
ran
an
ugly
black
spot
a
flaw
in
the
that
is
the
way
my
obstinate
comrade
flits
across
woods
and
walls
stands
still
when
i
stand
still
dances
over
the
faces
of
over
the
asphalt
paving
wet
from
the
rain
over
everything
my
eyes
happen
to
fall
upon
he
interposes
himself
between
me
and
the
world
just
like
that
flaw
in
the
which
degraded
everything
i
saw
to
the
quality
of
the
background
that
it
made
the
physicians
of
course
know
better
they
do
not
believe
that
he
lives
in
me
and
stays
by
me
like
a
sworn
comrade
from
the
standpoint
of
science
it
rests
with
me
not
to
drag
him
round
any
longer
but
to
give
him
his
dismissal
precisely
as
i
might
have
freed
myself
from
the
annoying
spot
by
angrily
smashing
the
the
physicians
do
not
believe
that
one
human
being
can
unite
himself
at
death
with
another
human
being
and
continue
to
live
on
in
him
with
obstinate
persistence
it
is
their
opinion
that
a
man
standing
at
a
window
should
see
the
house
opposite
but
never
the
wall
of
the
room
behind
his
back
the
physicians
only
believe
in
things
that
such
superstitions
as
that
a
man
can
carry
dead
men
within
him
and
see
them
standing
in
front
of
him
so
distinctly
that
they
hide
a
picture
behind
them
from
his
sight
do
not
come
within
the
range
of
the
gentlemen
reasoning
in
their
lives
death
plays
no
part
a
patient
who
dies
ceases
to
be
a
patient
and
what
does
the
day
know
of
the
night
though
the
one
forever
succeeds
the
other
but
i
know
it
is
not
i
who
forcibly
drag
the
dead
comrade
through
my
life
i
know
that
the
dead
man
life
within
me
is
stronger
than
my
own
life
it
may
be
that
the
shapes
i
see
flitting
across
the
wall
papers
cowering
in
corners
and
staring
into
the
lighted
room
from
dark
balconies
and
knocking
so
hard
on
the
windows
that
the
panes
rattle
are
only
visions
and
nothing
more
where
do
they
come
from
brain
furnishes
the
picture
eyes
provide
the
projection
but
it
is
the
dead
man
that
sits
at
the
crank
he
tends
to
the
film
the
show
begins
when
it
suits
him
and
does
not
stop
as
long
as
he
turns
the
crank
how
can
i
help
seeing
what
he
shows
me
if
i
close
my
eyes
the
picture
falls
upon
the
inside
of
my
lids
and
the
drama
plays
inside
of
me
instead
of
dancing
far
away
over
doors
and
walls
i
should
be
the
stronger
of
the
two
they
say
but
you
can
not
kill
a
dead
man
the
physicians
should
know
that
are
not
the
paintings
by
titian
and
michael
angelo
still
hanging
in
the
museums
centuries
after
titian
and
michael
angelo
lived
and
the
pictures
that
a
dying
man
chiseled
into
my
brain
fourteen
months
ago
with
the
prodigious
strength
of
his
final
agony
are
they
supposed
to
disappear
simply
because
the
man
that
created
them
is
lying
in
his
soldier
grave
who
when
he
reads
or
hears
the
word
woods
does
not
see
some
woods
he
has
once
walked
through
or
looked
out
on
from
a
train
window
or
when
a
man
speaks
of
his
dead
father
does
he
not
see
the
face
that
has
long
been
rotting
in
the
grave
appear
again
now
stern
now
gentle
now
in
the
rigidity
of
the
last
moments
what
would
our
whole
existence
be
without
these
visions
which
each
at
its
own
word
rise
up
for
moments
out
of
oblivion
as
if
in
the
glare
of
a
flashlight
sick
of
course
the
world
is
sore
and
will
have
no
words
or
pictures
that
do
not
have
reference
to
the
wholesale
graves
not
for
a
moment
can
the
comrade
within
me
join
the
rest
of
the
dead
because
everything
that
happens
is
as
a
flashlight
falling
upon
him
there
the
newspaper
each
morning
to
begin
with
ships
sunk
attacks
repulsed
and
immediately
the
film
reels
off
a
whirl
of
gasping
struggling
men
fingers
rising
out
of
mountainous
waves
grasping
for
life
once
more
faces
disfigured
by
pain
and
fury
every
conversation
that
one
overhears
every
shop
window
every
breath
that
is
drawn
is
a
reminder
of
the
wholesale
carnage
even
the
silence
of
the
night
is
a
reminder
does
not
each
tick
of
the
mark
the
death
rattle
of
thousands
of
men
in
order
to
hear
the
hell
raging
yonder
on
the
other
side
of
the
thick
wall
of
air
is
it
not
enough
to
know
of
chins
blown
off
throats
cut
open
and
corpses
locked
in
a
death
embrace
if
a
man
were
lying
comfortably
in
bed
and
then
found
out
for
certain
that
some
one
next
door
was
being
murdered
would
you
say
he
was
sick
if
he
jumped
up
out
of
bed
with
his
heart
pounding
and
are
we
anything
but
next
door
to
the
places
where
thousands
duck
down
in
frantic
terror
where
the
earth
spits
mangled
fragments
of
bodies
up
into
the
sky
and
the
sky
hammers
down
on
the
earth
with
fists
of
iron
can
a
man
live
at
a
distance
from
his
crucified
self
when
the
whole
world
resounds
with
reminders
of
these
horrors
no
it
is
the
others
that
are
sick
they
are
sick
who
gloat
over
news
of
victories
and
see
conquered
miles
of
territory
rise
resplendent
above
mounds
of
corpses
they
are
sick
who
stretch
a
wall
of
flags
between
themselves
and
their
humanity
so
as
not
to
know
what
crimes
are
being
committed
against
their
brothers
in
the
beyond
that
they
call
the
front
every
man
is
sick
who
still
can
think
talk
discuss
sleep
knowing
that
other
men
holding
their
own
entrails
in
their
hands
are
crawling
like
worms
across
the
furrows
in
the
fields
and
before
they
reach
the
stations
for
the
wounded
are
dying
off
like
animals
while
somewhere
far
away
a
woman
with
passionate
longing
is
dreaming
beside
an
empty
bed
all
those
are
sick
who
can
fail
to
hear
the
moaning
the
gnashing
of
teeth
the
howling
the
crashing
and
bursting
the
wailing
and
cursing
and
agonizing
in
death
because
the
murmur
of
everyday
affairs
is
around
them
or
the
blissful
silence
of
night
it
is
the
deaf
and
the
blind
that
are
sick
not
i
it
is
the
dull
ones
that
are
sick
those
whose
souls
sing
neither
compassion
for
others
nor
their
own
anger
all
those
numerous
people
are
sick
who
like
a
violin
without
strings
merely
echo
every
sound
or
would
you
say
that
the
man
whose
memory
is
like
a
photographic
plate
on
which
the
light
has
fallen
and
which
can
not
record
any
more
impressions
is
the
healthy
man
is
not
memory
the
very
highest
possession
of
every
human
being
it
is
the
treasure
that
animals
do
not
own
because
they
are
incapable
of
holding
the
past
and
reviving
it
am
i
to
be
cured
of
my
memory
as
from
an
illness
why
without
my
memory
i
would
not
be
myself
because
every
man
is
built
up
of
his
memories
and
really
lives
only
as
long
as
he
goes
through
life
like
a
loaded
camera
supposing
i
could
not
tell
where
i
lived
in
my
childhood
what
color
my
father
eyes
and
my
mother
hair
were
and
supposing
at
any
moment
that
i
were
called
upon
to
give
an
account
i
could
not
turn
the
leaves
of
the
past
and
point
to
the
right
picture
how
quick
they
would
be
to
diagnose
my
case
as
feeblemindedness
or
imbecility
then
to
be
considered
mentally
normal
must
one
treat
one
brain
like
a
slate
to
be
sponged
off
and
be
able
at
command
to
tear
out
pictures
that
have
burned
the
most
hideous
misery
into
the
soul
and
throw
them
away
as
one
does
leaves
from
an
album
of
photographs
one
man
died
before
my
eyes
he
died
hard
torn
asunder
after
a
frightful
struggle
between
the
two
titans
life
and
death
am
i
sick
then
if
i
experience
all
over
again
all
the
phases
of
his
agonizing
preserved
in
my
brain
like
snapshots
as
long
as
every
happening
inexorably
opens
the
pages
of
this
series
and
the
other
people
are
they
well
those
i
mean
who
skip
the
pages
as
though
they
were
blank
that
record
the
dismemberment
the
mutilation
the
crushing
of
their
brothers
the
slow
writhing
to
death
of
men
caught
in
barbed
wire
entanglements
tell
me
my
dear
doctors
at
just
what
point
am
i
to
begin
to
forget
am
i
to
forget
i
was
in
the
war
am
i
to
forget
the
moment
in
the
smoky
railway
station
when
i
leaned
out
of
the
car
window
and
saw
my
boy
ashen
white
with
compressed
lips
standing
beside
his
mother
and
i
made
a
poor
show
of
cheerfulness
and
talked
of
seeing
them
soon
again
while
my
eyes
greedily
searched
the
features
of
my
wife
and
child
and
my
soul
drank
in
the
picture
of
them
like
parched
lips
after
a
many
days
march
drinking
in
the
water
so
madly
longed
for
am
i
to
forget
the
choking
and
the
bitterness
in
my
mouth
when
the
train
began
to
move
and
the
distance
swallowed
up
my
child
my
wife
my
world
and
the
whole
ride
to
death
when
i
was
the
only
military
traveler
in
a
car
full
of
happy
family
men
off
for
a
summer
sunday
in
the
country
am
i
to
tear
it
out
of
my
memory
like
so
much
cumbersome
waste
paper
am
i
to
forget
how
i
felt
when
it
grew
quieter
at
each
station
as
though
life
were
crumbling
away
bit
by
bit
until
at
midnight
only
one
or
two
sleepy
soldiers
remained
in
my
coach
and
an
ashen
young
face
drawn
with
sorrow
hovered
about
the
flickering
lamplight
must
one
actually
be
sick
if
it
is
like
an
incurable
wound
always
to
feel
that
of
home
and
warmth
that
riding
away
with
hatred
and
danger
awaiting
one
at
the
end
of
the
trip
is
there
anything
harder
to
understand
when
have
men
done
anything
madder
than
this
to
race
through
the
night
at
sixty
miles
an
hour
to
run
away
from
all
love
all
security
to
leave
the
train
and
take
another
train
because
it
is
the
only
one
that
goes
to
where
invisible
machines
belch
pieces
of
iron
and
death
casts
out
a
finely
meshed
net
of
steel
and
lead
to
capture
men
who
will
obliterate
from
my
soul
the
picture
of
that
small
dirty
junction
the
shivering
sleepy
soldiers
without
any
intoxication
or
music
in
their
blood
looking
wistfully
after
the
civilian
train
and
its
brightly
lighted
windows
as
it
disappeared
behind
the
trees
with
a
jolly
blow
of
its
whistle
who
will
obliterate
the
picture
of
that
exchanging
for
death
in
the
drab
light
of
early
dawn
and
supposing
i
could
cross
out
that
first
endless
night
as
something
settled
and
done
with
would
not
the
next
morning
remain
when
our
train
stopped
at
a
switch
in
the
middle
of
a
wide
dewy
meadow
and
we
were
told
that
we
had
to
wait
to
let
hospital
trains
go
by
how
shall
i
ever
banish
the
memory
of
those
thick
exhalations
of
lysol
and
blood
blown
upon
the
happy
fields
from
a
dragon
nostrils
wo
i
forever
see
those
endless
serpents
creeping
up
so
indolently
as
though
surfeited
with
mangled
human
flesh
from
hundreds
of
windows
white
bandages
gleamed
and
dull
glassy
eyes
stared
out
lying
crouching
on
top
of
each
other
body
to
body
they
even
hung
on
to
the
like
bloody
bunches
of
grapes
an
overflowing
abundance
of
distress
and
agony
and
those
wretched
remains
of
strength
and
youth
those
bruised
and
battered
men
looked
with
pity
yes
at
our
train
am
i
really
sick
because
those
glances
of
warm
compassion
from
bleeding
cripples
to
sound
strapping
young
fellows
burn
in
my
soul
with
a
fire
never
to
be
extinguished
an
apprehension
sent
a
chill
through
our
whole
train
the
foreboding
of
a
hell
that
one
would
rather
run
away
from
wrapped
in
bloody
bandages
than
go
to
meet
whole
and
strong
and
when
this
shudder
of
apprehension
has
turned
into
reality
into
experience
and
memory
is
it
to
be
shaken
off
as
long
as
such
trains
still
meet
every
day
a
casual
remark
about
the
transfer
of
troops
news
of
fresh
battles
inevitably
recall
this
first
actual
contact
with
the
war
just
as
a
certain
note
when
struck
will
produce
a
certain
tone
and
i
see
the
tracks
and
ties
and
stones
spattered
with
blood
shining
in
the
early
morning
light
of
a
summer
day
signposts
pointing
to
the
front
the
front
am
really
the
sick
person
because
i
can
not
utter
that
word
or
write
it
down
without
my
tongue
growing
coated
from
the
intense
hatred
i
feel
axe
not
the
others
mad
who
look
upon
this
wholesale
with
a
mixture
of
religious
devotion
romantic
longing
and
shy
sympathy
would
it
not
be
wiser
once
for
a
change
to
examine
those
others
for
the
state
of
their
mind
must
disclose
it
to
my
wise
physicians
who
watch
over
me
so
compassionately
that
all
this
mischief
is
the
work
of
a
few
words
that
have
been
let
loose
upon
humanity
like
a
pack
of
mad
dogs
front
enemy
hero
death
victory
the
curs
rage
through
the
world
with
frothing
mouth
and
rolling
eyes
millions
who
have
been
carefully
inoculated
against
smallpox
cholera
and
typhoid
fever
are
chased
into
madness
millions
on
either
side
are
packed
into
cars
ride
singing
to
meet
each
other
at
the
front
hack
stab
shoot
at
each
other
blow
each
other
into
bits
give
their
flesh
and
their
bones
for
the
bloody
hash
out
of
which
the
dish
of
peace
is
to
be
cooked
for
those
fortunate
ones
who
give
the
flesh
of
their
calves
and
oxen
to
their
fatherland
for
a
hundred
per
cent
profit
instead
of
carrying
their
own
flesh
to
market
for
fifty
cents
a
day
suppose
the
word
war
had
never
been
invented
and
had
never
been
hallowed
through
the
ages
and
decked
with
gay
trappings
who
would
dare
to
supplement
the
deficient
phrase
declaration
of
war
by
the
following
speech
after
long
fruitless
negotiations
our
emissary
to
the
government
of
x
left
from
the
window
of
his
parlor
car
he
raised
his
silk
hat
to
the
gentlemen
who
had
escorted
him
to
the
station
and
he
will
not
meet
them
with
a
friendly
smile
again
until
have
made
corpses
of
many
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
in
the
country
of
x
up
then
squeeze
yourself
into
meant
for
six
horses
or
men
ride
to
meet
them
those
other
men
knock
them
dead
hack
off
their
heads
live
like
wild
beasts
in
damp
excavations
in
neglect
in
filth
overrun
with
lice
until
we
shall
deem
the
time
has
come
again
for
our
emissary
to
take
a
seat
in
a
parlor
car
and
lift
his
silk
hat
and
in
ornate
rooms
politely
and
aristocratically
dispute
over
the
advantages
which
our
big
merchants
and
manufacturers
are
to
derive
from
the
slaughter
then
as
many
of
you
as
are
not
rotting
under
the
ground
or
hobbling
on
crutches
and
begging
from
door
to
door
may
return
to
your
families
and
may
nay
must
take
up
your
work
again
with
redoubled
energy
more
indefatigably
and
yet
with
fewer
demands
than
before
so
as
to
be
able
to
pay
in
sweat
and
privation
for
the
shoes
that
you
wore
out
in
hundreds
of
marches
and
the
clothes
that
decayed
on
your
bodies
a
fool
he
who
would
sue
for
a
following
in
such
terms
but
fools
they
who
are
the
victims
who
freeze
starve
kill
and
let
themselves
be
killed
just
because
they
have
learned
to
believe
that
this
must
be
so
once
the
mad
dog
war
has
burst
his
chains
and
bitten
the
world
is
this
what
the
wars
were
like
from
which
the
word
war
has
come
down
to
us
did
not
war
use
to
guarantee
booty
were
not
the
mercenaries
led
on
by
hopes
of
a
gay
lawless
life
women
and
ducats
and
steeds
is
this
cowering
under
iron
discipline
this
holding
out
of
your
head
to
be
chopped
off
this
passive
play
with
monsters
that
spill
their
hellish
cauldron
on
you
from
out
of
the
blue
distance
still
war
war
was
the
collision
of
the
superfluous
forces
the
ruffians
of
all
nations
youth
for
whom
the
town
had
grown
too
small
and
the
doublet
too
tight
ventured
out
intoxicated
by
the
play
of
its
own
muscles
and
now
shall
the
same
word
hold
good
when
men
already
anchored
to
house
and
home
are
torn
away
and
whipped
into
the
ranks
and
laid
out
before
the
enemy
and
made
to
wait
defenseless
in
dull
resignation
like
supers
in
this
duel
of
the
munition
industries
is
it
right
to
misuse
the
word
war
as
a
standard
when
it
is
not
courage
and
strength
that
count
but
explosive
bombs
and
the
length
of
range
of
the
guns
and
the
speed
with
which
women
and
children
turn
out
shells
we
used
to
speak
with
horror
of
the
tyrants
of
dark
ages
who
threw
helpless
men
and
women
to
the
lions
and
tigers
but
now
is
there
one
of
us
who
would
not
mention
them
with
respect
in
comparison
with
the
rulers
who
are
at
present
directing
the
struggle
between
men
and
machines
as
though
it
were
a
puppet
show
at
the
end
of
telegraph
wires
and
who
are
animated
by
the
delightful
hope
that
our
supply
of
human
flesh
may
outlast
the
enemy
supply
of
steel
and
iron
no
all
words
coined
before
this
carnage
began
are
too
beautiful
and
too
honest
like
the
word
front
which
i
have
learned
to
abhor
are
you
facing
the
enemy
when
their
artillery
is
hidden
behind
mountains
and
sends
death
over
a
distance
of
a
day
journey
and
when
their
sappers
come
creeping
up
thirty
feet
below
the
surface
and
your
front
is
a
terminal
station
a
little
house
all
shot
up
behind
which
the
tracks
have
been
torn
up
because
the
trains
turn
back
here
after
unloading
their
cargo
of
fresh
sunburned
men
to
call
for
them
again
when
they
have
emerged
from
the
machines
with
torn
limbs
and
faces
covered
with
verdigris
it
was
towards
evening
when
i
got
off
the
train
at
this
terminal
a
bearded
soldier
with
his
right
arm
in
a
sling
was
sitting
on
the
ground
leaning
against
the
iron
railing
around
the
platform
when
he
saw
me
pass
by
quite
spick
and
span
he
stroked
his
right
arm
tenderly
with
his
left
hand
and
threw
me
an
ugly
look
of
hatred
and
called
out
through
clenched
teeth
yes
lieutenant
here
the
place
for
man
salad
am
i
to
forget
the
wicked
grin
that
widened
his
mouth
already
distorted
by
pain
am
i
sick
because
each
time
i
hear
the
word
front
an
echo
man
salad
inevitably
croaks
in
my
ears
or
are
the
others
sick
who
do
not
hear
man
salad
but
swallow
down
the
cowardly
stuff
written
by
our
war
bards
who
try
like
industrious
salesmen
to
make
the
brand
world
war
famous
because
in
reward
they
will
have
the
privilege
of
dashing
about
in
automobiles
like
commanding
generals
instead
of
being
forced
to
face
death
in
muddy
ditches
and
be
bossed
by
a
little
corporal
are
there
really
human
beings
of
flesh
and
blood
who
can
still
take
a
newspaper
in
their
hands
and
not
foam
at
the
mouth
with
rage
can
one
carry
in
one
brain
the
picture
of
wounded
men
lying
exposed
on
slimy
fields
in
the
pouring
rain
slowly
dumbly
bleeding
to
death
and
yet
quietly
read
the
vile
stuff
written
about
perfect
hospital
service
smoothly
running
ambulances
and
elegantly
papered
trenches
with
which
these
fellows
poetize
themselves
free
from
military
service
men
come
home
with
motionless
astonished
eyes
still
reflecting
death
they
walk
about
shyly
like
somnambulists
in
brightly
lighted
streets
in
their
ears
there
still
resound
the
bestial
howls
of
fury
that
they
themselves
bellowed
into
the
hurricane
of
the
drumfire
so
as
to
keep
from
bursting
from
inner
stress
they
come
loaded
down
like
beasts
of
burden
with
horrors
the
astonished
looks
of
bayoneted
dying
foes
on
their
conscience
and
they
do
dare
open
their
mouths
because
everybody
wife
and
child
included
grinds
out
the
same
tune
a
flow
of
curious
questions
about
shells
gas
bombs
and
bayonet
attacks
so
the
days
of
the
furlough
expire
one
by
one
and
the
return
to
death
is
almost
a
deliverance
from
the
shame
of
being
a
coward
in
disguise
among
the
friends
at
home
to
whom
dying
and
killing
have
become
mere
commonplaces
so
be
it
my
dear
doctors
it
is
an
honor
to
be
charged
with
madness
if
those
villains
are
not
called
mad
who
to
save
their
own
necks
have
so
gloriously
hardened
the
people
hearts
and
abolished
pity
and
implanted
pride
in
the
enemy
suffering
instead
of
acting
as
the
one
intermediary
between
distress
and
power
and
arousing
the
conscience
of
the
world
by
going
to
the
most
frequented
places
and
shouting
man
through
a
megaphone
so
loud
and
so
long
that
at
length
all
those
whose
fathers
husbands
brothers
sons
have
gone
to
the
will
be
seized
with
terror
and
all
the
throats
in
the
world
will
be
echo
to
man
if
you
were
here
right
now
dear
doctors
i
could
show
you
my
comrade
summoned
to
this
room
in
the
very
body
by
the
flames
of
hate
against
news
from
the
front
and
against
the
indifference
of
the
hinterland
i
feel
him
standing
behind
my
back
but
his
face
is
lying
on
the
white
sheet
in
front
of
me
like
a
faint
and
my
pen
races
frantically
so
as
to
cover
his
eyes
at
least
with
letters
and
hide
their
reproachful
stare
large
widening
hideously
distorted
his
face
slowly
swelling
rises
from
the
paper
like
the
face
of
jesus
of
the
handkerchief
it
was
just
like
this
that
the
three
war
correspondents
saw
him
lying
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
on
that
midsummer
morning
and
turned
away
involuntarily
with
almost
the
military
exactness
of
soldiers
at
a
right
about
face
their
visit
was
meant
for
i
was
to
furnish
them
with
carriage
and
horses
because
the
automobile
that
was
to
have
darted
them
through
the
danger
zone
was
lying
on
the
road
to
goerz
with
a
broken
axle
charming
gentlemen
in
wonderfully
breeches
and
traveling
caps
looking
as
if
they
had
stepped
out
of
a
sherlock
holmes
motion
picture
they
offered
to
carry
letters
back
and
deliver
messages
and
they
found
everything
on
my
place
perfectly
fascinating
and
laughed
heartily
at
my
mattress
of
willow
twigs
and
were
particularly
grateful
when
the
carriage
stood
ready
to
carry
them
off
before
the
daily
bombardment
of
the
italians
began
on
driving
out
of
the
woods
they
had
to
pass
the
wounded
man
again
with
the
hideously
disfigured
face
he
was
crouching
on
the
meadow
but
this
time
they
did
not
see
him
as
if
at
command
they
turned
their
heads
the
other
way
and
with
animated
gestures
viewed
the
damage
done
by
an
air
raid
the
day
before
as
though
they
were
already
sitting
over
a
table
in
a
i
lost
my
breath
as
though
i
had
run
a
long
distance
the
place
where
i
stood
suddenly
seemed
strange
and
altered
was
that
the
same
piece
of
woods
into
which
shells
had
so
often
come
crashing
which
the
huge
caproni
planes
had
circled
about
with
wings
like
vultures
shedding
bombs
while
our
machine
guns
lashed
the
leaves
with
a
hailstorm
of
shot
was
it
out
of
piece
of
woods
that
three
men
had
just
driven
off
healthy
unscathed
gaily
waving
their
caps
where
was
the
wall
that
held
us
others
imprisoned
under
the
cracking
branches
was
there
not
a
door
that
opened
only
to
let
out
pale
sunken
cheeks
feverish
eyes
or
mangled
limbs
the
carriage
rolled
lightly
over
the
field
trampled
down
brown
and
the
one
thing
missing
to
make
it
the
perfect
picture
of
a
pleasure
trip
was
the
brilliant
red
of
a
baedeker
those
men
were
riding
back
home
to
wife
and
child
perhaps
a
painful
pulling
and
tugging
as
though
my
eyes
were
caught
to
the
carriage
wheels
then
my
body
rebounded
as
if
torn
off
back
into
emptiness
and
at
that
moment
just
when
my
soul
was
as
if
ploughed
up
by
the
carriage
and
laid
bare
and
defenseless
by
yearning
at
that
moment
the
experience
sprang
upon
me
with
one
dreadful
leap
one
single
bite
incurable
for
the
rest
of
my
life
unsuspecting
i
crossed
over
to
the
wounded
man
upon
whom
the
three
had
so
unceremoniously
turned
their
backs
as
though
he
did
not
also
belong
to
the
interesting
museum
of
shell
holes
that
they
had
come
to
inspect
he
was
cowering
near
the
dirty
ragged
little
red
cross
flag
with
his
head
between
his
knees
and
did
not
hear
me
come
up
behind
him
lay
the
brown
spot
which
stood
out
from
the
green
still
left
on
the
field
like
a
circus
ring
the
wounded
soldiers
who
gathered
here
every
morning
at
dawn
to
be
driven
to
the
field
hospital
in
the
wagons
that
brought
us
ammunition
had
rubbed
this
spot
in
like
a
favorite
corner
of
a
sofa
how
many
i
had
seen
crouching
there
like
that
for
ten
often
twelve
hours
when
the
wagons
had
left
too
early
or
had
been
overcrowded
or
after
violent
fighting
had
stood
waiting
in
line
at
the
munitions
depot
behind
the
lines
happy
fellows
some
of
them
with
broken
arms
or
legs
the
war
slang
a
shot
on
their
pale
yet
laughing
lips
enviously
ogled
by
the
men
with
slight
wounds
or
the
men
sick
with
typhoid
fever
who
would
all
gladly
have
sacrificed
a
thousand
dollars
and
a
limb
into
the
bargain
for
the
same
certainty
of
not
having
to
return
to
the
front
again
how
many
i
had
seen
rolling
on
the
ground
biting
into
the
earth
in
their
agony
how
many
in
the
pouring
rain
half
buried
already
in
the
mud
their
bodies
ripped
open
groaning
and
whimpering
and
outbellowing
the
storm
this
man
seemed
to
be
only
slightly
hurt
in
the
right
leg
the
blood
had
oozed
out
on
one
spot
through
the
hastily
made
bandage
so
i
offered
him
my
package
besides
cognac
and
cigarettes
but
he
did
not
move
it
was
not
until
i
laid
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
that
he
raised
his
head
and
the
face
he
showed
me
threw
me
back
like
a
blow
on
the
chest
his
mouth
and
nose
had
come
apart
and
crept
like
a
thick
vine
up
his
right
cheek
which
was
no
longer
a
cheek
a
chunk
of
bluish
red
flesh
swelled
up
there
covered
by
skin
stretched
to
bursting
and
shining
from
being
drawn
so
tight
the
whole
right
side
of
his
face
seemed
more
like
an
exotic
fruit
than
a
human
countenance
while
from
the
left
side
from
out
of
grey
twitching
misery
a
sad
frightened
eye
looked
up
at
me
violent
terror
slung
itself
round
my
neck
like
a
lasso
what
was
it
such
a
frightful
thing
as
that
even
this
field
this
to
the
beyond
had
never
witnessed
before
even
the
awful
recollection
of
another
wounded
man
who
had
stood
at
this
same
spot
a
few
days
before
his
hands
looking
as
though
they
were
modeling
something
while
in
actuality
they
were
carefully
holding
his
own
entrails
even
that
hideous
recollection
faded
before
the
sight
of
this
janus
head
all
peace
all
gentle
humanity
on
one
side
all
war
all
distorted
image
of
fiendish
hatred
on
the
other
side
shrapnel
i
stammered
timidly
the
answer
was
confused
all
i
could
get
out
of
it
was
that
a
dumdum
bullet
had
smashed
his
right
shinbone
but
what
was
that
he
kept
mumbling
about
a
hook
each
time
his
hand
trembled
up
to
his
glowing
cheek
i
could
not
understand
him
for
the
thing
he
had
gone
through
still
seethed
in
his
veins
so
violently
that
he
spoke
as
though
it
were
just
then
happening
and
i
were
witnessing
it
his
peasant
mind
could
not
comprehend
that
there
were
people
who
had
not
seen
or
heard
of
the
tremendous
misery
of
the
last
hours
he
had
gone
through
so
it
was
more
by
that
i
gradually
pieced
together
his
story
from
unfinished
sentences
coarse
oaths
and
groans
for
a
whole
night
after
a
repulsed
attack
on
the
enemy
trench
he
had
lain
with
a
broken
leg
unconscious
near
our
own
wire
entanglements
at
dawn
they
threw
out
the
iron
grappling
hook
for
him
with
which
they
pull
over
into
the
trench
the
corpses
of
friend
and
foe
so
as
to
be
able
to
bury
them
unceremoniously
before
the
sun
of
goerz
has
a
chance
to
do
its
work
with
this
hook
dipped
in
hundreds
of
corpses
a
dunce
god
damn
him
had
torn
his
cheek
open
before
a
more
skilful
hand
caught
hold
of
it
and
got
him
over
safely
and
now
he
asked
humbly
to
be
taken
away
to
the
hospital
quickly
because
he
was
worried
about
his
leg
and
being
a
crippled
beggar
the
rest
of
his
life
i
ran
off
as
though
mad
dogs
were
at
my
heels
over
rocks
and
roots
through
the
woods
to
the
next
detachment
in
vain
in
the
whole
woods
there
was
not
a
single
vehicle
to
be
found
i
had
given
up
the
last
one
to
those
three
war
correspondents
why
had
i
not
asked
them
to
take
the
one
wounded
man
lying
on
the
field
along
with
them
and
leave
him
at
the
hospital
that
they
would
pass
why
had
they
themselves
not
thought
of
doing
their
human
duty
why
i
clenched
my
fists
in
impotent
fury
and
caught
myself
reaching
for
my
revolver
as
though
i
could
still
shoot
those
gay
sparks
in
their
carriage
breathless
overheated
from
the
long
race
i
tottered
back
my
knees
trembling
the
whole
way
i
felt
utterly
broken
as
though
i
were
carrying
on
my
shoulders
a
picture
weighing
a
ton
of
men
who
for
sport
angle
for
human
carrion
an
odd
choking
and
tickling
came
into
my
throat
a
sensation
i
had
not
known
since
childhood
when
back
at
my
post
again
i
had
to
listen
to
the
low
whimpering
of
the
helpless
man
he
was
no
longer
alone
in
my
absence
a
little
band
of
slightly
wounded
men
had
joined
him
peering
between
the
tree
trunks
i
saw
them
sitting
in
a
circle
on
the
field
while
the
man
who
had
been
hooked
was
hopping
about
holding
on
to
his
injured
leg
and
tossing
his
head
from
one
shoulder
to
the
other
towards
noon
i
sent
my
corporals
in
search
of
a
vehicle
promising
them
a
princely
reward
while
i
ran
to
the
field
again
with
my
whisky
flask
he
was
no
longer
dancing
about
he
was
kneeling
in
the
center
of
the
circle
of
wounded
men
his
body
bent
over
rolling
his
head
on
the
ground
as
though
it
were
a
thing
apart
from
himself
suddenly
he
jumped
up
with
such
a
yell
of
fury
that
a
frightened
murmur
came
even
from
the
line
of
wounded
men
who
had
been
sitting
there
indifferent
sunk
in
their
own
suffering
that
was
no
longer
anything
human
the
man
skin
could
not
stand
any
more
stretching
and
had
burst
the
broad
splits
ran
apart
like
the
lines
of
a
compass
and
in
the
middle
the
raw
flesh
glowed
and
gushed
out
and
he
yelled
he
hammered
with
his
fist
on
the
enormous
purplish
lump
until
he
fell
to
his
knees
again
moaning
under
the
blows
of
his
own
hand
it
was
dark
already
when
at
last
they
came
and
carted
him
away
and
when
the
night
slowly
wove
its
web
of
mist
in
the
woods
and
i
lay
wrapped
in
a
mound
of
blankets
the
only
one
who
was
still
awake
in
the
throng
of
black
that
moved
closer
together
in
the
darkness
there
he
was
back
again
standing
up
stiff
in
the
moonlight
his
tortured
cheek
huge
as
a
pumpkin
shining
blue
against
the
black
shadows
of
the
trees
it
glimmered
like
a
now
here
now
there
night
after
night
it
shone
into
every
dream
so
that
i
forced
my
eyelids
open
with
my
fingers
until
after
ten
frightful
nights
my
body
broke
down
and
was
carried
a
shrieking
convulsed
heap
to
the
same
hospital
in
which
he
had
succumbed
to
and
now
i
am
a
madman
you
can
read
it
black
on
white
on
the
placard
at
the
head
of
my
bed
they
pat
me
on
the
back
soothingly
like
a
shying
horse
when
i
flare
up
and
ask
to
be
let
out
of
this
place
in
which
should
be
shut
up
but
the
others
are
free
from
my
window
i
can
look
over
the
garden
wall
into
the
street
and
see
them
hurrying
along
raising
their
hats
shaking
hands
and
crowding
in
front
of
the
latest
bulletin
i
see
women
and
girls
dressed
coquettishly
tripping
along
with
pride
shining
in
their
eyes
beside
men
whom
a
cross
on
the
breast
brands
as
murderers
i
see
widows
in
long
black
veils
still
patient
i
see
lads
with
flowers
stuck
in
their
helmets
ready
to
leave
for
the
war
and
not
one
of
them
rebels
not
one
of
them
sees
bruised
mangled
men
cowering
in
dark
corners
men
ripped
apart
by
grappling
hooks
men
with
their
entrails
gushing
out
and
men
with
blue
shining
cheeks
they
go
by
under
my
window
gesticulating
enthusiastic
because
the
enthusiastic
phrases
arrive
coined
fresh
every
day
from
the
mint
and
each
person
feels
sheltered
and
enveloped
in
a
warmth
of
assent
if
the
phrases
ring
clear
from
his
lips
i
know
that
they
keep
quiet
even
when
they
would
like
to
speak
to
cry
out
to
scream
i
know
that
they
hunt
down
slackers
and
have
no
word
of
abuse
for
those
who
are
a
thousand
times
worse
cowards
those
who
clearly
recognise
the
utter
senselessness
of
this
butchery
of
millions
yet
will
not
open
their
mouths
for
fear
of
the
censure
of
the
thoughtless
crowd
from
my
window
i
can
see
the
whole
globe
spinning
round
like
a
crazy
whirligig
whipped
on
by
haughty
lords
in
cunning
calculation
and
by
venal
servants
in
sneaking
submissiveness
i
see
the
whole
pack
the
bawlers
who
are
too
empty
and
too
lazy
to
develop
their
own
selves
and
want
to
puff
themselves
with
the
glittering
praise
meant
for
their
herd
the
scoundrels
who
are
protected
by
the
masses
carried
by
them
and
fed
by
them
and
who
look
up
sanctimoniously
to
a
bogy
of
their
own
invention
and
hammer
that
bogy
into
the
conscience
of
millions
of
good
men
until
the
mass
has
been
forged
that
has
neither
heart
nor
brain
but
only
fury
and
blind
faith
i
see
the
whole
game
proceeding
madly
in
blood
and
agony
i
see
the
spectators
going
by
indifferently
and
i
am
called
a
madman
when
i
raise
the
window
to
call
down
to
them
that
the
sons
they
have
born
and
bred
the
men
they
have
loved
are
being
chased
like
wild
animals
are
being
butchered
like
cattle
those
fools
down
there
who
for
the
sake
of
respectable
condolence
calls
for
a
neighbor
eyes
raised
heavenward
in
sympathy
sacrificed
the
splendor
and
warmth
of
their
lives
who
threw
their
flesh
and
blood
into
the
barbed
wire
entanglements
to
rot
as
carrion
on
the
fields
or
be
hooked
in
with
grappling
hooks
who
have
no
other
consolation
than
that
the
enemy
have
had
the
same
done
to
them
those
fools
remain
free
and
in
their
despicable
vanity
and
wicked
patience
they
may
daily
shove
fresh
hecatombs
out
to
the
cannons
but
i
must
stay
here
impotent
left
alone
with
the
relentless
comrade
that
my
conscience
gives
birth
to
over
again
every
day
i
stand
at
my
window
and
between
me
and
the
street
lie
piled
high
the
bodies
of
the
many
i
saw
bleeding
and
i
stand
here
powerless
because
the
revolver
that
was
given
me
to
shoot
down
poor
homesick
devils
forced
into
a
uniform
by
iron
necessity
has
been
taken
from
me
out
of
fear
that
i
might
dislodge
a
few
mass
murderers
from
their
security
and
send
them
as
a
warning
example
down
to
their
victims
so
i
must
stay
here
as
a
seer
over
the
blind
behind
iron
gratings
and
all
i
can
do
is
consign
these
leaves
to
the
wind
every
day
write
it
all
down
again
and
keep
scattering
the
pages
out
on
the
street
i
will
write
indefatigably
i
will
sow
the
whole
world
with
my
pages
until
the
seed
shall
sprout
in
every
heart
until
every
bedroom
will
be
entered
by
a
blue
apparition
a
dear
dead
one
showing
his
wounds
and
at
last
at
last
the
glorious
song
of
the
world
redemption
will
resound
under
my
window
the
wrathful
cry
shouted
by
a
million
throats
man
a
hero
death
the
staff
physician
had
not
understood
he
shook
his
head
vexed
and
looked
questioningly
over
the
rims
of
his
glasses
at
his
assistant
but
his
assistant
had
not
understood
either
and
was
embarrassed
and
stood
stiffly
without
saying
anything
the
only
one
who
seemed
to
have
any
clue
at
all
to
the
man
ravings
was
his
orderly
for
two
tears
glistened
on
the
upturned
ends
of
his
waxed
mustache
but
the
orderly
spoke
nothing
but
hungarian
and
the
staff
physician
turned
away
with
a
muttered
blooming
idiot
followed
by
his
assistant
he
made
his
way
toward
the
operating
room
panting
and
perspiring
the
huge
ball
of
cotton
inside
of
which
according
to
the
placard
hanging
at
the
top
of
the
bed
was
hidden
the
head
of
first
lieutenant
of
the
reserves
otto
kadar
of
the
th
regiment
of
field
artillery
sank
back
on
the
pillow
and
miska
seated
himself
again
on
his
knapsack
snuffed
up
his
tears
put
his
head
between
his
big
unwashed
hands
and
speculated
despairingly
about
his
future
for
it
was
plain
that
his
lieutenant
could
not
last
much
longer
miska
knew
what
was
hidden
in
the
huge
cotton
ball
he
had
seen
the
crushed
skull
and
the
horrible
grey
mess
under
the
bloody
splinters
which
were
the
brains
of
his
poor
lieutenant
who
had
been
such
a
good
man
and
kind
superior
miska
could
not
hope
for
such
wonderful
luck
a
second
time
you
did
come
across
such
a
master
twice
in
your
life
the
many
many
slices
of
salami
that
the
lieutenant
always
had
given
him
from
his
own
store
of
provisions
the
gentle
cordial
words
that
miska
had
heard
him
whisper
to
every
wounded
man
all
the
memories
of
the
long
bloody
months
he
had
gone
through
dully
beside
his
master
almost
like
a
comrade
rose
to
his
mind
he
felt
dreadfully
sorry
for
himself
the
good
fellow
did
in
his
infinite
defenselessness
against
the
huge
war
machine
into
which
he
would
now
be
thrown
again
without
the
sure
support
of
his
kind
lieutenant
next
to
him
his
broad
peasant
head
between
his
hands
he
crouched
like
a
dog
at
the
feet
of
his
dying
master
and
the
tears
rolled
gently
down
his
cheeks
and
stuck
one
by
one
on
the
ends
of
his
mustache
glued
with
dust
and
pomade
it
was
not
quite
clear
to
miska
either
just
why
the
poor
lieutenant
kept
clamoring
so
frightfully
for
his
all
he
knew
was
that
the
officers
had
been
sitting
under
cover
listening
to
the
rakoczy
march
on
the
phonograph
when
suddenly
that
accursed
shell
burst
upon
them
and
everything
disappeared
in
smoke
and
earth
he
himself
had
been
knocked
unconscious
by
a
heavy
board
which
came
out
of
a
clear
sky
and
hit
him
on
the
back
he
had
fallen
flat
and
it
was
an
eternity
before
he
got
his
breath
back
again
then
then
miska
recollections
of
things
after
this
were
a
bit
hazy
then
he
remembered
an
indescribable
heap
of
splintered
boards
and
fallen
beams
a
hash
of
rags
cement
earth
human
limbs
and
quantities
of
blood
and
then
then
he
remembered
young
meltzar
meltzar
was
still
sitting
upright
with
his
back
against
the
remains
of
the
wall
and
the
record
that
had
just
played
the
rakoczy
march
and
had
miraculously
remained
whole
was
perched
on
the
place
where
his
head
belonged
but
his
head
was
not
there
it
was
gone
completely
gone
while
the
black
record
remained
also
leaning
against
the
wall
directly
on
top
of
the
bloodsoaked
collar
it
was
awful
not
one
of
the
soldiers
had
dared
touch
the
upright
body
with
the
record
exactly
like
a
head
on
its
neck
brrr
a
cold
shiver
ran
down
miska
back
at
the
recollection
and
his
heart
stopped
beating
in
fright
when
just
at
that
moment
the
lieutenant
again
began
to
scream
phonograph
only
a
phonograph
miska
jumped
up
and
saw
the
huge
ball
of
cotton
lift
itself
with
an
effort
from
the
pillow
and
his
officer
one
remaining
eye
fix
greedily
upon
some
invisible
object
he
stood
there
ashamed
as
though
guilty
of
a
crime
when
indignant
glances
were
darted
at
him
from
the
other
beds
in
the
ward
this
is
unbearable
cried
a
major
who
had
been
severely
wounded
from
the
other
end
of
the
long
ward
carry
the
man
out
but
the
major
spoke
german
and
miska
was
more
than
ever
at
sea
he
wiped
the
sweat
of
anguish
from
his
brow
and
explained
to
a
lieutenant
in
the
next
bed
since
his
master
could
not
hear
what
he
said
anyhow
that
the
phonograph
had
been
broken
broken
into
a
thousand
pieces
else
he
would
never
have
left
it
there
but
would
surely
have
brought
it
along
as
he
had
brought
everything
else
belonging
to
his
lieutenant
that
he
had
managed
to
find
no
one
answered
him
as
at
a
word
of
command
each
one
of
the
officers
the
whole
length
of
the
ward
stuck
his
head
under
his
pillow
and
pulled
the
covers
over
his
ears
so
as
not
to
hear
that
horrible
gurgling
laugh
which
changed
into
a
howl
or
into
infuriated
cries
for
the
phonograph
the
old
major
even
wrapped
his
cloak
around
his
head
like
a
turban
lieutenant
i
beg
pardon
lieutenant
miska
begged
and
very
very
gently
stroked
his
master
quivering
knees
with
his
big
hard
palms
but
lieutenant
kadar
heard
him
not
neither
did
he
feel
the
heavy
hand
resting
on
his
knees
for
opposite
him
young
meltzar
was
still
sitting
with
a
flat
black
round
head
on
his
neck
on
which
the
rakoczy
march
was
ingraved
in
spirals
and
all
at
once
the
officer
realized
that
for
the
past
six
months
he
had
done
poor
meltzar
a
grievous
injustice
how
could
the
poor
fellow
help
his
stupidity
how
could
he
help
his
silly
patriotic
talk
how
could
he
possibly
have
had
sensible
ideas
with
a
record
for
a
head
poor
meltzar
lieutenant
kadar
simply
could
not
understand
why
it
was
that
six
months
before
right
away
when
young
meltzar
announced
his
entrance
into
the
battery
he
had
not
guessed
what
they
had
done
to
the
boy
in
the
hinterland
they
had
given
him
a
different
head
they
had
unscrewed
the
handsome
fair
young
head
of
a
lad
of
eighteen
and
in
its
place
put
a
black
disc
which
could
do
nothing
but
squeak
the
rakoczy
march
that
had
now
been
proved
how
the
boy
must
have
suffered
whenever
his
superior
officer
his
senior
by
twenty
years
inflicted
long
sermons
on
him
about
humanity
with
the
flat
round
disc
that
they
had
put
on
him
he
of
course
could
not
comprehend
that
the
italian
soldiers
being
led
past
the
battery
reeking
with
blood
and
in
rags
would
also
much
rather
have
stayed
at
home
if
a
bulletin
on
the
street
corner
had
not
forced
them
to
leave
their
homes
immediately
just
as
the
mobilization
in
hungary
had
forced
the
hungarian
gunners
to
leave
their
homes
now
for
the
first
time
lieutenant
kadar
comprehended
the
young
unbending
resistance
to
him
now
at
last
he
realized
why
this
boy
who
could
have
been
his
son
had
so
completely
ignored
his
wisest
kindest
admonitions
and
explanations
and
had
always
responded
by
whistling
the
rakoczy
march
through
clenched
teeth
and
hissing
the
stereotyped
fulmination
the
dogs
ought
to
be
shot
to
pieces
so
then
it
was
not
because
of
his
being
young
and
stupid
that
meltzar
had
behaved
as
he
did
not
because
he
had
come
direct
from
the
military
academy
to
the
trenches
the
phonograph
record
was
to
blame
the
phonograph
record
lieutenant
kadar
felt
his
veins
swell
up
like
ropes
and
his
blood
pound
on
his
temples
like
blows
on
an
anvil
so
great
was
his
wrath
against
the
wrongdoers
who
had
treacherously
unscrewed
poor
meltzar
lovely
young
head
from
his
body
and
this
was
the
most
gruesome
as
he
now
thought
of
his
subordinates
and
he
saw
them
all
going
about
exactly
like
poor
meltzar
without
heads
on
their
bodies
he
shut
his
eyes
and
tried
to
recall
the
looks
of
his
gunners
in
vain
not
a
single
face
rose
before
his
mind
eye
he
had
spent
months
and
months
among
those
men
and
had
not
discovered
until
that
moment
that
not
one
of
them
had
a
head
on
his
shoulders
otherwise
he
would
surely
have
remembered
whether
his
gunner
had
a
mustache
or
not
and
whether
the
artillery
captain
was
light
or
dark
no
nothing
stuck
in
his
mind
nothing
but
phonograph
records
hideous
black
round
plates
lying
on
bloody
blouses
the
whole
region
of
the
isonzo
suddenly
lay
spread
out
way
below
him
like
a
huge
map
such
as
he
had
often
seen
in
illustrated
papers
the
silver
ribbon
of
the
river
wound
in
and
out
among
hills
and
coppices
and
lieutenant
kadar
soared
high
above
the
welter
down
below
without
motor
or
aeroplane
but
borne
along
merely
by
his
own
outspread
arms
and
everywhere
he
looked
on
every
hill
and
in
every
hollow
he
saw
the
horns
of
innumerable
growing
out
of
the
ground
thousands
upon
thousands
of
those
familiar
cornucopias
of
bright
lacquer
with
gilt
edges
pointed
their
open
mouths
up
at
him
and
each
one
was
the
center
of
a
swarming
of
busy
gunners
carrying
shot
and
shell
and
now
lieutenant
kadar
saw
it
very
distinctly
all
the
men
had
records
on
their
necks
like
young
meltzar
not
a
single
one
carried
his
own
head
but
when
the
shells
burst
with
a
howl
from
the
lacquered
horns
and
flew
straight
into
an
then
the
flat
black
discs
broke
apart
and
at
the
very
same
instant
changed
back
into
real
heads
from
his
height
lieutenant
kadar
saw
the
brains
gush
out
of
the
shattered
discs
and
the
surfaces
turn
on
the
second
into
ashen
agonized
human
countenances
everything
seemed
to
be
revealed
now
in
one
stroke
to
the
dying
lieutenant
all
the
secrets
of
the
war
all
the
problems
he
had
brooded
over
for
many
months
past
so
he
had
the
key
to
the
riddle
these
people
evidently
did
not
get
their
heads
back
until
they
were
about
to
die
somewhere
somewhere
far
back
far
back
of
the
lines
their
heads
had
been
unscrewed
and
replaced
by
records
that
could
do
nothing
but
play
the
rakoczy
march
prepared
in
this
fashion
they
had
been
jammed
into
the
trains
and
sent
to
the
front
like
poor
meltzar
like
himself
like
all
of
them
in
a
fury
of
anger
the
ball
of
cotton
tossed
itself
up
again
with
a
jerk
lieutenant
kadar
wanted
to
jump
out
of
bed
and
reveal
the
secret
to
his
men
and
urge
them
to
insist
upon
having
their
heads
back
again
he
wanted
to
whisper
the
secret
to
each
individual
along
the
entire
front
from
plava
all
the
way
down
to
the
sea
he
wanted
to
tell
it
to
each
gunner
each
soldier
in
the
infantry
and
even
to
the
italians
over
there
he
even
wanted
to
tell
it
to
the
italians
the
italians
too
had
had
records
screwed
on
to
their
necks
and
they
should
go
back
home
too
back
to
verona
to
venice
to
naples
where
their
heads
lay
piled
up
in
the
for
safekeeping
until
the
war
was
over
lieutenant
kadar
wanted
to
run
from
one
man
to
another
so
as
to
help
each
individual
to
recover
his
head
whether
friend
or
foe
but
all
at
once
he
noticed
he
could
not
walk
and
he
was
soaring
any
more
either
heavy
iron
weights
clamped
his
feet
down
to
the
bed
to
keep
him
from
revealing
the
great
secret
well
then
he
would
shout
it
out
in
a
roar
in
a
voice
supernaturally
loud
that
would
sound
above
the
bursting
of
the
shells
and
the
blare
of
trumpets
on
the
day
of
judgment
and
proclaim
the
truth
from
plava
to
trieste
even
into
the
tyrol
he
would
shout
as
no
man
had
ever
shouted
before
phonograph
bring
the
heads
phonograph
here
his
voice
suddenly
broke
with
a
gurgling
sound
of
agony
right
in
the
midst
of
his
message
of
salvation
it
hurt
too
much
he
could
not
shout
he
felt
as
though
at
each
word
a
sharp
needle
went
deep
into
his
brain
a
needle
of
course
how
could
he
have
forgotten
it
his
head
had
been
screwed
off
too
he
wore
a
record
on
his
neck
too
like
all
the
others
when
he
tried
to
say
something
the
needle
stuck
itself
into
his
skull
and
ran
mercilessly
along
all
the
coils
of
his
brain
no
he
could
not
bear
it
he
rather
keep
quiet
keep
the
secret
to
himself
only
not
to
feel
that
pain
that
maddening
pain
in
his
head
but
the
machine
ran
on
lieutenant
kadar
grabbed
his
head
with
both
hands
and
dug
his
nails
deep
into
his
temples
if
he
did
stop
that
thing
in
time
from
going
round
and
round
then
his
revolving
head
would
certainly
break
his
neck
in
a
few
seconds
icy
drops
of
anguish
flowed
from
all
his
pores
miska
he
yelled
in
the
extreme
of
his
distress
but
miska
did
not
know
what
to
do
the
record
kept
on
revolving
and
joyously
thrummed
the
rakoczy
march
all
the
sinews
in
the
lieutenant
body
grew
tense
again
and
again
he
felt
his
head
slip
from
between
his
hands
his
spine
was
already
rising
before
his
eyes
with
a
last
frantic
effort
he
tried
once
more
to
get
his
hands
inside
the
bandages
and
press
his
head
forward
then
one
more
dreadful
gnashing
of
his
teeth
and
one
more
horrible
groan
and
the
long
ward
was
at
length
as
silent
as
an
empty
church
when
the
assistant
returned
from
the
miska
whining
informed
him
from
afar
that
another
cot
in
the
division
was
now
vacant
the
impatient
old
major
quite
needlessly
beckoned
him
to
his
side
and
announced
in
a
loud
voice
so
that
all
the
gentlemen
could
hear
the
poor
devil
there
has
at
last
come
to
the
end
of
his
sufferings
then
he
added
in
a
voice
vibrating
with
respect
he
died
like
a
true
hungarian
singing
the
rakoczy
march
vi
home
again
at
last
the
lake
gleamed
through
the
leaves
and
the
familiar
grey
chalk
mountains
emerged
into
view
reaching
out
across
the
railroad
embankment
as
with
threatening
fingers
deep
down
into
the
water
there
beyond
the
smoky
black
opening
of
the
short
tunnel
the
church
steeple
and
a
corner
of
the
castle
peeped
for
an
instant
above
the
grove
john
bogdán
leaned
way
out
of
the
train
window
and
looked
at
everything
with
greedy
eyes
like
a
man
going
over
the
inventory
of
his
possessions
all
tense
and
distrustful
for
fear
something
may
have
been
lost
in
his
absence
as
each
group
of
trees
for
which
he
waited
darted
by
he
gave
a
satisfied
nod
measuring
the
correctness
of
the
landscape
by
the
picture
of
it
that
he
carried
fairly
seared
in
his
memory
everything
agreed
every
milestone
on
the
highroad
now
running
parallel
to
the
railroad
tracks
stood
on
the
right
spot
there
the
flash
of
the
flaming
red
copper
beech
at
which
the
horses
always
shied
and
once
came
within
an
ace
of
upsetting
the
carriage
john
bogdán
drew
a
deep
heavy
sigh
fished
a
small
mirror
out
of
his
pocket
and
gave
his
face
a
final
scrutiny
before
leaving
the
train
at
each
station
his
face
seemed
to
grow
uglier
the
right
side
was
not
so
bad
a
bit
of
his
mustache
still
remained
and
his
right
cheek
was
fairly
smooth
except
for
the
gash
at
the
corner
of
his
mouth
which
had
not
healed
properly
but
the
left
side
he
had
let
those
damned
city
folk
tell
him
a
whole
lot
of
nonsense
about
the
left
side
of
his
face
a
bunch
of
damned
scoundrels
they
were
bent
upon
making
fools
of
poor
peasants
in
wartime
just
the
same
as
in
peacetime
all
of
them
the
great
doctor
as
well
as
the
fine
ladies
in
their
dazzling
white
gowns
and
with
their
silly
affected
talk
heaven
knows
it
was
no
great
trick
to
bamboozle
a
simple
coachman
who
had
managed
with
only
the
greatest
pains
to
learn
a
bit
of
reading
and
writing
they
had
smiled
and
simpered
at
him
and
were
so
nice
and
had
promised
him
such
a
paradise
and
now
here
he
was
helpless
left
all
alone
to
himself
a
lost
man
with
a
furious
curse
he
tore
off
his
hat
and
threw
it
on
the
seat
was
that
the
face
of
a
human
being
was
it
permitted
to
do
such
a
thing
to
a
man
his
nose
looked
like
a
patchwork
of
small
dice
of
different
colors
his
mouth
was
awry
and
the
whole
left
cheek
was
like
a
piece
of
bloated
raw
meat
red
and
with
deep
scars
ugh
how
ugly
a
fright
and
besides
instead
of
a
cheekbone
he
had
a
long
hollow
deep
enough
to
hold
a
man
finger
and
it
was
for
this
he
had
let
himself
be
tortured
so
for
this
he
had
let
himself
be
enticed
seventeen
times
like
a
patient
sheep
into
that
confounded
room
with
the
glass
walls
and
the
shining
instruments
a
shudder
ran
down
his
back
at
the
recollection
of
the
tortures
he
had
gone
through
with
clenched
teeth
just
to
look
like
a
human
being
again
and
be
able
to
go
back
home
to
his
bride
and
now
he
home
the
train
pulled
out
of
the
tunnel
the
whistle
blew
and
the
dwarf
acacias
in
front
of
the
hut
sent
a
greeting
through
the
window
grimly
john
bogdán
dragged
his
heavy
bag
through
the
train
corridor
descended
the
steps
hesitatingly
and
stood
there
at
a
loss
looking
around
for
help
as
the
train
rolled
on
behind
his
back
he
took
out
his
large
flowered
handkerchief
and
wiped
off
the
heavy
beads
of
perspiration
from
his
forehead
what
was
he
to
do
now
why
had
he
come
here
at
all
now
that
he
had
finally
set
foot
again
on
the
home
soil
for
which
he
had
yearned
so
ardently
a
great
longing
came
over
him
for
the
hospital
which
he
had
left
that
very
morning
only
a
few
hours
before
full
of
rejoicing
he
thought
of
the
long
ward
with
all
those
men
wrapped
in
bandages
who
limped
and
hobbled
lame
blind
or
disfigured
there
nobody
was
revolted
by
the
sight
of
his
mutilated
face
no
indeed
on
the
contrary
most
of
them
envied
him
he
was
at
least
capable
of
going
back
to
work
his
arms
and
legs
were
sound
and
his
right
eye
was
perfect
many
would
have
been
ready
to
exchange
places
with
him
some
had
begrudged
him
his
lot
and
said
it
was
wrong
for
the
government
to
have
granted
him
a
pension
on
account
of
losing
his
left
eye
one
eye
and
a
face
a
little
scratched
up
what
was
that
compared
with
a
wooden
leg
a
crippled
arm
or
a
perforated
lung
which
wheezed
and
rattled
like
a
poor
machine
at
the
slightest
exertion
among
the
many
cripples
in
the
hospital
john
bogdán
was
looked
upon
as
a
lucky
devil
a
celebrity
everybody
knew
his
story
the
visitors
to
the
hospital
wanted
first
of
all
to
see
the
man
who
had
had
himself
operated
on
seventeen
times
and
the
skin
cut
away
in
bands
from
his
back
his
chest
and
his
thighs
after
each
operation
as
soon
as
the
bandages
were
removed
the
door
to
his
ward
never
remained
shut
a
hundred
opinions
were
pronounced
and
every
newcomer
was
given
a
detailed
description
of
how
terrible
his
face
had
been
before
the
few
men
who
had
shared
bogdán
room
with
him
from
the
start
described
the
former
awfulness
of
his
face
with
a
sort
of
pride
as
though
they
had
taken
part
in
the
successful
operations
thus
john
bogdán
had
gradually
become
almost
vain
of
his
shocking
mutilation
and
the
progress
of
the
beautifying
process
and
when
he
left
the
hospital
it
was
with
the
expectation
of
being
admired
as
a
sensation
in
his
village
and
now
alone
in
the
world
with
no
relatives
to
go
to
with
nothing
but
his
knapsack
and
his
little
trunk
the
brilliant
sunlight
of
the
hungarian
plain
country
flooding
down
on
him
and
the
village
stretching
away
to
a
distance
before
him
john
bogdán
suddenly
felt
himself
a
prey
to
timidity
to
a
terror
that
he
had
not
known
amid
the
bursting
of
the
shells
the
most
violent
charges
the
most
ferocious
encounters
his
inert
peasant
intellect
his
nature
crudely
compounded
of
wilfulness
and
vanity
had
always
been
a
stranger
to
reflections
yet
an
instinctive
misgiving
the
sense
of
distrust
and
hostility
that
overwhelmed
him
told
him
plainly
enough
that
he
was
about
to
face
disillusionment
and
mortification
such
as
he
had
not
dreamed
of
in
the
hospital
he
lifted
his
luggage
to
his
back
dejectedly
and
walked
toward
the
exit
with
hesitating
steps
there
in
the
shadow
of
the
dusty
acacias
that
he
had
seen
grow
up
and
that
had
seen
him
grow
up
he
felt
himself
confronted
with
his
former
self
with
the
handsome
john
bogdán
who
was
known
in
the
village
as
the
smart
coachman
of
the
manor
a
lot
of
good
were
all
the
operations
and
patchwork
now
the
thing
now
was
the
painful
contrast
between
the
forward
lad
who
on
this
spot
had
sung
out
a
last
hoarse
farewell
to
his
sweetheart
marcsa
on
the
first
day
of
mobilization
and
the
disfigured
creature
who
was
standing
in
front
of
the
same
railroad
station
with
one
eye
gone
a
shattered
cheekbone
a
cheek
and
half
a
nose
embittered
and
cast
down
as
if
it
were
only
that
morning
that
he
had
met
with
the
misfortune
at
the
small
grille
gate
stood
the
wife
of
the
kovacs
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
kovacs
himself
had
been
somewhere
on
the
russian
front
talking
and
holding
the
impatiently
waiting
for
the
last
passenger
to
pass
through
john
bogdán
saw
her
and
his
heart
began
to
beat
so
violently
that
he
involuntarily
lingered
at
each
step
would
she
recognize
him
or
would
she
not
his
knee
joints
gave
way
as
if
they
had
suddenly
decayed
and
his
hand
trembled
as
he
held
out
the
ticket
she
took
the
ticket
and
let
him
pass
through
without
a
word
poor
john
bogdán
breath
stopped
short
but
he
pulled
himself
together
with
all
his
might
looked
her
firmly
in
the
face
with
his
one
eye
and
said
with
a
painful
effort
to
steady
his
voice
how
do
you
do
how
do
you
do
the
woman
rejoined
he
encountered
her
eyes
saw
them
widen
into
a
stare
saw
them
grope
over
his
mangled
face
and
then
quickly
turn
in
another
direction
as
if
she
could
not
bear
the
sight
he
wanted
to
stop
but
he
noticed
her
lips
quiver
and
heard
a
murmured
jesus
son
of
mary
as
if
he
were
the
devil
incarnate
and
he
tottered
on
deeply
wounded
she
did
not
recognize
me
the
blood
hammered
in
his
ears
she
did
not
recognize
me
did
not
recognize
me
he
dragged
himself
to
the
bench
opposite
the
station
threw
his
luggage
to
the
ground
and
sank
down
on
the
seat
she
did
not
recognize
him
the
wife
of
kovacs
the
did
not
recognize
john
bogdán
the
house
of
her
parents
stood
next
to
the
house
of
his
parents
she
and
he
had
gone
to
school
together
they
had
been
confirmed
together
he
had
held
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
and
kissed
her
heaven
knows
how
many
times
before
kovacs
came
to
the
village
to
woo
her
and
had
not
recognized
him
not
even
by
his
voice
so
great
was
the
change
he
glanced
over
at
her
again
involuntarily
and
saw
her
talking
eagerly
with
the
from
her
gestures
he
guessed
she
was
telling
of
the
horrible
sight
she
had
just
seen
the
stranger
soldier
so
hideously
disfigured
he
uttered
a
short
croaking
sound
an
abortive
curse
and
then
his
head
fell
on
his
chest
and
he
sobbed
like
a
deserted
woman
what
was
he
to
do
go
up
to
the
castle
open
the
door
to
the
quarters
and
call
out
a
saucy
hello
marcsa
to
the
astonished
girl
that
was
the
way
he
had
always
thought
of
it
the
devil
knows
how
often
he
had
painted
the
picture
to
the
dot
the
maids
screaming
cry
of
delight
her
flinging
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
the
thousand
questions
that
would
come
pouring
down
on
him
while
he
would
sit
there
with
marcsa
on
his
knees
and
now
and
then
throw
out
a
casual
reply
to
his
awed
attentive
listeners
but
now
how
about
it
now
go
to
marcsa
he
with
that
face
the
face
that
had
made
julia
the
wife
cross
herself
in
fright
was
marcsa
famed
throughout
the
county
for
her
sharp
tongue
and
haughty
ways
she
had
snubbed
the
men
by
the
score
laughed
at
them
made
fools
of
them
all
until
she
finally
fell
in
love
with
him
john
bogdán
thrust
his
fist
into
his
mouth
and
dug
his
teeth
into
the
flesh
until
the
pain
of
it
at
length
helped
him
subdue
his
sobbing
then
he
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
and
tried
to
think
never
in
his
life
had
anything
gone
amiss
with
him
he
had
always
been
liked
at
school
in
the
castle
and
even
in
the
barracks
he
had
gone
through
life
whistling
contentedly
a
alert
lad
an
excellent
jockey
and
a
coachman
who
drove
with
style
and
loved
his
horses
as
his
horses
loved
him
when
he
deigned
to
toss
a
kiss
to
the
women
as
he
dashed
by
he
was
accustomed
to
see
a
flattered
smile
come
to
their
faces
only
with
marcsa
did
it
take
a
little
longer
but
she
was
famous
for
her
beauty
far
and
wide
even
john
master
the
lord
of
the
castle
had
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
almost
enviously
when
marcsa
and
he
had
become
engaged
a
handsome
couple
the
pastor
had
said
john
bogdán
groped
again
for
the
little
mirror
in
his
pocket
and
then
sat
with
drooping
body
oppressed
by
a
profound
melancholy
that
thing
in
the
glass
was
to
be
the
bridegroom
of
the
beautiful
marcsa
what
did
that
ape
face
that
piece
of
patchwork
that
checkerboard
which
the
damned
quack
the
impostor
whom
they
called
a
distinguished
medical
authority
a
celebrated
doctor
had
basted
together
what
did
it
have
to
do
with
john
bogdán
whom
marcsa
had
promised
to
marry
and
whom
she
had
accompanied
to
the
station
crying
when
he
had
gone
off
to
the
war
for
marcsa
there
was
only
john
bogdán
the
one
that
was
coachman
to
the
lord
of
the
castle
and
the
handsomest
man
in
the
village
was
he
still
coachman
the
lord
would
take
care
not
to
disgrace
his
magnificent
pair
with
such
a
scarecrow
or
drive
to
the
county
seat
with
such
a
monstrosity
on
the
box
haying
that
what
they
would
put
him
to
cleaning
out
the
dung
from
the
stables
and
marcsa
the
beautiful
marcsa
whom
all
the
men
were
vying
for
would
she
be
the
wife
of
a
miserable
day
laborer
no
of
this
john
bogdán
was
certain
the
man
sitting
on
the
bench
there
was
no
longer
john
bogdán
to
marcsa
she
would
not
have
him
now
no
more
than
the
lord
would
have
him
on
the
coachman
box
a
cripple
is
a
cripple
and
marcsa
had
engaged
herself
to
john
bogdán
not
to
the
fright
that
he
was
bringing
back
home
to
her
his
melancholy
gradually
gave
way
to
an
ungovernable
fury
against
those
people
in
the
city
who
had
given
him
all
that
buncombe
and
talked
him
into
heaven
knows
what
marcsa
should
be
proud
because
he
had
been
disfigured
in
the
service
of
his
fatherland
proud
he
laughed
scornfully
and
his
fingers
tightened
convulsively
about
the
cursed
mirror
until
the
glass
broke
into
bits
and
cut
his
hand
the
blood
trickled
slowly
down
his
sleeves
without
his
noticing
it
so
great
was
his
rage
against
that
bunch
of
aristocratic
ladies
in
the
hospital
whose
twaddle
had
deprived
him
of
his
reason
they
probably
thought
that
a
man
with
one
eye
and
half
a
nose
was
good
enough
for
a
peasant
girl
fatherland
would
marcsa
go
to
the
altar
with
the
fatherland
could
she
show
off
the
fatherland
to
the
women
when
she
would
see
them
looking
at
her
pityingly
did
the
fatherland
drive
through
the
village
with
ribbons
flying
from
its
hat
ridiculous
sitting
on
the
bench
opposite
the
station
with
the
sign
of
the
village
in
view
a
short
name
a
single
word
which
comprised
his
whole
life
all
his
memories
hopes
and
experiences
john
bogdán
suddenly
thought
of
one
of
the
village
characters
peter
the
cripple
who
had
lived
in
the
tumbledown
hut
behind
the
mill
many
years
before
when
john
was
still
a
child
john
saw
him
quite
distinctly
standing
there
with
his
noisy
wooden
leg
and
his
sad
starved
emaciated
face
he
too
had
sacrificed
a
part
of
himself
his
leg
for
the
fatherland
in
bosnia
during
the
occupation
and
then
he
had
had
to
live
in
the
old
hovel
all
alone
made
fun
of
by
the
children
who
imitated
his
walk
and
grumblingly
tolerated
by
the
peasants
who
resented
the
imposition
of
this
burden
upon
the
community
in
the
service
of
the
fatherland
never
had
the
fatherland
been
mentioned
when
peter
the
cripple
went
by
they
called
him
contemptuously
the
village
pauper
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
john
bogdán
gnashed
his
teeth
in
a
rage
that
he
had
not
thought
of
peter
the
cripple
in
the
hospital
then
he
would
have
given
those
city
people
a
piece
of
his
mind
he
would
have
told
them
what
he
thought
of
their
silly
prattling
humbug
about
the
fatherland
and
about
the
great
honor
it
was
to
return
home
to
marcsa
looking
like
a
monkey
if
he
had
the
doctor
in
his
clutches
now
the
fakir
had
photographed
him
not
once
but
a
dozen
times
from
all
sides
after
each
butchery
as
though
he
had
accomplished
a
miracle
had
turned
out
a
wonderful
masterpiece
and
here
julia
even
julia
his
playmate
his
neighbor
had
not
recognized
him
so
deep
was
john
bogdán
sunk
in
his
misery
so
engulfed
in
grim
plans
of
vengeance
that
he
did
not
notice
a
man
who
had
been
standing
in
front
of
him
for
several
minutes
eyeing
him
curiously
from
every
angle
suddenly
a
voice
woke
him
up
out
of
his
brooding
and
a
hot
wave
surged
into
his
face
and
his
heart
stood
still
with
delighted
terror
as
he
heard
some
one
say
is
that
you
bogdán
he
raised
himself
happy
at
having
been
recognized
after
all
but
the
next
moment
he
knitted
his
brows
in
complete
disappointment
it
was
mihály
the
humpback
there
was
no
other
man
in
the
whole
village
even
in
the
whole
county
whose
hand
john
bogdán
would
not
at
that
moment
have
grasped
cordially
in
a
surge
of
gratitude
but
this
humpback
he
never
had
wanted
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him
and
now
certainly
not
the
fellow
might
imagine
he
had
found
a
comrade
and
was
probably
glad
that
he
was
no
longer
the
only
disfigured
person
in
the
place
yes
it
i
well
the
humpback
small
piercing
eyes
searched
bogdán
scarred
face
curiously
and
he
shook
his
head
in
pity
well
well
the
russians
certainly
have
done
you
up
bogdán
snarled
at
him
like
a
vicious
cur
it
none
of
your
business
what
right
have
you
to
talk
if
i
had
come
into
the
world
like
you
with
my
belly
on
my
back
the
russians
have
done
anything
to
me
the
humpback
seated
himself
quietly
beside
john
without
showing
the
least
sign
of
being
insulted
the
war
has
made
you
any
politer
i
can
see
that
he
remarked
drily
you
not
exactly
in
a
happy
frame
of
mind
which
does
not
surprise
me
yes
that
the
way
it
is
the
poor
people
must
give
up
their
sound
flesh
and
bone
so
that
the
enemy
should
not
deprive
the
rich
of
their
superfluity
you
may
bless
your
stars
you
came
out
of
it
as
well
as
you
did
i
do
bogdán
growled
with
a
glance
of
hatred
the
shells
do
ask
if
you
are
rich
or
poor
counts
and
barons
are
lying
out
there
rotting
in
the
sun
like
dead
beasts
any
man
that
god
has
not
smitten
in
his
cradle
so
that
he
not
fit
to
be
either
a
man
or
a
woman
is
out
in
the
battlefield
now
whether
he
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
or
used
to
eating
from
golden
plates
the
humpback
cleared
his
throat
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
there
are
all
sorts
of
people
he
observed
and
was
about
to
add
something
else
but
bethought
himself
and
remained
silent
this
bogdán
always
had
had
the
soul
of
a
flunkey
proud
of
being
allowed
to
serve
the
high
and
mighty
and
feeling
solid
with
his
oppressors
because
he
was
allowed
to
contribute
to
their
pomp
in
livery
and
silver
buttons
his
masters
had
sicked
him
on
to
face
the
cannons
in
defense
of
their
own
wealth
and
now
the
man
sat
there
disfigured
with
only
one
eye
and
still
would
not
permit
any
criticism
of
his
gracious
employers
against
such
stupidity
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
there
was
no
use
wasting
a
single
word
on
him
the
two
remained
sitting
for
a
while
in
silence
bogdán
filled
his
pipe
carefully
and
deliberately
and
mihály
watched
him
with
interest
are
you
going
to
the
castle
the
humpback
asked
cautiously
when
the
pipe
was
at
last
lit
john
bogdán
was
well
aware
just
what
the
hateful
creature
was
aiming
at
he
knew
him
a
socialist
that
what
he
was
one
of
those
who
take
the
bread
out
of
poor
people
mouths
by
dinning
a
lot
of
nonsense
into
their
ears
just
like
a
mean
dog
who
snaps
at
the
hand
that
feeds
him
he
had
made
a
good
living
as
foreman
in
the
brickyard
and
as
thanks
he
had
incited
all
the
workmen
against
the
owner
bogdán
master
until
they
demanded
twice
as
much
wages
and
were
ready
to
set
fire
to
the
castle
on
all
four
corners
once
mihály
had
tried
his
luck
with
him
too
he
had
wanted
to
make
his
master
out
a
bad
man
but
this
time
he
had
bucked
up
against
the
right
person
a
box
on
his
right
ear
and
a
box
on
his
left
ear
and
then
a
good
sound
kick
that
was
the
answer
to
keep
him
from
ever
again
trying
to
make
a
socialist
of
john
bogdán
one
of
those
low
fellows
who
know
no
god
or
fatherland
mihály
moved
on
the
bench
uneasily
every
now
and
then
scrutinizing
his
neighbor
from
the
side
at
last
he
plucked
up
courage
and
said
suddenly
they
probably
be
glad
up
there
that
you
are
back
your
arms
are
still
whole
and
they
need
people
in
the
factory
bogdán
turned
up
his
nose
in
the
brickyard
he
asked
disdainfully
the
humpback
burst
out
laughing
brickyard
brickyard
is
good
who
needs
bricks
in
war
the
gone
long
ago
man
do
you
see
those
trucks
over
there
they
are
all
loaded
up
with
shells
every
saturday
a
whole
train
of
shells
leaves
here
bogdán
listened
eagerly
that
was
news
a
change
on
the
estate
of
which
he
had
not
yet
heard
you
see
there
is
such
a
nice
division
mihály
continued
smiling
sarcastically
one
goes
away
and
lets
his
head
be
blown
off
the
other
remains
comfortably
at
home
and
manufactures
shells
and
decorates
his
castle
with
bills
well
i
satisfied
what
are
we
to
do
eh
shoot
with
peas
or
with
air
you
ca
carry
on
a
war
without
shells
shells
are
needed
just
as
much
as
soldiers
exactly
and
because
the
rich
have
the
choice
of
being
soldiers
or
making
shells
they
choose
to
make
the
shells
and
send
off
to
have
your
head
blown
off
what
are
you
getting
for
your
eye
dollars
a
year
or
perhaps
as
much
as
fifty
and
the
others
whom
the
ravens
are
feeding
on
do
get
even
that
out
of
the
war
but
the
gentleman
up
in
the
castle
is
making
his
five
hundred
a
day
and
risk
even
his
little
finger
doing
it
i
be
a
patriot
on
those
terms
myself
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
at
first
of
course
they
said
he
was
going
to
war
and
he
did
actually
ride
off
in
great
state
but
three
weeks
later
he
was
back
here
again
with
machines
and
all
the
equipment
and
now
he
delivers
fine
orations
in
the
townhouse
and
sends
other
men
off
to
die
and
on
top
of
it
is
gallant
to
the
wives
left
behind
he
stuffs
his
pockets
and
fools
with
every
girl
in
the
factory
he
the
cock
of
the
whole
district
bogdán
his
brows
knit
in
annoyance
let
the
man
talk
on
but
the
last
part
struck
him
with
a
shock
he
pricked
up
his
ears
and
grew
uneasy
and
for
a
while
struggled
heroically
against
asking
a
question
that
burned
on
his
lips
but
in
the
end
he
could
not
restrain
himself
and
blurted
out
is
is
marcsa
working
in
the
factory
too
the
humpback
eyes
flashed
marcsa
the
beautiful
marcsa
i
should
say
so
she
been
made
a
forelady
though
they
say
she
never
had
a
shell
in
her
hands
but
to
make
up
the
lord
hands
have
with
a
short
hoarse
growl
john
bogdán
flew
at
the
humpback
throat
squeezed
in
his
adam
apple
pressing
it
into
his
neck
and
held
him
in
a
merciless
clutch
the
man
beat
about
with
his
arms
his
eyes
popped
from
his
head
in
fright
his
throat
gurgled
and
his
face
turned
livid
then
john
bogdán
released
his
hold
and
mihály
fell
to
the
ground
and
lay
there
gasping
bogdán
quickly
gathered
up
his
things
and
strode
off
taking
long
quick
steps
as
if
afraid
of
arriving
too
late
for
something
in
the
castle
he
gave
not
another
look
back
at
mihály
the
humpback
never
turned
around
once
but
quietly
went
his
way
and
for
a
long
while
felt
the
warm
throat
in
his
hand
what
was
a
man
who
lay
gasping
on
the
road
to
him
one
man
more
or
less
in
the
rhythmic
regularity
of
the
marching
column
he
had
passed
by
thousands
like
him
and
it
had
never
occurred
to
his
mind
dulled
by
weariness
that
the
grey
spots
thickly
strewn
over
the
fields
the
heaps
lining
the
roadway
like
piles
of
dung
in
the
spring
were
human
beings
struck
down
by
death
he
and
his
comrades
had
waded
in
the
dead
there
at
kielce
when
they
made
a
dash
across
the
fields
and
earthy
grey
hands
rose
out
of
every
furrow
pawing
the
air
and
trousers
drenched
in
blood
and
distorted
faces
grew
out
of
the
ground
as
if
all
the
dead
were
scrambling
from
their
graves
for
the
last
judgment
they
had
stepped
and
stumbled
over
corpses
once
the
fat
little
officer
of
reserves
to
the
great
amusement
of
his
company
had
gotten
deathly
sick
at
his
stomach
because
he
had
inadvertently
stepped
on
the
chest
of
a
russian
and
the
body
had
given
way
under
him
and
he
had
scarcely
been
able
to
withdraw
his
foot
from
the
foul
hole
john
bogdán
smiled
as
he
recalled
the
wicked
jokes
the
men
had
cracked
at
the
officer
expense
how
the
officer
had
gone
all
white
and
leaned
against
a
tree
and
carried
on
like
a
man
who
has
much
more
than
quenched
his
thirst
the
road
glowed
in
the
sun
the
village
clock
struck
twelve
from
the
hill
yonder
came
like
an
answer
the
deep
bellow
of
the
factory
whistle
and
a
little
white
cloud
rose
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
bogdán
quickened
his
pace
running
rather
than
walking
heedless
of
the
drops
of
sweat
that
ran
down
and
tickled
his
neck
for
almost
a
year
he
had
breathed
nothing
but
the
hospital
atmosphere
had
smelled
nothing
but
iodoform
and
lysol
and
seen
nothing
but
roofs
and
walls
his
lungs
drew
in
the
aroma
of
the
blossoming
meadows
with
deep
satisfaction
and
the
soles
of
his
boots
tramped
the
ground
sturdily
as
if
he
were
again
marching
in
regular
order
this
was
the
first
walk
he
had
taken
since
he
was
wounded
the
first
road
he
had
seen
since
those
wild
marches
on
russian
soil
at
moments
he
seemed
to
hear
the
cannons
roaring
the
short
struggle
with
the
humpback
had
set
his
blood
coursing
and
his
memories
of
the
war
for
a
time
stifled
as
it
were
beneath
a
layer
of
dust
by
the
dreary
monotony
of
the
hospital
life
suddenly
came
whirling
back
to
him
he
almost
regretted
having
let
that
damned
blackguard
go
so
soon
one
moment
more
and
he
would
never
have
opened
his
blasphemous
mouth
again
his
head
would
have
fallen
back
exhausted
to
one
side
he
would
once
again
have
embraced
the
air
longingly
with
outspread
fingers
and
then
in
a
flash
would
have
shrunk
together
exactly
like
the
fat
messy
russian
with
the
large
blue
eyes
who
was
the
first
man
to
present
himself
to
peter
with
a
greeting
from
john
bogdán
bogdán
had
not
let
loose
until
he
had
altogether
quit
squirming
he
had
choked
him
dead
as
a
doornail
and
still
he
was
a
comical
fellow
not
nearly
so
disgusting
as
that
rascally
humpback
but
he
was
the
first
enemy
soldier
whom
he
had
got
into
his
grasp
his
very
first
russian
a
magnificent
array
of
others
had
followed
though
the
fat
man
was
the
only
one
bogdán
had
choked
to
death
he
had
smashed
scores
with
the
of
his
gun
and
run
his
bayonet
through
scores
of
others
he
had
even
squashed
with
his
boots
the
wretch
who
had
struck
down
his
dearest
comrade
before
his
very
eyes
but
never
again
did
he
choke
a
man
to
death
that
was
why
the
little
fat
fellow
stuck
in
his
memory
he
had
no
recollection
of
the
others
whatever
all
he
saw
now
in
his
mind
was
a
tangle
of
uniforms
and
as
he
thought
of
his
heroic
deeds
the
gnashing
the
stamping
the
gasping
and
the
cursing
of
the
encounters
resounded
in
his
ears
how
many
he
wondered
had
he
sent
to
the
other
world
god
alone
may
have
counted
them
he
himself
had
had
enough
to
do
trying
to
save
his
own
skin
had
a
man
stopped
to
look
around
he
would
have
carried
his
curiosity
to
the
next
world
and
yet
there
was
another
face
that
remained
fixed
in
his
memory
a
great
big
thin
fellow
as
tall
as
a
beanpole
with
enormous
yellow
tusks
which
he
gnashed
like
a
boar
yes
he
had
as
clear
a
picture
of
him
as
if
it
had
been
yesterday
he
saw
him
up
against
the
wall
already
swinging
his
gun
over
his
head
one
second
more
and
the
would
have
come
whizzing
down
but
a
sleepy
russian
was
never
the
man
to
get
the
better
of
john
bogdán
before
he
had
the
chance
to
bring
down
his
gun
bogdán
bayonet
was
in
between
his
ribs
and
the
russian
fell
over
on
his
own
gun
the
bayonet
pierced
him
through
and
through
and
even
went
into
the
wall
behind
him
and
came
mighty
near
breaking
off
but
the
same
thing
never
happened
to
bogdán
again
it
had
happened
that
once
because
he
had
thrust
too
hard
with
clenched
teeth
gripping
the
rod
in
a
tight
clutch
as
if
it
were
iron
that
he
had
to
cleave
the
fact
was
he
had
not
yet
discovered
that
it
really
is
so
difficult
to
mow
down
a
human
being
he
had
been
prepared
for
any
amount
of
resistance
and
his
bayonet
had
glided
into
the
fellow
body
like
butter
his
mouth
had
remained
wide
open
in
astonishment
he
recalled
it
to
the
dot
a
man
who
has
never
tried
a
bayonet
thrust
thinks
a
human
being
is
made
up
all
of
bones
and
he
fetches
out
for
a
good
hard
stroke
then
he
in
a
pickle
to
free
his
weapon
again
before
one
of
the
devils
takes
advantage
of
his
defenselessness
the
way
to
do
was
to
go
at
it
very
lightly
with
a
short
jerky
thrust
then
the
blade
ran
in
of
itself
like
a
good
horse
you
actually
had
trouble
holding
it
back
the
most
important
thing
was
not
to
take
your
eye
off
your
enemy
you
must
look
at
your
bayonet
or
the
spot
you
intend
to
pierce
you
must
always
watch
your
enemy
so
as
to
guess
his
move
in
time
it
from
your
enemy
face
that
you
must
read
the
right
moment
for
stepping
backward
they
all
behaved
the
same
way
exactly
like
the
first
tall
wild
fellow
who
gnashed
his
tusks
all
of
a
sudden
their
faces
turned
absolutely
smooth
as
if
the
cold
iron
in
their
body
had
chilled
their
fury
their
eyes
opened
wide
in
astonishment
and
looked
at
their
enemy
as
if
to
ask
in
reproach
what
are
you
doing
then
they
usually
clutched
at
the
bayonet
and
needlessly
cut
their
fingers
too
before
they
fell
over
dead
if
you
did
know
exactly
what
to
do
and
did
hold
your
weapon
back
in
time
and
withdraw
it
quickly
from
the
wound
just
when
you
saw
the
man
eyes
growing
large
you
would
be
carried
along
down
with
him
or
would
get
hit
on
the
head
by
the
of
another
enemy
gun
long
before
you
could
draw
your
bayonet
out
these
were
all
things
that
john
bogdán
had
often
discussed
with
his
comrades
after
severe
frays
when
they
criticized
the
men
who
had
fallen
for
behaving
stupidly
and
who
had
had
to
pay
with
their
lives
for
their
awkwardness
as
he
strode
along
in
haste
up
the
familiar
road
to
the
castle
he
was
fairly
lost
in
recollections
his
legs
moved
of
themselves
like
horses
on
the
homeward
way
he
passed
through
the
open
grille
gateway
and
was
already
walking
on
the
gravel
path
his
head
bowed
on
his
chest
without
noticing
that
he
had
reached
home
the
neighing
of
horses
woke
him
up
from
his
thoughts
with
a
start
he
stood
still
deeply
stirred
by
the
sight
of
the
stables
only
a
few
feet
away
and
inside
in
the
twilight
the
gleam
of
his
favorite
flanks
he
was
about
to
turn
off
the
path
and
make
for
the
stable
door
when
far
away
down
below
at
the
other
end
of
the
large
place
he
saw
a
woman
coming
from
the
brickyard
she
wore
a
dotted
red
silk
kerchief
on
her
head
and
carried
her
full
figure
proudly
and
the
challenging
sway
of
her
hips
billowed
her
wide
skirts
as
the
wind
billows
a
field
of
ripe
grain
john
bogdán
stood
stockstill
as
if
some
one
had
struck
him
on
the
chest
it
was
marcsa
there
was
not
another
girl
in
the
whole
country
who
walked
like
that
he
threw
his
luggage
to
the
ground
and
dashed
off
marcsa
marcsa
his
cry
thundered
out
over
the
broad
courtyard
the
girl
turned
and
waited
for
his
approach
peering
curiously
through
eyes
when
almost
face
to
face
with
her
bogdán
stood
still
marcsa
he
repeated
in
a
whisper
his
gaze
fastened
upon
her
face
anxiously
he
saw
her
turn
pale
white
as
chalk
saw
her
eyes
leap
to
and
fro
uneasily
from
his
left
cheek
to
his
right
cheek
and
back
again
then
horror
came
into
her
eyes
she
clapped
her
hands
to
her
face
and
turned
and
ran
away
as
fast
as
her
legs
would
carry
her
in
utter
sadness
bogdán
stared
after
her
that
was
exactly
the
way
he
had
imagined
their
meeting
again
since
julia
the
wife
the
woman
he
had
grown
up
with
had
not
recognized
him
but
to
run
away
that
rankled
no
need
for
her
to
run
away
john
bogdán
was
not
the
man
to
force
himself
on
a
woman
if
he
no
longer
pleased
her
now
that
he
was
disfigured
well
then
she
could
look
for
another
man
and
he
too
he
would
find
another
woman
he
was
bothered
about
that
this
was
what
he
had
wanted
to
tell
marcsa
he
bounded
after
her
and
overtook
her
a
few
feet
from
the
machine
shop
why
do
you
run
away
from
me
he
growled
breathless
and
caught
her
hand
if
you
do
want
me
any
more
you
need
only
say
so
what
do
you
think
i
going
to
eat
you
up
she
stared
at
him
searchingly
in
uncertainty
he
almost
felt
sorry
for
her
she
was
trembling
so
how
you
look
he
heard
her
stammer
and
he
turned
red
with
anger
you
knew
it
i
had
them
write
to
you
that
a
shell
hit
me
did
you
think
it
made
me
just
speak
straight
out
if
you
do
want
me
any
more
straight
wine
is
what
i
want
no
mixture
yes
or
no
i
force
you
to
marry
me
just
say
it
right
away
yes
or
no
marcsa
was
silent
there
was
something
in
his
face
in
his
one
eye
that
took
her
breath
away
that
dug
into
her
vitals
like
cold
fingers
she
cast
her
eyes
down
and
stammered
but
you
have
no
position
yet
how
can
we
marry
you
must
first
ask
the
master
if
he
it
was
as
if
a
red
pall
woven
of
flames
dropped
in
front
of
john
bogdán
eyes
the
master
what
was
she
saying
about
the
master
he
thought
of
the
humpback
and
it
came
to
him
in
a
flash
that
the
fellow
had
not
lied
his
fingers
clutched
her
wrist
like
a
pair
of
glowing
tongs
so
that
she
cried
out
with
the
pain
the
master
bogdán
bellowed
what
has
the
master
got
to
do
between
you
and
me
yes
or
no
i
want
an
answer
the
master
has
nothing
to
do
with
us
marcsa
drew
herself
up
all
of
a
sudden
a
remarkable
assurance
came
to
her
the
color
returned
to
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
flashed
proudly
she
stood
there
with
the
haughty
bearing
so
familiar
to
bogdán
her
head
held
high
in
defiance
bogdán
observed
the
change
and
saw
that
her
gaze
traveled
over
his
shoulder
he
let
go
her
hand
and
turned
instantly
just
what
he
thought
the
master
coming
out
of
the
machine
shop
his
old
forester
tóth
followed
him
marcsa
bounded
past
bogdán
like
a
cat
and
ran
up
to
the
lord
and
bent
over
and
kissed
his
hand
bogdán
saw
the
three
of
them
draw
near
and
lowered
his
head
like
a
ram
for
attack
a
cold
determined
quiet
rose
in
him
slowly
as
in
the
trenches
when
the
trumpeter
gave
the
signal
for
a
charge
he
felt
the
lord
hand
touch
his
shoulder
and
he
took
a
step
backward
what
was
the
meaning
of
it
all
the
lord
was
speaking
of
heroism
and
fatherland
a
lot
of
rubbish
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
marcsa
he
let
him
go
on
talking
let
the
words
pour
down
on
him
like
rain
without
paying
any
attention
to
their
meaning
his
glance
wandered
to
and
fro
uneasily
from
the
lord
to
marcsa
and
then
to
the
forester
until
it
rested
curiously
on
something
shining
it
was
the
nickeled
hilt
of
the
hanging
at
the
old
forester
side
and
sparkling
in
the
sunlight
like
a
bayonet
thought
bogdán
and
an
idea
flashed
through
his
mind
to
whip
the
thing
out
of
the
scabbard
and
run
it
up
to
the
hilt
in
the
hussy
body
but
her
rounded
hips
her
bright
billowing
skirts
confused
him
in
war
he
had
never
had
to
do
with
women
he
could
not
exactly
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
to
make
a
thrust
into
that
beskirted
body
there
his
glance
traveled
back
to
the
master
and
now
he
noticed
that
his
stiffnecked
silence
had
pulled
him
up
short
he
is
gnashing
his
teeth
it
struck
him
just
like
the
tall
russian
and
he
almost
smiled
at
a
vision
that
came
to
his
mind
of
the
lord
also
getting
a
smooth
face
and
astonished
reproachful
eyes
but
had
he
said
something
about
marcsa
just
then
what
was
marcsa
to
him
bogdán
drew
himself
up
defiantly
i
will
arrange
matters
with
marcsa
myself
sir
it
between
her
and
me
he
rejoined
hoarsely
and
looked
his
master
straight
in
the
face
still
had
his
mustache
quite
even
on
the
two
sides
and
curling
delicately
upwards
at
the
ends
what
was
it
the
humpback
had
said
one
man
goes
away
and
lets
his
head
be
blown
off
he
was
so
stupid
after
all
the
humpback
was
what
bogdán
said
infuriated
the
master
bogdán
let
him
shout
and
stared
like
a
man
hypnotized
at
the
nickeled
hilt
of
the
it
was
not
until
the
name
marcsa
again
struck
his
ear
that
he
became
attentive
marcsa
is
in
my
employ
now
he
heard
the
lord
saying
you
know
i
am
fond
of
you
bogdán
i
let
you
take
care
of
the
horses
again
if
you
care
to
but
marcsa
is
to
be
let
alone
i
wo
have
any
rumpus
if
she
still
wants
to
marry
you
all
well
and
good
but
if
she
does
to
be
let
alone
if
i
hear
once
again
that
you
have
annoyed
her
chase
you
to
the
devil
do
you
understand
foaming
with
rage
bogdán
let
out
the
stream
of
his
wrath
to
the
devil
he
shouted
you
chase
me
to
the
devil
you
had
first
better
go
there
yourself
i
been
to
the
devil
already
for
eight
months
i
was
in
hell
here
my
face
you
can
tell
from
my
face
that
i
come
from
hell
to
play
the
protector
here
and
stuff
your
pockets
full
and
send
the
others
out
to
die
that
easy
a
man
who
dawdles
at
home
has
no
right
to
send
men
to
the
devil
who
have
already
been
in
hell
for
his
sake
so
overwhelming
was
his
indignation
that
he
spoke
like
the
humpback
socialist
and
was
not
ashamed
of
it
he
stood
there
ready
to
leap
with
tensely
drawn
muscles
like
a
wild
animal
he
saw
the
lord
make
ready
to
strike
him
saw
his
distorted
face
saw
the
flash
through
the
air
and
even
saw
it
descending
upon
him
but
he
did
not
feel
the
short
hard
blow
on
his
back
with
one
bound
he
ripped
the
out
of
the
scabbard
and
thrust
it
between
the
lord
ribs
not
with
a
long
sweep
so
that
some
one
could
have
stayed
his
arm
before
he
struck
oh
no
but
quite
lightly
from
below
with
a
short
jerk
exactly
as
he
had
learned
by
experience
in
battle
the
was
as
good
as
his
bayonet
it
ran
into
the
flesh
like
butter
then
everything
came
about
just
as
it
always
did
john
bogdán
stood
with
his
chin
forward
and
saw
the
lord
face
distorted
by
anger
suddenly
smooth
out
and
turn
as
placid
and
even
as
if
it
had
been
ironed
he
saw
his
eyes
widen
and
look
over
at
him
in
astonishment
with
the
reproachful
question
what
are
you
doing
the
one
thing
bogdán
did
not
see
was
the
collapsing
of
the
lord
body
for
at
that
instant
a
blow
crashed
down
on
the
back
of
his
head
like
the
downpour
of
a
waterfall
dropping
from
an
infinite
height
for
one
second
he
still
saw
marcsa
face
framed
in
a
fiery
wheel
then
his
skull
split
open
he
fell
over
on
top
of
his
master
whose
body
already
lay
quivering
on
the
ground
