colonies
australian
i
it
was
one
sunday
afternoon
in
the
middle
of
december
and
in
the
province
of
south
australia
the
grass
was
withered
almost
to
the
roots
fast
turning
gray
and
brown
indeed
along
the
barer
ridges
of
the
beautiful
hills
that
rise
in
serried
ranks
to
the
east
of
adelaide
the
herbage
was
already
as
dry
and
bleached
as
carded
flax
in
the
gullies
thickly
timbered
and
lying
in
perpetual
shade
the
ground
still
retained
the
faint
graying
green
distinctive
of
australian
herbage
in
a
state
of
transition
from
spring
verdure
to
summer
drought
but
soon
even
the
shadiest
recesses
would
bear
witness
to
the
scorching
dryness
of
the
season
for
even
before
the
middle
of
this
first
month
of
summer
two
or
three
of
those
phenomenal
days
had
come
which
furnish
anecdotes
for
many
successive
months
alike
to
the
weather
statist
and
the
numerous
class
who
cultivate
community
of
soul
by
comparing
experiences
of
those
dreadful
days
on
which
the
hall
thermometer
stood
at
before
this
sunday
had
not
quite
been
one
of
the
days
that
make
the
oldest
residents
turn
over
heat
averages
extending
to
the
early
dawn
of
the
country
s
history
but
nevertheless
it
was
a
very
hot
still
day
without
a
breath
of
wind
stirring
and
in
the
distance
that
faint
shimmering
bluish
haze
which
to
the
experienced
eye
tells
its
own
tale
of
days
to
come
the
masses
of
white
silver
and
messmate
that
clothe
these
same
adelaide
hills
so
thickly
formed
a
grateful
for
the
eye
wearied
with
the
steadfast
glare
of
sunshine
so
did
the
vineyards
that
dot
their
declining
slopes
and
the
gardens
and
orchards
that
are
scattered
broadcast
to
the
east
of
the
town
but
even
adelaide
itself
is
interwoven
with
the
foliage
of
trees
which
do
so
much
to
mitigate
both
for
eye
and
body
the
severities
of
a
climate
this
fascinating
embroidery
of
trees
is
more
especially
observable
in
glancing
over
north
adelaide
this
extensive
and
important
suburb
which
is
divided
from
adelaide
proper
by
the
torrens
lake
and
park
lands
lies
considerably
above
the
city
and
adjacent
suburbs
so
large
a
proportion
of
the
houses
are
surrounded
by
gardens
that
from
some
points
of
view
north
adelaide
looks
like
a
wood
thickly
studded
with
houses
and
these
gardens
are
as
a
rule
neither
suburban
slips
with
precocious
trees
selected
for
their
speedy
power
of
growth
nor
the
painfully
pretentious
enclosures
which
auctioneers
delight
to
term
no
they
are
genuine
shadowy
well
planted
well
watered
rich
in
flowers
and
many
bending
in
due
season
under
their
fertile
loads
haunted
with
the
hum
of
rifling
bees
fragrant
with
the
perfume
of
blossoms
in
such
a
garden
on
this
sunday
afternoon
a
young
man
and
woman
were
slowly
pacing
up
and
down
a
broad
central
walk
thickly
trellised
with
vines
the
gadding
tendrils
the
wealth
of
wide
emerald
leaves
the
countless
oval
clusters
of
ripening
black
prince
and
delicate
ladies
clothed
the
trellis
on
the
sides
and
overhead
made
a
delightful
picture
so
did
the
great
hard
by
garlanded
after
their
kind
with
pale
pink
yellow
white
and
roses
parallel
with
this
vine
arcade
there
were
loquat
trees
loaded
with
thick
clusters
of
creamy
fruit
and
with
globes
nestling
among
glossy
boughs
sheeted
in
waxen
blossoms
whose
penetrating
odour
loaded
the
atmosphere
but
as
so
often
happens
when
a
young
man
and
woman
are
engaged
in
a
neither
the
objects
round
them
nor
any
topic
of
wide
social
importance
engrossed
their
attention
do
you
know
why
i
asked
you
to
come
out
into
the
garden
stella
said
the
young
man
breaking
a
pause
that
had
followed
some
previous
talk
oh
to
admire
the
roses
and
flick
the
poor
with
your
now
and
i
wouldn
t
mind
betting
a
thousand
to
one
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
but
that
s
the
way
with
you
you
ll
never
help
a
fellow
out
of
a
hole
why
didn
t
you
come
to
melbourne
last
month
ted
that
reminds
me
shouldn
t
i
congratulate
you
on
your
horse
winning
the
melbourne
cup
or
is
it
an
old
stupid
story
by
this
time
it
s
the
things
that
don
t
come
off
which
make
the
stupid
well
i
congratulate
you
then
how
long
have
you
been
on
the
turf
i
haven
t
been
on
the
turf
at
all
in
one
way
i
ve
bred
racehorses
and
bought
and
sold
them
ever
since
my
uncle
died
leaving
me
strathhaye
that
s
now
six
years
ago
come
well
for
six
years
you
have
been
more
deeply
interested
in
young
horses
than
in
anything
else
in
the
you
know
a
jolly
sight
better
than
you
have
talked
of
them
dreamt
of
them
been
with
them
several
times
you
have
nearly
died
for
them
always
you
have
lived
for
them
and
now
at
last
you
have
won
the
blue
ribbon
of
the
australian
racing
world
how
did
you
feel
when
you
saw
your
horse
pass
the
i
didn
t
see
him
at
all
he
was
a
dark
horse
and
sold
the
bookmakers
right
and
left
there
was
a
packed
mob
of
them
yelling
like
devils
calling
out
this
horse
and
the
other
when
the
number
was
put
up
and
people
kept
shouting
konrad
i
saw
blue
stars
for
a
it
must
be
delightful
for
something
to
happen
that
makes
you
see
blue
stars
i
almost
wish
i
had
been
i
wish
you
had
i
would
have
had
a
new
drag
in
your
honour
and
a
team
that
would
have
made
most
of
those
there
look
silly
why
didn
t
you
come
when
laurette
wrote
to
ask
you
oh
let
me
see
i
know
there
were
very
good
reasons
but
i
forget
now
stella
don
t
sham
you
wouldn
t
forget
them
if
they
were
very
good
what
nonsense
the
better
they
are
the
more
completely
they
go
under
sometimes
think
what
good
reasons
there
are
for
being
good
and
things
of
that
now
i
m
not
going
to
be
put
off
you
ve
often
served
me
that
trick
i
ask
you
a
question
and
you
start
a
new
quarry
and
the
night
after
i
wake
up
thinking
stella
never
told
me
whether
she
still
writes
to
billy
stein
or
whatever
it
may
be
why
didn
t
you
come
must
you
know
yes
well
as
i
was
walking
by
the
torrens
i
found
a
little
sewn
up
in
the
most
cunning
manner
with
a
red
worsted
thread
i
unpicked
it
and
out
flew
a
little
dove
crying
don
t
go
to
the
melbourne
cup
don
t
go
to
the
melbourne
cup
well
i
ll
be
hanged
if
ever
i
saw
a
girl
that
can
make
up
a
fib
patter
than
you
can
when
you
like
now
i
know
why
you
wanted
to
come
into
the
that
my
mother
shouldn
t
overhear
you
talking
like
a
oh
that
s
all
you
know
about
the
way
jockeys
talk
you
never
heard
them
besides
you
know
you
shouldn
t
tell
a
it
s
not
a
s
a
that
s
blasphemy
isn
t
it
calling
yarns
you
make
up
as
you
go
along
after
things
in
the
bible
do
you
think
there
are
no
parables
except
those
in
the
new
testament
i
know
a
parable
is
when
a
fellow
asks
for
a
long
drink
in
everlasting
fire
and
the
other
chap
in
isaac
s
bosom
won
t
even
wet
his
lips
by
jove
i
ve
often
thought
there
wasn
t
much
to
choose
between
them
for
goodness
one
had
his
good
time
here
and
turned
his
back
on
the
beggar
but
the
beggar
was
more
had
all
eternity
to
behave
better
but
didn
oh
ted
you
are
too
delightfully
i
wish
to
the
lord
you
really
believed
i
was
too
delightfully
anything
surely
you
might
have
dropped
a
fellow
a
line
when
konrad
won
seeing
you
had
the
naming
of
did
i
when
why
a
month
after
he
was
foaled
don
t
you
remember
that
frightfully
stupid
ball
at
government
house
where
a
fellow
couldn
t
put
a
hoof
down
without
treading
on
some
old
tabby
s
train
there
was
bartholomew
gay
with
one
from
here
to
the
polar
satin
embroidered
with
chinese
dragons
or
something
i
had
to
stand
with
one
foot
in
the
air
like
a
so
often
for
fear
of
stamping
on
her
tail
at
last
i
firmly
planted
my
foot
on
it
and
tore
it
out
of
the
gathers
by
jove
didn
t
she
look
daggers
at
me
but
she
trundled
it
off
the
floor
after
what
a
memory
you
have
said
the
girl
laughing
i
remember
sat
out
a
dance
and
you
told
me
about
some
signally
talented
yearlings
and
this
foal
who
had
such
a
brilliant
am
proud
of
him
i
shall
kiss
the
star
on
his
forehead
when
i
see
you
remember
he
has
a
star
you
had
much
better
let
me
take
it
to
that
i
would
give
it
to
him
now
ted
if
you
are
too
bold
i
shall
return
to
my
no
no
you
wouldn
t
have
the
heart
to
do
that
you
can
always
go
to
your
books
while
i
am
mostly
three
hundred
and
fifty
miles
away
how
many
months
is
it
since
i
saw
you
last
oh
two
or
three
i
it
was
in
july
nearly
six
months
ago
and
you
then
said
you
would
most
likely
come
to
laurette
s
in
november
but
you
didn
t
you
wouldn
t
come
to
the
cup
and
you
wouldn
t
drop
me
a
line
to
say
you
were
glad
about
to
avoid
giving
me
a
chance
now
don
t
make
your
eyes
big
as
if
you
didn
t
take
in
what
i
say
why
don
t
you
ask
me
what
chance
well
then
what
chance
returned
the
young
lady
laughing
but
with
a
heightened
colour
to
once
more
ask
you
to
marry
only
once
more
then
after
that
we
may
be
fast
not
at
shall
be
man
and
oh
ted
well
i
suppose
we
could
hardly
be
they
smiled
in
each
other
s
faces
but
the
young
man
soon
became
grave
stella
how
often
have
i
asked
you
to
marry
me
do
you
mean
counting
from
the
very
beginning
or
since
we
have
grown
up
i
don
t
think
it
s
fair
for
you
always
to
poke
borax
at
me
why
don
t
you
be
serious
i
don
t
like
being
serious
i
have
been
to
church
once
already
the
proper
way
to
spend
a
hot
sunday
is
to
be
like
chaff
that
the
storm
carrieth
what
do
you
mean
by
that
is
it
another
parable
i
mean
to
lie
in
a
hammock
in
the
west
veranda
and
think
whatever
idle
thoughts
choose
to
come
into
your
head
or
read
your
favourite
poets
or
listen
to
a
bird
on
a
branch
hard
by
do
you
hear
that
swallow
in
the
top
of
the
moreton
bay
they
were
silent
for
a
few
minutes
and
the
liquid
melodious
carols
of
the
little
minstrel
filled
the
air
but
i
would
much
sooner
listen
to
you
than
to
that
little
rubbish
said
the
young
man
in
an
emphatic
tone
oh
what
bad
taste
wouldn
t
you
like
to
know
what
it
really
feels
like
to
float
in
the
air
like
a
sunbeam
asked
the
girl
mischievously
he
only
flies
and
sings
for
his
can
get
mine
without
that
besides
i
would
sooner
be
on
the
earth
near
you
than
anywhere
you
could
mention
stella
it
was
close
to
this
very
spot
i
first
asked
you
to
be
my
wife
when
we
were
both
of
an
age
to
marry
do
you
remember
it
the
girl
looked
at
her
companion
with
undisguised
amusement
i
should
think
i
did
you
were
barely
and
you
were
nearly
very
good
age
for
both
considering
i
had
been
left
my
own
master
twelve
months
before
with
twelve
thousand
a
year
what
more
did
we
want
a
little
wisdom
a
little
love
a
little
sympathy
and
power
of
that
we
ought
to
have
do
you
mean
that
i
didn
t
love
you
enough
or
didn
t
know
my
own
mind
but
surely
marriage
is
the
sort
of
bargain
which
needs
two
to
make
it
well
at
any
rate
you
refused
me
out
and
out
then
and
you
were
as
solemn
as
if
you
were
going
into
a
convent
larry
always
declares
you
were
thinking
of
doing
it
then
i
know
you
had
a
picture
of
the
virgin
and
said
she
was
our
advocate
and
talked
about
the
soul
and
all
sorts
of
papist
to
make
a
protestant
s
hair
did
your
hair
creep
and
how
did
you
know
you
were
a
protestant
because
you
never
go
to
church
i
suppose
that
s
neither
here
nor
there
but
now
do
you
remember
the
second
time
i
asked
you
a
quick
wave
of
colour
swept
over
the
girl
s
face
ted
what
is
the
use
of
going
over
all
this
well
i
ll
go
over
you
check
me
if
i
make
a
mistake
it
was
eighteen
months
later
we
hadn
t
seen
each
other
for
nearly
a
year
you
were
in
the
garden
when
i
came
is
that
right
i
saw
your
mother
and
told
her
i
was
going
to
try
my
luck
again
and
she
said
i
had
her
consent
and
good
wishes
the
moment
you
saw
me
you
asked
if
any
gifted
colt
had
hit
his
leg
i
looked
so
serious
and
then
you
said
oh
you
are
going
to
be
foolish
again
and
you
were
and
i
was
still
more
you
knew
your
own
mind
and
i
didn
t
know
foolish
by
george
when
i
think
about
you
and
feel
rather
savage
i
remember
that
once
in
your
life
anyhow
you
were
good
and
sensible
and
that
s
the
day
you
promised
to
be
my
wife
and
sat
beside
me
in
the
arbour
of
spanish
reeds
with
the
scarlet
japonica
hanging
on
it
in
you
certainly
have
rather
a
dreadful
wore
a
dress
like
the
one
you
have
on
now
i
could
tell
you
every
word
you
by
heaven
i
could
tell
you
too
how
i
felt
a
week
afterwards
when
i
got
your
letter
at
strathhaye
breaking
it
all
off
and
saying
it
was
a
frightful
mistake
on
your
well
ted
do
you
want
me
to
say
again
how
sorry
i
am
do
you
want
me
to
grovel
in
the
dust
all
my
life
because
of
that
blunder
after
all
you
brought
it
on
yourself
by
being
so
persistent
when
i
was
in
rather
a
you
never
were
half
so
good
before
or
since
and
you
had
quite
got
rid
of
all
that
stuff
about
convents
and
you
must
not
speak
so
disrespectfully
of
these
well
you
know
very
well
you
may
have
any
notions
you
long
as
you
have
that
is
rather
a
strong
i
ll
make
it
much
stronger
if
you
ll
tell
me
how
you
don
t
suppose
it
does
a
fellow
any
good
to
come
a
cropper
like
that
do
you
why
three
months
afterwards
i
heard
you
were
going
to
be
married
to
miss
julia
morton
why
weren
t
you
i
did
try
to
like
it
were
only
to
vex
you
but
by
jove
when
she
began
to
be
in
earnest
i
found
the
shoe
was
on
the
wrong
foot
you
might
be
vexed
for
a
day
but
i
should
be
vexed
for
all
the
rest
of
my
what
makes
you
think
i
would
be
vexed
for
a
day
oh
just
because
i
ve
come
to
belong
to
a
sort
of
that
owl
and
the
little
gold
pistol
hanging
at
your
i
use
the
little
gold
pistol
to
wind
up
my
watch
with
and
the
owl
has
sparkling
ruby
eyes
into
which
i
look
in
church
when
i
am
very
tired
the
one
is
useful
and
the
other
beautiful
you
see
and
i
am
both
said
the
young
man
imperturbably
besides
i
can
give
you
whatever
money
will
you
but
then
you
see
you
would
be
always
yes
and
when
i
wouldn
t
be
about
you
would
nearly
cry
your
eyes
out
you
may
laugh
but
women
always
get
fonder
of
their
husbands
look
here
stella
you
said
yes
once
before
you
ll
have
to
say
it
again
and
stick
to
it
the
last
time
i
spoke
to
you
you
said
you
would
think
over
it
you
ve
had
plenty
of
time
you
re
close
on
a
girl
should
be
married
by
that
or
not
at
all
you
seem
to
forget
that
many
women
never
but
you
re
not
one
of
them
now
stella
look
me
in
the
face
and
tell
me
do
you
intend
to
be
an
old
maid
oh
one
doesn
t
intend
it
but
sometimes
circumstances
are
more
merciful
than
one
s
has
any
fellow
come
along
that
you
care
for
more
than
me
thank
the
lord
for
that
all
you
know
have
been
in
love
with
you
stein
wigram
lindsay
ted
you
really
are
too
absurd
don
t
you
think
it
is
wrong
to
trifle
away
the
precious
moments
that
never
come
back
again
ah
yes
they
do
when
i
ve
been
with
you
the
time
comes
back
over
and
over
again
besides
stella
how
can
you
call
it
trifling
when
i
ask
you
to
marry
me
will
you
no
thank
you
speak
just
as
if
i
offered
you
a
mouldy
bit
of
no
as
if
you
offered
me
some
rich
cake
for
which
i
have
no
what
if
you
did
not
get
another
chance
of
refusal
do
you
suppose
i
expect
you
to
turn
up
periodically
all
my
life
asking
me
if
i
am
game
to
come
out
with
you
into
the
garden
well
it
s
what
i
ll
do
unless
you
get
married
to
someone
or
unless
you
get
married
i
shall
never
marry
any
woman
but
stella
courtland
and
that
s
as
sure
as
my
name
is
edward
the
two
had
paused
in
their
pacings
to
and
fro
and
stood
facing
each
other
at
the
end
of
the
vine
arcade
furthest
from
the
house
close
to
a
great
white
fortuniana
thickly
covered
over
with
roses
and
buds
in
all
stages
of
unclosing
the
girl
was
tall
and
very
finely
formed
her
face
in
repose
was
apt
to
be
rather
cold
and
pale
the
eyes
were
extremely
large
deep
and
liquid
when
we
try
to
describe
eyes
or
flowers
we
find
that
language
is
extremely
destitute
in
precise
colour
terms
they
were
dark
is
perhaps
the
term
that
most
nearly
approximates
to
the
hue
of
this
girl
s
eyes
and
as
that
tint
in
the
waves
is
subject
to
rapid
changes
to
deepening
intensity
and
gleaming
flashes
of
paler
light
so
did
those
bewitching
orbs
reflect
each
passing
emotion
they
were
as
sensitive
to
her
moods
as
the
surface
of
water
is
to
the
sky
s
influence
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
their
range
of
expression
was
infinite
the
same
might
be
said
of
the
whole
countenance
when
moved
or
animated
it
glowed
and
sparkled
as
if
a
light
shone
through
it
the
brow
was
singularly
noble
and
gave
promise
of
unusual
mental
power
the
complexion
was
very
fair
and
clear
and
when
she
talked
it
was
often
tinged
with
swift
delicate
that
died
away
very
slowly
leaving
a
soft
warm
glow
in
the
cheeks
like
that
often
seen
in
a
moist
it
was
a
face
whose
every
line
and
feature
indicated
that
stella
was
endowed
with
rare
qualities
of
intellect
and
imagination
quick
to
feel
to
see
to
think
and
yet
a
very
woman
far
from
indifferent
to
admiration
and
the
sense
of
power
that
the
homage
of
men
gives
a
girl
yet
withal
liable
to
that
quick
disdain
of
the
more
frivolous
aspects
of
life
which
to
those
who
understood
but
one
side
of
her
complex
nature
appeared
in
the
light
of
wilful
caprice
she
made
a
captivating
picture
as
she
stood
under
the
thick
woof
of
clustering
grapes
and
that
threw
flickering
shadows
over
her
head
with
its
abundant
coils
of
silky
hair
which
had
a
slight
wave
and
was
of
that
deep
colour
that
is
seldom
retained
after
childhood
the
young
man
was
in
a
not
uncommon
and
distinctly
unintellectual
way
he
was
close
on
six
feet
in
height
with
a
athletic
figure
a
face
inclining
to
be
florid
the
forehead
was
low
and
square
the
eyes
the
hair
lighter
in
tone
cut
close
but
crisply
curling
to
the
roots
the
nose
was
thick
but
straight
and
well
defined
the
jaws
were
too
heavy
and
the
lips
partly
concealed
under
a
heavy
drooping
moustache
were
altogether
it
was
the
face
of
a
man
who
could
be
firm
and
determined
in
action
yet
morally
lacking
in
force
of
will
the
contrast
between
the
two
faces
in
form
development
and
expression
was
so
striking
that
a
casual
onlooker
might
conclude
there
was
that
essential
difference
of
nature
and
temperament
which
might
somehow
form
a
basis
for
marriage
this
impression
would
be
strengthened
by
a
lurking
air
of
indecision
in
the
young
woman
s
face
as
her
companion
delivered
his
resolve
in
a
voice
that
well
carried
out
the
robust
air
of
knowing
what
he
wanted
and
a
determination
to
compass
it
which
was
conveyed
by
his
general
demeanour
i
don
t
know
whether
i
should
say
that
i
am
sorry
or
glad
you
are
going
to
be
a
bachelor
she
said
reflectively
will
you
grow
very
thin
and
cross
or
stout
and
the
worst
of
it
is
if
you
get
stout
you
will
hobble
and
have
a
bad
toe
it
will
be
really
gout
you
know
but
you
ll
call
it
a
sprain
or
something
and
then
when
you
come
to
see
me
you
will
tread
on
dear
dustiefoot
s
paws
i
suppose
i
may
be
a
little
deaf
by
that
time
ah
i
can
never
bear
to
think
of
growing
old
or
dying
and
stella
stopped
abruptly
with
a
little
shrug
of
the
shoulders
why
didn
t
you
finish
your
fancy
sketch
if
you
were
a
little
deaf
i
would
bawl
at
you
do
you
remember
that
sunday
in
december
when
the
garden
was
full
of
roses
and
that
little
beggar
of
a
bird
was
singing
and
then
you
d
say
ah
ted
why
didn
t
we
get
married
when
we
were
young
you
know
stella
you
ll
have
to
give
way
in
the
end
twice
you
ve
named
a
horse
for
me
and
twice
it
s
turned
out
most
lucky
now
tell
we
had
been
married
this
morning
at
church
what
would
you
think
the
very
worst
part
of
the
concern
that
you
wouldn
t
drive
to
the
and
set
off
for
well
that
s
flat
i
often
wonder
what
makes
me
so
ridiculously
soft
about
you
stella
you
say
such
horrid
things
to
me
while
every
other
girl
i
come
now
ted
if
you
boast
your
very
last
fragment
of
a
chance
is
oh
i
have
got
a
fragment
of
a
chance
then
come
that
s
the
best
thing
you
ve
said
yet
look
here
stella
have
you
ever
been
in
love
now
honour
bright
well
with
people
in
but
how
the
deuce
could
you
be
in
love
with
people
in
books
oh
i
assure
you
they
are
far
the
nicest
people
to
fall
in
love
because
you
can
put
them
on
a
shelf
and
leave
them
yes
that
is
one
great
charm
it
is
partly
what
ruins
life
the
way
people
see
so
much
of
each
other
till
they
know
each
other
by
heart
up
and
their
stories
that
once
were
funny
their
pet
theories
their
stupid
what
are
idiosyncrasies
let
me
see
it
is
your
idiosyncrasy
to
wish
to
marry
it
is
mine
to
think
it
too
dangerous
an
fancy
calling
it
an
idiosyncrasy
when
a
fellow
is
spoony
but
i
expect
that
is
not
the
dictionary
meaning
well
you
are
all
but
and
you
have
not
been
in
love
you
may
depend
if
you
are
not
heels
over
head
before
you
are
twenty
you
never
will
be
so
you
may
as
well
save
waiting
any
the
girl
laughed
out
loud
well
ted
you
are
the
first
i
have
heard
use
inability
to
love
as
an
argument
for
getting
married
you
are
really
very
oh
a
fellow
is
always
very
humble
when
he
s
up
to
the
hilt
in
it
is
afterwards
when
the
fair
is
over
that
he
isn
t
quite
so
meek
and
well
you
wouldn
t
have
him
be
a
humble
jackass
at
a
distance
all
through
it
s
too
much
like
making
your
dinner
off
peaches
besides
a
girl
like
you
always
has
her
own
way
hand
over
fist
single
or
married
and
when
to
that
you
add
ever
so
many
thousands
a
always
when
you
have
been
to
melbourne
you
harp
more
and
more
on
your
maybe
you
see
the
more
you
see
of
the
world
the
more
you
find
how
much
people
think
of
money
and
how
much
it
gets
for
and
yet
to
be
poor
in
the
midst
of
riches
is
the
worst
kind
of
but
you
see
said
the
young
man
eagerly
misinterpreting
the
drift
of
this
remark
strathhaye
is
none
of
your
big
leasehold
affairs
it
s
nearly
all
good
deal
of
it
fit
to
carry
three
or
four
sheep
to
the
never
a
cockatoo
nor
a
free
selector
dare
show
his
oh
i
feel
as
if
i
knew
every
inch
of
strathhaye
well
a
good
tale
is
none
the
worse
for
being
twice
told
besides
i
am
coming
to
the
point
you
might
marry
for
love
and
in
a
few
months
find
you
were
quite
insolvent
in
the
to
pay
a
bob
in
the
pound
or
even
an
utter
bankrupt
such
things
yes
there
was
your
friend
cicely
oh
please
don
t
said
stella
in
a
tone
of
quick
pain
well
not
speaking
of
things
doesn
t
make
them
different
you
know
how
completely
gone
she
was
on
the
man
she
married
and
in
less
than
three
years
she
ran
off
with
another
fellow
and
that
was
less
immoral
than
staying
with
the
man
she
married
said
stella
a
hard
expression
coming
into
her
face
still
it
isn
t
what
people
mean
to
do
when
they
marry
for
love
you
see
the
point
is
that
you
may
fall
as
completely
out
of
love
as
you
may
fall
into
it
but
you
can
t
wake
up
one
morning
to
find
eighty
thousand
acres
arable
land
freehold
all
gone
to
kingdom
come
like
a
rainbow
may
i
smoke
a
cigarette
yes
what
a
pretty
case
and
what
elegant
little
cigarettes
they
ought
to
be
do
you
know
what
they
cost
each
oh
heavens
you
are
going
to
be
just
like
cr
oe
sus
henway
always
telling
the
price
of
or
you
might
say
like
my
father
he
likes
to
mention
the
figure
that
things
cost
still
i
might
easily
take
after
a
worse
old
boy
than
the
governor
though
mind
you
i
don
t
mean
to
go
into
parliament
ever
and
give
ninety
affghanistan
camels
for
an
exploring
expedition
and
get
a
handle
tacked
to
my
name
because
they
came
on
a
desert
a
hundred
miles
by
you
re
like
a
good
many
more
australians
you
ll
never
do
as
much
for
your
native
land
as
your
fathers
did
for
their
adopted
oh
i
don
t
know
i
ve
half
a
dozen
gold
medals
for
my
wool
and
my
horses
are
the
best
in
the
district
but
ll
put
my
foot
in
it
again
if
i
say
much
more
would
you
like
me
to
be
sir
edward
ritchie
stella
like
the
old
man
surely
that
is
a
very
foolish
question
to
ask
me
of
all
i
am
not
so
sure
about
edward
and
lady
ritchie
if
you
really
have
any
fancy
for
the
title
i
might
give
another
big
dose
of
camels
to
the
government
there
s
plenty
more
desert
to
be
opened
up
for
selectors
to
perish
your
speaking
of
the
desert
reminds
me
that
i
am
getting
parched
with
thirst
there
must
be
some
afternoon
tea
going
on
by
this
time
haven
t
we
been
here
a
good
while
about
five
minutes
i
don
t
care
for
tea
but
i
ll
go
and
get
a
split
soda
for
myself
and
bring
you
a
cup
oh
if
we
go
inside
you
won
t
come
out
we
haven
t
settled
anything
yet
but
here
comes
kirsty
with
a
kirsty
was
a
tall
spare
woman
who
was
getting
to
be
more
than
but
whose
active
vigorous
ways
forbade
the
imputation
of
old
age
she
was
invariably
attired
in
black
a
snowy
cap
apron
collars
and
cuffs
and
a
face
in
which
all
the
cardinal
virtues
ran
riot
but
it
was
withal
tempered
by
a
certain
severity
of
expression
that
would
seem
to
be
seldom
absent
from
the
bearing
of
trusted
scotch
servants
who
have
lived
nearly
all
their
lives
in
one
family
i
hae
brought
your
pet
chiny
teapot
miss
stella
said
kirsty
putting
the
tray
down
on
a
little
wicker
table
that
was
fixed
beside
a
rustic
bench
in
the
arcade
and
tom
bade
me
ask
ye
sir
whether
ye
wadna
rather
hae
a
glass
o
soda
water
yes
if
you
please
kirsty
but
tell
tom
to
draw
it
where
is
maisie
or
sarah
kirsty
asked
stella
as
she
poured
herself
out
a
cup
of
tea
you
shouldn
t
be
attending
on
us
here
when
we
really
ought
to
go
weel
miss
stella
ye
see
there
s
whiles
when
people
disna
want
ither
folk
aboot
answered
kirsty
with
a
demure
smile
sarah
s
gone
to
mile
end
to
see
her
aunt
as
for
maisie
i
ve
set
her
to
learn
a
page
o
the
shorter
catechism
she
used
to
ken
every
question
in
it
but
ye
suld
hear
her
when
i
pit
a
few
till
her
it
s
just
awfu
hoo
this
climate
seems
to
be
against
proper
grounding
in
the
poor
maisie
said
stella
with
a
smile
fancy
learning
a
page
of
the
shorter
catechism
on
a
day
like
this
she
fanned
herself
softly
with
a
wide
pink
satin
fan
tipped
with
marabout
feathers
and
slowly
sipped
her
tea
what
is
the
shorter
catechism
when
it
is
at
home
asked
the
young
man
who
was
sitting
near
the
girl
and
watching
her
every
movement
oh
it
s
just
a
little
scotch
book
full
of
questions
and
answers
about
things
people
are
supposed
to
don
what
sort
of
questions
the
first
is
what
is
the
chief
end
of
man
now
what
answer
would
you
give
to
that
being
in
a
garden
with
the
girl
who
won
t
have
will
some
no
but
in
a
general
way
what
do
you
think
is
the
chief
end
of
man
what
he
should
most
live
for
ritchie
knitted
his
brows
for
a
moment
well
i
should
say
it
is
to
sell
on
the
rise
and
have
a
good
sell
on
the
rise
yes
if
you
sell
on
the
rise
you
make
a
pot
of
money
if
you
don
t
the
other
fellow
collars
the
tin
now
what
is
the
answer
in
the
catechism
the
answer
is
that
the
chief
end
of
man
is
to
glorify
god
and
to
enjoy
him
for
but
of
course
that
means
when
people
get
to
but
why
should
they
get
to
heaven
if
they
do
nothing
to
deserve
it
well
there
you
ask
me
a
question
ah
here
comes
kirsty
with
my
seltzer
here
s
to
you
many
of
them
said
ritchie
clinking
stella
s
cup
with
his
tall
tumbler
and
tossing
off
half
its
contents
at
a
draught
what
a
pretty
pale
amber
colour
is
that
ordinary
soda
water
asked
stella
yes
ordinary
soda
not
ordinary
old
irish
whisky
i
d
back
your
brother
tom
s
judgment
in
that
article
against
any
man
s
have
a
little
nip
it
s
ever
so
much
better
than
tea
i
say
stella
why
does
the
old
i
her
daughter
to
learn
such
stuff
ted
i
am
afraid
you
are
almost
a
heathen
do
you
ever
read
the
bible
well
i
sometimes
begin
to
read
it
on
sunday
evening
after
a
game
or
two
at
billiards
but
i
generally
drop
off
to
sleep
i
seem
as
if
i
always
knew
what
was
i
wonder
how
much
you
really
know
of
it
oh
lots
you
try
ask
me
about
noah
or
any
of
those
old
then
what
can
you
tell
me
about
noah
ah
noah
well
he
was
the
one
that
put
all
the
insects
into
an
ark
and
drank
too
much
wine
and
was
going
to
put
a
knife
into
his
son
esau
till
the
ram
called
out
here
am
i
if
he
had
been
a
proper
prize
animal
he
d
never
have
given
himself
away
like
that
well
what
are
you
laughing
at
oh
ted
ted
then
what
about
abraham
abraham
was
one
of
those
fellows
that
was
always
getting
into
a
fix
because
he
didn
t
leave
his
wife
at
home
it
shows
how
wrong
it
is
for
a
man
to
take
his
wife
and
isaac
what
about
him
well
he
was
about
as
sly
as
a
jew
pawnbroker
he
put
on
a
kangaroo
skin
or
something
so
as
to
get
a
mess
of
porridge
but
he
didn
t
make
much
out
of
it
for
he
got
put
into
a
fiery
furnace
no
it
was
a
and
how
many
sons
had
he
well
there
was
jacob
and
a
thundering
lot
more
but
ten
of
them
got
lost
you
ten
you
can
t
expect
me
to
know
names
one
of
an
awful
swell
coat
he
went
down
into
egypt
but
i
never
could
swallow
all
the
yarn
about
him
do
you
think
you
ought
to
laugh
so
much
at
things
out
of
the
bible
ted
do
you
really
think
all
that
is
in
the
scriptures
i
bet
you
it
is
and
a
lot
far
more
unlikely
yes
i
d
lay
you
all
i
hope
to
make
when
next
i
sell
on
the
rise
you
couldn
t
ask
me
much
in
the
old
testament
i
wouldn
t
give
you
an
answer
to
said
ritchie
with
the
elation
of
a
man
who
has
passed
a
creditable
examination
but
what
things
do
you
sell
i
thought
you
sent
your
wool
to
london
and
sold
your
surplus
stock
to
as
my
brothers
do
at
oh
i
don
t
mean
station
stuff
i
mean
shares
of
all
kinds
gold
in
victoria
silver
in
new
south
wales
rubies
copper
and
tin
in
south
australia
opals
in
queensland
pearls
in
western
australia
i
have
had
a
share
in
a
pearling
boat
at
shark
s
bay
for
two
seasons
i
mean
to
show
you
a
specimen
of
the
pearls
before
long
but
after
all
no
speculation
comes
up
to
betting
on
thoroughbreds
that
go
flashing
by
with
a
on
them
but
you
know
it
strikes
me
that
no
one
with
a
lot
of
money
gets
such
a
curly
out
of
betting
or
plunging
as
those
that
put
their
last
copper
on
something
they
know
nothing
about
and
then
hold
their
breath
till
they
see
whether
they
go
to
gaol
or
make
a
well
this
is
very
edifying
it
seems
the
great
thing
in
selling
on
the
rise
is
to
rob
your
neighbour
and
have
some
excitement
i
had
no
idea
you
were
such
a
oh
a
fellow
must
do
something
as
for
wool
and
sheep
you
shear
your
flocks
and
ship
the
wool
off
the
sheep
are
turned
into
the
paddocks
and
begin
to
grow
their
next
clip
and
the
london
market
goes
up
or
down
a
few
farthings
in
the
pound
it
s
all
as
slow
as
a
were
you
ever
at
a
christening
yes
i
was
worse
luck
and
stood
godfather
too
you
a
godfather
oh
ted
this
is
too
ridiculous
well
i
thought
it
meant
just
to
give
the
little
beggar
a
silver
pot
and
a
now
and
then
but
it
appears
you
tell
the
most
barefaced
crammers
about
renouncing
the
devil
and
all
his
work
it
seems
to
me
the
moment
you
have
anything
to
do
with
the
church
you
have
to
tell
lies
till
you
re
black
in
the
and
who
is
the
happy
babe
that
may
be
left
to
your
spiritual
guidance
why
henrietta
s
last
baby
she
s
john
morton
s
wife
you
know
aren
t
we
somehow
related
through
the
mortons
you
see
my
sister
is
married
to
john
morton
and
your
brother
claude
is
married
to
helen
morton
john
s
sister
now
what
relation
am
i
to
you
oh
the
relation
that
should
sit
a
little
further
away
we
always
come
back
to
talking
of
well
there
s
nothing
else
half
so
interesting
by
the
way
i
was
coming
part
of
the
way
from
melbourne
with
dick
emberly
and
he
said
your
brother
cuthbert
was
going
to
take
charge
of
a
congregation
in
one
of
the
melbourne
suburbs
i
didn
t
know
he
was
a
yes
he
was
ordained
three
months
ago
he
is
going
to
take
a
congregation
at
hawthorne
for
some
months
for
a
clergyman
who
has
fallen
oh
now
you
ll
come
to
melbourne
larry
said
she
would
make
you
come
for
part
of
the
season
have
you
seen
her
yet
since
she
came
to
my
father
s
no
she
called
the
other
day
but
i
was
out
she
left
word
that
she
wanted
to
see
me
particularly
and
i
meant
to
call
one
day
this
week
how
does
her
husband
go
on
now
oh
much
as
usual
it
s
always
head
you
lose
tail
i
win
with
a
man
like
the
hon
talbot
tareling
no
member
of
the
british
nobility
as
larry
was
so
fond
of
calling
it
that
i
ve
known
in
the
colonies
has
much
idea
about
money
but
to
grab
as
much
as
possible
without
doing
a
stroke
of
well
i
can
not
help
liking
tareling
he
has
such
very
good
manners
and
he
is
very
you
see
it
s
all
he
s
got
to
show
for
himself
and
for
being
descended
from
goodness
knows
how
many
lords
and
for
having
an
uncle
a
and
his
elder
brother
married
to
the
daughter
of
a
duke
lord
how
larry
used
to
cram
them
all
down
our
throats
till
we
found
out
to
our
cost
what
an
expensive
trick
it
is
to
have
a
sister
marry
into
the
british
nobility
look
here
stella
shall
you
be
in
afternoon
because
if
so
larry
will
drive
across
and
settle
when
you
ll
come
then
you
see
you
can
t
get
out
of
it
now
that
cuthbert
is
to
be
in
oh
let
me
see
i
ll
have
to
consult
my
mother
and
decide
about
all
sorts
of
things
you
see
i
ve
promised
to
go
to
lullaboolagana
in
may
or
very
well
take
melbourne
on
the
way
i
am
going
to
see
the
old
people
this
evening
and
i
shall
tell
didn
t
you
come
from
godolphin
house
no
you
see
when
i
got
in
by
the
last
night
i
went
with
one
or
two
other
fellows
straight
to
the
club
then
i
didn
t
get
up
very
early
and
so
i
came
direct
here
to
see
when
did
you
see
your
parents
last
oh
about
six
months
same
time
as
i
saw
you
well
and
the
way
your
poor
mother
dotes
on
only
boy
why
do
people
think
it
is
a
blessing
to
have
children
very
often
it
seems
one
of
the
bitter
pleasures
of
well
you
see
if
people
didn
t
think
things
were
a
little
better
than
they
are
the
world
wouldn
t
gee
up
at
all
and
doesn
t
it
say
even
in
the
bible
that
a
man
shall
leave
his
father
and
mother
and
cleave
to
his
wife
then
how
much
more
will
he
do
it
for
the
girl
who
doesn
t
want
to
be
his
wife
ted
your
logic
is
you
may
call
it
logic
if
you
it
s
which
logic
seldom
is
but
then
it
s
correct
and
you
can
so
seldom
combine
the
two
said
stella
in
the
light
mocking
tone
which
came
to
her
so
readily
i
declare
i
ve
nearly
emptied
my
teapot
it
is
fatal
to
begin
to
drink
on
a
day
like
yes
the
more
you
drink
the
more
you
want
s
the
mischief
of
it
said
the
young
man
with
a
gloomier
expression
than
the
occasion
seemed
to
call
for
by
jove
i
nearly
forgot
i
had
this
for
you
stella
he
said
presently
taking
a
small
parcel
out
of
his
breast
sealed
and
addressed
as
it
had
come
by
post
you
re
always
interested
about
the
niggers
myers
my
is
a
great
dab
at
finding
things
out
about
them
by
the
way
he
corresponds
with
your
old
friend
stein
well
some
time
ago
myers
fossicked
out
about
a
very
rum
sort
of
shoe
that
the
blacks
use
on
particular
occasions
i
told
him
to
get
me
one
if
he
could
and
when
i
got
to
the
club
last
night
i
found
this
waiting
for
me
oh
it
s
over
three
weeks
since
i
left
strathhaye
i
ve
been
in
melbourne
and
other
let
me
open
it
cried
stella
i
love
unfastening
an
unknown
parcel
it
is
one
of
the
simple
pleasures
of
life
that
never
palls
oh
ted
what
a
cunning
sort
of
thing
she
said
as
the
shoe
was
revealed
to
view
it
was
light
and
compressible
into
a
very
small
compass
the
sole
was
composed
of
emu
feathers
matted
together
with
a
dull
red
coagulated
substance
the
upper
part
was
a
sort
of
network
of
small
plaited
strands
crossed
and
recrossed
this
curious
shoe
was
extremely
crude
in
shape
being
exactly
alike
at
both
ends
why
ted
this
is
hair
cried
stella
after
examining
the
net
closely
and
touching
the
plaited
strands
which
had
still
a
dull
gloss
woman
s
ah
only
a
woman
s
hair
how
strangely
wicked
this
shoe
begins
to
look
not
a
scrap
of
difference
between
the
heel
and
the
yet
one
could
tell
it
is
meant
for
a
shoe
and
it
looks
as
if
it
would
keep
well
on
the
foot
let
me
see
how
it
would
stella
quickly
slipped
off
her
own
shoe
and
put
on
the
aboriginal
one
put
it
off
put
it
off
i
can
t
bear
to
see
it
on
you
cried
the
young
man
vehemently
but
the
girl
merely
laughed
and
walked
a
few
steps
and
found
that
this
curious
covering
for
the
foot
though
much
too
large
yet
clung
to
it
with
strange
tenacity
do
you
know
that
it
is
the
most
unlucky
thing
you
could
do
said
the
young
man
quite
gravely
really
said
stella
smiling
at
the
sombre
tone
of
conviction
in
which
he
spoke
well
give
me
my
own
shoe
ted
can
put
it
ritchie
half
reluctantly
returned
the
pretty
little
bronze
shoe
with
its
silver
buckle
and
dainty
bow
and
then
took
up
the
aboriginal
one
now
do
you
know
what
this
is
called
and
what
it
is
used
for
he
said
holding
it
at
full
length
on
his
outspread
palm
no
but
i
am
dying
to
know
for
i
never
before
heard
that
any
of
our
blacks
made
any
attempt
at
shoeing
themselves
could
they
walk
far
in
a
thing
of
that
kind
far
enough
for
their
purposes
i
dare
say
returned
ritchie
grimly
that
is
a
kooditcha
shoe
and
a
black
fellow
never
puts
a
pair
of
them
on
except
when
he
steals
at
night
upon
an
enemy
to
kill
oh
ted
are
you
making
that
up
to
give
me
what
you
call
a
curly
oh
but
you
ve
not
heard
all
yet
do
you
see
that
reddish
stuff
holding
the
feathers
together
well
that
is
human
how
horrible
i
wish
i
had
not
put
it
on
said
the
girl
with
a
little
shiver
it
really
has
an
look
and
such
strange
sombre
you
see
it
would
make
no
more
track
than
a
butterfly
and
nothing
to
show
it
was
on
a
foot
the
blacks
say
they
can
track
anything
that
walks
or
crawls
from
a
horse
to
a
young
snake
but
not
a
ghost
or
an
enemy
in
kooditcha
well
of
all
the
myths
i
have
gathered
about
the
blacks
none
are
so
dramatic
as
this
relic
thank
you
so
much
for
getting
it
for
well
i
m
glad
you
like
it
i
wouldn
t
touch
the
thing
with
a
pair
of
tongs
for
my
own
human
blood
and
a
woman
s
hair
i
wonder
if
anyone
ever
wore
this
to
creep
up
to
a
tribal
foe
at
midnight
but
why
did
you
say
it
was
unlucky
to
put
it
on
well
the
blacks
say
if
you
put
one
on
and
don
t
kill
anybody
you
ll
live
to
wish
someone
had
killed
clearly
the
only
thing
for
me
to
do
is
to
kill
someone
who
shall
it
be
asked
stella
with
mock
gravity
well
i
d
offer
myself
but
you
did
for
me
long
why
ted
you
are
getting
quite
oh
i
can
t
make
a
stew
of
my
heart
and
put
it
into
a
letter
like
some
fellows
but
look
here
stella
ah
here
comes
cuthbert
by
jove
he
looks
almost
like
a
bishop
the
newcomer
cuthbert
lionel
courtland
was
three
years
older
than
his
sister
he
was
a
young
clergyman
with
perhaps
something
of
the
of
demeanour
that
may
sometimes
be
observable
in
those
that
have
recently
entered
on
the
sacred
calling
he
had
the
brow
that
was
a
characteristic
of
the
courtland
family
dark
gray
eyes
something
like
stella
s
in
expression
and
a
mouth
that
helped
largely
to
convey
the
calm
sunny
expression
which
marked
his
face
the
two
young
men
greeted
each
other
as
old
acquaintances
you
re
a
parson
courtland
since
i
last
saw
you
i
suppose
i
ought
to
congratulate
you
but
you
re
not
quite
sure
ritchie
well
i
ll
take
the
for
the
the
fact
is
i
never
know
what
to
say
before
a
parson
and
though
we
ve
been
kiddies
together
i
don
t
believe
i
can
forget
after
this
you
belong
to
the
cloth
the
white
choker
and
that
makes
you
look
somehow
as
if
you
had
belonged
to
the
clergy
all
your
well
shall
i
put
a
spotted
necktie
on
old
acquaintance
sake
laughed
the
young
clergyman
oh
i
m
just
going
thank
you
stella
has
been
blowing
me
up
for
not
being
with
my
parents
there
s
a
little
filly
i
ve
had
sent
to
my
father
s
for
you
to
ride
stella
may
i
come
and
take
you
out
on
tuesday
morning
stella
hesitated
and
then
consented
to
the
arrangement
the
brother
and
sister
accompanied
their
guest
to
the
house
where
he
made
his
adieus
to
the
rest
of
the
family
he
then
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
away
ii
the
brother
and
sister
returned
to
the
arcade
cuthbert
was
the
first
to
speak
stella
there
is
a
question
i
want
to
ask
and
i
m
almost
afraid
to
put
the
girl
looked
up
quickly
and
then
a
smile
slowly
crept
over
her
face
dear
darling
boy
don
t
be
afraid
to
ask
me
if
they
were
lighted
matches
that
might
fall
into
has
anything
special
passed
between
you
and
ritchie
have
you
accepted
him
then
why
do
you
go
out
riding
with
him
on
tuesday
because
i
haven
t
accepted
stella
dear
don
t
trifle
about
this
is
it
fair
to
him
i
think
it
s
not
only
fair
but
generous
he
asks
me
to
marry
him
i
can
not
make
up
my
mind
to
do
so
at
present
in
the
meantime
i
bind
up
his
wounded
spirit
with
the
balm
of
yes
that
s
it
you
refuse
him
time
after
not
invariably
do
not
blame
me
too
severely
you
see
i
have
tried
all
the
recognised
modes
of
treating
a
lover
i
have
refused
him
and
accepted
him
and
sometimes
done
neither
when
he
has
asked
me
for
a
stone
i
give
him
nourishment
of
occasional
social
intercourse
instead
of
the
terrible
disillusion
of
all
this
may
be
very
well
from
a
comedy
point
of
view
but
remember
it
is
not
for
the
amusement
of
a
passing
hour
that
a
man
persists
in
asking
a
woman
to
be
his
wife
year
after
no
but
still
dear
remember
how
much
more
amusing
it
is
than
if
she
had
married
him
the
first
time
of
but
now
let
me
ask
you
seriously
what
is
to
be
the
end
of
it
all
i
can
not
understand
you
in
the
least
stella
in
this
matter
to
begin
with
it
is
a
mystery
to
me
that
you
should
find
pleasure
in
ted
s
society
and
yet
i
believe
you
ah
cuth
you
haven
t
heard
ted
give
an
account
of
the
bible
patriarchs
the
girl
burst
into
a
peal
of
laughter
so
infectiously
merry
that
her
brother
was
forced
to
smile
as
for
asking
what
is
to
be
the
end
of
it
all
why
that
is
a
question
we
keep
on
asking
as
long
as
people
live
and
most
of
all
when
they
yet
people
must
decide
something
in
a
rough
and
ready
fashion
you
have
allowed
yourself
to
drift
into
a
very
undesirable
position
you
refuse
to
marry
there
i
at
least
feel
you
are
right
but
i
think
you
are
wrong
to
go
out
riding
with
him
for
it
gives
him
hope
that
in
the
end
you
may
change
your
and
so
i
may
if
i
could
only
be
sure
that
he
would
be
always
as
amusing
as
he
was
well
i
suppose
sex
must
count
for
something
when
a
certain
friendship
has
subsisted
since
childhood
between
a
young
man
and
woman
i
must
say
that
to
me
the
chief
quality
of
ritchie
s
conversation
is
a
perhaps
of
there
is
more
than
that
there
is
a
direct
appeal
to
life
as
it
presents
itself
to
him
and
when
we
have
all
tacitly
agreed
to
blink
so
much
the
trait
has
a
certain
least
to
i
could
understand
that
so
much
better
if
ted
s
point
of
view
were
not
essentially
that
of
the
average
sensual
man
pardon
me
dear
if
i
say
anything
that
vexes
you
must
not
forget
that
i
have
never
been
in
love
with
well
that
troubles
me
sometimes
more
than
if
you
isn
t
that
just
slightly
contradictory
perhaps
it
may
be
but
what
i
mean
is
that
if
you
could
really
be
in
love
with
him
and
married
him
you
might
transform
him
but
if
you
marry
him
without
being
in
i
fear
that
one
or
both
may
fall
over
a
why
cuthbert
you
must
have
been
reading
tragedy
what
makes
you
think
so
because
it
is
only
tragedy
which
is
so
merciful
in
finishing
us
up
in
a
speedy
impressive
manner
when
things
go
wrong
till
at
last
the
ghosts
have
to
come
on
the
stage
to
explain
how
people
fell
over
a
every
word
you
say
there
makes
me
feel
afresh
how
disastrous
it
would
be
for
you
to
risk
a
de
or
marriage
with
anyone
to
whom
you
could
not
look
up
in
some
measure
with
whom
you
would
not
have
that
deeper
mental
bond
without
which
marriage
in
some
cases
is
not
well
it
seems
to
me
that
marriage
of
all
subjects
is
the
one
that
most
eludes
dogmatizing
about
to
any
successful
i
admit
that
but
the
more
difficult
a
position
is
the
more
one
must
avoid
an
obvious
to
save
the
soul
says
one
of
the
old
spanish
saints
it
is
necessary
to
have
as
little
intercourse
with
people
as
possible
please
don
t
say
that
in
order
to
be
happy
in
marriage
the
same
axiom
applies
for
you
are
quite
capable
of
proving
it
said
the
young
man
laughingly
did
you
ever
notice
a
funny
old
book
in
tarnished
gold
that
was
given
to
grandmother
loudon
on
her
called
letters
to
a
granddaughter
yes
i
never
read
it
but
i
always
understood
it
was
published
for
private
circulation
only
by
an
ancestress
of
our
oh
very
likely
it
is
full
of
the
acute
platitudes
i
find
crowding
to
my
pen
when
i
try
to
write
so
i
suppose
it
is
an
hereditary
strain
well
the
thinglet
is
divided
into
school
life
coming
out
betrothal
marriage
maternity
each
section
except
marriage
has
about
a
hundred
pages
devoted
to
it
but
under
marriage
there
are
only
five
or
six
pages
beginning
it
must
be
evident
to
my
dear
intelligent
young
female
friends
that
this
is
a
subject
on
which
every
woman
who
enters
the
holy
estate
must
be
left
to
make
her
own
special
reflections
they
can
not
be
anticipated
really
stella
said
her
brother
laughing
you
never
seem
to
look
into
an
old
unknown
book
without
finding
a
joke
in
do
you
call
that
a
joke
you
wouldn
t
if
you
had
turned
the
grandmother
s
letters
over
as
i
did
when
i
was
seriously
trying
to
make
up
my
mind
about
entering
the
holy
estate
but
the
old
woman
was
right
to
a
certain
extent
for
there
you
have
to
do
with
all
the
uncertainty
of
untried
depths
in
two
natures
brought
into
a
previously
unknown
relationship
who
can
tell
how
the
venture
is
to
turn
out
therefore
i
say
let
there
be
the
sympathy
of
two
responsive
natures
or
the
differences
that
arise
from
two
minds
consciously
yes
and
after
building
on
all
these
hopeful
auguries
you
find
the
result
a
failure
more
elaborate
than
the
ordinary
i
can
not
quite
make
out
why
you
are
so
radically
sceptical
on
the
subject
of
marriage
i
am
sure
a
great
many
of
those
we
know
most
intimately
have
made
harmonious
unions
ah
i
can
see
by
your
face
you
are
thinking
of
poor
dear
esther
certainly
that
marriage
turned
out
a
failure
though
at
first
it
promised
to
be
an
exceptionally
happy
one
but
at
any
rate
the
more
mistrustful
you
are
the
more
careful
you
should
be
not
to
run
risks
even
when
people
start
with
a
good
stock
of
affection
what
terrible
ruin
often
overtakes
them
there
was
your
poor
friend
it
is
curious
to
have
the
poor
woman
quoted
from
two
such
opposite
points
of
view
in
one
afternoon
well
at
this
moment
she
is
living
in
a
cottage
in
a
township
in
new
south
wales
where
her
husband
plays
the
harmonium
in
a
little
baptist
chapel
on
sundays
i
do
not
say
that
there
is
not
an
element
of
terrible
ruin
in
this
but
not
in
the
sense
you
her
husband
yes
as
soon
as
she
was
divorced
they
were
married
i
found
out
where
they
are
living
and
sent
some
help
at
a
time
when
she
badly
needed
it
we
have
corresponded
from
time
to
time
since
does
mother
know
this
stella
well
no
there
are
some
things
one
s
mother
should
be
spared
the
first
letter
i
had
was
too
of
course
i
know
you
used
to
be
very
fond
of
each
other
the
friendships
of
women
should
always
have
a
limit
i
admit
it
is
very
dangerous
to
find
out
how
things
have
really
happened
you
then
find
there
are
cases
in
which
if
you
knew
all
you
would
connive
at
terrible
ruin
rather
than
avert
but
stella
we
must
not
let
our
sympathy
with
people
blind
us
there
are
some
actions
that
cut
away
the
roots
of
friendship
i
would
rather
you
had
found
a
way
of
helping
the
poor
woman
without
i
wrote
to
her
regularly
after
i
knew
she
was
living
with
a
horrible
man
who
used
to
lock
himself
up
and
drink
till
he
was
in
delirium
who
was
a
dipsomaniac
before
she
married
him
and
yet
managed
to
conceal
it
from
her
till
after
they
were
married
i
know
she
is
living
a
purer
life
now
than
she
could
then
the
only
child
that
was
born
to
her
was
paralytic
and
imbecile
fortunately
it
died
what
sort
of
a
crime
would
it
have
been
against
herself
and
still
more
against
society
if
she
had
gone
on
adding
to
the
probable
criminals
of
the
its
certain
weaklings
i
know
how
frightfully
hard
life
may
become
but
at
the
worst
no
matter
how
we
may
be
sinned
against
we
may
at
least
refrain
from
joining
the
ranks
of
those
who
have
wronged
meaning
the
criminals
do
you
consider
suicide
a
crime
need
you
ask
dear
because
there
were
two
courses
open
to
kill
herself
or
go
away
with
the
man
who
had
for
over
two
years
protected
her
at
intervals
from
the
maniacal
conduct
of
her
who
was
this
man
an
overseer
on
their
gentleman
by
birth
i
suppose
every
country
evolves
its
own
special
tragedies
you
see
mowbray
s
run
is
four
hundred
miles
north
when
he
came
to
town
now
and
then
before
he
was
married
he
managed
to
keep
sober
at
any
rate
cicely
during
the
five
months
engagement
never
heard
a
breath
or
had
the
least
suspicion
and
if
her
aunt
did
she
took
good
care
not
to
mention
surely
she
would
never
be
guilty
of
such
atrocity
oh
but
she
would
after
the
death
of
the
child
cicely
told
her
all
and
implored
her
to
let
her
stay
in
town
no
a
woman
s
proper
place
was
with
her
husband
that
s
the
sort
of
venomous
old
lynx
she
comfortable
and
decorous
and
going
about
with
a
bottomless
pouch
of
gossip
if
ever
she
comes
to
a
steep
place
she
throws
herself
upon
tradition
and
conventional
morality
to
save
herself
from
the
least
collision
with
stella
dear
that
is
very
severe
said
cuthbert
fondly
stroking
his
sister
s
glowing
cheek
there
was
summer
lightning
in
her
eyes
her
voice
when
she
was
moved
had
a
resistant
silvery
tone
whereas
when
she
was
indifferent
or
merely
amused
she
drawled
a
little
you
wouldn
t
say
so
cuth
if
you
knew
the
old
dame
but
she
was
the
only
relative
cicely
has
in
australia
so
there
was
nothing
for
her
but
to
go
back
two
months
after
she
did
so
i
heard
she
ran
away
with
i
remember
how
dreadfully
cut
up
you
yes
we
are
often
sorriest
for
people
when
the
worst
is
over
now
cuth
don
t
sermonise
i
see
it
is
in
your
eyes
just
look
how
the
hills
are
catching
the
sunset
is
it
so
late
let
me
help
you
up
on
your
beloved
stump
to
see
the
sun
the
stump
feet
in
circumference
relic
of
an
old
monarch
of
the
primæval
woods
was
close
to
the
northern
boundary
wall
of
the
garden
this
point
of
vantage
commanded
varied
and
lovely
views
beyond
north
adelaide
and
its
villaships
looking
to
the
east
and
one
saw
peter
s
college
town
norwood
and
kensington
lying
in
graduated
perspective
and
beyond
these
pretty
prosperous
suburbs
full
of
charming
houses
and
gardens
stretched
the
adelaide
hills
their
bases
and
quiet
darkling
gullies
were
now
in
clear
blue
and
pale
purple
shadows
their
summits
beautifully
flushed
with
the
gold
and
crimson
splendour
of
a
brilliant
sunset
northward
the
wide
fertile
gawler
plain
stretched
beyond
sight
thickly
sprinkled
with
homesteads
and
great
now
ripely
yellowing
for
the
harvest
westward
lay
hindmarsh
and
bowden
the
manufacturing
suburbs
of
the
city

in
the
foreground
with
some
delightfully
houses
their
walls
gleaming
through
and
verandas
beyond
these
might
be
discerned
port
adelaide
with
its
forests
of
lying
along
the
wharves
and
beyond
all
the
ocean
flushed
to
the
verge
of
the
wide
horizon
with
the
setting
sun
for
a
moment
it
rested
like
a
quivering
ball
of
flame
on
the
level
waters
and
then
dropped
out
of
sight
leaving
a
fiery
glow
wide
and
high
in
the
sky
passing
towards
the
zenith
into
the
most
delicate
tones
of
pink
the
same
tints
were
reflected
on
the
hilltops
for
some
time
as
vividly
as
though
they
were
mirrors
throwing
back
a
not
distant
picture
the
two
gazed
on
these
lovely
scenes
with
crowding
associations
that
stretched
back
to
the
first
twilight
of
childish
memories
and
lingered
in
the
garden
till
the
sound
of
the
summoned
them
into
the
house
fairacre
both
within
and
without
bore
the
traces
of
easy
affluence
the
house
was
a
large
building
substantially
built
of
stone
with
a
deep
veranda
furnished
with
venetian
shutters
running
all
round
it
the
principal
rooms
were
large
and
lofty
and
opened
by
wide
doors
half
glass
upon
the
garden
which
from
one
season
to
another
was
never
seen
without
the
radiance
of
many
flowers
the
sparkling
old
silver
and
the
delicately
fine
were
family
heirlooms
as
were
also
several
rare
works
of
art
and
a
large
proportion
of
the
rosewood
furniture
courtland
was
now
close
on
years
of
age
invariably
attired
in
widow
s
weeds
since
her
husband
s
death
years
previously
she
was
descended
from
an
old
highland
family
and
in
face
and
bearing
she
bore
the
unmistakable
stamp
of
refinement
her
features
had
never
been
strictly
beautiful
but
her
countenance
must
always
have
been
marked
by
the
calm
gentleness
the
sweet
kindly
serenity
which
imparted
to
it
so
much
charm
and
distinction
it
must
even
in
youth
have
been
distinguished
by
that
guileless
sincerity
which
formed
an
index
to
a
mind
curiously
free
from
any
taint
of
worldliness
or
the
courtland
family
numbered
eight
in
all
though
there
were
at
this
period
but
four
of
them
under
the
paternal
roof
the
eldest
daughter
barbara
was
married
to
the
rev
joseph
wallerton
an
episcopalian
clergyman
settled
in
sydney
the
second
daughter

raymond
was
a
widow
of
over
two
years
standing
her
husband
had
been
a
wealthy
squatter
in

raymond
and

four
children
chiefly
resided
there
were
two
unmarried
daughters

at

alice
eighteen
months
her
senior
but
looking
incredibly
young
for
her
age
being
and
with
overflowing
which
were
perhaps
providential
as
she
had
recently
entered
on
an
engagement
that
threatened
to
be
rather
indefinite
tom
the
other
son
who
was
at
home
was
a
lawyer
in
good
practice
and
three
years
older
than
the
young
clergyman
the
other
two
brothers
hector
and
claude
the
eldest
and
second
eldest
respectively
had
been
for
over
years
engaged
in
squatting
pursuits
with
almost
unbroken
success
in
the
adjacent
colony
of
victoria
ten
years
previously
a
wealthy
cousin
of
courtland
s
in
the
indian
civil
service
had
left
her
a
legacy
of
thirteen
thousand
pounds
this
had
been
invested
in
lullaboolagana
the
victorian
station
which
not
only
ensured
the
increasing
prosperity
of
the
two
squatters
but
added
handsomely
to
the
general
income
of
the
old
home
the
visitors
at
fairacre
on
this
sunday
afternoon
were
harrison
a
daughter
and
two
sons
it
was
to
felix
the
younger
of
these
and
an
architect
by
calling
that
alice
was
engaged
the
elder
brother
andrew
was
a
journalist
the
support
of
the
rest
of
the
family
depended
largely
on
the
two
young
men
as
the
father
a
clergyman
and
an
old
college
friend
of
the
late
courtland
s

died
a
few
years
previously
leaving
his
widow
with
but
a
small
annuity
and
younger
children
to
be
educated
the
elder
daughter
fanny
was
now
eighteen
and
there
were
growing
symptoms
of
an
attachment
between
herself
and
circumstance
which
drew
the
remark
from
stella
that
it
seemed
as
though
some
families
had
hereditary
tendency
to
catch
infantile
maladies
from
each
other
it
was
when
she
made
observations
of
this
kind
that
tom
used
to
wonder
why
the
youngest
of
an
otherwise
family
should
be
hopelessly
spoiled

afternoon
laurette
tareling
or
to
give
her
the
designation
which
was
dear
to
her
as
a
title
the
hon
talbot
tareling
paid
the
call
of
which
her
brother
had
spoken
on
sunday
she
was
of
the
medium
height
though
something
in
her
face
and
figure
gave
the
impression
that
she
was
small
being
slight
and
fair
with
a
faint
colour
deepened
with
a
little
rouge
so
skilfully
that
it
was
unsuspected
by
all
save
the
most
practised
eyes
she
had
fair
fluffy
hair
lightened
by
gold
dust
descending
in
a
fringe
of
infantile
curliness
to
within
a
short
distance
of
her
eyes
which
were
dark
brown
rather
small
but
very
bright
and
keen
and
altogether
somewhat
like
those
of
a
parrot
that
is
bent
on
finding
out
a
great
deal
an
expression
that
was
further
carried
out
by
the
nose
which
took
the
liberty
of
turning
up
a
little
and
a
mouth
which
though
it
smiled
very
often
had
something
rather
hard
and
beakish
in
its
formation
yet
on
the
whole
tareling
was
considered
pretty
she
dressed
extremely
well
and
was
never
seen
beyond
the
domestic
circle
without
an
air
of
determined
vivacity
she
had
the
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
smartest
talkers
in
melbourne
society
and
had
a
knack
of
telling
a
story
against
those
to
whom
she
owed
any
grudge
which
at
once
made
her
popular
and
created
many
enemies
courtland
and
her
two
daughters
were
in
the
when
the
visitor
was
shown
in
tareling
bestowed
sharp
little
explosive
kisses
on
each
ending
with
stella
at
whom
she
looked
inquiringly
her
head
a
little
to
one
side
why
stella
you
have
grown
thinner
she
said
half
pensively
my
dear
courtland
has
stella
been
ill
oh
no
stella
is
never
ill
answered
the
mother
with
a
fond
smile
well
just
look
at
the
to
see
them
would
think
allie
was
older
ah
laurette
you
are
letting
me
down
gently
said
stella
trying
to
keep
back
the
mischievous
smile
that
lurked
round
her
lips
what
you
mean
is
that
i
am
going
off
my
first
youth
is
oh
well
in
a
climate
like
ours
we
must
make
up
our
mind
that
we
shed
our
first
youth
when
we
leave
our
fortunate
people
like
allie
who
discover
some
which
they
don
t
give
even
their
sisters
laughed
stella
well
larry
i
promise
you
if
ever
i
get
the
chance
i
shall
have
a
only
to
save
you
oh
as
for
that
who
is
such
a
wreck
as
i
am
myself
for
my
age
i
assure
you
the
day
before
i
left
melbourne
i
nearly
wept
at
finding
that
i
was
suddenly
an
old
hag
oh
positively
in
the
morning
i
found
two
gray
hairs
in
my
comb
i
always
heard
people
speak
of
the
first
gray
hair
but
there
were
two
showing
that
somewhere
my
head
was
getting
powdered
with
the
frost
of
age
and
that
wasn
t
all
in
the
afternoon
i
stood
in
a
cross
light
opposite
a
mirror
i
turned
round
with
a
start
who
is
that
creature
thought
i
with
her
cheeks
so
hollow
and
a
faded
colour
and
lines
deepening
round
her
mouth
and
then
to
crown
it
all
talbot
came
in
that
moment
leading
gwendolen
by
the
hand
looking
atrociously
tall
for
her
four
is
that
your
little
daughter
laurette
asked
courtland
who
was
getting
a
little
hard
of
hearing
and
did
not
quite
catch
the
drift
of
these
remarks
which
were
delivered
in
a
rapid
tone
levelled
especially
at
stella
yes
dear
courtland
and
growing
such
a
big
girl
and
so
precocious
she
wanted
to
know
the
other
day
whether
her
little
brother
howard
would
not
be
lord
lillimore
when
he
grew
up
and
then
she
was
sure
she
said
that
uncle
ted
would
be
sir
edward
my
dear
you
must
not
let
her
be
too
much
with
the
servants
you
should
get
a
nice
young
lady
as
for
her
said
courtland
in
a
motherly
way
never
dreaming
that
this
precocious
tattle
had
been
invented
by
laurette
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
well
life
is
full
of
accidents
who
knows
but
both
these
events
may
come
off
one
day
said
alice
solemnly
though
there
was
a
merry
gleam
in
her
eyes
and
then
tareling
went
off
on
another
tack
you
are
always
so
beautifully
quiet
and
sedate
in
adelaide
it
is
really
like
coming
to
another
world
from
melbourne
and
the
season
was
so
late
with
us
this
year
what
with
the
russian
and
german
and
the
visit
of
the
sultan
of
morocco
it
was
a
perfect
whirlpool
i
felt
at
last
i
would
like
to
retire
to
the
grande
but
i
suppose
you
find
the
dear
little
farinaceous
village
almost
as
quiet
hardly
anything
happens
with
us
said
alice
people
die
occasionally
but
only
once
and
very
seldom
yes
and
holes
come
occasionally
in
the
the
poorer
classes
you
know
and
alice
glanced
half
ruefully
at
the
brussels
pile
which
had
been
in
the
for
twenty
years
and
began
to
show
signs
of
wear
in
places
yes
and
even
your
governors
last
longer
than
they
do
elsewhere
answered
tareling
now
with
us
in
seven
years
we
have
had
two
and
next
month
sir
marmaduke
leaves
and
who
do
you
think
is
his
successor
why
lord
weavelow
whose
wife
is
talbot
s
first
cousin
and
lord
weavelow
a
connection
of
his
lady
gertrude
it
is
rather
trying
to
be
so
closely
related
to
the
new
governor
in
our
oh
my
dear
it
is
very
likely
they
will
be
quite
nice
people
i
dare
say
you
will
like
them
very
well
said
courtland
soothingly
which
amused
her
daughters
not
a
little
mother
never
did
and
never
will
comprehend
the
little
subtleties
of
a
snob
as
alice
said
afterwards
half
despairingly
oh
i
dare
say
we
shall
like
them
very
much
but
then
we
are
so
and
the
people
who
entertain
most
in
melbourne
get
more
ostentatious
every
theatres
and
enormous
and
french
cooks
who
keep
a
tandem
and
a
cremona
fancy
all
these
complexities
off
the
back
of
the
idyllic
sheep
said
stella
laughing
well
laurette
if
i
were
you
i
would
go
in
for
a
sweet
and
severe
simplicity
it
would
really
be
more
that
is
true
but
nothing
is
so
costly
as
the
only
form
of
simplicity
open
to
you
if
you
have
the
right
of
tambour
at
government
house
returned
tareling
with
the
air
of
one
who
is
laying
down
axioms
for
the
guidance
of
society
from
olympian
social
heights
at
this
moment
a
little
diversion
was
caused
by
the
entrance
of
two
elderly
quaker
ladies
maiden
sisters
in
soft
dresses
and
bonnets
and
white
fichus
of
indian
muslin
they
were
followed
by
afternoon
tea
over
which
the
older
ladies
fell
into
a
group
to
themselves
talking
softly
over
sick
and
afflicted
people
and
new
candidates
for
admission
to
the
asylum
for
incurables
still
i
suppose
you
will
hardly
retire
to
the
wilds
of
kannawijera
when
your
relatives
begin
to
reign
at
government
house
said
alice
taking
up
the
thread
of
conversation
as
she
presided
at
the
no
not
this
coming
season
at
any
rate
we
had
to
give
up
our
house
at
yarra
yarra
they
raised
the
rent
so
atrociously
but
we
have
secured
a
smaller
one
at
toorak
with
the
principal
rooms
almost
all
the
partitions
in
that
can
be
pushed
back
in
the
most
wonderful
way
just
like
one
of
those
least
they
look
like
knives
but
when
you
open
the
handle
it
turns
into
corkscrews
and
toothpicks
and
besides
several
blades
everyone
says
melbourne
will
be
awfully
full
by
may
so
we
caught
time
by
the
forelock
and
took
this
house
from
november
but
we
don
t
pay
a
penny
more
than
if
we
waited
later
it
is
to
be
a
most
brilliant
season
everyone
says
and
now
stella
i
want
to
arrange
about
your
oh
you
are
very
kind
said
stella
don
t
say
that
it
s
a
bad
omen
always
before
when
i
asked
you
to
come
you
said
you
are
very
kind
and
didn
t
turn
up
it
s
no
use
coming
for
a
couple
of
weeks
like
the
girls
who
come
from
the
wilds
of
the
bush
for
a
birthday
ball
and
don
t
know
a
soul
but
a
few
lanky
men
in
split
gloves
who
don
t
waltz
and
huddle
up
together
behind
the
ah
laurette
you
had
better
think
twice
before
you
are
burdened
through
part
of
a
brilliant
season
with
a
country
cousin
like
me
said
stella
laughing
merrily
at
the
picture
called
up
by
laurette
i
suppose
it
would
be
no
use
asking
you
to
come
as
well
allie
just
for
a
couple
of
weeks
said
tareling
graciously
allie
raised
her
hands
in
mock
despair
how
can
you
ask
i
am
in
training
to
keep
a
house
on
nine
or
ten
pounds
a
week
and
save
out
of
that
for
a
rainy
oh
how
very
romantic
but
surely
no
rainier
day
can
come
than
nine
or
ten
pounds
a
week
said
tareling
with
wonder
you
see
larry
you
who
are
on
over
three
thousand
a
year
can
hardly
plumb
the
depths
of
real
destitution
said
alice
there
is
the
poverty
of
hot
joints
and
frugal
days
of
interlinear
allie
whatever
you
do
when
you
and
felix
marry
do
not
have
large
joints
said
stella
gravely
i
am
confident
that
the
happiness
of
the
australian
household
is
more
frequently
wrecked
by
hash
than
any
ethical
well
i
am
studying
the
question
perhaps
i
may
one
day
publish
a
shilling
for
young
couples
who
ought
not
to
have
surely
felix
s
income
must
be
considerable
now
they
say
he
is
the
best
architect
in
the
place
said
laurette
somewhat
abruptly
this
laughing
raillery
about
poverty
did
not
commend
itself
to
her
in
the
least
it
is
mortifying
when
one
wants
to
make
a
girl
feel
how
comparatively
humble
her
prospects
are
to
find
her
treating
the
subject
in
a
vein
but
then
there
are
the
younger
children
to
provide
dependent
on
felix
and
andrew
returned
alice
well
it
s
a
pity
you
girls
couldn
t
go
in
for
a
little
division
of
poverty
replied
laurette
here
is
stella
s
rolling
in
as
it
happens
that
young
woman
hasn
t
got
a
returned
stella
quickly
no
you
and
ted
keep
on
such
good
terms
i
always
forget
the
affair
was
broken
off
said
laurette
rather
maliciously
but
now
for
your
visit
i
must
talk
it
over
with
mother
before
making
ultimate
but
we
all
know
beforehand
what
that
means
your
mother
says
yes
darling
to
all
you
propose
pray
my
dear
don
t
forget
that
i
ve
known
you
from
childhood
it
was
never
a
secret
you
were
rather
thus
pressed
stella
said
half
hesitatingly
well
if
you
let
me
come
to
you
on
my
way
to
lullaboolagana
without
pledging
myself
to
the
length
of
the
visit
but
do
you
know
that
dustiefoot
insists
on
coming
wherever
i
go
oh
yes
and
you
always
take
maisie
when
you
pay
a
long
least
someone
said
so
the
other
yes
put
in
alice
we
spare
maisie
to
stella
because
she
could
never
bear
to
brush
her
dresses
or
sew
on
bits
of
braid
it
is
a
case
of
atavism
she
has
reverted
to
the
only
duchess
that
was
in
our
than
three
centuries
that
is
curious
said
stella
maintaining
the
mock
gravity
with
which
her
sister
spoke
for
after
twelve
generations
the
proportion
of
blood
of
any
one
ancestor
in
only
in
at
any
rate
it
is
settled
you
are
to
maisie
and
all
said
laurette
by
the
way
how
did
you
enjoy
the
emberly
ball
oh
immensely
answered
stella
and
then
a
quick
wave
of
colour
suffused
her
face
mounting
even
to
her
forehead
we
enjoyed
it
not
wisely
but
too
well
we
fancy
there
has
been
no
nice
weather
since
that
ball
was
over
said
alice
who
sympathetically
noted
this
uncompromising
blush
and
tried
to
attract
laurette
s
gleaming
eyes
from
her
sister
s
face
but
laurette
had
in
an
eminent
degree
what
talleyrand
considered
the
whole
art
of
is
the
art
of
any
rate
what
was
on
the
surface
oh
very
much
did
you
and
you
used
to
be
so
disdainful
of
dancing
but
to
be
sure
that
was
when
you
were
much
younger
and
those
alcoves
one
heard
so
much
they
a
great
success
i
declare
stella
there
must
be
something
behind
this
do
you
know
you
are
blushing
most
furiously
oh
i
always
blush
when
i
ask
alice
for
a
second
cup
of
tea
replied
stella
recovering
her
as
for
the
half
was
not
told
you
there
are
eight
windows
in
the
and
round
each
window
an
alcove
much
larger
than
an
ordinary
all
lined
with
satin
with
a
seat
running
round
each
up
the
front
on
both
sides
brackets
with
great
vases
full
of
ferns
and
roses
and
lotos
blooms
and
asphodel
overhead
an
electric
light
in
an
opal
globe
exactly
like
a
great
piece
of
the
full
moon
put
into
a
crystal
prison
only
more
and
don
t
forget
the
cream
lace
curtains
in
front
lined
with
salmon
satin
stella
said
alice
looking
at
her
sister
with
a
dancing
light
in
her
eyes
and
then
turning
to
laurette
the
thing
was
to
meet
prince
charming
at
the
and
chat
with
him
and
then
sit
out
the
rest
of
the
evening
in
an
alcove
behind
the
curtains
and
two
chaperons
just
fashioned
by
providence
so
as
to
completely
screen
you
from
the
other
men
to
whom
you
might
have
promised
indeed
and
was
your
chaperon
said
laurette
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
sisters
stella
had
grown
suddenly
grave
though
the
remnants
of
her
furious
blushing
still
lingered
in
her
cheeks
oh
marwood
and
tom
and
felix
and
andrew
answered
alice
lightly
and
which
of
you
retired
into
the
alcove
with
the
imprisoned
moonlight
and
prince
charming
how
literal
you
are
my
dear
said
alice
laughing
but
you
see
after
one
s
ideals
of
life
have
been
exalted
by
such
alcoves
you
must
not
expect
stella
to
fall
quite
prostrate
before
the
grandeurs
of
melbourne
laurette
seemed
only
half
satisfied
with
this
explanation
but
feeling
that
further
investigation
would
be
useless
just
then
she
allowed
the
subject
to
drop
i
wonder
what
has
given
laurette
this
ardent
attack
of
friendship
just
now
said
stella
when
the
sisters
were
alone
about
insisting
on
your
visit
oh
she
means
to
show
you
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
and
the
glory
thereof
and
i
expect
it
s
not
so
much
laurette
as
ted
it
s
a
change
of
venue
so
as
to
get
a
different
verdict
you
have
got
into
the
habit
of
saying
no
at
fairacre
but
in
that
smaller
house
at
toorak
surrounded
by
magnates
who
have
private
theatres
and
french
all
laurette
is
very
oh
yes
for
a
day
or
two
but
get
a
little
below
the
surface
and
she
always
has
the
hard
crude
touch
of
the
social
amateur
and
could
you
be
such
a
little
jackdaw
as
to
say
that
to
prince
charming
well
it
was
partly
my
instincts
as
an
artist
i
could
not
bear
to
hear
you
give
the
light
graphic
touches
of
the
setting
and
leave
out
the
very
core
besides
even
laurette
can
not
unravel
that
little
mystery
do
you
know
stella
it
s
the
nearest
thing
to
a
romance
that
has
happened
one
year
a
great
brilliant
wonderful
austrian
lights
introduction
without
sympathy
between
two
long
talk
behind
ferns
and
chaperons
in
an
thrown
to
the
the
fugitives
are
discovered
by
an
irate
lover
who
is
down
for
two
without
even
a
lingering
of
the
prince
before
trace
even
the
people
who
got
him
the
invitation
depart
next
day
by
the
and
steamer
ah
me
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
princess
of
to
awaken
the
sleeping
beauty
with
a
kiss
would
i
were
the
sleeping
beauty
he
really
had
a
distinguished
i
wish
felix
would
overhear
you
said
stella
who
listened
to
this
little
rhapsody
with
a
smile
ah
my
dear
when
people
are
so
desperately
fond
of
each
other
as
felix
and
i
the
shadow
of
romance
never
eclipses
their
gaiety
but
the
more
i
have
thought
over
the
episode
the
more
does
it
appear
to
me
in
the
light
of
an
allegory
you
were
from
childhood
the
victim
of
the
ideal
you
always
forsook
your
dolls
when
you
perceived
they
were
stuffed
with
sawdust
when
you
found
the
kitten
of
commerce
mewed
by
means
of
a
spring
you
would
have
no
more
of
it
and
so
in
the
central
fact
of
a
woman
s
life
as
someone
has
called
marriage
you
ask
for
better
bread
than
is
made
from
wheat
well
just
for
one
evening
you
saw
one
cast
in
that
higher
mould
and
then
you
were
for
ever
secured
from
allie
you
have
got
into
one
of
your
random
fits
remember
it
is
you
who
have
been
spending
yourself
on
theories
and
imaginings
concerning
the
ah
my
dear
it
is
what
you
do
not
say
that
i
try
to
interpret
but
take
it
i
say
as
an
a
real
event
and
then
turn
your
mind
to
the
sober
realities
of
life
now
confess
if
at
the
end
of
october
you
had
not
gone
to
a
certain
assembly
in
november
you
would
have
fulfilled
your
engagement
and
gone
to
the
melbourne
cup
and
made
certain
them
rather
remember
our
conversation
two
days
before
the
ball
when
our
dresses
came
i
like
your
way
of
measuring
life
by
the
dressmaker
s
thread
well
it
s
much
more
cheerful
than
that
of
the
paræ
but
you
do
remember
that
conversation
yes
i
think
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
some
people
married
because
they
were
in
love
others
because
they
thought
they
were
but
the
majority
because
they
couldn
t
and
that
you
belonged
to
the
last
named
but
would
very
likely
find
the
unholy
estate
of
matrimony
as
brilliant
an
affair
as
most
well
for
goodness
sake
don
t
let
us
go
on
quoting
ourselves
as
if
we
were
classics
in
russia
backs
i
still
hold
to
that
i
begin
to
see
that
ted
is
my
fate
i
shall
have
to
succumb
on
the
whole
it
will
be
less
tiresome
and
then
i
want
to
go
to
rome
and
you
might
have
gone
with
claude
and
well
it
was
heroic
of
them
to
offer
to
take
me
but
i
think
it
would
have
been
still
more
heroic
of
me
to
have
gone
oh
every
there
be
anything
in
life
more
unendurable
than
the
confident
air
of
prosperity
which
envelops
your
couple
the
melting
stolen
glances
the
becoming
humility
the
timid
anxiety
to
please
that
in
days
marked
their
demeanour
disappear
as
if
some
witch
had
exorcised
them
with
black
oh
let
it
be
white
magic
stella
if
only
for
my
sake
till
at
last
we
have
that
placid
of
each
other
s
presence
which
decks
your
married
pair
as
a
cankerworm
adorns
the
oh
stella
stella
i
believe
you
really
were
born
with
a
mistrust
of
marriage
laughed
the
elder
sister
yes
ever
since
i
have
been
able
to
think
or
observe
i
have
been
convinced
that
marriage
is
the
most
foolish
faulty
old
institution
alice
at
this
laughed
louder
than
before
and
then
still
smiling
with
the
joyous
confident
smile
of
a
woman
triumphantly
in
love
she
said
i
wish
dear
you
would
throw
out
a
few
hints
for
the
improvement
of
this
well
you
see
really
to
improve
it
would
be
to
destroy
it
to
begin
with
people
see
too
much
of
each
other
which
seems
to
be
destructive
alike
to
passion
and
good
manners
oh
yes
you
are
ready
to
à
at
all
this
nevertheless
fate
and
the
comedians
are
lying
in
wait
for
as
for
the
comedians
i
care
nothing
for
them
most
of
them
were
men
who
married
dreadful
even
molière
did
and
the
most
terrible
sting
it
can
have
is
that
after
living
all
our
lives
together
felix
and
i
may
not
die
like
the
babes
in
the
wood
or
philemon
and
yes
or
those
dear
old
people
one
so
often
sees
in
common
life
who
survive
each
other
only
a
few
quiet
uncomplaining
weeks
or
months
but
as
for
you
i
suppose
you
would
have
your
husband
come
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
asking
in
an
agitated
voice
when
he
might
pay
you
a
morning
call
yes
and
then
i
would
look
at
my
ivory
pretty
one
you
gave
me
a
year
ago
with
a
tablet
for
each
day
in
the
i
would
say
is
goethe
s
birthday
and
i
see
only
people
who
write
sonnets
in
honour
of
that
occasion
ah
but
yours
my
friend
do
not
scan
no
nothing
in
prose
however
felicitous
will
pass
muster
well
the
next
t
you
let
him
come
on
the
next
day
pleaded
alice
a
wicked
light
gleaming
in
her
eyes
no
the
next
day
i
have
an
appointment
with
a
white
fairy
it
has
four
hundred
and
fifty
buds
and
some
of
them
have
promised
to
open
on
that
day
well
yes
perhaps
wednesday
but
mind
you
must
be
very
amusing
and
whatever
you
do
don
t
tell
me
old
stories
and
so
grave
and
gay
by
turns
they
talked
of
love
and
marriage
as
girls
are
wont
to
do
in
the
sheltered
sanctuary
of
the
parental
home
while
life
is
a
sort
of
isthmus
between
early
youth
and
the
deeper
responsibilities
of
womanhood
behind
them
lies
childhood
full
of
sunshine
and
laughter
of
bird
calls
and
opening
roses
and
passionate
little
griefs
that
passed
into
oblivion
in
the
sleep
that
came
with
the
glimmering
twilight
yes
looking
backward
there
lie
the
fairest
meadows
sunny
nooks
made
cosier
with
the
blue
haze
of
smoke
rising
from
familiar
hearths
and
always
in
the
air
the
refrain
of
cradle
songs
the
sound
of
bells
calling
to
prayer
the
faces
and
voices
that
they
first
loved
that
they
must
love
to
the
end
they
are
still
merely
onlookers
seeing
but
selected
replicas
of
the
play
of
life
jealously
guarded
from
the
vulgar
collisions
of
the
crowd
but
what
is
there
on
the
farther
side
of
the
isthmus
it
is
far
off
and
the
land
is
veiled
in
mist
but
there
are
arenas
there
in
which
terrible
things
happen
there
is
reckless
trampling
as
of
wild
beasts
and
there
are
dark
stains
of
bloodshed
quickly
sanded
over
often
there
come
rumours
of
those
overtaken
with
worse
than
the
throes
of
dissolution
the
shadow
of
the
valley
of
life
is
much
more
intolerable
oftentimes
than
that
of
death
there
are
whirlpools
that
suck
in
more
than
life
and
those
who
have
been
so
delicately
guarded
will
their
path
trend
towards
sinister
pitfalls
will
they
be
overtaken
by
those
catastrophes
that
mutilate
human
lives
smitten
with
those
fiery
darts
that
with
a
touch
work
moral
paralysis
how
will
it
be
with
them
in
the
unborn
years
far
from
the
old
sacred
shelter
of
their
early
home
will
they
moan
for
help
in
the
darkness
with
no
ear
to
listen
to
their
cry
ah
dear
god
how
strange
and
pitiful
it
all
incredible
saga
of
human
life
whose
beginning
we
have
lost
whose
end
we
can
not
tell
in
which
we
lose
one
by
one
those
who
are
our
companions
and
in
the
end
lose
ourselves
in
which
we
are
first
robbed
of
all
we
love
and
then
of
all
we
know
the
sisters
had
wandered
from
lighter
topics
and
were
talking
in
hushed
tones
of
their
father
s
death
when
edward
ritchie
was
announced
and
the
young
man
entered
with
that
air
so
characteristic
of
him
of
being
in
and
belonging
wholly
to
a
world
without
visions
or
anxious
forecasts
his
mere
presence
threw
discredit
on
the
sophistry
of
speculation
he
was
to
use
an
old
figure
of
speech
for
ever
planting
cabbages
and
when
one
foot
was
on
the
ground
the
other
was
not
far
off
nothing
in
books
or
the
destiny
of
the
race
or
the
life
of
the
soul
had
ever
moved
him
but
then
he
was
never
without
a
horse
or
two
that
had
achieved
something
wonderful
or
were
just
going
to
do
so
or
might
do
it
if
they
chose
without
being
exactly
excited
over
this
he
was
so
deeply
interested
and
so
sure
people
wanted
to
know
all
about
it
that
he
often
even
in
the
breasts
of
those
who
cared
little
for
equine
performances
created
a
glow
of
enthusiasm
which
banished
every
subject
of
a
less
abstract
nature
than
an
animal
of
good
lineage
with
four
legs
and
a
mane
there
was
spindrift
now
who
could
do
anything
he
liked
at
home
and
yet
put
him
on
a
you
would
swear
he
was
dickey
on
every
leg
he
had
got
and
had
sprung
a
hock
into
the
bargain
it
was
enough
to
make
a
fellow
eat
his
hat
and
the
horse
too
and
such
a
beautiful
perfect
in
all
his
the
shoulders
were
not
quite
oblique
enough
but
the
only
thing
by
which
you
could
guess
there
was
a
bad
nick
in
him
was
his
eye
never
trust
a
horse
unless
his
eye
is
bold
and
full
etc
ted
s
ostensible
mission
on
this
occasion
was
to
invite
the
courtlands
to
a
at
his
father
s
house
before
cuthbert
left
for
melbourne
my
mother
and
i
put
our
heads
together
and
planned
it
after
larry
came
to
see
you
he
explained
when
larry
comes
on
a
visit
to
the
old
house
now
she
wants
to
drive
everyone
tandem
full
swing
but
we
just
gave
her
the
slip
and
settled
how
many
and
all
and
i
wouldn
t
even
wait
till
shall
be
here
at
ten
sharp
to
take
you
out
riding
you
know
stella
i
thought
perhaps
cuth
might
have
some
parsonic
concern
on
if
he
didn
t
get
early
but
a
on
the
december
said
stella
in
a
voice
of
consternation
everyone
will
be
so
frightfully
used
up
with
the
tradespeople
s
christmas
cards
and
the
heat
and
the
athanasian
creed
the
day
before
but
ted
overruled
every
objection
he
had
to
return
to
strathhaye
soon
after
christmas
and
the
was
the
only
day
and
come
they
must
then
the
three
went
out
into
the
garden
to
see
the
sun
set
across
the
sea
which
was
one
of
the
traditions
at
fairacre
all
over
the
west
the
heavens
seemed
on
fire
and
underneath
lay
the
sea
wide
and
silvery
and
calm
as
a
great
inland
lake
a
craft
going
southward
stood
out
with
startling
distinctness
where
lies
the
land
to
which
yon
ship
must
go
said
stella
watching
its
course
with
a
far
look
in
her
eyes
to
normanton
i
expect
for
potatoes
said
ted
promptly
and
then
when
his
companions
laughed
involuntarily
at
this
explanation
he
asked
very
placidly
where
the
joke
came
in
well
ted
you
must
know
that
a
man
called
wordsworth
wrote
sonnets
and
that
is
a
line
out
of
one
of
them
said
alice
i
m
blessed
if
ever
i
could
make
out
why
these
old
buffers
of
poets
want
to
jaw
so
much
about
things
if
he
didn
t
know
where
the
boat
was
going
why
didn
t
he
ask
at
a
shipping
office
instead
of
writing
a
sonnet
this
reflection
delivered
in
a
wondering
tone
made
stella
laugh
more
than
before
though
ted
could
not
always
very
well
divine
the
cause
of
her
clear
rippling
laughter
no
sound
was
pleasanter
to
his
ears
the
elder
sister
watched
the
two
with
an
amused
interest
that
was
always
renewed
it
was
apparent
that
the
blunt
shrewd
way
in
which
the
young
man
so
forcibly
used
his
limited
outlook
on
life
formed
a
kind
of
attraction
to
the
girl
who
had
that
wide
sympathetic
range
of
view
which
a
culture
imparts
who
was
infected
too
by
that
dreamy
sceptical
attitude
of
mind
born
of
a
nature
innately
introspective
and
early
inured
to
flights
in
mental
dialectics
i
suppose
i
ought
to
go
now
said
ted
lingeringly
no
stay
to
dinner
and
spend
the
evening
with
us
said
alice
oh
it
doesn
t
matter
about
your
clothes
tom
and
cuth
seldom
dress
when
we
dine
in
the
will
you
play
with
me
for
sixpenny
points
if
i
stay
stella
oh
i
must
play
for
ted
coloured
with
pleasure
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
and
stella
hastened
to
explain
you
see
it
is
near
the
end
of
the
quarter
and
i
have
nothing
in
my
purse
but
a
doubtful
and
a
damaged
iv
godolphin
house
the
town
residence
of
sir
edward
ritchie
was
a
large
pile
of
buildings
near
the
foot
of
the
hills
a
few
miles
to
the
of
adelaide
everything
was
on
a
large
house
the
grounds
the
conservatories
the
trees
and
even
the
views
the
place
had
been
well
planned
and
built
from
the
neat
little
lodge
at
the
chief
entrance
to
the
handsome
stables
with
their
luxurious
appointments
at
some
distance
to
the
rear
of
the
house
and
the
house
itself
lacked
no
comfort
or
convenience
of
modern
days
and
to
a
certain
extent
had
been
even
pleasant
to
the
eye
till
in
an
evil
hour
the
emissary
of
a
great
decorative
firm
had
prevailed
on
sir
edward
to
have
the
mansion
done
up
from
top
to
toe
this
took
the
form
of
a
carnival
of
unlimited
expenditure
and
that
unhappy
outburst
of
british
philistinism
known
as
the
æsthetic
craze
there
was
one
apartment
known
as
the
which
upset
an
old
bush
comrade
of
sir
edward
s
in
a
surprising
way
the
man
was
one
to
whom
money
had
no
value
apart
from
the
excitement
of
earning
and
losing
it
his
life
was
impartially
spent
in
tents
in
the
wilderness
and
costly
hotels
he
and
sir
edward
had
worked
together
as
wood
sawyers
in
a
great
for
over
seven
years
this
long
period
of
hard
lucrative
work
had
laid
the
foundation
of
the
worthy
knight
s
large
fortune
while
for
the
other
man
it
started
the
habit
of
alternately
drinking
bad
champagne
at
a
guinea
a
bottle
out
of
a
quart
jug
and
humping
his
swag
to
the
last
new
rush
for
it
was
always
gold
that
attracted
him
and
that
with
astonishing
frequency
retrieved
his
fallen
fortunes
but
through
all
the
reverses
of
the
one
and
the
climbing
grandeurs
of
the
other
the
friendship
between
the
two
men
was
unbroken
it
was
when
godolphin
house
was
at
its
most
appalling
stage
of
unmodified
portières
to
nymphs
with
exaggerated
chins
holding
bronze
lamps
the
bushman
paid
one
of
his
periodical
visits
sir
edward
took
him
all
over
the
house
and
finally
the
two
sat
down
in
the
here
they
dug
their
and
felled
mighty
giants
of
the
forest
over
again
but
the
more
adventurous
spirit
had
recently
knocked
down
a
large
nugget
and
his
nerves
were
not
what
they
ought
to
be
ned
my
boy
i
can
t
stand
these
blazing
eyes
any
longer
they
get
upon
my
liver
somehow
i
ll
take
a
turn
in
the
fresh
with
that
he
stepped
on
the
terrace
but
the
next
moment
he
rushed
back
white
and
breathless
look
here
old
man
i
must
hook
it
out
of
this
why
you
ve
hung
the
very
birds
with
these
damned
staring
eyes
he
had
come
upon
a
row
of
peacocks
sunning
their
gorgeous
tails
on
the
terrace
on
which
he
had
taken
refuge
even
ted
used
to
grumble
that
it
was
all
very
well
to
lick
the
place
into
a
cocked
hat
with
screens
and
fans
and
dados
and
but
it
was
a
jolly
shame
not
to
leave
a
den
or
two
in
which
a
fellow
could
live
laurette
adored
all
the
transformations
as
long
as
they
were
quite
the
thing
but
when
the
tide
turned
she
wrought
various
changes
from
time
to
time
during
her
visits
to
her
parents
and
in
several
rooms
had
quite
wiped
away
the
disgrace
of
conventional
æstheticism
but
the
air
of
no
expenses
spared
and
of
being
with
a
rampant
who
has
forsworn
the
old
honest
british
hideousness
for
a
sickly
unreality
was
apt
to
weigh
heavy
on
the
spirits
it
was
a
house
in
which
above
all
others
to
taste
the
wormwood
of
ennui
to
its
last
dregs
in
which
to
be
overcome
by
that
lassitude
of
body
and
bitter
languor
of
mind
in
which
these
symptoms
may
be
successively
noted
you
have
a
growing
conviction
that
you
can
draw
your
breath
but
an
hour
longer
without
a
change
of
environment
you
find
yourself
yawning
irretrievably
when
you
essay
to
add
your
mite
to
feeble
anecdotes
of
the
weather
you
find
your
face
turning
to
stone
when
you
strive
with
all
the
anguish
of
despair
to
call
up
a
smile
in
response
to
a
faded
joke
you
reply
with
withering
platitudes
to
every
observation
and
you
find
the
kindliest
attempt
at
pleasantry
an
unpardonable
offence
you
sit
on
and
on
with
the
uncommunicating
muteness
of
a
fish
till
you
are
overpowered
by
the
thought
that
if
you
do
not
creep
into
the
solitude
of
your
own
room
you
will
be
driven
to
commit
some
desperate
deed
so
that
you
may
be
imprisoned
or
sent
to
an
asylum
for
the
insane
or
some
equally
genial
retreat
that
will
mercifully
shield
you
from
the
joys
of
social
intercourse
but
the
culmination
of
all
was
the
library
it
was
a
marvel
in
its
way
horace
walpole
somewhere
speaks
of
one
that
contained
only
a
broken
chair
a
chart
and
a
lame
telescope
but
this
was
an
enchanting
bower
for
the
muses
compared
to
a
room
full
of
lame
and
impotent
compilations
in
books
thinglets
fit
only
to
wrap
candles
in
or
make
in
lent
for
pilchards
or
keep
butter
in
the
from
melting
there
were
rows
upon
rows
of
such
stuff
as
the
rev
ebenezer
slipslop
on
corinthians
awful
encyclopedias
and
treasuries
of
knowledge
and
biographies
of
men
who
to
the
prime
sin
of
having
existed
at
all
added
the
no
less
unpardonable
one
of
swelling
the
dreariest
form
of
fiction
so
many
and
so
many
and
such
woe
in
proportion
to
the
keen
pleasure
we
associate
with
real
books
is
the
gloom
which
the
bare
sight
of
such
can
induce
the
tradition
ran
that
sir
edward
had
ordered
a
ton
of
books
from
a
bookseller
in
distress
and
that
this
enterprising
tradesman
had
bought
up
and
bound
for
the
godolphin
house
library
an
astounding
collection
of
the
young
men
s
mutual
improvement
type
of
rubbish
there
was
probably
not
a
fact
in
the
known
world
of
the
callow
sort
one
hears
only
to
forget
which
did
not
repose
on
these
shelves
even
in
venturing
out
in
the
grounds
at
godolphin
house
everything
still
breathed
of
money
recklessly
lavished
by
hirelings
one
was
constantly
taken
to
gaze
at
some
double
or
triple
monstrosity
perpetrated
by
gardeners
who
were
so
highly
paid
that
it
would
compromise
them
to
let
nature
have
much
of
her
own
way
when
ted
returned
to
his
father
s
house
that
night
he
found
as
he
usually
called
a
bitterly
discontented
frame
of
mind
who
do
you
think
has
come
to
stay
for
two
weeks
ted
she
cried
the
moment
she
caught
sight
of
him
tareling
questioned
ted
carelessly
taking
possession
of
one
armchair
and
resting
his
feet
on
another
oh
you
know
very
well
he
wouldn
t
come
to
stay
so
long
especially
at
it
is
uncle
john
well
i
m
glad
the
old
chap
came
while
i
m
here
it
s
ages
since
i
saw
him
did
he
bring
aunt
along
with
him
upon
my
word
ted
you
are
horribly
provoking
sometimes
you
take
it
as
coolly
as
if
he
were
the
most
agreeable
company
in
the
well
one
s
relations
aren
t
often
that
but
still
there
they
are
you
know
and
there
they
were
before
we
showed
our
noses
in
the
world
has
the
old
man
gone
to
bed
yes
long
ago
that
s
his
way
he
ll
go
to
bed
when
the
hens
do
that
he
may
rise
at
daybreak
to
go
creaking
all
over
the
house
and
burst
into
guffaws
of
laughter
at
the
decorations
and
things
and
tell
abominable
stories
before
the
now
draw
it
mild
larry
the
old
fellow
can
tell
a
shady
yarn
as
well
as
most
men
of
his
age
especially
if
he
s
a
bit
sprung
but
he
doesn
t
before
the
servants
and
i
m
sure
he
wouldn
t
before
oh
i
don
t
mean
what
you
call
shady
yarns
it
s
much
worse
when
he
tells
how
he
left
london
as
a
stowaway
with
two
and
threepence
in
his
pockets
and
not
a
second
shirt
to
his
yes
he
had
don
t
you
remember
the
little
bundle
done
up
in
a
red
cotton
pair
of
breeches
and
a
crimea
shirt
goodness
knows
i
ought
to
remember
it
all
i
ve
heard
it
often
well
it
s
natural
when
a
man
comes
to
be
he
should
like
to
tell
how
he
kicked
up
his
heels
at
seventeen
if
a
horse
has
got
much
gumption
he
doesn
t
care
to
race
after
he
s
two
years
old
but
a
man
goes
it
as
long
as
he
can
and
afterwards
he
likes
to
speak
of
the
old
days
and
by
jove
it
s
only
what
you
might
expect
added
ted
reflectively
i
d
sooner
be
a
stowaway
without
even
a
bundle
than
be
close
on
seventy
with
a
million
of
ah
yes
but
if
you
became
a
stowaway
it
would
be
a
very
different
tale
you
ve
been
brought
up
with
the
command
of
money
and
servants
and
never
took
your
hat
off
to
anyone
save
on
equal
terms
but
when
uncle
john
tells
his
stories
you
know
he
used
to
stand
in
his
smock
frock
staring
at
the
gentry
as
they
drove
by
and
the
way
he
eats
his
soup
and
chuckles
when
the
servants
say
your
ladyship
to
mother
you
see
larry
he
didn
t
have
four
daughters
to
sit
upon
his
manners
and
train
him
up
the
way
he
should
go
like
the
governor
said
ted
smiling
broadly
as
certain
reminiscences
rose
in
his
mind
the
worst
of
it
is
that
colonel
and
aldersley
are
coming
here
from
friday
till
monday
yes
they
came
over
here
from
melbourne
three
weeks
ago
they
ve
been
at
government
house
for
two
weeks
look
here
ted
couldn
t
you
take
the
old
man
away
somewhere
during
that
time
well
i
m
blowed
you
have
got
a
cheek
larry
said
ted
sitting
straight
up
at
this
proposition
smuggle
the
old
bird
away
as
if
he
were
a
convict
and
all
for
what
an
elderly
frump
of
a
woman
who
says
yes
to
be
sure
eighty
times
a
day
and
a
man
who
would
rook
a
young
cub
that
had
hardly
shed
his
milk
teeth
oh
i
happen
to
know
a
good
deal
about
aldersley
i
tell
you
what
in
the
matter
of
straightforward
fair
play
the
man
isn
t
fit
to
brush
uncle
john
s
shoes
he
never
wears
s
always
great
creaking
wellington
boots
and
can
t
you
see
ted
that
to
have
embezzled
money
years
and
years
ago
would
be
pardonable
compared
to
taking
an
orange
in
your
fist
and
sucking
it
at
dessert
as
uncle
john
does
but
nothing
is
so
bad
as
his
stories
and
it
s
no
use
interrupting
him
he
only
gets
red
in
the
face
and
talks
yes
as
he
did
when
he
was
telling
once
how
he
and
father
borrowed
an
old
donkey
to
go
and
see
the
young
squire
s
first
meet
and
there
were
you
and
henrietta
pitching
away
about
the
queen
s
at
which
our
lotty
was
presented
by
jove
it
was
as
good
as
a
play
and
ted
laughed
as
good
as
a
play
echoed
laurette
her
face
reddening
with
vexation
yes
i
dare
say
it
will
be
as
good
as
a
play
for
the
aldersleys
you
may
call
a
frump
and
think
she
s
slow
but
let
me
tell
you
she
is
as
sharp
as
a
needle
she
agrees
with
everything
so
that
people
may
give
themselves
away
more
completely
she
keeps
a
diary
and
writes
pages
upon
pages
in
it
every
night
two
people
that
know
her
well
have
told
me
she
means
to
publish
a
book
on
life
at
the
antipodes
when
she
gets
back
to
england
and
of
course
uncle
john
would
be
regular
nuts
for
but
who
the
deuce
cares
what
these
tourist
people
say
they
either
put
down
stuff
that
everybody
knows
from
the
beginning
of
creation
or
they
tell
crammers
that
suck
in
nobody
but
their
own
friends
said
ted
lighting
a
cigar
and
resuming
his
attitude
and
it
isn
t
even
as
if
one
could
make
him
out
to
be
eccentric
or
an
oddity
went
on
laurette
in
a
bitter
tone
he
won
t
change
his
boots
in
the
house
but
he
ll
put
on
a
and
a
white
tie
that
goes
slipping
round
his
neck
like
a
hotel
waiter
s
and
it
s
ten
to
one
if
he
doesn
t
blurt
out
how
long
his
wife
was
in
service
with
him
before
he
married
well
you
may
put
your
money
on
it
that
all
the
world
over
people
have
got
to
be
in
service
or
have
enough
money
of
their
own
to
live
on
or
live
on
someone
else
returned
ted
with
philosophic
calm
you
re
always
kotooing
at
government
house
here
and
in
aren
t
they
all
in
service
living
on
money
they
get
out
of
the
country
for
looking
on
while
other
people
manage
affairs
it
s
a
perfect
chouse
when
aunt
sally
was
in
service
at
kataloonga
she
worked
for
all
the
money
she
earned
i
you
talk
as
if
you
hadn
t
a
scrap
of
proper
pride
about
you
you
take
good
care
only
to
ask
a
lady
to
be
your
own
wife
retorted
laurette
rather
vindictively
it
s
not
because
she
s
a
lady
it
s
just
because
she
s
stella
and
i
ve
known
her
all
my
life
and
every
other
girl
seems
common
and
flat
beside
her
answered
ted
holding
his
cigar
in
his
hand
as
he
spoke
a
expression
came
into
laurette
s
keen
dark
eyes
at
this
speech
but
before
she
could
make
any
rejoinder
ted
laughed
softly
in
that
gratified
way
which
is
significant
of
pleasant
recollections
by
jove
i
had
a
jolly
evening
i
never
knew
any
girl
that
can
make
as
much
out
of
a
little
thing
as
stella
does
sometimes
we
played
euchre
together
he
went
on
in
answer
to
laurette
s
interrogative
oh
stella
at
first
wouldn
t
play
for
money
because
she
hasn
t
a
sou
being
near
the
end
of
the
quarter
think
of
that
you
know
and
me
with
over
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
in
spanking
investments
not
to
mention
the
yearly
income
of
strathhaye
i
d
like
to
fill
all
her
pockets
with
gold
and
diamonds
and
i
can
t
offer
her
even
a
shabby
tenner
she
had
a
great
run
of
luck
with
the
cards
at
the
bower
and
joker
and
a
couple
of
high
trump
after
time
at
last
she
consented
to
play
for
money
and
it
luck
changed
i
tried
to
pack
the
cards
so
that
she
might
win
but
she
s
got
eyes
like
an
and
bowled
me
out
at
once
you
should
hear
all
the
penances
she
set
me
she
lost
five
shillings
and
gave
me
an
ted
took
a
note
out
of
his
and
gazed
at
it
fondly
i
ll
keep
this
till
all
i
ve
got
belongs
to
well
i
sometimes
fancy
that
will
never
be
the
case
after
all
returned
laurette
who
for
various
reasons
was
in
that
put
out
frame
of
mind
in
which
one
finds
a
gloomy
satisfaction
in
dashing
the
hopes
of
another
what
do
you
mean
by
that
asked
the
young
man
quickly
hasn
t
she
promised
to
come
to
see
you
in
melbourne
yes
in
a
sort
of
a
way
instead
of
being
grateful
and
pleased
at
the
idea
of
seeing
some
good
society
she
said
well
if
you
let
me
come
on
my
way
to
lullaboolagana
without
pledging
myself
beforehand
as
to
the
length
of
the
visit
and
laurette
mimicked
stella
s
tone
as
well
as
she
could
grossly
exaggerating
her
little
drawl
excuse
me
for
saying
so
larry
but
if
the
lord
meant
you
to
talk
like
stella
he
d
have
given
you
a
prettier
mouth
said
ted
with
slow
deliberation
and
as
for
good
have
you
better
than
she
has
been
in
all
her
life
oh
yes
a
narrow
churchy
little
clique
mixed
up
with
all
sorts
of
outsiders
people
here
always
rave
about
courtland
being
so
sweet
and
unworldly
it
s
my
belief
she
s
full
of
old
highland
pride
at
heart
they
re
on
a
sort
of
little
suburban
pinnacle
without
the
least
idea
of
anything
like
real
style
or
and
that
alice
speaking
of
themselves
as
the
poorer
classes
if
that
s
not
the
pride
that
apes
humility
i
should
like
to
know
what
is
i
don
t
know
why
you
ve
set
your
heart
so
on
wooing
that
girl
why
with
your
fortune
you
might
easily
marry
a
lord
s
but
what
the
devil
do
i
want
with
a
lord
s
daughter
cried
ted
in
an
amazed
voice
the
only
one
i
ever
knew
had
a
scrag
of
a
neck
and
was
as
yellow
as
a
oh
it
s
just
like
a
man
only
to
think
of
looks
i
d
like
to
know
who
all
stella
s
partners
were
at
the
emberly
ball
i
fancy
there
was
something
in
the
background
the
moment
i
spoke
of
the
affair
she
blushed
up
to
the
whites
of
her
but
stella
always
does
that
i
never
see
her
but
she
colours
off
and
on
twenty
times
an
yes
she
s
one
of
those
girls
that
always
look
more
charming
when
an
admirer
is
by
whether
they
care
for
him
or
not
she
has
that
slow
kind
of
and
a
droop
in
her
eyes
as
if
to
show
her
long
lashes
and
she
sometimes
says
the
most
biting
things
with
that
gentle
sort
of
drawl
and
then
she
laughs
right
out
when
you
least
expect
it
i
never
did
like
girls
that
find
things
so
amusing
which
are
serious
to
other
people
they
re
always
coquettes
more
or
less
oh
you
don
t
half
understand
stella
courtland
well
perhaps
a
fellow
sees
rather
more
than
is
good
for
him
of
the
sort
of
women
who
are
too
easily
understood
at
any
rate
i
understand
this
much
about
stella
i
d
sooner
hear
her
laugh
without
quite
understanding
why
she
s
amused
than
have
any
other
woman
in
the
world
at
my
feet
and
by
george
if
she
throws
me
over
at
the
it
s
all
u
p
with
me
i
know
that
they
re
coming
to
dinner
on
the
he
added
relighting
his
cigar
and
we
re
going
out
riding
together
most
mornings
till
well
ted
you
ve
always
been
very
good
to
me
when
we
ve
been
in
a
financial
fix
said
laurette
and
i
ll
do
what
i
can
for
you
as
i
said
before
i
think
part
of
a
season
in
melbourne
among
people
who
are
really
in
the
swim
may
open
stella
s
eyes
a
little
she
ll
find
what
it
is
to
have
a
fashionable
connection
and
good
horses
and
dresses
from
worth
and
the
last
touch
in
a
parisian
bonnet
she
ll
see
the
crowds
of
girls
nearly
as
well
born
as
she
is
and
more
fashionably
dressed
and
handsomer
whose
mouths
would
water
at
the
chance
of
an
offer
from
now
larry
there
you
re
out
of
it
completely
the
girls
you
call
handsomer
would
have
their
numbers
taken
down
the
instant
they
stood
in
the
same
room
with
stella
as
for
being
more
fashionably
whatever
she
puts
on
is
the
best
and
most
fashionable
and
it
s
just
the
same
with
what
she
says
she
may
mock
at
me
or
say
things
i
don
t
quite
catch
or
laugh
when
i
don
t
know
the
reason
why
but
whatever
she
does
is
just
refusing
by
the
lord
i
sometimes
think
that
just
a
proof
she
s
really
and
yet
i
believe
i
could
make
her
as
happy
as
any
other
fellow
ted
had
ceased
smoking
and
now
stared
before
him
with
a
look
of
care
on
his
face
which
was
very
unusual
now
ted
whatever
you
do
don
t
let
your
spirits
go
down
said
laurette
of
course
the
life
of
a
man
is
as
different
from
that
of
a
girl
as
chalk
is
from
cheese
after
all
the
more
a
girl
is
the
more
she
has
to
knuckle
under
to
the
inevitable
i
remember
when
i
used
to
stay
at
fairacre
in
the
old
days
stella
was
always
reading
some
rubbishy
old
fathers
or
tragedies
or
wild
german
stories
her
father
used
to
call
her
his
little
improvisatrice
and
she
would
sometimes
start
off
and
tell
stories
that
would
make
your
backbone
quiver
she
always
had
too
much
imagination
and
that
s
the
one
thing
a
woman
can
best
do
without
it
makes
her
draw
pictures
of
life
each
one
more
unlike
reality
than
the
other
but
in
the
end
she
ll
have
to
put
up
with
things
as
they
are
just
like
the
rest
of
us
women
have
dreams
only
to
give
them
up
when
they
when
laurette
took
to
moralizing
it
was
in
the
robust
strain
of
one
to
whom
delicacy
of
mind
was
not
a
lost
but
an
unknown
attribute
well
larry
if
nothing
comes
of
this
visit
to
before
this
time
next
year
stella
is
not
my
i
think
i
must
give
the
affair
up
for
good
and
quite
right
ted
the
end
of
everything
ought
to
come
before
it
s
too
late
whatever
lies
in
my
power
shall
be
done
i
think
melbourne
will
open
her
eyes
a
and
if
you
re
in
a
fix
for
some
tin
larry
before
the
end
of
the
just
let
me
know
said
ted
who
knew
by
experience
that
a
season
in
melbourne
seldom
passed
in
which
a
hundred
pounds
or
two
was
not
a
welcome
if
not
an
indispensable
gift
to
laurette
notwithstanding
the
station
in
the
mallee
country
worth
over
three
thousand
a
year
which
her
father
settled
on
her
when
she
married
the
hon
talbot
tareling
five
years
previously
a
look
of
vivid
interest
suddenly
came
into
laurette
s
face
it
was
the
being
in
a
fix
for
some
time
which
had
mainly
inspired
her
present
visit
to
her
father
well
laurette
began
and
suddenly
paused
various
thoughts
swept
through
her
mind
and
then
what
she
had
intended
to
say
ended
in
the
bald
statement
it
is
really
very
but
at
that
moment
certain
seed
had
dropped
into
fertile
that
was
destined
to
bear
fruit
in
the
not
distant
future
which
to
their
bitter
ruing
must
be
eaten
by
others
rather
than
by
herself
cuthbert
courtland
left
for
melbourne
on
the
of
december
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
edward
ritchie
called
at
fairacre
to
say
he
looked
dejected
and
very
much
out
of
sorts
weary
with
an
unusual
pallor
on
his
face
you
really
were
ill
then
on
the
said
stella
noticing
the
change
in
his
appearance
yes
of
course
did
you
think
i
would
stay
away
for
a
trifle
when
you
went
to
my
father
s
it
was
a
horrid
sell
altogether
two
of
the
best
horses
behaved
like
why
i
thought
you
were
at
edwin
emberly
s
place
near
reynella
yes
and
we
had
a
private
the
day
was
most
abominable
everything
went
wrong
if
i
had
only
stayed
at
you
see
ted
you
can
not
have
your
cake
and
eat
cake
it
was
a
cake
you
seem
to
have
an
idea
i
stayed
away
on
well
you
know
it
was
an
atrocious
day
with
a
fierce
east
gully
wind
it
s
always
a
little
cooler
at
not
on
the
with
an
amateur
steeplechase
and
only
a
mob
of
young
bachelors
but
then
in
the
evening
instead
of
dressing
for
dinner
no
doubt
you
lounged
in
pyjamas
and
smoked
and
had
long
drinks
out
on
the
verandas
whereas
we
fanned
ourselves
languidly
through
thirteen
courses
and
listened
to
the
good
old
bishop
speaking
on
surpliced
choirs
and
the
ultimate
cost
of
the
cathedral
i
certainly
thought
you
had
the
best
of
it
but
now
i
see
you
really
were
did
you
have
a
sunstroke
or
did
your
horse
roll
over
what
oh
it
was
just
what
answered
ritchie
grimly
the
fact
is
i
was
staring
hard
at
the
girl
as
he
spoke
but
something
in
her
gay
smiling
unconsciousness
arrested
the
words
on
his
i
believe
my
heart
has
gone
back
on
me
rather
badly
it
keeps
thumping
about
in
the
most
confounded
your
heart
ted
now
do
you
know
what
side
it
is
on
she
asked
laughingly
oh
yes
stella
it
s
all
very
well
for
you
you
re
on
the
right
side
of
the
hedge
you
never
had
a
day
s
illness
in
your
life
since
you
were
a
baby
i
ve
had
many
an
attack
and
to
have
old
mac
and
his
wife
bringing
you
in
you
can
t
drink
and
lie
awake
half
the
night
and
no
one
to
talk
to
or
ride
out
with
in
the
morning
and
have
some
you
can
t
wonder
i
run
off
to
melbourne
pretty
often
what
is
there
to
keep
me
at
home
now
if
you
were
i
m
not
going
to
say
any
more
just
now
i
am
going
on
to
strathhaye
to
see
to
a
few
things
there
and
then
i
m
going
to
have
a
complete
change
for
some
months
i
ve
been
feeling
rather
dicky
off
and
on
for
some
time
oh
yes
i
look
well
enough
generally
but
you
can
t
always
go
by
that
i
think
i
shall
give
up
keeps
a
fellow
racketing
about
what
sell
konrad
and
circe
and
all
the
rest
and
have
no
more
sweet
little
fillies
and
colts
that
are
so
knowing
and
thoroughbred
they
take
to
racing
almost
without
being
told
what
in
the
world
would
you
talk
about
ted
oh
i
wouldn
t
sell
them
all
i
ll
always
keep
good
horses
i
can
t
stand
any
other
kind
but
not
to
go
flying
about
from
one
to
the
other
it
begins
to
tell
on
a
fellow
after
a
few
years
i
think
i
ll
try
and
read
a
little
more
you
remember
the
list
of
books
i
got
you
to
give
me
once
well
there
s
a
big
boxful
at
strathhaye
never
opened
i
ll
take
it
with
me
but
i
don
t
think
i
can
ever
make
much
out
of
sonnets
why
have
you
actually
been
reading
sonnets
ah
poor
ted
you
must
have
been
feeling
yes
i
felt
very
low
last
night
after
i
got
home
and
i
thought
i
would
try
to
improve
my
mind
as
edwin
emberly
calls
it
i
thought
i
would
try
to
understand
more
about
the
things
you
care
for
i
have
a
wordsworth
that
was
given
me
for
a
prize
at
peter
s
oh
it
was
for
regular
attendance
when
a
fellow
was
there
for
a
couple
of
years
and
they
couldn
t
give
him
a
prize
for
anything
else
they
gave
him
one
for
not
playing
the
tally
as
i
was
a
boarder
i
couldn
t
do
that
very
and
did
you
really
get
out
your
prize
wordsworth
and
read
it
yes
i
read
some
of
the
sonnets
but
it
was
for
all
the
world
like
a
bullock
trying
to
jump
in
hobbles
he
makes
a
great
clanking
with
the
chains
and
he
heaves
up
his
horns
but
he
doesn
t
get
any
further
and
there
s
no
story
in
the
thing
at
least
if
there
is
it
s
so
thin
i
can
never
catch
it
now
when
i
was
about
ten
i
remember
you
read
me
the
lady
of
the
lake
once
and
by
jove
it
made
my
heart
beat
it
was
one
saturday
i
came
from
peter
s
to
stay
till
monday
cuth
was
always
very
kind
to
me
though
he
was
at
the
head
of
his
class
and
i
was
always
at
the
bottom
and
one
below
my
age
you
sat
up
in
the
branches
of
the
moreton
bay
and
i
sat
beside
you
and
turned
the
leaves
good
lord
i
wish
i
was
ten
and
you
nine
why
we
might
go
and
sit
in
the
branches
of
the
perhaps
it
isn
t
too
late
even
i
hate
those
words
too
late
said
ritchie
with
unusual
irritability
he
rose
and
strode
about
the
room
and
stared
out
through
one
of
the
windows
overlooking
the
garden
really
ted
shows
himself
in
quite
a
new
aspect
it
is
as
though
he
had
the
first
faint
beginnings
of
a
soul
thought
stella
looking
at
him
with
a
new
interest
why
do
you
hate
the
words
too
late
ted
have
you
any
association
with
them
she
said
going
up
to
him
where
he
stood
at
the
window
yes
we
had
a
hand
at
strathhaye
once
and
i
can
t
forget
the
way
he
said
the
words
over
and
over
at
the
last
well
he
was
hardly
really
but
the
life
he
led
made
him
seem
so
he
belonged
to
one
of
the
old
swell
families
in
england
and
got
engaged
but
had
no
money
to
marry
on
so
he
sold
out
of
a
crack
regiment
and
came
to
try
his
luck
at
the
diggings
he
was
among
the
lucky
and
his
mate
who
had
been
a
gamekeeper
on
his
uncle
s
estate
they
got
one
nugget
worth
four
thousand
pounds
and
there
was
more
to
follow
and
there
in
the
very
middle
of
his
luck
came
a
letter
telling
him
his
sweetheart
was
married
to
an
old
baboon
with
ever
so
many
thousands
a
year
it
put
him
off
his
chump
entirely
he
went
completely
to
the
bad
he
was
two
years
at
strathhaye
he
would
go
off
every
now
and
then
with
a
cheque
and
come
back
blue
with
the
his
coat
and
his
blanket
sold
for
a
last
nobbler
or
two
at
last
he
stayed
away
for
over
a
month
and
came
back
one
night
more
dead
than
alive
why
he
didn
t
do
away
with
himself
i
can
t
make
out
sometimes
i
believe
people
get
too
miserable
even
to
hang
themselves
we
had
the
doctor
for
him
but
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
except
give
him
some
stuff
that
made
it
easier
to
was
there
no
one
to
look
after
him
asked
stella
her
eyes
large
and
dim
with
pity
oh
yes
he
was
in
the
men
s
hut
and
mackenzie
used
to
go
to
him
for
a
couple
of
hours
every
day
i
used
to
go
in
too
most
days
but
by
jingo
i
can
t
think
of
anything
more
awkward
than
to
sit
by
a
fellow
like
that
when
you
know
he
s
dying
and
he
knows
that
you
know
you
can
t
even
say
you
hope
he
ll
soon
be
better
you
know
nothing
of
where
he
s
going
and
it
would
hardly
be
decent
to
talk
of
horses
and
classifying
wool
to
a
man
with
the
in
his
throat
so
to
speak
i
offered
to
read
the
bible
to
him
but
i
was
always
coming
across
some
queer
yarn
that
made
one
feel
anyhow
at
last
he
gave
me
a
little
purple
book
of
common
prayer
to
read
but
there
what
was
the
good
of
reading
the
publick
baptism
of
infants
or
the
churching
of
women
or
the
solemnization
of
matrimony
oh
ted
why
didn
t
you
read
the
psalms
or
the
visitation
of
the
sick
or
a
collect
said
stella
unable
to
refrain
from
a
smile
though
the
picture
called
up
by
the
young
man
s
unstudied
narrative
touched
her
deeply
well
you
see
you
know
the
run
of
the
but
i
don
t
and
i
just
used
to
start
off
where
i
opened
it
once
i
began
with
the
burial
of
the
dead
but
i
wasn
t
sorry
for
it
made
poor
old
travers
laugh
so
not
yet
my
yet
he
said
that
was
a
few
evenings
before
he
died
and
just
two
days
before
a
lawyer
s
letter
came
telling
him
he
was
heir
to
his
uncle
s
estate
the
old
man
was
dead
the
eldest
son
had
come
to
grief
hunting
buffaloes
somewhere
in
north
america
and
the
second
had
got
killed
in
the
zulu
war
years
before
so
there
was
this
estate
with
thirteen
or
fourteen
thousand
a
year
for
travers
to
step
into
just
as
he
got
his
last
two
days
before
he
turned
up
his
toes
i
was
sorry
the
letter
came
before
he
died
he
was
rather
gone
in
his
mind
what
with
and
one
thing
and
another
and
after
he
read
the
letter
everything
about
him
passed
out
of
his
mind
and
he
thought
he
was
a
young
fellow
with
the
ball
at
his
feet
and
he
and
his
nellie
were
to
be
married
i
sat
by
his
bedside
in
the
dusk
and
he
kept
on
saying
i
am
so
glad
this
has
come
before
it
was
too
late
nell
it
is
sometimes
awful
i
knew
of
a
fellow
that
went
to
the
dogs
away
in
australia
but
then
the
girl
he
loved
threw
him
over
you
would
never
do
that
nellie
darling
thank
god
it
s
not
too
s
not
too
late
by
jove
you
know
it
gave
me
a
lump
in
the
throat
as
big
as
a
potato
somehow
it
was
worse
than
if
he
said
it
too
late
and
he
kept
on
hammering
at
the
same
thing
and
thanking
god
she
was
so
true
to
him
and
marking
down
on
a
map
where
they
were
going
for
their
and
then
he
would
say
now
nell
don
t
keep
me
waiting
long
at
the
church
i
have
been
waiting
such
a
long
time
and
sometimes
i
had
the
most
awful
dreams
but
it
s
not
too
late
he
would
begin
again
i
was
glad
when
it
was
all
ah
what
pitiful
broken
episodes
many
lives
are
said
stella
softly
all
that
might
have
saved
them
is
touch
leads
to
the
catastrophe
and
then
silence
and
the
great
play
goes
on
just
the
same
and
yet
how
good
it
is
to
be
alive
and
see
the
sky
and
look
at
the
roses
will
you
give
me
a
rose
before
i
go
stella
kind
would
you
like
one
of
those
you
re
fondest
well
those
i
love
the
very
best
are
the
white
fairy
roses
and
the
cruel
east
wind
on
the
scorched
the
last
of
them
buds
and
all
but
i
can
give
you
a
gloire
de
and
stella
would
you
mind
giving
me
that
book
with
the
lady
of
the
lake
in
oh
with
great
pleasure
and
just
write
my
name
in
it
the
here
s
a
little
parcel
don
t
open
it
till
i
m
gone
you
know
you
said
you
liked
opening
but
ted
i
should
see
what
it
is
before
i
take
no
you
can
settle
about
that
when
i
see
you
in
stella
took
the
little
square
parcel
and
looked
at
it
doubtfully
it
s
not
another
kooditcha
shoe
they
passed
into
the
library
where
stella
got
the
book
and
wrote
e
ritchie
on
the
then
they
stepped
out
into
the
garden
and
got
an
unopened
rose
fragrant
and
smiling
red
at
the
lips
i
am
sorry
your
mother
and
alice
are
to
them
for
me
time
i
meet
them
i
we
shall
see
now
stella
give
me
your
two
hands
and
say
god
bless
you
ted
she
gave
him
her
hands
and
he
looked
into
her
face
so
long
and
steadfastly
that
she
suddenly
crimsoned
under
his
gaze
and
said
with
a
little
pout
ted
you
mustn
t
be
so
solemn
one
would
think
you
were
going
to
central
australia
or
to
greenland
in
very
bad
say
it
god
bless
you
ted
he
bent
and
kissed
her
hands
and
then
hurried
away
without
once
looking
behind
stella
stood
where
he
left
her
till
she
heard
the
sound
of
his
horse
s
hoofs
ringing
on
the
roadway
as
he
passed
up
barton
terrace
and
then
traces
of
contending
emotions
swept
over
her
face
poor
old
ted
i
believe
he
is
in
some
trouble
what
if
his
health
is
really
affected
but
i
can
t
believe
it
that
is
a
way
men
have
if
the
least
thing
is
take
themselves
as
seriously
as
if
they
were
stuffed
llamas
well
i
m
almost
sorry
i
wasn
t
more
sympathetic
only
it
is
so
and
the
thought
of
ted
trying
to
read
sonnets
for
her
sake
overcame
her
with
amusement
yet
this
was
soon
followed
by
a
feeling
akin
to
in
the
old
days
she
had
read
to
to
him
of
what
interested
her
for
the
last
two
or
three
years
when
they
met
her
chief
feeling
was
a
wondering
amusement
that
one
who
had
learned
to
read
at
all
should
so
completely
escape
all
tincture
of
books
she
had
got
into
the
habit
of
listening
to
apprehending
his
point
of
avoiding
any
direct
personal
talk
that
might
influence
him
or
modify
his
mental
habits
but
was
he
so
entirely
beyond
any
intellectual
far
removed
from
kinship
with
matters
that
lay
beyond
the
common
grooves
of
common
life
why
had
she
relinquished
those
ardent
dreams
of
being
a
power
for
good
in
the
lives
of
those
to
whom
she
was
dear
her
face
grew
hot
as
she
recalled
the
frivolous
way
in
which
she
had
met
his
resolution
of
giving
up
and
yet
was
there
any
other
pursuit
that
seemed
so
completely
to
arrest
the
better
development
of
a
man
s
paralyze
the
worthier
interests
of
life
the
perpetual
contact
with
the
ignoble
rabble
whose
keenest
interest
was
the
excitement
of
betting
and
winning
money
for
which
they
had
not
not
this
render
the
mind
more
and
more
callous
to
all
that
was
worth
living
for
and
yet
she
had
almost
mocked
his
recoil
from
his
past
devotion
to
the
racecourse
her
action
suddenly
appeared
to
her
in
so
odious
a
light
that
she
longed
to
see
ted
again
for
a
few
moments
to
ask
his
pardon
for
her
mocking
encourage
him
in
his
tell
him
that
their
native
country
was
full
of
work
which
needed
honest
men
and
honest
money
how
many
fields
were
white
for
the
many
labourers
were
needed
to
dedicate
their
whole
powers
to
the
world
s
service
oh
i
shall
have
to
come
back
to
being
as
much
in
earnest
as
ever
she
thought
half
smiling
at
her
rising
zeal
and
then
the
thought
of
ted
blundering
through
the
publick
baptism
of
infants
beside
the
poor
dying
man
made
her
feel
inclined
to
laugh
and
cry
at
the
same
moment
the
strange
bitter
pathos
of
that
human
wreckage
which
drifts
into
so
many
currents
of
our
australian
life
fastened
on
her
delicately
nurtured
in
the
old
homes
of
the
old
world
as
well
as
the
luxurious
ones
of
the
new
and
in
the
end
going
completely
under
in
the
rough
wild
manner
of
the
veriest
waifs
this
is
misery
of
the
kind
which
weaves
the
most
tragic
thread
in
the
web
of
existence
the
slow
but
inexorable
deterioration
of
character
makes
oftentimes
a
strong
seizure
on
the
startled
spirit
oh
it
is
all
too
cruel
said
the
girl
to
herself
and
then
a
curious
sense
of
undefined
peril
came
over
of
those
quick
unreasoning
apprehensions
often
strong
enough
to
give
a
sense
of
physical
pain
to
which
minds
of
fibre
are
sometimes
subject
it
is
as
though
chains
of
consciousness
apart
from
the
centre
of
thought
were
at
work
storing
up
impressions
piecing
together
disconnected
events
casual
words
and
signs
that
have
floated
through
the
brain
without
leaving
traces
strong
enough
for
waking
memory
till
the
total
is
summed
up
in
an
expression
of
imminent
or
latent
danger
which
is
suddenly
flashed
on
the
mind
with
bewildering
vividness
and
yet
the
process
by
which
this
is
conveyed
is
sealed
from
knowledge
there
is
no
orthodox
channel
of
intercourse
between
these
swift
intuitions
and
the
workaday
brain
immersed
in
the
details
of
daily
life
do
you
think
it
does
a
fellow
any
good
to
come
a
cropper
in
that
way
was
one
of
the
reminiscences
stella
found
rising
in
her
mind
after
the
vague
little
shock
of
dread
had
left
her
she
went
back
into
the
and
there
was
the
little
square
parcel
still
unopened
it
was
a
brown
morocco
case
which
opened
on
pressing
a
spring
and
disclosed
a
magnificent
pearl
brooch
in
the
form
of
a
upon
row
of
graduated
pearls
with
a
very
large
one
in
the
centre
and
large
ones
round
it
the
next
a
little
smaller
and
so
on
to
the
last
row
which
were
small
exquisite
pearls
there
was
a
little
note
in
ted
s
round
schoolboyish
hand
dear
stella
this
is
for
your
birthday
in
april
they
are
shark
bay
pearls
got
by
the
boat
i
have
an
interest
in
you
used
to
take
little
presents
from
me
before
on
your
birthday
once
i
brought
you
a
little
beggar
of
a
sparrow
with
only
a
few
feathers
and
tried
to
get
a
kiss
for
it
but
you
didn
t
see
it
by
jove
you
owe
me
an
awful
lot
you
know
i
hope
you
will
like
the
pearls
i
got
the
there
be
two
s
or
three
in
that
word
make
them
up
in
a
for
good
luck
mind
you
i
know
very
well
i
m
not
half
good
enough
for
you
but
then
neither
would
any
other
fellow
be
i
wish
was
the
day
i
was
to
see
you
in
melbourne
you
must
be
a
bit
of
a
flirt
stella
the
governor
is
always
quite
gone
on
you
afresh
after
he
sees
you
he
likes
a
girl
with
plenty
of
go
in
her
and
you
always
tell
him
some
funny
story
over
which
he
keeps
on
chuckling
if
you
re
not
in
when
i
call
i
may
tell
you
that
i
was
awfully
cut
up
i
couldn
t
leave
heronshaw
on
the
so
as
to
dine
at
home
i
m
getting
of
races
i
shan
t
go
to
one
till
i
see
you
again
i
am
going
quite
into
the
bush
for
a
thorough
change
stella
always
yours
ed
stella
looked
long
at
the
pearls
they
were
so
soft
and
lustrous
with
that
glowing
moist
look
as
if
damp
with
the
sea
under
whose
myriad
waves
they
took
shape
and
grew
within
a
creature
that
had
the
breath
of
life
is
it
this
that
gives
them
the
wistful
tenderness
which
marks
them
from
all
other
jewels
that
and
perhaps
the
melancholy
moanings
of
the
sea
in
which
they
were
cradled
it
is
much
too
costly
a
indeed
this
endless
wooing
is
to
have
an
unfortunate
close
thought
stella
with
a
smile
well
it
should
rob
matrimony
of
some
of
its
terror
to
marry
the
youth
who
at
nine
or
ten
tried
to
bribe
one
to
kiss
him
with
a
from
that
day
till
she
met
him
again
she
consciously
from
time
to
time
faced
the
possibility
of
this
unfortunate
vi
some
of
the
letters
which
stella
wrote
to
her
brother
will
best
convey
the
tenor
of
her
life
during
the
months
that
intervened
before
she
left
for
melbourne
and
lullaboolagana
they
were
the
last
she
wrote
from
the
home
of
her
infancy
and
serene
and
happy
in
the
chequered
journey
of
life
they
show
her
on
one
side
gay
playful
open
to
every
impression
in
love
with
life
and
beauty
as
ardently
as
a
greek
finding
food
for
mirth
at
the
core
of
much
which
outwardly
wears
a
mask
of
solemn
gravity
on
the
other
side
she
exhibits
a
cold
logical
faculty
for
drawing
pitiless
inferences
from
the
laws
of
nature
from
those
lives
which
had
touched
her
own
and
had
become
bankrupt
in
all
life
s
promises
of
joy
prone
also
to
that
severe
disenchanted
estimate
of
human
affairs
springing
from
the
austere
strand
inevitably
woven
into
minds
that
have
at
one
time
been
nourished
on
the
sustained
enthusiasm
of
supernatural
the
writings
of
saints
and
fathers
whose
keynote
is
the
lofty
renunciation
of
those
who
look
on
the
world
and
its
most
coveted
distinctions
as
the
empty
pageant
of
a
passing
show
fairacre
adelaide
january
you
ask
me
to
be
sure
and
write
when
the
thought
arises
how
i
should
like
to
tell
cuthbert
about
this
if
i
could
only
have
a
good
long
talk
with
him
now
but
consider
my
friend
what
a
cold
little
viper
a
pen
is
when
you
want
really
to
talk
face
to
face
when
a
word
a
look
suggests
thoughts
that
had
else
hardly
struggled
into
existence
and
then
apart
from
the
chill
which
the
frosty
tip
of
a
pen
engenders
in
one
s
most
communicative
moods
has
not
ink
an
immemorial
right
to
be
dull
still
i
perceive
a
certain
advantage
in
saying
whatever
i
like
feeling
sure
that
in
a
day
and
a
half
you
will
gravely
read
it
all
whereas
in
a
one
is
open
to
be
skipped
like
an
elderly
newspaper
yawned
at
like
a
tedious
play
one
is
afraid
to
skip
a
letter
too
cavalierly
there
might
be
something
in
it
for
after
all
life
has
many
surprises
as
women
generally
sit
by
the
hearth
all
their
lives
like
a
cat
that
has
given
up
hunting
they
should
early
learn
how
to
purr
and
write
letters
do
you
know
the
tradition
among
some
of
our
aboriginal
tribes
that
their
creator
taught
men
how
to
spear
kangaroos
and
women
how
to
dig
roots
now
that
you
are
on
the
pacific
of
a
spearer
of
a
vile
simile
i
am
sorry
but
that
is
the
worst
of
primitive
seldom
afford
good
metaphors
i
imagine
that
i
meant
to
say
i
must
learn
to
dig
with
my
intimate
with
it
make
it
loyal
to
me
so
as
to
keep
at
bay
that
estrangement
which
often
creeps
between
people
when
they
are
apart
what
a
fierce
jealousy
stirs
me
at
the
thought
that
time
and
absence
might
dare
to
nip
with
lean
fingers
at
our
lifelong
friendship
shall
i
divide
my
letters
between
daily
events
and
the
natural
sprouts
of
my
own
understanding
someone
has
said
that
matter
of
fact
is
the
comfortable
resource
of
dull
people
but
when
you
come
to
fold
it
up
in
pages
stamp
it
and
send
it
five
hundred
miles
or
so
matter
of
fact
should
have
its
whiskers
trimmed
and
its
obesity
buttoned
up
in
a
slim
jacket
like
an
s
monkey
but
if
you
do
this
when
you
are
so
good
and
calm
that
you
have
no
history
what
remains
all
this
day
the
wind
has
abused
the
privilege
it
has
of
being
intolerable
how
i
envy
people
who
unless
they
go
out
on
foot
hardly
perceive
that
this
of
australia
is
running
riot
you
know
the
habits
of
our
climate
at
such
times
the
air
dry
and
parching
with
puffs
and
gusts
warm
as
if
they
had
escaped
from
caldrons
of
sand
and
that
unceasing
undertone
whether
the
wind
blows
high
or
low
as
of
things
being
swirled
along
the
earth
it
is
the
motion
of
countless
little
twigs
of
skeleton
leaves
of
bits
of
bark
of
old
frayed
nonentities
of
desert
grit
borne
along
in
a
whirl
of
dead
resurrection
by
a
wind
that
surely
has
not
its
compeer
on
earth
for
dragging
things
from
near
and
far
that
have
been
long
spent
and
buried
into
the
unmerciful
light
of
day
you
were
spared
another
page
or
two
regarding
the
hot
wind
by
kirsty
who
came
half
an
hour
ago
to
the
saying
that
poor
old
honora
wanted
to
see
me
she
s
the
warse
o
drink
and
as
hoarse
as
a
corbie
there
s
nae
use
in
helping
her
at
a
it
s
mony
a
day
sinsyne
that
she
began
thae
evil
ways
said
kirsty
with
those
severe
lines
round
her
mouth
growing
still
severer
sall
i
say
you
re
too
busy
miss
stella
needless
to
say
i
was
not
poor
honora
she
was
more
sunburnt
and
draggled
than
ever
her
clothes
more
her
hat
more
desperately
broken
altogether
she
looked
one
of
the
most
forlorn
targets
of
the
darts
of
misfortune
that
could
well
be
seen
on
the
world
s
turbulent
stage
still
with
it
all
she
maintained
that
inflexible
air
of
being
only
one
more
victim
of
the
stratagems
of
fate
oh
she
was
well
all
things
considered
many
a
poor
thing
with
a
bad
husband
and
undutiful
children
would
even
now
like
to
change
places
with
her
but
things
had
gone
against
her
again
work
was
not
easy
to
get
and
since
she
had
set
up
housekeeping
she
had
more
worries
yis

scandalized

you
believe

not
quite
so
young
as
he
was
it
seems
that
as
soon
as
he
is
a
year
old
a
collie
dog
begins
to
fall
into
sombre
reveries
on
the
flight
of
time
on
free
will
and
the
yoke
of
necessity
or
are
there
infinitely
more
important
themes
that
occupy
the
thoughts
of
a
creature
who
has
the
felicity
to
be
born
with
four
legs
and
an
oblique
tan
spot
above
each
eye
i
whispered
your
name
to
him
this
moment
and
he
wagged
his
tail
thirteen
times
have
angels
a
more
eloquent
mode
of
expressing
goodwill
certainly
man
has
not
still
i
am
not
sorry
that
in
our
arduous
ascent
in
the
scale
of
nature
we
lost
our
tails
do
you
not
know
by
instinct
the
people
who
would
jocularly
catch
us
by
them
as
a
token
of
good
fellowship
notably
those
who
pride
themselves
on
being
too
sincere
to
take
kindly
to
the
conventionalities
of
life
and
on
being
the
artificers
of
their
own
manners
now
think
over
it
and
see
if
blank
and
dash
and
snap
do
not
appear
to
you
in
a
more
lurid
light
than
ever
do
you
not
find
a
fresh
glow
of
dislike
welling
up
as
you
reflect
yes
that
is
the
stamp
of
man
who
would
infallibly
pull
one
s
tail
vii
fairacre
january
when
a
benevolent
fairy
bestows
on
me
a
island
or
some
kingdom
upon
the
mainland
i
shall
have
a
carriage
as
capacious
as
a
state
barge
drawn
by
two
horses
tall
and
high
stepping
likewise
a
slim
footman
and
a
fat
elderly
coachman
this
is
the
state
with
which
i
was
encircled
yesterday
when
i
drove
out
with
marwood
in
her
equipage
and
let
me
tell
you
my
dear
that
i
found
the
change
from
our
lowly
pony
carriage
and
leo
s
diminutive
trot
to
these
exalted
prosperities
very
soothing
how
deferential
and
all
that
ilk
are
when
one
goes
about
with
such
a
halo
of
wealth
but
never
suppose
that
i
am
going
to
revile
human
nature
on
these
grounds
no
when
i
reflected
on
the
matter
i
was
unmoved
and
dispassionate
to
an
edifying
degree
after
all
i
said
money
is
a
great
power
pray
are
you
dazzled
with
the
brilliant
originality
of
this
but
don
t
interrupt
reflections
for
though
doing
so
may
add
much
to
your
joy
it
is
death
to
the
homilist
money
is
at
the
root
of
all
civilization
and
art
at
this
point
an
aboriginal
family
bore
in
sight
who
pointed
the
moral
in
a
striking
mother
and
two
picaninnies
were
all
barefooted
in
a
word
a
tattered
government
blanket
a
couple
of
waddies
and
the
rakings
of
a
by
way
of
clothing
comprised
all
their
worldly
possessions
thrilled
with
the
justice
of
my
remarks
i
went
on
society
is
held
together
by
mutual
wants
the
unfortunate
devils
who
have
not
wherewithal
to
satisfy
these
must
go
to
the
wall
how
unavoidable
then
that
money
should
confer
distinction
it
is
true
that
wealth
draws
out
the
flunkeyism
of
the
average
mortal
in
a
pitiful
way
but
may
not
flunkeyism
itself
be
termed
the
exaggerated
respect
of
poor
natures
for
an
absolute
power
etc
i
do
not
know
any
place
in
which
one
may
make
reflections
so
fairly
and
comfortably
as
in
a
carriage
do
you
know
how
profoundly
benevolent
and
incoherent
marwood
is
in
her
charities
she
really
is
a
perfect
de
of
incongruities
you
find
her
telling
you
how
atrociously
worth
charges
for
a
simple
gray
silk
and
before
she
has
finished
marshalling
her
figures
she
ejaculates
but
why
should
we
worms
of
the
earth
take
so
much
thought
wherewithal
shall
we
be
clothed
the
sheep
and
caterpillar
wore
that
very
clothing
long
before
my
imagination
is
not
nimble
enough
to
take
in
so
varied
an
assortment
of
metaphors
without
bruising
its
shins
first
as
to
the
phrase
a
worm
of
the
earth
i
no
sooner
hear
it
than
i
picture
myself
as
a
creeping
thing
without
hands
or
feet
or
face
living
in
a
carcase
underground
without
light
or
sun
or
air
before
this
gruesome
picture
is
complete
enter
a
sheep
with
a
waist
in
a
fine
homespun
and
a
caterpillar
trailing
a
trained
silk
you
see
they
wore
that
very
clothing
long
before
tis
to
no
purpose
for
a
sober
man
to
knock
at
the
door
of
poesy
says
plato
so
it
is
with
me
the
flights
that
people
take
to
read
a
lesson
to
man
s
pride
confuse
rather
than
edify
me
one
of
the
visits
marwood
paid
as
we
were
on
our
way
to
her
house
was
to
a
family
whose
head
she
described
as
a
brand
plucked
from
the
burning
judge
whether
one
who
lounges
about
his
house
in
the
afternoon
with
unlaced
boots
a
stubbly
beard
of
a
week
s
growth
and
smoking
a
short
black
pipe
seems
a
fit
subject
for
such
a
description
but
then
perhaps
the
appositeness
of
a
plucked
brand
rests
with
the
eye
that
sees
it
certainly
he
might
have
been
engaged
in
drowning
his
youngest
child
in
the
tank
or
dancing
on
the
prostrate
form
of
his
wife
you
hope
that
i
am
going
on
with
my
collection
of
aboriginal
myths
and
customs
i
hope
the
same
so
it
is
evident
that
life
is
partly
given
us
that
we
may
keep
on
hoping
and
nothing
come
of
it
why
do
i
not
set
to
more
seriously
in
the
first
place
i
hate
to
set
to
in
the
second
i
abhor
more
and
if
i
could
hang
myself
for
aught
it
would
be
because
there
is
such
a
word
as
seriously
not
only
in
the
dictionary
where
one
may
endure
anything
but
also
in
people
s
mouths
have
i
expressed
myself
too
strongly
then
i
without
any
thought
of
amendment
this
i
believe
is
the
only
thing
that
makes
repentance
viii
fairacre
february
thank
you
for
your
kind
inquiries
after
my
chickens
they
thrive
apace
ten
out
of
twelve
of
them
seem
to
have
gained
a
firm
footing
in
the
world
one
especially
a
buffy
white
nimble
creature
is
so
trenchant
a
warrior
in
the
battle
of
life
that
we
have
named
it
hector
not
after
the
family
but
the
classical
hero
he
picks
crumbs
out
of
his
brothers
mouths
as
if
he
were
a
christian
merchant
he
hops
on
his
mother
s
back
and
stretching
his
neck
spoils
twenty
muscatel
grapes
in
half
a
minute
he
snatches
happy
insects
out
of
the
sunshine
and
with
one
slight
arch
of
his
neck
hurls
them
into
an
unshrived
eternity
the
place
where
his
tail
ought
to
be
is
fast
developing
a
tiny
yellow
comb
is
faintly
visible
alas
i
see
plainly
that
time
who
scatters
his
with
a
ruthless
hand
is
bent
on
his
destruction
for
the
day
on
which
he
becomes
what
kirsty
terms
a
cockerel
his
fate
is
sealed
but
then
our
own
special
doom
awaits
each
of
us
and
hector
has
this
advantage
in
being
shelled
a
fowl
he
never
sinks
into
sallow
meditations
as
to
his
coming
fate
the
present
hour
with
its
worms
and
sunshine
and
sweet
opportunities
of
theft
is
enough
for
him
he
listens
to
all
the
speculations
that
can
be
addressed
to
him
with
unmoved
composure
only
this
morning
one
held
him
in
her
hand
and
said
ah
little
feathered
atom
so
lately
shelled
from
one
eternity
into
another
fleeting
pilgrim
in
a
passing
show
confined
to
a
few
roods
of
earth
yet
linked
by
subtle
chains
to
the
remotest
perchance
to
spirit
itself
to
know
thee
wholly
how
largely
must
the
boundaries
of
human
knowledge
be
widened
time
and
space
and
the
solar
are
necessary
to
thy
hector
listened
with
round
rolling
eyes
but
at
this
point
he
made
a
sudden
dart
at
the
speaker
s
mouth
as
if
it
suddenly
struck
him
that
it
was
alive
and
possibly
as
good
to
eat
as
a
beetle
yesterday
i
made
several
visits
to
sick
people
two
of
rupert
and
been
slowly
dying
for
nearly
two
years
do
you
remember
hearing
mother
speak
of
them
one
of
consumption
the
other
of
some
internal
malady
can
one
witness
such
long
unavailing
struggles
without
pondering
why
human
beings
should
endure
so
much
all
to
no
purpose
people
speak
about
waiting
for
the
end
but
has
not
the
end
of
the
body
come
when
it
is
smitten
with
an
incurable
agonizing
malady
it
would
seem
that
when
i
enter
on
moralities
my
dear
you
and
i
are
undone
like
salt
in
water
at
any
rate
you
will
not
feel
disposed
to
grumble
that
just
at
the
moment
i
was
dipping
the
inquisitive
beak
of
my
pen
in
ink
to
come
without
further
phrase
or
disguise
on
the
yolk
at
the
heart
of
euthanasia
who
should
call
but
willie
stein
you
know
how
he
makes
these
sudden
appearances
from
the
far
north
the
thermometer
is
very
high
the
wind
is
from
the
east
and
threatens
to
veer
to
the
north
there
are
crowds
of
undelightful
things
that
ought
to
be
done
the
day
before
duty
like
an
old
hag
that
ought
to
be
burnt
at
the
stake
for
sedition
peers
in
at
you
from
time
to
time
and
then
to
fill
up
the
measure
in
comes
willie
here
is
an
aboriginal
myth
he
told
me
once
upon
a
time
the
pelicans
went
to
fish
and
found
a
great
deal
of
barracoota
which
they
left
in
a
gully
while
they
went
for
more
up
came
some
greedy
thieving
magpies
and
stole
the
booty
the
pelicans
in
revenge
rolled
them
in
the
ashes
and
that
is
the
reason
why
they
are
partly
black
this
belongs
to
the
same
class
of
legend
as
that
of
the
venomous
snake
who
made
the
moon
angry
by
killing
so
many
blacks
till
at
last
she
burnt
its
head
as
it
slept
in
the
grass
at
night
so
that
is
the
reason
why
its
head
is
black
and
its
bite
harmless
you
see
australian
myths
have
this
in
common
with
those
of
classic
greece
that
they
also
endeavour
to
give
an
account
of
the
origin
of
things
you
ask
about
my
translation
of
faust
i
have
not
done
so
many
lines
per
day
since
you
left
you
see
the
second
part
is
to
our
speech
with
its
many
words
a
perfect
trap
for
the
translator
i
am
glad
however
you
encouraged
me
to
undertake
this
task
for
in
no
other
way
can
one
draw
so
near
to
the
heart
of
a
work
in
a
foreign
tongue
but
as
for
any
literary
value
of
course
the
thing
is
naught
i
could
make
you
die
of
laughing
at
subtilties
screwed
words
and
rhymes
hacked
and
raked
all
to
no
purpose
the
performance
is
like
nothing
so
much
as
a
that
hath
his
eyes
blinded
trying
to
race
a
soaring
eagle
but
then
i
feel
that
i
have
climbed
a
little
nearer
to
is
there
anything
in
life
more
delightful
than
the
tranquil
friendship
that
grows
out
of
long
and
frequent
intercourse
with
a
great
writer
one
who
is
not
only
among
the
most
majestic
sons
of
light
but
a
frontier
savant
of
penetrated
to
the
outposts
of
human
nature
and
unflinchingly
noted
the
of
good
and
evil
early
next
week
i
am
going
on
one
of
my
periodical
visits
to
and
stein
they
have
staying
with
them
just
now
an
old
friend
who
arrived
from
germany
a
few
days
man
who
is
as
steeped
in
research
as
a
seaweed
is
in
ozone
but
is
it
well
if
not
it
ought
to
be
it
is
cruel
of
you
to
vaunt
the
praises
of
the
melbourne
climate
over
ours
when
we
are
having
such
atrocious
hot
winds
yesterday
some
of
us
did
nothing
but
lie
on
the
floor
in
apostolic
raiment
swallow
ice
and
feebly
murmur
the
old
aboriginal
incantation
sun
sun
burn
your
your
internal
substance
and
go
down
fairacre
february
if
i
were
a
south
sea
islander
this
is
the
day
on
which
i
would
beat
my
idol
black
and
blue
i
have
completely
fallen
out
with
myself
dearest
dear
do
not
put
up
your
eyebrows
in
that
unbelieving
way
you
should
have
heard
me
speaking
to
myself
a
little
while
ago
what
sort
of
a
creature
do
you
call
yourself
i
said
if
the
wind
is
from
the
if
a
dress
is
a
misfit
if
people
say
the
same
things
to
you
if
they
say
nothing
at
all
you
are
like
a
bundle
of
and
disagreeable
all
over
what
have
you
done
to
your
soul
that
it
does
not
raise
you
above
the
petty
malice
of
the
passing
hour
go
to
someone
who
does
not
know
you
so
well
as
i
i
won
t
have
you
at
any
price
and
lo
my
friend
here
i
am
with
a
pen
and
a
scrubby
little
and
a
sheet
of
paper
and
a
shivering
homeless
ego
thrust
from
its
accustomed
throne
may
i
come
to
you
do
not
ask
me
inside
if
you
are
busy
writing
sermons
no
it
wouldn
t
be
safe
just
give
me
a
mat
at
the
door
and
one
of
the
old
poets
till
you
have
finished
it
would
be
no
use
making
a
confidant
of
me
you
could
not
feel
for
me
if
i
said
my
pretty
pink
de
has
been
spoilt
in
the
sleeves
you
might
try
to
look
sympathetic
but
you
would
really
be
smiling
inside
and
yet
greater
failures
have
much
greater
consolations
if
you
construct
a
wrong
system
of
ethics
you
make
your
claim
surer
to
be
ranked
a
philosopher
if
you
make
it
clear
that
the
majority
of
mankind
must
be
damned
you
may
possibly
be
reckoned
severe
but
are
sure
to
be
considered
a
sound
christian
but
what
comfort
can
be
drawn
from
having
the
wrong
sort
of
sleeve
i
defy
you
to
find
any
or
if
you
do
tis
because
you
are
not
a
woman
you
is
that
the
only
reason
why
you
have
become
a
house
divided
against
itself
well
some
of
your
sex
have
ere
now
pretended
to
be
racked
with
toothache
when
they
were
really
suffering
from
heartache
but
i
deny
the
imputation
besides
what
so
reasonable
as
to
be
quite
out
of
humour
with
one
s
self
from
time
to
time
and
yet
an
invincible
is
one
of
the
boons
i
envy
your
philistine
man
or
woman
take
mrs
towers
for
instance
who
chants
eternal
pæans
to
everything
she
possesses
from
her
eleven
children
to
her
apricots
from
her
husband
to
her
ligurian
bees
you
know
how
one
seldom
meets
her
without
hearing
of
some
visitor
who
has
travelled
far
and
wide
and
yet
regards
his
visit
to
hawthorn
vale
as
the
happiest
event
in
a
life
not
barren
in
joy
how
it
must
save
the
tissues
of
the
brain
to
be
in
such
a
state
of
mind
as
that
perennially
this
afternoon
esther
and
the
three
children
arrived
poor
dear
it
is
so
sad
to
see
her
in
mourning
still
unless
husbands
have
been
very
angelic
it
seems
rather
a
mistake
to
wear
mourning
so
long
but
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
subjects
i
should
skip
i
have
some
thoughts
in
future
of
trying
to
imitate
providence
in
letting
events
fall
heavily
or
lightly
as
they
may
but
without
remark
or
expostulation
this
will
be
all
the
easier
because
the
children
have
taken
entire
possession
of
me
we
are
going
for
an
endless
ramble
by
the
torrens
away
towards
the
hills
beyond
windsor
and
all
the
other
pretty
little
townships
crowded
with
gardens
and
orchards
and
orangeries
and
fields
of
vegetables
perhaps
we
shall
see
some
mountain
ducks
on
the
river
and
hear
the
loud
ringing
calls
of
cuckoos
away
in
the
tops
here
is
a
from
your
nephew
clement
why
clem
you
are
growing
frightfully
tall
and
yet
it
is
not
so
very
long
since
you
were
in
petticoats
no
but
you
aunt
stella
are
in
them
still
will
you
never
grow
out
of
them
i
felt
too
crushed
to
attempt
a
reply
i
think
i
shall
send
this
to
as
a
specimen
of
an
australian
boy
s
idea
of
repartee
at
ix
fairacre
march
i
have
just
returned
from
stein
s
laden
with
roses
and
early
white
china
asters
and
double
balsams
of
the
most
celestial
pink
you
know
of
old
what
a
delightful
event
a
visit
to
rosenthal
is
but
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
listen
for
hours
to
professor
kellwitz
the
primitive
dwelling
man
talking
for
hours
on
the
pentateuch
and
die
keilinschriften
and
the
early
twilight
of
man
s
history
on
the
earth
nay
he
one
day
went
back
still
further
even
to
the
time
when
our
world
was
without
form
and
what
is
above
was
not
called
heaven
and
that
which
is
the
earth
beneath
had
not
a
a
sprout
had
yet
sprung
forth
and
the
generative
processes
at
work
were
all
hidden
in
chaotic
vapour
the
two
old
friends
spoke
of
course
to
each
other
in
german
and
sometimes
i
lost
the
thread
of
what
they
were
saying
and
i
would
not
ask
a
question
for
the
world
i
love
too
well
to
listen
to
men
talking
when
they
are
oblivious
of
a
woman
s
presence
the
second
day
i
was
there
is
especially
memorable
to
me
stein
was
busy
preserving
duke
cherries
in
brandy
the
sparrows
are
so
bad
this
year
that
the
cherries
have
been
gathered
off
some
trees
before
ripening
don
t
you
think
the
sparrow
in
australia
is
an
awful
example
of
a
bird
with
a
conscience
seared
as
with
a
hot
iron
in
his
native
countries
he
is
it
seems
undainty
to
a
discreditable
degree
seldom
tasting
fruit
and
never
red
nectar
but
with
us
he
not
only
becomes
an
epicure
beyond
the
wildest
dreams
of
the
pagan
world
but
a
reckless
small
attila
with
a
pair
of
brown
wings
not
merely
does
he
disdain
to
eat
the
skin
of
a
freestone
peach
and
the
transparent
rind
of
sweetwater
grapes
but
for
each
one
he
eats
he
spoils
twenty
by
pecking
at
them
here
at
rosenthal
where
he
lives
and
at
ease
the
ungrateful
little
varlet
nibbles
two
score
of
cherries
to
each
one
he
eats
ah
true
i
have
not
told
you
about
the
second
day
of
my
visit
there
was
rather
a
horrid
gully
wind
blowing
so
early
in
the
afternoon
the
doctor
and
the
professor
established
themselves
in
the
western
veranda
with
the
curtains
drawn
with
their
pipes
lit
and
between
them
a
table
that
groaned
under
its
array
of
bottles
i
was
sitting
with
a
book
and
a
small
rupert
garment
half
made
by
the
french
window
of
the
when
the
two
took
up
their
quarters
close
beside
me
with
only
the
between
us
there
were
peals
of
homeric
laughter
as
they
recalled
incidents
of
their
student
days
and
there
was
talk
of
a
lischen
who
seems
to
have
been
celebrated
for
the
length
of
her
golden
hair
long
since
turned
to
dust
then
they
talked
of
their
work
the
doctor
told
tales
of
the
early
days
of
the
colony
and
how
years
ago
he
and
courtland
became
intimate
friends
when
he
spoke
of
father
s
learning
and
rare
goodness
of
nature
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
myself
from
stepping
out
and
kissing
him
on
the
mouth
then
the
professor
spoke
of
his
early
struggles
for
many
years
he
held
a
subordinate
post
in
a
small
university
where
he
had
of
the
day
to
himself
he
seems
from
the
first
to
have
been
devoted
to
that
kind
of
literature
which
no
reference
library
should
be
without
one
of
the
incidents
he
told
was
of
a
far
journey
he
made
during
one
vacation
to
a
little
town
to
which
some
had
bequeathed
a
singular
collection
of
books
it
was
a
long
journey
and
cost
more
than
he
anticipated
so
that
before
he
returned
he
was
forced
to
leave
his
watch
in
pawn
though
he
trudged
the
greater
part
of
the
way
and
the
object
of
all
this
was
to
authenticate
on
hearing
this
i
shifted
my
chair
so
that
i
could
see
the
professor
s
face
better
a
spare
keen
face
it
is
with
many
lines
and
furrows
and
yet
distinctly
human
as
though
in
all
his
researches
and
wanderings
he
had
never
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
man
himself
is
a
more
insoluble
interesting
problem
than
any
facts
to
be
gleaned
regarding
him
there
was
a
sound
of
and
discovering
that
i
was
thirsty
i
went
into
the
for
a
glass
of
seltzer
when
i
returned
the
talk
had
veered
to
inhabitants
and
resources
and
future
prospects
the
professor
found
a
grave
drawback
in
the
thought
that
as
most
colonists
originally
came
to
the
country
for
material
reasons
true
patriotism
must
be
of
tardy
growth
your
young
people
do
not
love
it
as
their
native
land
in
the
same
way
that
ours
do
yes
herr
professor
they
do
i
cried
obeying
an
irresistible
impulse
to
bear
witness
to
the
love
i
have
for
my
own
country
and
then
a
long
animated
talk
followed
during
which
i
was
obliged
to
turn
to
my
own
the
professor
talks
english
much
better
than
i
talk
german
i
drew
up
the
veranda
curtain
and
bade
the
good
pundit
mark
the
loveliness
of
my
city
with
its
white
buildings
and
scores
of
spires
encircled
by
shady
parks
the
sea
beyond
stretching
to
the
western
horizon
the
fertile
plain
to
the
north
sprinkled
with
wide
fields
that
yield
bountiful
harvests
from
year
to
year
the
hills
close
at
hand
with
their
heights
and
graceful
curves
and
shadowy
thickly
studded
with
prosperous
homes
with
orchards
and
vineyards
and
flowery
gardens
and
over
all
the
overflowing
sunshine
which
encompasses
the
land
year
in
year
out
who
could
be
born
in
such
a
place
and
not
love
it
for
its
beauty
and
fertility
if
our
fathers
were
crowded
out
of
the
old
left
it
because
they
feared
their
children
might
sink
into
not
that
an
added
reason
to
love
the
new
one
which
had
offered
them
comfort
and
prosperity
and
a
fair
field
for
the
energies
of
their
sons
we
have
great
wastes
and
atrocious
hot
shall
we
receive
good
and
not
evil
also
yes
after
all
each
one
must
remain
in
his
own
skin
said
stein
taking
up
the
parable
if
i
were
in
bitter
poverty
in
the
fatherland
as
many
men
are
who
are
more
gifted
than
i
am
i
might
be
a
dangerous
socialist
hatching
plots
against
the
safety
of
the
state
there
is
a
point
beyond
which
history
and
the
traditions
of
the
past
touch
the
heart
but
little
the
great
kings
and
nobles
who
figure
so
largely
in
our
history
were
mostly
men
who
commanded
the
lives
and
wages
of
others
while
they
themselves
were
hedged
round
with
privileges
and
wanton
luxury
i
want
my
own
share
of
the
pleasant
things
of
life
and
the
country
which
gives
me
this
and
in
which
my
children
were
born
has
as
strong
a
claim
on
their
love
and
gratitude
as
the
oldest
country
of
them
all
practically
you
owe
your
life
to
the
country
in
which
you
were
born
stella
here
who
is
the
granddaughter
of
a
man
that
fell
fighting
for
old
england
do
you
think
she
would
not
make
as
much
sacrifice
for
her
native
land
as
any
german
maiden
of
old
times
hear
hear
said
i
clapping
my
hands
in
honour
of
myself
in
true
democratic
fashion
enter
stein
followed
by
hetty
with
a
trayful
of
slender
pink
glasses
and
a
flagon
of
rosenthal
cup
the
pure
juice
of
the
australian
grape
mellowed
by
ten
years
repose
in
the
doctor
s
cellar
it
was
a
lovely
amber
colour
with
an
excellent
bouquet
and
though
i
always
like
wine
best
when
i
do
not
drink
it
i
felt
bound
to
honour
the
professor
s
toast
which
was
the
old
fatherland
and
the
new
we
became
great
friends
and
in
fact
i
have
promised
that
when
you
and
i
go
on
our
travels
we
shall
pay
him
a
visit
in
x
fairacre
march
my
dear
cuthbert
a
very
disconcerting
thought
hopped
into
my
head
after
reading
over
your
last
letter
you
seem
to
go
to
see
the
rev
carter
very
often
tell
me
it
the
quality
of
the
good
man
s
theology
or
his
daughters
that
attract
you
perhaps
you
have
not
yet
arrived
at
the
conscious
stage
oh
yes
i
am
quite
an
authority
on
the
tender
passion
i
have
read
and
harrison
s
play
and
made
endless
suggestions
there
are
two
young
people
who
are
madly
in
love
with
each
other
but
do
not
know
it
till
a
certain
crisis
i
object
to
this
rather
but
says
that
it
is
for
the
stage
and
not
for
posterity
you
would
have
laughed
if
you
had
heard
us
deciding
such
knotty
points
as
to
whether
a
certain
young
man
would
have
the
presence
of
mind
to
improvise
a
story
when
he
was
interrupted
in
making
a
declaration
of
love
whether
the
heroine
was
not
disloyal
in
believing
her
lover
guilty
of
a
crime
because
appearances
were
strongly
against
him
etc
there
is
an
unusual
and
interesting
plot
and
the
dialogue
is
crisp
calls
it
macaroni
for
the
present
because
he
says
i
have
been
sticking
feathers
in
it
i
found
him
out
using
up
some
things
i
said
and
he
declares
it
is
because
evelina
resembles
me
and
would
naturally
speak
a
little
like
me
i
have
now
a
very
nice
from
zembra
s
named
ivan
our
favourite
ride
is
to
the
seaside
which
we
reach
in
half
an
hour
when
we
make
for
the
grange
or
henley
beach
the
latter
is
my
favourite
ride
we
pass
such
gardens
and
hedges
still
full
of
macartney
a
flat
shadowy
tract
in
which
there
are
always
wheeling
slowly
above
the
white
terns
and
occasionally
those
lovely
little
gulls
and
pale
gray
with
feet
and
bills
when
disturbed
by
the
trampling
of
our
horses
they
utter
mournful
cries
and
fly
before
us
seaward
they
remind
me
of
something
in
an
old
author
somewhere
on
the
shelves
about
thee
gathered
the
daughters
of
old
ocean
uttering
cries
of
grief
they
spread
over
thee
vestments
perfumed
with
ambrosia
but
i
have
been
strangely
neglectful
in
not
introducing
you
before
this
to
major
foster
and
paul
ferrier
though
we
have
known
them
only
since
you
left
they
are
now
habitual
fact
they
may
be
called
our
de
la
in
the
antique
line
the
cause
of
the
major
s
visit
to
adelaide
is
a
great
joke
he
came
to
administer
consolation
to
an
old
friend
who
had
lost
his
wife
and
was
nine
months
do
you
not
find
this
very
funny
but
when
i
tell
you
that
this
friend
is
inglis
taylor
during
the
first
six
months
of
his
widowhood
mr
wrote
repeatedly
to
his
old
friend
urging
him
to
come
on
a
visit
he
was
so
but
could
not
leave
his
clients
to
go
for
a
change
but
the
major
being
long
a
widower
with
his
only
daughter
settled
and
having
retired
from
the
army
why
should
he
not
come
so
moved
by
the
sacred
ties
of
old
friendship
and
the
duty
of
administering
consolation
the
major
came
and
found
his
friend
enjoying
the
sober
ecstasies
of
his
third
honeymoon
you
know
already
something
of
mrs
taylor
and
her
many
matrimonial
adventures
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
on
the
voyage
the
major
read
standard
works
of
philosophy
and
religion
so
that
he
might
be
better
able
to
bind
up
a
prostrate
and
bleeding
spirit
i
have
tried
to
glean
information
on
this
point
but
the
major
is
reticent
in
fact
i
think
he
mistrusts
my
motives
he
does
not
know
that
my
curiosity
arises
from
my
wish
to
be
a
beautiful
soul
don
t
you
remember
that
montaigne
says
the
beautiful
souls
are
they
that
are
universal
open
and
ready
for
all
things
if
not
instructed
at
least
capable
of
being
so
now
i
do
want
to
be
instructed
how
a
man
feels
when
he
has
come
fifteen
thousand
miles
to
weep
on
the
neck
of
a
widower
and
finds
him
married
for
the
third
time
to
a
woman
who
has
been
thrice
married
before
well
perhaps
this
is
only
her
third
husband
but
i
can
not
make
any
other
reduction
in
the
number
i
never
see
her
without
recalling
the
woman
of
samaria
but
i
suppose
it
makes
a
difference
if
there
is
only
one
of
them
living
at
a
mean
of
the
husbands
ferrier
is
an
he
lived
among
the
blacks
for
twenty
years
but
he
has
been
so
much
concerned
for
their
souls
that
he
does
not
know
any
myths
and
their
customs
i
suppose
are
not
to
be
spoken
of
he
called
shortly
after
you
left
to
ask
if
mother
would
subscribe
to
the
mission
in
which
he
was
so
long
engaged
till
severe
and
repeated
ophthalmia
threatened
him
with
blindness
indeed
he
had
almost
lost
his
sight
when
he
came
to
be
treated
in
the
hospital
here
six
months
ago
even
now
when
he
is
outside
he
always
wears
a
green
shade
over
his
eyes
he
has
about
sixty
pounds
a
year
to
live
on
and
out
of
this
he
subscribes
ten
pounds
a
year
to
the
mandura
mission
he
is
nearly
seventy
but
looks
older
being
very
and
brown
and
his
eyes
so
dim
there
is
something
heroic
and
ardent
about
the
old
man
and
imagine
being
so
enthusiastic
about
the
conversion
of
the
aborigines
you
know
mother
s
angelic
kindness
to
poor
and
lonely
people
he
is
quite
alone
in
the
world
and
no
doubt
his
leisure
engrosses
most
of
his
time
it
is
an
understood
thing
that
he
comes
to
fairacre
twice
or
thrice
a
week
and
we
all
subscribe
to
his
beloved
mission
i
think
he
has
more
of
don
quixote
in
him
than
any
other
i
have
ever
known
you
say
that
you
never
think
of
me
now
as
doing
anything
but
making
snares
for
the
grasshoppers
or
watching
birds
on
the
wing
well
we
do
pass
a
great
deal
of
our
time
outside
the
worst
ardours
of
the
summer
are
over
the
woods
are
so
shady
and
the
children
and
the
dogs
tempt
me
out
constantly
when
i
have
serious
thoughts
of
confusedly
tumbling
over
divers
authors
after
breakfast
we
go
out
to
feed
the
pigeons
and
the
chickens
there
are
so
many
pigeons
now
they
darken
the
air
flying
down
to
be
fed
they
alight
on
our
shoulders
and
make
such
pretty
cooing
sounds
it
is
not
to
be
credited
though
how
and
everyday
hector
grows
in
common
with
his
family
time
who
is
the
most
impertinent
busybody
in
the
world
so
soon
spoils
alas
i
suppose
i
ought
to
say
young
women
ivan
begins
to
distinguish
my
voice
and
makes
me
very
happy
sometimes
by
whinnying
when
i
speak
to
him
often
we
follow
a
string
of
ants
to
their
home
and
watch
them
descend
with
the
booty
they
have
gathered
we
drop
crystals
of
sugar
and
grains
of
wheat
and
rice
so
as
to
watch
them
carrying
off
their
loads
in
triumph
this
afternoon
we
discovered
a
hive
of
bees
in
hercules
is
it
necessary
to
explain
that
this
is
the
gigantic
opposite
us
in
the
park
lands
their
hum
is
never
absent
there
but
near
that
great
old
tree
it
is
as
though
one
were
inside
a
hive
we
watched
numbers
passing
in
and
out
of
the
hollow
stump
of
a
broken
limb
high
up
and
looking
closely
we
saw
the
ends
of
their
waxen
cells
how
many
jars
of
honey
are
hived
away
there
is
now
an
in
interest
only
to
the
chrysanthemums
which
are
swelling
visibly
and
promise
to
open
early
this
season
after
discovering
the
wild
hive
we
wandered
homeward
and
when
we
got
back
we
ate
grapes
in
the
vine
arcade
it
is
quite
a
show
literally
bending
beneath
its
loads
of
grapes
so
are
all
the
each
after
its
kind
the
jargonelle
pears
are
as
yellow
and
soft
as
cream
and
the
large
purple
turkish
figs
melt
on
the
trees
the
peaches
and
apricots
blush
at
each
other
like
lovers
in
a
play
mem
offer
this
comparison
to
harrison
for
macaroni
there
are
some
whose
fruit
looks
like
fiery
blossoms
they
are
not
quite
ripe
yet
but
we
got
one
each
and
sat
down
picking
seeds
from
the
crimson
rinds
like
sparrows
now
dustiefoot
it
is
extremely
wrong
of
you
to
thrust
your
cold
black
nose
in
my
my
dear
don
t
you
think
it
is
time
i
stopped
that
is
the
way
with
us
in
our
dear
quiet
adelaide
we
have
so
little
to
distract
us
that
when
we
begin
to
do
anything
the
difficulty
is
to
leave
xi
blumenthal
easter
sunday
i
must
write
to
you
while
i
am
at
pastor
fielder
s
i
came
on
saturday
so
as
to
be
at
the
dankfest
you
know
what
an
charming
little
township
blumenthal
is
with
the
coolie
hills
in
the
distance
to
the
and
the
quiet
shadowy
woods
all
round
broken
up
by
farms
and
vineyards
and
numberless
homesteads
nestling
among
stephan
s
the
new
little
lutheran
church
is
nearly
a
mile
from
the
pastor
s
house
with
a
delicious
untilled
valley
full
of
tan
wattles
lying
between
there
is
a
garden
and
a
glebe
attached
to
the
glebe
with
two
likewise
two
calves
that
come
up
and
let
you
kiss
them
on
the
forehead
and
rub
their
charming
little
chestnut
noses
against
your
hand
there
is
also
a
fat
gray
cob
lazier
even
than
leo
you
may
doubt
this
but
that
is
because
you
do
not
know
hans
as
intimately
as
i
do
but
i
want
you
to
come
to
the
little
church
the
pastor
went
at
ten
fiedler
and
i
half
an
hour
later
and
we
brought
immense
posies
of
chrysanthemums
they
are
out
in
wide
bushes
at
this
moment
there
is
a
great
bowl
of
them
close
beside
me
they
are
in
the
little
hall
in
the
on
the
tiny
lawn
in
the
we
also
brought
some
of
our
best
roses
and
crocuses
how
i
love
the
yellow
crocuses
that
come
up
in
wide
golden
bubbles
so
close
to
the
ground
sunday
was
an
entirely
perfect
day
i
believe
it
was
really
the
first
day
of
autumn
the
sun
was
at
times
half
veiled
with
fleecy
gray
clouds
the
sky
was
not
so
staringly
blue
a
tender
tint
of
gray
had
stolen
into
it
and
there
were
such
gentle
pastoral
sounds
the
distant
tinkling
of
the
bleating
of
sheep
not
far
away
the
lowing
of
a
cow
whose
calf
had
been
weaned
the
high
sweet
carol
of
a
fantail
autumn
leaves
fluttered
in
the
wind
down
from
the
willows
and
but
they
did
not
speak
of
decay
only
of
rest
everything
the
great
foliage
masses
that
bounded
the
horizon
on
every
side
to
the
bees
whose
buzzing
was
faint
as
if
they
were
half
drugged
with
the
ambrosia
of
deep
no
rumble
of
dray
or
waggon
laden
with
wool
or
wheat
or
grapes
or
hay
invaded
the
sabbath
quiet
my
old
friends
the
schulzes
grossvater
and
grossmutter
greeted
me
with
all
their
old
cordiality
their
seat
was
crammed
with
sturdy
young
schulzes
of
the
third
generation
i
should
be
afraid
to
say
how
many
of
the
sept
there
were
in
all
it
was
good
i
was
in
the
church
before
the
service
began
for
i
could
not
have
kept
my
eyes
from
wandering
such
lavish
heaps
of
flowers
fruit
and
vegetables
no
wonder
the
good
germans
of
blumenthal
hold
a
harvest
festival
there
are
ten
windows
in
stephan
s
with
wide
deep
sills
to
them
on
each
side
of
these
an
overflowing
horn
of
plenty
had
been
emptied
it
was
a
triumphant
exhibition
of
what
nature
can
do
in
our
land
when
her
lap
is
shaken
out
the
apples
alone
were
a
feast
to
the
large
and
smooth
and
beautifully
tinted
as
for
the
pears
they
were
so
ripely
yellow
one
dared
not
look
at
them
too
fixedly
lest
they
should
melt
at
a
glance
there
were
mounds
of
great
purple
figs
gaping
with
mellowness
citrons
large
as
pumpkins
quinces
not
much
smaller
plums
of
all
kinds
from
the
little
piquant
damson
to
the
generous
orleans
mulberries
fragrant
peaches
with
their
crimsoned
cheeks
nectarines
and
oranges
of
a
lordly
size
though
still
of
course
unripe
on
the
plain
table
with
a
white
cloth
and
grapes
heaped
up
in
splendid
profusion
the
robust
black
prince
the
small
berries
of
the
cabernet
i
must
not
put
you
out
of
patience
by
naming
all
besides
if
i
did
half
would
still
be
forgotten
if
you
will
pardon
the
bull
i
noticed
one
bunch
of
doradillas
which
must
have
weighed
five
pounds
you
are
in
deadly
terror
of
hearing
about
the
spies
and
i
spare
you
i
also
let
you
off
in
the
matter
of
vegetables
they
were
all
there
from
the
asparagus
to
the
virtuous
potato
the
ends
of
the
seats
were
wreathed
with
hop
and
vine
leaves
and
round
the
chandeliers
were
hung
sheaves
of
fine
wheat
of
oats
of
barley
and
maize
the
pastor
preached
a
divine
little
simple
and
to
the
point
it
was
the
discourse
of
a
man
who
knows
that
there
are
two
sorts
of
ignorance
and
two
sorts
of
lying
in
the
world
the
ignorance
that
knows
and
cares
for
little
beyond
the
daily
round
the
ignorance
that
cares
for
so
much
yet
apprehends
that
so
little
can
be
really
known
the
of
statements
known
to
be
untrue
the
other
which
takes
the
form
of
treating
as
certainties
matters
that
can
never
be
subjectively
proved
true
and
yet
because
he
knew
all
this
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
all
the
better
fitted
to
speak
with
authority
on
what
we
do
know
to
be
true
we
know
that
if
we
put
aside
the
baser
temptations
of
life
we
can
bear
our
share
of
fruit
to
nourish
man
s
spiritual
nature
even
as
the
fields
around
us
year
in
year
out
bear
harvests
that
sustain
material
life
as
we
came
home
the
wattlewood
valley
rang
with
the
peculiar
mournful
pipe
of
some
birds
they
are
quite
new
here
said
the
pastor
and
pastorin
as
we
stood
to
listen
i
felt
i
ought
to
know
whose
notes
they
were
yet
could
not
tell
without
seeing
the
birds
that
uttered
them
i
left
dustiefoot
in
the
pastor
s
charge
and
stole
away
as
noiselessly
as
an
aboriginal
in
kooditcha
shoes
dear
how
you
will
begin
to
hate
this
me
it
still
has
something
of
the
freshness
of
primeval
woods
they
were
choughs
i
saw
three
of
them
perched
in
the
very
top
of
a
tree
one
knows
them
from
afar
by
their
scarlet
irides
and
the
glossy
green
reflections
of
their
plumage
in
the
afternoon
we
drove
to
the
schulzes
grossmutter
as
usual
kissed
me
repeatedly
as
if
i
were
a
little
very
good
but
it
is
true
if
ever
i
am
good
at
all
it
is
among
these
kindly
sincere
german
people
not
even
the
sort
of
impertinent
pen
you
wot
of
would
tempt
me
to
cast
reflections
now
on
a
world
that
produces
such
fine
grapes
and
people
grossvater
was
in
one
of
his
blithest
and
serenest
hours
their
golden
is
next
his
birthday
after
that
he
will
give
up
all
active
part
in
the
management
of
his
vineyards
his
son
karl
is
a
good
and
skilful
vigneron
i
counsel
him
to
be
true
to
his
australian
make
nothing
but
good
wine
from
good
grapes
said
the
old
man
with
the
genial
smile
that
makes
his
face
so
young
wine
fit
to
drink
at
the
table
of
the
lord
s
supper
at
the
marriage
feast
at
the
christening
of
the
eldest
son
on
the
when
the
dear
god
calls
us
to
another
world
one
sees
how
much
better
it
is
for
the
pastor
to
be
in
the
country
with
a
congregation
that
grows
grapes
and
tills
the
soil
life
passes
with
such
leisurely
tranquillity
and
the
baser
denominations
of
our
kind
seem
more
unreal
i
feel
sure
too
that
no
one
here
tempts
him
to
read
the
kritik
of
pure
reason
fairacre
i
left
blumenthal
yesterday
vowing
to
make
a
longer
visit
in
the
spring
i
carried
away
with
me
from
the
pastor
an
old
ballad
in
early
german
called
two
king
s
children
which
i
am
translating
into
english
for
your
special
benefit
this
is
the
anniversary
of
esther
s
no
one
had
the
courage
to
say
a
word
about
it
after
what
you
said
so
admirably
as
to
the
necessity
of
sometimes
showing
a
little
of
the
sympathy
that
one
feels
i
made
an
effort
but
heavens
how
i
blundered
it
was
after
sunset
i
sat
in
the
sewing
when
esther
came
and
sat
in
a
far
corner
already
dusky
with
the
gathering
twilight
she
sat
with
folded
hands
her
face
pale
and
set
at
last
i
crept
up
to
her
and
touched
her
cheek
with
my
hand
and
presently
we
were
both
crying
to
make
one
weep
bitterly
who
had
before
been
calm
is
that
shedding
any
of
the
balm
of
consolation
don
t
you
think
you
had
better
dissuade
rather
than
encourage
me
in
such
painful
bungling
it
is
better
to
recognise
one
s
limitations
if
people
are
badly
hurt
i
can
make
them
cry
worse
but
can
never
tell
them
it
is
all
for
the
best
i
could
tell
them
that
no
one
understands
the
refinements
of
hangmanship
like
nature
and
that
life
is
a
finished
artist
in
defeating
the
heart
s
insatiable
yearning
for
happiness
but
on
the
whole
i
think
i
had
better
hold
my
my
pen
but
not
till
i
tell
you
a
little
à
related
to
me
by
the
pastor
when
he
drove
me
into
gawler
for
the
two
o
clock
train
two
sundays
ago
he
visited
the
little
lutheran
at
detmold
and
found
the
very
stout
man
who
likes
to
arrange
things
in
a
tranquil
unexciting
a
class
around
him
repeating
the
creed
the
plan
was
that
each
child
should
say
a
clause
thus
i
believe
in
the
holy
catholic
church
next
child
the
communion
of
saints
next
the
forgiveness
of
sins
then
there
was
a
long
pause
till
a
small
boy
at
the
of
the
class
piped
out
please
teacher
the
girl
who
believes
in
the
resurrection
of
the
body
has
got
the
mumps
xii
fairacre
april
alas
the
young
gentle
autumn
was
a
treacherous
for
the
last
week
we
have
had
an
inordinate
fit
of
hot
the
sky
overcast
and
lowering
it
promises
to
rain
but
the
clouds
turn
to
vapour
the
wind
changes
but
it
is
not
cool
again
the
barometer
has
fallen
the
moon
and
the
stars
are
all
hidden
the
air
is
intolerably
sultry
and
there
is
that
further
sign
of
swarms
of
insect
life
i
write
by
my
open
window
and
they
come
floating
in
hovering
round
the
lamp
creeping
on
the
table
getting
in
the
way
of
my
on
foot
and
on
that
fly
one
moment
and
fall
down
helplessly
the
that
crawl
with
wings
and
things
that
fly
as
if
with
legs
they
terrify
purposeless
hordes
that
struggle
into
existence
one
moment
and
the
next
are
crushed
by
a
footfall
the
accidental
turning
of
a
leaf
the
scratch
of
an
idle
pen
do
they
not
throw
some
light
on
the
cataclysms
of
human
history
are
they
not
linked
closely
to
our
race
and
of
an
incomprehensible
world
in
which
stronger
than
righteousness
or
justice
or
any
figment
of
morality
reigns
the
impulse
of
every
single
organic
being
to
increase
in
numbers
is
it
true
that
some
form
of
thought
underlies
the
lowliest
manifestations
of
life
what
instinct
or
purpose
is
subserved
by
those
pretty
little
moths
with
silver
dust
on
their
wings
who
dash
into
the
flame
of
lamp
or
candle
as
if
it
were
the
source
of
life
here
is
one
of
them
which
i
have
twice
saved
from
consuming
itself
one
wing
is
scorched
and
it
is
very
limp
as
if
rescuing
it
from
burning
were
defeating
its
only
purpose
snatching
it
from
the
one
possible
joy
of
existence
the
thought
possesses
me
that
some
higher
intelligences
than
we
know
may
thus
regard
our
lives
but
have
we
more
power
to
fashion
and
to
mould
them
than
this
helpless
thinglet
that
was
called
into
being
by
forces
over
which
it
wields
no
control
and
seeks
nothingness
by
an
impulse
equally
beyond
its
influence
last
night
the
rain
came
down
in
torrents
towards
morning
there
was
a
thunderstorm
of
which
i
heard
nothing
but
the
air
and
the
sky
are
clear
and
fresh
the
torrens
is
babbling
and
the
birds
are
singing
the
blithest
legends
imaginable
all
over
the
park
lands
the
major
and
ferrier
are
spending
the
day
with
us
poor
ferrier
is
forever
telling
us
about
the
conversion
of
some
aborigine
i
often
wish
we
could
keep
an
old
black
fellow
on
hand
at
fairacre
for
him
to
convert
from
time
to
time
and
then
perhaps
he
would
spare
us
these
endless
recitals
but
my
heart
smites
me
for
speaking
like
this
of
the
zealous
and
i
am
sure
mother
likes
to
listen
to
him
then
he
is
so
entirely
in
earnest
perhaps
you
would
like
to
know
his
story
of
it
was
about
a
boy
who
after
being
at
the
mandurang
mission
station
for
a
year
began
to
show
signs
of
repentance
and
grace
one
day
he
stole
some
sugar
was
that
after
he
showed
these
signs
asked
the
major
from
some
people
the
inquiry
would
sound
ironical
but
not
from
the
dear
guileless
major
who
is
evidently
quite
unused
to
theological
phrases
and
was
merely
trying
hard
to
comprehend
all
he
heard
yes
sir
answered
ferrier
it
was
some
weeks
after
we
had
great
hopes
of
him
the
old
adam
is
strong
in
all
of
us
but
perhaps
especially
so
in
our
poor
natives
do
you
know
my
dear
sir
that
there
was
a
canon
law
of
the
church
in
the
early
ages
which
rendered
converts
from
heathenism
ineligible
for
the
priesthood
to
the
second
and
third
generation
well
i
knew
always
gave
our
people
christian
names
at
their
taken
the
sugar
but
i
said
nothing
to
him
i
felt
the
time
had
come
when
he
must
be
allowed
to
stand
or
fall
the
boy
was
dear
to
my
wife
and
she
wished
me
to
take
him
aside
and
remonstrate
with
him
but
i
said
he
knows
good
from
evil
now
we
must
see
whether
the
root
of
the
matter
is
in
we
read
the
word
of
god
and
had
prayers
in
the
evening
as
usual
my
dear
wife
offered
the
prayer
she
wrestled
with
god
mightily
for
the
soul
of
the
boy
ah
my
dear
friends
i
wish
you
had
known
a
thought
for
self
her
only
thought
was
to
win
souls
for
the
saviour
and
many
of
these
poor
people
were
verily
brought
through
her
means
to
the
foot
of
the
cross
it
was
only
nine
months
after
this
it
pleased
god
to
take
her
from
me
there
was
such
pathos
in
the
old
man
s
voice
it
gave
one
a
lump
in
the
throat
the
major
hastily
drew
out
his
handkerchief
and
pretended
to
cough
but
dorothy
at
four
and
a
half
can
much
better
than
the
major
at
mr
ferrier
went
on
to
tell
how
after
the
natives
retired
for
the
night
he
sat
in
the
writing
out
his
monthly
report
leaving
a
blank
where
he
was
to
write
of
thomas
till
he
found
whether
he
would
repent
him
of
his
theft
his
wife
sat
with
a
book
in
her
hand
but
he
knew
that
she
was
crying
not
reading
at
last
a
tap
came
at
the
open
window
and
a
timid
voice
saying
missie
missie
me
want
to
gabber
it
was
thomas
the
wife
at
once
went
out
and
the
boy
talked
to
her
for
some
time
presently
she
came
in
with
a
light
on
her
face
as
ferrier
expressed
it
and
she
said
paul
you
need
not
leave
a
blank
for
thomas
now
the
lord
has
given
him
to
us
as
a
prey
snatched
from
the
snarer
and
though
he
had
a
passionate
temper
and
sometimes
gave
way
to
it
yet
from
that
day
till
the
hour
of
his
death
i
never
had
reason
to
doubt
that
he
was
a
chosen
vessel
of
grace
said
ferrier
solemnly
no
one
could
doubt
the
good
man
s
sincerity
but
i
confess
i
never
hear
him
talk
in
this
fashion
without
a
great
longing
to
know
what
conception
an
australian
aborigine
could
really
form
of
the
profoundly
metaphysical
dogmas
of
christianity
they
are
so
kneaded
into
our
literature
so
imbedded
in
the
marrow
of
our
minds
by
inheritance
and
instruction
we
could
not
if
we
would
really
cast
them
from
us
at
least
as
phases
of
thought
but
a
savage
who
can
not
count
beyond
three
and
goes
out
to
murder
some
tribal
foe
because
a
kinsman
has
been
killed
by
the
fall
of
a
idea
looms
up
in
the
twilight
of
his
mind
when
he
is
kept
at
a
mission
and
taught
the
creed
and
the
ten
commandments
here
is
an
anecdote
i
fished
from
ferrier
when
i
was
trying
to
glean
aboriginal
myths
from
him
an
old
man
badly
wounded
came
to
the
mission
one
day
they
nursed
him
and
fed
him
and
he
seemed
so
docile
and
to
accept
all
he
was
taught
so
readily
that
they
thought
he
was
in
a
short
time
ready
for
baptism
one
thing
puzzled
them
however
though
he
bathed
often
and
had
clean
clothing
on
a
peculiar
odour
always
hung
about
him
a
few
days
before
he
was
to
be
baptized
it
suddenly
struck
ferrier
that
this
was
caused
by
something
with
which
he
smeared
his
hair
but
this
was
not
the
case
it
was
the
of
an
enemy
rolled
up
and
secured
among
his
locks
he
would
allow
no
one
to
touch
or
remove
it
for
it
was
a
point
of
honour
with
him
to
keep
this
ghastly
memento
until
he
had
also
murdered
the
brother
of
his
victim
in
the
meantime
he
was
very
anxious
to
be
baptized
the
rain
has
rather
battered
some
of
our
chrysanthemum
bushes
but
then
there
are
such
angelic
all
and
pink
and
rose
red
are
our
special
favourites
among
the
japanese
this
last
shade
has
for
me
as
irresistible
a
charm
as
the
pink
ear
of
the
maiden
which
in
tom
s
turkish
song
robbed
her
lover
of
his
xiii
fairacre
april
after
listening
to
innumerable
tales
of
conversion
after
hearing
of
aborigines
who
talked
on
their
deathbeds
like
leaflet
tracts
ever
since
we
first
knew
ferrier
he
has
at
last
told
me
a
charming
little
myth
it
bears
no
traces
at
all
of
being
the
production
of
natives
that
to
use
stein
s
expression
had
been
tampered
with
by
the
missionaries
you
might
put
everyone
of
them
that
ever
laboured
in
australia
in
rows
and
bribe
them
with
the
promise
of
a
whole
continent
of
blacks
all
ready
to
talk
broken
english
and
wear
store
clothes
on
yet
between
them
the
worthy
missionaries
would
never
produce
anything
with
the
peculiar
cachet
of
an
aboriginal
myth
but
if
i
say
much
more
you
will
vow
that
i
am
enamoured
of
the
is
as
a
master
passion
on
which
people
must
notoriously
be
mistrusted
it
is
such
a
short
myth
dear
after
all
that
i
am
obliged
to
add
to
it
with
a
preface
do
you
notice
how
tom
is
training
me
to
dabble
in
bulls
the
sun
is
a
woman
who
courses
over
the
sky
all
day
keeping
up
enormous
fires
but
at
last
she
uses
up
all
the
wood
she
has
for
that
day
and
she
goes
down
at
night
among
the
dead
they
stand
up
in
double
lines
to
let
her
pass
and
do
her
reverence
she
has
a
lover
among
them
who
gave
her
a
great
red
kangaroo
skin
each
morning
when
she
rises
she
throws
this
over
her
shoulders
another
thing
i
learned
yesterday
is
that
the
good
little
man
s
special
blacks
noticed
the
stars
and
had
names
for
some
the
evening
star
they
called
kyirrie
the
milky
way
kockadooroo
and
there
is
a
cluster
of
stars
visible
in
the
western
sky
during
the
winter
months
that
they
knew
by
the
name
of
amathooroocooroo
which
signifies
claw
of
please
to
reckon
it
henceforth
among
the
classic
constellations
then
floating
in
the
milky
way
is
still
to
be
seen
the
bottom
of
the
ark
of
neppelle
who
transported
himself
in
it
to
heaven
to
escape
the
waters
with
which
another
god
flooded
the
earth
to
drown
his
unfaithful
wives
and
did
you
ever
hear
that
three
of
the
stars
in
the
southern
cross
are
two
aboriginal
helens
and
their
lover
who
escaped
with
them
to
that
far
retreat
from
the
fury
of
the
deserted
husband
the
astronomical
lore
of
our
natives
may
not
have
been
very
at
any
rate
they
knew
which
sex
was
always
causing
mischief
but
there
is
a
sore
i
know
many
of
you
are
now
sincerely
repentant
fairacre
april
you
would
be
very
much
shocked
to
hear
of
stanhope
s
sudden
death
it
took
us
all
dreadfully
by
surprise
it
is
only
seven
days
ago
that
allie
and
i
met
him
and
his
mother
at
sir
edward
ritchie
s
and
then
as
always
he
looked
the
picture
of
health
and
strength
and
overflowing
with
merriment
we
had
great
fun
about
leo
who
really
is
getting
quite
past
any
whipping
i
can
give
him
in
his
wildest
days
he
would
sit
at
the
and
eat
sugar
but
now
he
almost
gets
into
the
instead
of
drawing
it
stanhope
was
particularly
diverted
at
the
trick
i
told
him
leo
has
acquired
of
stopping
short
when
he
sees
any
very
poor
or
persons
making
sure
mother
is
in
the
trap
and
wants
to
speak
to
them
when
you
drive
those
glossy
thoroughbreds
that
are
being
trained
for
you
you
will
wonder
how
you
could
ever
bear
to
sit
behind
leo
he
said
and
laughed
when
i
pretended
not
to
understand
then
he
took
out
a
little
and
said
my
mother
and
i
are
going
to
cape
town
in
november
mind
the
event
must
come
off
before
then
for
it
is
a
pact
between
ritchie
and
myself
that
we
should
see
each
other
go
off
the
hooks
the
next
day
he
was
attacked
with
violent
congestion
of
the
lungs
he
was
ill
barely
five
days
he
was
buried
this
morning
i
write
the
words
but
they
seem
to
convey
no
meaning
i
see
him
strong
and
young
his
eyes
full
of
laughter
turning
over
the
calendar
filled
with
engagements
and
appointments
but
not
a
word
of
this
one
inevitable
assignation
nothing
left
of
all
that
eager
vivid
personality
save
a
poor
clod
of
earth
hurriedly
hidden
out
of
sight
good
god
is
not
this
the
bitterest
insult
that
could
be
devised
for
the
last
scene
of
the
last
act
there
is
a
wonderful
fund
of
unbelief
in
the
heart
regarding
death
yes
we
must
all
die
but
individually
it
is
as
though
immortality
were
a
birthright
we
are
to
inherit
without
tasting
the
bitterness
of
dissolution
is
it
very
bitter
and
in
the
hereafter
does
it
indeed
matter
very
much
if
we
pass
away
with
empty
lamps
in
that
supreme
moment
when
the
soul
is
sundered
from
the
body
do
we
perceive
that
the
life
which
was
all
in
all
to
us
was
but
a
dream
grafted
upon
a
passing
vision
crowded
with
phantoms
and
now
the
curtain
is
drawn
we
see
no
more
all
beyond
is
so
shadowy
and
faltering
how
is
it
the
thought
of
death
does
not
haunt
us
more
the
event
is
so
tremendous
i
have
often
had
the
feeling
after
the
death
of
one
i
knew
that
never
again
could
i
be
lulled
into
such
entire
forgetfulness
of
this
one
absolute
certainty
but
gradually
the
impression
vanishes
we
are
planted
so
deeply
in
the
life
that
now
may
be
shaken
and
horrified
and
the
world
is
like
one
of
those
which
may
be
turned
inside
out
and
the
exterior
surface
will
then
digest
and
the
stomach
fairacre
may
fanny
harrison
has
returned
from
her
melbourne
visit
and
has
been
telling
us
tales
about
your
overworking
sick
people
day
and
to
incurables
and
blind
people
by
the
superhuman
efforts
to
save
larrikins
from
themselves
don
t
dear
darling
at
any
rate
not
so
much
it
gave
me
a
shiver
all
down
the
vertebræ
when
i
thought
what
if
cuthbert
should
turn
out
one
of
those
clergymen
who
take
life
so
seriously
that
they
die
of
it
like
a
dose
of
arsenic
do
not
forget
that
it
was
a
neglected
cold
when
he
was
so
much
engrossed
with
the
sick
and
poor
one
hard
winter
that
brought
on
the
lung
complaint
of
which
father
died
i
can
not
get
over
a
certain
awkwardness
of
not
knowing
exactly
what
to
say
when
i
first
visit
people
who
are
very
poor
and
hopelessly
ill
so
i
mostly
listen
to
them
and
read
a
little
only
if
they
wish
it
poor
thomson
seems
to
like
this
for
the
last
time
i
visited
him
he
aired
his
grievances
people
are
very
kind
he
said
and
lots
of
ladies
always
visit
him
but
they
do
read
so
much
to
him
no
doubt
tis
very
good
of
them
but
when
a
chap
lies
in
bed
month
after
month
never
expectin
to
get
up
again
in
health
and
often
cussing
himself
for
having
been
a
fool
and
partly
to
blame
for
his
then
a
lump
out
o
the
bible
don
t
seem
to
hearten
him
up
much
now
there
s
cannister
and
meadows
and
her
tis
my
belief
as
they
uses
bibles
not
properly
divided
into
chapters
in
course
there
s
a
good
deal
of
it
taken
up
with
jew
names
and
stories
not
meant
for
gineral
use
but
i
don
t
see
why
them
ladies
should
pick
out
the
melanchorliest
psalmses
for
me
well
i
mean
them
as
is
all
about
the
horrors
of
death
bein
on
me
and
the
waters
goin
over
me
and
my
eyes
bein
consumed
from
weeping
and
bein
a
worm
and
no
man
and
the
arrers
sticking
fast
in
me
and
bein
in
a
pit
and
in
a
dry
thirsty
land
and
arskin
the
lord
why
he
cast
me
off
for
iver
and
that
i
forgit
to
eat
my
bread
bein
like
a
howl
in
the
desert
and
a
perlican
in
the
wilderness
and
a
sparrer
atop
o
the
house
without
a
mate
which
is
what
niver
happens
as
far
as
i
know
the
varmin
and
coals
of
juniper
and
scattered
at
the
grave
s
mouth
and
lying
in
wait
for
my
soul
yes
miss
stella
ye
may
laugh
but
it
s
creepingest
things
yes
i
remember
what
s
read
to
me
pretty
well
but
then
i
ve
heerd
it
all
over
and
over
days
twicet
over
and
then
sits
there
as
you
may
be
now
only
more
frontin
me
so
that
she
can
fix
her
eyes
onto
she
reg
lar
ivery
week
says
to
me
now
my
good
man
there
s
anything
i
hates
it
s
them
words
if
she
said
my
wastin
away
toad
i
d
like
it
now
my
good
man
do
you
not
begin
to
feel
that
it
s
all
well
and
all
for
the
best
in
the
hands
of
the
lord
and
if
i
m
tired
i
just
mostly
gives
a
nod
so
as
she
may
stop
jawing
but
other
times
i
says
i
donno
as
to
things
being
so
very
well
if
my
family
was
pervided
for
an
i
didn
t
lie
awake
half
the
night
coughin
and
spittin
i
might
be
more
sartin
on
the
point
as
to
things
bein
in
the
hands
of
the
lord
i
know
well
if
i
d
have
been
stiddier
and
in
many
ways
i
wouldn
t
be
in
the
fix
i
m
in
when
i
says
anythin
like
that
the
old
dame
looks
for
a
more
dismaller
psalm
the
next
time
it
licks
me
though
how
people
can
go
on
saying
it
s
all
in
the
hands
of
the
almighty
and
he
does
everything
for
the
best
now
miss
stella
if
you
take
it
that
a
good
many
of
the
chaps
i
ve
the
handiwork
of
the
lord
i
d
like
to
know
who
has
spiled
more
horns
nor
he
before
making
a
good
spoon
you
may
not
think
very
highly
of
this
man
s
theology
but
i
like
him
for
his
honesty
in
admitting
that
he
is
to
blame
for
what
he
calls
the
fix
he
is
in
and
a
straighter
way
of
looking
at
things
than
people
generally
allow
fairacre
may
the
fortuniana
and
and
the
heliotrope
and
various
other
flowers
still
flourish
in
our
garden
in
golden
abundance
i
brought
a
great
posy
to
frau
kettig
this
afternoon
with
various
other
things
of
a
more
material
kind
but
the
flowers
delighted
her
most
yes
i
have
just
returned
from
seeing
her
how
angelically
good
and
uncomplaining
she
is
all
through
her
illness
she
is
more
grateful
for
being
destitute
than
i
am
for
all
i
possess
i
assure
you
dear
i
threw
stones
at
myself
nearly
all
the
way
home
i
talked
with
the
dear
old
woman
for
a
long
time
and
read
her
favourite
hymn
to
her
ein
feste
burg
ist
unser
gott
then
she
chanted
the
two
first
thin
old
hands
devoutly
clasped
her
eyes
half
closed
through
the
little
window
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
i
could
see
the
sky
clear
blue
and
serene
like
a
great
heavenly
web
woven
throughout
of
hope
and
love
surely
it
must
be
so
i
thought
looking
at
the
frail
old
woman
with
her
load
of
eighty
all
her
cruel
bereavements
and
losses
and
now
in
her
diseased
old
age
after
moiling
like
a
slave
for
years
dependent
on
charity
for
her
bread
yet
lifting
up
her
trembling
aged
voice
and
hands
in
tearful
love
and
gratitude
to
great
father
in
whose
hands
are
a
thousand
worlds
full
of
yet
has
bereft
this
sincere
loving
soul
of
all
if
there
were
not
some
tremendous
force
of
love
behind
the
mocks
of
this
world
could
spirit
achieve
so
signal
a
triumph
over
matter
it
is
a
fair
summer
day
of
the
lord
full
of
his
sunshine
and
yet
cool
and
the
flowers
thou
hast
brought
me
beloved
child
take
me
back
to
the
sweet
thuringian
woods
she
said
with
the
simple
directness
which
makes
the
grand
old
german
sound
like
one
s
i
could
not
trust
myself
to
speak
after
a
little
she
said
as
if
suspecting
that
i
was
too
sorry
for
her
when
one
no
longer
hopes
to
rise
again
how
good
and
dear
it
is
to
think
on
the
day
when
all
waiting
and
weariness
are
forgotten
in
beholding
the
face
of
the
beloved
redeemer
here
is
fatima
at
my
elbow
rubbing
herself
against
me
and
purring
benevolently
looking
a
little
askance
at
dustiefoot
who
has
indeed
too
often
tried
to
make
a
plaything
of
her
tail
but
he
is
fast
asleep
just
now
with
his
nose
against
my
shoe
fatima
likes
those
lucid
intervals
in
which
dustiefoot
slumbers
and
she
can
purr
of
auld
langsyne
without
interruption
dear
old
tabby
tell
me
quick
and
tell
me
true
is
your
ardent
liking
for
fish
a
proof
that
in
another
world
you
will
sail
a
boat
and
cast
a
net
into
the
sea
certainly
though
you
love
fish
even
to
felony
you
can
not
go
in
the
life
that
now
things
are
a
parable
i
begin
to
see
that
this
infatuated
pen
of
mine
will
get
me
into
trouble
if
i
do
not
xiv
fairacre
may
we
do
not
think
mother
is
as
strong
as
usual
but
as
neither
the
seaside
nor
the
hills
suit
her
as
well
as
fairacre
we
do
not
like
to
venture
on
a
change
to
either
she
will
however
most
probably
accompany
esther
to
coonjooree
for
some
months
allie
has
gone
for
a
couple
of
weeks
to
the
emberlys
and
i
do
most
of
mother
s
for
her
she
consents
to
this
more
readily
because
i
think
she
believes
it
is
good
for
me
but
personally
i
can
not
help
feeling
how
much
better
it
would
be
to
send
kirsty
instead
of
me
she
thoroughly
believes
that
under
all
circumstances
people
are
better
off
than
they
deserve
if
a
man
has
broken
his
leg
she
is
ready
to
say
what
a
blessing
it
is
not
his
neck
if
a
poor
woman
is
confined
of
her
tenth
baby
kirsty
reflects
how
much
better
than
to
have
typhoid
fever
and
when
people
have
typhoid
fever
she
says
what
a
mercy
it
is
from
the
lord
to
have
medical
attendance
i
confided
to
mother
the
other
day
how
in
average
i
am
haunted
by
the
feeling
that
i
can
do
no
good
and
sit
with
a
long
face
thinking
how
horrid
it
is
to
be
in
bed
and
wondering
awkwardly
what
i
am
to
say
next
then
the
flies
put
me
out
of
countenance
with
the
poorer
people
among
us
they
are
a
veritable
their
bedchambers
and
upon
their
beds
and
in
their
ovens
and
in
their
mother
answered
very
gently
charity
my
dear
is
a
kind
of
bezer
in
the
wilderness
a
city
of
refuge
which
we
must
always
keep
open
because
of
the
many
accidents
and
misfortunes
of
life
our
visitings
and
readings
and
spent
by
lonely
they
may
perhaps
be
compared
to
the
refuge
refuge
written
in
every
double
way
on
the
parting
of
the
ways
to
aid
those
who
without
help
or
sympathy
might
be
in
danger
of
perishing
in
the
great
desert
think
my
dear
what
it
is
to
lie
for
month
after
month
in
a
poor
little
room
without
ever
hoping
to
be
well
again
even
to
make
hours
a
little
pleasanter
that
would
otherwise
be
dark
and
lonely
is
something
in
such
matters
we
must
be
content
to
live
from
hand
to
mouth
without
looking
for
great
results
you
know
how
mother
s
words
delicate
as
honey
born
in
air
at
once
soothe
and
convince
the
heart
yesterday
the
major
told
us
about
one
of
his
funny
episodes
with
adolphe
that
is
his
austrian
by
birth
but
with
a
cosmopolitan
command
of
tongues
the
major
and
he
bid
each
other
an
eternal
farewell
every
three
months
if
not
oftener
adolphe
went
yesterday
morning
to
send
a
telegram
for
his
master
and
did
not
return
till
late
in
the
afternoon
very
much
the
worse
for
liquor
which
he
often
takes
beyond
the
bounds
of
moderation
as
he
candidly
explains
pour
la
guérison
de
doleur
he
always
knows
when
he
has
taken
too
much
and
his
custom
is
to
come
to
the
major
with
a
virtuously
determined
air
and
say
sir
it
is
wrong
that
i
should
longer
anguish
the
heart
of
a
true
and
loving
woman
i
must
return
to
my
yet
to
leave
then
he
breaks
down
often
as
this
little
farce
has
been
acted
with
variations
it
always
seems
to
rouse
the
major
s
ire
and
then
make
him
relent
all
in
one
scene
if
only
his
conscience
could
be
touched
murmured
ferrier
would
the
major
allow
him
to
give
adolphe
some
little
books
on
the
evils
of
alcohol
certainly
but
the
major
thought
it
was
only
fair
to
tell
ferrier
that
adolphe
was
always
ready
to
sign
a
pledge
against
intoxicants
but
when
he
is
tipsy
next
day
he
explains
with
great
fluency
how
the
necessity
for
nervine
aliment
is
insurmountable
in
a
climate
like
this
no
i
am
not
going
to
laurette
at
as
early
a
date
as
was
fixed
because
it
is
now
quite
evident
that
mother
is
out
of
health
i
can
not
go
until
she
is
better
stein
is
in
attendance
and
i
am
head
nurse
allie
kirsty
stein
tells
me
that
our
friend
professor
kellwitz
contemplates
and
for
the
first
time
to
a
lady
who
has
been
his
intimate
friend
for
over
twenty
years
is
it
not
dreadful
to
spoil
so
tried
a
friendship
in
this
ruthless
way
xv
fairacre
june
poor
dear
ferrier
has
had
a
severe
disappointment
with
adolphe
who
under
the
s
unwearied
efforts
became
not
only
a
total
abstainer
but
to
some
extent
a
lecturer
he
devoutly
read
ferrier
s
good
little
temperance
learnt
much
of
them
by
heart
so
that
when
it
occurred
to
some
zealous
teetotalers
to
put
him
on
the
platform
adolphe
became
at
once
very
popular
and
was
always
greeted
with
cheers
no
doubt
like
jourdain
s
who
hungered
after
peu
de
adolphe
found
that
me
last
tuesday
he
went
with
ferrier
to
address
an
evening
temperance
assemblage
at
a
little
township
four
miles
away
it
seems
that
on
these
occasions
it
is
customary
sometimes
to
make
certain
experiments
with
alcohol
to
show
its
evil
effects
when
it
came
to
adolphe
s
turn
to
address
the
meeting
he
gave
what
ferrier
called
an
able
and
earnest
address
at
a
certain
point
he
broke
an
egg
into
a
glass
and
then
poured
some
brandy
on
it
to
show
what
a
deleterious
effect
it
had
on
the
albumen
the
audience
cheered
lustily
and
were
much
impressed
but
when
the
next
speaker
rose
adolphe
was
seen
to
slip
behind
him
and
swallow
the
experiment
in
a
few
gulps
loud
expressions
of
disapproval
arose
and
adolphe
instantly
came
forward
to
defend
himself
from
the
calumny
it
was
then
apparent
that
he
must
have
been
previously
imbibing
and
in
fact
he
had
taken
a
quarter
of
a
bottle
of
the
major
s
best
brandy
to
make
experiments
which
should
revolt
the
popular
mind
against
nervine
aliment
when
he
returned
home
that
night
he
went
weeping
into
the
major
s
room
imploring
him
not
to
take
any
more
stimulant
of
any
kind
and
holding
himself
up
as
an
example
of
its
evil
all
through
swallowing
a
small
experiment
by
an
unaccountable
error
two
days
ago
i
was
on
a
visit
at
marwood
s
and
went
from
there
to
what
the
profane
called
a
disorganized
charity
meeting
along
with
mabel
towers
we
too
went
as
marwood
s
deputies
but
what
singular
instructions
we
received
here
you
see
girls
is
my
list
said
marwood
producing
two
octavo
sheets
with
various
names
and
figures
etc
you
see
there
s
a
large
committee
of
us
and
we
have
to
be
very
here
are
the
numbers
of
things
to
be
given
opposite
each
applicant
s
name
we
decided
that
at
a
meeting
some
days
ago
sometimes
we
run
short
and
are
obliged
to
give
a
pair
of
trousers
instead
of
a
dress
but
if
any
complaints
are
made
give
them
a
form
to
fill
up
and
send
in
for
we
have
to
be
very
strict
and
accurate
and
if
you
happen
to
give
too
many
things
to
one
person
mind
you
give
nothing
to
the
next
benjamin
ezra
is
to
be
there
and
you
must
keep
an
eye
on
her
that
she
does
not
give
away
my
share
her
plan
is
to
give
heaps
away
till
everything
is
gone
she
either
loses
her
list
or
else
never
looks
at
it
this
is
very
awkward
in
a
society
on
such
strict
business
principles
as
the
organized
relief
yes
so
determined
are
we
to
imitate
all
the
charities
of
the
that
before
this
great
fertile
young
hercules
is
yet
fifty
years
old
we
not
only
provide
relief
works
and
and
free
breakfasts
as
we
did
last
winter
but
this
season
we
have
also
an
organized
relief
society
which
among
other
nefarious
tricks
distributes
clothing
but
my
dear
i
warn
you
do
not
send
any
money
to
the
philanthropic
novelties
of
our
metropolis
they
are
frightfully
mischievous
and
the
really
deserving
poor
do
not
go
near
them
there
is
quite
enough
discriminating
benevolence
everywhere
in
the
country
to
cope
with
all
honest
poverty
it
is
when
we
begin
to
tease
with
salaries
that
impostors
and
the
cunningly
vicious
have
their
innings
and
that
the
unabashed
professional
pauper
appears
in
the
land
we
have
now
not
only
the
weaklings
that
have
been
industriously
sent
us
by
emigration
agents
but
the
greasy
loafers
of
other
provinces
who
are
attracted
to
ours
by
our
notoriously
indiscriminate
distribution
of
alms
let
me
tell
you
of
the
two
first
cases
on
our
list
which
may
i
believe
be
taken
as
average
specimens
of
what
the
rest
were
no
applicant
o
mulligan
with
two
of
destitution
husband
an
long
out
of
employment
large
family
furniture
seized
for
rent
o
mulligan
soon
set
us
to
work
i
can
assure
you
we
were
the
first
to
arrive
and
were
ushered
into
a
room
lined
with
wide
shelves
full
of
clothing
of
all
kinds
a
great
deal
of
it
as
good
as
new
it
was
like
a
clothes
without
the
pathos
fortunately
also
without
the
dirt
o
m
was
down
for
one
woman
s
dress
two
ditto
for
girls
one
man
s
coat
one
ditto
trousers
one
ditto
boots
she
and
the
girls
followed
us
into
the
we
soon
found
dresses
for
them
then
came
the
mother
s
turn
but
as
she
weighed
over
fourteen
stone
it
was
no
light
task
to
fit
her
shure
now
and
you
see
for
yourselves
young
ladies
that
wouldn
t
kape
on
me
little
finger
yes
that
s
a
foine
thick
stuff
but
where
ud
i
be
in
it
the
most
av
it
at
last
she
selected
a
pale
blue
cashmere
not
nearly
as
large
as
some
useful
dresses
she
had
rejected
marwood
said
this
choice
must
have
been
made
with
a
view
to
selling
or
pawning
and
no
doubt
that
was
the
explanation
then
came
the
husband
s
turn
he
must
have
been
phenomenal
in
his
proportions
judging
by
the
yards
of
tape
with
which
o
m
measured
the
upper
parts
of
trousers
we
turned
over
for
her
at
last
came
a
pair
that
looked
as
though
it
must
be
the
gift
of
a
benevolent
elephant
so
this
she
put
aside
then
she
pulled
an
endless
sort
of
string
from
her
pocket
which
turned
out
to
be
the
measure
for
a
pair
of
boots
of
course
there
were
none
of
such
an
impossible
length
it
s
not
thin
that
o
mulligan
has
such
a
large
fut
at
all
at
all
but
he
gets
the
swelled
rheumatzises
so
bad
indade
he
had
an
ilegant
fut
in
his
young
days
but
what
with
the
throubles
and
the
sorrow
they
seems
to
git
larger
ivery
year
as
the
string
was
twenty
inches
long
it
was
evident
some
mistake
was
made
it
was
in
fact
the
lingth
av
little
paddy
s
throusers
after
all
the
articles
for
which
this
woman
was
put
down
had
been
produced
we
politely
asked
her
to
take
them
away
is
it
that
this
is
all
i
m
to
git
she
asked
with
a
tragic
air
we
asked
her
what
else
she
wanted
and
she
said
i
have
six
helpless
childer
and
i
want
a
complate
shuit
for
each
ye
see
thim
two
girrls
wid
me
wan
av
thim
has
a
good
ulster
on
an
that
s
a
lind
the
other
she
has
a
good
pair
av
boots
an
thim
is
a
lind
so
is
the
hat
wid
a
feather
on
top
av
my
head
an
the
gloves
on
me
hands
an
the
mantle
on
me
back
wid
a
bead
collar
she
raised
her
voice
and
she
flourished
her
arms
as
she
spoke
finally
she
took
up
three
pairs
of
boys
trousers
that
were
near
her
and
went
away
saying
she
would
put
us
in
the
papers
for
cruelty
to
an
onfortinate
rispictable
woman
wid
a
husband
that
had
seen
better
days
and
a
large
family
and
no
support
she
turned
back
at
the
door
and
said
ye
have
a
great
roomful
av
things
sint
by
the
charitable
an
ye
sind
me
away
wid
a
few
miserable
rags
for
reasons
best
beknowns
to
yerselves
our
next
case
was
a
small
thin
woman
with
an
extraordinary
facility
for
tears
she
wept
copiously
the
moment
we
spoke
to
her
she
never
had
accepted
charity
before
in
all
her
life
and
it
was
very
hard
to
begin
now
with
this
she
made
a
dart
at
a
heap
of
boys
shirts
that
were
near
her
quite
new
marwood
and
other
wholesale
drapers
having
sent
various
parcels
of
clothing
from
their
warehouses
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
folded
up
three
shirts
she
was
down
on
the
list
as
a
widow
with
one
boy
name
eliza
trimton
and
the
written
oracle
restricted
her
to
two
articles
for
herself
and
three
for
the
boy
i
explained
this
to
her
and
added
that
we
were
bound
to
keep
to
our
list
yes
of
knew
that
and
she
began
to
shed
tears
afresh
and
pounced
on
an
elaborate
that
had
been
sent
by
someone
who
had
more
money
than
wit
next
she
fixed
her
gaze
on
a
very
good
ulster
and
she
instantly
began
to
cry
afresh
no
one
she
said
but
those
that
had
seen
better
days
knew
how
bitter
it
was
to
accept
alms
with
that
she
folded
up
the
ulster
and
put
it
with
the
other
spoils
it
comes
very
hard
to
accept
charity
for
the
first
time
she
murmured
seizing
on
a
blue
cloud
a
boy
s
vest
and
a
pair
of
merino
stockings
all
at
one
swoop
for
the
second
time
i
read
over
to
her
the
articles
to
which
she
was
entitled
and
thought
she
had
taken
the
hint
for
she
began
to
tie
up
her
bundle
but
presently
her
tears
flowed
and
she
picked
up
a
woman
s
hat
a
boy
s
greatcoat
and
a
pair
of
boots
in
rapid
succession
but
really
you
know
this
is
a
great
deal
more
than
your
share
said
mabel
more
than
my
share
retorted
trimton
wiping
her
eyes
vigorously
who
took
it
on
theirselves
to
know
all
i
want
i
never
breathed
it
to
anyone
i
needed
so
much
never
having
accepted
charity
before
my
feelings
was
too
with
that
she
dried
her
eyes
and
went
away
by
this
time
most
of
the
had
arrived
and
one
of
them
said
as
so
many
applicants
were
coming
they
had
better
not
be
admitted
into
the
room
where
the
clothing
was
of
course
that
is
the
proper
plan
said
another
lady
but
there
will
be
a
heap
of
letters
in
the
papers
saying
the
public
gave
so
generously
to
the
clothing
fund
and
that
the
poor
people
were
not
allowed
to
fit
themselves
however
the
applicants
were
finally
made
to
wait
outside
and
served
in
their
turn
alphabetically
an
arrangement
that
gave
great
umbrage
to
some
i
heard
one
woman
say
it
was
a
real
shame
she
should
have
to
wait
so
long
because
her
name
began
with
ho
another
woman
was
in
tears
because
a
baby
s
hood
given
to
her
had
no
pink
lining
a
neighbour
of
hers
she
said
had
one
from
the
belief
society
last
week
lined
with
beautiful
pink
silk
fit
for
a
little
princess
look
at
this
said
another
recipient
of
aid
holding
up
a
child
s
handsome
scarlet
mantle
there
s
where
the
tassel
should
be
and
i
won
t
go
away
till
it
s
found
still
another
woman
spoke
in
broken
accents
of
despair
of
a
pair
of
shoes
that
were
given
to
her
with
one
buckle
missing
it
would
be
unfair
however
not
to
mention
one
old
woman
who
seemed
to
be
quite
grateful
we
came
upon
her
in
the
lobby
rearranging
a
man
s
greatcoat
and
some
other
articles
of
male
attire
someone
near
her
asked
if
any
mistake
had
been
made
yes
my
dear
she
said
in
a
whisper
her
face
was
very
red
and
she
carried
with
her
a
strong
odour
of
some
liquor
there
s
been
some
blessed
mistake
and
i
m
just
hurrying
away
before
it
s
found
out
i
can
get
far
more
for
these
than
for
any
flimsy
perticoats
they
d
give
an
old
woman
like
me
i
am
this
instant
going
into
the
park
lands
with
dorothy
to
see
if
a
magpie
does
not
give
us
an
act
out
of
a
bird
comedy
by
the
way
talking
of
birds
the
last
time
lindsay
was
here
he
told
me
a
very
haroun
al
raschid
anecdote
of
a
man
who
lost
a
very
peculiar
on
the
murray
flats
and
found
it
a
year
afterwards
in
the
playhouse
of
a
silky
dangling
beside
the
capsule
of
a
and
the
scarlet
flowers
of
the
pretty
native
wistaria
mem
for
my
this
make
a
peg
on
which
to
hang
an
alibi
i
asked
lindsay
the
question
and
he
promptly
said
oh
if
it
was
to
save
a
fellow
from
swinging
of
course
it
would
never
be
found
now
you
know
how
little
speculative
or
morbid
he
is
is
it
possible
that
life
itself
is
often
more
morbid
than
any
reflections
regarding
it
fairacre
june
i
can
not
report
that
mother
is
better
but
she
insists
on
thinking
of
other
people
as
much
as
if
she
were
quite
well
poor
thomson
is
failing
rapidly
yesterday
at
her
wish
i
spent
part
of
the
day
in
taking
care
of
him
i
must
tell
you
what
happened
after
i
had
chatted
with
him
for
a
little
he
said
there
is
a
chapter
miss
stella
as
i
liked
when
i
was
a
in
the
old
bible
tis
about
being
took
up
by
the
hair
and
looking
in
at
places
and
seeing
the
weep
for
thomas
i
d
like
you
to
read
it
to
me
would
you
be
able
to
find
a
chapter
in
the
bible
by
this
i
doubt
whether
i
would
only
that
lately
i
have
been
rather
fascinated
by
ezekiel
it
was
the
eighth
chapter
he
the
likeness
as
the
appearance
of
fire
put
forth
the
form
of
a
hand
and
lifted
the
prophet
up
by
a
lock
of
his
hair
then
he
brought
me
to
the
door
of
the
gate
of
the
lord
s
house
which
was
toward
the
north
and
behold
there
sat
women
weeping
for
tammuz
i
like
them
parts
o
the
bible
so
strange
and
yet
they
seems
quite
real
like
you
may
be
sure
that
i
did
not
attempt
to
foist
any
interpretation
upon
the
text
there
is
a
point
at
which
those
who
have
read
much
of
the
best
and
those
who
have
read
very
little
seem
to
of
vague
mystery
and
wonder
leading
to
a
subtle
sense
of
the
marvels
that
lurk
under
the
masking
raiment
of
just
as
i
rose
to
go
the
storm
which
had
been
gathering
all
the
morning
began
to
come
down
in
torrents
the
rain
beat
sharply
against
the
and
the
room
suddenly
darkened
i
noticed
the
sick
man
gazing
at
the
window
with
a
very
sombre
look
an
expression
that
had
in
it
shall
i
say
it
tragic
than
poverty
or
disease
miss
stella
he
said
in
a
low
voice
do
you
believe
as
them
that
is
gone
could
ever
come
back
from
the
other
world
i
don
t
know
i
have
often
wondered
whether
they
do
or
can
i
answered
awed
by
a
sudden
conviction
that
the
man
to
use
our
nurses
phrase
had
at
some
time
seen
something
he
moved
restlessly
as
though
his
head
were
uneasy
i
smoothed
and
shifted
his
pillow
and
then
to
my
dismay
i
saw
that
great
tears
were
rolling
down
his
cheeks
no
doubt
he
had
moved
so
that
i
should
not
see
them
and
i
had
done
the
very
thing
i
ought
not
to
have
done
some
strong
wave
of
emotion
swept
over
him
his
bosom
heaved
convulsively
and
he
sobbed
half
aloud
i
felt
horribly
distressed
and
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
i
tidied
up
the
fireplace
and
put
some
wood
on
the
fire
i
saw
his
face
as
plain
as
daylight
at
that
very
window
a
week
ago
he
said
when
he
recovered
himself
and
then
he
told
me
this
little
story
he
came
to
south
australia
twenty
years
ago
a
lad
of
eighteen
he
was
for
some
weeks
a
hand
on
a
near
jarranda
bay
one
of
the
shepherds
suddenly
left
and
he
was
sent
to
take
his
place
a
few
days
after
he
went
to
the
stone
hut
as
it
was
called
he
found
an
old
black
woman
who
was
dying
and
had
with
her
only
her
daughter
a
a
slip
of
a
girl
of
fourteen
they
were
beside
a
little
creek
and
had
had
nothing
to
eat
for
three
days
except
a
big
snake
the
girl
had
killed
near
the
water
they
were
on
their
way
with
other
blacks
to
a
great
corroborree
that
was
to
be
held
eighty
miles
further
on
when
the
mother
was
taken
ill
and
left
behind
with
her
only
daughter
caloona
thomson
fed
them
and
gave
them
all
the
comforts
he
could
in
a
week
the
old
black
woman
died
and
then
the
girl
lived
with
him
he
engaged
himself
as
shepherd
for
two
years
and
stayed
altogether
for
eight
caloona
he
said
turned
out
mighty
handy
and
she
was
always
so
wonderfully
thankful
when
you
told
me
about
that
little
dog
of
yourn
miss
you
call
thought
he
was
for
all
the
world
like
my
poor
caloona
she
would
follow
me
about
and
wanted
to
wait
on
me
hand
and
foot
and
thought
so
much
on
me
i
tuk
to
reading
the
new
testament
and
minding
all
the
good
things
my
grandmother
used
to
tell
me
caloona
soon
learnt
to
cook
and
do
things
much
handier
nor
many
a
white
woman
and
she
kept
the
hut
as
neat
and
clean
as
a
new
pin
i
bought
clothes
and
things
for
her
from
a
hawker
and
if
you
believe
me
miss
stella
she
looked
much
prettier
in
them
than
many
an
altogether
white
girl
she
would
be
up
and
working
before
it
was
light
so
as
to
have
breakfast
and
dinner
cooked
and
come
out
with
me
after
the
sheep
even
when
the
little
boy
was
born
she
stopped
in
the
hut
but
a
few
days
she
was
that
proud
of
the
little
was
fairer
than
you
could
he
grew
very
fast
he
was
out
all
day
long
in
the
woods
with
his
mother
and
me
and
when
it
rained
we
just
made
a
of
boughs
for
him
and
put
a
possum
skin
over
it
he
was
sharper
nor
a
needle
and
many
s
the
time
he
made
us
lie
down
on
the
grass
roaring
with
laughing
at
his
ways
but
onfortinately
as
he
grew
older
he
showed
signs
of
a
very
bad
temper
and
he
would
turn
and
strike
his
mother
for
the
least
thing
i
could
not
stand
that
but
caloona
only
laughed
and
that
encouraged
him
that
was
what
come
between
us
i
allays
heard
as
mixed
bloods
was
worse
nor
full
blacks
or
full
whites
and
i
was
afraid
how
the
youngster
might
turn
out
when
we
was
out
shepherdin
and
in
the
evenings
caloona
used
to
tell
me
tales
o
her
mother
s
tribe
how
they
quarrelled
and
fought
and
in
the
end
murdered
each
other
sometimes
perhaps
for
the
sake
of
an
as
the
boy
got
older
i
couldn
t
bear
to
hear
her
laugh
over
them
things
then
i
thought
it
s
no
use
beginning
to
teach
the
boy
if
the
mother
knows
no
so
i
began
to
learn
her
to
read
and
write
she
was
not
long
in
learning
to
read
out
of
a
big
testament
my
mother
give
to
me
when
i
was
leaving
the
old
country
but
she
didn
t
seem
able
to
take
in
as
jesus
christ
was
man
and
god
and
she
gave
him
a
native
name
as
vexed
him
as
makes
and
i
suppose
i
couldn
t
explain
proper
for
when
i
tried
most
hard
she
would
go
off
in
a
fit
of
laughing
and
the
youngster
would
wake
up
and
laugh
too
fit
to
crack
his
sides
and
somehow
when
the
two
laughed
in
that
way
it
used
to
rile
me
oncommon
the
boy
was
very
as
saw
him
said
somehow
he
was
sharpest
in
doing
things
he
oughter
not
to
do
and
when
i
was
trying
to
teach
him
like
he
allays
seemed
duller
and
given
to
cryin
and
his
mother
used
to
watch
me
her
hands
all
of
a
tremble
at
whatever
she
was
doing
well
miss
stella
to
make
a
long
story
short
when
the
boy
was
a
few
weeks
over
seven
i
found
him
setting
a
puppy
on
to
some
sheep
with
young
lambs
i
took
him
by
the
hand
to
the
hut
and
before
punishing
him
i
asked
why
he
did
such
a
thing
his
mother
stood
there
shiverin
looking
at
us
and
the
boy
burst
out
cryin
and
denied
it
hard
an
fast
he
said
he
was
callin
the
dog
off
this
riled
me
so
much
that
on
the
instant
i
give
him
a
bad
thrashin
i
know
nor
i
should
that
the
mother
turned
on
me
very
fierce
like
i
got
into
a
bad
scot
an
told
her
if
she
didn
t
let
me
bring
up
the
boy
proper
she
had
better
clear
in
course
i
never
meaned
a
word
of
it
and
never
thought
as
caloona
would
take
it
to
heart
but
the
boy
sulked
and
would
eat
no
food
an
made
believe
he
was
very
badly
hurt
god
knows
perhaps
he
was
though
i
didn
t
believe
a
word
of
it
an
i
felt
very
hard
agin
him
for
telling
such
barefaced
lies
next
day
his
mother
stayed
in
the
hut
with
him
and
wouldn
t
even
look
at
me
when
i
was
going
out
when
i
came
home
that
night
they
were
both
gone
an
from
that
day
to
this
i
never
set
eyes
on
them
what
became
of
them
an
where
are
they
now
that
s
what
i
says
to
myself
over
an
over
agin
an
then
a
week
ago
before
the
lamp
was
lighted
i
saw
the
boy
out
there
at
the
window
in
the
rain
as
plain
as
i
see
you
now
miss
stella
this
morning
the
canon
said
as
i
ought
to
take
the
sacryment
and
i
was
thinking
over
things
the
moment
i
heered
your
voice
i
says
to
myself
i
ll
tell
miss
stella
she
ll
understand
as
twasn
t
through
my
being
such
a
bad
i
haven
t
got
very
much
longer
to
live
and
i
ve
many
times
heard
that
at
the
last
people
felt
quieter
like
if
they
told
all
that
was
on
their
minds
i
couldn
t
tell
the
canon
miss
stella
for
in
course
he
d
tell
his
wife
an
then
lord
only
knows
how
many
melanchorly
psalmses
she
d
read
to
me
next
day
an
yet
twas
through
trying
to
do
my
best
that
it
all
come
out
wrong
as
it
were
i
never
told
a
word
of
this
to
my
wife
what
d
be
the
good
twould
only
fret
her
the
more
simply
anything
is
told
the
more
is
lost
in
it
with
the
cold
little
snout
of
a
pen
the
very
homely
little
door
leading
into
the
kitchen
behind
where
the
wife
so
quiet
and
rain
dashing
against
the
small
window
through
which
the
sick
man
fancied
he
saw
his
boy
out
in
the
helped
to
make
a
quiet
but
forceful
seizure
on
the
heart
thomson
had
hardly
ceased
speaking
when
ferrier
entered
the
moment
i
saw
him
it
flashed
across
my
mind
that
the
boy
he
told
us
of
some
time
before
might
be
thomson
s
child
the
poor
man
was
so
exhausted
that
in
a
few
minutes
he
fell
fast
asleep
i
motioned
ferrier
to
the
window
and
asked
him
if
he
knew
anything
of
that
lad
s
mother
yes
she
had
been
at
the
mandurang
mission
six
months
before
she
died
her
native
name
was
caloona
i
told
him
thomson
s
story
as
briefly
as
possible
oh
how
wonderful
are
the
ways
of
the
lord
he
ejaculated
at
the
very
relevantly
i
thought
the
sick
man
was
soon
wakened
by
a
fit
of
coughing
when
this
was
over
ferrier
took
his
hand
and
said
my
friend
instead
of
reading
will
you
let
me
tell
you
a
little
incident
that
happened
at
the
mandurang
mission
station
thomson
nodded
a
weary
assent
as
if
he
knew
beforehand
that
this
could
have
no
interest
for
him
i
was
about
to
slip
away
but
thomson
asked
me
to
stay
a
little
longer
the
s
little
incident
was
soon
told
how
late
at
night
a
young
woman
with
a
boy
of
nine
came
to
the
mission
spent
with
illness
and
weary
wandering
she
had
lived
for
years
with
white
people
and
then
gone
back
to
her
tribe
but
the
savage
life
was
too
much
for
her
and
when
her
strength
began
to
fail
she
found
her
way
to
the
mission
anxious
to
have
her
boy
properly
cared
for
after
her
death
when
he
learned
the
names
of
the
mother
and
son
thomson
s
strength
seemed
to
return
to
him
in
a
strange
way
he
half
sat
up
his
face
all
alight
asking
a
torrent
of
questions
with
the
tenderness
of
a
woman
ferrier
gave
full
details
he
divined
that
this
strong
rugged
nature
wearied
with
mortal
illness
stricken
with
remorse
for
the
past
craved
hungrily
for
all
that
could
be
told
him
of
the
poor
fugitive
mother
and
her
boy
a
few
days
before
her
death
she
seemed
to
wander
said
ferrier
and
she
kept
on
saying
we
got
back
to
the
stone
hut
one
one
tired
and
hungry
but
strange
man
there
and
we
went
away
me
want
to
tell
masser
boy
very
good
now
but
masser
there
was
the
sound
of
deep
sobs
in
the
room
and
ferrier
s
voice
failed
him
i
went
to
the
little
window
and
looked
out
the
sky
was
overcast
and
on
the
horizon
played
in
wide
flames
there
was
thunder
in
the
air
and
the
atmosphere
was
heavy
and
made
me
feel
that
the
world
is
full
of
desolate
women
and
fugitive
children
the
murmur
of
voices
went
on
after
a
and
then
the
one
grave
voice
with
its
fervent
accents
they
are
buried
in
one
grave
in
the
mission
churchyard
at
mandurang
not
far
from
them
my
own
wife
and
only
daughter
lie
buried
ah
my
dear
friend
their
dust
reposes
there
in
the
sure
and
certain
hope
of
the
resurrection
of
the
just
in
the
words
of
a
holy
man
of
old
every
body
whether
it
is
dried
up
into
dust
or
dissolved
into
moisture
or
is
compressed
into
ashes
or
is
attenuated
into
smoke
is
withdrawn
from
us
but
is
reserved
for
god
in
the
custody
of
the
i
do
not
know
that
poor
thomson
took
in
much
of
this
she
went
back
went
back
again
he
said
several
times
in
a
low
voice
i
knew
well
the
youngster
was
dead
ever
since
i
seen
him
at
the
window
he
whispered
to
me
as
i
went
away
i
spare
you
my
reflections
as
i
walked
home
in
the
gathering
dusk
on
the
strangely
pathetic
threads
mingled
in
the
yarn
of
all
lives
when
we
know
something
of
their
inward
history
what
passionate
affections
to
end
in
a
little
mound
of
earth
what
fears
and
agitation
and
anguish
that
avail
nothing
what
vivid
hopes
held
close
in
the
heart
only
to
vanish
fruitlessly
as
morning
mist
what
glowing
plans
stretching
out
into
the
coming
years
to
end
in
bitter
disillusion
and
disenchantment
with
life
xvii
it
was
the
first
week
in
july
before
stella
left
home
for
her
visit
to
melbourne
and
lullaboolagana
this
delay
was
occasioned
by
her
mother
s
illness
which
at
first
seemed
trifling
but
eventually
developed
into
slow
fever
at
its
the
worst
lasted
four
or
five
gravest
fears
were
entertained
as
to
the
issue
during
this
time
stella
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
leave
her
mother
day
or
night
except
at
very
short
intervals
she
could
sleep
only
by
snatches
and
affirmed
that
she
was
more
rested
in
the
than
she
could
be
elsewhere
periodical
sleeplessness
was
the
only
ailment
from
which
she
had
suffered
since
her
childhood
and
at
this
anxious
period
her
incapacity
for
sleep
took
a
very
pronounced
form
as
soon
as
the
invalid
was
fit
to
travel
it
was
arranged
that
she
should
accompany
raymond
the
widowed
daughter
to
her
coonjooree
small
in
the
tatiara
district
distant
from
adelaide
by

look
as
much
in
want
of
rest
as
i
do
my
child
the
mother
said
fondly
when
the
preliminary
arrangements
were
made
and
stella
sat
pencil
in
hand
jotting
down
memoranda
of
the
things
maisie
who
was
to
accompany
her
in
the
capacity
of
maid
should
pack
up
for
two
or
three
months
absence
from
home
do
i
look
like
an
invalid
mother
really
she
said
with
a
bright
smile
esther
why
don
t
you
ask
me
to
your
sanatorium
for
the
sake
of
my
health
it
will
sound
so
my
dear
you
know
i
would
be
only
too
happy
but
tareling
is
in
despair
at
your
already
missing
the
most
brilliant
part
of
the
yes
and
to
make
up
for
missing
more
i
shall
come
to
coonjooree
for
a
week
you
were
afraid
to
tempt
me
have
you
not
yet
learned
that
to
be
tempted
and
fall
is
our
one
form
of
wisdom
in
some
things
well
that
is
a
delightful
item
added
to
our
programme
said
raymond
the
old
place
will
be
almost
forsaken
for

yes
july
and
august
the
memoirs
of
the
courtland
family
during
this
time
in
the
year
of
grace
were
strewn
with
events
fairacre
the
paternal
home
inhabited
only
by
tom
and
alice
in
the
guardianship
of
the
misses
kendall
esther
i
should
like
to
be
an
invisible
onlooker
during
this
regime
oh
can
t
you
imagine
how
the
two
dear
quaker
doves
will
spend
their
time
in
chivying
after
allie
with
wraps
when
she
goes
out
into
the
garden
with
felix
and
then
there
will
be
tom
and
course
they
will
be
engaged
before
we
come
and
you
my
will
have
happened
in
your
case
said
the
elder
sister
wistfully
oh
i
shall
be
two
or
three
months
older
laughed
stella
there
was
a
difference
between
her
and
raymond
of
thirteen
years
but
there
was
a
bond
of
sympathy
between
the
two
which
was
independent
of
all
differences
of
age
and
experience
stella
s
week
at
coonjooree
lengthened
into
ten
days
laurette
will
understand
the
fascination
that
the
mallee
scrub
has
for
one
said
stella
laughing
as
she
recalled
tareling
s
undisguised
horror
of
cannawijera
the
station
settled
on
her
by
her
father
and
distant
from
coonjooree
about
fifteen
miles
and
yet
to
many
the
mallee
scrub
like
all
deserts
comes
to
have
an
inexplicable
charm
to
realize
the
change
that
may
gradually
be
wrought
on
the
mind
in
this
respect
one
should
perhaps
enter
the
mallee
country
when
the
mask
of
night
is
falling
on
the
land
and
travel
for
hours
under
a
moon
struggling
ineffectually
for
supremacy
with
driving
clouds
in
the
uncertain
light
all
that
can
then
be
seen
is
an
endless
succession
of
low
undulating
rises
or
plains
that
stretch
indefinitely
on
every
side
with
clumps
of
scrub
cypress
rising
here
and
there
above
the
mallee
bushes
the
traveller
should
further
be
a
guest
at
one
of
those
in
which
a
stranger
asks
himself
incredulously
what
he
has
ever
done
to
deserve
the
unbounded
hospitality
and
kindness
showered
on
him
it
should
be
what
stands
for
winter
in
this
dry
waterless
region
he
should
waken
at
sunrise
and
gaze
for
the
first
time
at
the
mallee
scrub
in
the
light
of
day
through
an
eastern
window
and
there
the
scene
that
meets
his
eye
far
and
wide
as
he
may
have
wandered
will
be
stored
in
the
cells
of
memory
for
all
time
to
come
the
sight
has
in
it
something
which
compels
him
to
dwell
on
it
long
and
fixedly
and
turn
to
it
again
and
again
while
a
strange
weight
falls
on
the
heart
and
the
mind
for
some
time
vainly
seeks
a
clue
to
the
mingled
and
contradictory
feelings
that
are
awakened
there
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
lies
tier
beyond
tier
in
endless
succession
low
chains
of
ranges
with
dense
bushes
tall
brown
clumps
of
with
patches
of
white
and
yellow
sand
showing
between
during
winter
in
the
early
mornings
the
sky
is
often
one
unbroken
mass
of
gray
clouds
as
the
sullen
red
in
the
east
that
proclaims
sunrise
dies
away
there
is
no
tint
or
suggestion
of
colour
anywhere
visible
in
heaven
or
earth
all
around
without
break
or
alloy
are
the
uniform
monotonous
tones
of
sand
and
bushes
above
is
the
more
sombre
gray
of
clouds
in
which
the
eye
vainly
loses
itself
seeking
for
a
lighter
tinge
they
are
so
austere
and
thickly
clouds
that
promise
rain
but
pass
away
oftentimes
week
after
week
without
a
shower
they
hide
the
blue
of
heaven
and
the
sunshine
and
rigidly
shroud
the
horizons
as
if
to
make
the
picture
more
arid
formless
mass
above
a
sombre
colourless
desolation
it
is
as
though
one
came
upon
the
rigid
skeleton
of
a
spent
world
or
upon
a
living
presentment
of
primeval
chaos
when
the
earth
was
without
form
and
void
a
bitter
loneliness
falls
upon
the
spirit
all
the
sunny
nooks
of
the
earth
seem
so
far
away
life
seems
so
so
unreal
the
mind
is
thrown
in
on
itself
and
an
immense
ennui
takes
possession
of
the
it
oppresses
it
as
though
it
were
suddenly
touched
by
a
heavy
hand
it
is
as
though
all
that
men
most
cling
to
in
life
passed
away
like
mist
before
the
sun
till
nothing
remained
but
this
arid
wilderness
without
the
song
of
bird
or
sound
of
water
or
gleam
of
flower
or
even
the
foliage
of
a
tree
in
these
regions
severe
and
desolate
as
the
dead
sea
wilderness
in
which
the
son
of
man
was
assailed
by
the
great
enemy
of
souls
the
petty
distinctions
for
which
men
and
women
scramble
and
cheat
and
lie
in
everyday
life
shrink
into
trivial
toys
these
vast
parched
domains
lying
in
all
their
nakedness
under
a
sunless
sky
have
nothing
to
befool
the
soul
they
have
a
terrible
sincerity
in
whose
cold
light
not
the
picture
which
we
so
fondly
weave
of
life
but
life
itself
in
all
its
pale
disenchantment
makes
a
sudden
seizure
on
the
questioning
spirit
in
such
an
hour
the
multitudinous
trifles
that
choke
the
soul
like
the
white
ashes
of
a
are
blown
away
as
with
the
breath
of
a
strong
west
wind
winnowing
the
chaff
from
the
grain
in
face
of
so
stern
a
solitude
we
cease
to
deceive
ourselves
the
country
is
not
wild
it
is
in
appearance
sterile
to
a
degree
it
is
tame
it
is
dull
it
is
oftentimes
solitary
as
a
tomb
few
see
it
for
the
first
time
without
experiencing
a
causeless
often
dark
forebodings
as
of
some
dread
disaster
slowly
drawing
nearer
and
yet
this
wears
away
and
the
country
how
is
one
to
account
for
it
comes
to
have
a
fascination
of
its
own
it
is
so
silent
so
severe
so
implacable
in
its
veracity
it
has
no
arts
with
which
to
allure
no
winning
surprises
no
breaks
in
its
uniformity
through
the
greater
part
of
the
year
and
though
at
first
this
scenery
agitates
and
weighs
on
those
who
lie
open
to
the
charms
that
usually
draw
us
to
nature
yet
after
the
first
shock
is
over
this
strange
landscape
bends
the
mind
to
itself
and
gains
a
subtle
hold
on
hold
based
not
so
much
on
tenderness
as
confidence
it
fulfils
far
more
than
it
promises
notwithstanding
its
parched
and
barren
appearance
a
little
irrigation
makes
it
blossom
into
wonderful
fertility
and
though
no
water
is
ever
seen
on
its
surface
it
is
believed
by
those
who
know
the
region
best
that
great
reservoirs
extend
far
below
these
infinite
leagues
of
sandy
ground
the
theory
is
so
far
borne
out
by
the
fact
that
where
artesian
wells
have
been
sunk
in
this
district
water
has
been
struck
in
overflowing
abundance
planted
where
water
is
available
are
in
four
and
five
years
loaded
with
luscious
fruit
here
as
in
so
many
other
directions
nature
waits
to
be
governed
by
obedience
to
her
conditions
dig
and
ye
shall
find
water
and
ye
shall
reap
if
the
principle
that
anyone
who
makes
wasteland
productive
became
its
owner
were
enforced
the
mallee
scrub
instead
of
being
a
barren
waste
even
in
appearance
might
soon
become
a
great
granary
of
fruit
and
corn
but
even
in
its
present
state
it
has
a
brief
hour
of
beauty
in
the
zenith
of
the
australian
spring
this
scrub
is
in
places
sheeted
in
blossoms
brilliant
little
orchids
scarlet
and
yellow
flowers
the
pale
lemon
blossom
of
the
native
clematis
the
small
purple
geraniums
with
their
poignant
fragrance
when
crushed
under
and
many
other
wild
blossoms
as
yet
alas
nameless
to
the
laity
invest
the
country
with
a
charm
all
the
more
deeply
felt
because
of
the
contrast
between
these
fleeting
weeks
and
the
sombre
monotony
which
prevails
during
the
rest
of
the
year
in
july
the
country
was
at
its
dreariest
for
the
rains
which
fall
oftentimes
with
tropical
fury
are
instantly
absorbed
by
the
sand
whose
thirst
is
never
satiated
and
though
there
is
then
more
herbage
than
through
the
drought
of
the
summer
the
uniformity
of
tints
is
seldom
varied
the
sombre
olive
of
the
mallee
shrubs
the
sterner
green
of
the
dwarf
honeysuckle
whose
pointed
leaves
when
ruffled
by
the
wind
show
their
silver
like
pale
buds
that
never
blossom
the
solemn
hue
of
the
scrub
cypress
the
pallid
of
the
are
minor
tones
in
the
same
sad
monotonous
lacklustre
hues
yet
day
by
day
as
stella
became
more
intimate
with
the
mallee
scrub
its
nameless
attractions
grew
on
her
and
one
day
as
she
rambled
miles
away
with
the
two
elder
children
she
discovered
a
whole
of
early
epacris
the
brief
blossoming
season
of
the
region
was
yet
two
months
off
yet
here
were
acres
of
this
radiant
native
heath
white
and
scarlet
and
tender
pink
the
feast
this
made
for
the
eyes
in
the
midst
of
the
harsh
setting
all
round
made
stella
feel
as
if
for
the
first
time
she
knew
what
the
joy
of
colour
meant
and
then
they
were
constantly
coming
upon
stores
of
white
snowy
blossoms
of
the
desert
so
lightly
rooted
in
the
sand
it
seems
as
though
a
passing
breath
would
bear
them
afar
but
no
though
the
wind
blows
shrill
and
high
the
of
the
wilderness
remain
in
myriads
of
clumps
the
snowy
coronals
of
silky
petals
round
their
hearts
on
brownish
dry
stalks
with
a
few
slender
leaflets
sadly
as
the
itself
all
give
a
tender
charm
to
the
flowers
they
are
scentless
and
have
none
of
the
dewy
bloom
of
ordinary
blossoms
but
seeing
that
their
faces
are
seldom
wet
with
rain
and
that
the
tips
of
their
roots
never
touch
water
the
marvel
is
that
their
pensive
radiance
ever
illuminates
this
land
of
all
the
flowers
that
grow
they
are
those
that
one
may
pluck
with
least
compunction
weave
them
into
or
and
at
the
end
of
two
years
they
are
as
white
and
silken
as
on
the
day
they
left
their
native
scrub
xviii
it
was
to
these
placid
pursuits
that
stella
devoted
herself
on
the
afternoon
preceding
her
departure
for
melbourne
during
the
past
few
days
she
had
experienced
a
curious
shrinking
from
the
visit
to
read
and
sew
and
meditate
to
listen
to
her
mother
s
gentle
voice
to
wage
mimic
warfares
with
her
sister
over
their
best
beloved
authors
to
ramble
with
the
children
looking
for
new
flowers
and
strange
birds
seemed
just
then
the
plan
of
life
best
worth
having
these
tranquil
days
succeeding
hours
of
acute
anxiety
soothed
her
into
a
mood
in
which
the
prospect
of
change
and
the
clamour
of
strange
voices
repelled
her
she
knew
so
well
how
she
would
weary
of
herself
in
the
society
of
women
whose
highest
ideal
of
life
was
to
stifle
it
with
futile
details
and
then
the
inevitable
meeting
with
ted
disturbed
her
in
anticipation
in
the
solitude
of
the
mallee
scrub
those
vagrant
glimpses
of
a
future
wholly
pledged
to
him
came
to
wear
the
air
of
a
grotesque
dream
but
she
told
herself
that
the
strong
temptation
which
assailed
her
to
break
faith
with
laurette
was
only
another
example
of
her
instability
and
now
maisie
was
engaged
in
labelling
the
luggage
for
their
early
departure
in
the
morning
and
stella
sat
with
her
sister
in
the
western
veranda
busily
weaving
the
immortelles
she
had
gathered
with
the
children
that
morning
i
solemnly
entrust
these
four
to
your
charge
esther
she
said
as
she
gave
the
finishing
touches
to
one
all
my
life
i
have
seen
these
little
wreaths
round
pictures
but
never
have
i
had
any
for
myself
till
and
whose
will
your
pretty
wreaths
honour
asked
the
elder
sister
one
for
father
and
last
one
taken
of
them
for
you
one
for
cuthbert
and
one
left
ah
i
perhaps
for
a
nearer
one
still
and
a
dearer
yes
if
he
has
to
sail
the
salt
dividing
seas
and
go
to
strange
countries
and
kill
lions
like
enclosed
birds
but
why
these
hard
conditions
oh
just
the
power
of
association
don
t
you
know
the
way
girls
have
of
hanging
a
man
in
a
cosy
nook
in
their
own
bearded
being
who
is
away
exploring
or
in
the
northern
territory
or
pearling
or
or
taking
stock
across
an
unknown
tract
of
the
continent
there
the
pictures
are
so
safe
and
snug
with
white
everlasting
flowers
round
them
while
the
men
only
knows
what
they
are
doing
or
what
is
happening
to
them
in
the
stella
wreathed
a
few
more
immortelles
into
places
less
thickly
covered
and
then
held
the
wreath
at
a
little
distance
to
judge
it
more
critically
yes
that
will
do
it
is
worthy
to
surround
the
picture
even
of
the
unknown
one
she
said
with
a
dawning
smile
stella
will
you
think
me
inquisitive
tell
me
all
there
is
to
tell
about
your
unknown
partner
at
the
emberly
ball
i
have
heard
broken
hints
and
laughing
allusions
from
alice
said
esther
regarding
her
sister
narrowly
it
is
only
alice
s
idea
of
a
joke
said
stella
but
she
coloured
slowly
there
is
not
much
to
tell
but
i
will
tell
you
shortly
after
the
ball
began
leslie
came
up
to
me
just
after
a
dance
saying
there
is
a
friend
of
my
husband
s
a
stranger
here
who
wishes
to
be
introduced
some
woman
seized
upon
her
at
the
moment
to
ask
a
score
of
questions
about
the
leslies
departure
for
europe
they
were
going
you
know
the
very
next
day
then
leslie
tore
herself
away
and
led
the
stranger
to
me
and
all
i
heard
was
miss
stella
and
i
think
perhaps
but
i
am
not
sure
and
i
rather
hoped
i
did
not
hear
but
why
well
it
is
very
stupid
but
this
stranger
had
what
you
might
call
a
distinguished
air
with
a
noble
brow
and
a
look
as
of
one
dissociated
from
the
vulgar
tide
of
but
surely
a
doctor
may
be
and
look
every
inch
a
gentleman
he
may
but
then
as
a
rule
he
is
us
at
any
rate
he
is
the
bourgeois
who
has
taken
to
expensive
habits
of
living
before
he
can
quite
afford
it
and
so
he
must
have
a
great
deal
of
tact
and
cultivate
a
trick
of
looking
wise
and
of
listening
reverently
to
the
twaddle
of
a
rich
hypochondriac
and
in
short
of
all
the
professions
the
medical
is
the
one
that
most
easily
degenerates
into
a
i
think
my
dear
you
are
prejudiced
what
about
your
beloved
stein
but
then
you
see
he
is
a
german
oh
you
may
laugh
but
culture
lies
at
the
root
of
all
the
professions
in
germany
far
more
than
in
england
as
i
know
neither
country
except
from
an
australian
standpoint
i
feel
qualified
to
pronounce
judgment
but
seriously
t
your
average
doctor
exactly
like
your
average
pianiste
profoundly
out
of
touch
with
most
of
the
wider
issues
of
thought
or
research
but
you
see
the
profession
is
a
very
arduous
one
to
be
a
successful
doctor
a
man
must
be
a
specialist
to
a
great
to
be
a
successful
doctor
a
man
as
a
rule
gets
into
the
narrowest
of
grooves
and
the
more
money
he
makes
the
more
furniture
and
he
heaps
about
him
instead
of
limiting
his
practice
and
dusting
his
mind
a
little
more
i
don
t
know
whether
it
is
matrimony
that
destroys
the
profession
as
it
ruins
the
influence
of
the
protestant
you
are
incorrigible
about
marriage
said
esther
laughing
the
worst
of
it
is
you
partly
mean
all
you
say
but
we
are
not
getting
on
very
fast
let
us
conclude
that
the
stranger
was
not
a
doctor
though
after
all
if
he
resembled
his
friend
yes
he
also
is
one
of
the
exceptions
but
then
the
stranger
had
the
look
of
one
so
shall
i
say
it
to
ideas
and
not
jostled
up
with
the
meannesses
of
ordinary
life
and
then
his
mind
had
an
alert
literary
kind
of
side
to
it
you
might
very
well
retort
on
me
by
asking
how
i
should
judge
of
all
this
but
you
know
one
gets
so
awfully
and
wonderfully
weary
of
the
commercial
stamp
of
mind
and
face
one
quickly
recognises
the
you
must
have
had
a
good
deal
of
talk
with
yes
we
wasted
no
time
not
even
in
dancing
he
danced
only
square
dances
and
after
going
through
a
quadrille
we
sat
out
a
waltz
which
stretched
into
nearly
two
more
dances
yes
it
sounds
rather
serious
but
so
much
depends
on
the
way
things
you
must
know
we
were
not
on
a
staircase
nor
the
recesses
of
a
conservatory
nor
on
a
veranda
lit
only
by
were
in
one
of
those
alcoves
that
allie
and
i
have
raved
about
ever
since
and
in
front
there
was
dear
amiable
marwood
and
a
large
elderly
lady
from
the
country
who
seemed
to
have
daughters
married
in
every
known
quarter
of
the
globe
there
the
two
good
old
dames
sat
chatting
away
like
two
fountains
and
there
were
we
two
others
getting
more
and
more
charmed
with
each
other
in
the
irresponsible
way
of
people
who
meet
least
i
hope
he
was
charmed
with
me
i
can
answer
for
oh
no
i
dare
say
he
was
dreadfully
bored
said
esther
smiling
and
then
was
there
not
a
wonderful
tasmanian
fern
that
partly
screened
you
from
the
partners
you
cheated
yes
a
tall
graceful
creature
with
hundreds
of
and
fronds
drooping
one
over
the
other
and
baby
ones
curled
up
tight
fold
within
fold
looking
as
though
they
had
taken
a
vow
never
to
emerge
from
their
infant
dreams
of
the
woodland
dell
where
they
first
saw
the
i
should
very
much
like
to
know
what
you
two
others
talked
of
but
perhaps
it
was
too
much
coeur
ouvert
et
à
langue
to
be
confided
to
a
mere
elder
sister
oh
nonsense
but
what
remains
of
the
talk
that
has
delighted
us
most
one
may
as
well
try
to
recall
a
walk
on
the
seashore
on
a
summer
night
there
was
the
moonlight
and
the
sparkle
of
the
glancing
stars
and
there
were
the
waves
breaking
on
the
beach
and
others
coming
after
them
endlessly
but
how
much
can
we
convey
of
the
scene
to
another
a
good
deal
smiled
esther
do
i
not
remember
how
your
first
exercises
in
composition
were
writing
conversations
down
verbatim
the
pieces
of
moonlight
globed
in
crystal
as
i
have
heard
allie
call
the
electric
light
in
the
alcoves
the
flowers
and
the
crush
of
people
and
the
wonderful
austrian
that
would
make
talk
after
a
first
dance
but
not
for
so
very
well
after
our
quadrille
my
partner
said
he
was
only
in
adelaide
two
days
he
had
just
landed
and
was
on
his
way
to
some
of
the
other
colonies
though
he
had
fallen
into
such
a
piece
of
luck
i
thought
it
was
a
very
fleeting
form
of
fortune
and
said
das
glück
ist
eine
leichte
dirne
und
bleibt
nicht
lang
am
selber
a
pleased
look
came
into
his
face
his
mother
was
a
german
though
brought
up
in
england
and
the
language
was
his
second
i
read
heine
then
oh
yes
and
nearly
all
the
german
writers
and
i
had
translated
goethe
his
face
fell
comically
i
know
he
was
astounded
at
such
conceit
know
what
a
delightful
sensation
it
is
to
see
a
little
downright
fun
looming
on
the
i
said
with
unmoved
seriousness
i
know
kant
too
very
well
and
it
is
a
great
consolation
for
when
the
hairdresser
comes
to
dress
my
hair
for
a
ball
i
pass
the
time
by
remembering
bits
out
of
the
kritik
of
pure
oh
stella
what
put
such
a
comical
thought
into
your
head
of
course
he
found
you
out
then
yes
and
we
both
laughed
heartily
and
that
you
know
is
like
eating
salt
is
a
sort
of
mental
latchkey
when
tom
came
to
claim
his
dance
after
my
partner
and
i
had
sat
out
a
waltz
we
were
both
in
rome
i
told
tom
i
would
let
him
off
his
duty
dance
and
so
we
still
talked
on
an
unfortunate
man
slipped
and
fell
with
his
partner
in
front
of
our
alcove
surely
that
is
one
of
the
tragic
situations
of
life
said
my
partner
i
said
there
must
be
a
great
many
more
then
and
we
began
to
count
but
we
fell
out
at
once
he
declared
existence
would
be
honeycombed
with
tragedy
if
my
contentions
as
to
tragic
situations
were
allowed
we
grew
serious
and
laughed
the
next
moment
and
flouted
each
other
s
arguments
but
i
will
tell
you
one
of
the
he
said
to
dance
and
talk
and
then
to
part
i
was
just
on
the
point
of
saying
especially
if
you
do
not
know
your
partner
s
name
when
to
my
horror
there
was
andrew
harrison
and
the
for
which
he
was
down
on
my
programme
almost
i
suppose
you
did
not
say
you
would
let
him
off
his
duty
dance
and
did
you
and
your
unknown
partner
meet
no
more
no
we
smiled
and
bowed
and
parted
and
i
saw
him
no
more
and
the
leslies
sailed
next
morning
and
of
course
the
emberlys
could
tell
nothing
of
any
special
stranger
there
were
so
many
whose
names
and
faces
were
equally
unknown
to
them
now
are
you
satisfied
it
is
like
the
beginning
of
a
overture
that
should
be
followed
by
a
concert
i
esther
paused
abruptly
scanning
her
sister
s
face
with
an
inquiring
look
you
must
not
get
on
the
wrong
track
esther
said
stella
who
was
now
weaving
a
little
out
of
some
everlastings
that
were
left
tom
and
allie
could
not
get
over
my
sitting
out
nearly
three
dances
with
anyone
i
never
did
such
a
thing
before
but
the
attraction
was
unexpectedly
meeting
someone
who
seemed
to
have
all
the
makings
of
a
friend
in
a
friend
my
dear
like
willie
stein
and
harrison
i
suppose
how
horrid
you
can
be
esther
it
is
the
very
fact
that
most
men
have
so
few
strings
to
their
nature
that
makes
one
so
soon
understand
the
sort
of
people
that
are
different
i
have
for
a
long
time
thought
that
one
of
the
greatest
pleasures
of
life
would
be
a
real
great
lasting
friendship
it
takes
so
much
to
form
a
true
one
there
is
as
a
wise
man
says
in
human
nature
generally
more
of
the
fool
than
of
the
wise
yet
the
part
of
us
which
is
not
a
fool
responds
so
gladly
to
the
sane
enlightened
strain
of
another
mind
but
it
must
be
different
from
one
s
own
that
is
why
the
best
friendships
require
the
difference
of
how
very
sage
and
calm
that
sounds
said
esther
with
an
amused
expression
but
after
all
what
shoals
there
are
most
men
and
women
are
either
married
or
expect
to
and
yet
my
pair
of
friends
must
be
single
or
widowed
they
must
have
an
a
deep
books
but
still
deeper
in
life
itself
so
that
they
are
like
the
spectators
of
a
play
in
which
nothing
can
happen
that
has
not
some
significance
only
life
being
so
much
greater
so
much
wider
and
more
complex
than
any
picture
of
it
can
possibly
be
it
always
strikes
and
women
opposite
points
of
you
are
quite
convinced
that
your
ideal
friendship
must
be
based
not
only
on
difference
of
sex
but
dissimilarity
of
view
well
you
may
be
right
but
how
long
would
it
last
between
two
disengaged
people
how
many
weeks
would
pass
before
that
strong
interest
in
books
and
in
the
general
play
of
human
affairs
would
be
centralized
oh
esther
you
are
too
tiresome
of
course
that
is
the
rock
on
which
the
ordinary
friendship
of
an
ordinary
man
and
woman
it
is
is
worse
than
my
dear
you
have
gone
through
the
process
more
than
once
said
esther
a
smile
hovering
round
her
lips
yes
and
the
soft
silly
look
that
comes
into
a
man
s
way
in
which
he
is
perpetually
on
the
for
some
point
of
personal
the
opportunity
of
paying
some
inane
course
all
that
is
the
very
antipodes
of
true
unbiassed
intercourse
flattery
is
the
lethal
spot
of
friendship
it
is
the
cryptogram
for
and
yet
i
suppose
friendship
like
love
must
be
nourished
by
admiration
to
some
yes
but
then
love
or
at
all
events
the
thinglet
that
usually
goes
by
that
name
is
always
seeking
its
own
ends
whereas
it
is
a
root
of
that
divine
severe
force
which
constantly
calls
upon
us
to
be
true
to
our
best
capabilities
no
receipt
openeth
the
heart
but
a
true
friend
to
whom
you
may
impart
griefs
joys
fears
hopes
suspicions
counsels
and
whatsoever
lieth
upon
the
heart
to
oppress
it
in
a
kind
of
civil
shrift
or
confession
and
again
the
best
preservative
to
keep
the
mind
in
health
is
the
faithful
admonition
of
a
friend
you
know
who
says
this
yes
but
how
rare
such
intercourse
is
between
man
and
so
it
is
and
that
makes
it
all
the
more
well
if
ever
you
form
such
a
friendship
stella
you
must
tell
me
and
do
not
conceal
the
end
said
esther
with
a
smile
by
this
time
the
sun
had
set
and
a
light
mist
hung
over
the
sombre
ranges
that
stretched
westward
giving
them
a
mysteriously
limitless
aspect
as
though
they
extended
beyond
the
confines
of
the
world
this
impression
was
deepened
by
low
masses
of
clouds
driven
before
a
rising
wind
the
outlines
were
so
uncertain
and
broken
and
the
prospect
so
wide
and
lonesome
and
silent
that
the
whole
formed
a
picture
which
for
weird
austerity
could
hardly
be
surpassed
i
ll
tell
you
what
you
must
live
at
coonjooree
and
ask
me
to
stay
with
you
esther
said
stella
i
am
only
just
beginning
to
find
out
all
the
allurements
of
the
place
last
night
i
watched
the
moon
setting
and
the
look
of
the
desert
in
the
pale
lessening
light
was
indescribably
solemn
the
place
seems
to
have
been
created
to
make
up
striking
pictures
that
somehow
make
one
in
love
with
and
to
carry
a
sheep
to
three
t
forget
the
sheep
stella
would
you
really
come
and
stay
here
with
me
but
i
confess
i
would
be
afraid
of
so
much
solitude
one
must
be
either
older
or
younger
than
i
am
for
that
i
think
we
had
better
set
off
on
our
travels
you
and
i
and
the
children
and
their
do
you
not
find
it
chilly
out
there
my
dears
there
is
such
a
charming
fire
of
mallee
roots
here
said
courtland
opening
the
window
under
which
her
daughters
were
sitting
in
the
veranda
the
twilight
was
deepening
and
the
clouds
were
gathering
more
impenetrably
but
within
the
quiet
warm
little
fragrant
with
the
breath
of
violets
it
was
that
charmed
hour
when
the
hearth
smiles
to
itself
and
gilds
the
roof
with
mirth
and
it
would
be
a
sin
to
light
the
lamps
as
some
old
writers
speak
of
a
substance
called
babylonian
naphtha
which
is
so
inflammable
that
it
kindles
into
flame
if
it
is
placed
near
fire
without
touching
it
old
dry
mallee
roots
when
split
up
have
something
of
that
quality
they
are
strangely
twisted
and
gnarled
as
if
the
waterless
wastes
in
which
they
grew
had
thwarted
and
stunted
them
till
they
are
fit
emblems
of
a
defeated
existence
but
when
they
break
into
flame
it
is
as
though
they
pass
into
a
brief
life
of
ecstatic
joy
no
other
wood
makes
so
vivid
and
pure
a
fire
the
flames
are
a
delicate
clear
jonquil
the
roots
on
the
least
touch
flash
into
ardent
lustrous
arrows
of
light
whose
glow
seems
to
warm
the
mind
as
well
as
the
body
the
mother
and
her
daughters
sat
round
this
glancing
softly
brilliant
fire
and
talked
of
the
past
and
future
of
things
that
had
been
and
that
were
to
be
in
the
calm
unapprehensive
way
which
gradually
returns
even
to
those
who
have
sustained
many
of
the
storms
and
shocks
of
life
xix
her
brother
was
absent
in
tasmania
when
stella
arrived
in
melbourne
for
the
first
two
days
nothing
more
noteworthy
than
drives
and
calls
and
invitations
to
coming
festivities
marked
the
hours
the
smaller
house
which
the
tarelings
had
taken
was
in
toorak
one
of
our
most
fashionable
suburbs
as
i
dare
say
even
you
may
see
laurette
said
as
they
drove
by
spacious
mansions
and
large
grounds
monico
lodge
was
not
distinguished
by
these
advantages
it
had
that
irritating
pretentiousness
about
it
which
takes
the
form
of
several
large
and
diminutive
sleeping
apartments
when
stella
entered
her
room
she
looked
round
it
with
a
feeling
of
comical
dismay
it
seemed
as
though
the
walls
were
not
far
enough
apart
to
enable
her
to
breathe
freely
as
for
the
in
which
maisie
slept
the
wardrobe
filled
it
up
so
completely
that
the
poor
maid
seemed
to
have
been
smuggled
into
the
closet
for
some
nefarious
purpose
there
was
a
conservatory
devoted
entirely
to
exotics
and
gardeners
plants
but
there
was
no
garden
and
the
grounds
a
most
conventionally
formed
snippit
of
land
were
chiefly
adorned
with
trees
which
refused
to
grow
rooted
in
tubs
that
refused
to
be
concealed
but
even
more
uncongenial
than
these
surroundings
was
laurette
s
constant
society
with
her
unconcealed
triumph
at
being
in
the
thick
of
all
that
was
most
distinguished
and
fashionable
in
melbourne
as
she
herself
expressed
it
when
this
triumph
seemed
on
the
point
of
being
a
little
dimmed
she
fell
into
transports
of
delight
at
the
prospect
of
an
indefinite
stay
in
town
if
talbot
had
not
made
this
lucky
hit
in
mining
shares
i
could
only
have
been
here
for
a
couple
of
weeks
she
said
what
with
the
low
price
of
wool
and
papa
s
fearful
losses
with
the
rabbits
he
has
given
us
a
great
deal
of
money
from
time
to
time
but
he
has
turned
very
rusty
of
late
as
for
ted
you
might
as
well
ask
a
doornail
for
money
i
hope
he
will
marry
some
nice
girl
soon
who
will
teach
him
to
despise
filthy
lucre
a
this
with
a
sidelong
look
at
stella
who
laughed
at
this
pious
aspiration
but
made
no
comment
everything
jarred
upon
her
so
much
that
at
first
she
could
not
even
write
a
letter
the
day
after
her
arrival
she
sent
a
telegram
to
coonjooree
proposing
to
write
the
next
day
on
the
morrow
she
wrote
a
on
the
third
day
she
scolded
herself
seriously
and
sat
down
at
her
desk
she
had
only
written
the
words
my
darling
mother
when
she
leant
her
head
on
her
hand
and
went
into
a
long
reverie
during
which
a
curiously
wistful
softened
expression
came
into
her
eyes
she
was
roused
by
a
tap
at
the
door
are
you
here
stella
it
was
laurette
and
she
wore
an
impromptu
air
of
surprise
guess
who
has
come
she
said
with
an
arch
smile
oh
cuthbert
exclaimed
stella
her
face
radiant
as
she
hastened
to
join
him
no
your
brother
can
not
be
here
till
the
evening
it
is
stella
s
face
flushed
but
it
did
not
escape
laurette
s
keen
gaze
that
with
this
deepening
colour
the
sudden
radiance
of
gladness
died
away
he
is
so
delighted
to
find
that
you
are
here
i
hadn
t
time
to
say
three
words
when
he
sent
me
off
for
you
i
must
interview
the
cook
about
luncheon
you
will
find
ted
in
the
there
was
something
in
laurette
s
tone
and
manner
which
stella
greatly
resented
but
it
was
on
the
whole
easier
to
ignore
this
than
call
it
in
question
edward
ritchie
met
her
in
the
hall
and
took
both
her
hands
in
his
with
so
eager
and
impassioned
an
air
that
stella
instinctively
stepped
back
and
drew
her
hands
quickly
away
saying
lightly
to
hide
her
confusion
at
last
i
shall
know
whether
you
have
been
in
egypt
or
central
you
look
thinner
than
you
used
to
stella
said
the
young
man
so
absorbed
in
gazing
at
her
that
it
seemed
as
though
he
heard
nothing
and
have
grown
stouter
yes
really
ted
you
remind
one
of
the
beauties
in
the
arabian
like
the
beauties
oh
come
now
stella
draw
it
mild
what
kind
of
beauties
were
they
oh
they
used
to
have
adventures
sometimes
they
were
put
in
a
box
the
box
in
a
chest
with
seven
locks
on
it
and
placed
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
beneath
the
roaring
waves
sometimes
they
were
put
in
baskets
sewn
up
with
red
thread
but
whatever
happened
to
them
they
always
turned
up
all
right
again
with
faces
like
the
moon
in
the
fourteenth
so
that
s
why
you
compared
me
to
those
beauties
stella
well
i
couldn
t
believe
you
were
paying
me
a
compliment
but
tell
me
now
are
you
glad
to
see
me
oh
yes
of
course
but
why
do
you
always
alight
like
a
bomb
is
the
wind
from
the
east
oh
bother
the
wind
tell
me
all
about
yourself
have
you
been
well
all
the
time
i
don
t
believe
you
have
you
used
not
to
have
circles
under
your
eyes
and
they
look
the
better
to
see
you
with
answered
stella
smiling
the
most
obvious
quotation
however
was
always
thrown
away
on
ted
but
why
are
you
not
looking
well
he
persisted
well
you
know
mother
had
a
fever
but
dancing
is
good
for
me
so
i
have
come
to
stay
with
laurette
that
i
may
dance
for
weeks
before
going
into
the
how
often
will
you
dance
with
me
stella
well
that
depends
you
used
to
waltz
out
of
time
have
you
had
any
practice
during
your
travels
what
travels
you
seem
to
think
i
have
been
gallivanting
about
amusing
myself
stella
i
barely
know
how
to
hold
myself
with
joy
for
seeing
you
again
and
do
you
know
you
hardly
shook
hands
with
me
but
if
someone
held
your
ten
fingers
in
a
vice
could
you
shake
hands
well
give
me
your
hand
again
i
will
not
hold
it
hard
or
i
ll
tell
you
what
you
just
hold
my
hand
about
as
tight
as
you
wish
me
to
hold
yours
you
see
i
m
perfectly
thank
you
ted
the
way
i
want
you
to
hold
my
hand
is
not
to
touch
it
at
present
we
have
a
little
irishman
who
comes
to
work
at
laracor
and
i
have
learned
to
talk
irish
you
stella
was
sitting
on
a
low
chair
near
the
fire
ritchie
stood
over
her
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
carried
away
by
a
sudden
impulse
he
knelt
down
and
held
her
hands
to
his
lips
they
were
so
hot
that
they
seemed
to
scorch
her
fingers
oh
but
really
ted
it
appears
to
me
that
you
are
too
absurd
she
said
the
feeling
of
amusement
with
which
this
faithful
squire
usually
inspired
her
struggling
with
a
sense
of
growing
discomfort
do
you
remember
the
last
time
i
saw
you
he
asked
drawing
a
chair
close
beside
her
i
can
not
speak
to
you
ted
without
twisting
my
neck
do
please
go
a
little
further
oh
hang
it
all
haven
t
i
been
far
away
long
enough
he
tried
to
hold
her
hands
in
his
she
slipped
away
and
took
a
chair
opposite
to
him
now
we
can
talk
comfortably
she
said
tell
me
have
the
rabbits
eaten
all
your
father
s
sheep
as
laurette
says
do
you
remember
how
long
it
is
since
we
parted
we
are
just
like
two
people
in
a
burlesque
said
stella
smiling
we
fire
off
question
after
question
without
once
answering
each
well
why
don
t
you
answer
me
and
sit
down
nearer
to
me
and
be
a
little
jollier
but
that
is
the
point
i
would
not
be
at
all
jolly
if
i
twisted
my
neck
oh
i
assure
you
it
is
much
worse
than
spraining
one
s
do
you
remember
the
day
we
parted
so
many
months
ago
persisted
ritchie
he
was
a
man
to
whom
rapid
thought
was
impossible
but
it
was
equally
impossible
to
divert
his
mind
from
the
point
of
view
which
was
uppermost
with
him
oh
heavens
yes
i
remember
everything
cried
stella
with
her
low
merry
laugh
that
always
had
a
magical
charm
for
her
companion
you
remember
everything
he
repeated
slowly
i
am
glad
of
that
for
you
know
very
he
stopped
abruptly
his
eyes
had
been
fixed
on
stella
s
face
intently
and
he
noticed
that
it
grew
cold
and
a
trifle
hard
the
change
made
his
heart
heavy
with
apprehension
yes
what
do
i
know
very
well
she
answered
taking
up
the
ravelled
thread
with
an
impatient
weariness
she
felt
that
this
long
wooing
must
end
once
for
all
then
as
she
noticed
the
agitated
breathless
way
in
which
ritchie
looked
at
her
an
acute
apprehension
of
all
that
this
long
courtship
meant
to
him
suddenly
smote
her
and
therewith
a
pang
of
remorse
as
she
realized
how
far
she
had
somehow
travelled
from
the
old
tolerant
standpoint
when
she
had
decided
that
if
she
married
anyone
without
being
in
love
it
must
be
ted
he
looked
at
her
for
some
minutes
without
speaking
and
stella
knew
it
was
because
he
feared
to
put
the
old
question
into
words
she
was
always
ready
to
see
how
faulty
she
to
blame
herself
where
blame
was
due
she
was
all
the
more
conscious
of
any
blame
that
might
attach
to
her
in
this
long
intermittent
wooing
because
by
some
process
which
she
herself
could
not
have
explained
the
moment
they
met
it
became
clearer
to
her
that
those
fugitive
resolves
that
she
harboured
from
time
to
time
after
they
last
parted
of
accepting
ritchie
as
her
future
in
truth
at
least
possible
only
at
some
indefinite
now
ted
i
am
very
sorry
she
said
humbly
after
a
pause
sorry
he
echoed
why
are
you
sorry
i
don
t
expect
you
to
love
me
as
i
love
you
it
s
not
the
way
of
ted
would
sometimes
make
running
comments
on
herself
and
things
in
general
that
amused
stella
speculations
theories
and
musings
on
things
in
general
were
quite
foreign
to
his
nature
while
they
were
part
of
her
daily
atmosphere
and
yet
she
was
vaguely
conscious
that
as
his
point
of
view
might
be
it
rested
on
contact
with
more
sides
of
life
than
were
open
to
her
ken
if
you
ll
only
just
put
up
with
me
at
first
stella
i
m
willing
to
run
the
oh
it
isn
t
your
risk
i
think
of
so
much
she
answered
looking
up
into
his
face
smilingly
he
was
standing
nearer
to
her
again
leaning
on
the
mantelpiece
pulling
a
large
red
rose
asunder
and
letting
the
petals
fall
on
her
one
by
one
by
the
way
i
heard
konrad
jarred
his
is
he
she
said
with
rather
a
barefaced
attempt
at
getting
away
from
the
subject
all
right
again
but
i
haven
t
been
thinking
much
of
horses
lately
i
ve
had
other
fish
to
what
fish
ted
oh
ted
to
call
me
a
fish
and
speak
of
frying
me
and
pull
that
beautiful
rose
to
pieces
at
the
same
time
why
it
had
hardly
opened
and
roses
just
now
are
what
would
you
like
me
to
do
why
let
me
see
i
think
in
this
crisis
of
australian
history
every
squatter
should
study
how
to
exterminate
rabbits
and
conserve
confound
the
rabbits
and
conserving
water
look
here
stella
you
always
twist
me
round
your
fingers
in
this
stella
held
up
her
hands
deprecatingly
what
makes
you
say
such
dreadful
things
about
my
poor
fingers
oh
you
know
very
well
what
i
mean
time
after
time
i
ve
asked
you
to
marry
me
and
said
to
myself
now
i
ll
decide
it
one
way
or
the
other
but
you
turn
it
into
a
sort
of
joke
what
has
put
this
funny
notion
of
marrying
into
your
head
ted
you
say
or
you
hold
up
your
fingers
before
i
ve
said
a
word
and
laugh
saying
now
ted
when
you
knit
your
brow
in
that
way
it
always
means
something
spoony
oh
ted
i
never
used
that
cried
stella
laughing
despite
her
efforts
to
keep
serious
well
it
doesn
t
matter
about
one
word
you
know
what
i
mean
don
t
you
yes
i
know
what
you
i
feel
i
have
been
very
much
to
no
you
haven
t
retorted
ritchie
almost
roughly
you
haven
t
been
to
blame
it
s
me
who
used
to
feel
that
i
d
sooner
be
made
a
fool
of
by
you
than
have
any
other
girl
throw
herself
at
my
head
i
ve
drawn
back
as
frightened
as
a
wombat
when
you
began
to
be
serious
i
wanted
things
to
be
the
same
for
fear
i
mightn
t
even
come
to
see
you
from
time
to
time
but
everything
must
have
an
end
i
d
like
you
to
marry
me
on
any
re
not
fond
of
anyone
else
she
did
not
reply
at
once
and
the
young
man
recalled
the
hints
that
his
sister
had
thrown
out
at
godolphin
house
why
don
t
you
tell
me
he
cried
in
a
husky
voice
no
but
then
i
can
imagine
that
i
could
love
and
i
think
before
a
woman
risks
marrying
she
should
we
have
been
friends
so
long
i
will
be
quite
frank
with
you
i
have
sometimes
thought
i
could
marry
you
since
we
last
oh
stella
stella
god
in
heaven
bless
you
for
saying
that
cried
ted
breathlessly
but
then
ted
i
have
oftener
thought
i
could
not
i
think
that
we
should
be
a
little
more
alike
it
is
such
a
frightful
long
not
always
some
people
die
off
before
they
re
anytime
but
it
would
be
unwise
to
count
on
that
form
of
happiness
answered
stella
and
then
she
gave
way
to
an
uncontrollable
burst
of
laughter
and
as
for
not
being
alike
said
ted
who
always
enjoyed
the
girl
s
merriment
even
when
not
a
muscle
of
his
own
face
moved
why
there
s
not
many
fellows
that
would
care
to
have
their
wives
like
themselves
and
i
would
perhaps
get
a
little
bit
like
you
after
we
married
stella
we
would
have
so
much
time
together
at
we
could
travel
or
whatever
you
the
was
turned
in
an
ostentatiously
preliminary
way
and
then
laurette
came
in
would
you
mind
keeping
away
for
a
little
longer
larry
said
her
brother
on
which
laurette
laughed
in
a
knowing
way
bowed
and
disappeared
oh
how
could
you
ted
laurette
will
imagine
all
sorts
of
she
will
imagine
that
we
are
getting
engaged
and
that
s
what
s
going
to
happen
stella
you
never
could
throw
me
off
after
all
these
years
you
know
that
i
love
you
with
my
whole
heart
and
soul
don
t
you
i
believe
that
you
love
me
a
great
deal
more
than
i
deserve
but
try
and
put
yourself
in
my
place
think
how
different
the
thought
of
marrying
me
would
be
if
you
did
not
love
it
s
no
use
my
trying
to
think
that
i
ve
loved
you
ever
since
i
was
that
high
said
ted
holding
his
hand
four
feet
from
the
ground
well
it
goes
to
my
heart
to
think
of
grieving
you
don
t
t
say
it
you
can
t
know
what
a
i
d
be
if
you
took
away
all
hope
from
me
let
s
stay
as
we
are
and
think
over
used
to
the
thought
that
you
are
to
be
my
don
t
plead
with
me
so
worries
me
i
feel
as
if
i
must
give
way
and
that
would
be
fatal
do
not
interrupt
me
you
don
t
understand
what
a
hatefully
creature
i
feel
when
i
get
indifferent
to
but
you
are
not
indifferent
to
quite
no
not
now
but
then
i
see
so
little
of
you
well
i
wouldn
t
be
always
at
home
don
t
think
it
i
m
away
from
strathhaye
sometimes
for
weeks
and
when
i
m
there
i
m
out
most
of
the
day
well
you
can
laugh
as
much
as
you
like
though
i
ll
be
shot
if
i
can
make
out
often
what
amuses
you
so
much
well
you
really
are
too
original
in
some
ways
you
tell
me
that
sometimes
people
die
off
early
in
married
life
and
that
we
would
not
see
much
of
each
by
way
of
yes
because
i
m
trying
hard
to
follow
your
lead
though
by
jove
it
would
go
very
much
against
the
grain
with
me
either
to
die
or
be
away
from
you
after
we
are
heavens
you
make
my
flesh
creep
when
you
talk
as
if
it
were
an
accomplished
fact
there
is
one
thing
i
want
to
say
to
you
one
thing
a
thousand
say
so
many
that
you
will
never
be
done
till
we
are
both
old
and
i
must
go
away
and
write
my
letters
if
you
are
to
be
so
no
stella
i
ll
be
dumb
as
a
sonnet
tell
me
the
one
those
pearls
that
you
left
the
day
before
you
went
what
about
them
don
t
you
care
for
them
they
are
very
lovely
but
wait
a
stella
went
to
her
room
and
presently
returned
with
the
morocco
case
in
her
hand
on
seeing
this
ritchie
s
face
became
very
sombre
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
think
of
my
birthday
only
mind
you
must
forget
so
tiresome
an
anniversary
after
i
m
but
you
know
i
can
not
take
such
a
costly
gift
from
all
i
have
is
yours
why
shouldn
t
you
take
this
it
s
a
isn
t
it
you
know
that
is
for
he
pressed
the
spring
and
looked
at
the
pearls
no
they
are
too
superb
to
be
given
or
accepted
in
a
careless
way
you
must
take
them
back
please
i
did
not
even
show
them
to
take
them
back
repeated
ritchie
his
face
flushing
with
vexation
what
should
i
do
with
the
damned
thing
is
it
right
for
you
to
say
that
before
me
no
and
i
beg
your
pardon
but
you
should
not
vex
me
so
much
you
must
keep
them
now
i
ve
got
to
see
my
trainer
at
one
o
clock
and
after
that
to
take
a
spin
down
to
kilda
but
i
want
you
to
promise
to
come
out
for
a
ride
with
me
morning
i
have
the
neatest
little
colt
for
you
that
ever
you
saw
now
i
can
see
you
are
trying
to
think
of
an
indeed
i
am
not
i
shall
be
delighted
to
ride
the
air
here
stifles
one
i
am
only
thinking
how
i
shall
be
dragged
to
give
an
account
of
all
these
friendly
rides
and
talks
the
next
time
the
spirit
moves
you
to
have
a
square
understanding
well
you
needn
t
think
anything
of
the
kind
you
sometimes
thought
you
could
marry
me
why
stella
i
could
live
on
that
for
a
year
the
last
thing
i
do
at
night
is
to
look
at
your
picture
when
i
look
at
it
i
shall
hardly
be
able
to
believe
you
said
that
now
put
both
your
hands
in
won
t
hurt
say
god
bless
you
ted
the
same
as
you
did
in
the
fairacre
she
gave
him
her
hands
and
repeated
the
words
with
a
little
tremor
in
her
voice
which
thrilled
him
through
and
through
with
happiness
he
held
her
hands
very
gently
and
lifted
them
one
after
the
other
to
his
lips
and
then
he
hurried
away
stella
threw
herself
into
an
for
some
moments
she
was
buried
in
one
of
those
profound
meditations
in
which
every
faculty
of
her
mind
became
absorbed
in
a
tyrannous
compulsory
at
her
own
special
span
of
the
past
as
part
of
an
unfathomable
enigma
she
was
presently
roused
by
laurette
s
shrill
voice
so
ted
had
not
even
stayed
to
lunch
oh
she
made
no
complaint
she
knew
too
well
thai
at
certain
times
in
a
man
s
life
sisters
in
common
with
all
the
rest
of
the
world
must
take
a
back
on
like
people
in
the
pit
of
a
theatre
who
see
as
through
a
glass
darkly
and
see
little
laurette
s
eyes
fell
on
the
pearls
and
she
uttered
a
little
cry
of
delight
what
a
splendid
jewel
why
this
looks
like
business
stella
it
s
better
to
be
born
lucky
than
rich
after
laurette
surveyed
herself
in
the
mirror
of
the
and
held
the
brooch
under
her
chin
admiringly
then
she
fastened
it
in
the
lisse
ruffling
of
stella
s
dress
but
stella
quickly
unfastened
it
put
it
into
the
case
and
closed
it
with
what
laurette
mentally
called
a
vicious
it
does
not
belong
to
me
she
said
coldly
in
answer
to
laurette
s
look
of
amazed
inquiry
it
is
meant
for
the
young
woman
who
has
been
born
more
lucky
than
rich
she
added
with
a
mischievous
smile
xx
the
hon
talbot
tareling
was
at
this
time
absent
at
banjoleena
a
new
which
had
recently
excited
much
attention
no
form
of
work
had
ever
attracted
tareling
unless
it
was
of
a
light
irregular
nature
with
a
strong
element
of
gambling
hence
dabbling
in
mining
shares
was
the
one
australian
industry
he
found
tolerable
he
made
erratic
excursions
to
mines
from
time
to
time
ostensibly
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
straight
tip
this
as
a
rule
proved
very
disastrous
but
lately
fortune
had
smiled
on
him
he
long
held
shares
in
a
mine
which
neither
development
nor
sensational
rumours
could
galvanize
into
popularity
however
there
was
an
assay
which
yielded
an
enchanting
result
instantly
a
boom
set
in
in
favour
of
the
celestial
hill
mine
its
dingy
branch
office
in
a
dingy
back
street
in
melbourne
was
besieged
by
eager
applicants
for
shares
women
in
rusty
black
unsuccessful
business
men
who
had
long
eschewed
mining
ventures
but
had
got
tired
of
seeing
idle
brainless
clerks
turning
notes
into
fifties
spinsters
who
had
saved
one
or
two
hundred
pounds
by
toilsome
years
of
penurious
saving
clergymen
with
families
far
in
excess
of
their
incomes
artisans
who
were
weary
of
the
faded
simplicity
of
investments
at
seven
and
six
per
a
word
that
numerous
class
with
whom
the
longing
to
widen
or
enrich
life
takes
the
form
of
narrowing
are
always
preparing
to
live
but
never
especially
to
the
fore
in
buying
celestial
hills
it
was
so
safe
it
was
no
bogus
concern
it
had
been
worked
for
a
long
time
and
now
they
had
struck
and
here
was
the
average
four
and
a
half
ounces
to
the
ton
and
everyone
knew
that
half
an
ounce
paid
then
scraps
of
paper
would
be
produced
and
rapid
memoranda
made
and
eager
faces
flushed
with
excitement
at
the
splendid
percentage
it
was
while
the
results
were
at
their
best
on
paper
that
tareling
sold
out
nearly
all
the
shares
he
held
a
week
afterwards
they
were
not
worth
a
withered
fig
then
ugly
rumours
began
to
circulate
when
people
are
aching
with
the
loss
of
money
slander
seems
to
be
a
balm
to
the
wounded
spirit
the
mine
had
been
salted
a
false
had
been
drawn
up
a
clandestine
lump
of
gold
had
been
dropped
into
the
how
was
it
too
that
the
of
the
directors
had
sold
out
rump
and
stump
tareling
was
one
of
these
but
like
pilate
he
washed
his
hands
in
public
he
still
had
all
the
shares
that
he
originally
held
the
fact
being
that
the
bulk
had
been
bought
with
his
wife
s
money
and
in
her
name
he
was
supported
in
his
innocence
by
ozias
the
son
of
lazarus
popularly
surnamed
judas
this
man
wrote
to
the
press
bearing
testimony
to
the
childlike
faith
which
the
hon
talbot
tareling
still
put
in
the
celestial
hill
on
which
some
people
arched
their
eyebrows
and
prophesied
that
if
this
scion
of
an
ancient
family
had
recourse
to
many
more
testimonials
of
this
kind
his
business
career
in
melbourne
would
soon
be
blocked
naturally
all
this
duplicity
rendered
tareling
still
more
wary
he
upheld
the
practice
of
finding
out
whether
a
mine
really
existed
before
investing
in
it
such
a
plan
as
some
of
the
brokers
remarked
would
upset
any
system
of
mining
that
had
yet
been
in
vogue
laurette
in
the
meantime
found
the
present
in
many
respects
the
most
beatific
season
she
had
ever
passed
in
melbourne
her
growing
intimacy
with
the
viceregal
family
more
than
realized
her
most
ardent
expectations
she
was
fast
rising
to
that
social
eminence
in
which
her
dresses
opinions
and
parties
would
form
topics
of
eager
interest
among
women
who
a
short
time
previously
had
barely
acknowledged
her
as
an
equal
if
it
were
not
for
increasing
money
difficulties
her
enjoyment
would
have
been
almost
without
alloy
but
ted
s
presence
gave
her
a
feeling
of
security
she
vaguely
felt
that
in
some
way
she
would
turn
it
to
account
she
went
with
him
to
the
theatre
on
the
evening
that
followed
his
arrival
and
stella
anticipated
the
pleasure
of
a
long
with
cuthbert
who
arrived
that
afternoon
from
tasmania
alas
it
was
not
an
unmixed
happiness
what
her
soul
feared
had
come
to
pass
after
the
first
greetings
and
inquiries
were
over
stella
fixed
her
eyes
on
her
brother
s
face
in
an
inquiring
way
cuthbert
you
look
very
radiant
has
anything
happened
but
came
to
me
the
first
evening
i
am
oh
heavens
you
are
colouring
up
to
the
roots
of
your
hair
but
stella
dear
you
misrepresent
yourself
you
know
that
you
would
be
the
first
to
congratulate
be
glad
with
my
now
you
are
breaking
it
to
me
king
of
the
jews
yes
i
can
bear
it
all
is
it
the
rev
carter
s
daughter
you
are
a
little
witch
you
pretended
to
tremble
about
these
daughters
before
i
ever
thought
anything
about
dora
except
what
a
charming
girl
she
as
if
that
were
not
the
alpha
and
omega
of
the
infatuation
that
precedes
you
little
heretic
oh
there
is
not
much
of
a
story
except
that
we
are
both
perfectly
happy
dora
went
with
her
mother
to
launceston
a
week
before
i
did
we
met
frequently
the
day
before
we
left
we
went
mountaineering
with
a
few
others
it
was
all
settled
before
we
returned
carter
charged
me
with
her
kind
love
and
wishes
you
to
come
and
spend
a
day
or
as
long
as
tareling
will
spare
you
can
you
come
well
the
day
after
dora
and
i
will
call
before
twelve
so
that
you
may
see
a
little
of
her
before
you
meet
the
whole
stella
fell
in
with
this
arrangement
with
rather
a
disconsolate
little
look
and
so
you
are
perfectly
happy
but
don
t
smile
too
often
cuth
or
you
will
spoil
the
serious
lines
in
your
face
i
like
so
much
let
me
look
at
you
sideways
so
that
s
the
way
one
looks
when
one
is
first
engaged
ted
is
stouter
than
you
are
i
am
afraid
the
joy
of
being
accepted
would
quite
ruin
his
you
will
love
dora
stella
you
can
not
imagine
what
a
darling
she
quite
fond
of
you
i
have
often
shown
her
your
letters
and
she
is
quite
charmed
with
them
ah
i
was
waiting
for
the
cloven
hoof
except
well
dear
she
is
very
devout
and
has
the
beautiful
untroubled
faith
of
childhood
she
is
vexed
to
think
that
you
should
be
so
uncertain
so
s
the
ecclesiastical
a
look
of
pain
came
into
the
brother
s
face
and
then
of
course
stella
repented
i
am
horribly
jealous
i
know
that
she
said
lay
a
charm
over
me
cuthbert
sprinkle
me
with
holy
water
beat
a
brass
pan
to
drive
the
evil
spirits
don
t
be
cross
with
cross
with
you
stella
have
i
ever
been
that
have
i
not
loved
you
fondly
ever
since
you
were
a
dear
funny
little
baby
who
would
not
let
people
lead
you
when
you
were
a
year
old
but
preferred
all
the
bumps
you
got
to
being
held
by
the
hand
yes
my
ownest
boy
you
have
always
been
to
me
like
a
guardian
angel
oh
far
better
yes
let
me
be
unorthodox
while
dora
isn
t
here
after
all
a
guardian
angel
keeps
at
a
discreet
distance
but
to
the
girl
s
own
astonishment
she
burst
into
tears
her
brother
it
must
be
confessed
was
rather
pleased
he
always
a
little
dreaded
the
vein
of
which
the
satan
letter
was
so
signal
an
example
that
would
at
times
become
apparent
in
stella
it
clung
to
his
mind
at
times
like
a
superstition
that
in
a
mood
of
angry
defiance
or
disgust
or
impatience
of
the
sweet
inevitable
humdrum
of
life
she
might
take
some
course
which
would
lead
to
bitter
misery
or
at
the
least
cloud
and
hamper
the
better
possibilities
of
her
nature
she
was
human
through
and
through
but
a
mocking
ironical
tone
came
to
her
she
wept
very
rarely
and
when
tears
did
come
they
became
her
wonderfully
and
made
her
for
a
time
adorably
gentle
but
it
seemed
this
was
not
one
of
these
occasions
can
you
believe
my
dear
stella
that
my
love
for
you
will
ever
be
less
because
of
other
ties
it
seems
to
me
rather
that
this
new
sweet
love
makes
all
other
affection
deeper
and
yes
dear
i
know
said
stella
smiling
through
her
tears
it
makes
you
feel
like
our
torrens
after
the
winter
no
i
won
t
accept
that
comparison
you
must
think
of
a
prettier
one
do
i
not
know
how
the
torrens
gets
in
the
drought
of
summer
do
you
believe
that
the
leanness
of
dry
december
will
ever
overtake
my
love
for
you
i
know
you
will
never
be
anything
but
what
is
dear
and
good
still
it
is
quite
evident
to
me
that
i
must
either
get
converted
or
married
and
i
fear
of
the
two
the
latter
is
the
more
practicable
you
see
dear
she
said
in
answer
to
a
smile
it
is
not
to
be
endured
that
i
should
write
or
say
anything
which
would
vex
dora
so
you
and
i
can
no
longer
be
intimate
friends
oh
i
know
the
atmosphere
in
which
an
clergyman
s
daughter
is
brought
up
there
is
a
standard
for
are
so
many
clauses
of
a
creed
so
many
articles
to
be
believed
then
all
the
evil
and
misery
and
astounding
chaos
of
life
is
made
out
to
be
a
jumble
between
god
and
the
devil
and
man
s
sometimes
it
is
one
sometimes
the
the
reputed
creator
of
all
must
never
be
blamed
and
in
the
face
of
everything
there
must
be
an
amazing
kind
of
thing
that
leads
a
precarious
kind
of
existence
by
brigandage
on
the
understanding
by
injecting
minute
doses
of
morphia
into
the
pores
of
reason
judge
how
many
letters
of
mine
could
be
anything
but
a
snare
and
a
grief
to
one
who
has
been
saturated
with
that
way
of
my
dear
you
must
not
talk
like
that
he
said
taking
her
slim
fair
hands
between
his
brown
vigorous
ones
if
i
did
not
know
you
so
well
i
should
be
afraid
you
and
dora
would
not
get
on
but
you
rail
against
most
people
theoretically
and
end
by
charming
you
certainly
will
charm
this
dear
new
sister
who
is
to
you
speak
as
though
a
sister
were
a
kind
of
rare
exotic
to
me
cuthbert
don
t
forget
that
i
already
have
six
yes
certainly
i
must
always
count
myself
and
this
with
hector
and
claude
s
wives
makes
up
the
unromantic
dora
seven
did
you
know
that
the
sacredness
of
the
number
seven
was
fast
rooted
in
the
civilization
of
babylon
i
know
that
you
are
sometimes
the
most
whimsical
monkey
under
the
sun
and
that
to
this
day
i
don
t
always
know
when
you
are
in
fun
or
in
i
am
in
earnest
now
cuth
i
wish
you
every
joy
and
blessing
yes
now
i
have
got
over
the
first
shock
i
shall
be
glad
that
you
are
happier
the
day
after
that
i
shall
begin
to
love
dora
god
bless
you
cuthbert
she
kissed
her
brother
on
the
forehead
on
each
cheek
and
on
the
old
form
of
embrace
which
she
had
instituted
in
token
of
reconciliation
after
their
rare
quarrels
in
the
old
childish
days
i
wonder
said
her
brother
after
a
pause
when
i
shall
have
to
congratulate
you
under
the
same
happy
circumstances
now
if
you
like
dear
leaving
out
the
happy
she
said
solemnly
is
ritchie
in
town
yes
he
came
and
morning
i
go
with
him
on
the
trimmest
little
colt
in
the
this
ride
took
the
form
of
going
to
brighton
and
a
delightful
gallop
by
the
seaside
during
which
the
colour
leapt
into
stella
s
cheeks
with
charming
vividness
while
her
eyes
seemed
to
imprison
rays
from
the
glancing
sparkles
of
light
on
the
waves
ted
could
scarcely
take
his
eyes
off
her
face
he
longed
to
say
a
hundred
things
but
seeing
that
she
was
disinclined
to
talk
he
also
kept
silent
it
was
almost
pathetic
to
notice
how
implicitly
he
responded
to
her
moods
as
far
as
lay
in
his
power
he
did
not
understand
her
veiled
irony
her
bookish
allusions
her
sudden
sparkling
merriment
at
those
trifles
light
as
air
which
touch
the
keen
edges
of
a
mind
fully
alive
to
the
incongruities
of
life
but
he
understood
when
she
wished
to
be
silent
or
talk
when
she
wanted
to
hear
about
his
horses
and
when
the
wonderful
bay
colt
who
promised
to
surpass
all
previous
records
became
intolerable
to
her
before
turning
homeward
they
paused
at
a
little
headland
the
waves
crested
with
foam
broke
against
this
in
rollicking
tumbled
masses
there
was
a
breeze
fresh
enough
to
ruffle
the
sea
surface
so
that
the
waves
stretching
out
to
the
vast
horizon
curled
here
and
there
into
foam
and
broke
on
the
shore
with
a
shuddering
cadence
which
was
momentarily
lost
and
yet
rose
again
making
itself
distinct
from
the
deeper
symphony
of
the
multitudinous
waters
far
off
there
were
voices
in
the
sea
that
morning
which
made
stella
s
heart
beat
as
if
she
were
listening
to
passionate
music
singly
and
near
at
hand
the
waves
lisped
and
prattled
but
altogether
and
far
off
what
solemn
and
terrible
strength
what
possibilities
of
sudden
irretrievable
shipwreck
did
they
symbolize
the
mount
tabors
and
gehennas
that
darkly
lurk
within
the
human
inappeasable
longing
for
certainty
of
storms
and
sorrows
a
few
moments
here
are
worth
a
month
of
stupid
melbourne
incessantly
mimicking
other
mimicries
said
stella
taking
off
her
hat
so
that
the
breeze
might
sweep
away
the
tags
and
knots
of
tiresome
thoughts
that
would
thrust
themselves
between
her
and
the
sunshine
how
long
are
you
going
to
stay
with
laurette
oh
i
hardly
know
you
see
i
must
be
several
weeks
at
lullaboolagana
and
i
want
to
get
back
to
adelaide
before
the
spring
is
i
hope
to
be
in
adelaide
too
before
the
spring
is
over
shall
i
come
first
to
fairacre
oh
yes
i
am
sure
mother
and
all
will
be
very
glad
to
see
won
t
you
but
as
a
friend
do
you
know
i
was
quite
cut
up
when
i
heard
there
was
some
talk
last
year
of
your
leaving
the
old
were
you
really
ted
why
well
you
know
i
spent
many
a
happy
holiday
there
cuth
and
i
don
t
chum
much
now
somehow
but
we
were
very
good
friends
at
peter
s
though
he
was
always
miles
ahead
of
me
do
you
remember
the
day
we
walked
up
to
the
weir
and
you
crouched
for
half
an
hour
behind
a
rock
watching
two
mountain
ducks
or
some
other
comical
little
brutes
that
paddled
about
in
the
water
do
you
remember
showing
me
the
head
of
a
ant
through
a
microscope
by
jove
i
can
t
imagine
how
they
make
a
few
glasses
tell
such
thundering
lies
i
believe
i
remember
the
first
time
i
saw
you
were
four
then
you
came
with
your
mother
to
stay
for
a
week
when
you
were
eight
years
old
you
climbed
up
to
the
top
of
a
tree
with
me
and
told
me
you
liked
me
ever
so
much
better
than
now
then
ted
honour
bright
you
did
you
were
the
jolliest
little
trump
of
a
girl
i
ever
saw
you
played
leapfrog
with
me
and
tore
the
lace
of
your
pinafore
you
didn
t
want
anyone
to
see
it
so
i
got
a
needle
and
thread
and
helped
you
to
sew
it
i
ran
the
needle
into
my
finger
to
the
bone
i
remember
it
well
because
i
went
to
peter
s
the
next
monday
and
my
thumb
was
swollen
i
wrote
so
badly
they
put
me
into
pothooks
and
hangers
we
used
to
have
latin
every
day
and
spelling
once
a
week
i
never
took
to
latin
and
i
hated
spelling
and
even
if
i
liked
it
five
lines
of
dictation
once
in
seven
days
wouldn
t
make
a
literary
character
of
a
chap
i
m
rather
weak
in
spelling
to
this
day
as
i
dare
say
you
notice
when
i
propose
to
you
from
time
to
time
i
always
get
my
to
write
my
business
yes
i
suppose
that
s
easier
than
to
learn
to
spell
oh
much
you
see
it
s
in
this
with
me
like
everything
else
once
i
make
up
my
mind
to
a
thing
i
can
t
alter
it
and
it
seems
i
generally
make
up
my
mind
wrong
in
the
spelling
line
but
i
say
stella
do
you
remember
that
birthday
i
got
a
little
sparrow
without
many
feathers
on
it
in
your
moreton
oh
i
can
see
you
do
i
asked
you
to
give
me
a
kiss
for
it
but
you
wouldn
t
when
will
you
have
you
bribed
many
girls
since
then
to
kiss
you
ted
a
dull
red
mounted
into
ritchie
s
face
that
isn
t
the
to
the
point
in
hand
stella
and
tell
well
perhaps
never
indeed
most
likely
i
don
t
believe
that
count
it
on
your
left
hand
as
we
used
to
do
with
the
begin
with
the
thumb
saying
shall
i
ever
give
ted
a
kiss
go
no
no
no
that
s
not
fair
stella
you
must
stop
with
the
little
finger
and
the
dear
little
finger
says
yes
i
shall
get
a
diamond
hoop
for
that
little
finger
now
then
ask
it
when
this
is
to
come
off
say
spring
hurrah
exactly
when
i
this
is
a
charming
horse
of
yours
yes
i
ve
had
him
trained
on
purpose
for
you
i
thought
he
was
about
the
style
of
horse
you
would
now
i
think
of
it
you
always
get
into
this
sort
of
carnival
when
we
come
out
riding
i
don
t
think
i
shall
come
with
you
don
t
say
that
stella
you
must
come
for
rides
in
the
morning
as
long
as
you
are
in
town
and
when
i
go
back
to
strathhaye
i
shall
almost
believe
you
are
coming
when
shall
i
see
you
there
stella
ted
you
are
far
from
amusing
when
you
keep
on
harping
on
the
same
string
in
this
way
it
is
about
time
we
turned
back
we
are
going
to
lunch
with
some
of
laurette
s
prize
hens
it
would
be
rather
nice
to
play
the
lord
stella
don
t
tempt
me
in
that
way
or
i
shall
really
carry
you
off
don
t
you
hear
it
in
the
horses
hoofs
spring
it
s
as
plain
as
a
pike
staff
you
never
look
half
so
jolly
anywhere
else
as
you
do
on
horseback
we
shall
spend
our
honeymoon
on
of
it
at
least
oh
i
can
t
help
it
stella
you
get
into
my
head
when
we
come
out
riding
say
a
sonnet
to
me
and
it
will
take
my
spirits
down
where
is
the
ship
to
which
yon
land
must
go
of
course
stella
laughed
at
this
unconscious
travesty
and
the
absurd
memories
it
revived
and
ritchie
seeing
her
laugh
was
wise
enough
to
say
nothing
more
that
would
recall
the
dreadful
threat
that
she
would
not
ride
out
with
him
again
before
they
parted
she
had
promised
him
three
dances
at
a
ball
to
which
they
were
going
that
night
xxi
you
and
ted
must
have
had
a
very
pleasant
ride
said
laurette
a
little
maliciously
as
they
drove
to
the
mansion
yes
the
sea
and
the
air
were
delightful
answered
stella
calmly
if
you
keep
that
charming
colour
will
fall
in
love
with
you
on
the
spot
since
reading
some
book
or
other
she
is
quite
enthusiastic
about
healthy
if
they
combine
what
she
calls
a
rare
organization
with
dabbling
in
the
fine
arts
you
don
t
model
in
clay
or
paint
or
sing
do
you
no
i
m
like
the
cat
with
one
trick
my
one
accomplishment
is
still
i
fancy
you
ll
take
with
my
melbourne
friends
why
do
you
laugh
you
made
me
think
i
must
be
or
a
new
shade
of
ribbon
what
do
people
have
to
do
when
they
take
oh
sit
in
a
corner
and
try
to
be
as
good
as
little
jack
horner
do
you
know
stella
it
strikes
me
that
you
are
more
spoilt
than
ever
i
suppose
it
comes
from
your
being
the
youngest
as
tom
it
is
awfully
good
of
you
to
make
excuses
for
me
said
stella
with
a
heightened
colour
was
popularly
credited
with
being
a
millionaire
certainly
the
surroundings
and
appointments
of
his
town
house
gave
colour
to
the
belief
not
to
mention
the
number
of
idle
servants
who
hung
about
the
place
just
like
an
english
nobleman
s
house
as
a
governor
from
one
of
the
adjacent
colonies
had
saying
which
some
of
friends
treasured
up
and
repeated
to
select
circles
of
their
friends
friends
basking
in
the
reflected
glory
of
a
viceregal
compliment
respecting
an
abode
in
which
they
were
so
much
at
home
as
for
herself
she
never
repeated
anything
that
savoured
of
indeed
one
would
imagine
at
times
that
wealth
was
quite
a
mortification
to
her
she
would
take
precautions
to
have
scores
upon
scores
of
callers
on
her
and
then
take
a
bosom
friend
aside
who
entirely
believed
in
her
and
had
an
incontinent
tongue
and
say
ah
my
dear
how
are
we
to
cultivate
our
minds
as
we
should
when
we
are
swallowed
up
in
social
maelstroms
like
this
and
so
when
she
donned
a
specially
magnificent
visiting
of
worth
s
highest
yet
chastening
the
possession
of
wealth
she
would
sit
in
a
remote
corner
of
her
carriage
with
a
melancholy
air
as
if
she
were
bowed
down
with
the
thought
that
all
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
and
then
in
talking
to
her
friends
at
such
times
the
words
our
terrible
climate
and
the
severe
limitations
of
colonial
life
were
often
on
her
lips
it
is
sordid
wealth
without
culture
or
the
traditions
of
refinement
that
stifles
our
artists
and
poets
she
would
murmur
as
if
shoals
of
such
gifted
beings
were
annually
offered
up
on
the
altar
of
fact
being
that
had
a
talent
for
assimilating
ideas
from
the
books
and
magazines
she
read
in
such
numbers
monthly
but
had
not
an
equal
felicity
in
their
application
the
thought
that
wealth
was
detrimental
to
mental
expansion
was
one
which
had
from
various
sources
become
dear
to
much
so
that
about
this
time
had
made
a
determined
effort
to
put
down
as
far
as
possible
the
overwhelming
power
of
money
in
melbourne
society
she
had
struggled
to
establish
a
weekly
gathering
to
be
open
only
to
people
of
culture
and
esprit
those
who
had
neither
asserted
that
the
line
must
certainly
be
drawn
at
but
habitués
of
the
salon
said
it
was
drawn
at
those
who
were
neither
amusing
nor
had
made
any
contribution
to
art
or
literature
but
then
a
liberal
interpretation
had
been
put
upon
the
latter
term
for
among
the
gifted
beings
at
the
first
reunion
was
a
wealthy
young
squatter
a
neighbour
of
ritchie
s
who
was
by
no
means
amusing
and
had
never
been
suspected
of
wandering
on
the
slopes
of
parnassus
on
inquiry
however
it
turned
out
that
a
year
previously
he
had
written
a
letter
to
the
melbourne
on
fluke
in
the
liver
of
the
at
which
stella
made
her
début
in
melbourne
society
as
laurette
grandiloquently
phrased
it
was
made
up
of
ten
women
in
all
supplemented
by
two
young
men
who
stole
furtive
glances
at
each
other
and
at
first
spoke
chiefly
in
monosyllables
according
to
the
hostess
one
was
a
poet
the
other
a
painter
stella
sat
at
right
hand
the
painter
at
her
left
some
funny
talk
went
on
about
allegory
well
vincent
i
still
think
that
your
first
idea
of
representing
australia
as
a
with
an
thrown
carelessly
over
her
shoulders
was
exquisite
said
that
may
be
dear
madame
found
that
this
was
the
title
by
which
young
souls
touched
with
the
sacred
fire
of
genius
and
therefore
admitted
to
the
salon
addressed
the
that
may
be
but
are
our
public
educated
up
to
the
point
of
reading
this
allegory
i
lay
it
down
as
one
of
the
canons
of
art
that
a
picture
must
tell
its
own
tale
now
the
tale
that
would
be
conveyed
by
the
figure
in
its
first
inception
would
be
that
it
was
not
australia
but
a
young
black
but
suppose
you
introduce
a
kangaroo
on
one
side
and
an
emu
on
the
other
there
would
be
two
objections
the
introduction
of
these
typical
animals
would
strengthen
the
aboriginal
theory
with
one
class
and
afford
an
element
of
mockery
to
of
mockery
surely
not
abandoned
as
our
newspaper
critics
may
alas
we
have
no
higher
standard
for
leading
the
masses
to
sweetness
and
would
never
dare
to
sully
with
their
profligate
satire
so
pure
and
original
a
conception
you
have
hit
the
very
point
that
is
exactly
what
they
would
do
madame
the
figure
of
a
young
female
inadequately
clad
with
a
kangaroo
on
one
side
and
a
nerveless
emu
on
the
other
suggests
nothing
so
much
as
an
exhibition
trophy
of
colonial
wine
and
olives
you
know
the
and
tone
of
newspaper
ah
you
have
so
much
penetration
such
marvellous
insight
into
the
envious
writhings
of
inferior
natures
murmured
gazing
at
her
painter
with
pensive
admiration
indeed
i
doubt
whether
the
very
strength
of
your
analytical
judgment
does
not
stand
in
your
way
as
a
great
creative
vincent
blushed
with
pleasure
but
still
maintained
a
gloomy
frown
as
became
an
artist
who
had
to
bear
the
burden
of
genius
in
a
world
beset
with
inappreciative
masses
and
unilluminated
critics
and
what
form
then
have
you
decided
on
finally
said
after
a
pause
she
had
always
a
lady
on
the
premises
who
took
the
more
prosaic
duties
of
a
hostess
and
so
left
her
full
scope
in
her
efforts
for
developing
the
less
material
forces
of
colonial
society
well
a
figure
more
after
the
classical
school
with
silken
drapery
gauzy
and
flowing
you
wished
to
say
something
does
it
not
strike
you
that
it
would
be
of
course
with
an
eye
to
the
untrained
masses
and
as
i
wish
to
make
a
gift
of
this
allegorical
figure
to
our
we
must
think
of
it
not
be
better
to
array
young
woman
in
a
product
of
colonial
growth
or
rather
manufacture
there
you
display
the
subtlety
of
the
born
critic
as
distinguished
from
those
who
exist
merely
because
they
get
so
much
per
column
for
squirting
muddy
water
but
unfortunately
our
manufactures
are
still
too
entirely
limited
to
the
more
fustian
uses
of
life
tweed
and
flannel
could
hardly
be
used
to
drape
a
lithe
young
female
whose
contour
must
show
but
we
grow
cotton
in
queensland
and
the
northern
yes
and
we
can
also
grow
silk
at
least
silkworms
and
mulberries
thrive
with
i
am
vanquished
vincent
i
have
not
another
word
to
say
the
silken
drapery
is
perfectly
but
still
as
silk
is
not
yet
one
of
our
established
industries
we
must
enhance
its
effect
by
something
characteristically
colonial
said
vincent
with
the
dispassionate
fairness
of
a
mind
too
broad
to
be
puffed
up
with
a
sense
of
its
own
critical
acumen
quite
true
the
is
very
typical
how
would
it
do
to
have
for
the
background
with
a
couple
of
sheep
nibbling
at
it
they
might
be
rather
lean
to
typify
that
this
bush
has
often
kept
our
flocks
from
if
i
were
painting
for
such
as
you
are
madame
my
task
would
be
an
easy
labour
of
love
i
should
say
for
on
the
day
on
which
i
can
not
feel
it
is
such
i
never
touch
a
brush
but
to
the
ignorant
on
the
one
hand
and
the
malicious
on
the
in
the
colonies
these
are
the
two
great
classes
for
whom
artists
say
to
these
the
sheep
would
be
a
the
one
would
think
and
the
other
would
say
without
thinking
that
the
young
woman
was
a
a
reminiscence
of
the
worst
rococo
period
of
unreal
landscapes
that
s
what
the
critic
with
a
little
wit
and
no
conscience
would
say
own
idea
after
long
and
i
may
say
painful
thought
is
to
paint
the
figure
with
a
garland
of
colonial
flowers
holding
a
basket
of
colonial
fruit
with
a
colonial
bird
on
her
shoulder
pecking
at
oh
really
too
exquisite
vincent
tell
me
what
flowers
and
what
bird
the
you
have
grapes
and
oranges
and
peaches
and
so
on
or
one
kind
i
do
not
know
about
grapes
the
colonial
wine
is
really
so
well
i
fear
i
am
fastidious
with
it
may
be
mentioned
that
vincent
usually
smoked
a
strong
cigar
over
his
wine
and
smacked
his
lips
ecstatically
when
he
gulped
british
champagne
made
of
unripe
gooseberries
yes
and
then
one
likes
to
encourage
teetotal
principles
among
the
masses
answered
perhaps
we
had
better
discard
the
grapes
and
the
flowers
well
i
don
t
know
the
names
of
any
colonial
flowers
but
i
must
ruralize
a
little
in
the
botanical
gardens
i
suppose
they
have
native
ones
there
no
doubt
oh
how
very
charming
and
natural
it
will
all
a
bush
idyll
now
about
the
see
i
am
all
impatience
well
i
thought
a
native
here
to
save
herself
from
absolute
disgrace
stella
dropped
her
napkin
so
as
to
have
an
excuse
for
stooping
and
hiding
her
face
for
a
moment
the
movement
drew
attention
to
her
neighbour
it
may
be
imagined
that
stella
had
listened
with
both
ears
to
all
that
had
passed
her
eyes
were
literally
dancing
with
suppressed
merriment
her
cheeks
glowing
like
a
peach
she
was
flanked
on
her
left
by
an
elderly
woman
who
was
rather
deaf
and
who
ate
her
way
stolidly
through
every
dish
on
the
so
that
the
girl
s
attention
had
been
undistracted
put
up
her
and
looked
at
her
admiringly
the
lady
had
very
good
eyesight
without
any
defect
of
over
long
or
short
sight
but
an
english
countess
who
had
visited
melbourne
and
stayed
some
days
at
toorak
house
had
always
put
up
her
when
she
wished
to
look
attentively
at
anything
being
so
that
objects
at
a
little
distance
were
all
blurred
and
indistinct
to
her
unaided
eyes
so
with
the
curious
humility
of
a
parvenu
had
ever
since
zealously
imitated
one
afflicted
with
impaired
vision
my
dear
young
lady
i
fear
you
are
not
eating
she
said
on
which
stella
answered
with
wreathed
smiles
that
she
had
been
so
very
much
interested
in
the
conversation
on
painting
etc
indeed
her
face
was
so
radiant
with
what
her
hostess
mentally
called
naïve
delight
that
she
instantly
took
a
liking
to
the
girl
you
are
perhaps
i
am
an
australian
answered
stella
who
had
to
keep
on
smiling
in
what
she
felt
was
an
imbecile
way
the
image
of
the
allegorical
figure
of
australia
with
a
native
companion
perched
on
her
shoulder
was
really
too
killing
you
make
a
distinction
then
between
colonial
and
australian
was
the
daughter
of
an
english
country
attorney
and
having
in
her
provincial
youth
been
familiarized
with
the
term
colonial
as
somehow
expressive
of
a
state
of
things
far
below
the
status
of
the
great
british
classes
she
still
clung
to
the
term
in
her
days
of
grandeur
fondly
deeming
that
it
somehow
marked
her
as
one
whose
was
more
aristocratic
than
could
fall
to
the
lot
of
those
who
were
born
and
bred
in
australia
surely
answered
stella
when
there
is
so
much
now
do
tell
me
how
you
see
i
came
to
the
colonies
only
when
i
married
i
believe
i
was
the
first
of
our
family
to
leave
there
was
a
vague
flourishing
emphasis
on
our
family
as
though
it
represented
great
territorial
magnates
well
a
it
not
suggest
a
handful
of
men
ploughing
scraps
of
land
in
an
insignificant
little
state
or
island
or
at
any
rate
the
first
scattered
handful
of
pioneers
who
have
an
uncertain
footing
in
an
alien
land
australia
is
not
a
colony
it
is
a
continent
a
great
country
where
generations
have
already
lived
and
birthplace
of
thousands
upon
thousands
who
love
it
more
dearly
than
any
other
spot
in
the
whole
the
light
of
patriotic
love
and
pride
shone
in
the
girl
s
eyes
and
her
voice
was
musical
with
deep
feeling
really
you
know
i
am
very
glad
to
have
this
explained
to
me
said
with
the
indefinite
awkwardness
of
one
who
has
unawares
awakened
a
chord
in
an
unknown
instrument
i
grant
you
though
stella
went
on
in
a
lighter
tone
half
piqued
at
herself
for
betraying
any
emotion
that
we
can
not
dispense
with
the
word
colonial
she
was
deeply
tempted
to
add
as
long
as
we
have
people
who
hang
idly
about
australian
cities
painting
foolish
pictures
for
money
that
should
be
better
well
you
heard
what
my
friend
vincent
said
tell
me
do
you
think
a
native
there
was
no
help
for
it
stella
had
to
laugh
dear
a
native
companion
is
much
larger
than
the
domestic
goose
and
is
mounted
on
legs
over
two
feet
high
with
a
neck
almost
as
long
as
its
ah
i
fear
it
would
not
do
then
to
perch
on
the
shoulder
of
an
allegorical
figure
of
australia
said
dropping
her
and
turning
to
the
artist
who
was
staring
at
stella
sombrely
as
if
he
suspected
her
of
inventing
the
dimensions
of
the
unfortunate
fowl
now
tell
me
miss
courtland
are
there
any
pretty
that
would
do
for
a
that
may
be
considered
nationally
australian
like
the
lily
for
france
and
the
rose
for
england
continued
this
enthusiastic
oh
yes
it
is
an
embarrassment
of
choice
to
go
no
further
than
the
exquisite
blossom
of
our
tan
wattles
the
white
scrub
immortelles
the
epacris
and
the
lovely
of
the
eucalyptus
cream
and
pink
have
you
ever
seen
the
curve
of
a
low
hillside
in
the
depths
of
our
woods
all
one
mass
of
and
and
scarlet
murmured
an
apologetic
negative
with
an
involuntary
glance
at
the
gorgeous
orchids
that
adorned
her
table
it
struck
her
perhaps
as
being
a
little
out
of
place
to
speak
with
so
much
enthusiasm
of
things
that
grew
in
masses
in
the
bush
to
one
who
could
command
such
rare
exotics
the
tan
wattle
is
of
rather
a
crude
and
violent
tint
said
vincent
in
a
tone
of
authority
i
can
imagine
that
it
would
very
easily
become
so
on
canvas
answered
stella
with
a
sweet
smile
which
quite
confirmed
in
her
first
estimate
of
the
young
lady
as
being
delightfully
naïve
you
it
is
to
be
feared
she
would
have
changed
her
opinion
if
she
had
overheard
stella
that
night
describe
to
ted
the
accessories
of
an
allegorical
australia
that
had
been
evolved
in
her
hearing
by
a
colonial
painter
and
his
patroness
xxii
stella
was
still
sitting
over
a
late
breakfast
with
laurette
when
her
brother
called
with
his
having
driven
dora
from
her
father
s
house
in
the
family
he
watched
the
first
greetings
between
the
girls
with
keen
pleasure
dora
was
very
pretty
fair
and
mignonne
with
hair
in
crisp
wavelets
a
pure
english
complexion
and
large
blue
eyes
that
had
something
of
the
expression
of
a
child
s
who
has
suddenly
been
told
a
pleasant
piece
of
news
oh
you
are
a
sweet
little
darling
no
wonder
cuthbert
has
thrown
me
over
for
you
said
stella
looking
at
her
critically
but
cuthbert
has
not
thrown
you
over
dear
stella
he
has
given
you
one
more
sister
to
do
they
teach
each
other
what
to
say
already
thought
stella
they
babbled
away
pleasantly
for
some
little
time
going
over
those
reminiscences
and
simple
personalities
in
which
old
ladies
and
lovers
so
readily
indulge
presently
laurette
joined
them
and
the
talk
became
more
general
the
plan
was
that
stella
should
spend
the
day
and
stay
the
night
at
the
carters
cuthbert
was
preparing
to
go
having
parochial
work
when
ted
rode
up
to
monico
lodge
followed
by
a
groom
leading
shah
for
stella
to
ride
the
discovery
seemed
to
have
something
of
the
nature
of
a
sensation
to
dora
when
after
she
and
ted
were
introduced
he
said
why
stella
i
thought
i
would
find
you
ready
shah
is
in
fine
form
for
you
you
have
appointed
to
go
out
riding
cuthbert
said
a
little
coldly
to
his
sister
you
see
i
had
no
idea
that
you
children
would
be
so
good
and
kind
as
to
come
so
early
i
am
sorry
ted
but
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
ride
this
ted
s
brow
darkened
visibly
but
that
s
nonsense
stella
he
said
impatiently
if
you
haven
t
finished
your
jabber
i
can
cuthbert
s
face
became
more
and
more
impassive
dora
looked
from
cuthbert
to
stella
in
a
mystified
way
and
then
laurette
came
to
the
rescue
proposing
that
she
should
drive
back
with
dora
she
wanted
to
see
dear
carter
so
much
they
could
take
stella
s
and
maid
and
then
ted
would
take
stella
direct
to
the
parsonage
that
s
the
very
ticket
said
ted
go
on
stella
see
if
you
can
t
get
ready
in
five
minutes
and
he
pulled
his
watch
out
and
stella
without
further
ado
hastened
to
obey
incredible
as
it
was
to
cuthbert
this
rather
illiterate
and
overbearing
young
man
seemed
destined
to
triumph
in
his
suit
his
heart
sank
strangely
at
the
thought
he
left
for
town
before
stella
reappeared
and
when
they
met
again
at
the
parsonage
in
the
evening
he
knew
by
the
wistful
droop
of
his
sister
s
mouth
that
she
had
somehow
felt
bored
to
death
bored
in
this
exquisitely
refined
christian
home
and
yet
tolerant
of
ritchie
as
a
lover
poor
stella
she
had
indeed
passed
through
some
evil
hours
that
day
in
the
first
place
the
seaside
and
shah
the
blue
serenity
of
the
day
the
great
measureless
crescendo
of
the
waves
and
ted
s
touching
goodness
in
entirely
keeping
off
forbidden
ground
had
beguiled
her
into
prolonging
her
ride
beyond
what
she
intended
the
moment
she
entered
the
house
she
became
aware
that
lunch
had
been
kept
back
on
her
account
there
are
some
households
in
which
unpunctuality
is
made
into
one
of
the
seven
deadly
sins
and
it
seemed
this
was
one
of
them
there
were
three
daughters
older
than
dora
and
it
transpired
that
the
day
was
for
all
with
set
duties
for
each
hour
so
that
when
thirty
minutes
were
lost
in
waiting
for
a
guest
who
was
inexcusably
late
the
rest
of
the
day
threatened
to
resolve
itself
into
a
scramble
to
make
up
for
lost
time
and
wasted
opportunities
the
rev
carter
and
the
two
eldest
daughters
had
to
excuse
themselves
and
hurry
away
before
the
meal
was
over
in
order
to
catch
a
certain
train
to
one
of
the
suburbs
where
a
sale
of
gifts
in
aid
of
a
church
school
had
to
be
opened
directly
after
their
departure
a
friend
called
by
appointment
to
accompany
the
third
daughter
on
a
periodical
visit
to
an
orphanage
and
thus
silence
prevailed
for
a
little
which
stella
endeavoured
to
break
by
saying
i
feel
most
awfully
guilty
you
know
but
the
sea
was
too
divine
and
the
you
noticed
dora
how
widely
vaulted
it
is
oh
yes
very
pretty
answered
dora
with
a
faint
smile
and
stella
resolved
for
the
hundredth
time
since
she
left
home
that
she
would
not
try
to
drag
the
things
that
captivated
her
so
insanely
into
conversation
it
was
like
offering
people
coin
for
which
they
had
no
change
cuthbert
did
not
mention
you
were
engaged
said
carter
when
they
had
settled
themselves
in
the
each
with
some
form
of
needlework
oh
but
i
am
not
answered
stella
and
then
mother
and
daughter
exchanged
a
quick
look
and
dora
colouring
very
prettily
said
i
thought
dear
ritchie
calling
you
stella
and
your
going
out
it
certainly
behoved
stella
to
explain
the
friendship
or
at
any
rate
acquaintanceship
which
had
established
both
customs
but
she
was
little
in
the
habit
of
apologizing
for
herself
and
partly
through
indifference
partly
out
of
perversity
she
allowed
the
subject
to
drop
not
so
carter
however
who
found
a
roundabout
way
of
approaching
the
subject
again
tareling
was
ritchie
s
sister
then
what
a
very
brilliant
marriage
she
had
made
stella
opened
her
eyes
wide
in
surprise
of
course
the
younger
son
of
a
british
peer
was
considered
so
in
the
colonies
carter
presumed
no
doubt
you
knew
her
before
she
married
ah
yes
they
knew
each
other
since
they
were
children
and
ritchie
the
young
man
was
one
of
those
who
had
so
many
sheep
and
cattle
and
things
stella
believed
he
had
over
fifteen
thousand
a
year
on
hearing
this
carter
sat
more
upright
and
regarded
stella
with
new
and
respectful
interest
and
then
the
lady
slid
into
a
long
and
tedious
account
of
her
own
family
it
was
rather
involved
or
else
stella
s
attention
wandered
for
at
the
close
she
was
not
certain
whether
it
was
carter
herself
or
her
mother
or
her
grandmother
who
had
been
governess
to
an
english
princess
of
the
royal
family
it
was
clear
however
that
they
belonged
to
a
good
family
that
they
had
been
much
reduced
that
those
who
had
married
had
espoused
rising
clergymen
one
sister
was
married
to
a
bishop
poor
woman
thought
stella
carter
seemed
to
pause
as
if
for
some
expression
of
awe
or
admiration
when
she
found
this
was
not
forthcoming
she
went
on
to
explain
how
wide
was
the
gulf
fixed
between
a
colonial
and
an
english
bishop
the
carters
were
only
temporarily
in
melbourne
and
proposed
to
return
to
england
at
no
distant
date
there
was
money
in
carter
s
family
one
of
his
nieces
was
married
to
the
first
cousin
of
a
great
duke
stella
lost
herself
in
calculating
what
share
of
lustre
this
connection
with
the
british
aristocracy
shed
on
her
brother
when
she
emerged
from
this
depth
carter
was
dilating
on
the
pang
it
would
cost
them
to
part
with
dear
dora
but
cuthbert
was
all
they
could
have
wished
they
had
every
confidence
in
him
etc
it
seemed
to
stella
that
the
good
lady
was
applying
the
phrases
of
a
governess
s
testimonial
to
her
brother
yes
decidedly
it
must
have
been
carter
herself
who
had
held
brevet
rank
as
a
governess
she
placed
so
tiresome
and
so
didactic
an
emphasis
on
the
less
alluring
aspects
of
life
coupled
with
an
implication
of
having
been
since
early
childhood
engaged
in
laying
the
moral
groundwork
of
society
then
in
the
midst
of
this
gentle
consequential
purring
she
suddenly
asked
stella
whether
young
ladies
in
the
who
had
been
born
in
them
and
had
never
lived
more
after
the
american
stamp
than
the
english
the
question
somewhat
revived
stella
s
drooping
spirits
it
opened
the
door
for
a
frankly
mischievous
sketch
of
her
own
existence
at
fairacre
the
the
calls
the
the
walks
with
the
children
the
rides
with
her
brother
but
not
the
remotest
allusion
to
what
she
knew
had
been
chiefly
in
carter
s
mind
not
a
whisper
of
platonic
friendship
or
suitors
one
might
imagine
from
stella
s
easy
rapid
sketch
that
a
colonial
girl
was
like
the
angels
in
heaven
and
never
even
remotely
glanced
at
the
question
of
marrying
there
were
visitors
and
afternoon
but
both
of
a
very
mild
not
to
say
tepid
character
dull
people
do
not
understand
the
grateful
fillip
that
the
beverage
when
quite
fresh
and
fragrant
gives
to
the
spirits
and
imagination
nor
did
matters
improve
much
when
the
rest
of
the
family
returned
when
they
were
all
together
the
atmosphere
was
pervaded
with
snatches
of
ruined
extracts
from
the
careers
of
reprobates
of
both
sexes
something
had
always
happened
which
was
too
shocking
to
be
gone
into
either
a
mangle
or
a
daughter
seemed
to
have
disappeared
clandestinely
from
most
of
the
poor
houses
they
had
recently
visited
stella
listened
in
vain
for
some
touch
of
fun
or
genuine
that
these
poor
people
had
said
which
would
throw
an
illuminating
ray
on
what
they
really
thought
or
endured
but
no
if
anything
was
repeated
that
had
been
said
by
the
fatherless
or
the
widow
or
the
backslider
it
had
a
chilling
echo
to
her
of
conventional
the
kind
of
the
needy
catch
up
so
readily
with
alms
given
on
condition
that
they
repent
or
it
was
still
more
like
what
one
of
the
middle
classes
might
have
said
after
being
led
astray
and
made
decorously
repentant
by
the
pangs
of
hunger
there
are
multitudes
who
all
their
lives
visit
the
poor
without
ever
catching
a
true
lineament
of
their
minds
such
people
are
often
suffused
with
an
hysterical
kind
of
earnestness
which
makes
them
utterly
impervious
to
any
true
apprehension
of
what
is
going
on
in
the
minds
of
others
or
they
are
swaddled
in
a
complacent
egoism
which
makes
them
quite
invulnerable
to
any
true
appreciation
of
the
bearings
of
life
they
are
capable
only
of
one
standpoint
and
this
one
is
all
distorted
and
awry
you
do
not
look
very
much
entertained
stella
said
her
brother
when
he
found
an
opportunity
shortly
before
he
left
of
speaking
to
her
alone
no
it
must
be
the
ravages
of
a
troubled
conscience
you
notice
shah
was
too
dear
this
morning
i
kept
the
whole
household
waiting
for
me
and
must
notice
that
the
eldest
miss
carter
sings
methodically
out
of
tune
or
don
t
people
mind
such
trifles
when
they
are
in
love
cuthbert
flushed
hotly
he
was
indeed
very
much
in
love
and
this
coupled
with
the
conviction
that
his
sister
had
decided
to
accept
ritchie
s
devotion
made
him
a
moment
angry
even
like
other
angry
people
he
took
up
the
first
weapon
that
came
to
hand
perhaps
the
charms
of
ritchie
s
society
make
you
impatient
of
ordinary
intercourse
he
said
almost
sternly
stella
looked
at
him
with
startled
dilating
eyes
it
was
almost
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
cuthbert
had
spoken
and
looked
at
her
unkindly
she
felt
it
like
a
stab
but
she
strove
to
conceal
all
appearance
of
being
hurt
i
dare
say
she
answered
smiling
you
see
we
australians
understand
one
another
we
have
a
wicked
love
of
enjoyment
of
horses
and
sunshine
and
the
seashore
did
you
hear
that
ted
has
a
new
bay
colt
which
has
twice
covered
a
mile
in
an
incredibly
short
time
no
i
have
never
been
much
interested
in
the
performances
of
horses
as
you
well
it
has
an
amusing
side
ted
is
always
pursued
by
a
trainer
or
a
jockey
or
a
man
in
a
funny
necktie
who
is
dying
to
buy
the
little
brown
filly
out
of
lady
glendora
by
victor
you
i
never
believed
till
now
that
you
would
end
by
accepting
him
stella
it
seems
to
me
little
short
of
an
but
do
you
know
my
dear
that
there
are
women
who
marry
even
bishops
was
it
perversity
or
the
outcome
of
some
nascent
feeling
of
a
deeper
nature
than
even
she
herself
was
aware
of
which
led
the
young
woman
to
answer
her
brother
s
remonstrances
with
so
much
reserve
that
a
sudden
change
in
her
real
attitude
towards
ted
would
not
have
seemed
inconsistent
perhaps
there
was
something
of
both
motives
nevertheless
the
chief
one
which
made
these
long
morning
rides
so
precious
to
her
was
a
passionate
love
of
being
in
the
open
air
of
riding
of
getting
away
from
people
who
were
more
or
less
herself
at
times
most
of
all
on
horseback
more
completely
than
anywhere
else
she
threw
every
haunting
shape
of
troubled
thought
to
the
winds
life
then
became
a
glorious
glad
bounding
motion
in
which
simply
to
be
was
enough
without
any
foolish
looking
before
and
after
that
night
before
she
fell
asleep
stella
recalled
her
brother
s
face
and
words
in
the
brief
conversation
that
had
passed
and
she
felt
her
heart
failing
her
in
a
curious
way
it
is
true
she
thought
the
chief
attachment
of
my
life
is
crumbling
away
as
long
as
i
was
first
with
cuthbert
he
did
not
see
what
a
faulty
foolish
inconsistent
creature
i
am
dora
s
placid
little
perfections
show
me
up
in
a
lurid
light
after
this
he
can
not
see
me
without
criticising
wondering
how
at
one
time
i
seemed
to
him
so
dear
and
lovable
and
shall
always
be
conscious
of
it
and
always
say
horrid
things
oh
it
is
no
use
my
drawing
out
a
little
set
of
rules
resolving
to
be
more
gentle
and
sweet
and
patient
the
things
i
say
for
which
i
afterwards
hate
myself
come
to
me
with
handles
is
this
a
dagger
that
i
see
before
me
no
it
is
a
stupid
little
bodkin
that
generally
contrives
to
scratch
me
i
seem
to
have
got
to
that
stage
of
life
in
which
i
must
take
myself
for
better
or
worse
as
people
do
in
mostly
for
worse
perhaps
when
the
glow
of
courtship
and
the
honeymoon
are
over
cuthbert
may
cease
to
criticise
that
is
too
far
away
to
be
consoling
i
have
the
unfortunate
australian
temperament
i
want
the
share
that
falleth
to
my
lot
now
and
then
there
will
be
not
only
dora
whose
eyes
get
rounder
at
everything
i
say
but
there
will
be
an
elder
sister
eternally
singing
out
of
a
little
song
with
a
moral
in
its
tail
to
sing
at
a
servantmaids
friendly
association
poor
things
it
is
no
wonder
they
disappear
like
the
mangles
that
are
bought
with
subscriptions
after
all
shah
and
ted
are
less
objectionable
than
many
things
in
she
mocked
herself
as
she
habitually
did
when
she
was
bent
on
keeping
sterner
more
serious
thoughts
at
a
distance
yet
before
she
fell
asleep
her
pillow
was
wet
with
tears
in
the
days
that
followed
the
brother
and
sister
gradually
drifted
apart
he
was
constantly
with
the
carters
and
their
friends
during
his
hours
of
relaxation
from
parochial
work
stella
swayed
by
a
variety
of
motives
conceived
almost
a
horror
of
the
carter
household
she
even
repented
of
having
called
dora
a
little
darling
at
their
first
interview
she
described
her
to
ted
as
opening
her
eyes
wide
like
an
automatic
doll
you
don
t
like
having
your
nose
put
out
of
joint
i
can
see
that
answered
ted
with
an
amused
chuckle
stella
made
a
slight
grimace
at
him
and
gave
shah
his
head
as
they
were
trotting
up
the
toorak
road
ted
spoke
again
you
see
stella
that
s
one
strong
point
about
me
i
ll
never
throw
you
over
for
oh
for
the
matter
of
that
cuth
hasn
t
only
he
s
got
engaged
to
the
wrong
sort
of
family
when
you
get
engaged
ted
please
see
that
the
lady
you
love
has
not
three
unmarried
eldest
desperately
unmusical
but
bent
on
well
you
see
the
lady
i
love
has
only
one
unmarried
sister
but
of
course
you
had
that
in
your
mind
when
you
spoke
said
ted
smiling
to
himself
under
his
moustache
stella
laughed
merrily
at
the
imputation
now
confess
said
ted
as
they
slackened
their
horses
pace
and
dropped
into
a
walk
you
would
be
horribly
cross
if
i
came
morning
and
said
i
had
got
engaged
and
instead
of
begging
you
to
ride
shah
took
out
the
other
young
xxiii
next
morning
the
rain
came
down
in
torrents
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
go
out
riding
nor
could
ted
make
an
appointment
for
the
afternoon
in
case
it
cleared
had
formed
one
of
those
sudden
attachments
for
miss
courtland
which
characterized
the
melbourne
lady
s
social
career
already
in
writing
to
stella
she
addressed
her
as
an
ever
dear
and
this
was
the
day
on
which
the
new
ever
dear
was
to
be
at
toorak
house
at
twelve
o
clock
and
spend
a
quiet
evening
with
a
few
special
friends
that
means
the
people
who
have
souls
and
pens
stella
said
laurette
mrs
always
reads
people
s
characters
at
a
glance
she
quite
took
you
in
the
first
day
you
are
so
sweet
and
fresh
and
open
to
new
ideas
fancy
my
listening
to
all
this
without
betraying
you
by
jove
you
women
are
a
rum
lot
broke
in
ted
who
stood
staring
out
through
the
window
beating
a
tattoo
on
his
boot
with
a
thank
you
dear
said
laurette
with
a
pert
little
bow
yes
here
s
that
hobbs
woman
flying
at
stella
with
both
arms
when
they
meet
and
stella
going
for
all
the
day
and
most
of
the
night
with
her
and
then
i
ll
swear
she
ll
have
some
comic
story
when
she
comes
back
like
that
one
about
the
lean
sheep
and
the
mallee
and
the
native
laurette
looked
thoroughly
mystified
though
stella
dearly
loved
to
tell
a
funny
story
she
was
very
careful
not
to
make
a
confidante
of
one
with
so
slippery
a
tongue
as
laurette
s
ted
perceived
the
situation
and
his
heart
beat
with
joy
stella
was
sitting
on
a
low
near
the
fire
cutting
the
leaves
of
a
magazine
ted
sat
down
on
the
at
her
feet
and
said
in
an
undertone
after
all
what
you
told
me
in
the
top
of
the
so
many
years
ago
is
quite
oh
as
for
she
gives
herself
away
to
everyone
said
laurette
viciously
there
had
been
an
ardent
friendship
at
one
time
between
the
two
which
had
long
since
been
offered
up
as
alms
to
oblivion
and
laurette
suspected
that
had
confided
some
story
to
stella
under
the
bond
of
secrecy
there
was
that
absurd
story
about
herself
and
the
russian
commander
last
season
oh
i
mean
when
the
russian
was
here
of
course
gave
a
grand
ball
and
s
her
forgot
himself
she
was
so
mortified
she
began
to
speak
to
the
commander
in
a
and
a
broken
voice
of
the
withering
bonds
of
the
conjugal
life
just
merely
to
show
off
how
sensitive
and
refined
she
was
she
didn
t
mean
a
word
of
it
you
know
the
commander
thought
she
was
proposing
to
elope
with
him
and
explained
in
fragmentary
english
that
his
official
position
would
not
permit
any
irregularity
but
that
he
hoped
to
return
before
really
laurette
i
don
t
think
you
should
tell
a
story
like
that
before
me
said
ted
who
was
engaged
in
trying
to
purloin
a
bow
of
ribbon
off
stella
s
shoe
and
then
the
way
she
dresses
said
laurette
who
like
many
others
found
it
difficult
to
curb
her
enthusiasm
as
soon
as
she
had
begun
discussing
an
absent
friend
you
noticed
her
the
other
evening
at
government
house
arrayed
in
an
extraordinary
with
yellow
marabout
feathers
on
the
train
she
reads
the
court
circular
you
know
and
makes
a
point
of
dressing
like
a
young
forgetting
she
is
getting
on
in
life
and
never
had
a
if
you
say
much
more
i
shall
stay
to
see
you
hugging
and
kissing
her
when
she
comes
in
said
ted
slipping
a
knot
of
crimson
satin
ribbon
into
his
vest
pocket
that
reminds
me
i
must
write
a
note
or
two
before
i
go
said
stella
one
of
these
was
to
louise
her
brother
hector
s
wife
at
lullaboolagana
you
say
you
are
not
very
well
and
are
longing
to
see
me
she
wrote
well
if
you
write
in
your
answer
i
want
you
at
once
you
will
see
me
hours
after
i
get
it
i
feel
an
ungrateful
laurette
is
all
kindness
in
her
the
mallee
scrub
spoils
one
for
the
kind
of
society
in
which
money
is
the
one
great
distinction
and
where
women
have
no
time
for
anything
but
to
be
insignificant
victims
of
those
sinister
successes
of
life
which
end
in
choking
it
with
superfluities
as
for
me
little
dimple
of
dora
s
pretty
face
is
worth
all
i
am
or
can
be
yes
this
is
partly
mean
sort
of
reptile
which
i
used
to
think
i
was
quite
above
i
suppose
we
are
above
most
failings
as
long
as
there
is
no
well
ted
said
his
sister
when
the
two
were
alone
it
seems
to
me
that
you
and
stella
are
getting
laurette
did
not
really
think
so
but
money
affairs
were
day
by
day
assuming
a
sterner
aspect
and
she
was
anxious
to
make
belief
in
the
success
of
ted
s
suit
a
ground
for
making
sacrifices
on
his
behalf
laurette
s
ideal
of
a
sacrifice
was
making
someone
pay
very
heavily
for
an
action
that
had
cost
her
nothing
oh
do
you
think
so
answered
ritchie
then
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
for
a
little
look
here
larry
he
said
suddenly
do
you
think
stella
has
heard
anything
laurette
was
just
then
like
a
who
discards
nothing
that
comes
to
hand
till
it
is
examined
at
leisure
i
do
not
know
she
answered
slowly
what
makes
you
ask
well
at
times
she
is
so
merry
and
full
of
fun
then
she
gets
a
silent
fit
and
though
we
are
friendly
we
never
seem
to
get
any
further
the
more
i
see
of
her
the
less
i
know
what
is
going
to
she
doesn
t
know
herself
stella
courtland
is
one
of
those
girls
who
seem
to
be
wise
and
even
all
the
time
she
is
torn
in
twenty
directions
it
runs
all
through
her
at
seventeen
she
wouldn
t
be
confirmed
because
she
wanted
to
be
a
catholic
she
has
never
been
confirmed
to
this
day
and
never
turned
catholic
she
stays
away
from
church
far
more
than
i
do
and
yet
she
ll
read
her
bible
by
the
hour
as
if
it
were
a
french
novel
she
scoffs
at
people
thinking
they
can
do
any
good
to
the
poor
and
still
she
has
a
trick
of
going
to
see
them
and
listening
to
everything
they
choose
to
say
far
more
patiently
than
she
would
to
you
or
me
she
has
been
absurdly
fond
of
her
brother
cuthbert
all
her
life
and
instead
of
being
glad
he
has
got
engaged
to
a
pretty
girl
she
mopes
over
it
i
have
no
doubt
she
thinks
in
her
heart
that
i
am
a
very
poor
shallow
creature
but
at
any
rate
i
know
what
i
want
and
i
generally
succeed
in
getting
it
and
for
once
i
change
my
mind
she
changes
hers
fifty
times
let
her
go
on
a
little
longer
and
if
the
whim
should
take
her
in
the
end
that
she
doesn
t
care
to
marry
you
i
think
i
can
bring
her
to
her
bearings
it
used
to
be
a
great
weakness
with
her
even
as
a
girl
to
believe
she
could
do
good
it
s
a
sort
of
family
superstition
she
may
not
have
it
very
strong
now
but
still
enough
to
get
at
her
through
her
through
her
conscience
repeated
ritchie
as
though
in
the
case
of
a
woman
this
were
a
theological
abstraction
not
to
be
lightly
brought
up
in
secular
conversation
yes
precisely
returned
laurette
with
a
firm
voice
conscience
was
on
the
whole
the
mental
faculty
of
which
she
knew
least
and
she
felt
therefore
all
the
better
qualified
to
reckon
on
its
mystic
influence
with
a
character
so
unstable
but
after
giving
you
so
much
encouragement
she
ll
never
finally
reject
well
as
to
the
encouragement
larry
it
s
more
that
i
won
t
give
in
you
take
no
for
an
then
don
t
be
impatient
the
longer
you
are
thrown
together
in
this
sort
of
way
the
better
for
when
stella
came
back
from
that
evening
she
found
laurette
looking
very
much
discomposed
over
a
telegram
that
awaited
her
return
from
a
musical
evening
at
sir
thomas
and
lady
danby
s
who
were
neighbours
at
monico
lodge
she
said
nothing
however
as
to
the
cause
of
her
evident
vexation
but
chatted
about
the
events
of
the
day
until
ted
came
in
he
launched
into
details
of
a
dinner
that
had
been
given
at
the
melbourne
club
to
colonel
aldersley
prior
to
his
departure
for
england
there
was
little
jingo
of
wyoming
he
said
laying
it
on
as
usual
with
a
trowel
the
presence
of
men
like
colonel
aldersley
amongst
us
says
he
has
more
than
social
significance
it
is
the
influence
of
such
people
that
rivets
the
bonds
that
bind
us
to
the
and
a
lot
more
i
can
t
remember
and
there
was
the
colonel
trying
to
look
as
if
he
believed
it
and
the
other
fellows
jogging
each
other
and
little
eardley
brat
of
a
boy
of
eighteen
who
has
lost
over
to
the
himself
to
see
if
he
was
stella
was
much
diverted
by
this
but
laurette
her
telegram
with
a
face
then
she
left
the
room
saying
she
would
be
back
in
a
few
minutes
on
this
ted
entered
into
more
personal
talk
i
say
stella
what
do
you
call
that
dress
you
have
mean
what
stuff
is
it
crêpe
de
pink
as
you
see
and
that
stuff
peeping
out
round
your
shoulders
crêpe
would
you
mind
being
married
just
in
a
dress
like
that
why
ted
that
s
like
fishing
for
an
invitation
nothing
of
the
sort
who
ever
heard
of
a
bridegroom
asking
to
be
invited
now
stella
don
t
move
sit
just
as
you
are
and
what
are
these
roses
in
your
hair
and
bosom
scarlet
fairy
roses
aren
t
they
too
dear
and
sweet
still
has
heaps
of
them
though
they
were
nearly
over
with
us
when
i
left
tell
me
about
before
larry
comes
back
i
won
t
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
on
you
this
time
stella
was
sitting
on
her
favourite
chair
near
the
fire
the
flames
leaped
rosily
and
cast
rosy
reflections
on
her
to
it
on
each
side
of
the
japanese
screen
with
its
flock
of
storks
hovering
above
their
slender
bamboos
ritchie
had
planted
himself
straight
in
front
of
her
sitting
horseback
fashion
on
a
chair
his
hands
which
were
crossed
on
the
back
of
it
supporting
his
chin
at
this
request
stella
began
to
laugh
and
her
eyes
sparkled
with
amusement
it
was
the
expression
that
her
companion
best
loved
to
see
her
wear
when
she
looked
like
that
he
always
understood
what
she
said
oh
the
salon
ted
it
was
really
too
funny
you
must
know
that
after
dinner
we
assembled
in
what
calls
her
boudoir
but
it
is
as
large
as
any
ordinary
it
is
hung
with
panels
of
satin
very
beautifully
with
graces
and
cupids
tumbling
over
wreaths
of
roses
but
the
design
i
liked
best
was
a
great
spray
of
double
white
with
a
pair
of
sweet
little
gray
billing
in
the
yes
they
re
jolly
little
animals
i
wish
some
people
would
take
a
little
more
after
now
if
you
interrupt
i
must
remember
bow
late
it
is
perhaps
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
this
work
was
done
by
a
russian
countess
that
met
abroad
she
got
into
trouble
with
her
husband
or
the
government
or
something
so
one
night
instead
of
returning
home
from
a
ball
she
ran
away
to
the
riviera
where
she
designed
and
worked
lovely
things
for
people
who
have
two
hundred
thousand
sheep
in
the
woods
of
australia
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
there
is
something
that
fascinates
the
mind
in
the
idea
of
eloping
with
a
from
the
reach
of
the
police
or
an
objectionable
nonsense
stella
no
woman
worth
her
salt
runs
away
from
her
husband
like
that
answered
ted
promptly
he
may
have
had
reasons
of
his
own
for
entertaining
strict
views
on
this
point
besides
if
you
knew
all
you
may
depend
it
was
not
with
a
she
well
at
any
rate
it
was
with
a
she
lived
and
she
was
known
as
the
countess
olga
but
where
was
i
oh
the
you
must
figure
to
yourself
that
was
draped
in
a
wonderful
indian
fabric
and
that
she
lived
in
an
enormous
armchair
covered
with
velvet
beside
her
was
a
little
octagon
table
carved
out
of
angola
ivory
on
it
the
daintiest
little
notebook
in
the
world
with
jewelled
notebook
in
which
to
enter
the
of
the
what
are
have
i
ever
heard
any
oh
ted
think
that
i
climbed
trees
with
you
in
my
infancy
and
have
seen
you
at
intervals
ever
since
and
that
you
should
ask
such
a
question
how
shall
i
must
be
in
the
concrete
you
remember
the
last
time
you
were
out
riding
you
told
me
of
an
oxford
man
who
was
a
at
strathhaye
for
some
time
and
how
speaking
of
the
old
greeks
once
he
said
their
only
idea
of
trade
was
piracy
and
i
answered
it
remained
for
modern
times
to
combine
the
two
well
that
was
something
in
the
nature
of
a
oh
you
are
always
saying
things
of
that
kind
but
why
the
dickens
should
the
old
frump
want
to
put
them
in
a
notebook
why
indeed
answered
stella
laughing
heartily
well
you
see
ted
the
prosperity
of
a
salon
depends
on
its
i
am
obliged
to
confess
i
did
not
hear
any
there
were
twenty
of
us
and
the
first
part
of
the
evening
was
monopolized
by
a
yankee
who
sends
columns
of
lies
every
week
to
a
daily
paper
in
new
york
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
held
forth
through
his
nose
for
nearly
an
hour
on
the
merits
of
cremation
he
proved
conclusively
that
a
casket
ten
inches
by
eight
would
contain
the
calcined
ashes
of
an
adult
and
then
he
asked
the
host
in
an
audible
aside
for
a
nip
of
dog
s
nose
what
in
the
world
is
that
it
was
now
ted
s
turn
to
laugh
why
it
s
a
horrid
mess
made
of
gin
and
beer
then
that
accounts
for
confusion
she
told
me
beforehand
that
in
striving
to
establish
a
d
she
was
determined
to
keep
the
grosser
pleasures
of
the
palate
in
the
have
nothing
more
material
than
macaroons
and
lemonade
i
think
hobbs
himself
went
to
brew
the
unholy
mixture
i
am
sure
he
would
not
dare
to
ask
it
from
the
butler
who
is
a
magnificent
creature
whose
former
life
has
been
passed
in
the
bosom
of
the
british
nobility
what
can
be
keeping
laurette
so
long
oh
i
dare
say
the
kiddies
have
got
measles
or
something
answered
ted
go
on
stella
tell
me
some
more
were
there
many
to
dinner
yes
about
a
dozen
these
endless
costly
dinners
are
my
horror
i
like
my
food
plain
and
unmixed
like
a
bird
or
a
peasant
on
one
side
of
me
there
was
a
woman
who
seemed
to
be
in
a
state
of
nervous
tension
about
her
spoons
and
forks
on
the
other
a
man
hardly
who
gobbled
away
till
the
veins
on
his
forehead
stood
out
pastor
fiedler
s
nine
little
pigs
used
to
dine
much
more
peacefully
and
then
their
grunts
were
so
much
more
eloquent
than
anything
he
i
ve
been
to
toorak
house
a
few
times
said
ted
laughing
it
always
seemed
crammed
up
with
things
from
oh
yes
i
should
think
that
temples
in
the
far
east
must
have
been
rifled
for
screens
and
rugs
and
there
are
some
things
i
have
quite
fallen
in
love
with
one
is
a
very
old
egyptian
in
the
shape
of
a
another
is
a
slender
etrurian
vase
in
jade
but
how
late
it
is
she
cried
suddenly
laurette
must
be
seeing
the
children
through
all
the
phases
of
a
lingering
malady
but
he
did
not
release
her
hand
oh
stella
if
you
would
let
me
take
one
one
you
did
once
before
you
know
when
we
were
afternoon
in
the
garden
at
she
drew
back
but
he
had
taken
both
her
hands
and
held
them
firmly
in
his
let
me
go
at
once
ted
she
cried
in
quick
anger
and
something
of
dismay
stella
when
is
this
to
come
to
an
end
how
long
am
i
to
wait
and
beg
and
play
the
fool
have
pity
on
me
you
do
like
me
a
little
that
s
all
i
want
to
begin
with
you
have
thought
that
you
might
marry
me
you
must
have
thought
that
you
would
let
me
kiss
you
there
don
t
look
as
if
i
frightened
you
try
and
make
up
your
i
have
made
up
my
mind
she
cried
sweeping
past
him
an
indignant
flush
on
her
face
it
was
nearly
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
she
found
maisie
fast
asleep
in
the
where
she
had
been
waiting
her
mistress
s
return
stella
made
her
go
to
bed
at
once
but
she
herself
sat
in
a
by
her
bedroom
fire
she
was
angry
first
at
ted
and
then
herself
it
was
ridiculous
of
her
to
sit
and
talk
with
him
so
long
laurette
was
a
sneak
who
had
no
doubt
purposely
stayed
away
even
chaperons
had
not
been
invented
without
a
cause
probably
the
most
jaded
institutions
of
society
were
founded
upon
some
battered
relic
of
reason
but
was
it
necessary
to
run
full
tilt
against
them
before
acknowledging
this
how
absurd
it
was
getting
this
determined
endless
wooing
what
would
be
the
end
of
it
her
anger
died
away
as
she
tried
to
answer
the
question
she
could
not
pretend
to
dislike
ted
she
reflected
on
the
endless
variation
of
dulness
that
entered
so
largely
into
the
lives
of
the
bulk
of
women
after
all
money
was
one
of
the
greatest
safeguards
against
that
mildew
of
unexpectant
monotony
with
which
the
years
were
so
largely
infected
when
once
one
began
to
find
things
out
she
was
really
beginning
to
feel
as
if
ted
had
a
right
to
her
finally
she
resolved
that
she
would
hasten
her
departure
for
lullaboolagana
and
there
make
a
final
an
irrevocable
decision
then
she
pictured
herself
writing
to
ted
no
she
would
see
him
it
would
be
kinder
she
would
ask
him
to
meet
her
in
melbourne
on
her
way
back
ted
this
must
come
to
an
end
you
must
take
my
final
answer
i
can
not
marry
would
he
call
it
coming
a
cropper
and
rend
her
with
reproaches
and
then
a
little
panic
seized
her
that
no
reason
she
could
urge
would
stand
the
tide
of
ted
s
remonstrances
she
did
not
acknowledge
it
to
herself
and
yet
a
vague
consciousness
underlay
her
musings
that
the
masterful
way
in
which
he
had
held
her
hands
and
looked
at
her
with
ardent
eyes
made
some
hitherto
unknown
chord
of
her
nature
vibrate
in
unison
with
his
will
perhaps
it
was
a
faint
reminiscence
in
her
blood
of
the
remote
ancestresses
of
who
were
knocked
on
the
head
if
they
did
not
fall
in
with
the
marital
arrangements
made
for
them
xxiv
stella
had
not
been
unfair
in
conjecturing
that
laurette
s
absence
from
the
after
her
brother
came
in
was
not
accidental
it
had
not
however
been
her
design
to
stay
away
so
long
a
circumstance
which
was
in
point
of
fact
due
to
her
having
a
bitter
fit
of
crying
this
was
with
her
an
extremely
unusual
circumstance
and
was
caused
by
no
sentimental
weakness
the
laconic
telegram
she
had
received
would
not
of
itself
have
thrown
much
light
on
her
emotion
it
was
dated
from
sydney
and
merely
contained
the
words
can
not
be
back
for
some
days
to
come
talbot
that
was
all
but
its
bitterness
like
that
of
many
other
events
lay
in
the
context
there
was
no
legitimate
excuse
for
his
sojourn
in
sydney
even
business
elastic
as
it
is
in
the
hands
of
a
wary
and
unfaithful
husband
could
not
in
any
possible
guise
be
held
accountable
for
this
move
in
order
to
go
to
sydney
from
banjoleena
tareling
must
have
passed
through
melbourne
laurette
had
no
need
to
waste
time
in
asking
herself
why
he
had
done
so
like
a
fugitive
it
was
owing
to
the
recent
departure
for
sydney
of
a
wretched
little
opera
singer
who
was
tareling
s
last
infatuation
laurette
reviewed
the
situation
in
the
light
of
past
events
cheered
by
his
success
in
celestial
hills
she
had
without
a
murmur
allowed
him
to
retain
possession
of
the
nine
hundred
pounds
that
had
been
netted
by
the
timely
sale
of
her
shares
in
that
mine
tareling
had
gone
to
banjoleena
with
this
money
to
his
credit
confident
of
doubling
or
trebling
the
amount
in
a
few
days
perhaps
he
had
but
she
knew
that
he
would
return
from
sydney
penniless
yet
imperturbably
unrepentant
it
was
one
of
tareling
s
aristocratic
characteristics
that
he
never
attempted
the
of
the
prodigal
son
he
was
obliged
to
come
home
when
the
fun
was
over
but
there
any
simulacrum
of
repentance
began
and
ended
so
it
had
been
before
so
it
would
be
no
doubt
to
the
end
but
just
now
owing
to
a
conjunction
of
untoward
events
this
spell
of
riotous
living
meant
for
she
could
by
some
means
or
other
raise
the
almost
immediate
giving
up
of
the
costly
furnished
house
at
toorak
and
retirement
to
the
intolerable
solitude
of
cannawijera
and
this
to
laurette
presented
all
the
concentrated
bitterness
of
a
hopeless
defeat
in
the
hour
of
greatest
triumph
she
had
married
talbot
tareling
not
for
love
for
even
if
she
had
been
capable
of
it
he
was
the
last
one
qualified
to
evoke
any
such
passion
when
the
two
met
not
for
his
good
looks
for
he
had
none
not
for
his
morals
for
if
he
ever
possessed
any
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
had
wholly
despoiled
him
long
before
he
left
his
native
shores
she
had
married
him
simply
because
he
was
the
younger
son
of
an
english
peer
relying
on
this
circumstance
and
her
own
tact
and
to
become
one
of
the
elect
of
melbourne
society
yet
with
all
these
advantages
the
struggle
had
been
very
uphill
her
income
when
the
marriage
took
place
was
over
three
thousand
a
year
the
hon
talbot
was
supposed
to
have
five
hundred
a
year
but
it
was
invariably
in
the
hands
of
disreputable
hebrews
twelve
months
in
advance
the
sinews
of
war
were
wholly
inadequate
to
the
sort
of
campaign
that
laurette
undertook
and
then
even
in
a
frankly
democratic
country
the
cadet
of
a
noble
house
bankrupt
in
money
and
reputation
does
not
meet
with
unqualified
social
success
but
laurette
was
indefatigable
and
year
by
year
she
made
a
little
headway
only
year
by
year
there
was
an
accumulation
of
debt
and
tradespeople
made
their
terms
harder
and
her
father
and
brother
were
more
reluctant
to
supplement
her
income
from
cannawijera
by
random
cheques
for
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
but
then
came
the
brilliant
windfall
of
the
new
governor
and
his
in
rank
and
nearly
connected
with
her
husband
s
family
this
gave
her
at
one
stroke
that
right
of
tambour
at
government
house
which
had
been
her
cherished
dream
from
early
girlhood
she
planted
her
feet
on
the
neck
of
recalcitrant
tradesmen
and
spiteful
foes
of
her
own
sex
in
the
inner
cliques
of
that
curiously
disintegrated
mass
which
calls
itself
good
society
in
the
capitals
of
australian
colonies
her
hour
of
victory
had
come
the
governor
s
wife
was
not
only
closely
related
to
tareling
s
family
but
an
intimate
friend
of
his
mother
s
before
leaving
london
she
had
pledged
herself
to
do
all
she
could
for
talbot
vaguely
imagining
that
in
a
wealthy
young
country
like
victoria
it
would
be
easy
to
smuggle
a
relative
into
some
cosy
sinecure
worth
well
say
seven
or
eight
hundred
a
year
but
a
very
brief
sojourn
in
australia
reveals
the
fact
that
to
appoint
a
man
to
a
post
worth
even
one
hundred
a
year
apart
from
fitness
for
the
work
or
claims
on
the
country
would
at
once
arouse
a
ferment
of
parliamentary
inquiry
now
the
hon
talbot
tareling
s
fitness
for
any
appointment
was
limited
to
a
and
hereditary
incapacity
for
any
form
of
steady
employment
his
claims
on
the
country
consisted
in
having
spent
all
his
own
and
a
great
deal
of
his
wife
s
money
in
very
equivocal
ways
the
profound
etiquette
and
the
glamour
of
monarchical
institutions
are
needed
to
elevate
such
traits
into
an
irresistible
claim
on
the
public
finances
but
at
least
it
was
in
lady
weavelow
s
power
to
shower
those
delicate
attentions
on
her
cousin
and
his
wife
which
from
a
viceregal
personage
are
objects
of
keener
ambition
in
melbourne
than
money
or
appointments
in
laurette
lady
weavelow
was
agreeably
surprised
to
find
a
lady
whose
demeanour
dress
and
general
would
bring
no
discredit
on
her
husband
even
among
the
order
to
which
he
belonged
stella
had
once
spoken
of
the
hard
crude
touch
of
the
social
amateur
in
laurette
but
like
all
who
do
not
possess
the
ultimate
distinction
of
manners
moulded
by
hereditary
culture
or
the
spontaneous
courtesy
of
an
essentially
kind
heart
laurette
s
behaviour
was
largely
dependent
on
circumstances
with
people
like
the
courtlands
whose
unostentatious
family
pride
made
them
indifferent
to
those
forms
of
social
distinctions
which
had
the
keenest
fascination
for
laurette
she
was
probably
at
her
worst
their
simple
mode
of
living
their
ardour
for
books
and
ideas
their
absence
of
chic
measured
by
local
standards
the
humble
nondescript
sort
of
people
marked
only
by
unselfish
aims
of
life
that
one
constantly
met
at
gave
her
a
certain
sense
of
superiority
to
them
and
yet
a
baffling
sense
that
they
would
regard
such
an
assumption
as
very
amusing
and
not
to
be
taken
seriously
she
was
at
her
best
with
those
whose
rank
and
position
towered
above
her
own
she
was
then
on
her
guard
against
the
robust
vulgarity
that
formed
the
real
substratum
of
her
nature
she
was
quick
and
clever
in
her
own
way
and
prided
herself
on
knowledge
of
the
world
in
her
case
as
in
that
of
all
intrinsically
shallow
natures
such
knowledge
is
largely
though
unconsciously
founded
on
the
dictum
of
the
scotchman
there
is
no
an
honest
man
in
the
world
i
ken
it
by
mysel
but
probably
the
very
narrowness
of
laurette
s
aims
made
her
feel
all
the
more
acutely
the
prospect
of
speedy
social
extinction
after
she
reached
her
own
room
she
reread
the
telegram
with
a
sickening
heart
she
recalled
her
father
s
obstinate
refusal
at
to
advance
a
few
hundred
pounds
till
after
of
course
he
knew
that
to
advance
was
merely
a
euphemism
for
giving
he
told
her
that
till
the
rabbits
were
exterminated
on
his
runs
he
would
neither
give
nor
advance
a
single
copper
and
advised
herself
and
her
husband
to
live
quietly
on
their
cannawijera
property
instead
of
running
head
over
ears
into
debt
in
melbourne
to
go
to
these
desolate
wilds
from
the
very
apex
of
her
the
haunts
and
assemblies
whose
had
cost
her
so
many
toilsome
years
of
guerilla
warfare
with
millionaire
women
whose
dull
resentment
she
had
aroused
with
the
unguarded
malice
of
a
sharp
and
vindictive
tongue
in
a
week
after
her
departure
her
place
in
society
would
know
her
no
more
the
world
abounds
with
those
who
are
terrified
at
nothing
so
much
as
being
forgotten
if
people
are
buried
in
the
mallee
scrub
society
has
no
alternative
but
to
forget
them
the
thought
suffocated
laurette
in
advance
and
then
would
not
stay
at
cannawijera
more
than
a
week
at
the
outside
to
make
life
endurable
to
him
in
such
a
it
would
be
necessary
to
erase
twelve
hours
out
of
the
even
in
melbourne
he
was
often
dull
against
dulness
he
had
not
one
honest
resource
still
less
would
this
be
the
case
when
his
wife
was
permanently
at
cannawijera
and
he
was
permanently
a
man
about
town
he
had
an
incredible
knack
of
obtaining
credit
it
must
have
been
inherited
with
his
blue
blood
a
man
habituated
to
the
brutal
habit
of
paying
for
what
he
got
could
never
attain
such
perfect
mastery
of
the
art
he
was
skilful
too
or
lucky
rather
at
games
of
chance
yes
he
would
keep
afloat
for
a
few
months
but
after
that
he
would
join
some
theatrical
company
and
leave
the
colonies
laurette
was
sure
of
it
he
was
a
good
amateur
actor
he
had
been
trained
by
experts
there
were
in
many
popular
plays
in
which
he
could
give
actors
points
and
yet
come
off
winner
from
the
fact
that
in
such
he
had
only
to
present
his
own
character
in
the
less
habitual
parts
that
were
fitted
for
stage
of
a
cool
unscrupulous
man
of
the
world
it
was
his
one
chance
of
getting
a
livelihood
he
had
more
than
once
spoken
of
taking
it
up
when
the
dark
desolation
of
cannawijera
loomed
in
the
foreground
as
the
only
refuge
open
to
him
apart
from
gaining
an
independent
livelihood
he
will
attach
himself
to
mademoiselle
de
melier
s
company
and
go
to
san
francisco
thought
laurette
and
she
turned
cold
and
faint
with
the
conviction
the
thought
that
she
had
lived
for
seemed
to
be
crumbling
around
her
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
felt
better
after
she
was
able
to
cry
she
heard
stella
leave
the
and
she
debated
with
herself
whether
she
would
go
to
her
brother
and
throw
herself
at
his
feet
and
implore
him
to
save
her
from
the
ignominious
series
of
defeats
of
social
annihilation
which
she
saw
in
store
for
her
but
the
next
moment
she
rejected
the
thought
if
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
would
do
her
any
good
ted
would
give
a
cheque
at
once
but
he
was
far
more
obdurate
about
larger
sums
than
ever
her
father
had
been
he
knew
too
well
what
tareling
s
mode
of
life
was
he
himself
had
worked
hard
from
the
age
of
sixteen
till
his
uncle
s
death
left
him
sole
master
of
strathhaye
and
he
had
an
invincible
objection
to
placing
an
unlimited
supply
of
cash
at
the
disposal
of
an
image
of
a
man
who
never
did
a
stroke
of
work
in
his
life
for
himself
or
anyone
laurette
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
one
design
after
another
flashed
hastily
across
her
mind
to
write
and
tell
her
father
that
some
dire
catastrophe
impended
unless
he
could
send
her
say
a
thousand
pounds
no
she
had
done
that
more
than
once
before
it
was
the
story
of
the
and
the
wolf
over
again
then
slowly
something
like
a
feasible
plan
suggested
itself
but
she
determined
to
ponder
over
it
for
a
day
or
two
at
the
end
of
that
time
however
events
ranged
themselves
precisely
in
the
direction
she
wished
stella
announced
to
her
that
louise
was
not
well
and
asked
her
to
hasten
her
visit
as
much
as
possible
if
you
will
let
me
leave
by
the
early
train
laurette
i
shall
write
and
let
coram
and
the
others
whose
invitations
i
accepted
know
that
i
have
been
called
away
and
then
i
can
see
you
again
on
my
way
home
if
you
stella
spoke
in
an
apologetic
tone
feeling
half
guilty
for
beating
so
hasty
a
retreat
but
the
enforced
companionship
with
laurette
began
to
be
intolerable
her
sustained
enthusiasm
about
trifles
the
glow
of
inextinguishable
interest
with
which
she
retailed
lady
weavelow
s
opinions
and
sayings
and
doings
the
solemn
reverence
with
which
she
went
over
the
connections
of
lord
harry
the
and
entered
into
endless
details
regarding
those
she
held
to
be
the
great
people
of
melbourne
bored
stella
to
the
last
point
of
ennui
it
was
like
being
in
the
society
of
servants
but
without
the
interest
of
the
servants
point
of
view
at
first
hand
then
the
whole
atmosphere
of
monico
lodge
oppressed
her
so
that
she
could
not
even
read
any
book
she
cared
for
the
very
walls
and
chairs
seemed
to
whisper
endless
anecdotes
full
of
foolish
and
count
over
the
provincial
notabilities
who
paid
them
visits
we
never
know
says
goethe
somewhere
how
anthropomorphic
we
probably
those
who
do
have
a
glimmering
of
it
conceal
the
fact
because
the
habit
of
endowing
lifeless
objects
with
a
personality
of
their
own
has
in
the
eyes
of
most
practical
people
something
in
it
dangerously
silly
well
said
laurette
a
sudden
light
coming
into
her
face
i
will
let
you
off
on
condition
you
promise
to
stay
two
weeks
with
me
when
you
return
there
is
an
english
to
be
here
early
in
september
and
a
french
royalty
incog
so
we
shall
have
the
place
but
as
laurette
spoke
her
heart
sank
as
she
thought
i
may
then
perhaps
be
entombed
in
the
mallee
stella
had
spent
the
previous
day
with
her
brother
by
the
seaside
had
she
made
any
irrevocable
decision
perhaps
she
meant
to
write
to
ted
laurette
had
noticed
the
pearl
horseshoe
wrapped
up
on
stella
s
in
an
isolated
fashion
as
if
she
did
not
mean
to
include
it
in
her
belongings
ted
had
gone
to
kilda
and
would
not
be
back
till
the
next
afternoon
stella
s
departure
in
his
absence
was
so
far
no
communication
passed
between
them
laurette
was
just
then
in
a
curiously
strained
and
watchful
mood
she
was
all
eyes
and
ears
she
determined
on
a
little
conversation
that
might
help
to
fetter
stella
s
action
till
they
met
conversation
that
might
also
aid
in
the
development
of
her
little
coup
it
was
not
that
facts
were
at
all
necessary
to
her
when
she
found
a
little
impromptu
history
helpful
but
facts
even
when
twisted
entirely
from
their
true
drift
and
context
are
valuable
as
imparting
a
certain
to
supposed
events
there
are
people
who
will
report
an
entirely
imaginary
conversation
and
find
a
kind
of
moral
support
in
adding
yes
he
sat
in
an
armchair
all
the
time
with
his
slippered
feet
on
the
the
he
in
question
may
not
have
uttered
a
word
of
the
many
ascribed
to
then
he
did
sit
in
an
armchair
and
his
feet
were
really
on
the
fender
after
all
human
veracity
has
severe
limitations
we
can
not
have
everything
limning
the
severe
countenance
of
truth
let
us
remember
this
when
in
contemporary
history
we
have
the
conversation
all
askew
but
the
armchair
the
slippered
feet
and
the
fender
true
to
the
life
stella
may
i
speak
to
you
a
little
about
ted
said
laurette
with
an
engaging
air
of
timidity
she
was
really
very
quick
at
times
in
diagnosing
the
frame
of
mind
in
which
people
happened
to
be
and
she
had
a
prevision
that
her
subject
just
then
must
be
cautiously
broached
stella
had
not
gone
out
riding
with
ted
since
the
evening
he
had
offended
her
and
he
had
admitted
to
laurette
before
he
went
to
flemington
that
he
had
been
a
deuced
jackass
but
when
she
questioned
him
he
had
relapsed
into
dogged
silence
why
laurette
you
speak
as
though
ted
were
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
what
do
you
wish
to
say
well
no
doubt
i
am
rather
foolish
to
be
so
much
concerned
you
see
stella
you
have
so
many
brothers
you
do
not
know
how
a
woman
feels
when
she
has
only
one
poor
dear
ted
is
so
unhappy
just
now
he
offended
you
well
i
undertook
to
make
his
peace
with
you
he
did
not
go
into
particulars
perhaps
he
begged
for
one
of
the
many
kisses
you
owe
him
dear
me
what
a
freezing
air
i
wonder
how
many
kisses
your
brother
tom
snatched
from
me
and
yet
he
never
proposed
to
me
even
once
certainly
i
never
set
up
for
a
monument
of
icy
hauteur
still
i
never
forgot
that
i
was
sir
edward
ritchie
s
daughter
any
more
than
i
am
likely
to
forget
that
i
am
the
wife
of
the
hon
talbot
laurette
drew
herself
up
to
her
full
height
and
stella
was
too
much
amused
to
retain
an
air
of
offended
majesty
at
the
same
time
said
laurette
astutely
taking
advantage
of
this
to
show
a
sudden
change
of
front
i
don
t
think
you
need
be
afraid
of
ted
pestering
you
again
now
my
dear
let
us
have
a
proper
talk
over
this
sit
down
here
we
may
as
well
be
comfortable
and
not
stand
staring
at
each
other
like
two
strange
cats
on
the
roof
i
believe
there
were
tears
in
ted
s
eyes
when
he
took
me
into
his
confidence
what
do
you
think
i
d
better
do
larry
said
he
do
said
i
why
nothing
but
i
am
afraid
she
s
very
angry
said
he
she
hasn
t
even
ridden
out
with
me
since
and
now
she
s
away
for
the
whole
day
it
feels
as
long
as
a
month
of
sundays
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
she
sent
me
back
that
dashed
horseshoe
i
am
afraid
he
used
a
stronger
word
poor
old
ted
you
know
he
is
a
little
rough
sometimes
but
how
good
and
generous
he
is
i
sometimes
call
him
stingy
in
fun
there
he
was
yesterday
trying
to
make
me
take
a
cheque
for
i
don
t
know
how
much
but
of
course
when
a
woman
is
married
there
is
a
limit
to
what
she
can
accept
even
from
a
brother
besides
i
had
a
sort
of
feeling
that
it
was
more
for
your
sake
than
my
sort
of
testimonial
because
i
am
nice
enough
for
you
to
visit
laurette
when
it
suited
her
purpose
was
a
finished
mistress
of
that
adroit
flattery
which
seema
inseparable
from
radical
insincerity
of
nature
i
must
say
that
was
very
humble
of
you
said
stella
laughing
outright
it
is
foolish
to
flatter
people
with
a
strong
sense
of
humour
even
if
they
like
it
they
must
see
through
it
well
but
to
return
to
this
storm
in
a
teacup
i
couldn
t
help
laughing
about
the
horseshoe
and
i
said
if
stella
wants
to
get
rid
of
that
in
a
huff
why
i
ll
take
charge
of
it
i
wish
you
would
laurette
i
ll
leave
it
in
your
hands
said
stella
oh
certainly
returned
laurette
with
an
indulgent
smile
and
she
mentally
ticked
this
off
as
one
point
gained
but
she
had
not
finished
yet
then
ted
said
to
me
now
larry
tell
you
think
i
m
any
nearer
the
end
of
this
long
courtship
one
way
or
the
other
is
it
more
likely
or
unlikely
that
stella
will
have
me
ted
said
i
don
t
ask
me
what
stella
will
do
or
will
not
do
i
ve
long
ago
felt
about
this
affair
as
if
i
were
looking
at
a
of
the
sort
that
nearly
makes
you
fall
in
pieces
with
yawning
don
t
you
know
it
s
so
long
and
people
come
on
and
off
and
you
sit
through
one
act
after
another
thinking
that
surely
something
will
happen
soon
but
it
doesn
t
and
there
you
gape
till
the
curtain
is
rung
down
and
you
feel
like
a
perfect
fool
at
that
ted
got
rather
angry
as
if
i
were
prophesying
evil
of
course
i
didn
t
mean
to
do
that
so
i
simply
said
when
a
girl
lets
a
man
dangle
after
her
for
you
had
no
right
to
said
stella
colouring
hotly
well
please
remember
this
was
a
confidential
chat
with
my
only
brother
when
a
girl
lets
a
man
dangle
after
her
for
years
and
prevents
him
from
thinking
of
anyone
else
and
in
the
end
doesn
t
know
whether
she
ll
have
him
or
leave
then
i
think
it
is
time
for
him
to
take
his
fortune
into
his
own
hands
well
that
at
least
was
good
advice
said
stella
and
i
hope
ted
will
act
on
will
you
believe
it
said
laurette
he
has
solemnly
made
up
his
mind
that
unless
you
write
to
him
about
something
or
give
him
some
direct
encouragement
he
will
from
this
time
forth
try
to
think
of
you
only
as
a
friend
i
believe
that
is
partly
why
he
has
gone
to
i
am
glad
that
he
is
reasonable
at
fast
answered
stella
but
notwithstanding
the
words
laurette
felt
sure
there
was
some
pique
in
the
flush
that
settled
in
the
girl
s
cheeks
xxv
when
ritchie
returned
and
found
that
during
his
absence
stella
had
taken
her
departure
for
lullaboolagana
his
chagrin
was
extreme
she
asked
me
to
say
to
you
for
herself
and
dustiefoot
and
gave
her
kind
regards
to
shah
said
laurette
as
she
sat
skimming
a
budget
of
letters
and
notes
that
had
just
been
delivered
ted
felt
like
one
who
has
suddenly
been
dragged
out
of
the
sunlight
and
has
had
the
key
turned
on
him
in
a
cheerless
dungeon
she
is
to
finish
her
visit
in
september
said
laurette
when
she
found
that
ted
made
no
response
he
stared
at
the
for
some
time
in
gloomy
silence
glancing
from
one
column
to
another
as
if
he
were
reading
but
not
seeing
a
line
well
i
don
t
suppose
it
s
to
make
much
difference
to
me
whether
she
comes
here
or
anywhere
else
he
answered
laurette
made
no
reply
was
that
all
stella
said
asked
ritchie
after
a
pause
just
to
say
was
she
at
all
put
out
that
louise
wanted
her
at
once
or
was
the
thing
a
plant
do
you
an
excuse
to
be
off
ted
don
t
ask
so
many
questions
or
i
shall
betray
confidence
said
laurette
betray
confidence
bosh
retorted
ritchie
in
a
disdainful
tone
you
can
t
run
with
the
hare
and
hunt
with
the
hounds
at
you
thought
you
were
going
to
do
great
shakes
by
getting
stella
here
and
showing
her
what
a
dash
you
cut
and
now
she
s
gone
off
in
less
than
two
weeks
without
even
saying
to
me
and
then
there
s
something
that
you
know
in
confidence
i
should
think
i
am
the
proper
person
to
be
taken
into
confidence
if
there
s
anything
to
you
asked
if
stella
only
said
said
laurette
in
an
impressive
tone
well
we
had
a
long
private
ted
leant
forward
no
longer
pretending
to
read
the
newspaper
yes
and
what
was
the
talk
about
before
telling
you
that
i
must
get
your
promise
that
you
will
not
let
stella
know
i
told
i
m
not
such
a
confounded
blab
as
to
carry
yarns
between
then
tell
me
has
stella
since
she
came
here
said
anything
that
led
you
to
think
she
had
been
debating
in
her
own
mind
whether
or
not
she
would
accept
you
yes
she
told
me
that
since
i
last
saw
her
she
had
sometimes
thought
she
would
come
to
the
ah
well
after
all
you
understood
her
better
than
i
do
they
say
that
women
have
so
much
penetration
but
i
think
some
men
have
you
asked
me
one
day
if
i
thought
stella
had
heard
well
she
ah
i
suppose
cuth
the
parson
has
fossicked
i
don
t
think
so
i
believe
it
is
a
slight
rumour
but
enough
to
disquiet
make
her
i
shall
write
and
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
tell
her
not
for
your
life
at
least
not
if
you
don
t
mean
to
lose
lose
her
i
haven
t
got
her
and
not
likely
to
now
ah
there
you
are
mistaken
stella
loves
you
ted
and
laurette
without
a
quiver
of
her
eyelid
gazed
into
the
young
man
s
face
he
flushed
deeply
and
walked
about
the
room
with
signs
of
evident
emotion
if
i
could
believe
he
said
and
stopped
you
may
believe
it
she
said
in
a
tone
of
quiet
confidence
which
thrilled
him
with
joy
and
in
spite
she
has
heard
yes
and
when
she
returns
here
in
i
can
only
judge
by
what
she
said
and
by
what
she
did
not
say
which
is
often
quite
as
important
and
by
what
i
believe
you
will
get
a
speedy
answer
but
whatever
you
do
don
t
write
to
her
till
you
do
see
her
for
she
would
instantly
think
i
told
you
all
that
passed
between
us
and
i
have
not
done
that
and
don
t
mean
well
larry
this
is
very
good
news
you
have
given
me
said
ted
and
he
was
so
much
moved
that
his
voice
trembled
some
visitors
were
announced
and
ted
took
himself
off
and
went
for
a
long
spin
on
shah
trying
to
realize
that
his
tedious
years
of
waiting
were
after
all
to
be
crowned
with
the
one
great
joy
that
had
so
long
seemed
a
vision
beyond
his
reach
the
next
little
scene
in
laurette
s
coup
took
place
three
days
later
in
the
evening
ted
was
to
return
to
strathhaye
on
the
following
day
a
servant
brought
in
some
letters
on
a
salver
among
them
was
one
which
laurette
had
posted
to
herself
containing
a
long
letter
that
tareling
had
written
to
her
a
year
or
two
previously
latterly
he
never
wrote
long
letters
even
on
business
laurette
crushed
the
envelope
into
her
pocket
and
began
to
read
this
letter
with
an
air
of
absorbed
attention
presently
she
gave
a
little
sharp
cry
what
s
the
row
said
ted
looking
up
a
letter
from
tareling
he
said
glancing
at
the
sheet
which
laurette
with
a
most
dejected
countenance
but
she
said
nothing
she
read
one
or
two
more
notes
one
of
them
a
delightfully
intimate
one
from
the
hon
miss
brendover
lady
weavelow
s
sister
asking
laurette
and
miss
courtland
to
spend
an
afternoon
at
government
house
in
an
informal
way
two
days
hence
tell
me
ted
said
laurette
suddenly
how
much
is
father
really
affected
by
the
rabbits
how
much
well
there
you
ask
a
question
that
neither
he
nor
i
can
answer
at
present
within
the
last
twelve
months
he
has
spent
on
sending
the
bunnies
to
and
how
much
he
ll
spend
during
the
current
twelve
months
the
lord
only
knows
but
i
thought
this
rabbit
extermination
was
partly
at
the
expense
of
government
exactly
and
that
s
why
the
vermin
have
been
increasing
head
over
heels
why
the
governor
himself
has
had
rabbits
trapped
with
the
scalp
taken
off
and
let
run
again
that
they
may
go
on
breeding
you
see
these
scoundrels
in
government
pay
mean
to
make
a
permanent
job
of
it
they
get
so
much
for
every
scalp
so
instead
of
killing
the
little
brutes
they
sometimes
carefully
take
the
skin
off
the
top
of
the
head
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
there
are
thousands
more
bred
by
the
animals
they
have
been
paid
for
killing
when
the
governor
saw
what
was
going
on
he
jacked
up
at
the
government
notice
he
would
see
to
doing
away
with
the
rabbits
on
his
own
account
so
there
he
is
paying
at
the
rate
of
a
day
and
putting
up
a
fence
between
his
land
and
the
land
in
government
but
then
of
course
father
has
been
saving
a
lot
of
money
all
these
years
it
doesn
t
take
more
than
eight
or
nine
thousand
a
year
to
keep
godolphin
house
yes
he
has
unfortunately
put
four
or
five
hundred
thousand
pounds
into
good
investments
in
south
australia
said
ted
grimly
he
had
in
commercial
bank
shares
which
at
the
present
moment
may
be
had
for
an
old
song
he
has
in
the
town
and
country
bank
which
is
more
shaky
than
a
poplar
leaf
he
has
a
pot
of
money
in
tram
lines
that
will
yet
be
sold
for
old
iron
and
he
has
heaps
of
tin
in
houses
that
cost
him
a
handsome
sum
every
quarter
for
broken
windows
and
advertisements
for
tenants
that
don
t
turn
up
perhaps
you
thought
the
governor
cut
up
rather
rough
when
he
had
to
a
thousand
pounds
over
that
shady
concern
of
tareling
s
six
months
ago
but
by
jove
if
you
knew
how
much
money
the
old
man
has
dropped
lately
in
one
way
or
well
i
suppose
we
ll
have
to
take
up
our
abode
permanently
at
cannawijera
said
laurette
in
a
resigned
tone
yes
it
licks
me
why
you
don
t
make
more
of
a
home
of
that
place
said
the
unsuspecting
make
a
ve
only
got
to
irrigate
you
know
it
s
ridiculous
to
pay
a
manager
on
a
little
station
like
make
the
place
trim
and
comfortable
in
fact
stella
told
me
she
liked
coonjooree
so
much
the
last
time
she
was
there
she
means
to
go
again
before
long
jove
i
hope
i
may
be
there
if
she
does
well
you
see
i
am
not
one
of
the
gifted
souls
that
love
a
old
poet
so
much
better
than
my
said
laurette
a
little
viciously
and
the
next
moment
regretted
giving
any
indication
of
the
loathing
that
the
place
excited
in
her
mind
but
she
had
the
faculty
of
saying
sharp
things
and
found
it
hard
to
resist
the
temptation
but
now
that
nothing
else
is
left
to
us
she
said
with
a
pensive
well
i
dare
say
we
shall
make
the
best
of
it
perhaps
if
you
come
to
see
us
next
month
ted
you
will
find
talbot
planting
a
against
the
you
must
bet
him
it
won
t
grow
larry
or
he
ll
never
finish
the
job
said
ted
laughing
you
mean
next
year
though
not
next
month
by
way
of
answer
laurette
unfolded
her
husband
s
letter
and
read
aloud
it
is
only
fair
to
let
you
know
at
as
early
a
date
as
possible
that
i
have
lost
every
stiver
of
the
money
i
brought
with
me
and
am
probably
liable
for
as
much
more
this
comes
of
trying
to
earn
money
by
downright
honest
baccarat
interjected
ted
but
laurette
did
not
heed
this
if
i
had
been
content
as
so
many
are
to
take
the
words
of
thieving
brokers
instead
of
coming
here
to
see
for
myself
we
would
probably
have
trebled
our
little
haul
from
the
celestial
hills
but
it
s
no
use
crying
over
spilt
milk
and
i
am
determined
that
neither
you
nor
i
will
ask
a
loan
or
an
advance
from
your
father
laurette
stopped
short
that
hunks
of
a
brother
of
yours
that
s
about
it
isn
t
it
said
ted
without
a
of
malice
don
t
mind
me
larry
tareling
and
i
understand
each
other
well
what
then
but
we
must
at
once
leave
melbourne
so
please
put
the
house
immediately
in
sibworth
s
hands
and
make
all
your
preparations
for
leaving
on
or
before
the
of
this
month
ted
gave
a
low
whistle
and
laurette
folded
up
the
letter
with
an
inimitable
air
of
resignation
but
if
you
go
then
what
of
stella
s
visit
said
ted
with
folds
in
his
brow
stella
s
visit
repeated
laurette
absently
oh
to
be
sure
to
tell
you
the
truth
my
dear
ted
i
am
too
much
taken
aback
by
the
position
to
think
much
of
anything
beyond
the
domestic
horizon
it
is
so
and
if
talbot
had
had
a
little
luck
we
should
have
paid
off
nearly
all
our
little
arrears
and
then
of
course
there
would
be
the
shearing
in
laurette
avoided
allusion
to
the
fact
that
this
had
been
long
ago
discounted
and
the
advance
used
up
and
creditors
appeased
only
with
fictitious
promises
of
payment
after
the
shearing
already
disposed
of
of
course
you
will
see
stella
at
her
own
home
though
i
think
there
is
something
in
the
wind
about
her
going
abroad
with
raymond
it
is
to
her
i
trace
the
rumour
that
has
set
but
there
i
must
not
mix
up
things
and
other
people
s
secrets
larry
you
mustn
t
mustn
t
give
up
monico
lodge
till
after
ah
my
dear
boy
i
would
be
only
too
happy
but
it
s
beyond
my
power
it
did
flash
across
my
mind
that
i
would
write
and
ask
father
but
now
that
you
ve
explained
about
the
rabbits
and
but
there
are
no
rabbits
at
strathhaye
laurette
looked
wonderingly
at
her
brother
and
then
a
sudden
light
seemed
to
dawn
on
her
oh
ted
don
t
tempt
me
i
ll
be
honest
it
isn
t
what
would
keep
monico
lodge
going
but
being
so
nearly
connected
with
the
weavelows
we
are
in
the
swim
of
everything
i
wouldn
t
undertake
to
stay
for
the
rest
of
the
unless
talbot
s
aunt
was
kind
enough
to
die
and
he
got
the
few
thousand
pounds
for
which
he
is
down
in
her
will
but
she
was
always
a
cantankerous
old
cat
i
dare
say
she
ll
live
for
fifteen
years
to
come
and
lately
she
has
taken
quite
a
passion
for
the
burmese
she
helped
to
scud
two
missionaries
among
the
chins
there
but
they
were
eaten
or
something
i
don
t
know
whether
they
do
eat
them
in
burmah
but
at
any
rate
she
s
going
to
send
more
how
old
ladies
of
the
aristocracy
of
england
should
send
missionaries
anywhere
while
the
young
men
of
their
own
class
are
what
they
the
old
ones
too
for
the
matter
of
that
i
dare
say
they
know
how
hopeless
it
would
be
whereas
people
that
you
never
see
you
can
believe
all
sorts
of
romantic
things
about
them
their
conversions
and
things
and
then
i
suppose
wild
creatures
who
haven
t
got
a
stick
of
furniture
or
a
shirt
to
their
backs
can
afford
to
be
really
laurette
had
taken
up
a
seam
from
a
near
and
was
sewing
away
most
industriously
while
she
rambled
on
in
this
artless
fashion
ted
rose
abruptly
and
without
saying
a
word
went
to
his
own
room
he
returned
presently
and
laurette
noticed
with
a
beating
heart
that
he
had
a
in
his
hand
he
sat
down
at
a
davenport
in
the
corner
of
the
room
and
wrote
for
a
few
minutes
rapidly
blotted
the
cheque
and
stood
near
his
sister
don
t
talk
in
that
way
about
the
old
woman
larry
i
think
you
may
always
reckon
that
the
australian
side
of
your
clan
will
do
more
for
you
than
the
side
keep
this
as
much
as
you
can
in
your
own
hands
and
if
you
want
it
you
can
have
as
much
again
at
the
end
of
with
that
ted
put
down
the
cheque
before
laurette
and
hastened
to
leave
the
room
it
was
for
fifteen
hundred
pounds
it
seemed
to
ted
that
larry
didn
t
look
at
the
amount
at
all
when
she
rose
with
a
little
exclamation
of
joy
intercepted
him
and
threw
her
arms
round
him
there
larry
don
t
slobber
i
think
you
ought
to
say
your
prayers
for
that
old
woman
it
sticks
in
my
gizzard
entirely
to
hear
people
talk
in
that
way
of
old
them
their
bit
of
tucker
and
their
own
fireside
why
even
the
niggers
never
knocked
the
old
ones
on
the
head
unless
there
was
a
big
with
this
little
homily
ted
went
out
and
laurette
hardly
able
to
believe
her
senses
stared
at
the
cheque
with
beaming
eyes
she
had
hardly
dared
to
hope
for
such
complete
success
as
much
again
at
the
end
of
september
but
of
course
that
was
spoken
in
the
elation
of
believing
his
suit
was
to
prosper
like
a
wary
general
laurette
began
to
sum
up
the
situation
she
was
secure
against
detection
as
to
those
excursions
of
the
imagination
she
had
dealt
in
till
her
brother
and
stella
met
and
as
far
as
ted
was
concerned
probably
altogether
secure
for
if
that
idiotic
girl
finally
rejected
him
that
was
the
ultimate
misfortune
to
him
and
everything
else
would
sink
into
insignificance
stella
would
be
the
first
to
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
for
if
she
were
still
obdurate
the
first
thing
she
would
say
no
doubt
would
be
now
ted
i
thought
you
had
made
up
your
mind
that
we
were
just
to
be
friends
that
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
friends
she
mimicked
her
half
aloud
and
for
the
first
time
felt
her
smouldering
dislike
to
the
girl
warm
up
to
something
like
hatred
she
was
almost
sure
stella
would
cheat
her
out
of
the
other
fifteen
hundred
pounds
well
but
it
was
good
of
least
good
considering
he
had
never
given
her
more
than
three
or
four
hundred
pounds
at
a
time
before
but
after
all
a
young
man
with
about
fifteen
thousand
a
year
if
we
only
had
a
run
like
strathhaye
instead
of
that
desolate
hole
oh
thank
god
we
can
stay
in
melbourne
after
all
it
may
seem
curious
that
one
should
thank
god
for
the
result
of
so
much
devious
and
deception
but
when
we
consider
how
a
strong
nation
will
attack
a
weaker
one
for
no
better
motive
than
greed
or
ambition
or
the
lust
of
tyranny
and
then
go
to
church
to
chant
the
praises
of
the
almighty
because
tens
of
thousands
of
human
beings
have
been
slaughtered
and
tens
of
thousands
of
homes
have
been
desolated
and
impoverished
the
wonder
of
the
solitary
case
diminishes
it
is
not
safe
to
assume
that
the
individual
conscience
is
invariably
less
frayed
than
that
of
the
collective
nation
xxvi
the
of
lullaboolagana
was
one
of
those
delightful
places
which
at
once
convey
an
assurance
of
welcome
comfort
and
repose
it
was
partly
of
wood
partly
stone
with
additions
that
formed
an
irregular
chronology
of
the
past
the
detached
cottage
with
a
and
two
or
three
bedrooms
marked
the
season
in
which
the
number
of
sheep
shorn
touched
fifty
thousand
the
addition
with
the
gable
end
dated
the
year
in
which
the
little
courtlands
first
had
a
governess
etc
the
house
had
deep
verandas
round
three
sides
the
roof
washed
so
as
to
lessen
the
force
of
the
summer
sun
gleamed
with
a
seductive
cheerfulness
and
air
of
salutation
among
the
encircling
foliage
several
outbuildings
at
varying
distances
made
the
look
at
a
little
distance
like
a
miniature
village
the
and
shearers
house
with
two
or
three
huts
formed
a
second
group
of
houses
westward
beyond
the
confines
of
what
was
known
as
the
home
field
this
consisted
of
over
forty
acres
of
land
which
had
been
subjected
to
an
artless
form
of
landscape
gardening
by
a
relative
of
the
courtlands
who
had
left
england
under
sentence
of
death
from
consumption
and
had
lived
at
lullaboolagana
for
eighteen
years
though
it
had
been
authoritatively
predicted
he
could
not
survive
the
long
here
then
he
had
employed
his
lease
of
life
in
testing
the
capabilities
of
australian
soil
in
growing
trees
and
plants
from
countries
here
like
shenstone
though
on
a
smaller
scale
he
planted
groves
and
avenues
and
alleys
diversified
his
woods
pointed
his
walks
and
entangled
his
shrubberies
the
result
was
a
charming
of
the
kind
that
the
british
race
are
so
skilful
in
creating
in
the
far
regions
of
the
earth
giving
their
under
alien
skies
a
touching
resemblance
to
the
old
quiet
homes
in
which
their
forefathers
may
have
lived
for
many
generations
there
were
avenues
on
every
side
of
the
home
field
composed
chiefly
of
italian
pines
which
in
twenty
years
had
attained
a
size
almost
incredible
for
that
period
the
home
field
was
not
closely
planted
all
over
it
there
were
wide
open
spaces
between
the
groves
and
woodlets
and
groups
of
trees
that
embraced
endless
species
from
the
firs
and
pines
of
the
north
to
the
palms
of
the
torrid
zone
with
a
liberal
proportion
of
australian
trees
simplicity
was
certainly
the
governing
taste
but
combined
with
a
blending
of
effects
which
when
perceived
added
a
new
attraction
all
round
the
house
there
were
blossoming
shrubs
and
a
great
variety
of
flowers
that
kept
up
a
procession
of
blooms
year
in
year
out
the
secret
of
perpetual
spring
in
flowers
is
solved
by
gardeners
in
the
more
favoured
portions
of
australia
there
were
several
gentle
hillocks
in
the
home
field
which
lent
themselves
to
landscape
effects
in
a
very
agreeable
manner
but
the
most
charming
natural
feature
of
all
was
the
creek
known
by
its
native
name
the
oolloolloo
it
meandered
through
the
whole
length
of
the
home
field
the
orchard
which
was
half
hidden
in
a
deep
little
valley
lay
in
two
unequal
portions
one
on
each
side
of
the
creek
its
course
was
still
marked
by
the
tall
seldom
absent
from
the
banks
of
creeks
indeed
these
trees
never
attain
their
finest
development
except
by
running
water
and
yet
they
have
to
live
through
centuries
in
waterless
wastes
is
there
not
here
something
of
the
same
curious
contradiction
that
we
find
between
the
complex
social
etiquette
of
the
aborigines
and
their
very
primitive
stage
of
savagedom
it
is
often
forced
upon
the
observer
of
nature
in
australia
that
in
the
past
she
has
been
playing
strange
pranks
among
other
trifles
brewing
pepper
for
her
children
instead
of
nourishing
them
with
milk
but
the
eucalypti
were
far
from
being
the
only
trees
that
grew
by
the
oolloolloo
side
by
side
with
these
natives
of
the
primeval
woods
were
copses
of
alders
overgrown
bushes
of
sweetbriar
bamboos
springing
up
tall
and
slender
and
falling
wide
apart
making
pictures
against
denser
foliage
like
japanese
screens
here
and
there
a
hazel
with
its
artless
bower
wide
clumps
of
pampas
grass
with
their
silky
blooms
softly
stirred
by
every
breath
of
wind
then
one
would
come
on
a
dense
little
grove
of
elms
and
native
mingled
with
scrub
combination
which
of
all
others
makes
the
most
alluring
secular
cloisters
a
place
in
which
to
dream
with
open
eyes
to
catch
phantasies
by
the
wing
to
read
shakespeare
to
one
s
self
aloud
to
muse
to
brood
to
meditate
over
all
there
was
an
enchanting
air
of
leisure
of
tranquil
repose
which
was
heightened
by
the
woods
that
lay
on
every
side
except
to
the
south
where
a
township
of
seven
or
eight
hundred
inhabitants
extended
in
an
irregular
fashion
within
two
miles
of
the
lullaboolagana
this
was
the
direction
the
house
fronted
and
opposite
to
it
there
was
a
bridge
across
the
oolloolloo
of
solid
masonry
it
was
the
third
that
spanned
the
creek
in
the
home
field
but
the
only
one
that
could
be
depended
on
when
the
winter
rains
were
heavy
and
the
sluggish
little
creek
with
its
silent
pools
connected
by
a
slender
trickling
thread
of
running
water
was
transformed
into
a
rushing
turbid
fury
of
a
rivulet
that
filled
the
adjacent
groves
with
its
enchanting
sound
the
second
bridge
was
an
enormous
which
from
time
immemorial
had
lain
across
the
creek
as
it
fell
its
great
old
withered
branches
extending
over
a
hundred
feet
beyond
the
creek
on
the
home
field
side
of
it
there
were
marks
all
along
the
upper
side
of
this
tree
made
by
the
stone
axe
of
the
aborigine
who
had
climbed
it
in
quest
of
opossums
or
to
place
his
dead
among
the
boughs
or
perhaps
to
scan
the
surrounding
country
for
the
little
column
of
pale
blue
smoke
that
might
proclaim
the
presence
of
a
tribal
foe
not
far
off
the
third
bridge
so
called
was
beneath
a
tall
slim
white
close
to
the
orchard
and
was
a
little
rustic
erection
perched
high
up
completely
covered
on
both
sides
with
trailing
creepers
conspicuous
among
them
the
plant
now
loaded
with
blossoms
scarlet
and
pale
purple
and
white
what
a
graceful
creature
it
is
garlanded
with
leaves
and
flowers
said
stella
as
she
approached
it
with
her
the
morning
after
her
arrival
it
looks
like
the
beginning
of
a
poem
or
some
place
that
should
come
into
a
story
has
nothing
ever
happened
there
let
me
see
hector
and
i
often
walk
to
and
fro
on
it
in
the
moonlight
when
the
nights
are
very
ah
if
you
were
only
had
to
part
you
know
thank
goodness
we
are
not
laughed
louise
not
lovers
oh
of
course
are
married
well
baby
you
are
as
wicked
as
ever
i
do
like
to
hear
hector
call
you
baby
you
see
though
you
may
be
very
and
serious
at
times
hector
best
remembers
you
as
the
baby
of
the
household
when
he
left
home
years
ago
what
ancient
folk
we
are
getting
to
be
sure
they
had
by
this
time
reached
the
bridge
which
was
provided
with
seats
on
each
side
and
was
indeed
much
resorted
to
as
a
sort
of
outside
it
was
a
point
of
vantage
and
commanded
a
good
view
of
the
country
round
eastward
there
were
low
ranges
between
those
and
lullaboolagana
lay
one
of
the
tracts
of
dead
trees
that
in
australian
scenery
make
up
so
weird
a
picture
of
desolation
it
was
known
as
the
wicked
wood
from
some
unknown
aboriginal
tradition
looking
steadily
northward
one
became
sensible
of
a
break
in
the
distant
woods
that
betokened
the
beginning
of
a
great
plain
which
stretched
many
scores
of
miles
in
that
direction
the
messmate
ranges
where
i
first
saw
a
the
wicked
wood
where
only
and
scorpions
live
the
weeloo
plain
where
a
buggy
seems
to
glide
along
like
a
is
just
as
it
was
over
three
years
ago
said
stella
looking
around
with
glad
recognition
here
the
indulged
in
one
of
those
long
wandering
and
delightful
chats
possible
only
to
people
who
have
had
interests
in
common
for
many
years
this
lasted
till
a
servant
came
to
announce
that
and
miss
morton
had
called
my
dear
how
you
have
grown
since
i
saw
you
were
morton
s
first
words
as
she
kissed
stella
this
is
julia
you
did
not
see
her
when
you
were
many
years
since
oh
a
dreadful
long
time
ago
said
stella
but
not
long
enough
for
me
to
have
grown
oh
but
positively
you
have
love
said
morton
surveying
the
new
arrival
with
fond
eyes
she
was
a
fair
stout
woman
long
past
middle
life
but
endowed
with
one
of
those
exuberantly
kind
natures
which
seem
to
defy
the
worst
inroads
of
age
she
certainly
never
wore
a
face
of
joy
merely
because
she
had
been
glad
of
yore
the
annals
of
daily
life
almost
invariably
supplied
her
with
food
for
wreathed
smiles
not
that
she
was
callous
to
the
accidents
that
marred
other
people
s
pleasures
though
mishaps
of
all
sorts
had
hitherto
been
unfamiliar
to
her
personally
only
though
she
knew
well
how
to
mourn
with
the
unfortunate
she
made
an
offering
to
oblivion
of
all
that
bordered
on
sorrow
in
an
incredibly
short
time
still
no
one
unconnected
with
a
local
catastrophe
took
it
to
heart
so
thoroughly
for
a
day
and
a
half
as
morton
did
and
on
this
very
occasion
she
gave
proof
of
this
oh
my
dear
have
you
heard
of
the
dreadful
accident
she
said
to
louise
after
a
few
casual
remarks
had
been
interchanged
accident
said
louise
a
little
startled
by
the
concern
depicted
on
morton
s
face
as
she
spoke
it
is
curious
how
the
people
who
feel
the
most
acutely
connect
any
show
of
deep
concern
with
personal
misadventure
well
it
was
at
morrison
s
yesterday
evening
we
called
at
one
of
the
minjah
shops
on
our
way
and
heard
all
about
it
a
man
came
in
from
the
bush
with
a
fearful
gumboil
morrison
found
the
tooth
would
have
to
come
out
he
put
the
man
under
chloroform
and
extracted
the
tooth
most
the
man
never
got
over
it
the
chloroform
killed
him
oh
my
dear
wasn
t
it
dreadful
and
morton
took
out
her
unnecessarily
for
the
tears
were
trickling
down
her
cheeks
oh
i
am
poor
dear
morrison
so
easily
upset
it
would
give
her
a
dreadful
shock
said
louise
that
is
the
best
of
using
ether
returned
morton
tearfully
if
it
hurts
the
patient
it
does
not
show
till
afterwards
but
for
a
man
to
die
under
your
getting
away
from
you
oh
it
is
so
very
shocking
but
after
all
mamma
said
her
daughter
he
was
quite
a
common
man
and
very
fond
of
well
julia
my
dear
if
you
were
his
wife
or
his
mother
or
his
sister
that
isn
t
the
way
you
would
speak
said
morton
wiping
her
eyes
it
s
of
them
i
but
he
didn
t
have
any
mamma
he
was
just
a
hand
on
the
oh
my
dear
not
have
a
mother
how
thoughtless
you
are
if
langdale
had
been
there
i
can
not
help
thinking
he
would
have
seen
the
man
couldn
t
stand
but
isn
t
langdale
there
he
was
here
the
day
before
yesterday
and
didn
t
say
a
word
of
leaving
for
any
length
of
he
is
at
nareen
staying
with
the
kenleighs
you
know
they
worship
the
ground
he
walks
on
since
he
performed
that
wonderfully
successful
operation
on
do
you
think
he
ll
really
stay
in
australia
courtland
said
miss
morton
i
do
not
know
answered
that
lady
i
am
afraid
not
you
see
it
was
not
to
stay
he
came
but
for
a
year
s
change
and
but
then
he
s
always
must
be
writing
a
book
said
the
young
lady
i
asked
morrison
the
other
week
whether
he
wasn
t
but
she
only
shook
her
head
and
smiled
i
don
t
know
why
some
people
are
so
fond
of
making
secrets
of
things
either
he
is
or
he
is
not
why
shouldn
t
she
say
yes
or
no
perhaps
she
doesn
t
really
know
answered
louise
smiling
she
knew
that
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
secret
was
abhorrent
to
miss
morton
who
loved
nothing
so
well
as
talking
of
other
people
s
affairs
except
talking
of
her
own
she
was
a
tall
young
woman
of
with
large
brown
eyes
a
brilliant
complexion
and
that
stamp
of
figure
which
milliners
call
the
visitors
stayed
for
many
hours
in
the
friendly
leisurely
fashion
of
neighbours
in
the
bush
who
are
separated
by
fifteen
miles
of
unpeopled
woods
miss
morton
had
three
weeks
previously
returned
from
a
visit
to
her
brother
john
morton
coming
back
by
way
of
melbourne
where
she
had
stayed
a
couple
of
days
with
tareling
i
would
have
seen
you
there
she
said
to
stella
only
you
were
so
long
in
coming
laurette
thought
you
were
going
to
give
her
up
altogether
what
a
dear
laurette
is
to
be
sure
to
this
stella
assented
in
the
facile
way
in
which
we
all
help
to
swell
social
fictions
i
do
not
feel
as
if
i
remembered
much
of
my
new
is
helen
like
julia
at
all
stella
asked
a
little
hesitatingly
after
the
mortons
had
gone
not
much
helen
takes
more
after
her
father
not
but
what
morton
is
the
dearest
and
kindest
of
women
you
will
like
helen
dear
said
louise
who
was
essentially
one
of
the
peacemakers
of
life
who
not
only
prophesy
smooth
things
but
help
materially
to
bring
them
to
pass
and
who
is
this
langdale
you
all
conspire
now
stella
i
warn
you
to
say
nothing
disparaging
said
louise
laughing
dr
langdale
is
an
immense
favourite
with
us
here
you
are
sure
to
see
him
as
soon
as
he
returns
from
nareen
he
strolls
across
from
morrison
s
house
in
minjah
millowie
most
days
in
the
afternoon
when
his
writing
for
the
day
is
over
he
does
write
for
hector
told
me
you
know
how
slowly
hector
makes
does
he
you
see
i
really
know
very
little
of
hector
and
i
always
forget
that
of
course
you
see
them
only
at
long
intervals
and
for
a
short
time
well
it
s
about
five
or
six
months
since
langdale
came
he
had
been
in
the
other
colonies
some
little
time
he
and
hector
became
great
cronies
almost
at
once
he
is
related
to
the
morrisons
we
heard
a
good
deal
about
him
before
he
arrived
he
has
inherited
a
pretty
good
income
and
does
not
need
to
work
for
his
living
but
he
always
had
a
great
liking
for
the
medical
profession
he
is
much
interested
too
in
all
sorts
of
social
questions
he
had
an
appointment
in
a
large
london
hospital
in
fact
he
has
never
practised
anywhere
else
he
previously
held
a
merely
honorary
post
there
for
two
or
three
years
then
an
great
physician
in
the
west
and
his
son
wished
langdale
to
enter
on
a
partnership
with
him
before
deciding
on
this
he
came
away
for
a
year
s
rest
and
how
old
is
he
about
only
like
most
englishmen
he
looks
younger
at
least
as
compared
with
australians
but
he
isn
t
all
english
he
is
german
on
the
mother
s
indeed
what
is
he
like
now
stella
you
are
interested
you
do
so
love
the
germans
i
know
you
will
like
langdale
if
only
for
that
yes
and
because
you
are
giving
me
such
a
vivid
description
of
him
said
stella
laughing
the
soft
flush
in
her
cheeks
would
have
shown
one
who
knew
her
that
she
was
more
interested
than
she
chose
to
appear
well
i
ll
do
my
best
only
the
moment
you
see
him
you
ll
oh
here
you
are
both
gossiping
away
nineteen
to
the
dozen
well
baby
are
you
tired
from
your
journey
yesterday
after
all
you
are
really
quite
grown
it
was
hector
courtland
who
made
this
little
speech
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
where
his
wife
and
sister
were
seated
with
lionel
the
eldest
boy
just
then
an
invalid
on
a
couch
buried
in
the
enchanted
pages
of
the
arabian
courtland
was
a
tall
spare
man
with
that
slight
stoop
which
tall
men
who
are
in
the
saddle
often
ten
hours
out
of
the
are
apt
to
acquire
he
was
bronzed
with
the
sun
and
constant
exposure
to
all
sorts
of
weather
he
was
barely
forty
but
his
hair
beard
and
moustache
were
plentifully
sprinkled
with
gray
his
face
when
in
repose
was
grave
almost
to
sadness
and
he
would
often
pass
hours
without
uttering
a
word
these
are
some
of
the
characteristics
of
a
life
passed
in
the
bush
from
early
manhood
courtland
had
been
at
eton
three
years
when
sudden
and
disastrous
reverses
coupled
with
failing
health
led
his
father
to
decide
on
leaving
england
for
australia
no
one
who
knew
hector
courtland
when
he
left
lad
of
have
prognosticated
that
he
would
become
grave
silent
and
uumirthful
long
before
he
reached
the
uplands
of
middle
age
but
there
are
probably
few
natures
which
are
not
profoundly
modified
by
a
existence
during
the
most
susceptible
years
of
life
you
look
tired
hector
wouldn
t
you
like
a
cup
of
tea
said
his
wife
yes
a
quart
potful
some
sheep
got
boxed
up
at
the
hut
and
we
had
a
high
old
time
of
it
drafting
them
well
liny
what
are
you
doing
young
man
reading
about
sindbad
the
sailor
father
do
you
know
that
aunt
stella
can
tell
stories
just
like
a
book
no
i
never
heard
her
what
sort
of
stories
the
one
she
told
me
this
morning
was
about
strange
people
who
live
always
in
the
what
kind
of
people
my
boy
well
when
they
are
in
the
sunshine
they
are
all
light
when
they
are
in
the
moonshine
it
goes
through
them
so
you
must
step
very
gently
and
follow
them
till
they
get
into
the
shadow
and
when
they
are
in
shadow
you
can
not
tell
them
from
the
then
it
seems
you
do
not
see
them
at
all
no
father
never
and
all
the
time
they
are
there
doing
the
strangest
things
they
catch
falling
stones
and
toss
them
back
into
the
sky
and
there
they
give
more
light
than
fever
and
don
t
fall
down
any
more
they
take
old
bits
of
dead
bark
and
make
them
into
butterfly
wings
with
gold
and
purple
spots
on
them
when
an
old
log
is
burnt
up
they
make
the
little
geraniums
that
smell
so
sweet
out
of
the
ashes
they
never
go
to
sleep
and
they
never
stop
working
and
they
are
never
tired
and
never
seen
and
they
never
let
the
tiniest
scrap
of
anything
go
to
the
father
listened
with
smiling
seriousness
to
these
wonders
of
the
wood
later
on
he
pleaded
to
be
among
the
audience
when
stella
told
twilight
stories
to
the
children
and
he
would
listen
with
profound
interest
to
the
mystical
events
and
subtle
fancies
that
rose
to
baby
s
lips
with
tireless
vivacity
she
certainly
had
something
of
the
improvisatrice
in
her
for
never
except
when
she
threw
the
reins
on
fancy
s
neck
in
speaking
did
such
winged
words
luminous
reaches
of
imagination
and
quick
touches
of
pathos
come
to
her
sometimes
when
the
grave
elder
brother
listened
he
would
almost
question
whether
this
could
be
the
merry
little
child
with
wide
open
eyes
who
had
been
the
baby
among
them
all
when
he
left
home
she
had
in
a
manner
remained
baby
to
him
ever
since
there
is
something
pathetic
in
the
way
that
those
who
are
most
closely
related
may
come
to
be
entire
strangers
when
we
are
in
daily
communion
we
inevitably
weave
fancies
one
concerning
the
other
which
stand
to
us
in
place
of
knowledge
but
all
the
not
only
dumb
natures
but
those
most
subtly
gifted
with
is
that
baffling
inexorable
wall
of
division
that
unfathomed
abyss
in
which
each
human
soul
is
shrouded
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
xxvii
it
might
seem
at
first
sight
that
station
life
in
australia
must
be
a
very
slow
and
dull
kind
of
existence
as
a
rule
the
centres
of
civilization
are
far
off
the
nearest
neighbours
many
miles
away
and
the
ordinary
modes
of
amusement
balls
parties
opera
and
are
unknown
to
many
no
doubt
a
life
so
cut
off
from
external
excitement
would
seem
a
very
maimed
and
incomplete
affair
but
on
the
other
hand
it
must
be
remembered
that
all
the
most
healthful
forms
of
recreation
as
opposed
to
are
opened
to
squatting
life
there
are
books
and
magazines
to
read
buggies
to
drive
in
horses
to
ride
visits
to
be
received
and
paid
and
all
the
engrossing
interests
of
family
life
for
the
for
the
men
there
is
the
ceaseless
round
of
duties
which
are
on
the
whole
not
more
monotonous
than
the
calling
of
average
professional
men
and
less
arduous
after
the
early
struggles
are
over
than
most
other
forms
of
work
and
then
who
has
lived
for
years
encircled
by
great
woods
without
finding
that
these
unpeopled
spaces
exercise
a
fascination
all
their
own
over
the
mind
the
tranquil
gullies
in
which
the
slender
stringy
grow
so
thick
that
every
is
intercepted
the
scrubby
ranges
which
the
radiant
epacris
sometimes
turn
into
a
mass
of
colour
the
swamps
with
their
wide
fringe
of
reeds
and
rushes
and
flocks
of
that
come
to
them
in
straggling
lines
from
far
districts
that
have
become
waterless
the
treeless
plains
that
stretch
like
a
mimic
ocean
to
the
verge
of
the
far
horizon
the
swelling
hills
that
break
the
monotony
of
undulating
country
the
sombre
vegetation
the
gleam
of
brilliant
desert
flowers
the
calls
and
songs
of
birds
all
have
a
charm
of
their
own
and
rise
up
in
the
memory
of
the
australian
exile
with
an
allurement
which
he
never
finds
in
the
crowded
not
even
in
the
scenery
of
the
old
world
stella
took
very
kindly
to
station
life
she
found
it
delightful
to
be
so
closely
neighboured
by
the
great
unmeasured
woods
of
her
native
land
she
even
regretted
that
the
township
of
minjah
millowie
was
so
near
the
views
she
liked
best
were
those
that
swept
the
woods
to
the
north
and
west
where
one
might
travel
on
and
on
for
days
without
striking
any
signs
of
human
habitation
next
day
she
was
on
the
bridge
alternately
absorbed
in
keats
and
in
looking
across
the
home
field
and
the
stirless
masses
of
foliage
beyond
when
she
heard
approaching
footsteps
she
turned
to
find
herself
face
to
face
with
her
unknown
partner
at
the
emberly
ball
miss
stella
is
it
possible
he
said
in
a
delighted
tone
they
shook
hands
cordially
i
believe
i
know
your
name
now
said
stella
laughingly
oh
it
is
langdale
did
you
not
know
that
night
no
but
since
i
came
here
things
i
have
heard
of
you
made
me
believe
that
langdale
and
you
were
one
and
the
he
laughed
with
beaming
eyes
at
this
division
of
his
individuality
well
i
knew
you
were
miss
stella
and
now
i
suppose
i
may
add
to
that
courtland
this
is
another
stroke
of
good
so
fleeting
i
hope
as
the
first
by
the
way
should
i
not
ask
whether
you
have
got
over
the
fatigues
of
the
ball
oh
yes
this
is
the
day
only
i
suppose
you
would
say
it
was
one
of
the
tragic
situations
of
life
that
one
can
never
really
make
believe
you
still
remember
our
little
debate
surely
tell
me
do
you
still
think
of
the
kritik
of
pure
reason
when
the
comes
before
you
are
going
to
a
ball
she
laughed
merrily
and
then
said
seriously
do
you
know
i
haven
t
been
to
any
ball
half
so
nice
and
i
haven
t
been
to
any
at
all
but
they
are
not
much
in
my
line
i
wonder
if
that
exquisite
tasmanian
is
still
flourishing
no
it
died
next
morning
of
pure
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
but
why
because
someone
near
it
began
an
anecdote
about
heine
and
then
went
away
without
telling
it
if
there
is
anything
in
the
world
a
tasmanian
can
not
brook
it
is
an
interrupted
well
i
felt
it
a
great
misfortune
that
your
partners
discovered
you
but
i
didn
t
know
the
sympathized
with
me
shall
i
tell
you
that
little
story
please
i
have
often
since
tried
to
imagine
what
it
it
was
told
to
my
mother
by
an
old
lady
who
knew
heine
she
visited
him
one
dull
day
in
november
a
little
over
two
years
before
his
death
she
found
him
spent
with
pain
that
had
defied
his
sleeping
potion
all
through
the
night
but
he
was
propped
up
on
his
writing
on
a
tablet
he
said
it
was
a
poem
which
like
life
had
turned
into
a
bad
joke
on
his
long
for
wit
and
too
pathetic
for
the
publishers
it
was
the
story
of
a
from
the
thuringian
woods
who
had
climbed
for
edelweiss
gathered
violets
before
sunrise
who
with
tears
in
their
eyes
told
him
why
their
petals
were
the
same
in
number
as
the
eggs
of
the
swallows
and
other
weighty
secrets
a
boy
who
made
love
to
the
stars
at
night
and
watched
a
maiden
spinning
till
he
believed
that
he
was
a
poet
he
came
to
beautiful
heathen
circe
who
slays
her
lovers
by
thousands
with
the
simples
she
culls
with
a
brazen
sickle
by
moonlight
but
her
simples
had
no
power
over
the
he
played
woodland
melodies
on
his
oaten
pipe
early
and
late
but
no
one
heeded
him
then
he
fell
ill
and
longed
even
to
death
for
a
sight
of
his
native
woods
but
most
of
all
for
one
of
the
white
violets
that
gretchen
used
to
wear
at
her
throat
then
the
evil
spirit
came
to
him
one
midnight
and
offered
him
a
white
violet
for
one
of
two
song
or
his
soul
the
boy
had
no
longer
the
power
to
make
a
song
in
the
cruel
city
that
had
broken
his
heart
so
he
gave
his
soul
he
held
the
flower
against
his
lips
but
when
the
dawn
crept
into
his
garret
he
saw
that
the
violet
was
a
purple
one
bleached
with
brimstone
then
without
a
word
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
and
died
they
say
he
looked
so
young
and
beautiful
that
beelzebub
himself
shed
tears
i
do
not
believe
this
part
of
the
story
however
said
heine
for
in
that
case
he
would
give
up
pinching
my
nerves
with
pincers
in
the
night
when
mathilde
is
asleep
and
there
is
no
one
to
drive
him
away
of
course
much
is
always
lost
when
a
thing
of
that
kind
is
repeated
from
one
to
the
other
but
that
is
the
little
anecdote
as
my
mother
told
it
me
as
nearly
as
i
can
well
i
think
it
has
heine
s
cachet
on
it
poor
heine
it
seems
like
a
peep
into
his
room
where
he
lay
so
cruelly
long
yes
it
was
a
bitter
lingering
as
he
said
in
one
of
his
letters
he
was
no
somewhat
comely
greek
any
more
who
would
laugh
merrily
at
morose
nazarenes
but
only
a
poor
jew
sick
to
death
a
wasted
picture
of
sorrow
an
unhappy
what
a
crown
of
thorns
life
has
for
the
most
part
offered
to
the
that
is
true
but
we
must
not
forget
that
they
themselves
plaited
the
thorns
too
often
just
as
we
other
ordinary
mortals
ah
but
they
suffer
more
they
have
less
certainty
of
waking
bliss
genius
has
never
been
truly
acclimatized
in
the
world
the
philistines
always
long
to
put
out
the
eyes
of
poets
and
make
them
grind
corn
at
there
was
a
touch
of
scorn
in
stella
s
voice
and
a
light
in
her
eyes
which
were
not
lost
on
her
companion
who
indeed
found
an
evident
pleasure
in
looking
at
her
as
well
as
hearing
her
speak
but
you
must
not
forget
that
poets
are
by
nature
very
vocal
and
able
to
record
their
joys
and
woes
with
cunning
effect
now
take
the
dumb
patient
way
in
which
the
among
them
it
is
nothing
uncommon
to
find
a
woman
has
been
enduring
acute
pain
at
intervals
for
years
and
all
the
time
going
about
her
work
as
if
nothing
were
the
matter
and
saying
very
little
about
it
that
to
my
mind
is
true
heroism
if
a
poet
could
ever
suffer
in
the
same
way
for
a
month
gods
what
despairing
declamatory
appeals
to
an
unrighteous
heaven
you
talk
almost
like
a
perhaps
i
say
what
appears
to
me
true
that
is
often
the
worst
sort
of
but
surely
not
if
your
truth
is
really
true
said
stella
with
an
arch
smile
ah
that
is
a
burning
question
returned
langdale
with
an
answering
smile
but
without
going
into
the
more
serious
aspect
of
we
should
not
choose
to
be
in
are
there
not
many
things
in
which
illusions
help
people
more
than
the
truth
isn
t
that
perhaps
one
reason
why
things
as
they
are
remain
for
the
most
part
so
carefully
masked
i
must
think
over
that
before
i
commit
myself
but
about
the
poets
isn
t
it
their
vocation
to
see
the
passionate
expression
not
only
in
the
face
of
all
science
but
to
put
into
words
what
others
dumbly
endure
when
shelley
says
i
could
lie
down
like
a
tired
child
and
weep
away
this
life
of
care
which
i
have
borne
and
still
must
bear
he
was
speaking
not
only
for
himself
but
for
multitudes
who
have
had
the
same
feeling
but
lacked
all
gift
of
that
just
points
what
i
wanted
to
say
a
feeling
of
that
kind
is
after
all
fleeting
it
takes
up
but
a
small
part
of
a
working
day
and
a
working
day
is
on
the
whole
a
hopeful
one
only
the
things
that
make
it
so
would
not
produce
a
lyrical
that
sounds
so
reasonable
it
is
more
provoking
than
a
downright
no
but
really
it
is
so
think
what
it
takes
of
endeavour
of
effort
to
make
up
one
day
of
this
world
s
life
most
of
this
may
be
called
downright
drudgery
things
that
have
to
be
done
over
and
over
again
in
almost
exactly
the
same
way
simply
because
people
need
three
meals
a
day
and
yet
the
work
done
has
its
own
interest
to
each
healthy
what
to
the
women
who
make
buttonholes
all
their
lives
and
make
dolls
arms
for
a
shilling
the
hundred
dozen
to
the
men
who
break
stones
for
the
road
and
work
in
gangs
in
factories
and
mines
underground
do
not
forget
said
langdale
with
a
smile
that
you
are
thinking
of
these
monotonous
employments
with
a
highly
sensitized
imagination
and
even
when
the
work
is
in
far
more
imaginative
it
brings
the
mind
into
touch
with
things
that
do
not
pass
away
with
the
much
more
effective
for
poetry
is
the
reaction
the
mistrust
the
vague
disappointment
than
the
moderate
satisfaction
at
moderate
feeling
of
expectation
and
looking
on
and
waiting
for
what
is
to
follow
which
after
all
give
their
zest
to
the
average
days
of
existence
well
are
we
to
come
back
to
the
old
idea
of
banishing
poesy
because
it
is
misleading
by
no
means
only
i
think
we
do
not
enough
realize
its
tendency
to
heighten
what
is
sad
in
i
think
to
exaggerate
it
it
isn
t
the
people
who
have
most
to
do
with
life
that
write
criticisms
on
it
and
in
all
criticisms
there
is
a
heightening
and
a
deepening
it
is
the
craft
of
the
ready
you
make
me
think
of
an
expression
people
often
use
when
anything
dreadful
it
is
like
a
dream
and
yet
the
worst
things
always
happen
when
we
are
wide
awake
still
i
feel
the
force
of
what
you
say
about
the
poor
i
have
often
been
struck
with
the
uncomplaining
almost
stoical
way
in
which
they
take
yes
one
can
not
help
being
struck
with
it
it
does
feel
rather
bad
they
will
say
when
intolerable
agony
would
be
our
only
adequate
expression
for
what
they
are
enduring
and
how
simply
often
they
face
death
i
wouldn
t
mind
going
if
it
weren
t
for
the
children
i
have
heard
poor
women
say
over
and
over
again
what
a
sinewy
insinuating
expression
for
passing
away
from
all
that
we
know
there
is
no
art
of
the
rhetorician
the
shoemaker
who
can
make
a
great
shoe
for
a
little
the
two
had
left
the
bridge
by
this
time
and
were
slowly
sauntering
through
the
home
field
towards
the
house
it
was
the
afternoon
of
one
of
those
perfect
australian
days
in
which
the
sky
is
widely
vaulted
in
a
dome
of
crystalline
clearness
the
horizons
so
indefinitely
enlarged
that
the
are
beyond
sight
the
world
overflowing
with
sunshine
as
though
day
had
been
added
to
day
while
a
cool
westerly
breeze
was
blowing
that
stirred
the
boughs
into
jocund
sprightliness
and
revealed
in
the
searching
light
how
large
the
buds
were
growing
on
the
limes
and
birches
and
all
the
trees
that
lose
their
foliage
in
winter
you
almost
tempt
me
to
think
that
it
is
more
poetical
to
be
to
dumb
forgetfulness
a
prey
than
to
interpret
nature
and
our
own
hearts
to
us
said
stella
but
still
i
suppose
you
do
love
the
poets
a
little
fortunately
i
have
got
a
voucher
with
me
he
returned
laughingly
and
pulled
a
small
brown
volume
of
molière
out
of
his
pocket
ah
that
is
one
of
the
beloved
among
the
classics
one
reads
him
each
time
as
if
the
first
yes
as
i
walked
from
minjah
millowie
i
laughed
over
harpagon
s
instructions
to
his
servants
to
conceal
the
defects
of
their
liveries
as
if
i
had
never
read
them
before
is
there
anyone
else
who
has
the
secret
of
touching
the
springs
of
laughter
so
irresistibly
and
it
isn
t
so
much
with
broad
effects
or
even
the
finer
point
of
wit
but
the
perpetual
play
of
the
human
ironical
surprises
life
has
in
store
for
you
make
me
long
to
steal
the
volume
from
you
i
don
t
think
i
have
read
l
avare
for
suppose
we
exchange
i
know
keats
very
imperfectly
this
is
just
the
atmosphere
in
which
to
read
him
now
that
is
a
sort
of
pledge
of
friendship
he
said
as
they
exchanged
books
yes
so
it
is
answered
stella
heartily
do
you
know
i
often
wondered
if
we
should
meet
again
he
went
on
i
quite
made
up
my
mind
that
we
might
be
friends
if
we
did
if
you
will
forgive
such
so
did
i
returned
stella
frankly
and
she
recalled
her
conversation
with
her
sister
at
coonjooree
thank
you
very
much
he
returned
with
a
simple
cordiality
which
was
a
marked
trait
in
his
manner
i
foresee
that
we
shall
quarrel
occasionally
he
continued
gaily
a
little
afterwards
yes
there
is
an
exasperating
reasonableness
about
you
she
said
with
a
soberness
only
belied
by
the
dancing
light
in
her
eyes
and
that
must
breed
mischief
sometimes
i
suppose
it
comes
of
your
belonging
to
two
old
civilizations
firmly
rooted
in
the
he
maintained
his
gravity
till
her
eyes
betrayed
her
and
then
they
laughed
together
you
have
a
way
of
taking
temporary
rises
out
of
me
which
you
must
expect
to
hear
of
again
he
said
and
this
threat
made
food
for
more
laughter
and
then
at
that
moment
louise
accompanied
by
two
or
three
little
ones
came
in
sight
among
the
trees
what
will
my
think
said
stella
with
an
amused
smile
she
does
not
know
we
are
old
what
louise
thought
as
she
approached
the
two
was
that
they
looked
extremely
companionable
stella
was
attired
in
a
cashmere
with
a
cluster
of
at
her
throat
and
a
broad
straw
hat
looped
up
at
one
side
with
the
same
flowers
a
smile
hovered
about
her
lips
and
as
she
talked
her
long
thick
lashes
and
dark
slender
eyebrows
heightened
the
radiance
of
her
eyes
and
cheeks
her
companion
was
little
over
a
head
taller
with
a
muscular
figure
his
eyes
were
dark
gray
his
head
and
brow
strikingly
air
well
maintained
by
the
rest
of
the
face
more
especially
the
chin
and
mouth
whose
short
upper
lip
was
defined
rather
than
hidden
by
a
silky
black
moustache
his
hair
was
of
the
same
colour
his
skin
a
clear
olive
tint
i
do
not
think
i
need
offer
to
introduce
you
to
one
another
said
louise
smiling
well
no
we
have
just
been
finishing
a
talk
we
began
the
day
after
i
landed
in
australia
said
langdale
and
then
louise
was
speedily
told
all
there
was
to
tell
you
were
sitting
on
the
bridge
then
when
you
met
langdale
said
louise
afterwards
when
the
two
were
alone
well
something
has
happened
there
at
last
for
don
t
you
think
under
the
circumstances
it
was
almost
an
event
oh
yes
it
an
event
for
we
are
going
to
be
louise
might
smile
covertly
and
feel
as
sceptical
as
people
usually
are
regarding
friendship
pure
and
simple
between
an
attractive
young
woman
and
a
man
barely
eight
years
her
senior
but
stella
who
was
weary
of
being
made
love
to
found
this
prospect
of
friendship
very
alluring
and
from
the
first
moment
she
met
him
something
which
she
could
feel
though
not
define
made
her
feel
sure
that
langdale
was
a
man
capable
of
being
an
intimate
friend
without
degenerating
into
a
lover
xxviii
there
come
epochs
in
some
lives
to
which
the
thoughts
in
all
return
with
infinite
tenderness
and
a
vague
wonder
that
in
an
existence
so
beset
with
common
pleasures
and
turmoils
and
disillusions
there
should
be
this
tranquil
sanctuary
by
which
always
there
seem
to
glide
the
sweet
waters
of
siloe
that
go
with
silence
such
a
period
for
stella
were
the
weeks
that
followed
the
spring
was
an
unusually
lovely
overflowing
with
sunshine
and
yet
cool
our
australian
woods
do
not
greatly
brighten
or
darken
at
the
approach
of
any
season
and
the
monotony
of
form
and
colour
must
often
deepen
the
tendency
of
all
objects
to
fail
in
making
us
apprehend
our
surroundings
with
eyes
quickened
by
imaginative
insight
but
here
at
lullaboolagana
there
were
groves
and
little
woods
of
european
trees
whose
bare
branches
were
starred
with
that
swelled
from
day
to
day
in
the
liberal
sunlight
and
the
kindly
air
making
the
heart
beat
with
involuntary
gladness
at
their
revelation
of
the
dawn
of
returning
youth
this
miracle
perpetually
renewed
of
vegetable
life
so
largely
drawn
from
unseen
material
has
a
subtle
power
to
draw
the
mind
into
wondering
conjecture
as
to
presences
unknown
as
well
as
unseen
which
may
be
all
around
and
near
us
it
seemed
to
stella
as
if
she
fully
felt
for
the
first
time
the
mystical
significance
of
this
ceaseless
throb
of
returning
vigour
and
then
the
growing
intimacy
with
a
mind
equipped
by
training
and
natural
endowments
with
a
keen
apprehension
of
the
more
novel
forces
that
are
moulding
thought
and
life
in
the
present
too
with
a
calmer
more
assured
outlook
on
life
than
had
yet
dawned
on
her
introspective
more
apprehensive
nature
seemed
in
a
delightful
way
to
realize
that
ideal
of
friendship
she
found
so
attractive
they
had
so
much
in
common
and
yet
they
were
so
wide
apart
and
this
led
them
often
far
afield
in
talk
which
though
at
first
chiefly
impersonal
yet
led
to
a
growing
sympathy
this
may
be
better
realized
by
recording
though
imperfectly
some
of
the
talk
that
passed
between
them
on
successive
occasions
the
second
time
they
met
at
lullaboolagana
was
on
the
wide
western
veranda
closed
with
a
thick
screen
of
creepers
where
stella
sat
sewing
beside
her
little
invalid
nephew
i
wish
you
had
come
in
time
to
hear
aunt
stella
s
story
of
the
little
lost
angel
said
the
boy
well
hadn
t
you
better
tell
it
to
me
liny
said
langdale
coaxingly
lionel
nothing
was
one
of
the
children
who
like
to
tell
a
story
almost
as
much
as
to
hear
in
his
own
way
the
strange
adventures
of
a
little
angel
who
viewing
the
earth
a
long
way
off
fell
in
love
with
it
and
came
to
see
it
closer
he
could
fly
down
easily
but
his
wings
were
not
strong
enough
to
bear
him
back
there
was
a
little
cottage
in
the
woods
in
which
a
girl
and
her
mother
lived
the
girl
found
the
little
angel
wet
with
the
dew
and
blue
with
the
cold
and
brought
him
home
when
his
wings
had
dried
the
mother
plucked
most
of
the
feathers
out
to
stuff
a
pillow
with
them
this
grieved
the
angel
so
much
that
he
wandered
off
to
the
woods
and
sat
in
a
very
lonely
place
waiting
for
his
wings
to
grow
again
but
the
deafened
him
with
their
buzzing
the
crows
tried
to
peck
his
eyes
out
and
at
last
an
emu
put
sand
over
him
so
that
he
might
be
hatched
like
one
of
her
own
chicks
that
is
all
said
the
boy
aunt
stella
won
t
say
whether
the
angel
grew
its
wings
or
was
choked
i
think
myself
the
sand
would
smother
make
it
blind
poor
dear
little
angel
i
wonder
why
your
aunt
told
you
such
a
dofeful
story
as
that
said
langdale
speaking
to
the
boy
but
looking
at
the
culprit
who
showed
no
signs
of
repentance
are
you
of
the
same
persuasion
as
my
sister
louise
said
stella
when
she
tells
the
children
stories
they
are
lightened
of
all
the
babes
in
the
wood
have
a
happy
time
in
the
well
don
t
you
think
the
chief
justification
of
stories
is
that
they
are
pleasanter
than
the
worst
that
may
happen
do
you
really
think
so
said
stella
looking
very
sceptical
yes
i
do
i
have
a
grievance
on
this
point
i
am
fond
of
and
always
have
been
now
if
you
begin
to
read
stories
at
eight
by
the
time
you
get
to
be
you
are
at
the
mercy
of
contemporaries
for
fiction
oh
i
assure
you
some
of
my
contemporaries
who
write
novels
would
fare
very
badly
if
they
fell
into
my
hands
what
doleful
evenings
they
have
given
me
when
the
day
s
work
was
over
and
i
have
sat
down
in
solitude
proposing
to
forget
problems
and
maladies
and
the
imbecile
people
who
so
constantly
beset
us
in
life
but
no
the
modern
novelist
instead
of
taking
the
good
the
gods
provide
us
in
wholesome
cheerful
lives
shows
invention
in
nothing
but
incredible
disasters
if
they
give
us
anything
new
it
is
in
the
way
of
fools
and
diseases
and
villains
and
every
conceivable
shade
of
human
while
all
the
time
you
want
a
glorified
arcadia
where
all
the
good
people
are
happy
and
the
wicked
ones
either
overthrown
or
turned
from
the
evil
of
their
ways
or
why
don
t
you
say
ignored
think
how
intolerable
human
society
would
be
if
people
were
not
agreed
to
ignore
a
great
deal
and
rightly
i
do
wish
you
would
give
me
some
idea
of
what
your
favourite
novels
should
be
at
between
hiding
away
the
misery
of
life
and
ignoring
the
evil
of
can
only
think
of
fairy
tales
with
the
fairies
left
well
you
amuse
me
here
are
you
quite
evidently
blessed
with
a
physique
without
all
your
time
to
spend
in
the
way
that
seems
best
to
money
position
and
friends
and
a
healthy
capacity
of
yet
you
affect
to
believe
that
books
can
not
be
real
unless
they
are
waking
nightmares
of
but
how
could
a
tale
be
made
that
anyone
would
read
out
of
good
health
and
immunity
from
destitution
not
that
i
am
one
of
those
happy
beings
for
i
am
awfully
poor
said
stella
are
you
really
said
langdale
looking
curiously
at
the
pale
pink
de
which
was
one
of
stella
s
favourite
materials
of
wear
yes
i
have
only
thirteen
pounds
a
quarter
for
what
for
rent
and
food
and
the
incidence
of
taxation
you
must
manage
very
oh
you
are
laughing
at
me
of
course
i
mean
for
my
and
do
you
mean
to
say
you
are
poor
upon
that
yes
the
worst
of
all
poverty
debt
my
is
full
of
entries
in
my
brother
tom
s
handwriting
lent
this
day
to
stella
five
pounds
to
be
paid
again
to
me
when
she
can
i
say
five
pounds
that
has
a
very
sound
said
langdale
smiling
oh
yes
and
after
these
notes
i
also
write
i
owe
unto
tom
five
pounds
lawful
money
of
australia
which
i
did
borrow
of
him
heaven
grant
he
may
get
it
back
but
this
is
a
not
at
all
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
answered
langdale
speaking
quite
gravely
but
with
a
lurking
smile
in
his
eyes
a
young
lady
who
has
pounds
a
year
and
sundry
for
mere
dresses
and
ribbons
and
yet
is
desperately
poor
is
just
fit
to
be
a
member
of
that
growing
fraternity
of
malcontents
who
are
so
ready
to
rail
at
nature
and
now
you
are
quite
mistaken
said
stella
with
equal
gravity
it
was
only
yesterday
afternoon
i
saw
a
swoop
down
and
swallow
a
great
that
dunstan
our
gardener
turned
over
and
yet
i
asked
neither
providence
nor
nature
a
single
question
it
was
an
ugly
creature
and
i
was
quite
content
it
should
be
gobbled
up
out
of
this
delicate
insinuation
that
when
we
find
little
to
complain
of
in
life
it
is
because
we
ourselves
are
protected
from
the
worst
barbs
of
misfortune
was
not
lost
on
langdale
but
then
an
angel
is
higher
up
in
the
to
our
own
sacred
caste
of
humanity
he
said
with
a
quiet
smile
and
so
you
protest
against
accident
to
one
of
these
by
making
a
poignant
little
tale
out
of
its
disasters
how
characteristic
that
is
of
so
much
of
our
modern
literature
which
piles
up
often
the
outward
accidents
of
existence
and
all
the
time
leaves
out
its
very
tell
me
what
you
think
is
left
life
itself
the
strong
warm
instinct
of
clinging
to
the
earth
even
when
its
harvests
do
not
whiten
fully
to
allay
our
instinct
that
makes
the
man
who
has
writhed
in
pain
through
the
night
carry
food
in
trembling
spoonfuls
to
his
lips
in
the
morning
while
a
glow
of
thankfulness
rises
in
his
heart
because
he
yet
lives
to
see
the
light
of
it
is
a
subtle
ensnaring
game
this
life
of
ours
and
to
am
sure
of
very
fact
of
being
alive
is
a
good
that
outweighs
the
bitterest
and
yet
you
have
been
so
often
in
the
presence
of
the
terrors
of
life
in
london
there
must
be
swarms
of
people
about
whom
everyone
must
feel
it
would
be
better
if
they
never
saw
the
light
it
seems
to
me
that
in
hospitals
and
a
doctor
must
often
feel
that
death
rather
than
life
would
be
the
great
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
i
am
very
callous
said
langdale
with
a
smile
but
such
a
thought
has
very
seldom
forced
itself
on
me
and
when
it
has
i
have
rejected
it
as
treasonable
i
dare
say
you
are
right
habit
may
engender
a
bias
on
the
side
of
life
apart
from
its
conditions
fortunately
for
us
we
have
only
to
take
one
part
at
a
time
in
the
stage
of
yes
you
are
concerned
with
pulling
a
man
through
not
with
the
question
whether
it
is
worth
while
now
i
am
one
of
the
at
the
play
i
do
not
hold
a
retaining
fee
on
one
side
or
the
other
and
so
i
perceive
how
unmoral
this
ardour
for
prolonging
this
existence
really
stella
spoke
with
extreme
gravity
but
seeing
that
langdale
really
thought
she
was
in
earnest
she
could
not
refrain
from
laughter
it
is
very
charitable
of
you
to
assume
that
this
ardour
for
keeping
people
in
life
counts
for
so
much
he
said
smiling
but
joking
aside
he
added
after
a
pause
there
is
an
absorbing
interest
often
in
watching
how
incredibly
near
a
human
being
may
draw
to
the
unknown
bourne
and
yet
struggle
back
to
health
once
more
what
is
the
subtlety
of
man
compared
to
the
subtlety
of
nature
someone
has
said
and
nature
is
in
nothing
so
subtle
as
the
extraordinary
rallies
she
makes
on
the
side
of
life
and
thus
in
a
great
crisis
when
one
pang
of
remorse
or
a
dark
foreboding
as
to
the
future
might
turn
the
scales
against
recovery
the
senses
are
wrapped
in
unconsciousness
as
impenetrable
as
that
of
early
you
make
me
feel
that
a
struggle
against
death
might
be
more
entertaining
to
watch
than
the
life
that
but
when
you
are
a
little
older
you
will
find
that
the
great
thing
is
the
game
itself
returned
langdale
with
the
frank
catching
smile
characteristic
of
him
the
endless
interaction
of
motive
and
expectation
of
work
and
play
of
the
wider
outlook
on
human
affairs
which
is
so
distinctive
of
modern
days
lend
the
world
an
interest
that
outbalances
its
yes
as
long
as
we
do
not
try
to
peer
below
the
surface
returned
stella
half
smilingly
and
then
went
on
langdale
there
is
a
strong
element
of
in
the
world
apart
from
moral
or
deeply
serious
considerations
so
much
interplay
that
lightens
even
in
the
wards
of
a
hospital
yes
i
had
to
laugh
as
i
rode
out
yesterday
recalling
a
case
that
was
admitted
into
our
casual
ward
a
week
or
two
before
i
left
hospital
it
was
a
man
who
had
been
run
over
and
whose
head
was
badly
hurt
it
appears
he
had
been
drinking
for
some
time
he
explained
to
me
as
he
was
getting
better
that
he
was
a
poet
whose
ideas
would
flow
only
under
alcoholic
stimulant
this
unfortunate
accident
made
him
lose
the
thread
of
a
great
epic
which
would
have
made
his
fame
oh
what
was
was
it
he
would
say
and
then
he
would
implore
me
to
help
to
recover
his
epic
it
was
a
theme
colossal
in
its
grandeur
and
yet
full
of
pathos
and
interest
i
suggested
heaven
and
hell
ah
don
t
you
see
that
when
people
have
ceased
to
hope
for
one
or
fear
the
other
such
a
theme
is
impossible
besides
he
said
the
critics
would
at
once
say
i
was
imitating
dante
and
milton
then
i
said
a
great
dethroned
etc
a
monarch
he
said
in
a
tone
of
disdain
a
creature
that
nowadays
has
either
to
ape
the
manners
of
the
common
herd
or
keep
himself
locked
up
like
a
criminal
woman
then
i
said
in
despair
oh
who
broke
my
head
and
has
storied
the
prophets
in
every
he
replied
beginning
to
they
both
laughed
at
this
reminiscence
then
courtland
and
the
governess
joined
them
and
the
conversation
became
general
xxix
three
weeks
of
stella
s
visit
at
lullaboolagana
had
passed
when
her
brother
claude
and
his
young
wife
returned
from
their
travels
it
had
been
arranged
that
they
were
to
live
at
the
head
station
a
year
or
two
before
starting
an
establishment
on
their
own
account
claude
was
a
vivacious
young
woman
who
as
is
the
wont
of
travellers
had
brought
back
many
tales
of
the
countries
she
had
seen
they
had
spent
february
and
march
in
england
among
relations
on
both
sides
and
this
on
the
whole
was
the
part
of
their
foreign
experience
which
oftenest
afforded
themes
of
reminiscence
some
days
would
begin
bright
she
would
say
and
then
all
at
once
a
fog
would
come
on
after
peering
into
the
sky
for
some
time
you
would
find
the
sun
in
the
most
awkward
position
looking
for
all
the
world
like
an
old
platter
but
even
when
there
was
no
fog
you
would
think
the
sky
was
coming
down
on
top
of
you
it
was
so
awfully
low
and
dark
and
all
the
trees
used
to
long
to
put
a
petticoat
on
the
poor
things
and
at
uncle
courtland
s
rectory
in
devonshire
i
found
a
little
blue
gum
trying
to
live
oh
dear
i
nearly
cried
over
why
well
you
must
have
been
homesick
said
louise
well
i
don
t
at
any
rate
i
was
very
dull
they
went
to
church
so
often
and
i
felt
i
ought
to
go
too
one
of
the
girls
had
been
to
girton
and
she
is
a
little
like
stella
in
some
the
rest
seem
to
look
on
her
as
a
pagan
i
couldn
t
believe
you
had
more
sunshine
here
than
you
liked
you
begin
to
understand
why
english
people
laugh
so
but
do
they
questioned
stella
who
was
listening
and
sewing
by
a
french
window
that
opened
on
the
veranda
i
think
all
the
english
people
i
have
known
laughed
as
much
as
we
do
and
what
other
nation
has
produced
such
humorists
oh
yes
long
ago
now
they
laugh
most
when
they
are
langdale
i
should
think
there
must
be
millions
of
women
in
england
who
never
laughed
out
in
all
their
lives
i
suppose
that
s
why
they
take
everything
so
seriously
if
you
re
five
minutes
late
for
breakfast
they
look
at
you
as
if
you
had
stabbed
the
worse
for
they
would
say
a
cook
can
be
replaced
but
if
you
waste
the
time
you
can
never
get
it
you
see
dear
we
get
rather
lax
ideas
of
punctuality
in
the
long
hot
summers
said
louise
apologetically
oh
my
goodness
how
i
should
like
to
see
some
of
our
relations
on
their
bedroom
floors
instead
of
seeing
that
everyone
is
at
the
table
to
the
minute
such
a
fuss
over
wasting
the
time
claude
says
it
s
part
of
cant
what
better
can
you
do
when
the
sun
never
shows
himself
you
speak
as
though
you
had
been
rather
in
a
wet
blanket
there
said
stella
smiling
and
found
the
people
rather
now
i
think
nice
english
people
are
the
nicest
of
yea
in
australia
away
from
the
rest
said
nell
with
a
sparkle
in
her
eyes
but
a
houseful
gets
upon
the
as
for
a
whole
country
full
of
them
nothing
but
the
thought
of
leaving
it
for
australia
say
keeps
you
up
i
can
see
you
don
t
take
that
in
quite
but
wait
till
you
go
there
stella
i
don
t
believe
you
would
stay
two
days
at
your
uncle
s
they
are
for
ever
talking
of
church
and
the
no
doubt
claude
could
have
enlarged
eloquently
on
the
subject
had
it
not
been
cut
short
by
the
entrance
of
her
mother
and
sister
julia
who
were
speedily
followed
by
langdale
he
stayed
only
a
few
minutes
however
being
on
his
way
to
nareen
and
having
merely
called
with
a
book
for
stella
morton
could
never
see
langdale
without
entering
on
conjectures
as
to
whether
he
might
not
settle
in
victoria
instead
of
returning
to
london
when
his
year
was
up
we
do
so
need
good
doctors
in
this
country
she
said
and
really
the
young
men
who
take
their
degrees
in
melbourne
and
sydney
seem
anxious
to
cut
people
up
just
out
of
curiosity
to
see
what
s
inside
there
was
a
general
laugh
at
this
but
morton
did
not
speak
in
a
joking
spirit
indeed
girls
it
is
true
there
was
that
young
jones
at
warracootie
not
a
fowl
could
they
keep
he
was
trying
to
invent
a
liver
pill
and
used
to
try
its
effects
on
hens
and
ducks
they
all
died
in
convulsions
he
said
it
was
in
the
sacred
cause
of
science
and
surely
it
s
better
to
have
your
own
eggs
fresh
laid
and
then
if
he
knew
as
much
about
the
liver
as
he
should
would
his
pills
act
in
that
way
but
for
all
we
know
langdale
may
be
engaged
to
be
married
and
obliged
to
return
said
miss
morton
and
she
managed
to
watch
stella
s
face
as
she
spoke
but
she
did
not
glean
anything
from
the
survey
then
claude
who
knew
the
rather
callous
way
in
which
her
sister
was
prone
to
investigate
and
thresh
out
any
subject
that
interested
her
changed
the
conversation
but
the
subject
was
one
on
which
miss
morton
was
conscious
of
an
aching
void
for
information
and
next
sunday
when
claude
and
his
wife
were
spending
the
day
at
broadmead
the
morton
station
miss
julia
returned
to
the
subject
again
she
was
a
young
woman
who
took
her
prospect
of
settling
in
life
as
she
would
have
called
it
very
seriously
it
was
now
nearly
three
years
and
a
half
since
she
and
ritchie
had
been
as
she
thought
on
the
verge
of
becoming
engaged
she
had
had
frequent
opportunities
of
meeting
him
during
her
visits
to
her
brother
and
his
wife
ted
s
elder
sister
she
believed
that
ted
still
admired
her
a
good
she
formed
in
fact
a
sort
of
second
string
to
his
bow
which
he
would
soon
fall
back
on
if
only
he
were
finally
convinced
that
stella
was
not
to
be
won
or
better
still
if
stella
married
this
was
a
calculating
not
to
say
mercenary
way
of
looking
upon
marriage
for
a
young
woman
of
but
we
sometimes
forget
that
the
freedom
of
choice
in
marriage
which
it
permitted
to
women
of
the
race
has
the
effect
of
making
some
of
them
regard
the
institution
on
cool
business
principles
it
is
an
arrangement
made
by
themselves
instead
of
by
the
mothers
as
in
france
indeed
no
french
mother
could
go
to
work
in
a
more
disenchanted
way
in
this
respect
than
a
certain
type
of
australian
girl
i
am
getting
on
in
life
she
will
say
examining
the
corners
of
her
eyes
and
the
parting
of
her
hair
critically
and
then
she
counts
over
the
number
of
eligible
men
in
her
circle
and
makes
a
mental
tick
against
the
name
of
the
one
who
combines
most
money
with
good
looks
if
he
dies
or
marries
the
wrong
woman
the
process
of
ticking
has
to
be
gone
over
again
but
to
do
miss
morton
justice
affection
though
not
of
an
absorbing
nature
had
something
to
do
with
her
designs
on
ted
ritchie
she
could
readily
have
loved
him
and
would
much
sooner
have
married
him
than
say
the
dissipated
younger
son
of
an
english
peer
as
her
friend
laurette
had
done
she
had
indeed
during
the
period
when
ted
seemed
seriously
bent
on
coming
to
the
point
discarded
a
local
suitor
who
was
quite
as
wealthy
as
the
recreant
knight
but
twenty
years
older
and
with
a
fringe
of
crimson
hair
scantily
surrounding
a
singularly
flat
crown
his
eyes
too
were
of
the
protruding
order
and
his
chin
fell
away
a
good
deal
altogether
he
had
very
much
the
look
of
a
frog
that
has
lived
through
many
winters
still
he
had
fifteen
thousand
a
year
and
such
an
income
always
placed
a
marriage
above
the
odious
category
of
scratch
matches
but
he
was
a
shy
sort
of
creature
and
seemed
to
have
taken
a
woman
s
no
as
being
final
he
would
doubtless
require
unmistakable
tokens
of
goodwill
to
bring
him
to
the
point
once
more
now
though
miss
morton
was
not
romantic
in
her
disposition
though
she
had
started
in
life
with
few
ideals
while
those
that
she
had
were
of
a
tough
serviceable
kind
yet
she
hesitated
and
delayed
showing
those
tokens
while
ted
was
still
in
the
land
of
the
other
words
unmarried
if
she
could
only
write
to
tell
laurette
that
stella
was
engaged
before
she
left
melbourne
the
two
had
canvassed
the
whole
affair
in
that
exhaustive
unreserved
fashion
habitual
to
many
women
in
talking
over
their
own
and
other
people
s
affairs
i
consider
stella
as
good
as
engaged
to
ted
after
all
that
has
passed
laurette
had
said
and
when
julia
came
home
it
was
with
a
fixed
resolve
to
regard
ted
as
no
longer
among
the
quick
and
she
had
even
planned
those
overtures
which
would
convince
timothy
haydon
that
though
a
girl
might
decline
to
leave
the
parental
roof
over
three
years
ago
it
did
not
follow
that
she
would
always
be
in
that
negative
mood
he
would
come
home
with
them
from
church
one
sunday
as
he
sometimes
did
and
a
little
accidental
stroll
in
the
garden
together
and
a
judicious
leading
would
surely
be
enough
but
then
before
this
visit
or
stroll
came
off
she
found
that
stella
courtland
and
langdale
were
as
thick
as
two
thieves
as
she
expressed
it
in
writing
to
laurette
on
getting
this
letter
laurette
had
instantly
written
back
asking
julia
to
be
sure
to
let
her
know
if
anything
happened
it
was
rather
early
days
for
anything
to
have
happened
in
laurette
s
sense
of
the
term
but
then
speedy
wooings
are
not
rare
in
australia
especially
when
there
is
a
separation
in
near
prospect
stella
s
visit
was
not
to
extend
beyond
the
middle
of
september
while
langdale
s
original
intention
was
to
return
to
england
in
october
and
then
they
saw
so
much
of
each
other
they
had
so
much
to
say
and
looked
grave
and
laughed
and
interested
and
animated
all
in
turn
what
could
such
proceedings
mean
but
that
they
were
fascinated
by
each
other
and
falling
in
love
and
then
in
the
midst
of
her
dubitations
on
the
point
timothy
haydon
suddenly
announced
his
intention
of
visiting
england
after
shearing
it
was
well
known
to
his
friends
that
he
had
a
tribe
of
unmarried
elderly
female
relations
in
of
all
degrees
of
nearness
and
remoteness
he
would
never
return
alive
julia
was
certain
of
that
if
she
was
not
prepared
to
resign
him
to
let
him
become
the
victim
of
a
foreign
brave
of
the
female
sect
she
must
take
speedy
action
but
what
if
after
the
day
on
which
that
stroll
should
come
off
in
the
garden
with
a
successful
issue
she
heard
that
the
knell
of
ted
s
hopes
as
far
as
stella
was
concerned
had
been
rung
it
was
a
cruel
position
for
a
young
woman
whose
fate
lay
in
her
own
hands
as
far
at
any
rate
as
the
second
best
match
possible
to
her
was
concerned
it
was
like
the
story
of
the
old
woman
who
was
driving
her
pigs
to
market
in
her
perplexity
julia
resolved
to
play
the
part
of
the
rope
in
that
legend
of
the
nursery
according
to
the
light
that
was
in
her
she
resolved
on
a
little
experiment
of
her
own
to
bring
matters
to
a
crisis
two
days
before
claude
returned
there
had
been
a
party
at
morrison
s
langdale
was
one
of
the
players
and
during
an
interval
in
which
miss
morton
and
he
were
looking
on
the
lady
took
the
opportunity
of
speaking
of
stella
s
play
as
a
prelude
to
playing
the
part
of
the
rope
miss
courtland
never
strikes
the
ball
except
on
the
run
now
which
do
you
think
is
the
better
way
to
play
a
stroke
langdale
the
way
in
which
you
are
most
successful
i
should
say
answered
langdale
smiling
i
would
like
awfully
to
learn
how
to
put
on
twist
when
i
give
a
service
as
miss
courtland
does
i
wish
she
were
to
settle
here
when
she
marries
but
her
future
home
will
be
a
long
way
yes
said
langdale
but
julia
could
not
detect
any
show
of
surprise
there
was
perhaps
a
slight
slow
alteration
of
colour
and
in
a
little
while
he
added
i
did
not
know
that
miss
stella
was
to
be
oh
it
is
a
very
old
story
she
was
engaged
for
a
short
time
years
ago
to
the
gentleman
and
broke
it
off
and
now
it
is
on
or
as
good
as
on
least
so
her
that
is
to
be
told
me
perhaps
i
should
not
have
spoken
but
an
arch
i
thought
as
you
are
such
good
friends
that
you
well
i
hope
the
happy
man
deserves
his
good
luck
returned
langdale
and
there
the
matter
dropped
in
thinking
over
it
afterwards
a
panic
seized
julia
that
she
might
have
put
a
rachet
in
the
wheels
instead
of
giving
them
a
spin
but
no
she
felt
certain
people
could
not
be
so
intimate
without
talking
over
things
that
concerned
them
if
langdale
was
at
all
affected
he
would
not
rest
till
he
found
out
whether
this
was
true
such
rumours
often
advanced
affairs
in
a
marvellous
way
but
since
then
eight
days
had
come
and
gone
and
there
was
no
sign
miss
morton
used
to
lie
awake
at
night
thinking
that
after
all
she
might
fall
between
two
stools
and
now
shearing
would
soon
begin
and
she
was
as
undecided
as
ever
about
that
stroll
in
the
garden
with
timothy
haydon
so
on
this
sunday
she
resolved
to
glean
all
that
she
could
hoping
for
some
light
that
would
help
her
to
come
to
a
decision
after
dinner
she
and
claude
went
into
the
arbour
at
the
far
end
of
the
garden
the
very
spot
in
which
julia
had
pictured
herself
gently
leading
her
adonis
of
fifty
into
the
primrose
path
of
dalliance
she
recalled
him
as
she
had
seen
him
that
morning
his
pew
was
not
far
from
theirs
in
church
and
her
heart
fell
his
fiery
fringe
of
hair
was
getting
scantier
his
eyes
paler
and
more
blinking
his
wrinkles
more
obtrusive
and
then
she
thought
of
ted
the
contrast
between
the
two
gave
her
a
sense
of
faltering
dismay
then
she
thought
of
stella
as
an
interloper
whose
unpardonable
wilfulness
overshadowed
her
own
julia
s
plans
like
a
nightshade
well
nell
and
how
do
you
get
on
with
stella
courtland
on
the
whole
she
said
suddenly
rousing
herself
out
of
the
reverie
in
which
the
probable
and
possible
husband
formed
a
disconcerting
foreground
oh
charmingly
who
could
help
liking
her
full
of
fun
and
all
kinds
of
unexpected
you
seem
to
have
rather
a
trick
of
standing
round
her
at
lull
when
she
talks
but
for
my
own
part
i
like
a
girl
with
a
more
open
disposition
now
who
would
see
her
with
langdale
without
thinking
they
were
lovers
or
going
to
be
said
julia
with
much
animation
well
and
supposing
they
were
said
claude
a
little
surprised
at
her
sister
s
tone
supposing
they
were
and
she
as
good
as
engaged
to
ted
ritchie
retorted
julia
she
was
determined
to
put
her
case
bluntly
so
as
to
extort
her
sister
s
opinion
all
the
more
quickly
but
instead
of
evoking
any
sharp
denial
as
she
hoped
to
do
a
sudden
light
seemed
to
fall
on
claude
well
now
that
explains
what
has
begun
to
puzzle
me
she
said
slowly
and
at
these
words
poor
julia
s
heart
fell
what
has
been
puzzling
you
nell
the
sort
of
fast
friendship
there
is
between
stella
and
langdale
without
any
approach
to
without
any
approach
to
echoed
julia
bitterly
well
nell
you
must
be
a
greenhorn
to
be
taken
in
by
such
stuff
why
you
can
not
see
the
two
together
without
knowing
at
once
they
are
playing
at
being
friends
but
it
s
about
the
shabbiest
disguise
i
ever
oh
i
know
how
you
look
at
it
julia
said
claude
with
a
quiet
smile
you
only
see
part
of
the
play
and
the
other
part
you
put
together
all
well
i
see
only
part
but
enough
is
as
good
as
a
feast
they
say
why
last
thursday
when
i
was
over
there
i
saw
them
meeting
at
the
bridge
and
it
took
them
a
solid
hour
to
get
from
there
to
the
house
and
yet
till
stella
appeared
you
know
the
sort
of
deadly
calm
the
doctor
always
maintained
to
young
ladies
indeed
waring
felt
certain
there
was
something
behind
it
he
was
privately
married
or
a
or
oh
we
all
know
waring
s
talent
for
working
out
patterns
for
other
people
s
lives
said
claude
with
a
superior
little
smile
which
julia
found
very
trying
you
see
she
went
on
with
the
combined
experience
of
one
recently
married
and
travelled
people
in
the
bush
think
as
a
rule
that
if
two
people
like
stella
and
langdale
have
long
interesting
talks
it
must
somehow
mean
so
it
does
in
cases
but
they
are
the
and
with
them
it
doesn
t
and
when
you
see
a
little
more
of
the
world
you
ll
find
there
are
plenty
more
like
them
why
when
we
were
at
geneva
we
met
an
american
lady
and
her
mother
i
suppose
i
ought
to
name
the
mother
first
but
she
was
really
as
much
in
the
background
as
an
extra
well
the
daughter
was
not
young
and
there
was
a
countryman
of
hers
the
consul
there
who
had
been
her
intimate
friend
for
fourteen
years
during
all
that
time
when
they
are
apart
they
write
long
letters
to
each
other
every
other
good
gracious
what
a
waste
of
time
why
in
the
world
don
t
they
marry
cried
julia
energetically
well
you
see
they
only
want
just
to
be
friends
answered
claude
with
unconscious
irony
and
they
had
all
sorts
of
things
to
talk
about
only
they
were
always
very
serious
but
stella
and
the
doctor
have
great
fun
very
why
do
they
chaff
each
other
much
because
you
know
that
s
a
great
sign
sometimes
that
s
the
way
dan
wylie
and
milly
waring
used
to
go
mercy
on
us
do
you
suppose
that
stella
and
langdale
go
in
for
that
sort
of
said
claude
with
a
comic
look
of
horror
well
i
wish
to
goodness
you
would
give
me
some
idea
of
what
they
go
in
for
i
might
then
get
an
opinion
of
my
own
you
mustn
t
think
it
s
just
idle
curiosity
said
julia
with
a
solemn
expression
any
time
i
overhear
them
they
laugh
and
smile
at
things
that
don
t
seem
to
me
in
the
least
funny
and
hector
too
who
is
the
slowest
coach
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
he
seems
quite
lively
and
talkative
with
these
well
you
know
hector
and
langdale
were
great
friends
before
ever
stella
what
was
that
talk
going
on
about
on
thursday
evening
oh
there
is
a
theory
that
each
is
writing
a
novel
stella
declares
the
doctor
is
bent
on
making
his
book
so
agreeable
that
there
are
crowds
of
obliging
fairies
in
attendance
on
his
characters
picking
crumpled
out
of
their
way
and
so
on
and
he
imagines
that
her
people
in
the
end
resolve
to
sit
still
all
their
lives
as
the
only
way
in
which
they
can
avoid
doing
evil
and
then
when
things
go
wrong
they
call
nature
and
life
and
providence
to
the
bar
of
judgment
and
decree
that
they
ought
to
be
hanged
so
as
to
give
the
world
a
fresh
start
the
doctor
declares
that
reaping
as
we
sow
makes
up
of
the
misfortunes
of
life
then
stella
asserts
that
life
is
so
arranged
that
you
sow
tares
when
you
mean
to
sow
wheat
and
that
when
you
do
sow
honest
grain
an
enemy
comes
in
the
night
who
spoils
the
well
it
s
rather
silly
don
t
you
think
to
go
on
so
about
things
and
then
they
seem
to
turn
even
people
s
misfortunes
into
a
joke
they
were
actually
smiling
over
dene
s
compound
fracture
oh
julia
how
can
you
take
up
things
in
such
a
crooked
way
said
claude
warmly
they
did
nothing
of
the
sort
hector
had
been
to
see
dene
and
said
he
was
getting
through
being
confined
to
the
house
so
long
and
then
stella
said
quite
gravely
at
often
makes
one
believe
she
is
in
earnest
when
she
is
i
suppose
in
writing
a
novel
fit
to
be
read
when
one
smoked
a
pipe
after
the
labours
of
the
day
are
over
an
accident
of
this
kind
should
be
termed
one
of
the
agreeable
amusements
of
old
would
you
ignore
a
compound
fracture
altogether
well
i
am
sure
that
is
chaffing
if
not
more
so
said
julia
sturdily
and
then
what
did
langdale
say
not
if
it
pointed
one
s
pet
moral
so
completely
he
said
you
must
perceive
that
if
an
old
gentleman
at
persists
in
riding
a
fiery
horse
imperfectly
broken
in
he
lays
himself
open
to
accident
in
fact
he
was
so
likely
to
get
his
neck
broken
that
a
compound
fracture
may
be
in
comparison
called
a
gentle
warning
and
then
hector
and
langdale
have
taken
to
calling
stella
st
charity
what
is
that
for
oh
because
she
has
the
most
extraordinary
way
of
finding
out
creatures
that
are
hurt
before
we
came
she
found
a
little
calf
with
a
broken
leg
when
she
was
out
riding
one
of
the
boundary
riders
set
the
leg
for
her
and
she
has
nursed
it
in
a
fashion
it
is
now
nearly
well
then
early
last
week
she
came
upon
an
old
crow
badly
wounded
and
she
brought
that
right
home
and
tied
up
its
broken
wing
and
treated
it
with
vaseline
hector
and
langdale
call
it
satan
but
stella
won
t
have
that
name
she
says
the
only
time
satan
was
hurt
it
only
made
him
cleverer
than
ever
but
it
s
a
dreadfully
cross
old
crow
and
we
all
think
it
is
the
queerest
pet
but
it
really
begins
to
hop
after
oh
she
s
a
spoilt
thing
she
always
does
just
whatever
comes
into
her
head
however
queer
it
may
be
said
julia
impatiently
she
really
seemed
as
far
as
ever
from
any
guiding
light
as
to
that
walk
with
timothy
well
what
comes
into
her
head
in
that
way
is
very
kind
and
sweet
returned
claude
there
is
poor
old
mick
is
that
a
crow
or
a
calf
or
what
said
julia
pettishly
not
nearly
so
most
people
at
any
rate
laughed
claude
he
is
a
dreadful
little
old
ragged
drunken
irishman
who
has
eight
young
children
he
used
to
come
to
lull
sometimes
asking
for
a
job
but
dunstan
and
some
of
the
other
men
thought
so
badly
of
him
louise
dared
not
give
him
any
work
but
one
day
when
he
came
stella
met
him
by
the
creek
and
had
a
long
chat
with
him
and
coaxed
dunstan
to
give
him
work
and
now
he
is
in
constant
employment
in
the
home
field
and
hardly
a
day
passes
but
he
says
something
ridiculously
droll
to
stella
she
declares
that
naturally
he
is
one
of
the
best
little
men
she
ever
what
that
awful
little
mick
doolan
that
has
been
so
often
in
gaol
for
drunkenness
yes
but
stella
has
found
out
it
is
his
wife
who
drives
him
to
the
she
is
a
perfect
virago
and
every
now
and
then
mick
comes
with
a
black
eye
and
a
funny
shade
over
it
he
says
he
was
breaking
wood
and
a
stick
flew
up
and
hit
him
stella
goes
to
see
her
regularly
now
when
she
goes
into
minjah
and
we
fancy
things
are
a
little
better
but
stella
does
not
like
to
talk
of
her
charities
she
says
they
nearly
always
turn
out
addled
i
don
t
wonder
at
it
if
she
takes
up
people
like
mick
wylie
met
her
near
the
cemetery
the
other
day
and
she
watched
her
go
into
it
with
a
basket
of
flowers
what
does
she
do
that
for
she
weeded
rupert
courtland
s
grave
and
puts
flowers
on
it
once
or
twice
a
week
the
cousin
you
know
who
planted
the
home
field
and
lived
there
with
the
courtland
brothers
so
many
years
he
was
so
fond
of
trees
and
flowers
and
planted
so
many
that
are
now
in
full
well
you
may
say
what
you
like
but
i
think
she
is
rather
queer
said
julia
then
do
you
really
think
nell
that
neither
stella
nor
langdale
care
for
each
other
except
as
friends
mind
as
i
said
before
i
have
good
reason
for
wishing
to
but
what
good
reason
can
anyone
else
have
to
know
what
chiefly
concerns
themselves
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
answer
decidedly
for
either
especially
i
don
t
think
i
should
say
for
whom
what
a
close
sort
of
thing
you
are
getting
nell
well
for
langdale
if
you
must
know
when
he
walks
across
in
the
afternoon
if
stella
is
not
in
the
room
or
in
the
veranda
where
we
sit
so
often
and
he
catches
sight
of
her
coming
or
hears
her
voice
his
whole
face
lights
up
you
see
his
is
a
face
that
must
show
what
he
feels
more
than
most
men
s
there
is
no
part
of
it
hidden
the
eyes
and
mouth
sometimes
look
as
tender
as
a
woman
s
and
yet
there
is
something
a
little
hard
about
him
and
suddenly
when
he
is
talking
something
makes
him
look
almost
well
nell
you
always
were
one
to
notice
a
great
deal
and
find
things
out
long
before
other
people
did
said
julia
with
sisterly
admiration
she
herself
seldom
noticed
things
unless
they
had
a
distinctly
personal
bearing
and
then
she
invariably
interpreted
them
according
to
her
own
wishes
it
seems
to
me
you
have
been
taking
langdale
out
of
winding
pretty
completely
she
said
after
a
pause
well
you
see
one
must
do
something
when
one
has
to
keep
so
much
and
do
a
lot
of
sewing
said
claude
with
a
pensive
little
sigh
unconsciously
hitting
upon
one
of
the
keys
to
that
passion
for
psychological
observations
which
with
some
women
develops
into
a
sort
of
sixth
sense
but
for
all
that
you
know
i
shouldn
t
be
a
bit
surprised
if
they
parted
friends
and
nothing
more
certainly
langdale
doesn
t
talk
of
returning
to
england
much
lately
and
stella
too
sometimes
when
she
speaks
of
returning
to
fairacre
suddenly
turns
very
silent
but
that
may
be
because
she
thinks
of
ted
she
is
to
stay
at
laurette
s
on
her
way
back
but
what
do
louise
and
claude
say
as
for
hector
he
s
such
a
he
wouldn
t
see
anything
unless
several
people
told
him
claude
and
louise
we
none
of
us
exchanged
a
syllable
on
the
matter
oh
you
mustn
t
imagine
we
sit
and
talk
things
over
and
try
to
ferret
things
out
we
girls
used
well
i
call
that
a
very
cold
reserved
sort
of
way
for
a
family
said
julia
with
a
touch
of
scorn
and
that
s
one
of
the
things
that
the
tourist
people
who
come
here
for
a
few
weeks
and
write
books
praise
us
for
they
say
we
have
such
an
open
unreserved
easy
way
but
then
you
see
those
tourists
mostly
see
the
people
who
have
made
money
in
business
in
the
towns
and
they
are
nearly
always
garrulous
everywhere
it
s
their
life
said
claude
with
a
touch
of
her
husband
s
manner
that
was
not
lost
upon
julia
yes
and
no
doubt
the
courtlands
are
extra
reserved
because
of
their
ancestry
she
said
tossing
her
head
it
s
good
of
you
to
keep
so
friendly
with
us
nell
after
marrying
into
such
a
don
t
be
so
absurd
julia
and
whatever
you
do
don
t
mention
a
word
of
what
i
ve
said
to
what
have
you
said
then
cried
julia
in
high
dudgeon
i
could
imagine
ten
times
as
much
in
half
a
minute
i
believe
you
know
more
than
you
say
i
think
stella
courtland
is
a
perfect
flirt
and
you
don
t
like
tell
on
her
but
after
all
i
don
t
believe
she
ll
ever
give
up
a
man
with
fifteen
thousand
a
year
for
one
that
has
to
look
at
people
s
tongues
for
a
claude
could
not
refrain
from
laughter
at
this
incisive
dr
langdale
needn
t
if
he
does
not
like
you
know
he
has
seven
hundred
a
year
private
yes
his
father
was
in
business
at
any
london
i
don
t
think
that
was
so
very
aristocratic
said
julia
who
really
was
in
the
mood
in
which
certain
women
love
to
fling
their
tongue
abroad
like
a
javelin
yes
his
father
was
a
london
and
the
grandson
of
a
baronet
answered
claude
calmly
oh
morrison
only
mentioned
it
in
the
course
of
conversation
just
when
i
told
her
that
my
pretty
bonnet
was
bought
in
london
in
a
shop
kept
by
a
lord
s
well
if
stella
didn
t
feel
it
was
wrong
to
make
such
fast
friends
with
one
man
when
she
s
engaged
to
another
surely
she
would
have
said
something
to
you
or
louise
about
ted
said
julia
making
a
last
despairing
effort
to
fossick
out
some
more
highly
coloured
hint
than
she
had
yet
obtained
oh
as
to
that
stella
got
so
much
blamed
on
all
sides
for
getting
engaged
to
ted
for
a
week
and
then
breaking
it
off
we
none
of
us
expect
to
hear
of
her
being
engaged
till
she
s
on
the
eve
of
marrying
you
know
it
was
after
that
affair
she
came
to
see
louise
over
three
years
ago
and
she
said
then
she
never
would
be
engaged
for
more
than
a
few
days
the
temptation
of
throwing
it
all
up
again
might
be
too
oh
she
s
a
conceited
thing
i
always
think
there
s
something
almost
impertinent
in
the
cool
way
she
treats
everything
said
julia
viciously
look
here
julia
if
you
don
t
like
stella
we
ll
stop
talking
about
her
said
claude
and
with
that
she
returned
to
the
house
julia
lingered
for
a
few
moments
in
the
arbour
trying
to
decide
whether
it
would
not
be
safer
to
have
haydon
to
dinner
next
sunday
and
renounce
all
chance
of
ted
for
good
and
that
stella
is
too
risky
a
creature
to
let
anything
hang
on
her
ways
she
thought
and
she
slowly
followed
claude
into
the
house
oh
my
dears
her
mother
was
saying
did
you
hear
that
sally
richardson
died
on
saturday
night
at
twenty
minutes
past
twelve
she
ate
a
little
sago
with
a
tablespoonful
of
port
wine
in
it
only
half
an
hour
before
and
she
said
the
whole
of
gentle
jesus
meek
and
mild
a
little
afterwards
her
poor
dear
and
morton
wiped
her
eyes
well
mamma
you
know
what
a
fearfully
tiresome
creature
sally
always
was
said
julia
tartly
sally
had
been
a
housemaid
in
the
morton
family
for
some
time
but
indeed
it
needed
not
this
tie
in
the
past
to
make
morton
dwell
with
effusion
on
every
small
particular
she
could
glean
of
a
death
or
on
the
blank
that
it
caused
it
is
sometimes
curious
to
observe
the
modifications
which
parental
traits
undergo
in
a
second
generation
julia
had
inherited
all
her
mother
s
ardour
for
the
details
of
other
people
s
lives
but
utterly
divested
of
her
mother
s
quick
sympathy
there
was
really
no
personal
gratification
which
morton
would
have
purchased
during
any
period
of
her
life
had
it
been
in
her
power
at
the
cost
of
a
to
a
mandarin
in
china
whereas
there
was
no
kind
of
ache
julia
would
have
saved
any
young
woman
she
knew
if
such
pain
could
advance
her
own
scheme
of
life
perhaps
when
the
laws
of
heredity
are
better
understood
the
danger
of
saddling
a
daughter
with
callous
indifference
to
the
claims
of
others
will
serve
to
curb
the
too
expansive
altruism
of
mothers
like
morton
the
idea
of
mamma
going
to
sit
up
with
that
richardson
woman
all
friday
night
said
julia
in
a
discontented
voice
well
my
dear
you
ought
to
be
used
to
your
mother
being
a
real
christian
by
this
time
said
her
father
not
without
intentional
sarcasm
he
was
a
hale
old
man
of
who
enjoyed
the
distinction
of
being
the
only
squatter
in
the
warracootie
district
who
had
lived
fifty
years
of
his
life
in
australia
he
was
one
of
three
of
an
old
english
squire
who
had
lost
his
had
come
to
victoria
with
a
little
capital
which
had
all
been
lost
in
unprofitable
speculations
so
that
they
were
for
some
time
hands
till
a
fortunate
gold
claim
formed
the
foundation
of
the
wealth
which
they
now
enjoyed
xxx
there
are
many
days
of
an
australian
spring
on
which
to
remain
within
doors
is
an
impossible
heresy
this
sunday
was
one
of
them
the
two
who
afforded
miss
julia
morton
so
irritating
a
theme
for
conjecture
and
comment
were
wandering
in
the
home
field
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
lullaboolagana
household
langdale
had
a
little
book
in
his
hand
and
was
engaged
in
the
congenial
task
of
supporting
a
theory
stella
had
started
some
days
previously
she
had
found
virgil
s
eclogues
full
of
notes
in
her
deceased
kinsman
s
handwriting
and
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
that
the
home
field
was
full
of
hints
from
those
stately
pastoral
poems
suppose
we
trace
the
resemblances
one
day
said
langdale
may
i
say
it
asked
stella
smiling
you
will
say
it
whether
you
may
or
not
when
you
look
so
mischievous
well
don
t
you
think
it
is
the
german
in
you
who
suggests
that
heartless
form
of
crushing
my
poor
little
fancy
now
as
a
penalty
for
that
speech
i
shall
pelt
you
with
proofs
said
langdale
laughing
and
now
he
was
going
to
make
good
the
threat
armed
with
the
little
book
in
tarnished
gold
that
bore
traces
of
having
been
a
treasured
companion
i
am
waiting
to
be
pelted
said
stella
well
there
is
amaryllis
to
begin
with
swift
as
a
fawn
lithe
as
a
young
pine
flitting
by
pretending
she
does
not
hear
the
lay
that
tityrus
pipes
on
his
but
where
is
she
oh
a
commentator
is
always
allowed
to
see
a
little
more
than
his
readers
or
hearers
i
see
her
and
then
there
is
the
spreading
beech
under
which
the
swain
reclines
look
there
are
three
beeches
hard
spreading
as
far
as
their
age
permits
could
the
under
which
tityrus
reclines
do
more
oh
i
see
that
in
the
matter
of
proving
a
theory
you
were
born
to
destroy
afreets
said
stella
her
face
sparkling
with
fun
at
the
extreme
gravity
which
her
companion
had
assumed
but
there
is
much
more
to
follow
a
little
further
on
melib
oe
us
may
one
read
a
little
latin
to
you
without
scandal
surely
that
is
an
anachronism
what
else
would
he
read
said
stella
pretending
to
misunderstand
they
both
laughed
at
this
and
then
stella
said
yes
one
then
hic
inter
densas
corylos
the
oolloolloo
is
haunted
with
dense
tityrus
in
his
reply
says
that
rome
lifts
up
her
head
among
other
cities
as
high
as
cypress
among
bending
osiers
i
am
not
sure
about
more
than
one
patch
of
osiers
but
cypresses
you
have
in
yes
and
of
all
the
trees
that
grow
none
look
lovelier
in
the
rose
twilight
of
sunset
see
those
clumps
of
them
between
the
house
and
the
orchard
mingled
with
at
the
cypress
looks
dark
and
stern
compared
with
the
silky
tamarisk
locks
but
when
the
sunlight
is
dying
the
cypress
seems
to
disentangle
its
feathery
foliage
till
it
looks
like
an
airy
vision
of
a
tree
rather
than
one
that
has
roots
when
stella
spoke
of
trees
or
animals
or
flowers
one
could
see
that
they
were
like
living
humanized
creatures
to
her
now
i
have
often
wondered
why
i
like
better
at
sunset
tell
me
some
more
about
oh
you
haven
t
finished
your
proofs
well
melib
oe
us
speaks
further
of
fountains
and
vineyards
pines
you
have
in
hundreds
you
have
two
fountains
and
over
an
acre
of
really
the
resemblance
becomes
quite
startling
laughed
stella
yes
and
then
there
is
mention
of
on
which
the
bees
feast
then
you
have
flocks
of
pigeons
and
elms
and
without
number
in
view
of
this
you
must
perceive
that
the
lines
concerning
the
hoarse
note
of
the
the
s
complaint
and
the
towering
elm
either
as
a
prophecy
regarding
lull
or
second
that
the
place
has
been
moulded
upon
these
lines
i
incline
to
the
view
the
emphasis
is
my
but
seriously
it
is
an
interesting
coincidence
that
all
the
natural
objects
named
in
the
eclogues
seem
to
abound
in
the
home
as
you
are
convinced
even
beforehand
my
labours
are
at
an
end
said
langdale
closing
the
book
now
tell
me
have
you
any
funny
little
stories
of
mick
or
dunstan
oh
mick
was
better
than
a
comedy
yesterday
he
hardly
opened
his
mouth
without
making
a
bull
he
told
me
about
one
of
his
girls
who
is
at
service
and
very
much
overworked
the
mistress
it
seems
gives
but
she
s
no
great
hand
at
the
music
said
mick
lowering
his
voice
mysteriously
indade
miss
stella
they
say
she
niver
saw
a
pianny
till
she
came
to
minjah
four
years
ago
and
thin
twas
an
harmonium
well
done
mick
said
langdale
laughing
then
i
asked
after
the
eldest
boy
who
has
got
a
situation
lately
in
a
little
store
he
doesn
t
get
on
with
the
one
can
last
week
he
went
to
board
at
an
aunt
s
poor
mick
was
much
scandalized
why
patrick
says
i
to
him
what
do
people
s
children
do
who
have
no
parents
but
lodge
wid
their
father
s
sister
and
thin
the
house
is
near
the
swampy
end
of
the
town
and
people
die
there
that
niver
died
anywhere
well
you
may
laugh
but
there
is
sound
sense
under
it
all
i
shall
miss
mick
s
little
anecdotes
sadly
when
i
go
when
you
go
repeated
langdale
and
his
face
fell
visibly
on
meeting
his
eyes
a
deeper
tinge
stole
into
the
girl
s
cheeks
then
he
added
in
a
lighter
tone
there
are
days
in
august
when
people
who
speak
of
going
away
should
be
fined
or
at
any
rate
set
to
counting
the
and
gadding
and
yet
how
very
human
it
is
to
go
away
even
as
human
as
it
is
to
come
you
see
i
am
catching
a
little
of
your
reasonableness
said
stella
that
may
be
but
on
a
day
like
this
when
the
veriest
little
locust
chirps
in
the
sun
as
though
he
never
should
be
old
i
maintain
it
is
little
short
of
felony
to
speak
of
the
accidents
that
mar
life
you
see
i
am
catching
a
little
of
your
unreason
he
added
they
had
crossed
the
stone
bridge
and
stood
on
a
hillock
clothed
with
elms
and
scrub
cypresses
where
the
breath
of
hidden
violets
came
and
went
on
the
air
like
tremulous
music
from
this
slight
eminence
they
had
a
view
of
the
country
messmate
ranges
with
their
dim
gullies
the
wicked
wood
spectral
in
its
bareness
the
break
in
the
far
distance
where
one
became
sensible
of
the
peeloo
plain
the
flat
country
and
the
contour
of
ridgy
hills
that
stretched
beyond
minjah
millowie
on
every
side
lay
the
still
wide
woods
motionless
as
a
great
picture
framed
between
heaven
and
earth
all
clothed
with
the
overflowing
sunshine
as
with
a
garment
and
yet
these
two
as
they
stood
there
and
looked
afar
and
listened
to
the
songs
of
birds
and
all
the
woodland
sounds
which
filled
the
influence
was
it
that
stirred
both
so
deeply
in
the
midst
of
this
peaceful
idyllic
scene
who
can
tell
what
vague
outward
gropings
of
the
spirit
make
the
heart
turn
on
itself
in
some
rare
hour
as
with
a
quickened
sense
of
the
sweet
calm
of
the
present
a
shrinking
fear
of
the
uncertain
days
to
come
which
may
be
clouded
with
futile
agony
drenched
with
the
of
life
s
keenest
sorrows
for
some
moments
neither
spoke
you
will
never
know
how
good
it
is
of
me
not
to
talk
like
your
friend
ivan
michalowicz
just
now
said
stella
breaking
the
silence
i
could
believe
the
air
is
full
of
unseen
that
is
a
plagiarism
from
mick
go
unheard
wails
langdale
said
laughing
yes
and
souls
that
can
find
no
home
but
i
well
i
must
admit
that
on
a
perfect
day
like
the
only
fault
it
has
is
that
it
keeps
time
to
a
kind
of
sadness
creeps
over
me
it
is
the
penalty
for
looking
before
and
yes
neither
a
cat
nor
a
marigold
uses
the
sunlight
as
an
invocation
to
call
ghosts
into
a
ghosts
you
know
nothing
of
them
at
this
very
moment
the
air
is
drenched
with
ghosts
ghosts
of
days
to
and
gray
when
youth
is
left
far
those
that
look
out
at
the
window
are
darkened
and
the
daughters
of
music
are
laid
it
is
good
of
you
not
to
speak
like
ivan
said
langdale
gravely
he
said
once
that
the
great
melancholy
steppes
of
his
native
land
had
got
into
his
disposition
i
think
the
vast
solitudes
of
your
australia
have
got
into
but
do
you
never
think
how
dreadful
it
is
to
grow
old
and
it
goes
on
all
the
time
why
since
we
have
been
here
if
your
eyes
were
keen
enough
you
would
see
wrinkles
deepening
on
my
thank
heaven
my
eyes
are
not
so
precocious
ah
now
you
have
betrayed
yourself
you
are
not
so
hopelessly
reasonable
after
all
i
may
yet
hear
you
rail
at
life
in
good
set
but
don
t
you
think
it
is
time
enough
to
speak
of
wrinkles
when
they
come
ah
but
they
have
come
i
discovered
a
little
sly
wretch
of
a
crow
at
the
corner
of
my
eye
the
other
day
look
there
when
i
stand
sideways
in
the
light
and
stella
stood
so
that
her
crow
might
be
more
clearly
seen
langdale
could
not
resist
laughing
my
eyesight
is
not
sharp
enough
or
else
your
crow
does
not
exist
he
said
spoken
like
a
courtier
but
it
would
be
more
friendly
to
see
it
and
then
to
say
something
out
of
seneca
to
comfort
me
when
will
your
profession
make
some
real
advance
and
invent
an
elixir
for
renewing
perhaps
you
are
thinking
more
of
the
happy
despatch
of
superfluous
beings
but
as
it
is
you
are
chiefly
concerned
with
screening
fools
from
their
and
thwarting
the
beneficent
severity
of
nature
yes
it
is
painfully
humdrum
have
you
ever
thought
what
calling
in
life
might
put
one
in
the
way
of
doing
least
mischief
well
good
dressmaking
for
my
own
sex
do
you
remember
what
frenchman
said
that
women
take
the
outward
polish
of
civilization
more
quickly
than
men
but
that
inwardly
they
remain
more
truly
savage
ah
that
is
the
sort
of
paradox
which
even
a
frenchman
can
not
resist
it
is
so
glaringly
must
be
something
in
it
is
wrapped
up
in
a
neat
little
epigram
but
about
the
dressmaking
well
i
think
a
woman
who
makes
dresses
that
fit
perfectly
adds
more
to
the
practical
christianity
of
the
world
than
most
people
are
aware
of
if
you
could
peep
into
the
mind
of
a
woman
when
a
costly
dress
comes
home
that
makes
her
waist
what
it
shouldn
t
be
you
would
believe
the
frenchman
a
little
more
she
may
have
sat
at
the
feet
of
sages
and
be
in
touch
with
much
of
the
wisest
and
the
best
but
in
that
moment
she
has
taken
a
great
leap
back
to
the
anthropoidal
but
when
her
waist
is
i
am
when
the
dressmaker
has
done
her
work
nobly
why
then
a
sort
of
flow
of
philanthropy
suffuses
one
s
whole
being
yes
to
make
a
dress
a
pinch
or
a
wrinkle
in
is
one
of
the
least
mischievous
things
a
woman
can
do
as
for
your
well
what
do
you
say
to
a
who
does
not
cripple
the
foot
and
makes
good
shoes
with
honest
workmanship
with
such
shoes
one
feels
impelled
to
walk
more
and
to
walk
more
is
to
be
in
the
open
air
and
to
be
in
the
open
air
is
to
i
say
happy
oh
why
not
on
the
whole
stick
close
to
words
where
is
that
on
the
whole
stick
close
to
words
then
shall
you
go
through
the
sure
portal
into
the
temple
of
certainty
that
is
mephistopheles
speaking
to
the
student
don
t
you
think
it
is
time
you
spoke
german
to
me
yes
i
have
two
anecdotes
to
tell
you
in
german
but
for
the
summit
of
in
the
open
air
don
t
you
think
we
are
more
indebted
to
the
horse
than
the
shoemaker
you
see
where
the
messmate
ranges
fall
off
into
flat
country
that
is
the
beginning
of
one
of
our
unoccupied
spaces
and
the
perhaps
you
know
it
no
i
don
t
think
i
claude
and
i
rode
there
the
other
morning
early
i
had
duke
a
delightful
horse
who
skims
the
ground
like
a
how
far
did
you
go
then
thirteen
miles
we
reached
no
man
s
land
which
stretches
away
close
up
to
the
new
south
wales
boundary
nothing
but
sand
and
slender
stringy
bark
trees
that
grow
so
thick
the
sun
can
hardly
pass
between
them
it
was
a
most
glorious
ride
in
the
keen
morning
air
loaded
with
the
fragrance
of
i
wonder
if
you
would
let
me
come
with
you
some
morning
oh
we
shall
be
delighted
but
then
it
is
in
the
mornings
you
write
your
novel
tell
me
how
are
your
people
going
on
do
the
wrong
ones
still
make
love
to
each
other
stella
went
on
to
sketch
imaginary
plots
ending
in
the
most
fabulous
forms
of
happiness
and
and
introducing
such
extraordinary
dialogues
that
by
the
time
the
sound
of
a
gong
summoned
them
to
afternoon
tea
on
the
western
veranda
the
two
were
laughing
continuously
like
a
pair
of
xxxi
two
days
later
stella
had
again
ridden
in
the
direction
of
no
man
s
land
but
this
time
she
was
alone
except
for
dustiefoot
and
her
horse
and
she
had
an
shearing
was
soon
to
begin
and
all
hands
were
busily
occupied
on
the
station
under
these
circumstances
stella
insisted
on
her
birthright
as
an
australian
born
to
ride
through
her
native
woods
without
any
companionship
beyond
a
swift
horse
and
her
beloved
dog
there
was
some
talk
of
getting
maisie
to
practise
riding
on
a
not
very
young
pony
whose
wildest
pace
had
long
been
a
gentle
canter
so
that
during
the
time
there
was
a
premium
on
all
male
workers
she
might
accompany
her
mistress
but
stella
rejected
the
proposal
with
comic
horror
maisie
by
herself
or
andy
by
himself
might
be
borne
but
the
united
caution
of
the
two
would
mar
the
most
delectable
ride
that
could
be
offered
by
spring
and
duke
if
they
really
objected
to
her
riding
look
at
the
hypocritical
baby
pretending
to
give
in
cried
claude
as
if
she
ever
failed
to
get
her
own
way
in
anything
i
wish
i
could
go
said
claude
making
a
rueful
little
face
but
her
husband
did
not
echo
the
wish
i
shall
ask
langdale
to
come
with
me
thought
stella
but
somehow
she
did
not
which
could
hardly
be
deemed
the
action
of
unbiased
friendship
it
was
her
second
ride
alone
one
breezy
sunshiny
forenoon
when
four
miles
from
the
on
the
road
that
led
to
no
man
s
land
stella
came
upon
the
strangest
spectacle
she
had
ever
seen
it
was
a
very
waggon
with
a
drawn
by
two
horses
followed
by
another
tied
to
the
vehicle
behind
and
all
three
lean
to
the
last
degree
of
emaciation
while
the
pace
at
which
they
went
was
that
of
animals
worn
out
with
famine
and
fatigue
and
everything
else
was
in
keeping
with
the
worn
famished
look
of
the
horses
at
each
slow
revolution
of
the
wheels
the
waggon
creaked
and
groaned
as
though
it
would
fall
to
pieces
the
woodwork
was
warped
and
splintered
with
here
and
there
dim
greenish
reminiscences
of
having
at
some
remote
period
been
painted
the
canvas
cover
was
draggled
and
patched
saturated
with
reddish
sand
and
dust
frayed
into
tatters
at
one
side
and
flapping
dismally
in
the
wind
the
harness
was
entirely
composed
of
untanned
lengths
of
kangaroo
skin
the
horses
had
no
bits
in
their
mouths
but
there
was
a
ragged
remnant
of
a
bridle
on
each
to
which
knotted
ropes
were
attached
that
hung
loosely
on
the
poor
lean
necks
every
rib
might
be
counted
at
a
distance
they
crawled
on
with
drooping
heads
the
sound
of
their
worn
unshod
hoofs
completely
drowned
by
the
perpetual
rumbling
and
groaning
of
the
disjointed
waggon
no
hand
guided
them
no
voice
urged
them
on
it
was
all
so
unspeakably
forlorn
and
dreary
that
the
sight
filled
stella
with
dismay
dustiefoot
who
was
trotting
on
gaily
in
front
paused
as
he
drew
near
this
battered
vehicle
drawn
by
horses
that
looked
only
fit
to
be
the
food
of
carrion
crows
and
he
too
was
plainly
smitten
with
something
akin
to
fear
whether
this
was
occasioned
by
the
strange
rumbling
and
groaning
or
the
weird
appearance
of
the
whole
it
would
be
hard
to
say
but
he
suddenly
stopped
short
and
with
the
hair
round
his
neck
bristling
angrily
began
to
bark
in
a
loud
defiant
way
quiet
good
dog
quiet
said
stella
coaxingly
she
had
reined
in
her
horse
and
it
suddenly
flashed
across
her
mind
that
this
extreme
misery
must
be
rooted
in
some
catastrophe
at
the
sound
of
the
dog
s
barking
the
horses
came
to
a
standstill
it
seemed
as
though
they
were
glad
of
an
excuse
to
give
up
even
the
snail
s
pace
at
which
they
crawled
still
no
sign
of
life
in
the
waggon
women
of
natures
who
have
been
protected
from
every
form
of
harm
all
their
lives
are
usually
not
lacking
in
courage
stella
was
certainly
no
coward
but
she
had
a
powerful
imagination
of
an
essentially
kind
was
there
anyone
in
this
conveyance
alive
was
its
occupant
worn
with
fatigue
and
asleep
she
had
heard
strange
stories
of
people
who
had
been
overtaken
by
drought
or
illness
and
had
been
imprisoned
sometimes
for
months
sometimes
for
a
year
in
a
corner
beside
a
permanent
unvisited
by
any
human
being
she
advanced
slowly
to
the
side
of
the
waggon
and
using
the
bush
salutation
she
said
in
a
loud
clear
voice
but
there
was
no
reply
her
own
words
came
back
to
her
with
mocking
emphasis
she
shrank
from
dismounting
to
look
into
the
waggon
shrank
still
more
from
the
sight
that
might
meet
her
there
should
she
return
home
and
get
hector
or
claude
or
one
of
the
to
come
to
the
rescue
whether
there
was
a
human
being
in
distress
or
beyond
it
the
famished
horses
needed
help
sorely
to
stella
an
animal
in
want
or
pain
was
very
little
if
at
all
less
important
than
a
human
being
the
sight
of
these
three
poor
creatures
with
their
bones
almost
projecting
through
the
skin
with
drooping
heads
and
dim
eyes
standing
in
their
patient
dumbness
went
straight
to
her
heart
no
she
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
leaving
them
she
would
start
them
on
and
take
them
home
where
they
would
be
fed
and
rested
and
if
there
was
anyone
in
oh
i
must
not
be
such
a
coward
she
said
to
herself
impatiently
and
then
with
a
heart
she
rode
close
to
the
side
of
the
waggon
on
which
the
cover
was
tattered
and
fluttering
in
the
soft
spring
wind
that
blew
from
the
west
she
reined
in
duke
the
proud
graceful
young
horse
she
rode
who
had
come
off
victor
in
many
local
races
and
who
was
gentle
and
tractable
as
only
a
horse
can
be
when
ridden
by
an
affectionate
rider
she
bent
down
and
looked
in
the
first
thing
she
saw
was
a
woman
s
long
fair
and
matted
the
next
was
a
dingy
white
cockatoo
that
had
been
fast
asleep
and
now
woke
up
and
began
to
mumble
confound
your
eyes
confound
your
eyes
in
a
faint
rapid
way
that
was
infinitely
eerie
the
woman
s
face
was
partly
hidden
by
one
hand
which
covered
her
eyes
and
the
upper
part
of
her
brown
sunburnt
grimy
hand
very
lean
and
unwashed
and
no
she
was
not
dead
as
stella
at
first
feared
she
moved
and
moaned
and
as
the
bird
went
on
mumbling
descending
to
a
still
lower
depth
of
imprecation
the
sound
and
then
stella
s
sympathetic
voice
saying
i
am
afraid
you
are
very
ill
seemed
partly
to
rouse
her
she
half
sat
up
but
her
eyes
remained
glazed
and
unresponsive
gee
up
jerry
jill
jill
her
tones
were
shrill
though
quavering
and
at
the
words
the
horses
pulled
and
strained
and
once
more
resumed
their
weary
incredibly
slow
walk
they
kept
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
stella
could
but
try
to
make
duke
fall
into
the
same
pace
but
this
was
impossible
he
could
stand
stock
still
or
he
could
walk
his
slowest
but
being
neither
lame
on
four
legs
nor
starved
nor
born
to
drudgery
he
could
not
absolutely
crawl
it
took
this
strange
little
procession
the
best
part
of
two
hours
to
get
within
sight
of
lullaboolagana
no
words
can
express
the
air
of
mingled
pride
and
responsibility
with
which
dustiefoot
marshalled
them
all
he
made
circles
round
them
he
trotted
on
in
front
he
walked
behind
he
panted
his
scarlet
young
tongue
hung
out
with
joy
and
anxiety
his
handsome
bushy
tail
was
arched
upwards
more
airily
than
ever
he
had
the
same
insuperable
difficulty
that
beset
duke
of
being
unable
to
regulate
his
pace
by
that
of
animals
so
famished
so
overborne
and
jaded
that
even
their
hides
would
have
been
worthless
as
stella
examined
them
more
closely
she
saw
that
they
had
sores
all
over
the
jagged
collars
that
were
held
together
with
strands
of
rope
on
their
shoulders
sides
and
thighs
so
utterly
maimed
and
defeated
did
they
look
as
they
dragged
one
quivering
shrunken
leg
after
another
the
only
wonder
was
that
they
had
not
long
since
lain
down
to
die
when
dustiefoot
found
himself
getting
too
far
if
a
young
dog
walked
at
all
that
was
turned
round
and
waited
gazing
at
his
mistress
and
then
at
the
horses
and
their
load
till
he
was
forced
to
give
expression
to
his
feelings
in
one
or
two
barks
which
might
be
classified
as
of
the
order
those
who
have
the
privilege
of
being
intimate
with
dogs
are
aware
that
no
living
creature
is
so
pleased
all
over
at
an
unusual
event
as
a
collie
in
the
second
year
of
his
age
before
the
strange
little
cavalcade
had
reached
the
house
it
was
seen
and
met
first
by
some
of
the
children
then
the
maids
and
finally
by
courtland
and
claude
dunstan
was
at
once
despatched
for
morrison
but
before
he
came
the
poor
woman
was
refreshed
with
wine
washed
arrayed
in
fine
linen
and
comfortably
in
bed
it
was
a
case
of
collapse
through
long
privation
and
exposure
there
was
nothing
to
eat
or
drink
in
the
waggon
beyond
the
stony
remains
of
a
damper
and
a
little
muddy
water
in
a
brown
earthen
jar
she
partly
recovered
consciousness
after
she
had
been
in
bed
for
a
couple
of
hours
morrison
on
seeing
her
came
to
the
conclusion
that
careful
nursing
and
dieting
would
bring
her
round
in
a
few
days
there
was
some
dispute
as
to
who
should
be
chief
nurse
but
finally
stella
convinced
her
that
as
she
had
discovered
the
patient
she
must
be
primarily
held
responsible
you
have
a
name
for
finding
many
ailing
sorts
of
creatures
miss
stella
but
i
think
this
is
the
biggest
cargo
of
any
said
the
doctor
with
an
amused
twinkle
in
his
eyes
and
then
he
gave
his
instructions
with
due
emphasis
i
shall
be
away
and
perhaps
the
next
day
but
langdale
will
look
after
her
how
is
your
last
patient
the
crow
langdale
had
grave
fears
as
to
his
recovery
at
one
soon
after
the
doctor
left
the
patient
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
and
leaving
maisie
in
charge
of
the
stella
went
to
see
after
the
horses
she
found
dunstan
giving
them
small
measures
of
bran
and
oats
and
looking
at
them
with
a
mingled
pity
amazement
and
scorn
that
was
irresistibly
funny
you
have
unharnessed
them
dunstan
that
is
right
oh
you
poor
poor
dear
things
stella
stroked
each
in
turn
unharnessed
them
miss
stelly
well
yes
if
you
calls
them
bits
o
broken
rope
and
rawr
hide
harness
i
m
jiggered
but
it
s
the
very
rummiest
ever
i
seed
and
what
can
have
come
to
her
husband
oh
she
may
not
have
one
but
dunstan
shook
his
head
ah
miss
stelly
you
don
t
never
find
a
female
get
into
such
a
hole
without
she
s
a
married
oman
that
s
the
way
along
o
some
women
if
they
want
to
enjy
themselves
at
all
and
are
they
gets
married
and
then
mostly
they
has
a
very
bad
time
they
re
like
these
yaller
little
birds
you
sticks
em
in
a
cage
and
they
buzz
agin
the
wires
and
yet
if
you
let
them
go
out
into
the
wilds
they
get
knocked
about
and
can
t
get
proper
dunstan
spoke
in
a
leisurely
voice
which
had
a
very
odd
effect
he
was
given
to
moralizing
and
had
those
quaint
reaches
of
fancy
that
are
often
found
with
men
whose
lives
are
passed
in
gardening
or
shepherding
or
other
undrudging
avocations
stella
with
difficulty
refrained
from
laughter
at
this
of
the
disabilities
of
her
sex
i
don
t
think
you
would
like
to
be
a
woman
dunstan
well
no
miss
stelly
if
so
be
that
such
a
thing
could
happen
and
god
a
mighty
give
me
the
pick
to
be
a
female
or
a
worm
i
d
say
a
worm
if
you
please
meaning
no
disrespect
to
the
a
mighty
or
to
you
miss
stelly
a
worm
to
be
sure
has
a
lowly
life
and
unless
it
s
cut
in
two
or
swallered
alive
not
much
happens
in
the
span
of
its
days
but
what
s
that
to
having
things
allays
happening
and
each
one
worse
than
t
other
i
ought
to
know
i
m
married
to
my
third
wife
and
not
one
of
the
three
ever
had
six
months
proper
health
on
dunstan
was
portioning
out
further
doles
of
oats
and
giving
them
to
the
horses
as
he
spoke
so
that
stella
could
enjoy
these
reflections
without
checking
the
flow
of
his
thoughts
dunstan
himself
seldom
laughed
and
when
others
did
so
at
his
sayings
it
disconcerted
and
in
the
end
silenced
him
i
b
lieve
they
have
had
enough
but
the
poor
old
karkisses
look
so
starved
he
said
as
the
horses
set
to
once
more
and
they
are
so
galled
dunstan
don
t
you
think
if
i
bathed
their
sores
with
a
little
warm
yes
i
am
sure
of
stella
hastened
away
and
soon
returned
with
a
china
bowl
of
tepid
water
and
a
soft
sponge
with
which
she
deftly
bathed
one
sore
after
another
they
seem
to
enjoy
it
just
as
if
they
was
christians
said
dunstan
and
then
he
went
to
the
kitchen
and
brought
out
a
pailful
of
warm
water
as
that
in
the
basin
soon
got
discoloured
with
the
dust
and
sand
then
he
stood
by
as
stella
went
from
one
poor
skinny
creature
to
another
caressing
and
speaking
to
them
in
a
low
fond
voice
both
were
so
much
absorbed
that
they
did
not
notice
the
approach
of
hector
courtland
and
langdale
who
stood
at
a
little
distance
looking
on
at
the
scene
with
faces
full
of
an
amused
interest
and
some
deeper
feeling
withal
as
they
watched
the
girl
s
tender
ministration
on
the
poor
galled
scarecrow
horses
why
here
s
langdale
with
the
master
said
dunstan
suddenly
perceiving
them
it
must
be
serious
for
the
poor
female
if
she
must
have
two
though
langdale
was
so
frequent
a
visitor
dunstan
somehow
connected
his
appearance
at
that
juncture
with
the
event
of
the
day
well
stella
this
little
performance
of
yours
caps
all
your
previous
finds
said
hector
looking
at
the
three
horses
with
beaming
eyes
st
charity
i
would
give
much
to
have
your
picture
painted
as
you
stood
here
bathing
the
sores
of
these
horses
said
langdale
and
as
she
returned
his
greeting
there
was
an
expression
in
his
face
which
made
her
look
quickly
away
and
this
is
only
part
of
the
caravan
sir
said
dunstan
addressing
his
master
besides
these
horses
that
the
crows
would
hardly
get
a
mouthful
on
there
s
the
waggon
fit
only
for
firewood
a
cockatoo
that
would
set
your
hair
on
end
with
blasphemy
and
a
onfortinate
female
as
can
t
say
a
word
good
or
we
can
not
permit
you
to
keep
the
cockatoo
charity
said
langdale
i
understand
he
is
worse
than
any
of
the
orthodoxies
consigning
people
to
eternal
and
entire
perdition
irrespective
of
their
well
he
does
swear
very
badly
said
stella
smiling
we
fed
him
and
put
him
in
exile
he
is
on
a
perch
in
the
but
who
ever
heard
of
a
backslider
being
reformed
in
a
stable
look
here
courtland
can
not
you
suggest
a
better
asylum
for
a
foundling
whose
moral
nature
has
been
perverted
his
native
woods
i
should
think
unless
you
take
him
in
hand
yourself
langdale
as
well
as
the
onfortinate
female
as
dunstan
calls
are
you
going
to
look
after
my
patient
langdale
asked
stella
who
stood
sponging
the
roan
horse
s
neck
for
the
second
time
gratis
for
nothing
unless
you
are
a
refractory
nurse
in
which
case
i
shall
charge
you
a
guinea
a
visit
now
if
you
let
me
put
a
little
vaseline
on
these
sore
places
your
new
pets
will
recover
all
the
stella
went
immediately
to
beg
a
pot
of
vaseline
from
louise
there
must
be
a
story
behind
this
curious
little
adventure
said
langdale
examining
the
waggon
and
then
courtland
recalled
some
curious
stories
that
had
come
to
his
knowledge
in
past
years
of
people
who
had
attempted
to
make
long
journeys
with
horses
or
teams
of
bullocks
through
unknown
country
and
came
to
signal
grief
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
heard
of
a
woman
and
a
blaspheming
cockatoo
journeying
through
the
bush
evidently
for
there
are
probably
few
who
have
passed
their
first
youth
without
indulging
now
and
then
in
conjectures
as
to
how
many
would
really
befriend
them
if
they
were
completely
stranded
in
without
money
or
position
and
under
the
shadow
of
some
imputed
crime
we
begin
the
world
as
a
rule
with
pathetic
confidence
in
ourselves
and
others
heaven
is
full
of
beneficence
earth
crowded
with
friends
there
is
so
much
that
we
can
do
there
are
so
many
whose
eyes
will
brighten
at
the
prizes
we
are
to
pluck
by
the
way
and
then
our
contests
are
to
be
won
without
stooping
to
the
stratagems
of
canvassing
we
are
to
head
our
polls
without
the
indignity
of
hedging
later
on
there
is
still
much
to
be
done
but
little
quite
so
well
worth
dying
for
as
our
own
hearts
and
the
poets
whispered
in
the
early
days
we
begin
to
suspect
too
that
providence
sends
biscuits
chiefly
to
those
who
have
no
teeth
our
dearest
aims
have
a
trick
of
eluding
us
and
leaving
the
tedious
hours
full
of
the
memories
of
spent
bubbles
the
rude
breath
of
in
the
life
of
shrivelled
so
many
tender
illusions
life
is
not
so
amusing
some
of
its
most
comical
jokes
are
elaborated
at
our
own
expense
this
kind
of
payment
impairs
one
s
sense
of
humour
and
those
myriad
orbs
that
were
to
sparkle
at
our
feats
alas
most
of
the
eyes
we
now
know
are
keen
only
to
detect
that
the
plumage
of
our
is
gray
rather
than
white
and
so
in
our
more
egotistical
these
come
to
question
may
arise
if
i
were
entirely
defeated
in
this
tiresome
drama
which
begins
in
youth
like
the
rising
of
a
curtain
on
a
fairy
scene
and
goes
on
like
a
scene
in
which
there
is
nothing
save
gold
how
many
would
really
stand
by
me
if
one
were
thus
defeated
in
fact
as
well
as
imagination
probably
the
very
best
thing
that
could
befall
one
would
be
to
find
one
s
self
in
the
australian
bush
not
very
far
from
a
so
at
least
it
proved
in
the
case
of
the
poor
woman
stella
courtland
had
come
upon
she
was
dangerously
ill
for
several
days
during
this
time
stella
and
langdale
saw
each
other
daily
and
drew
very
near
to
each
other
the
woman
s
first
coherent
inquiry
was
for
jack
which
turned
out
to
be
the
cockatoo
stella
brought
him
into
the
bedroom
the
woman
occupied
he
erected
his
crest
and
fluttered
about
muttering
imprecations
of
various
kinds
he
knows
me
sure
enough
said
his
mistress
in
a
gratified
tone
you
can
t
think
ma
am
what
a
comfort
it
was
to
hear
him
when
i
was
alone
he
do
swear
badly
but
it
was
like
having
a
christian
body
near
one
to
hear
him
he
never
come
back
i
didn
t
expect
he
would
after
hearing
the
shots
but
if
i
live
long
enough
bill
taylor
will
swing
for
it
the
the
saddle
miss
stella
it
took
care
of
she
started
up
in
bed
in
great
excitement
stella
assured
her
it
was
all
right
in
the
oh
but
i
must
get
must
see
it
i
ll
put
somethin
round
me
and
go
out
to
look
at
stella
thought
this
was
but
a
freak
of
the
fever
that
still
lingered
in
her
brain
and
to
keep
the
woman
quiet
she
sent
maisie
for
the
saddle
which
was
old
and
worn
and
externally
destitute
of
any
points
that
would
justify
one
in
setting
such
high
value
on
it
but
appearances
are
proverbially
deceitful
the
woman
clutched
it
eagerly
she
had
never
acquired
any
of
those
amenities
that
even
among
the
lower
orders
of
women
help
as
a
rule
to
keep
social
intercourse
on
a
higher
plane
than
the
primeval
scramble
in
which
egotism
was
the
sole
standard
of
conduct
and
yet
she
had
many
distinctly
human
qualities
maisie
went
out
of
the
room
and
resumed
her
sewing
in
the
nursery
where
the
upper
nurse
sat
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
is
your
young
lady
going
out
riding
this
morning
she
asked
indeed
jane
i
can
not
tell
ye
answered
maisie
with
a
toss
of
her
head
what
miss
stella
s
ma
would
say
to
her
nursing
an
person
like
yon
i
don
t
know
miss
stella
should
leave
her
till
us
and
then
she
d
be
cured
a
little
of
whims
and
whams
there
she
has
that
awfu
swearin
cockie
in
the
room
and
now
a
dirty
old
saddle
and
there
comes
the
doctor
i
wish
he
would
cure
her
soon
and
let
her
be
packing
with
her
duds
and
screws
of
servants
who
are
accustomed
to
the
refined
courtesy
of
gentlewomen
resent
nothing
more
strongly
than
being
spoken
to
roughly
this
indeed
is
one
of
the
causes
which
often
creates
a
disastrous
barrier
between
them
and
men
in
their
own
rank
the
sight
which
met
langdale
on
entering
the
that
morning
was
a
curious
one
the
large
dingy
cockatoo
stood
on
the
close
to
the
bed
muttering
hang
him
in
a
rough
deep
voice
the
patient
was
sitting
up
in
bed
an
old
saddle
turned
upside
down
before
her
the
lining
ripped
open
disclosing
underneath
one
side
a
deep
layer
of
extremely
soiled
on
the
other
nuggets
of
gold
ranging
from
the
size
of
peas
to
some
embedded
in
quartz
others
with
the
earth
still
clinging
to
them
stella
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
looking
on
in
silent
wonder
neither
had
heard
the
doctor
s
tap
and
even
when
he
opened
the
door
saying
may
i
come
in
the
patient
went
on
with
a
calculation
which
absorbed
all
her
faculties
yes
that
s
the
is
right
then
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
nine
and
five
twenties
and
two
fifties
and
the
i
fear
you
do
not
approve
of
this
proceeding
langdale
said
stella
as
they
shook
hands
if
anyone
is
to
be
blamed
it
s
me
sir
said
the
woman
who
seemed
to
be
thoroughly
roused
by
the
process
of
reckoning
up
the
hoard
before
her
the
doctor
tested
her
temperature
and
found
it
rather
high
if
you
throw
yourself
back
you
he
began
in
a
grave
voice
well
sir
i
know
it
makes
my
head
beat
but
it
would
have
been
worse
to
keep
on
thinking
p
r
aps
it
was
lost
i
don
t
rightly
remember
things
for
days
before
i
got
here
that
s
my
marriage
lines
ma
am
she
said
holding
out
a
very
soiled
slip
of
paper
to
stella
i
don
t
know
what
makes
you
so
good
to
me
such
an
object
as
i
must
have
been
when
you
saw
me
you
couldn
t
tell
what
sort
i
might
be
and
i
d
like
you
to
know
i
m
an
honest
woman
and
if
things
go
oh
things
will
go
all
right
if
you
keep
quiet
said
langdale
you
have
an
iron
thank
you
sir
but
i
d
sooner
tell
the
young
lady
and
you
how
it
was
in
case
and
then
i
know
i
ll
feel
more
restful
like
i
ve
laid
here
many
an
hour
turning
things
over
when
i
wasn
t
able
to
wag
my
tongue
i
don
t
know
whether
you
ve
heard
of
poor
man
s
diggings
ever
they
don
t
make
no
flare
but
from
seventy
to
eighty
men
have
been
working
there
quietly
for
two
years
jack
and
me
was
there
eighteen
s
my
husband
the
men
called
the
cockie
after
him
because
he
was
a
great
swearer
and
the
bird
was
the
dead
spit
of
him
in
that
way
jack
was
a
digger
and
we
had
a
little
general
store
and
a
shanty
but
he
was
fined
so
often
at
last
i
said
to
him
it
would
be
cheaper
to
take
out
a
license
and
so
he
did
but
he
took
to
hard
drinking
and
gambling
and
six
months
ago
we
left
for
we
had
enough
money
to
go
back
to
our
friends
in
sydney
we
was
both
born
there
there
was
no
one
to
take
the
license
off
our
hands
so
jack
carried
away
all
the
grog
that
was
left
and
that
was
the
ruin
of
him
when
we
came
across
any
teamsters
he
used
to
gamble
for
a
couple
of
days
at
a
time
i
ve
seen
him
play
at
poker
and
lose
two
bottles
of
rum
and
a
note
and
one
of
the
horses
all
within
an
hour
and
then
he
d
have
to
buy
his
horse
back
at
last
i
took
and
planted
the
money
and
the
gold
you
see
here
it
was
once
when
he
was
drinking
very
bad
and
gambling
with
a
little
man
called
bill
he
had
followed
us
from
the
t
any
rate
so
i
believe
though
he
pretended
to
come
upon
us
quite
by
accident
but
none
is
so
surprised
as
them
that
gives
their
mind
to
it
and
that
was
the
way
with
i
m
pretty
sure
jack
was
that
given
to
the
gamble
when
there
was
no
one
else
he
d
play
with
me
but
then
there
wasn
t
enough
go
in
it
for
if
he
lost
to
me
he
could
take
it
from
me
well
had
his
horse
and
swag
and
kep
us
company
for
near
a
month
winning
a
good
deal
more
money
nor
he
lost
at
last
when
jack
wasn
t
by
i
told
him
to
clear
and
i
d
give
him
twenty
pounds
without
no
playing
nor
cheating
he
was
a
unhonest
vermin
if
ever
there
lived
any
well
he
tuk
the
twenty
pounds
but
still
he
hung
round
till
one
day
we
camped
at
a
and
he
said
he
was
going
to
take
a
cut
off
for
the
nearest
railway
line
to
melbourne
in
the
morning
i
dunno
why
but
i
didn
t
b
lieve
him
certainly
he
never
told
the
truth
unless
he
had
an
accident
in
speaking
like
but
it
wasn
t
that
only
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
heard
a
noise
and
i
put
my
head
out
and
there
was
sitting
by
the
camp
fire
polishing
up
his
revolver
that
gave
me
a
turn
and
i
didn
t
sleep
another
wink
of
course
people
has
to
keep
their
firearms
in
order
travelling
in
the
bush
but
well
in
the
morning
jack
was
very
and
when
he
woke
up
he
didn
t
seem
inclined
to
make
an
early
start
no
more
did
i
gathered
up
the
things
and
the
horses
in
the
afternoon
and
saddled
hisen
then
just
as
i
thought
we
was
going
to
start
they
both
set
off
for
a
little
stroll
i
knowed
well
that
what
jack
wanted
was
to
gamble
he
had
took
a
bible
oath
to
me
two
days
afore
not
to
touch
a
card
with
again
and
he
was
shamed
to
do
it
before
me
many
s
the
time
since
i
wished
i
d
let
him
alone
but
i
meaned
it
for
good
though
it
come
out
very
crooked
i
made
signs
to
jack
to
come
to
me
and
ast
him
to
take
his
rifle
but
when
a
man
has
been
drinking
off
and
on
so
long
he
don
t
have
his
wits
about
him
much
to
speak
of
i
watched
em
go
out
of
sight
in
the
woods
and
all
to
once
i
began
to
cooey
after
jack
as
loud
as
i
could
but
he
never
turned
his
head
turned
round
and
waved
his
hand
with
a
grin
and
then
hobbled
on
he
had
a
wooden
leg
and
used
a
stick
and
there
was
his
lather
bag
with
the
revolver
on
his
back
i
waited
and
waited
but
they
didn
t
come
back
and
then
about
sunset
i
heard
two
after
she
uther
i
went
cold
all
over
and
if
you
b
lieve
me
i
felt
is
if
the
blood
was
running
out
of
my
side
and
a
horrid
burning
pain
i
sot
where
i
was
in
the
waggon
not
able
to
move
and
then
it
went
through
me
like
sparks
of
fire
ull
come
and
put
a
bullet
through
me
next
and
then
he
ll
have
everything
and
never
a
soul
to
peach
on
him
with
that
i
tuk
the
reins
and
made
a
start
and
then
i
thought
if
i
leave
his
horse
sambo
he
ll
overtake
me
in
no
time
so
i
put
a
piece
of
rope
round
his
neck
and
tied
him
to
the
waggon
he
had
got
used
to
following
like
that
when
jack
and
sot
playing
cards
and
i
druv
they
was
all
pretty
fresh
for
there
was
good
grass
round
the
and
we
had
spelled
for
nearly
two
days
everything
was
swimming
before
me
and
somehow
i
tuk
the
wrong
back
istid
of
going
towards
new
south
wales
boundary
i
thought
of
turning
round
but
there
was
coming
out
of
the
and
yelling
after
me
like
mad
i
just
whipped
up
the
horses
as
fast
as
they
would
go
and
sambo
come
on
after
the
waggon
fine
but
the
way
that
run
and
roared
no
one
would
b
lieve
it
made
me
go
cold
all
over
to
think
sambo
might
break
the
rope
and
fall
into
his
hands
but
he
didn
t
and
he
was
soon
out
of
sight
i
travelled
all
night
and
kep
the
horses
up
to
it
as
fast
as
they
would
go
and
took
cross
roads
next
day
they
was
so
knocked
up
i
had
to
spell
them
but
my
sleep
went
off
altogether
i
was
waiting
always
for
to
come
and
shoot
me
i
dunno
how
long
it
dunno
what
country
i
met
people
now
and
and
hawkers
mostly
and
i
passed
the
time
of
day
but
i
never
ast
one
a
question
i
d
got
to
be
suspicious
of
seemed
all
of
em
i
knew
such
a
poor
mean
lot
sometimes
when
i
passed
people
i
kept
up
a
talk
as
if
poor
jack
was
sitting
inside
but
at
night
that
made
me
feel
creepy
jill
began
to
be
very
raw
and
knocked
up
so
one
day
i
put
sambo
in
but
twas
as
if
the
very
mischief
was
in
him
he
broke
the
bridle
all
to
pieces
and
ran
away
with
all
of
us
till
he
couldn
t
move
everything
got
worn
out
when
i
put
the
other
bridle
on
him
that
was
broke
too
till
i
had
never
a
i
had
the
bits
but
nothing
rightly
to
fasten
them
to
not
that
it
mattered
much
for
they
was
now
that
with
no
grass
and
very
little
water
and
going
on
and
on
not
knowing
where
but
hoping
always
to
come
to
a
little
township
but
never
one
i
used
to
take
a
track
this
way
and
i
think
many
a
time
i
turned
my
back
straight
on
what
would
have
took
me
to
a
township
with
womenfolk
and
children
and
police
at
last
when
i
was
getting
to
know
i
d
got
some
sort
of
fever
on
me
i
met
a
hawker
and
i
asked
him
the
nearest
way
to
a
township
and
he
said
to
keep
on
and
i
d
come
to
narryhoouta
or
some
such
name
and
i
kep
on
but
i
lost
count
of
days
and
i
hadn
t
strength
to
take
the
horses
out
of
the
waggon
and
i
could
see
they
wouldn
t
go
much
farther
i
dozed
away
like
seeing
all
sorts
of
things
just
like
poor
jack
when
he
had
the
horrors
then
it
came
like
a
dream
that
a
young
lady
looked
in
at
me
and
spoke
to
me
so
gentle
i
couldn
t
hear
what
she
said
and
then
i
saw
more
ladies
but
everyone
was
so
kind
it
seemed
all
dreams
and
then
i
woke
up
at
nights
and
i
thought
maybe
tis
true
about
twas
a
deal
more
cheerfuller
than
i
ve
ever
heard
tell
about
heaven
what
with
one
soft
light
burning
and
no
crowd
and
one
kind
woman
to
attend
on
me
and
nothing
to
do
not
even
to
sing
but
just
lie
still
in
white
soft
things
and
no
awful
creaking
going
on
and
on
and
then
in
the
daytime
you
come
to
in
white
ma
am
i
just
used
to
shut
my
eyes
and
keep
still
for
fear
it
would
all
go
different
and
then
there
was
you
sir
as
kind
as
anyone
though
a
yes
but
i
ll
not
be
kind
if
you
say
any
more
said
langdale
very
gently
very
well
m
quite
content
to
lie
still
now
the
money
is
all
safe
and
the
young
lady
and
you
knows
all
yes
the
saddle
of
course
must
go
but
if
the
young
lady
would
put
the
notes
and
gold
away
till
i
get
about
and
if
i
don
t
there
s
the
address
of
my
father
and
mother
on
the
back
of
my
that
was
a
curious
little
characteristically
australian
said
langdale
after
they
had
left
the
leaving
claude
with
the
patient
and
were
strolling
toward
the
orchard
close
to
which
stella
had
discovered
a
hymenosperum
in
bloom
a
few
days
previously
yes
she
answered
slowly
it
seems
as
if
there
were
more
in
situations
that
belong
essentially
to
new
countries
that
reminds
me
of
a
little
story
i
heard
from
a
sick
man
before
i
left
may
i
hear
it
charity
is
if
you
are
good
as
the
children
how
can
i
be
otherwise
when
i
am
with
you
a
fine
for
saying
that
friends
do
not
pay
each
other
no
nor
yet
fine
each
other
for
telling
the
another
fine
but
seriously
you
do
not
know
how
bad
it
is
for
me
to
be
made
if
you
wish
to
malign
yourself
charity
you
must
get
a
more
sympathetic
what
has
put
you
into
this
mood
she
said
laughing
in
his
face
he
echoed
his
eyes
kindling
do
you
think
a
man
can
be
privileged
to
be
near
you
so
often
to
watch
your
gracious
kindliness
your
perfect
courtesy
your
varying
moods
each
one
more
charming
than
the
last
he
stopped
then
stella
who
had
grown
suddenly
pale
replied
in
a
voice
that
was
a
little
tremulous
werthester
freund
i
remit
all
those
fines
for
when
you
speak
like
that
i
feel
as
lowly
as
dunstan
s
at
this
they
both
laughed
for
stella
had
in
due
course
related
the
worthy
gardener
s
reflections
and
reminiscences
on
the
day
she
had
first
dressed
the
wounds
of
the
caravan
horses
as
they
were
called
their
sores
were
now
quite
healed
and
the
poor
animals
were
rapidly
putting
on
flesh
in
the
adjacent
indeed
sambo
had
been
observed
to
kick
up
his
heels
on
more
than
one
occasion
hush
said
stella
suddenly
there
are
strange
and
sure
enough
there
were
plaintive
calls
heard
on
the
banks
of
the
in
the
oolloolloo
near
which
the
two
were
then
standing
stella
stole
on
tiptoe
nearer
the
bank
and
langdale
followed
her
as
noiselessly
as
he
could
the
groves
resounded
with
these
cries
they
came
from
two
pigeons
on
the
brink
of
the
pool
it
would
be
difficult
to
name
any
other
birds
whose
plumage
forms
a
more
perfect
model
of
harmonious
tints
the
wings
gleamed
more
lustrously
than
precious
and
feathers
with
iridescent
gleams
as
of
on
the
coverts
a
deep
gleaming
purplish
tint
on
the
breast
and
the
legs
a
perfect
carmine
they
drank
repeatedly
of
the
water
rested
for
a
little
and
flew
on
their
way
westward
charming
woodland
drank
of
our
rested
in
the
shade
of
our
trees
and
then
flew
away
said
stella
wistfully
did
you
notice
she
added
what
soft
appealing
eyes
they
had
the
truth
was
that
langdale
had
watched
her
face
rather
than
the
pigeons
yes
they
were
lovely
he
answered
jesuitical
of
those
he
had
seen
while
his
words
conveyed
another
meaning
so
are
all
pigeons
eyes
stella
went
on
encouraged
by
her
friend
s
evident
enthusiasm
very
different
from
parrots
who
have
hard
beady
the
sweet
little
shell
parrots
perfect
sonnets
as
they
are
in
emerald
and
pale
and
parrots
scream
rather
badly
too
don
t
they
yes
but
there
are
times
when
they
warble
most
musically
not
only
the
smaller
kinds
like
the
shells
the
and
the
little
ones
with
faces
but
also
larger
ones
like
the
we
watched
some
of
them
in
the
orchard
the
other
day
wandering
on
the
ground
picking
up
seeds
and
things
and
making
the
gentlest
cooing
sounds
imaginable
the
male
bird
was
a
magnificent
creature
in
scarlet
and
dark
green
and
yellow
and
lazuline
and
while
chatting
after
this
fashion
they
reached
the
hymenosperum
a
beautiful
tree
of
eastern
australia
with
glossy
leaves
and
drooping
clusters
of
long
slender
from
eight
to
twelve
in
a
bunch
ranging
in
colour
from
delicate
cream
to
saffron
and
fragrant
as
stella
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
when
she
saw
the
tree
arrayed
in
opening
blooms
there
were
so
few
out
two
or
three
days
ago
she
cried
and
now
they
are
out
in
hundreds
but
that
is
always
the
way
in
our
spring
it
is
like
what
pliny
says
of
the
that
they
break
out
altogether
in
one
night
about
the
beginning
of
but
don
t
forget
said
langdale
smiling
that
pliny
the
elder
gave
good
reason
for
being
styled
but
this
tree
of
yours
is
perfectly
lovely
when
your
australian
trees
do
blossom
they
do
it
in
a
wonderfully
generous
how
exquisitely
scented
then
stella
drew
his
attention
to
a
bee
that
was
struggling
hard
to
penetrate
into
the
depths
of
one
of
the
deep
it
was
too
slender
for
the
industrious
creature
s
body
or
its
thighs
were
too
heavily
laden
with
wax
for
after
writhing
for
some
time
with
a
muffled
hum
the
bee
drew
out
its
head
and
shoulders
instead
however
of
going
to
any
of
the
myriad
flowers
around
it
still
clung
to
the
coveted
blossom
and
began
to
bite
a
hole
at
the
base
of
the
delicate
waxen
tube
so
as
to
get
at
its
honeyed
treasures
from
the
outside
i
must
put
that
into
my
country
journal
said
stella
do
you
put
everything
into
your
journal
asked
langdale
he
noticed
a
soft
flush
mantling
in
her
cheeks
as
she
answered
yes
spiders
and
bees
when
i
catch
them
writing
deep
morals
upon
nature
s
pages
as
a
special
favour
you
may
come
and
see
our
pet
spider
web
it
is
in
a
whose
first
spray
budded
yesterday
that
is
on
the
third
of
on
their
way
to
this
treasure
stella
pointed
out
wide
groups
of
her
favourite
now
in
full
a
clump
of
the
santa
maria
narcissus
blue
apennine
windflowers
and
other
wide
white
ones
of
the
japanese
variety
everywhere
golden
daffodils
and
settlements
of
the
polyanthus
how
little
notice
you
take
of
these
brilliant
bushes
of
flowers
charity
oh
the
petunias
and
rhodanthes
well
most
of
them
are
so
hard
and
scentless
with
a
cunning
pair
of
scissors
wire
and
a
few
sheets
of
paper
one
might
turn
out
basketfuls
of
these
you
would
hardly
know
from
the
now
how
can
you
urge
that
as
an
objection
when
you
love
the
native
immortelle
so
dearly
but
don
t
you
see
the
difference
between
flowers
so
much
cared
for
and
cultivated
and
those
that
spring
up
in
sandy
deserts
flowers
in
gardens
are
the
hebrews
with
prophets
and
leaders
and
angelic
visitations
but
when
marcus
aurelius
says
if
there
are
no
gods
it
is
ill
to
live
if
there
are
gods
it
is
well
to
die
is
an
everlasting
in
the
i
humbly
crave
pardon
for
my
foolish
objection
yet
i
am
glad
i
made
it
for
the
sake
of
your
this
is
our
said
stella
pausing
by
the
see
what
a
delicate
tracery
of
silk
and
light
it
is
with
a
little
woof
in
the
centre
now
is
that
to
turn
into
the
spiders
of
the
future
yes
i
imagine
so
when
the
time
is
fulfilled
said
langdale
looking
at
the
web
with
grave
attention
who
bent
this
spray
and
fastened
it
so
as
to
protect
the
web
i
did
you
see
this
tiny
most
exquisite
of
so
forlornly
exposed
to
all
the
caprices
of
fate
the
wind
and
insects
and
fowls
of
the
yes
we
all
live
at
each
other
s
cost
whether
we
dwell
in
palaces
or
the
crevices
of
a
tree
s
bark
but
the
spider
has
a
sterner
struggle
than
most
he
hangs
perpetually
in
suspense
unless
charity
devises
schemes
to
protect
him
but
why
does
she
watch
this
little
cocoon
with
so
much
interest
i
have
an
incredible
curiosity
to
see
one
or
more
infant
spiders
of
unblemished
life
ere
sin
could
blight
or
sorrow
fade
before
they
have
tasted
the
blood
of
a
fly
it
is
a
sorrowful
thought
that
though
i
have
seen
so
many
thousand
spiders
i
have
never
seen
an
innocent
one
he
laughed
but
all
the
time
one
who
observed
him
closely
might
see
that
he
was
becoming
more
constrained
and
preoccupied
as
if
there
were
some
struggle
going
on
in
his
mind
you
have
not
told
me
that
other
little
story
yet
suppose
you
tell
it
to
me
by
the
hymenosperum
tree
and
by
the
way
you
must
say
something
distinctive
about
that
graceful
that
will
go
with
the
image
of
it
when
it
rises
in
my
memory
tall
and
slender
arrayed
in
pale
saffron
like
an
eastern
i
am
sure
i
can
not
think
of
anything
more
distinctive
than
that
laughed
stella
i
shall
borrow
a
metaphor
and
give
it
to
you
as
a
saint
is
to
ordinary
good
people
so
is
a
hymenosperum
to
other
flowering
trees
here
is
our
tree
said
langdale
with
a
little
rural
seat
near
now
please
tell
me
your
she
told
him
thomson
s
little
narrative
not
forgetting
to
give
a
rapid
brilliant
little
sketch
of
her
old
friend
the
best
little
man
in
the
world
but
he
is
like
cheese
o
er
renneted
so
much
in
earnest
that
he
can
enjoy
hardly
any
of
the
play
of
i
think
we
may
put
that
down
as
a
tragic
situation
said
langdale
the
poor
man
trying
in
his
simple
fashion
to
christianize
the
savage
mother
of
his
child
and
the
two
breaking
into
loud
laughter
at
him
in
the
he
took
out
a
little
pocket
diary
as
he
spoke
and
with
it
an
unopened
letter
oh
i
had
forgotten
this
he
said
the
english
mail
was
delivered
as
i
left
the
house
this
do
you
put
aside
letters
without
reading
them
said
stella
in
surprise
well
not
as
a
rule
he
answered
smiling
but
there
were
family
letters
that
kept
me
occupied
till
i
got
here
and
then
you
know
at
lull
there
are
things
so
much
more
interesting
than
letters
from
one
s
you
may
read
it
will
excuse
you
said
stella
and
she
went
to
gather
clusters
of
the
fragrant
hymenosperum
blossoms
picking
out
those
that
had
just
opened
which
were
pale
cream
and
mixing
with
them
a
few
of
those
that
had
been
opened
a
few
days
which
had
assumed
a
delicate
saffron
tint
then
the
clear
musical
song
of
a
superb
warbler
rose
near
and
she
saw
one
on
a
laurustinus
bush
not
far
little
male
bird
gorgeous
in
its
spring
attire
of
shining
pale
azure
and
dark
blue
its
little
tail
erect
as
that
of
a
fan
tail
pigeon
stella
was
away
long
enough
to
permit
the
perusal
of
many
pages
but
when
she
returned
langdale
still
stood
engrossed
with
his
letter
he
looked
hard
at
the
girl
as
she
drew
near
to
him
and
his
face
usually
so
calm
betrayed
curious
signs
of
agitation
you
have
had
no
ill
news
i
hope
said
stella
softly
ill
news
charity
is
it
but
i
have
no
right
to
force
your
confidence
only
there
are
affairs
that
hasten
my
departure
for
there
is
something
i
want
to
know
will
you
think
my
curiosity
an
abuse
of
our
friendship
oh
no
i
am
sure
i
shall
not
she
answered
promptly
you
engaged
to
be
married
certainly
not
i
was
once
for
a
short
time
she
added
colouring
deeply
but
it
was
a
she
saw
his
eyes
suddenly
grow
radiant
then
sweet
charity
i
am
going
to
ask
a
great
favour
may
i
write
to
you
after
i
get
to
england
his
face
was
very
pale
and
his
voice
shaken
no
one
who
heard
and
saw
him
could
deem
that
the
permission
he
asked
was
concerned
with
the
interchange
of
merely
friendly
sentiments
least
of
all
stella
whose
quick
insight
played
round
even
indifferent
matters
with
the
fellowship
of
wide
sympathy
she
struggled
with
some
rising
emotion
but
her
voice
was
clear
and
firm
as
she
answered
may
and
here
is
a
little
bouquet
i
have
gathered
for
he
took
it
and
held
it
to
his
lips
and
then
for
a
little
time
as
they
turned
homeward
neither
spoke
there
are
moments
in
life
when
speech
is
an
words
the
most
winged
and
penetrating
are
too
for
the
thoughts
that
rise
in
endless
and
golden
as
glancing
upon
waves
i
shall
write
to
your
mother
and
hector
you
know
at
the
same
time
he
said
as
they
drew
near
the
house
but
the
longest
letter
must
be
to
me
she
answered
trying
to
speak
lightly
and
it
must
be
very
wise
and
partly
in
when
do
you
leave
charity
on
the
days
from
this
and
you
i
should
like
to
leave
the
same
day
you
do
only
i
must
stay
till
morrison
gets
his
assistant
he
is
overdone
and
overworked
but
he
is
advertising
in
the
melbourne
and
adelaide
papers
i
shall
be
back
in
four
months
i
suppose
from
the
time
i
sail
will
he
stopped
abruptly
he
was
evidently
struggling
with
conflicting
currents
of
thought
stella
who
in
the
tumult
of
her
own
emotion
was
keenly
conscious
of
the
agitation
that
betrayed
itself
in
langdale
s
voice
and
manner
tried
in
vain
to
speak
of
some
indifferent
subject
but
seeing
louise
near
at
hand
among
the
shrubs
her
courage
returned
xxxiii
stella
sat
that
night
writing
till
late
and
then
for
hours
by
her
open
window
looking
into
the
starry
skies
an
expression
of
peaceful
happiness
on
her
face
which
for
a
time
was
unclouded
by
even
a
passing
shadow
she
had
been
sure
for
many
days
past
that
her
ideal
friendship
was
in
peril
she
knew
that
time
after
time
words
and
questions
had
risen
to
langdale
s
lips
which
he
had
kept
back
she
had
seen
that
he
strove
with
contending
emotions
and
once
or
twice
she
had
lightly
parried
one
of
those
leading
questions
which
if
not
turned
aside
would
have
been
as
the
letting
in
of
waters
she
found
it
so
entirely
exquisite
the
bliss
of
loving
and
being
loved
without
the
gadgrind
of
outside
opinion
without
the
desperate
seriousness
of
having
to
think
of
the
future
as
a
fixed
imponderable
menacing
responsibility
nay
without
any
avowal
spoken
by
the
lips
and
now
the
precious
secret
would
be
hers
for
four
long
months
to
come
there
would
be
no
interchange
of
vows
no
assurances
they
had
met
as
friends
and
as
friends
they
would
part
she
laughed
a
low
glad
laugh
to
herself
as
she
pictured
esther
s
face
when
she
would
tell
her
this
it
would
be
quite
he
returned
till
he
returned
how
her
heart
beat
at
the
thought
if
he
left
in
october
he
might
be
back
in
march
at
the
latest
the
late
roses
would
be
still
in
bloom
and
the
chrysanthemums
would
be
coming
in
he
loved
her
to
wear
great
clusters
of
roses
at
the
throat
what
time
of
day
would
it
be
when
he
came
to
the
dear
old
fairacre
home
she
hoped
it
would
be
before
the
lamps
were
lit
there
would
be
great
china
bowlfuls
of
roses
in
the
hall
and
delicate
pink
and
pale
japanese
chrysanthemums
i
love
the
japanese
for
making
a
festival
in
honour
of
this
flower
she
thought
and
then
she
mused
over
strange
countries
would
they
see
them
all
together
oh
what
leaps
to
make
and
they
had
not
yet
been
betrothed
yes
in
the
twilight
there
would
be
a
golden
glow
lingering
in
the
west
and
far
above
that
the
inimitable
colour
which
steals
so
often
into
the
evening
sky
when
the
wearying
languor
of
the
long
summer
is
over
no
that
was
a
burlesque
of
the
real
tint
there
was
in
it
the
pink
of
wet
and
a
faint
tinge
of
a
very
pale
lilac
pansy
and
over
all
a
divine
haze
as
if
a
great
white
star
had
been
melted
in
the
air
what
name
was
there
for
such
a
colour
as
that
none
what
name
was
there
for
the
flood
of
happiness
that
thrilled
her
through
when
their
eyes
and
hands
met
at
parting
love
but
all
the
dreadful
commonplace
earthly
creatures
who
ever
got
engaged
took
that
word
in
vain
come
back
ye
wandering
little
imps
of
thoughts
and
finish
this
twilight
scene
would
she
be
in
the
garden
when
he
came
of
course
she
would
know
about
what
time
the
vessel
would
reach
glenelg
it
would
be
telegraphed
first
from
king
george
s
sound
and
in
less
than
four
days
afterwards
it
would
be
sighted
off
cape
borda
when
tom
went
to
his
office
that
morning
she
would
take
him
aside
and
say
can
you
keep
a
secret
i
don
t
suppose
you
can
you
mustn
t
laugh
you
mustn
t
cry
you
must
do
the
best
you
what
is
it
baby
have
you
given
away
your
last
to
honora
or
some
other
old
vagabond
and
haven
t
got
a
pair
of
gloves
to
put
on
no
tom
it
isn
t
that
but
what
would
be
the
name
of
the
ship
the
or
the
some
such
name
very
likely
but
she
would
give
it
one
of
her
where
did
that
come
from
oh
from
some
lines
her
old
french
master
had
taught
her
telling
of
a
custom
the
village
maidens
had
in
france
for
testing
how
much
they
were
beloved
la
blanche
et
simple
paquerette
que
ton
coeur
consult
surtout
dit
ton
amant
tendre
filette
j
aime
un
peu
beaucoup
point
du
tout
yes
but
the
is
coming
in
and
i
want
to
know
the
exact
time
she
reaches
glenelg
send
me
a
telegram
oh
put
it
in
your
official
and
whatever
you
do
don
t
forget
ah
you
are
very
good
i
know
you
never
forget
but
this
is
more
important
than
the
creation
of
the
world
or
the
christian
era
or
she
wouldn
t
go
anywhere
that
day
and
if
any
visitors
came
she
would
retreat
into
the
dear
old
little
library
with
the
pale
cretonne
curtains
with
brown
sedges
and
all
over
them
she
had
bought
them
herself
when
the
green
damask
ones
had
grown
so
very
faded
and
she
had
climbed
up
on
the
ladder
to
fasten
them
and
caught
sight
of
a
little
row
of
books
behind
the
old
divinity
ones
that
were
never
disturbed
and
the
first
one
she
took
up
was
she
read
twenty
pages
of
it
standing
on
the
ladder
was
there
any
domain
of
life
so
pungently
vulgar
as
those
twenty
pages
or
were
books
like
hidden
away
behind
tomes
of
divinity
because
these
last
were
so
and
children
might
read
the
others
were
too
true
to
be
left
within
reach
would
she
ever
tell
anselm
well
perhaps
if
he
persisted
in
calling
her
charity
what
beautiful
intonations
there
were
in
his
voice
when
he
was
talking
very
gravely
and
how
deep
and
steadfast
his
eyes
were
would
he
ever
look
angrily
at
her
sometimes
she
had
tried
to
provoke
him
but
the
more
she
tried
the
more
he
was
amused
but
then
after
years
of
married
life
would
not
some
taint
of
marital
coldness
creep
into
his
manner
heavens
what
a
bound
to
they
had
not
yet
met
she
would
retreat
into
the
library
if
visitors
came
that
day
but
she
would
be
unable
to
read
nothing
that
ever
was
written
could
interest
a
girl
who
was
waiting
for
the
beloved
of
her
only
man
she
ever
loved
or
ever
could
love
oh
what
a
dreadful
creature
she
had
been
to
think
of
marrying
when
her
heart
had
been
as
unmoved
as
the
nether
millstone
what
could
have
possessed
her
on
that
steel
gray
day
in
june
when
ted
pressed
his
suit
so
ardently
and
laid
his
thirteen
thousands
a
year
at
her
feet
and
told
her
he
could
never
care
for
anyone
but
herself
and
at
last
she
gave
a
shuddering
consent
and
he
trembled
with
happiness
and
she
allowed
him
to
kiss
her
great
heavens
how
could
she
she
rose
up
and
laved
her
face
in
cold
water
as
she
thought
of
it
she
wished
that
no
one
had
ever
loved
her
and
yet
how
could
she
tell
that
she
could
not
have
loved
anyone
but
anselm
if
no
one
else
had
wooed
her
but
then
she
should
not
have
found
it
so
amusing
yes
she
knew
well
she
had
a
thread
of
the
coquette
in
her
she
liked
to
know
that
people
thought
her
charming
and
admired
her
how
unworldly
she
had
been
at
one
time
how
incredible
it
seemed
that
her
keenest
ideal
of
joy
had
been
to
give
herself
wholly
to
the
lowliest
services
of
life
what
voices
were
these
that
came
wandering
back
austere
with
renunciations
and
sleepless
vigils
poor
earthworm
yearning
for
security
in
the
contentments
of
this
fleeting
perpetual
to
the
delusion
of
perfect
earthly
how
slight
a
breeze
may
scatter
thy
as
a
gust
of
wind
levels
a
small
hast
thou
forgotten
what
a
thankless
runaway
slave
is
joy
she
had
read
so
many
of
the
saints
and
fathers
she
could
have
run
on
in
homilies
for
hours
but
after
all
there
was
something
unreal
in
their
depreciation
of
spoke
in
the
hieratic
style
as
anselm
had
said
would
she
get
into
the
trick
of
quoting
him
eternally
as
so
many
wives
did
wives
do
people
ever
know
how
bold
girls
can
be
in
their
imagination
no
she
could
not
read
while
she
waited
she
would
sit
in
the
chair
in
which
her
father
always
sat
when
he
taught
the
three
of
alice
and
herself
how
kind
and
gentle
he
always
he
taught
them
to
love
the
best
books
and
make
fast
friends
of
them
and
as
far
as
in
them
lay
to
do
good
to
all
men
how
brave
and
pure
and
just
his
life
had
full
of
kindly
deeds
and
thoughts
and
yet
to
the
last
his
mind
retained
that
lambent
play
of
humorous
quick
perception
of
what
was
droll
or
incongruous
she
could
see
the
quiet
that
played
so
habitually
round
his
lips
only
two
days
before
his
death
she
had
read
to
him
some
scenes
out
of
that
was
a
strange
awakening
before
dawn
when
at
the
last
the
end
came
so
unexpectedly
the
cocks
were
crowing
when
kirsty
called
herself
and
alice
and
there
was
a
strange
grayness
on
his
face
when
they
entered
the
room
how
often
since
when
she
woke
at
she
had
gone
over
the
story
of
her
father
s
even
of
the
day
on
which
he
first
saw
then
his
brilliant
student
days
when
he
had
won
scholarly
distinctions
and
the
long
vacation
one
summer
when
he
met
his
future
bride
in
the
old
surrey
deanery
where
she
was
spending
the
summer
she
was
nearly
and
he
was
and
a
year
later
they
were
married
and
now
it
was
all
over
but
somewhere
that
spirit
so
keen
to
feel
and
love
up
to
the
last
was
enshrined
in
a
fuller
larger
life
than
that
can
ever
be
where
the
soul
is
clogged
by
a
material
companion
could
anselm
be
now
content
to
believe
that
we
became
a
thread
in
the
living
garment
of
the
infinite
only
by
being
transmuted
into
lowlier
forms
how
quickly
they
had
crept
into
each
other
s
modes
of
thought
and
opinions
and
most
cherished
fancies
they
never
spoke
to
others
of
the
things
they
discussed
together
would
they
ever
listen
to
each
other
with
a
yawn
and
even
forget
in
time
the
anniversary
of
their
what
married
they
were
not
yet
plighted
lovers
well
when
the
visitors
were
gone
she
would
go
back
into
the
and
watch
the
clock
the
sun
was
setting
and
the
had
come
in
at
five
would
she
stay
in
the
garden
till
some
one
came
and
told
her
he
had
come
yes
of
course
alice
would
know
and
her
mother
for
anselm
was
going
to
write
to
her
from
england
what
would
she
wear
pink
de
and
cashmere
and
scarlet
fairy
roses
she
would
pluck
them
at
sunset
so
that
they
would
be
fresh
and
fragrant
and
at
that
moment
alice
would
skim
down
the
he
is
here
stella
your
friend
has
come
her
heart
beat
so
loud
and
hard
that
she
placed
her
hand
over
it
she
went
up
through
the
that
bent
under
its
great
clusters
of
fantail
carolling
overhead
mad
with
mirth
as
though
it
had
sipped
some
frantic
liquor
and
now
she
was
in
the
hall
her
hand
was
on
the
door
stella
then
she
shrank
from
his
encircling
arms
with
the
thought
i
am
glad
it
will
be
yet
four
months
before
we
meet
as
lovers
and
then
a
quick
sudden
fear
awoke
in
her
heart
oh
my
love
you
have
come
back
all
the
way
across
the
salt
dividing
sea
and
with
that
she
burst
into
low
sobs
oh
the
way
is
so
far
and
sometimes
there
are
dreadful
storms
she
moaned
the
adder
that
lies
ever
at
the
heart
of
passion
had
awakened
and
stung
her
what
light
was
this
stealing
into
the
room
she
looked
at
the
stars
and
found
them
pale
and
shrunken
there
was
no
need
to
turn
to
the
east
for
tidings
of
the
dawn
already
the
birds
had
learned
the
secret
a
boobook
owl
gave
a
loud
sad
as
if
the
light
had
suddenly
smitten
it
blind
a
curlew
called
in
the
distance
by
the
oolloolloo
and
near
at
hand
some
magpies
began
their
finished
trills
and
flutings
but
stopped
short
as
they
seemed
on
the
point
of
breaking
into
the
mellow
ripeness
of
summer
song
there
are
some
dawns
that
enfold
the
earth
as
with
the
unspeakable
beauty
of
holiness
this
was
one
of
them
there
was
none
of
the
fiery
splendour
that
so
often
heralds
day
in
in
the
summer
when
the
whole
east
is
often
kindled
into
a
throbbing
ocean
of
almost
intolerable
beauty
but
this
divine
hue
was
the
selfsame
color
d
oriental
that
blessed
dante
s
sight
when
he
escaped
from
the
murky
atmosphere
of
hell
morn
treading
proudly
on
golden
sandals
spread
from
horizon
to
horizon
till
it
seemed
as
if
day
were
added
to
day
and
the
whole
world
overflowed
with
light
it
was
so
keenly
luminous
that
the
trees
on
the
messmate
ranges
stood
sharply
outlined
instead
of
being
merged
in
a
continuous
mass
of
foliage
then
gradually
a
deep
stole
into
the
east
as
if
halls
were
disclosed
heaped
up
and
running
over
with
never
does
heaven
draw
so
near
earth
and
the
earth
lie
so
open
to
heaven
as
in
those
moments
when
we
can
first
say
it
is
morning
stella
could
not
remain
within
doors
she
threw
a
soft
woollen
shawl
over
her
shoulders
and
went
out
among
the
shrubs
and
trees
there
was
a
great
bush
of
rosamond
s
glory
near
the
front
of
the
house
and
the
heavy
clusters
of
burning
red
roses
that
open
their
hearts
so
lavishly
to
the
wind
keeping
back
no
folded
petal
drew
her
to
them
as
with
silken
cords
the
roses
quivered
fitfully
in
the
breeze
scattering
their
petals
on
the
ground
where
they
glowed
like
delicate
leaflets
of
vivid
flame
oh
what
passionate
prodigals
you
are
to
shed
yourselves
on
the
relentless
earth
in
this
fashion
why
do
you
not
tarry
a
little
longer
you
generous
spendthrifts
said
stella
softly
looking
at
them
with
dimmed
eyes
why
did
the
tears
rise
so
quickly
when
beforetime
they
came
to
her
so
tardily
had
the
weak
destiny
of
a
woman
at
last
overtaken
her
the
dawn
had
always
before
been
so
full
of
joy
and
a
great
exulting
the
triumph
of
light
over
darkness
the
glad
beginning
of
a
new
day
but
now
it
was
strangely
solemn
charged
with
thoughts
of
those
who
had
been
and
were
no
more
of
quiet
chambers
in
which
women
had
watched
their
dying
children
their
husbands
their
lovers
oh
the
sadness
and
the
strange
mystery
of
those
changes
that
strike
a
chill
to
the
heart
in
its
gladdest
hours
of
fruition
how
many
there
were
to
whom
the
pale
splendour
of
this
dawn
brought
only
the
awakening
consciousness
of
a
life
emptied
of
joy
how
many
idylls
of
youth
and
love
would
come
to
a
tragic
close
before
night
fell
once
more
upon
land
and
sea
there
were
husbandmen
sowing
grain
which
they
would
never
reap
young
mothers
making
garments
for
babes
that
would
never
see
the
light
of
day
men
working
and
waiting
for
brides
that
would
never
be
theirs
gallant
ships
sailing
the
main
which
would
never
reach
their
haven
oh
why
did
these
dismal
thoughts
rise
in
that
hour
full
of
the
budding
promise
of
the
crowning
happiness
of
life
and
all
the
time
every
bird
that
had
a
note
was
pouring
out
melody
ceaselessly
vehemently
as
if
it
would
sing
its
little
heart
into
shreds
the
sparrows
were
deafening
each
other
with
their
breathless
high
above
this
rose
the
clear
sweet
treble
of
the
fantails
one
might
suppose
that
the
swallows
saw
glancing
water
for
the
first
time
so
buoyantly
did
they
skim
its
surface
singing
snatches
of
madrigals
the
while
that
were
composed
long
before
the
first
scratched
rude
figures
on
stones
among
the
bamboos
the
poured
out
with
pauseless
haste
those
melodious
but
capricious
lays
in
which
many
stolen
goods
are
brought
to
light
now
a
stave
from
a
warbling
then
a
careless
parody
of
the
swallow
s
tittering
anon
the
cadence
of
a
s
in
between
liquid
blithe
little
legends
all
their
own
they
are
perfect
little
rogues
these
brown
water
songsters
thought
stella
with
a
smile
they
have
as
wide
a
range
of
musical
sounds
as
sir
thomas
more
s
wife
who
took
lessons
on
the
lute
the
cithara
the
viol
the
monochord
and
the
flute
which
she
daily
practised
to
her
man
and
i
can
not
play
a
single
instrument
though
i
love
music
so
insanely
if
anselm
is
fond
of
musical
evenings
we
must
get
a
merlodeon
at
this
thought
she
laughed
outright
and
then
she
went
inside
lest
she
might
be
seen
in
evening
attire
like
a
strayed
it
was
now
close
on
sunrise
and
smoke
was
ascending
from
the
kitchen
chimney
from
the
men
s
hut
near
the
and
dunstan
s
cottage
she
knew
that
sleep
was
impossible
but
after
bathing
and
putting
on
a
crisp
morning
dress
she
felt
quite
refreshed
but
how
endless
the
day
seemed
at
ten
o
clock
it
was
difficult
to
realize
that
so
much
of
the
day
still
lay
before
her
at
that
hour
a
note
came
from
langdale
to
courtland
explaining
that
he
would
be
unable
to
visit
parr
the
caravan
woman
as
the
servants
called
her
on
that
day
as
he
was
going
to
see
some
sick
people
at
a
distance
for
morrison
there
was
a
message
to
charity
directing
her
to
take
the
patient
s
temperature
and
permit
her
to
sit
up
for
some
hours
if
it
was
not
over
one
hundred
and
one
stella
carried
out
these
instructions
and
wrote
a
note
for
the
patient
to
a
brother
in
melbourne
then
morton
and
julia
came
to
ask
all
the
lull
household
to
spend
the
day
after
the
next
at
broadmead
it
being
the
fortieth
anniversary
of
and
morton
s
i
don
t
suppose
hector
and
claude
will
come
till
the
evening
but
you
three
and
the
older
children
can
come
early
in
the
day
it
does
seem
like
a
tale
that
john
and
i
should
be
married
for
forty
years
and
never
a
cross
word
in
all
that
time
my
dear
she
said
turning
to
stella
not
one
cross
word
mamma
and
claude
and
i
have
not
been
married
a
year
and
we
have
had
lots
of
little
rows
but
then
i
think
it
s
more
interesting
for
we
are
always
better
friends
afterwards
said
claude
reflectively
well
my
dear
people
must
have
their
own
way
but
i
prefer
always
to
give
in
said
morton
and
when
i
don
t
really
give
in
your
papa
has
so
got
into
the
habit
he
thinks
i
do
and
now
my
dear
tell
me
about
your
on
being
thus
appealed
to
stella
told
the
curious
little
story
she
had
heard
the
previous
day
oh
my
dear
if
miss
kibwell
only
heard
that
story
she
would
make
something
quite
beautiful
out
of
it
said
morton
enthusiastically
and
then
she
went
on
to
tell
who
miss
kibwell
young
english
lady
who
wrote
such
beautiful
stories
for
pious
english
magazines
we
met
her
at
basle
dear
where
papa
and
i
stayed
for
a
month
and
there
was
a
french
curé
staying
at
the
same
hotel
he
spoke
english
nicely
and
when
i
pointed
out
to
him
the
evils
of
idolatry
he
listened
to
me
most
attentively
i
gave
him
two
tracts
on
mariolatry
and
he
thanked
me
quite
nicely
and
put
them
into
his
pocket
i
prayed
for
him
at
sunset
regularly
as
i
noticed
that
about
that
time
he
always
read
his
poor
popish
breviary
and
do
you
know
my
dear
this
young
english
lady
made
such
a
pretty
story
of
this
for
in
the
she
showed
how
when
the
curé
was
at
his
popish
prayers
some
i
think
she
called
at
work
with
him
till
at
last
the
hail
mary
stuck
in
his
throat
and
he
could
not
get
it
out
she
showed
how
my
few
words
and
the
tracts
worked
on
him
so
that
at
last
he
had
to
renounce
his
errors
and
then
at
the
end
she
made
what
she
called
a
of
and
with
three
or
four
whole
family
saying
the
lord
s
prayer
at
sunset
on
the
very
spot
where
the
lady
from
was
me
my
dear
met
him
but
the
editor
of
in
the
changed
this
into
the
family
going
to
church
on
sunday
morning
for
he
feared
some
of
his
readers
might
find
a
popish
taint
in
prayers
at
sunset
oh
they
are
wonderfully
careful
in
these
pious
magazines
not
a
word
of
the
worse
things
that
really
happen
will
they
allow
into
their
stella
to
whom
this
little
tale
was
chiefly
related
listened
with
both
ears
nor
did
her
interest
relax
when
the
good
lady
took
up
her
parable
about
langdale
whose
speedy
departure
was
a
subject
of
thrilling
interest
and
to
return
again
so
soon
it
must
be
some
very
important
piece
of
business
had
anyone
died
or
what
had
happened
said
julia
in
the
sharp
way
in
which
she
invariably
hankered
after
the
concrete
facts
that
underlay
events
he
said
it
was
some
private
family
matter
returned
courtland
and
that
he
expected
to
be
back
in
australia
again
in
four
well
that
was
just
what
we
heard
from
morrison
as
we
came
through
minjah
millowie
said
julia
it
seems
funny
doesn
t
it
for
one
to
go
for
such
a
short
time
very
recently
miss
morton
had
written
to
tareling
a
letter
in
which
the
words
occurred
you
may
depend
the
next
news
you
hear
will
be
that
of
the
engagement
of
stella
and
langdale
stella
picked
up
a
dying
least
she
turned
out
not
to
be
is
attending
her
so
they
see
more
of
each
other
than
indeed
so
great
an
impression
had
this
made
on
miss
morton
s
mind
that
though
haydon
had
been
the
previous
sunday
at
broadmead
she
had
not
stirred
beyond
the
veranda
still
it
was
comforting
to
know
that
he
had
made
one
or
two
artless
plans
to
lure
her
away
beyond
the
family
circle
the
afternoon
turned
out
very
cloudy
and
sultry
tantaro
the
native
boy
had
had
an
accident
with
duke
a
few
days
previously
in
riding
to
one
of
the
in
jumping
a
fence
the
horse
had
struck
his
near
and
cut
it
so
badly
that
he
could
not
be
ridden
for
some
days
louise
had
not
ridden
for
many
years
so
there
was
not
a
great
choice
of
ladies
horses
there
was
andy
voted
an
impossible
little
animal
by
stella
and
there
was
norman
just
then
in
a
distant
part
of
the
run
and
orlando
who
was
in
the
close
to
the
house
but
had
an
evil
name
he
has
splendid
paces
and
a
head
like
an
arab
pleaded
stella
yes
but
he
has
a
concealed
vice
which
is
now
an
open
secret
returned
her
brother
hector
he
shies
at
the
most
unexpected
moments
yes
you
ll
be
on
your
guard
if
you
see
a
lumbering
or
a
white
log
lying
close
to
the
road
or
anything
else
that
a
nervous
horse
objects
to
but
how
if
he
gives
a
sudden
swerve
when
you
are
cantering
along
a
tract
as
smooth
and
level
as
a
in
that
case
i
should
either
stick
in
my
saddle
or
have
a
fall
and
that
reminds
me
i
ve
never
had
as
many
falls
as
people
say
go
to
the
making
of
a
good
rider
hadn
t
i
better
improve
the
shining
hour
you
keeping
out
of
mischief
no
baby
you
must
have
no
experimental
bursters
when
you
ride
alone
you
can
have
andy
to
go
anywhere
with
and
you
can
ride
orlando
in
the
then
on
thursday
you
may
have
stella
rode
orlando
once
or
twice
round
the
and
highly
approved
of
him
it
is
true
he
shied
once
or
twice
but
nothing
to
signify
to
anyone
who
knew
how
to
sit
in
a
saddle
on
this
dark
sultry
afternoon
she
felt
an
uncontrollable
longing
to
ride
for
miles
in
the
open
air
she
was
weary
but
she
could
not
sleep
restless
and
unable
to
work
she
would
ride
to
the
wicked
wood
it
was
only
between
seven
and
eight
miles
away
with
a
road
leading
through
it
little
frequented
by
any
save
riders
or
the
light
vehicles
of
surrounding
squatters
or
people
journeying
between
minjah
millowie
and
nareen
this
wood
had
made
a
strange
impression
on
stella
it
was
only
a
few
days
previously
that
she
had
written
of
it
to
her
sister
esther
are
there
such
tracts
of
utter
desolation
in
any
other
country
acres
upon
acres
nay
in
one
direction
mile
after
mile
with
each
tree
bleached
and
bare
as
the
planks
of
a
wrecked
ship
that
has
lain
for
centuries
on
the
coast
of
an
uninhabited
island
they
are
tall
and
gaunt
and
white
standing
close
to
each
other
so
that
their
poor
each
other
overhead
they
look
as
though
they
had
been
convulsed
with
throes
of
mortal
agony
and
were
then
suddenly
petrified
they
are
like
the
numberless
trunks
and
bones
of
dead
things
reared
in
air
instead
of
being
kindly
hidden
in
the
bosom
of
the
great
mother
are
the
limbs
of
living
trees
twisted
and
twirled
and
twined
and
twinged
in
this
way
is
it
possible
that
bark
and
leaves
and
the
breath
of
life
have
such
magic
that
they
do
not
let
us
catch
one
glimpse
of
the
real
anatomy
of
a
tree
until
their
masking
raiment
is
entirely
gone
some
of
the
great
old
trees
in
the
wicked
wood
have
through
all
these
years
kept
their
tiniest
twigs
in
extraordinary
completeness
standing
under
them
and
looking
upward
they
look
more
like
delicate
carving
in
ivory
like
marvellous
etching
in
and
pure
white
against
a
deep
blue
background
rather
than
the
corpse
of
what
was
once
dense
foliage
it
seems
as
if
no
great
storm
could
ever
have
swept
through
the
wood
since
it
became
a
of
trees
whose
hold
of
life
was
so
strong
that
even
in
death
they
stand
upright
else
how
is
it
that
those
delicate
cobwebs
of
interlacing
twigs
those
fine
slender
branches
dry
and
as
an
old
have
not
been
strewn
in
crumbling
dust
i
had
almost
said
underfoot
there
is
a
little
sad
with
wide
patches
of
yellow
sand
showing
between
i
thought
the
mallee
country
round
goonjooree
might
be
taken
as
a
type
of
the
most
weird
aspect
of
our
scenery
but
the
mallee
sinks
into
tameness
compared
to
the
wicked
wood
it
seems
to
stretch
out
unseen
arms
and
compel
you
to
stand
and
look
from
tree
to
tree
and
try
to
draw
in
the
secret
of
its
strange
fascination
it
is
too
terrible
one
says
and
then
because
of
this
one
visits
the
place
again
and
again
it
nourishes
the
imagination
there
are
some
spots
in
it
of
which
i
dream
by
night
in
the
daytime
i
try
to
think
of
stories
into
which
they
could
come
but
then
their
lean
detachment
from
all
the
glad
life
of
the
world
around
freezes
the
impish
fancies
that
seek
to
give
them
a
local
habitation
and
a
name
the
wicked
wood
is
a
sort
of
belt
half
a
mile
wide
as
one
passes
through
it
from
here
to
nareen
but
miles
away
on
each
side
to
the
right
hand
and
to
the
left
a
mile
further
on
within
sight
of
nareen
there
is
a
wide
stringy
bark
valley
in
which
a
bush
fire
raged
not
very
long
ago
it
must
have
leapt
from
tree
to
tree
and
up
the
trunks
to
the
very
tips
of
the
branches
for
all
are
blackened
and
charred
and
many
are
dead
but
most
of
them
have
put
forth
young
twigs
and
leaves
some
among
them
are
indeed
a
perfect
idyll
of
a
mass
of
tender
young
leaves
clad
in
pale
green
the
youngest
and
smallest
of
them
tinged
with
a
pure
bronzy
shade
fluttering
above
the
charred
branches
and
along
the
trunks
as
if
planted
by
some
fantastic
gardener
in
hidden
now
that
the
thought
the
way
is
so
long
and
the
sea
so
treacherous
kept
rising
in
her
mind
like
the
refrain
of
a
ballad
heard
long
ago
and
chiming
perpetually
beyond
her
power
to
still
it
these
gaunt
writhing
trees
seemed
to
draw
her
to
them
as
by
a
spell
it
lay
in
her
nature
to
seek
serenity
in
a
scene
that
had
not
one
of
the
charms
which
ordinarily
woo
the
heart
the
cultured
beauty
of
the
home
field
with
its
wealth
of
leafing
trees
and
budding
roses
and
spring
flowers
disquieted
her
xxxiv
stella
resolved
that
she
would
merely
reach
the
wicked
wood
and
then
unsleeping
guard
on
orlando
all
the
time
not
even
the
sight
of
two
geobasileus
birds
twittering
on
a
dwarf
honeysuckle
near
the
road
made
her
forget
to
be
cautious
though
their
notes
were
symptomatic
of
housekeeping
and
one
of
their
curious
double
nests
was
a
thing
she
much
longed
to
see
orlando
seemed
to
enjoy
the
spin
as
much
as
his
that
was
saying
much
those
who
love
riding
find
a
fascination
in
the
exercise
it
would
be
difficult
to
define
care
or
the
shadow
of
trouble
has
in
it
something
unreal
while
the
motion
of
a
horse
seems
to
add
a
new
strength
and
buoyancy
to
one
s
flagging
vitality
the
air
is
lighter
the
horizon
widens
heaven
is
nearer
and
the
songs
of
birds
come
in
ecstatic
rain
while
mile
after
mile
of
forest
or
wood
or
plain
is
rapidly
passed
within
a
mile
of
the
wicked
wood
dustiefoot
lagged
behind
and
barked
in
a
way
that
told
his
mistress
he
was
out
of
breath
she
slackened
speed
and
then
for
the
first
time
noticed
the
strange
change
that
had
come
over
the
sky
up
from
the
north
a
long
wide
column
of
clouds
low
and
black
was
rushing
with
incredible
velocity
the
wind
too
had
shifted
and
suddenly
lost
its
warmth
and
seemed
to
be
gathering
strange
voices
from
the
wilderness
it
was
evident
that
a
storm
was
brewing
it
was
in
this
moment
of
surprised
inattention
that
her
brother
s
mistrust
of
orlando
s
open
vice
was
justified
without
any
ostensible
reason
he
suddenly
bounded
from
one
side
of
the
road
to
the
other
and
stella
who
sat
at
ease
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
quickly
gathering
clouds
found
herself
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
low
in
the
dust
with
one
shoulder
feeling
very
numbed
and
a
general
sense
of
dislocation
weighing
heavily
upon
her
i
have
had
an
experimental
burster
after
all
was
the
first
thought
and
then
she
attempted
to
rise
but
she
could
only
limp
very
slowly
and
painfully
orlando
cantered
out
of
sight
the
loose
reins
and
flying
stirrup
and
all
that
marks
the
demoralizing
contrast
between
a
horse
ridden
and
guided
and
one
who
is
a
lawless
runaway
prompting
him
to
flee
from
the
scene
of
his
escapade
dustiefoot
looked
after
the
defaulter
lost
in
amazement
which
presently
gave
place
to
an
indignant
bark
then
he
came
and
fawned
on
his
mistress
and
held
her
in
his
mouth
till
she
took
it
from
him
there
are
few
occasions
in
which
the
pangs
of
conscience
make
themselves
felt
more
acutely
than
after
being
rolled
in
the
dust
by
a
horse
that
one
has
been
warned
not
to
take
beyond
the
as
far
as
she
could
ascertain
stella
had
no
limbs
broken
but
both
the
right
shoulder
and
arm
felt
extremely
stiff
and
sore
and
there
was
some
twist
in
her
right
foot
which
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
walk
even
a
mile
much
less
seven
or
eight
the
only
alternative
was
to
sit
by
the
roadside
till
some
one
passed
who
could
take
her
home
and
then
arose
the
very
unwelcome
and
disturbing
thought
that
tramps
and
vagabond
sundowners
were
just
as
likely
to
pass
as
friendly
squatters
in
buggies
or
a
resident
from
nareen
or
warracootie
eager
to
show
a
kindness
to
anyone
belonging
to
lull
there
was
a
large
fallen
gum
tree
on
one
side
of
the
road
at
about
thirty
or
forty
yards
away
from
it
with
considerable
pain
stella
dragged
herself
to
this
and
sat
so
as
to
be
as
much
as
possible
protected
from
the
storm
which
would
evidently
soon
break
in
its
wrath
even
as
she
reached
this
place
of
refuge
there
was
that
curious
lull
which
foretold
a
fierce
outbreak
all
heaven
was
now
clothed
with
a
shroud
of
clouds
the
wind
which
had
quickly
risen
and
broken
into
keen
shrill
voices
seemed
for
a
moment
suspended
the
birds
had
betaken
themselves
to
the
covert
of
the
trees
and
were
as
silent
as
though
night
had
fallen
then
with
a
sudden
obscurity
of
darkness
there
was
a
great
sound
as
of
many
rushing
gathering
murmur
that
had
at
first
something
plaintive
almost
musical
as
of
many
harpers
harping
on
their
harps
but
this
was
soon
drowned
in
a
hoarse
roar
gust
after
gust
of
terrific
violence
each
one
higher
than
the
other
swept
over
the
woods
till
all
the
air
was
darkened
and
thick
with
dust
with
branches
torn
from
the
trees
with
fragments
of
blackened
grass
trees
with
withered
boughs
that
had
been
long
dead
of
old
the
spirits
of
the
tempest
were
all
thousand
jarring
voices
seemed
let
loose
at
once
rising
in
wails
and
shrieks
and
fiery
confused
sounds
as
of
battle
and
lamentation
then
a
great
flame
of
lightning
swept
the
horizon
and
peal
after
peal
of
thunder
broke
and
resounded
as
though
the
earth
were
undermined
with
cyclopean
chambers
through
which
the
deafening
crashes
hurtled
and
reverberated
endlessly
quivering
flames
swept
constantly
across
the
face
of
the
sky
as
if
the
darkened
heavens
were
being
searched
with
flaring
torches
dustiefoot
cowered
close
to
his
mistress
and
both
were
fortunately
sheltered
from
the
brunt
of
the
storm
by
the
closely
interwoven
branches
under
which
they
had
taken
shelter
every
now
and
then
sticks
and
broken
limbs
and
all
the
débris
that
floats
at
large
when
the
wind
is
blowing
with
hurricane
violence
over
great
tracts
of
thickly
wooded
country
fell
around
them
now
and
then
a
branch
was
broken
off
overhead
and
lifted
high
up
as
though
it
were
a
at
each
peal
of
thunder
the
dog
gave
a
low
growl
the
hair
round
his
neck
bristling
on
end
stella
called
him
by
name
from
time
to
time
but
a
would
have
been
lost
in
that
terrific
din
as
completely
as
a
whisper
the
touch
of
her
hand
on
his
head
however
seemed
to
reassure
him
it
was
certain
that
the
almost
human
intelligence
of
the
dog
s
eyes
as
he
alternately
fixed
them
wistfully
on
her
face
and
looked
abroad
wrathfully
when
he
gave
a
low
growl
as
if
warning
the
elements
not
to
go
too
far
gave
stella
a
sense
of
companionship
even
of
amusement
but
the
air
seemed
loaded
with
sulphureous
vapours
that
gradually
made
her
head
feel
at
once
giddy
and
very
heavy
once
or
twice
she
caught
herself
opening
her
eyes
with
the
sudden
start
of
one
who
has
dozed
at
such
times
dustiefoot
seemed
more
than
ever
on
the
alert
with
a
brisk
protecting
air
it
was
when
the
fury
of
the
storm
was
spent
that
the
thick
end
of
a
bough
which
had
been
denuded
in
its
flittings
of
all
the
lighter
branches
crashed
through
the
boughs
overhead
grazing
stella
on
the
temple
and
falling
heavily
on
poor
dustiefoot
s
left
paw
he
gave
one
low
yelping
bark
but
did
not
whine
or
moan
once
though
the
jagged
end
of
the
storm
s
missile
had
cut
and
bruised
him
badly
the
sight
of
the
blood
dripping
from
the
wounded
paw
made
stella
turn
faint
and
cold
she
could
not
spare
her
handkerchief
in
all
that
blinding
dust
but
she
had
a
fine
white
silk
one
round
her
throat
and
tearing
this
in
two
she
bound
one
half
of
it
round
the
maimed
limb
dustiefoot
lay
close
by
her
his
head
in
her
lap
and
more
than
ever
as
the
storm
subsided
stella
felt
that
she
could
not
keep
her
eyes
open
she
felt
sure
however
that
dustiefoot
would
not
let
any
vehicle
or
horseman
pass
by
without
giving
timely
notice
already
he
had
started
up
barking
clamorously
but
the
each
time
was
a
stray
bullock
which
hurried
into
a
thicker
part
of
the
woods
as
if
fearful
that
the
worst
was
yet
to
come
once
or
twice
stella
aroused
herself
with
thinking
of
the
consternation
her
absence
through
such
a
storm
and
on
a
horse
of
orlando
s
character
would
cause
at
lullaboolagana
well
at
the
worst
they
would
send
out
in
search
of
her
when
the
evening
drew
near
and
dunstan
had
seen
her
take
the
road
that
led
to
nareen
the
atmosphere
and
the
shock
of
the
fall
and
perhaps
too
the
little
blow
on
her
temple
and
the
previous
night
s
vigils
all
combined
to
bring
on
a
queer
feeling
of
stupor
she
was
not
asleep
nor
insensible
and
yet
she
felt
as
if
even
to
move
were
a
trouble
she
felt
a
slow
trickling
on
her
temple
and
thought
it
must
be
rain
a
few
large
had
fallen
as
the
storm
abated
but
nothing
more
it
was
a
little
rivulet
of
blood
which
trickled
from
the
left
temple
where
it
was
grazed
by
the
she
rested
her
head
against
a
large
smooth
bough
behind
her
and
sat
with
closed
eyes
deathly
pale
it
seemed
to
her
that
hours
passed
as
she
sat
in
this
wholly
unconscious
yet
overcome
with
an
irresistible
languor
in
reality
only
half
an
hour
had
passed
till
one
drove
up
rapidly
in
a
buggy
with
orlando
led
captive
behind
it
it
was
langdale
on
his
way
from
nareen
he
had
been
caught
in
the
storm
but
was
fortunately
in
the
stringy
bark
wood
where
the
trees
were
covered
with
vigorous
young
foliage
in
the
wicked
wood
the
ground
was
simply
littered
with
dead
wood
which
the
violence
of
the
storm
had
strewn
broadcast
like
chaff
he
saw
orlando
which
he
failed
to
recognise
as
one
of
the
lullaboolagana
horses
but
he
knew
the
daintily
embroidered
with
scarlet
a
horrible
fear
shot
through
his
heart
but
he
strove
to
believe
that
it
was
misplaced
he
could
never
quite
recall
how
he
got
through
the
wicked
wood
he
kept
glancing
from
side
to
side
at
the
great
withered
trunks
and
limbs
that
the
storm
had
felled
his
mind
filled
with
a
sickening
apprehension
of
what
the
next
turning
might
have
in
store
he
breathed
more
freely
when
the
wicked
wood
was
left
behind
a
few
minutes
afterwards
he
recognised
dustiefoot
s
barking
then
in
one
awful
moment
he
saw
his
worst
forebodings
beggared
by
the
ghastly
white
and
her
face
stained
with
blood
my
god
my
god
he
cried
with
the
intolerable
agony
of
a
strong
man
suddenly
smitten
beyond
endurance
stella
heard
the
words
distinctly
and
recognised
the
voice
she
had
a
struggling
consciousness
that
if
she
willed
it
she
could
open
her
eyes
and
speak
but
a
kind
of
hunger
fastened
on
her
to
hear
what
further
he
would
say
on
perceiving
her
thus
apparently
insensible
she
did
not
know
how
cruelly
like
death
she
face
ghastly
white
stained
with
dust
and
blood
in
a
moment
he
was
by
her
side
kneeling
by
her
his
breath
coming
in
quick
gasps
oh
my
darling
my
darling
he
cried
his
voice
failing
him
with
mortal
fear
and
then
quick
compunction
seized
on
stella
and
she
sighed
softly
so
extreme
was
his
agitation
that
for
a
moment
he
could
hardly
believe
she
was
not
mortally
hurt
but
he
found
that
her
heart
beat
with
energy
he
saw
her
eyelids
quivering
and
a
faint
tinge
of
colour
stealing
into
her
cheeks
she
recovered
consciousness
slowly
so
that
he
might
not
know
she
had
heard
those
impassioned
words
which
held
the
sweetest
music
that
had
ever
fallen
on
her
ears
also
that
he
might
not
know
the
perfidy
of
which
she
had
been
guilty
you
are
badly
hurt
i
fear
he
said
as
she
at
last
looked
up
his
voice
still
thrilled
with
the
sharp
emotions
which
had
rent
him
but
he
had
regained
his
dustiefoot
is
worse
than
i
am
she
answered
she
felt
so
absurdly
happy
that
it
was
a
surprise
to
her
to
find
her
voice
so
thin
and
faint
langdale
went
to
his
trap
and
produced
one
of
those
cases
which
are
sometimes
called
the
bushman
s
christian
when
it
is
remembered
that
such
a
case
should
contain
a
flask
of
the
best
brandy
with
a
neat
silver
top
that
can
be
used
as
a
cup
also
a
flask
of
water
and
a
pound
or
so
of
biscuits
the
term
will
not
seem
out
of
place
especially
if
it
is
further
remembered
that
those
who
make
journeys
in
the
bush
may
often
go
scores
of
miles
without
seeing
a
human
habitation
of
any
kind
but
perhaps
the
term
is
never
so
beautifully
appropriate
as
when
as
in
the
present
instance
it
is
incumbent
on
the
possessor
of
such
a
case
in
the
interests
alike
of
science
and
humanity
to
play
the
good
samaritan
now
one
two
you
are
to
drink
this
every
do
you
really
carry
medicine
about
with
you
said
stella
with
a
little
pout
as
she
sniffed
the
mixture
no
questions
if
you
please
remember
people
who
are
picked
up
wounded
and
insensible
are
cases
ah
that
isn
t
so
very
inhuman
she
said
after
gulping
down
the
dose
it
takes
the
breath
away
but
then
it
seems
to
bring
back
one
s
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
the
noble
art
of
healing
does
not
invent
such
remedies
we
can
not
say
like
the
bishop
of
noyou
that
this
recipe
came
out
of
our
own
and
who
was
the
bishop
of
noyou
a
worthy
ecclesiastic
who
used
to
say
at
the
close
of
his
sermons
my
brethren
i
took
none
of
these
truths
which
i
have
just
uttered
from
the
scriptures
or
from
the
came
out
of
the
head
of
your
bishop
that
was
not
a
pharmacop
oe
ian
drug
you
swallowed
it
was
brandy
and
dr
johnson
s
beverage
for
heroes
well
i
felt
heroic
impulses
the
moment
i
drank
less
than
a
resolve
to
mount
orlando
oh
you
unfaithful
creature
she
said
looking
reproachfully
at
the
horse
nonsense
you
must
submit
to
be
driven
home
in
my
buggy
and
i
really
must
wash
that
wound
on
your
a
wound
cried
stella
with
incredulous
amazement
yes
was
it
the
blow
of
a
stray
branch
that
threw
you
off
the
horse
or
was
it
the
fall
that
made
you
insensible
oh
i
was
she
stopped
abruptly
oh
no
you
were
not
insensible
i
suppose
and
you
have
not
been
hurt
and
orlando
did
not
run
away
in
the
meantime
this
looks
very
much
like
he
had
wetted
a
handkerchief
and
with
the
delicate
touch
of
a
trained
hand
washed
away
the
clotted
blood
then
he
perceived
that
the
wound
was
very
slight
being
in
fact
a
mere
scratch
he
assisted
her
to
rise
and
as
she
was
determined
to
ride
home
she
repressed
all
sighs
of
pain
but
he
noticed
her
sudden
paleness
and
the
contraction
of
her
lips
you
hurt
pray
let
me
drive
you
oh
no
please
claude
will
never
let
me
forget
it
if
i
am
ignominiously
wheeled
and
then
it
all
came
she
had
persisted
in
leaving
the
on
a
horse
notoriously
unsafe
except
perhaps
for
a
well
do
you
know
miss
stella
courtland
i
begin
to
think
you
are
rather
a
yes
and
i
begin
to
see
that
you
are
rather
tyrannical
will
you
send
morrison
to
see
how
many
of
my
bones
are
broken
yes
i
shall
send
him
but
i
think
it
is
a
duty
to
warn
him
of
the
sort
of
patient
he
is
likely
to
have
poor
old
boy
your
paw
is
really
rather
badly
hurt
would
you
like
a
biscuit
old
fellow
dustiefoot
ate
several
then
the
christian
companion
was
put
back
in
the
buggy
orlando
s
reins
were
mended
with
a
piece
of
twine
and
stella
rode
him
back
while
dustiefoot
sat
by
langdale
s
side
in
the
buggy
looking
quite
like
an
invalid
how
incredibly
happy
they
were
as
they
went
back
through
the
woods
exchanging
a
few
words
now
and
then
laughing
at
the
veriest
trifles
watching
orlando
s
ears
to
see
if
he
meant
to
shy
once
more
counting
the
notes
of
the
birds
that
had
found
their
voices
now
that
the
storm
was
over
they
parted
at
the
avenue
gate
of
the
home
field
i
shall
send
morrison
at
once
i
know
he
is
at
home
because
i
took
his
distant
patients
for
him
tomorrow
i
shall
probably
call
in
to
see
how
parr
are
going
happy
dog
said
stella
with
a
mischievous
laugh
is
it
only
a
day
since
we
sat
by
the
hymenosperum
tree
she
thought
as
she
rode
up
the
avenue
all
her
incipient
fears
and
forebodings
had
vanished
the
four
months
would
speed
away
almost
too
she
could
fully
realize
this
vast
happiness
which
had
come
to
her
there
was
some
duty
he
had
to
fulfil
before
he
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
she
accepted
the
fact
without
even
speculating
over
it
so
complete
and
was
her
confidence
i
could
not
love
thee
dear
so
much
loved
i
not
honour
more
were
the
words
that
rose
to
her
lips
as
she
thought
of
the
firm
which
had
so
speedily
succeeded
his
agitation
not
for
worlds
would
she
have
missed
hearing
those
passionate
words
of
endearment
and
yet
she
resolved
to
be
very
guarded
during
the
days
that
lay
between
their
help
him
in
every
way
to
keep
to
a
purpose
which
would
not
have
been
formed
without
good
reason
it
was
near
sunset
next
day
when
he
called
parr
was
making
rapid
strides
towards
recovery
dustiefoot
was
as
well
as
could
be
expected
stella
was
with
her
louise
in
the
her
injured
arm
in
a
sling
the
youngest
courtland
on
a
big
white
bearskin
at
her
feet
the
arabian
nights
on
a
little
table
near
her
behold
how
tragedies
are
made
when
common
chances
happen
to
wilful
girls
said
langdale
laughing
as
he
sat
near
her
what
have
you
been
doing
in
arabia
oh
i
drank
coffee
with
the
three
ladies
of
bagdad
and
then
i
met
aladdin
the
son
of
shamseddin
on
his
way
to
that
city
you
know
he
left
cairo
with
fifty
mules
laden
with
merchandise
was
he
overtaken
with
a
storm
did
he
have
an
experimental
burster
pray
do
not
spare
me
or
let
me
for
a
moment
forget
that
i
was
thrown
in
the
dust
like
a
foolish
sack
of
indeed
baby
dear
it
might
have
been
very
serious
said
louise
laughing
i
assure
you
it
looked
serious
enough
when
i
saw
her
said
langdale
gravely
and
as
it
is
your
arm
is
a
good
deal
hurt
he
added
in
a
lighter
tone
turning
to
stella
yes
and
i
swallowed
some
and
a
tree
hit
you
on
the
head
and
wounded
your
and
before
i
entered
the
house
yesterday
the
whole
family
met
me
in
a
one
of
those
sculptures
they
dig
up
in
nineveh
you
asking
what
could
possibly
have
induced
me
to
ride
yes
and
i
have
come
with
my
pockets
full
of
to
whip
you
till
you
repent
or
xxxv
it
was
easy
to
keep
on
neutral
ground
when
someone
else
was
by
but
next
day
when
langdale
called
all
the
rest
of
the
family
were
at
broadmead
and
stella
was
alone
on
the
western
veranda
with
a
large
basket
of
flowers
she
was
arranging
in
glasses
and
opal
dishes
containing
clear
fresh
water
from
the
creek
are
you
allowed
to
sit
up
in
this
defiant
attitude
and
do
things
langdale
asked
as
he
sat
facing
her
oh
yes
morrison
says
i
am
going
on
famously
and
that
if
no
one
scolds
me
i
may
ride
next
she
held
up
a
great
cluster
of
white
as
she
spoke
looking
at
them
sideways
in
the
clear
emerald
light
that
came
in
through
the
thick
woof
of
greenery
that
enclosed
the
veranda
i
wonder
if
anyone
ever
really
scolded
you
he
said
drawing
nearer
so
as
to
hand
her
the
flowers
she
was
arranging
in
the
glasses
with
such
cunning
effect
yes
everybody
in
dustiefoot
do
you
know
he
runs
about
as
if
nothing
had
happened
to
him
with
merely
the
prettiest
limp
in
the
are
these
white
roses
off
the
bush
close
to
the
myall
acacia
by
the
oolloolloo
he
asked
bending
over
to
count
the
number
clustered
on
one
slender
spray
yes
it
is
only
close
to
flowing
water
that
bear
such
roses
how
i
should
like
to
paint
them
or
embalm
them
in
fitting
verse
but
they
come
back
again
next
spring
in
all
their
old
witchery
it
is
only
human
lives
that
can
never
be
be
acted
over
but
unless
they
are
like
the
tags
of
old
rhymes
and
the
that
fall
and
are
evaporated
and
come
back
in
a
s
wings
or
a
plant
struggling
for
life
on
the
edge
of
a
wicked
child
you
are
laughing
at
me
to
my
face
but
whether
or
not
we
come
back
like
the
roses
or
the
creatures
you
so
much
object
to
that
have
more
legs
than
four
every
day
is
as
fresh
and
keenly
interesting
now
as
if
it
were
created
for
us
she
felt
that
they
were
getting
on
dangerous
ground
and
sought
safety
by
retreating
to
a
more
impersonal
region
in
the
persiflage
that
came
to
her
so
readily
and
yet
to
superior
beings
on
a
better
ordered
planet
i
suppose
our
lives
would
seem
little
better
than
blobs
in
a
world
heaped
up
with
tumbled
what
is
a
blob
do
you
go
out
into
the
woods
in
the
early
mornings
often
since
i
have
learned
from
you
what
an
exquisite
hour
the
dawn
is
in
then
have
you
not
noticed
transparent
little
webs
pearled
with
dew
hanging
on
bushes
and
i
have
occasionally
why
don
t
you
look
at
me
charity
when
you
speak
to
me
she
attempted
to
do
so
in
a
laughing
careless
way
but
her
glance
fell
under
his
and
her
fingers
trembled
as
she
wreathed
a
long
spray
of
native
clematis
with
tendrils
and
delicate
blossoms
round
the
slender
stem
of
a
cloisonné
vase
well
have
you
not
noticed
she
went
on
making
her
work
an
excuse
for
not
looking
at
him
how
when
something
has
brushed
against
these
webs
the
side
touched
has
curled
up
in
a
little
blister
that
is
a
thank
you
and
do
you
really
feel
like
one
when
you
are
arranging
flowers
like
these
oh
let
us
speak
in
a
broad
general
sense
she
said
laughing
but
curious
to
say
he
disregarded
the
suggestion
what
do
you
call
these
white
single
roses
they
are
the
macartney
are
they
not
lovely
with
their
golden
centres
and
wide
cups
with
leves
well
foure
paire
i
shall
always
think
of
it
as
the
stella
rose
it
is
so
starry
and
seems
to
look
abroad
with
such
fearless
inquiry
he
said
slowly
at
the
words
a
deep
damask
flush
mounted
into
her
cheeks
and
remained
there
her
deep
lustrous
eyes
were
in
truth
shining
like
twin
stars
the
she
wore
with
a
cluster
of
white
at
the
throat
threw
the
pure
tints
of
her
face
and
the
soft
brilliancy
of
her
eyes
into
clear
relief
you
think
they
have
an
inquiring
look
yes
perhaps
something
like
the
eyes
of
calves
or
the
beaks
of
hungry
how
angry
she
was
at
herself
to
find
her
face
flushing
more
hotly
her
fingers
getting
more
tremulous
her
heart
beating
more
wildly
give
me
one
of
them
she
held
out
one
to
him
and
their
hands
met
he
took
the
rose
but
did
not
release
her
hand
were
you
quite
unconscious
when
i
reached
you
yesterday
he
said
in
a
low
voice
but
she
could
not
speak
her
reply
was
a
long
shuddering
sigh
you
know
my
secret
and
you
are
not
angry
stella
his
voice
was
very
agitated
and
as
for
her
she
seemed
to
be
enveloped
in
a
throbbing
haze
through
which
she
could
not
clearly
see
nor
hear
tell
me
my
own
that
you
are
not
offended
he
said
drawing
nearer
to
her
no
i
am
not
offended
she
said
at
last
her
voice
lower
than
a
whisper
and
do
you
you
can
not
i
love
you
with
my
whole
heart
and
soul
as
a
man
can
love
but
once
in
his
life
a
fantail
began
suddenly
to
sing
near
them
as
if
its
heart
would
break
with
selfsame
bird
that
trilled
its
golden
carol
above
the
when
he
came
back
in
the
four
months
later
on
what
strange
confusion
of
time
you
must
not
say
more
till
you
return
she
said
looking
up
at
him
vainly
trying
to
smile
the
full
knowledge
that
he
loved
her
filled
her
with
joy
so
keen
that
it
bordered
on
pain
but
stella
i
must
say
more
i
must
hear
you
tell
me
that
you
love
me
just
a
little
say
it
anselm
i
love
you
a
little
would
not
be
own
sweet
not
trifle
with
yes
it
would
be
untrue
for
i
love
you
was
a
pause
in
which
he
could
not
breathe
till
the
words
came
with
a
great
thrill
of
more
than
i
can
he
knelt
down
by
her
side
and
folded
her
in
his
arms
their
lips
met
in
a
long
long
kiss
what
a
strange
memorable
hour
followed
it
was
almost
unreal
in
its
tumultuous
happiness
it
was
to
both
the
great
sacrament
of
it
giving
it
fulness
and
meaning
seeming
to
lift
it
for
evermore
above
the
meanness
of
chance
and
accident
and
disaster
giving
them
a
heavenly
anchorage
from
all
peril
and
storm
and
now
you
must
say
no
more
said
stella
at
last
smiling
through
her
happy
tears
and
there
is
to
be
no
solemn
revelation
to
anyone
it
is
our
secret
till
you
write
from
england
as
you
purposed
at
ah
but
that
was
when
i
thought
i
was
stoic
enough
to
keep
to
my
now
it
must
be
the
same
anselm
she
said
quickly
oh
do
you
not
understand
how
frightfully
tiresome
it
would
be
to
have
anyone
else
talking
over
this
precious
secret
before
we
have
realized
it
ourselves
in
four
little
months
i
shall
have
got
used
to
the
thought
the
same
reason
exists
now
that
existed
it
not
yes
my
own
he
replied
a
shadow
falling
on
his
face
but
now
i
think
you
ought
to
know
no
anselm
let
it
be
as
though
you
had
said
no
more
we
need
make
no
promises
let
what
was
your
wish
in
this
be
my
law
till
you
return
let
us
be
friends
a
little
longer
oh
it
has
been
so
dear
and
good
a
bond
can
any
other
be
better
you
little
sceptic
you
have
sat
too
long
in
the
scorner
s
chair
people
have
often
told
you
their
little
stories
stella
i
also
have
one
to
tell
you
but
as
you
wish
it
let
it
be
when
i
yes
evening
when
we
begin
to
yawn
at
each
very
well
we
have
worn
every
subject
and
we
have
learned
to
say
not
at
all
my
dear
with
tightening
when
the
honeymoon
is
quite
and
the
first
quarrel
an
old
and
poor
little
cupid
has
been
sent
to
weed
and
you
wonder
why
you
used
to
call
me
and
life
has
turned
into
a
now
we
must
lay
down
rules
you
must
not
take
my
words
without
leave
you
did
not
know
that
was
in
the
english
language
till
i
used
it
say
dear
stella
dearest
beloved
stella
please
may
i
say
blob
oh
you
artful
captivating
rogue
tell
me
stella
how
do
you
manage
to
be
such
a
wonderful
darling
just
because
i
want
you
to
be
in
love
with
so
much
that
you
don
t
know
whether
you
are
on
your
heels
or
your
and
then
oh
then
you
must
keep
an
eye
on
cupid
at
his
stella
my
belovedest
don
t
encourage
yourself
to
be
cruel
it
is
a
taste
that
grows
on
people
like
eating
opium
and
stealing
that
reminds
me
shouldn
t
i
ask
you
how
many
of
the
commandments
you
have
kept
if
any
certainly
not
it
is
the
most
dangerous
habit
a
woman
can
contract
that
of
asking
questions
more
especially
when
she
is
going
to
be
oh
how
boldly
and
brazenly
you
pronounce
the
word
how
glad
i
am
that
it
can
not
be
for
some
time
not
so
very
long
thank
god
let
me
count
on
your
oh
please
she
said
suddenly
drawing
her
hand
away
but
why
superstition
ah
have
those
beloved
fingers
of
you
are
mine
you
know
you
are
they
been
counted
before
it
is
the
most
dangerous
habit
a
man
can
contract
that
of
asking
questions
more
especially
when
he
is
going
to
be
you
have
said
it
oh
you
bold
child
how
brazenly
you
repeated
the
word
but
well
once
upon
a
time
as
you
know
already
i
did
think
of
marrying
but
i
never
loved
and
i
stella
my
ah
that
is
part
of
your
story
of
course
i
know
i
have
read
so
many
plays
and
then
there
is
tom
and
people
how
many
sonnets
did
you
write
to
eyebrows
before
you
were
eighteen
let
us
say
would
you
like
me
to
count
no
after
all
you
couldn
t
tell
what
a
darling
i
am
if
you
had
not
found
how
foolish
it
was
to
love
anyone
stella
will
you
be
a
good
loving
child
kiss
me
once
of
your
own
free
oh
time
will
you
really
after
that
and
after
on
and
on
can
it
ever
be
a
tale
too
often
told
never
never
but
what
has
become
of
my
rose
give
me
another
one
let
it
be
a
stella
rose
what
stupid
people
have
the
naming
of
flowers
oh
yes
and
of
most
things
if
only
lovers
were
among
the
convocations
that
decide
saintship
how
easily
the
ultimate
distinction
of
the
church
would
be
obtained
but
the
truest
saints
never
get
canonized
ora
pro
nobis
why
that
stifled
sigh
my
little
heretic
may
i
not
sigh
any
more
when
i
wish
yes
while
i
am
away
oh
i
think
i
must
set
off
so
that
i
may
sigh
so
that
i
may
return
quickly
ah
stella
darling
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
so
long
and
now
i
have
found
have
found
you
in
spite
of
everything
they
fell
into
the
sweet
endless
repetitions
of
lovers
and
gay
by
turns
the
sun
was
setting
before
langdale
could
tear
himself
away
and
then
before
he
rode
off
stella
walked
with
him
to
the
bridge
and
there
they
lingered
till
a
great
white
star
glowed
in
the
rose
twilight
of
the
west
which
spread
far
up
almost
to
the
zenith
of
the
sky
this
great
roseate
wave
of
colour
was
a
beautiful
phenomenon
of
the
season
and
increased
in
brilliancy
as
the
summer
drew
near
perhaps
it
is
out
of
which
new
worlds
are
to
be
fashioned
said
stella
are
you
sorry
for
them
liebe
no
perhaps
after
long
ages
there
will
be
people
in
them
who
love
each
other
as
we
that
will
make
up
for
a
proud
smile
stole
over
his
face
as
he
listened
are
you
mocking
or
in
earnest
herzblättchen
in
deadly
earnest
i
foresee
i
shall
be
fearfully
serious
no
no
you
must
not
be
a
whit
would
be
a
schism
i
could
not
bear
stella
may
i
give
you
an
old
keepsake
do
you
love
it
very
much
yes
and
i
have
worn
it
for
twelve
then
you
he
detached
a
small
gold
ring
from
his
it
is
a
motto
ring
that
was
left
by
an
old
relative
to
my
favourite
sister
margaret
who
gave
it
to
me
before
her
ah
she
died
yes
at
eighteen
a
spirit
beautiful
and
swift
do
you
know
liebe
you
reminded
me
of
her
the
first
night
we
oftentimes
stella
took
the
ring
and
kissed
it
gently
i
shall
wear
it
next
my
heart
she
said
there
is
a
motto
on
the
amore
yes
amore
e
l
cor
gentil
sono
una
cosa
love
and
a
noble
heart
are
one
and
the
same
it
is
out
of
the
vita
nuova
ah
the
great
master
from
first
to
last
he
speaks
more
nobly
of
love
than
any
other
of
the
sons
of
shall
we
read
him
together
next
spring
liebe
you
know
we
shall
be
old
married
people
by
that
time
are
you
cold
stella
you
seem
to
no
not
cold
when
you
spoke
of
next
spring
someone
must
have
walked
over
the
earth
in
which
my
grave
is
to
oh
blättchen
what
a
weird
idea
you
should
not
speak
of
such
a
yes
we
shall
read
dante
together
but
won
t
that
be
reversing
the
usual
order
of
married
be
first
in
the
inferno
and
then
go
on
to
paradise
they
laughed
softly
they
were
so
far
removed
from
the
sagging
prose
the
dulness
the
satiety
of
the
usual
order
of
the
hour
was
one
of
the
charmed
fairies
which
come
once
or
twice
in
the
years
of
man
s
earthly
in
both
hands
a
cup
filled
to
the
brim
with
life
s
costliest
wine
the
soft
in
the
western
heaven
thrilled
through
the
transparent
atmosphere
the
oolloolloo
babbled
merrily
on
its
way
its
course
as
yet
unstayed
by
the
fiery
ardours
of
the
approaching
summer
a
solitary
curlew
called
in
the
distance
but
near
at
hand
the
liquid
songs
of
the
little
fell
thick
and
fast
like
swift
melodious
raindrops
they
turned
at
last
towards
the
house
with
lingering
footsteps
how
can
we
meet
after
this
like
mere
friends
liebe
said
langdale
as
they
paused
at
the
end
of
the
little
bridge
it
is
very
good
and
generous
of
you
only
to
think
of
what
i
could
have
wished
i
would
like
to
see
the
sort
of
being
that
represents
me
in
your
imagination
anselm
oh
please
don
t
make
a
of
me
for
you
will
be
most
dreadfully
disappointed
remember
that
we
propose
to
face
the
ordeal
of
i
wish
to
heaven
the
ordeal
were
to
you
must
not
am
going
to
make
a
well
your
father
confessor
is
waiting
to
hear
it
and
if
possible
to
grant
father
confessor
oh
anselm
if
you
could
see
your
own
eyes
just
now
you
wouldn
t
call
yourself
such
names
but
don
t
try
to
look
different
you
are
one
of
the
few
people
who
can
be
happy
without
looking
foolish
i
am
quite
in
earnest
when
people
have
the
wrong
sort
of
profile
they
pay
a
very
heavy
penalty
for
being
glad
you
know
when
you
cried
out
on
first
seeing
heard
you
i
was
not
insensible
i
could
have
moved
and
opened
my
least
i
am
sure
i
i
didn
t
even
you
cruel
child
why
didn
t
you
wanted
to
hear
you
say
my
darling
i
was
at
once
bold
and
this
is
too
sweet
a
crime
to
be
lightly
forgiven
said
langdale
gravely
oh
what
infatuation
well
don
t
you
see
it
was
like
waylaying
you
out
of
your
declaration
i
ought
to
be
sorry
but
i
can
not
for
we
would
have
lost
this
day
and
no
other
could
be
quite
so
perfect
only
let
your
reason
hold
good
after
all
it
concerns
only
us
two
really
and
do
you
not
know
how
i
love
to
fold
this
secret
in
my
heart
from
everyone
in
the
world
but
you
for
a
little
time
i
could
not
bear
to
have
it
profaned
all
at
once
so
many
women
chatter
about
such
things
in
a
common
callous
way
there
is
helen
s
elder
perfect
image
of
gossips
away
perpetually
her
favourite
subject
is
engagements
you
may
smile
but
i
am
quite
serious
she
asks
questions
until
you
feel
that
you
are
lying
about
in
fragments
then
she
puts
you
together
and
begins
very
well
sweet
charity
let
it
be
your
penance
to
have
your
own
way
in
and
now
while
we
walk
back
to
the
house
you
can
practise
talking
and
looking
like
a
mere
in
that
case
when
i
speak
to
you
you
must
look
look
away
that
is
what
people
in
love
do
in
a
comedy
why
the
very
magpies
would
point
us
out
as
but
what
am
i
to
do
when
you
look
at
me
with
those
eyes
that
is
not
the
way
to
practise
devise
anecdotes
about
the
weather
and
try
to
be
reasonable
once
more
for
you
have
suddenly
forsworn
the
there
is
not
the
same
call
for
it
you
seem
to
have
left
off
railing
against
nature
and
providence
and
the
treacheries
of
life
remember
what
you
said
about
the
new
world
stella
watched
him
ride
away
turning
at
intervals
to
look
at
her
till
he
was
out
of
sight
and
her
eyes
became
suddenly
dim
with
the
only
eight
more
days
before
we
must
part
xxxvi
yes
these
eight
lengthening
golden
spring
days
swept
on
with
cruel
swiftness
and
yet
they
held
so
much
the
hours
in
which
the
heart
is
most
deeply
touched
have
something
of
the
quality
of
eternity
they
stretch
backward
and
forward
allying
themselves
with
all
that
is
deepest
and
most
enduring
in
human
experience
stella
s
was
one
of
those
complex
yet
essentially
feminine
natures
which
can
only
be
gradually
kindled
with
love
but
when
it
comes
to
full
being
it
is
a
passion
which
transforms
all
life
in
place
of
discord
there
is
harmony
that
before
lay
mute
and
unsuspected
like
hassan
s
gold
covered
over
by
common
wood
the
friendship
which
had
ripened
into
the
perfect
blossom
of
love
had
been
a
very
real
one
social
intercourse
is
for
the
most
part
a
pitifully
shabby
concern
in
which
the
ashes
of
mere
existence
smother
aspiration
the
quick
play
of
fancy
and
the
sympathetic
flow
of
thoughts
that
range
beyond
merely
egotistical
aims
an
affair
in
which
men
and
women
largely
bear
themselves
as
though
they
were
automata
moved
only
by
the
wheels
of
custom
taking
thought
mainly
for
the
things
that
perish
with
the
using
but
fellowship
with
the
kind
of
vitality
which
wakens
deeper
chords
of
thought
and
feeling
is
as
the
salt
of
life
there
were
moments
at
first
in
which
stella
could
have
found
it
in
her
heart
to
be
sorry
that
her
friend
had
degenerated
into
a
but
if
he
had
not
how
unhappy
she
would
have
been
and
how
much
she
would
have
lost
even
the
old
faith
she
had
given
up
seemed
in
some
way
gradually
flowing
back
when
she
prayed
she
no
longer
lost
herself
in
weary
conjectures
as
to
its
futility
doubting
that
her
weak
pitiful
words
could
reach
the
great
omniscience
whose
thought
of
order
was
the
fixed
law
of
all
the
starry
hosts
doubting
and
wondering
till
she
seemed
to
be
obliterated
in
a
chaotic
universe
where
nothing
seemed
certain
but
uncertainty
and
these
long
beautiful
days
passed
without
any
of
the
jar
and
fuss
and
congratulation
that
would
have
robbed
them
of
their
serenity
if
the
sweet
notion
of
mere
friendship
had
been
abandoned
please
tell
us
about
one
of
your
hospital
people
stella
would
say
as
she
often
said
before
in
the
presence
of
her
brothers
or
their
wives
and
she
would
sit
sewing
and
listening
hardly
raising
her
eyes
there
were
so
many
people
she
had
learned
to
know
in
this
old
scotch
charwoman
who
never
read
fiction
because
she
said
it
was
mostly
taken
up
by
things
that
did
not
signify
for
this
life
or
that
which
is
to
come
the
little
lame
boy
who
told
the
sister
of
charity
he
did
not
believe
god
heard
people
about
legs
the
costermonger
who
had
been
run
over
and
whose
wife
candidly
explained
that
the
lord
had
made
him
naterally
so
silly
one
could
not
tell
oftentimes
whether
he
was
drunk
or
sober
and
when
they
were
alone
after
one
of
these
episodes
had
been
talked
over
stella
would
say
with
unaltered
demureness
dr
langdale
do
not
go
into
partnership
with
your
cousin
in
the
why
not
miss
stella
he
would
say
with
responding
gravity
because
you
like
the
poor
so
much
and
her
voice
with
a
quick
change
of
we
shall
have
enough
money
and
medicine
has
the
trick
of
turning
into
a
trade
when
it
makes
a
big
the
we
had
a
magical
sound
to
langdale
then
sometimes
they
would
talk
of
the
work
on
which
he
had
been
engaged
at
first
he
persisted
he
would
tell
her
nothing
about
it
till
his
return
you
have
woven
so
many
brilliant
fancies
about
it
charity
and
the
reality
is
such
homespun
then
she
found
he
had
been
engaged
on
a
dual
a
treatise
on
some
aspects
of
hypnotism
the
other
on
the
conditions
of
factory
labour
on
this
she
expounded
a
brilliant
plan
by
which
they
might
be
unified
and
so
produce
a
novel
with
a
solid
realistic
background
relieved
by
incidents
of
ideal
romance
in
which
suggestion
should
play
the
part
of
the
genii
never
were
so
many
plots
thrown
away
on
a
material
mind
before
laughed
langdale
before
these
charmed
days
were
over
he
could
not
forbear
confiding
to
hector
courtland
that
his
purpose
in
returning
so
speedily
to
australia
was
to
visit
fairacre
on
which
courtland
heartily
wished
him
good
luck
and
prophesied
that
he
had
a
good
show
but
said
not
a
word
to
stella
he
told
his
wife
however
and
she
was
delighted
but
a
little
provoked
at
what
she
thought
was
some
sort
of
caprice
on
stella
s
part
she
assumed
that
langdale
had
put
his
fortune
to
the
touch
and
that
the
girl
was
too
wayward
or
too
much
in
love
with
her
dearly
cherished
be
at
once
entirely
guided
by
her
heart
she
will
be
sorry
when
he
is
gone
and
it
serves
her
right
she
said
a
little
vindictively
oh
stella
may
as
well
have
a
good
long
think
over
it
she
is
just
the
sort
of
girl
that
might
be
happier
single
all
her
life
returned
her
brother
meditatively
he
fully
adopted
his
wife
s
opinion
without
however
ascribing
his
sister
s
supposed
action
to
caprice
oh
you
think
stella
means
all
those
wicked
little
speeches
she
makes
about
marriage
said
the
wife
well
she
means
some
of
them
or
they
would
not
occur
to
her
returned
hector
with
a
touch
of
that
fine
discrimination
which
often
characterizes
reticent
natures
courtland
s
resentment
was
not
of
a
serious
nature
and
indeed
chiefly
took
the
form
of
contriving
to
give
the
friends
that
solitude
which
so
often
leads
to
a
change
of
programme
and
even
of
life
thus
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
preceding
stella
s
departure
the
two
after
strolling
for
some
little
time
with
courtland
and
claude
among
the
by
the
oolloolloo
found
themselves
left
alone
heartlessly
deserted
by
their
companions
it
was
the
fourteenth
of
september
the
season
was
dry
and
warm
and
already
the
time
of
roses
had
begun
at
lullaboolagana
some
were
out
very
early
some
were
half
open
some
just
in
bud
but
all
of
them
were
very
lovely
the
white
and
pale
cream
banksias
were
out
in
clustering
festoons
against
walls
and
espaliers
there
were
tall
standard
of
fortune
s
yellow
cloth
of
gold
white
and
pink
moss
the
safrano
and
the
generous
old
were
loaded
with
opening
roses
the
ophiric
with
its
shining
unserrated
leaves
and
roses
of
pale
flame
the
delicate
yellow
of
the
narcisse
the
pure
pink
of
the
princesse
de
hazel
were
among
those
that
were
opening
earlier
the
solfataro
too
with
its
large
buds
pale
when
they
first
unclose
but
later
white
as
the
breast
of
a
la
brillante
with
its
fiery
buds
the
gloire
de
dijon
in
early
were
slipping
their
sheaths
and
coyly
uncurling
their
outer
petals
dry
as
the
season
might
be
the
roses
never
lacked
for
water
in
the
lullaboolagana
home
field
they
were
its
great
joy
of
its
mistress
and
the
pride
of
dunstan
s
heart
there
were
stations
not
twenty
miles
away
in
which
roses
paled
and
dwindled
like
rare
exotics
under
an
inclement
sky
but
here
on
the
banks
of
the
little
oolloolloo
and
all
within
the
spacious
field
they
bloomed
early
and
late
how
do
you
manage
it
dunstan
visitors
used
to
say
in
wondering
admiration
and
the
old
man
who
was
careful
always
to
conceal
his
pride
would
reply
oh
it
s
the
sile
as
does
sile
and
the
creek
and
the
underground
tank
and
the
tubing
you
see
if
i
say
to
the
mistress
i
wants
this
or
the
t
other
must
be
done
why
there
tis
you
know
course
i
don
t
say
that
i
m
a
born
jackass
and
don
t
know
that
one
rose
wants
to
be
treated
one
way
and
another
quite
gardening
was
a
topic
on
which
dunstan
was
never
unwilling
to
enlarge
when
stella
spoke
to
him
as
he
worked
in
the
home
field
he
did
so
on
this
afternoon
when
she
stood
lost
in
admiration
of
a
young
murray
wattle
whose
great
golden
racemes
drooping
one
over
the
other
all
the
folds
of
the
wide
woolly
tufts
fully
open
formed
a
sight
of
exceeding
joy
yes
tis
purty
fair
he
said
giving
it
a
sidelong
look
and
yet
if
i
hadn
t
it
a
bit
last
season
and
given
it
more
water
twould
have
give
up
the
ghost
a
man
may
put
as
much
work
inter
ground
as
would
make
trees
and
flowers
spring
up
like
shiverin
grass
and
he
may
get
naught
but
barrenness
if
so
be
his
work
isn
t
what
it
should
be
tis
for
all
the
world
like
a
man
going
out
shootin
miss
stelly
he
may
fire
away
till
he
s
black
in
the
face
and
yet
not
bring
home
a
crow
s
bill
wilton
who
s
so
fond
of
carryin
a
the
lord
only
knows
if
it
s
not
to
show
how
much
powder
and
shot
may
be
wasted
and
no
harm
to
any
creature
with
a
wing
though
i
ve
known
him
to
graze
the
of
a
bullock
pretty
bad
twas
after
that
i
was
out
with
him
once
at
swamp
desolation
and
he
kep
on
blazing
away
in
such
a
permiscous
way
i
said
to
him
at
larst
sez
i
look
here
bill
if
you
re
to
go
on
firing
like
that
i
must
go
into
the
swamp
and
sit
down
among
the
wild
ducks
tis
the
only
spot
where
i
ll
be
sure
of
a
whole
skin
stella
who
had
stayed
behind
her
companions
to
talk
to
dunstan
was
laughing
merrily
over
this
incisive
illustration
when
langdale
came
back
alone
and
then
the
two
wandered
by
the
oolloolloo
whose
silvery
whispering
was
growing
fainter
day
by
day
teach
me
before
we
part
ever
belovedest
how
i
am
to
live
so
long
without
seeing
you
or
hearing
you
laugh
said
langdale
as
they
stood
to
watch
the
ripple
of
the
wind
among
the
tender
leaflets
of
a
don
t
sigh
stella
see
what
a
perfect
has
been
sent
us
heaven
not
nature
anselm
a
little
while
ago
i
kept
wondering
what
they
could
grow
in
heaven
lovelier
than
a
murray
wattle
and
and
now
look
up
there
where
tiny
flakes
of
cloud
leaflets
seem
to
be
floating
they
are
really
young
angels
who
are
waiting
for
an
excuse
to
come
do
they
despair
of
seeing
people
as
happy
up
there
as
here
but
tell
them
they
will
hear
your
slightest
they
want
to
see
perfect
happiness
to
come
all
the
way
down
next
spring
do
you
remember
what
brave
old
homer
puts
in
the
mouth
of
ulysses
when
he
wishes
that
nausicaa
may
be
happily
married
nothing
is
better
or
more
beautiful
than
when
a
man
and
a
woman
inhabit
a
house
being
one
in
heart
we
must
not
have
too
many
possessions
anselm
people
get
so
fearfully
swallowed
up
in
furniture
it
would
be
adorable
to
start
life
like
hassan
the
with
a
cruse
of
water
and
a
plume
of
curled
you
often
gibe
liebstes
herz
at
the
commonplace
as
though
it
were
a
penal
settlement
but
i
confess
i
have
often
seen
a
return
to
his
home
at
night
with
feelings
akin
to
dear
darling
you
have
often
been
lonely
and
i
wasn
t
there
to
comfort
you
but
after
tell
me
stella
when
i
return
home
will
you
hasten
to
meet
me
walking
buoyantly
on
the
of
your
feet
like
a
figure
in
antique
sculpture
as
you
walked
among
the
just
now
come
and
sit
in
this
charming
little
one
mass
of
jasmine
and
why
stella
my
god
you
are
crying
anselm
how
foolish
of
you
to
be
alarmed
because
i
shed
a
few
tears
did
you
think
i
never
never
cried
i
believe
cuthbert
is
quite
pleased
when
he
sees
me
reduced
to
tears
not
that
he
has
witnessed
me
often
in
that
plight
you
see
we
were
so
much
together
and
as
boys
do
not
cry
i
got
quite
out
of
the
but
my
child
all
this
does
not
explain
why
you
weep
now
herzblättchen
i
can
not
bear
to
see
you
anything
but
smilingly
it
is
because
we
are
too
happy
anselm
all
day
it
comes
over
me
afresh
every
now
and
then
like
a
great
wave
of
incredible
gladness
sometimes
i
can
not
sleep
thinking
it
is
all
too
like
a
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
before
i
open
my
eyes
my
heart
begins
to
beat
wildly
for
bird
that
sings
has
a
lilt
in
its
song
to
which
i
could
dance
and
then
in
the
middle
of
it
all
comes
a
sudden
shiver
of
fear
ah
there
are
such
frightful
catastrophes
in
life
i
think
of
my
old
friend
stanhope
cut
off
in
a
few
days
it
all
came
up
so
vividly
last
and
the
tears
are
in
your
eyes
still
you
fearless
little
australian
with
strong
roots
of
the
keltic
melancholy
and
superstition
lying
deep
under
all
get
a
pâquerette
and
pluck
the
leaves
to
see
how
i
worship
you
daisy
petals
are
truer
than
he
drew
her
close
within
his
arms
here
she
was
safe
here
the
billows
of
life
s
bitter
waters
could
not
reach
or
affright
her
the
jasmine
was
by
a
tall
white
poplar
whose
young
leaves
with
fair
silver
lining
quivered
on
the
slender
stalks
with
as
swift
a
motion
as
on
the
day
that
the
old
greek
poet
compared
the
maidens
to
them
who
spun
late
and
early
in
the
household
of
king
alcinous
through
the
roof
of
leaves
and
blossoms
overhead
and
the
poplar
limbs
with
their
mist
of
tender
leaves
the
blue
crystalline
dome
of
the
sky
could
be
seen
stretching
above
all
like
a
great
benign
smile
how
peaceful
it
all
was
how
much
more
reasonable
to
believe
the
waking
assurances
of
earth
and
sky
than
the
vague
presentiments
of
a
sleeping
girl
o
gentle
wind
that
bloweth
south
from
where
my
love
repaireth
convey
a
kiss
from
his
dear
mouth
and
tell
me
how
he
she
chanted
the
words
with
the
old
glad
light
in
her
eyes
and
laid
solemn
charges
on
him
to
turn
towards
australia
night
and
morning
and
waft
her
greetings
they
did
not
say
farewell
that
evening
hector
courtland
was
to
accompany
his
sister
part
of
the
way
to
melbourne
and
was
to
take
her
by
way
of
the
peeloo
plain
on
the
borders
of
which
his
friend
dene
lived
and
langdale
proposed
to
pay
a
visit
at
the
same
time
but
many
farewells
had
to
be
spoken
nevertheless
and
do
what
she
would
the
feeling
lay
heavy
at
stella
s
heart
that
in
leaving
lullaboolagana
the
dearest
tenderest
chapter
in
the
book
of
her
history
was
over
here
life
s
dearest
mount
of
vision
had
been
scaled
its
sweetest
idyll
had
been
told
poor
old
mick
wept
effusively
when
she
bade
him
dunstan
made
it
very
clear
that
it
was
her
duty
to
come
back
to
lullaboolagana
early
next
spring
if
not
sooner
why
miss
stelly
the
place
was
made
for
you
i
may
say
and
what
will
become
of
the
vagabonds
that
get
their
legs
broke
i
dunno
the
crow
has
took
to
no
one
but
yourself
and
that
poor
female
as
went
away
with
her
brother
last
week
whole
and
well
and
the
three
horses
a
kickin
up
their
legs
as
if
they
never
knew
what
it
was
to
be
skelingtons
and
even
that
blasphemin
cockie
had
forgotten
some
of
his
worst
dunstan
lost
himself
in
enumerating
the
caravan
procession
that
had
so
deeply
impressed
him
the
next
afternoon
stella
and
her
brother
reached
peeloo
station
where
they
were
to
stay
the
night
langdale
came
near
sundown
after
paying
some
professional
visits
for
morrison
by
the
way
there
was
but
a
meagre
garden
at
this
station
though
it
was
a
wealthy
one
like
most
in
the
district
the
house
too
had
a
curiously
makeshift
appearance
the
fact
was
that
the
family
from
year
to
year
proposed
residing
in
the
vicinity
of
melbourne
near
sunset
the
host
proposed
an
evening
ride
to
all
who
cared
to
go
over
the
great
peeloo
plain
which
stretched
for
over
sixty
miles
westward
there
was
an
artesian
well
ten
miles
off
on
the
plain
of
weeping
myalls
he
wished
to
show
courtland
whom
the
gods
love
ride
across
a
great
australian
plain
in
the
evening
said
stella
and
langdale
of
course
was
instantly
converted
to
the
same
opinion
so
the
four
set
off
westward
when
the
sun
was
low
on
the
horizon
there
were
heat
clouds
piled
up
in
an
unmoving
bank
through
which
the
sun
burned
as
it
sank
like
a
smouldering
fire
that
the
wind
has
fanned
till
the
coals
kindle
into
red
heat
and
the
flames
break
out
eating
their
way
through
the
fuel
for
a
moment
before
setting
the
sun
stood
all
undimmed
on
the
level
horizon
like
a
great
fiery
ball
and
then
dropped
suddenly
out
of
sight
leaving
a
deep
soft
glow
which
reached
high
up
in
the
heavens
and
so
remained
for
hours
this
beautiful
unusual
appearance
was
more
vivid
that
evening
than
it
had
ever
been
before
the
riders
followed
no
road
but
took
their
way
across
the
plain
still
clothed
with
the
luxuriant
winter
grass
which
here
and
there
was
beginning
to
be
touched
with
the
heat
languor
that
a
few
weeks
later
would
turn
the
verdure
into
sapless
flax
but
as
yet
the
herbage
was
so
close
and
rich
that
the
of
the
horses
scarcely
awoke
an
echo
the
few
sounds
that
were
borne
with
startling
distinctness
through
the
sonorous
air
died
away
the
shrill
scream
of
a
black
cockatoo
in
the
depths
of
a
weeping
myall
the
twitter
of
a
little
emu
wren
bounding
through
the
grass
the
loud
calls
of
the
in
a
flowering
acacia
the
hysterical
chorus
of
laughing
jackasses
in
the
wooded
bend
of
a
watercourse
densely
lined
with
the
sudden
caw
of
a
solitary
crow
in
a
all
became
silent
one
by
one
now
and
then
a
red
kangaroo
with
his
beautiful
ruddy
tints
and
faint
flush
of
on
the
or
a
doe
clad
in
delicate
steely
blue
bounded
near
them
as
they
passed
they
flew
over
the
great
smooth
plain
while
the
spring
wind
vivifying
as
a
blew
in
their
faces
at
times
they
came
to
a
stretch
of
kangaroo
grass
tall
and
rustling
swayed
by
the
wind
that
came
now
and
then
running
up
in
little
fitful
gusts
till
the
faint
billows
formed
an
exact
image
of
the
waves
seen
in
in
placid
summer
weather
the
earth
and
sky
equally
had
an
unfamiliar
boundlessness
that
at
first
lay
like
a
weight
on
the
spirit
and
yet
gradually
soothed
it
as
the
imagination
gathered
impulse
and
repose
from
the
sad
magnificent
horizons
unbroken
by
wood
or
hill
or
the
gleam
of
water
at
rare
intervals
the
marvellous
uniformity
was
heightened
rather
than
interrupted
by
the
course
of
a
creek
whose
abrupt
banks
were
marked
by
a
wavering
line
of
or
weeping
myall
and
sometimes
dense
undergrowth
the
light
of
day
and
the
brilliant
blue
of
the
sky
were
replaced
by
the
dreamy
paleness
which
falls
on
the
world
when
the
heavens
are
cloudless
yet
hold
the
stars
for
some
time
out
of
sight
and
the
earth
lies
stretched
below
without
limit
and
without
shadow
there
was
no
cold
look
in
the
sky
no
bleakness
on
the
earth
it
was
noble
in
its
vast
breadth
its
virgin
promise
of
to
be
the
of
a
race
strong
free
and
generous
careful
not
only
for
the
things
that
advance
man
s
material
prosperity
but
caring
infinitely
as
well
for
all
that
touches
the
human
spirit
with
quick
recognition
of
its
immortal
kinships
it
is
like
no
other
scene
i
have
ever
looked
at
said
langdale
at
length
breaking
the
silence
don
t
you
feel
you
will
remember
it
all
to
your
dying
day
asked
stella
softly
yes
perhaps
when
we
die
we
shall
remember
it
better
than
ever
it
is
like
a
picture
of
the
old
classic
underworld
with
its
pale
light
and
its
wide
homeless
oh
if
it
would
only
last
for
world
flooded
in
mysterious
light
the
horses
never
tired
the
horizon
never
visible
why
are
you
smiling
i
would
not
wish
it
to
go
on
for
ever
i
have
an
imagination
that
would
soon
pine
for
a
local
blättchen
waiting
for
me
inside
but
how
often
we
shall
recall
this
ride
till
we
meet
again
there
were
cadenced
cries
far
overhead
as
if
among
the
stars
which
began
to
swim
into
sight
all
over
the
firmament
and
looking
upward
a
long
line
of
great
birds
with
dusky
wings
wide
spread
became
visible
they
are
swans
going
to
their
by
some
swamp
said
stella
how
plaintive
and
musical
their
notes
are
don
t
they
make
you
understand
what
someone
meant
when
he
said
that
virtuous
melodies
teach
virtue
and
what
virtue
could
they
teach
herzblättchen
that
she
does
not
possess
handfuls
try
to
believe
this
in
time
gentleness
resignation
hope
did
you
not
tell
me
yourself
some
time
ago
that
i
was
curiously
lacking
in
hope
i
always
knew
that
a
friend
was
more
faithful
than
a
lover
but
liebe
i
am
both
only
the
more
i
know
you
the
less
i
could
bear
to
have
you
that
is
what
i
am
always
promising
when
my
happiness
makes
me
afraid
to
be
different
i
take
refuge
in
the
thought
that
i
am
going
to
be
so
useful
and
make
some
lives
happier
that
without
us
might
be
intolerably
hard
to
make
our
future
home
a
little
radiant
centre
anselm
i
had
rather
be
a
cat
and
mew
at
the
moon
than
be
and
wrapped
up
in
my
own
prosperity
like
a
langdale
laughed
softly
at
this
quick
vehemence
of
speech
but
stella
how
little
danger
there
is
of
that
do
you
want
to
make
me
believe
that
you
have
not
always
been
helpful
and
of
sympathy
and
tenderness
and
quick
insight
ready
always
ah
but
you
don
t
know
how
indifferent
in
ready
at
any
moment
to
believe
that
after
all
it
does
not
much
matter
you
do
not
know
this
vagrancy
of
temperament
you
are
protected
by
your
nationalities
and
your
love
of
work
that
gives
you
an
ideal
of
duty
apart
from
whim
and
sudden
changes
of
i
always
knew
that
a
friend
was
more
faithful
than
a
don
t
laugh
at
me
anselm
we
shall
recall
this
ride
so
often
as
you
have
said
when
the
days
are
too
people
are
wearisome
and
that
is
one
of
the
great
qualities
of
our
race
langdale
laughed
again
and
took
off
his
hat
in
acknowledgment
of
this
wide
compliment
forgive
me
liebe
he
said
recovering
his
gravity
but
this
air
seems
to
get
into
one
s
head
like
champagne
but
i
promise
not
to
interrupt
well
always
while
you
are
i
am
bored
when
i
am
overcome
with
the
feeling
only
my
love
s
away
i
d
as
lief
the
blue
were
gray
i
shall
think
of
this
ride
and
remember
that
i
made
resolutions
to
be
all
to
be
more
patient
i
can
so
well
understand
how
it
was
with
the
foolish
virgins
it
is
never
amusing
to
wait
long
i
should
have
gone
to
sleep
i
am
sure
i
should
have
been
caught
with
my
lamp
extinguished
do
you
know
that
seeing
you
so
lost
to
every
thought
but
the
welfare
of
that
poor
woman
during
the
days
when
she
was
so
near
given
me
i
think
a
more
abiding
sense
of
sweet
charity
how
divinely
serious
your
face
is
just
in
its
earnestness
my
heroic
moods
are
exotics
the
wings
of
my
soul
are
not
and
it
takes
but
very
short
flights
it
comes
nestling
back
to
earth
so
quickly
it
will
follow
in
the
wake
of
your
vessel
all
the
way
you
may
not
see
it
but
it
will
be
at
dawn
leave
your
cabin
window
open
for
it
is
only
the
spirit
of
a
dead
soul
that
can
go
through
cracks
and
bars
of
iron
and
and
will
your
beloved
little
soul
come
and
lay
a
kiss
on
my
face
no
it
is
not
the
vocation
of
a
soul
to
nor
even
to
whisper
those
delicious
little
that
make
me
so
happy
cruel
little
soul
why
then
will
it
come
all
that
long
way
to
get
into
your
waistcoat
pocket
with
your
watch
and
count
how
fast
time
it
was
past
nine
o
clock
when
they
returned
to
the
peeloo
station
the
host
and
courtland
lingered
at
the
stable
after
they
dismounted
langdale
and
stella
bade
each
other
farewell
on
the
wide
veranda
covered
in
with
and
a
luxuriant
queensland
bignonia
langdale
had
to
leave
by
daybreak
as
he
was
anxious
about
one
of
the
patients
he
visited
that
splitter
living
among
the
great
tiers
of
peppermint
eucalyptus
that
lay
behind
the
messmate
man
who
had
been
injured
by
a
falling
tree
stella
was
very
brave
and
kept
a
smiling
face
to
the
last
then
she
went
in
and
chatted
for
awhile
with
the
lady
of
the
house
while
the
men
smoked
on
the
veranda
she
had
gone
to
her
own
room
before
they
came
in
xxxvii
laurette
had
never
been
more
airily
cheerful
and
full
of
gossip
than
she
was
on
the
day
after
stella
s
arrival
we
have
all
the
morning
to
gossip
in
i
asked
carter
and
dora
to
afternoon
tea
so
there
is
no
chance
of
their
dropping
in
at
some
unearthly
hour
evening
we
are
going
to
rehearsals
of
private
theatricals
at
the
jorans
by
the
way
they
have
returned
from
england
since
you
were
here
they
are
among
our
de
la
in
melbourne
what
confers
the
distinction
well
at
present
the
very
inner
circle
is
rather
and
of
course
has
the
right
of
tambour
at
government
house
and
one
must
be
very
wealthy
or
made
a
slight
pause
so
as
to
make
the
point
with
one
must
be
connected
with
the
british
aristocracy
or
with
the
viceregal
when
the
two
are
combined
one
must
hold
every
blessing
that
this
life
affords
in
the
hollow
of
one
s
hand
said
stella
with
a
becoming
gravity
yes
my
dear
unless
one
has
to
retreat
to
the
depths
of
the
mallee
scrub
as
i
must
shortly
do
but
i
shall
devote
myself
to
the
education
of
the
children
but
about
the
jorans
thomas
joran
has
had
what
you
might
call
a
romantic
career
the
very
earliest
glimpse
of
him
in
colonial
history
he
hawked
elderly
cabbages
in
the
streets
of
least
they
would
have
been
streets
if
they
had
been
made
well
i
don
t
mean
that
any
decaying
vegetable
is
romantic
but
then
compare
the
status
of
a
man
employed
in
that
way
and
one
who
entertains
a
duke
and
goes
to
court
but
it
was
rather
a
sell
about
the
duke
you
see
the
jorans
entertained
him
sumptuously
some
people
say
that
in
all
they
spent
four
thousand
pounds
on
him
in
less
than
a
week
what
it
must
have
cost
them
in
special
trains
alone
i
myself
have
sometimes
seen
joran
haggard
with
anxiety
hunting
up
railway
officials
while
joran
stood
sentinel
lest
a
common
populace
should
even
peep
in
at
the
blue
satin
lining
or
the
butler
who
was
in
a
separate
compartment
in
charge
of
the
ice
and
champagne
naturally
a
man
could
not
have
all
this
gold
and
incense
lavished
on
him
without
making
some
return
so
when
the
duke
left
our
shores
he
cordially
invited
the
jorans
to
visit
rookcourt
when
they
were
next
in
england
thinking
he
was
safe
because
they
had
only
just
returned
but
the
dear
duke
had
scarcely
sailed
when
weighty
reasons
compelled
the
jorans
to
do
likewise
in
fact
joran
in
a
burst
of
confidence
confided
to
me
that
it
would
be
unpardonable
not
to
respond
to
the
duke
s
pressing
invitation
but
sad
to
say
the
only
recognition
his
grace
accorded
them
was
that
a
younger
son
asked
joran
to
lunch
with
him
at
a
radical
club
you
may
talk
of
the
aboriginal
myths
but
i
think
they
are
very
paltry
compared
to
spending
five
or
six
thousand
pounds
and
getting
in
return
a
lunch
it
could
not
have
cost
more
for
out
of
compliment
to
his
guest
lord
augustus
had
colonial
claret
the
kind
we
can
buy
in
melbourne
at
fifteen
shillings
a
gallon
oh
i
assure
you
it
was
quite
five
or
six
thousand
pounds
the
jorans
spent
between
the
voyages
and
a
mansion
in
park
lane
for
three
months
and
servants
that
made
them
believe
the
nobility
never
ate
beefsteak
that
cost
less
than
a
pound
still
this
last
visit
to
england
was
not
altogether
without
consolation
the
british
government
was
about
that
time
bent
on
what
is
called
knitting
the
bands
of
the
empire
closer
so
people
from
the
remotest
isles
and
colonies
were
patronized
and
invited
in
troops
like
tenants
on
to
various
very
funny
entertainments
the
jorans
went
with
a
crowd
of
others
to
lunch
or
breakfast
or
something
at
windsor
castle
the
greatest
in
the
arrangement
was
that
an
court
official
was
heard
to
exclaim
in
despair
good
lord
i
thought
this
was
the
day
for
the
negroes
joran
never
mentions
the
windsor
visit
to
me
now
she
did
so
once
or
twice
to
begin
with
but
i
invariably
said
well
it
must
have
been
comical
to
see
all
those
darkies
from
benares
and
ceylon
and
the
malay
peninsula
and
by
the
way
were
there
any
of
the
chins
from
burmah
who
hang
missionaries
to
make
the
rice
grow
i
take
an
interest
in
them
because
the
dowager
countess
of
s
aunt
you
a
small
fortune
on
the
dreadful
but
no
i
am
mixing
things
up
like
the
poor
or
whoever
it
was
haven
t
you
heard
the
story
dear
mrs
joran
naturally
she
doesn
t
give
one
the
chance
to
trot
this
out
too
well
i
suppose
joran
does
not
sheathe
her
claws
when
she
gets
a
chance
to
tell
you
amusing
anecdotes
said
stella
who
sat
listening
to
this
sprightly
malice
with
a
good
deal
of
amusement
i
have
always
heard
that
kindness
and
a
wish
to
please
are
at
the
root
of
true
you
seem
to
have
the
article
here
to
oh
that
s
all
very
well
when
one
is
in
the
country
returned
laurette
why
when
i
am
at
cannawijera
and
the
squatters
wives
around
ask
me
my
opinion
of
their
bonnets
i
assure
them
they
are
perfectly
things
you
know
with
black
cotton
lace
and
the
wings
of
those
african
parrots
that
tear
your
eyes
out
with
their
staring
yellow
and
green
oh
talbot
is
well
thanks
he
has
gone
into
some
sort
of
partnership
with
a
man
who
buys
land
at
a
shilling
a
yard
and
sells
it
at
a
foot
mining
is
so
frightfully
land
is
too
but
you
can
cut
up
land
it
seems
into
minute
globules
and
yet
build
houses
on
it
i
don
t
understand
exactly
how
it
is
done
and
yet
i
have
seen
it
in
a
way
just
as
i
have
seen
conjurers
tricks
you
give
one
of
these
men
your
handkerchief
and
he
gets
eggs
out
of
you
know
there
were
none
when
you
gave
it
to
him
driving
about
in
the
suburbs
i
have
often
seen
vacant
pieces
of
land
for
awhile
there
are
great
placards
as
big
as
a
house
put
up
on
lofty
poles
this
valuable
piece
of
land
situated
in
the
very
best
suburb
of
the
metropolis
of
the
southern
hemisphere
is
to
be
sold
at
a
ridiculously
low
price
and
so
on
that
is
what
they
write
on
these
enormous
placards
and
though
there
is
nothing
to
be
seen
near
them
except
perhaps
a
few
dirty
children
and
rusty
kerosene
tins
when
you
see
such
an
announcement
in
big
letters
for
a
few
weeks
you
somehow
begin
to
believe
it
then
there
are
columns
in
the
newspapers
about
the
rising
suburb
which
is
coveted
by
the
of
australia
the
suburb
where
the
irritating
hum
of
the
sanguinary
mosquito
is
never
heard
then
you
get
a
fat
letter
containing
an
elegant
circular
with
daisies
and
butterflies
round
the
border
and
a
map
of
the
showing
that
in
some
way
every
blessing
this
earth
affords
is
grouped
round
the
rising
suburb
if
you
read
the
advertisement
and
the
circular
and
have
a
note
to
spare
and
never
go
near
the
land
you
re
sure
in
the
end
to
buy
an
allotment
you
see
you
need
pay
only
a
few
pounds
to
begin
with
but
then
you
pay
a
few
shillings
a
week
as
well
for
the
rest
of
your
life
or
till
you
throw
it
mean
the
land
not
your
life
though
some
unfortunate
people
have
done
both
but
if
you
do
that
you
lose
all
you
have
paid
so
altogether
it
comes
to
a
lot
of
i
am
afraid
the
boom
as
they
call
it
is
going
off
for
at
a
sale
last
week
only
the
auctioneer
and
the
boy
that
rang
the
bell
and
talbot
turned
up
but
now
tell
me
about
lull
and
and
all
your
people
there
and
the
mortons
don
t
they
live
not
far
off
and
who
is
this
langdale
all
the
good
people
rave
about
only
once
before
had
laurette
seen
the
colour
flash
into
stella
s
face
in
such
endless
wavelets
to
hide
her
confusion
she
broke
into
a
laughing
account
of
some
of
morton
s
funny
little
stories
but
without
this
laurette
had
concluded
that
all
julia
s
surmises
were
well
founded
the
girl
looked
so
radiantly
so
insultingly
happy
she
fell
into
such
dreamy
little
lips
softly
parted
her
eyes
shining
with
a
gentler
irradiation
than
of
old
and
then
she
studiously
avoided
langdale
s
name
heartless
coquette
that
she
was
after
encouraging
ted
s
addresses
for
years
she
was
now
prepared
to
throw
him
over
at
a
moment
s
notice
to
satisfy
an
absurd
whim
of
being
in
love
as
if
there
were
no
such
thing
as
duty
in
the
world
nothing
was
more
characteristic
of
laurette
than
the
way
in
which
she
always
fell
back
on
the
moral
foundations
of
life
as
the
true
mainspring
of
her
actions
when
she
found
herself
in
what
she
called
a
she
ignored
everything
that
it
suited
her
to
forget
and
when
meditating
some
paltry
little
scheme
that
had
every
element
of
meanness
and
treachery
on
a
small
scale
a
virtuous
glow
stole
over
her
as
if
she
were
reinforced
by
the
law
and
the
prophets
and
obedience
to
the
ten
commandments
was
what
she
lived
for
but
here
she
seemed
to
have
entered
a
in
which
there
was
no
move
in
her
power
that
could
further
her
purposes
there
is
nothing
so
easy
to
make
as
a
tradition
one
of
our
novelists
once
wrote
and
many
lesser
people
find
it
also
very
easy
upon
occasion
there
was
no
tradition
oral
or
written
that
laurette
was
not
prepared
to
invent
but
to
what
avail
ted
would
come
and
the
first
few
words
between
him
and
stella
might
serve
to
explode
all
laurette
s
painstaking
efforts
to
keep
the
girl
in
the
strait
and
narrow
path
of
duty
a
point
had
come
in
which
invention
without
deeds
was
what
could
she
do
nothing
except
wait
the
course
of
events
with
a
heart
prepared
for
any
little
justifiable
artifice
that
would
keep
her
brother
s
life
from
being
wrecked
by
the
selfish
perversity
of
a
heedless
bent
only
on
her
own
scheme
of
happiness
regardless
of
the
sacred
claims
of
the
past
she
was
undoubtedly
in
love
with
this
she
engaged
to
him
a
hundred
times
the
question
rose
to
laurette
s
lips
a
feverish
sort
of
hopelessness
grew
on
her
as
she
marked
those
little
signs
that
in
themselves
are
so
slight
and
which
yet
linked
together
furnish
so
strong
a
chain
of
evidence
many
things
had
conspired
to
tax
laurette
s
nerves
lately
and
she
found
this
additional
suspense
intolerable
but
the
instinct
of
secrecy
of
concealment
which
comes
to
be
a
second
nature
with
those
in
whom
a
life
of
small
intrigue
has
grown
and
waxed
strong
restrained
her
nothing
could
after
all
be
gained
by
asking
this
question
she
would
wait
and
watch
stella
escaped
early
into
her
own
room
that
night
and
wrote
for
a
long
time
a
happy
light
on
her
face
and
warm
blushes
often
mantling
in
her
cheeks
which
would
have
told
their
own
tale
to
an
onlooker
this
was
what
she
wrote
dearest
friend
i
was
half
glad
and
half
sorry
that
we
did
not
meet
in
the
morning
our
homeward
ride
was
so
altogether
far
removed
from
the
ordinary
grooves
of
was
better
to
part
in
the
starlight
and
see
each
other
no
more
i
almost
wish
we
should
not
meet
again
till
you
return
from
england
and
yet
of
course
it
is
only
my
pen
that
says
this
yes
i
soon
went
to
my
room
i
sat
without
a
lamp
looking
out
into
the
beautiful
night
with
its
soft
deep
glow
and
ethereal
starlight
and
i
made
a
picture
of
it
all
in
my
mind
which
i
will
keep
forever
and
forever
oh
i
am
so
very
sure
that
nothing
we
can
see
in
any
other
world
in
any
other
life
can
be
dearer
or
more
alluring
than
that
ride
together
over
the
great
plain
stretching
indefinitely
on
every
side
as
if
it
passed
beyond
the
confines
of
the
world
the
shadowy
clumps
of
trees
the
dark
lines
that
marked
the
watercourses
the
tall
kangaroo
grass
undulating
gently
like
stormless
billows
the
cries
of
far
overhead
the
muffled
of
our
horses
the
boundless
expanse
the
solitude
above
all
the
pale
wistful
light
making
visible
the
faint
lilac
of
the
sky
the
uncertain
of
the
held
them
all
making
a
picture
of
them
that
should
not
pass
away
i
looked
at
them
long
and
steadfastly
till
the
secret
of
their
changeless
uniformity
their
unbroken
peace
their
sweet
serenity
penetrated
my
heart
do
you
remember
the
fragrance
of
the
wild
geraniums
that
our
horses
crushed
under
their
hoofs
in
one
place
it
comes
floating
in
with
the
moonbeams
at
this
moment
but
to
be
the
elixir
of
life
it
must
be
accompanied
with
the
sound
of
a
voice
which
in
all
god
s
wide
but
is
this
what
one
writes
to
a
friend
and
what
is
the
use
of
trying
to
make
a
pen
say
all
that
rises
in
the
heart
oh
you
little
cold
good
creature
i
say
to
it
you
are
sometimes
wonderfully
cunning
you
have
a
tongue
of
your
own
that
often
dives
down
after
thoughts
and
brings
them
out
triumphantly
after
a
fashion
that
sets
stammering
speech
at
defiance
but
where
are
your
eyes
that
brighten
with
happy
smiles
and
grow
dim
with
excess
of
joy
and
where
are
your
cheeks
to
glow
and
turn
cold
in
a
breath
and
above
all
where
are
your
hands
that
with
a
touch
a
little
timid
clasp
make
the
tongue
feel
like
a
clown
who
has
nothing
to
say
but
the
tags
of
songs
long
known
by
heart
all
these
gifts
come
to
you
only
in
the
hands
of
a
master
from
whom
you
learn
the
strange
magic
of
playing
on
the
hearts
of
men
from
generation
to
generation
like
a
clarion
heard
at
dawn
but
i
have
no
power
to
teach
you
how
to
tell
the
thoughts
that
rise
in
my
hearts
in
these
wonderful
long
swift
days
in
which
so
many
thousand
strange
sweet
shuddering
thoughts
storm
and
foam
and
then
flow
in
strong
deep
tranquillity
like
an
impetuous
mountain
brook
that
grows
ever
wider
till
it
becomes
a
river
and
loses
itself
in
the
sea
but
help
me
little
pen
to
tell
a
few
of
these
myriad
fleeting
thoughts
that
will
not
let
sleep
come
beyond
the
threshold
is
it
true
then
that
this
dear
friend
and
i
belong
to
each
other
for
time
and
eternity
that
neither
life
nor
death
nor
principalities
nor
powers
can
ever
mar
the
perfectness
of
our
love
is
this
true
yesterday
is
irrevocably
ours
and
belongs
to
us
and
dawns
that
we
may
still
know
how
perfect
life
may
be
henceforth
our
lives
are
within
the
other
in
heart
and
to
live
apart
even
though
seas
may
roll
between
and
continents
divide
us
and
can
it
be
that
from
year
to
year
the
heavens
will
be
so
high
and
golden
the
earth
so
wide
and
loving
that
the
heart
will
thrill
with
a
power
of
loving
which
lifts
the
soul
as
on
eagle
pinions
till
life
and
death
are
but
twin
brothers
equally
welcome
so
that
we
are
undivided
ah
what
a
strange
thought
almost
to
wish
for
death
now
yes
would
it
not
be
good
to
escape
a
possibility
of
the
cruel
ironies
that
nature
keeps
so
often
in
store
for
the
children
of
men
can
any
mortal
measure
the
power
which
time
has
to
bring
in
its
train
change
and
weariness
what
if
the
day
should
come
when
this
love
so
strong
and
ardent
now
should
become
one
more
of
the
beautiful
illusions
of
life
a
deserted
pavilion
flecked
through
and
through
with
the
mildew
of
indifference
has
my
heart
been
too
readily
given
is
it
not
written
in
song
and
story
that
men
prize
most
what
is
won
with
difficulty
but
as
for
me
the
first
time
we
spoke
to
each
other
did
not
my
heart
stir
tumultuously
could
i
not
have
opened
my
eyes
if
i
had
willed
that
day
when
the
storm
had
raged
so
it
not
because
i
hungered
to
hear
him
speak
his
love
well
be
it
so
i
am
glad
that
i
know
the
it
will
be
with
me
through
these
long
months
of
separation
like
a
nest
of
singing
birds
whose
wings
grow
strong
for
flight
and
who
yet
like
doves
that
fly
afar
in
the
always
return
to
their
before
night
falls
tell
me
of
the
gentle
tender
thoughts
which
cast
out
every
lurking
shadow
of
fear
of
the
new
ties
that
may
arise
to
knit
us
ever
closer
heart
to
heart
in
the
higher
duties
of
life
till
we
learn
by
a
mortal
yearning
to
ascend
seeking
a
higher
object
till
in
imagination
i
draw
near
to
the
dim
bourne
without
any
yes
even
death
must
doff
his
terrors
when
we
know
that
the
infinitely
beloved
of
our
soul
must
pass
through
the
shadow
of
the
dark
valley
ah
gentle
kindly
death
grant
us
that
last
favour
of
to
be
long
apart
after
the
last
farewells
are
spoken
after
all
it
is
the
might
of
love
that
takes
the
victory
from
death
and
robs
the
grave
of
its
terror
we
learn
to
know
too
well
that
not
a
clod
can
ever
touch
the
outer
bark
of
the
spirit
s
life
abide
with
me
thoughts
of
pensive
gentleness
that
fill
the
mind
with
calm
till
all
forecasting
doubts
and
fears
are
swallowed
in
the
azure
of
peace
like
clouds
that
wander
on
the
wide
horizon
till
they
are
spun
into
the
flawless
dome
of
heaven
after
all
little
pen
there
is
a
touch
of
the
laity
about
you
so
that
the
heart
can
not
take
you
into
its
full
confidence
but
do
not
stand
in
the
outer
court
of
the
dear
friend
for
whom
you
are
writing
loves
our
babbling
what
other
small
broods
of
fancies
do
you
hear
chirping
out
their
slender
roundelays
no
let
us
not
speak
of
our
happiness
it
is
foolish
to
cut
snippets
out
of
so
endless
a
theme
what
was
that
little
whisper
of
fear
or
regret
nothing
so
resolute
as
these
feelings
but
a
vagrant
little
misgiving
that
trips
so
swiftly
before
one
looks
it
in
the
face
one
can
not
say
whether
it
is
a
scout
or
a
forerunner
or
an
idle
little
who
has
nothing
to
do
but
snatch
an
ear
of
corn
melting
melodious
airs
to
the
most
wayward
woodland
fancies
are
you
not
afraid
to
marry
when
you
are
so
desperately
in
love
ah
wicked
little
rover
i
have
caught
you
merrily
whistling
your
treasons
now
i
have
put
the
tip
of
my
pen
through
your
errant
fancy
and
transfixed
it
for
my
friend
i
should
not
wonder
if
he
would
beat
you
as
blue
as
a
violet
when
he
catches
you
but
what
treacherous
little
arrow
have
you
let
fly
let
me
get
at
the
core
of
this
lay
which
leaves
a
sting
behind
youth
love
and
marriage
are
these
the
three
fearful
felicities
of
a
woman
s
life
and
is
the
most
fearful
of
these
marriage
and
love
the
most
exquisite
vision
which
life
holds
is
it
in
imminent
peril
when
it
is
imprisoned
in
the
service
of
life
lovely
as
one
of
the
muses
and
crowned
with
the
first
violets
of
spring
this
vision
loved
to
wander
solitary
on
mountain
peaks
when
they
were
first
lightly
touched
with
the
vermilion
of
brightening
day
it
came
and
went
at
radiant
dream
casting
a
glamour
over
the
world
like
the
reflection
of
a
damask
rose
falling
athwart
the
chalice
of
a
white
magnolia
dreams
shun
the
glare
of
day
but
one
morning
the
voice
of
him
to
whom
this
vision
of
right
belonged
called
to
it
to
come
from
its
lonely
haunts
and
abide
by
the
altar
which
he
had
dedicated
to
it
in
a
secure
is
it
too
secure
too
untroubled
who
could
believe
that
a
little
air
of
revelry
whistled
on
an
oaten
pipe
by
the
most
of
wandering
minstrels
should
awaken
such
qualms
go
on
little
altar
fitted
to
guard
the
fairest
dreams
even
love
s
purple
wings
and
golden
arrows
are
touched
to
finer
issues
when
they
are
consecrated
with
vows
yes
like
other
monarchs
he
comes
to
his
kingdom
by
making
covenants
and
yet
and
yet
we
can
not
give
up
the
dream
for
the
reality
without
and
doubt
and
something
of
poignant
regret
flashes
of
thought
come
like
cloven
tongues
of
fire
in
whose
light
the
soul
waxes
faint
and
timorous
and
cries
in
anguish
is
it
then
true
that
love
s
inmost
life
is
rooted
in
the
senses
are
its
keenest
aspirations
to
be
tamed
like
caged
birds
to
be
merged
in
the
commonness
of
every
day
content
yet
for
all
possible
fears
and
doubts
and
questions
there
is
an
answer
perfect
love
casteth
out
fear
love
the
crowning
felicity
of
life
that
light
of
the
world
which
shines
more
unquenchably
than
the
stars
of
heaven
it
is
strong
not
only
to
bear
sorrow
and
anguish
but
also
to
meet
the
common
needs
and
common
joys
of
daily
life
buoyant
enough
to
sustain
the
secure
happiness
of
wedded
as
well
as
the
despair
of
parted
lovers
dear
friend
does
this
appear
to
you
as
the
cloven
foot
of
those
heretical
images
of
marriage
which
haunt
me
so
often
but
who
can
go
through
life
with
open
eyes
and
not
perceive
that
the
average
run
of
married
people
seem
to
have
but
entered
on
business
contracts
in
which
anything
like
the
ardour
of
love
is
absent
as
conspicuously
as
in
any
huckster
s
bargain
do
you
remember
my
telling
you
one
day
that
i
could
not
be
so
very
sorry
for
romeo
and
juliet
you
asked
me
why
and
a
bird
flew
snapping
by
and
i
followed
it
to
make
sure
whether
it
had
a
white
spot
above
each
eye
and
then
though
you
may
not
think
it
ever
belovedest
friend
i
often
hesitated
to
say
things
because
of
your
calm
clear
reasonableness
but
now
there
is
no
bird
and
you
are
three
hundred
miles
away
therefore
do
i
thank
the
gods
that
here
and
there
we
have
the
immortal
story
of
lovers
who
died
before
their
hearts
and
lives
were
touched
with
the
corrosion
of
life
s
invading
commonness
why
should
we
regret
those
who
knew
how
to
die
so
well
for
dear
love
s
sake
so
many
and
so
many
live
to
bear
false
witness
to
sit
under
a
ragged
banner
and
eat
garlic
nor
ask
to
be
stayed
with
flagons
and
comforted
with
wine
but
then
again
there
are
the
fortunate
few
i
must
stop
i
should
have
written
to
my
mother
this
evening
but
i
wrote
to
you
instead
though
i
parted
from
you
only
the
day
before
yesterday
oh
anselm
langdale
do
you
not
call
this
the
utmost
peak
to
which
ingratitude
can
climb
a
mother
s
love
whose
is
like
it
so
much
asking
so
little
do
not
pretend
that
you
ask
little
history
poetry
the
drama
your
eyes
all
betray
you
but
this
first
tender
love
that
enfolded
us
from
the
dawn
of
life
that
bore
with
all
our
waywardness
that
watched
over
us
in
illness
that
was
with
us
like
the
benediction
of
god
when
we
first
folded
our
hands
in
prayer
and
then
like
chickens
we
leave
the
loving
mother
to
scratch
up
the
dust
for
ourselves
without
the
shadow
of
an
excuse
that
she
pecks
us
away
in
favour
of
a
younger
brood
don
t
i
know
have
i
not
watched
my
old
hen
augusta
rearing
brood
after
brood
and
now
i
watch
myself
looking
forward
to
the
return
of
the
with
hardly
a
pang
hardly
a
pang
you
a
heart
that
keeps
time
to
all
day
long
yes
and
beats
wide
awake
at
night
to
keep
up
the
revel
think
of
to
leave
the
sweet
mother
when
the
night
is
drawing
on
apace
when
all
the
vivid
personal
gladness
of
being
alive
is
over
to
wander
to
the
far
ends
of
the
earth
perhaps
to
meet
never
again
oh
infinite
pathos
and
mystery
of
our
being
life
hast
thou
never
a
draught
of
joy
to
offer
that
is
sparkling
throughout
i
am
ashamed
i
did
not
write
to
my
mother
instead
of
writing
to
you
and
yet
no
because
is
friday
and
i
would
not
write
my
first
letter
to
you
on
that
day
for
the
world
it
would
be
a
bad
omen
why
do
you
smile
so
i
could
prove
to
you
that
from
the
first
dawn
of
history
until
now
omens
have
played
a
strange
part
in
the
life
of
man
think
how
ominous
of
their
future
career
it
was
that
all
the
ten
commandments
were
broken
even
before
they
were
given
to
mankind
i
spare
you
the
rest
this
in
itself
is
an
army
set
in
array
tell
me
if
that
poor
splitter
who
was
so
badly
hurt
is
better
has
he
anyone
to
look
after
him
did
you
stay
long
did
you
see
a
lyre
bird
standing
on
a
little
hillock
showing
off
its
like
a
peacock
did
you
set
someone
peeping
from
behind
a
after
you
at
daybreak
yesterday
morning
when
you
rode
away
and
now
not
another
word
i
am
going
to
get
you
that
keepsake
i
promised
you
on
the
veranda
of
peeloo
station
always
your
your
sweet
charity
and
the
when
stella
finished
she
rose
and
unfastened
the
coils
of
her
hair
which
fell
below
her
waist
like
a
mantle
of
gold
she
cut
a
thick
lock
soft
and
silky
with
a
ripple
in
it
as
if
it
had
fallen
out
of
curl
she
folded
it
up
in
silver
which
had
been
wrapped
round
a
small
vial
of
attar
of
roses
then
she
enclosed
it
in
the
sheets
sealed
and
addressed
the
letter
and
put
it
on
the
in
the
receptacle
for
letters
to
be
posted
at
ten
xxxviii
a
little
afterwards
laurette
came
out
into
the
hall
with
some
notes
saw
this
letter
and
regarded
it
as
the
answer
to
all
her
conjectures
she
took
it
up
and
looked
at
it
with
a
strange
expression
on
her
face
it
was
bulky
with
double
postage
on
it
and
that
eastern
fragrance
clung
to
it
of
a
thousand
crushed
into
a
of
liquid
which
had
been
dear
to
stella
from
childhood
laurette
remembered
as
a
girl
seeing
some
of
the
little
vials
full
of
this
essence
which
some
connection
of
the
courtlands
sent
to
the
girls
from
persia
where
he
was
in
the
diplomatic
service
of
his
country
laurette
could
hardly
have
explained
why
the
reminiscence
heightened
that
spite
never
very
distant
from
the
feeling
with
which
she
regarded
stella
it
was
merely
one
of
the
insignificant
little
events
that
is
part
of
the
life
of
a
family
whose
cadets
have
for
generations
pushed
their
way
into
every
quarter
of
the
globe
in
the
civil
and
military
service
of
britain
but
such
circumstances
had
to
laurette
s
sharp
envious
mind
marked
the
gulf
which
in
the
old
country
had
separated
her
own
people
from
those
to
whom
the
courtlands
belonged
though
in
australia
the
position
was
in
some
degree
reversed
she
held
the
letter
a
moment
in
her
hand
then
put
it
back
with
the
rest
if
any
object
could
be
gained
by
destroying
or
opening
it
she
would
not
have
hesitated
to
take
either
course
there
would
have
been
no
balancing
of
struggle
between
good
and
simply
a
swift
calculation
as
to
the
chances
of
detection
and
if
that
could
be
evaded
prompt
action
as
it
would
serve
her
interests
when
men
or
women
have
passed
many
years
in
an
atmosphere
of
small
habitual
duplicities
shifty
meannesses
and
unscrupulous
all
the
time
tempered
by
a
cunning
caution
the
nature
becomes
ingrained
with
a
moral
imbecility
that
seems
absolutely
proof
against
any
stirring
of
conscience
laurette
returned
to
the
and
shortly
afterwards
her
husband
came
home
his
appearance
at
that
early
hour
was
a
little
shock
to
her
nor
was
it
misplaced
he
at
once
broached
the
subject
which
led
to
his
phenomenal
movements
that
riverina
fellow
has
seen
me
again
he
is
willing
to
give
an
advance
of
two
hundred
pounds
for
this
place
on
the
rent
we
pay
i
have
told
him
he
may
most
likely
have
it
at
the
end
of
this
well
that
was
kind
of
you
said
laurette
trying
to
laugh
but
it
was
an
unsuccessful
attempt
and
her
face
had
blanched
to
this
tareling
made
no
reply
i
am
going
to
sleep
at
the
club
and
make
an
early
start
to
beechfield
about
some
land
there
i
thought
i
d
better
tell
you
as
early
as
possible
about
giving
up
this
and
going
to
cannawijera
with
the
children
and
the
maids
precisely
unless
your
father
wishes
to
have
you
at
godolphin
house
what
the
devil
made
them
give
the
place
such
a
name
as
that
it
seems
like
a
bad
most
things
do
in
the
colonies
don
t
they
ah
i
don
t
know
that
we
need
go
into
these
details
you
understand
about
the
house
i
have
not
given
an
absolute
no
and
you
must
not
said
laurette
suddenly
rising
with
quivering
lips
if
you
suppose
that
i
am
going
to
bury
myself
in
the
heart
of
the
mallee
tareling
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
such
an
imperturbable
air
that
laurette
at
once
checked
herself
you
have
a
good
deal
of
temperament
at
times
he
said
smoothly
after
a
little
pause
but
if
you
think
over
it
you
will
see
that
here
it
is
really
worse
than
useless
i
must
have
six
or
seven
hundred
pounds
early
in
october
and
two
hundred
pounds
clear
is
more
than
i
can
afford
to
lose
besides
you
are
only
getting
into
debt
every
and
you
what
will
you
do
oh
i
shall
manage
thanks
answered
tareling
examining
his
critically
yes
you
will
manage
to
get
into
probably
but
there
will
be
and
then
my
father
will
have
to
pay
another
you
are
developing
a
remarkable
turn
for
figures
and
i
notice
you
do
not
mix
up
amounts
like
some
women
i
wish
you
had
been
as
accurate
when
we
first
met
and
you
dropped
those
artless
hints
about
being
heiress
to
the
tune
of
five
or
six
thousand
a
oh
good
heavens
if
i
had
only
known
if
i
could
have
foreseen
ah
exactly
if
we
could
both
have
foreseen
but
as
that
was
a
gift
denied
to
us
we
married
but
if
you
will
excuse
tareling
stood
up
taking
his
watch
out
well
talbot
i
ll
excuse
you
if
you
excuse
me
said
laurette
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
and
manner
i
should
have
told
you
before
that
ted
is
going
to
give
me
another
fifteen
hundred
pounds
at
the
end
of
this
i
must
not
leave
melbourne
at
the
latest
till
the
season
is
quite
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
this
i
first
spoke
of
the
house
well
you
see
i
thought
i
would
keep
all
this
second
cheque
for
current
expenses
and
the
most
pressing
you
had
nearly
half
of
the
first
lot
but
you
can
have
what
you
need
early
in
oh
well
i
suppose
i
had
better
tell
this
fellow
circumstances
have
turned
up
that
prevent
our
letting
the
and
with
a
nod
the
honourable
talbot
tareling
left
the
domestic
hearth
for
some
time
after
he
was
gone
laurette
sat
sunk
in
reflections
early
in
october
yes
that
was
about
the
time
that
the
company
to
which
mademoiselle
de
melier
belonged
was
to
leave
for
san
francisco
laurette
had
known
for
some
time
that
her
husband
contemplated
a
change
of
scene
people
who
had
known
him
intimately
before
his
marriage
were
amazed
that
he
had
remained
in
the
colonies
so
long
countries
in
which
work
is
the
paramount
social
factor
are
always
more
or
less
crude
in
their
resources
of
amusement
and
then
the
ritchie
family
was
cutting
up
so
confoundedly
rough
about
money
matters
laurette
had
long
recognised
that
there
was
nothing
in
her
husband
s
nature
to
which
any
appeal
could
successfully
be
made
that
clashed
with
his
own
ideas
of
enjoyment
his
intrigue
with
this
wretched
little
singing
actress
affected
tareling
little
if
at
all
from
an
ethical
point
of
view
as
she
had
once
said
in
a
burst
of
confidence
to
an
old
school
friend
when
a
girl
marries
into
the
british
nobility
she
must
give
up
bourgeoise
notions
of
neither
could
she
be
deeply
wounded
through
the
affections
but
there
is
always
a
vulnerable
that
with
laurette
was
her
social
success
if
talbot
worked
out
his
present
plans
laurette
s
prospects
centred
not
only
in
social
extinction
in
the
mallee
scrub
but
something
also
of
social
disgrace
laurette
rose
up
almost
gasping
at
the
prospect
she
did
not
in
the
least
expect
the
second
munificent
cheque
from
ted
knowing
too
well
the
tissue
of
deceit
by
which
she
had
secured
the
first
but
then
this
riverina
family
was
choked
off
and
every
week
made
it
less
likely
that
anyone
else
would
make
as
good
an
offer
for
monico
she
gained
time
to
leave
melbourne
at
this
juncture
would
be
to
give
up
all
she
regretted
not
having
opened
stella
s
letter
was
it
not
possible
she
was
dallying
with
a
new
unable
to
commit
the
extravagant
folly
of
resigning
a
man
with
fifteen
thousand
a
year
for
love
of
one
who
had
not
half
as
many
hundreds
she
had
written
to
julia
urging
her
to
find
out
by
all
means
in
her
power
what
this
sudden
departure
of
langdale
s
portended
she
must
somehow
find
out
the
truth
of
affairs
before
telegraphing
for
ted
as
she
had
promised
to
do
on
stella
s
arrival
in
fact
it
might
be
necessary
to
prevent
their
meeting
at
all
under
her
roof
she
reflected
that
if
one
is
called
to
account
for
conflicting
statements
it
is
always
easier
to
explain
by
letter
my
anxiety
for
your
success
dear
ted
may
have
led
me
to
exaggerate
in
your
favour
etc
as
for
stella
she
would
be
too
happy
and
to
care
about
such
trifles
but
there
s
many
a
slip
twixt
the
cup
and
the
lip
thought
laurette
vindictively
next
morning
s
first
post
brought
letters
to
stella
from
lullaboolagana
and
one
in
a
hand
strange
to
laurette
bearing
the
but
there
was
not
much
room
left
to
her
for
speculation
as
to
the
writer
the
moment
stella
saw
this
letter
her
face
was
suffused
with
happy
blushes
and
she
presently
made
some
excuse
to
escape
with
it
to
her
own
leaving
the
rest
behind
laurette
herself
had
a
note
from
julia
i
have
fished
it
out
of
nell
she
wrote
that
louise
has
not
yet
been
accepted
but
hopes
to
be
on
his
return
he
is
to
be
back
in
three
or
four
months
what
can
be
taking
him
away
perhaps
you
will
see
him
in
a
day
or
two
morrison
told
me
yesterday
that
a
grey
a
friend
of
her
husband
s
has
come
out
by
the
last
and
steamer
and
is
most
likely
coming
to
practise
here
in
partnership
with
on
monday
stella
went
to
stay
for
a
day
and
a
half
with
the
carters
an
hour
after
she
had
driven
away
with
her
brother
a
servant
brought
a
card
to
laurette
it
was
langdale
s
and
he
was
waiting
to
see
her
was
he
going
by
the
french
steamer
which
sailed
in
the
afternoon
could
she
prevent
him
from
seeing
stella
or
would
this
do
any
good
he
would
have
had
her
letter
on
friday
night
while
his
must
have
been
written
on
thursday
a
hundred
thoughts
flew
through
laurette
s
mind
but
she
felt
the
impossibility
of
seeing
her
way
far
ahead
before
she
knew
what
langdale
s
plans
were
only
she
decided
if
he
were
really
leaving
by
the
she
would
say
stella
had
some
place
not
to
be
reached
in
a
few
hours
but
lovers
were
such
awful
would
attempt
the
most
imbecile
feats
well
to
avoid
all
rash
venturing
she
would
state
stella
was
on
her
way
to
mount
macedon
by
an
uncertain
route
who
that
saw
this
pretty
fair
woman
in
her
fresh
blue
morning
dress
greeting
her
visitor
with
an
amiable
smile
could
have
dreamt
what
her
resolves
had
been
a
moment
before
langdale
apologized
for
his
early
call
he
had
arrived
by
the
morning
train
and
was
to
sail
by
the
that
afternoon
and
being
anxious
to
see
miss
courtland
before
oh
had
she
any
idea
you
were
coming
broke
in
laurette
no
langdale
answered
smiling
he
himself
had
not
known
till
six
hours
before
he
left
oh
a
thousand
pities
said
laurette
in
a
sympathetic
voice
miss
courtland
is
now
on
her
way
to
mount
macedon
i
can
not
even
say
by
what
route
or
whether
she
will
reach
her
destination
this
evening
she
may
stay
with
friends
on
the
way
your
woods
seem
to
have
spoiled
stella
for
town
this
was
said
with
an
arch
smile
and
laurette
was
quick
to
note
the
awakened
look
the
swift
flash
with
which
langdale
heard
this
miss
courtland
is
well
i
hope
he
said
a
little
anxiously
oh
yes
radiantly
well
but
more
addicted
to
silence
than
formerly
returned
laurette
meaningly
she
thought
if
she
were
sufficiently
cordial
and
encouraging
if
she
comported
herself
as
if
she
were
quite
behind
the
scenes
she
might
glean
a
little
more
intelligence
at
any
rate
such
a
manner
would
be
likely
to
inspire
confidence
and
nothing
was
more
valuable
than
confidence
when
you
were
bent
on
thwarting
the
confidee
s
little
plans
but
after
all
perhaps
you
need
not
go
added
laurette
i
must
he
he
went
on
to
say
that
his
passage
had
been
booked
in
the
by
telegram
that
she
sailed
at
seven
in
the
evening
and
then
he
asked
leave
to
call
later
with
a
letter
for
miss
courtland
well
thought
laurette
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
this
looks
like
the
finger
of
she
seemed
to
hold
possibilities
in
her
grasp
that
would
be
valuable
and
yet
stella
was
so
unmalleable
in
some
respects
and
laurette
divined
even
from
her
brief
interview
with
langdale
that
one
who
knew
him
much
less
one
who
loved
him
would
not
be
easily
duped
into
doubting
the
man
but
laurette
was
content
to
take
short
views
he
was
going
to
the
other
end
of
the
world
and
to
entrust
a
letter
to
her
care
yes
people
often
wrote
on
the
way
but
on
a
french
boat
one
could
not
write
earlier
than
from
or
six
weeks
ahead
at
the
least
while
what
laurette
was
scheming
for
was
to
get
that
other
fifteen
hundred
pounds
at
the
end
of
september
on
the
plea
of
serving
ted
s
cause
so
well
she
did
not
stir
out
of
the
house
till
langdale
came
and
left
the
letter
she
took
it
at
once
to
her
own
room
and
locked
the
door
she
opened
the
letter
carefully
and
it
yielded
under
her
supple
fingers
without
a
tear
of
course
if
nothing
could
be
gained
by
destroying
it
she
would
close
it
up
again
and
deliver
it
but
a
glance
served
to
show
her
that
it
placed
opportunities
in
her
hand
if
only
she
could
devise
means
of
putting
them
to
use
there
was
a
long
letter
with
a
separate
enclosure
it
was
this
that
first
caught
her
eye
and
brought
the
blood
into
her
face
while
her
heart
beat
tumultuously
then
she
read
the
letter
sweet
charity
your
first
letter
reached
me
an
hour
ago
will
you
ever
know
the
extreme
joy
it
gave
me
and
the
great
lovely
lock
of
hair
it
contained
i
drew
it
to
its
full
length
and
laid
it
against
my
cheek
but
blättchen
knows
the
fatuity
of
pens
in
speaking
of
things
so
far
beyond
their
reach
how
shabby
my
letter
was
compared
to
yours
but
if
i
do
not
take
care
i
shall
not
remember
to
answer
one
of
your
questions
as
i
rode
away
in
the
dawn
from
peeloo
i
looked
back
and
thought
i
saw
a
face
i
knew
at
one
of
the
windows
it
came
with
me
all
the
way
and
showed
me
the
profound
loveliness
of
the
early
morning
light
falling
upon
the
still
woods
the
splitter
is
better
i
stayed
with
him
two
hours
and
he
told
me
a
little
story
that
would
have
delighted
charity
s
heart
i
may
perhaps
tell
it
to
her
when
i
see
her
in
melbourne
and
there
is
something
else
i
must
tell
her
full
reason
for
my
visit
to
england
yes
darling
it
may
pain
you
but
your
letter
makes
me
feel
that
it
is
unworthy
of
us
both
to
hold
it
back
but
this
is
my
first
reply
to
a
letter
of
liebe
s
and
therefore
there
must
be
nothing
in
it
to
pain
her
and
i
may
be
with
her
for
a
little
in
a
day
or
two
how
i
long
to
set
out
so
that
i
may
hasten
back
my
first
reply
to
you
dearest
what
have
i
to
say
oh
i
have
a
great
and
solemn
secret
to
whisper
in
your
ear
don
t
let
dustiefoot
hear
it
and
be
sure
you
do
not
tell
it
to
the
pert
fairacre
birds
who
do
nothing
but
chatter
from
morning
to
night
the
secret
is
this
oh
i
love
love
love
you
did
i
ever
tell
you
before
what
a
darling
you
are
and
how
entirely
i
worship
you
but
that
i
could
not
tell
you
one
could
oh
my
own
do
you
know
what
your
love
means
to
it
has
gladdened
my
life
as
i
never
expected
it
to
be
gladdened
i
told
you
once
that
i
had
suffered
but
some
sorrows
have
power
to
make
strong
and
build
up
while
others
seem
to
eat
up
what
should
go
to
the
woof
of
calm
daily
happiness
that
was
the
sort
of
sorrow
i
have
had
yet
i
felt
and
acknowledged
that
i
myself
was
to
blame
as
most
of
us
are
in
the
misfortunes
that
fall
on
us
apart
from
bereavement
but
the
darkness
is
over
already
i
see
the
gold
of
dawn
which
is
to
broaden
into
the
perfect
day
of
our
happiness
darling
does
it
not
seem
in
some
ways
as
if
we
could
not
be
really
separated
any
more
now
and
henceforth
you
are
part
of
my
inmost
life
each
sight
and
sound
of
nature
is
more
beautiful
since
i
knew
you
here
are
some
lines
that
i
keep
crooning
very
often
when
i
am
alone
she
gave
me
eyes
she
gave
me
ears
and
humble
cares
and
delicate
fears
a
heart
the
fountain
of
sweet
tears
and
love
and
thought
and
joy
yes
love
and
thought
and
joy
how
grateful
i
am
that
the
unspeakable
gift
of
your
love
was
given
to
me
before
time
and
bitter
memories
robbed
me
of
the
capacity
of
joy
it
does
happen
in
life
that
people
are
sometimes
so
crushed
and
made
desolate
that
when
the
possibility
of
happiness
is
restored
to
them
it
comes
too
late
it
is
not
only
that
joy
is
so
prone
to
put
his
hand
to
his
lips
bidding
adieu
but
that
often
when
he
approaches
his
sovereignty
is
over
if
necessary
we
can
endure
our
lives
and
do
our
work
in
the
world
without
the
possession
of
vivid
personal
joy
but
ah
when
it
comes
and
our
hearts
are
still
fresh
and
young
enough
to
bound
at
its
approach
what
is
there
that
we
would
barter
for
its
possession
belovedest
did
i
not
see
tears
glisten
in
your
sweet
eyes
when
we
parted
do
not
allow
too
many
sad
thoughts
to
nestle
in
your
heart
when
i
am
not
near
to
chase
them
afar
there
is
but
a
step
between
being
dejected
for
individual
reasons
and
harbouring
melancholy
forebodings
relative
to
wider
issues
it
is
good
to
remember
that
the
problems
of
life
do
not
crowd
into
our
daily
path
in
the
way
that
they
do
into
our
minds
and
that
in
the
end
we
have
not
to
solve
inextricable
riddles
in
order
to
do
our
best
in
the
world
there
is
one
maxim
you
quoted
out
of
wilhelm
meister
i
would
have
you
liebe
keep
in
mind
all
the
time
i
am
remember
to
live
do
not
let
spectres
come
between
you
and
the
sunshine
you
love
so
well
by
this
i
do
not
mean
try
to
drive
solemn
thoughts
from
you
i
love
to
think
of
you
too
well
as
you
recall
how
in
the
most
mood
a
sudden
seriousness
would
often
fall
upon
your
face
no
i
would
not
have
liebe
different
from
her
dear
self
by
the
twentieth
part
of
the
petal
of
a
fairy
rose
her
quick
moods
and
rippling
fancies
are
all
too
precious
to
me
all
i
plead
for
is
that
she
should
drive
sombre
dreams
to
the
far
ends
of
the
earth
that
she
should
let
no
reflection
of
the
shadow
that
has
burdened
part
of
my
life
throw
any
darkness
on
hers
keep
all
your
buoyant
fancies
darling
and
your
tender
sparkling
gaiety
for
my
sake
i
have
often
felt
that
the
exacting
routine
of
labour
to
which
men
must
school
themselves
brings
in
its
train
something
wooden
and
inflexible
even
when
their
work
makes
constant
demands
on
their
sympathies
i
suppose
it
is
because
of
this
that
a
woman
s
more
inward
and
leisured
habit
of
thought
exercises
so
deep
a
fascination
she
has
time
to
keep
all
these
things
and
ponder
them
in
her
heart
so
that
she
comes
to
have
a
kind
of
second
sight
a
sensitive
delicacy
of
perception
which
with
most
men
is
either
undeveloped
or
swallowed
in
the
grind
of
daily
life
a
woman
sees
a
thousand
things
that
from
their
duller
or
let
us
say
more
preoccupied
eyes
are
almost
wholly
obscured
to
achieve
anything
in
the
world
a
man
has
to
learn
to
be
hard
on
himself
and
that
often
produces
a
certain
hardness
in
other
respects
it
would
seem
that
to
work
long
and
constantly
even
though
the
work
is
what
interests
us
most
begets
a
certain
strain
of
insensibility
thus
i
often
smile
when
i
think
that
though
i
could
draw
separately
and
in
skeleton
form
all
the
bones
of
a
swallow
s
wing
i
learned
the
full
poetry
of
its
flight
through
your
bright
eyes
but
what
is
the
use
of
my
talking
or
rather
writing
in
this
way
when
liebe
persists
in
making
the
most
adorably
comic
little
faces
at
me
and
making
up
a
wicked
little
story
about
what
happened
to
someone
who
had
an
evil
habit
of
writing
in
a
didactic
reasonable
strain
after
all
your
chrysanthemums
will
not
be
out
before
i
return
but
there
will
be
roses
and
mind
you
wear
great
clusters
of
them
on
the
day
the
steams
into
glenelg
dear
day
filled
with
hours
is
that
one
of
liebe
s
phrases
and
will
she
inflict
penalties
on
me
for
using
it
without
leave
so
she
may
only
i
must
draw
up
a
list
of
the
here
followed
a
page
or
two
of
the
ardent
nothings
that
come
so
readily
to
a
lover
s
pen
then
there
was
a
break
and
the
rest
was
dated
that
day
scott
s
hotel
melbourne
deeply
regretting
stella
s
absence
from
town
explaining
how
the
prompt
acceptance
by
a
friend
of
morrison
s
of
a
medical
partnership
at
had
occurred
in
time
to
permit
langdale
taking
his
passage
by
the
french
boat
which
enabled
him
to
set
out
at
once
and
he
was
incredibly
anxious
to
get
away
so
that
he
might
be
back
in
february
and
now
he
wrote
i
am
going
to
tell
you
stella
what
that
business
is
because
ever
since
i
got
your
precious
letter
i
felt
it
was
impossible
i
should
conceal
it
from
you
my
only
reason
for
doing
so
was
that
your
keenly
sensitive
apprehensive
nature
might
dwell
on
the
bare
possibility
that
there
may
still
be
a
barrier
to
our
marriage
but
with
the
exquisite
trust
and
love
you
have
shown
no
consideration
has
force
enough
to
make
me
keep
this
back
from
you
only
it
must
not
be
included
in
this
my
reply
to
liebe
s
first
letter
are
you
satisfied
that
i
am
not
so
calmly
reasonable
after
all
and
that
i
may
even
be
infected
with
a
little
superstition
no
not
superstition
but
delicate
fears
i
shall
not
say
farewell
but
merely
what
we
said
that
night
after
our
most
memorable
auf
baldige
wiedersehen
after
reading
this
with
beating
temples
laurette
turned
once
more
to
the
enclosure
there
were
four
thin
sheets
of
foreign
paper
the
last
being
but
half
written
as
langdale
wrote
a
firm
rather
heavy
hand
he
had
written
on
one
side
only
it
was
a
trifling
circumstance
and
yet
it
was
of
material
service
to
laurette
in
carrying
out
the
plan
that
eventually
took
shape
in
her
unscrupulous
little
brain
at
the
age
of
while
still
a
medical
student
in
london
just
a
year
after
my
father
s
death
i
met
a
lady
a
good
many
years
older
than
myself
who
fascinated
me
greatly
she
was
an
italian
and
very
beautiful
still
infatuated
as
i
was
i
shrank
from
the
idea
of
marrying
her
but
under
circumstances
which
i
need
not
now
detail
i
married
her
four
months
after
we
first
met
the
marriage
turned
out
a
disastrous
failure
after
three
years
we
agreed
to
live
apart
a
year
later
i
knew
that
she
had
proved
unfaithful
to
me
i
had
sufficient
evidence
to
secure
a
divorce
but
partly
because
i
shrank
from
the
a
few
of
my
most
intimate
friends
knew
of
the
because
she
had
fallen
into
very
bad
health
and
besought
me
to
spare
her
as
she
had
not
long
to
live
i
desisted
she
gave
my
lawyer
a
written
acknowledgment
of
her
guilt
duly
attested
resigned
my
name
and
left
england
for
brussels
where
some
of
her
friends
lived
on
these
conditions
i
settled
an
income
on
her
which
she
named
as
being
adequate
and
was
to
be
paid
by
my
lawyer
the
letter
i
opened
in
the
home
field
that
day
was
from
my
lawyer
he
wrote
to
say
that
the
last
receipt
he
had
received
for
this
payment
was
evidently
a
forgery
that
he
had
caused
inquiries
to
be
made
through
a
trusted
agent
and
found
that
the
lady
to
whom
the
money
was
payable
had
died
but
that
the
fact
was
concealed
by
a
relative
who
endeavoured
to
make
capital
out
of
the
imposition
he
found
that
the
lady
who
died
was
buried
under
the
name
of
the
one
with
whom
she
lived
and
an
application
was
for
a
second
time
made
for
the
annuity
with
a
statement
that
the
difference
of
writing
was
caused
by
illness
but
a
request
that
an
interview
should
be
granted
to
one
who
knew
both
ladies
was
denied
no
doubt
could
exist
in
my
lawyer
s
mind
nor
in
my
own
as
to
the
facts
of
the
matter
but
you
will
understand
stella
that
it
is
one
of
the
points
on
which
one
is
satisfied
with
nothing
less
than
legal
indisputable
proof
it
was
my
intention
to
possess
this
before
doing
more
than
asking
leave
to
write
to
you
i
can
not
but
be
glad
that
the
course
of
events
led
to
my
departing
from
this
resolution
the
assurance
of
your
love
is
too
precious
but
you
have
been
so
loyally
trustful
you
have
shown
such
entire
confidence
in
me
it
seems
to
me
now
i
should
have
frankly
told
you
the
position
but
i
shrank
horribly
from
marring
the
first
glow
of
our
happiness
with
this
sordid
story
and
then
there
are
some
misfortunes
in
life
that
men
are
more
sensitive
about
than
many
forms
of
and
yet
my
own
now
that
i
have
won
the
treasure
of
your
love
i
feel
more
than
ever
thankful
that
in
this
early
bond
i
was
the
betrayed
and
not
the
betrayer
it
hurts
me
horribly
that
the
bloom
of
your
gladness
must
be
touched
with
the
thought
of
a
life
which
closed
so
darkly
stained
and
yet
stella
it
is
best
you
should
know
all
our
happy
reunion
on
my
return
should
not
be
spoilt
by
going
back
to
this
it
will
then
be
the
past
for
both
of
us
from
the
moment
i
resolved
to
tell
you
i
felt
a
relief
for
the
conviction
haunted
me
that
i
should
not
have
yielded
to
your
generous
wish
in
the
matter
saying
that
i
had
been
surprised
out
of
my
secret
do
not
be
too
sorry
herzblättchen
think
chiefly
of
what
carries
so
much
joy
for
both
think
of
the
day
on
which
the
will
gaily
sail
into
after
this
came
some
lines
that
had
been
blotted
out
but
so
quickly
dried
that
the
words
were
readable
will
you
forgive
me
if
i
say
that
one
of
the
memories
which
gives
me
the
most
unalloyed
happiness
is
your
timorous
confession
that
you
felt
you
could
have
moved
or
spoken
after
your
accident
when
i
reached
you
only
you
wished
to
know
how
it
would
really
affect
me
yours
stella
with
the
profoundest
respect
and
love
anselm
laurette
s
head
throbbed
with
swiftly
succeeding
and
conflicting
thoughts
as
she
reached
the
close
it
was
apparent
at
once
that
the
first
letter
must
be
kept
back
if
only
on
account
of
its
allusion
to
stella
s
imagined
absence
from
melbourne
and
the
other
the
enclosure
which
taken
by
itself
would
begin
with
such
strange
abruptness
says
ste
beuve
in
one
of
his
critical
essays
if
we
wish
to
be
truthful
we
shall
never
allow
enough
room
for
you
nor
shall
we
ever
make
deep
enough
incisions
in
any
philosophy
of
probably
laurette
herself
could
hardly
say
how
far
the
form
of
this
statement
the
way
in
which
it
was
written
on
one
side
only
of
the
paper
and
the
suggestive
air
of
the
effaced
lines
helped
her
to
work
the
scheme
which
she
put
into
execution
with
unshrinking
completeness
she
sat
for
an
hour
or
two
reading
and
the
words
regarding
the
statement
from
all
sides
with
concentrated
intentness
her
eyes
glittered
strangely
and
a
brilliant
flush
reinforced
the
of
rouge
which
lent
point
to
her
complexion
it
was
characteristic
that
though
on
first
reading
langdale
s
little
narrative
no
doubt
entered
her
mind
as
to
the
death
of
the
unfortunate
woman
whose
life
had
made
his
run
with
so
dark
a
current
for
some
years
yet
the
moment
she
decided
on
her
plan
of
campaign
she
convinced
herself
that
the
news
was
illusory
people
never
die
when
it
adds
to
their
friends
happiness
she
said
to
herself
with
the
decision
of
one
who
argues
from
the
knowledge
of
experience
well
stella
won
t
run
such
a
fearful
risk
if
i
can
help
she
destroyed
the
letter
there
and
then
setting
fire
to
it
in
the
grate
and
watching
it
till
the
last
scrap
was
reduced
to
a
thin
black
cinder
her
next
step
was
to
ring
for
sarah
the
who
had
admitted
langdale
and
brought
her
his
card
sarah
i
want
you
to
get
ready
to
go
to
wandalong
morton
s
place
you
know
by
the
early
train
she
needs
a
little
extra
help
and
i
must
spare
you
for
a
few
weeks
at
any
cost
your
wages
will
be
fifteen
shillings
a
week
as
long
as
you
are
then
she
sent
a
telegram
to
her
sister
feel
sure
you
need
more
help
sarah
goes
to
you
for
a
i
must
run
no
risk
of
servants
tattle
she
thought
with
forced
calm
then
she
sat
down
and
wrote
two
brief
the
first
was
addressed
to
a
anson
and
ran
dear
rose
what
an
age
it
is
since
we
met
can
you
imagine
that
your
grief
and
undeserved
misfortune
have
changed
your
friends
as
it
seems
useless
to
expect
you
to
come
to
me
unless
some
pressure
is
brought
to
bear
i
shall
send
the
carriage
for
you
at
ten
morning
and
you
must
spend
the
day
with
me
i
shall
take
care
we
have
no
visitors
and
no
interruptions
you
see
i
am
determined
to
take
no
the
next
note
ran
dear
stella
as
i
know
the
carters
are
dying
to
have
you
a
little
longer
i
write
to
say
that
i
shall
not
grudge
your
remaining
till
we
call
for
you
evening
on
our
way
to
the
theatre
just
and
a
few
flowers
they
say
the
comedy
company
is
in
splendid
after
that
laurette
set
about
her
task
of
manipulating
the
enclosure
sarah
left
by
the
early
train
and
at
ten
anson
came
she
was
the
wife
of
a
man
who
had
been
high
up
in
the
civil
service
but
who
had
six
months
previously
been
convicted
of
defalcating
the
public
funds
and
sentenced
to
six
years
imprisonment
anson
was
a
gentle
sensitive
woman
who
since
her
misfortune
shrank
into
retirement
as
much
as
possible
yet
felt
a
melancholy
pleasure
in
being
so
warmly
remembered
by
an
old
friend
laurette
on
her
part
was
all
chastened
sympathy
and
delicate
attention
kissing
her
sweet
rose
on
each
cheek
and
holding
her
hands
in
a
gentle
detaining
clasp
you
have
hurt
your
hand
dear
said
anson
in
a
tone
of
concern
noticing
that
the
forefinger
of
laurette
s
right
hand
was
tied
up
oh
a
mere
little
cut
with
the
i
gave
my
nursery
governess
a
holiday
yesterday
and
saw
to
the
little
one
s
dinner
you
are
always
doing
someone
a
kindness
murmured
anson
suddenly
struck
with
the
thought
that
hitherto
she
had
hardly
given
laurette
credit
for
all
her
good
qualities
well
my
dear
it
would
be
a
poor
world
if
we
did
not
help
each
other
with
little
deeds
of
kindness
replied
laurette
not
only
without
a
blush
but
with
a
little
glow
of
virtuous
then
she
sat
and
chatted
about
all
the
people
her
friend
had
known
intimately
in
days
not
long
gone
by
some
who
had
married
and
some
who
expected
to
marry
but
did
not
and
all
equally
repentant
no
little
tale
of
social
disaster
lost
its
piquancy
on
laurette
s
lips
indeed
at
her
best
she
had
a
gift
for
heightening
effects
and
shading
which
many
an
artist
in
journalism
might
envy
the
hours
passed
very
agreeably
there
were
callers
but
laurette
was
denied
to
them
she
had
promised
herself
a
treat
for
the
day
and
she
was
not
going
to
be
cheated
out
of
it
there
was
so
much
insincerity
and
hollowness
in
the
world
as
i
grow
older
i
sometimes
long
to
turn
my
back
on
it
all
she
said
with
a
gentle
little
sigh
poor
anson
though
far
from
being
a
bitter
or
envious
woman
yet
could
not
wholly
escape
a
slight
tinge
of
the
gratification
sometimes
experienced
by
the
unfortunate
when
the
reflection
is
forced
on
them
that
the
disparities
of
life
are
after
all
not
so
great
as
they
appear
on
the
surface
as
they
sat
over
afternoon
tea
several
letters
were
brought
in
to
laurette
one
of
them
seemed
to
distress
her
oh
how
very
thoughtless
of
me
not
to
have
written
that
note
as
i
promised
she
cried
with
a
little
gesture
of
despair
rose
dear
will
you
excuse
me
while
i
pen
a
note
that
i
should
have
sent
away
last
night
thanks
so
she
opened
a
little
morocco
that
was
on
a
small
table
near
her
presently
she
uttered
a
sharp
ejaculation
of
pain
who
would
have
thought
that
such
a
slight
cut
would
be
so
painful
she
cried
but
the
cut
appears
to
be
on
the
front
of
the
finger
said
anson
you
see
the
moment
you
attempt
to
write
the
pen
presses
against
the
oh
how
very
provoking
cried
laurette
knitting
her
brows
prettily
is
it
anything
i
can
do
for
you
laurette
pray
let
me
if
it
is
oh
thank
you
dear
said
laurette
her
face
brightening
it
is
only
an
old
friend
like
you
i
could
have
as
an
amanuensis
in
the
matter
it
is
something
to
be
enclosed
in
a
friend
s
letter
in
corroboration
a
matrimonial
more
serious
than
the
average
run
a
wretched
estrangement
broken
hearts
i
must
not
burden
you
with
a
knowledge
of
names
secrets
are
so
often
a
nuisance
one
is
so
afraid
of
betraying
them
and
of
course
if
it
comes
to
being
questioned
downright
one
tries
to
tell
a
fib
and
fails
i
shall
be
able
to
put
the
beginning
and
sign
my
anson
was
more
and
more
convinced
that
laurette
was
one
of
those
people
who
must
be
well
known
before
they
get
credit
for
all
the
minor
deeds
of
charity
and
little
merciful
acts
of
an
unstrained
quality
they
scatter
on
their
way
through
life
she
sat
down
and
wrote
to
laurette
s
dictation
in
her
elegant
careful
handwriting
with
a
sincere
wish
that
what
she
wrote
would
effect
its
kindly
purpose
after
her
visitor
was
gone
laurette
looked
over
the
shipping
news
in
the
and
found
that
the
had
not
left
williamstown
till
eleven
o
clock
on
the
previous
night
langdale
s
name
was
safe
in
the
passenger
list
but
what
if
the
delay
had
led
to
a
chance
encounter
between
himself
and
stella
if
she
and
dora
had
gone
shopping
in
collins
street
as
not
infrequently
happens
with
young
ladies
late
in
the
afternoon
laurette
put
the
conjecture
from
her
she
was
somehow
upheld
by
the
thought
that
her
efforts
at
putting
crooked
things
straight
would
not
be
so
ruthlessly
crushed
by
an
overruling
providence
laurette
thoroughly
believed
that
this
power
was
always
on
the
side
of
the
strongest
battalions
and
as
matched
against
stella
laurette
felt
that
at
this
juncture
she
was
as
one
armed
and
lying
in
ambush
to
trap
an
unsuspecting
foe
as
some
of
the
lowest
organisms
in
which
nerves
can
not
exist
are
yet
somehow
sensitive
to
light
so
even
the
least
noble
natures
when
contriving
a
great
baseness
against
a
are
often
dimly
conscious
of
remorse
but
few
have
ever
practised
treacherous
artifices
with
less
compunction
than
visited
laurette
at
this
crisis
she
had
never
known
anything
of
those
delicate
instincts
of
morality
which
are
motive
powers
in
many
minds
that
have
received
far
less
moral
culture
she
had
many
impulses
of
generosity
and
kindness
but
they
were
rudimentary
florets
that
never
blossomed
into
habit
of
principles
she
knew
nothing
beyond
a
determination
to
make
the
best
of
her
get
all
she
could
out
of
life
she
would
never
transgress
the
rules
of
outward
decorum
nor
know
anything
of
the
better
aspirations
of
human
nature
she
was
now
threatened
with
social
extinction
and
her
insatiable
thirst
for
pleasure
and
ease
and
the
footing
she
had
gained
in
society
urged
her
to
make
a
desperate
struggle
using
such
means
as
lay
within
her
grasp
as
little
checked
by
any
feeble
glimmering
of
conscience
as
a
street
urchin
when
he
sucks
an
orange
and
throws
the
rind
away
and
yet
with
all
this
she
had
an
inimitable
trick
of
assigning
even
to
herself
virtuous
motives
to
the
shadiest
of
her
shady
little
intrigues
it
is
not
only
stella
who
must
be
protected
from
an
entanglement
with
a
married
man
she
reflected
but
then
there
is
ted
and
there
is
talbot
whose
movements
i
must
watch
a
husband
and
father
must
not
be
left
to
the
wiles
of
a
wretched
little
actress
at
a
crisis
i
shall
have
that
fifteen
hundred
pounds
after
all
for
if
i
know
anything
of
stella
courtland
the
letter
she
is
to
get
morning
will
set
fire
to
her
pride
in
a
way
that
will
put
things
in
a
new
light
and
her
had
no
idea
she
had
so
much
of
it
till
her
brother
got
find
he
hurried
away
without
even
seeing
to
a
living
wife
it
must
succeed
she
said
half
aloud
as
she
went
over
the
main
features
of
the
affair
xxxix
then
you
did
not
care
very
much
for
the
play
last
night
miss
stella
said
tareling
at
breakfast
on
the
following
morning
tell
me
what
you
objected
to
i
had
no
choice
of
dislike
answered
stella
i
thought
the
whole
of
it
was
overgrown
with
the
scurf
of
sort
of
thing
that
gets
acted
because
of
the
permanent
stupidity
of
our
goodness
i
feel
quite
annoyed
that
i
enjoyed
it
so
much
said
laurette
with
mock
humility
i
wouldn
t
if
i
were
you
answered
her
husband
with
a
laugh
in
a
democratic
country
you
are
always
right
if
you
are
on
the
side
of
the
majority
but
come
now
miss
stella
weren
t
you
a
little
touched
by
the
despair
of
the
lovers
there
was
a
big
woman
in
a
purple
satin
dress
near
me
who
mopped
her
eyes
till
her
handkerchief
dripped
you
have
found
their
despair
despair
echoed
stella
why
a
marionette
wouldn
t
be
imposed
upon
by
such
a
paltry
device
they
were
engaged
in
the
first
act
it
would
never
do
to
let
them
be
married
in
the
fact
the
play
would
not
come
into
what
would
then
become
of
the
worthy
fathers
of
families
who
are
supported
by
the
drama
so
of
course
there
must
be
a
misunderstanding
through
six
or
seven
scenes
oh
yes
it
might
melt
a
heart
of
stone
to
see
a
female
rouged
up
to
the
eyes
weeping
bitterly
without
shedding
any
tears
did
you
see
how
she
held
her
handkerchief
so
as
not
to
brush
the
powder
off
her
nose
i
am
sorry
i
didn
t
show
you
my
big
woman
in
the
purple
satin
she
wept
for
herself
and
both
the
lovers
said
tareling
looking
very
much
amused
but
i
suppose
you
will
admit
that
misunderstandings
do
come
between
even
your
shakespeare
makes
a
man
smother
his
wife
because
of
groundless
jealousy
said
laurette
who
had
taken
up
a
morning
paper
and
glanced
over
it
yes
and
with
such
a
fiend
incarnate
as
iago
to
poison
his
mind
he
could
not
have
been
othello
without
being
driven
into
laurette
was
glancing
over
the
paper
but
there
was
something
restless
and
nervous
in
her
manner
then
what
would
you
consider
a
sufficient
reason
for
an
estrangement
in
a
modern
play
oh
i
can
not
say
i
imagine
if
people
really
love
each
other
nothing
that
another
could
say
or
do
would
estrange
them
unless
there
is
an
iago
in
the
case
and
such
a
man
is
much
rarer
than
a
grand
passion
put
in
tareling
ah
miss
stella
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
very
charming
colour
this
she
turned
on
him
and
parried
the
insinuation
with
a
laughing
radiant
face
i
don
t
think
i
can
quite
forgive
you
for
not
showing
me
the
woman
who
wept
so
copiously
when
the
despairing
lovers
could
not
even
move
a
muscle
how
the
sight
would
have
consoled
me
letters
were
brought
in
several
for
stella
among
them
she
discerned
one
addressed
in
a
handwriting
the
sight
of
which
made
her
heart
throb
stormily
laurette
was
trembling
with
excitement
she
had
opened
a
letter
but
instead
of
reading
it
she
looked
over
it
furtively
at
stella
whose
face
at
that
moment
was
irradiated
as
if
a
rosy
flame
shone
through
lips
slightly
parted
in
a
happy
smile
her
eyes
lustrous
as
stars
the
honourable
talbot
tareling
s
home
correspondence
was
chiefly
of
the
kind
that
takes
the
disgustingly
prosaic
form
of
requesting
which
as
a
rule
rouse
neither
enthusiasm
nor
curiosity
in
the
recipient
s
breast
tareling
turned
over
his
with
an
air
of
profound
indifference
then
he
glanced
from
his
wife
s
face
to
stella
s
with
an
expression
of
curious
inquiry
laurette
caught
the
look
and
coloured
violently
instantly
taking
refuge
in
her
open
letter
it
is
evident
that
i
shall
have
to
spend
part
of
the
morning
at
my
desk
said
stella
rising
and
gathering
up
her
letters
please
remember
we
are
due
at
joran
s
in
the
afternoon
said
laurette
who
is
he
asked
her
husband
as
the
door
closed
after
stella
laurette
pretended
not
to
understand
oh
aren
t
you
behind
the
scenes
then
a
young
lady
does
not
colour
like
aurora
because
a
handful
of
letters
come
from
the
family
circle
and
such
a
dewy
smile
ye
gods
what
it
must
be
to
be
a
girl
and
in
love
the
girl
has
a
lovely
face
oh
probably
there
was
a
letter
from
ted
returned
laurette
trying
to
speak
carelessly
tareling
looked
at
her
narrowly
and
then
gave
a
short
laugh
fancy
a
girl
like
stella
colouring
up
to
the
whites
of
her
eyes
and
smiling
timidly
because
she
got
one
of
ritchie
s
croppy
epistles
you
are
sometimes
too
funny
laurette
what
is
your
little
game
now
a
sickening
fear
shot
across
laurette
s
mind
she
knew
that
in
the
decorums
of
life
in
which
she
herself
was
founded
as
on
a
rock
her
husband
scarcely
knew
the
draping
of
virtue
s
garment
but
it
was
also
equally
clear
to
her
that
if
he
knew
a
third
part
of
her
little
game
in
this
instance
he
would
overwhelm
her
with
anger
and
scorn
and
unsparing
exposure
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
stella
might
appear
at
any
moment
denouncing
the
palpable
treachery
that
had
been
practised
on
her
but
there
was
no
tremor
of
fear
in
her
voice
as
she
answered
ted
is
a
dreadful
cub
isn
t
he
except
when
he
signs
cheques
that
may
be
treated
as
blank
ones
it
appears
to
me
you
are
acquiring
a
habit
of
repeating
yourself
of
course
a
man
doesn
t
expect
to
be
amused
in
a
with
his
wife
t
you
think
you
might
hit
on
a
variation
laurette
did
not
permit
herself
to
attempt
a
reply
indeed
to
do
her
justice
it
was
only
at
periods
of
unusual
strain
or
irritation
that
she
so
far
tested
how
bitter
and
unalloyed
are
the
dregs
of
a
contract
entered
upon
for
life
with
out
love
or
mutual
respect
when
the
advantages
which
were
the
governing
motive
seem
to
be
gradually
becoming
less
when
stella
entered
her
own
room
she
stood
for
a
moment
by
the
open
window
that
soft
rapture
still
kindling
her
face
with
which
a
woman
receives
the
first
that
are
precious
to
her
she
opened
it
and
after
the
first
strange
unreal
moments
sank
in
a
chair
covering
her
eyes
as
if
to
shut
out
a
sight
too
terrible
to
be
looked
upon
again
and
again
she
forced
herself
to
read
over
the
words
mechanically
at
the
age
of
while
still
a
medical
student
in
london
just
a
year
after
my
father
s
death
i
met
a
lady
a
good
many
years
older
than
myself
who
fascinated
me
greatly
she
was
an
italian
and
very
beautiful
still
infatuated
as
i
was
i
shrank
from
the
idea
of
marrying
her
but
under
circumstances
which
i
need
not
now
detail
i
married
her
four
months
after
we
first
met
the
marriage
turned
out
a
disastrous
here
there
were
several
lines
completely
effaced
and
then
on
these
conditions
i
settled
an
income
on
her
which
she
named
as
being
adequate
and
was
to
be
paid
through
my
lawyer
the
letter
i
opened
in
the
home
field
that
day
was
from
my
lawyer
he
wrote
to
say
that
three
more
lines
were
the
lady
to
whom
the
money
was
payable
had
after
this
two
had
been
bodily
left
out
by
laurette
and
the
which
concluded
bore
only
the
signature
all
the
writing
that
preceded
it
having
been
obliterated
and
yet
not
wholly
looking
closely
three
lines
at
the
close
could
be
made
out
your
timorous
confession
that
you
felt
you
could
have
moved
or
spoken
after
your
accident
when
i
reached
you
only
you
wished
to
know
how
it
would
really
affect
me
then
the
concluding
terms
were
obliterated
also
but
the
name
anselm
langdale
was
clear
and
distinct
then
there
was
a
sheet
of
paper
which
was
evidently
part
of
a
letter
you
are
entirely
in
error
in
every
particular
regarding
your
wife
return
as
quickly
as
possible
and
all
these
miserable
misunderstandings
will
be
explained
and
set
right
you
need
not
hesitate
nor
imagine
that
you
will
be
asked
to
believe
this
merely
on
bare
assertion
proofs
are
forthcoming
as
to
the
rumour
of
death
it
is
as
as
the
first
mistakes
but
your
absence
has
reduced
my
poor
friend
to
such
a
state
of
despair
that
she
is
too
indifferent
to
take
even
the
slightest
trouble
do
not
lose
any
time
after
getting
this
return
to
her
and
all
will
yet
be
when
a
great
blow
suddenly
falls
on
one
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
at
first
coherent
thought
is
possible
the
throbbing
temples
the
parched
throat
and
flickering
vision
the
slow
dull
cold
beating
of
the
heart
make
the
physical
anguish
as
pressing
as
the
mental
suffering
then
the
creeping
stupor
that
succeeds
the
swift
exhaustion
of
all
the
faculties
paralyzes
coherent
thought
it
is
as
though
all
the
powers
of
the
mind
and
body
were
concentrated
in
sullenly
keeping
hold
on
and
hopeless
as
it
has
been
made
in
a
few
wild
incredible
moments
cold
and
trembling
in
every
limb
stella
cowered
by
the
window
over
these
fragmentary
sentences
every
feature
that
under
other
circumstances
would
have
thrown
discredit
on
these
strange
communications
was
even
at
the
first
glance
a
strong
link
in
a
chain
of
crushing
evidence
here
there
was
no
perhaps
it
was
a
bald
commonplace
little
story
an
unhappy
early
separation
years
ago
then
the
news
of
his
wife
s
death
that
was
the
letter
he
read
out
in
the
home
field
that
happy
spring
god
how
long
how
long
ago
she
seemed
to
see
herself
through
the
lapse
of
gray
years
out
in
the
sunshine
with
the
birds
singing
all
round
and
her
heart
leaping
with
a
sudden
passion
of
joy
as
anselm
asked
leave
in
a
broken
voice
to
write
to
her
from
the
other
side
of
the
world
she
went
over
all
that
faintly
now
and
again
as
her
breath
failed
her
already
all
the
rapture
and
bounding
hope
and
insane
gladness
were
part
of
an
unreal
fable
she
turned
to
his
letter
written
the
day
after
they
parted
she
knew
it
by
heart
she
had
read
it
the
last
thing
at
night
and
had
wakened
up
with
the
first
faint
approach
of
day
to
read
it
again
then
this
letter
had
come
to
him
no
wonder
he
wrote
in
a
disjointed
halting
fashion
blotting
out
almost
as
much
as
remained
and
closing
abruptly
where
was
he
now
oh
she
must
see
him
she
opened
a
letter
from
louise
and
near
the
beginning
of
the
letter
she
read
you
will
of
course
have
seen
langdale
before
he
sailed
on
the
was
two
days
back
why
had
not
the
letter
reached
her
before
ah
he
had
taken
precautions
would
it
not
have
been
kinder
to
see
her
when
this
torturing
revelation
was
to
be
did
he
understand
her
too
well
did
he
know
that
she
would
have
thrown
herself
at
his
feet
and
implored
him
not
to
leave
to
believe
this
woman
who
urged
his
return
merciful
heaven
what
frantic
thoughts
were
these
would
she
indeed
have
been
so
lost
to
pride
and
maidenly
reticence
she
went
and
confronted
herself
in
the
but
the
face
she
met
eyes
like
those
of
a
creature
trapped
and
wounded
to
her
turn
away
shuddering
he
was
gone
he
had
found
it
possible
to
leave
without
one
more
look
or
word
though
they
were
never
to
meet
again
there
was
something
in
this
that
wounded
her
beyond
endurance
and
he
had
not
made
one
allusion
to
her
long
letter
perhaps
it
was
wiser
wiser
yes
repeated
the
word
as
if
trying
to
understand
it
she
felt
dimly
that
to
her
wisdom
prudence
or
caution
were
but
empty
in
face
of
this
overwhelming
calamity
how
could
she
have
looked
at
him
and
borne
the
it
is
for
the
last
time
yes
he
had
been
wise
and
reasonable
as
for
her
she
could
not
have
left
him
thus
if
ten
thousand
obstacles
had
stood
between
them
ah
yes
he
understood
the
wild
passion
of
which
her
nature
was
capable
sometimes
she
walked
up
and
down
the
room
at
other
times
she
stood
staring
out
of
the
window
trying
to
recall
what
she
had
been
thinking
of
and
so
the
hours
wore
on
to
noon
then
there
was
a
tap
at
her
door
and
maisie
came
in
asking
something
about
a
dress
oh
miss
stella
she
suddenly
cried
out
in
dismay
as
she
looked
full
in
her
mistress
s
face
waiting
for
an
answer
which
did
not
come
there
s
ill
s
ill
news
is
it
from
fairacre
dear
miss
stella
cried
the
maid
overcome
with
terror
at
the
white
impassive
face
is
little
faintness
murmured
stella
it
was
all
over
and
the
world
swept
on
as
usual
and
she
had
somehow
to
face
the
lie
that
life
still
went
on
with
her
maisie
bathed
her
face
and
hands
and
stood
fanning
her
by
the
open
window
she
was
still
half
fearful
that
the
news
of
some
catastrophe
had
wrought
this
sudden
when
she
saw
that
her
mistress
shed
no
tears
she
was
reassured
maisie
fortunately
had
no
knowledge
of
those
stabs
which
are
so
deadly
that
they
bleed
but
little
outwardly
you
were
to
go
out
in
the
afternoon
miss
i
doubt
you
suldna
said
maisie
who
in
moments
of
agitation
returned
on
her
mother
s
accent
and
phrases
with
curious
fidelity
oh
don
t
speak
so
loud
maisie
and
then
stella
forced
herself
to
open
the
fairacre
letters
and
read
bits
of
them
to
maisie
who
at
once
became
certain
as
she
listened
that
all
was
well
there
were
honeybirds
in
swarms
in
the
especially
the
botanic
park
all
during
the
spring
the
torrens
was
determined
so
alice
wrote
not
to
give
up
running
and
singing
as
it
went
till
stella
returned
the
roses
were
extraordinarily
fine
this
season
especially
stella
s
favourite
white
fairy
and
macartney
the
girl
dropped
the
letter
with
a
little
miserable
moan
then
she
compelled
herself
to
read
on
weighty
changes
were
imminent
in
the
old
home
felix
harrison
had
won
so
many
distinctions
of
late
and
his
income
showed
so
liberal
a
margin
over
former
years
that
he
and
allie
were
to
be
married
at
christmas
then
tom
was
also
an
accepted
lover
and
there
was
not
a
single
reason
forthcoming
why
their
wedding
should
be
delayed
can
you
fancy
only
you
and
mother
in
the
old
home
wrote
allie
you
would
have
to
see
all
the
visitors
that
came
instead
of
retreating
to
the
library
you
spoilt
child
but
no
esther
and
the
children
will
share
the
old
home
with
you
it
is
time
clem
went
to
after
all
no
one
expects
you
to
linger
long
in
the
paternal
nest
oh
you
monkey
what
secrets
have
you
not
kept
from
me
she
crushed
the
letter
into
the
there
was
the
maid
still
waiting
an
answer
thank
you
maisie
i
must
write
some
letters
the
velvet
oh
any
way
you
she
was
left
she
tried
to
read
no
more
of
her
letters
just
then
she
was
stunned
insensible
though
not
unconscious
there
is
a
kind
of
moral
syncope
which
falls
on
the
heart
and
brain
after
the
first
shock
of
a
great
calamity
a
sort
of
lethargy
crept
over
stella
in
which
no
thought
no
feeling
was
acutely
present
she
read
the
words
over
repeatedly
till
she
could
have
said
them
by
heart
she
could
so
well
understand
those
stern
avoidance
of
all
empty
words
of
regret
and
then
the
lines
at
the
close
which
had
been
so
hurriedly
blotted
that
the
forms
of
the
letters
were
still
traceable
caught
her
attention
your
timorous
confession
that
you
felt
you
could
have
moved
or
spoken
after
your
accident
when
i
reached
you
only
you
wished
to
know
how
it
would
affect
me
her
heart
gave
a
strange
leap
and
the
blood
came
back
to
her
face
in
an
overflowing
wave
as
if
the
anguish
and
despair
that
held
her
did
not
fill
the
cup
of
her
supreme
agony
to
the
brim
she
saw
in
the
words
coupled
with
the
cold
bald
statement
that
preceded
them
a
record
of
langdale
s
consciousness
that
her
love
for
him
had
caused
the
avowal
of
his
when
he
had
meant
to
keep
silent
it
had
been
his
intention
to
sail
for
england
without
making
a
asking
leave
to
write
to
her
from
there
she
had
been
quite
happy
in
her
confidence
that
he
loved
her
even
before
his
avowal
oh
what
madness
when
the
mere
thought
that
he
cared
at
all
for
her
and
kept
silence
should
have
at
once
suggested
some
insuperable
obstacle
she
who
had
ever
been
so
ready
to
question
to
doubt
things
that
were
beyond
the
scope
of
human
knowledge
while
here
in
a
simple
matter
in
which
silence
was
in
itself
suspicion
ready
forged
she
had
found
no
cause
for
inquiry
for
a
moment
s
uneasiness
he
loved
her
he
did
not
wish
to
say
so
for
a
had
been
quite
enough
oh
fool
and
blind
that
she
had
been
to
give
her
love
before
it
was
to
see
no
peril
in
anything
so
long
as
she
knew
that
he
held
her
dear
he
had
loved
this
woman
once
then
that
he
had
made
his
wife
his
wife
shuddered
and
cowered
down
on
her
bed
as
if
seeking
to
hide
herself
and
then
she
rose
up
and
read
over
again
and
again
the
words
written
in
a
woman
s
fair
even
characters
on
the
face
of
them
the
writing
of
a
lady
all
will
yet
be
well
was
this
possible
would
he
perhaps
learn
that
he
had
been
in
the
wretchedness
of
the
marriage
had
been
caused
by
misunderstandings
on
which
light
would
be
now
thrown
would
he
be
thankful
that
the
rumour
of
her
death
was
untrue
would
he
perhaps
learn
to
love
her
oh
god
in
heaven
forbid
the
next
moment
she
was
thrilled
with
horror
at
the
imprecation
rather
but
no
quick
involuntary
horror
no
reasoning
could
hide
the
truth
which
forced
itself
on
the
thought
that
he
should
love
this
woman
was
even
more
torturing
than
the
knowledge
that
she
was
his
wife
should
not
this
in
itself
serve
to
loosen
the
dominion
of
this
passion
that
had
insidiously
rooted
itself
in
every
fibre
of
her
nature
she
satisfied
herself
that
he
had
really
sailed
every
hour
that
passed
widened
the
distance
between
him
nearer
to
her
who
might
win
his
love
the
thought
worked
like
poison
in
her
veins
she
threw
her
unread
letters
aside
she
put
away
out
of
sight
these
miserable
fragmentary
ones
that
had
brought
her
the
tidings
which
seemed
more
to
wreck
her
soul
than
her
the
envelope
with
its
firm
clear
writing
her
name
written
in
full
as
if
he
had
lingered
over
it
in
the
old
way
hurt
her
intolerably
and
his
ring
which
she
wore
next
her
heart
like
a
charm
with
its
noble
motto
now
the
bitterest
irony
all
that
was
best
and
highest
to
her
seemed
touched
with
this
mildew
of
mockery
yet
she
would
keep
this
to
the
day
of
her
death
when
the
world
was
mercifully
shrouded
in
oblivion
this
golden
amulet
would
lie
against
her
heart
while
all
its
stormy
throbbings
were
overpast
but
oh
merciful
heaven
what
a
long
and
weary
eternity
lay
between
she
had
come
to
one
of
those
epochs
that
arise
in
the
lives
of
women
who
have
souls
when
nothing
is
left
but
death
and
the
love
of
seemed
equally
remote
dustiefoot
who
had
patiently
waited
for
his
mistress
finding
that
she
did
not
come
as
usual
to
caress
and
talk
to
him
jumped
lightly
through
the
open
window
when
she
spoke
to
him
he
instantly
noticed
the
change
in
her
voice
and
looked
at
her
with
that
keen
almost
human
intelligence
in
his
eyes
which
langdale
had
once
compared
to
those
of
a
dog
painted
by
piero
di
cosimo
in
his
picture
of
the
death
of
procris
ah
those
endless
memories
each
thought
and
emotion
and
association
all
were
steeped
in
the
dye
of
those
days
which
seemed
to
hem
her
in
on
every
side
laurette
waited
in
almost
trembling
impatience
for
stella
s
appearance
she
did
not
leave
her
room
at
she
had
letters
to
write
and
could
not
eat
maisie
brought
her
some
tea
and
biscuits
for
dustiefoot
who
lay
at
his
mistress
s
feet
looking
up
in
her
face
from
time
to
time
with
watchful
solicitude
laurette
longed
to
go
into
her
know
in
what
way
the
letter
that
had
been
so
subtly
changed
had
wrought
if
she
takes
it
fighting
thought
laurette
i
shall
send
for
ted
this
very
four
o
clock
was
the
hour
at
which
they
were
to
leave
for
joran
s
a
few
minutes
before
that
time
stella
joined
her
hostess
in
the
faultlessly
dressed
a
damask
flush
on
her
cheeks
her
eyes
glistened
like
those
of
a
creature
that
has
been
dangerously
wounded
and
there
was
a
livid
aureole
round
them
but
beyond
this
and
a
curiously
toneless
timbre
of
voice
there
was
no
outward
sign
of
the
fierce
storm
which
had
swept
over
her
if
she
could
have
been
thankful
for
anything
at
that
time
it
would
have
been
that
no
one
knew
as
she
believed
of
the
disaster
which
had
overtaken
her
a
weight
seemed
to
press
on
her
head
and
voices
that
were
near
sounded
at
times
as
if
they
came
from
a
great
distance
her
lips
were
hot
and
parched
occasionally
a
shuddering
sigh
that
threatened
to
become
a
low
moan
roused
her
to
greater
vigilance
she
had
not
shed
a
tear
but
at
times
a
film
came
over
her
eyes
as
if
a
mist
fell
on
all
around
the
strain
of
bearing
such
torture
without
the
relief
of
solitude
or
rest
or
any
touch
of
gentle
resignation
as
to
an
inevitable
grief
was
cruel
in
the
extreme
but
it
seemed
to
induce
an
apathy
and
a
deadly
fatigue
so
that
sleep
came
to
her
almost
at
once
when
late
that
night
she
went
to
bed
she
slept
for
two
or
three
hours
and
then
she
woke
up
sobbing
uncontrollably
with
tearless
eyes
she
rose
up
and
lit
her
lamp
trembling
in
every
limb
there
was
an
unbearable
burning
weight
on
her
head
she
opened
her
desk
hardly
knowing
why
she
searched
for
those
fragmentary
letters
and
sat
down
going
over
every
word
afresh
the
thought
had
suddenly
lodged
in
her
mind
that
she
was
the
victim
of
some
strange
delusion
but
as
she
read
all
the
thoughts
and
events
of
the
past
day
came
crowding
back
the
contrast
between
the
overflowing
happiness
of
the
woman
who
had
opened
this
miserable
letter
and
the
stony
misery
which
had
fallen
on
her
fortunately
touched
the
source
of
tears
oh
my
lost
love
my
lost
love
she
moaned
and
the
tears
rained
down
and
blistered
the
paper
through
and
through
the
light
of
day
surprised
her
still
crouching
over
that
record
of
the
days
that
had
been
illuminated
with
a
light
now
quenched
in
the
darkness
of
despair
she
knew
that
the
loveliness
of
the
day
flooded
the
sky
with
its
accustomed
tenderness
and
splendour
but
she
shrank
from
the
sight
as
though
it
had
the
poison
of
asps
in
it
for
eyes
outworn
with
weeping
turn
where
she
would
she
saw
no
gleam
of
consolation
and
in
these
first
hours
of
intolerable
suffering
pain
and
anguish
were
more
hateful
to
her
than
they
had
ever
been
before
she
was
scorched
under
the
agony
that
had
fallen
on
her
as
a
flower
exposed
in
its
opening
freshness
is
shrivelled
by
a
furious
hot
wind
all
those
tendrils
of
hope
of
dawning
love
to
moments
of
exalted
consciousness
in
which
she
seemed
to
draw
closer
to
the
vivid
faith
that
had
once
kindled
her
put
to
flight
withered
and
entirely
slain
it
was
as
though
the
air
around
her
which
had
before
been
fanned
by
the
of
ethereal
hours
was
suddenly
darkened
by
the
sweep
of
vulture
wings
even
that
last
resource
of
an
unhappy
remembrance
of
happier
impossible
to
her
she
knew
that
for
her
these
days
had
been
the
flowering
point
of
her
life
but
as
for
him
was
it
more
than
a
brief
soon
to
be
forgotten
perhaps
in
a
happy
and
reconciliation
with
the
words
had
in
them
something
that
crushed
all
the
finer
tissues
of
thought
and
sensation
she
lay
hiding
her
face
from
the
light
quivering
at
times
from
head
to
foot
she
was
thankful
to
feel
that
apathy
creeping
over
her
that
comes
to
the
overstrained
mind
like
the
insensibility
of
muscles
which
have
been
severely
bruised
or
scalded
she
rose
at
the
usual
hour
and
maisie
was
again
startled
at
the
sight
of
her
mistress
s
face
it
was
one
in
which
expression
played
so
large
a
part
that
the
absence
of
vivacity
and
light
of
a
quickly
mantling
colour
as
well
as
the
dark
rings
round
the
eyes
made
a
startling
change
indeed
miss
stella
i
doubt
but
we
should
get
away
home
sooner
than
you
spoke
of
this
place
doesna
agree
with
you
the
room
is
too
small
and
ye
miss
the
woods
and
the
birds
and
your
rides
wouldn
t
you
be
glad
ma
am
to
leave
for
fairacre
soon
stella
at
the
words
swiftly
realized
what
a
terror
the
thought
of
returning
to
her
peaceful
home
had
for
her
those
calm
mother
and
sister
who
had
lived
their
lives
who
had
passed
their
keenest
joys
and
sorrows
the
children
whose
lives
were
to
come
whose
life
was
made
up
of
sunshine
and
flowers
and
gentle
schooling
and
all
the
healthful
untroubled
influences
that
for
the
more
fortunate
bridge
the
isthmus
from
infancy
to
could
she
take
up
the
ravelled
threads
amongst
them
nature
and
books
and
the
sweet
serenity
of
home
all
had
become
equally
impossible
all
the
force
of
her
strong
complex
organization
rose
in
revolt
against
the
perspective
of
a
faded
insipid
existence
which
the
prospect
called
up
how
could
she
endure
that
faint
replica
of
life
with
those
agonizing
memories
in
the
background
birds
and
flowers
and
trees
and
running
water
the
dawn
of
day
and
the
music
of
childish
had
not
only
lost
their
enchantment
their
very
memories
were
barbed
with
fiery
of
a
past
which
had
worn
a
faint
simulacrum
of
happiness
before
the
keen
flame
of
love
had
breathed
on
her
and
transformed
her
being
what
were
they
all
now
to
persons
and
scenes
and
events
that
had
made
up
existence
links
in
an
inexorable
chain
that
bound
her
like
a
to
her
ineffectual
inept
post
in
the
world
when
life
itself
had
really
passed
from
her
grasp
oh
no
she
had
not
lost
all
affection
for
those
dear
but
they
could
do
without
her
and
she
could
do
without
them
for
a
time
she
must
throw
the
past
from
her
like
a
stained
chalice
emptied
of
all
the
wine
of
life
she
must
be
somewhere
in
the
stir
and
tumult
of
the
world
where
things
would
hold
her
and
draw
her
away
from
she
could
live
without
happiness
and
those
foolish
dreams
that
had
been
the
dearest
possession
of
her
soul
but
maybe
ye
would
like
to
stay
for
the
ball
oh
of
course
maisie
use
the
hard
brushes
for
my
hair
this
she
spoke
in
an
impatient
imperative
tone
which
surprised
the
maid
so
much
that
she
offered
no
further
suggestions
at
sight
of
her
pallid
face
in
the
glass
stella
sponged
her
cheeks
with
pungent
aromatic
vinegar
the
delicate
skin
responded
at
once
to
the
touch
and
her
determination
to
keep
at
bay
the
rising
sorrow
that
at
times
threatened
like
a
great
flood
to
sweep
all
embankments
into
its
whirling
eddies
kept
the
colour
in
her
cheeks
and
the
fire
in
her
eyes
only
four
more
days
till
our
ball
said
laurette
who
in
her
heart
had
ejaculated
a
fervent
little
thanksgiving
to
providence
at
sight
of
stella
entering
the
she
had
looked
so
deadly
weary
and
done
on
the
previous
night
fear
like
a
chilly
snake
had
lodged
in
laurette
s
bosom
that
the
girl
would
certainly
fall
i
think
miss
stella
you
had
better
come
with
me
for
a
riding
expedition
till
the
evening
of
the
ball
said
the
master
of
the
house
who
with
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
generally
cleared
out
on
the
days
immediately
preceding
such
festivities
but
i
thought
you
were
to
be
the
villain
in
joran
s
comedietta
night
answered
stella
with
a
faint
smile
ah
man
who
drugs
people
and
steals
surely
that
is
not
the
of
a
real
drug
and
steal
letters
merely
you
are
going
to
be
a
philanthropist
in
thank
heaven
she
believes
it
all
thought
laurette
do
you
know
miss
stella
that
sounds
a
little
misanthropical
for
one
who
gets
letters
in
but
how
should
i
know
it
would
be
a
boon
from
the
gods
to
have
them
stolen
if
i
did
not
get
a
few
still
you
would
not
like
them
all
stolen
he
could
not
help
watching
her
a
little
curiously
there
was
some
inexplicable
change
in
her
whole
face
and
bearing
since
she
had
sat
in
the
same
place
hours
ago
he
saw
that
notwithstanding
her
effort
to
keep
an
indifferent
smiling
look
her
face
hardened
and
he
hastened
to
change
the
conversation
are
you
going
to
fall
into
plan
of
getting
you
for
the
heroine
of
her
little
adaptation
from
the
french
no
i
think
not
one
s
own
little
part
in
life
gives
me
so
many
without
dabbling
in
other
people
thank
god
she
is
in
a
fighting
mood
thought
laurette
i
am
sorry
consulted
me
and
i
told
her
i
thought
her
idea
was
an
inspiration
as
you
constantly
remind
me
of
a
cousin
of
my
own
of
whom
a
french
diplomat
once
said
that
she
had
a
parisian
edge
to
her
mind
she
had
too
as
he
said
that
vivacity
ses
moindres
which
englishwomen
so
rarely
possessed
she
had
in
fact
an
infusion
of
irish
blood
as
you
have
of
wasn
t
shocked
at
the
mention
of
anything
parisian
in
connection
with
stella
you
never
told
the
funny
story
ted
was
laughing
about
once
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
he
turned
up
this
remark
seemed
to
be
addressed
to
the
teapot
more
than
to
anyone
in
particular
but
shearing
is
in
full
swing
at
strathhaye
said
tareling
who
instantly
connected
this
announcement
with
stella
s
presence
and
began
vaguely
to
speculate
whether
after
all
there
was
anything
in
it
women
were
such
queer
could
never
tell
how
many
impossible
marriages
he
tareling
had
seen
in
his
day
but
australian
girls
were
not
as
a
rule
so
keenly
alive
to
the
fascinations
of
wealth
as
those
inoculated
with
the
aims
and
standard
of
london
society
where
to
lack
money
was
to
be
out
of
the
swim
of
everything
that
held
life
together
that
same
lady
mary
his
cousin
who
in
tareling
s
memory
held
the
shadowy
place
of
what
might
have
been
who
had
at
times
scolded
him
and
somehow
got
him
out
of
his
first
serious
scrape
at
eton
and
written
him
letters
and
promised
to
marry
him
if
a
chinese
mandarin
left
him
a
mine
in
golconda
whose
radiant
gray
eyes
and
brilliant
sallies
had
often
been
recalled
by
stella
a
strange
hash
she
had
made
of
her
life
first
marrying
the
wrong
man
then
running
away
with
the
wrong
one
and
finally
taking
the
wrong
dose
of
chloral
would
she
have
fared
so
very
much
worse
if
she
had
married
him
though
they
were
both
as
poor
as
church
mice
with
something
less
than
nine
hundred
a
year
between
them
and
no
one
likely
to
leave
them
a
mine
in
golconda
she
in
her
dishonoured
he
in
his
dishonoured
life
gambling
and
drinking
deep
at
times
and
playing
the
generally
in
society
at
the
far
ends
of
the
earth
sponging
on
his
wife
s
relations
as
old
ritchie
had
once
said
in
a
fury
after
he
had
been
called
on
to
shell
out
a
thousand
pounds
or
so
to
keep
a
very
shady
story
from
the
light
of
day
probably
they
would
have
quarrelled
and
to
quarrel
in
one
of
those
tiny
establishments
in
which
people
lived
on
nine
hundred
a
year
was
the
very
had
to
get
down
so
completely
to
hard
be
a
plumb
idiot
the
next
moment
and
kiss
and
be
friends
he
rather
thought
they
would
have
done
the
latter
but
at
any
rate
would
they
quite
have
come
to
this
she
in
a
nameless
grave
at
monte
married
to
a
colonial
heiress
intriguing
to
keep
a
firm
hold
among
the
mixed
lot
that
formed
the
in
a
pushing
vulgar
colonial
city
yet
even
lady
mary
s
marriage
lacked
some
of
the
utter
incongruity
that
would
attend
one
between
ritchie
and
this
young
woman
a
mammoth
scratched
on
a
bone
by
a
prehistoric
man
and
a
statuette
by
one
of
the
old
grecian
sculptors
that
was
what
would
represent
the
comparative
quality
of
their
minds
tareling
was
not
a
man
who
had
retained
much
of
the
faculty
of
being
even
touched
by
the
higher
possibilities
of
human
life
he
would
have
had
to
purge
and
live
cleanly
before
he
could
be
the
moral
equal
of
many
among
those
he
contemptuously
classed
as
a
mixed
whatever
semblance
of
the
hero
had
once
lived
in
his
heart
had
long
since
atrophied
his
aims
and
ideals
were
to
the
full
as
ignoble
as
those
of
that
lower
division
of
the
common
herd
who
value
money
chiefly
for
the
physical
excesses
and
mental
excitements
that
it
commands
yet
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
that
one
has
not
generations
of
and
cultured
people
behind
him
without
retaining
some
keenness
of
perception
that
belongs
to
a
creature
whether
he
be
man
horse
or
dog
stella
interested
him
not
only
because
of
the
resemblance
he
fancied
in
her
to
the
unhappy
girl
who
in
her
brilliant
youth
had
been
so
much
his
friend
but
also
because
of
that
element
of
personal
fascination
which
is
inseparable
from
some
women
why
had
the
glow
and
the
sparkle
of
her
face
been
suddenly
quenched
why
those
livid
circles
round
the
eyes
that
did
not
in
the
least
respond
to
the
smile
she
called
up
you
will
be
glad
to
have
some
riding
stella
no
doubt
ted
will
bring
a
hack
or
two
a
lady
can
ride
said
laurette
emboldened
by
the
inferences
she
drew
from
observing
the
girl
to
handle
her
subject
like
a
lad
of
she
began
to
think
that
stella
after
all
was
not
such
a
very
bad
sort
of
nettle
to
manage
would
you
like
to
ride
said
tareling
suddenly
but
it
seemed
there
were
too
many
engagements
of
one
sort
or
another
indeed
if
there
had
not
been
such
laurette
would
have
invented
them
no
one
allowed
himself
to
be
more
easily
hoodwinked
than
talbot
when
it
suited
him
but
on
the
other
hand
no
one
had
a
more
unerring
vision
in
piecing
broken
hints
into
a
whole
once
his
suspicion
or
interest
was
thoroughly
roused
he
had
too
curious
tact
with
people
whom
laurette
herself
might
deceive
or
mislead
but
whose
confidence
she
could
never
win
she
could
see
by
the
way
he
glanced
under
his
heavy
eyelids
from
herself
to
stella
that
something
had
presented
itself
to
him
as
a
problem
oh
it
will
be
delightful
to
ride
stella
said
looking
up
with
a
faint
flush
rising
on
her
face
the
word
delightful
had
a
sardonic
ring
in
her
ears
but
language
can
not
serve
its
purpose
as
legal
tender
between
beings
whose
first
care
often
is
that
nothing
of
what
surges
most
vividly
in
the
mind
should
pass
into
speech
without
at
times
sounding
in
the
ears
like
a
mocking
echo
xl
ritchie
arrived
at
monico
lodge
on
the
forenoon
of
the
next
day
laurette
met
him
in
the
hall
and
drew
him
into
the
yes
stella
is
in
she
is
in
the
she
said
in
answer
to
her
brother
s
eager
inquiries
but
ted
i
am
in
despair
i
absolutely
do
not
know
what
to
think
heaven
knows
if
ever
a
woman
tried
to
serve
a
brother
as
i
well
what
s
in
the
wind
fresh
oh
goodness
only
knows
when
she
came
she
was
in
almost
wild
spirits
one
would
say
she
counted
the
moments
till
you
came
now
she
ain
t
so
jolly
well
that
is
stella
all
over
what
is
there
to
wonder
at
in
that
hurry
up
larry
if
you
ve
got
anything
to
say
i
am
famishing
to
see
only
this
ted
feel
your
way
cautiously
and
whatever
you
do
don
t
breathe
a
word
of
anything
i
said
to
you
before
you
went
to
of
course
told
you
before
i
wouldn
t
answered
ted
impatiently
but
look
here
larry
you
re
a
trump
to
take
so
much
trouble
on
my
oh
if
one
could
only
be
sure
of
her
but
one
day
to
be
full
of
hope
and
all
smooth
sailing
and
the
laurette
gave
a
deep
sigh
as
if
she
were
in
the
depths
of
perplexity
then
ted
made
his
escape
into
the
well
stella
are
you
still
cross
with
me
he
said
gently
holding
her
hand
no
i
think
not
she
said
with
a
wan
smile
endeavouring
to
recollect
the
reason
why
she
should
cherish
offence
everything
was
so
incredibly
misty
at
times
so
far
away
and
indifferent
the
days
seemed
to
stretch
on
and
on
like
eternity
three
had
not
yet
passed
since
the
morning
on
which
she
opened
that
letter
with
its
pitiless
tidings
yet
the
most
remote
epoch
of
her
life
seemed
to
be
the
days
in
which
supreme
happiness
was
neither
a
threat
nor
a
vague
possibility
but
a
secure
possession
and
now
it
was
all
over
with
nothing
left
but
those
recurring
periods
in
which
she
was
alive
in
every
nerve
to
the
horrible
misery
that
had
overtaken
in
which
she
seemed
to
see
nothing
but
a
ship
that
sailed
on
night
and
day
bearing
the
only
man
she
had
ever
loved
or
could
love
to
his
the
thought
stung
her
so
intolerably
that
she
often
rose
up
seeking
for
relief
in
motion
as
if
a
heavy
physical
load
crushed
her
which
she
must
endeavour
to
throw
off
ritchie
looked
into
her
face
with
startled
inquiry
what
ailed
her
was
it
possible
that
the
knowledge
which
laurette
said
had
partly
come
to
the
girl
should
give
her
so
much
pain
the
thought
touched
him
strongly
but
he
remembered
laurette
s
warning
he
might
interrupt
her
counsels
and
little
incipient
homilies
roughly
but
yet
no
one
else
could
help
him
so
much
nor
tell
so
well
what
motives
swayed
stella
i
don
t
believe
melbourne
agrees
with
you
one
bit
he
said
still
holding
her
hand
which
she
left
passively
in
his
no
perhaps
not
and
yet
i
don
t
want
to
go
back
to
they
stood
side
by
side
in
the
she
looking
out
with
heavy
tired
eyes
at
the
scrubby
little
trees
and
that
decorated
the
grounds
of
monico
lodge
but
seeing
nought
of
all
that
was
around
her
where
would
you
like
to
go
stella
said
ritchie
slowly
his
breath
came
fast
but
some
instinct
warned
him
to
keep
down
his
rising
joy
oh
i
don
t
know
i
where
i
would
not
see
these
woods
and
skies
to
the
far
ends
of
the
stella
let
me
take
you
wherever
you
would
like
to
go
it
s
all
i
ve
got
to
live
or
care
he
was
looking
eagerly
into
her
face
and
suddenly
saw
a
gray
paleness
creeping
over
it
all
became
dim
around
her
she
put
her
hands
out
like
one
groping
in
the
dark
he
passed
his
arm
round
her
and
for
a
moment
her
head
fell
on
his
shoulder
her
face
was
like
that
of
one
dead
and
its
pallor
terrified
him
but
she
did
not
entirely
lose
consciousness
how
dark
it
has
grown
she
said
in
a
faint
whisper
it
will
soon
be
light
again
stella
answered
ted
hardly
knowing
what
he
said
the
profound
sadness
of
her
face
and
her
sudden
unaccountable
weakness
smote
him
to
the
heart
stella
has
anything
happened
that
hurts
you
is
there
anything
in
the
world
i
can
do
for
you
his
voice
trembled
and
he
tried
to
draw
her
nearer
to
him
this
roused
her
and
sighing
heavily
once
or
twice
she
disengaged
herself
and
sat
on
the
seat
that
ran
round
the
window
ritchie
s
presence
had
recalled
with
a
paroxysm
of
acute
agony
all
that
lay
between
now
and
their
last
parting
such
moments
of
overpowering
pain
were
succeeded
by
hours
that
were
passed
rather
than
felt
the
intolerable
edge
of
suffering
was
gradually
for
the
time
blunted
apathy
put
a
foil
on
grief
and
robbed
memory
of
its
piercing
barbs
in
the
reaction
ted
s
familiar
voice
and
unswerving
devotion
soothed
nay
even
reassured
her
her
stern
proud
had
not
broken
down
before
anyone
till
now
and
with
her
came
the
thought
that
he
had
claims
on
her
she
had
once
consented
to
be
his
wife
but
her
heart
had
rebelled
against
a
marriage
without
the
quickening
pulse
of
love
and
tender
mutual
sympathy
now
she
knew
that
these
were
forever
sealed
against
her
the
glow
and
romance
of
youth
were
over
she
had
loved
and
lost
but
the
years
could
not
be
thrown
aside
like
a
stupid
story
she
had
dreamed
a
dream
of
life
and
it
was
over
but
existence
still
remained
to
be
got
through
stella
we
have
been
friends
since
we
were
little
children
you
do
care
a
little
for
me
be
my
wife
she
heard
the
voice
so
long
familiar
pleading
with
her
brokenly
and
it
touched
her
in
that
strange
hour
as
it
had
never
touched
her
before
the
thought
welled
up
strongly
in
her
heart
this
love
is
to
him
what
mine
was
to
one
great
affection
of
his
life
in
this
was
centred
the
keenest
possibilities
of
his
the
very
depth
of
her
own
suffering
and
infinite
loneliness
moved
her
to
compassionate
sympathy
she
had
almost
forgotten
him
in
the
brief
triumphant
days
of
her
joy
but
no
one
had
ever
usurped
her
place
with
him
could
she
now
confer
on
him
the
boon
that
was
so
priceless
in
his
which
he
had
so
long
pleaded
and
for
herself
would
this
not
after
all
be
the
best
solution
of
the
cruel
enigma
into
which
existence
had
resolved
itself
the
old
home
life
full
of
leisure
and
calm
and
could
she
take
that
up
when
her
one
fierce
longing
was
to
forget
it
would
be
an
endless
stifling
life
in
death
in
which
the
weary
days
would
stretch
before
her
to
be
filled
only
with
bleeding
recollections
with
famished
imaginings
of
what
might
have
been
her
pursuits
and
meditations
there
would
touch
those
treacherous
springs
which
woke
all
the
cells
of
memory
and
flooded
her
being
with
unbearable
agony
with
the
wild
baleful
pangs
of
jealousy
yes
jealousy
unreasonable
uncontrollable
it
was
the
bitter
humiliation
of
this
that
stung
her
beyond
endurance
sorrow
in
any
other
form
she
might
have
this
scorched
her
degraded
her
bit
into
her
like
some
virulent
immaterial
poison
which
nourishes
the
blood
in
order
that
it
may
consume
the
soul
jealous
of
a
man
s
wife
these
were
the
words
that
came
to
her
perpetually
more
venomous
than
the
hiss
of
a
serpent
a
marriage
in
which
some
kind
of
friendship
was
which
travel
movement
variety
were
open
to
was
the
least
objectionable
scheme
that
remained
to
her
ted
s
allegiance
was
so
exacted
so
little
he
watched
her
face
with
keen
emotion
stella
you
are
going
to
consent
he
said
drawing
near
to
her
but
she
drew
back
don
t
ted
you
must
not
be
affectionate
if
you
want
me
to
marry
ted
smiled
under
his
moustache
then
a
servant
came
to
announce
the
arrival
of
his
groom
with
the
horses
the
day
was
perfect
in
its
warm
serene
loveliness
the
sky
was
like
a
vast
bed
of
blue
hyacinths
bending
above
the
earth
with
angelic
benedictions
already
the
had
something
of
the
ardour
of
summer
heat
but
there
was
a
cool
southerly
breeze
and
a
recent
fall
of
rain
had
laid
the
dust
the
sight
of
the
sea
lying
as
calm
as
a
great
lake
its
bosom
glancing
in
silvery
sheaves
rather
than
waves
brought
back
to
stella
with
irresistible
vividness
the
memorable
ride
over
the
wide
peeloo
plain
a
great
wave
of
anguish
swept
over
her
afresh
in
which
it
seemed
as
if
she
must
call
aloud
to
find
some
relief
from
the
fierce
torment
so
great
was
the
agony
that
for
a
little
time
she
could
neither
hear
nor
see
oh
my
love
my
love
have
i
indeed
lost
you
were
the
words
that
rose
to
her
lips
for
a
moment
a
wild
revolt
rose
within
her
against
all
the
obstacles
that
could
part
them
on
the
wide
horizon
she
seemed
to
see
the
faint
film
of
smoke
which
a
great
steamer
leaves
as
it
speeds
on
its
way
to
the
old
world
all
will
yet
be
did
this
hope
animate
his
heart
did
he
perchance
count
the
hours
till
he
saw
her
those
proofs
were
given
him
of
faults
imputed
that
were
years
made
dark
with
undeserved
blame
would
a
fresher
stronger
bond
rise
up
in
place
of
the
old
unhappiness
would
he
learn
to
love
ah
what
a
pitiful
humiliated
creature
had
she
become
to
harbour
such
thoughts
hell
seemed
to
yawn
at
her
feet
when
she
found
her
heart
torn
with
savage
jealousy
as
these
thoughts
rose
in
quick
succession
the
riders
had
ridden
fast
and
dustiefoot
who
could
not
bear
to
lag
far
behind
his
mistress
panted
and
showed
such
signs
of
being
overdone
that
they
rode
back
slowly
will
you
take
him
with
you
on
your
travels
stella
asked
ted
who
watched
with
a
feeling
akin
to
envy
the
tenderness
with
which
stella
regarded
her
dog
on
my
travels
oh
yes
wherever
i
go
one
should
always
have
a
dog
to
keep
one
in
in
countenance
yes
most
human
creatures
remind
one
of
the
characters
in
an
old
morality
god
s
visitation
enter
time
who
maketh
people
weary
and
melancholy
with
a
similitude
of
rust
and
and
what
is
an
old
morality
stella
well
ted
you
really
must
go
to
she
laughed
and
the
sound
was
music
in
his
ears
though
it
was
a
strange
mirthless
little
laugh
yes
i
should
like
that
very
you
keep
school
and
take
just
one
scholar
where
would
you
begin
with
me
stella
how
many
books
have
you
read
heaven
only
knows
quite
enough
to
convince
me
that
i
do
not
know
o
jupiter
is
it
worth
while
learning
so
much
to
know
that
what
is
the
good
of
reading
so
many
dry
old
fogies
of
books
well
sometimes
it
makes
people
better
companions
for
themselves
but
other
times
it
makes
them
the
worst
of
all
company
i
i
read
very
slowly
if
it
is
a
dull
book
like
the
bible
and
poetry
i
forget
what
one
page
is
about
before
i
get
to
the
next
it
would
take
me
a
thundering
long
time
to
read
books
and
if
they
don
t
teach
me
much
in
the
end
and
make
me
worse
company
for
myself
why
we
ll
give
books
the
what
s
the
next
on
your
list
stella
i
haven
t
got
a
there
isn
t
a
next
ted
you
mustn
t
ask
me
questions
i
do
that
to
myself
endlessly
and
i
hate
them
there
are
no
answers
to
most
and
those
that
have
answers
are
what
questions
do
you
ask
yourself
there
i
ve
put
my
foot
in
it
again
well
look
here
stella
your
school
will
be
the
jolliest
affair
going
you
only
teach
reading
and
that
game
isn
t
worth
the
candle
so
there
i
ll
be
bright
and
early
and
nothing
to
learn
but
to
stay
with
you
but
i
ll
pick
up
a
lot
in
that
way
why
some
time
ago
i
put
the
stuns
on
a
fellow
with
just
only
remembering
that
the
line
where
is
the
land
to
which
yon
ship
must
go
is
in
one
of
wordsworth
s
sonnets
oh
he
s
just
a
racing
fellow
he
comes
from
one
of
the
old
swell
families
in
england
but
nothing
like
such
a
bad
lot
as
tareling
he
s
as
straight
as
a
die
and
never
borrows
money
and
he
s
quite
gone
on
books
though
he
took
his
degree
at
oxford
he
and
another
fellow
were
talking
about
poetry
in
the
after
dinner
at
the
club
the
last
time
i
was
in
town
and
the
other
fellow
asked
dacre
that
s
his
name
where
that
line
came
from
i
was
reading
the
sporting
part
of
the
but
the
words
came
on
me
like
seeing
you
unexpectedly
and
i
looked
up
and
said
why
that
s
from
one
of
wordsworth
s
sonnets
by
george
they
were
more
astonished
than
if
i
had
stood
on
my
head
yes
upon
my
soul
they
both
stared
as
if
they
had
paid
a
bob
to
see
me
why
ritchie
do
you
actually
read
sonnets
said
dacre
he
has
written
a
bookful
himself
he
is
one
of
those
fellows
who
think
that
all
men
write
poetry
when
they
are
spoony
i
could
tell
him
better
than
that
do
you
remember
stella
one
sunday
evening
when
i
was
staying
from
saturday
till
monday
at
fairacre
billy
stein
and
herby
lindsay
were
there
too
billy
knew
a
fearful
lot
of
german
stuff
that
you
were
always
fond
of
and
as
for
poetry
he
could
spout
it
by
the
hour
it
was
shortly
before
i
left
for
suppose
you
were
fifteen
at
the
used
sometimes
to
get
perfectly
wild
with
making
fun
of
one
thing
or
another
and
your
eyes
and
cheeks
and
lips
all
used
to
make
flashes
oh
you
may
laugh
but
i
know
what
i
mean
your
eyes
are
awfully
heavy
just
now
stella
well
you
put
the
four
of
us
in
a
and
me
and
the
other
you
wouldn
t
let
us
move
till
we
each
made
some
sort
of
verses
pon
my
soul
i
nearly
squirmed
my
eyes
out
trying
to
think
of
words
that
sounded
alike
when
i
did
get
any
the
spelling
was
out
and
there
was
that
little
beggar
billy
making
up
something
as
long
as
my
arm
about
a
rose
and
a
maiden
and
a
nightingale
but
i
put
the
kybosh
on
him
there
for
i
said
there
were
no
nightingales
in
australia
and
how
did
we
know
whether
they
sang
as
he
said
and
you
took
my
side
but
i
think
it
was
out
of
pure
wickedness
everyone
got
finished
long
before
i
did
and
at
the
end
i
could
only
make
up
four
lines
oh
i
remember
them
well
enough
a
lamb
s
tail
caught
on
a
rail
the
mother
humming
the
crow
stella
laughed
again
why
ted
you
are
one
of
the
dumb
poets
what
in
the
world
put
that
into
your
head
oh
don
t
suppose
i
made
up
the
adventure
i
took
it
from
life
i
saw
a
little
lunatic
of
a
lamb
caught
by
his
hind
end
before
he
was
tailed
and
if
i
hadn
t
taken
him
to
his
mother
the
old
crow
would
have
scooped
his
optics
out
in
no
time
you
all
objected
to
humming
i
didn
t
want
the
darned
sheep
to
hum
it
was
you
that
would
have
rhyme
and
how
could
you
make
bleating
into
poetry
there
i
very
nearly
got
into
a
scot
with
stein
he
kept
on
laughing
so
much
but
then
you
walked
with
me
up
to
the
spanish
reeds
and
showed
me
the
nest
of
a
superb
warbler
i
think
you
called
told
me
how
you
watched
the
old
mater
teaching
the
young
uns
to
fly
and
then
i
made
up
my
mind
to
ask
you
if
i
might
write
to
you
my
heart
beat
so
hard
i
thought
it
would
crack
and
you
said
quite
carelessly
oh
yes
ted
why
shouldn
t
you
i
couldn
t
have
told
why
it
gave
me
a
lump
in
the
throat
the
way
you
spoke
then
i
thought
that
little
wretch
billy
will
want
to
write
too
and
spin
away
about
nightingales
and
the
lord
knows
what
i
never
feel
such
a
duffer
as
i
do
when
i
take
a
pen
i
say
stella
did
you
ever
keep
any
of
my
letters
oh
yes
i
think
i
expect
you
ve
got
a
nice
pile
of
by
this
time
now
tell
me
there
any
of
them
you
like
better
than
mine
no
not
the
thought
welled
up
bitterly
of
the
letter
she
had
opened
with
such
insane
joy
three
short
days
ago
and
with
this
came
recollections
of
the
long
faithful
wooing
of
her
the
devotion
she
had
taken
as
carelessly
as
an
unset
pebble
and
yet
was
there
anything
in
the
world
more
rare
more
precious
these
reminiscences
of
her
untroubled
girlhood
touched
a
tender
chord
she
realized
that
a
love
which
had
its
roots
so
far
back
in
the
past
had
a
claim
on
her
loyalty
at
the
worst
it
was
less
humiliating
to
marry
a
man
without
loving
him
than
to
love
one
already
married
ted
watching
her
face
closely
noted
its
wistful
softening
expression
lookee
here
stella
he
burst
out
suddenly
i
am
going
to
run
away
with
you
you
will
be
cross
at
first
but
you
will
get
over
it
you
know
you
looked
as
if
you
could
not
speak
with
passion
when
i
held
you
that
night
and
asked
that
i
might
kiss
you
but
when
we
met
you
never
once
thought
of
bringing
it
up
against
me
now
did
you
oh
good
lord
stella
why
do
you
keep
me
on
and
on
hoping
and
nothing
come
of
it
put
an
end
to
it
you
want
to
get
away
you
need
a
complete
change
anyone
can
see
that
you
said
in
july
you
sometimes
thought
of
marrying
me
there
it
is
in
the
horses
hoofs
summer
autumn
winter
it
is
spring
now
we
won
t
have
the
smallest
morsel
of
fuss
if
we
were
married
everyone
would
say
well
goodness
knows
they
ve
been
long
enough
thinking
over
it
let
s
put
an
end
to
it
stella
hear
the
horses
hoofs
every
one
of
them
saying
yes
stella
will
you
marry
me
there
was
a
long
pause
the
sound
of
a
railway
whistle
in
the
distance
of
calling
as
they
skimmed
the
waves
the
deep
solemn
crescendo
of
the
wide
sea
as
it
broke
on
the
shining
sand
the
merry
cries
of
children
on
the
came
borne
to
them
on
the
balmy
spring
air
memories
that
had
a
pang
beyond
the
bitterness
of
death
surged
up
in
stella
s
mind
to
the
smallest
detail
the
hour
in
which
she
had
listened
in
speechless
happiness
to
anselm
langdale
s
avowal
of
love
rose
up
before
her
an
hour
so
near
in
in
the
sensations
that
turn
hours
into
years
remote
as
the
first
dawn
of
consciousness
answer
me
stella
said
ritchie
his
voice
now
low
and
husky
with
contending
emotion
don
t
you
know
what
to
say
it
s
very
yes
again
there
was
a
long
pause
yes
she
answered
at
last
and
ritchie
turned
quite
pale
through
the
ruddy
bronze
of
his
cheeks
for
a
moment
he
almost
reeled
in
his
saddle
and
doubted
his
senses
stella
do
you
mean
it
you
will
be
my
wife
yes
she
said
again
looking
into
his
face
he
was
agitated
almost
to
tears
while
she
was
perfectly
calm
they
rode
on
for
a
little
time
in
silence
something
like
rest
stole
over
stella
she
felt
that
her
course
was
now
fixed
her
decision
there
was
relief
in
the
thought
as
for
ritchie
he
almost
feared
to
give
complete
credence
to
the
belief
that
after
all
these
years
of
unavailing
waiting
and
was
in
truth
an
accepted
lover
and
even
he
elementary
human
being
though
he
might
be
in
one
of
stella
s
old
phrases
yet
experienced
that
quick
revulsion
which
so
often
sets
in
of
dread
because
of
other
possibilities
now
that
this
ardently
happiness
seemed
within
reach
but
as
the
first
tumult
of
thought
subsided
his
joy
rose
high
stella
you
have
said
no
so
long
you
must
keep
on
telling
me
it
s
all
right
now
he
said
in
unusually
timid
tones
i
can
hardly
believe
in
such
luck
for
don
t
be
too
glad
ted
if
you
are
you
re
sure
to
be
but
if
you
were
me
stella
you
couldn
t
help
being
too
glad
returned
ted
with
unconscious
pathos
something
in
the
words
struck
a
chord
in
stella
s
heart
she
felt
softened
and
remorseful
she
determined
that
as
far
as
in
her
lay
she
would
quench
the
rising
tide
of
hard
cold
indifference
of
scorn
for
her
own
life
and
action
which
was
the
first
result
of
her
momentous
decision
but
when
people
feel
one
way
and
make
resolutions
in
another
direction
it
is
a
with
circumstance
which
will
be
victor
in
the
first
or
subsequent
encounters
xli
when
they
reached
monico
lodge
there
was
cuthbert
at
the
door
going
away
after
having
waited
for
some
little
time
he
helped
stella
to
dismount
and
the
three
went
in
together
congratulate
me
my
dear
fellow
said
ted
the
moment
they
went
into
the
stella
has
promised
this
very
afternoon
to
be
my
this
time
there
is
to
be
no
drawing
the
brother
stared
at
ritchie
in
an
incredulous
way
and
then
at
his
sister
she
suddenly
coloured
deeply
and
said
yes
cuthbert
you
may
congratulate
us
but
we
are
going
away
almost
directly
so
as
to
escape
all
the
she
felt
compelled
to
talk
in
a
tone
so
as
to
save
herself
from
the
imbecility
of
tears
oh
yes
the
day
after
if
you
please
by
the
way
i
must
go
and
tell
believe
she
s
stella
darling
may
god
grant
you
every
happiness
said
her
brother
kissing
her
first
on
one
cheek
and
then
on
the
other
he
felt
a
pang
of
misgiving
which
he
could
not
conquer
and
his
face
and
voice
were
exceedingly
grave
now
cuthbert
don
t
be
so
any
rate
until
the
ultimate
but
you
are
attached
to
you
would
never
have
given
your
consent
oh
my
dear
it
is
unsafe
to
generalize
about
our
delightful
sex
don
t
you
remember
what
teresa
said
in
one
of
her
letters
to
a
carmelite
father
your
reverence
made
me
smile
by
saying
that
you
could
tell
her
character
so
well
but
we
women
are
not
so
easily
known
but
there
are
some
things
stella
it
would
be
safe
to
prognosticate
of
all
good
oh
yes
as
for
example
they
all
have
ten
fingers
and
have
learned
the
catechism
and
the
creed
but
if
it
comes
to
asserting
that
they
believe
the
one
and
remember
all
the
but
what
motive
could
or
would
be
strong
enough
with
you
darling
except
love
in
some
degree
ah
of
but
a
woman
must
not
give
her
love
till
it
is
asked
isn
t
that
one
of
the
demure
unwritten
statutes
well
i
am
so
very
proper
that
i
am
not
going
to
give
it
even
when
until
i
am
married
it
is
the
process
of
evolution
in
the
meantime
ted
vows
he
has
enough
for
oh
stella
you
pain
me
i
can
not
believe
you
would
look
and
speak
like
this
if
your
heart
were
really
now
cuth
you
know
very
well
if
my
heart
were
touched
i
would
be
dead
you
see
it
is
a
very
organ
as
it
is
if
it
went
through
all
the
impossible
gymnastics
ascribed
to
it
by
lovers
the
human
race
would
have
come
to
an
end
long
ago
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
perhaps
that
is
the
best
thing
that
could
you
are
not
well
dear
you
flush
up
feverishly
and
then
you
are
pale
with
dark
rings
about
the
eyes
you
looked
very
different
when
you
came
from
lull
dora
and
i
both
noticed
you
were
so
dear
and
tender
we
were
so
delighted
i
came
to
tell
you
stella
that
our
is
oh
is
it
because
if
so
ted
and
i
will
be
married
yes
i
m
determined
not
to
be
like
cinderella
left
with
the
cinders
when
you
go
straight
to
heaven
like
elijah
in
a
fiery
chariot
but
then
elijah
poor
man
had
no
well
stella
i
should
be
very
unhappy
if
the
girl
who
promised
to
marry
me
could
talk
like
you
the
day
she
was
engaged
that
reckless
mocking
girl
who
was
happy
could
use
unless
it
were
an
artifice
to
conceal
her
joy
said
stella
laughing
then
in
a
graver
tone
you
see
dear
it
does
not
do
to
generalize
too
largely
on
looking
round
among
our
married
friends
does
it
not
strike
you
that
the
majority
never
committed
the
indiscretion
of
falling
in
love
at
all
or
if
they
did
that
they
have
all
they
asked
for
and
nothing
of
what
they
hoped
poor
wretches
i
for
my
here
laurette
entered
followed
by
ted
she
threw
her
arms
round
stella
with
a
little
cry
don
t
laurette
this
is
what
i
am
determined
to
avoid
said
stella
holding
her
at
arms
length
but
laurette
was
half
intoxicated
with
joy
not
till
that
moment
had
she
really
believed
that
her
schemes
would
be
crowned
with
such
complete
success
she
pecked
once
or
twice
at
stella
s
cheeks
with
her
hard
little
lips
and
then
turned
to
courtland
her
face
wreathed
with
smiles
isn
t
it
too
delightful
after
all
these
years
of
waiting
she
said
to
him
pressing
his
hand
with
a
congratulatory
fervour
courtland
pale
and
erect
bowed
and
murmured
something
in
reply
then
he
turned
to
ritchie
and
took
his
hand
i
congratulate
you
ted
you
are
a
very
lucky
man
i
pray
there
was
a
sharp
break
in
his
voice
and
at
the
sound
a
cord
seemed
to
tighten
round
stella
s
heart
the
old
bond
between
them
had
been
a
very
strong
and
tender
one
now
that
the
irritation
of
finding
herself
as
she
thought
displaced
in
his
affection
was
lost
in
the
storm
that
had
swept
away
so
many
of
the
old
landmarks
her
heart
went
out
to
him
more
fully
only
she
had
to
guard
against
any
treacherous
yearning
for
full
sympathy
and
intimate
communion
she
must
be
inexorable
against
her
weakness
on
every
side
she
was
struggling
against
her
whole
nature
as
a
strong
athlete
struggles
for
victory
that
was
what
made
ritchie
s
society
safer
for
her
in
this
crisis
than
that
of
the
old
home
circle
he
was
imperturbably
he
had
a
strong
fund
of
animal
spirits
and
his
hand
could
never
touch
any
of
those
inner
cords
which
if
they
vibrated
at
all
brought
her
in
one
swift
moment
face
to
face
with
black
despair
and
gnawing
jealousy
she
conquered
the
climbing
sorrow
which
her
brother
s
emotion
awakened
then
going
up
to
him
and
putting
her
hands
in
his
she
said
softly
ah
you
dear
old
boy
you
have
always
been
so
good
to
me
ted
and
i
will
pull
all
straight
do
not
fear
as
for
you
never
forget
though
that
you
threw
me
over
she
raised
the
tips
of
her
brother
s
fingers
to
her
lips
as
she
spoke
and
he
was
instantly
melted
by
her
caressing
tenderness
she
was
always
confident
of
winning
entire
forgiveness
for
any
outbreak
of
caprice
or
wilfulness
the
moment
she
made
up
her
mind
to
be
quite
good
this
confidence
modified
by
an
air
of
imploring
entreaty
had
always
been
one
of
her
irresistible
moods
pull
all
straight
should
think
we
would
said
ted
proudly
possessing
himself
of
stella
s
left
hand
while
her
brother
held
the
right
how
long
do
you
mean
to
keep
up
that
wicked
little
story
about
my
throwing
you
over
said
cuthbert
smiling
fondly
at
her
as
he
stroked
her
hair
there
never
lived
the
human
being
who
could
make
me
do
that
and
stella
whatever
comes
or
goes
if
ever
you
are
in
trouble
or
perplexity
never
forget
that
if
need
were
i
would
lay
down
my
life
for
he
did
not
mean
to
say
so
much
but
there
was
some
undercurrent
of
feeling
at
work
which
he
could
hardly
analyze
he
only
knew
that
from
the
first
a
strong
misgiving
beset
him
as
to
this
marriage
at
courtland
s
words
a
vague
alarm
rose
in
laurette
s
breast
how
very
absurd
she
thought
to
herself
angrily
women
don
t
want
their
brothers
after
they
are
in
that
she
herself
had
only
wanted
her
brother
s
money
and
the
means
by
which
she
had
obtained
some
of
it
and
hoped
for
still
more
rose
before
her
for
the
first
time
in
an
almost
lurid
light
a
sudden
panic
fastened
on
her
lest
there
should
be
some
loophole
by
which
her
machinations
should
be
detected
but
she
had
gone
too
thoroughly
to
work
to
be
caught
in
the
toils
which
wreck
the
dissembler
it
is
not
cunning
but
simplicity
that
must
patch
and
tell
a
tale
which
often
carries
no
conviction
in
a
world
where
it
is
a
common
trade
to
make
the
thing
which
is
seem
as
though
it
were
not
simplicity
poor
unthrift
who
makes
no
use
of
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
and
the
glory
thereof
but
to
tell
the
truth
is
all
too
often
shamed
into
hiding
her
pensive
virginal
unaffected
brow
before
the
bold
rouged
menacing
front
of
her
successful
but
laurette
betrayed
none
of
the
uneasiness
which
shot
athwart
her
mind
indeed
her
anxieties
at
this
time
were
so
multiform
that
they
might
be
said
to
swallow
each
other
so
that
on
the
whole
she
kept
up
as
gay
an
appearance
as
though
no
cares
oppressed
her
chief
among
them
was
her
husband
s
intrigue
with
this
wretched
little
divorced
this
had
blossomed
apace
into
a
scheme
of
indefinite
migration
on
his
part
with
her
theatrical
company
laurette
knew
this
definitely
by
means
of
examining
the
honourable
talbot
s
when
he
slept
not
wisely
but
too
well
and
yet
she
felt
that
her
only
course
was
to
make
no
sign
to
feign
complete
ignorance
and
take
such
action
at
the
last
moment
that
is
the
eleventh
of
october
as
might
be
of
vital
service
to
her
then
that
letter
which
she
had
got
anson
to
write
it
was
only
after
fully
convincing
herself
that
langdale
s
mutilated
narrative
might
not
of
itself
serve
her
purpose
that
laurette
had
hit
on
the
scheme
of
boldly
supplementing
it
by
a
communication
which
would
at
once
throw
light
on
his
supposed
story
and
his
action
in
hastening
away
without
seeing
stella
she
judged
unerringly
too
that
the
thought
of
his
hastening
back
to
a
loving
wife
anxious
for
reconciliation
would
stab
the
girl
s
pride
into
more
active
resistance
against
grief
than
any
other
theory
stella
has
it
in
her
to
be
can
see
that
by
the
way
she
took
her
brother
s
engagement
reasoned
laurette
and
if
there
is
any
occasion
on
which
jealousy
may
grow
into
a
monster
surely
it
is
when
the
man
who
called
you
sweet
charity
and
the
innermost
leaf
of
his
heart
is
supposed
to
be
steaming
away
at
the
rate
of
seventeen
knots
an
hour
to
the
beautiful
woman
he
married
before
he
left
school
so
to
speak
not
that
i
believe
she
is
really
any
rate
if
so
her
conduct
is
very
unlike
that
of
other
people
who
could
do
nothing
to
oblige
one
in
life
so
much
as
to
leave
it
yes
all
her
calculations
had
been
singularly
favoured
by
providence
but
this
speedy
engagement
was
of
that
order
of
good
luck
which
all
but
frightens
one
it
was
almost
the
appearance
of
a
sociable
vulture
in
the
desert
when
drawing
near
a
well
that
may
prove
empty
all
that
evening
at
joran
s
private
theatricals
the
thought
rose
at
intervals
what
if
stella
and
langdale
met
abroad
and
yet
once
the
marriage
had
taken
place
what
would
it
avail
there
was
a
dance
after
the
acting
was
over
everyone
was
enraptured
with
talbot
s
masterly
performance
and
she
replied
to
congratulations
on
this
abominable
accomplishment
as
cheerfully
as
though
it
were
not
drawing
a
husband
and
a
father
as
she
styled
him
even
to
herself
in
her
more
melodramatic
moments
into
the
bohemian
depths
of
a
s
career
but
she
would
save
him
despite
was
usually
the
way
people
were
saved
when
once
they
gave
themselves
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
being
lost
and
to
secure
that
end
what
means
were
not
legitimate
yet
she
could
not
resist
the
inclination
to
reassure
herself
by
laughing
inquiry
of
a
distinguished
judge
as
to
whether
deception
practised
to
bring
marriage
about
could
in
any
way
invalidate
it
my
dear
tareling
what
could
have
put
such
an
uncanny
idea
into
your
head
what
marriage
would
be
safe
if
once
the
plea
of
deception
were
allowed
to
batter
against
the
foundations
of
the
holy
institution
of
matrimony
said
the
judge
laughing
take
the
deceptions
which
nature
puts
upon
us
to
begin
now
sir
henry
you
are
laughing
at
me
no
one
ever
knows
where
nature
begins
or
ends
i
do
not
mean
only
with
the
complexions
of
my
own
dear
the
judge
laughed
with
real
amusement
at
this
sally
laurette
fully
knew
the
value
of
talking
in
an
amusing
way
when
she
had
an
aim
to
serve
i
mean
real
deception
abstracting
letters
and
having
others
written
and
things
like
that
for
which
i
have
no
doubt
you
could
find
awful
names
in
some
of
your
awful
the
judge
fixed
his
gray
penetrating
eyes
on
the
softly
pretty
exquisitely
dressed
young
woman
before
him
vaguely
wondering
whose
interest
she
had
at
heart
in
this
inquiry
these
bright
pretty
young
women
have
often
a
wonderfully
altruistic
vein
in
their
natures
he
reflected
then
in
a
very
lucid
unpedantic
way
he
pointed
out
that
if
people
did
things
that
had
awful
names
in
they
might
be
brought
to
account
but
people
were
not
supposed
to
marry
because
other
people
abstracted
letters
or
wrote
sham
ones
marriage
was
a
contract
between
this
man
and
this
woman
for
certain
ends
clearly
set
forth
in
the
and
elsewhere
and
under
certain
conditions
if
these
conditions
were
observed
no
alleged
deception
on
the
part
of
anyone
else
could
in
the
slightest
affect
the
contract
well
after
all
how
beautifully
simple
and
reasonable
that
is
said
laurette
with
a
glow
of
enthusiasm
even
the
term
alleged
deception
carried
with
it
a
kind
of
balm
it
made
her
reflect
that
not
one
scratch
of
her
pen
had
been
contained
in
the
letters
that
had
suddenly
changed
the
whole
complexion
of
stella
s
life
she
had
erased
but
she
had
not
formed
a
single
letter
and
the
little
note
anson
had
written
at
her
dictation
was
like
eternity
without
beginning
or
end
without
date
or
local
habitation
after
all
what
a
bulwark
to
society
the
law
was
her
spirits
rose
and
she
felt
like
an
eastern
hero
as
if
she
were
destined
to
destroy
afrits
a
little
afterwards
when
in
conversation
with
the
honourable
miss
brendover
this
lady
said
something
of
having
spent
the
last
winter
in
berlin
where
the
musical
season
had
been
very
brilliant
it
flashed
through
laurette
s
mind
like
an
inspiration
that
berlin
was
the
very
city
to
which
it
would
be
safest
for
ted
and
stella
to
go
in
the
first
instance
england
would
not
be
safe
for
awhile
langdale
would
most
likely
go
on
to
brussels
before
going
there
then
he
would
get
the
newspaper
announcing
the
marriage
which
she
would
send
him
the
very
day
after
the
event
came
off
laurette
had
taken
down
the
address
he
had
inclosed
for
stella
which
was
that
of
his
lawyer
in
london
well
after
getting
that
newspaper
he
would
at
once
perceive
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
bear
his
fate
he
would
not
be
likely
to
return
to
australia
he
would
perhaps
drift
about
travelling
for
awhile
now
france
and
italy
were
the
happy
of
all
travellers
but
my
dear
milly
i
wish
you
would
tell
my
about
the
music
in
berlin
said
laurette
i
fancy
she
thought
of
going
to
oh
and
then
they
will
meet
talbot
s
cousins
avenells
so
it
will
be
quite
nice
and
friendly
for
ritchie
in
a
foreign
land
he
does
not
know
german
i
think
before
the
evening
was
over
stella
had
a
long
chat
with
miss
brendover
chiefly
about
the
charms
of
winter
in
berlin
at
the
same
time
laurette
duly
impressed
ted
with
the
wisdom
of
going
there
direct
if
stella
expressed
any
wish
of
the
kind
i
don
t
care
a
copper
where
stella
wants
to
go
returned
ted
whatever
she
wants
to
do
she
the
subject
somehow
came
up
again
as
they
drove
home
i
lost
a
waltz
with
you
stella
said
ted
ruefully
what
a
lot
you
and
that
old
cousin
of
talbot
s
had
to
say
to
each
other
old
is
charmingly
young
returned
stella
i
know
because
that
waltz
of
strauss
the
way
never
ask
me
to
dance
to
one
i
heard
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
oh
it
was
a
strange
enchanted
sort
of
of
fairy
stories
and
i
believed
them
her
cheeks
were
deeply
flushed
and
her
eyes
were
shining
with
a
feverish
light
ted
was
always
pleased
when
stella
was
inspired
with
something
of
her
old
gaiety
and
yet
there
was
something
in
the
sound
of
her
voice
that
disturbed
him
did
you
tell
miss
brendover
about
this
country
then
and
was
that
what
kept
you
chatting
so
long
oh
of
it
came
trilling
back
in
the
music
but
between
i
listened
to
glowing
accounts
of
wonderful
berlin
trained
musicians
playing
an
accompaniment
like
one
man
shall
we
go
to
berlin
stella
and
take
egypt
and
the
other
places
on
the
way
back
happy
thought
cried
stella
lightly
charter
a
vessel
direct
before
ten
no
but
i
am
serious
stella
the
sails
on
the
sixteenth
can
not
we
get
away
before
then
said
stella
ted
s
heart
thumped
wildly
at
the
question
there
is
a
french
he
began
slowly
but
she
held
up
her
hands
a
french
for
your
life
there
is
some
very
good
reason
the
book
of
there
is
an
orient
steamer
on
the
ninth
of
october
will
your
mother
consent
to
such
haste
ah
that
is
your
concern
ted
you
must
explain
everything
when
you
write
mind
i
take
no
responsibility
beyond
the
usual
fibs
of
the
marriage
laurette
was
leaning
back
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage
with
closed
eyes
as
if
she
heard
nothing
no
one
could
be
more
discreet
and
wary
and
less
observant
where
observation
would
have
been
an
element
of
danger
she
roused
up
when
they
got
home
and
she
sat
rattling
away
to
stella
and
ted
about
all
sorts
of
indifferent
things
did
you
see
new
poet
young
man
with
the
sombre
expression
and
the
long
hair
is
that
one
of
the
signs
of
a
to
go
to
the
barber
asked
ted
oh
besides
that
you
must
write
what
is
life
but
a
spectre
of
bale
what
is
joy
but
a
curse
that
is
stale
that
is
one
of
the
couplets
quotes
in
dusky
corners
with
a
tremolo
in
her
voice
i
wonder
why
that
little
makes
a
point
of
fastening
on
me
on
every
available
occasion
of
late
don
t
you
approve
of
her
laurette
asked
stella
with
a
lurking
smile
well
no
i
think
the
way
she
flirts
in
public
using
the
last
pattern
of
young
man
she
approves
of
like
a
fan
to
keep
her
husband
out
of
sight
is
a
little
too
and
then
she
seems
to
have
them
to
suit
her
style
of
dress
when
she
is
in
pale
heliotrope
velvet
it
is
that
large
young
idiot
with
a
lisp
and
flaxen
hair
but
he
seems
to
be
playing
truant
lately
it
must
really
be
a
trying
moment
when
the
young
man
who
seemed
to
have
been
sent
by
heaven
into
the
world
to
hold
your
bouquet
sympathetically
begins
to
get
out
of
your
what
the
deuce
does
her
husband
allow
it
for
is
he
like
said
ted
who
was
picking
up
leaves
that
had
fallen
from
stella
s
nosegay
of
blush
roses
and
wondering
why
larry
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
go
to
the
nursery
or
somewhere
he
had
not
been
a
moment
alone
with
stella
since
their
engagement
oh
don
t
you
know
him
by
sight
he
is
rather
a
man
with
six
or
seven
hairs
on
his
chin
he
looks
as
if
he
could
ride
in
the
air
if
he
had
the
proper
sort
of
broomstick
he
never
opens
his
lips
unless
you
make
a
mistake
about
figures
no
he
isn
t
amusing
but
nothing
of
that
kind
excuses
a
woman
in
such
conduct
you
may
congratulate
yourself
my
dear
stella
rose
with
a
bored
expression
she
said
kissing
the
tips
of
her
gloved
hand
to
both
and
gliding
out
of
the
room
before
ted
could
reach
the
proceeding
which
need
hardly
be
characterized
as
unsatisfactory
to
ritchie
by
jove
i
shall
never
be
sure
of
stella
till
we
re
safely
and
substantially
married
he
said
looking
after
her
with
knitted
brows
true
therefore
let
it
be
on
the
sixth
of
october
and
sail
on
the
sixteenth
said
laurette
decisively
you
will
reach
berlin
before
the
end
of
november
to
be
done
in
that
time
a
courtship
of
five
it
s
more
like
ten
broke
in
ted
and
we
were
engaged
once
yes
allude
to
that
no
one
can
be
surprised
at
your
determination
to
make
sure
of
the
young
lady
allude
to
it
i
don
t
know
how
to
allude
to
things
i
shall
simply
put
it
down
in
black
and
white
by
the
way
larry
where
is
tareling
laurette
murmured
something
in
reply
which
was
not
audible
but
as
she
offered
no
explanation
this
did
not
much
signify
he
did
his
part
very
well
said
ted
taking
out
his
preparatory
to
retiring
but
do
you
suppose
anyone
would
ever
carry
on
in
that
way
in
real
people
and
stealing
letters
oh
people
must
put
something
into
plays
said
laurette
contemptuously
as
a
matter
of
fact
her
own
little
performance
in
that
line
had
been
infinitely
superior
and
she
may
have
felt
something
of
the
scorn
of
a
finished
artist
for
a
pretentious
amateur
what
did
not
occur
to
her
was
the
irony
which
underlay
her
discussion
of
such
a
theme
she
was
preoccupied
with
thoughts
of
checkmating
talbot
s
secret
plans
and
withal
profoundly
grateful
that
she
was
freed
from
the
haunting
fear
of
being
forced
to
retire
to
the
wilds
of
the
australian
bush
instead
of
shining
in
her
proper
orbit
she
remembered
the
learned
judge
s
words
with
a
fresh
glow
of
gratitude
and
recalled
with
solemn
approval
a
maxim
she
had
somewhere
heard
or
read
that
we
can
benefit
others
in
no
surer
way
than
by
making
the
best
of
our
own
lives
how
true
this
was
as
applied
to
herself
the
best
use
she
could
make
of
her
life
was
certainly
to
maintain
her
position
in
melbourne
society
until
she
might
perhaps
be
called
on
to
take
her
place
among
the
titled
aristocracy
of
england
and
in
her
efforts
to
keep
this
position
she
was
securing
ted
s
happiness
protecting
stella
from
the
danger
of
entanglement
with
a
married
man
and
most
important
of
all
in
a
way
to
thwart
the
wild
folly
of
her
husband
and
the
father
of
her
children
being
in
a
very
wakeful
mood
she
wrote
several
letters
to
members
of
the
courtland
family
she
begged
pardon
in
a
pretty
winning
way
for
siding
wholly
with
stella
and
ted
in
the
arrangement
of
being
married
in
time
to
leave
by
the
sixteenth
of
october
this
was
partly
because
of
business
arrangements
which
compelled
ted
to
leave
by
that
date
partly
because
after
all
that
had
passed
prompt
action
was
best
she
was
taking
the
liberty
of
seeing
to
stella
s
trousseau
so
as
to
save
time
not
that
it
would
be
a
very
extensive
affair
why
should
it
she
had
so
many
pretty
dresses
and
she
was
going
to
the
great
centres
of
fashion
etc
xlii
breakfast
was
late
next
morning
at
monico
lodge
and
the
master
of
the
house
did
not
make
his
appearance
there
were
times
when
he
simply
haunted
the
quite
the
closest
approximation
to
a
ghost
the
neighbourhood
could
produce
it
might
however
be
urged
by
the
charitably
inclined
that
his
notions
of
day
and
night
had
been
seriously
upset
by
having
spent
most
of
his
life
at
the
years
of
age
when
he
left
england
six
years
previously
i
wrote
my
letter
to
your
mother
this
morning
want
you
just
to
look
over
it
said
ted
as
they
rose
from
the
table
laurette
was
deep
in
arrangements
for
her
ball
and
left
the
young
people
to
themselves
in
a
little
morning
apartment
off
the
and
mind
stella
directly
after
lunch
we
must
go
to
see
about
your
dresses
she
announcement
which
stella
received
with
incredulous
amazement
stella
have
you
got
a
conscience
asked
ted
as
she
ensconced
herself
in
an
armchair
behind
a
davenport
by
the
window
yes
occasionally
but
it
s
good
to
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
said
stella
and
then
seeing
ted
s
aggrieved
face
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
you
may
kiss
the
little
finger
ted
who
was
a
traitor
on
your
side
when
there
wasn
t
a
cloud
in
the
but
sooner
or
later
you
know
ah
later
then
now
what
have
you
written
my
dear
courtland
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
stella
and
i
are
fast
engaged
once
more
and
with
your
kind
consent
we
must
be
married
on
the
fifth
of
next
month
so
as
to
set
sail
for
europe
on
the
sixteenth
you
see
stella
i
can
not
make
it
any
sooner
said
ted
with
a
twinkle
in
his
line
being
to
keep
stella
literally
to
her
mood
of
last
that
is
as
you
object
to
the
french
line
there
is
an
extra
boat
to
sail
on
the
she
sat
staring
at
him
as
if
she
did
not
hear
him
she
was
following
in
the
wake
of
a
ship
that
went
on
its
remorseless
way
day
and
night
speeding
every
hour
nearer
to
its
goal
did
it
bear
hearts
that
beat
joyfully
at
the
thought
i
do
not
believe
you
hear
what
i
say
stella
oh
yes
i
do
what
makes
you
think
my
mother
will
be
glad
for
me
to
leave
her
i
don
t
a
fellow
must
say
something
but
about
the
french
boat
do
not
speak
of
that
line
there
was
only
one
little
christian
boat
among
them
all
and
it
went
down
in
a
frightful
storm
in
long
way
off
but
still
at
times
i
hear
the
cries
of
the
drowning
and
there
is
a
woman
s
face
she
does
not
sink
but
she
has
lost
everything
stella
if
you
want
to
spin
a
yarn
as
you
used
to
do
tell
a
jollier
one
than
that
thing
anyone
would
think
you
saw
it
and
your
eyes
are
getting
larger
than
she
got
up
and
looked
at
herself
in
a
little
mirror
near
her
he
followed
her
and
put
his
arms
round
her
for
god
s
sake
don
t
she
cried
starting
back
as
if
she
were
stabbed
and
then
the
next
moment
she
turned
on
herself
with
fierce
disdain
she
whose
whole
frame
had
thrilled
with
rapture
at
the
touch
of
lips
whose
kisses
were
forsworn
what
right
had
she
to
repulse
the
honest
love
of
a
man
who
had
been
faithful
to
her
from
boyhood
to
whom
she
had
promised
all
her
future
life
forgive
me
ted
she
said
humbly
but
i
am
nervous
lately
and
you
took
me
by
she
stroked
his
hand
and
he
flushed
hotly
under
the
touch
all
right
stella
now
let
s
go
on
with
this
letter
this
hurry
is
partly
because
of
business
arrangements
and
also
because
being
engaged
before
and
nothing
came
of
it
it
s
better
to
avoid
accidents
as
for
me
i
have
waited
so
long
and
felt
often
so
frightfully
down
on
my
luck
i
would
much
sooner
the
wedding
were
than
any
other
day
you
have
always
been
so
kind
to
me
i
m
sure
you
won
t
say
a
word
against
this
plan
for
i
know
stella
couldn
t
bear
to
do
anything
against
your
wishes
it
would
be
only
foolish
sort
of
jawing
for
me
to
say
how
much
i
love
stella
long
before
i
should
be
thinking
of
such
things
i
made
up
my
mind
she
should
be
my
wife
many
a
day
since
i
thought
this
would
never
be
but
it
has
come
all
right
now
so
hoping
you
will
concur
in
the
above
i
am
dear
courtland
yours
most
respectfully
edward
ritchie
stella
can
have
everything
she
wants
in
paris
or
elsewhere
it
would
be
foolish
for
her
to
lay
in
a
big
stock
of
clothes
the
dress
she
has
on
now
would
be
the
nicest
of
all
for
her
to
be
married
in
she
will
have
a
thousand
a
year
for
frills
and
things
and
as
much
more
as
she
likes
so
it
would
be
foolery
for
her
to
have
an
army
of
trunks
full
of
things
she
can
get
where
we
are
going
will
that
do
stella
oh
very
well
ted
but
are
you
sure
that
we
are
both
awake
on
the
fifth
of
next
month
yes
fourteen
long
days
it
s
rather
a
shame
but
i
suppose
we
can
t
fix
it
earlier
you
won
t
go
back
on
the
date
stella
after
all
you
know
your
mother
has
had
you
far
longer
than
she
should
if
you
hadn
t
gone
back
on
the
first
racket
now
you
write
and
back
me
up
you
see
cuth
and
dora
will
be
going
back
with
you
and
tom
engaged
and
allie
soon
to
be
married
they
won
t
miss
you
stella
it
s
not
as
though
your
mother
were
a
duck
with
one
oh
ted
what
names
and
then
stella
smiled
go
on
stella
write
your
letter
i
want
to
post
it
and
then
take
you
for
a
ride
look
at
that
young
calf
of
a
dustiefoot
with
his
snout
against
the
window
looking
at
you
it
floors
me
how
he
finds
out
so
soon
the
room
you
are
i
need
not
write
a
separate
letter
there
is
room
on
this
of
stella
took
up
a
pen
and
wrote
hastily
dearest
mother
and
all
of
you
do
not
be
too
much
taken
by
surprise
we
had
better
keep
to
the
time
named
by
ted
as
we
must
get
away
on
the
sixteenth
we
shall
escape
all
the
apostle
spoons
and
things
every
household
should
be
without
i
shall
be
married
in
a
and
i
really
don
t
see
what
i
want
with
any
more
things
i
have
been
so
extravagant
this
last
year
and
tom
has
given
me
so
many
loans
i
suppose
he
will
throw
an
old
shoe
for
good
luck
but
will
it
be
necessary
when
one
has
a
thousand
a
year
for
frills
i
kiss
you
all
three
times
on
the
mouth
your
loving
don
t
you
ever
stop
to
think
what
you
are
going
to
say
stella
not
when
i
write
to
say
that
we
are
to
be
married
in
fourteen
ted
read
the
lines
stella
had
written
and
his
face
gleamed
with
joy
oh
that
is
splendid
he
cried
but
should
you
put
that
in
about
the
thousand
a
year
shouldn
t
it
will
it
be
necessary
when
we
love
each
other
so
much
it
is
indifferent
one
of
the
advantages
of
so
much
social
superstition
is
that
a
good
many
things
are
taken
for
ted
notwithstanding
made
the
correction
in
his
uncial
squarely
legible
writing
then
he
dwelt
on
the
last
sentence
and
looked
reproachfully
into
the
girl
s
face
you
kiss
everyone
at
fairacre
three
times
on
the
mouth
but
you
don
t
kiss
me
in
two
weeks
you
leave
every
man
jack
of
them
for
my
sake
stella
do
you
call
it
decent
or
according
to
god
s
holy
ordinance
as
it
says
in
the
he
bent
over
her
and
she
turned
her
cheek
to
him
but
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
covered
her
face
with
burning
kisses
she
turned
deadly
pale
and
trembled
but
remained
as
passive
as
if
she
had
been
drugged
then
after
a
little
she
fought
down
the
crowding
thoughts
that
made
the
present
give
place
to
what
had
been
memory
like
a
rebel
betrayed
her
to
a
surging
host
of
recollections
that
seemed
to
stamp
this
moment
with
a
seal
of
infamy
but
the
keen
pangs
of
wounded
pride
of
hopeless
love
and
jealousy
came
to
her
aid
she
conquered
her
shrinking
shame
her
instinctive
herself
that
it
was
less
humiliating
to
be
kissed
by
unloved
lips
than
by
those
that
were
so
dear
to
her
tell
me
stella
you
are
not
sorry
you
gave
me
back
your
promise
again
yesterday
said
ted
in
a
low
voice
sorry
oh
am
glad
she
replied
feeling
for
the
time
her
words
were
fiercely
did
she
seek
to
trample
out
that
smouldering
jealousy
which
was
ever
ready
to
leap
into
consuming
flame
he
was
more
than
content
with
the
answer
yet
after
she
disengaged
herself
from
his
arms
he
tested
her
tardy
passionately
submission
a
little
farther
stella
come
and
kiss
me
on
the
mouth
three
times
he
said
in
a
tremulous
voice
almost
to
her
own
astonishment
she
obeyed
yes
it
was
part
of
the
bargain
it
made
this
incredible
transaction
all
the
more
irrevocable
it
made
those
days
she
would
give
her
right
hand
to
sink
in
utter
oblivion
more
impossible
from
that
day
she
did
not
even
in
thought
go
back
from
her
approaching
marriage
it
was
as
though
she
had
drunk
of
some
opiate
that
deadened
her
moral
nature
she
seemed
to
escape
all
fears
all
responsibility
and
the
envenomed
darts
of
memory
she
was
so
much
occupied
during
the
day
she
danced
so
much
at
night
she
was
so
bent
on
being
amused
all
the
time
that
none
but
the
closest
observer
would
have
doubted
the
real
source
of
this
abandonment
to
gaiety
once
or
twice
ted
in
a
clumsy
but
honest
way
tried
to
speak
seriously
of
his
own
felt
unworthiness
being
misled
by
the
statement
laurette
had
once
made
as
to
stella
s
suspicion
of
his
failure
in
conduct
but
stella
treated
these
attempts
like
jugglers
to
spin
in
the
air
but
not
to
let
them
down
with
a
crash
have
you
any
wives
hidden
away
ted
she
asked
arching
her
brows
at
him
oh
come
stella
you
know
very
well
you
shouldn
t
talk
in
that
it
was
a
fact
that
at
this
time
her
irresponsible
levity
sometimes
wounded
ted
s
moral
because
she
was
so
unlike
her
former
self
shouldn
t
i
let
me
assure
you
people
s
wives
do
turn
up
when
they
ought
to
be
dead
but
you
haven
t
got
one
at
all
it
seems
no
doubt
there
was
a
time
when
you
should
have
married
some
but
you
didn
it
is
all
right
isn
t
it
beautifully
simple
it
was
unpardonable
and
ted
who
felt
in
a
dumb
way
that
she
was
his
higher
conscience
began
to
think
that
after
all
he
had
no
need
to
be
so
remorseful
when
he
thought
over
the
curious
difference
presented
by
the
spotless
record
of
stella
s
life
and
his
own
he
supposed
women
of
sense
always
understood
that
things
were
so
though
of
course
a
line
must
be
drawn
somewhere
stella
was
in
truth
passing
through
that
phase
of
deterioration
in
which
some
men
gamble
and
drink
deep
so
as
to
escape
from
themselves
she
succeeded
by
ignoring
all
her
better
aspirations
all
the
higher
capacities
of
her
mind
in
drowning
thought
and
numbing
her
sense
of
what
was
right
to
a
strange
degree
she
had
a
strong
will
and
the
unusual
mental
discipline
through
which
she
had
passed
early
in
life
had
given
her
a
rare
power
of
controlling
her
thoughts
she
exercised
both
faculties
to
the
utmost
degree
in
casting
from
her
memory
the
immediate
past
but
this
was
so
woven
into
the
deepest
fibres
of
her
being
that
to
accomplish
this
object
was
to
become
to
a
certain
degree
morally
callous
it
was
one
of
those
remedies
infinitely
more
injurious
to
the
soul
than
the
original
disease
laurette
was
amazed
at
the
change
which
had
come
over
stella
she
was
at
the
same
time
a
little
afraid
of
the
element
of
inconsequence
bound
up
with
this
alteration
it
was
all
very
well
as
long
as
nothing
in
particular
happened
but
everyone
knows
that
life
is
full
of
accidents
it
is
not
easy
for
women
to
deceive
one
another
this
is
one
reason
why
their
strictures
on
each
other
often
strike
men
as
being
malicious
laurette
had
a
very
definite
idea
that
her
future
was
because
she
had
grown
indifferent
to
langdale
but
because
she
cared
too
much
the
last
night
of
stella
s
stay
in
melbourne
they
had
been
at
a
government
house
ball
and
on
their
return
they
sat
chatting
for
some
little
time
i
suppose
you
will
really
live
very
little
at
strathhaye
stella
when
you
return
said
laurette
who
was
an
adept
at
leading
up
to
what
she
wanted
to
say
by
beginning
a
long
way
off
i
have
hardly
considered
the
matter
replied
stella
playing
with
the
brilliant
diamond
hoop
which
was
her
you
take
so
kindly
to
melbourne
life
now
and
i
must
say
you
are
likely
to
be
rather
spoiled
you
will
be
very
popular
what
story
of
yours
sent
the
old
marchioness
lismore
into
such
roars
of
laughter
oh
a
rather
hideous
anecdote
about
an
old
aboriginal
who
wanted
to
be
baptized
while
he
carried
the
remains
of
an
enemy
in
his
hair
till
he
should
kill
the
as
well
the
old
dame
was
talking
quite
seriously
about
the
possibility
of
christianizing
our
natives
and
i
felt
bound
to
support
her
well
she
laughed
like
a
what
a
wig
she
wears
to
be
sure
the
more
one
reads
the
society
papers
and
sees
of
the
english
aristocracy
the
less
one
is
impressed
by
them
considering
all
it
takes
to
keep
them
going
they
should
be
a
little
more
different
from
the
common
herd
i
suppose
the
marchioness
invited
you
to
visit
them
when
you
go
to
england
yes
but
i
remembered
the
fate
of
your
friends
the
jorans
and
i
did
not
commit
myself
besides
i
don
t
want
to
go
to
england
much
but
of
course
you
will
go
with
ted
to
see
uncle
then
there
are
your
own
friends
and
i
don
t
know
claude
s
wife
declares
that
family
circles
there
get
upon
one
s
nerves
dreadfully
that
at
any
rate
is
one
striking
advantage
of
an
aristocracy
they
are
not
formal
and
squeezy
and
peering
timorously
at
other
people
to
see
how
they
how
long
do
you
think
you
ll
be
away
laurette
don
t
turn
into
a
catechism
without
the
answers
as
long
as
it
is
quite
you
have
decided
upon
berlin
for
the
winter
oh
yes
we
go
direct
there
from
well
stella
you
are
certainly
a
very
fortunate
as
fortunate
as
call
no
man
fortunate
till
he
is
dead
and
no
woman
till
she
is
oh
of
course
i
don
t
at
all
mean
to
say
that
like
everyone
else
you
won
t
have
your
own
trials
men
are
pretty
much
alike
in
many
ways
a
girl
may
marry
the
greatest
milksop
alive
but
after
all
she
is
bound
to
find
herself
hopelessly
behind
the
don
t
you
think
larry
you
might
be
a
little
more
entertaining
you
remind
one
a
little
of
a
vivisector
who
for
certain
experiments
makes
a
lesion
in
the
neck
of
a
and
then
pinches
its
nose
to
throw
it
into
convulsions
i
don
t
mind
so
much
about
my
neck
but
i
am
rather
sensitive
about
my
well
stella
dear
you
must
forgive
something
to
the
weakness
of
a
loving
sister
i
can
t
help
seeing
that
lately
you
are
more
brilliant
and
somehow
harder
in
the
midst
of
my
joy
on
ted
s
account
i
sometimes
ask
myself
does
stella
really
love
him
enough
will
she
be
able
to
overlook
his
faults
and
help
him
and
lead
him
oh
laurette
what
have
you
been
reading
cried
stella
and
she
laughed
outright
looking
on
with
an
animated
face
as
though
she
were
witnessing
a
comedy
but
not
a
muscle
of
laurette
s
face
moved
either
in
mirth
or
anger
ah
my
dear
when
you
have
my
maturity
of
experience
as
a
wife
and
mother
you
will
better
understand
my
anxieties
if
i
thought
that
you
did
not
really
love
ted
i
would
say
to
you
even
now
pause
before
it
is
too
late
it
was
inexpressibly
comic
only
the
play
of
daily
life
is
often
marred
by
the
fact
that
we
generally
the
whole
gem
but
merely
one
or
two
facets
yet
on
the
other
hand
to
see
comedy
in
its
more
intimate
bearings
as
it
affects
ourselves
might
frequently
mean
that
all
sense
of
fun
would
be
merged
in
that
of
tragic
irony
stella
sat
with
such
undisguised
amusement
on
her
face
waiting
for
this
to
go
on
that
laurette
instantly
took
up
a
fresh
cue
but
of
course
it
is
only
my
fears
and
what
makes
it
so
very
safe
for
you
is
having
been
friends
ever
since
you
were
babies
i
may
say
but
it
s
just
one
of
the
things
we
women
have
to
take
the
world
as
we
find
it
to
do
that
in
married
life
one
must
start
with
a
good
stock
of
affection
where
should
i
have
been
without
it
we
soon
discover
that
our
fairy
tales
and
imaginations
have
been
raised
far
enough
away
from
reality
many
people
were
of
opinion
that
if
your
sister
esther
for
instance
had
not
been
so
horrified
and
scornful
when
she
found
raymond
went
a
little
into
queer
dear
why
do
you
stare
so
i
mean
among
the
à
quinze
now
that
you
are
to
be
married
one
may
mention
speckled
fruit
before
between
them
might
have
turned
out
differently
i
dare
say
she
forgave
him
at
intervals
but
if
a
man
must
forgive
his
brother
seventy
times
seven
how
often
must
a
woman
forgive
her
husband
it
s
not
put
in
the
bible
partly
i
think
because
there
is
not
enough
arithmetic
going
to
make
it
up
and
it
s
not
only
forgiving
but
making
light
of
it
in
a
way
to
do
that
one
must
really
enjoy
one
s
that
s
what
you
have
the
power
of
doing
you
have
to
come
down
a
cropper
or
two
in
your
ideals
but
you
will
soon
find
that
a
young
married
woman
in
a
good
position
with
plenty
of
money
and
some
brains
has
more
advantages
is
more
perfectly
independent
than
any
other
creature
in
the
world
you
will
get
on
with
all
sorts
of
people
you
can
have
a
if
you
try
and
succeed
better
than
poor
if
no
one
else
says
smart
things
you
will
yourself
and
then
of
course
you
will
be
sure
to
have
enemies
and
they
are
often
far
more
useful
in
amusing
one
than
any
friends
what
could
be
more
diverting
than
to
watch
people
come
to
you
their
faces
covered
with
smiles
their
hearts
on
their
lips
so
to
speak
as
they
stretch
out
their
hands
to
you
and
yet
you
know
all
the
time
they
never
say
a
true
word
of
you
behind
your
back
unless
you
are
ugly
or
stupid
i
expect
you
will
bring
back
heaps
of
lovely
things
and
of
course
you
will
go
to
worth
as
you
are
coming
home
of
course
too
you
will
go
to
visit
the
lillimore
family
talbot
said
the
other
day
his
mother
would
be
perfectly
charmed
to
know
you
there
are
three
unmarried
none
of
them
under
and
none
of
them
very
but
how
can
you
wonder
they
are
very
poor
and
their
letters
are
always
like
jeremiah
s
lands
and
mortgages
if
ever
talbot
succeeds
to
the
title
i
shall
be
at
my
wits
ends
for
what
would
be
the
use
of
being
swallowed
up
in
london
society
and
passing
your
time
scheming
how
to
make
ends
meet
they
do
not
even
give
me
any
of
those
little
details
one
longs
for
so
they
write
sometimes
about
the
sausage
people
and
the
and
the
jew
meaning
those
who
have
made
their
money
by
these
articles
but
after
all
what
is
the
good
of
trying
to
throw
names
at
people
about
the
way
their
money
has
been
made
land
is
going
down
and
down
in
england
they
can
t
grow
wool
much
nor
wine
nor
cotton
and
the
farmers
are
going
to
places
where
they
can
make
more
money
and
become
gentry
on
their
own
account
and
there
s
no
class
in
all
the
world
that
need
money
so
constantly
in
large
sums
as
an
aristocracy
they
want
to
be
always
well
amused
and
well
fed
and
well
dearest
things
in
all
the
on
top
of
it
all
to
do
no
work
which
is
dearer
than
all
the
rest
put
be
in
fact
almond
tumblers
whose
beaks
are
so
soft
they
must
be
fed
out
of
a
spoon
which
is
no
doubt
very
genteel
as
long
as
you
can
get
people
to
feed
you
but
the
middle
ages
are
long
over
why
even
here
in
a
properly
democratic
country
how
soon
everyone
conspires
to
make
you
feel
your
poverty
i
have
often
thought
if
one
continued
hopelessly
poor
all
one
s
life
one
would
have
to
take
to
the
love
of
would
be
nothing
else
surely
you
are
not
threatened
with
such
destitution
larry
said
stella
smiling
why
ted
has
more
money
than
he
knows
what
to
do
with
he
must
give
you
my
dear
that
is
very
sweet
and
good
of
you
but
you
know
how
absurdly
awkward
one
feels
about
taking
money
and
of
course
our
poverty
after
all
is
comparative
it
consists
largely
in
having
to
fall
back
on
but
what
that
is
a
bitter
cross
in
itself
they
are
more
flattered
by
your
patronage
but
they
charge
nearly
as
much
indeed
they
leave
out
nothing
but
the
surah
muslin
and
company
who
descend
to
the
paltriest
details
if
you
have
a
dress
made
at
their
putting
the
down
as
an
then
put
in
sundries
one
pound
fifteen
shillings
and
there
is
hardly
anything
in
life
more
tiresome
than
a
dressmaker
who
is
not
quite
her
fingers
are
always
cold
and
she
touch
your
skin
and
stick
pins
in
you
and
hold
things
in
her
mouth
and
say
in
a
gushing
way
yes
madam
it
will
be
a
most
fit
and
then
take
a
cheerful
snip
out
of
your
arms
with
her
scissors
stella
you
will
never
know
anything
of
these
small
miseries
well
i
wish
it
were
possible
for
me
to
come
to
your
wedding
but
talbot
can
not
leave
town
as
i
said
and
i
must
not
go
without
him
but
you
are
to
stay
with
us
the
few
days
you
are
in
melbourne
before
leaving
what
a
charming
idea
that
is
of
ted
s
to
drive
you
in
his
new
drag
from
adelaide
to
strathhaye
laurette
found
everything
in
stella
s
lot
all
the
more
charming
just
then
by
reason
of
ted
s
action
in
presenting
her
only
that
morning
with
a
cheque
for
two
thousand
pounds
xliii
it
was
the
evening
before
stella
s
she
had
returned
in
company
with
her
brother
cuthbert
and
his
and
their
presence
and
the
interest
of
their
new
relationship
shielded
her
from
undivided
attention
a
few
days
afterwards
came
wallerton
with
her
children
everyone
knows
how
a
family
reunion
serves
to
minimize
the
concentration
of
attention
on
any
one
individual
of
the
circle
it
is
a
small
republic
in
which
after
the
manner
of
limited
monarchies
those
who
reign
do
not
rule
claude
hector
aged
eight
months
being
the
youngest
member
and
till
then
a
complete
stranger
to
his
older
relatives
was
a
great
centre
of
attraction
then
dora
with
her
pretty
affectionate
little
ways
drew
great
attention
if
anyone
sang
or
played
dora
always
begged
for
one
more
song
or
a
little
more
music
if
one
spoke
a
little
hoarsely
she
never
forgot
to
inquire
next
morning
with
the
deepest
concern
after
the
afflicted
throat
she
was
always
gliding
about
to
put
a
footstool
under
someone
s
feet
or
to
recover
a
straying
newspaper
or
a
dropped
needle
then
when
anyone
spoke
she
always
listened
with
the
most
reverential
attention
when
cuthbert
spoke
she
would
often
murmur
one
of
his
sentences
over
to
herself
as
if
better
to
impress
it
on
her
memory
she
was
in
fact
what
is
known
in
england
as
a
very
sweet
girl
in
australia
unfortunately
the
species
is
so
rare
that
no
specific
name
has
had
to
be
invented
dora
was
to
stay
at
fairacre
for
a
month
after
the
wedding
and
felix
harrison
could
not
refrain
from
saying
to
allie
that
the
change
from
stella
to
dora
was
rather
soothing
but
indeed
her
approaching
marriage
seems
already
to
have
improved
her
the
young
man
said
meditatively
he
had
many
good
qualities
and
withal
a
liberal
estimate
of
his
own
abilities
this
had
long
been
a
subject
of
treatment
with
stella
i
hope
stella
won
t
alter
much
returned
alice
who
was
embroidering
a
for
her
own
future
home
i
began
to
think
she
never
would
accept
i
think
she
is
a
very
lucky
girl
if
you
ask
me
ritchie
simply
worships
the
ground
she
treads
on
and
she
must
be
fond
of
him
though
she
so
long
kept
up
that
indifferent
way
why
these
last
few
days
at
home
she
spends
most
of
the
time
with
him
on
now
the
last
few
days
had
passed
and
was
the
stella
sat
in
the
little
library
on
a
footstool
at
her
mother
s
feet
both
windows
were
open
through
one
banksia
roses
were
drooping
in
heavy
clusters
through
the
other
a
microphylla
rosebush
peeped
with
its
thick
foliage
of
small
green
leaves
buds
unclosing
and
roses
fully
blown
with
hearts
and
outer
petals
deadly
pale
the
sun
was
setting
in
golden
splendour
and
all
the
atmosphere
was
warm
and
rosy
the
lovely
adelaide
hills
had
caught
the
glow
all
along
their
crests
with
magical
effect
the
pigeons
were
flying
to
their
cotes
in
scores
and
the
soft
beating
of
their
wings
in
the
garden
clove
the
air
like
silken
banners
there
is
one
thing
that
troubles
me
a
little
darling
the
mother
said
in
her
tender
voice
with
its
soft
celtic
intonations
i
thought
on
your
you
would
communicate
it
would
be
possible
to
do
that
with
our
old
friend
the
archdeacon
though
you
have
not
been
confirmed
i
should
like
you
to
enter
on
your
new
life
by
drawing
near
the
visible
mother
i
can
not
answered
the
girl
with
averted
face
as
she
held
her
mother
s
hand
in
both
hers
well
my
child
you
are
in
god
s
hands
i
do
not
fear
but
you
will
yet
find
him
who
is
the
soul
s
most
precious
possession
in
our
span
of
life
the
rose
is
ever
neighbour
with
the
web
woven
with
threads
not
all
of
our
choosing
and
yet
god
grants
us
to
reap
our
hundredfold
even
in
this
life
in
marriage
itself
when
two
hearts
and
souls
cleave
together
what
deep
and
sacred
happiness
has
he
not
granted
to
us
a
burning
flame
of
colour
rose
and
spread
over
the
girl
s
face
how
unjustifiable
did
her
marriage
appear
to
her
in
the
white
light
of
her
mother
s
consecrated
throughout
with
fidelity
to
the
higher
ideals
that
sway
human
conduct
but
she
sternly
kept
the
feeling
in
check
she
reflected
that
for
the
majority
of
human
beings
the
best
possibilities
of
life
never
blossom
into
fruit
her
marriage
had
no
element
of
ideal
perfection
it
belonged
merely
to
the
common
ruck
of
such
arrangements
and
on
the
whole
it
was
the
best
scheme
of
existence
open
to
both
ted
loves
me
she
thought
and
if
i
can
never
love
him
in
the
same
way
i
can
at
least
tolerate
him
and
be
faithful
to
him
even
in
thought
it
was
never
possible
for
the
women
of
our
race
to
be
otherwise
and
then
i
am
safe
from
the
slow
canker
of
disillusionment
perhaps
in
the
years
to
come
i
may
find
it
possible
to
think
the
spring
days
at
lullaboolagana
as
a
beautiful
dream
happily
secured
from
the
corrosion
of
actual
there
was
a
burning
flush
on
her
cheeks
and
a
hard
brilliancy
in
her
eyes
as
she
raised
her
head
and
put
her
arms
round
her
mother
s
neck
my
darling
wherever
you
may
be
morning
and
night
join
your
thoughts
with
mine
in
prayer
said
her
mother
and
when
moments
of
perplexity
come
to
you
never
forget
the
words
in
your
patience
ye
shall
win
your
souls
in
your
patience
words
haunted
her
strangely
in
the
silent
watches
of
the
night
patience
the
great
keynote
of
nature
of
god
so
far
as
we
can
apprehend
him
of
man
so
far
as
he
can
rise
to
accomplish
aught
that
is
to
nourish
or
deliver
his
kind
that
old
gospel
of
the
discipline
of
sorrow
and
pain
how
fiercely
she
had
come
to
spurn
it
to
turn
from
it
as
the
rock
on
which
human
lives
were
ineffectually
offered
up
a
very
moloch
that
demanded
all
and
gave
in
return
a
grave
and
pale
glimmering
of
a
future
life
so
far
removed
from
earth
and
sense
that
its
possession
was
a
very
doubtful
gain
and
and
sorrow
what
nobility
has
man
attained
without
these
what
steadfast
purpose
has
he
achieved
would
the
years
here
have
been
in
truth
so
unbearable
as
she
had
pictured
surrounded
with
all
the
precious
charities
of
serene
at
last
in
utter
impatience
she
turned
from
all
these
doubts
and
questions
as
mere
rags
of
rhetoric
that
hid
from
her
the
true
bearings
of
what
her
life
would
become
it
is
because
i
am
going
to
leave
it
all
that
there
seems
to
be
healing
in
the
thought
of
resignation
and
leisured
quiet
and
daily
communion
with
nature
and
great
thoughts
there
would
be
no
end
to
these
eventless
days
and
the
prospect
stretching
out
before
me
would
have
frozen
me
into
one
of
those
whimlings
to
whom
nothing
is
so
real
as
the
wan
promises
of
joy
that
fade
into
nothing
it
has
always
made
me
incredibly
dreary
when
i
have
seen
people
stranded
in
some
little
inlet
of
existence
growing
gray
and
faded
in
trying
to
persuade
themselves
that
life
is
not
without
savour
because
once
on
a
time
they
were
going
to
be
were
going
to
hear
music
but
the
harmony
never
began
with
ted
i
shall
at
least
keep
hold
on
some
of
the
realities
of
she
even
laughed
a
little
as
she
recalled
the
way
in
which
ted
had
attempted
to
reconcile
her
to
the
prospect
of
being
so
much
in
his
on
the
subject
in
his
eminently
practical
direct
way
as
they
rode
that
morning
beyond
coromandel
valley
she
had
lingered
looking
at
the
views
so
familiar
and
from
childhood
wide
fertile
valleys
irradiated
with
running
water
dotted
with
prosperous
homesteads
folded
in
by
vines
and
olives
and
surrounded
by
fertile
fields
and
orchards
sloping
hillsides
clothed
with
slender
gullies
masked
with
the
unbroken
shadow
of
tall
slim
stringy
bark
trees
growing
so
thick
together
that
one
could
scarcely
walk
between
them
and
then
those
first
glimpses
of
the
silver
line
of
the
sea
on
their
return
sparkling
in
the
distance
through
the
quiet
shadowy
woods
like
the
beginning
of
a
fresh
mysterious
world
how
often
had
the
sight
thrilled
her
with
thoughts
of
the
great
old
classic
countries
famous
in
song
and
story
which
lay
far
beyond
those
countless
leagues
of
dividing
whose
history
and
stores
of
man
s
highest
achievements
make
so
strong
a
claim
on
spirits
touched
to
sympathy
with
the
wider
issues
of
human
life
all
was
now
within
her
reach
but
as
she
looked
her
farewells
at
these
primeval
woods
at
the
calm
beautiful
uncommemorated
scenes
of
her
native
land
a
great
pain
had
fastened
upon
her
pain
dull
deep
and
insatiable
that
made
her
pulses
beat
slowly
mechanically
as
if
it
were
sapping
her
don
t
look
like
that
stella
ted
had
said
after
a
long
silence
you
will
see
these
places
all
again
as
often
as
you
like
we
can
spend
part
of
each
summer
among
the
hills
did
you
know
my
father
is
going
to
settle
wattle
cottage
on
pretty
little
house
on
one
of
the
spurs
of
mount
lofty
oh
mercy
ted
is
there
no
end
to
the
possessions
that
are
to
be
heaped
on
me
and
then
i
must
not
even
take
the
liberty
of
looking
a
little
sad
because
i
am
a
glorified
edition
of
who
was
but
don
t
tell
me
if
it
s
one
of
those
wretched
little
yarns
you
make
up
with
some
sort
of
a
ghost
in
is
never
a
ghost
or
a
banshee
or
a
lost
soul
in
it
is
quite
after
your
own
heart
wilt
thou
be
mine
thou
shalt
not
wash
dishes
nor
yet
feed
the
swine
but
sit
on
a
cushion
and
sew
a
fine
seam
and
feed
upon
strawberries
sugar
and
cream
but
the
girl
after
my
heart
is
fonder
of
a
saddle
than
a
cushion
i
was
reading
a
novel
the
other
night
stella
and
there
was
something
in
it
about
a
strong
bond
of
sympathy
between
the
young
man
and
woman
who
did
most
of
the
spooning
i
m
not
sure
i
know
exactly
what
the
fellow
meant
but
don
t
you
think
it
s
a
bond
of
sympathy
between
us
two
that
we
are
both
so
fond
of
horses
stella
recalled
all
this
and
some
more
seriously
personal
talk
that
followed
after
all
she
reflected
there
could
be
no
one
else
in
the
whole
world
she
would
marry
without
being
in
love
with
him
except
ted
in
the
midst
of
these
thoughts
she
fell
fast
asleep
alas
the
mysterious
phantasies
of
dreamland
were
not
so
reasonable
and
reassuring
as
her
last
waking
thoughts
she
dreamt
one
of
those
vivid
consecutive
dreams
with
which
she
had
become
increasingly
familiar
of
late
she
was
at
lullaboolagana
out
in
the
home
field
walking
with
anselm
langdale
my
beloved
there
is
no
one
between
one
he
was
saying
is
our
come
and
get
a
wreath
of
the
hymenosperum
that
is
what
i
want
you
to
wear
instead
of
they
went
down
beyond
the
oolloolloo
close
to
the
orchard
and
lo
there
was
the
hymenosperum
sheeted
with
blossoms
and
all
around
the
air
was
rent
with
songs
of
birds
and
the
whole
world
was
glad
and
surpassingly
like
the
holy
city
the
new
jerusalem
which
john
saw
coming
down
from
god
out
of
heaven
prepared
as
a
bride
adorned
for
her
husband
how
wide
and
full
was
the
tide
of
joy
that
welled
up
in
her
heart
how
starry
and
fragrant
were
the
flowers
they
plucked
together
for
her
bridal
wreath
the
sun
was
warm
in
their
faces
but
they
could
not
have
too
much
of
these
slender
pale
cream
blossoms
she
heard
herself
laughing
happily
and
then
anselm
held
her
face
to
his
and
kissed
her
repeatedly
my
darling
i
am
so
glad
to
hear
you
laugh
so
on
your
wedding
it
was
her
mother
who
was
kissing
her
softly
oh
it
is
quite
true
then
it
is
my
said
the
girl
starting
up
her
face
dyed
with
happy
blushes
and
then
her
mother
kissed
her
once
again
and
gently
left
her
thanking
god
that
her
fears
had
been
misplaced
for
on
the
previous
evening
some
curious
misgiving
had
crept
into
her
mind
but
now
she
knew
that
all
was
well
ritchie
had
called
a
little
after
sunrise
with
a
magnificent
bridal
bouquet
composed
entirely
of
white
fairy
rosebuds
shaded
with
maidenhair
fern
the
mother
had
taken
it
softly
into
her
daughter
s
room
the
windows
looking
eastward
were
wide
open
and
the
blinds
up
according
to
stella
s
invariable
custom
the
sunrays
were
falling
on
her
face
which
was
flushed
and
radiant
like
a
child
s
the
mother
s
heart
leaped
with
grateful
joy
and
when
she
heard
stella
still
slumbering
break
into
a
ripple
of
silvery
laughter
she
could
not
resist
stooping
to
kiss
her
awake
thank
god
my
child
is
so
happy
she
murmured
gently
as
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
xliv
summer
threatened
to
set
in
early
this
season
on
the
fourteenth
of
october
two
days
before
the
ritchies
were
to
sail
a
high
easterly
hot
wind
was
blowing
and
there
was
something
of
tropical
ardour
in
the
sun
it
was
exhaustingly
unseasonable
weather
at
monico
lodge
the
venetian
blinds
of
the
veranda
were
closely
drawn
and
there
was
that
hushed
darkened
aspect
throughout
the
house
which
almost
cheats
us
into
believing
that
without
the
sky
is
gray
and
cool
i
do
envy
you
straight
into
the
middle
of
a
northern
winter
said
laurette
fanning
herself
slowly
with
a
wide
fan
of
gray
curled
she
sat
opposite
to
her
in
the
and
as
she
noticed
the
sharpened
outline
of
her
face
and
the
hectic
flush
that
burned
steadily
in
her
cheeks
she
was
devoutly
thankful
that
the
pair
would
soon
be
afloat
she
is
quite
capable
of
having
a
downright
fever
thought
laurette
but
the
will
prevent
all
it
was
indeed
curious
to
notice
how
the
few
weeks
that
had
elapsed
since
stella
left
lullaboolagana
had
subtly
changed
the
character
and
expression
of
her
face
the
cold
look
which
sometimes
marked
it
before
when
in
repose
had
hardened
into
an
air
of
listless
hauteur
when
she
smiled
her
eyes
instead
of
sparkling
and
gleaming
with
soft
radiance
remained
brilliantly
hard
and
unmoved
we
are
at
times
almost
appalled
by
the
scornful
disdain
imprinted
on
women
s
countenances
do
not
let
us
judge
them
harshly
tolerance
is
not
the
prerogative
of
the
weaker
sex
but
often
their
most
savage
bigotry
of
blame
is
directed
against
the
into
which
they
have
been
cheated
by
circumstance
and
their
own
fatal
impatience
of
suffering
it
is
not
shallow
and
wilful
disesteem
of
others
that
makes
the
hardest
lines
in
their
faces
when
the
tie
which
is
the
fount
of
all
human
tenderness
proves
to
them
an
intolerable
bond
if
the
summer
is
to
go
on
from
now
till
march
we
certainly
must
take
a
little
cottage
at
kilda
or
brighton
laurette
went
on
raising
her
voice
a
little
doubting
whether
stella
heard
the
first
remark
before
she
could
make
any
response
to
this
the
door
was
hastily
opened
and
ted
came
in
isn
t
stella
here
he
seeing
her
at
first
in
the
shadowy
corner
in
which
she
sat
with
an
open
book
whose
leaves
she
did
not
turn
oh
there
you
are
why
the
deuce
do
you
make
the
house
like
a
cave
larry
he
cried
turning
to
his
sister
i
ll
go
and
amend
my
ways
this
instant
said
laurette
gliding
out
of
the
room
you
mustn
t
make
the
room
any
lighter
said
stella
in
a
languid
voice
why
i
thought
you
were
so
fond
of
light
and
heat
i
ve
often
found
you
in
blazing
december
weather
out
in
the
fairacre
garden
sitting
in
the
shade
without
even
a
hat
on
but
i
m
only
too
glad
to
hear
you
wish
for
anything
besides
i
m
going
away
for
the
rest
of
the
day
if
you
can
spare
oh
yes
where

to
randwick

two
or
three
other
fellows
and

four
or
five
more
colts
i
expect
john
morton

be
here
before

get
back
now
before
i
go
would
you
mind
telling
me
your
new
name
no
larks
stella
say
your
proper
newspaper
ted
don
t
be
tiresome
and
try
not
to
look
so
complacently
abominably
glad
it
makes
my
eyes
ache
most
people
never
look
so
silly
as
when
they
are
ted
laughed
in
an
exultant
way
by
george
i
hope
i
ll
always
look
silly
in
that
way
do
you
know
stella
you
haven
t
asked
me
to
do
a
single
thing
for
you
since
we
were
married
yesterday
three
hundred
and
years
ago
what
frightful
lies
people
tell
about
life
being
so
short
well
now
that
i
think
of
it
it
is
a
week
and
a
day
but
in
sober
earnest
stella
do
tell
me
one
little
morsel
i
can
do
for
you
i
m
aching
all
over
to
do
something
you
would
like
now
didn
t
i
tell
you
that
was
for
he
said
touching
the
at
her
throat
send
me
back
with
dustiefoot
and
maisie
to
strathhaye
till
you
and
me
go
to
foreign
countries
without
you
i
meant
something
that
i
could
do
stella
but
of
course
you
are
sly
little
do
you
know
what
you
said
in
your
sleep
last
night
ted
s
face
was
wreathed
with
smiles
but
though
the
flush
on
her
cheeks
did
not
die
away
a
certain
pallor
deepened
about
stella
s
mouth
and
eyes
did
i
speak
in
my
sleep
i
don
t
think
i
used
to
what
a
dangerous
accomplishment
to
evolve
dangerous
i
think
it
is
very
jolly
when
you
are
so
proud
turning
your
cheek
to
me
when
i
want
to
kiss
you
but
you
see
i
don
t
mind
when
you
give
yourself
away
in
your
dreams
calling
me
by
such
fond
names
you
are
making
that
up
as
you
go
along
ted
she
said
with
lowered
eyes
upon
my
soul
i
am
not
you
moaned
a
little
i
thought
you
were
having
a
bad
dream
and
i
stroked
your
cheek
and
then
you
sighed
and
heard
it
quite
dear
little
leaf
of
my
heart
now
you
know
you
never
said
anything
half
as
pretty
as
that
to
me
awake
there
don
t
go
so
scarlet
i
won
t
bring
it
up
against
you
if
you
put
your
two
arms
around
me
and
say
i
want
you
not
to
stay
too
long
away
ted
and
open
that
little
parcel
when
you
are
tired
of
reading
what
book
has
ever
been
written
that
can
enchain
the
mind
when
the
heart
is
throbbing
with
feverish
the
face
is
blistered
with
a
sense
of
scorching
shame
yes
she
had
put
up
her
hands
and
whispered
the
words
after
him
in
the
quiet
darkened
room
and
even
in
the
act
it
rose
up
before
her
like
one
of
the
scenes
in
the
inferno
which
stamp
themselves
on
the
mind
of
those
who
are
intimate
with
dante
s
divine
poem
like
lurid
pictures
that
have
been
absolutely
witnessed
she
seemed
to
see
herself
among
those
who
smote
their
hands
despairingly
above
their
heads
borne
along
in
ceaseless
tumult
in
the
atmosphere
eternally
darkened
as
with
sand
driven
by
the
whirlwind
a
sudden
catch
came
in
her
breath
she
unfastened
a
slender
ribbon
that
was
fastened
low
on
her
neck
and
drew
out
the
ring
that
she
had
daily
worn
against
her
heart
since
the
evening
she
had
parted
from
langdale
she
kissed
it
as
a
mother
kisses
the
face
of
her
dead
child
no
no
no
must
not
wear
it
she
moaned
i
must
drive
all
this
away
from
me
sleeping
and
waking
i
become
more
enslaved
with
these
memories
i
thought
to
drive
them
from
me
by
brute
put
a
barrier
between
them
and
my
heart
and
in
place
of
that
they
overwhelm
me
in
my
come
back
as
to
a
chamber
swept
and
garnished
and
now
i
learn
to
juggle
and
deceive
o
god
god
me
from
the
leprosy
of
falsehood
to
which
i
have
been
betrayed
yes
it
was
true
she
had
fought
down
soul
and
instinct
find
memory
with
ruthless
violence
but
nature
is
not
to
be
lightly
trifled
with
she
has
strange
nemesis
powers
which
find
their
own
modes
of
reprisal
what
the
girl
in
her
ignorance
had
dreamt
would
turn
her
love
and
fierce
jealousy
into
a
forsworn
perjured
and
impossible
passion
had
but
opened
its
floodgates
the
moment
sleep
came
to
her
the
uncontrolled
visions
of
unconsciousness
the
mysterious
play
of
the
brain
which
lies
awake
and
remembers
and
keeps
time
to
the
beating
of
the
heart
and
calls
up
all
the
masking
simulacrum
of
life
apart
from
our
volition
practised
the
cruellest
treacheries
upon
her
forces
which
had
hitherto
lain
dormant
in
her
nature
pulsed
into
being
only
to
reinforce
her
forbidden
love
the
thought
of
ted
s
untroubled
confidence
smote
on
her
conscience
with
intolerable
pain
she
saw
as
with
a
of
insight
all
the
falsity
and
degradation
of
her
position
she
would
tell
him
must
he
was
good
and
generous
to
her
he
would
have
patience
with
her
he
would
give
her
time
to
live
down
the
past
this
double
treacherous
existence
was
impossible
it
would
be
terrible
to
speak
to
him
of
she
would
make
him
understand
he
had
implored
her
to
let
him
do
something
for
her
and
he
would
not
go
back
from
this
wish
when
he
knew
all
she
would
make
her
confession
and
appeal
to
him
something
of
relief
came
gradually
with
the
thought
the
adamant
reserve
with
which
she
had
guarded
this
terrible
crisis
of
her
life
had
been
part
of
her
crushing
burden
yes
ted
would
forgive
her
and
when
the
keenness
of
anguish
and
memory
had
passed
away
she
would
be
a
true
and
loyal
wife
to
him
she
might
still
prove
in
a
faltering
imperfect
way
that
love
and
a
noble
life
are
one
there
was
a
white
gauze
scarf
looped
and
interwoven
in
front
of
the
pale
cashmere
morning
dress
she
wore
she
detached
this
scarf
and
taking
the
ring
with
the
narrow
white
ribbon
to
which
it
was
fastened
she
enveloped
it
fold
upon
fold
i
will
not
look
at
it
again
for
long
a
sudden
thought
came
to
her
that
she
would
think
of
langdale
as
and
taken
from
her
for
evermore
oh
my
love
my
love
my
love
she
cried
putting
down
her
head
and
suddenly
her
tears
fell
like
summer
rain
she
was
weeping
for
the
dead
yes
he
was
really
dead
to
lover
from
whom
she
had
parted
on
that
serene
night
when
heaven
was
flooded
as
with
the
twilight
of
dawn
and
the
soft
mystic
glow
crept
in
through
the
interlaced
foliage
which
hung
round
the
veranda
of
that
quiet
house
near
the
borders
of
the
peeloo
plain
never
again
would
they
stand
looking
with
radiant
faces
to
the
years
that
were
to
be
all
their
own
it
was
a
crime
to
love
him
but
she
might
weep
for
him
she
would
tame
this
wild
passion
which
came
stealthily
back
in
the
visions
of
the
night
when
reason
was
drugged
with
the
poppies
of
sleep
and
conscience
had
relaxed
its
vigilance
day
by
day
she
would
think
of
silent
graves
and
of
departed
ones
who
return
no
more
her
whole
frame
was
convulsed
with
a
storm
of
sobs
she
gave
herself
up
to
her
long
grief
till
its
very
intensity
brought
some
ray
of
consolation
she
had
been
so
hard
and
bitter
and
she
must
weep
for
her
dead
she
must
try
and
creep
back
to
god
whom
she
had
disbelieved
and
forgotten
he
had
wounded
her
so
incurably
it
must
be
that
he
knew
of
her
poor
maimed
existence
let
the
bells
toll
and
dust
be
given
back
to
dust
and
let
her
bow
her
head
and
her
heart
in
submissive
prayer
even
if
god
does
not
care
for
us
we
must
still
stumble
back
to
him
when
the
billows
of
dark
despair
dash
against
the
frail
skiff
in
which
we
are
launched
on
the
wild
uncertain
sea
of
life
she
had
joined
the
great
army
of
earth
s
bereaved
ones
the
inextinguishable
craving
of
the
heart
for
communion
in
prayer
overcame
her
crouching
low
with
folded
hands
and
face
the
words
rose
to
her
lips
joining
her
petitions
with
those
others
beaten
and
chastised
as
she
was
our
father
who
art
in
heaven
forgive
the
days
of
utter
rebellion
and
agony
and
despair
forgive
the
storms
of
unlighted
darkness
that
toss
our
souls
those
for
whom
we
poor
stricken
ones
mourn
are
in
thy
from
the
world
s
slow
stain
from
the
infirmities
of
old
age
from
the
bitterness
of
disillusion
from
the
subtle
decay
of
enthusiasm
for
all
that
is
good
and
great
they
have
reached
a
continuing
city
they
are
bathed
in
the
light
of
everlasting
life
the
currents
of
time
and
change
the
distraction
and
vainglory
and
delusion
of
the
touch
them
no
more
forever
our
father
we
would
that
thy
will
were
ours
we
would
fain
lift
up
our
eyes
to
thee
but
they
are
blinded
with
tears
yet
let
us
come
to
thee
infinite
source
of
all
good
though
our
only
offering
is
that
of
a
bruised
and
broken
and
sinful
heart
the
pangs
of
loneliness
and
isolation
the
rapturous
dream
of
happiness
changed
into
a
sword
within
the
bosom
the
desolation
of
days
emptied
of
are
the
poor
oblations
that
we
bring
yet
may
they
become
to
us
an
inspiration
and
a
stay
when
the
cruel
waves
of
anguish
overcome
us
when
despair
like
an
angry
sea
threatens
to
engulf
us
when
the
heavens
are
dark
and
starless
when
the
earth
seems
empty
of
all
that
makes
it
endurable
when
it
seems
given
over
to
the
hopeless
mediocrity
of
natures
mildewed
with
commonness
in
aim
intention
and
achievement
when
our
days
stretch
before
us
blank
and
purposeless
spent
and
disconnected
unmeaning
and
futile
as
grains
of
quicksand
that
a
great
storm
has
borne
far
inland
when
hope
is
dead
and
faith
far
off
and
fears
troop
round
us
like
a
horde
of
plotting
rebels
saying
there
is
no
immortality
when
the
mind
is
flooded
with
unbearable
recollections
of
lost
joy
when
we
are
listless
and
indifferent
and
overcome
with
fruitless
o
kindly
light
let
thoughts
of
thee
and
of
the
great
souls
whom
thou
hast
vivified
enlarge
our
natures
and
illuminate
our
her
sobs
died
into
silence
the
bitterness
of
her
grief
was
spent
the
door
was
opened
but
she
could
only
half
raise
her
head
and
tareling
who
caught
one
swift
glimpse
of
face
pallid
and
she
crouched
in
silence
like
some
dumb
creature
mortally
wounded
retreated
noiselessly
with
a
startled
almost
horrified
look
he
was
in
search
of
laurette
to
make
some
arrangements
for
the
evening
before
he
went
to
his
office
he
met
her
in
the
hall
what
is
the
matter
with
stella
he
asked
quickly
looking
at
his
wife
with
an
indefinable
suspicion
in
his
eyes
the
matter
with
stella
she
echoed
with
a
little
quick
throb
of
terror
which
she
kept
well
in
hand
however
nothing
that
i
know
that
she
has
too
many
diamond
sprays
and
necklaces
and
precious
stones
and
a
husband
who
adores
well
i
don
t
know
but
i
wouldn
t
mind
laying
a
thousand
to
one
that
there
was
some
sort
of
deception
at
the
root
of
this
marriage
it
s
not
a
month
since
she
came
here
from
lullaboolagana
looking
like
a
rose
in
in
december
you
mean
dear
our
roses
are
very
shabby
in
june
and
i
am
sure
stella
will
never
be
in
that
condition
oh
about
the
theatre
you
had
better
book
three
seats
in
the
for
us
two
and
john
morton
stella
won
t
come
and
of
course
ted
will
not
either
have
you
been
speaking
to
now
i
mean
no
i
should
say
she
is
hardly
fit
to
speak
to
of
joy
in
the
possession
of
ted
and
so
many
diamonds
i
laurette
felt
anxious
but
she
avoided
the
for
another
hour
when
she
went
in
she
found
stella
looking
very
pale
and
exhausted
but
composed
she
had
raised
one
of
the
blinds
and
sat
embroidering
near
the
there
was
something
in
the
expression
of
her
face
that
touched
laurette
with
a
sudden
sharp
thrill
of
compassion
it
was
no
longer
hard
and
listless
all
the
cold
scorn
had
gone
out
of
it
and
in
place
of
these
there
was
an
indescribable
wistful
eyelids
were
dark
and
slightly
swollen
and
when
she
looked
up
one
saw
that
her
beautiful
radiant
eyes
had
grown
heavy
and
dim
but
the
only
moral
and
politic
course
when
a
bride
looks
like
this
is
to
say
nothing
oh
what
have
we
here
said
laurette
in
a
way
holding
up
the
little
parcel
ted
had
left
now
if
you
are
not
dying
to
see
this
i
am
and
may
i
therefore
open
it
for
you
she
continued
stella
at
once
assented
it
was
a
case
containing
an
bracelet
set
with
extraordinarily
large
that
stella
happened
to
notice
in
a
jeweller
s
window
when
she
accompanied
ted
into
collins
street
after
reaching
melbourne
on
the
previous
afternoon
they
are
really
too
lovely
said
laurette
holding
them
up
so
that
they
caught
the
light
and
threw
it
back
in
a
sheaf
of
quivering
but
with
an
eerie
flame
not
to
be
found
in
a
rainbow
i
shall
be
afraid
to
admire
anything
after
this
except
the
sun
and
trees
said
stella
with
a
tremulous
little
smile
it
is
so
kind
of
ted
was
a
little
quiver
in
her
voice
and
laurette
suddenly
rose
and
kissed
her
you
are
not
well
stella
the
weather
is
so
atrocious
do
lie
down
and
let
me
bathe
your
but
stella
thanking
her
declared
there
was
not
much
amiss
she
would
have
been
glad
to
lie
down
but
she
felt
a
stupor
of
moral
and
physical
exhaustion
creeping
over
her
and
feared
to
give
way
to
that
the
purpose
she
had
formed
of
making
a
full
confession
to
her
husband
might
slip
from
her
when
he
returned
if
she
did
not
resist
this
benumbing
lassitude
in
the
afternoon
there
were
callers
and
stella
went
to
her
own
room
to
write
letters
home
the
effort
seemed
to
use
up
all
her
energies
but
she
dressed
and
sat
at
dinner
with
the
rest
though
eating
was
a
mere
farce
with
her
she
talked
for
some
little
time
with
tall
burly
man
with
dark
curly
hair
and
a
face
but
with
a
voice
and
manners
as
gentle
as
a
woman
s
she
wondered
a
little
that
ted
did
not
come
but
when
laurette
wished
to
stay
at
home
with
her
and
forego
the
theatre
stella
insisted
on
being
left
alone
it
will
not
be
long
before
ted
comes
she
said
i
will
rest
till
laurette
made
her
lie
down
on
the
sofa
in
the
before
she
went
away
but
soon
after
being
left
alone
stella
went
into
the
which
was
beyond
the
and
communicated
with
it
by
folding
doors
here
she
was
in
darkness
except
for
the
light
that
came
in
from
the
the
gas
seemed
to
beat
upon
her
tired
eyes
with
such
wearying
brilliance
she
found
the
change
to
the
unlighted
room
very
grateful
she
opened
the
window
of
this
little
room
and
lay
opposite
to
it
on
the
couch
looking
out
at
the
starlit
sky
at
every
sound
she
heard
her
heart
seemed
to
beat
in
her
ears
the
moment
ted
came
in
she
must
tell
must
not
give
herself
time
to
reflect
and
draw
back
she
knew
it
would
hurt
him
as
well
as
herself
horribly
and
yet
she
had
confidence
in
him
that
he
would
not
be
harsh
or
ungenerous
he
would
help
would
understand
already
with
all
her
agitation
she
felt
something
of
the
relief
of
being
freed
from
the
concealment
which
his
own
loyalty
made
all
the
more
intolerable
gradually
her
thoughts
became
light
of
the
stars
was
dimmed
with
the
pale
glory
of
a
young
moon
the
wind
which
had
been
high
all
day
still
rose
into
fitful
gusts
swaying
the
scanty
branches
of
a
that
grew
near
the
window
hither
and
thither
she
was
out
in
the
fairacre
yet
she
was
looking
into
laurette
s
house
and
she
saw
a
form
she
knew
well
approaching
it
she
heard
him
asking
for
her
and
then
gradually
all
floated
from
her
view
then
there
came
a
troubled
dream
in
which
she
heard
heavy
uncertain
sounded
near
her
and
yet
they
were
not
mixed
up
with
any
story
she
was
conscious
of
the
thought
that
these
stumbling
sounds
were
real
not
part
of
a
yet
she
did
not
wake
up
she
had
no
conception
how
long
she
had
slept
when
she
became
conscious
of
a
low
murmur
of
voices
no
it
was
not
a
dream
the
moonlight
had
faded
for
the
moon
was
setting
she
rose
temples
were
throbbing
one
leaf
of
the
double
between
the
little
apartment
and
the
was
half
ajar
the
murmur
of
voices
resolved
itself
into
words
it
was
laurette
who
spoke
stella
is
in
her
own
room
she
must
not
what
has
happened
cried
stella
gliding
quickly
into
the
laurette
in
a
silk
as
she
had
returned
from
the
theatre
was
standing
by
the
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
tareling
and
morton
were
near
her
but
ted
was
not
there
the
quick
look
of
consternation
on
all
three
faces
as
she
entered
gave
stella
a
sickening
sensation
of
fear
then
before
any
could
speak
she
saw
why
they
looked
so
strangely
one
lay
on
the
couch
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
breathing
heavily
but
pale
and
still
it
was
ted
and
with
a
low
cry
stella
knelt
down
by
him
oh
ted
ted
you
are
hurt
do
not
hear
me
she
held
his
were
cold
and
his
eyes
were
not
quite
closed
but
there
was
no
sign
of
awakening
my
god
what
has
happened
he
is
unconscious
she
cried
the
men
looked
at
her
in
a
strange
way
but
did
not
answer
no
dear
he
is
not
badly
hurt
said
laurette
she
was
very
white
and
her
hands
trembled
as
she
tried
to
raise
stella
how
has
he
been
hurt
you
must
tell
me
she
cried
turning
to
tareling
and
morton
laurette
made
despairing
gestures
to
them
as
she
stood
behind
stella
that
they
should
leave
the
room
but
they
were
so
confused
that
they
did
not
perceive
this
or
if
they
did
failed
to
understand
the
drift
of
laurette
s
motions
it
is
not
dangerous
stella
said
tareling
in
a
low
voice
taking
her
hand
in
both
his
did
the
doctor
say
so
cried
stella
has
he
gone
away
i
must
see
him
for
myself
has
he
been
long
unconscious
very
said
laurette
but
what
did
the
doctor
say
what
caused
this
stella
it
is
not
dangerous
you
may
believe
knows
said
laurette
desperately
if
only
these
stupid
men
were
out
of
the
way
she
felt
sure
she
could
invent
an
illness
or
at
any
rate
make
up
a
fictitious
account
of
the
doctor
s
opinion
not
dangerous
lie
like
this
she
knelt
down
again
and
held
ted
s
hands
and
whispered
his
name
softly
two
or
three
times
but
there
was
not
a
tremor
of
consciousness
the
perspiration
stood
on
john
morton
s
forehead
in
great
drops
my
dear
young
he
said
placing
his
hand
kindly
on
stella
s
shoulder
but
then
utterance
failed
him
ah
you
are
deceiving
me
you
can
see
look
at
each
other
so
strangely
talbot
she
said
going
up
to
her
you
must
tell
me
the
whole
truth
it
is
no
use
keeping
it
from
me
tell
me
what
the
doctor
said
the
began
tareling
the
fact
is
stella
an
attack
like
medical
attendance
is
not
usual
men
know
what
ought
to
be
done
it
form
of
a
conviction
had
seized
stella
that
ted
must
have
been
dangerously
hurt
and
that
all
these
blundering
equivocations
were
efforts
to
break
the
news
gently
to
her
do
you
mean
that
you
have
not
called
in
a
doctor
at
all
she
said
looking
from
morton
to
tareling
and
back
again
at
morton
he
poor
man
could
do
nothing
but
wipe
his
face
and
crush
his
handkerchief
into
a
minute
compass
stella
dear
you
may
believe
talbot
said
laurette
once
more
everything
has
been
done
that
is
necessary
ted
will
be
all
right
when
he
wakes
up
a
few
hours
wakes
up
repeated
stella
looking
at
the
group
around
her
with
a
sharp
thrill
of
terror
she
saw
that
morton
was
somehow
the
one
most
keenly
affected
laurette
tried
to
cajole
her
talbot
was
infinitely
gentle
in
his
manner
yet
confused
as
she
had
never
seen
him
before
but
john
morton
s
face
was
a
picture
of
distress
and
yearning
pity
going
up
to
him
stella
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
said
in
a
firm
voice
mr
morton
i
insist
upon
knowing
the
truth
there
is
something
you
keep
back
from
me
tell
me
in
one
word
is
ted
badly
hurt
if
not
what
ails
him
you
know
i
am
sure
you
he
is
not
badly
hurt
in
one
way
this
is
not
in
one
way
sha
gasped
with
parching
in
what
way
is
such
protracted
unconsciousness
not
serious
morton
had
for
some
years
worked
a
pearling
boat
off
the
unknown
northern
coasts
of
western
australia
and
had
been
a
spectator
and
an
actor
in
many
wild
scenes
but
never
had
he
known
so
acutely
miserable
a
quarter
of
an
hour
as
the
present
well
he
said
slowly
thus
driven
to
bay
perhaps
it
is
serious
in
every
way
only
not
as
you
think
you
know
the
day
has
been
very
and
the
sun
put
in
laurette
often
affects
people
without
a
regular
but
stella
did
not
even
notice
her
a
glimmering
suspicion
had
dawned
on
her
talbot
glided
out
of
the
room
tell
me
the
truth
said
stella
in
a
husky
voice
still
keeping
her
hand
on
morton
s
arm
i
thought
you
knew
something
of
this
weakness
of
ted
s
that
he
himself
takes
a
little
more
stimulant
than
is
good
for
a
low
moaning
cry
escaped
from
stella
and
she
trembled
convulsively
as
if
in
an
they
tried
to
draw
her
away
but
she
would
not
go
she
stood
as
if
white
and
looking
at
ted
s
insensible
form
and
ghastly
unmeaning
face
xlv
stella
could
never
recall
how
the
rest
of
the
night
passed
she
had
vague
recollections
of
sitting
as
if
turned
to
stone
of
hearing
voices
of
speaking
herself
now
and
then
of
pacing
at
intervals
up
and
down
the
room
like
some
creature
of
the
woods
that
had
been
suddenly
trapped
but
look
what
way
she
would
ted
s
vacant
face
met
her
eyes
she
could
hardly
be
said
to
suffer
acutely
she
was
rather
in
a
waking
trance
in
which
the
events
of
the
past
month
rose
up
before
her
like
a
curious
panorama
of
which
she
was
merely
a
spectator
once
or
twice
she
found
herself
planning
a
secret
away
into
unknown
haunts
of
the
desert
where
she
might
escape
from
these
endless
stratagems
that
fate
was
practising
upon
her
but
no
coherent
plan
underlay
these
vague
flights
they
belonged
rather
to
those
imaginative
variations
which
we
sometimes
make
in
a
story
that
is
distasteful
at
daybreak
ritchie
showed
signs
of
returning
consciousness
not
till
then
could
stella
be
prevailed
on
to
leave
the
room
laurette
pleaded
with
her
to
lie
down
and
rest
but
in
vain
no
one
knows
of
this
but
ourselves
she
said
when
we
got
home
from
the
theatre
we
found
ted
rather
confused
he
had
taken
a
little
raw
brandy
to
steady
his
nerves
and
that
of
course
was
a
fatal
mistake
it
was
an
unseasonably
hot
day
and
no
doubt
he
had
taken
some
long
drinks
stella
looked
at
her
strangely
but
said
not
a
word
in
reply
she
bathed
and
changed
her
dress
and
went
out
into
the
little
garden
at
monico
lodge
and
looked
at
the
sun
rising
with
eyes
that
saw
nothing
her
emotion
and
resolutions
of
the
previous
day
rose
up
before
her
in
so
mocking
and
sardonic
a
light
after
a
little
time
she
was
joined
by
john
morton
he
too
had
slept
but
little
stella
will
you
let
me
speak
to
you
as
if
you
were
a
sister
he
said
taking
her
hand
in
his
you
must
not
think
that
this
is
habitual
with
ted
it
is
only
a
couple
of
years
since
he
began
to
forget
himself
now
and
he
is
mixed
up
with
these
fast
turf
people
i
asked
him
a
few
weeks
before
he
was
married
whether
you
knew
of
he
said
laurette
told
him
you
had
heard
something
this
is
the
first
time
such
a
thing
has
happened
since
he
was
in
the
the
retreat
what
retreat
you
remember
when
ted
was
at
home
about
you
went
to
a
at
his
father
s
house
ah
i
remember
cried
stella
and
all
the
details
of
that
event
and
ted
s
altered
demeanour
when
he
came
to
bid
her
farewell
rushed
back
on
her
mind
yes
he
told
me
all
about
it
there
is
a
private
retreat
in
the
western
district
of
victoria
and
ted
in
his
disgust
at
finding
that
even
the
prospect
of
meeting
you
did
not
serve
to
keep
him
straight
went
there
for
nearly
six
months
it
is
only
when
he
is
with
when
he
is
a
little
tells
on
him
i
am
certain
he
will
keep
straight
after
this
i
know
it
must
vex
you
terribly
but
stella
you
must
not
be
too
angry
ted
sent
me
to
ask
you
to
see
him
he
is
more
unhappy
than
words
can
stella
went
slowly
into
the
house
laurette
met
her
in
the
hall
and
led
her
into
the
where
ted
stood
pallid
and
miserable
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
laurette
would
have
left
them
but
stella
called
her
back
there
was
something
so
cold
and
unmoved
in
her
face
and
voice
that
ted
s
heart
sank
if
possible
more
than
before
but
his
range
of
expression
was
limited
i
know
i
have
been
a
thundering
jackass
stella
he
said
in
a
husky
voice
i
don
t
know
how
to
ask
you
to
forgive
do
you
suppose
i
do
not
she
said
in
a
level
voice
don
t
say
you
forgive
me
when
you
look
like
that
stella
said
ted
i
know
you
have
a
right
to
be
but
i
am
not
any
more
than
if
you
had
or
if
it
were
a
merely
physical
malady
you
would
soon
recover
but
what
hope
is
there
for
a
vice
that
wrecks
the
will
so
vice
that
overcomes
a
man
till
he
lies
sunk
below
the
level
of
the
brutes
the
words
were
harsh
yet
what
added
curiously
to
their
force
was
the
quiet
passionless
tone
in
which
they
were
uttered
and
the
involuntary
shudder
which
shook
stella
from
head
to
foot
as
she
spoke
ritchie
flushed
crimson
and
for
a
little
he
did
not
speak
do
you
mean
he
said
at
last
very
slowly
that
i
am
not
to
be
blamed
for
this
because
if
you
do
you
are
very
much
mistaken
i
am
to
blame
most
damnably
and
i
have
been
worse
than
an
idiot
and
i
say
it
ever
happens
why
did
you
say
i
knew
something
of
this
said
stella
suddenly
turning
to
laurette
without
making
any
reply
to
her
husband
s
affirmations
well
i
made
sure
you
did
by
your
manner
and
that
long
talk
we
had
before
you
went
to
lull
said
laurette
composedly
meeting
her
brother
s
doubting
scrutiny
without
flinching
stella
put
up
her
hands
to
her
temples
struggling
to
recollect
what
the
long
talk
was
and
then
laurette
marshalling
her
forces
went
on
with
calm
incisiveness
you
have
seen
very
little
of
the
world
yet
stella
you
have
been
dreaming
over
romances
and
poetry
and
foolish
scientific
books
and
they
make
you
feel
as
if
you
knew
a
great
deal
you
have
several
brothers
and
are
intimate
with
a
good
many
of
their
friends
you
never
saw
any
of
them
the
worse
for
drink
so
you
conclude
they
never
in
their
lives
fell
fast
asleep
with
their
on
that
is
a
little
discovery
which
is
generally
reserved
for
the
sacred
privacy
of
married
life
take
my
word
for
it
there
are
very
few
families
without
one
or
more
in
the
same
boat
with
ted
only
unfortunately
many
have
no
power
of
pulling
themselves
up
as
he
has
now
stella
let
me
advise
you
to
rest
for
some
hours
you
know
this
is
your
last
day
before
stella
who
stood
gazing
out
of
the
window
most
of
the
time
while
laurette
spoke
upon
this
turned
and
looking
at
ted
without
any
trace
of
emotion
in
her
voice
said
slowly
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
live
with
you
as
your
wife
nothing
can
alter
my
determination
in
that
and
before
ted
could
say
anything
in
reply
she
left
the
room
he
stood
for
a
minute
or
two
as
if
stunned
and
then
walked
in
an
aimless
way
to
the
window
without
saying
a
word
but
after
a
little
he
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
dizziness
and
sank
half
fainting
on
a
chair
that
stood
near
laurette
insisted
upon
his
going
to
bed
and
installed
herself
as
his
nurse
this
proved
to
be
an
eventful
day
in
laurette
s
life
the
english
mail
which
arrived
that
morning
by
the
express
train
from
adelaide
brought
among
other
letters
one
from
his
father
to
tareling
with
the
announcement
that
his
eldest
brother
cecil
had
suddenly
been
stricken
down
with
a
stroke
of
paralysis
and
that
the
physicians
held
out
no
hope
of
his
ultimate
recovery
though
there
was
no
immediate
prospect
of
death
lord
harewood
had
been
ten
years
married
and
his
family
consisted
of
two
daughters
the
youngest
seven
years
of
age
the
earl
of
lillimore
was
and
frail
for
his
years
and
talbot
was
the
second
son
in
the
first
moments
after
receiving
this
intelligence
laurette
was
conscious
only
of
a
great
and
solemn
thankfulness
only
for
her
undaunted
efforts
talbot
who
might
after
this
at
any
moment
be
called
in
the
kind
ordinance
of
providence
to
take
his
place
among
the
peers
of
great
britain
would
now
be
ploughing
the
main
in
the
society
of
a
disreputable
actress
the
next
moment
she
was
more
than
ever
alive
to
the
necessity
of
taking
instant
action
lest
stella
should
in
her
unreasonable
caprice
decide
not
to
go
abroad
in
another
fortnight
at
the
most
there
would
be
a
letter
from
langdale
posted
at
mauritius
if
stella
remained
in
australia
laurette
could
do
nothing
to
prevent
her
receiving
this
or
any
subsequent
letter
whereas
in
her
absence
speedily
write
a
note
to
courtland
asking
that
any
letters
which
came
from
abroad
might
be
forwarded
to
obedience
to
stella
s
wish
she
knew
the
scrupulous
way
in
which
the
courtlands
would
fall
in
with
an
arrangement
of
this
kind
without
comment
or
inquiry
something
would
no
doubt
turn
up
some
day
which
would
make
stella
think
that
there
had
been
some
extraordinary
misunderstandings
then
at
that
time
laurette
might
be
safely
established
among
the
hereditary
aristocracy
of
europe
her
husband
an
little
son
a
lord
at
the
thought
laurette
could
not
forbear
going
into
the
nursery
and
clasping
the
future
lord
harewood
fondly
to
her
bosom
yes
there
were
occasions
in
life
on
which
one
must
act
for
the
present
and
not
for
eternity
or
even
the
remote
future
who
was
it
that
advised
people
to
take
short
views
in
life
the
counsel
was
sagacious
enough
for
solomon
himself
for
after
all
no
people
were
more
egregiously
sacrificed
at
times
than
those
who
trusted
nothing
to
the
chapter
of
accidents
laurette
stole
softly
into
the
darkened
room
in
which
ted
lay
he
looked
up
eagerly
thinking
it
might
be
stella
at
sight
of
laurette
he
closed
his
eyes
in
dejected
weariness
ted
you
must
arrange
that
your
voyage
is
not
postponed
she
said
sitting
by
his
bedside
i
don
t
see
the
good
of
arranging
anything
if
stella
sticks
to
what
she
says
and
i
believe
she
fiddlesticks
no
doubt
she
will
for
a
time
but
she
has
a
strong
sense
of
humour
and
she
will
soon
perceive
what
a
ridiculous
attitude
she
takes
up
but
at
the
same
time
it
becomes
you
to
make
concessions
and
i
will
be
your
what
do
you
mean
by
concessions
give
in
to
her
whim
till
you
can
get
her
to
relent
she
can
not
cease
to
be
edward
ritchie
because
sometimes
you
are
not
as
steady
as
you
should
be
but
if
she
is
wilful
there
may
be
no
end
of
scandal
and
annoyance
and
trouble
that
will
only
widen
the
breach
ask
her
to
start
with
you
as
arranged
on
her
own
conditions
or
i
will
speak
for
you
and
then
bring
her
in
here
to
clinch
the
laurette
found
stella
in
her
own
room
she
was
still
curiously
unmoved
laurette
told
a
melting
tale
of
ted
s
utter
unhappiness
and
remorse
no
stella
was
not
angry
nor
unforgiving
but
she
could
not
alter
her
decision
did
she
then
propose
to
separate
from
ted
she
did
not
know
it
was
all
so
dark
and
horrible
she
could
not
see
her
way
she
must
send
for
cuthbert
perhaps
he
would
help
her
to
think
what
was
right
she
knew
there
was
one
crime
she
must
not
commit
the
story
of
her
friend
cicely
s
life
rose
up
before
her
and
she
for
the
first
time
since
this
disastrous
revelation
burst
on
her
shed
a
few
scalding
humiliated
tears
what
crime
do
you
mean
said
laurette
in
a
whisper
the
crime
of
adding
to
the
lives
in
the
world
said
stella
in
a
dry
stern
voice
what
a
dreadful
idea
to
take
up
said
laurette
indignantly
why
talbot
drinks
three
times
as
hard
as
ted
ever
did
and
i
am
sure
neither
gwendolen
nor
howard
is
ever
likely
to
be
paralyzed
and
there
s
my
has
drunk
pretty
heavily
at
times
for
the
last
years
and
who
is
more
respected
than
he
of
the
house
for
so
long
and
knighted
and
all
the
rest
of
it
though
laurette
was
oblivious
of
that
elementary
canon
of
heredity
that
the
further
back
a
quality
has
been
fixed
the
more
likely
it
is
to
reappear
her
sharp
eyes
saw
that
her
illustration
conveyed
no
comfort
of
course
she
said
going
on
in
an
altered
tone
if
you
want
to
send
ted
completely
to
the
dogs
you
will
turn
your
back
on
him
now
you
ought
by
rights
to
have
married
him
four
years
i
ought
to
have
been
told
of
ted
s
you
seem
to
have
prevented
his
telling
me
the
truth
said
stella
in
a
low
hard
voice
well
i
may
have
been
to
blame
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
have
an
only
brother
you
may
be
thankful
you
were
never
tempted
in
the
same
way
not
many
of
us
fall
into
temptations
that
do
not
beset
us
if
there
were
a
sort
of
greek
chorus
going
on
always
to
warn
women
off
all
the
possible
shoals
of
matrimony
the
world
would
soon
come
to
a
nice
pass
you
all
blame
me
it
is
quite
plain
that
in
this
matter
i
am
the
earthenware
pot
going
down
the
stream
with
copper
kettles
but
if
it
was
all
to
come
over
again
i
couldn
t
act
differently
here
was
ted
hanging
after
you
ever
since
he
was
a
little
shrimp
in
his
first
knickerbockers
never
thought
of
any
other
girl
in
his
least
not
to
marry
her
uncle
was
a
old
man
who
insisted
on
ted
leaving
college
when
he
was
sixteen
because
he
said
a
squatter
would
never
want
more
than
to
write
and
see
that
a
could
add
up
properly
and
then
before
he
was
twenty
ted
is
left
his
own
master
with
thirteen
thousand
a
year
and
since
that
he
has
raised
the
annual
income
of
the
station
to
fifteen
thousand
it
s
ridiculous
to
speak
as
if
he
were
a
slave
to
drink
or
anything
like
it
it
s
only
when
he
goes
with
that
eversley
and
wilmot
now
he
s
got
you
he
ll
see
precious
little
of
laurette
spoke
in
a
clear
emphatic
voice
and
she
could
see
that
some
of
her
arguments
went
home
though
stella
made
no
response
the
thought
of
her
sending
for
cuthbert
had
terror
in
it
if
only
for
the
reason
that
such
a
course
would
prevent
the
pair
from
leaving
by
the
and
if
any
delay
arose
with
so
many
awkward
contingencies
in
the
background
no
one
could
tell
what
might
happen
come
stella
you
must
forgive
ted
oh
i
what
s
the
good
of
that
sort
of
forgiveness
i
don
t
want
you
to
be
hanged
or
that
won
t
do
my
dear
i
am
a
wife
and
mother
and
my
experience
of
life
is
much
more
matured
than
yours
take
my
word
for
it
forgiveness
is
the
quality
that
best
suits
us
when
we
are
most
sinned
against
it
does
not
become
us
to
be
too
logical
or
look
too
far
ahead
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
god
made
our
brains
smaller
than
those
of
men
where
would
i
be
and
my
two
little
ones
if
i
had
not
swallowed
a
great
deal
more
than
ever
you
will
have
to
overlook
laurette
i
have
no
doubt
you
mean
very
well
said
stella
wearily
i
do
not
want
to
make
a
public
scandal
sail
as
was
arranged
stella
and
make
your
own
conditions
till
you
are
satisfied
that
the
episode
of
yesterday
was
an
accident
which
won
t
happen
again
now
be
reasonable
and
tell
me
what
other
plan
could
cuthbert
or
even
an
angel
from
heaven
suggest
better
than
this
what
sacredness
would
the
marriage
service
have
if
men
and
women
tried
to
throw
the
contract
over
at
the
first
shock
come
on
stella
and
speak
to
when
stella
went
into
her
husband
s
room
the
sight
of
his
haggard
face
with
its
broken
appealing
look
smote
on
her
heart
stella
forgive
me
he
said
speaking
very
low
lest
he
should
betray
emotion
i
do
she
said
with
bent
head
i
do
forgive
you
and
stella
don
t
say
you
don
t
blame
me
any
more
than
if
i
had
i
would
sooner
somehow
you
thought
i
was
as
black
as
the
devil
himself
than
believe
i
couldn
t
help
being
such
an
infernal
but
ted
you
know
how
less
than
a
year
ago
when
you
were
to
meet
me
at
your
father
s
the
same
thing
happened
and
i
not
know
that
you
would
not
willingly
give
me
pain
thank
you
for
saying
that
stella
may
i
hold
your
hand
i
know
all
yet
this
time
it
s
partly
i
know
because
i
got
into
my
head
you
knew
and
didn
t
mind
so
very
much
larry
made
some
mistake
and
she
thought
you
knew
and
then
you
know
i
wanted
to
tell
you
when
i
said
i
wasn
t
what
i
ought
to
you
said
rather
queer
things
of
course
it
was
because
you
didn
t
really
know
i
never
was
so
ashamed
of
myself
in
my
life
before
and
i
ll
do
whatever
you
want
me
oh
ted
it
is
all
too
miserable
it
seems
as
if
the
things
that
are
worst
in
life
pursued
us
and
hounded
us
down
so
that
we
can
not
escape
that
we
can
not
help
a
scalding
tear
rolled
down
stella
s
cheek
and
fell
on
ted
s
hand
then
so
extreme
was
his
misery
and
remorse
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
moaned
aloud
the
thought
crossed
stella
s
mind
that
she
would
tell
him
all
she
meant
to
say
on
the
previous
night
but
the
sight
of
his
motionless
form
and
ghastly
vacant
face
as
he
lay
submerged
far
below
the
unconsciousness
of
brute
life
rose
before
her
with
cruel
vividness
and
then
she
knew
that
she
dared
not
breathe
a
word
to
him
of
her
irremediable
bereavement
it
would
be
the
oil
for
common
purposes
from
the
lamp
that
burned
in
commemoration
of
her
dead
but
a
hard
unsympathetic
antagonism
was
impossible
to
her
she
was
too
keenly
alive
to
the
tragic
element
in
human
the
multiform
aspects
in
which
circumstance
destiny
chance
it
what
we
often
wove
the
pattern
of
our
lives
with
cynical
disregard
of
the
designs
that
make
for
their
salvation
and
happiness
as
ted
looked
at
her
with
dim
appealing
eyes
she
was
sorry
for
him
beyond
the
reach
of
words
yet
she
was
inflexible
in
the
resolve
that
till
the
memory
of
the
past
had
grown
more
dim
and
till
the
ascendancy
of
his
fatal
weakness
was
disproved
their
lives
must
virtually
be
lived
apart
but
we
can
help
can
yet
make
it
all
right
stella
he
said
in
answer
to
her
words
only
let
me
be
near
me
be
with
me
look
at
you
day
by
me
do
things
for
you
it
was
on
the
of
last
december
that
i
forgot
myself
before
if
on
this
day
twelve
months
i
can
tell
you
honestly
that
during
all
that
time
i
have
not
made
such
a
horrible
blunder
will
you
believe
that
i
can
help
making
a
fool
of
myself
and
live
with
me
as
my
wife
will
you
stella
she
made
answer
that
she
would
and
then
he
clasped
both
her
hands
in
a
fervent
grasp
we
will
travel
during
that
year
stella
he
went
on
and
laurette
the
room
as
he
spoke
we
will
sail
as
we
meant
laurette
s
face
was
a
little
flushed
her
heart
rose
with
a
bound
you
have
given
your
promise
ted
and
i
am
sure
you
will
keep
to
it
i
will
read
a
verse
or
two
to
make
you
remember
it
laurette
who
had
the
dramatic
faculty
in
some
respects
to
a
remarkable
degree
caught
up
a
new
testament
that
lay
on
the
knelt
down
by
the
bedside
and
opening
the
book
at
random
read
the
first
verses
on
which
her
eyes
fell
and
the
lord
commended
the
unjust
steward
forasmuch
as
he
had
done
wisely
for
the
children
of
this
world
are
wiser
in
their
generation
than
the
children
of
light
and
i
say
to
you
make
unto
you
friends
of
the
mammon
of
iniquity
that
when
you
shall
fail
they
may
receive
you
into
everlasting
dwellings
laurette
rose
from
her
knees
and
put
away
the
testament
feeling
for
her
own
part
deeply
encouraged
and
reassured
she
had
heard
something
of
the
practice
of
reading
a
verse
or
verses
where
the
bible
happened
to
open
and
her
present
experience
gave
her
the
belief
that
there
was
something
in
it
as
far
as
she
had
known
anything
of
the
sect
of
the
children
of
light
they
were
often
in
practical
matters
conies
of
the
rocks
and
she
was
well
content
to
be
of
those
who
made
friends
of
the
mammon
of
iniquity
which
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
biblical
nickname
for
worldly
prudence
as
for
stella
the
feeling
overcame
her
more
strongly
than
ever
that
she
was
looking
on
at
dioramic
views
in
a
troubled
dream
or
that
she
was
a
supernumerary
in
a
opera
in
which
people
spoke
prose
instead
of
intoning
doggerel
rhymes
moral
and
physical
exhaustion
was
creeping
over
her
for
the
time
sealing
up
the
sources
of
emotion
yet
she
found
herself
half
smiling
as
laurette
rose
from
her
knees
stella
promise
me
that
you
will
rest
whispered
ted
looking
at
her
worn
white
face
with
keen
then
he
raised
her
hand
to
his
lips
murmuring
his
promises
anew
before
stella
left
the
room
what
the
devil
made
you
read
the
scriptures
in
broad
daylight
on
a
thursday
larry
he
said
when
they
were
alone
that
s
just
like
you
ted
you
have
no
imagination
retorted
laurette
you
know
how
they
read
the
bible
at
fairacre
night
and
day
stella
would
feel
your
promise
was
more
of
course
in
a
case
of
this
kind
all
is
fair
in
love
and
don
t
you
believe
i
am
going
to
funk
my
promise
to
stella
returned
ted
doggedly
then
laurette
sat
by
his
bedside
and
told
the
wonderful
news
which
had
by
this
time
mounted
to
her
head
a
great
success
is
never
so
intoxicating
as
when
it
fairly
dawns
on
the
horizon
while
consummation
is
yet
delayed
for
even
to
the
earthliest
nature
fruition
seldom
fails
to
bring
its
satiety
well
larry
you
ve
kept
tareling
in
hand
better
than
people
expected
said
ted
those
who
knew
him
best
said
he
would
never
stay
in
australia
more
than
a
couple
of
this
little
speech
opened
laurette
s
heart
my
dear
boy
no
one
knows
what
a
struggle
i
ve
had
to
keep
talbot
in
the
narrow
path
of
duty
she
said
solemnly
quite
recently
he
was
on
the
point
of
going
off
with
a
wretched
little
divorced
actress
who
danced
and
sang
as
people
used
to
say
like
an
if
angels
ever
made
such
wicked
eyes
at
the
fathers
of
families
she
sang
viene
ben
mio
fra
questi
piante
ascose
ti
vo
la
fronte
incoronar
di
rose
with
such
brazen
archness
i
have
often
thought
and
i
am
sure
of
it
that
in
decent
theatres
which
after
all
owe
much
of
their
support
to
families
effrontery
of
that
kind
should
be
put
down
with
a
strong
hand
but
however
there
talbot
used
to
sit
beside
me
gloating
on
the
little
shining
in
her
impudent
little
the
very
time
i
shouldn
t
have
known
where
to
turn
for
a
crust
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
the
generosity
of
my
good
dear
old
ted
here
you
needn
t
turn
rusty
ted
you
have
too
much
of
the
john
bull
in
you
in
that
respect
always
trying
to
hide
your
generosity
under
a
rough
outside
but
i
must
finish
about
the
actress
yes
i
knew
everything
was
arranged
and
the
precious
pair
were
to
be
off
to
california
in
a
few
days
of
course
i
would
not
enter
upon
such
particulars
to
anyone
but
my
own
brother
not
but
what
it
was
one
of
the
stories
probably
that
men
grinned
over
in
the
club
well
what
did
i
do
flew
into
a
rage
and
prepared
to
run
away
home
on
my
own
account
or
melted
perpetually
into
tears
nothing
of
the
kind
if
i
had
packed
up
and
gone
off
to
godolphin
house
who
would
have
been
relieved
and
delighted
why
talbot
of
course
and
if
on
the
other
hand
i
had
wept
and
implored
he
wouldn
t
have
come
near
the
place
at
all
as
it
was
i
never
lost
his
confidence
i
was
gay
and
smiling
though
my
heart
might
have
been
in
ruins
suspecting
nothing
never
dreaming
i
had
an
inkling
of
what
was
going
on
talbot
was
so
much
off
his
guard
that
i
gleaned
all
necessary
information
i
knew
the
boat
and
the
hour
it
was
to
sail
that
morning
i
had
a
private
interview
with
our
largest
creditor
a
man
to
whom
we
owed
five
hundred
pounds
and
i
said
to
him
if
you
want
to
make
sure
of
twenty
shillings
in
the
pound
of
this
debt
just
see
that
the
honourable
talbot
tareling
doesn
t
leave
by
the
at
noon
under
the
name
signor
foscari
he
didn
t
said
laurette
nodding
triumphantly
at
her
brother
who
by
this
time
was
listening
with
a
look
of
interest
you
are
more
of
a
nut
than
i
ever
thought
you
were
laurette
he
said
with
a
grim
smile
nut
or
not
i
know
what
i
am
about
and
i
would
like
to
know
where
talbot
would
be
this
day
when
there
is
but
a
step
or
two
between
his
being
a
peer
of
england
and
an
hereditary
legislator
of
great
britain
if
i
didn
t
possess
the
necessary
tact
talk
of
the
prodigal
son
talbot
looked
like
one
that
evening
when
he
came
i
suppose
much
older
i
think
a
man
must
have
very
little
idea
of
fun
when
he
has
such
an
escapade
after
he
has
lost
all
the
hair
off
the
top
of
his
head
and
his
moustache
is
grizzled
i
had
got
a
special
friend
to
get
talbot
out
of
the
hands
of
the
creditor
at
once
and
pay
the
five
hundred
pounds
down
i
had
the
amount
by
me
you
know
out
of
the
money
you
gave
me
talbot
thought
i
knew
nothing
of
the
affair
for
he
intercepted
the
letter
he
had
left
at
the
club
to
be
posted
to
me
the
day
after
he
me
he
would
probably
be
away
a
couple
of
years
as
he
really
could
not
stand
melbourne
society
any
longer
he
kindly
advised
me
to
economize
in
his
absence
at
cannawijera
oh
i
knew
what
was
in
it
i
saw
a
draft
of
the
letter
in
his
a
few
days
before
then
yes
and
he
paid
this
friend
three
hundred
pounds
of
the
debt
which
was
of
course
promptly
handed
to
me
i
had
no
scruple
in
keeping
it
for
it
was
part
of
six
hundred
pounds
i
lent
him
early
in
october
yes
all
this
happened
two
days
before
you
were
married
and
there
was
i
that
evening
prattling
away
about
the
babies
as
innocently
as
howard
boy
himself
and
the
next
government
house
a
specially
cosy
little
affair
for
which
an
invitation
had
come
two
or
three
days
before
how
a
man
could
give
himself
up
to
a
bohemian
career
with
such
an
invitation
staring
him
in
the
face
i
can
not
tell
i
don
t
mention
myself
or
the
dear
children
because
it
would
seem
that
these
are
the
items
which
some
men
part
from
most
easily
at
times
more
especially
when
they
have
been
importuned
for
many
weeks
to
hasten
away
to
have
their
brows
coroneted
with
roses
such
as
they
were
of
course
this
news
will
in
a
manner
help
to
steady
talbot
you
see
his
father
is
and
very
but
don
t
reckon
upon
the
old
chap
giving
up
the
ghost
immediately
laurette
said
her
brother
half
smiling
god
forbid
answered
laurette
devoutly
it
was
one
of
the
edifying
features
of
her
character
in
an
emergency
that
piety
of
the
kind
which
preachers
call
a
bulwark
of
the
state
was
always
at
her
command
then
emboldened
by
ted
s
remorseful
mood
and
by
the
thought
that
at
any
moment
the
summons
might
come
which
would
call
talbot
and
herself
to
take
their
place
among
the
english
nobility
laurette
made
a
full
confession
to
ted
of
all
their
financial
difficulties
it
would
take
an
additional
two
thousand
pounds
to
quite
clear
their
liabilities
in
any
case
they
would
be
leaving
for
england
in
about
nine
months
they
ought
to
have
a
thousand
or
two
in
hand
for
emergencies
the
lillimore
estates
were
in
such
a
state
of
impoverishment
with
so
many
charges
on
them
etc
the
upshot
of
these
confidences
was
that
ted
arranged
to
leave
four
thousand
pounds
to
laurette
s
for
after
all
you
ve
proved
yourself
a
true
friend
to
me
larry
and
though
i
ve
put
my
foot
in
it
so
confoundedly
to
begin
oh
my
dear
boy
as
for
that
it
will
soon
blow
over
a
woman
may
have
principles
and
theories
but
life
is
so
arranged
that
she
soon
sees
how
ridiculous
it
is
to
try
and
act
on
them
and
nothing
in
this
world
nor
that
which
is
to
come
will
as
a
rule
enable
her
to
face
a
ridiculous
position
for
a
whole
thus
laurette
like
an
artist
who
knows
how
and
when
to
strike
the
desired
went
on
her
way
conquering
and
to
conquer
stella
s
involved
passionate
nature
her
lack
of
patience
and
fidelity
to
her
better
self
ted
s
fall
and
remorse
tareling
s
chronic
servitude
to
common
vice
all
under
laurette
s
cunning
fingers
were
touched
into
fairy
music
which
led
her
to
that
career
of
assured
triumph
she
had
long
felt
herself
born
to
achieve
nor
did
she
fail
to
acknowledge
her
obligations
to
a
higher
power
an
unwavering
determination
to
make
the
best
of
life
might
compass
much
but
when
dealings
with
such
capricious
and
obstinate
material
as
a
girl
like
stella
are
brought
to
a
successful
issue
one
is
bound
to
recognise
the
aid
of
that
strain
of
divinity
in
mundane
matters
which
shapes
our
ends
them
as
we
this
strain
of
divinity
was
at
times
rather
obscured
in
the
arrangements
of
a
world
in
which
ready
money
was
an
extremely
precarious
possession
with
many
who
might
be
termed
born
leaders
of
society
but
who
could
fail
to
recognise
the
finger
of
an
overruling
providence
in
the
series
of
events
that
had
brought
laurette
to
her
present
position
the
steamed
away
at
the
appointed
hour
with
a
large
number
of
passengers
among
them
rather
more
than
the
average
mixture
of
classes
who
make
up
the
miscellaneous
crowds
that
are
constantly
to
be
found
going
to
and
fro
on
the
between
australia
and
the
old
world
they
were
all
there
from
the
publican
who
had
made
a
large
fortune
in
a
shanty
at
a
new
to
the
governor
whose
term
of
office
had
expired
and
who
discussed
european
politics
with
an
air
of
lofty
reserve
as
if
sources
of
information
lay
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
denied
to
such
everyday
avenues
as
newspapers
ah
yes
yes
that
is
the
popular
rumour
he
would
murmur
with
an
indulgent
smile
as
though
he
had
a
special
asmodeus
in
his
pay
in
each
european
court
his
lady
too
was
usually
surrounded
by
a
small
coterie
who
hung
on
her
words
with
that
pathetic
docility
which
oftentimes
marks
the
australienne
who
has
much
money
and
little
culture
and
who
in
provincial
simplicity
regards
a
governor
s
wife
as
being
necessarily
an
oracle
of
fashion
and
the
higher
social
ethics
but
there
were
many
on
board
the
who
did
not
join
in
this
form
of
conspicuous
among
these
was
anstey
hobbs
who
formed
what
might
be
termed
a
and
numbered
among
her
adherents
many
of
the
melbourne
people
and
a
young
man
who
was
supposed
to
be
engaged
on
a
weighty
work
on
australia
as
he
had
passed
four
months
in
the
had
lived
only
in
the
cities
and
among
the
wealthy
grocer
order
his
qualifications
for
the
task
may
be
imagined
but
then
what
he
lacked
in
experience
he
made
up
in
theories
even
if
he
had
been
deficient
in
these
his
friend
would
have
jogged
his
imagination
the
omnipotence
of
money
in
our
young
republics
that
is
the
bane
of
our
social
life
fitzalan
she
would
say
sententiously
on
which
fitzalan
would
whip
out
his
and
enter
the
observation
with
a
glow
of
thankfulness
at
being
able
to
gather
knowledge
at
so
sure
and
trustworthy
a
source
look
at
those
exuberant
young
women
sweeping
the
deck
in
plush
and
lace
their
mother
laid
the
foundation
of
the
family
s
immense
wealth
by
washing
in
the
early
days
of
the
ballarat
diggings
and
then
the
father
kept
a
sly
now
their
lives
are
as
much
divorced
from
labour
as
solomon
s
in
her
desire
to
be
epigrammatic
anstey
hobbs
occasionally
perpetrated
a
derangement
of
associations
of
which
this
may
be
taken
as
a
favourable
specimen
they
keep
they
talk
slang
they
wear
pearls
and
diamonds
at
breakfast
and
their
reading
is
confined
to
a
few
trashy
novels
and
sporting
news
their
sole
idea
of
conversation
is
horsy
chaff
and
their
favourite
avocation
is
a
pronounced
flirtation
ah
fitzalan
it
is
a
cruel
fate
to
find
one
s
self
bracketed
with
such
people
yes
people
like
you
may
well
you
have
helped
me
to
a
much
clearer
understanding
of
these
young
ladies
i
fear
when
my
work
come
out
you
will
find
it
enriched
with
many
of
your
observations
they
are
so
true
to
the
life
so
apt
so
full
of
individuality
and
that
young
lady
who
keeps
so
much
aloof
who
has
constantly
a
book
in
her
hands
and
seldom
speaks
except
to
her
husband
or
dog
or
her
maid
and
has
formed
no
friendship
except
with
a
sick
ape
oh
ted
ritchie
well
now
there
is
a
study
for
you
a
few
months
ago
that
languid
supercilious
indifferent
young
person
who
preserves
such
a
haughty
silence
most
of
the
day
was
introduced
for
the
first
time
to
what
might
be
termed
society
she
was
delightfully
naïve
and
fresh
interested
in
everyone
and
one
might
also
say
whole
face
constantly
sparkling
with
enjoyment
she
had
too
a
very
fair
idea
of
talking
perhaps
a
little
too
in
her
delight
in
entering
fashionable
society
too
ready
with
a
smile
when
there
was
no
call
for
it
but
on
the
whole
so
vivacious
and
ingenuous
that
it
was
quite
a
pleasure
to
meet
you
amaze
me
what
can
have
wrought
so
marvellous
a
change
money
fifteen
thousand
a
year
is
the
secret
of
it
all
mark
her
cold
listlessness
the
droop
in
her
mouth
the
disengaged
air
she
is
practising
the
of
the
woman
of
society
to
perfection
oh
yes
her
may
be
countess
of
lillimore
any
day
the
two
influences
and
an
aristocratic
been
too
much
for
her
just
notice
the
maid
brings
her
a
couple
of
books
her
husband
shifts
the
sunshade
his
valet
or
groom
rather
leads
up
her
dog
and
then
for
the
first
time
our
fine
lady
permits
herself
a
feeble
smile
one
might
imagine
it
was
a
marriage
la
instead
of
which
the
young
man
was
the
only
one
she
ever
cared
for
and
she
had
set
her
heart
for
years
on
marrying
him
she
has
accomplished
her
is
the
result
now
judge
whether
i
the
exaggerated
part
that
money
plays
with
fitzalan
was
deeply
impressed
by
all
this
and
more
than
ever
conscious
of
his
great
in
securing
so
skilful
a
coadjutor
as
in
imparting
a
lively
local
colour
to
his
australian
impressions
he
made
what
he
would
have
called
a
study
of
ritchie
after
sketching
the
exuberant
young
women
whose
toilettes
on
board
ship
were
of
so
telling
a
nature
whose
fortunes
were
laid
in
so
dramatic
a
form
he
took
up
his
parable
regarding
another
phase
of
australian
young
lady
who
belongs
socially
to
a
higher
grade
but
who
has
lived
in
straitened
circumstances
till
a
lucky
marriage
has
landed
her
in
affluence
and
wealth
here
the
young
man
warmed
to
his
work
and
with
those
and
cumulative
details
which
are
so
much
more
effective
in
the
tourist
s
hands
than
any
shred
of
the
truth
would
be
beset
as
it
is
with
thorny
points
which
do
not
adapt
themselves
harmoniously
to
neatly
packed
little
theories
he
went
on
to
probe
and
accentuate
as
he
would
term
it
the
difference
of
types
the
young
persons
whose
wealth
made
them
so
frankly
jubilant
in
its
enjoyment
had
after
all
been
born
in
the
lap
of
luxury
with
all
their
loud
costly
inappropriate
costumes
their
silken
trains
dusting
the
decks
of
yet
their
faith
in
the
almighty
dollar
as
the
governing
factor
of
life
was
not
so
sublimely
immovable
as
that
of
the
more
cultured
young
lady
who
had
been
poor
and
was
suddenly
in
touch
through
her
husband
s
family
with
the
proud
exclusive
aristocracy
of
england
then
came
a
fetching
picture
of
the
of
this
young
lady
in
her
father
s
house
where
she
had
unwillingly
drudged
with
the
and
spent
a
large
portion
of
her
leisure
in
making
up
cheap
dresses
that
were
as
faithful
a
reproduction
of
the
last
as
circumstances
would
permit
there
was
even
a
light
and
rapid
inventory
of
the
varnished
with
its
plated
ware
the
imitation
brussels
carpet
the
oleographs
the
large
supply
of
the
novel
of
a
order
which
formed
the
chief
reading
of
the
young
lady
whose
heart
would
beat
with
yearning
envy
at
the
facile
victories
of
fortunate
beings
who
command
the
last
triumphs
of
the
milliner
s
confections
and
the
s
knowing
coiffure
is
built
up
by
the
cunning
fingers
of
a
trained
maid
for
under
an
artless
and
vivacious
appearance
an
inflexible
purpose
lodged
itself
in
this
young
woman
s
breast
she
would
if
possible
be
rich
she
would
cast
aside
the
sordid
trappings
that
bound
her
and
soar
into
the
empyrean
of
those
whose
lives
were
beautified
with
wealth
she
would
become
one
of
the
elect
who
neither
toil
nor
spin
and
all
at
once
this
was
accomplished
now
mark
the
outcome
so
possessed
is
this
young
person
with
her
incredible
change
of
fortune
that
her
whole
nature
is
transformed
she
is
penetrated
to
her
with
a
keen
appreciation
of
her
and
yet
she
hides
her
glowing
satisfaction
under
an
air
of
profound
indifference
etc
so
enamoured
did
the
young
man
become
of
the
sketch
thus
done
from
hot
as
it
were
from
the
inner
reality
of
he
was
never
weary
of
adding
new
touches
was
delighted
the
artist
in
her
as
she
would
have
termed
it
expanded
in
considering
this
masterly
exposition
of
character
he
discovered
that
his
study
absented
herself
from
the
sunday
services
held
on
deck
sitting
apart
in
the
society
of
her
dog
and
the
sick
ape
it
was
then
he
wrote
nor
is
this
assumption
of
haughty
coldness
of
languid
scorn
confined
to
the
ordinary
intercourse
of
life
in
her
determination
to
be
quite
above
the
average
be
abreast
with
the
latest
development
of
advanced
thought
so
despises
even
those
outward
observances
of
religion
that
have
consoled
humanity
through
countless
æons
of
after
admiring
this
phrase
hugely
for
some
days
the
thought
occurred
to
him
that
the
church
of
england
was
after
all
dated
and
he
accordingly
made
an
alteration
this
called
being
rigorously
critical
each
shade
every
in
her
nature
is
subtly
touched
she
murmured
adjusting
her
to
take
a
better
look
at
the
subject
who
afforded
these
masterly
discoveries
and
you
tell
me
that
in
the
weeks
immediately
preceding
her
marriage
the
future
lord
lillimore
was
struck
with
the
parisian
frivolity
she
displayed
said
the
budding
author
cogitating
how
he
might
turn
the
circumstance
into
a
phrase
that
would
swell
the
general
effect
but
enough
of
this
young
man
he
was
by
no
means
the
funniest
example
of
those
australian
tourists
whose
modes
of
authorship
mark
them
as
chosen
morsels
for
the
comic
muse
needless
to
say
that
stella
was
throughout
entirely
oblivious
of
the
speculations
to
which
her
altered
demeanour
gave
rise
the
change
indeed
was
sufficiently
startling
to
attract
the
attention
of
one
who
had
known
her
in
the
recent
past
and
we
must
all
have
perceived
from
time
to
time
how
a
theory
protects
the
average
mind
from
any
perception
of
the
very
arrange
themselves
to
make
the
illusion
more
credible
it
often
happens
that
the
sins
into
which
people
are
betrayed
against
themselves
take
long
long
years
to
find
out
the
seeds
have
surely
been
sown
but
may
it
not
be
that
they
have
died
the
sheaves
of
so
many
autumns
have
been
garnered
and
yet
the
tares
have
not
destroyed
the
harvest
may
it
not
be
a
part
of
the
old
superstition
of
sibyl
and
prophet
that
our
deeds
still
travel
with
noiseless
footfalls
ever
keeping
pace
with
ours
till
the
moment
comes
when
their
shadowy
hands
hold
us
faster
than
adamantine
chains
do
not
believe
it
the
root
of
bitterness
is
there
and
unless
we
are
so
forgotten
of
god
that
others
rather
than
ourselves
must
suffer
for
our
the
pulse
of
life
beats
in
the
germ
when
we
least
look
for
its
resurrection
but
there
are
retributions
which
are
as
the
shadow
of
offences
and
follow
hard
on
them
like
hounds
that
nothing
diverts
from
their
quarry
of
this
kind
was
the
bitter
humiliation
which
fell
on
stella
so
swiftly
after
her
unhappy
marriage
yet
the
depths
of
listless
impassiveness
that
closed
round
her
at
this
time
were
not
more
the
result
of
that
dismal
experience
than
the
reaction
after
those
days
of
strange
when
the
whole
forces
of
her
mind
had
been
directed
to
the
effacing
all
memory
of
what
had
been
the
crowning
joy
of
her
life
the
inward
fever
that
had
preyed
on
her
during
the
previous
weeks
now
had
unrestrained
course
one
of
those
dark
periods
of
despair
and
misanthropical
weariness
to
which
the
speculative
brooding
order
of
mind
is
peculiarly
liable
when
fretted
and
overworn
enfolded
her
for
a
time
like
a
palpable
darkness
that
eager
unwearied
curiosity
as
to
the
play
and
meaning
of
life
which
had
given
her
nature
so
delicately
sensitive
a
texture
so
responsive
a
chord
of
sympathy
had
completely
deserted
her
she
had
been
betrayed
and
the
throes
of
awakening
of
cold
hard
disenchantment
and
disillusion
stifled
all
spiritual
life
at
times
an
intolerable
yearning
came
over
her
for
the
sound
of
a
voice
the
sight
of
a
face
which
could
not
now
be
recalled
by
her
without
a
haunting
sense
of
guilt
and
then
how
often
it
rose
up
before
her
that
picture
cruelly
limned
on
her
brain
of
ritchie
s
senseless
dead
by
the
end
of
the
voyage
which
lasted
nearly
five
weeks
stella
had
recovered
something
of
her
old
elasticity
probably
the
wilful
misanthropy
which
led
her
to
avoid
as
far
as
possible
all
intimacy
with
her
had
with
the
breezes
of
the
sea
in
restoring
her
exhausted
forces
and
expelling
the
fever
that
burned
in
her
veins
a
recurring
weight
on
her
temples
a
heavy
throbbing
that
would
come
back
at
intervals
with
no
assignable
cause
remained
but
otherwise
her
bodily
health
was
restored
the
old
trick
of
laughter
came
back
to
her
with
something
of
the
old
interest
in
the
endless
combinations
of
the
great
human
comedy
but
unfortunately
the
healing
process
had
affected
her
mind
much
less
than
her
body
she
was
harder
less
unselfish
less
inclined
to
scan
her
own
action
in
the
misfortune
of
her
marriage
with
justice
she
had
been
betrayed
into
marrying
a
sot
she
put
it
into
merciless
words
with
a
dull
smouldering
resentment
which
was
directed
more
against
the
infinite
treachery
that
life
as
a
whole
so
often
practises
than
against
any
individual
laurette
she
knew
had
played
the
traitor
but
without
any
clue
to
the
baseness
of
her
motive
the
action
as
that
of
a
sister
who
believed
the
meanness
might
work
out
her
brother
s
redemption
appealed
to
stella
as
one
of
those
vicarious
transgressions
which
rightly
or
wrongly
mankind
has
consented
to
regard
with
more
leniency
than
the
falseness
prompted
by
purely
egoistic
aims
ted
paradoxical
as
it
may
seem
she
scarcely
blamed
at
all
he
himself
had
resented
her
acceptance
of
his
conduct
as
being
beyond
his
control
more
keenly
than
any
reproaches
yet
this
was
the
point
of
view
which
came
back
to
her
with
irresistible
conviction
needless
to
say
it
rendered
any
vivid
feeling
of
indignation
impossible
heredity
and
circumstance
the
two
of
could
resist
their
action
when
the
moral
nature
is
unfortified
by
any
culture
of
the
soul
and
even
making
allowance
for
all
the
complex
influences
that
can
be
brought
to
bear
on
conduct
could
any
human
being
s
action
be
shaped
by
himself
apart
from
external
forces
one
disastrous
result
of
the
knowledge
that
had
so
abruptly
broken
on
stella
in
ritchie
s
fatal
weakness
was
that
she
no
longer
tried
to
banish
anselm
langdale
from
her
thoughts
he
now
appeared
to
her
as
the
mainstay
of
her
better
life
she
clung
to
his
image
as
a
devotee
turns
to
a
relic
in
the
hour
of
need
as
the
lassitude
of
melancholy
and
fever
lessened
the
passion
which
for
a
time
had
been
kept
in
abeyance
returned
and
took
possession
of
her
as
before
his
face
and
the
tones
of
his
voice
haunted
her
night
and
day
she
lived
all
the
hours
of
their
intercourse
over
again
till
at
times
the
longing
only
to
look
at
him
even
from
afar
burned
in
her
heart
like
a
slow
consuming
flame
alas
this
is
not
the
way
one
thinks
of
the
dead
it
was
her
dream
to
sit
looking
across
the
sea
at
dawn
in
the
starlight
and
the
white
moonlight
till
the
waves
were
transformed
into
the
great
inland
plain
of
her
native
country
the
tall
kangaroo
grass
as
it
bent
in
soft
ripples
the
earth
the
distant
lines
of
weeping
myall
fringing
a
watercourse
the
vague
wide
horizons
the
moaning
sough
of
the
wind
as
it
rose
in
sighing
gusts
sweeping
over
unpeopled
wastes
the
muffled
beat
of
the
horses
hoofs
on
the
dense
herbage
langdale
riding
close
beside
her
his
head
bent
to
catch
her
sight
and
sound
came
back
to
her
one
by
one
in
some
strange
way
such
visions
consoled
her
they
became
the
kernel
of
her
inward
life
i
shall
never
see
him
again
but
he
is
my
companion
nothing
can
take
that
from
me
she
reasoned
outwardly
the
old
footing
between
herself
and
ritchie
had
been
resumed
stella
s
whole
nature
and
training
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
forego
the
of
life
in
her
intercourse
with
anyone
unfailing
courtesy
and
kindliness
had
been
the
prevailing
notes
in
her
old
home
she
could
repel
with
signal
success
attempts
at
intimacies
which
did
not
recommend
themselves
to
her
as
tolerable
but
she
could
not
come
in
daily
contact
with
one
without
exercising
something
of
that
charm
and
urbanity
of
manner
which
are
the
birthright
of
a
cultivated
nature
as
for
poor
ted
who
in
his
dumb
way
clung
to
the
pathetic
theory
that
he
was
responsible
for
his
actions
he
endured
agonies
of
contrition
when
he
thought
over
his
unpardonable
offence
for
some
time
he
did
so
constantly
cursing
himself
vehemently
the
while
to
have
conquered
his
deadly
enemy
for
so
long
and
at
the
last
to
fall
egregiously
when
it
most
behoved
him
to
be
a
man
of
all
the
ways
that
had
ever
been
invented
of
being
a
complete
but
it
is
impossible
in
these
pages
to
follow
the
terms
that
the
young
man
applied
to
himself
still
mentally
one
gets
used
to
everything
even
to
having
behaved
worse
than
the
most
pitiable
jackass
of
the
most
varied
adjectival
quality
and
remorse
was
wholly
foreign
to
him
an
immovable
belief
grew
on
him
that
never
again
would
he
permit
himself
to
be
delivered
over
to
the
wiles
of
the
devil
in
such
a
fashion
he
had
a
small
calendar
full
of
racing
memoranda
but
none
of
these
were
of
moment
to
him
compared
to
the
little
crosses
in
red
pencil
with
which
he
marked
the
flights
of
the
days
and
weeks
and
already
stella
belonged
to
him
after
a
fashion
he
watched
over
her
during
the
weeks
of
her
lethargic
prostration
with
touching
devotion
it
was
only
when
he
found
that
his
constant
presence
worried
her
that
he
absented
himself
there
were
several
other
young
australian
squatters
on
board
and
though
most
of
them
drank
a
good
the
mere
sight
and
smell
of
stimulants
at
this
time
made
him
he
was
a
good
deal
in
their
society
he
smoked
with
them
and
lost
and
won
money
at
various
games
of
chance
and
they
daily
discussed
horses
and
wool
and
pastoral
leases
and
all
the
topics
that
were
of
mutual
interest
horses
especially
never
seemed
to
pall
on
these
young
men
the
annals
of
the
melbourne
cup
of
the
derby
and
the
grand
prix
of
jockey
clubs
and
the
careers
of
jockeys
were
at
their
in
an
astounding
way
the
blind
devotion
of
a
certain
order
of
minds
of
the
english
race
to
the
achievements
of
young
horses
is
surely
in
its
way
one
of
the
most
curious
phenomena
of
the
day
nowhere
probably
does
the
craze
reach
a
fuller
development
than
in
australia
where
the
climate
the
universal
love
for
outdoor
amusement
the
tendency
to
gamble
and
the
paramount
importance
of
the
horse
as
a
mode
of
locomotion
are
all
factors
that
intensify
the
interest
taken
in
racing
one
of
these
young
men
aubrey
holland
was
a
melbourne
acquaintance
of
ted
s
and
he
introduced
him
to
stella
finding
he
had
travelled
a
good
deal
in
early
youth
she
one
day
endeavoured
to
glean
what
aspect
of
the
great
centres
of
art
and
civilization
had
most
impressed
him
venice
oh
that
was
a
rum
fellow
hired
a
boat
to
go
about
instead
of
a
cab
had
he
been
in
rome
he
didn
t
think
so
but
t
that
the
place
where
they
raced
a
mob
of
horses
through
one
of
the
streets
oh
yes
he
and
his
father
had
been
there
for
three
weeks
ted
s
artistic
education
was
a
trifle
more
advanced
for
after
a
pause
he
asked
if
that
wasn
t
the
old
village
where
they
dug
up
little
images
with
the
arms
chipped
off
later
when
the
two
were
alone
ted
seeing
stella
smile
asked
what
the
joke
was
how
did
you
know
they
dug
up
little
images
in
rome
she
said
by
way
of
answer
oh
don
t
you
remember
that
little
cupid
you
told
me
about
that
was
in
place
you
don
t
seem
to
cotton
much
to
her
now
stella
i
believe
you
like
this
little
beggar
of
an
ape
and
dustiefoot
better
than
anyone
on
yes
we
understand
each
because
none
of
you
talk
that
is
one
reason
then
dustiefoot
has
a
soul
but
does
not
quite
know
it
jacob
hasn
t
got
to
a
soul
yet
and
i
had
one
but
lost
it
so
that
makes
a
sort
of
a
bond
between
then
it
seems
i
am
the
only
one
of
the
four
of
us
that
has
a
soul
i
can
t
think
how
jacob
will
live
after
he
parts
from
you
shall
i
try
to
buy
him
oh
we
can
not
set
up
a
no
as
it
is
there
s
you
and
stella
began
to
laugh
but
though
ted
was
delighted
at
the
sound
he
had
not
a
notion
what
amused
her
so
he
went
on
with
his
calculation
and
dustiefoot
and
maisie
and
ben
and
all
the
the
stars
were
coming
out
one
by
one
in
the
sky
the
southern
cross
had
now
disappeared
for
they
were
sailing
through
the
mediterranean
within
a
day
s
journey
of
brindisi
but
there
were
new
constellations
to
look
for
as
they
began
to
gleam
softly
in
the
depths
of
the
sky
the
glow
of
the
electric
light
suddenly
encircled
them
ritchie
took
out
his
calendar
and
counted
up
his
red
crosses
stella
was
gazing
through
drooping
lashes
over
the
calm
sea
but
instead
of
the
soft
swell
of
the
waves
against
the
ship
she
heard
the
muffled
of
horses
falling
on
the
thick
sward
of
the
wide
peeloo
plain
xlvii
they
reached
berlin
early
one
november
morning
three
days
after
they
landed
in
italy
it
was
a
cold
bright
day
with
a
thin
insubstantial
sort
of
sunshine
and
keen
gusts
of
wind
laden
with
the
sallow
spoils
of
autumn
wherever
there
was
a
tree
with
leaves
to
shed
this
wind
searched
them
out
and
wrenched
them
off
the
stalks
and
swirled
them
away
the
rusty
red
and
pale
amber
of
the
oak
leaves
the
delicate
wistful
green
and
yellow
of
the
birches
the
deep
orange
of
the
the
citron
of
the
common
kind
the
crimson
tufts
of
the
sycamore
trees
and
the
leaves
of
the
were
to
be
seen
in
the
thiergarten
falling
in
soft
perpetual
showers
they
fluttered
in
the
air
for
a
moment
and
then
swelled
the
banks
of
autumn
foliage
piled
up
against
and
benches
and
those
quiet
nooks
in
the
depths
of
the
wood
which
even
the
wind
did
not
readily
penetrate
the
pension
of
the
baroness
von
eisengau
which
had
been
recommended
to
the
ritchies
by
miss
brendover
was
close
to
the
thiergarten
and
the
large
double
windows
of
the
suite
of
rooms
which
ted
engaged
on
the
second
overlooked
the
park
the
novel
sight
of
a
whole
wood
being
shorn
of
its
leaves
and
left
shivering
nakedly
under
a
pale
cold
sky
caught
stella
s
eye
at
once
here
she
took
her
first
long
walk
since
they
had
left
australian
shores
it
seemed
as
though
her
recovery
had
been
largely
dependent
on
the
sea
and
its
invigorating
breezes
the
day
after
leaving
the
she
felt
the
old
listless
languor
and
mental
miasma
stealthily
creeping
over
her
only
those
who
have
for
a
time
been
victimized
by
that
fell
which
like
a
victorious
army
beleaguers
the
very
citadel
of
life
can
realize
the
feeling
of
helpless
subjection
that
fetters
the
mind
under
such
assaults
but
stella
had
so
far
gained
strength
that
she
struggled
against
the
feeling
and
simulated
an
interest
she
did
not
feel
in
the
variety
and
movement
of
travel
on
returning
to
the
pension
ritchie
who
had
been
out
with
his
groom
to
see
about
hiring
horses
from
the
guldenstern
mews
awaited
her
with
a
telegram
that
had
come
from
his
uncle
in
london
directly
on
landing
at
brindisi
ted
instead
of
writing
a
letter
announcing
his
arrival
and
future
address
had
telegraphed
the
wiring
when
practicable
being
his
favourite
mode
of
correspondence
now
a
message
had
come
from
the
old
man
saying
he
had
not
long
to
live
and
requesting
his
nephew
s
presence
as
soon
as
possible
i
suppose
i
had
better
start
soon
what
do
you
think
stella
oh
go
by
all
means
the
poor
old
man
wants
to
see
you
has
he
any
children
two
i
think
i
wonder
if
hetty
and
jemima
are
like
larry
they
say
cousins
are
often
more
alike
than
sisters
and
you
see
my
aunt
is
my
mother
s
sister
she
s
a
good
deal
older
than
my
mother
and
rather
gone
in
the
upper
story
when
she
writes
she
always
asks
the
same
questions
the
last
letter
i
saw
of
hers
she
asked
if
i
was
still
in
college
you
see
the
governor
told
her
he
had
sent
me
there
and
it
wasn
t
the
habit
in
the
families
in
england
to
send
the
boys
to
college
so
it
stuck
in
the
old
lady
s
is
dear
ted
in
college
still
says
she
with
a
heavy
stroke
under
college
why
do
some
women
always
put
strokes
in
their
letters
i
used
to
get
letters
ted
suddenly
paused
as
if
struck
with
the
thought
that
there
are
some
reminiscences
better
left
in
oblivion
well
go
on
ted
said
stella
with
something
of
the
old
sense
of
fun
struggling
to
the
surface
was
it
the
adjectives
that
were
always
underlined
what
are
adjectives
oh
the
words
that
were
put
before
your
name
in
the
letters
you
used
to
get
once
my
dearly
beloved
edward
they
adjectives
oh
the
beloved
a
serious
affair
well
i
don
t
believe
you
care
a
snuff
did
you
never
feel
a
bit
jealous
of
anyone
stella
except
that
time
when
cuth
got
engaged
well
i
don
t
half
like
going
without
you
the
old
aunt
will
believe
i
ve
left
college
at
last
but
she
ll
never
believe
i
m
married
when
she
doesn
t
see
you
and
are
you
really
married
dear
she
ll
say
every
time
i
see
her
and
the
expect
they
re
like
in
what
way
well
like
harking
back
on
any
point
you
don
t
fully
explain
but
why
didn
t
stella
come
that
s
the
way
larry
would
keep
nagging
away
till
you
either
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
or
if
that
wasn
t
to
be
done
cleared
out
of
her
way
i
ll
tell
them
straight
out
from
the
beginning
you
cried
your
eyes
out
to
come
but
i
wouldn
t
let
you
because
of
the
fogs
of
course
laurette
could
well
fancy
a
man
and
his
wife
might
part
soon
after
the
honeymoon
without
elderly
maiden
ladies
will
find
it
hard
to
believe
by
the
way
stella
how
long
is
the
honeymoon
supposed
to
last
you
re
not
an
authority
lord
i
wish
i
were
well
if
they
don
t
suck
in
the
first
yarn
i
ll
let
them
believe
i
wanted
to
have
a
bit
of
a
shine
all
by
myself
that
ll
make
the
old
tabbies
sit
of
course
being
an
australian
they
ll
take
in
anything
about
me
so
they
may
when
all
is
told
but
isn
t
it
rather
queer
stella
how
a
fellow
would
sooner
any
hanged
yarn
be
taken
in
about
him
than
the
truth
it
s
not
only
with
myself
but
i
ve
noticed
it
over
and
over
again
i
had
a
fellow
once
who
had
been
in
quod
for
some
months
it
got
to
be
known
and
he
pretended
it
was
for
putting
a
knife
in
a
it
was
for
prigging
yes
but
the
truth
is
generally
even
more
damaging
than
the
hanged
yarn
you
see
i
suppose
the
bookkeeper
was
one
of
the
per
cent
of
the
educated
who
go
under
and
he
would
be
sooner
supposed
to
stab
a
man
than
steal
from
yes
stella
you
re
right
as
long
as
people
feel
they
could
be
different
they
re
ashamed
of
themselves
but
if
they
got
to
think
they
couldn
t
help
it
a
little
bit
and
it
was
all
because
it
was
to
be
somehow
look
here
stella
you
ve
been
awfully
good
i
know
over
this
confounded
business
but
i
wish
to
god
you
had
given
me
a
rowing
or
would
speak
to
me
now
and
then
about
if
you
were
afraid
don
t
you
know
that
i
wouldn
t
keep
straight
you
are
frightfully
cut
up
in
one
way
and
yet
in
another
sometimes
it
comes
over
me
that
you
fret
because
you
married
because
was
such
an
awful
love
even
when
it
has
failed
to
be
the
saving
influence
of
a
man
s
life
has
a
curious
power
of
purging
the
heavy
eye
the
aspect
of
the
matter
put
into
such
plain
terms
by
ritchie
was
so
near
the
truth
that
stella
was
for
a
moment
what
is
the
use
of
talking
about
it
she
said
lying
back
in
the
wide
padded
armchair
with
eyes
i
am
a
muff
to
bring
it
up
i
know
but
stella
when
i
look
at
you
sometimes
i
feel
as
if
i
could
not
bear
it
always
before
this
you
walked
as
if
you
were
treading
on
eyes
dancing
it
didn
t
matter
whether
the
sun
were
shining
or
not
it
came
in
with
you
and
now
you
sit
by
the
hour
as
if
you
saw
nothing
you
do
not
even
read
i
sometimes
think
if
you
would
lie
up
properly
till
your
illness
is
over
it
would
be
you
must
have
some
sort
of
fever
hanging
about
you
you
eat
next
to
nothing
and
in
the
morning
you
look
more
tired
than
when
you
went
to
leave
it
to
time
ted
she
said
gently
stroking
his
brown
strong
hand
lightly
with
her
slender
fingers
which
had
now
a
transparent
aspect
she
wore
no
rings
except
her
and
it
hung
so
loose
that
once
or
twice
it
had
dropped
off
xlviii
ritchie
left
for
england
on
the
following
day
and
almost
to
her
own
surprise
stella
found
that
his
absence
made
a
blank
she
had
not
realized
till
he
was
gone
how
his
unfailing
thoughtfulness
led
him
to
anticipate
every
wish
how
his
unceasing
attentions
folded
her
round
on
every
side
at
any
time
he
disliked
fuss
or
demonstration
so
much
that
he
would
sooner
do
deeds
of
kindness
or
generosity
like
a
thief
in
the
night
so
as
to
avoid
being
thanked
but
much
more
was
this
the
case
when
stella
s
large
melancholy
eyes
and
long
impassive
reveries
touched
him
daily
with
a
fresh
apprehension
of
the
heinousness
of
his
past
conduct
she
had
been
learning
to
love
him
he
thought
to
himself
when
suddenly
on
that
fatal
night
she
saw
him
sunk
below
the
level
of
the
the
phrase
had
remained
in
his
mind
and
he
pondered
over
it
till
its
full
meaning
lay
revealed
the
dog
that
sleeps
at
your
door
may
be
stabbed
or
poisoned
but
no
form
of
indulgence
will
steal
his
senses
from
him
so
that
his
master
may
be
robbed
or
murdered
without
a
bark
to
warn
him
of
his
danger
the
horse
in
your
stable
does
not
himself
so
that
he
can
not
serve
you
with
his
docility
and
speed
he
understood
what
stella
meant
when
on
the
journey
from
italy
she
said
in
connection
with
some
altercation
that
had
taken
place
with
officials
regarding
dustiefoot
it
is
a
superstition
with
me
not
to
say
the
lower
animals
i
never
hear
the
phrase
without
thinking
of
myriads
of
human
lives
compared
to
which
the
existence
of
a
toad
is
a
high
and
holy
he
thought
over
the
matter
till
a
curious
impetus
was
given
to
his
imagination
he
imagined
stella
in
some
extremity
crying
aloud
to
him
for
help
on
that
night
at
monico
him
to
her
aid
no
he
could
not
hear
her
he
could
not
be
roused
he
was
beyond
the
reach
of
all
human
appeal
always
when
he
came
to
that
point
he
indulged
in
very
strong
language
against
himself
but
his
emotion
did
not
end
there
he
became
skilful
in
devising
ways
of
serving
stella
and
withal
she
knew
of
old
how
he
hated
to
be
thanked
and
that
was
an
added
relief
the
good
people
who
do
so
much
for
us
and
then
wait
hat
in
hand
for
a
speech
of
grateful
recognition
get
hardly
used
in
the
end
we
learn
to
avoid
them
in
the
day
of
calamity
far
more
rigorously
than
those
who
wilfully
throw
at
us
ted
would
even
have
gone
to
all
wagner
s
operas
with
stella
though
lohengrin
to
which
he
accompanied
her
on
the
first
night
they
were
in
berlin
seemed
to
him
devised
to
keep
people
beyond
hearing
of
course
he
admitted
you
are
glad
when
the
soft
parts
come
but
i
would
feel
so
much
jollier
not
to
hear
any
and
then
stella
to
tie
a
string
to
the
leg
of
a
pigeon
and
pretend
it
is
the
holy
ghost
do
you
think
your
mother
would
like
it
stella
smiled
repeatedly
at
the
inquiry
ted
s
direct
habit
of
putting
things
as
they
appeared
to
him
into
plain
phrase
never
forsook
him
after
all
i
think
i
should
enjoy
these
operas
more
with
you
ted
she
said
as
they
were
together
the
preceding
his
departure
ted
flushed
deeply
but
did
not
trust
himself
to
reply
whatever
you
do
stella
he
said
after
a
pause
don
t
you
go
too
much
into
the
houses
of
sick
people
to
catch
fever
and
things
that
schulz
you
went
to
see
it
anything
catching
no
ted
it
is
just
poverty
and
having
her
husband
imprisoned
for
posting
up
announcements
of
a
socialistic
meeting
besides
i
am
not
a
favourite
of
the
gods
i
am
one
of
the
workaday
masses
who
gather
up
all
the
arrows
on
their
targets
and
still
live
on
and
then
you
know
one
can
die
only
but
moses
what
a
jolly
difference
it
makes
whether
one
dies
before
or
after
eighty
don
t
you
go
and
slip
me
up
with
any
sell
of
that
kind
whatever
you
do
we
are
going
to
keep
our
golden
one
of
these
years
across
the
blue
alsatian
mountains
do
you
remember
how
billy
stein
used
to
sing
that
making
his
voice
shiver
like
a
jelly
yes
she
missed
him
hourly
and
in
his
absence
she
made
faint
efforts
to
look
towards
the
future
without
quailing
it
was
true
that
even
under
happier
circumstances
there
could
be
none
of
that
delicate
mental
companionship
which
springs
from
the
mutual
insight
of
affinity
none
of
that
spontaneous
interchange
of
thought
of
tender
imaginative
fancies
which
are
the
aerial
rootlets
of
the
mind
and
make
the
perennial
charm
of
close
intimacy
but
life
is
on
the
whole
a
rough
and
ready
arrangement
essentially
founded
on
and
reinforced
by
exterior
realities
which
make
a
wider
claim
on
our
nature
than
we
are
always
willing
to
allow
and
after
all
the
young
human
heart
does
not
doat
on
being
a
bleeding
it
is
given
rather
to
that
homely
habit
known
as
making
the
best
of
things
of
finding
warmth
in
the
fire
after
the
great
storms
of
life
have
wrecked
the
gallant
barks
that
set
out
laden
with
the
fond
dreams
of
youth
with
stella
it
is
certain
that
her
profound
capacity
of
suffering
and
her
deep
tinge
of
constitutional
melancholy
were
closely
related
to
that
large
generosity
of
nature
which
is
rooted
in
the
love
of
life
her
wide
sympathies
vivid
insight
and
keen
interest
in
the
manifold
aspects
of
the
human
comedy
could
not
long
lie
dormant
when
the
bitter
languor
which
had
for
a
time
overwhelmed
her
began
slowly
to
be
dissipated
she
made
no
rapid
strides
in
recovery
both
sleep
and
appetite
were
errant
and
fitful
in
the
week
that
followed
ritchie
s
departure
it
often
occurred
to
her
that
there
was
wisdom
in
his
advice
that
she
should
for
a
little
time
keep
to
her
bed
in
the
hope
of
getting
rid
of
that
haunting
nameless
malaise
which
at
her
best
seemed
never
far
off
yet
the
worst
seemed
to
be
over
those
haunting
visions
of
the
night
in
which
she
saw
langdale
as
vividly
as
in
life
in
which
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
the
touch
of
his
hand
thrilled
her
with
overmastering
reality
became
gradually
less
frequent
less
absorbing
and
this
on
the
whole
reassured
her
it
enabled
her
to
begin
to
look
on
the
past
as
inevitable
and
that
had
gone
for
ever
from
far
as
that
can
be
the
case
with
any
epoch
which
for
good
or
evil
has
left
the
deepest
imprint
on
the
heart
but
one
vision
sleeping
and
waking
eluded
all
effort
at
dislodgment
solemn
silent
unpeopled
in
the
delicate
rose
boundary
of
earth
and
sky
lost
in
limitless
a
few
great
white
stars
swimming
into
the
tender
amethyst
of
the
sky
two
riding
side
by
side
without
a
single
circumscribing
line
to
meet
their
eyes
in
the
vast
immensity
that
lay
around
them
it
was
a
picture
that
night
and
day
would
rise
up
before
her
with
incredible
intensity
of
out
for
the
moment
all
other
sights
gradually
she
came
to
regard
it
as
one
of
those
consecrated
ideal
passages
of
life
which
like
the
rapture
evoked
by
high
imaginative
poetry
mercifully
steeps
the
mind
in
forgetfulness
of
the
bald
dreary
stretches
of
existence
that
threaten
at
times
to
paralyze
action
and
even
thought
itself
that
happy
girl
with
low
fond
laughter
bubbling
to
her
lips
as
lightly
as
carols
float
from
the
throat
of
a
bird
was
she
not
as
remote
from
stella
s
actual
self
as
a
scene
in
an
old
romance
let
them
ride
on
in
the
wistful
light
that
clothes
the
great
australian
two
whose
happiness
seemed
so
inviolable
a
possession
let
their
hearts
beat
at
the
sound
of
each
other
s
voice
as
to
the
cadence
of
subtle
music
they
have
passed
beyond
the
inexorable
law
of
change
they
belong
to
a
realm
invulnerable
to
the
tooth
of
time
where
neither
moth
nor
rust
doth
corrupt
here
in
the
common
life
with
which
we
have
to
do
love
and
sorrow
alike
are
blunted
by
the
deadening
march
of
successive
days
in
place
of
vivid
emotion
there
falls
a
coldness
as
on
the
altar
of
a
buried
temple
oh
life
life
is
this
the
kernel
of
thy
happiness
for
so
many
anguished
memories
of
hopes
that
fell
like
grass
before
the
scythe
of
the
mower
thus
would
the
sorrowful
girl
commune
with
herself
and
yet
day
by
day
the
discipline
of
pain
began
to
direct
her
thoughts
into
other
channels
the
interest
which
the
first
spectacle
of
life
in
berlin
had
awakened
grew
deeper
as
she
saw
more
of
the
struggle
for
existence
around
her
more
especially
among
the
very
poor
she
formed
new
acquaintances
daily
poor
children
old
men
dragging
burdens
beyond
their
strength
old
women
sweeping
up
leaves
on
the
paths
of
the
thiergarten
the
halt
and
the
maimed
at
street
stalls
with
pitiful
little
objects
of
were
all
ready
in
their
intervals
of
rest
to
respond
with
quick
cordiality
to
her
first
timid
overtures
of
acquaintanceship
the
grief
that
nestled
close
at
her
own
heart
quickened
her
observation
into
an
interpretative
faculty
her
mind
became
sensitive
to
the
myriad
forms
of
unhappiness
around
her
as
waters
are
to
the
movement
of
clouds
she
was
during
these
first
days
in
berlin
continually
on
the
alert
to
observe
to
sympathize
and
to
help
and
with
this
came
something
of
that
renovation
of
spirit
which
comes
with
work
and
interests
that
lead
the
mind
away
from
its
own
sorrows
and
ailments
ted
wrote
frequently
his
uncle
had
rallied
a
little
but
the
end
could
not
be
far
off
it
seemed
he
had
various
reasons
for
wishing
his
nephew
s
presence
he
is
a
great
deal
richer
than
we
any
of
us
knew
and
he
fancies
he
owes
a
good
deal
to
the
six
thousand
pounds
i
sent
when
my
uncle
christopher
died
and
left
me
strathhaye
you
know
the
two
quarrelled
so
when
they
were
young
men
that
they
never
spoke
or
wrote
to
each
other
for
years
i
did
hear
something
about
the
reason
that
both
were
in
love
with
aunt
polly
lord
how
stupid
men
would
feel
for
quarrelling
about
a
woman
if
they
could
see
her
years
afterwards
the
avenells
are
here
just
now
i
go
a
good
deal
with
them
to
the
theatres
etc
i
have
been
twice
to
see
the
lillimores
they
came
to
town
lately
and
are
as
kind
as
they
can
be
lady
lillimore
is
very
anxious
to
know
you
talbot
she
says
has
told
her
about
you
she
is
one
of
the
kindest
old
like
your
mother
i
suppose
it
s
the
old
man
talbot
took
after
not
that
a
fellow
need
take
after
anyone
but
himself
to
turn
out
pretty
crooked
but
tareling
seems
at
one
time
or
other
to
have
got
into
every
possible
sort
of
work
i
suppose
he
d
think
that
the
biggest
misfortune
of
all
certainly
larry
got
a
pig
in
a
poke
when
she
married
him
but
i
expect
when
she
s
ladyshipped
all
day
long
and
has
a
string
of
flunkeys
to
look
on
when
she
eats
her
dinner
she
ll
be
quite
pleased
with
herself
why
don
t
you
write
longer
letters
i
would
like
to
get
one
every
day
you
make
them
just
like
talking
hetty
and
jemima
send
their
love
they
swallowed
the
yarn
about
your
crying
to
come
with
me
and
they
think
if
i
have
to
stay
much
longer
you
ll
come
after
me
will
you
ever
want
to
stella
the
thought
of
it
makes
me
go
queer
all
over
it
s
a
week
yesterday
since
i
it
seems
more
like
a
month
the
is
very
kind
i
met
several
americans
at
his
house
the
other
evening
i
tell
you
what
feel
quite
green
with
jealousy
when
i
meet
americans
we
must
have
a
country
of
our
own
governed
by
ourselves
and
not
have
the
name
of
being
ruled
by
fellows
sent
out
of
the
heart
of
london
to
do
no
good
but
set
people
by
the
ears
with
their
penny
government
house
cliques
in
england
unless
people
know
something
of
racing
they
have
a
notion
that
australia
is
a
poky
island
full
of
mosquitoes
and
a
few
niggers
colonies
they
say
as
if
we
were
bad
figs
they
bought
at
fourpence
a
box
i
hope
that
gave
me
the
about
living
to
be
if
only
to
live
to
see
australia
a
properly
independent
country
i
went
to
westminster
abbey
the
other
day
but
it
s
so
full
of
graven
images
i
couldn
t
see
a
mortal
this
letter
reached
stella
as
she
was
about
to
set
out
to
pay
two
visits
the
first
was
to
schulz
the
next
to
professor
kellwitz
the
berlin
savant
she
had
seen
at
stein
s
early
in
the
year
they
met
in
the
thiergarten
two
days
previously
much
to
the
professor
s
delight
he
had
just
received
a
letter
from
his
adelaide
friends
in
which
mention
was
made
of
stella
s
marriage
he
had
to
admit
a
similar
indiscretion
on
his
own
part
but
his
wife
was
just
then
in
dresden
having
been
summoned
there
on
account
of
the
dangerous
illness
of
a
married
daughter
do
not
wait
till
she
returns
before
coming
in
a
neighbourly
way
to
look
over
my
books
and
carry
away
any
you
want
to
read
urged
the
professor
come
on
wednesday
and
i
shall
then
be
able
to
show
you
the
last
volume
published
on
comparative
ethnology
by
an
old
university
comrade
of
stein
s
this
is
the
number
of
our
house
your
pension
is
within
ten
minutes
walk
of
this
was
wednesday
and
stella
accordingly
made
the
visit
the
professor
had
been
unexpectedly
called
out
that
afternoon
but
left
a
message
to
say
he
hoped
to
be
back
before
ritchie
left
she
was
shown
into
the
library
and
study
where
on
the
centre
of
the
pedestal
table
in
its
paper
binding
and
uncut
leaves
fresh
from
the
printer
s
lay
the
last
profound
contribution
to
ethnological
science
the
library
was
a
large
apartment
overlooking
the
thiergarten
and
lined
with
books
from
floor
to
ceiling
on
all
sides
except
one
which
was
covered
with
engravings
and
photographs
a
large
proportion
being
reproductions
of
the
most
ancient
and
primitive
human
dwellings
of
which
any
record
or
traces
have
been
discovered
on
top
of
the
bookshelves
were
ranged
busts
of
the
immortals
there
were
tables
piled
high
with
books
others
with
magazines
and
pamphlets
and
even
the
chairs
were
not
in
all
cases
kept
free
but
close
to
the
centre
pedestal
table
there
was
a
deep
couch
to
which
a
long
placid
career
had
given
a
specially
alluring
aspect
stella
took
possession
of
it
and
looked
round
the
room
with
that
quick
response
to
the
mere
presence
of
books
instinctive
to
those
who
love
them
no
doubt
there
are
countless
theories
and
systems
reposing
in
some
of
these
tomes
to
which
time
has
brought
utter
ruin
she
thought
but
all
the
great
are
men
whose
thoughts
wander
through
eternity
and
pierce
windows
in
the
souls
of
successive
generations
how
even
to
think
of
them
seems
to
woo
one
into
a
sanctuary
where
the
vehement
emotions
and
storms
of
life
are
left
behind
like
a
conquered
fortress
invested
with
a
force
which
keeps
the
old
rebels
in
subjection
the
air
of
the
room
so
suggestive
of
detachment
from
the
ebb
and
flow
of
obdurate
tides
of
passionate
regret
of
revolt
and
grief
of
apathetic
indifference
appealed
to
her
and
seemed
to
carry
a
message
of
consolation
of
peace
she
tried
to
believe
that
the
of
passion
had
loosened
its
hold
on
her
after
all
life
was
not
a
tale
to
be
cast
aside
when
it
does
not
fulfil
its
early
promises
of
a
harp
that
is
worthless
because
one
string
is
silenced
the
work
of
the
world
is
carried
on
mostly
by
disillusioned
men
and
women
yes
and
by
those
who
throw
the
whole
strength
of
their
lives
into
action
for
the
common
weal
she
took
up
the
ethnological
work
and
turned
over
its
pages
curiously
but
when
she
tried
to
read
the
words
swam
before
her
and
her
temples
throbbed
heavily
this
was
not
a
new
experience
for
so
much
of
the
invalid
still
clung
to
her
that
any
prolonged
exertion
induced
a
creeping
exhaustion
which
made
thought
and
action
alike
difficult
she
leant
back
on
the
wide
yielding
couch
saying
to
herself
she
would
rest
a
little
and
then
read
in
a
few
moments
she
was
fast
asleep
xlix
she
seemed
to
have
slept
but
a
few
moments
when
a
dream
of
extraordinary
vividness
took
entire
possession
of
her
langdale
was
quito
near
her
he
had
suddenly
entered
the
room
stella
stella
my
beloved
he
murmured
in
a
hushed
voice
looking
at
her
she
would
not
move
lest
she
would
waken
it
was
long
since
she
had
seen
anselm
so
clearly
and
now
when
she
saw
him
she
knew
that
she
had
been
famishing
for
a
sight
of
his
face
and
how
close
and
real
his
voice
sounded
with
its
deep
tender
intonations
he
trod
gently
so
as
not
to
waken
her
he
stood
over
her
his
hand
resting
on
the
back
of
the
couch
her
heart
began
to
beat
wildly
ah
would
that
she
might
never
waken
from
this
vision
it
was
so
much
part
of
herself
it
throbbed
in
every
vein
of
her
body
why
had
she
struggled
against
this
communion
as
if
it
were
an
evil
infatuation
it
was
the
saving
element
left
to
steady
reason
in
the
wreck
that
had
overtaken
her
she
knew
his
face
was
near
hers
she
heard
herself
repeating
his
name
once
and
again
and
then
his
arms
were
round
breath
came
in
quick
pants
as
he
held
her
to
him
she
would
not
open
her
eyes
lest
this
dream
should
dissolve
dream
could
this
be
a
dream
could
imagination
aided
by
all
the
ingenuity
of
sleep
feign
the
ecstasy
of
the
kisses
softly
imprinted
on
her
face
darling
you
called
me
are
you
still
asleep
in
this
bewildering
dream
which
copied
life
with
invincible
fidelity
she
seemed
to
open
her
lo
there
he
was
close
beside
her
his
face
irradiated
with
joy
oh
anselm
let
me
sleep
on
she
said
faintly
and
the
dream
went
on
for
he
sat
beside
her
and
drew
her
close
to
him
so
that
her
weary
head
lay
upon
his
breast
and
so
she
remained
for
a
little
with
closed
eyes
but
at
last
she
began
to
gather
up
proofs
of
being
awake
she
heard
the
ticking
of
a
timepiece
the
sound
of
a
military
band
the
muffled
roll
of
carriages
then
timidly
she
touched
the
hands
that
clasped
her
in
so
strong
and
unrelaxing
a
way
dear
little
australian
dormouse
does
this
heavy
atmosphere
make
you
so
drowsy
he
said
with
a
happy
laugh
it
was
no
dream
she
gave
a
low
cry
of
joy
and
threw
her
arms
around
him
for
a
few
bewildered
moments
a
merciful
oblivion
overtook
her
all
the
misery
and
humiliation
and
endless
moral
conflict
of
the
past
weeks
were
swept
from
her
how
is
one
to
account
for
the
convictions
that
suddenly
lodge
in
the
heart
without
a
spoken
word
the
first
collected
thought
which
came
to
stella
was
that
the
dream
she
dreamt
on
the
morning
of
her
was
true
no
woman
stood
between
her
and
shadow
on
his
past
life
divided
them
she
knew
it
well
as
he
drew
her
close
against
his
heart
murmuring
incoherent
endearments
and
feasting
his
eyes
on
her
face
it
was
much
paler
than
formerly
and
surely
it
was
worn
with
dark
circles
round
the
large
eyes
more
wistful
and
than
ever
and
those
drawn
lines
round
the
mouth
she
must
have
suffered
much
since
they
parted
the
thought
sobered
the
transports
of
his
joy
has
my
sweet
herzblättchen
been
ill
oh
anselm
anselm
was
all
she
could
say
and
then
she
screened
her
face
from
his
sight
hiding
it
against
his
breast
all
that
had
happened
since
they
parted
in
the
light
of
the
mystical
rose
twilight
that
stole
in
through
the
tangled
clusters
of
leaves
and
purple
and
scarlet
enclosing
the
wide
veranda
of
the
peaceful
home
on
the
borders
of
the
great
australian
plain
had
for
a
few
tumultuous
moments
been
whirled
from
her
consciousness
and
now
that
the
reality
like
a
hideous
nightmare
began
once
more
to
reassert
itself
she
struggled
to
keep
it
at
bay
so
you
came
after
all
as
you
threatened
you
would
and
we
have
found
each
other
once
more
he
said
stroking
her
hair
fondly
she
did
not
look
up
but
drew
a
long
low
shuddering
sigh
like
a
child
which
has
been
wearied
with
wandering
but
is
once
more
safe
in
its
mother
s
arms
yes
stella
we
have
found
each
other
this
time
never
to
lose
one
another
till
death
us
do
part
oh
merciful
heaven
how
the
phantom
of
her
wrecked
life
began
to
rise
and
float
before
her
vivid
and
pitiful
as
the
form
of
a
broken
ship
that
comes
with
shattered
masts
and
dragging
anchors
to
a
wild
waste
island
in
which
never
a
creature
of
god
has
lodged
and
found
shelter
you
got
my
letter
all
safe
liebe
was
it
a
great
shock
to
you
that
enclosure
telling
the
cause
of
my
visit
to
england
a
shudder
passed
over
her
and
she
moaned
a
little
but
made
no
reply
then
the
reflection
dawned
on
him
that
in
truth
the
news
had
wounded
her
cruelly
coming
so
unexpectedly
in
the
midst
of
her
great
happiness
her
face
as
he
had
last
seen
large
radiant
eyes
now
thrilling
him
with
their
steady
gaze
then
softly
veiled
with
their
long
dark
lashes
the
warm
tender
damask
in
her
voice
like
a
hidden
bird
that
sang
had
been
with
him
through
the
weary
weeks
of
separation
like
a
vision
of
gladness
untroubled
by
one
pang
of
doubt
only
in
the
past
week
or
two
when
no
letters
reached
him
he
had
been
tormented
with
fears
lest
she
had
fallen
had
this
after
all
been
the
case
she
was
so
wan
and
unlike
the
picture
that
had
been
with
him
day
and
night
the
smiles
that
rose
in
her
eyes
and
lingered
in
them
while
her
face
was
grave
her
low
glad
peals
of
laughter
her
quick
imperious
gestures
her
troops
of
fancies
blithe
and
suggestive
as
the
carols
of
birds
in
spring
what
had
become
of
all
these
but
he
reminded
himself
that
under
all
the
gaiety
and
quick
ardour
of
her
nature
there
had
ever
been
a
strong
of
almost
sombre
melancholy
in
their
separation
this
had
evidently
gained
the
upper
hand
her
face
would
soon
resume
its
old
fascinating
almost
hard
one
would
say
at
times
then
soft
and
tender
like
a
pearled
with
dew
and
softly
stirred
by
the
morning
air
in
the
rush
of
his
sudden
joy
on
seeing
her
fast
asleep
in
his
stepfather
s
house
langdale
had
scarcely
wondered
at
stella
s
unexpected
presence
in
the
old
world
those
who
have
been
in
australia
know
that
people
of
means
there
may
at
any
moment
embark
on
a
voyage
to
the
old
that
vast
so
remote
from
all
the
great
international
centres
of
activity
is
yet
in
such
curiously
close
touch
with
all
the
far
ends
of
the
earth
one
of
the
last
things
stella
had
said
to
him
at
parting
was
you
know
anselm
if
you
are
detained
in
england
just
say
hey
presto
one
morning
and
there
i
shall
be
at
your
door
with
a
wreath
of
in
my
hair
all
ready
to
go
to
church
oh
there
are
scores
of
people
with
whom
i
could
to
begin
had
she
perhaps
fallen
ill
and
set
out
with
her
sister
or
some
friend
directly
after
getting
his
mauritius
letter
in
which
he
told
her
of
his
mother
s
second
marriage
and
asked
her
to
address
his
letters
after
the
beginning
of
november
to
no
thiergarten
strasse
or
was
she
one
of
the
adelaide
friends
of
whom
the
professor
spoke
so
warmly
but
it
mattered
not
how
she
had
come
here
she
was
and
soon
she
would
be
her
old
joyous
self
again
she
had
somehow
suffered
keenly
but
the
reaction
would
soon
set
in
he
would
not
worry
her
with
questions
or
exclamations
over
her
altered
looks
she
had
looked
so
much
more
like
her
old
self
when
she
had
been
asleep
with
a
soft
flush
mantling
in
her
cheeks
the
moment
i
got
your
precious
letter
i
felt
i
must
tell
you
all
before
i
went
away
darling
he
said
in
a
low
soothing
voice
your
beloved
letter
which
i
have
read
till
it
is
almost
worn
out
and
this
great
lovely
lock
of
your
have
kissed
it
night
and
he
had
taken
the
letter
out
of
his
and
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
pages
and
the
coiled
lock
of
her
hair
the
thought
of
all
that
lay
between
them
and
that
happy
night
on
which
she
had
written
with
gleeful
rapture
her
first
made
her
suddenly
turn
faint
and
chill
he
saw
this
and
drawing
her
nearer
to
him
once
more
he
said
now
we
need
only
speak
of
our
our
happiness
without
one
cloud
lingering
from
the
past
it
was
as
the
lawyer
said
a
false
signature
she
died
a
few
months
after
i
left
he
felt
her
trembling
and
he
stroked
her
face
calling
her
by
all
the
old
fond
names
let
me
take
off
your
bonnet
blättchen
and
your
gloves
i
want
to
see
and
feel
your
hands
in
she
hurriedly
removed
her
gloves
intentionally
slipping
off
the
fatal
and
leaving
it
in
the
glove
finger
she
dared
not
let
the
truth
come
upon
him
so
abruptly
she
must
somehow
tell
in
what
words
after
all
dante
showed
some
inflexibility
of
imagination
in
depicting
the
tortures
of
the
damned
life
furnishes
many
more
terrible
situations
than
those
depicted
in
the
circles
of
the
inferno
i
will
tell
you
all
there
is
to
tell
stella
and
then
we
need
not
return
to
this
i
went
from
london
direct
to
brussels
and
found
the
woman
who
had
forged
the
signature
she
admitted
the
imposition
and
i
have
the
needful
vouchers
in
my
possession
she
was
poor
and
i
knew
what
would
have
provided
for
her
oh
yes
you
came
and
bade
me
do
so
did
you
know
that
you
were
with
me
all
the
time
your
precious
little
soul
came
fluttering
with
me
all
the
every
word
he
spoke
fell
on
her
now
like
knotted
thongs
but
she
still
clung
to
him
half
hiding
her
face
from
his
while
the
deep
regular
beating
of
his
heart
seemed
to
her
to
measure
the
moments
that
lay
between
her
and
eternal
death
now
speak
to
me
a
little
my
darling
do
you
know
i
feel
as
if
you
would
vanish
out
of
my
sight
your
presence
is
so
incredible
and
i
was
almost
frantic
because
no
letter
i
can
not
speak
just
now
my
beloved
you
have
suffered
cruelly
then
i
will
speak
till
the
dear
old
gaiety
and
laughter
come
back
let
me
look
into
your
face
geliebte
you
have
been
ill
i
dreamt
you
and
over
again
the
same
dream
always
i
wanted
to
come
to
you
and
always
there
was
some
terrible
obstacle
in
the
way
i
used
to
set
out
and
suddenly
find
myself
wandering
in
unknown
places
with
thick
darkness
falling
and
then
there
would
be
great
cataracts
tumbling
over
in
my
path
when
i
woke
up
i
used
to
try
and
laugh
at
myself
but
i
was
like
macbeth
who
couldn
t
say
amen
when
he
most
sorely
needed
a
word
of
prayer
i
used
to
think
after
all
that
gay
laughing
yet
melancholy
little
witch
blättchen
has
cunningly
infected
me
with
a
strain
of
her
keltic
superstition
she
is
rooted
in
two
nationalities
both
a
little
eerie
do
you
remember
that
tragic
dream
you
had
of
joining
the
throng
who
were
in
sorrow
now
confess
beloved
that
foolish
vision
made
you
a
little
afraid
but
after
this
you
can
not
believe
in
evil
dreams
i
give
you
notice
that
from
this
day
out
you
must
get
back
all
your
old
mockeries
and
mischief
and
quips
and
cranks
and
wreathed
smiles
as
for
me
i
foresee
that
i
shall
be
a
dreadful
happy
as
the
day
is
long
to
be
happy
at
home
is
the
ultimate
result
of
all
end
to
which
every
enterprise
and
labour
tends
johnson
must
have
known
people
like
me
when
he
said
that
of
course
i
don
t
mean
only
ourselves
liebe
i
have
planned
every
room
in
the
house
and
trained
creeping
laburnum
over
the
front
of
it
and
as
for
roses
they
grow
round
it
like
o
god
how
his
words
beat
upon
her
heart
her
lips
and
throat
were
so
parched
that
she
could
not
speak
ach
himmel
he
went
on
what
a
wretched
downcast
creature
i
was
yesterday
when
i
arrived
here
and
found
not
a
word
from
you
awaiting
me
did
you
expect
me
to
write
she
asked
slowly
and
with
an
effort
as
she
recalled
word
by
word
of
that
abrupt
short
letter
in
which
there
had
been
no
hint
of
any
future
communications
surely
he
forgot
how
cruelly
he
had
for
the
time
been
deceived
by
that
fatal
letter
a
portion
of
which
he
had
enclosed
to
her
expect
you
to
write
stella
he
echoed
looking
at
her
in
amazement
you
might
as
well
ask
if
i
expected
the
sun
to
rise
but
then
of
course
i
did
not
know
you
were
coming
to
this
side
of
the
world
in
less
than
a
month
after
i
set
sail
how
closely
after
all
we
are
enfolded
by
the
tabernacle
of
clay
yesterday
you
were
within
reach
of
me
and
yet
when
i
found
no
letters
here
and
telegraphed
to
london
and
found
none
had
been
delayed
there
nor
sent
on
to
brussels
too
late
to
reach
me
why
a
conviction
strong
as
life
fastened
on
me
that
something
was
horribly
wrong
i
was
about
to
send
a
cablegram
but
found
an
australian
mail
would
reach
london
so
i
waited
to
give
time
to
my
lawyer
to
send
any
on
that
might
have
come
but
i
was
as
miserable
last
night
as
i
am
happy
now
and
my
good
stepfather
would
talk
of
nothing
but
some
funeral
scrap
that
has
been
unearthed
of
a
hut
supposed
to
date
back
to
the
glacial
period
or
some
equally
impossible
time
yet
all
the
while
you
were
in
the
city
of
berlin
of
course
you
did
not
come
alone
liebe
is
it
with
esther
you
came
tell
me
did
hector
and
madonna
really
come
no
do
you
want
to
give
me
another
joyful
surprise
ah
my
poor
darling
you
have
been
very
she
was
indeed
paler
than
ever
and
trembling
at
intervals
all
to
frame
words
in
which
to
tell
him
all
yet
shrinking
from
the
as
one
shrinks
from
death
but
as
one
shrinks
from
stabbing
the
human
being
who
is
the
dearest
loved
in
all
god
s
wide
universe
a
species
of
physical
and
moral
syncope
had
fallen
on
her
in
which
for
the
time
nothing
was
possible
except
to
half
hide
her
face
and
hang
on
every
word
that
langdale
uttered
as
a
miser
might
gloat
over
the
treasure
that
is
soon
to
be
swept
for
ever
from
his
possession
a
dull
wonder
had
forced
itself
upon
her
when
he
spoke
of
his
disappointment
at
getting
no
letter
but
she
could
not
think
nor
could
only
in
the
feebleness
of
her
great
misery
postpone
the
moment
in
which
the
truth
must
be
revealed
did
you
have
a
good
passage
liebe
tell
me
the
very
day
on
which
you
left
why
that
was
just
days
after
i
did
and
our
voyage
was
longer
than
usual
we
had
no
storms
but
shortly
after
leaving
mauritius
our
engine
got
seriously
out
of
gear
and
that
made
us
ten
days
later
fortunately
the
sea
most
of
the
time
was
as
calm
as
a
great
swamp
i
used
to
pace
up
and
down
the
deck
for
hours
and
fancy
we
were
riding
side
by
side
over
the
peeloo
plain
did
you
not
find
that
a
quiet
sea
under
a
dim
light
is
wonderfully
like
a
grayish
horizonless
stretch
of
australian
scenery
tell
me
liebe
shall
you
want
to
return
soon
to
your
beloved
native
land
but
there
is
a
still
more
important
that
must
be
settled
this
shall
we
be
married
what
crying
my
own
tell
me
stella
is
there
some
trouble
i
do
not
know
your
mother
and
they
well
did
they
approve
of
your
coming
only
a
brave
intrepid
australian
girl
could
have
done
such
a
oh
anselm
do
not
praise
me
she
cried
in
a
choked
voice
a
wild
scheme
fashioned
itself
in
her
mind
to
get
away
before
he
would
learn
the
bid
him
farewell
and
then
write
and
tell
all
and
never
look
upon
his
face
again
but
all
seemed
to
have
deserted
her
there
was
a
dull
deep
noise
in
her
head
which
rose
at
times
and
drowned
all
sound
like
waves
moaning
against
a
rocky
shore
tell
me
about
the
fairacre
people
he
said
haunted
with
the
thought
that
some
family
trouble
weighed
on
her
they
were
all
well
maisie
i
brought
with
me
she
forced
herself
to
say
and
the
friends
with
whom
you
i
know
anything
of
them
by
the
way
liebe
do
you
know
that
i
hurried
here
at
my
stepfather
s
request
i
met
him
going
to
his
beloved
full
of
miniature
specimens
of
man
s
primitive
some
young
royal
highness
athirst
for
knowledge
you
must
come
with
me
to
see
them
if
you
go
with
the
professor
you
will
never
get
away
before
the
dawn
of
the
next
that
wouldn
t
suit
my
plans
in
the
least
you
only
you
remember
the
butterfly
kisses
you
used
to
give
lionel
give
me
just
two
of
them
in
memory
of
our
first
delightful
squabble
over
the
orphaned
little
he
held
his
cheek
against
hers
to
feel
the
flutter
of
her
eyelashes
but
instead
his
face
was
wet
with
her
tears
then
for
the
first
time
a
sudden
pang
of
fear
shot
into
his
heart
your
stepfather
may
soon
be
here
she
said
raising
her
pallid
face
yes
that
reminds
me
of
what
i
was
about
to
tell
you
stella
he
said
watching
her
face
with
a
growing
apprehension
of
some
unknown
disaster
dully
creeping
over
him
he
asked
me
to
hurry
here
to
do
the
honours
of
the
house
for
him
to
an
australian
know
he
visited
south
australia
in
the
beginning
of
this
ritchie
he
said
do
you
know
her
i
fancy
i
have
some
association
with
the
name
perhaps
you
came
with
i
suppose
also
you
know
the
professor
yes
i
know
him
she
whispered
looking
up
into
his
face
in
miserable
helplessness
her
lips
dry
and
quivering
unable
to
articulate
another
word
then
he
knew
that
there
was
some
trouble
she
had
to
tell
that
she
found
it
difficult
to
speak
of
she
had
several
brothers
perhaps
the
family
had
been
visited
by
one
of
those
trials
which
wound
people
even
more
bitterly
than
death
itself
he
resolved
that
she
must
tell
it
in
the
way
easiest
to
her
i
am
teasing
you
about
trifles
that
do
not
signify
love
there
is
some
trouble
that
weighs
on
you
but
do
not
speak
of
it
if
you
would
rather
not
only
remember
that
any
grief
which
comes
to
us
now
must
be
lighter
because
shared
between
us
ah
beloved
it
seems
incredible
almost
that
our
great
happiness
is
now
our
grasp
tell
me
was
there
time
for
you
to
get
the
i
sent
from
mauritius
i
got
only
the
one
terrible
letter
she
said
faintly
terrible
stella
did
you
then
blame
me
so
hardly
for
not
telling
you
all
from
the
first
perhaps
that
would
have
been
best
yet
it
was
to
save
you
unnecessary
anxiety
but
did
you
not
like
the
long
letter
blättchen
the
long
letter
anselm
there
was
only
the
one
short
dreadful
blotted
one
and
the
part
of
that
one
some
woman
sent
the
rumour
of
death
was
she
spoke
slowly
hesitatingly
as
if
not
certain
that
the
words
she
used
would
convey
her
meaning
sweet
me
what
you
mean
i
have
not
the
least
clue
i
wrote
briefly
in
a
separate
note
the
cause
of
my
visit
to
england
i
knew
that
virtually
i
was
free
to
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
but
i
wanted
the
legal
vouchers
and
as
i
said
the
moment
i
got
your
letter
i
felt
that
to
keep
silence
was
appear
to
you
as
a
lack
of
confidence
and
i
knew
my
darling
i
could
trust
you
through
life
and
death
then
with
that
brief
statement
there
was
a
much
longer
second
to
you
which
i
tried
to
say
a
little
of
the
thousand
things
that
were
in
my
heart
i
enclosed
them
together
and
gave
the
letter
safely
into
your
friend
s
possession
when
i
found
that
you
had
gone
out
of
town
and
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
my
seeing
you
but
what
other
letter
do
you
speak
of
my
dear
one
have
you
had
a
fever
are
you
mixing
this
up
with
some
grief
betrayed
betrayed
betrayed
she
moaned
with
ashy
lips
she
had
drawn
away
from
him
and
leant
against
the
back
of
the
couch
white
as
death
slowly
grasping
the
treachery
that
had
been
put
on
them
stella
dearest
speak
to
me
tell
me
all
that
causes
your
anguish
do
you
repent
coming
do
you
love
me
less
than
you
did
oh
no
only
love
god
help
us
at
the
sound
of
the
agony
in
her
voice
something
of
panic
seized
him
is
it
that
you
did
not
get
my
a
false
one
was
given
to
you
i
got
a
letter
addressed
in
your
hand
posted
in
posted
but
i
delivered
it
by
hand
when
i
found
that
you
were
away
on
the
of
day
i
i
was
not
away
i
did
not
go
out
of
melbourne
for
half
a
day
during
the
whole
of
my
great
heavens
what
made
that
woman
lie
so
infamously
tell
me
my
darling
what
was
in
the
letter
you
got
you
spoke
of
an
unfinished
one
from
some
woman
do
you
remember
the
words
stella
roused
by
the
shock
of
discovering
this
treachery
repeated
word
for
word
first
the
unfinished
letter
in
some
woman
s
anselm
s
telling
of
its
abrupt
beginning
and
close
with
its
many
erasures
one
of
at
the
but
not
illegible
oh
stella
could
you
believe
that
i
would
write
like
that
and
enclose
such
a
letter
even
if
it
had
come
i
would
at
least
have
seen
then
you
could
not
imagine
that
such
a
diabolical
imposition
was
possible
but
why
did
this
woman
whom
you
visited
as
an
equal
behave
worse
than
a
common
thief
he
asked
with
gathering
wrath
as
he
thought
of
the
misery
stella
must
have
endured
she
had
her
reasons
and
she
succeeded
murmured
stella
and
then
she
slowly
rose
up
the
moment
had
come
when
he
must
know
all
her
gloves
fell
to
the
ground
and
as
he
lifted
them
up
a
ring
fell
out
of
one
and
rolled
under
the
table
ah
careless
little
liebchen
is
this
the
way
you
let
our
ring
slip
off
with
its
tender
old
italian
motto
but
this
is
not
the
ring
i
gave
you
darling
child
he
smiled
but
there
was
a
growing
fear
in
his
face
no
wear
that
ring
next
my
the
biting
tragedy
of
their
and
betrayed
as
they
had
been
on
every
her
marriage
appear
to
her
each
successive
moment
more
and
more
in
the
light
of
a
mocking
farce
why
is
a
he
looked
at
her
but
she
neither
spoke
nor
met
his
whose
is
it
he
waited
for
her
answer
in
sickening
suspense
to
their
dying
hour
they
must
both
remember
the
awful
only
by
the
sullen
ticking
of
a
clock
and
then
the
strains
of
a
military
band
that
suddenly
broke
out
into
die
wacht
am
for
god
s
sake
stella
tell
me
how
this
ring
came
to
be
in
your
glove
whose
is
it
the
agony
in
his
voice
made
the
words
beat
upon
her
heart
with
unendurable
pain
it
is
mine
came
the
answer
at
last
with
a
low
wailing
sound
when
he
heard
that
he
stood
looking
at
her
his
lips
parted
in
breathless
incredulous
horror
again
there
was
a
deep
silence
this
time
it
was
broken
by
the
miserable
sobbing
of
a
woman
whose
head
was
bent
in
bitter
shame
and
yet
so
strong
and
deep
was
the
man
s
faith
he
had
not
yet
grasped
the
worst
the
was
hers
she
was
then
on
the
eve
of
marrying
some
man
in
whose
interest
or
through
whom
all
these
foul
treacheries
had
been
practised
she
had
carried
the
ring
with
her
she
was
on
the
eve
of
marrying
misled
by
the
unscrupulous
plotting
of
this
abandoned
woman
it
must
have
been
with
her
she
had
come
ah
now
matters
grew
clearer
he
recalled
miss
morton
s
story
of
stella
s
supposed
own
admission
of
having
been
engaged
for
a
week
it
was
to
the
brother
of
this
woman
with
whom
stella
stayed
it
was
to
renew
that
engagement
then
that
this
incredible
fraud
had
been
practised
and
it
had
almost
succeeded
thank
god
it
was
not
too
late
to
defeat
this
wicked
cruel
scheme
these
thoughts
flashed
through
his
brain
like
no
wonder
she
was
wan
with
misery
what
had
she
not
endured
during
the
nine
weeks
that
had
passed
since
they
parted
oh
to
think
that
through
their
devilish
stratagem
she
should
be
made
to
believe
he
could
have
written
such
words
after
giving
him
her
entire
love
and
confidence
darling
do
not
be
so
it
kills
me
to
see
you
like
this
all
will
yet
be
well
we
have
found
each
other
once
more
that
makes
up
for
she
struggled
for
composure
seeking
to
frame
words
that
would
extinguish
the
last
spark
of
his
hope
but
she
could
could
not
utter
them
the
exhausting
struggle
the
determination
not
to
be
overborne
by
grief
the
constantly
recurring
effort
to
treat
the
part
that
langdale
had
played
in
her
life
as
obliterated
had
been
but
a
feeble
subterfuge
like
a
torrent
long
pent
up
the
passion
of
her
love
rose
and
took
possession
of
her
what
law
of
god
or
man
could
justify
the
semblance
of
a
marriage
compassed
by
the
vilest
imposition
she
saw
that
in
some
way
langdale
had
not
yet
comprehended
the
full
extent
of
the
intolerable
falsehood
yes
that
was
the
history
of
her
marriage
from
beginning
to
impossible
lie
anselm
take
me
away
she
said
going
up
to
him
and
placing
her
hands
in
his
my
dear
one
do
not
be
afraid
no
contract
entered
upon
through
such
gross
imposition
can
bind
let
us
go
where
would
you
like
to
go
beloved
oh
away
to
the
away
from
everyone
i
do
not
want
anyone
in
the
whole
world
but
you
you
do
not
love
me
any
less
you
are
my
own
only
love
are
you
not
oh
anselm
do
not
leave
me
whatever
never
again
stella
we
shall
be
married
this
very
day
i
shall
see
these
people
and
return
this
she
tried
to
smile
but
broke
instead
into
wild
hysterical
laughter
the
blood
had
surged
to
her
head
her
lips
and
cheeks
were
like
coals
and
there
was
a
glittering
light
in
her
eyes
take
me
away
anselm
do
not
believe
them
if
they
say
i
do
not
belong
to
you
it
was
all
a
horrible
fraud
anselm
do
you
understand
me
yes
my
beloved
i
understand
i
understand
how
this
misery
has
worked
on
your
mind
he
answered
in
a
low
soothing
voice
his
lips
quivering
as
he
looked
at
her
his
practised
eyes
read
too
well
the
symptoms
of
the
fever
that
possessed
her
it
had
lain
latent
in
her
blood
for
many
days
and
had
been
fanned
by
this
hour
of
strange
wild
misery
into
fierce
life
ah
but
i
must
tell
before
we
go
there
must
be
perfect
truth
between
us
they
wove
such
a
frightful
mesh
of
deceit
round
me
the
air
is
full
of
chokes
me
you
and
i
anselm
must
be
free
people
under
an
open
sky
no
concealment
no
duplicity
no
seeming
do
you
not
see
how
that
little
rift
at
the
beginning
has
wrecked
us
you
wished
me
to
tell
hector
and
i
would
not
ah
dear
madonna
she
would
not
have
let
their
poison
fasten
on
for
god
s
sake
do
not
look
away
there
are
tears
in
your
eyes
i
may
cry
because
i
am
a
weak
foolish
faulty
woman
but
you
must
not
you
must
be
strong
for
us
yes
my
darling
i
will
be
strong
he
replied
in
a
broken
voice
and
you
my
dear
you
not
make
me
happy
by
sitting
beside
me
and
resting
no
oh
no
i
must
not
rest
i
must
tell
you
you
must
understand
how
it
is
do
you
know
anselm
that
treachery
is
the
worst
poison
of
all
i
will
confess
to
you
that
since
we
have
stood
face
to
face
i
have
formed
two
plans
of
deceiving
you
the
first
was
i
would
kiss
you
as
though
i
would
see
you
again
and
then
write
you
a
letter
and
never
look
into
your
face
again
was
not
that
a
wild
infidelity
to
enter
into
my
heart
oh
what
a
wicked
wicked
to
see
you
again
belovedest
and
all
that
has
grown
out
of
their
duping
me
and
the
other
forget
the
other
your
head
pains
you
terribly
my
know
it
yes
it
beats
all
over
it
and
sometimes
when
your
lips
move
i
can
hardly
hear
what
you
are
saying
but
i
must
tell
you
before
you
take
me
away
do
you
know
beloved
how
i
now
loathe
the
smallest
speck
of
concealment
it
grows
and
grows
till
it
makes
a
horrible
stifling
atmosphere
all
round
heavy
and
thick
with
poison
it
must
be
like
clear
fine
crystal
all
round
us
oh
how
they
smothered
my
whole
life
with
lies
they
destroyed
your
long
beautiful
letter
that
i
would
have
kissed
and
put
close
against
my
heart
and
thanked
god
for
on
my
knees
day
and
i
would
have
stolen
away
to
read
over
and
over
to
myself
till
i
knew
every
word
of
it
by
heart
it
would
have
flooded
my
life
with
fresh
love
and
hope
but
instead
of
it
they
gave
me
one
that
was
turned
into
a
tissue
of
awful
and
hard
and
cruel
but
with
your
name
at
the
end
clear
as
the
sun
at
and
with
your
letter
they
put
a
woman
s
lying
message
i
saw
you
day
and
and
day
sailing
away
to
another
your
to
the
one
who
had
been
misrepresented
who
still
loved
you
i
followed
you
on
and
on
till
you
reached
i
saw
you
in
her
arms
and
my
blood
was
on
fire
i
dared
not
go
back
to
the
old
quiet
harmonious
days
to
my
mother
s
peaceful
home
where
fierce
jealousy
and
the
stain
of
unlawful
love
were
only
things
hidden
away
within
the
covers
of
old
tragedies
don
t
you
understand
anselm
how
i
loathed
furiously
jealous
because
a
husband
was
hastening
back
to
the
wife
he
had
unwittingly
wronged
i
tried
to
take
comfort
in
the
belief
she
would
win
you
back
to
happiness
but
there
was
insanity
in
the
thought
and
i
flung
it
from
me
i
seemed
to
look
into
black
depths
yawning
in
my
soul
i
could
not
deceive
myself
i
told
myself
if
you
had
come
trampling
on
the
bond
that
held
you
i
would
have
left
all
and
followed
you
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
you
were
my
highest
conscience
what
you
asked
me
to
do
i
would
have
done
glorying
in
the
thought
of
making
some
real
sacrifice
for
your
oh
my
darling
i
know
all
the
depth
of
your
great
love
your
eyes
are
dim
with
pain
let
me
soothe
you
into
calmness
he
came
to
her
where
she
stood
leaning
against
the
back
of
the
but
when
he
put
his
arms
round
her
she
drew
back
no
anselm
let
me
tell
you
all
then
i
will
be
calm
and
you
shall
decide
all
these
things
have
been
feeding
on
me
shrivelling
all
that
was
good
in
me
till
i
began
to
reconcile
look
forward
to
a
mere
blunted
soulless
existence
as
something
to
live
ah
my
dear
one
you
wrong
yourself
that
you
never
could
do
anselm
you
do
not
know
all
for
years
i
have
been
slumbering
through
existence
looking
on
amused
at
the
play
untouched
by
passion
till
i
knew
you
and
when
the
forces
that
had
thrilled
me
through
and
through
were
turned
all
the
better
purpose
of
life
was
consciously
made
choice
of
the
lower
part
because
i
knew
myself
too
well
to
fancy
that
anything
of
the
old
magic
could
return
it
was
so
in
religion
when
the
old
vivid
faith
left
me
it
never
returned
and
now
do
i
not
know
what
fond
delusions
we
put
upon
ourselves
when
we
speak
of
the
goodness
and
fatherhood
of
god
hush
my
darling
do
not
speak
like
that
you
know
what
beautiful
holy
thoughts
came
to
yes
when
you
once
more
woke
the
deeper
more
spiritual
side
of
my
nature
but
what
became
of
me
when
i
lost
you
the
only
purpose
that
made
bare
existence
tolerable
was
to
get
away
from
all
that
reminded
me
of
the
past
no
family
affection
no
love
of
books
no
thought
of
god
could
give
me
the
smallest
consolation
was
submerged
in
the
fever
of
passion
only
to
forget
and
do
you
not
understand
anselm
that
marriage
without
love
was
no
more
forbidding
than
the
whole
of
existence
without
love
and
then
i
had
known
him
from
but
all
that
is
changed
now
stella
do
not
dwell
on
it
i
implore
you
he
said
but
the
fear
that
had
lodged
so
icily
in
his
breast
had
deepened
though
not
an
inkling
of
the
dreadful
truth
had
yet
come
to
him
and
he
was
rich
yes
that
counts
if
you
are
thrown
back
on
the
lees
of
life
and
yet
at
the
last
when
it
was
too
late
as
i
listened
to
my
mother
that
evening
a
conviction
came
over
me
if
i
had
only
i
had
not
been
so
insanely
impatient
bent
on
drowning
my
sorrow
and
humiliation
in
your
patience
ye
shall
win
your
souls
that
was
one
of
the
things
my
mother
said
to
me
the
day
before
my
unhappy
your
unhappy
marriage
stella
what
are
you
saying
he
cried
drawing
close
to
her
his
lips
parted
in
stony
horror
yes
is
not
that
what
it
is
called
when
lifelong
vows
are
made
in
blind
ignorance
though
they
are
found
to
be
impossible
lies
she
stopped
abruptly
no
not
even
in
that
hour
when
she
was
borne
by
the
flood
of
misery
which
burst
upon
her
far
from
the
calm
reserves
of
ordinary
life
could
she
reveal
the
double
duplicity
of
her
miserable
marriage
langdale
at
once
interpreted
her
words
and
sudden
silence
to
mean
that
the
man
to
whom
she
was
married
was
accessory
to
the
criminal
imposition
practised
on
her
great
god
stella
are
you
saying
he
cried
in
a
faint
voice
his
face
deadly
white
strong
man
though
he
was
with
a
training
which
inures
the
mind
to
sudden
catastrophes
in
life
he
was
forced
to
lean
heavily
against
an
armchair
by
which
he
stood
as
the
full
force
of
the
ruin
that
had
overtaken
her
life
dawned
on
him
yes
anselm
now
you
know
why
after
the
first
joy
of
seeing
you
i
was
silent
and
afraid
you
know
how
that
ring
is
part
of
the
mockery
ah
anselm
how
strangely
you
look
at
me
you
despise
me
oh
i
can
not
bear
that
she
gave
a
low
cry
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
it
was
an
old
habit
often
had
he
seen
her
indulge
in
it
when
telling
tales
to
the
lullaboolagana
children
in
the
twilight
or
expressing
mock
contrition
for
letting
fly
some
shaft
of
raillery
that
had
too
keen
an
edge
the
action
with
its
old
mirthful
associations
stung
him
in
that
hour
of
almost
unreal
misery
with
intolerable
pain
and
yet
there
was
a
shadow
of
anger
on
his
face
the
revulsion
of
bitter
disappointment
the
cruel
thought
that
a
little
patience
a
little
waiting
would
have
saved
their
lives
from
this
dark
shipwreck
rendered
him
for
the
moment
almost
blind
to
her
anguish
how
could
you
dare
to
marry
any
man
when
you
loved
another
he
said
looking
at
her
sternly
ah
you
are
going
to
leave
me
she
said
in
a
low
broken
voice
forgive
me
before
we
part
me
beloved
for
old
love
s
sake
it
is
getting
me
what
to
do
i
have
been
piecing
my
life
together
somehow
believing
those
letters
but
shall
i
go
what
is
to
become
of
me
she
looked
into
his
face
in
helpless
misery
and
a
sudden
desperate
resolve
formed
itself
in
his
mind
stella
we
have
been
criminally
treacherously
duped
and
deceived
but
you
are
mine
and
i
am
yours
and
this
miserable
mockery
of
a
our
whole
lives
to
be
sacrificed
to
this
duplicity
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
anselm
she
said
drawing
nearer
to
him
you
must
decide
quickly
i
can
not
think
my
head
swims
so
strangely
do
not
take
me
away
i
must
he
took
her
hands
in
his
and
they
almost
scorched
him
the
delirium
of
fever
was
in
her
face
and
voice
he
fought
with
the
whirl
of
feelings
that
threatened
to
reduce
him
to
the
weakness
of
a
woman
and
then
answered
in
a
low
emotionless
voice
no
stella
i
will
not
take
you
away
till
you
have
calmly
faced
the
question
in
all
its
bearings
you
have
been
ill
for
some
time
you
are
in
a
high
fever
now
you
must
rest
stella
you
must
regain
composure
for
my
sake
and
your
even
as
he
looked
at
her
he
saw
that
a
certain
vacancy
had
come
into
her
face
you
must
give
me
those
letters
stella
that
you
thought
i
sent
you
they
furnish
proof
of
the
wicked
imposition
that
misled
you
ah
my
darling
my
darling
how
you
have
suffered
night
and
day
you
must
get
well
and
strong
do
not
despair
all
is
not
his
quiet
deep
voice
penetrated
her
with
an
involuntary
sense
of
being
directed
and
absolved
from
the
necessity
of
action
at
this
time
the
burning
sensation
in
her
temples
had
increased
to
an
overpowering
vehemence
i
am
not
as
ill
as
you
imagine
she
said
her
voice
sinking
to
a
whisper
but
even
as
she
spoke
a
dimness
fell
on
her
eyes
and
she
swayed
as
though
she
would
have
fallen
he
led
her
to
the
chair
by
which
he
stood
and
knelt
at
her
feet
raising
her
hands
reverently
to
his
lips
stella
you
know
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
whole
world
i
care
for
but
to
help
protect
you
from
all
evil
do
you
not
i
do
yes
i
do
she
whispered
repeating
the
words
over
and
over
as
if
they
were
the
refrain
of
a
song
her
face
had
blanched
somewhat
and
a
great
exhaustion
was
creeping
over
her
he
released
her
hands
and
she
raised
them
tremblingly
kissing
them
one
by
one
where
his
lips
had
touched
them
he
saw
the
action
and
he
turned
away
quickly
gazing
for
a
few
moments
out
through
the
window
but
seeing
naught
she
leant
back
with
closed
eyes
as
if
asleep
but
opened
them
presently
looking
round
with
a
perplexed
expression
i
do
not
know
this
place
do
i
how
quiet
it
is
with
the
busts
of
people
dead
and
all
the
grief
hidden
away
in
books
how
very
very
far
away
everything
seems
but
you
are
here
anselm
you
have
not
left
me
yes
stella
i
am
then
there
was
silence
again
presently
there
was
a
ring
and
the
was
opened
langdale
went
out
and
met
his
stepfather
in
the
hall
well
anselm
have
you
seen
my
australian
friend
ritchie
he
asked
in
a
cheery
voice
as
he
put
down
one
or
two
books
and
a
bundle
of
proofs
damp
from
the
printer
s
end
drew
off
his
gloves
does
she
not
speak
german
with
wonderful
verve
she
is
still
here
ah
that
is
is
good
i
thought
she
would
find
kleinsauber
s
comparative
ethnology
a
fascinating
work
you
see
with
all
her
vivacity
she
has
an
unusual
love
of
knowledge
in
that
she
is
like
your
sister
combination
which
is
above
all
others
calculated
to
make
a
woman
very
true
answered
langdale
gravely
and
then
he
told
the
professor
that
the
australian
lady
seemed
suddenly
he
feared
she
was
far
from
well
ah
now
that
you
speak
of
it
i
have
thought
each
time
i
saw
her
that
she
was
greatly
paler
and
thinner
oh
she
is
staying
only
a
few
houses
away
her
husband
is
in
london
she
must
come
and
stay
with
us
as
soon
as
your
mother
the
good
professor
hurried
into
the
study
my
dear
young
lady
you
are
not
well
perhaps
you
have
been
reading
kleinsauber
s
book
too
closely
you
saw
it
the
moment
you
came
in
of
on
the
table
it
is
wonderful
wonderful
etc
the
kind
benevolent
old
face
bending
over
her
with
anxious
solicitude
helped
stella
a
little
to
recall
her
straying
faculties
when
she
spoke
of
going
the
professor
proposed
to
get
a
hackney
carriage
but
stella
said
the
little
walk
through
the
fresh
air
would
revive
her
the
professor
and
langdale
walked
with
her
to
the
pension
and
she
bade
them
at
the
door
saying
that
she
would
be
better
on
the
morrow
early
next
day
langdale
received
the
two
fatal
letters
which
stella
enclosed
with
the
words
i
can
not
see
very
well
nor
think
things
are
going
away
from
me
i
only
know
i
will
do
whatever
you
that
night
she
was
prostrated
with
acute
fever
she
lay
for
weeks
hovering
between
life
and
death
time
after
time
the
crisis
seemed
to
have
passed
but
a
disastrous
wave
of
recollection
would
sweep
over
her
and
then
the
fever
itself
once
more
but
in
the
end
her
youth
and
hitherto
unbroken
physique
triumphed
she
struggled
back
to
life
shaken
and
wasted
day
by
day
she
gained
a
little
strength
but
mentally
a
strange
change
had
been
wrought
she
remembered
all
that
had
passed
but
the
sources
of
emotion
seemed
atrophied
it
was
like
a
moral
aphasia
she
had
forgotten
how
to
feel
and
she
shrank
from
the
possibility
of
mental
suffering
with
a
certain
morbid
horror
all
the
passion
and
ardour
and
power
of
vivid
emotion
had
left
her
if
she
could
be
glad
for
anything
she
would
have
been
glad
that
now
at
last
she
knew
what
it
was
to
have
a
sluggish
heart
equally
steeled
against
hope
and
memory
it
was
in
berlin
on
the
last
day
of
february
after
a
succession
of
stormy
days
of
unusual
severity
a
hard
frost
set
in
which
had
lasted
now
nearly
a
week
the
thiergarten
all
save
the
footpaths
was
deep
in
snow
crisp
glittering
and
frozen
over
the
trees
to
the
tips
of
the
slenderest
twigs
were
thickly
frosted
and
gleaming
in
their
coating
of
unspotted
purity
but
the
keen
clear
sky
which
had
lent
such
brilliancy
to
the
frost
for
some
days
was
now
completely
overcast
another
storm
was
evidently
gathering
the
heavens
wondrously
low
down
were
unbroken
in
their
heavy
sullen
background
piled
up
with
heavy
banks
of
clouds
and
vapoury
masses
of
smoke
there
was
not
a
break
nor
a
even
a
tone
of
paler
gray
or
lead
show
where
behind
all
the
sun
must
somewhere
be
shining
the
contrast
between
the
lowering
sky
and
the
trees
in
their
gleaming
delicate
white
splendour
made
up
a
wonderful
scene
for
eyes
that
had
never
before
seen
any
of
the
moods
of
a
northern
winter
stella
who
had
by
this
time
passed
the
first
stage
of
convalescence
sat
by
one
of
the
large
double
windows
of
their
in
the
eisengau
pension
looking
at
the
scene
with
an
impassive
gaze
a
book
lay
open
on
a
table
near
needlework
had
fallen
to
her
feet
where
dustiefoot
lay
alternately
dozing
off
into
a
light
slumber
and
looking
up
at
his
mistress
as
if
longing
for
some
sign
of
recognition
ritchie
sat
near
the
open
fireplace
the
only
one
in
the
house
and
constructed
for
an
english
invalid
who
had
stayed
there
for
a
couple
of
years
some
time
previously
there
was
a
glowing
coal
fire
whose
lambent
flames
were
joyously
thrown
back
by
tiles
that
lined
the
fireplace
each
with
figures
more
or
less
classic
or
symbolical
ritchie
looked
up
from
the
sporting
newspaper
he
was
reading
and
stared
into
the
fire
for
some
time
with
knitted
brows
then
his
eyes
rested
on
some
of
these
figures
with
a
look
of
marked
disapproval
i
say
she
turned
round
with
a
start
i
wish
you
would
come
and
tell
me
what
some
of
these
old
hags
are
doing
or
what
they
mean
just
look
at
this
one
with
a
stick
something
like
a
handle
and
a
shock
of
wool
on
he
placed
a
chair
for
stella
and
she
looked
at
the
figure
he
pointed
out
with
a
slow
smile
breaking
on
her
face
why
that
is
clotho
one
of
the
inexorable
sisters
the
daughters
of
night
and
well
that
is
all
greek
to
me
why
do
people
put
three
females
round
a
with
a
rum
sort
of
stick
the
other
with
a
ball
of
twine
and
this
old
party
with
a
pair
of
shears
as
if
she
were
going
to
cut
a
fellow
s
jugular
vein
that
is
her
trade
you
must
know
the
old
greeks
had
many
tales
and
symbols
of
man
s
life
these
are
the
three
women
who
preside
over
our
destinies
clotho
with
her
spindle
spins
the
thread
of
life
lachesis
measures
its
length
and
atropos
with
the
abhorred
shears
cuts
it
then
according
to
that
this
is
the
old
vixen
who
nearly
did
for
you
stella
look
at
the
squint
of
the
old
banshee
thank
god
she
didn
t
have
a
snip
at
you
with
her
shears
this
time
but
it
would
have
been
so
much
easier
to
die
than
come
back
bit
by
bit
so
weak
and
shaken
i
remember
i
had
an
old
doll
once
i
was
very
fond
of
its
hair
fell
off
and
the
blue
came
out
of
its
eyes
and
its
complexion
disappeared
altogether
last
of
all
a
kangaroo
pup
of
tom
s
ran
away
with
it
and
took
its
head
off
and
i
never
found
it
again
but
i
got
the
head
of
another
defunct
doll
and
i
got
tom
to
fasten
it
on
to
sheba
somehow
i
feel
just
as
she
must
have
felt
ted
are
you
sure
that
seemann
did
not
screw
someone
else
s
head
on
me
when
you
talk
to
me
a
little
i
am
quite
sure
he
didn
t
but
by
jove
stella
it
was
an
awful
close
shave
i
had
just
got
hack
from
the
old
man
s
funeral
and
was
going
into
the
to
hear
the
will
read
when
i
got
the
telegram
maisie
sent
and
for
a
bit
i
thought
to
myself
it
s
all
u
p
old
man
for
though
i
didn
t
say
much
i
could
see
you
were
awfully
ill
all
the
time
once
on
board
ship
a
fellow
who
was
very
hadn
t
come
out
of
his
cabin
the
first
two
with
me
on
the
deck
the
first
day
he
came
up
we
had
got
pretty
chummy
for
his
cabin
was
next
to
mine
and
i
often
did
little
things
for
up
the
doctor
once
when
poor
old
lakemann
seemed
to
be
choking
well
we
were
walking
up
and
down
and
he
spied
you
sitting
back
and
looking
away
over
the
of
the
miss
o
briens
near
you
who
is
that
lady
says
he
and
i
saw
he
was
looking
at
you
that
is
my
wife
said
i
no
said
he
i
don
t
mean
that
young
lady
i
could
almost
tell
without
being
told
she
is
your
wife
i
mean
that
one
leaning
back
looking
exactly
like
a
she
must
have
seen
a
ghost
some
time
he
would
hardly
believe
i
wasn
t
putting
a
hoax
on
him
when
i
said
you
were
my
wife
and
not
miss
harry
o
brien
many
a
time
after
that
i
thought
you
did
just
look
as
if
you
were
awake
in
your
sleeping
awake
oh
bother
you
know
what
i
yes
but
you
must
think
of
something
more
lively
to
tell
me
i
am
very
tired
of
myself
oh
but
i
want
to
talk
a
little
about
yourself
stella
always
when
i
want
to
talk
to
you
since
you
got
well
enough
to
speak
someone
is
in
the
way
or
you
are
not
up
or
you
have
gone
to
bed
or
there
is
a
silent
fit
on
old
seemann
said
to
me
don
t
make
her
talk
when
she
doesn
t
want
to
till
she
is
built
up
if
you
were
a
wall
or
a
has
it
been
very
dull
for
you
in
berlin
all
these
weeks
ted
well
it
didn
t
matter
to
me
a
straw
where
i
was
while
you
were
so
ill
stella
but
since
you
ve
been
out
of
danger
i
ve
been
toddling
round
you
see
i
know
several
fellows
now
the
avenells
came
across
in
the
same
boat
with
me
dick
the
eldest
of
them
is
in
the
british
attaché
they
call
it
he
speaks
of
his
duties
but
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
his
work
is
to
always
wear
a
neat
suit
and
a
flower
in
his
buttonhole
and
play
scat
and
billiards
of
course
he
has
to
go
to
and
balls
and
the
worst
of
it
is
he
often
has
to
dance
attendance
on
a
fat
old
frump
half
the
night
instead
of
looking
after
some
pretty
girl
that
s
the
very
worst
aspect
of
diplomacy
he
says
and
then
farningham
here
is
very
good
any
rate
he
s
the
sort
i
get
on
with
and
you
like
farningham
yes
very
much
returned
stella
but
her
voice
all
the
time
was
perfectly
level
and
emotionless
is
it
farningham
or
his
wife
that
is
related
to
the
old
professor
you
met
at
stein
s
it
is
farningham
her
mother
is
married
to
the
and
there
was
a
came
from
the
professor
s
every
day
sometimes
twice
to
ask
for
you
till
you
were
out
of
t
he
another
relation
of
farningham
s
her
she
shivered
a
little
as
if
she
were
cold
and
ted
heaped
more
coal
on
the
fire
ah
now
i
begin
to
get
things
a
little
straight
i
ve
sometimes
been
most
awfully
mixed
up
my
wife
s
farningham
says
my
stepchildren
my
wife
s
stepfather
my
my
wife
s
my
my
wife
s
just
like
one
of
those
affairs
like
a
little
telescope
you
turn
round
and
see
different
snaps
of
things
spluttering
at
you
every
blessed
shake
you
see
farningham
s
first
husband
s
people
are
here
from
america
in
shoals
it
s
a
jolly
good
thing
there
wasn
t
room
for
many
of
them
in
this
t
you
like
them
oh
i
d
like
them
well
enough
if
there
weren
t
so
many
women
among
them
with
not
a
blessed
turn
to
do
but
ask
a
fellow
all
the
time
like
a
bell
on
a
runaway
steer
there
s
one
of
them
a
tall
thin
woman
with
eyes
like
she
s
got
about
twenty
hairs
on
her
scalp
and
twenty
skewers
to
keep
them
in
a
tiny
bob
on
top
of
her
head
leaving
her
long
lean
neck
perfectly
bare
i
m
not
what
you
d
call
a
prude
you
know
but
by
george
the
nakedness
of
that
neck
gives
me
a
sort
of
a
turn
she
writes
for
two
newspapers
and
she
has
a
red
morocco
sort
of
book
with
an
indelible
pencil
and
sometimes
she
stops
in
the
middle
of
eating
her
soup
to
put
something
down
in
this
i
dare
not
trust
my
memory
it
s
so
treacherous
she
says
by
the
lord
thinks
i
to
myself
i
wish
it
were
so
treacherous
you
d
forget
to
ask
me
questions
yes
i
sit
next
to
her
at
the
hôte
and
there
she
goes
at
me
hammer
and
tongs
and
the
less
i
know
about
the
things
she
s
interested
in
the
more
i
catch
her
using
the
indelible
pencil
on
the
sly
now
ritchie
you
are
laughing
at
me
when
you
say
you
heard
of
raphael
or
michael
angelo
she
ll
say
screwing
her
long
neck
round
above
my
head
like
a
native
companion
in
a
fit
ah
she
s
yards
taller
than
i
am
wait
till
you
see
her
and
there
farningham
sits
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
grinning
at
me
like
a
negro
minstrel
let
me
see
she
s
his
wife
s
first
husband
s
first
cousin
s
aunt
once
removed
now
what
relation
would
you
say
she
is
to
farningham
i
really
haven
t
the
faintest
conception
returned
stella
with
a
little
smile
no
more
has
he
but
she
calls
him
charles
and
speaks
to
him
solemnly
about
the
privileged
classes
in
england
you
know
he
is
to
be
sir
charles
when
his
governor
dies
and
then
she
reminds
him
of
things
that
happened
to
his
wife
s
first
husband
as
if
he
were
the
one
you
know
now
i
call
that
deuced
awkward
at
any
rate
it
might
be
in
many
cases
i
dare
say
it
would
be
more
damaging
to
the
other
fellow
though
if
farningham
had
been
the
first
husband
they
say
farningham
s
eldest
boy
by
her
first
husband
will
be
a
millionaire
when
he
is
but
he
is
a
delicate
little
chap
am
i
talking
too
much
stella
oh
no
it
s
rather
amusing
i
thought
by
something
farningham
let
fall
that
some
of
her
american
connections
were
a
little
trying
but
she
did
not
say
much
she
s
very
loyal
to
she
s
a
regular
trump
she
says
the
right
thing
to
everybody
and
she
s
like
you
stella
she
never
gets
the
least
sticks
her
back
up
but
takes
everything
as
if
it
were
rather
fun
she
had
a
bad
illness
in
dresden
but
she
has
got
over
it
so
s
better
than
she
was
before
i
wish
you
were
like
that
what
does
old
seemann
mean
by
some
mischief
before
the
fever
came
on
was
it
that
shock
stella
you
know
what
i
she
put
up
her
hands
to
her
head
wearily
i
know
what
you
mean
ted
but
there
was
something
besides
that
and
the
day
i
was
taken
ill
it
came
all
over
again
but
worse
only
nothing
seems
very
bad
now
i
do
not
think
i
should
talk
about
things
that
used
to
hurt
me
it
can
not
be
helped
any
more
nothing
can
that
has
gone
really
she
gave
a
long
low
sigh
and
lay
back
with
closed
eyes
don
t
say
that
stella
please
said
ted
gently
it
was
awfully
steep
to
think
i
was
the
cause
of
all
when
your
life
hung
on
a
thread
i
used
to
go
to
the
opera
and
places
but
often
i
didn
t
know
whether
i
was
standing
on
my
head
or
my
you
are
not
to
blame
for
my
illness
ted
if
anyone
is
to
blame
it
is
laurette
but
i
myself
most
of
all
oh
i
don
t
mean
what
she
concealed
about
ted
looked
perplexed
but
he
would
ask
no
questions
and
indeed
he
attributed
stella
s
words
to
some
confusion
left
by
the
fever
it
may
be
noted
in
passing
that
stella
did
not
once
suspect
him
of
any
complicity
in
the
imposition
that
had
wrecked
her
life
only
at
this
period
she
would
have
rejected
the
word
wrecked
as
being
too
strong
everything
had
shrunk
so
inconceivably
it
was
as
though
nothing
mattered
very
much
if
only
one
were
left
in
perfect
quiet
dr
seemann
is
to
come
only
every
second
day
now
he
told
me
said
ted
in
a
cheerful
voice
what
a
stunning
old
chap
he
is
the
best
fever
doctor
in
berlin
they
say
and
you
can
t
easily
beat
that
it
was
the
professor
who
saw
to
his
attending
there
was
silence
for
a
few
moments
and
then
stella
said
very
slowly
do
you
know
when
langdale
came
to
berlin
she
named
him
without
the
least
tremor
no
but
i
remember
the
first
time
i
noticed
him
particularly
it
was
two
weeks
after
i
came
back
i
was
at
the
with
dick
avenell
we
went
out
into
the
wide
passage
behind
the
boxes
and
there
dick
met
a
couple
of
very
lively
little
french
ladies
i
don
t
think
they
were
any
better
than
they
ought
to
be
you
but
a
couple
of
roses
and
a
dagger
with
diamonds
in
the
handle
by
way
of
a
bodice
dick
swore
i
had
just
come
from
new
caledonia
and
had
brought
a
message
from
some
of
their
friends
there
after
a
little
time
he
dodged
round
a
pillar
all
at
once
and
left
me
talking
to
them
alone
at
least
they
were
jabbering
away
half
in
french
and
i
put
in
a
word
edgeways
now
and
then
in
english
but
i
m
blessed
if
i
could
tell
what
any
of
us
were
saying
in
the
middle
of
it
who
should
come
round
but
this
langdale
with
his
mother
i
had
seen
him
once
or
twice
when
he
came
to
inquire
after
you
for
the
kellwitzes
and
he
stared
hard
at
me
i
can
tell
you
i
didn
t
know
his
name
till
farningham
told
me
it
seems
he
s
been
in
australia
for
a
little
time
and
he
has
been
a
good
deal
off
colour
too
in
berlin
he
went
to
vienna
last
week
to
see
a
chum
of
his
who
is
making
a
great
noise
with
some
operations
on
eyes
so
farningham
told
me
it
was
lucky
the
farninghams
came
here
a
few
days
after
i
got
back
from
london
i
ve
gone
about
with
him
a
good
deal
and
with
dick
and
his
brother
name
isn
t
it
comes
of
three
brothers
being
at
a
public
school
together
now
why
do
you
suppose
dick
left
me
in
the
lurch
like
that
he
told
me
plump
it
was
because
he
saw
an
old
of
a
girl
he
s
sweet
on
coming
our
way
and
he
couldn
t
afford
to
be
seen
with
the
little
frenchies
a
married
man
said
he
with
no
end
of
tin
can
stand
any
racket
but
a
penniless
attaché
has
to
be
deuced
proper
when
on
parade
wasn
t
that
a
friendly
trick
to
play
a
fellow
but
he
and
minimus
are
awful
fun
sometimes
minimus
is
supposed
to
be
studying
oriental
languages
for
a
diplomatic
career
in
india
people
teach
languages
so
much
better
in
germany
he
says
and
he
goes
once
a
month
perhaps
to
an
old
chap
who
swears
at
him
because
he
is
an
idle
young
dog
and
makes
an
appointment
with
him
to
come
next
week
to
learn
some
alphabet
but
min
doesn
t
as
a
rule
turn
up
he
says
i
d
better
give
him
a
billet
on
my
run
he
thinks
it
would
be
much
jollier
than
spoiling
his
eyes
over
rubbishy
eastern
i
ve
often
been
more
miserable
than
a
tuckerless
dingo
but
still
i
went
to
theatres
and
things
i
couldn
t
nurse
you
stella
you
see
of
course
not
it
was
much
better
you
should
go
but
now
i
can
look
after
you
a
bit
stella
and
that
little
george
she
s
worth
her
weight
in
gold
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
in
response
to
ritchie
s
robust
invitation
to
come
in
a
fair
man
entered
slight
and
rather
under
the
middle
height
are
you
allowed
to
see
people
so
early
in
the
day
ritchie
why
this
is
quite
the
an
open
fireplace
i
declare
yes
and
the
three
inexorable
of
night
and
the
business
farningham
said
ted
with
a
dignified
wave
of
his
hand
towards
the
tiles
why
ritchie
old
fellow
you
re
coming
it
strong
with
the
classics
do
tell
that
to
miss
caroline
sendler
you
must
know
ritchie
that
your
husband
is
carrying
on
a
barefaced
flirtation
with
an
elderly
lady
from
related
to
me
in
some
mystical
way
i
remember
she
s
your
wife
s
don
t
my
dear
fellow
let
it
remain
with
the
dark
riddles
of
a
world
not
realized
you
are
really
making
progress
now
ritchie
oh
yes
thank
you
i
quite
know
the
people
from
the
and
do
you
eat
anything
because
i
have
heard
dreadful
tales
on
that
now
stella
tell
the
truth
yesterday
you
looked
at
the
thigh
of
a
pigeon
and
said
oh
take
it
looks
so
dreadfully
pathetic
and
that
was
your
dinner
yes
upon
my
honour
farningham
i
had
to
take
it
away
and
a
little
while
afterwards
when
s
her
name
the
nurse
you
know
in
with
a
little
soup
signora
here
said
without
blinking
but
i
ve
had
dinner
you
know
ah
but
that
sort
of
thing
will
never
do
my
wife
declares
she
ate
all
day
when
she
was
getting
well
and
that
reminds
me
why
i
came
now
you
really
wound
me
i
thought
it
was
to
find
out
whether
i
ate
anything
said
stella
with
a
little
of
her
old
sprightliness
so
it
was
but
merely
to
knock
at
the
door
and
inquire
and
then
ask
if
my
wife
might
come
but
this
young
man
was
too
lazy
to
open
the
door
as
fräulein
hennig
does
and
you
look
so
jolly
and
cosy
one
can
t
tear
one
s
self
away
now
i
know
why
amalie
and
i
have
given
up
being
domesticated
it
s
the
absence
of
an
open
fireplace
at
this
juncture
another
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
which
was
speedily
opened
may
i
come
in
said
a
woman
s
voice
it
was
farningbam
a
tall
graceful
woman
with
dark
eyes
and
hair
a
clear
pale
skin
a
delicately
aquiline
nose
and
an
exquisitely
chiselled
mouth
in
feature
there
was
a
strong
resemblance
between
her
and
langdale
and
also
at
times
in
expression
ah
you
are
really
better
this
morning
she
said
taking
stella
s
hand
and
giving
ted
a
friendly
nod
i
was
on
the
eve
of
coming
to
tell
you
said
her
husband
but
i
suppose
i
d
better
stay
a
little
longer
and
then
our
family
circle
will
be
completed
by
the
babies
branches
you
d
better
send
me
away
ritchie
for
i
assure
you
there
is
absolutely
no
end
to
us
and
will
you
forgive
me
if
i
carry
your
husband
off
i
am
always
hiring
or
buying
or
exchanging
horses
and
i
always
get
choused
he
says
if
i
am
alone
hadn
t
i
better
take
dustiefoot
for
a
run
stella
lose
him
that
s
more
than
my
place
is
worth
you
may
be
sure
i
won
t
come
back
without
him
out
boy
out
but
though
dustiefoot
rose
up
with
alacrity
at
the
sound
he
got
no
farther
than
the
door
till
he
ran
back
and
put
his
head
on
his
mistress
s
lap
looking
up
fondly
into
her
face
out
said
stella
and
on
this
the
dog
trotted
away
when
the
two
men
were
gone
farningham
drew
her
chair
nearer
stella
s
saying
how
did
you
sleep
last
night
dear
tolerably
well
thank
you
for
two
or
three
and
after
that
oh
then
it
was
the
old
stupid
story
endless
processions
of
people
filing
by
as
if
i
were
a
mummy
holding
a
and
that
chamber
into
which
you
dare
not
it
still
remain
yes
and
myriads
of
voices
high
and
low
telling
me
to
pass
they
get
fainter
night
by
night
now
when
i
waken
up
in
the
soft
light
and
see
fräulein
hennig
s
quiet
face
i
do
not
any
longer
feel
like
a
terrified
child
that
covers
its
head
and
trembles
because
of
ghost
stories
it
has
ah
that
is
a
great
stage
this
is
your
first
serious
illness
for
the
first
time
you
know
something
of
the
terror
of
demoralized
nerves
but
now
that
you
begin
to
regain
tranquillity
the
worst
is
do
you
think
so
i
am
glad
to
feel
so
unmoved
but
hardly
know
frightens
me
a
little
that
all
which
used
to
be
so
much
to
me
seems
so
incredibly
oh
that
is
merely
brain
exhaustion
as
you
get
you
are
built
up
to
use
seemann
a
old
interests
will
li
farningham
s
prediction
was
unfortunately
not
verified
stella
s
strength
slowly
returned
but
her
mental
condition
remained
much
the
same
as
the
weeks
went
on
she
became
if
anything
more
silent
more
apathetic
the
first
event
that
roused
her
had
also
the
effect
of
bringing
on
a
feverish
attack
it
was
a
great
concert
given
in
the
philharmonic
hall
in
bernburger
strasse
the
conductor
and
violin
soloist
were
the
first
of
germany
supported
by
the
full
strength
of
the
philharmonic
orchestra
but
what
made
this
concert
especially
interesting
was
that
a
sinfonische
dichtung
the
composition
of
an
italian
musician
was
to
be
rendered
for
the
first
music
being
in
fact
still
unpublished
the
theme
is
taken
from
the
divine
it
is
the
of
francesca
polenta
named
da
rimini
and
of
paolo
malatesta
it
begins
in
the
second
circle
of
hell
guarded
by
minos
who
at
the
entrance
weighs
each
transgression
and
fixes
the
grade
to
which
the
spirit
shall
be
thrust
deep
slow
mysterious
waves
of
music
thrilled
the
mind
with
a
sudden
apprehension
of
the
gloom
unpenetrated
by
the
faintest
ray
of
light
then
very
slowly
there
rose
as
if
in
the
far
distance
the
howling
of
that
terrible
storm
of
fierce
and
wild
and
discordant
as
if
the
sea
were
riven
into
mountains
and
abysmal
depths
by
two
opposing
tempests
and
high
above
all
the
cries
of
lost
souls
after
the
storm
of
the
elements
and
of
tortured
souls
falls
shudderingly
into
silence
the
compassionate
voice
of
the
poet
arises
as
he
asks
the
two
who
clung
together
even
in
hell
itself
o
anime
affannate
venite
a
noi
parlar
s
altri
vol
niega
o
ye
tired
souls
come
speak
to
us
if
no
one
doth
forbid
then
came
the
low
anguished
wailing
sound
of
a
woman
s
voice
telling
her
sinful
in
eternal
torment
no
sound
in
life
or
nature
can
surely
ever
reproduce
the
piercing
pathos
of
a
human
voice
in
hopeless
misery
like
the
violin
under
the
touch
of
a
great
master
there
is
no
deeper
sorrow
than
to
recall
in
misery
a
happy
there
were
many
eyes
dimmed
among
the
audience
when
the
confession
was
translated
into
passionate
shuddering
music
the
symphony
from
beginning
to
end
made
a
strange
impression
upon
stella
and
as
in
the
leading
theme
the
musician
had
cunningly
woven
the
story
of
lancelot
whose
love
too
skilfully
told
by
the
old
romancer
had
been
such
dangerous
reading
so
through
all
the
storm
of
darkness
and
despair
through
the
inexorable
remembrance
of
an
hour
when
overmastering
passion
trampled
duty
under
foot
stella
was
conscious
of
piercing
recollections
rising
in
her
brain
which
since
her
illness
had
no
more
power
to
move
her
than
if
they
were
idle
spiders
strings
but
now
they
were
aflame
with
vivid
terrible
life
that
woman
s
voice
pleading
broken
despairing
arose
in
fitful
tones
making
the
blood
start
vehemently
in
her
her
shrink
and
tremble
like
a
creature
upon
whom
suddenly
a
great
burden
has
been
laid
it
has
been
too
much
for
you
whispered
farningham
let
me
take
you
home
now
yes
i
really
want
to
leave
before
anything
else
drives
away
the
memory
of
that
night
stella
woke
weeping
bitterly
in
her
dreams
by
night
she
had
been
listening
over
again
to
the
hopeless
wailing
story
told
by
francesca
to
dante
for
days
afterwards
the
fever
burned
in
her
veins
and
when
this
passed
away
she
began
to
avoid
shrink
from
meeting
them
she
began
to
walk
out
a
little
but
she
preferred
to
go
alone
to
the
thiergarten
with
only
dustiefoot
as
a
companion
even
maisie
s
presence
seemed
a
trouble
to
her
when
she
was
with
others
she
had
the
air
of
one
trying
unsuccessfully
to
understand
what
was
going
on
around
her
she
sometimes
fell
asleep
in
the
daytime
and
seemed
to
wander
for
years
in
a
strange
dark
land
beset
with
vague
shapes
of
dread
and
then
woke
up
with
a
start
to
find
her
momentary
slumbers
had
not
been
noticed
she
began
to
confound
events
with
visions
of
the
night
things
that
had
been
said
or
done
in
the
morning
would
seem
at
nightfall
to
be
separated
from
her
by
vast
tracts
of
time
she
began
to
have
a
dread
that
she
could
not
grasp
what
people
said
to
her
one
forenoon
as
she
was
alone
in
the
thiergarten
near
the
great
monument
of
the
nation
s
victory
over
france
she
suddenly
met
professor
and
kellwitz
she
looked
so
timid
and
so
seeing
them
that
kellwitz
s
motherly
heart
was
wrung
with
a
sudden
dread
she
knew
that
farningham
her
and
ritchie
had
gone
to
homburg
together
for
a
week
yet
no
one
who
knew
the
position
of
affairs
could
charge
ted
with
neglect
he
was
simply
like
one
who
looked
on
helpless
and
perplexed
he
was
always
ready
at
stella
s
command
but
she
had
none
to
give
he
was
anxious
to
take
her
anywhere
and
everywhere
but
she
had
no
wishes
except
to
be
left
alone
even
a
man
more
gifted
with
insight
and
with
resources
in
himself
than
ted
had
ever
been
might
be
excused
for
taking
refuge
in
the
companionship
and
recreations
that
were
open
to
him
he
was
in
a
foreign
land
with
no
occupation
beyond
amusing
himself
and
though
this
is
a
position
that
tests
the
calibre
of
minds
more
strongly
fortified
against
the
baser
temptations
of
life
yet
to
one
who
observed
ritchie
closely
at
this
time
it
would
become
apparent
that
the
excesses
into
which
he
had
earlier
fallen
were
due
less
to
inherent
weakness
than
to
that
nemesis
power
which
nature
often
puts
forth
when
but
a
small
part
of
man
s
faculties
are
touched
by
his
daily
life
at
this
time
also
farningham
was
much
engaged
among
the
poor
she
had
endeavoured
but
unsuccessfully
to
lead
stella
to
resume
her
interest
in
those
she
had
befriended
but
though
she
gave
money
lavishly
herself
she
would
not
give
she
had
become
conscious
of
some
imminent
danger
that
threatened
to
engulf
her
she
avoided
contact
with
all
that
might
arouse
her
the
chief
aim
that
swayed
her
at
this
time
was
to
spare
herself
shirk
those
stormy
depths
in
her
nature
which
threatened
ever
and
anon
to
surge
up
and
bear
her
she
knew
not
whither
but
on
this
day
kellwitz
struck
with
a
sudden
fear
would
listen
to
no
excuses
you
must
come
home
with
me
she
said
decisively
and
then
when
they
reached
the
house
she
sent
a
messenger
for
maisie
and
to
tell
the
baroness
that
ritchie
was
to
be
her
guest
for
a
few
days
to
come
during
the
day
she
talked
to
stella
of
many
books
and
pictures
and
music
once
only
the
girl
showed
a
dawning
interest
a
little
tremor
of
emotion
and
that
was
when
the
italian
composer
s
sinfonische
dichtung
was
named
towards
evening
kellwitz
made
her
lie
down
to
rest
in
her
own
cosy
after
a
little
she
fell
fast
asleep
and
the
wide
dark
circles
round
the
eyes
the
noble
sweep
of
the
brow
the
thin
outlines
of
the
cheeks
and
the
lines
round
the
mouth
all
bore
the
stamp
of
mental
languor
of
pain
temporarily
at
bay
but
not
vanquished
kellwitz
softly
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
a
few
minutes
afterwards
her
son
anselm
came
home
he
also
was
much
changed
his
face
had
in
the
last
few
months
grown
grave
and
stern
in
repose
through
his
stepfather
s
intimacy
with
seemann
anselm
knew
the
various
phases
of
stella
s
dangerous
illness
he
knew
that
latterly
the
physician
was
puzzled
at
the
mental
rigidity
which
had
fallen
on
her
he
had
often
seen
her
at
a
little
distance
when
she
walked
in
the
thiergarten
and
had
kept
aloof
for
fear
of
causing
her
pain
while
she
was
still
weak
and
also
because
of
the
cruel
perplexity
which
entangled
their
further
meeting
once
indeed
dustiefoot
nearly
betrayed
him
as
he
sat
at
a
little
distance
from
the
bench
on
which
stella
book
in
her
hand
but
not
reading
the
dog
recognised
anselm
and
rushed
up
to
him
with
signs
of
delight
which
he
would
never
have
bestowed
on
a
stranger
he
even
rushed
backwards
and
forwards
between
the
two
in
a
joyous
way
as
if
anxious
to
tell
his
mistress
that
an
old
lullaboolagana
friend
was
near
but
she
did
not
heed
dustiefoot
s
movements
she
sat
pale
and
motionless
with
downcast
eyes
oblivious
to
all
around
her
the
sight
was
more
than
langdale
could
bear
he
would
have
laid
down
his
life
to
serve
her
and
yet
he
dared
not
speak
to
her
being
in
fear
lest
his
face
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
would
do
her
harm
and
not
good
he
suffered
horribly
yet
he
knew
that
hers
was
the
more
intolerable
burden
for
through
all
he
had
work
to
do
and
he
was
in
constant
intercourse
with
people
whose
knowledge
in
some
one
direction
exceeded
his
which
serve
to
make
life
coherent
to
the
lover
of
knowledge
even
when
it
has
lost
its
best
savour
when
he
came
in
his
mother
observed
with
concern
that
the
fagged
strained
look
with
which
she
had
been
struck
on
first
seeing
him
when
she
returned
with
her
daughter
from
dresden
had
deepened
rather
than
become
less
you
are
working
too
hard
anselm
she
said
looking
at
him
keenly
you
are
as
greedy
as
ever
after
knowledge
those
lectures
of
virchow
at
the
university
and
the
honorary
work
at
the
hospital
and
your
writing
and
all
the
rest
of
it
do
not
make
much
of
a
you
forget
mother
that
i
had
a
long
oh
in
australia
i
hope
you
don
t
think
of
going
back
there
i
think
there
must
be
something
insidious
in
the
that
undermines
the
constitution
there
is
that
young
lady
the
professor
met
there
and
found
so
charming
you
met
her
here
did
you
not
ritchie
you
of
her
well
i
should
very
much
like
to
have
your
opinion
of
her
i
have
made
her
come
here
for
a
few
days
she
is
sleeping
just
now
i
am
exceedingly
afraid
that
there
is
something
very
much
langdale
felt
a
terror
of
what
fresh
catastrophe
might
be
in
store
the
fixed
look
in
stella
s
face
the
last
time
he
saw
her
at
a
little
distance
had
haunted
him
night
and
day
there
is
always
a
shock
in
hearing
our
worst
fears
put
into
bald
uncompromising
words
this
langdale
experienced
when
his
mother
went
on
it
is
not
her
body
now
it
is
her
mind
i
am
sure
of
that
perhaps
she
would
have
more
confidence
in
an
english
doctor
if
you
would
see
her
here
in
an
informal
and
your
stepfather
were
so
friendly
and
amalie
too
is
very
fond
of
her
i
hardly
know
what
to
think
of
her
husband
amalie
says
he
is
devoted
to
if
that
is
the
case
she
can
not
be
devoted
to
him
there
must
be
something
very
much
amiss
when
two
young
people
drift
so
far
apart
at
a
time
like
poor
langdale
few
situations
could
have
been
more
ironical
in
a
quiet
unaggressive
way
than
to
sit
listening
to
his
mother
while
she
calmly
discussed
the
situation
which
was
the
very
core
of
the
keenest
sorrows
and
interests
in
his
life
so
far
nothing
could
have
been
gained
by
taking
his
mother
or
sister
into
his
confidence
as
to
the
relations
which
had
at
one
time
existed
between
himself
and
stella
and
the
treachery
that
had
come
between
them
but
he
was
prepared
at
any
moment
to
tell
them
all
and
to
seek
their
help
in
somehow
averting
that
darkest
of
all
misfortunes
which
seemed
stealthily
creeping
nearer
in
the
meantime
he
kept
silence
he
absented
himself
from
home
that
evening
next
morning
he
saw
stella
alone
in
the
library
which
had
witnessed
their
first
strange
meeting
in
the
old
world
lii
she
knew
he
had
returned
from
vienna
some
weeks
previously
and
she
was
in
a
manner
prepared
to
see
him
in
his
mother
s
house
yet
when
they
stood
face
to
face
something
akin
to
fear
was
visible
in
her
manner
otherwise
he
was
more
agitated
than
she
was
they
touched
each
other
s
hands
and
then
they
sat
facing
each
other
in
a
silence
full
of
memories
stella
was
the
first
to
speak
you
have
been
away
i
think
she
said
without
looking
at
him
he
told
her
something
of
his
journey
of
his
old
friend
max
and
his
rising
renown
as
an
oculist
he
noticed
that
her
attention
wandered
and
that
she
kept
nervously
playing
with
her
which
hung
looser
than
ever
on
her
finger
there
was
a
pause
yes
it
must
have
been
very
interesting
she
said
looking
remark
that
had
no
direct
relation
to
what
he
had
last
said
something
clutched
at
his
throat
and
gave
him
a
horrible
choking
sensation
she
looked
into
his
face
fixedly
don
t
t
say
anything
i
can
not
bear
it
you
do
not
know
i
can
bear
to
speak
to
you
now
because
everything
is
all
over
and
done
with
but
there
are
times
you
do
not
she
spoke
in
a
low
imploring
voice
and
then
suddenly
broke
off
what
do
i
not
know
stella
he
said
mastering
himself
with
a
violent
effort
and
speaking
in
a
calm
unmoved
tone
oh
it
would
be
stupid
to
tell
you
let
us
talk
of
something
weather
for
this
little
attempt
at
recovering
something
of
her
old
gaiety
smote
him
to
the
heart
no
i
can
not
talk
of
anything
else
stella
i
want
you
to
speak
to
me
of
yourself
you
know
in
the
old
days
we
agreed
to
be
friends
we
can
at
least
be
yes
yes
we
can
be
friends
she
said
and
then
she
suddenly
began
to
sob
he
kept
perfectly
silent
when
she
had
recovered
composure
he
went
on
in
the
same
calm
voice
as
before
you
know
stella
friends
should
help
one
another
i
think
there
is
something
you
dread
tell
me
what
it
is
i
may
be
able
to
help
are
you
afraid
too
she
said
quickly
he
did
not
reply
immediately
he
felt
like
one
groping
in
the
dark
afraid
to
move
too
quickly
lest
harm
should
be
done
then
she
added
hesitatingly
i
have
been
afraid
for
some
time
the
voices
and
the
faces
have
gone
away
but
there
is
a
silence
coming
round
me
and
every
day
i
am
more
abyss
between
me
and
everyone
that
none
can
no
no
stella
not
so
how
many
care
for
you
but
i
can
not
care
for
in
the
old
way
there
is
a
strange
vacancy
an
apathy
it
comes
creeping
creeping
it
is
like
the
tide
rising
round
a
ship
that
has
been
stranded
o
my
god
it
is
is
horrible
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
as
he
looked
at
her
in
tearless
agony
he
trembled
as
if
in
an
ague
fit
do
you
know
what
i
keep
thinking
of
sometimes
she
said
suddenly
looking
up
of
some
old
story
in
ovid
where
one
says
give
me
your
hand
before
i
am
a
serpent
all
over
those
old
stories
where
people
were
turned
into
birds
and
trees
and
reptiles
they
are
not
so
terrible
some
other
no
they
are
not
only
when
we
see
a
great
danger
the
very
fact
that
we
see
it
shows
we
may
try
to
avoid
his
voice
almost
failed
him
once
or
twice
for
there
was
something
in
her
tone
and
manner
even
more
than
in
her
words
which
confirmed
his
worst
fears
you
still
keep
up
your
old
habit
of
taking
a
book
with
you
when
you
go
out
he
said
presently
in
a
lighter
tone
yes
but
i
can
not
read
is
it
not
strange
she
said
looking
at
him
with
eyes
ah
these
times
come
to
one
he
answered
now
i
am
going
to
tell
you
something
about
i
oh
of
course
she
said
with
more
animation
than
she
had
yet
shown
well
i
have
finished
that
treatise
i
was
writing
at
the
conditions
of
factory
labour
there
is
some
other
work
i
want
to
do
and
besides
i
have
gone
quite
blunt
over
the
thing
the
facts
and
i
believe
their
inferences
are
correct
but
the
style
i
am
sure
is
odious
now
will
you
go
over
the
for
me
it
was
some
little
time
before
she
spoke
and
then
it
was
in
a
hesitating
broken
way
which
was
quite
foreign
to
her
old
quick
spontaneous
manner
i
would
be
so
glad
to
do
it
but
i
lose
things
so
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
is
as
hardly
know
how
to
explain
if
i
came
on
blank
spaces
in
my
mind
words
and
thoughts
drop
away
out
of
reach
quite
suddenly
i
am
almost
afraid
to
speak
to
people
lest
i
might
not
know
what
they
say
i
was
afraid
even
of
you
and
yet
how
kind
you
have
always
that
one
letter
but
it
was
because
it
was
the
other
one
i
never
got
no
i
never
got
but
about
this
work
i
want
you
to
do
for
me
stella
he
answered
the
clear
harmonious
intonations
of
his
voice
were
lost
in
a
constrained
huskiness
but
though
his
heart
was
throbbing
wildly
with
fierce
and
contending
emotions
his
was
outwardly
unbroken
it
is
very
important
i
should
get
the
help
of
some
friend
and
there
is
no
one
whose
aid
i
care
to
ask
but
yours
it
does
not
in
the
least
matter
about
your
taking
a
long
while
over
it
do
only
a
page
or
two
at
a
i
will
try
to
do
it
but
i
will
not
let
anyone
see
it
for
fear
it
may
be
wrong
i
will
try
not
to
make
mistakes
but
i
do
not
know
it
is
what
you
were
writing
at
lullaboolagana
yes
and
there
is
one
thing
more
i
am
going
to
ask
you
there
is
a
convalescent
home
for
little
children
on
the
northern
outskirts
of
the
town
my
mother
knows
it
will
you
let
her
take
you
there
oh
they
will
be
pale
and
miserable
they
will
hurt
me
and
when
things
hurt
me
ah
you
do
not
know
how
dreadful
it
is
and
a
look
of
helpless
fear
came
into
her
face
which
pierced
him
like
a
sword
before
he
could
trust
himself
to
answer
this
objection
she
went
on
sometimes
speaking
in
a
low
hurried
voice
at
others
very
slowly
with
a
curious
hesitation
as
if
the
words
she
sought
eluded
her
while
often
she
used
terms
that
but
approximately
expressed
what
she
meant
sometimes
at
night
i
keep
thinking
of
a
poor
welshwoman
who
used
to
wander
about
some
years
ago
she
had
a
great
dislike
to
staying
in
houses
she
always
said
there
were
adders
in
them
she
was
not
badly
hurt
in
her
mind
you
know
that
she
ought
to
be
locked
up
you
know
anselm
it
is
true
when
people
lose
they
forget
the
meaning
of
all
around
are
locked
away
like
the
dead
only
they
are
not
quite
like
the
dead
johanna
that
was
her
name
sometimes
she
came
to
fairacre
and
mother
and
kirsty
were
very
kind
to
she
broke
off
abruptly
and
gave
a
long
shuddering
sigh
ah
after
all
you
have
never
been
at
fairacre
she
said
fixing
her
great
mournful
eyes
on
his
face
after
a
pause
it
was
near
the
the
scarlet
fairy
roses
grew
i
was
to
wear
the
day
you
came
when
the
reached
port
you
always
liked
me
to
wear
roses
and
when
i
flew
up
to
meet
you
a
bird
began
to
sing
as
if
it
were
wild
with
joy
have
i
hurt
you
she
said
falteringly
as
he
rose
and
turned
away
abruptly
his
lips
trembling
and
ashy
pale
he
could
not
speak
she
stole
up
to
him
with
a
frightened
air
and
looking
into
his
face
she
saw
that
his
eyes
were
wet
she
gave
a
little
low
moan
and
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
anselm
what
can
i
say
to
make
you
glad
you
were
always
so
serene
end
hopeful
do
you
remember
what
i
said
when
i
sent
you
those
dreadful
letters
that
have
been
burnt
into
my
brain
did
i
dream
it
i
shall
do
what
you
think
is
right
i
am
not
dreaming
now
he
turned
quickly
raising
his
hands
to
draw
her
to
him
but
with
a
strong
effort
he
resisted
the
impulse
he
noticed
that
since
she
began
to
speak
to
him
something
of
the
tension
in
her
face
had
relaxed
tell
me
about
this
poor
woman
stella
who
used
to
come
to
fairacre
he
said
in
as
calm
a
voice
as
was
possible
to
him
about
johanna
the
last
time
she
came
she
was
very
strange
she
said
that
when
she
stayed
inside
speckled
adders
crawled
round
her
at
night
saying
drown
yourself
there
are
three
under
the
table
now
that
was
what
she
said
and
then
mother
tried
to
soothe
her
she
said
if
they
were
there
we
would
see
them
but
johanna
laughed
it
was
such
a
a
shrill
laugh
i
laughed
like
her
the
other
night
and
it
sounded
horrible
in
the
silence
poor
dustiefoot
was
frightened
he
began
to
growl
at
my
door
he
lies
on
the
mat
outside
you
are
not
angry
with
me
are
you
she
looked
in
his
face
with
confused
timidity
ah
no
stella
why
should
i
be
he
said
in
a
choked
voice
she
passed
her
hand
wearily
over
her
eyes
well
i
have
not
finished
there
is
some
reason
why
i
began
to
tell
you
ah
it
was
about
poor
johanna
yes
she
laughed
and
said
the
adders
wouldn
t
let
anyone
like
mother
see
them
they
were
no
fools
does
it
not
say
in
the
word
of
god
be
ye
wise
as
serpents
that
was
what
she
said
the
way
they
all
came
staring
at
me
she
said
you
see
adders
have
a
great
advantage
over
us
in
that
way
ma
am
having
no
eyelashes
if
i
prayed
at
all
i
think
i
would
pray
that
these
beasties
might
be
kept
from
me
then
mother
held
her
hand
and
said
but
you
do
still
pray
i
hope
well
no
ma
am
she
said
not
lately
you
see
there
s
some
that
the
lord
lets
off
his
hands
altogether
if
they
pray
he
turns
a
deaf
ear
to
them
if
they
are
in
want
or
sickness
he
gives
them
no
wine
or
mead
out
of
a
crystal
cup
she
did
drown
herself
at
last
she
ended
in
an
tone
looking
into
anselm
s
face
with
startled
eyes
yes
but
about
the
convalescent
children
he
said
gently
oh
i
know
now
why
i
told
you
about
this
poor
woman
she
answered
quickly
i
am
terrified
of
being
hurt
because
when
i
am
as
i
was
so
badly
with
the
music
at
the
philharmonic
hall
think
it
would
be
so
much
be
quite
at
rest
some
days
ago
i
walked
by
the
she
suddenly
stopped
a
look
in
her
face
you
have
been
awake
very
much
of
late
stella
he
said
betraying
no
sign
of
anguish
save
in
the
constrained
accents
of
his
voice
yes
but
that
is
better
than
to
be
made
to
sleep
often
when
i
am
asleep
everything
i
touch
falls
in
crumbles
away
then
i
dream
something
dreadful
has
happened
and
i
am
glad
to
wake
but
when
i
am
wide
awake
it
is
much
any
dream
but
stella
these
children
are
not
miserable
and
wretched
it
is
not
a
great
hospital
there
are
never
more
than
fourteen
it
is
a
private
place
founded
by
seven
mother
is
one
of
children
who
have
all
but
recovered
from
illness
the
greatest
joy
you
could
give
them
would
be
to
tell
them
a
little
australian
story
or
take
them
out
for
a
drive
in
the
country
two
or
three
at
a
time
my
mother
and
i
took
four
of
them
up
to
treptow
the
other
day
it
is
on
the
river
and
there
is
a
large
quite
close
to
the
spree
they
sat
by
the
window
eating
cakes
and
seeing
the
boats
and
barges
sail
by
and
then
we
went
out
into
the
wood
behind
treptow
and
every
little
weed
they
saw
gave
them
joy
you
have
plenty
of
plenty
of
time
she
repeated
vacantly
and
then
a
little
afterwards
as
if
the
meaning
of
the
words
had
gradually
dawned
on
her
there
is
endless
it
is
all
empty
and
terrible
and
full
of
crumbling
things
i
like
to
go
outside
because
i
feel
as
if
i
were
then
away
from
the
dreadful
corridor
you
do
not
know
what
i
mean
by
no
but
you
can
explain
it
to
me
his
calm
even
voice
seemed
to
allay
her
rising
agitation
she
passed
her
hand
slowly
over
her
brow
before
answering
you
know
for
weeks
back
when
i
try
to
read
or
write
or
even
it
is
i
try
to
do
slips
away
from
me
even
when
people
talk
round
me
their
voices
go
a
long
way
off
and
then
i
am
in
a
wide
great
empty
corridor
where
my
footsteps
make
a
strange
sound
but
i
do
not
mind
that
it
is
the
long
dark
passages
that
wind
out
of
it
i
feel
as
if
i
were
dragged
along
them
against
my
will
and
at
the
end
there
are
great
cages
with
iron
bars
in
front
strong
iron
bars
for
there
are
wild
creatures
behind
she
looked
up
into
his
face
with
a
terror
in
her
eyes
that
made
the
perspiration
stand
out
in
cold
drops
on
his
forehead
dear
stella
do
not
think
of
them
he
said
in
a
low
imploring
voice
ah
but
you
do
not
are
not
savage
creatures
out
of
the
woods
they
are
human
are
women
some
of
them
but
they
beat
at
the
bars
and
shriek
to
get
out
when
i
hear
them
i
feel
as
if
i
must
shriek
too
they
are
must
be
kept
there
because
they
are
more
dangerous
than
wild
beasts
ah
my
god
how
they
terrify
me
i
keep
silent
i
say
nothing
of
all
this
because
people
would
be
afraid
of
me
as
i
am
of
these
cages
those
that
are
in
no
no
stella
that
is
only
how
people
feel
after
they
have
had
a
terrible
illness
like
yours
you
must
come
to
see
these
ah
the
children
they
have
been
you
are
nursing
them
back
to
life
cruel
that
is
often
they
might
have
died
while
the
world
seemed
still
beautiful
and
they
could
pray
to
god
our
father
who
art
in
heaven
hallowed
be
thy
name
think
what
it
is
anselm
to
outlive
all
know
that
there
is
no
father
in
there
are
people
who
must
be
put
into
iron
you
see
it
coming
nearer
every
terror
you
can
not
name
stella
stella
think
how
wrong
it
would
be
to
let
ourselves
sink
under
one
aspect
of
life
in
that
way
it
is
only
because
your
illness
still
hangs
about
you
that
you
can
have
such
strange
thoughts
if
these
children
were
neglected
now
when
their
parents
are
unable
to
care
for
them
properly
their
constitutions
might
be
for
life
it
is
not
that
they
would
most
creatures
having
once
gained
a
footing
in
the
world
make
up
their
minds
to
stay
if
possible
it
is
that
the
seeds
would
be
laid
for
lingering
for
madness
itself
that
is
what
you
can
do
to
save
some
people
from
the
wretchedness
of
lives
hopelessly
mutilated
by
disease
i
know
there
are
some
forms
of
misery
we
can
do
nothing
to
lessen
it
is
all
the
more
shame
to
us
if
we
do
not
help
in
things
within
our
there
was
a
little
touch
of
sternness
in
his
voice
it
hurt
him
to
assume
it
but
the
tone
seemed
to
bring
his
words
home
to
her
more
directly
you
wish
me
to
go
to
see
them
ah
you
think
i
can
speak
to
they
will
love
me
as
the
children
used
i
do
not
think
know
it
once
you
told
me
that
you
were
wilful
i
did
not
quite
believe
it
then
but
now
you
are
a
you
will
not
persist
now
let
me
tell
you
about
some
of
these
little
he
made
her
sit
in
a
large
armchair
and
placed
a
cushion
under
her
head
and
then
sat
on
a
low
chair
facing
her
and
told
her
one
or
two
of
those
commonplace
everyday
incidents
in
the
annals
of
the
poor
which
come
within
the
ken
of
all
who
visit
or
work
among
them
only
he
did
not
let
his
narrations
drop
into
monologues
he
put
them
in
a
way
that
made
her
ask
questions
that
roused
and
interested
her
the
last
child
he
spoke
of
was
a
little
one
named
gretchen
she
had
been
run
over
in
the
streets
taken
into
one
of
the
hospitals
and
discharged
while
still
very
weak
at
home
she
was
inadequately
fed
and
when
his
mother
found
out
about
her
a
tumour
had
formed
under
one
knee
which
threatened
to
cripple
her
for
life
this
had
been
removed
and
she
was
now
in
the
plump
merry
little
thing
who
gave
names
of
her
own
to
everyone
what
do
you
suppose
she
calls
me
stella
he
asked
she
smiled
one
who
knows
how
to
scold
sometimes
no
something
with
more
unconscious
irony
than
that
the
doctor
who
has
no
medicine
of
course
a
doctor
of
that
sort
is
all
the
more
welcome
to
greta
but
still
the
title
has
its
own
little
stroke
of
malice
when
one
knows
how
applicable
it
often
is
and
then
my
mother
has
a
distinctive
name
too
one
of
the
other
little
ones
said
one
day
enthusiastically
oh
she
is
an
angel
yes
she
is
answered
greta
an
angel
with
a
basket
the
matron
overheard
them
and
told
my
mother
who
is
very
proud
of
the
definition
for
after
all
as
she
says
how
much
better
it
is
to
have
a
basket
in
this
world
if
you
are
an
angel
than
a
pair
of
wings
yes
she
is
a
child
take
her
all
in
all
out
of
a
thousand
so
tender
and
bright
and
unselfish
she
has
the
gift
of
a
sunny
nature
and
yet
she
has
so
much
imagination
and
she
can
do
so
many
by
this
time
if
no
one
had
helped
her
she
would
be
either
dead
or
a
cripple
for
how
old
is
the
dear
little
thing
nine
last
month
my
mother
has
insisted
on
her
staying
a
few
more
weeks
so
that
she
may
be
quite
strong
she
is
knitting
a
pair
of
long
stockings
for
karl
a
younger
brother
he
is
so
good
and
strong
and
already
he
can
do
many
more
things
than
a
girl
she
told
me
quite
lately
i
asked
her
if
she
would
like
to
be
a
boy
and
after
meditating
a
little
she
said
no
why
i
said
because
the
dear
god
made
me
a
girl
she
answered
and
then
she
added
and
i
would
wear
out
my
boots
so
much
faster
i
must
go
to
see
greta
said
stella
smiling
yes
it
would
have
been
dreadful
if
her
health
had
been
spoiled
she
said
reflectively
after
a
little
pause
presently
kellwitz
came
in
knitting
and
when
stella
found
that
some
of
the
convalescent
children
were
badly
in
need
of
clothing
she
began
to
make
some
garments
which
kellwitz
cut
out
for
her
that
evening
when
she
bade
langdale
she
said
softly
i
am
not
going
to
be
wilful
i
will
do
what
you
he
stood
for
some
moments
motionless
while
the
quick
flush
that
had
risen
in
his
face
died
away
and
then
he
recalled
her
face
and
tones
during
their
early
interview
that
day
it
was
one
of
those
terrible
hours
which
all
through
a
lifetime
remain
in
the
memory
as
if
stamped
on
it
by
a
process
apart
from
ordinary
recollection
he
took
a
letter
out
of
his
that
he
had
received
on
the
preceding
day
from
tareling
he
had
written
to
her
through
a
lawyer
stating
that
he
had
possession
of
one
of
the
letters
he
had
left
in
her
hands
for
miss
stella
the
day
and
even
the
hour
one
had
been
mutilated
the
other
stolen
and
a
fraudulent
document
had
been
put
with
the
falsified
one
she
had
delivered
he
awaited
any
explanation
she
might
have
to
offer
before
putting
the
matter
into
the
hands
of
an
eminent
firm
of
melbourne
lawyers
for
prosecution
the
reply
was
an
abject
confession
of
course
it
was
quite
abject
confessions
extorted
by
fear
are
apt
to
be
it
was
her
overwhelming
love
for
her
only
adjective
only
twice
underlined
he
had
loved
stella
courtland
passionately
from
boyhood
she
had
at
one
time
favoured
his
suit
is
curious
to
notice
how
naturally
people
slip
into
this
kind
of
english
when
they
are
telling
lies
then
she
had
at
a
moment
s
caprice
rejected
him
the
effect
on
the
only
brother
was
terrible
but
still
he
had
ample
grounds
for
hope
then
came
miss
courtland
s
visit
to
lullaboolagana
her
return
to
monico
lodge
in
picturesque
english
came
a
graphic
description
of
the
terrible
temptation
to
remove
a
rival
from
her
brother
s
path
laurette
rose
to
the
occasion
she
spoke
in
such
exaggerated
accents
of
remorse
one
might
imagine
she
had
used
a
poisoned
bowl
yes
she
had
been
weak
and
erring
as
only
a
poor
foolish
woman
can
be
when
blinded
by
affection
etc
but
after
all
the
past
was
irrevocable
what
but
harm
could
come
of
stirring
up
strife
langdale
asked
himself
the
same
question
with
a
sinking
heart
here
were
full
and
clear
proofs
of
the
treachery
by
which
they
had
been
betrayed
but
what
could
any
exposure
of
this
base
crime
avail
it
meant
more
publicity
could
not
save
them
a
single
pang
nor
make
the
future
more
hopeful
nor
help
to
divert
the
doom
worse
than
death
with
which
he
saw
stella
threatened
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
his
sight
dimmed
a
dull
throbbing
in
his
temples
as
he
recalled
her
looks
and
tones
in
the
earlier
part
of
their
interview
i
will
do
what
you
his
heart
gave
a
leap
as
he
recalled
the
words
what
action
should
he
take
to
save
her
from
the
wild
dark
morass
into
which
her
life
had
been
turned
he
had
written
sending
his
letter
through
an
eminent
english
lawyer
on
the
morning
that
stella
forwarded
him
those
fatal
unsigned
cunningly
devised
to
support
the
lies
that
were
conveyed
by
the
fragments
diabolically
falsified
of
his
own
letter
with
the
purpose
of
extorting
an
admission
of
guilt
but
since
then
all
other
thoughts
had
been
lost
in
agonizing
anxiety
as
to
the
issue
of
stella
s
illness
that
had
passed
but
a
worse
calamity
threatened
her
could
he
not
save
her
could
he
not
stem
the
bitter
waters
that
had
swept
away
all
the
joy
and
pleasantness
of
her
life
and
now
menaced
reason
itself
he
had
resolved
to
urge
no
make
no
appeal
to
the
love
which
he
knew
was
still
the
strongest
emotion
that
swayed
any
weakness
of
shattered
health
clouded
or
warped
her
judgment
but
now
it
seemed
as
if
every
day
in
which
she
was
left
at
the
mercy
of
the
grief
and
dark
fear
that
had
lodged
in
her
mind
rendered
ultimate
recovery
more
doubtful
and
what
prospect
did
the
future
hold
for
her
was
not
the
slow
dull
contagion
of
this
union
so
fraudulently
compassed
a
greater
evil
than
any
alternative
that
lay
open
to
her
and
yet
to
a
proud
sensitive
man
whose
own
experience
of
life
had
been
early
dashed
with
a
woman
s
infidelity
how
unendurable
was
the
thought
of
any
stigma
cast
on
the
girl
whose
honour
was
more
sacred
to
him
than
aught
else
in
the
world
but
then
there
are
passages
in
life
of
so
vital
a
nature
that
they
must
be
judged
wholly
apart
from
the
common
ineffectual
criticism
of
common
minds
it
was
one
of
those
subtle
and
cruel
complications
in
human
lives
in
which
no
action
seems
possible
that
is
not
charged
with
evil
at
last
in
despair
he
told
himself
that
he
would
do
what
he
could
and
live
from
hand
to
mouth
for
the
present
make
no
plans
beyond
the
passing
as
far
as
lay
in
his
power
he
would
watch
over
and
shield
stella
from
to
guard
her
from
the
stealthy
foe
that
had
already
sapped
some
of
the
outworks
of
the
citadel
of
reason
next
morning
when
he
went
into
his
mother
s
he
found
the
two
in
cheerful
converse
stella
is
coming
with
me
to
our
convalescent
children
this
afternoon
his
mother
said
briskly
she
was
one
of
those
actively
kind
women
whose
mere
presence
throws
discredit
on
the
darker
evils
of
the
world
see
how
rapidly
the
child
sews
she
said
holding
up
a
small
garment
which
stella
had
already
completed
my
dear
it
is
fatal
when
i
find
that
people
can
work
like
this
i
am
always
turning
up
with
a
little
bundle
of
flannel
or
calico
to
be
made
into
small
petticoats
and
an
angel
with
a
basket
in
fact
mother
said
her
son
and
at
this
they
all
laughed
a
little
langdale
noted
with
a
thrill
of
gladness
that
something
of
the
old
look
of
vivid
life
had
come
back
into
stella
s
face
to
do
some
work
and
for
his
sake
because
he
wished
was
the
chord
that
had
been
struck
and
gave
a
quick
response
the
mere
fact
of
giving
expression
to
the
dread
that
had
so
long
passed
in
smother
and
begun
habitually
to
haunt
her
served
to
lessen
her
fears
after
this
stella
went
almost
daily
to
the
convalescent
children
and
daily
she
went
over
some
of
langdale
s
altering
a
word
here
and
there
now
and
then
putting
in
a
different
phrase
she
feared
at
first
to
trust
her
own
judgment
when
she
felt
inclined
to
make
changes
but
she
gained
confidence
as
she
went
on
and
then
something
of
the
fascination
of
of
that
preoccupation
with
ideas
which
takes
the
mind
out
of
itself
laid
hold
of
her
to
think
too
exclusively
of
ourselves
or
our
own
concerns
even
under
our
best
aspects
is
as
a
rule
to
become
sad
weary
and
discouraged
but
to
be
immured
in
such
thoughts
when
the
thrill
and
joy
of
life
are
gone
when
its
best
promises
are
mildewed
with
disillusion
and
disappointment
is
to
poison
the
very
source
of
sane
existence
and
healthy
endeavour
it
had
been
so
with
stella
and
in
the
lowest
deep
of
her
unhappiness
there
yet
opened
the
lower
deep
that
the
misery
which
had
overtaken
her
like
a
flood
was
so
largely
her
own
doing
yes
gradually
she
crept
back
from
the
gulf
that
had
threatened
to
close
over
her
the
little
ones
that
gathered
round
her
their
faces
lighting
up
with
pleasure
drew
her
to
them
from
day
to
day
and
then
they
would
shyly
ask
for
stories
of
strange
land
with
strange
birds
and
beasts
and
unknown
trees
that
never
lost
their
leaves
sometimes
she
would
write
out
beforehand
one
of
the
little
twilight
stories
she
had
told
at
lullaboolagana
so
that
she
might
not
hesitate
and
be
at
a
loss
for
words
when
her
little
audience
clustered
breathlessly
around
her
the
dear
lady
was
the
name
by
which
they
learned
to
call
her
and
then
it
began
to
be
spring
once
spring
of
a
northern
climate
when
nature
gradually
wakens
from
her
rigid
sleep
when
the
first
early
blossoms
and
the
first
returning
timid
evangels
of
quickening
the
air
with
messages
which
the
heart
understands
but
does
not
put
into
words
it
was
one
day
early
in
april
the
air
had
lost
its
barbarous
keenness
the
sun
shone
as
if
it
was
getting
warm
there
were
clouds
over
part
of
the
sky
but
between
them
a
wistful
azure
showed
itself
and
on
the
tall
slender
birch
in
the
thiergarten
that
was
opposite
stella
s
a
swallow
and
some
linnets
were
carolling
as
if
they
were
bent
on
being
marked
as
the
first
choristers
of
the
season
stella
had
returned
from
a
visit
to
one
of
the
museums
with
professor
kellwitz
and
sat
by
the
window
as
she
had
entered
in
her
sealskin
coat
and
toque
as
they
returned
they
met
langdale
and
he
accompanied
them
as
far
as
the
pension
eisengau
the
incident
had
brought
back
the
first
day
they
met
in
berlin
with
startling
distinctness
they
had
exchanged
few
words
beyond
the
ordinary
salutations
kellwitz
and
stella
were
often
together
but
she
and
langdale
met
seldomer
and
but
for
a
few
minutes
yet
these
accidental
brief
meetings
surrounded
the
day
on
which
they
took
place
with
an
aureole
stella
now
sat
with
lips
slightly
parted
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
looking
fixedly
before
her
with
a
dawning
sort
of
expression
ritchie
entered
at
that
moment
and
was
struck
with
the
air
of
vividness
in
her
face
why
stella
you
will
soon
be
quite
yourself
again
he
said
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
near
where
she
sat
the
colour
slowly
deepened
in
her
cheeks
and
she
took
off
her
toque
he
suddenly
stooped
over
her
and
touched
her
forehead
with
his
lips
she
started
as
if
she
were
stung
you
must
not
do
that
she
said
in
a
peremptory
tone
he
was
deeply
wounded
and
drew
back
looking
at
her
with
a
startled
expression
perhaps
i
had
better
not
come
into
the
same
you
are
in
he
said
in
a
rougher
voice
than
he
had
ever
used
to
her
before
a
look
of
cold
displeasure
settled
on
her
face
but
she
said
nothing
while
you
were
so
ill
he
went
on
in
a
gentler
tone
and
seemed
more
miserable
if
i
were
about
i
kept
out
of
the
way
then
as
you
got
better
you
were
kinder
to
me
you
sometimes
drove
out
with
me
and
let
me
do
things
for
you
but
now
again
you
hardly
speak
to
me
once
in
two
days
and
as
for
laughing
or
he
noticed
a
look
almost
akin
to
terror
creeping
into
her
face
and
stopped
abruptly
forgive
me
stella
if
i
have
been
rough
he
said
after
a
little
stella
had
rung
the
bell
and
when
maisie
came
in
she
gave
her
her
toque
and
coat
to
put
away
and
asked
for
her
before
she
returned
an
answer
to
ted
s
apology
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
and
farningham
came
in
now
this
is
fortunate
i
wanted
to
find
you
both
in
she
said
you
know
stella
that
my
mother
and
are
going
to
the
east
about
the
beginning
of
may
anselm
tells
me
that
johnny
s
lungs
need
special
care
well
i
mean
only
to
stay
in
england
till
the
beginning
of
june
i
will
then
join
my
mother
in
egypt
now
had
you
not
better
come
with
me
you
know
how
these
two
men
will
haunt
the
racecourses
from
dan
to
may
to
it
had
been
for
some
time
arranged
that
the
farninghams
and
ritchies
would
leave
berlin
together
the
two
men
were
anxious
to
be
in
england
through
the
racing
season
and
their
wives
who
were
neither
of
them
supremely
interested
in
the
turf
would
thus
bear
each
other
company
stella
became
very
pale
and
grave
well
i
think
that
would
be
far
the
best
arrangement
said
ritchie
but
stella
did
not
at
once
reply
you
see
they
could
join
us
in
palestine
or
egypt
as
soon
as
the
leger
or
whatever
the
last
races
they
wanted
to
see
were
over
went
on
farningham
she
watched
stella
a
little
curiously
and
seeing
the
anxious
perplexed
look
in
her
face
she
added
lightly
turning
to
ted
you
see
ritchie
your
wife
is
not
disposed
to
lose
sight
of
you
for
so
you
think
the
matter
and
with
that
she
left
the
two
alone
once
more
you
had
better
go
stella
said
ritchie
after
a
pause
i
do
not
know
she
answered
slowly
she
was
like
one
roughly
aroused
out
of
a
gentle
morning
dream
a
flood
of
conjectures
of
questions
poured
in
on
her
and
the
old
tormenting
habit
of
finding
the
train
of
thought
suddenly
swamped
reasserted
itself
but
one
conviction
was
clear
and
steady
if
she
and
ritchie
parted
she
would
never
come
back
to
him
again
he
poor
fellow
was
touched
thinking
her
hesitation
was
due
to
concern
at
the
prospect
of
leaving
him
to
his
own
devices
for
so
long
a
period
don
t
be
afraid
about
me
stella
he
said
i
made
a
promise
that
i
would
never
forget
myself
in
drink
again
and
i
don
t
mean
to
put
a
knife
in
the
contract
i
don
t
take
much
credit
to
myself
for
that
for
the
more
you
see
of
the
world
the
more
there
is
to
open
your
eyes
we
get
into
a
beastly
habit
of
drinking
spirits
in
australia
but
a
bottle
of
good
château
lafite
beats
such
stuff
hollow
you
sip
glass
after
glass
and
instead
of
getting
stupider
you
are
more
alive
and
then
stella
while
matters
are
as
they
are
between
us
it
s
easier
for
me
to
be
out
of
your
sight
you
see
if
farningham
and
i
are
in
england
till
the
end
of
september
why
the
year
would
be
up
by
the
time
i
came
is
it
isn
t
that
the
place
where
the
jews
used
to
play
up
so
before
they
discovered
the
christians
by
jove
you
should
hear
minimus
avenell
talk
about
the
hebrews
and
ted
laughed
at
sundry
reminiscences
somehow
the
sight
of
stella
so
perplexed
and
silent
at
the
prospect
of
parting
from
him
for
four
or
five
months
raised
his
spirits
liii
during
the
time
that
intervened
between
this
and
the
week
before
they
left
berlin
for
london
stella
remained
undecided
as
to
her
future
movements
letters
came
from
adelaide
and
lullaboolagana
full
of
tender
anxiety
regarding
her
health
ted
had
written
faithfully
week
by
week
while
she
was
unable
to
do
so
he
had
always
put
the
best
face
on
the
matter
and
when
finally
out
of
danger
he
had
cabled
the
news
now
letters
came
in
answer
to
the
first
short
notes
she
had
written
about
the
middle
of
february
there
was
so
much
rejoicing
over
her
loving
thankful
congratulations
they
were
so
secure
in
their
confidence
that
return
to
health
meant
love
and
happiness
and
safety
from
all
evil
the
entire
ignorance
as
to
her
real
life
of
all
who
were
dear
to
her
in
her
home
and
native
land
separated
stella
from
them
far
more
than
the
long
weeks
of
sailing
which
lay
between
is
there
anything
in
human
experience
more
strange
more
piercing
than
the
isolation
that
surrounds
most
of
us
during
the
darker
storms
that
rend
the
soul
how
unaccountable
how
incredible
how
strange
beyond
all
reckoning
we
say
when
some
event
wholly
unanticipated
happens
in
the
history
of
others
we
so
often
forget
that
the
inner
lives
of
even
those
who
are
most
closely
linked
to
ours
are
implacably
veiled
from
our
gaze
it
is
with
individual
as
with
national
life
outwardly
things
may
be
going
on
in
the
old
smooth
apparently
prosperous
fashion
we
do
not
see
the
inner
cone
in
which
a
little
speck
has
appeared
that
slowly
spreads
and
spreads
we
do
not
hear
the
tread
on
the
loom
where
the
shuttle
at
every
throw
is
weaving
the
inscrutable
web
of
circumstance
at
last
the
catastrophe
falls
heavily
brutally
without
comment
or
warning
and
then
being
powerless
to
do
any
good
we
draw
a
moral
its
ineptitude
as
a
rule
is
equalled
only
by
our
ignorance
of
the
real
forces
that
have
been
at
work
but
lost
undecided
and
unhappy
as
stella
had
again
become
the
old
vacant
apathy
did
not
return
she
worked
daily
and
those
daily
hours
in
which
so
much
of
her
own
personality
was
lost
in
thoughts
for
others
and
in
matters
apart
from
the
groove
of
her
own
life
saved
her
the
day
on
which
she
had
corrected
the
last
of
langdale
s
manuscript
she
met
him
in
farningham
s
in
the
pension
they
talked
chiefly
of
socialism
which
was
then
a
prominent
topic
among
those
who
were
inimical
or
favourable
to
the
movement
farningham
was
gradually
becoming
a
zealous
convert
after
all
she
said
at
the
close
of
a
spirited
controversy
between
herself
and
langdale
justice
is
never
done
to
the
poor
until
those
who
are
in
power
begin
to
be
terrified
these
bungling
attempts
at
state
socialism
are
valuable
as
a
tribute
to
the
power
that
lies
behind
our
kinsman
schiedlich
and
men
like
dear
old
gottfried
i
wish
he
had
not
joined
the
extreme
party
returned
langdale
it
seems
to
me
he
was
doing
such
good
work
when
he
was
writing
calmly
and
anselm
you
are
too
provokingly
amenable
to
reason
said
his
sister
interrupting
him
still
you
can
persuade
gottfried
when
no
one
else
can
move
him
i
wish
you
would
take
him
with
you
to
the
east
when
he
is
released
you
know
mother
is
never
so
happy
as
when
there
is
an
invalid
to
care
for
and
he
must
be
rather
broken
down
by
what
you
say
of
that
is
a
happy
thought
returned
langdale
i
shall
see
if
i
can
not
get
him
away
he
will
be
at
large
in
a
few
days
this
was
the
first
time
stella
heard
of
langdale
s
intention
to
go
to
the
east
and
as
she
listened
her
face
was
suddenly
suffused
with
colour
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
passed
as
if
enveloped
in
a
mist
farningham
made
stella
lie
down
and
placed
a
screen
round
the
couch
trusting
she
might
fall
asleep
but
she
could
not
rest
she
went
into
her
bedroom
dustiefoot
followed
her
and
tried
to
win
her
attention
but
she
did
not
notice
him
she
stood
before
a
wide
mirror
that
was
in
the
room
and
looked
at
her
own
face
in
it
steadily
till
she
caught
a
frightened
cowering
look
in
the
eyes
which
made
her
shrink
and
draw
back
the
unsteady
fiery
light
in
them
made
her
turn
deathly
pale
she
threw
herself
into
an
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
then
the
silence
became
intolerable
to
her
and
she
said
something
hardly
knew
what
the
tone
must
have
been
strange
for
the
dog
shrank
away
looking
at
her
timidly
oh
dustiefoot
dustiefoot
not
be
afraid
o
my
god
why
is
he
afraid
of
me
i
must
go
to
must
see
him
he
will
know
what
i
should
will
speak
to
me
then
she
broke
into
bitter
her
head
on
a
table
near
low
long
sobs
like
a
child
who
is
too
spent
to
weep
aloud
on
this
dustiefoot
came
up
and
put
his
head
on
her
lap
then
he
licked
her
hands
and
this
somehow
comforted
her
a
little
good
dog
good
dog
she
said
patting
him
on
the
head
the
tears
relieved
her
after
a
little
she
returned
to
her
friends
have
you
two
decided
how
long
you
are
to
be
in
england
asked
farningham
after
some
desultory
i
fear
ritchie
has
not
yet
made
up
her
mind
to
come
with
me
answered
farningham
you
had
better
go
stella
said
ted
yes
i
shall
go
she
answered
her
face
suddenly
flushing
this
decision
was
greeted
by
the
rest
with
warm
approval
liv
two
weeks
after
the
friends
went
to
london
farningham
s
delicate
boy
had
an
attack
of
hemorrhage
this
kept
her
indoors
very
much
and
altered
their
plans
it
was
arranged
that
she
and
stella
should
leave
for
alexandria
as
soon
as
the
boy
was
well
enough
to
travel
they
were
staying
in
the
westham
hotel
close
to
grosvenor
square
one
morning
a
week
before
they
purposed
leaving
stella
went
to
make
some
purchases
for
herself
and
farningham
not
once
after
the
evening
on
which
she
announced
her
intention
of
going
to
the
east
had
stella
wavered
in
her
decision
she
had
improved
rapidly
in
health
and
spirits
the
dark
shadow
that
had
for
a
time
hovered
over
her
had
disappeared
at
times
something
of
feverish
restlessness
took
possession
of
her
but
there
was
no
relapse
into
moody
melancholy
or
apathy
the
steady
unimpaired
health
which
naturally
belonged
to
her
was
once
more
though
it
was
past
the
middle
of
may
the
morning
was
dark
and
lowering
but
stella
was
oblivious
of
all
external
influences
ritchie
had
been
anxious
to
hire
a
brougham
for
her
daily
use
but
she
prevented
his
doing
so
she
said
she
saw
so
much
more
when
she
was
on
foot
and
all
her
old
love
of
walking
had
returned
she
had
an
abounding
sense
of
vigorous
life
that
made
physical
exertion
a
necessity
a
few
paces
away
from
the
hotel
she
met
langdale
on
his
way
there
will
you
please
take
dustiefoot
back
she
said
her
face
glowing
her
eyes
softly
lustrous
as
in
the
old
days
when
i
am
looking
at
things
he
puts
his
paws
on
the
counter
and
insists
on
looking
may
i
walk
a
little
way
with
you
he
asked
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
i
am
going
into
the
country
for
a
few
days
this
i
think
amalie
is
waiting
for
you
she
answered
her
boy
has
had
rather
a
restless
night
then
he
took
dustiefoot
back
as
she
wished
no
plans
nor
designs
had
been
formed
between
them
they
met
casually
now
and
then
and
talked
a
little
of
merely
impersonal
matters
nothing
more
but
each
was
conscious
that
the
one
step
which
was
to
shape
their
future
was
taken
when
stella
decided
to
go
to
the
east
in
those
days
she
struggled
no
longer
against
the
rising
joy
that
used
to
well
up
in
her
heart
at
the
prospect
of
cutting
herself
finally
adrift
from
the
future
that
had
been
woven
for
her
by
treachery
and
deceit
the
sweet
fascination
of
life
had
come
back
to
her
with
redoubled
force
on
this
morning
as
she
went
on
her
way
she
recalled
the
existence
she
had
led
for
the
past
few
months
with
something
of
wondering
contempt
she
had
been
terrified
at
the
past
oblivious
of
the
present
quailing
at
the
days
to
come
till
she
had
been
on
the
very
brink
of
madness
and
all
the
time
the
world
was
full
of
interest
and
movement
and
joy
was
there
no
lurking
consciousness
of
the
possibility
of
remorse
swallowing
up
this
intoxicating
recaptured
happiness
if
so
she
spurned
the
it
aside
like
one
of
those
malformed
little
insects
that
sometimes
crawl
on
the
petals
of
roses
she
was
glad
that
a
kind
of
pagan
recklessness
of
indifference
to
consequences
mingled
with
the
tide
of
her
courage
and
reviving
happiness
once
for
all
she
had
decided
that
the
problem
of
her
life
must
be
looked
at
as
it
was
in
be
solved
apart
from
authority
and
tradition
she
had
been
too
long
cowering
like
a
slave
afraid
of
of
most
of
all
of
nature
which
in
its
subtle
way
had
all
the
time
cherished
and
nursed
back
into
being
the
one
love
of
her
life
compared
to
which
all
other
bonds
were
but
as
flax
touched
with
flame
the
chalice
of
life
s
most
precious
benediction
was
once
more
at
her
lips
she
recalled
something
that
langdale
had
once
said
of
the
stimulating
aura
of
indefinable
demand
on
one
s
best
powers
to
polish
the
rude
rocks
of
capacity
into
blocks
fit
for
building
but
apart
from
any
subtle
appeal
to
the
mind
there
was
a
kind
of
implied
union
in
the
silent
fellowship
of
being
successfully
alive
which
she
shared
with
the
crowd
around
to
be
young
and
well
clad
and
walk
upright
with
limbs
with
eyes
undimmed
with
fears
with
a
capacity
for
happiness
was
a
form
of
responsive
loyalty
to
the
life
that
surged
around
everything
appeared
to
her
so
unworn
and
fresh
she
was
alive
in
every
faculty
and
stirred
as
with
the
tender
novelty
in
which
objects
present
themselves
to
us
in
early
childhood
fancy
imagination
and
memory
all
were
buoyant
as
young
birds
that
had
newly
learned
to
cleave
the
air
the
feeling
now
and
then
was
uppermost
that
she
had
in
some
way
gone
back
to
an
earlier
stage
of
some
indefinable
weight
had
slipped
off
her
it
was
as
though
nature
had
taken
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
back
smilingly
from
the
sophistry
of
her
back
to
the
primal
instincts
of
life
blotting
out
the
officious
thou
shalt
and
shalt
not
of
defunct
generations
as
impertinent
intermeddling
with
a
joy
all
her
own
perhaps
there
are
forces
slumbering
in
the
mind
which
waken
into
activity
but
for
one
brief
hour
of
the
years
which
are
given
to
us
here
it
may
be
that
on
this
morning
if
never
again
stella
was
subtly
influenced
by
the
bare
untrammelled
aspects
of
her
native
the
vast
unpeopled
spaces
which
hold
no
claim
from
the
past
and
lay
no
ghostly
charges
on
human
beings
to
postpone
their
lives
for
the
sake
of
those
who
have
been
and
those
who
are
to
come
and
yet
it
was
vagrant
recollections
of
one
of
the
wildernesses
of
her
country
that
first
quelled
the
glad
ardour
of
her
mood
in
the
midst
of
her
content
at
being
among
crowds
of
unknown
men
and
women
she
recalled
how
often
people
spoke
of
the
solitude
of
a
strange
city
being
more
absolute
than
that
of
a
desert
instantaneously
she
saw
before
her
an
austere
stretch
of
mallee
scrub
what
moody
melancholy
the
reality
would
troops
of
questions
questions
of
what
a
quick
inexplicable
pang
shot
through
her
dread
like
that
which
comes
in
a
dream
of
the
night
when
one
who
has
long
ago
passed
beyond
reach
and
recall
stands
in
the
masking
appearance
of
life
and
the
sleeper
shrinks
from
the
blank
of
awakening
but
it
was
a
momentary
feeling
she
made
her
purchases
and
then
passed
out
of
oxford
street
by
way
of
audley
street
purposely
taking
a
circuitous
route
to
the
westham
hotel
she
wanted
to
walk
give
herself
up
to
the
full
sway
of
this
swift
strong
return
of
mental
and
physical
but
like
the
refrain
of
a
song
which
once
heard
long
ago
comes
back
to
haunt
us
one
day
we
know
not
why
the
thought
of
the
great
mallee
desert
kept
rising
up
before
her
the
days
she
had
wandered
books
she
had
thoughts
that
had
come
to
her
of
the
people
who
had
fled
from
the
world
and
lived
in
desolate
places
for
the
salvation
of
their
soul
what
strange
delusions
men
had
put
upon
themselves
from
age
to
age
sacrificing
the
only
life
they
were
sure
of
to
vague
chimeras
of
unknown
modes
of
existence
then
her
mother
s
grave
sweet
voice
came
to
her
and
she
suddenly
found
the
tears
rising
in
her
eyes
she
wiped
them
half
angrily
i
must
write
and
tell
mother
she
thought
but
the
resolve
did
not
quiet
the
throng
of
thoughts
which
began
to
rise
my
beloved
child
how
i
long
to
see
you
once
more
give
me
fuller
details
of
your
daily
life
why
do
you
say
so
little
of
edward
he
wrote
with
such
faithful
regularity
when
you
were
ill
but
since
your
recovery
he
writes
no
these
and
other
extracts
from
the
home
letters
from
her
mother
s
especially
rose
before
her
nay
it
seemed
as
though
one
strode
beside
her
to
read
them
to
her
whether
she
would
or
no
she
went
over
the
past
few
months
again
in
as
if
she
were
pleading
her
case
before
an
unseen
tribunal
see
she
seemed
to
say
as
if
addressing
a
judge
how
hopelessly
all
my
future
would
have
been
wrecked
if
anselm
had
not
saved
me
from
myself
it
was
not
one
misfortune
that
overwhelmed
me
had
it
been
only
that
vile
plot
of
an
unscrupulous
me
out
of
the
one
great
happiness
of
would
have
somehow
borne
the
misery
perhaps
overcome
it
at
least
the
union
would
be
binding
that
i
am
sure
of
but
there
was
a
worse
moral
failure
of
the
man
who
married
me
concealing
his
subjection
to
drink
yes
one
may
overcome
this
for
a
time
but
there
is
always
the
possibility
of
a
relapse
a
year
of
what
value
is
that
when
in
one
hour
all
the
forces
of
habit
may
resume
full
sway
it
seemed
as
though
her
invisible
audience
looked
at
her
with
stern
searching
eyes
the
very
air
became
heavy
with
doubt
and
suspicion
we
have
made
no
plans
she
went
on
unconsciously
entering
on
the
defence
that
implies
accusation
we
have
in
common
the
power
of
sympathy
with
wide
impersonal
endeavours
we
are
capable
of
a
great
disinterested
friendship
that
time
and
intimacy
can
only
render
more
perfect
what
a
strange
power
of
the
mind
this
the
hour
of
keenest
elation
to
become
conscious
of
a
cloud
of
unseen
witnesses
who
are
satisfied
with
no
version
of
our
motives
short
of
absolute
veracity
after
all
that
she
could
urge
stella
was
in
the
end
shaken
dissatisfied
restless
it
is
part
of
the
morbid
phase
through
which
i
have
been
passing
she
thought
and
she
mechanically
hurried
on
as
if
to
escape
her
tribunal
her
explanations
the
doubts
that
were
incipient
fears
she
had
followed
audley
street
much
further
than
she
intended
and
now
struck
out
of
it
eastward
going
into
a
narrow
street
where
in
the
distance
she
saw
one
or
two
cabs
she
had
got
tired
and
wished
to
drive
back
to
the
westham
before
she
reached
them
she
was
startled
by
a
sudden
downpour
of
rain
at
the
same
moment
she
found
herself
opposite
the
open
porch
of
a
church
into
which
she
went
for
shelter
there
were
some
women
who
had
evidently
come
out
two
of
them
were
talking
together
which
cardinal
said
one
why
cardinal
newman
answered
the
other
the
name
reached
stella
awakening
many
slumbering
too
that
deep
chord
of
reverent
affection
which
the
soul
never
loses
for
those
who
have
at
one
time
illuminated
and
guided
it
even
though
we
may
have
lost
the
light
though
we
may
have
strayed
far
from
the
pastures
in
which
still
waters
flow
is
the
cardinal
here
she
asked
eagerly
service
is
almost
over
answered
the
woman
she
addressed
but
if
you
go
in
and
go
up
near
the
altar
you
can
see
him
very
well
she
added
kindly
acting
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
stella
went
in
but
even
as
she
entered
some
curious
intuition
crossed
her
misgiving
rather
that
this
simple
action
might
break
the
purpose
round
which
her
happiness
her
late
triumphant
sense
of
restored
had
centred
she
passed
noiselessly
up
the
left
aisle
and
took
a
seat
not
far
from
the
high
altar
where
she
was
partly
concealed
by
a
pillar
yes
the
service
was
almost
over
but
she
saw
him
man
whose
words
so
many
years
ago
in
her
careless
untroubled
girlhood
had
so
deeply
stirred
the
depths
of
her
inner
life
whose
voice
had
been
as
a
voice
from
heaven
to
guide
her
into
close
communion
with
god
but
the
voice
had
died
into
silence
and
all
the
glow
of
dawning
intercourse
with
a
kingdom
not
of
this
the
glad
fervour
of
left
her
and
often
it
had
seemed
good
to
her
that
she
had
been
so
early
emancipated
from
the
dogmatic
finalities
the
uncertain
certainties
full
of
contradictions
that
men
are
asked
to
receive
as
revelations
of
the
divine
will
but
now
that
the
first
spring
of
youth
was
barely
over
how
hard
and
cruel
life
had
become
and
what
was
the
bourne
to
which
she
had
turned
alas
had
she
so
soon
again
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
care
and
haggard
visitants
never
far
off
when
the
conscience
is
not
at
peace
but
soothed
with
anodynes
from
the
moment
that
she
knelt
within
the
church
all
that
had
blinded
her
was
swept
ruthlessly
away
it
was
like
the
letting
in
of
waters
whose
rising
tide
obliterates
the
paltry
landmarks
hastily
thrown
up
by
invading
scouts
who
had
no
legal
claim
to
the
country
she
heard
nothing
but
that
pale
spiritual
presence
the
high
noble
austere
ascetic
countenance
furrowed
with
years
and
face
keenly
symbolical
of
a
life
consecrated
to
the
service
of
god
and
man
she
saw
his
hands
joined
and
held
up
in
him
turn
to
the
people
and
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
them
and
she
bent
her
head
in
bitter
weeping
like
a
reed
shaken
by
a
great
storm
as
smoke
vanisheth
away
and
is
seen
no
more
so
was
she
forsaken
of
the
passionate
had
so
lately
thrilled
her
through
and
through
with
an
exalted
sense
of
vitality
low
and
lower
yet
her
head
was
bent
while
she
was
rent
with
piercing
sorrow
and
the
tears
drenched
her
face
like
rain
the
last
note
of
the
organ
died
away
the
last
footfalls
of
the
congregation
retreated
and
she
was
alone
in
the
house
of
with
the
still
small
voice
at
whose
sound
our
dearest
travesties
of
righteousness
shrivel
into
filthy
rags
she
had
wandered
so
long
and
so
far
and
near
her
was
the
image
of
the
crucified
she
had
betrayed
like
peter
of
old
and
the
lord
turned
and
looked
upon
peter
and
peter
went
out
and
wept
all
the
unsatisfied
yearning
for
belief
which
had
so
long
been
stilled
and
left
a
waste
place
in
her
heart
rose
into
new
life
and
with
this
the
anguish
of
a
penitent
convicted
of
innumerable
treasons
pierced
her
like
a
sword
there
are
experiences
of
the
soul
that
can
not
be
fathomed
they
are
beyond
the
reach
of
any
plummet
that
is
within
our
part
of
the
inscrutable
mystery
of
the
union
of
matter
and
spirit
there
are
moments
in
which
the
bruised
shaken
sorrowful
human
creature
sees
as
by
the
wild
devious
ways
by
which
the
spirit
is
lured
away
from
the
only
possession
that
is
everlasting
in
the
revulsion
of
feeling
that
overwhelmed
her
stella
could
for
a
time
frame
neither
words
nor
purpose
but
from
the
first
she
knew
that
she
dared
not
follow
the
path
which
so
short
a
time
before
had
been
to
her
as
the
only
one
that
led
into
the
citadel
of
life
and
hope
gradually
the
first
bitterness
and
tumult
ebbed
away
some
lines
that
he
had
once
read
to
her
father
came
back
to
her
but
as
i
raved
and
grew
more
fierce
and
wild
at
every
word
methought
i
heard
one
calling
child
and
i
replied
my
lord
yes
out
of
the
abysses
of
exceeding
darkness
which
first
fell
on
her
when
she
knew
that
the
only
purpose
which
seemed
to
make
life
possible
must
be
abandoned
there
gradually
emerged
a
faint
dawn
of
hope
after
all
her
weary
her
blindness
and
hardness
of
her
long
conviction
that
god
could
only
be
darkly
groped
after
never
securely
hoped
knew
once
more
that
the
chastisement
of
our
peace
was
upon
him
and
i
replied
my
lord
she
whispered
the
words
through
her
blinding
tears
and
even
her
great
unhappiness
was
an
earnest
to
her
that
notwithstanding
her
desertion
and
denial
and
callous
forgetfulness
and
unbelief
she
had
not
been
cast
off
utterly
more
and
more
piercingly
she
realized
how
her
own
pride
and
vanity
and
impatience
of
suffering
had
been
at
the
root
of
the
evil
that
had
overtaken
her
a
scorching
sense
of
shame
at
her
infidelity
to
the
higher
loyalties
of
justice
and
generosity
overcame
her
waves
of
cutting
remorse
swept
over
her
as
she
reviewed
her
conduct
in
her
relationship
with
her
husband
how
indifferent
and
hard
she
had
been
all
these
all
companionship
with
him
never
seeking
to
win
him
to
any
interest
or
pursuit
beyond
the
narrow
groove
in
which
his
life
had
always
run
she
was
perhaps
a
little
unfair
to
herself
as
she
reviewed
her
conduct
in
this
respect
as
we
are
apt
to
be
in
our
as
well
as
in
our
in
reality
being
often
grounded
on
ignorance
there
are
periods
in
people
s
lives
when
everything
is
against
the
currents
that
might
have
floated
them
into
a
quiet
haven
conspire
only
to
dash
them
against
the
rocks
but
yet
the
truth
was
on
the
first
evidence
of
the
power
of
evil
habit
over
her
husband
she
had
stood
coldly
aloof
as
if
on
his
part
absolved
her
from
all
lot
or
concern
in
his
fate
she
recalled
how
in
speaking
of
him
she
had
even
inferred
that
he
could
not
help
that
the
spirit
of
man
no
more
than
his
body
can
have
any
source
of
impulse
or
action
apart
from
the
inexorable
links
of
material
causes
could
the
spirit
of
evil
itself
help
to
wreck
men
with
a
darker
atheism
than
this
he
had
so
keen
an
appreciation
of
what
was
good
in
to
perceive
how
men
s
failings
and
vices
are
often
a
forced
rather
than
a
wilful
product
always
he
expected
them
to
live
down
the
hold
to
and
cultivate
the
better
side
of
their
where
had
she
read
or
heard
the
words
was
not
this
indeed
the
very
core
of
moral
influence
and
then
came
back
to
her
the
words
of
one
of
the
fathers
to
one
who
had
tried
to
take
his
life
thy
crime
has
made
thee
mine
see
that
henceforth
thou
walkest
worthily
of
me
and
of
god
to
whom
thou
the
belief
that
evil
may
be
spring
of
moral
basely
she
had
denied
it
by
word
and
action
what
had
become
of
the
early
church
when
so
much
of
its
endeavours
lay
among
those
enslaved
and
the
descendants
of
those
enslaved
by
the
darkest
forms
of
sensuality
if
the
dicta
of
regarding
heredity
and
the
insignificance
of
man
s
will
had
prevailed
rather
than
the
divine
rule
believe
and
thou
shalt
be
saved
oh
how
cruelly
she
had
failed
in
that
care
for
the
better
nature
of
the
man
to
whom
she
had
promised
her
whole
life
how
completely
she
had
fallen
away
from
that
lofty
devotion
to
duty
which
is
the
truest
clearest
note
of
womanhood
and
looking
steadily
into
the
depths
of
her
unacknowledged
thoughts
into
the
dark
recesses
of
her
mind
she
convicted
herself
of
having
relied
on
ritchie
s
inability
to
overcome
his
besetting
having
rested
on
this
as
a
justification
of
her
own
future
actions
when
the
soul
is
penetrated
with
a
deep
sense
of
guilt
and
is
prostrated
in
utter
humiliation
no
thought
overcomes
it
with
such
bleeding
penitence
as
it
has
failed
another
in
the
day
of
need
she
was
consumed
with
shame
and
sorrow
and
yet
she
was
quickened
by
the
thought
that
here
her
downward
course
had
been
arrested
by
the
presence
of
that
priest
of
the
most
high
whose
words
had
so
early
fastened
on
her
heart
once
more
she
had
been
drawn
as
with
irresistible
cords
to
the
foot
of
the
cross
lv
after
stella
had
fought
down
the
first
amazed
opposition
to
her
changed
plans
a
sort
of
wonder
came
over
her
that
she
should
thus
throw
aside
all
that
seemed
like
the
substance
of
living
for
an
impalpable
for
dark
possibilities
that
began
to
lower
more
darkly
at
her
the
more
she
strove
to
face
the
future
with
deliberate
calmness
but
she
did
not
falter
in
her
purpose
and
gradually
the
powers
which
man
in
all
ages
has
found
in
work
and
prayer
came
to
her
aid
after
she
had
seen
langdale
and
bidden
him
farewell
the
worst
was
over
he
returned
to
london
three
days
before
farningham
sailed
when
stella
saw
him
in
his
sister
s
he
had
already
learned
of
the
change
of
plans
you
must
come
with
me
anselm
now
that
ritchie
has
decided
to
remain
she
seems
to
lose
her
interest
in
things
mysteriously
she
does
nothing
now
but
visit
rookeries
at
the
i
mean
you
must
sail
in
the
same
boat
with
presently
stella
came
in
you
are
not
so
well
again
he
said
quickly
noticing
at
once
the
entire
change
in
her
aspect
since
he
had
last
seen
her
oh
i
am
only
a
little
tired
she
answered
but
her
face
had
grown
still
paler
an
old
friend
of
her
mother
s
called
and
farningham
went
with
her
into
the
nursery
amalie
tells
me
you
are
not
going
with
her
to
the
east
langdale
said
when
they
were
alone
i
wanted
to
tell
you
personally
and
to
say
farewell
he
repeated
he
walked
hastily
to
one
of
the
windows
then
he
came
back
and
stood
by
the
a
little
way
from
where
she
sat
stella
do
not
be
afraid
he
said
in
an
agitated
voice
i
shall
never
say
a
word
nor
urge
a
claim
to
your
attention
beyond
what
you
judge
would
be
right
you
have
been
so
much
better
but
even
in
this
short
time
you
have
lost
in
my
weakness
my
selfishness
my
forgetfulness
of
duty
you
have
been
so
good
to
me
you
must
let
me
say
this
before
we
part
she
said
hurriedly
and
as
if
she
had
not
heard
what
he
said
so
good
to
you
he
echoed
as
if
the
words
hurt
him
and
then
he
checked
himself
stella
do
not
try
your
nature
beyond
what
it
can
bear
go
with
my
sister
as
you
purposed
doing
i
will
not
see
you
nor
even
write
to
you
gain
complete
strength
of
mind
and
body
and
then
decide
what
you
ought
to
do
stella
you
may
trust
me
and
if
you
do
not
go
to
the
east
let
me
write
to
madonna
it
is
not
fit
that
you
should
be
left
so
much
alone
you
are
not
as
strong
as
you
think
i
have
written
a
long
letter
to
hector
which
i
delayed
sending
till
you
were
well
enough
to
read
we
must
not
send
it
we
have
so
far
overlived
our
sorrow
without
paining
others
and
now
the
worst
is
there
was
a
little
break
in
her
voice
as
she
said
the
last
words
she
was
outwardly
calm
but
the
anguish
at
her
heart
made
the
words
seem
unreal
even
to
herself
langdale
looked
at
her
fixedly
and
was
about
to
speak
but
he
checked
himself
and
again
leant
against
the
mantelpiece
shading
his
eyes
with
one
hand
there
was
a
long
pause
and
then
stella
spoke
again
do
not
fear
for
me
anselm
hitherto
i
have
been
thinking
chiefly
of
others
for
the
unhappiness
that
has
overtaken
us
brooding
over
mistakes
instead
of
seeking
to
set
them
right
i
will
no
longer
think
of
is
a
melancholy
her
smile
was
sad
but
her
face
had
in
it
more
of
the
old
alertness
the
being
alive
to
the
curiously
unadjusted
qualities
and
defects
of
life
than
she
had
shown
since
their
first
painful
meeting
in
the
old
world
then
she
told
him
what
had
led
to
her
sudden
change
of
plans
as
she
did
so
something
of
her
old
vigour
and
ardour
of
expression
came
back
but
in
all
mental
conflicts
there
are
so
many
forces
at
work
which
we
but
dimly
apprehend
we
can
but
say
that
we
have
been
defeated
or
gained
a
victory
which
leaves
us
more
humiliated
more
mistrustful
of
our
hearts
than
ever
before
the
process
we
can
not
fully
explain
to
ourselves
much
less
to
others
you
feel
just
now
he
said
slowly
when
she
had
ceased
speaking
that
you
should
sacrifice
all
your
individuality
all
your
life
in
reparation
for
a
fancied
wrong
but
can
you
endure
the
punishment
do
you
realize
the
no
not
punishment
she
said
eagerly
interrupting
him
it
is
punishment
when
we
are
allowed
to
follow
our
own
devices
when
we
are
dead
to
endeavour
to
patience
to
the
beautiful
spirit
that
leads
us
on
white
and
serene
and
gentle
as
the
angel
of
the
dew
and
bids
us
never
despair
of
overcoming
our
own
follies
of
helping
others
to
better
effort
and
aspiration
i
have
been
so
long
the
unresisting
victim
of
despair
but
once
more
god
has
called
me
do
not
pity
me
anselm
be
sorry
for
me
only
in
the
time
when
i
was
insensible
to
with
the
noise
of
the
chain
of
mortality
so
that
i
could
hear
none
of
the
voices
by
which
god
calls
us
oh
it
is
true
he
does
call
us
and
when
we
hear
him
the
poison
is
drawn
out
of
our
darkest
sorrows
dear
friend
how
can
i
explain
myself
all
the
sharpest
pangs
that
i
have
suffered
all
that
i
must
endure
seem
to
me
a
proof
of
the
love
of
god
i
see
that
if
i
had
been
happy
in
the
way
i
had
chosen
it
would
mean
that
he
had
utterly
forgotten
me
to
myself
and
when
that
happens
it
is
not
only
ourselves
we
hurt
we
spoil
the
lives
of
do
not
let
us
deceive
ourselves
he
answered
in
a
voice
which
despite
his
vibrated
with
keen
anguish
we
have
been
robbed
and
cheated
in
our
final
separation
we
lose
the
best
possibilities
that
life
can
offer
i
can
only
submit
but
i
can
not
pretend
to
see
in
this
chaos
of
duplicity
any
glimmering
of
divine
guidance
at
last
it
is
brought
home
to
me
that
life
may
become
so
poor
and
maimed
a
thing
that
it
is
not
greatly
worth
oh
do
not
say
that
she
cried
looking
into
his
face
imploringly
i
know
that
in
all
the
years
to
come
there
will
be
moments
of
anguished
recollection
twilight
or
the
rose
of
dawn
a
strain
of
music
a
chance
picture
the
glow
of
sunset
a
bud
opening
in
spring
the
song
of
a
bird
any
sight
or
sound
that
searches
the
depths
of
our
know
not
the
things
that
touch
us
most
may
be
charged
with
a
burden
of
sense
of
loss
a
pain
whose
edge
can
never
be
entirely
blunted
but
the
pain
and
the
loss
and
the
unconquerable
yearning
let
us
take
them
by
the
hand
and
make
them
the
companions
of
our
wiser
hours
in
seeking
after
the
best
that
we
can
reach
each
cup
of
suffering
every
pang
of
sorrow
may
breathe
into
our
lives
that
finer
spirit
of
all
ah
stella
stella
must
i
lose
you
hear
your
voice
no
more
what
can
comfort
me
for
this
he
said
looking
at
her
with
dimmed
eyes
he
turned
away
abruptly
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
then
he
came
back
to
where
she
stood
and
resumed
in
a
calmer
voice
and
to
make
the
loss
more
intolerable
there
is
the
fact
that
our
happiness
was
wrecked
by
the
miserable
intrigue
of
that
wretched
woman
there
are
creatures
so
low
down
in
the
scale
of
nature
that
the
whole
nervous
system
consists
of
a
slender
cord
that
has
a
little
bulge
by
way
of
a
brain
near
the
mouth
that
is
about
the
type
morally
of
a
being
who
could
act
as
she
did
and
yet
she
is
to
go
even
from
any
sense
of
shame
but
no
i
shall
yet
in
some
way
expose
her
said
langdale
with
flashing
eyes
it
was
not
only
the
irreparable
mischief
to
both
their
lives
that
made
tareling
s
immunity
from
all
penalty
so
intolerable
to
him
but
also
the
recoil
against
injustice
which
as
a
rule
moves
a
man
more
keenly
than
a
woman
let
us
admit
he
said
in
a
lower
tone
that
we
have
been
as
for
yes
betrayed
by
me
answered
stella
in
a
low
voice
langdale
made
a
gesture
of
denial
but
stella
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
standing
close
beside
him
repeated
yes
it
is
true
in
the
end
no
one
can
betray
us
but
ourselves
if
instead
of
being
governed
by
wounded
pride
and
fierce
jealousy
i
had
resigned
that
is
if
you
had
been
some
other
human
being
instead
of
yourself
stella
this
is
unreasonable
and
then
she
went
on
speaking
with
some
difficulty
it
would
be
wrong
for
me
not
to
tell
you
that
in
the
first
bitterness
of
our
meeting
i
now
feel
i
spoke
in
a
way
that
reflected
unduly
on
my
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
spoken
the
word
in
his
hearing
and
as
he
heard
it
langdale
coloured
deeply
you
will
i
think
believe
he
returned
after
a
pause
that
i
could
not
try
to
urge
you
to
any
line
of
action
merely
in
my
own
interests
i
have
been
content
to
drift
in
this
i
have
formed
plans
and
given
them
up
the
chief
thing
was
that
you
should
first
recover
you
had
in
a
measure
done
so
when
this
ardour
for
nullifying
your
life
seized
you
but
beware
of
doing
your
own
inner
nature
and
instincts
a
great
violence
you
were
imposed
upon
and
feloniously
betrayed
granted
that
you
should
not
under
any
circumstances
have
been
cheated
into
such
a
marriage
still
there
are
certain
forms
of
temptation
to
which
every
nature
will
succumb
under
given
circumstances
but
is
it
right
to
attempt
fidelity
to
a
bond
that
may
eventually
wreck
your
life
anyone
may
be
hurried
into
into
an
unmoral
course
of
the
fatal
thing
is
the
not
repenting
or
foisting
ecclesiastical
perversions
upon
the
conscience
morals
have
been
evolved
to
save
not
to
crush
to
make
it
impossible
for
us
to
work
out
the
salvation
of
our
better
natures
of
course
i
do
not
use
the
word
in
its
priestly
you
are
afraid
for
me
she
answered
in
a
faltering
voice
but
believe
me
weak
and
unstable
as
i
have
before
been
i
know
now
that
i
am
no
longer
blinded
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
anselm
i
am
afraid
of
myself
if
i
went
now
with
your
sister
ah
you
have
understood
what
it
meant
we
both
know
the
tyrannical
limitations
of
life
and
then
do
what
we
could
give
us
back
the
her
voice
failed
her
and
there
was
silence
for
a
little
time
i
must
abide
by
your
decision
he
said
in
a
low
voice
many
thoughts
had
crowded
into
her
mind
that
threatened
to
sweep
away
her
composure
but
the
necessity
of
saying
something
of
all
she
owed
to
him
nerved
her
will
it
comfort
you
at
all
to
know
that
you
have
been
in
truth
my
best
friend
in
the
days
of
my
utmost
weakness
and
despair
you
led
me
back
from
the
brink
of
insanity
you
were
entirely
forgetful
of
self
kind
with
the
delicate
kindness
of
a
chivalrous
must
hear
me
you
helped
me
day
by
day
and
yet
kept
out
of
my
way
you
knew
you
had
only
to
speak
in
those
dark
days
and
i
would
have
gone
with
you
gladly
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
no
tie
no
consideration
would
have
held
me
you
saved
me
from
worse
than
death
after
all
that
had
happened
you
might
well
have
considered
that
my
life
was
yours
it
is
so
much
the
creed
of
the
world
that
a
man
s
strength
does
not
consist
in
tender
consideration
of
a
woman
s
weakness
oh
my
friend
my
friend
can
you
ever
know
from
what
an
abyss
you
saved
me
a
man
s
life
is
so
much
more
twofold
than
a
woman
s
he
has
his
work
and
his
place
to
fill
in
the
world
she
has
the
large
leisure
of
home
and
if
at
her
side
the
phantom
comes
of
broken
vows
and
duties
trampled
under
foot
the
spring
of
her
life
is
poisoned
at
the
source
if
our
lives
were
given
only
for
such
happiness
as
we
could
he
was
deeply
touched
by
the
pathetic
intensity
of
her
too
by
the
truth
of
what
she
said
he
knew
how
the
world
is
strewn
with
the
wrecks
of
anarchy
in
conduct
he
was
too
close
an
observer
of
human
affairs
not
to
know
that
the
wider
and
deeper
a
woman
s
nature
is
the
more
surely
does
it
suffer
under
the
consciousness
of
having
in
any
crisis
of
life
chosen
what
was
pleasant
rather
than
what
was
right
and
though
he
held
that
it
would
be
as
irrational
to
place
all
who
repudiate
the
bond
of
marriage
on
the
same
level
as
it
would
be
to
condemn
the
legal
tie
because
of
its
many
and
bitter
failures
yet
in
his
calmer
more
detached
thoughts
all
his
experience
of
things
as
they
are
led
him
to
shrink
from
the
shadow
of
blame
on
the
one
woman
who
had
exalted
and
widened
his
ideal
of
her
sex
and
yet
how
well
he
knew
that
an
open
rupture
not
only
with
the
conventional
decorums
of
society
but
with
a
great
law
is
infinitely
more
healthful
for
a
sensitive
nature
than
the
slow
moral
corrosion
of
enforced
companionship
with
a
hopelessly
inferior
mind
it
was
under
the
circumstances
inevitable
that
he
should
think
much
worse
of
ritchie
than
he
deserved
but
he
began
to
perceive
that
in
the
awakening
of
the
strong
religious
instinct
of
her
nature
stella
might
find
an
antidote
against
the
more
subtle
evils
of
her
lot
only
all
his
training
as
well
as
his
inherited
instincts
on
the
question
led
him
to
mistrust
the
variability
of
the
devotional
temperament
could
this
impetus
last
would
it
turn
into
a
broken
reed
to
wound
her
more
incurably
than
ever
before
even
in
the
midst
of
the
dull
deep
pain
the
sense
of
an
catastrophe
the
utter
vacuity
that
for
the
time
swallowed
all
which
before
had
been
of
deep
interest
to
him
this
question
rose
itself
on
him
this
strong
influence
that
has
suddenly
taken
hold
of
you
you
sure
it
is
something
more
than
a
phantasm
i
am
glad
you
have
asked
this
she
answered
quickly
there
are
some
things
we
can
not
well
speak
of
unless
we
are
sure
of
sympathy
the
day
after
i
had
been
in
the
church
i
went
again
early
in
the
morning
i
felt
smitten
to
the
very
of
all
the
joy
and
pride
of
life
but
the
moment
i
looked
upon
that
pale
figure
nailed
on
the
cross
and
knelt
not
to
pray
but
simply
to
cry
like
a
child
who
has
wandered
far
far
from
its
father
s
house
and
comes
back
too
tired
and
frightened
to
do
more
than
creep
into
a
i
knew
that
though
i
may
never
be
an
orthodox
catholic
yet
the
old
faith
had
so
far
revived
as
to
be
an
inspiring
rule
of
life
to
give
a
vivifying
motive
to
every
exertion
you
know
there
are
some
things
after
all
that
we
can
be
quite
sure
of
we
know
anselm
you
and
i
that
though
our
lives
are
to
be
widely
langdale
gave
a
great
sigh
which
was
almost
a
groan
at
the
sound
stella
s
face
flushed
faintly
and
with
an
evident
effort
at
composure
she
went
on
yet
the
day
can
never
come
in
which
we
shall
be
indifferent
to
each
other
and
in
the
same
way
we
may
know
with
a
conviction
beyond
dispute
that
behind
all
the
confusion
and
mystery
of
life
there
runs
a
great
sane
purpose
with
which
we
may
join
our
wills
and
lives
in
the
end
the
most
we
can
hope
to
do
must
be
limited
to
a
small
patch
of
the
world
and
as
far
as
our
personal
influence
can
reach
to
spoil
that
for
the
sake
of
any
you
know
the
rough
and
ready
classifications
of
the
i
apprehend
your
meaning
stella
certainly
if
our
lives
were
given
us
chiefly
for
happiness
our
parting
would
be
a
crime
perhaps
it
is
not
in
very
truth
it
is
not
so
returned
stella
a
glow
lighting
up
her
whole
face
as
she
looked
steadfastly
at
her
friend
and
then
when
you
come
out
of
the
you
are
in
actual
contact
with
the
depths
of
human
misery
in
this
vast
you
find
any
clue
that
satisfies
your
conscience
and
reason
why
a
world
supposed
to
be
under
the
loving
rule
of
an
omnipotent
creator
should
present
so
strange
a
spectacle
in
the
last
three
days
she
answered
slowly
i
have
been
a
good
deal
with
some
people
who
are
working
among
the
poorest
and
some
of
the
most
depraved
in
the
ah
my
god
what
pictures
have
burnt
themselves
into
my
memory
ineffaceable
ones
of
the
faces
of
young
girls
that
still
keep
something
of
the
dewy
innocence
of
childhood
and
yet
are
engulfed
in
living
death
women
unsexed
men
without
manhood
youth
without
purity
childhood
that
has
never
known
the
sanctity
of
always
where
there
are
alleys
reeking
with
bad
air
are
courts
full
of
filth
where
there
are
men
sodden
with
drink
and
women
in
shameless
rags
there
everywhere
are
children
in
swarms
two
nights
ago
i
could
not
sleep
they
passed
before
me
in
endless
processions
those
maimed
ruined
existences
fit
only
to
be
huddled
out
of
be
imprisoned
like
lepers
so
as
to
stamp
out
the
contagion
at
last
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
i
rose
up
in
the
darkness
and
fell
on
my
knees
but
i
could
not
pray
o
god
dost
thou
not
care
at
all
was
all
i
could
say
over
and
over
with
a
stupid
blank
amazement
and
then
all
at
can
i
tell
you
the
tears
forced
themselves
into
her
eyes
she
was
very
pale
and
her
lips
were
quivering
yet
all
the
time
her
face
was
lit
with
that
grave
spiritual
light
which
irradiates
the
countenance
when
the
heart
is
quickened
with
impersonal
zeal
and
thought
try
and
tell
want
to
know
said
langdale
in
a
low
voice
his
eyes
were
dim
with
feelings
too
poignant
to
be
borne
with
clear
deep
to
be
relieved
by
words
i
that
this
even
this
wild
cruel
anarchy
was
not
born
of
chaos
it
was
the
shadow
side
of
the
highest
possibilities
of
our
nature
because
we
have
power
to
aspire
to
communion
with
god
so
human
beings
have
the
power
to
fall
and
be
submerged
in
the
black
eddies
of
shame
and
pollution
this
was
the
embodiment
of
that
principle
of
evil
which
everyone
who
turns
away
from
the
pitiful
egoism
of
must
strive
fight
to
subdue
then
i
saw
that
other
great
army
of
which
you
have
often
spoken
to
men
and
women
sown
broadcast
over
the
whole
land
who
amid
all
the
moral
deformity
of
life
neither
flee
from
the
world
nor
are
sick
of
it
nor
despair
of
the
capacity
of
our
common
nature
for
those
things
which
are
good
and
true
and
of
lovely
report
i
saw
them
women
of
lonely
undistinguished
firm
in
the
constancy
of
principle
touched
with
the
gentleness
of
unweariable
love
men
of
all
grades
enfranchised
from
the
corrupt
propensities
that
make
our
race
the
willing
slaves
of
evil
steadily
constantly
working
for
the
moral
renovation
of
their
doing
a
little
each
helping
to
stem
the
tide
of
human
misery
here
a
delicate
girl
giving
time
and
thought
to
hours
of
intercourse
with
rough
factory
lads
and
in
a
heart
here
and
there
the
better
impulses
that
lie
dormant
often
only
because
no
care
nor
gentleness
has
breathed
on
the
timid
seeds
and
wooed
them
into
life
yes
even
the
little
i
have
seen
helped
me
to
estimate
how
true
was
what
you
once
said
that
almost
all
who
have
any
of
time
and
means
take
thought
for
some
of
those
less
fortunately
placed
to
touch
one
or
two
minds
to
finer
rescue
one
or
two
lives
from
the
appalling
depths
ready
to
swamp
is
not
a
very
bold
or
ambitious
object
and
yet
to
set
it
before
ourselves
we
must
be
sure
that
no
siren
voice
has
deluded
us
into
making
the
life
of
any
more
open
to
the
temptations
which
beset
him
more
callous
to
belief
in
the
goodness
of
others
anselm
when
these
thoughts
swept
over
me
my
heart
throbbed
with
gratitude
to
pride
in
your
unselfish
goodness
it
was
to
you
i
owed
it
that
the
nessus
robe
of
passion
had
not
scorched
and
laid
waste
my
he
was
too
much
moved
to
trust
himself
to
speak
for
a
little
time
at
last
he
said
slowly
i
do
not
think
that
i
will
now
go
to
the
east
may
we
not
return
to
the
old
footing
of
friends
let
me
see
you
from
time
to
time
as
long
as
you
are
in
london
there
was
a
pleading
tone
in
his
voice
to
which
every
fibre
of
her
nature
responded
but
her
victory
over
herself
was
too
hardly
won
too
insecure
too
bitterly
steeped
in
the
struggles
that
seem
to
exhaust
the
very
founts
of
action
and
resolve
she
felt
too
keenly
how
impossible
the
tranquillity
of
friendship
would
be
for
them
both
for
some
time
to
come
i
think
you
should
go
with
is
very
anxious
about
the
boy
i
want
you
to
go
and
then
she
added
not
meeting
his
eyes
while
she
said
it
perhaps
in
the
time
to
come
we
may
both
find
that
a
new
plan
of
life
opened
to
us
after
this
if
you
wish
it
very
much
i
will
go
for
your
sake
he
answered
then
she
stood
up
to
bid
him
farewell
there
is
one
question
stella
will
you
let
me
ask
it
you
are
satisfied
that
ritchie
knew
nothing
of
the
perfidy
practised
by
his
sister
he
is
incapable
of
so
mean
an
of
all
against
she
raised
her
head
proudly
and
the
look
on
her
face
cut
him
to
the
soul
and
yet
consoled
him
let
those
who
have
solved
the
contradictions
of
our
inscrutably
involved
nature
explain
the
enigma
there
was
silence
between
them
for
a
few
moments
then
he
took
both
her
hands
in
his
each
looked
for
a
little
into
the
other
s
face
and
they
parted
a
few
moments
after
langdale
left
the
hotel
he
was
hailed
by
an
old
insisted
on
carrying
him
off
to
james
s
hospital
to
see
a
man
who
mysteriously
kept
on
living
while
every
principle
known
to
medical
science
clearly
proved
that
he
should
have
died
three
days
previously
stella
in
the
meantime
was
lying
prone
in
a
darkened
room
lost
to
all
thought
or
sensation
except
the
consciousness
that
her
life
had
in
very
truth
passed
from
her
but
after
a
time
she
remembered
that
she
had
promised
ted
to
accompany
him
that
evening
to
see
irvine
s
macbeth
and
she
knew
how
infinitely
disappointed
he
would
be
if
she
failed
to
keep
the
appointment
she
therefore
rose
and
summoned
maisie
to
dress
her
we
are
aided
by
the
limitations
of
life
as
well
as
by
its
rarer
hours
of
illuminating
insight
habit
routine
three
gray
sisters
who
in
the
liquid
dew
of
youth
fill
us
with
languor
with
impatient
scorn
and
softly
and
securely
they
lead
us
by
the
hand
when
the
roses
of
passion
are
overblown
and
trampled
under
foot
lvi
three
days
later
langdale
sailed
for
the
east
in
company
with
his
sister
it
beats
me
hollow
stella
to
imagine
why
you
didn
t
go
with
them
said
ritchie
that
evening
in
a
tone
of
wondering
expostulation
like
all
solidly
practical
people
he
disliked
treating
fixed
arrangements
as
airy
outlines
of
things
not
to
be
done
and
the
thought
weighed
on
him
still
more
that
stella
would
now
be
so
much
alone
while
he
and
farningham
were
gallivanting
about
as
he
phrased
it
from
one
racecourse
to
another
the
thought
of
those
endless
horsey
excited
crowds
began
to
weary
him
in
advance
and
then
stella
s
new
plan
of
going
so
often
to
church
and
so
much
among
the
poor
gave
ted
a
melancholy
conviction
that
she
must
be
feeling
very
he
had
of
late
noticed
that
look
again
on
stella
s
face
that
his
acquaintance
on
board
the
had
in
ignorance
of
their
relationship
described
as
being
that
of
a
or
a
person
who
had
seen
a
ghost
only
along
with
this
there
was
not
that
shrinking
avoidance
of
his
society
which
had
so
deeply
wounded
him
for
some
time
before
her
change
of
plans
she
did
not
reply
to
his
observation
but
took
up
a
letter
that
lay
on
a
table
near
her
glanced
over
it
and
then
looked
up
at
him
as
if
about
to
speak
stella
had
fully
decided
that
ritchie
must
ultimately
know
all
the
past
would
be
too
full
of
ghostly
memories
too
deeply
riddled
with
secret
depths
to
make
their
joint
lives
tolerable
if
he
were
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
events
that
had
brought
her
to
death
s
door
and
had
so
much
widened
the
distance
between
them
during
the
past
dark
months
in
the
last
days
she
had
seen
how
culpable
she
had
been
in
the
old
days
in
the
careless
irresponsible
way
in
which
she
had
accepted
ted
s
homage
for
so
many
years
she
realized
that
if
her
own
happiness
had
been
secured
as
langdale
s
wife
ted
s
life
would
have
been
wrecked
even
as
it
she
thought
with
a
sinking
heart
and
yet
the
more
she
strove
to
see
things
clearly
and
dispassionately
the
more
convinced
she
was
that
his
weakness
in
the
past
had
nothing
of
that
moral
cretinism
which
makes
the
hope
of
a
permanently
restored
power
of
will
a
fond
delusion
who
shall
find
a
valiant
woman
the
heart
of
her
husband
trusteth
in
her
she
will
render
him
good
and
not
evil
all
the
days
of
her
yes
this
must
be
her
aim
and
as
the
days
went
on
and
the
passionate
sorrow
that
had
consumed
her
lost
its
poignancy
she
would
learn
to
to
even
if
she
could
she
would
not
have
their
marriage
undone
at
the
cost
of
ted
s
misery
and
probable
degradation
you
married
because
laurette
behaved
worse
than
a
thief
and
a
liar
and
now
stella
you
are
she
knew
so
well
the
direct
uncompromising
terms
into
which
ted
would
put
the
situation
no
ted
i
am
not
and
i
would
not
if
i
could
go
back
on
our
on
the
day
that
she
could
say
this
with
truth
she
would
tell
him
all
such
had
been
her
resolve
but
on
the
evening
of
this
day
when
life
seemed
to
be
merged
into
a
listless
mechanical
round
when
all
the
better
possibilities
of
aspiration
and
close
sympathy
and
personal
joy
seemed
to
have
swept
by
like
a
vessel
in
while
she
crouched
like
a
forlorn
castaway
on
a
desolate
island
watching
the
last
sunrays
fall
on
the
gallant
barque
that
would
soon
be
lost
to
sight
she
told
herself
that
such
a
purpose
was
idle
i
can
t
flatter
myself
went
on
ted
after
a
pause
that
it
is
on
my
account
you
gave
farningham
the
slip
almost
at
the
last
he
did
not
speak
in
an
aggrieved
tone
but
rather
with
an
accent
of
wistful
inquiry
curiously
at
variance
with
his
words
stella
had
almost
finished
the
letter
she
had
taken
up
when
ted
made
this
second
observation
it
was
one
that
had
reached
her
on
the
previous
day
from
laurette
in
which
she
implored
stella
that
the
mishap
about
langdale
s
letter
might
be
kept
from
her
brother
s
knowledge
i
can
see
she
went
on
by
the
way
ted
writes
that
as
yet
he
knows
nothing
dear
dear
stella
this
is
very
noble
and
generous
of
you
i
dare
say
your
dangerous
illness
made
you
see
things
differently
i
have
little
doubt
that
you
will
prevent
langdale
with
your
usual
clear
discrimination
from
covering
himself
with
ridicule
by
any
appeal
to
law
after
all
people
do
not
marry
because
others
write
or
suppress
letters
still
i
candidly
admit
that
my
zeal
on
ted
s
fear
too
lest
you
should
find
yourself
involved
in
one
of
those
unhappy
entanglements
which
wreck
all
a
girl
s
future
my
judgment
it
seems
as
if
there
were
a
de
in
our
lives
which
makes
affection
and
not
honour
the
great
motive
of
our
actions
we
are
soon
to
leave
for
england
and
hope
to
meet
you
there
dear
stella
let
our
reunion
be
that
of
those
who
are
not
only
closely
linked
by
a
tender
relationship
but
also
those
who
have
been
dear
friends
from
childhood
might
it
not
be
possible
for
us
to
take
a
house
together
for
the
rest
of
the
london
season
we
shall
probably
be
there
by
the
middle
of
june
possibly
the
great
mower
death
may
render
it
unnecessary
for
us
to
hire
a
house
the
near
prospect
of
rank
and
station
in
crammed
with
cold
decorum
for
the
weaker
sex
with
unbounded
opportunities
of
ruin
for
men
and
with
fog
for
all
if
australian
travellers
speak
my
heart
yearn
more
than
ever
for
those
i
love
your
little
nephew
and
niece
are
clamouring
round
me
when
i
tell
them
i
am
writing
to
aunt
stella
they
clap
their
little
hands
thinking
you
are
coming
but
i
tell
them
you
are
far
far
away
and
that
we
must
come
to
you
and
uncle
ted
dear
talbot
is
not
very
well
of
to
be
at
all
anxious
about
in
fact
i
think
it
is
connected
with
his
dining
so
frequently
at
the
club
with
men
who
now
that
he
is
on
the
eve
of
leaving
australia
are
anxious
to
show
their
cordiality
however
his
small
ailments
make
him
only
more
domesticated
and
i
may
say
affectionate
perhaps
that
is
why
we
women
are
accused
of
being
so
fond
of
nursing
when
pain
and
anguish
wring
the
brow
etc
no
wonder
we
love
dear
sir
walter
he
understood
us
well
with
all
our
foibles
which
in
the
end
seem
only
to
endear
us
all
the
more
to
the
best
sort
of
men
by
the
way
ted
left
his
lady
of
the
lake
you
gave
him
at
monico
lodge
shall
i
bring
it
to
you
but
i
forget
there
will
not
be
time
for
a
reply
when
i
was
at
cannawijera
a
month
ago
i
thought
of
your
enthusiasm
for
the
mallee
scrub
seeing
it
for
the
last
time
seemed
to
help
me
to
understand
your
i
had
better
give
ted
this
letter
to
read
and
then
tell
him
all
what
better
opportunity
can
come
and
as
for
waiting
for
an
indefinite
thought
stella
wearily
she
could
speak
now
without
tears
or
faltering
that
strange
feeling
of
unreality
which
often
follows
close
on
prolonged
emotion
had
seized
her
it
seemed
as
though
she
could
speak
of
herself
as
calmly
as
if
she
were
a
japanese
with
whose
performances
she
had
nothing
to
do
beyond
an
amazed
looking
on
she
glanced
up
and
found
ted
s
gaze
fixed
searchingly
on
her
face
when
their
eyes
met
he
flushed
and
said
hurriedly
forgive
me
stella
you
look
more
dead
than
here
am
i
slanging
you
like
a
great
muff
as
i
his
quick
penitence
when
betrayed
into
any
natural
show
of
impatience
at
what
must
appear
to
him
unreasonable
caprice
touched
her
and
then
that
saving
recognition
of
what
was
generous
and
manly
in
his
nature
of
what
was
faulty
in
her
own
came
to
her
aid
she
would
not
tell
him
in
this
cold
abrupt
fashion
the
story
of
a
sister
s
sordid
a
wife
s
meditated
irretrievable
alienation
the
day
must
yet
come
when
in
the
telling
she
could
rob
the
tale
of
its
keenest
sting
you
are
not
slanging
me
at
all
ted
she
said
gently
i
dare
say
my
conduct
appears
very
not
a
bit
of
it
answered
ted
stoutly
and
it
isn
t
farningham
i
am
thinking
of
so
much
as
you
she
has
her
brother
by
jove
that
man
has
eyes
like
a
hawk
did
you
know
that
needn
t
begin
to
wave
your
tail
you
young
tory
i
m
not
speaking
to
a
scar
on
his
left
paw
when
i
went
on
board
with
the
farninghams
the
doctor
came
up
to
me
much
friendlier
than
ever
before
i
can
t
help
thinking
he
had
some
sort
of
a
scunner
against
me
i
expect
it
was
seeing
me
talking
with
those
little
french
rips
when
you
were
lying
at
death
s
door
i
may
say
and
his
people
so
much
interested
in
you
they
used
to
send
him
to
inquire
sometimes
twice
a
day
i
wonder
though
he
didn
t
send
a
servant
he
must
have
taken
some
interest
on
his
own
account
but
he
always
seemed
as
if
he
would
sooner
keep
out
of
my
way
i
expect
he
thought
i
was
a
regular
fast
colonial
shows
how
careful
a
family
man
ought
to
be
i
ll
give
dick
a
good
jawing
about
it
yet
the
moment
langdale
came
up
this
young
made
a
tremendous
fuss
over
him
and
the
doctor
patted
him
and
talked
to
him
and
then
asked
him
for
his
scarred
paw
he
hasn
t
got
a
scar
said
i
my
wife
is
awfully
fond
of
that
scallawag
i
believe
he
s
always
been
more
looked
after
than
most
babies
yes
but
you
know
accidents
will
happen
to
the
dogs
said
the
doctor
i
believe
dustiefoot
had
an
accident
once
and
he
held
up
his
paw
and
sure
enough
there
is
the
mark
of
some
hurt
and
then
he
oh
ted
please
talk
of
something
else
said
stella
in
a
low
voice
touched
to
the
quick
with
this
careless
reminiscence
which
called
up
langdale
before
her
with
portraiture
and
colour
so
distinct
that
his
presence
seemed
to
haunt
the
room
all
right
answered
ted
placidly
i
wonder
though
you
didn
t
take
a
little
more
to
langdale
he
s
a
good
deal
like
some
of
those
fellows
in
front
of
your
i
don
t
believe
he
s
well
and
i
m
sure
stella
you
re
not
well
you
make
me
think
of
a
story
about
a
girl
you
told
me
long
ago
out
of
the
arabian
nights
i
don
t
remember
her
as
far
as
being
jolly
went
she
hadn
t
a
leg
to
stand
perhaps
it
was
the
orphan
who
was
quite
having
no
one
to
befriend
her
but
god
said
stella
with
a
faint
smile
oh
but
you
ve
got
far
more
to
befriend
you
than
that
returned
ted
with
unconscious
irreverence
but
i
ll
tell
you
what
stella
i
can
not
allow
you
to
be
poking
about
so
much
among
these
paupers
if
you
want
to
give
them
money
and
things
why
don
t
you
engage
some
competent
person
to
do
it
there
must
be
no
end
of
people
in
london
who
would
be
thankful
to
go
up
those
filthy
stairs
for
ten
shillings
a
day
or
do
you
think
one
can
do
everything
by
paying
money
ted
well
if
you
ask
me
i
never
thought
so
little
of
what
money
can
do
for
you
as
at
the
present
moment
look
here
as
he
spoke
ted
drew
a
pocketbook
out
of
his
breast
and
extracted
from
it
a
sheet
of
pale
pink
there
s
your
i
o
u
for
five
shillings
you
lost
to
me
at
euchre
last
december
that
night
after
i
got
home
i
said
to
larry
i
would
keep
this
bit
of
paper
till
everything
i
had
was
yours
and
now
it
is
and
yet
what
can
i
do
for
you
instead
of
flying
round
with
me
on
a
drag
with
proper
thoroughbred
horses
when
you
go
to
places
you
pick
out
a
hansom
with
the
screwiest
brute
you
can
see
so
that
you
may
go
slow
and
give
the
animal
a
spell
and
as
for
jewels
or
dresses
why
you
don
t
spend
nearly
your
own
money
and
you
ve
never
touched
any
of
your
well
now
i
am
going
to
ask
you
for
something
ted
is
all
you
have
really
mine
well
you
just
try
give
me
two
hundred
acres
of
but
the
whole
eighty
thousand

oh
that
is
too
much
give
me
two
hundred
acres
to
cut
up
into
little
good
lord
cried
ted
starting
up
with
such
a
look
of
horror
that
stella
fairly
smiled
but
you
re
only
making
game
of
me
stella
you
are
not
serious
and
is
it
some
of
the
paupers
you
want
to
put
there
he
cried
a
new
light
breaking
in
on
him
yes
some
of
the
people
who
come
up
from
the
country
hoping
to
get
but
to
put
them
on
strathhaye
stella
you
d
hate
the
look
of
them
in
no
time
oh
i
know
the
sort
of
farmers
they
make
with
awful
whales
of
horses
it
would
turn
a
fellow
sick
to
look
at
and
machinery
lying
about
without
even
a
shed
to
cover
it
no
no
stella
while
you
re
feeling
rather
low
and
going
to
church
so
much
you
fancy
you
would
like
to
do
this
but
to
fix
them
on
your
own
estate
instead
of
merinoes
you
d
be
disgusted
with
them
in
no
well
ted
you
are
only
judging
me
by
my
past
character
i
now
stella
don
t
begin
to
talk
of
yourself
in
such
a
fashion
your
character
indeed
why
haven
t
i
got
any
said
stella
smiling
once
again
not
in
that
way
you
hear
precious
little
about
people
s
characters
till
they
want
to
make
themselves
out
better
or
worse
than
they
are
when
you
want
to
speak
against
yourself
you
must
find
someone
that
knows
a
little
less
about
well
i
did
think
that
with
such
a
large
freehold
said
stella
slowly
now
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
ll
do
said
ted
suddenly
there
s
two
hundred
and
fifty
acres
of
good
agricultural
land
to
be
in
the
market
next
january
at
caradoc
about
fifteen
miles
away
from
strathhaye
i
ll
buy
it
for
you
every
acre
and
you
can
put
the
paupers
don
t
call
them
paupers
ted
the
schulz
family
in
berlin
and
others
like
them
in
london
thrifty
people
but
with
such
heavy
odds
against
them
that
they
must
go
to
the
wall
in
the
old
are
the
kind
of
families
we
should
it
was
a
long
time
since
ritchie
had
heard
stella
speak
with
so
much
animation
well
you
know
you
have
a
lot
of
money
of
your
own
to
do
what
you
like
with
he
began
it
will
be
an
investment
answered
stella
at
first
you
d
better
make
up
your
mind
to
lose
four
per
put
in
ted
no
i
won
t
lose
she
answered
confidently
you
see
you
don
t
know
the
people
that
just
reminds
me
of
what
you
said
once
when
you
were
telling
me
a
yarn
up
in
the
moreton
bay
at
fairacre
it
s
ages
ago
when
you
were
about
oh
ted
long
ago
as
that
well
it
s
eleven
years
ago
you
used
to
sit
in
the
fork
of
the
tree
with
your
back
against
the
trunk
with
a
book
and
i
would
tease
you
till
you
told
me
a
story
and
sometimes
you
would
make
it
so
creepy
i
was
sorry
i
asked
for
it
this
remember
it
well
because
it
was
a
week
before
your
father
died
said
ted
lowering
his
you
looked
down
towards
the
sea
and
you
said
there
was
a
ship
sailing
sailing
away
and
at
last
it
came
to
the
strangest
country
the
people
had
such
small
souls
that
at
the
day
of
judgment
they
couldn
t
be
found
the
lord
sent
squads
of
angels
to
look
for
them
but
not
one
could
they
fossick
out
and
there
the
skeletons
had
to
sit
each
on
its
own
grave
and
the
moonlight
playing
through
their
bones
that
was
the
only
light
and
not
a
blade
of
grass
or
a
drop
of
water
oh
ted
you
sure
i
told
you
all
that
said
stella
incredulously
why
who
else
could
ever
think
of
such
things
returned
ted
with
assured
confidence
there
was
never
a
sound
to
be
heard
but
when
a
big
went
rushing
over
the
was
all
valleys
full
of
graves
with
skeletons
sitting
on
them
waiting
for
the
souls
that
couldn
t
be
found
when
the
storms
blew
the
air
was
thick
with
bones
driven
here
and
there
and
at
last
left
in
heaps
to
get
together
as
well
as
they
could
they
used
to
be
so
tired
and
bruised
for
a
long
time
they
could
not
move
but
at
last
they
began
to
put
themselves
together
and
that
was
the
only
time
they
could
speak
you
have
taken
part
of
my
backbone
one
would
say
to
the
other
this
rib
doesn
t
belong
to
me
i
am
all
here
but
my
left
leg
who
has
got
my
skull
that
last
was
too
much
for
me
i
said
if
the
skull
was
missing
the
skeleton
couldn
t
speak
but
you
said
i
knew
nothing
about
the
country
i
had
never
been
there
and
not
only
so
but
the
bone
of
the
little
toe
could
speak
far
better
than
a
skull
that
put
the
kybosh
on
me
you
have
got
a
curious
memory
ted
said
stella
who
had
listened
with
languid
wonder
to
this
recital
you
never
seem
to
remember
much
of
books
you
no
but
you
tell
me
things
out
of
them
and
i
ll
remember
fast
enough
you
ll
have
to
come
back
to
that
a
school
with
only
me
is
that
a
letter
from
larry
yes
but
i
do
not
think
i
can
let
you
read
it
answered
stella
taking
it
up
she
was
thankful
that
she
had
resisted
the
impulse
which
had
come
over
her
in
connection
with
it
they
will
be
in
london
next
ted
it
may
seem
selfish
to
take
you
away
from
england
when
the
racing
season
is
at
its
height
but
i
want
to
get
away
before
larry
i
ll
take
you
wherever
you
wish
to
go
stella
answered
ted
all
these
months
i
ve
been
perfectly
sick
of
being
able
to
do
nothing
for
you
as
for
racing
i
told
you
more
than
a
year
ago
i
was
getting
full
up
of

fortnight
