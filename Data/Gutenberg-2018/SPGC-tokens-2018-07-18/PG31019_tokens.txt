lady

old
lady
ii
witnessed
by
two
iii
unexplained
iv
the
story
of
the
rippling
train
i
lady
farquhar
old
lady
a
true
ghost
story
one
that
was
a
woman
sir
but
rest
her
soul
she
dead
i
myself
have
never
seen
a
ghost
i
am
by
no
means
sure
that
i
wish
ever
to
do
so
but
i
have
a
friend
whose
experience
in
this
respect
has
been
less
limited
than
mine
till
lately
however
i
had
never
heard
the
details
of
lady
farquhar
adventure
though
the
fact
of
there
being
a
ghost
story
which
she
could
if
she
chose
relate
with
the
authority
of
an
had
been
more
than
once
alluded
to
before
me
living
at
extreme
ends
of
the
country
it
is
but
seldom
my
friend
and
i
are
able
to
meet
but
a
few
months
ago
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
spend
some
days
in
her
house
and
one
evening
our
conversation
happening
to
fall
on
the
subject
of
the
possibility
of
supernatural
visitations
or
communications
suddenly
what
i
had
heard
returned
to
my
memory
by
the
bye
i
exclaimed
we
need
not
go
far
for
an
authority
on
the
question
you
have
seen
a
ghost
yourself
margaret
i
remember
once
hearing
it
alluded
to
before
you
and
you
did
not
contradict
it
i
have
so
often
meant
to
ask
you
for
the
whole
story
do
tell
it
to
us
now
lady
farquhar
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
her
usually
bright
expression
grew
somewhat
graver
when
she
spoke
it
seemed
to
be
with
a
slight
effort
you
mean
what
they
all
call
the
story
of
old
lady
i
suppose
she
said
at
last
oh
yes
if
you
care
to
hear
it
i
will
tell
it
you
but
there
is
not
much
to
tell
remember
there
seldom
is
in
stories
of
the
kind
i
replied
genuine
ghost
stories
are
generally
abrupt
and
inconsequent
in
the
extreme
but
on
this
very
account
all
the
more
impressive
do
you
think
so
i
do
know
that
i
am
a
fair
judge
she
answered
indeed
she
went
on
rather
gravely
my
own
opinion
is
that
what
you
call
ghost
stories
are
very
seldom
told
at
all
how
do
you
mean
i
do
quite
understand
you
i
said
a
little
perplexed
by
her
words
and
tone
i
mean
she
replied
that
people
who
really
believe
they
have
come
in
contact
with
with
anything
of
that
kind
seldom
care
to
speak
about
it
do
you
really
think
so
do
you
mean
that
you
feel
so
yourself
i
exclaimed
with
considerable
surprise
i
had
no
idea
you
did
or
i
would
not
have
mentioned
the
subject
of
course
you
know
i
would
not
ask
you
to
tell
it
if
it
is
the
least
painful
or
disagreeable
to
you
to
talk
about
it
but
it
is
oh
no
it
is
not
nearly
so
bad
as
that
she
replied
with
a
smile
i
can
not
really
say
that
it
is
either
painful
or
disagreeable
to
me
to
recall
it
for
i
can
not
exactly
apply
either
of
those
words
to
the
thing
itself
all
that
i
feel
is
a
sort
of
shrinking
from
the
subject
strong
enough
to
prevent
my
ever
alluding
to
it
lightly
or
carelessly
of
all
things
i
should
dislike
to
have
a
joke
made
of
it
but
with
you
i
have
no
fear
of
that
and
you
trust
me
do
you
i
do
mean
as
to
truthfulness
only
but
you
do
think
me
deficient
in
common
sense
and
not
morbid
or
very
apt
to
be
run
away
with
by
my
imagination
not
the
sort
of
person
one
would
pick
out
as
likely
to
see
ghosts
i
replied
certainly
not
you
are
far
too
sensible
and
healthy
and
vigorous
i
ca
very
readily
fancy
you
the
victim
of
delusion
of
any
kind
but
as
to
ghosts
are
they
or
are
they
not
delusions
there
lies
the
question
tell
us
your
experience
of
them
any
way
so
she
told
the
story
i
had
asked
for
told
it
in
the
simplest
language
and
with
no
exaggeration
of
tone
or
manner
as
we
sat
there
in
her
pretty
our
chairs
drawn
close
to
the
fire
for
it
was
christmas
time
and
the
weather
was
seasonable
two
or
three
of
margaret
children
were
in
the
room
though
not
within
hearing
of
us
all
looked
bright
and
cheerful
nothing
mysterious
yet
notwithstanding
the
total
deficiency
of
ghostly
accessories
the
story
impressed
me
vividly
it
was
early
in
the
spring
of
that
it
happened
began
lady
farquhar
i
never
forget
the
year
for
a
reason
i
will
tell
you
afterwards
it
is
fully
fifteen
years
ago
now
a
long
time
but
i
am
still
quite
able
to
recall
the
this
strange
adventure
of
mine
left
on
me
though
a
few
details
and
particulars
have
grown
confused
and
misty
i
think
it
often
happens
so
when
one
tries
as
it
were
hard
to
be
accurate
and
unexaggerated
in
telling
over
anything
very
honesty
is
against
one
i
have
not
told
it
over
many
times
but
each
time
it
seems
more
difficult
to
tell
it
quite
exactly
the
impression
left
at
the
time
was
so
powerful
that
i
have
always
dreaded
incorrectness
or
exaggeration
creeping
in
it
reminds
me
too
of
the
curious
way
in
which
a
familiar
word
or
name
grows
distorted
and
then
cloudy
and
strange
if
one
looks
at
it
too
long
or
thinks
about
it
too
much
but
i
must
get
on
with
my
story
well
to
begin
again
in
the
winter
of
we
were
living
my
mother
my
sisters
and
i
that
is
and
from
time
to
time
my
brother
in
or
rather
near
a
quiet
little
village
on
the
south
coast
of
ireland
we
had
gone
there
before
the
worst
of
the
winter
began
at
home
for
the
sake
of
my
health
i
had
not
been
as
well
as
usual
for
some
time
this
was
greatly
owing
i
believe
to
my
having
lately
endured
unusual
anxiety
of
mind
and
my
dear
mother
dreaded
the
cold
weather
for
me
and
determined
to
avoid
it
i
say
that
i
had
had
unusual
anxiety
to
bear
still
it
was
not
of
a
kind
to
render
me
morbid
or
fanciful
and
what
is
even
more
to
the
point
my
mind
was
perfectly
free
from
prepossession
or
association
in
connection
with
the
place
we
were
living
in
or
the
people
who
had
lived
there
before
us
i
simply
knew
nothing
whatever
of
these
people
and
i
had
no
sort
of
fancy
about
the
house
that
it
was
haunted
or
anything
of
that
kind
and
indeed
i
never
heard
that
it
thought
to
be
haunted
it
did
not
look
like
it
it
was
just
a
somewhat
country
or
rather
house
furnished
with
the
exception
of
one
room
in
an
ordinary
enough
modern
style
the
exception
was
a
small
room
on
the
bedroom
floor
which
though
not
locked
off
that
is
to
say
the
key
was
left
in
the
lock
outside
was
not
given
up
for
our
use
as
it
was
crowded
with
musty
old
furniture
packed
closely
together
and
all
of
a
fashion
many
many
years
older
than
that
of
the
contents
of
the
rest
of
the
house
i
remember
some
of
the
pieces
of
furniture
still
though
i
think
i
was
only
once
or
twice
in
the
room
all
the
time
we
were
there
there
were
two
or
three
cabinets
or
bureaux
there
was
a
regular
bedstead
with
the
gloomy
curtains
still
hanging
round
it
and
ever
so
many
chairs
and
rickety
tables
and
i
rather
think
in
one
corner
there
was
a
spinet
but
there
was
nothing
particularly
curious
or
attractive
and
we
never
thought
of
meddling
with
the
things
or
about
as
girls
sometimes
do
for
we
always
thought
it
was
by
mistake
that
this
room
had
not
been
locked
off
altogether
so
that
no
one
should
meddle
with
anything
in
it
we
had
rented
the
house
for
six
months
from
a
captain
marchmont
a
officer
naval
or
military
i
do
know
which
for
we
never
saw
him
and
all
the
negotiations
were
managed
by
an
agent
captain
marchmont
and
his
family
as
a
rule
lived
at
ballyreina
all
the
year
round
they
found
it
cheap
and
healthy
i
suppose
but
this
year
they
had
preferred
to
pass
the
winter
in
some
livelier
neighbourhood
and
they
were
very
glad
to
let
the
house
it
never
occurred
to
us
to
doubt
our
landlord
being
the
owner
of
it
it
was
not
till
some
time
after
we
left
that
we
learned
that
he
himself
was
only
a
tenant
though
a
tenant
of
long
standing
there
were
no
people
about
to
make
friends
with
or
to
hear
local
gossip
from
there
were
no
gentry
within
visiting
distance
and
if
there
had
been
we
should
hardly
have
cared
to
make
friends
for
so
short
a
time
as
we
were
to
be
there
the
people
of
the
village
were
mostly
fishermen
and
their
families
there
were
so
many
of
them
we
never
got
to
know
any
specially
the
doctor
and
the
priest
and
the
protestant
clergyman
were
all
newcomers
and
all
three
very
uninteresting
the
clergyman
used
to
dine
with
us
sometimes
as
my
brother
had
had
some
sort
of
introduction
to
him
when
we
came
to
ballyreina
but
we
never
heard
anything
about
the
place
from
him
he
was
a
great
talker
too
i
am
sure
he
would
have
told
us
anything
he
knew
in
short
there
was
nothing
romantic
or
suggestive
either
about
our
house
or
the
village
but
we
did
care
you
see
we
had
gone
there
simply
for
rest
and
quiet
and
pure
air
and
we
got
what
we
wanted
well
one
evening
about
the
middle
of
march
i
was
up
in
my
room
dressing
for
dinner
and
just
as
i
had
about
finished
dressing
my
sister
helen
came
in
i
remember
her
saying
as
she
came
in
you
ready
yet
maggie
are
you
making
yourself
extra
smart
for
mr
conroy
conroy
was
the
clergyman
he
was
dining
with
us
that
night
and
then
helen
looked
at
me
and
found
fault
with
me
half
in
fun
of
course
for
not
having
put
on
a
prettier
dress
i
remember
i
said
it
was
good
enough
for
conroy
who
was
no
favourite
of
mine
but
helen
was
satisfied
till
i
agreed
to
wear
a
bright
scarlet
of
hers
and
she
ran
off
to
her
room
to
fetch
it
i
followed
her
almost
immediately
her
room
and
mine
i
must
by
the
bye
explain
were
at
extreme
ends
of
a
passage
several
yards
in
length
there
was
a
wall
on
one
side
of
this
passage
and
a
balustrade
overlooking
the
staircase
on
the
other
my
room
was
at
the
end
nearest
the
top
of
the
staircase
there
were
no
doors
along
the
passage
leading
to
helen
room
but
just
beside
her
door
at
the
end
was
that
of
the
unused
room
i
told
you
of
filled
with
the
old
furniture
the
passage
was
lighted
from
above
by
a
skylight
i
mean
it
was
by
no
means
dark
or
shadowy
and
on
the
evening
i
am
speaking
of
it
was
still
clear
daylight
we
dined
early
at
ballyreina
i
do
think
it
could
have
been
more
than
a
quarter
to
five
when
helen
came
into
my
room
well
as
i
was
saying
i
followed
her
almost
immediately
so
quickly
that
as
i
came
out
of
my
room
i
was
in
time
to
catch
sight
of
her
as
she
ran
along
the
passage
and
to
see
her
go
into
her
own
room
just
as
i
lost
sight
of
her
i
was
coming
along
more
deliberately
you
understand
suddenly
how
or
when
exactly
i
can
not
tell
i
perceived
figure
walking
along
the
passage
in
front
of
me
it
was
a
woman
a
little
thin
woman
but
though
she
had
her
back
to
me
something
in
her
gait
told
me
she
was
not
young
she
seemed
a
little
bent
and
walked
feebly
i
can
remember
her
dress
even
now
with
the
most
perfect
distinctness
she
had
a
gown
of
gray
clinging
stuff
rather
scanty
in
the
skirt
and
one
of
those
funny
little
black
shawls
with
a
border
that
you
seldom
see
nowadays
do
you
know
the
kind
i
mean
it
was
a
narrow
border
and
there
was
a
short
tufty
black
fringe
below
the
border
and
she
had
a
gray
poke
bonnet
a
bonnet
made
of
silk
on
to
a
large
stiff
frame
bonnets
they
used
to
be
called
i
took
in
all
these
details
of
her
dress
in
a
moment
and
even
in
that
moment
i
noticed
too
that
the
materials
of
her
clothes
looked
though
so
plain
and
but
somehow
my
first
impulse
when
i
saw
her
was
to
call
out
is
that
you
fraser
was
my
mother
maid
she
was
a
young
woman
and
not
the
least
like
the
person
in
front
of
me
but
i
think
a
vague
idea
rushed
across
my
mind
that
it
might
be
fraser
dressed
up
to
trick
the
other
servants
but
the
figure
took
no
notice
of
my
exclamation
it
or
she
walked
on
quietly
not
even
turning
her
head
round
in
the
least
she
walked
slowly
down
the
passage
seemingly
quite
unconscious
of
my
presence
and
to
my
extreme
amazement
disappeared
into
the
unused
room
the
key
as
i
think
i
told
you
was
always
turned
in
the
lock
that
is
to
say
the
door
was
locked
but
the
key
was
left
in
it
but
the
old
woman
did
not
seem
to
me
to
unlock
the
door
or
even
to
turn
the
handle
there
seemed
no
obstacle
in
her
way
she
just
quietly
as
it
were
walked
the
door
even
by
this
time
i
hardly
think
i
felt
what
i
had
seen
had
passed
too
quickly
for
me
as
yet
to
realise
its
strangeness
still
i
felt
perplexed
and
vaguely
uneasy
and
i
hurried
on
to
my
sister
room
she
was
standing
by
the
searching
for
the
ribbon
i
think
i
must
have
looked
startled
for
before
i
could
speak
she
called
out
whatever
is
the
matter
with
you
you
look
as
if
you
were
going
to
faint
i
asked
her
if
she
had
heard
anything
though
it
was
an
inconsistent
question
for
to
ears
there
had
been
no
sound
at
all
helen
answered
a
moment
before
i
came
into
the
room
she
had
heard
the
lock
of
the
so
we
called
it
door
click
and
had
wondered
what
i
could
be
going
in
there
for
then
i
told
her
what
i
had
seen
she
looked
a
little
startled
but
declared
it
must
have
been
one
of
the
servants
it
is
a
trick
of
the
servants
i
answered
should
be
exposed
and
when
helen
offered
to
search
through
the
with
me
at
once
i
was
very
ready
to
agree
to
it
i
was
so
satisfied
of
the
reality
of
what
i
had
seen
that
i
declared
to
helen
that
the
old
woman
whoever
she
was
be
in
the
room
it
stood
to
reason
that
having
gone
in
she
must
still
be
there
as
she
could
not
possibly
have
come
out
again
without
our
knowledge
so
plucking
up
our
courage
we
went
to
the
door
i
felt
so
certain
that
but
a
moment
before
some
one
had
opened
it
that
i
took
hold
of
the
knob
quite
confidently
and
turned
it
just
as
one
always
does
to
open
a
door
the
handle
turned
but
the
door
did
not
yield
i
stooped
down
to
see
why
the
reason
was
plain
enough
the
door
was
still
locked
locked
as
usual
and
the
key
in
the
lock
then
helen
and
i
stared
at
each
other
mind
was
evidently
recurring
to
the
sound
she
had
heard
what
began
to
think
i
can
hardly
put
in
words
but
when
we
got
over
this
new
start
a
little
we
set
to
work
to
search
the
room
as
we
had
intended
and
we
searched
it
thoroughly
i
assure
you
we
dragged
the
old
tables
and
chairs
out
of
their
corners
and
peeped
behind
the
cabinets
and
chests
of
drawers
where
no
one
have
been
hidden
then
we
climbed
upon
the
old
bedstead
and
shook
the
curtains
till
we
were
covered
with
dust
and
then
we
crawled
under
the
valances
and
came
out
looking
like
sweeps
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
found
there
was
certainly
in
the
room
and
by
all
appearances
no
one
could
have
been
there
for
weeks
we
had
hardly
time
to
make
ourselves
fit
to
be
seen
when
the
rang
and
we
had
to
hurry
downstairs
as
we
ran
down
we
agreed
to
say
nothing
of
what
had
happened
before
the
servants
but
after
dinner
in
the
we
told
our
story
my
mother
and
brother
listened
to
it
attentively
said
it
was
very
strange
and
owned
themselves
as
puzzled
as
we
conroy
of
course
laughed
uproariously
and
made
us
dislike
him
more
than
ever
after
he
had
gone
we
talked
it
over
again
among
ourselves
and
my
mother
who
hated
mysteries
did
her
utmost
to
explain
what
i
had
seen
in
a
natural
way
was
i
sure
it
was
not
only
helen
herself
i
had
seen
after
fancying
she
had
reached
her
own
room
was
i
quite
certain
it
was
not
fraser
after
all
carrying
a
shawl
perhaps
which
made
her
look
different
might
it
not
have
been
this
that
or
the
other
it
was
no
use
nothing
could
convince
me
that
i
had
seen
what
i
had
seen
and
though
to
satisfy
my
mother
we
fraser
it
was
with
no
result
in
the
way
of
explanation
fraser
evidently
knew
nothing
that
could
throw
light
on
it
and
she
was
quite
certain
that
at
the
time
i
had
seen
the
figure
both
the
other
servants
were
downstairs
in
the
kitchen
fraser
was
perfectly
trustworthy
we
warned
her
not
to
frighten
the
others
by
speaking
about
the
affair
at
all
but
we
could
not
leave
off
speaking
about
it
among
ourselves
we
spoke
about
it
so
much
for
the
next
few
days
that
at
last
my
mother
lost
patience
and
forbade
us
to
mention
it
again
at
least
she
to
lose
patience
in
reality
i
believe
she
put
a
stop
to
the
discussion
because
she
thought
it
might
have
a
bad
effect
on
our
nerves
on
mine
especially
for
i
found
out
afterwards
that
in
her
anxiety
she
even
went
the
length
of
writing
about
it
to
our
old
doctor
at
home
and
that
it
was
by
his
advice
she
acted
in
forbidding
us
to
talk
about
it
any
more
poor
dear
mother
i
do
know
that
it
was
very
sound
advice
one
mind
often
runs
all
the
more
on
things
one
is
forbidden
to
mention
it
certainly
was
so
with
me
for
i
thought
over
my
strange
adventure
almost
incessantly
for
some
days
after
we
left
off
talking
about
it
here
margaret
paused
and
is
that
all
i
asked
feeling
a
little
disappointed
i
think
at
the
unsatisfactory
ending
to
the
true
ghost
story
all
repeated
lady
farquhar
rousing
herself
as
if
from
a
reverie
all
oh
dear
no
i
have
sometimes
wished
it
had
been
for
i
think
what
i
have
told
you
would
have
left
any
impression
on
me
all
oh
dear
no
i
am
only
at
the
beginning
of
my
story
so
we
resettled
ourselves
again
to
listen
and
lady
farquhar
continued
for
some
days
as
i
said
i
could
not
help
thinking
a
good
deal
of
the
mysterious
old
woman
i
had
seen
still
i
assure
you
i
was
not
exactly
frightened
i
was
more
puzzled
puzzled
and
annoyed
at
not
being
able
in
any
way
to
explain
the
mystery
but
by
ten
days
or
so
from
the
time
of
my
first
adventure
the
impression
was
beginning
to
fade
indeed
the
day
before
the
evening
i
am
now
going
to
tell
you
of
i
do
think
my
old
lady
had
been
in
my
head
at
all
it
was
filled
with
other
things
so
do
you
see
the
explaining
away
what
i
saw
as
entirely
a
delusion
a
fancy
of
my
own
brain
has
a
weak
point
here
for
it
been
all
my
fancy
it
would
surely
have
happened
at
the
time
my
mind
really
was
full
of
the
subject
though
even
if
it
had
been
so
it
would
not
have
explained
the
curious
coincidence
of
my
with
facts
actual
facts
of
which
at
the
time
i
was
in
complete
ignorance
it
must
have
been
just
about
ten
days
after
my
first
adventure
that
i
happened
one
evening
between
eight
and
nine
to
be
alone
upstairs
in
my
own
room
we
had
dined
at
five
as
usual
and
had
been
sitting
together
in
the
since
dinner
but
i
had
made
some
little
excuse
for
coming
upstairs
the
truth
being
that
i
wanted
to
be
alone
to
read
over
a
letter
which
the
evening
post
there
actually
was
an
evening
post
at
ballyreina
had
brought
me
and
which
i
had
only
had
time
to
glance
at
it
was
a
very
welcome
and
letter
and
the
reading
of
it
made
me
very
happy
i
do
think
i
had
felt
so
happy
all
the
months
we
had
been
in
ireland
as
i
was
feeling
that
evening
do
you
remember
my
saying
i
never
forget
the
year
all
this
happened
it
was
the
year
and
the
month
of
march
the
spring
following
that
first
dreadful
winter
and
news
had
just
come
to
england
of
the
czar
death
and
every
one
was
wondering
and
hoping
and
fearing
what
would
be
the
results
of
it
i
had
no
very
near
friends
in
the
crimea
but
of
course
like
every
one
else
i
was
intensely
interested
in
all
that
was
going
on
and
in
this
letter
of
mine
there
was
told
the
news
of
the
czar
death
and
there
was
a
good
deal
of
comment
upon
it
i
had
read
my
letter
more
than
once
i
daresay
and
was
beginning
to
think
i
must
go
down
to
the
others
in
the
but
the
fire
in
my
bedroom
was
very
tempting
it
was
burning
so
brightly
that
though
i
had
got
up
from
my
chair
by
the
fireside
to
leave
the
room
and
had
blown
out
the
candle
i
had
read
my
letter
by
i
yielded
to
the
inclination
to
sit
down
again
for
a
minute
or
two
to
dream
pleasant
dreams
and
think
pleasant
thoughts
at
last
i
rose
and
turned
towards
the
door
it
was
standing
wide
open
by
the
bye
but
i
had
hardly
made
a
step
from
the
fireplace
when
i
was
stopped
short
by
what
i
saw
again
the
same
strange
indefinable
feeling
of
not
knowing
how
or
when
it
had
come
there
again
the
same
painful
sensation
of
perplexity
not
yet
amounting
to
fear
as
to
whom
or
what
it
was
i
saw
before
me
the
room
you
must
understand
was
perfectly
flooded
with
the
firelight
except
in
the
corners
perhaps
every
object
was
as
distinct
as
possible
and
the
object
i
was
staring
at
was
not
in
a
corner
but
standing
there
right
before
me
between
me
and
the
open
door
alas
in
the
middle
of
the
room
it
was
the
old
woman
again
but
this
time
with
her
face
towards
me
with
a
look
upon
it
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
she
were
conscious
of
my
presence
it
is
very
difficult
to
tell
over
thoughts
and
feelings
that
can
hardly
have
taken
any
time
to
pass
or
that
passed
almost
simultaneously
my
first
impulse
this
time
was
as
it
had
been
the
first
time
i
saw
her
to
explain
in
some
natural
way
the
presence
before
me
i
think
this
says
something
for
my
common
sense
does
it
not
my
mind
did
not
readily
desert
matters
of
fact
you
see
i
did
not
think
of
fraser
this
time
but
the
thought
went
through
my
mind
must
be
some
friend
of
the
servants
who
comes
in
to
see
them
of
an
evening
perhaps
they
have
sent
her
up
to
look
at
my
fire
so
at
first
i
looked
up
at
her
with
simple
inquiry
but
as
i
looked
my
feelings
changed
i
realised
that
this
was
the
same
being
who
had
appeared
so
mysteriously
once
before
i
recognised
every
detail
of
her
dress
i
even
noticed
it
more
acutely
than
the
first
time
for
instance
i
recollect
observing
that
here
and
there
the
short
tufty
fringe
of
her
shawl
was
stuck
together
instead
of
hanging
smoothly
and
evenly
all
round
i
looked
up
at
her
face
i
can
not
now
describe
the
features
beyond
saying
that
the
whole
face
was
refined
and
pleasing
and
that
in
the
expression
there
was
certainly
nothing
to
alarm
or
repel
it
was
rather
wistful
and
beseeching
the
look
in
the
eyes
anxious
the
lips
slightly
parted
as
if
she
were
on
the
point
of
speaking
i
have
since
thought
that
if
had
spoken
if
i
have
spoken
for
i
did
make
one
effort
to
do
so
but
no
audible
words
would
come
at
my
bidding
the
spell
that
bound
the
poor
soul
this
mysterious
wanderer
from
some
shadowy
borderland
between
life
and
death
might
have
been
broken
and
the
message
that
i
now
believe
burdened
her
delivered
sometimes
i
wish
i
could
have
done
it
but
then
again
oh
no
a
from
those
unreal
lips
would
have
been
too
awful
flesh
and
blood
could
not
have
stood
it
for
another
instant
i
kept
my
eyes
fixed
upon
her
without
moving
then
there
came
over
me
at
last
with
an
awful
thrill
a
sort
of
suffocating
gasp
of
horror
the
consciousness
the
actual
realisation
of
the
fact
that
this
before
me
this
was
no
living
human
being
no
dweller
in
our
familiar
world
not
a
woman
but
a
ghost
oh
it
was
an
awful
moment
i
pray
that
i
may
never
again
endure
another
like
it
there
is
something
so
indescribably
frightful
in
the
feeling
that
we
are
on
the
verge
of
being
tried
what
we
can
bear
that
ordinary
conditions
are
slipping
away
from
under
us
that
in
another
moment
reason
or
life
itself
must
snap
with
the
strain
and
all
these
feelings
i
then
underwent
at
last
i
moved
moved
backwards
from
the
figure
i
dared
not
attempt
to
her
yet
i
could
not
at
first
turn
away
from
her
i
stepped
backwards
facing
her
still
as
i
did
so
till
i
was
close
to
the
fireplace
then
i
turned
sharply
from
her
sat
down
again
on
the
low
chair
still
standing
by
the
hearth
resolutely
forcing
myself
to
gaze
into
the
fire
which
was
blazing
cheerfully
though
conscious
all
the
time
of
a
terrible
fascination
urging
me
to
look
round
again
to
the
middle
of
the
room
gradually
however
now
that
i
no
longer
her
i
began
a
little
to
recover
myself
i
tried
to
bring
my
sense
and
reason
to
bear
on
the
matter
being
i
said
to
myself
and
whatever
she
is
me
i
am
under
protection
as
much
at
this
moment
as
at
any
moment
of
my
life
all
creatures
even
disembodied
spirits
if
there
be
such
and
this
among
them
if
it
be
one
are
under
his
control
should
i
be
afraid
i
am
being
tried
my
courage
and
trust
are
being
tried
to
the
utmost
let
me
prove
them
let
me
keep
my
own
by
mastering
this
cowardly
unreasonable
terror
and
after
a
time
i
began
to
feel
stronger
and
surer
of
myself
then
i
rose
from
my
seat
and
turned
towards
the
door
again
and
oh
the
relief
of
seeing
that
the
way
was
clear
my
terrible
visitor
had
disappeared
i
hastened
across
the
room
i
passed
the
few
steps
of
passage
that
lay
between
my
door
and
the
staircase
and
hurried
down
the
first
flight
in
a
sort
of
suppressed
agony
of
eagerness
to
find
myself
again
safe
in
the
living
human
companionship
of
my
mother
and
sisters
in
the
cheerful
below
but
my
trial
was
not
yet
over
indeed
it
seemed
to
me
afterwards
that
it
had
only
now
reached
its
height
perhaps
the
strain
on
my
nervous
system
was
now
beginning
to
tell
and
my
powers
of
endurance
were
all
but
exhausted
i
can
not
say
if
it
was
so
or
not
i
can
only
say
that
my
agony
of
terror
of
horror
of
absolute
was
far
past
describing
in
words
when
just
as
i
reached
the
little
landing
at
the
foot
of
the
first
short
staircase
and
was
on
the
point
of
running
down
the
longer
flight
still
before
me
i
saw
coming
slowly
the
steps
as
if
to
meet
me
the
ghostly
figure
of
the
old
woman
it
was
too
much
i
was
reckless
by
this
time
i
could
not
stop
i
rushed
down
the
staircase
brushing
past
the
figure
as
i
went
i
use
the
word
intentionally
i
did
past
her
i
her
this
part
of
my
experience
was
i
believe
quite
at
variance
with
the
sensations
of
orthodox
but
i
am
really
telling
you
all
i
was
conscious
of
then
i
hardly
remember
anything
more
my
agony
broke
out
at
last
in
a
loud
shrill
cry
and
i
suppose
i
fainted
i
only
know
that
when
i
recovered
my
senses
i
was
in
the
on
the
sofa
surrounded
by
my
terrified
mother
and
sisters
but
it
was
not
for
some
time
that
i
could
find
voice
or
courage
to
tell
them
what
had
happened
to
me
for
several
days
i
was
on
the
brink
of
a
serious
illness
and
for
long
afterwards
i
could
not
endure
to
be
left
alone
even
in
the
broadest
daylight
lady
farquhar
stopped
i
fancied
however
from
her
manner
that
there
was
more
to
tell
so
i
said
nothing
and
in
a
minute
or
two
she
went
on
speaking
we
did
not
stay
long
at
ballyreina
after
this
i
was
not
sorry
to
leave
it
but
still
before
the
time
came
for
us
to
do
so
i
had
begun
to
recover
from
the
most
painful
part
of
the
impression
left
upon
me
by
my
strange
adventure
and
when
i
was
at
home
again
far
from
the
place
where
it
had
happened
i
gradually
lost
the
feeling
of
horror
altogether
and
remembered
it
only
as
a
very
curious
and
inexplicable
experience
now
and
then
even
i
did
not
shrink
from
talking
about
it
generally
i
think
with
a
vague
hope
that
somehow
some
time
or
other
light
might
be
thrown
upon
it
not
that
i
ever
expected
or
could
have
believed
it
possible
that
the
supernatural
character
of
the
adventure
could
be
explained
away
but
i
always
had
a
misty
fancy
that
sooner
or
later
i
should
find
out
about
my
old
lady
as
we
came
to
call
her
who
she
had
been
and
what
her
history
was
and
did
you
i
asked
eagerly
yes
i
did
margaret
answered
to
some
extent
at
least
i
learnt
the
explanation
of
what
i
had
seen
this
was
how
it
was
nearly
a
year
after
we
had
left
ireland
i
was
staying
with
one
of
my
aunts
and
one
evening
some
young
people
who
were
also
visiting
her
began
to
talk
about
ghosts
and
my
aunt
who
had
heard
something
of
the
story
from
my
mother
begged
me
to
tell
it
i
did
so
just
as
i
have
now
told
it
to
you
when
i
had
finished
an
elderly
lady
who
was
present
and
who
had
listened
very
attentively
surprised
me
a
little
by
asking
the
name
of
the
house
where
it
happened
it
ballyreina
she
said
i
answered
wondering
how
she
knew
it
for
i
had
not
mentioned
it
i
can
tell
you
whom
you
saw
she
exclaimed
must
have
been
one
of
the
old
miss
fitzgeralds
the
eldest
one
the
description
suits
her
exactly
i
was
quite
puzzled
we
had
never
heard
of
any
fitzgeralds
at
ballyreina
i
said
so
to
the
lady
and
asked
her
to
explain
what
she
meant
she
told
me
all
she
knew
it
appeared
there
had
been
a
family
of
that
name
for
many
generations
at
ballyreina
once
upon
a
time
a
once
upon
a
time
the
fitzgeralds
had
been
great
and
rich
but
gradually
one
misfortune
after
another
had
brought
them
down
in
the
world
and
at
the
time
my
informant
heard
about
them
the
only
representatives
of
the
old
family
were
three
maiden
ladies
already
elderly
gordon
the
lady
who
told
me
all
this
had
met
them
once
and
had
been
much
impressed
by
what
she
heard
of
them
they
had
got
poorer
and
poorer
till
at
last
they
had
to
give
up
the
struggle
and
sell
or
let
on
a
long
lease
their
dear
old
home
ballyreina
they
were
too
proud
to
remain
in
their
own
country
after
this
and
spent
the
rest
of
their
lives
on
the
continent
wandering
about
from
place
to
place
the
most
curious
part
of
it
was
that
nearly
all
their
wandering
was
actually
they
were
too
poor
to
afford
to
travel
much
in
the
usual
way
and
yet
once
torn
from
their
old
associations
the
travelling
mania
seized
them
they
seemed
absolutely
unable
to
rest
so
on
foot
and
speaking
not
a
word
of
any
language
but
their
own
these
three
desolate
sisters
journeyed
over
a
great
part
of
the
continent
they
visited
most
of
the
principal
towns
and
were
well
known
in
several
i
daresay
they
are
still
remembered
at
some
of
the
places
they
used
to
stay
at
though
never
for
more
than
a
short
time
together
gordon
had
met
them
somewhere
i
forget
where
but
it
was
many
years
ago
since
then
she
had
never
heard
of
them
she
did
not
know
if
they
were
alive
or
dead
she
was
only
certain
that
the
description
of
my
old
lady
was
exactly
like
that
of
the
eldest
of
the
sisters
and
that
the
name
of
their
old
home
was
ballyreina
and
i
remember
her
saying
ever
a
heart
was
buried
in
a
house
it
was
that
of
poor
old
miss
fitzgerald
that
was
all
gordon
could
tell
me
continued
lady
farquhar
but
it
led
to
my
learning
a
little
more
i
told
my
brother
what
i
had
heard
he
used
often
at
that
time
to
be
in
ireland
on
business
and
to
satisfy
me
the
next
time
he
went
he
visited
the
village
of
ballyreina
again
and
in
one
way
and
another
he
found
out
a
few
particulars
the
house
you
remember
had
been
let
to
us
by
a
captain
marchmont
he
my
brother
discovered
was
not
the
owner
of
the
place
as
we
had
naturally
imagined
but
only
rented
it
on
a
very
long
lease
from
some
ladies
of
the
name
of
fitzgerald
it
had
been
in
captain
marchmont
possession
for
a
great
many
years
at
the
time
he
let
it
to
us
and
the
fitzgeralds
never
returning
there
even
to
visit
it
had
come
to
be
almost
forgotten
the
room
with
the
furniture
had
been
reserved
by
the
owners
of
the
place
to
leave
some
of
their
poor
old
treasures
in
relics
too
cumbersome
to
be
carried
about
with
them
in
their
strange
wanderings
but
too
precious
evidently
to
be
parted
with
we
of
course
never
could
know
what
may
not
have
been
hidden
away
in
some
of
the
queer
old
bureaux
i
told
you
of
family
papers
of
importance
perhaps
possibly
some
ancient
forgotten
in
the
confusion
of
their
a
lock
of
hair
or
a
withered
flower
perhaps
that
she
my
poor
old
lady
would
fain
have
clasped
in
her
hand
when
dying
or
have
had
buried
with
her
ah
yes
there
must
be
many
a
pitiful
old
story
that
is
never
told
lady
farquhar
stopped
and
gazed
dreamily
and
half
sadly
into
the
fire
then
miss
fitzgerald
dead
when
you
were
at
ballyreina
i
asked
margaret
looked
up
with
some
surprise
did
i
not
say
so
she
exclaimed
that
was
the
point
of
most
interest
in
what
my
brother
discovered
he
could
not
hear
the
exact
date
of
her
death
but
he
learnt
with
certainty
that
she
was
dead
had
died
at
geneva
i
think
some
time
in
the
month
of
march
in
the
previous
year
same
month
march
in
which
i
had
twice
seen
the
apparition
at
this
was
my
friend
ghost
story
ii
witnessed
by
two
but
you
will
keep
for
me
i
may
expect
you
at
the
usual
time
said
young
medway
to
her
old
friend
major
graham
as
she
shook
hands
with
him
certainly
i
kept
it
for
you
anne
i
always
said
i
should
he
answered
there
was
a
slight
touch
of
reproach
in
his
tone
she
lifted
her
eyes
for
half
a
second
to
his
face
as
if
she
would
have
said
more
but
after
all
it
was
only
the
words
then
till
that
were
uttered
quietly
and
almost
coldly
as
major
graham
left
the
room
i
ca
quite
make
anne
out
sometimes
he
said
to
himself
she
is
surely
cold
and
yet
i
know
she
has
real
affection
for
me
affection
i
suppose
ah
well
so
much
the
better
but
still
just
when
a
fellow
off
for
heaven
knows
how
long
and
and
altogether
it
does
seem
a
little
overstrained
she
ca
but
know
what
might
have
come
to
pass
had
we
not
been
separated
for
so
long
or
had
i
been
richer
and
i
do
think
she
could
have
been
exactly
in
love
with
medway
though
by
all
accounts
he
was
a
very
decent
fellow
she
is
so
inconsistent
too
she
seemed
really
disappointed
when
i
said
i
could
stay
but
i
a
fool
to
think
so
much
about
her
i
am
as
poor
as
ever
and
she
is
rich
a
fatal
barrier
it
a
good
thing
that
she
cold
and
that
i
have
plenty
of
other
matters
to
think
about
and
thus
congratulating
himself
he
dismissed
or
believed
that
he
dismissed
for
the
time
being
all
thought
of
anne
medway
from
his
mind
it
was
true
that
he
had
plenty
of
other
things
to
occupy
it
with
for
the
day
after
was
to
see
his
departure
from
england
for
an
indefinite
period
medway
meantime
sat
sadly
and
silently
in
the
library
where
major
graham
had
left
her
her
sweet
gray
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
fire
burning
brightly
and
cheerfully
in
the
waning
afternoon
light
but
she
saw
nothing
about
her
her
thoughts
were
busily
travelling
along
a
road
which
had
grown
very
familiar
to
them
of
late
she
was
recalling
all
her
past
intercourse
with
kenneth
graham
since
the
time
when
as
boy
and
girl
they
had
scarcely
remembered
that
they
were
not
real
brother
and
sister
all
through
the
pleasant
years
of
frequent
meeting
and
unconstrained
companionship
to
the
melancholy
day
when
kenneth
was
ordered
to
india
and
they
bade
each
other
a
long
farewell
that
was
ten
years
ago
now
and
they
had
not
met
again
till
last
spring
when
major
graham
returned
to
find
his
old
playfellow
a
widow
young
rich
and
lovely
but
lonely
in
a
sense
save
that
she
had
two
children
for
she
was
without
near
relations
and
was
not
the
type
of
woman
to
make
quick
or
numerous
friendships
the
renewal
of
the
old
relations
had
been
very
pleasant
only
too
pleasant
anne
had
of
late
begun
to
think
for
the
news
of
having
decided
to
go
abroad
again
had
made
her
realise
all
he
had
become
to
her
and
the
discovery
brought
with
it
sharp
misgiving
and
even
humiliation
he
does
not
care
for
me
not
as
i
do
for
him
she
was
saying
to
herself
as
she
sat
by
the
fire
there
would
have
been
no
necessity
for
his
leaving
england
again
had
he
done
so
it
can
not
be
because
i
am
rich
and
he
poor
surely
he
is
not
the
sort
of
man
to
let
such
a
mere
accident
as
that
stand
in
the
way
if
he
really
cared
for
me
no
it
is
that
he
does
not
care
for
me
except
as
a
sort
of
sister
but
still
he
said
he
had
kept
his
evening
for
me
at
least
he
cares
for
no
one
else
and
that
is
something
who
knows
perhaps
when
it
comes
to
really
saying
and
a
faint
flush
of
renewed
hope
rose
to
her
cheeks
and
a
brighter
gleam
to
her
eyes
the
door
opened
and
a
came
in
gently
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
apologetically
i
was
not
sure
if
major
graham
had
gone
will
he
be
here
to
dinner
if
you
please
not
ambrose
i
shall
be
quite
alone
but
major
graham
will
dine
here
he
does
not
leave
till
thursday
morning
very
well
said
ambrose
as
he
discreetly
retired
he
had
been
many
years
in
the
medway
household
he
had
respected
his
late
master
but
for
his
young
mistress
he
had
actual
affection
and
being
of
a
somewhat
sentimental
turn
he
had
constructed
for
her
benefit
a
very
pretty
little
romance
of
which
major
graham
was
the
hero
it
had
been
a
real
blow
to
poor
ambrose
to
learn
that
the
gentleman
in
question
was
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
without
any
sign
of
a
satisfactory
third
volume
and
he
was
rather
surprised
to
see
that
medway
seemed
this
evening
in
better
spirits
than
for
some
time
past
it
maybe
understood
between
themselves
he
reflected
as
he
made
his
way
back
to
his
own
quarters
i
sure
i
hope
so
for
he
a
real
gentleman
and
she
as
sweet
a
lady
as
ever
stepped
which
i
should
know
if
any
one
should
having
seen
her
patience
with
poor
master
as
was
really
called
for
through
his
long
illness
she
deserves
a
happy
ending
and
i
sure
i
hope
she
may
have
it
poor
lady
at
the
usual
time
meaning
five
or
thereabouts
brought
kenneth
for
his
last
visit
anne
had
been
expecting
him
with
an
anxiety
she
was
almost
ashamed
to
own
to
herself
yet
her
manner
was
so
calm
and
collected
that
no
one
could
have
guessed
the
tumult
of
hope
and
fear
of
wild
grief
at
his
leaving
of
intense
longing
for
any
word
were
it
but
a
word
to
prove
that
all
was
not
on
side
only
i
could
bear
his
being
away
for
years
even
if
he
thought
it
must
be
if
i
could
but
look
forward
if
i
had
the
to
look
forward
to
his
return
she
said
to
herself
but
the
evening
passed
on
tranquilly
and
to
all
appearance
pleasantly
without
a
word
or
look
more
than
might
have
been
between
real
brother
and
sister
kenneth
talked
kindly
tenderly
even
of
the
past
repeated
more
than
once
the
pleasure
it
had
been
to
him
to
find
again
his
old
friend
so
little
changed
so
completely
his
old
friend
still
the
boys
came
in
to
say
and
alas
my
lads
added
their
tall
friend
with
a
sigh
do
forget
me
quite
hal
and
charlie
and
do
let
your
mother
forget
me
either
eh
to
which
the
little
fellows
replied
solemnly
though
hardly
understanding
why
he
patted
their
curly
heads
with
a
lingering
hand
this
evening
or
why
mamma
looked
grave
at
his
words
and
anne
bore
it
all
without
flinching
and
smiled
and
talked
a
little
more
than
usual
perhaps
though
all
the
time
her
heart
was
bursting
and
kenneth
wondered
more
than
ever
if
after
all
she
much
heart
or
feeling
to
speak
of
you
will
be
bringing
back
a
wife
with
you
perhaps
she
said
once
shall
you
tell
her
about
your
sister
anne
kenneth
major
graham
looked
at
her
earnestly
for
half
an
instant
before
he
replied
but
anne
eyes
were
not
turned
towards
him
and
she
did
not
see
the
look
and
his
words
almost
belied
it
certainly
i
shall
tell
her
of
you
he
said
that
is
to
say
if
she
ever
comes
to
exist
at
present
few
things
are
less
probable
still
i
am
old
enough
now
never
to
say
je
ne
boirai
jamais
de
ton
but
he
went
on
i
may
return
to
find
married
again
anne
you
are
still
so
young
and
you
are
rather
lonely
no
said
anne
with
a
sudden
fierceness
which
he
had
never
seen
in
her
before
i
shall
marry
again
and
she
looked
him
full
in
the
face
with
a
strange
sparkle
in
her
eyes
which
almost
frightened
him
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
meekly
and
though
the
momentary
excitement
faded
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
and
anne
murmuring
some
excuse
was
again
her
quiet
self
this
momentary
glimpse
of
a
fierier
nature
beneath
gave
him
food
for
reflection
can
medway
have
not
been
what
he
seemed
on
the
surface
after
all
he
thought
to
himself
what
can
make
her
so
vindictive
against
matrimony
but
it
was
growing
late
and
kenneth
had
still
some
last
preparations
to
make
he
rose
slowly
and
reluctantly
from
his
chair
i
must
be
going
i
fear
he
said
anne
too
had
risen
they
stood
together
on
the
hearthrug
a
slight
very
slight
shiver
passed
through
her
kenneth
perceived
it
you
have
caught
cold
i
fear
he
said
kindly
for
the
room
was
warm
and
the
fire
was
burning
brightly
no
i
do
think
so
she
said
indifferently
you
will
write
to
me
now
and
then
he
said
next
oh
certainly
not
very
often
perhaps
she
replied
lightly
but
now
and
then
stay
and
she
turned
away
towards
her
tell
me
exactly
how
to
address
you
your
name
is
your
surname
enough
there
is
no
other
graham
in
your
regiment
no
he
said
absently
i
suppose
not
yes
just
my
name
and
the
regiment
and
allagherry
which
will
be
our
headquarters
you
might
if
you
were
amiable
you
might
write
to
galles
a
letter
overland
would
wait
for
me
there
for
it
was
the
days
of
long
sea
for
all
troops
to
india
anne
returned
to
her
former
position
on
the
hearthrug
the
moment
at
the
table
had
restored
her
courage
we
shall
see
she
said
smiling
again
then
kenneth
said
once
more
i
go
but
he
lingered
still
a
moment
you
must
have
caught
cold
anne
or
else
you
are
very
tired
you
are
so
white
and
from
his
height
above
her
though
anne
herself
was
tall
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
gently
and
as
a
brother
might
have
done
and
looked
down
at
her
pale
face
half
inquiringly
a
flush
of
colour
rose
for
an
instant
to
her
cheeks
the
temptation
was
strong
upon
her
to
throw
off
that
calmly
caressing
hand
but
she
resisted
it
and
looked
up
bravely
with
a
light
almost
of
defiance
in
her
eyes
i
am
perfectly
well
i
assure
you
but
perhaps
i
am
a
little
tired
i
suppose
it
is
getting
late
and
kenneth
stifled
a
sigh
of
scarcely
realised
disappointment
and
quickly
drew
back
his
hand
yes
it
is
late
i
am
very
thoughtless
then
anne
god
bless
you
and
before
she
had
time
to
answer
he
was
gone
ambrose
met
him
in
the
hall
with
officiousness
bringing
forward
his
coat
and
hat
his
presence
helped
to
dissipate
an
impulse
which
seized
major
graham
to
rush
upstairs
again
for
one
other
word
of
farewell
had
he
done
so
what
would
he
have
found
anne
sobbing
sobbing
with
the
terrible
intensity
of
a
nature
once
the
strain
is
withdrawn
sobbing
in
the
bitterness
of
her
grief
and
the
cruelty
of
her
mortification
with
but
one
consolation
at
least
he
does
not
despise
me
i
hid
it
well
she
whispered
to
herself
and
kenneth
graham
as
he
drove
away
in
his
cab
repeated
to
himself
she
is
cold
this
evening
particularly
and
yet
can
it
be
that
it
was
to
hide
any
other
feeling
if
i
thought
so
good
god
and
he
half
started
up
as
if
to
call
to
the
driver
but
sat
down
again
no
no
i
must
not
be
a
fool
i
could
not
stand
a
repulse
from
i
could
never
see
her
again
better
not
risk
it
and
then
i
am
so
poor
and
in
the
bustle
and
hurry
of
his
departure
he
tried
to
forget
the
wild
fancy
which
for
a
moment
had
disturbed
him
he
sailed
the
next
day
but
the
few
weeks
which
followed
passed
heavily
for
anne
it
was
a
dead
time
of
year
there
was
no
special
necessity
for
her
exerting
herself
to
throw
off
the
overwhelming
depression
and
strong
and
brave
as
she
was
she
allowed
herself
to
some
extent
to
yield
to
it
if
only
he
had
not
come
back
if
i
had
never
seen
him
again
she
repeated
to
herself
incessantly
i
had
in
a
sense
forgotten
him
the
thought
of
him
never
troubled
me
all
the
years
of
my
marriage
i
suppose
i
had
never
before
understood
how
i
care
how
i
wish
i
had
never
learnt
it
how
i
he
had
never
come
back
it
was
above
all
in
the
afternoons
the
dull
early
dark
autumn
afternoons
which
for
some
weeks
had
been
enlivened
by
the
expectation
sure
two
or
three
times
a
week
to
be
fulfilled
of
major
dropping
in
that
the
aching
pain
the
weary
longing
grew
so
bad
as
to
be
intolerable
how
shall
i
bear
it
said
poor
anne
to
herself
sometimes
it
is
so
wrong
so
unwomanly
so
selfish
too
when
i
think
of
my
children
how
much
i
have
to
be
thankful
for
why
should
i
ruin
my
life
by
crying
for
the
one
thing
that
is
not
for
me
it
is
worse
far
worse
than
if
he
had
died
had
i
known
that
he
had
loved
me
i
could
have
borne
his
death
it
seems
to
me
she
was
sitting
alone
one
afternoon
about
five
weeks
after
kenneth
had
left
thinking
sadly
over
and
over
the
same
thoughts
when
a
tap
at
the
door
made
her
look
up
come
in
she
said
though
the
tap
hardly
sounded
like
that
of
her
maid
and
no
one
else
was
likely
to
come
to
the
door
of
her
own
room
where
she
happened
to
be
come
in
and
somewhat
to
her
surprise
the
door
half
opened
and
old
ambrose
voice
replied
if
you
please
then
stopped
and
hesitated
come
in
she
repeated
with
a
touch
of
impatience
what
is
it
ambrose
where
is
seton
if
you
please
i
could
find
her
that
is
to
say
ambrose
went
on
nervously
i
did
look
for
her
i
thought
i
would
rather
tell
you
myself
you
must
be
startled
and
anne
at
this
looking
up
at
the
old
man
saw
that
he
was
pale
and
himself
but
it
it
major
graham
major
graham
repeated
anne
and
to
herself
her
voice
sounded
almost
like
a
scream
what
about
him
have
you
heard
anything
it
him
himself
said
ambrose
he
in
the
library
i
a
little
afraid
there
may
be
something
wrong
he
looked
so
strange
and
he
did
not
answer
when
i
spoke
to
him
but
he
in
the
library
anne
did
not
wait
to
hear
more
she
rushed
past
ambrose
across
the
landing
and
down
the
two
flights
of
steps
which
led
to
the
library
a
house
room
between
the
and
the
almost
before
his
voice
had
stopped
at
the
door
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
in
that
moment
all
sorts
of
wild
suppositions
flashed
across
her
brain
what
was
it
what
was
she
going
to
hear
had
kenneth
turned
back
out
to
india
for
sake
had
some
trouble
befallen
him
in
which
he
had
come
to
seek
her
sympathy
what
it
be
and
her
heart
beating
so
as
almost
to
suffocate
her
she
opened
the
door
yes
there
he
stood
on
the
hearthrug
as
she
had
last
seen
him
in
that
room
but
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
her
come
in
for
he
made
no
movement
towards
her
he
did
not
even
turn
his
head
in
her
direction
more
and
more
startled
and
perturbed
anne
hastily
went
up
to
him
kenneth
she
cried
what
is
it
what
is
the
matter
she
had
held
out
her
hand
as
she
hurried
towards
him
but
he
did
not
seem
to
see
it
he
stood
there
still
without
moving
his
face
slightly
turned
away
till
she
was
close
beside
him
kenneth
she
repeated
this
time
with
a
thrill
of
something
very
like
anguish
in
her
tone
what
is
the
matter
are
you
angry
with
me
speak
then
at
last
he
slowly
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
her
with
a
strange
anxiety
in
his
eyes
he
gazed
at
her
as
if
his
very
soul
were
in
that
gaze
and
lifting
his
right
hand
gently
laid
it
on
her
shoulder
as
he
had
done
the
evening
he
had
bidden
her
farewell
she
did
not
shrink
from
his
touch
but
strange
to
say
she
did
not
feel
it
and
some
indefinable
instinct
made
her
turn
her
eyes
away
from
his
and
glance
at
her
shoulder
but
even
as
she
did
so
she
saw
that
his
hand
was
no
longer
there
and
with
a
thrill
of
fear
she
exclaimed
again
kenneth
to
me
the
words
fell
on
empty
air
there
was
no
kenneth
beside
her
she
was
standing
on
the
hearthrug
alone
then
for
the
first
time
there
came
over
her
that
awful
chill
of
terror
so
often
described
yet
so
indescribable
to
all
but
the
few
who
have
felt
it
for
themselves
with
a
terrible
though
cry
anne
turned
towards
the
door
it
opened
before
she
reached
it
and
she
half
fell
into
old
ambrose
arms
fortunately
for
her
for
her
reason
perhaps
his
vague
misgiving
had
made
him
follow
her
though
of
what
he
was
afraid
he
could
scarcely
have
told
oh
oh
my
poor
lady
he
exclaimed
as
he
half
led
half
carried
her
back
to
her
own
room
what
is
it
has
he
gone
but
how
could
he
have
gone
i
was
close
by
i
never
saw
him
pass
he
is
not
there
has
not
been
said
poor
anne
trembling
and
clinging
to
her
old
servant
oh
ambrose
what
you
and
i
have
seen
was
no
living
kenneth
graham
no
living
man
at
all
ambrose
he
came
thus
to
say
to
me
he
is
dead
and
the
tears
burst
forth
as
she
spoke
and
anne
sobbed
convulsively
ambrose
looked
at
her
in
distress
and
consternation
past
words
then
at
last
he
found
courage
to
speak
my
poor
lady
he
repeated
it
must
be
so
i
misdoubted
me
and
i
did
not
know
why
he
did
not
ring
but
i
was
passing
by
the
door
and
something
a
sort
of
feeling
that
there
was
some
one
waiting
outside
made
me
open
it
to
my
astonishment
it
was
he
and
ambrose
himself
could
not
repress
a
sort
of
tremor
he
did
not
speak
but
seemed
to
pass
me
and
be
up
the
stairs
and
in
the
library
in
an
instant
and
then
not
knowing
what
to
do
i
went
to
your
room
forgive
me
if
i
did
wrong
no
no
said
anne
you
could
not
have
done
otherwise
ring
the
bell
ambrose
tell
seton
i
have
had
bad
news
and
that
you
think
it
has
upset
me
but
wait
at
the
door
till
she
comes
i
i
am
afraid
to
be
left
alone
and
medway
looked
so
deadly
pale
and
faint
that
when
seton
came
hurrying
in
answer
to
the
bell
it
needed
no
explanation
for
her
to
see
that
medway
was
really
seton
was
a
practical
person
and
the
bustle
of
attending
to
her
mistress
trying
to
make
her
warm
again
for
anne
was
shivering
with
cold
and
persuading
her
to
take
some
restoratives
effectually
drove
any
inquiry
as
to
the
cause
of
the
sudden
seizure
out
of
the
maid
head
and
by
the
time
medway
was
better
seton
had
invented
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
it
all
for
herself
you
need
a
change
it
too
dull
for
anybody
staying
in
town
at
this
season
and
it
beginning
to
tell
on
your
nerves
was
the
maid
idea
and
some
little
time
after
the
strange
occurrence
medway
was
persuaded
to
leave
town
for
the
country
but
not
till
she
had
seen
in
the
newspapers
the
fatal
paragraph
she
knew
would
sooner
or
later
be
there
the
announcement
of
the
death
on
board
her
majesty
troopship
a
few
days
before
reaching
the
cape
of
major
graham
of
the
regiment
she
had
known
it
she
said
to
herself
yet
when
she
saw
it
there
staring
her
in
the
face
she
realised
that
she
had
been
living
in
a
hope
which
she
had
not
allowed
to
herself
that
the
apparition
might
in
the
end
prove
capable
of
other
explanation
she
would
gladly
have
taken
refuge
in
the
thought
that
it
was
a
dream
an
optical
delusion
fed
of
her
fancy
incessantly
brooding
on
her
friend
and
on
his
last
visit
that
her
brain
was
in
some
way
disarranged
or
disturbed
anything
anything
would
have
been
welcome
to
her
but
against
all
such
was
opposed
the
fact
that
it
was
not
herself
alone
who
had
seen
kenneth
graham
that
fatal
afternoon
and
now
when
the
worst
was
certain
she
recognised
this
still
more
clearly
as
the
strongest
testimony
to
the
apparition
not
having
been
the
product
of
her
own
imagination
and
old
ambrose
her
sole
confidant
in
his
simple
way
agreed
with
her
if
i
had
not
seen
him
too
or
if
i
alone
had
seen
him
he
said
furtively
wiping
his
eyes
but
the
two
of
us
no
it
could
have
but
the
one
meaning
and
he
looked
sadly
at
the
open
newspaper
a
slight
discrimpancy
he
said
as
he
pointed
to
the
paragraph
our
major
graham
name
was
not
it
is
only
a
misprint
i
noticed
that
said
anne
wearily
no
ambrose
there
can
be
no
mistake
but
i
do
not
want
any
one
not
ever
to
hear
the
story
you
will
promise
me
that
ambrose
and
the
old
man
repeated
the
promise
he
had
already
given
there
was
another
discrimpancy
which
had
struck
anne
more
forcibly
but
which
she
refrained
from
mentioning
to
ambrose
it
can
mean
nothing
it
is
no
use
putting
it
into
his
head
she
said
to
herself
still
it
is
strange
the
facts
were
these
the
newspaper
gave
the
date
of
major
death
as
the
november
the
afternoon
on
which
he
had
appeared
to
medway
and
her
servant
was
that
of
the
this
left
no
possibility
of
calculating
that
the
vision
had
occurred
at
or
even
shortly
after
the
moment
of
the
death
it
must
be
a
mistake
in
the
announcement
anne
decided
and
then
she
gave
herself
up
to
the
acceptance
of
the
fact
kenneth
was
dead
life
held
no
individual
future
for
her
any
more
nothing
to
look
forward
to
no
hopes
however
tremblingly
admitted
that
some
day
he
might
return
and
return
to
discover
to
own
perhaps
to
himself
and
to
her
that
he
did
love
her
and
that
only
mistaken
pride
or
her
own
coldness
or
one
of
the
hundred
mistakes
or
perhapses
by
which
men
so
much
more
than
women
allow
to
drift
away
from
them
the
happiness
they
might
grasp
had
misled
and
withheld
him
no
all
was
over
henceforth
she
must
live
in
her
children
alone
in
the
interests
of
others
she
must
find
her
happiness
and
in
one
blessed
thought
said
the
poor
girl
for
she
was
little
more
even
at
the
first
to
herself
that
after
all
he
love
me
that
i
may
without
shame
say
so
in
my
heart
for
i
was
his
last
thought
it
was
it
must
have
been
to
tell
me
so
that
he
came
that
day
my
kenneth
yes
he
was
mine
after
all
some
little
time
passed
in
the
quiet
country
place
whither
sorely
against
seton
desires
medway
had
betaken
herself
for
change
she
heard
no
mention
of
major
graham
death
one
or
two
friends
casually
alluded
to
it
in
their
letters
as
very
sad
but
that
was
all
and
anne
was
glad
of
it
i
must
brace
myself
to
hear
it
spoken
of
and
discussed
by
the
friends
who
knew
him
well
who
knew
how
well
knew
him
she
reflected
but
i
am
glad
to
escape
it
for
a
while
it
was
february
already
more
than
three
months
since
kenneth
graham
had
left
england
when
one
morning
among
letters
forwarded
from
her
london
address
came
a
thin
foreign
paper
one
with
the
traces
of
travel
upon
it
of
which
the
superscription
made
anne
start
and
then
turn
pale
and
cold
i
did
not
think
of
this
she
said
to
herself
he
must
have
left
it
to
be
forwarded
to
me
it
is
terrible
getting
a
letter
after
the
hand
that
wrote
it
has
been
long
dead
and
cold
with
trembling
fingers
she
opened
it
my
dear
may
i
say
my
dearest
anne
were
the
first
words
that
her
eyes
fell
on
her
own
filled
with
tears
wiping
them
away
before
going
on
to
read
more
she
caught
sight
of
the
date
on
board
troopship
november
anne
started
stranger
and
stranger
days
later
than
the
reported
date
of
his
death
and
the
writing
so
strong
and
clear
no
sign
of
weakness
or
illness
even
she
read
on
with
frantic
eagerness
it
was
not
a
very
long
letter
but
when
anne
had
read
the
two
or
three
somewhat
hurriedly
written
pages
her
face
had
changed
as
if
from
careworn
pallid
middle
age
back
to
fresh
sunny
youth
she
fell
on
her
knees
in
fervent
unspoken
thanksgiving
she
kissed
the
letter
the
dear
beautiful
letter
as
if
it
were
a
living
thing
it
is
too
much
too
much
she
said
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
such
blessedness
this
was
what
the
letter
told
the
officer
whose
death
had
been
announced
was
not
our
major
graham
not
graham
of
the
at
all
but
an
officer
belonging
to
another
regiment
who
had
come
on
board
at
madeira
to
return
to
india
believing
his
health
to
be
quite
restored
the
doctors
had
in
some
way
mistaken
his
case
wrote
kenneth
for
he
broke
down
again
quite
suddenly
and
died
two
days
ago
he
was
a
very
good
fellow
and
we
have
all
been
very
cut
up
about
it
he
took
a
fancy
to
me
and
i
have
been
up
some
nights
with
him
and
i
am
rather
done
up
myself
i
write
this
to
post
at
the
cape
for
a
fear
has
struck
me
that
his
initials
being
so
like
mine
some
report
may
reach
you
that
it
is
not
he
would
you
care
very
much
dear
anne
i
dare
to
think
you
would
but
i
can
not
in
a
letter
tell
you
why
i
must
wait
till
i
see
you
i
have
had
a
somewhat
strange
experience
and
it
is
possible
just
possible
that
i
may
be
able
to
tell
you
all
about
it
sooner
than
i
had
any
idea
of
when
i
last
saw
you
in
the
meantime
and
god
bless
you
my
dear
child
then
followed
a
postscript
of
some
days
later
date
written
in
great
perturbation
of
spirit
at
finding
that
the
letter
had
by
mistake
not
been
posted
at
the
cape
after
all
my
anxiety
that
you
should
see
it
as
soon
as
or
before
the
newspapers
it
is
really
too
bad
i
can
not
understand
how
it
happened
i
suppose
it
was
that
i
was
so
busy
getting
poor
graham
papers
and
things
together
to
send
on
shore
that
i
overlooked
it
it
can
not
now
be
posted
till
we
get
to
galles
that
was
all
but
was
it
not
enough
and
more
than
enough
the
next
few
weeks
passed
for
anne
medway
like
a
happy
dream
she
was
content
now
to
wait
years
even
she
had
recovered
faith
in
herself
faith
in
the
future
the
next
indian
mail
brought
her
no
letter
somewhat
to
her
surprise
she
wondered
what
had
made
kenneth
allude
to
his
perhaps
seeing
her
again
before
long
she
wondered
almost
more
what
was
the
strange
experience
to
which
he
referred
could
it
have
had
any
connection
with
her
strange
experience
that
november
afternoon
and
thus
wondering
she
was
sitting
alone
in
her
own
house
again
by
this
time
one
evening
towards
the
end
of
april
when
a
ring
at
the
bell
made
her
look
up
from
the
book
she
was
reading
half
dreamily
asking
herself
what
visitor
could
be
coming
so
late
she
heard
steps
and
voices
a
door
shutting
then
ambrose
opened
that
of
the
where
she
was
sitting
and
came
up
to
her
his
wrinkled
old
face
all
flushed
and
beaming
it
was
me
that
frightened
you
so
that
day
he
began
right
it
should
be
me
again
but
it
himself
his
very
own
self
this
time
you
may
believe
me
indeed
anne
started
to
her
feet
she
felt
herself
growing
pale
she
trembled
so
that
she
could
scarcely
stand
where
is
he
she
said
you
have
not
put
him
into
the
library
anywhere
but
there
he
would
have
it
so
he
said
he
would
explain
to
you
oh
go
to
him
you
see
it
be
all
right
anne
made
her
way
to
the
library
but
at
the
door
a
strange
tremor
seized
her
she
could
scarcely
control
herself
to
open
it
yes
there
again
on
the
hearthrug
stood
the
tall
figure
she
had
so
often
pictured
thus
to
herself
she
trembled
and
all
but
fell
but
his
voice
his
own
hearty
living
voice
speaking
to
her
in
accents
tenderer
and
deeper
than
ever
heretofore
reassured
her
and
dispersed
at
once
the
fear
that
had
hovered
about
her
anne
my
dear
anne
it
is
i
myself
do
look
so
frightened
and
in
a
moment
he
had
led
her
forward
and
stood
with
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
looking
with
his
kind
earnest
eyes
into
hers
yes
he
said
dreamily
it
was
just
thus
oh
how
often
i
have
thought
of
this
moment
anne
if
i
am
mistaken
forgive
my
presumption
but
i
think
i
am
anne
my
darling
you
love
me
there
was
no
need
of
words
anne
hid
her
face
on
his
shoulder
for
one
happy
moment
then
amidst
the
tears
that
come
she
told
him
all
all
she
had
suffered
and
hoped
and
feared
her
love
and
her
agony
of
humiliation
when
she
thought
it
was
not
returned
her
terrible
grief
when
she
thought
him
dead
and
yet
the
consolation
of
believing
herself
to
have
been
his
last
thought
in
life
so
you
shall
be
my
first
and
my
last
he
answered
my
anne
my
very
own
and
then
she
told
him
more
of
the
strange
story
we
know
he
listened
with
intense
eagerness
but
without
testifying
much
surprise
far
less
incredulity
i
anticipated
something
of
the
kind
he
said
after
a
moment
or
two
of
silence
it
is
very
strange
listen
anne
at
the
time
the
exact
time
so
far
as
i
can
roughly
calculate
at
which
you
thought
you
saw
me
i
was
of
you
it
was
between
four
and
five
in
the
afternoon
was
it
not
anne
bowed
her
head
in
assent
that
would
have
made
it
about
six
where
we
then
were
he
went
on
consideringly
yes
it
was
about
seven
when
i
awoke
i
had
lain
down
that
afternoon
with
a
frightful
headache
poor
graham
had
died
shortly
before
midnight
the
night
before
and
i
had
not
been
able
to
sleep
though
i
was
very
tired
i
daresay
i
was
not
altogether
in
what
the
doctors
call
a
normal
condition
from
the
physical
fatigue
and
the
effect
generally
of
having
watched
him
die
i
was
feeling
less
if
you
can
understand
than
one
usually
does
it
is
to
me
at
least
to
watch
a
deathbed
without
wondering
about
it
all
about
what
comes
after
intensely
and
graham
was
so
good
so
patient
and
resigned
and
trustful
though
it
was
awfully
hard
for
him
to
die
he
had
every
reason
to
wish
to
live
well
anne
when
i
fell
asleep
that
afternoon
i
at
once
began
dreaming
about
you
i
had
been
thinking
about
you
a
great
deal
constantly
almost
ever
since
we
set
sail
for
just
before
starting
i
had
got
a
hint
that
this
appointment
i
have
not
told
you
about
it
yet
but
that
will
keep
i
have
accepted
it
as
you
see
by
my
being
here
i
got
a
hint
that
it
would
probably
be
offered
me
and
that
if
i
did
mind
paying
my
passage
back
almost
as
soon
as
i
got
out
i
had
better
make
up
my
mind
to
accept
it
i
felt
that
it
hung
upon
and
yet
i
did
not
see
how
to
find
out
what
you
would
say
without
without
risking
what
i
your
sisterly
friendship
it
came
into
my
head
just
as
i
was
falling
asleep
that
i
would
write
to
you
from
the
cape
and
tell
you
of
graham
death
to
avoid
any
mistaken
report
and
that
i
might
in
my
letter
somehow
feel
my
way
a
little
this
was
all
in
my
mind
and
as
i
fell
asleep
it
got
confused
so
that
i
did
not
know
afterwards
clearly
where
to
separate
it
from
my
dream
and
what
was
the
dream
asked
anne
breathlessly
precisely
what
you
he
replied
i
fancied
myself
here
rushing
upstairs
to
the
library
in
my
haste
to
see
you
to
tell
you
i
was
not
dead
and
to
ask
you
if
you
would
have
cared
much
had
it
been
so
i
saw
all
the
scene
the
hall
the
staircase
already
lighted
this
room
and
you
coming
in
at
the
door
with
a
look
in
your
face
then
it
grew
confused
i
next
remember
standing
here
beside
you
on
the
hearthrug
with
my
hand
on
your
shoulder
anne
and
gazing
into
your
eyes
and
struggling
to
ask
you
what
i
wanted
so
terribly
to
know
but
the
words
would
not
come
and
the
agony
seemed
to
awake
me
yet
with
the
awaking
came
the
answer
had
answered
me
i
said
to
myself
anne
does
love
me
and
anne
remembered
the
strange
feeling
of
joy
which
had
come
to
her
even
in
the
first
bitterness
of
her
grief
she
turned
to
the
hand
that
still
lay
on
her
shoulder
and
kissed
it
oh
kenneth
she
said
how
thankful
we
should
be
but
how
strange
to
think
that
we
owe
all
to
a
dream
it
a
dream
kenneth
he
shook
his
head
you
must
ask
that
of
wiser
people
than
i
he
said
i
suppose
it
was
but
how
could
it
have
been
a
dream
said
anne
again
you
forget
kenneth
ambrose
saw
you
too
though
i
did
not
see
him
nor
even
think
of
him
yes
that
makes
it
even
more
incomprehensible
it
must
have
been
the
old
fellow
devotion
to
you
anne
that
made
him
sympathise
with
you
somehow
i
am
glad
he
saw
you
said
anne
i
should
prefer
to
think
it
more
than
a
dream
and
there
is
always
more
evidence
in
favour
of
any
story
of
the
kind
if
it
has
been
witnessed
by
two
but
there
is
one
other
thing
i
want
to
ask
you
it
has
struck
me
since
that
you
answered
me
rather
abstractedly
that
last
evening
when
i
spoke
about
your
address
and
asked
if
there
was
any
other
of
the
name
in
your
regiment
once
or
twice
i
have
drawn
a
faint
ray
of
hope
from
remembering
your
not
very
decided
answer
yes
it
was
stupid
of
me
i
half
remembered
it
afterwards
i
should
have
explained
it
but
it
scarcely
seemed
worth
while
i
did
know
another
major
graham
might
be
joining
us
at
funchal
for
that
very
day
i
had
been
entrusted
with
letters
for
him
but
i
abstracted
that
evening
anne
i
was
trying
to
persuade
myself
i
did
care
for
what
i
now
know
i
care
for
more
than
for
life
itself
your
love
anne
iii
unexplained
part
i
for
facts
are
stubborn
smollett
silberbach
what
in
the
name
of
everything
that
is
eccentric
should
you
go
there
for
the
most
uninteresting
altogether
unattractive
little
hole
in
all
germany
what
can
have
put
silberbach
in
your
head
i
really
do
know
i
answered
rather
tired
to
tell
the
truth
of
the
discussion
there
does
seem
any
particular
reason
why
anybody
ever
should
go
to
silberbach
except
that
goethe
and
the
duke
of
weimar
are
supposed
to
have
gone
there
to
dance
with
the
peasant
maidens
i
certainly
do
see
that
that
is
any
reason
why
should
go
there
still
on
the
other
hand
i
do
see
that
it
is
any
reason
why
i
should
i
only
want
to
find
some
thoroughly
country
place
where
the
children
and
i
can
do
as
we
like
for
a
fortnight
or
so
it
is
really
too
hot
to
stay
in
a
town
even
a
little
town
like
this
yes
that
is
true
said
my
friend
it
is
a
pity
you
took
up
your
quarters
in
the
town
you
might
have
taken
a
little
villa
outside
and
then
you
would
not
have
needed
to
go
away
at
all
i
wanted
a
rest
from
housekeeping
and
our
queer
old
inn
is
very
comfortable
i
said
besides
being
here
would
it
not
be
a
pity
to
go
away
without
seeing
anything
of
the
thuringian
forest
yes
certainly
it
would
i
quite
agree
with
you
about
everything
except
about
silberbach
is
what
i
can
not
get
over
you
have
not
enough
my
dear
i
am
certain
silberbach
is
some
freak
of
herr
von
walden
most
unpractical
man
why
i
really
am
not
at
all
sure
that
you
will
get
anything
to
eat
there
i
am
not
afraid
of
part
of
it
i
replied
philosophically
with
plenty
of
milk
fresh
eggs
and
bread
and
butter
we
can
always
get
on
and
those
i
suppose
we
are
sure
to
find
milk
and
eggs
yes
i
suppose
so
butter
is
doubtful
once
you
leave
the
tourist
track
and
the
bread
will
be
the
sour
bread
of
the
country
i
do
mind
that
nor
do
the
children
but
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
we
need
not
stay
at
silberbach
we
can
always
get
away
that
is
certainly
true
if
one
can
get
there
one
can
i
suppose
always
get
away
answered
fräulein
ottilia
with
a
smile
though
i
confess
it
is
a
curious
inducement
to
name
for
going
a
place
that
one
can
get
away
from
it
however
we
need
not
say
any
more
about
it
i
see
your
heart
is
set
on
silberbach
and
i
am
quite
sure
i
shall
have
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
you
own
i
was
right
in
trying
to
dissuade
you
from
it
when
you
come
back
again
she
added
rather
maliciously
perhaps
so
but
it
is
not
silberbach
we
are
going
to
we
shall
see
lots
of
other
places
herr
von
walden
has
planned
it
all
the
first
three
days
we
shall
travel
mostly
on
foot
i
think
it
will
be
great
fun
nora
and
reggie
are
enchanted
of
course
i
would
not
travel
on
foot
alone
with
them
it
would
hardly
be
safe
i
suppose
safe
oh
yes
safe
enough
the
peasants
are
very
quiet
civil
people
honest
and
kindly
though
generally
desperately
poor
but
you
would
be
enough
anywhere
in
thuringia
it
is
not
like
alsace
where
now
and
then
one
does
meet
with
rather
queer
customers
in
the
forests
so
then
my
dear
for
the
next
two
or
three
weeks
and
may
you
enjoy
yourself
especially
at
silberbach
at
silberbach
that
is
to
say
even
if
i
have
to
own
you
were
right
and
i
wrong
yes
my
dear
i
am
unselfish
enough
to
hope
you
will
return
having
found
silberbach
an
earthly
paradise
and
waving
her
hand
in
adieu
kind
fräulein
ottilia
stood
at
her
watching
me
make
my
way
down
the
dusty
road
she
is
a
little
prejudiced
i
daresay
i
thought
to
myself
prejudiced
against
herr
von
walden
choice
for
i
notice
every
one
here
has
their
pet
places
and
their
special
aversions
i
daresay
we
shall
like
silberbach
and
if
not
we
need
not
stay
there
after
the
waldens
leave
us
anyway
i
shall
be
thankful
to
get
out
of
this
heat
into
the
real
country
i
was
spending
the
summer
in
a
part
of
germany
hitherto
new
ground
to
me
we
had
the
we
meaning
myself
and
my
two
younger
children
nora
of
twelve
and
reggie
of
nine
settled
down
for
the
greater
part
of
the
time
in
a
small
town
on
the
borders
of
the
thuringian
forest
small
but
not
in
its
own
estimation
unimportant
for
it
was
a
residenz
with
a
fortress
of
sufficiently
ancient
date
to
be
well
worth
visiting
even
had
the
view
from
its
ramparts
been
far
less
beautiful
than
it
was
and
had
the
little
town
possessed
no
attractions
of
its
own
natural
or
artificial
the
extreme
cordiality
and
kindness
of
its
most
hospitable
inhabitants
would
have
left
the
pleasantest
impression
on
my
mind
i
was
sorry
to
leave
my
friends
even
for
two
or
three
weeks
but
it
was
hot
nora
was
pale
and
reggie
noble
appetite
gave
signs
of
flagging
besides
as
i
had
said
to
ottilia
it
would
be
too
absurd
to
have
come
so
far
and
not
see
the
lions
of
the
neighbourhood
so
we
were
to
start
the
next
morning
for
an
excursion
in
the
forest
in
the
company
of
herr
von
walden
his
wife
and
son
and
two
young
men
friends
of
the
latter
we
were
to
travel
by
rail
over
the
first
part
of
the
ground
uninteresting
enough
till
we
reached
a
point
where
we
could
make
our
way
on
foot
through
the
woods
for
a
considerable
distance
then
after
spending
the
night
in
a
village
whose
beautiful
situation
had
tempted
some
enterprising
speculator
to
build
a
good
hotel
we
proposed
the
next
day
to
plunge
still
deeper
into
the
real
recesses
of
the
forest
walking
and
driving
by
turns
in
accordance
with
our
inclination
and
the
resources
of
the
country
in
respect
of
the
light
carriage
with
the
horse
invariably
yoked
at
one
side
of
the
pole
instead
of
between
shafts
in
which
one
gets
about
more
speedily
and
safely
than
might
be
imagined
and
at
the
end
of
three
or
four
days
of
this
weather
permitting
agreeably
nomad
life
our
friends
the
waldens
obliged
to
return
to
their
home
in
the
town
from
which
we
started
were
to
leave
my
children
and
me
for
a
fortnight
country
air
in
this
same
village
of
silberbach
which
ottilia
so
vehemently
objected
to
i
did
not
then
i
do
not
now
know
and
i
am
pretty
sure
he
himself
could
not
say
why
our
guide
herr
von
walden
had
chosen
silberbach
from
among
the
dozens
of
other
villages
which
could
quite
as
well
as
events
proved
indeed
infinitely
better
have
served
our
very
simple
purpose
it
was
a
chance
as
such
things
often
are
but
a
chance
which
as
you
will
see
left
its
mark
in
a
manner
which
can
never
be
altogether
effaced
from
my
memory
the
programme
was
successfully
carried
out
the
weather
was
magnificent
nobody
fell
ill
or
footsore
or
turned
out
unexpectedly
and
it
was
hot
enough
even
in
the
forest
shades
which
we
kept
to
as
much
as
possible
to
have
excused
some
amount
of
irritability
but
we
were
all
sound
and
strong
and
had
entered
into
a
tacit
compact
of
making
the
best
of
things
and
enjoying
ourselves
as
much
as
we
could
nora
and
reggie
perhaps
by
the
end
of
the
second
day
began
to
have
doubts
as
to
the
delights
of
indefinitely
continued
walking
excursions
and
though
they
would
not
have
owned
to
it
they
were
not
i
think
sorry
to
hear
that
the
greater
part
of
the
fourth
day
travels
was
to
be
on
wheels
but
they
were
very
well
off
lutz
von
walden
and
his
two
friends
a
young
baron
rather
the
typical
german
student
in
appearance
though
in
reality
as
hearty
and
unsentimental
as
any
john
bull
of
his
age
and
rank
and
george
norman
an
english
boy
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
getting
up
german
for
an
army
examination
were
all
three
only
too
ready
to
carry
my
little
boy
on
their
backs
on
any
sign
of
and
indeed
more
than
one
hint
reached
me
that
they
would
willingly
have
done
the
same
by
nora
had
the
dignity
of
her
twelve
years
allowed
of
such
a
thing
she
scarcely
looked
her
age
at
that
time
but
she
was
very
conscious
of
having
entered
on
her
teens
and
the
struggle
between
this
new
importance
and
her
hitherto
almost
boyish
tastes
was
amusing
to
watch
she
was
strong
and
healthy
in
the
extreme
intelligent
though
not
precocious
observant
but
rather
with
no
undue
development
of
the
imagination
nothing
that
by
any
kind
of
misapprehension
or
exaggeration
could
have
been
called
morbid
about
her
it
was
a
legend
in
the
family
that
the
word
nerves
existed
not
for
nora
she
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
physical
or
moral
i
could
sometimes
wish
she
had
never
learnt
otherwise
but
we
must
take
the
bad
with
the
good
the
shadow
inseparable
from
the
light
the
first
perception
of
things
not
dreamt
of
in
her
simple
childish
philosophy
came
to
nora
as
i
would
not
have
chosen
it
but
so
i
must
believe
it
had
to
be
where
are
we
to
sleep
herr
von
walden
please
asked
reggie
from
the
heights
of
lutz
broad
shoulders
late
that
third
afternoon
when
we
were
all
not
the
children
only
beginning
to
think
that
a
rest
even
in
the
barest
of
inn
parlours
and
a
dinner
even
of
the
most
modest
description
would
be
very
welcome
do
tease
so
reggie
said
nora
i
sure
herr
von
walden
has
told
you
the
name
twenty
times
already
yes
but
i
forget
it
urged
the
child
and
herr
von
walden
nowise
loath
to
do
so
again
took
up
the
tale
of
our
projected
doings
and
destinations
my
dear
child
we
sleep
at
the
pretty
little
town
yes
town
i
may
almost
call
it
of
seeberg
it
stands
in
what
i
may
call
an
oasis
of
the
forest
which
stops
abruptly
and
begins
again
some
miles
beyond
seeberg
we
should
be
there
in
another
hour
or
so
he
went
on
consulting
his
watch
i
have
of
course
written
for
rooms
there
as
i
have
done
to
all
the
places
where
we
mean
to
halt
and
so
far
i
have
not
proved
a
bad
courier
i
flatter
myself
he
paused
and
looked
round
him
complacently
no
indeed
replied
everybody
the
very
contrary
we
have
got
on
capitally
at
which
the
beaming
face
of
our
beamed
still
more
graciously
and
continued
reggie
in
his
funny
german
pounding
away
vigorously
at
lutz
shoulders
meanwhile
what
do
we
do
we
must
have
an
is
it
not
so
not
that
we
are
tired
but
you
said
we
had
far
to
go
yes
an
for
the
ladies
your
amiable
mother
miss
nora
and
my
wife
and
you
reggie
will
find
a
corner
beside
the
driver
myself
and
these
young
fellows
indicating
the
three
friends
by
a
wave
of
the
hand
will
start
from
seeberg
betimes
giving
you
at
ulrichsthal
where
there
are
some
famous
ruins
and
you
must
not
forget
he
added
turning
to
his
wife
and
me
to
stop
at
grünstein
as
you
pass
and
spend
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
the
china
manufactory
there
just
what
i
wanted
said
frau
von
walden
i
have
a
from
there
and
i
am
in
hopes
of
matching
it
i
had
a
good
many
breakages
last
winter
with
a
dreadfully
careless
servant
and
there
is
a
good
deal
to
replace
i
do
think
i
know
the
grünstein
china
i
said
is
it
very
pretty
it
is
very
like
the
that
one
sees
so
much
of
with
us
said
frau
von
walden
that
the
ordinary
is
made
at
blauenstein
but
there
is
more
variety
of
colours
at
grünstein
they
are
rather
more
enterprising
there
i
fancy
and
perhaps
there
is
a
finer
quality
of
china
clay
or
whatever
they
call
it
in
that
neighbourhood
i
often
wonder
the
thuringian
china
is
not
more
used
in
england
where
you
are
so
fond
of
novelties
and
where
nothing
is
so
appreciated
as
what
comes
from
a
distance
said
george
norman
by
jove
is
that
a
pretty
picture
he
broke
off
suddenly
and
we
all
stood
still
to
admire
it
was
the
month
of
august
already
the
subdued
evening
lights
were
replacing
the
brilliant
sunshine
and
blue
sky
of
the
glowing
summer
day
we
were
in
the
forest
through
which
at
this
part
ran
the
main
road
which
we
were
following
to
seeberg
at
one
side
of
the
road
the
ground
descended
abruptly
to
a
considerable
depth
and
there
in
the
defile
far
beneath
us
ran
a
stream
on
one
bank
of
which
the
trees
had
been
for
some
distance
cleared
away
leaving
a
strip
of
pasture
of
the
most
vivid
green
imaginable
and
just
below
where
we
stood
a
goatherd
in
what
thanks
possibly
to
the
enchantment
of
the
distance
appeared
a
picturesque
costume
was
slowly
making
his
way
along
piping
as
he
went
and
his
flock
of
some
fifteen
or
twenty
goats
of
every
colour
and
size
following
him
according
to
their
own
eccentric
fashion
some
scrambling
on
the
bits
of
rock
a
little
way
up
the
ascending
ground
others
quietly
browsing
here
and
there
on
their
way
the
tinkling
of
their
reaching
us
with
a
silvery
sound
through
the
still
softer
and
fainter
notes
of
the
pipe
there
was
something
strangely
fascinating
about
it
all
something
pathetic
in
the
goatherd
music
simple
barbaric
even
as
it
was
and
in
the
distant
uncertain
tinkling
which
impressed
us
all
and
for
a
moment
or
two
no
one
spoke
what
is
it
that
it
reminds
me
of
said
lutz
suddenly
i
seem
to
have
seen
and
heard
it
all
before
yes
i
know
exactly
how
you
mean
i
replied
it
is
like
a
dream
and
as
i
said
so
i
walked
on
again
a
little
in
advance
of
the
others
with
lutz
and
his
rider
for
i
i
saw
a
philosophical
or
metaphysical
dissertation
preparing
in
herr
von
walden
bent
brows
and
general
look
of
absorption
and
somehow
just
then
it
would
have
spoilt
it
all
lutz
seemed
instinctively
to
understand
for
he
too
for
a
moment
or
so
was
silent
when
suddenly
a
joyful
cry
arose
seeberg
exclaimed
several
voices
for
the
first
sight
of
our
temporary
destination
broke
upon
the
view
all
at
once
as
is
often
the
case
in
these
more
or
less
wooded
districts
one
travels
for
hours
together
as
if
in
an
enchanted
land
of
changeless
monotony
trees
trees
everywhere
and
nothing
but
trees
one
could
fancy
late
in
the
afternoon
that
one
was
back
at
the
early
morning
when
suddenly
the
forest
stops
sharply
and
completely
where
the
hand
of
man
has
decreed
that
it
should
not
by
gradual
degrees
as
when
things
have
been
left
to
the
gentler
management
of
nature
and
time
so
our
satisfaction
was
the
greater
from
not
having
known
the
goal
of
that
day
journey
to
be
so
near
we
began
to
allow
to
each
other
for
the
first
time
that
we
were
a
tired
and
with
far
less
hesitation
that
we
were
hungry
still
we
were
not
a
very
party
when
the
inhabitants
of
seeberg
turned
out
at
doors
and
windows
to
inspect
us
reggie
of
course
whom
no
consideration
could
induce
to
make
his
entry
on
lutz
shoulders
looking
the
freshest
of
all
and
eliciting
many
complimentary
remarks
from
the
matrons
and
maidens
of
the
place
as
we
passed
our
quarters
at
seeberg
met
with
the
approval
of
everybody
the
supper
was
excellent
our
rooms
as
clean
and
comfortable
as
could
be
wished
so
far
i
could
not
help
saying
to
my
friends
i
have
seen
no
signs
of
the
it
for
which
you
prepared
me
i
call
this
luxurious
yes
this
is
very
comfortable
said
herr
von
walden
at
silberbach
which
we
shall
reach
evening
all
will
be
much
more
homely
but
that
is
what
i
like
i
maintained
stoutly
i
assure
you
i
am
not
at
all
as
the
french
say
still
began
frau
von
walden
are
you
sure
that
you
know
what
it
means
one
has
such
romantic
unpractical
ideas
till
one
really
tries
it
for
me
i
confess
there
is
something
very
depressing
in
being
without
all
the
hundred
and
one
little
comforts
not
to
say
luxuries
that
have
become
second
nature
to
us
and
yet
i
do
not
think
i
am
a
woman
certainly
not
i
said
and
with
sincerity
if
it
were
necessary
she
went
on
i
hope
i
should
be
quite
ready
to
live
in
a
cottage
and
make
the
best
of
it
cheerfully
but
when
it
is
not
necessary
do
you
think
my
dear
friend
it
would
perhaps
be
wiser
for
you
to
arrange
to
spend
your
two
or
three
weeks
and
not
go
on
to
silberbach
you
might
return
here
from
ulrichsthal
while
we
make
our
way
home
by
silberbach
if
my
husband
really
wishes
to
see
it
i
looked
at
her
in
some
surprise
what
possessed
everybody
to
caution
me
so
against
silberbach
everybody
that
is
to
say
except
herr
von
walden
himself
a
spice
of
contradiction
began
to
influence
me
perhaps
the
worthy
herr
had
himself
been
influenced
in
the
same
way
more
than
he
realised
i
do
see
why
i
should
do
so
i
said
we
expect
really
to
enjoy
ourselves
at
silberbach
you
have
no
reason
for
advising
me
to
give
it
up
no
oh
no
none
in
particular
she
replied
i
have
only
a
feeling
that
it
is
rather
out
of
the
way
and
lonely
for
you
supposing
for
instance
one
of
the
children
got
ill
there
oh
my
dear
you
are
fanciful
said
her
husband
why
should
the
children
get
ill
there
more
than
anywhere
else
if
one
thought
of
all
these
possibilities
one
would
never
stir
from
home
and
you
know
my
maid
is
ready
to
follow
me
as
soon
as
i
quite
settle
where
we
shall
stay
i
said
i
shall
not
be
alone
more
than
hours
of
course
it
would
have
been
nonsense
to
bring
lina
with
us
she
would
have
been
quite
out
of
her
element
during
our
walking
expeditions
and
i
have
a
very
civil
note
from
the
inn
at
silberbach
the
said
herr
von
walden
pulling
a
mass
of
papers
out
of
his
pocket
where
can
it
be
not
that
it
matters
he
will
have
supper
and
beds
ready
for
us
night
and
then
he
went
on
to
me
if
you
like
it
you
can
make
some
arrangement
for
the
time
you
wish
to
stay
if
not
you
can
return
here
or
go
on
to
any
place
that
takes
your
fancy
we
my
wife
and
i
and
these
boys
be
home
by
saturday
afternoon
so
we
can
only
stay
the
one
night
at
silberbach
for
this
was
thursday
and
so
it
was
settled
the
next
day
dawned
as
bright
and
cloudless
as
its
predecessors
the
gentlemen
had
started
i
should
be
afraid
to
say
how
early
meaning
to
be
overtaken
by
us
at
ulrichsthal
reggie
had
gone
to
bed
with
the
firm
intention
of
accompanying
them
but
as
it
was
not
easy
to
wake
him
and
get
him
up
in
time
to
eat
his
breakfast
and
be
ready
when
the
came
round
to
the
door
my
predictions
that
he
would
be
too
sleepy
for
so
early
a
start
proved
true
it
was
pleasant
in
the
early
morning
pleasanter
than
it
would
be
later
in
the
day
i
noticed
an
unusual
amount
of
blue
haze
on
the
distant
for
the
road
along
which
we
were
driving
was
open
on
all
sides
for
some
distance
and
the
view
was
extensive
that
betokens
great
heat
i
suppose
i
said
pointing
out
the
appearance
i
observed
to
my
companion
i
suppose
so
that
bluish
mist
probably
increases
in
hot
and
sultry
weather
she
said
but
it
is
always
to
be
seen
more
or
less
in
this
country
and
is
i
believe
peculiar
to
some
of
the
german
hill
and
forest
districts
i
do
know
what
it
comes
from
whether
it
has
to
do
with
the
immense
number
of
pines
in
the
forests
perhaps
some
one
i
think
once
told
me
that
it
indicates
the
presence
of
a
great
deal
of
electricity
in
the
air
but
i
am
far
too
ignorant
to
know
if
that
is
true
or
not
and
i
am
far
too
ignorant
to
know
what
the
effect
would
be
if
it
were
so
i
said
it
is
a
very
healthy
country
is
it
not
for
strangers
it
certainly
is
doctors
send
their
patients
here
from
all
parts
of
germany
but
the
inhabitants
themselves
do
not
seem
strong
or
healthy
one
sees
a
good
many
deformed
people
and
they
all
look
pale
and
thin
much
less
robust
than
the
people
of
the
black
forest
but
that
may
come
from
their
poverty
the
peasants
of
the
black
forest
are
proverbially
well
off
a
distant
very
distant
peal
of
thunder
was
heard
at
this
moment
i
hope
the
weather
is
not
going
to
break
up
yet
i
said
are
there
often
bad
thunderstorms
here
yes
i
think
we
do
have
a
good
many
in
this
part
of
the
world
she
replied
but
i
do
not
think
there
are
any
signs
of
one
at
present
and
then
still
a
little
sleepy
and
tired
from
our
unusual
exertions
of
the
last
three
days
we
all
three
frau
von
walden
nora
and
myself
sat
very
still
for
some
time
though
the
sound
of
reggie
voice
persistently
endeavouring
to
make
the
driver
understand
his
inquiries
showed
that
he
was
as
lively
as
ever
he
turned
round
after
a
while
in
triumph
mamma
frau
von
walden
he
exclaimed
we
are
close
to
that
place
where
they
make
the
cups
and
saucers
herr
von
walden
said
we
were
to
forget
to
go
there
and
you
all
have
forgotten
you
see
if
it
had
been
for
me
he
added
complacently
grünstein
said
frau
von
walden
well
tell
the
driver
to
stop
there
he
can
rest
his
horses
for
half
an
hour
or
so
and
thank
you
for
reminding
us
reggie
for
i
should
have
been
sorry
to
lose
the
opportunity
of
matching
my
service
the
china
manufactory
was
not
of
any
very
remarkable
interest
at
least
not
for
those
who
had
visited
such
places
before
but
the
people
were
exceedingly
civil
and
evidently
very
pleased
to
have
visitors
and
while
my
friend
was
looking
out
the
things
she
was
specially
in
search
of
a
business
which
promised
to
take
some
little
time
a
or
functionary
of
some
kind
proposed
to
take
the
children
to
see
the
sheds
where
the
first
mixing
and
kneading
took
place
the
moulding
rooms
the
painting
rooms
the
ovens
in
short
the
whole
process
they
accepted
his
offer
with
delight
and
i
wandered
about
the
various
pattern
or
show
rooms
examining
and
admiring
all
that
was
to
be
seen
poking
into
corners
where
any
specially
pretty
bit
of
china
caught
my
eye
but
there
was
no
great
variety
in
design
or
colour
though
both
were
good
of
their
kind
the
grünsteiners
like
their
rivals
of
blauenstein
seeming
content
to
follow
in
the
steps
of
their
fathers
without
seeking
for
new
inspirations
suddenly
however
all
but
hidden
in
a
corner
far
away
back
on
a
shelf
a
flash
of
richer
tints
made
me
start
forward
eagerly
there
was
no
one
near
to
apply
to
at
the
moment
so
i
carefully
drew
out
my
treasure
trove
it
was
a
cup
and
saucer
evidently
of
the
finest
quality
of
china
though
pretty
similar
in
shape
to
the
regular
grünstein
ware
but
in
colouring
infinitely
richer
really
beautiful
with
an
almost
oriental
cleverness
in
the
blending
of
the
many
shades
and
yet
decidedly
more
striking
and
uncommon
than
any
of
the
modern
oriental
with
which
of
late
years
the
facilities
of
trade
with
the
east
make
us
so
familiar
i
stood
with
the
cup
in
my
hand
turning
it
around
and
admiring
it
when
frau
von
walden
and
the
woman
who
had
been
attending
to
her
orders
came
forward
to
where
i
was
see
here
i
exclaimed
here
is
a
lovely
cup
now
a
service
like
that
be
tempting
have
you
more
of
it
i
inquired
of
the
woman
she
shook
her
head
that
is
all
that
remains
she
said
we
have
never
kept
it
in
stock
it
is
far
too
expensive
of
course
it
can
be
made
to
order
though
it
would
take
some
months
and
cost
a
good
deal
i
wish
i
could
order
a
service
of
it
i
said
but
when
i
heard
how
much
it
would
probably
cost
it
was
my
turn
to
shake
my
head
no
i
must
consider
about
it
i
decided
but
i
really
have
never
seen
anything
prettier
can
i
buy
this
cup
the
woman
hesitated
it
is
the
only
one
left
she
said
but
i
think
oh
yes
i
feel
sure
we
have
the
pattern
among
the
painting
designs
this
cup
belonged
to
or
rather
was
an
extra
one
of
a
made
expressly
for
the
duchess
of
t
on
her
marriage
now
some
years
ago
and
it
is
curious
we
sold
the
other
one
there
were
two
too
many
to
a
compatriot
of
yours
the
gracious
lady
is
english
two
or
three
years
ago
he
admired
them
so
much
and
felt
sure
his
mother
would
send
an
order
if
he
took
it
home
to
show
her
a
tall
handsome
young
man
he
was
i
remember
it
so
well
just
about
this
time
of
the
year
and
hot
sultry
weather
like
this
he
was
travelling
on
foot
for
pleasure
no
doubt
for
he
had
quite
the
air
of
a
and
he
bought
the
cup
and
took
it
with
him
but
he
has
never
written
i
made
sure
he
would
have
done
so
he
did
not
leave
his
name
or
address
i
said
for
the
world
is
a
small
place
it
was
just
possible
i
might
have
known
him
and
the
little
coincidence
would
have
been
curious
oh
no
said
the
woman
but
i
have
often
wondered
why
he
changed
his
mind
he
seemed
so
sure
about
sending
the
order
it
was
not
the
price
that
made
him
hesitate
but
he
wished
his
lady
mother
to
make
out
the
list
herself
well
i
confess
the
price
make
hesitate
i
said
smiling
however
if
you
will
let
me
buy
this
cup
i
have
great
hopes
of
proving
a
better
customer
than
my
faithless
compatriot
i
am
sure
he
to
send
the
order
said
the
woman
she
spoke
quite
civilly
but
i
was
not
sure
that
she
liked
my
calling
him
faithless
it
is
evident
i
said
to
frau
von
walden
that
the
young
englishman
made
a
great
impression
on
her
i
rather
think
she
gave
the
fellow
cup
for
nothing
but
after
all
i
had
no
reason
to
be
jealous
for
just
then
the
woman
returned
after
consulting
the
manager
to
tell
me
i
might
have
the
cup
and
saucer
and
for
a
less
sum
than
their
real
worth
seeing
that
i
was
taking
it
in
a
sense
as
a
pattern
then
she
wrapped
it
up
for
me
carefully
and
in
several
papers
of
which
the
outside
one
was
bright
blue
and
very
proud
of
my
acquisition
i
followed
frau
von
walden
to
the
other
side
of
the
building
containing
the
workrooms
where
we
found
the
two
children
full
of
interest
about
all
they
had
seen
i
should
here
perhaps
apologise
for
entering
into
so
much
and
apparently
trifling
detail
but
as
will
i
think
be
seen
when
i
have
told
all
i
have
to
tell
it
would
be
difficult
to
give
the
main
facts
fairly
and
so
as
to
avoid
all
danger
of
any
mistaken
impression
without
relating
the
whole
of
the
surroundings
if
i
tried
to
condense
to
pick
out
the
salient
points
to
enter
into
no
particulars
but
such
as
directly
and
unmistakably
lead
up
to
the
central
interest
i
might
unintentionally
omit
what
those
wiser
than
i
would
consider
as
bearing
on
it
so
like
a
patient
adjured
by
his
doctor
or
a
client
urged
by
his
lawyer
to
tell
the
whole
at
the
risk
of
i
prefer
to
run
that
risk
while
claiming
my
readers
forgiveness
for
so
doing
rather
than
that
of
relating
my
story
incompletely
and
what
i
would
here
beg
to
have
specially
observed
is
not
one
word
about
the
young
englishman
had
been
heard
by
she
was
in
fact
in
a
distant
part
of
the
building
at
the
time
the
saleswoman
was
telling
us
about
him
and
furthermore
i
am
equally
certain
and
so
is
frau
von
walden
that
neither
she
nor
i
then
or
afterwards
mentioned
the
subject
to
or
in
the
presence
of
the
children
i
did
not
show
her
the
cup
and
saucer
as
it
would
have
been
a
pity
to
undo
its
careful
wrappings
all
she
knew
about
it
will
be
told
in
due
course
we
had
delayed
longer
than
we
intended
at
the
china
manufactory
and
in
consequence
we
were
somewhat
late
at
the
ulrichsthal
the
gentlemen
had
arrived
there
quite
an
hour
before
so
they
had
ordered
luncheon
or
dinner
rather
at
the
inn
and
thoroughly
explored
the
ruins
but
dinner
discussed
and
neither
frau
von
walden
nor
i
objecting
to
pipes
our
cavaliers
were
amiably
willing
to
show
us
all
there
was
to
be
seen
the
ruins
were
those
of
an
ancient
monastery
one
of
the
most
ancient
in
germany
i
believe
they
covered
a
very
large
piece
of
ground
and
had
they
been
in
somewhat
better
preservation
they
would
have
greatly
impressed
us
as
it
was
they
were
undoubtedly
even
to
the
unlearned
in
archæological
lore
very
interesting
the
position
of
the
monastery
had
been
well
and
carefully
chosen
for
on
one
side
it
commanded
a
view
of
surpassing
beauty
over
the
valley
through
which
we
had
travelled
from
seeberg
while
on
the
other
arose
still
higher
ground
richly
wooded
for
the
irrepressible
forest
here
as
it
were
broke
out
again
it
is
a
most
lovely
spot
i
said
with
some
enthusiasm
as
we
sat
in
the
shade
of
the
ruined
cloisters
the
sunshine
flecking
the
sward
in
eccentric
patches
as
it
made
its
way
through
what
had
evidently
been
windows
how
one
wishes
it
were
possible
to
see
it
as
it
must
have
been
how
many
three
or
four
hundred
years
ago
i
suppose
lutz
grunted
what
did
you
say
lutz
asked
his
mother
nothing
particular
he
sighed
i
was
only
thinking
of
what
i
read
in
the
that
the
monastery
was
destroyed
partly
by
lightning
i
believe
all
the
same
by
order
of
the
authorities
in
consequence
of
the
really
awful
wickedness
of
the
monks
who
inhabited
it
so
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
have
been
a
very
nice
place
to
visit
at
the
time
you
speak
of
gracious
lady
begging
your
pardon
what
a
pity
i
said
with
a
little
shudder
i
do
not
like
to
think
of
it
and
i
was
going
to
say
how
beautiful
it
must
be
here
in
the
moonlight
but
now
that
you
have
disenchanted
me
lutz
i
should
not
like
it
at
all
and
i
arose
as
i
spoke
why
not
mamma
said
reggie
curiously
i
had
not
noticed
that
he
and
his
sister
were
listening
to
us
they
not
here
not
those
naughty
monks
no
of
course
not
agreed
practical
nora
mamma
only
means
that
it
is
a
pity
such
a
beautiful
big
house
as
this
must
have
been
to
be
pulled
down
such
a
waste
when
there
are
so
many
poor
people
in
the
world
with
miserable
little
stuffy
houses
or
none
at
all
even
that
was
what
you
meant
was
it
mamma
it
is
always
a
pity
the
worst
of
pities
when
people
are
wicked
wherever
they
are
i
replied
but
monks
are
not
bad
remarked
nora
consolingly
think
of
the
great
bernard
ones
with
their
dogs
and
on
reggie
inquiring
mind
demanding
further
particulars
on
the
subject
she
walked
on
with
him
somewhat
in
front
of
the
rest
of
us
a
happy
little
pair
in
the
sunshine
lutz
said
his
father
you
can
not
be
too
careful
what
you
say
before
children
they
are
often
shocked
or
frightened
by
so
little
though
yours
are
such
little
people
he
added
turning
to
me
it
is
not
likely
anything
undesirable
would
make
any
impression
on
them
i
particularly
remember
this
little
incident
it
turned
out
a
long
walk
to
silberbach
the
longest
we
had
yet
attempted
hitherto
herr
von
walden
had
been
on
known
ground
and
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
roads
the
distances
and
all
necessary
particulars
but
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
explored
beyond
seeberg
and
before
we
had
accomplished
more
than
half
the
journey
he
began
to
feel
a
little
alarm
at
the
information
given
us
by
the
travellers
we
came
across
at
long
intervals
coming
from
not
going
to
st
ives
for
the
farther
we
went
the
greater
seemed
to
be
the
distance
we
had
to
go
an
hour
or
thereabouts
grew
into
two
or
even
three
hours
and
at
last
on
a
peculiarly
stupid
countryman
assuring
us
we
would
scarcely
reach
our
destination
before
nightfall
our
conductor
patience
broke
down
altogether
idiots
he
exclaimed
but
i
can
not
stand
this
any
longer
i
will
hasten
on
and
see
for
myself
and
if
as
i
expect
we
are
really
not
very
far
from
silberbach
it
will
be
all
the
better
for
me
to
find
out
the
and
see
that
everything
is
ready
for
your
arrival
frau
von
walden
seemed
a
little
inclined
to
protest
but
i
begged
her
not
to
do
so
seeing
that
three
protectors
still
remained
to
us
and
that
it
probably
was
really
tiresome
for
a
remarkably
good
and
trained
pedestrian
like
her
husband
to
have
to
adapt
his
vigorous
steps
to
ours
and
comfort
came
from
an
unexpected
quarter
the
old
peasant
woman
strong
and
muscular
as
any
english
labourer
whom
we
had
hired
at
seeberg
to
carry
our
bags
and
shawls
through
the
forest
overheard
the
discussion
and
for
the
first
time
broke
silence
to
assure
the
gracious
ladies
that
silberbach
was
at
no
great
distance
in
half
an
hour
or
so
we
should
come
upon
the
first
of
its
houses
though
as
for
the
she
added
that
was
farther
off
at
the
other
end
of
the
village
and
she
went
on
muttering
something
about
if
she
had
known
we
were
going
to
the
which
we
did
not
understand
but
which
afterwards
being
translated
proved
to
mean
that
she
would
have
stood
out
for
more
pay
sure
enough
at
the
end
of
not
more
than
of
an
hour
we
came
upon
one
or
two
outlying
houses
then
the
trees
gradually
here
grew
sparser
and
soon
ceased
except
in
occasional
patches
it
was
growing
dusk
but
as
we
emerged
from
the
wood
we
found
that
we
were
on
a
height
the
forest
road
having
been
a
steady
though
almost
imperceptible
ascent
far
below
gleamed
already
some
twinkling
cottage
lights
and
the
silvery
reflection
of
a
small
piece
of
water
to
be
sure
said
young
von
trachenfels
there
is
a
lake
at
silberbach
here
we
are
at
last
but
where
is
the
he
might
well
ask
never
was
there
so
tantalising
a
place
as
silberbach
instead
of
one
compact
sensible
village
it
was
more
like
three
or
four
nay
five
or
six
wretched
hamlets
each
at
several
distance
from
all
the
others
and
the
katze
of
course
was
at
the
farther
end
of
the
farthest
off
from
where
we
stood
of
these
miserable
little
ragged
ends
of
village
climbing
is
tiring
work
but
it
seemed
to
me
it
would
have
been
preferable
to
what
lay
before
us
a
continual
descent
by
the
ruggedest
of
of
nearly
two
miles
stumbling
along
in
the
half
light
tired
footsore
past
description
yet
to
our
everlasting
credit
be
it
recorded
laughing
or
trying
to
laugh
determined
at
all
costs
to
make
the
best
of
it
i
have
no
feet
left
said
poor
frau
von
walden
i
am
only
conscious
of
two
balls
attached
somehow
to
my
ankles
i
daresay
will
drop
off
soon
how
thankful
we
were
at
last
to
attain
to
what
bore
some
faint
resemblance
to
a
village
street
how
we
gazed
on
every
side
to
discover
anything
like
an
inn
how
we
stared
at
each
other
in
bewilderment
when
at
last
from
we
could
not
see
where
came
the
voice
of
herr
von
walden
shouting
to
us
to
stop
it
is
here
i
say
you
are
going
too
far
here
judging
by
the
direction
whence
came
the
words
seemed
to
be
a
mass
of
hay
of
proportions
exaggerated
perhaps
by
the
uncertain
light
truly
enormous
was
our
friend
buried
in
the
middle
of
it
not
so
by
degrees
we
made
out
his
sunburnt
face
beaming
as
ever
from
out
of
a
window
behind
the
hay
cartful
or
stack
we
were
not
sure
which
and
by
still
further
degrees
we
discovered
that
the
hay
was
being
unloaded
before
a
little
house
which
it
had
almost
entirely
hidden
from
view
and
inside
which
it
was
being
carried
apparently
by
the
front
door
for
there
was
no
other
door
to
be
seen
but
as
we
stood
in
perplexity
herr
von
walden
whose
face
had
disappeared
emerged
in
some
mysterious
way
you
can
come
through
the
kitchen
ladies
or
by
the
window
if
you
please
but
though
the
boys
and
nora
were
got
or
got
themselves
in
through
the
window
frau
von
walden
and
i
preferred
the
kitchen
and
i
remember
nothing
more
till
we
found
ourselves
all
assembled
the
original
eight
as
we
had
started
in
a
very
sort
of
cabin
which
it
appeared
was
the
of
the
renowned
hostelry
zur
katze
of
silberbach
herr
von
walden
was
vigorously
mopping
his
face
it
was
very
red
and
naturally
so
considering
the
weather
and
the
want
of
ventilation
peculiar
to
the
katze
but
it
struck
me
there
was
something
slightly
forced
about
the
beamingness
so
so
he
began
all
well
that
ends
well
but
i
must
explain
and
he
mopped
still
more
vigorously
that
there
has
been
a
slight
in
short
a
little
mistake
about
the
accommodation
i
wish
to
secure
the
supper
i
have
seen
to
and
it
will
be
served
directly
but
as
to
the
beds
and
here
he
could
not
help
laughing
our
worthy
host
has
beds
enough
we
found
afterwards
that
every
available
mattress
and
pillow
in
the
village
had
been
levied
but
there
is
but
one
or
two
i
may
say
for
the
poor
herr
had
not
lost
his
time
since
his
arrival
appalled
by
the
want
of
resources
he
had
suggested
the
levy
of
beds
and
had
got
the
host
to
spread
them
on
the
floor
of
a
granary
for
himself
the
three
young
men
and
reggie
while
his
wife
nora
and
i
were
to
occupy
the
one
bedroom
which
luckily
contained
two
small
beds
and
a
sort
of
settee
such
as
one
sees
in
old
farmhouses
all
over
the
world
so
it
was
decided
and
after
all
for
one
night
what
did
it
matter
for
one
night
that
was
for
me
the
question
the
supper
was
really
not
bad
but
the
look
and
still
worse
the
smell
of
the
room
where
it
was
served
joined
no
doubt
to
our
excessive
fatigue
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
eat
anything
my
friends
were
sorry
and
i
felt
ashamed
of
myself
for
being
so
easily
knocked
up
or
knocked
down
how
thoroughly
i
entered
into
frau
von
walden
dislike
to
roughing
it
yet
it
was
not
only
the
uncivilised
look
of
the
place
nor
the
coarse
food
nor
the
want
of
comfort
that
made
me
feel
that
one
night
of
silberbach
would
indeed
be
enough
for
me
a
sort
of
depression
of
fear
almost
came
over
me
when
i
pictured
the
two
children
and
myself
alone
in
that
strange
place
where
it
really
seemed
to
me
we
might
all
three
be
made
an
end
of
without
any
one
being
the
wiser
of
it
there
was
a
general
look
of
squalor
and
stolid
depression
about
the
people
too
the
landlord
was
a
surlily
silent
sort
of
man
his
wife
and
the
one
looked
frightened
and
anxious
and
the
only
voices
to
be
heard
were
those
of
peasants
drinking
and
quarrelling
at
the
bar
to
say
the
least
it
was
not
enlivening
yet
my
pride
was
aroused
i
did
not
like
to
own
myself
already
beaten
after
supper
i
sat
apart
reflecting
rather
gloomily
as
to
what
i
could
or
should
do
while
the
young
men
and
the
children
amused
themselves
with
the
one
piece
of
luxury
with
which
the
poorest
inn
in
thuringia
is
sure
to
be
provided
for
anomalous
as
it
may
seem
there
was
a
piano
and
by
no
means
an
altogether
decrepit
one
in
the
parlour
herr
von
walden
was
smoking
his
pipe
outside
the
hay
being
by
this
time
housed
somewhere
or
other
his
wife
who
had
been
speaking
to
him
came
in
and
sat
down
beside
me
my
dear
she
said
you
must
not
be
vexed
with
me
for
renewing
the
subject
but
i
can
not
help
it
i
feel
a
responsibility
you
must
not
you
really
think
of
staying
here
alone
with
those
two
children
it
is
not
fit
for
you
oh
how
i
blessed
her
for
breaking
the
ice
i
could
hardly
help
hugging
her
as
i
replied
diplomatically
you
really
think
so
certainly
i
do
and
so
though
perhaps
he
wo
say
so
as
frankly
so
does
my
husband
he
says
i
am
foolish
and
fanciful
but
i
confess
to
feeling
a
kind
of
dislike
to
the
place
that
i
can
not
explain
perhaps
there
is
thunder
in
the
air
that
always
affects
my
nerves
but
i
just
feel
that
i
agree
to
your
staying
on
here
very
well
i
am
quite
willing
to
go
back
to
seeberg
i
replied
meekly
of
course
we
ca
judge
of
the
place
by
what
we
have
seen
of
it
but
no
doubt
as
far
as
the
inn
is
concerned
seeberg
is
much
nicer
i
daresay
we
can
see
all
we
want
by
noon
and
get
back
to
seeberg
in
the
afternoon
kind
frau
von
walden
kissed
me
rapturously
on
both
cheeks
you
do
my
dear
the
relief
to
my
mind
of
hearing
you
say
so
and
now
i
think
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
go
to
bed
for
we
start
at
six
so
early
i
exclaimed
with
a
fresh
feeling
of
dismay
yes
indeed
and
i
must
bid
you
for
after
all
i
am
not
to
sleep
in
your
room
which
is
much
better
as
i
should
have
had
to
disturb
you
so
early
my
husband
has
found
a
tidy
room
next
door
in
a
cottage
and
we
shall
do
very
well
there
what
sort
of
a
place
she
euphemistically
described
as
a
tidy
room
i
never
discovered
but
it
would
have
been
useless
to
remonstrate
the
kind
creature
was
so
afraid
of
incommoding
us
that
she
would
have
listened
to
no
objections
herr
von
walden
came
in
just
as
we
were
about
to
wish
each
other
so
he
said
with
a
tone
of
amiable
indulgence
so
and
what
do
you
think
of
silberbach
my
wife
feels
sure
you
will
not
like
it
after
all
i
think
i
shall
see
as
much
as
i
care
to
see
of
it
in
an
hour
or
two
morning
i
replied
quietly
and
by
the
afternoon
the
children
and
i
will
go
back
to
our
comfortable
quarters
at
seeberg
ah
indeed
yes
i
daresay
it
will
be
as
well
he
said
airily
as
if
he
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
decoying
us
to
the
place
then
and
pleasant
dreams
and
but
i
interrupted
i
want
to
know
we
are
to
get
back
to
seeberg
can
i
get
an
here
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
you
have
only
to
speak
to
the
landlord
in
the
morning
and
tell
him
at
what
hour
you
want
it
he
answered
so
confidently
that
i
felt
no
sort
of
misgiving
and
i
turned
with
a
smile
to
finish
my
the
young
men
were
standing
close
beside
us
i
shook
hands
with
trachenfels
and
lutz
the
latter
of
whom
though
he
replied
as
heartily
as
usual
looked
i
thought
annoyed
george
norman
followed
me
to
the
door
of
the
room
in
front
of
us
was
the
staircase
leading
to
the
upper
regions
what
a
hole
of
a
place
said
the
boy
i
do
mind
quite
a
cottage
if
it
clean
and
cheerful
but
this
place
is
so
grim
and
squalid
i
ca
tell
you
how
glad
i
am
you
not
going
to
stay
on
here
alone
it
really
is
fit
for
you
well
you
may
be
easy
as
we
shall
only
be
here
a
few
hours
after
you
leave
yes
so
much
the
better
i
wish
i
could
have
stayed
but
i
be
back
at
kronberg
lutz
could
have
stayed
and
seen
you
back
to
seeberg
but
his
father
wo
let
him
herr
von
walden
is
so
queer
once
he
takes
an
idea
in
his
head
and
he
allow
this
place
is
all
right
but
i
daresay
there
would
be
nothing
to
hurt
us
anyway
i
will
write
to
reassure
you
that
we
have
not
fallen
into
a
nest
of
or
brigands
i
said
laughingly
certainly
it
never
occurred
to
me
or
to
my
friends
what
be
the
nature
of
the
experience
which
would
stamp
silberbach
indelibly
on
our
memory
we
must
have
been
really
very
tired
for
quite
contrary
to
our
habit
the
children
and
i
slept
late
the
next
morning
undisturbed
by
the
departure
of
our
friends
at
the
early
hour
arranged
by
them
the
sun
was
shining
and
silberbach
like
every
other
place
appeared
all
the
better
for
it
but
the
view
from
the
window
of
our
room
was
not
encouraging
it
looked
out
upon
the
village
street
a
rough
unkempt
sort
of
track
and
on
its
other
side
the
ground
rose
abruptly
to
some
height
but
treeless
and
grassless
it
seemed
more
like
the
remains
of
a
quarry
of
some
kind
for
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
stones
and
broken
pieces
of
rock
we
must
go
out
after
our
breakfast
and
look
about
us
a
little
before
we
start
i
said
but
how
glad
i
shall
be
to
get
back
to
that
bright
cheerful
seeberg
yes
indeed
said
nora
i
think
this
is
the
ugliest
place
i
ever
was
at
in
my
life
and
she
was
not
inclined
to
like
it
any
better
when
reggie
whom
we
sent
down
to
reconnoitre
came
back
to
report
that
we
must
have
our
breakfast
in
our
own
room
there
are
a
lot
of
men
down
there
smoking
and
drinking
beer
you
eat
there
said
the
child
but
after
all
it
was
to
be
our
last
meal
there
and
we
did
not
complain
the
root
coffee
was
not
too
unpalatable
with
plenty
of
good
milk
the
bread
was
sour
and
the
butter
dubious
as
ottilia
had
foretold
so
we
soaked
the
bread
in
the
coffee
like
french
peasants
mamma
said
nora
gravely
it
makes
me
sorry
for
poor
people
i
daresay
many
never
have
anything
nicer
to
eat
than
this
not
nicer
than
this
i
exclaimed
why
my
dear
child
thousands
not
in
germany
only
but
in
france
and
england
never
taste
anything
as
good
the
little
girl
opened
her
eyes
there
are
salutary
lessons
to
be
learnt
from
even
the
mildest
experience
of
roughing
it
suddenly
nora
eyes
fell
on
a
little
parcel
in
blue
paper
it
was
lying
on
one
of
the
shelves
of
the
stove
which
as
in
most
german
rooms
stood
out
a
little
from
the
wall
and
in
its
summer
idleness
was
a
convenient
receptacle
for
odds
and
ends
this
stove
was
a
high
one
of
iron
it
stood
between
the
door
and
the
wall
on
the
same
side
as
the
door
and
was
the
most
conspicuous
object
in
the
room
mamma
she
exclaimed
there
is
the
parcel
you
brought
away
from
the
china
place
what
is
it
i
wish
you
would
show
it
me
i
gave
a
little
exclamation
of
annoyance
frau
von
walden
has
forgotten
it
i
said
for
my
friend
returning
straight
to
kronberg
had
offered
to
take
it
home
for
me
in
her
bag
for
fear
of
accidents
it
does
not
matter
i
added
i
will
pack
it
among
our
soft
things
it
is
a
very
pretty
cup
and
saucer
but
i
will
show
it
to
you
at
kronberg
for
it
is
so
nicely
wrapped
up
now
i
am
going
downstairs
to
order
the
and
we
can
walk
about
for
an
hour
or
two
the
children
came
with
me
i
had
some
trouble
in
disinterring
the
landlord
but
at
last
i
found
him
of
course
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
hanging
about
the
premises
he
listened
to
me
civilly
enough
but
when
i
waited
for
his
reply
as
to
whether
the
would
be
ready
about
twelve
he
calmly
regarded
me
without
speaking
i
repeated
my
inquiry
at
twelve
he
said
calmly
yes
no
doubt
the
gracious
lady
might
as
well
fix
twelve
as
any
other
hour
for
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
horse
much
less
an
to
be
had
at
silberbach
i
stared
at
him
in
my
turn
no
horse
no
carriage
to
be
had
how
do
people
ever
get
away
from
here
then
i
said
they
do
get
away
that
is
to
say
if
they
come
at
all
they
go
as
they
came
in
the
carriage
that
brought
them
otherwise
they
neither
come
nor
go
the
lady
came
on
foot
she
can
go
on
foot
otherwise
she
can
stay
there
seemed
something
sinister
in
his
words
a
horrible
ridiculous
feeling
came
over
me
that
we
were
caught
in
a
net
as
it
were
and
doomed
to
stay
at
silberbach
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
but
i
looked
at
the
man
he
was
simply
stolid
and
indifferent
i
did
not
believe
then
nor
do
i
now
that
he
was
anything
worse
than
sulky
and
uncivilised
he
did
not
even
care
to
have
us
as
his
visitors
he
had
no
wish
to
retain
us
nor
to
speed
us
on
our
way
had
we
remained
at
the
katze
from
that
day
to
this
i
do
believe
he
would
have
ever
inquired
what
we
stayed
for
i
walk
back
to
seeberg
i
said
half
indignantly
we
are
too
tired
nor
would
it
be
safe
through
the
forest
alone
with
two
children
the
landlord
knocked
some
ashes
off
his
pipe
there
may
be
an
going
that
way
next
week
he
observed
next
week
i
repeated
then
a
sudden
idea
struck
me
is
there
a
here
i
said
of
course
there
was
a
where
can
one
go
in
germany
where
there
is
not
a
post
and
telegraph
office
the
telegraph
officials
must
be
sadly
overworked
here
i
said
to
myself
but
as
far
as
mine
host
was
concerned
i
satisfied
myself
with
obtaining
the
locality
of
the
and
with
something
like
a
ray
of
hope
i
turned
to
look
for
the
children
they
had
been
amusing
themselves
with
the
piano
in
the
now
empty
room
but
as
i
called
to
them
reggie
ran
out
with
a
very
red
face
i
wish
i
were
a
man
mamma
fancy
a
peasant
one
of
those
men
who
were
drinking
beer
came
and
put
his
arm
around
nora
as
she
was
playing
spielst
he
said
and
i
believe
he
meant
to
kiss
her
if
i
had
shaken
my
fist
at
him
yes
indeed
mamma
said
nora
equally
but
more
calmly
indignant
i
certainly
think
the
sooner
we
get
away
the
better
i
had
to
tell
them
of
my
discomfiture
but
ended
with
my
new
idea
if
there
is
a
i
said
the
mail
must
stop
there
and
the
mail
takes
passengers
but
arrived
at
the
neat
little
to
reach
which
without
a
most
tremendous
round
we
had
to
climb
up
a
really
precipitous
path
so
called
over
the
stones
and
rocks
in
front
of
the
inn
new
dismay
awaited
us
the
postmaster
was
a
very
old
man
but
of
a
very
different
type
from
our
host
he
was
sorry
to
disappoint
us
but
the
mail
only
stopped
here
for
all
must
begin
their
journey
at
i
forget
where
leagues
off
on
the
other
side
from
silberbach
we
wanted
to
get
away
he
was
not
surprised
had
we
come
for
no
one
ever
came
here
were
we
americans
staying
at
the
katze
good
heavens
a
rough
place
i
should
rather
think
so
and
this
last
piece
of
information
fairly
overcame
him
he
evidently
felt
he
must
come
to
the
rescue
of
these
poor
babes
in
the
wood
come
up
when
the
mail
passes
from
seeberg
this
evening
at
seven
and
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
with
the
conductor
if
he
to
have
no
passengers
he
stretch
a
point
and
take
you
in
no
one
will
be
the
wiser
oh
thanks
thanks
i
cried
of
course
i
will
pay
anything
he
likes
to
ask
no
need
for
that
he
is
a
and
will
not
cheat
you
we
shall
be
here
at
seven
then
i
would
rather
have
started
to
walk
than
stayed
here
indefinitely
not
anyway
we
shall
have
a
storm
he
said
looking
up
to
the
sky
adieu
wiedersehen
i
wish
we
had
not
to
stay
another
night
here
i
said
still
morning
will
soon
come
we
spent
the
day
as
best
we
could
there
was
literally
nothing
to
see
nowhere
to
go
except
back
into
the
forest
whence
we
had
come
nor
dared
we
go
far
for
the
day
grew
more
and
more
sultry
the
strange
ominous
silence
that
precedes
a
storm
came
on
adding
to
our
feelings
of
restlessness
and
depression
and
by
about
two
having
ventured
out
again
after
dinner
we
were
driven
in
by
the
first
great
drops
huddled
together
in
our
cheerless
little
room
we
watched
the
breaking
loose
of
the
storm
demons
i
am
not
affected
by
thunder
and
lightning
nor
do
i
dread
them
but
what
a
storm
that
was
thunder
lightning
howling
wind
and
rain
like
no
rain
i
had
ever
seen
before
all
mingled
together
an
hour
after
it
began
a
cart
standing
high
and
dry
in
the
steep
village
street
was
hidden
by
water
to
above
the
top
of
the
wheels
a
little
more
and
it
would
have
floated
like
a
boat
but
by
about
five
things
calmed
down
the
few
peasants
came
out
of
their
houses
and
gazed
about
them
as
if
to
see
what
damage
had
been
done
perhaps
it
was
not
much
after
all
they
seemed
to
take
it
quietly
enough
and
by
six
all
special
signs
of
disturbance
had
disappeared
the
torrents
melted
away
as
if
by
magic
only
a
strange
heavy
mist
began
to
rise
enveloping
everything
so
that
we
could
hardly
believe
the
evening
was
yet
so
early
i
looked
at
my
watch
six
we
must
mist
or
no
mist
go
up
to
the
but
i
do
mind
going
alone
dears
no
no
mamma
i
go
with
you
to
take
care
of
you
said
reggie
but
nora
need
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
said
the
little
girl
i
have
one
or
two
buttons
to
sew
on
and
i
still
rather
tired
and
knowing
she
was
never
timid
about
being
left
alone
thinking
we
should
be
absent
half
an
hour
at
most
i
agreed
but
the
half
hour
lengthened
into
an
hour
then
into
an
hour
and
a
half
before
the
weary
mail
made
its
appearance
the
road
through
the
forest
must
be
all
but
impassable
our
old
friend
told
us
but
oh
how
tired
reggie
and
i
were
of
waiting
though
all
the
time
never
a
thought
of
uneasiness
with
regard
to
crossed
my
mind
and
when
the
mail
did
come
delayed
as
the
postmaster
had
suspected
the
good
result
of
his
negotiations
made
us
forget
all
our
troubles
for
the
conductor
all
but
to
take
us
the
next
morning
in
consideration
of
a
very
reasonable
extra
payment
it
was
most
unlikely
he
would
have
any
certainly
not
many
passengers
we
must
be
there
at
the
by
nine
baggage
and
all
for
he
dared
not
wait
a
moment
and
he
would
do
his
best
through
the
evening
dusk
now
fast
replacing
the
scattered
mist
reggie
and
i
light
of
heart
stumbled
down
the
rocky
path
how
pleased
nora
will
be
she
will
be
wondering
what
has
come
over
us
i
said
as
the
katze
came
in
view
but
what
is
that
reggie
running
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
house
is
it
a
sheep
or
a
big
white
dog
or
or
a
child
can
it
be
nora
and
no
cloak
or
hat
and
so
damp
and
chilly
as
it
is
how
can
she
be
so
foolish
and
with
a
vague
uneasiness
i
hurried
on
yes
it
was
nora
there
was
light
enough
to
see
her
face
what
had
happened
to
my
little
girl
she
was
white
no
not
white
ghastly
her
eyes
looked
glassy
and
yet
as
if
drawn
into
her
head
her
whole
bright
fearless
bearing
was
gone
she
clutched
me
convulsively
as
if
she
would
never
again
let
me
go
her
voice
was
so
hoarse
that
i
could
scarcely
distinguish
what
she
said
send
reggie
in
he
must
not
hear
were
her
first
words
of
rare
unselfishness
and
presence
of
mind
reggie
i
said
tell
the
maid
to
take
candles
up
to
our
room
and
take
off
your
wet
boots
at
once
my
children
are
obedient
he
was
off
instantly
then
nora
went
on
still
in
a
strained
painful
whisper
mamma
there
has
been
a
in
our
room
and
did
that
peasant
frighten
you
again
dear
oh
i
am
so
sorry
i
left
you
for
my
mind
at
once
reverted
to
the
man
whom
reggie
had
shaken
his
fist
at
that
morning
no
no
not
that
i
would
not
have
minded
but
mamma
reggie
must
never
know
it
he
is
so
little
he
could
not
bear
it
mamma
it
was
a
man
it
was
oh
mamma
i
have
seen
a
part
ii
a
ghost
i
repeated
holding
the
poor
trembling
little
thing
more
closely
i
think
my
first
sensation
was
a
sort
of
rage
at
whomever
or
whatever
ghost
or
living
being
had
frightened
her
so
terribly
oh
nora
darling
it
could
be
a
ghost
tell
me
about
it
and
i
will
try
to
find
out
what
it
was
or
would
you
rather
try
to
forget
about
it
just
now
and
tell
me
afterwards
you
are
shivering
so
dreadfully
i
get
you
warm
first
of
all
but
let
me
tell
you
mamma
i
tell
you
she
entreated
piteously
if
you
explain
it
i
should
be
so
glad
but
i
am
afraid
you
ca
and
again
a
shudder
passed
through
her
i
saw
it
was
better
to
let
her
tell
it
i
had
by
this
time
drawn
her
inside
a
door
in
front
stood
open
and
a
bright
fire
caught
my
eyes
it
was
the
kitchen
and
the
most
room
in
the
house
i
peeped
in
there
was
no
one
there
but
from
an
inner
room
we
heard
the
voice
of
the
landlady
hushing
her
baby
to
sleep
come
to
the
fire
nora
i
said
just
then
reggie
came
clattering
downstairs
followed
by
lieschen
the
taciturn
maid
of
the
inn
she
has
taken
a
candle
upstairs
mamma
but
i
not
taken
off
my
boots
for
there
a
little
calf
she
says
in
the
stable
and
going
to
show
it
me
may
i
go
yes
but
do
stay
long
i
said
my
opinion
of
the
sombre
lieschen
improving
considerably
and
when
they
were
out
of
hearing
now
nora
dear
tell
me
what
frightened
you
so
mamma
she
said
a
little
less
white
and
shivering
by
now
but
still
with
the
strange
strained
look
in
her
eyes
that
i
could
not
bear
to
see
it
have
been
a
real
man
listen
mamma
when
you
and
reggie
went
i
got
out
a
needle
and
thread
out
of
your
little
bag
and
first
i
mended
a
hole
in
my
glove
and
then
i
took
off
one
of
my
boots
the
ones
you
know
to
sew
a
button
on
i
soon
finished
it
and
then
without
putting
my
boot
on
i
sat
there
looking
out
of
the
window
and
wondering
if
you
and
reggie
would
soon
be
back
then
i
thought
perhaps
i
could
see
if
you
were
coming
better
from
the
window
of
the
place
outside
our
room
where
the
hay
and
bags
of
flour
are
i
think
i
forgot
to
say
that
to
get
to
our
room
we
had
to
cross
at
the
top
of
the
stair
a
sort
of
landing
along
one
side
of
which
as
nora
said
great
bags
of
flour
or
grain
and
trusses
of
hay
were
ranged
this
place
had
a
window
with
a
somewhat
more
extended
view
than
that
of
our
room
i
went
there
still
without
my
boot
and
i
knelt
in
front
of
the
window
some
time
looking
up
the
rough
path
and
wishing
you
would
come
but
i
was
not
the
least
dull
or
lonely
i
was
only
a
little
tired
at
last
i
got
tired
of
watching
there
and
i
thought
i
would
come
back
to
our
room
and
look
for
something
to
do
the
door
was
not
closed
but
i
think
i
had
half
drawn
it
to
as
i
came
out
i
pushed
it
open
and
went
in
and
then
i
seemed
to
feel
there
was
something
that
had
not
been
there
before
and
i
looked
up
and
just
beside
the
stove
the
door
opens
the
stove
you
know
and
so
it
had
hidden
it
for
a
moment
as
it
were
there
mamma
a
i
saw
him
as
plainly
as
i
see
you
he
was
staring
at
the
stove
afterwards
i
saw
it
must
have
been
at
your
little
blue
paper
parcel
he
was
a
gentleman
mamma
quite
young
i
saw
his
coat
it
was
cut
like
george
norman
i
think
he
must
have
been
an
englishman
his
coat
was
dark
and
bound
with
a
little
very
narrow
ribbon
binding
i
have
seen
coats
like
that
he
had
a
dark
blue
his
dress
all
looked
neat
and
careful
like
what
all
gentlemen
are
i
saw
all
that
mamma
before
i
clearly
saw
his
face
he
was
tall
and
had
fair
hair
i
saw
that
at
once
but
i
was
not
frightened
just
at
first
i
did
not
even
wonder
how
he
have
got
into
the
room
now
i
see
he
without
my
knowing
my
first
thought
it
seems
so
silly
and
nora
here
smiled
a
little
my
first
thought
was
he
will
see
i
have
no
boot
on
which
was
very
characteristic
of
the
child
for
nora
was
a
very
proper
little
girl
and
just
as
i
thought
that
seemed
to
know
i
was
there
for
he
slowly
turned
his
head
from
the
stove
and
looked
at
me
and
then
i
saw
his
face
oh
mamma
was
there
anything
frightening
about
it
i
said
i
do
know
the
child
went
on
it
was
not
like
any
face
i
ever
saw
and
yet
it
does
not
strange
he
had
nice
rather
wavy
fair
hair
and
i
think
he
must
his
eyes
were
blue
and
he
had
a
little
fair
moustache
but
he
was
so
pale
and
a
look
over
all
that
i
ca
describe
and
his
eyes
when
he
looked
at
me
not
to
see
and
yet
they
turned
on
me
they
looked
dreadfully
sad
and
though
they
were
so
close
to
me
as
if
they
were
miles
and
miles
away
then
his
lips
parted
slightly
very
slightly
as
if
he
were
going
to
speak
mamma
nora
went
on
impressively
they
would
have
spoken
if
had
said
the
least
word
i
felt
they
would
but
just
then
and
remember
mamma
it
could
have
been
yet
two
seconds
since
i
came
in
i
had
yet
had
to
get
frightened
just
then
there
came
over
me
the
most
awful
feeling
i
it
was
not
a
real
man
and
i
seemed
to
hear
myself
saying
inside
my
mind
is
a
ghost
and
while
i
seemed
to
be
saying
it
i
had
not
moved
my
eyes
while
i
looked
at
him
he
disappeared
no
mamma
he
did
not
even
disappear
he
was
just
longer
i
was
staring
at
nothing
then
came
a
sort
of
wild
fear
i
turned
and
rushed
downstairs
even
without
my
boot
and
all
the
way
the
horrible
feeling
was
that
even
though
he
was
no
longer
there
he
might
still
be
coming
after
me
i
should
not
have
cared
if
there
had
been
twenty
tipsy
peasants
downstairs
but
i
found
lieschen
of
course
i
said
nothing
to
her
i
only
asked
her
to
come
up
with
a
light
to
help
me
to
find
my
boot
and
as
soon
as
i
had
put
it
on
i
came
outside
and
ran
up
and
down
it
was
a
long
time
i
think
till
you
and
reggie
came
at
last
mamma
you
explain
it
how
i
longed
to
be
able
to
do
so
but
i
would
not
deceive
the
child
besides
it
would
have
been
useless
no
dear
as
yet
i
can
not
but
i
will
try
to
understand
it
there
are
several
ways
it
may
be
explained
have
you
ever
heard
of
optical
delusions
nora
i
am
not
sure
you
must
tell
me
and
she
looked
at
me
so
appealingly
and
with
such
readiness
to
believe
whatever
i
told
her
that
i
felt
i
would
give
anything
to
restore
her
to
her
former
happy
fearlessness
but
just
then
reggie
came
in
from
the
stable
we
must
go
upstairs
i
said
and
lieschen
turning
to
her
bring
up
our
supper
at
once
we
are
leaving
very
early
morning
and
we
will
go
early
to
bed
oh
mamma
whispered
nora
if
only
we
had
not
to
stay
all
night
in
that
room
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
she
was
thankful
to
hear
of
the
success
of
our
expedition
to
the
during
supper
we
of
course
on
reggie
account
said
nothing
of
nora
fright
but
as
soon
as
it
was
over
reggie
declaring
himself
very
sleepy
we
got
him
undressed
and
put
to
bed
on
the
settee
originally
intended
for
nora
he
was
asleep
in
five
minutes
and
then
nora
and
i
did
our
utmost
to
arrive
at
the
explanation
we
so
longed
for
we
thoroughly
examined
the
room
there
was
no
other
entrance
no
cupboard
of
any
kind
even
i
tried
to
imagine
that
some
of
our
travelling
cloaks
or
shawls
hanging
on
the
back
of
a
chair
might
in
the
uncertain
light
have
taken
imaginary
proportions
that
the
stove
itself
might
have
cast
a
shadow
we
had
not
before
observed
i
suggested
everything
but
in
vain
nothing
shook
nora
conviction
that
she
had
seen
something
to
be
explained
for
the
light
was
uncertain
just
then
she
maintained
the
mist
had
gone
and
it
had
not
begun
to
get
dark
and
then
i
saw
him
plainly
if
it
had
been
a
fancy
ghost
it
would
have
looked
like
that
it
would
have
had
a
long
white
thing
floating
over
it
and
a
face
like
a
skeleton
perhaps
but
to
see
somebody
just
like
a
regular
gentleman
i
could
never
have
that
there
was
a
good
deal
in
what
she
said
i
had
to
give
up
my
suggestions
and
i
tried
to
give
nora
some
idea
of
what
are
called
optical
delusions
though
my
own
comprehension
of
the
theory
was
of
the
vaguest
she
listened
but
i
do
think
my
words
had
much
weight
and
at
last
i
told
her
i
thought
she
had
better
go
to
bed
and
try
to
sleep
i
saw
she
shrank
from
the
idea
but
it
had
to
be
we
ca
sit
up
all
night
i
suppose
she
said
but
i
wish
we
could
i
am
so
dreadfully
afraid
of
waking
in
the
night
and
and
him
there
would
you
like
to
sleep
in
my
bed
though
it
is
so
tiny
i
could
make
room
and
put
you
inside
i
said
nora
looked
wistfully
at
the
haven
of
refuge
but
her
good
sense
and
considerateness
for
me
came
to
the
front
no
she
said
neither
of
us
would
sleep
and
you
would
be
tired
i
will
get
into
my
own
bed
and
i
try
to
sleep
mamma
and
listen
nora
if
you
are
the
least
frightened
in
the
night
or
if
you
ca
sleep
call
out
to
me
without
hesitation
i
am
sure
to
wake
often
and
i
will
speak
to
you
from
time
to
time
that
was
the
longest
night
of
my
life
the
first
part
was
not
the
worst
by
what
i
really
thought
a
fortunate
chance
it
was
a
club
night
of
some
kind
at
silberbach
a
musical
club
of
course
and
all
the
peasants
of
the
countryside
assembled
in
the
sanded
parlour
of
the
katze
the
noise
was
something
indescribable
for
though
there
may
have
been
some
good
voices
among
them
they
were
drowned
in
the
din
but
though
it
prevented
us
from
sleeping
it
also
fairly
drove
away
all
ghostly
alarms
by
twelve
or
thereabouts
the
party
seemed
to
disperse
and
all
grew
still
then
came
some
hours
i
can
never
forget
there
was
faint
moonlight
by
fits
and
starts
and
i
not
only
found
it
impossible
to
sleep
i
found
it
impossible
to
keep
my
eyes
shut
some
irresistible
fascination
seemed
to
force
them
open
and
obliged
me
ever
and
anon
to
turn
in
the
direction
of
the
stove
from
which
however
before
going
to
bed
i
had
removed
the
blue
paper
parcel
and
each
time
i
did
so
i
said
to
myself
am
i
going
to
see
that
figure
standing
there
as
nora
saw
it
shall
i
remain
sane
if
i
do
shall
i
scream
out
will
it
look
at
in
turn
with
its
sad
unearthly
eyes
will
it
speak
if
it
moves
across
the
room
and
comes
near
me
or
if
i
see
it
going
towards
nora
or
leaning
over
my
reggie
sleeping
there
in
his
innocence
misdoubting
of
no
fateful
presence
near
what
oh
what
i
do
for
in
my
heart
of
hearts
though
i
would
not
own
it
to
nora
i
felt
convinced
that
what
she
had
seen
was
no
living
human
being
whence
it
had
come
or
i
could
not
tell
but
in
the
quiet
of
the
night
i
had
thought
of
what
the
woman
at
the
china
factory
had
told
us
of
the
young
englishman
who
had
bought
the
other
cup
who
had
promised
to
write
and
never
done
so
what
had
become
of
him
if
i
said
to
myself
if
i
had
the
slightest
reason
to
doubt
his
being
at
this
moment
alive
and
well
in
his
own
country
as
he
pretty
certainly
is
i
should
really
begin
to
think
he
had
been
robbed
and
murdered
by
our
surly
landlord
and
that
his
spirit
had
appeared
to
us
the
first
compatriots
who
have
passed
this
way
since
most
likely
to
tell
the
story
i
really
think
i
must
have
been
a
little
some
part
of
that
night
my
poor
nora
i
am
certain
never
slept
but
i
can
only
hope
her
imagination
was
less
wildly
at
work
than
mine
from
time
to
time
i
spoke
to
her
and
every
time
she
was
awake
for
she
always
answered
without
hesitation
i
am
quite
comfortable
dear
mamma
and
i
do
think
i
am
very
frightened
or
else
i
have
not
slept
much
but
i
have
said
my
prayers
a
great
many
times
and
all
the
hymns
i
could
remember
do
mind
about
me
mamma
and
do
try
to
sleep
i
watched
the
dawn
slowly
breaking
from
where
i
lay
i
could
see
through
the
window
the
high
mound
of
rough
stones
and
fragments
of
rock
that
i
have
described
at
its
foot
there
was
a
low
wall
loosely
constructed
of
these
same
unhewn
blocks
and
the
shapes
that
evolved
themselves
out
of
this
wall
beside
which
grew
two
or
three
stunted
trees
were
more
grotesque
and
extraordinary
than
i
could
describe
they
varied
like
the
colours
in
a
kaleidoscope
with
the
wavering
and
increasing
light
at
one
time
it
seemed
to
me
that
one
of
the
trees
was
a
gipsy
woman
enveloped
in
a
cloak
extending
her
arm
towards
me
threateningly
at
another
two
weird
dogs
seemed
to
be
fighting
together
but
however
fantastic
and
fearsome
had
been
these
strange
effects
of
light
and
fancy
mingled
together
i
should
not
have
minded
i
knew
what
they
were
it
was
a
relief
to
have
anything
to
look
at
which
could
keep
my
eyes
from
constantly
turning
in
the
direction
of
that
black
iron
stove
i
fell
asleep
at
last
though
not
for
long
when
i
woke
it
was
bright
morning
fresher
and
brighter
i
felt
as
i
threw
open
the
window
than
the
day
before
with
the
greatest
thankfulness
that
the
night
was
over
at
last
as
soon
as
i
was
dressed
i
began
to
put
our
little
belongings
together
and
then
turned
to
awake
the
children
nora
was
sleeping
quietly
it
seemed
a
pity
to
arouse
her
for
it
was
not
much
past
six
but
i
heard
the
people
stirring
about
downstairs
and
i
had
a
feverish
desire
to
get
away
for
though
the
daylight
had
dispersed
much
of
the
eerie
impression
of
nora
fright
there
was
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
almost
of
insecurity
left
in
my
mind
since
recalling
the
incident
of
the
young
man
who
had
visited
the
china
factory
how
did
i
know
but
that
some
harm
had
really
come
to
him
in
this
very
place
there
was
certainly
nothing
about
the
landlord
to
inspire
confidence
at
best
it
was
a
strange
and
unpleasant
coincidence
the
evening
before
i
had
half
thought
of
inquiring
of
the
landlord
or
his
wife
or
even
of
lieschen
if
any
english
had
ever
before
stayed
at
the
katze
if
assured
by
them
that
we
were
the
first
or
at
least
the
first
in
their
time
it
would
i
thought
help
to
assure
nora
that
the
ghost
had
really
been
a
delusion
of
some
kind
but
then
again
supposing
the
people
of
the
inn
hesitated
to
reply
supposing
the
landlord
to
be
really
in
any
way
guilty
and
my
inquiries
were
to
rouse
his
suspicions
would
i
not
be
risking
dangerous
enmity
besides
strengthening
the
painful
impression
left
on
my
own
mind
and
this
corroboration
of
her
own
fear
might
be
instinctively
suspected
by
nora
even
if
i
told
her
nothing
no
i
decided
better
leave
it
a
mystery
in
any
case
till
we
are
safely
away
from
here
for
allowing
that
these
people
are
perfectly
innocent
and
harmless
their
even
telling
me
simply
like
the
woman
at
grünstein
that
such
a
person
been
here
that
he
had
fallen
ill
possibly
died
here
i
would
rather
not
know
it
it
is
certainly
not
probable
that
it
was
so
they
would
have
been
pretty
sure
to
gossip
about
any
occurrence
of
the
kind
taciturn
though
they
are
the
wife
would
have
talked
of
it
to
me
she
is
more
genial
than
the
others
for
i
had
had
a
little
kindly
chat
with
her
the
day
before
of
what
every
mother
of
her
class
at
least
is
ready
to
talk
about
the
baby
a
pretty
baby
too
though
the
last
she
informed
me
with
a
sort
of
melancholy
pride
of
four
she
had
buried
using
the
same
expression
in
her
rough
german
as
a
lancashire
factory
hand
or
an
irish
peasant
woman
one
after
the
other
certainly
silberbach
was
not
a
cheerful
or
cheering
spot
no
no
i
made
up
my
mind
i
would
rather
at
present
know
nothing
even
if
there
is
anything
to
know
i
can
the
more
honestly
endeavour
to
remove
the
impression
left
on
nora
the
little
girl
was
so
easily
awakened
that
i
was
half
inclined
to
doubt
if
she
had
not
been
shamming
out
of
filial
devotion
she
looked
ill
still
but
infinitely
better
than
the
night
before
and
she
so
eagerly
agreed
with
me
in
my
wish
to
leave
the
house
as
soon
as
possible
that
i
felt
sure
it
was
the
best
thing
to
do
reggie
woke
up
rosy
and
beaming
evidently
no
ghosts
had
troubled
night
repose
there
was
something
consoling
and
satisfactory
in
seeing
him
quite
as
happy
and
hearty
as
in
his
own
english
nursery
but
though
he
had
no
uncanny
reasons
like
us
for
disliking
silberbach
he
was
quite
as
cordial
in
his
readiness
to
leave
it
we
got
hold
of
lieschen
and
asked
for
our
breakfast
at
once
as
i
had
told
the
landlady
the
night
before
that
we
were
leaving
very
early
our
bill
came
up
with
the
coffee
it
was
i
must
say
moderate
in
the
extreme
ten
or
twelve
marks
if
i
remember
rightly
for
two
nights
lodging
and
two
days
board
for
three
people
and
such
as
it
was
they
had
given
us
of
their
best
i
felt
a
little
twinge
of
conscience
when
i
said
to
the
poor
woman
for
having
harboured
any
doubts
of
the
establishment
but
when
the
gruff
landlord
standing
outside
the
door
smoking
of
course
nodded
a
surly
adieu
in
return
to
our
parting
greeting
my
feeling
of
unutterable
thankfulness
that
we
were
not
to
spend
another
night
under
his
roof
regained
the
ascendant
perhaps
he
is
offended
at
my
not
having
told
him
how
i
mean
to
get
away
notwithstanding
his
stupidity
about
it
i
said
to
myself
as
we
passed
him
but
no
there
was
no
look
of
vindictiveness
of
malice
of
even
annoyance
on
his
dark
face
nay
more
i
could
almost
have
fancied
there
was
the
shadow
of
a
smile
as
reggie
tugged
at
his
tam
o
shanter
by
way
of
a
final
salute
that
landlord
was
really
one
of
the
most
incomprehensible
human
beings
it
has
ever
been
my
fate
to
come
across
in
fact
or
fiction
we
had
retained
lieschen
to
carry
our
modest
baggage
to
the
and
having
deposited
it
at
the
side
of
the
road
just
where
the
coach
stopped
she
took
her
leave
apparently
more
than
satisfied
with
the
small
sum
of
money
i
gave
her
and
civilly
wishing
us
a
pleasant
journey
but
though
less
gruff
she
was
quite
as
impassive
as
the
landlord
she
never
asked
where
we
were
going
if
we
were
likely
ever
to
return
again
and
like
her
master
as
i
said
had
we
been
staying
there
still
i
do
not
believe
she
would
ever
have
made
an
inquiry
or
expressed
the
slightest
astonishment
there
is
really
something
very
queer
about
silberbach
i
could
not
help
saying
to
nora
both
about
the
place
and
the
people
they
almost
give
one
the
feeling
that
they
are
and
yet
they
evidently
are
not
this
last
day
or
two
i
seem
to
have
been
living
in
a
sort
of
dream
or
nightmare
and
i
shall
not
get
over
it
altogether
till
we
are
fairly
out
of
the
place
and
though
she
said
little
i
felt
sure
the
child
understood
me
we
were
of
course
far
far
too
early
for
the
post
the
old
man
came
out
of
his
house
and
seemed
amused
at
our
haste
to
be
gone
i
am
afraid
silberbach
has
not
taken
your
fancy
he
said
well
no
wonder
i
think
it
is
the
dreariest
place
i
ever
saw
then
you
do
not
belong
to
it
have
you
not
been
here
long
i
asked
he
shook
his
head
only
a
few
months
and
i
hope
to
get
removed
soon
he
said
so
could
have
told
me
nothing
evidently
it
is
too
lonely
here
there
is
not
a
creature
in
the
place
who
ever
touches
a
book
they
are
all
as
dull
and
stupid
as
they
can
be
but
then
they
are
very
poor
and
they
live
on
here
from
year
end
to
year
end
barely
able
to
earn
their
daily
bread
poverty
degrades
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
whatever
the
wise
men
may
say
a
few
generations
of
it
makes
men
little
better
than
he
stopped
than
i
asked
than
the
old
philosopher
of
the
went
on
pardon
the
expression
than
pigs
there
were
two
or
three
of
the
fraternity
grubbing
about
at
the
side
of
the
road
they
may
have
suggested
the
comparison
i
could
hardly
help
smiling
but
i
have
travelled
a
good
deal
in
germany
i
said
and
i
have
never
anywhere
found
the
people
so
stupid
and
stolid
and
ungenial
as
here
perhaps
not
he
said
still
there
are
many
places
like
this
only
naturally
they
are
not
the
places
strangers
visit
it
is
never
so
bad
where
there
are
a
few
country
houses
near
for
nowadays
it
must
be
allowed
it
is
seldom
but
that
the
gentry
take
some
interest
in
the
people
it
is
a
pity
no
rich
man
takes
a
fancy
to
silberbach
i
said
that
day
will
never
come
the
best
thing
would
be
for
a
railway
to
be
cut
through
the
place
but
that
too
is
not
likely
then
the
old
postmaster
turned
into
his
garden
inviting
us
civilly
to
wait
there
or
in
the
office
if
we
preferred
but
we
liked
better
to
stay
outside
for
just
above
the
there
was
a
rather
tempting
little
wood
much
prettier
than
anything
to
be
seen
on
the
other
side
of
the
village
and
nora
and
i
sat
there
quietly
on
the
stumps
of
some
old
trees
while
reggie
found
a
pleasing
distraction
in
alternately
chasing
and
making
friends
with
a
party
of
ducks
which
for
reasons
best
known
to
themselves
had
deserted
their
native
element
and
come
for
a
stroll
in
the
woods
from
where
we
sat
we
looked
down
on
our
late
habitation
we
could
almost
distinguish
the
landlord
slouching
figure
and
poor
lieschen
with
a
pail
of
water
slung
at
each
side
as
she
came
in
from
the
well
what
a
life
i
could
not
help
saying
day
after
day
nothing
but
work
i
suppose
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
they
grow
dull
and
stolid
poor
things
then
my
thoughts
reverted
to
what
up
here
in
the
sunshine
and
the
fresh
morning
air
and
with
the
pleasant
excitement
of
going
away
i
had
a
little
forgotten
the
strange
experience
of
the
evening
before
it
was
difficult
for
me
now
to
realise
that
i
had
been
so
affected
by
it
i
felt
as
if
i
wished
i
could
see
the
poor
ghost
for
myself
and
learn
if
there
was
aught
we
could
do
to
serve
or
satisfy
him
for
in
the
old
orthodox
there
is
always
some
reason
for
these
eerie
wanderers
returning
to
the
world
they
have
left
but
when
i
turned
to
nora
and
saw
her
dear
little
face
still
white
and
drawn
and
with
an
expression
that
it
had
never
worn
before
i
felt
thankful
that
the
unbidden
visitor
had
attempted
no
communication
it
might
have
sent
her
out
of
her
mind
i
thought
why
if
he
had
anything
to
say
did
he
appear
to
her
poor
child
and
not
to
me
though
after
all
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
should
not
have
gone
out
of
my
mind
in
such
a
case
before
long
the
made
itself
heard
in
the
distance
we
hurried
down
our
hearts
beating
with
the
fear
of
possible
disappointment
it
was
all
right
however
there
were
passengers
and
nodding
adieu
to
our
old
friend
we
joyfully
mounted
into
our
places
and
were
bowled
away
to
seeberg
there
and
at
other
spots
in
its
pretty
neighbourhood
we
pleasantly
enough
spent
two
or
three
weeks
nora
by
degrees
recovered
her
roses
and
her
good
spirits
still
her
strange
experience
left
its
mark
on
her
she
was
never
again
quite
the
merry
thoughtless
utterly
fearless
child
she
had
been
i
tried
however
to
take
the
good
with
the
ill
remembering
that
childhood
can
not
last
for
ever
that
the
shock
possibly
helped
to
soften
and
modify
a
nature
that
might
have
been
too
daring
for
perfect
womanliness
still
more
wanting
perhaps
in
tenderness
and
sympathy
for
the
weaknesses
and
tremors
of
feebler
temperaments
at
kronberg
on
our
return
we
found
that
herr
von
walden
was
off
on
a
tour
to
the
italian
lakes
lutz
and
young
trachenfels
had
returned
to
their
studies
at
heidelberg
george
norman
had
gone
home
to
england
all
the
members
of
our
little
party
were
dispersed
except
frau
von
walden
to
her
and
to
ottilia
i
told
the
story
sitting
together
one
afternoon
over
our
coffee
when
nora
was
not
with
us
it
impressed
them
both
ottilia
could
not
resist
an
i
told
you
so
i
knew
i
felt
she
said
that
something
disagreeable
would
happen
to
you
there
i
never
will
forget
she
went
on
naïvely
the
dreary
dismal
impression
the
place
left
on
me
the
only
time
i
was
there
pouring
rain
and
universal
gloom
and
discomfort
we
had
to
wait
there
a
few
hours
to
get
one
of
the
horses
shod
once
when
i
was
driving
with
my
father
from
seeberg
to
marsfeldt
frau
von
walden
and
i
could
not
help
smiling
at
her
still
there
was
no
smiling
at
my
story
though
both
agreed
that
viewed
in
the
light
of
unexaggerated
common
sense
it
was
most
improbable
that
there
was
any
tragedy
mixed
up
with
the
disappearance
of
the
young
man
we
had
heard
of
at
grünstein
and
indeed
why
we
should
speak
of
his
i
do
know
said
frau
von
walden
he
did
not
write
to
send
the
order
he
had
spoken
of
that
was
all
no
doubt
he
is
very
happy
at
his
own
home
when
you
are
back
in
england
my
dear
you
must
try
to
find
him
out
perhaps
by
means
of
the
cup
and
then
when
nora
sees
him
and
finds
he
is
not
at
all
like
the
it
will
make
her
the
more
ready
to
think
it
was
really
only
some
i
must
admit
kind
of
optical
delusion
but
nora
has
never
heard
the
grünstein
story
and
is
not
to
hear
it
said
ottilia
and
england
is
a
wide
place
small
as
it
is
in
one
sense
i
said
still
if
i
come
across
the
young
man
i
half
think
i
would
tell
nora
the
whole
and
by
showing
her
how
imagination
had
dressed
it
up
i
think
i
could
perhaps
lessen
the
effect
on
her
of
what
she
thought
she
saw
it
would
prove
to
her
better
than
anything
the
tricks
that
fancy
may
play
us
and
in
the
meantime
if
you
take
my
advice
you
will
allude
to
it
as
little
as
possible
said
practical
ottilia
do
to
avoid
the
subject
but
manage
to
do
so
in
reality
shall
you
order
the
asked
frau
von
walden
i
hardly
think
so
i
am
out
of
conceit
of
it
somehow
i
said
and
it
might
remind
nora
of
the
blue
paper
parcel
i
think
i
shall
give
the
cup
and
saucer
to
my
sister
and
on
my
return
to
england
i
did
so
two
years
later
a
very
different
scene
from
quaint
old
kronberg
or
still
more
from
the
dreary
katze
at
silberbach
we
are
in
england
now
though
not
at
our
own
home
we
are
staying
my
children
and
i
two
older
girls
than
little
nora
and
nora
herself
though
hardly
now
to
be
described
as
little
with
my
sister
reggie
is
there
too
but
naturally
not
much
heard
of
for
it
is
the
summer
holidays
and
the
weather
is
delightful
it
is
august
again
a
typical
august
afternoon
though
a
trifle
too
hot
perhaps
for
some
people
this
time
two
years
ago
mamma
said
margaret
my
eldest
daughter
you
were
in
germany
with
nora
and
reggie
what
a
long
summer
that
seemed
it
is
so
much
nicer
to
be
all
together
i
should
like
to
go
to
kronberg
and
all
those
queer
places
said
lily
the
second
girl
especially
to
the
place
where
nora
saw
the
ghost
i
am
quite
sure
you
would
not
wish
to
there
i
replied
it
is
curious
that
you
should
speak
of
it
just
now
i
was
thinking
of
it
this
morning
it
was
just
two
years
yesterday
that
it
happened
we
were
sitting
at
afternoon
tea
on
the
lawn
outside
the
window
my
sister
her
husband
margaret
lily
and
nora
was
with
the
schoolroom
party
inside
how
queer
said
lily
you
do
think
nora
has
thought
of
it
i
asked
oh
no
i
am
sure
she
has
said
margaret
i
think
it
has
grown
vague
to
her
now
you
know
she
spoke
about
it
to
us
when
she
first
came
home
you
had
prepared
us
you
remember
mamma
and
told
us
not
to
make
too
much
of
it
the
first
year
after
she
think
of
it
she
told
me
she
was
dreadfully
frightened
all
that
day
for
fear
he
should
appear
again
but
since
then
i
think
she
has
gradually
forgotten
it
she
is
a
very
sensible
child
said
my
sister
and
she
is
especially
kind
and
sympathising
with
any
of
the
little
ones
who
seem
timid
i
found
her
sitting
beside
charlie
the
other
night
for
ever
so
long
because
he
heard
an
owl
hooting
outside
and
was
frightened
just
then
a
servant
came
out
of
the
house
and
said
something
to
my
he
got
up
at
once
it
is
grenfell
he
said
to
his
wife
and
a
friend
with
him
shall
i
bring
them
out
here
yes
it
would
really
be
a
pity
to
go
into
the
house
again
it
is
so
nice
out
here
she
replied
and
her
husband
went
to
meet
his
guests
he
appeared
again
in
a
minute
or
two
stepping
out
through
the
low
window
of
the
accompanied
by
the
two
gentlemen
grenfell
was
a
young
man
living
in
the
neighbourhood
whom
we
had
known
from
his
boyhood
the
stranger
he
introduced
to
us
as
sir
robert
masters
he
was
a
man
with
a
quiet
gentle
bearing
and
expression
you
will
have
some
tea
said
my
sister
after
the
first
few
words
of
greeting
had
passed
grenfell
declined
his
friend
accepted
go
into
the
lily
please
and
ring
for
a
cup
and
saucer
said
her
aunt
noting
the
deficiency
there
was
an
extra
one
but
some
one
has
poured
milk
into
the
saucer
it
surely
ca
have
been
you
mark
for
tiny
she
went
on
turning
to
her
husband
you
let
a
dog
drink
out
of
anything
we
drink
out
of
ourselves
my
looked
rather
comically
penitent
he
did
not
attempt
to
deny
the
charge
only
my
dear
you
must
allow
he
pleaded
that
we
do
not
drink
our
tea
out
of
the
on
what
trifling
links
hang
sometimes
important
results
had
it
not
been
for
mark
transgressing
in
the
matter
of
tiny
milk
we
should
never
have
learnt
the
circumstances
which
give
to
this
simple
relation
of
facts
valueless
in
itself
such
interest
speculative
and
suggestive
only
i
am
aware
as
it
may
be
found
to
possess
lily
in
the
meantime
had
disappeared
but
more
quickly
than
it
would
have
taken
her
to
ring
the
bell
and
await
the
servant
response
to
the
summons
she
was
back
again
carrying
something
carefully
in
her
hand
aunt
she
said
is
it
not
a
good
idea
as
you
have
a
i
do
suppose
tiny
used
the
spoon
did
he
i
thought
instead
of
ringing
for
another
i
would
bring
out
the
for
sir
robert
it
is
only
fair
to
use
it
for
once
poor
thing
and
just
as
we
have
been
speaking
about
it
oh
i
assure
you
it
is
not
dusty
as
my
sister
regarded
it
dubiously
it
was
inside
the
cabinet
still
all
the
same
a
little
hot
water
will
do
it
no
harm
said
her
aunt
provided
that
is
to
say
that
sir
robert
has
no
objection
to
drink
out
of
a
cup
with
such
a
name
attached
to
it
on
the
contrary
replied
he
i
shall
think
it
an
honour
but
you
will
i
trust
explain
the
meaning
of
the
name
to
me
it
puzzles
me
more
than
if
it
were
a
piece
of
ancient
china
a
cup
for
instance
for
i
see
it
is
not
old
though
it
is
very
pretty
and
i
suppose
uncommon
there
was
a
slight
tone
of
hesitation
about
the
last
word
which
struck
me
i
have
no
doubt
my
sister
will
be
ready
to
tell
you
all
there
is
to
tell
it
was
she
who
gave
me
the
cup
replied
the
lady
of
the
house
then
sir
robert
turned
to
me
looking
at
him
full
in
the
face
i
saw
that
there
was
a
thoughtful
look
in
his
eyes
which
redeemed
his
whole
appearance
from
the
somewhat
commonplace
gentlemanliness
which
was
all
i
had
before
observed
about
him
i
am
greatly
interested
in
these
subjects
he
said
it
would
be
very
kind
of
you
to
tell
me
the
whole
i
did
so
more
rapidly
and
succinctly
of
course
than
i
have
done
here
it
is
not
easy
to
play
the
part
of
narrator
with
five
or
six
pairs
of
eyes
fixed
upon
you
more
especially
when
the
owners
of
several
of
them
have
heard
the
story
a
good
many
times
before
and
are
quick
to
observe
the
slightest
discrepancy
however
unintentional
there
is
you
see
very
little
to
tell
i
said
in
conclusion
only
there
is
always
a
certain
amount
of
impressiveness
about
any
experience
of
the
kind
when
related
at
first
hand
undoubtedly
so
sir
robert
replied
thank
you
very
much
indeed
for
telling
it
me
he
spoke
with
perfect
courtesy
but
with
a
slight
absence
of
manner
his
eyes
fixed
rather
dreamily
on
the
cup
in
his
hand
he
seemed
as
if
trying
to
recall
or
recollect
something
there
should
be
a
sequel
to
that
story
said
grenfell
that
what
i
say
said
margaret
eagerly
it
will
be
too
stupid
if
we
never
hear
any
more
but
that
is
always
the
way
with
modern
ghost
stories
there
is
no
sense
or
meaning
in
them
the
ghosts
appear
to
people
who
never
knew
them
who
take
no
interest
in
them
as
it
were
and
then
they
have
nothing
to
say
there
is
no
it
is
all
purposeless
sir
robert
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
there
is
a
good
deal
in
what
you
say
he
replied
but
i
think
there
is
a
good
deal
also
to
be
deduced
from
the
very
fact
you
speak
of
for
it
is
a
fact
i
believe
what
you
call
the
meaninglessness
and
purposelessness
the
arbitrariness
one
may
say
of
modern
experiences
of
the
kind
are
the
surest
proofs
of
their
authenticity
long
ago
people
mixed
up
fact
and
fiction
their
imaginations
ran
riot
and
on
some
very
slight
foundation
often
no
doubt
genuine
though
slight
they
built
up
a
very
complete
and
thrilling
story
nowadays
we
consider
and
philosophise
we
want
to
get
to
the
root
and
reason
of
things
and
we
are
more
wary
of
exaggeration
the
result
is
that
the
only
genuine
ghosts
are
most
unsatisfactory
beings
they
appear
without
purpose
and
seem
to
be
what
in
fact
i
believe
they
always
are
irresponsible
purposeless
but
from
these
i
would
separate
the
class
of
ghost
stories
the
best
attested
and
most
impressive
those
that
have
to
do
with
the
moment
of
death
any
vision
that
appears
just
at
or
about
that
time
has
more
meaning
in
it
i
think
you
will
find
such
ghosts
appear
for
a
reason
if
no
other
than
that
of
intense
affection
which
draws
them
near
those
from
whom
they
are
to
be
separated
we
listened
attentively
to
this
long
explanation
though
by
no
means
fully
understanding
it
i
have
often
heard
i
said
that
the
class
of
ghost
stories
you
speak
of
are
the
only
thoroughly
authenticated
ones
and
i
think
one
is
naturally
more
inclined
to
believe
in
them
than
in
any
others
but
i
confess
i
do
not
in
the
least
understand
what
you
mean
by
speaking
of
ghosts
as
you
do
mean
that
though
at
the
moment
of
death
there
is
a
real
being
the
soul
in
fact
as
distinct
from
the
body
in
which
all
but
materialists
believe
that
this
has
no
permanent
existence
but
melts
away
by
degrees
till
it
becomes
an
irresponsible
purposeless
a
in
fact
i
think
i
heard
of
some
theory
of
the
kind
lately
in
a
french
book
but
it
shocked
and
repelled
me
so
that
i
tried
to
forget
it
just
as
well
believe
that
we
are
nothing
but
our
bodies
and
that
all
is
over
when
we
die
surely
you
do
mean
what
i
say
god
forbid
said
sir
robert
with
a
fervency
which
startled
while
it
reassured
me
it
is
my
profound
belief
that
not
only
we
are
something
more
than
our
bodies
but
that
our
bodies
are
the
merest
outer
dress
of
the
real
ourselves
it
is
also
my
profound
belief
that
at
death
we
the
real
we
either
enter
at
once
into
a
state
of
rest
temporarily
or
in
some
cases
for
i
do
not
believe
in
any
rule
independently
of
considerations
are
privileged
at
once
to
enter
upon
a
sphere
of
nobler
and
purer
labour
and
here
the
speaker
eyes
glowed
with
a
light
that
was
not
of
this
world
is
it
then
the
least
probable
is
it
not
altogether
discordant
with
our
sense
a
divine
gift
which
we
may
employ
fearlessly
to
suppose
that
these
real
freed
from
the
weight
of
their
discarded
garments
would
leave
either
their
blissful
repose
still
less
their
new
activities
to
come
back
to
wander
about
purposelessly
and
aimlessly
in
this
world
at
best
only
perplexing
and
alarming
such
as
may
perceive
them
is
it
not
contrary
to
all
we
find
of
the
wisdom
and
of
such
laws
as
we
know
something
about
i
have
often
thought
so
i
said
and
hitherto
this
has
led
me
to
be
very
sceptical
about
all
ghost
stories
but
they
are
often
true
so
far
as
they
go
he
replied
our
natures
are
much
more
complex
than
we
ourselves
understand
or
realise
i
can
not
now
go
at
all
thoroughly
into
the
subject
but
to
give
you
a
rough
idea
of
my
theory
can
you
not
imagine
a
sort
of
shadow
or
echo
of
ourselves
lingering
about
the
scenes
we
have
frequented
on
this
earth
which
under
certain
very
rare
conditions
the
state
of
the
atmosphere
among
others
may
be
perceptible
to
those
still
upon
with
this
present
body
to
attempt
a
simile
i
might
suggest
the
perfume
that
lingers
when
the
flowers
are
thrown
away
the
smoke
that
gradually
dissolves
after
the
lamp
is
extinguished
this
is
very
very
loosely
and
roughly
the
of
thing
i
mean
by
my
i
do
like
it
at
all
said
margaret
though
she
smiled
a
little
i
think
i
should
be
more
frightened
if
i
saw
that
kind
of
ghost
i
mean
if
i
thought
it
that
kind
than
by
a
good
honest
one
who
knew
what
it
was
about
and
meant
to
come
but
you
have
just
said
he
objected
that
they
never
do
seem
to
know
what
they
are
about
besides
why
should
you
be
frightened
our
fears
ourselves
in
fact
are
the
only
thing
we
really
need
be
frightened
of
our
weaknesses
and
ignorances
and
folly
there
was
great
truth
in
that
rather
ghastly
story
of
calderra
allegory
though
it
is
about
the
man
whose
evil
genius
was
himself
have
you
read
it
we
all
shook
our
heads
it
is
ignorance
that
frightens
us
he
went
on
in
this
instance
think
of
the
appearances
we
are
speaking
of
as
almost
of
the
nature
of
a
photograph
or
the
reflection
in
a
i
daresay
we
should
have
been
terrified
by
these
had
we
not
grown
used
to
them
did
we
not
know
what
they
are
somebody
said
lately
what
appalling
things
we
should
think
our
own
if
we
had
suddenly
for
the
first
time
become
aware
of
them
i
do
mind
so
much
said
margaret
when
you
speak
of
ghosts
as
a
sort
of
photograph
but
she
hesitated
pray
say
what
you
are
thinking
just
now
when
you
said
how
incredible
it
was
that
should
return
to
this
earth
you
only
spoke
of
good
people
did
you
not
in
his
turn
sir
robert
hesitated
it
is
difficult
to
draw
a
line
even
in
thought
between
good
and
bad
people
he
said
and
thank
god
it
is
not
for
us
to
do
so
my
maker
alone
i
stand
or
i
fall
there
is
evil
in
the
best
there
is
i
would
fain
hope
but
here
his
face
grew
grave
and
sad
good
in
the
worst
but
even
allowing
that
we
could
draw
the
line
is
it
likely
that
the
bad
even
those
who
have
all
but
lost
the
last
spark
who
do
want
to
be
good
is
it
likely
that
they
if
as
we
must
believe
under
divine
control
would
be
allowed
to
leave
their
new
life
of
punishment
punishment
in
the
sense
of
mind
you
to
come
back
here
wasting
their
time
one
may
say
to
frighten
perfectly
innocent
people
for
no
purpose
no
i
think
i
am
quite
consistent
only
try
to
get
rid
of
all
that
is
what
we
can
all
do
but
really
i
should
apologise
for
all
this
lecture
and
he
was
turning
to
me
with
a
smile
when
his
eyes
fell
on
the
cup
which
he
had
replaced
on
the
table
i
can
not
get
over
the
impression
that
i
have
seen
that
cup
no
not
that
cup
but
one
just
like
it
before
not
long
ago
i
fancy
he
said
oh
you
must
let
us
know
if
you
find
out
anything
we
all
exclaimed
i
certainly
shall
do
so
he
said
and
a
few
minutes
afterwards
he
and
grenfell
took
their
leave
but
i
had
time
for
a
word
or
two
with
the
latter
out
of
hearing
of
the
others
who
is
sir
robert
masters
i
asked
have
you
known
him
long
he
is
a
very
uncommon
and
impressive
sort
of
man
yes
i
thought
you
would
like
him
i
have
not
personally
known
him
long
but
he
is
an
old
friend
of
friends
of
ours
he
is
of
good
family
an
old
baronetcy
but
he
is
not
much
known
in
fashionable
society
he
travels
a
great
deal
or
has
done
so
rather
and
people
say
he
has
ideas
though
that
would
not
go
against
him
in
the
world
peculiar
ideas
or
the
cant
of
them
are
rather
the
fashion
it
seems
to
me
but
there
is
no
cant
about
him
and
whatever
his
ideas
are
went
on
young
grenfell
warmly
he
is
one
of
the
men
i
ever
knew
he
has
settled
down
for
some
years
and
devotes
his
whole
life
to
doing
good
but
so
quietly
and
unostentatiously
that
no
one
knows
how
much
he
does
and
others
get
the
credit
of
it
very
often
that
was
all
i
heard
i
have
never
seen
sir
robert
again
still
i
have
by
no
means
arrived
yet
at
the
end
of
my
ghost
story
the
cup
and
saucer
were
carefully
washed
and
replaced
in
the
cabinet
the
summer
gradually
waned
and
we
all
returned
to
our
own
home
it
was
at
a
considerable
distance
from
my
sister
and
we
met
each
other
principally
in
the
summer
time
so
though
i
did
not
forget
sir
robert
masters
or
his
somewhat
strange
conversation
amid
the
crowd
of
daily
interests
and
pleasures
duties
and
cares
none
of
the
incidents
i
have
here
recorded
were
much
in
my
mind
and
but
that
i
had
while
still
in
germany
carefully
noted
the
details
of
all
bearing
directly
or
indirectly
on
nora
ghost
as
we
had
come
to
call
it
though
it
was
but
rarely
alluded
to
before
the
child
herself
i
should
not
now
have
been
able
to
give
them
with
circumstantiality
fully
fifteen
months
after
the
visit
to
my
sister
during
which
we
had
met
sir
robert
the
whole
was
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
recalled
to
my
memory
mark
and
nora
the
elder
my
sister
that
is
were
in
their
turn
staying
with
us
when
one
morning
at
breakfast
the
post
brought
for
the
latter
an
unusually
bulky
and
letter
she
opened
it
glanced
at
an
outer
sheet
enclosing
several
pages
in
a
different
handwriting
and
passed
it
on
to
me
we
must
read
the
rest
together
she
said
in
a
low
voice
glancing
at
the
children
who
were
at
the
table
how
interesting
it
will
be
the
sheet
she
had
handed
to
me
was
a
short
note
from
grenfell
it
was
dated
from
some
place
in
norway
where
he
was
fishing
and
from
whence
he
had
addressed
the
whole
packet
to
my
sister
own
home
not
knowing
of
her
absence
my
dear
daventry
it
began
the
enclosed
will
have
been
a
long
time
of
reaching
its
real
destination
for
it
is
as
you
will
see
really
intended
for
your
sister
no
doubt
it
will
interest
you
too
as
it
has
done
me
though
i
am
too
and
prosaic
to
enter
into
such
things
much
still
it
is
curious
please
keep
the
letter
i
am
sure
my
friend
intends
you
to
do
so
yours
very
truly
ralph
grenfell
the
manuscript
enclosed
was
of
course
from
sir
robert
himself
it
was
in
the
form
of
a
letter
to
young
grenfell
and
after
explaining
that
he
thought
it
better
to
write
to
him
not
having
my
address
he
plunged
into
the
real
object
of
his
communication
you
will
not
he
said
have
forgotten
the
incident
of
the
in
the
summer
of
last
year
and
the
curious
story
your
friend
was
so
good
as
to
tell
us
about
it
you
may
remember
will
i
am
sure
do
so
my
strong
impression
that
i
had
recently
seen
one
like
it
after
i
left
you
i
could
not
get
this
feeling
out
of
my
head
it
is
always
irritating
not
to
be
able
figuratively
speaking
lay
your
hand
on
a
recollection
and
in
this
instance
i
really
wanted
to
get
the
clue
as
it
might
lead
to
some
sort
of
of
the
little
girl
strange
experience
i
cudgelled
my
brains
but
all
to
no
purpose
i
went
over
in
memory
all
the
houses
at
which
i
had
visited
within
a
certain
space
of
time
i
made
lists
of
all
the
people
i
knew
interested
in
ancient
or
modern
and
likely
to
possess
specimens
of
it
but
all
in
vain
all
i
got
for
my
pains
was
that
people
began
to
think
i
was
developing
a
new
crotchet
or
as
i
heard
one
lady
say
to
another
not
knowing
i
was
within
earshot
poor
man
must
be
a
little
off
his
head
though
till
now
i
have
always
denied
it
but
the
revulsion
from
benevolent
schemes
to
shows
it
only
too
plainly
so
i
thought
i
had
better
leave
off
my
friends
about
porcelain
and
faïence
german
ware
in
particular
and
after
a
while
i
thought
no
more
about
it
two
months
ago
i
had
occasion
to
make
a
journey
to
the
north
the
same
journey
and
to
stay
at
the
same
house
where
i
have
been
four
or
five
times
since
i
saw
the
but
this
was
what
happened
time
there
is
a
junction
by
which
one
must
pass
on
this
journey
i
generally
manage
to
suit
my
trains
so
as
to
avoid
waiting
there
but
this
is
not
always
feasible
this
time
i
found
that
an
hour
at
the
junction
was
inevitable
there
is
a
very
good
refreshment
room
there
kept
by
very
civil
decent
people
they
knew
me
by
sight
and
after
i
had
had
a
cup
of
tea
they
proposed
to
me
as
they
have
done
before
to
wait
in
their
little
parlour
just
off
the
public
room
would
be
quieter
and
more
comfortable
said
either
the
mother
or
the
daughter
who
manage
the
concern
i
thanked
them
and
settled
myself
in
an
with
my
book
when
looking
up
there
on
the
mantelpiece
stood
the
fellow
cup
the
identical
shape
pattern
and
colour
it
all
flashed
into
my
mind
then
i
had
made
this
journey
just
before
going
into
your
neighbourhood
last
year
and
had
waited
in
this
little
parlour
just
as
this
time
did
you
get
that
cup
mrs
smith
i
asked
there
were
two
or
three
rather
pretty
bits
of
china
about
the
good
woman
was
pleased
at
my
noticing
it
sir
is
it
pretty
i
rather
a
fancy
for
china
that
cup
was
sent
me
by
my
niece
she
said
she
picked
it
up
somewhere
at
a
sale
i
think
it
foreign
sir
is
it
german
but
ca
you
find
out
your
niece
got
it
for
at
the
word
my
hopes
fell
can
ask
her
i
shall
be
writing
to
her
this
week
she
replied
and
she
promised
to
get
any
information
she
could
for
me
within
a
fortnight
by
which
time
i
expected
to
pass
that
way
again
i
did
so
and
smith
proved
as
good
as
her
word
the
niece
had
got
the
cup
from
a
friend
of
hers
an
auctioneer
and
he
not
she
had
got
it
at
a
sale
but
he
was
away
from
home
she
could
hear
nothing
more
at
present
she
gave
his
address
however
and
assurances
that
he
was
very
and
would
gladly
put
the
gentleman
in
the
way
of
getting
china
like
it
if
it
was
to
be
got
he
would
be
home
by
the
middle
of
the
month
it
was
now
the
middle
of
the
month
the
auctioneer
town
was
not
above
a
couple
of
hours
off
my
line
perhaps
you
will
all
laugh
at
me
when
i
tell
you
that
i
went
those
two
hours
out
of
my
way
arriving
at
the
town
late
that
night
and
putting
up
at
a
queer
old
inn
worth
going
to
see
for
itself
on
purpose
to
find
the
man
of
the
hammer
i
found
him
he
was
very
civil
though
rather
mystified
he
remembered
the
cup
perfectly
but
there
was
no
chance
of
getting
any
like
it
where
it
came
from
where
was
that
i
asked
eagerly
a
sale
some
miles
from
here
about
four
years
ago
he
replied
was
the
sale
of
the
furniture
and
plate
and
everything
in
fact
of
a
widow
lady
she
had
some
pretty
china
for
she
had
a
fancy
for
it
that
cup
was
not
of
much
value
it
was
quite
modern
i
bought
it
in
for
a
trifle
i
gave
it
to
miss
cross
and
she
sent
it
to
her
aunt
as
you
know
as
for
getting
any
like
it
but
i
interrupted
him
by
assuring
him
i
did
not
wish
that
but
that
i
had
reasons
for
wanting
some
information
about
the
person
who
i
believed
had
bought
the
cup
to
do
any
harm
to
any
one
i
said
matter
of
feeling
a
similar
cup
had
been
bought
by
a
person
i
was
interested
in
and
i
feared
that
person
was
dead
the
auctioneer
face
cleared
he
fancied
he
began
to
understand
me
am
afraid
you
are
right
sir
if
the
person
you
mean
was
young
paulet
the
lady
son
you
may
have
met
him
on
his
travels
his
death
was
very
sad
i
believe
it
killed
his
mother
they
say
she
never
looked
up
after
and
as
she
had
no
near
relative
to
follow
her
everything
was
sold
i
remember
i
was
told
all
that
at
the
sale
and
it
seemed
to
me
particularly
sad
even
though
one
comes
across
many
sad
things
in
our
line
of
business
you
remember
the
particulars
of
paulet
death
i
asked
that
it
happened
suddenly
somewhere
in
foreign
parts
i
did
not
know
the
family
till
i
was
asked
to
take
charge
of
the
sale
he
replied
you
possibly
get
any
details
for
me
i
feel
sure
it
is
the
same
paulet
i
said
boldly
the
auctioneer
considered
i
can
i
rather
think
a
former
servant
of
theirs
is
still
in
the
neighbourhood
he
replied
i
thanked
him
and
left
him
my
address
to
which
he
promised
to
write
i
felt
it
was
perhaps
better
not
to
pursue
my
inquiries
further
in
person
it
might
lead
to
annoyance
or
possibly
to
gossip
about
the
dead
which
i
detest
i
jotted
down
some
particulars
for
the
auctioneer
guidance
and
went
on
my
way
that
was
a
fortnight
ago
i
have
his
answer
which
i
transcribe
the
servant
i
spoke
of
could
not
tell
me
very
much
as
she
was
not
long
in
the
late
paulet
service
to
hear
more
she
says
you
must
apply
to
the
relations
of
the
family
young
paulet
was
tall
and
fair
and
very
his
mother
and
he
were
deeply
attached
to
each
other
he
travelled
a
good
deal
and
used
to
bring
her
home
lots
of
pretty
things
he
met
his
death
in
some
part
of
germany
where
there
are
forests
for
though
it
was
thought
at
first
he
had
died
of
heart
disease
the
doctors
proved
he
had
been
struck
by
lightning
and
his
body
was
found
in
the
forest
and
the
papers
on
him
showed
who
he
was
the
body
was
sent
home
to
be
buried
and
all
that
was
found
with
it
a
knapsack
and
its
contents
among
which
was
the
cup
i
bought
at
the
sale
his
death
was
about
the
middle
of
august
i
shall
be
glad
if
this
information
is
of
any
service
this
continued
sir
robert
own
letter
is
all
i
have
been
able
to
learn
there
does
not
seem
to
have
been
the
very
slightest
suspicion
of
foul
play
nor
do
i
think
it
the
least
likely
there
was
any
ground
for
such
young
paulet
probably
died
some
way
farther
in
the
forest
than
silberbach
and
it
is
even
possible
the
surly
landlord
never
heard
of
it
it
be
worth
while
to
inquire
about
it
should
your
friends
ever
be
there
again
if
i
should
be
in
the
neighbourhood
i
certainly
should
do
so
the
whole
coincidences
are
very
striking
then
followed
apologies
for
the
length
of
his
letter
which
he
had
been
betrayed
into
by
his
anxiety
to
tell
all
there
was
to
tell
in
return
he
asked
grenfell
to
obtain
from
me
certain
dates
and
particulars
as
he
wished
to
note
them
down
it
was
the
of
august
on
which
ghost
had
appeared
just
two
years
after
the
august
of
the
poor
young
man
death
there
was
also
a
postscript
to
sir
robert
letter
in
which
he
said
i
think
in
place
i
would
say
nothing
to
the
little
girl
of
what
we
have
discovered
and
i
have
never
done
so
this
is
all
i
have
to
tell
i
offer
no
suggestions
no
theories
in
explanation
of
the
facts
those
who
like
sir
robert
masters
are
able
and
desirous
to
treat
such
subjects
scientifically
or
philosophically
will
doubtless
form
their
own
i
can
not
say
that
i
find
theory
a
perfectly
satisfactory
one
perhaps
i
do
not
sufficiently
understand
it
but
i
have
tried
to
give
it
in
his
own
words
should
this
relation
of
a
curious
experience
meet
his
eyes
i
am
sure
he
will
forgive
my
having
brought
him
into
it
besides
it
is
not
likely
that
he
would
be
recognised
men
and
women
too
of
peculiar
ideas
sincere
investigators
and
honest
searchers
after
truth
as
well
as
their
superficial
plagiarists
being
by
no
means
rare
in
these
days
iv
the
story
of
the
rippling
train
let
tell
ghost
stories
then
said
gladys
are
you
tired
of
them
one
hears
nothing
else
nowadays
and
all
really
vouched
for
only
you
never
see
the
person
who
saw
or
heard
or
felt
the
ghost
it
is
always
somebody
sister
or
cousin
or
friend
friend
objected
young
snowdon
another
of
the
guests
at
the
quarries
i
do
know
that
that
is
quite
a
reasonable
ground
for
discrediting
them
said
her
husband
it
is
natural
enough
indeed
inevitable
that
the
principal
or
principals
in
such
cases
should
be
much
more
rarely
come
across
than
the
stories
themselves
a
hundred
people
can
repeat
the
story
but
the
author
or
rather
hero
of
it
ca
be
in
a
hundred
places
at
once
you
do
disbelieve
in
any
other
statement
or
narrative
merely
because
you
have
never
seen
the
prime
mover
in
it
but
i
did
say
i
discredited
them
on
that
account
said
snowdon
you
take
one
up
so
archie
i
not
logical
and
reasonable
i
do
pretend
to
be
if
i
meant
anything
it
was
that
a
ghost
story
would
have
a
great
pull
over
other
ghost
stories
if
one
could
see
the
person
it
happened
to
one
does
get
rather
provoked
at
coming
across
him
or
her
she
added
a
little
petulantly
she
was
tired
they
were
all
rather
tired
for
it
was
the
first
evening
since
the
party
had
assembled
at
the
large
country
house
known
as
the
quarries
on
which
there
was
not
to
be
dancing
with
the
additional
fatigue
of
ten
miles
there
and
ten
back
again
and
three
or
four
evenings
of
such
doings
without
intermission
tell
even
on
the
young
and
vigorous
various
less
energetic
ways
of
passing
the
evening
had
been
proposed
music
games
reading
aloud
recitation
none
had
found
favour
in
everybody
sight
and
now
gladys
lloyd
proposal
that
they
should
tell
ghost
stories
seemed
likely
to
fall
flat
also
for
a
moment
or
two
no
one
answered
snowdon
last
remarks
then
somewhat
to
everybody
surprise
the
young
daughter
of
the
house
turned
to
her
mother
mamma
she
said
do
be
vexed
with
me
i
know
you
warned
me
once
to
be
careful
how
i
spoke
of
it
but
it
be
nice
if
uncle
paul
would
tell
us
his
ghost
story
and
then
snowdon
she
went
on
you
could
always
say
you
had
heard
ghost
story
at
or
from
which
should
i
say
headquarters
lady
denholme
glanced
round
half
nervously
before
she
replied
locally
speaking
it
would
not
be
headquarters
nina
she
said
the
quarries
was
not
the
scene
of
your
uncle
ghost
story
but
i
almost
think
it
is
better
not
to
speak
about
it
i
am
not
sure
that
he
would
like
it
mentioned
and
he
will
be
coming
in
a
moment
he
had
only
a
note
to
write
i
do
wish
he
would
tell
it
to
us
said
nina
regretfully
do
you
think
mamma
i
might
just
run
to
the
study
and
ask
him
and
if
he
did
not
like
the
idea
he
might
say
so
to
me
and
no
one
would
seem
to
know
anything
about
it
uncle
paul
is
so
kind
i
never
afraid
of
asking
him
any
favour
thank
you
nina
for
your
good
opinion
of
me
you
see
there
is
no
rule
without
exceptions
listeners
do
sometimes
hear
pleasant
things
of
themselves
said
marischal
as
he
at
that
moment
came
round
the
screen
which
half
concealed
the
doorway
what
is
the
special
favour
you
were
thinking
of
asking
me
nina
looked
rather
taken
aback
how
softly
you
opened
the
door
uncle
paul
she
said
i
would
not
have
spoken
of
you
if
i
had
known
you
were
there
but
after
all
you
were
saying
no
harm
observed
her
brother
michael
and
for
my
part
i
do
believe
uncle
paul
would
mind
our
asking
him
what
we
were
speaking
of
what
was
it
asked
marischal
i
think
as
i
have
heard
so
much
you
may
as
well
tell
me
the
whole
it
was
only
began
nina
but
her
mother
interrupted
her
i
have
told
nina
not
to
speak
of
it
paul
she
said
anxiously
but
it
was
only
that
all
these
young
people
are
talking
about
ghost
stories
and
they
want
you
to
tell
them
your
own
strange
experience
you
must
not
be
vexed
with
them
vexed
said
marischal
not
in
the
least
but
for
a
moment
or
two
he
said
no
more
and
even
pretty
spoilt
snowdon
looked
a
little
uneasy
you
should
have
persisted
nina
she
whispered
marischal
must
have
had
unusually
quick
ears
he
looked
up
and
smiled
i
really
do
mind
telling
you
all
there
is
to
hear
he
said
at
one
time
i
had
a
sort
of
dislike
to
mentioning
the
story
for
the
sake
of
others
the
details
would
have
led
to
its
being
recognised
and
it
might
have
been
painful
but
there
is
no
one
now
living
to
whom
it
would
matter
you
know
he
added
turning
to
his
sister
her
husband
is
dead
too
lady
denholme
shook
her
head
no
she
said
i
did
not
hear
yes
said
her
brother
i
saw
his
death
in
the
papers
last
year
he
had
married
again
i
believe
there
is
not
now
therefore
any
reason
why
i
should
not
tell
the
story
if
it
will
interest
you
he
went
on
turning
to
the
others
and
there
is
not
very
much
to
tell
not
worth
making
such
a
preamble
about
it
was
let
me
see
yes
it
must
be
nearly
fifteen
years
ago
wait
a
moment
uncle
paul
said
nina
yes
that
all
right
gladys
you
and
i
will
hold
each
other
hands
and
pinch
hard
if
we
get
very
frightened
thank
you
miss
lloyd
replied
on
the
whole
i
should
prefer
for
you
not
to
hold
my
hand
but
i
wo
pinch
you
so
as
to
hurt
said
nina
reassuringly
and
it
is
as
if
we
were
in
the
dark
shall
i
turn
down
the
lamps
asked
snowdon
no
no
exclaimed
his
wife
there
really
is
nothing
frightening
scarcely
even
in
my
story
at
all
said
marischal
half
apologetically
you
make
me
feel
like
an
impostor
oh
no
uncle
paul
do
say
that
it
is
all
my
fault
for
interrupting
said
nina
now
go
on
please
i
have
gladys
hand
all
the
same
she
added
it
just
as
well
to
be
prepared
well
then
began
marischal
once
more
it
must
be
nearly
fifteen
years
ago
and
i
had
not
seen
her
for
fully
ten
years
before
that
again
i
was
not
thinking
of
her
in
the
least
in
a
sense
i
had
really
forgotten
her
she
had
quite
gone
out
of
my
life
that
has
always
struck
me
as
a
very
curious
point
in
the
story
he
added
parenthetically
wo
you
tell
us
who
was
uncle
paul
asked
nina
half
shyly
oh
yes
i
was
going
to
do
so
i
am
not
skilled
in
you
see
she
was
at
the
time
i
first
knew
her
at
the
only
time
indeed
that
i
knew
her
a
very
sweet
and
attractive
girl
named
maud
bertram
she
was
very
pretty
more
than
pretty
for
she
had
remarkably
regular
features
her
profile
was
always
admired
and
a
tall
and
graceful
figure
and
she
was
a
bright
and
happy
creature
too
that
perhaps
was
almost
her
greatest
charm
you
will
wonder
i
see
the
question
hovering
on
your
lips
miss
lloyd
and
on
yours
too
snowdon
why
if
i
admired
her
and
liked
her
so
much
i
did
not
go
further
and
i
will
tell
you
frankly
that
i
did
not
because
i
dared
not
i
had
then
no
prospect
of
being
able
to
marry
for
years
to
come
and
i
was
not
very
young
i
was
already
nearly
thirty
and
maud
was
quite
ten
years
younger
i
was
wise
enough
and
old
enough
to
realise
the
situation
thoroughly
and
to
be
on
my
guard
and
maud
asked
snowdon
she
was
surrounded
by
admirers
it
seemed
to
me
then
that
it
would
have
been
insufferable
conceit
to
have
even
asked
myself
if
it
could
matter
to
her
it
was
only
in
the
light
of
after
events
that
the
possibility
of
my
having
been
mistaken
occurred
to
me
and
i
do
even
now
see
that
i
could
have
acted
otherwise
here
uncle
paul
sighed
a
little
we
were
the
best
of
friends
she
knew
that
i
admired
her
and
she
seemed
to
take
a
frank
pleasure
in
its
being
so
i
had
always
hoped
that
she
really
liked
and
trusted
me
as
a
friend
but
no
more
the
last
time
i
saw
her
was
just
before
i
started
for
portugal
where
i
remained
three
years
when
i
returned
to
london
maud
had
been
married
for
two
years
and
had
gone
straight
out
to
india
on
her
marriage
and
except
by
some
few
friends
who
had
known
us
both
intimately
i
seldom
heard
her
mentioned
and
time
passed
i
can
not
say
i
had
exactly
forgotten
her
but
she
was
not
much
or
often
in
my
thoughts
i
was
a
busy
and
man
and
life
had
proved
a
serious
matter
to
me
now
and
then
some
passing
resemblance
would
recall
her
to
my
mind
once
especially
when
i
had
been
asked
to
look
in
to
see
the
young
wife
of
one
of
my
cousins
in
her
something
in
her
figure
and
bearing
brought
back
maud
to
my
memory
for
it
was
thus
in
full
dress
that
i
had
last
seen
her
and
thus
perhaps
unconsciously
her
image
had
remained
photographed
on
my
brain
but
as
far
as
i
can
recollect
at
the
time
when
the
occurrence
i
am
going
to
relate
to
you
happened
i
had
not
been
thinking
of
maud
bertram
for
months
i
was
in
london
just
then
staying
with
my
brother
my
eldest
brother
who
had
been
married
for
several
years
and
lived
in
our
own
old
in
square
it
was
in
april
a
clear
spring
day
with
no
fog
or
about
and
it
was
not
yet
four
in
the
afternoon
not
very
circumstances
you
will
admit
i
had
come
home
early
from
my
club
it
was
a
sort
of
with
me
just
then
for
a
few
weeks
intending
to
get
some
letters
written
which
had
been
on
my
mind
for
some
days
and
i
had
sauntered
into
the
library
a
pleasant
room
lined
with
books
on
the
before
setting
to
work
i
sat
down
for
a
moment
or
two
in
an
by
the
fire
for
it
was
still
cool
enough
weather
to
make
a
fire
desirable
and
began
thinking
over
my
letters
no
thought
no
shadow
of
a
thought
of
my
old
friend
miss
bertram
was
present
with
me
of
that
i
am
perfectly
certain
the
door
was
on
the
same
side
of
the
room
as
the
fireplace
as
i
sat
there
half
facing
the
fire
i
also
half
faced
the
door
i
had
not
shut
it
properly
on
coming
in
i
had
only
closed
it
without
turning
the
handle
and
i
did
not
feel
surprised
when
it
slowly
and
noiselessly
swung
open
till
it
stood
right
out
into
the
room
concealing
the
actual
doorway
from
my
view
you
will
perhaps
understand
the
position
better
if
you
think
of
the
door
as
just
then
acting
like
a
screen
to
the
doorway
from
where
i
sat
i
could
not
have
seen
any
one
entering
the
room
till
he
or
she
had
got
beyond
the
door
itself
i
glanced
up
half
expecting
to
see
some
one
come
in
but
there
was
no
one
the
door
had
swung
open
of
itself
for
the
moment
i
sat
on
with
only
the
vague
thought
passing
through
my
mind
must
shut
it
before
i
begin
to
write
but
suddenly
i
found
my
eyes
fixing
themselves
on
the
carpet
something
had
come
within
their
range
of
vision
compelling
their
attention
in
a
mechanical
sort
of
way
what
was
it
was
my
first
idea
there
be
anything
on
fire
but
i
dismissed
the
notion
almost
as
soon
as
it
suggested
itself
the
something
faint
and
shadowy
that
came
slowly
rippling
itself
in
as
it
were
beyond
the
dark
wood
of
the
open
door
was
yet
too
material
for
my
next
idea
was
a
curious
one
looks
like
soapy
water
i
said
to
myself
one
of
the
housemaids
have
been
scrubbing
and
upset
a
pail
on
the
stairs
for
the
stair
to
the
next
floor
almost
faced
the
library
door
but
no
i
rubbed
my
eyes
and
looked
again
the
soapy
water
theory
gave
way
the
wavy
something
that
kept
gliding
rippling
in
gradually
assumed
a
more
substantial
appearance
it
was
yes
i
suddenly
became
convinced
of
it
it
was
ripples
of
soft
silken
stuff
creeping
in
as
if
in
some
mysterious
way
unfolded
or
unrolled
not
jerkily
or
irregularly
but
glidingly
and
smoothly
like
little
wavelets
on
the
and
i
sat
there
and
gazed
did
you
not
jump
up
and
look
behind
the
door
to
see
what
it
was
you
may
reasonably
ask
that
question
i
can
not
answer
why
i
sat
still
as
if
bewitched
or
under
some
irresistible
influence
i
can
not
tell
but
so
it
was
and
it
came
always
rippling
in
till
at
last
it
began
to
rise
as
it
still
came
on
and
i
saw
that
a
figure
a
tall
graceful
figure
was
slowly
advancing
backwards
of
course
into
the
room
and
that
the
waves
of
pale
silk
a
very
delicate
shade
of
pearly
gray
i
think
it
must
have
been
were
in
fact
the
lower
portion
of
a
long
the
upper
part
of
which
hung
in
deep
folds
from
the
waist
she
moved
in
i
can
not
describe
the
motion
it
was
not
like
ordinary
walking
or
stepping
backwards
till
the
whole
of
her
figure
and
the
clear
profile
of
her
face
and
head
were
distinctly
visible
and
when
at
last
she
stopped
and
stood
there
full
in
my
view
just
but
only
just
beyond
the
door
i
saw
it
came
upon
me
like
a
flash
that
she
was
no
stranger
to
me
this
mysterious
visitant
i
recognised
unchanged
it
seemed
to
me
since
the
day
ten
years
ago
when
i
had
last
seen
her
the
beautiful
features
of
maud
bertram
marischal
stopped
a
moment
nobody
spoke
then
he
went
on
again
i
should
not
have
said
there
was
one
great
change
in
the
sweet
face
you
remember
my
telling
you
that
one
of
my
greatest
charms
was
her
bright
sunny
happiness
she
never
seemed
gloomy
or
depressed
or
dissatisfied
seldom
even
pensive
but
in
this
respect
the
face
i
sat
there
gazing
at
was
utterly
unlike
maud
bertram
its
expression
as
she
or
stood
there
looking
not
towards
me
but
out
beyond
as
if
at
some
one
or
something
outside
the
doorway
was
of
the
profoundest
sadness
anything
sad
i
had
never
seen
in
a
human
face
and
i
trust
i
never
may
but
i
sat
on
as
motionless
almost
as
she
gazing
at
her
fixedly
with
no
desire
no
power
perhaps
to
move
or
approach
more
nearly
to
the
phantom
i
was
not
in
the
least
frightened
i
knew
it
a
phantom
but
i
felt
paralysed
and
as
if
i
myself
had
somehow
got
outside
of
ordinary
conditions
and
there
i
sat
staring
at
maud
and
there
she
stood
gazing
before
her
with
that
terrible
unspeakable
sadness
in
her
face
which
even
though
i
felt
no
seemed
to
freeze
me
with
a
kind
of
unutterable
pity
i
do
know
how
long
i
had
sat
thus
or
how
long
i
might
have
continued
to
sit
there
almost
as
if
in
a
trance
when
suddenly
i
heard
the
bell
ring
it
seemed
to
awaken
me
i
started
up
and
glanced
round
that
i
should
find
the
vision
dispelled
but
no
she
was
still
there
and
i
sank
back
into
my
seat
just
as
i
heard
my
brother
coming
quickly
upstairs
he
came
towards
the
library
and
seeing
the
door
wide
open
walked
in
and
i
still
gazing
saw
his
figure
through
that
of
the
woman
in
the
as
you
may
walk
through
a
wreath
of
mist
or
smoke
only
do
misunderstand
me
the
figure
of
maud
till
that
moment
had
had
nothing
unsubstantial
about
it
she
had
looked
to
me
as
she
stood
there
literally
and
exactly
like
a
living
woman
the
shade
of
her
dress
the
colour
of
her
hair
the
few
ornaments
she
wore
all
were
as
defined
and
clear
as
yours
nina
at
the
present
moment
and
remained
so
or
perhaps
became
so
again
as
soon
as
my
brother
was
well
within
the
room
he
came
forward
addressing
me
by
name
but
i
answered
him
in
a
whisper
begging
him
to
be
silent
and
to
sit
down
on
the
seat
opposite
me
for
a
moment
or
two
he
did
so
though
he
was
taken
aback
by
my
strange
manner
for
i
still
kept
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
i
had
a
queer
consciousness
that
if
i
looked
away
would
fade
and
i
wanted
to
keep
cool
and
see
what
would
happen
i
asked
herbert
in
a
low
voice
if
saw
nothing
but
though
he
mechanically
followed
the
direction
of
my
eyes
he
shook
his
head
in
bewilderment
and
for
a
moment
or
two
he
remained
thus
then
i
began
to
notice
that
the
figure
was
growing
less
clear
as
if
it
were
receding
yet
without
growing
smaller
to
the
sight
it
grew
fainter
and
vaguer
the
colours
grew
hazy
i
rubbed
my
eyes
once
or
twice
with
a
half
idea
that
my
long
watching
was
making
them
misty
but
it
was
not
so
my
eyes
were
not
at
fault
slowly
but
surely
maud
bertram
or
her
ghost
melted
away
till
all
trace
of
her
had
gone
i
saw
again
the
familiar
pattern
of
the
carpet
where
she
had
stood
and
the
objects
of
the
room
that
had
been
hidden
by
her
draperies
all
again
in
the
most
commonplace
way
but
she
was
gone
quite
gone
then
herbert
seeing
me
relax
my
intense
gaze
began
to
question
me
i
told
him
exactly
what
i
have
told
you
he
answered
as
every
person
of
course
would
that
it
was
strange
but
that
such
things
did
happen
sometimes
and
were
classed
by
the
wise
under
the
head
of
delusions
i
was
not
well
perhaps
he
suggested
been
had
i
not
better
see
a
doctor
but
i
shook
my
head
i
was
quite
well
and
i
said
so
and
perhaps
he
was
right
it
might
be
an
optical
delusion
only
i
had
never
had
any
experience
of
such
things
the
same
i
said
shall
mark
down
the
date
herbert
laughed
and
said
that
was
what
people
always
did
in
such
cases
if
he
knew
where
then
was
he
would
write
to
her
just
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
and
ask
her
to
be
so
good
as
to
look
up
her
diary
if
she
kept
one
and
let
us
know
what
she
had
been
doing
on
that
particular
day
of
april
is
it
he
said
when
i
would
have
it
her
wraith
had
paid
me
a
visit
i
let
him
talk
it
seemed
to
remove
the
strange
painful
impression
painful
because
of
that
terrible
sadness
in
the
sweet
face
but
we
neither
of
us
knew
where
she
was
we
scarcely
remembered
her
married
name
and
so
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
except
what
i
did
at
once
in
spite
of
herbert
rallying
to
mark
down
the
day
and
hour
with
scrupulous
exactness
in
diary
time
passed
i
had
not
forgotten
my
strange
experience
but
of
course
the
impression
of
it
lessened
by
degrees
till
it
seemed
more
like
a
curious
dream
than
anything
more
real
when
one
day
i
hear
of
poor
maud
again
maud
i
can
not
help
calling
her
i
heard
of
her
indirectly
and
probably
but
for
the
sadness
of
her
story
i
should
never
have
heard
it
at
all
it
was
a
friend
of
her
husband
family
who
had
mentioned
the
circumstances
in
the
hearing
of
a
friend
of
mine
and
one
day
something
brought
round
the
conversation
to
old
times
and
he
startled
me
by
suddenly
inquiring
if
i
remembered
maud
bertram
i
said
of
course
i
did
did
he
know
anything
of
her
and
then
he
told
me
she
was
dead
she
had
died
some
months
ago
after
a
long
and
trying
illness
the
result
of
a
terrible
accident
she
had
caught
fire
one
evening
when
dressed
for
some
grand
entertainment
or
other
and
though
her
injuries
did
not
seem
likely
to
be
fatal
at
the
time
she
had
never
recovered
the
shock
was
so
pretty
my
friend
said
one
of
the
saddest
parts
of
it
was
that
i
hear
she
was
terrifically
disfigured
and
she
took
this
most
sadly
to
heart
the
right
side
of
her
face
was
utterly
ruined
and
the
sight
of
the
right
eye
lost
though
strange
to
say
the
left
side
entirely
escaped
and
seeing
her
in
profile
one
would
have
had
no
notion
of
what
had
happened
was
it
not
sad
she
was
such
a
sweet
bright
creature
i
did
not
tell
him
story
for
i
did
not
want
it
chattered
about
but
a
strange
sort
of
shiver
ran
through
me
at
his
words
was
the
left
side
of
her
face
that
the
wraith
of
my
poor
friend
had
allowed
me
to
see
oh
uncle
paul
exclaimed
nina
and
as
to
the
dates
inquired
snowdon
i
never
knew
the
exact
date
of
the
accident
said
marischal
but
that
of
her
death
was
fully
six
months
after
i
had
seen
her
and
in
my
own
mind
i
have
never
made
any
doubt
that
it
was
at
or
about
probably
a
short
time
after
the
accident
that
she
came
to
me
it
seemed
a
kind
of
appeal
for
sympathy
and
a
farewell
also
poor
child
they
all
sat
silent
for
some
little
time
and
then
marischal
got
up
and
went
off
to
his
own
quarters
saying
something
vaguely
about
seeing
if
his
letters
had
gone
what
a
touching
story
said
gladys
lloyd
i
am
afraid
after
all
it
has
been
more
painful
than
he
realised
for
marischal
to
tell
it
did
you
know
anything
of
maud
husband
dear
lady
denholme
was
he
kind
to
her
was
she
happy
we
never
heard
much
about
her
married
life
her
hostess
replied
but
i
have
no
reason
to
think
she
was
unhappy
her
husband
married
again
two
or
three
years
after
her
death
but
that
says
nothing
n
no
said
nina
all
the
same
mamma
i
am
sure
she
really
did
love
uncle
paul
very
much
much
more
than
he
had
any
idea
of
poor
maud
and
he
has
never
married
added
gladys
no
said
lady
denholme
but
there
have
been
many
practical
difficulties
in
the
way
of
his
doing
so
he
has
had
a
most
absorbingly
busy
life
and
now
that
he
is
more
at
leisure
he
feels
himself
too
old
to
form
new
ties
but
persisted
nina
if
he
had
had
any
idea
at
the
time
that
maud
cared
for
him
so
ah
well
lady
denholme
allowed
in
that
case
in
spite
of
the
practical
difficulties
things
would
probably
have
been
different
and
again
nina
repeated
softly
poor
maud
clark
transcriber
note
in
a
very
few
cases
missing
punctuation
has
been
added
one
change
was
made
to
the
text
towards
the
end
of
part
of
the
third
tale
unexplained
the
word
went
was
replaced
by
gone
in
the
sentence
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
should
not
have
gone
out
of
my
mind
in
such
a
case
