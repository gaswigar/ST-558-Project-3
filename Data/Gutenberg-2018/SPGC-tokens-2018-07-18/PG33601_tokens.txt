the
fire
blazed
newly
from
its
embers
and
set
strange
shadows
to
dancing
upon
the
polished
floor
now
and
then
there
was
a
gleam
from
some
dark
mahogany
surface
and
an
answering
flash
from
a
bit
of
old
silver
in
the
cabinet
april
warm
with
may
promise
came
in
through
the
open
window
laden
with
the
wholesome
fragrance
of
growing
things
and
yet
because
an
old
lady
loved
it
there
was
a
fire
upon
the
hearth
and
no
other
light
in
the
room
she
sat
in
her
easy
chair
sheltered
from
possible
draughts
and
watched
it
seemingly
unmindful
of
her
three
companions
tints
of
amethyst
and
sapphire
appeared
in
the
haze
from
the
backlog
and
were
lost
a
moment
later
in
the
dominant
flame
in
that
last
hour
of
glorious
life
the
tree
was
giving
back
its
memories
blue
skies
grey
days
just
tinged
with
gold
lost
rainbows
and
flashes
of
sun
friendly
ghosts
of
times
far
past
were
conjured
back
in
shadows
outspread
wings
clouds
and
long
nights
that
ended
in
dawn
swift
flights
of
birds
and
wandering
craft
of
thistledown
were
mirrored
for
an
instant
upon
the
shining
floor
and
then
forgotten
because
of
falling
leaves
lines
of
transfiguring
light
changed
the
snowy
softness
of
miss
hair
to
silver
and
gave
to
her
hands
the
delicacy
of
carved
ivory
a
tiny
foot
peeped
out
from
beneath
her
gown
clad
in
its
embroidered
silk
stocking
and
slipper
so
brave
in
its
trappings
of
silver
buckles
that
she
might
have
been
eighteen
instead
of
upon
her
face
the
light
lay
longest
perhaps
with
an
answering
love
the
years
had
been
kind
to
her
had
given
her
only
enough
bitterness
to
make
her
realise
the
sweetness
and
from
the
threads
that
life
had
placed
in
her
hands
at
the
beginning
had
taught
her
how
to
weave
the
blessed
fabric
of
content
aunt
peace
asked
the
girl
softly
have
you
forgotten
that
we
have
company
dispelled
by
the
voice
the
gracious
phantoms
of
memory
vanished
there
was
a
little
silence
then
the
old
lady
smiled
no
dearie
she
said
indeed
i
have
it
is
too
rare
a
blessing
for
me
to
forget
please
do
call
us
put
in
the
other
woman
quickly
because
we
not
observed
the
young
man
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hearth
is
extremely
good
under
the
circumstances
somebody
nearly
breaks
down
your
front
door
on
a
rainy
afternoon
and
when
you
rush
out
to
save
the
place
from
ruin
you
discover
two
dripping
tramps
on
your
steps
stranded
on
an
island
in
the
road
is
a
waggon
containing
their
trunks
from
which
place
of
refuge
they
recently
swam
to
your
door
do
you
do
aunt
peace
says
mother
come
to
live
with
you
from
this
time
on
to
the
finish
on
behalf
of
this
committee
ladies
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
for
calling
us
laughing
he
rose
and
made
an
exaggerated
courtesy
lynn
lynn
expostulated
his
mother
is
it
possible
that
after
all
my
explanations
you
do
understand
why
i
wrote
more
than
two
weeks
ago
asking
her
to
let
us
know
if
she
did
want
us
silence
always
gives
consent
and
so
we
came
yes
we
came
all
right
continued
the
boy
cheerfully
and
as
everybody
knows
we
here
now
but
is
it
just
like
a
woman
upon
my
word
i
think
they
queer
the
whole
tribe
having
thus
spoken
remarked
the
girl
you
might
tell
us
how
a
man
would
have
managed
it
very
easily
a
man
would
have
called
in
his
stenographer
no
he
would
either
because
it
was
a
personal
letter
he
would
have
made
an
excavation
into
his
desk
and
found
the
proper
stationery
and
would
have
put
in
a
new
pen
dear
aunt
peace
he
would
have
said
must
think
i
forgotten
you
because
i
have
written
for
such
a
long
time
if
i
had
written
every
time
i
had
wanted
to
or
had
thought
of
you
actually
you
have
been
bored
to
death
with
me
i
have
a
kid
who
thinks
he
is
going
to
be
a
fiddler
and
we
have
decided
to
come
and
live
with
you
while
he
finds
out
as
we
understand
that
herr
franz
kaufmann
who
is
not
unknown
to
fame
lives
in
your
village
will
you
please
let
us
know
if
you
ca
take
us
or
do
want
to
here
a
postage
stamp
and
no
hard
feelings
on
either
side
just
what
i
said
explained
irving
though
my
language
quite
like
yours
the
old
lady
smiled
again
my
dears
she
began
let
us
cease
this
unprofitable
discussion
it
is
all
because
we
are
so
far
out
of
the
beaten
track
that
we
seldom
go
to
the
i
am
sure
the
letter
is
there
now
i
will
get
it
replied
lynn
which
is
kind
of
me
considering
that
my
remarks
have
just
been
alluded
to
as
you
ca
expect
everybody
to
think
as
much
of
what
you
say
as
you
do
suggested
iris
with
a
trace
of
sarcasm
score
one
for
you
miss
temple
i
shall
now
retire
into
my
shell
so
saying
he
turned
to
the
fire
and
his
face
became
thoughtful
again
the
three
women
looked
at
him
from
widely
differing
points
of
view
the
girl
concealed
in
the
shadow
took
maidenly
account
of
his
tall
figure
his
dark
eyes
his
sensitive
mouth
and
his
firm
finely
modelled
chin
from
a
impulse
of
coquetry
she
was
glad
of
the
mood
which
had
led
her
to
put
on
her
most
becoming
gown
early
in
the
afternoon
the
situation
was
interesting
there
was
a
vague
hint
of
a
challenge
of
some
kind
aunt
peace
so
long
accustomed
to
quiet
ways
had
at
first
felt
the
two
an
intrusion
into
her
home
though
at
the
same
time
her
hospitable
instincts
reproached
her
bitterly
he
was
of
her
blood
and
her
line
yet
in
some
way
he
seemed
like
an
alien
suddenly
claiming
kinship
a
span
of
fifty
years
and
more
stretched
between
them
and
across
it
they
contemplated
each
other
both
wondering
for
his
part
he
regarded
her
as
one
might
a
cameo
of
fine
workmanship
or
an
old
miniature
she
was
so
passionless
so
virginal
so
far
removed
from
all
save
the
gentlest
emotions
that
he
saw
her
only
as
one
who
stood
apart
the
smile
still
lingered
upon
her
lips
and
the
firelight
made
shadows
beneath
her
serene
eyes
had
they
asked
her
for
her
thoughts
she
could
have
phrased
only
one
deep
down
in
her
heart
she
wondered
whether
anything
on
earth
had
ever
been
so
joyously
young
as
lynn
his
mother
too
was
watching
him
as
always
when
she
thought
herself
unobserved
in
spite
of
his
stalwart
manhood
to
her
he
was
still
a
child
forgiving
all
things
dreaming
all
things
hoping
all
things
with
the
boundless
faith
of
maternity
she
loved
him
through
the
child
that
he
was
for
the
man
that
he
might
be
loved
him
through
the
man
that
he
was
for
the
child
that
he
had
been
the
fire
had
died
down
and
iris
leaning
forward
laid
a
bit
of
pine
upon
the
dull
glow
in
the
midst
of
the
ashes
it
caught
quickly
and
once
again
the
magical
light
filled
the
room
sing
something
dear
said
aunt
peace
drowsily
and
iris
made
a
little
murmur
of
dissent
do
you
sing
miss
temple
asked
irving
politely
no
she
answered
and
what
more
i
know
i
do
but
aunt
peace
likes
to
hear
me
we
like
to
hear
you
too
said
irving
so
gently
that
no
one
could
have
refused
much
embarrassed
she
went
to
the
piano
which
stood
in
the
next
room
just
beyond
the
arch
and
struck
a
few
chords
the
instrument
was
old
and
worn
but
still
sweet
and
fearful
at
first
but
gaining
confidence
as
she
went
on
iris
sang
an
song
her
voice
was
contralto
deep
vibrant
and
full
but
untrained
still
there
were
evidences
of
study
and
of
work
along
right
lines
before
she
had
finished
irving
was
beside
her
resting
his
elbow
upon
the
piano
who
taught
you
he
asked
when
the
last
note
died
away
herr
kaufmann
she
replied
diffidently
i
thought
he
was
a
violin
teacher
he
is
then
how
can
he
teach
singing
he
does
irving
went
no
farther
and
miss
temple
realising
that
she
had
been
rude
hastened
to
atone
i
mean
by
that
she
explained
that
he
does
teach
anyone
but
me
i
had
a
few
lessons
a
long
time
ago
from
a
lady
who
spent
the
summer
here
and
he
has
been
helping
me
ever
since
that
is
all
he
says
it
does
matter
whether
people
have
voices
or
not
if
they
have
hearts
he
can
make
them
sing
you
play
do
you
yes
a
little
i
play
accompaniments
for
him
sometimes
then
you
play
with
me
wo
you
perhaps
when
i
see
laughed
iris
you
should
be
a
lawyer
instead
of
a
violinist
you
make
me
feel
as
if
i
were
on
the
witness
stand
my
father
was
a
lawyer
i
suppose
i
inherit
it
iris
had
a
question
upon
her
lips
but
checked
it
he
is
dead
the
young
man
went
on
as
though
in
answer
to
it
he
died
when
i
was
about
five
years
old
and
i
remember
him
scarcely
at
all
i
do
remember
either
father
or
mother
she
said
i
had
a
very
unhappy
childhood
and
things
that
happened
then
make
me
shudder
even
now
just
at
the
time
it
was
hardest
when
i
could
possibly
have
borne
any
more
aunt
peace
discovered
me
she
adopted
me
and
i
been
happy
ever
since
except
for
all
the
misery
i
ca
forget
she
not
really
your
aunt
then
no
legally
i
am
her
daughter
but
she
would
want
me
to
call
her
even
if
i
could
the
talk
in
the
other
room
had
become
merely
monosyllables
with
bits
of
understanding
silence
between
iris
went
back
and
irving
thanked
her
prettily
for
the
song
thank
you
for
listening
she
returned
come
aunt
peace
you
nodding
so
i
was
dearie
is
it
late
it
almost
ten
in
her
stately
fashion
miss
field
bade
her
guests
good
night
iris
lit
a
candle
and
followed
her
up
the
broad
winding
stairway
it
made
a
charming
picture
the
old
lady
in
her
trailing
gown
the
light
throwing
her
white
hair
into
bold
relief
and
the
girl
behind
her
smiling
back
over
the
banister
and
waving
her
hand
in
farewell
in
lynn
fond
sight
his
mother
was
very
lovely
as
she
sat
there
with
the
firelight
shining
upon
her
face
he
liked
the
way
her
dark
hair
grew
about
her
low
forehead
her
fair
smooth
skin
and
the
mysterious
depths
of
her
eyes
ever
since
he
could
remember
she
had
worn
a
black
gown
with
soft
folds
of
white
at
the
throat
and
wrists
it
time
to
go
out
for
our
walk
now
he
said
not
son
i
tired
that
does
make
any
difference
you
must
have
exercise
i
had
some
and
besides
it
wet
lynn
was
already
out
of
hearing
in
search
of
her
wraps
he
put
on
her
rubbers
paying
no
heed
to
her
protests
and
almost
before
she
knew
it
she
was
out
in
the
april
night
finding
a
certain
pleasure
in
his
quiet
mastery
the
storm
was
over
and
the
hidden
moon
silvered
the
edges
of
the
clouds
here
and
there
a
timid
planet
looked
out
from
behind
its
friendly
curtain
but
only
the
pole
star
kept
its
beacon
steadily
burning
the
air
was
sweet
with
the
freshness
of
the
rain
and
belated
drops
falling
from
the
trees
made
a
faint
patter
upon
the
ground
down
the
long
path
they
went
the
boy
eager
to
explore
the
unfamiliar
place
the
mother
harked
back
to
her
girlhood
thrilled
with
both
pleasure
and
pain
happy
are
they
who
leave
the
scenes
of
early
youth
to
the
ministry
of
time
going
back
one
finds
the
river
a
little
brook
the
long
stretch
of
woodland
only
a
grove
in
the
midst
of
a
clearing
and
the
upland
pastures
that
once
seemed
mountains
are
naught
but
stony
barren
fields
as
they
stood
upon
the
bridge
looking
down
into
the
rushing
waters
margaret
remembered
the
lost
majesty
of
that
narrow
stream
and
sighed
the
child
who
had
played
so
often
upon
its
banks
had
grown
to
a
woman
rich
with
life
deepest
experiences
but
the
brook
was
still
the
same
through
endless
years
it
must
be
the
same
drawing
its
waters
from
unseen
sources
while
generation
after
generation
withered
away
like
the
flowers
that
bloomed
upon
its
grassy
borders
while
the
years
were
young
lynn
broke
rudely
into
her
thoughts
i
wish
i
known
you
when
you
were
a
kid
mother
he
said
why
oh
i
think
i
have
liked
to
play
with
you
we
could
have
made
some
jolly
mud
pies
we
did
but
you
were
three
and
i
was
much
ashamed
too
i
remember
when
your
father
caught
me
doing
it
am
i
like
him
he
had
asked
the
question
many
times
and
her
answer
was
always
the
same
yes
very
much
like
him
he
was
a
good
man
lynn
do
i
look
like
him
yes
all
but
your
eyes
when
you
lived
here
did
you
know
herr
kaufmann
by
sight
yes
he
was
looking
straight
at
her
but
she
had
turned
her
face
away
forgetting
the
darkness
we
used
to
see
him
passing
in
the
street
she
went
on
in
a
different
tone
he
was
a
student
and
never
seemed
to
know
many
people
he
would
not
remember
me
then
there
no
use
of
my
telling
him
who
i
am
not
the
least
maybe
he
wo
take
me
yes
he
will
she
answered
though
her
heart
suddenly
misgave
her
he
must
there
is
no
other
way
will
you
go
with
me
no
indeed
you
must
go
alone
i
shall
not
appear
at
all
why
mother
because
it
was
her
woman
reason
which
he
had
learned
to
accept
as
final
beyond
that
there
was
no
appeal
east
lancaster
lay
on
one
side
of
the
brook
and
west
lancaster
on
the
other
the
two
settlements
were
quite
distinct
though
they
had
a
common
bond
of
interest
in
the
which
was
harmoniously
situated
near
the
border
line
east
lancaster
was
the
home
of
the
aristocracy
here
were
old
colonial
mansions
in
which
through
their
descendants
the
builders
still
lived
the
set
traditions
of
a
bygone
century
held
full
sway
in
the
place
but
though
circumscribed
by
conditions
the
upper
circle
proudly
considered
itself
complete
west
lancaster
was
on
a
hill
and
a
steep
one
at
that
hardy
german
immigrants
had
settled
there
much
to
the
disgust
of
east
lancaster
holding
itself
sternly
aloof
year
after
year
it
was
not
considered
good
form
to
allude
to
the
dwellers
upon
the
hill
save
in
low
tones
and
with
lifted
brows
yet
there
were
not
wanting
certain
good
samaritans
who
sent
warm
clothing
and
discarded
playthings
after
nightfall
and
by
stealth
to
the
little
teutons
who
lived
so
near
them
hemmed
in
by
the
everlasting
hills
estranged
from
its
neighbour
and
barely
upon
speaking
terms
with
other
towns
east
lancaster
let
the
world
go
on
by
two
trains
a
day
rushed
through
the
station
for
the
main
line
of
the
railroad
receiving
no
encouragement
from
east
lancaster
had
laid
its
tracks
elsewhere
it
was
still
spoken
of
as
the
time
when
if
you
will
remember
my
dear
they
endeavoured
to
ruin
our
property
with
dirt
and
noise
her
clothes
are
like
her
name
remarked
lynn
whose
clothes
asked
irving
taken
out
of
her
reverie
that
girl
she
had
on
a
green
dress
and
some
yellow
velvet
in
her
hair
her
eyes
are
purple
violet
you
mean
dear
did
you
notice
that
of
course
do
i
notice
everything
come
mother
i
race
you
to
the
top
of
the
hill
once
again
her
objections
were
of
no
avail
together
they
ran
laughing
up
the
winding
road
that
led
to
the
summit
stopping
very
soon
however
and
going
on
at
a
more
moderate
pace
the
street
was
narrow
and
the
houses
on
either
side
were
close
together
each
had
its
tiny
patch
of
ground
in
front
laid
out
in
bordered
with
whitewashed
stones
in
true
german
fashion
there
were
no
street
lamps
for
west
lancaster
also
resented
all
modern
innovations
but
in
the
spring
night
one
could
see
dimly
lanterns
flitted
here
and
there
like
fireflies
starred
against
the
dark
margaret
protested
that
she
was
tired
but
lynn
put
his
arm
around
her
and
hurried
her
on
never
before
had
she
set
foot
upon
the
soil
of
west
lancaster
but
she
had
full
knowledge
of
the
way
the
brow
of
the
hill
was
close
at
hand
and
she
caught
her
breath
in
sudden
fear
lynn
in
the
midst
of
a
graphic
recital
of
some
boyish
prank
took
no
note
of
her
agitation
he
did
not
even
know
that
they
had
come
to
the
end
of
their
journey
until
a
man
tiptoed
toward
them
his
finger
upon
his
lips
hush
he
breathed
the
master
plays
at
the
very
top
of
the
hill
almost
at
the
brink
of
the
precipice
was
a
house
so
small
that
it
seemed
more
like
a
box
than
a
dwelling
in
the
street
were
a
dozen
people
both
men
and
women
standing
in
stolid
patience
the
little
house
was
dark
but
a
window
was
open
and
from
within
muted
almost
to
a
whisper
came
the
voice
of
a
violin
for
an
hour
or
more
they
stood
there
listening
by
insensible
degrees
the
music
grew
in
volume
filled
with
breadth
and
splendour
yet
with
a
lyric
undertone
sounding
chords
caught
from
distant
silences
one
by
one
were
woven
in
songs
that
had
an
epic
grasp
question
prayer
and
heartbreak
all
the
pain
and
beauty
of
the
world
were
part
of
it
and
yet
there
was
something
more
to
lynn
trained
ear
it
was
an
improvisation
by
a
master
hand
he
was
lost
in
admiration
of
the
superb
technique
the
delicate
phrasing
and
the
wonderful
quality
of
the
tone
to
the
woman
beside
him
shaken
from
head
to
foot
by
unutterable
emotion
it
was
life
itself
bare
exquisitely
alive
tuned
to
the
breaking
point
a
human
thing
made
of
tears
and
laughter
of
ecstasy
tenderness
and
black
despair
lying
on
the
master
breast
and
answering
to
his
touch
the
shallows
touch
the
pebbles
and
behold
there
is
a
little
song
the
deeps
are
stirred
to
their
foundations
and
long
afterward
there
is
a
single
vast
strophe
majestic
and
immortal
which
takes
its
place
by
right
in
the
symphony
of
pain
to
margaret
standing
there
with
her
senses
swaying
all
her
possibilities
of
feeling
were
merged
into
one
unspeakable
hurt
take
me
away
she
whispered
i
can
bear
no
more
but
lynn
did
not
hear
he
was
simply
and
solely
the
musician
his
body
tense
his
head
bent
forward
and
a
little
to
one
side
nodding
in
emphasis
or
approval
she
slipped
her
arm
through
his
and
trembling
waited
as
best
she
might
for
the
end
it
came
at
last
and
the
little
group
near
them
took
up
its
separate
ways
someone
put
down
the
window
and
closed
the
shutters
the
master
knew
quite
well
that
some
of
his
neighbours
had
been
listening
but
it
pleased
him
to
ignore
the
tribute
no
one
dared
to
speak
to
him
about
his
playing
mother
mother
said
lynn
tenderly
i
been
selfish
and
i
kept
you
too
long
no
she
answered
but
her
lips
were
cold
and
her
voice
was
not
the
same
they
went
downhill
together
and
she
leaned
heavily
upon
his
supporting
arm
he
was
humming
under
his
breath
bits
of
the
improvisation
and
did
not
speak
again
until
they
were
at
home
the
fire
was
out
but
iris
had
left
two
lighted
candles
on
a
table
in
the
hall
a
fine
violin
he
said
by
far
the
finest
i
have
ever
heard
yes
she
returned
a
cremona
that
is
i
think
it
must
be
from
its
tone
possibly
good
night
and
pleasant
dreams
they
parted
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
down
on
the
landing
the
tall
clock
chimed
twelve
margaret
lay
for
a
long
time
with
her
eyes
closed
but
none
the
less
awake
toward
dawn
the
ghostly
fingers
of
her
dreams
tapped
questioningly
at
the
master
door
but
without
disturbing
his
sleep
ii
mine
cremona
lynn
went
up
the
hill
with
a
long
swinging
stride
the
morning
was
in
his
heart
and
it
seemed
good
to
be
alive
his
blood
fairly
sang
in
his
pulses
and
his
cheery
whistle
was
as
natural
and
unconscious
as
the
call
of
the
robin
in
the
maple
thicket
beyond
the
german
housewives
left
their
work
and
came
out
to
see
him
pass
for
strangers
in
west
lancaster
were
so
infrequent
as
to
cause
extended
comment
and
he
left
behind
him
a
trail
of
sharp
glances
and
nodding
heads
the
entire
hill
was
instantly
alive
with
gossip
which
buzzed
back
and
forth
like
a
hive
of
liberated
bees
it
was
a
sturdy
dame
near
the
summit
who
quelled
it
for
the
time
being
so
she
said
to
her
neighbour
i
was
right
he
will
be
going
to
the
master
the
word
went
quickly
down
the
line
and
after
various
speculations
regarding
his
possible
errand
the
neglected
household
tasks
were
taken
up
and
the
hill
was
quiet
again
except
for
the
children
who
played
stolidly
in
their
bits
of
dooryards
lynn
easily
recognised
the
house
though
he
had
seen
it
but
dimly
the
night
before
it
was
two
stories
in
height
but
very
small
and
in
some
occult
way
reminded
one
of
a
it
was
perched
almost
upon
the
ledge
and
its
western
windows
overlooked
the
valley
filled
with
tossing
willow
plumes
the
winding
river
half
asleep
in
its
mantle
of
grey
and
silver
and
the
range
of
blue
hills
beyond
it
was
the
only
house
upon
the
hill
which
boasted
two
front
entrances
through
the
shining
windows
of
the
lower
story
on
a
level
with
the
street
he
saw
violins
in
all
stages
of
making
but
otherwise
the
room
was
empty
so
he
climbed
the
short
flight
of
steps
and
rang
the
bell
the
wire
was
slack
and
rusty
but
after
two
or
three
trials
a
mournful
clang
came
from
the
depths
of
the
interior
at
last
the
door
was
opened
cautiously
by
a
woman
whose
flushed
face
and
red
wrinkled
fingers
betrayed
her
recent
occupation
i
beg
your
pardon
said
irving
making
his
best
bow
is
herr
kaufmann
at
home
not
yet
she
replied
he
will
have
gone
for
his
walk
you
will
be
coming
in
she
asked
the
question
as
though
she
feared
an
affirmative
answer
if
i
may
please
he
returned
carefully
wiping
his
feet
upon
the
mat
do
you
expect
him
soon
yes
she
ushered
him
into
the
front
room
and
pointed
to
a
chair
you
will
please
excuse
me
she
said
certainly
do
not
let
me
detain
you
left
to
himself
he
looked
about
the
room
with
amused
curiosity
the
furnishings
were
a
queer
combination
of
primitive
american
ideas
and
modern
german
fancies
overlaid
with
a
feminine
love
of
superfluous
ornament
the
teutonic
fondness
for
colour
ran
riot
in
everything
and
purples
reds
and
yellows
were
closely
intermingled
the
exquisite
neatness
of
the
place
was
its
redeeming
feature
apparently
there
were
two
other
rooms
on
the
same
floor
a
combined
kitchen
and
was
just
back
of
the
parlour
and
a
smaller
room
opened
off
of
it
lynn
was
meditating
upon
herr
household
arrangements
when
a
wonderful
object
upon
the
table
in
the
corner
attracted
his
attention
and
he
went
over
to
examine
it
obviously
it
had
once
been
a
section
of
clay
drainage
pipe
but
in
its
sublimated
estate
it
was
far
removed
from
common
uses
it
had
been
smeared
with
putty
and
while
plastic
ornamented
with
hinges
nails
keys
clock
wheels
curtain
rings
and
various
other
things
not
usually
associated
with
drainage
pipes
when
dry
it
had
been
given
further
distinction
by
two
or
three
coats
of
gold
paint
a
wire
placed
conspicuously
near
the
top
of
it
was
rendered
so
ridiculous
by
the
gilding
that
lynn
laughed
aloud
then
influenced
by
the
sound
of
the
close
at
hand
he
endeavoured
to
cover
it
with
a
cough
he
was
too
late
however
for
almost
immediately
his
hostess
appeared
in
the
doorway
mine
crazy
jug
she
said
with
gratified
pride
beaming
from
every
feature
i
was
just
looking
at
it
responded
lynn
it
is
marvellous
did
you
make
it
yourself
yes
i
make
him
mineself
she
said
and
then
retreated
blushing
with
innocent
pleasure
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
he
went
back
to
his
chair
and
sat
down
again
carefully
avoiding
the
purple
tidy
embroidered
with
pink
roses
outside
the
street
was
deserted
he
wondered
what
type
of
a
man
it
was
who
could
live
in
the
same
house
with
a
crazy
jug
and
play
as
herr
kaufmann
played
only
last
night
then
he
reflected
that
the
room
had
been
dark
and
smiled
at
his
foolish
fancy
a
square
piano
took
up
one
whole
side
of
the
room
and
there
were
two
violins
upon
it
unthinkingly
lynn
investigated
the
first
one
was
a
good
instrument
of
modern
make
and
the
other
he
caught
his
breath
as
he
took
it
out
of
its
case
the
thin
fine
shell
was
the
beautiful
body
of
a
cremona
enshrining
a
cremona
still
more
beautiful
soul
he
touched
it
reverently
though
his
hands
trembled
and
his
face
was
aglow
he
snapped
a
string
with
his
finger
and
the
violin
answered
with
a
deep
resonant
tone
but
before
the
sound
had
died
away
there
was
an
exclamation
of
horror
in
his
ears
and
a
firm
grip
upon
his
arm
mine
brudder
cremona
cried
the
woman
her
eyes
flashing
lightnings
of
anger
you
will
at
once
put
him
down
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
i
did
not
realise
i
did
not
mean
i
did
not
understand
he
went
on
with
confused
explanations
and
apologies
which
availed
him
nothing
he
stood
before
her
convicted
and
shamed
as
one
who
had
profaned
the
household
god
wiping
her
hands
upon
her
apron
she
went
to
her
took
out
her
knitting
and
sat
down
between
lynn
and
the
piano
the
chair
was
hard
and
uncompromising
with
an
upright
back
but
she
disdained
even
that
support
and
sat
proudly
erect
there
was
no
sound
save
the
click
of
the
needles
and
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
upon
her
work
after
an
awkward
silence
lynn
made
one
or
two
tentative
efforts
toward
conversation
but
each
opening
proved
fruitless
and
at
length
he
seriously
meditated
flight
the
approach
to
the
door
was
covered
but
there
were
plenty
of
windows
and
it
would
be
an
easy
drop
to
the
ground
he
smiled
as
he
saw
himself
mentally
achieving
escape
in
this
manner
and
running
all
the
way
home
i
wonder
he
mused
where
in
the
dickens
brudder
is
the
face
of
the
woman
before
him
was
still
flushed
and
the
movement
of
the
needles
betrayed
her
excitement
he
noted
that
she
wore
no
wedding
ring
and
surmised
that
she
was
a
little
older
than
his
mother
her
features
were
hard
and
her
thin
straight
hair
was
brushed
tightly
back
and
fastened
in
a
little
knot
at
the
back
of
her
head
it
was
not
unlike
a
door
knob
and
he
began
to
wonder
what
would
happen
if
he
should
turn
it
his
irrepressible
spirits
bubbled
over
and
he
coughed
violently
into
his
handkerchief
feeling
himself
closely
scrutinised
meanwhile
the
situation
was
relieved
by
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
the
vigorous
slam
of
the
lower
door
still
keeping
the
piano
with
its
precious
burden
within
range
of
her
vision
fräulein
kaufmann
moved
toward
the
door
franz
franz
she
called
come
here
one
minute
the
voice
was
deep
and
musical
and
had
a
certain
lyric
quality
when
he
came
up
there
was
a
conversation
in
indignant
german
which
was
brief
but
sufficient
i
can
see
said
lynn
to
himself
that
i
am
not
to
study
with
herr
kaufmann
just
then
he
came
in
gave
lynn
a
quick
suspicious
glance
took
up
the
cremona
and
strode
out
he
was
gone
so
long
that
lynn
decided
to
retreat
in
good
order
he
picked
up
his
hat
and
was
half
way
out
of
his
chair
when
he
heard
footsteps
and
waited
now
said
the
master
you
would
like
to
speak
with
me
he
was
of
medium
height
had
keen
dark
eyes
bushy
brows
ruddy
cheeks
and
a
mass
of
grey
hair
which
he
occasionally
shook
back
like
a
mane
he
had
the
typical
hands
of
the
violinist
yes
answered
lynn
i
want
to
study
with
you
study
what
herr
kaufmann
tone
was
somewhat
brusque
manners
the
violin
explained
irving
flushing
so
you
make
violins
no
i
want
to
play
oh
said
the
other
looking
at
him
sharply
it
is
to
play
well
i
can
teach
you
nothing
he
rose
as
though
to
intimate
that
the
interview
was
at
an
end
but
lynn
was
not
so
easily
turned
aside
herr
kaufmann
he
began
i
have
come
hundreds
of
miles
to
study
with
you
we
have
broken
up
our
home
and
have
come
to
live
in
east
lancaster
for
that
one
purpose
i
am
flattered
observed
the
master
dryly
may
i
ask
how
you
have
heard
of
me
so
far
away
as
many
hundred
miles
why
everybody
knows
of
you
when
i
was
a
little
child
i
can
remember
my
mother
telling
me
that
some
day
i
should
study
with
the
great
herr
kaufmann
it
is
the
dream
of
her
life
and
of
mine
a
bad
dream
remarked
the
violinist
succinctly
may
i
ask
your
mother
name
irving
margaret
irving
margaret
repeated
the
old
man
in
a
different
tone
margaret
there
was
a
long
silence
then
the
boy
began
once
more
you
take
me
wo
you
for
an
instant
the
master
seemed
on
the
point
of
yielding
unconditionally
then
he
came
to
himself
with
a
start
one
moment
he
said
clearing
his
throat
why
did
you
lift
up
mine
cremona
the
piercing
eyes
were
upon
him
and
lynn
colour
mounted
to
his
temples
but
he
met
the
gaze
honestly
i
scarcely
know
why
he
answered
i
was
here
alone
i
had
been
waiting
a
long
time
and
it
has
always
been
natural
for
me
to
look
at
violins
i
think
we
all
do
things
for
which
we
can
give
no
reason
i
certainly
had
no
intention
of
harming
it
nor
of
offending
anybody
i
am
very
sorry
well
sighed
the
master
i
should
not
have
left
it
out
strangers
seldom
come
here
but
i
too
was
to
blame
fredrika
takes
it
to
herself
she
thinks
that
she
should
have
left
her
scrubbing
and
sat
with
you
but
of
that
i
am
not
so
sure
it
is
mine
cremona
he
went
on
bitterly
nobody
touches
it
but
mineself
his
distress
was
very
real
and
for
the
first
time
irving
felt
a
throb
of
sympathy
however
unreasonable
it
might
be
however
weak
and
childish
he
saw
that
he
had
unwittingly
touched
a
tender
place
all
the
love
of
the
hale
old
heart
was
centred
upon
the
violin
wooden
inanimate
but
no
nothing
can
be
inanimate
which
is
sweetheart
and
child
in
one
herr
kaufmann
said
lynn
believe
me
if
any
act
of
mine
could
wipe
away
my
touch
i
should
do
it
here
and
now
as
it
is
i
can
only
ask
your
pardon
we
will
no
longer
speak
of
it
returned
the
master
with
quiet
dignity
we
will
attempt
to
forget
he
went
to
the
window
and
stood
with
his
back
to
irving
for
a
long
time
what
could
i
have
done
thought
lynn
i
only
picked
it
up
and
laid
it
down
again
i
surely
did
not
harm
it
he
was
too
young
to
see
that
it
was
the
significance
rather
than
the
touch
that
the
old
man
felt
as
a
lover
might
who
saw
his
beloved
in
the
arms
of
another
the
bloom
was
gone
from
the
fruit
the
fragrance
from
the
rose
for
years
and
more
the
cremona
had
been
sacredly
kept
the
master
thoughts
had
leaped
that
at
a
single
bound
again
he
stood
in
the
woods
beyond
east
lancaster
while
the
sky
was
dark
with
threatening
clouds
and
the
dead
leaves
scurried
in
fright
before
the
north
wind
beside
him
stood
a
girl
of
twenty
her
face
white
and
her
sweet
mouth
quivering
you
must
take
it
she
was
saying
it
is
mine
to
do
with
as
i
please
and
no
one
will
ever
know
if
anyone
asks
i
can
fix
it
someway
it
is
part
of
myself
that
i
give
you
so
that
in
all
the
years
you
will
not
forget
me
when
you
touch
it
it
will
be
as
though
you
took
my
hand
in
yours
when
it
sings
to
you
it
will
be
my
voice
saying
love
you
and
in
it
you
will
find
all
the
sweetness
of
this
one
short
year
all
the
pain
will
be
blotted
out
and
only
the
joy
will
be
left
the
joy
that
we
can
never
know
her
voice
broke
in
a
sob
then
the
picture
faded
in
a
mist
of
blinding
tears
dull
thunders
boomed
afar
and
he
felt
her
lips
crushed
for
an
instant
against
his
own
when
clear
sight
came
back
the
storm
was
raging
and
he
was
alone
irving
waited
impatiently
for
he
was
restless
and
longed
to
get
away
but
he
dared
not
speak
at
last
the
old
man
turned
away
from
the
window
his
face
haggard
and
grey
you
will
take
me
asked
lynn
with
a
note
of
pleading
in
his
question
yes
sighed
the
master
i
take
you
tuesdays
and
fridays
at
ten
bring
your
violin
and
what
music
you
have
we
will
see
what
you
have
done
and
what
you
can
do
he
did
not
seem
to
see
lynn
offered
hand
and
the
boy
went
out
sorely
troubled
by
something
which
seemed
just
outside
his
comprehension
he
walked
for
an
hour
in
the
woods
before
going
home
and
in
answer
to
questions
merely
said
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
wait
for
some
time
but
that
everything
was
satisfactorily
arranged
is
he
an
old
dear
asked
iris
i
do
know
answered
lynn

iii
the
gift
of
peace
the
mistress
of
the
mansion
was
giving
her
orders
for
the
day
from
the
farthest
nooks
and
corners
of
the
attic
where
fragrant
herbs
swayed
back
and
forth
in
ghostly
fashion
to
the
tiled
kitchen
where
burnished
copper
saucepans
literally
shone
miss
field
kept
in
daily
touch
with
her
housekeeping
the
old
colonial
house
was
her
pride
and
her
delight
it
was
by
far
the
oldest
in
that
part
of
the
country
and
held
an
exalted
position
among
its
neighbours
on
that
account
though
the
owner
not
having
spent
her
entire
life
in
east
lancaster
was
considered
somewhat
new
to
be
truly
aristocratic
at
least
three
generations
of
one
forbears
must
have
lived
in
the
same
dwelling
in
the
hall
hung
the
old
family
portraits
gentlemen
and
gentlewomen
long
since
gathered
to
their
fathers
had
looked
down
from
their
gilded
frames
upon
many
a
strange
scene
baby
footsteps
had
faltered
on
the
stairs
and
wide
childish
eyes
had
looked
up
in
awe
to
this
stately
company
older
children
had
wondered
at
the
patches
and
the
powdered
hair
the
velvet
knickerbockers
and
ruffled
sleeves
awkward
schoolboys
had
boasted
to
their
mates
that
the
jewelled
sword
which
hung
at
the
side
of
a
young
officer
in
the
uniform
of
the
colonies
had
been
presented
by
general
washington
himself
in
recognition
of
conspicuous
bravery
upon
the
field
lovers
had
led
their
sweethearts
along
the
hall
at
twilight
to
whisper
that
their
portraits
too
should
some
day
hang
there
side
by
side
soldiers
of
fortune
who
had
found
their
leader
fickle
had
taken
fresh
courage
from
the
set
lips
of
the
gallant
gentlemen
in
the
great
hall
women
whose
hearts
were
breaking
had
looked
up
to
the
painted
and
powdered
dames
along
the
winding
stairway
and
learned
through
some
subtle
freemasonry
of
sex
that
only
the
lowborn
cry
out
when
hurt
faint
wailing
voices
of
babes
had
reached
the
listening
ears
of
the
portraits
by
night
and
by
day
coffin
after
coffin
had
gone
out
of
the
wide
door
and
step
after
step
had
died
away
forever
leaving
only
an
echo
behind
and
yet
the
men
and
women
of
the
line
of
field
looked
out
from
their
gilded
frames
courageous
and
serene
with
here
and
there
the
hint
of
a
smile
far
up
the
stairs
and
beyond
the
turn
hung
the
last
portrait
aunt
peace
in
the
bloom
of
her
mature
beauty
painted
soon
after
she
had
taken
possession
of
the
house
the
dark
hair
was
parted
over
the
low
brow
and
puffed
slightly
over
the
tiny
ears
the
flowered
gown
was
cut
modestly
away
at
the
throat
showing
a
shoulder
line
that
had
been
famous
in
three
counties
when
she
was
the
belle
of
the
countryside
for
the
rest
she
was
much
the
same
let
the
artist
make
the
brown
hair
snowy
white
change
the
girlish
bloom
to
the
tint
of
a
faded
pink
rose
draw
around
the
eyes
and
the
mouth
a
few
tiny
which
after
all
were
but
the
footprints
of
smiles
sadden
the
trustful
eyes
a
bit
and
cover
the
frivolous
gown
with
black
brocade
then
the
mistress
of
the
mansion
who
moved
so
gaily
through
the
house
would
inevitably
startle
you
as
you
came
upon
her
at
the
turn
of
the
stairs
having
believed
all
the
time
that
she
was
somewhere
else
at
the
moment
she
was
in
the
garden
with
irving
and
the
children
as
she
called
iris
and
lynn
now
my
talented
she
was
saying
in
her
high
sweet
voice
will
you
kindly
take
the
spade
and
dig
until
you
can
dig
no
more
i
am
well
aware
that
it
is
like
hitching
pegasus
to
the
plough
but
i
have
grown
tired
of
waiting
for
my
intermittent
gardener
and
there
is
a
new
theory
to
the
effect
that
all
service
is
beautiful
so
it
is
laughed
lynn
turning
the
earth
awkwardly
i
know
what
you
thinking
of
mother
but
it
is
going
to
hurt
my
hands
you
shall
have
a
for
your
reward
aunt
peace
went
on
i
will
take
the
front
yard
myself
and
the
beds
here
shall
be
equally
divided
among
you
three
you
may
plant
in
them
what
you
please
and
each
shall
attend
to
his
own
i
speak
for
vegetables
said
lynn
how
characteristic
murmured
iris
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
him
which
sent
the
blood
to
his
face
what
shall
you
plant
mrs
irving
roses
heartsease
and
verbenas
she
replied
and
as
many
other
things
as
i
can
get
in
without
crowding
i
may
change
my
mind
about
the
others
but
i
shall
have
those
three
what
are
you
going
to
have
violets
and
mignonette
nothing
more
i
love
the
sweet
modest
ones
the
best
cucumbers
tomatoes
corn
melons
peas
asparagus
put
in
lynn
and
what
else
nothing
else
my
son
answered
margaret
unless
you
rent
a
vacant
acre
or
two
the
seeds
are
small
but
the
plants
have
been
known
to
spread
i
have
one
plant
of
each
kind
then
for
i
must
assuredly
have
variety
it
said
to
be
spice
of
life
and
that
what
we
all
looking
for
besides
judging
from
the
various
scornful
remarks
which
have
been
thought
if
not
actually
made
the
rest
of
you
do
care
for
vegetables
anyhow
you
have
any
except
aunt
peace
over
here
now
please
lynn
said
miss
field
when
you
get
that
done
i
tell
you
what
to
do
next
come
margaret
it
a
little
chilly
here
and
i
do
want
you
to
take
cold
for
a
few
moments
there
was
quiet
in
the
garden
a
flock
of
pigeons
hovered
about
iris
taking
grain
from
her
outstretched
hand
and
cooing
soft
murmurs
of
content
the
white
dove
was
perched
upon
her
shoulder
not
at
all
disturbed
by
her
various
excursions
to
the
source
of
supply
lynn
worked
steadily
seemingly
unconscious
of
the
girl
scrutiny
finally
she
spoke
i
do
want
any
of
your
old
vegetables
she
said
how
fortunate
you
may
not
have
any
at
all
i
do
believe
the
seeds
will
come
up
perhaps
not
it
quite
in
the
nature
of
things
the
pouter
pigeon
brave
in
his
iridescent
waistcoat
perched
upon
her
other
shoulder
and
lynn
straightened
himself
to
look
at
her
from
the
first
evening
she
had
puzzled
him
her
face
was
nearly
always
pale
but
she
had
a
pretty
colour
in
her
cheeks
and
her
deep
violet
eyes
were
aglow
with
innocent
mischief
there
was
a
dewy
sweetness
about
her
red
lips
and
lynn
noted
that
the
sheen
on
the
pigeon
breast
was
like
the
gleam
from
her
hair
where
the
sun
shone
upon
it
she
had
a
great
mass
of
it
which
she
wore
coiled
on
top
of
her
small
head
it
was
perfectly
smooth
its
riotous
waves
kept
well
in
check
except
at
the
temples
where
little
ringlets
clustered
unrebuked
you
should
be
practising
said
iris
irrelevantly
so
should
you
i
do
need
to
why
not
because
i
not
going
to
play
with
you
any
more
why
iris
oh
she
returned
with
a
little
shrug
of
her
shoulders
which
frightened
away
both
pigeons
you
did
like
the
way
i
played
your
last
accompaniment
and
so
i
stopped
for
good
lynn
thought
it
only
a
repetition
of
what
she
had
said
when
he
criticised
her
and
passed
it
over
in
silence
i
already
done
an
hour
he
said
and
i
have
time
for
another
before
lunch
i
can
get
in
the
other
two
before
dark
and
then
going
for
a
walk
you
come
with
me
wo
you
you
have
asked
me
properly
she
objected
irving
bowed
and
in
set
gallant
phrases
asked
miss
temple
for
the
pleasure
of
her
company
i
sorry
she
answered
but
i
obliged
to
refuse
i
going
to
make
some
little
cakes
for
tea
the
kind
you
like
bother
the
cakes
then
laughed
iris
if
you
want
me
as
much
as
that
i
go
it
my
christian
duty
from
the
very
beginning
aunt
peace
had
taught
iris
the
principles
of
dainty
housewifery
cleanliness
came
first
an
exquisite
cleanliness
which
was
not
merely
a
lack
of
dust
and
dirt
but
a
positive
quality
when
the
old
lady
keen
eyes
reinforced
by
her
strongest
glasses
were
unable
to
discern
so
much
as
a
finger
mark
upon
anything
iris
knew
that
it
was
clean
and
not
before
at
first
the
little
untrained
child
had
bitterly
rebelled
but
miss
field
patience
was
without
limit
and
at
last
iris
attained
the
required
degree
of
proficiency
she
had
done
her
sampler
like
the
colonial
maids
before
her
made
her
white
sweet
loaves
her
fragrant
brown
ones
put
up
her
countless
pots
of
clear
rich
preserves
made
amber
and
crimson
jellies
huge
jars
of
spiced
fruits
and
brewed
ten
different
kinds
of
wine
then
and
not
till
then
iris
got
the
womanly
idea
which
was
beneath
it
all
perception
came
slowly
but
at
length
she
found
herself
in
a
beautiful
comradeship
with
aunt
peace
for
sheer
love
of
the
daintiness
of
it
iris
beat
the
yolks
of
eggs
in
a
white
bowl
and
the
whites
in
a
blue
one
she
took
pleasure
out
of
various
fine
textures
and
feathery
masses
sang
as
she
shaped
small
pats
of
unsalted
butter
tying
them
up
in
clover
blossoms
and
laughed
at
the
little
packets
of
seeds
dame
nature
sends
with
her
parcels
see
said
iris
one
morning
as
she
cut
a
juicy
muskmelon
and
took
out
the
seeds
this
means
that
if
you
like
it
well
enough
to
work
and
wait
you
can
have
lots
lots
more
miss
field
smiled
and
a
soft
pink
colour
came
into
her
fine
face
for
one
at
least
she
had
opened
the
way
to
the
fortunate
isles
where
one
daily
work
is
one
daily
happiness
and
nothing
is
so
poor
as
to
be
without
its
own
appealing
beauty
as
time
went
on
iris
found
deep
and
satisfying
pleasure
in
the
countless
little
things
that
were
done
each
day
she
piled
the
clean
linen
in
orderly
rows
upon
the
shelves
delighting
in
the
unnameable
freshness
made
by
wind
and
sun
sniffed
appreciatively
at
the
cedar
chest
which
stood
in
a
recess
of
the
upper
hall
and
climbed
many
a
chair
to
fasten
bunches
of
fragrant
herbs
gathered
with
her
own
hands
to
the
rafters
in
the
attic
she
washed
the
fine
old
china
rubbed
the
mahogany
till
she
could
see
her
face
in
it
and
kept
the
silver
shining
a
gentlewoman
aunt
peace
had
said
will
always
be
independent
of
her
servants
and
there
are
certain
things
no
gentlewoman
will
trust
her
servants
to
do
upon
this
foundation
aunt
peace
had
reared
the
beautiful
superstructure
of
her
life
her
hands
were
capable
and
strong
yet
soft
and
white
as
we
learn
to
love
the
things
we
take
care
of
so
every
household
possession
became
dear
to
her
and
repaid
her
for
her
labours
an
to
be
sure
of
doing
the
very
best
for
her
adopted
daughter
miss
field
had
for
many
years
kept
house
without
a
servant
now
at
she
had
grudgingly
admitted
one
maid
into
her
sanctum
but
some
of
the
work
still
fell
to
iris
and
no
one
ever
doubted
for
an
instant
that
the
head
of
the
household
vigilantly
guarded
her
own
rights
for
a
long
time
iris
had
known
how
useless
it
was
that
there
had
never
been
a
moment
when
the
old
lady
could
not
have
had
a
retinue
of
servants
at
her
command
but
had
it
been
useless
after
all
remembering
the
child
she
had
been
iris
could
not
but
see
the
immeasurable
advance
the
woman
had
made
someday
my
child
aunt
peace
had
said
when
your
adopted
mother
is
laid
away
with
her
ancestors
in
the
churchyard
you
will
bless
me
for
what
i
have
done
you
will
see
that
wherever
you
happen
to
be
in
whatever
station
of
life
god
may
be
pleased
to
place
you
after
i
am
gone
you
have
one
thing
which
can
not
be
taken
away
from
you
the
power
to
make
for
yourself
a
home
you
will
be
sure
of
your
comfort
independently
and
you
will
never
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
ignorant
and
the
untrained
in
more
than
one
sense
went
on
miss
field
smiling
you
will
have
the
gift
of
peace
in
the
house
in
her
favourite
chair
by
the
fire
the
old
lady
was
saying
much
the
same
thing
to
margaret
irving
it
was
apropos
of
a
book
written
by
a
member
of
the
shrieking
sisterhood
which
had
sorely
stirred
east
lancaster
set
as
it
was
in
quiet
ways
that
were
centuries
old
i
have
no
patience
with
such
foolishness
aunt
peace
observed
since
adam
and
eve
were
placed
in
the
garden
of
eden
women
have
been
and
men
have
been
all
the
work
in

directly
and
immediately
undertaken

and
betterment
of

home

who
has
no
love
for
it
is
unsexed
god
probably
knew
how
he
wanted
it
at
least
we
may
be
pardoned
for
supposing
that
he
did
it
is
absolutely
but
i
would
better
stop
my
dear
i
fear
i
shall
soon
be
saying
something
unladylike
margaret
laughed
a
low
musical
laugh
with
a
girlish
note
in
it
for
a
long
time
she
had
not
been
so
happy
as
she
was
to
quote
a
famous
historian
she
replied
a
book
like
that
within
itself
the
germs
of
its
decay
you
need
have
no
fear
aunt
peace
the
home
will
stand
this
single
house
this
beautiful
old
home
of
yours
has
lasted
two
centuries
has
it
just
as
it
is
yes
sighed
the
other
after
a
pause
they
built
well
in
those
days
the
charm
of
the
room
was
upon
them
both
through
the
open
door
they
could
see
the
long
line
of
portraits
in
the
hall
and
the
house
seemed
peopled
with
friendly
ghosts
whose
memories
and
loves
still
lived
because
she
had
recently
come
from
a
city
apartment
margaret
looked
down
the
spacious
vista
ending
at
a
long
mirror
with
an
sense
of
delight
my
dear
said
miss
field
i
have
always
felt
that
this
house
should
have
come
to
you
i
have
never
felt
so
answered
margaret
i
have
never
for
a
moment
begrudged
it
to
you
you
know
my
father
died
suddenly
and
his
will
made
long
before
i
was
born
had
not
been
changed
so
what
was
more
natural
than
for
my
mother
to
have
the
house
during
her
lifetime
with
the
provision
that
it
should
revert
to
his
favourite
sister
afterward
if
she
still
lived
i
have
cheated
you
by
living
margaret
and
your
mother
was
cut
off
in
her
prime
she
was
a
hard
woman
yes
sighed
margaret
she
was
but
i
think
she
meant
to
be
kind
i
knew
her
very
little
in
fact
the
only
chance
that
i
ever
had
to
get
acquainted
with
her
was
when
i
came
here
for
a
short
visit
just
after
you
were
married
the
house
had
been
closed
for
a
long
time
she
took
you
away
with
her
and
when
she
came
back
she
was
alone
then
she
wrote
to
me
asking
me
to
share
her
loneliness
for
a
time
and
i
consented
the
way
was
open
for
confidences
but
margaret
made
none
and
aunt
peace
respected
her
for
it
we
never
knew
each
other
very
well
did
we
asked
the
old
lady
in
a
tone
that
indicated
no
need
of
an
answer
i
remember
that
when
i
was
here
i
yearned
over
you
just
as
i
did
over
iris
several
years
later
i
wanted
to
give
to
you
out
of
my
abundance
to
make
you
happy
and
comfortable
dear
aunt
peace
said
margaret
softly
you
are
doing
it
now
when
perhaps
i
need
it
even
more
than
i
did
then
all
your
life
you
have
been
making
people
happy
and
comfortable
i
hope
so
it
is
what
i
have
tried
to
do
by
the
way
when
i
am
through
with
it
this
house
goes
to
you
then
to
lynn
and
his
children
after
him
thank
you
for
an
instant
margaret
pulses
throbbed
with
the
joy
of
possession
then
the
blood
retreated
from
her
heart
in
shame
i
have
made
ample
provision
for
iris
miss
field
went
on
she
is
my
own
dear
daughter
but
she
is
not
of
our
line
at
this
moment
iris
came
around
the
house
laughing
and
screaming
with
lynn
in
full
pursuit
irving
went
to
the
window
and
came
back
with
an
amused
light
in
her
eyes
what
is
the
matter
asked
aunt
peace
lynn
is
chasing
her
he
had
something
in
his
fingers
that
looked
like
an
no
doubt
iris
is
afraid
of
worms
i
go
out
and
speak
to
him
no
let
them
fight
it
out
we
are
never
young
but
once
and
youth
asks
no
greater
privilege
than
to
fight
its
own
battles
it
is
mistaken
kindness
to
shield
it
weakens
one
in
the
years
to
come
youth
repeated
margaret
the
most
beautiful
gift
of
the
gods
which
we
never
appreciate
until
it
is
gone
forever
i
have
kept
mine
said
aunt
peace
i
have
deliberately
forgotten
all
the
unpleasant
things
and
remembered
the
others
when
a
little
pleasure
has
flashed
for
a
moment
against
the
dark
i
have
made
that
jewel
mine
i
have
hundreds
of
them
from
the
time
my
baby
fingers
clasped
my
first
rose
to
the
night
you
and
lynn
came
to
bring
more
sunshine
into
my
old
life
i
call
it
my
necklace
of
perfect
joy
when
the
world
goes
wrong
i
have
only
to
close
my
eyes
and
remember
all
the
links
in
my
chain
set
with
gems
some
large
and
some
small
but
all
beautiful
with
the
beauty
which
never
fades
it
is
all
i
can
take
with
me
when
i
go
my
material
possessions
must
stay
behind
but
my
necklace
of
perfect
joy
will
bring
me
happiness
to
the
end
when
i
put
it
on
to
be
nevermore
unclasped
aunt
peace
asked
margaret
after
an
understanding
silence
why
did
you
never
marry
miss
field
leaned
forward
and
methodically
stirred
the
fire
i
may
be
wrong
she
said
but
i
have
always
felt
that
it
was
indelicate
to
allow
one
self
to
care
for
a
gentleman
iv
social
position
on
wednesday
the
dullest
person
might
have
felt
that
there
was
something
in
the
air
the
old
house
already
exquisitely
clean
received
further
polishing
without
protest
savoury
odours
came
from
the
kitchen
and
iris
rubbed
the
tall
silver
candlesticks
until
they
shone
like
new
what
is
it
asked
lynn
are
we
going
to
have
a
party
and
am
i
invited
it
is
wednesday
explained
iris
well
what
of
it
doctor
brinkerhoff
comes
to
see
aunt
peace
every
wednesday
evening
who
is
doctor
brinkerhoff
the
family
physician
of
east
lancaster
he
was
here
last
wednesday
that
was
because
you
and
your
mother
had
just
come
aunt
peace
sent
him
a
note
saying
that
her
attention
was
for
the
moment
occupied
by
other
guests
from
out
of
town
it
was
the
first
wednesday
evening
he
has
missed
for
more
than
ten
years
oh
said
lynn
are
they
going
to
be
married
aunt
peace
would
marry
anybody
she
receives
doctor
brinkerhoff
because
she
is
sorry
for
him
he
has
no
social
position
iris
continued
feeling
the
unspoken
question
he
is
not
of
our
class
and
he
used
to
live
in
west
lancaster
but
aunt
peace
says
that
any
gentleman
who
is
received
by
a
lady
in
her
bedroom
may
also
be
received
in
her
parlour
another
lady
who
thinks
as
aunt
peace
does
entertains
him
on
saturday
evenings
iris
sat
there
demurely
her
rosy
lips
primly
pursed
and
vigorously
rubbed
the
tall
candlestick
lynn
fairly
choked
with
laughter
oh
he
cried
you
funny
little
thing
i
am
not
a
little
thing
and
i
am
not
funny
i
consider
you
very
impertinent
what
is
position
asked
irving
instantly
sobering
how
do
we
get
it
it
is
born
with
us
answered
iris
dipping
her
flannel
cloth
in
ammonia
and
we
have
to
live
up
to
it
if
we
have
low
tastes
we
lose
it
and
it
never
comes
back
wonder
if
i
have
it
mused
lynn
of
course
iris
assured
him
you
are
a
of
aunt
peace
but
not
so
nearly
related
as
i
because
i
am
her
legal
daughter
i
was
born
of
poor
but
honest
parents
she
went
on
having
evidently
absorbed
the
phrase
from
her
school
reader
so
i
was
respectable
even
at
the
beginning
when
aunt
peace
took
me
i
got
social
position
and
if
i
am
always
a
lady
i
will
keep
it
otherwise
not
the
girl
was
very
lovely
as
she
leaned
back
in
the
quaint
old
chair
to
rest
for
a
moment
she
was
still
regarding
the
candlestick
attentively
and
did
not
look
at
lynn
it
is
strange
to
me
she
said
that
coming
from
the
city
as
you
do
you
should
not
know
about
such
things
here
she
sent
him
the
quickest
possible
glance
from
a
pair
of
inscrutable
eyes
and
he
began
to
wonder
if
she
were
not
merely
amusing
herself
he
was
tempted
to
kiss
her
but
wisely
refrained
iris
called
aunt
peace
from
the
doorway
will
you
wash
the
royal
worcester
plate
and
lynn
it
is
time
you
were
practising
lynn
worked
hard
until
the
bell
rang
for
luncheon
when
he
went
down
he
found
the
others
already
at
the
table
we
did
not
wait
for
you
aunt
peace
explained
because
we
were
in
a
hurry
immediately
after
luncheon
on
wednesdays
i
take
my
nap
i
sleep
from
two
to
three
will
you
please
see
that
the
house
is
quiet
she
spoke
to
margaret
but
she
looked
at
lynn
which
means
said
he
that
those
who
are
studying
the
violin
will
kindly
not
practise
until
after
three
and
that
it
would
be
considered
a
kindness
if
they
would
not
walk
much
in
the
house
their
feet
being
heavy
lynn
said
the
old
lady
irrelevantly
you
are
extremely
intelligent
i
expect
great
things
of
you
that
weekly
hour
of
luxury
was
the
only
relaxation
in
miss
field
busy
happy
life
breakfast
at
seven
and
bed
at
ten
this
was
the
ironclad
rule
of
the
house
ever
since
she
came
to
east
lancaster
iris
had
kept
solemn
guard
over
the
front
door
on
wednesdays
from
two
to
three
rash
visitors
never
reached
the
bell
but
were
met
on
the
doorstep
by
a
little
maid
whose
tiny
finger
rested
upon
her
lip
hush
she
would
say
aunt
peace
is
asleep
interruptions
were
infrequent
however
for
east
lancaster
knew
miss
field
habits
and
respected
them
my
dears
she
said
as
she
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
winding
stairs
i
leave
you
for
a
far
country
where
perhaps
i
shall
meet
some
of
my
old
friends
i
shall
visit
strange
lands
and
have
many
new
experiences
some
of
which
will
doubtless
be
impossible
and
grotesque
i
shall
be
gone
but
one
short
hour
and
when
i
return
i
shall
have
much
to
tell
you
she
dreams
explained
iris
in
a
low
voice
as
the
mistress
of
the
mansion
smiled
back
at
them
over
the
railing
and
when
she
wakes
she
always
tells
me
lynn
went
out
for
a
long
tramp
after
vainly
endeavouring
to
persuade
his
mother
or
iris
to
accompany
him
i
walked
enough
at
night
as
it
is
said
irving
and
the
girl
excused
herself
on
account
of
her
household
duties
he
clattered
down
the
steps
banged
the
gate
and
went
whistling
down
the
path
the
mother
listened
fondly
till
the
cheery
notes
died
away
in
the
distance
bless
his
heart
she
said
to
herself
how
fine
and
strong
he
is
and
how
much
i
love
him
the
house
seemed
to
wait
while
its
guardian
spirit
slept
left
to
herself
margaret
paced
to
and
fro
down
the
long
hall
then
back
through
the
parlour
and
library
and
so
on
restlessly
until
she
reflected
that
she
might
possibly
disturb
aunt
peace
a
robin
in
the
overhanging
boughs
of
the
maple
at
the
gate
was
unsuccessfully
courting
a
disdainful
lady
who
sat
on
the
topmost
twig
and
paid
no
attention
to
him
from
the
distant
orchard
came
the
breath
of
apple
blooms
and
a
single
bluebird
winged
his
solitary
way
across
the
fields
his
colour
gleaming
brightly
for
an
instant
against
the
silvery
clouds
beautiful
as
it
was
margaret
sighed
and
her
face
lost
its
serenity
a
bit
of
verse
sang
itself
through
her
memory
again
and
again
who
wins
his
love
shall
lose
her
who
loses
her
shall
gain
for
still
the
spirit
wooes
her
a
soul
without
a
stain
and
memory
still
pursues
her
with
longings
not
in
vain
in
dreams
she
grows
not
older
the
lands
of
dream
among
though
all
the
world
wax
colder
though
all
the
songs
be
sung
in
dreams
doth
he
behold
her
still
fair
and
kind
and
young
dreams
she
murmured
empty
dreams
while
your
soul
starves
iris
tiptoed
in
with
her
sewing
and
sat
down
margaret
felt
her
presence
in
the
room
but
did
not
turn
away
from
the
window
iris
was
one
of
those
rare
people
with
whom
one
could
be
silent
and
not
feel
that
the
proprieties
had
been
injured
deep
down
in
her
heart
margaret
had
stored
away
all
the
bitterness
of
her
life
that
single
drop
which
is
well
enough
when
left
by
itself
because
it
is
of
a
different
specific
gravity
when
the
cup
is
stirred
the
lees
taint
the
whole
and
it
takes
time
for
the
readjustment
were
it
not
for
the
merciful
readjustment
this
grey
old
world
of
ours
would
be
too
dark
to
live
in
at
length
she
turned
and
looked
at
the
little
seamstress
who
sat
bolt
upright
as
she
had
been
taught
in
the
carved
mahogany
chair
she
noted
the
long
lashes
that
swept
the
tinted
cheek
the
masses
of
hair
over
the
low
white
brow
the
tender
wistfulness
in
the
lines
of
the
mouth
the
dimpled
hands
and
the
rounded
arm
so
evidently
made
for
all
the
sweet
uses
of
love
that
margaret
heart
contracted
in
sudden
pain
iris
she
said
in
a
tone
that
startled
the
girl
when
the
right
man
comes
and
you
know
absolutely
in
your
own
heart
that
he
is
the
right
man
go
with
him
whether
he
be
prince
or
beggar
if
unhappiness
comes
to
you
take
it
bravely
as
a
gentlewoman
should
but
never
for
your
own
sake
allow
yourself
to
regret
your
faith
in
him
if
you
love
him
and
he
loves
you
there
are
no
barriers
between
you
they
are
nothing
but
cobwebs
sweep
them
aside
with
a
single
stroke
of
magnificent
daring
and
go
social
position
counts
for
nothing
other
opinions
count
for
nothing
it
is
between
your
heart
and
his
and
in
that
sanctuary
no
one
else
has
a
right
to
intrude
if
he
has
only
a
crust
to
give
you
share
it
with
him
but
do
not
let
anyone
persuade
you
into
a
lifetime
of
it
is
too
hard
to
bear
the
girl
deep
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
childish
appealing
and
yet
with
evident
understanding
margaret
face
was
full
of
tender
pity
was
this
butterfly
too
destined
to
be
broken
on
the
wheel
iris
felt
the
sudden
passion
of
the
other
saw
traces
of
suffering
in
the
dark
eyes
the
set
lips
and
even
in
the
slender
hands
that
hovered
whitely
over
the
black
gown
thank
you
irving
she
said
quietly
i
understand
the
minutes
ticked
by
and
no
other
word
was
spoken
at
three
precisely
aunt
peace
came
back
she
had
on
her
best
gown
a
soft
heavy
black
silk
simply
made
at
the
neck
and
wrists
were
bits
of
rare
old
lace
and
her
one
jewel
an
emerald
of
great
beauty
and
value
gleamed
at
her
throat
she
wore
no
rings
except
the
worn
band
of
gold
that
had
been
her
mother
wedding
ring
what
did
you
dream
asked
iris
nothing
dearie
she
laughed
i
have
never
slept
so
soundly
before
our
guests
have
put
a
charm
upon
the
house
from
the
embroidered
that
dangled
at
her
side
she
took
out
the
thread
lace
she
was
making
and
began
to
count
her
stitches
i
think
i
get
my
sewing
too
said
margaret
i
feel
like
a
drone
in
this
hive
of
industry
one
two
three
chain
said
aunt
peace
iris
do
you
think
the
cakes
are
as
good
as
they
were
last
time
i
think
they
even
better
did
you
take
out
the
oldest
port
yes
the
very
oldest
i
trust
he
was
not
hurt
aunt
peace
went
on
because
last
week
i
asked
him
not
to
come
the
common
people
sometimes
feel
those
things
more
keenly
than
aristocrats
who
are
accustomed
to
the
disturbance
of
guests
of
course
he
would
be
disappointed
said
iris
with
a
little
smile
but
he
would
understand
i
sure
he
would
when
margaret
came
back
she
had
a
white
fluffy
garment
over
her
arm
who
would
have
thought
she
cried
gaily
that
i
should
ever
have
the
time
to
make
myself
a
petticoat
by
hand
the
atmosphere
of
east
lancaster
has
wrought
a
wondrous
change
in
me
iris
said
miss
field
let
me
see
your
stitches
the
girl
held
up
her
petticoat
a
dainty
garment
of
finest
cambric
and
exquisitely
made
and
the
old
lady
examined
it
critically
it
is
not
what
i
could
do
at
your
age
she
continued
but
it
will
answer
very
well
lynn
came
in
noisily
remembering
only
at
the
threshold
that
one
did
not
whistle
in
east
lancaster
houses
i
had
a
fine
tramp
he
said
all
over
west
lancaster
and
through
the
woods
on
both
sides
of
it
i
had
some
flowers
for
all
of
you
but
i
laid
them
down
on
a
stone
and
forgot
to
go
back
after
them
aunt
peace
you
looking
fine
since
you
had
your
nap
still
working
at
that
petticoat
mother
we
all
making
petticoats
answered
margaret
even
aunt
peace
is
knitting
lace
for
one
and
iris
has
hers
almost
done
let
me
see
it
said
lynn
he
reached
over
and
took
it
out
of
the
girl
lap
while
she
was
threading
her
needle
much
to
his
surprise
it
was
immediately
snatched
away
from
him
iris
paused
only
long
enough
to
administer
a
sounding
box
to
the
offender
ear
then
marched
out
of
the
room
with
her
head
high
and
her
work
under
her
arm
well
of
all
things
said
lynn
ruefully
why
would
she
let
me
look
at
her
petticoat
because
answered
aunt
peace
severely
iris
has
been
brought
up
like
a
lady
gentlemen
did
not
expect
to
see
ladies
petticoats
when
i
was
young
oh
said
lynn
i
see
his
mouth
twitched
and
he
glanced
sideways
at
his
mother
she
was
bending
over
her
work
and
her
lips
did
not
move
but
he
could
see
that
her
eyes
smiled
at
exactly
seven
the
expected
guest
was
ushered
into
the
parlour
good
evening
doctor
said
miss
field
in
her
stately
way
i
assure
you
this
is
quite
a
pleasure
she
presented
him
to
irving
and
lynn
and
motioned
him
to
an
he
was
tall
straight
and
seventy
almost
painfully
neat
and
evidently
a
gentleman
of
the
old
school
i
trust
you
are
well
madam
i
am
always
well
returned
aunt
peace
if
all
the
other
old
ladies
in
east
lancaster
were
as
well
as
i
you
would
soon
be
obliged
to
take
down
your
sign
and
seek
another
location
the
others
took
but
small
part
in
the
conversation
which
was
never
lively
and
which
indeed
might
have
been
stilted
by
the
presence
of
strangers
it
was
the
commonplace
talk
of
little
things
which
distinguishes
the
country
town
and
it
lasted
for
half
an
hour
as
the
clock
chimed
eight
miss
field
smiled
at
him
significantly
shall
we
play
chess
she
asked
if
the
others
will
excuse
us
i
shall
be
charmed
he
responded
soon
they
were
deep
in
their
game
margaret
went
after
a
book
she
had
been
reading
and
the
young
people
went
to
the
library
where
they
could
talk
undisturbed
they
played
three
games
miss
field
won
the
first
and
third
her
antagonist
contenting
himself
with
the
second
it
had
always
been
so
and
for
ten
years
she
had
taken
a
childish
delight
in
her
skill
my
dear
doctor
she
often
said
it
takes
a
woman
of
brains
to
play
chess
it
does
indeed
he
invariably
answered
with
an
air
of
gallantry
once
he
had
been
indiscreet
and
had
won
all
three
games
but
that
was
in
the
beginning
and
it
had
never
happened
since
when
the
clock
struck
ten
he
looked
at
his
heavy
silver
watch
with
apparent
surprise
i
had
no
idea
it
was
so
late
he
said
i
must
be
going
pray
wait
a
moment
doctor
let
me
offer
you
some
refreshment
before
you
begin
that
long
walk
iris
yes
aunt
peace
the
girl
knew
very
well
what
was
expected
of
her
and
dimples
came
and
went
around
the
corners
of
her
mouth
those
little
cakes
that
we
had
for
tea
perhaps
there
may
be
one
or
two
left
and
is
there
not
a
little
wine
i
see
smiling
at
the
pretty
comedy
she
went
out
into
the
kitchen
where
doctor
brinkerhoff
favourite
cakes
freshly
made
had
been
carefully
put
away
only
one
of
them
had
been
touched
and
that
merely
to
make
sure
of
the
quality
with
the
royal
worcester
plate
generously
piled
with
cakes
a
tray
of
glasses
and
a
decanter
of
miss
field
famous
port
she
went
back
into
the
parlour
this
is
very
charming
said
the
doctor
he
had
made
the
same
speech
once
a
week
for
ten
years
aunt
peace
filled
the
glasses
and
when
all
had
been
served
she
looked
at
him
with
a
rare
smile
upon
her
beautiful
old
face
then
the
brim
of
his
glass
touched
hers
with
the
clear
ring
of
crystal
to
your
good
health
madam
and
to
your
prosperity
she
returned
the
old
toast
still
served
and
now
my
dear
miss
iris
he
said
may
we
not
hope
for
a
song
which
one
laurie
if
you
please
she
sang
the
old
ballad
with
a
wealth
of
feeling
in
her
deep
voice
and
even
lynn
who
was
listening
critically
was
forced
to
admit
that
she
did
it
well
at
eleven
the
guest
went
away
his
hostess
cordially
inviting
him
to
come
again
what
a
charming
man
said
margaret
an
old
brick
added
lynn
with
more
force
than
elegance
yes
replied
aunt
peace
concealing
a
yawn
behind
her
fan
it
is
a
thousand
pities
that
he
has
no
social
position
v
the
light
of
dreams
how
do
you
get
on
with
the
master
asked
iris
after
a
fashion
answered
irving
but
i
do
not
get
on
with
fräulein
fredrika
at
all
she
despises
me
she
does
not
like
many
people
so
it
would
seem
i
have
been
unfortunate
from
the
first
though
i
was
careful
to
admire
crazy
jug
it
is
the
apple
of
her
eye
laughed
iris
it
means
to
her
just
what
his
cremona
means
to
him
it
is
a
wonderful
creation
and
i
told
her
so
but
where
in
the
dickens
did
she
get
the
idea
do
ask
me
did
you
happen
to
notice
anything
else
no
only
the
violin
sometimes
i
take
my
lesson
in
the
parlour
sometimes
in
the
shop
downstairs
or
even
in
herr
kaufmann
bedroom
which
opens
off
of
it
when
i
come
he
stops
whatever
he
happens
to
be
doing
sits
down
and
proceeds
with
my
education
on
the
floor
said
iris
reminiscently
she
has
a
gold
jar
which
contains
cat
tails
and
grasses
it
is
herr
kaufmann
silk
hat
which
he
used
to
have
when
he
played
in
the
famous
orchestra
with
the
brim
cut
off
and
plenty
of
gold
paint
put
on
the
gilded
with
blue
roses
on
it
which
swings
from
the
hanging
lamp
was
done
by
your
humble
servant
she
has
loved
me
ever
since
iris
exclaimed
lynn
reproachfully
how
could
you
how
could
i
what
paint
anything
so
outrageous
as
that
my
dear
boy
said
miss
temple
patronisingly
with
her
pretty
head
a
little
to
one
side
you
are
young
in
the
ways
of
the
world
i
was
not
achieving
a
work
of
art
i
was
merely
giving
pleasure
to
the
fräulein
much
trouble
would
be
saved
if
people
who
undertake
to
give
pleasure
would
consult
the
wishes
of
the
recipient
in
preference
to
their
own
tastes
differ
as
even
you
may
have
observed
personally
i
have
no
use
for
a
gilded
i
could
even
live
in
the
same
house
with
one
but
i
was
pleasing
her
not
myself
i
wonder
what
i
could
do
that
would
please
her
said
lynn
half
to
himself
make
her
something
out
of
nothing
suggested
iris
she
would
like
that
better
than
anything
else
she
has
a
wall
basket
made
of
a
fish
broiler
a
chair
that
was
once
a
barrel
a
dresser
which
has
been
evolved
from
a
packing
box
a
sofa
that
was
primarily
a
cot
and
a
match
box
made
from
a
tin
cup
covered
with
silk
and
gilded
on
the
inside
not
to
mention
heaps
of
other
things
then
what
is
left
for
me
the
desirable
things
seem
to
have
been
used
up
wait
said
iris
and
i
show
you
she
ran
off
gaily
humming
a
little
song
under
her
breath
and
came
back
presently
with
a
a
sheet
of
tissue
paper
an
old
black
ostrich
feather
and
her
paints
what
in
the
world
began
lynn
do
be
impatient
please
make
the
gold
with
a
black
head
and
then
i
show
you
what
to
do
next
are
you
going
to
help
me
only
with
my
valuable
advice
it
is
your
gift
you
know
awkwardly
lynn
gilded
the
and
suspended
it
from
the
back
of
a
chair
to
dry
i
hope
she
like
it
he
said
she
pointed
to
me
once
and
said
something
in
german
to
her
brother
i
did
understand
but
i
remembered
the
words
and
when
i
got
home
i
looked
them
up
in
my
dictionary
as
nearly
as
i
could
get
it
she
had
characterised
me
as
big
lumbering
calf
discerning
woman
commented
iris
now
take
this
sheet
of
tissue
paper
and
squeeze
it
up
into
a
little
ball
then
straighten
it
out
and
do
it
again
when
it
all
soft
and
crinkly
i
tell
you
what
to
do
next
there
exclaimed
lynn
finally
if
it
squeezed
up
any
more
it
will
break
now
paint
the
head
of
the
and
make
some
straight
black
lines
on
the
middle
of
it
cross
ways
will
you
please
tell
me
what
i
making
wait
and
see
obeying
instructions
he
fastened
the
paper
tightly
in
the
fork
of
the
and
spread
it
out
on
either
side
the
corners
were
cut
and
pulled
into
the
semblance
of
wings
and
black
circles
were
painted
here
and
there
iris
herself
added
the
finishing
touch
two
bits
of
the
ostrich
feather
glued
to
the
top
of
the
head
for
antennæ
oh
cried
lynn
in
pleased
surprise
a
butterfly
how
hideous
said
margaret
pausing
in
the
doorway
i
trust
it
not
meant
for
me
it
for
the
fräulein
answered
iris
gathering
up
her
paints
and
sweeping
aside
the
litter
lynn
has
made
it
all
by
himself
i
wonder
how
he
stands
it
mused
irving
critically
inspecting
the
butterfly
i
asked
him
once
said
iris
if
he
liked
all
the
queer
things
in
his
house
and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
good
is
mine
art
to
me
he
asked
it
makes
me
so
i
can
not
live
with
mine
sister
fredrika
likes
the
gay
colours
such
as
one
sees
in
the
fields
but
they
hurt
mine
eyes
still
because
the
tidies
and
the
crazy
jug
swear
to
me
it
is
no
reason
for
me
to
hurt
mine
sister
feelings
we
have
a
large
house
fredrika
has
the
upstairs
and
i
have
the
downstairs
when
i
can
no
longer
stand
the
bright
lights
i
can
turn
mine
back
and
look
out
of
the
window
or
i
can
go
down
in
the
shop
with
mine
violins
down
there
i
see
no
colours
and
i
can
put
mine
feet
on
all
chairs
lynn
laughed
but
margaret
who
was
listening
intently
only
smiled
sadly
that
afternoon
when
the
boy
went
up
the
hill
with
the
butterfly
dangling
from
his
hand
by
a
string
he
was
greeted
with
childish
cries
of
delight
on
either
side
hoping
for
equal
success
at
the
master
he
rang
the
bell
and
the
fräulein
came
to
the
door
when
she
saw
who
it
was
her
face
instantly
became
hard
and
forbidding
mine
brudder
is
not
home
she
said
frostily
i
know
answered
lynn
with
a
winning
smile
but
i
came
to
see
you
see
i
made
this
for
you
wonder
and
delight
were
in
her
eyes
as
she
took
it
from
his
outstretched
hand
for
me
yes
all
for
you
i
made
it
you
make
this
for
me
by
yourself
alone
no
miss
temple
helped
me
miss
temple
repeated
the
fräulein
she
is
most
kind
and
you
likewise
she
hastened
to
add
it
will
be
of
a
niceness
if
miss
temple
and
you
shall
come
to
mine
house
to
tea
evening
i
ask
her
he
returned
and
thank
you
very
much
thus
lynn
made
his
peace
with
fräulein
fredrika
laughing
like
two
irresponsible
children
they
went
up
the
hill
together
at
the
appointed
time
lynn
arms
were
full
of
wild
blooms
which
he
had
taken
a
long
walk
to
find
and
iris
had
two
little
pots
of
preserves
as
her
contribution
to
the
feast
their
host
and
hostess
were
waiting
for
them
at
the
door
fräulein
fredrika
was
very
elegant
in
her
best
gown
and
her
sharp
eyes
were
kind
the
master
was
clad
in
rusty
black
which
bore
marks
of
frequent
sponging
and
occasional
pressing
it
is
most
kind
he
said
bowing
gallantly
to
iris
and
you
young
man
i
am
glad
to
see
you
as
always
iris
found
a
stone
jar
for
the
apple
blossoms
and
brought
them
in
the
master
fine
old
face
beamed
as
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
pink
and
white
sweetness
it
is
like
magic
he
said
i
think
inside
of
every
tree
there
must
be
some
beautiful
young
lady
such
as
we
read
about
in
the
old
books
a
young
lady
something
like
miss
iris
all
winter
when
it
is
cold
she
sleeps
in
her
soft
bed
made
from
the
silk
lining
of
the
bark
then
one
day
the
sun
shines
warm
and
the
robin
sings
to
her
and
wakes
her
says
she
it
so
soon
spring
i
must
get
to
work
right
away
at
mine
apple
blossoms
then
she
stoops
down
for
some
sand
and
some
dirt
in
her
hands
she
moulds
it
so
reaching
out
for
some
rain
to
keep
it
together
then
she
says
one
charm
with
a
forked
stick
she
packs
it
into
every
little
place
inside
that
apple
tree
and
sprinkles
some
more
of
it
over
the
outside
says
she
must
wait
for
i
have
done
mine
work
well
it
is
for
the
sun
and
the
wind
and
the
rain
to
finish
so
the
rain
makes
all
very
wet
and
the
wind
blows
and
the
sun
shines
and
presently
the
sand
and
dirt
that
she
has
put
in
is
changed
to
sap
that
is
so
glad
it
runs
like
one
squirrel
all
over
the
inside
of
the
tree
and
tries
to
sing
like
one
bird
says
this
young
lady
is
as
i
thought
then
she
says
one
more
charm
and
when
the
sun
comes
up
in
the
morning
it
sees
that
the
branches
are
all
covered
with
buds
and
leaves
the
young
lady
and
the
moon
work
one
little
while
at
it
in
the
evening
and
the
next
morning
there
is
this
the
master
buried
his
face
in
the
fragrant
blooms
it
is
a
most
wonderful
sweetness
he
went
on
it
is
wind
and
grass
and
sun
and
the
souls
of
all
the
apple
blossoms
that
are
dead
franz
called
fräulein
fredrika
you
will
bring
them
out
to
tea
yes
as
the
entertainment
progressed
lynn
admiration
of
iris
increased
she
seemed
equally
at
home
in
miss
field
stately
mansion
and
in
the
tiny
on
the
brink
of
a
precipice
where
everything
appeared
to
be
made
out
of
something
else
she
was
in
high
spirits
and
kept
them
all
laughing
yet
in
spite
of
her
merry
chatter
there
was
an
undertone
of
tender
wistfulness
that
set
his
heart
to
beating
the
master
too
was
at
his
best
usually
he
was
reserved
and
quiet
but
the
barriers
were
down
he
told
them
stories
of
his
student
days
in
germany
wonderful
adventures
by
land
and
sea
and
conjured
up
glimpses
of
the
kings
and
queens
of
the
old
world
life
he
sighed
is
very
strange
one
begins
within
an
hour
walk
of
the
imperial
palace
where
sometimes
one
may
see
the
kaiser
and
the
kaiserin
and
one
ends
here
wherever
one
may
be
that
is
the
best
place
said
the
fräulein
the
dear
god
knows
yet
sometimes
i
too
must
think
of
mine
germany
and
wish
for
it
fredrika
cried
the
master
are
you
not
happy
here
indeed
yes
franz
always
her
harsh
voice
was
softened
and
her
piercing
eyes
were
misty
one
saw
that
however
carefully
hidden
there
was
great
love
between
these
two
iris
helped
the
fräulein
with
the
dishes
in
spite
of
her
protests
one
does
not
ask
one
guests
to
help
with
the
work
she
said
but
just
suppose
answered
iris
laughing
that
one
guests
have
washed
dishes
hundreds
of
times
at
home
in
the
parlour
meanwhile
the
master
talked
to
lynn
he
told
him
of
great
violinists
he
had
heard
and
of
famous
old
violins
he
had
seen
but
there
was
never
a
word
about
the
cremona
mine
friend
the
doctor
said
the
master
do
you
perchance
know
him
yes
answered
lynn
i
have
that
pleasure
he
all
right
is
he
so
he
thinks
returned
the
master
missing
the
point
of
the
phrase
in
an
argument
one
can
never
convince
him
he
thinks
it
is
for
me
to
go
out
on
one
grand
tour
and
give
many
concerts
and
secure
much
fame
but
why
should
i
go
i
ask
him
when
i
am
happy
here
so
many
people
know
what
should
make
one
happy
a
thousand
times
better
than
the
happy
one
knows
life
he
said
again
is
very
strange
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
spoke
again
i
have
had
mine
fame
he
said
i
have
played
to
great
houses
both
here
and
abroad
and
women
have
thrown
red
roses
at
me
and
mine
violin
there
has
been
much
in
the
papers
and
i
have
had
many
large
sums
which
of
course
i
have
always
given
to
the
poor
one
should
use
one
art
to
do
good
with
and
not
to
become
rich
i
have
mine
house
mine
clothes
all
that
is
good
for
me
to
eat
mine
sister
and
mine
he
hesitated
for
an
instant
and
lynn
knew
he
was
thinking
of
the
cremona
mine
violins
he
concluded
mine
little
shop
where
i
make
them
and
best
of
all
mine
dreams
iris
came
back
and
fräulein
fredrika
followed
her
if
you
will
give
me
all
the
little
shells
she
was
saying
i
will
stick
them
together
with
glue
and
make
mineself
one
little
house
to
sit
on
the
parlour
table
it
will
be
most
kind
her
voice
was
caressing
and
her
face
fairly
shone
with
joy
i
will
light
the
lamp
she
went
on
it
is
dark
here
now
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
she
pulled
down
the
lamp
that
hung
by
heavy
chains
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
the
gilded
swung
back
and
forth
violently
no
no
fredrika
said
the
master
it
is
not
a
necessity
to
light
the
lamp
herr
irving
she
began
would
you
not
like
the
lamp
to
see
by
not
at
all
answered
lynn
i
like
the
twilight
best
come
fräulein
said
iris
sit
over
here
by
me
did
i
tell
you
how
you
could
make
a
little
out
of
braided
rope
and
a
bit
of
blue
ribbon
no
returned
the
fräulein
excitedly
you
did
not
it
will
be
most
kind
if
you
will
do
it
now
the
women
talked
in
low
tones
and
the
others
were
silent
without
listening
the
street
was
in
shadow
and
here
and
there
lanterns
flashed
in
the
dark
down
in
the
valley
velvety
night
was
laid
over
the
river
and
the
willows
that
grew
along
its
margin
but
the
last
light
lingered
on
the
blue
hills
above
and
a
single
star
had
set
its
exquisite
lamp
to
gleaming
against
the
afterglow
the
wings
of
darkness
hovered
over
the
little
house
and
yet
no
word
was
spoken
it
was
an
intimate
hush
such
as
sometimes
falls
between
lovers
who
have
no
need
of
speech
lynn
and
iris
looked
forward
to
the
future
with
the
limitless
hope
of
youth
while
the
others
brooded
over
a
past
which
had
brought
each
of
them
a
generous
measure
of
joy
and
pain
the
full
moon
came
out
from
behind
the
clouds
and
flooded
the
valley
with
silver
light
oh
cried
iris
how
glorious
it
is
yes
said
the
master
it
is
the
light
of
dreams
all
the
ugliness
is
hidden
as
in
life
when
one
can
dream
only
the
beauty
is
left
wait
i
will
play
it
to
you
he
went
downstairs
for
his
violin
and
lynn
moved
closer
to
iris
fräulein
fredrika
retreated
into
the
shadow
at
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
presently
the
master
returned
snapping
and
tightening
the
strings
it
was
not
the
cremona
but
the
other
he
sat
down
by
the
window
and
the
moonlight
touched
his
face
caressingly
he
was
grey
with
his
fifty
years
and
more
but
as
he
sat
there
his
massive
head
thrown
back
and
his
hair
silvered
he
seemed
very
near
to
the
gates
of
youth
in
a
moment
he
was
lost
to
his
surroundings
he
tapped
the
bow
on
the
sill
as
an
orchestra
leader
taps
for
attention
straightened
himself
smiled
and
began
it
was
a
rippling
laughing
melody
played
on
muted
strings
full
of
unexpected
harmonies
and
quaintly
phrased
in
a
moment
they
caught
the
witchery
of
it
and
the
meaning
it
was
titania
and
her
fairies
suddenly
transported
around
the
world
mystery
and
magic
were
in
the
theme
moonbeams
shimmered
through
it
elves
played
here
and
there
and
shining
waters
sang
through
summer
silences
all
at
once
there
was
a
pause
then
sonorous
deep
and
splendid
came
another
harmony
which
in
impassioned
beauty
voiced
the
ministry
of
pain
as
before
lynn
saw
chiefly
the
technique
never
for
a
moment
did
he
forget
the
instrument
iris
was
trembling
for
she
well
knew
those
high
and
lonely
places
of
the
spirit
within
the
borders
of
gethsemane
the
master
put
down
the
violin
and
sighed
come
faltered
iris
it
is
late
and
we
must
go
he
did
not
hear
and
it
was
fräulein
fredrika
who
went
to
the
door
with
them
franz
is
thinking
she
whispered
he
is
often
like
that
he
will
be
most
sorry
when
he
learns
that
you
have
gone
this
way
said
iris
when
they
reached
the
street
they
went
to
the
brow
of
the
cliff
and
looked
once
more
across
the
shadowed
valley
to
the
luminous
ranges
of
the
everlasting
hills
she
turned
away
at
last
thrilled
to
the
depths
of
her
soul
come
she
whispered
we
must
go
back
they
walked
softly
as
though
they
feared
to
disturb
someone
in
the
little
house
but
there
was
no
sound
from
within
nor
any
light
save
at
the
window
where
the
light
of
dreams
streamed
over
the
master
face
and
made
it
young
vi
a
letter
roses
rioted
through
east
lancaster
and
made
the
gardens
glorious
with
bloom
the
year
was
at
its
bridal
and
every
chalice
was
filled
with
fragrant
incense
bees
powdered
with
pollen
hummed
slowly
back
and
forth
and
the
soft
whir
of
unnumbered
gossamer
wings
came
in
drowsy
melody
from
the
distant
clover
fields
june
sang
iris
to
herself
june
oh
june
sweet
june
she
was
getting
ready
for
her
daily
trip
to
the
once
in
a
great
while
there
would
be
a
letter
there
for
aunt
peace
or
irving
lynn
also
had
an
intermittent
correspondent
or
two
but
the
errand
usually
proved
fruitless
still
since
irving
letter
had
lain
nearly
two
weeks
in
miss
field
box
uncalled
for
it
had
been
a
point
of
honour
with
iris
to
see
that
such
a
thing
did
not
happen
again
books
and
papers
were
supplied
in
abundance
by
the
local
circulating
library
and
the
high
bookcases
at
miss
field
were
well
filled
with
standard
literature
iris
read
everything
she
could
lay
her
hands
upon
mere
print
exercised
a
certain
fascination
over
her
mind
and
she
had
conscientiously
finished
every
book
that
she
had
begun
those
early
years
after
all
are
the
most
important
the
old
books
are
the
best
and
how
few
of
us
have
the
time
to
read
them
ten
years
of
browsing
in
a
well
equipped
library
will
do
much
for
anyone
and
iris
had
made
the
most
of
her
opportunities
this
girl
of
twenty
hemmed
about
by
the
narrow
standards
of
east
lancaster
had
a
broad
outlook
upon
life
a
large
view
that
would
have
done
credit
to
a
woman
of
twice
her
age
from
the
beginning
the
people
of
the
books
had
been
real
to
her
and
she
had
filled
the
old
house
with
the
fairy
figures
of
romance
of
the
things
that
make
for
happiness
the
love
of
books
comes
first
no
matter
how
the
world
may
have
used
us
sure
solace
lies
there
the
weary
toilsome
day
drags
to
its
disheartening
close
and
both
love
and
friendship
have
proved
powerless
to
appreciate
or
understand
but
in
the
quiet
corner
consolation
can
always
be
found
a
single
shelf
perhaps
suffices
for
one
few
treasures
but
who
shall
say
it
is
not
enough
a
book
unlike
any
other
friend
will
wait
not
only
upon
the
hour
but
upon
the
mood
it
asks
nothing
and
gives
much
when
one
comes
in
the
right
way
the
volumes
stand
in
serried
ranks
at
attention
listening
eagerly
one
may
fancy
for
the
command
is
your
world
a
small
one
made
unendurable
by
a
thousand
petty
cares
are
the
heart
and
soul
of
you
cast
down
by
bitter
disappointment
would
you
leave
it
all
if
only
for
an
hour
and
come
back
with
a
new
point
of
view
then
open
the
covers
of
a
book
with
this
gentle
comrade
you
may
journey
to
the
very
end
of
the
world
and
even
to
the
beginning
of
civilisation
there
is
no
land
which
you
may
not
visit
from
arctic
snows
to
the
loftiest
peaks
of
southern
mountains
gallant
gentlemen
will
go
with
you
and
tell
you
how
to
appreciate
what
you
see
further
still
there
are
excursions
into
the
boundless
regions
of
imagination
where
the
light
of
dreams
has
laid
its
surpassing
beauty
over
all
would
you
wander
in
company
with
soldiers
of
fortune
and
share
their
wonderful
adventures
would
you
live
in
the
time
of
the
crusades
and
undertake
a
pilgrimage
in
the
name
of
the
cross
would
you
smell
the
smoke
of
battle
hear
the
ring
of
steel
the
rattle
of
musketry
and
see
the
colours
break
into
deathly
beauty
well
in
advance
of
the
charge
would
you
have
for
your
friends
a
great
company
of
noble
men
and
women
who
have
wrought
and
suffered
and
triumphed
in
the
end
would
you
find
new
courage
stronger
faith
and
serene
hope
then
open
the
covers
of
a
book
and
presto
change
iris
called
aunt
peace
you
surely
not
going
without
your
hat
of
course
not
the
colour
that
came
and
went
in
her
damask
cheeks
was
very
like
that
in
her
pink
dimity
gown
she
put
on
her
white
hat
the
brim
drooping
beneath
its
burden
of
pink
roses
and
drew
her
gloves
reluctantly
over
her
dimpled
hands
iris
dear
your
sunshade
yes
aunt
peace
she
came
back
a
little
unwillingly
but
tan
was
a
personal
disgrace
in
east
lancaster
ready
at
last
she
tripped
down
the
path
and
closed
the
gate
carefully
irving
waved
a
friendly
hand
at
her
from
the
upper
window
bring
me
a
letter
she
called
i
try
to
answered
iris
but
i
ca
promise
she
lifted
her
gown
a
little
to
keep
it
clear
of
burr
and
brier
and
one
saw
the
smooth
black
silk
stocking
chastely
embroidered
at
the
ankle
as
one
suspected
by
the
hand
of
the
wearer
and
the
dainty
shoes
the
sunshade
waved
back
and
forth
coquettishly
it
seemed
to
be
an
airy
ornament
rather
than
an
article
of
utility
down
the
street
she
met
doctor
brinkerhoff
good
morning
little
lady
he
said
with
a
smile
good
morning
sir
replied
iris
with
a
quaint
courtesy
i
trust
you
are
well
my
health
is
uniformly
good
he
returned
primly
you
must
remember
that
i
have
my
own
drugs
and
potions
always
at
hand
he
made
careful
inquiries
as
to
the
physical
and
mental
of
each
member
of
the
family
sent
kindly
salutations
to
all
made
a
low
bow
to
iris
and
went
on
a
very
pleasant
gentleman
she
said
to
herself
what
a
pity
that
he
has
no
social
position
she
loitered
at
the
bridge
hanging
over
the
railing
and
looked
down
into
the
sunny
depths
of
the
little
stream
all
through
the
sweet
summer
the
brook
sang
cheerily
by
night
and
by
day
it
began
in
a
cool
crystal
pool
far
up
among
the
hills
and
wandered
over
mossy
reaches
and
pebbly
ways
singing
meanwhile
of
all
the
fragrant
woodland
through
which
it
came
hidden
springs
in
subterranean
caverns
caught
by
the
laughing
melody
went
out
to
meet
it
and
then
followed
as
the
children
followed
the
pied
piper
of
old
great
with
its
gathered
waters
it
still
sang
as
it
rippled
onward
to
its
destiny
dreaming
perchance
of
the
time
when
its
liquid
music
lost
at
last
should
be
merged
into
the
vast
symphony
of
the
sea
lynn
came
down
the
hill
swinging
his
violin
case
and
iris
a
little
consciously
went
on
to
the
standing
on
tiptoe
she
peered
into
the
letter
box
and
then
her
heart
gave
a
little
leap
for
there
were
two
yes
three
letters
there
wait
a
moment
called
the
grizzled
veteran
who
served
as
postmaster
i
finally
got
something
fer
ye
here
miss
peace
field
margaret
irving
and
miss
iris
temple
whispered
iris
in
awe
a
letter
for
me
fer
nobody
else
i
reckon
laughed
the
old
man
anyhow
got
your
name
on
it
she
went
out
half
dazed
in
all
her
life
she
had
had
but
three
letters
two
from
her
mother
which
she
still
kept
and
one
from
santa
claus
the
good
saint
had
left
his
communication
in
the
little
maid
stocking
one
christmas
eve
and
it
was
more
than
a
year
before
iris
observed
that
aunt
peace
and
santa
claus
wrote
precisely
the
same
hand
for
me
she
said
to
herself
all
for
me
it
never
entered
her
pretty
head
to
open
it
the
handwriting
was
unfamiliar
and
the
was
blurred
but
it
seemed
to
have
come
from
the
next
town
the
whole
thing
was
very
disturbing
but
aunt
peace
would
know
then
iris
stopped
suddenly
in
the
path
it
might
be
wicked
but
after
all
why
should
aunt
peace
know
why
not
have
just
one
little
secret
all
to
herself
the
daring
of
it
almost
took
her
breath
away
but
in
that
single
dramatic
instant
she
decided
no
one
was
in
sight
and
iris
in
the
shadow
of
a
maple
tucked
the
letter
safely
away
in
her
stocking
fancying
she
heard
it
rustle
as
she
walked
in
her
brief
experience
of
life
there
had
seldom
been
so
long
a
day
the
hours
stretched
on
interminably
and
she
was
never
alone
she
did
not
forget
the
letter
for
a
moment
and
when
she
had
once
become
accustomed
to
the
wonder
of
it
she
was
conscious
of
a
growing
very
feminine
curiosity
a
little
after
ten
when
she
had
dutifully
kissed
aunt
peace
good
night
she
stood
alone
in
her
room
with
her
heart
wildly
beating
the
door
was
locked
and
there
was
not
even
the
sound
of
a
footstep
surely
she
might
read
it
now
by
the
flickering
light
of
her
candle
she
cut
it
at
the
end
with
the
scissors
drew
out
the
letter
and
unfolded
it
with
trembling
hands
iris
daughter
of
the
marshes
it
began
how
shall
i
tell
you
of
your
loveliness
you
are
straight
and
slender
as
the
rushes
dainty
as
a
moonbeam
and
sweet
as
a
rose
of
june
your
dimpled
hands
make
me
think
of
white
flowers
and
the
flush
on
your
cheeks
is
like
that
on
the
petals
of
the
first
anemone
midnight
itself
sleeps
in
your
hair
fragrant
as
the
summer
dusk
and
your
laughing
lips
have
the
colour
of
a
scarlet
geranium
but
your
eyes
my
dear
one
how
shall
i
write
to
you
of
your
eyes
they
have
the
beauty
of
calm
wide
waters
when
sunset
has
given
them
that
wonderful
blue
they
are
eyes
a
man
might
look
into
during
his
last
hour
in
the
world
and
think
his
whole
life
well
spent
because
of
them
do
you
think
me
bold
your
unknown
lover
i
am
bold
because
my
heart
makes
me
so
and
because
there
is
no
other
way
i
dare
not
ask
for
an
answer
nor
tell
you
my
name
but
if
you
are
displeased
i
am
sure
i
have
a
way
of
finding
it
out
perhaps
you
wonder
where
i
have
seen
you
so
i
will
tell
you
this
i
have
seen
you
more
than
once
going
to
the
in
east
lancaster
and
no
matter
how
i
have
learned
your
name
some
day
perhaps
i
shall
see
you
face
to
face
some
day
you
may
give
me
your
gracious
permission
to
tell
you
all
that
is
in
my
heart
until
then
remember
that
i
am
your
knight
that
you
are
my
lady
and
that
i
love
you
iris
love
you
her
eyes
were
as
luminous
as
the
stars
that
shone
upon
the
breast
of
night
if
the
heavens
had
suddenly
opened
she
could
not
have
been
more
surprised
her
first
love
letter
at
a
single
bound
she
had
gained
her
place
beside
those
fair
ladies
of
romance
who
peopled
her
maiden
dreams
from
she
stood
apart
no
longer
a
child
but
a
woman
worshipped
afar
by
some
gallant
lover
who
feared
to
sign
his
name
she
put
out
the
candle
for
the
moonlight
filled
the
room
and
pattered
across
the
polished
floor
in
her
bare
feet
to
her
little
white
bed
the
letter
in
her
hand
rose
bloom
fell
on
her
hands
together
prest
and
on
her
silver
cross
soft
amethyst
the
hours
went
by
and
still
iris
was
awake
the
mute
paper
crushed
close
against
her
breast
i
wonder
she
murmured
her
crimson
face
hidden
in
the
pillow
i
wonder
who
he
can
be
vii
friends
the
doctor
modest
establishment
consisted
of
two
rooms
over
the
here
his
shingle
swung
idly
in
the
summer
breeze
or
resisted
the
onslaughts
of
the
winter
storms
the
infrequent
patient
seldom
met
anyone
else
in
the
office
but
in
case
there
should
be
two
at
once
a
dusty
chair
had
been
placed
in
the
hall
both
rooms
were
kept
scrupulously
clean
by
the
wife
of
the
postmaster
who
lived
on
the
same
floor
but
the
bottles
ranged
in
orderly
rows
upon
the
shelves
were
left
severely
alone
because
the
ministering
influence
lived
in
hourly
dread
of
poison
here
the
family
physician
of
east
lancaster
lived
out
his
monotonous
existence
when
he
had
first
taken
up
his
abode
there
he
had
set
up
his
household
gods
upon
the
hill
in
company
with
his
countrymen
he
soon
found
however
that
his
practice
was
confined
to
the
hill
and
that
for
all
he
might
know
to
the
contrary
east
lancaster
was
unaware
of
his
existence
it
was
the
postmaster
who
first
set
him
right
if
you
out
to
heal
them
as
has
the
money
to
pay
for
it
he
had
said
you
have
to
move
this
yere
brook
what
seems
so
is
the
chalk
mark
that
partitions
the
sheep
off
from
the
goats
you
find
it
so
in
every
place
sometimes
it
water
sometimes
it
a
car
track
and
sometimes
a
deepo
but
it
always
there
though
more
likely
there
ai
no
real
line
exceptin
the
one
what
drawn
in
folks
fool
heads
i
reckon
bein
as
you
a
doctor
you
familiar
with
that
line
down
the
middle
of
human
brains
well
this
yere
brook
is
practically
the
same
thing
considerin
east
and
west
lancaster
for
a
minute
as
brains
the
which
is
a
high
compliment
to
both
so
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
the
doctor
had
cast
in
his
fortunes
with
the
quality
east
lancaster
affected
refined
astonishment
at
first
but
when
the
resident
physician
who
had
long
enjoyed
the
deep
respect
of
the
community
had
been
gathered
to
his
fathers
doctor
brinkerhoff
became
the
last
resort
his
skill
was
universally
admitted
but
no
one
went
to
his
office
for
fear
of
meeting
undesirable
strangers
it
was
thought
to
be
in
better
taste
to
pay
the
double
fee
and
have
the
doctor
call
even
for
such
slight
ailments
as
boils
and
cut
fingers
the
man
was
mentally
broad
enough
to
be
amused
at
the
eccentricities
of
east
lancaster
though
his
keen
old
eyes
did
not
fail
to
discern
that
he
was
merely
tolerated
where
he
had
hoped
to
find
friends
within
the
narrow
confines
of
his
establishment
he
cultivated
a
serene
and
comfortable
philosophy
to
suit
himself
to
his
environment
when
that
environment
was
out
of
his
power
to
change
to
seek
for
the
good
in
everything
and
resolutely
refuse
to
be
affected
by
the
bad
to
believe
steadfastly
in
the
law
of
compensation
this
was
doctor
creed
on
wednesday
and
saturday
evenings
he
was
received
as
an
equal
by
two
of
the
aristocratic
families
on
sunday
mornings
he
never
failed
to
attend
church
before
the
last
notes
of
the
bell
died
away
he
was
always
in
his
place
after
the
service
he
hurried
away
making
courtly
acknowledgments
on
every
side
to
the
formal
greetings
sunday
afternoons
precisely
at
four
he
went
up
the
hill
to
herr
kaufmann
and
spent
the
evening
this
weekly
visit
was
the
leaven
of
fräulein
fredrika
humdrum
life
there
was
a
sort
of
romance
about
it
which
glorified
the
commonplace
and
she
looked
forward
to
it
with
repressed
excitement
poor
fräulein
fredrika
perhaps
she
too
had
her
dreams
in
many
respects
the
two
men
were
kindred
their
conversations
were
frequently
perfunctory
but
lacked
no
whit
of
sustaining
grace
for
that
talk
after
all
is
pathetically
cheap
where
one
can
not
understand
without
words
no
amount
of
explanation
will
make
things
clear
across
impassable
deeps
like
lofty
peaks
of
widely
parted
ranges
soul
greets
soul
separated
forever
by
the
limitations
of
our
clay
we
live
and
die
absolutely
alone
even
love
the
magician
who
for
dazzling
moments
gives
new
sight
and
boundless
revelation
can
not
always
work
his
charm
a
third
of
our
lives
is
spent
in
sleep
and
who
shall
say
what
proportion
of
the
rest
is
endured
in
planetary
isolation
june
came
through
the
open
windows
of
the
house
upon
the
brink
of
the
cliff
and
the
master
dozed
in
his
chair
the
height
was
glaring
because
there
were
no
trees
the
spirit
of
german
progress
had
cut
down
every
one
of
the
lofty
pines
and
maples
save
at
the
edges
of
the
settlement
where
primeval
woods
sloping
down
to
the
valley
still
flourished
fräulein
fredrika
sat
with
her
face
resolutely
turned
to
the
west
it
was
sunday
and
almost
four
but
she
would
not
look
for
the
expected
guest
she
preferred
to
concentrate
her
mind
upon
something
else
and
when
the
rusty
creaked
experience
all
the
emotion
of
a
delightful
surprise
at
the
appointed
hour
he
came
and
the
colour
of
dead
rose
petals
bloomed
on
the
fräulein
withered
face
herr
doctor
she
said
it
is
most
kind
mine
brudder
will
be
pleased
wake
up
cried
the
doctor
with
a
hearty
laugh
as
he
strode
into
the
room
you
ca
sleep
all
the
time
so
said
the
master
with
an
understanding
smile
as
he
straightened
himself
and
rubbed
his
eyes
it
is
you
fräulein
fredrika
sat
in
the
corner
and
watched
the
two
whom
she
loved
best
in
all
the
world
no
one
was
so
wise
as
her
franz
unless
it
might
be
the
herr
doctor
to
whom
all
the
mysteries
of
life
and
death
were
as
an
open
book
to
me
said
the
doctor
once
much
has
been
given
to
see
my
father
has
graciously
allowed
me
to
help
him
i
am
first
to
welcome
the
soul
that
arrives
from
him
and
i
am
last
to
say
farewell
to
those
he
takes
back
what
wonder
if
now
and
then
i
presume
to
send
him
a
message
of
my
faith
and
my
belief
the
master
idea
of
satisfying
companionship
was
not
a
flow
of
uninterrupted
talk
marred
by
much
levity
he
merely
asked
that
his
friend
should
be
near
at
hand
that
he
might
communicate
with
him
when
he
chose
when
he
had
a
thought
which
seemed
worthy
of
dignified
inspection
he
would
offer
it
but
not
before
on
this
particular
afternoon
lynn
was
exceedingly
restless
like
many
other
men
to
whom
the
thing
is
impossible
he
vaguely
feared
feminisation
the
variety
of
soft
influences
continually
about
him
had
a
subtle
enervating
effect
iris
was
reading
his
mother
was
writing
letters
and
aunt
peace
was
endeavouring
to
entertain
him
with
reminiscences
of
her
early
youth
when
life
lies
fair
in
the
distance
with
the
rosy
hues
of
anticipation
transfiguring
its
rugged
steeps
and
yawning
chasms
we
are
young
though
our
years
may
number
threescore
and
ten
on
that
first
day
when
we
look
back
either
happily
or
with
remorse
to
the
stony
ways
over
which
we
have
travelled
losing
concern
for
that
part
of
the
journey
which
is
yet
to
come
we
have
grown
old
that
is
very
interesting
said
lynn
when
aunt
peace
had
finished
her
description
of
the
first
school
she
attended
i
think
i
go
out
for
a
walk
now
if
you
do
mind
will
you
tell
mother
please
when
she
comes
down
he
went
off
at
a
rapid
pace
and
made
a
long
circling
tour
of
east
lancaster
ending
at
the
bridge
where
he
too
leaned
over
and
looked
into
the
sunny
depths
of
the
stream
doctor
brinkerhoff
sign
waving
in
the
wind
gave
him
an
idea
accidentally
he
had
hit
upon
his
need
he
hungered
for
the
companionship
of
his
kind
but
doctor
brinkerhoff
was
not
at
home
and
the
deserted
corridors
echoed
strangely
beneath
his
tread
he
walked
the
length
of
the
long
hall
a
few
times
because
there
seemed
nothing
else
to
do
and
the
doctor
cat
locked
in
the
office
mewed
piteously
poor
pussy
said
lynn
consolingly
i
wish
i
could
let
you
out
but
i
ca
up
the
hill
he
went
his
nameless
irritation
already
sensibly
decreased
after
all
it
was
good
to
be
alive
to
breathe
the
free
air
feel
the
warm
sun
upon
his
cheek
and
the
springy
turf
beneath
his
feet
someone
is
coming
announced
fräulein
fredrika
i
think
it
will
be
the
herr
irving
herr
irving
repeated
the
master
mine
pupil
it
is
not
the
day
for
his
lesson
perhaps
someone
is
ill
suggested
the
doctor
but
as
it
happened
lynn
had
no
errand
save
that
of
pure
friendliness
his
buoyant
spirits
immediately
gave
a
freshness
to
the
themes
of
conversation
and
they
talked
until
sunset
it
is
good
to
have
friends
observed
the
master
in
one
wide
acquaintance
every
person
has
his
own
place
you
lose
one
friend
perhaps
and
you
think
i
can
get
along
without
him
but
it
is
not
so
we
have
as
many
sides
as
we
know
people
and
each
acquaintance
sees
a
different
one
which
is
often
only
a
reflection
of
himself
this
afternoon
we
have
been
speaking
of
truth
and
how
it
is
that
things
entirely
opposite
each
other
can
both
be
true
the
herr
doctor
says
it
is
because
truth
has
many
sides
but
i
say
no
truth
is
one
clear
white
light
and
we
are
with
many
corners
prisms
i
think
you
say
if
the
light
strikes
a
sharp
edge
it
breaks
into
many
colours
to
one
of
us
everything
will
be
purple
to
another
red
and
to
yet
one
more
it
will
be
all
blue
if
we
have
many
edges
we
see
many
colours
it
is
only
the
person
who
is
in
tune
who
lets
the
light
pass
with
no
interruption
who
sees
all
things
in
one
harmony
and
truth
as
it
is
yes
said
the
doctor
that
is
all
very
true
when
we
oppose
our
personal
opinion
to
the
thing
as
it
is
and
have
our
minds
set
upon
what
should
be
according
to
our
ideas
it
makes
an
edge
i
think
it
is
the
finest
art
of
living
to
see
things
as
they
are
and
make
the
best
of
them
there
is
so
little
that
we
can
change
if
the
colours
break
over
us
it
is
the
fault
of
our
sharp
edges
and
not
of
the
light
we
are
getting
very
serious
observed
lynn
for
my
part
i
take
each
day
just
as
it
comes
one
day
repeated
the
master
how
many
possible
things
there
are
in
it
what
was
it
the
poet
said
of
herr
columbus
yes
i
have
it
now
day
with
life
and
hope
and
heart
is
time
enough
to
find
a
world
that
is
the
beauty
of
it
put
in
the
doctor
one
day
is
surely
enough
an
old
lady
who
had
fallen
and
hurt
herself
badly
said
to
me
once
how
long
must
i
lie
here
patience
my
dear
madam
said
i
have
only
one
day
at
a
time
to
live
get
all
the
content
you
can
out
of
it
and
let
the
rest
wait
like
a
bud
till
the
sun
of
shows
you
the
rose
did
she
get
well
asked
lynn
of
course
why
not
his
sick
ones
always
get
well
said
fräulein
fredrika
timidly
mine
brudder
friend
possesses
great
skill
she
was
laying
the
table
for
the
simple
sunday
night
tea
and
lynn
said
that
he
must
go
no
no
objected
the
master
you
must
stay
it
would
be
of
a
niceness
the
fräulein
assured
him
very
politely
we
should
enjoy
it
said
the
doctor
you
are
all
very
kind
returned
lynn
but
they
will
look
for
me
at
home
and
i
must
not
disappoint
them
then
continued
the
doctor
may
i
not
hope
that
you
will
play
for
me
before
you
go
certainly
if
i
have
herr
kaufmann
permission
and
if
i
may
borrow
one
of
his
violins
of
a
surety
the
master
clattered
down
the
uncarpeted
stairs
and
returned
with
an
instrument
of
his
own
make
without
accompaniment
lynn
played
and
the
doctor
nodded
his
enthusiastic
approval
herr
kaufmann
looked
out
of
the
window
and
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
the
performance
very
fine
said
the
doctor
we
have
enjoyed
it
i
am
glad
replied
lynn
modestly
then
flushed
with
the
praise
and
his
own
pleasure
in
his
achievement
he
turned
to
the
master
how
am
i
getting
on
he
asked
anxiously
do
you
think
i
am
improving
yes
returned
the
master
dryly
by
next
week
you
will
be
one
paganini
stung
by
the
sarcasm
lynn
went
home
and
after
tea
the
group
resolved
itself
into
its
original
elements
herr
kaufmann
and
the
doctor
sat
in
their
respective
conversing
with
each
other
by
means
of
silences
with
here
and
there
a
word
of
comment
and
fräulein
fredrika
was
in
the
corner
silent
too
and
yet
overcome
with
admiration
that
boy
said
the
doctor
at
length
he
has
genius
the
crescent
moon
gleamed
faintly
against
the
sunset
and
a
wayworn
robin
with
wings
circled
toward
his
nest
in
one
of
the
maples
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
the
fragrant
dusk
sheltered
the
little
house
which
all
day
had
borne
the
heat
of
the
sun
possibly
said
the
master
but
no
heart
no
feeling
he
is
all
technique
there
was
another
long
pause
his
mother
observed
the
doctor
do
you
know
her
no
i
meet
no
women
but
mine
sister
she
is
a
lovely
lady
so
it
was
evident
that
the
master
had
no
interest
in
margaret
irving
but
the
doctor
still
brooded
upon
the
vision
she
was
different
from
anyone
else
in
east
lancaster
and
he
admired
her
very
much
that
boy
said
the
doctor
again
he
has
her
eyes
whose
his
mother
so
the
interval
lengthened
into
an
hour
and
presently
the
kitchen
clock
struck
ten
i
shall
go
now
remarked
the
doctor
rising
not
yet
said
the
master
come
they
went
downstairs
together
into
the
shop
it
had
happened
before
though
rarely
and
the
doctor
suspected
that
he
was
about
to
receive
the
greatest
possible
kindness
from
his
friend
hands
herr
kaufmann
disappeared
into
his
bedroom
and
was
gone
a
long
time
the
room
was
dark
and
the
doctor
did
not
dare
to
move
for
fear
of
stepping
upon
some
of
the
wood
destined
for
violins
a
cricket
in
the
corner
sang
cheerily
and
ceased
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
a
chirp
when
the
master
came
back
with
a
lighted
candle
one
moment
herr
doctor
he
whisked
off
again
and
presently
returned
holding
under
his
arm
something
that
was
wrapped
in
many
pieces
of
ragged
silk
one
by
one
these
were
removed
and
at
last
the
treasure
was
revealed
he
held
it
off
at
arm
length
where
the
light
might
shine
upon
its
beauty
and
well
out
of
reach
of
a
random
touch
the
doctor
said
the
expected
thing
but
it
fell
upon
deaf
ears
the
master
fine
face
was
alight
with
more
than
earthly
joy
and
he
stroked
the
brown
breasts
lovingly

he
breathed

bit
of

remarked
lynn
this
village
is
full
of
fossils
at
what
age
does
one
get
to
be
a
asked
aunt
peace
her
eyes
twinkling
that
is
fair
lynn
answered
resentfully
you
younger
than
any
of
us
aunt
peace
you
years
young
so
i
am
she
responded
good
humouredly
she
was
upon
excellent
terms
with
this
tall
straight
young
fellow
who
had
brought
new
life
into
her
household
a
march
wind
suddenly
sweeping
through
her
rooms
would
have
had
much
the
same
effect
am
i
a
fossil
asked
margaret
who
had
overheard
the
conversation
you
nothing
but
a
kid
mother
you
never
grown
up
i
can
do
what
i
please
with
you
he
picked
her
up
bodily
and
carried
her
flushed
and
protesting
to
her
favourite
chair
and
dumped
her
into
it
aunt
peace
is
there
any
place
in
the
house
where
you
might
care
to
go
thank
you
no
i
stay
where
i
am
if
i
may
i
very
comfortable
lynn
paced
back
and
forth
with
a
heavy
tread
which
resounded
upon
the
polished
floor
iris
happened
to
be
passing
the
door
and
looked
in
anxiously
for
signs
of
damage
iris
laughed
miss
field
what
a
little
old
maid
you
are
you
remind
me
of
that
story
we
read
together
which
story
aunt
peace
the
one
in
which
the
woman
married
a
careless
man
to
reform
him
she
used
to
follow
him
around
with
a
brush
and
dustpan
and
sweep
up
after
him
that
would
make
him
nice
and
comfortable
observed
lynn
what
became
of
the
man
he
was
sent
to
the
asylum
and
the
woman
asked
margaret
she
died
of
a
broken
heart
i
think
i
be
in
the
asylum
too
said
lynn
i
do
not
desire
to
be
swept
up
after
nobody
desires
to
sweep
up
after
you
retorted
iris
but
it
has
to
be
done
otherwise
the
house
would
be
uninhabitable
east
lancaster
continued
lynn
irrelevantly
is
the
abode
of
mummies
and
fossils
the
city
seal
is
a
broom
at
least
it
should
be
i
was
never
in
such
a
clean
place
in
my
life
the
exhibits
themselves
look
as
though
they
been
freshly
dusted
dirt
is
wholesome
did
you
ever
hear
that
how
the
population
has
lived
to
its
present
advanced
age
is
beyond
me
we
have
never
really
lived
returned
iris
with
a
touch
of
sarcasm
until
recently
before
you
came
we
existed
now
east
lancaster
lives
who
the
pious
party
in
brown
silk
with
the
irregular
dome
on
her
roof
asked
lynn
the
minister
second
wife
answered
aunt
peace
instantly
gathering
a
personality
from
the
brief
description
so
as
herr
kaufmann
says
might
one
inquire
about
the
jewel
she
wears
it
just
a
pin
said
iris
it
looks
more
like
a
glass
case
in
someway
it
reminds
me
of
a
museum
it
has
some
of
her
first
husband
hair
in
it
explained
iris
jerusalem
cried
lynn
that
the
limit
fancy
the
feelings
of
the
happy
bridegroom
whose
wife
wears
a
jewel
made
out
of
her
first
husband
fur
not
for
me
when
i
take
the
fatal
step
it
wo
be
a
widow
that
remarked
margaret
calmly
is
as
it
may
be
we
have
the
reputation
of
being
a
bad
lot
lynn
flushed
patted
his
mother
hand
awkwardly
and
hastily
beat
a
retreat
they
heard
him
in
the
room
overhead
walking
back
and
forth
and
practising
feverishly
margaret
asked
miss
field
suddenly
what
are
you
going
to
make
of
that
boy
a
good
man
first
she
answered
after
that
what
god
pleases
by
a
swift
change
the
conversation
had
become
serious
and
always
quick
at
perceiving
hidden
currents
iris
felt
herself
in
the
way
making
an
excuse
she
left
them
for
some
time
each
was
occupied
with
her
own
thoughts
margaret
said
miss
field
again
then
hesitated
yes
aunt
peace
what
is
it
my
little
girl
i
have
been
thinking
after
i
am
gone
you
know
do
talk
so
dear
aunt
peace
we
shall
have
you
with
us
for
a
long
time
yet
i
hope
so
returned
the
old
lady
brightly
but
i
am
not
endowed
with
immortality
at
least
not
here
and
i
have
already
lived
more
than
my
allotted
threescore
and
ten
my
problem
is
not
a
new
one
i
have
had
it
on
my
mind
for
years
and
when
you
came
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
had
come
to
help
me
solve
it
and
so
i
have
if
i
can
my
little
girl
said
aunt
peace
and
the
words
were
a
caress
she
has
given
to
me
infinitely
more
than
i
have
given
to
her
i
have
never
ceased
to
bless
the
day
i
found
her
between
these
two
there
were
no
questions
save
the
ordinary
meaningless
ones
which
make
so
large
a
part
of
conversation
the
deeps
were
silently
passed
by
only
the
shallows
were
touched
you
have
the
right
to
know
miss
field
continued
iris
is
twenty
now
or
possibly
she
has
never
known
when
her
birthday
came
and
so
we
celebrate
it
on
the
anniversary
of
the
day
i
found
her
i
was
driving
through
the
country
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
from
east
lancaster
i
i
was
with
doctor
brinkerhoff
she
went
on
unwillingly
he
had
asked
me
to
go
and
see
a
patient
of
his
in
whom
from
what
he
had
told
me
i
had
learned
to
take
great
interest
doctor
brinkerhoff
she
said
sturdily
is
a
gentleman
though
he
has
no
social
position
yes
replied
margaret
seeing
that
an
answer
was
expected
he
is
a
charming
gentleman
it
was
a
warm
summer
day
and
on
our
way
back
we
came
upon
a
dozen
or
more
ragged
children
playing
in
the
road
they
refused
to
let
us
pass
and
we
could
not
run
over
them
a
dilapidated
farmhouse
stood
close
by
but
no
one
was
in
sight
hold
the
lines
said
the
doctor
will
get
out
and
lead
the
horse
past
this
most
unnecessary
obstruction
when
he
got
out
the
children
began
to
throw
stones
at
the
horse
it
was
a
young
animal
and
it
started
so
violently
that
i
was
almost
thrown
from
my
seat
one
child
a
girl
of
ten
climbed
into
the
buggy
and
shrieked
to
the
rest
hold
the
lines
get
more
stones
i
was
frightened
and
furiously
angry
but
i
could
do
nothing
for
i
had
only
one
hand
free
i
tried
to
make
the
child
sit
down
and
she
struck
at
me
her
torn
sleeve
fell
back
and
i
saw
that
her
arm
was
bruised
as
if
with
heavy
blows
meanwhile
the
doctor
had
led
the
horse
a
little
way
ahead
and
had
come
back
the
whole
tribe
was
behind
us
yelling
like
wild
indians
and
we
were
in
the
midst
of
a
rain
of
stones
doctor
brinkerhoff
got
in
and
started
the
horse
at
full
speed
put
her
down
he
said
little
farther
on
she
can
walk
back
she
was
quiet
and
her
head
was
down
but
i
had
one
look
from
her
eyes
that
haunts
me
yet
she
hated
everybody
you
could
see
that
and
yet
there
was
a
sort
of
dumb
helplessness
about
it
that
made
my
heart
ache
she
got
out
obediently
when
we
told
her
to
and
stood
by
the
roadside
watching
us
i
said
child
is
not
like
the
others
and
she
has
been
badly
used
i
want
her
i
want
to
take
her
home
with
me
your
kind
heart
dear
lady
he
replied
laughing
and
we
were
almost
at
home
before
i
convinced
him
that
i
was
in
earnest
he
would
not
let
me
go
there
again
but
the
very
next
day
he
went
late
in
the
afternoon
and
brought
her
to
me
after
dark
so
that
no
one
might
see
east
lancaster
has
always
made
the
most
of
every
morsel
of
gossip
the
poor
little
soul
was
hungry
frightened
and
oh
so
dirty
i
gave
her
a
bath
cut
off
her
hair
which
was
matted
close
to
her
head
fed
her
and
put
her
into
a
clean
bed
the
bruises
on
her
body
would
have
brought
tears
from
a
stone
i
sat
by
her
until
she
was
asleep
and
then
went
down
to
interview
the
doctor
who
was
reading
in
the
library
he
said
that
the
people
who
had
her
were
more
than
glad
to
get
rid
of
her
and
hoped
that
they
might
never
see
her
again
nothing
had
been
paid
toward
her
support
for
a
long
time
and
they
considered
themselves
victimised
of
course
i
put
detectives
at
work
upon
the
case
and
soon
found
out
all
there
was
to
know
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
whose
stage
name
was
iris
temple
her
husband
deserted
her
a
few
months
after
their
marriage
and
when
the
child
was
born
she
was
absolutely
destitute
finally
she
found
work
but
she
could
not
take
the
child
with
her
and
so
iris
does
not
remember
her
mother
at
all
for
six
years
she
paid
these
people
a
small
sum
for
the
care
of
the
child
then
remittances
ceased
and
abuse
began
we
learned
that
she
had
died
in
a
hospital
but
there
was
no
trace
of
the
father
there
was
no
one
to
dispute
my
title
so
i
at
once
made
it
legal
shortly
afterward
she
had
a
long
terrible
fever
and
oh
margaret
the
things
that
poor
child
said
in
her
delirium
doctor
brinkerhoff
was
here
night
and
day
and
his
skill
saved
her
but
when
she
came
out
of
it
she
was
a
pitiful
little
ghost
mercifully
she
had
forgotten
a
great
deal
but
even
now
some
of
the
horror
comes
back
to
her
occasionally
she
knows
everything
except
that
her
mother
was
a
i
would
not
want
her
to
know
that
for
a
while
aunt
peace
went
on
we
both
had
a
very
hard
time
she
was
actually
depraved
but
i
believed
in
the
good
that
was
hidden
in
her
somewhere
there
is
good
in
all
of
us
if
we
can
only
find
it
and
little
by
little
she
learned
to
love
me
through
it
all
i
had
doctor
brinkerhoff
sympathetic
assistance
he
came
every
week
advised
me
counselled
with
me
helped
me
and
even
faced
the
gossips
all
that
east
lancaster
knows
is
the
simple
fact
that
i
found
a
child
who
attracted
me
discovered
that
her
parents
were
dead
and
adopted
her
there
was
a
great
deal
of
excitement
at
first
but
it
died
down
most
things
die
down
my
dear
if
we
give
them
time
dear
aunt
peace
said
margaret
softly
you
found
a
bit
of
human
driftwood
and
with
your
love
and
your
patience
made
it
into
a
beautiful
woman
the
old
face
softened
and
the
serene
eyes
grew
dim
whenever
i
think
that
my
life
has
been
in
vain
when
it
seems
empty
purposeless
and
bare
i
look
at
my
little
girl
remember
what
she
was
and
find
content
i
think
that
a
great
deal
will
be
forgiven
me
because
i
have
done
well
with
her
i
am
so
glad
you
told
me
continued
margaret
after
a
little
her
future
has
sorely
troubled
me
of
course
i
can
make
her
comfortable
but
money
is
not
everything
i
dread
to
have
her
go
away
from
east
lancaster
and
yet
she
never
need
go
interrupted
margaret
if
as
you
say
the
house
comes
to
me
there
is
no
reason
why
she
should
i
would
be
so
glad
to
have
her
with
me
thank
you
my
dear
it
was
what
i
wanted
but
i
did
not
like
to
ask
now
my
mind
will
be
at
rest
it
is
little
enough
to
do
for
you
leaving
her
out
of
the
question
she
might
be
a
great
deal
less
lovely
than
she
is
and
yet
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
do
it
for
you
she
will
repay
you
i
am
sure
said
aunt
peace
of
course
lynn
will
marry
sometime
here
the
mother
heart
stopped
beating
for
an
instant
and
went
on
unevenly
so
you
will
be
left
alone
you
can
not
expect
to
keep
him
in
a
place
like
east
lancaster
he
is
how
old
then
in
a
few
years
more
he
will
leave
you
aunt
peace
was
merely
meditating
aloud
as
she
looked
out
of
the
window
and
had
no
idea
that
she
was
hurting
her
listener
perhaps
after
all
iris
will
be
my
best
bequest
to
you
iris
may
marry
suggested
irving
trying
to
smile
iris
repeated
aunt
peace
no
indeed
i
have
made
her
an
spinster
like
myself
she
has
never
thought
of
such
things
and
never
will
at
the
moment
miss
temple
was
reading
an
anonymous
letter
much
worn
but
though
walls
have
ears
they
are
happily
blind
and
aunt
peace
did
not
realise
that
she
was
nowhere
near
the
mark
marriage
is
a
negative
relation
continued
miss
field
with
an
air
of
knowledge
people
undertake
it
from
an
unpardonable
individual
curiosity
they
see
it
all
around
them
and
yet
they
rush
in
blindly
trusting
that
their
own
venture
will
turn
out
differently
from
every
other
someone
once
said
that
it
was
like
a
crowded
church
those
outside
were
endeavouring
to
get
in
and
those
inside
were
making
violent
efforts
to
get
out
personally
i
have
had
the
better
part
of
it
i
have
my
home
my
independence
and
i
have
brought
up
a
child
moreover
i
have
not
been
annoyed
with
a
husband
suppose
one
falls
in
love
said
margaret
timidly
love
exclaimed
aunt
peace
stuff
and
nonsense
she
rose
majestically
and
went
out
with
her
head
high
and
the
step
of
a
grenadier
left
to
herself
margaret
mentally
reviewed
their
conversation
passing
resolutely
over
the
hurt
that
aunt
peace
had
unconsciously
made
in
her
heart
never
before
had
it
occurred
to
her
that
lynn
might
marry
he
ca
she
whispered
why
he
nothing
but
a
child
she
turned
her
thoughts
to
iris
and
aunt
peace
the
homeless
little
savage
had
grown
into
a
charming
woman
under
the
patient
care
of
the
only
mother
she
had
ever
known
if
aunt
peace
should
die
and
if
lynn
should
marry
she
did
not
phrase
the
thought
but
she
was
very
conscious
of
its
existence
she
and
iris
might
make
a
little
home
for
themselves
in
the
old
house
two
men
even
the
best
of
friends
can
never
make
a
home
but
two
women
on
speaking
terms
may
do
so
if
lynn
should
marry
insistently
the
torment
of
it
returned
if
he
should
fall
in
love
who
was
she
to
put
a
barrier
in
his
path
his
mother
whose
heart
had
been
hungry
all
these
years
should
she
keep
him
back
by
so
much
as
a
word
then
all
at
once
she
knew
that
it
was
her
own
warped
life
which
demanded
it
by
way
of
compensation
no
she
breathed
with
her
lips
white
i
will
never
stand
in
his
way
because
i
have
suffered
he
shall
not
then
she
laughed
hysterically
how
ridiculous
i
am
she
said
to
herself
why
he
is
nothing
but
a
child
the
mood
passed
and
the
woman
soul
began
to
dwell
upon
its
precious
memories
mnemosyne
that
guardian
angel
forever
separates
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
the
joy
from
the
pain
at
the
touch
of
her
hallowed
fingers
the
heartache
takes
on
a
certain
calmness
which
is
none
the
less
beautiful
because
it
is
wholly
made
of
tears
lynn
violin
was
silent
now
and
softly
from
the
back
of
the
house
the
girl
full
contralto
swelled
into
a
song
the
hours
i
spent
with
thee
dear
heart
are
as
a
string
of
pearls
to
me
i
count
them
over
every
one
apart
my
rosary
my
rosary
iris
sang
because
she
was
happy
but
none
the
less
the
deep
vibrant
voice
had
an
undertone
of
sadness
a
sorrow
which
by
right
of
inheritance
was
hers
margaret
thoughts
went
back
to
her
own
girlhood
when
she
was
no
older
than
the
unseen
singer
love
cup
had
been
at
her
lips
then
and
had
been
dashed
away
by
a
relentless
hand
o
memories
that
bless
and
burn
o
barren
pain
and
bitter
loss
i
kiss
each
bead
and
strive
at
last
to
learn
to
kiss
the
cross
sweetheart
to
kiss
the
cross
kiss
the
cross
muttered
margaret
then
the
tears
came
in
a
blinding
flood
mother
mother
she
sobbed
how
could
you
insensibly
something
was
changed
and
for
the
first
time
the
woman
who
had
gone
to
her
grave
unforgiven
seemed
not
entirely
beyond
the
reach
of
pardon
ix
rosemary
and
mignonette
sweet
lady
of
my
dreams
it
can
not
be
that
you
are
displeased
if
you
were
i
should
know
but
do
not
ask
me
how
day
by
day
my
eyes
long
for
the
sight
of
you
night
by
night
my
heart
remembers
you
for
that
inner
vision
does
not
vanish
with
the
sun
you
have
unconsciously
given
me
a
priceless
gift
for
wherever
i
may
go
i
take
you
with
me
all
the
grace
of
you
all
the
beauty
and
all
the
softness
i
have
only
to
close
my
eyes
and
then
i
see
but
do
not
think
i
keep
your
image
always
before
me
for
it
is
not
so
in
the
world
you
have
no
place
you
belong
rather
to
those
fair
lands
of
fancy
which
lie
just
beyond
the
borders
of
this
world
and
are
or
so
i
think
very
near
the
gleaming
gates
of
heaven
i
am
not
always
at
work
but
sometimes
even
when
i
am
you
come
tripping
before
my
eyes
so
dainty
so
wholly
exquisite
that
i
forget
what
i
am
doing
and
then
i
must
put
you
aside
but
when
the
day
is
done
and
the
light
of
it
shows
only
through
the
pinholes
pricked
in
the
curtain
of
night
then
i
can
think
of
you
as
radiant
as
beautiful
and
as
far
above
me
as
those
very
stars
all
unknowingly
you
are
the
light
of
my
day
whatever
darkness
might
surround
me
your
eyes
would
make
it
noon
however
steep
and
thorny
my
path
your
hand
in
mine
would
make
it
a
sunny
meadow
swept
by
shadowy
wings
where
the
white
and
crimson
clover
bloomed
all
day
you
give
me
life
you
make
the
birds
sing
more
sweetly
for
me
you
make
the
roses
more
fragrant
the
moonlight
more
like
pearl
you
have
glorified
the
commonplace
affairs
of
the
day
with
your
enchantment
you
have
put
the
joy
of
the
gods
into
the
heart
of
a
man
do
you
wonder
that
loving
you
like
this
i
do
not
make
myself
known
sweetheart
it
is
because
i
fear
already
i
have
more
than
i
deserve
because
you
are
not
displeased
with
me
and
since
i
wrote
last
i
have
made
progress
would
it
surprise
you
very
much
if
i
told
you
i
knew
where
you
lived
i
fancy
i
see
you
now
with
the
scarlet
signals
flaming
on
your
cheeks
but
iris
i
shall
never
intrude
it
is
for
you
to
say
whether
i
shall
love
you
in
silence
and
afar
or
face
to
face
as
i
dream
that
some
day
i
may
i
want
you
dear
i
want
you
with
all
my
heart
of
all
the
women
in
the
world
you
are
the
one
god
meant
for
me
otherwise
why
have
i
been
so
strangely
led
to
you
since
the
first
day
i
saw
you
i
have
knelt
at
your
feet
not
for
one
moment
have
i
forgotten
you
so
so
womanly
so
dear
so
will
it
always
be
whether
i
live
or
die
even
to
my
grave
i
shall
take
the
memory
of
you
my
memories
are
few
but
my
dreams
they
are
so
many
that
i
could
not
begin
to
tell
you
all
but
one
of
them
you
must
know
that
some
day
you
will
let
me
tell
you
how
much
i
love
you
and
promise
me
that
i
may
shield
you
all
the
rest
of
your
life
the
wind
should
never
make
you
cold
the
sun
should
never
shine
too
fiercely
upon
you
the
storm
should
never
beat
against
you
if
i
had
my
way
iris
may
i
come
will
you
let
me
teach
you
to
care
so
sure
am
i
of
my
love
that
i
ask
only
for
the
chance
to
make
you
believe
put
a
flower
on
your
when
the
moon
rises
if
you
are
willing
that
i
should
come
two
flowers
if
you
are
willing
that
i
should
come
sometime
but
not
now
then
when
your
embroiders
the
marshes
you
will
know
who
loves
you
who
worships
you
who
offers
you
his
all
that
night
when
the
moon
swung
high
in
the
heavens
iris
tiptoed
out
into
the
garden
with
the
letter
sentient
alive
and
human
crushed
close
against
her
heart
so
conscious
was
she
of
its
presence
that
she
felt
it
blazoned
upon
her
breast
for
all
the
world
to
read
dew
made
the
grass
damp
but
iris
did
not
care
threads
of
silver
light
picked
out
a
dainty
tracery
and
here
and
there
set
a
to
gleaming
like
a
diamond
among
unnumbered
pearls
drowsy
chirps
came
from
the
maples
above
her
where
the
little
birds
slept
in
their
swaying
nests
and
dreamed
of
wild
flights
at
dawn
a
great
white
moth
brushed
against
her
face
as
softly
as
thistledown
and
she
laughed
because
it
was
so
like
a
kiss
down
toward
her
corner
of
the
garden
she
went
her
dimity
skirts
daintily
uplifted
the
moonlight
touched
a
cobweb
woven
across
the
and
made
a
rainbow
of
it
a
little
lost
rainbow
thought
iris
out
alone
in
the
night
like
me
she
stooped
and
gathered
a
sprig
of
mignonette
then
a
bit
of
rosemary
from
irving
garden
she
wo
care
said
iris
to
herself
she
used
to
love
somebody
long
ago
she
bound
the
two
together
with
a
blade
of
grass
and
put
the
merest
kiss
between
them
then
impulsively
wiped
it
away
but
after
all
some
trace
of
it
must
linger
and
iris
did
not
intend
to
give
too
much
so
she
threw
it
aside
as
it
happened
into
lynn
garden
then
she
gathered
another
sprig
of
mignonette
another
leaf
of
rosemary
bound
them
together
and
held
them
very
far
away
out
of
reach
of
temptation
back
toward
the
gate
she
went
her
heart
wildly
beating
against
the
imprisoned
letter
she
hesitated
a
moment
in
the
shadow
of
the
house
the
great
white
moth
had
followed
her
and
again
touched
her
face
caressingly
suppose
someone
should
see
but
there
was
no
one
in
sight
anyhow
thought
iris
if
one
wishes
to
come
out
for
a
moment
in
the
evening
to
walk
as
far
as
the
gate
it
is
all
right
if
there
should
be
rosemary
and
mignonette
on
the
in
the
morning
someone
who
was
up
very
early
might
take
it
away
before
anybody
had
seen
it
there
would
be
no
harm
in
leaving
it
there
overnight
even
though
it
is
quite
orderly
she
went
bravely
toward
the
gate
and
the
moonbeams
made
an
aureole
about
her
hair
the
light
of
dreams
shining
through
the
mist
transfigured
her
with
silver
sheen
the
earth
was
exquisitely
still
and
the
sound
of
her
little
feet
upon
the
gravelled
path
echoed
and
strangely
timidly
iris
put
the
rosemary
and
mignonette
bound
together
by
a
single
blade
of
grass
first
upon
one
and
then
upon
the
other
such
a
little
bit
she
mused
one
could
call
it
a
flower
yes
mignonette
was
a
flower
but
rosemary
surely
no
she
walked
backward
slowly
toward
the
house
and
to
her
conscious
eyes
the
message
dominated
the
landscape
the
moonlight
fairly
made
it
shine
almost
at
the
steps
iris
was
seized
with
panic
then
her
light
feet
twinkled
down
the
path
and
frightened
trembling
and
ashamed
she
thrust
the
nosegay
into
the
open
throat
of
her
gown
oh
murmured
iris
as
she
went
hastily
into
the
house
what
could
i
have
been
thinking
of
but
across
the
street
in
the
darkness
of
the
shrubbery
someone
smiled
x
in
the
garden
said
aunt
peace
we
will
sit
in
the
garden
it
was
wednesday
and
the
rites
in
the
house
were
somewhat
relaxed
though
iris
from
force
of
habit
polished
the
tall
silver
candlesticks
until
they
shone
like
new
miss
field
herself
made
a
pan
of
little
cakes
sprinkled
them
with
powdered
sugar
and
put
them
away
she
was
never
lovelier
than
when
at
her
dainty
tasks
in
her
spotless
kitchen
by
some
alchemy
of
the
spirit
she
made
the
homely
duties
of
the
day
into
pleasures
simple
ones
perhaps
but
none
the
less
genuine
no
one
alluded
to
the
fact
that
doctor
brinkerhoff
was
coming
of
course
as
iris
said
to
lynn
we
do
know
that
he
is
but
since
missed
only
one
wednesday
in
ten
years
we
may
be
pardoned
for
expecting
him
one
might
think
so
agreed
lynn
laughing
he
took
keen
delight
in
the
regular
wednesday
evening
comedy
we
make
the
little
cakes
for
tea
continued
iris
her
eyes
dancing
but
we
never
have
for
tea
lynn
objected
and
i
wish
you
quit
talking
about
it
disturbs
my
peace
of
mind
pig
exclaimed
iris
they
were
alone
and
her
face
was
dangerously
near
his
her
rosy
lips
were
twitching
in
a
most
provoking
way
and
immediately
there
were
consequences
she
left
the
print
of
four
firm
fingers
upon
lynn
cheek
and
he
rubbed
the
injured
place
ruefully
i
do
see
why
i
should
kiss
you
he
said
if
you
have
learned
yet
i
slap
you
again
no
you
wo
i
hold
your
hands
next
time
there
is
going
to
be
any
time
the
idea
iris
please
do
go
away
wait
a
minute
i
want
to
talk
to
you
it
too
bad
it
so
remarked
iris
with
a
sidelong
glance
look
here
well
i
looking
but
so
much
green
the
grass
and
the
shrubbery
you
know
and
all
it
hard
on
my
eyes
we
cousins
are
we
iris
sat
down
on
the
bench
beside
him
evidently
struck
by
a
new
idea
i
had
thought
of
it
she
said
conversationally
are
we
i
think
we
are
mother
is
aunt
peace
nephew
is
she
not
that
anybody
knows
of
a
lady
nephew
is
called
a
niece
in
east
lancaster
oh
well
replied
lynn
colouring
you
know
what
i
mean
mother
is
aunt
peace
niece
is
she
i
hear
so
a
gentleman
for
whom
i
have
much
respect
assures
me
of
it
the
wicked
light
in
her
eyes
belied
her
words
and
lynn
wished
that
he
had
kissed
her
twice
while
he
had
the
opportunity
it
the
truth
he
said
and
mother
my
mother
really
so
that
makes
me
aunt
peace
nephew
corrected
iris
with
double
meaning
thank
you
for
the
compliment
perhaps
i
a
i
have
seen
any
signs
of
removal
observed
iris
but
i
love
to
do
be
so
frivolous
if
i
am
aunt
peace
nephew
what
relation
am
i
to
her
daughter
legal
daughter
iris
suggested
legal
daughter
is
just
as
good
as
any
other
kind
of
a
daughter
that
makes
me
your
cousin
legal
cousin
explained
iris
but
not
moral
it
all
the
same
even
in
east
lancaster
i
your
legal
repeated
iris
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
a
distant
robin
that
just
the
same
as
a
plain
cousin
you
plain
enough
to
be
a
plain
cousin
she
observed
and
the
colour
deepened
upon
lynn
handsome
face
so
i
going
to
kiss
you
again
you
not
she
said
with
an
air
of
finality
she
flew
into
the
house
and
took
refuge
beside
irving
mother
cried
lynn
closely
following
is
iris
my
cousin
no
dear
she
no
relation
at
all
so
now
exclaimed
iris
in
triumph
you
will
please
make
your
escape
immediately
little
witch
thought
lynn
as
he
went
upstairs
i
see
that
she
does
slap
me
next
time
iris
said
irving
suddenly
you
are
very
beautiful
am
i
really
for
a
moment
the
girl
deep
eyes
were
filled
with
wonder
and
then
she
smiled
it
is
because
you
love
me
she
said
dropping
a
tiny
kiss
upon
margaret
white
forehead
and
because
i
love
you
i
think
you
are
beautiful
too
alone
in
her
room
iris
studied
herself
in
her
small
mirror
it
was
just
large
enough
to
see
one
face
in
for
aunt
peace
did
not
believe
in
cultivating
vanity
in
others
in
her
own
room
was
a
long
where
a
certain
young
person
stole
brief
glimpses
of
herself
i
go
in
there
she
thought
aunt
peace
is
in
the
kitchen
and
no
one
will
know
she
left
the
door
open
that
she
might
hear
approaching
footsteps
and
was
presently
lost
in
contemplation
she
turned
her
head
this
way
and
that
taking
pleasure
in
the
gleam
of
light
upon
the
shining
coils
of
her
hair
and
in
the
rosy
tint
of
her
cheeks
just
above
the
corner
of
her
mouth
there
was
the
merest
dimple
iris
smiled
and
then
poked
an
inquiring
finger
into
it
i
did
know
i
had
that
she
said
to
herself
in
surprise
i
wonder
why
i
have
a
glass
like
this
in
my
room
there
one
in
the
attic
i
know
there
is
and
oh
how
lovely
it
would
be
it
where
i
kissed
you
said
lynn
from
the
doorway
if
you
keep
still
i
make
another
one
for
you
on
the
other
side
you
did
have
that
dimple
yesterday
irving
replied
iris
with
icy
calmness
you
will
kindly
let
me
pass
he
stepped
aside
half
afraid
of
her
in
this
new
mood
and
she
went
down
the
hall
to
her
own
room
she
shut
the
door
with
unmistakable
firmness
and
lynn
sighed
happy
mirror
he
thought
she
the
prettiest
thing
that
ever
looked
into
it
but
was
she
after
all
since
the
great
mirror
came
as
part
of
the
marriage
portion
of
a
bride
many
young
eyes
had
sought
its
shining
surface
and
lingered
upon
the
vision
of
their
own
loveliness
many
a
woman
day
by
day
had
watched
herself
grow
old
and
the
mirror
had
seen
tears
because
of
it
the
portraits
in
the
hall
and
the
old
mirror
had
shared
many
a
secret
together
happily
neither
could
betray
the
other
confidence
iris
meanwhile
was
finding
such
satisfaction
as
she
might
in
the
smaller
glass
and
meditating
upon
the
desirability
of
the
one
in
the
attic
i
ask
aunt
peace
she
thought
and
knew
instantly
that
she
would
ask
aunt
peace
for
worlds
i
vain
she
said
to
herself
reprovingly
i
a
vain
little
thing
and
i
wo
look
in
the
mirror
any
more
so
there
she
reviewed
her
humdrum
round
of
daily
duties
with
increasing
pity
for
herself
then
she
had
had
only
the
books
and
the
people
who
moved
across
their
eloquent
pages
but
now
surely
cupid
had
come
to
east
lancaster
just
think
two
letters
not
so
very
far
apart
from
someone
who
worshipped
her
at
a
distance
and
was
afraid
to
sign
his
name
and
this
very
day
not
more
than
an
hour
ago
she
had
been
kissed
no
man
had
ever
kissed
iris
before
not
even
a
still
she
rather
wished
it
had
happened
for
she
felt
different
someway
it
would
have
been
better
if
the
writer
of
the
letters
had
done
it
a
romance
like
this
set
her
far
above
the
commonplace
she
felt
very
much
older
than
lynn
and
was
inclined
to
patronise
him
he
was
nothing
but
a
boy
who
chased
one
around
the
garden
with
worms
and
put
grasshoppers
in
one
hat
yet
one
could
pardon
those
things
when
one
was
so
undeniably
popular
after
tea
they
sat
in
the
shadowy
coolness
of
the
parlour
waiting
the
very
air
was
expectant
aunt
peace
was
beautiful
in
shimmering
white
with
the
emerald
gleaming
at
her
throat
irving
as
always
wore
a
black
gown
and
iris
had
donned
her
best
lavender
muslin
in
honour
of
the
occasion
why
ca
we
go
outside
asked
margaret
we
can
my
dear
returned
aunt
peace
but
i
was
taught
that
it
was
better
to
wait
in
the
house
until
after
calling
hours
of
course
there
are
few
visitors
in
east
lancaster
but
even
on
a
desert
island
one
must
observe
the
proprieties
and
a
lady
will
always
receive
her
guests
in
the
house
while
she
was
speaking
doctor
brinkerhoff
opened
the
gate
miss
field
affected
not
to
see
him
and
waited
until
the
maid
ushered
him
in
good
evening
doctor
she
said
i
assure
you
this
is
quite
a
pleasure
his
manner
toward
the
others
was
gentle
and
even
courtly
but
he
distinguished
miss
field
by
elaborate
deference
if
he
disagreed
with
her
it
was
with
evident
respect
for
her
opinion
and
upon
all
disputed
points
he
seemed
eager
to
be
convinced
shall
we
not
go
into
the
garden
asked
aunt
peace
addressing
them
all
we
were
just
upon
the
point
of
going
doctor
when
you
came
she
led
the
way
with
the
doctor
beside
her
attentive
gallant
and
considerate
margaret
came
next
with
miss
field
white
shawl
behind
were
lynn
and
iris
laughing
like
children
at
some
secret
joke
by
a
strange
coincidence
five
chairs
were
arranged
in
a
sociable
group
under
the
tall
pine
in
a
corner
of
the
garden
yes
miss
field
was
saying
i
think
east
lancaster
is
most
beautiful
at
this
time
of
year
i
have
not
travelled
much
but
i
have
seen
pictures
and
i
am
content
with
my
own
little
corner
of
the
world
and
yet
madam
returned
the
doctor
you
would
so
much
enjoy
travelling
it
is
too
bad
that
you
can
not
go
abroad
perhaps
i
may
i
have
not
thought
of
it
but
as
you
speak
of
it
it
seems
to
me
that
it
might
be
very
pleasant
to
go
aunt
peace
exclaimed
irving
what
are
you
thinking
of
not
of
my
years
my
dear
you
may
be
sure
of
that
why
should
she
go
asked
lynn
aunt
peace
could
go
anywhere
and
come
back
safely
everybody
she
met
would
fall
in
love
with
her
and
see
that
she
was
comfortable
quite
right
said
the
doctor
with
evident
sincerity
flatterers
she
laughed
fie
upon
you
but
there
was
a
note
of
happy
youthfulness
in
the
voice
and
they
knew
that
she
was
pleased
if
you
go
madam
the
doctor
continued
it
will
be
my
pleasure
to
give
you
letters
to
friends
of
mine
in
germany
thank
you
she
returned
with
a
stately
inclination
of
her
head
it
would
be
very
kind
and
he
went
on
i
have
many
books
which
would
be
of
service
to
you
shall
i
bring
some
of
them
the
next
time
i
come
i
would
not
trouble
you
doctor
but
sometime
if
you
happened
to
be
passing
yes
he
answered
when
i
happen
to
be
passing
i
shall
not
forget
they
might
be
interesting
if
not
of
actual
service
i
am
familiar
with
much
that
has
been
written
of
foreign
lands
we
have
in
our
library
the
doctor
coughed
into
his
handkerchief
the
world
has
changed
dear
madam
since
marco
polo
travelled
yes
she
sighed
it
is
always
changing
and
we
older
ones
are
left
far
behind
oh
nonsense
exclaimed
lynn
i
tell
you
what
aunt
peace
well
up
at
the
head
of
the
procession
you
no
farther
behind
than
the
is
the
my
dear
i
do
not
understand
is
he
a
military
gentleman
he
the
boss
of
the
whole
shooting
match
explained
lynn
inelegantly
he
wears
a
bonnet
and
tickles
the
music
out
of
the
band
if
it
were
for
him
the
whole
show
would
go
up
in
smoke
lynn
said
margaret
reprovingly
what
language
aunt
peace
can
not
understand
you
i
bet
on
aunt
peace
remarked
lynn
sagely
i
fear
i
am
not
quite
abreast
of
the
times
said
the
old
lady
do
you
think
doctor
that
the
world
grows
better
or
worse
better
madam
steadily
better
i
can
see
it
every
day
it
is
well
for
one
to
think
so
observed
margaret
whatever
the
facts
may
be
midsummer
and
moonlight
made
enchantment
in
the
garden
merlin
himself
could
have
done
no
more
the
house
half
hidden
in
the
shadow
stood
waiting
as
it
had
done
for
two
centuries
while
those
who
belonged
under
its
roof
made
holiday
outside
most
of
them
had
gone
forever
and
only
their
portraits
were
left
but
replete
with
memories
both
happy
and
sad
the
house
could
not
be
said
to
be
alone
the
tall
pine
threw
its
gloom
far
beyond
them
and
the
moonlight
touched
aunt
peace
caressingly
her
silvered
hair
gleamed
with
unearthly
beauty
and
her
serene
eyes
gave
sweet
significance
to
her
name
all
those
she
cared
for
were
about
her
daughter
and
friends
nights
like
this
said
the
doctor
dreamily
make
one
think
of
the
old
fairy
tales
elves
and
witches
are
not
impossible
when
the
moon
shines
like
this
lynn
looked
across
the
garden
to
the
where
a
cobweb
had
captured
a
bit
of
wandering
rainbow
they
are
far
from
impossible
he
answered
i
think
they
were
here
only
the
other
night
for
in
the
morning
when
i
went
out
to
look
at
my
vegetables
i
found
something
queer
among
the
leaves
something
queer
my
dear
asked
aunt
peace
with
interest
what
was
it
a
leaf
of
rosemary
and
a
sprig
of
mignonette
tied
round
with
a
blade
of
grass
and
wet
with
dew
how
strange
said
margaret
how
could
it
have
happened
rosemary
said
aunt
peace
that
means
remembrance
and
the
mignonette
means
the
hope
of
love
a
very
pretty
message
for
a
fairy
to
leave
among
your
vegetables
very
pretty
repeated
the
doctor
nodding
appreciation
iris
feared
they
heard
the
loud
beating
of
her
heart
what
do
you
think
asked
lynn
turning
to
her
was
it
a
fairy
of
course
she
returned
with
assumed
indifference
who
else
there
was
silence
then
and
in
the
house
the
clock
struck
ten
they
heard
it
plainly
and
the
doctor
with
a
start
of
recollection
took
out
his
huge
silver
watch
i
had
no
idea
it
was
so
late
he
said
i
must
go
one
moment
doctor
began
miss
field
putting
out
a
restraining
hand
let
me
offer
you
some
refreshment
before
you
start
upon
that
long
walk
iris
yes
aunt
peace
those
little
cakes
that
we
had
for
tea
there
may
be
one
or
two
left
and
is
there
not
a
little
wine
i
see
lynn
followed
her
and
presently
they
came
back
with
the
royal
worcester
plate
piled
generously
with
cakes
and
a
decanter
of
the
port
that
was
famous
throughout
east
lancaster
with
a
smile
upon
her
lips
the
old
lady
leaned
forward
into
the
moonlight
glass
in
hand
the
brim
of
another
touched
it
and
the
clear
ring
of
crystal
seemed
carried
afar
into
the
night
to
your
good
health
madam
and
to
your
prosperity
this
has
been
very
charming
said
the
doctor
as
he
brushed
away
the
crumbs
and
now
my
dear
miss
iris
may
we
not
hope
for
a
song
which
one
laurie
if
you
please
iris
went
in
and
margaret
made
a
move
to
follow
her
do
go
mother
said
lynn
let
stay
here
i
afraid
aunt
peace
will
take
cold
no
dearie
i
have
my
shawl
let
me
be
young
again
just
for
with
no
fear
of
draughts
or
colds
midsummer
has
never
hurt
anyone
and
as
doctor
brinkerhoff
says
the
good
fairies
are
abroad
the
ballad
took
on
new
beauty
and
meaning
mellowed
by
the
distance
the
girl
deep
contralto
was
surpassingly
tender
and
sweet
when
she
came
out
the
others
were
silent
with
the
spell
of
her
song
still
upon
them
a
good
voice
said
lynn
half
to
himself
she
should
study
iris
has
had
lessons
returned
aunt
peace
with
gentle
dignity
and
her
voice
pleases
her
friends
what
is
there
beyond
that
fame
said
lynn
fame
is
the
love
of
the
many
aunt
peace
rejoined
and
counts
for
no
more
than
the
love
of
the
few
the
great
ones
have
said
it
was
barren
and
my
little
girl
will
be
better
off
here
as
she
spoke
she
put
her
arm
around
iris
and
they
went
to
the
house
together
at
the
steps
there
was
a
pause
and
doctor
brinkerhoff
said
good
night
it
has
been
perfect
said
miss
field
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
if
this
were
to
be
my
last
night
on
earth
i
could
not
ask
for
more
my
beautiful
garden
with
the
moonlight
shining
upon
it
music
and
my
best
friends
the
doctor
was
touched
and
bent
low
over
her
hand
pressing
it
ever
so
lightly
with
his
lips
i
thank
you
dear
madam
he
answered
gently
for
the
happiest
evening
i
have
ever
spent
come
again
then
she
said
graciously
with
a
happy
little
laugh
the
years
stretch
fair
before
us
when
one
is
but
that
night
just
at
the
turn
of
dawn
margaret
was
awakened
by
a
hot
hand
upon
her
face
dearie
said
aunt
peace
weakly
will
you
come
i
almost
burning
up
with
fever
xi
sunset
and
evening
star
doctor
brinkerhoff
came
in
the
morning
but
afterward
when
margaret
questioned
him
he
shook
his
head
sadly
i
will
do
the
best
i
can
he
said
and
none
of
us
can
do
more
he
went
down
the
path
bent
and
old
he
seemed
to
have
aged
since
the
previous
night
on
friday
lynn
went
to
herr
kaufmann
as
usual
but
he
played
carelessly
young
man
said
the
master
why
is
it
that
you
study
the
violin
why
repeated
lynn
well
why
not
it
is
all
the
same
returned
the
master
frankly
i
can
teach
you
nothing
you
have
the
technique
and
the
good
wrist
you
read
quickly
but
you
play
like
one
parrot
when
i
say
you
play
fortissimo
when
i
say
you
play
allegro
you
are
one
obedient
pupil
he
continued
making
no
effort
to
conceal
his
scorn
what
else
should
i
be
asked
lynn
do
not
misunderstand
said
the
master
more
kindly
you
can
play
the
music
as
it
is
written
if
that
satisfies
you
well
and
good
but
the
great
ones
have
something
more
they
make
the
music
to
talk
from
one
to
another
but
you
express
nothing
it
is
a
possibility
that
you
have
nothing
to
express
lynn
walked
back
and
forth
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
vaguely
troubled
one
moment
the
master
went
on
have
you
ever
felt
sorry
sorry
for
what
anything
of
course
i
am
often
sorry
well
sighed
the
master
instantly
comprehending
you
are
young
and
it
may
yet
come
but
the
sorrows
of
youth
are
more
sharp
than
those
of
age
and
there
is
not
much
chance
the
violin
is
the
most
noble
of
instruments
it
is
for
those
who
have
been
sorry
to
play
to
those
who
are
you
have
nothing
to
give
but
it
is
one
pity
to
lose
your
fine
technique
since
you
wish
to
amuse
change
your
instrument
and
study
the
banjo
or
perhaps
the
concertina
lynn
understood
no
more
than
if
herr
kaufmann
had
spoken
in
a
foreign
tongue
i
may
have
to
stop
for
a
little
while
he
said
for
my
aunt
is
ill
and
i
ca
practise
practise
here
returned
the
master
indifferently
fredrika
will
not
care
or
go
to
the
office
of
mine
friend
the
herr
doctor
he
will
not
mind
a
fine
gentleman
but
he
has
no
ear
no
taste
until
you
acquire
the
concertina
you
may
keep
on
with
the
violin
my
mother
began
lynn
she
wants
me
to
be
an
artist
an
artist
repeated
the
master
with
a
bitter
laugh
your
mother
here
he
paused
and
looked
keenly
into
lynn
eyes
something
was
stirred
some
memory
she
believes
in
you
is
it
not
so
yes
she
does
she
has
always
believed
in
me
well
said
the
master
with
an
indefinable
shrug
we
must
not
disappoint
her
you
work
on
like
one
faithful
parrot
and
i
continue
with
your
instruction
it
is
good
that
mothers
are
so
easy
to
please
herr
kaufmann
pleaded
the
boy
tell
me
shall
i
ever
be
an
artist
yes
i
think
so
when
when
the
river
flows
up
hill
and
the
sun
rises
in
the
west
suddenly
lynn
face
turned
white
i
will
he
cried
passionately
i
will
i
will
be
an
artist
i
tell
you
i
will
perhaps
returned
the
master
he
was
apparently
unmoved
but
afterward
when
lynn
had
gone
he
regretted
his
harshness
i
may
be
mistaken
he
admitted
to
himself
grudgingly
there
may
be
something
in
the
boy
after
all
he
is
young
yet
and
his
mother
she
believes
in
him
well
we
shall
see
lynn
went
home
by
a
long
circuitous
route
far
beyond
east
lancaster
was
a
stretch
of
woodland
which
he
had
not
as
yet
explored
herr
kaufmann
words
still
rang
in
his
ears
and
for
the
first
time
he
doubted
himself
he
sat
down
on
a
rock
to
think
it
over
he
said
i
had
the
technique
mused
lynn
but
why
should
i
feel
sorry
after
long
study
he
concluded
that
the
master
was
eccentric
as
genius
is
popularly
supposed
to
be
and
determined
to
think
no
more
of
it
still
it
was
not
so
easily
put
wholly
aside
you
play
like
one
parrot
that
single
sentence
like
a
barbed
shaft
had
pierced
the
armour
of
his
he
went
on
through
the
woods
and
stopped
at
a
pile
of
rocks
near
a
spring
it
might
have
been
an
altar
erected
to
the
deity
of
the
wood
but
for
one
symbol
on
the
topmost
stone
was
chiselled
a
cross
wonder
who
did
it
said
lynn
to
himself
and
what
for
he
found
some
wild
berries
made
a
cup
of
leaves
and
filled
it
with
the
fragrant
fruit
planning
to
take
it
to
aunt
peace
but
when
he
reached
home
aunt
peace
was
far
beyond
the
thought
of
berries
she
was
delirious
and
her
ravings
were
pitiful
iris
was
as
white
as
a
ghost
and
margaret
was
sorely
troubled
lynn
she
said
do
go
away
i
need
you
where
have
you
been
to
my
lesson
and
then
for
a
walk
herr
kaufmann
says
i
may
practise
there
sometimes
he
also
suggested
doctor
brinkerhoff
that
was
kind
and
i
am
sure
the
doctor
will
be
willing
how
does
he
think
you
are
getting
along
she
asked
the
question
idly
and
scarcely
expected
an
answer
but
lynn
turned
his
face
away
and
refused
to
meet
her
eyes
not
very
well
he
said
in
a
low
tone
why
not
dear
you
practise
enough
do
you
yes
i
think
so
he
says
i
have
the
technique
and
the
good
wrist
but
i
play
like
a
parrot
and
can
only
amuse
he
told
me
to
take
up
the
concertina
margaret
smiled
that
is
his
way
just
go
on
dear
and
do
the
very
best
you
can
but
i
do
want
to
disappoint
you
mother
i
want
to
be
an
artist
lynn
dear
you
will
never
disappoint
me
you
have
been
a
comfort
to
me
since
the
day
you
were
born
what
should
i
have
done
without
you
in
all
these
years
that
i
have
been
alone
she
drew
his
tall
head
down
and
kissed
him
but
lynn
evaded
the
sentiment
and
turned
it
into
a
joke
that
very
irish
mother
would
you
have
done
without
me
in
all
the
time
been
alone
how
is
the
invalid
the
fever
is
high
sighed
margaret
and
doctor
brinkerhoff
looks
very
grave
i
hope
she
is
going
to
die
said
lynn
conventionally
can
i
do
anything
no
nothing
but
wait
sometimes
i
think
that
waiting
is
the
very
hardest
thing
in
the
world
that
day
was
like
the
others
weeks
went
by
and
still
aunt
peace
fought
gallantly
with
her
enemy
doctor
brinkerhoff
took
up
his
abode
in
the
great
spare
chamber
and
was
absent
from
the
house
only
when
there
was
urgent
need
of
his
services
elsewhere
he
even
gave
up
his
sunday
afternoons
at
herr
kaufmann
and
fräulein
fredrika
was
secretly
distressed
fredrika
said
the
master
gently
the
suffering
ones
have
need
of
our
friend
we
must
not
be
selfish
our
friend
possesses
great
skill
replied
the
fräulein
with
quiet
dignity
do
you
think
he
will
forget
us
franz
forget
us
no
fear
not
fredrika
it
is
only
little
loves
and
little
friendships
that
forget
one
does
not
need
those
ties
which
can
be
broken
the
herr
doctor
himself
has
said
that
and
of
a
surety
he
knows
let
us
be
patient
and
wait
to
wait
repeated
fredrika
one
finds
it
difficult
is
it
not
so
yes
smiled
the
master
but
when
one
has
learned
to
wait
patiently
one
has
learned
to
live
meanwhile
aunt
peace
grew
steadily
weaker
and
the
strain
was
beginning
to
tell
upon
all
doctor
brinkerhoff
had
lost
his
youth
he
was
an
old
man
margaret
painfully
anxious
found
relief
from
heartache
only
in
unremitting
toil
iris
ate
very
little
slept
scarcely
at
all
and
crept
about
the
house
like
the
ghost
of
her
former
self
lynn
alone
maintained
his
cheerfulness
iris
said
aunt
peace
one
day
come
here
i
here
said
the
girl
kneeling
beside
the
bed
and
putting
her
cold
hand
upon
the
other
burning
cheek
what
can
i
do
nothing
dearie
i
could
get
well
i
think
were
it
not
for
my
terrible
dreams
iris
shuddered
and
yet
was
thankful
because
aunt
peace
could
call
her
delirium
dreams
lately
continued
aunt
peace
i
have
been
afraid
that
i
am
not
going
to
get
well
do
cried
iris
sharply
turning
her
face
away
dearie
dearie
said
the
other
caressingly
be
my
brave
girl
and
let
me
talk
to
you
when
the
dreams
come
back
i
shall
not
know
you
but
now
i
do
i
am
stronger
and
we
are
alone
are
we
not
where
are
the
others
the
doctor
has
gone
to
see
someone
who
is
very
lynn
has
taken
irving
out
for
a
walk
i
am
glad
said
aunt
peace
tenderly
margaret
has
been
very
good
to
me
you
have
all
been
good
to
me
iris
stroked
the
flushed
face
softly
with
her
cool
hand
in
her
eyes
were
love
and
longing
and
a
foreshadowed
loneliness
dearie
aunt
peace
continued
listen
while
i
have
the
strength
to
speak
all
the
papers
are
in
a
tin
box
in
the
trunk
in
the
attic
there
you
will
find
everything
that
is
known
of
your
father
and
mother
i
do
not
anticipate
any
need
of
the
information
but
it
is
well
that
you
should
know
where
to
find
it
i
have
left
the
house
to
margaret
she
went
on
with
difficulty
for
it
was
rightfully
hers
and
after
her
it
goes
to
lynn
but
there
is
a
distinct
understanding
that
it
shall
be
your
home
while
you
live
if
you
choose
to
claim
it
margaret
has
promised
me
to
keep
you
with
her
when
lynn
marries
as
some
day
he
will
you
will
be
left
alone
you
and
margaret
can
make
a
home
together
the
girl
face
was
hidden
in
her
hands
and
her
shoulders
shook
with
sobs
do
dearie
pleaded
aunt
peace
gently
be
my
brave
girl
look
up
at
me
and
smile
do
dearie
please
do
i
have
left
you
enough
to
make
you
comfortable
she
went
on
after
a
little
but
not
enough
to
be
a
care
to
you
nor
to
make
you
the
prey
of
fortune
hunters
it
is
i
think
securely
invested
and
you
will
have
the
income
while
you
live
some
few
keepsakes
are
yours
also
they
are
written
down
in
here
she
hesitated
in
a
paper
doctor
brinkerhoff
has
he
has
been
very
good
to
us
dearie
he
is
almost
your
for
he
was
with
me
when
i
found
you
he
is
a
gentleman
she
said
with
something
of
her
old
spirit
though
he
has
no
social
position
social
position
is
not
much
aunt
peace
beside
the
things
that
really
count
do
you
think
it
is
i
hardly
know
dearie
but
i
have
changed
my
mind
about
a
great
many
things
since
i
have
lain
here
i
was
never
ill
before
in
all
my
years
i
have
never
been
ill
more
than
a
day
at
a
time
and
it
seems
very
hard
it
is
hard
aunt
peace
but
we
hope
you
will
soon
be
well
no
dearie
she
answered
i
afraid
not
but
do
not
let
us
borrow
trouble
and
let
me
tell
you
something
to
remember
when
you
have
the
heartache
dearie
here
the
old
eyes
looked
trustfully
into
the
younger
ones
do
forget
that
you
made
me
happy
you
have
filled
my
days
with
sunshine
and
more
than
anything
else
you
have
kept
me
young
i
know
you
thought
me
harsh
at
first
but
now
i
am
sure
you
understand
you
have
been
my
own
dear
daughter
iris
if
you
had
been
my
own
flesh
and
blood
you
could
not
have
been
more
to
me
than
you
have
margaret
came
in
and
iris
went
away
sobbing
bitterly
aunt
peace
sighed
heavily
her
cheeks
were
scarlet
and
her
eyes
burned
like
stars
i
afraid
you
tired
yourself
said
margaret
softly
was
i
gone
too
long
no
indeed
iris
has
been
with
me
and
i
am
better
try
to
sleep
said
margaret
soothingly
obediently
aunt
peace
closed
her
eyes
but
presently
she
sat
up
so
warm
she
said
fretfully
where
is
doctor
brinkerhoff
he
has
not
come
yet
but
i
think
he
will
be
here
soon
margaret
yes
aunt
peace
will
you
write
off
the
recipe
for
those
little
cakes
for
him
he
may
be
able
to
find
someone
to
make
them
for
him
though
of
course
they
will
not
be
the
same
yes
i
will
it
in
my
book
they
are
called
brinkerhoff
cakes
you
will
not
forget
no
i
wo
forget
ca
you
sleep
now
i
try
presently
the
deep
regular
breathing
told
that
she
was
asleep
iris
came
back
with
her
eyes
swollen
and
margaret
took
her
out
into
the
hall
they
sat
there
for
a
long
time
hand
in
hand
waiting
but
no
sound
came
from
the
other
room
i
can
not
bear
it
moaned
iris
her
mouth
quivering
i
can
not
bear
to
have
aunt
peace
die
life
has
many
meanings
said
margaret
but
it
is
what
we
make
it
after
all
the
pendulum
swings
from
daylight
to
darkness
from
sun
to
storm
but
the
balance
is
always
true
iris
leaned
against
her
insensibly
comforted
she
would
be
the
first
to
tell
you
not
to
grieve
margaret
went
on
though
her
voice
faltered
and
still
we
need
sorrow
as
the
world
needs
night
we
can
not
always
live
in
the
sun
we
can
take
what
comes
to
us
bravely
as
gentlewomen
should
but
we
must
take
it
dear
there
is
no
other
way
long
afterward
iris
remembered
the
look
on
margaret
face
as
she
said
it
but
the
tears
blinded
her
just
then
doctor
brinkerhoff
came
back
at
twilight
anxious
and
worn
yet
eager
to
do
his
share
through
the
night
he
watched
with
her
alert
capable
and
unselfish
putting
aside
his
personal
grief
for
the
sake
of
the
others
in
the
last
days
those
two
had
grown
very
near
together
when
the
dreams
came
he
held
her
in
his
arms
until
the
tempest
passed
and
afterwards
soothed
her
to
sleep
doctor
she
said
one
day
i
have
been
thinking
a
great
deal
while
i
have
lain
here
i
seem
never
to
have
had
the
time
before
i
think
it
is
well
at
the
end
to
have
a
little
space
of
calm
for
one
sees
so
much
more
clearly
you
have
always
seen
clearly
dear
lady
said
the
doctor
very
gently
not
always
she
answered
shaking
her
head
i
can
see
many
a
mistake
now
the
fogs
have
sometimes
gathered
thick
about
me
but
now
they
have
lifted
forever
we
are
but
ships
on
the
sea
of
life
she
went
on
my
course
has
lain
through
calm
waters
for
the
most
part
with
the
skies
blue
and
fair
above
me
i
have
been
sheltered
and
i
can
see
now
that
it
might
have
made
me
stronger
and
better
to
face
some
of
the
storms
still
my
captain
knows
and
now
when
i
can
hear
the
breakers
booming
on
the
reef
where
i
am
to
strike
my
colours
i
am
not
afraid
the
end
came
on
sunday
just
at
sunset
while
the
bells
were
tolling
for
the
vesper
service
the
crescent
moon
rocked
idly
in
the
west
and
a
star
glimmered
faintly
above
it
sunset
and
evening
star
she
repeated
softly
and
one
clear
call
for
me
will
you
say
the
rest
of
it
choking
doctor
brinkerhoff
went
on
with
the
poem
until
he
reached
the
last
verse
when
he
could
speak
no
more
for
though
from
out
our
bourne
of
time
and
place
the
flood
may
bear
me
far
i
hope
to
meet
my
pilot
face
to
face
when
i
have
crossed
the
bar
she
finished
it
then
turned
to
him
with
her
face
illumined
it
is
beautiful
she
said
is
it
not
my
friend
twilight
came
and
margaret
found
them
there
when
she
went
in
with
a
lighted
candle
the
doctor
sat
at
the
side
of
the
bed
very
stiff
and
straight
with
the
tears
streaming
over
his
wrinkled
face
on
his
shoulder
like
a
tired
child
lay
aunt
peace
who
had
put
on
at
last
her
necklace
of
perfect
joy
xii
the
false
line
up
in
the
darkened
chamber
where
aunt
peace
lay
iris
stood
face
to
face
with
the
greatest
sorrow
of
her
life
was
this
then
the
end
was
there
nothing
more
cold
as
snow
unpitying
as
marble
death
mocked
iris
as
she
stood
there
mutely
questioning
timidly
she
touched
the
waxen
cheek
the
crimson
fires
burned
there
no
more
the
fever
was
gone
through
the
house
resounded
the
steady
tread
of
muffled
feet
of
all
the
horrors
of
death
the
worst
is
that
seemingly
endless
procession
who
come
to
offer
sympathy
to
ask
if
there
is
anything
they
can
do
mere
acquaintances
privileged
only
by
a
casual
nod
break
down
all
barriers
when
the
conqueror
comes
is
it
that
idle
curiosity
which
occasionally
dominates
the
best
of
us
or
is
it
life
triumphant
for
the
moment
looking
forward
fearfully
to
its
inevitable
end
some
friend
of
the
family
high
in
its
confidence
assumes
the
responsibility
at
such
times
chance
callers
are
rewarded
with
grisly
details
and
grewsome
descriptions
of
the
soul
struggling
to
free
itself
from
its
bonds
we
are
told
how
the
others
took
it
when
at
last
the
sail
was
spread
for
the
voyage
over
the
uncharted
sea
in
the
hall
straight
as
a
soldier
under
orders
stood
doctor
brinkerhoff
no
madam
he
would
say
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
the
arrangements
are
made
i
will
tell
irving
and
miss
temple
that
you
called
yes
we
were
expecting
it
she
died
peacefully
there
was
no
pain
at
four
and
then
again
thank
you
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
but
it
is
kind
of
you
to
offer
the
ladies
will
be
grateful
for
your
sympathy
who
shall
i
say
called
iris
pleaded
margaret
come
away
the
girl
started
i
ca
she
answered
dully
you
must
come
dear
come
into
my
room
unwillingly
iris
suffered
herself
to
be
led
away
it
is
only
the
surface
emotion
which
is
relieved
by
tears
within
the
of
the
soul
when
grief
clad
in
grey
garments
enters
silently
and
prepares
to
remain
there
is
no
weeping
one
hides
it
as
the
spartan
covered
the
bleeding
wound
in
his
breast
dear
said
margaret
my
heart
aches
for
you
she
was
all
i
had
whispered
iris
but
not
all
you
have
lynn
and
i
and
doctor
brinkerhoff
surely
we
are
something
did
you
ever
care
asked
iris
her
despairing
eyes
fixed
upon
margaret
the
older
woman
shrank
from
the
question
she
was
tempted
to
dissemble
but
one
tells
the
truth
in
the
presence
of
death
not
as
you
care
she
answered
my
mother
broke
my
heart
she
took
me
away
from
the
man
i
loved
and
forced
me
to
marry
another
whom
i
only
respected
when
my
husband
died
i
had
my
freedom
but
it
came
too
late
when
my
mother
died
she
died
unforgiven
then
you
do
understand
yes
dear
i
understand
you
must
remember
that
i
loved
her
too
suppose
it
had
been
lynn
lynn
cried
margaret
with
her
lips
white
lynn
dear
god
no
iris
laughed
hysterically
you
do
not
understand
she
said
with
forced
calmness
but
you
would
if
it
were
lynn
you
would
not
let
me
keep
you
away
if
it
were
lynn
instead
of
aunt
peace
so
please
do
not
disturb
me
again
back
she
went
into
the
darkened
chamber
and
closed
the
door
lynn
walked
back
and
forth
through
the
halls
aimlessly
all
along
he
had
felt
the
repulsion
of
the
healthy
young
animal
for
the
aged
and
now
he
was
unmoved
save
by
the
dank
sweet
smell
of
the
house
of
death
it
grated
on
his
sensibilities
and
made
him
shudder
he
wished
that
it
was
over
from
his
mother
he
felt
a
curious
alienation
her
eyes
were
red
and
lynn
hated
tears
from
doctor
brinkerhoff
too
a
gulf
divided
him
his
fingers
itched
for
his
violin
but
he
could
not
practise
it
would
not
disturb
aunt
peace
but
it
would
be
considered
out
of
keeping
with
the
situation
the
doctor
rooms
over
the
were
also
impossible
he
smiled
at
the
thought
of
the
gossip
which
would
permeate
east
lancaster
if
he
should
practise
there
but
at
herr
kaufmann
his
face
brightened
and
with
characteristic
impulsiveness
he
hastened
downstairs
doctor
brinkerhoff
still
stood
in
the
hall
a
little
wearily
perhaps
but
calmness
overlaid
his
features
like
a
mask
lynn
wondered
at
the
change
in
him
irving
he
said
huskily
you
were
going
out
yes
replied
lynn
to
herr
kaufmann
i
can
do
nothing
here
he
added
by
way
of
apology
no
sighed
the
doctor
no
one
can
do
anything
here
but
wait
one
moment
yes
responded
lynn
with
a
rising
inflection
is
there
some
message
it
is
my
message
said
the
doctor
with
dignity
say
to
him
please
that
no
provision
has
been
made
for
music
and
that
i
would
like
him
to
come
be
sure
to
say
that
i
ask
it
very
well
lynn
moved
away
from
the
house
decorously
though
the
freedom
of
the
outer
air
and
the
spring
of
the
turf
beneath
his
feet
lifted
the
cloud
from
his
spirits
and
urged
him
to
hasten
his
steps
doctor
brinkerhoff
looked
after
him
his
old
eyes
dim
the
impassable
chasm
of
the
years
lay
between
him
and
lynn
a
measureless
gulf
which
no
trick
of
magic
might
span
if
i
had
it
to
do
over
said
the
doctor
to
himself
if
i
had
my
lost
youth
and
was
not
afraid
things
would
not
be
as
they
are
now
margaret
saw
him
from
her
upper
window
and
something
tightened
round
her
heart
as
though
some
iron
hand
held
it
unpityingly
then
came
a
great
throb
of
relief
because
it
was
aunt
peace
instead
of
lynn
iris
too
had
seen
him
as
he
left
the
house
she
perceived
that
he
was
eager
to
get
away
that
only
a
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
kept
him
from
running
and
whistling
as
was
his
wont
from
the
first
she
had
known
that
it
was
nothing
to
him
he
has
no
heart
she
said
to
herself
he
is
as
cold
as
as
cold
as
aunt
peace
is
now
slow
torture
held
the
girl
in
a
remorseless
gird
dimly
she
knew
that
some
day
there
would
be
a
change
that
it
could
not
always
be
like
this
sometime
it
must
ease
and
each
throb
would
be
sensibly
less
of
a
hurt
just
a
little
easier
to
bear
with
rare
prescience
also
she
knew
that
nothing
in
the
world
would
ever
be
the
same
again
that
she
had
come
to
the
dividing
line
one
reaches
it
as
a
child
one
crosses
it
a
woman
no
said
the
doctor
for
the
fiftieth
time
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
irving
and
miss
temple
are
not
receiving
yes
we
expected
it
the
end
was
very
peaceful
and
she
did
not
suffer
at
all
yes
it
is
surely
a
comfort
to
know
that
the
arrangements
are
all
made
yes
thank
you
we
have
the
music
provided
for
it
was
kind
of
you
to
come
and
the
ladies
will
be
grateful
for
your
sympathy
who
shall
i
say
called
behind
him
were
the
portraits
ranged
in
orderly
rows
some
were
old
and
others
young
but
all
had
gone
the
way
that
peace
should
go
dumbly
the
doctor
wondered
if
the
same
remorseless
questioning
had
gone
on
every
time
there
had
been
a
death
in
the
old
house
and
if
so
why
the
very
floors
did
not
cry
out
in
protest
at
the
desecration
life
that
mystery
of
mysteries
the
silence
at
the
end
and
the
beginning
is
far
easier
to
understand
than
the
rainbow
that
arches
between
man
the
epitome
of
his
forbears
more
than
that
the
epitome
of
creation
stands
by
himself
the
riddle
of
the
universe
the
house
in
some
way
seemed
alive
in
pitiful
contrast
to
its
mistress
who
lay
upstairs
spending
her
last
night
in
the
virginal
whiteness
of
her
chamber
there
and
night
doctor
brinkerhoff
unable
to
bear
the
thought
recoiled
as
if
from
an
unexpected
blow
was
it
fancy
or
did
the
painted
lips
of
the
young
officer
in
the
uniform
of
the
colonies
part
in
an
ironical
smile
so
said
the
master
as
he
opened
the
door
you
are
late
to
your
lesson
it
is
my
lesson
day
is
it
returned
lynn
but
i
have
only
come
to
practise
my
aunt
is
dead
so
your
aunt
yes
aunt
peace
miss
field
you
know
he
continued
in
explanation
so
i
did
not
know
when
was
it
sunday
afternoon
and
this
is
tuesday
well
we
hear
very
little
up
here
it
is
too
bad
yes
agreed
lynn
awkwardly
it
it
upsets
things
the
master
looked
at
him
narrowly
so
it
does
for
instance
you
have
lost
one
lesson
on
account
of
it
but
you
can
practise
come
down
in
mine
shop
where
i
am
finishing
mine
violin
you
shall
play
your
concerto
it
is
not
a
necessity
to
lose
the
practise
for
death
that
what
i
thought
said
lynn
as
they
went
downstairs
she
was
very
old
you
know
more
than
there
is
a
great
deal
of
fuss
made
about
such
things
again
the
master
looked
at
him
sharply
but
lynn
was
unconscious
and
perfectly
sincere
he
was
not
touched
at
all
you
can
have
one
of
mine
violins
the
master
resumed
and
i
shall
finish
the
one
upon
which
i
am
at
work
the
concerto
please
at
once
lynn
began
walking
back
and
forth
restlessly
as
he
played
he
had
long
since
memorised
the
composition
and
when
he
finished
the
first
movement
he
paused
to
tighten
a
string
you
said
the
master
you
have
studied
composition
only
a
little
you
feel
no
gift
in
that
line
no
not
at
all
it
is
only
to
play
yes
for
the
present
then
said
the
master
changing
the
position
of
the
bridge
on
the
violin
in
his
hand
if
you
have
no
talents
for
composition
why
do
you
not
let
the
composer
of
your
concerto
have
his
own
way
you
should
not
correct
him
it
is
most
impolite
what
what
do
you
mean
stammered
lynn
nothing
said
the
master
only
if
you
have
no
gifts
you
should
play
g
sharp
where
it
is
written
instead
of
g
natural
it
is
not
what
one
might
call
an
improvement
in
the
concerto
lynn
flushed
and
began
to
play
the
movement
over
again
but
before
he
reached
the
bar
in
question
he
had
forgotten
when
he
came
to
it
he
played
g
natural
again
and
instantly
perceived
his
mistake
the
master
laughed
genius
he
said
must
have
its
own
way
it
is
not
to
be
held
down
by
the
written
score
it
must
make
changes
flourishes
improvements
it
is
one
pity
that
the
composer
can
not
know
i
forgot
temporised
lynn
so
then
why
not
take
up
the
parlour
organ
you
should
have
an
instrument
on
which
the
notes
are
all
made
i
should
not
advise
the
banjo
or
even
the
concertina
the
organ
that
turns
by
the
handle
would
be
better
yet
to
make
the
notes
that
is
most
difficult
is
it
not
so
now
then
the
adagio
let
us
see
how
much
you
can
better
that
lynn
played
it
correctly
and
with
intelligence
but
without
feeling
one
moment
said
the
master
there
is
something
i
do
not
understand
that
adagio
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
things
ever
written
it
is
full
of
one
heartache
and
has
in
it
many
tears
your
aunt
you
say
lies
dead
in
your
house
and
yet
you
play
it
like
one
machine
i
can
not
see
perhaps
you
had
quarrelled
no
returned
lynn
in
astonishment
i
was
very
very
fond
of
her
there
was
a
long
silence
then
the
master
sighed
the
thing
means
more
than
the
person
he
said
whoever
is
dead
if
it
is
only
one
little
bird
it
should
make
you
feel
sad
but
it
waits
before
you
have
finished
the
world
will
do
one
of
three
things
to
you
it
will
make
your
heart
very
soft
very
hard
or
else
break
it
so
no
one
escapes
by
the
way
began
lynn
eager
to
change
the
subject
doctor
brinkerhoff
told
me
to
ask
you
to
come
and
play
at
the
funeral
at
four
he
said
it
was
his
wish
the
master
face
was
troubled
once
he
said
i
promised
one
very
angry
lady
that
i
would
not
go
in
that
house
again
and
i
have
kept
mine
word
it
was
only
once
i
went
but
that
was
too
much
still
it
was
years
and
more
past
and
she
has
long
since
been
dead
death
frees
one
from
a
promise
is
it
not
so
of
course
replied
lynn
vaguely
at
any
rate
mine
friend
the
herr
doctor
has
asked
it
even
after
he
has
known
of
mine
promise
and
of
a
surety
he
is
wiser
than
i
will
come
at
four
with
mine
violin
lynn
took
the
long
way
home
his
sunny
nature
deeply
disturbed
what
is
it
he
vainly
asked
of
himself
am
i
different
from
everybody
else
they
all
seem
to
know
something
that
i
do
not
iris
kept
her
long
vigil
by
aunt
peace
her
grief
too
great
for
her
starved
body
to
withstand
at
the
sound
of
a
fall
doctor
brinkerhoff
left
his
post
and
hurried
upstairs
margaret
was
there
almost
as
soon
as
he
was
iris
had
fainted
together
they
carried
her
into
her
own
room
where
at
length
she
revived
what
happened
she
asked
weakly
did
i
fall
hush
dear
said
margaret
lie
still
i
coming
to
sit
with
you
after
a
while
she
went
out
into
the
hall
to
speak
to
the
doctor
but
he
was
not
there
by
instinct
she
knew
where
to
find
him
and
went
into
the
front
room
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
door
looking
down
upon
that
marble
face
margaret
was
beside
him
before
he
knew
of
her
presence
and
when
he
turned
for
once
off
his
guard
she
read
his
secret
she
never
knew
he
said
briefly
as
though
in
explanation
i
never
dared
to
tell
her
sometimes
i
think
the
lines
we
draw
are
false
ones
that
god
knows
best
yes
replied
margaret
unsteadily
the
lines
are
false
but
it
is
always
too
late
when
we
find
it
out
yet
a
part
of
the
barrier
was
of
his
own
making
she
was
infinitely
above
me
i
should
have
been
her
slave
i
was
never
meant
to
be
her
equal
still
the
thirsty
heart
will
aspire
to
the
waters
beyond
its
reach
she
knows
now
said
margaret
yes
she
knows
now
and
she
pardons
me
for
my
presumption
i
can
read
it
in
her
face
as
i
stand
here
margaret
choked
back
a
sob
come
away
she
said
with
her
hand
upon
his
arm
come
away
until
until
he
repeated
softly
he
closed
the
door
quietly
as
though
he
feared
the
sound
might
break
her
sleep
iris
was
resting
and
margaret
tiptoed
down
into
the
parlour
where
the
doctor
sat
with
his
grey
head
bowed
upon
his
hands
she
knows
it
now
he
said
again
and
she
forgives
me
i
can
feel
it
in
my
heart
if
she
had
known
it
before
said
margaret
things
would
have
been
different
but
she
knew
that
what
she
said
was
untrue
no
he
returned
shaking
his
head
the
line
was
there
you
would
not
know
what
it
is
like
unless
there
had
been
a
line
between
you
and
the
one
you
loved
there
was
she
answered
hoarsely
then
her
eyes
met
his
you
too
he
asked
unbelieving
but
she
could
not
speak
she
only
bowed
her
head
in
assent
then
his
hand
grasped
hers
in
full
understanding
the
false
line
divided
them
also
but
in
one
thing
at
least
they
were
kindred
i
wish
said
the
doctor
after
a
little
that
we
could
hide
her
away
before
the
people
she
has
held
herself
apart
from
all
her
life
will
come
and
look
at
her
now
that
she
is
helpless
that
is
the
irony
of
it
returned
margaret
i
have
even
prayed
to
outlive
those
i
hated
so
that
they
could
not
come
and
look
at
me
when
i
was
dead
have
you
outlived
them
yes
answered
margaret
thickly
every
one
you
hated
someone
who
drew
the
false
line
yes
and
that
person
is
dead
yes
then
said
the
doctor
very
gently
when
you
have
forgiven
the
line
will
be
blotted
out
the
one
on
the
other
side
of
it
may
be
out
of
your
reach
forever
but
the
line
will
be
gone
the
idea
was
new
to
her
that
she
must
forgive
she
thought
of
it
long
afterward
when
the
house
was
as
quiet
as
its
sleeping
mistress
and
the
pale
stars
faded
to
pearl
at
the
hour
of
dawn
the
third
day
came
the
end
of
that
pitiful
period
in
which
we
wait
blindly
hoping
that
the
miracle
of
resurrection
may
be
given
once
more
and
the
stone
be
rolled
away
from
our
dead
it
was
doctor
brinkerhoff
who
had
the
casket
closed
before
the
strangers
came
and
afterward
he
told
margaret
she
would
be
thankful
margaret
assured
him
and
his
eyes
filled
yes
he
answered
huskily
i
believe
she
would
they
sat
together
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
out
of
sight
and
yet
within
hearing
lynn
sat
at
one
end
still
perplexed
and
shuddering
at
the
unpleasantness
of
it
all
his
mother
hand
was
in
his
and
with
her
left
arm
she
supported
iris
who
leaned
heavily
against
her
shoulder
on
the
other
side
of
iris
was
doctor
brinkerhoff
austere
and
alone
from
below
came
the
wonderful
words
of
the
burial
service
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
he
that
believeth
in
me
though
he
were
dead
yet
shall
he
live
it
was
followed
by
a
beautiful
tribute
to
aunt
peace
to
the
countless
good
deeds
of
her
five
and
seventy
years
then
there
was
silence
broken
by
the
muffled
sound
of
a
string
being
tightened
to
harmonise
with
the
piano
swiftly
upon
the
discordant
note
the
voice
of
a
violin
strong
clear
and
surpassingly
sweet
rose
in
an
margaret
started
to
her
feet
what
is
it
she
whispered
hoarsely
mother
said
lynn
in
a
low
tone
do
it
is
only
herr
kaufmann
we
asked
him
to
play
the
cremona
she
muttered
the
cremona
here
she
lay
back
in
her
chair
with
her
eyes
closed
and
her
mouth
quivering
lynn
held
her
hand
tightly
and
iris
breathed
hard
doctor
brinkerhoff
listened
intently
his
heart
rejoicing
in
the
beauty
of
it
because
it
was
done
for
her
deep
chords
full
and
splendid
sounded
an
ultimate
triumph
over
death
the
music
counselled
acceptance
resignation
because
of
something
that
lay
beyond
indefinite
yet
complete
restitution
when
the
time
of
its
fulfilment
should
be
at
hand
beside
it
the
individual
grief
sank
into
insignificance
it
was
the
sorrow
of
the
world
demanding
payment
for
itself
from
the
world
joy
something
vast
and
appealing
took
the
place
of
the
finite
passion
seeking
hungrily
for
its
own
ends
and
in
the
greatness
of
it
with
heart
uplifted
margaret
forgave
the
dead
xiii
to
iris
daughter
of
the
marshes
the
winds
have
told
me
you
are
sad
if
i
could
i
would
bear
it
for
you
but
there
is
no
way
by
which
one
of
us
may
take
another
burden
i
wish
i
might
come
to
you
but
now
when
you
are
troubled
i
will
not
ask
you
for
a
signal
even
for
a
flower
on
the
i
would
always
have
you
happy
dear
if
my
love
could
buy
it
from
the
fates
those
deep
eyes
of
yours
should
never
be
veiled
by
the
mist
of
tears
do
you
know
where
the
marsh
is
iris
you
have
lived
in
east
lancaster
for
many
years
so
the
gossips
tell
me
yet
i
doubt
whether
you
could
find
it
unless
someone
showed
you
the
way
to
reach
it
you
must
follow
the
river
through
all
its
turns
and
windings
for
many
a
weary
mile
up
in
those
distant
hills
so
far
that
i
have
never
found
it
the
river
begins
perhaps
in
some
tiny
pool
of
crystal
clearness
it
sings
along
over
its
rocky
bed
until
it
reaches
a
low
sandy
plain
and
here
is
the
marsh
i
was
there
the
other
day
just
at
sunset
my
heart
thrilled
with
the
beauty
of
it
because
it
is
the
beauty
of
you
how
shall
i
tell
you
of
the
wonder
of
the
marshes
those
wide
watery
plains
embroidered
with
strange
bloom
tall
slender
rushes
stand
there
bending
gracefully
when
the
wind
passes
and
answering
with
music
to
the
touch
have
you
ever
heard
the
song
of
the
marshes
when
the
wind
moves
through
the
rushes
and
plays
upon
them
like
strings
some
day
i
will
take
you
there
and
you
shall
listen
too
and
tell
me
what
you
think
it
means
here
and
there
are
pools
set
like
jewels
among
the
rushes
with
never
a
hint
of
growth
sometimes
you
see
a
wide
sweep
of
grass
starred
with
tiny
yellow
flowers
or
a
lily
surrounded
by
its
leaves
drinking
in
the
loveliness
of
the
day
and
forgetting
all
the
maze
of
slime
and
dark
water
through
which
it
has
somehow
come
i
think
our
souls
are
like
that
iris
we
grow
through
the
world
with
all
its
darkness
borne
upward
by
unfailing
aspiration
until
we
reach
the
end
which
we
have
been
taught
to
call
heaven
but
which
is
only
blossoming
in
the
light
but
of
all
the
radiant
beauty
of
marshes
the
best
is
this
that
part
of
it
which
bears
the
purple
flower
of
your
name
in
and
out
of
the
rushes
like
the
thread
of
a
strange
tapestry
it
winds
and
wanders
hidden
for
an
instant
maybe
but
never
lost
i
have
gathered
an
armful
of
the
blossoms
and
put
my
face
down
to
them
closing
my
eyes
and
dreaming
that
it
was
you
you
whom
i
must
ever
hold
apart
as
something
too
beautiful
for
me
to
touch
you
whom
i
can
only
love
from
afar
i
have
told
you
that
i
would
come
when
the
iris
bloomed
but
now
when
the
marsh
is
glorious
with
the
purple
banners
i
dare
not
it
is
not
only
because
you
are
sad
though
not
for
worlds
would
i
trouble
you
now
but
because
i
am
afraid
only
in
my
wildest
moments
do
i
dare
to
hope
you
were
never
meant
for
such
as
i
by
day
i
bow
my
soul
before
you
in
shame
at
my
own
unworthiness
but
at
night
like
some
flaming
star
which
speeds
across
the
uncharted
dark
you
light
the
barren
country
of
my
dreams
i
think
sometimes
that
i
shall
never
dare
to
tell
you
that
it
must
be
like
this
year
after
year
if
you
knew
your
lover
who
is
so
bold
and
yet
so
fearful
i
think
you
would
cast
him
aside
in
scorn
so
it
is
better
for
me
to
believe
though
that
belief
has
no
foundation
better
for
me
to
hope
than
utterly
to
despair
without
you
i
dare
not
think
what
life
might
be
like
the
marsh
the
years
stretch
out
before
me
a
vast
plain
of
which
the
uncertainty
only
is
sure
they
are
full
of
strange
pitfalls
of
unsounded
deeps
and
silences
of
impassable
barriers
which
i
disheartened
and
doubting
must
one
day
meet
face
to
face
night
lies
upon
it
and
i
can
not
see
the
way
storm
beats
upon
me
and
turns
me
from
my
course
the
clouded
day
ends
in
sunset
and
the
crystal
pools
by
which
i
thought
to
mark
my
path
become
beacons
of
flame
the
will
o
the
wisp
leads
me
into
the
mire
where
the
rushes
cling
tightly
about
me
and
keep
me
back
but
the
night
wind
blows
from
the
east
where
the
dawn
sleeps
and
on
the
strings
of
the
marsh
grass
breathes
a
little
song
iris
it
sings
then
all
at
once
my
sore
heart
grows
strangely
glad
for
whatever
may
come
to
me
i
shall
have
the
memory
of
you
like
the
flags
that
glorify
the
marshes
and
spread
their
elfin
sweetness
afar
you
shine
upon
the
desert
wastes
of
my
life
i
can
never
wholly
lose
you
you
are
there
for
always
and
graven
on
my
heart
forever
is
the
symbol
of
the
xiv
her
somehow
the
days
passed
iris
ate
mechanically
and
went
about
her
household
duties
with
her
former
precision
on
wednesday
evening
doctor
brinkerhoff
came
as
usual
and
margaret
eyes
filled
at
the
sight
of
him
bent
old
and
haggard
he
came
up
the
path
longing
for
his
accustomed
place
in
the
house
and
yet
dreading
to
take
it
iris
met
him
with
a
pitiful
little
smile
and
he
bowed
over
her
hand
for
a
moment
his
shoulders
shaking
then
he
straightened
himself
like
a
soldier
under
fire
miss
iris
he
said
we
are
bound
together
by
a
common
grief
more
than
that
i
have
a
trust
to
fulfil
she
here
he
hesitated
and
then
went
on
she
asked
me
if
i
would
not
try
to
take
the
place
of
a
father
to
you
and
i
promised
that
i
would
i
have
always
felt
so
toward
you
answered
iris
in
a
low
tone
lynn
was
quite
himself
again
and
his
cheerful
talk
enlivened
the
others
almost
against
their
will
there
was
laughter
and
to
spare
yet
beneath
it
was
an
undercurrent
of
sorrow
for
the
wound
was
healed
only
upon
the
surface
it
is
hard
said
the
doctor
sadly
but
life
holds
many
hard
things
for
all
of
us
perhaps
if
we
lived
rightly
if
our
faith
were
stronger
death
would
not
rend
our
hearts
as
it
does
it
is
the
common
lot
the
universal
leveller
and
soon
or
late
it
comes
to
us
all
it
remains
to
make
our
spiritual
adjustment
accord
with
the
inevitable
fact
there
is
so
little
that
we
can
change
that
it
behooves
us
to
confine
our
efforts
to
ourselves
life
replied
lynn
is
the
pitch
of
the
orchestra
and
we
are
the
instruments
doctor
brinkerhoff
nodded
very
true
the
discord
and
the
broken
string
of
the
individual
instrument
do
not
affect
the
whole
except
as
false
notes
but
i
think
that
god
knowing
all
things
must
discern
the
symphony
glorious
with
meaning
through
the
discordant
fragments
that
we
play
so
the
talk
went
on
lynn
taking
the
burden
of
it
and
endeavouring
always
to
make
it
cheerful
margaret
understood
and
loved
him
for
it
but
she
too
was
sad
iris
sat
like
a
stone
waiting
counting
off
the
leaden
hours
as
something
to
be
endured
and
blindly
believing
that
rest
would
come
everything
said
margaret
after
a
long
silence
was
as
beautiful
as
it
could
be
doctor
brinkerhoff
understood
at
once
yes
he
sighed
and
i
am
glad
i
think
it
was
as
she
would
have
wished
it
to
be
and
i
am
sure
she
was
pleased
because
i
shielded
her
from
the
gaze
of
the
curious
at
the
end
his
face
worked
as
he
said
it
but
he
took
a
pitiful
pride
in
what
he
had
done
day
by
day
he
hugged
this
last
service
closer
because
it
was
done
through
his
own
thought
and
his
own
understanding
and
would
have
pleased
her
if
she
had
known
yes
returned
margaret
kindly
it
was
very
thoughtful
of
you
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
me
and
i
know
she
would
have
been
grateful
miss
iris
said
the
doctor
inquiringly
the
girl
turned
yes
she
she
gave
me
a
paper
for
you
will
you
have
it
or
shall
i
read
it
to
you
read
it
answered
iris
dully
it
is
in
the
form
of
a
letter
she
wrote
it
one
day
near
the
end
of
her
illness
and
gave
it
to
me
to
be
opened
after
her
death
in
the
midst
of
a
profound
silence
he
took
an
envelope
from
his
pocket
and
broke
the
seal
dear
doctor
brinkerhoff
he
began
clearing
his
throat
feel
that
i
am
not
going
to
get
well
and
so
i
have
been
thinking
as
i
lie
here
and
setting
my
house
in
order
i
have
told
iris
but
for
fear
she
may
forget
i
tell
you
all
the
papers
which
concern
her
are
in
a
tin
box
in
a
trunk
in
the
attic
she
will
know
where
to
find
it
her
as
to
an
only
daughter
go
my
little
keepsakes
the
emerald
pin
my
few
pieces
of
real
lace
my
fan
and
the
silver
buckles
she
will
understand
the
spirit
of
this
bequest
and
will
feel
free
to
take
what
she
likes
house
is
for
margaret
and
after
her
for
lynn
but
it
is
to
be
a
home
for
iris
just
as
it
has
been
while
she
lives
her
income
is
to
be
paid
regularly
on
the
first
of
every
month
during
her
lifetime
as
is
written
in
my
will
which
the
lawyer
has
and
which
he
will
read
at
the
proper
time
my
little
girl
that
though
i
am
dead
i
love
her
still
that
she
has
given
me
more
than
i
could
ever
have
given
her
and
that
she
must
be
my
brave
girl
and
not
grieve
tell
her
i
want
her
to
be
happy
you
i
send
my
parting
salutations
i
have
appreciated
your
friendship
and
your
professional
skill
assurances
of
my
deep
personal
esteem
friend
field
iris
broke
down
and
left
the
room
weeping
bitterly
margaret
followed
her
but
the
girl
pushed
her
aside
no
she
whispered
go
back
it
is
better
for
me
to
be
alone
i
am
sorry
said
the
doctor
breaking
the
painful
hush
perhaps
i
should
have
waited
i
very
much
regret
having
given
miss
iris
unnecessary
pain
it
is
as
well
now
as
at
any
other
time
margaret
assured
him
but
my
heart
bleeds
for
her
the
clock
on
the
landing
struck
ten
and
margaret
excused
herself
for
a
moment
she
returned
with
the
royal
worcester
plate
piled
with
cakes
and
a
decanter
of
the
port
i
made
them
she
said
in
a
low
tone
she
asked
me
to
give
you
the
recipe
she
was
always
thoughtful
of
others
returned
the
doctor
choking
he
filled
his
glass
and
from
force
of
habit
offered
it
to
an
invisible
friend
to
your
then
he
stopped
to
her
memory
sobbed
margaret
touching
his
glass
with
hers
they
drank
the
toast
in
silence
then
the
doctor
staggered
to
his
feet
i
can
bear
no
more
he
said
unsteadily
it
is
a
communion
service
with
the
dead
lynn
said
margaret
after
the
guest
had
gone
i
am
troubled
about
iris
she
is
grieving
herself
to
death
and
it
is
not
natural
for
the
young
to
suffer
acutely
for
so
long
can
you
suggest
anything
no
answered
lynn
anxious
in
his
turn
except
to
get
outdoors
i
do
believe
she
been
out
since
aunt
peace
was
buried
you
must
take
her
then
do
you
think
she
would
go
with
me
i
do
know
dear
but
try
it
try
it
take
her
for
a
long
walk
and
get
her
so
tired
that
she
will
sleep
nothing
rests
the
mind
like
fatigue
of
the
body
mother
began
lynn
after
a
little
are
we
always
going
to
stay
in
east
lancaster
i
have
thought
about
it
at
all
lynn
are
you
becoming
discontented
no
i
was
only
looking
ahead
this
is
our
home
aunt
peace
has
given
it
to
us
it
was
ours
anyway
was
it
in
a
way
it
was
but
your
grandfather
left
it
to
aunt
peace
if
he
had
not
died
suddenly
he
would
have
changed
his
will
mother
said
he
intended
to
but
he
kept
putting
it
off
do
you
want
me
to
keep
on
studying
the
violin
margaret
looked
up
in
surprise
but
lynn
was
pacing
back
and
forth
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
and
his
head
down
why
not
dear
she
asked
very
gently
well
he
sighed
i
do
believe
i
ever
going
to
make
anything
of
it
of
course
i
can
play
herr
kaufmann
says
if
it
satisfies
me
to
play
the
music
as
it
is
written
he
can
teach
me
that
much
but
he
has
a
very
good
opinion
of
me
i
rather
be
a
carpenter
than
a
violinist
and
i
it
time
i
was
choosing
margaret
heart
misgave
her
but
she
spoke
bravely
lynn
look
at
me
he
turned
and
his
eyes
met
hers
openly
and
unashamed
tell
me
the
truth
do
you
want
to
be
an
artist
mother
i
rather
be
an
artist
than
anything
else
in
the
world
then
dear
keep
at
it
and
do
get
discouraged
somebody
said
once
that
the
only
reason
for
a
failure
was
that
the
desire
to
succeed
was
not
strong
enough
lynn
laughed
mirthlessly
if
that
is
so
he
said
moodily
i
shall
not
fail
no
she
answered
you
shall
not
fail
i
wo
let
you
fail
she
added
impulsively
i
know
you
and
i
believe
in
you
the
worst
of
it
lynn
went
on
would
be
to
disappoint
you
margaret
drew
his
tall
head
down
and
rubbed
her
cheek
against
his
you
could
not
disappoint
me
she
said
serenely
for
all
i
ask
of
you
is
your
best
give
me
that
and
i
am
satisfied
you
always
had
that
mother
he
returned
with
a
forced
laugh
when
you
strike
a
snag
i
suppose
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
drive
on
so
we
let
it
go
at
that
i
keep
on
and
do
the
best
i
can
if
worst
comes
to
worst
i
can
play
in
a
theatre
orchestra
do
cried
margaret
you
never
have
to
do
that
well
sighed
lynn
you
can
never
tell
what
coming
and
in
the
meantime
it
almost
twelve
with
the
happy
faculty
of
youth
lynn
was
asleep
almost
as
soon
as
his
head
touched
the
pillow
iris
lay
with
her
eyes
wide
open
staring
into
the
dark
inert
and
helpless
under
the
influence
of
that
anodyne
which
comes
at
the
end
of
a
hurt
simply
through
lack
of
the
power
to
suffer
more
the
three
letters
under
her
pillow
brought
a
certain
sense
of
comfort
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
which
surrounded
her
someone
knew
someone
understood
loved
her
and
was
content
to
wait
margaret
was
troubled
because
of
lynn
disbelief
in
himself
his
sunny
was
apparently
put
to
rout
by
this
new
phase
then
she
remembered
that
they
had
all
passed
through
a
time
of
stress
that
lynn
strong
and
as
he
had
been
must
have
felt
it
too
and
moreover
the
artistic
temperament
in
itself
was
inclined
to
various
eccentricities
of
his
future
she
never
for
one
moment
had
any
doubt
it
was
her
heart
desire
that
lynn
should
be
an
artist
looking
back
upon
her
life
and
upon
all
that
she
had
suffered
she
saw
this
one
boon
as
full
compensation
as
her
just
due
if
this
bone
of
her
bone
and
flesh
of
her
flesh
might
wear
the
laurel
crown
of
the
great
she
would
be
content
would
not
begrudge
the
price
which
she
had
paid
for
it
she
smiled
ironically
at
the
thought
that
while
credit
was
given
to
some
she
had
been
compelled
to
pay
in
advance
it
does
not
matter
she
mused
we
must
all
pay
and
it
may
be
all
the
sweeter
because
i
know
that
no
further
payment
will
be
demanded
she
was
thinking
of
it
when
she
fell
asleep
and
in
her
dream
she
stood
at
a
counter
with
a
great
throng
of
people
pushing
and
jostling
behind
the
counter
was
one
in
the
form
of
a
man
who
appeared
to
be
an
angel
his
face
was
serene
and
calm
he
seemed
far
removed
from
the
passions
which
swayed
the
multitude
he
conducted
his
business
without
hurry
or
fret
and
all
the
pushing
availed
nothing
his
voice
was
clear
and
high
and
had
in
it
a
sense
of
finality
no
one
questioned
him
though
many
went
away
grumbling
you
have
come
to
buy
wealth
he
asked
we
have
it
for
sale
but
the
price
of
it
is
your
peace
of
mind
for
knowledge
we
ask
human
sympathy
if
you
take
much
of
it
you
lose
the
capacity
to
feel
with
your
fellow
men
if
you
take
beauty
you
must
give
up
your
right
to
love
and
take
the
risk
of
an
ignoble
passion
in
its
place
if
you
want
fame
you
must
pay
the
price
of
eternal
loneliness
for
love
you
must
give
and
take
the
hurts
of
it
without
complaining
for
health
you
pay
in
and
right
living
yes
you
may
take
what
you
like
and
the
bill
will
be
collected
later
but
there
is
no
exchange
and
you
must
buy
something
take
as
long
as
you
wish
to
choose
but
you
must
buy
and
you
must
pay
margaret
awoke
with
his
voice
thundering
in
her
ears
you
must
buy
and
you
must
pay
the
dream
was
extraordinarily
vivid
and
it
seemed
as
though
someone
shared
it
with
her
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
it
had
not
actually
happened
i
have
bought
she
said
to
herself
and
i
have
paid
now
it
only
remains
for
me
to
enjoy
lynn
triumph
he
will
not
have
to
pay
his
mother
has
paid
for
him
at
breakfast
iris
was
more
like
herself
and
lynn
was
in
good
spirits
i
dreamed
all
night
he
said
cheerily
and
one
dream
kept
coming
back
i
was
buying
something
somewhere
and
refusing
to
pay
for
it
and
there
was
a
row
about
it
i
insisted
that
the
thing
was
paid
for
i
do
know
what
it
was
but
it
was
something
i
wanted
we
always
pay
said
iris
sadly
but
i
ca
help
wondering
what
i
am
paying
for
now
perhaps
suggested
margaret
you
are
paying
in
advance
iris
brightened
and
upon
her
face
came
the
ghost
of
a
smile
that
may
be
she
answered
iris
asked
lynn
will
you
go
out
with
me
this
afternoon
you
have
been
for
a
long
time
i
do
think
so
she
replied
dully
it
is
kind
of
you
but
i
not
very
strong
just
now
we
walk
slowly
lynn
assured
her
and
it
will
do
you
good
you
come
just
to
please
me
his
voice
was
very
tender
and
iris
sighed
i
see
she
said
resignedly
i
do
care
what
i
do
at
three
then
said
lynn
i
get
through
practising
by
that
time
and
i
be
waiting
for
you
at
the
appointed
time
they
started
and
margaret
waved
her
hand
at
them
as
they
went
down
the
path
iris
was
so
thin
and
fragile
that
it
seemed
as
if
any
passing
wind
might
blow
her
away
lynn
was
very
careful
and
considerate
where
do
you
want
to
go
he
asked
i
do
care
i
do
want
to
climb
though
let
keep
on
level
ground
very
well
but
where
which
way
iris
felt
the
stiff
corner
of
the
letter
hidden
in
her
gown
let
go
up
the
river
she
said
i
never
been
there
and
i
like
to
go
so
they
followed
the
course
of
the
stream
and
the
fresh
air
brought
a
faint
colour
into
her
cheeks
as
the
giant
of
old
gained
strength
from
his
mother
earth
iris
revived
in
the
sunshine
the
long
period
of
inactivity
demanded
exertion
to
balance
it
it
is
lovely
she
said
it
seems
good
to
be
moving
around
again
i
take
you
every
day
returned
lynn
if
you
only
come
i
want
to
see
you
happy
again
i
shall
never
be
as
happy
as
i
was
she
sighed
no
one
is
the
same
after
a
sorrow
like
mine
i
suppose
not
answered
lynn
we
are
always
changing
no
one
can
go
back
of
and
be
the
same
as
he
was
yesterday
i
often
think
that
old
greek
philosopher
was
right
when
he
said
that
the
one
thing
common
to
all
life
was
change
which
one
was
he
heraclitus
i
think
anyhow
he
was
a
clever
old
duck
iris
smiled
i
have
sometimes
thought
ducks
were
philosophers
she
said
but
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
philosophers
were
ducks
lynn
laughed
heartily
thoroughly
pleased
with
himself
because
iris
seemed
so
much
better
we
do
want
to
go
too
far
he
said
i
would
tire
you
for
anything
shall
we
go
back
no
not
yet
is
there
a
marsh
up
here
somewhere
i
should
think
there
would
be
then
let
keep
on
and
see
if
we
do
find
it
i
feel
as
though
i
were
exploring
a
new
country
it
strange
that
i
never
been
here
before
is
it
it
because
i
was
here
to
take
you
but
you
always
have
me
now
you
and
i
and
mother
are
all
going
to
live
together
wo
that
be
nice
yes
answered
iris
but
her
voice
sounded
far
away
and
her
eyes
filled
late
afternoon
flooded
the
earth
with
gold
and
from
distant
fields
came
the
drowsy
hum
and
whir
of
the
fairy
folk
with
melodious
wings
the
birds
sang
cheerily
butterflies
floated
in
the
fragrant
air
and
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
in
all
the
world
there
was
such
a
thing
as
death
i
not
going
to
let
you
go
any
farther
said
lynn
you
be
tired
no
i
wo
and
besides
i
want
to
see
the
marsh
my
dear
girl
you
could
see
it
you
could
only
stand
on
the
edge
of
it
well
i
stand
on
the
edge
of
it
then
said
iris
stubbornly
come
this
far
and
i
going
to
see
it
suppose
we
climb
that
hill
yonder
suggested
lynn
it
overlooks
the
marsh
that
will
do
returned
iris
i
willing
to
climb
now
though
i
was
when
we
started
at
first
lynn
walked
by
her
side
warning
her
to
go
slowly
then
he
took
her
hand
to
help
her
when
they
reached
the
summit
he
had
his
arm
around
her
and
it
was
some
minutes
before
it
occurred
to
him
to
take
it
away
iris
was
looking
at
the
tapestry
spread
out
before
them
the
great
marsh
with
the
sunset
light
upon
it
and
the
swallows
circling
above
it
oh
she
whispered
with
her
face
alight
how
beautiful
it
is
see
all
the
purple
in
it
why
it
might
be
violets
from
up
here
yes
answered
lynn
dreamily
it
is
your
the
then
the
colour
flamed
in
his
face
and
he
bit
his
lips
quick
as
a
flash
iris
turned
upon
him
did
you
write
the
letters
she
demanded
lynn
eyes
met
hers
clearly
yes
he
said
very
tenderly
dear
heart
did
you
know
xv
little
lady
up
in
the
attic
iris
sat
beside
the
old
trunk
her
lap
filled
with
papers
never
had
she
felt
so
alone
so
desolate
as
the
rain
beat
upon
the
roof
and
grey
swirls
of
water
dashed
against
the
pane
the
old
house
rocked
in
the
rising
wind
and
from
below
like
an
eerie
accompaniment
came
the
sound
of
lynn
violin
he
was
practising
and
iris
heard
him
walking
back
and
forth
playing
with
mechanical
precision
she
shuddered
at
the
sound
of
it
for
strangely
enough
she
was
conscious
of
bitter
resentment
against
lynn
his
hand
had
destroyed
her
dream
and
levelled
it
to
the
dust
in
the
darkness
she
had
leaned
insensibly
upon
the
writer
of
the
letters
and
now
she
knew
that
it
was
only
lynn
lynn
who
had
no
heart
there
comes
a
time
to
most
of
us
when
the
single
prop
gives
way
and
absolutely
alone
we
either
stand
or
fall
in
the
hard
school
of
life
sooner
or
later
one
learns
iris
began
to
perceive
that
in
the
end
she
could
depend
upon
no
one
but
herself
with
a
sigh
she
turned
to
the
papers
once
more
there
was
the
report
of
the
detective
whom
aunt
peace
had
engaged
at
the
beginning
voluminous
and
obscured
by
legal
phrases
two
or
three
letters
bearing
upon
the
subject
were
attached
to
it
in
the
bottom
of
the
box
were
a
wide
showy
band
of
gold
which
presumably
had
been
her
mother
wedding
ring
and
two
photographs
one
was
of
a
man
whose
weakness
was
indelibly
stamped
upon
every
feature
the
low
narrow
forehead
the
eyes
slanting
inward
the
full
lips
and
receding
chin
on
the
back
of
it
aunt
peace
had
written
supposed
to
be
her
father
looking
at
it
iris
wondered
how
her
mother
could
have
cared
for
a
man
like
that
weak
and
frankly
sensuous
yet
there
was
an
air
of
gay
carelessness
about
the
picture
a
sort
of
friendly
distantly
related
to
those
genial
ways
which
stamp
a
higher
grade
of
man
as
a
good
fellow
over
the
other
photograph
she
lingered
long
the
first
iris
temple
was
pictured
in
the
panoply
of
a
stage
queen
the
crown
of
paste
brilliants
upon
her
head
the
tawdry
gown
elaborately
trimmed
with
tinsel
and
the
gilded
sceptre
were
all
discredited
by
the
face
beneath
its
mask
of
artificiality
was
a
woman
a
very
human
woman
impulsive
eager
and
loving
whose
trustful
eyes
looked
straight
at
iris
with
intimate
comprehension
plainly
the
life
of
the
stage
was
not
to
her
taste
she
hungered
as
every
normal
woman
hungers
for
the
quiet
hearthstone
and
the
simple
joys
of
home
in
all
her
dreams
of
her
mother
iris
had
never
imagined
her
like
this
and
yet
she
was
not
disappointed
at
times
looking
back
upon
her
miserable
childhood
she
had
bitterly
blamed
her
for
it
but
now
for
the
first
time
she
understood
poor
little
mother
said
iris
you
did
the
very
best
you
could
if
things
had
been
different
she
and
her
mother
could
have
had
a
little
home
of
their
own
rebellion
was
hot
in
the
girl
heart
when
she
suddenly
remembered
something
fräulein
fredrika
had
said
long
ago
wherever
one
may
be
that
is
the
best
place
the
dear
god
knows
she
folded
up
the
papers
and
put
them
back
in
the
box
with
the
photographs
and
the
wedding
ring
for
the
moment
she
wondered
what
her
real
name
might
be
for
iris
temple
was
only
a
stage
name
then
she
dismissed
the
matter
as
of
no
importance
for
she
certainly
would
not
care
to
bear
the
name
of
the
man
who
had
deserted
her
mother
in
her
hour
of
need
she
wondered
why
aunt
peace
had
never
given
her
the
papers
before
but
after
all
what
good
could
it
have
done
what
had
she
gained
by
it
even
now
in
a
flash
of
insight
she
saw
that
she
had
been
given
a
feeling
of
definite
relationship
with
the
woman
in
the
tawdry
stage
trappings
who
had
loved
much
and
suffered
more
that
though
an
old
grave
divided
them
she
was
not
quite
motherless
not
quite
alone
for
the
first
time
since
aunt
peace
was
stricken
with
the
fever
balm
came
into
the
girl
sore
heart
below
lynn
played
unceasingly
four
hours
a
day
thought
iris
one
sixth
of
life
and
for
what
lynn
was
asking
himself
the
same
question
for
what
ambition
was
strong
within
him
but
herr
kaufmann
words
had
struck
deep
i
will
be
an
artist
he
said
to
himself
passionately
i
will
he
worked
feverishly
at
his
concerto
but
his
mind
was
not
upon
it
he
was
thinking
of
iris
and
of
the
unconscious
scorn
in
her
face
when
she
discovered
that
he
had
written
the
letters
he
put
down
his
violin
and
meditated
as
many
a
man
in
that
very
room
had
done
before
him
upon
the
problem
of
the
eternal
feminine
iris
was
incomprehensible
he
knew
that
the
letters
had
not
displeased
her
that
on
the
contrary
she
had
been
unusually
happy
when
they
came
he
remembered
also
that
moonlight
night
when
safely
screened
by
the
shrubbery
across
the
street
he
had
seen
her
put
the
flower
upon
the
and
as
swiftly
take
it
away
he
had
loved
her
all
the
more
for
that
quick
impulse
that
retreat
and
put
the
memory
securely
away
in
his
heart
biding
his
time
iris
he
asked
at
luncheon
will
you
go
for
a
walk
with
me
this
afternoon
no
she
returned
shortly
why
not
it
is
too
wet
is
it
i
going
by
myself
i
prefer
to
be
alone
lynn
coloured
and
said
nothing
more
in
the
afternoon
while
he
was
at
work
he
saw
her
trip
daintily
down
the
path
lifting
her
skirts
to
avoid
the
pools
of
water
the
summer
shower
had
left
he
watched
her
until
she
was
no
longer
within
range
of
his
vision
then
went
back
to
his
violin
iris
had
no
definite
errand
except
to
the
where
as
usual
there
was
nothing
but
it
rested
her
to
be
outdoors
it
is
unfailing
charm
that
she
responds
readily
to
every
mood
and
ultimately
brings
extremes
to
a
common
level
of
quiet
cheerfulness
she
leaned
over
the
bridge
and
looked
into
the
stream
where
her
own
face
was
mirrored
she
saw
herself
sad
and
old
a
woman
of
mature
years
still
further
aged
by
trouble
what
had
become
of
the
happy
girl
of
a
few
months
ago
the
thought
of
lynn
recurred
persistently
and
always
with
repulsion
what
should
she
do
she
could
not
wholly
ignore
him
year
in
and
year
out
and
live
in
the
same
house
it
must
be
nearly
time
for
him
to
go
away
and
leave
her
in
peace
then
iris
gasped
for
it
was
lynn
house
his
and
his
mother
she
was
there
upon
sufferance
only
a
guest
no
not
a
guest
an
intruder
an
interloper
in
her
new
trouble
she
thought
of
herr
kaufmann
always
gentle
always
wise
with
iris
action
followed
swiftly
upon
impulse
and
she
went
rapidly
up
the
hill
fräulein
fredrika
was
out
but
the
master
was
in
the
shop
so
she
went
in
at
the
lower
door
so
he
said
kindly
one
little
lady
comes
to
see
the
old
man
it
is
long
since
you
have
come
i
have
been
in
trouble
faltered
iris
yes
returned
the
master
i
have
heard
mine
heart
has
been
very
sorry
for
you
it
was
lovely
of
you
she
went
on
choking
back
a
sob
to
come
and
play
for
us
we
appreciated
it
irving
and
i
doctor
brinkerhoff
and
lynn
she
added
grudgingly
the
herr
irving
said
the
master
with
interest
he
has
appreciated
mine
playing
of
course
we
all
did
mine
pupil
progresses
he
remarked
enigmatically
was
it
began
iris
hesitating
over
the
words
was
it
the
cremona
the
master
looked
at
her
sharply
yes
why
not
one
gives
one
best
to
death
death
demands
it
and
takes
it
said
the
girl
that
is
why
she
spoke
bitterly
and
herr
kaufmann
put
down
the
violin
he
was
working
upon
his
heart
went
out
to
iris
and
ghostly
her
eyes
burning
fiercely
he
saw
that
her
hands
were
trembling
and
moving
his
chair
closer
he
took
them
both
in
his
little
lady
he
said
it
makes
mine
old
heart
ache
to
see
you
so
close
with
sorrow
if
it
could
be
divided
i
would
take
mine
share
because
these
broad
shoulders
are
used
to
one
heavy
burden
and
a
little
more
would
not
matter
so
much
but
one
must
learn
even
though
the
cross
is
very
hard
to
bear
it
is
most
difficult
and
yet
some
day
you
will
see
you
have
only
to
look
out
of
your
window
for
one
year
to
understand
it
all
first
it
is
winter
and
the
snow
is
deep
upon
the
ground
all
the
flowers
are
dead
and
there
are
no
birds
the
moon
shines
cold
and
there
are
many
storms
but
so
slow
that
you
can
never
see
it
there
is
change
presently
the
bare
branches
turn
in
their
sleep
and
wake
up
with
leaves
the
birds
come
back
and
all
the
earth
is
glad
again
then
everything
grows
and
it
is
all
in
one
blossom
on
the
wide
fields
there
is
much
grain
and
all
hearts
are
singing
even
after
the
frost
everything
is
glad
for
a
little
while
and
then
very
slowly
it
is
winter
once
more
little
lady
do
you
not
see
there
must
always
be
winter
there
must
always
be
night
and
storm
and
cold
it
is
then
that
the
flowers
rest
they
can
not
always
be
in
bloom
but
somewhere
on
the
great
world
the
sun
is
always
shining
and
just
so
sure
as
you
live
it
will
sometime
shine
on
you
the
dear
god
has
made
it
so
there
is
so
much
sun
and
so
much
storm
and
we
must
have
our
share
of
both
it
is
winter
in
your
heart
now
but
soon
it
will
be
spring
you
have
had
one
long
summer
and
there
must
be
something
in
between
we
are
not
different
from
all
else
the
dear
god
has
made
it
is
all
in
one
law
as
the
herr
doctor
will
tell
you
he
is
most
wise
and
he
has
helped
me
to
understand
but
aunt
peace
sobbed
the
girl
aunt
peace
is
dead
and
mother
too
i
am
all
alone
little
lady
said
the
master
very
tenderly
you
must
never
say
you
are
alone
because
you
have
had
much
love
shall
you
be
a
child
when
it
is
taken
away
has
it
meant
so
little
to
you
that
it
leaves
nothing
just
so
strong
and
beautiful
as
it
has
been
just
so
much
strength
and
beauty
does
it
leave
there
are
many
in
this
world
who
would
be
so
glad
to
change
places
with
you
to
be
dead
he
went
on
bitterly
that
is
nothing
beside
one
living
grave
it
is
by
far
the
easier
loss
he
left
her
and
went
to
the
window
where
he
stood
for
a
long
time
with
his
back
toward
her
then
iris
perceived
her
own
selfishness
and
she
crept
up
beside
him
slipping
her
cold
little
hand
into
his
i
understand
she
said
gently
you
have
had
sorrow
too
the
master
smiled
but
she
saw
that
his
eyes
were
wet
yes
he
sighed
i
know
mine
sorrow
we
are
old
friends
then
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
ever
so
softly
upon
her
forehead
it
was
like
a
benediction
i
think
she
said
after
a
little
that
i
must
go
away
from
east
lancaster
so
and
why
iris
knit
her
brows
thoughtfully
well
she
explained
i
have
no
right
here
the
house
is
irving
and
after
her
it
belongs
to
lynn
aunt
peace
said
it
was
to
be
my
home
while
i
lived
but
that
was
only
because
she
did
not
want
to
turn
me
out
she
was
too
kind
to
do
that
but
i
do
not
belong
there
the
herr
irving
said
the
master
in
astonishment
does
he
want
you
to
go
away
no
no
cried
iris
do
misunderstand
they
have
said
nothing
they
have
been
lovely
to
me
but
i
ca
help
feeling
the
master
nodded
yes
i
see
perhaps
you
will
come
to
live
with
mine
sister
and
me
the
old
house
needs
young
faces
and
the
sound
of
young
feet
mine
house
he
said
with
quiet
dignity
is
very
large
even
in
her
perplexity
iris
wondered
why
the
little
on
the
brink
of
the
cliff
always
seemed
a
mansion
to
its
owner
quickly
he
read
her
thought
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
he
continued
you
are
thinking
that
mine
house
is
small
three
rooms
upstairs
and
three
rooms
downstairs
fredrika
could
sleep
in
mine
room
and
i
could
take
the
store
closet
back
of
mine
shop
and
keep
the
wood
for
the
violins
at
the
herr
doctor
upstairs
you
could
have
one
bedroom
and
one
parlour
fredrika
and
i
would
come
up
only
to
eat
herr
kaufmann
cried
iris
her
heart
warming
to
him
it
is
lovely
of
you
but
i
ca
do
you
see
if
i
could
stay
anywhere
i
could
stay
where
i
am
it
was
not
a
clear
sentence
but
he
grasped
its
meaning
yes
i
see
but
when
i
say
mine
house
is
large
it
is
not
of
these
six
rooms
that
i
think
have
you
not
read
in
the
good
book
that
in
mine
father
house
there
are
many
mansions
so
well
it
is
in
those
mansions
that
i
live
i
have
put
aside
mine
sorrow
and
i
wait
till
the
dear
god
is
pleased
to
take
me
home
to
take
us
home
said
iris
thoughtfully
perhaps
aunt
peace
was
tired
yes
answered
the
master
she
was
tired
otherwise
she
would
have
been
allowed
to
stay
you
have
not
been
thinking
of
her
but
of
yourself
perhaps
i
have
she
admitted
if
you
go
away
he
went
on
it
is
better
that
you
should
study
you
have
one
fine
voice
and
with
sorrow
in
your
heart
you
can
make
much
from
it
those
who
have
been
made
great
have
first
suffered
iris
turned
upon
him
you
mean
that
she
asked
sharply
of
course
he
returned
serenely
before
you
can
help
those
who
have
suffered
you
must
suffer
yourself
it
is
so
written
iris
sighed
heavily
i
must
go
she
said
dully
not
yet
wait
he
went
to
his
bedroom
and
came
back
with
a
violin
case
he
opened
it
carefully
unwrapped
the
many
thicknesses
of
silk
and
took
out
the
cremona
see
he
said
with
his
face
aglow
is
it
not
most
beautiful
when
you
are
sad
you
can
remember
that
you
have
seen
mine
cremona
thank
you
returned
iris
her
voice
strangely
mingled
with
both
laughter
and
tears
i
will
remember
when
she
went
home
the
master
looked
after
her
for
a
moment
or
two
then
turned
away
from
the
window
to
wipe
his
eyes
he
was
drawn
by
temperament
to
all
who
sorrowed
and
he
had
loved
iris
for
years
that
night
she
sat
alone
in
the
library
sheltered
by
the
darkness
margaret
was
reading
in
her
own
room
and
lynn
was
out
more
clearly
than
ever
iris
saw
that
she
must
go
away
she
had
no
definite
plan
but
herr
kaufmann
suggestion
seemed
a
good
one
when
lynn
came
in
he
lit
the
candles
in
the
parlour
iris
hoped
he
would
go
upstairs
without
coming
into
the
library
but
he
did
not
she
shrank
back
into
her
chair
trusting
that
he
would
not
see
her
but
with
unerring
instinct
he
went
straight
to
her
sweetheart
he
whispered
are
you
here
i
here
said
iris
frostily
but
that
is
my
name
the
timid
little
voice
thrilled
him
with
a
great
tenderness
and
he
quickly
possessed
himself
of
her
hand
iris
darling
he
went
on
why
do
you
avoid
me
i
have
been
miserable
ever
since
i
told
you
i
wrote
the
letters
it
was
wrong
to
write
them
she
said
why
dear
because
did
you
like
them
no
i
did
think
you
were
displeased
he
was
too
chivalrous
to
remind
her
of
that
moonlight
night
it
was
very
wrong
she
repeated
stubbornly
then
forgive
me
it
nothing
to
me
she
returned
unmoved
i
hoped
it
would
be
said
lynn
gently
every
time
i
walked
over
to
the
next
town
to
mail
them
i
knew
you
had
seen
any
of
my
writing
and
i
was
sure
you
would
suspect
me
nice
advantage
to
take
of
a
girl
was
it
demanded
iris
her
temper
rising
she
rose
and
started
toward
the
door
but
lynn
kept
her
back
the
starlight
showed
him
her
face
white
and
troubled
sweetheart
he
said
listen
just
a
moment
dear
that
is
much
to
ask
is
it
if
it
was
wrong
to
write
the
letters
then
i
ask
you
to
forgive
me
but
every
word
was
true
i
love
you
iris
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
with
all
your
heart
she
repeated
scornfully
you
have
no
heart
iris
he
said
unsteadily
what
do
you
mean
this
she
cried
in
a
passion
you
have
no
more
feeling
than
the
ground
beneath
your
feet
have
i
seen
have
i
known
aunt
peace
died
and
you
did
not
care
you
only
thought
it
was
unpleasant
you
play
like
a
machine
a
mountebank
tricks
with
the
violin
tricks
with
words
and
yet
you
dare
to
say
you
love
me
iris
darling
cried
lynn
stung
to
the
quick
do
once
for
all
i
will
have
my
say
i
go
out
of
your
house
forever
i
have
no
right
here
no
place
i
am
an
intruder
and
i
am
going
away
you
will
never
see
me
again
never
as
long
as
you
live
you
a
machine
a
clod
a
trickster
a
thing
without
a
heart
you
shall
not
insult
me
again
white
to
the
lips
trembling
like
a
leaf
iris
shook
herself
free
and
ran
up
to
her
room
lynn
drew
a
long
shuddering
breath
god
he
whispered
clenching
his
hands
tightly
god
xvi
afraid
of
life
she
kept
her
word
to
irving
she
merely
said
that
she
had
already
trespassed
too
long
upon
their
hospitality
and
that
she
thought
it
best
to
go
away
she
had
talked
with
herr
kaufmann
and
he
had
advised
her
to
go
to
the
city
and
have
her
voice
trained
yes
she
would
write
and
would
always
think
of
them
kindly
lynn
who
had
passed
the
first
sleepless
night
of
his
life
went
to
the
train
with
her
but
few
words
were
spoken
iris
was
cool
dignified
and
cruelly
formal
an
immeasurable
distance
lay
between
them
and
one
at
least
made
no
effort
to
lessen
it
they
had
only
a
few
minutes
to
wait
and
just
as
the
train
came
in
sight
lynn
bent
over
her
iris
he
said
unsteadily
if
you
ever
want
me
will
you
promise
me
that
you
will
let
me
know
yes
she
replied
with
an
incredulous
laugh
if
i
ever
want
you
i
will
let
you
know
i
will
go
to
you
said
lynn
struggling
for
his
from
the
very
end
of
the
world
just
send
me
the
one
word
and
let
me
thank
you
now
for
all
the
happiness
you
have
given
me
and
for
the
memory
of
you
which
i
shall
have
in
my
heart
for
always
you
are
quite
welcome
she
returned
frigidly
you
but
the
roar
of
the
train
mercifully
drowned
her
words
the
sun
still
shone
the
birds
did
not
cease
their
singing
outwardly
the
world
was
just
as
fair
even
though
iris
had
gone
lynn
walked
away
blindly
no
longer
dull
but
keenly
alive
to
his
hurt
from
the
crucible
of
eternity
time
the
magician
draws
the
days
some
are
wholly
made
of
beauty
of
wide
sunlit
reaches
and
cool
silences
some
of
dreams
and
twilight
with
roses
breathing
fragrance
through
the
dusk
some
of
darkness
wild
and
terrible
lighted
only
by
a
single
star
others
still
of
riving
lightnings
and
vast
reverberating
thunders
while
the
heart
swelled
to
bursting
breaks
on
the
reef
of
pain
it
seemed
as
though
lynn
heart
were
rising
in
an
effort
to
escape
i
must
keep
it
down
he
thought
it
was
like
an
imprisoned
bird
cut
bruised
and
bleeding
beating
against
the
walls
of
flesh
and
yet
there
was
a
hand
upon
it
and
the
iron
fingers
clutched
unmercifully
iris
had
gone
and
the
dream
was
at
an
end
iris
had
gone
flouting
him
to
the
last
calling
his
love
an
insult
machine
clod
mountebank
the
bitter
words
rang
through
his
consciousness
again
and
again
it
might
be
true
part
of
it
at
least
herr
kaufmann
had
told
him
more
than
once
that
he
played
like
a
machine
clod
possibly
mountebank
that
might
be
too
trickster
with
the
violin
trickster
with
words
perhaps
but
a
thing
without
a
heart
lynn
laughed
bitterly
and
put
his
hand
against
his
breast
to
quiet
the
throbbing
no
one
knew
no
one
must
ever
know
iris
would
not
betray
him
he
was
sure
of
that
but
he
must
be
on
his
guard
lest
he
should
betray
himself
he
must
hide
it
must
keep
on
living
and
appear
to
be
the
same
his
mother
keen
eyes
must
see
nothing
amiss
fortunately
he
could
be
alone
a
great
deal
outdoors
or
practising
and
at
night
he
shuddered
at
the
white
night
through
which
he
had
somehow
lived
and
wondered
how
many
more
would
follow
in
its
train
suddenly
he
remembered
that
it
was
his
lesson
day
and
he
was
not
prepared
common
courtesy
demanded
that
he
should
go
up
to
herr
kaufmann
and
tell
him
that
he
did
not
feel
like
taking
his
lesson
that
he
had
a
headache
or
something
of
the
kind
that
he
had
hurt
his
wrist
perhaps
he
hoped
that
fräulein
fredrika
would
come
to
the
door
and
that
he
might
leave
his
message
with
her
but
it
was
herr
kaufmann
who
answered
his
ring
so
said
the
master
you
are
once
more
late
no
answered
lynn
refusing
to
meet
his
eyes
i
just
came
to
tell
you
that
i
could
take
my
lesson
i
do
think
he
stammered
that
i
can
ever
take
any
more
lessons
and
why
demanded
the
master
come
in
before
he
realised
it
he
was
in
the
parlour
gay
with
its
accustomed
bright
colours
one
look
at
lynn
face
had
assured
herr
kaufmann
that
something
was
wrong
and
for
the
first
time
he
was
drawn
to
his
pupil
so
said
the
master
mine
son
is
it
not
well
with
you
lynn
turned
away
to
hide
the
working
of
his
face
not
very
he
answered
in
a
low
tone
miss
iris
said
the
master
she
will
have
gone
away
it
was
like
the
tearing
of
a
wound
yes
replied
lynn
almost
in
a
whisper
she
went
this
morning
and
you
are
sad
because
she
has
gone
away
i
am
sorry
mineself
miss
iris
is
one
little
lady
yes
returned
lynn
clenching
his
hands
she
is
something
in
the
boy
eyes
stirred
an
old
memory
and
made
the
heart
very
tender
toward
him
mine
son
he
said
very
gently
if
something
has
troubled
you
perhaps
it
will
give
you
one
relief
to
tell
me
only
yesterday
miss
iris
was
here
she
was
very
sad
when
she
came
and
when
she
went
away
the
world
was
more
sunny
or
so
i
think
quickly
surmising
that
herr
kaufmann
had
something
more
than
a
hint
of
it
and
more
eager
for
sympathy
than
he
realised
lynn
stammered
out
the
story
choking
at
the
end
of
it
there
was
a
long
silence
in
which
the
master
went
back
years
lynn
eyes
so
full
of
trouble
were
they
not
like
another
long
ago
the
of
the
thunder
once
more
reverberated
through
the
forest
where
the
great
boughs
arched
like
the
nave
of
a
cathedral
and
the
dead
leaves
scurried
in
fright
before
the
rising
wind
that
is
all
said
the
boy
his
face
white
to
the
lips
it
is
not
much
but
it
is
a
great
deal
to
me
so
said
the
master
scornfully
you
are
to
be
an
artist
and
you
are
afraid
of
life
you
are
summoned
to
the
ranks
of
the
great
and
you
shrink
from
the
signal
cover
your
ears
that
you
shall
not
hear
the
trumpet
call
this
when
you
should
be
on
your
knees
thanking
the
good
god
that
at
last
he
has
taught
you
pain
lynn
face
was
pitiful
and
yet
he
listened
eagerly
there
is
no
point
the
master
was
saying
if
you
take
it
you
must
pay
nothing
in
this
world
is
free
but
the
sun
and
the
fresh
air
you
must
buy
shelter
food
clothing
with
the
work
of
your
hands
and
brain
if
someone
else
gives
it
to
you
it
is
not
yours
you
are
one
parasite
you
must
earn
it
all
you
think
you
can
take
all
and
give
nothing
it
is
not
so
for
six
eight
years
now
you
study
the
violin
you
learn
the
scales
the
technique
the
good
wrist
and
nothing
else
i
teach
you
all
i
can
but
it
must
come
from
yourself
not
me
i
can
only
guide
tell
you
when
you
have
made
one
mistake
what
is
it
that
the
art
is
for
is
it
for
one
great
assembly
of
people
to
pay
the
high
price
for
admission
they
say
young
man
what
good
tone
he
has
what
bowing
what
fine
wrist
how
smooth
he
plays
his
concerto
when
it
is
marked
fortissimo
see
how
he
plays
fortissimo
it
is
most
skilful
is
the
art
for
that
no
it
is
for
everyone
in
the
world
who
has
known
trouble
to
be
lifted
up
and
made
strong
they
care
nothing
for
the
means
only
for
the
end
they
have
no
eyes
for
the
fine
bowing
the
good
wrist
what
shall
they
know
of
technique
and
yet
you
must
have
the
technique
else
you
can
not
give
the
message
everyone
that
hears
has
had
his
own
sorrow
none
of
them
are
new
ones
they
are
all
old
and
so
few
that
one
person
can
suffer
all
it
is
for
you
to
take
that
to
know
the
hurt
heart
and
the
rebellious
soul
so
that
you
can
comfort
lift
up
and
make
noble
with
your
art
and
you
you
cry
out
when
you
should
be
glad
miss
iris
does
not
love
you
and
beyond
that
you
do
not
see
suppose
one
thousand
people
were
before
you
and
all
had
loved
someone
who
did
not
care
for
them
could
you
make
it
easier
if
you
knew
nothing
of
it
by
yourself
listen
on
a
hill
in
italy
there
was
once
a
tree
it
was
a
seed
at
the
beginning
a
seed
you
could
hold
with
the
ends
of
your
fingers
so
it
was
buried
in
the
ground
covered
up
with
earth
like
something
that
had
died
do
you
think
the
seed
liked
that
but
is
it
afraid
when
its
heart
is
swelling
no
it
breaks
through
with
the
great
hurt
still
there
is
earth
around
it
still
it
is
buried
but
yet
it
aspires
one
day
it
comes
to
the
surface
of
the
ground
and
once
more
it
breaks
through
with
pain
but
the
sun
is
bright
and
warm
and
the
seed
grows
careless
feet
trample
upon
it
there
is
yet
one
more
hurt
but
it
straightens
waits
through
the
long
nights
for
the
blessed
sun
and
so
on
until
it
is
so
high
as
one
bush
constantly
there
is
growing
one
aspiration
upward
bark
comes
and
the
tree
swells
outward
always
with
pain
someone
cuts
off
all
the
lower
branches
and
the
tree
bleeds
yet
keeps
on
other
branches
come
thick
about
it
there
is
one
struggle
but
through
the
dense
growth
the
tree
climbs
always
upward
in
the
sun
above
the
thick
shade
it
can
laugh
at
the
ache
and
the
thorns
but
it
does
not
forget
and
so
upward
always
upward
till
it
is
lifted
high
above
its
fellows
birds
come
there
to
sing
to
build
their
nests
to
rear
their
young
to
mourn
when
one
little
bird
falls
out
from
the
nest
and
is
made
dead
the
sun
shines
fiercely
and
it
nearly
dies
in
the
heat
the
storm
comes
and
it
is
shrouded
in
ice
made
almost
to
die
with
the
cold
the
wild
winds
rock
it
and
tear
off
the
branches
making
it
bleed
there
must
always
be
pain
the
thunders
play
over
its
head
the
lightnings
burn
it
and
yet
its
heart
lives
on
the
rains
beat
upon
it
like
one
river
and
still
it
grows
the
years
go
by
and
each
one
brings
new
hurt
but
the
tree
is
made
hard
and
strong
one
day
there
comes
a
man
to
look
at
it
all
the
straight
fine
length
the
smooth
trunk
will
do
he
says
and
with
his
axe
he
chops
it
down
do
you
think
it
does
not
hurt
the
tree
after
the
long
years
of
fighting
to
be
cut
like
that
then
it
falls
crashing
heavy
through
the
branches
to
the
ground
see
there
must
always
be
pain
even
at
the
end
then
more
cutting
more
bleeding
more
heat
more
cold
fine
tools
steel
knives
that
tear
and
split
the
fibres
apart
do
you
think
it
does
not
hurt
more
sun
more
cold
still
more
cutting
tearing
and
throwing
aside
then
one
day
it
is
finished
and
there
is
mine
cremona
all
the
strength
all
the
beauty
all
the
pain
made
into
mine
violin
but
the
end
is
not
yet
god
is
working
with
me
and
mine
as
well
as
with
mine
instrument
as
yet
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
for
me
it
comes
to
me
through
pain
one
old
gentleman
one
of
the
first
to
travel
abroad
from
this
country
for
pleasure
he
goes
to
italy
he
finds
it
in
the
hands
of
one
ignorant
drunkard
and
he
buys
it
for
little
he
brings
it
home
but
he
can
not
play
and
no
one
else
can
play
he
does
not
know
its
value
but
it
pleases
him
and
he
takes
it
for
long
years
it
stays
in
one
attic
with
the
dust
and
the
cobwebs
kicked
aside
by
careless
feet
meanwhile
i
know
one
lovely
young
lady
i
meet
her
by
chance
and
we
like
each
other
oh
so
much
she
says
to
me
live
on
one
hill
in
west
lancaster
and
mine
mother
she
would
never
let
me
speak
with
you
so
i
must
see
you
sometimes
quite
by
accident
elsewhere
on
pleasant
days
i
often
go
to
walk
in
the
woods
mine
mother
likes
me
to
be
outdoors
so
many
times
we
meet
and
we
talk
of
strange
things
each
day
we
love
each
other
more
and
all
the
time
her
mother
does
not
suspect
we
plan
to
go
away
together
and
never
let
anyone
know
until
we
are
married
and
it
is
too
late
but
first
i
must
find
work
she
says
to
me
one
day
in
mine
attic
there
is
one
old
violin
which
i
think
must
be
valuable
mine
mother
is
away
with
a
friend
and
the
house
is
by
itself
will
you
not
come
up
to
see
so
we
go
and
the
house
is
very
quiet
no
one
is
there
we
go
like
two
thieves
to
the
attic
laughing
as
though
we
were
children
once
more
presently
we
find
the
violin
and
i
see
that
it
is
one
cremona
very
old
very
fine
but
with
no
strings
i
fit
on
some
strings
that
i
have
in
mine
pocket
but
there
is
no
bow
and
i
can
only
play
pizzicato
i
need
to
hear
the
tone
but
one
moment
to
know
what
it
is
that
i
have
is
most
wonderful
i
say
and
then
the
door
opens
and
one
very
angry
lady
stands
there
she
tells
me
that
i
shall
never
come
into
that
house
again
that
i
must
go
right
away
that
i
have
no
what
do
you
say
no
social
place
and
that
i
am
not
to
speak
with
her
daughter
to
her
she
says
will
attend
to
you
very
soon
we
creep
down
the
stairs
together
and
mine
beloved
whispers
day
at
four
at
the
old
place
until
i
come
i
understand
and
i
go
away
but
mine
heart
is
very
troubled
for
her
for
long
days
i
wait
and
every
day
at
four
i
am
at
the
in
the
wood
but
no
one
comes
and
there
is
no
message
no
word
all
the
time
i
feel
as
you
feel
now
because
miss
iris
has
gone
away
and
does
not
care
i
wait
and
wait
but
i
can
get
no
news
and
i
fear
to
go
to
the
house
because
i
shall
perhaps
harm
mine
beloved
and
she
has
told
me
what
to
do
every
day
i
am
there
even
in
the
rain
waiting
at
last
she
comes
with
the
violin
under
her
arm
wrapped
in
her
coat
have
only
one
minute
she
cries
are
going
to
take
me
away
and
we
can
never
see
each
other
again
so
i
give
you
this
you
must
keep
it
and
when
you
are
sad
it
will
tell
you
how
much
i
love
you
how
much
i
shall
always
love
you
you
will
not
forget
me
she
says
there
is
just
one
instant
more
together
with
the
thunders
and
the
lightnings
all
around
us
then
i
am
alone
except
for
mine
violin
do
you
not
see
there
must
always
be
pain
the
dear
god
has
made
mine
instrument
and
in
the
same
way
he
has
made
me
with
the
cutting
and
the
bruises
and
the
long
night
i
too
have
known
the
storm
and
all
the
fury
of
the
winds
and
rain
like
the
tree
i
have
aspired
i
have
grown
upward
i
have
done
the
best
i
could
otherwise
i
should
not
be
fitted
to
play
on
mine
cremona
i
would
not
deserve
to
touch
it
and
so
in
a
way
i
am
glad
i
have
had
mine
fame
he
went
on
with
the
sorrow
in
mine
heart
i
have
studied
and
worked
until
i
have
made
mineself
one
great
artist
if
you
do
not
believe
i
can
show
you
the
papers
where
much
has
been
written
of
me
and
mine
violin
women
have
cried
when
i
have
played
and
have
thrown
their
red
roses
to
me
i
had
the
technique
and
when
the
hurt
broke
open
mine
heart
i
was
immediately
one
artist
i
understood
i
could
play
i
could
lift
up
all
who
suffered
because
i
had
known
suffering
mineself
mine
son
do
you
not
understand
you
can
give
only
what
you
have
if
one
sorrow
is
in
your
heart
if
you
have
learned
the
beauty
and
the
nobility
of
it
you
can
teach
others
the
same
thing
you
can
show
them
how
to
rise
above
it
like
the
tree
that
had
one
long
lifetime
of
hurt
and
ended
in
mine
cremona
to
help
all
who
hear
the
one
who
plays
the
instrument
must
be
made
in
the
same
way
of
the
same
influences
the
cutting
the
night
and
the
cold
of
softness
nothing
good
ever
comes
for
one
must
always
fight
nothing
in
this
whole
world
is
free
but
the
sun
and
the
fresh
air
and
the
water
to
drink
we
must
pay
the
fair
price
for
all
else
i
have
had
mine
fame
and
i
have
paid
mine
price
but
the
heights
are
lonely
and
sometimes
i
think
it
would
be
better
to
walk
in
the
valley
with
a
woman
hand
in
mine
but
at
the
first
before
i
knew
i
chose
i
said
will
be
an
artist
and
so
i
am
but
i
have
paid
oh
mine
son
i
have
paid
and
i
am
still
paying
there
is
no
end
the
master
face
was
grey
and
haggard
but
his
eyes
burned
lynn
saw
what
it
had
cost
him
to
open
this
secret
chamber
to
lay
bare
this
old
wound
and
i
he
said
huskily
i
touched
the
cremona
yes
said
the
master
sadly
on
that
first
day
you
lifted
up
mine
cremona
and
until
i
have
never
forgiven
there
has
been
resentment
in
mine
old
heart
for
you
though
i
have
tried
to
put
it
aside
her
hands
were
last
upon
it
hers
and
mine
when
i
touched
it
it
was
the
place
where
her
white
fingers
rested
where
many
a
time
i
put
mine
kiss
to
ease
mine
heart
and
you
you
took
that
away
from
me
if
i
had
only
known
murmured
lynn
but
you
did
not
know
said
the
master
kindly
and
i
have
forgiven
thank
you
returned
lynn
with
a
lump
in
his
throat
it
is
much
to
give
sometimes
sighed
the
master
when
i
have
been
discouraged
i
have
been
very
hungry
for
someone
to
understand
me
someone
to
laugh
to
touch
mine
tired
eyes
to
make
me
forget
with
her
little
sweet
ways
in
mine
fancy
i
have
seen
it
all
and
more
when
i
have
gone
down
the
hill
to
the
where
there
has
never
been
the
letter
from
her
and
the
little
children
have
run
to
me
holding
out
their
arms
that
i
should
take
them
up
i
have
felt
that
the
price
was
too
high
that
i
have
paid
but
all
the
time
i
have
understood
that
on
the
heights
one
must
go
alone
for
a
time
at
least
with
the
thunders
and
the
lightnings
and
the
storms
if
i
had
been
given
one
son
i
think
he
would
have
been
like
you
one
fine
tall
young
fellow
with
the
honest
face
and
the
laughing
ways
but
you
have
been
shielded
and
i
should
not
have
done
so
i
should
have
let
you
grow
from
the
start
and
learn
all
things
so
soon
as
you
could
i
never
knew
my
father
lynn
said
deeply
moved
but
if
i
could
choose
i
would
choose
you
so
said
the
master
his
eyes
filling
then
their
hands
met
in
a
long
clasp
of
understanding
already
i
am
the
richer
for
it
lynn
went
on
after
a
little
i
know
now
what
i
did
not
know
before
the
boy
face
was
still
white
but
the
look
of
hopeless
despair
was
merged
into
something
which
foreshadowed
ultimate
acceptance
the
master
still
held
his
hand
if
you
are
to
be
an
artist
he
said
once
more
you
must
not
be
afraid
of
life
you
must
welcome
it
to
its
utmost
cross
you
must
take
the
cold
the
heat
the
poverty
the
hunger
the
burning
way
through
the
desert
the
steeps
the
keen
hurt
and
the
happiness
it
is
all
one
for
it
gives
you
knowledge
you
must
know
all
the
pain
of
the
world
face
to
face
if
you
are
to
help
those
who
bear
it
keen
feelings
give
you
the
great
hurt
but
also
in
payment
the
great
joy
the
balance
swings
true
the
herr
doctor
has
told
me
this
he
is
most
wise
he
understands
i
see
answered
lynn
i
will
never
be
afraid
again
that
said
the
master
with
his
face
alight
that
is
mine
son
true
courage
take
it
with
your
head
up
your
teeth
shut
and
your
heart
always
believing
fear
nothing
and
much
will
be
given
back
to
you
is
it
not
so
let
life
do
all
it
can
you
will
never
be
crushed
unless
you
are
willing
that
it
should
be
so
defeat
comes
only
to
those
who
invite
it
i
see
said
lynn
again
with
all
my
heart
i
thank
you
he
went
away
soon
afterward
insensibly
comforted
overnight
he
had
come
into
his
heritage
of
pain
had
lost
the
girl
he
loved
and
in
swift
restitution
found
comradeship
with
the
master
that
stately
figure
lingered
long
before
his
vision
grey
and
rugged
yet
with
a
certain
graciousness
simple
kindly
and
yet
austere
one
who
had
accepted
his
sorrow
and
by
some
alchemy
of
the
spirit
transmuted
it
into
universal
compassion
to
speak
through
the
cremona
to
all
who
could
understand
xvii
he
loves
her
still
when
doctor
brinkerhoff
came
on
wednesday
evening
he
was
surprised
to
discover
that
iris
had
gone
away
it
was
sudden
was
it
not
he
asked
it
seemed
so
to
us
returned
margaret
we
knew
nothing
of
it
until
the
morning
she
started
she
had
probably
been
planning
it
for
a
long
time
though
she
did
not
take
us
into
her
confidence
until
the
last
minute
lynn
sat
with
his
face
turned
away
from
his
mother
did
you
perhaps
suspect
that
she
was
going
the
doctor
directly
inquired
of
lynn
he
hesitated
for
the
barest
perceptible
interval
before
he
spoke
she
told
us
at
the
breakfast
table
he
answered
iris
is
replete
with
surprises
but
before
that
continued
the
doctor
did
you
have
no
suspicion
lynn
laughed
shortly
how
should
i
suspect
he
parried
i
know
nothing
of
the
ways
of
women
women
observed
the
doctor
with
an
air
of
knowledge
women
are
inscrutable
for
instance
i
can
not
understand
why
miss
iris
did
not
come
to
say
to
me
i
am
her
and
it
would
have
been
natural
are
painful
said
margaret
we
germans
do
not
say
but
only
wiedersehen
perhaps
we
shall
see
her
again
perhaps
not
no
one
knows
fräulein
fredrika
does
not
say
wiedersehen
put
in
lynn
anxious
to
turn
the
trend
of
the
conversation
no
responded
the
doctor
with
a
smile
she
says
will
come
once
again
yes
it
would
be
most
kind
he
imitated
the
tone
and
manner
so
exactly
that
lynn
laughed
but
it
was
a
hollow
laugh
without
mirth
in
it
do
not
misunderstand
me
said
the
doctor
quickly
it
was
not
my
intention
to
ridicule
the
fräulein
she
is
a
most
estimable
woman
do
you
perhaps
know
her
he
asked
of
margaret
i
have
not
that
pleasure
she
replied
she
was
not
here
when
i
first
came
the
doctor
went
on
but
herr
kaufmann
sent
for
her
soon
afterward
they
are
devoted
to
each
other
and
yet
so
unlike
you
would
have
laughed
to
see
franz
at
work
at
his
housekeeping
before
she
came
a
shadow
crossed
margaret
face
i
have
often
wondered
she
said
clearing
her
throat
why
men
are
not
taught
domestic
tasks
as
well
as
women
it
presupposes
that
they
are
never
to
be
without
the
inevitable
woman
yet
many
of
them
often
are
a
woman
is
trained
to
it
in
the
smallest
details
even
though
she
has
reason
to
suppose
that
she
will
always
have
servants
to
do
it
for
her
then
why
not
a
man
a
good
idea
mother
remarked
lynn
i
shall
take
my
first
lesson
in
keeping
house
you
she
said
fondly
you
why
lynn
lacking
the
others
always
have
me
to
do
it
for
you
that
replied
the
doctor
triumphantly
disproves
your
own
theory
if
you
are
in
earnest
begin
on
the
morrow
to
instruct
mr
irving
margaret
flushed
perceiving
her
own
inconsistency
i
could
be
of
assistance
possibly
he
continued
for
in
the
difficult
school
of
experience
i
have
learned
many
things
i
have
often
taken
professional
pride
in
closing
an
aperture
in
my
clothing
with
neat
stitches
and
the
knowledge
thus
gained
has
helped
me
in
my
surgery
all
things
in
this
world
fit
in
together
it
is
fortunate
if
they
do
she
answered
my
own
scheme
of
things
has
been
very
much
disarranged
yet
as
fräulein
fredrika
would
say
dear
god
knows
life
is
like
one
of
those
puzzles
that
come
in
a
box
it
is
full
of
queer
pieces
which
seemingly
bear
no
relation
to
one
another
and
yet
there
is
a
way
of
putting
it
together
into
a
perfect
whole
sometimes
we
make
a
mistake
at
the
beginning
and
discard
pieces
for
which
we
think
there
is
no
possible
use
it
is
only
at
the
end
that
we
see
we
have
made
a
mistake
and
put
aside
something
of
much
importance
but
it
is
always
too
late
to
go
back
the
pieces
are
gone
in
my
own
life
i
lost
but
one
still
it
was
the
keystone
of
the
whole
when
i
came
from
germany
i
should
have
brought
letters
from
those
in
high
places
there
to
those
in
high
places
here
it
could
easily
have
been
done
i
should
have
had
this
behind
me
when
i
came
to
east
lancaster
and
i
should
not
have
made
the
mistake
of
settling
first
on
the
hill
then
the
doctor
ceased
abruptly
and
sighed
this
country
is
supposed
to
be
very
democratic
said
lynn
chiefly
because
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
say
yes
replied
the
doctor
it
is
in
your
laws
that
all
men
are
free
and
equal
but
it
is
not
so
the
older
civilisations
have
found
there
is
class
and
so
you
will
find
it
here
at
first
when
everything
is
chaotic
all
particles
may
seem
alike
but
in
time
there
is
an
inevitable
readjustment
we
are
getting
very
serious
said
margaret
it
is
an
important
subject
responded
the
doctor
with
dignity
i
have
often
discussed
it
with
my
friend
herr
kaufmann
he
is
a
very
fine
friend
to
have
yes
said
lynn
he
is
it
is
only
lately
that
i
have
learned
to
appreciate
him
one
must
grow
to
understand
him
mused
the
doctor
at
first
i
did
not
i
thought
him
rough
queer
and
full
of
sarcasm
but
afterward
i
saw
that
his
harshness
was
only
a
mask
the
bark
if
i
may
say
so
beneath
it
he
has
a
heart
of
gold
people
began
margaret
avoiding
the
topic
always
seek
their
own
level
just
as
water
does
that
is
why
there
is
class
but
for
a
long
time
they
do
not
find
it
objected
the
doctor
miss
iris
for
instance
her
people
were
of
the
common
sort
and
those
with
whom
she
lived
afterward
were
worse
still
she
by
the
unconscious
reverence
in
his
voice
they
knew
whom
he
meant
she
taught
her
all
the
fineness
she
has
and
that
is
much
it
is
an
argument
for
environment
rather
than
heredity
lynn
left
the
room
abruptly
unable
to
bear
the
talk
of
iris
i
wish
said
the
doctor
at
length
i
wish
you
knew
herr
kaufmann
would
you
like
it
if
i
should
bring
him
to
call
no
cried
margaret
it
is
too
soon
she
added
desperately
too
soon
after
the
doctor
nodded
i
understand
he
said
it
was
a
mistake
on
my
part
for
which
you
must
pardon
me
i
only
thought
you
might
be
a
help
to
each
other
franz
too
has
sorrowed
has
he
asked
margaret
her
lips
barely
moving
yes
the
doctor
went
on
half
to
himself
it
was
an
unhappy
love
affair
the
young
lady
mother
parted
them
because
he
lived
in
west
lancaster
though
he
too
might
have
had
letters
from
high
places
in
germany
he
and
i
made
the
same
mistake
her
mother
repeated
margaret
almost
in
a
whisper
yes
the
young
lady
herself
cared
and
he
she
breathed
leaning
eagerly
forward
her
body
tense
does
he
love
her
still
he
loves
her
still
returned
the
doctor
promptly
and
even
more
than
then
ah
h
the
doctor
roused
himself
what
have
i
done
he
cried
in
genuine
distress
i
have
violated
my
friend
confidence
unthinking
my
friend
for
whom
i
would
make
any
sacrifice
i
have
betrayed
him
no
replied
margaret
with
a
great
effort
at
you
have
not
told
me
her
name
it
is
because
i
do
not
know
it
said
the
doctor
ruefully
if
i
had
known
i
should
have
bleated
it
out
fool
that
i
am
please
do
not
be
troubled
you
have
done
no
harm
herr
kaufmann
and
i
are
practically
strangers
that
is
so
replied
the
doctor
evidently
reassured
and
i
did
not
mean
it
it
is
not
the
same
thing
as
if
i
had
done
it
purposely
not
at
all
the
same
thing
at
times
we
put
something
aside
in
memory
to
be
meditated
upon
later
the
mind
registers
the
exact
words
the
train
of
circumstances
that
caused
their
utterance
all
the
swift
interplay
of
opposing
thought
and
for
the
time
being
forgets
hours
afterward
in
solitude
it
is
recalled
studied
from
every
point
of
view
searched
analysed
questioned
until
it
is
made
to
yield
up
its
hidden
meaning
it
was
thus
that
margaret
put
away
those
four
words
he
loves
her
still
they
are
pathetic
these
tiny
of
memory
where
oftentimes
the
jewel
so
jealously
guarded
by
the
clear
light
of
introspection
is
seen
to
be
only
paste
one
seizes
hungrily
at
the
impulse
that
caused
the
hiding
thinking
that
there
must
be
some
certain
worth
behind
the
deception
but
afterward
painfully
sure
one
locks
the
door
of
the
in
and
steals
away
as
from
a
casket
that
enshrines
the
dead
they
talked
of
other
things
and
at
ten
the
doctor
went
home
leaving
a
farewell
message
for
lynn
and
begging
that
his
kind
remembrances
be
sent
to
iris
when
she
should
write
thank
you
said
irving
i
shall
surely
tell
her
and
she
will
be
glad
the
door
closed
and
almost
immediately
lynn
came
in
from
the
library
rubbing
his
eyes
i
think
i
been
asleep
he
said
it
was
rude
dear
returned
margaret
in
gentle
rebuke
it
is
to
leave
a
guest
i
suppose
it
is
but
i
did
not
intend
to
be
gone
so
long
the
house
seemed
singularly
desolate
filled
as
it
was
with
ghostly
shadows
through
the
rooms
moved
the
memory
of
iris
and
of
that
gentle
mistress
who
slept
in
the
churchyard
who
had
permeated
every
nook
and
corner
of
it
with
the
sweetness
of
her
personality
there
was
something
in
the
air
as
though
music
had
just
ceased
the
wraith
of
laughter
the
fall
of
tears
i
miss
iris
said
margaret
dreamily
she
was
like
a
daughter
to
me
taken
off
his
guard
lynn
conscious
face
instantly
betrayed
him
lynn
said
margaret
suddenly
did
you
have
anything
to
do
with
her
going
away
the
answer
was
scarcely
audible
yes
margaret
never
forced
a
confidence
but
after
a
pause
she
said
very
gently
dear
is
there
anything
you
want
to
tell
me
it
nothing
said
lynn
roughly
he
rose
and
walked
around
the
room
nervously
it
nothing
he
repeated
with
assumed
carelessness
i
i
asked
her
to
marry
me
and
she
would
that
all
it
nothing
margaret
first
impulse
was
to
smile
this
child
to
be
talking
of
marriage
then
her
heart
leaped
for
lynn
was
older
than
she
had
been
when
the
star
rose
upon
her
horizon
and
then
set
forever
then
came
a
momentary
awkwardness
childish
though
the
trouble
was
she
pitied
lynn
and
regretted
that
she
could
not
shield
him
from
it
as
she
had
shielded
him
from
all
else
in
his
life
then
resentment
against
iris
what
was
she
a
nameless
outcast
to
scorn
the
offered
distinction
any
woman
in
the
world
might
be
proud
to
become
lynn
wife
then
smiling
at
her
own
folly
margaret
went
to
him
dominated
solely
by
gratitude
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
she
drew
his
tall
head
down
to
kiss
him
but
lynn
swerved
aside
and
with
his
face
against
the
softness
of
his
mother
hair
wiped
away
a
boyish
tear
lynn
she
said
tenderly
you
are
very
young
how
old
were
you
when
you
married
mother
how
old
was
father
then
persisted
lynn
with
remorseless
logic
i
am
not
too
young
and
neither
is
iris
only
she
does
care
she
may
care
son
no
she
wo
she
despises
me
and
why
she
said
i
had
no
heart
the
idea
maybe
i
did
have
then
but
i
sure
i
have
now
he
walked
back
and
forth
restlessly
margaret
knew
that
the
griefs
of
youth
are
cruelly
keen
because
they
come
well
in
the
lead
of
the
strength
to
bear
them
she
was
about
to
offer
the
usual
threadbare
consolation
you
will
forget
in
time
when
she
remembered
the
stock
of
which
lynn
came
his
mother
who
had
carried
a
secret
wound
for
more
than
years
who
was
she
to
talk
about
forgetting
and
of
all
others
to
her
son
gratitude
was
still
dominant
though
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
knew
that
she
was
selfish
lynn
felt
the
lack
of
sympathy
and
became
conscious
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
her
tenderness
had
a
limit
mother
he
said
suddenly
did
you
love
father
why
do
you
ask
son
because
i
want
to
know
i
respected
him
highly
said
margaret
at
length
he
was
a
good
man
lynn
you
have
answered
he
returned
you
do
know
you
understand
but
i
do
understand
she
flashed
you
ca
if
you
did
love
father
i
i
cared
for
someone
else
said
margaret
thickly
unwilling
to
be
convicted
of
shallowness
lynn
looked
at
her
quickly
and
you
still
care
margaret
bowed
her
head
yes
she
whispered
i
still
care
mother
he
cried
in
an
instant
his
arms
were
around
her
and
she
was
sobbing
on
his
shoulder
mother
he
pleaded
forgive
me
to
think
i
never
knew
they
had
a
long
talk
then
intimate
and
searching
you
have
borne
it
bravely
he
said
no
one
has
ever
dreamed
of
it
i
am
sure
the
master
told
me
the
other
day
that
i
must
not
be
afraid
of
life
he
said
that
everything
even
our
blessings
came
to
us
through
pain
i
would
not
say
everything
temporised
margaret
but
it
is
true
that
much
comes
that
way
we
know
happiness
only
by
contrast
happiness
and
misery
light
and
dark
sunshine
and
storm
life
and
death
mused
lynn
yes
it
is
by
contrast
but
as
the
master
says
balance
swings
true
i
wish
you
knew
him
mother
he
has
helped
me
i
never
knew
my
father
so
it
is
not
wrong
for
me
to
say
that
i
wish
he
might
have
been
my
father
margaret
grew
as
cold
as
ice
and
her
senses
reeled
then
flame
swept
her
from
head
to
foot
come
she
said
not
knowing
her
own
voice
it
is
late
long
afterward
in
the
solitude
of
her
room
she
took
the
precious
thought
from
its
and
found
it
purest
gold
it
was
as
though
all
the
bitterness
in
her
heart
growing
upward
through
the
years
had
flowered
overnight
into
a
perfect
rose
xviii
lynn
comes
into
his
own
at
the
there
was
a
letter
for
irving
lynn
took
it
with
a
lump
rising
in
his
throat
for
though
he
had
never
seen
her
handwriting
he
knew
through
a
sixth
sense
that
it
was
from
iris
evidently
it
was
a
brief
communication
for
the
envelope
contained
not
more
than
a
single
sheet
the
straight
precise
slope
of
the
address
had
an
air
it
was
very
different
from
the
modern
angular
hand
which
demands
a
whole
line
for
two
or
three
words
in
some
way
it
brought
her
nearer
to
him
and
in
the
shadow
of
the
maple
just
outside
the
house
he
kissed
the
superscription
before
he
took
it
in
he
waited
consciously
while
his
mother
read
it
it
was
little
more
than
a
note
saying
that
she
was
established
in
a
hall
bedroom
in
a
city
where
she
had
the
use
of
the
piano
in
the
parlour
and
that
she
was
taking
two
lessons
a
week
and
practising
a
great
deal
she
gave
the
name
of
her
teacher
said
she
was
well
and
sent
kind
remembrances
to
all
who
might
inquire
for
her
with
a
woman
insight
margaret
read
heartache
between
the
lines
she
knew
that
the
note
was
brief
because
iris
did
not
dare
to
trust
herself
to
write
more
there
was
no
mention
of
lynn
but
it
was
not
because
she
had
forgotten
him
margaret
gave
the
letter
to
lynn
then
turned
away
that
she
might
not
see
his
face
i
shall
write
this
afternoon
she
said
shall
i
send
any
message
for
you
no
returned
lynn
with
a
short
bitter
laugh
i
have
no
message
to
send
her
heart
ached
in
sympathy
for
by
her
own
sorrow
she
measured
the
depth
of
his
she
knew
that
the
elasticity
of
youth
would
fail
here
that
lynn
was
not
of
those
who
forget
son
she
said
gently
i
wish
i
might
bear
it
for
you
i
would
let
you
mother
even
if
you
could
you
have
had
enough
as
it
is
herr
kaufmann
says
you
have
always
shielded
me
and
that
it
was
a
mistake
had
it
been
a
mistake
margaret
thought
it
over
after
lynn
went
away
she
had
shielded
him
that
was
true
he
had
never
learned
by
painful
experience
anything
from
which
she
had
the
power
to
save
him
if
his
father
had
lived
for
the
first
time
margaret
thought
of
her
freedom
as
a
doubtful
blessing
then
once
more
she
took
the
jewelled
thought
from
its
in
her
inmost
heart
there
was
no
hint
of
alloy
there
it
was
radiant
with
its
own
unspeakable
beauty
lynn
went
to
the
to
mail
the
letter
east
lancaster
considered
modern
innovations
which
were
reckless
and
unjustifiable
suppose
a
stranger
should
be
passing
through
east
lancaster
break
open
a
and
feloniously
extract
a
private
letter
what
if
the
box
should
blow
away
when
a
letter
was
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
accredited
representative
of
the
government
one
might
be
sure
that
it
was
safe
but
not
otherwise
doctor
brinkerhoff
was
talking
with
the
postmaster
but
he
left
him
to
speak
to
lynn
miss
iris
he
began
eagerly
you
have
perhaps
heard
from
her
yes
answered
lynn
dully
fingering
the
letter
is
she
quite
well
briefly
lynn
told
him
what
iris
had
written
it
was
kind
to
send
remembrances
to
all
who
might
inquire
mused
the
doctor
that
is
like
my
she
is
always
thinking
of
others
she
knew
that
i
would
be
the
first
to
ask
if
you
will
give
me
the
address
it
will
be
a
pleasure
to
me
to
write
to
her
she
must
be
quite
lonely
where
she
is
lynn
told
him
her
letter
was
at
home
but
every
syllable
of
it
even
the
prosaic
address
was
written
in
letters
of
fire
upon
his
brain
thank
you
said
the
doctor
as
he
took
it
down
in
his
memorandum
book
i
shall
write
shall
i
give
her
any
word
from
you
no
cried
lynn
ah
laughed
the
doctor
i
understand
you
write
yourself
well
i
will
tell
her
a
letter
is
coming
good
afternoon
he
moved
away
leaving
lynn
cold
from
head
to
foot
he
was
tempted
to
call
the
doctor
back
to
ask
him
not
to
mention
his
name
to
iris
then
he
reflected
that
an
explanation
would
be
necessary
in
any
event
iris
would
understand
she
would
know
that
he
did
not
intend
to
write
that
he
had
sent
no
message
but
three
days
later
it
was
fated
that
iris
should
tremble
at
the
sight
of
lynn
name
in
a
letter
from
east
lancaster
i
think
he
will
write
soon
doctor
brinkerhoff
had
said
irving
is
a
very
fine
gentleman
and
i
have
deep
respect
for
him
write
to
me
repeated
iris
he
would
not
dare
why
should
he
write
to
me
she
put
the
letter
aside
and
read
over
those
three
anonymous
communications
of
lynn
making
a
vain
effort
to
associate
them
with
his
personality
meanwhile
lynn
was
learning
endurance
he
slept
but
fitfully
awaking
always
with
the
sense
of
choking
and
of
a
hand
pulling
at
his
heart
he
saw
iris
everywhere
there
was
no
room
in
the
house
except
his
own
that
was
not
full
of
her
and
of
the
faint
elusive
perfume
which
seemed
a
part
of
her
sometimes
those
ghostly
images
haunted
him
until
he
could
bear
no
more
margaret
often
saw
him
throw
down
the
book
he
was
reading
and
dash
outdoors
for
an
hour
perhaps
he
had
not
turned
a
page
and
the
book
was
a
flimsy
pretence
at
best
he
had
not
touched
his
violin
since
iris
went
away
more
than
anything
else
it
spoke
to
him
of
her
trickster
with
the
violin
seemed
written
upon
it
for
all
the
world
to
read
dimly
he
knew
that
work
was
the
only
panacea
for
heartache
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
go
on
with
his
mechanical
practising
summer
was
drawing
to
its
close
already
there
was
a
single
scarlet
bough
in
the
maple
at
the
gate
where
the
frost
had
set
its
signal
and
its
promise
of
return
many
of
the
birds
had
gone
and
fairy
craft
of
winged
seeds
the
sport
of
every
wind
drifted
aimlessly
about
in
search
of
some
final
harbour
strangely
lynn
rather
avoided
his
mother
he
felt
her
sympathy
her
comprehension
and
yet
he
shrank
from
her
she
was
gentle
and
patient
responded
readily
to
his
every
mood
and
rarely
offered
a
caress
yet
he
continually
shrank
back
within
himself
he
had
made
no
friends
in
east
lancaster
though
he
knew
one
or
two
young
men
near
his
own
age
but
he
kept
so
far
aloof
from
them
that
they
had
long
since
ceased
to
seek
him
out
he
kept
away
from
doctor
brinkerhoff
fearing
talk
of
iris
or
some
new
complication
and
even
the
postmaster
kindly
sallies
fell
upon
deaf
ears
he
too
missed
iris
and
often
inquired
for
her
though
he
could
not
have
failed
to
note
that
no
letters
came
for
lynn
almost
in
the
first
of
the
hurt
when
it
seemed
the
hardest
to
bear
he
had
wondered
whether
it
could
be
any
worse
if
iris
were
dead
all
at
once
he
knew
that
it
would
be
that
the
cold
hand
and
the
quiet
heart
were
the
supreme
anguish
of
loving
because
there
was
no
longer
any
possibility
of
change
swiftly
he
understood
how
iris
had
felt
when
aunt
peace
died
and
he
stood
by
indifferent
and
unmoved
in
tardy
atonement
he
covered
the
grave
in
the
churchyard
with
flowers
the
goldenrod
and
purple
aster
that
marched
side
by
side
over
the
hills
to
meet
the
frost
gay
and
fearless
to
the
last
he
saw
himself
as
he
had
been
then
and
his
heart
grew
hot
with
shame
i
do
wonder
she
called
me
a
clod
he
said
to
himself
for
that
is
what
i
was
in
the
maze
of
darkness
through
which
he
somehow
lived
there
was
but
one
ray
of
comfort
the
master
lynn
felt
vaguely
that
here
was
something
upon
which
he
might
lean
he
did
not
perceive
that
it
was
his
own
individuality
which
herr
kaufmann
had
in
some
way
awakened
so
prone
are
we
to
confuse
the
person
with
the
thing
the
thought
with
the
deed
day
after
day
he
tramped
over
the
hills
around
east
lancaster
day
by
day
footsore
and
weary
he
sought
for
peace
along
those
sunlit
fields
at
night
desperately
tired
and
faint
with
hunger
he
crept
home
where
he
slept
uneasily
waking
always
with
that
hand
of
terror
clutching
at
his
heart
he
went
most
frequently
to
the
pile
of
rocks
in
the
woods
a
mile
or
more
from
the
house
there
were
no
signs
upon
the
bare
earth
around
it
seemingly
no
one
went
there
but
lynn
yet
the
suggestion
of
an
altar
was
openly
made
from
the
wide
ledge
at
the
foundation
where
one
might
kneel
to
the
cross
at
the
summit
rude
stern
and
forbidding
chiselled
in
the
rock
here
many
times
lynn
had
found
comfort
someone
else
whose
heart
swelled
burned
and
tried
to
escape
had
cut
that
cross
upon
the
granite
thus
he
came
by
slow
degrees
into
an
intimate
invisible
companionship
herr
kaufmann
had
ceased
to
speak
of
lessons
though
lynn
went
there
sometimes
and
sat
by
while
he
worked
the
master
had
admitted
him
to
that
high
fellowship
which
does
not
demand
speech
for
an
hour
or
more
lynn
might
sit
there
watching
and
yet
no
word
would
be
spoken
as
with
brinkerhoff
there
were
occasional
visits
in
which
nothing
was
said
but
good
afternoon
and
fräulein
fredrika
was
always
busy
overhead
with
her
manifold
household
tasks
and
seldom
disturbed
them
by
coming
into
the
shop
lynn
wondered
if
the
house
was
never
clean
and
once
put
the
question
to
herr
kaufmann
mine
house
is
always
clean
he
answered
except
down
here
twice
in
every
year
i
allow
fredrika
to
come
in
mine
shop
with
her
cloths
and
her
brush
and
her
pails
the
rest
of
the
time
it
is
mine
own
if
she
could
clean
here
all
the
time
as
upstairs
i
think
she
would
be
more
happy
if
you
like
to
come
in
mine
shop
when
i
am
not
here
i
am
willing
it
is
one
quiet
place
where
one
can
rest
undisturbed
and
think
of
many
things
fredrika
would
not
care
weeks
later
lynn
thought
of
the
kindly
offer
a
storm
was
coming
up
and
he
remembered
that
the
master
had
spoken
of
driving
to
another
town
with
brinkerhoff
i
have
one
violin
he
had
explained
which
was
ordered
long
ago
and
which
is
now
finished
while
the
herr
doctor
visits
the
sick
i
will
go
on
with
mine
instrument
and
perhaps
obtain
one
more
pupil
fräulein
fredrika
answered
his
ring
and
he
asked
conventionally
for
herr
kaufmann
mine
brudder
is
not
home
she
said
he
will
have
gone
away
but
i
think
not
for
long
you
will
perhaps
come
in
and
wait
i
will
not
disturb
you
replied
lynn
i
will
go
down
in
the
shop
but
no
returned
the
fräulein
coaxingly
will
you
not
stay
with
me
i
am
with
the
loneliness
when
mine
brudder
is
away
you
will
sit
with
me
yes
it
will
be
most
kind
thus
entreated
he
could
not
refuse
and
he
sat
down
in
the
parlour
awkward
and
ill
at
ease
his
hostess
at
once
proceeded
to
entertain
him
you
think
it
will
rain
yes
she
asked
yes
i
think
so
well
i
do
not
returned
the
fräulein
smiling
i
always
think
the
best
let
us
wait
and
see
which
is
right
we
need
rain
objected
lynn
turning
uneasily
in
his
chair
but
not
when
mine
brudder
is
out
he
and
the
herr
doctor
will
have
gone
for
a
long
drive
mine
brudder
have
finished
one
fine
violin
and
the
herr
doctor
will
visit
the
sick
mine
brudder
friend
possesses
great
skill
lynn
looked
moodily
past
her
and
out
of
the
window
the
fräulein
changed
her
tactics
you
have
not
seen
mine
new
she
suggested
no
returned
lynn
unthinkingly
i
have
then
i
will
get
him
she
came
back
presently
and
put
it
into
lynn
hand
it
was
made
of
three
strands
of
heavy
rope
braided
looped
to
form
a
handle
tied
with
a
blue
ribbon
and
ravelled
at
the
ends
see
she
said
is
it
not
most
beautiful
yes
agreed
lynn
absently
miss
iris
have
told
me
how
to
make
him
lynn
came
to
himself
with
a
start
and
this
she
went
on
pointing
to
the
gilded
that
hung
under
the
swinging
lamp
and
this
but
no
it
is
you
who
have
made
this
for
me
miss
iris
showed
you
how
she
pointed
to
the
butterfly
made
so
long
ago
but
still
in
its
pristine
glory
he
said
nothing
but
by
his
face
fräulein
fredrika
saw
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
that
she
had
somehow
been
clumsy
after
all
it
was
very
difficult
this
conversing
with
gentlemen
franz
was
easy
to
get
along
with
but
the
others
she
shook
her
head
in
despair
and
immediately
relinquished
the
thought
of
entertaining
lynn
she
could
not
tell
him
that
she
had
changed
her
mind
that
she
no
longer
wanted
him
to
sit
with
her
and
that
he
could
go
down
in
the
shop
to
wait
for
herr
kaufmann
painfully
in
the
silence
she
considered
several
expedients
and
at
last
her
face
brightened
now
that
you
are
here
she
said
to
guard
mine
house
it
will
be
of
a
possibility
for
me
to
go
out
for
some
vegetables
for
mine
dinner
he
will
have
been
very
hungry
from
his
long
ride
and
you
see
it
is
not
going
to
rain
you
will
excuse
me
for
a
short
time
yes
gladly
answered
lynn
with
sincerity
then
i
need
not
fear
to
go
it
will
be
most
kind
she
had
been
gone
but
a
few
minutes
when
the
storm
broke
lynn
saw
the
wild
rain
sweep
across
the
valley
with
a
sense
of
peaceful
security
which
was
quite
new
to
him
for
some
time
now
he
would
be
alone
alone
and
yet
sheltered
from
the
storm
very
often
after
a
deep
experience
one
looks
upon
the
inanimate
things
which
were
present
at
the
beginning
of
it
with
wondering
curiosity
the
crazy
jug
the
purple
tidy
embroidered
with
pink
roses
and
the
gilded
which
swung
back
and
forth
when
the
wind
shook
the
house
were
strangely
linked
with
destiny
here
he
had
thoughtlessly
touched
the
cremona
and
for
the
time
being
made
an
enemy
of
the
fräulein
her
dislike
of
him
abated
only
when
he
and
iris
made
her
the
hideous
paper
butterfly
which
illuminated
a
corner
a
flash
of
memory
took
him
back
to
the
day
they
made
it
alone
in
the
big
he
saw
the
sweet
seriousness
in
the
girl
face
as
she
glued
on
the
antennæ
having
chosen
proper
bits
of
an
old
ostrich
feather
for
the
purpose
and
now
the
was
empty
save
of
the
haunting
shadows
aunt
peace
was
at
rest
in
the
churchyard
the
fever
at
an
end
and
iris
iris
had
gone
leaving
desolation
in
her
wake
only
the
butterfly
remained
the
flimsy
fragile
thing
that
any
passing
wind
might
easily
have
destroyed
the
finer
things
of
the
spirit
that
are
supposed
to
be
permanent
had
vanished
in
their
place
there
was
only
a
heartache
which
waxed
greater
as
the
days
went
by
and
through
the
long
nights
which
brought
no
surcease
of
pain
in
the
beginning
lynn
had
felt
himself
absolutely
alone
now
he
began
to
perceive
that
he
had
been
taken
into
an
invisible
brotherhood
he
was
like
one
in
a
crowded
playhouse
when
the
lights
go
out
isolated
to
all
intents
and
purposes
and
yet
conscious
that
others
are
near
him
sharing
his
emotions
the
thunders
boomed
across
the
valley
and
the
lightnings
rived
the
clouds
the
grey
rain
swirled
against
the
windows
and
the
house
swayed
in
the
wind
then
almost
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
the
storm
ceased
and
lynn
smiled
diamonds
dripped
from
every
twig
and
the
grass
was
full
of
them
the
laughter
of
happy
children
came
to
his
ears
and
a
rainbow
of
living
light
spanned
the
valley
its
floating
draperies
overhung
the
topmost
branches
of
the
trees
on
the
crest
of
the
opposite
hill
and
picked
out
here
and
there
a
jewel
a
ruby
an
opal
or
an
emerald
set
in
the
silvered
framework
of
the
leaves
lynn
sighed
heavily
for
the
beauty
of
it
sent
the
old
remorseless
pain
to
surging
through
his
heart
the
master
violin
lay
on
the
piano
near
him
and
he
took
it
up
noting
only
that
it
was
not
the
cremona
as
his
fingers
touched
the
strings
there
came
a
sense
of
familiarity
with
the
instrument
as
one
who
meets
a
friend
after
a
long
separation
he
tightened
the
strings
picked
up
the
bow
and
began
to
play
it
was
the
adagio
movement
of
the
concerto
the
one
which
herr
kaufmann
had
said
was
full
of
heartache
and
tears
in
all
the
literature
of
music
there
was
nothing
so
well
suited
to
his
mood
he
stood
with
his
face
to
the
window
his
eyes
still
fixed
upon
the
rainbow
and
deep
quivering
tunes
came
from
the
violin
in
an
instant
lynn
recognised
his
mastery
he
was
playing
as
the
great
had
played
before
him
with
passion
and
with
infinite
pain
all
the
beauty
of
the
world
was
a
part
of
it
the
sun
the
wide
fields
of
clover
and
the
summer
rain
moonlight
and
the
sound
of
many
waters
the
unutterable
midnights
of
the
universe
iris
and
the
beauty
of
the
marshes
where
her
like
a
thread
of
purple
embroidered
a
royal
tapestry
beyond
this
still
was
the
beauty
of
the
spirit
which
believes
all
things
suffers
all
things
and
triumphs
at
last
through
its
suffering
and
its
belief
primal
forces
spoke
through
the
adagio
swelling
into
splendid
chords
love
and
night
and
death
it
was
the
cry
of
a
soul
in
bondage
straining
to
be
free
struggling
to
break
the
chain
and
take
its
place
by
right
of
its
knowledge
and
its
compassion
with
those
who
have
learned
to
live
lynn
was
quivering
like
an
aspen
in
a
storm
and
he
breathed
heavily
through
the
majestic
crescendo
came
that
deathless
message
endure
and
thou
shalt
triumph
wait
and
thou
shalt
see
like
an
undercurrent
too
was
the
inseparable
mystery
of
pain
under
the
spell
of
the
music
he
saw
it
all
the
wide
working
of
the
law
which
takes
no
account
of
the
finite
because
it
deals
with
the
infinite
which
takes
no
heed
of
the
individual
because
it
guards
us
all
far
removed
from
its
personal
significance
his
grief
became
his
friend
the
keynote
the
password
the
countersign
admitting
him
to
that
vast
valhalla
where
the
shining
souls
of
the
immortals
outgrowing
defeat
have
put
on
the
garments
of
victory
sunset
took
the
rainbow
and
made
it
into
flame
once
more
lynn
played
the
adagio
instinct
with
its
story
voicing
its
law
he
was
so
keenly
alive
that
the
strings
cut
into
his
fingers
yet
he
played
on
fully
comprehending
fully
believing
through
the
splendid
chords
of
the
crescendo
to
the
end
then
there
was
a
faltering
step
upon
the
stair
a
fumbling
at
the
latch
and
someone
staggered
into
the
room
it
was
the
master
blind
with
tears
his
loved
cremona
in
his
outstretched
hands
here
he
cried
brokenly
son
of
mine
heart
play
xix
the
secret
chamber
he
loves
her
still
the
memory
of
the
words
carried
balm
to
sore
heart
there
could
be
no
mistake
for
doctor
brinkerhoff
had
been
positive
it
was
absolutely
beautifully
true
believing
all
the
time
that
he
had
forgotten
she
was
now
proved
false
swiftly
upon
the
thought
came
another
which
sent
the
blood
to
her
face
in
all
the
time
she
had
been
in
east
lancaster
she
had
feared
that
he
might
in
some
way
learn
of
her
presence
and
now
there
was
nothing
she
desired
so
much
had
aunt
peace
lived
she
would
scarcely
have
dared
to
continue
the
acquaintance
for
like
doctor
brinkerhoff
the
master
was
without
social
position
iris
too
had
gone
no
one
need
know
but
lynn
herr
kaufmann
did
not
know
the
name
of
the
man
she
had
married
and
he
thought
lynn
mother
a
stranger
it
would
be
very
simple
to
write
the
master
a
note
saying
that
he
had
been
so
good
to
lynn
and
had
done
so
much
for
him
that
his
mother
would
like
to
express
her
appreciation
personally
and
end
by
asking
him
to
call
but
would
the
old
promise
still
keep
him
away
as
though
it
were
yesterday
margaret
remembered
her
mother
as
she
sternly
demanded
from
franz
his
promise
never
to
enter
the
house
again
and
franz
was
one
who
always
kept
his
word
then
she
reflected
that
on
the
day
when
aunt
peace
received
guests
for
the
last
time
he
had
been
there
in
that
very
house
with
the
cremona
which
had
separated
them
in
the
beginning
and
years
later
so
strangely
brought
them
together
doctor
brinkerhoff
had
asked
permission
to
bring
his
friend
and
it
would
be
so
simple
to
give
it
so
easy
to
say
doctor
it
would
give
me
pleasure
to
meet
your
friend
herr
kaufmann
will
you
not
bring
him
with
you
next
wednesday
evening
but
after
all
the
years
all
the
sorrow
that
lay
between
them
would
she
wish
doctor
brinkerhoff
to
be
there
was
it
not
also
taking
an
unfair
advantage
of
the
master
to
send
for
him
and
then
suddenly
confront
him
with
his
sweetheart
of
long
ago
margaret
put
the
plan
aside
without
further
thought
and
lynn
would
she
wish
lynn
to
bring
herr
kaufmann
would
she
want
her
son
to
tell
him
that
she
was
the
woman
he
had
loved
in
vain
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
margaret
flushed
crimson
as
she
imagined
the
meeting
lynn
did
not
know
that
it
was
the
master
only
that
she
had
cared
for
someone
whom
she
did
not
marry
would
she
wish
lynn
to
stand
by
surprised
and
perhaps
troubled
her
heart
answered
no
the
note
too
would
be
an
unfair
advantage
he
would
not
know
margaret
irving
and
she
could
not
well
write
that
they
had
once
loved
each
other
after
all
she
had
only
doctor
brinkerhoff
word
for
it
and
he
might
be
mistaken
even
the
master
might
be
labouring
under
a
delusion
might
only
think
he
cared
the
are
often
pathetic
between
those
who
have
loved
in
youth
circumstance
parts
two
who
vow
undying
devotion
and
one
perhaps
remains
faithful
while
the
other
forgets
sometimes
both
marry
elsewhere
each
with
the
other
image
securely
hidden
in
those
secret
chambers
of
the
heart
which
twilight
and
music
serve
best
to
open
time
that
kindly
magician
softens
the
harsh
outlines
eliminates
every
defect
and
by
his
wondrous
alchemy
transmutes
the
real
to
the
ideal
thus
in
one
inmost
soul
is
enshrined
the
old
love
with
countless
other
precious
things
rue
lies
at
the
threshold
for
regret
like
a
sentinel
guards
the
door
and
to
enter
one
must
first
make
peace
with
regret
the
labyrinthine
passages
are
hung
with
shining
fabrics
woven
of
dreams
the
floor
is
deeply
hidden
with
rosemary
that
homely
fragrant
herb
which
means
remembrance
the
light
is
that
of
a
window
where
the
sun
streams
through
many
colours
and
illumines
the
utmost
recesses
with
a
rainbow
gleam
costly
vessels
are
there
holding
heart
desire
which
must
wait
for
its
fulfilment
until
immortal
dawn
heart
belief
is
in
a
chest
laid
away
with
lavender
but
the
lock
is
rusty
and
does
not
readily
yield
heart
love
sweet
with
spikenard
waits
near
the
door
so
eager
to
pass
the
threshold
where
stands
regret
memory
jewels
are
there
in
many
a
casket
of
cunning
workmanship
where
the
dust
never
lies
emeralds
made
of
the
green
pastures
and
the
still
waters
sapphires
that
were
born
of
sun
and
sea
topazes
of
the
golden
glow
that
comes
after
a
rain
diamonds
of
the
white
light
of
noon
rubies
that
have
stolen
their
colour
from
the
warm
blood
of
the
heart
gladly
giving
its
deepest
love
amethysts
made
of
dead
violets
still
hinting
that
perishable
fragrance
which
perhaps
like
a
single
precious
drop
still
lives
within
forever
out
of
the
reach
of
decay
opals
made
from
changeful
flame
of
irised
fancies
that
lived
but
for
the
space
of
a
thought
then
passed
away
linked
together
by
a
thousand
perfect
moments
these
jewels
of
memory
wait
for
the
quiet
hour
when
one
fingers
lift
them
from
their
and
one
eyes
forgetting
tears
shine
with
the
old
joy
the
petals
of
crimson
roses
long
since
crushed
and
dead
rustle
softly
from
the
shadow
when
the
door
of
the
secret
chamber
opens
melodies
start
from
the
silence
and
breathe
the
haunting
measures
of
some
lost
song
letters
ragged
and
worn
with
the
tint
of
old
ivory
upon
their
eloquent
pages
whisper
still
i
love
you
though
the
hand
that
penned
the
tender
message
has
long
since
been
folded
with
its
mate
upon
the
quiet
heart
when
the
world
has
proved
forbidding
when
love
has
been
unresponsive
and
friendship
has
failed
one
steals
to
the
secret
chamber
with
a
sense
of
sanctuary
past
regret
stern
unyielding
and
austere
one
goes
silently
having
given
the
password
and
enters
in
the
fragrant
herbs
and
the
rose
petals
bring
balm
to
the
tired
heart
that
heart
which
has
loved
so
vainly
has
tried
so
faithfully
and
failed
the
ghosts
of
dreams
woven
in
the
tapestries
that
hide
the
walls
come
back
to
touch
the
roughened
fingers
of
the
one
who
followed
out
the
pattern
in
the
midst
of
blinding
tears
all
the
music
that
has
soothed
and
comforted
trembles
once
more
from
muted
strings
the
hands
made
old
and
hard
by
unselfish
toil
become
fair
and
smooth
at
a
lover
kiss
of
long
ago
after
an
hour
in
the
secret
chamber
when
mnemosyne
singing
brings
forth
her
treasures
one
goes
back
serene
and
fearless
to
meet
whatever
may
come
margaret
came
from
her
secret
chamber
with
a
smile
upon
her
lips
in
that
one
hour
she
had
finally
parted
with
all
bitterness
all
sense
of
loss
after
years
of
heart
hunger
and
disappointment
she
had
put
it
all
aside
and
come
into
her
heritage
of
content
she
began
to
consider
herr
kaufmann
again
after
all
what
was
there
to
be
gained
she
might
be
disappointed
in
him
or
he
might
be
disillusioned
in
regard
to
her
she
remembered
what
a
friend
had
once
told
her
years
ago
my
dear
she
had
said
there
is
one
thing
in
my
life
for
which
i
have
never
ceased
to
be
thankful
when
i
was
very
young
i
fell
in
love
with
a
boy
of
my
own
age
and
our
parents
by
separating
us
kept
us
from
making
a
hasty
marriage
i
did
not
forget
but
later
i
met
a
man
who
was
much
better
suited
to
me
in
every
way
whom
i
liked
and
thoroughly
respected
and
of
whom
my
mother
approved
but
secretly
i
cherished
this
old
love
until
one
day
a
lucky
chance
brought
me
face
to
face
with
him
in
an
instant
the
whole
thing
was
gone
and
i
laughed
at
my
folly
laughed
because
i
was
free
i
married
the
other
and
i
have
been
a
very
happy
wife
far
happier
than
i
should
have
been
had
i
continued
to
believe
myself
in
love
with
a
memory
there
was
truth
in
it
margaret
reflected
she
went
over
to
her
mirror
and
sat
down
before
it
to
study
her
face
she
was
and
the
bloom
of
youth
was
gone
the
grey
threads
at
her
temples
and
around
her
low
brow
softened
her
face
where
time
had
left
the
prints
of
his
passing
her
eyes
that
had
once
been
merry
were
sad
now
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
drooped
a
little
she
turned
away
from
the
mirror
with
a
sigh
wondering
if
after
all
the
dreams
were
not
the
best
moreover
the
womanly
instinct
asserted
itself
to
be
sought
and
never
to
do
the
seeking
to
hold
one
self
high
and
apart
to
be
earned
but
never
given
this
feeling
so
long
in
abeyance
returned
to
its
rightful
place
when
the
years
bring
wisdom
one
learns
to
leave
many
problems
to
their
own
working
out
margaret
determined
not
to
interfere
with
the
complex
undercurrents
which
like
subterranean
rivers
lie
beneath
our
daily
living
it
might
happen
or
it
might
not
but
she
would
not
seek
to
control
the
subtle
forces
which
forever
work
secretly
toward
the
fulfilling
of
the
law
to
live
on
from
day
to
day
making
the
best
of
it
this
is
a
simple
creed
but
no
one
yet
has
found
it
unsatisfactory
lynn
came
in
and
went
straight
to
his
room
margaret
heard
him
walking
back
and
forth
as
if
in
search
of
something
he
tuned
his
violin
and
she
rejoiced
because
at
last
he
had
turned
to
his
practise
but
it
was
not
practising
that
she
heard
it
was
the
concerto
every
measure
of
which
she
knew
by
heart
with
the
first
notes
she
felt
a
new
authority
a
new
grasp
and
began
to
wonder
if
it
were
really
lynn
she
leaned
forward
her
body
tense
to
listen
when
he
came
to
the
adagio
the
hot
tears
blinded
her
lynn
her
boy
to
play
like
this
her
mother
heart
beat
high
in
an
ecstasy
of
gratitude
for
the
full
payment
the
granting
of
her
heart
desire
the
deep
tones
stirred
her
very
soul
the
passion
of
it
made
her
tremble
the
beauty
of
it
made
her
afraid
wondering
she
saw
the
working
out
of
it
that
at
the
very
hour
when
she
had
surrendered
had
given
up
had
cast
aside
her
bitterness
forever
lynn
had
come
into
his
own
with
splendid
dignity
with
exquisite
phrasing
with
masterful
interpretation
the
concerto
moved
to
its
end
it
left
her
faint
her
heart
wildly
beating
through
lynn
franz
had
worked
out
her
salvation
her
atonement
through
lynn
full
payment
had
been
made
when
he
came
out
of
his
room
she
was
in
the
hall
her
face
alight
with
her
great
happiness
lynn
she
cried
a
world
of
meaning
was
in
the
name
i
know
he
returned
but
all
the
youth
was
gone
out
of
his
voice
at
once
she
realised
that
he
had
crossed
the
dividing
line
that
even
to
her
he
was
no
longer
a
child
but
a
man
he
went
past
her
walked
downstairs
slowly
and
went
out
poor
lad
she
murmured
poor
soul
lynn
too
had
paid
the
price
was
it
needful
that
both
should
pay
but
none
the
less
the
fact
remained
the
boon
had
been
granted
and
full
payment
made
in
each
instance
the
same
payment
she
had
paid
with
long
years
of
which
only
now
had
ceased
lynn
years
still
lay
before
him
a
sob
choked
her
was
not
the
price
too
high
must
he
bear
what
she
had
borne
for
these
five
and
twenty
years
with
all
the
passion
of
her
motherhood
she
yearned
to
shield
him
to
eke
out
in
the
remainder
of
her
days
the
remorseless
balance
against
lynn
but
in
the
working
of
that
law
there
is
no
discrimination
the
price
is
fixed
and
unalterable
the
payment
merciless
and
sure
there
is
no
escape
for
the
individual
it
is
continually
the
sacrifice
of
the
one
for
the
many
the
part
for
the
whole
try
as
she
would
margaret
could
not
go
back
she
could
not
for
sake
take
up
the
burden
she
had
laid
down
in
the
futile
effort
to
bear
more
from
her
no
more
would
be
accepted
so
much
was
plain
the
rest
must
come
from
lynn
her
heart
ached
for
him
but
there
was
nothing
she
could
do
except
to
stand
aside
and
watch
while
his
broad
shoulders
grew
accustomed
to
their
load
a
wild
impulse
seized
her
to
go
to
the
city
find
iris
bring
her
back
even
unwillingly
and
literally
force
her
to
marry
lynn
but
that
was
not
what
lynn
wanted
and
margaret
herself
had
been
forced
into
a
marriage
clearly
at
last
she
saw
that
she
must
remain
passive
and
cultivate
resignation
the
hours
went
by
and
lynn
did
not
return
she
well
knew
the
mood
in
which
he
had
gone
away
at
night
and
weary
with
his
eyes
gleaming
strangely
he
would
come
back
refuse
to
eat
and
lock
himself
into
his
room
it
had
been
so
for
a
long
time
and
it
would
be
so
until
through
the
slow
working
of
the
inner
forces
he
stepped
over
the
boundary
that
his
mother
had
just
crossed
white
noon
ascended
the
arch
of
the
heavens
blazed
a
moment
at
the
zenith
and
then
went
on
the
golden
hours
followed
each
one
making
the
shadows
a
little
longer
the
earth
more
radiant
if
that
could
be
upon
the
hills
were
set
the
seals
of
the
frost
every
maple
robed
in
glory
had
taken
on
the
garments
of
royalty
the
air
shimmered
with
the
amethystine
haze
of
indian
summer
that
veil
of
luminous
mist
vibrant
with
colour
which
autumn
weaves
on
her
loom
margaret
went
out
leaving
the
door
ajar
for
lynn
there
were
few
keys
in
east
lancaster
a
locked
door
was
discourteous
a
reflection
upon
the
integrity
of
one
neighbours
from
the
elms
the
yellow
leaves
were
dropping
like
telegrams
from
the
high
places
saying
that
summer
had
gone
she
turned
at
the
corner
and
went
east
the
long
light
throwing
her
shadow
well
before
her
it
is
like
life
she
mused
smiling
we
go
through
it
following
shadows
things
that
vanish
when
there
is
a
shifting
of
the
light
across
the
clover
fields
where
the
dried
blossoms
stirred
in
their
sleep
as
she
passed
through
the
upland
pastures
stony
and
barren
with
the
pools
overgrown
through
a
fallow
field
shorn
of
its
harvest
where
only
the
tiny
spread
their
webs
amidst
the
stubble
margaret
way
was
all
familiar
and
yet
sadly
changed
a
the
last
one
of
his
kind
winged
a
leisurely
way
southward
singing
as
he
flew
a
squirrel
flaunted
his
bushy
tail
gave
her
a
daring
backward
glance
and
scurried
up
a
tree
she
laughed
and
paused
at
the
entrance
to
the
forest
once
she
had
stood
there
thrilled
to
her
inmost
soul
again
she
had
waited
there
white
to
the
lips
with
pain
now
she
had
outgrown
it
had
learned
peace
and
the
long
years
slipped
away
each
with
its
own
burden
the
wood
was
exquisitely
still
a
nut
dropped
now
and
then
and
a
belated
bird
called
to
its
mate
the
swift
patter
of
fairy
feet
echoed
and
through
the
long
aisles
the
air
was
crystalline
yet
full
of
colour
and
the
gold
and
crimson
leaves
floated
idly
back
and
forth
it
needed
only
a
passing
wind
at
the
right
moment
and
from
the
right
place
to
make
a
rainbow
then
and
there
she
went
farther
into
the
wood
with
a
sense
of
friendliness
for
the
way
just
at
the
turn
of
the
path
she
stopped
amazed
at
their
where
the
wide
rock
was
laid
at
the
foot
of
the
oak
someone
had
reared
an
altar
and
blazoned
a
cross
upon
the
stone
her
eyes
filled
for
she
knew
who
had
made
it
that
symbol
of
sacrifice
and
it
must
have
stood
for
the
whole
of
the
five
and
twenty
years
there
was
no
word
no
inscription
only
the
cross
but
for
her
it
was
enough
to
kiss
the
cross
sweetheart
to
kiss
the
cross
the
last
measures
of
the
song
reverberated
through
her
memory
as
iris
had
sung
it
in
her
deep
contralto
so
long
ago
sobbing
she
knelt
with
her
lips
against
the
symbol
then
suddenly
started
to
her
feet
for
there
was
a
step
upon
the
path
for
a
blinding
instant
they
faced
each
other
unbelieving
then
the
master
opened
his
arms
beloved
he
breathed
is
it
thou
xx
mine
brudder
friend
that
day
the
master
put
aside
the
garment
of
his
years
the
quarter
century
that
had
lain
between
them
like
a
thorny
upward
path
was
suddenly
blotted
out
and
only
the
memory
of
it
remained
belated
but
none
the
less
keen
the
primeval
joy
came
back
to
him
youth
and
love
the
bounding
pulse
and
the
singing
heart
they
were
all
his
it
was
twilight
when
they
came
away
from
the
altar
in
the
forest
his
arm
around
his
sweetheart
and
the
faces
of
both
wet
with
happy
tears
until
mine
liebchen
he
said
how
shall
i
now
wait
for
that
when
we
part
no
more
the
dear
god
knew
he
gave
to
me
the
cutting
and
the
long
night
that
in
the
end
i
might
deserve
thee
he
was
making
of
me
an
instrument
suited
to
thy
little
hand
he
kissed
the
hand
as
he
spoke
and
margaret
eyes
filled
once
more
through
the
mist
of
her
tears
she
saw
the
rising
moon
rocking
idly
just
above
the
horizon
see
said
the
master
it
is
a
new
light
from
the
east
from
the
same
place
as
thou
hast
come
to
me
many
a
time
have
i
watched
it
thinking
that
it
also
shone
on
thee
that
perhaps
thy
eyes
as
well
as
mine
were
upon
it
and
thus
through
heaven
we
were
united
those
whom
god
hath
joined
together
murmured
margaret
let
no
man
put
asunder
those
whom
god
hath
joined
returned
the
master
reverently
no
man
can
put
asunder
dost
thou
not
see
i
thought
thou
hadst
forgotten
and
when
i
go
to
keep
mine
tryst
with
grief
i
find
thee
there
with
thy
lips
upon
the
cross
i
have
never
gone
before
whispered
margaret
i
could
not
so
mine
beloved
i
have
gone
there
many
times
when
mine
sorrow
has
filled
mine
old
heart
to
breaking
i
have
gone
there
that
i
might
look
upon
thy
cross
and
mine
and
so
gain
strength
it
is
where
we
parted
where
thy
lips
were
last
on
mine
sometimes
i
have
gone
with
mine
cremona
and
played
until
mine
sore
heart
was
at
peace
and
i
find
thee
there
the
dear
father
has
been
most
kind
did
you
know
me
asked
margaret
shyly
have
i
not
grown
old
mine
liebchen
thou
canst
never
grow
old
thou
hast
the
beauty
of
immortal
youth
as
i
saw
thee
so
have
i
seen
thee
in
mine
dream
sometimes
i
have
felt
that
thou
hadst
taken
up
thy
passing
and
i
have
hungered
for
mine
for
it
was
a
certainty
in
mine
heart
that
the
dear
father
would
give
thee
back
to
me
in
heaven
i
do
not
think
of
heaven
as
the
glittering
place
with
the
streets
of
gold
and
the
walls
of
pearl
but
more
like
one
quiet
wood
where
the
grass
is
green
and
the
little
brook
sings
all
day
i
have
thought
of
heaven
as
the
place
where
those
who
love
shall
be
together
free
from
all
misunderstanding
or
the
thought
of
parting
the
great
ones
say
that
man
own
need
gives
him
his
conception
of
the
dear
god
that
if
he
needs
the
avenging
angel
so
is
god
to
him
that
if
he
needs
but
the
friend
that
will
god
be
and
so
in
mine
dream
of
heaven
because
it
was
mine
need
i
have
thought
of
it
but
as
one
sunny
field
where
there
was
clover
in
the
long
grass
and
tall
trees
at
one
side
with
the
clear
shining
waters
beyond
where
we
might
quench
our
thirst
and
thee
beside
me
forever
with
thy
little
hand
in
mine
and
now
because
i
have
paid
mine
price
i
do
not
have
to
wait
until
i
am
dead
for
mine
heaven
the
dear
god
gives
it
to
me
here
whatever
heaven
may
be
said
margaret
thrilled
to
the
utmost
depths
of
her
soul
it
can
be
no
more
than
this
nor
different
answered
the
master
drawing
her
closer
i
think
it
is
like
this
without
the
fear
of
parting
parting
repeated
margaret
with
a
rush
of
tears
oh
do
not
speak
of
parting
mine
beloved
said
the
master
and
his
voice
was
very
tender
there
is
nothing
perfect
here
there
must
always
be
parting
if
it
were
not
so
we
should
have
no
need
of
heaven
but
to
the
end
of
the
road
thou
and
i
will
go
together
see
in
the
beginning
we
were
upon
separate
paths
and
after
so
long
a
time
the
ways
met
for
a
little
space
we
journeyed
together
and
because
of
it
the
sun
was
more
bright
the
flowers
more
sweet
the
road
more
easy
then
comes
the
hard
place
and
the
ways
divide
but
though
the
leagues
lie
between
us
and
we
do
not
see
we
go
always
at
the
same
pace
and
so
in
a
way
together
we
learn
the
same
things
we
think
the
same
things
we
suffer
the
same
things
because
we
were
of
those
whom
the
dear
god
hath
joined
another
walks
beside
thee
and
yet
not
with
thee
because
through
all
the
distance
thou
art
mine
and
so
we
go
until
thy
road
is
turned
thou
dost
not
know
it
is
turned
because
the
circle
is
so
great
thou
canst
not
see
little
dost
thou
dream
thou
art
soon
to
meet
again
with
thy
old
franz
through
the
thicket
meanwhile
i
am
going
and
mine
way
is
hard
and
set
with
brambles
it
is
only
mine
blind
faith
which
helps
me
onward
that
and
the
vision
in
mine
heart
of
thee
which
never
for
a
day
nor
even
for
an
hour
hath
been
absent
one
day
mine
road
turns
too
and
there
art
thou
mine
beloved
leading
by
the
hand
mine
son
margaret
was
sobbing
her
face
hidden
against
his
shoulder
mine
liebchen
it
is
not
for
me
to
bear
thy
tears
much
can
i
endure
but
not
that
after
the
long
waiting
i
have
thee
close
again
thou
and
mine
son
the
tall
young
fellow
with
the
honest
face
and
the
laughing
ways
who
have
made
of
himself
one
artist
the
way
lies
long
before
us
but
it
is
toward
the
west
and
sunset
hath
already
begun
to
come
upon
the
clouds
but
until
the
end
we
go
together
thy
little
hand
in
mine
some
day
beloved
when
the
ways
part
once
more
and
thou
or
i
shall
be
called
to
follow
the
grey
angel
into
the
darkness
i
think
we
shall
not
fear
perhaps
we
shall
be
very
weary
and
the
one
will
be
glad
because
the
other
has
come
into
the
great
rest
but
beloved
thou
knowest
that
if
it
is
i
who
must
follow
the
grey
angel
and
still
leave
thee
on
the
dusty
road
alone
mine
grave
will
be
no
division
life
hath
not
taught
me
not
to
love
thee
with
all
mine
soul
and
death
shall
not
life
is
the
positive
and
death
is
the
negation
shall
death
then
do
something
more
than
life
can
do
oh
mine
liebchen
do
not
fear
the
autumn
mists
were
rising
and
the
stars
gleamed
faintly
like
points
of
pearl
at
the
bridge
they
said
good
night
and
margaret
went
on
home
wishing
even
then
that
she
might
bear
the
burden
for
lynn
the
master
went
up
the
hill
with
his
blood
singing
in
his
veins
fredrika
thought
him
unusually
abstracted
but
strangely
happy
and
until
long
past
midnight
he
sat
by
the
window
improvising
upon
the
cremona
a
theme
of
such
passionate
beauty
that
the
heart
within
her
trembled
and
was
afraid
that
night
fredrika
dreamed
that
someone
had
parted
her
from
franz
and
when
she
woke
her
pillow
was
wet
with
tears
it
was
not
until
the
next
afternoon
that
he
realised
that
he
must
tell
her
after
long
puzzling
over
the
problem
he
went
to
doctor
brinkerhoff
the
doctor
was
out
and
did
not
return
until
almost
sunset
when
he
came
the
master
was
sitting
in
the
same
uncomfortable
chair
that
with
monumental
patience
he
had
occupied
for
hours
mine
friend
said
the
master
with
solemn
joy
look
in
mine
face
and
tell
me
what
you
see
what
i
see
repeated
the
doctor
mystified
why
nothing
but
the
same
blundering
old
fellow
that
i
have
always
seen
the
master
laughed
happily
so
and
this
blundering
old
fellow
has
nothing
come
to
him
i
ca
imagine
said
the
doctor
shaking
his
head
i
may
be
dense
but
i
fear
you
will
have
to
tell
me
so
then
listen
long
since
perhaps
you
have
known
of
mine
sorrow
of
it
i
have
never
said
much
because
mine
old
heart
was
sore
and
because
mine
friend
could
understand
without
words
yes
replied
the
doctor
eagerly
i
knew
that
the
one
you
loved
was
taken
away
from
you
while
you
were
both
very
young
yes
well
look
in
mine
face
once
more
and
tell
me
what
you
see
you
you
have
found
her
gasped
the
doctor
quite
beside
himself
with
surprise
precisely
the
master
assured
him
with
his
face
beaming
the
doctor
wrung
his
hand
franz
my
old
friend
he
cried
words
can
not
tell
you
how
glad
i
am
where
who
is
she
mine
friend
returned
the
master
it
is
you
who
are
one
blundering
old
fellow
after
taking
to
yourself
the
errand
of
telling
her
that
i
loved
her
still
you
did
not
see
fit
to
come
back
to
me
with
the
news
that
she
also
cared
thereby
much
time
has
been
wrongly
spent
the
doctor
grew
hot
and
cold
by
turns
you
do
mean
he
cried
not
not
mrs
irving
who
else
asked
the
master
serenely
in
all
the
world
is
she
not
the
most
lovely
lady
who
that
has
seen
her
does
not
love
her
and
why
not
i
doctor
brinkerhoff
sank
into
a
chair
very
much
excited
it
is
one
astonishment
also
to
me
the
master
went
on
i
can
not
believe
that
the
dear
god
has
been
so
good
and
i
must
always
be
pinching
mineself
to
be
sure
that
i
do
not
sleep
it
is
most
wonderful
it
is
indeed
the
doctor
returned
but
see
how
it
has
happened
only
now
can
i
understand
in
the
beginning
mine
heart
is
very
hurt
but
out
of
mine
hurt
there
comes
the
power
to
make
mineself
one
great
artist
it
was
mine
cremona
that
made
the
parting
because
i
am
so
foolish
that
i
must
go
in
her
house
to
look
at
it
it
was
mine
cremona
that
took
her
to
me
the
last
time
when
she
gave
it
to
me
she
says
you
take
this
you
will
not
forget
me
and
it
is
mine
to
do
with
what
i
please
so
when
i
have
made
mineself
the
great
artist
i
have
played
on
mine
cremona
to
many
thousands
and
the
tears
have
come
from
all
see
it
is
always
mine
cremona
and
because
of
this
she
has
heard
of
me
afar
off
and
she
has
chosen
to
have
mine
son
learn
the
violin
from
me
so
that
he
also
shall
be
one
artist
twice
she
has
heard
me
and
mine
cremona
when
we
make
the
music
together
once
in
the
street
outside
mine
house
and
once
when
i
played
the
in
her
house
when
the
old
lady
was
dead
doctor
brinkerhoff
turned
away
his
muscles
suddenly
rigid
but
the
master
talked
on
heedlessly
see
it
is
always
mine
cremona
and
the
dear
god
has
made
us
in
the
same
way
he
has
made
mine
violin
out
of
the
pain
the
cutting
and
the
long
night
and
also
me
so
that
i
shall
be
suited
to
touch
it
it
is
so
that
i
am
to
her
as
mine
cremona
is
to
me
i
am
her
instrument
and
she
can
do
with
me
what
she
will
it
is
but
the
one
string
now
that
needs
the
tuning
went
on
the
master
deeply
troubled
i
know
not
what
to
do
with
mine
fredrika
fredrika
repeated
doctor
brinkerhoff
he
too
had
forgotten
the
faithful
fräulein
the
bright
colours
are
not
for
mine
liebchen
the
master
continued
the
bright
colours
said
the
doctor
by
some
curious
trick
of
mind
immediately
upon
the
defensive
why
i
have
always
thought
them
very
pretty
a
great
light
broke
in
upon
the
master
and
he
could
not
be
expected
to
perceive
that
it
was
only
a
will
o
the
wisp
so
he
cried
triumphantly
you
have
loved
mine
sister
i
have
sometimes
thought
so
and
now
i
know
the
doctor
face
turned
a
dull
red
his
eyelids
drooped
and
he
wiped
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
ah
mine
friend
said
the
master
exultantly
is
it
not
most
wonderful
to
see
how
we
have
played
at
the
all
these
years
you
have
waited
because
you
would
not
take
mine
sister
away
from
me
you
mine
kind
unselfish
friend
so
much
fun
have
you
made
of
mine
housekeeping
before
she
came
that
you
would
not
do
me
this
wrong
and
i
i
could
not
send
mine
sister
the
money
to
take
the
long
journey
and
for
many
years
keep
her
from
her
germany
and
her
friends
then
after
one
night
say
to
her
i
have
found
mine
old
sweetheart
and
i
no
longer
want
you
mine
fredrika
has
never
known
of
mine
sorrow
and
i
can
not
give
her
the
news
it
is
not
for
me
to
make
mine
sister
heart
to
ache
as
mine
has
ached
all
these
years
nor
could
i
give
her
the
money
to
go
back
to
her
germany
because
i
no
longer
want
her
when
she
has
given
it
all
up
for
me
it
would
be
most
unkind
but
now
see
what
the
dear
god
has
done
for
us
when
it
is
all
worked
out
and
we
come
to
the
end
we
see
that
you
also
share
i
know
mine
friend
i
know
what
it
has
been
for
you
because
i
too
have
been
through
the
deep
waters
and
now
we
come
to
the
land
together
it
is
most
fitting
because
we
are
friends
moreover
you
are
to
her
as
she
is
to
you
she
has
not
told
me
but
mine
old
eyes
are
sharp
and
i
see
i
tell
you
this
to
put
the
courage
into
your
heart
if
you
make
mine
sister
happy
it
is
all
i
shall
ask
go
now
to
mine
fredrika
and
tell
her
i
will
not
be
back
until
late
this
evening
is
it
not
most
beautiful
limp
helpless
and
sorely
shaken
but
without
the
faintest
idea
of
protesting
doctor
brinkerhoff
found
himself
started
up
the
hill
the
master
stood
at
the
foot
waving
his
hat
in
boyish
fashion
and
shouting
messages
of
at
last
when
he
dared
to
look
back
the
doctor
saw
that
the
way
was
clear
and
he
sat
down
upon
a
boulder
by
the
roadside
to
think
he
would
be
ungenerous
indeed
he
thought
if
he
could
not
make
some
sacrifice
for
franz
and
for
irving
unwillingly
he
had
come
into
possession
of
fräulein
fredrika
closely
guarded
secret
and
as
he
repeatedly
told
himself
he
was
a
man
of
honour
moreover
he
was
not
one
of
those
restless
spirits
who
forever
question
life
for
its
meaning
clearly
there
was
no
other
way
than
the
one
which
was
plainly
laid
before
him
but
a
few
more
years
remained
to
him
he
reflected
for
he
was
twenty
years
older
than
the
master
still
life
was
very
strange
disloyalty
to
the
dead
was
impossible
for
she
never
knew
and
would
have
scorned
him
if
she
had
known
the
end
of
the
tangled
web
was
in
his
hands
for
three
people
he
could
make
it
straight
again
the
long
shadows
lay
upon
the
hill
and
still
he
sat
there
thinking
the
children
played
about
him
and
asked
meaningless
questions
for
the
first
time
finding
their
friend
unresponsive
finally
one
a
little
bolder
than
the
rest
came
closer
to
him
the
good
fräulein
whispered
the
child
she
is
much
troubled
for
the
master
why
is
it
that
he
comes
not
to
his
home
with
a
sigh
and
a
smile
the
doctor
went
slowly
up
the
hill
to
the
master
house
where
fräulein
fredrika
was
waiting
anxiously
mine
brudder
she
cried
is
he
ill
no
no
fräulein
answered
the
doctor
reassuringly
his
heart
made
tender
by
her
distress
shall
not
franz
sit
in
my
office
to
await
the
infrequent
patient
while
i
take
his
place
with
his
sister
you
are
glad
to
see
me
are
you
not
fräulein
the
tint
of
faded
roses
came
into
the
fräulein
face
mine
friend
she
said
simply
is
always
most
welcome
she
excused
herself
after
a
few
minutes
and
began
to
bustle
about
in
the
kitchen
surely
thought
the
doctor
it
was
pleasant
to
have
a
woman
in
one
house
to
bring
orderly
comfort
into
one
daily
living
the
kettle
sang
cheerily
and
the
fräulein
hummed
a
little
song
under
her
breath
in
the
twilight
the
gay
colours
faded
into
a
subdued
harmony
it
is
all
very
pleasant
said
the
doctor
to
himself
resolutely
putting
aside
a
memory
of
something
quite
different
perhaps
as
his
simple
friends
said
the
dear
god
knew
after
tea
the
fräulein
drew
her
chair
to
the
window
and
looked
out
seemingly
unconscious
of
his
presence
a
rare
woman
he
told
himself
one
who
has
the
gift
of
silence
in
the
dusk
her
face
was
almost
beautiful
all
the
hard
lines
softened
and
made
tenderly
wistful
the
doctor
sighed
and
she
turned
uneasily
mine
brudder
she
said
anxiously
if
something
was
wrong
with
him
you
would
tell
me
yes
of
course
laughed
the
doctor
why
are
you
so
distressed
is
it
so
strange
for
me
to
be
here
no
she
answered
in
a
low
tone
but
you
are
mine
brudder
friend
and
yours
also
fredrika
did
you
never
think
of
that
she
trembled
but
did
not
answer
and
leaning
forward
the
doctor
took
her
hand
in
his
fredrika
he
said
very
gently
you
will
perhaps
think
it
is
strange
for
me
to
talk
in
this
way
but
have
you
never
thought
of
me
as
something
more
than
a
friend
the
woman
was
silent
and
bitterly
ashamed
wondering
when
and
where
she
had
betrayed
herself
that
is
unfair
he
continued
instantly
perceiving
i
have
thought
of
you
in
that
way
more
especially
even
in
the
dusk
he
could
see
the
light
in
her
eyes
and
in
his
turn
he
too
was
shamed
dear
fräulein
fredrika
he
went
on
i
have
not
much
to
offer
but
all
i
have
is
yours
i
am
old
and
the
woman
i
loved
died
never
knowing
that
i
loved
her
if
she
had
known
it
would
have
made
no
difference
perhaps
you
think
it
an
empty
gift
but
it
is
my
all
you
too
may
have
dreamed
of
something
quite
different
but
in
the
end
god
knows
best
fredrika
will
you
come
the
maidenly
heart
within
her
rioted
madly
in
her
breast
but
she
was
used
to
i
thank
you
she
said
with
gentle
dignity
it
is
one
compliment
which
is
very
high
but
i
can
not
leave
mine
franz
all
the
way
from
mine
germany
i
have
come
to
mend
to
cook
to
wash
to
sew
to
scrub
to
sweep
to
take
after
him
the
many
things
which
he
forgets
and
leaves
behind
even
the
most
essential
what
should
he
think
of
me
if
i
should
say
i
will
do
this
for
you
no
more
but
for
someone
else
you
will
understand
she
concluded
in
a
pathetic
little
voice
which
stirred
him
strangely
because
you
are
mine
friend
yes
replied
the
doctor
i
am
his
friend
and
so
do
you
think
i
would
come
without
his
permission
dear
fräulein
franz
knows
and
is
glad
that
is
why
i
left
him
almost
the
last
words
he
said
to
me
were
these
you
make
mine
sister
happy
it
is
all
i
ask
franz
she
cried
mine
dear
unselfish
franz
always
so
good
so
gentle
did
he
say
that
yes
he
said
that
will
you
come
fredrika
shall
we
try
to
make
each
other
happy
she
was
standing
by
the
window
now
with
her
hand
upon
her
heart
and
her
face
alight
with
more
than
earthly
joy
dear
fräulein
said
the
doctor
rejoicing
because
it
was
in
his
power
to
give
any
human
creature
so
much
happiness
will
you
come
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
put
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
and
drew
her
toward
him
then
the
heavens
opened
for
fräulein
fredrika
and
rained
down
upon
her
unbelieving
soul
xxi
the
cremona
speaks
the
grey
autumnal
rain
beat
heavily
upon
her
window
and
iris
stood
watching
it
with
a
heavy
weight
upon
her
heart
the
prospect
was
inexpressibly
dreary
as
far
as
she
could
see
there
was
nothing
but
a
desert
of
roofs
roofs
thought
iris
always
roofs
who
would
think
there
were
so
many
in
the
world
six
months
ago
she
had
been
a
happy
child
but
now
all
was
changed
grown
to
womanhood
through
sorrow
she
could
never
be
the
same
again
even
though
aunt
peace
by
some
miracle
of
resurrection
should
be
given
back
to
her
in
those
long
weeks
of
loneliness
iris
had
learned
a
different
point
of
view
she
had
not
written
to
irving
but
once
though
the
motherly
letter
that
came
in
reply
to
her
note
had
seemed
like
a
brief
glimpse
of
east
lancaster
doctor
brinkerhoff
letter
also
remained
unanswered
chiefly
because
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
write
her
grief
for
aunt
peace
was
insensibly
changed
the
poignant
sense
of
loss
which
belonged
to
the
first
few
weeks
had
become
something
quite
different
gradually
she
had
learned
acceptance
though
not
yet
resignation
with
a
wisdom
far
beyond
her
years
she
had
plunged
into
her
work
the
hours
not
devoted
to
lessons
or
practice
were
spent
at
her
books
she
had
even
planned
out
her
days
by
a
schedule
in
which
every
minute
was
accounted
for
so
much
for
study
so
much
for
practise
so
much
for
the
daily
walk
she
had
no
friends
aside
from
the
proprietor
of
the
she
was
upon
speaking
terms
with
no
one
except
her
teacher
and
one
of
the
attendants
at
the
library
it
has
been
written
that
there
is
no
loneliness
like
that
of
a
great
city
and
in
the
experience
of
nearly
every
one
it
is
at
some
time
proved
true
she
missed
east
lancaster
with
all
its
dear
familiar
ways
the
path
the
maple
at
the
gate
and
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
garden
constantly
flitted
before
her
like
a
mocking
dream
she
could
not
avoid
contrasting
the
tiny
chamber
which
was
now
her
only
home
with
the
great
rooms
of
the
old
house
where
everything
was
always
exquisitely
clean
she
even
longed
for
the
kitchen
with
its
shining
saucepans
and
its
tiled
hearth
to
go
back
if
only
for
one
night
to
her
own
room
to
make
the
little
cakes
for
doctor
brinkerhoff
and
play
her
part
in
the
pretty
wednesday
evening
comedy
while
aunt
peace
sat
by
graciously
hospitable
and
lynn
kept
them
all
laughing
oh
if
she
only
could
but
it
is
the
sadness
of
life
that
there
is
never
any
going
back
the
hour
with
its
opportunity
its
own
individual
beauty
comes
but
once
the
hand
takes
out
of
the
crystal
pool
as
much
water
as
the
tiny
curved
cup
of
the
palm
will
hold
the
shining
drops
each
one
perfect
in
itself
and
changing
colour
with
the
shifting
of
the
light
fall
through
the
fingers
back
into
the
pool
with
a
faint
suggestion
of
music
in
the
sound
the
circle
widens
outward
and
presently
the
water
is
still
again
if
one
could
go
back
gather
from
the
pool
those
same
shining
drops
made
into
jewels
by
the
light
which
at
the
moment
is
also
changing
one
might
go
back
to
the
hour
steadfastly
iris
had
hardened
her
heart
against
lynn
he
had
dared
to
love
her
her
cheeks
crimsoned
with
shame
at
the
thought
but
still
when
the
days
were
dark
it
had
more
than
once
been
a
certain
comfort
to
know
that
someone
cared
aside
from
aunt
peace
asleep
in
the
churchyard
lynn
and
aunt
peace
they
were
the
only
ones
who
cared
irving
had
been
friendly
doctor
brinkerhoff
and
the
master
had
been
kind
fräulein
fredrika
had
always
been
glad
when
she
went
to
see
her
but
these
were
like
bits
of
summer
blown
for
an
instant
against
the
winter
of
the
world
iris
saw
clearly
from
her
new
standpoint
that
she
had
learned
to
love
the
writer
of
the
letters
it
was
he
upon
whom
her
soul
leaned
then
in
the
midst
of
her
grief
to
find
that
her
unknown
lover
was
merely
lynn
a
boy
who
chased
her
around
the
garden
with
grasshoppers
and
worms
it
was
too
much
meditatively
iris
brushed
the
surface
of
her
cheek
where
lynn
had
kissed
her
she
could
feel
it
now
an
awkward
boyish
kiss
it
was
much
the
same
as
if
aunt
peace
or
irving
had
done
it
and
it
was
not
at
all
what
one
read
about
in
the
books
if
it
were
not
for
lynn
she
could
go
back
to
east
lancaster
she
might
go
anyway
if
she
were
sure
she
would
not
meet
him
but
where
could
she
stay
not
with
irving
that
was
certain
unless
lynn
went
away
but
even
then
sometimes
he
would
come
back
she
could
not
always
avoid
him
her
eyes
filled
when
she
thought
of
the
master
generously
offering
her
two
of
his
six
tiny
rooms
the
parlour
with
its
hideous
ornaments
seemed
far
preferable
to
the
dingy
room
in
the
where
the
old
square
piano
stood
thick
with
dust
and
where
iris
did
her
daily
practising
but
no
even
there
she
would
meet
lynn
east
lancaster
was
forbidden
to
her
she
could
never
go
there
again
women
have
a
strange
attachment
for
places
especially
for
those
which
even
for
a
little
time
have
been
home
to
a
man
home
means
merely
a
house
more
or
less
comfortable
according
to
circumstances
where
he
eats
and
sleeps
an
and
a
fire
which
await
him
at
the
close
of
the
day
the
location
of
it
matters
not
to
him
uproot
him
suddenly
transport
him
to
a
strange
land
surround
him
with
new
household
gods
give
him
an
occupation
and
he
will
rather
enjoy
the
change
never
for
an
instant
will
he
grieve
with
assured
comfort
and
congenial
employment
he
will
be
equally
happy
in
new
york
or
on
the
coast
of
south
africa
but
the
woman
ah
the
daily
tragedy
of
the
woman
in
the
strange
place
and
the
long
months
before
she
becomes
even
reconciled
to
her
new
surroundings
after
all
it
is
the
home
instinct
and
the
mother
instinct
which
make
the
foundations
of
civilisation
so
it
was
that
iris
hungered
for
east
lancaster
quite
apart
from
its
people
every
rod
of
the
ground
was
familiar
to
her
from
the
woods
far
to
the
east
to
the
master
house
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
at
the
very
edge
of
west
lancaster
overlooking
the
valley
and
toward
the
blue
hills
beyond
the
rain
dripped
drearily
and
iris
sighed
she
felt
herself
absolutely
alone
in
the
world
with
neither
friend
nor
kindred
there
was
only
one
belonging
to
her
who
was
not
dead
her
father
no
trace
of
him
had
been
found
and
his
death
had
been
taken
for
granted
but
none
the
less
iris
wondered
if
he
might
not
still
live
and
remorseful
if
perhaps
her
skirts
had
not
brushed
against
him
in
some
crowded
thoroughfare
of
the
city
she
hoped
not
for
even
that
seemed
contamination
it
did
not
much
matter
that
in
her
haste
she
had
left
the
box
containing
the
photographs
and
the
papers
in
the
attic
aunt
peace
emerald
the
fan
and
the
lace
which
she
had
also
forgotten
were
rightfully
hers
and
yet
they
seemed
to
belong
to
the
house
to
irving
and
lynn
swiftly
upon
her
thought
came
a
rap
at
her
door
a
letter
for
you
miss
temple
iris
took
it
eagerly
and
closed
the
door
again
consciously
disappointed
when
she
saw
that
it
was
from
irving
doctor
brinkerhoff
careless
remark
to
the
effect
that
lynn
would
write
soon
had
fallen
upon
fertile
soil
first
iris
decided
not
to
read
the
letter
when
it
came
to
return
it
unopened
then
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
be
rude
but
she
need
not
answer
it
next
a
healthy
human
curiosity
as
to
what
lynn
might
have
to
say
to
her
after
all
that
had
passed
between
them
then
she
wondered
whether
lynn
next
letter
would
be
anything
like
the
three
that
she
had
put
away
in
her
trunk
now
her
hands
were
trembling
and
her
cheeks
were
very
pale
my
dear
child
the
letter
began
not
having
heard
from
you
for
so
long
i
fear
that
you
are
ill
or
in
trouble
if
anything
is
wrong
do
not
hesitate
to
tell
us
for
we
are
your
friends
as
always
doctor
brinkerhoff
herr
kaufmann
or
i
would
be
glad
to
do
anything
to
make
you
happier
or
more
comfortable
i
will
come
if
you
say
so
or
either
of
the
other
two
we
are
all
well
and
happy
here
but
we
miss
you
wo
you
come
back
to
us
if
only
for
a
little
while
the
old
house
is
desolate
without
you
and
it
is
your
home
as
much
as
it
is
mine
you
left
the
emerald
and
the
other
little
keepsakes
shall
i
send
them
to
you
or
will
you
come
for
them
in
any
event
please
write
me
a
line
to
tell
me
that
all
is
well
with
you
or
if
not
how
i
can
help
you
very
affectionately
yours
margaret
irving
and
never
a
word
about
lynn
only
that
all
were
well
and
happy
which
of
course
included
lynn
and
went
far
to
prove
to
iris
that
she
was
right
that
he
had
no
heart
it
was
different
in
the
books
when
a
beloved
woman
went
away
the
hero
heart
invariably
broke
and
here
was
lynn
well
and
happy
iris
put
the
letter
aside
with
a
gesture
of
disdain
yet
the
motherly
tone
of
it
had
touched
her
more
deeply
than
she
knew
and
accentuated
her
loneliness
twice
she
tried
to
answer
it
to
tell
irving
that
she
too
was
well
and
happy
and
ask
her
to
send
the
emerald
the
lace
and
the
fan
twice
she
gave
it
up
for
the
page
was
sadly
blotted
with
her
tears
then
she
determined
to
write
the
next
day
and
ask
also
for
the
box
of
papers
in
the
attic
yet
would
she
want
irving
to
see
the
documents
meant
for
her
eyes
alone
and
that
pathetic
little
mother
in
the
tawdry
stage
trappings
surely
not
she
did
not
question
margaret
sense
of
honour
but
there
were
many
boxes
in
the
trunk
in
the
attic
and
she
would
have
to
open
them
one
after
another
until
she
was
sure
she
had
found
the
right
one
sorely
puzzled
desperately
homesick
and
very
lonely
iris
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
all
night
she
dreamed
of
east
lancaster
where
the
sky
came
down
close
to
the
ground
instead
of
ending
at
an
ugly
line
of
roofs
the
soft
winds
came
through
her
window
sweet
with
clover
and
apple
bloom
doctor
brinkerhoff
and
the
master
fräulein
fredrika
aunt
peace
irving
and
lynn
always
lynn
moved
in
and
out
of
the
dream
when
she
woke
she
felt
her
desolation
more
keenly
than
ever
before
at
the
door
of
sleep
a
sentinel
stands
an
angel
in
grey
garments
the
crimson
poppies
crown
her
head
and
droop
to
her
waist
the
floor
is
strewn
with
them
and
the
silken
petals
crushed
by
the
feet
of
passing
strangers
give
out
a
strange
perfume
to
enter
that
door
you
must
pass
our
lady
of
dreams
sometimes
she
smiles
as
you
enter
and
sometimes
there
is
only
a
careless
nod
often
her
clear
serene
eyes
make
no
sign
of
recognition
and
at
other
times
she
frowns
but
whatever
be
the
temper
of
the
lady
at
the
door
your
dream
waits
for
you
inside
the
parcels
are
all
alike
so
it
is
useless
to
stop
and
choose
but
you
must
take
one
frequently
when
you
open
it
there
is
nothing
there
but
peaceful
slumber
cunningly
arranged
to
look
like
a
dream
once
in
a
thousand
times
it
happens
that
you
get
the
dream
that
is
meant
for
you
because
it
all
depends
upon
chance
and
so
many
strangers
nightly
enter
that
door
that
it
is
impossible
to
arrange
the
parcels
any
differently
when
the
night
has
passed
and
you
come
back
it
is
always
through
the
same
door
where
the
patient
sentinel
still
stands
you
are
supposed
to
give
back
your
dream
so
that
someone
else
may
have
it
the
next
night
but
if
she
is
tired
or
very
busy
you
may
sometimes
slip
through
and
so
have
a
dream
to
remember
iris
had
given
back
her
dream
but
a
strong
impression
of
east
lancaster
still
remained
and
it
was
as
though
she
had
been
there
in
the
night
suddenly
she
sat
up
in
bed
with
her
heart
wildly
throbbing
why
not
go
back
why
not
indeed
why
not
take
a
flying
trip
just
to
see
the
dear
place
again
why
not
talk
for
a
few
minutes
with
irving
then
slip
upstairs
for
the
emerald
the
bit
of
lace
the
feather
fan
and
the
lonely
little
mother
in
the
attic
she
could
plan
her
journey
so
that
she
would
be
making
her
call
while
lynn
was
at
his
lesson
when
it
was
time
for
him
to
return
she
could
go
to
doctor
brinkerhoff
and
thank
him
for
writing
while
there
she
could
see
lynn
come
downhill
of
course
not
to
look
at
him
but
just
to
know
that
he
was
out
of
the
way
then
she
could
go
up
the
hill
and
stay
with
fräulein
fredrika
and
the
master
until
almost
train
time
it
was
practicable
and
in
every
way
desirable
perhaps
after
she
had
seen
east
lancaster
once
more
she
would
not
be
so
homesick
iris
hummed
a
little
song
as
she
dressed
herself
far
happier
than
she
had
been
for
many
months
thought
and
action
were
never
far
apart
with
her
the
next
day
she
was
safely
aboard
the
train
she
stopped
overnight
at
the
little
hotel
in
a
nearby
town
where
once
she
had
been
with
aunt
peace
after
a
memorable
visit
to
the
city
the
morning
train
left
at
five
and
just
at
ten
she
reached
her
destination
her
heart
fluttering
joyously
lynn
was
certainly
at
his
lesson
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
that
she
fairly
flew
up
the
street
fearful
lest
someone
should
see
her
and
paused
at
the
corner
for
a
look
at
the
old
house
nothing
was
changed
it
was
just
as
it
had
been
for
two
centuries
and
more
panic
seized
her
but
she
went
on
boldly
though
her
cheeks
burned
after
all
she
was
not
an
intruder
it
was
her
home
not
only
through
the
gift
but
by
right
of
possession
she
rang
the
bell
timidly
but
no
one
answered
then
she
tried
again
but
with
no
better
result
so
she
turned
the
knob
and
the
door
opened
she
stepped
in
but
no
one
was
there
mrs
irving
she
called
but
only
the
echo
of
her
own
voice
came
back
to
her
the
portraits
in
the
hall
stared
at
her
but
it
was
a
friendly
scrutiny
and
not
at
all
distressing
they
seemed
to
nod
to
one
another
and
to
whisper
from
their
gilded
frames
iris
has
come
back
well
she
thought
i
ca
sit
down
and
wait
for
lynn
may
come
home
from
his
lesson
at
any
minute
i
just
go
upstairs
the
door
of
margaret
room
was
ajar
and
iris
peeped
in
but
it
was
empty
like
the
rest
of
the
house
she
stole
into
aunt
peace
room
found
her
keepsakes
and
prepared
to
depart
she
saw
her
reflection
in
the
long
mirror
and
for
the
moment
it
startled
her
i
feel
like
a
thief
she
said
to
herself
even
though
i
am
only
taking
my
own
she
went
up
into
the
attic
found
the
box
and
came
down
again
the
old
house
was
so
still
surely
it
would
do
no
harm
if
she
took
just
one
sniff
at
the
cedar
chest
before
she
went
away
she
loved
the
fragrance
of
the
wood
and
it
would
delay
her
only
a
moment
longer
then
all
at
once
she
paused
like
a
frightened
bird
someone
was
there
someone
was
walking
back
and
forth
in
lynn
room
scarcely
knowing
what
she
did
iris
crouched
on
the
floor
at
the
end
of
the
chest
trusting
to
the
kindly
shadows
to
screen
her
if
the
door
should
open
but
no
one
came
lynn
had
taken
the
cremona
from
its
case
with
something
very
like
a
smile
upon
his
face
the
brown
breasts
had
the
colour
of
old
wine
and
the
shell
was
thin
to
the
point
of
fragility
he
had
feared
to
touch
it
but
the
master
had
only
laughed
at
him
what
he
had
said
shall
i
not
sometimes
lend
mine
cremona
to
mine
son
who
like
mineself
is
one
great
artist
of
a
surety
lynn
placed
the
instrument
in
position
and
dreamily
began
to
play
his
mother
was
out
and
he
played
as
he
could
not
if
he
had
not
thought
himself
alone
all
his
heartbreak
all
his
pain
the
white
nights
and
the
dark
days
went
into
the
adagio
the
one
thing
suited
to
his
mood
at
the
first
notes
iris
drew
a
quick
gasping
breath
surely
it
was
not
lynn
yet
who
else
should
be
in
his
room
playing
as
no
one
played
but
the
great
primeval
forces
held
her
in
their
grasp
and
all
at
once
her
shallowness
fell
away
from
her
leaving
her
free
the
blood
surged
into
her
heart
with
shame
she
had
wronged
lynn
she
had
been
so
blind
so
painfully
sure
of
herself
so
pitifully
important
in
her
the
music
went
on
without
hindrance
or
pause
deep
chords
and
piercing
flights
of
melody
alternated
through
the
theme
yet
there
was
the
undertone
of
love
and
night
and
death
iris
clenched
her
hands
until
the
nails
cut
into
her
palms
all
her
life
she
seemed
to
have
been
playing
with
tinsel
now
when
it
was
out
of
her
reach
she
had
discovered
the
gold
why
should
it
seem
so
strange
for
lynn
to
play
like
this
had
he
not
written
the
letters
had
he
not
offered
her
his
whole
heart
the
gift
she
had
so
insultingly
thrown
aside
iris
knelt
beside
the
chest
in
bitter
humiliation
one
thing
was
certain
she
must
go
away
and
quickly
she
could
not
wait
there
trembling
and
afraid
until
someone
found
her
she
must
get
away
but
how
she
was
sorely
shaken
both
in
body
and
soul
she
could
not
go
away
and
yet
she
must
she
would
go
to
the
station
and
from
there
write
to
irving
and
to
lynn
the
least
she
could
do
was
to
ask
him
to
forgive
her
having
done
that
she
would
go
back
to
the
city
change
her
address
and
be
lost
to
them
forever
low
quivering
tones
came
from
the
cremona
like
the
sobs
of
a
woman
whose
heart
was
broken
suddenly
iris
knew
that
she
belonged
to
lynn
that
through
love
or
hate
she
was
bound
to
him
forever
then
in
a
blinding
flood
came
the
tears
slowly
the
adagio
swept
to
its
end
and
yet
she
could
not
move
the
music
ceased
and
yet
the
silence
held
her
spellbound
vainly
praying
for
the
strength
to
go
away
she
heard
the
click
of
the
lock
as
the
violin
case
was
closed
the
quick
step
to
the
door
and
the
turning
of
the
knob
she
shrank
back
into
the
corner
close
to
the
chest
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
then
someone
lifted
her
up
sweetheart
cried
lynn
have
you
come
back
to
me
at
the
touch
at
the
tender
word
the
barriers
crumbled
away
and
iris
lifted
her
lovely
face
to
his
yes
she
said
unsteadily
i
have
come
back
will
you
forgive
me
forgive
you
repeated
lynn
with
a
happy
laugh
why
dearest
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
in
that
radiant
instant
he
thought
he
spoke
the
truth
so
quickly
do
we
forget
sorrow
when
the
sun
shines
into
the
soul
oh
sobbed
iris
hiding
her
face
against
his
shoulder
i
i
said
you
had
no
heart
so
i
have
darling
answered
lynn
tenderly
i
gave
it
all
to
you
the
very
first
day
i
saw
you
will
you
keep
it
for
me
dear
will
you
give
me
a
little
corner
of
your
own
all
whispered
iris
i
think
it
has
always
been
yours
but
i
know
until
just
now
how
long
have
you
been
here
sweetheart
i
i
do
know
i
heard
you
play
and
then
i
knew
it
was
that
blessed
cremona
said
lynn
with
his
lips
against
her
hair
you
said
i
should
never
kiss
you
again
dear
do
you
remember
do
you
think
it
time
you
changed
your
mind
the
golden
minutes
slipped
by
and
still
they
stood
there
by
the
window
in
the
hall
margaret
came
back
and
went
up
to
her
room
but
no
one
heard
her
even
though
she
was
singing
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
she
stopped
startled
then
by
the
light
of
her
own
happiness
she
understood
and
crept
softly
away
