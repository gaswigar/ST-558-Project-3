preface
henri
louis
bergson
was
born
in
paris
october
he
entered
the
école
normale
in
and
was
admitted
agrégé
de
philosophie
in
and
docteur
ès
lettres
in
after
holding
professorships
in
various
provincial
and
parisian
lycées
he
became
maître
de
conférences
at
the
école
normale
supérieure
in
and
since
has
been
professor
at
the
collège
de
france
in
he
became
a
member
of
the
institute
on
his
election
to
the
académie
des
sciences
morales
et
politiques
a
full
list
of
professor
bergson
works
is
given
in
the
appended
bibliography
in
making
the
following
translation
of
his
sur
les
données
immédiates
de
la
i
have
had
the
great
advantage
of
his
at
every
stage
and
the
aid
which
he
has
given
has
been
most
generous
and
untiring
the
book
itself
was
worked
out
and
written
during
the
years
to
and
was
originally
published
in
the
in
the
french
edition
contain
a
certain
number
of
references
to
french
translations
of
english
works
in
the
present
translation
i
am
responsible
for
citing
these
references
from
the
original
english
this
will
account
for
the
fact
that
editions
are
sometimes
referred
to
which
have
appeared
subsequently
to
i
have
also
added
fairly
extensive
marginal
summaries
and
a
full
index
in
france
the
is
already
in
its
seventh
edition
indeed
one
of
the
most
striking
facts
about
professor
bergson
works
is
the
extent
to
which
they
have
appealed
not
only
to
the
professional
philosophers
but
also
to
the
ordinary
cultivated
public
the
method
which
he
pursues
is
not
the
conceptual
and
abstract
method
which
has
been
the
dominant
tradition
in
philosophy
for
him
reality
is
not
to
be
reached
by
any
elaborate
construction
of
thought
it
is
given
in
immediate
experience
as
a
flux
a
continuous
process
of
becoming
to
be
grasped
by
intuition
by
sympathetic
insight
concepts
break
up
the
continuous
flow
of
reality
into
parts
external
to
one
another
they
further
the
interests
of
language
and
social
life
and
are
useful
primarily
for
practical
purposes
but
they
give
us
nothing
of
the
life
and
movement
of
reality
rather
by
substituting
for
this
an
artificial
reconstruction
a
patchwork
of
dead
fragments
they
lead
to
the
difficulties
which
have
always
beset
the
intellectualist
philosophy
and
which
on
its
premises
are
insoluble
instead
of
attempting
a
solution
in
the
intellectualist
sense
professor
bergson
calls
upon
his
readers
to
put
these
broken
fragments
of
reality
behind
them
to
immerse
themselves
in
the
living
stream
of
things
and
to
find
their
difficulties
swept
away
in
its
resistless
flow
in
the
present
volume
professor
bergson
first
deals
with
the
intensity
of
conscious
states
he
shows
that
quantitative
differences
are
applicable
only
to
magnitudes
that
is
in
the
last
resort
to
space
and
that
intensity
in
itself
is
purely
qualitative
passing
then
from
the
consideration
of
separate
conscious
states
to
their
multiplicity
he
finds
that
there
are
two
forms
of
multiplicity
quantitative
or
discrete
multiplicity
involves
the
intuition
of
space
but
the
multiplicity
of
conscious
states
is
wholly
qualitative
this
unfolding
multiplicity
constitutes
duration
which
is
a
succession
without
distinction
an
interpenetration
of
elements
so
heterogeneous
that
former
states
can
never
recur
the
idea
of
a
homogeneous
and
measurable
time
is
shown
to
be
an
artificial
concept
formed
by
the
intrusion
of
the
idea
of
space
into
the
realm
of
pure
duration
indeed
the
whole
of
professor
bergson
philosophy
centres
round
his
conception
of
concrete
and
the
specific
of
duration
which
our
consciousness
has
when
it
does
away
with
convention
and
habit
and
gets
back
to
its
natural
attitude
at
the
root
of
most
errors
in
philosophy
he
finds
a
confusion
between
this
and
the
which
mathematics
physics
and
even
language
and
common
sense
substitute
for
it
applying
these
results
to
the
problem
of
free
will
he
shows
that
the
difficulties
arise
from
taking
up
stand
the
act
has
been
performed
and
applying
the
conceptual
method
to
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
living
developing
self
these
difficulties
are
shown
to
be
illusory
and
freedom
though
not
definable
in
abstract
or
conceptual
terms
is
declared
to
be
one
of
the
clearest
facts
established
by
observation
it
is
no
doubt
misleading
to
attempt
to
sum
up
a
system
of
philosophy
in
a
sentence
but
perhaps
some
part
of
the
spirit
of
professor
bergson
philosophy
may
be
gathered
from
the
motto
which
with
his
permission
i
have
prefixed
to
this
translation
if
a
man
were
to
inquire
of
nature
the
reason
of
her
creative
activity
and
if
she
were
willing
to
give
ear
and
answer
she
would
say
me
not
but
understand
in
silence
even
as
i
am
silent
and
am
not
wont
to
speak

preface
we
necessarily
express
ourselves
by
means
of
words
and
we
usually
think
in
terms
of
space
that
is
to
say
language
requires
us
to
establish
between
our
ideas
the
same
sharp
and
precise
distinctions
the
same
discontinuity
as
between
material
objects
this
assimilation
of
thought
to
things
is
useful
in
practical
life
and
necessary
in
most
of
the
sciences
but
it
may
be
asked
whether
the
insurmountable
difficulties
presented
by
certain
philosophical
problems
do
not
arise
from
our
placing
side
by
side
in
space
phenomena
which
do
not
occupy
space
and
whether
by
merely
getting
rid
of
the
clumsy
symbols
round
which
we
are
fighting
we
might
not
bring
the
fight
to
an
end
when
an
illegitimate
translation
of
the
unextended
into
the
extended
of
quality
into
quantity
has
introduced
contradiction
into
the
very
heart
of
the
question
contradiction
must
of
course
recur
in
the
answer
the
problem
which
i
have
chosen
is
one
which
is
common
to
metaphysics
and
psychology
the
problem
of
free
will
what
i
attempt
to
prove
is
that
all
discussion
between
the
determinists
and
their
opponents
implies
a
previous
confusion
of
duration
with
extensity
of
succession
with
simultaneity
of
quality
with
quantity
this
confusion
once
dispelled
we
may
perhaps
witness
the
disappearance
of
the
objections
raised
against
free
will
of
the
definitions
given
of
it
and
in
a
certain
sense

the

the
intensity
of
psychic
states
sidenote
can
there
be
quantitative
differences
in
conscious
states
it
is
usually
admitted
that
states
of
consciousness
sensations
feelings
passions
efforts
are
capable
of
growth
and
diminution
we
are
even
told
that
a
sensation
can
be
said
to
be
twice
thrice
four
times
as
intense
as
another
sensation
of
the
same
kind
this
latter
thesis
which
is
maintained
by
psychophysicists
we
shall
examine
later
but
even
the
opponents
of
psychophysics
do
not
see
any
harm
in
speaking
of
one
sensation
as
being
more
intense
than
another
of
one
effort
as
being
greater
than
another
and
in
thus
setting
up
differences
of
quantity
between
purely
internal
states
common
sense
moreover
has
not
the
slightest
hesitation
in
giving
its
verdict
on
this
point
people
say
they
are
more
or
less
warm
or
more
or
less
sad
and
this
distinction
of
more
and
less
even
when
it
is
carried
over
to
the
region
of
subjective
facts
and
unextended
objects
surprises
nobody
but
this
involves
a
very
obscure
point
and
a
much
more
important
problem
than
is
usually
supposed
when
we
assert
that
one
number
is
greater
than
another
number
or
one
body
greater
than
another
body
we
know
very
well
what
we
mean
sidenote
such
differences
applicable
to
magnitudes
but
not
to
intensities
for
in
both
cases
we
allude
to
unequal
spaces
as
shall
be
shown
in
detail
a
little
further
on
and
we
call
that
space
the
greater
which
contains
the
other
but
how
can
a
more
intense
sensation
contain
one
of
less
intensity
shall
we
say
that
the
first
implies
the
second
that
we
reach
the
sensation
of
higher
intensity
only
on
condition
of
having
first
passed
through
the
less
intense
stages
of
the
same
sensation
and
that
in
a
certain
sense
we
are
concerned
here
also
with
the
relation
of
container
to
contained
this
conception
of
intensive
magnitude
seems
indeed
to
be
that
of
common
sense
but
we
can
not
advance
it
as
a
philosophical
explanation
without
becoming
involved
in
a
vicious
circle
for
it
is
beyond
doubt
that
in
the
natural
series
of
numbers
the
later
number
exceeds
the
earlier
but
the
very
possibility
of
arranging
the
numbers
in
ascending
order
arises
from
their
having
to
each
other
relations
of
container
and
contained
so
that
we
feel
ourselves
able
to
explain
precisely
in
what
sense
one
is
greater
than
the
other
the
question
then
is
how
we
succeed
in
forming
a
series
of
this
kind
with
intensities
which
can
not
be
superposed
on
each
other
and
by
what
sign
we
recognize
that
the
members
of
this
series
increase
for
example
instead
of
diminishing
but
this
always
comes
back
to
the
inquiry
why
an
intensity
can
be
assimilated
to
a
magnitude
sidenote
alleged
distinction
between
two
kinds
of
quantity
extensive
and
intensive
magnitude
it
is
only
to
evade
the
difficulty
to
distinguish
as
is
usually
done
between
two
species
of
quantity
the
first
extensive
and
measurable
the
second
intensive
and
not
admitting
of
measure
but
of
which
it
can
nevertheless
be
said
that
it
is
greater
or
less
than
another
intensity
for
it
is
recognized
thereby
that
there
is
something
common
to
these
two
forms
of
magnitude
since
they
are
both
termed
magnitudes
and
declared
to
be
equally
capable
of
increase
and
diminution
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
magnitude
what
can
there
be
in
common
between
the
extensive
and
the
intensive
the
extended
and
the
unextended
if
in
the
first
case
we
call
that
which
contains
the
other
the
greater
quantity
why
go
on
speaking
of
quantity
and
magnitude
when
there
is
no
longer
a
container
or
a
contained
if
a
quantity
can
increase
and
diminish
if
we
perceive
in
it
so
to
speak
the
inside
the
is
not
such
a
quantity
on
this
very
account
divisible
and
thereby
extended
is
it
not
then
a
contradiction
to
speak
of
an
inextensive
quantity
but
yet
common
sense
agrees
with
the
philosophers
in
setting
up
a
pure
intensity
as
a
magnitude
just
as
if
it
were
something
extended
and
not
only
do
we
use
the
same
word
but
whether
we
think
of
a
greater
intensity
or
a
greater
extensity
we
experience
in
both
cases
an
analogous
impression
the
terms
greater
and
less
call
up
in
both
cases
the
same
idea
if
we
now
ask
ourselves
in
what
does
this
idea
consist
our
consciousness
still
offers
us
the
image
of
a
container
and
a
contained
we
picture
to
ourselves
for
example
a
greater
intensity
of
effort
as
a
greater
length
of
thread
rolled
up
or
as
a
spring
which
in
unwinding
will
occupy
a
greater
space
in
the
idea
of
intensity
and
even
in
the
word
which
expresses
it
we
shall
find
the
image
of
a
present
contraction
and
consequently
a
future
expansion
the
image
of
something
virtually
extended
and
if
we
may
say
so
of
a
compressed
space
we
are
thus
led
to
believe
that
we
translate
the
intensive
into
the
extensive
and
that
we
compare
two
intensities
or
at
least
express
the
comparison
by
the
confused
intuition
of
a
relation
between
two
extensities
but
it
is
just
the
nature
of
this
operation
which
it
is
difficult
to
determine
sidenote
attempt
to
distinguish
intensities
by
objective
causes
but
we
judge
of
intensity
without
knowing
magnitude
or
nature
of
the
cause
the
solution
which
occurs
immediately
to
the
mind
once
it
has
entered
upon
this
path
consists
in
defining
the
intensity
of
a
sensation
or
of
any
state
whatever
of
the
ego
by
the
number
and
magnitude
of
the
objective
and
therefore
measurable
causes
which
have
given
rise
to
it
doubtless
a
more
intense
sensation
of
light
is
the
one
which
has
been
obtained
or
is
obtainable
by
means
of
a
larger
number
of
luminous
sources
provided
they
be
at
the
same
distance
and
identical
with
one
another
but
in
the
immense
majority
of
cases
we
decide
about
the
intensity
of
the
effect
without
even
knowing
the
nature
of
the
cause
much
less
its
magnitude
indeed
it
is
the
very
intensity
of
the
effect
which
often
leads
us
to
venture
an
hypothesis
as
to
the
number
and
nature
of
the
causes
and
thus
to
revise
the
judgment
of
our
senses
which
at
first
represented
them
as
insignificant
and
it
is
no
use
arguing
that
we
are
then
comparing
the
actual
state
of
the
ego
with
some
previous
state
in
which
the
cause
was
perceived
in
its
entirety
at
the
same
time
as
its
effect
was
experienced
no
doubt
this
is
our
procedure
in
a
fairly
large
number
of
cases
but
we
can
not
then
explain
the
differences
of
intensity
which
we
recognize
between
psychic
phenomena
the
cause
of
which
is
within
us
and
not
outside
on
the
other
hand
we
are
never
so
bold
in
judging
the
intensity
of
a
psychic
state
as
when
the
subjective
aspect
of
the
phenomenon
is
the
only
one
to
strike
us
or
when
the
external
cause
to
which
we
refer
it
does
not
easily
admit
of
measurement
thus
it
seems
evident
that
we
experience
a
more
intense
pain
at
the
pulling
out
of
a
tooth
than
of
a
hair
the
artist
knows
without
the
possibility
of
doubt
that
the
picture
of
a
master
affords
him
more
intense
pleasure
than
the
signboard
of
a
shop
and
there
is
not
the
slightest
need
ever
to
have
heard
of
forces
of
cohesion
to
assert
that
we
expend
less
effort
in
bending
a
steel
blade
than
a
bar
of
iron
thus
the
comparison
of
two
intensities
is
usually
made
without
the
least
appreciation
of
the
number
of
causes
their
mode
of
action
or
their
extent
sidenote
attempt
to
distinguish
intensities
by
atomic
movements
but
it
is
the
sensation
which
is
given
in
consciousness
and
not
the
movement
there
is
still
room
it
is
true
for
an
hypothesis
of
the
same
nature
but
more
subtle
we
know
that
mechanical
and
especially
kinetic
theories
aim
at
explaining
the
visible
and
sensible
properties
of
bodies
by
defined
movements
of
their
ultimate
parts
and
many
of
us
foresee
the
time
when
the
intensive
differences
of
qualities
that
is
to
say
of
our
sensations
will
be
reduced
to
extensive
differences
between
the
changes
taking
place
behind
them
may
it
not
be
maintained
that
without
knowing
these
theories
we
have
a
vague
surmise
of
them
that
behind
the
more
intense
sound
we
guess
the
presence
of
ampler
vibrations
which
are
propagated
in
the
disturbed
medium
and
that
it
is
with
a
reference
to
this
mathematical
relation
precise
in
itself
though
confusedly
perceived
that
we
assert
the
higher
intensity
of
a
particular
sound
without
even
going
so
far
could
it
not
be
laid
down
that
every
state
of
consciousness
corresponds
to
a
certain
disturbance
of
the
molecules
and
atoms
of
the
cerebral
substance
and
that
the
intensity
of
a
sensation
measures
the
amplitude
the
complication
or
the
extent
of
these
molecular
movements
this
last
hypothesis
is
at
least
as
probable
as
the
other
but
it
no
more
solves
the
problem
for
quite
possibly
the
intensity
of
a
sensation
bears
witness
to
a
more
or
less
considerable
work
accomplished
in
our
organism
but
it
is
the
sensation
which
is
given
to
us
in
consciousness
and
not
this
mechanical
work
indeed
it
is
by
the
intensity
of
the
sensation
that
we
judge
of
the
greater
or
less
amount
of
work
accomplished
intensity
then
remains
at
least
apparently
a
property
of
sensation
and
still
the
same
question
recurs
why
do
we
say
of
a
higher
intensity
that
it
is
greater
why
do
we
think
of
a
greater
quantity
or
a
greater
space
sidenote
different
kinds
of
intensities
psychic
statese
muscular
effort
intensity
is
more
easily
definable
in
the
former
case
perhaps
the
difficulty
of
the
problem
lies
chiefly
in
the
fact
that
we
call
by
the
same
name
and
picture
to
ourselves
in
the
same
way
intensities
which
are
very
different
in
nature
the
intensity
of
a
feeling
and
that
of
a
sensation
or
an
effort
the
effort
is
accompanied
by
a
muscular
sensation
and
the
sensations
themselves
are
connected
with
certain
physical
conditions
which
probably
count
for
something
in
the
estimate
of
their
intensity
we
have
here
to
do
with
phenomena
which
take
place
on
the
surface
of
consciousness
and
which
are
always
connected
as
we
shall
see
further
on
with
the
perception
of
a
movement
or
of
an
external
object
but
certain
states
of
the
soul
seem
to
us
rightly
or
wrongly
to
be
such
as
deep
joy
or
sorrow
a
reflective
passion
or
an
aesthetic
emotion
pure
intensity
ought
to
be
more
easily
definable
in
these
simple
cases
where
no
extensive
element
seems
to
be
involved
we
shall
see
in
fact
that
it
is
reducible
here
to
a
certain
quality
or
shade
which
spreads
over
a
more
or
less
considerable
mass
of
psychic
states
or
if
the
expression
be
preferred
to
the
larger
or
smaller
number
of
simple
states
which
make
up
the
fundamental
emotion
sidenote
take
for
example
the
progress
of
a
desire
for
example
an
obscure
desire
gradually
becomes
a
deep
passion
now
you
will
see
that
thee
feeble
intensity
of
this
desire
consisted
at
first
in
its
appearing
to
be
isolated
and
as
it
were
foreign
to
the
remainder
of
your
inner
life
but
little
by
little
it
permeates
a
larger
number
of
psychic
elements
tingeing
them
so
to
speak
with
its
own
colour
and
lo
your
outlook
on
the
whole
of
your
surroundings
seems
now
to
have
changed
radically
how
do
you
become
aware
of
a
deep
passion
once
it
has
taken
hold
of
you
if
not
by
perceiving
that
the
same
objects
no
longer
impress
you
in
the
same
manner
all
your
sensations
and
all
your
ideas
seem
to
brighten
up
it
is
like
childhood
back
again
we
experience
something
of
the
kind
in
certain
dreams
in
which
we
do
not
imagine
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
and
yet
through
which
there
resounds
an
indescribable
note
of
originality
the
fact
is
that
the
further
we
penetrate
into
the
depths
of
consciousness
the
less
right
we
have
to
treat
psychic
phenomena
as
things
which
are
set
side
by
side
when
it
is
said
that
an
object
occupies
a
large
space
in
the
soul
or
even
that
it
fills
it
entirely
we
ought
to
understand
by
this
simply
that
its
image
has
altered
the
shade
of
a
thousand
perceptions
or
memories
and
that
in
this
sense
it
pervades
them
although
it
does
not
itself
come
into
view
but
this
wholly
dynamic
way
of
looking
at
things
is
repugnant
to
the
reflective
consciousness
because
the
latter
delights
in
clean
cut
distinctions
which
are
easily
expressed
in
words
and
in
things
with
outlines
like
those
which
are
perceived
in
space
it
will
assume
then
that
everything
else
remaining
identical
such
and
such
a
desire
has
gone
up
a
scale
of
magnitudes
as
though
it
were
permissible
still
to
speak
of
magnitude
where
there
is
neither
multiplicity
nor
space
but
just
as
consciousness
as
will
be
shown
later
on
concentrates
on
a
given
point
of
the
organism
the
increasing
number
of
muscular
contractions
which
take
place
on
the
surface
of
the
body
thus
converting
them
into
one
single
feeling
of
effort
of
growing
intensity
so
it
will
hypostatize
under
the
form
of
a
growing
desire
the
gradual
alterations
which
take
place
in
the
confused
heap
of
psychic
states
but
that
is
a
change
of
quality
rather
than
of
magnitude
what
makes
hope
such
an
intense
pleasure
is
the
fact
that
the
future
which
we
dispose
of
to
our
liking
appears
to
us
at
the
same
time
under
a
multitude
of
forms
equally
attractive
and
equally
possible
even
if
the
most
coveted
of
these
becomes
realized
it
will
be
necessary
to
give
up
the
others
and
we
shall
have
lost
a
great
deal
the
idea
of
the
future
pregnant
with
an
infinity
of
possibilities
is
thus
more
fruitful
than
the
future
itself
and
this
is
why
we
find
more
charm
in
hope
than
in
possession
in
dreams
than
in
reality
sidenote
the
emotions
of
joy
and
sorrow
their
successive
stages
correspond
to
qualitative
changes
in
the
whole
of
our
psychic
states
let
us
try
to
discover
the
nature
of
an
increasing
intensity
of
joy
or
sorrow
in
the
exceptional
cases
where
no
physical
symptom
intervenes
neither
inner
joy
nor
passion
is
an
isolated
inner
state
which
at
first
occupies
a
corner
of
the
soul
and
gradually
spreads
at
its
lowest
level
it
is
very
like
a
turning
of
our
states
of
consciousness
towards
the
future
then
as
if
their
weight
were
diminished
by
this
attraction
our
ideas
and
sensations
succeed
one
another
with
greater
rapidity
our
movements
no
longer
cost
us
the
same
effort
finally
in
cases
of
extreme
joy
our
perceptions
and
memories
become
tinged
with
an
indefinable
quality
as
with
a
kind
of
heat
or
light
so
novel
that
now
and
then
as
we
stare
at
our
own
self
we
wonder
how
it
can
really
exist
thus
there
are
several
characteristic
forms
of
purely
inward
joy
all
of
which
are
successive
stages
corresponding
to
qualitative
alterations
in
the
whole
of
our
psychic
states
but
the
number
of
states
which
are
concerned
with
each
of
these
alterations
is
more
or
less
considerable
and
without
explicitly
counting
them
we
know
very
well
whether
for
example
our
joy
pervades
all
the
impressions
which
we
receive
in
the
course
of
the
day
or
whether
any
escape
from
its
influence
we
thus
set
up
points
of
division
in
the
interval
which
separates
two
successive
forms
of
joy
and
this
gradual
transition
from
one
to
the
other
makes
them
appear
in
their
turn
as
different
intensities
of
one
and
the
same
feeling
which
is
thus
supposed
to
change
in
magnitude
it
could
be
easily
shown
that
the
different
degrees
of
sorrow
also
correspond
to
qualitative
changes
sorrow
begins
by
being
nothing
more
than
a
facing
towards
the
past
an
impoverishment
of
our
sensations
and
ideas
as
if
each
of
them
were
now
contained
entirely
in
the
little
which
it
gives
out
as
if
the
future
were
in
some
way
stopped
up
and
it
ends
with
an
impression
of
crushing
failure
the
effect
of
which
is
that
we
aspire
to
nothingness
while
every
new
misfortune
by
making
us
understand
better
the
uselessness
of
the
struggle
causes
us
a
bitter
pleasure
sidenote
the
aesthetic
feelings
their
increasing
intensities
are
really
different
feelings
the
aesthetic
feelings
offer
us
a
still
more
striking
example
of
this
progressive
stepping
in
of
new
elements
which
can
be
detected
in
the
fundamental
emotion
and
which
seem
to
increase
its
magnitude
although
in
reality
they
do
nothing
more
than
alter
its
nature
let
us
consider
the
simplest
of
them
the
feeling
of
grace
at
first
it
is
only
the
perception
of
a
certain
ease
a
certain
facility
in
the
outward
movements
and
as
those
movements
are
easy
which
prepare
the
way
for
others
we
are
led
to
find
a
superior
ease
in
the
movements
which
can
be
foreseen
in
the
present
attitudes
in
which
future
attitudes
are
pointed
out
and
as
it
were
prefigured
if
jerky
movements
are
wanting
in
grace
the
reason
is
that
each
of
them
is
and
does
not
announce
those
which
are
to
follow
if
curves
are
more
graceful
than
broken
lines
the
reason
is
that
while
a
curved
line
changes
its
direction
at
every
moment
every
new
direction
is
indicated
in
the
preceding
one
thus
the
perception
of
ease
in
motion
passes
over
into
the
pleasure
of
mastering
the
flow
of
time
and
of
holding
the
future
in
the
present
a
third
element
comes
in
when
the
graceful
movements
submit
to
a
rhythm
and
are
accompanied
by
music
for
the
rhythm
and
measure
by
allowing
us
to
foresee
to
a
still
greater
extent
the
movements
of
the
dancer
make
us
believe
that
we
now
control
them
as
we
guess
almost
the
exact
attitude
which
the
dancer
is
going
to
take
he
seems
to
obey
us
when
he
really
takes
it
the
regularity
of
the
rhythm
establishes
a
kind
of
communication
between
him
and
us
and
the
periodic
returns
of
the
measure
are
like
so
many
invisible
threads
by
means
of
which
we
set
in
motion
this
imaginary
puppet
indeed
if
it
stops
for
an
instant
our
hand
in
its
impatience
can
not
refrain
from
making
a
movement
as
though
to
push
it
as
though
to
replace
it
in
the
midst
of
this
movement
the
rhythm
of
which
has
taken
complete
possession
of
our
thought
and
will
thus
a
kind
of
physical
sympathy
enters
into
the
feeling
of
grace
now
in
analysing
the
charm
of
this
sympathy
you
will
find
that
it
pleases
you
through
its
affinity
with
moral
sympathy
the
idea
of
which
it
subtly
suggests
this
last
element
in
which
the
others
are
merged
after
having
in
a
measure
ushered
it
in
explains
the
irresistible
attractiveness
of
grace
we
could
hardly
make
out
why
it
affords
us
such
pleasure
if
it
were
nothing
but
a
saving
of
effort
as
spencer
maintains
but
the
truth
is
that
in
anything
which
we
call
very
graceful
we
imagine
ourselves
able
to
detect
besides
the
lightness
which
is
a
sign
of
mobility
some
suggestion
of
a
possible
movement
towards
ourselves
of
a
virtual
and
even
nascent
sympathy
it
is
this
mobile
sympathy
always
ready
to
offer
itself
which
is
just
the
essence
of
higher
grace
thus
the
increasing
intensities
of
aesthetic
feeling
are
here
resolved
into
as
many
different
feelings
each
one
of
which
already
heralded
by
its
predecessor
becomes
perceptible
in
it
and
then
completely
eclipses
it
it
is
this
qualitative
progress
which
we
interpret
as
a
change
of
magnitude
because
we
like
simple
thoughts
and
because
our
language
is
to
render
the
subtleties
of
psychological
analysis
sidenote
the
feeling
of
beauty
art
puts
to
sleep
our
active
and
resistant
powers
and
makes
us
responsive
to
suggestion
to
understand
how
the
feeling
of
the
beautiful
itself
admits
of
degrees
we
should
have
to
submit
it
to
a
minute
analysis
perhaps
the
difficulty
which
we
experience
in
defining
it
is
largely
owing
to
the
fact
that
we
look
upon
the
beauties
of
nature
as
anterior
to
those
of
art
the
processes
of
art
are
thus
supposed
to
be
nothing
more
than
means
by
which
the
artist
expresses
the
beautiful
and
the
essence
of
the
beautiful
remains
unexplained
but
we
might
ask
ourselves
whether
nature
is
beautiful
otherwise
than
through
meeting
by
chance
certain
processes
of
our
art
and
whether
in
a
certain
sense
art
is
not
prior
to
nature
without
even
going
so
far
it
seems
more
in
conformity
with
the
rules
of
a
sound
method
to
study
the
beautiful
first
in
the
works
in
which
it
has
been
produced
by
a
conscious
effort
and
then
to
pass
on
by
imperceptible
steps
from
art
to
nature
which
may
be
looked
upon
as
an
artist
in
its
own
way
by
placing
ourselves
at
this
point
of
view
we
shall
perceive
that
the
object
of
art
is
to
put
to
sleep
the
active
or
rather
resistant
powers
of
our
personality
and
thus
to
bring
us
into
a
state
of
perfect
responsiveness
in
which
we
realize
the
idea
that
is
suggested
to
us
and
sympathize
with
the
feeling
that
is
expressed
in
the
processes
of
art
we
shall
find
in
a
weakened
form
a
refined
and
in
some
measure
spiritualized
version
of
the
processes
commonly
used
to
induce
the
state
of
hypnosis
thus
in
music
the
rhythm
and
measure
suspend
the
normal
flow
of
our
sensations
and
ideas
by
causing
our
attention
to
swing
to
and
fro
between
fixed
points
and
they
take
hold
of
us
with
such
force
that
even
the
faintest
imitation
of
a
groan
will
suffice
to
fill
us
with
the
utmost
sadness
if
musical
sounds
affect
us
more
powerfully
than
the
sounds
of
nature
the
reason
is
that
nature
confines
itself
to
feelings
whereas
music
them
to
us
whence
indeed
comes
the
charm
of
poetry
the
poet
is
he
with
whom
feelings
develop
into
images
and
the
images
themselves
into
words
which
translate
them
while
obeying
the
laws
of
rhythm
in
seeing
these
images
pass
before
our
eyes
we
in
our
turn
experience
the
feeling
which
was
so
to
speak
their
emotional
equivalent
but
we
should
never
realize
these
images
so
strongly
without
the
regular
movements
of
the
rhythm
by
which
our
soul
is
lulled
into
and
as
in
a
dream
thinks
and
sees
with
the
poet
the
plastic
arts
obtain
an
effect
of
the
same
kind
by
the
fixity
which
they
suddenly
impose
upon
life
and
which
a
physical
contagion
carries
over
to
the
attention
of
the
spectator
while
the
works
of
ancient
sculpture
express
faint
emotions
which
play
upon
them
like
a
passing
breath
the
pale
immobility
of
the
stone
causes
the
feeling
expressed
or
the
movement
just
begun
to
appear
as
if
they
were
fixed
for
ever
absorbing
our
thought
and
our
will
in
their
own
eternity
we
find
in
architecture
in
the
very
midst
of
this
startling
immobility
certain
effects
analogous
to
those
of
rhythm
the
symmetry
of
form
the
indefinite
repetition
of
the
same
architectural
motive
causes
our
faculty
of
perception
to
oscillate
between
the
same
and
the
same
again
and
gets
rid
of
those
customary
incessant
changes
which
in
ordinary
life
bring
us
back
without
ceasing
to
the
consciousness
of
our
personality
even
the
faint
suggestion
of
an
idea
will
then
be
enough
to
make
the
idea
fill
the
whole
of
our
mind
thus
art
aims
at
impressing
feelings
on
us
rather
than
expressing
them
it
suggests
them
to
us
and
willingly
dispenses
with
the
imitation
of
nature
when
it
finds
some
more
efficacious
means
nature
like
art
proceeds
by
suggestion
but
does
not
command
the
resources
of
rhythm
it
supplies
the
deficiency
by
the
long
comradeship
based
on
influences
received
in
common
by
nature
and
by
ourselves
of
which
the
effect
is
that
the
slightest
indication
by
nature
of
a
feeling
arouses
sympathy
in
our
minds
just
as
a
mere
gesture
on
the
part
of
the
hypnotist
is
enough
to
force
the
intended
suggestion
upon
a
subject
accustomed
to
his
control
and
this
sympathy
is
shown
in
particular
when
nature
displays
to
us
beings
of
proportions
so
that
our
attention
is
distributed
equally
over
all
the
parts
of
the
figure
without
being
fixed
on
any
one
of
them
our
perceptive
faculty
then
finds
itself
lulled
and
soothed
by
this
harmony
and
nothing
hinders
any
longer
the
free
play
of
sympathy
which
is
ever
ready
to
come
forward
as
soon
as
the
obstacle
in
its
path
is
removed
sidenote
stages
in
the
aesthetic
emotion
it
follows
from
this
analysis
that
the
feeling
of
the
beautiful
is
no
specific
feeling
but
that
every
feeling
experienced
by
us
will
assume
an
aesthetic
character
provided
that
it
has
been
and
not
it
will
now
be
understood
why
the
aesthetic
emotion
seems
to
us
to
admit
of
degrees
of
intensity
and
also
of
degrees
of
elevation
sometimes
the
feeling
which
is
suggested
scarcely
makes
a
break
in
the
compact
texture
of
psychic
phenomena
of
which
our
history
consists
sometimes
it
draws
our
attention
from
them
but
not
so
that
they
become
lost
to
sight
sometimes
finally
it
puts
itself
in
their
place
engrosses
us
and
completely
monopolizes
our
soul
there
are
thus
distinct
phases
in
the
progress
of
an
aesthetic
feeling
as
in
the
state
of
hypnosis
and
these
phases
correspond
less
to
variations
of
degree
than
to
differences
of
state
or
of
nature
but
the
merit
of
a
work
of
art
is
not
measured
so
much
by
the
power
with
which
the
suggested
feeling
takes
hold
of
us
as
by
the
richness
of
this
feeling
itself
in
other
words
besides
degrees
of
intensity
we
instinctively
distinguish
degrees
of
depth
or
elevation
if
this
last
concept
be
analysed
it
will
be
seen
that
the
feelings
and
thoughts
which
the
artist
suggests
to
us
express
and
sum
up
a
more
or
less
considerable
part
of
his
history
if
the
art
which
gives
only
sensations
is
an
inferior
art
the
reason
is
that
analysis
often
fails
to
discover
in
a
sensation
anything
beyond
the
sensation
itself
but
the
greater
number
of
emotions
are
instinct
with
a
thousand
sensations
feelings
or
ideas
which
pervade
them
each
one
is
then
a
state
unique
of
its
kind
and
indefinable
and
it
seems
that
we
should
have
to
the
life
of
the
subject
who
experiences
it
if
we
wished
to
grasp
it
in
its
original
complexity
yet
the
artist
aims
at
giving
us
a
share
in
this
emotion
so
rich
so
personal
so
novel
and
at
enabling
us
to
experience
what
he
can
not
make
us
understand
this
he
will
bring
about
by
choosing
among
the
outward
signs
of
his
emotions
those
which
our
body
is
likely
to
imitate
mechanically
though
slightly
as
soon
as
it
perceives
them
so
as
to
transport
us
all
at
once
into
the
indefinable
psychological
state
which
called
them
forth
thus
will
be
broken
down
the
barrier
interposed
by
time
and
space
between
his
consciousness
and
ours
and
the
richer
in
ideas
and
the
more
pregnant
with
sensations
and
emotions
is
the
feeling
within
whose
limits
the
artist
has
brought
us
the
deeper
and
the
higher
shall
we
find
the
beauty
thus
expressed
the
successive
intensities
of
the
aesthetic
feeling
thus
correspond
to
changes
of
state
occurring
in
us
and
the
degrees
of
depth
to
the
larger
or
smaller
number
of
elementary
psychic
phenomena
which
we
dimly
discern
in
the
fundamental
emotion
sidenote
the
moral
feelings
pity
its
increasing
intensity
is
a
qualitative
progress
the
moral
feelings
might
be
studied
in
the
same
way
let
us
take
pity
as
an
example
it
consists
in
the
first
place
in
putting
oneself
mentally
in
the
place
of
others
in
suffering
their
pain
but
if
it
were
nothing
more
as
some
have
maintained
it
would
inspire
us
with
the
idea
of
avoiding
the
wretched
rather
than
helping
them
for
pain
is
naturally
abhorrent
to
us
this
feeling
of
horror
may
indeed
be
at
the
root
of
pity
but
a
new
element
soon
comes
in
the
need
of
helping
our
and
of
alleviating
their
suffering
shall
we
say
with
la
rochefoucauld
that
this
sympathy
is
a
calculation
a
shrewd
insurance
against
evils
to
come
perhaps
a
dread
of
some
future
evil
to
ourselves
does
hold
a
place
in
our
compassion
for
other
evil
these
however
are
but
lower
forms
of
pity
true
pity
consists
not
so
much
in
fearing
suffering
as
in
desiring
it
the
desire
is
a
faint
one
and
we
should
hardly
wish
to
see
it
realized
yet
we
form
it
in
spite
of
ourselves
as
if
nature
were
committing
some
great
injustice
and
it
were
necessary
to
get
rid
of
all
suspicion
of
complicity
with
her
the
essence
of
pity
is
thus
a
need
for
an
aspiration
downwards
this
painful
aspiration
nevertheless
has
a
charm
about
it
because
it
raises
us
in
our
own
estimation
and
makes
us
feel
superior
to
those
sensuous
goods
from
which
our
thought
is
temporarily
detached
the
increasing
intensity
of
pity
thus
consists
in
a
qualitative
progress
in
a
transition
from
repugnance
to
fear
from
fear
to
sympathy
and
from
sympathy
itself
to
humility
sidenote
conscious
states
connected
with
external
causes
or
involving
psychical
symptoms
we
do
not
propose
to
carry
this
analysis
any
further
the
psychic
states
whose
intensity
we
have
just
defined
are
states
which
do
not
seem
to
have
any
close
relation
to
their
external
cause
or
to
involve
the
perception
of
muscular
contraction
but
such
states
are
rare
there
is
hardly
any
passion
or
desire
any
joy
or
sorrow
which
is
not
accompanied
by
physical
symptoms
and
where
these
symptoms
occur
they
probably
count
for
something
in
the
estimate
of
intensities
as
for
the
sensations
properly
so
called
they
are
manifestly
connected
with
their
external
cause
and
though
the
intensity
of
the
sensation
can
not
be
defined
by
the
magnitude
of
its
cause
there
undoubtedly
exists
some
relation
between
these
two
terms
in
some
of
its
manifestations
consciousness
even
appears
to
spread
outwards
as
if
intensity
were
being
developed
into
extensity
in
the
case
of
muscular
effort
let
us
face
this
last
phenomenon
at
once
we
shall
thus
be
transported
at
a
bound
to
the
opposite
extremity
of
the
series
of
psychic
phenomena
sidenote
muscular
effort
seems
at
first
sight
to
be
quantitative
if
there
is
a
phenomenon
which
seems
to
be
presented
immediately
to
consciousness
under
the
form
of
quantity
or
at
least
of
magnitude
it
is
undoubtedly
muscular
effort
we
picture
to
our
minds
a
psychic
force
imprisoned
in
the
soul
like
the
winds
in
the
cave
of
aeolus
and
only
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
burst
forth
our
will
is
supposed
to
watch
over
this
force
and
from
time
to
time
to
open
a
passage
for
it
regulating
the
outflow
by
the
effect
which
it
is
desired
to
produce
if
we
consider
the
matter
carefully
we
shall
see
that
this
somewhat
crude
conception
of
effort
plays
a
large
part
in
our
belief
in
intensive
magnitudes
muscular
force
whose
sphere
of
action
is
space
and
which
manifests
itself
in
phenomena
admitting
of
measure
seems
to
us
to
have
existed
previous
to
its
manifestations
but
in
smaller
volume
and
so
to
speak
in
a
compressed
state
hence
we
do
not
hesitate
to
reduce
this
volume
more
and
more
and
finally
we
believe
that
we
can
understand
how
a
purely
psychic
state
which
does
not
occupy
space
can
nevertheless
possess
magnitude
science
too
tends
to
strengthen
the
illusion
of
common
sense
with
regard
to
this
point
bain
for
example
declares
that
the
sensibility
accompanying
muscular
movement
coincides
with
the
stream
of
nervous
energy
it
is
thus
just
the
emission
of
nervous
force
which
consciousness
perceives
wundt
also
speaks
of
a
sensation
central
in
its
origin
accompanying
the
voluntary
innervation
of
the
muscles
and
quotes
the
example
of
the
paralytic
who
has
a
very
distinct
sensation
of
the
force
which
he
employs
in
the
effort
to
raise
his
leg
although
it
remains
motionless
most
of
the
authorities
adhere
to
this
opinion
which
would
be
the
unanimous
view
of
positive
science
were
it
not
that
several
years
ago
professor
william
james
drew
the
attention
of
physiologists
to
certain
phenomena
which
had
been
but
little
remarked
although
they
were
very
remarkable
sidenote
the
feeling
of
effort
we
are
conscious
not
of
an
expenditure
of
force
but
of
the
resulting
muscular
movement
when
a
paralytic
strives
to
raise
his
useless
limb
he
certainly
does
not
execute
this
movement
but
with
or
without
his
will
he
executes
another
some
movement
is
carried
out
somewhere
otherwise
there
is
no
sensation
of
effort
vulpian
had
already
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
if
a
man
affected
with
hemiplegia
is
told
to
clench
his
paralysed
fist
he
unconsciously
carries
out
this
action
with
the
fist
which
is
not
affected
ferrier
described
a
still
more
curious
phenomenon
stretch
out
your
arm
while
slightly
bending
your
forefinger
as
if
you
were
going
to
press
the
trigger
of
a
pistol
without
moving
the
finger
without
contracting
any
muscle
of
the
hand
without
producing
any
apparent
movement
you
will
yet
be
able
to
feel
that
you
are
expending
energy
on
a
closer
examination
however
you
will
perceive
that
this
sensation
of
effort
coincides
with
the
fixation
of
the
muscles
of
your
chest
that
you
keep
your
glottis
closed
and
actively
contract
your
respiratory
muscles
as
soon
as
respiration
resumes
its
normal
course
the
consciousness
of
effort
vanishes
unless
you
really
move
your
finger
these
facts
already
seemed
to
show
that
we
are
conscious
not
of
an
expenditure
of
force
but
of
the
movement
of
the
muscles
which
results
from
it
the
new
feature
in
professor
james
investigation
is
that
he
has
verified
the
hypothesis
in
the
case
of
examples
which
seemed
to
contradict
it
absolutely
thus
when
the
external
rectus
muscle
of
the
right
eye
is
paralysed
the
patient
tries
in
vain
to
turn
his
eye
towards
the
right
yet
objects
seem
to
him
to
recede
towards
the
right
and
since
the
act
of
volition
has
produced
no
effect
it
follows
said
helmholtz
that
he
is
conscious
of
the
effort
of
volition
but
replies
professor
james
no
account
has
been
taken
of
what
goes
on
in
the
other
eye
this
remains
covered
during
the
experiments
nevertheless
it
moves
and
there
is
not
much
trouble
in
proving
that
it
does
it
is
the
movement
of
the
left
eye
perceived
by
consciousness
which
produces
the
sensation
of
effort
together
with
the
impression
that
the
objects
perceived
by
the
right
eye
are
moving
these
and
similar
observations
lead
professor
james
to
assert
that
the
feeling
of
effort
is
centripetal
and
not
centrifugal
we
are
not
conscious
of
a
force
which
we
are
supposed
to
launch
upon
our
organism
our
feeling
of
muscular
energy
at
work
is
a
complex
afferent
sensation
which
comes
from
contracted
muscles
stretched
ligaments
compressed
joints
an
immobilized
chest
a
closed
glottis
a
knit
brow
clenched
jaws
in
a
word
from
all
the
points
of
the
periphery
where
the
effort
causes
an
alteration
sidenote
intensity
of
feeling
of
effort
proportional
to
extent
of
our
body
affected
it
is
not
for
us
to
take
a
side
in
the
dispute
after
all
the
question
with
which
we
have
to
deal
is
not
whether
the
feeling
of
effort
comes
from
the
centre
or
the
periphery
but
in
what
does
our
perception
of
its
intensity
exactly
consist
now
it
is
sufficient
to
observe
oneself
attentively
to
reach
a
conclusion
on
this
point
which
professor
james
has
not
formulated
but
which
seems
to
us
quite
in
accord
with
the
spirit
of
his
teaching
we
maintain
that
the
more
a
given
effort
seems
to
us
to
increase
the
greater
is
the
number
of
muscles
which
contract
in
sympathy
with
it
and
that
the
apparent
consciousness
of
a
greater
intensity
of
effort
at
a
given
point
of
the
organism
is
reducible
in
reality
to
the
perception
of
a
larger
surface
of
the
body
being
affected
sidenote
our
consciousness
of
an
increase
of
muscular
effort
consists
in
the
perception
of
a
greater
number
of
peripheral
sensations
a
qualitative
change
in
some
of
them
try
for
example
to
clench
the
fist
with
increasing
force
you
will
have
the
impression
of
a
sensation
of
effort
entirely
localized
in
your
hand
and
running
up
a
scale
of
magnitudes
in
reality
what
you
experience
in
your
hand
remains
the
same
but
the
sensation
which
was
at
first
localized
there
has
affected
your
arm
and
ascended
to
the
shoulder
finally
the
other
arm
stiffens
both
legs
do
the
same
the
respiration
is
checked
it
is
the
whole
body
which
is
at
work
but
you
fail
to
notice
distinctly
all
these
concomitant
movements
unless
you
are
warned
of
them
till
then
you
thought
you
were
dealing
with
a
single
state
of
consciousness
which
changed
in
magnitude
when
you
press
your
lips
more
and
more
tightly
against
one
another
you
believe
that
you
are
experiencing
in
your
lips
one
and
the
same
sensation
which
is
continually
increasing
in
strength
here
again
further
reflection
will
show
you
that
this
sensation
remains
identical
but
that
certain
muscles
of
the
face
and
the
head
and
then
of
all
the
rest
of
the
body
have
taken
part
in
the
operation
you
felt
this
gradual
encroachment
this
increase
of
the
surface
affected
which
is
in
truth
a
change
of
quantity
but
as
your
attention
was
concentrated
on
your
closed
lips
you
localized
the
increase
there
and
you
made
the
psychic
force
there
expended
into
a
magnitude
although
it
possessed
no
extensity
examine
carefully
somebody
who
is
lifting
heavier
and
heavier
weights
the
muscular
contraction
gradually
spreads
over
his
whole
body
as
for
the
special
sensation
which
he
experiences
in
the
arm
which
is
at
work
it
remains
constant
for
a
very
long
time
and
hardly
changes
except
in
quality
the
weight
becoming
at
a
certain
moment
fatigue
and
the
fatigue
pain
yet
the
subject
will
imagine
that
he
is
conscious
of
a
continual
increase
in
the
psychic
force
flowing
into
his
arm
he
will
not
recognize
his
mistake
unless
he
is
warned
of
it
so
inclined
is
he
to
measure
a
given
psychic
state
by
the
conscious
movements
which
accompany
it
from
these
facts
and
from
many
others
of
the
same
kind
we
believe
we
can
deduce
the
following
conclusion
our
consciousness
of
an
increase
of
muscular
effort
is
reducible
to
the
twofold
perception
of
a
greater
number
of
peripheral
sensations
and
of
a
qualitative
change
occurring
in
some
of
them
sidenote
the
same
definition
of
intensity
applies
to
superficial
efforts
feelings
and
states
intermediate
between
the
two
we
are
thus
led
to
define
the
intensity
of
a
superficial
effort
in
the
same
way
as
that
of
a
cases
there
is
a
qualitative
progress
and
an
increasing
complexity
indistinctly
perceived
but
consciousness
accustomed
to
think
in
terms
of
space
and
to
translate
its
thoughts
into
words
will
denote
the
feeling
by
a
single
word
and
will
localize
the
effort
at
the
exact
point
where
it
yields
a
useful
result
it
will
then
become
aware
of
an
effort
which
is
always
of
the
same
nature
and
increases
at
the
spot
assigned
to
it
and
a
feeling
which
retaining
the
same
name
grows
without
changing
its
nature
now
the
same
illusion
of
consciousness
is
likely
to
be
met
with
again
in
the
case
of
the
states
which
are
intermediate
between
superficial
efforts
and
feelings
a
large
number
of
psychic
states
are
accompanied
in
fact
by
muscular
contractions
and
peripheral
sensations
sometimes
these
superficial
elements
are
by
a
purely
speculative
idea
sometimes
by
an
idea
of
a
practical
order
in
the
first
case
there
is
intellectual
effort
or
attention
in
the
second
we
have
the
emotions
which
may
be
called
violent
or
acute
anger
terror
and
certain
varieties
of
joy
sorrow
passion
and
desire
let
us
show
briefly
that
the
same
definition
of
intensity
applies
to
these
intermediate
states
sidenote
the
intermediate
states
attention
and
its
relation
to
muscular
contraction
attention
is
not
a
purely
physiological
phenomenon
but
we
can
not
deny
that
it
is
accompanied
by
movements
these
movements
are
neither
the
cause
nor
the
result
of
the
phenomenon
they
are
part
of
it
they
express
it
in
terms
of
space
as
ribot
has
so
remarkably
proved
fechner
had
already
reduced
the
effort
of
attention
in
a
to
the
muscular
feeling
produced
by
putting
in
motion
by
a
sort
of
reflex
action
the
muscles
which
are
correlated
with
the
different
sense
organs
he
had
noticed
the
very
distinct
sensation
of
tension
and
contraction
of
the
scalp
the
pressure
from
without
inwards
over
the
whole
skull
which
we
experience
when
we
make
a
great
effort
to
recall
something
ribot
has
studied
more
closely
the
movements
which
are
characteristic
of
voluntary
attention
attention
contracts
the
frontal
muscle
this
muscle
draws
the
eyebrow
towards
itself
raises
it
and
causes
transverse
wrinkles
on
the
forehead
in
extreme
cases
the
mouth
is
opened
wide
with
children
and
with
many
adults
eager
attention
gives
rise
to
a
protrusion
of
the
lips
a
kind
of
pout
certainly
a
purely
psychic
factor
will
always
enter
into
voluntary
attention
even
if
it
be
nothing
more
than
the
exclusion
by
the
will
of
all
ideas
foreign
to
the
one
with
which
the
subject
wishes
to
occupy
himself
but
once
this
exclusion
is
made
we
believe
that
we
are
still
conscious
of
a
growing
tension
of
soul
of
an
immaterial
effort
which
increases
analyse
this
impression
and
you
will
find
nothing
but
the
feeling
of
a
muscular
contraction
which
spreads
over
a
wider
surface
or
changes
its
nature
so
that
the
tension
becomes
pressure
fatigue
and
pain
sidenote
the
intensity
of
violent
emotions
as
muscular
tension
now
we
do
not
see
any
essential
difference
between
the
effort
of
attention
and
what
may
be
the
intensity
called
the
effort
of
psychic
tension
acute
desire
uncontrolled
anger
passionate
love
violent
hatred
each
of
these
states
may
be
reduced
we
believe
to
a
system
of
muscular
contractions
by
an
idea
but
in
the
case
of
attention
it
is
the
more
or
less
reflective
idea
of
knowing
in
the
case
of
emotion
the
unreflective
idea
of
acting
the
intensity
of
these
violent
emotions
is
thus
likely
to
be
nothing
but
the
muscular
tension
which
accompanies
them
darwin
has
given
a
remarkable
description
of
the
physiological
symptoms
of
rage
the
action
of
the
heart
is
much
accelerated
the
face
reddens
or
may
turn
deadly
pale
the
respiration
is
laboured
the
chest
heaves
and
the
dilated
nostrils
quiver
the
whole
body
often
trembles
the
voice
is
affected
the
teeth
are
clenched
or
ground
together
and
the
muscular
system
is
commonly
stimulated
to
violent
almost
frantic
action
the
gestures
represent
more
or
less
plainly
the
act
of
striking
or
fighting
with
an
enemy
we
shall
not
go
so
far
as
to
maintain
with
professor
james
that
the
emotion
of
rage
is
reducible
to
the
sum
of
these
organic
sensations
there
will
always
be
an
irreducible
psychic
element
in
anger
if
this
be
only
the
idea
of
striking
or
fighting
of
which
darwin
speaks
and
which
gives
a
common
direction
to
so
many
diverse
movements
but
though
this
idea
determines
the
direction
of
the
emotional
state
and
the
accompanying
movements
the
growing
intensity
of
the
state
itself
is
we
believe
nothing
but
the
deeper
and
deeper
disturbance
of
the
organism
a
disturbance
which
consciousness
has
no
difficulty
in
measuring
by
the
number
and
extent
of
the
bodily
surfaces
concerned
it
will
be
useless
to
assert
that
there
is
a
restrained
rage
which
is
all
the
more
intense
the
reason
is
that
where
emotion
has
free
play
consciousness
does
not
dwell
on
the
details
of
the
accompanying
movements
but
it
does
dwell
upon
them
and
is
concentrated
upon
them
when
its
object
is
to
conceal
them
eliminate
in
short
all
trace
of
organic
disturbance
all
tendency
towards
muscular
contraction
and
all
that
will
be
left
of
anger
will
be
the
idea
or
if
you
still
insist
on
making
it
an
emotion
you
will
be
unable
to
assign
it
any
intensity
sidenote
intensity
and
reflex
movements
no
essential
difference
between
intensity
of
feelings
and
that
of
violent
emotions
fear
when
strong
says
herbert
spencer
expresses
itself
in
cries
in
efforts
to
escape
in
palpitations
in
tremblings
we
go
further
and
maintain
that
these
movements
form
part
of
the
terror
itself
by
their
means
the
terror
becomes
an
emotion
capable
of
passing
through
different
degrees
of
intensity
suppress
them
entirely
and
the
more
or
less
intense
state
of
terror
will
be
succeeded
by
an
idea
of
terror
the
wholly
intellectual
representation
of
a
danger
which
it
concerns
us
to
avoid
there
are
also
high
degrees
of
joy
and
sorrow
of
desire
aversion
and
even
shame
the
height
of
which
will
be
found
to
be
nothing
but
the
reflex
movements
begun
by
the
organism
and
perceived
by
consciousness
when
lovers
meet
says
darwin
we
know
that
their
hearts
beat
quickly
their
breathing
is
hurried
and
their
faces
flushed
aversion
is
marked
by
movements
of
repugnance
which
we
repeat
without
noticing
when
we
think
of
the
object
of
our
dislike
we
blush
and
involuntarily
clench
the
fingers
when
we
feel
shame
even
if
it
be
retrospective
the
acuteness
of
these
emotions
is
estimated
by
the
number
and
nature
of
the
peripheral
sensations
which
accompany
them
little
by
little
and
in
proportion
as
the
emotional
state
loses
its
violence
and
gains
in
depth
the
peripheral
sensations
will
give
place
to
inner
states
it
will
be
no
longer
our
outward
movements
but
our
ideas
our
memories
our
states
of
consciousness
of
every
description
which
will
turn
in
larger
or
smaller
numbers
in
a
definite
direction
there
is
then
no
essential
difference
from
the
point
of
view
of
intensity
between
the
feelings
of
which
we
spoke
at
the
beginning
and
the
acute
or
violent
emotions
which
we
have
just
passed
in
review
to
say
that
love
hatred
desire
increase
in
violence
is
to
assert
that
they
are
projected
outwards
that
they
radiate
to
the
surface
that
peripheral
sensations
are
substituted
for
inner
states
but
superficial
or
violent
or
reflective
the
intensity
of
these
feelings
always
consists
in
the
multiplicity
of
simple
states
which
consciousness
dimly
discerns
in
them
sidenote
magnitude
of
sensations
affective
and
representative
sensations
we
have
hitherto
confined
ourselves
to
feelings
and
efforts
complex
states
the
intensity
of
which
does
not
absolutely
depend
on
an
external
cause
but
sensations
seem
to
us
simple
states
in
what
will
their
magnitude
consist
the
intensity
of
sensations
varies
with
the
external
cause
of
which
they
are
said
to
be
the
conscious
equivalent
how
shall
we
explain
the
presence
of
quantity
in
an
effect
which
is
inextensive
and
in
this
case
indivisible
to
answer
this
question
we
must
first
distinguish
between
the
affective
and
the
representative
sensations
there
is
no
doubt
that
we
pass
gradually
from
the
one
to
the
other
and
that
some
affective
element
enters
into
the
majority
of
our
simple
representations
but
nothing
prevents
us
from
isolating
this
element
and
inquiring
separately
in
what
does
the
intensity
of
an
affective
sensation
a
pleasure
or
a
pain
consist
sidenote
affective
sensations
and
organic
disturbance
perhaps
the
difficulty
of
the
latter
problem
is
principally
due
to
the
fact
that
we
are
unwilling
to
see
in
the
affective
state
anything
but
the
conscious
expression
of
an
organic
disturbance
the
inward
echo
of
an
outward
cause
we
notice
that
a
more
intense
sensation
generally
corresponds
to
a
greater
nervous
disturbance
but
inasmuch
as
these
disturbances
are
unconscious
as
movements
since
they
come
before
consciousness
in
the
guise
of
a
sensation
which
has
no
resemblance
at
all
to
motion
we
do
not
see
how
they
could
transmit
to
the
sensation
anything
of
their
own
magnitude
for
there
is
nothing
in
common
we
repeat
between
superposable
magnitudes
such
as
for
example
and
sensations
which
do
not
occupy
space
if
the
more
intense
sensation
seems
to
us
to
contain
the
less
intense
if
it
assumes
for
us
like
the
physical
impression
itself
the
form
of
a
magnitude
the
reason
probably
is
that
it
retains
something
of
the
physical
impression
to
which
it
corresponds
and
it
will
retain
nothing
of
it
if
it
is
merely
the
conscious
translation
of
a
movement
of
molecules
for
just
because
this
movement
is
translated
into
the
sensation
of
pleasure
or
pain
it
remains
unconscious
as
molecular
movement
sidenote
pleasure
and
pain
as
signs
of
the
future
reaction
rather
than
psychic
translations
of
the
past
stimulus
but
it
might
be
asked
whether
pleasure
and
pain
instead
of
expressing
only
what
has
just
occurred
or
what
is
actually
occurring
in
the
organism
as
is
usually
believed
could
not
also
point
out
what
is
going
to
or
what
is
tending
to
take
place
it
seems
indeed
somewhat
improbable
that
nature
so
profoundly
utilitarian
should
have
here
assigned
to
consciousness
the
merely
scientific
task
of
informing
us
about
the
past
or
the
present
which
no
longer
depend
upon
us
it
must
be
noticed
in
addition
that
we
rise
by
imperceptible
stages
from
automatic
to
free
movements
and
that
the
latter
differ
from
the
former
principally
in
introducing
an
affective
sensation
between
the
external
action
which
occasions
them
and
the
volitional
reaction
which
ensues
indeed
all
our
actions
might
have
been
automatic
and
we
can
surmise
that
there
are
many
organized
beings
in
whose
case
an
external
stimulus
causes
a
definite
reaction
without
calling
up
consciousness
as
an
intermediate
agent
if
pleasure
and
pain
make
their
appearance
in
certain
privileged
beings
it
is
probably
to
call
forth
a
resistance
to
the
automatic
reaction
which
would
have
taken
place
either
sensation
has
nothing
to
do
or
it
is
nascent
freedom
but
how
would
it
enable
us
to
resist
the
reaction
which
is
in
preparation
if
it
did
not
acquaint
us
with
the
nature
of
the
latter
by
some
definite
sign
and
what
can
this
sign
be
except
the
sketching
and
as
it
were
the
prefiguring
of
the
future
automatic
movements
in
the
very
midst
of
the
sensation
which
is
being
experienced
the
affective
state
must
then
correspond
not
merely
to
the
physical
disturbances
movements
or
phenomena
which
have
taken
place
but
also
and
especially
to
those
which
are
in
preparation
those
which
are
getting
ready
to
be
sidenote
intensity
of
affective
sensations
would
then
be
our
consciousness
of
the
involuntary
movements
tending
to
follow
the
stimulus
it
is
certainly
not
obvious
at
first
sight
how
this
hypothesis
simplifies
the
problem
for
we
are
trying
to
find
what
there
can
be
in
common
from
the
point
of
view
of
magnitude
between
a
physical
phenomenon
and
a
state
of
consciousness
and
we
seem
to
have
merely
turned
the
difficulty
round
by
making
the
present
state
of
consciousness
a
sign
of
the
future
reaction
rather
than
a
psychic
translation
of
the
past
stimulus
but
the
difference
between
the
two
hypotheses
is
considerable
for
the
molecular
disturbances
which
were
mentioned
just
now
are
necessarily
unconscious
since
no
trace
of
the
movements
themselves
can
be
actually
perceived
in
the
sensation
which
translates
them
but
the
automatic
movements
which
tend
to
follow
the
stimulus
as
its
natural
outcome
are
likely
to
be
conscious
as
movements
or
else
the
sensation
itself
whose
function
is
to
invite
us
to
choose
between
this
automatic
reaction
and
other
possible
movements
would
be
of
no
avail
the
intensity
of
affective
sensations
might
thus
be
nothing
more
than
our
consciousness
of
the
involuntary
movements
which
are
being
begun
and
outlined
so
to
speak
within
these
states
and
which
would
have
gone
on
in
their
own
way
if
nature
had
made
us
automata
instead
of
conscious
beings
sidenote
intensity
of
a
pain
estimated
by
extent
of
organism
affected
if
such
be
the
case
we
shall
not
compare
a
pain
of
increasing
intensity
to
a
note
which
grows
louder
and
louder
but
rather
to
a
symphony
in
which
an
increasing
number
of
instruments
make
themselves
heard
within
the
characteristic
sensation
which
gives
the
tone
to
all
the
others
consciousness
distinguishes
a
larger
or
smaller
number
of
sensations
arising
at
different
points
of
the
periphery
muscular
contractions
organic
movements
of
every
kind
the
choir
of
these
elementary
psychic
states
voices
the
new
demands
of
the
organism
when
confronted
by
a
new
situation
in
other
words
we
estimate
the
intensity
of
a
pain
by
the
larger
or
smaller
part
of
the
organism
which
takes
interest
in
it
richet
has
observed
that
the
slighter
the
pain
the
more
precisely
is
it
referred
to
a
particular
spot
if
it
becomes
more
intense
it
is
referred
to
the
whole
of
the
member
affected
and
he
concludes
by
saying
that
the
pain
spreads
in
proportion
as
it
is
more
intense
we
should
rather
reverse
the
sentence
and
define
the
intensity
of
the
pain
by
the
very
number
and
extent
of
the
parts
of
the
body
which
sympathize
with
it
and
react
and
whose
reactions
are
perceived
by
consciousness
to
convince
ourselves
of
this
it
will
be
enough
to
read
the
remarkable
description
of
disgust
given
by
the
same
author
if
the
stimulus
is
slight
there
may
be
neither
nausea
nor
vomiting
if
the
stimulus
is
stronger
instead
of
being
confined
to
the
nerve
it
spreads
and
affects
almost
the
whole
organic
system
the
face
turns
pale
the
smooth
muscles
of
the
skin

the
skin

covered
with
a
cold
perspiration
the
heart
stops
beating
in
a
word
there
is
a
general
organic
disturbance
following
the
stimulation
of
the
medulla
oblongata
and
this
disturbance
is
the
supreme
expression
of
disgust
but
is
it
nothing
more
than
its
expression
in
what
will
the
general
sensation
of
disgust
consist
if
not
in
the
sum
of
these
elementary
sensations
and
what
can
we
understand
here
by
increasing
intensity
if
it
is
not
the
constantly
increasing
number
of
sensations
which
join
in
with
the
sensations
already
experienced
darwin
has
drawn
a
striking
picture
of
the
reactions
following
a
pain
which
becomes
more
and
more
acute
great
pain
urges
all
animals
to
make
the
most
violent
and
diversified
efforts
to
escape

mouth
may
be
closely
compressed

more
commonly

wildly

the

are

contracted

and

is
it
not
by
this
very
contraction
of
the
muscles
affected
that
we
measure
the
intensity
of
a
pain
analyse
your
idea
of
any
suffering
which
you
call
extreme
do
you
not
mean
that
it
is
unbearable
that
is
to
say
that
it
urges
the
organism
to
a
thousand
different
actions
in
order
to
escape
from
it
i
can
picture
to
myself
a
nerve
transmitting
a
pain
which
is
independent
of
all
automatic
reaction
and
i
can
equally
understand
that
stronger
or
weaker
stimulations
influence
this
nerve
differently
but
i
do
not
see
how
these
differences
of
sensation
would
be
interpreted
by
our
consciousness
as
differences
of
quantity
unless
we
connected
them
with
the
reactions
which
usually
accompany
them
and
which
are
more
or
less
extended
and
more
or
less
important
without
these
subsequent
reactions
the
intensity
of
the
pain
would
be
a
quality
and
not
a
magnitude
sidenote
pleasures
compared
by
bodily
inclination
we
have
hardly
any
other
means
of
comparing
several
pleasures
with
one
another
what
do
we
mean
by
a
greater
pleasure
except
a
pleasure
that
is
preferred
and
what
can
our
preference
be
except
a
certain
disposition
of
our
organs
the
effect
of
which
is
that
when
two
pleasures
are
offered
simultaneously
to
our
mind
our
body
inclines
towards
one
of
them
analyse
this
inclination
itself
and
you
will
find
a
great
many
little
movements
which
begin
and
become
perceptible
in
the
organs
concerned
and
even
in
the
rest
of
the
body
as
if
the
organism
were
coming
forth
to
meet
the
pleasure
as
soon
as
it
is
pictured
when
we
define
inclination
as
a
movement
we
are
not
using
a
metaphor
when
confronted
by
several
pleasures
pictured
by
our
mind
our
body
turns
towards
one
of
them
spontaneously
as
though
by
a
reflex
action
it
rests
with
us
to
check
it
but
the
attraction
of
the
pleasure
is
nothing
but
this
movement
that
is
begun
and
the
very
keenness
of
the
pleasure
while
we
enjoy
it
is
merely
the
inertia
of
the
organism
which
is
immersed
in
it
and
rejects
every
other
sensation
without
this
of
which
we
become
conscious
by
the
very
resistance
which
we
offer
to
anything
that
might
distract
us
pleasure
would
be
a
state
but
no
longer
a
magnitude
in
the
moral
as
in
the
physical
world
attraction
serves
to
define
movement
rather
than
to
produce
it
sidenote
the
intensity
of
representative
sensations
many
also
affective
and
intensity
is
measured
by
reaction
called
forth
in
others
a
new
element
enters
we
have
studied
the
affective
sensations
separately
but
we
must
now
notice
that
many
representative
sensations
possess
an
affective
character
and
thus
call
forth
a
reaction
on
our
part
which
we
take
into
account
in
estimating
their
intensity
a
considerable
increase
of
light
is
represented
for
us
by
a
characteristic
sensation
which
is
not
yet
pain
but
which
is
analogous
to
dazzling
in
proportion
as
the
amplitude
of
increases
our
head
and
then
our
body
seem
to
us
to
vibrate
or
to
receive
a
shock
certain
representative
sensations
those
of
taste
smell
and
temperature
have
a
fixed
character
of
pleasantness
or
unpleasantness
between
flavours
which
are
more
or
less
bitter
you
will
hardly
distinguish
anything
but
differences
of
quality
they
are
like
different
shades
of
one
and
the
same
colour
but
these
differences
of
quality
are
at
once
interpreted
as
differences
of
quantity
because
of
their
affective
character
and
the
more
or
less
pronounced
movements
of
reaction
pleasure
or
repugnance
which
they
suggest
to
us
besides
even
when
the
sensation
remains
purely
representative
its
external
cause
can
not
exceed
a
certain
degree
of
strength
or
weakness
without
inciting
us
to
movements
which
enable
us
to
measure
it
sometimes
indeed
we
have
to
make
an
effort
to
perceive
this
sensation
as
if
it
were
trying
to
escape
notice
sometimes
on
the
other
hand
it
obsesses
us
forces
itself
upon
us
and
engrosses
us
to
such
an
extent
that
we
make
every
effort
to
escape
from
it
and
to
remain
ourselves
in
the
former
case
the
sensation
is
said
to
be
of
slight
intensity
and
in
the
latter
case
very
intense
thus
in
order
to
perceive
a
distant
sound
to
distinguish
what
we
call
a
faint
smell
or
a
dim
light
we
strain
all
our
faculties
we
pay
attention
and
it
is
just
because
the
smell
and
the
light
thus
require
to
be
reinforced
by
our
efforts
that
they
seem
to
us
feeble
and
inversely
we
recognize
a
sensation
of
extreme
intensity
by
the
irresistible
reflex
movements
to
which
it
incites
us
or
by
the
powerlessness
with
which
it
affects
us
when
a
cannon
is
fired
off
close
to
our
ears
or
a
dazzling
light
suddenly
flares
up
we
lose
for
an
instant
the
consciousness
of
our
personality
this
state
may
even
last
some
time
in
the
case
of
a
very
nervous
subject
it
must
be
added
that
even
within
the
range
of
the
medium
intensities
when
we
are
dealing
on
even
terms
with
a
representative
sensation
we
often
estimate
its
importance
by
comparing
it
with
another
which
it
drives
away
or
by
taking
account
of
the
persistence
with
which
it
returns
thus
the
ticking
of
a
watch
seems
louder
at
night
because
it
easily
monopolizes
a
consciousness
almost
empty
of
sensations
and
ideas
foreigners
talking
to
one
another
in
a
language
which
we
do
not
understand
seem
to
us
to
speak
very
loudly
because
their
words
no
longer
call
up
any
ideas
in
our
mind
and
thus
break
in
upon
a
kind
of
intellectual
silence
and
monopolize
our
attention
like
the
ticking
of
a
watch
at
night
with
these
medium
sensations
however
we
approach
a
series
of
psychic
states
the
intensity
of
which
is
likely
to
possess
a
new
meaning
for
in
most
cases
the
organism
hardly
reacts
at
all
at
least
in
a
way
that
can
be
perceived
and
yet
we
still
make
a
magnitude
out
of
the
pitch
of
a
sound
the
intensity
of
a
light
the
saturation
of
a
colour
doubtless
a
closer
observation
of
what
takes
place
in
the
whole
of
the
organism
when
we
hear
such
and
such
a
note
or
perceive
such
and
such
a
colour
has
more
than
one
surprise
in
store
for
us
has
not
féré
shown
that
every
sensation
is
accompanied
by
an
increase
in
muscular
force
which
can
be
measured
by
the
dynamometer
but
of
an
increase
of
this
kind
there
is
hardly
any
consciousness
at
all
and
if
we
reflect
on
the
precision
with
which
we
distinguish
sounds
and
colours
nay
even
weights
and
temperatures
we
shall
easily
guess
that
some
new
element
must
come
into
play
in
our
estimate
of
them
sidenote
the
purely
representative
sensations
are
measured
by
external
causes
now
the
nature
of
this
element
is
easy
to
determine
for
in
proportion
as
a
sensation
loses
its
affective
character
and
becomes
representative
the
reactions
which
it
called
forth
on
our
part
tend
to
disappear
but
at
the
same
time
we
perceive
the
external
object
which
is
its
cause
or
if
we
do
not
now
perceive
it
we
have
perceived
it
and
we
think
of
it
now
this
cause
is
extensive
and
therefore
measurable
a
constant
experience
which
began
with
the
first
glimmerings
of
consciousness
and
which
continues
throughout
the
whole
of
our
life
shows
us
a
definite
shade
of
sensation
corresponding
to
a
definite
amount
of
stimulation
we
thus
associate
the
idea
of
a
certain
quantity
of
cause
with
a
certain
quality
of
effect
and
finally
as
happens
in
the
case
of
every
acquired
perception
we
transfer
the
idea
into
the
sensation
the
quantity
of
the
cause
into
the
quality
of
the
effect
at
this
very
moment
the
intensity
which
was
nothing
but
a
certain
shade
or
quality
of
the
sensation
becomes
a
magnitude
we
shall
easily
understand
this
process
if
for
example
we
hold
a
pin
in
our
right
hand
and
prick
our
left
hand
more
and
more
deeply
at
first
we
shall
feel
as
it
were
a
tickling
then
a
touch
which
is
succeeded
by
a
prick
then
a
pain
localized
at
a
point
and
finally
the
spreading
of
this
pain
over
the
surrounding
zone
and
the
more
we
reflect
on
it
the
more
clearly
shall
we
see
that
we
are
here
dealing
with
so
many
qualitatively
distinct
sensations
so
many
varieties
of
a
single
species
but
yet
we
spoke
at
first
of
one
and
the
same
sensation
which
spread
further
and
further
of
one
prick
which
increased
in
intensity
the
reason
is
that
without
noticing
it
we
localized
in
the
sensation
of
the
left
hand
which
is
pricked
the
progressive
effort
of
the
right
hand
which
pricks
we
thus
introduced
the
cause
into
the
effect
and
unconsciously
interpreted
quality
as
quantity
intensity
as
magnitude
now
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
intensity
of
every
representative
sensation
ought
to
be
understood
in
the
same
way
sidenote
the
sensations
of
sound
intensity
measured
by
effort
necessary
to
produce
a
similar
sound
the
sensations
of
sound
display
well
marked
degrees
of
intensity
we
have
already
spoken
of
the
necessity
of
taking
into
account
the
affective
character
of
these
sensations
the
shock
received
by
the
whole
of
the
organism
we
have
shown
that
a
very
intense
sound
is
one
which
engrosses
our
attention
which
supplants
all
the
others
but
take
away
the
shock
the
vibration
which
you
sometimes
feel
in
your
head
or
even
throughout
your
body
take
away
the
clash
which
takes
place
between
sounds
heard
simultaneously
what
will
be
left
except
an
indefinable
quality
of
the
sound
which
is
heard
but
this
quality
is
immediately
interpreted
as
quantity
because
you
have
obtained
it
yourself
a
thousand
times
by
striking
some
object
and
thus
expending
a
definite
quantity
of
effort
you
know
too
how
far
you
would
have
to
raise
your
voice
to
produce
a
similar
sound
and
the
idea
of
this
effort
immediately
comes
into
your
mind
when
you
transform
the
intensity
of
the
sound
into
a
magnitude
wundt
has
drawn
attention
to
the
quite
special
connexions
of
vocal
and
auditory
nervous
filaments
which
are
met
with
in
the
human
brain
and
has
it
not
been
said
that
to
hear
is
to
speak
to
oneself
some
neuropaths
can
not
be
present
at
a
conversation
without
moving
their
lips
this
is
only
an
exaggeration
of
what
takes
place
in
the
case
of
every
one
of
us
how
will
the
expressive
or
rather
suggestive
power
of
music
be
explained
if
not
by
admitting
that
we
repeat
to
ourselves
the
sounds
heard
so
as
to
carry
ourselves
back
into
the
psychic
state
out
of
which
they
emerged
an
original
state
which
nothing
will
express
but
which
something
may
suggest
the
very
motion
and
attitude
which
the
sound
imparts
to
our
body
sidenote
intensity
and
pitch
the
part
played
by
muscular
effort
thus
when
we
speak
of
the
intensity
of
a
sound
of
medium
force
as
a
magnitude
we
allude
principally
to
the
greater
or
less
effort
which
we
should
have
ourselves
to
expend
in
order
to
summon
by
our
own
effort
the
same
auditory
sensation
now
besides
the
intensity
we
distinguish
another
characteristic
property
of
the
sound
its
pitch
are
the
differences
in
pitch
such
as
our
ear
perceives
quantitative
differences
i
grant
that
a
sharper
sound
calls
up
the
picture
of
a
higher
position
in
space
but
does
it
follow
from
this
that
the
notes
of
the
scale
as
auditory
sensations
differ
otherwise
than
in
quality
forget
what
you
have
learnt
from
physics
examine
carefully
your
idea
of
a
higher
or
lower
note
and
see
whether
you
do
not
think
simply
of
the
greater
or
less
effort
which
the
tensor
muscle
of
your
vocal
chords
has
to
make
in
order
to
produce
the
note
as
the
effort
by
which
your
voice
passes
from
one
note
to
another
is
discontinuous
you
picture
to
yourself
these
successive
notes
as
points
in
space
to
be
reached
by
a
series
of
sudden
jumps
in
each
of
which
you
cross
an
empty
separating
interval
this
is
why
you
establish
intervals
between
the
notes
of
the
scale
now
why
is
the
line
along
which
we
dispose
them
vertical
rather
than
horizontal
and
why
do
we
say
that
the
sound
ascends
in
some
cases
and
descends
in
others
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
high
notes
seem
to
us
to
produce
some
sort
of
resonance
in
the
head
and
the
deep
notes
in
the
thorax
this
perception
whether
real
or
illusory
has
undoubtedly
had
some
effect
in
making
us
reckon
the
intervals
vertically
but
we
must
also
notice
that
the
greater
the
tension
of
the
vocal
chords
in
the
chest
voice
the
greater
is
the
surface
of
the
body
affected
if
the
singer
is
inexperienced
this
is
just
the
reason
why
the
effort
is
felt
by
him
as
more
intense
and
as
he
breathes
out
the
air
upwards
he
will
attribute
the
same
direction
to
the
sound
produced
by
the
current
of
air
hence
the
sympathy
of
a
larger
part
of
the
body
with
the
vocal
muscles
will
be
represented
by
a
movement
upwards
we
shall
thus
say
that
the
note
is
higher
because
the
body
makes
an
effort
as
though
to
reach
an
object
which
is
more
elevated
in
space
in
this
way
it
became
customary
to
assign
a
certain
height
to
each
note
of
the
scale
and
as
soon
as
the
physicist
was
able
to
define
it
by
the
number
of
vibrations
in
a
given
time
to
which
it
corresponds
we
no
longer
hesitated
to
declare
that
our
ear
perceived
differences
of
quantity
directly
but
the
sound
would
remain
a
pure
quality
if
we
did
not
bring
in
the
muscular
effort
which
produces
it
or
the
vibrations
which
explain
it
sidenote
the
sensations
of
heat
and
cold
these
soon
become
affective
and
are
measured
by
reactions
called
forth
the
experiments
of
blix
goldscheider
and
donaldson
have
shown
that
the
points
on
the
surface
of
the
body
which
feel
cold
are
not
the
same
as
those
which
feel
heat
physiology
is
thus
disposed
to
set
up
a
distinction
of
nature
and
not
merely
of
degree
between
the
sensations
of
heat
and
cold
but
psychological
observation
goes
further
for
close
attention
can
easily
discover
specific
differences
between
the
different
sensations
of
heat
as
also
between
the
sensations
of
cold
a
more
intense
heat
is
really
another
kind
of
heat
we
call
it
more
intense
because
we
have
experienced
this
same
change
a
thousand
times
when
we
approached
nearer
and
nearer
a
source
of
heat
or
when
a
growing
surface
of
our
body
was
affected
by
it
besides
the
sensations
of
heat
and
cold
very
quickly
become
affective
and
incite
us
to
more
or
less
marked
reactions
by
which
we
measure
their
external
cause
hence
we
are
inclined
to
set
up
similar
quantitative
differences
among
the
sensations
which
correspond
to
lower
intensities
of
the
cause
but
i
shall
not
insist
any
further
every
one
must
question
himself
carefully
on
this
point
after
making
a
clean
sweep
of
everything
which
his
past
experience
has
taught
him
about
the
cause
of
his
sensations
and
coming
face
to
face
with
the
sensations
themselves
the
result
of
this
examination
is
likely
to
be
as
follows
it
will
be
perceived
that
the
magnitude
of
a
representative
sensation
depends
on
the
cause
having
been
put
into
the
effect
while
the
intensity
of
the
affective
element
depends
on
the
more
or
less
important
reactions
which
prolong
the
external
stimulations
and
find
their
way
into
the
sensation
itself
sidenote
the
sensation
of
pressure
and
weight
measured
by
extent
of
organism
affected
the
same
thing
will
be
experienced
in
the
case
of
pressure
and
even
weight
when
you
say
that
a
pressure
on
your
hand
becomes
stronger
see
whether
you
do
not
mean
that
there
first
was
a
contact
then
a
pressure
afterwards
a
pain
and
that
this
pain
itself
after
having
gone
through
a
series
of
qualitative
changes
has
spread
further
and
further
over
the
surrounding
region
look
again
and
see
whether
you
do
not
bring
in
the
more
and
more
intense
more
and
more
extended
effort
of
resistance
which
you
oppose
to
the
external
pressure
when
the
psychophysicist
lifts
a
heavier
weight
he
experiences
he
says
an
increase
of
sensation
examine
whether
this
increase
of
sensation
ought
not
rather
to
be
called
a
sensation
of
increase
the
whole
question
is
centred
in
this
for
in
the
first
case
the
sensation
would
be
a
quantity
like
its
external
cause
whilst
in
the
second
it
would
be
a
quality
which
had
become
representative
of
the
magnitude
of
its
cause
the
distinction
between
the
heavy
and
the
light
may
seem
to
be
as
and
as
childish
as
that
between
the
hot
and
the
cold
but
the
very
childishness
of
this
distinction
makes
it
a
psychological
reality
and
not
only
do
the
heavy
and
the
light
impress
our
consciousness
as
generically
different
but
the
various
degrees
of
lightness
and
heaviness
are
so
many
species
of
these
two
genera
it
must
be
added
that
the
difference
of
quality
is
here
translated
spontaneously
into
a
difference
of
quantity
because
of
the
more
or
less
extended
effort
which
our
body
makes
in
order
to
lift
a
given
weight
of
this
you
will
soon
become
aware
if
you
are
asked
to
lift
a
basket
which
you
are
told
is
full
of
whilst
in
fact
there
is
nothing
in
it
you
will
think
you
are
losing
your
balance
when
you
catch
hold
of
it
as
though
distant
muscles
had
interested
themselves
beforehand
in
the
operation
and
experienced
a
sudden
disappointment
it
is
chiefly
by
the
number
and
nature
of
these
sympathetic
efforts
which
take
place
at
different
points
of
the
organism
that
you
measure
the
sensation
of
weight
at
a
given
point
and
this
sensation
would
be
nothing
more
than
a
quality
if
you
did
not
thus
introduce
into
it
the
idea
of
a
magnitude
what
strengthens
the
illusion
on
this
point
is
that
we
have
become
accustomed
to
believe
in
the
immediate
perception
of
a
homogeneous
movement
in
a
homogeneous
space
when
i
lift
a
light
weight
with
my
arm
all
the
rest
of
my
body
remaining
motionless
i
experience
a
series
of
muscular
sensations
each
of
which
has
its
local
sign
its
peculiar
shade
it
is
this
series
which
my
consciousness
interprets
as
a
continuous
movement
in
space
if
i
afterwards
lift
a
heavier
weight
to
the
same
height
with
the
same
speed
i
pass
through
a
new
series
of
muscular
sensations
each
of
which
differs
from
the
corresponding
term
of
the
preceding
series
of
this
i
could
easily
convince
myself
by
examining
them
closely
but
as
i
interpret
this
new
series
also
as
a
continuous
movement
and
as
this
movement
has
the
same
direction
the
same
duration
and
the
same
velocity
as
the
preceding
my
consciousness
feels
itself
bound
to
localize
the
difference
between
the
second
series
of
sensations
and
the
first
elsewhere
than
in
the
movement
itself
it
thus
materializes
this
difference
at
the
extremity
of
the
arm
which
moves
it
persuades
itself
that
the
sensation
of
movement
has
been
identical
in
both
cases
while
the
sensation
of
weight
differed
in
magnitude
but
movement
and
weight
are
but
distinctions
of
the
reflective
consciousness
what
is
present
to
consciousness
immediately
is
the
sensation
of
so
to
speak
a
heavy
movement
and
this
sensation
itself
can
be
resolved
by
analysis
into
a
series
of
muscular
sensations
each
of
which
represents
by
its
shade
its
place
of
origin
and
by
its
colour
the
magnitude
of
the
weight
lifted
sidenote
the
sensation
of
light
qualitative
changes
of
colour
interpreted
as
quantitative
changes
in
intensity
of
luminous
source
shall
we
call
the
intensity
of
light
a
quantity
or
shall
we
treat
it
as
a
quality
it
has
not
perhaps
been
sufficiently
noticed
what
a
large
number
of
different
factors
in
daily
life
in
giving
us
information
about
the
nature
of
the
luminous
source
we
know
from
long
experience
that
when
we
have
a
difficulty
in
distinguishing
the
outlines
and
details
of
objects
the
light
is
at
a
distance
or
on
the
point
of
going
out
experience
has
taught
us
that
the
affective
sensation
or
nascent
dazzling
that
we
experience
in
certain
cases
must
be
attributed
to
a
higher
intensity
of
the
cause
any
increase
or
diminution
in
the
number
of
luminous
sources
alters
the
way
in
which
the
sharp
lines
of
bodies
stand
out
and
also
the
shadows
which
they
project
still
more
important
are
the
changes
of
hue
which
coloured
surfaces
and
even
the
pure
colours
of
the
spectrum
undergo
under
the
influence
of
a
brighter
or
dimmer
light
as
the
luminous
source
is
brought
nearer
violet
takes
a
bluish
tinge
green
tends
to
become
a
whitish
yellow
and
red
a
brilliant
yellow
inversely
when
the
light
is
moved
away
ultramarine
passes
into
violet
and
yellow
into
green
finally
red
green
and
violet
tend
to
become
a
whitish
yellow
physicists
have
remarked
these
changes
of
hue
for
some
time
but
what
is
still
more
remarkable
is
that
the
majority
of
men
do
not
perceive
them
unless
they
pay
attention
to
them
or
are
warned
of
them
having
made
up
our
mind
once
for
all
to
interpret
changes
of
quality
as
changes
of
quantity
we
begin
by
asserting
that
every
object
has
its
own
peculiar
colour
definite
and
invariable
and
when
the
hue
of
objects
tends
to
become
yellow
or
blue
instead
of
saying
that
we
see
their
colour
change
under
the
influence
of
an
increase
or
diminution
of
light
we
assert
that
the
colour
remains
the
same
but
that
our
sensation
of
luminous
intensity
increases
or
diminishes
we
thus
substitute
once
more
for
the
qualitative
impression
received
by
our
consciousness
the
quantitative
interpretation
given
by
our
understanding
helmholtz
has
described
a
case
of
interpretation
of
the
same
kind
but
still
more
complicated
if
we
form
white
with
two
colours
of
the
spectrum
and
if
we
increase
or
diminish
the
intensities
of
the
two
coloured
lights
in
the
same
ratio
so
that
the
proportions
of
the
combination
remain
the
same
the
resultant
colour
remains
the
same
although
the
relative
intensity
of
the
sensations
undergoes
a
marked
change
this
depends
on
the
fact
that
the
light
of
the
sun
which
we
consider
as
the
normal
white
light
during
the
day
itself
undergoes
similar
modifications
of
shade
when
the
luminous
intensity
varies
sidenote
does
experiment
prove
that
we
can
measure
directly
our
sensations
of
light
but
yet
if
we
often
judge
of
variations
in
the
luminous
source
by
the
relative
changes
of
hue
of
the
objects
which
surround
us
this
is
no
longer
the
case
in
simple
instances
where
a
single
object
a
white
surface
passes
successively
through
different
degrees
of
luminosity
we
are
bound
to
insist
particularly
on
this
last
point
for
the
physicist
speaks
of
degrees
of
luminous
intensity
as
of
real
quantities
and
in
fact
he
measures
them
by
the
photometer
the
psychophysicist
goes
still
further
he
maintains
that
our
eye
itself
estimates
the
intensities
of
light
experiments
have
been
attempted
at
first
by
delbœuf
and
afterwards
by
lehmann
and
neiglick
with
the
view
of
constructing
a
psychophysical
formula
from
the
direct
measurement
of
our
luminous
sensations
of
these
experiments
we
shall
not
dispute
the
result
nor
shall
we
deny
the
value
of
photometric
processes
but
we
must
see
how
we
have
to
interpret
them
sidenote
photometric
experiments
we
perceive
different
shades
and
afterwards
interpret
them
as
decreasing
intensities
of
white
light
look
closely
at
a
sheet
of
paper
lighted
by
four
candles
and
put
out
in
succession
one
two
photometric
three
of
them
you
say
that
the
surface
remains
white
and
that
its
brightness
diminishes
but
you
are
aware
that
one
candle
has
just
been
put
out
or
if
you
do
not
know
it
you
have
often
observed
a
similar
change
in
the
appearance
of
a
white
surface
when
the
illumination
was
diminished
put
aside
what
you
remember
of
your
past
experiences
and
what
you
are
accustomed
to
say
of
the
present
ones
you
will
find
that
what
you
really
perceive
is
not
a
diminished
illumination
of
the
white
surface
it
is
a
of
passing
over
this
surface
at
the
moment
the
candle
is
extinguished
this
shadow
is
a
reality
to
your
consciousness
like
the
light
itself
if
you
call
the
first
surface
in
all
its
brilliancy
white
you
will
have
to
give
another
name
to
what
you
now
see
for
it
is
a
different
thing
it
is
if
we
may
say
so
a
new
shade
of
white
we
have
grown
accustomed
through
the
combined
influence
of
our
past
experience
and
of
physical
theories
to
regard
black
as
the
absence
or
at
least
as
the
minimum
of
luminous
sensation
and
the
successive
shades
of
grey
as
decreasing
intensities
of
white
light
but
in
point
of
fact
black
has
just
as
much
reality
for
our
consciousness
as
white
and
the
decreasing
intensities
of
white
light
illuminating
a
given
surface
would
appear
to
an
unprejudiced
consciousness
as
so
many
different
shades
not
unlike
the
various
colours
of
the
spectrum
this
is
the
reason
why
the
change
in
the
sensation
is
not
continuous
as
it
is
in
the
external
cause
and
why
the
light
can
increase
or
decrease
for
a
certain
period
without
producing
any
apparent
change
in
the
illumination
of
our
white
surface
the
illumination
will
not
appear
to
change
until
the
increase
or
decrease
of
the
external
light
is
sufficient
to
produce
a
new
quality
the
variations
in
brightness
of
a
given
colour
the
affective
sensations
of
which
we
have
spoken
above
being
left
aside
would
thus
be
nothing
but
qualitative
changes
were
it
not
our
custom
to
transfer
the
cause
to
the
effect
and
to
replace
our
immediate
impressions
by
what
we
learn
from
experience
and
science
the
same
thing
might
be
said
of
degrees
of
saturation
indeed
if
the
different
intensities
of
a
colour
correspond
to
so
many
different
shades
existing
between
this
colour
and
black
the
degrees
of
saturation
are
like
shades
intermediate
between
this
same
colour
and
pure
white
every
colour
we
might
say
can
be
regarded
under
two
aspects
from
the
point
of
view
of
black
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
white
and
black
is
then
to
intensity
what
white
is
to
saturation
sidenote
in
photometric
experiments
the
physicist
compares
not
sensations
but
physical
effects
the
meaning
of
the
photometric
experiments
will
now
be
understood
a
candle
placed
at
a
certain
distance
from
a
sheet
of
paper
illuminates
it
in
a
certain
way
you
double
the
distance
and
find
that
four
candles
are
required
to
produce
the
same
effects
sensation
from
this
you
conclude
that
if
you
had
doubled
the
distance
without
increasing
the
intensity
of
the
luminous
source
the
resultant
illumination
would
have
been
only
as
bright
but
it
is
quite
obvious
that
you
are
here
dealing
with
the
physical
and
not
the
psychological
effect
for
it
can
not
be
said
that
you
have
compared
two
sensations
with
one
another
you
have
made
use
of
a
single
sensation
in
order
to
compare
two
different
luminous
sources
with
each
other
the
second
four
times
as
strong
as
the
first
but
twice
as
far
off
in
a
word
the
physicist
never
brings
in
sensations
which
are
twice
or
three
times
as
great
as
others
but
only
identical
sensations
destined
to
serve
as
intermediaries
between
two
physical
quantities
which
can
then
be
equated
with
one
another
the
sensation
of
light
here
plays
the
part
of
the
auxiliary
unknown
quantity
which
the
mathematician
introduces
into
his
calculations
and
which
is
not
intended
to
appear
in
the
final
result
sidenote
the
psychophysicist
claims
to
compare
and
measure
sensations
delbœuf
experiments
but
the
object
of
the
psychophysicist
is
entirely
different
it
is
the
sensation
of
light
itself
which
he
studies
and
claims
to
measure
sometimes
he
will
proceed
to
integrate
infinitely
small
differences
after
the
method
of
fechner
sometimes
he
will
compare
one
sensation
directly
with
another
the
latter
method
due
to
plateau
and
delbœuf
differs
far
less
than
has
hitherto
been
believed
from
fechner
but
as
it
bears
more
especially
on
the
luminous
sensations
we
shall
deal
with
it
first
delbœuf
places
an
observer
in
front
of
three
concentric
rings
which
vary
in
brightness
by
an
ingenious
arrangement
he
can
cause
each
of
these
rings
to
pass
through
all
the
shades
intermediate
between
white
and
black
let
us
suppose
that
two
hues
of
grey
are
simultaneously
produced
on
two
of
the
rings
and
kept
unchanged
let
us
call
them
a
and
delbœuf
alters
the
brightness
c
of
the
third
ring
and
asks
the
observer
to
tell
him
whether
at
a
certain
moment
the
grey
b
appears
to
him
equally
distant
from
the
other
two
a
moment
comes
in
fact
when
the
observer
states
that
the
contrast
a
b
is
equal
to
the
contrast
b
c
so
that
according
to
delbœuf
a
scale
of
luminous
intensities
could
be
constructed
on
which
we
might
pass
from
each
sensation
to
the
following
one
by
equal
sensible
contrasts
our
sensations
would
thus
be
measured
by
one
another
i
shall
not
follow
delbœuf
into
the
conclusions
which
he
has
drawn
from
these
remarkable
experiments
the
essential
question
the
only
question
as
it
seems
to
me
is
whether
a
contrast
a
b
formed
of
the
elements
a
and
b
is
really
equal
to
a
contrast
b
c
which
is
differently
composed
as
soon
as
it
is
proved
that
two
sensations
can
be
equal
without
being
identical
psychophysics
will
be
established
but
it
is
this
equality
which
seems
to
me
open
to
question
it
is
easy
to
explain
in
fact
how
a
sensation
of
luminous
intensity
can
be
said
to
be
at
an
equal
distance
from
two
others
sidenote
in
what
cases
differences
of
colour
might
be
interpreted
as
differences
of
magnitude
let
us
assume
for
a
moment
that
from
our
birth
onwards
the
growing
intensity
of
a
luminous
source
had
always
called
up
in
our
consciousness
one
after
the
other
the
different
colours
of
the
spectrum
there
is
no
doubt
that
these
colours
would
then
appear
to
us
as
so
many
notes
of
a
gamut
as
higher
or
lower
degrees
in
a
scale
in
a
word
as
magnitudes
moreover
it
would
be
easy
for
us
to
assign
each
of
them
its
place
in
the
series
for
although
the
extensive
cause
varies
continuously
the
changes
in
the
sensation
of
colour
are
discontinuous
passing
from
one
shade
to
another
shade
however
numerous
then
may
be
the
shades
intermediate
between
the
two
colours
a
and
b
it
will
always
be
possible
to
count
them
in
thought
at
least
roughly
and
ascertain
whether
this
number
is
almost
equal
to
that
of
the
shades
which
separate
b
from
another
colour
in
the
latter
case
it
will
be
said
that
b
is
equally
distant
from
a
and
c
that
the
contrast
is
the
same
on
one
side
as
on
the
other
but
this
will
always
be
merely
a
convenient
interpretation
for
although
the
number
of
intermediate
shades
may
be
equal
on
both
sides
although
we
may
pass
from
one
to
the
other
by
sudden
leaps
we
do
not
know
whether
these
leaps
are
magnitudes
still
less
whether
they
are
magnitudes
above
all
it
would
be
necessary
to
show
that
the
intermediaries
which
have
helped
us
throughout
our
measurement
could
be
found
again
inside
the
object
which
we
have
measured
if
not
it
is
only
by
a
metaphor
that
a
sensation
can
be
said
to
be
an
equal
distance
from
two
others
sidenote
this
is
just
the
case
with
differences
of
intensity
in
sensations
of
light
delbœuf
underlying
postulate
now
if
the
views
which
we
have
before
enumerated
with
regard
to
luminous
intensities
are
accepted
it
will
be
recognized
that
the
different
hues
of
grey
which
delbœuf
displays
to
us
are
strictly
analogous
for
our
consciousness
to
colours
and
that
if
we
declare
that
a
grey
tint
is
equidistant
from
two
other
grey
tints
it
is
in
the
same
sense
in
which
it
might
be
said
that
orange
for
example
is
at
an
equal
distance
from
green
and
red
but
there
is
this
difference
that
in
all
our
past
experience
the
succession
of
grey
tints
has
been
produced
in
connexion
with
a
progressive
increase
or
decrease
in
illumination
hence
we
do
for
the
differences
of
brightness
what
we
do
not
think
of
doing
for
the
differences
of
colour
we
promote
the
changes
of
quality
into
variations
of
magnitude
indeed
there
is
no
difficulty
here
about
the
measuring
because
the
successive
shades
of
grey
produced
by
a
continuous
decrease
of
illumination
are
discontinuous
as
being
qualities
and
because
we
can
count
approximately
the
principal
intermediate
shades
which
separate
any
two
kinds
of
grey
the
contrast
a
b
will
thus
be
declared
equal
to
the
contrast
b
c
when
our
imagination
aided
by
our
memory
inserts
between
a
and
b
the
same
number
of
intermediate
shades
as
between
b
and
it
is
needless
to
say
that
this
will
necessarily
be
a
very
rough
estimate
we
may
anticipate
that
it
will
vary
considerably
with
different
persons
above
all
it
is
to
be
expected
that
the
person
will
show
more
hesitation
and
that
the
estimates
of
different
persons
will
differ
more
widely
in
proportion
as
the
difference
in
brightness
between
the
rings
a
and
b
is
increased
for
a
more
and
more
laborious
effort
will
be
required
to
estimate
the
number
of
intermediate
hues
this
is
exactly
what
happens
as
we
shall
easily
perceive
by
glancing
at
the
two
tables
drawn
up
by
delbœuf
in
proportion
as
he
increases
the
difference
in
brightness
between
the
exterior
ring
and
the
middle
ring
the
difference
between
the
numbers
on
which
one
and
the
same
observer
or
different
observers
successively
fix
increases
almost
continuously
from
degrees
to
from
to
from
to
from
to
but
let
us
leave
these
divergences
on
one
side
let
us
assume
that
the
observers
are
always
consistent
and
always
agree
with
one
another
will
it
then
be
established
that
the
contrasts
a
b
and
b
c
are
equal
it
would
first
be
necessary
to
prove
that
two
successive
elementary
contrasts
are
equal
quantities
whilst
in
fact
we
only
know
that
they
are
successive
it
would
then
be
necessary
to
prove
that
inside
a
given
tint
of
grey
we
perceive
the
less
intense
shades
which
our
imagination
has
run
through
in
order
to
estimate
the
objective
intensity
of
the
source
of
light
in
a
word
delbœuf
psychophysics
assumes
a
theoretical
postulate
of
the
greatest
importance
which
is
disguised
under
the
cloak
of
an
experimental
result
and
which
we
should
formulate
as
follows
when
the
objective
quantity
of
light
is
continuously
increased
the
differences
between
the
hues
of
grey
successively
obtained
each
of
which
represents
the
smallest
perceptible
increase
of
physical
stimulation
are
quantities
equal
to
one
another
and
besides
any
one
of
the
sensations
obtained
can
be
equated
with
the
sum
of
the
differences
which
separate
from
one
another
all
previous
sensations
going
from
zero
upwards
now
this
is
just
the
postulate
of
fechner
psychophysics
which
we
are
going
to
examine
sidenote
fechner
psychophysics
weber
law
fechner
took
as
his
a
law
discovered
by
weber
according
to
which
given
a
certain
stimulus
which
calls
forth
a
certain
sensation
the
amount
by
which
the
stimulus
must
be
increased
for
consciousness
to
become
aware
of
any
change
bears
a
fixed
relation
to
the
original
stimulus
thus
if
we
denote
by
ε
the
stimulus
which
corresponds
to
the
sensation
s
and
by
δε
the
amount
by
which
the
original
stimulus
must
be
increased
in
order
that
a
sensation
of
difference
may
be
produced
we
shall
have
const
this
formula
has
been
much
modified
by
the
disciples
of
fechner
and
we
prefer
to
take
no
part
in
the
discussion
it
is
for
experiment
to
decide
between
the
relation
established
by
weber
and
its
substitutes
nor
shall
we
raise
any
difficulty
about
granting
the
probable
existence
of
a
law
of
this
nature
it
is
here
really
a
question
not
of
measuring
a
sensation
but
only
of
determining
the
exact
moment
at
which
an
increase
of
stimulus
produces
a
change
in
it
now
if
a
definite
amount
of
stimulus
produces
a
definite
shade
of
sensation
it
is
obvious
that
the
minimum
amount
of
stimulus
required
to
produce
a
change
in
this
shade
is
also
definite
and
since
it
is
not
constant
it
must
be
a
function
of
the
original
stimulus
but
how
are
we
to
pass
from
a
relation
between
the
stimulus
and
its
minimum
increase
to
an
equation
which
connects
the
amount
of
sensation
with
the
corresponding
stimulus
the
whole
of
psychophysics
is
involved
in
this
transition
which
is
therefore
worthy
of
our
closest
consideration
sidenote
the
underlying
assumptions
and
the
process
by
which
fechner
law
is
reached
we
shall
distinguish
several
different
artifices
in
the
process
of
transition
from
weber
experiments
or
from
any
other
series
of
similar
observations
to
a
psychophysical
law
like
fechner
it
is
first
of
all
agreed
to
consider
our
consciousness
of
an
increase
of
stimulus
as
an
increase
of
the
sensation
s
this
is
therefore
called
it
is
then
asserted
that
all
the
sensations
δs
which
correspond
to
the
smallest
perceptible
increase
of
stimulus
are
equal
to
one
another
they
are
therefore
treated
as
quantities
and
while
on
the
one
hand
these
quantities
are
supposed
to
be
always
equal

equation

a

c

we
shall
now
simply
have
to
integrate

both
sides

obtain
the
desired
relation

and
the
transition
will
thus
be
made
from
a
proved
law
which
only
concerned
the
of
a
sensation
to
an
unprovable
law
which
gives
its
without
entering
upon
any
thorough
discussion
of
this
ingenious
operation
let
us
show
in
a
few
words
how
fechner
has
grasped
the
real
difficulty
of
the
problem
how
he
has
tried
to
overcome
it
and
where
as
it
seems
to
us
the
flaw
in
his
reasoning
lies
sidenote
can
two
sensations
be
equal
without
being
identical
fechner
realized
that
measurement
could
not
be
introduced
into
psychology
without
first
defining
what
is
meant
by
the
equality
and
addition
of
two
simple
states
two
sensations
but
unless
they
are
identical
we
do
not
at
first
see
how
two
sensations
can
be
equal
undoubtedly
in
the
physical
world
equality
is
not
synonymous
with
identity
but
the
reason
is
that
every
phenomenon
every
object
is
there
presented
under
two
aspects
the
one
qualitative
and
the
other
extensive
nothing
prevents
us
from
putting
the
first
one
aside
and
then
there
remains
nothing
but
terms
which
can
be
directly
or
indirectly
superposed
on
one
another
and
consequently
seen
to
be
identical
now
this
qualitative
element
which
we
begin
by
eliminating
from
external
objects
in
order
to
measure
them
is
the
very
thing
which
psychophysics
retains
and
claims
to
measure
and
it
is
no
use
trying
to
measure
this
quality
q
by
some
physical
quantity
q
which
lies
beneath
it
for
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
previously
shown
that
q
is
a
function
of
q
and
this
would
not
be
possible
unless
the
quality
q
had
first
been
measured
with
some
fraction
of
itself
thus
nothing
prevents
us
from
measuring
the
sensation
of
heat
by
the
degree
of
temperature
but
this
is
only
a
convention
and
the
whole
point
of
psychophysics
lies
in
rejecting
this
convention
and
seeking
how
the
sensation
of
heat
varies
when
you
change
the
temperature
in
a
word
it
seems
on
the
one
hand
that
two
different
sensations
can
not
be
said
to
be
equal
unless
some
identical
residuum
remains
after
the
elimination
of
their
qualitative
difference
but
on
the
other
hand
this
qualitative
difference
being
all
that
we
perceive
it
does
not
appear
what
could
remain
once
it
was
eliminated
sidenote
fechner
method
of
differences
the
novel
feature
in
fechner
treatment
is
that
he
did
not
consider
this
difficulty
insurmountable
taking
advantage
of
the
fact
that
sensation
varies
by
sudden
jumps
while
the
stimulus
increases
continuously
he
did
not
hesitate
to
call
these
differences
of
sensation
by
the
same
name
they
are
all
he
says
differences
since
each
corresponds
to
the
smallest
perceptible
increase
in
the
external
stimulus
therefore
you
can
set
aside
the
specific
shade
or
quality
of
these
successive
differences
a
common
residuum
will
remain
in
virtue
of
which
they
will
be
seen
to
be
in
a
manner
identical
they
all
have
the
common
character
of
being
such
will
be
the
definition
of
equality
which
we
were
seeking
now
the
definition
of
addition
will
follow
naturally
for
if
we
treat
as
a
quantity
the
difference
perceived
by
consciousness
between
two
sensations
which
succeed
one
another
in
the
course
of
a
continuous
increase
of
stimulus
if
we
call
the
first
sensation
s
and
the
second
s
δs
we
shall
have
to
consider
every
sensation
s
as
a
sum
obtained
by
the
addition
of
the
minimum
differences
through
which
we
pass
before
reaching
it
the
only
remaining
step
will
then
be
to
utilize
this
twofold
definition
in
order
to
establish
first
of
all
a
relation
between
the
differences
δs
and
δε
and
then
through
the
substitution
of
the
differentials
between
the
two
variables
true
the
mathematicians
may
here
lodge
a
protest
against
the
substitution
of
differential
for
difference
the
psychologists
may
ask
too
whether
the
quantity
δs
instead
of
being
constant
does
not
vary
as
the
sensation
s
itself
finally
taking
the
psychophysical
law
for
granted
we
may
all
debate
about
its
real
meaning
but
by
the
mere
fact
that
δs
is
regarded
as
a
quantity
and
s
as
a
sum
the
fundamental
postulate
of
the
whole
process
is
accepted
sidenote
of
the
assumption
that
the
sensation
is
a
sum
and
the
minimum
differences
quantities
now
it
is
just
this
postulate
which
seems
to
us
open
to
question
even
if
it
can
be
understood
assume
that
i
experience
a
sensation
s
and
that
increasing
the
stimulus
continuously
i
perceive
this
increase
after
a
certain
time
i
am
now
notified
of
the
increase
of
the
cause
but
why
should
i
call
this
notification
an
arithmetical
difference
no
doubt
the
notification
consists
in
the
fact
that
the
original
state
s
has
changed
it
has
become
s
but
the
transition
from
s
to
s
could
only
be
called
an
arithmetical
difference
if
i
were
conscious
so
to
speak
of
an
interval
between
s
and
s
and
if
my
sensation
were
felt
to
rise
from
s
to
s
by
the
addition
of
something
by
giving
this
transition
a
name
by
calling
it
δs
you
make
it
first
a
reality
and
then
a
quantity
now
not
only
are
you
unable
to
explain
in
what
sense
this
transition
is
a
quantity
but
reflection
will
show
you
that
it
is
not
even
a
reality
the
only
realities
are
the
states
s
and
s
through
which
i
pass
no
doubt
if
s
and
s
were
numbers
i
could
assert
the
reality
of
the
difference
s
s
even
though
s
and
s
alone
were
given
the
reason
is
that
the
number
s
s
which
is
a
certain
sum
of
units
will
then
represent
just
the
successive
moments
of
the
addition
by
which
we
pass
from
s
to
s
but
if
s
and
s
are
simple
states
in
what
will
the
which
separates
them
consist
and
what
then
can
the
transition
from
the
first
state
to
the
second
be
if
not
a
mere
act
of
your
thought
which
arbitrarily
and
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
assimilates
a
succession
of
two
states
to
a
differentiation
of
two
magnitudes
sidenote
we
can
speak
of
arithmetical
difference
only
in
a
conventional
sense
either
you
keep
to
what
consciousness
presents
to
you
or
you
have
recourse
to
a
conventional
mode
of
representation
in
the
first
case
you
will
find
a
difference
between
s
and
s
like
that
between
the
shades
sense
of
rainbow
and
not
at
all
an
interval
of
magnitude
in
the
second
case
you
may
introduce
the
symbol
δs
if
you
like
but
it
is
only
in
a
conventional
sense
that
you
will
speak
here
of
an
arithmetical
difference
and
in
a
conventional
sense
also
that
you
will
assimilate
a
sensation
to
a
sum
the
most
acute
of
critics
jules
tannery
has
made
the
latter
point
perfectly
clear
it
will
be
said
for
example
that
a
sensation
of
degrees
is
expressed
by
the
number
of
differential
sensations
which
would
succeed
one
another
from
the
point
where
sensation
is
absent
up
to
the
sensation
of
degrees
i
do
not
see
that
this
is
anything
but
a
definition
which
is
as
legitimate
as
it
is
arbitrary
sidenote
delbœuf
results
seem
more
plausible
but
in
the
end
all
psychophysics
revolves
in
a
vicious
circle
we
do
not
believe
in
spite
of
all
that
has
been
said
that
the
method
of
mean
gradations
has
set
psychophysics
on
a
new
path
the
novel
feature
in
delbœuf
investigation
was
that
he
chose
a
particular
case
in
which
consciousness
seemed
to
decide
in
fechner
favour
and
in
which
common
sense
itself
played
the
part
of
the
psychophysicist
he
inquired
whether
certain
sensations
did
not
appear
to
us
immediately
as
equal
although
different
and
whether
it
would
not
be
possible
to
draw
up
by
their
help
a
table
of
sensations
which
were
double
triple
or
quadruple
those
which
preceded
them
the
mistake
which
fechner
made
as
we
have
just
seen
was
that
he
believed
in
an
interval
between
two
successive
sensations
s
and
s
when
there
is
simply
a
from
one
to
the
other
and
not
a
in
the
arithmetical
sense
of
the
word
but
if
the
two
terms
between
which
the
passing
takes
place
could
be
given
simultaneously
there
would
then
be
a
contrast
besides
the
transition
and
although
the
contrast
is
not
yet
an
arithmetical
difference
it
resembles
it
in
a
certain
respect
for
the
two
terms
which
are
compared
stand
here
side
by
side
as
in
a
case
of
subtraction
of
two
numbers
suppose
now
that
these
sensations
belong
to
the
same
and
that
in
our
past
experience
we
have
constantly
been
present
at
their
march
past
so
to
speak
while
the
physical
stimulus
increased
continuously
it
is
extremely
probable
that
we
shall
thrust
the
cause
into
the
effect
and
that
the
idea
of
contrast
will
thus
melt
into
that
of
arithmetical
difference
as
we
shall
have
noticed
moreover
that
the
sensation
changed
abruptly
while
the
stimulus
rose
continuously
we
shall
no
doubt
estimate
the
distance
between
two
given
sensations
by
a
rough
guess
at
the
number
of
these
sudden
jumps
or
at
least
of
the
intermediate
sensations
which
usually
serve
us
as
landmarks
to
sum
up
the
contrast
will
appear
to
us
as
a
difference
the
stimulus
as
a
quantity
the
sudden
jump
as
an
element
of
equality
combining
these
three
factors
we
shall
reach
the
idea
of
equal
quantitative
differences
now
these
conditions
are
nowhere
so
well
realized
as
when
surfaces
of
the
same
colour
more
or
less
illuminated
are
simultaneously
presented
to
us
not
only
is
there
here
a
contrast
between
similar
sensations
but
these
sensations
correspond
to
a
cause
whose
influence
has
always
been
felt
by
us
to
be
closely
connected
with
its
distance
and
as
this
distance
can
vary
continuously
we
can
not
have
escaped
noticing
in
our
past
experience
a
vast
number
of
shades
of
sensation
which
succeeded
one
another
along
with
the
continuous
increase
in
the
cause
we
are
therefore
able
to
say
that
the
contrast
between
one
shade
of
grey
and
another
for
example
seems
to
us
almost
equal
to
the
contrast
between
the
latter
and
a
third
one
and
if
we
define
two
equal
sensations
by
saying
that
they
are
sensations
which
a
more
or
less
confused
process
of
reasoning
interprets
as
such
we
shall
in
fact
reach
a
law
like
that
proposed
by
delbœuf
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
consciousness
has
here
passed
through
the
same
intermediate
steps
as
the
psychophysicist
and
that
its
judgment
is
worth
here
just
what
psychophysics
is
worth
it
is
a
symbolical
interpretation
of
quality
as
quantity
a
more
or
less
rough
estimate
of
the
number
of
sensations
which
can
come
in
between
two
given
sensations
the
difference
is
thus
not
as
great
as
is
believed
between
the
method
of
least
noticeable
differences
and
that
of
mean
gradations
between
the
psychophysics
of
fechner
and
that
of
delbœuf
the
first
led
to
a
conventional
measurement
of
sensation
the
second
appeals
to
common
sense
in
the
particular
cases
where
common
sense
adopts
a
similar
convention
in
a
word
all
psychophysics
is
condemned
by
its
origin
to
revolve
in
a
vicious
circle
for
the
theoretical
postulate
on
which
it
rests
condemns
it
to
experimental
verification
and
it
can
not
be
experimentally
verified
unless
its
postulate
is
first
granted
the
fact
is
that
there
is
no
point
of
contact
between
the
unextended
and
the
extended
between
quality
and
quantity
we
can
interpret
the
one
by
the
other
set
up
the
one
as
the
equivalent
of
the
other
but
sooner
or
later
at
the
beginning
or
at
the
end
we
shall
have
to
recognize
the
conventional
character
of
this
assimilation
sidenote
psychophysics
merely
pushes
to
its
extreme
consequences
the
fundamental
but
natural
mistake
of
regarding
sensations
as
magnitudes
in
truth
psychophysics
merely
formulates
with
precision
and
pushes
to
its
extreme
consequences
a
conception
familiar
to
common
sense
as
speech
dominates
over
thought
as
external
objects
which
are
common
to
us
all
are
more
important
to
us
than
the
subjective
states
through
which
each
of
us
passes
we
have
everything
to
gain
by
objectifying
these
states
by
introducing
into
them
to
the
largest
possible
extent
the
representation
of
their
external
cause
and
the
more
our
knowledge
increases
the
more
we
perceive
the
extensive
behind
the
intensive
quantity
behind
quality
the
more
also
we
tend
to
thrust
the
former
into
the
latter
and
to
treat
our
sensations
as
magnitudes
physics
whose
particular
function
it
is
to
calculate
the
external
cause
of
our
internal
states
takes
the
least
possible
interest
in
these
states
themselves
constantly
and
deliberately
it
confuses
them
with
their
cause
it
thus
encourages
and
even
exaggerates
the
mistake
which
common
sense
makes
on
the
point
the
moment
was
inevitably
bound
to
come
at
which
science
familiarized
with
this
confusion
between
quality
and
quantity
between
sensation
and
stimulus
should
seek
to
measure
the
one
as
it
measures
the
other
such
was
the
object
of
psychophysics
in
this
bold
attempt
fechner
was
encouraged
by
his
adversaries
themselves
by
the
philosophers
who
speak
of
intensive
magnitudes
while
declaring
that
psychic
states
can
not
be
submitted
to
measurement
for
if
we
grant
that
one
sensation
can
be
stronger
than
another
and
that
this
inequality
is
inherent
in
the
sensations
themselves
independently
of
all
association
of
ideas
of
all
more
or
less
conscious
consideration
of
number
and
space
it
is
natural
to
ask
by
how
much
the
first
sensation
exceeds
the
second
and
to
set
up
a
quantitative
relation
between
their
intensities
nor
is
it
any
use
to
reply
as
the
opponents
of
psychophysics
sometimes
do
that
all
measurement
implies
superposition
and
that
there
is
no
occasion
to
seek
for
a
numerical
relation
between
intensities
which
are
not
superposable
objects
for
it
will
then
be
necessary
to
explain
why
one
sensation
is
said
to
be
more
intense
than
another
and
how
the
conceptions
of
greater
and
smaller
can
be
applied
to
things
which
it
has
just
been
acknowledged
do
not
admit
among
themselves
of
the
relations
of
container
to
contained
if
in
order
to
cut
short
any
question
of
this
kind
we
distinguish
two
kinds
of
quantity
the
one
intensive
which
admits
only
of
a
more
or
less
the
other
extensive
which
lends
itself
to
measurement
we
are
not
far
from
siding
with
fechner
and
the
psychophysicists
for
as
soon
as
a
thing
is
acknowledged
to
be
capable
of
increase
and
decrease
it
seems
natural
to
ask
by
how
much
it
decreases
or
by
how
much
it
increases
and
because
a
measurement
of
this
kind
does
not
appear
to
be
possible
directly
it
does
not
follow
that
science
can
not
successfully
accomplish
it
by
some
indirect
process
either
by
an
integration
of
infinitely
small
elements
as
fechner
proposes
or
by
any
other
roundabout
way
either
then
sensation
is
pure
quality
or
if
it
is
a
magnitude
we
ought
to
try
to
measure
it
sidenote
thus
intensity
judged
in
representative
states
by
an
estimate
of
the
magnitude
of
the
cause
in
affective
states
by
multiplicity
of
psychic
phenomena
involved
to
sum
up
what
precedes
we
have
found
the
notion
of
intensity
to
present
itself
under
a
double
aspect
according
as
we
study
the
states
of
consciousness
which
represent
an
external
cause
or
those
which
are
in
the
former
case
the
perception
of
intensity
consists
in
a
certain
estimate
of
the
magnitude
of
the
cause
means
of
a
certain
quality
in
the
effect
it
is
as
the
scottish
philosophers
would
have
said
an
acquired
perception
in
the
second
case
we
give
the
name
of
intensity
to
the
larger
or
smaller
number
of
simple
psychic
phenomena
which
we
conjecture
to
be
involved
in
the
fundamental
state
it
is
no
longer
an
perception
but
a
perception
in
fact
these
two
meanings
of
the
word
usually
intermingle
because
the
simpler
phenomena
involved
in
an
emotion
or
an
effort
are
generally
representative
and
because
the
majority
of
representative
states
being
at
the
same
time
affective
themselves
include
a
multiplicity
of
elementary
psychic
phenomena
the
idea
of
intensity
is
thus
situated
at
the
junction
of
two
streams
one
of
which
brings
us
the
idea
of
extensive
magnitude
from
without
while
the
other
brings
us
from
within
in
fact
from
the
very
depths
of
consciousness
the
image
of
an
inner
multiplicity
now
the
point
is
to
determine
in
what
the
latter
image
consists
whether
it
is
the
same
as
that
of
number
or
whether
it
is
quite
different
from
it
in
the
following
chapter
we
shall
no
longer
consider
states
of
consciousness
in
isolation
from
one
another
but
in
their
concrete
multiplicity
in
so
far
as
they
unfold
themselves
in
pure
duration
and
in
the
same
way
as
we
have
asked
what
would
be
the
intensity
of
a
representative
sensation
if
we
did
not
introduce
into
it
the
idea
of
its
cause
we
shall
now
have
to
inquire
what
the
multiplicity
of
our
inner
states
becomes
what
form
duration
assumes
when
the
space
in
which
it
unfolds
is
eliminated
this
second
question
is
even
more
important
than
the
first
for
if
the
confusion
of
quality
with
quantity
were
confined
to
each
of
the
phenomena
of
consciousness
taken
separately
it
would
give
rise
to
obscurities
as
we
have
just
seen
rather
than
to
problems
but
by
invading
the
series
of
our
psychic
states
by
introducing
space
into
our
perception
of
duration
it
corrupts
at
its
very
source
our
feeling
of
outer
and
inner
change
of
movement
and
of
freedom
hence
the
paradoxes
of
the
eleatics
hence
the
problem
of
free
will
we
shall
insist
rather
on
the
second
point
but
instead
of
seeking
to
solve
the
question
we
shall
show
the
mistake
of

the
multiplicity
of
conscious
states
the
idea
of
duration
sidenote
what
is
number
number
maybe
defined
in
general
as
a
collection
of
units
or
speaking
more
exactly
as
the
synthesis
of
the
one
and
the
many
every
number
is
one
since
it
is
brought
before
the
mind
by
a
simple
intuition
and
is
given
a
name
but
the
unity
which
attaches
to
it
is
that
of
a
sum
it
covers
a
multiplicity
of
parts
which
can
be
considered
separately
without
attempting
for
the
present
any
thorough
examination
of
these
conceptions
of
unity
and
multiplicity
let
us
inquire
whether
the
idea
of
number
does
not
imply
the
representation
of
something
else
as
well
sidenote
the
units
which
make
up
a
number
must
be
identical
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
number
is
a
collection
of
units
we
must
add
that
these
units
are
identical
with
one
another
or
at
least
that
they
are
assumed
to
be
identical
when
they
are
counted
no
doubt
we
can
count
the
sheep
in
a
flock
and
say
that
there
are
fifty
although
they
are
all
different
from
one
another
and
are
easily
recognized
by
the
shepherd
but
the
reason
is
that
we
agree
in
that
case
to
neglect
their
individual
differences
and
to
take
into
account
only
what
they
have
in
common
on
the
other
hand
as
soon
as
we
fix
our
attention
on
the
particular
features
of
objects
or
individuals
we
can
of
course
make
an
enumeration
of
them
but
not
a
total
we
place
ourselves
at
these
two
very
different
points
of
view
when
we
count
the
soldiers
in
a
battalion
and
when
we
call
the
roll
hence
we
may
conclude
that
the
idea
of
number
implies
the
simple
intuition
of
a
multiplicity
of
parts
or
units
which
are
absolutely
alike
sidenote
but
they
must
also
be
distinct
and
yet
they
must
be
somehow
distinct
from
one
another
since
otherwise
they
would
merge
into
a
single
unit
let
us
assume
that
all
the
sheep
in
the
flock
are
identical
they
differ
at
least
by
the
position
which
they
occupy
in
space
otherwise
they
would
not
form
a
flock
but
now
let
us
even
set
aside
the
fifty
sheep
themselves
and
retain
only
the
idea
of
them
either
we
include
them
all
in
the
same
image
and
it
follows
as
a
necessary
consequence
that
we
place
them
side
by
side
in
an
ideal
space
or
else
we
repeat
fifty
times
in
succession
the
image
of
a
single
one
and
in
that
case
it
does
seem
indeed
that
the
series
lies
in
duration
rather
than
in
space
but
we
shall
soon
find
out
that
it
can
not
be
so
for
if
we
picture
to
ourselves
each
of
the
sheep
in
the
flock
in
succession
and
separately
we
shall
never
have
to
do
with
more
than
a
single
sheep
in
order
that
the
number
should
go
on
increasing
in
proportion
as
we
advance
we
must
retain
the
successive
images
and
set
them
alongside
each
of
the
new
units
which
we
picture
to
ourselves
now
it
is
in
space
that
such
a
juxtaposition
takes
place
and
not
in
pure
duration
in
fact
it
will
be
easily
granted
that
counting
material
objects
means
thinking
all
these
objects
together
thereby
leaving
them
in
space
but
does
this
intuition
of
space
accompany
every
idea
of
number
even
of
an
abstract
number
sidenote
we
can
not
form
an
image
or
idea
of
number
without
the
accompanying
intuition
of
space
any
one
can
answer
this
question
by
reviewing
the
various
forms
which
the
idea
of
number
has
assumed
for
him
since
his
childhood
it
will
be
seen
that
we
began
by
imagining
a
row
of
balls
that
these
balls
afterwards
became
points
and
finally
this
image
itself
disappeared
leaving
behind
it
as
we
say
nothing
but
number
but
at
this
very
moment
we
ceased
to
have
an
image
or
even
an
idea
of
it
we
kept
only
the
symbol
which
is
necessary
for
reckoning
and
which
is
the
conventional
way
of
number
for
we
can
confidently
assert
that
is
half
of
without
thinking
either
the
number
or
the
number
indeed
as
far
as
quick
calculation
is
concerned
we
have
everything
to
gain
by
not
doing
so
but
as
soon
as
we
wish
to
picture
to
ourselves
and
not
merely
figures
or
words
we
are
compelled
to
have
recourse
to
an
extended
image
what
leads
to
misunderstanding
on
this
point
seems
to
be
the
habit
we
have
fallen
into
of
counting
in
time
rather
than
in
space
in
order
to
imagine
the
number
for
example
we
repeat
all
the
numbers
starting
from
unity
and
when
we
have
arrived
at
the
fiftieth
we
believe
we
have
built
up
the
number
in
duration
and
in
duration
only
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
this
way
we
have
counted
moments
of
duration
rather
than
points
in
space
but
the
question
is
whether
we
have
not
counted
the
moments
of
duration
by
means
of
points
in
space
it
is
certainly
possible
to
perceive
in
time
and
in
time
only
a
succession
which
is
nothing
but
a
succession
but
not
an
addition
a
succession
which
culminates
in
a
sum
for
though
we
reach
a
sum
by
taking
into
account
a
succession
of
different
terms
yet
it
is
necessary
that
each
of
these
terms
should
remain
when
we
pass
to
the
following
and
should
wait
so
to
speak
to
be
added
to
the
others
how
could
it
wait
if
it
were
nothing
but
an
instant
of
duration
and
where
could
it
wait
if
we
did
not
localize
it
in
space
we
involuntarily
fix
at
a
point
in
space
each
of
the
moments
which
we
count
and
it
is
only
on
this
condition
that
the
abstract
units
come
to
form
a
sum
no
doubt
it
is
possible
as
we
shall
show
later
to
conceive
the
successive
moments
of
time
independently
of
space
but
when
we
add
to
the
present
moment
those
which
have
preceded
it
as
is
the
case
when
we
are
adding
up
units
we
are
not
dealing
with
these
moments
themselves
since
they
have
vanished
for
ever
but
with
the
lasting
traces
which
they
seem
to
have
left
in
space
on
their
passage
through
it
it
is
true
that
we
generally
dispense
with
this
mental
image
and
that
after
having
used
it
for
the
first
two
or
three
numbers
it
is
enough
to
know
that
it
would
serve
just
as
well
for
the
mental
picturing
of
the
others
if
we
needed
it
but
every
clear
idea
of
number
implies
a
visual
image
in
space
and
the
direct
study
of
the
units
which
go
to
form
a
discrete
multiplicity
will
lead
us
to
the
same
conclusion
on
this
point
as
the
examination
of
number
itself
sidenote
all
unity
is
the
unity
of
a
simple
act
of
the
mind
unity
divisible
only
because
regarded
as
extended
in
space
every
number
is
a
collection
of
units
as
we
have
said
and
on
the
other
hand
every
number
is
itself
a
unit
in
so
far
as
it
is
a
synthesis
of
the
units
which
compose
it
but
is
the
word
unit
taken
in
the
same
sense
in
both
cases
when
we
assert
that
number
is
a
unit
we
understand
by
this
that
we
master
the
whole
of
it
by
a
simple
and
indivisible
intuition
of
the
mind
this
unity
thus
includes
a
multiplicity
since
it
is
the
unity
of
a
whole
but
when
we
speak
of
the
units
which
go
to
form
number
we
no
longer
think
of
these
units
as
sums
but
as
pure
simple
irreducible
units
intended
to
yield
the
natural
series
of
numbers
by
an
indefinitely
continued
process
of
accumulation
it
seems
then
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
units
the
one
ultimate
out
of
which
a
number
is
formed
by
a
process
of
addition
and
the
other
provisional
the
number
so
formed
which
is
multiple
in
itself
and
owes
its
unity
to
the
simplicity
of
the
act
by
which
the
mind
perceives
it
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
when
we
picture
the
units
which
make
up
number
we
believe
that
we
are
thinking
of
indivisible
components
this
belief
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
idea
that
it
is
possible
to
conceive
number
independently
of
space
nevertheless
by
looking
more
closely
into
the
matter
we
shall
see
that
all
unity
is
the
unity
of
a
simple
act
of
the
mind
and
that
as
this
is
an
act
of
unification
there
must
be
some
multiplicity
for
it
to
unify
no
doubt
at
the
moment
at
which
i
think
each
of
these
units
separately
i
look
upon
it
as
indivisible
since
i
am
determined
to
think
of
its
unity
alone
but
as
soon
as
i
put
it
aside
in
order
to
pass
to
the
next
i
objectify
it
and
by
that
very
deed
i
make
it
a
thing
that
is
to
say
a
multiplicity
to
convince
oneself
of
this
it
is
enough
to
notice
that
the
units
by
means
of
which
arithmetic
forms
numbers
are
units
which
can
be
subdivided
without
limit
and
that
each
of
them
is
the
sum
of
fractional
quantities
as
small
and
as
numerous
as
we
like
to
imagine
how
could
we
divide
the
unit
if
it
were
here
that
ultimate
unity
which
characterizes
a
simple
act
of
the
mind
how
could
we
split
it
up
into
fractions
whilst
affirming
its
unity
if
we
did
not
regard
it
implicitly
as
an
extended
object
one
in
intuition
but
multiple
in
space
you
will
never
get
out
of
an
idea
which
you
have
formed
anything
which
you
have
not
put
into
it
and
if
the
unity
by
means
of
which
you
make
up
your
number
is
the
unity
of
an
act
and
not
of
an
object
no
effort
of
analysis
will
bring
out
of
it
anything
but
unity
pure
and
simple
no
doubt
when
you
equate
the
number
to
the
sum
of
nothing
prevents
you
from
regarding
the
units
which
compose
it
as
indivisible
but
the
reason
is
that
you
do
not
choose
to
make
use
of
the
multiplicity
which
is
enclosed
within
each
of
these
units
indeed
it
is
probable
that
the
number
first
assumes
to
our
mind
this
simpler
shape
because
we
think
rather
of
the
way
in
which
we
have
obtained
it
than
of
the
use
which
we
might
make
of
it
but
we
soon
perceive
that
while
all
multiplication
implies
the
possibility
of
treating
any
number
whatever
as
a
provisional
unit
which
can
be
added
to
itself
inversely
the
units
in
their
turn
are
true
numbers
which
are
as
big
as
we
like
but
are
regarded
as
provisionally
indivisible
for
the
purpose
of
compounding
them
with
one
another
now
the
very
admission
that
it
is
possible
to
divide
the
unit
into
as
many
parts
as
we
like
shows
that
we
regard
it
as
extended
sidenote
number
in
process
of
formation
is
discontinuous
but
when
formed
is
invested
with
the
continuity
of
space
for
we
must
understand
what
is
meant
by
the
of
number
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
formation
or
construction
of
a
number
implies
discontinuity
in
other
words
as
we
remarked
above
each
of
the
units
with
which
we
form
the
number
seems
to
be
indivisible
we
are
dealing
with
it
and
we
pass
abruptly
from
one
to
the
other
again
if
we
form
the
same
number
with
halves
with
quarters
with
any
units
whatever
these
units
in
so
far
as
they
serve
to
form
the
said
number
will
still
constitute
elements
which
are
provisionally
indivisible
and
it
is
always
by
jerks
by
sudden
jumps
so
to
speak
that
we
advance
from
one
to
the
other
and
the
reason
is
that
in
order
to
get
a
number
we
are
compelled
to
fix
our
attention
successively
on
each
of
the
units
of
which
it
is
compounded
the
indivisibility
of
the
act
by
which
we
conceive
any
one
of
them
is
then
represented
under
the
form
of
a
mathematical
point
which
is
separated
from
the
following
point
by
an
interval
of
space
but
while
a
series
of
mathematical
points
arranged
in
empty
space
expresses
fairly
well
the
process
by
which
we
form
the
idea
of
number
these
mathematical
points
have
a
tendency
to
develop
into
lines
in
proportion
as
our
attention
is
diverted
from
them
as
if
they
were
trying
to
reunite
with
one
another
and
when
we
look
at
number
in
its
finished
state
this
union
is
an
accomplished
fact
the
points
have
become
lines
the
divisions
have
been
blotted
out
the
whole
displays
all
the
characteristics
of
continuity
this
is
why
number
although
we
have
formed
it
according
to
a
definite
law
can
be
split
up
on
any
system
we
please
in
a
word
we
must
distinguish
between
the
unity
which
we
think
of
and
the
unity
which
we
set
up
as
an
object
after
having
thought
of
it
as
also
between
number
in
process
of
formation
and
number
once
formed
the
unit
is
irreducible
while
we
are
thinking
it
and
number
is
discontinuous
while
we
are
building
it
up
but
as
soon
as
we
consider
number
in
its
finished
state
we
objectify
it
and
it
then
appears
to
be
divisible
to
an
unlimited
extent
in
fact
we
apply
the
term
to
what
seems
to
be
completely
and
adequately
known
and
the
term
to
what
is
known
in
such
a
way
that
a
constantly
increasing
number
of
new
impressions
could
be
substituted
for
the
idea
which
we
actually
have
of
it
thus
a
complex
feeling
will
contain
a
fairly
large
number
of
simple
elements
but
as
long
as
these
elements
do
not
stand
out
with
perfect
clearness
we
can
not
say
that
they
were
completely
realized
and
as
soon
as
consciousness
has
a
distinct
perception
of
them
the
psychic
state
which
results
from
their
synthesis
will
have
changed
for
this
very
reason
but
there
is
no
change
in
the
general
appearance
of
a
body
however
it
is
analysed
by
thought
because
these
different
analyses
and
an
infinity
of
others
are
already
visible
in
the
mental
image
which
we
form
of
the
body
though
they
are
not
realized
this
actual
and
not
merely
virtual
perception
of
subdivisions
in
what
is
undivided
is
just
what
we
call
objectivity
it
then
becomes
easy
to
determine
the
exact
part
played
by
the
subjective
and
the
objective
in
the
idea
of
number
what
properly
belongs
to
the
mind
is
the
indivisible
process
by
which
it
concentrates
attention
successively
on
the
different
parts
of
a
given
space
but
the
parts
which
have
thus
been
isolated
remain
in
order
to
join
with
the
others
and
once
the
addition
is
made
they
may
be
broken
up
in
any
way
whatever
they
are
therefore
parts
of
space
and
space
is
accordingly
the
material
with
which
the
mind
builds
up
number
the
medium
in
which
the
mind
places
it
properly
speaking
it
is
arithmetic
which
teaches
us
to
split
up
without
limit
the
units
of
which
number
consists
common
sense
is
very
much
inclined
to
build
up
number
with
indivisibles
sidenote
it
follows
that
number
is
actually
as
a
juxtaposition
in
space
and
this
is
easily
understood
since
the
provisional
simplicity
of
the
component
units
is
just
what
they
owe
to
the
mind
and
the
latter
pays
more
attention
to
its
own
acts
than
to
the
material
on
which
it
works
science
confines
itself
here
to
drawing
our
attention
to
this
material
if
we
did
not
already
localize
number
in
space
science
would
certainly
not
succeed
in
making
us
transfer
it
thither
from
the
beginning
therefore
we
must
have
thought
of
number
as
of
a
juxtaposition
in
space
this
is
the
conclusion
which
we
reached
at
first
basing
ourselves
on
the
fact
that
all
addition
implies
a
multiplicity
of
parts
simultaneously
perceived
sidenote
two
kinds
of
multiplicity
material
objects
counted
in
space
conscious
states
not
countable
unless
symbolically
represented
in
space
now
if
this
conception
of
number
is
granted
it
will
be
seen
that
everything
is
not
counted
in
the
same
way
and
that
there
are
two
very
different
kinds
of
multiplicity
when
we
speak
of
material
objects
we
refer
to
the
possibility
of
seeing
and
touching
them
we
localize
them
in
space
in
that
case
no
effort
of
the
inventive
faculty
or
of
symbolical
representation
is
necessary
in
order
to
count
them
we
have
only
to
think
them
at
first
separately
and
then
simultaneously
within
the
very
medium
in
which
they
come
under
our
observation
the
case
is
no
longer
the
same
when
we
consider
purely
affective
psychic
states
or
even
mental
images
other
than
those
built
up
by
means
of
sight
and
touch
here
the
terms
being
no
longer
given
in
space
it
seems
priori
that
we
can
hardly
count
them
except
by
some
process
of
symbolical
representation
in
fact
we
are
well
aware
of
a
representation
of
this
kind
when
we
are
dealing
with
sensations
the
cause
of
which
is
obviously
situated
in
space
thus
when
we
hear
a
noise
of
steps
in
the
street
we
have
a
confused
vision
of
somebody
walking
along
each
of
the
successive
sounds
is
then
localized
at
a
point
in
space
where
the
might
tread
we
count
our
sensations
in
the
very
space
in
which
their
tangible
causes
are
ranged
perhaps
some
people
count
the
successive
strokes
of
a
distant
bell
in
a
similar
way
their
imagination
pictures
the
bell
coming
and
going
this
spatial
sort
of
image
is
sufficient
for
the
first
two
units
and
the
others
follow
naturally
but
most
people
minds
do
not
proceed
in
this
way
they
range
the
successive
sounds
in
an
ideal
space
and
then
fancy
that
they
are
counting
them
in
pure
duration
yet
we
must
be
clear
on
this
point
the
sounds
of
the
bell
certainly
reach
me
one
after
the
other
but
one
of
two
alternatives
must
be
true
either
i
retain
each
of
these
successive
sensations
in
order
to
combine
it
with
the
others
and
form
a
group
which
reminds
me
of
an
air
or
rhythm
which
i
know
in
that
case
i
do
not
the
sounds
i
limit
myself
to
gathering
so
to
speak
the
qualitative
impression
produced
by
the
whole
series
or
else
i
intend
explicitly
to
count
them
and
then
i
shall
have
to
separate
them
and
this
separation
must
take
place
within
some
homogeneous
medium
in
which
the
sounds
stripped
of
their
qualities
and
in
a
manner
emptied
leave
traces
of
their
presence
which
are
absolutely
alike
the
question
now
is
whether
this
medium
is
time
or
space
but
a
moment
of
time
we
repeat
can
not
persist
in
order
to
be
added
to
others
if
the
sounds
are
separated
they
must
leave
empty
intervals
bet
ween
them
if
we
count
them
the
intervals
must
remain
though
the
sounds
disappear
how
could
these
intervals
remain
if
they
were
pure
duration
and
not
space
it
is
in
space
therefore
that
the
operation
takes
place
it
becomes
indeed
more
and
more
difficult
as
we
penetrate
further
into
the
depths
of
consciousness
here
we
find
ourselves
confronted
by
a
confused
multiplicity
of
sensations
and
feelings
which
analysis
alone
can
distinguish
their
number
is
identical
with
the
number
of
the
moments
which
we
take
up
when
we
count
them
but
these
moments
as
they
can
be
added
to
one
another
are
again
points
in
space
our
final
conclusion
therefore
is
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
multiplicity
that
of
material
objects
to
which
the
conception
of
number
is
immediately
applicable
and
the
multiplicity
of
states
of
consciousness
which
can
not
be
regarded
as
numerical
without
the
help
of
some
symbolical
representation
in
which
a
necessary
element
is
sidenote
the
impenetrability
of
matter
is
not
a
physical
but
a
logical
necessity
as
a
matter
of
fact
each
of
us
makes
a
distinction
between
these
two
kinds
of
multiplicity
whenever
he
speaks
of
the
impenetrability
of
matter
we
sometimes
set
up
impenetrability
as
a
fundamental
property
of
bodies
known
in
the
same
way
and
put
on
the
same
level
as
weight
or
resistance
but
a
purely
negative
property
of
this
kind
can
not
be
revealed
by
our
senses
indeed
certain
experiments
in
mixing
and
combining
things
might
lead
us
to
call
it
in
question
if
our
minds
were
not
already
made
up
on
the
point
try
to
picture
one
body
penetrating
another
you
will
at
once
assume
that
there
are
empty
spaces
in
the
one
which
will
be
occupied
by
the
particles
of
the
other
these
particles
in
their
turn
can
not
penetrate
one
another
unless
one
of
them
divides
in
order
to
fill
up
the
interstices
of
the
other
and
our
thought
will
prolong
this
operation
indefinitely
in
preference
to
picturing
two
bodies
in
the
same
place
now
if
impenetrability
were
really
a
quality
of
matter
which
was
known
by
the
senses
it
is
not
at
all
clear
why
we
should
experience
more
difficulty
in
conceiving
two
bodies
merging
into
one
another
than
a
surface
devoid
of
resistance
or
a
weightless
fluid
in
reality
it
is
not
a
physical
but
a
logical
necessity
which
attaches
to
the
proposition
two
bodies
can
not
occupy
the
same
place
at
the
same
time
the
contrary
assertion
involves
an
absurdity
which
no
conceivable
experience
could
succeed
in
dispelling
in
a
word
it
implies
a
contradiction
but
does
not
this
amount
to
recognizing
that
the
very
idea
of
the
number
or
more
generally
of
any
number
whatever
involves
the
idea
of
juxtaposition
in
space
if
impenetrability
is
generally
regarded
as
a
quality
of
matter
the
reason
is
that
the
idea
of
number
is
thought
to
be
independent
of
the
idea
of
space
we
thus
believe
that
we
are
adding
something
to
the
idea
of
two
or
more
objects
by
saying
that
they
can
not
occupy
the
same
place
as
if
the
idea
of
the
number
even
the
abstract
number
were
not
already
as
we
have
shown
that
of
two
different
positions
in
space
hence
to
assert
the
impenetrability
of
matter
is
simply
to
recognize
the
interconnexion
between
the
notions
of
number
and
space
it
is
to
state
a
property
of
number
rather
than
of
yet
it
will
be
said
do
we
not
count
feelings
sensations
ideas
all
of
which
permeate
one
another
and
each
of
which
for
its
part
takes
up
the
whole
of
the
soul
yes
undoubtedly
but
just
because
they
permeate
one
another
we
can
not
count
them
unless
we
represent
them
by
homogeneous
units
which
occupy
separate
positions
in
space
and
consequently
no
longer
permeate
one
another
impenetrability
thus
makes
its
appearance
at
the
same
time
as
number
and
when
we
attribute
this
quality
to
matter
in
order
to
distinguish
it
from
everything
which
is
not
matter
we
simply
state
under
another
form
the
distinction
established
above
between
extended
objects
to
which
the
conception
of
number
is
immediately
applicable
and
states
of
consciousness
which
have
first
of
all
to
be
represented
symbolically
in
space
sidenote
homogeneous
time
as
the
medium
in
which
conscious
states
form
discrete
series
this
time
is
nothing
but
space
and
pure
duration
is
something
different
it
is
advisable
to
dwell
on
the
last
point
if
in
order
to
count
states
of
consciousness
we
have
to
represent
them
symbolically
in
space
is
it
not
likely
that
this
symbolical
representation
will
alter
the
normal
conditions
of
inner
perception
let
us
recall
what
we
said
a
short
time
ago
about
the
intensity
of
certain
psychic
states
representative
sensation
looked
at
in
itself
is
pure
quality
but
seen
through
the
medium
of
extensity
this
quality
becomes
in
a
certain
sense
quantity
and
is
called
intensity
in
the
same
way
our
projection
of
our
psychic
states
into
space
in
order
to
form
a
discrete
multiplicity
is
likely
to
influence
these
states
themselves
and
to
give
them
in
reflective
consciousness
a
new
form
which
immediate
perception
did
not
attribute
to
them
now
let
us
notice
that
when
we
speak
of
we
generally
think
of
a
homogeneous
medium
in
which
our
conscious
states
are
ranged
alongside
one
another
as
in
space
so
as
to
form
a
discrete
multiplicity
would
not
time
thus
understood
be
to
the
multiplicity
of
our
psychic
states
what
intensity
is
to
certain
of
them
a
sign
a
symbol
absolutely
distinct
from
true
duration
let
us
ask
consciousness
to
isolate
itself
from
the
external
world
and
by
a
vigorous
effort
of
abstraction
to
become
itself
again
we
shall
then
put
this
question
to
it
does
the
multiplicity
of
our
conscious
states
bear
the
slightest
resemblance
to
the
multiplicity
of
the
units
of
a
number
has
true
duration
anything
to
do
with
space
certainly
our
analysis
of
the
idea
of
number
could
not
but
make
us
doubt
this
analogy
to
say
no
more
for
if
time
as
the
reflective
consciousness
represents
it
is
a
medium
in
which
our
conscious
states
form
a
discrete
series
so
as
to
admit
of
being
counted
and
if
on
the
other
hand
our
conception
of
number
ends
in
spreading
out
in
space
everything
which
can
be
directly
counted
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
time
understood
in
the
sense
of
a
medium
in
which
we
make
distinctions
and
count
is
nothing
but
space
that
which
goes
to
confirm
this
opinion
is
that
we
are
compelled
to
borrow
from
space
the
images
by
which
we
describe
what
the
reflective
consciousness
feels
about
time
and
even
about
succession
it
follows
that
pure
duration
must
be
something
different
such
are
the
questions
which
we
have
been
led
to
ask
by
the
very
analysis
of
the
notion
of
discrete
multiplicity
but
we
can
not
throw
any
light
upon
them
except
by
a
direct
study
of
the
ideas
of
space
and
time
in
their
mutual
relations
sidenote
does
space
exist
independently
of
its
contents
as
kant
held
we
shall
not
lay
too
much
stress
on
the
question
of
the
absolute
reality
of
space
perhaps
we
might
as
well
ask
whether
space
is
or
is
not
in
space
in
short
our
senses
perceive
the
qualities
of
bodies
and
space
along
with
them
the
great
difficulty
seems
to
have
been
to
discover
whether
extensity
is
an
aspect
of
these
physical
qualities
a
quality
of
quality
or
whether
these
qualities
are
essentially
unextended
space
coming
in
as
a
later
addition
but
being
and
existing
without
them
on
the
first
hypothesis
space
would
be
reduced
to
an
abstraction
or
speaking
more
correctly
an
extract
it
would
express
the
common
element
possessed
by
certain
sensations
called
representative
in
the
second
case
space
would
be
a
reality
as
solid
as
the
sensations
themselves
although
of
a
different
order
we
owe
the
exact
formulation
of
this
latter
conception
to
kant
the
theory
which
he
works
out
in
the
transcendental
aesthetic
consists
in
endowing
space
with
an
existence
independent
of
its
content
in
laying
down
as
separable
what
each
of
us
separates
facto
and
in
refusing
to
regard
extensity
as
an
abstraction
like
the
others
in
this
respect
the
kantian
conception
of
space
differs
less
than
is
usually
imagined
from
the
popular
belief
far
from
shaking
our
faith
in
the
reality
of
space
kant
has
shown
what
it
actually
means
and
has
even
justified
it
sidenote
the
empiricists
really
agree
with
kant
for
extensity
can
not
result
from
synthesis
of
unextended
sensations
without
an
act
of
the
mind
moreover
the
solution
given
by
kant
does
not
seem
to
have
been
seriously
disputed
since
his
time
indeed
it
has
forced
itself
sometimes
without
their
knowledge
on
the
majority
of
those
who
have
approached
the
problem
anew
whether
nativists
or
empiricists
psychologists
agree
in
assigning
a
kantian
origin
to
the
nativistic
explanation
of
johann
müller
but
lotze
hypothesis
of
local
signs
bain
theory
and
the
more
comprehensive
explanation
suggested
by
wundt
may
seem
at
first
quite
independent
of
the
transcendental
aesthetic
the
authors
of
these
theories
seem
indeed
to
have
put
aside
the
problem
of
the
nature
of
space
in
order
to
investigate
simply
by
what
process
our
sensations
come
to
be
situated
in
space
and
to
be
set
so
to
speak
alongside
one
another
but
this
very
question
shows
that
they
regard
sensations
as
inextensive
and
make
a
radical
distinction
just
as
kant
did
between
the
matter
of
representation
and
its
form
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
the
theories
of
lotze
and
bain
and
from
wundt
attempt
to
reconcile
them
is
that
the
sensations
by
means
of
which
we
come
to
form
the
notion
of
space
are
themselves
unextended
and
simply
qualitative
extensity
is
supposed
to
result
from
their
synthesis
as
water
from
the
combination
of
two
gases
the
empirical
or
genetic
explanations
have
thus
taken
up
the
problem
of
space
at
the
very
point
where
kant
left
it
kant
separated
space
from
its
contents
the
empiricists
ask
how
these
contents
which
are
taken
out
of
space
by
our
thought
manage
to
get
back
again
it
is
true
that
they
have
apparently
disregarded
the
activity
of
the
mind
and
that
they
are
obviously
inclined
to
regard
the
extensive
form
under
which
we
represent
things
as
produced
by
a
kind
of
alliance
of
the
sensations
with
one
another
space
without
being
extracted
from
the
sensations
is
supposed
to
result
from
their
but
how
can
we
explain
such
an
origination
without
the
active
intervention
of
the
mind
the
extensive
differs
by
hypothesis
from
the
inextensive
and
even
if
we
assume
that
extension
is
nothing
but
a
relation
between
inextensive
terms
this
relation
must
still
be
established
by
a
mind
capable
of
thus
associating
several
terms
it
is
no
use
quoting
the
example
of
chemical
combinations
in
which
the
whole
seems
to
assume
of
its
own
accord
a
form
and
qualities
which
did
not
belong
to
any
of
the
elementary
atoms
this
form
and
these
qualities
owe
their
origin
just
to
the
fact
that
we
gather
up
the
multiplicity
of
atoms
in
a
single
perception
get
rid
of
the
mind
which
carries
out
this
synthesis
and
you
will
at
once
do
away
with
the
qualities
that
is
to
say
the
aspect
under
which
the
synthesis
of
elementary
parts
is
presented
to
our
consciousness
thus
inextensive
sensations
will
remain
what
they
are
inextensive
sensations
if
nothing
be
added
to
them
for
their
to
give
rise
to
space
there
must
be
an
act
of
the
mind
which
takes
them
in
all
at
the
same
time
and
sets
them
in
juxtaposition
this
unique
act
is
very
like
what
kant
calls
an
form
of
sensibility
sidenote
this
act
consists
in
the
intuition
of
an
empty
homogeneous
medium
perhaps
peculiar
to
man
and
not
shared
by
animals
if
we
now
seek
to
characterize
this
act
we
see
that
it
consists
essentially
in
the
intuition
or
rather
the
conception
of
an
empty
homogeneous
medium
for
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
give
any
other
definition
of
space
space
is
what
enables
us
to
distinguish
a
number
of
identical
and
simultaneous
sensations
from
one
another
it
is
thus
a
principle
of
differentiation
other
than
that
of
qualitative
differentiation
and
consequently
it
is
a
reality
with
no
quality
someone
may
say
with
the
believers
in
the
theory
of
local
signs
that
simultaneous
sensations
are
never
identical
and
that
in
consequence
of
the
diversity
of
the
organic
elements
which
they
affect
there
are
no
two
points
of
a
homogeneous
surface
which
make
the
same
impression
on
the
sight
or
the
touch
we
are
quite
ready
to
grant
it
for
if
these
two
points
affected
us
in
the
same
way
there
would
be
no
reason
for
placing
one
of
them
on
the
right
rather
than
on
the
left
but
just
because
we
afterwards
interpret
this
difference
of
quality
in
the
sense
of
a
difference
of
situation
it
follows
that
we
must
have
a
clear
idea
of
a
homogeneous
medium
of
a
simultaneity
of
terms
which
although
identical
in
quality
are
yet
distinct
from
one
another
the
more
you
insist
on
the
difference
between
the
impressions
made
on
our
retina
by
two
points
of
a
homogeneous
surface
the
more
do
you
thereby
make
room
for
the
activity
of
the
mind
which
perceives
under
the
form
of
extensive
homogeneity
what
is
given
it
as
qualitative
heterogeneity
no
doubt
though
the
representation
of
a
homogeneous
space
grows
out
of
an
effort
of
the
mind
there
must
be
within
the
qualities
themselves
which
differentiate
two
sensations
some
reason
why
they
occupy
this
or
that
definite
position
in
space
we
must
thus
distinguish
between
the
perception
of
extensity
and
the
conception
of
space
they
are
no
doubt
implied
in
one
another
but
the
higher
we
rise
in
the
scale
of
intelligent
beings
the
more
clearly
do
we
meet
with
the
independent
idea
of
a
homogeneous
space
it
is
therefore
doubtful
whether
animals
perceive
the
external
world
quite
as
we
do
and
especially
whether
they
represent
externality
in
the
same
way
as
ourselves
naturalists
have
pointed
out
as
a
remarkable
fact
the
surprising
ease
with
which
many
vertebrates
and
even
some
insects
manage
to
find
their
way
through
space
animals
have
been
seen
to
return
almost
in
a
straight
line
to
their
old
home
pursuing
a
path
which
was
hitherto
unknown
to
them
over
a
distance
which
may
amount
to
several
hundreds
of
miles
attempts
have
been
made
to
explain
this
feeling
of
direction
by
sight
or
smell
and
more
recently
by
the
perception
of
magnetic
currents
which
would
enable
the
animal
to
take
its
bearings
like
a
living
compass
this
amounts
to
saying
that
space
is
not
so
homogeneous
for
the
animal
as
for
us
and
that
determinations
of
space
or
directions
do
not
assume
for
it
a
purely
geometrical
form
each
of
these
directions
might
appear
to
it
with
its
own
shade
its
peculiar
quality
we
shall
understand
how
a
perception
of
this
kind
is
possible
if
we
remember
that
we
ourselves
distinguish
our
right
from
our
left
by
a
natural
feeling
and
that
these
two
parts
of
our
own
extensity
do
then
appear
to
us
as
if
they
bore
a
different
in
fact
this
is
the
very
reason
why
we
can
not
give
a
proper
definition
of
right
and
left
in
truth
qualitative
differences
exist
everywhere
in
nature
and
i
do
not
see
why
two
concrete
directions
should
not
be
as
marked
in
immediate
perception
as
two
colours
but
the
conception
of
an
empty
homogeneous
medium
is
something
far
more
extraordinary
being
a
kind
of
reaction
against
that
heterogeneity
which
is
the
very
ground
of
our
experience
therefore
instead
of
saying
that
animals
have
a
special
sense
of
direction
we
may
as
well
say
that
men
have
a
special
faculty
of
perceiving
or
conceiving
a
space
without
quality
this
faculty
is
not
the
faculty
of
abstraction
indeed
if
we
notice
that
abstraction
assumes
distinctions
and
a
kind
of
externality
of
the
concepts
or
their
symbols
with
regard
to
one
another
we
shall
find
that
the
faculty
of
abstraction
already
implies
the
intuition
of
a
homogeneous
medium
what
we
must
say
is
that
we
have
to
do
with
two
different
kinds
of
reality
the
one
heterogeneous
that
of
sensible
qualities
the
other
homogeneous
namely
space
this
latter
clearly
conceived
by
the
human
intellect
enables
us
to
use
distinctions
to
count
to
abstract
and
perhaps
also
to
speak
sidenote
time
in
so
far
as
it
is
a
homogenious
medium
and
not
concrete
duration
is
reducible
to
space
now
if
space
is
to
be
defined
as
the
homogeneous
it
seems
that
inversely
every
homogeneous
and
unbounded
medium
will
be
space
for
homogeneity
here
consisting
in
the
absence
of
every
quality
it
is
hard
to
see
how
two
forms
of
the
homogeneous
could
be
distinguished
from
one
another
nevertheless
it
is
generally
agreed
to
regard
time
as
an
unbounded
medium
different
from
space
but
homogeneous
like
the
latter
the
homogeneous
is
thus
supposed
to
take
two
forms
according
as
its
contents
or
follow
one
another
it
is
true
that
when
we
make
time
a
homogeneous
medium
in
which
conscious
states
unfold
themselves
we
take
it
to
be
given
all
at
once
which
amounts
to
saying
that
we
abstract
it
from
duration
this
simple
consideration
ought
to
warn
us
that
we
are
thus
unwittingly
falling
back
upon
space
and
really
giving
up
time
moreover
we
can
understand
that
material
objects
being
exterior
to
one
another
and
to
ourselves
derive
both
exteriorities
from
the
homogeneity
of
a
medium
which
inserts
intervals
between
them
and
sets
off
their
outlines
but
states
of
consciousness
even
when
successive
permeate
one
another
and
in
the
simplest
of
them
the
whole
soul
can
be
reflected
we
may
therefore
surmise
that
time
conceived
under
the
form
of
a
homogeneous
medium
is
some
spurious
concept
due
to
the
trespassing
of
the
idea
of
space
upon
the
field
of
pure
consciousness
at
any
rate
we
can
not
finally
admit
two
forms
of
the
homogeneous
time
and
space
without
first
seeking
whether
one
of
them
can
not
be
reduced
to
the
other
now
externality
is
the
distinguishing
mark
of
things
which
occupy
space
while
states
of
consciousness
are
not
essentially
external
to
one
another
and
become
so
only
by
being
spread
out
in
time
regarded
as
a
homogeneous
medium
if
then
one
of
these
two
supposed
forms
of
the
homogeneous
namely
time
and
space
is
derived
from
the
other
we
can
surmise
that
the
idea
of
space
is
the
fundamental
datum
but
misled
by
the
apparent
simplicity
of
the
idea
of
time
the
philosophers
who
have
tried
to
reduce
one
of
these
ideas
to
the
other
have
thought
that
they
could
make
extensity
out
of
duration
while
showing
how
they
have
been
misled
we
shall
see
that
time
conceived
under
the
form
of
an
unbounded
and
homogeneous
medium
is
nothing
but
the
ghost
of
space
haunting
the
reflective
consciousness
sidenote
mistake
of
the
attempt
to
derive
relations
of
extensity
from
those
of
succession
the
conception
of
pure
duration
the
english
school
tries
in
fact
to
reduce
relations
of
extensity
to
more
or
less
complex
relations
of
succession
in
time
when
with
our
eyes
shut
we
run
our
hands
along
a
surface
the
rubbing
of
our
fingers
against
the
surface
and
especially
the
varied
play
of
our
joints
provide
a
series
of
sensations
which
differ
only
by
their
and
which
exhibit
a
certain
order
in
time
moreover
experience
teaches
us
that
this
series
can
be
reversed
that
we
can
by
an
effort
of
a
different
kind
or
as
we
shall
call
it
later
an
opposite
direction
obtain
the
same
sensations
over
again
in
an
inverse
order
relations
of
position
in
space
might
then
be
defined
as
reversible
relations
of
succession
in
time
but
such
a
definition
involves
a
vicious
circle
or
at
least
a
very
superficial
idea
of
time
there
are
indeed
as
we
shall
show
a
little
later
two
possible
conceptions
of
time
the
one
free
from
all
alloy
the
other
surreptitiously
bringing
in
the
idea
of
space
pure
duration
is
the
form
which
the
succession
of
our
conscious
states
assumes
when
our
ego
lets
itself
when
it
refrains
from
separating
its
present
state
from
its
former
states
for
this
purpose
it
need
not
be
entirely
absorbed
in
the
passing
sensation
or
idea
for
then
on
the
contrary
it
would
no
longer
nor
need
it
forget
its
former
states
it
is
enough
that
in
recalling
these
states
it
does
not
set
them
alongside
its
actual
state
as
one
point
alongside
another
but
forms
both
the
past
and
the
present
states
into
an
organic
whole
as
happens
when
we
recall
the
notes
of
a
tune
melting
so
to
speak
into
one
another
might
it
not
be
said
that
even
if
these
notes
succeed
one
another
yet
we
perceive
them
in
one
another
and
that
their
totality
may
be
compared
to
a
living
being
whose
parts
although
distinct
permeate
one
another
just
because
they
are
so
closely
connected
the
proof
is
that
if
we
interrupt
the
rhythm
by
dwelling
longer
than
is
right
on
one
note
of
the
tune
it
is
not
its
exaggerated
length
as
length
which
will
warn
us
of
our
mistake
but
the
qualitative
change
thereby
caused
in
the
whole
of
the
musical
phrase
we
can
thus
conceive
of
succession
without
distinction
and
think
of
it
as
a
mutual
penetration
an
interconnexion
and
organization
of
elements
each
one
of
which
represents
the
whole
and
can
not
be
distinguished
or
isolated
from
it
except
by
abstract
thought
such
is
the
account
of
duration
which
would
be
given
by
a
being
who
was
ever
the
same
and
ever
changing
and
who
had
no
idea
of
space
but
familiar
with
the
latter
idea
and
indeed
beset
by
it
we
introduce
it
unwittingly
into
our
feeling
of
pure
succession
we
set
our
states
of
consciousness
side
by
side
in
such
a
way
as
to
perceive
them
simultaneously
no
longer
in
one
another
but
alongside
one
another
in
a
word
we
project
time
into
space
we
express
duration
in
terms
of
extensity
and
succession
thus
takes
the
form
of
a
continuous
line
or
a
chain
the
parts
of
which
touch
without
penetrating
one
another
note
that
the
mental
image
thus
shaped
implies
the
perception
no
longer
successive
but
simultaneous
of
a
and
and
that
it
would
be
a
contradiction
to
suppose
a
succession
which
was
only
a
succession
and
which
nevertheless
was
contained
in
one
and
the
same
instant
now
when
we
speak
of
an
of
succession
in
duration
and
of
the
reversibility
of
this
order
is
the
succession
we
are
dealing
with
pure
succession
such
as
we
have
just
defined
it
without
any
admixture
of
extensity
or
is
it
succession
developing
in
space
in
such
a
way
that
we
can
take
in
at
once
a
number
of
elements
which
are
both
distinct
and
set
side
by
side
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
answer
we
could
not
introduce
among
terms
without
first
distinguishing
them
and
then
comparing
the
places
which
they
occupy
hence
we
must
perceive
them
as
multiple
simultaneous
and
distinct
in
a
word
we
set
them
side
by
side
and
if
we
introduce
an
order
in
what
is
successive
the
reason
is
that
succession
is
converted
into
simultaneity
and
is
projected
into
space
in
short
when
the
movement
of
my
finger
along
a
surface
or
a
line
provides
me
with
a
series
of
sensations
of
different
qualities
one
of
two
things
happens
either
i
picture
these
sensations
to
myself
as
in
duration
only
and
in
that
case
they
succeed
one
another
in
such
a
way
that
i
can
not
at
a
given
moment
perceive
a
number
of
them
as
simultaneous
and
yet
distinct
or
else
i
make
out
an
order
of
succession
but
in
that
case
i
display
the
faculty
not
only
of
perceiving
a
succession
of
elements
but
also
of
setting
them
out
in
line
after
having
distinguished
them
in
a
word
i
already
possess
the
idea
of
space
hence
the
idea
of
a
reversible
series
in
duration
or
even
simply
of
a
certain
of
succession
in
time
itself
implies
the
representation
of
space
and
can
not
be
used
to
define
it
sidenote
succession
can
not
be
symbolized
as
a
line
without
introducing
the
idea
of
space
of
three
dimensions
to
give
this
argument
a
stricter
form
let
us
imagine
a
straight
line
of
unlimited
length
and
on
this
line
a
material
point
a
which
moves
if
this
point
were
conscious
of
itself
it
would
feel
itself
change
since
it
moves
it
would
perceive
a
succession
but
would
this
succession
assume
for
it
the
form
of
a
line
no
doubt
it
would
if
it
could
rise
so
to
speak
above
the
line
which
it
traverses
and
perceive
simultaneously
several
points
of
it
in
juxtaposition
but
by
doing
so
it
would
form
the
idea
of
space
and
it
is
in
space
and
not
in
pure
duration
that
it
would
see
displayed
the
changes
which
it
undergoes
we
here
put
our
finger
on
the
mistake
of
those
who
regard
pure
duration
as
something
similar
to
space
but
of
a
simpler
nature
they
are
fond
of
setting
psychic
states
side
by
side
of
forming
a
chain
or
a
line
of
them
and
do
not
imagine
that
they
are
introducing
into
this
operation
the
idea
of
space
properly
so
called
the
idea
of
space
in
its
totality
because
space
is
a
medium
of
three
dimensions
but
how
can
they
fail
to
notice
that
in
order
to
perceive
a
line
as
a
line
it
is
necessary
to
take
up
a
position
outside
it
to
take
account
of
the
void
which
surrounds
it
and
consequently
to
think
a
space
of
three
dimensions
if
our
conscious
point
a
does
not
yet
possess
the
idea
of
space
and
this
is
the
hypothesis
which
we
have
agreed
to
adopt
the
succession
of
states
through
which
it
passes
can
not
assume
for
it
the
form
of
a
line
but
its
sensations
will
add
themselves
dynamically
to
one
another
and
will
organize
themselves
like
the
successive
notes
of
a
tune
by
which
we
allow
ourselves
to
be
lulled
and
soothed
in
a
word
pure
duration
might
well
be
nothing
but
a
succession
of
qualitative
changes
which
melt
into
and
permeate
one
another
without
precise
outlines
without
any
tendency
to
externalize
themselves
in
relation
to
one
another
without
any
affiliation
with
number
it
would
be
pure
heterogeneity
but
for
the
present
we
shall
not
insist
upon
this
point
it
is
enough
for
us
to
have
shown
that
from
the
moment
when
you
attribute
the
least
homogeneity
to
duration
you
surreptitiously
introduce
space
sidenote
pure
duration
is
wholly
qualitative
it
can
not
be
measured
unless
symbolically
represented
in
space
it
is
true
that
we
count
successive
moments
of
duration
and
that
because
of
its
relations
with
number
time
at
first
seems
to
us
to
be
a
measurable
magnitude
just
like
space
but
there
is
here
an
important
distinction
to
be
made
i
say
that
a
minute
has
just
elapsed
and
i
mean
by
this
that
a
pendulum
beating
the
seconds
has
completed
sixty
oscillations
if
i
picture
these
sixty
oscillations
to
myself
all
at
once
by
a
single
mental
perception
i
exclude
by
hypothesis
the
idea
of
a
succession
i
do
not
think
of
sixty
strokes
which
succeed
one
another
but
of
sixty
points
on
a
fixed
line
each
one
of
which
symbolizes
so
to
speak
an
oscillation
of
the
pendulum
if
on
the
other
hand
i
wish
to
picture
these
sixty
oscillations
in
succession
but
without
altering
the
way
they
are
produced
in
space
i
shall
be
compelled
to
think
of
each
oscillation
to
the
exclusion
of
the
recollection
of
the
preceding
one
for
space
has
preserved
no
trace
of
it
but
by
doing
so
i
shall
condemn
myself
to
remain
for
ever
in
the
present
i
shall
give
up
the
attempt
to
think
a
succession
or
a
duration
now
if
finally
i
retain
the
recollection
of
the
preceding
oscillation
together
with
the
image
of
the
present
oscillation
one
of
two
things
will
happen
either
i
shall
set
the
two
images
side
by
side
and
we
then
fall
back
on
our
first
hypothesis
or
i
shall
perceive
one
in
the
other
each
permeating
the
other
and
organizing
themselves
like
the
notes
of
a
tune
so
as
to
form
what
we
shall
call
a
continuous
or
qualitative
multiplicity
with
no
resemblance
to
number
i
shall
thus
get
the
image
of
pure
duration
but
i
shall
have
entirely
got
rid
of
the
idea
of
a
homogeneous
medium
or
a
measurable
quantity
by
carefully
examining
our
consciousness
we
shall
recognize
that
it
proceeds
in
this
way
whenever
it
refrains
from
representing
duration
symbolically
when
the
regular
oscillations
of
the
pendulum
make
us
sleepy
is
it
the
last
sound
heard
the
last
movement
perceived
which
produces
this
effect
no
undoubtedly
not
for
why
then
should
not
the
first
have
done
the
same
is
it
the
recollection
of
the
preceding
sounds
or
movements
set
in
juxtaposition
to
the
last
one
but
this
same
recollection
if
it
is
later
on
set
in
juxtaposition
to
a
single
sound
or
movement
will
remain
without
effect
hence
we
must
admit
that
the
sounds
combined
with
one
another
and
acted
not
by
their
quantity
as
quantity
but
by
the
quality
which
their
quantity
exhibited
by
the
rhythmic
organization
of
the
whole
could
the
effect
of
a
slight
but
continuous
stimulation
be
understood
in
any
other
way
if
the
sensation
remained
always
the
same
it
would
continue
to
be
indefinitely
slight
and
indefinitely
bearable
but
the
fact
is
that
each
increase
of
stimulation
is
taken
up
into
the
preceding
stimulations
and
that
the
whole
produces
on
us
the
effect
of
a
musical
phrase
which
is
constantly
on
the
point
of
ending
and
constantly
altered
in
its
totality
by
the
addition
of
some
new
note
if
we
assert
that
it
is
always
the
sensation
the
reason
is
that
we
are
thinking
not
of
the
sensation
itself
but
of
its
objective
cause
situated
in
space
we
then
set
it
out
in
space
in
its
turn
and
in
place
of
an
organism
which
develops
in
place
of
changes
which
permeate
one
another
we
perceive
one
and
the
same
sensation
stretching
itself
out
lengthwise
so
to
speak
and
setting
itself
in
juxtaposition
to
itself
without
limit
pure
duration
that
which
consciousness
perceives
must
thus
be
reckoned
among
the
intensive
magnitudes
if
intensities
can
be
called
magnitudes
strictly
speaking
however
it
is
not
a
quantity
and
as
soon
as
we
try
to
measure
it
we
unwittingly
replace
it
by
space
sidenote
time
as
dealt
with
by
the
astronomer
and
the
physicist
does
indeed
to
be
measurable
and
therefore
homogeneous
but
we
find
it
extraordinarily
difficult
to
think
of
duration
in
its
original
purity
this
is
due
no
doubt
to
the
fact
that
we
do
not
alone
external
objects
it
seems
as
we
do
and
time
regarded
from
this
point
of
view
has
every
appearance
of
a
homogeneous
medium
not
only
do
the
moments
of
this
duration
seem
to
be
external
to
one
another
like
bodies
in
space
but
the
movement
perceived
by
our
senses
is
the
so
to
speak
palpable
sign
of
a
homogeneous
and
measurable
duration
nay
more
time
enters
into
the
formulae
of
mechanics
into
the
calculations
of
the
astronomer
and
even
of
the
physicist
under
the
form
of
a
quantity
we
measure
the
velocity
of
a
movement
implying
that
time
itself
is
a
magnitude
indeed
the
analysis
which
we
have
just
attempted
requires
to
be
completed
for
if
duration
properly
can
not
be
measured
what
is
it
that
is
measured
by
the
oscillations
of
the
pendulum
granted
that
inner
duration
perceived
by
consciousness
is
nothing
else
but
the
melting
of
states
of
consciousness
into
one
another
and
the
gradual
growth
of
the
ego
it
will
be
said
notwithstanding
that
the
time
which
the
astronomer
introduces
into
his
formulae
the
time
which
our
clocks
divide
into
equal
portions
this
time
at
least
is
something
different
it
must
be
a
measurable
and
therefore
homogeneous
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort
however
and
a
close
examination
will
dispel
this
last
illusion
sidenote
but
what
we
call
measuring
time
is
nothing
but
counting
simultaneities
the
clock
taken
as
an
illustration
when
i
follow
with
my
eyes
on
the
dial
of
a
clock
the
movement
of
the
hand
which
corresponds
to
the
oscillations
of
the
pendulum
i
do
not
measure
duration
as
seems
to
be
thought
i
merely
count
simultaneities
which
is
very
different
outside
of
me
in
space
there
is
never
more
than
a
single
position
of
the
hand
and
the
pendulum
for
nothing
is
left
of
the
past
positions
within
myself
a
process
of
organization
or
interpenetration
of
conscious
states
is
going
on
which
constitutes
true
duration
it
is
because
i
in
this
way
that
i
picture
to
myself
what
i
call
the
past
oscillations
of
the
pendulum
at
the
same
time
as
i
perceive
the
present
oscillation
now
let
us
withdraw
for
a
moment
the
ego
which
thinks
these
successive
oscillations
there
will
never
be
more
than
a
single
oscillation
and
indeed
only
a
single
position
of
the
pendulum
and
hence
no
duration
withdraw
on
the
other
hand
the
pendulum
and
its
oscillations
there
will
no
longer
be
anything
but
the
heterogeneous
duration
of
the
ego
without
moments
external
to
one
another
without
relation
to
number
thus
within
our
ego
there
is
succession
without
mutual
externality
outside
the
ego
in
pure
space
mutual
externality
without
succession
mutual
externality
since
the
present
oscillation
is
radically
distinct
from
the
previous
oscillation
which
no
longer
exists
but
no
succession
since
succession
exists
solely
for
a
conscious
spectator
who
keeps
the
past
in
mind
and
sets
the
two
oscillations
or
their
symbols
side
by
side
in
an
auxiliary
space
now
between
this
succession
without
externality
and
this
externality
without
succession
a
kind
of
exchange
takes
place
very
similar
to
what
physicists
call
the
phenomenon
of
endosmosis
as
the
successive
phases
of
our
conscious
life
although
interpenetrating
correspond
individually
to
an
oscillation
of
the
pendulum
which
occurs
at
the
same
time
and
as
moreover
these
oscillations
are
sharply
distinguished
from
one
another
we
get
into
the
habit
of
setting
up
the
same
distinction
between
the
successive
moments
of
our
conscious
life
the
oscillations
of
the
pendulum
break
it
up
so
to
speak
into
parts
external
to
one
another
hence
the
mistaken
idea
of
a
homogeneous
inner
duration
similar
to
space
the
moments
of
which
are
identical
and
follow
without
penetrating
one
another
but
on
the
other
hand
the
oscillations
of
the
pendulum
which
are
distinct
only
because
one
has
disappeared
when
the
other
appears
on
the
scene
profit
as
it
were
from
the
influence
which
they
have
thus
exercised
over
our
conscious
life
owing
to
the
fact
that
our
consciousness
has
organized
them
as
a
whole
in
memory
they
are
first
preserved
and
afterwards
disposed
in
a
series
in
a
word
we
create
for
them
a
fourth
dimension
of
space
which
we
call
homogeneous
time
and
which
enables
the
movement
of
the
pendulum
although
taking
place
at
one
spot
to
be
continually
set
in
juxtaposition
to
itself
now
if
we
try
to
determine
the
exact
part
played
by
the
real
and
the
imaginary
in
this
very
complex
process
this
is
what
we
find
there
is
a
real
space
without
duration
in
which
phenomena
appear
and
disappear
simultaneously
with
our
states
of
consciousness
there
is
a
real
duration
the
heterogeneous
moments
of
which
permeate
one
another
each
moment
however
can
be
brought
into
relation
with
a
state
of
the
external
world
which
is
contemporaneous
with
it
and
can
be
separated
from
the
other
moments
in
consequence
of
this
very
process
the
comparison
of
these
two
realities
gives
rise
to
a
symbolical
representation
of
duration
derived
from
space
duration
thus
assumes
the
illusory
form
of
a
homogeneous
medium
and
the
connecting
link
between
these
two
terms
space
and
duration
is
simultaneity
which
might
be
defined
as
the
intersection
of
time
and
space
sidenote
two
elements
in
motion
the
space
traversed
which
is
homogeneous
and
divisible
the
act
of
traversing
indivisible
and
real
only
for
consciousness
if
we
analyse
in
the
same
way
the
concept
of
motion
the
living
symbol
of
this
seemingly
homogeneous
duration
we
shall
be
led
to
make
a
distinction
of
the
same
kind
we
generally
say
that
a
movement
takes
place
space
and
when
we
assert
that
motion
is
homogeneous
and
divisible
it
is
of
the
space
traversed
that
we
are
thinking
as
if
it
were
interchangeable
with
the
motion
itself
now
if
we
reflect
further
we
shall
see
that
the
successive
positions
of
the
moving
body
really
do
occupy
space
but
that
the
process
by
which
it
passes
from
one
position
to
the
other
a
process
which
occupies
duration
and
which
has
no
reality
except
for
a
conscious
spectator
eludes
space
we
have
to
do
here
not
with
an
but
with
a
motion
in
so
far
as
it
is
a
passage
from
one
point
to
another
is
a
mental
synthesis
a
psychic
and
therefore
unextended
process
space
contains
only
parts
of
space
and
at
whatever
point
of
space
we
consider
the
moving
body
we
shall
get
only
a
position
if
consciousness
is
aware
of
anything
more
than
positions
the
reason
is
that
it
keeps
the
successive
positions
in
mind
and
synthesizes
them
but
how
does
it
carry
out
a
synthesis
of
this
kind
it
can
not
be
by
a
fresh
setting
out
of
these
same
positions
in
a
homogeneous
medium
for
a
fresh
synthesis
would
be
necessary
to
connect
the
positions
with
one
another
and
so
on
indefinitely
we
are
thus
compelled
to
admit
that
we
have
here
to
do
with
a
synthesis
which
is
so
to
speak
qualitative
a
gradual
organization
of
our
successive
sensations
a
unity
resembling
that
of
a
phrase
in
a
melody
this
is
just
the
idea
of
motion
which
we
form
when
we
think
of
it
by
itself
when
so
to
speak
from
motion
we
extract
mobility
think
of
what
you
experience
on
suddenly
perceiving
a
shooting
star
in
this
extremely
rapid
motion
there
is
a
natural
and
instinctive
separation
between
the
space
traversed
which
appears
to
you
under
the
form
of
a
line
of
fire
and
the
absolutely
indivisible
sensation
of
motion
or
mobility
a
rapid
gesture
made
with
one
eyes
shut
will
assume
for
consciousness
the
form
of
a
purely
qualitative
sensation
as
long
as
there
is
no
thought
of
the
space
traversed
in
a
word
there
are
two
elements
to
be
distinguished
in
motion
the
space
traversed
and
the
act
by
which
we
traverse
it
the
successive
positions
and
the
synthesis
of
these
positions
the
first
of
these
elements
is
a
homogeneous
quantity
the
second
has
no
reality
except
in
a
consciousness
it
is
a
quality
or
an
intensity
whichever
you
prefer
but
here
again
we
meet
with
a
case
of
endosmosis
an
intermingling
of
the
purely
intensive
sensation
of
mobility
with
the
extensive
representation
of
the
space
traversed
on
the
one
hand
we
attribute
to
the
motion
the
divisibility
of
the
space
which
it
traverses
forgetting
that
it
is
quite
possible
to
divide
an
but
not
an
and
on
the
other
hand
we
accustom
ourselves
to
projecting
this
act
itself
into
space
to
applying
it
to
the
whole
of
the
line
which
the
moving
body
traverses
in
a
word
to
solidifying
it
as
if
this
localizing
of
a
in
space
did
not
amount
to
asserting
that
even
outside
consciousness
the
past
along
with
the
present
sidenote
the
common
confusion
between
motion
and
the
space
traversed
gives
rise
to
the
paradoxes
of
the
eleatics
it
is
to
this
confusion
between
motion
and
the
space
traversed
that
the
paradoxes
of
the
eleatics
are
due
for
the
interval
which
separates
two
points
is
infinitely
divisible
and
if
motion
consisted
of
parts
like
those
of
the
interval
itself
the
interval
would
never
be
crossed
but
the
truth
is
that
each
of
achilles
steps
is
a
simple
indivisible
act
and
that
after
a
given
number
of
these
acts
achilles
will
have
passed
the
tortoise
the
mistake
of
the
eleatics
arises
from
their
identification
of
this
series
of
acts
each
of
which
is
a
definite
and
with
the
homogeneous
space
which
underlies
them
as
this
space
can
be
divided
and
put
together
again
according
to
any
law
whatever
they
think
they
are
justified
in
reconstructing
achilles
whole
movement
not
with
achilles
kind
of
step
but
with
the
tortoise
kind
in
place
of
achilles
pursuing
the
tortoise
they
really
put
two
tortoises
regulated
by
each
other
two
tortoises
which
agree
to
make
the
same
kind
of
steps
or
simultaneous
acts
so
as
never
to
catch
one
another
why
does
achilles
outstrip
the
tortoise
because
each
of
achilles
steps
and
each
of
the
tortoise
steps
are
indivisible
acts
in
so
far
as
they
are
movements
and
are
different
magnitudes
in
so
far
as
they
are
space
so
that
addition
will
soon
give
a
greater
length
for
the
space
traversed
by
achilles
than
is
obtained
by
adding
together
the
space
traversed
by
the
tortoise
and
the
handicap
with
which
it
started
this
is
what
zeno
leaves
out
of
account
when
he
reconstructs
the
movement
of
achilles
according
to
the
same
law
as
the
movement
of
the
tortoise
forgetting
that
space
alone
can
be
divided
and
put
together
again
in
any
way
we
like
and
thus
confusing
space
with
motion
hence
we
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
admit
even
after
the
acute
and
profound
analysis
of
a
contemporary
thinker
that
the
meeting
of
the
two
moving
bodies
implies
a
discrepancy
between
real
and
imaginary
motion
between
in
and
indefinitely
divisible
space
between
concrete
time
and
abstract
time
why
resort
to
a
metaphysical
hypothesis
however
ingenious
about
the
nature
of
space
time
and
motion
when
immediate
intuition
shows
us
motion
within
duration
and
duration
outside
space
there
is
no
need
to
assume
a
limit
to
the
divisibility
of
concrete
space
we
can
admit
that
it
is
infinitely
divisible
provided
that
we
make
a
distinction
between
the
simultaneous
positions
of
the
two
moving
bodies
which
are
in
fact
in
space
and
their
movements
which
can
not
occupy
space
being
duration
rather
than
extent
quality
and
not
quantity
to
measure
the
velocity
of
a
movement
as
we
shall
see
is
simply
to
ascertain
a
simultaneity
to
introduce
this
velocity
into
calculations
is
simply
to
use
a
convenient
means
of
anticipating
a
simultaneity
thus
mathematics
confines
itself
to
its
own
province
as
long
as
it
is
occupied
with
determining
the
simultaneous
positions
of
achilles
and
the
tortoise
at
a
given
moment
or
when
it
admits
that
the
two
moving
bodies
meet
at
a
point
a
meeting
which
is
itself
a
simultaneity
but
it
goes
beyond
its
province
when
it
claims
to
reconstruct
what
takes
place
in
the
interval
between
two
simultaneities
or
rather
it
is
inevitably
led
even
then
to
consider
simultaneities
once
more
fresh
simultaneities
the
indefinitely
increasing
number
of
which
ought
to
be
a
warning
that
we
can
not
make
movement
out
of
immobilities
nor
time
out
of
space
in
short
just
as
nothing
will
be
found
homogeneous
in
duration
except
a
symbolical
medium
with
no
duration
at
all
namely
space
in
which
simultaneities
are
set
out
in
line
in
the
same
way
no
homogeneous
element
will
be
found
in
motion
except
that
which
least
belongs
to
it
the
traversed
space
which
is

science
has
to
eliminate
duration
from
time
and
mobility
from
motion
before
it
can
deal
with
them
now
just
for
this
reason
science
can
not
deal
with
time
and
motion
except
on
condition
of
first
eliminating
the
essential
and
qualitative
element
of
time
duration
and
of
motion
mobility
we
may
easily
convince
ourselves
of
this
by
examining
the
part
played
in
astronomy
and
mechanics
by
considerations
of
time
motion
and
velocity
treatises
on
mechanics
are
careful
to
announce
that
they
do
not
intend
to
define
duration
itself
but
only
the
equality
of
two
durations
two
intervals
of
time
are
equal
when
two
identical
bodies
in
identical
conditions
at
the
beginning
of
each
of
these
intervals
and
subject
to
the
same
actions
and
influences
of
every
kind
have
traversed
the
same
space
at
the
end
of
these
intervals
in
other
words
we
are
to
note
the
exact
moment
at
which
the
motion
begins
the
coincidence
of
an
external
change
with
one
of
our
psychic
states
we
are
to
note
the
moment
at
which
the
motion
ends
that
is
to
say
another
simultaneity
finally
we
are
to
measure
the
space
traversed
the
only
thing
in
fact
which
is
really
measurable
hence
there
is
no
question
here
of
duration
but
only
of
space
and
simultaneities
to
announce
that
something
will
take
place
at
the
end
of
a
time
is
to
declare
that
consciousness
will
note
between
now
and
then
a
number
of
simultaneities
of
a
certain
kind
and
we
must
not
be
led
astray
by
the
words
between
now
and
then
for
the
interval
of
duration
exists
only
for
us
and
on
account
of
the
interpenetration
of
our
conscious
states
outside
ourselves
we
should
find
only
space
and
consequently
nothing
but
simultaneities
of
which
we
could
not
even
say
that
they
are
objectively
successive
since
succession
can
only
be
thought
through
the
present
with
the
that
the
interval
of
duration
itself
can
not
be
taken
into
account
by
science
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
if
all
the
motions
of
the
universe
took
place
twice
or
thrice
as
quickly
there
would
be
nothing
to
alter
either
in
our
formulae
or
in
the
figures
which
are
to
be
found
in
them
consciousness
would
have
an
indefinable
and
as
it
were
qualitative
impression
of
the
change
but
the
change
would
not
make
itself
felt
outside
consciousness
since
the
same
number
of
simultaneities
would
go
on
taking
place
in
space
we
shall
see
later
on
that
when
the
astronomer
predicts
an
eclipse
he
does
something
of
this
kind
he
shortens
infinitely
the
intervals
of
duration
as
these
do
not
count
for
science
and
thus
perceives
in
a
very
short
time
a
few
seconds
at
the
most
a
succession
of
simultaneities
which
may
take
up
several
centuries
for
the
concrete
consciousness
compelled
to
live
through
the
intervals
instead
of
merely
counting
their
extremities
sidenote
this
is
seen
in
the
definition
of
a
direct
analysis
of
the
notion
of
velocity
will
bring
us
to
the
same
conclusion
mechanics
gets
this
notion
through
a
series
of
ideas
the
connexion
of
which
it
is
easy
enough
to
trace
it
first
builds
up
the
idea
of
uniform
motion
by
picturing
on
the
one
hand
the
path
ab
of
a
certain
moving
body
and
on
the
other
a
physical
phenomenon
which
is
repeated
indefinitely
under
the
same
conditions
a
stone
always
falling
from
the
same
height
on
to
the
same
spot
if
we
mark
on
the
path
ab
the
points
m
ν
p
reached
by
the
moving
body
at
each
of
the
moments
when
the
stone
touches
the
ground
and
if
the
intervals
am
mn
and
np
are
found
to
be
equal
to
one
another
the
motion
will
be
said
to
be
uniform
and
any
one
of
these
intervals
will
be
called
the
velocity
of
the
moving
body
provided
that
it
is
agreed
to
adopt
as
unit
of
duration
the
physical
phenomenon
which
has
been
chosen
as
the
term
of
comparison
thus
the
velocity
of
a
uniform
motion
is
defined
by
mechanics
without
appealing
to
any
other
notions
than
those
of
space
and
simultaneity
now
let
us
turn
to
the
case
of
a
variable
motion
that
is
to
the
case
when
the
elements
am
mn
np
are
found
to
be
unequal
in
order
to
define
the
velocity
of
the
moving
body
a
at
the
point
m
we
shall
only
have
to
imagine
an
unlimited
number
of
moving
bodies
all
moving
uniformly
with
velocities
which
are
arranged
in
an
ascending
scale
and
which
correspond
to
all
possible
magnitudes
let
us
then
consider
on
the
path
of
the
moving
body
two
points
m
and
m
situated
on
either
side
of
the
point
m
but
very
near
it
at
the
same
time
as
this
moving
body
reaches
the
points
m
m
m
the
other
moving
bodies
reach
points
m
m
on
their
respective
paths
and
there
must
be
two
moving
bodies
ah
and
ap
such
that
we
have
on
the
one
hand
m
and
on
the
other
hand
m
m
m
we
shall
then
agree
to
say
that
the
velocity
of
the
moving
body
a
at
the
point
m
lies
between
and
but
nothing
prevents
our
assuming
that
the
points
m
and
m
are
still
nearer
the
point
m
and
it
will
then
be
necessary
to
replace
and
by
two
fresh
velocities
and
the
one
greater
than
and
the
other
less
than
and
in
proportion
as
we
reduce
the
two
intervals
and
mm
we
shall
lessen
the
difference
between
the
velocities
of
the
uniform
corresponding
movements
now
the
two
intervals
being
capable
of
decreasing
right
down
to
zero
there
evidently
exists
between
and
a
certain
velocity
such
that
the
difference
between
this
velocity
and
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
can
become
smaller
than
any
given
quantity
it
is
this
common
limit
which
we
shall
call
the
velocity
of
the
moving
body
a
at
the
point
now
in
this
analysis
of
variable
motion
as
in
that
of
uniform
motion
it
is
a
question
only
of
spaces
once
traversed
and
of
simultaneous
positions
once
reached
we
were
thus
justified
in
saying
that
while
all
that
mechanics
retains
of
time
is
simultaneity
all
that
it
retains
of
motion
itself
restricted
as
it
is
to
a
of
motion
is
immobility
characters
preceded
by
are
in
subscript
in
original
sidenote
mechanics
deals
with
equations
which
express
something
finished
and
not
processes
such
as
duration
and
motion
this
result
might
have
been
foreseen
by
noticing
that
mechanics
necessarily
deals
with
equations
and
that
an
algebraic
equation
always
expresses
something
already
done
now
it
is
of
the
very
essence
of
duration
and
motion
as
they
appear
to
our
consciousness
to
be
something
that
is
unceasingly
being
done
thus
algebra
can
represent
the
results
gained
at
a
certain
moment
of
duration
and
the
positions
occupied
by
a
certain
moving
body
in
space
but
not
duration
and
motion
themselves
mathematics
may
indeed
increase
the
number
of
simultaneities
and
positions
which
it
takes
into
consideration
by
making
the
intervals
very
small
it
may
even
by
using
the
differential
instead
of
the
difference
show
that
it
is
possible
to
increase
without
limit
the
number
of
these
intervals
of
duration
nevertheless
however
small
the
interval
is
supposed
to
be
it
is
the
extremity
of
the
interval
at
which
mathematics
always
places
itself
as
for
the
interval
itself
as
for
the
duration
and
the
motion
they
are
necessarily
left
out
of
the
equation
the
reason
is
that
duration
and
motion
are
mental
syntheses
and
not
objects
that
although
the
moving
body
occupies
one
after
the
other
points
on
a
line
motion
itself
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
line
and
finally
that
although
the
positions
occupied
by
the
moving
body
vary
with
the
different
moments
of
duration
though
it
even
creates
distinct
moments
by
the
mere
fact
of
occupying
different
positions
duration
properly
so
called
has
no
moments
which
are
identical
or
external
to
one
another
being
essentially
heterogeneous
continuous
and
with
no
analogy
to
number
sidenote
conclusion
space
alone
is
homogeneous
duration
and
succession
belong
not
to
the
external
world
but
to
the
conscious
mind
it
follows
from
this
analysis
that
space
alone
is
homogeneous
that
objects
in
space
form
a
discrete
multiplicity
and
that
every
discrete
multiplicity
is
got
by
a
process
of
unfolding
in
space
it
also
follows
that
there
is
neither
duration
nor
even
succession
in
space
if
we
give
to
these
words
the
meaning
in
which
consciousness
takes
them
each
of
the
successive
states
of
the
external
world
exists
alone
their
multiplicity
is
real
only
for
a
consciousness
that
can
first
retain
them
and
then
set
them
side
by
side
by
externalizing
them
in
relation
to
one
another
if
it
retains
them
it
is
because
these
distinct
states
of
the
external
world
give
rise
to
states
of
consciousness
which
permeate
one
another
imperceptibly
organize
themselves
into
a
whole
and
bind
the
past
to
the
present
by
this
very
process
of
connexion
if
it
externalizes
them
in
relation
to
one
another
the
reason
is
that
thinking
of
their
radical
distinctness
the
one
having
ceased
to
be
when
the
other
appears
on
the
scene
it
perceives
them
under
the
form
of
a
discrete
multiplicity
which
amounts
to
setting
them
out
in
line
in
the
space
in
which
each
of
them
existed
separately
the
space
employed
for
this
purpose
is
just
that
which
is
called
homogeneous
time
sidenote
two
kinds
of
multiplicity
two
senses
of
the
word
distinguish
the
one
qualitative
and
the
other
quantitative
but
another
conclusion
results
from
this
analysis
namely
that
the
multiplicity
of
conscious
states
regarded
in
its
original
purity
is
not
at
all
like
the
discrete
multiplicity
which
goes
to
form
a
number
in
such
a
case
there
is
as
we
said
a
qualitative
multiplicity
in
short
we
must
admit
two
kinds
of
multiplicity
two
possible
senses
of
the
word
distinguish
two
conceptions
the
one
qualitative
and
the
other
quantitative
of
the
difference
between
and
sometimes
this
multiplicity
this
distinctness
this
heterogeneity
contains
number
only
potentially
as
aristotle
would
have
said
consciousness
then
makes
a
qualitative
discrimination
without
any
further
thought
of
counting
the
qualities
or
even
of
distinguishing
them
as
in
such
a
case
we
have
multiplicity
without
quantity
sometimes
on
the
other
hand
it
is
a
question
of
a
multiplicity
of
terms
which
are
counted
or
which
are
conceived
as
capable
of
being
counted
but
we
think
then
of
the
possibility
of
externalizing
them
in
relation
to
one
another
we
set
them
out
in
space
unfortunately
we
are
so
accustomed
to
illustrate
one
of
these
two
meanings
of
the
same
word
by
the
other
and
even
to
perceive
the
one
in
the
other
that
we
find
it
extraordinarily
difficult
to
distinguish
between
them
or
at
least
to
express
this
distinction
in
words
thus
i
said
that
several
conscious
states
are
organized
into
a
whole
permeate
one
another
gradually
gain
a
richer
content
and
might
thus
give
any
one
ignorant
of
space
the
feeling
of
pure
duration
but
the
very
use
of
the
word
several
shows
that
i
had
already
isolated
these
states
externalized
them
in
relation
to
one
another
and
in
a
word
set
them
side
by
side
thus
by
the
very
language
which
i
was
compelled
to
use
i
betrayed
the
deeply
ingrained
habit
of
setting
out
time
in
space
from
this
spatial
setting
out
already
accomplished
we
are
compelled
to
borrow
the
terms
which
we
use
to
describe
the
state
of
a
mind
which
has
not
yet
accomplished
it
these
terms
are
thus
misleading
from
the
very
beginning
and
the
idea
of
a
multiplicity
without
relation
to
number
or
space
although
clear
for
pure
reflective
thought
can
not
be
translated
into
the
language
of
common
sense
and
yet
we
can
not
even
form
the
idea
of
discrete
multiplicity
without
considering
at
the
same
time
a
qualitative
multiplicity
when
we
explicitly
count
units
by
stringing
them
along
a
spatial
line
is
it
not
the
case
that
alongside
this
addition
of
identical
terms
standing
out
from
a
homogeneous
background
an
organization
of
these
units
is
going
on
in
the
depths
of
the
soul
a
wholly
dynamic
process
not
unlike
the
purely
qualitative
way
in
which
an
anvil
if
it
could
feel
would
realize
a
series
of
blows
from
a
hammer
in
this
sense
we
might
almost
say
that
the
numbers
in
daily
use
have
each
their
emotional
equivalent
tradesmen
are
well
aware
of
it
and
instead
of
indicating
the
price
of
an
object
by
a
round
number
of
shillings
they
will
mark
the
next
smaller
number
leaving
themselves
to
insert
afterwards
a
sufficient
number
of
pence
and
farthings
in
a
word
the
process
by
which
we
count
units
and
make
them
into
a
discrete
multiplicity
has
two
sides
on
the
one
hand
we
assume
that
they
are
identical
which
is
conceivable
only
on
condition
that
these
units
are
ranged
alongside
each
other
in
a
homogeneous
medium
but
on
the
other
hand
the
third
unit
for
example
when
added
to
the
other
two
alters
the
nature
the
appearance
and
as
it
were
the
rhythm
of
the
whole
without
this
interpenetration
and
this
so
to
speak
qualitative
progress
no
addition
would
be
possible
hence
it
is
through
the
quality
of
quantity
that
we
form
the
idea
of
quantity
without
quality
sidenote
our
successive
sensations
are
regarded
as
mutually
external
like
their
objective
causes
and
this
reacts
on
our
deeper
psychic
life
it
is
therefore
obvious
that
if
it
did
not
betake
itself
to
a
symbolical
substitute
our
consciousness
our
successive
would
never
regard
time
as
a
homogeneous
medium
in
which
the
terms
of
a
succession
remain
outside
one
another
but
we
naturally
reach
this
symbolical
representation
by
the
mere
fact
that
in
a
series
of
identical
terms
each
term
assumes
a
double
aspect
for
our
consciousness
one
aspect
which
is
the
same
for
all
of
them
since
we
are
thinking
then
of
the
sameness
of
the
external
object
and
another
aspect
which
is
characteristic
of
each
of
them
because
the
supervening
of
each
term
brings
about
a
new
organization
of
the
whole
hence
the
possibility
of
setting
out
in
space
under
the
form
of
numerical
multiplicity
what
we
have
called
a
qualitative
multiplicity
and
of
regarding
the
one
as
the
equivalent
of
the
other
now
this
twofold
process
is
nowhere
accomplished
so
easily
as
in
the
perception
of
the
external
phenomenon
which
takes
for
us
the
form
of
motion
here
we
certainly
have
a
series
of
identical
terms
since
it
is
always
the
same
moving
body
but
on
the
other
hand
the
synthesis
carried
out
by
our
consciousness
between
the
actual
position
and
what
our
memory
calls
the
former
positions
causes
these
images
to
permeate
complete
and
so
to
speak
continue
one
another
hence
it
is
principally
by
the
help
of
motion
that
duration
assumes
the
form
of
a
homogeneous
medium
and
that
time
is
projected
into
space
but
even
if
we
leave
out
motion
any
repetition
of
a
external
phenomenon
would
suggest
to
consciousness
the
same
mode
of
representation
thus
when
we
hear
a
series
of
blows
of
a
hammer
the
sounds
form
an
indivisible
melody
in
so
far
as
they
are
pure
sensations
and
here
again
give
rise
to
a
dynamic
progress
but
knowing
that
the
same
objective
cause
is
at
work
we
cut
up
this
progress
into
phases
which
we
then
regard
as
identical
and
this
multiplicity
of
elements
no
longer
being
conceivable
except
by
being
set
out
in
space
since
they
have
now
become
identical
we
are
necessarily
led
to
the
idea
of
a
homogeneous
time
the
symbolical
image
of
real
duration
in
a
word
our
ego
comes
in
contact
with
the
external
world
at
its
surface
our
successive
sensations
although
dissolving
into
one
another
retain
something
of
the
mutual
externality
which
belongs
to
their
objective
causes
and
thus
our
superficial
psychic
life
comes
to
be
pictured
without
any
great
effort
as
set
out
in
a
homogeneous
medium
but
the
symbolical
character
of
such
a
picture
becomes
more
striking
as
we
advance
further
into
the
depths
of
consciousness
the
self
which
ponders
and
decides
which
heats
and
blazes
up
is
a
self
whose
states
and
changes
permeate
one
another
and
undergo
a
deep
alteration
as
soon
as
we
separate
them
from
one
another
in
order
to
set
them
out
in
space
but
as
this
deeper
self
forms
one
and
the
same
person
with
the
superficial
ego
the
two
seem
to
in
the
same
way
and
as
the
repeated
picture
of
one
identical
objective
phenomenon
ever
recurring
cuts
up
our
superficial
psychic
life
into
parts
external
to
one
another
the
moments
which
are
thus
determined
determine
in
their
turn
distinct
segments
in
the
dynamic
and
undivided
progress
of
our
more
personal
conscious
states
thus
the
mutual
externality
which
material
objects
gain
from
their
juxtaposition
in
homogeneous
space
reverberates
and
spreads
into
the
depths
of
consciousness
little
by
little
our
sensations
are
distinguished
from
one
another
like
the
external
causes
which
gave
rise
to
them
and
our
feelings
or
ideas
come
to
be
separated
like
the
sensations
with
which
they
are
contemporaneous
sidenote
eliminate
the
superficial
psychic
states
and
we
no
longer
perceive
a
homogeneous
time
or
measure
duration
but
feel
it
as
a
quality
that
our
ordinary
conception
of
duration
depends
on
a
gradual
incursion
of
space
into
the
domain
of
pure
consciousness
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
in
order
to
deprive
the
ego
of
the
faculty
of
perceiving
a
homogeneous
time
it
is
enough
to
take
away
from
it
this
outer
circle
of
psychic
states
which
it
uses
as
a
these
conditions
are
realized
when
we
dream
for
sleep
by
relaxing
the
play
of
the
organic
functions
alters
the
communicating
surface
between
the
ego
and
external
objects
here
we
no
longer
measure
duration
but
we
feel
it
from
quantity
it
returns
to
the
state
of
quality
we
no
longer
estimate
past
time
mathematically
the
mathematical
estimate
gives
place
to
a
confused
instinct
capable
like
all
instincts
of
committing
gross
errors
but
also
of
acting
at
times
with
extraordinary
skill
even
in
the
waking
state
daily
experience
ought
to
teach
us
to
distinguish
between
duration
as
quality
that
which
consciousness
reaches
immediately
and
which
is
probably
what
animals
perceive
and
time
so
to
speak
materialized
time
that
has
become
quantity
by
being
set
out
in
space
whilst
i
am
writing
these
lines
the
hour
strikes
on
a
neighbouring
clock
but
my
inattentive
ear
does
not
perceive
it
until
several
strokes
have
made
themselves
heard
hence
i
have
not
counted
them
and
yet
i
only
have
to
turn
my
attention
backwards
to
count
up
the
four
strokes
which
have
already
sounded
and
add
them
to
those
which
i
hear
if
then
i
question
myself
carefully
on
what
has
just
taken
place
i
perceive
that
the
first
four
sounds
had
struck
my
ear
and
even
affected
my
consciousness
but
that
the
sensations
produced
by
each
one
of
them
instead
of
being
set
side
by
side
had
melted
into
one
another
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
the
whole
a
peculiar
quality
to
make
a
kind
of
musical
phrase
out
of
it
in
order
then
to
estimate
retrospectively
the
number
of
strokes
sounded
i
tried
to
reconstruct
this
phrase
in
thought
my
imagination
made
one
stroke
then
two
then
three
and
as
long
as
it
did
not
reach
the
exact
number
four
my
feeling
when
consulted
answered
that
the
total
effect
was
qualitatively
different
it
had
thus
ascertained
in
its
own
way
the
succession
of
four
strokes
but
quite
otherwise
than
by
a
process
of
addition
and
without
bringing
in
the
image
of
a
juxtaposition
of
distinct
terms
in
a
word
the
number
of
strokes
was
perceived
as
a
quality
and
not
as
a
quantity
it
is
thus
that
duration
is
presented
to
immediate
consciousness
and
it
retains
this
form
so
long
as
it
does
not
give
place
to
a
symbolical
representation
derived
from
extensity
sidenote
there
are
therefore
two
forms
of
multiplicity
of
duration
and
conscious
life
we
should
therefore
distinguish
two
forms
of
multiplicity
two
very
different
ways
of
regarding
duration
two
aspects
of
conscious
life
below
homogeneous
duration
which
is
the
extensive
symbol
of
true
duration
a
close
psychological
analysis
distinguishes
a
duration
whose
heterogeneous
moments
permeate
one
another
below
the
numerical
multiplicity
of
conscious
states
a
qualitative
multiplicity
below
the
self
with
states
a
self
in
which
each
means
into
one
and
forming
an
organic
whole
but
we
are
generally
content
with
the
first
with
the
shadow
of
the
self
projected
into
homogeneous
space
consciousness
goaded
by
an
insatiable
desire
to
separate
substitutes
the
symbol
for
the
reality
or
perceives
the
reality
only
through
the
symbol
as
the
self
thus
refracted
and
thereby
broken
to
pieces
is
much
better
adapted
to
the
requirements
of
social
life
in
general
and
language
in
particular
consciousness
prefers
it
and
gradually
loses
sight
of
the
fundamental
self
sidenote
the
two
aspects
of
our
conscious
states
in
order
to
recover
this
fundamental
self
as
the
unsophisticated
consciousness
would
perceive
it
a
vigorous
effort
of
analysis
is
necessary
which
will
isolate
the
fluid
inner
states
from
their
image
first
refracted
then
solidified
in
homogeneous
space
in
other
words
our
perceptions
sensations
emotions
and
ideas
occur
under
two
aspects
the
one
clear
and
precise
but
impersonal
the
other
confused
ever
changing
and
inexpressible
because
language
can
not
get
hold
of
it
without
arresting
its
mobility
or
fit
it
into
its
forms
without
making
it
into
public
property
if
we
have
been
led
to
distinguish
two
forms
of
multiplicity
two
forms
of
duration
we
must
expect
each
conscious
state
taken
by
itself
to
assume
a
different
aspect
according
as
we
consider
it
within
a
discrete
multiplicity
or
a
confused
multiplicity
in
the
time
as
quality
in
which
it
is
produced
or
in
the
time
as
quantity
into
which
it
is
projected
sidenote
one
of
which
is
due
to
the
solidifying
influence
of
external
objects
and
language
on
our
constantly
changing
feelings
when
i
take
my
first
walk
in
a
town
in
which
i
am
going
to
live
my
environment
produces
on
me
two
impressions
at
the
same
time
one
of
which
is
destined
to
last
while
the
other
will
constantly
change
every
day
i
perceive
the
same
houses
and
as
i
know
that
they
are
the
same
objects
i
always
call
them
by
the
same
name
and
i
also
fancy
that
they
always
look
the
same
to
me
but
if
i
recur
at
the
end
of
a
sufficiently
long
period
to
the
impression
which
i
experienced
during
the
first
few
years
i
am
surprised
at
the
remarkable
inexplicable
and
indeed
inexpressible
change
which
has
taken
place
it
seems
that
these
objects
continually
perceived
by
me
and
constantly
impressing
themselves
on
my
mind
have
ended
by
borrowing
from
me
something
of
my
own
conscious
existence
like
myself
they
have
lived
and
like
myself
they
have
grown
old
this
is
not
a
mere
illusion
for
if
impression
were
absolutely
identical
with
that
of
yesterday
what
difference
would
there
be
between
perceiving
and
recognizing
between
learning
and
remembering
yet
this
difference
escapes
the
attention
of
most
of
us
we
shall
hardly
perceive
it
unless
we
are
warned
of
it
and
then
carefully
look
into
ourselves
the
reason
is
that
our
outer
and
so
to
speak
social
life
is
more
practically
important
to
us
than
our
inner
and
individual
existence
we
instinctively
tend
to
solidify
our
impressions
in
order
to
express
them
in
language
hence
we
confuse
the
feeling
itself
which
is
in
a
perpetual
state
of
becoming
with
its
permanent
external
object
and
especially
with
the
word
which
expresses
this
object
in
the
same
way
as
the
fleeting
duration
of
our
ego
is
fixed
by
its
projection
in
homogeneous
space
our
constantly
changing
impressions
wrapping
themselves
round
the
external
object
which
is
their
cause
take
on
its
definite
outlines
and
its
immobility
sidenote
how
language
gives
a
fixed
form
to
fleeting
sensations
our
simple
sensations
taken
in
their
natural
state
are
still
more
fleeting
such
and
such
a
flavour
such
and
such
a
scent
pleased
me
when
i
was
a
child
though
i
dislike
them
yet
i
still
give
the
same
name
to
the
sensation
experienced
and
i
speak
as
if
only
my
taste
had
changed
whilst
the
scent
and
the
flavour
have
remained
the
same
thus
i
again
solidify
the
sensation
and
when
its
changeableness
becomes
so
obvious
that
i
can
not
help
recognizing
it
i
abstract
this
changeableness
to
give
it
a
name
of
its
own
and
solidify
it
in
the
shape
of
a
but
in
reality
there
are
neither
identical
sensations
nor
multiple
tastes
for
sensations
and
tastes
seem
to
me
to
be
as
soon
as
i
isolate
and
name
them
and
in
the
human
soul
there
are
only
what
i
ought
to
say
is
that
every
sensation
is
altered
by
repetition
and
that
if
it
does
not
seem
to
me
to
change
from
day
to
day
it
is
because
i
perceive
it
through
the
object
which
is
its
cause
through
the
word
which
translates
it
this
influence
of
language
on
sensation
is
deeper
than
is
usually
thought
not
only
does
language
make
us
believe
in
the
unchangeableness
of
our
sensations
but
it
will
sometimes
deceive
us
as
to
the
nature
of
the
sensation
felt
thus
when
i
partake
of
a
dish
that
is
supposed
to
be
exquisite
the
name
which
it
bears
suggestive
of
the
approval
given
to
it
comes
between
my
sensation
and
my
consciousness
i
may
believe
that
the
flavour
pleases
me
when
a
slight
effort
of
attention
would
prove
the
contrary
in
short
the
word
with
outlines
the
rough
and
ready
word
which
stores
up
the
stable
common
and
consequently
impersonal
element
in
the
impressions
of
mankind
overwhelms
or
at
least
covers
over
the
delicate
and
fugitive
impressions
of
our
individual
consciousness
to
maintain
the
struggle
on
equal
terms
the
latter
ought
to
express
themselves
in
precise
words
but
these
words
as
soon
as
they
were
formed
would
turn
against
the
sensation
which
gave
birth
to
them
and
invented
to
show
that
the
sensation
is
unstable
they
would
impose
on
it
their
own
stability
sidenote
how
analysis
and
description
distort
the
feelings
this
overwhelming
of
the
immediate
consciousness
is
nowhere
so
striking
as
in
the
case
of
our
feelings
a
violent
love
or
a
deep
melancholy
takes
possession
of
our
soul
here
we
feel
a
thousand
different
elements
which
dissolve
into
and
permeate
one
another
without
any
precise
outlines
without
the
least
tendency
to
externalize
themselves
in
relation
to
one
another
hence
their
originality
we
distort
them
as
soon
as
we
distinguish
a
numerical
multiplicity
in
their
confused
mass
what
will
it
be
then
when
we
set
them
out
isolated
from
one
another
in
this
homogeneous
medium
which
may
be
called
either
time
or
space
whichever
you
prefer
a
moment
ago
each
of
them
was
borrowing
an
indefinable
colour
from
its
surroundings
now
we
have
it
colourless
and
ready
to
accept
a
name
the
feeling
itself
is
a
being
which
lives
and
develops
and
is
therefore
constantly
changing
otherwise
how
could
it
gradually
lead
us
to
form
a
resolution
our
resolution
would
be
immediately
taken
but
it
lives
because
the
duration
in
which
it
develops
is
a
duration
whose
moments
permeate
one
another
by
separating
these
moments
from
each
other
by
spreading
out
time
in
space
we
have
caused
this
feeling
to
lose
its
life
and
its
colour
hence
we
are
now
standing
before
our
own
shadow
we
believe
that
we
have
analysed
our
feeling
while
we
have
really
replaced
it
by
a
juxtaposition
of
lifeless
states
which
can
be
translated
into
words
and
each
of
which
constitutes
the
common
element
the
impersonal
residue
of
the
impressions
felt
in
a
given
case
by
the
whole
of
society
and
this
is
why
we
reason
about
these
states
and
apply
our
simple
logic
to
them
having
set
them
up
as
genera
by
the
mere
fact
of
having
isolated
them
from
one
another
we
have
prepared
them
for
use
in
some
future
deduction
now
if
some
bold
novelist
tearing
aside
the
cleverly
woven
curtain
of
our
conventional
ego
shows
us
under
this
appearance
of
logic
a
fundamental
absurdity
under
this
juxtaposition
of
simple
states
an
infinite
permeation
of
a
thousand
different
impressions
which
have
already
ceased
to
exist
the
instant
they
are
named
we
commend
him
for
having
known
us
better
than
we
knew
ourselves
this
is
not
the
case
however
and
the
very
fact
that
he
spreads
out
our
feeling
in
a
homogeneous
time
and
expresses
its
elements
by
words
shows
that
he
in
his
turn
is
only
offering
us
its
shadow
but
he
has
arranged
this
shadow
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
us
suspect
the
extraordinary
and
illogical
nature
of
the
object
which
projects
it
he
has
made
us
reflect
by
giving
outward
expression
to
something
of
that
contradiction
that
interpenetration
which
is
the
very
essence
of
the
elements
expressed
encouraged
by
him
we
have
put
aside
for
an
instant
the
veil
which
we
interposed
between
our
consciousness
and
ourselves
he
has
brought
us
back
into
our
own
presence
sidenote
on
the
surface
our
conscious
states
obey
the
laws
of
association
deeper
down
they
interpenetrate
and
form
a
part
of
ourselves
we
should
experience
the
same
sort
of
surprise
if
we
strove
to
seize
our
ideas
themselves
in
their
natural
state
as
our
consciousness
would
perceive
them
if
it
were
no
longer
beset
by
space
this
breaking
up
of
the
constituent
elements
of
an
idea
which
issues
in
abstraction
is
too
convenient
for
us
to
do
without
it
in
ordinary
life
and
even
in
philosophical
discussion
but
when
we
fancy
that
the
parts
thus
artificially
separated
are
the
genuine
threads
with
which
the
concrete
idea
was
woven
when
substituting
for
the
interpenetration
of
the
real
terms
the
juxtaposition
of
their
symbols
we
claim
to
make
duration
out
of
space
we
unavoidably
fall
into
the
mistakes
of
associationism
we
shall
not
insist
on
the
latter
point
which
will
be
the
subject
of
a
thorough
examination
in
the
next
chapter
let
it
be
enough
to
say
that
the
impulsive
zeal
with
which
we
take
sides
on
certain
questions
shows
how
our
intellect
has
its
instincts
and
what
can
an
instinct
of
this
kind
be
if
not
an
impetus
common
to
all
our
ideas
their
very
interpenetration
the
beliefs
to
which
we
most
strongly
adhere
are
those
of
which
we
should
find
it
most
difficult
to
give
an
account
and
the
reasons
by
which
we
justify
them
are
seldom
those
which
have
led
us
to
adopt
them
in
a
certain
sense
we
have
adopted
them
without
any
reason
for
what
makes
them
valuable
in
our
eyes
is
that
they
match
the
colour
of
all
our
other
ideas
and
that
from
the
very
first
we
have
seen
in
them
something
of
ourselves
hence
they
do
not
take
in
our
minds
that
common
looking
form
which
they
will
assume
as
soon
as
we
try
to
give
expression
to
them
in
words
and
although
they
bear
the
same
name
in
other
minds
they
are
by
no
means
the
same
thing
the
fact
is
that
each
of
them
has
the
same
kind
of
life
as
a
cell
in
an
organism
everything
which
affects
the
general
state
of
the
self
affects
it
also
but
while
the
cell
occupies
a
definite
point
in
the
organism
an
idea
which
is
truly
ours
fills
the
whole
of
our
self
not
all
our
ideas
however
are
thus
incorporated
in
the
fluid
mass
of
our
conscious
states
many
float
on
the
surface
like
dead
leaves
on
the
water
of
a
pond
the
mind
when
it
thinks
them
over
and
over
again
finds
them
ever
the
same
as
if
they
were
external
to
it
among
these
are
the
ideas
which
we
receive
ready
made
and
which
remain
in
us
without
ever
being
properly
assimilated
or
again
the
ideas
which
we
have
omitted
to
cherish
and
which
have
withered
in
neglect
if
in
proportion
as
we
get
away
from
the
deeper
strata
of
the
self
our
conscious
states
tend
more
and
more
to
assume
the
form
of
a
numerical
multiplicity
and
to
spread
out
in
a
homogeneous
space
it
is
just
because
these
conscious
states
tend
to
become
more
and
more
lifeless
more
and
more
impersonal
hence
we
need
not
be
surprised
if
only
those
ideas
which
least
belong
to
us
can
be
adequately
expressed
in
words
only
to
these
as
we
shall
see
does
the
associationist

digging
below
the
surface
of

between

and

we
penetrate
into
the
depths
of
the
organized
and

intelligence
we
shall
witness
the
joining
together
or
rather
the
blending
of
many
ideas
which
when
once
dissociated

to
exclude

overlie

show
us
at
the

time
two
different
persons
who

will
hardly
give
us
an
idea
of
the
interweaving
of
concepts
which
goes
on
when
we
are
awake
the
imagination
of
the
dreamer

off
from
the

imitates
with
mere
images
and
parodies
in
its
own
way

process
which
constantly
goes
on
with
regard
to
ideas
in
the
deeper
regions
of
the
intellectual
life
sidenote
by
separating
our
conscious
states
we
promote
social
life
but
raise
problems
soluble
only
by
recourse
to
the
concrete
and
living
self
thus
may
be
verified
thus
too
will
be
illustrated
by
a
further
study
of
psychic
phenomena
the
principle
from
which
we
started
conscious
life
displays
two
aspects
according
as
we
perceive
it
directly
or
by
refraction
through
space
considered
in
themselves
the
conscious
states
have
no
relation
to
quantity
they
are
pure
quality
they
intermingle
in
such
a
way
that
we
can
not
tell
whether
they
are
one
or
several
nor
even
examine
them
from
this
point
of
view
without
at
once
altering
their
nature
the
duration
which
they
thus
create
is
a
duration
whose
moments
do
not
constitute
a
numerical
multiplicity
to
characterize
these
moments
by
saying
that
they
encroach
on
one
another
would
still
be
to
distinguish
them
if
each
of
us
lived
a
purely
individual
life
if
there
were
neither
society
nor
language
would
our
consciousness
grasp
the
series
of
inner
states
in
this
unbroken
form
undoubtedly
it
would
not
quite
succeed
because
we
should
still
retain
the
idea
of
a
homogeneous
space
in
which
objects
are
sharply
distinguished
from
one
another
and
because
it
is
too
convenient
to
set
out
in
such
a
medium
the
somewhat
cloudy
states
which
first
attract
the
attention
of
consciousness
in
order
to
resolve
them
into
simpler
terms
but
mark
that
the
intuition
of
a
homogeneous
space
is
already
a
step
towards
social
life
probably
animals
do
not
picture
to
themselves
beside
their
sensations
as
we
do
an
external
world
quite
distinct
from
themselves
which
is
the
common
property
of
all
conscious
beings
our
tendency
to
form
a
clear
picture
of
this
externality
of
things
and
the
homogeneity
of
their
medium
is
the
same
as
the
impulse
which
leads
us
to
live
in
common
and
to
speak
but
in
proportion
as
the
conditions
of
social
life
are
more
completely
realized
the
current
which
carries
our
conscious
states
from
within
outwards
is
strengthened
little
by
little
these
states
are
made
into
objects
or
things
they
break
off
not
only
from
one
another
but
from
ourselves
henceforth
we
no
longer
perceive
them
except
in
the
homogeneous
medium
in
which
we
have
set
their
image
and
through
the
word
which
lends
them
its
colour
thus
a
second
self
is
formed
which
obscures
the
first
a
self
whose
existence
is
made
up
of
distinct
moments
whose
states
are
separated
from
one
another
and
easily
expressed
in
words
i
do
not
mean
here
to
split
up
the
personality
nor
to
bring
back
in
another
form
the
numerical
multiplicity
which
i
shut
out
at
the
beginning
it
is
the
same
self
which
perceives
distinct
states
at
first
and
which
by
afterwards
concentrating
its
attention
will
see
these
states
melt
into
one
another
like
the
crystals
of
a
when
touched
for
some
time
with
the
finger
and
in
truth
for
the
sake
of
language
the
self
has
everything
to
gain
by
not
bringing
back
confusion
where
order
reigns
and
in
not
upsetting
this
ingenious
arrangement
of
almost
impersonal
states
by
which
it
has
ceased
to
form
a
kingdom
within
a
kingdom
an
inner
life
with
well
distinguished
moments
and
with
clearly
characterized
states
will
answer
better
the
requirements
of
social
life
indeed
a
superficial
psychology
may
be
content
with
describing
it
without
thereby
falling
into
error
on
condition
however
that
it
restricts
itself
to
the
study
of
what
has
taken
place
and
leaves
out
what
is
going
on
but
if
passing
from
statics
to
dynamics
this
psychology
claims
to
reason
about
things
in
the
making
as
it
reasoned
about
things
made
if
it
offers
us
the
concrete
and
living
self
as
an
association
of
terms
which
are
distinct
from
one
another
and
are
set
side
by
side
in
a
homogeneous
medium
it
will
see
difficulty
after
difficulty
rising
in
its
path
and
these
difficulties
will
multiply
the
greater
the
efforts
it
makes
to
overcome
them
for
all
its
efforts
will
only
bring
into
clearer
light
the
absurdity
of
the
fundamental
hypothesis
by
which
it
spreads
out
time
in
space
and
puts
succession
at
the
very
centre
of
simultaneity
we
shall
see
that
the
contradictions
implied
in
the
problems
of
causality
freedom
personality
spring
from
no
other
source
and
that
if
we
wish
to
get
rid
of
them
we
have
only
to
go
back
to
the
real
and
concrete
self
and
give
up
its
symbolical
substitute
i
had
already
completed
the
present
work
when
i
read
in
the
for
and
pillon
very
remarkable
refutation
of
an
interesting
article
by
noël
on
the
interconnexion
of
the
notions
of
number
and
space
but
i
have
not
found
it
necessary
to
make
any
alterations
in
the
following
pages
seeing
that
pillon
does
not
distinguish
between
time
as
quality
and
time
as
quantity
between
the
multiplicity
of
juxtaposition
and
that
of
interpenetration
without
this
vital
distinction
which
it
is
the
chief
aim
of
the
present
chapter
to
establish
it
would
be
possible
to
maintain
with
pillon
that
number
may
be
built
up
from
the
relation
of
but
what
is
here
meant
by
if
the
terms
form
an
organic
whole
they
will
never
lead
us
to
the
notion
of
number
if
they
remain
distinct
they
are
in
juxtaposition
and
we
are
dealing
with
space
it
is
no
use
to
quote
the
example
of
simultaneous
impressions
received
by
several
senses
we
either
leave
these
sensations
their
specific
differences
which
amounts
to
saying
that
we
do
not
count
them
or
else
we
eliminate
their
differences
and
then
how
are
we
to
distinguish
them
if
not
by
their
position
or
that
of
their
symbols
we
shall
see
that
the
verb
to
distinguish
has
two
meanings
the
one
qualitative
the
other
quantitative
these
two
meanings
have
been
confused
in
my
opinion
by
the
philosophers
who
have
dealt
with
the
relations
between
number
and
space

the
organization
of
conscious
states
free
will
sidenote
mechanism
dynamism
and
free
will
it
is
easy
to
see
why
the
question
of
free
will
brings
into
conflict
these
two
rival
systems
of
nature
mechanism
and
dynamism
dynamism
starts
from
the
idea
of
voluntary
activity
given
by
consciousness
and
comes
to
represent
inertia
by
gradually
emptying
this
idea
it
has
thus
no
difficulty
in
conceiving
free
force
on
the
one
hand
and
matter
governed
by
laws
on
the
other
mechanism
follows
the
opposite
course
it
assumes
that
the
materials
which
it
synthesizes
are
governed
by
necessary
laws
and
although
it
reaches
richer
and
richer
combinations
which
are
more
and
more
difficult
to
foresee
and
to
all
appearance
more
and
more
contingent
yet
it
never
gets
out
of
the
narrow
circle
of
necessity
within
which
it
at
first
shut
itself
up
sidenote
for
dynamism
facts
more
real
than
laws
mechanism
reverses
this
attitude
this
idea
of
spontaneity
simpler
than
that
of
inertia
a
thorough
examination
of
these
two
conceptions
of
nature
will
show
that
they
involve
two
very
different
hypotheses
as
to
the
relations
between
laws
and
the
facts
which
they
govern
as
he
looks
higher
and
higher
the
believer
in
dynamism
thinks
that
he
perceives
facts
which
more
and
more
elude
the
grasp
of
laws
he
thus
sets
up
the
fact
as
the
absolute
reality
and
the
law
as
the
more
or
less
symbolical
expression
of
this
reality
mechanism
on
the
contrary
discovers
within
the
particular
fact
a
certain
number
of
laws
of
which
the
fact
is
thus
made
to
be
the
meeting
point
and
nothing
else
on
this
hypothesis
it
is
the
law
which
becomes
the
genuine
reality
now
if
it
is
asked
why
the
one
party
assigns
a
higher
reality
to
the
fact
and
the
other
to
the
law
it
will
be
found
that
mechanism
and
dynamism
take
the
word
in
two
very
different
senses
for
the
first
any
principle
is
simple
of
which
the
effects
can
be
foreseen
and
even
calculated
thus
by
the
very
definition
the
notion
of
inertia
becomes
simpler
than
that
of
freedom
the
homogeneous
simpler
than
the
heterogeneous
the
abstract
simpler
than
the
concrete
but
dynamism
is
not
anxious
so
much
to
arrange
the
notions
in
the
most
convenient
order
as
to
find
out
their
real
relationship
often
in
fact
the
simple
notion
that
which
the
believer
in
mechanism
regards
as
primitive
has
been
obtained
by
the
blending
together
of
several
richer
notions
which
seem
to
be
derived
from
it
and
which
have
more
or
less
neutralized
one
another
in
this
very
process
of
blending
just
as
darkness
may
be
produced
by
the
interference
of
two
lights
regarded
from
this
new
point
of
view
the
idea
of
spontaneity
is
indisputably
simpler
than
that
of
inertia
since
the
second
can
be
understood
and
defined
only
by
means
of
the
first
while
the
first
is
for
each
of
us
has
the
immediate
knowledge
be
it
thought
true
or
fallacious
of
his
free
spontaneity
without
the
notion
of
inertia
having
anything
to
do
with
this
knowledge
but
if
we
wish
to
define
the
inertia
of
matter
we
must
say
that
it
can
not
move
or
stop
of
its
own
accord
that
every
body
perseveres
in
the
state
of
rest
or
motion
so
long
as
it
is
not
acted
upon
by
any
force
and
in
both
cases
we
are
unavoidably
carried
back
to
the
idea
of
activity
it
is
therefore
natural
that
priori
we
should
reach
two
opposite
conceptions
of
human
activity
according
to
the
way
in
which
we
understand
the
relation
between
the
concrete
and
the
abstract
the
simple
and
the
complex
facts
and
laws
sidenote
determinism
physical
psychological
former
reducible
to
latter
which
itself
rests
on
inaccurate
conception
of
multiplicity
of
conscious
states
or
duration
posteriori
however
definite
facts
are
appealed
to
against
freedom
some
physical
others
psychological
sometimes
it
is
asserted
that
our
actions
are
necessitated
by
our
feelings
our
ideas
and
the
whole
preceding
series
of
our
conscious
states
sometimes
freedom
is
denounced
as
being
incompatible
with
the
fundamental
properties
of
matter
and
in
particular
with
the
principle
of
the
conservation
of
energy
hence
two
kinds
of
determinism
two
apparently
different
empirical
proofs
of
universal
necessity
we
shall
show
that
the
second
of
these
two
forms
is
reducible
to
the
first
and
that
all
determinism
even
physical
determinism
involves
a
psychological
hypothesis
we
shall
then
prove
that
psychological
determinism
itself
and
the
refutations
which
are
given
of
it
rest
on
an
inaccurate
conception
of
the
multiplicity
of
conscious
states
or
rather
of
duration
thus
in
the
light
of
the
principles
worked
out
in
the
foregoing
chapter
we
shall
see
a
self
emerge
whose
activity
can
not
be
compared
to
that
of
any
other
force
sidenote
physical
determinism
stated
in
the
language
of
the
molecular
theory
of
matter
physical
determinism
in
its
latest
form
is
closely
bound
up
with
mechanical
or
rather
kinetic
theories
of
matter
the
universe
is
pictured
as
a
heap
of
matter
which
the
imagination
resolves
into
molecules
and
atoms
these
particles
are
supposed
to
carry
out
unceasingly
movements
of
every
kind
sometimes
of
vibration
sometimes
of
translation
and
physical
phenomena
chemical
action
the
qualities
of
matter
which
our
senses
perceive
heat
sound
electricity
perhaps
even
attraction
are
thought
to
be
reducible
objectively
to
these
elementary
movements
the
matter
which
goes
to
make
up
organized
bodies
being
subject
to
the
same
laws
we
find
in
the
nervous
system
for
example
only
molecules
and
atoms
which
are
in
motion
and
attract
and
repel
one
another
now
if
all
bodies
organized
or
unorganized
thus
act
and
react
on
one
another
in
their
ultimate
parts
it
is
obvious
that
the
molecular
state
of
the
brain
at
a
given
moment
will
be
modified
by
the
shocks
which
the
nervous
system
receives
from
the
surrounding
matter
so
that
the
sensations
feelings
and
ideas
which
succeed
one
another
in
us
can
be
defined
as
mechanical
resultants
obtained
by
the
compounding
of
shocks
received
from
without
with
the
previous
movements
of
the
atoms
of
the
nervous
substance
but
the
opposite
phenomenon
may
occur
and
the
molecular
movements
which
go
on
in
the
nervous
system
if
compounded
with
one
another
or
with
others
will
often
give
as
resultant
a
reaction
of
our
organism
on
its
environment
hence
the
reflex
movements
hence
also
the
free
and
voluntary
actions
as
moreover
the
principle
of
the
conservation
of
energy
has
been
assumed
to
admit
of
no
exception
there
is
not
an
atom
either
in
the
nervous
system
or
in
the
whole
of
the
universe
whose
position
is
not
determined
by
the
sum
of
the
mechanical
actions
which
the
other
atoms
exert
upon
it
and
the
mathematician
who
knew
the
position
of
the
molecules
or
atoms
of
a
human
organism
at
a
given
moment
as
well
as
the
position
and
motion
of
all
the
atoms
in
the
universe
capable
of
influencing
it
could
calculate
with
unfailing
certainty
the
past
present
and
future
actions
of
the
person
to
whom
this
organism
belongs
just
as
one
predicts
an
astronomical
phenomenon
sidenote
if
principle
of
conservation
of
energy
is
universal
physiological
and
nervous
phenomena
are
necessitated
but
perhaps
not
conscious
states
we
shall
not
raise
any
difficulty
about
recognizing
that
this
conception
of
physiological
phenomena
in
general
and
nervous
phenomena
in
particular
is
a
very
natural
deduction
from
the
law
of
the
conservation
of
energy
certainly
the
atomic
theory
of
matter
is
still
at
the
hypothetical
stage
and
the
purely
kinetic
explanations
of
physical
facts
lose
more
than
they
gain
by
being
too
closely
bound
up
with
it
we
must
observe
however
that
even
if
we
leave
aside
the
atomic
theory
as
well
as
any
other
hypothesis
as
to
the
nature
of
the
ultimate
elements
of
matter
the
necessitating
of
physiological
facts
by
their
antecedents
follows
from
the
theorem
of
the
conservation
of
energy
as
soon
as
we
extend
this
theorem
to
all
processes
going
on
in
all
living
bodies
for
to
admit
the
universality
of
this
theorem
is
to
assume
at
bottom
that
the
material
points
of
which
the
universe
is
composed
are
subject
solely
to
forces
of
attraction
and
repulsion
arising
from
these
points
themselves
and
possessing
intensities
which
depend
only
on
their
distances
hence
the
relative
position
of
these
material
points
at
a
given
moment
whatever
be
their
nature
would
be
strictly
determined
by
relation
to
what
it
was
at
the
preceding
moment
let
us
then
assume
for
a
moment
that
this
last
hypothesis
is
true
we
propose
to
show
in
the
first
place
that
it
does
not
involve
the
absolute
determination
of
our
conscious
states
by
one
another
and
then
that
the
very
universality
of
the
principle
of
the
conservation
of
energy
can
not
be
admitted
except
in
virtue
of
some
psychological
hypothesis
sidenote
to
prove
conscious
states
determined
we
should
have
to
show
a
necessary
connexion
between
them
and
cerebral
states
no
such
proof
even
if
we
assumed
that
the
position
the
direction
and
the
velocity
of
each
atom
of
cerebral
matter
are
determined
at
every
moment
of
time
it
would
not
at
all
follow
that
our
psychic
life
is
subject
to
the
same
necessity
for
we
should
first
have
to
prove
that
a
strictly
determined
psychic
state
corresponds
to
a
definite
cerebral
state
and
the
proof
of
this
is
still
to
be
given
as
a
rule
we
do
not
think
of
demanding
it
because
we
know
that
a
definite
vibration
of
the
tympanum
a
definite
stimulation
of
the
auditory
nerve
gives
a
definite
note
on
the
scale
and
because
the
parallelism
of
the
physical
and
psychical
series
has
been
proved
in
a
fairly
large
number
of
cases
but
then
nobody
has
ever
contended
that
we
were
free
under
given
conditions
to
hear
any
note
or
perceive
any
colour
we
liked
sensations
of
this
kind
like
many
other
psychic
states
are
obviously
bound
up
with
certain
determining
conditions
and
it
is
just
for
this
reason
that
it
has
been
possible
to
imagine
or
discover
beneath
them
a
system
of
movements
which
obey
our
abstract
mechanics
in
short
wherever
we
succeed
in
giving
a
mechanical
explanation
we
observe
a
fairly
strict
parallelism
between
the
physiological
and
the
psychological
series
and
we
need
not
be
surprised
at
it
since
explanations
of
this
kind
will
assuredly
not
be
met
with
except
where
the
two
series
exhibit
parallel
terms
but
to
extend
this
parallelism
to
the
series
themselves
in
their
totality
is
to
settle
the
problem
of
freedom
certainly
this
may
be
done
and
some
of
the
greatest
thinkers
have
set
the
example
but
then
as
we
said
at
first
it
was
not
for
reasons
of
a
physical
order
that
they
asserted
the
strict
correspondence
between
states
of
consciousness
and
modes
of
extension
leibniz
ascribed
it
to
a
preestablished
harmony
and
would
never
have
admitted
that
a
motion
could
give
rise
to
a
perception
as
a
cause
produces
an
effect
spinoza
said
that
the
modes
of
thought
and
the
modes
of
extension
correspond
with
but
never
influence
one
another
they
only
express
in
two
different
languages
the
same
eternal
truth
but
the
theories
of
physical
determinism
which
are
rife
at
the
present
day
are
far
from
displaying
the
same
clearness
the
same
geometrical
rigour
they
point
to
molecular
movements
taking
place
in
the
brain
consciousness
is
supposed
to
arise
out
of
these
at
times
in
some
mysterious
way
or
rather
to
follow
their
track
like
the
phosphorescent
line
which
results
from
the
rubbing
of
a
match
or
yet
again
we
are
to
think
of
an
invisible
musician
playing
behind
the
scenes
while
the
actor
strikes
a
keyboard
the
notes
of
which
yield
no
sound
consciousness
must
be
supposed
to
come
from
an
unknown
region
and
to
be
superimposed
on
the
molecular
vibrations
just
as
the
melody
is
on
the
rhythmical
movements
of
the
actor
but
whatever
image
we
fall
back
upon
we
do
not
prove
and
we
never
shall
prove
by
any
reasoning
that
the
psychic
fact
is
fatally
determined
by
the
molecular
movement
for
in
a
movement
we
may
find
the
reason
of
another
movement
but
not
the
reason
of
a
conscious
state
only
observation
can
prove
that
the
latter
accompanies
the
former
now
the
unvarying
conjunction
of
the
two
terms
has
not
been
verified
by
experience
except
in
a
very
limited
number
of
cases
and
with
regard
to
facts
which
all
confess
to
be
almost
independent
of
the
will
but
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
physical
determinism
extends
this
conjunction
to
all
possible
cases
sidenote
physical
determinism
when
assumed
to
be
universal
postulates
psychological
determinism
consciousness
indeed
informs
us
that
the
majority
of
our
actions
can
be
explained
by
motives
but
it
does
not
appear
that
determination
here
means
necessity
since
common
sense
believes
in
free
will
the
determinist
however
led
astray
by
a
conception
of
duration
and
causality
which
we
shall
criticise
a
little
later
holds
that
the
determination
of
conscious
states
by
one
another
is
absolute
this
is
the
origin
of
associationist
determinism
an
hypothesis
in
support
of
which
the
testimony
of
consciousness
is
appealed
to
but
which
can
not
in
the
beginning
lay
claim
to
scientific
rigour
it
seems
natural
that
this
so
to
speak
approximate
determinism
this
determinism
of
quality
should
seek
support
from
the
same
mechanism
that
underlies
the
phenomena
of
nature
the
latter
would
thus
convey
to
the
former
its
own
geometrical
character
and
the
transaction
would
be
to
the
advantage
both
of
psychological
determinism
which
would
emerge
from
it
in
a
stricter
form
and
of
physical
mechanism
which
would
then
spread
over
everything
a
fortunate
circumstance
favours
this
alliance
the
simplest
psychic
states
do
in
fact
occur
as
accessories
to
physical
phenomena
and
the
greater
number
of
sensations
seem
to
be
bound
up
with
definite
molecular
movements
this
mere
beginning
of
an
experimental
proof
is
quite
enough
for
the
man
who
for
psychological
reasons
is
already
convinced
that
our
conscious
states
are
the
necessary
outcome
of
the
circumstances
under
which
they
happen
henceforth
he
no
longer
hesitates
to
hold
that
the
drama
enacted
in
the
theatre
of
consciousness
is
a
literal
and
even
slavish
translation
of
some
scenes
performed
by
the
molecules
and
atoms
of
organized
matter
the
physical
determinism
which
is
reached
in
this
way
is
nothing
but
psychological
determinism
seeking
to
verify
itself
and
fix
its
own
outlines
by
an
appeal
to
the
sciences
of
nature
sidenote
is
the
principle
of
conservation
of
energy
universal
valid
but
we
must
own
that
the
amount
of
freedom
which
is
left
to
us
after
strictly
complying
with
the
principle
of
the
conservation
of
energy
is
rather
limited
for
even
if
this
law
does
not
exert
a
necessitating
influence
over
the
course
of
our
ideas
it
will
at
least
determine
our
movements
our
inner
life
will
still
depend
upon
ourselves
up
to
a
certain
point
but
to
an
outside
observer
there
will
be
nothing
to
distinguish
our
activity
from
absolute
automatism
we
are
thus
led
to
inquire
whether
the
very
extension
of
the
principle
of
the
conservation
of
energy
to
all
the
bodies
in
nature
does
not
itself
involve
some
psychological
theory
and
whether
the
scientist
who
did
not
possess
any
prejudice
against
human
freedom
would
think
of
setting
up
this
principle
as
a
universal
law
sidenote
it
implies
that
a
system
can
return
to
its
original
state
neglects
duration
hence
inapplicable
to
living
beings
and
conscious
states
we
must
not
overrate
the
part
played
by
the
principle
of
the
conservation
of
energy
in
the
history
of
the
natural
sciences
in
its
present
form
it
marks
a
certain
phase
in
the
evolution
of
certain
sciences
but
it
has
not
been
the
governing
factor
in
this
evolution
and
we
should
be
wrong
in
making
it
the
indispensable
postulate
of
all
scientific
research
certainly
every
mathematical
operation
which
we
carry
out
on
a
given
quantity
implies
the
permanence
of
this
quantity
throughout
the
course
of
the
operation
in
whatever
way
we
may
split
it
up
in
other
words
what
is
given
is
given
what
is
not
given
is
not
given
and
in
whatever
order
we
add
up
the
same
terms
we
shall
get
the
same
result
science
will
for
ever
remain
subject
to
this
law
which
is
nothing
but
the
law
of
but
this
law
does
not
involve
any
special
hypothesis
as
to
the
nature
of
what
we
ought
to
take
as
given
or
what
will
remain
constant
no
doubt
it
informs
us
that
something
can
not
come
from
nothing
but
experience
alone
will
tell
us
which
aspects
or
functions
of
reality
must
count
for
something
and
which
for
nothing
from
the
point
of
view
of
positive
science
in
short
in
order
to
foresee
the
state
of
a
determinate
system
at
a
determinate
moment
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
something
should
persist
as
a
constant
quantity
throughout
a
series
of
combinations
but
it
belongs
to
experience
to
decide
as
to
the
nature
of
this
something
and
especially
to
let
us
know
whether
it
is
found
in
all
possible
systems
whether
in
other
words
all
possible
systems
lend
themselves
to
our
calculations
it
is
not
certain
that
all
the
physicists
before
leibniz
believed
like
descartes
in
the
conservation
of
a
fixed
quantity
of
motion
in
the
universe
were
their
discoveries
less
valuable
on
this
account
or
their
researches
less
successful
even
when
leibniz
had
substituted
for
this
principle
that
of
the
conservation
of
viva
it
was
not
possible
to
regard
the
law
as
quite
general
since
it
admitted
of
an
obvious
exception
in
the
case
of
the
direct
impact
of
two
inelastic
bodies
thus
science
has
done
for
a
very
long
time
without
a
universal
conservative
principle
in
its
present
form
and
since
the
development
of
the
mechanical
theory
of
heat
the
principle
of
the
conservation
of
energy
certainly
seems
to
apply
to
the
whole
range
of
phenomena
but
no
one
can
tell
whether
the
study
of
physiological
phenomena
in
general
and
of
nervous
phenomena
in
particular
will
not
reveal
to
us
besides
the
or
kinetic
energy
of
which
leibniz
spoke
and
the
potential
energy
which
was
a
later
and
necessary
adjunct
some
new
kind
of
energy
which
may
differ
from
the
other
two
by
rebelling
against
calculation
physical
science
would
not
thereby
lose
any
of
its
exactitude
or
geometrical
rigour
as
has
lately
been
asserted
only
it
would
be
realized
that
conservative
systems
are
not
the
only
systems
possible
and
even
perhaps
that
in
the
whole
of
concrete
reality
each
of
these
systems
plays
the
same
part
as
the
chemist
atom
in
bodies
and
their
combinations
let
us
note
that
the
most
radical
of
mechanical
theories
is
that
which
makes
consciousness
an
which
in
given
circumstances
may
supervene
on
certain
molecular
movements
but
if
molecular
movement
can
create
sensation
out
of
a
zero
of
consciousness
why
should
not
consciousness
in
its
turn
create
movement
either
out
of
a
zero
of
kinetic
and
potential
energy
or
by
making
use
of
this
energy
in
its
own
way
let
us
also
note
that
the
law
of
the
conservation
of
energy
can
only
be
intelligibly
applied
to
a
system
of
which
the
points
after
moving
can
return
to
their
former
positions
this
return
is
at
least
conceived
of
as
possible
and
it
is
supposed
that
under
these
conditions
nothing
would
be
changed
in
the
original
state
of
the
system
as
a
whole
or
of
its
elements
in
short
time
can
not
bite
into
it
and
the
instinctive
though
vague
belief
of
mankind
in
the
conservation
of
a
fixed
quantity
of
matter
a
fixed
quantity
of
energy
perhaps
has
its
root
in
the
very
fact
that
inert
matter
does
not
seem
to
endure
or
to
preserve
any
trace
of
past
time
but
this
is
not
the
case
in
the
realm
of
life
here
duration
certainly
seems
to
act
like
a
cause
and
the
idea
of
putting
things
back
in
their
place
at
the
end
of
a
certain
time
involves
a
kind
of
absurdity
since
such
a
turning
backwards
has
never
been
accomplished
in
the
case
of
a
living
being
but
let
us
admit
that
the
absurdity
is
a
mere
appearance
and
that
the
impossibility
for
living
beings
to
come
back
to
the
past
is
simply
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
phenomena
which
take
place
in
living
bodies
being
infinitely
complex
have
no
chance
of
ever
occurring
again
all
at
the
same
time
at
least
it
will
be
granted
to
us
that
the
hypothesis
of
a
turning
backwards
is
almost
meaningless
in
the
sphere
of
conscious
states
a
sensation
by
the
mere
fact
of
being
prolonged
is
altered
to
the
point
of
becoming
unbearable
the
same
does
not
here
remain
the
same
but
is
reinforced
and
swollen
by
the
whole
of
its
past
in
short
while
the
material
point
as
mechanics
understands
it
remains
in
an
eternal
present
the
past
is
a
reality
perhaps
for
living
bodies
and
certainly
for
conscious
beings
while
past
time
is
neither
a
gain
nor
a
loss
for
a
system
assumed
to
be
conservative
it
may
be
a
gain
for
the
living
being
and
it
is
indisputably
one
for
the
conscious
being
such
being
the
case
is
there
not
much
to
be
said
for
the
hypothesis
of
a
conscious
force
or
free
will
which
subject
to
the
action
of
time
and
storing
up
duration
may
thereby
escape
the
law
of
the
conservation
of
energy
sidenote
the
idea
of
the
universality
of
conservation
depends
on
confusion
between
concrete
duration
and
abstract
time
in
truth
it
is
not
a
wish
to
meet
the
requirements
of
positive
science
but
rather
a
psychological
mistake
which
has
caused
this
abstract
principle
of
mechanics
to
be
set
up
as
a
universal
law
as
we
are
not
accustomed
to
observe
ourselves
directly
but
perceive
ourselves
through
forms
borrowed
from
the
external
world
we
are
led
to
believe
that
real
duration
the
duration
lived
by
consciousness
is
the
same
as
the
duration
which
glides
over
the
inert
atoms
without
penetrating
and
altering
them
hence
it
is
that
we
do
not
see
any
absurdity
in
putting
things
back
in
their
place
after
a
lapse
of
time
in
supposing
the
same
motives
acting
afresh
on
the
same
persons
and
in
concluding
that
these
causes
would
again
produce
the
same
effect
that
such
an
hypothesis
has
no
real
meaning
is
what
we
shall
prove
later
on
for
the
present
let
us
simply
show
that
if
once
we
enter
upon
this
path
we
are
of
course
led
to
set
up
the
principle
of
the
conservation
of
energy
as
a
universal
law
for
we
have
thereby
got
rid
of
just
that
difference
between
the
outer
and
the
inner
world
which
a
close
examination
shows
to
be
the
main
one
we
have
identified
true
duration
with
apparent
duration
after
this
it
would
be
absurd
to
consider
time
even
time
as
a
cause
of
gain
or
loss
as
a
concrete
reality
or
a
force
in
its
own
way
thus
while
we
ought
only
to
say
if
we
kept
aloof
from
all
presuppositions
concerning
free
will
that
the
law
of
the
conservation
of
energy
governs
physical
phenomena
and
one
day
be
extended
to
all
phenomena
if
psychological
facts
also
prove
favourable
to
it
we
go
far
beyond
this
and
under
the
influence
of
a
metaphysical
prepossession
we
lay
down
the
principle
of
the
conservation
of
energy
as
a
law
which
govern
all
phenomena
whatever
or
must
be
supposed
to
do
so
until
psychological
facts
have
actually
spoken
against
it
science
properly
so
called
has
therefore
nothing
to
do
with
all
this
we
are
simply
confronted
with
a
confusion
between
concrete
duration
and
abstract
time
two
very
different
things
in
a
word
the
physical
determinism
is
reducible
at
bottom
to
a
psychological
determinism
and
it
is
this
latter
doctrine
as
we
hinted
at
first
that
we
have
to
examine
sidenote
psychological
determinism
depends
on
associationist
conception
of
mind
psychological
determinism
in
its
latest
and
most
precise
shape
implies
an
associationist
conception
of
mind
the
existing
state
of
consciousness
is
first
thought
of
as
necessitated
by
the
preceding
states
but
it
is
soon
realized
that
this
can
not
be
a
geometrical
necessity
such
as
that
which
connects
a
resultant
for
example
with
its
components
for
between
successive
conscious
states
there
exists
a
difference
of
quality
which
will
always
frustrate
any
attempt
to
deduce
any
one
of
them
from
its
predecessors
so
experience
is
appealed
to
with
the
object
of
showing
that
the
transition
from
one
psychic
state
to
another
can
always
be
explained
by
some
simple
reason
the
second
obeying
as
it
were
the
call
of
the
first
experience
really
does
show
this
and
as
for
ourselves
we
shall
willingly
admit
that
there
always
is
some
relation
between
the
existing
state
of
consciousness
and
any
new
state
to
which
consciousness
passes
but
is
this
relation
which
explains
the
transition
the
cause
of
it
sidenote
the
series
of
associations
may
be
merely
an
ex
post
facto
attempt
to
account
for
a
new
idea
may
we
here
give
an
account
of
what
we
have
personally
observed
in
resuming
a
conversation
which
had
been
interrupted
for
a
few
moments
we
have
happened
to
notice
that
both
we
ourselves
and
our
friend
were
thinking
of
some
new
object
at
the
same
the
reason
is
it
will
be
said
that
each
has
followed
up
for
his
own
part
the
natural
development
of
the
idea
at
which
the
conversation
had
stopped
the
same
series
of
associations
has
been
formed
on
both
no
doubt
this
interpretation
holds
good
in
a
fairly
large
number
of
cases
careful
inquiry
however
has
led
us
to
an
unexpected
result
it
is
a
fact
that
the
two
speakers
do
connect
the
new
subject
of
conversation
with
the
former
one
they
will
even
point
out
the
intervening
ideas
but
curiously
enough
they
will
not
always
connect
the
new
idea
which
they
have
both
reached
with
the
same
point
of
the
preceding
conversation
and
the
two
series
of
intervening
associations
may
be
quite
different
what
are
we
to
conclude
from
this
if
not
that
this
common
idea
is
due
to
an
unknown
cause
perhaps
to
some
physical
influence
and
that
in
order
to
justify
its
emergence
it
has
called
forth
a
series
of
antecedents
which
explain
it
and
which
seem
to
be
its
cause
but
are
really
its
effect
sidenote

from
hypnotic
suggestion
when
a
patient
carries
out
at
the
appointed
time
the
suggestion
received
in
the
hypnotic
state
the
act
which
he
performs
is
brought
about
according
to
him
by
the
preceding

of
his
conscious
states
yet
these
states
are
really
effects
and
not

it
was
necessary
that
the
act
should
take
place
it
was
also
necessary
that
the
patient
should
explain
it
to
himself
and
it
is
the
future
act
which
determined
by
a
kind
of
attraction
the
whole
series
of
psychic
states
of
which
it
is
to
be
the
natural
consequence
the
determinists
will
seize
on
this
argument
it
proves
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
we
are
sometimes
irresistibly
subject
to
another
will
but
does
it
not
also
show
us
how
our
own
will
is
capable
of
willing
for
willing
sake
and
of
then
leaving
the
act
which
has
been
performed
to
be
explained
by
antecedents
of
which
it
has
really
been
the
cause
sidenote
illustration
from
deliberation
if
we
question
ourselves
carefully
we
shall
see
that
we
sometimes
weigh
motives
and
deliberate
over
them
when
our
mind
is
already
made
up
an
inner
voice
hardly
perceivable
whispers
why
this
deliberation
you
know
the
result
and
you
are
quite
certain
of
what
you
are
going
to
do
but
no
matter
it
seems
that
we
make
a
point
of
the
principle
of
mechanism
and
of
conforming
to
the
laws
of
the
association
of
ideas
the
abrupt
intervention
of
the
will
is
a
kind
of
which
our
mind
foresees
and
which
it
tries
to
legitimate
beforehand
by
a
formal
deliberation
true
it
could
be
asked
whether
the
will
even
when
it
wills
for
willing
sake
does
not
obey
some
decisive
reason
and
whether
willing
for
willing
sake
is
free
willing
we
shall
not
insist
on
this
point
for
the
moment
it
will
be
enough
for
us
to
have
shown
that
even
when
adopting
the
point
of
view
of
associationism
it
is
difficult
to
maintain
that
an
act
is
absolutely
determined
by
its
motive
and
our
conscious
states
by
one
another
beneath
these
deceptive
appearances
a
more
attentive
psychology
sometimes
reveals
to
us
effects
which
precede
their
causes
and
phenomena
of
psychic
attraction
which
elude
the
known
laws
of
the
association
of
ideas
but
the
time
has
come
to
ask
whether
the
very
point
of
view
which
associationism
adopts
does
not
involve
a
defective
conception
of
the
self
and
of
the
multiplicity
of
conscious
states
sidenote
associationism
involves
a
defective
conception
of
the
self
associationist
determinism
represents
the
self
as
a
collection
of
psychic
states
the
strongest
of
which
exerts
a
prevailing
influence
and
carries
the
others
with
it
this
doctrine
thus
sharply
distinguishes
psychic
phenomena
from
one
another

my
aversion
to
the
crime

my
dread

been
weaker

impelled
me
to
commit
it
and
a
little
further

his
desire
to
do
right
and
his
aversion
to
doing
wrong
are
strong
enough
to
overcome
any
other
desire

aversion
which
may
conflict
with
them
thus
desire
aversion

are
here
presented
as
distinct
things
which
there
is
no
inconvenience
in
naming
separately

when

which

might

alfred

goes
so
far
as
to
make
the

itself
a

capable
of
counterbalancing

here
however
lies
the
danger
both
parties
commit
themselves
to
a
confusion
which
arises
from
language
and
which
is
due
to
the
fact
that
language
is
not
meant
to
convey
all
the
delicate
shades
of
inner
states
sidenote
this
erroneous
tendency
aided

i
rise
for
example
to
open
the
window
and
i
have
hardly
stood
up
before
i
forget
what
i
had
to
all
right
it
will
be
said
you
have
associated
two
ideas
that
of
an
end
to
be
attained
and
that
of
a
movement
to
be
accomplished
one
of
the
ideas
has
vanished
and
only
the
idea
of
the
movement
however
i
do
not
sit
down
again
i
have
a
confused
feeling
that
something
remains
to
be
done
this
particular
standing
still
therefore
is
not
the
same
as
any
other
standing
still
in
the
position
which
i
take
up
the
act
to
be
performed
is
as
it
were
prefigured
so
that
i
have
only
to
keep
this
position
to
study
it
or
rather
to
feel
it
intimately
in
order
to
recover
the
idea
which
had
vanished
for
a
moment
hence
this
idea
must
have
tinged
with
a
certain
particular
colouring
the
mental
image
of
the
intended
movement
and
the
position
taken
up
and
this
colouring
without
doubt
would
not
have
been
the
same
if
the
end
to
be
attained
had
been
different
nevertheless
language
would
have
still
expressed
the
movement
and
the
position
in
the
same
way
and
associationism
would
have
distinguished
the
two
cases
by
saying
that
with
the
idea
of
the
same
movement
there
was
associated
this
time
the
idea
of
a
new
end
as
if
the
mere
newness
of
the
end
to
be
attained
did
not
alter
in
some
degree
the
idea
of
the
movement
to
be
performed
even
though
the
movement
itself
remained
the
same
we
should
thus
say
not
that
the
image
of
a
certain
position
can
be
connected
in
consciousness
with
images
of
different
ends
to
be
attained
but
rather
that
positions
geometrically
identical
outside
look
different
to
consciousness
from
the
inside
according
to
the
end
contemplated
the
mistake
of
associationism
is
that
it
first
did
away
with
the
qualitative
element
in
the
act
to
be
performed
and
retained
only
the
geometrical
and
impersonal
element
with
the
idea
of
this
act
thus
rendered
colourless
it
was
then
necessary
to
associate
some
specific
difference
to
distinguish
it
from
many
other
acts
but
this
association
is
the
work
of
the
associationist
philosopher
who
is
studying
my
mind
rather
than
of
my
mind
itself
sidenote
illustration
from
associations
of
smell
i
smell
a
rose
and
immediately
confused
recollections
of
childhood
come
back
to
my
memory
in
truth
these
recollections
have
not
been
called
up
by
the
perfume
of
the
rose
i
breathe
them
in
with
the
very
scent
it
means
all
that
to
me
to
others
it
will
smell
it
is
always
the
same
scent
you
will
say
but
associated
with
different
i
am
quite
willing
that
you
should
express
yourself
in
this
way
but
do
not
forget
that
you
have
first
removed
the
personal
element
from
the
different
impressions
which
the
rose
makes
on
each
one
of
us
you
have
retained
only
the
objective
aspect
that
part
of
the
scent
of
the
rose
which
is
public
property
and
thereby
belongs
to
space
only
thus
was
it
possible
to
give
a
name
to
the
rose
and
its
perfume
you
then
found
it
necessary
in
order
to
distinguish
our
personal
impressions
from
one
another
to
add
specific
characteristics
to
the
general
idea
of
and
you
now
say
that
our
different
impressions
our
personal
impressions
result
from
the
fact
that
we
associate
different
recollections
with
but
the
association
of
which
you
speak
hardly
exists
except
for
you
and
as
a
method
of
explanation
it
is
in
this
way
that
by
setting
side
by
side
certain
letters
of
an
alphabet
common
to
a
number
of
known
languages
we
may
imitate
fairly
well
such
and
such
a
characteristic
sound
belonging
to
a
new
one
but
not
with
any
of
these
letters
nor
with
all
of
them
has
the
sound
itself
been
built
up
sidenote
associationism
fails
to
distinguish
between
the
multiplicity
of
juxtaposition
and
that
of
fusion
we
are
thus
brought
back
to
the
distinction
which
we
set
up
above
between
the
multiplicity
of
juxtaposition
and
that
of
fusion
or
interpenetration
such
and
such
a
feeling
such
and
such
an
idea
contains
an
indefinite
plurality
of
conscious
states
but
the
plurality
will
not
be
observed
unless
it
is
as
it
were
spread
out
in
this
homogeneous
medium
which
some
call
duration
but
which
is
in
reality
space
we
shall
then
perceive
terms
external
to
one
another
and
these
terms
will
no
longer
be
the
states
of
consciousness
themselves
but
their
symbols
or
speaking
more
exactly
the
words
which
express
them
there
is
as
we
have
pointed
out
a
close
connexion
between
the
faculty
of
conceiving
a
homogeneous
medium
such
as
space
and
that
of
thinking
by
means
of
general
ideas
as
soon
as
we
try
to
give
an
account
of
a
conscious
state
to
analyse
it
this
state
which
is
above
all
personal
will
be
resolved
into
impersonal
elements
external
to
one
another
each
of
which
calls
up
the
idea
of
a
genus
and
is
expressed
by
a
word
but
because
our
reason
equipped
with
the
idea
of
space
and
the
power
of
creating
symbols
draws
these
multiple
elements
out
of
the
whole
it
does
not
follow
that
they
were
contained
in
it
for
within
the
whole
they
did
not
occupy
space
and
did
not
care
to
express
themselves
by
means
of
symbols
they
permeated
and
melted
into
one
another
associationism
thus
makes
the
mistake
of
constantly
replacing
the
concrete
phenomenon
which
takes
place
in
the
mind
by
the
artificial
reconstruction
of
it
given
by
philosophy
and
of
thus
confusing
the
explanation
of
the
fact
with
the
fact
itself
we
shall
perceive
this
more
clearly
as
we
consider
deeper
and
more
comprehensive
psychic
states
sidenote
failure
of
associationism
to
explain
the
deeper
states
of
the
self
the
self
comes
into
contact
with
the
external
world
at
its
surface
and
as
this
surface
retains
the
imprint
of
objects
the
self
will
associate
by
contiguity
terms
which
it
has
perceived
in
juxtaposition
it
is
connexions
of
this
kind
connexions
of
quite
simple
and
so
to
speak
impersonal
sensations
that
the
associationist
theory
fits
but
just
in
proportion
as
we
dig
below
the
surface
and
get
down
to
the
real
self
do
its
states
of
consciousness
cease
to
stand
in
juxtaposition
and
begin
to
permeate
and
melt
into
one
another
and
each
to
be
tinged
with
the
colouring
of
all
the
others
thus
each
of
us
has
his
own
way
of
loving
and
hating
and
this
love
or
this
hatred
reflects
his
whole
personality
language
however
denotes
these
states
by
the
same
words
in
every
case
so
that
it
has
been
able
to
fix
only
the
objective
and
impersonal
aspect
of
love
hate
and
the
thousand
emotions
which
stir
the
soul
we
estimate
the
talent
of
a
novelist
by
the
power
with
which
he
lifts
out
of
the
common
domain
to
which
language
had
thus
brought
them
down
feelings
and
ideas
to
which
he
strives
to
restore
by
adding
detail
to
detail
their
original
and
living
individuality
but
just
as
we
can
go
on
inserting
points
between
two
positions
of
a
moving
body
without
ever
filling
up
the
space
traversed
in
the
same
way
by
the
mere
fact
that
we
associate
states
with
states
and
that
these
states
are
set
side
by
side
instead
of
permeating
one
another
we
fail
to
translate
completely
what
our
soul
experiences
there
is
no
common
measure
between
mind
and
language
sidenote
the
self
is
not
an
aggregate
of
conscious
states
freedom
is
admitting
of
degrees
and
may
be
curtailed
by
education
therefore
it
is
only
an
inaccurate
psychology
misled
by
language
which
will
show
us
the
soul
determined
by
sympathy
aversion
or
hate
as
though
by
so
many
forces
pressing
upon
it
these
feelings
provided
that
they
go
deep
enough
each
make
up
the
whole
soul
since
the
whole
content
of
the
soul
is
reflected
in
each
of
them
to
say
that
the
soul
is
determined
under
the
influence
of
any
one
of
these
feelings
is
thus
to
recognize
that
it
is
the
associationist
reduces
the
self
to
an
aggregate
of
conscious
states
sensations
feelings
and
ideas
but
if
he
sees
in
these
various
states
no
more
than
is
expressed
in
their
name
if
he
retains
only
their
impersonal
aspect
he
may
set
them
side
by
side
for
ever
without
getting
anything
but
a
phantom
self
the
shadow
of
the
ego
projecting
itself
into
space
if
on
the
contrary
he
takes
these
psychic
states
with
the
particular
colouring
which
they
assume
in
the
case
of
a
definite
person
and
which
comes
to
each
of
them
by
reflection
from
all
the
others
then
there
is
no
need
to
associate
a
number
of
conscious
states
in
order
to
rebuild
the
person
for
the
whole
personality
is
in
a
single
one
of
them
provided
that
we
know
how
to
choose
it
and
the
outward
manifestation
of
this
inner
state
will
be
just
what
is
called
a
free
act
since
the
self
alone
will
have
been
the
author
of
it
and
since
it
will
express
the
whole
of
the
self
freedom
thus
understood
is
not
as
a
radically
libertarian
philosophy
would
have
it
it
admits
of
degrees
for
it
is
by
no
means
the
case
that
all
conscious
states
blend
with
one
another
as
raindrops
with
the
water
of
a
lake
the
self
in
so
far
as
it
has
to
do
with
a
homogeneous
space
develops
on
a
kind
of
surface
and
on
this
surface
independent
growths
may
form
and
float
thus
a
suggestion
received
in
the
hypnotic
state
is
not
incorporated
in
the
mass
of
conscious
states
but
endowed
with
a
life
of
its
own
it
will
usurp
the
whole
personality
when
its
time
comes
a
violent
anger
roused
by
some
accidental
circumstance
an
hereditary
vice
suddenly
emerging
from
the
obscure
depths
of
the
organism
to
the
surface
of
consciousness
will
act
almost
like
a
hypnotic
suggestion
alongside
these
independent
elements
there
may
be
found
more
complex
series
the
terms
of
which
do
permeate
one
another
but
which
never
succeed
in
blending
perfectly
with
the
whole
mass
of
the
self
such
is
the
system
of
feelings
and
ideas
which
are
the
result
of
an
education
not
properly
assimilated

education
which
appeals
to
the
memory
rather
than
to

upon
the
other
many

acts
are
exceptional
even
on
the
part
of
those
who
are
most
given
to
controlling
and
reasoning
out
what
they
do
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
we
generally
perceive
our
own
self
by
refraction
through
space
that
our
conscious
states
crystallize
into
words
and
that
our
living
and
concrete
self
thus
gets
covered
with
an
outer
crust
of
psychic
states
which
are
separated
from
one
another
and
consequently
fixed
we
added
that
for
the
convenience
of
language
and
the
promotion
of
social
relations
we
have
everything
to
gain
by
not
breaking
through
this
crust
and
by
assuming
it
to
give
an
exact
outline
of
the
form
of
the
object
which
it
covers
it
should
now
be
added
that
our
daily
actions
are
called
forth
not
so
much
by
our
feelings
themselves
which
are
constantly
changing
as
by
the
unchanging
images
with
which
these
feelings
are
bound
up
in
the
morning
when
the
hour
strikes
at
which
i
am
accustomed
to
rise
i
might
receive
this
impression
σὺν
ὄλῃ
τῇ
ψυχῆ
as
plato
says
i
might
let
it
blend
with
the
confused
mass
of
impressions
which
fill
my
mind
perhaps
in
that
case
it
would
not
determine
me
to
act
but
generally
this
impression
instead
of
disturbing
my
whole
consciousness
like
a
stone
which
falls
into
the
water
of
a
pond
merely
stirs
up
an
idea
which
is
so
to
speak
solidified
on
the
surface
the
idea
of
rising
and
attending
to
my
usual
occupations
this
impression
and
this
idea
have
in
the
end
become
tied
up
with
one
another
so
that
the
act
follows
the
impression
without
the
self
interfering
with
it
in
this
instance
i
am
a
conscious
automaton
and
i
am
so
because
i
have
everything
to
gain
by
being
so
it
will
be
found
that
the
majority
of
our
daily
actions
are
performed
in
this
way
and
that
owing
to
the
solidification
in
memory
of
such
and
such
sensations
feelings
or
ideas
impressions
from
the
outside
call
forth
movements
on
our
part
which
though
conscious
and
even
intelligent
have
many
points
of
resemblance
with
reflex
acts
it
is
to
these
acts
which
are
very
numerous
but
for
the
most
part
insignificant
that
the
associationist
theory
is
applicable
they
are
taken
all
together
the
substratum
of
our
free
activity
and
with
respect
to
this
activity
they
play
the
same
part
as
our
organic
functions
in
relation
to
the
whole
of
our
conscious
life
moreover
we
will
grant
to
determinism
that
we
often
resign
our
freedom
in
more
serious
circumstances
and
that
by
sluggishness
or
indolence
we
allow
this
same
local
process
to
run
its
course
when
our
whole
personality
ought
so
to
speak
to
vibrate
when
our
most
trustworthy
friends
agree
in
advising
us
to
take
some
important
step
the
sentiments
which
they
utter
with
so
much
insistence
lodge
on
the
surface
of
our
ego
and
there
get
solidified
in
the
same
way
as
the
ideas
of
which
we
spoke
just
now
little
by
little
they
will
form
a
thick
crust
which
will
cover
up
our
own
sentiments
we
shall
believe
that
we
are
acting
freely
and
it
is
only
by
looking
back
to
the
past
later
on
that
we
shall
see
how
much
we
were
mistaken
but
then
at
the
very
minute
when
the
act
is
going
to
be
performed
may
revolt
against
it
it
is
the
self
rushing
up
to
the
surface
it
is
the
outer
crust
bursting
suddenly
giving
way
to
an
irresistible
thrust
hence
in
the
depths
of
the
self
below
this
most
reasonable
pondering
over
most
reasonable
pieces
of
advice
something
else
was
going
on
a
gradual
heating
and
a
sudden
boiling
over
of
feelings
and
ideas
not
unperceived
but
rather
unnoticed
if
we
turn
back
to
them
and
carefully
scrutinize
our
memory
we
shall
see
that
we
had
ourselves
shaped
these
ideas
ourselves
lived
these
feelings
but
that
through
some
strange
reluctance
to
exercise
our
will
we
had
thrust
them
back
into
the
darkest
depths
of
our
soul
whenever
they
came
up
to
the
surface
and
this
is
why
we
seek
in
vain
to
explain
our
sudden
change
of
mind
by
the
visible
circumstances
which
preceded
it
we
wish
to
know
the
reason
why
we
have
made
up
our
mind
and
we
find
that
we
have
decided
without
any
reason
and
perhaps
even
against
every
reason
but
in
certain
cases
that
is
the
best
of
reasons
for
the
action
which
has
been
performed
does
not
then
express
some
superficial
idea
almost
external
to
ourselves
distinct
and
easy
to
account
for
it
agrees
with
the
whole
of
our
most
intimate
feelings
thoughts
and
aspirations
with
that
particular
conception
of
life
which
is
the
equivalent
of
all
our
past
experience
in
a
word
with
our
personal
idea
of
happiness
and
of
honour
hence
it
has
been
a
mistake
to
look
for
examples
in
the
ordinary
and
even
indifferent
circumstances
of
life
in
order
to
prove
that
man
is
capable
of
choosing
without
a
motive
it
might
easily
be
shown
that
these
insignificant
actions
are
bound
up
with
some
determining
reason
it
is
at
the
great
and
solemn
crisis
decisive
of
our
reputation
with
others
and
yet
more
with
ourselves
that
we
choose
in
defiance
of
what
is
conventionally
called
a
motive
and
this
absence
of
any
tangible
reason
is
the
more
striking
the
deeper
our
freedom
goes
sidenote
determinism
sets
on
the
one
side
the
ego
always
and
on
the
other
contrary
feelings
but
this
is
mere
symbolism
but
the
determinist
even
when
he
refrains
from
regarding
the
more
serious
emotions
or
psychic
states
as
forces
nevertheless
distinguishes
them
from
one
another
and
is
thus
led
to
a
mechanical
conception
of
the
self
he
will
show
us
this
self
hesitating
between
two
contrary
feelings
passing
from
one
to
the
other
and
finally
deciding
in
favour
of
one
of
them
the
self
and
the
feelings
which
stir
it
are
thus
treated
as
well
defined
objects
which
remain
identical
during
the
whole
of
the
process
but
if
it
is
always
the
same
self
which
deliberates
and
if
the
two
opposite
feelings
by
which
it
is
moved
do
not
change
how
in
virtue
of
this
very
principle
of
causality
which
determinism
appeals
to
will
the
self
ever
come
to
a
decision
the
truth
is
that
the
self
by
the
mere
fact
of
experiencing
the
first
feeling
has
already
changed
to
a
slight
extent
when
the
second
supervenes
all
the
time
that
the
deliberation
is
going
on
the
self
is
changing
and
is
consequently
modifying
the
two
feelings
which
agitate
it
a
dynamic
series
of
states
is
thus
formed
which
permeate
and
strengthen
one
another
and
which
will
lead
by
a
natural
evolution
to
a
free
act
but
determinism
ever
craving
for
symbolical
representation
can
not
help
substituting
words
for
the
opposite
feelings
which
share
the
ego
between
them
as
well
as
for
the
ego
itself
by
giving
first
the
person
and
then
the
feelings
by
which
he
is
moved
a
fixed
form
by
means
of
sharply
defined
words
it
deprives
them
in
advance
of
every
kind
of
living
activity
it
will
then
see
on
the
one
side
an
ego
always
and
on
the
other
contrary
feelings
also
which
dispute
for
its
possession
victory
will
necessarily
belong
to
the
stronger
but
this
mechanism
to
which
we
have
condemned
ourselves
in
advance
has
no
value
beyond
that
of
a
symbolical
representation
it
can
not
hold
good
against
the
witness
of
an
attentive
consciousness
which
shows
us
inner
dynamism
as
a
fact
sidenote
freedom
and
character
the
determinist
next
asks
could
your
act
have
been
different
or
can
it
be
foretold
in
short
we
are
free
when
our
acts
spring
from
our
whole
personality
when
they
express
it
when
that
indefinable
resemblance
to
it
which
one
sometimes
finds
between
the
artist
and
his
work
it
is
no
use
asserting
that
we
are
then
yielding
to
the
influence
of
our
character
our
character
is
still
ourselves
and
because
we
are
pleased
to
split
the
person
into
two
parts
so
that
by
an
effort
of
abstraction
we
may
consider
in
turn
the
self
which
feels
or
thinks
and
the
self
which
acts
it
would
be
very
strange
to
conclude
that
one
of
the
two
selves
is
coercing
the
other
those
who
ask
whether
we
are
free
to
alter
our
character
lay
themselves
open
to
the
same
objection
certainly
our
character
is
altering
imperceptibly
every
day
and
our
freedom
would
suffer
if
these
new
acquisitions
were
grafted
on
to
our
self
and
not
blended
with
it
but
as
soon
as
this
blending
takes
place
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
change
which
has
supervened
in
our
character
belongs
to
us
that
we
have
appropriated
it
in
a
word
if
it
is
agreed
to
call
every
act
free
which
springs
from
the
self
and
from
the
self
alone
the
act
which
bears
the
mark
of
our
personality
is
truly
free
for
our
self
alone
will
lay
claim
to
its
paternity
it
would
thus
be
recognized
that
free
will
is
a
fact
if
it
were
agreed
to
look
for
it
in
a
certain
characteristic
of
the
decision
which
is
taken
in
the
free
act
itself
but
the
determinist
feeling
that
he
can
not
retain
his
hold
on
this
position
takes
refuge
in
the
past
or
the
future
sometimes
he
transfers
himself
in
thought
to
some
earlier
period
and
asserts
the
necessary
determination
from
this
very
moment
of
the
act
which
is
to
come
sometimes
assuming
in
advance
that
the
act
is
already
performed
he
claims
that
it
could
not
have
taken
place
in
any
other
way
the
opponents
of
determinism
themselves
willingly
follow
it
on
to
this
new
ground
and
agree
to
introduce
into
their
definition
of
our
free
act
not
without
some
risk
the
anticipation
of
what
we
might
do
and
the
recollection
of
some
other
decision
which
we
might
have
taken
it
is
advisable
then
that
we
should
place
ourselves
at
this
new
point
of
view
and
setting
aside
all
translation
into
words
all
symbolism
in
space
attend
to
what
pure
consciousness
alone
shows
us
about
an
action
that
has
come
to
pass
or
an
action
which
is
still
to
come
the
original
error
of
determinism
and
the
mistake
of
its
opponents
will
thus
be
grasped
on
another
side
in
so
far
as
they
bear
explicitly
on
a
certain
misconception
of
duration
sidenote
determinist
and
libertarian
doctrines
of
possible
acts
to
be
conscious
of
free
will
says
stuart
mill
must
mean
to
be
conscious
before
i
have
decided
that
i
am
able
to
decide
either
way
this
is
really
the
way
in
which
the
defenders
of
free
will
understand
it
and
they
assert
that
when
we
perform
an
action
freely
some
other
action
would
have
been
equally
possible
on
this
point
they
appeal
to
the
testimony
of
consciousness
which
shows
us
beyond
the
act
itself
the
power
of
deciding
in
favour
of
the
opposite
course
inversely
determinism
claims
that
given
certain
antecedents
only
one
resultant
action
was
possible
when
we
think
of
ourselves
hypothetically
stuart
mill
goes
on
as
having
acted
otherwise
than
we
did
we
always
suppose
a
difference
in
the
antecedents
we
picture
ourselves
as
having
known
something
that
we
did
not
know
or
not
known
something
that
we
did
know
and
faithful
to
his
principle
the
english
philosopher
assigns
consciousness
the
rôle
of
informing
us
about
what
is
not
about
what
might
be
we
shall
not
insist
for
the
moment
on
this
last
point
we
reserve
the
question
in
what
sense
the
ego
perceives
itself
as
a
determining
cause
but
beside
this
psychological
question
there
is
another
belonging
rather
to
metaphysics
which
the
determinists
and
their
opponents
solve
along
opposite
lines
the
argument
of
the
former
implies
that
there
is
only
one
possible
act
corresponding
to
given
antecedents
the
believers
in
free
will
assume
on
the
other
hand
that
the
same
series
could
issue
in
several
different
acts
equally
possible
it
is
on
this
question
of
the
equal
possibility
of
two
contrary
actions
or
volitions
that
we
shall
first
dwell
perhaps
we
shall
thus
gather
some
indication
as
to
the
nature
of
the
operation
by
which
the
will
makes
its
choice
sidenote
geometrical
and
thereby
deceptive
representation
of
the
process
of
coming
to
a
decision
i
hesitate
between
two
possible
actions
x
and
y
and
i
go
in
turn
from
one
to
the
other
this
means
that
i
pass
through
a
series
of
states
and
that
these
states
can
be
divided
into
two
groups
according
as
i
incline
more
towards
x
or
in
the
contrary
direction
indeed
these
opposite
inclinations
alone
have
a
real
existence
and
x
and
y
are
two
symbols
by
which
i
represent
at
their
so
to
speak
two
different
tendencies
of
my
personality
at
successive
moments
of
duration
let
us
then
rather
denote
the
tendencies
themselves
by
x
and
y
will
this
new
notation
give
a
more
faithful
image
of
the
concrete
reality
it
must
be
noticed
as
we
said
above
that
the
self
grows
expands
and
changes
as
it
passes
through
the
two
contrary
states
if
not
how
would
it
ever
come
to
a
decision
hence
there
are
not
exactly
two
contrary
states
but
a
large
number
of
successive
and
different
states
within
which
i
distinguish
by
an
effort
of
imagination
two
opposite
directions
illustration
thus
we
shall
get
still
nearer
the
reality
by
agreeing
to
use
the
invariable
signs
x
and
y
to
denote
not
these
tendencies
or
states
themselves
since
they
are
constantly
changing
but
the
two
different
directions
which
our
imagination
ascribes
to
them
for
the
greater
convenience
of
language
it
will
also
be
understood
that
these
are
symbolical
representations
that
in
reality
there
are
not
two
tendencies
or
even
two
directions
but
a
self
which
lives
and
develops
by
means
of
its
very
hesitations
until
the
free
action
drops
from
it
like
an
fruit
sidenote
the
only
reality
is
the
living
developing
self
in
which
we
distinguish
by
abstraction
two
opposite
tendencies
or
directions
but
this
conception
of
voluntary
activity
does
not
satisfy
common
sense
because
being
essentially
a
devotee
of
mechanism
it
loves
distinctions
those
which
are
expressed
by
sharply
defined
words
or
by
different
positions
in
space
hence
it
will
picture
a
self
which
after
having
traversed
a
series
m
o
of
conscious
states
when
it
reaches
the
point
o
finds
before
it
two
directions
o
x
and
o
y
equally
open
these
directions
thus
become
real
paths
into
which
the
highroad
of
consciousness
leads
and
it
depends
only
on
the
self
which
of
them
is
entered
upon
in
short
the
continuous
and
living
activity
of
this
self
in
which
we
have
distinguished
by
abstraction
only
two
opposite
directions
is
replaced
by
these
directions
themselves
transformed
into
indifferent
inert
things
awaiting
our
choice
but
then
we
must
certainly
transfer
the
activity
of
the
self
somewhere
or
other
we
will
put
it
according
to
this
hypothesis
at
the
point
o
we
will
say
that
the
self
when
it
reaches
o
and
finds
two
courses
open
to
it
hesitates
deliberates
and
finally
decides
in
favour
of
one
of
them
as
we
find
it
difficult
to
picture
the
double
direction
of
the
conscious
activity
in
all
the
phases
of
its
continuous
development
we
separate
off
these
two
tendencies
on
the
one
hand
and
the
activity
of
the
self
on
the
other
we
thus
get
an
impartially
active
ego
hesitating
between
two
inert
and
as
it
were
solidified
courses
of
action
now
if
it
decides
in
favour
of
o
x
the
line
o
y
will
nevertheless
remain
if
it
chooses
o
y
the
path
o
x
will
remain
open
waiting
in
case
the
self
retraces
its
steps
in
order
to
make
use
of
it
it
is
in
this
sense
that
we
say
when
speaking
of
a
free
act
that
the
contrary
action
was
equally
possible
and
even
if
we
do
not
draw
a
geometrical
figure
on
paper
we
involuntarily
and
almost
unconsciously
think
of
it
as
soon
as
we
distinguish
in
the
free
act
a
number
of
successive
phases
the
of
opposite
motives
and
thus
hiding
the
geometrical
symbolism
under
a
kind
of
verbal
crystallization
now
it
is
easy
to
see
that
this
really
mechanical
conception
of
freedom
issues
naturally
and
logically
in
the
most
unbending
determinism
sidenote
if
this
symbolism
represents
the
facts
the
activity
of
the
self
has
always
tended
in
one
direction
and
determinism
results
the
living
activity
of
the
self
in
which
we
distinguish
by
abstraction
two
opposite
tendencies
will
finally
issue
either
at
x
or
y
now
since
it
is
agreed
to
localize
the
double
activity
of
the
self
at
the
point
o
there
is
no
reason
to
separate
this
activity
from
the
act
in
which
it
will
issue
and
which
forms
part
and
parcel
of
it
and
if
experience
shows
that
the
decision
has
been
in
favour
of
x
it
is
not
a
neutral
activity
which
should
be
placed
at
the
point
o
but
an
activity
tending
in
advance
in
the
direction
o
x
in
spite
of
apparent
hesitations
if
on
the
contrary
observation
proves
that
the
decision
has
been
in
favour
of
y
we
must
infer
that
the
activity
localized
by
us
at
the
point
o
was
bent
in
this
second
direction
in
spite
of
some
oscillations
towards
the
first
to
assert
that
the
self
when
it
reaches
the
point
o
chooses
indifferently
between
x
and
y
is
to
stop
half
way
in
the
course
of
our
geometrical
symbolism
it
is
to
separate
off
at
the
point
o
only
a
part
of
this
continuous
activity
in
which
we
undoubtedly
distinguished
two
different
directions
but
which
in
addition
has
gone
on
to
x
or
y
why
not
take
this
last
fact
into
account
as
well
as
the
other
two
why
not
assign
it
the
place
that
belongs
to
it
in
the
symbolical
figure
which
we
have
just
constructed
but
if
the
self
when
it
reaches
the
point
o
is
already
determined
in
one
direction
there
is
no
use
in
the
other
way
remaining
open
the
self
can
not
take
it
and
the
same
rough
symbolism
which
was
meant
to
show
the
contingency
of
the
action
performed
ends
by
a
natural
extension
in
proving
its
absolute
necessity
sidenote
libertarians
ignore
the
fact
that
one
path
has
been
chosen
and
not
the
other
in
short
defenders
and
opponents
of
free
will
agree
in
holding
that
the
action
is
preceded
by
a
kind
of
mechanical
oscillation
between
two
points
x
and
y
if
i
decide
in
favour
of
x
the
former
will
tell
me
you
hesitated
and
deliberated
therefore
y
was
possible
the
others
will
answer
you
chose
x
therefore
you
had
some
reason
for
doing
so
and
those
who
declare
that
y
was
equally
possible
forget
this
reason
they
leave
aside
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
problem
now
if
i
dig
deeper
underneath
these
two
opposite
solutions
i
discover
a
common
postulate
both
take
up
their
position
after
the
action
x
has
been
performed
and
represent
the
process
of
my
voluntary
activity
by
a
path
m
o
which
branches
off
at
the
point
o
the
lines
o
x
and
o
y
symbolizing
the
two
directions
which
abstraction
distinguishes
within
the
continuous
activity
of
which
x
is
the
goal
but
while
the
determinists
take
account
of
all
that
they
know
and
note
that
the
path
m
o
x
has
been
traversed
their
opponents
mean
to
ignore
one
of
the
data
with
which
they
have
constructed
the
figure
and
after
having
traced
out
the
lines
o
x
and
o
y
which
should
together
represent
the
progress
of
the
activity
of
the
self
they
bring
back
the
self
to
the
point
o
to
oscillate
there
until
further
orders
sidenote
but
the
figure
merely
gives
the
stereotyped
memory
of
the
process
and
not
the
dynamic
progress
which
issued
in
the
set
it
should
not
be
forgotten
indeed
that
the
figure
which
is
really
a
splitting
of
our
psychic
activity
in
space
is
purely
symbolical
and
as
such
can
not
be
constructed
unless
we
adopt
the
hypothesis
that
our
deliberation
is
finished
and
our
mind
made
up
if
you
trace
it
beforehand
act
you
assume
that
you
have
reached
the
end
and
are
present
in
imagination
at
the
final
act
in
short
this
figure
does
not
show
me
the
deed
in
the
doing
but
the
deed
already
done
do
not
ask
me
then
whether
the
self
having
traversed
the
path
m
o
and
decided
in
favour
of
x
could
or
could
not
choose
y
i
should
answer
that
the
question
is
meaningless
because
there
is
no
line
m
o
no
point
o
no
path
o
x
no
direction
o
y
to
ask
such
a
question
is
to
admit
the
possibility
of
adequately
representing
time
by
space
and
a
succession
by
a
simultaneity
it
is
to
ascribe
to
the
figure
we
have
traced
the
value
of
a
description
and
not
merely
of
a
symbol
it
is
to
believe
that
it
is
possible
to
follow
the
process
of
psychic
activity
on
this
figure
like
the
march
of
an
army
on
a
map
we
have
been
present
at
the
deliberation
of
the
self
in
all
its
phases
until
the
act
was
performed
then
recapitulating
the
terms
of
the
series
we
perceive
succession
under
the
form
of
simultaneity
we
project
time
into
space
and
we
base
our
reasoning
consciously
or
unconsciously
on
this
geometrical
figure
but
this
figure
represents
a
and
not
a
it
corresponds
in
its
inertness
to
a
kind
of
stereotyped
memory
of
the
whole
process
of
deliberation
and
the
final
decision
arrived
at
how
could
it
give
us
the
least
idea
of
the
concrete
movement
the
dynamic
progress
by
which
the
deliberation
issued
in
the
act
and
yet
once
the
figure
is
constructed
we
go
back
in
imagination
into
the
past
and
will
have
it
that
our
psychic
activity
has
followed
exactly
the
path
traced
out
by
the
figure
we
thus
fall
into
the
mistake
which
has
been
pointed
out
above
we
give
a
mechanical
explanation
of
a
fact
and
then
substitute
the
explanation
for
the
fact
itself
hence
we
encounter
insuperable
difficulties
from
the
very
beginning
if
the
two
courses
were
equally
possible
how
have
we
made
our
choice
if
only
one
of
them
was
possible
why
did
we
believe
ourselves
free
and
we
do
not
see
that
both
questions
come
back
to
this
is
time
space
sidenote
fundamental
error
is
confusion
of
time
and
space
the
self
infallible
in
affirming
immediate
experience
of
freedom
but
can
not
explain
it
if
i
glance
over
a
road
marked
on
the
map
and
follow
it
up
to
a
certain
point
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
my
turning
back
and
trying
to
find
out
whether
it
branches
off
anywhere
but
time
is
not
a
line
along
which
one
can
pass
again
certainly
once
it
has
elapsed
we
are
justified
in
picturing
the
successive
moments
as
external
to
one
another
and
in
thus
thinking
of
a
line
traversing
space
but
it
must
then
be
understood
that
this
line
does
not
symbolize
the
time
which
is
passing
but
the
time
which
has
passed
defenders
and
opponents
of
free
will
alike
forget
this
the
former
when
they
assert
and
the
latter
when
they
deny
the
possibility
of
acting
differently
from
what
we
have
done
the
former
reason
thus
the
path
is
not
yet
traced
out
therefore
it
may
take
any
direction
whatever
to
which
the
answer
is
you
forget
that
it
is
not
possible
to
speak
of
a
path
till
the
action
is
performed
but
then
it
will
have
been
traced
out
the
latter
say
the
path
has
been
traced
out
in
such
and
such
a
way
therefore
its
possible
direction
was
not
any
direction
whatever
but
only
this
one
direction
to
which
the
answer
is
before
the
path
was
traced
out
there
was
no
direction
either
possible
or
impossible
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
there
could
not
yet
be
any
question
of
a
path
get
rid
of
this
clumsy
symbolism
the
idea
of
which
besets
you
without
your
knowing
it
you
will
see
that
the
argument
of
the
determinists
assumes
this
puerile
form
the
act
once
performed
is
performed
and
that
their
opponents
reply
the
act
before
being
performed
was
not
yet
performed
in
other
words
the
question
of
freedom
remains
after
this
discussion
exactly
where
it
was
to
begin
with
nor
must
we
be
surprised
at
it
since
freedom
must
be
sought
in
a
certain
shade
or
quality
of
the
action
itself
and
not
in
the
relation
of
this
act
to
what
it
is
not
or
to
what
it
might
have
been
all
the
difficulty
arises
from
the
fact
that
both
parties
picture
the
deliberation
under
the
form
of
an
oscillation
in
space
while
it
really
consists
in
a
dynamic
progress
in
which
the
self
and
its
motives
like
real
living
beings
are
in
a
constant
state
of
becoming
the
self
infallible
when
it
affirms
its
immediate
experiences
feels
itself
free
and
says
so
but
as
soon
as
it
tries
to
explain
its
freedom
to
itself
it
no
longer
perceives
itself
except
by
a
kind
of
refraction
through
space
hence
a
symbolism
of
a
mechanical
kind
equally
incapable
of
proving
disproving
or
illustrating
free
will
sidenote
is
prediction
of
an
act
possible
probable
and
infallible
conclusions
but
determinism
will
not
admit
itself
beaten
and
putting
the
question
in
a
new
form
it
will
say
let
us
leave
aside
actions
already
performed
let
us
consider
only
actions
that
are
to
come
the
question
is
whether
knowing
from
now
onwards
all
the
future
antecedents
some
higher
intelligence
would
not
be
able
to
predict
with
absolute
certainty
the
decision
which
will
result
we
gladly
agree
to
the
question
being
put
in
these
terms
it
will
give
us
a
chance
of
stating
our
own
theory
with
greater
precision
but
we
shall
first
draw
a
distinction
between
those
who
think
that
the
knowledge
of
antecedents
would
enable
us
to
state
a
conclusion
and
those
who
speak
of
an
foresight
to
say
that
a
certain
friend
under
certain
circumstances
will
very
probably
act
in
a
certain
way
is
not
so
much
to
predict
the
future
conduct
of
our
friend
as
to
pass
a
judgment
on
his
present
character
that
is
to
say
on
his
past
although
our
feelings
our
ideas
our
character
are
constantly
altering
a
sudden
change
is
seldom
observed
and
it
is
still
more
seldom
that
we
can
not
say
of
a
person
whom
we
know
that
certain
actions
seem
to
accord
fairly
well
with
his
nature
and
that
certain
others
are
absolutely
inconsistent
with
it
all
philosophers
will
agree
on
this
point
for
to
say
that
a
given
action
is
consistent
or
inconsistent
with
the
present
character
of
a
person
whom
one
knows
is
not
to
bind
the
future
to
the
present
but
the
determinist
goes
much
further
he
asserts
that
our
solution
is
provisional
simply
because
we
never
know
all
the
conditions
of
the
problem
that
our
forecast
would
gain
in
probability
in
proportion
as
we
were
provided
with
a
larger
number
of
these
conditions
that
therefore
complete
and
perfect
knowledge
of
all
the
antecedents
without
any
exception
would
make
our
forecast
infallibly
true
such
then
is
the
hypothesis
which
we
have
to
examine
sidenote
to
know
the
antecedents
and
conditions
of
an
action
is
to
be
actually
performing
it
for
the
sake
of
greater
definiteness
let
us
imagine
a
person
called
upon
to
make
a
seemingly
free
decision
under
serious
circumstances
we
shall
call
him
peter
the
question
is
whether
a
philosopher
paul
living
at
the
same
period
as
peter
or
if
you
prefer
a
few
centuries
before
would
have
been
able
knowing
the
conditions
under
which
peter
acts
to
foretell
with
certainty
the
choice
which
peter
made
there
are
several
ways
of
picturing
the
mental
condition
of
a
person
at
a
given
moment
we
try
to
do
it
when
we
read
a
novel
but
whatever
care
the
author
may
have
taken
in
depicting
the
feelings
of
his
hero
and
even
in
tracing
back
his
history
the
end
foreseen
or
unforeseen
will
add
something
to
the
idea
which
we
had
formed
of
the
character
the
character
therefore
was
only
imperfectly
known
to
us
in
truth
the
deeper
psychic
states
those
which
are
translated
by
free
acts
express
and
sum
up
the
whole
of
our
past
history
if
paul
knows
all
the
conditions
under
which
peter
acts
we
must
suppose
that
no
detail
of
peter
life
escapes
him
and
that
his
imagination
reconstructs
and
even
lives
over
again
peter
history
but
we
must
here
make
a
vital
distinction
when
i
myself
pass
through
a
certain
psychic
state
i
know
exactly
the
intensity
of
this
state
and
its
importance
in
relation
to
the
others
not
by
measurement
or
comparison
but
because
the
intensity
of
a
feeling
is
nothing
else
than
the
feeling
itself
on
the
other
hand
if
i
try
to
give
you
an
account
of
this
psychic
state
i
shall
be
unable
to
make
you
realize
its
intensity
except
by
some
definite
sign
of
a
mathematical
kind
i
shall
have
to
measure
its
importance
compare
it
with
what
goes
before
and
what
follows
in
short
determine
the
part
which
it
plays
in
the
final
act
and
i
shall
say
that
it
is
more
or
less
intense
more
or
less
important
according
as
the
final
act
is
explained
by
it
or
apart
from
it
on
the
other
hand
for
my
own
consciousness
which
perceived
this
inner
state
there
was
no
need
of
a
comparison
of
this
kind
the
intensity
was
given
to
it
as
an
inexpressible
quality
of
the
state
itself
in
other
words
the
intensity
of
a
psychic
state
is
not
given
to
consciousness
as
a
special
sign
accompanying
this
state
and
denoting
its
power
like
an
exponent
in
algebra
we
have
shown
above
that
it
expresses
rather
its
shade
its
characteristic
colouring
and
that
if
it
is
a
question
of
a
feeling
for
example
its
intensity
consists
in
being
felt
hence
we
have
to
distinguish
two
ways
of
assimilating
the
conscious
states
of
other
people
the
one
dynamic
which
consists
in
experiencing
them
oneself
the
other
static
which
consists
in
substituting
for
the
consciousness
of
these
states
their
image
or
rather
their
intellectual
symbol
their
idea
in
this
case
the
conscious
states
are
instead
of
being
but
then
to
the
image
of
the
psychic
states
themselves
some
indication
of
their
should
be
added
since
they
no
longer
act
on
the
person
in
whose
mind
they
are
pictured
and
the
latter
has
no
longer
any
chance
of
experiencing
their
force
by
actually
feeling
them
now
this
indication
itself
will
necessarily
assume
a
quantitative
character
it
will
be
pointed
out
for
example
that
a
certain
feeling
has
more
strength
than
another
feeling
that
it
is
necessary
to
take
more
account
of
it
that
it
has
played
a
greater
part
and
how
could
this
be
known
unless
the
later
history
of
the
person
were
known
in
advance
with
the
precise
actions
in
which
this
multiplicity
of
states
or
inclinations
has
issued
therefore
if
paul
is
to
have
an
adequate
idea
of
peter
state
at
any
moment
of
his
history
there
are
only
two
courses
open
either
like
a
novelist
who
knows
whither
he
is
conducting
his
characters
paul
must
already
know
peter
final
act
and
must
thus
be
able
to
supplement
his
mental
image
of
the
successive
states
through
which
peter
is
going
to
pass
by
some
indication
of
their
value
in
relation
to
the
whole
of
peter
history
or
he
must
make
up
his
mind
to
pass
through
these
different
states
not
in
imagination
but
in
reality
the
former
hypothesis
must
be
put
on
one
side
since
the
very
point
at
issue
is
whether
the
antecedents
being
given
paul
will
be
able
to
foresee
the
final
act
we
find
ourselves
compelled
therefore
to
alter
radically
the
idea
which
we
had
formed
of
paul
he
is
not
as
we
had
thought
at
first
a
spectator
whose
eyes
pierce
the
future
but
an
actor
who
plays
part
in
advance
and
notice
that
you
can
not
exempt
him
from
any
detail
of
this
part
for
the
most
events
have
their
importance
in
a
and
even
supposing
that
they
have
not
you
can
not
decide
that
they
are
insignificant
except
in
relation
to
the
final
act
which
by
hypothesis
is
not
given
neither
have
you
the
right
to
cut
short
were
it
only
by
a
second
the
different
states
of
consciousness
through
which
paul
is
going
to
pass
before
peter
for
the
effects
of
the
same
feeling
for
example
go
on
accumulating
at
every
moment
of
duration
and
the
sum
total
of
these
effects
could
not
be
realized
all
at
once
unless
one
knew
the
importance
of
the
feeling
taken
in
its
totality
in
relation
to
the
final
act
which
is
the
very
thing
that
is
supposed
to
remain
unknown
but
if
peter
and
paul
have
experienced
the
same
feelings
in
the
same
order
if
their
minds
have
the
same
history
how
will
you
distinguish
one
from
the
other
will
it
be
by
the
body
in
which
they
dwell
they
would
then
always
differ
in
some
respect
that
at
no
moment
of
their
history
would
they
have
a
mental
picture
of
the
same
body
will
it
be
by
the
place
which
they
occupy
in
time
in
that
case
they
would
no
longer
be
present
at
the
same
events
now
by
hypothesis
they
have
the
same
past
and
the
same
present
having
the
same
experience
you
must
now
make
up
your
mind
about
it
peter
and
paul
are
one
and
the
same
person
whom
you
call
peter
when
he
acts
and
paul
when
you
recapitulate
his
history
the
more
complete
you
made
the
sum
of
the
conditions
which
when
known
would
have
enabled
you
to
predict
peter
future
action
the
closer
became
your
grasp
of
his
existence
and
the
nearer
you
came
to
living
his
life
over
again
down
to
its
smallest
details
you
thus
reached
the
very
moment
when
the
action
taking
place
there
was
no
longer
anything
to
be
foreseen
but
only
something
to
be
done
here
again
any
attempt
to
reconstruct
ideally
an
act
really
ends
in
the
mere
witnessing
of
the
act
whilst
it
is
being
performed
or
when
it
is
already
done
sidenote
hence
meaningless
to
ask
whether
an
act
can
be
foreseen
when
its
antecedents
are
given
hence
it
is
a
question
devoid
of
meaning
to
ask
could
or
could
not
the
act
be
foreseen
given
the
sum
total
of
its
antecedents
for
there
are
two
ways
of
assimilating
these
antecedents
the
one
dynamic
the
other
static
in
the
first
case
we
shall
be
led
by
imperceptible
steps
to
identify
ourselves
with
the
person
we
are
dealing
with
to
pass
through
the
same
series
of
states
and
thus
to
get
back
to
the
very
moment
at
which
the
act
is
performed
hence
there
can
no
longer
be
any
question
of
foreseeing
it
in
the
second
case
we
presuppose
the
final
act
by
the
mere
fact
of
annexing
to
the
qualitative
description
of
the
previous
states
the
quantitative
appreciation
of
their
importance
here
again
the
one
party
is
led
merely
to
realize
that
the
act
is
not
yet
performed
when
it
is
to
be
performed
and
the
other
that
when
performed
it
is
performed
this
like
the
previous
discussion
leaves
the
question
of
freedom
exactly
where
it
was
to
begin
with
sidenote
the
two
fallacies
involved
regarding
intensity
as
a
magnitude
not
a
quality
substituting
material
symbol
for
dynamic
process
by
going
deeper
into
this
twofold
argument
we
shall
find
at
its
very
root
the
two
fundamental
illusions
of
the
reflective
consciousness
the
first
consists
in
regarding
intensity
as
a
mathematical
property
of
psychic
states
and
not
as
we
said
at
the
beginning
of
this
essay
as
a
special
quality
as
a
particular
shade
of
these
various
states
the
second
consists
in
substituting
for
the
concrete
reality
or
dynamic
progress
which
consciousness
perceives
the
material
symbol
of
this
progress
when
it
has
already
reached
its
end
that
is
to
say
of
the
act
already
accomplished
together
with
the
series
of
its
antecedents
certainly
once
the
final
act
is
completed
i
can
ascribe
to
all
the
antecedents
their
proper
value
and
picture
the
interplay
of
these
various
elements
as
a
conflict
or
a
composition
of
forces
but
to
ask
whether
the
antecedents
being
known
as
well
as
their
value
one
could
foretell
the
final
act
is
to
beg
the
question
it
is
to
forget
that
we
can
not
know
the
value
of
the
antecedents
without
knowing
the
final
act
which
is
the
very
thing
that
is
not
yet
known
it
is
to
suppose
wrongly
that
the
symbolical
diagram
which
we
draw
in
our
own
way
for
representing
the
action
has
been
drawn
by
the
action
itself
progressing
and
drawn
by
it
in
an
automatic
manner
sidenote
claiming
to
foresee
an
action
always
comes
back
to
confusing
time
with
space
now
in
these
two
illusions
themselves
a
third
one
is
involved
and
you
will
see
that
the
question
whether
the
act
could
or
could
not
be
foreseen
always
comes
back
to
this
is
time
space
you
begin
by
setting
side
by
side
in
some
ideal
space
the
conscious
states
which
succeed
one
another
in
peter
mind
and
you
perceive
his
life
as
a
kind
of
path
m
o
x
y
traced
out
by
a
moving
body
m
in
space
you
then
blot
out
in
thought
the
part
o
x
y
of
this
curve
and
you
inquire
whether
knowing
m
o
you
would
have
been
able
to
determine
the
portion
o
x
of
the
curve
which
the
moving
body
describes
beyond
o
illustration
such
is
in
the
main
the
question
which
you
put
when
you
bring
in
a
philosopher
paul
who
lives
before
peter
and
has
to
picture
to
himself
the
conditions
under
which
peter
will
act
you
thus
materialize
these
conditions
you
make
the
time
to
come
into
a
road
already
marked
out
across
the
plain
which
we
can
contemplate
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
even
if
we
have
not
traversed
it
and
are
never
to
do
so
but
now
you
soon
notice
that
the
knowledge
of
the
part
m
o
of
the
curve
would
not
be
enough
unless
you
were
shown
the
position
of
the
points
of
this
line
not
only
in
relation
to
one
another
but
also
in
relation
to
the
points
of
the
whole
line
m
o
x
y
which
would
amount
to
being
given
in
advance
the
very
elements
which
have
to
be
determined
so
you
then
alter
your
hypothesis
you
realize
that
time
does
not
require
to
be
seen
but
to
be
lived
and
hence
you
conclude
that
if
your
knowledge
of
the
line
m
o
was
not
a
sufficient
datum
the
reason
must
have
been
that
you
looked
at
it
from
the
outside
instead
of
identifying
yourself
with
the
point
m
which
describes
not
only
m
o
but
also
the
whole
curve
and
thus
making
its
movement
your
own
therefore
you
persuade
paul
to
come
and
coincide
with
peter
and
naturally
then
it
is
the
line
m
o
x
y
which
paul
traces
out
in
space
since
by
hypothesis
peter
describes
this
line
but
in
no
wise
do
you
prove
thus
that
paul
foresaw
peter
action
you
only
show
that
peter
acted
in
the
way
he
did
since
paul
became
peter
it
is
true
that
you
then
come
back
unwittingly
to
your
former
hypothesis
because
you
continually
confuse
the
line
m
o
x
y
in
its
tracing
with
the
line
m
o
x
y
already
traced
that
is
to
say
time
with
space
after
causing
paul
to
come
down
and
identify
himself
with
peter
as
long
as
was
required
you
let
him
go
up
again
and
resume
his
former
post
of
observation
no
wonder
if
he
then
perceives
the
line
m
o
x
y
complete
he
himself
has
just
been
completing
it
sidenote
confusion
arising
from
prediction
of
astronomical
phenomena
what
makes
the
confusion
a
natural
and
almost
an
unavoidable
one
is
that
science
seems
to
point
to
many
cases
where
we
do
anticipate
the
future
do
we
not
determine
beforehand
the
conjunctions
of
heavenly
bodies
solar
and
lunar
eclipses
in
short
the
greater
number
of
astronomical
phenomena
does
not
then
the
human
intellect
embrace
in
the
present
moment
immense
intervals
of
duration
still
to
come
no
doubt
it
does
but
an
anticipation
of
this
kind
has
not
the
slightest
resemblance
to
the
anticipation
of
a
voluntary
act
indeed
as
we
shall
see
the
reasons
which
render
it
possible
to
foretell
an
astronomical
phenomenon
are
the
very
ones
which
prevent
us
from
determining
in
advance
an
act
which
springs
from
our
free
activity
for
the
future
of
the
material
universe
although
contemporaneous
with
the
future
of
a
conscious
being
has
no
analogy
to
it
sidenote
illustration
from
hypothetical
acceleration
of
physical
movements
in
order
to
put
our
finger
on
this
vital
difference
let
us
assume
for
a
moment
that
some
mischievous
illustration
genius
more
powerful
still
than
the
mischievous
genius
conjured
up
by
descartes
decreed
that
all
the
movements
of
the
universe
should
go
twice
as
fast
there
would
be
no
change
in
astronomical
phenomena
or
at
any
rate
in
the
equations
which
enable
us
to
foresee
them
for
in
these
equations
the
symbol
does
not
stand
for
a
duration
but
for
a
relation
between
two
durations
for
a
certain
number
of
units
of
time
in
short
for
a
certain
number
of
these
simultaneities
these
coincidences
would
still
take
place
in
equal
number
only
the
intervals
which
separate
them
would
have
diminished
but
these
intervals
never
make
their
appearance
in
our
calculations
now
these
intervals
are
just
duration
duration
which
our
consciousness
perceives
and
our
consciousness
would
soon
inform
us
of
a
shortening
of
the
day
if
we
had
not
experienced
the
usual
amount
of
duration
between
sunrise
and
sunset
no
doubt
it
would
not
measure
this
shortening
and
perhaps
it
would
not
even
perceive
it
immediately
as
a
change
of
quantity
but
it
would
realize
in
some
way
or
other
a
decline
in
the
usual
storing
up
of
experience
a
change
in
the
progress
usually
accomplished
between
sunrise
and
sunset
sidenote
astronomical
prophecy
such
as
acceleration
now
when
an
astronomer
foretells
a
lunar
eclipse
he
merely
exercises
in
his
own
way
the
power
which
we
have
ascribed
to
our
mischievous
genius
he
decrees
that
time
shall
go
ten
times
a
hundred
times
a
thousand
times
as
fast
and
he
has
a
right
to
do
so
since
all
that
he
thus
changes
is
the
nature
of
the
conscious
intervals
and
since
these
intervals
by
hypothesis
do
not
enter
into
the
calculations
therefore
into
a
psychological
duration
of
a
few
seconds
he
may
put
several
years
even
several
centuries
of
astronomical
time
that
is
his
procedure
when
he
traces
in
advance
the
path
of
a
heavenly
body
or
represents
it
by
an
equation
what
he
does
is
nothing
but
establishing
a
series
of
relations
of
position
between
this
body
and
other
given
bodies
a
series
of
simultaneities
and
coincidences
a
series
of
numerical
relations
as
for
duration
properly
so
called
it
remains
outside
the
calculation
and
could
only
be
perceived
by
a
consciousness
capable
of
living
through
the
intervals
and
in
fact
living
the
intervals
themselves
instead
of
merely
perceiving
their
extremities
indeed
it
is
even
conceivable
that
this
consciousness
could
live
so
slow
and
lazy
a
life
as
to
take
in
the
whole
path
of
the
heavenly
body
in
a
single
perception
just
as
we
do
when
we
perceive
the
successive
positions
of
a
shooting
star
as
one
line
of
fire
such
a
consciousness
would
find
itself
really
in
the
same
conditions
in
which
the
astronomer
places
himself
ideally
it
would
see
in
the
present
what
the
astronomer
perceives
in
the
future
in
truth
if
the
latter
foresees
a
future
phenomenon
it
is
only
on
condition
of
making
it
to
a
certain
extent
a
present
phenomenon
or
at
least
of
enormously
reducing
the
interval
which
separates
us
from
it
in
short
the
time
of
which
we
speak
in
astronomy
is
a
number
and
the
nature
of
the
units
of
this
number
can
not
be
specified
in
our
calculations
we
may
therefore
assume
them
to
be
as
small
as
we
please
provided
that
the
same
hypothesis
is
extended
to
the
whole
series
of
operations
and
that
the
successive
relations
of
position
in
space
are
thus
preserved
we
shall
then
be
present
in
imagination
at
the
phenomenon
we
wish
to
foretell
we
shall
know
exactly
at
what
point
in
space
and
after
how
many
units
of
time
this
phenomenon
takes
place
if
we
then
restore
to
these
units
their
psychical
nature
we
shall
thrust
the
event
again
into
the
future
and
say
that
we
have
foreseen
it
when
in
reality
we
have
seen
it
sidenote
in
dealing
with
states
of
consciousness
we
can
not
vary
their
duration
without
altering
their
nature
but
these
units
of
time
which
make
up
living
duration
and
which
the
astronomer
can
dispose
of
as
he
pleases
because
they
give
no
handle
to
science
are
just
what
concern
the
psychologist
for
psychology
deals
with
the
intervals
themselves
and
not
with
their
extremities
certainly
pure
consciousness
does
not
perceive
time
as
a
sum
of
units
of
duration
left
to
itself
it
has
no
means
and
even
no
reason
to
measure
time
but
a
feeling
which
lasted
only
half
the
number
of
days
for
example
would
no
longer
be
the
same
feeling
for
it
it
would
lack
thousands
of
impressions
which
gradually
thickened
its
substance
and
altered
its
colour
true
when
we
give
this
feeling
a
certain
name
when
we
treat
it
as
a
thing
we
believe
that
we
can
diminish
its
duration
by
half
for
example
and
also
halve
the
duration
of
all
the
rest
of
our
history
it
seems
that
it
would
still
be
the
same
life
only
on
a
reduced
scale
but
we
forget
that
states
of
consciousness
are
processes
and
not
things
that
if
we
denote
them
each
by
a
single
word
it
is
for
the
convenience
of
language
that
they
are
alive
and
therefore
constantly
changing
that
in
consequence
it
is
impossible
to
cut
off
a
moment
from
them
without
making
them
poorer
by
the
loss
of
some
impression
and
thus
altering
their
quality
i
quite
understand
that
the
orbit
of
a
planet
might
be
perceived
all
at
once
or
in
a
very
short
time
because
its
successive
positions
or
the
of
its
movement
are
the
only
things
that
matter
and
not
the
duration
of
the
equal
intervals
which
separate
them
but
when
we
have
to
do
with
a
feeling
it
has
no
precise
result
except
its
having
been
felt
and
to
estimate
this
result
adequately
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
gone
through
all
the
phases
of
the
feeling
itself
and
to
have
taken
up
the
same
duration
even
if
this
feeling
has
finally
issued
in
some
definite
action
which
might
be
compared
to
the
definite
position
of
a
planet
in
space
the
knowledge
of
this
act
will
hardly
enable
us
to
estimate
the
influence
of
the
feeling
on
the
whole
of
a
and
it
is
this
very
influence
which
we
want
to
know
all
foreseeing
is
in
reality
seeing
and
this
seeing
takes
place
when
we
can
reduce
as
much
as
we
please
an
interval
of
future
time
while
preserving
the
relation
of
its
parts
to
one
another
as
happens
in
the
case
of
astronomical
predictions
but
what
does
reducing
an
interval
of
time
mean
except
emptying
or
impoverishing
the
conscious
states
which
fill
it
and
does
not
the
very
possibility
of
seeing
an
astronomical
period
in
miniature
thus
imply
the
impossibility
of
modifying
a
psychological
series
in
the
same
way
since
it
is
only
by
taking
this
psychological
series
as
an
invariable
basis
that
we
shall
be
able
to
make
an
astronomical
period
vary
arbitrarily
as
regards
the
unit
of
duration
sidenote
difference
between
past
and
future
duration
in
this
respect
thus
when
we
ask
whether
a
future
action
could
have
been
foreseen
we
unwittingly
identify
that
time
with
which
we
have
to
do
in
the
exact
sciences
and
which
is
reducible
to
a
number
with
real
duration
whose
quantity
is
really
a
quality
and
which
we
can
not
curtail
by
an
instant
without
altering
the
nature
of
the
facts
which
fill
it
no
doubt
the
identification
is
made
easier
by
the
fact
that
in
a
large
number
of
cases
we
are
justified
in
dealing
with
real
duration
as
with
astronomical
time
thus
when
we
call
to
mind
the
past
a
series
of
deeds
done
we
always
shorten
it
without
however
distorting
the
nature
of
the
event
which
interests
us
the
reason
is
that
we
know
it
already
for
the
psychic
state
when
it
reaches
the
end
of
the
which
constitutes
its
very
existence
becomes
a
which
one
can
picture
to
oneself
all
at
once
here
we
find
ourselves
in
the
same
position
as
the
astronomer
when
he
takes
in
at
a
glance
the
orbit
which
a
planet
will
need
several
years
to
traverse
in
fact
astronomical
prediction
should
be
compared
with
the
recollection
of
the
past
state
of
consciousness
not
with
the
anticipation
of
the
future
one
but
when
we
have
to
determine
a
future
state
of
consciousness
however
superficial
it
may
be
we
can
no
longer
view
the
antecedents
in
a
static
condition
as
things
we
must
view
them
in
a
dynamic
condition
as
processes
since
we
are
concerned
with
their
influence
alone
now
their
duration
is
this
very
influence
therefore
it
will
no
longer
do
to
shorten
future
duration
in
order
to
picture
its
parts
beforehand
one
is
bound
to
this
duration
whilst
it
is
unfolding
as
far
as
psychic
states
are
concerned
there
is
no
perceptible
difference
between
foreseeing
seeing
and
acting
sidenote
the
determinist
argument
that
psychic
phenomena
are
subject
to
the
law
same
antecedents
same
consequent
only
one
course
will
remain
open
to
the
determinist
he
will
probably
give
up
asserting
the
possibility
of
foreseeing
a
certain
future
act
or
state
of
consciousness
but
will
maintain
that
every
act
is
determined
by
its
psychic
antecedents
or
in
other
words
that
the
facts
of
consciousness
went
the
phenomena
of
nature
are
subject
to
laws
this
way
of
arguing
means
at
bottom
that
he
will
leave
out
the
particular
features
of
the
concrete
psychic
states
lest
he
find
himself
confronted
by
phenomena
which
defy
all
symbolical
representation
and
therefore
all
anticipation
the
particular
nature
of
these
phenomena
is
thus
thrust
out
of
sight
but
it
is
asserted
that
being
phenomena
they
must
remain
subject
to
the
law
of
causality
now
it
is
argued
this
law
means
that
every
phenomenon
is
determined
by
its
conditions
or
in
other
words
that
the
same
causes
produce
the
same
effects
either
then
the
act
is
inseparably
bound
to
its
antecedents
or
the
principle
of
causality
admits
of
an
incomprehensible
exception
sidenote
but
as
regards
inner
states
the
same
antecedents
will
never
recur
this
last
form
of
the
determinist
argument
differs
less
than
might
be
thought
from
all
the
others
which
have
been
examined
above
to
say
that
the
same
inner
causes
will
reproduce
the
same
effects
is
to
assume
that
the
same
cause
can
appear
a
second
time
on
the
stage
of
consciousness
now
if
duration
is
what
we
say
psychic
states
are
radically
heterogeneous
to
each
other
and
it
is
impossible
that
any
two
of
them
should
be
quite
alike
since
they
are
two
different
moments
of
a
while
the
external
object
does
not
bear
the
mark
of
the
time
that
has
elapsed
and
thus
in
spite
of
the
difference
of
time
the
physicist
can
again
encounter
identical
elementary
conditions
duration
is
something
real
for
the
consciousness
which
preserves
the
trace
of
it
and
we
can
not
here
speak
of
identical
conditions
because
the
same
moment
does
not
occur
twice
it
is
no
use
arguing
that
even
if
there
are
no
two
psychic
states
which
are
altogether
alike
yet
analysis
would
resolve
these
different
states
into
more
general
and
homogeneous
elements
which
might
be
compared
with
each
other
this
would
be
to
forget
that
even
the
simplest
psychic
elements
possess
a
personality
and
a
life
of
their
own
however
superficial
they
may
be
they
are
in
a
constant
state
of
becoming
and
the
same
feeling
by
the
mere
fact
of
being
repeated
is
a
new
feeling
indeed
we
have
no
reason
for
calling
it
by
its
former
name
save
that
it
corresponds
to
the
same
external
cause
or
projects
itself
outwardly
into
similar
attitudes
hence
it
would
simply
be
begging
the
question
to
deduce
from
the
likeness
of
two
conscious
states
that
the
same
cause
produces
the
same
effect
in
short
if
the
causal
relation
still
holds
good
in
the
realm
of
inner
states
it
can
not
resemble
in
any
way
what
we
call
causality
in
nature
for
the
physicist
the
same
cause
always
produces
the
same
effect
for
a
psychologist
who
does
not
let
himself
be
misled
by
merely
apparent
analogies
a
inner
cause
produces
its
effect
once
for
all
and
will
never
reproduce
it
and
if
it
is
now
asserted
that
this
effect
was
inseparably
bound
up
with
this
particular
cause
such
an
assertion
will
mean
one
of
two
things
either
that
the
antecedents
being
given
the
future
action
might
have
been
foreseen
or
that
the
action
having
once
been
performed
any
other
actionals
seen
under
the
given
conditions
to
have
been
impossible
now
we
saw
that
both
these
assertions
were
equally
meaningless
and
that
they
also
involved
a
false
conception
of
duration
sidenote
analysis
of
the
conception
of
cause
which
underlies
the
whole
determinist
argument
nevertheless
it
will
be
worth
while
to
dwell
on
this
latter
form
of
the
determinist
argument
even
though
it
be
only
to
explain
from
our
point
of
view
the
meaning
of
the
two
words
determination
and
causality
in
vain
do
we
argue
that
there
can
not
be
any
question
either
of
foreseeing
a
future
action
in
the
way
that
an
astronomical
phenomenon
is
foreseen
or
of
asserting
when
once
an
action
is
done
that
any
other
action
would
have
been
impossible
under
the
given
conditions
in
vain
do
we
add
that
even
when
it
takes
this
form
the
same
causes
produce
the
same
effects
the
principle
of
universal
determination
loses
every
shred
of
meaning
in
the
inner
world
of
conscious
states
the
determinist
will
perhaps
yield
to
our
arguments
on
each
of
these
three
points
in
particular
will
admit
that
in
the
psychical
field
one
can
not
ascribe
any
of
these
three
meanings
to
the
word
determination
will
probably
fail
to
discover
a
fourth
meaning
and
yet
will
go
on
repeating
that
the
act
is
inseparably
bound
up
with
its
antecedents
we
thus
find
ourselves
here
confronted
by
so
a
misapprehension
and
so
obstinate
a
prejudice
that
we
can
not
get
the
better
of
them
without
attacking
them
at
their
root
which
is
the
principle
of
causality
by
analysing
the
concept
of
cause
we
shall
show
the
ambiguity
which
it
involves
and
though
not
aiming
at
a
formal
definition
of
freedom
we
shall
perhaps
get
beyond
the
purely
negative
idea
of
it
which
we
have
framed
up
to
the
present
sidenote
causality
as
regular
succession
does
not
apply
to
conscious
states
and
can
not
disprove
free
will
we
perceive
physical
phenomena
and
these
phenomena
obey
laws
this
means
i
that
phenomena
b
c
d
previously
perceived
can
occur
again
in
the
same
shape
that
a
certain
phenomenon
which
appeared
after
the
conditions
b
c
d
and
after
these
conditions
only
will
not
fail
to
recur
as
soon
as
the
same
conditions
are
again
present
if
the
principle
of
causality
told
us
nothing
more
as
the
empiricists
claim
we
should
willingly
grant
these
philosophers
that
their
principle
is
derived
from
experience
but
it
would
no
longer
prove
anything
against
our
freedom
for
it
would
then
be
understood
that
definite
antecedents
give
rise
to
a
definite
consequent
experience
shows
us
this
regular
succession
but
the
question
is
whether
this
regularity
is
found
in
the
domain
of
consciousness
too
and
that
is
the
whole
problem
of
free
will
we
grant
you
for
a
moment
that
the
principle
of
causality
is
nothing
but
the
summing
up
of
the
uniform
and
unconditional
successions
observed
in
the
past
by
what
right
then
do
you
apply
it
to
those
states
of
consciousness
in
which
no
regular
succession
has
yet
been
discovered
since
the
attempt
to
foresee
them
ever
fails
and
how
can
you
base
on
this
principle
your
argument
to
prove
the
determinism
of
inner
states
when
according
to
you
the
determinism
of
observed
facts
is
the
sole
source
of
the
principle
itself
in
truth
when
the
empiricists
make
use
of
the
principle
of
causality
to
disprove
human
freedom
they
take
the
word
cause
in
a
new
meaning
which
is
the
very
meaning
given
to
it
by
common
sense
to
assert
the
regular
succession
of
two
phenomena
is
indeed
to
recognize
that
the
first
being
given
we
already
catch
sight
of
the
second
but
this
wholly
subjective
connexion
between
two
ideas
is
not
enough
for
common
sense
it
seems
to
common
sense
that
if
the
idea
of
the
second
phenomenon
is
already
implied
in
that
of
the
first
the
second
phenomenon
itself
must
exist
objectively
in
some
way
or
other
within
the
first
phenomenon
and
common
sense
was
bound
to
come
to
this
conclusion
because
to
distinguish
exactly
between
an
objective
connexion
of
phenomena
and
a
subjective
association
between
their
ideas
presupposes
a
fairly
high
degree
of
philosophical
culture
we
thus
pass
imperceptibly
from
the
first
meaning
to
the
second
and
we
picture
the
causal
relation
as
a
kind
of
prefiguring
of
the
future
phenomenon
in
its
present
conditions
now
this
prefiguring
can
be
understood
in
two
very
different
ways
and
it
is
just
here
that
the
ambiguity
begins
sidenote
causality
as
the
prefiguring
of
the
future
phenomenon
in
its
present
conditions
in
one
form
destroys
concrete
phenomena
in
the
first
place
mathematics
furnishes
us
with
type
of
this
kind
of
prefiguring
the
very
movement
by
which
we
draw
the
circumference
of
a
circle
on
a
sheet
of
paper
generates
all
the
mathematical
properties
of
this
figure
in
this
sense
an
unlimited
number
of
theorems
can
be
said
to
within
the
definition
although
they
will
be
spread
out
in
duration
for
the
mathematician
who
deduces
them
it
is
true
that
we
are
here
in
the
realm
of
pure
quantity
and
that
as
geometrical
properties
can
be
expressed
in
the
form
of
equations
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
the
original
equation
expressing
the
fundamental
property
of
the
figure
is
transformed
into
an
unlimited
number
of
new
ones
all
virtually
contained
in
the
first
on
the
contrary
physical
phenomena
which
succeed
one
another
and
are
perceived
by
our
senses
are
distinguished
by
quality
not
less
than
by
quantity
so
that
there
would
be
some
difficulty
in
at
once
declaring
them
equivalent
to
one
another
but
just
because
they
are
perceived
through
our
we
seem
justified
in
ascribing
their
qualitative
differences
to
the
impression
which
they
make
on
us
and
in
assuming
behind
the
heterogeneity
of
our
sensations
a
homogeneous
physical
universe
thus
we
shall
strip
matter
of
the
concrete
qualities
with
which
our
senses
clothe
it
colour
heat
resistance
even
weight
and
we
shall
finally
find
ourselves
confronted
with
homogeneous
extensity
space
without
body
the
only
step
then
remaining
will
be
to
describe
figures
in
space
to
make
them
move
according
to
mathematically
formulated
laws
and
to
explain
the
apparent
qualities
of
matter
by
the
shape
position
and
motion
of
these
geometrical
figures
now
position
is
given
by
a
system
of
fixed
magnitudes
and
motion
is
expressed
by
a
law
by
a
constant
relation
between
variable
magnitudes
but
shape
is
a
mental
image
and
however
tenuous
however
transparent
we
assume
it
to
be
it
still
constitutes
in
so
far
as
our
imagination
has
so
to
speak
the
visual
perception
of
it
a
concrete
and
therefore
irreducible
quality
of
matter
it
will
therefore
be
necessary
to
make
a
clean
sweep
of
this
image
itself
and
replace
it
by
the
abstract
formula
of
the
movement
which
gives
rise
to
the
figure
picture
then
algebraical
relations
getting
entangled
in
one
another
becoming
objective
by
this
very
entanglement
and
producing
by
the
mere
effect
of
their
complexity
concrete
visible
and
tangible
reality
you
will
be
merely
drawing
the
consequences
of
the
principle
of
causality
understood
in
the
sense
of
an
actual
prefiguring
of
the
future
in
the
present
the
scientists
of
our
time
do
not
seem
indeed
to
have
carried
abstraction
so
far
except
perhaps
lord
kelvin
this
acute
and
profound
physicist
assumed
that
space
is
filled
with
a
homogeneous
and
incompressible
fluid
in
which
vortices
move
thus
producing
the
properties
of
matter
these
vortices
are
the
constituent
elements
of
bodies
the
atom
thus
becomes
a
movement
and
physical
phenomena
are
reduced
to
regular
movements
taking
place
within
an
incompressible
fluid
but
if
you
will
notice
that
this
fluid
is
perfectly
homogeneous
that
between
its
parts
there
is
neither
an
empty
interval
which
separates
them
nor
any
difference
whatever
by
which
they
can
be
distinguished
you
will
see
that
all
movement
taking
place
within
this
fluid
is
really
equivalent
to
absolute
immobility
since
before
during
and
after
the
movement
nothing
changes
and
nothing
has
changed
in
the
whole
the
movement
which
is
here
spoken
of
is
thus
not
a
movement
which
actually
takes
place
but
only
a
movement
which
is
pictured
mentally
it
is
a
relation
between
relations
it
is
implicitly
supposed
though
perhaps
not
actually
realized
that
motion
has
something
to
do
with
consciousness
that
in
space
there
are
only
simultaneities
and
that
the
business
of
the
physicist
is
to
provide
us
with
the
means
of
calculating
these
relations
of
simultaneity
for
any
moment
of
our
duration
nowhere
has
mechanism
been
carried
further
than
in
this
system
since
the
very
shape
of
the
ultimate
elements
of
matter
is
here
reduced
to
a
movement
but
the
cartesian
physics
already
anticipated
this
interpretation
for
if
matter
is
nothing
as
descartes
claimed
but
homogeneous
extensity
the
movements
of
the
parts
of
this
extensity
can
be
conceived
through
the
abstract
law
which
governs
them
or
through
an
algebraical
equation
between
variable
magnitudes
but
can
not
be
represented
under
the
concrete
form
of
an
image
and
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
prove
that
the
more
the
progress
of
mechanical
explanations
enables
us
to
develop
this
conception
of
causality
and
therefore
to
relieve
the
atom
of
the
weight
of
its
sensible
qualities
the
more
the
concrete
existence
of
the
phenomena
of
nature
tends
to
vanish
into
algebraical
smoke
sidenote
it
thus
leads
to
descartes
physics
and
metaphysics
but
can
not
bind
future
to
present
without
neglecting
duration
thus
understood
the
relation
of
causality
is
a
necessary
relation
in
the
sense
that
it
will
indefinitely
approach
the
relation
of
identity
as
a
curve
approaches
its
asymptote
the
principle
of
identity
is
the
absolute
law
of
our
consciousness
it
asserts
that
what
is
thought
is
thought
at
the
moment
when
we
think
it
and
what
gives
this
principle
its
absolute
necessity
is
that
it
does
not
bind
the
future
to
the
present
but
only
the
present
to
the
present
it
expresses
the
unshakable
confidence
that
consciousness
feels
in
itself
so
long
as
faithful
to
its
duty
it
confines
itself
to
declaring
the
apparent
present
state
of
the
mind
but
the
principle
of
causality
in
so
far
as
it
is
supposed
to
bind
the
future
to
the
present
could
never
take
the
form
of
a
necessary
principle
for
the
successive
moments
of
real
time
are
not
bound
up
with
one
another
and
no
effort
of
logic
will
succeed
in
proving
that
what
has
been
will
be
or
will
continue
to
be
that
the
same
antecedents
will
always
give
rise
to
identical
consequents
descartes
understood
this
so
well
that
he
attributed
the
regularity
of
the
physical
world
and
the
continuation
of
the
same
effects
to
the
constantly
renewed
grace
of
providence
he
built
up
as
it
were
an
instantaneous
physics
intended
for
a
universe
the
whole
duration
of
which
might
as
well
be
confined
to
the
present
moment
and
spinoza
maintained
that
the
indefinite
series
of
phenomena
which
takes
for
us
the
form
of
a
succession
in
time
was
equivalent
in
the
absolute
to
the
divine
unity
he
thus
assumed
on
the
one
hand
that
the
relation
of
apparent
causality
between
phenomena
melted
away
into
a
relation
of
identity
in
the
absolute
and
on
the
other
that
the
indefinite
duration
of
things
was
all
contained
in
a
single
moment
which
is
eternity
in
short
whether
we
study
cartesian
physics
spinozistic
metaphysics
or
the
scientific
theories
of
our
own
time
we
shall
find
everywhere
the
same
anxiety
to
establish
a
relation
of
logical
necessity
between
cause
and
effect
and
we
shall
see
that
this
anxiety
shows
itself
in
a
tendency
to
transform
relations
of
succession
into
relations
of
inherence
to
do
away
with
active
duration
and
to
substitute
for
apparent
causality
a
fundamental
identity
sidenote
the
necessary
determination
of
phenomena
implies
but
we
and
are
therefore
free
now
if
the
development
of
the
notion
of
causality
understood
in
the
sense
of
necessary
connexion
leads
to
the
spinozistic
or
cartesian
conception
of
nature
inversely
all
relation
of
necessary
determination
established
between
successive
phenomena
may
be
supposed
to
arise
from
our
perceiving
in
a
confused
form
some
mathematical
mechanism
behind
their
heterogeneity
we
do
not
claim
that
common
sense
has
any
intuition
of
the
kinetic
theories
of
matter
still
less
perhaps
of
a
spinozistic
mechanism
but
it
will
be
seen
that
the
more
the
effect
seems
necessarily
bound
up
with
the
cause
the
more
we
tend
to
put
it
in
the
cause
itself
as
a
mathematical
consequence
in
its
principle
and
thus
to
cancel
the
effect
of
duration
that
under
the
influence
of
the
same
external
conditions
i
do
not
behave
as
i
behaved
yesterday
is
not
at
all
surprising
because
i
because
i
but
things
considered
apart
from
our
perception
do
not
seem
to
endure
and
the
more
thoroughly
we
examine
this
idea
the
more
absurd
it
seems
to
us
to
suppose
that
the
same
cause
should
not
produce
the
effect
which
it
produced
yesterday
we
certainly
feel
it
is
true
that
although
things
do
not
endure
as
we
do
ourselves
nevertheless
there
must
be
some
reason
why
phenomena
are
seen
to
one
another
instead
of
being
set
out
all
at
once
and
this
is
why
the
notion
of
causality
although
it
gets
indefinitely
near
that
of
identity
will
never
seem
to
us
to
coincide
with
it
unless
we
conceive
clearly
the
idea
of
a
mathematical
mechanism
or
unless
some
subtle
metaphysics
removes
our
very
legitimate
scruples
on
the
point
it
is
no
less
obvious
that
our
belief
in
the
necessary
determination
of
phenomena
by
one
another
becomes
stronger
in
proportion
as
we
are
more
inclined
to
regard
duration
as
a
subjective
form
of
our
consciousness
in
other
words
the
more
we
tend
to
set
up
the
causal
relation
as
a
relation
of
necessary
determination
the
more
we
assert
thereby
that
things
do
not
like
ourselves
this
amounts
to
saying
that
the
more
we
strengthen
the
principle
of
causality
the
more
we
emphasize
the
difference
between
a
physical
series
and
a
psychical
one
whence
finally
it
would
result
however
paradoxical
the
opinion
may
seem
that
the
assumption
of
a
relation
of
mathematical
inherence
between
external
phenomena
ought
to
bring
with
it
as
a
natural
or
at
least
as
a
plausible
consequence
the
belief
in
human
free
will
but
this
last
consequence
will
not
concern
us
for
the
moment
we
are
merely
trying
here
to
trace
out
the
first
meaning
of
the
word
causality
and
we
think
we
have
shown
that
the
prefiguring
of
the
future
in
the
present
is
easily
conceived
under
a
mathematical
form
thanks
to
a
certain
conception
of
duration
which
without
seeming
to
be
so
is
fairly
familiar
to
common
sense
sidenote
prefiguring
as
having
an
idea
of
a
future
act
which
we
can
not
realize
without
effort
does
not
involve
necessary
determination
but
there
is
a
prefiguring
of
another
kind
still
more
familiar
to
our
mind
because
immediate
prefiguring
as
consciousness
gives
us
the
type
of
it
we
go
in
fact
through
successive
states
of
consciousness
and
although
the
later
was
not
contained
in
the
earlier
we
had
before
us
at
the
time
a
more
or
less
confused
idea
of
it
the
actual
realization
of
this
idea
however
did
not
appear
as
certain
but
merely
as
possible
yet
between
the
idea
and
the
action
some
hardly
perceptible
intermediate
processes
come
in
the
whole
mass
of
which
takes
for
us
a
form
generis
which
is
called
the
feeling
of
effort
and
from
the
idea
to
the
effort
from
the
effort
to
the
act
the
progress
has
been
so
continuous
that
we
can
not
say
where
the
idea
and
the
effort
end
and
where
the
act
begins
hence
we
see
that
in
a
certain
sense
we
may
still
say
here
that
the
future
was
prefigured
in
the
present
but
it
must
be
added
that
this
prefiguring
is
very
imperfect
since
the
future
action
of
which
we
have
the
present
idea
is
conceived
as
realizable
but
not
as
realized
and
since
even
when
we
plan
the
effort
necessary
to
accomplish
it
we
feel
that
there
is
still
time
to
stop
if
then
we
decide
to
picture
the
causal
relation
in
this
second
form
we
can
assert
that
there
will
no
longer
be
a
relation
of
necessary
determination
between
the
cause
and
the
effect
for
the
effect
will
no
longer
be
given
in
the
cause
it
will
be
there
only
in
the
state
of
pure
possibility
and
as
a
vague
idea
which
perhaps
will
not
be
followed
by
the
corresponding
action
but
we
shall
not
be
surprised
that
this
approximation
is
enough
for
common
sense
if
we
think
of
the
readiness
with
which
children
and
primitive
people
accept
the
idea
of
a
whimsical
nature
in
which
caprice
plays
a
part
no
less
important
than
necessity
nay
this
way
of
conceiving
causality
will
be
more
easily
understood
by
the
general
run
of
people
since
it
does
not
demand
any
effort
of
abstraction
and
only
implies
a
certain
analogy
between
the
outer
and
the
inner
world
between
the
succession
of
objective
phenomena
and
that
of
our
subjective
states
sidenote
this
second
conception
of
causality
leads
to
leibniz
as
the
first
led
to
spinoza
in
truth
this
second
way
of
conceiving
the
relation
of
cause
to
effect
is
more
natural
than
the
first
in
that
it
immediately
satisfies
the
need
of
a
mental
image
if
we
look
for
the
phenomenon
b
within
the
phenomenon
a
which
regularly
precedes
it
the
reason
is
that
the
habit
of
associating
the
two
images
ends
in
giving
us
the
idea
of
the
second
phenomenon
wrapped
up
as
it
were
in
that
of
the
first
it
is
natural
then
that
we
should
push
this
objectification
to
its
furthest
limit
and
that
we
should
make
the
phenomenon
a
itself
into
a
psychic
state
in
which
the
phenomenon
b
is
supposed
to
be
contained
as
a
very
vague
idea
we
simply
suppose
thereby
that
the
objective
connexion
of
the
two
phenomena
resembles
the
subjective
association
which
suggested
the
idea
of
it
to
us
the
qualities
of
things
are
thus
set
up
as
actual
somewhat
analogous
to
those
of
our
own
self
the
material
universe
is
credited
with
a
vague
personality
which
is
diffused
through
space
and
which
although
not
exactly
endowed
with
a
conscious
will
is
led
on
from
one
state
to
another
by
an
inner
impulse
a
kind
of
effort
such
was
ancient
hylozoism
a
and
even
contradictory
hypothesis
which
left
matter
its
extensity
although
attributing
to
it
real
conscious
states
and
which
spread
the
qualities
of
matter
throughout
extensity
while
treating
these
qualities
as
inner
simple
states
it
was
reserved
for
leibniz
to
do
away
with
this
contradiction
and
to
show
that
if
the
succession
of
external
qualities
or
phenomena
is
understood
as
the
succession
of
our
own
ideas
these
qualities
must
be
regarded
as
simple
states
or
perceptions
and
the
matter
which
supports
them
as
an
unextended
monad
analogous
to
our
soul
but
if
such
be
the
case
the
successive
states
of
matter
can
not
be
perceived
from
the
outside
any
more
than
our
own
psychic
states
the
hypothesis
of
harmony
must
be
introduced
in
order
to
explain
how
these
inner
states
are
representative
of
one
another
thus
with
our
second
conception
of
the
relation
of
causality
we
reach
leibniz
as
with
the
first
we
reached
spinoza
and
in
both
cases
we
merely
push
to
their
extreme
limit
or
formulate
with
greater
precision
two
and
confused
ideas
of
common
sense
sidenote
it
does
not
involve
necessary
determination
now
it
is
obvious
that
the
relation
of
causality
understood
in
this
second
way
does
not
involve
the
necessary
determination
of
the
effect
by
the
cause
history
indeed
proves
it
we
see
ancient
hylozoism
the
first
outcome
of
this
conception
of
causality
explained
the
regular
succession
of
causes
and
effects
by
a
real
ex
sometimes
it
was
a
necessity
external
to
things
and
hovering
over
them
sometimes
an
inner
reason
acting
by
rules
somewhat
similar
to
those
which
govern
our
own
conduct
nor
do
the
perceptions
of
leibniz
monad
necessitate
one
another
god
has
to
regulate
their
order
in
advance
in
fact
leibniz
determinism
does
not
spring
from
his
conception
of
the
monad
but
from
the
fact
that
he
builds
up
the
universe
with
monads
only
having
denied
all
mechanical
influence
of
substances
on
one
another
he
had
to
explain
how
it
happens
that
their
states
correspond
hence
a
determinism
which
arises
from
the
necessity
of
positing
a
harmony
and
not
at
all
from
the
dynamic
conception
of
the
relation
of
causality
but
let
us
leave
history
aside
consciousness
itself
testifies
that
the
abstract
idea
of
force
is
that
of
indeterminate
effort
that
of
an
effort
which
has
not
yet
issued
in
an
act
and
in
which
the
act
is
still
only
at
the
stage
of
an
idea
in
other
words
the
dynamic
conception
of
the
causal
relation
ascribes
to
things
a
duration
absolutely
like
our
own
whatever
may
be
the
nature
of
this
duration
to
picture
in
this
way
the
relation
of
cause
to
effect
is
to
assume
that
the
future
is
not
more
closely
bound
up
with
the
present
in
the
external
world
than
it
is
in
our
own
inner
life
sidenote
each
of
these
contradictory
interpretations
of
causality
and
duration
by
itself
safeguards
freedom
taken
together
they
destroy
it
it
follows
from
this
twofold
analysis
that
the
principle
of
causality
involves
two
contradictory
conceptions
of
duration
two
mutually
exclusive
ways
of
prefiguring
the
future
in
the
present
sometimes
all
phenomena
physical
or
psychical
are
pictured
as
in
the
same
way
and
therefore
in
the
way
that
do
in
this
case
the
future
will
exist
in
the
present
only
as
an
idea
and
the
passing
from
the
present
to
the
future
will
take
the
form
of
an
effort
which
does
not
always
lead
to
the
realization
of
the
idea
conceived
sometimes
on
the
other
hand
duration
is
regarded
as
the
characteristic
form
of
conscious
states
in
this
case
things
are
no
longer
supposed
to
as
we
do
and
a
mathematical
of
their
future
in
their
present
is
admitted
now
each
of
these
two
hypotheses
when
taken
by
itself
safeguards
human
freedom
for
the
first
would
lead
to
the
result
that
even
the
phenomena
of
nature
were
contingent
and
the
second
by
attributing
the
necessary
determination
of
physical
phenomena
to
the
fact
that
things
do
not
as
we
do
invites
us
to
regard
the
self
which
is
subject
to
duration
as
a
free
force
therefore
every
clear
conception
of
causality
where
we
know
our
own
meaning
leads
to
the
idea
of
human
freedom
as
a
natural
consequence
unfortunately
the
habit
has
grown
up
of
taking
the
principle
of
causality
in
both
senses
at
the
same
time
because
the
one
is
more
flattering
to
our
imagination
and
the
other
is
more
favourable
to
mathematical
reasoning
sometimes
we
think
particularly
of
the
regular
of
physical
phenomena
and
of
the
kind
of
inner
effort
by
which
one
another
sometimes
we
fix
our
mind
on
the
absolute
of
these
phenomena
and
from
the
idea
of
regularity
we
pass
by
imperceptible
steps
to
that
of
mathematical
necessity
which
excludes
duration
understood
in
the
first
way
and
we
do
not
see
any
harm
in
letting
these
two
conceptions
blend
into
one
another
and
in
assigning
greater
importance
to
the
one
or
the
other
according
as
we
are
more
or
less
concerned
with
the
interests
of
science
but
to
apply
the
principle
of
causality
in
this
ambiguous
form
to
the
succession
of
conscious
states
is
uselessly
and
wantonly
to
run
into
inextricable
difficulties
the
idea
of
force
which
really
excludes
that
of
necessary
determination
has
got
into
the
habit
so
to
speak
of
amalgamating
with
that
of
necessity
in
consequence
of
the
very
use
which
we
make
of
the
principle
of
causality
in
nature
on
the
one
hand
we
know
force
only
through
the
witness
of
consciousness
and
consciousness
does
not
assert
does
not
even
understand
the
absolute
determination
now
of
actions
that
are
still
to
come
that
is
all
that
experience
teaches
us
and
if
we
hold
by
experience
we
should
say
that
we
feel
ourselves
free
that
we
perceive
force
rightly
or
wrongly
as
a
free
spontaneity
but
on
the
other
hand
this
idea
of
force
carried
over
into
nature
travelling
there
side
by
side
with
the
idea
of
necessity
has
got
corrupted
before
it
returns
from
the
journey
it
returns
impregnated
with
the
idea
of
necessity
and
in
the
light
of
the
rôle
which
we
have
made
it
play
in
the
external
world
we
regard
force
as
determining
with
strict
necessity
the
effects
which
flow
from
it
here
again
the
mistake
made
by
consciousness
arises
from
the
fact
that
it
looks
at
the
self
not
directly
but
by
a
kind
of
refraction
through
the
forms
which
it
has
lent
to
external
perception
and
which
the
latter
does
not
give
back
without
having
left
its
mark
on
them
a
compromise
as
it
were
has
been
brought
about
between
the
idea
of
force
and
that
of
necessary
determination
the
wholly
mechanical
determination
of
two
external
phenomena
by
one
another
now
assumes
in
our
eyes
the
same
form
as
the
dynamic
relation
of
our
exertion
of
force
to
the
act
which
springs
from
it
but
in
return
this
latter
relation
takes
the
form
of
a
mathematical
derivation
the
human
action
being
supposed
to
issue
mechanically
and
therefore
necessarily
from
the
force
which
produces
it
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
mingling
of
two
different
and
almost
opposite
ideas
offers
advantages
to
common
sense
since
it
enables
us
to
picture
in
the
same
way
and
denote
by
one
and
the
same
word
both
the
relation
which
exists
between
two
moments
of
our
life
and
that
which
binds
together
the
successive
moments
of
the
external
world
we
have
seen
that
though
our
deepest
conscious
states
exclude
numerical
multiplicity
yet
we
break
them
up
into
parts
external
to
one
another
that
though
the
elements
of
concrete
duration
permeate
one
another
duration
expressing
itself
in
extensity
exhibits
moments
as
distinct
as
the
bodies
scattered
in
space
is
it
surprising
then
that
between
the
moments
of
our
life
when
it
has
been
so
to
speak
objectified
we
set
up
a
relation
analogous
to
the
objective
relation
of
causality
and
that
an
exchange
which
again
may
be
compared
to
the
phenomenon
of
endosmosis
takes
place
between
the
dynamic
idea
of
free
effort
and
the
mathematical
concept
of
necessary
determination
sidenote
though
united
in
popular
thought
the
ideas
of
free
effort
and
necessary
determination
are
kept
apart
by
physical
science
but
the
sundering
of
these
two
ideas
is
an
accomplished
fact
in
the
natural
sciences
the
physicist
may
speak
of
and
even
picture
their
mode
of
action
by
analogy
with
an
inner
effort
but
he
will
never
introduce
this
hypothesis
into
a
scientific
explanation
even
those
who
with
faraday
replace
the
extended
atoms
by
dynamic
points
will
treat
the
centres
of
force
and
the
lines
of
force
mathematically
without
troubling
about
force
itself
considered
as
an
activity
or
an
effort
it
thus
comes
to
be
understood
that
the
relation
of
external
causality
is
purely
mathematical
and
has
no
resemblance
to
the
relation
between
psychical
force
and
the
act
which
springs
from
it
sidenote
they
should
be
kept
apart
too
by
psychology
it
is
now
time
to
add
that
the
relation
of
inner
causality
is
purely
dynamic
and
has
no
analogy
with
the
relation
of
two
external
phenomena
which
condition
one
another
for
as
the
latter
are
capable
of
recurring
in
a
homogeneous
space
their
relation
can
be
expressed
in
terms
of
a
law
whereas
psychic
states
occur
once
in
consciousness
and
will
never
occur
again
a
careful
analysis
of
the
psychological
phenomenon
led
us
to
this
conclusion
in
the
beginning
the
study
of
the
notions
of
causality
and
duration
viewed
in
themselves
has
merely
confirmed
it
sidenote
freedom
real
but
indefineable
we
can
now
formulate
our
conception
of
freedom
freedom
is
the
relation
of
the
concrete
self
to
the
act
which
it
performs
this
relation
is
indefinable
just
because
we
free
for
we
can
analyse
a
thing
but
not
a
process
we
can
break
up
extensity
but
not
duration
or
if
we
persist
in
analysing
it
we
unconsciously
transform
the
process
into
a
thing
and
duration
into
extensity
by
the
very
fact
of
breaking
up
concrete
time
we
set
out
its
moments
in
homogeneous
space
in
place
of
the
doing
we
put
the
already
done
and
as
we
have
begun
by
so
to
speak
stereotyping
the
activity
of
the
self
we
see
spontaneity
settle
down
into
inertia
and
freedom
into
necessity
thus
any
positive
definition
of
freedom
will
ensure
the
victory
of
determinism
shall
we
define
the
free
act
by
saying
of
this
act
when
it
is
once
done
that
it
might
have
been
left
undone
but
this
assertion
as
also
its
opposite
implies
the
idea
of
an
absolute
equivalence
between
concrete
duration
and
its
spatial
symbol
and
as
soon
as
we
admit
this
equivalence
we
are
led
on
by
the
very
development
of
the
formula
which
we
have
just
set
forth
to
the
most
rigid
determinism
shall
we
define
the
free
act
as
that
which
could
not
be
foreseen
even
when
all
the
conditions
were
known
in
advance
but
to
conceive
all
the
conditions
as
given
is
when
dealing
with
concrete
duration
to
place
oneself
at
the
very
moment
at
which
the
act
is
being
performed
or
else
it
is
admitted
that
the
matter
of
psychic
duration
can
be
pictured
symbolically
in
advance
which
amounts
as
we
said
to
treating
time
as
a
homogeneous
medium
and
to
reasserting
in
new
words
the
absolute
equivalence
of
duration
with
its
symbol
a
closer
study
of
this
second
definition
of
freedom
will
thus
bring
us
once
more
to
determinism
shall
we
finally
define
the
free
act
by
saying
that
it
is
not
necessarily
determined
by
its
cause
but
either
these
words
lose
their
meaning
or
we
understand
by
them
that
the
same
inner
causes
will
not
always
call
forth
the
same
effects
we
admit
then
that
the
psychic
antecedents
of
a
free
act
can
be
repeated
that
freedom
is
displayed
in
a
duration
whose
moments
resemble
one
another
and
that
time
is
a
homogeneous
medium
like
space
we
shall
thus
be
brought
back
to
the
idea
of
an
equivalence
between
duration
and
its
spatial
symbol
and
by
pressing
the
definition
of
freedom
which
we
have
laid
down
we
shall
once
more
get
determinism
out
of
it
to
sum
up
every
demand
for
explanation
in
regard
to
freedom
comes
back
without
our
suspecting
it
to
the
following
question
can
time
be
adequately
represented
by
space
to
which
we
answer
yes
if
you
are
dealing
with
time
flown
no
if
you
speak
of
time
flowing
now
the
free
act
takes
place
in
time
which
is
flowing
and
not
in
time
which
has
already
flown
freedom
is
therefore
a
fact
and
among
the
facts
which
we
observe
there
is
none
clearer
all
the
difficulties
of
the
problem
and
the
problem
itself
arise
from
the
desire
to
endow
duration
with
the
same
attributes
as
extensity
to
interpret
a
succession
by
a
simultaneity
and
to
express
the
idea
of
freedom
in
a
language
into
which
it
is
obviously
untranslatable
conclusion
sidenote
modern
psychology
holds
hat
we
perceive
things
through
forms
borrowed
from
our
own
constitution
to
sum
up
the
foregoing
discussion
we
shall
put
aside
for
the
present
kant
terminology
and
also
his
doctrine
to
which
we
shall
return
later
and
we
shall
take
the
point
of
view
of
common
sense
modern
psychology
seems
to
us
particularly
concerned
to
prove
that
we
perceive
things
through
the
medium
of
certain
forms
borrowed
from
our
own
constitution
this
tendency
has
become
more
and
more
marked
since
kant
while
the
german
philosopher
drew
a
sharp
line
of
separation
between
time
and
space
the
extensive
and
the
intensive
and
as
we
should
say
consciousness
and
external
perception
the
empirical
school
carrying
analysis
still
further
tries
to
reconstruct
the
extensive
out
of
the
intensive
space
out
of
duration
and
externality
out
of
inner
states
physics
moreover
comes
in
to
complete
the
work
of
psychology
in
this
respect
it
shows
that
if
we
wish
to
forecast
phenomena
we
must
make
a
clean
sweep
of
the
impression
which
they
produce
on
consciousness
and
treat
sensations
as
signs
of
reality
not
as
reality
itself
sidenote
but
are
not
the
states
of
the
self
perceived
through
forms
borrowed
from
the
external
world
it
seemed
to
us
that
there
was
good
reason
to
set
ourselves
the
opposite
problem
and
to
ask
whether
the
most
obvious
states
of
the
ego
itself
which
we
believe
that
we
grasp
directly
are
not
mostly
perceived
through
the
medium
of
certain
forms
borrowed
from
the
external
world
which
thus
gives
us
back
what
we
have
lent
it
it
seems
fairly
probable
that
this
is
what
happens
for
assuming
that
the
forms
alluded
to
into
which
we
fit
matter
come
entirely
from
the
mind
it
seems
difficult
to
apply
them
constantly
to
objects
without
the
latter
soon
leaving
a
mark
on
them
by
then
using
these
forms
to
gain
a
knowledge
of
our
own
person
we
run
the
risk
of
mistaking
for
the
colouring
of
the
self
the
reflection
of
the
frame
in
which
we
place
it
the
external
world
but
one
can
go
further
still
and
assert
that
forms
applicable
to
things
can
not
be
entirely
our
own
work
that
they
must
result
from
a
compromise
between
matter
and
mind
that
if
we
give
much
to
matter
we
probably
receive
something
from
it
and
that
thus
when
we
try
to
grasp
ourselves
after
an
excursion
into
the
external
world
we
no
longer
have
our
hands
free
sidenote
to
understand
the
intensity
duration
and
voluntary
determination
of
psychic
states
we
must
eliminate
the
idea
of
space
now
just
as
in
order
to
ascertain
the
real
relations
of
physical
phenomena
to
one
another
we
abstract
whatever
obviously
clashes
with
them
in
our
way
of
perceiving
and
thinking
so
in
order
to
view
the
self
in
its
original
purity
psychology
ought
to
eliminate
or
correct
certain
forms
which
bear
the
obvious
mark
of
the
external
world
what
are
these
forms
when
isolated
from
one
another
and
regarded
as
so
many
distinct
units
psychic
states
seem
to
be
more
or
less
next
looked
at
in
their
multiplicity
they
unfold
in
time
and
constitute
finally
in
their
relations
to
one
another
and
in
so
far
as
a
certain
unity
is
preserved
throughout
their
multiplicity
they
seem
to
one
another
intensity
duration
voluntary
determination
these
are
the
three
ideas
which
had
to
be
clarified
by
ridding
them
of
all
that
they
owe
to
the
intrusion
of
the
sensible
world
and
in
a
word
to
the
obsession
of
the
idea
of
space
sidenote
intensity
is
quality
and
not
quantity
or
magnitude
examining
the
first
of
these
ideas
we
found
that
psychic
phenomena
were
in
themselves
pure
quality
or
qualitative
multiplicity
and
that
on
the
other
hand
their
cause
situated
in
space
was
quantity
in
so
far
as
this
quality
becomes
the
sign
of
the
quantity
and
we
suspect
the
presence
of
the
latter
behind
the
former
we
call
it
intensity
the
intensity
of
a
simple
state
therefore
is
not
quantity
but
its
qualitative
sign
you
will
find
that
it
arises
from
a
compromise
between
pure
quality
which
is
the
state
of
consciousness
and
pure
quantity
which
is
necessarily
space
now
you
give
up
this
compromise
without
the
least
scruple
when
you
study
external
things
since
you
then
leave
aside
the
forces
themselves
assuming
that
they
exist
and
consider
only
their
measurable
and
extended
effects
why
then
do
you
keep
to
this
hybrid
concept
when
you
analyse
in
its
turn
the
state
of
consciousness
if
magnitude
outside
you
is
never
intensive
intensity
within
you
is
never
magnitude
it
is
through
having
overlooked
this
that
philosophers
have
been
compelled
to
distinguish
two
kinds
of
quantity
the
one
extensive
the
other
intensive
without
ever
succeeding
in
explaining
what
they
had
in
common
or
how
the
same
words
increase
and
decrease
could
be
used
for
things
so
unlike
in
the
same
way
they
are
responsible
for
the
exaggerations
of
psychophysics
for
as
soon
as
the
power
of
increasing
in
magnitude
is
attributed
to
sensation
in
any
other
than
a
metaphorical
sense
we
are
invited
to
find
out
by
how
much
it
increases
and
although
consciousness
does
not
measure
intensive
quantity
it
does
not
follow
that
science
may
not
succeed
indirectly
in
doing
so
if
it
be
a
magnitude
hence
either
a
psychophysical
formula
is
possible
or
the
intensity
of
a
simple
psychic
state
is
pure
quality
sidenote
our
conscious
states
not
a
discreet
multiplicity
turning
then
to
the
concept
of
multiplicity
we
saw
that
to
construct
a
number
we
must
first
have
the
intuition
of
a
homogeneous
medium
viz
space
in
which
terms
distinct
from
one
another
could
be
set
out
in
line
and
secondly
a
process
of
permeation
and
organization
by
which
these
units
are
dynamically
added
together
and
form
what
we
called
a
qualitative
multiplicity
it
is
owing
to
this
dynamic
process
that
the
units
added
but
it
is
because
of
their
presence
in
space
that
they
remain
hence
number
or
discrete
multiplicity
also
results
from
a
compromise
now
when
we
consider
material
objects
in
themselves
we
give
up
this
compromise
since
we
regard
them
as
impenetrable
and
divisible
endlessly
distinct
from
one
another
therefore
we
must
give
it
up
too
when
we
study
our
own
selves
it
is
through
having
failed
to
do
so
that
associationism
has
made
many
mistakes
such
as
trying
to
reconstruct
a
psychic
state
by
the
addition
of
distinct
states
of
consciousness
thus
substituting
the
symbol
of
the
ego
for
the
ego
itself
these
preliminary
considerations
enabled
us
to
approach
the
principal
object
of
this
work
the
analysis
of
the
ideas
of
duration
and
voluntary
determination
sidenote
inner
duration
is
a
qualitative
multiplicity
what
is
duration
within
us
a
qualitative
multiplicity
with
no
likeness
to
number
an
organic
evolution
which
is
yet
not
an
increasing
quantity
a
pure
heterogeneity
within
which
there
are
no
distinct
qualities
in
a
word
the
moments
of
inner
duration
are
not
external
to
one
another
sidenote
in
the
external
we
find
not
duration
but
simultaneity
what
duration
is
there
existing
outside
us
the
present
only
or
if
we
prefer
the
expression
simultaneity
no
doubt
external
things
change
but
their
moments
do
not
one
another
if
we
retain
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
except
for
a
consciousness
which
keeps
them
in
mind
we
observe
outside
us
at
a
given
moment
a
whole
system
of
simultaneous
positions
of
the
simultaneities
which
have
preceded
them
nothing
remains
to
put
duration
in
space
is
really
to
contradict
oneself
and
place
succession
within
simultaneity
hence
we
must
not
say
that
external
things
but
rather
that
there
is
in
them
some
inexpressible
reason
in
virtue
of
which
we
can
not
examine
them
at
successive
moments
of
our
own
duration
without
observing
that
they
have
changed
but
this
change
does
not
involve
succession
unless
the
word
is
taken
in
a
new
meaning
on
this
point
we
have
noted
the
agreement
of
science
and
common
sense
thus
in
consciousness
we
find
states
which
succeed
without
being
distinguished
from
one
another
and
in
space
simultaneities
which
without
succeeding
are
distinguished
from
one
another
in
the
sense
that
one
has
ceased
to
exist
when
the
other
appears
outside
us
mutual
externality
without
succession
within
us
succession
without
mutual
externality
sidenote
the
idea
of
a
measurable
time
arises
from
compromise
between
ideas
of
succession
and
externality
here
again
a
compromise
comes
in
to
the
simultaneities
which
constitute
the
external
world
and
although
distinct
succeed
one
another
our
consciousness
we
attribute
succession
hence
the
idea
that
things
as
we
do
ourselves
and
that
time
may
be
brought
within
space
but
while
our
consciousness
thus
introduces
succession
into
external
things
inversely
these
things
themselves
externalize
the
successive
moments
of
our
inner
duration
in
relation
to
one
another
the
simultaneities
of
physical
phenomena
absolutely
distinct
in
the
sense
that
the
one
has
ceased
to
be
when
the
other
takes
place
cut
up
into
portions
which
are
also
distinct
and
external
to
one
another
an
inner
life
in
which
succession
implies
interpenetration
just
as
the
pendulum
of
a
clock
cuts
up
into
distinct
fragments
and
spreads
out
so
to
speak
lengthwise
the
dynamic
and
undivided
tension
of
the
spring
thus
by
a
real
process
of
endosmosis
we
get
the
mixed
idea
of
a
measurable
time
which
is
space
in
so
far
as
it
is
homogeneity
and
duration
in
so
far
as
it
is
succession
that
is
to
say
at
bottom
the
contradictory
idea
of
succession
in
simultaneity
sidenote
as
science
eliminates
duration
from
the
outer
philosophy
must
eliminate
space
from
the
inner
world
now
these
two
elements
extensity
and
duration
science
tears
asunder
when
it
undertakes
the
close
study
of
external
things
for
we
have
pointed
out
that
science
retains
nothing
of
duration
but
simultaneity
and
nothing
of
motion
itself
position
of
the
moving
body
immobility
a
very
sharp
separation
is
here
made
and
space
gets
the
best
of
it
therefore
the
same
separation
will
have
to
be
made
again
but
this
time
to
the
advantage
of
duration
when
inner
phenomena
are
studied
not
inner
phenomena
once
developed
to
be
sure
or
after
the
discursive
reason
has
separated
them
and
set
them
out
in
a
homogeneous
medium
in
order
to
understand
them
but
inner
phenomena
in
their
developing
and
in
so
far
as
they
make
up
by
their
interpenetration
the
continuous
evolution
of
a
free
person
duration
thus
restored
to
its
original
purity
will
appear
as
a
wholly
qualitative
multiplicity
an
absolute
heterogeneity
of
elements
which
pass
over
into
one
another
sidenote
the
neglect
to
separate
extensity
and
duration
leads
one
party
to
deny
freedom
and
the
other
to
define
it
now
it
is
because
they
have
neglected
to
make
this
necessary
separation
that
one
party
has
been
led
to
deny
freedom
and
the
other
to
define
it
and
thereby
involuntarily
to
deny
it
too
they
ask
in
fact
whether
the
act
could
or
could
not
be
foreseen
the
whole
of
its
conditions
being
given
and
whether
they
assert
it
or
deny
it
they
admit
that
this
totality
of
conditions
could
be
conceived
as
given
in
advance
which
amounts
as
we
have
shown
to
treating
duration
as
a
homogeneous
thing
and
intensities
as
magnitudes
they
will
either
say
that
the
act
is
by
its
conditions
without
perceiving
that
they
are
playing
on
the
double
sense
of
the
word
causality
and
that
they
are
thus
giving
to
duration
at
the
same
time
two
forms
which
are
mutually
exclusive
or
else
they
will
appeal
to
the
principle
of
the
conservation
of
energy
without
asking
whether
this
principle
is
equally
applicable
to
the
moments
of
the
external
world
which
are
equivalent
to
one
another
and
to
the
moments
of
a
living
and
conscious
being
which
acquire
a
richer
and
richer
content
in
whatever
way
in
a
word
freedom
is
viewed
it
can
not
be
denied
except
on
condition
of
identifying
time
with
space
it
can
not
be
defined
except
on
condition
of
demanding
that
space
should
adequately
represent
time
it
can
not
be
argued
about
in
one
sense
or
the
other
except
on
condition
of
previously
confusing
succession
and
simultaneity
all
determinism
will
thus
be
refuted
by
experience
but
every
attempt
to
define
freedom
will
open
the
way
to
determinism
sidenote
this
separation
favourable
to
physical
science
but
against
the
interests
of
language
and
social
life
inquiring
then
why
this
separation
of
duration
and
extensity
which
science
carries
out
so
naturally
in
the
external
world
demands
such
an
effort
and
rouses
so
much
repugnance
when
it
is
a
question
of
inner
states
we
were
not
long
in
perceiving
the
reason
the
main
object
of
science
is
to
forecast
and
measure
now
we
can
not
forecast
physical
phenomena
except
on
condition
that
we
assume
that
they
do
not
as
we
do
and
on
the
other
hand
the
only
thing
we
are
able
to
measure
is
space
hence
the
breach
here
comes
about
of
itself
between
quality
and
quantity
between
true
duration
and
pure
extensity
but
when
we
turn
to
our
conscious
states
we
have
everything
to
gain
by
keeping
up
the
illusion
through
which
we
make
them
share
in
the
reciprocal
externality
of
outer
things
because
this
distinctness
and
at
the
same
time
this
solidification
enables
us
to
give
them
fixed
names
in
spite
of
their
instability
and
distinct
ones
in
spite
of
their
interpenetration
it
enables
us
to
objectify
them
to
throw
them
out
into
the
current
of
social
life
sidenote
hence
two
different
selves
the
fundamental
self
its
spatial
and
social
representation
only
the
former
is
free
hence
there
are
finally
two
different
selves
one
of
which
is
as
it
were
the
external
projection
of
the
other
its
spatial
and
so
to
speak
social
representation
we
reach
the
former
by
deep
introspection
which
leads
us
to
grasp
our
inner
states
as
living
things
constantly
as
states
not
amenable
to
measure
which
permeate
one
another
and
of
which
the
succession
in
duration
has
nothing
in
common
with
juxtaposition
in
homogeneous
space
but
the
moments
at
which
we
thus
grasp
ourselves
are
rare
and
that
is
just
why
we
are
rarely
free
the
greater
part
of
the
time
we
live
outside
ourselves
hardly
perceiving
anything
of
ourselves
but
our
own
ghost
a
colourless
shadow
which
pure
duration
projects
into
homogeneous
space
hence
our
life
unfolds
in
space
rather
than
in
time
we
live
for
the
external
world
rather
than
for
ourselves
we
speak
rather
than
think
we
are
acted
rather
than
act
ourselves
to
act
freely
is
to
recover
possession
of
oneself
and
to
get
back
into
pure
duration
sidenote
kant
clung
to
freedom
but
put
the
self
which
is
free
outside
both
space
and
time
kant
great
mistake
was
to
take
time
as
a
homogeneous
medium
he
did
not
notice
that
real
duration
is
made
up
of
moments
inside
one
another
and
that
when
it
seems
to
assume
the
form
of
a
homogeneous
whole
it
is
because
it
gets
expressed
in
space
thus
the
very
distinction
which
he
makes
between
space
and
time
amounts
at
bottom
to
confusing
time
with
space
and
the
symbolical
representation
of
the
ego
with
the
ego
itself
he
thought
that
consciousness
was
incapable
of
perceiving
psychic
states
otherwise
than
by
juxtaposition
forgetting
that
a
medium
in
which
these
states
are
set
side
by
side
and
distinguished
from
one
another
is
of
course
space
and
not
duration
he
was
thereby
led
to
believe
that
the
same
states
can
recur
in
the
depths
of
consciousness
just
as
the
same
physical
phenomena
are
repeated
in
space
this
at
least
is
what
he
implicitly
admitted
when
he
ascribed
to
the
causal
relation
the
same
meaning
and
the
same
function
in
the
inner
as
in
the
outer
world
thus
freedom
was
made
into
an
incomprehensible
fact
and
yet
owing
to
his
unlimited
though
unconscious
confidence
in
this
inner
perception
whose
scope
he
tried
to
restrict
his
belief
in
freedom
remained
unshakable
he
therefore
raised
it
to
the
sphere
of
noumena
and
as
he
had
confused
duration
with
space
he
made
this
genuine
free
self
which
is
indeed
outside
space
into
a
self
which
is
supposed
to
be
outside
duration
too
and
therefore
out
of
the
reach
of
our
faculty
of
knowledge
but
the
truth
is
that
we
perceive
this
self
whenever
by
a
strenuous
effort
of
reflection
we
turn
our
eyes
from
the
shadow
which
follows
us
and
retire
into
ourselves
though
we
generally
live
and
act
outside
our
own
person
in
space
rather
than
in
duration
and
though
by
this
means
we
give
a
handle
to
the
law
of
causality
which
binds
the
same
effects
to
the
same
causes
we
can
nevertheless
always
get
back
into
pure
duration
of
which
the
moments
are
internal
and
heterogeneous
to
one
another
and
in
which
a
cause
can
not
repeat
its
effect
since
it
will
never
repeat
itself
sidenote
kant
regarded
both
space
and
time
as
homogeneous
in
this
very
confusion
of
true
duration
with
its
symbol
both
the
strength
and
the
weakness
of
kantianism
reside
kant
imagines
on
the
one
side
things
in
themselves
and
on
the
other
a
homogeneous
time
and
space
through
which
the
things
in
themselves
are
refracted
thus
are
supposed
to
arise
on
the
one
hand
the
phenomenal
self
a
self
which
consciousness
perceives
and
on
the
other
external
objects
time
and
space
on
this
view
would
not
be
any
more
in
us
than
outside
us
the
very
distinction
of
outside
and
inside
would
be
the
work
of
time
and
space
this
doctrine
has
the
advantage
of
providing
our
empirical
thought
with
a
solid
foundation
and
of
guaranteeing
that
phenomena
as
phenomena
are
adequately
knowable
indeed
we
might
set
up
these
phenomena
as
absolute
and
do
without
the
incomprehensible
things
in
themselves
were
it
not
that
the
practical
reason
the
revealer
of
duty
came
in
like
the
platonic
reminiscence
to
warn
us
that
the
thing
in
itself
exists
invisible
but
present
the
controlling
factor
in
the
whole
of
this
theory
is
the
very
sharp
distinction
between
the
matter
of
consciousness
and
its
form
between
the
homogeneous
and
the
heterogeneous
and
this
vital
distinction
would
probably
never
have
been
made
unless
time
also
had
been
regarded
as
a
medium
indifferent
to
what
fills
it
sidenote
but
if
time
as
duration
were
homogeneous
science
could
deal
with
it
but
if
time
as
immediate
consciousness
perceives
it
were
like
space
a
homogeneous
medium
science
would
be
able
to
deal
with
it
as
it
can
with
space
now
we
have
tried
to
prove
that
duration
as
duration
and
motion
as
motion
elude
the
grasp
of
mathematics
of
time
everything
slips
through
its
fingers
but
simultaneity
and
of
movement
everything
but
immobility
this
is
what
the
kantians
and
even
their
opponents
do
not
seem
to
have
perceived
in
this
phenomenal
world
which
we
are
told
is
a
world
cut
out
for
scientific
knowledge
all
the
relations
which
can
not
be
translated
into
simultaneity
into
space
are
scientifically
unknowable
sidenote
and
freedom
would
be
incomprehensible
kant
solution
in
the
second
place
in
a
duration
assumed
to
be
homogeneous
the
same
states
could
occur
over
again
causality
would
imply
necessary
determination
and
all
freedom
would
become
incomprehensible
such
indeed
is
the
result
to
which
the
critique
of
pure
reason
leads
but
instead
of
concluding
from
this
that
real
duration
is
heterogeneous
which
by
clearing
up
the
second
difficulty
would
have
called
his
attention
to
the
first
kant
preferred
to
put
freedom
outside
time
and
to
raise
an
impassable
barrier
between
the
world
of
phenomena
which
he
hands
over
root
and
branch
to
our
understanding
and
the
world
of
things
in
themselves
which
he
forbids
us
to
enter
sidenote
how
corrected
by
taking
real
duration
into
account
but
perhaps
this
distinction
is
too
sharply
drawn
and
perhaps
the
barrier
is
easier
to
cross
than
he
supposed
for
if
perchance
the
moments
of
real
duration
perceived
by
an
attentive
consciousness
permeated
one
another
instead
of
lying
side
by
side
and
if
these
moments
formed
in
relation
to
one
another
a
heterogeneity
within
which
the
idea
of
necessary
determination
lost
every
shred
of
meaning
then
the
self
grasped
by
consciousness
would
be
a
free
cause
we
should
have
absolute
knowledge
of
ourselves
and
on
the
other
hand
just
because
this
absolute
constantly
commingles
with
phenomena
and
while
filling
itself
with
them
permeates
them
these
phenomena
themselves
would
not
be
as
amenable
as
is
claimed
to
mathematical
reasoning
sidenote
with
kant
we
assume
a
homogeneous
space
the
intuition
of
which
is
peculiar
to
man
and
prepares
the
way
for
social
life
so
we
have
assumed
the
existence
of
a
homogeneous
space
and
with
kant
distinguished
this
space
from
the
matter
which
fills
it
with
him
we
have
admitted
that
homogeneous
space
is
a
form
of
our
sensibility
and
we
understand
by
this
simply
that
other
minds
those
of
animals
social
life
although
they
perceive
objects
do
not
distinguish
them
so
clearly
either
from
one
another
or
from
themselves
this
intuition
of
a
homogeneous
medium
an
intuition
peculiar
to
man
enables
us
to
externalize
our
concepts
in
relation
to
one
another
reveals
to
us
the
objectivity
of
things
and
thus
in
two
ways
on
the
one
hand
by
getting
everything
ready
for
language
and
on
the
other
by
showing
us
an
external
world
quite
distinct
from
ourselves
in
the
perception
of
which
all
minds
have
a
common
share
foreshadows
and
prepares
the
way
for
social
life
sidenote
but
if
concrete
duration
is
heterogeneous
the
relation
of
psychic
state
to
act
is
unique
and
the
act
is
rightly
judged
free
over
against
this
homogeneous
space
we
have
put
the
self
as
perceived
by
an
attentive
consciousness
a
living
self
whose
states
at
once
undistinguished
and
unstable
can
not
separated
without
changing
their
nature
and
can
not
receive
a
fixed
form
or
be
expressed
in
words
without
becoming
public
property
how
could
this
self
which
distinguishes
external
objects
so
sharply
and
represents
them
so
easily
by
means
of
symbols
withstand
the
temptation
to
introduce
the
same
distinctions
into
its
own
life
and
to
replace
the
interpenetration
of
its
psychic
states
their
wholly
qualitative
multiplicity
by
a
numerical
plurality
of
terms
which
are
distinguished
from
one
another
set
side
by
side
and
expressed
by
means
of
words
in
place
of
a
heterogeneous
duration
whose
moments
permeate
one
another
we
thus
get
a
homogeneous
time
whose
moments
are
strung
on
a
spatial
line
in
place
of
an
inner
life
whose
successive
phases
each
unique
of
its
kind
can
not
be
expressed
in
the
fixed
terms
of
language
we
get
a
self
which
can
be
artificially
reconstructed
and
simple
psychic
states
which
can
be
added
to
and
taken
from
one
another
just
like
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
in
forming
words
now
this
must
not
be
thought
to
be
a
mode
of
symbolical
representation
only
for
immediate
intuition
and
discursive
thought
are
one
in
concrete
reality
and
the
very
mechanism
by
which
we
only
meant
at
first
to
explain
our
conduct
will
end
by
also
controlling
it
our
psychic
states
separating
then
from
each
other
will
get
solidified
between
our
ideas
thus
crystallized
and
our
external
movements
we
shall
witness
permanent
associations
being
formed
and
little
by
little
as
our
consciousness
thus
imitates
the
process
by
which
nervous
matter
procures
reflex
actions
automatism
will
cover
over
freedom
it
is
just
at
this
point
that
the
associationists
and
the
determinists
come
in
on
the
one
side
and
the
kantians
on
the
other
as
they
look
at
only
the
commonest
aspect
of
our
conscious
life
they
perceive
clearly
marked
states
which
can
recur
in
time
like
physical
phenomena
and
to
which
the
law
of
causal
determination
applies
if
we
wish
in
the
same
sense
as
it
does
to
nature
as
on
the
other
hand
the
medium
in
which
these
psychic
states
are
set
side
by
side
exhibits
parts
external
to
one
another
in
which
the
same
facts
seem
capable
of
being
repeated
they
do
not
hesitate
to
make
time
a
homogeneous
medium
and
treat
it
as
space
henceforth
all
difference
between
duration
and
extensity
succession
and
simultaneity
is
abolished
the
only
thing
left
is
to
turn
freedom
out
of
doors
or
if
you
can
not
entirely
throw
off
your
traditional
respect
for
it
to
escort
it
with
all
due
ceremony
up
to
the
supratemporal
domain
of
things
in
themselves
whose
mysterious
threshold
your
consciousness
can
not
cross
but
in
our
view
there
is
a
third
course
which
might
be
taken
namely
to
carry
ourselves
back
in
thought
to
those
moments
of
our
life
when
we
made
some
serious
decision
moments
unique
of
their
kind
which
will
never
be
repeated
more
than
the
past
phases
in
the
history
of
a
nation
will
ever
come
back
again
we
should
see
that
if
these
past
states
can
not
be
adequately
expressed
in
words
or
artificially
reconstructed
by
a
juxtaposition
of
simpler
states
it
is
because
in
their
dynamic
unity
and
wholly
qualitative
multiplicity
they
are
phases
of
our
real
and
concrete
duration
a
heterogeneous
duration
and
a
living
one
we
should
see
that
if
our
action
was
pronounced
by
us
to
be
free
it
is
because
the
relation
of
this
action
to
the
state
from
which
it
issued
could
not
be
expressed
by
a
law
this
psychic
state
being
unique
of
its
kind
and
unable
ever
to
occur
again
we
should
see
finally
that
the
very
idea
of
necessary
determination
here
loses
every
shred
of
meaning
that
there
can
not
be
any
question
either
of
foreseeing
the
act
before
it
is
performed
or
of
reasoning
about
the
possibility
of
the
contrary
action
once
the
deed
is
done
for
to
have
all
the
conditions
given
is
in
concrete
duration
to
place
oneself
at
the
very
moment
of
the
act
and
not
to
foresee
it
but
we
should
also
understand
the
illusion
which
makes
the
one
party
think
that
they
are
compelled
to
deny
freedom
and
the
others
that
they
must
define
it
it
is
because
the
transition
is
made
by
imperceptible
steps
from
concrete
duration
whose
elements
permeate
one
another
to
symbolical
duration
whose
moments
are
set
side
by
side
and
consequently
from
free
activity
to
conscious
automatism
it
is
because
although
we
are
free
whenever
we
are
willing
to
get
back
into
ourselves
it
seldom
happens
that
we
are
willing
it
is
because
finally
even
in
the
cases
where
the
action
is
freely
performed
we
can
not
reason
about
it
without
setting
out
its
conditions
externally
to
one
another
therefore
in
space
and
no
longer
in
pure
duration
the
problem
of
freedom
has
thus
sprung
from
a
misunderstanding
it
has
been
to
the
moderns
what
the
paradoxes
of
the
eleatics
were
to
the
ancients
and
like
these
paradoxes
it
has
its
origin
in
the
illusion
through
which
we
confuse
succession
and
simultaneity
duration
and
extensity
quality
and
quantity

this
point

goes
on
as
it

unknown
to
ourselves
in
the
obscure
depths
of

at

of

that
the

duration
comes
from

source

without

and
continuous
duration

would

problem
of
