an
incident
on
route
by
james
schmitz
he
was
already
a
thief
prepared
to
steal
again
he
did
know
that
he
himself
was
only
booty
phil
garfield
was
thirty
miles
south
of
the
little
town
of
redmon
on
route
twelve
when
he
was
startled
by
a
series
of
sharp
clanking
noises
they
came
from
under
the
packard
hood
the
car
immediately
began
to
lose
speed
garfield
jammed
down
the
accelerator
had
a
sense
of
sick
helplessness
at
the
complete
lack
of
response
from
the
motor
the
packard
rolled
on
getting
rid
of
its
momentum
and
came
to
a
stop
phil
garfield
swore
shakily
he
checked
his
watch
switched
off
the
headlights
and
climbed
out
into
the
dark
road
a
delay
of
even
half
an
hour
here
might
be
disastrous
it
was
past
midnight
and
he
had
another
hundred
and
ten
miles
to
cover
to
reach
the
small
private
airfield
where
madge
waited
for
him
and
the
thirty
thousand
dollars
in
the
suitcase
on
the
packard
front
seat
if
he
did
make
it
before
daylight
he
thought
of
the
bank
guard
the
man
had
made
a
clumsy
play
at
being
a
hero
and
that
had
set
off
the
fool
woman
who
run
screaming
into
their
line
of
fire
one
dead
perhaps
two
garfield
had
stopped
to
look
at
an
evening
paper
but
he
knew
they
were
hunting
for
him
he
glanced
up
and
down
the
road
no
other
headlights
in
sight
at
the
moment
no
light
from
a
building
showing
on
the
forested
hills
he
reached
back
into
the
car
and
brought
out
the
suitcase
his
gun
a
big
flashlight
and
the
box
of
shells
which
had
been
standing
beside
the
suitcase
he
broke
the
box
open
shoved
a
handful
of
shells
and
the
into
his
coat
pocket
then
took
suitcase
and
flashlight
over
to
the
shoulder
of
the
road
and
set
them
down
there
was
no
point
in
groping
about
under
the
packard
hood
when
it
came
to
mechanics
phil
garfield
was
a
moron
and
well
aware
of
it
the
car
was
useless
to
him
now
except
as
bait
but
as
bait
it
might
be
very
useful
should
he
leave
it
standing
where
it
was
no
garfield
decided
to
anybody
driving
past
it
would
merely
suggest
a
necking
party
or
a
drunk
sleeping
off
his
load
before
continuing
home
he
might
have
to
wait
an
hour
or
more
before
someone
decided
to
stop
he
did
have
the
time
he
reached
in
through
the
window
hauled
the
top
of
the
steering
wheel
towards
him
and
put
his
weight
against
the
rear
window
frame
the
packard
began
to
move
slowly
backwards
at
a
slant
across
the
road
in
a
minute
or
two
he
had
it
in
position
not
blocking
the
road
entirely
which
would
arouse
immediate
suspicion
but
angled
across
it
lights
out
empty
both
front
doors
open
and
inviting
a
investigation
garfield
carried
the
suitcase
and
flashlight
across
the
shoulder
of
the
road
and
moved
up
among
the
trees
and
undergrowth
of
the
slope
above
the
shoulder
placing
the
suitcase
between
the
bushes
he
brought
out
the
clicked
the
safety
off
and
stood
waiting
some
ten
minutes
later
a
set
of
headlights
appeared
speeding
up
route
twelve
from
the
direction
of
redmon
phil
garfield
went
down
on
one
knee
before
he
came
within
range
of
the
lights
now
he
was
completely
concealed
by
the
vegetation
the
car
slowed
as
it
approached
braking
nearly
to
a
stop
sixty
feet
from
the
stalled
packard
there
were
several
people
inside
it
garfield
heard
voices
then
a
woman
loud
laugh
the
driver
tapped
his
horn
inquiringly
twice
moved
the
car
slowly
forward
as
the
headlights
went
past
him
garfield
got
to
his
feet
among
the
bushes
took
a
step
down
towards
the
road
raising
the
gun
then
he
caught
the
distant
gleam
of
a
second
set
of
headlights
approaching
from
redmon
he
swore
under
his
breath
and
dropped
back
out
of
sight
the
car
below
him
reached
the
packard
edged
cautiously
around
it
rolled
on
with
a
sudden
roar
of
acceleration
the
second
car
stopped
when
still
a
hundred
yards
away
the
packard
caught
in
the
motionless
glare
of
its
lights
garfield
heard
the
steady
purring
of
a
powerful
motor
for
almost
a
minute
nothing
else
happened
then
the
car
came
gliding
smoothly
on
stopped
again
no
more
than
thirty
feet
to
garfield
left
he
could
see
it
now
through
the
screening
bushes
a
big
job
a
long
low
sedan
the
motor
continued
to
purr
after
a
moment
a
door
on
the
far
side
of
the
car
opened
and
slammed
shut
a
man
walked
quickly
out
into
the
beam
of
the
headlights
and
started
towards
the
packard
phil
garfield
rose
from
his
crouching
position
the
in
his
right
hand
flashlight
in
his
left
if
the
driver
was
alone
the
thing
was
now
cinched
but
if
there
was
somebody
else
in
the
car
somebody
capable
of
fast
decisive
action
a
slip
in
the
next
ten
seconds
might
cost
him
the
sedan
and
quite
probably
his
freedom
and
life
garfield
lined
up
the
sights
steadily
on
the
center
of
the
approaching
man
head
he
let
his
breath
out
slowly
as
the
fellow
came
level
with
him
in
the
road
and
squeezed
off
one
shot
instantly
he
went
bounding
down
the
slope
to
the
road
the
bullet
had
flung
the
man
sideways
to
the
pavement
garfield
darted
past
him
to
the
left
crossed
the
beam
of
the
headlights
and
was
in
darkness
again
on
the
far
side
of
the
road
snapping
on
his
flashlight
as
he
sprinted
up
to
the
car
the
motor
hummed
quietly
on
the
flashlight
showed
the
seats
empty
garfield
dropped
the
light
jerked
both
doors
open
in
turn
gun
pointing
into
the
car
interior
then
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
weak
and
almost
dizzy
with
relief
there
was
no
one
inside
the
sedan
was
his
the
man
he
had
shot
through
the
head
lay
face
down
on
the
road
his
hat
flung
a
dozen
feet
away
from
him
route
twelve
still
stretched
out
in
dark
silence
to
east
and
west
there
should
be
time
enough
to
clean
up
the
job
before
anyone
else
came
along
garfield
brought
the
suitcase
down
and
put
it
on
the
front
seat
of
the
sedan
then
started
back
to
get
his
victim
off
the
road
and
out
of
sight
he
scaled
the
man
hat
into
the
bushes
bent
down
grasped
the
ankles
and
started
to
haul
him
towards
the
left
side
of
the
road
where
the
ground
dropped
off
sharply
beyond
the
shoulder
the
body
made
a
high
squealing
sound
and
began
to
writhe
violently
shocked
garfield
dropped
the
legs
and
hurriedly
took
the
gun
from
his
pocket
moving
back
a
step
the
squealing
noise
rose
in
intensity
as
the
wounded
man
quickly
flopped
over
twice
like
a
struggling
fish
arms
and
legs
sawing
about
with
startling
energy
garfield
clicked
off
the
safety
pumped
three
shots
into
his
victim
back
the
grisly
squeals
ended
abruptly
the
body
continued
to
jerk
for
another
second
or
two
then
lay
still
garfield
shoved
the
gun
back
into
his
pocket
the
unexpected
interruption
had
unnerved
him
his
hands
shook
as
he
reached
down
again
for
the
stranger
ankles
then
he
jerked
his
hands
back
and
straightened
up
staring
from
the
side
of
the
man
chest
a
few
inches
below
the
right
arm
something
like
a
thick
black
stick
three
feet
long
protruded
now
through
the
material
of
the
coat
it
shone
gleaming
wetly
in
the
light
from
the
car
even
in
that
first
uncomprehending
instant
something
in
its
appearance
brought
a
surge
of
sick
disgust
to
garfield
throat
then
the
stick
bent
slowly
halfway
down
its
length
forming
a
sharp
angle
and
its
tip
opened
into
what
could
have
been
three
blunt
black
claws
which
scrabbled
clumsily
against
the
pavement
very
faintly
the
squealing
began
again
and
the
body
back
arched
up
as
if
another
sticklike
arm
were
pushing
desperately
against
the
ground
beneath
it
garfield
acted
in
a
blur
of
horror
he
emptied
the
into
the
thing
at
his
feet
almost
without
realizing
he
was
doing
it
then
dropping
the
gun
he
seized
one
of
the
ankles
ran
backwards
to
the
shoulder
of
the
road
dragging
the
body
behind
him
in
the
darkness
at
the
edge
of
the
shoulder
he
let
go
of
it
stepped
around
to
the
other
side
and
with
two
frantically
savage
kicks
sent
the
body
plunging
over
the
shoulder
and
down
the
steep
slope
beyond
he
heard
it
crash
through
the
bushes
for
some
seconds
then
stop
he
turned
and
ran
back
to
the
sedan
scooping
up
his
gun
as
he
went
past
he
scrambled
into
the
driver
seat
and
slammed
the
door
shut
behind
him
his
hands
shook
violently
on
the
steering
wheel
as
he
pressed
down
the
accelerator
the
motor
roared
into
life
and
the
big
car
surged
forward
he
edged
it
past
the
packard
cursing
aloud
in
horrified
shock
jammed
down
the
accelerator
and
went
flashing
up
route
twelve
darkness
racing
beside
and
behind
him
had
it
been
something
that
wore
what
seemed
to
be
a
man
body
like
a
suit
of
clothes
moving
the
body
as
a
man
moves
driving
a
car
itself
garfield
drew
a
long
shuddering
breath
then
as
he
slowed
for
a
curve
there
was
a
spark
of
reddish
light
in
the
mirror
he
stared
at
the
spark
for
an
instant
braked
the
car
to
a
stop
rolled
down
the
window
and
looked
back
far
behind
him
along
route
twelve
a
fire
burned
approximately
at
the
point
where
the
packard
had
stalled
out
where
something
had
gone
rolling
off
the
road
into
the
bushes
something
garfield
added
mentally
that
found
fiery
automatic
destruction
when
death
came
to
it
so
that
its
secrets
would
remain
unrevealed
but
for
him
the
fire
meant
the
end
of
a
nightmare
he
rolled
the
window
up
took
out
a
cigarette
lit
it
and
pressed
the
accelerator
in
incredulous
fright
he
felt
the
nose
of
the
car
tilt
upwards
headlights
sweeping
up
from
the
road
into
the
trees
then
the
headlights
winked
out
beyond
the
windshield
dark
tree
branches
floated
down
towards
him
the
night
sky
beyond
he
reached
frantically
for
the
door
handle
a
steel
wrench
clamped
silently
about
each
of
his
arms
drawing
them
in
against
his
sides
immobilizing
them
there
garfield
gasped
looked
up
at
the
mirror
and
saw
a
pair
of
faintly
gleaming
red
eyes
watching
him
from
the
rear
of
the
car
two
of
the
things
the
second
one
stood
behind
him
out
of
sight
holding
him
they
been
in
what
had
seemed
to
be
the
trunk
compartment
and
they
had
come
out
the
eyes
in
the
mirror
vanished
a
moist
black
reached
over
the
back
of
the
seat
beside
garfield
picked
up
the
cigarette
he
had
dropped
extinguished
it
with
rather
horribly
human
motions
then
took
up
garfield
gun
and
drew
back
out
of
sight
he
expected
a
shot
but
none
came
one
does
fire
a
bullet
through
the
suit
one
intends
to
wear
it
was
until
that
thought
occurred
to
him
that
tough
phil
garfield
began
to
scream
he
was
still
screaming
minutes
later
when
beyond
the
windshield
the
spaceship
floated
into
view
among
the
stars
