it
was
ordained
that
shibli
bagarag
nephew
to
the
renowned
baba
mustapha
chief
barber
to
the
court
of
persia
should
shave
shagpat
the
son
of
shimpoor
the
son
of
shoolpi
the
son
of
shullum
and
they
had
been
clothiers
for
generations
even
to
the
time
of
shagpat
the
illustrious
now
the
story
of
shibli
bagarag
and
of
the
ball
he
followed
and
of
the
subterranean
kingdom
he
came
to
and
of
the
enchanted
palace
he
entered
and
of
the
sleeping
king
he
shaved
and
of
the
two
princesses
he
released
and
of
the
afrite
held
in
subjection
by
the
arts
of
one
and
bottled
by
her
is
it
not
known
as
written
on
the
of
men
and
traced
in
their
as
the
poet
says
ripe
with
oft
telling
and
old
is
the
tale
but
is
of
the
sort
that
can
never
grow
stale
now
things
were
in
that
condition
with
shibli
bagarag
that
on
a
certain
day
he
was
hungry
and
abject
and
the
city
of
shagpat
the
clothier
was
before
him
so
he
made
toward
it
deliberating
as
to
how
he
should
procure
a
meal
for
he
had
not
a
dirhem
in
his
girdle
and
the
remembrance
of
great
dishes
and
savoury
ingredients
were
to
him
as
the
illusion
of
rivers
sheening
on
the
sands
to
travellers
gasping
with
thirst
and
he
considered
his
case
crying
this
comes
of
wandering
and
the
curse
of
the
inquiring
spirit
for
in
shiraz
where
my
craft
is
in
favour
i
should
be
sitting
now
with
my
uncle
baba
mustapha
the
loquacious
one
partaking
of
seasoned
sweet
dishes
dipping
my
fingers
in
them
rejoicing
my
soul
with
scandal
of
the
court
now
he
came
to
a
knoll
of
sand
under
a
palm
from
which
the
yellow
domes
and
mosques
of
the
city
of
shagpat
and
its
black
cypresses
and
marble
palace
fronts
and
shining
pillars
and
lofty
carven
arches
that
spanned
of
the
hot
grey
sky
were
plainly
visible
then
gazed
he
awhile
despondingly
on
the
city
of
shagpat
and
groaned
in
contemplation
of
his
evil
plight
as
is
said
by
the
poet
the
curse
of
sorrow
is
comparison
as
the
sun
casteth
shade
night
showeth
star
we
measuring
what
we
were
by
what
we
are
behold
the
depth
to
which
we
are
undone
wherefore
he
counselleth
look
neither
too
much
up
nor
down
at
all
but
forward
stepping
strive
no
more
to
fall
and
the
advice
is
excellent
but
as
is
again
said
the
preacher
preacheth
and
the
hearer
heareth
but
comfort
first
each
function
requireth
and
to
a
hungry
stomach
is
thin
pottage
saith
the
shrewd
reader
of
men
little
comfort
was
there
with
shibli
bagarag
as
he
looked
on
the
city
of
shagpat
the
clothier
he
cried
aloud
that
his
evil
chance
had
got
the
better
of
him
and
rolled
his
body
in
the
sand
beating
his
breast
and
conjuring
up
images
of
the
profusion
of
dainties
and
the
abundance
of
provision
in
shiraz
exclaiming
and
woe
me
this
it
is
to
be
selected
for
the
diversion
of
him
that
plotteth
against
man
truly
is
it
written
on
different
heads
misfortunes
come
one
bears
them
firm
another
faints
while
this
one
hangs
them
like
a
drum
whereon
to
batter
loud
complaints
and
of
the
three
kinds
they
who
bang
the
drum
outnumber
the
silent
ones
as
do
the
billows
of
the
sea
the
ships
that
swim
or
the
grains
of
sand
the
trees
that
grow
a
noisy
multitude
now
he
was
in
the
pits
of
despondency
even
as
one
that
yieldeth
without
further
struggle
to
the
waves
of
tempest
at
midnight
when
he
was
ware
of
one
standing
over
him
a
woman
old
wrinkled
a
very
crone
with
but
room
for
the
drawing
of
a
thread
between
her
nose
and
her
chin
she
was
as
is
cited
of
them
who
betray
the
doings
of
time
wrinkled
at
the
rind
and
overripe
at
the
core
and
every
part
of
her
nodded
and
shook
like
a
tree
sapped
by
the
waters
and
her
joints
were
sharp
as
the
of
a
grasshopper
she
was
indeed
one
upon
the
rocks
of
time
now
when
the
old
woman
had
scanned
shibli
bagarag
she
called
to
him
thou
what
is
it
with
thee
that
thou
rollest
as
one
reft
of
his
wits
he
answered
her
bewail
my
condition
which
is
beggary
and
the
lack
of
that
which
filleth
with
pleasantness
so
the
old
woman
said
me
thy
case
he
answered
her
old
woman
surely
it
was
written
at
my
birth
that
i
should
take
ruin
from
the
readers
of
planets
now
they
proclaimed
that
i
was
one
day
destined
for
great
things
if
i
stood
by
my
tackle
i
a
barber
know
then
that
i
have
had
many
offers
and
bribes
seductive
ones
from
the
rich
and
the
exalted
in
rank
and
i
heeded
them
not
mindful
of
what
was
foretold
of
me
i
stood
by
my
tackle
as
a
warrior
standeth
by
his
arms
flourishing
them
now
when
i
found
great
things
came
not
to
me
and
was
the
continuance
of
sameness
and
satiety
with
baba
mustapha
my
uncle
in
shiraz
the
the
endless
tattler
surely
i
was
advised
by
the
words
of
the
poet
to
go
forth
in
search
of
what
was
wanting
and
he
says
thou
that
dreamest
an
event
while
circumstance
is
but
a
waste
of
sand
arise
take
up
thy
fortunes
in
thy
hand
and
daily
forward
pitch
thy
tent
now
i
passed
from
city
to
city
proclaiming
my
science
holding
aloft
my
tackle
wullahy
many
adventures
were
mine
and
if
there
some
day
propitiousness
in
fortune
o
old
woman
i
tell
thee
of
what
befell
me
in
the
kingdom
of
shah
shamshureen
is
wondrous
a
matter
to
draw
down
the
lower
jaw
with
amazement
now
so
it
was
that
in
the
eyes
of
one
city
i
was
honoured
and
in
request
by
reason
of
my
calling
and
i
fared
sumptuously
even
as
a
great
officer
of
state
surrounded
by
slaves
lounging
upon
clouds
of
silk
stuffs
circled
by
attentive
ears
in
another
city
there
was
no
beast
so
base
as
wah
i
was
one
hunted
of
men
and
an
abomination
no
housing
for
me
nought
to
operate
upon
i
was
the
lean
dog
that
lieth
in
wait
for
offal
it
seemeth
certain
o
old
woman
that
a
curse
hath
fallen
on
barbercraft
in
these
days
because
of
the
identical
whose
might
i
know
not
everywhere
it
is
growing
in
disrepute
is
languishing
nevertheless
till
now
i
have
preserved
my
tackle
and
i
would
descend
on
yonder
city
to
exercise
it
even
for
a
livelihood
forgetting
awhile
great
things
but
that
i
dread
men
may
have
changed
there
also
and
there
no
stability
in
them
i
call
allah
whose
name
be
praised
to
witness
so
should
i
be
a
thing
unsightly
subject
to
hateful
castigation
wherefore
is
it
that
i
am
in
that
state
described
by
the
poet
when
dreading
retreat
dreading
advance
to
make
round
we
revolve
like
to
the
wounded
snake
is
not
my
case
now
a
piteous
one
one
that
toucheth
the
tender
corner
in
man
and
woman
when
she
that
listened
had
heard
him
to
an
end
she
shook
her
garments
crying
youth
son
of
my
uncle
be
comforted
for
if
it
is
as
i
think
the
readers
of
planets
were
right
and
thou
art
thus
early
within
reach
of
great
things
nigh
grasping
them
then
she
fell
to
mumbling
and
reciting
jigs
of
verse
quaint
measures
and
she
pored
along
the
sand
to
where
a
line
had
been
drawn
and
saw
that
the
footprints
of
the
youth
were
traced
along
it
lo
at
that
sight
she
clapped
her
hands
joyfully
and
ran
up
to
the
youth
and
peered
in
his
face
exclaiming
things
indeed
and
praise
thou
the
readers
of
planets
o
nephew
of
the
barber
they
that
sent
thee
searching
the
event
thou
art
to
master
wullahy
have
i
not
half
a
mind
to
call
thee
already
master
of
the
event
then
she
abated
somewhat
in
her
liveliness
and
said
to
him
that
the
city
thou
seest
is
the
city
of
shagpat
the
clothier
and
there
no
one
living
on
the
face
of
earth
nor
a
soul
that
requireth
thy
craft
more
than
he
go
therefore
thou
bold
of
heart
brisk
full
of
the
sprightliness
of
the
barber
and
enter
to
him
lo
see
him
lolling
in
his
to
be
admired
of
this
people
marvelled
at
oh
no
mistaking
of
shagpat
and
the
mole
might
discern
shagpat
among
myriads
of
our
kind
and
enter
thou
to
him
gaily
as
to
perform
a
friendly
office
one
meriting
thanks
and
gratulations
saying
will
preserve
thee
the
identical
now
he
at
first
feign
not
to
understand
thee
dense
of
wit
that
he
is
but
mince
not
matters
with
him
perform
well
thy
operation
and
thou
wilt
come
to
great
things
what
say
i
is
certain
that
when
thou
hast
shaved
shagpat
thou
wilt
have
achieved
the
greatest
of
things
and
be
most
noteworthy
of
thy
race
thou
shibli
bagarag
even
thou
and
thou
wilt
be
master
of
the
event
so
named
in
anecdotes
and
histories
and
records
to
all
succeeding
generations
at
her
words
the
breast
of
shibli
bagarag
took
in
a
great
wind
and
he
hung
his
head
a
moment
to
ponder
them
and
he
thought
provokingness
in
the
speech
of
this
old
woman
and
she
one
that
instigateth
keenly
she
called
me
by
my
name
heard
i
that
is
a
mystery
and
he
thought
she
is
a
genie
one
of
an
ill
tribe
and
she
luring
me
to
my
perdition
in
this
city
how
if
that
be
so
and
again
he
thought
can
not
be
she
probably
the
genie
that
presided
over
my
birth
and
promised
me
dower
of
great
things
through
the
mouths
of
the
readers
of
planets
now
when
shibli
bagarag
had
so
deliberated
he
lifted
his
sight
and
lo
the
old
woman
was
no
longer
before
him
he
stared
and
rubbed
his
eyes
but
she
was
clean
gone
then
ran
he
to
the
knolls
and
eminences
that
were
scattered
about
to
command
a
view
but
she
was
nowhere
visible
so
he
thought
a
dream
and
he
was
composing
himself
to
despair
upon
the
scant
herbage
of
one
of
those
knolls
when
as
he
chanced
to
gaze
down
the
city
below
he
saw
there
a
commotion
and
a
crowd
of
people
flocking
one
way
he
thought
surely
no
dream
come
not
genii
and
go
they
not
in
the
fashion
of
that
old
woman
i
even
descend
on
yonder
city
and
try
my
tackle
on
shagpat
inquiring
for
him
and
if
he
is
there
i
shall
know
i
have
had
to
do
with
a
potent
spirit
allah
protect
me
so
having
shut
together
the
clasps
of
resolve
he
arose
and
made
for
the
gates
of
the
city
and
entered
it
by
the
principal
entrance
it
was
a
fair
city
the
fairest
and
chief
of
that
country
prosperous
powerful
a
mart
for
numerous
commodities
handicrafts
wares
round
it
a
wild
country
and
a
waste
of
sand
ruled
by
the
lion
in
his
wrath
and
in
it
the
tiger
the
camelopard
the
antelope
and
other
animals
hither
in
caravans
came
the
people
of
oolb
and
the
people
of
damascus
and
the
people
of
vatz
and
they
of
bagdad
and
the
ringheez
great
traders
and
others
trading
and
there
was
constant
flow
of
intercourse
between
them
and
the
city
of
shagpat
now
as
shibli
bagarag
paced
up
one
of
the
streets
of
the
city
he
beheld
a
multitude
in
procession
following
one
that
was
crowned
after
the
manner
of
kings
with
a
glittering
crown
clad
in
the
yellow
girdled
robes
and
he
sporting
a
fine
profusion
of
hair
unequalled
by
all
around
him
save
by
one
that
was
a
little
behind
shadowed
by
his
presence
so
shibli
bagarag
thought
one
of
this
twain
shagpat
for
never
till
now
have
i
seen
such
rare
growths
and
indeed
a
bliss
to
slip
the
blade
between
them
and
those
masses
of
darkness
that
hang
from
them
then
he
stepped
before
the
king
and
made
himself
prominent
in
his
path
humbling
himself
and
it
was
as
he
anticipated
the
king
prevented
his
removal
by
the
slaves
that
would
have
dragged
him
away
and
desired
a
hearing
as
to
his
business
and
what
brought
him
to
the
city
a
stranger
thereupon
shibli
bagarag
prostrated
himself
and
cried
great
king
sovereign
of
the
time
surely
i
am
one
to
be
looked
on
with
the
eye
of
grace
and
i
am
nephew
to
baba
mustapha
renowned
in
shiraz
a
barber
i
a
barber
and
it
is
my
prayer
o
king
of
the
age
that
thou
take
me
under
thy
protection
and
the
shield
of
thy
fair
will
while
i
perform
good
work
in
this
city
by
operating
on
the
unshorn
when
he
had
spoken
the
king
made
a
point
of
his
eyebrows
and
exclaimed
so
they
hold
out
against
shagpat
yet
aha
shiraz
that
nest
of
them
that
reptile
nest
then
he
turned
to
his
vizier
beside
him
and
said
shall
be
done
with
this
fellow
so
the
vizier
replied
well
o
king
he
be
summoned
to
a
sense
of
the
loathsomeness
of
his
craft
by
the
agency
of
fifty
stripes
the
king
said
commanded
then
he
passed
forward
in
his
majesty
and
shibli
bagarag
was
ware
of
the
power
of
five
slaves
upon
him
and
he
was
hurried
at
a
quick
pace
through
the
streets
and
before
the
eyes
of
the
people
even
to
the
common
receptacle
of
felons
and
there
received
from
each
slave
severally
ten
thwacks
with
a
thong
is
certain
that
at
every
thwack
the
thong
took
an
airing
before
it
descended
upon
him
then
loosed
they
him
to
wander
whither
he
listed
and
disgust
was
strong
in
him
by
reason
of
the
disgrace
and
the
severity
of
the
administration
of
the
blows
he
strayed
along
the
streets
in
wretchedness
and
hunger
increased
on
him
assailing
him
first
as
a
wolf
in
his
vitals
then
as
it
had
been
a
chasm
yawning
betwixt
his
trunk
and
his
lower
members
and
he
thought
have
been
long
in
chase
of
great
things
and
the
hope
of
attaining
them
is
great
yet
wullahy
would
i
barter
all
for
one
refreshing
meal
and
the
sense
of
fulness
is
so
and
sad
is
it
and
he
was
mindful
of
the
words
who
seeks
the
shadow
to
the
substance
sinneth
and
daily
craving
what
is
not
he
thinneth
his
lean
ambition
how
shall
he
attain
for
with
this
constant
foolishness
he
doeth
he
waxing
liker
to
what
he
pursueth
himself
becometh
what
he
chased
in
vain
and
again
of
honour
half
my
fellows
boast
a
thing
that
scorns
and
kills
us
methinks
that
honours
us
the
most
which
nourishes
and
fills
us
so
he
thought
he
would
of
a
surety
fling
far
away
his
tackle
discard
barbercraft
and
be
as
other
men
a
mortal
forgotten
with
his
generation
and
he
cried
aloud
thou
old
woman
thou
deceiver
what
halt
thou
obtained
for
me
by
thy
deceits
and
why
put
i
faith
in
thee
to
the
purchase
of
a
thwacking
woe
me
i
would
thou
hadst
been
but
a
dream
thou
crone
thou
guileful
parcel
of
belabouring
bones
now
while
he
lounged
and
strolled
and
was
abusing
the
old
woman
he
looked
before
him
and
lo
one
lolling
in
his
and
people
standing
outside
the
shop
marking
him
with
admiration
and
reverence
and
pointing
him
out
to
each
other
with
approving
gestures
he
who
lolled
there
was
indeed
a
miracle
of
hairiness
black
with
hair
as
he
had
been
muzzled
with
it
and
his
head
as
it
were
a
berry
in
a
bush
by
reason
of
it
then
thought
shibli
bagarag
shagpat
if
the
mole
could
swear
to
him
surely
can
i
so
he
regarded
the
clothier
and
there
was
naught
seen
on
earth
like
the
gravity
of
shagpat
as
he
lolled
before
those
people
that
failed
not
to
assemble
in
groups
and
gaze
at
him
he
was
as
a
sleepy
lion
cased
in
his
mane
as
an
owl
drowsy
in
the
daylight
now
would
he
close
an
eye
or
move
two
fingers
but
of
other
motion
made
he
none
yet
the
people
gazed
at
him
with
eagerness
shibli
bagarag
was
astonished
at
them
thinking
hair
there
is
might
in
hair
but
there
is
greater
might
in
the
barber
nevertheless
here
the
barber
is
scorned
the
grower
of
crops
held
in
amazing
reverence
then
thought
he
truly
wondrous
the
crop
he
groweth
not
even
king
shamshureen
after
a
thousand
years
sported
such
mighty
profusion
him
i
sheared
it
was
a
high
task
why
not
this
shagpat
now
long
gazing
on
shagpat
awoke
in
shibli
bagarag
fierce
desire
to
shear
him
and
it
was
scarce
in
his
power
to
restrain
himself
from
flying
at
the
clothier
he
saying
obstacle
now
what
protecteth
him
nay
why
not
trust
to
the
old
woman
said
she
not
i
should
first
essay
on
shagpat
and
was
my
folly
in
appealing
to
the
king
that
brought
on
me
that
thwacking
is
well
i
trust
to
her
words
wullahy
will
it
not
lead
me
to
great
things
so
it
was
that
as
he
thought
this
he
continued
to
keep
eye
on
shagpat
and
the
hunger
that
was
in
him
passed
and
became
a
ravenous
vulture
that
flew
from
him
and
singled
forth
shagpat
as
prey
and
there
was
no
help
for
it
but
in
he
must
go
and
state
his
case
to
shagpat
and
essay
shearing
him
now
when
he
was
in
the
presence
he
exclaimed
o
vendor
of
apparel
unto
thee
and
unto
thine
shagpat
answered
with
thee
said
shibli
bagarag
have
heard
of
thee
o
thou
wonder
wullahy
i
am
here
to
render
homage
to
that
i
behold
shagpat
answered
well
then
said
shibli
bagarag
my
discretion
i
have
even
this
day
entered
the
city
and
it
is
to
thee
i
offer
the
first
shave
o
tangle
of
glory
at
these
words
shagpat
darkened
saying
gruffly
jest
is
offensive
and
it
is
unseasonable
for
staleness
and
lack
of
holiness
but
shibli
bagarag
cried
jest
o
purveyor
to
the
outward
of
us
but
a
very
excellent
earnest
thereat
the
face
of
shagpat
was
as
an
exceeding
red
berry
in
a
bush
and
he
said
angrily
done
no
more
of
it
or
haply
my
spleen
will
be
awakened
and
that
of
them
who
see
with
more
eyes
than
two
nevertheless
shibli
bagarag
urged
him
and
he
winked
and
gesticulated
and
pointed
to
his
head
crying
not
o
man
of
the
nicety
of
measure
into
the
trap
of
error
for
is
i
that
am
a
barber
and
a
rarity
in
this
city
even
shibli
bagarag
of
shiraz
know
me
nephew
of
the
renowned
baba
mustapha
chief
barber
to
the
court
of
persia
languishest
thou
not
for
my
art
lo
with
three
sweeps
i
give
thee
a
clean
poll
all
save
the
identical
and
i
can
discern
and
save
it
fear
me
not
nor
distrust
my
skill
and
the
cunning
that
is
mine
when
he
had
heard
shibli
bagarag
to
a
close
the
countenance
of
shagpat
waxed
fiery
as
it
had
been
flame
kindled
by
travellers
at
night
in
a
thorny
and
he
ruffled
and
heaved
and
was
as
when
dense
are
stirred
violently
by
the
near
approach
of
a
wild
animal
in
his
fury
shouting
in
short
breaths
barber
a
barber
so
can
it
be
to
me
a
barber
o
thou
thou
reptile
filthy
thing
a
barber
o
dog
a
barber
what
when
i
bid
fair
for
the
highest
honours
known
o
sacrilegious
wretch
monster
how
are
the
afrites
jealous
that
they
send
thee
to
jibe
me
thereupon
he
set
up
a
cry
for
his
wife
and
that
woman
rushed
to
him
from
an
inner
room
and
fell
upon
shibli
bagarag
belabouring
him
so
when
she
was
weary
of
this
she
said
light
of
my
eyes
o
golden
crop
and
adorable
man
what
hath
he
done
to
thee
shagpat
answered
a
barber
and
he
hath
sworn
to
shave
me
and
leave
me
not
save
shorn
hardly
had
shagpat
spoken
this
when
she
became
limp
with
the
hearing
of
it
then
shibli
bagarag
slunk
from
the
shop
but
without
the
crowd
had
increased
seeing
an
altercation
and
as
he
took
to
his
heels
they
followed
him
and
there
was
uproar
in
the
streets
of
the
city
and
in
the
air
above
them
as
of
raging
genii
he
like
a
started
quarry
doubling
this
way
and
that
and
at
the
corners
of
streets
and
open
places
speeding
on
till
there
was
no
breath
in
his
body
the
cry
still
after
him
that
he
had
bearded
shagpat
at
last
they
came
up
with
him
and
belaboured
him
each
and
all
it
was
a
storm
of
thwacks
that
fell
on
the
back
of
shibli
bagarag
when
they
had
wearied
themselves
in
this
fashion
they
took
him
as
had
he
been
a
stray
bundle
or
a
damaged
bale
and
hurled
him
from
the
gates
of
the
city
into
the
wilderness
once
more
now
when
he
was
alone
he
staggered
awhile
and
then
flung
himself
to
the
earth
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
nor
above
all
he
could
think
was
accursed
old
woman
and
this
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
for
solace
as
the
poet
says
is
sure
the
special
privilege
of
hate
to
curse
the
authors
of
our
evil
state
as
he
was
thus
complaining
behold
the
very
old
woman
before
him
and
she
wheezed
and
croaked
and
coughed
and
shook
herself
and
screwed
her
face
into
a
pleasing
pucker
and
assumed
womanish
airs
and
swayed
herself
like
as
do
the
full
moons
of
the
harem
when
the
eye
of
the
master
is
upon
them
having
made
an
end
of
these
prettinesses
she
said
in
a
tone
of
soft
insinuation
youth
nephew
of
the
barber
look
upon
me
shibli
bagarag
knew
her
voice
and
he
would
not
look
thinking
what
a
dreadful
old
woman
is
this
just
calling
on
her
name
in
detestation
maketh
her
present
to
us
so
the
old
woman
seeing
him
resolute
to
shun
her
leaned
to
him
and
put
one
hand
to
her
dress
and
squatted
beside
him
and
said
youth
thou
hast
been
thwacked
he
groaned
lifting
not
his
face
nor
saying
aught
then
said
she
thou
truly
in
search
of
great
things
o
youth
still
he
groaned
answering
no
syllable
and
she
continued
surely
in
sweet
friendliness
i
ask
art
thou
not
a
fair
youth
one
to
entice
a
damsel
to
perfect
friendliness
louder
yet
did
he
groan
at
her
words
thinking
damsel
verily
so
the
old
woman
said
wot
thou
art
angry
with
me
but
now
look
up
o
nephew
of
the
barber
no
time
for
vexation
what
says
the
poet
cares
the
warrior
for
his
wounds
when
the
steed
in
battle
bounds
moreover
let
him
who
grasps
the
crown
strip
not
for
shame
lest
he
expose
what
gain
it
blow
and
maim
so
be
it
with
thee
and
thy
thwacking
o
foolish
youth
hide
it
from
thyself
thou
silly
one
what
thou
hast
been
thwacked
and
refusest
the
fruit
of
it
which
is
resoluteness
strength
of
mind
sternness
in
pursuit
of
the
object
then
she
softened
her
tone
to
persuasiveness
saying
written
i
should
be
the
head
of
thy
fortune
o
shibli
bagarag
and
be
enviable
among
men
by
my
aid
so
look
upon
me
and
for
i
know
thee
famished
thou
shah
presently
be
supplied
with
viands
and
bright
wines
and
sweetmeats
delicacies
to
cheer
thee
now
the
promise
of
food
and
provision
was
powerful
with
shibli
bagarag
and
he
looked
up
gloomily
and
the
old
woman
smiled
archly
at
him
and
wriggled
in
her
seat
like
a
dusty
worm
and
said
thou
find
me
charming
thou
fair
youth
he
was
nigh
laughing
in
her
face
but
restrained
himself
to
reply
art
that
thou
art
said
she
so
but
that
i
shall
be
then
she
said
youth
pay
me
now
a
compliment
shibli
bagarag
was
at
a
loss
what
further
to
say
to
the
old
woman
for
his
heart
cursed
her
for
her
persecutions
and
ridiculed
her
for
her
vanities
at
last
he
bethought
himself
of
the
saying
of
the
poet
truly
the
offspring
of
fine
wit
where
he
says
expect
no
flatteries
from
me
while
i
am
empty
of
good
things
i
call
thee
fair
and
i
agree
thou
boldest
love
in
silken
strings
when
thou
bast
primed
me
from
thy
plenteous
store
but
oh
till
then
a
clod
am
i
no
seed
within
to
throw
up
flowers
all
drouthy
to
the
fountain
dry
to
empty
stomachs
nature
lowers
the
lake
was
full
where
heaven
look
fair
of
yore
so
when
he
had
spoken
that
the
old
woman
laughed
and
exclaimed
art
apt
it
is
well
said
surely
i
excuse
thee
till
that
time
now
listen
is
written
we
work
together
and
i
know
it
by
divination
have
i
not
known
thee
wandering
and
on
thy
way
to
this
city
of
shagpat
where
some
day
sit
throned
now
i
propose
to
thee
this
and
is
an
excellent
proposal
that
i
lead
thee
to
great
things
and
make
thee
glorious
a
sitter
in
high
seats
master
of
an
event
cried
he
proposal
honourable
to
thee
and
pleasant
in
the
ear
she
added
thou
marry
me
in
sweet
marriage
thereat
he
stared
on
vacancy
with
a
serious
eye
and
he
could
scarce
credit
her
earnestness
but
she
repeated
the
same
so
presently
he
thought
old
hag
appeareth
deep
in
the
fountain
of
events
and
she
will
be
a
right
arm
to
me
in
the
mastering
of
one
a
torch
in
darkness
seeing
there
is
wisdom
in
her
as
well
as
wickedness
the
thwackings
sad
was
their
taste
but
they
in
the
road
leading
to
greatness
and
i
can
not
say
she
put
me
out
of
that
road
in
putting
me
where
they
were
her
age
shall
i
complain
of
that
when
it
is
a
sign
she
goeth
shortly
altogether
as
he
was
thus
debating
he
regarded
the
old
woman
stealthily
and
she
was
in
agitation
so
that
her
joints
creaked
like
forest
branches
in
a
wind
and
the
puckers
of
her
visage
moved
as
do
billows
of
the
sea
to
and
fro
and
the
anticipations
of
a
fair
young
bride
are
not
more
eager
than
what
was
visible
in
the
old
woman
wheedlingly
she
looked
at
him
and
shaped
her
mouth
like
a
bird
bill
to
soften
it
and
she
drew
together
her
dress
to
give
herself
the
look
of
slimness
using
all
fascinations
he
thought
a
wondrous
old
woman
marriage
would
seem
a
thing
of
moment
to
her
yet
is
the
profit
with
me
and
i
agree
to
it
so
he
said
a
pact
between
us
o
old
woman
now
the
eyes
of
the
old
woman
brightened
when
she
heard
him
and
were
as
the
eyes
of
a
falcon
that
eyeth
game
hungry
with
red
fire
and
she
looked
brisk
with
impatience
laughing
a
low
laugh
and
saying
youth
i
must
claim
of
thee
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
the
kiss
of
contract
so
shibli
bagarag
was
mindful
of
what
is
written
if
thou
wouldst
take
the
great
leap
be
ready
for
the
little
jump
and
he
stretched
out
his
mouth
to
the
forehead
of
the
old
woman
when
he
had
done
so
it
was
as
though
she
had
been
illuminated
as
when
light
is
put
in
the
hollow
of
a
pumpkin
then
said
she
is
well
this
is
a
fair
beginning
now
look
for
thy
fortune
will
of
a
surety
follow
call
me
now
sweet
bride
and
knocker
at
the
threshold
of
hearts
so
shibli
bagarag
sighed
and
called
her
this
and
he
said
not
my
condition
o
old
woman
and
that
i
am
nigh
famished
upon
that
she
nodded
gravely
and
arose
and
shook
her
garments
together
and
beckoned
for
shibli
bagarag
to
follow
her
and
the
two
passed
through
the
gates
of
the
city
and
held
on
together
through
divers
streets
and
thoroughfares
till
they
came
before
the
doors
of
a
palace
with
a
pillared
entrance
and
the
old
woman
passed
through
the
doors
of
the
palace
as
one
familiar
to
them
and
lo
they
were
in
a
lofty
court
built
all
of
marble
and
in
the
middle
of
it
a
fountain
playing
splashing
silvery
shibli
bagarag
would
have
halted
here
to
breathe
the
cool
refreshingness
of
the
air
but
the
old
woman
would
not
and
she
hurried
on
even
to
the
opening
of
a
spacious
hall
and
in
it
slaves
in
circle
round
a
raised
seat
where
sat
one
that
was
their
lord
and
it
was
the
chief
vizier
of
the
king
then
the
old
woman
turned
round
sharply
to
shibli
bagarag
and
said
of
thy
tackle
o
my
betrothed
he
answered
edge
is
keen
the
hand
ready
then
said
she
well
so
the
old
woman
put
her
two
hands
on
the
shoulders
of
shibli
bagarag
saying
thy
reverence
to
him
on
the
raised
seat
have
faith
in
thy
tackle
and
in
me
renounce
not
either
whatsoever
ensueth
be
not
abashed
o
my
bridegroom
to
be
thereupon
she
thrust
him
in
and
shibli
bagarag
was
abashed
and
played
foolishly
with
his
fingers
knowing
not
what
to
do
so
when
the
chief
vizier
saw
him
he
cried
out
art
thou
and
what
wantest
thou
now
the
back
of
shibli
bagarag
tingled
when
he
heard
the
vizier
voice
and
he
said
am
o
man
of
exalted
condition
he
whom
men
know
as
shibli
bagarag
nephew
to
baba
mustapha
the
renowned
of
shiraz
myself
barber
likewise
proud
of
my
art
prepared
to
exercise
it
then
said
the
chief
vizier
even
to
our
faces
wonderful
is
the
audacity
of
impudence
know
o
nephew
of
the
barber
thou
art
among
them
that
honour
not
thy
art
is
it
not
written
for
one
thing
thou
shaft
be
crowned
here
for
that
thing
be
thwacked
there
so
also
it
is
written
the
tongue
of
the
insolent
one
is
a
lash
and
a
perpetual
castigation
to
him
and
it
is
written
o
shibli
bagarag
that
i
reap
honour
from
thee
and
there
is
no
help
but
that
thou
be
made
an
example
of
so
the
chief
vizier
uttered
command
and
shibli
bagarag
was
ware
of
the
power
of
five
slaves
upon
him
and
they
seized
him
familiarly
and
placed
him
in
position
and
made
ready
his
clothing
for
the
reception
of
fifty
other
thwacks
with
a
thong
each
several
thwack
coming
down
on
him
with
a
hiss
as
it
were
a
serpent
and
with
a
smack
as
it
were
the
mouth
of
satisfaction
and
the
people
assembled
extolled
the
chief
vizier
saying
and
valiantly
done
o
stay
of
the
state
and
to
the
accursed
race
of
barbers
now
when
they
had
passed
before
the
chief
vizier
and
departed
lo
he
fell
to
laughing
violently
so
that
his
hair
was
agitated
and
was
as
a
over
him
and
his
countenance
behind
it
was
as
the
sun
of
the
desert
reflected
ripplingly
on
the
waters
of
a
bubbling
spring
for
it
had
the
aspect
of
merriness
and
the
chief
vizier
exclaimed
shibli
bagarag
have
i
not
made
fair
show
and
shibli
bagarag
said
fair
show
o
mighty
one
yet
knew
he
not
in
what
but
he
was
abject
by
reason
of
the
thwacks
so
the
vizier
said
lookest
lean
even
as
one
to
whom
fortune
oweth
a
long
debt
tell
me
now
of
thy
barbercraft
perchance
thy
gain
will
be
great
thereby
and
shibli
bagarag
answered
gain
has
been
great
o
eminent
in
rank
but
of
evil
quality
and
i
am
content
not
to
increase
it
and
he
broke
forth
into
lamentations
crying
in
excellent
verse
why
am
i
thus
the
sport
of
all
a
thing
fate
knocketh
like
a
ball
from
point
to
point
of
evil
chance
even
as
the
sneer
of
circumstance
while
thirsting
for
the
highest
fame
i
hunger
like
the
lowest
beast
to
be
the
first
of
men
i
aim
and
find
myself
the
least
now
the
vizier
delayed
not
when
he
heard
this
to
have
a
fair
supply
set
before
shibli
bagarag
and
meats
dressed
in
divers
fashions
spiced
and
coloured
and
with
herbs
and
wines
in
golden
goblets
and
slaves
in
attendance
so
shibli
bagarag
ate
and
drank
and
presently
his
soul
arose
from
its
prostration
and
he
cried
the
head
cook
of
king
shamshureen
could
have
worked
no
better
as
regards
the
restorative
process
then
said
the
chief
vizier
shibli
bagarag
where
now
is
thy
tackle
and
shibli
bagarag
winked
and
nodded
and
turned
his
head
in
the
manner
of
the
knowing
ones
and
he
recited
the
verse
is
well
that
we
are
sometimes
circumspect
and
hold
ourselves
in
witless
ways
deterred
one
thwacking
made
me
seriously
reflect
a
second
turned
the
cream
of
love
to
curd
most
surely
that
profession
i
reject
before
the
fear
of
a
prospective
third
so
the
vizier
said
well
thou
turnest
verse
neatly
and
he
exclaimed
extemporaneously
if
thou
wouldst
have
thy
achievement
as
high
as
the
wings
of
ambition
can
fly
if
thou
the
clear
summit
of
hope
wouldst
attain
and
not
have
thy
labour
in
vain
be
steadfast
in
that
which
impell
for
the
peace
of
earth
he
who
leaves
must
have
trust
he
is
safe
while
he
soars
but
when
faith
shall
cease
desponding
he
drops
to
the
dust
then
said
he
no
further
thwacking
but
honour
and
prosperity
in
the
place
of
it
what
says
the
poet
we
faint
when
for
the
fire
there
needs
one
spark
we
droop
when
our
desire
is
near
its
mark
how
near
to
it
art
thou
o
shibli
bagarag
know
then
that
among
this
people
there
is
great
reverence
for
the
growing
of
hair
and
he
that
is
hairiest
is
honoured
most
wherefore
are
barbers
creatures
of
especial
abhorrence
and
of
a
surety
flourish
not
and
so
it
is
that
i
owe
my
station
to
the
esteem
i
profess
for
the
cultivation
of
hair
and
to
my
persecution
of
the
clippers
of
it
and
in
this
kingdom
is
no
one
that
beareth
such
a
crop
as
i
saving
one
a
clothier
an
accursed
one
and
may
a
blight
fall
upon
him
for
his
vanity
and
his
affectation
of
solemn
priestliness
and
his
lolling
in
his
to
be
admired
and
marvelled
at
by
the
people
so
this
fellow
i
would
disgrace
and
bring
to
scorn
this
shagpat
for
he
is
mine
enemy
and
the
eye
of
the
king
my
master
is
on
him
now
i
conceive
thy
assistance
in
this
matter
shibli
bagarag
thou
a
barber
when
shibli
bagarag
heard
mention
of
shagpat
and
the
desire
for
vengeance
in
the
vizier
he
was
as
a
new
man
and
he
smelt
the
sweetness
of
his
own
revenge
as
a
vulture
smelleth
the
carrion
from
afar
and
he
said
am
thy
servant
thy
slave
o
vizier
then
smiled
he
as
to
his
own
soul
and
he
exclaimed
my
head
be
it
and
it
was
to
him
as
when
sudden
gusts
of
perfume
from
garden
roses
of
the
valley
meet
the
traveller
nostril
on
the
hill
that
overlooketh
the
valley
filling
him
with
ecstasy
and
newness
of
life
delicate
visions
and
he
cried
this
is
fair
this
is
well
i
am
he
that
was
appointed
to
do
thy
work
o
man
in
office
what
says
the
poet
the
destined
hand
doth
strike
the
fated
blow
surely
the
arrow
fitted
to
the
bow
and
he
says
the
feathered
seed
for
the
wind
delayeth
the
wind
above
the
garden
swayeth
the
garden
of
its
burden
knoweth
the
burden
falleth
sinketh
soweth
so
the
vizier
chuckled
and
nodded
saying
right
aptly
spoken
o
youth
of
favour
is
even
so
and
there
is
wisdom
in
what
is
written
chance
is
a
poor
knave
its
own
sad
slave
two
meet
that
were
to
meet
life
no
cheat
upon
that
he
cried
let
us
have
with
us
the
eclipser
of
reason
and
take
counsel
with
her
as
is
my
custom
now
the
vizier
made
signal
to
a
slave
in
attendance
and
the
slave
departed
from
the
hall
and
the
vizier
led
shibli
bagarag
into
a
closer
chamber
which
had
a
smooth
floor
of
inlaid
silver
and
silken
hangings
the
windows
looking
forth
on
the
gardens
of
the
palace
and
its
fountains
and
cool
recesses
of
shade
and
temperate
sweetness
while
they
sat
there
conversing
in
this
metre
and
that
measuring
quotations
lo
the
old
woman
the
affianced
of
shibli
bagarag
and
she
sumptuously
arrayed
in
perfect
queenliness
her
head
bound
in
a
circlet
of
gems
and
gold
her
figure
lustrous
with
a
full
robe
of
flowing
crimson
silk
and
she
wore
slippers
embroidered
with
golden
traceries
and
round
her
waist
a
girdle
flashing
with
jewels
so
that
to
look
on
she
was
as
a
long
falling
water
in
the
last
bright
slant
of
the
sun
her
hair
hung
disarranged
and
spread
in
a
scattered
fashion
off
her
shoulders
and
she
was
younger
by
many
moons
her
brow
smooth
where
shibli
bagarag
had
given
the
kiss
of
contract
her
hand
soft
and
white
where
he
had
taken
it
shibli
bagarag
was
smitten
with
astonishment
at
sight
of
her
and
he
thought
the
aspect
of
this
old
woman
would
realise
the
story
of
bhanavar
the
beautiful
and
it
is
a
story
marvellous
to
think
of
yet
how
great
is
the
likeness
between
bhanavar
and
this
old
woman
that
groweth
younger
and
he
thought
again
if
the
story
of
bhanavar
be
a
true
one
this
old
woman
such
as
she
no
other
so
while
he
considered
her
the
vizier
exclaimed
she
not
fair
my
daughter
and
the
youth
answered
is
o
vizier
that
she
is
but
the
vizier
cried
by
allah
she
is
that
she
will
be
and
the
vizier
said
she
that
is
my
daughter
tell
me
thy
thought
of
her
as
thou
thinkest
it
and
shibli
bagarag
replied
vizier
my
thought
of
her
is
she
seemeth
indeed
as
bhanavar
the
beautiful
no
other
then
the
vizier
and
the
eclipser
of
reason
exclaimed
together
of
bhanavar
and
her
story
o
youth
we
listen
so
shibli
bagarag
leaned
slightly
on
a
cushion
of
a
couch
and
narrated
as
followeth
and
this
is
the
story
of
bhanavar
the
beautiful
know
that
at
the
foot
of
a
lofty
mountain
of
the
caucasus
there
lieth
a
deep
blue
lake
near
to
this
lake
a
nest
of
serpents
wise
and
ancient
now
it
was
the
habit
of
a
damsel
to
pass
by
the
lake
early
at
morn
on
her
way
from
the
tents
of
her
tribe
to
the
pastures
of
the
flocks
as
she
pressed
the
white
arch
of
her
feet
on
the
soft
grasses
by
the
shore
of
the
lake
she
would
let
loose
her
hair
looking
over
into
the
water
and
bind
the
braid
again
round
her
temples
and
behind
her
ears
as
it
had
been
in
a
lucent
mirror
so
doing
she
would
laugh
her
laughter
was
like
the
falls
of
water
at
moonrise
her
loveliness
like
the
very
moonrise
and
she
was
stately
as
a
standing
before
the
moon
this
was
bhanavar
the
beautiful
now
the
damsel
was
betrothed
to
the
son
of
a
neighbouring
emir
a
youth
comely
skilled
with
the
bow
apt
in
all
exercises
one
that
sat
his
mare
firm
as
the
trained
falcon
that
fixeth
on
the
plunging
bull
of
the
plains
fair
and
terrible
in
combat
as
the
lightning
that
strideth
the
rolling
storm
and
it
is
sung
by
the
poet
when
on
his
desert
mare
i
see
my
prince
of
men
i
think
him
then
as
high
above
humanity
as
he
shines
radiant
over
me
lo
like
a
torrent
he
doth
bound
breasting
the
shock
from
rock
to
rock
a
pillar
of
storm
he
shakes
the
ground
his
turban
on
his
temples
wound
match
me
for
worth
to
be
adored
a
youth
like
him
in
heart
and
limb
swift
as
his
anger
is
his
sword
softer
than
woman
his
true
word
now
the
love
of
this
youth
for
the
damsel
bhanavar
was
a
consuming
passion
and
the
father
of
the
damsel
and
the
father
of
the
youth
looked
fairly
on
the
prospect
of
their
union
which
was
near
and
was
plighted
as
the
union
of
the
two
tribes
so
they
met
and
there
was
no
voice
against
their
meeting
and
all
the
love
that
was
in
them
they
were
free
to
pour
forth
far
from
the
hearing
of
men
even
where
they
would
before
the
rising
of
the
sun
and
ere
his
setting
the
youth
rode
swiftly
from
the
green
tents
of
the
emir
his
father
to
waylay
her
by
the
waters
of
the
lake
and
bhanavar
was
there
bending
over
the
lake
her
image
in
the
lake
glowing
like
the
fair
fulness
of
the
moon
and
the
youth
leaned
to
her
from
his
steed
and
sang
to
her
verses
of
her
great
loveliness
ere
she
was
wistful
of
him
then
she
turned
to
him
and
laughed
lightly
a
welcome
of
sweetness
and
shook
the
falls
of
her
hair
across
the
blushes
of
her
face
and
her
bosom
and
he
folded
her
to
him
and
those
two
would
fondle
together
in
the
fashion
of
the
betrothed
ones
the
blessing
of
allah
be
on
them
all
gazing
on
each
other
till
their
eyes
swam
with
tears
and
they
were
nigh
swooning
with
the
fulness
of
their
bliss
surely
was
an
innocent
and
tender
dalliance
and
their
prattle
was
that
of
lovers
till
the
time
of
parting
he
showing
her
how
she
looked
best
she
him
and
they
were
forgetful
of
all
else
that
is
in
their
sweet
interchange
of
flatteries
and
the
world
was
a
wilderness
to
them
both
when
the
youth
parted
with
bhanavar
by
the
brook
which
bounded
the
tents
of
her
tribe
it
was
on
a
night
when
they
were
so
together
the
damsel
leaning
on
his
arm
her
eyes
toward
the
lake
and
lo
what
seemed
the
reflection
of
a
large
star
in
the
water
and
there
was
darkness
in
the
sky
above
it
thick
clouds
and
no
sight
of
the
heavens
so
she
held
her
face
to
him
sideways
and
said
meaneth
this
o
my
betrothed
for
there
is
reflected
in
yonder
lake
a
light
as
of
a
star
and
there
is
no
star
visible
this
night
the
youth
trembled
as
one
in
trouble
of
spirit
and
exclaimed
not
on
it
o
my
soul
it
is
of
evil
omen
but
bhanavar
kept
her
gaze
constantly
on
the
light
and
the
light
increased
in
lustre
and
the
light
became
from
a
pale
sad
splendour
dazzling
in
its
brilliancy
listening
they
heard
presently
a
gurgling
noise
as
of
one
deeply
drinking
then
the
youth
sighed
a
heavy
sigh
and
said
is
the
serpent
of
the
lake
drinking
of
its
waters
as
is
her
wont
once
every
moon
and
whoso
heareth
her
drink
by
the
sheening
of
that
light
is
under
a
destiny
dark
and
imminent
so
know
i
my
days
are
numbered
and
it
was
foretold
of
me
this
now
the
youth
sought
to
dissuade
bhanavar
from
gazing
on
the
light
and
he
flung
his
whole
body
before
her
eyes
and
clasped
her
head
upon
his
breast
and
clung
about
her
caressing
her
yet
she
slipped
from
him
and
she
cried
me
of
this
serpent
and
of
this
light
so
he
said
not
to
hear
of
it
o
my
betrothed
then
she
gazed
at
the
light
a
moment
more
intently
and
turned
her
fair
shape
toward
him
and
put
up
her
long
white
fingers
to
his
chin
and
smoothed
him
with
their
softness
whispering
me
of
it
my
life
and
so
it
was
that
her
winningness
melted
him
and
he
said
the
serpent
is
the
serpent
of
the
lake
old
wise
powerful
of
the
brood
of
the
sacred
mountain
that
lifteth
by
day
a
peak
of
gold
and
by
night
a
point
of
solitary
silver
in
her
head
upon
her
forehead
between
her
eyes
there
is
a
jewel
and
it
is
this
light
then
she
said
came
the
jewel
there
in
such
a
place
he
answered
the
growth
of
one
thousand
years
in
the
head
of
the
serpent
she
cried
precious
he
answered
price
as
he
spake
the
tears
streamed
from
him
and
he
was
shaken
with
grief
but
she
noted
nought
of
this
and
watched
the
wonder
of
the
light
and
its
increasing
and
quivering
and
lengthening
and
the
light
was
as
an
arrow
of
beams
and
as
a
globe
of
radiance
desire
for
the
jewel
waxed
in
her
and
she
had
no
sight
but
for
it
alone
crying
a
jewel
exceeding
in
preciousness
all
jewels
that
are
and
for
the
possessing
it
would
i
forfeit
all
that
is
so
he
said
sorrowfully
love
o
bhanavar
and
our
hopes
of
espousal
but
she
cried
question
of
that
prove
now
thy
passion
for
me
o
warrior
and
win
for
me
that
jewel
then
he
pleaded
with
her
and
exclaimed
not
this
the
winning
of
the
jewel
is
worth
my
life
and
my
life
o
bhanavar
surely
its
breath
is
but
the
love
of
thee
so
she
said
fearest
a
risk
and
he
replied
fear
i
my
life
is
thine
to
cast
away
this
jewel
it
is
evil
to
have
and
evil
followeth
the
soul
that
hath
it
upon
that
she
cried
trick
to
cheat
me
of
the
jewel
thy
love
is
wanting
at
the
proof
and
she
taunted
the
youth
her
betrothed
and
turned
from
him
and
hardened
at
his
tenderness
and
made
her
sweet
shape
as
a
thorn
to
his
caressing
and
his
heart
was
charged
with
anguish
for
her
so
at
the
last
when
he
had
wept
a
space
in
silence
he
cried
hast
willed
it
the
jewel
shall
be
thine
o
my
soul
then
said
he
hast
willed
it
o
bhanavar
and
my
life
is
as
a
grain
of
sand
weighed
against
thy
wishes
allah
is
my
witness
meet
me
therefore
here
o
my
beloved
at
the
end
of
one
even
beneath
the
shadow
of
this
by
the
lake
and
at
this
hour
and
i
will
deliver
into
thy
hands
the
jewel
so
farewell
wind
me
once
about
with
thine
arms
that
i
may
take
comfort
from
thee
when
their
kiss
was
over
the
youth
led
her
silently
to
the
brook
of
their
parting
the
clear
cold
bubbling
brook
and
passed
from
her
sight
and
the
damsel
was
exulting
and
leapt
and
made
circles
in
her
glee
and
she
danced
and
rioted
and
sang
and
clapped
her
hands
crying
i
am
now
bhanavar
the
beautiful
how
shall
i
be
when
that
jewel
is
upon
me
the
bright
light
which
beameth
in
the
darkness
and
needeth
to
light
it
no
other
light
surely
there
will
be
envy
among
the
maidens
and
the
widows
and
my
name
and
the
odour
of
my
beauty
will
travel
to
the
courts
of
far
kings
so
was
she
jubilant
and
her
sisters
that
met
her
marvelled
at
her
and
the
deep
glow
that
was
upon
her
even
as
the
glow
of
the
great
desert
when
the
sun
has
fallen
and
they
said
among
themselves
is
covered
all
over
with
the
blush
of
one
that
is
a
bride
and
the
bridegroom
kiss
yet
burneth
upon
bhanavar
so
they
undressed
her
and
she
lay
among
them
and
was
all
night
even
as
a
bursting
rose
in
a
vase
filled
with
drooping
lilies
and
one
of
the
maidens
that
put
her
hand
on
the
left
breast
of
bhanavar
felt
it
full
and
the
heart
beneath
it
panting
and
beating
swifter
than
the
ground
is
struck
by
hooves
of
the
chosen
steed
sent
by
the
chieftain
to
the
city
of
his
people
with
news
of
victory
and
the
summons
for
rejoicing
now
the
nights
and
the
days
of
bhanavar
were
even
as
this
night
and
she
was
as
an
unquiet
soul
till
the
appointed
time
for
the
meeting
with
her
lover
had
come
then
when
the
sun
was
lighting
with
slant
beam
the
green
grass
slope
by
the
blue
brook
before
her
bhanavar
arrayed
herself
and
went
forth
gaily
as
a
martial
queen
to
certain
conquest
and
of
all
the
flowers
that
nodded
to
the
setting
yea
the
crimson
purple
pure
white
azure
and
saffron
there
was
no
flower
fairer
in
its
hues
than
bhanavar
nor
bird
of
the
heavens
freer
in
its
glittering
plumage
nor
shape
of
loveliness
such
as
hers
truly
when
she
had
taken
her
place
under
the
palm
by
the
waters
of
the
lake
that
was
no
exaggeration
of
the
poet
where
he
says
snows
of
the
were
mirror
there
beneath
her
feet
not
whiter
than
they
were
not
rosier
in
the
white
that
falling
flush
broad
on
the
wave
than
in
her
cheek
the
blush
and
again
she
draws
the
heavens
down
to
her
so
rare
she
is
so
fair
she
is
they
flutter
with
a
crown
to
her
and
lighten
only
where
she
is
and
he
exclaims
in
verse
that
applieth
to
her
exquisite
slenderness
sleek
little
antelope
serpent
of
sweetness
eagle
that
soaringly
wins
me
adoringly
teach
me
thy
fleetness
vision
of
loveliness
turn
to
my
tenderness
now
when
the
sun
was
lost
to
earth
and
all
was
darkness
bhanavar
fixed
her
eyes
upon
an
opening
arch
of
foliage
in
the
glade
through
which
the
youth
her
lover
should
come
to
her
and
clasped
both
hands
across
her
bosom
so
shaken
was
she
with
eager
longing
and
expectation
in
her
hunger
for
his
approach
she
would
at
whiles
pluck
up
the
herbage
about
her
by
the
roots
and
toss
handfuls
this
way
and
that
chiding
the
peaceful
song
of
the
nightbird
in
the
leaves
above
her
head
and
she
was
sinking
with
fretfulness
when
lo
from
the
opening
arch
of
the
glade
a
sudden
light
and
bhanavar
knew
it
for
the
jewel
in
the
fingers
of
her
betrothed
by
the
strength
of
its
effulgence
then
she
called
to
him
joyfully
a
cry
of
welcome
and
quickened
his
coming
with
her
calls
and
the
youth
alighted
from
his
mare
and
left
it
to
pasture
and
advanced
to
her
holding
aloft
the
jewel
and
the
jewel
was
of
great
size
and
purity
round
and
throwing
rays
and
beams
everywhere
about
it
a
miracle
to
behold
the
light
in
it
shining
and
as
the
very
life
of
the
blood
a
sweet
crimson
a
ruby
a
softer
rose
an
amethyst
of
tender
hues
it
was
a
full
globe
of
splendours
showing
like
a
very
kingdom
of
the
blest
and
blessed
was
the
eye
beholding
it
so
when
he
was
within
reach
of
her
arm
the
damsel
sprang
to
him
and
caught
from
his
hand
the
jewel
and
held
it
before
her
eyes
and
danced
with
it
and
pressed
it
on
her
bosom
and
was
as
a
creature
giddy
with
great
joy
in
possessing
it
and
she
put
the
jewel
in
her
bosom
and
looked
on
the
youth
to
thank
him
for
the
jewel
with
all
her
beauty
for
the
passion
of
a
mighty
pride
in
him
who
had
won
for
her
the
jewel
exalted
bhanavar
and
she
said
sweetly
hast
thou
proved
to
me
thy
love
of
me
and
i
am
thine
o
my
betrothed
wholly
thine
kiss
me
then
and
cease
not
kissing
me
for
bliss
is
in
me
but
the
youth
eyed
her
sorrowfully
even
as
one
that
hath
great
yearning
and
no
power
to
move
or
speak
so
she
said
again
in
the
low
melody
of
deep
me
o
my
lover
for
i
desire
thy
kiss
still
he
spake
not
and
was
as
a
pillar
of
stone
and
she
started
and
cried
art
whole
without
a
hurt
then
sought
she
to
coax
him
to
her
with
all
the
softness
of
her
eyes
and
budded
lips
saying
an
idle
fear
and
i
have
thee
and
thou
art
mine
and
i
am
thine
so
speak
to
me
my
lover
for
there
is
no
music
like
the
music
of
thy
voice
and
the
absence
of
it
is
the
absence
of
all
sweetness
and
there
is
no
pleasure
in
life
without
it
so
the
tenderness
of
her
fondling
melted
the
silence
in
him
and
presently
his
tongue
was
loosed
and
he
breathed
in
pain
of
spirit
and
his
words
were
the
words
of
the
proverb
he
that
fighteth
with
poison
is
no
match
for
the
prick
of
a
thorn
and
he
said
o
bhanavar
my
love
for
thee
surpasseth
what
is
told
of
others
that
have
loved
before
us
and
i
count
no
loss
a
loss
that
is
for
thy
sake
and
he
sighed
and
sang
sadder
than
is
the
moon
lost
light
lost
ere
the
kindling
of
dawn
to
travellers
journeying
on
the
shutting
of
thy
fair
face
from
my
sight
might
i
look
on
thee
in
death
with
bliss
i
would
yield
my
breath
oh
what
warrior
dies
with
heaven
in
his
eyes
o
bhanavar
too
rich
a
prize
the
life
of
my
nostrils
art
thou
the
on
my
brow
thou
art
the
perfume
i
meet
as
i
speed
the
plains
the
strength
of
my
arms
the
blood
of
my
veins
then
said
he
make
nothing
matter
of
complaint
allah
witnesseth
not
even
the
long
parting
from
her
i
love
what
will
be
will
be
so
was
it
written
is
but
a
scratch
o
my
soul
yet
am
i
of
the
dead
and
them
that
are
passed
away
is
hard
but
i
smile
in
the
face
of
bitterness
now
at
his
words
the
damsel
clutched
him
with
both
her
hands
and
the
blood
went
from
her
and
she
was
as
a
block
of
white
marble
even
as
one
of
those
we
meet
in
the
desert
leaning
together
marking
the
wrath
of
the
on
forgotten
cities
and
the
tongue
of
the
damsel
was
dry
and
she
was
without
speech
gazing
at
him
with
eyes
like
one
in
trance
then
she
started
as
a
dreamer
wakeneth
and
flung
herself
quickly
on
the
breast
of
the
youth
and
put
up
the
sleeve
from
his
arm
and
beheld
by
the
beams
of
the
that
had
risen
through
the
leaves
a
small
bite
on
the
arm
of
the
youth
her
betrothed
spotted
with
seven
spots
of
blood
in
a
crescent
so
she
knew
that
the
poison
of
the
serpent
had
entered
by
that
bite
and
she
loosened
herself
to
the
violence
of
her
anguish
shrieking
the
shrieks
of
despair
so
that
the
voice
of
her
lamentation
was
multiplied
about
and
made
many
voices
in
the
night
her
spirit
returned
not
to
her
till
the
crescent
of
the
moon
was
yellow
to
its
fall
and
lo
the
youth
was
sighing
heavy
sighs
and
leaning
to
the
ground
on
one
elbow
and
she
flung
herself
by
him
on
the
ground
seeking
for
herbs
that
were
antidotes
to
the
poison
of
the
serpent
grovelling
among
the
grasses
and
strewn
leaves
of
the
wood
peering
at
them
tearfully
by
the
pale
beams
and
startling
the
insects
as
she
moved
when
she
had
gathered
some
she
pressed
them
and
bruised
them
and
laid
them
along
his
lips
that
were
white
as
the
ball
of
an
eye
and
she
made
him
drink
drops
of
the
juices
of
the
herbs
wailing
and
swaying
her
body
across
him
as
one
that
seeketh
vainly
to
give
brightness
again
to
the
flames
of
a
dying
fire
but
now
his
time
was
drawing
nigh
and
he
was
weak
and
took
her
hand
in
his
and
gazed
on
her
face
sighing
and
said
is
nothing
shall
keep
me
by
thee
now
o
my
betrothed
my
beautiful
weep
not
for
it
is
the
doing
of
fate
and
not
thy
doing
so
ere
i
go
and
the
separates
thy
heart
from
my
heart
listen
to
me
lo
that
jewel
it
is
the
giver
of
years
and
of
powers
and
of
loveliness
beyond
mortal
yet
the
wearing
of
it
availeth
not
in
the
pursuit
of
happiness
now
art
thou
queen
over
the
serpents
of
this
lake
it
was
the
i
slew
and
her
vengeance
is
on
me
here
now
art
thou
mighty
o
bhanavar
and
look
to
do
well
by
thy
tribe
and
that
from
which
i
spring
recompensing
my
father
for
his
loss
pouring
ointment
on
his
affliction
for
great
is
the
grief
of
the
old
man
and
he
loveth
me
and
is
childless
then
the
youth
fell
back
and
was
still
and
bhanavar
put
her
ear
to
his
mouth
and
heard
what
seemed
an
inner
voice
murmuring
in
him
and
it
was
of
his
infancy
and
his
boyhood
and
of
his
father
the
emir
first
gift
to
him
his
horse
zoora
in
old
times
presently
the
youth
revived
somewhat
and
looked
upon
her
but
his
sight
was
glazed
with
a
film
and
she
sang
her
name
to
him
ere
he
knew
her
and
the
sad
sweetness
of
her
name
filled
his
soul
and
he
replied
to
her
with
it
weakly
like
a
far
echo
that
groweth
fainter
bhanavar
bhanavar
then
a
change
came
over
him
and
the
pain
of
the
poison
and
the
passion
of
the
and
he
was
wistful
of
her
no
more
but
she
lay
by
him
embracing
him
and
in
the
last
violence
of
his
anguish
he
hugged
her
to
his
breast
then
it
was
over
and
he
sank
and
the
twain
were
as
a
great
wave
heaving
upon
the
shore
lo
part
is
wasted
where
it
falleth
part
draweth
back
into
the
waters
so
was
it
now
the
chill
of
dawn
breathed
blue
on
the
lake
and
was
astir
among
the
dewy
leaves
of
the
wood
when
bhanavar
arose
from
the
body
of
the
youth
and
as
she
rose
she
saw
that
his
mare
zoora
his
father
first
gift
was
snuffing
at
the
ear
of
her
dead
master
and
pawing
him
at
that
sight
the
tears
poured
from
her
eyelids
and
she
sobbed
out
to
the
mare
zoora
never
mare
bore
nobler
burden
on
her
back
than
thou
in
zurvan
my
betrothed
zoora
thou
weepest
for
death
is
first
known
to
thee
in
the
dearest
thing
that
was
thine
as
to
me
in
the
dearest
that
was
mine
and
o
zoora
steed
of
zurvan
my
betrothed
there
no
loveliness
for
us
in
life
for
the
loveliest
is
gone
and
let
us
die
zoora
mare
of
zurvan
my
betrothed
for
what
is
dying
to
us
o
zoora
who
cherish
beyond
all
that
which
death
has
taken
so
spake
she
to
zoora
the
mare
kissing
her
and
running
her
fingers
through
the
long
white
mane
of
the
mare
then
she
stooped
to
the
body
of
her
betrothed
and
toiled
with
it
to
lift
it
across
the
crimson
cloth
that
was
on
the
back
of
zoora
and
the
mare
knelt
to
her
that
she
might
lay
on
her
back
the
body
of
zurvan
when
that
was
done
bhanavar
paced
beside
zoora
the
mare
weeping
and
caressing
her
reminding
her
of
the
deeds
of
zurvan
and
the
battles
she
had
borne
him
to
and
his
greatness
and
his
gentleness
and
the
mare
went
without
leading
it
was
broad
light
when
they
had
passed
the
glade
and
the
covert
of
the
wood
before
them
between
great
mountains
glimmered
a
space
of
rolling
grass
fed
to
deep
greenness
by
many
brooks
the
shadow
of
a
mountain
was
over
it
and
one
slant
of
the
rising
sun
down
a
glade
of
the
mountain
touched
the
green
tent
of
the
emir
where
it
stood
a
little
apart
from
the
others
of
his
tribe
goats
and
asses
of
the
tribe
were
pasturing
in
the
quiet
but
save
them
nothing
moved
among
the
tents
and
it
was
deep
peacefulness
bhanavar
led
zoora
slowly
before
the
tent
of
the
emir
and
disburdened
zoora
of
the
helpless
weight
and
spread
the
long
fair
limbs
of
the
youth
lengthwise
across
the
threshold
of
the
emir
tent
sitting
away
from
it
with
clasped
hands
regarding
it
ere
long
the
emir
came
forth
and
his
foot
was
on
the
body
of
his
son
and
he
knew
death
on
the
chin
and
the
eyes
of
zurvan
his
sole
son
now
the
emir
was
old
and
with
the
shock
of
that
sight
the
world
darkened
before
him
and
he
gave
forth
a
groan
and
stumbled
over
the
sunken
breast
of
zurvan
and
stretched
over
him
as
one
without
life
when
bhanavar
saw
that
old
man
stretched
over
the
body
of
his
son
she
sickened
and
her
ear
was
filled
with
the
wailings
of
grief
that
would
arise
and
she
stood
up
and
stole
away
from
the
habitations
of
the
tribe
stricken
with
her
guilt
and
wandered
beyond
the
mountains
knowing
not
whither
she
went
looking
on
no
living
thing
for
the
sight
of
a
thing
that
moved
was
hateful
to
her
and
all
sounds
were
sounds
of
lamentation
for
a
great
loss
now
she
had
wandered
on
alone
two
days
and
two
nights
and
nigh
morn
she
was
seized
with
a
swoon
of
weariness
and
fell
forward
with
her
face
to
the
earth
and
lay
there
prostrate
even
as
one
that
is
adoring
the
shrine
and
it
was
on
the
sands
of
the
desert
she
was
lying
it
chanced
that
the
chieftain
of
a
desert
tribe
passed
at
midday
by
the
spot
and
seeing
the
figure
of
a
damsel
unshaded
by
any
shade
of
tree
or
herb
or
and
prostrate
on
the
sands
he
reined
his
steed
and
leaned
forward
to
her
and
called
to
her
then
as
she
answered
nothing
he
dismounted
and
thrust
his
arm
softly
beneath
her
and
lifted
her
gently
and
her
swoon
had
the
whiteness
of
death
so
that
he
thought
her
dead
verily
and
the
marvel
of
her
great
loveliness
in
death
smote
the
heart
on
his
ribs
as
with
a
blow
and
the
powers
of
life
went
from
him
a
moment
as
he
looked
on
her
and
the
long
dark
wet
lashes
that
clung
to
her
colourless
face
as
at
night
in
groves
where
the
betrothed
ones
wander
the
slender
leaves
of
the
acacia
spread
darkly
over
the
full
moon
and
he
cried
a
loveliness
that
maketh
the
soul
yearn
to
the
cold
bosom
of
death
so
lovely
exceeding
all
that
liveth
is
she
after
he
had
contemplated
her
longwhile
he
snatched
his
sight
from
her
and
swung
her
swiftly
on
the
back
of
his
mare
and
leaned
her
on
one
arm
and
sped
westward
over
the
sands
of
the
desert
halting
not
till
he
was
in
the
hum
of
many
tents
and
the
sun
of
that
day
hung
a
red
across
the
sand
he
alighted
before
the
tent
of
his
mother
and
sent
women
in
to
her
when
his
mother
came
forth
to
the
greetings
of
her
son
he
said
no
word
but
pointed
to
the
damsel
where
he
had
leaned
her
at
the
threshold
of
her
tent
his
mother
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
and
turned
her
shoulder
to
peer
upon
the
damsel
but
when
she
had
close
view
of
bhanavar
she
spat
and
scattered
her
hair
and
stamped
and
cried
aloud
with
her
this
slut
of
darkness
there
poison
on
her
very
skirts
and
evil
in
the
look
of
her
then
said
he
rukrooth
my
mother
art
thou
lost
to
charity
and
the
uses
of
kindliness
and
the
laws
of
hospitality
that
thou
talkest
this
of
the
damsel
a
stranger
take
her
now
in
and
if
she
be
past
help
as
i
fear
be
it
thy
care
to
give
her
decent
burial
and
if
she
live
o
my
mother
tend
her
for
the
love
of
thy
son
and
for
the
love
of
him
be
gentle
with
her
while
he
spake
rukrooth
his
mother
knelt
over
the
damsel
as
a
cat
that
sniffeth
the
suspected
dish
and
she
flashed
her
eyes
back
on
him
exclaiming
scornfully
art
thou
befooled
and
the
poison
is
already
in
thee
but
i
will
not
have
her
o
my
son
and
thou
ruark
my
son
neither
shalt
thou
have
her
what
will
i
not
die
to
save
thee
from
a
harm
surely
thy
frown
is
little
to
me
my
son
if
i
save
thee
from
a
harm
and
the
damsel
here
is
i
shudder
to
think
what
but
never
lay
shadow
across
my
threshold
dark
as
this
now
ruark
gazed
upon
his
mother
and
upon
bhanavar
and
the
face
of
bhanavar
was
as
a
babe
in
sleep
and
his
soul
melted
to
the
parted
sweetness
of
her
soft
little
curved
red
lips
and
her
closed
eyelids
and
her
innocent
open
hands
where
she
lay
at
the
threshold
of
the
tent
unconscious
of
hardness
and
the
sayings
of
the
unjust
so
he
cried
fiercely
paltering
o
rukrooth
my
mother
and
if
not
to
thy
tent
then
to
mine
when
she
heard
him
say
that
in
the
voice
of
his
anger
rukrooth
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
sorrowfully
and
sighed
and
went
up
to
him
and
drew
his
head
once
against
her
heart
and
retreated
into
the
tent
bidding
the
women
that
were
there
bring
in
the
body
of
the
damsel
it
was
the
morning
of
another
day
when
bhanavar
awoke
and
she
awoke
in
a
dream
of
zoora
the
mare
of
zurvan
her
betrothed
that
was
dead
and
the
name
of
zoora
was
on
her
tongue
as
she
started
up
she
was
on
a
couch
of
silk
and
at
her
feet
a
fair
young
girl
with
a
fan
of
pheasant
feathers
she
stared
at
the
hangings
of
the
tent
which
were
richer
than
those
of
her
own
tribe
the
cloths
and
the
cushions
and
the
embroideries
and
the
strangeness
of
all
was
pain
to
her
she
knew
not
why
then
wept
she
bitterly
and
with
her
tears
the
memory
of
what
had
been
came
back
to
her
and
she
opened
her
arms
to
take
into
them
the
little
girl
that
fanned
her
that
she
might
love
something
and
be
beloved
awhile
and
the
child
sobbed
with
her
after
a
time
bhanavar
said
am
i
and
amongst
whom
my
child
my
sister
and
the
child
answered
her
in
the
tent
of
the
mother
of
ruark
the
chief
even
chief
of
the
and
he
found
thee
in
the
desert
nigh
dead
is
so
and
this
morning
will
ruark
be
gone
to
meet
the
challenge
of
ebn
asrac
and
they
will
fight
at
the
foot
of
the
snow
mountains
and
the
shadow
of
yonder
will
be
over
our
tent
here
at
the
hour
they
fight
and
i
shall
sing
for
ruark
and
kneel
here
in
the
darkness
of
the
shadow
while
the
child
was
speaking
there
entered
to
them
a
tall
aged
woman
with
one
swathe
of
a
turban
across
her
long
level
brows
and
she
had
hard
black
eyes
and
close
lips
and
a
square
chin
and
it
was
the
mother
of
ruark
she
strode
forward
toward
bhanavar
to
greet
her
and
folded
her
legs
before
the
damsel
presently
she
said
me
thy
story
and
of
thy
coming
into
the
hands
of
ruark
my
son
bhanavar
shuddered
so
rukrooth
dismissed
the
little
maiden
from
the
chamber
of
the
tent
and
laid
her
left
hand
on
one
arm
of
bhanavar
and
said
would
know
whence
comest
thou
that
we
may
deal
well
by
thee
and
thy
people
that
have
lost
thee
the
touch
of
a
hand
was
as
the
touch
of
a
corpse
to
bhanavar
and
the
damsel
was
constrained
to
speak
by
a
power
she
knew
not
of
and
she
told
all
to
rukrooth
of
what
had
been
the
great
misery
and
the
wickedness
that
was
hers
then
ruark
mother
took
hold
of
bhanavar
a
strong
grasp
and
eyed
her
long
piteously
and
with
reproach
and
rocked
forward
and
back
and
kept
rocking
to
and
fro
crying
at
intervals
ruark
my
son
my
son
this
feared
i
and
thou
art
not
the
first
and
i
saw
it
i
saw
it
why
came
she
in
thy
way
why
ruark
my
son
my
canst
thou
be
saved
by
me
fated
that
thou
art
thou
and
wilt
thou
be
saved
by
me
my
son
ere
thy
story
be
told
in
tears
as
this
one
that
is
as
thine
to
me
and
thou
wilt
seize
a
jewel
ruark
o
thou
soul
of
wrath
my
son
my
dazzling
chief
and
seize
it
to
wear
it
and
think
it
bliss
this
lovely
jewel
but
is
an
anguish
endless
and
for
ever
my
son
woe
me
an
anguish
is
she
without
end
rukrooth
continued
moaning
and
the
thought
that
was
in
the
mother
of
ruark
struck
bhanavar
like
a
light
in
the
land
of
despair
that
darkly
illumineth
the
dreaded
gulfs
and
abysses
of
the
land
and
she
knew
herself
black
in
evil
and
the
scourge
of
her
guilt
was
upon
her
and
she
cursed
herself
before
rukrooth
and
fawned
before
her
abasing
her
body
so
rukrooth
was
drawn
to
the
damsel
by
the
violence
of
her
and
her
abandonment
to
grief
and
lifted
her
and
comforted
her
and
after
awhile
they
had
gentle
speech
together
and
the
two
women
opened
their
hearts
and
wept
then
it
was
agreed
between
them
that
bhanavar
should
depart
from
the
encampment
of
the
tribe
before
the
return
of
ruark
and
seek
shelter
among
her
own
people
again
and
aid
them
and
the
tribe
of
zurvan
her
betrothed
by
the
might
of
the
jewel
which
was
hers
fulfilling
the
desire
of
zurvan
the
mind
of
the
damsel
was
lowly
and
her
soul
yearned
for
the
blessing
of
rukrooth
darkness
hung
over
the
tent
from
the
shadow
of
the
when
bhanavar
departed
and
the
blessing
of
rukrooth
was
on
her
head
she
went
forth
fairly
mounted
on
a
fresh
steed
beside
her
two
warriors
of
them
that
were
left
to
guard
the
encampment
of
the
tribe
of
ruark
in
his
absence
and
rukrooth
watched
at
the
threshold
of
her
tent
for
the
coming
of
ruark
when
it
was
middle
night
and
the
splendour
of
the
moon
was
beaming
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
bhanavar
alighted
to
rest
by
the
twigs
of
a
tamarisk
that
stood
singly
on
the
sands
the
two
warriors
tied
the
fetlocks
of
their
steeds
and
spread
shawls
for
her
and
watched
over
her
while
she
slept
and
the
damsel
dreamed
and
the
roaring
of
the
lion
was
hoarse
in
her
dream
and
it
was
to
her
as
were
she
the
red
whirlwind
of
the
desert
before
whom
all
bowed
in
terror
the
arab
the
wild
horsemen
and
the
caravans
of
pilgrimage
and
none
could
stay
her
neither
could
she
stay
herself
for
the
curse
of
allah
was
on
men
by
reason
of
her
guilt
and
she
went
swinging
great
folds
of
darkness
across
kingdoms
and
empires
of
earth
where
joy
was
and
peace
of
spirit
and
in
her
track
amazement
and
calamity
and
the
whitened
bones
of
noble
youths
valorous
chieftains
in
that
horror
of
her
dream
she
stood
up
suddenly
and
thrust
forth
her
hands
as
to
avert
an
evil
and
advanced
a
step
and
with
the
act
her
dream
was
cloven
and
she
awoke
and
lo
it
was
sunrise
and
where
had
been
two
warriors
of
the
were
now
five
and
besides
her
own
steed
five
others
one
the
steed
of
ruark
and
ruark
with
them
that
watched
over
her
pale
was
the
visage
of
the
chief
ruark
eyed
bhanavar
and
signalled
to
his
followers
and
they
when
they
had
lifted
the
damsel
to
her
steed
and
placed
her
in
their
front
mounted
likewise
and
flourished
their
lances
with
cries
and
jerked
their
heels
to
the
flanks
of
their
steeds
and
stretched
forward
till
their
beards
were
mixed
with
the
tossing
manes
and
the
dust
rose
after
them
crimson
in
the
sun
so
they
coursed
away
speeding
behind
their
chief
and
bhanavar
sweet
were
the
desert
herbs
under
their
crushing
hooves
ere
the
shadow
of
the
acacia
measured
less
than
its
height
they
came
upon
a
spring
of
silver
water
and
ruark
leaped
from
his
steed
and
bhanavar
from
hers
and
they
performed
their
ablutions
by
that
spring
and
ate
and
drank
and
watered
their
steeds
while
they
were
there
bhanavar
lifted
her
eyes
to
ruark
and
said
takest
thou
me
o
my
chief
his
brow
was
stern
and
he
answered
to
the
dwelling
of
thy
tribe
then
she
wept
and
pulled
her
veil
close
murmuring
well
they
spake
no
further
and
pursued
their
journey
toward
the
mountains
and
across
the
desert
that
was
as
a
sea
asleep
in
the
blazing
heat
and
the
sun
till
his
setting
threw
no
shade
upon
the
sands
bigger
than
what
was
broad
above
them
by
the
beams
of
the
growing
moon
they
entered
the
first
gorge
of
the
mountains
here
they
relaxed
the
swiftness
of
their
pace
picking
their
way
over
broken
rocks
and
stunted
shrubs
and
the
mesh
of
spotted
creeping
plants
all
around
them
in
shadow
a
freshness
of
noisy
rivulets
and
cool
scents
of
flowers
asphodel
and
rose
blooming
in
plots
from
the
crevices
of
the
crags
these
as
the
troop
advanced
wound
and
widened
gradually
receding
and
their
summits
which
were
silver
in
the
moonlight
took
in
the
distance
a
robe
of
purple
and
the
sides
of
the
mountains
were
rounded
away
in
purple
beyond
a
space
of
emerald
pasture
now
ruark
beheld
the
heaviness
of
bhanavar
and
that
she
drooped
in
her
seat
and
he
halted
her
by
a
cave
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
browed
with
white
broom
before
it
over
grass
and
cresses
ran
a
rill
a
branch
from
others
larger
ones
that
went
hurrying
from
the
heights
to
feed
the
meadows
below
and
bhanavar
dipped
her
hand
in
the
rill
and
thought
am
no
more
as
thou
rill
of
the
mountain
but
a
desert
thing
thy
way
is
forward
thy
end
before
thee
but
i
go
this
way
and
that
my
end
is
dark
to
me
not
a
life
is
mine
that
will
have
its
close
kissing
the
cold
cheeks
of
the
cold
art
thou
and
i
flames
they
that
lean
to
thee
are
refreshed
they
that
touch
me
perish
then
she
looked
forth
on
the
stars
that
were
above
the
purple
heights
and
the
blushes
of
inner
heaven
that
streamed
up
the
sky
and
a
fear
of
meeting
the
eyes
of
her
kindred
possessed
her
and
she
cried
out
to
ruark
chief
of
the
must
this
be
and
is
there
no
help
for
it
but
that
i
return
among
them
that
look
on
me
basely
ruark
stooped
to
her
and
said
me
thy
name
she
answered
is
my
name
with
that
people
and
he
whispered
when
they
speak
of
thee
they
say
not
bhanavar
solely
but
bhanavar
the
beautiful
she
started
and
sought
the
eye
of
the
chief
and
it
was
fixed
on
her
face
in
a
softened
light
as
if
his
soul
had
said
that
thing
then
she
sighed
and
exclaimed
are
the
beautiful
born
to
misery
allah
dressed
them
in
his
grace
and
favour
for
their
certain
wretchedness
lo
their
countenances
are
as
the
sun
their
existence
as
the
desert
barren
are
they
in
fruits
and
waters
a
snare
to
themselves
and
to
others
now
the
chief
leaned
to
her
yet
nearer
saying
me
the
jewel
bhanavar
caught
up
her
hands
and
clenched
them
and
she
cried
bitterly
known
to
thee
she
told
thee
and
there
be
none
that
know
it
not
arising
she
thrust
her
hand
into
her
bosom
and
held
forth
the
jewel
in
the
palm
of
her
white
hand
when
ruark
beheld
the
marvel
of
the
jewel
and
the
redness
moving
in
it
as
of
a
panting
heart
and
the
flashing
eye
of
fire
that
it
was
and
all
its
glory
he
cried
was
indeed
a
jewel
for
queens
to
covet
from
the
serpent
and
a
prize
the
noblest
might
risk
all
to
win
as
a
gift
for
thee
then
she
said
voice
is
friendly
with
me
o
ruark
and
thou
scornest
not
the
creature
that
i
am
counsel
me
as
to
my
dealing
with
the
jewel
surely
the
eyes
of
the
chief
met
the
eyes
of
bhanavar
as
when
the
brightest
stars
of
midnight
are
doubled
in
a
clear
dark
lake
and
he
sang
in
measured
music
i
counsel
the
moon
in
her
ascending
stay
under
that
tall
through
the
night
rest
on
the
by
the
couching

o
thou
enthroned

of

and
for
ever
the
lustre
thou

on
the
fair
long
brook
that
leaps
and
leaps
silvery
leaps
and

by
the
mountain
walls
moon
and
arise
no
more
to
crown
the
steeps
for
a
danger
and
dolour

thy
wending
and
o
bhanavar
bhanavar
the
beautiful
shall
i
counsel
thee
moon
of
loveliness
bright
full
perfect
moon
counsel
thee
not
to
ascend
and
be
seen
and
worshipped
of
men
sitting
above
them
in
majesty
thou
that
art
thyself
the
jewel
beyond
price
wah
what
if
thou
cast
it
from
thee
thy
beauty
remaineth
and
bhanavar
smote
her
palms
in
the
moonlight
and
exclaimed
then
shall
i
escape
this
in
me
which
is
a
curse
to
them
that
approach
me
and
he
replied
long
we
the

the

of
the
sea
because
in
its
depths
there
the
death
we
flee

because
thou
art
deathly
the
less

thee
she
sang
aloud
among
the
rocks
and
the
caves
and
the
illumined
waters
destiny
destiny
why
am
i
so
dark
i
that
have
beauty
and
love
to

destiny

but
a

in

thus
like
a
poisonous

deadly
sweet

destiny
lo
my
soul
is
tired
make
me
thy
plaything
no
more
i
entreat
ruark
laughed
low
and
said
is
this
dread
of
rukrooth
my
mother
which
weigheth
on
thee
but
silliness
for
she
saw
thee
willing
to
do
well
by
her
and
thou
with
thy
jewel
o
bhanavar
do
thou
but
well
by
thyself
and
there
will
be
no
woman
such
as
thou
in
power
and
excellence
of
endowments
as
there
is
nowhere
one
such
as
thou
in
beauty
then
he
sighed
to
her
i
look
up
to
thee
o
my
queen
of
serpents
and
he
breathed
as
one
that
is
losing
breath
and
the
words
came
from
him
soul
is
thine
when
she
heard
him
say
this
great
trouble
was
on
the
damsel
for
his
voice
was
not
the
voice
of
zurvan
her
betrothed
and
she
remembered
the
sorrow
of
rukrooth
she
would
have
fled
from
him
but
a
dread
of
the
displeasure
of
the
chief
restrained
her
knowing
ruark
a
soul
of
wrath
her
eyelids
dropped
and
the
chief
gazed
on
her
eagerly
and
sang
in
a
passion
of
praises
of
her
the
fires
of
his
love
had
a
tongue
his
speech
was
a
torrent
of
flame
at
the
feet
of
the
damsel
and
bhanavar
exclaimed
what
am
i
what
am
i
who
have
slain
my
love
my
lover
that
one
should
love
me
and
call
on
me
for
love
my
life
is
a
long
weeping
for
him
death
is
my
wooer
ruark
still
pleaded
with
her
and
she
said
in
fair
gentleness
not
of
it
now
in
the
freshness
of
my
grief
other
times
and
seasons
are
there
my
soul
is
but
newly
widowed
fierce
was
the
eye
of
the
chief
and
he
sprang
up
crying
the
life
of
my
head
i
know
thy
wiles
and
the
reading
of
these
delays
but
never
leave
thee
nor
lose
sight
of
thee
bhanavar
and
think
not
to
fly
from
me
thou
subtle
brilliant
serpent
for
thy
track
is
my
track
and
thy
condition
my
condition
and
thy
fate
my
fate
by
allah
this
is
so
then
he
strode
from
her
swiftly
and
called
to
his
arabs
they
had
kindled
a
fire
to
roast
the
flesh
of
a
buffalo
slaughtered
by
them
from
among
a
herd
and
were
laughing
and
singing
beside
the
flames
of
the
fire
so
by
the
direction
of
their
chief
the
arabs
brought
slices
of
sweet
to
bhanavar
with
cakes
of
grain
and
bhanavar
ate
alone
and
drank
from
the
waters
before
her
then
they
laid
for
her
a
couch
within
the
cave
and
the
aching
of
her
spirit
was
lulled
and
she
slept
there
a
dreamless
sleep
till
morning
by
the
morning
light
bhanavar
looked
abroad
for
the
chief
and
he
was
nowhere
by
a
pang
of
violent
hope
struck
through
her
and
she
pressed
her
bosom
praying
he
might
have
left
her
and
climbed
the
clefts
and
ledges
of
the
mountain
to
search
over
the
fair
expanse
of
pasture
beyond
for
a
trace
of
him
departing
the
sun
was
on
the
heads
of
the
heavy
flowers
and
a
flood
of
gold
down
the
gorges
and
a
delicate
rose
hue
on
the
distant
peaks
and
upper
dells
of
snow
which
were
as
a
crown
to
the
scene
she
surveyed
but
no
sight
of
ruark
had
she
and
now
she
was
beginning
to
rejoice
but
on
a
sudden
her
eye
caught
far
to
east
a
glimpse
of
something
in
motion
across
an
even
slope
of
the
lower
hills
leaning
to
the
valley
and
it
was
a
herd
that
rushed
forward
like
a
black
torrent
of
the
mountains
flinging
foam
this
way
and
that
and
after
the
herd
and
at
the
sides
of
the
herd
she
distinguished
the
white
cloaks
and
scarfs
and
glittering
steel
of
the
arabs
of
ruark
presently
she
saw
a
horseman
break
from
the
rest
and
race
in
a
line
toward
her
she
knew
this
one
for
ruark
and
sighed
and
descended
slowly
to
meet
him
the
greeting
of
the
chief
was
sharp
his
manner
wild
and
he
said
little
ere
he
said
will
see
thee
under
the
light
of
the
jewel
so
tie
it
in
a
band
and
set
it
on
thy
brow
bhanavar
her
mouth
was
open
to
intercede
with
his
desire
but
his
forehead
became
black
as
night
and
he
shouted
in
the
thunder
of
his
this
she
took
the
jewel
from
its
warm
bed
in
her
bosom
and
held
it
and
got
together
a
band
of
green
weeds
and
set
it
in
the
middle
of
the
band
and
tied
the
band
on
her
brow
and
lifted
her
countenance
to
the
chief
ruark
stood
back
from
her
and
gazed
on
her
and
he
would
have
veiled
his
sight
from
her
but
his
hand
fell
then
the
might
of
her
loveliness
seized
bhanavar
likewise
and
the
full
orbs
of
her
eyes
glowed
on
the
chief
as
on
a
mirror
and
she
moved
her
serpent
figure
scornfully
and
smiled
saying
it
well
and
he
when
he
could
speak
replied
well
i
have
seen
thee
for
now
can
i
die
this
day
if
it
be
that
i
am
to
die
and
well
it
is
for
now
know
i
there
is
truly
no
place
but
the
tomb
can
hold
me
from
thee
bhanavar
put
the
jewel
from
her
brow
into
her
bosom
and
questioned
him
is
thy
dread
this
day
o
my
chief
he
answered
her
gravely
have
seen
rukrooth
my
mother
while
i
slept
and
she
was
weeping
weeping
by
a
stream
yea
a
stream
of
blood
and
it
was
a
stream
that
flowed
in
a
hundred
gushes
from
her
own
veins
the
sun
of
this
dawn
now
seest
thou
not
is
overcrimson
the
vulture
hangeth
low
down
yonder
valley
and
he
cried
to
her
mount
with
me
for
i
have
told
rukrooth
a
thing
and
i
know
that
woman
crafty
in
the
thwarting
of
schemes
such
a
fox
is
she
where
aught
accordeth
not
with
her
forecastings
and
the
judgment
of
her
love
for
me
by
allah
well
we
clash
not
for
that
i
will
do
i
do
and
that
she
will
do
doth
she
so
the
twain
mounted
their
steeds
and
ruark
gathered
his
arabs
and
placed
them
some
in
advance
some
on
either
side
of
bhanavar
and
they
rode
forward
to
the
head
of
the
valley
and
across
the
meadows
through
the
blushing
crowds
of
flowers
baths
of
freshest
scents
cool
breezes
that
awoke
in
the
nostrils
of
the
mares
neighings
of
delight
and
these
pranced
and
curvetted
and
swung
their
tails
and
gave
expression
to
their
joy
in
many
graceful
fashions
but
a
gloom
was
on
ruark
and
a
quick
fire
in
his
and
he
rode
with
heels
alert
on
the
flanks
of
his
mare
dashing
onward
to
right
and
left
as
do
they
that
beat
the
jungle
for
the
crouching
tiger
once
when
he
was
half
a
league
in
front
he
wheeled
his
mare
and
raced
back
full
on
bhanavar
grasping
her
bridle
and
hissing
between
his
teeth
a
soul
shall
have
thee
save
i
by
the
tomb
of
my
fathers
never
while
life
is
with
us
and
he
taunted
her
with
bitter
names
and
was
as
one
in
the
madness
of
intoxication
drunken
with
the
aspect
of
her
matchless
beauty
and
with
exceeding
love
for
her
and
bhanavar
knew
that
the
dread
of
a
mishap
was
on
the
mind
of
the
chief
now
the
space
of
pasture
was
behind
them
a
broad
lake
of
gold
and
jasper
and
they
entered
a
region
of
hills
heights
and
fastnesses
robed
in
forests
that
rose
in
rounded
swells
of
leafage
each
over
each
above
all
points
of
snow
that
were
as
flickering
silver
flames
in
the
farthest
blue
this
was
the
country
of
bhanavar
and
she
gazed
mournfully
on
the
glades
of
golden
green
and
the
glens
of
iron
blackness
and
the
wild
flowers
wild
blossoms
and
weeds
well
known
to
her
that
would
not
let
her
memory
rest
and
were
wistful
of
what
had
been
and
she
thought
sisters
tend
the
flocks
my
mother
spinneth
with
the
maidens
of
the
tribe
my
father
hunteth
how
shall
i
come
among
them
but
strange
coldly
will
they
regard
me
i
shall
feel
them
shudder
when
they
take
me
to
their
bosoms
she
looked
on
ruark
to
speak
with
him
but
the
mouth
of
the
chief
was
set
and
white
and
even
while
she
looked
cries
of
treason
and
battle
arose
from
the
arabs
that
were
ahead
hidden
by
a
branching
wind
of
the
way
round
a
mountain
slant
then
the
eyes
of
the
chief
reddened
his
nostrils
grew
wide
and
the
darkness
of
his
face
was
as
flame
mixed
with
smoke
and
he
seized
bhanavar
and
hastened
onward
and
lo
yonder
were
his
men
overmatched
and
warriors
of
the
mountains
bursting
on
them
from
an
ambush
on
all
sides
ruark
leapt
in
his
seat
and
the
light
of
combat
was
on
him
and
he
dug
his
knees
into
his
mare
and
shouted
the
of
his
tribe
lifting
his
hands
as
it
were
to
draw
down
wrath
from
the
very
heavens
and
rushed
to
the
encounter
says
the
poet
hast
thou
seen
the
wild
herd
by
the
jungle
galloping
close
with
a
thunder
of
hooves
they
trample
what
heads
may
oppose
terribly
crushingly
onward
they
sweep
but
a
spring
from
the
reeds
and
the
panther
is
sprawling
in
air
and
with
muzzle
to
dust
and
black
beards
here
and
there
scatter
they
fly
track
with
blood
to
the
deep
such
was
the
onset
of
ruark
his
stroke
the
stroke
of
death
and
ere
the
echoes
had
ceased
rolling
from
that
cry
of
his
the
were
scattered
before
him
on
the
narrow
way
hurled
down
the
scrub
of
the
mountain
even
as
dead
leaves
and
loosened
stones
so
like
an
arm
of
lightning
was
the
chief
now
ruark
pursued
them
and
was
lost
to
bhanavar
round
a
slope
of
the
mountain
she
quickened
her
pace
to
mark
him
in
the
glory
of
the
battle
and
behold
a
sudden
darkness
enveloped
her
and
she
felt
herself
in
the
swathe
of
tightened
folds
clasped
in
an
arm
and
borne
rapidly
she
knew
not
whither
for
she
could
hear
and
see
nothing
it
was
to
her
as
were
she
speeding
constantly
downward
in
darkness
to
the
lower
realms
of
the
genii
of
the
caucasus
and
every
sense
and
even
that
of
fear
was
stunned
in
her
how
long
an
interval
had
elapsed
she
knew
not
when
the
folds
were
unwound
but
it
was
light
of
day
and
the
faces
of
men
and
they
were
warriors
that
were
about
her
warriors
of
the
mountain
but
of
ruark
and
his
arabs
no
voice
so
she
said
to
them
do
ye
with
me
and
one
among
them
that
was
a
youth
of
dignity
and
grace
and
a
countenance
like
morning
on
the
mountains
answered
will
of
rukrooth
o
lady
and
it
is
the
plight
of
him
we
bow
to
with
rukrooth
mother
of
the
she
cried
he
here
the
prince
that
i
may
speak
with
him
the
same
young
warrior
made
answer
so
forewarned
was
he
and
well
for
him
bhanavar
drew
her
robe
about
her
and
was
mute
ere
the
setting
of
the
moon
they
journeyed
on
with
her
and
continued
so
three
days
and
nights
through
the
defiles
and
ravines
and
matted
growths
of
the
mountains
on
the
fourth
dawn
they
were
on
the
summit
of
a
lofty
below
them
the
sun
shooting
a
current
of
gold
across
leagues
of
sea
then
he
that
had
spoken
with
bhanavar
said
sail
will
come
and
a
sail
came
from
under
the
sun
scarce
had
the
ship
grated
shore
when
the
warriors
lifted
bhanavar
and
waded
through
the
water
with
her
and
placed
her
unwetted
in
the
ship
and
one
the
fair
youth
among
the
warriors
sprang
on
board
with
her
remaining
by
her
so
the
captain
pushed
off
and
the
wind
filled
the
sails
and
bhanavar
was
borne
over
the
lustre
of
the
sea
that
was
as
a
changing
opal
in
its
lustre
even
as
a
melted
jewel
flowing
from
the
fingers
of
the
maker
the
almighty
one
the
ship
ceased
not
sailing
till
they
came
to
a
narrow
strait
where
the
sea
was
but
a
river
between
fair
sloping
hills
alight
with
towers
and
palaces
opening
a
way
to
a
great
city
that
was
in
its
radiance
over
the
waters
of
the
sea
as
the
aspect
of
myriad
sheeny
white
doves
breasting
the
wave
hitherto
the
young
warrior
had
held
aloof
in
coldness
of
courtesy
from
bhanavar
but
now
he
sat
by
her
and
said
bond
between
my
prince
and
rukrooth
is
accomplished
and
it
was
to
snatch
thee
from
the
chief
of
the
and
bring
thee
even
to
this
city
bhanavar
exclaimed
be
praised
in
all
things
and
his
will
be
done
the
youth
continued
art
alone
here
o
lady
exposed
to
the
perils
of
loneliness
surely
it
were
well
if
i
linger
with
thee
awhile
and
see
to
thy
welfare
in
this
city
even
as
a
brother
with
a
sister
and
i
will
deal
honourably
by
thee
bhanavar
looked
on
the
young
warrior
and
blushed
at
his
exceeding
sweetness
with
her
the
soft
freshness
of
his
voice
was
to
her
as
the
breeze
in
the
valleys
of
the
mountains
and
she
breathed
low
the
words
of
her
gratitude
saying
i
am
not
a
burden
let
this
be
so
then
said
he
me
by
my
name
which
is
almeryl
and
that
we
seem
indeed
of
one
kin
make
known
unto
me
thine
she
replied
is
it
this
name
of
bhanavar
the
youth
among
warriors
gazed
on
her
a
moment
with
the
fluttering
eye
of
bashfulness
and
said
they
that
have
marked
thee
call
thee
other
than
bhanavar
the
beautiful
she
remembered
that
ruark
had
spoken
in
like
manner
and
the
curse
of
her
beauty
smote
her
and
she
thought
fair
youth
he
hath
not
a
mother
to
watch
over
him
and
ward
off
souls
of
evil
i
dread
there
will
come
a
mishap
to
him
through
me
allah
shield
him
from
it
and
she
sought
to
dissuade
him
from
resting
by
her
but
he
cried
but
a
choice
to
dwell
with
thee
or
with
the
dogs
in
the
street
outside
thy
door
o
bhanavar
now
the
ship
sailed
close
up
to
the
quay
and
cast
anchor
there
in
the
midst
of
other
ships
of
merchandise
almeryl
then
threw
a
robe
over
his
mountain
dress
and
spoke
with
the
captain
apart
and
he
and
bhanavar
took
leave
of
the
captain
and
landed
on
the
quay
among
the
porters
and
of
these
one
stepped
forward
to
them
and
shouted
cheerily
be
the
burdens
and
the
bales
o
ye
fair
couple
fashioned
in
the
eye
of
elegant
proportions
ye
twin
male
and
female
wullahy
broad
is
the
back
of
your
servant
almeryl
beckoned
to
him
that
he
should
follow
them
and
he
followed
them
blessing
the
wind
that
had
brought
them
to
that
city
and
the
day
so
they
passed
through
the
streets
and
lanes
of
the
city
and
the
porter
pointed
out
this
house
and
that
house
wanting
an
occupant
and
almeryl
fixed
on
one
in
an
open
thoroughfare
that
had
before
it
a
and
behind
a
garden
with
fountains
and
flowers
and
shaded
by
trees
and
he
paid
down
the
half
of
its
price
and
had
it
furnished
before
nightfall
sumptuously
and
women
in
it
to
wait
on
bhanavar
and
stuffs
and
goods
and
scents
for
the
bath
all
luxuries
whatsoever
that
tradesmen
and
merchants
there
could
give
in
exchange
for
gold
then
almeryl
dismissed
the
porter
in
allah
name
and
gladdened
his
spirit
with
a
gift
over
the
due
of
his
hire
that
exalted
him
in
the
eyes
of
the
porter
and
the
porter
went
from
him
exclaiming
extremity
ukleet
is
thy
slave
and
he
sang
shouldst
thou
see
a
slim
youth
with
a
damsel
arriving
be
sure
is
the
hour
when
thy
fortune
is
thriving
a
generous
fee
makes
the
members
so
supple
that
over
the
world
they
could
carry
this
couple
now
so
it
was
that
the
youth
almeryl
and
the
damsel
bhanavar
abode
in
the
city
they
had
come
to
weeks
and
months
and
life
to
either
of
them
as
the
flowing
of
a
gentle
stream
even
as
brother
and
sister
lived
they
chastely
and
with
temperate
feasting
surely
the
youth
loved
her
with
a
great
love
and
the
heart
of
bhanavar
turned
not
from
him
and
was
won
utterly
by
his
gentleness
and
nobleness
and
devotion
and
they
relied
on
each
other
presence
for
any
joy
and
were
desolate
in
absence
as
the
poet
says
when
we
must
part
love
such
is
my
smart
love
sweetness
is
savourless
fairness
is
favourless
but
when
in
sight
love
we
two
unite
love
earth
has
no
sour
to
me
life
is
a
flower
to
me
and
with
the
increase
of
every
day
their
passion
increased
and
the
revealing
light
in
their
eyes
brightened
and
was
humid
as
is
sung
by
him
that
luted
to
the
rage
of
hearts
evens
star
yonder
comes
like
a
crown
on
us
larger
and
fonder
grows
its
orb
down
on
us
so
love
my
love
for
thee
blossoms
increasingly
so
sinks
it
in
the
sea
waxing
unceasingly
on
a
night
when
the
had
left
them
the
youth
could
contain
himself
no
more
and
caught
the
two
hands
of
bhanavar
in
his
saying
that
is
in
my
soul
for
thee
thou
knowest
o
bhanavar
and
is
spoken
when
i
move
and
when
i
breathe
o
my
loved
one
tell
me
then
the
cause
of
thy
shunning
me
whenever
i
would
speak
of
it
and
be
plain
with
thee
for
a
moment
bhanavar
sought
to
release
herself
from
his
hold
but
the
love
in
his
eyes
entangled
her
soul
as
in
a
net
and
she
sank
forward
to
him
and
sighed
under
his
chin
indeed
my
very
love
of
thee
that
made
me
the
twain
embraced
and
kissed
a
long
kiss
and
leaned
sideways
together
and
bhanavar
said
me
what
i
am
then
she
related
the
story
of
the
serpent
and
the
jewel
and
of
the
death
of
her
betrothed
when
it
was
ended
almeryl
cried
was
this
all
this
that
severed
us
and
he
said
what
i
am
so
he
told
bhanavar
how
rukrooth
the
mother
of
ruark
had
sent
messengers
to
the
prince
his
father
warning
him
of
the
passage
of
ruark
through
the
mountains
with
one
a
queen
of
serpents
a
sorceress
that
had
bewitched
him
and
enthralled
him
in
a
mighty
love
for
her
to
the
ruin
of
ruark
and
how
the
chief
was
on
his
way
with
her
to
demand
her
in
marriage
at
the
hands
of
her
parents
and
the
words
of
rukrooth
were
the
service
that
was
between
thee
and
my
husband
and
by
the
death
he
died
o
prince
rescue
the
chief
my
son
from
this
damsel
and
entrap
her
from
him
and
have
her
sent
even
to
the
city
of
the
inland
sea
for
no
less
a
distance
than
that
keepeth
ruark
from
her
and
almeryl
continued
questioned
the
messengers
myself
and
they
told
me
the
marvel
of
thy
loveliness
and
the
peril
to
him
that
looked
on
it
so
i
swore
there
was
no
power
should
keep
me
from
a
sight
of
thee
o
my
loved
one
my
prize
my
life
my
sleek
antelope
of
the
hills
surely
when
my
father
appointed
the
warriors
to
lie
in
wait
for
thy
coming
i
slipped
among
them
so
that
they
thought
it
ordered
by
him
i
should
head
them
the
rest
is
known
to
thee
o
my
fountain
of
blissfulness
but
the
treachery
to
ruark
was
the
treachery
of
ebn
asrac
not
of
such
warriors
as
we
and
i
would
have
fallen
on
ebn
asrac
had
not
ruark
so
routed
that
man
without
faith
was
all
as
i
have
said
blessed
be
allah
and
his
decrees
bhanavar
gazed
on
her
beloved
and
the
bridal
dew
overflowed
her
underlids
and
she
loosed
her
hair
to
let
it
flow
part
over
her
shoulders
part
over
his
and
in
sighs
that
were
the
measure
of
music
she
sang
i
thought
not
to
love
again
but
now
i
love
as
i
loved
not
before
i
love
not
i
adore
o
my
beloved
kiss
kiss
me
waste
thy
kisses
like
a
rain
are
not
thy
red
lips
fain
oh
and
so
softly
they
greet
am
i
not
sweet
sweet
must
i
be
for
thee
or
sweet
in
vain
sweet
to
thee
only
my
dear
love
the
lamps
and
censers
sink
but
can
not
cheat
these
eyes
of
thine
that
shoot
above
trembling
lustres
of
the
dove
a
darkness
drowns
all
lustres
still
i
see
thee
my
love
thee
thee
my
glory
of
gold
from
head
to
feet
oh
how
the
lids
of
the
world
close
quite
when
our
lips
meet
almeryl
strained
her
to
him
and
responded
my
life
was
midnight
on
the
mountain
side
cold
stars
were
on
the
heights
there
in
my
darkness
i
had
lived
and
died
content
with
nameless
lights
sudden
i
saw
the
heavens
flush
with
a
beam
and
i
ascended
soon
and
evermore
over
mankind
supreme
stood
silver
in
the
moon
and
he
fell
playfully
into
a
new
metre
singing
who
will
paint
my
beloved
in
musical
word
or
colour
earth
with
an
envy
is
moved
and
roses
she
brings
gems
from
the
green
fruits
with
the
fairy
feathers
of
paradise
hues
waters
with
falls
ore
from
the
all
in
their
splendour
approved
all
but
match
with
my
beloved
darker
and
denser
and
duller
then
she
kissed
him
for
that
song
and
sang
once
to
be
beautiful
was
my
pride
and
i
blush
in
love
with
my
own
bright
brow
once
when
a
wooer
was
by
my
side
i
worshipp
the
object
that
had
his
vow
different
different
different
now
different
now
is
my
beauty
to
me
different
different
different
now
for
i
prize
it
alone
because
prized
by
thee
almeryl
stretched
his
arm
to
the
lattice
and
drew
it
open
letting
in
the
soft
night
wind
and
the
sound
of
the
fountain
and
the
bulbul
and
the
beam
of
the
stars
and
versed
to
her
in
the
languor
of
deep
love
whether
we
die
or
we
live
matters
it
now
no
more
life
has
nought
further
to
give
love
is
its
crown
and
its
core
come
to
us
either
we
rife
death
or
life
death
can
take
not
away
darkness
and
light
are
the
same
we
are
beyond
the
pale
ray
wrapt
in
a
rosier
flame
welcome
which
will
to
our
breath
life
or
death
so
did
these
two
lovers
lute
and
sing
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
pouring
into
each
other
ears
melodies
from
the
new
sea
of
fancy
and
feeling
that
flowed
through
them
ere
they
ceased
their
sweet
interchange
of
tenderness
which
was
but
one
speech
from
one
soul
a
glow
of
light
ran
up
the
sky
and
the
edge
of
a
cloud
was
fired
and
in
the
blooming
of
dawn
almeryl
hung
over
bhanavar
and
his
heart
ached
to
see
the
freshness
of
her
wondrous
loveliness
and
he
sang
looking
on
her
the
rose
is
living
in
her
cheeks
the
lily
in
her
rounded
chin
she
speaks
but
when
her
whole
soul
speaks
and
then
the
two
flow
out
and
in
and
mix
their
red
and
white
to
make
the
hue
for
which
i
paradise
forsake
her
brow
from
her
black
falling
hair
ascends
like
morn
her
nose
is
clear
as
morning
hills
and
finely
fair
with
pearly
nostrils
curving
near
the
red
bow
of
her
upper
lip
her
bosom
the
white
wave
beneath
the
ship
the
fair
full
earth
the
enraptured
skies
she
images
in
constant
play
night
and
the
stars
are
in
her
eyes
but
her
sweet
face
is
beaming
day
a
bounteous
interblush
of
flowers
a
dewy
brilliance
in
a
dale
of
bowers
then
he
said
this
morning
shall
our
contract
of
marriage
be
written
and
witnessed
she
answered
my
lord
willeth
i
am
his
said
he
it
is
thy
desire
she
nestled
to
him
and
dinted
his
bare
arm
with
the
pearls
of
her
mouth
for
a
reply
so
that
morning
their
contract
of
marriage
was
written
and
witnessed
by
the
legal
number
of
witnesses
in
the
presence
of
the
cadi
with
his
license
on
it
endorsed
and
bhanavar
was
the
bride
of
almeryl
he
her
husband
never
was
youth
blessed
in
a
bride
like
that
youth
now
the
twain
lived
together
the
circle
of
a
full
year
of
delightful
marriage
and
love
lessened
not
in
them
but
was
as
the
love
of
the
first
day
little
cared
they
having
each
other
for
the
loneliness
of
their
dwelling
in
that
city
where
they
knew
none
save
the
porter
ukleet
who
went
about
their
commissions
sometimes
to
amuse
themselves
with
his
drolleries
they
sent
for
him
and
were
bountiful
with
him
and
made
him
drink
with
them
on
the
lawn
of
their
garden
leaning
to
an
inlet
of
the
sea
and
then
he
would
entertain
them
with
all
the
scandal
and
gossip
of
the
city
and
its
little
folk
and
great
when
he
was
outrageously
extravagant
in
these
stories
of
his
bhanavar
exclaimed
such
things
now
can
it
be
true
and
he
nodded
in
his
conceit
and
replied
loftily
certain
o
my
prince
and
princess
ye
be
from
the
mountains
unused
to
the
follies
and
dissipations
of
men
where
they
herd
and
ye
know
them
not
men
the
lamps
being
lit
in
the
garden
to
the
edges
of
the
water
where
they
lay
one
evening
ukleet
who
had
been
in
his
briskest
mood
became
grave
and
put
his
forefinger
to
the
side
of
his
nose
and
began
ye
aught
of
the
great
tidings
wullahy
no
other
than
the
departure
of
the
wife
of
boolp
the
broker
into
darkness
is
of
boolp
ye
hire
this
house
and
had
ye
a
hundred
houses
in
this
city
ye
might
have
had
them
from
boolp
the
broker
he
that
rich
and
glory
to
them
whom
allah
prospereth
say
i
and
i
mention
this
matter
for
is
certain
now
boolp
will
take
another
wife
to
him
to
comfort
him
for
there
be
two
things
beloved
of
boolp
and
therein
manifesteth
he
taste
and
the
discernment
of
excellence
and
what
is
approved
and
of
these
two
things
let
the
love
of
his
hoards
of
the
treasure
go
first
and
after
that
attachment
to
the
of
creation
the
fair
the
rapturous
even
to
them
so
by
this
see
ye
not
boolp
will
yearn
in
his
soul
for
another
spouse
now
o
ye
pair
what
a
chance
were
this
knew
ye
but
a
damsel
of
the
mountains
exquisite
in
symmetry
a
moon
to
enrapture
the
imagination
of
boolp
and
in
the
nature
of
things
herit
his
possessions
for
boolp
is
an
old
man
even
very
old
they
laughed
and
cried
know
not
of
such
a
damsel
and
the
broker
must
go
unmarried
for
us
when
next
ukleet
sat
before
them
almeryl
took
occasion
to
speak
of
boolp
again
and
said
broker
o
ukleet
is
he
also
a
lender
of
money
ukleet
replied
my
prince
he
is
or
he
is
not
is
of
the
maybes
i
wot
truly
boolp
is
one
that
baiteth
the
hook
of
an
emergency
the
brows
of
the
prince
were
downcast
and
he
said
no
more
but
on
the
following
morning
he
left
bhanavar
early
under
a
pretext
and
sallied
forth
from
the
house
of
their
abode
alone
since
their
union
in
that
city
they
had
not
been
once
apart
and
bhanavar
grieved
and
thought
his
love
for
me
and
she
called
her
women
to
her
and
dressed
in
this
dress
and
that
dress
and
was
satisfied
with
none
the
dews
of
the
bath
stood
cold
upon
her
and
she
trembled
and
fled
from
mirror
to
mirror
and
in
each
she
was
the
same
surpassing
vision
of
loveliness
then
her
women
held
a
glass
to
her
and
she
examined
herself
closely
if
there
might
be
a
fleck
upon
her
anywhere
and
all
was
as
the
snow
of
the
mountains
on
her
round
limbs
sloping
in
the
curves
of
harmony
and
the
faint
rose
of
the
dawn
on
slants
of
snow
was
their
hue
twining
her
fingers
and
sighing
she
thought
is
not
that
he
can
not
but
think
me
beautiful
she
smiled
a
melancholy
smile
at
her
image
in
the
glass
exclaiming
availeth
it
thy
beauty
for
he
is
away
and
looketh
not
on
thee
thou
vain
thing
and
what
of
thy
loveliness
if
the
light
illumine
it
not
for
he
is
the
light
to
thee
and
it
is
darkness
when
he
away
suddenly
she
thought
that
which
needeth
to
light
it
no
other
light
i
had
forgotten
it
in
my
bliss
the
jewel
then
she
went
to
a
case
of
where
she
kept
the
jewel
and
drew
it
forth
and
shone
in
the
beam
of
a
pleasant
imagination
thinking
surprise
him
and
she
robed
herself
in
a
robe
of
saffron
and
set
lesser
gems
of
the
diamond
and
the
emerald
in
the
braid
of
her
hair
and
knotted
the
serpent
jewel
firmly
in
a
band
of
tissue
and
had
it
woven
in
her
hair
among
the
braids
in
this
array
she
awaited
his
coming
and
pleased
her
mind
with
picturing
his
astonishment
and
the
joy
that
would
be
his
mute
were
the
women
who
waited
on
her
for
in
their
lives
they
had
seen
no
such
sight
as
bhanavar
beneath
the
beams
of
the
jewel
and
the
whole
chamber
was
aglow
with
her
now
in
her
anxiety
she
sent
them
one
and
one
repeatedly
to
look
forth
at
the
window
for
the
coming
of
the
prince
so
when
he
came
not
she
went
herself
to
look
forth
and
stretched
her
white
neck
beyond
the
casement
while
her
head
was
exposed
she
heard
a
cry
of
some
one
from
the
house
in
the
street
opposite
and
bhanavar
beheld
in
the
house
of
the
broker
an
old
wrinkled
fellow
that
gesticulated
to
her
in
a
frenzy
she
snatched
her
veil
down
and
drew
in
her
head
in
anger
at
him
calling
to
her
maids
is
yonder
hideous
old
dotard
and
they
answered
laughing
indeed
boolp
the
broker
o
fair
mistress
and
mighty
to
divert
herself
she
made
them
tell
her
of
boolp
and
they
told
her
a
thousand
anecdotes
of
the
broker
and
verses
of
him
and
the
constancy
of
his
amorous
condition
and
his
greediness
and
bhanavar
was
beguiled
of
her
impatience
till
it
was
evening
and
the
prince
returned
to
her
so
they
embraced
and
she
greeted
him
as
usual
waiting
what
he
would
say
searching
his
countenance
for
a
token
of
wonderment
but
the
youth
knew
not
that
aught
was
added
to
her
beauty
for
he
looked
nowhere
save
in
her
eyes
bhanavar
was
nigh
weeping
with
vexation
and
pushed
him
from
her
and
chid
him
with
lack
of
love
and
weariness
of
her
and
the
eye
of
the
prince
rose
to
her
brow
to
read
it
and
he
saw
the
jewel
almeryl
clapped
his
hands
crying
and
this
thy
surprise
for
me
my
fond
one
beloved
of
mine
then
he
gazed
on
her
a
space
and
said
thou
thou
art
terrible
in
thy
beauty
bhanavar
and
hast
the
face
of
lightning
under
that
jewel
of
the
serpent
she
kissed
him
whispering
lightning
to
thee
yet
lovest
thou
bhanavar
he
replied
so
and
all
save
bhanavar
in
this
world
is
the
darkness
of
oblivion
to
me
when
it
was
the
next
morning
almeryl
rose
to
go
forth
again
ere
he
had
passed
the
curtain
of
the
chamber
bhanavar
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
she
was
trembling
violently
her
visage
was
a
wild
inquiry
goest
and
again
there
is
something
hidden
from
me
almeryl
took
her
to
his
heart
and
caressed
her
with
fond
flatteries
saying
but
what
is
beating
under
these
two
pomegranates
and
thou
learnest
all
of
me
but
she
stamped
her
foot
crying
no
i
will
hear
it
there
a
mystery
so
he
said
then
it
is
this
only
small
matter
enough
i
have
a
business
with
the
captain
of
the
vessel
that
brought
us
hither
and
i
must
see
him
ere
he
setteth
sail
no
other
than
that
thou
jealous
watchful
star
pierce
me
with
thine
eyes
it
is
no
other
than
that
she
levelled
her
lids
at
him
till
her
lustrous
black
eyelashes
were
as
arrows
and
mimicked
him
softly
other
than
that
and
he
replied
so
then
she
clung
to
him
like
a
hungry
creature
repeating
so
and
let
him
go
alone
she
summoned
a
slave
a
black
and
bade
him
fetch
to
her
without
delay
ukleet
the
porter
and
the
porter
was
presently
ushered
in
to
her
protesting
service
and
devotion
so
she
questioned
him
of
almeryl
and
the
prince
business
abroad
what
he
knew
of
it
ukleet
commenced
reciting
verses
on
the
ills
of
jealousy
but
bhanavar
checked
him
with
an
eye
that
ukleet
had
seen
never
before
in
woman
or
in
man
and
he
gaped
at
her
helplessly
as
one
that
has
swallowed
a
bone
she
laughed
crying
o
thou
fellow
to
answer
my
like
by
the
letter
now
what
she
heard
from
ukleet
when
he
had
recovered
his
wits
was
that
the
prince
had
a
business
with
none
save
the
lenders
of
money
so
she
spake
to
ukleet
in
a
kindly
tone
art
mine
to
serve
me
he
was
as
one
fascinated
and
delivered
himself
o
my
mistress
with
whatso
pleaseth
thy
sweet
presence
said
she
over
to
the
broker
opposite
and
bring
him
hither
to
me
ukleet
departed
saying
hear
is
to
obey
she
sat
gazing
on
the
jewel
and
its
counterchanging
splendours
in
her
hand
and
the
thought
of
almeryl
and
his
necessity
was
her
only
thought
not
ten
minutes
of
the
hour
had
passed
before
the
women
waiting
on
her
announced
ukleet
and
the
broker
boolp
bhanavar
gave
little
heed
to
the
old
fellow
grimaces
and
the
compliments
he
addressed
her
but
handed
him
the
jewel
and
desired
his
valuation
of
its
worth
the
face
of
boolp
was
a
keen
edge
when
he
regarded
bhanavar
but
the
sight
of
the
jewel
sharpened
it
tenfold
and
he
tossed
his
arms
exclaiming
jewel
this
so
bhanavar
cried
to
him
a
price
for
it
o
thou
broker
and
boolp
the
old
miser
debated
and
began
prating
lady
the
soul
of
thy
slave
is
abashed
by
a
double
beam
this
the
jewel
of
jewels
thou
truly
of
thy
sex
and
saving
thee
there
no
jewel
of
worth
like
this
one
and
together
ye
be
wullahy
never
felt
i
aught
like
this
since
my
espousal
of
soolka
that
gone
and
was
nothing
like
it
then
now
o
my
princess
confess
it
freely
this
is
but
a
pretext
this
valuation
of
the
jewel
and
ukleet
our
and
leave
the
rewarding
of
him
to
me
wullahy
i
can
be
generous
and
my
days
of
favour
with
fair
ladies
be
not
yet
over
blessed
be
allah
for
this
day
and
thinkest
thou
those
eyes
fell
on
me
with
discriminating
observation
ere
my
sense
of
perception
was
struck
by
thee
not
so
for
i
had
noted
thee
o
moon
of
hearts
from
my
window
yonder
in
this
fashion
boolp
the
broker
went
on
prating
and
bowing
and
screwing
the
corners
of
his
little
acid
eyes
to
wink
the
wink
of
common
accord
between
himself
and
bhanavar
meantime
she
had
spoken
aside
to
one
of
her
women
and
a
second
black
slave
entered
the
chamber
bearing
in
his
hand
a
twisted
scourge
and
that
slave
laid
it
on
the
back
of
boolp
the
broker
and
by
this
means
he
was
brought
quickly
to
the
valuation
of
the
jewel
then
he
named
a
sum
that
was
a
great
sum
but
not
the
value
of
the
jewel
to
the
fiftieth
part
nay
nor
the
hundredth
part
of
its
value
and
ukleet
remonstrated
with
him
but
he
was
resolute
saying
that
sum
leaves
me
a
beggar
so
bhanavar
said
desire
is
for
immediate
payment
of
the
money
and
the
jewel
is
thine
for
that
sum
now
the
broker
went
to
fetch
the
money
and
returned
with
it
in
bags
of
gold
the
amount
and
bags
of
silver
and
the
remainder
in
writing
made
due
at
a
certain
period
for
payment
and
he
groaned
and
handed
her
the
money
and
took
the
jewel
in
his
hands
ejaculating
the
name
of
allah
that
evening
when
it
was
dark
and
the
lamps
lit
in
the
chamber
and
the
wine
set
and
the
nosegay
almeryl
asked
of
bhanavar
to
see
her
under
the
light
of
the
jewel
she
warded
him
with
an
excuse
but
he
was
earnest
with
her
so
she
feigned
that
he
teased
her
saying
that
thou
art
no
longer
content
with
me
as
i
am
o
my
husband
then
she
said
thou
successful
in
thy
dealings
this
day
his
arm
slackened
round
her
and
he
answered
nothing
so
she
cried
on
thee
thou
foolish
one
and
what
is
thy
need
of
running
over
this
city
know
i
not
thy
case
and
thine
occasion
o
my
beloved
surely
i
am
queen
of
serpents
a
mistress
of
enchantments
a
diviner
of
things
hidden
and
i
know
thee
here
then
is
what
thou
requirest
and
conceal
not
from
me
thy
necessity
another
time
my
husband
upon
that
she
pointed
his
eye
to
the
of
gold
and
of
silver
almeryl
was
amazed
and
asked
her
came
these
for
i
was
at
the
last
extremity
without
coin
of
any
kind
she
answered
but
by
the
serpents
and
he
exclaimed
that
i
might
work
as
that
porter
worketh
rather
than
this
now
seeing
he
bewailed
her
use
of
the
powers
of
the
jewel
bhanavar
fell
between
his
arms
and
related
to
him
her
discovery
of
his
condition
and
how
she
disposed
of
the
jewel
to
the
broker
and
of
the
scourging
of
boolp
and
he
praised
her
and
clave
to
her
and
they
laughed
and
delighted
their
souls
in
plenteousness
and
bliss
was
their
portion
as
the
poet
says
bliss
that
is
born
of
mutual
esteem
and
tried
companionship
i
truly
deem
a
palace
wherein
fountains
rise
from
springs
that
have
their
sources
in
the
skies
so
were
they
for
awhile
it
happened
that
one
day
that
was
the
last
day
of
the
year
since
her
wearing
of
the
jewel
ukleet
said
to
them
wary
the
vizier
aswarak
hath
his
eye
on
you
and
it
is
no
cool
one
i
say
nothing
the
wise
are
discreet
in
their
tellings
of
the
great
is
certain
the
broker
boolp
forgetteth
not
his
treatment
here
they
smiled
turning
to
each
other
and
said
live
innocently
we
harm
no
one
what
should
we
fear
during
the
night
of
that
day
bhanavar
awoke
and
kissed
the
prince
and
lo
he
shuddered
in
his
sleep
as
with
the
a
second
time
she
was
awakened
on
the
breast
of
almeryl
by
a
dream
of
the
serpents
of
the
lake
karatis
the
lake
of
the
jewel
and
she
stood
up
and
there
was
in
the
street
a
hum
of
voices
and
she
saw
there
before
the
house
armed
men
with
naked
steel
in
their
hands
scarce
had
she
called
almeryl
to
her
when
the
outer
door
of
their
house
was
forced
and
she
shrieked
to
him
thou
they
come
for
fly
o
my
prince
my
husband
the
way
of
the
garden
is
clear
but
he
said
sadly
what
am
i
it
is
thou
they
would
win
from
me
i
leave
thee
not
in
this
life
so
she
cried
my
soul
then
together
but
i
shall
hinder
thee
and
be
a
burden
to
thy
flight
and
she
called
on
the
for
aid
and
ran
with
him
into
the
garden
of
the
house
and
lo
by
the
water
side
at
the
end
of
the
garden
a
boat
full
of
armed
soldiers
with
scimitars
so
these
fell
upon
them
and
bound
them
and
haled
them
into
the
house
again
where
was
the
dark
vizier
aswarak
and
certain
officers
of
the
night
watch
with
a
force
the
vizier
cried
when
he
saw
them
accuse
thee
prince
almeryl
of
being
here
in
the
city
of
our
lord
the
king
to
conspire
against
him
and
his
authority
almeryl
faced
the
vizier
firmly
and
replied
knew
not
in
my
life
i
had
made
an
enemy
but
there
is
one
here
who
telleth
that
of
me
the
vizier
frowned
saying
deniest
this
and
thou
here
and
thy
father
at
war
with
the
sovereignty
of
our
lord
the
king
almeryl
beheld
his
danger
and
he
said
this
so
then
cried
the
vizier
him
is
not
that
a
fair
simulation
so
he
called
to
the
guard
him
when
that
was
done
he
ordered
the
house
to
be
sacked
and
the
women
and
the
slaves
he
divided
for
a
spoil
but
he
reserved
bhanavar
to
himself
and
lo
twice
she
burst
away
from
them
that
held
her
to
hang
upon
the
lips
of
almeryl
and
twice
was
she
torn
from
him
as
a
is
torn
from
the
streaming
vine
and
the
third
time
she
swooned
and
the
anguish
of
life
left
her
now
bhanavar
was
borne
to
the
harem
of
the
vizier
and
for
days
she
suffered
no
morsel
of
food
to
enter
her
mouth
and
was
dying
had
not
the
vizier
in
the
cunning
of
his
dissimulation
fed
her
with
distant
glimpses
of
almeryl
to
show
her
he
yet
lived
then
she
thought
my
beloved
liveth
life
is
due
to
me
and
she
ate
and
drank
and
reassumed
her
fair
fulness
and
the
queenliness
that
was
hers
but
the
vizier
had
no
love
of
her
and
respected
her
considering
in
his
mind
will
exhaust
the
fury
of
this
tigress
and
she
is
a
fruit
worth
the
waiting
for
wullahy
i
shall
have
possessed
her
ere
the
days
of
ripening
there
was
in
the
harem
of
the
vizier
a
that
had
been
brought
there
in
her
childhood
and
trained
to
play
upon
the
lute
and
accompany
her
voice
with
the
instrument
to
this
little
damsel
bhanavar
gave
her
heart
and
would
listen
all
day
as
in
a
trance
to
her
luting
till
the
desire
to
escape
from
that
bondage
and
gather
tidings
of
almeryl
mastered
her
and
she
persuaded
one
of
the
blacks
of
the
harem
with
a
bribe
to
procure
her
an
interview
with
the
porter
ukleet
so
at
a
certain
hour
of
the
night
ukleet
was
introduced
into
the
garden
of
the
harem
and
he
was
in
the
darkness
of
that
garden
a
porter
with
knees
that
knocked
the
together
but
bhanavar
strengthened
his
soul
and
he
said
to
her
the
doing
of
boolp
the
broker
and
he
whispered
the
vizier
of
thee
and
thy
beauty
o
my
mistress
surely
thy
punishment
and
this
ruin
is
but
part
payment
to
boolp
of
the
price
of
the
jewel
the
great
jewel
that
in
the
hands
of
the
vizier
then
she
questioned
him
almeryl
the
prince
my
husband
what
of
him
ukleet
was
dumb
and
bhanavar
asked
to
hear
no
more
surely
she
was
at
the
gates
of
pale
spirits
within
an
hour
of
her
interview
with
ukleet
and
there
was
no
blessedness
for
her
save
in
death
the
stiffer
of
ills
the
drug
that
is
infallible
as
is
said
dark
is
that
last
stage
of
sorrow
which
from
death
alone
can
borrow
comfort
bhanavar
would
have
died
then
but
in
a
certain
pause
of
her
fever
the
vizier
stood
by
her
she
looked
at
him
long
as
she
lay
and
the
life
in
her
large
eyes
was
ebbing
away
slowly
but
there
seemed
presently
a
check
as
an
eddy
comes
in
the
stream
and
the
light
of
intelligence
flowed
like
a
reviving
fire
into
her
eyes
and
her
heart
quickened
with
desire
of
life
while
she
looked
on
the
vizier
so
she
passed
the
pitch
of
that
fever
and
bloomed
anew
in
her
beauty
and
cherished
it
for
she
had
a
purpose
now
there
was
rejoicing
in
the
harem
of
the
vizier
aswarak
when
bhanavar
arose
from
the
couch
and
the
vizier
exulted
thinking
have
tamed
this
wild
beauty
or
she
had
reached
death
in
that
extremity
so
he
allowed
bhanavar
greater
freedom
and
indulgences
and
bhanavar
feigned
to
give
her
soul
to
the
pleasures
women
delight
in
and
the
vizier
buried
her
in
gems
and
trinkets
and
costly
raiment
robes
of
exquisite
silks
the
choicest
of
samarcand
and
china
and
he
permitted
her
to
make
purchases
among
certain
of
the
warehouses
of
the
city
and
the
shops
of
the
tradesmen
jewellers
and
others
so
that
she
went
about
as
she
would
but
for
the
slaves
that
attended
her
and
the
overseer
of
the
harem
this
continued
and
aswarak
became
urgent
with
her
and
to
remove
suspicion
from
him
she
named
a
day
from
that
period
when
she
would
be
his
meantime
she
contrived
to
see
ukleet
the
porter
frequently
and
within
a
week
of
her
engagement
with
the
vizier
she
gazed
from
a
of
the
harem
and
beheld
in
the
garden
by
the
beams
of
the
moon
ukleet
and
he
was
looking
as
on
the
watch
for
her
so
she
sent
to
him
the
little
she
loved
but
ukleet
would
tell
her
nothing
then
went
she
herself
greeting
him
graciously
for
his
service
was
other
than
that
of
ukleet
said
lady
mistress
of
hearts
moon
of
the
tides
of
will
is
certain
i
was
thy
slave
from
the
hour
i
beheld
thee
first
and
of
the
prince
thy
husband
allah
rest
his
soul
now
these
be
my
tidings
wullahy
the
king
is
one
maddened
with
the
reports
i
spread
about
of
thy
beauty
yea
raging
and
i
have
a
friend
in
his
palace
even
an
acute
in
the
interpreting
of
wishes
there
was
he
always
gabbling
of
thy
case
o
my
princess
till
the
seized
hold
on
it
and
so
it
went
to
the
chamberlain
thence
to
the
chief
of
the
eunuchs
and
from
him
in
a
natural
course
to
the
king
now
from
the
king
the
tracking
of
this
tale
went
to
the
down
again
and
from
him
to
me
so
was
i
summoned
to
the
king
and
the
king
discoursed
with
me
i
with
him
in
fair
fluency
he
in
ejaculations
of
desire
to
have
sight
of
thee
i
in
expatiation
on
that
he
would
see
when
he
had
his
desire
now
in
this
have
i
not
done
thee
a
service
o
sovereign
of
fancies
bhanavar
mused
and
said
the
i
pass
through
the
city
to
make
a
selection
of
goods
and
i
shall
pass
at
noon
by
the
great
mosque
on
my
way
to
the
shop
of
ebn
roulchook
the
king
jeweller
beyond
the
of
a
surety
i
know
not
how
my
lord
the
king
may
see
me
said
the
porter
enough
on
my
head
be
it
and
he
went
from
her
singing
the
song
how
little
a
thing
serves
fortune
turn
when
she
intent
on
doing
how
easily
the
world
may
burn
when
kings
come
out
now
ere
she
set
forth
on
the
to
make
her
purchases
bhanavar
sent
word
to
the
vizier
aswarak
that
she
would
see
him
and
he
came
to
her
drunken
with
alacrity
for
he
augured
favourably
that
her
reluctance
was
melting
toward
him
so
she
said
my
master
my
time
of
mourning
is
at
an
end
and
i
would
look
well
before
thee
even
as
one
worthy
of
being
thy
bride
so
bestow
on
me
i
pray
thee
for
my
wearing
that
day
the
jewels
that
be
in
thy
treasury
the
brightest
and
clearest
of
them
and
the
largest
the
vizier
aswarak
replied
and
he
was
one
in
great
satisfaction
of
soul
that
i
have
are
thine
wullahy
and
one
a
marvel
that
i
bought
of
boolp
the
broker
that
had
it
from
an
african
merchant
so
he
commanded
the
box
wherein
he
had
deposited
the
jewel
to
be
brought
to
him
there
in
the
chamber
of
bhanavar
and
took
forth
the
serpent
jewel
between
his
forefinger
and
thumb
and
laughed
at
the
eager
eyes
of
bhanavar
when
she
beheld
it
saying
thine
thy
bridal
gift
the
day
i
possess
thee
bhanavar
trembled
at
the
sight
of
the
jewel
and
its
redness
was
to
her
as
the
blood
of
zurvan
and
almeryl
she
stretched
her
hand
out
for
it
and
cried
day
o
my
lord
make
it
mine
so
the
vizier
said
what
i
have
spoken
will
i
keep
to
it
has
cost
me
much
bhanavar
looked
at
him
and
uttered
in
a
soft
tone
it
has
cost
thee
much
then
she
exclaimed
as
in
play
me
how
i
look
by
its
beam
and
in
her
guile
she
snatched
the
jewel
from
him
and
held
it
to
her
brow
then
aswarak
started
from
her
and
feared
her
for
the
red
light
of
the
jewel
glowed
and
darkened
the
chamber
with
its
beam
darkening
all
save
the
lustre
that
was
on
the
visage
of
bhanavar
he
shouted
this
art
thou
a
sorceress
she
removed
the
jewel
and
ceased
glaring
on
him
and
said
but
thy
poor
slave
then
he
coaxed
her
to
give
him
the
jewel
and
she
would
not
he
commanded
her
peremptorily
and
she
hesitated
so
he
grasped
her
tightened
hand
and
his
face
loured
with
wrath
yet
she
withheld
the
jewel
from
him
laughing
and
he
was
stirred
to
extreme
wrath
and
drew
from
his
girdle
the
naked
scimitar
and
menaced
her
with
it
and
he
looked
mighty
but
she
dreaded
him
little
and
stood
her
full
height
before
him
daring
him
and
she
was
as
the
tigress
defending
a
cub
from
a
wilder
beast
now
when
he
was
about
to
call
in
the
armed
slaves
of
the
palace
she
said
warn
thee
vizier
aswarak
tempt
me
not
to
match
them
that
serve
me
with
them
that
serve
thee
he
ground
his
teeth
in
fury
crying
conspiracy
and
in
the
harem
now
thou
traitress
the
logic
of
the
lash
shall
be
tried
upon
thee
and
he
roared
ye
without
there
ho
but
ere
the
slaves
had
entered
bhanavar
rubbed
the
jewel
on
her
bosom
muttering
have
forborne
till
now
now
will
i
have
a
sacrifice
though
i
be
it
and
rubbing
the
jewel
she
sang
hither
hither
come
to
your
queen
come
through
the
grey
wall
come
through
the
green
there
was
heard
a
noise
like
the
noise
of
a
wind
coming
down
a
narrow
gorge
above
falling
waters
a
hissing
and
a
rushing
of
wings
and
behold
bhanavar
was
circled
by
rings
and
rings
of
that
glowed
round
her
twisted
each
in
each
with
the
fierceness
of
fire
she
like
a
flame
rising
up
white
in
the
midst
of
them
the
black
slaves
when
they
had
lifted
the
curtain
of
the
shrieked
to
see
her
and
aswarak
crouched
at
her
feet
with
the
aspect
of
an
angry
beast
carved
in
stone
then
bhanavar
loosed
on
either
of
the
slaves
a
serpent
saying
these
have
seen
they
shall
not
say
and
while
the
sweat
dropped
heavily
from
the
forehead
of
aswarak
she
stepped
out
of
the
circle
of
serpents
singing
over
over
hie
to
the
lake
sleep
with
the
left
eye
keep
the
right
awake
then
the
serpents
spread
with
a
great
whirr
and
flew
through
the
high
window
and
the
walls
as
they
had
come
and
she
said
to
the
vizier
now
fearest
thou
i
have
spared
thee
thou
that
madest
me
desolate
and
thy
slaves
are
a
sacrifice
for
thee
now
this
i
ask
where
lies
my
beloved
the
prince
my
husband
speak
nothing
of
him
save
the
place
of
his
burial
so
he
told
her
the
of
the
great
prison
she
rolled
her
eyes
on
the
vizier
darkly
exclaiming
where
the
felons
lie
entombed
he
lieth
and
she
began
to
pant
pale
with
what
she
had
done
and
leaned
to
the
floor
and
called
yellow
stripe
with
freckle
red
coil
and
curl
and
watch
by
my
head
and
a
serpent
with
yellow
stripes
and
red
freckles
came
like
a
javelin
down
to
her
and
coiled
and
curled
round
her
head
and
she
slept
an
hour
when
she
arose
the
vizier
was
yet
there
sitting
with
folded
knees
so
she
sped
the
serpent
to
the
lake
karatis
and
called
her
women
to
her
and
went
to
an
inner
room
and
drew
an
outer
robe
and
a
vest
over
that
she
had
on
and
passed
the
vizier
and
said
thou
not
rejoiced
in
thy
bride
o
aswarak
was
a
wondrous
clemency
hers
now
but
four
more
days
and
thou
claimest
her
say
nothing
of
what
thou
hast
seen
or
thou
wilt
shortly
see
nothing
further
to
say
my
master
so
she
left
the
vizier
sitting
still
in
that
chamber
and
mounted
a
mule
attended
by
slaves
on
foot
before
and
behind
her
and
passed
through
the
streets
till
she
came
to
the
shop
of
ebn
roulchook
the
king
was
in
disguise
at
the
extremity
of
the
shop
and
while
she
examined
this
and
that
of
the
precious
stones
bhanavar
for
a
moment
made
bare
the
beauty
of
her
face
and
love
fires
took
fast
hold
of
the
king
and
he
cried
marvel
not
at
the
eloquence
of
the
porter
now
she
made
ebn
roulchook
bring
to
her
a
circlet
of
gold
with
a
hollow
in
the
frontal
centre
and
fit
into
that
hollow
the
serpent
jewel
so
while
she
laughed
and
chatted
with
her
women
bhanavar
lifted
the
circlet
and
made
her
countenance
wholly
bare
even
to
the
neck
and
the
beginning
slope
of
the
bosom
and
fixed
the
circlet
to
her
head
with
the
jewel
burning
on
her
brow
then
when
he
beheld
the
glory
of
excelling
loveliness
that
she
was
and
the
splendour
in
her
eyes
under
the
jewel
the
king
shouted
and
parted
with
his
disguise
and
ebn
roulchook
and
the
women
and
slaves
with
bhanavar
fled
to
the
courtyard
that
was
behind
the
shop
leaving
bhanavar
alone
with
the
king
surely
bhanavar
returned
not
to
the
dwelling
of
the
vizier
now
the
king
mashalleed
espoused
bhanavar
and
she
became
his
queen
and
ruled
him
and
her
word
was
the
dictate
of
the
land
then
caused
she
the
body
of
almeryl
with
the
severed
head
of
the
prince
to
be
disinterred
and
entombed
secretly
in
the
palace
and
she
had
lamps
lit
in
the
vault
and
the
pall
spread
and
the
readers
of
the
koran
to
read
by
the
tomb
and
then
she
stole
to
the
tomb
hourly
in
the
day
and
in
the
night
wailing
of
him
and
her
utter
misery
repeating
verses
at
the
side
of
the
tomb
and
they
were
take
me
to
thee
like
the
tree
my
life
is
half
in
earth
and
draws
thence
all
sweetness
oh
may
my
being
pause
soon
beside
thee
welcome
me
soon
as
to
the
queenly
moon
man
homage
to
my
beauty
sets
yet
am
i
a
budding
regrets
welcome
me
soon
soul
of
my
soul
have
me
not
half
but
whole
dear
dust
thou
art
my
eyes
my
breath
draw
me
to
thee
down
the
dark
sea
of
death
soul
of
my
soul
and
she
sang
sad
are
they
who
drink
life
cup
till
they
have
come
to
the
better
at
once
to
toss
it
up
and
trample
it
beneath
the
feet
for
as
serpents
eggs
is
then
and
knows
not
other
change
early
early
early
have
i
reached
the
dregs
of
life
and
loathe
and
love
the
bittersweet
revenge
then
turned
she
aside
and
sang
musingly
i
came
to
his
arms
like
the
flower
of
the
spring
and
he
was
my
bird
of
the
radiant
wing
he
flutter
above
me
a
moment
and
won
the
bliss
of
my
breast
as
a
beam
of
the
sun
untouch
and
untasted
till
then
the
voice
in
her
throat
was
like
a
drowning
creature
and
she
rose
up
and
chanted
wildly
i
weep
again
what
play
is
this
for
the
thing
is
dead
in
me
long
since
will
all
the
reviving
rain
of
heaven
bring
me
back
my
prince
but
i
when
i
weep
when
i
weep
blood
will
i
weep
and
when
i
weep
sons
for
fathers
shall
weep
mothers
for
sons
shall
weep
wives
for
husbands
shall
weep
earth
shall
complain
of
floods
red
and
deep
when
i
weep
upon
that
she
ran
up
a
secret
passage
to
her
chamber
and
rubbed
the
jewel
and
called
the
serpents
to
delight
her
soul
with
the
sight
of
her
power
and
rolled
and
sported
madly
among
them
clutching
them
by
the
necks
till
their
thin
little
red
tongues
hung
out
and
their
eyes
were
as
discoloured
blisters
of
venom
then
she
arose
and
her
arms
and
neck
and
lips
were
glazed
with
the
slime
of
the
serpents
and
she
flung
off
her
robes
to
the
silken
inner
vest
looped
across
her
bosom
with
pearls
and
whirled
in
a
mazy
among
them
and
sang
melancholy
melodies
making
them
delirious
fascinating
them
and
they
followed
her
round
and
round
in
twines
and
twists
and
curves
with
arched
heads
and
stiffened
tails
and
the
chamber
swam
like
an
undulating
sea
of
shifting
sapphire
lit
by
the
moon
of
midnight
not
before
the
moon
of
midnight
was
in
the
sky
ceased
bhanavar
sporting
with
the
serpents
and
she
sank
to
sleep
exhausted
in
their
midst
such
was
the
occupation
of
the
queen
of
mashalleed
when
he
came
not
to
her
the
women
and
slaves
of
the
palace
dreaded
her
and
the
king
himself
was
her
very
slave
meanwhile
the
plot
of
her
unforgivingness
against
aswarak
ripened
and
the
vizier
beholding
the
bride
he
had
lost
queen
of
mashalleed
his
master
it
was
as
she
conceived
that
his
heart
was
eaten
with
jealousy
and
fierce
rage
bhanavar
as
she
came
across
him
spake
mildly
and
gave
him
gentle
looks
sad
glances
suffering
not
his
fires
to
abate
the
torment
of
his
love
to
cool
each
night
he
awoke
with
a
serpent
in
his
bed
the
beam
of
her
beauty
was
as
the
constant
bite
of
a
serpent
poisoning
his
blood
and
he
deluded
his
soul
with
the
belief
that
bhanavar
loved
him
notwithstanding
and
that
she
was
seized
forcibly
from
him
by
the
king
thought
he
loosed
she
not
a
serpent
from
the
host
to
strangle
me
even
as
yonder
black
slaves
bhanavar
knew
the
mind
of
aswarak
and
considered
king
is
cunning
and
weak
a
slave
to
his
desires
and
in
the
bondage
of
the
jewel
my
beauty
the
vizier
is
unscrupulous
a
hatcher
of
intrigues
but
that
he
dreads
me
and
hopes
a
favour
of
me
he
would
have
wrought
against
me
ere
now
is
then
a
combat
him
and
me
o
my
soul
art
thou
dreaming
of
a
fair
youth
that
was
the
bliss
of
thy
bosom
night
and
day
night
and
day
the
vizier
shall
die
one
morning
and
it
was
a
year
from
the
day
she
had
become
queen
of
mashalleed
bhanavar
sprang
up
quickly
from
the
side
of
the
king
and
he
was
gazing
on
her
in
amazement
and
loathing
she
flew
to
her
chamber
chasing
forth
her
women
and
ran
to
a
mirror
therein
she
saw
three
lines
that
were
on
her
brow
lines
of
age
and
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
and
about
her
throat
a
slackness
of
skin
the
skin
no
longer
its
soft
rosy
white
but
withered
brown
as
leaves
of
the
forest
she
shrieked
and
fell
back
in
a
swoon
of
horror
when
she
recovered
she
ran
to
the
mirror
again
and
it
was
the
same
sight
and
she
rose
from
swooning
a
third
time
and
still
she
beheld
the
visage
of
a
hag
nothing
of
beauty
there
save
the
hair
and
the
brilliant
eyes
then
summoned
she
the
serpents
in
a
circle
and
the
number
of
them
was
that
of
the
days
in
the
year
and
she
bared
her
wrist
and
seized
one
a
with
sapphire
spots
and
hissed
at
him
till
he
hissed
and
foam
whitened
the
lips
of
each
thereupon
she
cried
and
throat
of
hell
what
is
come
upon
me
tell
and
the
serpent
replied
jewel
queen
beauty
price
is
the
time
for
sacrifice
she
grasped
another
one
of
leaden
colour
with
yellow
bars
and
silver
crescents
and
cried
and
throat
of
fire
name
the
creature
ye
require
and
the
serpent
replied
ruby
lip
poison
tooth
we
are
hungry
for
a
youth
she
grasped
another
that
writhed
in
her
fingers
like
liquid
emerald
and
cried
and
throat
of
glue
how
to
know
the
one
that
due
and
the
serpent
replied
breast
of
snow
baleful
bliss
he
that
wooing
wins
a
kiss
she
clutched
one
at
her
elbow
a
hairy
serpent
with
yellow
languid
eyes
in
and
length
a
disease
to
look
on
and
cried
and
throat
of
gall
there
a
youth
beneath
the
pall
and
the
serpent
replied
brilliant
eye
bloody
tear
he
has
fed
us
for
a
year
she
squeezed
that
hairy
serpent
till
her
whitened
in
his
neck
and
he
dropped
lifelessly
crying
and
things
of
mud
sprang
my
beauty
from
his
blood
and
the
serpents
rose
erect
replying
yearly
one
of
us
must
die
yearly
for
us
dieth
one
else
the
queen
an
ugly
lie
lives
till
all
our
lives
be
done
bhanavar
stood
up
and
hurried
them
to
karatis
when
she
was
alone
she
fell
toward
the
floor
repeating
the
curse
suddenly
she
thought
another
year
my
beauty
shall
be
nourished
by
my
vengeance
yet
another
and
o
vizier
the
kiss
shall
be
thine
the
kiss
of
doom
for
i
have
doomed
thee
ere
now
thou
thou
shalt
restore
me
to
my
beauty
that
only
love
i
now
my
prince
is
lost
so
she
veiled
her
face
in
the
close
veil
of
the
virtuous
and
despatched
ukleet
whom
she
exalted
in
the
palace
of
the
king
to
the
vizier
and
ukleet
stood
before
aswarak
and
said
vizier
my
mistress
truly
is
longing
for
you
with
excessive
longing
and
in
what
she
now
undergoeth
is
forgotten
an
evil
done
by
you
to
her
and
she
bids
you
come
and
concert
with
her
a
scheme
deliberately
as
to
the
getting
rid
of
this
tyrant
who
is
an
affliction
to
her
and
her
life
is
lessened
by
him
the
vizier
was
deceived
by
his
passion
and
he
chuckled
and
exclaimed
very
dream
and
to
mind
me
of
her
then
she
sent
the
serpents
wullahy
in
the
matter
of
women
wait
for
as
the
poet
declareth
is
vanity
our
souls
for
such
to
vex
patience
is
a
harvest
of
the
sex
and
they
fret
themselves
not
overlong
for
husbands
that
are
gone
these
young
beauties
i
know
them
tell
the
queen
of
serpents
i
am
even
hers
to
the
sole
of
my
foot
so
it
was
understood
between
them
that
the
vizier
should
be
at
the
gate
of
the
garden
of
the
palace
that
night
disguised
and
the
vizier
rejoiced
thinking
she
have
not
the
jewel
with
her
it
shall
go
ill
with
me
and
i
foiled
this
time
ukleet
then
proceeded
to
the
house
of
boolp
the
broker
fronting
the
gutted
ruins
where
bhanavar
had
been
happy
in
her
innocence
with
almeryl
the
mountain
prince
her
husband
boolp
was
engaged
haggling
with
a
the
price
of
a
fair
slave
and
ukleet
said
to
him

a
fraction
of
treasure

boolp

in
such
a
case
and
ukleet
continued

boolp
hitched

nodded
at
him
and
repeated
the
distich
men
of
worth
and
men
of
wits
shoot
with
two
arrows
and
make
two
hits
so
he
arranged
with
boolp
the
same
appointment
as
with
the
vizier
and
returned
to
queen
bhanavar
now
in
the
dark
of
night
aswarak
stood
within
the
gate
of
the
garden
of
mashalleed
that
was
ajar
and
a
hand
from
a
veiled
figure
reached
to
him
and
he
caught
it
in
the
fulness
of
his
delusion
crying
my
queen
but
the
hand
signified
silence
and
drew
him
past
the
tank
of
the
garden
and
through
a
court
of
the
palace
into
a
passage
lit
with
lamps
and
on
into
a
chamber
and
beyond
a
heavy
curtain
into
another
a
circular
passage
descending
between
black
hangings
and
at
the
bottom
a
square
vault
draped
with
black
and
in
it
precious
woods
burning
oils
in
censers
and
the
odour
of
ambergris
and
myrrh
and
musk
floating
in
clouds
and
the
sight
of
the
vizier
was
for
a
time
obscured
by
the
thickness
of
the
incenses
floating
as
he
became
familiar
with
the
place
he
saw
marked
therein
a
board
spread
at
one
end
with
viands
and
wines
and
the
nosegay
in
a
and
cups
of
gold
and
a
service
of
gold
every
preparation
for
feasting
mightily
so
the
soul
of
aswarak
leapt
and
he
cried
unveil
thyself
o
moon
of
our
meeting
my
mistress
the
voice
of
bhanavar
answered
him
till
we
have
feasted
and
drunken
and
it
seemeth
little
in
our
eyes
surely
the
chamber
is
secure
could
i
have
chosen
one
better
for
our
meeting
o
aswarak
upon
that
he
entreated
her
to
sit
with
him
to
the
feast
but
she
cried
delay
till
the
other
is
come
cried
he
but
she
exclaimed
and
saying
thus
went
forward
to
the
foot
of
the
passage
and
boolp
was
there
following
ukleet
both
of
them
under
a
weight
of
bags
and
boxes
so
she
welcomed
the
broker
and
led
him
to
the
feast
he
coughing
and
wheezing
and
blinking
unwitting
the
vexation
of
the
vizier
nor
that
one
other
than
himself
was
there
when
boolp
heard
the
voice
of
the
vizier
in
astonishment
addressing
him
he
started
back
and
fell
upon
his
bags
and
the
task
of
coaxing
him
to
the
board
was
as
that
of
haling
a
distempered
beast
to
the
water
then
they
sat
and
feasted
together
and
ukleet
with
them
and
if
aswarak
or
boolp
waxed
impatient
of
each
other
presence
he
whispered
to
them
wait
see
what
she
reserveth
for
you
and
bhanavar
mused
with
herself
that
reserved
shall
be
not
long
coming
so
they
drank
and
wine
got
the
mastery
of
aswarak
so
that
he
made
no
secret
of
his
passion
and
began
to
lean
to
her
and
verse
extemporaneously
in
her
ear
and
she
stinted
not
in
her
replies
answering
to
his
urgency
in
girlish
guise
sighing
behind
the
veil
as
if
under
love
influence
and
the
vizier
pressed
close
and
sang
is
said
that
love
brings
beauty
to
the
cheeks
of
them
that
love
and
meet
but
mine
are
pale
for
merciless
disdain
on
me
she
wreaks
and
hides
her
visage
from
my
passionate
tale
i
have
her
only
only
when
she
speaks
bhanavar
unveil
i
have
thee
and
i
have
thee
not
like
one
lifted
by
spirits
to
a
shining
dale
in
paradise
who
seeks
to
leap
and
run
and
clasp
the
beauty
but
his
foot
doth
fail
for
he
is
blind
ah
then
more
woful
none
bhanavar
unveil
he
thrust
the
to
her
and
she
lifted
it
under
her
veil
and
then
sang
in
answer
to
him
my
beauty
for
thy
worth
thank
the
vizier
he
gives
thee
second
birth
thank
the
vizier
his
blooming
form
without
a
fault
thank
the
vizier
is
at
thy
foot
in
this
blest
vault
thank
the
vizier
he
knoweth
not
he
telleth
such
a
truth
thank
the
vizier
that
thou
thro
him
fresh
in
blushing
youth
thank
the
vizier
he
knoweth
little
now
but
he
shall
soon
be
wise
thank
the
vizier
this
meeting
bringeth
bloom
to
cheeks
and
lips
and
eyes
thank
the
vizier
o
my
beloved
in
this
blest
vault
if
i
love
thee
for
aye
thank
the
vizier
thine
am
i
thine
and
learns
his
soul
what
it
has
taught
to
die
thank
the
vizier
now
aswarak
divined
not
her
meaning
and
was
enraptured
with
her
and
cried
so
and
such
thy
love
thine
am
i
thine
and
what
a
music
is
thy
voice
o
my
mistress
a
bliss
to
eblis
in
his
torment
could
he
hear
it
life
of
my
head
and
is
thy
beauty
increased
by
me
nay
thou
flatterer
then
he
said
to
her
with
these
importunate
dogs
is
the
very
hour
of
tenderness
wullahy
they
offend
my
nostril
stung
am
i
at
the
sight
of
them
she
rejoined
o
aswarak
star
of
the
morn
thou
that
wakenest
my
beauty
from
night
and
scorn
thy
time
is
near
and
when
is
come
long
will
a
jackal
howl
that
this
thy
request
had
been
dumb
o
aswarak
star
of
the
morn
so
the
vizier
imaged
in
his
mind
the
neglect
of
mashalleed
from
these
words
and
said
the
king
to
my
care
o
queen
of
serpents
and
expend
no
portion
of
thy
power
on
him
but
hasten
now
the
going
of
these
fellows
my
heart
is
straitened
by
them
and
i
wullahy
would
gladly
see
a
serpent
round
the
necks
of
either
she
continued
o
aswarak
star
of
the
morn
lo
the
star
must
die
when
splendider
light
is
born
in
stronger
floods
the
beam
will
drown
shrink
thou
puny
orb
and
dread
to
bring
me
my
crown
o
aswarak
star
of
the
morn
then
said
she
awhile
at
those
two
there
a
disputation
between
them
so
they
hearkened
and
ukleet
was
pledging
boolp
and
passing
the
cup
to
him
but
a
sullenness
had
seized
the
broker
and
he
refused
it
and
ukleet
shouted
and
what
a
company
art
thou
that
thou
refusest
the
pledge
of
friendliness
plague
on
all
sulkers
and
the
broker
the
old
miser
obstinate
as
are
the
began
to
mumble
came
not
here
to
drink
o
ukleet
but
to
make
a
bargain
and
my
bags
be
here
and
i
like
not
yonder
veil
nor
the
presence
of
yonder
vizier
nor
the
secresy
of
this
now
by
the
prophet
and
that
interdict
of
his
i
drink
no
further
and
ukleet
said
her
not
mark
your
want
of
fellowship
or
go
ill
with
you
here
be
fine
wines
spirited
wines
choice
flavours
and
you
drink
not
where
the
soul
in
you
o
boolp
and
where
the
life
in
you
that
you
yield
her
to
the
vizier
utterly
surely
she
waiteth
a
gallant
sign
from
you
so
challenge
her
cheerily
quoth
boolp
care
not
shall
i
leave
my
wealth
and
all
i
possess
void
of
eyes
and
she
so
that
i
recognise
her
not
behind
the
veil
ukleet
pushed
the
old
miser
jeeringly
not
recognise
her
oh
boolp
a
pretty
dissimulation
pledge
her
now
a
cup
to
the
snatching
of
the
veil
and
bethink
you
of
a
fitting
verse
a
seemly
compliment
something
sugary
then
boolp
smoothed
his
head
and
was
bothered
and
tapped
it
and
commenced
repeating
to
bhanavar
i
saw
the
moon
behind
a
cloud
and
i
was
cold
as
one
that
in
his
shroud
and
i
cried
moon
ukleet
chorused
him
and
boolp
was
deranged
in
what
he
had
to
say
and
gasped
moon
i
cried
moon
and
i
cried
moon
then
the
vizier
and
ukleet
laughed
till
they
fell
on
their
backs
so
bhanavar
took
up
his
verse
where
he
left
it
singing
and
to
the
cry
moon
did
make
fair
the
following
reply
be
still
for
thy
desire
is
to
embrace
consuming
fire
then
said
boolp
my
mistress
the
laws
of
conviviality
have
till
now
restrained
me
but
my
coming
here
was
on
business
and
with
me
my
bags
in
good
faith
so
let
us
transact
this
matter
of
the
jewels
and
after
that
the
song
of
and
i
a
cup
will
try
even
as
thou
wilt
bhanavar
threw
aside
her
outer
robe
and
veil
and
appeared
in
a
dress
of
sumptuous
blue
spotted
with
gold
bees
her
face
veiled
with
a
veil
of
gauzy
silver
and
she
was
as
the
moon
in
summer
heavens
and
strode
mar
jestically
forward
saying
jewels
is
but
one
behold
the
lamps
were
extinguished
and
in
her
hand
was
the
glory
of
the
serpent
jewel
no
other
light
save
it
in
the
vaulted
chamber
so
the
old
miser
perked
his
chin
and
brows
and
cried
wondering
know
it
this
jewel
o
my
mistress
she
turned
to
the
vizier
and
said
lifting
the
red
gloom
of
the
jewel
on
him
thou
aswarak
ate
his
then
she
cried
much
ye
know
in
common
ye
two
thereupon
bhanavar
passed
from
the
feast
on
to
the
centre
of
the
vault
and
stood
before
the
tomb
of
almeryl
and
drew
the
cloth
from
it
and
they
saw
by
the
glow
of
the
jewel
that
it
was
a
tomb
when
she
had
mounted
some
steps
at
the
side
of
the
tomb
she
beckoned
them
to
come
crying
in
a
voice
of
sobs
which
is
here
likewise
ye
may
know
so
they
came
with
the
coldness
of
a
mystery
in
their
blood
and
looked
as
she
looked
intently
over
a
tomb
the
lid
was
of
glass
and
through
the
glass
of
the
lid
the
jewel
flung
a
dark
rosy
ray
on
the
body
of
almeryl
lying
beneath
it
now
the
miser
was
perplexed
at
the
sight
but
aswarak
stepped
backward
in
defiance
bellowing
for
this
i
was
tricked
to
come
here
is
fooling
me
a
second
time
by
allah
look
to
it
not
a
second
time
will
aswarak
be
fooled
then
she
ran
to
him
and
exclaimed
for
what
thou
to
me
and
he
foaming
and
grinding
his
breath
woman
of
wiles
thou
serpent
but
i
be
gone
from
here
so
she
faltered
in
sweetness
knowing
him
doomed
and
loving
to
dally
with
him
in
her
wickedness
if
thou
not
for
my
kiss
then
said
the
vizier
a
further
guile
not
an
outrage
to
bring
me
here
she
faltered
again
leaning
the
fair
length
of
her
limbs
on
a
couch
ill
that
we
are
not
alone
else
could
these
lips
convince
thee
well
else
indeed
and
the
vizier
cried
then
these
intruders
from
us
o
thou
sorceress
and
above
all
serpents
in
power
for
thou
poisonest
with
a
touch
and
the
eye
and
the
ear
alike
take
in
thy
poisons
greedily
thou
overcomest
the
senses
the
reason
the
judgment
yea
vindictiveness
wrath
suspicions
leading
the
soul
captive
with
a
breath
of
thine
as
a
breeze
from
the
gardens
of
bliss
bhanavar
changed
her
manner
a
little
lisping
why
that
starting
from
the
tomb
of
a
dead
harmless
youth
and
that
abuse
of
me
he
peered
at
her
inquiringly
echoing
and
she
repeated
as
a
child
might
repeat
it
that
then
the
vizier
smote
his
forehead
in
the
madness
of
utter
perplexity
changing
his
eye
from
bhanavar
to
the
tomb
of
almeryl
doubting
her
truth
yet
dreading
to
disbelieve
it
so
she
saw
him
fast
enmeshed
in
her
subtleties
and
clapped
her
hands
crying
again
with
me
to
the
tomb
and
note
if
there
be
aught
i
am
to
blame
in
o
aswarak
and
plight
thyself
to
me
beside
it
he
did
nothing
save
to
widen
his
eye
at
her
somewhat
and
she
said
two
are
yonside
the
tomb
and
they
hear
us
not
and
see
us
not
by
this
light
of
the
jewel
so
come
up
to
it
boldly
with
me
free
thy
mind
of
its
doubt
and
for
a
reconcilement
kiss
me
on
the
way
aswarak
moved
not
forward
but
as
bhanavar
laid
the
jewel
in
her
bosom
he
tore
the
veil
from
her
darkened
head
and
caught
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
then
bhanavar
laughed
and
shouted
is
it
with
thee
vizier
aswarak
he
was
tottering
and
muttered
a
hath
struck
me
even
to
my
marrow
so
she
drew
the
jewel
forth
once
more
and
rubbed
it
ablaze
and
the
noise
of
the
serpents
neared
and
they
streamed
into
the
vault
and
under
it
in
fiery
jets
surrounding
bhanavar
and
whizzing
about
her
till
in
their
velocity
they
were
indivisible
and
she
stood
as
a
fountain
of
fire
clothed
in
flashes
of
the
underworld
the
new
loveliness
of
her
face
growing
vivid
violet
like
an
incessant
lightning
above
them
then
stretched
she
her
two
hands
and
sang
to
the
serpents
hither
hither
to
the
feast
hither
to
the
sacrifice
virtue
for
my
sake
hath
ceased
now
to
make
an
end
of
vice
and
swelling
length
and
greedy
maw
i
have
had
a
horrid
wrong
retribution
is
the
law
ye
that
suck
my
youthful
lord
now
shall
make
another
meal
seize
the
black
vizier
abhorr
seize
him
seize
him
throat
and
heel
set
your
serpent
wits
to
find
tortures
of
a
new
device
have
him
have
him
heart
and
mind
hither
to
the
then
she
whirled
with
them
round
and
round
as
a
tempest
whirls
and
when
she
had
wound
them
to
a
fury
lo
she
burst
from
the
hissing
circle
and
dragged
ukleet
from
the
vault
into
the
passage
and
blocked
the
entrance
to
the
vault
so
was
queen
bhanavar
avenged
now
she
said
to
ukleet
presently
the
broker
him
they
will
not
harm
and
hastened
to
the
king
that
he
might
see
her
in
her
beauty
the
king
reclined
on
cushions
in
the
harem
with
a
fair
newly
from
the
mountains
toying
with
the
pearls
in
her
locks
then
thought
bhanavar
him
not
slight
me
so
she
drew
a
veil
over
her
face
and
sat
beside
mashalleed
the
king
continued
his
fondling
with
the
girl
saying
to
her
there
no
destiny
foretold
of
thy
coming
to
the
palace
of
the
king
to
rule
it
o
nashta
starbeam
in
the
waters
and
hadst
thou
no
dream
of
it
bhanavar
struck
the
king
arm
but
he
noticed
her
not
and
nashta
laughed
then
bhanavar
controlled
her
trembling
and
said
word
o
king
and
vouchsafe
me
a
hearing
the
king
replied
languidly
still
looking
on
nashta
a
command
that
the
voice
of
none
that
are
crabbed
and
hideous
be
heard
in
the
harem
and
i
find
comfort
in
it
o
nashta
but
speak
thou
my
fountain
of
dropping
bhanavar
caught
the
king
hand
and
said
have
to
speak
with
thee
the
queen
chase
from
us
this
little
wax
puppet
a
space
the
king
disengaged
his
hand
and
leaned
it
over
to
nashta
who
began
playing
with
it
and
fitting
on
it
a
ring
giggling
then
as
he
answered
nothing
bhanavar
came
nearer
and
slapped
him
on
the
cheek
mashalleed
started
to
his
feet
and
his
hand
grasped
his
girdle
but
that
wrathfulness
was
stayed
when
he
beheld
the
veil
slide
from
her
visage
so
he
cried
queen
my
soul
she
pointed
to
nashta
and
the
king
chid
the
girl
and
sent
her
forth
lean
with
his
shifted
displeasure
as
a
kitten
slinks
wet
from
a
pond
where
it
had
thought
to
catch
a
great
fish
then
bhanavar
exclaimed
was
a
change
in
thy
manner
to
me
before
that
creature
he
sought
to
dissimulate
with
her
but
at
last
he
confessed
was
truly
this
morning
the
victim
of
a
sorcery
thereupon
she
cried
thou
went
angered
to
find
me
not
by
thee
on
the
couch
but
one
in
my
place
a
hag
of
ugliness
hear
then
the
case
o
mashalleed
surely
that
old
crone
had
a
dream
and
it
was
that
if
she
slept
one
night
by
the
king
she
would
arise
fresh
in
health
from
her
ills
and
with
powers
lasting
a
year
to
heal
others
of
all
maladies
with
a
touch
so
she
came
to
me
petitioning
me
to
bring
this
about
o
my
lord
the
king
did
i
well
in
being
privy
to
her
desire
the
king
could
not
doubt
this
story
of
bhanavar
seeing
her
constant
loveliness
and
the
arch
of
her
flashing
brow
and
the
oval
of
her
cheek
and
chin
smooth
as
milk
so
he
said
my
queen
i
had
thought
to
go
as
i
must
gladly
but
how
shall
i
go
knowing
thy
truth
thy
beauty
unchanged
thee
faithful
a
follower
of
the
injunctions
of
the
prophet
in
charitable
deeds
cried
she
whither
goeth
my
lord
and
on
what
errand
he
answered
people
of
a
province
southward
have
raised
the
standard
of
revolt
and
mocked
my
authority
they
have
been
joined
by
certain
of
the
arab
chiefs
subject
to
my
dominion
and
have
defeated
my
armies
is
to
subdue
them
i
go
yea
to
crush
them
yet
wallaby
i
know
not
care
i
if
kingdoms
fall
away
and
nations
so
that
i
have
thee
nay
let
all
pass
so
that
thou
remain
by
me
bhanavar
paced
from
him
to
a
mirror
and
frowned
at
the
reflection
of
her
fairness
thinking
had
he
spoken
to
the
girl
nashta
or
another
this
king
and
she
thought
have
been
beloved
by
the
noblest
three
on
earth
i
will
ask
no
more
of
love
vengeance
i
have
had
is
time
that
i
demand
of
my
beauty
nothing
save
power
and
i
will
make
this
king
my
to
power
rejoicing
my
soul
with
the
shock
of
armies
now
she
persuaded
mashalleed
to
take
her
with
him
on
his
expedition
against
the
arabs
and
they
set
forth
heading
a
great
assemblage
of
warriors
southward
to
the
land
bordering
the
desert
the
king
credited
the
suggestions
of
bhanavar
that
aswarak
had
disappeared
to
join
the
rebels
and
pressed
forward
in
his
eagerness
to
inflict
a
chastisement
signal
in
swiftness
upon
them
and
that
traitor
so
eagerly
mashalleed
journeyed
to
his
army
in
advance
that
the
main
body
with
bhanavar
was
left
by
him
long
behind
she
had
encouraged
him
saying
shall
love
thee
much
if
thou
art
speedy
in
winning
success
the
queen
was
housed
on
an
elephant
harnessed
with
gold
and
with
silken
purple
trappings
from
the
curtains
of
her
palanquin
she
looked
on
a
mighty
march
of
warriors
filling
the
extent
of
the
plains
all
day
she
fed
her
sight
on
them
surely
the
story
of
her
beauty
became
noised
among
the
guards
of
her
person
that
rode
and
ran
beneath
the
royal
elephant
till
the
soldiers
of
mashalleed
spake
but
of
the
beauty
of
the
queen
and
bhanavar
was
as
a
moon
shining
over
that
sea
of
men
now
they
had
passed
the
cultivated
fields
and
were
halting
by
the
ford
of
a
river
bordering
the
desert
when
lo
a
warrior
on
the
yonside
riding
in
a
cloud
of
dust
and
his
shout
was
king
mashalleed
is
defeated
and
flying
then
the
captains
of
the
host
witnessed
to
the
greatness
of
allah
and
were
troubled
with
a
dread
fearing
to
advance
but
bhanavar
commanded
a
horse
to
be
saddled
for
her
and
mounted
it
and
plunged
through
the
ford
singly
so
they
followed
her
and
all
day
she
rode
forward
on
horseback
touching
neither
food
nor
drink
by
night
she
was
a
league
beyond
the
foremost
of
them
and
fell
upon
the
king
encamped
in
the
desert
with
the
loose
remnant
of
his
forces
mashalleed
when
he
had
looked
on
her
forgot
his
affliction
and
stood
up
to
embrace
her
but
bhanavar
spurned
him
crying
time
for
this
in
the
time
of
disgrace
then
she
said
came
it
he
answered
was
a
chief
among
the
enemy
an
arab
before
the
terror
of
whom
my
people
fled
cried
she
him
on
the
morrow
and
till
then
i
eat
not
drink
not
sleep
not
on
the
morrow
mashalleed
again
encountered
the
rebels
and
bhanavar
seated
on
her
elephant
from
a
under
a
palm
beheld
the
prowess
of
the
arab
chief
and
the
tempest
of
battle
that
he
was
she
thought
have
seen
but
one
mighty
in
combat
like
that
one
ruark
the
chief
of
the
thereupon
she
coursed
toward
the
king
even
where
the
arrows
gloomed
like
locusts
thick
and
dark
in
the
air
aloof
and
said
victory
is
with
yonder
chief
hurl
on
him
three
of
thy
sons
of
valour
the
three
were
selected
and
made
onslaught
on
this
chief
and
perished
under
his
arm
bhanavar
saw
them
fall
and
exclaimed
attack
on
him
and
with
thrice
three
her
will
was
the
mandate
of
mashalleed
and
these
likewise
were
ordered
forth
and
closed
on
the
chief
but
he
darted
from
their
toils
and
wheeled
about
them
spearing
them
one
by
one
till
the
nine
were
in
the
dust
bhanavar
compressed
her
dry
lips
and
muttered
to
the
king
thou
a
body
against
him
mashalleed
gathered
round
his
standard
the
chosen
of
his
warriors
and
smoothed
his
beard
and
headed
them
then
the
chief
struck
his
lance
behind
him
and
stretched
rapidly
a
across
the
sand
and
halted
on
a
knoll
when
they
neared
him
he
retreated
in
a
further
circle
and
continued
this
wise
wasting
the
fury
of
mashalleed
till
he
stood
among
his
followers
there
as
the
king
hesitated
and
prepared
to
retreat
he
and
the
others
of
the
tribe
levelled
their
lances
and
hung
upon
his
rear
fretting
them
slaughtering
captains
of
the
troop
when
mashalleed
turned
to
face
his
pursuer
the
chief
was
alone
immovable
on
his
mare
fronting
the
ranks
then
bhanavar
taunted
the
king
and
he
essayed
the
capture
of
that
chief
a
second
time
and
a
third
and
it
was
each
time
as
the
first
bhanavar
looked
about
her
with
rapid
eyes
murmuring
what
a
chief
is
he
oh
that
a
cloud
would
fall
a
smoke
arise
to
blind
these
hosts
that
i
might
sling
my
serpents
on
him
unseen
for
i
will
not
be
vanquished
though
it
be
by
ruark
so
she
drew
to
the
king
and
the
altercation
between
them
was
fierce
in
the
fury
of
the
battle
he
saying
a
feint
of
the
chief
this
challenge
and
i
must
succour
the
left
of
my
army
by
the
well
that
he
is
overmatching
with
numbers
and
she
thou
head
them
not
then
will
i
and
thou
shalt
behold
a
woman
do
what
thou
durst
not
and
lose
her
love
and
win
her
scorn
while
they
spake
the
arabs
they
looked
on
seemed
to
flutter
and
waver
and
the
chief
was
backing
to
them
calling
to
them
as
words
of
shame
to
rally
them
seeing
this
mashalleed
charged
against
the
chief
once
more
and
lo
the
arabs
opened
to
receive
him
closing
on
his
band
of
warriors
like
waters
whitened
by
the
storm
on
a
fleet
of
vessels
and
there
was
a
dust
and
a
tumult
visible
such
as
is
seen
in
the
darkness
when
a
vessel
struck
by
the
is
sinking
flashes
of
steel
lifting
of
hands
rolling
of
horsemen
and
horses
then
bhanavar
groaned
aloud
are
lost
shame
to
us
only
one
hope
is
is
ruark
this
chief
now
the
view
of
the
plain
cleared
and
with
it
she
beheld
the
army
of
mashalleed
broken
the
king
borne
down
by
a
dust
of
arabs
so
she
unveiled
her
face
and
rode
on
the
host
with
the
horsemen
that
guarded
her
glorious
with
a
crown
of
gold
and
the
glowing
jewel
on
her
brow
when
she
was
a
javelin
flight
from
them
the
arabs
shouted
and
paused
in
terror
for
the
light
of
her
head
was
as
the
sun
setting
between
clouds
of
thunder
but
that
chief
dashed
forward
like
a
flame
beaten
level
by
the
wind
crying
bhanavar
and
she
knew
the
features
of
ruark
so
she
said
i
and
he
cried
again
bhanavar
and
was
as
one
stricken
by
a
shaft
then
bhanavar
threw
on
him
certain
of
the
horsemen
with
her
and
he
suffered
them
without
a
sign
to
surround
him
and
grasp
his
mare
by
the
and
bring
him
disarmed
before
the
queen
at
sight
of
ruark
a
captive
the
arabs
fell
into
confusion
and
lost
heart
and
were
speedily
chased
and
scattered
from
the
scene
like
a
loose
spray
before
the
wind
but
mashalleed
the
king
rejoiced
mightily
and
praised
bhanavar
and
the
whole
army
of
the
king
praised
her
magnifying
her
now
with
ruark
she
interchanged
no
syllable
and
said
not
farewell
to
him
when
she
departed
with
mashalleed
to
encounter
other
tribes
and
the
chief
was
bound
and
conducted
a
prisoner
to
the
city
of
the
inland
sea
and
cast
into
prison
in
expectation
of
death
the
releaser
and
continued
there
wellnigh
a
year
eating
the
bitter
bread
of
captivity
in
the
evening
of
every
seventh
day
there
came
to
him
a
little
mountain
girl
that
sat
by
him
and
leaned
a
lute
to
her
bosom
singing
of
the
mountain
and
the
desert
but
he
turned
his
face
from
her
to
the
wall
one
day
she
sang
of
death
the
releaser
and
ruark
thought
come
she
warneth
me
merciful
is
allah
on
the
morning
that
followed
ukleet
entered
the
cell
and
with
him
three
slaves
blacks
armed
with
scimitars
so
ruark
stood
up
and
bore
witness
to
his
faith
saying
with
the
stroke
but
ukleet
exclaimed
not
the
end
is
not
yet
then
said
he
with
thee
these
slaves
o
chief
excelling
in
martial
qualities
surely
they
my
retinue
and
the
retinue
of
them
of
my
rank
in
the
palace
and
where
i
go
they
go
for
the
exalted
have
more
shadows
than
one
yea
three
have
they
in
my
case
even
very
grimly
black
shadows
whereon
the
idle
expend
not
laughter
and
whoso
joketh
in
their
hearing
is
wullahy
the
last
joke
of
that
person
in
are
the
powerful
known
among
men
they
that
stand
very
prominent
in
the
beams
of
prosperity
now
this
of
myself
but
for
thee
of
a
surety
the
queen
bhanavar
my
mistress
will
be
here
by
the
time
of
the
rising
of
the
moon
in
the
name
of
allah
saying
that
he
departed
in
his
greatness
and
ruark
watched
for
her
that
rose
in
his
soul
as
the
moon
in
the
heavens
meanwhile
bhanavar
had
mused
this
day
the
day
when
the
serpents
desire
their
due
and
the
king
mashalleed
they
shall
have
for
what
is
life
to
him
but
a
treachery
and
a
dalliance
and
what
is
my
hold
on
him
but
this
jewel
of
the
serpents
he
has
had
the
profit
of
beauty
and
he
shall
yield
the
penalty
my
kiss
is
for
him
my
and
i
will
release
ruark
and
espouse
him
and
war
with
kings
sultans
emperors
infidels
subduing
them
till
they
worship
me
she
flashed
her
figure
in
the
glass
and
was
lovely
therein
as
one
in
the
light
of
paradise
but
ere
she
reached
the
king
mashalleed
lo
the
hour
of
the
serpents
had
struck
and
her
beauty
melted
from
her
as
snow
melts
from
off
the
rock
and
she
was
suddenly
haggard
in
utter
uncomeliness
and
knew
it
not
but
marched
smiling
a
grand
smile
on
to
the
king
now
as
mashalleed
lifted
his
eyes
to
her
he
started
amazed
crying
hag
again
and
she
said
of
the
hag
o
my
lord
the
king
thereat
he
was
yet
more
amazed
and
exclaimed
hag
of
ugliness
with
the
voice
of
bhanavar
has
then
the
queen
lent
that
loathsomeness
her
voice
also
bhanavar
chilled
a
moment
and
looked
on
the
faces
of
the
women
present
and
they
were
staring
at
her
the
younger
ones
tittering
and
among
them
nashta
whom
she
hated
so
she
cried
with
ye
but
the
king
commanded
them
then
the
queen
leaned
to
him
saying
will
speak
with
my
lord
alone
whereat
he
shrank
from
her
and
spat
ice
and
flame
shivered
through
the
blood
of
bhanavar
yet
such
was
her
eagerness
to
give
the
kiss
to
mashalleed
that
she
leaned
to
him
still
wooing
him
to
her
with
smiles
then
the
king
seized
her
violently
and
flung
her
over
the
marble
floor
to
the
very
basin
of
the
fountain
and
the
crown
that
was
on
her
brow
fell
and
rolled
to
the
feet
of
nashta
the
girl
lifted
it
laughing
and
was
in
the
act
of
fitting
it
to
her
fair
head
amid
the
chuckles
of
her
companions
when
a
slap
from
the
hand
of
bhanavar
spun
her
twice
round
and
she
dropped
to
the
marble
insensible
the
king
bellowed
in
wrath
and
ran
to
nashta
crying
to
the
queen
that
crown
to
her
foul
hag
but
bhanavar
had
bent
over
the
basin
of
the
fountain
and
beheld
the
image
of
her
change
therein
and
was
hurrying
from
the
hall
and
down
the
corridors
of
the
palace
to
the
private
chamber
so
he
made
bare
the
steel
by
his
side
and
followed
her
with
a
number
of
the
harem
guard
menacing
her
and
commanding
her
to
surrender
the
crown
with
the
jewel
ere
she
could
lay
hand
on
a
veil
he
was
beside
her
and
she
was
encompassed
in
that
extremity
bhanavar
plucked
the
jewel
from
her
crown
and
rubbed
it
calling
the
serpents
to
her
one
came
one
only
and
that
one
would
not
move
from
her
to
sling
himself
about
the
neck
of
mashalleed
but
whirled
round
her
hissing
every
hour
a
serpent
dies
till
we
have
the
sacrifice
sweeten
sweeten
with
thy
kiss
quick
a
soul
for
karatis
surely
the
king
bit
his
breath
marvelling
and
his
fury
became
an
awful
fear
and
he
fell
back
from
her
molesting
her
no
further
then
she
squeezed
the
serpent
till
his
body
writhed
in
knots
and
veiled
herself
and
sprang
down
a
secret
passage
to
the
garden
and
it
was
the
time
of
the
rising
of
the
moon
coolness
and
soothingness
dropped
on
her
as
a
balm
from
the
great
light
and
she
gazed
on
it
murmuring
as
in
a
memory
shall
i
counsel
the
moon
in
her
ascending
stay
under
that
dark
through
the
night
rest
on
the
mountain
slope
by
the
couching
antelope
o
thou
enthroned
supremacy
of
light
and
for
ever
the
lustre
thou
art
lending
lean
on
the
fair
long
brook
that
leaps
and
leaps
silvery
leaps
and
falls
hang
by
the
moon
and
arise
no
more
to
crown
the
steeps
for
a
danger
and
dolour
is
thy
wending
and
she
panted
and
sighed
and
wept
crying
who
will
kiss
me
or
have
my
kiss
now
that
i
may
indeed
be
as
yonder
beam
who
that
i
may
be
avenged
on
this
king
and
who
sang
that
song
of
the
ascending
of
the
moon
that
comes
to
me
as
a
part
of
me
from
old
times
as
she
gazed
on
the
circled
radiance
swimming
under
a
plume
of
palm
leaves
she
exclaimed
ruark
the
chief
so
she
clasped
her
hands
to
her
bosom
and
crouched
under
the
shadows
of
the
garden
and
fled
through
the
garden
gates
and
the
streets
of
the
city
heavily
veiled
to
the
prison
where
ruark
awaited
her
within
the
walls
and
ukleet
without
the
governor
of
the
prison
had
been
warned
by
ukleet
of
her
coming
and
the
doors
and
bars
opened
before
her
unchallenged
till
she
stood
in
the
cell
of
ruark
her
eyes
that
were
alone
unveiled
scanned
the
countenance
of
the
chief
the
fevered
of
his
looks
and
by
the
little
moonlight
in
the
cell
she
saw
with
a
glance
the
and
the
fetters
and
the
and
water
untasted
on
the
bench
signs
of
his
misery
and
desire
for
her
coming
so
she
greeted
him
with
the
word
of
peace
and
he
replied
with
the
name
of
the
then
said
she
ruark
of
rukrooth
thy
mother
tell
me
somewhat
he
answered
know
nought
of
her
since
that
day
allah
have
her
in
his
keeping
so
she
cried
what
thou
ruark
is
a
riddle
then
he
oath
of
ruark
is
no
rope
of
sand
he
swore
to
see
her
not
till
he
had
set
eyes
on
bhanavar
she
knelt
by
the
chief
saying
in
a
soft
voice
greatly
the
chief
of
the
loved
bhanavar
and
she
thought
greatly
and
verily
love
i
him
and
he
shall
be
no
victim
of
the
serpents
for
i
defy
them
and
give
them
other
prey
so
she
said
in
deeper
notes
the
queen
is
come
hither
to
release
thee
o
my
chief
o
thou
soul
of
wrath
ruark
my
my
eagle
of
the
desert
where
is
one
on
earth
beloved
as
thou
art
by
bhanavar
the
dark
light
in
his
eyes
kindled
as
light
in
the
eyes
of
a
lion
and
she
continued
what
a
yoke
is
hers
who
weareth
this
crown
he
that
is
my
lord
how
am
i
mated
to
him
save
in
loathing
o
my
chief
my
lion
hadst
thou
no
dream
of
bhanavar
that
she
would
come
hither
to
unbind
thee
and
lift
thee
beside
her
and
live
with
thee
in
love
and
veilless
loveliness
thine
yea
and
in
power
over
lands
and
nations
and
armies
lording
the
infidel
taming
them
to
submission
exulting
in
defiance
and
assaults
and
victories
and
magnanimities
thou
and
she
then
while
his
breast
heaved
like
a
broad
wave
the
queen
started
to
her
feet
crying
she
is
here
and
this
she
offereth
thee
ruark
a
shrill
cry
parted
from
her
lips
and
to
the
clapping
of
her
hands
slaves
entered
the
cell
with
lamps
and
instruments
to
strike
off
the
fetters
from
the
chief
and
they
released
him
and
ruark
leaned
on
their
shoulders
to
bear
the
weight
of
a
limb
so
was
he
weakened
by
captivity
but
bhanavar
thrust
them
from
the
chief
and
took
the
pressure
of
his
elbow
on
her
own
shoulder
and
walked
with
him
thus
to
the
door
of
the
cell
he
sighing
as
one
in
a
dream
that
dreameth
the
bliss
of
bliss
now
they
had
gone
three
paces
onward
and
were
in
the
light
of
many
lamps
when
behold
the
veil
of
bhanavar
caught
in
the
sleeve
of
ruark
as
he
lifted
it
and
her
visage
became
bare
she
shrieked
and
caught
up
her
two
hands
to
her
brow
but
the
slaves
had
a
glimpse
of
her
and
said
among
themselves
is
not
the
queen
and
they
murmured
an
impostor
one
in
league
with
the
chief
bhanavar
heard
them
say
her
with
him
at
the
governor
gate
and
summoned
her
soul
thinking
loveth
me
the
chief
he
will
look
into
my
eyes
and
mark
not
the
change
what
need
i
then
to
dread
his
scorn
when
i
ask
of
him
the
kiss
now
must
it
be
given
or
we
are
lost
both
of
us
and
she
raised
her
head
on
ruark
and
said
to
him
my
chief
ere
we
leave
these
walls
and
join
our
fates
wilt
thou
plight
thyself
to
me
with
a
kiss
ruark
leapt
to
her
like
the
bounding
leopard
and
gave
her
the
kiss
as
were
it
his
whole
soul
he
gave
then
in
a
moment
bhanavar
felt
the
blush
of
beauty
burn
over
her
and
drew
the
veil
down
on
her
face
and
suffered
the
slaves
to
arrest
her
with
ruark
and
bring
her
before
the
governor
and
from
the
governor
to
the
king
in
his
with
the
chief
of
the
now
the
king
mashalleed
called
to
her
traitress
thou
sorceress
thou
serpent
and
she
answered
under
the
veil
o
my
lord
the
king
and
wherefore
these
evil
names
of
me
cried
he
thing
of
guile
and
thou
hast
pleaded
with
me
for
the
life
of
the
chief
thus
long
to
visit
him
in
secret
life
of
my
head
i
but
mashalleed
is
not
one
to
be
fooled
so
she
said
bhanavar
hast
thou
forgotten
her
then
he
waxed
white
with
rage
exclaiming
is
she
a
serpent
in
the
slough
and
ukleet
in
the
torture
hath
told
of
thee
what
is
known
to
him
unveil
unveil
she
threw
the
veil
from
her
figure
and
smiled
for
mashalleed
was
mute
the
torrent
of
invective
frozen
on
his
mouth
when
he
beheld
the
miracle
of
beauty
that
she
was
the
splendid
jewel
of
throbbing
loveliness
so
to
scourge
him
with
the
bitter
lash
of
jealousy
bhanavar
turned
her
eyes
on
ruark
and
said
sweetly
shalt
thou
live
to
taste
again
the
bliss
of
the
desert
pleasant
was
our
time
in
it
o
my
chief
the
king
glared
and
choked
and
she
said
again
he
conquered
thee
but
i
and
i
that
conquered
thee
little
will
it
be
for
me
to
conquer
him
his
threats
are
the
winds
of
idleness
surely
the
world
darkened
before
the
eyes
of
mashalleed
and
he
arose
and
called
to
his
guard
hoarsely
off
their
heads
they
hesitated
dreading
the
queen
and
he
roared
them
bhanavar
beheld
the
winking
of
the
steel
but
ere
the
scimitars
descended
she
seized
ruark
and
they
stood
in
a
whizzing
ring
of
serpents
the
sound
of
whom
was
as
the
hum
of
a
thousand
wires
struck
by
then
she
glowed
towering
over
them
with
the
chief
clasped
to
her
and
crying
king
of
vileness
match
thy
slaves
with
my
creatures
of
the
caves
and
she
sang
to
the
serpents
seize
upon
him
sting
him
thro
thrice
this
day
shall
pay
your
due
but
they
instead
of
obeying
her
injunction
made
narrower
their
circle
round
bhanavar
and
the
chief
she
yellowed
and
took
hold
of
the
nearest
serpent
horribly
crying
dare
against
me
to
rebel
ye
the
bitter
brood
of
hell
and
the
serpent
gasped
in
reply
one
the
kiss
to
us
secures
give
us
ours
and
we
are
yours
thereupon
another
of
the
serpents
swung
on
the
feet
of
ruark
winding
his
length
upward
round
the
body
of
the
chief
so
she
tugged
at
that
one
tearing
it
from
him
violently
and
crying
him
ye
shall
not
have
i
swear
seize
the
king
that
crouching
there
and
that
serpent
hissed
this
is
he
the
kiss
ensures
give
us
ours
and
we
are
yours
another
and
another
serpent
she
flung
from
the
chief
and
they
began
to
swarm
venomously
answering
her
no
more
then
ruark
bore
witness
to
his
faith
and
folded
his
arms
with
the
grave
smile
she
had
known
in
the
desert
and
bhanavar
struggled
and
tussled
with
the
serpents
in
fierceness
strangling
and
tossing
them
to
right
and
left
is
allah
cried
all
present
and
the
king
trembled
for
never
was
sight
like
that
seen
the
hall
flashing
with
the
serpents
and
a
their
queen
raging
to
save
one
from
their
fury
shrieking
at
intervals
never
never
shall
ye
fold
save
with
me
the
man
i
hold
but
now
the
hiss
and
scream
of
the
serpents
and
the
noise
of
their
circling
was
quickened
to
a
slurred
savage
sound
and
they
closed
on
ruark
and
she
felt
him
stifling
and
that
they
were
relentless
so
in
the
height
of
the
tempest
bhanavar
seized
the
jewel
in
the
gold
circlet
on
her
brow
and
cast
it
from
her
lo
the
serpents
instantly
abated
their
frenzy
and
flew
all
of
them
to
pluck
the
jewel
chasing
the
one
that
had
it
in
his
fangs
through
the
casement
and
the
hall
breathed
empty
of
them
then
in
the
silence
that
was
bhanavar
veiled
her
face
and
said
to
the
chief
from
the
hall
while
they
yet
dread
me
no
longer
am
i
queen
of
serpents
but
he
replied
said
i
not
my
soul
is
thine
she
cried
to
him
thou
not
the
change
in
me
i
was
bound
to
those
serpents
for
my
beauty
and
is
gone
now
am
i
powerless
hateful
to
look
on
o
ruark
my
chief
he
remained
still
saying
thou
hast
been
thou
art
she
exclaimed
true
soul
the
light
is
hateful
to
me
as
i
to
the
light
but
i
will
yet
save
thee
to
comfort
rukrooth
thy
mother
so
she
drew
him
with
her
swiftly
from
the
hall
of
the
king
ere
the
king
had
recovered
his
voice
of
command
but
now
the
wrath
of
the
was
upon
her
and
him
surely
within
an
hour
from
the
flight
of
the
serpents
the
slaves
and
soldiers
of
mashalleed
laid
at
his
feet
two
heads
that
were
the
heads
of
ruark
and
bhanavar
and
they
said
great
king
we
tracked
them
to
her
chamber
and
through
to
a
passage
and
a
vault
hung
with
black
wherein
were
two
corpses
one
in
a
tomb
and
one
unburied
and
we
slew
them
there
clasping
each
other
o
king
of
the
age
mashalleed
gazed
upon
the
head
of
bhanavar
and
sighed
for
death
had
made
the
head
again
fair
with
a
wondrous
beauty
a
loveliness
never
before
seen
on
earth
