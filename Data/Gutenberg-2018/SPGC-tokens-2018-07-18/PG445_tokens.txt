the

a

the
following
work
is
devoted
to
an
account
of
the
characteristics
of
crowds
the
whole
of
the
common
characteristics
with
which
heredity
endows
the
individuals
of
a
race
constitute
the
genius
of
the
race
when
however
a
certain
number
of
these
individuals
are
gathered
together
in
a
crowd
for
purposes
of
action
observation
proves
that
from
the
mere
fact
of
their
being
assembled
there
result
certain
new
psychological
characteristics
which
are
added
to
the
racial
characteristics
and
differ
from
them
at
times
to
a
very
considerable
degree
organised
crowds
have
always
played
an
important
part
in
the
life
of
peoples
but
this
part
has
never
been
of
such
moment
as
at
present
the
substitution
of
the
unconscious
action
of
crowds
for
the
conscious
activity
of
individuals
is
one
of
the
principal
characteristics
of
the
present
age
i
have
endeavoured
to
examine
the
difficult
problem
presented
by
crowds
in
a
purely
scientific
manner
that
is
by
making
an
effort
to
proceed
with
method
and
without
being
influenced
by
opinions
theories
and
doctrines
this
i
believe
is
the
only
mode
of
arriving
at
the
discovery
of
some
few
particles
of
truth
especially
when
dealing
as
is
the
case
here
with
a
question
that
is
the
subject
of
impassioned
controversy
a
man
of
science
bent
on
verifying
a
phenomenon
is
not
called
upon
to
concern
himself
with
the
interests
his
verifications
may
hurt
in
a
recent
publication
an
eminent
thinker
goblet
made
the
remark
that
belonging
to
none
of
the
contemporary
schools
i
am
occasionally
found
in
opposition
of
sundry
of
the
conclusions
of
all
of
them
i
hope
this
new
work
will
merit
a
similar
observation
to
belong
to
a
school
is
necessarily
to
espouse
its
prejudices
and
preconceived
opinions
still
i
should
explain
to
the
reader
why
he
will
find
me
draw
conclusions
from
my
investigations
which
it
might
be
thought
at
first
sight
they
do
not
bear
why
for
instance
after
noting
the
extreme
mental
inferiority
of
crowds
picked
assemblies
included
i
yet
affirm
it
would
be
dangerous
to
meddle
with
their
organisation
notwithstanding
this
inferiority
the
reason
is
that
the
most
attentive
observation
of
the
facts
of
history
has
invariably
demonstrated
to
me
that
social
organisms
being
every
whit
as
complicated
as
those
of
all
beings
it
is
in
no
wise
in
our
power
to
force
them
to
undergo
on
a
sudden
transformations
nature
has
recourse
at
times
to
radical
measures
but
never
after
our
fashion
which
explains
how
it
is
that
nothing
is
more
fatal
to
a
people
than
the
mania
for
great
reforms
however
excellent
these
reforms
may
appear
theoretically
they
would
only
be
useful
were
it
possible
to
change
instantaneously
the
genius
of
nations
this
power
however
is
only
possessed
by
time
men
are
ruled
by
ideas
sentiments
and
customs
matters
which
are
of
the
essence
of
ourselves
institutions
and
laws
are
the
outward
manifestation
of
our
character
the
expression
of
its
needs
being
its
outcome
institutions
and
laws
can
not
change
this
character
the
study
of
social
phenomena
can
not
be
separated
from
that
of
the
peoples
among
whom
they
have
come
into
existence
from
the
philosophic
point
of
view
these
phenomena
may
have
an
absolute
value
in
practice
they
have
only
a
relative
value
it
is
necessary
in
consequence
when
studying
a
social
phenomenon
to
consider
it
successively
under
two
very
different
aspects
it
will
then
be
seen
that
the
teachings
of
pure
reason
are
very
often
contrary
to
those
of
practical
reason
there
are
scarcely
any
data
even
physical
to
which
this
distinction
is
not
applicable
from
the
point
of
view
of
absolute
truth
a
cube
or
a
circle
are
invariable
geometrical
figures
rigorously
defined
by
certain
formulas
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
impression
they
make
on
our
eye
these
geometrical
figures
may
assume
very
varied
shapes
by
perspective
the
cube
may
be
transformed
into
a
pyramid
or
a
square
the
circle
into
an
ellipse
or
a
straight
line
moreover
the
consideration
of
these
fictitious
shapes
is
far
more
important
than
that
of
the
real
shapes
for
it
is
they
and
they
alone
that
we
see
and
that
can
be
reproduced
by
photography
or
in
pictures
in
certain
cases
there
is
more
truth
in
the
unreal
than
in
the
real
to
present
objects
with
their
exact
geometrical
forms
would
be
to
distort
nature
and
render
it
unrecognisable
if
we
imagine
a
world
whose
inhabitants
could
only
copy
or
photograph
objects
but
were
unable
to
touch
them
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
such
persons
to
attain
to
an
exact
idea
of
their
form
moreover
the
knowledge
of
this
form
accessible
only
to
a
small
number
of
learned
men
would
present
but
a
very
minor
interest
the
philosopher
who
studies
social
phenomena
should
bear
in
mind
that
side
by
side
with
their
theoretical
value
they
possess
a
practical
value
and
that
this
latter
so
far
as
the
evolution
of
civilisation
is
concerned
is
alone
of
importance
the
recognition
of
this
fact
should
render
him
very
circumspect
with
regard
to
the
conclusions
that
logic
would
seem
at
first
to
enforce
upon
him
there
are
other
motives
that
dictate
to
him
a
like
reserve
the
complexity
of
social
facts
is
such
that
it
is
impossible
to
grasp
them
as
a
whole
and
to
foresee
the
effects
of
their
reciprocal
influence
it
seems
too
that
behind
the
visible
facts
are
hidden
at
times
thousands
of
invisible
causes
visible
social
phenomena
appear
to
be
the
result
of
an
immense
unconscious
working
that
as
a
rule
is
beyond
the
reach
of
our
analysis
perceptible
phenomena
may
be
compared
to
the
waves
which
are
the
expression
on
the
surface
of
the
ocean
of
disturbances
of
which
we
know
nothing
so
far
as
the
majority
of
their
acts
are
considered
crowds
display
a
singularly
inferior
mentality
yet
there
are
other
acts
in
which
they
appear
to
be
guided
by
those
mysterious
forces
which
the
ancients
denominated
destiny
nature
or
providence
which
we
call
the
voices
of
the
dead
and
whose
power
it
is
impossible
to
overlook
although
we
ignore
their
essence
it
would
seem
at
times
as
if
there
were
latent
forces
in
the
inner
being
of
nations
which
serve
to
guide
them
what
for
instance
can
be
more
complicated
more
logical
more
marvellous
than
a
language
yet
whence
can
this
admirably
organised
production
have
arisen
except
it
be
the
outcome
of
the
unconscious
genius
of
crowds
the
most
learned
academics
the
most
esteemed
grammarians
can
do
no
more
than
note
down
the
laws
that
govern
languages
they
would
be
utterly
incapable
of
creating
them
even
with
respect
to
the
ideas
of
great
men
are
we
certain
that
they
are
exclusively
the
offspring
of
their
brains
no
doubt
such
ideas
are
always
created
by
solitary
minds
but
is
it
not
the
genius
of
crowds
that
has
furnished
the
thousands
of
grains
of
dust
forming
the
soil
in
which
they
have
sprung
up
crowds
doubtless
are
always
unconscious
but
this
very
unconsciousness
is
perhaps
one
of
the
secrets
of
their
strength
in
the
natural
world
beings
exclusively
governed
by
instinct
accomplish
acts
whose
marvellous
complexity
astounds
us
reason
is
an
attribute
of
humanity
of
too
recent
date
and
still
too
imperfect
to
reveal
to
us
the
laws
of
the
unconscious
and
still
more
to
take
its
place
the
part
played
by
the
unconscious
in
all
our
acts
is
immense
and
that
played
by
reason
very
small
the
unconscious
acts
like
a
force
still
unknown
if
we
wish
then
to
remain
within
the
narrow
but
safe
limits
within
which
science
can
attain
to
knowledge
and
not
to
wander
in
the
domain
of
vague
conjecture
and
vain
hypothesis
all
we
must
do
is
simply
to
take
note
of
such
phenomena
as
are
accessible
to
us
and
confine
ourselves
to
their
consideration
every
conclusion
drawn
from
our
observation
is
as
a
rule
premature
for
behind
the
phenomena
which
we
see
clearly
are
other
phenomena
that
we
see
indistinctly
and
perhaps
behind
these
latter
yet
others

we

not

introduction
the
era
of
crowds
the
evolution
of
the
present
age
the
great
changes
in
civilisation
are
the
consequence
of
changes
in
national
thought
modern
belief
in
the
power
of
crowds
it
transforms
the
traditional
policy
of
the
european
states
how
the
rise
of
the
popular
classes
comes
about
and
the
manner
in
which
they
exercise
their
power
the
necessary
consequences
of
the
power
of
the
crowd
crowds
unable
to
play
a
part
other
than
destructive
the
dissolution
of
civilisations
is
the
work
of
the
crowd
general
ignorance
of
the
psychology
of
crowds
importance
of
the
study
of
crowds
for
legislators
and
statesmen
the
great
upheavals
which
precede
changes
of
civilisations
such
as
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
and
the
foundation
of
the
arabian
empire
seem
at
first
sight
determined
more
especially
by
political
transformations
foreign
invasion
or
the
overthrow
of
dynasties
but
a
more
attentive
study
of
these
events
shows
that
behind
their
apparent
causes
the
real
cause
is
generally
seen
to
be
a
profound
modification
in
the
ideas
of
the
peoples
the
true
historical
upheavals
are
not
those
which
astonish
us
by
their
grandeur
and
violence
the
only
important
changes
whence
the
renewal
of
civilisations
results
affect
ideas
conceptions
and
beliefs
the
memorable
events
of
history
are
the
visible
effects
of
the
invisible
changes
of
human
thought
the
reason
these
great
events
are
so
rare
is
that
there
is
nothing
so
stable
in
a
race
as
the
inherited
groundwork
of
its
thoughts
the
present
epoch
is
one
of
these
critical
moments
in
which
the
thought
of
mankind
is
undergoing
a
process
of
transformation
two
fundamental
factors
are
at
the
base
of
this
transformation
the
first
is
the
destruction
of
those
religious
political
and
social
beliefs
in
which
all
the
elements
of
our
civilisation
are
rooted
the
second
is
the
creation
of
entirely
new
conditions
of
existence
and
thought
as
the
result
of
modern
scientific
and
industrial
discoveries
the
ideas
of
the
past
although
half
destroyed
being
still
very
powerful
and
the
ideas
which
are
to
replace
them
being
still
in
process
of
formation
the
modern
age
represents
a
period
of
transition
and
anarchy
it
is
not
easy
to
say
as
yet
what
will
one
day
be
evolved
from
this
necessarily
somewhat
chaotic
period
what
will
be
the
fundamental
ideas
on
which
the
societies
that
are
to
succeed
our
own
will
be
built
up
we
do
not
at
present
know
still
it
is
already
clear
that
on
whatever
lines
the
societies
of
the
future
are
organised
they
will
have
to
count
with
a
new
power
with
the
last
surviving
sovereign
force
of
modern
times
the
power
of
crowds
on
the
ruins
of
so
many
ideas
formerly
considered
beyond
discussion
and
decayed
or
decaying
of
so
many
sources
of
authority
that
successive
revolutions
have
destroyed
this
power
which
alone
has
arisen
in
their
stead
seems
soon
destined
to
absorb
the
others
while
all
our
ancient
beliefs
are
tottering
and
disappearing
while
the
old
pillars
of
society
are
giving
way
one
by
one
the
power
of
the
crowd
is
the
only
force
that
nothing
menaces
and
of
which
the
prestige
is
continually
on
the
increase
the
age
we
are
about
to
enter
will
in
truth
be
the
era
of
crowds
scarcely
a
century
ago
the
traditional
policy
of
european
states
and
the
rivalries
of
sovereigns
were
the
principal
factors
that
shaped
events
the
opinion
of
the
masses
scarcely
counted
and
most
frequently
indeed
did
not
count
at
all
it
is
the
traditions
which
used
to
obtain
in
politics
and
the
individual
tendencies
and
rivalries
of
rulers
which
do
not
count
while
on
the
contrary
the
voice
of
the
masses
has
become
preponderant
it
is
this
voice
that
dictates
their
conduct
to
kings
whose
endeavour
is
to
take
note
of
its
utterances
the
destinies
of
nations
are
elaborated
at
present
in
the
heart
of
the
masses
and
no
longer
in
the
councils
of
princes
the
entry
of
the
popular
classes
into
political
life
that
is
to
say
in
reality
their
progressive
transformation
into
governing
classes
is
one
of
the
most
striking
characteristics
of
our
epoch
of
transition
the
introduction
of
universal
suffrage
which
exercised
for
a
long
time
but
little
influence
is
not
as
might
be
thought
the
distinguishing
feature
of
this
transference
of
political
power
the
progressive
growth
of
the
power
of
the
masses
took
place
at
first
by
the
propagation
of
certain
ideas
which
have
slowly
implanted
themselves
in
men
minds
and
afterwards
by
the
gradual
association
of
individuals
bent
on
bringing
about
the
realisation
of
theoretical
conceptions
it
is
by
association
that
crowds
have
come
to
procure
ideas
with
respect
to
their
interests
which
are
very
clearly
defined
if
not
particularly
just
and
have
arrived
at
a
consciousness
of
their
strength
the
masses
are
founding
syndicates
before
which
the
authorities
capitulate
one
after
the
other
they
are
also
founding
labour
unions
which
in
spite
of
all
economic
laws
tend
to
regulate
the
conditions
of
labour
and
wages
they
return
to
assemblies
in
which
the
government
is
vested
representatives
utterly
lacking
initiative
and
independence
and
reduced
most
often
to
nothing
else
than
the
spokesmen
of
the
committees
that
have
chosen
them
the
claims
of
the
masses
are
becoming
more
and
more
sharply
defined
and
amount
to
nothing
less
than
a
determination
to
utterly
destroy
society
as
it
now
exists
with
a
view
to
making
it
hark
back
to
that
primitive
communism
which
was
the
normal
condition
of
all
human
groups
before
the
dawn
of
civilisation
limitations
of
the
hours
of
labour
the
nationalisation
of
mines
railways
factories
and
the
soil
the
equal
distribution
of
all
products
the
elimination
of
all
the
upper
classes
for
the
benefit
of
the
popular
classes
such
are
these
claims
little
adapted
to
reasoning
crowds
on
the
contrary
are
quick
to
act
as
the
result
of
their
present
organisation
their
strength
has
become
immense
the
dogmas
whose
birth
we
are
witnessing
will
soon
have
the
force
of
the
old
dogmas
that
is
to
say
the
tyrannical
and
sovereign
force
of
being
above
discussion
the
divine
right
of
the
masses
is
about
to
replace
the
divine
right
of
kings
the
writers
who
enjoy
the
favour
of
our
middle
classes
those
who
best
represent
their
rather
narrow
ideas
their
somewhat
prescribed
views
their
rather
superficial
scepticism
and
their
at
times
somewhat
excessive
egoism
display
profound
alarm
at
this
new
power
which
they
see
growing
and
to
combat
the
disorder
in
men
minds
they
are
addressing
despairing
appeals
to
those
moral
forces
of
the
church
for
which
they
formerly
professed
so
much
disdain
they
talk
to
us
of
the
bankruptcy
of
science
go
back
in
penitence
to
rome
and
remind
us
of
the
teachings
of
revealed
truth
these
new
converts
forget
that
it
is
too
late
had
they
been
really
touched
by
grace
a
like
operation
could
not
have
the
same
influence
on
minds
less
concerned
with
the
preoccupations
which
beset
these
recent
adherents
to
religion
the
masses
repudiate
the
gods
which
their
admonishers
repudiated
yesterday
and
helped
to
destroy
there
is
no
power
divine
or
human
that
can
oblige
a
stream
to
flow
back
to
its
source
there
has
been
no
bankruptcy
of
science
and
science
has
had
no
share
in
the
present
intellectual
anarchy
nor
in
the
making
of
the
new
power
which
is
springing
up
in
the
midst
of
this
anarchy
science
promised
us
truth
or
at
least
a
knowledge
of
such
relations
as
our
intelligence
can
seize
it
never
promised
us
peace
or
happiness
sovereignly
indifferent
to
our
feelings
it
is
deaf
to
our
lamentations
it
is
for
us
to
endeavour
to
live
with
science
since
nothing
can
bring
back
the
illusions
it
has
destroyed
universal
symptoms
visible
in
all
nations
show
us
the
rapid
growth
of
the
power
of
crowds
and
do
not
admit
of
our
supposing
that
it
is
destined
to
cease
growing
at
an
early
date
whatever
fate
it
may
reserve
for
us
we
shall
have
to
submit
to
it
all
reasoning
against
it
is
a
mere
vain
war
of
words
certainly
it
is
possible
that
the
advent
to
power
of
the
masses
marks
one
of
the
last
stages
of
western
civilisation
a
complete
return
to
those
periods
of
confused
anarchy
which
seem
always
destined
to
precede
the
birth
of
every
new
society
but
may
this
result
be
prevented
up
to
now
these
thoroughgoing
destructions
of
a
civilisation
have
constituted
the
most
obvious
task
of
the
masses
it
is
not
indeed
merely
that
this
can
be
traced
history
tells
us
that
from
the
moment
when
the
moral
forces
on
which
a
civilisation
rested
have
lost
their
strength
its
final
dissolution
is
brought
about
by
those
unconscious
and
brutal
crowds
known
justifiably
enough
as
barbarians
civilisations
as
yet
have
only
been
created
and
directed
by
a
small
intellectual
aristocracy
never
by
crowds
crowds
are
only
powerful
for
destruction
their
rule
is
always
tantamount
to
a
barbarian
phase
a
civilisation
involves
fixed
rules
discipline
a
passing
from
the
instinctive
to
the
rational
state
forethought
for
the
future
an
elevated
degree
of
culture
all
of
them
conditions
that
crowds
left
to
themselves
have
invariably
shown
themselves
incapable
of
realising
in
consequence
of
the
purely
destructive
nature
of
their
power
crowds
act
like
those
microbes
which
hasten
the
dissolution
of
enfeebled
or
dead
bodies
when
the
structure
of
a
civilisation
is
rotten
it
is
always
the
masses
that
bring
about
its
downfall
it
is
at
such
a
juncture
that
their
chief
mission
is
plainly
visible
and
that
for
a
while
the
philosophy
of
number
seems
the
only
philosophy
of
history
is
the
same
fate
in
store
for
our
civilisation
there
is
ground
to
fear
that
this
is
the
case
but
we
are
not
as
yet
in
a
position
to
be
certain
of
it
however
this
may
be
we
are
bound
to
resign
ourselves
to
the
reign
of
the
masses
since
want
of
foresight
has
in
succession
overthrown
all
the
barriers
that
might
have
kept
the
crowd
in
check
we
have
a
very
slight
knowledge
of
these
crowds
which
are
beginning
to
be
the
object
of
so
much
discussion
professional
students
of
psychology
having
lived
far
from
them
have
always
ignored
them
and
when
as
of
late
they
have
turned
their
attention
in
this
direction
it
has
only
been
to
consider
the
crimes
crowds
are
capable
of
committing
without
a
doubt
criminal
crowds
exist
but
virtuous
and
heroic
crowds
and
crowds
of
many
other
kinds
are
also
to
be
met
with
the
crimes
of
crowds
only
constitute
a
particular
phase
of
their
psychology
the
mental
constitution
of
crowds
is
not
to
be
learnt
merely
by
a
study
of
their
crimes
any
more
than
that
of
an
individual
by
a
mere
description
of
his
vices
however
in
point
of
fact
all
the
world
masters
all
the
founders
of
religions
or
empires
the
apostles
of
all
beliefs
eminent
statesmen
and
in
a
more
modest
sphere
the
mere
chiefs
of
small
groups
of
men
have
always
been
unconscious
psychologists
possessed
of
an
instinctive
and
often
very
sure
knowledge
of
the
character
of
crowds
and
it
is
their
accurate
knowledge
of
this
character
that
has
enabled
them
to
so
easily
establish
their
mastery
napoleon
had
a
marvellous
insight
into
the
psychology
of
the
masses
of
the
country
over
which
he
reigned
but
he
at
times
completely
misunderstood
the
psychology
of
crowds
belonging
to
other
races
and
it
is
because
he
thus
misunderstood
it
that
he
engaged
in
spain
and
notably
in
russia
in
conflicts
in
which
his
power
received
blows
which
were
destined
within
a
brief
space
of
time
to
ruin
it
a
knowledge
of
the
psychology
of
crowds
is
the
last
resource
of
the
statesman
who
wishes
not
to
govern
them
that
is
becoming
a
very
difficult
matter
but
at
any
rate
not
to
be
too
much
governed
by
them
his
most
subtle
advisers
moreover
did
not
understand
this
psychology
any
better
talleyrand
wrote
him
that
spain
would
receive
his
soldiers
as
liberators
it
received
them
as
beasts
of
prey
a
psychologist
acquainted
with
the
hereditary
instincts
of
the
spanish
race
would
have
easily
foreseen
this
reception
it
is
only
by
obtaining
some
sort
of
insight
into
the
psychology
of
crowds
that
it
can
be
understood
how
slight
is
the
action
upon
them
of
laws
and
institutions
how
powerless
they
are
to
hold
any
opinions
other
than
those
which
are
imposed
upon
them
and
that
it
is
not
with
rules
based
on
theories
of
pure
equity
that
they
are
to
be
led
but
by
seeking
what
produces
an
impression
on
them
and
what
seduces
them
for
instance
should
a
legislator
wishing
to
impose
a
new
tax
choose
that
which
would
be
theoretically
the
most
just
by
no
means
in
practice
the
most
unjust
may
be
the
best
for
the
masses
should
it
at
the
same
time
be
the
least
obvious
and
apparently
the
least
burdensome
it
will
be
the
most
easily
tolerated
it
is
for
this
reason
that
an
indirect
tax
however
exorbitant
it
be
will
always
be
accepted
by
the
crowd
because
being
paid
daily
in
fractions
of
a
farthing
on
objects
of
consumption
it
will
not
interfere
with
the
habits
of
the
crowd
and
will
pass
unperceived
replace
it
by
a
proportional
tax
on
wages
or
income
of
any
other
kind
to
be
paid
in
a
lump
sum
and
were
this
new
imposition
theoretically
ten
times
less
burdensome
than
the
other
it
would
give
rise
to
unanimous
protest
this
arises
from
the
fact
that
a
sum
relatively
high
which
will
appear
immense
and
will
in
consequence
strike
the
imagination
has
been
substituted
for
the
unperceived
fractions
of
a
farthing
the
new
tax
would
only
appear
light
had
it
been
saved
farthing
by
farthing
but
this
economic
proceeding
involves
an
amount
of
foresight
of
which
the
masses
are
incapable
the
example
which
precedes
is
of
the
simplest
its
appositeness
will
be
easily
perceived
it
did
not
escape
the
attention
of
such
a
psychologist
as
napoleon
but
our
modern
legislators
ignorant
as
they
are
of
the
characteristics
of
a
crowd
are
unable
to
appreciate
it
experience
has
not
taught
them
as
yet
to
a
sufficient
degree
that
men
never
shape
their
conduct
upon
the
teaching
of
pure
reason
many
other
practical
applications
might
be
made
of
the
psychology
of
crowds
a
knowledge
of
this
science
throws
the
most
vivid
light
on
a
great
number
of
historical
and
economic
phenomena
totally
incomprehensible
without
it
i
shall
have
occasion
to
show
that
the
reason
why
the
most
remarkable
of
modern
historians
taine
has
at
times
so
imperfectly
understood
the
events
of
the
great
french
revolution
is
that
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
study
the
genius
of
crowds
he
took
as
his
guide
in
the
study
of
this
complicated
period
the
descriptive
method
resorted
to
by
naturalists
but
the
moral
forces
are
almost
absent
in
the
case
of
the
phenomena
which
naturalists
have
to
study
yet
it
is
precisely
these
forces
that
constitute
the
true
mainsprings
of
history
in
consequence
merely
looked
at
from
its
practical
side
the
study
of
the
psychology
of
crowds
deserved
to
be
attempted
were
its
interest
that
resulting
from
pure
curiosity
only
it
would
still
merit
attention
it
is
as
interesting
to
decipher
the
motives
of
the
actions
of
men
as
to
determine
the
characteristics
of
a
mineral
or
a
plant
our
study
of
the
genius
of
crowds
can
merely
be
a
brief
synthesis
a
simple
summary
of
our
investigations
nothing
more
must
be
demanded
of
it
than
a
few
suggestive
views
others
will
work
the
ground
more
thoroughly
we
only
touch

of

still
almost

i
general

unity
what
constitutes
a
crowd
from
the
psychological
point
of
view
a
numerically
strong
agglomeration
of
individuals
does
not
suffice
to
form
a
crowd
special
characteristics
of
psychological
crowds
the
turning
in
a
fixed
direction
of
the
ideas
and
sentiments
of
individuals
composing
such
a
crowd
and
the
disappearance
of
their
personality
the
crowd
is
always
dominated
by
considerations
of
which
it
is
unconscious
the
disappearance
of
brain
activity
and
the
predominance
of
medullar
activity
the
lowering
of
the
intelligence
and
the
complete
transformation
of
the
sentiments
the
transformed
sentiments
may
be
better
or
worse
than
those
of
the
individuals
of
which
the
crowd
is
composed
a
crowd
is
as
easily
heroic
as
criminal
in
its
ordinary
sense
the
word
crowd
means
a
gathering
of
individuals
of
whatever
nationality
profession
or
sex
and
whatever
be
the
chances
that
have
brought
them
together
from
the
psychological
point
of
view
the
expression
crowd
assumes
quite
a
different
signification
under
certain
given
circumstances
and
only
under
those
circumstances
an
agglomeration
of
men
presents
new
characteristics
very
different
from
those
of
the
individuals
composing
it
the
sentiments
and
ideas
of
all
the
persons
in
the
gathering
take
one
and
the
same
direction
and
their
conscious
personality
vanishes
a
collective
mind
is
formed
doubtless
transitory
but
presenting
very
clearly
defined
characteristics
the
gathering
has
thus
become
what
in
the
absence
of
a
better
expression
i
will
call
an
organised
crowd
or
if
the
term
is
considered
preferable
a
psychological
crowd
it
forms
a
single
being
and
is
subjected
to
the
law
of
the
mental
unity
of
crowds
it
is
evident
that
it
is
not
by
the
mere
fact
of
a
number
of
individuals
finding
themselves
accidentally
side
by
side
that
they
acquire
the
character
of
an
organised
crowd
a
thousand
individuals
accidentally
gathered
in
a
public
place
without
any
determined
object
in
no
way
constitute
a
crowd
from
the
psychological
point
of
view
to
acquire
the
special
characteristics
of
such
a
crowd
the
influence
is
necessary
of
certain
predisposing
causes
of
which
we
shall
have
to
determine
the
nature
the
disappearance
of
conscious
personality
and
the
turning
of
feelings
and
thoughts
in
a
definite
direction
which
are
the
primary
characteristics
of
a
crowd
about
to
become
organised
do
not
always
involve
the
simultaneous
presence
of
a
number
of
individuals
on
one
spot
thousands
of
isolated
individuals
may
acquire
at
certain
moments
and
under
the
influence
of
certain
violent
emotions
such
for
example
as
a
great
national
event
the
characteristics
of
a
psychological
crowd
it
will
be
sufficient
in
that
case
that
a
mere
chance
should
bring
them
together
for
their
acts
to
at
once
assume
the
characteristics
peculiar
to
the
acts
of
a
crowd
at
certain
moments
half
a
dozen
men
might
constitute
a
psychological
crowd
which
may
not
happen
in
the
case
of
hundreds
of
men
gathered
together
by
accident
on
the
other
hand
an
entire
nation
though
there
may
be
no
visible
agglomeration
may
become
a
crowd
under
the
action
of
certain
influences
a
psychological
crowd
once
constituted
it
acquires
certain
provisional
but
determinable
general
characteristics
to
these
general
characteristics
there
are
adjoined
particular
characteristics
which
vary
according
to
the
elements
of
which
the
crowd
is
composed
and
may
modify
its
mental
constitution
psychological
crowds
then
are
susceptible
of
classification
and
when
we
come
to
occupy
ourselves
with
this
matter
we
shall
see
that
a
heterogeneous
crowd
that
is
a
crowd
composed
of
dissimilar
elements
presents
certain
characteristics
in
common
with
homogeneous
crowds
that
is
with
crowds
composed
of
elements
more
or
less
akin
sects
castes
and
classes
and
side
by
side
with
these
common
characteristics
particularities
which
permit
of
the
two
kinds
of
crowds
being
differentiated
but
before
occupying
ourselves
with
the
different
categories
of
crowds
we
must
first
of
all
examine
the
characteristics
common
to
them
all
we
shall
set
to
work
like
the
naturalist
who
begins
by
describing
the
general
characteristics
common
to
all
the
members
of
a
family
before
concerning
himself
with
the
particular
characteristics
which
allow
the
differentiation
of
the
genera
and
species
that
the
family
includes
it
is
not
easy
to
describe
the
mind
of
crowds
with
exactness
because
its
organisation
varies
not
only
according
to
race
and
composition
but
also
according
to
the
nature
and
intensity
of
the
exciting
causes
to
which
crowds
are
subjected
the
same
difficulty
however
presents
itself
in
the
psychological
study
of
an
individual
it
is
only
in
novels
that
individuals
are
found
to
traverse
their
whole
life
with
an
unvarying
character
it
is
only
the
uniformity
of
the
environment
that
creates
the
apparent
uniformity
of
characters
i
have
shown
elsewhere
that
all
mental
constitutions
contain
possibilities
of
character
which
may
be
manifested
in
consequence
of
a
sudden
change
of
environment
this
explains
how
it
was
that
among
the
most
savage
members
of
the
french
convention
were
to
be
found
inoffensive
citizens
who
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
have
been
peaceable
notaries
or
virtuous
magistrates
the
storm
past
they
resumed
their
normal
character
of
quiet
citizens
napoleon
found
amongst
them
his
most
docile
servants
it
being
impossible
to
study
here
all
the
successive
degrees
of
organisation
of
crowds
we
shall
concern
ourselves
more
especially
with
such
crowds
as
have
attained
to
the
phase
of
complete
organisation
in
this
way
we
shall
see
what
crowds
may
become
but
not
what
they
invariably
are
it
is
only
in
this
advanced
phase
of
organisation
that
certain
new
and
special
characteristics
are
superposed
on
the
unvarying
and
dominant
character
of
the
race
then
takes
place
that
turning
already
alluded
to
of
all
the
feelings
and
thoughts
of
the
collectivity
in
an
identical
direction
it
is
only
under
such
circumstances
too
that
what
i
have
called
above
the
psychological
law
of
the
mental
unity
of
crowds
comes
into
play
among
the
psychological
characteristics
of
crowds
there
are
some
that
they
may
present
in
common
with
isolated
individuals
and
others
on
the
contrary
which
are
absolutely
peculiar
to
them
and
are
only
to
be
met
with
in
collectivities
it
is
these
special
characteristics
that
we
shall
study
first
of
all
in
order
to
show
their
importance
the
most
striking
peculiarity
presented
by
a
psychological
crowd
is
the
following
whoever
be
the
individuals
that
compose
it
however
like
or
unlike
be
their
mode
of
life
their
occupations
their
character
or
their
intelligence
the
fact
that
they
have
been
transformed
into
a
crowd
puts
them
in
possession
of
a
sort
of
collective
mind
which
makes
them
feel
think
and
act
in
a
manner
quite
different
from
that
in
which
each
individual
of
them
would
feel
think
and
act
were
he
in
a
state
of
isolation
there
are
certain
ideas
and
feelings
which
do
not
come
into
being
or
do
not
transform
themselves
into
acts
except
in
the
case
of
individuals
forming
a
crowd
the
psychological
crowd
is
a
provisional
being
formed
of
heterogeneous
elements
which
for
a
moment
are
combined
exactly
as
the
cells
which
constitute
a
living
body
form
by
their
reunion
a
new
being
which
displays
characteristics
very
different
from
those
possessed
by
each
of
the
cells
singly
contrary
to
an
opinion
which
one
is
astonished
to
find
coming
from
the
pen
of
so
acute
a
philosopher
as
herbert
spencer
in
the
aggregate
which
constitutes
a
crowd
there
is
in
no
sort
a
of
or
an
average
struck
between
its
elements
what
really
takes
place
is
a
combination
followed
by
the
creation
of
new
characteristics
just
as
in
chemistry
certain
elements
when
brought
into
contact
bases
and
acids
for
example
combine
to
form
a
new
body
possessing
properties
quite
different
from
those
of
the
bodies
that
have
served
to
form
it
it
is
easy
to
prove
how
much
the
individual
forming
part
of
a
crowd
differs
from
the
isolated
individual
but
it
is
less
easy
to
discover
the
causes
of
this
difference
to
obtain
at
any
rate
a
glimpse
of
them
it
is
necessary
in
the
first
place
to
call
to
mind
the
truth
established
by
modern
psychology
that
unconscious
phenomena
play
an
altogether
preponderating
part
not
only
in
organic
life
but
also
in
the
operations
of
the
intelligence
the
conscious
life
of
the
mind
is
of
small
importance
in
comparison
with
its
unconscious
life
the
most
subtle
analyst
the
most
acute
observer
is
scarcely
successful
in
discovering
more
than
a
very
small
number
of
the
unconscious
motives
that
determine
his
conduct
our
conscious
acts
are
the
outcome
of
an
unconscious
substratum
created
in
the
mind
in
the
main
by
hereditary
influences
this
substratum
consists
of
the
innumerable
common
characteristics
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
which
constitute
the
genius
of
a
race
behind
the
avowed
causes
of
our
acts
there
undoubtedly
lie
secret
causes
that
we
do
not
avow
but
behind
these
secret
causes
there
are
many
others
more
secret
still
which
we
ourselves
ignore
the
greater
part
of
our
daily
actions
are
the
result
of
hidden
motives
which
escape
our
observation
it
is
more
especially
with
respect
to
those
unconscious
elements
which
constitute
the
genius
of
a
race
that
all
the
individuals
belonging
to
it
resemble
each
other
while
it
is
principally
in
respect
to
the
conscious
elements
of
their
character
the
fruit
of
education
and
yet
more
of
exceptional
hereditary
conditions
that
they
differ
from
each
other
men
the
most
unlike
in
the
matter
of
their
intelligence
possess
instincts
passions
and
feelings
that
are
very
similar
in
the
case
of
every
thing
that
belongs
to
the
realm
of
sentiment
religion
politics
morality
the
affections
and
antipathies
the
most
eminent
men
seldom
surpass
the
standard
of
the
most
ordinary
individuals
from
the
intellectual
point
of
view
an
abyss
may
exist
between
a
great
mathematician
and
his
boot
maker
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
character
the
difference
is
most
often
slight
or
it
is
precisely
these
general
qualities
of
character
governed
by
forces
of
which
we
are
unconscious
and
possessed
by
the
majority
of
the
normal
individuals
of
a
race
in
much
the
same
degree
it
is
precisely
these
qualities
i
say
that
in
crowds
become
common
property
in
the
collective
mind
the
intellectual
aptitudes
of
the
individuals
and
in
consequence
their
individuality
are
weakened
the
heterogeneous
is
swamped
by
the
homogeneous
and
the
unconscious
qualities
obtain
the
upper
hand
this
very
fact
that
crowds
possess
in
common
ordinary
qualities
explains
why
they
can
never
accomplish
acts
demanding
a
high
degree
of
intelligence
the
decisions
affecting
matters
of
general
interest
come
to
by
an
assembly
of
men
of
distinction
but
specialists
in
different
walks
of
life
are
not
sensibly
superior
to
the
decisions
that
would
be
adopted
by
a
gathering
of
imbeciles
the
truth
is
they
can
only
bring
to
bear
in
common
on
the
work
in
hand
those
mediocre
qualities
which
are
the
birthright
of
every
average
individual
in
crowds
it
is
stupidity
and
not
that
is
accumulated
it
is
not
all
the
world
as
is
so
often
repeated
that
has
more
wit
than
voltaire
but
assuredly
voltaire
that
has
more
wit
than
all
the
world
if
by
all
the
world
crowds
are
to
be
understood
if
the
individuals
of
a
crowd
confined
themselves
to
putting
in
common
the
ordinary
qualities
of
which
each
of
them
has
his
share
there
would
merely
result
the
striking
of
an
average
and
not
as
we
have
said
is
actually
the
case
the
creation
of
new
characteristics
how
is
it
that
these
new
characteristics
are
created
this
is
what
we
are
now
to
investigate
different
causes
determine
the
appearance
of
these
characteristics
peculiar
to
crowds
and
not
possessed
by
isolated
individuals
the
first
is
that
the
individual
forming
part
of
a
crowd
acquires
solely
from
numerical
considerations
a
sentiment
of
invincible
power
which
allows
him
to
yield
to
instincts
which
had
he
been
alone
he
would
perforce
have
kept
under
restraint
he
will
be
the
less
disposed
to
check
himself
from
the
consideration
that
a
crowd
being
anonymous
and
in
consequence
irresponsible
the
sentiment
of
responsibility
which
always
controls
individuals
disappears
entirely
the
second
cause
which
is
contagion
also
intervenes
to
determine
the
manifestation
in
crowds
of
their
special
characteristics
and
at
the
same
time
the
trend
they
are
to
take
contagion
is
a
phenomenon
of
which
it
is
easy
to
establish
the
presence
but
that
it
is
not
easy
to
explain
it
must
be
classed
among
those
phenomena
of
a
hypnotic
order
which
we
shall
shortly
study
in
a
crowd
every
sentiment
and
act
is
contagious
and
contagious
to
such
a
degree
that
an
individual
readily
sacrifices
his
personal
interest
to
the
collective
interest
this
is
an
aptitude
very
contrary
to
his
nature
and
of
which
a
man
is
scarcely
capable
except
when
he
makes
part
of
a
crowd
a
third
cause
and
by
far
the
most
important
determines
in
the
individuals
of
a
crowd
special
characteristics
which
are
quite
contrary
at
times
to
those
presented
by
the
isolated
individual
i
allude
to
that
suggestibility
of
which
moreover
the
contagion
mentioned
above
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
an
effect
to
understand
this
phenomenon
it
is
necessary
to
bear
in
mind
certain
recent
physiological
discoveries
we
know
that
by
various
processes
an
individual
may
be
brought
into
such
a
condition
that
having
entirely
lost
his
conscious
personality
he
obeys
all
the
suggestions
of
the
operator
who
has
deprived
him
of
it
and
commits
acts
in
utter
contradiction
with
his
character
and
habits
the
most
careful
observations
seem
to
prove
that
an
individual
immerged
for
some
length
of
time
in
a
crowd
in
action
soon
finds
himself
either
in
consequence
of
the
magnetic
influence
given
out
by
the
crowd
or
from
some
other
cause
of
which
we
are
ignorant
in
a
special
state
which
much
resembles
the
state
of
fascination
in
which
the
hypnotised
individual
finds
himself
in
the
hands
of
the
hypnotiser
the
activity
of
the
brain
being
paralysed
in
the
case
of
the
hypnotised
subject
the
latter
becomes
the
slave
of
all
the
unconscious
activities
of
his
spinal
cord
which
the
hypnotiser
directs
at
will
the
conscious
personality
has
entirely
vanished
will
and
discernment
are
lost
all
feelings
and
thoughts
are
bent
in
the
direction
determined
by
the
hypnotiser
such
also
is
approximately
the
state
of
the
individual
forming
part
of
a
psychological
crowd
he
is
no
longer
conscious
of
his
acts
in
his
case
as
in
the
case
of
the
hypnotised
subject
at
the
same
time
that
certain
faculties
are
destroyed
others
may
be
brought
to
a
high
degree
of
exaltation
under
the
influence
of
a
suggestion
he
will
undertake
the
accomplishment
of
certain
acts
with
irresistible
impetuosity
this
impetuosity
is
the
more
irresistible
in
the
case
of
crowds
than
in
that
of
the
hypnotised
subject
from
the
fact
that
the
suggestion
being
the
same
for
all
the
individuals
of
the
crowd
it
gains
in
strength
by
reciprocity
the
individualities
in
the
crowd
who
might
possess
a
personality
sufficiently
strong
to
resist
the
suggestion
are
too
few
in
number
to
struggle
against
the
current
at
the
utmost
they
may
be
able
to
attempt
a
diversion
by
means
of
different
suggestions
it
is
in
this
way
for
instance
that
a
happy
expression
an
image
opportunely
evoked
have
occasionally
deterred
crowds
from
the
most
bloodthirsty
acts
we
see
then
that
the
disappearance
of
the
conscious
personality
the
predominance
of
the
unconscious
personality
the
turning
by
means
of
suggestion
and
contagion
of
feelings
and
ideas
in
an
identical
direction
the
tendency
to
immediately
transform
the
suggested
ideas
into
acts
these
we
see
are
the
principal
characteristics
of
the
individual
forming
part
of
a
crowd
he
is
no
longer
himself
but
has
become
an
automaton
who
has
ceased
to
be
guided
by
his
will
moreover
by
the
mere
fact
that
he
forms
part
of
an
organised
crowd
a
man
descends
several
rungs
in
the
ladder
of
civilisation
isolated
he
may
be
a
cultivated
individual
in
a
crowd
he
is
a
barbarian
that
is
a
creature
acting
by
instinct
he
possesses
the
spontaneity
the
violence
the
ferocity
and
also
the
enthusiasm
and
heroism
of
primitive
beings
whom
he
further
tends
to
resemble
by
the
facility
with
which
he
allows
himself
to
be
impressed
by
words
and
images
which
would
be
entirely
without
action
on
each
of
the
isolated
individuals
composing
the
crowd
and
to
be
induced
to
commit
acts
contrary
to
his
most
obvious
interests
and
his
habits
an
individual
in
a
crowd
is
a
grain
of
sand
amid
other
grains
of
sand
which
the
wind
stirs
up
at
will
it
is
for
these
reasons
that
juries
are
seen
to
deliver
verdicts
of
which
each
individual
juror
would
disapprove
that
parliamentary
assemblies
adopt
laws
and
measures
of
which
each
of
their
members
would
disapprove
in
his
own
person
taken
separately
the
men
of
the
convention
were
enlightened
citizens
of
peaceful
habits
united
in
a
crowd
they
did
not
hesitate
to
give
their
adhesion
to
the
most
savage
proposals
to
guillotine
individuals
most
clearly
innocent
and
contrary
to
their
interests
to
renounce
their
inviolability
and
to
decimate
themselves
it
is
not
only
by
his
acts
that
the
individual
in
a
crowd
differs
essentially
from
himself
even
before
he
has
entirely
lost
his
independence
his
ideas
and
feelings
have
undergone
a
transformation
and
the
transformation
is
so
profound
as
to
change
the
miser
into
a
spendthrift
the
sceptic
into
a
believer
the
honest
man
into
a
criminal
and
the
coward
into
a
hero
the
renunciation
of
all
its
privileges
which
the
nobility
voted
in
a
moment
of
enthusiasm
during
the
celebrated
night
of
august
would
certainly
never
have
been
consented
to
by
any
of
its
members
taken
singly
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
what
precedes
is
that
the
crowd
is
always
intellectually
inferior
to
the
isolated
individual
but
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
feelings
and
of
the
acts
these
feelings
provoke
the
crowd
may
according
to
circumstances
he
better
or
worse
than
the
individual
all
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
suggestion
to
which
the
crowd
is
exposed
this
is
the
point
that
has
been
completely
misunderstood
by
writers
who
have
only
studied
crowds
from
the
criminal
point
of
view
doubtless
a
crowd
is
often
criminal
but
also
it
is
often
heroic
it
is
crowds
rather
than
isolated
individuals
that
may
be
induced
to
run
the
risk
of
death
to
secure
the
triumph
of
a
creed
or
an
idea
that
may
be
fired
with
enthusiasm
for
glory
and
honour
that
are
led
on
almost
without
bread
and
without
arms
as
in
the
age
of
the
crusades
to
deliver
the
tomb
of
christ
from
the
infidel
or
as
in
to
defend
the
fatherland
such
heroism
is
without
doubt
somewhat
unconscious
but
it
is
of
such
heroism
that
history
is
made
were
peoples
only
to
be
credited
with
the
great
actions
performed
in
cold
blood
the
annals
of
the
world
would
register
but

is
one
of
the
worst
proofs
that
can

invoked
to
establish

fact

slight

of

of

rarely

considerations

are

often

exclusive
motives
of
the
isolated
individual
the
moralising
role
of
crowds
having
indicated
in
a
general
way
the
principal
characteristics
of
crowds
it
remains
to
study
these
characteristics
in
detail
it
will
be
remarked
that
among
the
special
characteristics
of
crowds
there
are
several
such
as
impulsiveness
irritability
incapacity
to
reason
the
absence
of
judgment
and
of
the
critical
spirit
the
exaggeration
of
the
sentiments
and
others
besides
which
are
almost
always
observed
in
beings
belonging
to
inferior
forms
of
evolution
in
women
savages
and
children
for
instance
however
i
merely
indicate
this
analogy
in
passing
its
demonstration
is
outside
the
scope
of
this
work
it
would
moreover
be
useless
for
persons
acquainted
with
the
psychology
of
primitive
beings
and
would
scarcely
carry
conviction
to
those
in
ignorance
of
this
matter
i
now
proceed
to
the
successive
consideration
of
the
different
characteristics
that
may
be
observed
in
the
majority
of
crowds
impulsiveness
mobility
and
irritability
of
crowds
when
studying
the
fundamental
characteristics
of
a
crowd
we
stated
that
it
is
guided
almost
exclusively
by
unconscious
motives
its
acts
are
far
more
under
the
influence
of
the
spinal
cord
than
of
the
brain
in
this
respect
a
crowd
is
closely
akin
to
quite
primitive
beings
the
acts
performed
may
be
perfect
so
far
as
their
execution
is
concerned
but
as
they
are
not
directed
by
the
brain
the
individual
conducts
himself
according
as
the
exciting
causes
to
which
he
is
submitted
may
happen
to
decide
a
crowd
is
at
the
mercy
of
all
external
exciting
causes
and
reflects
their
incessant
variations
it
is
the
slave
of
the
impulses
which
it
receives
the
isolated
individual
may
be
submitted
to
the
same
exciting
causes
as
the
man
in
a
crowd
but
as
his
brain
shows
him
the
inadvisability
of
yielding
to
them
he
refrains
from
yielding
this
truth
may
be
physiologically
expressed
by
saying
that
the
isolated
individual
possesses
the
capacity
of
dominating
his
reflex
actions
while
a
crowd
is
devoid
of
this
capacity
the
varying
impulses
to
which
crowds
obey
may
be
according
to
their
exciting
causes
generous
or
cruel
heroic
or
cowardly
but
they
will
always
be
so
imperious
that
the
interest
of
the
individual
even
the
interest
of
will
not
dominate
them
the
exciting
causes
that
may
act
on
crowds
being
so
varied
and
crowds
always
obeying
them
crowds
are
in
consequence
extremely
mobile
this
explains
how
it
is
that
we
see
them
pass
in
a
moment
from
the
most
bloodthirsty
ferocity
to
the
most
extreme
generosity
and
heroism
a
crowd
may
easily
enact
the
part
of
an
executioner
but
not
less
easily
that
of
a
martyr
it
is
crowds
that
have
furnished
the
torrents
of
blood
requisite
for
the
triumph
of
every
belief
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
back
to
the
heroic
ages
to
see
what
crowds
are
capable
of
in
this
latter
direction
they
are
never
sparing
of
their
life
in
an
insurrection
and
not
long
since
a
general
becoming
suddenly
popular
might
easily
have
found
a
hundred
thousand
men
ready
to
sacrifice
their
lives
for
his
cause
had
he
demanded
it
general
boulanger
any
display
of
premeditation
by
crowds
is
in
consequence
out
of
the
question
they
may
be
animated
in
succession
by
the
most
contrary
sentiments
but
they
will
always
be
under
the
influence
of
the
exciting
causes
of
the
moment
they
are
like
the
leaves
which
a
tempest
whirls
up
and
scatters
in
every
direction
and
then
allows
to
fall
when
studying
later
on
certain
revolutionary
crowds
we
shall
give
some
examples
of
the
variability
of
their
sentiments
this
mobility
of
crowds
renders
them
very
difficult
to
govern
especially
when
a
measure
of
public
authority
has
fallen
into
their
hands
did
not
the
necessities
of
everyday
life
constitute
a
sort
of
invisible
regulator
of
existence
it
would
scarcely
be
possible
for
democracies
to
last
still
though
the
wishes
of
crowds
are
frenzied
they
are
not
durable
crowds
are
as
incapable
of
willing
as
of
thinking
for
any
length
of
time
a
crowd
is
not
merely
impulsive
and
mobile
like
a
savage
it
is
not
prepared
to
admit
that
anything
can
come
between
its
desire
and
the
realisation
of
its
desire
it
is
the
less
capable
of
understanding
such
an
intervention
in
consequence
of
the
feeling
of
irresistible
power
given
it
by
its
numerical
strength
the
notion
of
impossibility
disappears
for
the
individual
in
a
crowd
an
isolated
individual
knows
well
enough
that
alone
he
can
not
set
fire
to
a
palace
or
loot
a
shop
and
should
he
be
tempted
to
do
so
he
will
easily
resist
the
temptation
making
part
of
a
crowd
he
is
conscious
of
the
power
given
him
by
number
and
it
is
sufficient
to
suggest
to
him
ideas
of
murder
or
pillage
for
him
to
yield
immediately
to
temptation
an
unexpected
obstacle
will
be
destroyed
with
frenzied
rage
did
the
human
organism
allow
of
the
perpetuity
of
furious
passion
it
might
be
said
that
the
normal
condition
of
a
crowd
baulked
in
its
wishes
is
just
such
a
state
of
furious
passion
the
fundamental
characteristics
of
the
race
which
constitute
the
unvarying
source
from
which
all
our
sentiments
spring
always
exert
an
influence
on
the
irritability
of
crowds
their
impulsiveness
and
their
mobility
as
on
all
the
popular
sentiments
we
shall
have
to
study
all
crowds
are
doubtless
always
irritable
and
impulsive
but
with
great
variations
of
degree
for
instance
the
difference
between
a
latin
and
an
crowd
is
striking
the
most
recent
facts
in
french
history
throw
a
vivid
light
on
this
point
the
mere
publication
years
ago
of
a
telegram
relating
an
insult
supposed
to
have
been
offered
an
ambassador
was
sufficient
to
determine
an
explosion
of
fury
whence
followed
immediately
a
terrible
war
some
years
later
the
telegraphic
announcement
of
an
insignificant
reverse
at
langson
provoked
a
fresh
explosion
which
brought
about
the
instantaneous
overthrow
of
the
government
at
the
same
moment
a
much
more
serious
reverse
undergone
by
the
english
expedition
to
khartoum
produced
only
a
slight
emotion
in
england
and
no
ministry
was
overturned
crowds
are
everywhere
distinguished
by
feminine
characteristics
but
latin
crowds
are
the
most
feminine
of
all
whoever
trusts
in
them
may
rapidly
attain
a
lofty
destiny
but
to
do
so
is
to
be
perpetually
skirting
the
brink
of
a
tarpeian
rock
with
the
certainty
of
one
day
being
precipitated
from
it
the
suggestibility
and
credulity
of
crowds
when
defining
crowds
we
said
that
one
of
their
general
characteristics
was
an
excessive
suggestibility
and
we
have
shown
to
what
an
extent
suggestions
are
contagious
in
every
human
agglomeration
a
fact
which
explains
the
rapid
turning
of
the
sentiments
of
a
crowd
in
a
definite
direction
however
indifferent
it
may
be
supposed
a
crowd
as
a
rule
is
in
a
state
of
expectant
attention
which
renders
suggestion
easy
the
first
suggestion
formulated
which
arises
implants
itself
immediately
by
a
process
of
contagion
in
the
brains
of
all
assembled
and
the
identical
bent
of
the
sentiments
of
the
crowd
is
immediately
an
accomplished
fact
as
is
the
case
with
all
persons
under
the
influence
of
suggestion
the
idea
which
has
entered
the
brain
tends
to
transform
itself
into
an
act
whether
the
act
is
that
of
setting
fire
to
a
palace
or
involves
a
crowd
lends
itself
to
it
with
equal
facility
all
will
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
exciting
cause
and
no
longer
as
in
the
case
of
the
isolated
individual
on
the
relations
existing
between
the
act
suggested
and
the
sum
total
of
the
reasons
which
may
be
urged
against
its
realisation
in
consequence
a
crowd
perpetually
hovering
on
the
borderland
of
unconsciousness
readily
yielding
to
all
suggestions
having
all
the
violence
of
feeling
peculiar
to
beings
who
can
not
appeal
to
the
influence
of
reason
deprived
of
all
critical
faculty
can
not
be
otherwise
than
excessively
credulous
the
improbable
does
not
exist
for
a
crowd
and
it
is
necessary
to
bear
this
circumstance
well
in
mind
to
understand
the
facility
with
which
are
created
and
propagated
the
most
improbable
legends
and
stories
persons
who
went
through
the
siege
of
paris
saw
numerous
examples
of
this
credulity
of
crowds
a
candle
alight
in
an
upper
story
was
immediately
looked
upon
as
a
signal
given
the
besiegers
although
it
was
evident
after
a
moment
of
reflection
that
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
catch
sight
of
the
light
of
the
candle
at
a
distance
of
several
miles
the
creation
of
the
legends
which
so
easily
obtain
circulation
in
crowds
is
not
solely
the
consequence
of
their
extreme
credulity
it
is
also
the
result
of
the
prodigious
perversions
that
events
undergo
in
the
imagination
of
a
throng
the
simplest
event
that
comes
under
the
observation
of
a
crowd
is
soon
totally
transformed
a
crowd
thinks
in
images
and
the
image
itself
immediately
calls
up
a
series
of
other
images
having
no
logical
connection
with
the
first
we
can
easily
conceive
this
state
by
thinking
of
the
fantastic
succession
of
ideas
to
which
we
are
sometimes
led
by
calling
up
in
our
minds
any
fact
our
reason
shows
us
the
incoherence
there
is
in
these
images
but
a
crowd
is
almost
blind
to
this
truth
and
confuses
with
the
real
event
what
the
deforming
action
of
its
imagination
has
superimposed
thereon
a
crowd
scarcely
distinguishes
between
the
subjective
and
the
objective
it
accepts
as
real
the
images
evoked
in
its
mind
though
they
most
often
have
only
a
very
distant
relation
with
the
observed
fact
the
ways
in
which
a
crowd
perverts
any
event
of
which
it
is
a
witness
ought
it
would
seem
to
be
innumerable
and
unlike
each
other
since
the
individuals
composing
the
gathering
are
of
very
different
temperaments
but
this
is
not
the
case
as
the
result
of
contagion
the
perversions
are
of
the
same
kind
and
take
the
same
shape
in
the
case
of
all
the
assembled
individuals
the
first
perversion
of
the
truth
effected
by
one
of
the
individuals
of
the
gathering
is
the
of
the
contagious
suggestion
before
george
appeared
on
the
walls
of
jerusalem
to
all
the
crusaders
he
was
certainly
perceived
in
the
first
instance
by
one
of
those
present
by
dint
of
suggestion
and
contagion
the
miracle
signalised
by
a
single
person
was
immediately
accepted
by
all
such
is
always
the
mechanism
of
the
collective
hallucinations
so
frequent
in
history
hallucinations
which
seem
to
have
all
the
recognised
characteristics
of
authenticity
since
they
are
phenomena
observed
by
thousands
of
persons
to
combat
what
precedes
the
mental
quality
of
the
individuals
composing
a
crowd
must
not
be
brought
into
consideration
this
quality
is
without
importance
from
the
moment
that
they
form
part
of
a
crowd
the
learned
man
and
the
ignoramus
are
equally
incapable
of
observation
this
thesis
may
seem
paradoxical
to
demonstrate
it
beyond
doubt
it
would
be
necessary
to
investigate
a
great
number
of
historical
facts
and
several
volumes
would
be
insufficient
for
the
purpose
still
as
i
do
not
wish
to
leave
the
reader
under
the
impression
of
unproved
assertions
i
shall
give
him
some
examples
taken
at
hazard
from
the
immense
number
of
those
that
might
be
quoted
the
following
fact
is
one
of
the
most
typical
because
chosen
from
among
collective
hallucinations
of
which
a
crowd
is
the
victim
in
which
are
to
be
found
individuals
of
every
kind
from
the
most
ignorant
to
the
most
highly
educated
it
is
related
incidentally
by
julian
felix
a
naval
lieutenant
in
his
book
on
sea
currents
and
has
been
previously
cited
by
the
revue
scientifique
the
frigate
the
belle
poule
was
cruising
in
the
open
sea
for
the
purpose
of
finding
the
cruiser
le
berceau
from
which
she
had
been
separated
by
a
violent
storm
it
was
broad
daylight
and
in
full
sunshine
suddenly
the
watch
signalled
a
disabled
vessel
the
crew
looked
in
the
direction
signalled
and
every
one
officers
and
sailors
clearly
perceived
a
raft
covered
with
men
towed
by
boats
which
were
displaying
signals
of
distress
yet
this
was
nothing
more
than
a
collective
hallucination
admiral
desfosses
lowered
a
boat
to
go
to
the
rescue
of
the
wrecked
sailors
on
nearing
the
object
sighted
the
sailors
and
officers
on
board
the
boat
saw
masses
of
men
in
motion
stretching
out
their
hands
and
heard
the
dull
and
confused
noise
of
a
great
number
of
voices
when
the
object
was
reached
those
in
the
boat
found
themselves
simply
and
solely
in
the
presence
of
a
few
branches
of
trees
covered
with
leaves
that
had
been
swept
out
from
the
neighbouring
coast
before
evidence
so
palpable
the
hallucination
vanished
the
mechanism
of
a
collective
hallucination
of
the
kind
we
have
explained
is
clearly
seen
at
work
in
this
example
on
the
one
hand
we
have
a
crowd
in
a
state
of
expectant
attention
on
the
other
a
suggestion
made
by
the
watch
signalling
a
disabled
vessel
at
sea
a
suggestion
which
by
a
process
of
contagion
was
accepted
by
all
those
present
both
officers
and
sailors
it
is
not
necessary
that
a
crowd
should
be
numerous
for
the
faculty
of
seeing
what
is
taking
place
before
its
eyes
to
be
destroyed
and
for
the
real
facts
to
be
replaced
by
hallucinations
unrelated
to
them
as
soon
as
a
few
individuals
are
gathered
together
they
constitute
a
crowd
and
though
they
should
be
distinguished
men
of
learning
they
assume
all
the
characteristics
of
crowds
with
regard
to
matters
outside
their
speciality
the
faculty
of
observation
and
the
critical
spirit
possessed
by
each
of
them
individually
at
once
disappears
an
ingenious
psychologist
davey
supplies
us
with
a
very
curious
example
in
point
recently
cited
in
the
annales
des
sciences
psychiques
and
deserving
of
relation
here
davey
having
convoked
a
gathering
of
distinguished
observers
among
them
one
of
the
most
prominent
of
english
scientific
men
wallace
executed
in
their
presence
and
after
having
allowed
them
to
examine
the
objects
and
to
place
seals
where
they
wished
all
the
regulation
spiritualistic
phenomena
the
materialisation
of
spirits
writing
on
slates
having
subsequently
obtained
from
these
distinguished
observers
written
reports
admitting
that
the
phenomena
observed
could
only
have
been
obtained
by
supernatural
means
he
revealed
to
them
that
they
were
the
result
of
very
simple
tricks
the
most
astonishing
feature
of
monsieur
davey
investigation
writes
the
author
of
this
account
is
not
the
marvellousness
of
the
tricks
themselves
but
the
extreme
weakness
of
the
reports
made
with
respect
to
them
by
the
noninitiated
witnesses
it
is
clear
then
he
says
that
witnesses
even
in
number
may
give
circumstantial
relations
which
are
completely
erroneous
but
whose
result
is
that
if
their
descriptions
are
accepted
as
exact
the
phenomena
they
describe
are
inexplicable
by
trickery
the
methods
invented
by
davey
were
so
simple
that
one
is
astonished
that
he
should
have
had
the
boldness
to
employ
them
but
he
had
such
a
power
over
the
mind
of
the
crowd
that
he
could
persuade
it
that
it
saw
what
it
did
not
see
here
as
always
we
have
the
power
of
the
hypnotiser
over
the
hypnotised
moreover
when
this
power
is
seen
in
action
on
minds
of
a
superior
order
and
previously
invited
to
be
suspicious
it
is
understandable
how
easy
it
is
to
deceive
ordinary
crowds
analogous
examples
are
innumerable
as
i
write
these
lines
the
papers
are
full
of
the
story
of
two
little
girls
found
drowned
in
the
seine
these
children
to
begin
with
were
recognised
in
the
most
unmistakable
manner
by
half
a
dozen
witnesses
all
the
affirmations
were
in
such
entire
concordance
that
no
doubt
remained
in
the
mind
of
the
juge
he
had
the
certificate
of
death
drawn
up
but
just
as
the
burial
of
the
children
was
to
have
been
proceeded
with
a
mere
chance
brought
about
the
discovery
that
the
supposed
victims
were
alive
and
had
moreover
but
a
remote
resemblance
to
the
drowned
girls
as
in
several
of
the
examples
previously
cited
the
affirmation
of
the
first
witness
himself
a
victim
of
illusion
had
sufficed
to
influence
the
other
witnesses
in
parallel
cases
the
of
the
suggestion
is
always
the
illusion
produced
in
an
individual
by
more
or
less
vague
reminiscences
contagion
following
as
the
result
of
the
affirmation
of
this
initial
illusion
if
the
first
observer
be
very
impressionable
it
will
often
be
sufficient
that
the
corpse
he
believes
he
recognises
should
present
apart
from
all
real
resemblance
some
peculiarity
a
scar
or
some
detail
of
toilet
which
may
evoke
the
idea
of
another
person
the
idea
evoked
may
then
become
the
nucleus
of
a
sort
of
crystallisation
which
invades
the
understanding
and
paralyses
all
critical
faculty
what
the
observer
then
sees
is
no
longer
the
object
itself
but
the
image
evoked
in
his
mind
in
this
way
are
to
be
explained
erroneous
recognitions
of
the
dead
bodies
of
children
by
their
own
mother
as
occurred
in
the
following
case
already
old
but
which
has
been
recently
recalled
by
the
newspapers
in
it
are
to
be
traced
precisely
the
two
kinds
of
suggestion
of
which
i
have
just
pointed
out
the
mechanism
the
child
was
recognised
by
another
child
who
was
mistaken
the
series
of
unwarranted
recognitions
then
began
an
extraordinary
thing
occurred
the
day
after
a
schoolboy
had
recognised
the
corpse
a
woman
exclaimed
heavens
it
is
my
child
she
was
taken
up
to
the
corpse
she
examined
the
clothing
and
noted
a
scar
on
the
forehead
is
certainly
she
said
son
who
disappeared
last
july
he
has
been
stolen
from
me
and
murdered
the
woman
was
concierge
in
the
rue
du
four
her
name
was
chavandret
her
was
summoned
and
when
questioned
he
said
is
the
little
filibert
several
persons
living
in
the
street
recognised
the
child
found
at
la
villette
as
filibert
chavandret
among
them
being
the
boy
schoolmaster
who
based
his
opinion
on
a
medal
worn
by
the
lad
nevertheless
the
neighbours
the
the
schoolmaster
and
the
mother
were
mistaken
six
weeks
later
the
identity
of
the
child
was
established
the
boy
belonging
to
bordeaux
had
been
murdered
there
and
brought
by
a
carrying
company
to
paris
april
it
will
be
remarked
that
these
recognitions
are
most
often
made
by
women
and
children
that
is
to
say
by
precisely
the
most
impressionable
persons
they
show
us
at
the
same
time
what
is
the
worth
in
law
courts
of
such
witnesses
as
far
as
children
more
especially
are
concerned
their
statements
ought
never
to
be
invoked
magistrates
are
in
the
habit
of
repeating
that
children
do
not
lie
did
they
possess
a
psychological
culture
a
little
less
rudimentary
than
is
the
case
they
would
know
that
on
the
contrary
children
invariably
lie
the
lie
is
doubtless
innocent
but
it
is
none
the
less
a
lie
it
would
be
better
to
decide
the
fate
of
an
accused
person
by
the
toss
of
a
coin
than
as
has
been
so
often
done
by
the
evidence
of
a
child
to
return
to
the
faculty
of
observation
possessed
by
crowds
our
conclusion
is
that
their
collective
observations
are
as
erroneous
as
possible
and
that
most
often
they
merely
represent
the
illusion
of
an
individual
who
by
a
process
of
contagion
has
suggestioned
his
fellows
facts
proving
that
the
most
utter
mistrust
of
the
evidence
of
crowds
is
advisable
might
be
multiplied
to
any
extent
thousands
of
men
were
present
years
ago
at
the
celebrated
cavalry
charge
during
the
battle
of
sedan
and
yet
it
is
impossible
in
the
face
of
the
most
contradictory
ocular
testimony
to
decide
by
whom
it
was
commanded
the
english
general
lord
wolseley
has
proved
in
a
recent
book
that
up
to
now
the
gravest
errors
of
fact
have
been
committed
with
regard
to
the
most
important
incidents
of
the
battle
of
waterloo
facts
that
hundreds
of
witnesses
had
nevertheless
attested
do
we
know
in
the
case
of
one
single
battle
exactly
how
it
took
place
i
am
very
doubtful
on
the
point
we
know
who
were
the
conquerors
and
the
conquered
but
this
is
probably
all
what
has
said
with
respect
to
the
battle
of
solferino
which
he
witnessed
and
in
which
he
was
personally
engaged
may
be
applied
to
all
battles
the
generals
informed
of
course
by
the
evidence
of
hundreds
of
witnesses
forward
their
official
reports
the
orderly
officers
modify
these
documents
and
draw
up
a
definite
narrative
the
chief
of
the
staff
raises
objections
and
the
whole
on
a
fresh
basis
it
is
carried
to
the
marshal
who
exclaims
are
entirely
in
error
and
he
substitutes
a
fresh
edition
scarcely
anything
remains
of
the
original
report
relates
this
fact
as
proof
of
the
impossibility
of
establishing
the
truth
in
connection
with
the
most
striking
the
best
observed
events
such
facts
show
us
what
is
the
value
of
the
testimony
of
crowds
treatises
on
logic
include
the
unanimity
of
numerous
witnesses
in
the
category
of
the
strongest
proofs
that
can
be
invoked
in
support
of
the
exactness
of
a
fact
yet
what
we
know
of
the
psychology
of
crowds
shows
that
treatises
on
logic
need
on
this
point
to
be
rewritten
the
events
with
regard
to
which
there
exists
the
most
doubt
are
certainly
those
which
have
been
observed
by
the
greatest
number
of
persons
to
say
that
a
fact
has
been
simultaneously
verified
by
thousands
of
witnesses
is
to
say
as
a
rule
that
the
real
fact
is
very
different
from
the
accepted
account
of
it
it
clearly
results
from
what
precedes
that
works
of
history
must
be
considered
as
works
of
pure
imagination
they
are
fanciful
accounts
of
facts
accompanied
by
explanations
the
result
of
reflection
to
write
such
books
is
the
most
absolute
waste
of
time
had
not
the
past
left
us
its
literary
artistic
and
monumental
works
we
should
know
absolutely
nothing
in
reality
with
regard
to
bygone
times
are
we
in
possession
of
a
single
word
of
truth
concerning
the
lives
of
the
great
men
who
have
played
preponderating
parts
in
the
history
of
humanity
men
such
as
hercules
buddha
or
mahomet
in
all
probability
we
are
not
in
point
of
fact
moreover
their
real
lives
are
of
slight
importance
to
us
our
interest
is
to
know
what
our
great
men
were
as
they
are
presented
by
popular
legend
it
is
legendary
heroes
and
not
for
a
moment
real
heroes
who
have
impressed
the
minds
of
crowds
unfortunately
legends
even
although
they
have
been
definitely
put
on
record
by
books
have
in
themselves
no
stability
the
imagination
of
the
crowd
continually
transforms
them
as
the
result
of
the
lapse
of
time
and
especially
in
consequence
of
racial
causes
there
is
a
great
gulf
fixed
between
the
sanguinary
jehovah
of
the
old
testament
and
the
god
of
love
of
sainte
therese
and
the
buddha
worshipped
in
china
has
no
traits
in
common
with
that
venerated
in
india
it
is
not
even
necessary
that
heroes
should
be
separated
from
us
by
centuries
for
their
legend
to
be
transformed
by
the
imagination
of
the
crowd
the
transformation
occasionally
takes
place
within
a
few
years
in
our
own
day
we
have
seen
the
legend
of
one
of
the
greatest
heroes
of
history
modified
several
times
in
less
than
fifty
years
under
the
bourbons
napoleon
became
a
sort
of
idyllic
and
liberal
philanthropist
a
friend
of
the
humble
who
according
to
the
poets
was
destined
to
be
long
remembered
in
the
cottage
thirty
years
afterwards
this
hero
had
become
a
sanguinary
despot
who
after
having
usurped
power
and
destroyed
liberty
caused
the
slaughter
of
three
million
men
solely
to
satisfy
his
ambition
at
present
we
are
witnessing
a
fresh
transformation
of
the
legend
when
it
has
undergone
the
influence
of
some
dozens
of
centuries
the
learned
men
of
the
future
face
to
face
with
these
contradictory
accounts
will
perhaps
doubt
the
very
existence
of
the
hero
as
some
of
them
now
doubt
that
of
buddha
and
will
see
in
him
nothing
more
than
a
solar
myth
or
a
development
of
the
legend
of
hercules
they
will
doubtless
console
themselves
easily
for
this
uncertainty
for
better
initiated
than
we
are
in
the
characteristics
and
psychology
of
crowds
they
will
know
that
history
is
scarcely
capable
of
preserving
the
memory
of
anything
except
myths
the
exaggeration
and
ingenuousness
of
the
sentiments
of
crowds
whether
the
feelings
exhibited
by
a
crowd
be
good
or
bad
they
present
the
double
character
of
being
very
simple
and
very
exaggerated
on
this
point
as
on
so
many
others
an
individual
in
a
crowd
resembles
primitive
beings
inaccessible
to
fine
distinctions
he
sees
things
as
a
whole
and
is
blind
to
their
intermediate
phases
the
exaggeration
of
the
sentiments
of
a
crowd
is
heightened
by
the
fact
that
any
feeling
when
once
it
is
exhibited
communicating
itself
very
quickly
by
a
process
of
suggestion
and
contagion
the
evident
approbation
of
which
it
is
the
object
considerably
increases
its
force
the
simplicity
and
exaggeration
of
the
sentiments
of
crowds
have
for
result
that
a
throng
knows
neither
doubt
nor
uncertainty
like
women
it
goes
at
once
to
extremes
a
suspicion
transforms
itself
as
soon
as
announced
into
incontrovertible
evidence
a
commencement
of
antipathy
or
disapprobation
which
in
the
case
of
an
isolated
individual
would
not
gain
strength
becomes
at
once
furious
hatred
in
the
case
of
an
individual
in
a
crowd
the
violence
of
the
feelings
of
crowds
is
also
increased
especially
in
heterogeneous
crowds
by
the
absence
of
all
sense
of
responsibility
the
certainty
of
impunity
a
certainty
the
stronger
as
the
crowd
is
more
numerous
and
the
notion
of
a
considerable
momentary
force
due
to
number
make
possible
in
the
case
of
crowds
sentiments
and
acts
impossible
for
the
isolated
individual
in
crowds
the
foolish
ignorant
and
envious
persons
are
freed
from
the
sense
of
their
insignificance
and
powerlessness
and
are
possessed
instead
by
the
notion
of
brutal
and
temporary
but
immense
strength
unfortunately
this
tendency
of
crowds
towards
exaggeration
is
often
brought
to
bear
upon
bad
sentiments
these
sentiments
are
atavistic
residuum
of
the
instincts
of
the
primitive
man
which
the
fear
of
punishment
obliges
the
isolated
and
responsible
individual
to
curb
thus
it
is
that
crowds
are
so
easily
led
into
the
worst
excesses
still
this
does
not
mean
that
crowds
skilfully
influenced
are
not
capable
of
heroism
and
devotion
and
of
evincing
the
loftiest
virtues
they
are
even
more
capable
of
showing
these
qualities
than
the
isolated
individual
we
shall
soon
have
occasion
to
revert
to
this
point
when
we
come
to
study
the
morality
of
crowds
given
to
exaggeration
in
its
feelings
a
crowd
is
only
impressed
by
excessive
sentiments
an
orator
wishing
to
move
a
crowd
must
make
an
abusive
use
of
violent
affirmations
to
exaggerate
to
affirm
to
resort
to
repetitions
and
never
to
attempt
to
prove
anything
by
reasoning
are
methods
of
argument
well
known
to
speakers
at
public
meetings
moreover
a
crowd
exacts
a
like
exaggeration
in
the
sentiments
of
its
heroes
their
apparent
qualities
and
virtues
must
always
be
amplified
it
has
been
justly
remarked
that
on
the
stage
a
crowd
demands
from
the
hero
of
the
piece
a
degree
of
courage
morality
and
virtue
that
is
never
to
be
found
in
real
life
quite
rightly
importance
has
been
laid
on
the
special
standpoint
from
which
matters
are
viewed
in
the
theatre
such
a
standpoint
exists
no
doubt
but
its
rules
for
the
most
part
have
nothing
to
do
with
common
sense
and
logic
the
art
of
appealing
to
crowds
is
no
doubt
of
an
inferior
order
but
it
demands
quite
special
aptitudes
it
is
often
impossible
on
reading
plays
to
explain
their
success
managers
of
theatres
when
accepting
pieces
are
themselves
as
a
rule
very
uncertain
of
their
success
because
to
judge
the
matter
it
would
be
necessary
that
they
should
be
able
to
transform
themselves
into
a
crowd
it
is
understandable
for
this
reason
why
it
sometimes
happens
that
pieces
refused
by
all
theatrical
managers
obtain
a
prodigious
success
when
by
a
stroke
of
chance
they
are
put
on
the
stage
the
recent
success
of
francois
coppee
play
pour
la
couronne
is
well
known
and
yet
in
spite
of
the
name
of
its
author
it
was
refused
during
ten
years
by
the
managers
of
the
principal
parisian
theatres
charley
aunt
refused
at
every
theatre
and
finally
staged
at
the
expense
of
a
stockbroker
has
had
two
hundred
representations
in
france
and
more
than
a
thousand
in
london
without
the
explanation
given
above
of
the
impossibility
for
theatrical
managers
to
mentally
substitute
themselves
for
a
crowd
such
mistakes
in
judgment
on
the
part
of
competent
individuals
who
are
most
interested
not
to
commit
such
grave
blunders
would
be
inexplicable
this
is
a
subject
that
i
can
not
deal
with
here
but
it
might
worthily
tempt
the
pen
of
a
writer
acquainted
with
theatrical
matters
and
at
the
same
time
a
subtle
psychologist
of
such
a
writer
for
instance
as
francisque
sarcey
here
once
more
were
we
able
to
embark
on
more
extensive
explanations
we
should
show
the
preponderating
influence
of
racial
considerations
a
play
which
provokes
the
enthusiasm
of
the
crowd
in
one
country
has
sometimes
no
success
in
another
or
has
only
a
partial
and
conventional
success
because
it
does
not
put
in
operation
influences
capable
of
working
on
an
altered
public
i
need
not
add
that
the
tendency
to
exaggeration
in
crowds
is
only
present
in
the
case
of
sentiments
and
not
at
all
in
the
matter
of
intelligence
i
have
already
shown
that
by
the
mere
fact
that
an
individual
forms
part
of
a
crowd
his
intellectual
standard
is
immediately
and
considerably
lowered
a
learned
magistrate
tarde
has
also
verified
this
fact
in
his
researches
on
the
crimes
of
crowds
it
is
only
then
with
respect
to
sentiment
that
crowds
can
rise
to
a
very
high
or
on
the
contrary
descend
to
a
very
low
level
the
intolerance
dictatorialness
and
conservatism
of
crowds
crowds
are
only
cognisant
of
simple
and
extreme
sentiments
the
opinions
ideas
and
beliefs
suggested
to
them
are
accepted
or
rejected
as
a
whole
and
considered
as
absolute
truths
or
as
not
less
absolute
errors
this
is
always
the
case
with
beliefs
induced
by
a
process
of
suggestion
instead
of
engendered
by
reasoning
every
one
is
aware
of
the
intolerance
that
accompanies
religious
beliefs
and
of
the
despotic
empire
they
exercise
on
men
minds
being
in
doubt
as
to
what
constitutes
truth
or
error
and
having
on
the
other
hand
a
clear
notion
of
its
strength
a
crowd
is
as
disposed
to
give
authoritative
effect
to
its
inspirations
as
it
is
intolerant
an
individual
may
accept
contradiction
and
discussion
a
crowd
will
never
do
so
at
public
meetings
the
slightest
contradiction
on
the
part
of
an
orator
is
immediately
received
with
howls
of
fury
and
violent
invective
soon
followed
by
blows
and
expulsion
should
the
orator
stick
to
his
point
without
the
restraining
presence
of
the
representatives
of
authority
the
contradictor
indeed
would
often
be
done
to
death
dictatorialness
and
intolerance
are
common
to
all
categories
of
crowds
but
they
are
met
with
in
a
varying
degree
of
intensity
here
once
more
reappears
that
fundamental
notion
of
race
which
dominates
all
the
feelings
and
all
the
thoughts
of
men
it
is
more
especially
in
latin
crowds
that
authoritativeness
and
intolerance
are
found
developed
in
the
highest
measure
in
fact
their
development
is
such
in
crowds
of
latin
origin
that
they
have
entirely
destroyed
that
sentiment
of
the
independence
of
the
individual
so
powerful
in
the
latin
crowds
are
only
concerned
with
the
collective
independence
of
the
sect
to
which
they
belong
and
the
characteristic
feature
of
their
conception
of
independence
is
the
need
they
experience
of
bringing
those
who
are
in
disagreement
with
themselves
into
immediate
and
violent
subjection
to
their
beliefs
among
the
latin
races
the
jacobins
of
every
epoch
from
those
of
the
inquisition
downwards
have
never
been
able
to
attain
to
a
different
conception
of
liberty
authoritativeness
and
intolerance
are
sentiments
of
which
crowds
have
a
very
clear
notion
which
they
easily
conceive
and
which
they
entertain
as
readily
as
they
put
them
in
practice
when
once
they
are
imposed
upon
them
crowds
exhibit
a
docile
respect
for
force
and
are
but
slightly
impressed
by
kindness
which
for
them
is
scarcely
other
than
a
form
of
weakness
their
sympathies
have
never
been
bestowed
on
masters
but
on
tyrants
who
vigorously
oppressed
them
it
is
to
these
latter
that
they
always
erect
the
loftiest
statues
it
is
true
that
they
willingly
trample
on
the
despot
whom
they
have
stripped
of
his
power
but
it
is
because
having
lost
his
strength
he
has
resumed
his
place
among
the
feeble
who
are
to
be
despised
because
they
are
not
to
be
feared
the
type
of
hero
dear
to
crowds
will
always
have
the
semblance
of
a
caesar
his
insignia
attracts
them
his
authority
overawes
them
and
his
sword
instils
them
with
fear
a
crowd
is
always
ready
to
revolt
against
a
feeble
and
to
bow
down
servilely
before
a
strong
authority
should
the
strength
of
an
authority
be
intermittent
the
crowd
always
obedient
to
its
extreme
sentiments
passes
alternately
from
anarchy
to
servitude
and
from
servitude
to
anarchy
however
to
believe
in
the
predominance
among
crowds
of
revolutionary
instincts
would
be
to
entirely
misconstrue
their
psychology
it
is
merely
their
tendency
to
violence
that
deceives
us
on
this
point
their
rebellious
and
destructive
outbursts
are
always
very
transitory
crowds
are
too
much
governed
by
unconscious
considerations
and
too
much
subject
in
consequence
to
secular
hereditary
influences
not
to
be
extremely
conservative
abandoned
to
themselves
they
soon
weary
of
disorder
and
instinctively
turn
to
servitude
it
was
the
proudest
and
most
untractable
of
the
jacobins
who
acclaimed
bonaparte
with
greatest
energy
when
he
suppressed
all
liberty
and
made
his
hand
of
iron
severely
felt
it
is
difficult
to
understand
history
and
popular
revolutions
in
particular
if
one
does
not
take
sufficiently
into
account
the
profoundly
conservative
instincts
of
crowds
they
may
be
desirous
it
is
true
of
changing
the
names
of
their
institutions
and
to
obtain
these
changes
they
accomplish
at
times
even
violent
revolutions
but
the
essence
of
these
institutions
is
too
much
the
expression
of
the
hereditary
needs
of
the
race
for
them
not
invariably
to
abide
by
it
their
incessant
mobility
only
exerts
its
influence
on
quite
superficial
matters
in
fact
they
possess
conservative
instincts
as
indestructible
as
those
of
all
primitive
beings
their
like
respect
for
all
traditions
is
absolute
their
unconscious
horror
of
all
novelty
capable
of
changing
the
essential
conditions
of
their
existence
is
very
deeply
rooted
had
democracies
possessed
the
power
they
wield
at
the
time
of
the
invention
of
mechanical
looms
or
of
the
introduction
of
and
of
railways
the
realisation
of
these
inventions
would
have
been
impossible
or
would
have
been
achieved
at
the
cost
of
revolutions
and
repeated
massacres
it
is
fortunate
for
the
progress
of
civilisation
that
the
power
of
crowds
only
began
to
exist
when
the
great
discoveries
of
science
and
industry
had
already
been
effected
the
morality
of
crowds
taking
the
word
morality
to
mean
constant
respect
for
certain
social
conventions
and
the
permanent
repression
of
selfish
impulses
it
is
quite
evident
that
crowds
are
too
impulsive
and
too
mobile
to
be
moral
if
however
we
include
in
the
term
morality
the
transitory
display
of
certain
qualities
such
as
abnegation
disinterestedness
devotion
and
the
need
of
equity
we
may
say
on
the
contrary
that
crowds
may
exhibit
at
times
a
very
lofty
morality
the
few
psychologists
who
have
studied
crowds
have
only
considered
them
from
the
point
of
view
of
their
criminal
acts
and
noticing
how
frequent
these
acts
are
they
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
moral
standard
of
crowds
is
very
low
doubtless
this
is
often
the
case
but
why
simply
because
our
savage
destructive
instincts
are
the
inheritance
left
dormant
in
all
of
us
from
the
primitive
ages
in
the
life
of
the
isolated
individual
it
would
be
dangerous
for
him
to
gratify
these
instincts
while
his
absorption
in
an
irresponsible
crowd
in
which
in
consequence
he
is
assured
of
impunity
gives
him
entire
liberty
to
follow
them
being
unable
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
to
exercise
these
destructive
instincts
on
our
men
we
confine
ourselves
to
exercising
them
on
animals
the
passion
so
widespread
for
the
chase
and
the
acts
of
ferocity
of
crowds
proceed
from
one
and
the
same
source
a
crowd
which
slowly
slaughters
a
defenceless
victim
displays
a
very
cowardly
ferocity
but
for
the
philosopher
this
ferocity
is
very
closely
related
to
that
of
the
huntsmen
who
gather
in
dozens
for
the
pleasure
of
taking
part
in
the
pursuit
and
killing
of
a
luckless
stag
by
their
hounds
a
crowd
may
be
guilty
of
murder
incendiarism
and
every
kind
of
crime
but
it
is
also
capable
of
very
lofty
acts
of
devotion
sacrifice
and
disinterestedness
of
acts
much
loftier
indeed
than
those
of
which
the
isolated
individual
is
capable
appeals
to
sentiments
of
glory
honour
and
patriotism
are
particularly
likely
to
influence
the
individual
forming
part
of
a
crowd
and
often
to
the
extent
of
obtaining
from
him
the
sacrifice
of
his
life
history
is
rich
in
examples
analogous
to
those
furnished
by
the
crusaders
and
the
volunteers
of
collectivities
alone
are
capable
of
great
disinterestedness
and
great
devotion
how
numerous
are
the
crowds
that
have
heroically
faced
death
for
beliefs
ideas
and
phrases
that
they
scarcely
understood
the
crowds
that
go
on
strike
do
so
far
more
in
obedience
to
an
order
than
to
obtain
an
increase
of
the
slender
salary
with
which
they
make
shift
personal
interest
is
very
rarely
a
powerful
motive
force
with
crowds
while
it
is
almost
the
exclusive
motive
of
the
conduct
of
the
isolated
individual
it
is
assuredly
not
that
has
guided
crowds
in
so
many
wars
incomprehensible
as
a
rule
to
their
intelligence
wars
in
which
they
have
allowed
themselves
to
be
massacred
as
easily
as
the
larks
hypnotised
by
the
mirror
of
the
hunter
even
in
the
case
of
absolute
scoundrels
it
often
happens
that
the
mere
fact
of
their
being
in
a
crowd
endows
them
for
the
moment
with
very
strict
principles
of
morality
taine
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
perpetrators
of
the
september
massacres
deposited
on
the
table
of
the
committees
the
and
jewels
they
had
found
on
their
victims
and
with
which
they
could
easily
have
been
able
to
make
away
the
howling
swarming
ragged
crowd
which
invaded
the
tuileries
during
the
revolution
of
did
not
lay
hands
on
any
of
the
objects
that
excited
its
astonishment
and
one
of
which
would
have
meant
bread
for
many
days
this
moralisation
of
the
individual
by
the
crowd
is
not
certainly
a
constant
rule
but
it
is
a
rule
frequently
observed
it
is
even
observed
in
circumstances
much
less
grave
than
those
i
have
just
cited
i
have
remarked
that
in
the
theatre
a
crowd
exacts
from
the
hero
of
the
piece
exaggerated
virtues
and
it
is
a
commonplace
observation
that
an
assembly
even
though
composed
of
inferior
elements
shows
itself
as
a
rule
very
prudish
the
debauchee
the
souteneur
the
rough
often
break
out
into
murmurs
at
a
slightly
risky
scene
or
expression
though
they
be
very
harmless
in
comparison
with
their
customary
conversation
if
then
crowds
often
abandon
themselves
to
low
instincts
they
also
set
the
example
at
times
of
acts
of
lofty
morality
if
disinterestedness
resignation
and
absolute
devotion
to
a
real
or
chimerical
ideal
are
moral
virtues
it
may
be
said
that
crowds
often
possess
these
virtues
to
a
degree
rarely
attained
by
the
wisest
philosophers
doubtless
they
practice
them
unconsciously
but
that
is
of
small
import
we
should
not
complain
too
much
that
crowds
are
more
especially
guided
by
unconscious
considerations
and
are
not
given
to
reasoning
had
they
in
certain
cases
reasoned
and
consulted
their
immediate
interests
it
is
possible
that
no
civilisation
would
have
grown
up
on
our
planet
and
humanity
would
have
had
no
history

the
ideas
reasoning
power
and
imagination
of
crowds
the
ideas
of
crowds
fundamental
and
accessory
ideas
how
contradictory
ideas
may
exist
simultaneously
the
transformation
that
must
be
undergone
by
lofty
ideas
before
they
are
accessible
to
crowds
the
social
influence
of
ideas
is
independent
of
the
degree
of
truth
they
may
contain
the
reasoning
power
of
crowds
crowds
are
not
to
be
influenced
by
reasoning
the
reasoning
of
crowds
is
always
of
a
very
inferior
order
there
is
only
the
appearance
of
analogy
or
succession
in
the
ideas
they
associate
the
imagination
of
crowds
strength
of
the
imagination
of
crowds
crowds
think
in
images
and
these
images
succeed
each
other
without
any
connecting
link
crowds
are
especially
impressed
by
the
marvellous
legends
and
the
marvellous
are
the
real
pillars
of
civilisation
the
popular
imagination
has
always
been
the
basis
of
the
power
of
statesmen
the
manner
in
which
facts
capable
of
striking
the
imagination
of
crowds
present
themselves
for
observation
the
ideas
of
crowds
when
studying
in
a
preceding
work
the
part
played
by
ideas
in
the
evolution
of
nations
we
showed
that
every
civilisation
is
the
outcome
of
a
small
number
of
fundamental
ideas
that
are
very
rarely
renewed
we
showed
how
these
ideas
are
implanted
in
the
minds
of
crowds
with
what
difficulty
the
process
is
effected
and
the
power
possessed
by
the
ideas
in
question
when
once
it
has
been
accomplished
finally
we
saw
that
great
historical
perturbations
are
the
result
as
a
rule
of
changes
in
these
fundamental
ideas
having
treated
this
subject
at
sufficient
length
i
shall
not
return
to
it
now
but
shall
confine
myself
to
saying
a
few
words
on
the
subject
of
such
ideas
as
are
accessible
to
crowds
and
of
the
forms
under
which
they
conceive
them
they
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
in
one
we
shall
place
accidental
and
passing
ideas
created
by
the
influences
of
the
moment
infatuation
for
an
individual
or
a
doctrine
for
instance
in
the
other
will
be
classed
the
fundamental
ideas
to
which
the
environment
the
laws
of
heredity
and
public
opinion
give
a
very
great
stability
such
ideas
are
the
religious
beliefs
of
the
past
and
the
social
and
democratic
ideas
of
these
fundamental
ideas
resemble
the
volume
of
the
water
of
a
stream
slowly
pursuing
its
course
the
transitory
ideas
are
like
the
small
waves
for
ever
changing
which
agitate
its
surface
and
are
more
visible
than
the
progress
of
the
stream
itself
although
without
real
importance
at
the
present
day
the
great
fundamental
ideas
which
were
the
mainstay
of
our
fathers
are
tottering
more
and
more
they
have
lost
all
solidity
and
at
the
same
time
the
institutions
resting
upon
them
are
severely
shaken
every
day
there
are
formed
a
great
many
of
those
transitory
minor
ideas
of
which
i
have
just
been
speaking
but
very
few
of
them
to
all
appearance
seem
endowed
with
vitality
and
destined
to
acquire
a
preponderating
influence
whatever
be
the
ideas
suggested
to
crowds
they
can
only
exercise
effective
influence
on
condition
that
they
assume
a
very
absolute
uncompromising
and
simple
shape
they
present
themselves
then
in
the
guise
of
images
and
are
only
accessible
to
the
masses
under
this
form
these
imagelike
ideas
are
not
connected
by
any
logical
bond
of
analogy
or
succession
and
may
take
each
other
place
like
the
slides
of
a
which
the
operator
withdraws
from
the
groove
in
which
they
were
placed
one
above
the
other
this
explains
how
it
is
that
the
most
contradictory
ideas
may
be
seen
to
be
simultaneously
current
in
crowds
according
to
the
chances
of
the
moment
a
crowd
will
come
under
the
influence
of
one
of
the
various
ideas
stored
up
in
its
understanding
and
is
capable
in
consequence
of
committing
the
most
dissimilar
acts
its
complete
lack
of
the
critical
spirit
does
not
allow
of
its
perceiving
these
contradictions
this
phenomenon
is
not
peculiar
to
crowds
it
is
to
be
observed
in
many
isolated
individuals
not
only
among
primitive
beings
but
in
the
case
of
all
those
the
fervent
sectaries
of
a
religious
faith
for
instance
who
by
one
side
or
another
of
their
intelligence
are
akin
to
primitive
beings
i
have
observed
its
presence
to
a
curious
extent
in
the
case
of
educated
hindoos
brought
up
at
our
european
universities
and
having
taken
their
degree
a
number
of
western
ideas
had
been
superposed
on
their
unchangeable
and
fundamental
hereditary
or
social
ideas
according
to
the
chances
of
the
moment
the
one
or
the
other
set
of
ideas
showed
themselves
each
with
their
special
accompaniment
of
acts
or
utterances
the
same
individual
presenting
in
this
way
the
most
flagrant
contradictions
these
contradictions
are
more
apparent
than
real
for
it
is
only
hereditary
ideas
that
have
sufficient
influence
over
the
isolated
individual
to
become
motives
of
conduct
it
is
only
when
as
the
result
of
the
intermingling
of
different
races
a
man
is
placed
between
different
hereditary
tendencies
that
his
acts
from
one
moment
to
another
may
be
really
entirely
contradictory
it
would
be
useless
to
insist
here
on
these
phenomena
although
their
psychological
importance
is
capital
i
am
of
opinion
that
at
least
ten
years
of
travel
and
observation
would
be
necessary
to
arrive
at
a
comprehension
of
them
ideas
being
only
accessible
to
crowds
after
having
assumed
a
very
simple
shape
must
often
undergo
the
most
thoroughgoing
transformations
to
become
popular
it
is
especially
when
we
are
dealing
with
somewhat
lofty
philosophic
or
scientific
ideas
that
we
see
how
are
the
modifications
they
require
in
order
to
lower
them
to
the
level
of
the
intelligence
of
crowds
these
modifications
are
dependent
on
the
nature
of
the
crowds
or
of
the
race
to
which
the
crowds
belong
but
their
tendency
is
always
belittling
and
in
the
direction
of
simplification
this
explains
the
fact
that
from
the
social
point
of
view
there
is
in
reality
scarcely
any
such
thing
as
a
hierarchy
of
ideas
that
is
to
say
as
ideas
of
greater
or
less
elevation
however
great
or
true
an
idea
may
have
been
to
begin
with
it
is
deprived
of
almost
all
that
which
constituted
its
elevation
and
its
greatness
by
the
mere
fact
that
it
has
come
within
the
intellectual
range
of
crowds
and
exerts
an
influence
upon
them
moreover
from
the
social
point
of
view
the
hierarchical
value
of
an
idea
its
intrinsic
worth
is
without
importance
the
necessary
point
to
consider
is
the
effects
it
produces
the
christian
ideas
of
the
middle
ages
the
democratic
ideas
of
the
last
century
or
the
social
ideas
of
are
assuredly
not
very
elevated
philosophically
considered
they
can
only
be
regarded
as
somewhat
sorry
errors
and
yet
their
power
has
been
and
will
be
immense
and
they
will
count
for
a
long
time
to
come
among
the
most
essential
factors
that
determine
the
conduct
of
states
even
when
an
idea
has
undergone
the
transformations
which
render
it
accessible
to
crowds
it
only
exerts
influence
when
by
various
processes
which
we
shall
examine
elsewhere
it
has
entered
the
domain
of
the
unconscious
when
indeed
it
has
become
a
sentiment
for
which
much
time
is
required
for
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
merely
because
the
justness
of
an
idea
has
been
proved
it
can
be
productive
of
effective
action
even
on
cultivated
minds
this
fact
may
be
quickly
appreciated
by
noting
how
slight
is
the
influence
of
the
clearest
demonstration
on
the
majority
of
men
evidence
if
it
be
very
plain
may
be
accepted
by
an
educated
person
but
the
convert
will
be
quickly
brought
back
by
his
unconscious
self
to
his
original
conceptions
see
him
again
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
days
and
he
will
put
forward
afresh
his
old
arguments
in
exactly
the
same
terms
he
is
in
reality
under
the
influence
of
anterior
ideas
that
have
become
sentiments
and
it
is
such
ideas
alone
that
influence
the
more
recondite
motives
of
our
acts
and
utterances
it
can
not
be
otherwise
in
the
case
of
crowds
when
by
various
processes
an
idea
has
ended
by
penetrating
into
the
minds
of
crowds
it
possesses
an
irresistible
power
and
brings
about
a
series
of
effects
opposition
to
which
is
bootless
the
philosophical
ideas
which
resulted
in
the
french
revolution
took
nearly
a
century
to
implant
themselves
in
the
mind
of
the
crowd
their
irresistible
force
when
once
they
had
taken
root
is
known
the
striving
of
an
entire
nation
towards
the
conquest
of
social
equality
and
the
realisation
of
abstract
rights
and
ideal
liberties
caused
the
tottering
of
all
thrones
and
profoundly
disturbed
the
western
world
during
twenty
years
the
nations
were
engaged
in
internecine
conflict
and
europe
witnessed
hecatombs
that
would
have
terrified
ghengis
khan
and
tamerlane
the
world
had
never
seen
on
such
a
scale
what
may
result
from
the
promulgation
of
an
idea
a
long
time
is
necessary
for
ideas
to
establish
themselves
in
the
minds
of
crowds
but
just
as
long
a
time
is
needed
for
them
to
be
eradicated
for
this
reason
crowds
as
far
as
ideas
are
concerned
are
always
several
generations
behind
learned
men
and
philosophers
all
statesmen
are
well
aware
of
the
admixture
of
error
contained
in
the
fundamental
ideas
i
referred
to
a
short
while
back
but
as
the
influence
of
these
ideas
is
still
very
powerful
they
are
obliged
to
govern
in
accordance
with
principles
in
the
truth
of
which
they
have
ceased
to
believe
the
reasoning
power
of
crowds
it
can
not
absolutely
be
said
that
crowds
do
not
reason
and
are
not
to
be
influenced
by
reasoning
however
the
arguments
they
employ
and
those
which
are
capable
of
influencing
them
are
from
a
logical
point
of
view
of
such
an
inferior
kind
that
it
is
only
by
way
of
analogy
that
they
can
be
described
as
reasoning
the
inferior
reasoning
of
crowds
is
based
just
as
is
reasoning
of
a
high
order
on
the
association
of
ideas
but
between
the
ideas
associated
by
crowds
there
are
only
apparent
bonds
of
analogy
or
succession
the
mode
of
reasoning
of
crowds
resembles
that
of
the
esquimaux
who
knowing
from
experience
that
ice
a
transparent
body
melts
in
the
mouth
concludes
that
glass
also
a
transparent
body
should
also
melt
in
the
mouth
or
that
of
the
savage
who
imagines
that
by
eating
the
heart
of
a
courageous
foe
he
acquires
his
bravery
or
of
the
workman
who
having
been
exploited
by
one
employer
of
labour
immediately
concludes
that
all
employers
exploit
their
men
the
characteristics
of
the
reasoning
of
crowds
are
the
association
of
dissimilar
things
possessing
a
merely
apparent
connection
between
each
other
and
the
immediate
generalisation
of
particular
cases
it
is
arguments
of
this
kind
that
are
always
presented
to
crowds
by
those
who
know
how
to
manage
them
they
are
the
only
arguments
by
which
crowds
are
to
be
influenced
a
chain
of
logical
argumentation
is
totally
incomprehensible
to
crowds
and
for
this
reason
it
is
permissible
to
say
that
they
do
not
reason
or
that
they
reason
falsely
and
are
not
to
be
influenced
by
reasoning
astonishment
is
felt
at
times
on
reading
certain
speeches
at
their
weakness
and
yet
they
had
an
enormous
influence
on
the
crowds
which
listened
to
them
but
it
is
forgotten
that
they
were
intended
to
persuade
collectivities
and
not
to
be
read
by
philosophers
an
orator
in
intimate
communication
with
a
crowd
can
evoke
images
by
which
it
will
be
seduced
if
he
is
successful
his
object
has
been
attained
and
twenty
volumes
of
harangues
always
the
outcome
of
reflection
are
not
worth
the
few
phrases
which
appealed
to
the
brains
it
was
required
to
convince
it
would
be
superfluous
to
add
that
the
powerlessness
of
crowds
to
reason
aright
prevents
them
displaying
any
trace
of
the
critical
spirit
prevents
them
that
is
from
being
capable
of
discerning
truth
from
error
or
of
forming
a
precise
judgment
on
any
matter
judgments
accepted
by
crowds
are
merely
judgments
forced
upon
them
and
never
judgments
adopted
after
discussion
in
regard
to
this
matter
the
individuals
who
do
not
rise
above
the
level
of
a
crowd
are
numerous
the
ease
with
which
certain
opinions
obtain
general
acceptance
results
more
especially
from
the
impossibility
experienced
by
the
majority
of
men
of
forming
an
opinion
peculiar
to
themselves
and
based
on
reasoning
of
their
own
the
imagination
of
crowds
just
as
is
the
case
with
respect
to
persons
in
whom
the
reasoning
power
is
absent
the
figurative
imagination
of
crowds
is
very
powerful
very
active
and
very
susceptible
of
being
keenly
impressed
the
images
evoked
in
their
mind
by
a
personage
an
event
an
accident
are
almost
as
lifelike
as
the
reality
crowds
are
to
some
extent
in
the
position
of
the
sleeper
whose
reason
suspended
for
the
time
being
allows
the
arousing
in
his
mind
of
images
of
extreme
intensity
which
would
quickly
be
dissipated
could
they
be
submitted
to
the
action
of
reflection
crowds
being
incapable
both
of
reflection
and
of
reasoning
are
devoid
of
the
notion
of
improbability
and
it
is
to
be
noted
that
in
a
general
way
it
is
the
most
improbable
things
that
are
the
most
striking
this
is
why
it
happens
that
it
is
always
the
marvellous
and
legendary
side
of
events
that
more
specially
strike
crowds
when
a
civilisation
is
analysed
it
is
seen
that
in
reality
it
is
the
marvellous
and
the
legendary
that
are
its
true
supports
appearances
have
always
played
a
much
more
important
part
than
reality
in
history
where
the
unreal
is
always
of
greater
moment
than
the
real
crowds
being
only
capable
of
thinking
in
images
are
only
to
be
impressed
by
images
it
is
only
images
that
terrify
or
attract
them
and
become
motives
of
action
for
this
reason
theatrical
representations
in
which
the
image
is
shown
in
its
most
clearly
visible
shape
always
have
an
enormous
influence
on
crowds
bread
and
spectacular
shows
constituted
for
the
plebeians
of
ancient
rome
the
ideal
of
happiness
and
they
asked
for
nothing
more
throughout
the
successive
ages
this
ideal
has
scarcely
varied
nothing
has
a
greater
effect
on
the
imagination
of
crowds
of
every
category
than
theatrical
representations
the
entire
audience
experiences
at
the
same
time
the
same
emotions
and
if
these
emotions
are
not
at
once
transformed
into
acts
it
is
because
the
most
unconscious
spectator
can
not
ignore
that
he
is
the
victim
of
illusions
and
that
he
has
laughed
or
wept
over
imaginary
adventures
sometimes
however
the
sentiments
suggested
by
the
images
are
so
strong
that
they
tend
like
habitual
suggestions
to
transform
themselves
into
acts
the
story
has
often
been
told
of
the
manager
of
a
popular
theatre
who
in
consequence
of
his
only
playing
sombre
dramas
was
obliged
to
have
the
actor
who
took
the
part
of
the
traitor
protected
on
his
leaving
the
theatre
to
defend
him
against
the
violence
of
the
spectators
indignant
at
the
crimes
imaginary
though
they
were
which
the
traitor
had
committed
we
have
here
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
most
remarkable
indications
of
the
mental
state
of
crowds
and
especially
of
the
facility
with
which
they
are
suggestioned
the
unreal
has
almost
as
much
influence
on
them
as
the
real
they
have
an
evident
tendency
not
to
distinguish
between
the
two
the
power
of
conquerors
and
the
strength
of
states
is
based
on
the
popular
imagination
it
is
more
particularly
by
working
upon
this
imagination
that
crowds
are
led
all
great
historical
facts
the
rise
of
buddhism
of
christianity
of
islamism
the
reformation
the
french
revolution
and
in
our
own
time
the
threatening
invasion
of
socialism
are
the
direct
or
indirect
consequences
of
strong
impressions
produced
on
the
imagination
of
the
crowd
moreover
all
the
great
statesmen
of
every
age
and
every
country
including
the
most
absolute
despots
have
regarded
the
popular
imagination
as
the
basis
of
their
power
and
they
have
never
attempted
to
govern
in
opposition
to
it
it
was
by
becoming
a
catholic
said
napoleon
to
the
council
of
state
that
i
terminated
the
vendeen
war
by
becoming
a
mussulman
that
i
obtained
a
footing
in
egypt
by
becoming
an
ultramontane
that
i
won
over
the
italian
priests
and
had
i
to
govern
a
nation
of
jews
i
would
rebuild
solomon
temple
never
perhaps
since
alexander
and
caesar
has
any
great
man
better
understood
how
the
imagination
of
the
crowd
should
be
impressed
his
constant
preoccupation
was
to
strike
it
he
bore
it
in
mind
in
his
victories
in
his
harangues
in
his
speeches
in
all
his
acts
on
his
deathbed
it
was
still
in
his
thoughts
how
is
the
imagination
of
crowds
to
be
impressed
we
shall
soon
see
let
us
confine
ourselves
for
the
moment
to
saying
that
the
feat
is
never
to
be
achieved
by
attempting
to
work
upon
the
intelligence
or
reasoning
faculty
that
is
to
say
by
way
of
demonstration
it
was
not
by
means
of
cunning
rhetoric
that
antony
succeeded
in
making
the
populace
rise
against
the
murderers
of
caesar
it
was
by
reading
his
will
to
the
multitude
and
pointing
to
his
corpse
whatever
strikes
the
imagination
of
crowds
presents
itself
under
the
shape
of
a
startling
and
very
clear
image
freed
from
all
accessory
explanation
or
merely
having
as
accompaniment
a
few
marvellous
or
mysterious
facts
examples
in
point
are
a
great
victory
a
great
miracle
a
great
crime
or
a
great
hope
things
must
be
laid
before
the
crowd
as
a
whole
and
their
genesis
must
never
be
indicated
a
hundred
petty
crimes
or
petty
accidents
will
not
strike
the
imagination
of
crowds
in
the
least
whereas
a
single
great
crime
or
a
single
great
accident
will
profoundly
impress
them
even
though
the
results
be
infinitely
less
disastrous
than
those
of
the
hundred
small
accidents
put
together
the
epidemic
of
influenza
which
caused
the
death
but
a
few
years
ago
of
five
thousand
persons
in
paris
alone
made
very
little
impression
on
the
popular
imagination
the
reason
was
that
this
veritable
hecatomb
was
not
embodied
in
any
visible
image
but
was
only
learnt
from
statistical
information
furnished
weekly
an
accident
which
should
have
caused
the
death
of
only
five
hundred
instead
of
five
thousand
persons
but
on
the
same
day
and
in
public
as
the
outcome
of
an
accident
appealing
strongly
to
the
eye
by
the
fall
for
instance
of
the
eiffel
tower
would
have
produced
on
the
contrary
an
immense
impression
on
the
imagination
of
the
crowd
the
probable
loss
of
a
transatlantic
steamer
that
was
supposed
in
the
absence
of
news
to
have
gone
down
in
profoundly
impressed
the
imagination
of
the
crowd
for
a
whole
week
yet
official
statistics
show
that
sailing
vessels
and
steamers
were
lost
in
the
year
alone
the
crowd
however
was
never
for
a
moment
concerned
by
these
successive
losses
much
more
important
though
they
were
as
far
as
regards
the
destruction
of
life
and
property
than
the
loss
of
the
atlantic
liner
in
question
could
possibly
have
been
it
is
not
then
the
facts
in
themselves
that
strike
the
popular
imagination
but
the
way
in
which
they
take
place
and
are
brought
under
notice
it
is
necessary
that
by
their
condensation
if
i
may
thus
express
myself
they
should
produce
a
startling
image
which
fills
and
besets
the
mind
to
know
the
art
of
impressing
the
imagination
of
crowds
is
to
know
at
the
same
time
the
art
of
governing
them
chapter
iv
a
religious
shape
assumed
by
all
the
convictions
of
crowds
what
is
meant
by
the
religious
sentiment
it
is
independent
of
the
worship
of
a
divinity
its
characteristics
the
strength
of
convictions
assuming
a
religious
shape
various
examples
popular
gods
have
never
disappeared
new
forms
under
which
they
are
revived
religious
forms
of
atheism
importance
of
these
notions
from
the
historical
point
of
view
the
reformation
saint
bartholomew
the
terror
and
all
analogous
events
are
the
result
of
the
religious
sentiments
of
crowds
and
not
of
the
will
of
isolated
individuals
we
have
shown
that
crowds
do
not
reason
that
they
accept
or
reject
ideas
as
a
whole
that
they
tolerate
neither
discussion
nor
contradiction
and
that
the
suggestions
brought
to
bear
on
them
invade
the
entire
field
of
their
understanding
and
tend
at
once
to
transform
themselves
into
acts
we
have
shown
that
crowds
suitably
influenced
are
ready
to
sacrifice
themselves
for
the
ideal
with
which
they
have
been
inspired
we
have
also
seen
that
they
only
entertain
violent
and
extreme
sentiments
that
in
their
case
sympathy
quickly
becomes
adoration
and
antipathy
almost
as
soon
as
it
is
aroused
is
transformed
into
hatred
these
general
indications
furnish
us
already
with
a
presentiment
of
the
nature
of
the
convictions
of
crowds
when
these
convictions
are
closely
examined
whether
at
epochs
marked
by
fervent
religious
faith
or
by
great
political
upheavals
such
as
those
of
the
last
century
it
is
apparent
that
they
always
assume
a
peculiar
form
which
i
can
not
better
define
than
by
giving
it
the
name
of
a
religious
sentiment
this
sentiment
has
very
simple
characteristics
such
as
worship
of
a
being
supposed
superior
fear
of
the
power
with
which
the
being
is
credited
blind
submission
to
its
commands
inability
to
discuss
its
dogmas
the
desire
to
spread
them
and
a
tendency
to
consider
as
enemies
all
by
whom
they
are
not
accepted
whether
such
a
sentiment
apply
to
an
invisible
god
to
a
wooden
or
stone
idol
to
a
hero
or
to
a
political
conception
provided
that
it
presents
the
preceding
characteristics
its
essence
always
remains
religious
the
supernatural
and
the
miraculous
are
found
to
be
present
to
the
same
extent
crowds
unconsciously
accord
a
mysterious
power
to
the
political
formula
or
the
victorious
leader
that
for
the
moment
arouses
their
enthusiasm
a
person
is
not
religious
solely
when
he
worships
a
divinity
but
when
he
puts
all
the
resources
of
his
mind
the
complete
submission
of
his
will
and
the
ardour
of
fanaticism
at
the
service
of
a
cause
or
an
individual
who
becomes
the
goal
and
guide
of
his
thoughts
and
actions
intolerance
and
fanaticism
are
the
necessary
accompaniments
of
the
religious
sentiment
they
are
inevitably
displayed
by
those
who
believe
themselves
in
the
possession
of
the
secret
of
earthly
or
eternal
happiness
these
two
characteristics
are
to
be
found
in
all
men
grouped
together
when
they
are
inspired
by
a
conviction
of
any
kind
the
jacobins
of
the
reign
of
terror
were
at
bottom
as
religious
as
the
catholics
of
the
inquisition
and
their
cruel
ardour
proceeded
from
the
same
source
the
convictions
of
crowds
assume
those
characteristics
of
blind
submission
fierce
intolerance
and
the
need
of
violent
propaganda
which
are
inherent
in
the
religious
sentiment
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
it
may
be
said
that
all
their
beliefs
have
a
religious
form
the
hero
acclaimed
by
a
crowd
is
a
veritable
god
for
that
crowd
napoleon
was
such
a
god
for
fifteen
years
and
a
divinity
never
had
more
fervent
worshippers
or
sent
men
to
their
death
with
greater
ease
the
christian
and
pagan
gods
never
exercised
a
more
absolute
empire
over
the
minds
that
had
fallen
under
their
sway
all
founders
of
religious
or
political
creeds
have
established
them
solely
because
they
were
successful
in
inspiring
crowds
with
those
fanatical
sentiments
which
have
as
result
that
men
find
their
happiness
in
worship
and
obedience
and
are
ready
to
lay
down
their
lives
for
their
idol
this
has
been
the
case
at
all
epochs
fustel
de
coulanges
in
his
excellent
work
on
roman
gaul
justly
remarks
that
the
roman
empire
was
in
no
wise
maintained
by
force
but
by
the
religious
admiration
it
inspired
it
would
be
without
a
parallel
in
the
history
of
the
world
he
observes
rightly
that
a
form
of
government
held
in
popular
detestation
should
have
lasted
for
five
centuries
it
would
be
inexplicable
that
the
thirty
legions
of
the
empire
should
have
constrained
a
hundred
million
men
to
obedience
the
reason
of
their
obedience
was
that
the
emperor
who
personified
the
greatness
of
rome
was
worshipped
like
a
divinity
by
unanimous
consent
there
were
altars
in
honour
of
the
emperor
in
the
smallest
townships
of
his
realm
from
one
end
of
the
empire
to
the
other
a
new
religion
was
seen
to
arise
in
those
days
which
had
for
its
divinities
the
emperors
themselves
some
years
before
the
christian
era
the
whole
of
gaul
represented
by
sixty
cities
built
in
common
a
temple
near
the
town
of
lyons
in
honour
of
augustus
its
priests
elected
by
the
united
gallic
cities
were
the
principal
personages
in
their
country
it
is
impossible
to
attribute
all
this
to
fear
and
servility
whole
nations
are
not
servile
and
especially
for
three
centuries
it
was
not
the
courtiers
who
worshipped
the
prince
it
was
rome
and
it
was
not
rome
merely
but
it
was
gaul
it
was
spain
it
was
greece
and
asia
the
majority
of
the
great
men
who
have
swayed
men
minds
no
longer
have
altars
but
they
have
statues
or
their
portraits
are
in
the
hands
of
their
admirers
and
the
cult
of
which
they
are
the
object
is
not
notably
different
from
that
accorded
to
their
predecessors
an
understanding
of
the
philosophy
of
history
is
only
to
be
got
by
a
thorough
appreciation
of
this
fundamental
point
of
the
psychology
of
crowds
the
crowd
demands
a
god
before
everything
else
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
these
are
the
superstitions
of
a
bygone
age
which
reason
has
definitely
banished
sentiment
has
never
been
vanquished
in
its
eternal
conflict
with
reason
crowds
will
hear
no
more
of
the
words
divinity
and
religion
in
whose
name
they
were
so
long
enslaved
but
they
have
never
possessed
so
many
fetishes
as
in
the
last
hundred
years
and
the
old
divinities
have
never
had
so
many
statues
and
altars
raised
in
their
honour
those
who
in
recent
years
have
studied
the
popular
movement
known
under
the
name
of
boulangism
have
been
able
to
see
with
what
ease
the
religious
instincts
of
crowds
are
ready
to
revive
there
was
not
a
country
inn
that
did
not
possess
the
hero
portrait
he
was
credited
with
the
power
of
remedying
all
injustices
and
all
evils
and
thousands
of
men
would
have
given
their
lives
for
him
great
might
have
been
his
place
in
history
had
his
character
been
at
all
on
a
level
with
his
legendary
reputation
it
is
thus
a
very
useless
commonplace
to
assert
that
a
religion
is
necessary
for
the
masses
because
all
political
divine
and
social
creeds
only
take
root
among
them
on
the
condition
of
always
assuming
the
religious
shape
a
shape
which
obviates
the
danger
of
discussion
were
it
possible
to
induce
the
masses
to
adopt
atheism
this
belief
would
exhibit
all
the
intolerant
ardour
of
a
religious
sentiment
and
in
its
exterior
forms
would
soon
become
a
cult
the
evolution
of
the
small
positivist
sect
furnishes
us
a
curious
proof
in
point
what
happened
to
the
nihilist
whose
story
is
related
by
that
profound
thinker
dostoiewsky
has
quickly
happened
to
the
positivists
illumined
one
day
by
the
light
of
reason
he
broke
the
images
of
divinities
and
saints
that
adorned
the
altar
of
a
chapel
extinguished
the
candles
and
without
losing
a
moment
replaced
the
destroyed
objects
by
the
works
of
atheistic
philosophers
such
as
buchner
and
moleschott
after
which
he
piously
relighted
the
candles
the
object
of
his
religious
beliefs
had
been
transformed
but
can
it
be
truthfully
said
that
his
religious
sentiments
had
changed
certain
historical
events
and
they
are
precisely
the
most
important
i
again
repeat
are
not
to
be
understood
unless
one
has
attained
to
an
appreciation
of
the
religious
form
which
the
convictions
of
crowds
always
assume
in
the
long
run
there
are
social
phenomena
that
need
to
be
studied
far
more
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
psychologist
than
from
that
of
the
naturalist
the
great
historian
taine
has
only
studied
the
revolution
as
a
naturalist
and
on
this
account
the
real
genesis
of
events
has
often
escaped
him
he
has
perfectly
observed
the
facts
but
from
want
of
having
studied
the
psychology
of
crowds
he
has
not
always
been
able
to
trace
their
causes
the
facts
having
appalled
him
by
their
bloodthirsty
anarchic
and
ferocious
side
he
has
scarcely
seen
in
the
heroes
of
the
great
drama
anything
more
than
a
horde
of
epileptic
savages
abandoning
themselves
without
restraint
to
their
instincts
the
violence
of
the
revolution
its
massacres
its
need
of
propaganda
its
declarations
of
war
upon
all
things
are
only
to
be
properly
explained
by
reflecting
that
the
revolution
was
merely
the
establishment
of
a
new
religious
belief
in
the
mind
of
the
masses
the
reformation
the
massacre
of
saint
bartholomew
the
french
religious
wars
the
inquisition
the
reign
of
terror
are
phenomena
of
an
identical
kind
brought
about
by
crowds
animated
by
those
religious
sentiments
which
necessarily
lead
those
imbued
with
them
to
pitilessly
extirpate
by
fire
and
sword
whoever
is
opposed
to
the
establishment
of
the
new
faith
the
methods
of
the
inquisition
are
those
of
all
whose
convictions
are
genuine
and
sturdy
their
convictions
would
not
deserve
these
epithets
did
they
resort
to
other
methods
upheavals
analogous
to
those
i
have
just
cited
are
only
possible
when
it
is
the
soul
of
the
masses
that
brings
them
about
the
most
absolute
despots
could
not
cause
them
when
historians
tell
us
that
the
massacre
of
saint
bartholomew
was
the
work
of
a
king
they
show
themselves
as
ignorant
of
the
psychology
of
crowds
as
of
that
of
sovereigns
manifestations
of
this
order
can
only
proceed
from
the
soul
of
crowds
the
most
absolute
power
of
the
most
despotic
monarch
can
scarcely
do
more
than
hasten
or
retard
the
moment
of
their
apparition
the
massacre
of
saint
bartholomew
or
the
religious
wars
were
no
more
the
work
of
kings
than
the
reign
of
terror
was
the
work
of
robespierre
danton
or
saint
just
at
the
bottom
of
such
events
is
always
to
be
found
the
working
of
the
soul
of
the
masses
and
never
the
power
of
potentates

of

shelter

under

may
come
to
be
created

as

by
various
peoples
having
studied
the
mental
constitution
of
crowds
and
become
acquainted
with
their
modes
of
feeling
thinking
and
reasoning
we
shall
now
proceed
to
examine
how
their
opinions
and
beliefs
arise
and
become
established
the
factors
which
determine
these
opinions
and
beliefs
are
of
two
kinds
remote
factors
and
immediate
factors
the
remote
factors
are
those
which
render
crowds
capable
of
adopting
certain
convictions
and
absolutely
refractory
to
the
acceptance
of
others
these
factors
prepare
the
ground
in
which
are
suddenly
seen
to
germinate
certain
new
ideas
whose
force
and
consequences
are
a
cause
of
astonishment
though
they
are
only
spontaneous
in
appearance
the
outburst
and
putting
in
practice
of
certain
ideas
among
crowds
present
at
times
a
startling
suddenness
this
is
only
a
superficial
effect
behind
which
must
be
sought
a
preliminary
and
preparatory
action
of
long
duration
the
immediate
factors
are
those
which
coming
on
the
top
of
this
long
preparatory
working
in
whose
absence
they
would
remain
without
effect
serve
as
the
source
of
active
persuasion
on
crowds
that
is
they
are
the
factors
which
cause
the
idea
to
take
shape
and
set
it
loose
with
all
its
consequences
the
resolutions
by
which
collectivities
are
suddenly
carried
away
arise
out
of
these
immediate
factors
it
is
due
to
them
that
a
riot
breaks
out
or
a
strike
is
decided
upon
and
to
them
that
enormous
majorities
invest
one
man
with
power
to
overthrow
a
government
the
successive
action
of
these
two
kinds
of
factors
is
to
be
traced
in
all
great
historical
events
the
french
revolution
to
cite
but
one
of
the
most
striking
of
such
events
had
among
its
remote
factors
the
writings
of
the
philosophers
the
exactions
of
the
nobility
and
the
progress
of
scientific
thought
the
mind
of
the
masses
thus
prepared
was
then
easily
roused
by
such
immediate
factors
as
the
speeches
of
orators
and
the
resistance
of
the
court
party
to
insignificant
reforms
among
the
remote
factors
there
are
some
of
a
general
nature
which
are
found
to
underlie
all
the
beliefs
and
opinions
of
crowds
they
are
race
traditions
time
institutions
and
education
we
now
proceed
to
study
the
influence
of
these
different
factors
race
this
factor
race
must
be
placed
in
the
first
rank
for
in
itself
it
far
surpasses
in
importance
all
the
others
we
have
sufficiently
studied
it
in
another
work
it
is
therefore
needless
to
deal
with
it
again
we
showed
in
a
previous
volume
what
an
historical
race
is
and
how
its
character
once
formed
it
possesses
as
the
result
of
the
laws
of
heredity
such
power
that
its
beliefs
institutions
and
arts
in
a
word
all
the
elements
of
its
civilisation
are
merely
the
outward
expression
of
its
genius
we
showed
that
the
power
of
the
race
is
such
that
no
element
can
pass
from
one
people
to
another
without
undergoing
the
most
profound
transformations
the
novelty
of
this
proposition
being
still
considerable
and
history
being
quite
unintelligible
without
it
i
devoted
four
chapters
to
its
demonstration
in
my
last
book
the
psychological
laws
of
the
evolution
of
peoples
from
it
the
reader
will
see
that
in
spite
of
fallacious
appearances
neither
language
religion
arts
or
in
a
word
any
element
of
civilisation
can
pass
intact
from
one
people
to
another
environment
circumstances
and
events
represent
the
social
suggestions
of
the
moment
they
may
have
a
considerable
influence
but
this
influence
is
always
momentary
if
it
be
contrary
to
the
suggestions
of
the
race
that
is
to
those
which
are
inherited
by
a
nation
from
the
entire
series
of
its
ancestors
we
shall
have
occasion
in
several
of
the
chapters
of
this
work
to
touch
again
upon
racial
influence
and
to
show
that
this
influence
is
so
great
that
it
dominates
the
characteristics
peculiar
to
the
genius
of
crowds
it
follows
from
this
fact
that
the
crowds
of
different
countries
offer
very
considerable
differences
of
beliefs
and
conduct
and
are
not
to
be
influenced
in
the
same
manner
traditions
traditions
represent
the
ideas
the
needs
and
the
sentiments
of
the
past
they
are
the
synthesis
of
the
race
and
weigh
upon
us
with
immense
force
the
biological
sciences
have
been
transformed
since
embryology
has
shown
the
immense
influence
of
the
past
on
the
evolution
of
living
beings
and
the
historical
sciences
will
not
undergo
a
less
change
when
this
conception
has
become
more
widespread
as
yet
it
is
not
sufficiently
general
and
many
statesmen
are
still
no
further
advanced
than
the
theorists
of
the
last
century
who
believed
that
a
society
could
break
off
with
its
past
and
be
entirely
recast
on
lines
suggested
solely
by
the
light
of
reason
a
people
is
an
organism
created
by
the
past
and
like
every
other
organism
it
can
only
be
modified
by
slow
hereditary
accumulations
it
is
tradition
that
guides
men
and
more
especially
so
when
they
are
in
a
crowd
the
changes
they
can
effect
in
their
traditions
with
any
ease
merely
bear
as
i
have
often
repeated
upon
names
and
outward
forms
this
circumstance
is
not
to
be
regretted
neither
a
national
genius
nor
civilisation
would
be
possible
without
traditions
in
consequence
man
two
great
concerns
since
he
has
existed
have
been
to
create
a
network
of
traditions
which
he
afterwards
endeavours
to
destroy
when
their
beneficial
effects
have
worn
themselves
out
civilisation
is
impossible
without
traditions
and
progress
impossible
without
the
destruction
of
those
traditions
the
difficulty
and
it
is
an
immense
difficulty
is
to
find
a
proper
equilibrium
between
stability
and
variability
should
a
people
allow
its
customs
to
become
too
firmly
rooted
it
can
no
longer
change
and
becomes
like
china
incapable
of
improvement
violent
revolutions
are
in
this
case
of
no
avail
for
what
happens
is
that
either
the
broken
fragments
of
the
chain
are
pieced
together
again
and
the
past
resumes
its
empire
without
change
or
the
fragments
remain
apart
and
decadence
soon
succeeds
anarchy
the
ideal
for
a
people
is
in
consequence
to
preserve
the
institutions
of
the
past
merely
changing
them
insensibly
and
little
by
little
this
ideal
is
difficult
to
realise
the
romans
in
ancient
and
the
english
in
modern
times
are
almost
alone
in
having
realised
it
it
is
precisely
crowds
that
cling
the
most
tenaciously
to
traditional
ideas
and
oppose
their
being
changed
with
the
most
obstinacy
this
is
notably
the
case
with
the
category
of
crowds
constituting
castes
i
have
already
insisted
upon
the
conservative
spirit
of
crowds
and
shown
that
the
most
violent
rebellions
merely
end
in
a
changing
of
words
and
terms
at
the
end
of
the
last
century
in
the
presence
of
destroyed
churches
of
priests
expelled
the
country
or
guillotined
it
might
have
been
thought
that
the
old
religious
ideas
had
lost
all
their
strength
and
yet
a
few
years
had
barely
lapsed
before
the
abolished
system
of
public
worship
had
to
be
in
deference
to
universal
demands
the
report
of
the
fourcroy
quoted
by
taine
is
very
clear
on
this
point
what
is
everywhere
seen
with
respect
to
the
keeping
of
sunday
and
attendance
at
the
churches
proves
that
the
majority
of
frenchmen
desire
to
return
to
their
old
usages
and
that
it
is
no
longer
opportune
to
resist
this
natural
tendency
the
great
majority
of
men
stand
in
need
of
religion
public
worship
and
priests
it
is
an
error
of
some
modern
philosophers
by
which
i
myself
have
been
led
away
to
believe
in
the
possibility
of
instruction
being
so
general
as
to
destroy
religious
prejudices
which
for
a
great
number
of
unfortunate
persons
are
a
source
of
consolation
the
mass
of
the
people
then
must
be
allowed
its
priests
its
altars
and
its
public
worship
blotted
out
for
a
moment
the
old
traditions
had
resumed
their
sway
no
example
could
better
display
the
power
of
tradition
on
the
mind
of
crowds
the
most
redoubtable
idols
do
not
dwell
in
temples
nor
the
most
despotic
tyrants
in
palaces
both
the
one
and
the
other
can
be
broken
in
an
instant
but
the
invisible
masters
that
reign
in
our
innermost
selves
are
safe
from
every
effort
at
revolt
and
only
yield
to
the
slow
wearing
away
of
centuries
time
in
social
as
in
biological
problems
time
is
one
of
the
most
energetic
factors
it
is
the
sole
real
creator
and
the
sole
great
destroyer
it
is
time
that
has
made
mountains
with
grains
of
sand
and
raised
the
obscure
cell
of
geological
eras
to
human
dignity
the
action
of
centuries
is
sufficient
to
transform
any
given
phenomenon
it
has
been
justly
observed
that
an
ant
with
enough
time
at
its
disposal
could
level
mount
blanc
a
being
possessed
of
the
magical
force
of
varying
time
at
his
will
would
have
the
power
attributed
by
believers
to
god
in
this
place
however
we
have
only
to
concern
ourselves
with
the
influence
of
time
on
the
genesis
of
the
opinions
of
crowds
its
action
from
this
point
of
view
is
still
immense
dependent
upon
it
are
the
great
forces
such
as
race
which
can
not
form
themselves
without
it
it
causes
the
birth
the
growth
and
the
death
of
all
beliefs
it
is
by
the
aid
of
time
that
they
acquire
their
strength
and
also
by
its
aid
that
they
lose
it
it
is
time
in
particular
that
prepares
the
opinions
and
beliefs
of
crowds
or
at
least
the
soil
on
which
they
will
germinate
this
is
why
certain
ideas
are
realisable
at
one
epoch
and
not
at
another
it
is
time
that
accumulates
that
immense
detritus
of
beliefs
and
thoughts
on
which
the
ideas
of
a
given
period
spring
up
they
do
not
grow
at
hazard
and
by
chance
the
roots
of
each
of
them
strike
down
into
a
long
past
when
they
blossom
it
is
time
that
has
prepared
their
blooming
and
to
arrive
at
a
notion
of
their
genesis
it
is
always
back
in
the
past
that
it
is
necessary
to
search
they
are
the
daughters
of
the
past
and
the
mothers
of
the
future
but
throughout
the
slaves
of
time
time
in
consequence
is
our
veritable
master
and
it
suffices
to
leave
it
free
to
act
to
see
all
things
transformed
at
the
present
day
we
are
very
uneasy
with
regard
to
the
threatening
aspirations
of
the
masses
and
the
destructions
and
upheavals
foreboded
thereby
time
without
other
aid
will
see
to
the
restoration
of
equilibrium
no
form
of
government
lavisse
very
properly
writes
was
founded
in
a
day
political
and
social
organisations
are
works
that
demand
centuries
the
feudal
system
existed
for
centuries
in
a
shapeless
chaotic
state
before
it
found
its
laws
absolute
monarchy
also
existed
for
centuries
before
arriving
at
regular
methods
of
government
and
these
periods
of
expectancy
were
extremely
troubled
political
and
social
institutions
the
idea
that
institutions
can
remedy
the
defects
of
societies
that
national
progress
is
the
consequence
of
the
improvement
of
institutions
and
governments
and
that
social
changes
can
be
effected
by
decrees
this
idea
i
say
is
still
generally
accepted
it
was
the
of
the
french
revolution
and
the
social
theories
of
the
present
day
are
based
upon
it
the
most
continuous
experience
has
been
unsuccessful
in
shaking
this
grave
delusion
philosophers
and
historians
have
endeavoured
in
vain
to
prove
its
absurdity
but
yet
they
have
had
no
difficulty
in
demonstrating
that
institutions
are
the
outcome
of
ideas
sentiments
and
customs
and
that
ideas
sentiments
and
customs
are
not
to
be
recast
by
recasting
legislative
codes
a
nation
does
not
choose
its
institutions
at
will
any
more
than
it
chooses
the
colour
of
its
hair
or
its
eyes
institutions
and
governments
are
the
product
of
the
race
they
are
not
the
creators
of
an
epoch
but
are
created
by
it
peoples
are
not
governed
in
accordance
with
their
caprices
of
the
moment
but
as
their
character
determines
that
they
shall
be
governed
centuries
are
required
to
form
a
political
system
and
centuries
needed
to
change
it
institutions
have
no
intrinsic
virtue
in
themselves
they
are
neither
good
nor
bad
those
which
are
good
at
a
given
moment
for
a
given
people
may
be
harmful
in
the
extreme
for
another
nation
moreover
it
is
in
no
way
in
the
power
of
a
people
to
really
change
its
institutions
undoubtedly
at
the
cost
of
violent
revolutions
it
can
change
their
name
but
in
their
essence
they
remain
unmodified
the
names
are
mere
futile
labels
with
which
an
historian
who
goes
to
the
bottom
of
things
need
scarcely
concern
himself
it
is
in
this
way
for
instance
that
england
the
most
democratic
country
in
the
world
lives
nevertheless
under
a
monarchical
regime
whereas
the
countries
in
which
the
most
oppressive
despotism
is
rampant
are
the
republics
in
spite
of
their
republican
constitutions
the
destinies
of
peoples
are
determined
by
their
character
and
not
by
their
government
i
have
endeavoured
to
establish
this
view
in
my
previous
volume
by
setting
forth
categorical
examples
the
most
advanced
republicans
even
of
the
united
states
recognise
this
fact
the
american
magazine
the
forum
recently
gave
categorical
expression
to
the
opinion
in
terms
which
i
reproduce
here
from
the
review
of
reviews
for
december
it
should
never
be
forgotten
even
by
the
most
ardent
enemies
of
an
aristocracy
that
england
is
the
most
democratic
country
of
the
universe
the
country
in
which
the
rights
of
the
individual
are
most
respected
and
in
which
the
individual
possesses
the
most
liberty
to
lose
time
in
the
manufacture
of
constitutions
is
in
consequence
a
puerile
task
the
useless
labour
of
an
ignorant
rhetorician
necessity
and
time
undertake
the
charge
of
elaborating
constitutions
when
we
are
wise
enough
to
allow
these
two
factors
to
act
this
is
the
plan
the
have
adopted
as
their
great
historian
macaulay
teaches
us
in
a
passage
that
the
politicians
of
all
latin
countries
ought
to
learn
by
heart
after
having
shown
all
the
good
that
can
be
accomplished
by
laws
which
appear
from
the
point
of
view
of
pure
reason
a
chaos
of
absurdities
and
contradictions
he
compares
the
scores
of
constitutions
that
have
been
engulfed
in
the
convulsions
of
the
latin
peoples
with
that
of
england
and
points
out
that
the
latter
has
only
been
very
slowly
changed
part
by
part
under
the
influence
of
immediate
necessities
and
never
of
speculative
reasoning
to
think
nothing
of
symmetry
and
much
of
convenience
never
to
remove
an
anomaly
merely
because
it
is
an
anomaly
never
to
innovate
except
when
some
grievance
is
felt
never
to
innovate
except
so
far
as
to
get
rid
of
the
grievance
never
to
lay
down
any
proposition
of
wider
extent
than
the
particular
case
for
which
it
is
necessary
to
provide
these
are
the
rules
which
have
from
the
age
of
john
to
the
age
of
victoria
generally
guided
the
deliberations
of
our
two
hundred
and
fifty
parliaments
it
would
be
necessary
to
take
one
by
one
the
laws
and
institutions
of
each
people
to
show
to
what
extent
they
are
the
expression
of
the
needs
of
each
race
and
are
incapable
for
that
reason
of
being
violently
transformed
it
is
possible
for
instance
to
indulge
in
philosophical
dissertations
on
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
centralisation
but
when
we
see
a
people
composed
of
very
different
races
devote
a
thousand
years
of
efforts
to
attaining
to
this
centralisation
when
we
observe
that
a
great
revolution
having
for
object
the
destruction
of
all
the
institutions
of
the
past
has
been
forced
to
respect
this
centralisation
and
has
even
strengthened
it
under
these
circumstances
we
should
admit
that
it
is
the
outcome
of
imperious
needs
that
it
is
a
condition
of
the
existence
of
the
nation
in
question
and
we
should
pity
the
poor
mental
range
of
politicians
who
talk
of
destroying
it
could
they
by
chance
succeed
in
this
attempt
their
success
would
at
once
be
the
signal
for
a
frightful
civil
war
which
moreover
would
immediately
bring
back
a
new
system
of
centralisation
much
more
oppressive
than
the
old
if
a
comparison
be
made
between
the
profound
religious
and
political
dissensions
which
separate
the
various
parties
in
france
and
are
more
especially
the
result
of
social
questions
and
the
separatist
tendencies
which
were
manifested
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
and
began
to
again
display
themselves
towards
the
close
of
the
war
it
will
be
seen
that
the
different
races
represented
in
france
are
still
far
from
being
completely
blended
the
vigorous
centralisation
of
the
revolution
and
the
creation
of
artificial
departments
destined
to
bring
about
the
fusion
of
the
ancient
provinces
was
certainly
its
most
useful
work
were
it
possible
to
bring
about
the
decentralisation
which
is
preoccupying
minds
lacking
in
foresight
the
achievement
would
promptly
have
for
consequence
the
most
sanguinary
disorders
to
overlook
this
fact
is
to
leave
out
of
account
the
entire
history
of
france
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
what
precedes
is
that
it
is
not
in
institutions
that
the
means
is
to
be
sought
of
profoundly
influencing
the
genius
of
the
masses
when
we
see
certain
countries
such
as
the
united
states
reach
a
high
degree
of
prosperity
under
democratic
institutions
while
others
such
as
the
republics
are
found
existing
in
a
pitiable
state
of
anarchy
under
absolutely
similar
institutions
we
should
admit
that
these
institutions
are
as
foreign
to
the
greatness
of
the
one
as
to
the
decadence
of
the
others
peoples
are
governed
by
their
character
and
all
institutions
which
are
not
intimately
modelled
on
that
character
merely
represent
a
borrowed
garment
a
transitory
disguise
no
doubt
sanguinary
wars
and
violent
revolutions
have
been
undertaken
and
will
continue
to
be
undertaken
to
impose
institutions
to
which
is
attributed
as
to
the
relics
of
saints
the
supernatural
power
of
creating
welfare
it
may
be
said
then
in
one
sense
that
institutions
react
on
the
mind
of
the
crowd
inasmuch
as
they
engender
such
upheavals
but
in
reality
it
is
not
the
institutions
that
react
in
this
manner
since
we
know
that
whether
triumphant
or
vanquished
they
possess
in
themselves
no
virtue
it
is
illusions
and
words
that
have
influenced
the
mind
of
the
crowd
and
especially
words
words
which
are
as
powerful
as
they
are
chimerical
and
whose
astonishing
sway
we
shall
shortly
demonstrate
instruction
and
education
foremost
among
the
dominant
ideas
of
the
present
epoch
is
to
be
found
the
notion
that
instruction
is
capable
of
considerably
changing
men
and
has
for
its
unfailing
consequence
to
improve
them
and
even
to
make
them
equal
by
the
mere
fact
of
its
being
constantly
repeated
this
assertion
has
ended
by
becoming
one
of
the
most
steadfast
democratic
dogmas
it
would
be
as
difficult
now
to
attack
it
as
it
would
have
been
formerly
to
have
attacked
the
dogmas
of
the
church
on
this
point
however
as
on
many
others
democratic
ideas
are
in
profound
disagreement
with
the
results
of
psychology
and
experience
many
eminent
philosophers
among
them
herbert
spencer
have
had
no
difficulty
in
showing
that
instruction
neither
renders
a
man
more
moral
nor
happier
that
it
changes
neither
his
instincts
nor
his
hereditary
passions
and
that
at
times
for
this
to
happen
it
need
only
be
badly
directed
it
is
much
more
pernicious
than
useful
statisticians
have
brought
confirmation
of
these
views
by
telling
us
that
criminality
increases
with
the
generalisation
of
instruction
or
at
any
rate
of
a
certain
kind
of
instruction
and
that
the
worst
enemies
of
society
the
anarchists
are
recruited
among
the
of
schools
while
in
a
recent
work
a
distinguished
magistrate
adolphe
guillot
made
the
observation
that
at
present
educated
criminals
are
met
with
for
every
illiterate
delinquents
and
that
in
fifty
years
the
criminal
percentage
of
the
population
has
passed
from
to
for
every
inhabitants
an
increase
of
per
cent
he
has
also
noted
in
common
with
his
colleagues
that
criminality
is
particularly
on
the
increase
among
young
persons
for
whom
as
is
known
gratuitous
and
obligatory
schooling
has
in
france
replaced
apprenticeship
it
is
not
assuredly
and
nobody
has
ever
maintained
this
proposition
that
instruction
may
not
give
very
useful
practical
results
if
not
in
the
sense
of
raising
the
standard
of
morality
at
least
in
that
of
developing
professional
capacity
unfortunately
the
latin
peoples
especially
in
the
last
years
have
based
their
systems
of
instruction
on
very
erroneous
principles
and
in
spite
of
the
observations
of
the
most
eminent
minds
such
as
breal
fustel
de
coulanges
taine
and
many
others
they
persist
in
their
lamentable
mistakes
i
have
myself
shown
in
a
work
published
some
time
ago
that
the
french
system
of
education
transforms
the
majority
of
those
who
have
undergone
it
into
enemies
of
society
and
recruits
numerous
disciples
for
the
worst
forms
of
socialism
the
primary
danger
of
this
system
of
education
very
properly
qualified
as
latin
consists
in
the
fact
that
it
is
based
on
the
fundamental
psychological
error
that
the
intelligence
is
developed
by
the
learning
by
heart
of
adopting
this
view
the
endeavour
has
been
made
to
enforce
a
knowledge
of
as
many
as
possible
from
the
primary
school
till
he
leaves
the
university
a
young
man
does
nothing
but
acquire
books
by
heart
without
his
judgment
or
personal
initiative
being
ever
called
into
play
education
consists
for
him
in
reciting
by
heart
and
obeying
learning
lessons
knowing
by
heart
a
grammar
or
a
compendium
repeating
well
and
imitating
well
that
writes
a
former
minister
of
public
instruction
jules
simon
is
a
ludicrous
form
of
education
whose
every
effort
is
an
act
of
faith
tacitly
admitting
the
infallibility
of
the
master
and
whose
only
results
are
a
belittling
of
ourselves
and
a
rendering
of
us
impotent
were
this
education
merely
useless
one
might
confine
one
self
to
expressing
compassion
for
the
unhappy
children
who
instead
of
making
needful
studies
at
the
primary
school
are
instructed
in
the
genealogy
of
the
sons
of
clotaire
the
conflicts
between
neustria
and
austrasia
or
zoological
classifications
but
the
system
presents
a
far
more
serious
danger
it
gives
those
who
have
been
submitted
to
it
a
violent
dislike
to
the
state
of
life
in
which
they
were
born
and
an
intense
desire
to
escape
from
it
the
working
man
no
longer
wishes
to
remain
a
working
man
or
the
peasant
to
continue
a
peasant
while
the
most
humble
members
of
the
middle
classes
admit
of
no
possible
career
for
their
sons
except
that
of
functionaries
instead
of
preparing
men
for
life
french
schools
solely
prepare
them
to
occupy
public
functions
in
which
success
can
be
attained
without
any
necessity
for
or
the
exhibition
of
the
least
glimmer
of
personal
initiative
at
the
bottom
of
the
social
ladder
the
system
creates
an
army
of
proletarians
discontented
with
their
lot
and
always
ready
to
revolt
while
at
the
summit
it
brings
into
being
a
frivolous
bourgeoisie
at
once
sceptical
and
credulous
having
a
superstitious
confidence
in
the
state
whom
it
regards
as
a
sort
of
providence
but
without
forgetting
to
display
towards
it
a
ceaseless
hostility
always
laying
its
own
faults
to
the
door
of
the
government
and
incapable
of
the
least
enterprise
without
the
intervention
of
the
authorities
the
state
which
manufactures
by
dint
of
textbooks
all
these
persons
possessing
diplomas
can
only
utilise
a
small
number
of
them
and
is
forced
to
leave
the
others
without
employment
it
is
obliged
in
consequence
to
resign
itself
to
feeding
the
first
mentioned
and
to
having
the
others
as
its
enemies
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
social
pyramid
from
the
humblest
clerk
to
the
professor
and
the
prefect
the
immense
mass
of
persons
boasting
diplomas
besiege
the
professions
while
a
business
man
has
the
greatest
difficulty
in
finding
an
agent
to
represent
him
in
the
colonies
thousands
of
candidates
solicit
the
most
modest
official
posts
there
are
schoolmasters
and
mistresses
without
employment
in
the
department
of
the
seine
alone
all
of
them
persons
who
disdaining
the
fields
or
the
workshops
look
to
the
state
for
their
livelihood
the
number
of
the
chosen
being
restricted
that
of
the
discontented
is
perforce
immense
the
latter
are
ready
for
any
revolution
whoever
be
its
chiefs
and
whatever
the
goal
they
aim
at
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
for
which
no
use
can
be
found
is
a
sure
method
of
driving
a
man
to
revolt
this
phenomenon
moreover
is
not
peculiar
to
the
latin
peoples
it
is
also
to
be
observed
in
china
which
is
also
a
country
in
the
hands
of
a
solid
hierarchy
of
mandarins
or
functionaries
and
where
a
function
is
obtained
as
in
france
by
competitive
examination
in
which
the
only
test
is
the
imperturbable
recitation
of
bulky
manuals
the
army
of
educated
persons
without
employment
is
considered
in
china
at
the
present
day
as
a
veritable
national
calamity
it
is
the
same
in
india
where
since
the
english
have
opened
schools
not
for
educating
purposes
as
is
the
case
in
england
itself
but
simply
to
furnish
the
indigenous
inhabitants
with
instruction
there
has
been
formed
a
special
class
of
educated
persons
the
baboos
who
when
they
do
not
obtain
employment
become
the
irreconcilable
enemies
of
the
english
rule
in
the
case
of
all
the
baboos
whether
provided
with
employment
or
not
the
first
effect
of
their
instruction
has
been
to
lower
their
standard
of
morality
this
is
a
fact
on
which
i
have
insisted
at
length
in
my
book
the
civilisations
of
india
a
fact
too
which
has
been
observed
by
all
authors
who
have
visited
the
great
peninsula
it
is
evidently
too
late
to
retrace
our
steps
experience
alone
that
supreme
educator
of
peoples
will
be
at
pains
to
show
us
our
mistake
it
alone
will
be
powerful
enough
to
prove
the
necessity
of
replacing
our
odious
and
our
pitiable
examinations
by
industrial
instruction
capable
of
inducing
our
young
men
to
return
to
the
fields
to
the
workshop
and
to
the
colonial
enterprise
which
they
avoid
at
all
costs
the
professional
instruction
which
all
enlightened
minds
are
now
demanding
was
the
instruction
received
in
the
past
by
our
forefathers
it
is
still
in
vigour
at
the
present
day
among
the
nations
who
rule
the
world
by
their
force
of
will
their
initiative
and
their
spirit
of
enterprise
in
a
series
of
remarkable
pages
whose
principal
passages
i
reproduce
further
on
a
great
thinker
taine
has
clearly
shown
that
our
former
system
of
education
was
approximately
that
in
vogue
in
england
and
america
and
in
a
remarkable
parallel
between
the
latin
and
systems
he
has
plainly
pointed
out
the
consequences
of
the
two
methods
one
might
consent
perhaps
at
a
pinch
to
continue
to
accept
all
the
disadvantages
of
our
classical
education
although
it
produced
nothing
but
discontented
men
and
men
unfitted
for
their
station
in
life
did
the
superficial
acquisition
of
so
much
knowledge
the
faultless
repeating
by
heart
of
so
many
raise
the
level
of
intelligence
but
does
it
really
raise
this
level
alas
no
the
conditions
of
success
in
life
are
the
possession
of
judgment
experience
initiative
and
character
qualities
which
are
not
bestowed
by
books
books
are
dictionaries
which
it
is
useful
to
consult
but
of
which
it
is
perfectly
useless
to
have
lengthy
portions
in
one
head
how
is
it
possible
for
professional
instruction
to
develop
the
intelligence
in
a
measure
quite
beyond
the
reach
of
classical
instruction
this
has
been
well
shown
by
taine
ideas
he
says
are
only
formed
in
their
natural
and
normal
surroundings
the
promotion
of
the
growth
is
effected
by
the
innumerable
impressions
appealing
to
the
senses
which
a
young
man
receives
daily
in
the
workshop
the
mine
the
law
court
the
study
the
builder
yard
the
hospital
at
the
sight
of
tools
materials
and
operations
in
the
presence
of
customers
workers
and
labour
of
work
well
or
ill
done
costly
or
lucrative
in
such
a
way
are
obtained
those
trifling
perceptions
of
detail
of
the
eyes
the
ear
the
hands
and
even
the
sense
of
smell
which
picked
up
involuntarily
and
silently
elaborated
take
shape
within
the
learner
and
suggest
to
him
sooner
or
later
this
or
that
new
combination
simplification
economy
improvement
or
invention
the
young
frenchman
is
deprived
and
precisely
at
the
age
when
they
are
most
fruitful
of
all
these
precious
contacts
of
all
these
indispensable
elements
of
assimilation
for
seven
or
eight
years
on
end
he
is
shut
up
in
a
school
and
is
cut
off
from
that
direct
personal
experience
which
would
give
him
a
keen
and
exact
notion
of
men
and
things
and
of
the
various
ways
of
handling
them
at
least
nine
out
of
ten
have
wasted
their
time
and
pains
during
several
years
of
their
life
telling
important
even
decisive
years
among
such
are
to
be
counted
first
of
all
the
half
or
of
those
who
present
themselves
for
examination
i
refer
to
those
who
are
rejected
and
then
among
those
who
are
successful
who
obtain
a
degree
a
certificate
a
diploma
there
is
still
a
half
or
i
refer
to
the
overworked
too
much
has
been
demanded
of
them
by
exacting
that
on
a
given
day
on
a
chair
or
before
a
board
they
should
for
two
hours
in
succession
and
with
respect
to
a
group
of
sciences
be
living
repertories
of
all
human
knowledge
in
point
of
fact
they
were
that
or
nearly
so
for
two
hours
on
that
particular
day
but
a
month
later
they
are
so
no
longer
they
could
not
go
through
the
examination
again
their
too
numerous
and
too
burdensome
acquisitions
slip
incessantly
from
their
mind
and
are
not
replaced
their
mental
vigour
has
declined
their
fertile
capacity
for
growth
has
dried
up
the
man
appears
and
he
is
often
a
man
settled
down
married
resigned
to
turning
in
a
circle
and
indefinitely
in
the
same
circle
he
shuts
himself
up
in
his
confined
function
which
he
fulfils
adequately
but
nothing
more
such
is
the
average
yield
assuredly
the
receipts
do
not
balance
the
expenditure
in
england
or
america
where
as
in
france
previous
to
the
contrary
proceeding
is
adopted
the
outcome
obtained
is
equal
or
superior
the
illustrious
psychologist
subsequently
shows
us
the
difference
between
our
system
and
that
of
the
the
latter
do
not
possess
our
innumerable
special
schools
with
them
instruction
is
not
based
on
but
on
object
lessons
the
engineer
for
example
is
trained
in
a
workshop
and
never
at
a
school
a
method
which
allows
of
each
individual
reaching
the
level
his
intelligence
permits
of
he
becomes
a
workman
or
a
foreman
if
he
can
get
no
further
an
engineer
if
his
aptitudes
take
him
as
far
this
manner
of
proceeding
is
much
more
democratic
and
of
much
greater
benefit
to
society
than
that
of
making
the
whole
career
of
an
individual
depend
on
an
examination
lasting
a
few
hours
and
undergone
at
the
age
of
nineteen
or
twenty
in
the
hospital
the
mine
the
factory
in
the
architect
or
the
lawyer
office
the
student
who
makes
a
start
while
very
young
goes
through
his
apprenticeship
stage
by
stage
much
as
does
with
us
a
law
clerk
in
his
office
or
an
artist
in
his
studio
previously
and
before
making
a
practical
beginning
he
has
had
an
opportunity
of
following
some
general
and
summary
course
of
instruction
so
as
to
have
a
framework
ready
prepared
in
which
to
store
the
observations
he
is
shortly
to
make
furthermore
he
is
able
as
a
rule
to
avail
himself
of
sundry
technical
courses
which
he
can
follow
in
his
leisure
hours
so
as
to
step
by
step
the
daily
experience
he
is
gathering
under
such
a
system
the
practical
capabilities
increase
and
develop
of
themselves
in
exact
proportion
to
the
faculties
of
the
student
and
in
the
direction
requisite
for
his
future
task
and
the
special
work
for
which
from
now
onwards
he
desires
to
fit
himself
by
this
means
in
england
or
the
united
states
a
young
man
is
quickly
in
a
position
to
develop
his
capacity
to
the
utmost
at
years
of
age
and
much
sooner
if
the
material
and
the
parts
are
there
he
is
not
merely
a
useful
performer
he
is
capable
also
of
spontaneous
enterprise
he
is
not
only
a
part
of
a
machine
but
also
a
motor
in
france
where
the
contrary
system
prevails
in
france
which
with
each
succeeding
generation
is
falling
more
and
more
into
line
with
china
the
sum
total
of
the
wasted
forces
is
enormous
the
great
philosopher
arrives
at
the
following
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
growing
incongruity
between
our
latin
system
of
education
and
the
requirements
of
practical
life
in
the
three
stages
of
instruction
those
of
childhood
adolescence
and
youth
the
theoretical
and
pedagogic
preparation
by
books
on
the
school
benches
has
lengthened
out
and
become
overcharged
in
view
of
the
examination
the
degree
the
diploma
and
the
certificate
and
solely
in
this
view
and
by
the
worst
methods
by
the
application
of
an
unnatural
and
regime
by
the
excessive
postponement
of
the
practical
apprenticeship
by
our
system
by
artificial
training
and
mechanical
cramming
by
overwork
without
thought
for
the
time
that
is
to
follow
for
the
adult
age
and
the
functions
of
the
man
without
regard
for
the
real
world
on
which
the
young
man
will
shortly
be
thrown
for
the
society
in
which
we
move
and
to
which
he
must
be
adapted
or
be
taught
to
resign
himself
in
advance
for
the
struggle
in
which
humanity
is
engaged
and
in
which
to
defend
himself
and
to
keep
his
footing
he
ought
previously
to
have
been
equipped
armed
trained
and
hardened
this
indispensable
equipment
this
acquisition
of
more
importance
than
any
other
this
sturdy
common
sense
and
nerve
and
our
schools
do
not
procure
the
young
frenchman
on
the
contrary
far
from
qualifying
him
for
his
approaching
and
definite
state
they
disqualify
him
in
consequence
his
entry
into
the
world
and
his
first
steps
in
the
field
of
action
are
most
often
merely
a
succession
of
painful
falls
whose
effect
is
that
he
long
remains
wounded
and
bruised
and
sometimes
disabled
for
life
the
test
is
severe
and
dangerous
in
the
course
of
it
the
mental
and
moral
equilibrium
is
affected
and
runs
the
risk
of
not
being
too
sudden
and
complete
disillusion
has
supervened
the
deceptions
have
been
too
great
the
disappointments
too
keen
taine

these
pages
are
almost
the
last
that
taine
wrote
they
resume
admirably
the
results
of
the
great
philosopher
long
experience
unfortunately
they
are
in
my
opinion
totally
incomprehensible
for
such
of
our
university
professors
who
have
not
lived
abroad
education
is
the
only
means
at
our
disposal
of
influencing
to
some
extent
the
mind
of
a
nation
and
it
is
profoundly
saddening
to
have
to
think
that
there
is
scarcely
any
one
in
france
who
can
arrive
at
understanding
that
our
present
system
of
teaching
is
a
grave
cause
of
rapid
decadence
which
instead
of
elevating
our
youth
lowers
and
perverts
it
a
useful
comparison
may
be
made
between
taine
pages
and
the
observations
on
american
education
recently
made
by
paul
bourget
in
his
excellent
book
he
too
after
having
noted
that
our
education
merely
produces
bourgeois
lacking
in
initiative
and
or
anarchists
those
two
equally
harmful
types
of
the
civilised
man
who
degenerates
into
impotent
platitude
or
insane
destructiveness
he
too
i
say
draws
a
comparison
that
can
not
be
the
object
of
too
much
reflection
between
our
french
lycees
public
schools
those
factories
of
degeneration
and
the
american
schools
which
prepare
a
man
admirably
for
life
the
gulf
existing
between
truly
democratic
nations
and
those
who
have
democracy
in
their
speeches
but
in
no
wise
in
their
thoughts
is
clearly
brought
out
in
this
comparison
have
we
digressed
in
what
precedes
from
the
psychology
of
crowds
assuredly
not
if
we
desire
to
understand
the
ideas
and
beliefs
that
are
germinating
in
the
masses
and
will
spring
up
it
is
necessary
to
know
how
the
ground
has
been
prepared
the
instruction
given
the
youth
of
a
country
allows
of
a
knowledge
of
what
that
country
will
one
day
be
the
education
accorded
the
present
generation
justifies
the
most
gloomy
previsions
it
is
in
part
by
instruction
and
education
that
the
mind
of
the
masses
is
improved
or
deteriorated
it
was
necessary
in
consequence
to
show
how
this
mind
has
been
fashioned
by
the
system
in
vogue
and
how
the
mass
of
the
indifferent
and
the
neutral
has
become
progressively
an
army
of
the
discontented
ready
to
obey
all
the
suggestions
of
utopians
and
rhetoricians
it
is
in
the
schoolroom
that
socialists
and
anarchists
are
found
nowadays
and
that
the
way
is
being
paved
for
the
approaching
period
of

the
condition
that
it
be
frequently
repeated

cost
of
the

requisite
to
persuade

nullity
of
its

on

crowds
only
to
be
influenced
by
their
unconscious
sentiments
the
role
of
logic
in
history
the
secret
causes
of
improbable
events
we
have
just
investigated
the
remote
and
preparatory
factors
which
give
the
mind
of
crowds
a
special
receptivity
and
make
possible
therein
the
growth
of
certain
sentiments
and
certain
ideas
it
now
remains
for
us
to
study
the
factors
capable
of
acting
in
a
direct
manner
we
shall
see
in
a
forthcoming
chapter
how
these
factors
should
be
put
in
force
in
order
that
they
may
produce
their
full
effect
in
the
first
part
of
this
work
we
studied
the
sentiments
ideas
and
methods
of
reasoning
of
collective
bodies
and
from
the
knowledge
thus
acquired
it
would
evidently
be
possible
to
deduce
in
a
general
way
the
means
of
making
an
impression
on
their
mind
we
already
know
what
strikes
the
imagination
of
crowds
and
are
acquainted
with
the
power
and
contagiousness
of
suggestions
of
those
especially
that
are
presented
under
the
form
of
images
however
as
suggestions
may
proceed
from
very
different
sources
the
factors
capable
of
acting
on
the
minds
of
crowds
may
differ
considerably
it
is
necessary
then
to
study
them
separately
this
is
not
a
useless
study
crowds
are
somewhat
like
the
sphinx
of
ancient
fable
it
is
necessary
to
arrive
at
a
solution
of
the
problems
offered
by
their
psychology
or
to
resign
ourselves
to
being
devoured
by
them
images
words
and
formulas
when
studying
the
imagination
of
crowds
we
saw
that
it
is
particularly
open
to
the
impressions
produced
by
images
these
images
do
not
always
lie
ready
to
hand
but
it
is
possible
to
evoke
them
by
the
judicious
employment
of
words
and
formulas
handled
with
art
they
possess
in
sober
truth
the
mysterious
power
formerly
attributed
to
them
by
the
adepts
of
magic
they
cause
the
birth
in
the
minds
of
crowds
of
the
most
formidable
tempests
which
in
turn
they
are
capable
of
stilling
a
pyramid
far
loftier
than
that
of
old
cheops
could
be
raised
merely
with
the
bones
of
men
who
have
been
victims
of
the
power
of
words
and
formulas
the
power
of
words
is
bound
up
with
the
images
they
evoke
and
is
quite
independent
of
their
real
significance
words
whose
sense
is
the
most
are
sometimes
those
that
possess
the
most
influence
such
for
example
are
the
terms
democracy
socialism
equality
liberty
whose
meaning
is
so
vague
that
bulky
volumes
do
not
suffice
to
precisely
fix
it
yet
it
is
certain
that
a
truly
magical
power
is
attached
to
those
short
syllables
as
if
they
contained
the
solution
of
all
problems
they
synthesise
the
most
diverse
unconscious
aspirations
and
the
hope
of
their
realisation
reason
and
arguments
are
incapable
of
combatting
certain
words
and
formulas
they
are
uttered
with
solemnity
in
the
presence
of
crowds
and
as
soon
as
they
have
been
pronounced
an
expression
of
respect
is
visible
on
every
countenance
and
all
heads
are
bowed
by
many
they
are
considered
as
natural
forces
as
supernatural
powers
they
evoke
grandiose
and
vague
images
in
men
minds
but
this
very
vagueness
that
wraps
them
in
obscurity
augments
their
mysterious
power
they
are
the
mysterious
divinities
hidden
behind
the
tabernacle
which
the
devout
only
approach
in
fear
and
trembling
the
images
evoked
by
words
being
independent
of
their
sense
they
vary
from
age
to
age
and
from
people
to
people
the
formulas
remaining
identical
certain
transitory
images
are
attached
to
certain
words
the
word
is
merely
as
it
were
the
button
of
an
electric
bell
that
calls
them
up
all
words
and
all
formulas
do
not
possess
the
power
of
evoking
images
while
there
are
some
which
have
once
had
this
power
but
lose
it
in
the
course
of
use
and
cease
to
waken
any
response
in
the
mind
they
then
become
vain
sounds
whose
principal
utility
is
to
relieve
the
person
who
employs
them
of
the
obligation
of
thinking
armed
with
a
small
stock
of
formulas
and
commonplaces
learnt
while
we
are
young
we
possess
all
that
is
needed
to
traverse
life
without
the
tiring
necessity
of
having
to
reflect
on
anything
whatever
if
any
particular
language
be
studied
it
is
seen
that
the
words
of
which
it
is
composed
change
rather
slowly
in
the
course
of
ages
while
the
images
these
words
evoke
or
the
meaning
attached
to
them
changes
ceaselessly
this
is
the
reason
why
in
another
work
i
have
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
the
absolute
translation
of
a
language
especially
of
a
dead
language
is
totally
impossible
what
do
we
do
in
reality
when
we
substitute
a
french
for
a
latin
greek
or
sanscrit
expression
or
even
when
we
endeavour
to
understand
a
book
written
in
our
own
tongue
two
or
three
centuries
back
we
merely
put
the
images
and
ideas
with
which
modern
life
has
endowed
our
intelligence
in
the
place
of
absolutely
distinct
notions
and
images
which
ancient
life
had
brought
into
being
in
the
mind
of
races
submitted
to
conditions
of
existence
having
no
analogy
with
our
own
when
the
men
of
the
revolution
imagined
they
were
copying
the
greeks
and
romans
what
were
they
doing
except
giving
to
ancient
words
a
sense
the
latter
had
never
had
what
resemblance
can
possibly
exist
between
the
institutions
of
the
greeks
and
those
designated
by
corresponding
words
a
republic
at
that
epoch
was
an
essentially
aristocratic
institution
formed
of
a
reunion
of
petty
despots
ruling
over
a
crowd
of
slaves
kept
in
the
most
absolute
subjection
these
communal
aristocracies
based
on
slavery
could
not
have
existed
for
a
moment
without
it
the
word
liberty
again
what
signification
could
it
have
in
any
way
resembling
that
we
attribute
to
it
at
a
period
when
the
possibility
of
the
liberty
of
thought
was
not
even
suspected
and
when
there
was
no
greater
and
more
exceptional
crime
than
that
of
discussing
the
gods
the
laws
and
the
customs
of
the
city
what
did
such
a
word
as
fatherland
signify
to
an
athenian
or
spartan
unless
it
were
the
cult
of
athens
or
sparta
and
in
no
wise
that
of
greece
composed
of
rival
cities
always
at
war
with
each
other
what
meaning
had
the
same
word
fatherland
among
the
ancient
gauls
divided
into
rival
tribes
and
races
and
possessing
different
languages
and
religions
and
who
were
easily
vanquished
by
caesar
because
he
always
found
allies
among
them
it
was
rome
that
made
a
country
of
gaul
by
endowing
it
with
political
and
religious
unity
without
going
back
so
far
scarcely
two
centuries
ago
is
it
to
be
believed
that
this
same
notion
of
a
fatherland
was
conceived
to
have
the
same
meaning
as
at
present
by
french
princes
like
the
great
conde
who
allied
themselves
with
the
foreigner
against
their
sovereign
and
yet
again
the
same
word
had
it
not
a
sense
very
different
from
the
modern
for
the
french
royalist
emigrants
who
thought
they
obeyed
the
laws
of
honour
in
fighting
against
france
and
who
from
their
point
of
view
did
indeed
obey
them
since
the
feudal
law
bound
the
vassal
to
the
lord
and
not
to
the
soil
so
that
where
the
sovereign
was
there
was
the
true
fatherland
numerous
are
the
words
whose
meaning
has
thus
profoundly
changed
from
age
to
age
words
which
we
can
only
arrive
at
understanding
in
the
sense
in
which
they
were
formerly
understood
after
a
long
effort
it
has
been
said
with
truth
that
much
study
is
necessary
merely
to
arrive
at
conceiving
what
was
signified
to
our
great
grandfathers
by
such
words
as
the
king
and
the
royal
family
what
then
is
likely
to
be
the
case
with
terms
still
more
complex
words
then
have
only
mobile
and
transitory
significations
which
change
from
age
to
age
and
people
to
people
and
when
we
desire
to
exert
an
influence
by
their
means
on
the
crowd
what
it
is
requisite
to
know
is
the
meaning
given
them
by
the
crowd
at
a
given
moment
and
not
the
meaning
which
they
formerly
had
or
may
yet
have
for
individuals
of
a
different
mental
constitution
thus
when
crowds
have
come
as
the
result
of
political
upheavals
or
changes
of
belief
to
acquire
a
profound
antipathy
for
the
images
evoked
by
certain
words
the
first
duty
of
the
true
statesman
is
to
change
the
words
without
of
course
laying
hands
on
the
things
themselves
the
latter
being
too
intimately
bound
up
with
the
inherited
constitution
to
be
transformed
the
judicious
tocqueville
long
ago
made
the
remark
that
the
work
of
the
consulate
and
the
empire
consisted
more
particularly
in
the
clothing
with
new
words
of
the
greater
part
of
the
institutions
of
the
past
that
is
to
say
in
replacing
words
evoking
disagreeable
images
in
the
imagination
of
the
crowd
by
other
words
of
which
the
novelty
prevented
such
evocations
the
taille
or
tallage
has
become
the
land
tax
the
gabelle
the
tax
on
salt
the
aids
the
indirect
contributions
and
the
consolidated
duties
the
tax
on
trade
companies
and
guilds
the
license
one
of
the
most
essential
functions
of
statesmen
consists
then
in
baptizing
with
popular
or
at
any
rate
indifferent
words
things
the
crowd
can
not
endure
under
their
old
names
the
power
of
words
is
so
great
that
it
suffices
to
designate
in
terms
the
most
odious
things
to
make
them
acceptable
to
crowds
taine
justly
observes
that
it
was
by
invoking
liberty
and
fraternity
words
very
popular
at
the
time
that
the
jacobins
were
able
to
install
a
despotism
worthy
of
dahomey
a
tribunal
similar
to
that
of
the
inquisition
and
to
accomplish
human
hecatombs
akin
to
those
of
ancient
mexico
the
art
of
those
who
govern
as
is
the
case
with
the
art
of
advocates
consists
above
all
in
the
science
of
employing
words
one
of
the
greatest
difficulties
of
this
art
is
that
in
one
and
the
same
society
the
same
words
most
often
have
very
different
meanings
for
the
different
social
classes
who
employ
in
appearance
the
same
words
but
never
speak
the
same
language
in
the
preceding
examples
it
is
especially
time
that
has
been
made
to
intervene
as
the
principal
factor
in
the
changing
of
the
meaning
of
words
if
however
we
also
make
race
intervene
we
shall
then
see
that
at
the
same
period
among
peoples
equally
civilised
but
of
different
race
the
same
words
very
often
correspond
to
extremely
dissimilar
ideas
it
is
impossible
to
understand
these
differences
without
having
travelled
much
and
for
this
reason
i
shall
not
insist
upon
them
i
shall
confine
myself
to
observing
that
it
is
precisely
the
words
most
often
employed
by
the
masses
which
among
different
peoples
possess
the
most
different
meanings
such
is
the
case
for
instance
with
the
words
democracy
and
socialism
in
such
frequent
use
nowadays
in
reality
they
correspond
to
quite
contrary
ideas
and
images
in
the
latin
and
mind
for
the
latin
peoples
the
word
democracy
signifies
more
especially
the
subordination
of
the
will
and
the
initiative
of
the
individual
to
the
will
and
the
initiative
of
the
community
represented
by
the
state
it
is
the
state
that
is
charged
to
a
greater
and
greater
degree
with
the
direction
of
everything
the
centralisation
the
monopolisation
and
the
manufacture
of
everything
to
the
state
it
is
that
all
parties
without
exception
radicals
socialists
or
monarchists
constantly
appeal
among
the
and
notably
in
america
this
same
word
democracy
signifies
on
the
contrary
the
intense
development
of
the
will
of
the
individual
and
as
complete
a
subordination
as
possible
of
the
state
which
with
the
exception
of
the
police
the
army
and
diplomatic
relations
is
not
allowed
the
direction
of
anything
not
even
of
public
instruction
it
is
seen
then
that
the
same
word
which
signifies
for
one
people
the
subordination
of
the
will
and
the
initiative
of
the
individual
and
the
preponderance
of
the
state
signifies
for
another
the
excessive
development
of
the
will
and
the
initiative
of
the
individual
and
the
complete
subordination
of
the
state
in
my
book
the
psychological
laws
of
the
evolution
of
peoples
i
have
insisted
at
length
on
the
differences
which
distinguish
the
latin
democratic
ideal
from
the
democratic
ideal
independently
and
as
the
result
of
his
travels
paul
bourget
has
arrived
in
his
quite
recent
book
at
conclusions
almost
identical
with
mine
illusions
from
the
dawn
of
civilisation
onwards
crowds
have
always
undergone
the
influence
of
illusions
it
is
to
the
creators
of
illusions
that
they
have
raised
more
temples
statues
and
altars
than
to
any
other
class
of
men
whether
it
be
the
religious
illusions
of
the
past
or
the
philosophic
and
social
illusions
of
the
present
these
formidable
sovereign
powers
are
always
found
at
the
head
of
all
the
civilisations
that
have
successively
flourished
on
our
planet
it
is
in
their
name
that
were
built
the
temples
of
chaldea
and
egypt
and
the
religious
edifices
of
the
middle
ages
and
that
a
vast
upheaval
shook
the
whole
of
europe
a
century
ago
and
there
is
not
one
of
our
political
artistic
or
social
conceptions
that
is
free
from
their
powerful
impress
occasionally
at
the
cost
of
terrible
disturbances
man
overthrows
them
but
he
seems
condemned
to
always
set
them
up
again
without
them
he
would
never
have
emerged
from
his
primitive
barbarian
state
and
without
them
again
he
would
soon
return
to
it
doubtless
they
are
futile
shadows
but
these
children
of
our
dreams
have
forced
the
nations
to
create
whatever
the
arts
may
boast
of
splendour
or
civilisation
of
greatness
if
one
destroyed
in
museums
and
libraries
if
one
hurled
down
on
the
flagstones
before
the
churches
all
the
works
and
all
the
monuments
of
art
that
religions
have
inspired
what
would
remain
of
the
great
dreams
of
humanity
to
give
to
men
that
portion
of
hope
and
illusion
without
which
they
can
not
live
such
is
the
reason
for
the
existence
of
gods
heroes
and
poets
during
fifty
years
science
appeared
to
undertake
this
task
but
science
has
been
compromised
in
hearts
hungering
after
the
ideal
because
it
does
not
dare
to
be
lavish
enough
of
promises
because
it
can
not
lie
daniel
lesueur
the
philosophers
of
the
last
century
devoted
themselves
with
fervour
to
the
destruction
of
the
religious
political
and
social
illusions
on
which
our
forefathers
had
lived
for
a
long
tale
of
centuries
by
destroying
them
they
have
dried
up
the
springs
of
hope
and
resignation
behind
the
immolated
chimeras
they
came
face
to
face
with
the
blind
and
silent
forces
of
nature
which
are
inexorable
to
weakness
and
ignore
pity
notwithstanding
all
its
progress
philosophy
has
been
unable
as
yet
to
offer
the
masses
any
ideal
that
can
charm
them
but
as
they
must
have
their
illusions
at
all
cost
they
turn
instinctively
as
the
insect
seeks
the
light
to
the
rhetoricians
who
accord
them
what
they
want
not
truth
but
error
has
always
been
the
chief
factor
in
the
evolution
of
nations
and
the
reason
why
socialism
is
so
powerful
is
that
it
constitutes
the
last
illusion
that
is
still
vital
in
spite
of
all
scientific
demonstrations
it
continues
on
the
increase
its
principal
strength
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
is
championed
by
minds
sufficiently
ignorant
of
things
as
they
are
in
reality
to
venture
boldly
to
promise
mankind
happiness
the
social
illusion
reigns
upon
all
the
ruins
of
the
past
and
to
it
belongs
the
future
the
masses
have
never
thirsted
after
truth
they
turn
aside
from
evidence
that
is
not
to
their
taste
preferring
to
deify
error
if
error
seduce
them
whoever
can
supply
them
with
illusions
is
easily
their
master
whoever
attempts
to
destroy
their
illusions
is
always
their
victim
experience
experience
constitutes
almost
the
only
effective
process
by
which
a
truth
may
be
solidly
established
in
the
mind
of
the
masses
and
illusions
grown
too
dangerous
be
destroyed
to
this
end
however
it
is
necessary
that
the
experience
should
take
place
on
a
very
large
scale
and
be
very
frequently
repeated
the
experiences
undergone
by
one
generation
are
useless
as
a
rule
for
the
generation
that
follows
which
is
the
reason
why
historical
facts
cited
with
a
view
to
demonstration
serve
no
purpose
their
only
utility
is
to
prove
to
what
an
extent
experiences
need
to
be
repeated
from
age
to
age
to
exert
any
influence
or
to
be
successful
in
merely
shaking
an
erroneous
opinion
when
it
is
solidly
implanted
in
the
mind
of
the
masses
our
century
and
that
which
preceded
it
will
doubtless
be
alluded
to
by
historians
as
an
era
of
curious
experiments
which
in
no
other
age
have
been
tried
in
such
number
the
most
gigantic
of
these
experiments
was
the
french
revolution
to
find
out
that
a
society
is
not
to
be
refashioned
from
top
to
bottom
in
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
pure
reason
it
was
necessary
that
several
millions
of
men
should
be
massacred
and
that
europe
should
be
profoundly
disturbed
for
a
period
of
twenty
years
to
prove
to
us
experimentally
that
dictators
cost
the
nations
who
acclaim
them
dear
two
ruinous
experiences
have
been
required
in
fifty
years
and
in
spite
of
their
clearness
they
do
not
seem
to
have
been
sufficiently
convincing
the
first
nevertheless
cost
three
millions
of
men
and
an
invasion
the
second
involved
a
loss
of
territory
and
carried
in
its
wake
the
necessity
for
permanent
armies
a
third
was
almost
attempted
not
long
since
and
will
assuredly
be
attempted
one
day
to
bring
an
entire
nation
to
admit
that
the
huge
german
army
was
not
as
was
currently
alleged
thirty
years
ago
a
sort
of
harmless
national
guard
the
terrible
war
which
cost
us
so
dear
had
to
take
place
to
bring
about
the
recognition
that
protection
ruins
the
nations
who
adopt
it
at
least
twenty
years
of
disastrous
experience
will
be
needful
these
examples
might
be
indefinitely
multiplied
the
opinion
of
the
crowd
was
formed
in
this
case
by
those
associations
of
dissimilar
things
the
mechanism
of
which
i
have
previously
explained
the
french
national
guard
of
that
period
being
composed
of
peaceable
shopkeepers
utterly
lacking
in
discipline
and
quite
incapable
of
being
taken
seriously
whatever
bore
a
similar
name
evoked
the
same
conception
and
was
considered
in
consequence
as
harmless
the
error
of
the
crowd
was
shared
at
the
time
by
its
leaders
as
happens
so
often
in
connection
with
opinions
dealing
with
generalisations
in
a
speech
made
in
the
chamber
on
the
of
december
and
quoted
in
a
book
by
ollivier
that
has
appeared
recently
a
statesman
who
often
followed
the
opinion
of
the
crowd
but
was
never
in
advance
of
it
i
allude
to
thiers
declared
that
prussia
only
possessed
a
national
guard
analogous
to
that
of
france
and
in
consequence
without
importance
in
addition
to
a
regular
army
about
equal
to
the
french
regular
army
assertions
about
as
accurate
as
the
predictions
of
the
same
statesman
as
to
the
insignificant
future
reserved
for
railways
reason
in
enumerating
the
factors
capable
of
making
an
impression
on
the
minds
of
crowds
all
mention
of
reason
might
be
dispensed
with
were
it
not
necessary
to
point
out
the
negative
value
of
its
influence
we
have
already
shown
that
crowds
are
not
to
be
influenced
by
reasoning
and
can
only
comprehend
associations
of
ideas
the
orators
who
know
how
to
make
an
impression
upon
them
always
appeal
in
consequence
to
their
sentiments
and
never
to
their
reason
the
laws
of
logic
have
no
action
on
crowds
to
bring
home
conviction
to
crowds
it
is
necessary
first
of
all
to
thoroughly
comprehend
the
sentiments
by
which
they
are
animated
to
pretend
to
share
these
sentiments
then
to
endeavour
to
modify
them
by
calling
up
by
means
of
rudimentary
associations
certain
eminently
suggestive
notions
to
be
capable
if
need
be
of
going
back
to
the
point
of
view
from
which
a
start
was
made
and
above
all
to
divine
from
instant
to
instant
the
sentiments
to
which
one
discourse
is
giving
birth
this
necessity
of
ceaselessly
varying
one
language
in
accordance
with
the
effect
produced
at
the
moment
of
speaking
deprives
from
the
outset
a
prepared
and
studied
harangue
of
all
efficaciousness
in
such
a
speech
the
orator
follows
his
own
line
of
thought
not
that
of
his
hearers
and
from
this
fact
alone
his
influence
is
annihilated
my
first
observations
with
regard
to
the
art
of
impressing
crowds
and
touching
the
slight
assistance
to
be
derived
in
this
connection
from
the
rules
of
logic
date
back
to
the
seige
of
paris
to
the
day
when
i
saw
conducted
to
the
louvre
where
the
government
was
then
sitting
marshal
v
whom
a
furious
crowd
asserted
they
had
surprised
in
the
act
of
taking
the
plans
of
the
fortifications
to
sell
them
to
the
prussians
a
member
of
the
government
p
a
very
celebrated
orator
came
out
to
harangue
the
crowd
which
was
demanding
the
immediate
execution
of
the
prisoner
i
had
expected
that
the
speaker
would
point
out
the
absurdity
of
the
accusation
by
remarking
that
the
accused
marshal
was
positively
one
of
those
who
had
constructed
the
fortifications
the
plan
of
which
moreover
was
on
sale
at
every
booksellers
to
my
immense
stupefaction
i
was
very
young
then
the
speech
was
on
quite
different
lines
justice
shall
be
done
exclaimed
the
orator
advancing
towards
the
prisoner
and
pitiless
justice
let
the
government
of
the
national
defence
conclude
your
inquiry
in
the
meantime
we
will
keep
the
prisoner
in
custody
at
once
calmed
by
this
apparent
concession
the
crowd
broke
up
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
marshal
was
able
to
return
home
he
would
infallibly
have
been
torn
in
pieces
had
the
speaker
treated
the
infuriated
crowd
to
the
logical
arguments
that
my
extreme
youth
induced
me
to
consider
as
very
convincing
logical
minds
accustomed
to
be
convinced
by
a
chain
of
somewhat
close
reasoning
can
not
avoid
having
recourse
to
this
mode
of
persuasion
when
addressing
crowds
and
the
inability
of
their
arguments
always
surprises
them
the
usual
mathematical
consequences
based
on
the
syllogism
that
is
on
associations
of
identities
are
imperative
writes
a
logician
this
imperativeness
would
enforce
the
assent
even
of
an
inorganic
mass
were
it
capable
of
following
associations
of
identities
this
is
doubtless
true
but
a
crowd
is
no
more
capable
than
an
inorganic
mass
of
following
such
associations
nor
even
of
understanding
them
if
the
attempt
be
made
to
convince
by
reasoning
primitive
minds
savages
or
children
for
instance
the
slight
value
possessed
by
this
method
of
arguing
will
be
understood
it
is
not
even
necessary
to
descend
so
low
as
primitive
beings
to
obtain
an
insight
into
the
utter
powerlessness
of
reasoning
when
it
has
to
fight
against
sentiment
let
us
merely
call
to
mind
how
tenacious
for
centuries
long
have
been
religious
superstitions
in
contradiction
with
the
simplest
logic
for
nearly
two
thousand
years
the
most
luminous
geniuses
have
bowed
before
their
laws
and
modern
times
have
to
be
reached
for
their
veracity
to
be
merely
contested
the
middle
ages
and
the
renaissance
possessed
many
enlightened
men
but
not
a
single
man
who
attained
by
reasoning
to
an
appreciation
of
the
childish
side
of
his
superstitions
or
who
promulgated
even
a
slight
doubt
as
to
the
misdeeds
of
the
devil
or
the
necessity
of
burning
sorcerers
should
it
be
regretted
that
crowds
are
never
guided
by
reason
we
would
not
venture
to
affirm
it
without
a
doubt
human
reason
would
not
have
availed
to
spur
humanity
along
the
path
of
civilisation
with
the
ardour
and
hardihood
its
illusions
have
done
these
illusions
the
offspring
of
those
unconscious
forces
by
which
we
are
led
were
doubtless
necessary
every
race
carries
in
its
mental
constitution
the
laws
of
its
destiny
and
it
is
perhaps
these
laws
that
it
obeys
with
a
resistless
impulse
even
in
the
case
of
those
of
its
impulses
which
apparently
are
the
most
unreasoned
it
seems
at
times
as
if
nations
were
submitted
to
secret
forces
analogous
to
those
which
compel
the
acorn
to
transform
itself
into
an
oak
or
a
comet
to
follow
its
orbit
what
little
insight
we
can
get
into
these
forces
must
be
sought
for
in
the
general
course
of
the
evolution
of
a
people
and
not
in
the
isolated
facts
from
which
this
evolution
appears
at
times
to
proceed
were
these
facts
alone
to
be
taken
into
consideration
history
would
seem
to
be
the
result
of
a
series
of
improbable
chances
it
was
improbable
that
a
galilean
carpenter
should
become
for
two
thousand
years
an
god
in
whose
name
the
most
important
civilisations
were
founded
improbable
too
that
a
few
bands
of
arabs
emerging
from
their
deserts
should
conquer
the
greater
part
of
the
old
world
and
establish
an
empire
greater
than
that
of
alexander
improbable
again
that
in
europe
at
an
advanced
period
of
its
development
and
when
authority
throughout
it
had
been
systematically
hierarchised
an
obscure
lieutenant
of
artillery
should
have
succeeded
in
reigning
over
a
multitude
of
peoples
and
kings
let
us
leave
reason
then
to
philosophers
and
not
insist
too
strongly
on
its
intervention
in
the
governing
of
men
it
is
not
by
reason
but
most
often
in
spite
of
it
that
are
created
those
sentiments
that
are
the
mainsprings
of
all
civilisation
sentiments
such
as
honour
sacrifice
religious
faith
patriotism
and
the
love
of
glory

the

the

instinctive
need
of
all
beings
forming

obey

psychology

the

the
respective
part
of
these
different
factors
the
way
in
which
contagion
may
spread
from
the
lower
to
the
upper
classes
in
a
society
a
popular
opinion
soon
becomes
a
general
opinion
prestige
definition
of
prestige
and
classification
of
its
different
kinds
acquired
prestige
and
personal
prestige
various
examples
the
way
in
which
prestige
is
destroyed
we
are
now
acquainted
with
the
mental
constitution
of
crowds
and
we
also
know
what
are
the
motives
capable
of
making
an
impression
on
their
mind
it
remains
to
investigate
how
these
motives
may
be
set
in
action
and
by
whom
they
may
usefully
be
turned
to
practical
account
the
leaders
of
crowds
as
soon
as
a
certain
number
of
living
beings
are
gathered
together
whether
they
be
animals
or
men
they
place
themselves
instinctively
under
the
authority
of
a
chief
in
the
case
of
human
crowds
the
chief
is
often
nothing
more
than
a
ringleader
or
agitator
but
as
such
he
plays
a
considerable
part
his
will
is
the
nucleus
around
which
the
opinions
of
the
crowd
are
grouped
and
attain
to
identity
he
constitutes
the
first
element
towards
the
organisation
of
heterogeneous
crowds
and
paves
the
way
for
their
organisation
in
sects
in
the
meantime
he
directs
them
a
crowd
is
a
servile
flock
that
is
incapable
of
ever
doing
without
a
master
the
leader
has
most
often
started
as
one
of
the
led
he
has
himself
been
hypnotised
by
the
idea
whose
apostle
he
has
since
become
it
has
taken
possession
of
him
to
such
a
degree
that
everything
outside
it
vanishes
and
that
every
contrary
opinion
appears
to
him
an
error
or
a
superstition
an
example
in
point
is
robespierre
hypnotised
by
the
philosophical
ideas
of
rousseau
and
employing
the
methods
of
the
inquisition
to
propagate
them
the
leaders
we
speak
of
are
more
frequently
men
of
action
than
thinkers
they
are
not
gifted
with
keen
foresight
nor
could
they
be
as
this
quality
generally
conduces
to
doubt
and
inactivity
they
are
especially
recruited
from
the
ranks
of
those
morbidly
nervous
excitable
persons
who
are
bordering
on
madness
however
absurd
may
be
the
idea
they
uphold
or
the
goal
they
pursue
their
convictions
are
so
strong
that
all
reasoning
is
lost
upon
them
contempt
and
persecution
do
not
affect
them
or
only
serve
to
excite
them
the
more
they
sacrifice
their
personal
interest
their
family
everything
the
very
instinct
of
is
entirely
obliterated
in
them
and
so
much
so
that
often
the
only
recompense
they
solicit
is
that
of
martyrdom
the
intensity
of
their
faith
gives
great
power
of
suggestion
to
their
words
the
multitude
is
always
ready
to
listen
to
the
man
who
knows
how
to
impose
himself
upon
it
men
gathered
in
a
crowd
lose
all
force
of
will
and
turn
instinctively
to
the
person
who
possesses
the
quality
they
lack
nations
have
never
lacked
leaders
but
all
of
the
latter
have
by
no
means
been
animated
by
those
strong
convictions
proper
to
apostles
these
leaders
are
often
subtle
rhetoricians
seeking
only
their
own
personal
interest
and
endeavouring
to
persuade
by
flattering
base
instincts
the
influence
they
can
assert
in
this
manner
may
be
very
great
but
it
is
always
ephemeral
the
men
of
ardent
convictions
who
have
stirred
the
soul
of
crowds
the
peter
the
hermits
the
luthers
the
savonarolas
the
men
of
the
french
revolution
have
only
exercised
their
fascination
after
having
been
themselves
fascinated
first
of
all
by
a
creed
they
are
then
able
to
call
up
in
the
souls
of
their
fellows
that
formidable
force
known
as
faith
which
renders
a
man
the
absolute
slave
of
his
dream
the
arousing
of
faith
whether
religious
political
or
social
whether
faith
in
a
work
in
a
person
or
an
idea
has
always
been
the
function
of
the
great
leaders
of
crowds
and
it
is
on
this
account
that
their
influence
is
always
very
great
of
all
the
forces
at
the
disposal
of
humanity
faith
has
always
been
one
of
the
most
tremendous
and
the
gospel
rightly
attributes
to
it
the
power
of
moving
mountains
to
endow
a
man
with
faith
is
to
multiply
his
strength
tenfold
the
great
events
of
history
have
been
brought
about
by
obscure
believers
who
have
had
little
beyond
their
faith
in
their
favour
it
is
not
by
the
aid
of
the
learned
or
of
philosophers
and
still
less
of
sceptics
that
have
been
built
up
the
great
religions
which
have
swayed
the
world
or
the
vast
empires
which
have
spread
from
one
hemisphere
to
the
other
in
the
cases
just
cited
however
we
are
dealing
with
great
leaders
and
they
are
so
few
in
number
that
history
can
easily
reckon
them
up
they
form
the
summit
of
a
continuous
series
which
extends
from
these
powerful
masters
of
men
down
to
the
workman
who
in
the
smoky
atmosphere
of
an
inn
slowly
fascinates
his
comrades
by
ceaselessly
drumming
into
their
ears
a
few
set
phrases
whose
purport
he
scarcely
comprehends
but
the
application
of
which
according
to
him
must
surely
bring
about
the
realisation
of
all
dreams
and
of
every
hope
in
every
social
sphere
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
as
soon
as
a
man
ceases
to
be
isolated
he
speedily
falls
under
the
influence
of
a
leader
the
majority
of
men
especially
among
the
masses
do
not
possess
clear
and
reasoned
ideas
on
any
subject
whatever
outside
their
own
speciality
the
leader
serves
them
as
guide
it
is
just
possible
that
he
may
be
replaced
though
very
inefficiently
by
the
periodical
publications
which
manufacture
opinions
for
their
readers
and
supply
them
with
made
phrases
which
dispense
them
of
the
trouble
of
reasoning
the
leaders
of
crowds
wield
a
very
despotic
authority
and
this
despotism
indeed
is
a
condition
of
their
obtaining
a
following
it
has
often
been
remarked
how
easily
they
extort
obedience
although
without
any
means
of
backing
up
their
authority
from
the
most
turbulent
section
of
the
working
classes
they
fix
the
hours
of
labour
and
the
rate
of
wages
and
they
decree
strikes
which
are
begun
and
ended
at
the
hour
they
ordain
at
the
present
day
these
leaders
and
agitators
tend
more
and
more
to
usurp
the
place
of
the
public
authorities
in
proportion
as
the
latter
allow
themselves
to
be
called
in
question
and
shorn
of
their
strength
the
tyranny
of
these
new
masters
has
for
result
that
the
crowds
obey
them
much
more
docilely
than
they
have
obeyed
any
government
if
in
consequence
of
some
accident
or
other
the
leaders
should
be
removed
from
the
scene
the
crowd
returns
to
its
original
state
of
a
collectivity
without
cohesion
or
force
of
resistance
during
the
last
strike
of
the
parisian
omnibus
employes
the
arrest
of
the
two
leaders
who
were
directing
it
was
at
once
sufficient
to
bring
it
to
an
end
it
is
the
need
not
of
liberty
but
of
servitude
that
is
always
predominant
in
the
soul
of
crowds
they
are
so
bent
on
obedience
that
they
instinctively
submit
to
whoever
declares
himself
their
master
these
ringleaders
and
agitators
may
be
divided
into
two
clearly
defined
classes
the
one
includes
the
men
who
are
energetic
and
possess
but
only
intermittently
much
strength
of
will
the
other
the
men
far
rarer
than
the
preceding
whose
strength
of
will
is
enduring
the
first
mentioned
are
violent
brave
and
audacious
they
are
more
especially
useful
to
direct
a
violent
enterprise
suddenly
decided
on
to
carry
the
masses
with
them
in
spite
of
danger
and
to
transform
into
heroes
the
men
who
but
yesterday
were
recruits
men
of
this
kind
were
ney
and
murat
under
the
first
empire
and
such
a
man
in
our
own
time
was
garibaldi
a
talentless
but
energetic
adventurer
who
succeeded
with
a
handful
of
men
in
laying
hands
on
the
ancient
kingdom
of
naples
defended
though
it
was
by
a
disciplined
army
still
though
the
energy
of
leaders
of
this
class
is
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
it
is
transitory
and
scarcely
outlasts
the
exciting
cause
that
has
brought
it
into
play
when
they
have
returned
to
their
ordinary
course
of
life
the
heroes
animated
by
energy
of
this
description
often
evince
as
was
the
case
with
those
i
have
just
cited
the
most
astonishing
weakness
of
character
they
seem
incapable
of
reflection
and
of
conducting
themselves
under
the
simplest
circumstances
although
they
had
been
able
to
lead
others
these
men
are
leaders
who
can
not
exercise
their
function
except
on
the
condition
that
they
be
led
themselves
and
continually
stimulated
that
they
have
always
as
their
beacon
a
man
or
an
idea
that
they
follow
a
line
of
conduct
clearly
traced
the
second
category
of
leaders
that
of
men
of
enduring
strength
of
will
have
in
spite
of
a
less
brilliant
aspect
a
much
more
considerable
influence
in
this
category
are
to
be
found
the
true
founders
of
religions
and
great
undertakings
paul
mahomet
christopher
columbus
and
de
lesseps
for
example
whether
they
be
intelligent
or
is
of
no
importance
the
world
belongs
to
them
the
persistent
they
possess
is
an
immensely
rare
and
immensely
powerful
faculty
to
which
everything
yields
what
a
strong
and
continuous
will
is
capable
of
is
not
always
properly
appreciated
nothing
resists
it
neither
nature
gods
nor
man
the
most
recent
example
of
what
can
be
effected
by
a
strong
and
continuous
will
is
afforded
us
by
the
illustrious
man
who
separated
the
eastern
and
western
worlds
and
accomplished
a
task
that
during
three
thousand
years
had
been
attempted
in
vain
by
the
greatest
sovereigns
he
failed
later
in
an
identical
enterprise
but
then
had
intervened
old
age
to
which
everything
even
the
will
succumbs
when
it
is
desired
to
show
what
may
be
done
by
mere
strength
of
will
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
relate
in
detail
the
history
of
the
difficulties
that
had
to
be
surmounted
in
connection
with
the
cutting
of
the
suez
canal
an
ocular
witness
cazalis
has
summed
up
in
a
few
striking
lines
the
entire
story
of
this
great
work
recounted
by
its
immortal
author
from
day
to
day
episode
by
episode
he
told
the
stupendous
story
of
the
canal
he
told
of
all
he
had
had
to
vanquish
of
the
impossible
he
had
made
possible
of
all
the
opposition
he
encountered
of
the
coalition
against
him
and
the
disappointments
the
reverses
the
defeats
which
had
been
unavailing
to
discourage
or
depress
him
he
recalled
how
england
had
combatted
him
attacking
him
without
cessation
how
egypt
and
france
had
hesitated
how
the
french
consul
had
been
foremost
in
his
opposition
to
the
early
stages
of
the
work
and
the
nature
of
the
opposition
he
had
met
with
the
attempt
to
force
his
workmen
to
desert
from
thirst
by
refusing
them
fresh
water
how
the
minister
of
marine
and
the
engineers
all
responsible
men
of
experienced
and
scientific
training
had
naturally
all
been
hostile
were
all
certain
on
scientific
grounds
that
disaster
was
at
hand
had
calculated
its
coming
foretelling
it
for
such
a
day
and
hour
as
an
eclipse
is
foretold
the
book
which
relates
the
lives
of
all
these
great
leaders
would
not
contain
many
names
but
these
names
have
been
bound
up
with
the
most
important
events
in
the
history
of
civilisation
the
means
of
action
of
the
leaders
affirmation
repetition
contagion
when
it
is
wanted
to
stir
up
a
crowd
for
a
short
space
of
time
to
induce
it
to
commit
an
act
of
any
nature
to
pillage
a
palace
or
to
die
in
defence
of
a
stronghold
or
a
barricade
for
instance
the
crowd
must
be
acted
upon
by
rapid
suggestion
among
which
example
is
the
most
powerful
in
its
effect
to
attain
this
end
however
it
is
necessary
that
the
crowd
should
have
been
previously
prepared
by
certain
circumstances
and
above
all
that
he
who
wishes
to
work
upon
it
should
possess
the
quality
to
be
studied
farther
on
to
which
i
give
the
name
of
prestige
when
however
it
is
proposed
to
imbue
the
mind
of
a
crowd
with
ideas
and
beliefs
with
modern
social
theories
for
instance
the
leaders
have
recourse
to
different
expedients
the
principal
of
them
are
three
in
number
and
clearly
defined
affirmation
repetition
and
contagion
their
action
is
somewhat
slow
but
its
effects
once
produced
are
very
lasting
affirmation
pure
and
simple
kept
free
of
all
reasoning
and
all
proof
is
one
of
the
surest
means
of
making
an
idea
enter
the
mind
of
crowds
the
conciser
an
affirmation
is
the
more
destitute
of
every
appearance
of
proof
and
demonstration
the
more
weight
it
carries
the
religious
books
and
the
legal
codes
of
all
ages
have
always
resorted
to
simple
affirmation
statesmen
called
upon
to
defend
a
political
cause
and
commercial
men
pushing
the
sale
of
their
products
by
means
of
advertising
are
acquainted
with
the
value
of
affirmation
affirmation
however
has
no
real
influence
unless
it
be
constantly
repeated
and
so
far
as
possible
in
the
same
terms
it
was
napoleon
i
believe
who
said
that
there
is
only
one
figure
in
rhetoric
of
serious
importance
namely
repetition
the
thing
affirmed
comes
by
repetition
to
fix
itself
in
the
mind
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
accepted
in
the
end
as
a
demonstrated
truth
the
influence
of
repetition
on
crowds
is
comprehensible
when
the
power
is
seen
which
it
exercises
on
the
most
enlightened
minds
this
power
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
repeated
statement
is
embedded
in
the
long
run
in
those
profound
regions
of
our
unconscious
selves
in
which
the
motives
of
our
actions
are
forged
at
the
end
of
a
certain
time
we
have
forgotten
who
is
the
author
of
the
repeated
assertion
and
we
finish
by
believing
it
to
this
circumstance
is
due
the
astonishing
power
of
advertisements
when
we
have
read
a
hundred
a
thousand
times
that
x
chocolate
is
the
best
we
imagine
we
have
heard
it
said
in
many
quarters
and
we
end
by
acquiring
the
certitude
that
such
is
the
fact
when
we
have
read
a
thousand
times
that
y
flour
has
cured
the
most
illustrious
persons
of
the
most
obstinate
maladies
we
are
tempted
at
last
to
try
it
when
suffering
from
an
illness
of
a
similar
kind
if
we
always
read
in
the
same
papers
that
a
is
an
arrant
scamp
and
b
a
most
honest
man
we
finish
by
being
convinced
that
this
is
the
truth
unless
indeed
we
are
given
to
reading
another
paper
of
the
contrary
opinion
in
which
the
two
qualifications
are
reversed
affirmation
and
repetition
are
alone
powerful
enough
to
combat
each
other
when
an
affirmation
has
been
sufficiently
repeated
and
there
is
unanimity
in
this
repetition
as
has
occurred
in
the
case
of
certain
famous
financial
undertakings
rich
enough
to
purchase
every
assistance
what
is
called
a
current
of
opinion
is
formed
and
the
powerful
mechanism
of
contagion
intervenes
ideas
sentiments
emotions
and
beliefs
possess
in
crowds
a
contagious
power
as
intense
as
that
of
microbes
this
phenomenon
is
very
natural
since
it
is
observed
even
in
animals
when
they
are
together
in
number
should
a
horse
in
a
stable
take
to
biting
his
manger
the
other
horses
in
the
stable
will
imitate
him
a
panic
that
has
seized
on
a
few
sheep
will
soon
extend
to
the
whole
flock
in
the
case
of
men
collected
in
a
crowd
all
emotions
are
very
rapidly
contagious
which
explains
the
suddenness
of
panics
brain
disorders
like
madness
are
themselves
contagious
the
frequency
of
madness
among
doctors
who
are
specialists
for
the
mad
is
notorious
indeed
forms
of
madness
have
recently
been
cited
agoraphobia
for
instance
which
are
communicable
from
men
to
animals
for
individuals
to
succumb
to
contagion
their
simultaneous
presence
on
the
same
spot
is
not
indispensable
the
action
of
contagion
may
be
felt
from
a
distance
under
the
influence
of
events
which
give
all
minds
an
individual
trend
and
the
characteristics
peculiar
to
crowds
this
is
especially
the
case
when
men
minds
have
been
prepared
to
undergo
the
influence
in
question
by
those
remote
factors
of
which
i
have
made
a
study
above
an
example
in
point
is
the
revolutionary
movement
of
which
after
breaking
out
in
paris
spread
rapidly
over
a
great
part
of
europe
and
shook
a
number
of
thrones
imitation
to
which
so
much
influence
is
attributed
in
social
phenomena
is
in
reality
a
mere
effect
of
contagion
having
shown
its
influence
elsewhere
i
shall
confine
myself
to
reproducing
what
i
said
on
the
subject
fifteen
years
ago
my
remarks
have
since
been
developed
by
other
writers
in
recent
publications
man
like
animals
has
a
natural
tendency
to
imitation
imitation
is
a
necessity
for
him
provided
always
that
the
imitation
is
quite
easy
it
is
this
necessity
that
makes
the
influence
of
what
is
called
fashion
so
powerful
whether
in
the
matter
of
opinions
ideas
literary
manifestations
or
merely
of
dress
how
many
persons
are
bold
enough
to
run
counter
to
the
fashion
it
is
by
examples
not
by
arguments
that
crowds
are
guided
at
every
period
there
exists
a
small
number
of
individualities
which
react
upon
the
remainder
and
are
imitated
by
the
unconscious
mass
it
is
needful
however
that
these
individualities
should
not
be
in
too
pronounced
disagreement
with
received
ideas
were
they
so
to
imitate
them
would
be
too
difficult
and
their
influence
would
be
nil
for
this
very
reason
men
who
are
too
superior
to
their
epoch
are
generally
without
influence
upon
it
the
line
of
separation
is
too
strongly
marked
for
the
same
reason
too
europeans
in
spite
of
all
the
advantages
of
their
civilisation
have
so
insignificant
an
influence
on
eastern
people
they
differ
from
them
to
too
great
an
extent
the
dual
action
of
the
past
and
of
reciprocal
imitation
renders
in
the
long
run
all
the
men
of
the
same
country
and
the
same
period
so
alike
that
even
in
the
case
of
individuals
who
would
seem
destined
to
escape
this
double
influence
such
as
philosophers
learned
men
and
men
of
letters
thought
and
style
have
a
family
air
which
enables
the
age
to
which
they
belong
to
be
immediately
recognised
it
is
not
necessary
to
talk
for
long
with
an
individual
to
attain
to
a
thorough
knowledge
of
what
he
reads
of
his
habitual
occupations
and
of
the
surroundings
amid
which
he
lives

contagion
is
so
powerful
that
it
forces
upon
individuals
not
only
certain
opinions
but
certain
modes
of
feeling
as
well
contagion
is
the
cause
of
the
contempt
in
which
at
a
given
period
certain
works
are
held
the
example
of
tannhauser
may
be
cited
which
a
few
years
later
for
the
same
reason
are
admired
by
those
who
were
foremost
in
criticising
them
the
opinions
and
beliefs
of
crowds
are
specially
propagated
by
contagion
but
never
by
reasoning
the
conceptions
at
present
rife
among
the
working
classes
have
been
acquired
at
the
as
the
result
of
affirmation
repetition
and
contagion
and
indeed
the
mode
of
creation
of
the
beliefs
of
crowds
of
every
age
has
scarcely
been
different
renan
justly
institutes
a
comparison
between
the
first
founders
of
christianity
and
the
socialist
working
men
spreading
their
ideas
from
to
while
voltaire
had
already
observed
in
connection
with
the
christian
religion
that
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
it
was
only
embraced
by
the
vilest
it
will
be
noted
that
in
cases
analogous
to
those
i
have
just
cited
contagion
after
having
been
at
work
among
the
popular
classes
has
spread
to
the
higher
classes
of
society
this
is
what
we
see
happening
at
the
present
day
with
regard
to
the
socialist
doctrines
which
are
beginning
to
be
held
by
those
who
will
yet
be
their
first
victims
contagion
is
so
powerful
a
force
that
even
the
sentiment
of
personal
interest
disappears
under
its
action
this
is
the
explanation
of
the
fact
that
every
opinion
adopted
by
the
populace
always
ends
in
implanting
itself
with
great
vigour
in
the
highest
social
strata
however
obvious
be
the
absurdity
of
the
triumphant
opinion
this
reaction
of
the
lower
upon
the
higher
social
classes
is
the
more
curious
owing
to
the
circumstance
that
the
beliefs
of
the
crowd
always
have
their
origin
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
in
some
higher
idea
which
has
often
remained
without
influence
in
the
sphere
in
which
it
was
evolved
leaders
and
agitators
subjugated
by
this
higher
idea
take
hold
of
it
distort
it
and
create
a
sect
which
distorts
it
afresh
and
then
propagates
it
amongst
the
masses
who
carry
the
process
of
deformation
still
further
become
a
popular
truth
the
idea
returns
as
it
were
to
its
source
and
exerts
an
influence
on
the
upper
classes
of
a
nation
in
the
long
run
it
is
intelligence
that
shapes
the
destiny
of
the
world
but
very
indirectly
the
philosophers
who
evolve
ideas
have
long
since
returned
to
dust
when
as
the
result
of
the
process
i
have
just
described
the
fruit
of
their
reflection
ends
by
triumphing
prestige
great
power
is
given
to
ideas
propagated
by
affirmation
repetition
and
contagion
by
the
circumstance
that
they
acquire
in
time
that
mysterious
force
known
as
prestige
whatever
has
been
a
ruling
power
in
the
world
whether
it
be
ideas
or
men
has
in
the
main
enforced
its
authority
by
means
of
that
irresistible
force
expressed
by
the
word
prestige
the
term
is
one
whose
meaning
is
grasped
by
everybody
but
the
word
is
employed
in
ways
too
different
for
it
to
be
easy
to
define
it
prestige
may
involve
such
sentiments
as
admiration
or
fear
occasionally
even
these
sentiments
are
its
basis
but
it
can
perfectly
well
exist
without
them
the
greatest
measure
of
prestige
is
possessed
by
the
dead
by
beings
that
is
of
whom
we
do
not
stand
in
fear
by
alexander
caesar
mahomet
and
buddha
for
example
on
the
other
hand
there
are
fictive
beings
whom
we
do
not
admire
the
monstrous
divinities
of
the
subterranean
temples
of
india
for
instance
but
who
strike
us
nevertheless
as
endowed
with
a
great
prestige
prestige
in
reality
is
a
sort
of
domination
exercised
on
our
mind
by
an
individual
a
work
or
an
idea
this
domination
entirely
paralyses
our
critical
faculty
and
fills
our
soul
with
astonishment
and
respect
the
sentiment
provoked
is
inexplicable
like
all
sentiments
but
it
would
appear
to
be
of
the
same
kind
as
the
fascination
to
which
a
magnetised
person
is
subjected
prestige
is
the
mainspring
of
all
authority
neither
gods
kings
nor
women
have
ever
reigned
without
it
the
various
kinds
of
prestige
may
be
grouped
under
two
principal
heads
acquired
prestige
and
personal
prestige
acquired
prestige
is
that
resulting
from
name
fortune
and
reputation
it
may
be
independent
of
personal
prestige
personal
prestige
on
the
contrary
is
something
essentially
peculiar
to
the
individual
it
may
coexist
with
reputation
glory
and
fortune
or
be
strengthened
by
them
but
it
is
perfectly
capable
of
existing
in
their
absence
acquired
or
artificial
prestige
is
much
the
most
common
the
mere
fact
that
an
individual
occupies
a
certain
position
possesses
a
certain
fortune
or
bears
certain
titles
endows
him
with
prestige
however
slight
his
own
personal
worth
a
soldier
in
uniform
a
judge
in
his
robes
always
enjoys
prestige
pascal
has
very
properly
noted
the
necessity
for
judges
of
robes
and
wigs
without
them
they
would
be
stripped
of
half
their
authority
the
most
unbending
socialist
is
always
somewhat
impressed
by
the
sight
of
a
prince
or
a
marquis
and
the
assumption
of
such
titles
makes
the
robbing
of
tradesmen
an
easy
matter
the
influence
of
titles
decorations
and
uniforms
on
crowds
is
to
be
traced
in
all
countries
even
in
those
in
which
the
sentiment
of
personal
independence
is
the
most
strongly
developed
i
quote
in
this
connection
a
curious
passage
from
a
recent
book
of
travel
on
the
prestige
enjoyed
in
england
by
great
persons
i
had
observed
under
various
circumstances
the
peculiar
sort
of
intoxication
produced
in
the
most
reasonable
englishmen
by
the
contact
or
sight
of
an
english
peer
provided
his
fortune
enables
him
to
keep
up
his
rank
he
is
sure
of
their
affection
in
advance
and
brought
into
contact
with
him
they
are
so
enchanted
as
to
put
up
with
anything
at
his
hands
they
may
be
seen
to
redden
with
pleasure
at
his
approach
and
if
he
speaks
to
them
their
suppressed
joy
increases
their
redness
and
causes
their
eyes
to
gleam
with
unusual
brilliance
respect
for
nobility
is
in
their
blood
so
to
speak
as
with
spaniards
the
love
of
dancing
with
germans
that
of
music
and
with
frenchmen
the
liking
for
revolutions
their
passion
for
horses
and
shakespeare
is
less
violent
the
satisfaction
and
pride
they
derive
from
these
sources
a
less
integral
part
of
their
being
there
is
a
considerable
sale
for
books
dealing
with
the
peerage
and
go
where
one
will
they
are
to
be
found
like
the
bible
in
all
hands
the
prestige
of
which
i
have
just
spoken
is
exercised
by
persons
side
by
side
with
it
may
be
placed
that
exercised
by
opinions
literary
and
artistic
works
prestige
of
the
latter
kind
is
most
often
merely
the
result
of
accumulated
repetitions
history
literary
and
artistic
history
especially
being
nothing
more
than
the
repetition
of
identical
judgments
which
nobody
endeavours
to
verify
every
one
ends
by
repeating
what
he
learnt
at
school
till
there
come
to
be
names
and
things
which
nobody
would
venture
to
meddle
with
for
a
modern
reader
the
perusal
of
homer
results
incontestably
in
immense
boredom
but
who
would
venture
to
say
so
the
parthenon
in
its
present
state
is
a
wretched
ruin
utterly
destitute
of
interest
but
it
is
endowed
with
such
prestige
that
it
does
not
appear
to
us
as
it
really
is
but
with
all
its
accompaniment
of
historic
memories
the
special
characteristic
of
prestige
is
to
prevent
us
seeing
things
as
they
are
and
to
entirely
paralyse
our
judgment
crowds
always
and
individuals
as
a
rule
stand
in
need
of
opinions
on
all
subjects
the
popularity
of
these
opinions
is
independent
of
the
measure
of
truth
or
error
they
contain
and
is
solely
regulated
by
their
prestige
i
now
come
to
personal
prestige
its
nature
is
very
different
from
that
of
artificial
or
acquired
prestige
with
which
i
have
just
been
concerned
it
is
a
faculty
independent
of
all
titles
of
all
authority
and
possessed
by
a
small
number
of
persons
whom
it
enables
to
exercise
a
veritably
magnetic
fascination
on
those
around
them
although
they
are
socially
their
equals
and
lack
all
ordinary
means
of
domination
they
force
the
acceptance
of
their
ideas
and
sentiments
on
those
about
them
and
they
are
obeyed
as
is
the
tamer
of
wild
beasts
by
the
animal
that
could
easily
devour
him
the
great
leaders
of
crowds
such
as
buddha
jesus
mahomet
joan
of
arc
and
napoleon
have
possessed
this
form
of
prestige
in
a
high
degree
and
to
this
endowment
is
more
particularly
due
the
position
they
attained
gods
heroes
and
dogmas
win
their
way
in
the
world
of
their
own
inward
strength
they
are
not
to
be
discussed
they
disappear
indeed
as
soon
as
discussed
the
great
personages
i
have
just
cited
were
in
possession
of
their
power
of
fascination
long
before
they
became
illustrious
and
would
never
have
become
so
without
it
it
is
evident
for
instance
that
napoleon
at
the
zenith
of
his
glory
enjoyed
an
immense
prestige
by
the
mere
fact
of
his
power
but
he
was
already
endowed
in
part
with
this
prestige
when
he
was
without
power
and
completely
unknown
when
an
obscure
general
he
was
sent
thanks
to
influential
protection
to
command
the
army
of
italy
he
found
himself
among
rough
generals
who
were
of
a
mind
to
give
a
hostile
reception
to
the
young
intruder
dispatched
them
by
the
directory
from
the
very
beginning
from
the
first
interview
without
the
aid
of
speeches
gestures
or
threats
at
the
first
sight
of
the
man
who
was
to
become
great
they
were
vanquished
taine
furnishes
a
curious
account
of
this
interview
taken
from
contemporary
memoirs
the
generals
of
division
amongst
others
augereau
a
sort
of
swashbuckler
uncouth
and
heroic
proud
of
his
height
and
his
bravery
arrive
at
the
staff
quarters
very
badly
disposed
towards
the
little
upstart
dispatched
them
from
paris
on
the
strength
of
the
description
of
him
that
has
been
given
them
augereau
is
inclined
to
be
insolent
and
insubordinate
a
favourite
of
barras
a
general
who
owes
his
rank
to
the
events
of
vendemiaire
who
has
won
his
grade
by
who
is
looked
upon
as
bearish
because
he
is
always
thinking
in
solitude
of
poor
aspect
and
with
the
reputation
of
a
mathematician
and
dreamer
they
are
introduced
and
bonaparte
keeps
them
waiting
at
last
he
appears
girt
with
his
sword
he
puts
on
his
hat
explains
the
measures
he
has
taken
gives
his
orders
and
dismisses
them
augereau
has
remained
silent
it
is
only
when
he
is
outside
that
he
regains
his
and
is
able
to
deliver
himself
of
his
customary
oaths
he
admits
with
massena
that
this
little
devil
of
a
general
has
inspired
him
with
awe
he
can
not
understand
the
ascendency
by
which
from
the
very
first
he
has
felt
himself
overwhelmed
become
a
great
man
his
prestige
increased
in
proportion
as
his
glory
grew
and
came
to
be
at
least
equal
to
that
of
a
divinity
in
the
eyes
of
those
devoted
to
him
general
vandamme
a
rough
typical
soldier
of
the
revolution
even
more
brutal
and
energetic
than
augereau
said
of
him
to
marshal
in
as
on
one
occasion
they
mounted
together
the
stairs
of
the
tuileries
that
devil
of
a
man
exercises
a
fascination
on
me
that
i
can
not
explain
even
to
myself
and
in
such
a
degree
that
though
i
fear
neither
god
nor
devil
when
i
am
in
his
presence
i
am
ready
to
tremble
like
a
child
and
he
could
make
me
go
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
to
throw
myself
into
the
fire
napoleon
exercised
a
like
fascination
on
all
who
came
into
contact
with
him
thoroughly
conscious
of
his
prestige
napoleon
was
aware
that
he
added
to
it
by
treating
rather
worse
than
stable
lads
the
great
personages
around
him
and
among
whom
figured
some
of
those
celebrated
men
of
the
convention
of
whom
europe
had
stood
in
dread
the
gossip
of
the
period
abounds
in
illustrations
of
this
fact
one
day
in
the
midst
of
a
council
of
state
napoleon

such

give
a
clear
idea
of
the
degree
of
base

that
prestige
can
provoke
they
enable
us
to
understand
the
immense
contempt
of
the

for
the

surrounding

he

i
for

have

it
is
necessary
to
bear
in
mind
the
astounding
power
exerted
by
fascination
of
this
order
to
understand
that
marvellous
return
from
the
isle
of
elba
that
conquest
of
france
by
an
isolated
man
confronted
by
all
the
organised
forces
of
a
great
country
that
might
have
been
supposed
weary
of
his
tyranny
he
had
merely
to
cast
a
look
at
the
generals
sent
to
lay
hands
on
him
and
who
had
sworn
to
accomplish
their
mission
all
of
them
submitted
without
discussion

in

almost
alone
a
fugitive
from
the
small
island
of
elba
which
was
his
kingdom
and
succeeded
in
a
few
weeks
without
bloodshed
in
upsetting
all
organised
authority
in
france
under
its
legitimate
king
is
it
possible
for
the
personal
ascendency
of
a
man
to
affirm
itself
in
a
more
astonishing
manner
but
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
this
campaign
which
was
his
last
how
remarkable
too
is
the
ascendency
he
exercised
over
the
allies
obliging
them
to
follow
his
initiative
and
how
near
he
came
to
crushing
them
his
prestige
outlived
him
and
continued
to
grow
it
is
his
prestige
that
made
an
emperor
of
his
obscure
nephew
how
powerful
is
his
memory
still
is
seen
in
the
resurrection
of
his
legend
in
progress
at
the
present
day
men
as
you
will
massacre
them
by
millions
be
the
cause
of
invasion
upon
invasion
all
is
permitted
you
if
you
possess
prestige
in
a
sufficient
degree
and
the
talent
necessary
to
uphold
it
i
have
invoked
no
doubt
in
this
case
a
quite
exceptional
example
of
prestige
but
one
it
was
useful
to
cite
to
make
clear
the
genesis
of
great
religions
great
doctrines
and
great
empires
were
it
not
for
the
power
exerted
on
the
crowd
by
prestige
such
growths
would
be
incomprehensible
prestige
however
is
not
based
solely
on
personal
ascendency
military
glory
and
religious
terror
it
may
have
a
more
modest
origin
and
still
be
considerable
our
century
furnishes
several
examples
one
of
the
most
striking
ones
that
posterity
will
recall
from
age
to
age
will
be
supplied
by
the
history
of
the
illustrious
man
who
modified
the
face
of
the
globe
and
the
commercial
relations
of
the
nations
by
separating
two
continents
he
succeeded
in
his
enterprise
owing
to
his
immense
strength
of
will
but
also
owing
to
the
fascination
he
exercised
on
those
surrounding
him
to
overcome
the
unanimous
opposition
he
met
with
he
had
only
to
show
himself
he
would
speak
briefly
and
in
face
of
the
charm
he
exerted
his
opponents
became
his
friends
the
english
in
particular
strenuously
opposed
his
scheme
he
had
only
to
put
in
an
appearance
in
england
to
rally
all
suffrages
in
later
years
when
he
passed
southampton
the
bells
were
rung
on
his
passage
and
at
the
present
day
a
movement
is
on
foot
in
england
to
raise
a
statue
in
his
honour
having
vanquished
whatever
there
is
to
vanquish
men
and
things
marshes
rocks
and
sandy
wastes
he
had
ceased
to
believe
in
obstacles
and
wished
to
begin
suez
over
again
at
panama
he
began
again
with
the
same
methods
as
of
old
but
he
had
aged
and
besides
the
faith
that
moves
mountains
does
not
move
them
if
they
are
too
lofty
the
mountains
resisted
and
the
catastrophe
that
ensued
destroyed
the
glittering
aureole
of
glory
that
enveloped
the
hero
his
life
teaches
how
prestige
can
grow
and
how
it
can
vanish
after
rivalling
in
greatness
the
most
famous
heroes
of
history
he
was
lowered
by
the
magistrates
of
his
country
to
the
ranks
of
the
vilest
criminals
when
he
died
his
coffin
unattended
traversed
an
indifferent
crowd
foreign
sovereigns
are
alone
in
rendering
homage
to
his
memory
as
to
that
of
one
of
the
greatest
men
that
history
has
known
an
austrian
paper
the
neue
freie
presse
of
vienna
has
indulged
on
the
subject
of
the
destiny
of
de
lesseps
in
reflections
marked
by
a
most
judicious
psychological
insight
i
therefore
reproduce
them
here
after
the
condemnation
of
ferdinand
de
lesseps
one
has
no
longer
the
right
to
be
astonished
at
the
sad
end
of
christopher
columbus
if
ferdinand
de
lesseps
were
a
rogue
every
noble
illusion
is
a
crime
antiquity
would
have
crowned
the
memory
of
de
lesseps
with
an
aureole
of
glory
and
would
have
made
him
drink
from
the
bowl
of
nectar
in
the
midst
of
olympus
for
he
has
altered
the
face
of
the
earth
and
accomplished
works
which
make
the
creation
more
perfect
the
president
of
the
court
of
appeal
has
immortalised
himself
by
condemning
ferdinand
de
lesseps
for
the
nations
will
always
demand
the
name
of
the
man
who
was
not
afraid
to
debase
his
century
by
investing
with
the
convict
cap
an
aged
man
whose
life
redounded
to
the
glory
of
his
contemporaries
let
there
be
no
more
talk
in
the
future
of
inflexible
justice
there
where
reigns
a
bureaucratic
hatred
of
audacious
feats
the
nations
have
need
of
audacious
men
who
believe
in
themselves
and
overcome
every
obstacle
without
concern
for
their
personal
safety
genius
can
not
be
prudent
by
dint
of
prudence
it
could
never
enlarge
the
sphere
of
human
activity
ferdinand
de
lesseps
has
known
the
intoxication
of
triumph
and
the
bitterness
of
disappointment
suez
and
panama
at
this
point
the
heart
revolts
at
the
morality
of
success
when
de
lesseps
had
succeeded
in
joining
two
seas
princes
and
nations
rendered
him
their
homage
when
he
meets
with
failure
among
the
rocks
of
the
cordilleras
he
is
nothing
but
a
vulgar
rogue
in
this
result
we
see
a
war
between
the
classes
of
society
the
discontent
of
bureaucrats
and
employes
who
take
their
revenge
with
the
aid
of
the
criminal
code
on
those
who
would
raise
themselves
above
their
fellows
modern
legislators
are
filled
with
embarrassment
when
confronted
by
the
lofty
ideas
due
to
human
genius
the
public
comprehends
such
ideas
still
less
and
it
is
easy
for
an
to
prove
that
stanley
is
a
murderer
and
de
lesseps
a
deceiver
still
the
various
examples
that
have
just
been
cited
represent
extreme
cases
to
fix
in
detail
the
psychology
of
prestige
it
would
be
necessary
to
place
them
at
the
extremity
of
a
series
which
would
range
from
the
founders
of
religions
and
empires
to
the
private
individual
who
endeavours
to
dazzle
his
neighbours
by
a
new
coat
or
a
decoration
between
the
extreme
limits
of
this
series
would
find
a
place
all
the
forms
of
prestige
resulting
from
the
different
elements
composing
a
civilisation
sciences
arts
literature
and
it
would
be
seen
that
prestige
constitutes
the
fundamental
element
of
persuasion
consciously
or
not
the
being
the
idea
or
the
thing
possessing
prestige
is
immediately
imitated
in
consequence
of
contagion
and
forces
an
entire
generation
to
adopt
certain
modes
of
feeling
and
of
giving
expression
to
its
thought
this
imitation
moreover
is
as
a
rule
unconscious
which
accounts
for
the
fact
that
it
is
perfect
the
modern
painters
who
copy
the
pale
colouring
and
the
stiff
attitudes
of
some
of
the
primitives
are
scarcely
alive
to
the
source
of
their
inspiration
they
believe
in
their
own
sincerity
whereas
if
an
eminent
master
had
not
revived
this
form
of
art
people
would
have
continued
blind
to
all
but
its
naive
and
inferior
sides
those
artists
who
after
the
manner
of
another
illustrious
master
inundate
their
canvasses
with
violet
shades
do
not
see
in
nature
more
violet
than
was
detected
there
fifty
years
ago
but
they
are
influenced
suggestioned
by
the
personal
and
special
impressions
of
a
painter
who
in
spite
of
this
eccentricity
was
successful
in
acquiring
great
prestige
similar
examples
might
be
brought
forward
in
connection
with
all
the
elements
of
civilisation
it
is
seen
from
what
precedes
that
a
number
of
factors
may
be
concerned
in
the
genesis
of
prestige
among
them
success
was
always
one
of
the
most
important
every
successful
man
every
idea
that
forces
itself
into
recognition
ceases
ipso
facto
to
be
called
in
question
the
proof
that
success
is
one
of
the
principal
to
prestige
is
that
the
disappearance
of
the
one
is
almost
always
followed
by
the
disappearance
of
the
other
the
hero
whom
the
crowd
acclaimed
yesterday
is
insulted
should
he
have
been
overtaken
by
failure
the
reaction
indeed
will
be
the
stronger
in
proportion
as
the
prestige
has
been
great
the
crowd
in
this
case
considers
the
fallen
hero
as
an
equal
and
takes
its
revenge
for
having
bowed
to
a
superiority
whose
existence
it
no
longer
admits
while
robespierre
was
causing
the
execution
of
his
colleagues
and
of
a
great
number
of
his
contemporaries
he
possessed
an
immense
prestige
when
the
transposition
of
a
few
votes
deprived
him
of
power
he
immediately
lost
his
prestige
and
the
crowd
followed
him
to
the
guillotine
with
the
imprecations
with
which
shortly
before
it
had
pursued
his
victims
believers
always
break
the
statues
of
their
former
gods
with
every
symptom
of
fury
prestige
lost
by
want
of
success
disappears
in
a
brief
space
of
time
it
can
also
be
worn
away
but
more
slowly
by
being
subjected
to
discussion
this
latter
power
however
is
exceedingly
sure
from
the
moment
prestige
is
called
in
question
it
ceases
to
be
prestige
the
gods
and
men
who
have
kept
their
prestige
for
long
have
never
tolerated
discussion
for
the
crowd
to
admire
it
must
be
kept
at
a
distance
chapter
iv
limitations
of
the
variability
of
the
beliefs
and
opinions
of
crowds
fixed
beliefs
the
invariability
of
certain
general
beliefs
they
shape
the
course
of
a
civilisation
the
difficulty
of
uprooting
them
in
what
respect
intolerance
is
a
virtue
in
a
people
the
philosophic
absurdity
of
a
belief
can
not
interfere
with
its
spreading
the
changeable
opinions
of
crowds
the
extreme
mobility
of
opinions
which
do
not
arise
from
general
beliefs
apparent
variations
of
ideas
and
beliefs
in
less
than
a
century
the
real
limits
of
these
variations
the
matters
effected
by
the
variation
the
disappearance
at
present
in
progress
of
general
beliefs
and
the
extreme
diffusion
of
the
newspaper
press
have
for
result
that
opinions
are
nowadays
more
and
more
changeable
why
the
opinions
of
crowds
tend
on
the
majority
of
subjects
towards
indifference
governments
now
powerless
to
direct
opinion
as
they
formerly
did
opinions
prevented
from
being
tyrannical
on
account
of
their
exceeding
divergency
fixed
beliefs
a
close
parallel
exists
between
the
anatomical
and
psychological
characteristics
of
living
beings
in
these
anatomical
characteristics
certain
invariable
or
slightly
variable
elements
are
met
with
to
change
which
the
lapse
is
necessary
of
geological
ages
side
by
side
with
these
fixed
indestructible
features
are
to
be
found
others
extremely
changeable
which
the
art
of
the
breeder
or
horticulturist
may
easily
modify
and
at
times
to
such
an
extent
as
to
conceal
the
fundamental
characteristics
from
an
observer
at
all
inattentive
the
same
phenomenon
is
observed
in
the
case
of
moral
characteristics
alongside
the
unalterable
psychological
elements
of
a
race
mobile
and
changeable
elements
are
to
be
encountered
for
this
reason
in
studying
the
beliefs
and
opinions
of
a
people
the
presence
is
always
detected
of
a
fixed
groundwork
on
which
are
engrafted
opinions
as
changing
as
the
surface
sand
on
a
rock
the
opinions
and
beliefs
of
crowds
may
be
divided
then
into
two
very
distinct
classes
on
the
one
hand
we
have
great
permanent
beliefs
which
endure
for
several
centuries
and
on
which
an
entire
civilisation
may
rest
such
for
instance
in
the
past
were
feudalism
christianity
and
protestantism
and
such
in
our
own
time
are
the
nationalist
principle
and
contemporary
democratic
and
social
ideas
in
the
second
place
there
are
the
transitory
changing
opinions
the
outcome
as
a
rule
of
general
conceptions
of
which
every
age
sees
the
birth
and
disappearance
examples
in
point
are
the
theories
which
mould
literature
and
the
arts
those
for
instance
which
produced
romanticism
naturalism
mysticism
opinions
of
this
order
are
as
superficial
as
a
rule
as
fashion
and
as
changeable
they
may
be
compared
to
the
ripples
which
ceaselessly
arise
and
vanish
on
the
surface
of
a
deep
lake
the
great
generalised
beliefs
are
very
restricted
in
number
their
rise
and
fall
form
the
culminating
points
of
the
history
of
every
historic
race
they
constitute
the
real
framework
of
civilisation
it
is
easy
to
imbue
the
mind
of
crowds
with
a
passing
opinion
but
very
difficult
to
implant
therein
a
lasting
belief
however
a
belief
of
this
latter
description
once
established
it
is
equally
difficult
to
uproot
it
it
is
usually
only
to
be
changed
at
the
cost
of
violent
revolutions
even
revolutions
can
only
avail
when
the
belief
has
almost
entirely
lost
its
sway
over
men
minds
in
that
case
revolutions
serve
to
finally
sweep
away
what
had
already
been
almost
cast
aside
though
the
force
of
habit
prevented
its
complete
abandonment
the
beginning
of
a
revolution
is
in
reality
the
end
of
a
belief
the
precise
moment
at
which
a
great
belief
is
doomed
is
easily
recognisable
it
is
the
moment
when
its
value
begins
to
be
called
in
question
every
general
belief
being
little
else
than
a
fiction
it
can
only
survive
on
the
condition
that
it
be
not
subjected
to
examination
but
even
when
a
belief
is
severely
shaken
the
institutions
to
which
it
has
given
rise
retain
their
strength
and
disappear
but
slowly
finally
when
the
belief
has
completely
lost
its
force
all
that
rested
upon
it
is
soon
involved
in
ruin
as
yet
a
nation
has
never
been
able
to
change
its
beliefs
without
being
condemned
at
the
same
time
to
transform
all
the
elements
of
its
civilisation
the
nation
continues
this
process
of
transformation
until
it
has
alighted
on
and
accepted
a
new
general
belief
until
this
juncture
it
is
perforce
in
a
state
of
anarchy
general
beliefs
are
the
indispensable
pillars
of
civilisations
they
determine
the
trend
of
ideas
they
alone
are
capable
of
inspiring
faith
and
creating
a
sense
of
duty
nations
have
always
been
conscious
of
the
utility
of
acquiring
general
beliefs
and
have
instinctively
understood
that
their
disappearance
would
be
the
signal
for
their
own
decline
in
the
case
of
the
romans
the
fanatical
cult
of
rome
was
the
belief
that
made
them
masters
of
the
world
and
when
the
belief
had
died
out
rome
was
doomed
to
die
as
for
the
barbarians
who
destroyed
the
roman
civilisation
it
was
only
when
they
had
acquired
certain
commonly
accepted
beliefs
that
they
attained
a
measure
of
cohesion
and
emerged
from
anarchy
plainly
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
nations
have
always
displayed
intolerance
in
the
defence
of
their
opinions
this
intolerance
open
as
it
is
to
criticism
from
the
philosophic
standpoint
represents
in
the
life
of
a
people
the
most
necessary
of
virtues
it
was
to
found
or
uphold
general
beliefs
that
so
many
victims
were
sent
to
the
stake
in
the
middle
ages
and
that
so
many
inventors
and
innovators
have
died
in
despair
even
if
they
have
escaped
martyrdom
it
is
in
defence
too
of
such
beliefs
that
the
world
has
been
so
often
the
scene
of
the
direst
disorder
and
that
so
many
millions
of
men
have
died
on
the
battlefield
and
will
yet
die
there
there
are
great
difficulties
in
the
way
of
establishing
a
general
belief
but
when
it
is
definitely
implanted
its
power
is
for
a
long
time
to
come
invincible
and
however
false
it
be
philosophically
it
imposes
itself
upon
the
most
luminous
intelligence
have
not
the
european
peoples
regarded
as
incontrovertible
for
more
than
fifteen
centuries
religious
legends
which
closely
examined
are
as
barbarous
as
those
of
moloch
the
frightful
absurdity
of
the
legend
of
a
god
who
revenges
himself
for
the
disobedience
of
one
of
his
creatures
by
inflicting
horrible
tortures
on
his
son
remained
unperceived
during
many
centuries
such
potent
geniuses
as
a
galileo
a
newton
and
a
leibnitz
never
supposed
for
an
instant
that
the
truth
of
such
dogmas
could
be
called
in
question
nothing
can
be
more
typical
than
this
fact
of
the
hypnotising
effect
of
general
beliefs
but
at
the
same
time
nothing
can
mark
more
decisively
the
humiliating
limitations
of
our
intelligence
barbarous
philosophically
speaking
i
mean
in
practice
they
have
created
an
entirely
new
civilisation
and
for
fifteen
centuries
have
given
mankind
a
glimpse
of
those
enchanted
realms
of
generous
dreams
and
of
hope
which
he
will
know
no
more
as
soon
as
a
new
dogma
is
implanted
in
the
mind
of
crowds
it
becomes
the
source
of
inspiration
whence
are
evolved
its
institutions
arts
and
mode
of
existence
the
sway
it
exerts
over
men
minds
under
these
circumstances
is
absolute
men
of
action
have
no
thought
beyond
realising
the
accepted
belief
legislators
beyond
applying
it
while
philosophers
artists
and
men
of
letters
are
solely
preoccupied
with
its
expression
under
various
shapes
from
the
fundamental
belief
transient
accessory
ideas
may
arise
but
they
always
bear
the
impress
of
the
belief
from
which
they
have
sprung
the
egyptian
civilisation
the
european
civilisation
of
the
middle
ages
the
mussulman
civilisation
of
the
arabs
are
all
the
outcome
of
a
small
number
of
religious
beliefs
which
have
left
their
mark
on
the
least
important
elements
of
these
civilisations
and
allow
of
their
immediate
recognition
thus
it
is
that
thanks
to
general
beliefs
the
men
of
every
age
are
enveloped
in
a
network
of
traditions
opinions
and
customs
which
render
them
all
alike
and
from
whose
yoke
they
can
not
extricate
themselves
men
are
guided
in
their
conduct
above
all
by
their
beliefs
and
by
the
customs
that
are
the
consequence
of
those
beliefs
these
beliefs
and
customs
regulate
the
smallest
acts
of
our
existence
and
the
most
independent
spirit
can
not
escape
their
influence
the
tyranny
exercised
unconsciously
on
men
minds
is
the
only
real
tyranny
because
it
can
not
be
fought
against
tiberius
ghengis
khan
and
napoleon
were
assuredly
redoubtable
tyrants
but
from
the
depth
of
their
graves
moses
buddha
jesus
and
mahomet
have
exerted
on
the
human
soul
a
far
profounder
despotism
a
conspiracy
may
overthrow
a
tyrant
but
what
can
it
avail
against
a
firmly
established
belief
in
its
violent
struggle
with
roman
catholicism
it
is
the
french
revolution
that
has
been
vanquished
and
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
sympathy
of
the
crowd
was
apparently
on
its
side
and
in
spite
of
recourse
to
destructive
measures
as
pitiless
as
those
of
the
inquisition
the
only
real
tyrants
that
humanity
has
known
have
always
been
the
memories
of
its
dead
or
the
illusions
it
has
forged
itself
the
philosophic
absurdity
that
often
marks
general
beliefs
has
never
been
an
obstacle
to
their
triumph
indeed
the
triumph
of
such
beliefs
would
seem
impossible
unless
on
the
condition
that
they
offer
some
mysterious
absurdity
in
consequence
the
evident
weakness
of
the
socialist
beliefs
of
will
not
prevent
them
triumphing
among
the
masses
their
real
inferiority
to
all
religious
beliefs
is
solely
the
result
of
this
consideration
that
the
ideal
of
happiness
offered
by
the
latter
being
realisable
only
in
a
future
life
it
was
beyond
the
power
of
anybody
to
contest
it
the
socialist
ideal
of
happiness
being
intended
to
be
realised
on
earth
the
vanity
of
its
promises
will
at
once
appear
as
soon
as
the
first
efforts
towards
their
realisation
are
made
and
simultaneously
the
new
belief
will
entirely
lose
its
prestige
its
strength
in
consequence
will
only
increase
until
the
day
when
having
triumphed
its
practical
realisation
shall
commence
for
this
reason
while
the
new
religion
exerts
to
begin
with
like
all
those
that
have
preceded
it
a
destructive
influence
it
will
be
unable
in
the
future
to
play
a
creative
part
the
changeable
opinions
of
crowds
above
the
substratum
of
fixed
beliefs
whose
power
we
have
just
demonstrated
is
found
an
overlying
growth
of
opinions
ideas
and
thoughts
which
are
incessantly
springing
up
and
dying
out
some
of
them
exist
but
for
a
day
and
the
more
important
scarcely
outlive
a
generation
we
have
already
noted
that
the
changes
which
supervene
in
opinions
of
this
order
are
at
times
far
more
superficial
than
real
and
that
they
are
always
affected
by
racial
considerations
when
examining
for
instance
the
political
institutions
of
france
we
showed
that
parties
to
all
appearance
utterly
distinct
royalists
radicals
imperialists
socialists
have
an
ideal
absolutely
identical
and
that
this
ideal
is
solely
dependent
on
the
mental
structure
of
the
french
race
since
a
quite
contrary
ideal
is
found
under
analogous
names
among
other
races
neither
the
name
given
to
opinions
nor
deceptive
adaptations
alter
the
essence
of
things
the
men
of
the
great
revolution
saturated
with
latin
literature
who
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
roman
republic
adopted
its
laws
its
fasces
and
its
togas
did
not
become
romans
because
they
were
under
the
empire
of
a
powerful
historical
suggestion
the
task
of
the
philosopher
is
to
investigate
what
it
is
which
subsists
of
ancient
beliefs
beneath
their
apparent
changes
and
to
identify
amid
the
moving
flux
of
opinions
the
part
determined
by
general
beliefs
and
the
genius
of
the
race
in
the
absence
of
this
philosophic
test
it
might
be
supposed
that
crowds
change
their
political
or
religious
beliefs
frequently
and
at
will
all
history
whether
political
religious
artistic
or
literary
seems
to
prove
that
such
is
the
case
as
an
example
let
us
take
a
very
short
period
of
french
history
merely
that
from
to
a
period
of
thirty
duration
that
of
a
generation
in
the
course
of
it
we
see
the
crowd
at
first
monarchical
become
very
revolutionary
then
very
imperialist
and
again
very
monarchical
in
the
matter
of
religion
it
gravitates
in
the
same
lapse
of
time
from
catholicism
to
atheism
then
towards
deism
and
then
returns
to
the
most
pronounced
forms
of
catholicism
these
changes
take
place
not
only
amongst
the
masses
but
also
amongst
those
who
direct
them
we
observe
with
astonishment
the
prominent
men
of
the
convention
the
sworn
enemies
of
kings
men
who
would
have
neither
gods
nor
masters
become
the
humble
servants
of
napoleon
and
afterwards
under
louis
piously
carry
candles
in
religious
processions
numerous
too
are
the
changes
in
the
opinions
of
the
crowd
in
the
course
of
the
following
seventy
years
the
perfidious
albion
of
the
opening
of
the
century
is
the
ally
of
france
under
napoleon
heir
russia
twice
invaded
by
france
which
looked
on
with
satisfaction
at
french
reverses
becomes
its
friend
in
literature
art
and
philosophy
the
successive
evolutions
of
opinion
are
more
rapid
still
romanticism
naturalism
mysticism
spring
up
and
die
out
in
turn
the
artist
and
the
writer
applauded
yesterday
are
treated
on
the
morrow
with
profound
contempt
when
however
we
analyse
all
these
changes
in
appearance
so
far
reaching
what
do
we
find
all
those
that
are
in
opposition
with
the
general
beliefs
and
sentiments
of
the
race
are
of
transient
duration
and
the
diverted
stream
soon
resumes
its
course
the
opinions
which
are
not
linked
to
any
general
belief
or
sentiment
of
the
race
and
which
in
consequence
can
not
possess
stability
are
at
the
mercy
of
every
chance
or
if
the
expression
be
preferred
of
every
change
in
the
surrounding
circumstances
formed
by
suggestion
and
contagion
they
are
always
momentary
they
crop
up
and
disappear
as
rapidly
on
occasion
as
the
sandhills
formed
by
the
wind
on
the
at
the
present
day
the
changeable
opinions
of
crowds
are
greater
in
number
than
they
ever
were
and
for
three
different
reasons
the
first
is
that
as
the
old
beliefs
are
losing
their
influence
to
a
greater
and
greater
extent
they
are
ceasing
to
shape
the
ephemeral
opinions
of
the
moment
as
they
did
in
the
past
the
weakening
of
general
beliefs
clears
the
ground
for
a
crop
of
haphazard
opinions
without
a
past
or
a
future
the
second
reason
is
that
the
power
of
crowds
being
on
the
increase
and
this
power
being
less
and
less
counterbalanced
the
extreme
mobility
of
ideas
which
we
have
seen
to
be
a
peculiarity
of
crowds
can
manifest
itself
without
let
or
hindrance
finally
the
third
reason
is
the
recent
development
of
the
newspaper
press
by
whose
agency
the
most
contrary
opinions
are
being
continually
brought
before
the
attention
of
crowds
the
suggestions
that
might
result
from
each
individual
opinion
are
soon
destroyed
by
suggestions
of
an
opposite
character
the
consequence
is
that
no
opinion
succeeds
in
becoming
widespread
and
that
the
existence
of
all
of
them
is
ephemeral
an
opinion
nowadays
dies
out
before
it
has
found
a
sufficiently
wide
acceptance
to
become
general
a
phenomenon
quite
new
in
the
world
history
and
most
characteristic
of
the
present
age
has
resulted
from
these
different
causes
i
allude
to
the
powerlessness
of
governments
to
direct
opinion
in
the
past
and
in
no
very
distant
past
the
action
of
governments
and
the
influence
of
a
few
writers
and
a
very
small
number
of
newspapers
constituted
the
real
reflectors
of
public
opinion
the
writers
have
lost
all
influence
and
the
newspapers
only
reflect
opinion
as
for
statesmen
far
from
directing
opinion
their
only
endeavour
is
to
follow
it
they
have
a
dread
of
opinion
which
amounts
at
times
to
terror
and
causes
them
to
adopt
an
utterly
unstable
line
of
conduct
the
opinion
of
crowds
tends
then
more
and
more
to
become
the
supreme
guiding
principle
in
politics
it
goes
so
far
as
to
force
on
alliances
as
has
been
seen
recently
in
the
case
of
the
alliance
which
is
solely
the
outcome
of
a
popular
movement
a
curious
symptom
of
the
present
time
is
to
observe
popes
kings
and
emperors
consent
to
be
interviewed
as
a
means
of
submitting
their
views
on
a
given
subject
to
the
judgment
of
crowds
formerly
it
might
have
been
correct
to
say
that
politics
were
not
a
matter
of
sentiment
can
the
same
be
said
when
politics
are
more
and
more
swayed
by
the
impulse
of
changeable
crowds
who
are
uninfluenced
by
reason
and
can
only
be
guided
by
sentiment
as
to
the
press
which
formerly
directed
opinion
it
has
had
like
governments
to
humble
itself
before
the
power
of
crowds
it
wields
no
doubt
a
considerable
influence
but
only
because
it
is
exclusively
the
reflection
of
the
opinions
of
crowds
and
of
their
incessant
variations
become
a
mere
agency
for
the
supply
of
information
the
press
has
renounced
all
endeavour
to
enforce
an
idea
or
a
doctrine
it
follows
all
the
changes
of
public
thought
obliged
to
do
so
by
the
necessities
of
competition
under
pain
of
losing
its
readers
the
old
staid
and
influential
organs
of
the
past
such
as
the
constitutionnel
the
debats
or
the
siecle
which
were
accepted
as
oracles
by
the
preceding
generation
have
disappeared
or
have
become
typical
modern
papers
in
which
a
maximum
of
news
is
sandwiched
in
between
light
articles
society
gossip
and
financial
puffs
there
can
be
no
question
of
a
paper
rich
enough
to
allow
its
contributors
to
air
their
personal
opinions
and
such
opinions
would
be
of
slight
weight
with
readers
who
only
ask
to
be
kept
informed
or
to
be
amused
and
who
suspect
every
affirmation
of
being
prompted
by
motives
of
speculation
even
the
critics
have
ceased
to
be
able
to
assure
the
success
of
a
book
or
a
play
they
are
capable
of
doing
harm
but
not
of
doing
a
service
the
papers
are
so
conscious
of
the
uselessness
of
everything
in
the
shape
of
criticism
or
personal
opinion
that
they
have
reached
the
point
of
suppressing
literary
criticism
confining
themselves
to
citing
the
title
of
a
book
and
appending
a
puff
of
two
or
three
lines
in
twenty
years
time
the
same
fate
will
probably
have
overtaken
theatrical
criticism
these
remarks
refer
to
the
french
newspaper
note
of
the
translator
the
close
watching
of
the
course
of
opinion
has
become
the
principal
preoccupation
of
the
press
and
of
governments
the
effect
produced
by
an
event
a
legislative
proposal
a
speech
is
without
intermission
what
they
require
to
know
and
the
task
is
not
easy
for
nothing
is
more
mobile
and
changeable
than
the
thought
of
crowds
and
nothing
more
frequent
than
to
see
them
execrate
what
they
applauded
yesterday
this
total
absence
of
any
sort
of
direction
of
opinion
and
at
the
same
time
the
destruction
of
general
beliefs
have
had
for
final
result
an
extreme
divergency
of
convictions
of
every
order
and
a
growing
indifference
on
the
part
of
crowds
to
everything
that
does
not
plainly
touch
their
immediate
interests
questions
of
doctrine
such
as
socialism
only
recruit
champions
boasting
genuine
convictions
among
the
quite
illiterate
classes
among
the
workers
in
mines
and
factories
for
instance
members
of
the
lower
middle
class
and
working
men
possessing
some
degree
of
instruction
have
either
become
utterly
sceptical
or
extremely
unstable
in
their
opinions
the
evolution
which
has
been
effected
in
this
direction
in
the
last
years
is
striking
during
the
preceding
period
comparatively
near
us
though
it
is
opinions
still
had
a
certain
general
trend
they
had
their
origin
in
the
acceptance
of
some
fundamental
belief
by
the
mere
fact
that
an
individual
was
a
monarchist
he
possessed
inevitably
certain
clearly
defined
ideas
in
history
as
well
as
in
science
while
by
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
a
republican
his
ideas
were
quite
contrary
a
monarchist
was
well
aware
that
men
are
not
descended
from
monkeys
and
a
republican
was
not
less
well
aware
that
such
is
in
truth
their
descent
it
was
the
duty
of
the
monarchist
to
speak
with
horror
and
of
the
republican
to
speak
with
veneration
of
the
great
revolution
there
were
certain
names
such
as
those
of
robespierre
and
marat
that
had
to
be
uttered
with
an
air
of
religious
devotion
and
other
names
such
as
those
of
caesar
augustus
or
napoleon
that
ought
never
to
be
mentioned
unaccompanied
by
a
torrent
of
invective
even
in
the
french
sorbonne
this
ingenuous
fashion
of
conceiving
history
was
general
there
are
pages
in
the
books
of
the
french
official
professors
of
history
that
are
very
curious
from
this
point
of
view
they
prove
too
how
little
the
critical
spirit
is
developed
by
the
system
of
university
education
in
vogue
in
france
i
cite
as
an
example
the
following
extracts
from
the
french
revolution
of
rambaud
professor
of
history
at
the
sorbonne
the
taking
of
the
bastille
was
a
culminating
event
in
the
history
not
only
of
france
but
of
all
europe
and
inaugurated
a
new
epoch
in
the
history
of
the
world
with
respect
to
robespierre
we
learn
with
stupefaction
that
his
dictatorship
was
based
more
especially
on
opinion
persuasion
and
moral
authority
it
was
a
sort
of
pontificate
in
the
hands
of
a
virtuous
man
pp
and
at
the
present
day
as
the
result
of
discussion
and
analysis
all
opinions
are
losing
their
prestige
their
distinctive
features
are
rapidly
worn
away
and
few
survive
capable
of
arousing
our
enthusiasm
the
man
of
modern
times
is
more
and
more
a
prey
to
indifference
the
general
wearing
away
of
opinions
should
not
be
too
greatly
deplored
that
it
is
a
symptom
of
decadence
in
the
life
of
a
people
can
not
be
contested
it
is
certain
that
men
of
immense
of
almost
supernatural
insight
that
apostles
leaders
of
crowds
men
in
a
word
of
genuine
and
strong
convictions
exert
a
far
greater
force
than
men
who
deny
who
criticise
or
who
are
indifferent
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
given
the
power
possessed
at
present
by
crowds
were
a
single
opinion
to
acquire
sufficient
prestige
to
enforce
its
general
acceptance
it
would
soon
be
endowed
with
so
tyrannical
a
strength
that
everything
would
have
to
bend
before
it
and
the
era
of
free
discussion
would
be
closed
for
a
long
time
crowds
are
occasionally
masters
as
were
heliogabalus
and
tiberius
but
they
are
also
violently
capricious
a
civilisation
when
the
moment
has
come
for
crowds
to
acquire
a
high
hand
over
it
is
at
the
mercy
of
too
many
chances
to
endure
for
long
could
anything
postpone
for
a
while
the
hour
of
its
ruin
it
would
be
precisely
the
extreme
instability
of
the
opinions
of
crowds
and
their
growing
indifference

respect
to
all
general

the

of
crowds
the
general
divisions
of
crowds
their
classification
heterogeneous
crowds
different
varieties
of
them
the
influence
of
race
the
spirit
of
the
crowd
is
weak
in
proportion
as
the
spirit
of
the
race
is
strong
the
spirit
of
the
race

the
civilised
state
and
the
spirit
of
the
crowd
the
barbarian
state
homogeneous
crowds
their
different
varieties
sects
castes
and
classes
we
have
sketched
in
this
work
the
general
characteristics
common
to
psychological
crowds
it
remains
to
point
out
the
particular
characteristics
which
accompany
those
of
a
general
order
in
the
different
categories
of
collectivities
when
they
are
transformed
into
a
crowd
under
the
influences
of
the
proper
exciting
causes
we
will
first
of
all
set
forth
in
a
few
words
a
classification
of
crowds
our
will
be
the
simple
multitude
its
most
inferior
form
is
met
with
when
the
multitude
is
composed
of
individuals
belonging
to
different
races
in
this
case
its
only
common
bond
of
union
is
the
will
more
or
less
respected
of
a
chief
the
barbarians
of
very
diverse
origin
who
during
several
centuries
invaded
the
roman
empire
may
be
cited
as
a
specimen
of
multitudes
of
this
kind
on
a
higher
level
than
these
multitudes
composed
of
different
races
are
those
which
under
certain
influences
have
acquired
common
characteristics
and
have
ended
by
forming
a
single
race
they
present
at
times
characteristics
peculiar
to
crowds
but
these
characteristics
are
overruled
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
by
racial
considerations
these
two
kinds
of
multitudes
may
under
certain
influences
investigated
in
this
work
be
transformed
into
organised
or
psychological
crowds
we
shall
break
up
these
organised
crowds
into
the
following
divisions
anonymous
crowds
street
crowds
for
example
heterogeneous
crowds
not
anonymous
crowds
juries
parliamentary
assemblies
sects
political
sects
religious
sects
castes
the
military
caste
homogeneous
the
priestly
caste
the
crowds
working
caste
classes
the
middle
classes
the
peasant
classes
we
will
point
out
briefly
the
distinguishing
characteristics
of
these
different
categories
of
crowds
heterogeneous
crowds
it
is
these
collectivities
whose
characteristics
have
been
studied
in
this
volume
they
are
composed
of
individuals
of
any
description
of
any
profession
and
any
degree
of
intelligence
we
are
now
aware
that
by
the
mere
fact
that
men
form
part
of
a
crowd
engaged
in
action
their
collective
psychology
differs
essentially
from
their
individual
psychology
and
their
intelligence
is
affected
by
this
differentiation
we
have
seen
that
intelligence
is
without
influence
in
collectivities
they
being
solely
under
the
sway
of
unconscious
sentiments
a
fundamental
factor
that
of
race
allows
of
a
tolerably
thorough
differentiation
of
the
various
heterogeneous
crowds
we
have
often
referred
already
to
the
part
played
by
race
and
have
shown
it
to
be
the
most
powerful
of
the
factors
capable
of
determining
men
actions
its
action
is
also
to
be
traced
in
the
character
of
crowds
a
crowd
composed
of
individuals
assembled
at
haphazard
but
all
of
them
englishmen
or
chinamen
will
differ
widely
from
another
crowd
also
composed
of
individuals
of
any
and
every
description
but
of
other
races
russians
frenchmen
or
spaniards
for
example
the
wide
divergencies
which
their
inherited
mental
constitution
creates
in
men
modes
of
feeling
and
thinking
at
once
come
into
prominence
when
which
rarely
happens
circumstances
gather
together
in
the
same
crowd
and
in
fairly
equal
proportions
individuals
of
different
nationality
and
this
occurs
however
identical
in
appearance
be
the
interests
which
provoked
the
gathering
the
efforts
made
by
the
socialists
to
assemble
in
great
congresses
the
representatives
of
the
populations
of
different
countries
have
always
ended
in
the
most
pronounced
discord
a
latin
crowd
however
revolutionary
or
however
conservative
it
be
supposed
will
invariably
appeal
to
the
intervention
of
the
state
to
realise
its
demands
it
is
always
distinguished
by
a
marked
tendency
towards
centralisation
and
by
a
leaning
more
or
less
pronounced
in
favour
of
a
dictatorship
an
english
or
an
american
crowd
on
the
contrary
sets
no
store
on
the
state
and
only
appeals
to
private
initiative
a
french
crowd
lays
particular
weight
on
equality
and
an
english
crowd
on
liberty
these
differences
of
race
explain
how
it
is
that
there
are
almost
as
many
different
forms
of
socialism
and
democracy
as
there
are
nations
the
genius
of
the
race
then
exerts
a
paramount
influence
upon
the
dispositions
of
a
crowd
it
is
the
powerful
underlying
force
that
limits
its
changes
of
humour
it
should
be
considered
as
an
essential
law
that
the
inferior
characteristics
of
crowds
are
the
less
accentuated
in
proportion
as
the
spirit
of
the
race
is
strong
the
crowd
state
and
the
domination
of
crowds
is
equivalent
to
the
barbarian
state
or
to
a
return
to
it
it
is
by
the
acquisition
of
a
solidly
constituted
collective
spirit
that
the
race
frees
itself
to
a
greater
and
greater
extent
from
the
unreflecting
power
of
crowds
and
emerges
from
the
barbarian
state
the
only
important
classification
to
be
made
of
heterogeneous
crowds
apart
from
that
based
on
racial
considerations
is
to
separate
them
into
anonymous
crowds
such
as
street
crowds
and
crowds
not
anonymous
deliberative
assemblies
and
juries
for
example
the
sentiment
of
responsibility
absent
from
crowds
of
the
first
description
and
developed
in
those
of
the
second
often
gives
a
very
different
tendency
to
their
respective
acts
homogeneous
crowds
homogeneous
crowds
include
sects
castes
classes
the
sect
represents
the
first
step
in
the
process
of
organisation
of
homogeneous
crowds
a
sect
includes
individuals
differing
greatly
as
to
their
education
their
professions
and
the
class
of
society
to
which
they
belong
and
with
their
common
beliefs
as
the
connecting
link
examples
in
point
are
religious
and
political
sects
the
caste
represents
the
highest
degree
of
organisation
of
which
the
crowd
is
susceptible
while
the
sect
includes
individuals
of
very
different
professions
degrees
of
education
and
social
surrounding
who
are
only
linked
together
by
the
beliefs
they
hold
in
common
the
caste
is
composed
of
individuals
of
the
same
profession
and
in
consequence
similarly
educated
and
of
much
the
same
social
status
examples
in
point
are
the
military
and
priestly
castes
the
class
is
formed
of
individuals
of
diverse
origin
linked
together
not
by
a
community
of
beliefs
as
are
the
members
of
a
sect
or
by
common
professional
occupations
as
are
the
members
of
a
caste
but
by
certain
interests
and
certain
habits
of
life
and
education
almost
identical
the
middle
class
and
the
agricultural
class
are
examples
being
only
concerned
in
this
work
with
heterogeneous
crowds
and
reserving
the
study
of
homogeneous
crowds
sects
castes
and
classes
for
another
volume
i
shall
not
insist
here
on
the
characteristics
of
crowds
of
this
latter
kind
i
shall
conclude
this
study
of
heterogeneous
crowds
by
the
examination
of
a
few
typical
and
distinct
categories
of
crowds
chapter
ii
crowds
termed
criminal
crowds
crowds
termed
criminal
crowds
a
crowd
may
be
legally
yet
not
psychologically
criminal
the
absolute
unconsciousness
of
the
acts
of
crowds
various
examples
psychology
of
the
authors
of
the
september
massacres
their
reasoning
their
sensibility
their
ferocity
and
their
morality
owing
to
the
fact
that
crowds
after
a
period
of
excitement
enter
upon
a
purely
automatic
and
unconscious
state
in
which
they
are
guided
by
suggestion
it
seems
difficult
to
qualify
them
in
any
case
as
criminal
i
only
retain
this
erroneous
qualification
because
it
has
been
definitely
brought
into
vogue
by
recent
psychological
investigations
certain
acts
of
crowds
are
assuredly
criminal
if
considered
merely
in
themselves
but
criminal
in
that
case
in
the
same
way
as
the
act
of
a
tiger
devouring
a
hindoo
after
allowing
its
young
to
maul
him
for
their
amusement
the
usual
motive
of
the
crimes
of
crowds
is
a
powerful
suggestion
and
the
individuals
who
take
part
in
such
crimes
are
afterwards
convinced
that
they
have
acted
in
obedience
to
duty
which
is
far
from
being
the
case
with
the
ordinary
criminal
the
history
of
the
crimes
committed
by
crowds
illustrates
what
precedes
the
murder
of
de
launay
the
governor
of
the
bastille
may
be
cited
as
a
typical
example
after
the
taking
of
the
fortress
the
governor
surrounded
by
a
very
excited
crowd
was
dealt
blows
from
every
direction
it
was
proposed
to
hang
him
to
cut
off
his
head
to
tie
him
to
a
horse
tail
while
struggling
he
accidently
kicked
one
of
those
present
some
one
proposed
and
his
suggestion
was
at
once
received
with
acclamation
by
the
crowd
that
the
individual
who
had
been
kicked
should
cut
the
governor
throat
the
individual
in
question
a
cook
out
of
work
whose
chief
reason
for
being
at
the
bastille
was
idle
curiosity
as
to
what
was
going
on
esteems
that
since
such
is
the
general
opinion
the
action
is
patriotic
and
even
believes
he
deserves
a
medal
for
having
destroyed
a
monster
with
a
sword
that
is
lent
him
he
strikes
the
bared
neck
but
the
weapon
being
somewhat
blunt
and
not
cutting
he
takes
from
his
pocket
a
small
knife
and
in
his
capacity
of
cook
he
would
be
experienced
in
cutting
up
meat
successfully
effects
the
operation
the
working
of
the
process
indicated
above
is
clearly
seen
in
this
example
we
have
obedience
to
a
suggestion
which
is
all
the
stronger
because
of
its
collective
origin
and
the
conviction
that
he
has
committed
a
very
meritorious
act
a
conviction
the
more
natural
seeing
that
he
enjoys
the
unanimous
approval
of
his
an
act
of
this
kind
may
be
considered
crime
legally
but
not
psychologically
the
general
characteristics
of
criminal
crowds
are
precisely
the
same
as
those
we
have
met
with
in
all
crowds
openness
to
suggestion
credulity
mobility
the
exaggeration
of
the
sentiments
good
or
bad
the
manifestation
of
certain
forms
of
morality
we
shall
find
all
these
characteristics
present
in
a
crowd
which
has
left
behind
it
in
french
history
the
most
sinister
memories
the
crowd
which
perpetrated
the
september
massacres
in
point
of
fact
it
offers
much
similarity
with
the
crowd
that
committed
the
saint
bartholomew
massacres
i
borrow
the
details
from
the
narration
of
taine
who
took
them
from
contemporary
sources
it
is
not
known
exactly
who
gave
the
order
or
made
the
suggestion
to
empty
the
prisons
by
massacring
the
prisoners
whether
it
was
danton
as
is
probable
or
another
does
not
matter
the
one
interesting
fact
for
us
is
the
powerful
suggestion
received
by
the
crowd
charged
with
the
massacre
the
crowd
of
murderers
numbered
some
three
hundred
persons
and
was
a
perfectly
typical
heterogeneous
crowd
with
the
exception
of
a
very
small
number
of
professional
scoundrels
it
was
composed
in
the
main
of
shopkeepers
and
artisans
of
every
trade
bootmakers
locksmiths
hairdressers
masons
clerks
messengers
under
the
influence
of
the
suggestion
received
they
are
perfectly
convinced
as
was
the
cook
referred
to
above
that
they
are
accomplishing
a
patriotic
duty
they
fill
a
double
office
being
at
once
judge
and
executioner
but
they
do
not
for
a
moment
regard
themselves
as
criminals
deeply
conscious
of
the
importance
of
their
duty
they
begin
by
forming
a
sort
of
tribunal
and
in
connection
with
this
act
the
ingenuousness
of
crowds
and
their
rudimentary
conception
of
justice
are
seen
immediately
in
consideration
of
the
large
number
of
the
accused
it
is
decided
that
to
begin
with
the
nobles
priests
officers
and
members
of
the
household
in
a
word
all
the
individuals
whose
mere
profession
is
proof
of
their
guilt
in
the
eyes
of
a
good
patriot
shall
be
slaughtered
in
a
body
there
being
no
need
for
a
special
decision
in
their
case
the
remainder
shall
be
judged
on
their
personal
appearance
and
their
reputation
in
this
way
the
rudimentary
conscience
of
the
crowd
is
satisfied
it
will
now
be
able
to
proceed
legally
with
the
massacre
and
to
give
free
scope
to
those
instincts
of
ferocity
whose
genesis
i
have
set
forth
elsewhere
they
being
instincts
which
collectivities
always
have
it
in
them
to
develop
to
a
high
degree
these
instincts
however
as
is
regularly
the
case
in
crowds
will
not
prevent
the
manifestation
of
other
and
contrary
sentiments
such
as
a
tenderheartedness
often
as
extreme
as
the
ferocity
they
have
the
expansive
sympathy
and
prompt
sensibility
of
the
parisian
working
man
at
the
abbaye
one
of
the
federates
learning
that
the
prisoners
had
been
left
without
water
for
hours
was
bent
on
putting
the
gaoler
to
death
and
would
have
done
so
but
for
the
prayers
of
the
prisoners
themselves
when
a
prisoner
is
acquitted
by
the
improvised
tribunal
every
one
guards
and
slaughterers
included
embraces
him
with
transports
of
joy
and
applauds
frantically
after
which
the
wholesale
massacre
is
recommenced
during
its
progress
a
pleasant
gaiety
never
ceases
to
reign
there
is
dancing
and
singing
around
the
corpses
and
benches
are
arranged
for
the
ladies
delighted
to
witness
the
killing
of
aristocrats
the
exhibition
continues
moreover
of
a
special
description
of
justice
a
slaughterer
at
the
abbaye
having
complained
that
the
ladies
placed
at
a
little
distance
saw
badly
and
that
only
a
few
of
those
present
had
the
pleasure
of
striking
the
aristocrats
the
justice
of
the
observation
is
admitted
and
it
is
decided
that
the
victims
shall
be
made
to
pass
slowly
between
two
rows
of
slaughterers
who
shall
be
under
the
obligation
to
strike
with
the
back
of
the
sword
only
so
as
to
prolong
the
agony
at
the
prison
de
la
force
the
victims
are
stripped
stark
naked
and
literally
carved
for
half
an
hour
after
which
when
every
one
has
had
a
good
view
they
are
finished
off
by
a
blow
that
lays
bare
their
entrails
the
slaughterers
too
have
their
scruples
and
exhibit
that
moral
sense
whose
existence
in
crowds
we
have
already
pointed
out
they
refuse
to
appropriate
the
money
and
jewels
of
the
victims
taking
them
to
the
table
of
the
committees
those
rudimentary
forms
of
reasoning
characteristic
of
the
mind
of
crowds
are
always
to
be
traced
in
all
their
acts
thus
after
the
slaughter
of
the
or
enemies
of
the
nation
some
one
makes
the
remark
and
his
suggestion
is
at
once
adopted
that
the
other
prisons
those
containing
aged
beggars
vagabonds
and
young
prisoners
hold
in
reality
useless
mouths
of
which
it
would
be
well
on
that
account
to
get
rid
besides
among
them
there
should
certainly
be
enemies
of
the
people
a
woman
of
the
name
of
delarue
for
instance
the
widow
of
a
poisoner
she
must
be
furious
at
being
in
prison
if
she
could
she
would
set
fire
to
paris
she
must
have
said
so
she
has
said
so
another
good
riddance
the
demonstration
appears
convincing
and
the
prisoners
are
massacred
without
exception
included
in
the
number
being
some
fifty
children
of
from
twelve
to
seventeen
years
of
age
who
of
course
might
themselves
have
become
enemies
of
the
nation
and
of
whom
in
consequence
it
was
clearly
well
to
be
rid
at
the
end
of
a
week
work
all
these
operations
being
brought
to
an
end
the
slaughterers
can
think
of
reposing
themselves
profoundly
convinced
that
they
have
deserved
well
of
their
country
they
went
to
the
authorities
and
demanded
a
recompense

unable

here
every
category
of
jury
i
shall
only
examine
the
most
important
that
of
the
juries
of
the
court
of
assize
these
juries
afford
an
excellent
example
of
the
heterogeneous
crowd
that
is
not
anonymous
we
shall
find
them
display
suggestibility
and
but
slight
capacity
for
reasoning
while
they
are
open
to
the
influence
of
the
leaders
of
crowds
and
they
are
guided
in
the
main
by
unconscious
sentiments
in
the
course
of
this
investigation
we
shall
have
occasion
to
observe
some
interesting
examples
of
the
errors
that
may
be
made
by
persons
not
versed
in
the
psychology
of
crowds
juries
in
the
first
place
furnish
us
a
good
example
of
the
slight
importance
of
the
mental
level
of
the
different
elements
composing
a
crowd
so
far
as
the
decisions
it
comes
to
are
concerned
we
have
seen
that
when
a
deliberative
assembly
is
called
upon
to
give
its
opinion
on
a
question
of
a
character
not
entirely
technical
intelligence
stands
for
nothing
for
instance
a
gathering
of
scientific
men
or
of
artists
owing
to
the
mere
fact
that
they
form
an
assemblage
will
not
deliver
judgments
on
general
subjects
sensibly
different
from
those
rendered
by
a
gathering
of
masons
or
grocers
at
various
periods
and
in
particular
previous
to
the
french
administration
instituted
a
careful
choice
among
the
persons
summoned
to
form
a
jury
picking
the
jurors
from
among
the
enlightened
classes
choosing
professors
functionaries
men
of
letters
at
the
present
day
jurors
are
recruited
for
the
most
part
from
among
small
tradesmen
petty
capitalists
and
employes
yet
to
the
great
astonishment
of
specialist
writers
whatever
the
composition
of
the
jury
has
been
its
decisions
have
been
identical
even
the
magistrates
hostile
as
they
are
to
the
institution
of
the
jury
have
had
to
recognise
the
exactness
of
the
assertion
berard
des
glajeux
a
former
president
of
the
court
of
assizes
expresses
himself
on
the
subject
in
his
memoirs
in
the
following
terms
the
selection
of
jurymen
is
in
reality
in
the
hands
of
the
municipal
councillors
who
put
people
down
on
the
list
or
eliminate
them
from
it
in
accordance
with
the
political
and
electoral
preoccupations
inherent
in
their
situation
the
majority
of
the
jurors
chosen
are
persons
engaged
in
trade
but
persons
of
less
importance
than
formerly
and
employes
belonging
to
certain
branches
of
the
administration
both
opinions
and
professions
counting
for
nothing
once
the
role
of
judge
assumed
many
of
the
jurymen
having
the
ardour
of
neophytes
and
men
of
the
best
intentions
being
similarly
disposed
in
humble
situations
the
spirit
of
the
jury
has
not
changed
its
verdicts
have
remained
the
same
of
the
passage
just
cited
the
conclusions
which
are
just
are
to
be
borne
in
mind
and
not
the
explanations
which
are
weak
too
much
astonishment
should
not
be
felt
at
this
weakness
for
as
a
rule
counsel
equally
with
magistrates
seem
to
be
ignorant
of
the
psychology
of
crowds
and
in
consequence
of
juries
i
find
a
proof
of
this
statement
in
a
fact
related
by
the
author
just
quoted
he
remarks
that
lachaud
one
of
the
most
illustrious
barristers
practising
in
the
court
of
assize
made
systematic
use
of
his
right
to
object
to
a
juror
in
the
case
of
all
individuals
of
intelligence
on
the
list
yet
experience
and
experience
alone
has
ended
by
acquainting
us
with
the
utter
uselessness
of
these
objections
this
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
at
the
present
day
public
prosecutors
and
barristers
at
any
rate
those
belonging
to
the
parisian
bar
have
entirely
renounced
their
right
to
object
to
a
juror
still
as
des
glajeux
remarks
the
verdicts
have
not
changed
they
are
neither
better
nor
worse
like
all
crowds
juries
are
very
strongly
impressed
by
sentimental
considerations
and
very
slightly
by
argument
they
can
not
resist
the
sight
writes
a
barrister
of
a
mother
giving
its
child
the
breast
or
of
orphans
it
is
sufficient
that
a
woman
should
be
of
agreeable
appearance
says
des
glajeux
to
win
the
benevolence
of
the
jury
without
pity
for
crimes
of
which
it
appears
possible
they
might
themselves
be
the
victims
such
crimes
moreover
are
the
most
dangerous
for
society
juries
on
the
contrary
are
very
indulgent
in
the
case
of
breaches
of
the
law
whose
motive
is
passion
they
are
rarely
severe
on
infanticide
by
or
hard
on
the
young
woman
who
throws
vitriol
at
the
man
who
has
seduced
and
deserted
her
for
the
reason
that
they
feel
instinctively
that
society
runs
but
slight
danger
from
such
crimes
and
that
in
a
country
in
which
the
law
does
not
protect
deserted
girls
the
crime
of
the
girl
who
avenges
herself
is
rather
useful
than
harmful
inasmuch
as
it
frightens
future
seducers
in
advance
it
is
to
be
remarked
in
passing
that
this
division
of
crimes
into
those
dangerous
and
those
not
dangerous
for
society
which
is
well
and
instinctively
made
by
juries
is
far
from
being
unjust
the
object
of
criminal
laws
is
evidently
to
protect
society
against
dangerous
criminals
and
not
to
avenge
it
on
the
other
hand
the
french
code
and
above
all
the
minds
of
the
french
magistrates
are
still
deeply
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
vengeance
characteristic
of
the
old
primitive
law
and
the
term
vindicte
prosecution
from
the
latin
vindicta
vengeance
is
still
in
daily
use
a
proof
of
this
tendency
on
the
part
of
the
magistrates
is
found
in
the
refusal
by
many
of
them
to
apply
berenger
law
which
allows
of
a
condemned
person
not
undergoing
his
sentence
unless
he
repeats
his
crime
yet
no
magistrate
can
be
ignorant
for
the
fact
is
proved
by
statistics
that
the
application
of
a
punishment
inflicted
for
the
first
time
infallibly
leads
to
further
crime
on
the
part
of
the
person
punished
when
judges
set
free
a
sentenced
person
it
always
seems
to
them
that
society
has
not
been
avenged
rather
than
not
avenge
it
they
prefer
to
create
a
dangerous
confirmed
criminal
juries
like
all
crowds
are
profoundly
impressed
by
prestige
and
president
des
glajeux
very
properly
remarks
that
very
democratic
as
juries
are
in
their
composition
they
are
very
aristocratic
in
their
likes
and
dislikes
name
birth
great
wealth
celebrity
the
assistance
of
an
illustrious
counsel
everything
in
the
nature
of
distinction
or
that
lends
brilliancy
to
the
accused
stands
him
in
extremely
good
stead
the
chief
concern
of
a
good
counsel
should
be
to
work
upon
the
feelings
of
the
jury
and
as
with
all
crowds
to
argue
but
little
or
only
to
employ
rudimentary
modes
of
reasoning
an
english
barrister
famous
for
his
successes
in
the
assize
courts
has
well
set
forth
the
line
of
action
to
be
followed
while
pleading
he
would
attentively
observe
the
jury
the
most
favourable
opportunity
has
been
reached
by
dint
of
insight
and
experience
the
counsel
reads
the
effect
of
each
phrase
on
the
faces
of
the
jurymen
and
draws
his
conclusions
in
consequence
his
first
step
is
to
be
sure
which
members
of
the
jury
are
already
favourable
to
his
cause
it
is
short
work
to
definitely
gain
their
adhesion
and
having
done
so
he
turns
his
attention
to
the
members
who
seem
on
the
contrary
and
endeavours
to
discover
why
they
are
hostile
to
the
accused
this
is
the
delicate
part
of
his
task
for
there
may
be
an
infinity
of
reasons
for
condemning
a
man
apart
from
the
sentiment
of
justice
these
few
lines
resume
the
entire
mechanism
of
the
art
of
oratory
and
we
see
why
the
speech
prepared
in
advance
has
so
slight
an
effect
it
being
necessary
to
be
able
to
modify
the
terms
employed
from
moment
to
moment
in
accordance
with
the
impression
produced
the
orator
does
not
require
to
convert
to
his
views
all
the
members
of
a
jury
but
only
the
leading
spirits
among
it
who
will
determine
the
general
opinion
as
in
all
crowds
so
in
juries
there
are
a
small
number
of
individuals
who
serve
as
guides
to
the
rest
i
have
found
by
experience
says
the
counsel
cited
above
that
one
or
two
energetic
men
suffice
to
carry
the
rest
of
the
jury
with
them
it
is
those
two
or
three
whom
it
is
necessary
to
convince
by
skilful
suggestions
first
of
all
and
above
all
it
is
necessary
to
please
them
the
man
forming
part
of
a
crowd
whom
one
has
succeeded
in
pleasing
is
on
the
point
of
being
convinced
and
is
quite
disposed
to
accept
as
excellent
any
arguments
that
may
be
offered
him
i
detach
the
following
anecdote
from
an
interesting
account
of
lachaud
alluded
to
above
it
is
well
known
that
during
all
the
speeches
he
would
deliver
in
the
course
of
an
assize
sessions
lachaud
never
lost
sight
of
the
two
or
three
jurymen
whom
he
knew
or
felt
to
be
influential
but
obstinate
as
a
rule
he
was
successful
in
winning
over
these
refractory
jurors
on
one
occasion
however
in
the
provinces
he
had
to
deal
with
a
juryman
whom
he
plied
in
vain
for
of
an
hour
with
his
most
cunning
arguments
the
man
was
the
seventh
juryman
the
first
on
the
second
bench
the
case
was
desperate
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
a
passionate
demonstration
lachaud
stopped
short
and
addressing
the
president
of
the
court
said
you
give
instructions
for
the
curtain
there
in
front
to
be
drawn
the
seventh
juryman
is
blinded
by
the
sun
the
juryman
in
question
reddened
smiled
and
expressed
his
thanks
he
was
won
over
for
the
defence
many
writers
some
of
them
most
distinguished
have
started
of
late
a
strong
campaign
against
the
institution
of
the
jury
although
it
is
the
only
protection
we
have
against
the
errors
really
very
frequent
of
a
caste
that
is
under
no
control
a
portion
of
these
writers
advocate
a
jury
recruited
solely
from
the
ranks
of
the
enlightened
classes
but
we
have
already
proved
that
even
in
this
case
the
verdicts
would
be
identical
with
those
returned
under
the
present
system
other
writers
taking
their
stand
on
the
errors
committed
by
juries
would
abolish
the
jury
and
replace
it
by
judges
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
these
reformers
can
forget
that
the
errors
for
which
the
jury
is
blamed
were
committed
in
the
first
instance
by
judges
and
that
when
the
accused
person
comes
before
a
jury
he
has
already
been
held
to
be
guilty
by
several
magistrates
by
the
juge
the
public
prosecutor
and
the
court
of
arraignment
it
should
thus
be
clear
that
were
the
accused
to
be
definitely
judged
by
magistrates
instead
of
by
jurymen
he
would
lose
his
only
chance
of
being
admitted
innocent
the
errors
of
juries
have
always
been
first
of
all
the
errors
of
magistrates
it
is
solely
the
magistrates
then
who
should
be
blamed
when
particularly
monstrous
judicial
errors
crop
up
such
for
instance
as
the
quite
recent
condemnation
of
l
who
prosecuted
by
a
juge
of
excessive
stupidity
on
the
strength
of
the
denunciation
of
a
girl
who
accused
the
doctor
of
having
performed
an
illegal
operation
upon
her
for
thirty
francs
would
have
been
sent
to
penal
servitude
but
for
an
explosion
of
public
indignation
which
had
for
result
that
he
was
immediately
set
at
liberty
by
the
chief
of
the
state
the
honourable
character
given
the
condemned
man
by
all
his
made
the
grossness
of
the
blunder
the
magistrates
themselves
admitted
it
and
yet
out
of
caste
considerations
they
did
all
they
could
to
prevent
the
pardon
being
signed
in
all
similar
affairs
the
jury
confronted
with
technical
details
it
is
unable
to
understand
naturally
hearkens
to
the
public
prosecutor
arguing
that
after
all
the
affair
has
been
investigated
by
magistrates
trained
to
unravel
the
most
intricate
situations
who
then
are
the
real
authors
of
the
error
the
jurymen
or
the
magistrates
we
should
cling
vigorously
to
the
jury
it
constitutes
perhaps
the
only
category
of
crowd
that
can
not
be
replaced
by
any
individuality
it
alone
can
temper
the
severity
of
the
law
which
equal
for
all
ought
in
principle
to
be
blind
and
to
take
no
cognisance
of
particular
cases
inaccessible
to
pity
and
heeding
nothing
but
the
text
of
the
law
the
judge
in
his
professional
severity
would
visit
with
the
same
penalty
the
burglar
guilty
of
murder
and
the
wretched
girl
whom
poverty
and
her
abandonment
by
her
seducer
have
driven
to
infanticide
the
jury
on
the
other
hand
instinctively
feels
that
the
seduced
girl
is
much
less
guilty
than
the
seducer
who
however
is
not
touched
by
the
law
and
that
she
deserves
every
indulgence
the
magistracy
is
in
point
of
fact
the
only
administration
whose
acts
are
under
no
control
in
spite
of
all
its
revolutions
democratic
france
does
not
possess
that
right
of
habeas
corpus
of
which
england
is
so
proud
we
have
banished
all
the
tyrants
but
have
set
up
a
magistrate
in
each
city
who
disposes
at
will
of
the
honour
and
liberty
of
the
citizens
an
insignificant
juge
an
examining
magistrate
who
has
no
exact
counterpart
in
trans
fresh
from
the
university
possesses
the
revolting
power
of
sending
to
prison
at
will
persons
of
the
most
considerable
standing
on
a
simple
supposition
on
his
part
of
their
guilt
and
without
being
obliged
to
justify
his
act
to
any
one
under
the
pretext
of
pursuing
his
investigation
he
can
keep
these
persons
in
prison
for
six
months
or
even
a
year
and
free
them
at
last
without
owing
them
either
an
indemnity
or
excuses
the
warrant
in
france
is
the
exact
equivalent
of
the
lettre
de
cachet
with
this
difference
that
the
latter
with
the
use
of
which
the
monarchy
was
so
justly
reproached
could
only
be
resorted
to
by
persons
occupying
a
very
high
position
while
the
warrant
is
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
a
whole
class
of
citizens
which
is
far
from
passing
for
being
very
enlightened
or
very
independent
being
well
acquainted
with
the
psychology
of

and
also
with
the
psychology

i
do
not
perceive
a

case
in
which
wrongly
accused
of
a
crime
i
should
not
prefer
to
have
to

i

action
is
confined
to
a
single
clearly
determined
matter
namely
to
choosing
between
different
candidates
they
present
only
a
few
of
the
characteristics
previously
described
of
the
characteristics
peculiar
to
crowds
they
display
in
particular
but
slight
aptitude
for
reasoning
the
absence
of
the
critical
spirit
irritability
credulity
and
simplicity
in
their
decision
moreover
is
to
be
traced
the
influence
of
the
leaders
of
crowds
and
the
part
played
by
the
factors
we
have
enumerated
affirmation
repetition
prestige
and
contagion
let
us
examine
by
what
methods
electoral
crowds
are
to
be
persuaded
it
will
be
easy
to
deduce
their
psychology
from
the
methods
that
are
most
successful
it
is
of
primary
importance
that
the
candidate
should
possess
prestige
personal
prestige
can
only
be
replaced
by
that
resulting
from
wealth
talent
and
even
genius
are
not
elements
of
success
of
serious
importance
of
capital
importance
on
the
other
hand
is
the
necessity
for
the
candidate
of
possessing
prestige
of
being
able
that
is
to
force
himself
upon
the
electorate
without
discussion
the
reason
why
the
electors
of
whom
a
majority
are
working
men
or
peasants
so
rarely
choose
a
man
from
their
own
ranks
to
represent
them
is
that
such
a
person
enjoys
no
prestige
among
them
when
by
chance
they
do
elect
a
man
who
is
their
equal
it
is
as
a
rule
for
subsidiary
reasons
for
instance
to
spite
an
eminent
man
or
an
influential
employer
of
labour
on
whom
the
elector
is
in
daily
dependence
and
whose
master
he
has
the
illusion
he
becomes
in
this
way
for
a
moment
the
possession
of
prestige
does
not
suffice
however
to
assure
the
success
of
a
candidate
the
elector
stickles
in
particular
for
the
flattery
of
his
greed
and
vanity
he
must
be
overwhelmed
with
the
most
extravagant
blandishments
and
there
must
be
no
hesitation
in
making
him
the
most
fantastic
promises
if
he
is
a
working
man
it
is
impossible
to
go
too
far
in
insulting
and
stigmatising
employers
of
labour
as
for
the
rival
candidate
an
effort
must
be
made
to
destroy
his
chance
by
establishing
by
dint
of
affirmation
repetition
and
contagion
that
he
is
an
arrant
scoundrel
and
that
it
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
he
has
been
guilty
of
several
crimes
it
is
of
course
useless
to
trouble
about
any
semblance
of
proof
should
the
adversary
be
with
the
psychology
of
crowds
he
will
try
to
justify
himself
by
arguments
instead
of
confining
himself
to
replying
to
one
set
of
affirmations
by
another
and
he
will
have
no
chance
whatever
of
being
successful
the
candidate
written
programme
should
not
be
too
categorical
since
later
on
his
adversaries
might
bring
it
up
against
him
in
his
verbal
programme
however
there
can
not
be
too
much
exaggeration
the
most
important
reforms
may
be
fearlessly
promised
at
the
moment
they
are
made
these
exaggerations
produce
a
great
effect
and
they
are
not
binding
for
the
future
it
being
a
matter
of
constant
observation
that
the
elector
never
troubles
himself
to
know
how
far
the
candidate
he
has
returned
has
followed
out
the
electoral
programme
he
applauded
and
in
virtue
of
which
the
election
was
supposed
to
have
been
secured
in
what
precedes
all
the
factors
of
persuasion
which
we
have
described
are
to
be
recognised
we
shall
come
across
them
again
in
the
action
exerted
by
words
and
formulas
whose
magical
sway
we
have
already
insisted
upon
an
orator
who
knows
how
to
make
use
of
these
means
of
persuasion
can
do
what
he
will
with
a
crowd
expressions
such
as
infamous
capital
vile
exploiters
the
admirable
working
man
the
socialisation
of
wealth
always
produce
the
same
effect
although
already
somewhat
worn
by
use
but
the
candidate
who
hits
on
a
new
formula
as
devoid
as
possible
of
precise
meaning
and
apt
in
consequence
to
flatter
the
most
varied
aspirations
infallibly
obtains
a
success
the
sanguinary
spanish
revolution
of
was
brought
about
by
one
of
these
magical
phrases
of
complex
meaning
on
which
everybody
can
put
his
own
interpretation
a
contemporary
writer
has
described
the
launching
of
this
phrase
in
terms
that
deserve
to
be
quoted
the
radicals
have
made
the
discovery
that
a
centralised
republic
is
a
monarchy
in
disguise
and
to
humour
them
the
cortes
had
unanimously
proclaimed
a
federal
republic
though
none
of
the
voters
could
have
explained
what
it
was
he
had
just
voted
for
this
formula
however
delighted
everybody
the
joy
was
intoxicating
delirious
the
reign
of
virtue
and
happiness
had
just
been
inaugurated
on
earth
a
republican
whose
opponent
refused
him
the
title
of
federalist
considered
himself
to
be
mortally
insulted
people
addressed
each
other
in
the
streets
with
the
words
live
the
federal
republic
after
which
the
praises
were
sung
of
the
mystic
virtue
of
the
absence
of
discipline
in
the
army
and
of
the
autonomy
of
the
soldiers
what
was
understood
by
the
republic
there
were
those
who
took
it
to
mean
the
emancipation
of
the
provinces
institutions
akin
to
those
of
the
united
states
and
administrative
decentralisation
others
had
in
view
the
abolition
of
all
authority
and
the
speedy
commencement
of
the
great
social
liquidation
the
socialists
of
barcelona
and
andalusia
stood
out
for
the
absolute
sovereignty
of
the
communes
they
proposed
to
endow
spain
with
ten
thousand
independent
municipalities
to
legislate
on
their
own
account
and
their
creation
to
be
accompanied
by
the
suppression
of
the
police
and
the
army
in
the
southern
provinces
the
insurrection
was
soon
seen
to
spread
from
town
to
town
and
village
to
village
directly
a
village
had
made
its
pronunciamento
its
first
care
was
to
destroy
the
telegraph
wires
and
the
railway
lines
so
as
to
cut
off
all
communication
with
its
neighbours
and
madrid
the
sorriest
hamlet
was
determined
to
stand
on
its
own
bottom
federation
had
given
place
to
cantonalism
marked
by
massacres
incendiarism
and
every
description
of
brutality
and
bloody
saturnalia
were
celebrated
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
with
respect
to
the
influence
that
may
be
exerted
by
reasoning
on
the
minds
of
electors
to
harbour
the
least
doubt
on
this
subject
can
only
be
the
result
of
never
having
read
the
reports
of
an
electioneering
meeting
in
such
a
gathering
affirmations
invectives
and
sometimes
blows
are
exchanged
but
never
arguments
should
silence
be
established
for
a
moment
it
is
because
some
one
present
having
the
reputation
of
a
tough
customer
has
announced
that
he
is
about
to
heckle
the
candidate
by
putting
him
one
of
those
embarrassing
questions
which
are
always
the
joy
of
the
audience
the
satisfaction
however
of
the
opposition
party
is
shortlived
for
the
voice
of
the
questioner
is
soon
drowned
in
the
uproar
made
by
his
adversaries
the
following
reports
of
public
meetings
chosen
from
hundreds
of
similar
examples
and
taken
from
the
daily
papers
may
be
considered
as
typical
one
of
the
organisers
of
the
meeting
having
asked
the
assembly
to
elect
a
president
the
storm
bursts
the
anarchists
leap
on
to
the
platform
to
take
the
committee
table
by
storm
the
socialists
make
an
energetic
defence
blows
are
exchanged
and
each
party
accuses
the
other
of
being
spies
in
the
pay
of
the
government
a
citizen
leaves
the
hall
with
a
black
eye
the
committee
is
at
length
installed
as
best
it
may
be
in
the
midst
of
the
tumult
and
the
right
to
speak
devolves
upon
x
the
orator
starts
a
vigorous
attack
on
the
socialists
who
interrupt
him
with
shouts
of
scoundrel
blackguard
epithets
to
which
comrade
replies
by
setting
forth
a
theory
according
to
which
the
socialists
are
or
the
allemanist
party
had
organised
yesterday
evening
in
the
hall
of
commerce
in
the
rue
du
a
great
meeting
preliminary
to
the
workers
fete
of
the
of
may
the
watchword
of
the
meeting
was
and
tranquillity
comrade
g
alludes
to
the
socialists
as
and
at
these
words
there
is
an
exchange
of
invectives
and
orators
and
audience
come
to
blows
chairs
tables
and
benches
are
converted
into
weapons
it
is
not
to
be
imagined
for
a
moment
that
this
description
of
discussion
is
peculiar
to
a
determined
class
of
electors
and
dependent
on
their
social
position
in
every
anonymous
assembly
whatever
though
it
be
composed
exclusively
of
highly
educated
persons
discussion
always
assumes
the
same
shape
i
have
shown
that
when
men
are
collected
in
a
crowd
there
is
a
tendency
towards
their
mental
levelling
at
work
and
proof
of
this
is
to
be
found
at
every
turn
take
for
example
the
following
extract
from
a
report
of
a
meeting
composed
exclusively
of
students
which
i
borrow
from
the
temps
of
of
february
the
tumult
only
increased
as
the
evening
went
on
i
do
not
believe
that
a
single
orator
succeeded
in
uttering
two
sentences
without
being
interrupted
at
every
instant
there
came
shouts
from
this
or
that
direction
or
from
every
direction
at
once
applause
was
intermingled
with
hissing
violent
discussions
were
in
progress
between
individual
members
of
the
audience
sticks
were
brandished
threateningly
others
beat
a
tattoo
on
the
floor
and
the
interrupters
were
greeted
with
yells
of
him
out
or
him
speak
c
lavished
such
epithets
as
odious
and
cowardly
monstrous
vile
venal
and
vindictive
on
the
association
which
he
declared
he
wanted
to
destroy
how
it
may
be
asked
can
an
elector
form
an
opinion
under
such
conditions
to
put
such
a
question
is
to
harbour
a
strange
delusion
as
to
the
measure
of
liberty
that
may
be
enjoyed
by
a
collectivity
crowds
have
opinions
that
have
been
imposed
upon
them
but
they
never
boast
reasoned
opinions
in
the
case
under
consideration
the
opinions
and
votes
of
the
electors
are
in
the
hands
of
the
election
committees
whose
leading
spirits
are
as
a
rule
publicans
their
influence
over
the
working
men
to
whom
they
allow
credit
being
great
do
you
know
what
an
election
committee
is
writes
scherer
one
of
the
most
valiant
champions
of
democracy
it
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
of
our
institutions
the
masterpiece
of
the
political
machine
france
is
governed
by
the
election
committees
committees
under
whatever
name
clubs
syndicates
constitute
perhaps
the
most
redoubtable
danger
resulting
from
the
power
of
crowds
they
represent
in
reality
the
most
impersonal
and
in
consequence
the
most
oppressive
form
of
tyranny
the
leaders
who
direct
the
committees
being
supposed
to
speak
and
act
in
the
name
of
a
collectivity
are
freed
from
all
responsibility
and
are
in
a
position
to
do
just
as
they
choose
the
most
savage
tyrant
has
never
ventured
even
to
dream
of
such
proscriptions
as
those
ordained
by
the
committees
of
the
revolution
barras
has
declared
that
they
decimated
the
convention
picking
off
its
members
at
their
pleasure
so
long
as
he
was
able
to
speak
in
their
name
robespierre
wielded
absolute
power
the
moment
this
frightful
dictator
separated
himself
from
them
for
reasons
of
personal
pride
he
was
lost
the
reign
of
crowds
is
the
reign
of
committees
that
is
of
the
leaders
of
crowds
a
severer
despotism
can
not
be
imagined
to
exert
an
influence
over
them
is
not
difficult
provided
the
candidate
be
in
himself
acceptable
and
possess
adequate
financial
resources
according
to
the
admissions
of
the
donors
three
millions
of
francs
sufficed
to
secure
the
repeated
elections
of
general
boulanger
such
is
the
psychology
of
electoral
crowds
it
is
identical
with
that
of
other
crowds
neither
better
nor
worse
in
consequence
i
draw
no
conclusion
against
universal
suffrage
from
what
precedes
had
i
to
settle
its
fate
i
should
preserve
it
as
it
is
for
practical
reasons
which
are
to
be
deduced
in
point
of
fact
from
our
investigation
of
the
psychology
of
crowds
on
this
account
i
shall
proceed
to
set
them
forth
no
doubt
the
weak
side
of
universal
suffrage
is
too
obvious
to
be
overlooked
it
can
not
be
gainsaid
that
civilisation
has
been
the
work
of
a
small
minority
of
superior
intelligences
constituting
the
culminating
point
of
a
pyramid
whose
stages
widening
in
proportion
to
the
decrease
of
mental
power
represent
the
masses
of
a
nation
the
greatness
of
a
civilisation
can
not
assuredly
depend
upon
the
votes
given
by
inferior
elements
boasting
solely
numerical
strength
doubtless
too
the
votes
recorded
by
crowds
are
often
very
dangerous
they
have
already
cost
us
several
invasions
and
in
view
of
the
triumph
of
socialism
for
which
they
are
preparing
the
way
it
is
probable
that
the
vagaries
of
popular
sovereignty
will
cost
us
still
more
dearly
excellent
however
as
these
objections
are
in
theory
in
practice
they
lose
all
force
as
will
be
admitted
if
the
invincible
strength
be
remembered
of
ideas
transformed
into
dogmas
the
dogma
of
the
sovereignty
of
crowds
is
as
little
defensible
from
the
philosophical
point
of
view
as
the
religious
dogmas
of
the
middle
ages
but
it
enjoys
at
present
the
same
absolute
power
they
formerly
enjoyed
it
is
as
unattackable
in
consequence
as
in
the
past
were
our
religious
ideas
imagine
a
modern
freethinker
miraculously
transported
into
the
midst
of
the
middle
ages
do
you
suppose
that
after
having
ascertained
the
sovereign
power
of
the
religious
ideas
that
were
then
in
force
he
would
have
been
tempted
to
attack
them
having
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
judge
disposed
to
send
him
to
the
stake
under
the
imputation
of
having
concluded
a
pact
with
the
devil
or
of
having
been
present
at
the
witches
sabbath
would
it
have
occurred
to
him
to
call
in
question
the
existence
of
the
devil
or
of
the
sabbath
it
were
as
wise
to
oppose
cyclones
with
discussion
as
the
beliefs
of
crowds
the
dogma
of
universal
suffrage
possesses
the
power
the
christian
dogmas
formerly
possessed
orators
and
writers
allude
to
it
with
a
respect
and
adulation
that
never
fell
to
the
share
of
louis
xiv
in
consequence
the
same
position
must
be
taken
up
with
regard
to
it
as
with
regard
to
all
religious
dogmas
time
alone
can
act
upon
them
besides
it
would
be
the
more
useless
to
attempt
to
undermine
this
dogma
inasmuch
as
it
has
an
appearance
of
reasonableness
in
its
favour
in
an
era
of
equality
tocqueville
justly
remarks
men
have
no
faith
in
each
other
on
account
of
their
being
all
alike
yet
this
same
similitude
gives
them
an
almost
limitless
confidence
in
the
judgment
of
the
public
the
reason
being
that
it
does
not
appear
probable
that
all
men
being
equally
enlightened
truth
and
numerical
superiority
should
not
go
hand
in
hand
must
it
be
believed
that
with
a
restricted
suffrage
a
suffrage
restricted
to
those
intellectually
capable
if
it
be
desired
an
improvement
would
be
effected
in
the
votes
of
crowds
i
can
not
admit
for
a
moment
that
this
would
be
the
case
and
that
for
the
reasons
i
have
already
given
touching
the
mental
inferiority
of
all
collectivities
whatever
their
composition
in
a
crowd
men
always
tend
to
the
same
level
and
on
general
questions
a
vote
recorded
by
forty
academicians
is
no
better
than
that
of
forty
i
do
not
in
the
least
believe
that
any
of
the
votes
for
which
universal
suffrage
is
blamed
the
of
the
empire
for
instance
would
have
fallen
out
differently
had
the
voters
been
exclusively
recruited
among
learned
and
liberally
educated
men
it
does
not
follow
because
an
individual
knows
greek
or
mathematics
is
an
architect
a
veterinary
surgeon
a
doctor
or
a
barrister
that
he
is
endowed
with
a
special
intelligence
of
social
questions
all
our
political
economists
are
highly
educated
being
for
the
most
part
professors
or
academicians
yet
is
there
a
single
general
question
protection
bimetallism
on
which
they
have
succeeded
in
agreeing
the
explanation
is
that
their
science
is
only
a
very
attenuated
form
of
our
universal
ignorance
with
regard
to
social
problems
owing
to
the
number
of
unknown
quantities
they
offer
men
are
substantially
equally
ignorant
in
consequence
were
the
electorate
solely
composed
of
persons
stuffed
with
sciences
their
votes
would
be
no
better
than
those
emitted
at
present
they
would
be
guided
in
the
main
by
their
sentiments
and
by
party
spirit
we
should
be
spared
none
of
the
difficulties
we
now
have
to
contend
with
and
we
should
certainly
be
subjected
to
the
oppressive
tyranny
of
castes
whether
the
suffrage
of
crowds
be
restricted
or
general
whether
it
be
exercised
under
a
republic
or
a
monarchy
in
france
in
belgium
in
greece
in
portugal
or
in
spain
it
is
everywhere
identical
and
when
all
is
said
and
done
it
is
the
expression
of
the
unconscious
aspirations
and
needs
of
the
race
in
each
country
the
average
opinions
of
those
elected
represent
the
genius
of
the
race
and
they
will
be
found
not
to
alter
sensibly
from
one
generation
to
another
it
is
seen
then
that
we
are
confronted
once
more
by
the
fundamental
notion
of
race
which
we
have
come
across
so
often
and
on
this
other
notion
which
is
the
outcome
of
the
first
that
institutions
and
governments
play
but
a
small
part
in
the
life
of
a
people
peoples
are
guided
in
the
main
by
the
genius
of
their
race
that
is
by
that
inherited
residue
of
qualities
of
which
the
genius
is
the
sum
total
race
and
the
slavery
of
our
daily
necessities
are
the
mysterious
that
rule

chapter
v
parliamentary
assemblies
parliamentary
crowds
present
most
of
the
characteristics
common
to
heterogeneous
crowds
that
are
not
anonymous
the
simplicity
of
their
opinions
their
suggestibility
and
its
limits
their
indestructible
fixed
opinions
and
their
changed
opinions
the
reason
of
the
predominance
of
indecision
the
role
of
the
leaders
the
reason
of
their
prestige
they
are
the
true
masters
of
an
assembly
whose
votes
on
that
account
are
merely
those
of
a
small
minority
the
absolute
power
they
exercise
the
elements
of
their
oratorical
art
phrases
and
images
the
psychological
necessity
the
leaders
are
under
of
being
in
a
general
way
of
stubborn
convictions
and
it
is
impossible
for
a
speaker
without
prestige
to
obtain
recognition
for
his
arguments
the
exaggeration
of
the
sentiments
whether
good
or
bad
of
assemblies
at
certain
moments
they
become
automatic
the
sittings
of
the
convention
cases
in
which
an
assembly
loses
the
characteristics
of
crowds
the
influence
of
specialists
when
technical
questions
arise
the
advantages
and
dangers
of
a
parliamentary
system
in
all
countries
it
is
adapted
to
modern
needs
but
it
involves
financial
waste
and
the
progressive
curtailment
of
all
liberty
conclusion
in
parliamentary
assemblies
we
have
an
example
of
heterogeneous
crowds
that
are
not
anonymous
although
the
mode
of
election
of
their
members
varies
from
epoch
to
epoch
and
from
nation
to
nation
they
present
very
similar
characteristics
in
this
case
the
influence
of
the
race
makes
itself
felt
to
weaken
or
exaggerate
the
characteristics
common
to
crowds
but
not
to
prevent
their
manifestation
the
parliamentary
assemblies
of
the
most
widely
different
countries
of
greece
italy
portugal
spain
france
and
america
present
great
analogies
in
their
debates
and
votes
and
leave
the
respective
governments
face
to
face
with
identical
difficulties
moreover
the
parliamentary
system
represents
the
ideal
of
all
modern
civilised
peoples
the
system
is
the
expression
of
the
idea
psychologically
erroneous
but
generally
admitted
that
a
large
gathering
of
men
is
much
more
capable
than
a
small
number
of
coming
to
a
wise
and
independent
decision
on
a
given
subject
the
general
characteristics
of
crowds
are
to
be
met
with
in
parliamentary
assemblies
intellectual
simplicity
irritability
suggestibility
the
exaggeration
of
the
sentiments
and
the
preponderating
influence
of
a
few
leaders
in
consequence
however
of
their
special
composition
parliamentary
crowds
offer
some
distinctive
features
which
we
shall
point
out
shortly
simplicity
in
their
opinions
is
one
of
their
most
important
characteristics
in
the
case
of
all
parties
and
more
especially
so
far
as
the
latin
peoples
are
concerned
an
invariable
tendency
is
met
with
in
crowds
of
this
kind
to
solve
the
most
complicated
social
problems
by
the
simplest
abstract
principles
and
general
laws
applicable
to
all
cases
naturally
the
principles
vary
with
the
party
but
owing
to
the
mere
fact
that
the
individual
members
are
a
part
of
a
crowd
they
are
always
inclined
to
exaggerate
the
worth
of
their
principles
and
to
push
them
to
their
extreme
consequences
in
consequence
parliaments
are
more
especially
representative
of
extreme
opinions
the
most
perfect
example
of
the
ingenuous
simplification
of
opinions
peculiar
to
assemblies
is
offered
by
the
jacobins
of
the
french
revolution
dogmatic
and
logical
to
a
man
and
their
brains
full
of
vague
generalities
they
busied
themselves
with
the
application
of
without
concerning
themselves
with
events
it
has
been
said
of
them
with
reason
that
they
went
through
the
revolution
without
witnessing
it
with
the
aid
of
the
very
simple
dogmas
that
served
them
as
guide
they
imagined
they
could
recast
society
from
top
to
bottom
and
cause
a
highly
refined
civilisation
to
return
to
a
very
anterior
phase
of
the
social
evolution
the
methods
they
resorted
to
to
realise
their
dream
wore
the
same
stamp
of
absolute
ingenuousness
they
confined
themselves
in
reality
to
destroying
what
stood
in
their
way
all
of
them
moreover
girondists
the
men
of
the
mountain
the
thermidorians
were
alike
animated
by
the
same
spirit
parliamentary
crowds
are
very
open
to
suggestion
and
as
in
the
case
of
all
crowds
the
suggestion
comes
from
leaders
possessing
prestige
but
the
suggestibility
of
parliamentary
assemblies
has
very
clearly
defined
limits
which
it
is
important
to
point
out
on
all
questions
of
local
or
regional
interest
every
member
of
an
assembly
has
fixed
unalterable
opinions
which
no
amount
of
argument
can
shake
the
talent
of
a
demosthenes
would
be
powerless
to
change
the
vote
of
a
deputy
on
such
questions
as
protection
or
the
privilege
of
distilling
alcohol
questions
in
which
the
interests
of
influential
electors
are
involved
the
suggestion
emanating
from
these
electors
and
undergone
before
the
time
to
vote
arrives
sufficiently
outweighs
suggestions
from
any
other
source
to
annul
them
and
to
maintain
an
absolute
fixity
of
opinion
the
following
reflection
of
an
english
parliamentarian
of
long
experience
doubtless
applies
to
these
opinions
fixed
beforehand
and
rendered
unalterable
by
electioneering
necessities
during
the
fifty
years
that
i
have
sat
at
westminster
i
have
listened
to
thousands
of
speeches
but
few
of
them
have
changed
my
opinion
not
one
of
them
has
changed
my
vote
on
general
questions
the
overthrow
of
a
cabinet
the
imposition
of
a
tax
there
is
no
longer
any
fixity
of
opinion
and
the
suggestions
of
leaders
can
exert
an
influence
though
not
in
quite
the
same
way
as
in
an
ordinary
crowd
every
party
has
its
leaders
who
possess
occasionally
an
equal
influence
the
result
is
that
the
deputy
finds
himself
placed
between
two
contrary
suggestions
and
is
inevitably
made
to
hesitate
this
explains
how
it
is
that
he
is
often
seen
to
vote
in
contrary
fashion
in
an
interval
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
to
add
to
a
law
an
article
which
nullifies
it
for
instance
to
withdraw
from
employers
of
labour
the
right
of
choosing
and
dismissing
their
workmen
and
then
to
very
nearly
annul
this
measure
by
an
amendment
it
is
for
the
same
reason
that
every
chamber
that
is
returned
has
some
very
stable
opinions
and
other
opinions
that
are
very
shifting
on
the
whole
the
general
questions
being
the
more
numerous
indecision
is
predominant
in
the
chamber
the
indecision
which
results
from
the
present
fear
of
the
elector
the
suggestion
received
from
whom
is
always
latent
and
tends
to
counterbalance
the
influence
of
the
leaders
still
it
is
the
leaders
who
are
definitely
the
masters
in
those
numerous
discussions
with
regard
to
the
of
which
the
members
of
an
assembly
are
without
strong
preconceived
opinions
the
necessity
for
these
leaders
is
evident
since
under
the
name
of
heads
of
groups
they
are
met
with
in
the
assemblies
of
every
country
they
are
the
real
rulers
of
an
assembly
men
forming
a
crowd
can
not
do
without
a
master
whence
it
results
that
the
votes
of
an
assembly
only
represent
as
a
rule
the
opinions
of
a
small
minority
the
influence
of
the
leaders
is
due
in
very
small
measure
to
the
arguments
they
employ
but
in
a
large
degree
to
their
prestige
the
best
proof
of
this
is
that
should
they
by
any
circumstance
lose
their
prestige
their
influence
disappears
the
prestige
of
these
political
leaders
is
individual
and
independent
of
name
or
celebrity
a
fact
of
which
jules
simon
gives
us
some
very
curious
examples
in
his
remarks
on
the
prominent
men
of
the
assembly
of
of
which
he
was
a
member
two
months
before
he
was
louis
napoleon
was
entirely
without
the
least
importance
victor
hugo
mounted
the
tribune
he
failed
to
achieve
success
he
was
listened
to
as
felix
pyat
was
listened
to
but
he
did
not
obtain
as
much
applause
do
like
his
ideas
vaulabelle
said
to
me
speaking
of
felix
pyat
but
he
is
one
of
the
greatest
writers
and
the
greatest
orator
of
france
edgar
quinet
in
spite
of
his
exceptional
and
powerful
intelligence
was
held
in
no
esteem
whatever
he
had
been
popular
for
awhile
before
the
opening
of
the
assembly
in
the
assembly
he
had
no
popularity
the
splendour
of
genius
makes
itself
less
felt
in
political
assemblies
than
anywhere
else
they
only
give
heed
to
eloquence
appropriate
to
the
time
and
place
and
to
party
services
not
to
services
rendered
the
country
for
homage
to
be
rendered
lamartine
in
and
thiers
in
the
stimulant
was
needed
of
urgent
inexorable
interest
as
soon
as
the
danger
was
passed
the
parliamentary
world
forgot
in
the
same
instant
its
gratitude
and
its
fright
i
have
quoted
the
preceding
passage
for
the
sake
of
the
facts
it
contains
not
of
the
explanations
it
offers
their
psychology
being
somewhat
poor
a
crowd
would
at
once
lose
its
character
of
a
crowd
were
it
to
credit
its
leaders
with
their
services
whether
of
a
party
nature
or
rendered
their
country
the
crowd
that
obeys
a
leader
is
under
the
influence
of
his
prestige
and
its
submission
is
not
dictated
by
any
sentiment
of
interest
or
gratitude
in
consequence
the
leader
endowed
with
sufficient
prestige
wields
almost
absolute
power
the
immense
influence
exerted
during
a
long
series
of
years
thanks
to
his
prestige
by
a
celebrated
deputy
beaten
at
the
last
general
election
in
consequence
of
certain
financial
events
is
well
known
he
had
only
to
give
the
signal
and
cabinets
were
overthrown
a
writer
has
clearly
indicated
the
scope
of
his
action
in
the
following
lines
m
note
of
the
translator
it
is
due
in
the
main
to
x
that
we
paid
three
times
as
dearly
as
we
should
have
done
for
tonkin
that
we
remained
so
long
on
a
precarious
footing
in
madagascar
that
we
were
defrauded
of
an
empire
in
the
region
of
the
lower
niger
and
that
we
have
lost
the
preponderating
situation
we
used
to
occupy
in
egypt
the
theories
of
x
have
cost
us
more
territories
than
the
disasters
of
napoleon
i
we
must
not
harbour
too
bitter
a
grudge
against
the
leader
in
question
it
is
plain
that
he
has
cost
us
very
dear
but
a
great
part
of
his
influence
was
due
to
the
fact
that
he
followed
public
opinion
which
in
colonial
matters
was
far
from
being
at
the
time
what
it
has
since
become
a
leader
is
seldom
in
advance
of
public
opinion
almost
always
all
he
does
is
to
follow
it
and
to
espouse
all
its
errors
the
means
of
persuasion
of
the
leaders
we
are
dealing
with
apart
from
their
prestige
consist
in
the
factors
we
have
already
enumerated
several
times
to
make
a
skilful
use
of
these
resources
a
leader
must
have
arrived
at
a
comprehension
at
least
in
an
unconscious
manner
of
the
psychology
of
crowds
and
must
know
how
to
address
them
he
should
be
aware
in
particular
of
the
fascinating
influence
of
words
phrases
and
images
he
should
possess
a
special
description
of
eloquence
composed
of
energetic
affirmations
unburdened
with
proofs
and
impressive
images
accompanied
by
very
summary
arguments
this
is
a
kind
of
eloquence
that
is
met
with
in
all
assemblies
the
english
parliament
included
the
most
serious
though
it
is
of
all
debates
in
the
house
of
commons
says
the
english
philosopher
maine
may
be
constantly
read
in
which
the
entire
discussion
is
confined
to
an
exchange
of
rather
weak
generalities
and
rather
violent
personalities
general
formulas
of
this
description
exercise
a
prodigious
influence
on
the
imagination
of
a
pure
democracy
it
will
always
be
easy
to
make
a
crowd
accept
general
assertions
presented
in
striking
terms
although
they
have
never
been
verified
and
are
perhaps
not
susceptible
of
verification
too
much
importance
can
not
be
attached
to
the
striking
terms
alluded
to
in
the
above
quotation
we
have
already
insisted
on
several
occasions
on
the
special
power
of
words
and
formulas
they
must
be
chosen
in
such
a
way
as
to
evoke
very
vivid
images
the
following
phrase
taken
from
a
speech
by
one
of
the
leaders
of
our
assemblies
affords
an
excellent
example
when
the
same
vessel
shall
bear
away
to
the
lands
of
our
penitentiary
settlements
the
politician
of
shady
reputation
and
the
anarchist
guilty
of
murder
the
pair
will
be
able
to
converse
together
and
they
will
appear
to
each
other
as
the
two
complementary
aspects
of
one
and
the
same
state
of
society
the
image
thus
evoked
is
very
vivid
and
all
the
adversaries
of
the
speaker
felt
themselves
threatened
by
it
they
conjured
up
a
double
vision
of
the
country
and
the
vessel
that
may
carry
them
away
for
is
it
not
possible
that
they
are
included
in
the
somewhat
category
of
the
politicians
menaced
they
experienced
the
lurking
fear
that
the
men
of
the
convention
must
have
felt
whom
the
vague
speeches
of
robespierre
threatened
with
the
guillotine
and
who
under
the
influence
of
this
fear
invariably
yielded
to
him
it
is
all
to
the
interest
of
the
leaders
to
indulge
in
the
most
improbable
exaggerations
the
speaker
of
whom
i
have
just
cited
a
sentence
was
able
to
affirm
without
arousing
violent
protestations
that
bankers
and
priests
had
subsidised
the
throwers
of
bombs
and
that
the
directors
of
the
great
financial
companies
deserve
the
same
punishment
as
anarchists
affirmations
of
this
kind
are
always
effective
with
crowds
the
affirmation
is
never
too
violent
the
declamation
never
too
threatening
nothing
intimidates
the
audience
more
than
this
sort
of
eloquence
those
present
are
afraid
that
if
they
protest
they
will
be
put
down
as
traitors
or
accomplices
as
i
have
said
this
peculiar
style
of
eloquence
has
ever
been
of
sovereign
effect
in
all
assemblies
in
times
of
crisis
its
power
is
still
further
accentuated
the
speeches
of
the
great
orators
of
the
assemblies
of
the
french
revolution
are
very
interesting
reading
from
this
point
of
view
at
every
instant
they
thought
themselves
obliged
to
pause
in
order
to
denounce
crime
and
exalt
virtue
after
which
they
would
burst
forth
into
imprecations
against
tyrants
and
swear
to
live
free
men
or
perish
those
present
rose
to
their
feet
applauded
furiously
and
then
calmed
took
their
seats
again
on
occasion
the
leader
may
be
intelligent
and
highly
educated
but
the
possession
of
these
qualities
does
him
as
a
rule
more
harm
than
good
by
showing
how
complex
things
are
by
allowing
of
explanation
and
promoting
comprehension
intelligence
always
renders
its
owner
indulgent
and
blunts
in
a
large
measure
that
intensity
and
violence
of
conviction
needful
for
apostles
the
great
leaders
of
crowds
of
all
ages
and
those
of
the
revolution
in
particular
have
been
of
lamentably
narrow
intellect
while
it
is
precisely
those
whose
intelligence
has
been
the
most
restricted
who
have
exercised
the
greatest
influence
the
speeches
of
the
most
celebrated
of
them
of
robespierre
frequently
astound
one
by
their
incoherence
by
merely
reading
them
no
plausible
explanation
is
to
be
found
of
the
great
part
played
by
the
powerful
dictator
the
commonplaces
and
redundancies
of
pedagogic
eloquence
and
latin
culture
at
the
service
of
a
mind
childish
rather
than
undistinguished
and
limited
in
its
notions
of
attack
and
defence
to
the
defiant
attitude
of
schoolboys
not
an
idea
not
a
happy
turn
of
phrase
or
a
telling
hit
a
storm
of
declamation
that
leaves
us
bored
after
a
dose
of
this
unexhilarating
reading
one
is
attempted
to
exclaim
with
the
amiable
camille
desmoulins
it
is
terrible
at
times
to
think
of
the
power
that
strong
conviction
combined
with
extreme
narrowness
of
mind
gives
a
man
possessing
prestige
it
is
none
the
less
necessary
that
these
conditions
should
be
satisfied
for
a
man
to
ignore
obstacles
and
display
strength
of
will
in
a
high
measure
crowds
instinctively
recognise
in
men
of
energy
and
conviction
the
masters
they
are
always
in
need
of
in
a
parliamentary
assembly
the
success
of
a
speech
depends
almost
solely
on
the
prestige
possessed
by
the
speaker
and
not
at
all
on
the
arguments
he
brings
forward
the
best
proof
of
this
is
that
when
for
one
cause
or
another
a
speaker
loses
his
prestige
he
loses
simultaneously
all
his
influence
that
is
his
power
of
influencing
votes
at
will
when
an
unknown
speaker
comes
forward
with
a
speech
containing
good
arguments
but
only
arguments
the
chances
are
that
he
will
only
obtain
a
hearing
a
deputy
who
is
a
psychologist
of
insight
desaubes
has
recently
traced
in
the
following
lines
the
portrait
of
the
deputy
who
lacks
prestige
when
he
takes
his
place
in
the
tribune
he
draws
a
document
from
his
portfolio
spreads
it
out
methodically
before
him
and
makes
a
start
with
assurance
he
flatters
himself
that
he
will
implant
in
the
minds
of
his
audience
the
conviction
by
which
he
is
himself
animated
he
has
weighed
and
reweighed
his
arguments
he
is
well
primed
with
figures
and
proofs
he
is
certain
he
will
convince
his
hearers
in
the
face
of
the
evidence
he
is
to
adduce
all
resistance
would
be
futile
he
begins
confident
in
the
justice
of
his
cause
and
relying
upon
the
attention
of
his
colleagues
whose
only
anxiety
of
course
is
to
subscribe
to
the
truth
he
speaks
and
is
at
once
surprised
at
the
restlessness
of
the
house
and
a
little
annoyed
by
the
noise
that
is
being
made
how
is
it
silence
is
not
kept
why
this
general
inattention
what
are
those
deputies
thinking
about
who
are
engaged
in
conversation
what
urgent
motive
has
induced
this
or
that
deputy
to
quit
his
seat
an
expression
of
uneasiness
crosses
his
face
he
frowns
and
stops
encouraged
by
the
president
he
begins
again
raising
his
voice
he
is
only
listened
to
all
the
less
he
lends
emphasis
to
his
words
and
gesticulates
the
noise
around
him
increases
he
can
no
longer
hear
himself
and
again
stops
finally
afraid
that
his
silence
may
provoke
the
dreaded
cry
closure
he
starts
off
again
the
clamour
becomes
unbearable
when
parliamentary
assemblies
reach
a
certain
pitch
of
excitement
they
become
identical
with
ordinary
heterogeneous
crowds
and
their
sentiments
in
consequence
present
the
peculiarity
of
being
always
extreme
they
will
be
seen
to
commit
acts
of
the
greatest
heroism
or
the
worst
excesses
the
individual
is
no
longer
himself
and
so
entirely
is
this
the
case
that
he
will
vote
measures
most
adverse
to
his
personal
interests
the
history
of
the
french
revolution
shows
to
what
an
extent
assemblies
are
capable
of
losing
their
and
of
obeying
suggestions
most
contrary
to
their
interests
it
was
an
enormous
sacrifice
for
the
nobility
to
renounce
its
privileges
yet
it
did
so
without
hesitation
on
a
famous
night
during
the
sittings
of
the
constituant
assembly
by
renouncing
their
inviolability
the
men
of
the
convention
placed
themselves
under
a
perpetual
menace
of
death
and
yet
they
took
this
step
and
were
not
afraid
to
decimate
their
own
ranks
though
perfectly
aware
that
the
scaffold
to
which
they
were
sending
their
colleagues
might
be
their
own
fate
the
truth
is
they
had
attained
to
that
completely
automatic
state
which
i
have
described
elsewhere
and
no
consideration
would
hinder
them
from
yielding
to
the
suggestions
by
which
they
were
hypnotised
the
following
passage
from
the
memoirs
of
one
of
them
is
absolutely
typical
on
this
score
the
decisions
with
which
we
have
been
so
reproached
he
says
were
not
desired
by
us
two
days
a
single
day
before
they
were
taken
it
was
the
crisis
and
nothing
else
that
gave
rise
to
them
nothing
can
be
more
accurate
the
same
phenomena
of
unconsciousness
were
to
be
witnessed
during
all
the
stormy
sittings
of
the
convention
they
approved
and
decreed
measures
says
taine
which
they
held
in
horror
measures
which
were
not
only
stupid
and
foolish
but
measures
that
were
crimes
the
murder
of
innocent
men
the
murder
of
their
friends
the
left
supported
by
the
right
unanimously
and
amid
loud
applause
sent
to
the
scaffold
danton
its
natural
chief
and
the
great
promoter
and
leader
of
the
revolution
unanimously
and
amid
the
greatest
applause
the
right
supported
by
the
left
votes
the
worst
decrees
of
the
revolutionary
government
unanimously
and
amid
cries
of
admiration
and
enthusiasm
amid
demonstrations
of
passionate
sympathy
for
collot
couthon
and
robespierre
the
convention
by
spontaneous
and
repeated
keeps
in
office
the
homicidal
government
which
the
plain
detests
because
it
is
homicidal
and
the
mountain
detests
because
it
is
decimated
by
it
the
plain
and
the
mountain
the
majority
and
the
minority
finish
by
consenting
to
help
on
their
own
suicide
the
prairial
the
entire
convention
offered
itself
to
the
executioner
the
thermidor
during
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
that
followed
robespierre
speech
it
did
the
same
thing
again
this
picture
may
appear
sombre
yet
it
is
accurate
parliamentary
assemblies
sufficiently
excited
and
hypnotised
offer
the
same
characteristics
they
become
an
unstable
flock
obedient
to
every
impulsion
the
following
description
of
the
assembly
of
is
due
to
spuller
a
parliamentarian
whose
faith
in
democracy
is
above
suspicion
i
reproduce
it
from
the
revue
litteraire
and
it
is
thoroughly
typical
it
offers
an
example
of
all
the
exaggerated
sentiments
which
i
have
described
as
characteristic
of
crowds
and
of
that
excessive
changeableness
which
permits
of
assemblies
passing
from
moment
to
moment
from
one
set
of
sentiments
to
another
entirely
opposite
the
republican
party
was
brought
to
its
perdition
by
its
divisions
its
jealousies
its
suspicions
and
in
turn
its
blind
confidence
and
its
limitless
hopes
its
ingenuousness
and
candour
were
only
equalled
by
its
universal
mistrust
an
absence
of
all
sense
of
legality
of
all
comprehension
of
discipline
together
with
boundless
terrors
and
illusions
the
peasant
and
the
child
are
on
a
level
in
these
respects
their
calm
is
as
great
as
their
impatience
their
ferocity
is
equal
to
their
docility
this
condition
is
the
natural
consequence
of
a
temperament
that
is
not
formed
and
of
the
lack
of
education
nothing
astonishes
such
persons
and
everything
disconcerts
them
trembling
with
fear
or
brave
to
the
point
of
heroism
they
would
go
through
fire
and
water
or
fly
from
a
shadow
they
are
ignorant
of
cause
and
effect
and
of
the
connecting
links
between
events
they
are
as
promptly
discouraged
as
they
are
exalted
they
are
subject
to
every
description
of
panic
they
are
always
either
too
highly
strung
or
too
downcast
but
never
in
the
mood
or
the
measure
the
situation
would
require
more
fluid
than
water
they
reflect
every
line
and
assume
every
shape
what
sort
of
a
foundation
for
a
government
can
they
be
expected
to
supply
fortunately
all
the
characteristics
just
described
as
to
be
met
with
in
parliamentary
assemblies
are
in
no
wise
constantly
displayed
such
assemblies
only
constitute
crowds
at
certain
moments
the
individuals
composing
them
retain
their
individuality
in
a
great
number
of
cases
which
explains
how
it
is
that
an
assembly
is
able
to
turn
out
excellent
technical
laws
it
is
true
that
the
author
of
these
laws
is
a
specialist
who
has
prepared
them
in
the
quiet
of
his
study
and
that
in
reality
the
law
voted
is
the
work
of
an
individual
and
not
of
an
assembly
these
laws
are
naturally
the
best
they
are
only
liable
to
have
disastrous
results
when
a
series
of
amendments
has
converted
them
into
the
outcome
of
a
collective
effort
the
work
of
a
crowd
is
always
inferior
whatever
its
nature
to
that
of
an
isolated
individual
it
is
specialists
who
safeguard
assemblies
from
passing
or
unworkable
measures
the
specialist
in
this
case
is
a
temporary
leader
of
crowds
the
assembly
is
without
influence
on
him
but
he
has
influence
over
the
assembly
in
spite
of
all
the
difficulties
attending
their
working
parliamentary
assemblies
are
the
best
form
of
government
mankind
has
discovered
as
yet
and
more
especially
the
best
means
it
has
found
to
escape
the
yoke
of
personal
tyrannies
they
constitute
assuredly
the
ideal
government
at
any
rate
for
philosophers
thinkers
writers
artists
and
learned
men
in
a
word
for
all
those
who
form
the
cream
of
a
civilisation
moreover
in
reality
they
only
present
two
serious
dangers
one
being
inevitable
financial
waste
and
the
other
the
progressive
restriction
of
the
liberty
of
the
individual
the
first
of
these
dangers
is
the
necessary
consequence
of
the
exigencies
and
want
of
foresight
of
electoral
crowds
should
a
member
of
an
assembly
propose
a
measure
giving
apparent
satisfaction
to
democratic
ideas
should
he
bring
in
a
bill
for
instance
to
assure
pensions
to
all
workers
and
to
increase
the
wages
of
any
class
of
state
employes
the
other
deputies
victims
of
suggestion
in
their
dread
of
their
electors
will
not
venture
to
seem
to
disregard
the
interests
of
the
latter
by
rejecting
the
proposed
measure
although
well
aware
they
are
imposing
a
fresh
strain
on
the
budget
and
necessitating
the
creation
of
new
taxes
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
hesitate
to
give
their
votes
the
consequences
of
the
increase
of
expenditure
are
remote
and
will
not
entail
disagreeable
consequences
for
them
personally
while
the
consequences
of
a
negative
vote
might
clearly
come
to
light
when
they
next
present
themselves
for
in
addition
to
this
first
cause
of
an
exaggerated
expenditure
there
is
another
not
less
imperative
the
necessity
of
voting
all
grants
for
local
purposes
a
deputy
is
unable
to
oppose
grants
of
this
kind
because
they
represent
once
more
the
exigencies
of
the
electors
and
because
each
individual
deputy
can
only
obtain
what
he
requires
for
his
own
constituency
on
the
condition
of
acceding
to
similar
demands
on
the
part
of
his
colleagues
in
its
issue
of
april
the
economiste
published
a
curious
review
of
the
figures
that
may
be
reached
by
expenditure
caused
solely
by
electoral
considerations
and
notably
of
the
outlay
on
railways
to
put
langayes
a
town
of
inhabitants
situated
on
a
mountain
in
communication
with
puy
a
railway
is
voted
that
will
cost
millions
of
francs
seven
millions
are
to
be
spent
to
put
beaumont
inhabitants
in
communication
with
millions
to
put
oust
a
village
of
inhabitants
in
communication
with
seix
inhabitants
millions
to
put
prade
in
communication
with
the
hamlet
of
olette
inhabitants
in
alone
millions
of
francs
were
voted
for
railways
of
only
local
utility
there
is
other
no
less
important
expenditure
necessitated
also
by
electioneering
considerations
the
law
instituting
pensions
will
soon
involve
a
minimum
annual
outlay
of
millions
according
to
the
minister
of
finance
and
of
millions
according
to
the
academician
it
is
evident
that
the
continued
growth
of
expenditure
of
this
kind
must
end
in
bankruptcy
many
european
countries
portugal
greece
spain
turkey
have
reached
this
stage
and
others
such
as
italy
will
soon
be
reduced
to
the
same
extremity
still
too
much
alarm
need
not
be
felt
at
this
state
of
things
since
the
public
has
successively
consented
to
put
up
with
the
reduction
of
in
the
payment
of
their
coupons
by
these
different
countries
bankruptcy
under
these
ingenious
conditions
allows
the
equilibrium
of
budgets
difficult
to
balance
to
be
instantly
restored
moreover
wars
socialism
and
economic
conflicts
hold
in
store
for
us
a
profusion
of
other
catastrophes
in
the
period
of
universal
disintegration
we
are
traversing
and
it
is
necessary
to
be
resigned
to
living
from
hand
to
mouth
without
too
much
concern
for
a
future
we
can
not
control
the
second
of
the
dangers
referred
to
above
the
inevitable
restrictions
on
liberty
consummated
by
parliamentary
assemblies
is
apparently
less
obvious
but
is
nevertheless
very
real
it
is
the
result
of
the
innumerable
laws
having
always
a
restrictive
action
which
parliaments
consider
themselves
obliged
to
vote
and
to
whose
consequences
owing
to
their
shortsightedness
they
are
in
a
great
measure
blind
the
danger
must
indeed
be
most
inevitable
since
even
england
itself
which
assuredly
offers
the
most
popular
type
of
the
parliamentary
regime
the
type
in
which
the
representative
is
most
independent
of
his
elector
has
been
unable
to
escape
it
herbert
spencer
has
shown
in
a
work
already
old
that
the
increase
of
apparent
liberty
must
needs
be
followed
by
the
decrease
of
real
liberty
returning
to
this
contention
in
his
recent
book
the
individual
versus
the
state
he
thus
expresses
himself
with
regard
to
the
english
parliament
legislation
since
this
period
has
followed
the
course
i
pointed
out
rapidly
multiplying
dictatorial
measures
have
continually
tended
to
restrict
individual
liberties
and
this
in
two
ways
regulations
have
been
established
every
year
in
greater
number
imposing
a
constraint
on
the
citizen
in
matters
in
which
his
acts
were
formerly
completely
free
and
forcing
him
to
accomplish
acts
which
he
was
formerly
at
liberty
to
accomplish
or
not
to
accomplish
at
will
at
the
same
time
heavier
and
heavier
public
and
especially
local
burdens
have
still
further
restricted
his
liberty
by
diminishing
the
portion
of
his
profits
he
can
spend
as
he
chooses
and
by
augmenting
the
portion
which
is
taken
from
him
to
be
spent
according
to
the
good
pleasure
of
the
public
authorities
this
progressive
restriction
of
liberties
shows
itself
in
every
country
in
a
special
shape
which
herbert
spencer
has
not
pointed
out
it
is
that
the
passing
of
these
innumerable
series
of
legislative
measures
all
of
them
in
a
general
way
of
a
restrictive
order
conduces
necessarily
to
augment
the
number
the
power
and
the
influence
of
the
functionaries
charged
with
their
application
these
functionaries
tend
in
this
way
to
become
the
veritable
masters
of
civilised
countries
their
power
is
all
the
greater
owing
to
the
fact
that
amidst
the
incessant
transfer
of
authority
the
administrative
caste
is
alone
in
being
untouched
by
these
changes
is
alone
in
possessing
irresponsibility
impersonality
and
perpetuity
there
is
no
more
oppressive
despotism
than
that
which
presents
itself
under
this
triple
form
this
incessant
creation
of
restrictive
laws
and
regulations
surrounding
the
pettiest
actions
of
existence
with
the
most
complicated
formalities
inevitably
has
for
its
result
the
confining
within
narrower
and
narrower
limits
of
the
sphere
in
which
the
citizen
may
move
freely
victims
of
the
delusion
that
equality
and
liberty
are
the
better
assured
by
the
multiplication
of
laws
nations
daily
consent
to
put
up
with
trammels
increasingly
burdensome
they
do
not
accept
this
legislation
with
impunity
accustomed
to
put
up
with
every
yoke
they
soon
end
by
desiring
servitude
and
lose
all
spontaneousness
and
energy
they
are
then
no
more
than
vain
shadows
passive
unresisting
and
powerless
automata
arrived
at
this
point
the
individual
is
bound
to
seek
outside
himself
the
forces
he
no
longer
finds
within
him
the
functions
of
governments
necessarily
increase
in
proportion
as
the
indifference
and
helplessness
of
the
citizens
grow
they
it
is
who
must
necessarily
exhibit
the
initiative
enterprising
and
guiding
spirit
in
which
private
persons
are
lacking
it
falls
on
them
to
undertake
everything
direct
everything
and
take
everything
under
their
protection
the
state
becomes
an
god
still
experience
shows
that
the
power
of
such
gods
was
never
either
very
durable
or
very
strong
this
progressive
restriction
of
all
liberties
in
the
case
of
certain
peoples
in
spite
of
an
outward
license
that
gives
them
the
illusion
that
these
liberties
are
still
in
their
possession
seems
at
least
as
much
a
consequence
of
their
old
age
as
of
any
particular
system
it
constitutes
one
of
the
precursory
symptoms
of
that
decadent
phase
which
up
to
now
no
civilisation
has
escaped
judging
by
the
lessons
of
the
past
and
by
the
symptoms
that
strike
the
attention
on
every
side
several
of
our
modern
civilisations
have
reached
that
phase
of
extreme
old
age
which
precedes
decadence
it
seems
inevitable
that
all
peoples
should
pass
through
identical
phases
of
existence
since
history
is
so
often
seen
to
repeat
its
course
it
is
easy
to
note
briefly
these
common
phases
of
the
evolution
of
civilisations
and
i
shall
terminate
this
work
with
a
summary
of
them
this
rapid
sketch
will
perhaps
throw
some
gleams
of
light
on
the
causes
of
the
power
at
present
wielded
by
crowds
if
we
examine
in
their
main
lines
the
genesis
of
the
greatness
and
of
the
fall
of
the
civilisations
that
preceded
our
own
what
do
we
see
at
the
dawn
of
civilisation
a
swarm
of
men
of
various
origin
brought
together
by
the
chances
of
migrations
invasions
and
conquests
of
different
blood
and
of
equally
different
languages
and
beliefs
the
only
common
bond
of
union
between
these
men
is
the
law
of
a
chief
the
psychological
characteristics
of
crowds
are
present
in
an
eminent
degree
in
these
confused
agglomerations
they
have
the
transient
cohesion
of
crowds
their
heroism
their
weaknesses
their
impulsiveness
and
their
violence
nothing
is
stable
in
connection
with
them
they
are
barbarians
at
length
time
accomplishes
its
work
the
identity
of
surroundings
the
repeated
intermingling
of
races
the
necessities
of
life
in
common
exert
their
influence
the
assemblage
of
dissimilar
units
begins
to
blend
into
a
whole
to
form
a
race
that
is
an
aggregate
possessing
common
characteristics
and
sentiments
to
which
heredity
will
give
greater
and
greater
fixity
the
crowd
has
become
a
people
and
this
people
is
able
to
emerge
from
its
barbarous
state
however
it
will
only
entirely
emerge
therefrom
when
after
long
efforts
struggles
necessarily
repeated
and
innumerable
recommencements
it
shall
have
acquired
an
ideal
the
nature
of
this
ideal
is
of
slight
importance
whether
it
be
the
cult
of
rome
the
might
of
athens
or
the
triumph
of
allah
it
will
suffice
to
endow
all
the
individuals
of
the
race
that
is
forming
with
perfect
unity
of
sentiment
and
thought
at
this
stage
a
new
civilisation
with
its
institutions
its
beliefs
and
its
arts
may
be
born
in
pursuit
of
its
ideal
the
race
will
acquire
in
succession
the
qualities
necessary
to
give
it
splendour
vigour
and
grandeur
at
times
no
doubt
it
will
still
be
a
crowd
but
henceforth
beneath
the
mobile
and
changing
characteristics
of
crowds
is
found
a
solid
substratum
the
genius
of
the
race
which
confines
within
narrow
limits
the
transformations
of
a
nation
and
overrules
the
play
of
chance
after
having
exerted
its
creative
action
time
begins
that
work
of
destruction
from
which
neither
gods
nor
men
escape
having
reached
a
certain
level
of
strength
and
complexity
a
civilisation
ceases
to
grow
and
having
ceased
to
grow
it
is
condemned
to
a
speedy
decline
the
hour
of
its
old
age
has
struck
this
inevitable
hour
is
always
marked
by
the
weakening
of
the
ideal
that
was
the
mainstay
of
the
race
in
proportion
as
this
ideal
pales
all
the
religious
political
and
social
structures
inspired
by
it
begin
to
be
shaken
with
the
progressive
perishing
of
its
ideal
the
race
loses
more
and
more
the
qualities
that
lent
it
its
cohesion
its
unity
and
its
strength
the
personality
and
intelligence
of
the
individual
may
increase
but
at
the
same
time
this
collective
egoism
of
the
race
is
replaced
by
an
excessive
development
of
the
egoism
of
the
individual
accompanied
by
a
weakening
of
character
and
a
lessening
of
the
capacity
for
action
what
constituted
a
people
a
unity
a
whole
becomes
in
the
end
an
agglomeration
of
individualities
lacking
cohesion
and
artificially
held
together
for
a
time
by
its
traditions
and
institutions
it
is
at
this
stage
that
men
divided
by
their
interests
and
aspirations
and
incapable
any
longer
of
require
directing
in
their
pettiest
acts
and
that
the
state
exerts
an
absorbing
influence
with
the
definite
loss
of
its
old
ideal
the
genius
of
the
race
entirely
disappears
it
is
a
mere
swarm
of
isolated
individuals
and
returns
to
its
original
state
that
of
a
crowd
without
consistency
and
without
a
future
it
has
all
the
transitory
characteristics
of
crowds
its
civilisation
is
now
without
stability
and
at
the
mercy
of
every
chance
the
populace
is
sovereign
and
the
tide
of
barbarism
mounts
the
civilisation
may
still
seem
brilliant
because
it
possesses
an
outward
front
the
work
of
a
long
past
but
it
is
in
reality
an
edifice
crumbling
to
ruin
which
nothing
supports
and
destined
to
fall
in
at
the
first
storm
to
pass
in
pursuit
of
an
ideal
from
the
barbarous
to
the
civilised
state
and
then
when
this
ideal
has
lost
its
virtue
to
decline
and
die
such
is
the
cycle
of
the
life
of
a
people
