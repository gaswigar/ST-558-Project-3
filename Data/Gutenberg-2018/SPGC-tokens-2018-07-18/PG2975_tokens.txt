prince
charles
de
biron
the
younger
son
of
the
duke
of
courland
in
the
russian
service
knight
of
the
order
of
alexander
newski
gave
me
a
distinguished
reception
after
reading
his
father
letter
he
was
years
of
age
without
being
handsome
and
polite
and
and
he
spoke
french
extremely
well
in
a
few
sentences
he
let
me
know
what
he
could
do
for
me
if
i
intended
to
spend
some
time
at
riga
his
table
his
friends
his
pleasures
his
horses
his
advice
and
his
purse
all
these
were
at
my
service
and
he
offered
them
with
the
frankness
of
the
soldier
and
the
geniality
of
the
prince
i
can
not
offer
you
a
lodging
he
said
because
i
have
hardly
enough
room
for
myself
but
i
will
see
that
you
get
a
comfortable
apartment
somewhere
the
apartment
was
soon
found
and
i
was
taken
to
it
by
one
of
the
prince
i
was
scarcely
established
when
the
prince
came
to
see
me
and
made
me
dine
with
him
just
as
i
was
it
was
an
unceremonious
dinner
and
i
was
pleased
to
meet
campioni
of
whom
i
have
spoken
several
times
in
these
memoirs
he
was
a
dancer
but
very
superior
to
his
fellows
and
fit
for
the
best
company
polite
witty
intelligent
and
a
libertine
in
a
gentlemanly
way
he
was
devoid
of
prejudices
and
fond
of
women
good
cheer
and
heavy
play
and
knew
how
to
keep
an
even
mind
both
in
good
and
evil
fortune
we
were
mutually
pleased
to
see
each
other
again
another
guest
a
certain
baron
de
heleine
from
savoy
had
a
pretty
but
very
insignificant
wife
the
baron
a
fat
man
was
a
gamester
a
gourmand
and
a
lover
of
wine
add
that
he
was
a
past
master
in
the
art
of
getting
into
debt
and
lulling
his
creditors
into
a
state
of
false
security
and
you
have
all
his
capacities
for
in
all
other
respects
he
was
a
fool
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
an
and
the
prince
mistress
also
dined
with
us
this
mistress
who
was
pale
thin
and
but
also
pretty
might
be
twenty
years
old
she
hardly
ate
anything
saying
that
she
was
ill
and
did
not
like
anything
on
the
table
discontent
shewed
itself
on
her
every
feature
the
prince
endeavoured
but
all
in
vain
to
make
her
eat
and
drink
she
refused
everything
disdainfully
the
prince
laughed
at
her
in
such
a
manner
as
not
to
wound
her
feelings
we
spent
two
hours
pleasantly
enough
at
table
and
after
coffee
had
been
served
the
prince
who
had
business
shook
me
by
the
hand
and
left
me
with
campioni
telling
me
always
to
regard
his
table
as
my
last
resource
this
old
friend
and
took
me
to
his
house
to
introduce
me
to
his
wife
and
family
i
did
not
know
that
he
had
married
a
second
time
i
found
the
wife
to
be
an
englishwoman
thin
but
full
of
intelligence
she
had
a
daughter
of
eleven
who
might
easily
have
been
taken
for
fifteen
she
too
was
marvellously
intelligent
and
danced
sang
and
played
on
the
piano
and
gave
such
glances
that
shewed
that
nature
had
been
swifter
than
her
years
she
made
a
conquest
of
me
and
her
father
congratulated
me
to
my
delight
but
her
mother
offended
her
dreadfully
by
calling
her
baby
i
went
for
a
walk
with
campioni
who
gave
me
a
good
deal
of
information
beginning
with
himself
i
have
lived
for
ten
years
he
said
with
that
woman
betty
whom
you
admired
so
much
is
not
my
daughter
the
others
are
my
children
by
my
englishwoman
i
have
left
petersburg
for
two
years
and
i
live
here
well
enough
and
have
pupils
who
do
me
credit
i
play
with
the
prince
sometimes
winning
and
sometimes
losing
but
i
never
win
enough
to
enable
me
to
satisfy
a
wretched
creditor
i
left
at
petersburg
who
persecutes
me
on
account
of
a
bill
of
exchange
he
may
put
me
in
prison
any
day
and
i
am
always
expecting
him
to
do
so
is
the
bill
for
a
large
sum
five
hundred
roubles
that
is
only
two
thousand
francs
yes
but
unfortunately
i
have
not
got
it
you
ought
to
annul
the
debt
by
paying
small
sums
on
account
the
rascal
wo
let
me
then
what
do
you
propose
doing
win
a
heavy
sum
if
i
can
and
escape
into
poland
the
baron
de
heleine
will
run
away
too
if
he
can
for
he
only
lives
on
credit
the
prince
is
very
useful
to
us
as
we
are
able
to
play
at
his
house
but
if
we
get
into
difficulty
he
could
not
extricate
us
as
he
is
heavily
in
debt
himself
he
always
loses
at
play
his
mistress
is
expensive
and
gives
him
a
great
deal
of
trouble
by
her
why
is
she
so
sour
she
wants
him
to
keep
his
word
for
he
promised
to
get
her
married
at
the
end
of
two
years
and
on
the
strength
of
this
promise
she
let
him
give
her
two
children
the
two
years
have
passed
by
and
the
children
are
there
and
she
will
no
longer
allow
him
to
have
anything
to
do
with
her
for
fear
of
having
a
third
child
ca
the
prince
find
her
a
husband
he
did
find
her
a
lieutenant
but
she
wo
hear
of
anybody
under
the
rank
of
major
the
prince
gave
a
state
dinner
to
general
woyakoff
for
whom
i
had
a
letter
baroness
korf
madame
ittinoff
and
to
a
young
lady
who
was
going
to
marry
baron
budberg
whom
i
had
known
at
florence
turin
and
augsburg
and
whom
i
may
possibly
have
forgotten
to
mention
all
these
friends
made
me
spend
three
weeks
very
pleasantly
and
i
was
especially
pleased
with
old
general
woyakoff
this
worthy
man
had
been
at
venice
fifty
years
before
when
the
russians
were
still
called
muscovites
and
the
founder
of
petersburg
was
still
alive
he
had
grown
old
like
an
oak
without
changing
his
horizons
he
thought
the
world
was
just
the
same
as
it
had
been
when
he
was
young
and
was
eloquent
in
his
praise
of
the
venetian
government
imagining
it
to
be
still
the
same
as
he
had
left
it
at
riga
an
english
merchant
named
collins
told
me
that
the
baron
de
stenau
who
had
given
me
the
forged
bill
of
exchange
had
been
hanged
in
portugal
this
baron
was
a
poor
clerk
and
the
son
of
a
small
tradesman
and
had
left
his
desk
in
search
of
adventure
and
thus
he
had
ended
may
god
have
mercy
upon
his
soul
one
evening
a
russian
on
his
way
from
poland
where
he
had
been
executing
some
commission
for
the
russian
court
called
on
the
prince
played
and
lost
twenty
thousand
roubles
on
his
word
of
honour
campioni
was
the
dealer
the
russian
gave
bills
of
exchange
in
payment
of
his
debts
but
as
soon
as
he
got
to
petersburg
he
dishonoured
his
own
bills
and
declared
them
worthless
not
caring
for
his
honour
or
good
faith
the
result
of
this
piece
of
knavery
was
not
only
that
his
creditors
were
defrauded
but
gaming
was
henceforth
strictly
forbidden
in
the
officers
quarters
this
russian
was
the
same
that
betrayed
the
secrets
of
elizabeth
petrovna
when
she
was
at
war
with
prussia
he
communicated
to
peter
the
empress
nephew
and
all
the
orders
she
sent
to
her
generals
and
peter
in
his
turn
passed
on
the
information
to
the
prussian
king
whom
he
worshipped
on
the
death
of
elizabeth
peter
put
this
traitor
at
the
head
of
the
department
for
commerce
and
the
fellow
actually
made
known
with
the
czar
sanction
the
service
for
which
he
had
received
such
a
reward
and
thus
instead
of
looking
upon
his
conduct
as
disgraceful
he
gloried
over
it
peter
could
not
have
been
aware
of
the
fact
that
though
it
is
sometimes
necessary
to
reward
treachery
the
traitor
himself
is
always
abhorred
and
despised
i
have
remarked
that
it
was
campioni
who
dealt
but
he
dealt
for
the
prince
who
held
the
bank
i
had
certain
claims
but
as
i
remarked
that
i
expected
nothing
and
would
gladly
sell
my
expectations
for
a
hundred
roubles
the
prince
took
me
at
my
word
and
gave
me
the
amount
immediately
thus
i
was
the
only
person
who
made
any
money
by
our
play
catherine
ii
wishing
to
shew
herself
to
her
new
subjects
over
whom
she
was
in
reality
supreme
though
she
had
put
the
ghost
of
a
king
in
the
person
of
stanislas
poniatowski
her
former
favourite
on
the
throne
of
poland
came
to
riga
and
it
was
then
i
saw
this
great
sovereign
for
the
first
time
i
was
a
witness
of
the
kindness
and
affability
with
which
she
treated
the
livonian
nobility
and
of
the
way
in
which
she
kissed
the
young
ladies
who
had
come
to
kiss
her
hand
upon
the
mouth
she
was
surrounded
by
the
orloffs
and
by
other
nobles
who
had
assisted
in
placing
her
on
the
throne
for
the
comfort
and
pleasure
of
her
loyal
subjects
the
empress
graciously
expressed
her
intention
of
holding
a
bank
at
faro
of
ten
thousand
roubles
instantly
the
table
and
the
cards
were
brought
forward
and
the
piles
of
gold
placed
in
order
she
took
the
cards
pretended
to
shuffle
them
and
gave
them
to
the
first
comer
to
cut
she
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
bank
broken
at
the
first
deal
and
indeed
this
result
was
to
be
expected
as
anybody
not
an
absolute
idiot
could
see
how
the
cards
were
going
the
next
day
the
empress
set
out
for
mitau
where
triumphal
arches
were
erected
in
her
honour
they
were
made
of
wood
as
stone
is
scarce
in
poland
and
indeed
there
would
not
have
been
time
to
build
stone
arches
the
day
after
her
arrival
great
alarm
prevailed
for
news
came
that
a
revolution
was
ready
to
burst
out
at
petersburg
and
some
even
said
that
it
had
begun
the
rebels
wished
to
have
forth
from
his
prison
the
hapless
ivan
ivanovitz
who
had
been
proclaimed
emperor
in
his
cradle
and
dethroned
by
elizabeth
petrovna
two
officers
to
whom
the
guardianship
of
the
prince
had
been
confided
had
killed
the
poor
innocent
monarch
when
they
saw
that
they
would
be
overpowered
the
assassination
of
the
innocent
prince
created
such
a
sensation
that
the
wary
panin
fearing
for
the
results
sent
courier
after
courier
to
the
empress
urging
her
to
return
to
petersburg
and
shew
herself
to
the
people
catherine
was
thus
obliged
to
leave
mitau
hours
after
she
had
entered
it
and
after
hastening
back
to
the
capital
she
arrived
only
to
find
that
the
excitement
had
entirely
subsided
for
politic
reasons
the
assassins
of
the
wretched
ivan
were
rewarded
and
the
bold
man
who
had
endeavoured
to
rise
by
her
fall
was
beheaded
the
report
ran
that
catherine
had
concerted
the
whole
affair
with
the
assassins
but
this
was
speedily
set
down
as
a
calumny
the
czarina
was
but
neither
cruel
nor
perfidious
when
i
saw
her
at
riga
she
was
and
had
reigned
two
years
she
was
not
precisely
handsome
but
nevertheless
her
appearance
was
pleasing
her
expression
kindly
and
there
was
about
her
an
air
of
calm
and
tranquillity
which
never
left
her
at
about
the
same
time
a
friend
of
baron
de
heleine
arrived
from
petersburg
on
his
way
to
warsaw
his
name
was
marquis
dragon
but
he
called
himself
he
came
from
naples
was
a
great
gamester
a
skilled
swordsman
and
was
always
ready
to
extract
himself
from
a
difficulty
by
a
duel
he
had
left
petersburg
because
the
orloffs
had
persuaded
the
empress
to
prohibit
games
of
chance
it
was
thought
strange
that
the
prohibition
should
come
from
the
orloffs
as
gaming
had
been
their
principal
means
of
gaining
a
livelihood
before
they
entered
on
the
more
dangerous
and
certainly
not
more
honourable
profession
of
conspiracy
however
this
measure
was
really
a
sensible
one
having
been
gamesters
themselves
they
knew
that
gamesters
are
mostly
knaves
and
always
ready
to
enter
into
any
intrigue
or
conspiracy
provided
it
assures
them
some
small
gain
there
could
not
have
been
better
judges
of
gaming
and
its
consequences
than
they
were
but
though
a
gamester
may
be
a
rogue
he
may
still
have
a
good
heart
and
it
is
only
just
to
say
that
this
was
the
case
with
the
orloffs
alexis
gained
the
slash
which
adorns
his
face
in
a
tavern
and
the
man
who
gave
the
blow
had
just
lost
to
him
a
large
sum
of
money
and
considered
his
opponent
success
to
be
rather
the
result
of
dexterity
than
fortune
when
alexis
became
rich
and
powerful
instead
of
revenging
himself
he
hastened
to
make
his
enemy
fortune
this
was
nobly
done
dragon
whose
first
principle
was
always
to
turn
up
the
best
card
and
whose
second
principle
was
never
to
shirk
a
duel
had
gone
to
petersburg
in
with
the
baron
de
heleine
elizabeth
was
still
on
the
throne
but
peter
duke
of
holstein
the
had
already
begun
to
loom
large
on
the
horizon
dragon
used
to
frequent
the
fencing
school
where
the
prince
was
a
frequent
visitor
and
there
encountered
all
comers
successfully
the
duke
got
angry
and
one
day
he
took
up
a
foil
and
defied
the
neapolitan
marquis
to
a
combat
dragon
accepted
and
was
thoroughly
beaten
while
the
duke
went
off
in
triumph
for
he
might
say
from
henceforth
that
he
was
the
best
fencer
in
petersburg
when
the
prince
had
gone
dragon
could
not
withstand
the
temptation
of
saying
that
he
had
only
let
himself
be
beaten
for
fear
of
offending
his
antagonist
and
this
boast
soon
got
to
the
ears
the
great
man
was
terribly
enraged
and
swore
he
would
have
him
banished
from
petersburg
if
he
did
not
use
all
his
skill
and
at
the
same
time
he
sent
an
order
to
dragon
to
be
at
the
fencing
school
the
next
day
the
impatient
duke
was
the
first
to
arrive
and
was
not
long
in
coming
the
prince
began
reproaching
him
for
what
he
had
said
the
day
before
but
the
neapolitan
far
from
denying
the
fact
expressed
himself
that
he
had
felt
himself
obliged
to
shew
his
respect
for
his
prince
by
letting
him
rap
him
about
for
upwards
of
two
hours
very
good
said
the
duke
but
now
it
is
your
turn
and
if
you
do
do
your
best
i
will
drive
you
from
st
petersburg
my
lord
your
highness
shall
be
obeyed
i
shall
not
allow
you
to
touch
me
once
but
i
hope
you
will
deign
to
take
me
under
your
protection
the
two
champions
passed
the
whole
morning
with
the
foils
and
the
duke
was
hit
a
hundred
times
without
being
able
to
touch
his
antagonist
at
last
convinced
of
dragon
superiority
he
threw
down
his
foil
and
shook
him
by
the
hand
and
made
him
his
with
the
rank
of
major
in
his
regiment
of
holsteiners
shortly
after
having
won
the
good
graces
of
the
duke
obtained
leave
to
hold
a
bank
at
faro
in
his
court
and
in
three
or
four
years
he
amassed
a
fortune
of
a
hundred
thousand
roubles
which
he
took
with
him
to
the
court
of
king
stanislas
where
games
of
all
sorts
were
allowed
when
he
passed
through
riga
heleine
introduced
him
to
prince
charles
who
begged
him
to
call
on
him
the
next
day
and
to
shew
his
skill
with
the
foils
against
himself
and
some
of
his
friends
i
had
the
honour
to
be
of
the
number
and
thoroughly
well
he
beat
us
for
his
skill
was
that
of
a
demon
i
was
vain
enough
to
become
angry
at
being
hit
at
every
pass
and
told
him
that
i
should
not
be
afraid
to
meet
him
at
a
game
of
sharps
he
was
calmer
and
replied
by
taking
my
hand
and
saying
with
the
naked
sword
i
fence
in
quite
another
style
and
you
are
quite
right
not
to
fear
anyone
for
you
fence
very
well
set
out
for
warsaw
the
next
day
but
he
unfortunately
found
the
place
occupied
by
more
cunning
greeks
than
himself
in
six
months
they
had
relieved
him
of
his
hundred
thousand
roubles
but
such
is
the
lot
of
gamesters
no
craft
can
be
more
wretched
than
theirs
a
week
before
i
left
riga
where
i
stayed
two
months
campioni
fled
by
favour
of
the
good
prince
charles
and
in
a
few
days
the
baron
de
heleine
followed
him
without
taking
leave
of
a
noble
army
of
creditors
he
only
wrote
a
letter
to
the
englishman
collins
to
whom
he
owed
a
thousand
crowns
telling
him
that
like
an
honest
man
he
had
left
his
debts
where
he
had
contracted
them
we
shall
hear
more
of
these
three
persons
in
the
course
of
two
years
campioni
left
me
his
travelling
carriage
which
obliged
me
to
use
six
horses
on
my
journey
to
petersburg
i
was
sorry
to
leave
betty
and
i
kept
up
an
epistolary
correspondence
with
her
mother
throughout
the
whole
of
my
stay
at
petersburg
i
left
riga
with
the
thermometer
indicating
fifteen
degrees
of
frost
but
though
i
travelled
day
and
night
not
leaving
the
carriage
for
the
sixty
hours
for
which
my
journey
lasted
i
did
not
feel
the
cold
in
the
least
i
had
taken
care
to
pay
all
the
stages
in
advance
and
marshal
braun
governor
of
livonia
had
given
me
the
proper
passport
on
the
box
seat
was
a
french
servant
who
had
begged
me
to
allow
him
to
wait
on
me
for
the
journey
in
return
for
a
seat
beside
the
coachman
he
kept
his
word
and
served
me
well
and
though
he
was
but
ill
clad
he
bore
the
horrible
cold
for
two
days
and
three
nights
without
appearing
to
feel
it
it
is
only
a
frenchman
who
can
bear
such
trials
a
russian
in
similar
attire
would
have
been
frozen
to
death
in
hours
despite
plentiful
doses
of
corn
brandy
i
lost
sight
of
this
individual
when
i
arrived
at
petersburg
but
i
met
him
again
three
months
after
richly
dressed
and
occupying
a
seat
beside
mine
at
the
table
of
de
czernitscheff
he
was
the
uchitel
of
the
young
count
who
sat
beside
him
but
i
shall
have
occasion
to
speak
more
at
length
of
the
office
of
uchitel
or
tutor
in
russia
as
for
lambert
who
was
beside
me
in
the
carriage
he
did
nothing
but
eat
drink
and
sleep
the
whole
way
seldom
speaking
for
he
stammered
and
could
only
talk
about
mathematical
problems
on
which
i
was
not
always
in
the
humour
to
converse
he
was
never
amusing
never
had
any
sensible
observation
to
make
on
the
varied
scenes
through
which
we
passed
in
short
he
was
a
fool
and
wearisome
to
all
save
himself
i
was
only
stopped
once
and
that
was
at
nawa
where
the
authorities
demanded
a
passport
which
i
did
not
possess
i
told
the
governor
that
as
i
was
a
venetian
and
only
travelled
for
pleasure
i
did
not
conceive
a
passport
would
be
necessary
my
republic
not
being
at
war
with
any
other
power
and
russia
having
no
embassy
at
venice
nevertheless
i
added
if
your
excellency
wills
it
i
will
turn
back
but
i
shall
complain
to
marshal
braun
who
gave
me
the
passport
for
posting
knowing
that
i
had
not
the
political
passport
after
rubbing
his
forehead
for
a
minute
the
governor
gave
me
a
pass
which
i
still
possess
and
which
brought
me
into
petersburg
without
my
having
to
allow
the
officers
to
inspect
my
trunks
between
koporie
and
petersburg
there
is
only
a
wretched
hut
for
the
accommodation
of
travellers
the
country
is
a
wilderness
and
the
inhabitants
do
not
even
speak
russian
the
district
is
called
ingria
and
i
believe
the
jargon
spoken
has
no
affinity
with
any
other
language
the
principal
occupation
of
the
peasants
is
robbery
and
the
traveller
does
well
not
to
leave
any
of
his
effects
alone
for
a
moment
i
got
to
petersburg
just
as
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
began
to
gild
the
horizon
it
was
in
the
winter
solstice
and
the
sun
rose
at
the
extremity
of
an
immense
plain
at
minutes
past
nine
so
i
am
able
to
state
that
the
longest
night
in
russia
consists
of
eighteen
hours
and
three
quarters
i
got
down
in
a
fine
street
called
the
millione
i
found
a
couple
of
empty
rooms
which
the
people
of
the
house
furnished
with
two
beds
four
chairs
and
two
small
tables
and
rented
to
me
very
cheaply
seeing
the
enormous
stoves
i
concluded
they
must
consume
a
vast
amount
of
wood
but
i
was
mistaken
russia
is
the
land
of
stoves
as
venice
is
that
of
cisterns
i
have
inspected
the
interior
of
these
stoves
in
as
minutely
as
if
i
wished
to
find
out
the
secret
of
making
them
they
are
twelve
feet
high
by
six
broad
and
are
capable
of
warming
a
vast
room
they
are
only
refuelled
once
in
hours
for
as
soon
as
the
wood
is
reduced
to
the
state
of
charcoal
a
valve
is
shut
in
the
upper
part
of
the
stove
it
is
only
in
the
houses
of
noblemen
that
the
stoves
are
refuelled
twice
a
day
because
servants
are
strictly
forbidden
to
close
the
valve
and
for
a
very
good
reason
if
a
gentleman
chance
to
come
home
and
order
his
servants
to
warm
his
room
before
he
goes
to
bed
and
if
the
servant
is
careless
enough
to
close
the
valve
before
the
wood
is
reduced
to
charcoal
then
the
master
sleeps
his
last
sleep
being
suffocated
in
three
or
four
hours
when
the
door
is
opened
in
the
morning
he
is
found
dead
and
the
poor
devil
of
a
servant
is
immediately
hanged
whatever
he
may
say
this
sounds
severe
and
even
cruel
but
it
is
a
necessary
regulation
or
else
a
servant
would
be
able
to
get
rid
of
his
master
on
the
smallest
provocation
after
i
had
made
an
agreement
for
my
board
and
lodging
both
of
which
were
very
cheap
now
petersburg
is
as
dear
as
london
i
brought
some
pieces
of
furniture
which
were
necessaries
for
me
but
which
were
not
as
yet
much
in
use
in
russia
such
as
a
commode
a
bureau
german
is
the
language
principally
spoken
in
petersburg
and
i
did
not
speak
german
much
better
then
than
i
do
now
so
i
had
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
in
making
myself
understood
and
usually
excited
my
auditors
to
laughter
after
dinner
my
landlord
told
me
that
the
court
was
giving
a
masked
ball
to
five
thousand
persons
to
last
sixty
hours
he
gave
me
a
ticket
and
told
me
i
only
needed
to
shew
it
at
the
entrance
of
the
imperial
palace
i
decided
to
use
the
ticket
for
i
felt
that
i
should
like
to
be
present
at
so
numerous
an
assembly
and
as
i
had
my
domino
still
by
me
a
mask
was
all
i
wanted
i
went
to
the
palace
in
a
and
found
an
immense
crowd
assembled
and
dancing
going
on
in
several
halls
in
each
of
which
an
orchestra
was
stationed
there
were
long
counters
loaded
with
eatables
and
drinkables
at
which
those
who
were
hungry
or
thirsty
ate
or
drank
as
much
as
they
liked
gaiety
and
freedom
reigned
everywhere
and
the
light
of
a
thousand
wax
candles
illuminated
the
hall
everything
was
wonderful
and
all
the
more
so
from
its
contrast
with
the
cold
and
darkness
that
were
without
all
at
once
i
heard
a
masquer
beside
me
say
to
another
there
the
czarina
we
soon
saw
gregory
orloff
for
his
orders
were
to
follow
the
empress
at
a
distance
i
followed
the
masquer
and
i
was
soon
persuaded
that
it
was
really
the
empress
for
everybody
was
repeating
it
though
no
one
openly
recognized
her
those
who
really
did
not
know
her
jostled
her
in
the
crowd
and
i
imagined
that
she
would
be
delighted
at
being
treated
thus
as
it
was
a
proof
of
the
success
of
her
disguise
several
times
i
saw
her
speaking
in
russian
to
one
masquer
and
another
no
doubt
she
exposed
her
vanity
to
some
rude
shocks
but
she
had
also
the
inestimable
advantage
of
hearing
truths
which
her
courtiers
would
certainly
not
tell
her
the
masquer
who
was
pronounced
to
be
orloff
followed
her
everywhere
and
did
not
let
her
out
of
his
sight
for
a
moment
he
could
not
be
mistaken
as
he
was
an
exceptionally
tall
man
and
had
a
peculiar
carriage
of
the
head
i
arrested
my
progress
in
a
hall
where
the
french
square
dance
was
being
performed
and
suddenly
there
appeared
a
masquer
disguised
in
the
venetian
style
the
costume
was
so
complete
that
i
at
once
set
him
down
as
a
for
very
few
strangers
can
imitate
us
so
as
to
escape
detection
as
it
happened
he
came
and
stood
next
to
me
one
would
think
you
were
a
venetian
i
said
to
him
in
french
so
i
am
like
myself
i
am
not
jesting
no
more
am
i
then
let
us
speak
in
venetian
do
you
begin
and
i
will
reply
we
began
our
conversation
but
when
he
came
to
the
word
sabato
saturday
which
is
a
sabo
in
venetian
i
discovered
that
he
was
a
real
venetian
but
not
from
venice
itself
he
said
i
was
right
and
that
he
judged
from
my
accent
that
i
came
from
venice
quite
so
said
i
i
thought
bernadi
was
the
only
venetian
besides
myself
in
st
petersburg
you
see
you
are
mistaken
my
name
is
count
volpati
di
treviso
give
me
your
address
and
i
will
come
and
tell
you
who
i
am
for
i
can
not
do
so
here
here
it
is
after
leaving
the
count
i
continued
my
progress
through
this
wonderful
hall
and
two
or
three
hours
after
i
was
attracted
by
the
voice
of
a
female
masquer
speaking
parisian
french
in
a
high
falsetto
such
as
is
common
at
an
opera
ball
i
did
not
recognize
the
voice
but
i
knew
the
style
and
felt
quite
certain
that
the
masquer
must
be
one
of
my
old
friends
for
she
spoke
with
the
intonations
and
phraseology
which
i
had
rendered
popular
in
my
chief
places
of
resort
at
paris
i
was
curious
to
see
who
it
could
be
and
not
wishing
to
speak
before
i
knew
her
i
had
the
patience
to
wait
till
she
lifted
her
mask
and
this
occurred
at
the
end
of
an
hour
what
was
my
surprise
to
see
madame
baret
the
of
the
rue
honor
my
love
awoke
from
its
long
sleep
and
coming
up
to
her
i
said
in
a
falsetto
voice
i
am
your
friend
of
the
she
was
puzzled
and
looked
the
picture
of
bewilderment
i
whispered
in
her
ear
gilbert
baret
rue
des
prouveres
and
certain
other
facts
which
could
only
be
known
to
herself
and
a
fortunate
lover
she
saw
i
knew
her
inmost
secrets
and
drawing
me
away
she
begged
me
to
tell
her
who
i
was
i
was
your
lover
and
a
fortunate
one
too
i
replied
but
before
i
tell
you
my
name
with
whom
are
you
and
how
are
you
very
well
but
pray
do
not
divulge
what
i
tell
you
i
left
paris
with
counsellor
in
the
court
of
rouen
i
lived
happily
enough
for
some
time
with
him
and
then
left
him
to
go
with
a
theatrical
manager
who
brought
me
here
as
an
actress
under
the
name
of
de
and
now
i
am
kept
by
count
rzewuski
the
polish
ambassador
and
now
tell
me
who
you
are
feeling
sure
of
enjoying
her
again
i
lifted
my
mask
she
gave
a
cry
of
joy
and
exclaimed
my
good
angel
has
brought
you
to
st
petersburg
how
do
you
mean
rzewuski
is
obliged
to
go
back
to
poland
and
now
i
count
on
you
to
get
me
out
of
the
country
for
i
can
no
longer
continue
in
a
station
for
which
i
was
not
intended
since
i
can
neither
sing
nor
act
she
gave
me
her
address
and
i
left
her
delighted
with
my
discovery
after
having
passed
half
an
hour
at
the
counter
eating
and
drinking
of
the
best
i
returned
to
the
crowd
and
saw
my
fair
talking
to
count
volpati
he
had
seen
her
with
me
and
hastened
to
enquire
my
name
of
her
however
she
was
faithful
to
our
mutual
promise
and
told
him
i
was
her
husband
though
the
venetian
did
not
seem
to
give
the
least
credence
to
this
piece
of
information
at
last
i
was
tired
and
left
the
ball
and
went
to
bed
intending
to
go
to
mass
in
the
morning
i
slept
for
some
time
and
woke
but
as
it
was
still
dark
i
turned
on
the
other
side
and
went
to
sleep
again
at
last
i
awoke
again
and
seeing
the
daylight
stealing
through
my
double
windows
i
sent
for
a
hairdresser
telling
my
man
to
make
haste
as
i
wanted
to
hear
mass
on
the
first
sunday
after
my
arrival
in
petersburg
but
sir
said
he
the
first
sunday
was
yesterday
we
are
at
monday
now
what
monday
yes
sir
i
had
spent
hours
in
bed
and
after
laughing
at
the
mishap
i
felt
as
if
i
could
easily
believe
it
for
my
hunger
was
like
that
of
a
cannibal
this
is
the
only
day
which
i
really
lost
in
my
life
but
i
do
not
weep
like
the
roman
emperor
i
laugh
but
this
is
not
the
only
difference
between
titus
and
casanova
i
called
on
demetrio
papanelopulo
the
greek
merchant
who
was
to
pay
me
a
hundred
roubles
a
month
i
was
also
commended
to
him
by
da
loglio
and
i
had
an
excellent
reception
he
begged
me
to
come
and
dine
with
him
every
day
paid
me
the
roubles
for
the
month
due
and
assured
me
that
he
had
honoured
my
bill
drawn
at
mitau
he
also
found
me
a
reliable
servant
and
a
carriage
at
eighteen
roubles
or
six
ducats
per
month
such
cheapness
has
alas
departed
for
ever
the
next
day
as
i
was
dining
with
the
worthy
greek
and
young
bernardi
who
was
afterwards
poisoned
count
volpati
came
in
with
the
dessert
and
told
us
how
he
had
met
a
venetian
at
the
ball
who
had
promised
to
come
and
see
him
the
venetian
would
have
kept
his
promise
said
i
if
he
had
not
had
a
long
sleep
of
hours
i
am
the
venetian
and
am
delighted
to
continue
our
acquaintance
the
count
was
about
to
leave
and
his
departure
had
already
been
announced
in
the
petersburg
gazette
the
russian
custom
is
not
to
give
a
traveller
his
passports
till
a
fortnight
has
elapsed
after
the
appearance
of
his
name
in
the
paper
this
regulation
is
for
the
advantage
of
tradesmen
while
it
makes
foreigners
think
twice
before
they
contract
any
debts
the
next
day
i
took
a
letter
of
introduction
to
pietro
ivanovitch
melissino
colonel
and
afterwards
general
of
artillery
the
letter
was
written
by
madame
da
loglio
who
was
very
intimate
with
melissino
i
was
most
politely
welcomed
and
after
presenting
me
to
his
pleasant
wife
he
asked
me
once
for
all
to
sup
with
him
every
night
the
house
was
managed
in
the
french
style
and
both
play
and
supper
were
conducted
without
any
ceremony
i
met
there
melissino
elder
brother
the
procurator
of
the
holy
synod
and
husband
of
the
princess
dolgorouki
faro
went
on
and
the
company
was
composed
of
trustworthy
persons
who
neither
boasted
of
their
gains
nor
bewailed
their
losses
to
anyone
and
so
there
was
no
fear
of
the
government
discovering
this
infringement
of
the
law
against
gaming
the
bank
was
held
by
baron
lefort
son
of
the
celebrated
admiral
of
peter
the
great
lefort
was
an
example
of
the
inconstancy
of
fortune
he
was
then
in
disgrace
on
account
of
a
lottery
which
he
had
held
at
moscow
to
celebrate
the
coronation
of
the
empress
who
had
furnished
him
with
the
necessary
funds
the
lottery
had
been
broken
and
the
fact
was
attributed
to
the
baron
supposed
dishonesty
i
played
for
small
stakes
and
won
a
few
roubles
i
made
friends
with
baron
lefort
at
supper
and
he
afterwards
told
me
of
the
vicissitudes
he
had
experienced
as
i
was
praising
the
noble
calmness
with
which
a
certain
prince
had
lost
a
thousand
roubles
to
him
he
laughed
and
said
that
the
fine
gamester
i
had
mentioned
played
upon
credit
but
never
paid
how
about
his
honour
it
is
not
affected
by
the
of
gaming
debts
it
is
an
understood
thing
in
russia
that
one
who
plays
on
credit
and
loses
may
pay
or
not
pay
as
he
wishes
and
the
winner
only
makes
himself
ridiculous
by
reminding
the
loser
of
his
debt
then
the
holder
of
the
bank
has
the
right
to
refuse
to
accept
bets
which
are
not
backed
by
ready
money
certainly
and
nobody
has
a
right
to
be
offended
with
him
for
doing
so
gaming
is
in
a
very
bad
state
in
russia
i
know
young
men
of
the
highest
rank
whose
chief
boast
is
that
they
know
how
to
conquer
fortune
that
is
to
cheat
one
of
the
matuschkins
goes
so
far
as
to
challenge
all
foreign
cheats
to
master
him
he
has
just
received
permission
to
travel
for
three
years
and
it
is
an
open
secret
that
he
wishes
to
travel
that
he
may
exercise
his
skill
he
intends
returning
to
russia
laden
with
the
spoils
of
the
dupes
he
has
made
a
young
officer
of
the
guards
named
zinowieff
a
relation
of
the
orloffs
whom
i
had
met
at
melissino
introduced
me
to
macartney
the
english
ambassador
a
young
man
of
parts
and
fond
of
pleasure
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
young
lady
of
the
chitroff
family
and
maid
of
honour
to
the
empress
and
finding
his
affection
reciprocated
a
baby
was
the
result
the
empress
disapproved
strongly
of
this
piece
of
english
freedom
and
had
the
ambassador
recalled
though
she
forgave
her
maid
of
honour
this
forgiveness
was
attributed
to
the
young
lady
skill
in
dancing
i
knew
the
brother
of
this
lady
a
fine
and
intelligent
young
officer
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
admitted
to
the
court
and
there
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
mdlle
chitroff
dancing
and
also
mdlle
sievers
now
princesss
whom
i
saw
again
at
dresden
four
years
ago
with
her
daughter
an
extremely
genteel
young
princess
i
was
enchanted
with
mdlle
sievers
and
felt
quite
in
love
with
her
but
as
we
were
never
introduced
i
had
no
opportunity
of
declaring
my
passion
putini
the
castrato
was
high
in
her
favour
as
indeed
he
deserved
to
be
both
for
his
talents
and
the
beauties
of
his
person
the
worthy
papanelopulo
introduced
me
to
alsuwieff
one
of
the
ministers
a
man
of
wit
and
letters
and
only
one
of
the
kind
whom
i
met
in
russia
he
had
been
an
industrious
student
at
the
university
of
upsala
and
loved
wine
women
and
good
cheer
he
asked
me
to
dine
with
locatelli
at
catherinhoff
one
of
the
imperial
mansions
which
the
empress
had
assigned
to
the
old
theatrical
manager
for
the
remainder
of
his
days
he
was
astonished
to
see
me
and
i
was
more
astonished
still
to
find
that
he
had
turned
taverner
for
he
gave
an
excellent
dinner
every
day
to
all
who
cared
to
pay
a
rouble
exclusive
of
wine
introduced
me
to
his
colleague
in
the
ministry
teploff
whose
vice
was
that
he
loved
boys
and
his
virtue
that
he
had
strangled
peter
iii
madame
mecour
the
dancer
introduced
me
to
her
lover
ghelaghin
also
a
minister
he
had
spent
twenty
years
of
his
life
in
siberia
a
letter
from
da
loglio
got
me
a
warm
welcome
from
the
castrato
luini
a
delightful
man
who
kept
a
splendid
table
he
was
the
lover
of
colonna
the
singer
but
their
affection
seemed
to
me
a
torment
for
they
could
scarce
live
together
in
peace
for
a
single
day
at
luini
house
i
met
another
castrato
millico
a
great
friend
of
the
chief
huntsman
narischkin
who
also
became
one
of
my
friends
this
narischkin
a
pleasant
and
a
man
was
the
husband
of
the
famous
maria
paulovna
it
was
at
the
chief
huntsman
splendid
table
that
i
met
calogeso
plato
now
archbishop
of
novgorod
and
then
chaplain
to
the
empress
this
monk
was
a
russian
and
a
master
of
ruses
understood
greek
and
spoke
latin
and
french
and
was
what
would
be
called
a
fine
man
it
was
no
wonder
that
he
rose
to
such
a
height
as
in
russia
the
nobility
never
lower
themselves
by
accepting
church
dignities
da
loglio
had
given
me
a
letter
for
the
princess
daschkoff
and
i
took
it
to
her
country
house
at
the
distance
of
three
versts
from
petersburg
she
had
been
exiled
from
the
capital
because
having
assisted
catherine
to
ascend
the
throne
she
claimed
to
share
it
with
her
i
found
the
princess
mourning
for
the
loss
of
her
husband
she
welcomed
me
kindly
and
promised
to
speak
to
panin
on
my
behalf
and
three
days
later
she
wrote
to
me
that
i
could
call
on
that
nobleman
as
soon
as
i
liked
this
was
a
specimen
of
the
empress
magnanimity
she
had
disgraced
the
princess
but
she
allowed
her
favourite
minister
to
pay
his
court
to
her
every
evening
i
have
heard
on
good
authority
that
panin
was
not
the
princess
lover
but
her
father
she
is
now
the
president
of
the
academy
of
science
and
i
suppose
the
literati
must
look
upon
her
as
another
minerva
or
else
they
would
be
ashamed
to
have
a
woman
at
their
head
for
completeness
sake
the
russians
should
get
a
woman
to
command
their
armies
but
joan
are
scarce
melissino
and
i
were
present
at
an
extraordinary
ceremony
on
the
day
of
the
epiphany
namely
the
blessing
of
the
neva
then
covered
with
five
feet
of
ice
after
the
benediction
of
the
waters
children
were
baptized
by
being
plunged
into
a
large
hole
which
had
been
made
in
the
ice
on
the
day
on
which
i
was
present
the
priest
happened
to
let
one
of
the
children
slip
through
his
hands
drugoi
he
cried
that
is
give
me
another
but
my
surprise
may
be
imagined
when
i
saw
that
the
father
and
mother
of
the
child
were
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
they
were
certain
that
the
babe
had
been
carried
straight
to
heaven
happy
ignorance
i
had
a
letter
from
the
florentine
madame
bregonci
for
her
friend
the
venetian
roccolini
who
had
left
venice
to
go
and
sing
at
the
petersburg
theatre
though
she
did
not
know
a
note
of
music
and
had
never
appeared
on
the
stage
the
empress
laughed
at
her
and
said
she
feared
there
was
no
opening
in
petersburg
for
her
peculiar
talents
but
the
roccolini
who
was
known
as
la
vicenza
was
not
the
woman
to
lose
heart
for
so
small
a
check
she
became
an
intimate
friend
of
a
frenchwoman
named
prote
the
wife
of
a
merchant
who
lived
with
the
chief
huntsman
she
was
at
the
same
time
his
mistress
and
the
confidante
of
his
wife
maria
petrovna
who
did
not
like
her
husband
and
was
very
much
obliged
to
the
frenchwoman
for
delivering
her
from
the
conjugal
importunities
this
prote
was
one
of
the
handsomest
women
i
have
ever
seen
and
undoubtedly
the
handsomest
in
petersburg
at
that
time
she
was
in
the
flower
of
her
age
she
had
at
once
a
wonderful
taste
for
gallantry
and
for
all
the
mysteries
of
the
toilette
in
dress
she
surpassed
everyone
and
as
she
was
witty
and
amusing
she
captivated
all
hearts
such
was
the
woman
whose
friend
and
procuress
la
vicenza
had
become
she
received
the
applications
of
those
who
were
in
love
with
madame
prote
and
passed
them
on
while
whether
a
lover
suit
was
accepted
or
not
the
procuress
got
something
out
of
him
i
recognized
signora
roccolini
as
soon
as
i
saw
her
but
as
twenty
years
had
elapsed
since
our
last
meeting
she
did
not
wonder
at
my
appearing
not
to
know
her
and
made
no
efforts
to
refresh
my
memory
her
brother
was
called
montellato
and
he
it
was
who
tried
to
assassinate
me
one
night
in
mark
square
as
i
was
leaving
the
ridotto
the
plot
that
would
have
cost
me
my
life
if
i
had
not
made
my
escape
from
the
window
was
laid
in
the
roccolini
house
she
welcomed
me
as
a
in
a
strange
land
told
me
of
her
struggles
and
added
that
now
she
had
an
easy
life
of
it
and
associated
with
the
pleasantest
ladies
in
petersburg
i
am
astonished
that
you
have
not
met
the
fair
madame
prote
at
the
chief
huntsman
for
she
is
the
darling
of
his
heart
come
and
take
coffee
with
me
and
you
shall
see
a
wonder
i
kept
the
appointment
and
i
found
the
lady
even
more
beautiful
than
the
venetian
praises
of
her
had
led
me
to
expect
i
was
dazzled
by
her
beauty
but
not
being
a
rich
man
i
felt
that
i
must
set
my
wits
to
work
if
i
wanted
to
enjoy
her
i
asked
her
name
though
i
knew
it
quite
well
and
she
replied
prote
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
madam
said
i
for
you
thereby
promise
to
be
mine
how
so
said
she
with
a
charming
smile
i
explained
the
pun
and
made
her
laugh
i
told
her
amusing
stories
and
let
her
know
the
effect
that
her
beauty
had
produced
on
me
and
that
i
hoped
time
would
soften
her
heart
to
me
the
acquaintance
was
made
and
thenceforth
i
never
went
to
narischkin
without
calling
on
her
either
before
or
after
dinner
the
polish
ambassador
returned
about
that
time
and
i
had
to
forego
my
enjoyment
of
the
fair
anglade
who
accepted
a
very
advantageous
proposal
which
was
made
her
by
count
brawn
this
charming
frenchwoman
died
of
the
a
few
months
later
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
her
death
was
a
blessing
as
she
would
have
fallen
into
misery
and
poverty
after
her
beauty
had
once
decayed
i
desired
to
succeed
with
madame
prote
and
with
that
idea
i
asked
her
to
dinner
at
locatelli
with
luini
colonna
zinowieff
signora
vicenza
and
a
violinist
her
lover
we
had
an
excellent
dinner
washed
down
with
plenty
of
wine
and
the
spirits
of
the
company
were
wound
up
to
the
pitch
i
desired
after
the
repast
each
gentleman
went
apart
with
his
lady
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
success
when
an
untoward
accident
interrupted
us
we
were
summoned
to
see
the
proofs
of
luini
prowess
he
had
gone
out
shooting
with
his
dogs
and
guns
as
i
was
walking
away
from
catherinhoff
with
zinowieff
i
noticed
a
young
whose
beauty
astonished
me
i
pointed
her
out
to
the
young
officer
and
we
made
for
her
but
she
fled
away
with
great
activity
to
a
little
cottage
where
we
followed
her
we
went
in
and
saw
the
father
mother
and
some
children
and
in
a
corner
the
timid
form
of
the
fair
maiden
zinowieff
who
by
the
way
was
for
twenty
years
russian
ambassador
at
madrid
had
a
long
conversation
in
russian
with
the
father
i
did
not
understand
what
was
said
but
i
guessed
it
referred
to
the
girl
because
when
her
father
called
her
she
advanced
submissively
and
stood
modestly
before
us
the
conversation
over
zinowieff
went
out
and
i
followed
him
after
giving
the
master
of
the
house
a
rouble
zinowieff
told
me
what
had
passed
saying
that
he
had
asked
the
father
if
he
would
let
him
have
the
daughter
as
a
and
the
father
had
replied
that
it
should
be
so
with
all
his
heart
but
that
he
must
have
a
hundred
roubles
for
her
as
she
was
still
a
virgin
so
you
see
added
zinowieff
the
matter
is
quite
simple
how
simple
why
yes
only
a
hundred
roubles
and
supposing
me
to
be
inclined
to
give
that
sum
then
she
would
be
your
servant
and
you
could
do
anything
you
liked
with
her
except
kill
her
and
supposing
she
is
not
willing
that
never
happens
but
if
it
did
you
could
have
beaten
her
well
if
she
is
satisfied
and
i
enjoy
her
can
i
still
continue
to
keep
her
you
will
be
her
master
i
tell
you
and
can
have
her
arrested
if
she
attempts
to
escape
unless
she
can
return
the
hundred
roubles
you
gave
for
her
what
must
i
give
her
per
month
nothing
except
enough
to
eat
and
drink
you
must
also
let
her
go
to
the
baths
on
saturday
and
to
the
church
on
sunday
can
i
make
her
come
with
me
when
i
leave
st
petersburg
no
unless
you
obtain
permission
and
find
a
surety
for
though
the
girl
would
be
your
slave
she
would
still
be
a
slave
to
the
empress
very
good
then
will
you
arrange
this
matter
for
me
i
will
give
the
hundred
roubles
and
i
promise
you
i
will
not
treat
her
as
a
slave
but
i
hope
you
will
care
for
my
interests
as
i
do
not
wish
to
be
duped
i
promise
you
you
shall
not
be
duped
i
will
see
to
everything
would
you
like
her
now
no
very
good
then
it
shall
be
we
returned
to
petersburg
in
a
phaeton
and
the
next
day
at
nine
i
called
on
zinowieff
who
said
he
was
delighted
to
do
me
this
small
service
on
the
way
he
said
that
if
i
liked
he
could
get
me
a
perfect
seraglio
of
pretty
girls
in
a
few
days
no
said
i
one
is
enough
and
i
gave
him
the
hundred
roubles
we
arrived
at
the
cottage
where
we
found
the
father
mother
and
daughter
zinowieff
explained
his
business
crudely
enough
after
the
custom
of
the
country
and
the
father
thanked
nicholas
for
the
good
luck
he
had
sent
him
he
spoke
to
his
daughter
who
looked
at
me
and
softly
uttered
the
necessary
yes
zinowieff
then
told
me
that
i
ought
to
ascertain
that
matters
were
intact
as
i
was
going
to
pay
for
a
virgin
i
was
afraid
of
offending
her
and
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
zinowieff
said
the
girl
would
be
mortified
if
i
did
not
examine
her
and
that
she
would
be
delighted
if
i
place
her
in
a
position
to
prove
before
her
father
and
mother
that
her
conduct
had
always
been
virtuous
i
therefore
made
the
examination
as
modestly
as
i
could
and
i
found
her
to
be
intact
to
tell
the
truth
i
should
not
have
said
anything
if
things
had
been
otherwise
zinowieff
then
gave
the
hundred
roubles
to
the
father
who
handed
them
to
his
daughter
and
she
only
took
them
to
return
them
to
her
mother
my
servant
and
coachman
were
then
called
in
to
witness
as
arrangement
of
which
they
knew
nothing
i
called
her
zaira
and
she
got
into
the
carriage
and
returned
with
me
to
petersburg
in
her
coarse
clothes
without
a
chemise
of
any
kind
after
i
had
dropped
zinowieff
at
his
lodging
i
went
home
and
for
four
days
i
was
engaged
in
collecting
and
arranging
my
slave
toilet
not
resting
till
i
had
dressed
her
modestly
in
the
french
style
in
less
than
three
months
she
had
learnt
enough
italian
to
tell
me
what
she
wanted
and
to
understand
me
she
soon
loved
me
and
afterwards
she
got
jealous
but
we
shall
hear
more
of
her
in
the
following
chapter
chapter
xx
crevecoeur
bomback
journey
to
moscow
my
adventures
at
petersburg
the
day
on
which
i
took
zaira
i
sent
lambert
away
for
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
him
he
got
drunk
every
day
and
when
in
his
cups
he
was
unbearable
nobody
would
have
anything
to
say
to
him
except
as
a
common
soldier
and
that
is
not
an
enviable
position
in
russia
i
got
him
a
passport
for
berlin
and
gave
him
enough
money
for
the
journey
i
heard
afterwards
that
he
entered
the
austrian
service
in
may
zaira
had
become
so
beautiful
that
when
i
went
to
moscow
i
dared
not
leave
her
behind
me
so
i
took
her
in
place
of
a
servant
it
was
delicious
to
me
to
hear
her
chattering
in
the
venetian
dialect
i
had
taught
her
on
a
saturday
i
would
go
with
her
to
the
bath
where
thirty
of
forty
naked
men
and
women
were
bathing
together
without
the
slightest
constraint
this
absence
of
shame
must
arise
i
should
imagine
from
native
innocence
but
i
wondered
that
none
looked
at
zaira
who
seemed
to
me
the
original
of
the
statue
of
psyche
i
had
seen
at
the
villa
borghese
at
rome
she
was
only
fourteen
so
her
breast
was
not
yet
developed
and
she
bore
about
her
few
traces
of
puberty
her
skin
was
as
white
as
snow
and
her
ebony
tresses
covered
the
whole
of
her
body
save
in
a
few
places
where
the
dazzling
whiteness
of
her
skin
shone
through
her
eyebrows
were
perfectly
shaped
and
her
eyes
though
they
might
have
been
larger
could
not
have
been
more
brilliant
or
more
expressive
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
furious
jealousy
and
her
blind
confidence
in
by
cards
which
she
consulted
every
day
zaira
would
have
been
a
paragon
among
women
and
i
should
never
have
left
her
a
young
and
frenchman
came
to
petersburg
with
a
young
parisian
named
la
riviere
who
was
tolerably
pretty
but
quite
devoid
of
education
unless
it
were
that
education
common
to
all
the
girls
who
sell
their
charms
in
paris
this
young
man
came
to
me
with
a
letter
from
prince
charles
of
courland
who
said
that
if
i
could
do
anything
for
the
young
couple
he
would
be
grateful
to
me
they
arrived
just
as
i
was
breakfasting
with
zaira
you
must
tell
me
said
i
to
the
young
frenchman
in
what
way
i
can
be
of
use
to
you
by
admitting
us
to
your
company
and
introducing
us
to
your
friends
well
i
am
a
stranger
here
and
i
will
come
and
see
you
and
you
can
come
and
see
me
and
i
shall
be
delighted
but
i
never
dine
at
home
as
to
my
friends
you
must
feel
that
being
a
stranger
i
could
not
introduce
you
and
the
lady
is
she
your
wife
people
will
ask
me
who
you
are
and
what
you
are
doing
at
petersburg
what
am
i
to
say
i
wonder
prince
charles
did
not
send
you
to
someone
else
i
am
a
gentleman
of
lorraine
and
madame
la
riviere
is
my
mistress
and
my
object
in
coming
to
petersburg
is
to
amuse
myself
then
i
do
know
to
whom
i
could
introduce
you
under
the
circumstances
but
i
should
think
you
will
be
able
to
find
plenty
of
amusement
without
knowing
anyone
the
theatres
the
streets
and
even
the
court
entertainments
are
open
to
everyone
i
suppose
you
have
plenty
of
money
that
exactly
what
i
have
got
and
i
do
expect
any
either
well
i
have
not
much
more
but
you
really
astonish
me
how
could
you
have
been
so
foolish
as
to
come
here
without
money
well
my
mistress
said
we
could
do
with
what
money
we
got
from
day
to
day
she
induced
me
to
leave
paris
without
a
farthing
and
up
to
now
it
seems
to
me
that
she
is
right
we
have
managed
to
get
on
somehow
then
she
has
the
purse
my
purse
said
she
is
in
the
pockets
of
my
friends
i
understand
and
i
am
sure
you
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
wherewithal
to
live
if
i
had
such
a
purse
it
should
be
opened
for
you
but
i
am
not
a
rich
man
bomback
a
citizen
of
hamburg
whom
i
had
known
in
england
whence
he
had
fled
on
account
of
his
debts
had
come
to
petersburg
and
entered
the
army
he
was
the
son
of
a
rich
merchant
and
kept
up
a
house
a
carriage
and
an
army
of
servants
he
was
a
lover
of
good
cheer
women
and
gambling
and
contracted
debts
everywhere
he
was
an
ugly
man
but
full
of
wit
and
energy
he
happened
to
call
on
me
just
as
i
was
addressing
the
strange
traveller
whose
purse
was
in
the
pocket
of
her
friends
i
introduced
the
couple
to
him
telling
the
whole
story
the
item
of
the
purse
excepted
the
adventure
was
just
to
bomback
taste
and
he
began
making
advances
to
madame
la
riviere
who
received
them
in
a
thoroughly
professional
spirit
and
i
was
inwardly
amused
and
felt
that
her
axiom
was
a
true
one
bomback
asked
them
to
dine
with
him
the
next
day
and
begged
them
to
come
and
take
an
unceremonious
dinner
the
same
day
with
him
at
crasnacaback
i
was
included
in
the
invitation
and
zaira
not
understanding
french
asked
me
what
we
were
talking
about
and
on
my
telling
her
expressed
a
desire
to
accompany
me
i
gave
in
to
appease
her
for
i
knew
the
wish
proceeded
from
jealousy
and
that
if
i
did
not
consent
i
should
be
tormented
by
tears
reproaches
melancholy
etc
this
had
occurred
several
times
before
and
so
violent
had
she
been
that
i
had
been
compelled
to
conform
to
the
custom
of
the
country
and
beat
her
strange
to
say
i
could
not
have
taken
a
better
way
to
prove
my
love
such
is
the
character
of
the
russian
women
after
the
blows
had
been
given
by
slow
degrees
she
became
affectionate
again
and
a
love
encounter
sealed
the
reconciliation
bomback
left
us
to
make
his
preparations
in
high
spirits
and
while
zaira
was
dressing
madame
riviere
talked
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
me
almost
think
that
i
was
absolutely
deficient
in
knowledge
of
the
world
the
astonishing
thing
was
that
her
lover
did
not
seem
in
the
least
ashamed
of
the
part
he
had
to
play
he
might
say
that
he
was
in
love
with
the
messalina
but
the
excuse
would
not
have
been
admissible
the
party
was
a
merry
one
bomback
talked
to
the
adventuress
zaira
sat
on
my
knee
and
crevecoeur
ate
and
drank
laughed
in
season
and
out
of
season
and
walked
up
and
down
the
crafty
madame
riviere
incited
bomback
to
risk
roubles
at
quinze
he
lost
and
paid
pleasantly
and
only
got
a
kiss
for
his
money
zaira
who
was
delighted
to
be
able
to
watch
over
me
and
my
fidelity
jested
pleasantly
on
the
frenchwoman
and
the
complaisance
of
her
lover
this
was
altogether
beyond
her
comprehension
and
she
could
not
understand
how
he
could
bear
such
deeds
as
were
done
before
his
face
the
next
day
i
went
to
bomback
by
myself
as
i
was
sure
of
meeting
young
russian
officers
who
would
have
annoyed
me
by
making
love
to
zaira
in
their
own
language
i
found
the
two
travellers
and
the
brothers
lunin
then
lieutenants
but
now
generals
the
younger
of
them
was
as
fair
and
pretty
as
any
girl
he
had
been
the
beloved
of
the
minister
teploff
and
like
a
lad
of
wit
he
not
only
was
not
ashamed
but
openly
boasted
that
it
was
his
custom
to
secure
the
of
all
men
by
his
caresses
he
had
imagined
the
rich
citizen
of
hamburg
to
be
of
the
same
tastes
as
teploff
and
he
had
not
been
mistaken
and
so
he
degraded
me
by
forming
the
same
supposition
with
this
idea
he
seated
himself
next
to
me
at
table
and
behaved
himself
in
such
a
manner
during
dinner
that
i
began
to
believe
him
to
be
a
girl
in
man
clothes
after
dinner
as
i
was
sitting
at
the
fire
between
him
and
the
frenchman
i
imparted
my
suspicions
to
him
but
jealous
of
the
superiority
of
his
sex
he
displayed
proof
of
it
on
the
spot
and
forthwith
got
hold
of
me
and
put
himself
in
a
position
to
make
my
happiness
and
his
own
as
he
called
it
i
confess
to
my
shame
that
he
might
perhaps
have
succeeded
if
madame
la
riviere
indignant
at
this
encroachment
of
her
peculiar
province
had
not
made
him
desist
lunin
the
elder
crevecceur
and
bomback
who
had
been
for
a
walk
returned
at
nightfall
with
two
or
three
friends
and
easily
consoled
the
frenchman
for
the
poor
entertainment
the
younger
lunin
and
myself
had
given
him
bomback
held
a
bank
at
faro
which
only
came
to
an
end
at
eleven
when
the
money
was
all
gone
we
then
supped
and
the
real
orgy
began
in
which
la
riviere
bore
the
brunt
in
a
manner
that
was
simply
astonishing
i
and
my
friend
lunin
were
merely
spectators
and
poor
crevecoeur
had
gone
to
bed
we
did
not
separate
till
i
got
home
and
fortunately
for
myself
escaped
the
bottle
which
zaira
flung
at
my
head
and
which
would
infallibly
have
killed
me
if
it
had
hit
me
she
threw
herself
on
to
the
ground
and
began
to
strike
it
with
her
forehead
i
thought
she
had
gone
mad
and
wondered
whether
i
had
better
call
for
assistance
but
she
became
quiet
enough
to
call
me
assassin
and
traitor
with
all
the
other
abusive
epithets
that
she
could
remember
to
convict
me
of
my
crime
she
shewed
me
cards
placed
in
order
and
on
them
she
displayed
the
various
enormities
of
which
i
had
been
guilty
i
let
her
go
on
till
her
rage
was
somewhat
exhausted
and
then
having
thrown
her
divining
apparatus
into
the
fire
i
looked
at
her
in
pity
and
anger
and
said
that
we
must
part
the
next
day
as
she
had
narrowly
escaped
killing
me
i
confessed
that
i
had
been
with
bomback
and
that
there
had
been
a
girl
in
the
house
but
i
denied
all
the
other
sins
of
which
she
accused
me
i
then
went
to
sleep
without
taking
the
slightest
notice
of
her
in
spite
of
all
she
said
and
did
to
prove
her
repentance
i
woke
after
a
few
hours
to
find
her
sleeping
soundly
and
i
began
to
consider
how
i
could
best
rid
myself
of
the
girl
who
would
probably
kill
me
if
we
continued
living
together
whilst
i
was
absorbed
in
these
thoughts
she
awoke
and
falling
at
my
feet
wept
and
professed
her
utter
repentance
and
promised
never
to
touch
another
card
as
long
as
i
kept
her
at
last
i
could
resist
her
entreaties
no
longer
so
i
took
her
in
my
arms
and
forgave
her
and
we
did
not
part
till
she
had
received
undeniable
proofs
of
the
return
of
my
affection
i
intended
to
start
for
moscow
in
three
days
and
she
was
delighted
when
she
heard
she
was
to
go
three
circumstances
had
won
me
this
young
girl
furious
affection
in
the
first
place
i
often
took
her
to
see
her
family
with
whom
i
always
left
a
rouble
in
the
second
i
made
her
eat
with
me
and
in
the
third
i
had
beaten
her
three
or
four
times
when
she
had
tried
to
prevent
me
going
out
in
russia
beating
is
a
matter
of
necessity
for
words
have
no
force
whatever
a
servant
mistress
or
courtezan
understands
nothing
but
the
lash
words
are
altogether
thrown
away
but
a
few
good
strokes
are
entirely
efficacious
the
servant
whose
soul
is
still
more
enslaved
than
his
body
reasons
somewhat
as
follows
after
he
has
had
a
beating
my
master
has
not
sent
me
away
but
beaten
me
therefore
he
loves
me
and
i
ought
to
be
attached
to
him
it
is
the
same
with
the
russian
soldier
and
in
fact
with
everybody
honour
stands
for
nothing
but
with
the
knout
and
brandy
one
can
get
anything
from
them
except
heroical
enthusiasm
papanelopulo
laughed
at
me
when
i
said
that
as
i
liked
my
cossack
i
should
endeavour
to
correct
him
with
words
only
when
he
took
too
much
brandy
if
you
do
not
beat
him
he
said
he
will
end
by
beating
you
and
he
spoke
the
truth
one
day
when
he
was
so
drunk
as
to
be
unable
to
attend
on
me
i
began
to
scold
him
and
threatened
him
with
the
stick
if
he
did
not
mend
his
ways
as
soon
as
he
saw
my
cane
lifted
he
ran
at
me
and
got
hold
of
it
and
if
i
had
not
knocked
him
down
immediately
he
would
doubtless
have
beaten
me
i
dismissed
him
on
the
spot
there
is
not
a
better
servant
in
the
world
than
a
russian
he
works
without
ceasing
sleeps
in
front
of
the
door
of
his
master
bedroom
to
be
always
ready
to
fulfil
his
orders
never
answering
his
reproaches
incapable
of
theft
but
after
drinking
a
little
too
much
brandy
he
becomes
a
perfect
monster
and
drunkenness
is
the
vice
of
the
whole
nation
a
coachman
knows
no
other
way
of
resisting
the
bitter
cold
to
which
he
is
exposed
than
by
drinking
rye
brandy
it
sometimes
happens
that
he
drinks
till
he
falls
asleep
and
then
there
is
no
awaking
for
him
in
this
world
unless
one
is
very
careful
it
is
easy
to
lose
an
ear
the
nose
a
cheek
or
a
lip
by
frost
bites
one
day
as
i
was
walking
out
on
a
bitterly
cold
day
a
russian
noticed
that
one
of
my
ears
was
frozen
he
ran
up
to
me
and
rubbed
the
affected
part
with
a
handful
of
snow
till
the
circulation
was
restored
i
asked
him
how
he
had
noticed
my
state
and
he
said
he
had
remarked
the
livid
whiteness
of
my
ear
and
this
he
said
was
always
a
sign
that
the
frost
had
taken
it
what
surprised
me
most
of
all
is
that
sometimes
the
part
grows
again
after
it
has
dropped
off
prince
charles
of
courland
assured
me
that
he
had
cost
his
nose
in
siberia
and
that
it
had
grown
again
the
next
summer
i
have
been
assured
of
the
truth
of
this
by
several
russians
about
this
time
the
empress
made
the
architect
rinaldi
who
had
been
fifty
years
in
petersburg
build
her
an
enormous
wooden
amphitheatre
so
large
as
to
cover
the
whole
of
the
space
in
front
of
the
palace
it
would
contain
a
hundred
thousand
spectators
and
in
it
catherine
intended
to
give
a
vast
tournament
to
all
the
knights
of
her
empire
there
were
to
be
four
parties
of
a
hundred
knights
each
and
all
the
cavaliers
were
to
be
clad
in
the
national
costume
of
the
nations
they
represented
all
the
russians
were
informed
of
this
great
festival
which
was
to
be
given
at
the
expense
of
the
sovereign
and
the
princes
counts
and
barons
were
already
arriving
with
their
chargers
from
the
most
remote
parts
of
the
empire
prince
charles
of
courland
wrote
informing
me
of
his
intention
to
be
present
it
had
been
ordained
that
the
tournament
should
take
place
on
the
first
fine
day
and
this
precaution
was
a
very
wise
one
for
excepting
in
the
season
of
the
hard
frosts
a
day
without
rain
or
snow
or
wind
is
a
marvel
in
italy
spain
and
france
one
can
reckon
on
fine
weather
and
bad
weather
is
the
exception
but
it
is
quite
the
contrary
in
russia
ever
since
i
have
known
this
home
of
frost
and
the
cold
north
wind
i
laugh
when
i
hear
travelling
russians
talking
of
the
fine
climate
of
their
native
country
however
it
is
a
pardonable
weakness
most
of
us
prefer
mine
to
thine
nobles
affect
to
consider
themselves
of
purer
blood
than
the
peasants
from
whom
they
sprang
and
the
romans
and
other
ancient
nations
pretended
that
they
were
the
children
of
the
gods
to
draw
a
veil
over
their
actual
ancestors
who
were
doubtless
robbers
the
truth
is
that
during
the
whole
year
there
was
not
one
fine
day
in
russia
or
in
ingria
at
all
events
and
the
mere
proofs
of
this
statement
may
be
found
in
the
fact
that
the
tournament
was
not
held
in
that
year
it
was
postponed
till
the
next
and
the
princes
counts
barons
and
knights
spent
the
winter
in
the
capital
unless
their
purses
forbade
them
to
indulge
in
the
luxuries
of
court
life
the
dear
prince
of
courland
was
in
this
case
to
my
great
disappointment
having
made
all
arrangements
for
my
journey
to
moscow
i
got
into
my
sleeping
carriage
with
zaira
having
a
servant
behind
who
could
speak
both
russian
and
german
for
roubles
the
chevochic
hirer
out
of
horses
engaged
to
carry
me
to
moscow
in
six
days
and
seven
nights
with
six
horses
this
struck
me
as
being
extremely
cheap
the
distance
is
russian
stages
almost
equivalent
to
five
hundred
italian
miles
or
a
hundred
and
sixty
french
leagues
we
set
out
just
as
a
cannon
shot
from
the
citadel
announced
the
close
of
day
it
was
towards
the
end
of
may
in
which
month
there
is
literally
no
night
at
petersburg
without
the
report
of
the
cannon
no
one
would
be
able
to
tell
when
the
day
ended
and
the
night
began
one
can
read
a
letter
at
midnight
and
the
moonlight
makes
no
appreciable
difference
this
continual
day
lasts
for
eight
weeks
and
during
that
time
no
one
lights
a
candle
at
moscow
it
is
different
a
candle
is
always
necessary
at
midnight
if
one
wished
to
read
we
reached
novgorod
in
hours
and
here
the
chevochic
allowed
us
a
rest
of
five
hours
i
saw
a
circumstance
there
which
surprised
me
very
much
though
one
has
no
business
to
be
surprised
at
anything
if
one
travels
much
and
especially
in
a
land
of
half
savages
i
asked
the
chevochic
to
drink
but
he
appeared
to
be
in
great
melancholy
i
enquired
what
was
the
matter
and
he
told
zaira
that
one
of
his
horses
had
refused
to
eat
and
that
it
was
clear
that
if
he
could
not
eat
he
could
not
work
we
followed
him
into
the
stable
and
found
the
horse
looking
oppressed
by
care
its
head
lowered
and
motionless
it
had
evidently
got
no
appetite
his
master
began
a
pathetic
oration
looking
tenderly
at
the
animal
as
if
to
arouse
it
to
a
sense
of
duty
and
then
taking
its
head
and
kissing
it
lovingly
he
put
it
into
the
manger
but
to
no
purpose
then
the
man
began
to
weep
bitterly
but
in
such
a
way
that
i
had
the
greatest
difficulty
to
prevent
myself
laughing
for
i
could
see
that
he
wept
in
the
hope
that
his
tears
might
soften
the
brute
heart
when
he
had
wept
some
time
he
again
put
the
horse
head
into
the
manger
but
again
to
no
purpose
at
this
he
got
furious
and
swore
to
be
avenged
he
led
the
horse
out
of
the
stable
tied
it
to
a
post
and
beat
it
with
a
thick
stick
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
so
violently
that
my
heart
bled
for
the
poor
animal
at
last
the
chevochic
was
tired
out
and
taking
the
horse
back
to
the
stable
he
fastened
up
his
head
once
more
and
to
my
astonishment
it
began
to
devour
its
provender
with
the
greatest
appetite
at
this
the
master
jumped
for
joy
laughed
sang
and
committed
a
thousand
extravagancies
as
if
to
shew
the
horse
how
happy
it
had
made
him
i
was
beside
myself
with
astonishment
and
concluded
that
such
treatment
would
have
succeeded
nowhere
but
in
russia
where
the
stick
seems
to
be
the
panacea
or
universal
medicine
they
tell
me
however
that
the
stick
is
gradually
going
out
of
fashion
peter
the
great
used
to
beat
his
generals
black
and
blue
and
in
his
days
a
lieutenant
had
to
receive
with
all
submission
the
cuffs
of
his
captain
who
bent
before
the
blows
of
his
major
who
did
the
same
to
his
colonel
who
received
chastisement
from
his
general
so
i
was
informed
by
old
general
woyakoff
who
was
a
pupil
of
peter
the
great
and
had
often
been
beaten
by
the
great
emperor
the
founder
of
petersburg
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
scarcely
said
anything
about
this
great
and
famous
capital
which
in
my
opinion
is
built
on
somewhat
precarious
foundations
no
one
but
peter
could
have
thus
given
the
lie
to
nature
by
building
his
immense
palaces
of
marble
and
granite
on
mud
and
shifting
sand
they
tell
me
that
the
town
is
now
in
its
manhood
to
the
honour
of
the
great
catherine
but
in
the
year
it
was
still
in
its
minority
and
seemed
to
me
only
to
have
been
built
with
the
childish
aim
of
seeing
it
fall
into
ruins
streets
were
built
with
the
certainty
of
having
to
repair
them
in
six
months
time
the
whole
place
proclaimed
itself
to
be
the
whim
of
a
despot
if
it
is
to
be
durable
constant
care
will
be
required
for
nature
never
gives
up
its
rights
and
reasserts
them
when
the
constraint
of
man
is
withdrawn
my
theory
is
that
sooner
or
later
the
soil
must
give
way
and
drag
the
vast
city
with
it
we
reached
moscow
in
the
time
the
chevochic
had
promised
as
the
same
horses
were
used
for
the
whole
journey
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
travel
mote
quickly
a
russian
told
me
that
the
empress
elizabeth
had
done
the
journey
in
hours
you
mean
that
she
issued
a
ukase
to
the
effect
that
she
had
done
it
said
a
russian
of
the
old
school
and
if
she
had
liked
she
could
have
travelled
more
quickly
still
it
was
only
a
question
of
the
wording
of
the
ukase
even
when
i
was
in
russia
it
was
not
allowable
to
doubt
the
infallibility
of
a
ukase
and
to
do
so
was
equivalent
to
high
treason
one
day
i
was
crossing
a
canal
at
petersburg
by
a
small
wooden
bridge
melissino
papanelopulo
and
some
other
russians
were
with
me
i
began
to
abuse
the
wooden
bridge
which
i
characterized
as
both
mean
and
dangerous
one
of
my
companions
said
that
on
such
a
day
it
would
be
replaced
by
a
fine
stone
bridge
as
the
empress
had
to
pass
there
on
some
state
occasion
the
day
named
way
three
weeks
off
and
i
said
plainly
that
it
was
impossible
one
of
the
russians
looked
askance
at
me
and
said
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
as
a
ukase
had
been
published
ordering
that
the
bridge
should
be
built
i
was
going
to
answer
him
but
papanelopulo
gave
my
hand
a
squeeze
and
whispered
taci
hush
the
bridge
was
not
built
but
i
was
not
justified
for
the
empress
published
another
ukase
in
which
she
declared
it
to
be
her
gracious
pleasure
that
the
bridge
should
not
be
built
till
the
following
year
if
anyone
would
see
what
a
pure
despotism
is
like
let
him
go
to
russia
the
russian
sovereigns
use
the
language
of
despotism
on
all
occasions
one
day
i
saw
the
empress
dressed
in
man
clothes
going
out
for
a
ride
her
master
of
the
horse
prince
repnin
held
the
bridle
of
the
horse
which
suddenly
gave
him
a
kick
which
broke
his
anklebone
the
empress
instantly
ordained
that
the
horse
should
be
taken
away
and
that
no
one
should
mount
it
again
under
pain
of
death
all
official
positions
in
russia
have
military
rank
assigned
to
them
and
this
sufficiently
indicates
the
nature
of
the
government
the
of
her
imperial
highness
holds
the
rank
of
colonel
as
also
does
her
chief
cook
the
castrato
luini
was
a
and
the
painter
toretti
only
a
captain
because
he
had
only
eight
hundred
roubles
a
year
while
the
coachman
had
three
thousand
the
sentinels
at
the
doors
of
the
palace
have
their
muskets
crossed
and
ask
those
who
wish
to
pass
through
what
is
their
rank
when
i
was
asked
this
question
i
stopped
short
but
the
officer
asked
me
how
much
i
had
a
year
and
on
my
replying
at
a
hazard
three
thousand
roubles
he
gave
me
the
rank
of
general
and
i
was
allowed
to
pass
i
saw
the
czarina
for
a
moment
she
stopped
at
the
door
and
took
off
her
gloves
to
give
her
hands
to
be
kissed
by
the
officer
and
the
two
sentinels
by
such
means
as
this
she
had
won
the
affection
of
the
corps
commanded
by
gregorius
gregorovitch
orloff
on
which
her
safety
depended
in
case
of
revolution
i
made
the
following
notes
when
i
saw
the
empress
hearing
mass
in
her
chapel
the
protopapa
or
bishop
received
her
at
the
door
to
give
her
the
holy
water
and
she
kissed
his
episcopal
ring
while
the
prelate
whose
beard
was
a
couple
of
feet
in
length
lowered
his
head
to
kiss
the
hands
of
his
temporal
sovereign
and
spiritual
head
for
in
russia
the
he
or
she
on
the
throne
is
the
spiritual
as
well
as
temporal
head
of
the
church
she
did
not
evidence
the
least
devotion
during
mass
hypocrisy
did
not
seem
to
be
one
of
her
vices
now
she
smiled
at
one
of
her
suite
now
at
another
and
occasionally
she
addressed
the
favourite
not
because
she
had
anything
to
say
to
him
but
to
make
him
an
object
of
envy
to
the
others
one
evening
as
she
was
leaving
the
theatre
where
metastasio
olympiade
had
been
performed
i
heard
her
say
the
music
of
that
opera
has
given
the
greatest
pleasure
to
everyone
so
of
course
i
am
delighted
with
it
but
it
wearies
me
nevertheless
music
is
a
fine
thing
but
i
can
not
understand
how
anyone
who
is
seriously
occupied
can
love
it
passionately
i
will
have
buranello
here
and
i
wonder
whether
he
will
interest
me
in
music
but
i
am
afraid
nature
did
not
constitute
me
to
feel
all
its
charms
she
always
argued
in
that
way
in
due
time
i
will
set
down
her
words
to
me
when
i
returned
from
moscow
when
i
arrived
at
that
city
i
got
down
at
a
good
inn
where
they
gave
me
two
rooms
and
a
for
my
carriage
after
dinner
i
hired
a
small
carriage
and
a
guide
who
could
speak
french
my
carriage
was
drawn
by
four
horses
for
moscow
is
a
vast
city
composed
of
four
distinct
towns
and
many
of
the
streets
are
rough
and
i
had
five
or
six
letters
of
introduction
and
i
determined
to
take
them
all
i
took
zaira
with
me
as
she
was
as
curious
to
see
everything
as
a
girl
of
fourteen
naturally
is
i
do
not
remember
what
feast
the
greek
church
was
keeping
on
that
day
but
i
shall
never
forget
the
terrific
with
which
my
ears
were
assailed
for
there
are
churches
every
where
the
country
people
were
engaged
in
sowing
their
grain
to
reap
it
in
september
they
laughed
at
our
southern
custom
of
sowing
eight
months
earlier
as
unnecessary
and
even
prejudicial
to
the
crops
but
i
do
not
know
where
the
right
lies
perhaps
we
may
both
be
right
for
there
is
no
master
to
compare
with
experience
i
took
all
the
introductions
i
had
received
from
narischkin
prince
repnin
the
worthy
pananelopulo
and
melissino
brother
the
next
morning
the
whole
of
the
persons
at
whose
houses
i
had
left
letters
called
on
me
they
all
asked
zaira
and
myself
to
dinner
and
i
accepted
the
invitation
of
the
first
comer
dinidoff
and
promised
to
dine
with
the
rest
on
the
following
days
zaira
who
had
been
tutored
by
me
to
some
extent
was
delighted
to
shew
me
that
she
was
worthy
of
the
position
she
occupied
she
was
exquisitely
dressed
and
won
golden
opinions
everywhere
for
our
hosts
did
not
care
to
enquire
whether
she
were
my
daughter
my
mistress
or
my
servant
for
in
this
matter
as
in
many
others
the
russians
are
excessively
indulgent
those
who
have
not
seen
moscow
have
not
seen
russia
for
the
people
of
st
petersburg
are
not
really
russians
at
all
their
court
manners
are
very
different
from
their
manners
naturel
and
it
may
be
said
with
truth
that
the
true
russian
is
as
a
stranger
in
petersburg
the
citizens
of
moscow
and
especially
the
rich
ones
speak
with
pity
of
those
who
for
one
reason
or
another
had
expatriated
themselves
and
with
them
to
expatriate
one
self
is
to
leave
moscow
which
they
consider
as
their
native
land
they
look
on
petersburg
with
an
envious
eye
and
call
it
the
ruin
of
russia
i
do
not
know
whether
this
is
a
just
view
to
take
of
the
case
i
merely
repeat
what
i
have
heard
in
the
course
of
a
week
i
saw
all
the
sights
of
moscow
the
manufacturers
the
churches
the
remains
of
the
old
days
the
museums
the
libraries
of
no
interest
to
my
mind
not
forgetting
the
famous
bell
i
noticed
that
their
bells
are
not
allowed
to
swing
like
ours
but
are
motionless
being
rung
by
a
rope
attached
to
the
clapper
i
thought
the
moscow
women
more
handsome
than
those
of
petersburg
and
i
attribute
this
to
the
great
superiority
of
the
air
they
are
gentle
and
accessible
by
nature
and
to
obtain
the
favour
of
a
kiss
on
the
lips
one
need
only
make
a
show
of
kissing
their
hands
there
was
good
fare
in
plenty
but
no
delicacy
in
its
composition
or
arrangement
their
table
is
always
open
to
friends
and
acquaintances
and
a
friend
may
bring
to
five
or
six
persons
to
dinner
and
even
at
the
end
of
the
meals
you
will
never
hear
a
russian
say
we
have
had
dinner
you
have
come
too
late
their
souls
are
not
black
enough
for
them
to
pronounce
such
words
as
this
notice
is
given
to
the
cook
and
the
dinner
begins
over
again
they
have
a
delicious
drink
the
name
of
which
i
do
not
remember
but
it
is
much
superior
to
the
sherbet
of
constantinople
the
numerous
servants
are
not
given
water
but
a
light
nourishing
and
agreeable
fluid
which
may
be
purchased
very
cheaply
they
all
hold
nicholas
in
the
greatest
reverence
only
praying
to
god
through
the
mediation
of
this
saint
whose
picture
is
always
suspended
in
the
principal
room
of
the
house
a
person
coming
in
makes
first
a
bow
to
the
image
and
then
a
bow
to
the
master
and
if
perchance
the
image
is
absent
the
russian
after
gazing
all
round
stands
confused
and
motionless
not
knowing
what
to
do
as
a
general
rule
the
muscovites
are
the
most
superstitious
christians
in
the
world
their
liturgy
is
in
greek
of
which
the
people
understand
nothing
and
the
clergy
themselves
extremely
ignorant
gladly
leave
them
completely
in
the
dark
on
all
matters
connected
with
religion
i
could
never
make
them
understand
that
the
only
reason
for
the
roman
christians
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
from
left
to
right
while
the
greeks
make
it
from
right
to
left
is
that
we
say
sancti
while
they
say
pneuma
if
you
said
pneuma
agion
i
used
to
say
then
you
would
cross
yourself
like
us
and
if
we
said
sancti
spiritus
we
should
cross
ourselves
like
you
the
adjective
replied
my
interlocutor
should
always
precede
the
substantive
for
we
should
never
utter
the
name
of
god
without
first
giving
him
some
honourable
epithet
such
are
nearly
all
the
differences
which
divide
the
two
churches
without
reckoning
the
numerous
idle
tales
which
they
have
as
well
as
ourselves
and
which
are
by
no
means
the
least
cherished
articles
of
their
faith
we
returned
to
petersburg
by
the
way
we
had
come
but
zaira
would
have
liked
me
never
to
leave
moscow
she
had
become
so
much
in
love
with
me
by
force
of
constant
association
that
i
could
not
think
without
a
pang
of
the
moment
of
separation
the
day
after
our
arrival
in
the
capital
i
took
her
to
her
home
where
she
shewed
her
father
all
the
little
presents
i
had
given
her
and
told
him
of
the
honour
she
had
received
as
my
daughter
which
made
the
good
man
laugh
heartily
the
first
piece
of
news
i
heard
was
that
a
ukase
had
been
issued
ordering
the
erection
of
a
temple
dedicated
to
god
in
the
moscoi
opposite
to
the
house
where
i
resided
the
empress
had
entrusted
rinaldi
the
architect
with
the
erection
he
asked
her
what
emblem
he
should
put
above
the
portal
and
she
replied
no
emblem
at
all
only
the
name
of
god
in
large
letters
i
will
put
a
triangle
no
triangle
at
all
but
only
the
name
of
god
in
whatever
language
you
like
and
nothing
more
the
second
piece
of
news
was
that
bomback
had
fled
and
had
been
captured
at
mitau
where
he
believed
himself
in
safety
de
simolia
had
arrested
him
it
was
a
grave
case
for
he
had
deserted
however
he
was
given
his
life
and
sent
into
barracks
at
kamstchatka
crevecoeur
and
his
mistress
had
departed
carrying
some
money
with
them
and
a
florentine
adventurer
named
billotti
had
fled
with
eighteen
thousand
roubles
belonging
to
papanelopulo
but
a
certain
bori
the
worthy
greek
factotum
had
caught
him
at
mitau
and
brought
him
back
to
petersburg
where
he
was
now
in
prison
prince
charles
of
courland
arrived
about
this
time
and
i
hastened
to
call
upon
him
as
soon
as
he
advised
me
of
his
coming
he
was
lodging
in
a
house
belonging
to
count
dimidoff
who
owned
large
iron
mines
and
had
made
the
whole
house
of
iron
from
attic
to
basement
the
prince
had
brought
his
mistress
with
him
but
she
was
still
in
an
and
he
was
beginning
to
get
heartily
sick
of
her
the
man
was
to
be
pitied
for
he
could
not
get
rid
of
her
without
finding
her
a
husband
and
this
husband
became
more
difficult
to
find
every
day
when
the
prince
saw
how
happy
i
was
with
my
zaira
he
could
not
help
thinking
how
easily
happiness
may
be
won
but
the
fatal
desire
for
luxury
and
empty
show
spoils
all
and
renders
the
very
sweets
of
life
as
bitter
as
gall
i
was
indeed
considered
happy
and
i
liked
to
appear
so
but
in
my
heart
i
was
wretched
ever
since
my
imprisonment
under
the
leads
i
had
been
subject
to
haemorrhoids
which
came
on
three
or
four
times
a
year
at
petersburg
i
had
a
serious
attack
and
the
daily
pain
and
anxiety
embittered
my
existence
a
vegetarian
doctor
called
senapios
for
whom
i
had
sent
gave
me
the
sad
news
that
i
had
a
blind
or
incomplete
fistula
in
the
rectum
and
according
to
him
nothing
but
the
cruel
pistoury
would
give
me
any
relief
and
indeed
he
said
i
had
no
time
to
lose
i
had
to
agree
in
spite
of
my
dislike
to
the
operation
but
fortunately
the
clever
surgeon
whom
the
doctor
summoned
pronounced
that
if
i
would
have
patience
nature
itself
would
give
me
relief
i
had
much
to
endure
especially
from
the
severe
dieting
to
which
i
was
subjected
but
which
doubtless
did
me
good
colonel
melissino
asked
me
to
be
present
at
a
review
which
was
to
take
place
at
three
versts
from
petersburg
and
was
to
be
succeeded
by
a
dinner
to
guests
given
by
general
orloff
i
went
with
the
prince
and
saw
a
cannon
fired
twenty
times
in
a
minute
testing
the
performance
with
my
watch
my
neighbour
at
dinner
was
the
french
ambassador
wishing
to
drink
deeply
after
the
russian
fashion
and
thinking
the
hungarian
wine
as
innocent
as
champagne
he
drank
so
bravely
that
at
the
end
of
dinner
he
had
lost
the
use
of
his
legs
count
orloff
made
him
drink
still
more
and
then
he
fell
asleep
and
was
laid
on
a
bed
the
gaiety
of
the
meal
gave
me
some
idea
of
russian
wit
i
did
not
understand
the
language
so
zinowieff
translated
the
curious
sallies
to
me
while
the
applause
they
had
raised
was
still
resounding
melissino
rose
to
his
feet
holding
a
large
goblet
full
of
hungarian
wine
in
his
hand
there
was
a
general
silence
to
listen
to
him
he
drank
the
health
of
general
orloff
in
these
words
may
you
die
when
you
become
rich
the
applause
was
general
for
the
allusion
was
to
the
unbounded
generosity
of
orloff
the
general
reply
struck
me
as
better
still
but
it
was
equally
rugged
in
character
he
too
took
a
full
cup
and
turning
to
melissino
said
may
you
never
die
till
i
slay
you
the
applause
was
furious
for
he
was
their
host
and
their
general
the
russian
wit
is
of
the
energetic
kind
devoid
of
grace
all
they
care
about
is
directness
and
vigour
voltaire
had
just
sent
the
empress
his
philosophy
of
history
which
he
had
written
for
her
and
dedicated
to
her
a
month
after
an
edition
of
three
thousand
copies
came
by
sea
and
was
sold
out
in
a
week
for
all
the
russians
who
knew
a
little
french
were
eager
to
possess
a
copy
of
the
work
the
leaders
of
the
voltaireans
were
two
noblemen
named
respectively
stroganoff
and
schuvaloff
i
have
seen
verses
written
by
the
former
of
these
as
good
as
voltaire
own
verses
and
twenty
years
later
i
saw
an
ode
by
the
latter
of
which
voltaire
would
not
have
been
ashamed
but
the
subject
was
ill
chosen
for
it
treated
of
the
death
of
the
great
philosopher
who
had
so
studiously
avoided
using
his
pen
on
melancholy
themes
in
those
days
all
russians
with
any
pretensions
to
literature
read
nothing
but
voltaire
and
when
they
had
read
all
his
writings
they
thought
themselves
as
wise
as
their
master
to
me
they
seemed
pigmies
mimicking
a
giant
i
told
them
that
they
ought
to
read
all
the
books
from
which
voltaire
had
drawn
his
immense
learning
and
then
perhaps
they
might
become
as
wise
as
he
i
remember
the
saying
of
a
wise
man
at
rome
beware
of
the
man
of
one
book
i
wonder
whether
the
russians
are
more
profound
now
but
that
is
a
question
i
can
not
answer
at
dresden
i
knew
prince
biloselski
who
was
on
his
way
back
to
russia
after
having
been
ambassador
at
turin
he
was
the
author
of
an
admirable
world
on
metaphysics
and
the
analysis
of
the
soul
and
reason
count
panin
was
the
tutor
of
paul
petrovitch
to
the
throne
the
young
prince
had
a
severe
master
and
dared
not
even
applaud
an
air
at
the
opera
unless
he
first
received
permission
to
do
so
from
his
mentor
when
a
courier
brought
the
news
of
the
sudden
death
of
francis
emperor
of
germany
and
of
the
holy
roman
empire
the
czarina
being
at
the
count
was
in
the
palace
with
his
pupil
then
eleven
years
old
the
courier
came
at
noon
and
gave
the
dispatch
into
the
hands
of
the
minister
who
was
standing
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
of
courtiers
of
whom
i
was
one
the
prince
imperial
was
at
his
right
hand
the
minister
read
the
dispatch
in
a
low
voice
and
then
said
this
is
news
indeed
the
emperor
of
the
romans
has
died
suddenly
he
then
turned
to
paul
and
said
to
him
full
court
mourning
which
your
highness
will
observe
for
three
months
longer
than
the
empress
why
so
said
paul
because
as
duke
of
holstein
your
highness
has
a
right
to
attend
the
diet
of
the
empire
a
privilege
he
added
turning
to
us
which
peter
the
great
desired
in
vain
i
noted
the
attention
with
which
the
grand
duke
paul
listened
to
his
mentor
and
the
care
with
which
he
concealed
his
joy
at
the
news
i
was
immensely
pleased
with
this
way
of
giving
instruction
i
said
as
much
to
prince
lobkowitz
who
was
standing
by
me
and
he
refined
on
my
praises
this
prince
was
popular
with
everyone
he
was
even
preferred
to
his
predecessor
prince
esterhazy
and
this
was
saying
a
great
deal
for
esterhazy
was
adored
in
russia
the
gay
and
affable
manner
of
prince
lobkowitz
made
him
the
life
and
soul
of
all
the
parties
at
which
he
was
present
he
was
a
constant
courtier
of
the
countess
braun
the
reigning
beauty
and
everyone
believed
his
love
had
been
crowned
with
success
though
no
one
could
assert
as
much
positively
there
was
a
great
review
held
at
a
distance
of
twelve
or
fourteen
versts
from
petersburg
at
which
the
empress
and
all
her
train
of
courtiers
were
present
the
houses
of
the
two
or
three
adjoining
villages
were
so
few
and
small
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
all
the
company
to
find
a
lodging
nevertheless
i
wished
to
be
present
chiefly
to
please
zaira
who
wanted
to
be
seen
with
me
on
such
an
occasion
the
review
was
to
last
three
days
there
were
to
be
fireworks
and
a
mine
was
to
be
exploded
besides
the
evolutions
of
the
troops
i
went
in
my
travelling
carriage
which
would
serve
me
for
a
lodging
if
i
could
get
nothing
better
we
arrived
at
the
appointed
place
at
eight
in
the
morning
the
evolutions
lasted
till
noon
when
they
were
over
we
went
towards
a
tavern
and
had
our
meal
served
to
us
in
the
carriage
as
all
the
rooms
in
the
inn
were
full
after
dinner
my
coachman
tried
in
vain
to
find
me
a
lodging
so
i
disposed
myself
to
sleep
all
night
in
the
carriage
and
so
i
did
for
the
whole
time
of
the
review
and
fared
better
than
those
who
had
spent
so
much
money
to
be
ill
lodged
melissino
told
me
that
the
empress
thought
my
idea
a
very
sensible
one
as
i
was
the
only
person
who
had
a
sleeping
carriage
which
was
quite
a
portable
house
in
itself
i
had
numerous
visitors
and
zaira
was
radiant
to
be
able
to
do
the
honours
i
had
a
good
deal
of
conversation
during
the
review
with
count
tott
brother
of
the
nobleman
who
was
employed
at
constantinople
and
known
as
baron
tott
we
had
known
each
other
at
paris
and
afterwards
at
the
hague
where
i
had
the
pleasure
of
being
of
service
to
him
he
had
come
to
petersburg
with
madame
de
soltikoff
whom
he
had
met
at
paris
and
whose
lover
he
was
he
lived
with
her
went
to
court
and
was
well
received
by
everyone
two
or
three
years
after
the
empress
ordered
him
to
leave
petersburg
on
account
of
the
troubles
in
poland
it
was
said
that
he
kept
up
a
correspondence
with
his
brother
who
was
endeavouring
to
intercept
the
fleet
under
the
command
of
alexis
orloff
i
never
heard
what
became
of
him
after
he
left
russia
where
he
obliged
me
with
the
loan
of
five
hundred
roubles
which
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
return
to
him
maruzzi
by
calling
a
venetian
merchant
and
by
birth
a
greek
having
left
trade
to
live
like
a
gentleman
came
to
petersburg
when
i
was
there
and
was
presented
at
court
he
was
a
man
and
was
admitted
to
all
the
great
houses
the
empress
treated
him
with
distinction
because
she
had
thoughts
of
making
him
her
agent
at
venice
he
paid
his
court
to
the
countess
braun
but
he
had
rivals
there
who
were
not
afraid
of
him
he
was
rich
enough
but
did
not
know
how
to
spend
his
money
and
avarice
is
a
sin
which
meets
with
no
pity
from
the
russian
ladies
i
went
to
peterhoff
and
cronstadt
for
if
you
want
to
say
you
have
been
in
a
country
you
should
see
as
much
as
possible
of
it
i
wrote
notes
and
memorandums
on
several
questions
with
the
hope
of
their
procuring
me
a
place
in
the
civil
service
and
all
my
productions
were
laid
before
the
empress
but
with
no
effect
in
russia
they
do
not
think
much
of
foreigners
unless
they
have
specially
summoned
them
those
who
come
of
their
own
account
rarely
make
much
and
i
suspect
the
russians
are
right
chapter

and

at

the

and

the

theatrical
intrigues
byanicki
i
thought
of
leaving
russia
at
the
beginning
of
the
autumn
but
i
was
told
by
m
panin
and
alsuwieff
that
i
ought
not
to
go
without
having
spoken
to
the
empress
i
should
be
sorry
to
do
so
i
replied
but
as
i
ca
find
anyone
to
present
me
to
her
i
must
be
resigned
at
last
panin
told
me
to
walk
in
a
garden
frequented
by
her
majesty
at
an
early
hour
and
he
said
that
meeting
me
as
it
were
by
chance
she
would
probably
speak
to
me
i
told
him
i
should
like
him
to
be
with
her
and
he
accordingly
named
a
day
i
repaired
to
the
garden
and
as
i
walked
about
i
marvelled
at
the
statuary
it
contained
all
the
statues
being
made
of
the
worst
stone
and
executed
in
the
worst
possible
taste
the
names
cut
beneath
them
gave
the
whole
the
air
of
a
practical
joke
a
weeping
statue
was
democritus
another
with
grinning
mouth
was
labelled
heraclitus
an
old
man
with
a
long
beard
was
sappho
and
an
old
woman
avicenna
and
so
on
as
i
was
smiling
at
this
extraordinary
collection
i
saw
the
czarina
preceded
by
count
gregorius
orloff
and
followed
by
two
ladies
approaching
count
panin
was
on
her
left
hand
i
stood
by
the
hedge
to
let
her
pass
but
as
soon
as
she
came
up
to
me
she
asked
smilingly
if
i
had
been
interested
in
the
statues
i
replied
following
her
steps
that
i
presumed
they
had
been
placed
there
to
impose
on
fools
or
to
excite
the
laughter
of
those
acquainted
with
history
from
what
i
can
make
out
she
replied
the
secret
of
the
matter
is
that
my
worthy
aunt
was
imposed
on
and
indeed
she
did
not
trouble
herself
much
about
such
trifles
but
i
hope
you
have
seen
other
things
in
russia
less
ridiculous
than
these
statues
i
entertained
the
sovereign
for
more
than
an
hour
with
my
remarks
on
the
things
of
note
i
had
seen
in
petersburg
the
conversation
happened
to
turn
on
the
king
of
prussia
and
i
sang
his
praises
but
i
censured
his
terrible
habit
of
always
interrupting
the
person
whom
he
was
addressing
catherine
smiled
and
asked
me
to
tell
her
about
the
conversation
i
had
had
with
this
monarch
and
i
did
so
to
the
best
of
my
ability
she
was
then
kind
enough
to
say
that
she
had
never
seen
me
at
the
courtag
which
was
a
vocal
and
instrumental
concert
given
at
the
palace
and
open
to
all
i
told
her
that
i
had
only
attended
once
as
i
was
so
unfortunate
as
not
to
have
a
taste
for
music
at
this
she
turned
to
panin
and
said
smilingly
that
she
knew
someone
else
who
had
the
same
misfortune
if
the
reader
remembers
what
i
heard
her
say
about
music
as
she
was
leaving
the
opera
he
will
pronounce
my
speech
to
have
been
a
very
one
and
i
confess
it
was
but
who
can
resist
making
such
speeches
to
a
monarch
and
above
all
a
monarch
in
petticoats
the
czarina
turned
from
me
to
speak
to
bezkoi
who
had
just
come
up
and
as
panin
left
the
garden
i
did
so
too
delighted
with
the
honour
i
had
had
the
empress
who
was
a
woman
of
moderate
height
and
yet
of
a
majestic
appearance
thoroughly
understood
the
art
of
making
herself
loved
she
was
not
beautiful
but
yet
she
was
sure
of
pleasing
by
her
geniality
and
her
wit
and
also
by
that
exquisite
tact
which
made
one
forget
the
awfulness
of
the
sovereign
in
the
gentleness
of
the
woman
a
few
days
after
count
partin
told
me
that
the
empress
had
twice
asked
after
me
and
that
this
was
a
sure
sign
i
had
pleased
her
he
advised
me
to
look
out
for
another
opportunity
of
meeting
her
and
said
that
for
the
future
she
would
always
tell
me
to
approach
whenever
she
saw
me
and
that
if
i
wanted
some
employment
she
might
possible
do
something
for
me
though
i
did
not
know
what
employ
i
could
ask
for
in
that
disagreeable
country
i
was
glad
to
hear
that
i
could
have
easy
access
to
the
court
with
that
idea
i
walked
in
the
garden
every
day
and
here
follows
my
second
conversation
with
the
empress
she
saw
me
at
a
distance
and
sent
an
officer
to
fetch
me
into
her
presence
as
everybody
was
talking
of
the
tournament
which
had
to
be
postponed
on
account
of
the
bad
weather
she
asked
me
if
this
kind
of
entertainment
could
be
given
at
venice
i
told
her
some
amusing
stories
on
the
subject
of
shows
and
spectacles
and
in
this
relation
i
remarked
that
the
venetian
climate
was
more
pleasant
than
the
russian
for
at
venice
fine
days
were
the
rule
while
at
petersburg
they
were
the
exception
though
the
year
is
younger
there
than
anywhere
else
yes
she
said
in
your
country
it
is
eleven
days
older
would
it
not
be
worthy
of
your
majesty
to
put
russia
on
an
equality
with
the
rest
of
the
world
in
this
respect
by
adopting
the
gregorian
calendar
all
the
protestants
have
done
so
and
england
who
adopted
it
fourteen
years
ago
has
already
gained
several
millions
all
europe
is
astonished
that
the
old
style
should
be
suffered
to
exist
in
a
country
where
the
sovereign
is
the
head
of
the
church
and
whose
capital
contains
an
academy
of
science
it
is
thought
that
peter
the
great
who
made
the
year
begin
in
january
would
have
also
abolished
the
old
style
if
he
had
not
been
afraid
of
offending
england
which
then
kept
trade
and
commerce
alive
throughout
your
vast
empire
you
know
she
replied
with
a
sly
smile
that
peter
the
great
was
not
exactly
a
learned
man
he
was
more
than
a
man
of
learning
the
immortal
peter
was
a
genius
of
the
first
order
instinct
supplied
the
place
of
science
with
him
his
judgment
was
always
in
the
right
his
vast
genius
his
firm
resolve
prevented
him
from
making
mistakes
and
helped
him
to
destroy
all
those
abuses
which
threatened
to
oppose
his
great
designs
her
majesty
seemed
to
have
heard
me
with
great
interest
and
was
about
to
reply
when
she
noticed
two
ladies
whom
she
summoned
to
her
presence
to
me
she
said
i
shall
be
delighted
to
reply
to
you
at
another
time
and
then
turned
towards
the
ladies
the
time
came
in
eight
or
ten
days
when
i
was
beginning
to
think
she
had
had
enough
of
me
for
she
had
seen
me
without
summoning
me
to
speak
to
her
she
began
by
saying
what
i
desired
should
be
done
was
done
already
all
the
letters
sent
to
foreign
countries
and
all
the
important
state
records
are
marked
with
both
dates
but
i
must
point
out
to
your
majesty
that
by
the
end
of
the
century
the
difference
will
be
of
twelve
days
not
eleven
not
at
all
we
have
seen
to
that
the
last
year
of
this
century
will
not
be
counted
as
a
leap
year
it
is
fortunate
that
the
difference
is
one
of
eleven
days
for
as
that
is
the
number
which
is
added
every
year
to
the
epact
our
epacts
are
almost
the
same
as
to
the
celebration
of
easter
that
is
a
different
question
your
equinox
is
on
march
the
ours
on
the
and
the
astronomers
say
we
are
both
wrong
sometimes
it
is
we
who
are
wrong
and
sometimes
you
as
the
equinox
varies
you
know
you
are
not
even
in
agreement
with
the
jews
whose
calculation
is
said
to
be
perfectly
accurate
and
in
fine
this
difference
in
the
time
of
celebrating
easter
does
not
disturb
in
any
way
public
order
or
the
progress
of
the
government
your
majesty
words
fill
me
with
admiration
but
the
festival
of
christmas
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
say
that
we
do
not
celebrate
christmas
in
the
winter
solstice
as
should
properly
be
done
we
know
it
but
it
seems
to
me
a
matter
of
no
account
i
would
rather
bear
with
this
small
mistake
than
grievously
afflict
vast
numbers
of
my
subjects
by
depriving
them
of
their
birthdays
if
i
did
so
there
would
be
no
open
complaints
uttered
as
that
is
not
the
fashion
in
russia
but
they
would
say
in
secret
that
i
was
an
atheist
and
that
i
disputed
the
infallibility
of
the
council
of
nice
you
may
think
such
complaints
matter
for
laughter
but
i
do
not
for
i
have
much
more
agreeable
motives
for
amusement
the
czarina
was
delighted
to
mark
my
surprise
i
did
not
doubt
for
a
moment
that
she
had
made
a
special
study
of
the
whole
subject
alsuwieff
told
me
a
few
days
after
that
she
had
very
possibly
read
a
little
pamphlet
on
the
subject
the
statements
of
which
exactly
coincided
with
her
own
he
took
care
to
add
however
that
it
was
very
possible
her
highness
was
profoundly
learned
on
the
matter
but
this
was
merely
a
courtier
phrase
what
she
said
was
spoken
modestly
and
energetically
and
her
good
humour
and
pleasant
smile
remained
unmoved
throughout
she
exercised
a
constant
over
herself
and
herein
appeared
the
greatness
of
her
character
for
nothing
is
more
difficult
her
demeanour
so
different
from
that
of
the
prussian
king
shewed
her
to
be
the
greater
sovereign
of
the
two
her
frank
geniality
always
gave
her
the
advantage
while
the
short
curt
manners
of
the
king
often
exposed
him
to
being
made
a
dupe
in
an
examination
of
the
life
of
frederick
the
great
one
can
not
help
paying
a
deserved
tribute
to
his
courage
but
at
the
same
time
one
feels
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
repeated
turns
of
good
fortune
he
must
have
succumbed
whereas
catherine
was
little
indebted
to
the
favours
of
the
blind
deity
she
succeeded
in
enterprises
which
before
her
time
would
have
been
pronounced
impossibilities
and
it
seemed
her
aim
to
make
men
look
upon
her
achievements
as
of
small
account
i
read
in
one
of
our
modern
journals
those
monuments
of
editorial
that
catherine
the
great
died
happily
as
she
had
lived
everybody
knows
that
she
died
suddenly
on
her
close
stool
by
calling
such
a
death
happy
the
journalist
hints
that
it
is
the
death
he
himself
would
wish
for
everyone
to
his
taste
and
we
can
only
hope
that
the
editor
may
obtain
his
wish
but
who
told
this
silly
fellow
that
catherine
desired
such
a
death
if
he
regards
such
a
wish
as
natural
to
a
person
of
her
profound
genius
i
would
ask
who
told
him
that
men
of
genius
consider
a
sudden
death
to
be
a
happy
one
is
it
because
that
is
his
opinion
and
are
we
to
conclude
that
he
is
therefore
person
of
genius
to
come
to
the
truth
we
should
have
to
interrogate
the
late
empress
and
ask
her
some
such
question
as
are
you
well
pleased
to
have
died
suddenly
she
would
probably
reply
what
a
foolish
question
such
might
be
the
wish
of
one
driven
to
despair
or
of
someone
suffering
from
a
long
and
grievous
malady
such
was
not
my
position
for
i
enjoyed
the
blessings
of
happiness
and
good
health
no
worse
fate
could
have
happened
to
me
my
sudden
death
prevented
me
from
concluding
several
designs
which
i
might
have
brought
to
a
successful
issue
if
god
had
granted
me
the
warning
of
a
slight
illness
but
it
was
not
so
i
had
to
set
out
on
the
long
journey
at
a
moment
notice
without
the
time
to
make
any
preparations
is
my
death
any
the
happier
from
my
not
foreseeing
it
do
you
think
me
such
a
coward
as
to
dread
the
approach
of
what
is
common
to
all
i
tell
you
that
i
should
have
accounted
myself
happy
if
i
had
had
a
respite
of
but
a
day
then
i
should
not
complain
of
the
divine
justice
does
your
highness
accuse
god
of
injustice
then
what
boots
it
since
i
am
a
lost
soul
do
you
expect
the
damned
to
acknowledge
the
justice
of
the
decree
which
has
consigned
them
to
eternal
woe
no
doubt
it
is
a
difficult
matter
but
i
should
have
thought
that
a
sense
of
the
justice
of
your
doom
would
have
mitigated
the
pains
of
it
perhaps
so
but
a
damned
soul
must
be
without
consolation
for
ever
in
spite
of
that
there
are
some
philosophers
who
call
you
happy
in
your
death
by
virtue
of
its
suddenness
not
philosophers
but
fools
for
in
its
suddenness
was
the
pain
and
woe
well
said
but
may
i
ask
your
highness
if
you
admit
the
possibility
of
a
happy
eternity
after
an
unhappy
death
or
of
an
unhappy
doom
after
a
happy
death
such
suppositions
are
inconceivable
the
happiness
of
futurity
lies
in
the
ecstasy
of
the
soul
in
feeling
freed
from
the
trammels
of
matter
and
unhappiness
is
the
doom
of
a
soul
which
was
full
of
remorse
at
the
moment
it
left
the
body
but
enough
for
my
punishment
forbids
my
farther
speech
tell
me
at
least
what
is
the
nature
of
your
punishment
an
everlasting
weariness
farewell
after
this
long
and
fanciful
digression
the
reader
will
no
doubt
be
obliged
by
my
returning
to
this
world
count
panin
told
me
that
in
a
few
days
the
empress
would
leave
for
her
country
house
and
i
determined
to
have
an
interview
with
her
foreseeing
that
it
would
be
for
the
last
time
i
had
been
in
the
garden
for
a
few
minutes
when
heavy
rain
began
to
fall
and
i
was
going
to
leave
when
the
empress
summoned
me
into
an
apartment
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
palace
where
she
was
walking
up
and
down
with
gregorovitch
and
a
maid
of
honour
i
had
forgotten
to
ask
you
she
said
graciously
if
you
believe
the
new
calculation
of
the
calendar
to
be
exempt
from
error
no
your
majesty
but
the
error
is
so
minute
that
it
will
not
produce
any
sensible
effect
for
the
space
of
nine
or
ten
thousand
years
i
thought
so
and
in
my
opinion
pope
gregory
should
not
have
acknowledged
any
mistake
at
all
the
pope
however
had
much
less
difficulty
in
carrying
out
his
reform
than
i
should
have
with
my
subjects
who
are
too
fond
of
their
ancient
usages
and
customs
nevertheless
i
am
sure
your
majesty
would
meet
with
obedience
no
doubt
but
imagine
the
grief
of
my
clergy
in
not
being
able
to
celebrate
the
numerous
saints
days
which
would
fall
on
the
eleven
days
to
be
suppressed
you
have
only
one
saint
for
each
day
but
we
have
a
dozen
at
least
i
may
remark
also
that
all
ancient
states
and
kingdoms
are
attached
to
their
ancient
laws
i
have
heard
that
your
republic
of
venice
begins
the
year
in
march
and
that
seems
to
me
as
it
were
a
monument
and
memorial
of
its
antiquity
and
indeed
the
year
begins
more
naturally
in
march
than
in
january
but
does
not
this
usage
cause
some
confusion
none
at
all
your
majesty
the
letters
m
v
which
we
adjoin
to
all
dates
in
january
and
february
render
all
mistakes
impossible
venice
is
also
noteworthy
for
its
peculiar
system
of
heraldry
by
the
amusing
form
under
which
it
portrays
its
patron
saint
and
by
the
five
latin
words
with
which
the
evangelist
is
invoked
in
which
as
i
am
told
there
is
a
grammatical
blunder
which
has
become
respectable
by
its
long
standing
but
is
it
true
that
you
do
not
distinguish
between
the
day
and
night
hours
it
is
your
majesty
and
what
is
more
we
reckon
the
day
from
the
beginning
of
the
night
such
is
the
force
of
custom
which
makes
us
admire
what
other
nations
think
ridiculous
you
see
no
inconvenience
in
your
division
of
the
day
which
strikes
me
as
most
inconvenient
you
would
only
have
to
look
at
your
watch
and
you
would
not
need
to
listen
for
the
cannon
shot
which
announces
the
close
of
day
yes
but
for
this
one
advantage
you
have
over
us
we
have
two
over
you
we
know
that
at
twelve
it
is
either
or
midnight
the
czarina
spoke
to
me
about
the
fondness
of
the
venetians
for
games
of
chance
and
asked
if
the
genoa
lottery
had
been
established
there
i
have
been
asked
she
added
to
allow
the
lottery
to
be
established
in
my
own
dominions
but
i
should
never
permit
it
except
on
the
condition
that
no
stake
should
be
below
a
rouble
and
then
the
poor
people
would
not
be
able
to
risk
their
money
in
it
i
replied
to
this
discreet
observation
with
a
profound
inclination
of
the
head
and
thus
ended
my
last
interview
with
the
famous
empress
who
reigned
years
without
committing
a
single
mistake
of
any
importance
the
historian
will
always
place
her
amongst
great
sovereigns
though
the
moralist
will
always
consider
her
and
rightly
as
one
of
the
most
notable
of
dissolute
women
a
few
days
before
i
left
i
gave
an
entertainment
to
my
friends
at
catherinhoff
winding
up
with
a
fine
display
of
fireworks
a
present
from
my
friend
melissino
my
supper
for
thirty
was
exquisite
and
my
ball
a
brilliant
one
in
spite
of
the
tenuity
of
my
purse
i
felt
obliged
to
give
my
friends
this
mark
of
my
gratitude
for
the
kindness
they
had
lavished
on
me
i
left
russia
with
the
actress
valville
and
i
must
here
tell
the
reader
how
i
came
to
make
her
acquaintance
i
happened
to
go
to
the
french
play
and
to
find
myself
seated
next
to
an
extremely
pretty
lady
who
was
unknown
to
me
i
occasionally
addressed
an
observation
to
her
referring
to
the
play
or
actors
and
i
was
immensely
delighted
with
her
spirited
answers
her
expression
charmed
me
and
i
took
the
liberty
of
asking
her
if
she
were
a
russian
no
thank
god
she
replied
i
am
a
parisian
and
an
actress
by
occupation
my
name
is
valville
but
i
do
wonder
i
am
unknown
to
you
for
i
have
been
only
a
month
here
and
have
played
but
once
how
is
that
because
i
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
fail
to
win
the
czarina
favour
however
as
i
was
engaged
for
a
year
she
has
kindly
ordered
that
my
salary
of
a
hundred
roubles
shall
be
paid
monthly
at
the
end
of
the
year
i
shall
get
my
passport
and
go
i
am
sure
the
empress
thinks
she
is
doing
you
a
favour
in
paying
you
for
nothing
very
likely
but
she
does
not
remember
that
i
am
forgetting
how
to
act
all
this
time
you
ought
to
tell
her
that
i
only
wish
she
would
give
me
an
audience
that
is
unnecessary
of
course
you
have
a
lover
no
i
have
it
incredible
to
me
they
say
the
incredible
often
happens
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
myself
i
took
her
address
and
sent
her
the
following
note
the
next
day
madam
i
should
like
to
begin
an
intrigue
with
you
you
have
inspired
me
with
feelings
that
will
make
me
unhappy
unless
you
reciprocate
them
i
beg
to
take
the
liberty
of
asking
myself
to

as
my
question
in
two
hours
i
received
this
reply
sir
as
i
have
the
knack
of
putting
an
end
to
an
intrigue
when
it
has
ceased
to
amuse
me
i
have
no
hesitation
in
accepting
your
proposal
as
to
the
sentiments

plain
speaking
on
a
match
with
yours
good
bye
till
the
evening
i
found
my
new
friend
in
a
comfortable
lodging
and
we
accosted
each
other
as
if
we
had
been
old
acquaintances
i
shall
be
delighted
to
travel
with
you
said
she
but
i
do
think
you
will
be
able
to
get
my
passport
i
have
no
doubt
as
to
my
success
i
replied
if
you
will
present
to
the
empress
the
petition
i
shall
draft
for
you
i
will
surely
do
so
said
she
giving
me
writing
materials
i
wrote
out
the
following
petition
your
majesty
i
venture
to
remind
your
highness
that
my
enforced
idleness
is
making
me
forget
my
art
which
i
have
not
yet
learnt
thoroughly
your
majesty
generosity
is
therefore
doing
me
an
injury
and
your
majesty
would
do
me
a
great
benefit
in
giving
me
permission
to
leave
st
petersburg
nothing
more
than
that
not
a
word
you
say
nothing
about
the
passport
and
nothing
about
the
i
am
not
a
rich
woman
do
you
only
present
this
petition
and
unless
i
am
very
much
mistaken
you
will
have
not
only
your
but
also
your
year
salary
oh
that
would
be
too
much
not
at
all
you
do
not
know
catherine
but
i
do
have
this
copied
and
present
it
in
person
i
will
copy
it
out
myself
for
i
can
write
a
good
enough
hand
indeed
it
almost
seems
as
if
i
had
composed
it
it
is
exactly
my
style
i
believe
you
are
a
better
actor
than
i
am
and
from
this
evening
i
shall
call
myself
your
pupil
come
let
us
have
some
supper
that
you
may
give
me
my
first
lesson
after
a
delicate
supper
seasoned
by
pleasant
and
witty
talk
madame
valville
granted
me
all
i
could
desire
i
went
downstairs
for
a
moment
to
send
away
my
coachman
and
to
instruct
him
what
he
was
to
say
to
zaira
whom
i
had
forewarned
that
i
was
going
to
cronstadt
and
might
not
return
till
the
next
day
my
coachman
was
a
ukrainian
on
whose
fidelity
i
could
rely
but
i
knew
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
be
off
with
the
old
love
before
i
was
on
with
the
new
madame
valville
was
like
most
young
frenchwomen
of
her
class
she
had
charms
which
she
wished
to
turn
to
account
and
a
passable
education
her
ambition
was
to
be
kept
by
one
man
and
the
title
of
mistress
was
more
pleasing
in
her
ears
than
that
of
wife
in
the
intervals
of
four
amorous
combats
she
told
me
enough
of
her
life
for
me
to
divine
what
it
had
been
clerval
the
actor
had
been
gathering
together
a
company
of
actors
at
paris
and
making
her
acquaintance
by
chance
and
finding
her
to
be
intelligent
he
assured
her
that
she
was
a
born
actress
though
she
had
never
suspected
it
the
idea
had
dazzled
her
and
she
had
signed
the
agreement
she
started
from
paris
with
six
other
actors
and
actresses
of
whom
she
was
the
only
one
that
had
never
played
i
thought
she
said
it
was
like
what
is
done
at
paris
where
a
girl
goes
into
the
chorus
or
the
ballet
without
having
learnt
to
sing
or
dance
what
else
could
i
think
after
an
actor
like
clerval
had
assured
me
i
had
a
talent
for
acting
and
had
offered
me
a
good
engagement
all
he
required
of
me
was
that
i
should
learn
by
heart
and
repeat
certain
passages
which
i
rehearsed
in
his
presence
he
said
i
made
a
capital
soubrette
and
he
certainly
could
not
have
been
trying
to
deceive
me
but
the
fact
is
he
was
deceived
himself
a
fortnight
after
my
arrival
i
made
my
first
appearance
and
my
reception
was
not
a
flattering
one
perhaps
you
were
nervous
nervous
not
in
the
least
clerval
said
that
if
i
could
have
put
on
the
appearance
of
nervousness
the
empress
who
is
kindness
itself
would
certainly
have
encouraged
me
i
left
her
the
next
morning
after
i
had
seen
her
copy
out
the
petition
she
wrote
a
very
good
hand
i
shall
present
it
said
she
i
wished
her
good
luck
and
arranged
to
sup
with
her
again
on
the
day
i
meant
to
part
with
zaira
all
french
girls
who
sacrifice
to
venus
are
in
the
same
style
as
the
valville
they
are
entirely
without
passion
or
love
but
they
are
pleasant
and
caressing
they
have
only
one
object
and
that
is
their
own
profit
they
make
and
unmake
an
intrigue
with
a
smiling
face
and
without
the
slightest
difficulty
it
is
their
system
and
if
it
be
not
absolutely
the
best
it
is
certainly
the
most
convenient
when
i
got
home
i
found
zaira
submissive
but
sad
which
annoyed
me
more
than
anger
would
have
done
for
i
loved
her
however
it
was
time
to
bring
the
matter
to
an
end
and
to
make
up
my
mind
to
endure
the
pain
of
parting
rinaldi
the
architect
a
man
of
seventy
but
still
vigorous
and
sensual
was
in
love
with
her
and
he
had
hinted
to
me
several
times
that
he
would
be
only
too
happy
to
take
her
over
and
to
pay
double
the
sum
i
had
given
for
her
my
answer
had
been
that
i
could
only
give
her
to
a
man
she
liked
and
that
i
meant
to
make
her
a
present
of
the
hundred
roubles
i
had
given
for
her
rinaldi
did
not
like
this
answer
as
he
had
not
very
strong
hopes
of
the
girl
taking
a
fancy
to
him
however
he
did
not
despair
he
happened
to
call
on
me
on
the
very
morning
on
which
i
had
determined
to
give
her
up
and
as
he
spoke
russian
perfectly
he
gave
zaira
to
understand
how
much
he
loved
her
her
answer
was
that
he
must
apply
to
me
as
my
will
was
law
to
her
but
that
she
neither
liked
nor
disliked
anyone
else
the
old
man
could
not
obtain
any
more
positive
reply
and
left
us
with
but
feeble
hopes
but
commending
himself
to
my
good
offices
when
he
had
gone
i
asked
zaira
whether
she
would
not
like
me
to
leave
her
to
the
worthy
man
who
would
treat
her
as
his
own
daughter
she
was
just
going
to
reply
when
i
was
handed
a
note
from
madame
valville
asking
me
to
call
on
her
as
she
had
a
piece
of
news
to
give
me
i
ordered
the
carriage
immediately
telling
zaira
that
i
should
not
be
long
very
good
she
replied
i
will
give
you
a
plain
answer
when
you
come
back
i
found
madame
valville
in
a
high
state
of
delight
long
live
the
petition
she
exclaimed
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
i
waited
for
the
empress
to
come
out
of
her
private
chapel
i
respectfully
presented
my
petition
which
she
read
as
she
walked
along
and
then
told
me
with
a
kindly
smile
to
wait
a
moment
i
waited
and
her
majesty
returned
me
the
petition
initialled
in
her
own
hand
and
bade
me
take
it
to
ghelagin
this
gentleman
gave
me
an
excellent
reception
and
told
me
that
the
sovereign
hand
ordered
him
to
give
me
my
passport
my
salary
for
a
year
and
a
hundred
ducats
for
the
journey
the
money
will
be
forwarded
in
a
fortnight
as
my
name
will
have
to
be
sent
to
the
gazette
madame
valville
was
very
grateful
and
we
fixed
the
day
of
our
departure
three
or
four
days
later
i
sent
in
my
name
to
the
gazette
i
had
promised
zaira
to
come
back
so
telling
my
new
love
that
i
would
come
and
live
with
her
as
soon
as
i
had
placed
the
young
russian
in
good
hands
i
went
home
feeling
rather
curious
to
hear
zaira
determination
after
zaira
had
supped
with
me
in
perfect
good
humour
she
asked
if
rinaldi
would
pay
me
back
the
money
i
had
given
far
her
i
said
he
would
and
she
went
on
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
worth
more
than
i
was
for
i
have
all
your
presents
and
i
know
italian
you
are
right
dear
but
i
do
want
it
to
be
said
that
i
have
made
a
profit
on
you
besides
i
intend
to
make
you
a
present
of
the
hundred
roubles
as
you
are
going
to
make
me
such
a
handsome
present
why
not
send
me
back
to
my
father
house
that
would
be
still
more
generous
if
rinaldi
really
loves
me
he
can
come
and
talk
it
over
with
my
father
you
have
no
objection
to
his
paying
me
whatever
sum
i
like
to
mention
not
at
all
on
the
contrary
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
serve
your
family
and
all
the
more
as
rinaldi
is
a
rich
man
very
good
you
will
be
always
dear
to
me
in
my
memory
you
shall
take
me
to
my
home
and
now
let
us
go
to
bed
thus
it
was
that
i
parted
with
this
charming
girl
who
made
me
live
soberly
all
the
time
i
was
at
petersburg
zinowieff
told
me
that
if
i
had
liked
to
deposit
a
small
sum
as
security
i
could
have
taken
her
with
me
but
i
had
thought
the
matter
over
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
as
zaira
grew
more
beautiful
and
charming
i
should
end
by
becoming
a
perfect
slave
to
her
possibly
however
i
should
not
have
looked
into
matters
so
closely
if
i
had
not
been
in
love
with
madame
valville
zaira
spent
the
next
morning
in
gathering
together
her
belongings
now
laughing
and
now
weeping
and
every
time
that
she
left
her
packing
to
give
me
a
kiss
i
could
not
resist
weeping
myself
when
i
restored
her
to
her
father
the
whole
family
fell
on
their
knees
around
me
alas
for
poor
human
nature
thus
it
is
degraded
by
the
iron
heel
of
oppression
zaira
looked
oddly
in
the
humble
cottage
where
one
large
mattress
served
for
the
entire
family
rinaldi
took
everything
in
good
part
he
told
me
that
since
the
daughter
would
make
no
objection
he
had
no
fear
of
the
father
doing
so
he
went
to
the
house
the
next
day
but
he
did
not
get
the
girl
till
i
had
left
petersburg
he
kept
her
for
the
remainder
of
his
days
and
behaved
very
handsomely
to
her
after
this
melancholy
separation
madame
valville
became
my
sole
mistress
and
we
left
the
russian
capital
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
i
took
an
armenian
merchant
into
my
service
he
had
lent
me
a
hundred
ducats
and
cooked
very
well
in
the
eastern
style
i
had
a
letter
from
the
polish
resident
to
prince
augustus
sulkowski
and
another
from
the
english
ambassador
for
prince
adam
czartoryski
the
day
after
we
left
petersburg
we
stopped
at
koporie
to
dine
we
had
taken
with
us
some
choice
viands
and
excellent
wines
two
days
later
we
met
the
famous
galuppi
or
buranelli
who
was
on
his
way
to
petersburg
with
two
friends
and
an
artiste
he
did
not
know
me
and
was
astonished
to
find
a
venetian
dinner
awaiting
him
at
the
inn
as
also
to
hear
a
greeting
in
his
mother
tongue
as
soon
as
i
had
pronounced
my
name
he
embraced
me
with
exclamations
of
surprise
and
joy
the
roads
were
heavy
with
rain
so
we
were
a
week
in
getting
to
riga
and
when
we
arrived
i
was
sorry
to
hear
that
prince
charles
was
not
there
from
riga
we
were
four
days
before
getting
to
konigsberg
where
madame
valville
who
was
expected
at
berlin
had
to
leave
me
i
left
her
my
armenian
to
whom
she
gladly
paid
the
hundred
ducats
i
owed
him
i
saw
her
again
two
years
later
and
shall
speak
of
the
meeting
in
due
time
we
separated
like
good
friends
without
any
sadness
we
spent
the
night
at
klein
roop
near
riga
and
she
offered
to
give
me
her
diamonds
her
jewels
and
all
that
she
possessed
we
were
staying
with
the
countess
lowenwald
to
whom
i
had
a
letter
from
the
princess
dolgorouki
this
lady
had
in
her
house
in
the
capacity
of
governess
the
pretty
english
woman
whom
i
had
known
as
campioni
wife
she
told
me
that
her
husband
was
at
warsaw
and
that
he
was
living
with
villiers
she
gave
me
a
letter
for
him
and
i
promised
to
make
him
send
her
some
money
and
i
kept
my
word
little
betty
was
as
charming
as
ever
but
her
mother
seemed
quite
jealous
of
her
and
treated
her
ill
when
i
reached
konigsberg
i
sold
my
travelling
carriage
and
took
a
place
in
a
coach
for
warsaw
we
were
four
in
all
and
my
companions
only
spoke
german
and
polish
so
that
i
had
a
dreadfully
tedious
journey
at
warsaw
i
went
to
live
with
villiers
where
i
hoped
to
meet
campioni
it
was
not
long
before
i
saw
him
and
found
him
well
in
health
and
in
comfortable
quarters
he
kept
a
dancing
school
and
had
a
good
many
pupils
he
was
delighted
to
have
news
of
fanny
and
his
children
he
sent
them
some
money
but
had
no
thoughts
of
having
them
at
warsaw
as
fanny
wished
he
assured
me
she
was
not
his
wife
he
told
me
that
tomatis
the
manager
of
the
comic
opera
had
made
a
fortune
and
had
in
his
company
a
milanese
dancer
named
catai
who
enchanted
all
the
town
by
her
charms
rather
than
her
talent
games
of
chance
were
permitted
but
he
warned
me
that
warsaw
was
full
of
a
veronese
named
giropoldi
who
lived
with
an
officer
from
lorrain
called
bachelier
held
a
bank
at
faro
at
her
house
where
a
dancer
who
had
been
the
mistress
of
the
famous
afflisio
at
vienna
brought
customers
major
sadir
whom
i
have
mentioned
before
kept
another
in
company
with
his
mistress
who
came
from
saxony
the
baron
de
heleine
was
also
in
warsaw
but
his
principal
occupation
was
to
contract
debts
which
he
did
not
mean
to
pay
he
also
lived
in
villier
house
with
his
pretty
and
virtuous
young
wife
who
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
us
campioni
told
me
of
some
other
adventurers
whose
names
i
was
very
glad
to
know
that
i
might
the
better
avoid
them
the
day
after
my
arrival
i
hired
a
man
and
a
carriage
the
latter
being
an
absolute
necessity
at
warsaw
where
in
my
time
at
all
events
it
was
impossible
to
go
on
foot
i
reached
the
capital
of
poland
at
the
end
of
october
my
first
call
was
on
prince
adam
czartoryski
lieutenant
of
podolia
for
whom
i
had
an
introduction
i
found
him
before
a
table
covered
with
papers
surrounded
by
forty
or
fifty
persons
in
an
immense
library
which
he
had
made
into
his
bedroom
he
was
married
to
a
very
pretty
woman
but
had
not
yet
had
a
child
by
her
because
she
was
too
thin
for
his
taste
he
read
the
long
letter
i
gave
him
and
said
in
elegant
french
that
he
had
a
very
high
opinion
of
the
writer
of
the
letter
but
that
as
he
was
very
busy
just
then
he
hoped
i
would
come
to
supper
with
him
if
i
had
nothing
better
to
do
i
drove
off
to
prince
sulkouski
who
had
just
been
appointed
ambassador
to
the
court
of
louis
xv
the
prince
was
the
elder
of
four
brothers
and
a
man
of
great
understanding
but
a
theorist
in
the
style
of
the
abbe
pierre
he
read
the
letter
and
said
he
wanted
to
have
a
long
talk
with
me
but
that
being
obliged
to
go
out
he
would
be
obliged
if
i
would
come
and
dine
with
him
at
four
i
accepted
the
invitation
i
then
went
to
a
merchant
named
schempinski
who
was
to
pay
me
fifty
ducats
a
month
on
papanelopulo
order
my
man
told
me
that
there
was
a
public
rehearsal
of
a
new
opera
at
the
theatre
and
i
accordingly
spent
three
hours
there
knowing
none
and
unknown
to
all
all
the
actresses
were
pretty
but
especially
the
catai
who
did
not
know
the
first
elements
of
dancing
she
was
greatly
applauded
above
all
by
prince
repnin
the
russian
ambassador
who
seemed
a
person
of
the
greatest
consequence
prince
sulkouski
kept
me
at
table
for
four
mortal
hours
talking
on
every
subject
except
those
with
which
i
happened
to
be
acquainted
his
strong
points
were
politics
and
commerce
and
as
he
found
my
mind
a
mere
void
on
these
subjects
he
shone
all
the
more
and
took
quite
a
fancy
to
me
as
i
believe
because
he
found
me
such
a
capital
listener
about
nine
having
nothing
better
to
do
a
favourite
phrase
with
the
polish
noblemen
i
went
to
prince
adam
who
after
pronouncing
my
name
introduced
me
to
the
company
there
were
present
monseigneur
krasinski
the
of
warmia
the
chief
prothonotary
rzewuski
whom
i
had
known
at
petersburg
the
palatin
oginski
general
roniker
and
two
others
whose
barbarous
names
i
have
forgotten
the
last
person
to
whom
he
introduced
me
was
his
wife
with
whom
i
was
very
pleased
a
few
moments
after
a
gentleman
came
into
the
room
and
everybody
stood
up
prince
adam
pronounced
my
name
and
turning
to
me
said
coolly
that
the
king
this
method
of
introducing
a
stranger
to
a
sovereign
prince
was
assuredly
not
an
overwhelming
one
but
it
was
nevertheless
a
surprise
and
i
found
that
an
excess
of
simplicity
may
be
as
confusing
as
the
other
extreme
at
first
i
thought
the
prince
might
be
making
a
fool
of
me
but
i
quickly
put
aside
the
idea
and
stepped
forward
and
was
about
to
kneel
but
his
majesty
gave
me
his
hand
to
kiss
with
exquisite
grace
and
as
he
was
about
to
address
me
prince
adam
shewed
him
the
letter
of
the
english
ambassador
who
was
well
known
to
the
king
the
king
read
it
still
standing
and
began
to
ask
me
questions
about
the
czarina
and
the
court
appearing
to
take
great
interest
in
my
replies
when
supper
was
announced
the
king
continued
to
talk
and
led
me
into
the
and
made
me
sit
down
at
his
right
hand
everybody
ate
heartily
except
the
king
who
appeared
to
have
no
appetite
and
myself
who
had
no
right
to
have
any
appetite
even
if
i
had
not
dined
well
with
prince
sulkouski
for
i
saw
the
whole
table
hushed
to
listen
to
my
replies
to
the
king
questions
after
supper
the
king
began
to
comment
very
graciously
on
my
answers
his
majesty
spoke
simply
but
with
great
elegance
as
he
was
leaving
he
told
me
he
should
always
be
delighted
to
see
me
at
his
court
and
prince
adam
said
that
if
i
liked
to
be
introduced
to
his
father
i
had
only
to
call
at
eleven
the
next
morning
the
king
of
poland
was
of
a
medium
height
but
well
made
his
face
was
not
a
handsome
one
but
it
was
kindly
and
intelligent
he
was
rather
and
his
features
in
repose
bore
a
somewhat
melancholy
expression
but
in
speaking
the
whole
face
seemed
to
light
up
all
he
said
was
seasoned
by
a
pleasant
wit
i
was
well
enough
pleased
with
this
interview
and
returned
to
my
inn
where
i
found
campioni
seated
amongst
several
guests
of
either
sex
and
after
staying
with
them
for
half
an
hour
i
went
to
bed
at
eleven
the
next
day
i
was
presented
to
the
great
russian
paladin
he
was
in
his
surrounded
by
his
gentlemen
in
the
national
costume
he
was
standing
up
and
conversing
with
his
followers
in
a
kindly
but
grave
manner
as
soon
as
his
son
adam
mentioned
my
name
he
unbent
and
gave
me
a
most
kindly
yet
dignified
welcome
his
manners
were
not
awful
nor
did
they
inspire
one
with
familiarity
and
i
thought
him
likely
to
be
a
good
judge
of
character
when
i
told
him
that
i
had
only
gone
to
russia
to
amuse
myself
and
see
good
company
he
immediately
concluded
that
my
aims
in
coming
to
poland
were
of
the
same
kind
and
he
told
me
that
he
could
introduce
me
to
a
large
circle
he
added
that
he
should
be
glad
to
see
me
to
dinner
and
supper
whenever
i
had
no
other
engagements
he
went
behind
a
screen
to
complete
his
toilette
and
soon
appeared
in
the
uniform
of
his
regiment
with
a
fair
peruke
in
the
style
of
the
late
king
augustus
ii
he
made
a
collective
bow
to
everyone
and
went
to
see
his
wife
who
was
recovering
from
a
disease
which
would
have
proved
fatal
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
skill
of
reimann
a
pupil
of
the
great
boerhaave
the
lady
came
of
the
now
extinct
family
of
enoff
whose
immense
wealth
she
brought
to
her
husband
when
he
married
her
he
abandoned
the
maltese
order
of
which
he
had
been
a
knight
he
won
his
bride
by
a
duel
with
pistols
on
horseback
the
lady
had
promised
that
her
hand
should
be
the
conqueror
guerdon
and
the
prince
was
so
fortunate
as
to
kill
his
rival
of
this
marriage
there
issued
prince
adam
and
a
daughter
now
a
widow
and
known
under
the
name
of
lubomirska
but
formerly
under
that
of
strasnikowa
that
being
the
title
of
the
office
her
husband
held
in
the
royal
army
it
was
this
prince
palatine
and
his
brother
the
high
chancellor
of
lithuania
who
first
brought
about
the
polish
troubles
the
two
brothers
were
discontented
with
their
position
at
the
court
where
count
bruhl
was
supreme
and
put
themselves
at
the
head
of
the
plot
for
dethroning
the
king
and
for
placing
on
the
throne
under
russian
protection
their
young
nephew
who
had
originally
gone
to
petersburg
as
an
attache
at
the
embassy
and
afterwards
succeeded
in
winning
the
favour
of
catherine
then
grand
duchess
but
soon
to
become
empress
this
young
man
was
stanislas
poniatowski
son
of
constance
czartoryski
and
the
celebrated
poniatowski
the
friend
of
charles
iii
as
luck
would
have
it
a
revolution
was
unnecessary
to
place
him
on
the
throne
for
the
king
died
in
and
gave
place
to
prince
poniatowski
who
was
chosen
king
on
the
of
september
under
the
title
of
stanislas
augustus
i
he
had
reigned
two
years
at
the
time
of
my
visit
and
i
found
warsaw
in
a
state
of
gaiety
for
a
diet
was
to
be
held
and
everyone
wished
to
know
how
it
was
that
catherine
had
given
the
poles
a
native
king
at
i
went
to
the
paladin
and
found
three
tables
at
each
of
which
there
were
places
for
thirty
and
this
was
the
usual
number
entertained
by
the
prince
the
luxury
of
the
court
paled
before
that
of
the
paladin
house
prince
adam
said
to
me
chevalier
your
place
will
always
be
at
my
father
table
this
was
a
great
honour
and
i
felt
it
the
prince
introduced
me
to
his
handsome
sister
and
to
several
palatins
and
starosts
i
did
not
fail
to
call
on
all
these
great
personages
so
in
the
course
of
a
fortnight
i
found
myself
a
welcome
guest
in
all
the
best
houses
my
purse
was
too
lean
to
allow
of
my
playing
or
consoling
myself
with
a
theatrical
beauty
so
i
fell
back
on
the
library
of
monseigneur
zalewski
the
bishop
of
kiowia
for
whom
i
had
taken
a
great
liking
i
spent
almost
all
my
mornings
with
him
and
it
was
from
this
prelate
that
i
learnt
all
the
intrigues
and
complots
by
which
the
ancient
polish
constitution
of
which
the
bishop
was
a
great
admirer
had
been
overturned
unhappily
his
firmness
was
of
no
avail
and
a
few
months
after
i
left
warsaw
the
russian
tyrants
arrested
him
and
he
was
exiled
to
siberia
i
lived
calmly
and
peaceably
and
still
look
back
upon
those
days
with
pleasure
i
spent
my
afternoons
with
the
paladin
playing
tressette
an
italian
game
of
which
he
was
very
fond
and
which
i
played
well
enough
for
the
paladin
to
like
to
have
me
as
a
partner
in
spite
of
my
sobriety
and
economy
i
found
myself
in
debt
three
months
after
my
arrival
and
i
did
not
know
where
to
turn
for
help
the
fifty
ducats
per
month
which
were
sent
me
from
venice
were
insufficient
for
the
money
i
had
to
spend
on
my
carriage
my
lodging
my
servant
and
my
dress
brought
me
down
to
the
lowest
ebb
and
i
did
not
care
to
appeal
to
anyone
but
fortune
had
a
surprise
in
store
for
me
and
hitherto
she
had
never
left
me
madame
schmit
whom
the
king
for
good
reasons
of
his
own
had
accommodated
with
apartments
in
the
palace
asked
me
one
evening
to
sup
with
her
telling
me
that
the
king
would
be
of
the
party
i
accepted
the
invitation
and
i
was
delighted
to
find
the
delightful
bishop
kraswiski
the
abbe
guigiotti
and
two
or
three
other
amateurs
of
italian
literature
the
king
whose
knowledge
of
literature
was
extensive
began
to
tell
anecdotes
of
classical
writers
quoting
manuscript
authorities
which
reduced
me
to
silence
and
which
were
possibly
invented
by
him
everyone
talked
except
myself
and
as
i
had
had
no
dinner
i
ate
like
an
ogre
only
replying
by
monosyllables
when
politeness
obliged
me
to
say
something
the
conversation
turned
on
horace
and
everyone
gave
his
opinion
on
the
great
materialist
philosophy
and
the
abbe
guigiotti
obliged
me
to
speak
by
saying
that
unless
i
agreed
with
him
i
should
not
keep
silence
if
you
take
my
silence
for
consent
to
your
extravagant
eulogium
of
horace
i
said
you
are
mistaken
for
in
my
opinion
the
cum
venari
volet
poemata
panges
of
which
you
think
so
much
is
to
my
mind
a
satire
devoid
of
delicacy
satire
and
delicacy
are
hard
to
combine
not
for
horace
who
succeeded
in
pleasing
the
great
augustus
and
rendering
him
immortal
as
the
protector
of
learned
men
indeed
other
sovereigns
seem
to
vie
with
him
by
taking
his
name
and
even
by
disguising
it
the
king
who
had
taken
the
name
of
augustus
himself
looked
grave
and
said
what
sovereigns
have
adopted
a
disguised
form
of
the
name
augustus
the
first
king
of
sweden
who
called
himself
gustavus
which
is
only
an
anagram
of
augustus
that
is
a
very
amusing
idea
and
worth
more
than
all
the
tales
we
have
told
where
did
you
find
that
in
a
manuscript
at
wolfenbuttel
the
king
laughed
loudly
though
he
himself
had
been
citing
manuscripts
but
he
returned
to
the
charge
and
said
can
you
cite
any
passage
of
horace
not
in
manuscript
where
he
shews
his
talent
for
delicacy
and
satire
sir
i
could
quote
several
passages
but
here
is
one
which
seems
to
me
very
good
rege
says
the
poet
de
paupertate
tacentes
plus
quan
pocentes
ferent
true
indeed
said
the
king
with
a
smile
madame
schmit
who
did
not
know
latin
and
inherited
curiosity
from
her
mother
and
eventually
from
eve
asked
the
bishop
what
it
meant
and
he
thus
translated
it
they
that
speak
not
of
their
necessities
in
the
presence
of
a
king
gain
more
than
they
that
are
ever
asking
the
lady
remarked
that
she
saw
nothing
satirical
in
this
after
this
it
was
my
turn
to
be
silent
again
but
the
king
began
to
talk
about
ariosto
and
expressed
a
desire
to
read
it
with
me
i
replied
with
an
inclination
of
the
head
and
horace
words
quoeram
next
morning
as
i
was
coming
out
from
mass
the
generous
and
unfortunate
stanislas
augustus
gave
me
his
hand
to
kiss
and
at
the
same
time
slid
a
roll
of
money
into
my
hand
saying
thank
no
one
but
horace
and
do
tell
anyone
about
it
the
roll
contained
two
hundred
ducats
and
i
immediately
paid
off
my
debts
since
then
i
went
almost
every
morning
to
the
king
closet
where
he
was
always
glad
to
see
his
courtiers
but
there
was
no
more
said
about
reading
ariosto
he
knew
italian
but
not
enough
to
speak
it
and
still
less
to
appreciate
the
beauties
of
the
great
poet
when
i
think
of
this
worthy
prince
and
of
the
great
qualities
he
possessed
as
a
man
i
can
not
understand
how
he
came
to
commit
so
many
errors
as
a
king
perhaps
the
least
of
them
all
was
that
he
allowed
himself
to
survive
his
country
as
he
could
not
find
a
friend
to
kill
him
i
think
he
should
have
killed
himself
but
indeed
he
had
no
need
to
ask
a
friend
to
do
him
this
service
he
should
have
imitated
the
great
kosciuszko
and
entered
into
life
eternal
by
the
sword
of
a
russian
the
carnival
was
a
brilliant
one
all
europe
seemed
to
have
assembled
at
warsaw
to
see
the
happy
being
whom
fortune
had
so
unexpectedly
raised
to
a
throne
but
after
seeing
him
all
were
agreed
that
in
his
case
at
all
events
the
deity
had
been
neither
blind
nor
foolish
perhaps
however
he
liked
shewing
himself
rather
too
much
i
have
detected
him
in
some
distress
on
his
being
informed
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
stranger
in
warsaw
who
had
not
seen
him
no
one
had
any
need
of
an
introduction
for
his
court
was
as
all
courts
should
be
open
to
everyone
and
when
he
noticed
a
strange
face
he
was
the
first
to
speak
here
i
must
set
down
an
event
which
took
place
towards
the
end
of
january
it
was
in
fact
a
dream
and
as
i
think
i
have
confessed
before
superstition
had
always
some
hold
on
me
i
dreamt
i
was
at
a
banquet
and
one
of
the
guests
threw
a
bottle
at
my
face
that
the
blood
poured
forth
that
i
ran
my
sword
through
my
body
and
jumped
into
a
carriage
and
rode
away
prince
charles
of
courland
came
to
warsaw
and
asked
me
to
dine
with
him
at
prince
poninski
the
same
that
became
so
notorious
and
was
afterwards
proscribed
and
shamefully
dishonoured
his
was
a
hospitable
house
and
he
was
surrounded
by
his
agreeable
family
i
had
never
called
on
him
as
he
was
not
a
grata
to
the
king
or
his
relations
in
the
course
of
the
dinner
a
bottle
of
champagne
burst
and
a
piece
of
broken
glass
struck
me
just
below
the
eye
it
cut
a
vein
and
the
blood
gushed
over
my
face
over
my
clothes
and
even
over
the
cloth
everybody
rose
my
wound
was
bound
up
the
cloth
was
changed
and
the
dinner
went
on
merrily
i
was
surprised
at
the
likeness
between
my
dream
and
this
incident
while
i
congratulated
myself
on
the
happy
difference
between
them
however
it
all
came
true
after
a
few
months
madame
binetti
whom
i
had
last
seen
in
london
arrived
at
warsaw
with
her
husband
and
pic
the
dancer
she
had
a
letter
of
introduction
to
the
king
brother
who
was
a
general
in
the
austrian
service
and
then
resided
at
warsaw
i
heard
that
the
day
they
came
when
i
was
at
supper
at
the
palatin
the
king
was
present
and
said
he
should
like
to
keep
them
in
warsaw
for
a
week
and
see
them
dance
if
a
thousand
ducats
could
do
it
i
went
to
see
madame
binetti
and
to
give
her
the
good
news
the
next
morning
she
was
very
much
surprised
to
meet
me
in
warsaw
and
still
more
so
at
the
news
i
gave
her
she
called
pic
who
seemed
undecided
but
as
we
were
talking
it
over
prince
poniatowski
came
in
to
acquaint
them
with
his
majesty
wishes
and
the
offer
was
accepted
in
three
days
pic
arranged
a
ballet
the
costumes
the
scenery
the
music
the
dancers
all
were
ready
and
tomatis
put
it
on
handsomely
to
please
his
generous
master
the
couple
gave
such
satisfaction
that
they
were
engaged
for
a
year
the
catai
was
furious
as
madame
binetti
threw
her
completely
into
the
shade
and
worse
still
drew
away
her
lovers
tomatis
who
was
under
the
catai
influence
made
things
so
unpleasant
for
madame
binetti
that
the
two
dancers
became
deadly
enemies
in
ten
or
twelve
days
madame
binetti
was
settled
it
a
house
her
plate
was
simple
but
good
her
cellar
full
of
excellent
wine
her
cook
an
artist
and
her
adorers
numerous
amongst
them
being
moszciuski
and
branicki
the
king
friends
the
pit
was
divided
into
two
parties
for
the
catai
was
resolved
to
make
a
stand
against
the
new
comer
though
her
talents
were
not
to
be
compared
to
madame
binetti
she
danced
in
the
first
ballet
and
her
rival
in
the
second
those
who
applauded
the
first
greeted
that
second
in
dead
silence
and
vice
versa
i
had
great
obligations
towards
madame
binetti
but
my
duty
also
drew
me
towards
the
catai
who
numbered
in
her
party
all
the
czartoryskis
and
their
following
prince
lubomirski
and
other
powerful
nobles
it
was
plain
that
i
could
not
desert
to
madame
binetti
without
earning
the
contempt
of
the
other
party
madame
binetti
reproached
me
bitterly
and
i
laid
the
case
plainly
before
her
she
agreed
that
i
could
not
do
otherwise
but
begged
me
to
stay
away
from
the
theatre
in
future
telling
me
that
she
had
got
a
rod
in
pickle
for
tomatis
which
would
make
him
repent
of
his
impertinence
she
called
me
her
oldest
friend
and
indeed
i
was
very
fond
of
her
and
cared
nothing
for
the
catai
despite
her
prettiness
xavier
branicki
the
royal
postoli
knight
of
the
white
eagle
colonel
of
uhlans
the
king
friend
was
the
chief
adorer
of
madame
binetti
the
lady
probably
confided
her
displeasure
to
him
and
begged
him
to
take
vengeance
on
the
manager
who
had
committed
so
many
offences
against
her
count
branicki
in
his
turn
probably
promised
to
avenge
her
quarrel
and
if
no
opportunity
of
doing
so
arose
to
create
an
opportunity
at
least
this
is
the
way
in
which
affairs
of
this
kind
are
usually
managed
and
i
can
find
no
better
explanation
for
what
happened
nevertheless
the
way
in
which
the
pole
took
vengeance
was
very
original
and
extraordinary
on
the
of
february
branicki
went
to
the
opera
and
contrary
to
his
custom
went
to
the
catai
and
began
to
pay
his
court
to
the
actress
tomatis
being
present
both
he
and
the
actress
concluded
that
branicki
had
had
a
quarrel
with
her
rival
and
though
she
did
not
much
care
to
place
him
in
the
number
of
her
adorers
she
yet
gave
him
a
good
reception
for
she
knew
it
would
be
dangerous
to
despise
his
suit
openly
when
the
catai
had
completed
her
toilet
the
gallant
postoli
offered
her
his
arm
to
take
her
to
her
carriage
which
was
at
the
door
tomatis
followed
and
i
too
was
there
awaiting
my
carriage
madame
catai
came
down
the
was
opened
she
stepped
in
and
branicki
got
in
after
her
telling
the
astonished
tomatis
to
follow
them
in
the
other
carriage
tomatis
replied
that
he
meant
to
ride
in
his
own
carriage
and
begged
the
colonel
to
get
out
branicki
paid
no
attention
and
told
the
coachman
to
drive
on
tornatis
forbade
him
to
stir
and
the
man
of
course
obeyed
his
master
the
gallant
postcili
was
therefore
obliged
to
get
down
but
he
bade
his
hussar
give
tomatis
a
box
on
the
ear
and
this
order
was
so
promptly
and
vigorously
obeyed
that
the
unfortunate
man
was
on
the
ground
before
he
had
time
to
recollect
that
he
had
a
sword
he
got
up
eventually
and
drove
off
but
he
could
eat
no
supper
no
doubt
because
he
had
a
blow
to
digest
i
was
to
have
supped
with
him
but
after
this
scene
i
had
really
not
the
face
to
go
i
went
home
in
a
melancholy
and
reflective
mood
wondering
whether
the
whole
had
been
concerted
but
i
concluded
that
this
was
impossible
as
neither
branicki
nor
binetti
could
have
foreseen
the
impoliteness
and
cowardice
of
tomatis
in
the
next
chapter
the
reader
will
see
how
tragically
the
matter
ended
chapter
xxii
my
duel
with
branicki
my
journey
to
leopol
and
return
to
warsaw
i
receive
the
order
to
leave
my
departure
with
the
unknown
one
on
reflection
i
concluded
that
branicki
had
not
done
an
ungentlemanly
thing
in
getting
into
tomatis
carriage
he
had
merely
behaved
with
impetuosity
as
if
he
were
the
catai
lover
it
also
appeared
to
me
that
considering
the
affront
he
had
received
from
the
jealous
italian
the
box
on
the
ear
was
a
very
moderate
form
of
vengeance
a
blow
is
bad
of
course
but
not
so
bad
as
death
and
branicki
might
very
well
have
run
his
sword
through
the
manager
body
certainly
if
branicki
had
killed
him
he
would
have
been
stigmatised
as
an
assassin
for
though
tomatis
had
a
sword
the
polish
officer
servants
would
never
have
allowed
him
to
draw
it
nevertheless
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
tomatis
should
have
tried
to
take
the
servant
life
even
at
the
risk
of
his
own
he
wanted
no
more
courage
for
that
than
in
ordering
the
king
favourite
to
come
out
of
the
carriage
he
might
have
foreseen
that
the
polish
noble
would
be
stung
to
the
quick
and
would
surely
attempt
to
take
speedy
vengeance
the
next
day
the
encounter
was
the
subject
of
all
conversations
tomatis
remained
indoors
for
a
week
calling
for
vengeance
in
vain
the
king
told
him
he
could
do
nothing
for
him
as
branicki
maintained
he
had
only
given
insult
for
insult
i
saw
tomatis
who
told
me
in
confidence
that
he
could
easily
take
vengeance
but
that
it
would
cost
him
too
dear
he
had
spent
forty
thousand
ducats
on
the
two
ballets
and
if
he
had
avenged
himself
he
would
have
lost
it
nearly
all
as
he
would
be
obliged
to
leave
the
kingdom
the
only
consolation
he
had
was
that
his
great
friends
were
kinder
to
him
than
ever
and
the
king
himself
honoured
him
with
peculiar
attention
madame
binetti
was
triumphant
when
i
saw
her
she
condoled
with
me
ironically
on
the
mishap
that
had
befallen
my
friend
she
wearied
me
but
i
could
not
guess
that
branicki
had
only
acted
at
her
instigation
and
still
less
that
she
had
a
grudge
against
me
indeed
if
i
had
known
it
i
should
only
have
laughed
at
her
for
i
had
nothing
to
dread
from
her
bravo
dagger
i
had
never
seen
him
nor
spoken
to
him
he
could
have
no
opportunity
for
attacking
me
he
was
never
with
the
king
in
the
morning
and
never
went
to
the
palatin
to
supper
being
an
unpopular
character
with
the
polish
nobility
this
branicki
was
said
to
have
been
originally
a
cossack
branecki
by
name
he
became
the
king
favorite
and
assumed
the
name
of
branicki
pretending
to
be
of
the
same
family
as
the
illustrious
marshal
of
that
name
who
was
still
alive
but
he
far
from
recognizing
the
pretender
ordered
his
shield
to
be
broken
up
and
buried
with
him
as
the
last
of
the
race
however
that
may
be
branicki
was
the
tool
of
the
russian
party
the
determined
enemy
of
those
who
withstood
catherine
design
of
russianising
the
ancient
polish
constitution
the
king
liked
him
out
of
habit
and
because
he
had
peculiar
obligations
to
him
the
life
i
lived
was
really
exemplary
i
indulged
neither
in
love
affairs
nor
gaming
i
worked
for
the
king
hoping
to
become
his
secretary
i
paid
my
court
to
the
who
liked
my
company
and
i
played
tressette
with
the
palatin
himself
on
the
of
march
casimir
eve
there
was
a
banquet
at
court
to
which
i
had
the
honour
to
be
invited
casimir
was
the
name
of
the
eldest
brother
who
held
the
office
of
grand
chamberlain
after
dinner
the
king
asked
me
if
i
intended
going
to
the
theatre
where
a
polish
play
was
to
be
given
for
the
first
time
everybody
was
interested
in
this
novelty
but
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
as
i
did
not
understand
the
language
and
i
told
the
king
as
much
never
mind
said
he
come
in
my
box
this
was
too
flattering
an
invitation
to
be
refused
so
i
obeyed
the
royal
command
and
stood
behind
the
king
chair
after
the
second
act
a
ballet
was
given
and
the
dancing
of
madame
caracci
a
piedmontese
so
pleased
his
majesty
that
he
went
to
the
unusual
pains
of
clapping
her
i
only
knew
the
dancer
by
sight
for
i
had
never
spoken
to
her
she
had
some
talents
her
principal
admirer
was
count
poninski
who
was
always
reproaching
me
when
i
dined
with
him
for
visiting
the
other
dancers
to
the
exclusion
of
madame
caracci
i
thought
of
his
reproach
at
the
time
and
determined
to
pay
her
a
visit
after
the
ballet
to
congratulate
her
on
her
performance
and
the
king
applause
on
my
way
i
passed
by
madame
binetti
and
seeing
the
door
open
i
stayed
a
moment
count
branicki
came
up
and
i
left
with
a
bow
and
passed
on
to
madame
caracci
she
was
astonished
to
see
me
and
began
with
kindly
reproaches
for
my
neglect
to
which
i
replied
with
compliments
and
then
giving
her
a
kiss
i
promised
to
come
and
see
her
just
as
i
embraced
her
who
should
enter
but
branicki
whom
i
had
left
a
moment
before
with
madame
binetti
he
had
clearly
followed
me
in
the
hopes
of
picking
a
quarrel
he
was
accompanied
by
bininski
his
as
soon
as
he
appeared
politeness
made
me
stand
up
and
turn
to
go
but
he
stopped
me
it
seems
to
me
i
have
come
at
a
bad
time
it
looks
as
if
you
loved
this
lady
certainly
my
lord
does
not
your
excellency
consider
her
as
worthy
of
love
quite
so
but
as
it
happens
i
love
her
too
and
i
am
not
the
man
to
bear
any
rivals
as
i
know
that
i
shall
love
her
no
more
then
you
give
her
up
with
all
my
heart
for
everyone
must
yield
to
such
a
noble
as
you
are
very
good
but
i
call
a
man
that
yields
a
coward
is
that
rather
a
strong
expression
as
i
uttered
these
words
i
looked
proudly
at
him
and
touched
the
hilt
of
my
sword
three
or
four
officers
were
present
and
witnessed
what
passed
i
had
hardly
gone
four
paces
from
the
when
i
heard
myself
called
venetian
coward
in
spite
of
my
rage
i
restrained
myself
and
turned
back
saying
coolly
and
firmly
that
perhaps
a
venetian
coward
might
kill
a
brave
pole
outside
the
theatre
and
without
awaiting
a
reply
i
left
the
building
by
the
chief
staircase
i
waited
vainly
outside
the
theatre
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
my
sword
in
my
hand
for
i
was
not
afraid
of
losing
forty
thousand
ducats
like
tomatis
at
last
half
perishing
with
cold
i
called
my
carriage
and
drove
to
the
palatin
where
the
king
was
to
sup
the
cold
and
loneliness
began
to
cool
my
brain
and
i
congratulated
myself
on
my
in
not
drawing
my
sword
in
the
and
i
felt
glad
that
branicki
had
not
followed
me
down
the
stairs
for
his
friend
bininski
had
a
sabre
and
i
should
probably
have
been
assassinated
although
the
poles
are
polite
enough
there
is
still
a
good
deal
of
the
old
leaven
in
them
they
are
still
dacians
and
samaritans
at
dinner
in
war
and
in
friendship
as
they
call
it
but
which
is
often
a
burden
hardly
to
be
borne
they
can
never
understand
that
a
man
may
be
sufficient
company
for
himself
and
that
it
is
not
right
to
descend
on
him
in
a
troop
and
ask
him
to
give
them
dinner
i
made
up
my
mind
that
madame
binetti
had
excited
branicki
to
follow
me
and
possibly
to
treat
me
as
he
had
treated
tomatis
i
had
not
received
a
blow
certainly
but
i
had
been
called
a
coward
i
had
no
choice
but
to
demand
satisfaction
but
i
also
determined
to
be
studiously
moderate
throughout
in
this
frame
of
mind
i
got
down
at
the
palatin
resolved
to
tell
the
whole
story
to
the
king
leaving
to
his
majesty
the
task
of
compelling
his
favourite
to
give
me
satisfaction
as
soon
as
the
palatin
saw
me
he
reproached
me
in
a
friendly
manner
for
keeping
him
waiting
and
we
sat
down
to
tressette
i
was
his
partner
and
committed
several
blunders
when
it
came
to
losing
a
second
game
he
said
where
is
your
head
my
lord
it
is
four
leagues
away
a
respectable
man
ought
to
have
his
head
in
the
game
and
not
at
a
distance
of
four
leagues
with
these
words
the
prince
threw
down
his
cards
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
i
was
rather
startled
but
i
got
up
and
stood
by
the
fire
waiting
for
the
king
but
after
i
had
waited
thus
for
half
an
hour
a
chamberlain
came
from
the
palace
and
announced
that
his
majesty
could
not
do
himself
the
honour
of
supping
with
my
lord
that
night
this
was
a
blow
for
me
but
i
concealed
my
disappointment
supper
was
served
and
i
sat
down
as
usual
at
the
left
hand
of
the
palatin
who
was
annoyed
with
me
and
chewed
it
we
were
eighteen
at
table
and
for
once
i
had
no
appetite
about
the
middle
of
the
supper
prince
gaspard
lubomirski
came
in
and
chanced
to
sit
down
opposite
me
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
condoled
with
me
in
a
loud
voice
for
what
had
happened
i
am
sorry
for
you
said
he
but
branicki
was
drunk
and
you
really
should
count
what
he
said
as
an
insult
what
has
happened
became
at
once
the
general
question
i
held
my
tongue
and
when
they
asked
lubomirski
he
replied
that
as
i
kept
silence
it
was
his
duty
to
do
the
same
thereupon
the
palatin
speaking
in
his
friendliest
manner
said
to
me
what
has
taken
place
between
you
and
branicki
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
story
my
lord
in
private
after
supper
the
conversation
became
indifferent
and
after
the
meal
was
over
the
palatin
took
up
his
stand
by
the
small
door
by
which
he
was
accustomed
to
leave
the
room
and
there
i
told
him
the
whole
story
he
sighed
condoled
with
me
and
added
you
had
good
reasons
for
being
at
cards
may
i
presume
to
ask
your
excellency
advice
i
never
give
advice
in
these
affairs
in
which
you
must
do
or
nothing
the
palatin
shook
me
by
the
hand
and
i
went
home
and
slept
for
six
hours
as
soon
as
i
awoke
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
my
first
thought
was
everything
or
nothing
i
soon
rejected
the
latter
alternative
and
i
saw
that
i
must
demand
a
duel
to
the
death
if
branicki
refused
to
fight
i
should
be
compelled
to
kill
him
even
if
i
were
to
lose
my
head
for
it
such
was
my
determination
to
write
to
him
proposing
a
duel
at
four
leagues
from
warsaw
this
being
the
limit
of
the
starostia
in
which
duelling
was
forbidden
on
pain
of
death
i
wrote
as
follows
for
i
have
kept
the
rough
draft
of
the
letter
to
this
day
warsaw
march
my
lord
yesterday
evening
your
excellency
insulted
me
with
a
light
heart
without
my
having
given
you
any
cause
or
reason
for
doing
so
this
seems
to
indicate
that
you
hate
me
and
would
gladly
efface
me
from
the
land
of
the
living
i
both
can
and
will
oblige
you
in
this
matter
be
kind
enough
therefore
to
drive
me
in
your
carriage
to
a
place
where
my
death
will
not
subject
your
lordship
to
the
vengeance
of
the
law
in
case
you
obtain
the
victory
and
where
i
shall
enjoy
the
same
advantage
if
god
give
me
grace
to
kill
your
lordship
i
should
not
make
this
proposal
unless
i
believe
your
lordship
to
be
of
a
noble
disposition
i
have
the
honour
to
be
etc
i
sent
this
letter
an
hour
before
to
branicki
lodging
in
the
palace
my
messenger
had
orders
to
give
the
letter
into
the
count
own
hands
to
wait
for
him
to
rise
and
also
for
an
answer
in
half
an
hour
i
received
the
following
answer
sir
i
accept
your
proposal
and
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
inform
me
when
i
shall
have
the
honour
of
seeing
you
i
remain
sir
etc
i
answered
this
immediately
informing
him
i
would
call
on
him
the
next
day
at
six
in
the
morning
shortly
after
i
received
a
second
letter
in
which
he
said
that
i
might
choose
the
arms
and
place
but
that
our
differences
must
be
settled
in
the
course
of
the
day
i
sent
him
the
measure
of
my
sword
which
was
inches
long
telling
him
he
might
choose
any
place
beyond
the
ban
in
reply
i
had
the
following
sir
you
will
greatly
oblige
me
by
coming
now
i
have
sent
my
carriage
i
have
the
honour
to
be
etc
i
replied
that
i
had
business
all
the
day
and
that
as
i
had
made
up
my
mind
not
to
call
upon
him
except
for
the
purpose
of
fighting
i
begged
him
not
to
be
offended
if
i
took
the
liberty
of
sending
back
his
carriage
an
hour
later
branicki
called
in
person
leaving
his
suite
at
the
door
he
came
into
the
room
requested
some
gentlemen
who
were
talking
with
me
to
leave
us
alone
locked
the
door
after
them
and
then
sat
down
on
my
bed
i
did
not
understand
what
all
this
meant
so
i
took
up
my
pistols
do
be
afraid
said
he
i
am
not
come
to
assassinate
you
but
merely
to
say
that
i
accept
your
proposal
on
condition
only
that
the
duel
shall
take
place
if
not
never
it
is
out
of
the
question
i
have
letters
to
write
and
some
business
to
do
for
the
king
that
will
do
afterwards
in
all
probability
you
will
not
fall
and
if
you
do
i
am
sure
the
king
will
forgive
you
besides
a
dead
man
need
fear
no
reproaches
i
want
to
make
my
will
come
come
you
need
be
afraid
of
dying
it
will
be
time
enough
for
you
to
make
your
will
in
fifty
years
but
why
should
your
excellency
not
wait
till
tomorrow
i
do
want
to
be
caught
you
have
nothing
of
the
kind
to
fear
from
me
i
daresay
but
unless
we
make
haste
the
king
will
have
us
both
arrested
how
can
he
unless
you
have
told
him
about
our
quarrel
ah
you
do
understand
well
i
am
quite
willing
to
give
you
satisfaction
but
it
must
be
or
never
very
good
this
duel
is
too
dear
to
my
heart
for
me
to
leave
you
any
pretext
for
avoiding
it
call
for
me
after
dinner
for
i
shall
want
all
my
strength
certainly
for
my
part
i
like
a
good
supper
after
better
than
a
good
dinner
before
everyone
to
his
taste
true
by
the
way
why
did
you
send
me
the
length
of
your
sword
i
intend
to
fight
with
pistols
for
i
never
use
swords
with
unknown
persons
what
do
you
mean
i
beg
of
you
to
refrain
from
insulting
me
in
my
own
house
i
do
not
intend
to
fight
with
pistols
and
you
can
not
compel
me
to
do
so
for
i
have
your
letter
giving
me
the
choice
of
weapons
strictly
speaking
no
doubt
you
are
in
the
right
but
i
am
sure
you
are
too
polite
not
to
give
way
when
i
assure
you
that
you
will
lay
me
under
a
great
obligation
by
doing
so
very
often
the
first
shot
is
a
miss
and
if
that
is
the
case
with
both
of
us
i
promise
to
fight
with
swords
as
long
as
you
like
will
you
oblige
me
in
the
matter
yes
for
i
like
your
way
of
asking
though
in
my
opinion
a
pistol
duel
is
a
barbarous
affair
i
accept
but
on
the
following
conditions
you
must
bring
two
pistols
charge
them
in
my
presence
and
give
me
the
choice
if
the
first
shot
is
a
miss
we
will
fight
with
swords
till
the
first
blood
or
to
the
death
whichever
you
prefer
call
for
me
at
three
and
choose
some
place
where
we
shall
be
secure
from
the
law
very
good
you
are
a
good
fellow
allow
me
to
embrace
you
give
me
your
word
of
honour
not
to
say
a
word
about
it
to
anyone
for
if
you
did
we
should
be
arrested
immediately
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
my
talking
the
project
is
too
dear
to
me
good
farewell
till
three
as
soon
as
the
brave
braggart
had
left
me
i
placed
the
papers
i
was
doing
for
the
king
apart
and
went
to
campioni
in
whom
i
had
great
confidence
take
this
packet
to
the
king
i
said
if
i
happen
to
be
killed
you
may
guess
perhaps
what
is
going
to
happen
but
do
not
say
a
word
to
anyone
or
you
will
have
me
for
your
bitterest
enemy
as
it
would
mean
loss
of
honour
to
me
i
understand
you
may
reckon
on
my
discretion
and
i
hope
the
affair
may
be
ended
honourably
and
prosperously
for
you
but
take
a
piece
of
friendly
advice
do
spare
your
opponent
were
it
the
king
himself
for
it
might
cost
you
your
life
i
know
that
by
experience
i
will
not
forget
farewell
we
kissed
each
other
and
i
ordered
an
excellent
dinner
for
i
had
no
mind
to
be
sent
to
pluto
fasting
campioni
came
in
to
dinner
at
one
and
at
dessert
i
had
a
visit
from
two
young
counts
with
their
tutor
bertrand
a
kindly
swiss
they
were
witnesses
to
my
cheerfulness
and
the
excellent
appetite
with
which
i
ate
at
two
i
dismissed
my
company
and
stood
at
the
window
to
be
ready
to
go
down
directly
branicki
carriage
appeared
he
drove
up
in
a
travelling
carriage
and
six
two
grooms
leading
went
in
front
followed
by
his
two
and
two
hussars
behind
his
carriage
stood
four
servants
i
hastened
to
descend
and
found
my
enemy
was
accompanied
by
a
and
an
armed
footman
the
door
was
opened
the
general
gave
me
his
place
and
i
ordered
my
servants
not
to
follow
me
but
to
await
my
orders
at
the
house
you
might
want
them
said
branicki
they
had
better
come
along
if
i
had
as
many
as
you
i
would
certainly
agree
to
your
proposition
but
as
it
is
i
shall
do
still
better
without
any
at
all
if
need
be
your
excellency
will
see
that
i
am
tended
by
your
own
servants
he
gave
me
his
hand
and
assured
me
they
should
wait
on
me
before
himself
i
sat
down
and
we
went
off
it
would
have
been
absurd
if
i
had
asked
where
we
were
going
so
i
held
my
tongue
for
at
such
moments
a
man
should
take
heed
to
his
words
branicki
was
silent
and
i
thought
the
best
thing
i
could
do
would
be
to
engage
him
in
a
trivial
conversation
does
your
excellency
intend
spending
the
spring
at
warsaw
i
had
thought
of
doing
so
but
you
may
possibly
send
me
to
pass
the
spring
somewhere
else
oh
i
hope
not
have
you
seen
any
military
service
yes
but
may
i
ask
why
your
excellency
asks
me
the
question
for
i
had
no
particular
reason
it
was
only
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
we
had
driven
about
half
an
hour
when
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
door
of
a
large
garden
we
got
down
and
following
the
postoli
reached
a
green
arbour
which
by
the
way
was
not
at
all
green
on
that
of
march
in
it
was
a
stone
table
on
which
the
footman
placed
two
pistols
a
foot
and
half
long
with
a
powder
flask
and
scales
he
weighed
the
powder
loaded
them
equally
and
laid
them
down
crosswise
on
the
table
this
done
branicki
said
boldly
choose
your
weapon
sir
at
this
the
general
called
out
is
this
a
duel
sir
yes
you
can
not
fight
here
you
are
within
the
ban
no
matter
it
does
matter
and
i
at
all
events
refuse
to
be
a
witness
i
am
on
guard
at
the
castle
and
you
have
taken
me
by
surprise
be
quiet
i
will
answer
for
everything
i
owe
this
gentleman
satisfaction
and
i
mean
to
give
it
him
here
casanova
said
the
general
you
can
not
fight
here
then
why
have
i
been
brought
here
i
shall
defend
myself
wherever
i
am
attacked
lay
the
whole
matter
before
the
king
and
you
shall
have
my
voice
in
your
favour
i
am
quite
willing
to
do
so
general
if
his
excellency
will
say
that
he
regrets
what
passed
between
us
last
night
branicki
looked
fiercely
at
me
and
said
wrathfully
that
he
had
come
to
fight
and
not
to
parley
general
said
i
you
can
bear
witness
that
i
have
done
all
in
my
power
to
avoid
this
duel
the
general
went
away
with
his
head
between
his
hands
and
throwing
off
my
cloak
i
took
the
first
pistol
that
came
to
my
hand
branicki
took
the
other
and
said
that
he
would
guarantee
upon
his
honour
that
my
weapon
was
a
good
one
i
am
going
to
try
its
goodness
on
your
head
i
answered
he
turned
pale
at
this
threw
his
sword
to
one
of
his
servants
and
bared
his
throat
and
i
was
obliged
to
my
sorrow
to
follow
his
example
for
my
sword
was
the
only
weapon
i
had
with
the
exception
of
the
pistol
i
bared
my
chest
also
and
stepped
back
five
or
six
paces
and
he
did
the
same
as
soon
as
we
had
taken
up
our
positions
i
took
off
my
hat
with
my
left
hand
and
begged
him
to
fire
first
instead
of
doing
so
immediately
he
lost
two
or
three
seconds
in
sighting
aiming
and
covering
his
head
by
raising
the
weapon
before
it
i
was
not
in
a
position
to
let
him
kill
me
at
his
ease
so
i
suddenly
aimed
and
fired
on
him
just
as
he
fired
on
me
that
i
did
so
is
evident
as
all
the
witnesses
were
unanimous
in
saying
that
they
only
heard
one
report
i
felt
i
was
wounded
in
my
left
hand
and
so
put
it
into
my
pocket
and
i
ran
towards
my
enemy
who
had
fallen
all
of
a
sudden
as
i
knelt
beside
him
three
bare
swords
were
flourished
over
my
head
and
three
noble
assassins
prepared
to
cut
me
down
beside
their
master
fortunately
branicki
had
not
lost
consciousness
or
the
power
of
speaking
and
he
cried
out
in
a
voice
of
thunder
scoundrels
have
some
respect
for
a
man
of
honour
this
seemed
to
petrify
them
i
put
my
right
hand
under
the
armpit
while
the
general
helped
him
on
the
other
side
and
thus
we
took
him
to
the
inn
which
happened
to
be
near
at
hand
branicki
stooped
as
he
walked
and
gazed
at
me
curiously
apparently
wondering
where
all
the
blood
on
my
clothes
came
from
when
we
got
to
the
inn
branicki
laid
himself
down
in
an
we
unbuttoned
his
clothes
and
lifted
up
his
shirt
and
he
could
see
himself
that
he
was
dangerously
wounded
my
ball
had
entered
his
body
by
the
seventh
rib
on
the
right
hand
and
had
gone
out
by
the
second
false
rib
on
the
left
the
two
wounds
were
ten
inches
apart
and
the
case
was
of
an
alarming
nature
as
the
intestines
must
have
been
pierced
branicki
spoke
to
me
in
a
weak
voice
you
have
killed
me
so
make
haste
away
as
you
are
in
danger
of
the
gibbet
the
duel
was
fought
in
the
ban
and
i
am
a
high
court
officer
and
a
knight
of
the
white
eagle
so
lose
no
time
and
if
you
have
not
enough
money
take
my
purse
i
picked
up
the
purse
which
had
fallen
out
and
put
it
back
in
his
pocket
thanking
him
and
saying
it
would
be
useless
to
me
for
if
i
were
guilty
i
was
content
to
lose
my
head
i
hope
i
added
that
your
wound
will
not
be
mortal
and
i
am
deeply
grieved
at
your
obliging
me
to
fight
with
these
words
i
kissed
him
on
his
brow
and
left
the
inn
seeing
neither
horses
nor
carriage
nor
servant
they
had
all
gone
off
for
doctor
surgeon
priest
and
the
friends
and
relatives
of
the
wounded
man
i
was
alone
and
without
any
weapon
in
the
midst
of
a
country
my
hand
was
wounded
and
i
had
not
the
slightest
idea
which
was
the
way
to
warsaw
i
took
the
road
which
seemed
most
likely
and
after
i
had
gone
some
distance
i
met
a
peasant
with
an
empty
sleigh
warszawa
i
cried
shewing
him
a
ducat
he
understood
me
and
lifted
a
coarse
mat
with
which
he
covered
me
when
i
got
into
the
sleigh
and
then
set
off
at
a
gallop
all
at
once
biniski
branicki
came
galloping
furiously
along
the
road
with
his
bare
sword
in
his
hand
he
was
evidently
running
after
me
happily
he
did
not
glance
at
the
wretched
sleigh
in
which
i
was
or
else
he
would
undoubtedly
have
murdered
me
i
got
at
last
to
warsaw
and
went
to
the
house
of
prince
adam
czartoryski
to
beg
him
to
shelter
me
but
there
was
nobody
there
without
delay
i
determined
to
seek
refuge
in
the
convent
of
the
recollets
which
was
handy
i
rang
at
the
door
of
the
monastery
and
the
porter
seeing
me
covered
with
blood
hastened
to
shut
the
door
guessing
the
object
of
my
visit
but
i
did
not
give
him
the
time
to
do
so
but
honouring
him
with
a
hearty
kick
forced
my
way
in
his
cries
attracted
a
troop
of
frightened
monks
i
demanded
sanctuary
and
threatened
them
with
vengeance
if
they
refused
to
grant
it
one
of
their
number
spoke
to
me
and
i
was
taken
to
a
little
den
which
looked
more
like
a
dungeon
than
anything
else
i
offered
no
resistance
feeling
sure
that
they
would
change
their
tune
before
very
long
i
asked
them
to
send
for
my
servants
and
when
they
came
i
sent
for
a
doctor
and
campioni
before
the
surgeon
could
come
the
palatin
of
polduchia
was
announced
i
had
never
had
the
honour
of
speaking
to
him
but
after
hearing
the
history
of
my
duel
he
was
so
kind
as
to
give
me
all
the
particulars
of
a
duel
he
had
fought
in
his
youthful
days
soon
after
came
the
palatin
of
kalisch
prince
jablenowski
prince
sanguska
and
the
palatin
of
wilna
who
all
joined
in
a
chorus
of
abuse
of
the
monks
who
had
lodged
me
so
scurvily
the
poor
religious
excused
themselves
by
saying
that
i
had
their
porter
which
made
my
noble
friends
laugh
but
i
did
not
laugh
for
my
wound
was
very
painful
however
i
was
immediately
moved
into
two
of
their
best
the
ball
had
pierced
my
hand
by
the
metacarpus
under
the
index
finger
and
had
broken
the
first
phalanges
its
force
had
been
arrested
by
a
metal
button
on
my
waistcoat
and
it
had
only
inflicted
a
slight
wound
on
my
stomach
close
to
the
navel
however
there
it
was
and
it
had
to
be
extracted
for
it
pained
me
extremely
an
empiric
named
gendron
the
first
surgeon
my
servants
had
found
made
an
opening
on
the
opposite
side
of
my
hand
which
doubled
the
wound
while
he
was
performing
this
painful
operation
i
told
the
story
of
the
duel
to
the
company
concealing
the
anguish
i
was
enduring
what
a
power
vanity
exercises
on
the
moral
and
physical
forces
if
i
had
been
alone
i
should
probably
have
fainted
as
soon
as
the
empiric
gendron
was
gone
the
palatin
surgeon
came
in
and
took
charge
of
the
case
calling
gendron
a
low
fellow
at
the
same
time
prince
lubomirski
the
husband
of
the
palatin
daughter
arrived
and
gave
us
all
a
surprise
by
recounting
the
strange
occurrences
which
had
happened
after
the
duel
bininski
came
to
where
branicki
was
lying
and
seeing
his
wound
rode
off
furiously
on
horseback
swearing
to
strike
me
dead
wherever
he
found
me
he
fancied
i
would
be
with
tomatis
and
went
to
his
house
he
found
tomatis
with
his
mistress
prince
lubomirski
and
count
moszczinski
but
no
casanova
was
visible
he
asked
where
i
was
and
on
tomatis
replying
that
he
did
not
know
he
discharged
a
pistol
at
his
head
at
this
dastardly
action
count
moszczincki
seized
him
and
tried
to
throw
him
out
of
the
window
but
the
madman
got
loose
with
three
cuts
of
his
sabre
one
of
which
slashed
the
count
on
the
face
and
knocked
out
three
of
his
teeth
after
this
exploit
prince
lubomirski
continued
he
seized
me
by
the
throat
and
held
a
pistol
to
my
head
threatening
to
blow
out
my
brains
if
i
did
not
take
him
in
safety
to
the
court
where
his
horse
was
so
that
he
might
get
away
from
the
house
without
any
attack
being
made
on
him
by
tomatis
servants
and
i
did
so
immediately
moszczinski
is
in
the
doctor
hands
and
will
be
laid
up
for
some
time
as
soon
as
it
was
reported
that
branicki
was
killed
his
uhlans
began
to
ride
about
the
town
swearing
to
avenge
their
colonel
and
to
slaughter
you
it
is
very
fortunate
that
you
took
refuge
here
the
chief
marshal
has
had
the
monastery
surrounded
by
two
hundred
dragoons
ostensibly
to
prevent
your
escape
but
in
reality
to
defend
you
from
branicki
soldiers
the
doctors
say
that
the
postoli
is
in
great
danger
if
the
ball
has
wounded
the
intestines
but
if
not
they
answer
for
his
recovery
his
fate
will
be
known
tomorrow
he
now
lies
at
the
lord
chamberlain
not
daring
to
have
himself
carried
to
his
apartments
at
the
palace
the
king
has
been
to
see
him
and
the
general
who
was
present
told
his
majesty
that
the
only
thing
that
saved
your
life
was
your
threat
to
aim
at
head
this
frightened
him
and
to
keep
your
ball
from
his
head
he
stood
in
such
an
awkward
position
that
he
missed
your
vital
parts
otherwise
he
would
undoubtedly
have
shot
you
through
the
heart
for
he
can
split
a
bullet
into
two
halves
by
firing
against
the
blade
of
a
knife
it
was
also
a
lucky
thing
for
you
that
you
escaped
bininski
who
never
thought
of
looking
for
you
in
the
wretched
sleigh
my
lord
the
most
fortunate
thing
for
me
is
that
i
did
not
kill
my
man
outright
otherwise
i
should
have
been
cut
to
pieces
just
as
i
went
to
his
help
by
three
of
his
servants
who
stood
over
me
with
drawn
swords
however
the
postoli
ordered
them
to
leave
me
alone
i
am
sorry
for
what
has
happened
to
your
highness
and
count
moszczinski
and
if
tomatis
was
not
killed
by
the
madman
it
is
only
because
the
pistol
was
only
charged
with
powder
that
what
i
think
for
no
one
heard
the
bullet
but
it
was
a
mere
chance
quite
so
just
then
an
officer
of
the
palatin
came
to
me
with
a
note
from
his
master
which
ran
as
follows
read
what
the
king
says
to
me
and
sleep
well
the
king
note
was
thus
conceived
branicki
my
dear
uncle
is
dangerous
wounded
my
surgeons
are
doing
all
they
can
for
him
but
i
have
not
forgotten
casanova
you
may
assure
him
that
he
is
pardoned
even
if
branicki
should
die
i
kissed
the
letter
gratefully
and
shewed
it
to
my
visitors
who
lauded
this
generous
man
truly
worthy
of
being
a
king
after
this
pleasant
news
i
felt
in
need
of
rest
and
my
lords
left
me
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
campioni
who
had
come
in
before
and
had
stood
in
the
background
came
up
to
me
and
gave
me
back
the
packet
of
papers
and
with
tears
of
joy
congratulated
me
on
the
happy
issue
of
the
duel
next
day
i
had
shoals
of
visitors
and
many
of
the
chiefs
of
the
party
opposed
to
branicki
sent
me
purses
full
of
gold
the
persons
who
brought
the
money
on
behalf
of
such
a
lord
or
lady
said
that
being
a
foreigner
i
might
be
in
need
of
money
and
that
was
their
excuse
for
the
liberty
they
had
taken
i
thanked
and
refused
them
all
and
sent
back
at
least
four
thousand
ducats
and
was
very
proud
of
having
done
so
campioni
thought
it
was
absurd
and
he
was
right
for
i
repented
afterwards
of
what
i
had
done
the
only
present
i
accepted
was
a
dinner
for
four
persons
which
prince
adam
czartoryski
sent
me
in
every
day
though
the
doctor
would
not
let
me
enjoy
it
he
being
a
great
believer
in
diet
the
wound
in
my
stomach
was
progressing
favourably
but
on
the
fourth
day
the
surgeons
said
my
hand
was
becoming
gangrened
and
they
agreed
that
the
only
remedy
was
amputation
i
saw
this
announced
in
the
court
gazette
the
next
morning
but
as
i
had
other
views
on
the
matter
i
laughed
heartily
at
the
paragraph
the
sheet
was
printed
at
night
after
the
king
had
placed
his
initials
to
the
copy
in
the
morning
several
persons
came
to
condole
with
me
but
i
received
their
sympathy
with
great
irreverence
i
merely
laughed
at
count
clary
who
said
i
would
surely
submit
to
the
operation
and
just
as
he
uttered
the
words
the
three
surgeons
came
in
together
well
gentlemen
said
i
you
have
mustered
in
great
strength
why
is
this
my
ordinary
surgeon
replied
that
he
wished
to
have
the
opinion
of
the
other
two
before
proceeding
to
amputation
and
they
would
require
to
look
at
the
wound
the
dressing
was
lifted
and
gangrene
was
declared
to
be
undoubtedly
present
and
execution
was
ordered
that
evening
the
butchers
gave
me
the
news
with
radiant
faces
and
assured
me
i
need
not
be
afraid
as
the
operation
would
certainly
prove
efficacious
gentlemen
i
replied
you
seem
to
have
a
great
many
solid
scientific
reasons
for
cutting
off
my
hand
but
one
thing
you
have
not
got
and
that
is
my
consent
my
hand
is
my
own
and
i
am
going
to
keep
it
sir
it
is
certainly
gangrened
by
the
arm
will
begin
to
mortify
and
then
you
will
have
to
lose
your
arm
very
good
if
that
prove
so
you
shall
cut
off
my
arm
but
i
happen
to
know
something
of
gangrene
and
there
is
none
about
me
you
can
not
know
as
much
about
it
as
we
do
possibly
but
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
you
know
nothing
at
all
that
rather
a
strong
expression
i
do
care
whether
it
be
strong
or
weak
you
can
go
now
in
a
couple
of
hours
everyone
whom
the
surgeons
had
told
of
my
obstinacy
came
pestering
me
even
the
wrote
to
me
that
the
king
was
extremely
surprised
at
my
lack
of
courage
this
stung
me
to
the
quick
and
i
wrote
the
king
a
long
letter
half
in
earnest
and
half
in
jest
in
which
i
laughed
at
the
ignorance
of
the
surgeons
and
at
the
simplicity
of
those
who
took
whatever
they
said
for
gospel
truth
i
added
that
as
an
arm
without
a
hand
would
be
quite
as
useless
as
no
arm
at
all
i
meant
to
wait
till
it
was
necessary
to
cut
off
the
arm
my
letter
was
read
at
court
and
people
wondered
how
a
man
with
gangrene
could
write
a
long
letter
of
four
pages
lubomirski
told
me
kindly
that
i
was
mistaken
in
laughing
at
my
friends
for
the
three
best
surgeons
in
warsaw
could
not
be
mistaken
in
such
a
simple
case
my
lord
they
are
not
deceived
themselves
but
they
want
to
deceive
me
why
should
they
to
make
themselves
agreeable
to
branicki
who
is
in
a
dangerous
state
and
might
possibly
get
better
if
he
heard
that
my
hand
had
been
taken
off
really
that
seems
an
incredible
idea
to
me
what
will
your
highness
say
on
the
day
when
i
am
proved
to
be
right
i
shall
say
you
are
deserving
of
the
highest
praise
but
the
day
must
first
come
we
shall
see
this
evening
and
i
give
you
my
word
that
if
any
gangrene
has
attacked
the
arm
i
will
have
it
cut
off
morning
four
surgeons
came
to
see
me
my
arm
was
pronounced
to
be
highly
aedematous
and
of
a
livid
colour
up
to
the
elbow
but
when
the
lint
was
taken
off
the
wound
i
could
see
for
myself
that
it
was
progressing
admirably
however
i
concealed
my
delight
prince
augustus
sulkowski
and
the
abbe
gouvel
were
present
the
latter
being
attached
to
the
court
the
judgment
of
the
surgeons
was
that
the
arm
was
gangrened
and
must
be
amputated
by
the
next
morning
at
latest
i
was
tired
of
arguing
with
these
rascals
so
i
told
them
to
bring
their
instruments
and
that
i
would
submit
to
the
operation
at
this
they
went
way
in
high
glee
to
tell
the
news
at
the
court
to
branicki
to
the
palatin
and
so
forth
i
merely
gave
my
servants
orders
to
send
them
away
when
they
came
i
can
dwell
no
more
on
this
matter
though
it
is
interesting
enough
to
me
however
the
reader
will
no
doubt
be
obliged
to
me
by
my
simply
saying
that
a
french
surgeon
in
prince
sulkowski
household
took
charge
of
the
case
in
defiance
of
professional
etiquette
and
cured
me
perfectly
so
i
have
my
hand
and
my
arm
to
this
day
on
easter
day
i
went
to
mass
with
my
arm
in
a
sling
my
cure
had
only
lasted
three
weeks
but
i
was
not
able
to
put
the
hand
to
any
active
employment
for
eighteen
months
afterwards
everyone
was
obliged
to
congratulate
me
on
having
held
out
against
the
amputation
and
the
general
consent
declared
the
surgeons
grossly
ignorant
while
i
was
satisfied
with
thinking
them
very
great
knaves
i
must
here
set
down
an
incident
which
happened
three
days
after
the
duel
i
was
told
that
a
jesuit
father
from
the
bishop
of
the
diocese
wanted
to
speak
to
me
in
private
and
i
had
him
shewn
in
and
asked
him
what
he
wanted
i
have
come
from
my
said
he
to
absolve
you
from
the
ecclesiastical
censure
which
you
have
incurred
by
duelling
i
am
always
delighted
to
receive
absolution
father
but
only
after
i
have
confessed
my
guilt
in
the
present
case
i
have
nothing
to
confess
i
was
attacked
and
i
defended
myself
pray
thank
my
lord
for
his
kindness
if
you
like
to
absolve
me
without
confession
i
shall
be
much
obliged
if
you
do
not
confess
i
can
not
give
you
absolution
but
you
can
do
this
ask
me
to
absolve
you
supposing
you
have
fought
a
duel
certainly
i
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
absolve
me
supposing
i
have
fought
a
duel
the
delightful
jesuit
gave
me
absolution
in
similar
terms
he
was
like
his
brethren
never
at
a
loss
when
a
loophole
of
any
kind
is
required
three
days
before
i
left
the
monastery
that
is
on
holy
thursday
the
marshal
withdrew
my
guard
after
i
had
been
to
mass
on
easter
day
i
went
to
court
and
as
i
kissed
the
king
hand
he
asked
me
as
had
been
arranged
why
i
wore
my
arm
in
a
sling
i
said
i
had
been
suffering
from
a
rheum
and
he
replied
with
a
meaning
smile
take
care
not
to
catch
another
after
my
visit
to
the
king
i
called
on
branicki
who
had
made
daily
enquiries
after
my
health
and
had
sent
me
back
my
sword
he
was
condemned
to
stay
in
bed
for
six
weeks
longer
at
least
for
the
wad
of
my
pistol
had
got
into
the
wound
and
in
extracting
it
the
opening
had
to
be
enlarged
which
retarded
his
recovery
the
king
had
just
appointed
him
chief
huntsman
not
so
exalted
an
office
as
chamberlain
but
a
more
lucrative
one
it
was
said
he
had
got
the
place
because
he
was
such
a
good
shot
but
if
that
were
the
reason
i
had
a
better
claim
to
it
for
i
had
proved
the
better
shot
for
one
day
at
all
events
i
entered
an
enormous
in
which
stood
officers
footmen
pages
and
lacqueys
all
gazing
at
me
with
the
greatest
astonishment
i
asked
if
my
lord
was
to
be
seen
and
begged
the
to
send
in
my
name
he
did
not
answer
but
sighed
and
went
into
his
master
room
directly
after
he
came
out
and
begged
me
with
a
profound
bow
to
step
in
branicki
who
was
dressed
in
a
magnificent
gown
and
supported
by
pillows
and
cushions
greeted
me
by
taking
off
his
nightcap
he
was
as
pale
as
death
i
have
come
here
my
lord
i
began
to
offer
you
my
service
and
to
assure
you
how
i
regret
that
i
did
not
pass
over
a
few
trifling
words
of
yours
you
have
no
reason
to
reproach
yourself
m
casanova
your
excellency
is
very
kind
i
am
also
come
to
say
that
by
fighting
with
me
you
have
done
me
an
honour
which
completely
swallows
up
all
offence
and
i
trust
that
you
will
give
me
your
protection
for
the
future
i
confess
i
insulted
you
but
you
will
allow
that
i
have
paid
for
it
as
to
my
friends
i
openly
say
that
they
are
my
enemies
unless
they
treat
you
with
respect
bininski
has
been
cashiered
and
his
nobility
taken
from
him
he
is
well
served
as
to
my
protection
you
have
no
need
of
it
the
king
esteems
you
highly
like
myself
and
all
men
of
honour
sit
down
we
will
be
friends
a
cup
of
chocolate
for
this
gentleman
you
seem
to
have
got
over
your
wound
completely
quite
so
my
lord
except
as
to
the
use
of
my
fingers
and
that
will
take
some
time
you
were
quite
right
to
withstand
those
rascally
surgeons
and
you
had
good
reason
for
your
opinion
that
the
fools
thought
to
please
me
by
rendering
you
they
judged
my
heart
by
their
own
i
congratulate
you
on
the
preservation
of
your
hand
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
make
out
how
my
ball
could
have
wounded
you
in
the
hand
after
striking
your
stomach
just
then
the
chocolate
was
brought
and
the
chamberlain
came
in
and
looked
at
me
with
a
smile
in
five
minutes
the
room
was
full
of
lords
and
ladies
who
had
heard
i
was
with
branicki
and
wanted
to
know
how
we
were
getting
on
i
could
see
that
they
did
not
expect
to
find
us
on
such
good
terms
and
were
agreeably
surprised
branicki
asked
the
question
which
had
been
interrupted
by
the
chocolate
and
the
visitors
over
again
your
excellency
will
allow
me
to
assume
the
position
i
was
in
as
i
received
your
fire
pray
do
so
i
rose
and
placed
myself
in
the
position
and
he
said
he
understood
how
it
was
a
lady
said
you
should
have
put
your
hand
behind
your
body
excuse
me
madam
but
i
thought
it
better
to
put
my
body
behind
my
hand
this
sally
made
branicki
laugh
but
his
sister
said
to
me
you
wanted
to
kill
my
brother
for
you
aimed
at
his
head
god
forbid
madam
my
interest
lay
in
keeping
him
alive
to
defend
me
from
his
friends
but
you
said
you
were
going
to
fire
at
his
head
that
a
mere
figure
of
speech
just
as
one
says
blow
your
brains
out
the
skilled
duellist
however
always
aims
at
the
middle
of
the
body
the
head
does
not
offer
a
large
enough
surface
yes
said
branicki
your
tactics
were
superior
to
mine
and
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
the
lesson
you
gave
me
your
excellency
gave
me
a
lesson
in
heroism
of
far
greater
value
you
must
have
had
a
great
deal
of
practice
with
the
pistol
continued
his
sister
not
at
all
madam
i
regard
the
weapon
with
detestation
this
unlucky
shot
was
my
first
but
i
have
always
known
a
straight
line
and
my
hand
has
always
been
steady
that
all
one
wants
said
branicki
i
have
those
advantages
myself
and
i
am
only
too
well
pleased
that
i
did
not
aim
so
well
as
usual
your
ball
broke
my
first
phalanges
here
it
is
you
see
flattened
by
my
bone
allow
me
to
return
it
to
you
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
ca
return
yours
which
i
suppose
remains
on
the
field
of
battle
you
seem
to
be
getting
better
thank
god
the
wound
is
healing
painfully
if
i
had
imitated
you
i
should
no
longer
be
in
the
land
of
the
living
i
am
told
you
made
an
excellent
dinner
yes
my
lord
i
was
afraid
i
might
never
have
another
chance
of
dining
again
if
i
had
dined
your
ball
would
have
pierced
my
intestines
but
being
empty
it
yielded
to
the
bullet
and
let
it
pass
by
harmlessly
i
heard
afterwards
that
on
the
day
of
the
duel
branicki
had
gone
to
confession
and
mass
and
had
communicated
the
priest
could
not
refuse
him
absolution
if
he
said
that
honour
obliged
him
to
fight
for
this
was
in
accordance
with
the
ancient
laws
of
chivalry
as
for
me
i
only
addressed
these
words
to
god
lord
if
my
enemy
kill
me
i
shall
be
damned
deign
therefore
to
preserve
me
from
death
amen
after
a
long
and
pleasant
conversation
i
took
leave
of
the
hero
to
visit
the
high
constable
count
bielinski
brother
of
countess
salmor
he
was
a
very
old
man
but
the
sovereign
administrator
of
justice
in
poland
i
had
never
spoken
to
him
but
he
had
defended
me
from
branicki
uhlans
and
had
made
out
my
pardon
so
i
felt
bound
to
go
and
thank
him
i
sent
in
my
name
and
the
worthy
old
man
greeted
me
with
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
have
come
to
kiss
the
hand
of
the
kindly
man
that
signed
my
pardon
and
to
promise
your
excellency
to
be
more
discreet
in
future
i
advise
you
to
be
more
discreet
indeed
as
for
your
pardon
thank
the
king
for
if
he
had
not
requested
me
especially
to
grant
it
you
i
should
have
had
you
beheaded
in
spite
of
the
extenuating
circumstances
my
lord
what
circumstances
did
you
or
did
you
not
fight
a
duel
that
is
not
a
proper
way
of
putting
it
i
was
obliged
to
defend
myself
you
might
have
charged
me
with
fighting
a
duel
if
branicki
had
taken
me
outside
the
ban
as
i
requested
but
as
it
was
he
took
me
where
he
willed
and
made
me
fight
under
these
circumstances
i
am
sure
your
excellency
would
have
spared
my
head
i
really
ca
say
the
king
requested
that
you
should
be
pardoned
and
that
shews
he
believes
you
to
be
deserving
of
pardon
i
congratulate
you
on
his
good
will
i
shall
be
pleased
if
you
will
dine
with
me
tomorrow
my
lord
i
am
delighted
to
accept
your
invitation
the
illustrious
old
constable
was
a
man
of
great
intelligence
he
had
been
a
of
the
celebrated
poniatowski
the
king
father
we
had
a
good
deal
of
conversation
together
at
dinner
the
next
day
what
a
comfort
it
would
have
been
to
your
excellency
friend
said
i
if
he
could
have
lived
to
see
his
son
crowned
king
of
poland
he
would
never
have
consented
the
vehemence
with
which
he
pronounced
these
words
gave
me
a
deep
insight
into
his
feelings
he
was
of
the
saxon
party
the
same
day
that
is
on
easter
day
i
dined
at
the
palatin
political
reasons
said
he
prevented
me
from
visiting
you
at
the
monastery
but
you
must
not
think
i
had
forgotten
you
for
you
were
constantly
in
my
thoughts
i
am
going
to
lodge
you
here
for
my
wife
is
very
fond
of
your
society
but
the
rooms
will
not
be
ready
for
another
six
weeks
i
shall
take
the
opportunity
my
lord
of
paying
a
visit
to
the
palatin
of
kiowia
who
has
honoured
me
with
an
invitation
to
come
and
see
him
who
gave
you
the
invitation
count
bruhl
who
is
at
dresden
his
wife
is
daughter
of
the
palatin
this
journey
is
an
excellent
idea
for
this
duel
of
yours
has
made
you
innumerable
enemies
and
i
only
hope
you
will
have
to
fight
no
more
duels
i
give
you
fair
warning
be
on
your
guard
and
never
go
on
foot
especially
at
night
i
spent
a
fortnight
in
going
out
to
dinner
and
supper
every
day
i
had
become
the
fashion
and
wherever
i
went
i
had
to
tell
the
duel
story
over
again
i
was
rather
tired
of
it
myself
but
the
wish
to
please
and
my
own
were
too
strong
to
be
resisted
the
king
was
nearly
always
present
but
feigned
not
to
hear
me
however
he
once
asked
me
if
i
had
been
insulted
by
a
patrician
in
venice
whether
i
should
have
called
him
out
immediately
no
sire
for
his
patrician
pride
would
have
prevented
his
complying
and
i
should
have
had
my
pains
for
my
trouble
then
what
would
you
have
done
sire
i
should
have
contained
myself
though
if
a
noble
venetian
were
to
insult
me
in
a
foreign
country
he
would
have
to
give
me
satisfaction
i
called
on
prince
moszczinski
and
madame
binetti
happened
to
be
there
the
moment
she
saw
me
she
made
her
escape
what
has
she
against
me
i
asked
the
count
she
is
afraid
of
you
because
she
was
the
cause
of
the
duel
and
now
branicki
who
was
her
lover
will
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
her
she
hoped
he
would
serve
you
as
he
served
tomatis
and
instead
of
that
you
almost
killed
her
bravo
she
lays
the
fault
on
him
for
having
accepted
your
challenge
but
he
has
resolved
to
have
done
with
her
this
count
moszczinski
was
both
and
and
so
generous
that
he
ruined
himself
by
making
presents
his
wounds
were
beginning
to
heal
but
though
i
was
the
indirect
cause
of
his
mishap
far
from
bearing
malice
against
me
he
had
become
my
friend
the
person
whom
i
should
have
expected
to
be
most
grateful
to
me
for
the
duel
was
tomatis
but
on
the
contrary
he
hated
the
sight
of
me
and
hardly
concealed
his
feelings
i
was
the
living
reproach
of
his
cowardice
my
wounded
hand
seemed
to
shew
him
that
he
had
loved
his
money
more
than
his
honour
i
am
sure
he
would
have
preferred
branicki
to
have
killed
me
for
then
he
would
have
become
an
object
of
general
execration
and
tomatis
would
have
been
received
with
less
contempt
in
the
great
houses
he
still
frequented
i
resolved
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
discontented
party
who
had
only
recognized
the
new
king
on
compulsion
and
some
of
whom
had
not
recognized
him
at
all
so
i
set
out
with
my
true
friend
campioni
and
one
servant
prince
charles
of
courland
had
started
for
venice
where
i
had
given
him
letters
for
my
illustrious
friends
who
would
make
his
visit
a
pleasant
one
the
english
ambassador
who
had
given
me
an
introduction
to
prince
adam
had
just
arrived
at
warsaw
i
dined
with
him
at
the
prince
house
and
the
king
signified
his
wish
to
be
of
the
party
i
heard
a
good
deal
of
conversation
about
madame
de
geoffrin
an
old
sweetheart
of
the
whom
he
had
just
summoned
to
warsaw
the
polish
monarch
of
whom
i
can
not
speak
in
too
favourable
terms
was
yet
weak
enough
to
listen
to
the
slanderous
reports
against
me
and
refused
to
make
my
fortune
i
had
the
pleasure
of
convincing
him
that
he
was
mistaken
but
i
will
speak
of
this
later
on
i
arrived
at
leopol
the
sixth
day
after
i
had
left
warsaw
having
stopped
a
couple
of
days
at
prince
zamoiski
he
had
forty
thousand
ducats
but
also
the
falling
sickness
i
would
give
all
my
goods
said
he
to
be
cured
i
pitied
his
young
wife
she
was
very
fond
of
him
and
yet
had
to
deny
him
for
his
disease
always
came
on
him
in
moments
of
amorous
excitement
she
had
the
bitter
task
of
constantly
refusing
him
and
even
of
running
away
if
he
pressed
her
hard
this
great
nobleman
who
died
soon
after
lodged
me
in
a
splendid
room
utterly
devoid
of
furniture
this
is
the
polish
custom
one
is
supposed
to
bring
one
furniture
with
one
at
leopol
i
put
up
at
an
hotel
but
i
soon
had
to
move
from
thence
to
take
up
my
abode
with
the
famous
kaminska
the
deadly
foe
of
branicki
the
king
and
all
that
party
she
was
very
rich
but
she
has
since
been
ruined
by
conspiracies
she
entertained
me
sumptuously
for
a
week
but
the
visit
was
agreeable
to
neither
side
as
she
could
only
speak
polish
and
german
from
leopol
i
proceeded
to
a
small
town
the
name
of
which
i
forget
the
polish
names
are
very
crabbed
to
take
an
introduction
from
prince
lubomirski
to
joseph
rzewuski
a
little
old
man
who
wore
a
long
beard
as
a
sign
of
mourning
for
the
innovations
that
were
being
introduced
into
his
country
he
was
rich
learned
superstitiously
religious
and
polite
exceedingly
i
stayed
with
him
for
three
days
he
was
the
commander
of
a
stronghold
containing
a
garrison
of
five
hundred
men
on
the
first
day
as
i
was
in
his
room
with
some
other
officers
about
eleven
in
the
morning
another
officer
came
in
whispered
to
rzewuski
and
then
came
up
to
me
and
whispered
in
my
ear
venice
and
st
mark
mark
i
answered
aloud
is
the
patron
saint
and
protector
of
venice
and
everybody
began
to
laugh
it
dawned
upon
me
that
venice
and
mark
was
the
watchword
and
i
began
to
apologize
profusely
and
the
word
was
changed
the
old
commander
spoke
to
me
with
great
politeness
he
never
went
to
court
but
he
had
resolved
on
going
to
the
diet
to
oppose
the
russian
party
with
all
his
might
the
poor
man
a
pole
of
the
true
old
leaven
was
one
of
the
four
whom
repnin
arrested
and
sent
to
siberia
after
taking
leave
of
this
brave
patriot
i
went
to
christianpol
where
lived
the
famous
palatin
potocki
who
had
been
one
of
the
lovers
of
the
empress
anna
ivanovna
he
had
founded
the
town
in
which
he
lived
and
called
it
after
his
own
name
this
nobleman
still
a
fine
man
kept
a
splendid
court
he
honoured
count
bruhl
by
keeping
me
at
his
house
for
a
fortnight
and
sending
me
out
every
day
with
his
doctor
the
famous
styrneus
the
sworn
foe
of
van
swieten
a
still
more
famous
physician
although
styrneus
was
undoubtedly
a
learned
man
i
thought
him
somewhat
extravagant
and
empirical
his
system
was
that
of
asclepiades
considered
as
exploded
since
the
time
of
the
great
boerhaave
nevertheless
he
effected
wonderful
cures
in
the
evenings
i
was
always
with
the
palatin
and
his
court
play
was
not
heavy
and
i
always
won
which
was
fortunate
and
indeed
necessary
for
me
after
an
extremely
agreeable
visit
to
the
palatin
i
returned
to
leopol
where
i
amused
myself
for
a
week
with
a
pretty
girl
who
afterwards
so
captivated
count
potocki
starost
of
sniatin
that
he
married
her
this
is
purity
of
blood
with
a
vengeance
in
your
noble
families
leaving
leopol
i
went
to
palavia
a
splendid
palace
on
the
vistula
eighteen
leagues
distant
from
warsaw
it
belonged
to
the
prince
palatin
who
had
built
it
himself
howsoever
magnificent
an
abode
may
be
a
lonely
man
will
weary
of
it
unless
he
has
the
solace
of
books
or
of
some
great
idea
i
had
neither
and
boredom
soon
made
itself
felt
a
pretty
peasant
girl
came
into
my
room
and
finding
her
to
my
taste
i
tried
to
make
her
understand
me
without
the
use
of
speech
but
she
resisted
and
shouted
so
loudly
that
the
came
up
and
asked
me
coolly
if
you
like
the
girl
why
do
you
go
the
proper
way
to
work
what
way
is
that
speak
to
her
father
who
is
at
hand
and
arrange
the
matter
amicably
i
do
know
polish
will
you
carry
the
thing
through
certainly
i
suppose
you
will
give
fifty
florins
you
are
laughing
at
me
i
will
give
a
hundred
willingly
provided
she
is
a
maid
and
is
as
submissive
as
a
lamb
no
doubt
the
arrangement
was
made
without
difficulty
for
our
hymen
took
place
the
same
evening
but
no
sooner
was
the
operation
completed
than
the
poor
lamb
fled
away
in
hot
haste
which
made
me
suspect
that
her
father
had
used
rather
forcible
persuasion
with
her
i
would
not
have
allowed
this
had
i
been
aware
of
it
the
next
morning
several
girls
were
offered
to
me
but
the
faces
of
all
of
them
were
covered
where
is
the
girl
said
i
i
want
to
see
her
face
never
mind
about
the
face
if
the
rest
is
all
right
the
face
is
the
essential
part
for
me
i
replied
and
the
rest
i
look
upon
as
an
accessory
he
did
not
understand
this
however
they
were
uncovered
but
none
of
their
faces
excited
my
desires
as
a
rule
the
polish
women
are
ugly
a
beauty
is
a
miracle
and
a
pretty
woman
a
rare
exception
at
the
end
of
a
week
of
feasting
and
weariness
i
returned
to
warsaw
in
this
manner
i
saw
podolia
and
volkynia
which
were
rebaptized
a
few
years
later
by
the
names
of
galicia
and
lodomeria
for
they
are
now
part
of
the
austrian
empire
it
is
said
however
that
they
are
more
prosperous
than
they
ever
were
before
at
warsaw
i
found
madame
geoffrin
the
object
of
universal
admiration
and
everybody
was
remarking
with
what
simplicity
she
was
dressed
as
for
myself
i
was
received
not
coldly
but
positively
rudely
people
said
to
my
face
we
did
not
expect
to
see
you
here
again
why
did
you
come
back
to
pay
my
debts
this
behaviour
astonished
and
disgusted
me
the
even
seemed
quite
changed
towards
me
i
was
still
invited
to
dinner
but
no
one
spoke
to
me
however
prince
adam
sister
asked
me
very
kindly
to
come
and
sup
with
her
and
i
accepted
the
invitation
with
delight
i
found
myself
seated
opposite
the
king
who
did
not
speak
one
word
to
me
the
whole
time
he
had
never
behaved
to
me
thus
before
the
next
day
i
dined
with
the
countess
oginski
and
in
the
course
of
dinner
the
countess
asked
where
the
king
had
supper
the
night
before
nobody
seemed
to
know
and
i
did
not
answer
just
as
we
were
rising
general
roniker
came
in
and
the
question
was
repeated
at
princess
strasnikowa
said
the
general
and
casanova
was
there
then
why
did
you
not
answer
my
question
said
the
countess
to
me
because
i
am
very
sorry
to
have
been
there
his
majesty
neither
spoke
to
me
nor
looked
at
me
i
see
i
am
in
disgrace
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
know
not
why
on
leaving
the
house
i
went
to
call
on
prince
augustus
sulkowski
who
welcomed
me
as
of
old
but
told
me
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
in
returning
to
warsaw
as
public
opinion
was
against
me
what
have
i
done
nothing
but
the
poles
are
always
inconstant
and
changeable
virtus
veluti
extra
ipsos
this
inconstancy
will
cost
us
dear
sooner
or
later
your
fortune
was
made
but
you
missed
the
turn
of
the
tide
and
i
advise
you
to
go
i
will
certainly
do
so
but
it
seems
to
me
rather
hard
when
i
got
home
my
servant
gave
me
a
letter
which
some
unknown
person
had
left
at
my
door
i
opened
it
and
found
it
to
be
anonymous
but
i
could
see
it
came
from
a
the
writer
said
that
the
slanderers
had
got
the
ears
of
the
king
and
that
i
was
no
longer
a
persona
grata
at
court
as
he
had
been
assured
that
the
parisians
had
burnt
me
in
effigy
for
my
absconding
with
the
lottery
money
and
that
i
had
been
a
strolling
player
in
italy
and
little
better
than
a
vagabond
such
calumnies
are
easy
to
utter
but
hard
to
refute
in
a
foreign
country
at
all
courts
hatred
born
of
envy
is
ever
at
work
i
might
have
despised
the
slanders
and
left
the
country
but
i
had
contracted
debts
and
had
not
sufficient
money
to
pay
them
and
my
expenses
to
portugal
where
i
thought
i
might
do
something
i
no
longer
saw
any
company
with
the
exception
of
campioni
who
seemed
more
distressed
than
myself
i
wrote
to
venice
and
everywhere
else
where
there
was
a
chance
of
my
getting
funds
but
one
day
the
general
who
had
been
present
at
the
duel
called
on
me
and
told
me
though
he
seemed
ashamed
of
his
task
that
the
king
requested
me
to
leave
the
ban
in
the
course
of
a
week
such
a
piece
of
insolence
made
my
blood
boil
and
i
informed
the
general
that
he
might
tell
the
king
that
i
did
not
feel
inclined
to
obey
such
an
unjust
order
and
that
if
i
left
i
would
let
all
the
world
know
that
i
had
been
compelled
to
do
so
by
brute
force
i
can
not
take
such
a
message
as
that
said
the
general
kindly
i
shall
simply
tell
the
king
that
i
have
executed
his
orders
and
no
more
but
of
course
you
must
follow
your
own
judgment
in
the
excess
of
my
indignation
i
wrote
to
the
king
that
i
could
not
obey
his
orders
and
keep
my
honour
i
said
in
my
letter
my
creditors
sire
will
forgive
me
for
leaving
poland
without
paying
my
debts
when
they
learn
that
i
have
only
done
so
because
your
majesty
gave
me
no
choice
i
was
thinking
how
i
could
ensure
this
letter
reaching
the
king
when
who
should
arrive
but
count
moszczinski
i
told
him
what
had
happened
and
asked
if
he
could
suggest
any
means
of
delivering
tire
letter
give
it
to
me
said
he
i
will
place
it
in
the
king
hands
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
i
went
out
to
take
the
air
and
called
on
prince
sulkowski
who
was
not
at
all
astonished
at
my
news
as
if
to
sweeten
the
bitter
pill
i
had
to
swallow
he
told
me
how
the
empress
of
austria
had
ordered
him
to
leave
vienna
in
hours
merely
because
he
had
complimented
the
archduchess
christina
on
behalf
of
prince
louis
of
wurtemberg
the
next
day
count
moszczinski
brought
me
a
present
of
a
thousand
ducats
from
the
king
who
said
that
my
leaving
warsaw
would
probably
be
the
means
of
preserving
my
life
as
in
that
city
i
was
exposed
to
danger
which
i
could
not
expect
to
escape
eventually
this
referred
to
five
or
six
challenges
i
had
received
and
to
which
i
had
not
even
taken
the
trouble
to
reply
my
enemies
might
possibly
assassinate
me
and
the
king
did
not
care
to
be
constantly
anxious
on
my
account
count
moszczinski
added
that
the
order
to
leave
carried
no
dishonour
with
it
considering
by
whom
it
had
been
delivered
and
the
delay
it
gave
me
to
make
my
preparations
the
consequence
of
all
this
was
that
i
not
only
gave
my
word
to
go
but
that
i
begged
the
count
to
thank
his
majesty
for
his
kindness
and
the
interest
he
had
been
pleased
to
take
in
me
when
i
gave
in
the
generous
moszczinski
embraced
me
begged
me
to
write
to
him
and
accept
a
present
of
a
travelling
carriage
as
a
token
of
his
friendship
he
informed
me
that
madame
binetti
husband
had
gone
off
with
his
wife
maid
taking
with
him
her
diamonds
jewels
linen
and
even
her
silver
plate
leaving
her
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
dancer
pic
her
admirers
had
clubbed
together
to
make
up
to
her
for
what
her
husband
had
stolen
i
also
heard
that
the
king
sister
had
arrived
at
warsaw
from
bialistock
and
it
was
hoped
that
her
husband
would
follow
her
this
husband
was
the
real
count
branicki
and
the
branicki
or
rather
branecki
or
bragnecki
who
had
fought
with
me
was
no
relation
to
him
whatever
the
following
day
i
paid
my
debts
which
amounted
to
about
two
hundred
ducats
and
i
made
preparations
for
starting
for
breslau
the
day
after
with
count
clary
each
of
us
having
his
own
carriage
clary
was
one
of
those
men
to
whom
lying
has
become
a
sort
of
second
nature
whenever
such
an
one
opens
his
mouth
you
may
safely
say
to
him
you
have
lied
or
you
are
going
to
lie
if
they
could
feel
their
own
degradation
they
would
be
much
to
be
pitied
for
by
their
own
fault
at
last
no
one
will
believe
them
even
when
by
chance
they
speak
the
truth
this
count
clary
who
was
not
one
of
the
clarys
of
teplitz
could
neither
go
to
his
own
country
nor
to
vienna
because
he
had
deserted
the
army
on
the
eve
of
a
battle
he
was
lame
but
he
walked
so
adroitly
that
his
defect
did
not
appear
if
this
had
been
the
only
truth
he
concealed
it
would
have
been
well
for
it
was
a
piece
of
deception
that
hurt
no
one
he
died
miserably
in
venice
we
reached
breslau
in
perfect
safety
and
without
experiencing
any
adventures
campioni
who
had
accompanied
me
as
far
as
wurtemburg
returned
but
rejoined
me
at
vienna
in
the
course
of
seven
months
count
clary
had
left
breslau
and
i
thought
i
would
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
abbe
bastiani
a
celebrated
venetian
whose
fortune
had
been
made
by
the
king
of
prussia
he
was
canon
of
the
cathedral
and
received
me
cordially
in
fact
each
mutually
desired
the
other
acquaintance
he
was
a
fine
man
and
at
least
six
feet
high
he
was
also
witty
learned
eloquent
and
gifted
with
a
persuasive
voice
his
cook
was
an
artist
his
library
full
of
choice
volumes
and
his
cellar
a
very
good
one
he
was
well
lodged
on
the
ground
floor
and
on
the
first
floor
he
accommodated
a
lady
of
whose
children
he
was
very
fond
possibly
because
he
was
their
father
although
a
great
admirer
of
the
fair
sex
his
tastes
were
by
no
means
exclusive
and
he
did
not
despise
love
of
the
greek
or
philosophic
kind
i
could
see
that
he
entertained
a
passion
for
a
young
priest
whom
i
met
at
his
table
this
young
abbe
was
count
di
cavalcano
and
bastiani
seemed
to
adore
him
if
fiery
glances
signified
anything
but
the
innocent
young
man
did
not
seem
to
understand
and
i
suppose
bastiani
did
not
like
to
lower
his
dignity
by
declaring
his
love
the
canon
shewed
me
all
the
letters
he
had
received
from
the
king
of
prussia
before
he
had
been
made
canon
he
was
the
son
of
a
tailor
at
venice
and
became
a
friar
but
having
committed
some
peccadillo
which
got
him
into
trouble
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
able
to
make
his
escape
he
fled
to
the
hague
and
there
met
tron
the
venetian
ambassador
who
lent
him
a
hundred
ducats
with
which
he
made
his
way
to
berlin
and
favour
with
the
king
such
are
the
ways
by
which
men
arrive
at
fortune
deum
on
the
event
of
my
departure
from
breslau
i
went
to
pay
a
call
on
a
baroness
for
whom
i
had
a
letter
of
introduction
from
her
son
who
was
an
officer
of
the
polish
court
i
sent
up
my
name
and
was
asked
to
wait
a
few
moments
as
the
baroness
was
dressing
i
sat
down
beside
a
pretty
girl
who
was
neatly
dressed
in
a
mantle
with
a
hood
i
asked
her
if
she
were
waiting
for
the
baroness
like
myself
yes
sir
she
replied
i
have
come
to
offer
myself
as
governess
for
her
three
daughters
what
governess
at
your
age
alas
sir
age
has
nothing
to
do
with
necessity
i
have
neither
father
nor
mother
my
brother
is
a
poor
lieutenant
who
can
not
help
me
what
can
i
do
i
can
only
get
a
livelihood
by
turning
my
good
education
to
account
what
will
your
salary
be
fifty
wretched
crowns
enough
to
buy
my
dresses
it
very
little
it
is
as
much
as
people
give
where
are
you
living
now
with
a
poor
aunt
where
i
can
scarce
earn
enough
bread
to
keep
me
alive
by
sewing
from
morning
till
night
if
you
liked
to
become
my
governess
instead
of
becoming
a
governess
i
would
give
you
fifty
crowns
not
per
year
but
per
month
your
governess
governess
to
your
family
you
mean
i
suppose
i
have
no
family
i
am
a
bachelor
and
i
spend
my
time
in
travelling
i
leave
at
five
morning
for
dresden
and
if
you
like
to
come
with
me
there
is
a
place
for
you
in
my
carriage
i
am
staying
at
such
an
inn
come
there
with
your
trunk
and
we
will
start
together
you
are
joking
besides
i
do
know
you
i
am
not
jesting
and
we
should
get
to
know
each
other
perfectly
well
in
hours
that
is
ample
time
my
serious
air
convinced
the
girl
that
i
was
not
laughing
at
her
but
she
was
still
very
much
astonished
while
i
was
very
much
astonished
to
find
i
had
gone
so
far
when
i
had
only
intended
to
joke
in
trying
to
win
over
the
girl
i
had
won
over
myself
it
seemed
to
me
a
rare
adventure
and
i
was
delighted
to
see
that
she
was
giving
it
her
serious
attention
by
the
she
kept
casting
in
my
direction
to
see
if
i
was
laughing
at
her
i
began
to
think
that
fate
had
brought
us
together
that
i
might
become
the
architect
of
her
fortune
i
had
no
doubt
whatever
as
to
her
goodness
or
her
feelings
for
me
for
she
completely
infatuated
my
judgment
to
put
the
finishing
stroke
on
the
affair
i
drew
out
two
ducats
and
gave
them
her
as
an
earnest
of
her
first
month
wages
she
took
them
timidly
but
seemed
convinced
that
i
was
not
imposing
on
her
by
this
time
the
baroness
was
ready
and
she
welcomed
me
very
kindly
but
i
said
i
could
not
accept
her
invitation
to
dine
with
her
the
following
day
as
i
was
leaving
at
i
replied
to
all
the
questions
that
a
fond
mother
makes
concerning
her
son
and
then
took
leave
of
the
worthy
lady
as
i
went
out
i
noticed
that
the
governess
had
disappeared
the
rest
of
the
day
i
spent
with
the
canon
making
good
cheer
playing
ombre
drinking
hard
and
talking
about
girls
or
literature
the
next
day
my
carriage
came
to
the
door
at
the
time
i
had
arranged
and
i
went
off
without
thinking
of
the
girl
i
had
met
at
the
baroness
but
we
had
not
gone
two
hundred
paces
when
the
postillion
stopped
a
bundle
of
linen
whirled
through
the
window
into
the
carriage
and
the
governess
got
in
i
gave
her
a
hearty
welcome
by
embracing
her
and
made
her
sit
down
beside
me
and
so
we
drove
off
in
the
ensuing
chapter
the
reader
will
become
more
fully
acquainted
with
my
fresh
conquest
in
the
meantime
let
him
imagine
me
rolling
peacefully
along
the
dresden
road
chapter
xxiii
my
arrival
at
dresden
with
maton
she
makes
me
a
present
leipzig
castelbajac
schwerin
return
to
dresden
and
departure
i
arrive
at
vienna
pocchini
vengeance
when
i
saw
myself
in
the
carriage
with
this
pretty
girl
who
had
fallen
on
me
as
if
from
the
clouds
i
imagined
i
was
intended
to
shape
her
destiny
her
tutelary
genius
must
have
placed
her
in
my
hands
for
i
felt
inclined
to
do
her
all
the
good
that
lay
in
my
power
but
for
myself
was
it
a
piece
of
good
or
ill
luck
for
me
i
formed
the
question
but
felt
that
time
alone
could
give
the
answer
i
knew
that
i
was
still
living
in
my
old
style
while
i
was
beginning
to
feel
that
i
was
no
longer
a
young
man
i
was
sure
that
my
new
companion
could
not
have
abandoned
herself
to
me
in
this
manner
without
having
made
up
her
mind
to
be
complaisant
but
this
was
not
enough
for
me
it
was
my
humour
to
be
loved
this
was
my
chief
aim
everything
else
was
only
fleeting
enjoyment
and
as
i
had
not
had
a
love
affair
since
i
parted
with
zaira
i
hoped
most
fervently
that
the
present
adventure
would
prove
to
be
one
before
long
i
learnt
that
my
companion
name
was
maton
this
at
least
was
her
surname
and
i
did
not
feel
any
curiosity
to
know
the
name
of
the
he
or
she
saint
whom
her
godmothers
had
constituted
her
patron
at
the
baptismal
font
i
asked
her
if
she
could
write
french
as
well
as
she
spoke
it
and
she
shewed
me
a
letter
by
way
of
sample
it
assured
me
that
she
had
received
an
excellent
education
and
this
fact
increased
my
pleasure
in
the
conquest
i
had
made
she
said
she
had
left
breslau
without
telling
her
aunt
or
her
cousin
that
she
was
going
perhaps
never
to
return
how
about
your
belongings
belongings
they
were
not
worth
the
trouble
of
gathering
together
all
i
have
is
included
in
that
small
package
which
contains
a
chemise
a
pair
of
stockings
some
handkerchiefs
and
a
few
nicknacks
what
will
your
lover
say
alas
i
have
got
one
to
say
anything
i
can
not
credit
that
i
have
had
two
lovers
the
first
one
was
a
rascal
who
took
advantage
of
my
innocence
to
seduce
me
and
then
left
me
when
i
ceased
to
present
any
novelty
for
him
my
second
was
an
honest
man
but
a
poor
lieutenant
with
no
prospects
of
getting
on
he
has
not
abandoned
me
but
his
regiment
was
ordered
to
stetin
and
since
then
and
since
then
we
were
too
poor
to
write
to
one
another
so
we
had
to
suffer
in
silence
this
pathetic
history
seemed
to
bear
the
marks
of
truth
and
i
thought
it
very
possible
that
maton
had
only
come
with
me
to
make
her
fortune
or
to
do
rather
better
than
she
had
been
doing
which
would
not
be
difficult
she
was
years
old
and
as
she
had
never
been
out
of
breslau
before
she
would
doubtless
be
delighted
to
see
what
the
world
was
like
at
dresden
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
i
had
been
a
fool
to
burden
myself
with
the
girl
who
would
most
likely
cost
me
a
lot
of
money
but
still
i
found
my
conduct
excusable
as
the
chances
were
a
hundred
to
one
against
her
accepting
the
proposal
i
had
been
foolish
enough
to
make
in
short
i
resolved
to
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
having
a
pretty
girl
all
to
myself
and
i
determined
not
to
do
anything
during
the
journey
being
anxious
to
see
whether
her
moral
qualities
would
plead
as
strongly
with
me
as
her
physical
beauty
undoubtedly
did
at
nightfall
i
stopped
wishing
to
spend
the
night
at
the
maton
who
had
been
very
hungry
all
day
but
had
not
dared
to
tell
me
so
ate
with
an
amazing
and
pleasing
appetite
but
not
being
accustomed
to
wine
she
would
have
fallen
asleep
at
table
if
i
had
not
begged
her
to
retire
she
begged
my
pardon
assuring
me
she
would
not
let
such
a
thing
occur
again
i
smiled
by
way
of
reply
and
stayed
at
the
table
not
looking
to
see
whether
she
undressed
or
went
to
bed
in
her
clothes
i
went
to
bed
myself
soon
after
and
at
five
was
up
again
to
order
the
coffee
and
to
see
that
the
horses
were
put
in
maton
was
lying
on
her
bed
with
all
her
clothes
on
fast
asleep
and
perspiring
with
the
heat
i
woke
her
telling
her
that
another
time
she
must
sleep
more
comfortably
as
such
heats
were
injurious
to
health
she
got
up
and
left
the
room
no
doubt
to
wash
for
she
returned
looking
fresh
and
gay
and
bade
me
good
day
and
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
give
her
a
kiss
i
shall
be
delighted
i
replied
and
after
kissing
her
i
made
her
hurry
over
the
breakfast
as
i
wished
to
reach
dresden
that
evening
however
i
could
not
manage
it
my
carriage
broke
down
and
took
five
hours
to
mend
so
i
had
to
sleep
at
another
posting
station
maton
undressed
this
time
but
i
had
the
firmness
not
to
look
at
her
when
i
reached
dresden
i
put
up
at
the
hotel
de
saxe
taking
the
whole
of
the
first
floor
my
mother
was
in
the
country
and
i
paid
her
a
visit
much
to
her
delight
we
made
quite
an
affecting
picture
with
my
arm
in
a
sling
i
also
saw
my
brother
john
and
his
wife
therese
roland
and
a
roman
girl
whom
i
had
known
before
him
and
who
made
much
of
me
i
also
saw
my
sister
and
i
then
went
with
my
brother
to
pay
my
suit
to
count
bruhl
and
to
his
wife
the
daughter
of
the
palatin
of
kiowia
who
was
delighted
to
hear
news
of
her
family
i
was
welcomed
everywhere
and
everywhere
i
had
to
tell
the
story
of
my
duel
i
confess
that
very
little
pressing
was
required
for
i
was
very
proud
of
it
at
this
period
the
states
were
assembled
in
dresden
and
prince
xavier
uncle
of
the
elector
was
regent
during
his
minority
the
same
evening
i
went
to
the
where
faro
was
played
i
played
but
prudently
for
my
capital
only
consisted
of
eighteen
hundred
ducats
when
i
came
back
we
had
a
good
supper
and
maton
pleased
me
both
by
her
appetite
and
amiability
when
we
had
finished
i
affectionately
asked
her
if
she
would
like
to
share
my
bed
and
she
replied
as
tenderly
that
she
was
wholly
mine
and
so
after
passing
a
voluptuous
night
we
rose
in
the
morning
the
best
friends
in
the
world
i
spent
the
whole
morning
in
furnishing
her
toilette
a
good
many
people
called
on
me
and
wanted
to
be
presented
to
maton
but
my
answer
was
that
as
she
was
only
my
housekeeper
and
not
my
wife
i
could
not
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
her
in
the
same
way
i
had
instructed
her
that
she
was
not
to
let
anyone
in
when
i
was
away
she
was
working
in
her
room
on
the
linen
i
had
provided
for
her
aided
in
her
task
by
a
seamstress
nevertheless
i
did
not
want
to
make
her
a
slave
so
i
occasionally
took
her
into
the
pleasant
suburbs
of
dresden
where
she
was
at
liberty
to
speak
to
any
of
my
acquaintances
we
might
meet
this
reserve
of
mine
which
lasted
for
the
fortnight
we
stayed
in
dresden
was
mortifying
for
all
the
young
officers
in
the
place
and
especially
for
the
comte
de
bellegarde
who
was
not
accustomed
to
being
denied
any
girl
to
whom
he
chose
to
take
a
fancy
he
was
a
fine
young
fellow
of
great
boldness
and
even
impudence
and
one
day
he
came
into
our
room
and
asked
me
to
give
him
a
dinner
just
as
maton
and
myself
were
sitting
down
to
table
i
could
not
refuse
him
and
i
could
not
request
maton
to
leave
the
room
so
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
meal
he
showered
his
military
jokes
and
attentions
on
her
though
he
was
perfectly
polite
the
whole
time
maton
behaved
very
well
she
was
not
prudish
nor
did
she
forget
the
respect
she
owed
to
me
and
indeed
to
herself
i
was
accustomed
to
take
a
siesta
every
day
after
dinner
so
half
an
hour
after
the
conclusion
of
the
meal
i
stated
the
fact
and
begged
him
to
leave
us
he
asked
smilingly
if
the
lady
took
a
siesta
too
and
i
replied
that
we
usually
took
it
together
this
made
him
take
up
his
hat
and
cane
and
as
he
did
so
he
asked
us
both
to
dine
with
him
the
next
day
i
replied
that
i
never
took
maton
out
anywhere
but
that
he
would
be
welcome
to
come
and
take
with
us
every
day
if
he
liked
this
refusal
exhausted
his
resources
and
he
took
his
leave
if
not
angrily
at
least
very
coldly
my
mother
returned
to
her
town
apartments
which
were
opposite
to
mine
and
the
next
day
when
i
was
calling
on
her
i
noticed
the
erker
a
sort
of
grating
in
the
spanish
fashion
which
indicated
my
rooms
in
the
hotel
i
happened
to
look
in
that
direction
and
i
saw
maton
at
the
window
standing
up
and
talking
to
de
bellegarde
who
was
at
a
neighbouring
window
this
window
belonged
to
a
room
which
adjoined
my
suite
of
rooms
but
did
not
belong
to
it
this
discovery
amused
me
i
knew
what
i
was
about
and
did
not
fear
to
be
made
a
cuckold
in
spite
of
myself
i
was
sure
i
had
not
been
observed
and
i
was
not
going
to
allow
any
trespassers
i
was
jealous
in
fact
but
the
jealousy
was
of
the
mind
not
the
heart
i
came
in
to
dinner
in
the
highest
spirits
and
maton
was
as
gay
as
myself
i
led
the
conversation
up
to
bellegarde
and
said
i
believed
him
to
be
in
love
with
her
oh
he
is
like
all
officers
with
girls
but
i
do
think
he
is
more
in
love
with
me
than
any
other
girl
oh
but
did
he
come
to
call
on
me
this
morning
certainly
not
and
if
he
had
come
the
maid
would
have
told
him
you
were
out
did
you
not
notice
him
walking
up
and
down
the
windows
no
this
was
enough
for
me
i
knew
they
had
laid
a
plot
together
maton
was
deceiving
me
and
i
should
be
cheated
in
hours
unless
i
took
care
at
my
age
such
treason
should
not
have
astonished
me
but
my
vanity
would
not
allow
me
to
admit
the
fact
i
dissembled
my
feelings
and
caressed
the
traitress
and
then
leaving
the
house
i
went
to
the
theatre
where
i
played
with
some
success
and
returned
home
while
the
second
act
was
in
progress
it
was
still
daylight
the
waiter
was
at
the
door
and
i
asked
him
whether
there
were
any
rooms
besides
those
which
i
occupied
on
the
first
floor
yes
two
rooms
both
looking
on
the
street
tell
the
landlord
that
i
will
take
them
both
they
were
taken
yesterday
evening
by
whom
by
a
swiss
officer
who
is
entertaining
a
party
of
friends
to
supper
here
this
evening
i
said
no
more
lest
i
should
awaken
suspicion
but
i
felt
sure
that
bellegarde
could
easily
obtain
access
to
my
rooms
from
his
indeed
there
was
a
door
leading
to
the
room
where
maton
slept
with
her
maid
when
i
did
not
care
to
have
her
in
my
room
the
door
was
bolted
on
her
side
but
as
she
was
in
the
plot
there
was
not
much
security
in
this
i
went
upstairs
softly
and
finding
maton
on
the
balcony
i
said
after
some
indifferent
conversation
that
i
should
like
to
change
rooms
you
shall
have
my
room
i
said
and
i
will
have
yours
i
can
read
there
and
see
the
people
going
by
she
thought
it
a
very
good
idea
and
added
that
it
would
serve
us
both
if
i
would
allow
her
to
sit
there
when
i
was
out
this
reply
shewed
me
that
maton
was
an
old
hand
and
that
i
had
better
give
her
up
if
i
did
not
wish
to
be
duped
i
changed
the
rooms
and
we
supped
pleasantly
together
laughing
and
talking
and
in
spite
of
all
her
craft
maton
did
not
notice
any
change
in
me
i
remained
alone
in
my
new
room
and
soon
heard
the
voices
of
bellegarde
and
his
merry
companions
i
went
on
to
the
balcony
but
the
curtains
of
bellegarde
room
were
drawn
as
if
to
assure
me
that
there
was
no
complot
however
i
was
not
so
easily
deceived
and
i
found
afterwards
that
mercury
had
warned
jupiter
that
amphytrion
had
changed
his
room
next
day
a
severe
headache
a
thing
from
which
i
seldom
suffer
kept
me
to
the
house
all
day
i
had
myself
let
blood
and
my
worthy
mother
who
came
to
keep
me
company
dined
with
maton
my
mother
had
taken
a
weakness
for
the
girl
and
had
often
asked
me
to
let
her
come
and
see
her
but
i
had
the
good
sense
to
refuse
this
request
the
next
day
i
was
still
far
from
well
and
took
medicine
and
in
the
evening
to
my
horror
i
found
myself
attacked
by
a
fearful
disease
this
must
be
a
present
from
maton
for
i
had
not
known
anyone
else
since
leaving
leopol
i
spent
a
troubled
night
rage
and
indignation
being
my
principal
emotions
and
next
morning
coming
upon
maton
suddenly
i
found
everything
in
the
most
disgusting
state
the
wretched
creature
confessed
she
had
been
infected
for
the
last
six
months
but
that
she
had
hoped
not
to
give
it
me
as
she
had
washed
herself
carefully
whenever
she
thought
i
was
going
to
have
to
do
with
her
wretch
you
have
poisoned
me
but
nobody
shall
know
it
as
it
is
by
my
own
fault
and
i
am
ashamed
of
it
get
up
and
you
shall
see
how
generous
i
can
be
she
got
up
and
i
had
all
the
linen
i
had
given
her
packed
into
a
trunk
this
done
i
told
my
man
to
take
a
small
room
for
her
at
another
inn
his
errand
was
soon
over
and
i
then
told
maton
to
go
immediately
as
i
had
done
with
her
i
gave
her
fifty
crowns
and
made
her
sign
a
receipt
specifying
the
reason
why
i
had
sent
her
away
and
acknowledging
that
she
had
no
further
claim
upon
me
the
conditions
were
humiliating
and
she
wished
me
to
soften
them
down
but
she
soon
gave
in
when
i
told
her
that
unless
she
signed
i
would
turn
her
into
the
streets
as
naked
as
when
i
found
her
what
am
i
to
do
here
i
do
know
anyone
if
you
like
to
return
to
breslau
i
will
pay
your
expenses
there
she
made
no
answer
so
i
sent
her
away
bag
and
baggage
and
merely
turned
my
back
on
her
when
she
went
down
on
her
knees
to
excite
my
compassion
i
got
rid
of
her
without
the
slightest
feeling
of
pity
for
from
what
she
had
done
to
me
and
from
what
she
was
preparing
to
do
i
considered
her
as
a
mere
monster
who
would
sooner
or
later
have
cost
me
my
life
i
left
the
inn
the
following
day
and
i
took
a
furnished
apartment
on
the
first
floor
of
the
house
where
my
mother
lived
for
six
months
and
proceeded
about
my
cure
everyone
asked
me
what
i
had
done
with
my
housekeeper
and
i
said
that
having
no
further
need
of
her
services
i
had
sent
her
away
a
week
afterwards
my
brother
john
came
to
tell
me
that
bellegarde
and
five
or
six
of
his
friends
were
on
the
sick
list
maton
had
certainly
lost
no
time
i
am
sorry
for
them
but
it
their
own
fault
why
did
they
take
more
care
but
the
girl
came
to
dresden
with
you
yes
and
i
sent
her
about
her
business
it
was
enough
for
me
to
keep
them
off
while
she
was
under
my
charge
tell
them
that
if
they
complain
of
me
they
are
wrong
and
still
more
wrong
to
publish
their
shame
let
them
learn
discretion
and
get
themselves
cured
in
secrecy
if
they
do
not
want
sensible
men
to
laugh
at
them
do
you
think
i
am
right
the
adventure
is
not
a
very
honourable
one
for
you
i
know
it
and
that
why
i
say
nothing
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
to
proclaim
my
shame
from
the
housetops
these
friends
of
yours
must
be
simpletons
indeed
they
must
have
known
that
i
had
good
reasons
for
sending
the
girl
away
and
should
consequently
have
been
on
their
guard
they
deserve
what
they
got
and
i
hope
it
may
be
a
lesson
to
them
they
are
all
astonished
at
your
being
well
you
may
comfort
them
by
saying
that
i
have
been
as
badly
treated
as
they
but
that
i
have
held
my
tongue
not
wishing
to
pass
for
a
simpleton
poor
john
saw
he
had
been
a
simpleton
himself
and
departed
in
silence
i
put
myself
under
a
severe
diet
and
by
the
middle
of
august
my
health
was
about
this
time
prince
adam
czartoryski
sister
came
to
dresden
lodging
with
count
bruhl
i
had
the
honour
of
paying
my
court
to
her
and
i
heard
from
her
own
mouth
that
her
royal
cousin
had
had
the
weakness
to
let
himself
be
imposed
on
by
calumnies
about
me
i
told
her
that
i
was
of
ariosto
opinion
that
all
the
virtues
are
nothing
worth
unless
they
are
covered
with
the
veil
of
constancy
you
saw
yourself
when
i
supped
with
you
how
his
majesty
completely
ignored
me
your
highness
will
be
going
to
paris
next
year
you
will
meet
me
there
and
you
can
write
to
the
king
that
if
i
had
been
burnt
in
effigy
i
should
not
venture
to
shew
myself
the
september
fair
being
a
great
occasion
at
leipzig
i
went
there
to
regain
my
size
by
eating
larks
for
which
leipzig
is
justly
famous
i
had
played
a
cautious
but
a
winning
game
at
dresden
the
result
of
which
had
been
the
gain
of
some
hundreds
of
ducats
so
i
was
able
to
start
for
leipzig
with
a
letter
of
credit
for
three
thousand
crowns
on
the
banker
hohman
an
intelligent
old
man
of
upwards
of
eighty
it
was
of
him
i
heard
that
the
hair
of
the
empress
of
russia
which
looked
a
dark
brown
or
even
black
had
been
originally
quite
fair
the
old
banker
had
seen
her
at
stettin
every
day
between
her
seventh
and
tenth
years
and
told
me
that
even
then
they
had
begun
to
comb
her
hair
with
lead
combs
and
to
rub
a
certain
composition
into
it
from
an
early
age
catherine
had
been
looked
upon
as
the
future
bride
of
the
duke
of
holstein
afterwards
the
hapless
peter
iii
the
russians
are
fair
as
a
rule
and
so
it
was
thought
it
that
the
reigning
family
should
be
dark
here
i
will
note
down
a
pleasant
adventure
i
had
at
leipzig
the
princess
of
aremberg
had
arrived
from
vienna
and
was
staying
at
the
same
hotel
as
myself
she
took
a
fancy
to
go
to
the
fair
incognito
and
as
she
had
a
large
suite
she
dressed
up
one
of
her
maids
as
the
princess
and
mingled
with
her
following
i
suppose
my
readers
to
be
aware
that
this
princess
was
witty
and
beautiful
and
that
she
was
the
favourite
mistress
of
the
emperor
francis
the
first
i
heard
of
his
masquerade
and
leaving
my
hotel
at
the
same
time
i
followed
her
till
she
stopped
at
a
stall
and
then
going
up
to
her
and
addressing
her
as
one
would
any
other
maid
i
asked
if
that
pointing
at
the
false
princess
were
really
the
famous
princess
of
aremberg
certainly
she
replied
i
can
scarcely
believe
it
for
she
is
not
pretty
and
she
has
not
the
look
nor
the
manners
of
a
princess
perhaps
you
are
not
a
good
judge
of
princesses
i
have
seen
enough
of
them
anyhow
and
to
prove
that
i
am
a
good
judge
i
say
that
it
is
you
who
ought
to
be
the
princess
i
would
willingly
give
a
hundred
ducats
to
spend
the
night
with
you
a
hundred
ducats
what
would
you
do
if
i
were
to
take
you
at
your
word
try
me
i
lodge
at
the
same
hotel
as
you
and
if
yet
can
contrive
ways
and
means
i
will
give
you
the
money
in
advance
but
not
till
i
am
sure
of
my
prize
for
i
do
like
being
taken
in
very
good
say
not
a
word
to
anyone
but
try
to
speak
with
me
either
before
or
after
supper
if
you
are
brave
enough
to
face
certain
risks
we
will
spend
the
night
together
what
is
your
name
caroline
i
felt
certain
it
would
come
to
nothing
but
i
was
glad
to
have
amused
the
princess
and
to
have
let
her
know
that
i
appreciated
her
beauties
and
i
resolved
to
go
on
with
the
part
i
was
playing
about
i
began
a
promenade
near
the
princess
apartments
stopping
every
now
and
then
in
front
of
the
room
where
her
women
were
sitting
till
one
of
them
came
out
to
ask
me
if
i
wanted
anything
i
want
to
speak
for
a
moment
to
one
of
your
companions
to
whom
i
had
the
pleasure
of
talking
at
the
fair
you
mean
caroline
i
expect
yes
she
is
waiting
on
the
princess
but
she
will
be
out
in
half
an
hour
i
spent
this
half
hour
in
my
own
room
and
then
returned
to
dance
attendance
before
long
the
same
maid
to
whom
i
had
spoken
came
up
to
me
and
told
me
to
wait
in
a
closet
which
she
shewed
me
telling
me
that
caroline
would
be
there
before
long
i
went
into
the
closet
which
was
small
dark
and
uncomfortable
i
was
soon
joined
by
a
woman
this
time
i
was
sure
it
was
the
real
caroline
but
i
said
nothing
she
came
in
took
my
hand
and
told
me
that
if
i
would
wait
there
she
would
come
to
me
as
soon
as
her
mistress
was
in
bed
without
any
light
of
course
or
else
the
people
of
the
house
would
notice
it
and
i
should
not
like
that
i
can
not
do
anything
without
light
charming
caroline
and
besides
this
closet
is
not
a
very
nice
place
to
pass
five
or
six
hours
there
is
another
alternative
the
first
room
above
is
mine
i
shall
be
alone
and
i
swear
to
you
that
no
one
shall
come
in
come
up
and
make
me
happy
i
have
got
the
hundred
ducats
here
impossible
i
dare
not
go
upstairs
for
a
million
ducats
so
much
the
worse
for
you
as
i
am
not
going
to
stay
in
this
hole
which
has
only
a
chair
in
it
if
you
offer
me
a
million
and
a
half
farewell
sweet
caroline
wait
a
moment
let
me
go
out
first
the
sly
puss
went
out
quickly
enough
but
i
was
as
sharp
as
she
and
trod
on
the
tail
of
her
dress
so
that
she
could
not
shut
the
door
after
her
so
we
went
out
together
and
i
left
her
at
the
door
saying
good
night
caroline
you
see
it
was
no
use
i
went
to
bed
well
pleased
with
the
incident
the
princess
it
was
plain
had
intended
to
make
me
pass
the
night
in
the
hole
of
a
closet
as
a
punishment
for
having
dared
to
ask
the
mistress
of
an
emperor
to
sleep
with
me
for
a
hundred
crowns
two
days
later
as
i
was
buying
a
pair
of
lace
cuffs
the
princess
came
into
the
shop
with
count
zinzendorf
whom
i
had
known
at
paris
twelve
years
before
just
as
i
was
making
way
for
the
lady
the
count
recognized
me
and
asked
me
if
i
knew
anything
about
the
casanova
that
had
fought
the
duel
at
warsaw
alas
count
i
am
that
casanova
and
here
is
my
arm
still
in
a
sling
i
congratulate
you
my
dear
fellow
i
should
like
to
hear
about
it
with
these
words
he
introduced
me
to
the
princess
asking
her
if
she
had
heard
of
the
duel
yes
i
heard
something
about
it
in
the
papers
so
this
is
the
hero
of
the
tale
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
the
princess
spoke
with
great
kindness
but
with
the
cool
politeness
of
the
court
she
did
not
give
me
the
slightest
sign
of
recognition
and
of
course
i
imitated
her
in
her
reserve
i
visited
the
count
in
the
afternoon
and
he
begged
me
to
come
and
see
the
princess
who
would
be
delighted
to
hear
the
account
of
my
duel
from
my
own
lips
and
i
followed
him
to
her
apartment
with
pleasure
the
princess
listened
to
my
narrative
in
stately
sort
and
her
women
never
looked
at
me
she
went
away
the
day
after
and
the
story
went
no
farther
towards
the
end
of
the
fair
i
received
a
very
unexpected
visit
from
the
fair
madame
castelbajac
i
was
just
sitting
down
to
table
to
eat
a
dozen
larks
when
she
made
her
appearance
what
madam
you
here
yes
to
my
sorrow
i
have
been
here
for
the
last
three
weeks
and
have
seen
you
several
times
but
you
have
always
avoided
us
who
are
schwerin
and
myself
schwerin
is
here
is
he
yes
and
in
prison
on
account
of
a
forged
bill
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
what
they
will
do
to
the
poor
wretch
he
would
have
been
wise
to
have
fled
but
it
seems
as
if
he
wanted
to
get
hanged
and
you
have
been
with
him
ever
since
you
left
england
that
is
three
years
ago
exactly
our
occupation
is
robbing
cheating
and
escaping
from
one
land
to
another
never
was
a
woman
so
unhappy
as
i
for
how
much
is
the
forged
bill
for
three
hundred
crowns
do
a
generous
action
casanova
and
let
bygones
be
bygones
deliver
the
poor
wretch
from
the
gallows
and
me
from
death
for
if
he
is
hanged
i
shall
kill
myself
indeed
madam
he
may
hang
for
me
for
he
did
his
best
to
send
me
to
the
gallows
with
his
forged
bills
but
i
confess
i
pity
you
so
much
indeed
that
i
invite
you
to
come
to
dresden
with
me
the
day
after
and
i
promise
to
give
you
three
hundred
crowns
as
soon
as
schwerin
has
undergone
the
extreme
penalty
of
the
law
i
ca
understand
how
a
woman
like
you
can
have
fallen
in
love
with
a
man
that
has
neither
face
nor
talents
nor
wit
nor
fortune
for
all
that
he
has
to
boast
of
is
his
name
of
schwerin
i
confess
to
my
shame
that
i
never
loved
him
ever
since
the
other
rogue
castelbajac
who
by
the
way
was
never
married
to
me
made
me
know
him
i
have
only
lived
with
him
by
force
though
his
tears
and
his
despairs
have
excited
my
compassion
if
destiny
had
given
me
an
honest
man
in
his
stead
i
would
have
forsaken
him
long
ago
for
sooner
or
later
he
will
be
the
death
of
me
where
do
you
live
nowhere
i
have
been
turned
out
into
the
street
with
nothing
but
the
clothes
on
my
back
have
compassion
on
me
with
these
words
the
hapless
woman
threw
herself
at
my
knees
and
burst
into
tears
i
was
much
affected
the
waiter
of
the
inn
stood
staring
with
amazement
till
i
told
him
to
go
out
i
may
safely
say
that
this
woman
was
one
of
the
most
handsome
in
france
she
was
probably
about
years
old
she
had
been
the
wife
of
a
druggist
of
montpellier
and
had
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
let
castelbajac
seduce
her
at
london
her
beauty
had
produced
no
impression
on
me
my
heart
was
another
nevertheless
she
was
made
to
seduce
the
heart
of
man
i
raised
her
from
her
knees
and
said
i
felt
inclined
to
help
her
but
that
in
the
first
place
she
must
calm
herself
and
in
the
second
share
my
supper
the
waiter
brought
another
bed
and
put
it
in
my
room
without
receiving
any
orders
to
do
so
this
made
me
feel
inclined
to
laugh
the
appetite
with
which
the
poor
woman
ate
despite
her
sorrow
reminded
me
of
the
matron
of
ephesus
when
supper
was
over
i
gave
her
her
choice
she
might
either
stay
in
leipzig
and
fare
as
best
she
might
or
i
would
reclaim
her
effects
take
her
with
me
to
dresden
and
pay
her
a
hundred
gold
ducats
as
soon
as
i
could
be
certain
that
she
would
not
give
the
money
to
the
wretch
who
had
reduced
her
to
such
an
extremity
she
did
not
ask
much
time
for
reflection
she
said
that
it
would
be
no
good
for
her
to
stay
in
leipzig
for
she
could
do
nothing
for
the
wretched
schwerin
or
even
keep
herself
for
a
day
for
she
had
not
got
a
farthing
she
would
have
to
beg
or
to
become
a
prostitute
and
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
either
course
indeed
she
concluded
if
you
were
to
give
me
the
hundred
ducats
this
moment
and
i
used
them
to
free
schwerin
i
should
be
no
better
off
than
before
so
i
accept
your
generous
offer
thankfully
i
embraced
her
promised
to
get
back
what
her
landlord
had
seized
for
rent
and
then
begged
her
to
go
to
bed
as
she
was
in
need
of
rest
i
see
she
answered
that
either
out
of
liking
or
for
politeness
sake
you
will
ask
me
for
those
favours
which
i
should
be
only
too
happy
to
grant
but
if
i
allowed
that
it
would
be
a
bad
return
indeed
for
your
kindness
look
at
my
linen
and
behold
in
what
a
state
that
unhappy
wretch
has
left
me
i
saw
that
i
ran
the
risk
of
being
infected
again
and
thanked
her
for
warning
me
of
the
danger
i
ran
in
spite
of
her
faults
she
was
a
woman
of
feeling
and
had
an
excellent
heart
and
from
these
good
qualities
of
hers
proceeded
all
her
misfortunes
the
next
morning
i
arranged
for
the
redemption
of
her
effects
which
cost
me
sixty
crowns
of
saxony
and
in
the
afternoon
the
poor
woman
saw
herself
once
more
in
possession
of
her
belongings
which
she
had
thought
never
to
see
again
she
seemed
profoundly
grateful
and
deplored
her
state
which
hindered
her
from
proving
the
warmth
of
her
feelings
such
is
the
way
of
women
a
grateful
woman
has
only
one
way
of
shewing
her
gratitude
and
that
is
to
surrender
herself
without
reserve
a
man
is
different
but
we
are
differently
constituted
a
man
is
made
to
give
and
a
woman
to
receive
the
next
day
a
short
while
before
we
left
the
broker
i
had
employed
in
the
redemption
of
the
lady
effects
told
me
that
the
banker
whom
schwerin
had
cheated
was
going
to
send
an
express
to
berlin
to
enquire
whether
the
king
would
object
to
count
schwerin
being
proceeded
against
with
the
utmost
rigour
of
the
law
alas
cried
his
late
mistress
that
what
he
was
most
afraid
of
all
up
with
him
the
king
of
prussia
will
pay
his
debts
but
he
will
end
his
days
at
spandau
why
did
they
put
him
there
before
i
ever
knew
him
she
left
leipzig
with
me
and
our
appearance
at
dresden
caused
a
good
deal
of
surprise
she
was
not
a
mere
girl
like
maton
she
had
a
good
appearance
and
a
modest
yet
distinguished
manner
i
called
her
countess
blasin
and
introduced
her
to
my
mother
and
relations
and
put
her
in
my
best
room
i
summoned
the
doctor
who
had
treated
me
and
made
him
swear
not
to
disclose
the
countess
state
but
to
tell
everyone
that
he
came
to
see
me
i
took
her
to
the
theatre
and
it
was
my
humour
to
have
her
regarded
as
a
person
of
distinction
good
treatment
soon
restored
her
to
health
and
by
the
end
of
november
she
believed
herself
in
a
state
to
reward
me
for
my
kindness
the
wedding
was
a
secret
one
but
none
the
less
pleasant
and
as
if
by
way
of
wedding
present
the
next
day
i
heard
that
the
king
of
prussia
had
paid
schwerin
debts
and
had
had
him
brought
to
berlin
under
a
strong
escort
if
he
is
alive
the
rascal
is
at
spandau
to
this
day
the
time
had
come
for
me
to
pay
her
the
hundred
ducats
i
told
her
frankly
that
i
was
obliged
to
go
to
portugal
and
that
i
could
not
make
my
appearance
there
in
company
with
a
pretty
woman
without
failing
in
my
project
i
added
that
my
means
would
not
allow
me
to
pay
double
expenses
for
so
long
a
journey
she
had
received
too
many
proofs
of
my
love
to
think
for
a
moment
that
i
had
got
tired
of
her
and
wanted
to
be
on
with
some
other
woman
she
told
me
that
she
owed
everything
to
me
while
i
owed
nothing
to
her
and
that
all
she
asked
of
me
was
to
enable
her
to
return
to
montpellier
i
have
relations
there
said
she
who
will
be
glad
to
see
me
and
i
hope
that
my
husband
will
let
me
return
to
him
i
am
the
prodigal
son
and
i
hope
to
find
in
him
the
forgiving
father
i
told
her
i
would
do
my
utmost
to
send
her
home
in
safety
and
comfort
towards
the
middle
of
december
i
left
dresden
with
madame
blasin
my
purse
only
contained
four
hundred
ducats
for
i
had
had
a
run
of
bad
luck
at
play
and
the
journey
to
leipzig
had
cost
me
altogether
three
hundred
ducats
i
told
my
mistress
nothing
of
all
this
for
my
only
thought
was
how
to
please
her
we
stayed
a
short
while
at
prague
and
reached
vienna
on
christmas
day
we
put
up
at
the
red
bull
the
countess
blasin
who
had
been
transformed
into
a
milliner
in
one
room
and
i
in
another
so
that
we
might
pass
for
strangers
while
continuing
our
intimacy
the
next
morning
as
we
were
taking
coffee
together
two
individuals
came
into
the
room
and
asked
the
rude
question
who
are
you
madam
my
name
is
blasin
who
is
this
gentleman
you
had
better
ask
him
what
are
you
doing
at
vienna
taking
coffee
i
should
have
thought
you
could
have
seen
that
for
yourselves
if
the
gentleman
is
not
your
husband
you
will
leave
the
town
within
hours
the
gentleman
is
my
friend
and
not
my
husband
and
i
shall
leave
vienna
exactly
when
i
choose
unless
you
make
me
go
away
by
force
very
good
we
are
aware
sir
that
you
have
a
separate
room
but
that
makes
no
difference
thereupon
one
of
the
policemen
entered
my
room
i
following
him
what
do
you
want
here
said
i
i
am
looking
at
your
bed
and
i
can
see
you
have
not
slept
in
it
enough
the
devil
what
business
have
you
here
at
all
and
who
authorizes
such
disgraceful
proceedings
he
made
no
reply
but
returned
to
madame
blasin
room
where
they
both
ordered
her
to
leave
vienna
in
the
course
of
hours
and
then
they
both
left
us
dress
yourself
said
i
to
her
and
tell
the
french
ambassador
the
whole
story
tell
him
that
you
are
a
milliner
blasin
by
name
and
that
all
you
want
is
to
go
from
here
to
strasburg
and
from
there
to
montpellier
while
she
was
dressing
i
ordered
a
carriage
and
a
servant
to
be
in
attendance
she
returned
in
an
hour
time
and
said
the
ambassador
had
assured
her
that
she
would
be
left
alone
and
need
not
leave
vienna
till
she
thought
fit
i
took
her
to
mass
in
triumph
and
then
as
the
weather
was
bad
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
eating
and
drinking
and
sitting
by
the
fire
at
eight
in
the
evening
the
landlord
came
up
and
said
very
politely
that
he
had
been
ordered
by
the
police
to
give
the
lady
a
room
at
some
distance
from
mine
and
that
he
was
obliged
to
obey
i
am
quite
ready
to
change
my
room
said
madame
blasin
with
a
smile
is
the
lady
to
sup
alone
i
asked
i
have
received
no
instructions
on
that
point
then
i
will
sup
with
her
and
i
hope
you
will
treat
us
well
you
shall
be
well
served
sir
in
spite
of
the
detestable
and
tyrannical
police
we
spent
the
last
four
days
and
nights
together
in
the
closest
intimacy
when
she
left
i
wanted
her
to
take
fifty
louis
but
she
would
only
have
thirty
saying
that
she
could
travel
to
montpellier
on
that
sum
and
have
money
in
her
pocket
when
she
got
there
our
parting
was
an
affecting
one
she
wrote
to
me
from
strasburg
and
we
shall
hear
of
her
again
when
i
describe
my
visit
to
montpellier
the
first
day
of
the
year
i
took
an
apartment
in
the
house
of
a
certain
schroder
and
i
took
letters
of
introduction
to
madame
de
salmor
and
madame
de
stahremberg
i
then
called
on
the
elder
calsabigi
who
was
in
the
service
of
prince
kaunitz
this
calsabigi
whose
whole
body
was
one
mass
of
eruption
always
worked
in
bed
and
the
minister
his
master
went
to
see
him
almost
every
day
i
went
constantly
to
the
theatre
where
madame
vestris
was
dancing
on
january
the
or
i
saw
the
empress
dowager
come
to
the
theatre
dressed
in
black
she
was
received
with
applause
as
this
was
the
first
appearance
she
had
made
since
the
death
of
her
husband
at
vienna
i
met
the
comte
de
la
perouse
who
was
trying
to
induce
the
empress
to
give
him
half
a
million
of
florins
which
charles
vi
owed
his
father
through
him
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
spaniard
las
casas
a
man
of
intelligence
and
what
is
a
rare
thing
in
a
spaniard
free
from
prejudices
i
also
met
at
the
count
house
the
venetian
uccelli
with
whom
i
had
been
at
cyprian
college
at
muran
he
was
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
secretary
to
the
ambassador
polo
renieri
this
gentleman
had
a
great
esteem
for
me
but
my
affair
with
the
state
inquisitors
prevented
him
from
receiving
me
my
friend
campioni
arrived
at
this
date
from
warsaw
he
had
passed
through
cracovia
i
accommodated
him
in
my
apartment
with
great
pleasure
he
had
an
engagement
at
london
but
to
my
great
delight
he
was
able
to
spend
a
couple
of
months
with
me
prince
charles
of
courland
who
had
been
at
venice
and
had
been
well
received
by
de
bragadin
and
my
other
friends
had
been
in
vienna
and
had
left
it
a
fortnight
before
my
arrival
to
return
to
venice
prince
charles
wrote
to
tell
me
that
there
was
no
bounds
to
the
care
and
kindness
of
my
venetian
friends
and
that
he
would
be
grateful
to
me
for
all
his
days
i
lived
very
quietly
at
vienna
my
health
was
good
and
i
thought
of
nothing
but
my
journey
to
portugal
which
i
intended
to
take
place
in
the
spring
i
saw
no
company
of
any
kind
whether
good
or
ill
i
often
called
on
calsabigi
who
made
a
parade
of
his
atheism
and
slandered
my
friend
metastasio
who
despised
him
calsabigi
knew
it
and
laughed
at
him
he
was
a
profound
politician
and
the
right
hand
of
prince
kaunitz
one
day
after
dinner
as
i
was
sitting
at
table
with
my
friend
campioni
a
pretty
little
girl
between
twelve
and
thirteen
as
i
should
imagine
came
into
my
room
with
mingled
boldness
and
fear
and
made
me
a
low
bow
i
asked
her
what
she
wanted
and
she
replied
in
latin
verse
to
the
effect
that
her
mother
was
in
the
next
room
and
that
if
i
liked
she
would
come
in
i
replied
in
latin
prose
that
i
did
not
care
about
seeing
her
mother
telling
her
my
reasons
with
great
plainness
she
replied
with
four
latin
lines
but
as
they
were
not
to
the
point
i
could
see
that
she
had
learnt
them
by
heart
and
repeated
them
like
a
parrot
she
went
in
latin
verse
to
tell
me
that
her
mother
must
come
in
or
else
the
authorities
might
think
i
was
abusing
her
this
last
phrase
was
uttered
with
all
the
directness
of
the
latin
style
it
made
me
burst
out
laughing
and
i
felt
inclined
to
explain
to
her
what
she
had
said
in
her
own
language
the
little
slut
told
me
she
was
a
venetian
and
this
putting
me
at
my
ease
i
told
her
that
the
authorities
would
never
suspect
her
of
doing
such
a
thing
as
she
was
too
young
at
this
the
girl
seemed
to
reflect
a
moment
and
then
recited
some
verses
from
the
priapeia
to
the
effect
that
unripe
fruit
is
often
more
piquant
than
that
which
is
ripe
this
was
enough
to
set
me
on
fire
and
campioni
seeing
that
he
was
not
wanted
went
back
to
his
room
i
drew
her
gently
to
me
and
asked
her
if
her
father
was
at
vienna
she
said
yes
and
instead
of
repulsing
my
caresses
she
proceeded
to
accompany
my
actions
with
the
recital
of
erotic
verses
i
sent
her
away
with
a
fee
of
two
ducats
but
before
she
went
she
gave
me
her
address
written
in
german
with
four
latin
verses
beneath
stating
that
her
bedfellow
would
find
her
either
hebe
or
ganymede
according
to
his
liking
i
could
not
help
admiring
the
ingenuity
of
her
father
who
thus
contrived
to
make
a
living
out
of
his
daughters
she
was
a
pretty
girl
enough
but
at
vienna
pretty
girls
are
so
common
that
they
often
have
to
starve
in
spite
of
their
charms
the
latin
verses
had
been
thrown
in
as
an
attraction
in
this
case
but
i
did
not
think
she
would
find
it
very
remunerative
in
vienna
next
evening
my
evil
genius
made
me
go
and
seek
her
out
at
the
address
she
had
given
me
although
i
was
years
old
in
spite
of
the
experience
i
had
had
i
was
so
foolish
as
to
go
alone
the
girl
saw
me
coming
from
the
window
and
guessing
that
i
was
looking
for
her
she
came
down
and
shewed
me
in
i
went
in
i
went
upstairs
and
when
i
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
the
wretch
pocchini
my
blood
froze
in
my
veins
a
feeling
of
false
shame
prevented
my
retracing
my
steps
as
it
might
have
looked
as
if
i
had
been
afraid
in
the
same
room
were
his
pretended
wife
catina
two
assassins
and
the
i
saw
that
this
was
not
a
laughing
matter
so
i
dissembled
to
the
best
of
my
ability
and
made
up
my
mind
to
leave
the
place
in
five
minutes
time
pocchini
swearing
and
blaspheming
began
to
reproach
me
with
the
manner
in
which
i
had
treated
him
in
england
and
said
that
his
time
had
come
and
that
my
life
was
in
his
hands
one
of
the
two
sclavs
broke
in
and
said
we
must
make
friends
and
so
made
me
sit
down
opened
a
bottle
and
said
we
must
drink
together
i
tried
to
put
as
good
a
face
upon
it
as
i
could
but
i
begged
to
be
excused
on
which
pocchini
swore
that
i
was
afraid
of
having
to
pay
for
the
bottle
of
wine
you
are
mistaken
said
i
i
am
quite
ready
to
pay
i
put
my
hand
in
my
pocket
to
take
out
a
ducat
without
drawing
out
my
purse
but
the
sclav
told
me
i
need
not
be
afraid
as
i
was
amongst
honest
people
again
shame
made
me
yield
and
as
i
had
some
difficulty
in
extracting
my
purse
the
sclav
kindly
did
it
for
me
pocchini
immediately
snatched
it
from
his
hands
and
said
he
should
keep
it
as
part
compensation
for
all
i
had
made
him
endure
i
saw
that
it
was
a
concerted
scheme
and
said
with
a
smile
that
he
could
do
as
he
liked
and
so
i
rose
to
leave
them
the
sclav
said
we
must
embrace
each
other
and
on
my
declaring
that
to
be
unnecessary
he
and
his
comrade
drew
their
sabres
and
i
thought
myself
undone
without
more
ado
i
hastened
to
embrace
them
to
my
astonishment
they
let
me
go
and
i
went
home
in
a
grievous
state
and
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
went
to
bed
