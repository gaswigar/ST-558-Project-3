the

ajar
i
one
week
only
one
week
this
of
february
i
have
been
sitting
here
in
the
dark
and
thinking
about
it
till
it
seems
so
horribly
long
and
so
horribly
short
it
has
been
such
a
week
to
live
through
and
it
is
such
a
small
part
of
the
weeks
that
must
be
lived
through
that
i
could
think
no
longer
but
lighted
my
lamp
and
opened
my
desk
to
find
something
to
do
i
was
tossing
my
paper
about
only
my
own
the
packages
in
the
yellow
envelopes
i
have
not
been
quite
brave
enough
to
open
yet
when
i
came
across
this
poor
little
book
in
which
i
used
to
keep
memoranda
of
the
weather
and
my
lovers
when
i
was
a
i
turned
the
leaves
smiling
to
see
how
many
blank
pages
were
left
and
took
up
my
pen
and
now
i
am
not
smiling
any
more
if
it
had
not
come
exactly
as
it
did
it
seems
to
me
as
if
i
could
bear
it
better
they
tell
me
that
it
should
not
have
been
such
a
shock
your
brother
had
been
in
the
army
so
long
that
you
should
have
been
prepared
for
anything
everybody
knows
by
what
a
hair
a
soldier
s
life
is
always
hanging
and
a
great
deal
more
that
i
am
afraid
i
have
not
listened
to
i
suppose
it
is
all
true
but
that
never
makes
it
any
easier
the
house
feels
like
a
prison
i
walk
up
and
down
and
wonder
that
i
ever
called
it
home
something
is
the
matter
with
the
sunsets
they
come
and
go
and
i
do
not
notice
them
something
ails
the
voices
of
the
children
snowballing
down
the
street
all
the
music
has
gone
out
of
them
and
they
hurt
me
like
knives
the
harmless
happy
children
and
roy
loved
the
little
children
why
it
seems
to
me
as
if
the
world
were
spinning
around
in
the
light
and
wind
and
laughter
and
god
just
stretched
down
his
hand
one
morning
and
put
it
out
it
was
such
a
dear
pleasant
world
to
be
put
out
it
was
never
dearer
or
more
pleasant
than
it
was
on
that
morning
i
had
not
been
as
happy
for
weeks
i
came
up
from
the
singing
to
myself
his
letter
was
so
bright
and
full
of
mischief
i
had
not
had
one
like
it
all
the
winter
i
have
laid
it
away
by
itself
filled
with
his
jokes
and
pet
names
mamie
or
queen
mamie
every
other
line
and
signed
until
next
time
your
happy
i
wonder
if
all
brothers
and
sisters
keep
up
the
as
we
did
i
wonder
if
i
shall
ever
become
used
to
living
without
them
i
read
the
letter
over
a
great
many
times
and
stopped
to
tell
mrs
bland
the
news
in
it
and
wondered
what
had
kept
it
so
long
on
the
way
and
wondered
if
it
could
be
true
that
he
would
have
a
furlough
in
may
it
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
if
i
had
been
fourteen
instead
of
i
should
have
jumped
up
and
down
and
clapped
my
hands
there
in
the
street
the
sky
was
so
bright
that
i
could
scarcely
turn
up
my
eyes
to
look
at
it
the
sunshine
was
shivered
into
little
lances
all
over
the
glaring
white
crust
there
was
a
chirping
and
pecking
on
the
as
i
came
in
i
went
up
and
opened
my
window
sat
down
by
it
and
drew
a
long
breath
and
began
to
count
the
days
till
may
i
must
have
sat
there
as
much
as
half
an
hour
i
was
so
happy
counting
the
days
that
i
did
not
hear
the
front
gate
and
when
i
looked
down
a
man
stood
there
a
great
rough
man
who
shouted
up
that
he
was
in
a
hurry
and
wanted
cents
for
a
telegram
that
he
had
brought
over
from
east
homer
i
believe
i
went
down
and
paid
him
sent
him
away
came
up
here
and
locked
the
door
before
i
read
it
phœbe
found
me
here
at
if
i
could
have
gone
to
him
could
have
busied
myself
with
packing
and
journeying
could
have
been
forced
to
think
and
plan
could
have
had
the
shadow
of
a
hope
of
one
more
look
one
word
i
suppose
i
should
have
taken
it
differently
those
two
words
shot
dead
shut
me
up
and
walled
me
in
as
i
think
people
must
feel
shut
up
and
walled
in
in
hell
i
write
the
words
most
solemnly
for
i
know
that
there
has
been
hell
in
my
heart
it
is
all
over
now
he
came
back
and
they
brought
him
up
the
steps
and
i
listened
to
their
feet
so
many
feet
he
used
to
come
bounding
in
they
let
me
see
him
for
a
minute
and
there
was
a
funeral
and
mrs
bland
came
over
and
she
and
phœbe
attended
to
everything
i
suppose
i
did
not
notice
nor
think
till
we
had
left
him
out
there
in
the
cold
and
had
come
back
the
windows
of
his
room
were
opened
and
the
bitter
wind
swept
in
the
house
was
still
and
damp
nobody
was
there
to
welcome
me
nobody
would
ever
be
poor
old
phœbe
i
had
forgotten
her
she
was
waiting
at
the
kitchen
window
in
her
black
bonnet
she
took
off
my
things
and
made
me
a
cup
of
tea
and
kept
at
work
near
me
for
a
little
while
wiping
her
eyes
she
came
in
just
now
when
i
had
left
my
unfinished
sentence
to
dry
sitting
here
with
my
face
in
my
hands
laws
now
miss
mary
my
dear
this
won
t
never
do
a
rebellin
agin
providence
and
singein
your
hair
on
the
lamp
chimney
this
way
the
fire
s
goin
beautiful
and
the
salmon
is
toasted
to
a
brown
put
away
them
papers
and
come
right
along
ii
february
who
originated
that
most
exquisite
of
inquisitions
the
condolence
system
a
solid
blow
has
in
itself
the
elements
of
its
rebound
it
arouses
the
antagonism
of
the
life
on
which
it
falls
its
relief
is
the
relief
of
a
combat
but
a
hundred
little
needles
pricking
at
us
what
is
to
be
done
with
them
the
hands
hang
down
the
knees
are
feeble
we
can
not
so
much
as
gasp
because
they
little
needles
i
know
that
there
are
those
who
like
these
calls
but
why
in
the
name
of
all
sweet
pity
must
we
endure
them
without
respect
of
persons
as
we
would
endure
a
wedding
reception
or
make
a
perhaps
i
write
excitedly
and
hardly
i
feel
excited
and
hard
i
am
sure
i
do
not
mean
to
be
ungrateful
for
real
sorrowful
sympathy
however
imperfectly
it
may
be
shown
or
that
near
friends
if
one
has
them
can
not
give
in
such
a
time
as
this
actual
strength
even
if
they
fail
of
comfort
by
look
and
tone
and
love
but
it
is
not
near
friends
who
are
apt
to
wound
nor
real
sympathy
which
sharpens
the
worst
of
the
needles
it
is
the
fact
that
all
your
chance
acquaintances
feel
called
upon
to
bring
their
curious
eyes
and
jarring
words
right
into
the
silence
of
your
first
astonishment
taking
you
in
a
round
of
morning
calls
with
kid
gloves
and
parasol
and
the
liberty
to
turn
your
heart
about
and
cut
into
it
at
pleasure
you
may
quiver
at
every
touch
but
there
is
no
escape
because
it
is
the
for
instance
meta
tripp
came
in
this
afternoon
i
have
refused
myself
to
everybody
but
mrs
bland
before
but
meta
caught
me
in
the
parlor
and
there
was
no
escape
she
had
come
it
was
plain
enough
because
she
must
and
she
had
come
early
because
she
too
having
lost
a
brother
in
the
war
she
was
expected
to
be
very
sorry
for
me
very
likely
she
was
and
very
likely
she
did
the
best
she
knew
how
but
she
was
not
as
uncomfortable
as
i
but
as
uncomfortable
as
she
could
be
and
was
evidently
glad
when
it
was
over
she
observed
as
she
went
out
that
i
shouldn
t
feel
so
sad
by
and
by
she
felt
very
sad
at
first
when
jack
died
but
everybody
got
over
that
after
a
time
the
girls
were
going
to
sew
for
the
fair
next
week
at
quirk
s
and
she
hoped
i
would
exert
myself
and
come
ah
well
first
learn
to
love
one
living
man
then
mayst
thou
think
upon
the
it
is
not
that
the
child
is
to
be
blamed
for
not
knowing
enough
to
stay
away
but
her
coming
here
has
made
me
wonder
whether
i
am
different
from
other
women
why
roy
was
so
much
more
to
me
than
many
brothers
are
to
many
sisters
i
think
it
must
be
that
there
never
another
like
roy
then
we
have
lived
together
so
long
we
two
alone
since
father
died
that
he
had
grown
to
me
heart
of
my
heart
and
life
of
my
life
it
did
not
seem
as
if
he
be
taken
and
i
be
left
besides
i
suppose
most
young
women
of
my
age
have
their
dreams
and
a
future
probable
or
possible
which
makes
the
very
incompleteness
of
life
sweet
because
of
the
symmetry
which
is
waiting
somewhere
but
that
was
settled
so
long
ago
for
me
that
it
makes
it
very
different
roy
was
all
there
was
february
death
and
heaven
could
not
seem
very
different
to
a
pagan
from
what
they
seem
to
me
i
say
this
deliberately
it
has
been
deliberately
forced
upon
me
that
of
which
i
had
a
faint
consciousness
in
the
first
shock
takes
shape
now
i
do
not
see
how
one
with
such
thoughts
in
her
heart
as
i
have
had
can
possibly
be
regenerate
or
stand
any
chance
of
ever
becoming
one
of
the
and
here
i
am
what
i
have
been
for
six
years
a
member
of
an
evangelical
church
in
good
and
regular
standing
the
bare
blank
sense
of
physical
repulsion
from
death
which
was
all
the
idea
i
had
of
anything
when
they
first
brought
him
home
has
not
gone
yet
it
is
horrible
it
was
cruel
roy
all
i
had
in
the
wide
world
roy
with
the
flash
in
his
eyes
with
his
smile
that
lighted
the
house
all
up
with
his
pretty
soft
hair
that
i
used
to
curl
and
kiss
about
my
finger
his
bounding
step
his
strong
arms
that
folded
me
in
and
cared
for
me
roy
snatched
away
in
an
instant
by
a
dreadful
god
and
laid
out
there
in
the
wet
and
snow
in
the
hideous
wet
and
snow
never
to
kiss
him
never
to
see
him
any
more
he
was
a
good
boy
roy
was
a
good
boy
he
must
have
gone
to
heaven
but
i
know
nothing
about
heaven
it
is
very
far
off
in
my
best
and
happiest
days
i
never
liked
to
think
of
it
if
i
were
to
go
there
it
could
do
me
no
good
for
i
should
not
see
roy
or
if
by
chance
i
should
see
him
standing
up
among
the
grand
white
angels
he
would
not
be
the
old
dear
roy
i
should
grow
so
tired
of
singing
should
long
and
fret
for
one
little
talk
for
i
never
said
good
by
and
i
will
stop
this
a
scrap
from
the
german
of
bürger
which
i
came
across
shall
be
copied
here
be
calm
my
child
forget
thy
woe
and
think
of
god
and
heaven
christ
thy
redeemer
hath
to
thee
himself
for
comfort
given
o
mother
mother
what
is
heaven
o
mother
what
is
hell
to
be
with
wilhelm
that
s
my
heaven
without
him
that
s
my
february
miss
meta
tripp
in
the
ignorance
of
her
little
silly
heart
has
done
me
a
great
mischief
phœbe
prepared
me
for
it
by
observing
when
she
came
up
yesterday
to
dust
my
room
that
folks
was
all
sayin
that
mary
cabot
homer
is
not
an
aristocratic
town
and
phœbe
doffs
and
dons
my
title
at
her
own
sweet
will
that
mary
cabot
was
dreadful
low
sence
royal
died
and
hadn
t
ought
to
stay
shut
up
by
herself
day
in
and
day
out
it
was
behaving
to
the
will
of
providence
and
very
bad
for
her
health
moreover
mrs
bland
who
called
this
morning
with
her
three
babies
she
never
is
able
to
stir
out
of
the
house
without
those
children
poor
thing
lingered
awkwardly
on
the
as
she
went
away
and
hoped
that
mary
my
dear
wouldn
t
take
it
unkindly
but
she
did
wish
that
i
would
exert
myself
more
to
see
my
friends
and
receive
comfort
in
my
affliction
she
didn
t
want
to
interfere
or
bother
me
or
but
people
would
talk
and
my
good
little
minister
s
wife
broke
down
all
in
a
blush
at
this
point
in
her
porochial
duties
i
more
than
suspect
that
her
husband
had
a
hand
in
the
matter
so
i
took
pity
on
her
embarrassment
and
said
smiling
that
i
would
think
about
it
i
see
just
how
the
leaven
has
spread
miss
meta
a
little
overwhelmed
and
a
good
deal
mystified
by
her
call
here
pronounces
poor
mary
cabot
sad
she
wouldn
t
talk
about
royal
and
you
couldn
t
persuade
her
to
come
to
the
fair
and
she
was
so
why
it
was
dreadful
therefore
homer
has
made
up
its
mind
that
i
shall
become
resigned
in
an
arithmetical
manner
and
comforted
according
to
the
rule
of
three
i
wish
i
could
go
away
i
wish
i
could
go
away
and
creep
into
the
ground
and
die
if
nobody
need
ever
speak
any
more
words
to
me
if
anybody
only
knew
to
say
little
mrs
bland
has
been
very
kind
and
i
thank
her
with
all
my
heart
but
she
does
not
know
she
does
not
understand
her
happy
heart
is
bound
up
in
her
little
live
children
she
never
laid
anybody
away
under
the
snow
without
a
chance
to
say
good
by
as
for
the
minister
he
came
of
course
as
it
was
proper
that
he
should
before
the
funeral
and
once
after
he
is
a
very
good
man
but
i
am
afraid
of
him
and
i
am
glad
that
he
has
not
come
again
night
i
can
only
repeat
and
what
i
wrote
this
noon
if
anybody
knew
to
say
just
after
supper
i
heard
the
and
looking
out
of
the
window
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
deacon
quirk
s
old
drab
felt
hat
on
the
upper
step
my
heart
sank
but
there
was
no
help
for
me
i
waited
for
phœbe
to
bring
up
his
name
desperately
listening
to
her
heavy
steps
and
letting
her
knock
three
times
before
i
answered
i
confess
to
having
taken
my
hair
down
twice
washed
my
hands
to
a
most
unnecessary
extent
and
been
a
long
time
brushing
my
dress
also
to
forgetting
my
handkerchief
and
having
to
go
back
for
it
after
i
was
down
stairs
deacon
quirk
looked
tired
of
waiting
i
hope
he
was
o
what
an
thing
to
say
what
is
coming
over
me
what
would
roy
think
what
could
he
good
evening
mary
said
the
deacon
severely
when
i
went
in
probably
he
did
not
mean
to
speak
severely
but
the
truth
is
i
think
he
was
a
little
vexed
that
i
had
kept
him
waiting
i
said
good
evening
and
apologized
for
my
delay
and
sat
down
as
far
from
him
as
i
conveniently
could
there
was
an
awful
silence
i
came
in
this
evening
said
the
deacon
breaking
it
with
a
cough
i
came
hem
to
confer
with
you
i
looked
up
i
thought
somebody
had
ought
to
come
continued
the
deacon
to
confer
with
you
as
a
christian
brother
on
your
spiritooal
i
opened
my
eyes
to
confer
with
you
on
your
spiritooal
condition
repeated
my
visitor
i
understand
that
you
have
had
some
unfortoonate
exercises
of
mind
under
your
affliction
and
i
observed
that
you
absented
yourself
from
the
communion
table
last
i
intentionally
he
seemed
to
expect
me
to
say
something
more
and
seeing
that
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
answered
i
did
not
feel
fit
to
go
i
should
not
have
dared
to
go
god
does
not
seem
to
me
just
now
what
he
used
to
he
has
dealt
very
bitterly
with
me
but
however
wicked
i
may
be
i
will
not
mock
him
i
think
deacon
quirk
that
i
did
right
to
stay
well
said
the
deacon
twirling
his
hat
with
a
puzzled
look
perhaps
you
did
but
i
don
t
see
the
excuse
for
any
such
feelings
as
would
make
it
necessary
i
think
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
mary
that
i
am
sorry
to
see
you
in
such
a
rebellious
state
of
i
made
no
reply
afflictions
come
from
god
he
observed
looking
at
me
as
impressively
as
if
he
supposed
that
i
had
never
heard
the
statement
before
afflictions
come
from
god
and
however
afflictin
or
however
crushin
they
may
be
it
is
our
duty
to
submit
to
them
glory
in
triboolation
paul
says
glory
in
i
continued
silent
i
sympathize
with
you
in
this
sad
dispensation
he
proceeded
of
course
you
was
very
fond
of
royal
it
s
natural
you
should
be
quite
natural
he
stopped
perplexed
i
suppose
by
something
in
my
face
yes
it
s
very
natural
poor
human
nature
sets
a
great
deal
by
earthly
props
and
affections
but
it
s
your
duty
as
a
christian
and
a
to
be
i
tapped
the
floor
with
my
foot
i
began
to
think
that
i
could
not
bear
much
more
to
be
resigned
my
dear
young
friend
to
say
abba
and
pray
that
the
will
of
the
lord
be
deacon
quirk
said
i
i
am
resigned
i
pray
the
dear
lord
with
all
my
heart
to
make
me
so
but
i
will
not
say
that
i
am
until
i
am
if
ever
that
time
comes
as
for
those
words
about
the
lord
s
will
i
would
no
more
take
them
on
my
lips
than
i
would
blasphemy
unless
i
could
speak
them
honestly
and
that
i
can
not
do
we
had
better
talk
of
something
else
now
had
we
not
deacon
quirk
looked
at
me
it
struck
me
that
he
would
look
very
much
so
at
a
mormon
or
a
hottentot
and
i
wondered
whether
he
were
going
to
excommunicate
me
on
the
spot
as
soon
as
he
began
to
speak
however
i
saw
that
he
was
only
bewildered
honestly
bewildered
and
honestly
shocked
i
do
not
doubt
that
i
had
said
bewildering
and
shocking
things
my
friend
he
said
solemnly
i
shall
pray
for
you
and
leave
you
in
the
hands
of
god
your
brother
whom
he
has
removed
from
this
earthly
life
for
his
own
wise
we
will
not
talk
any
more
about
roy
if
you
please
i
interrupted
is
happy
and
hem
i
hope
so
he
replied
moving
uneasily
in
his
chair
i
believe
he
never
made
a
profession
of
religion
but
there
is
no
limit
to
the
mercy
of
god
it
is
very
unsafe
for
the
young
to
think
that
they
can
rely
on
a
repentance
but
our
god
is
a
god
and
royal
s
mother
was
a
pious
woman
if
you
can
not
say
with
certainty
that
he
is
numbered
among
the
redeemed
you
are
justified
perhaps
in
hoping
i
turned
sharply
on
him
but
words
died
on
my
lips
how
could
i
tell
the
man
of
that
short
dear
letter
that
came
to
me
in
december
that
roy
s
was
no
repentance
but
the
quiet
natural
growth
of
a
life
that
had
always
been
the
life
of
the
pure
in
heart
of
his
manly
beliefs
and
unselfish
motives
of
that
dawning
sense
of
friendship
with
christ
of
which
he
used
to
speak
so
modestly
dreading
lest
he
should
not
be
honest
with
himself
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
call
myself
a
christian
he
wrote
i
learned
the
words
by
and
i
shall
make
no
profession
to
be
such
till
i
am
sure
of
it
but
my
life
has
not
seemed
to
me
for
a
long
time
to
be
my
own
bought
with
a
price
just
expresses
it
i
can
point
to
no
time
at
which
i
was
conscious
by
any
revolution
of
feeling
of
experiencing
a
change
of
heart
but
it
seems
to
me
that
a
man
s
heart
might
be
changed
for
all
that
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
be
able
to
watch
every
footprint
of
god
the
is
all
that
concerns
us
to
see
that
we
follow
it
and
him
this
i
am
sure
of
and
knocking
about
in
this
army
life
only
convinces
me
of
what
i
felt
in
a
certain
way
before
that
it
is
the
only
way
and
he
the
only
guide
but
how
could
i
say
anything
of
this
to
deacon
quirk
this
my
sealed
and
sacred
treasure
of
all
that
roy
left
me
the
dearest
at
any
rate
i
did
not
it
seemed
both
obstinate
and
cruel
in
him
to
come
there
and
say
what
he
had
been
saying
he
might
have
known
that
i
would
not
say
that
roy
had
gone
to
heaven
if
why
if
there
had
been
the
breath
of
a
doubt
it
is
a
possibility
of
which
i
can
not
rationally
conceive
but
i
suppose
that
his
name
would
never
have
passed
my
lips
so
i
turned
away
from
deacon
quirk
and
shut
my
mouth
and
waited
for
him
to
finish
whether
the
idea
began
to
struggle
into
his
mind
that
he
not
have
been
making
a
very
comforting
remark
i
can
not
say
but
he
started
very
soon
to
go
supposing
you
are
right
and
royal
was
saved
at
the
eleventh
hour
he
said
at
parting
with
one
of
his
stolid
efforts
to
be
consolatory
that
are
worse
than
his
rebukes
if
he
is
singing
the
song
of
moses
and
the
lamb
he
pointed
with
his
big
dingy
thumb
at
the
ceiling
doesn
t
rebel
against
the
doings
of
providence
all
affections
are
subdued
to
god
merged
as
you
might
say
merged
in
worshipping
before
the
great
white
throne
he
doesn
t
think
this
miser
ble
earthly
spere
of
any
importance
compared
with
that
eternal
and
exceeding
weight
of
glory
in
the
appropriate
words
of
the
poet
o
not
to
one
created
thing
shall
our
embrace
be
given
but
all
our
joy
shall
be
in
god
for
only
god
is
those
are
very
spiritooal
and
scripteral
lines
and
it
s
very
proper
to
reflect
how
true
they
i
saw
him
go
out
and
came
up
here
and
locked
myself
in
and
have
been
walking
round
and
round
the
room
i
must
have
walked
a
good
while
for
i
feel
as
weak
as
a
baby
can
the
man
in
any
state
of
existence
be
made
to
comprehend
that
he
has
been
holding
me
on
the
rack
this
whole
evening
yet
he
came
under
a
strict
sense
of
duty
and
in
the
kindness
of
all
the
heart
he
has
i
know
or
i
ought
to
know
that
he
is
a
good
man
far
better
in
the
sight
of
god
i
do
not
doubt
than
i
am
but
it
hurts
it
cuts
that
thing
which
he
said
as
he
went
out
because
i
suppose
it
must
be
true
because
it
seems
to
me
greater
than
i
can
bear
to
have
it
true
roy
away
in
that
dreadful
heaven
can
have
no
thought
of
me
can
not
remember
how
i
loved
him
how
he
left
me
all
alone
the
singing
and
the
worshipping
must
take
up
all
his
time
god
wants
it
all
he
is
a
jealous
i
am
nothing
any
more
to
roy
march
and
once
i
was
much
very
much
to
him
his
mamie
his
poor
queen
mamie
dearer
he
used
to
say
than
all
the
world
to
him
i
don
t
see
how
he
can
like
it
so
well
up
there
as
to
forget
her
though
roy
was
a
very
good
boy
but
this
poor
wicked
little
mamie
why
i
fall
to
pitying
her
as
if
she
were
some
one
else
and
wish
that
some
one
would
cry
over
her
a
little
i
can
t
cry
roy
used
to
say
a
thing
i
have
not
the
words
but
it
was
like
this
that
one
must
be
either
very
young
or
very
ungenerous
if
one
could
find
time
to
pity
one
s
self
i
have
lain
for
two
nights
with
my
eyes
open
all
night
long
i
thought
that
perhaps
i
might
see
him
i
have
been
praying
for
a
touch
a
sign
only
for
something
to
break
the
silence
into
which
he
has
gone
but
there
is
no
answer
none
the
light
burns
blue
and
i
see
at
last
that
it
is
morning
and
go
down
stairs
alone
and
so
the
day
begins
something
of
browning
s
has
been
keeping
a
dull
mechanical
time
in
my
brain
all
day
god
keeps
a
niche
in
heaven
to
hold
our
idols
albeit
he
brake
them
to
our
faces
and
denied
that
our
close
kisses
should
impair
their
but
why
must
he
take
them
and
why
should
he
keep
them
there
shall
we
ever
see
them
framed
in
their
glorious
gloom
will
he
let
us
touch
them
or
must
we
stand
like
a
poor
worshipper
at
a
cathedral
looking
up
at
his
pictured
saint
afar
off
upon
the
other
side
has
everything
stopped
just
here
our
talks
together
in
the
twilight
our
planning
and
hoping
and
dreaming
together
our
walks
and
rides
and
laughing
our
reading
and
singing
and
loving
these
then
are
all
gone
out
forever
god
forgive
the
words
but
heaven
will
never
be
heaven
to
me
without
them
march
perhaps
i
had
better
not
write
any
more
here
after
this
on
looking
over
the
leaves
i
see
that
the
little
green
book
has
become
an
outlet
for
the
shallower
part
of
pain
meta
tripp
and
deacon
quirk
gossip
and
sympathy
that
have
buzzed
into
my
trouble
and
annoyed
me
like
wasps
we
are
apt
to
make
more
fuss
over
a
than
a
just
that
proportion
of
suffering
which
alone
can
ever
be
put
into
words
the
surface
i
begin
to
understand
what
i
never
understood
till
now
what
people
mean
by
the
luxury
of
grief
no
i
am
sure
that
i
never
understood
it
because
my
pride
suffered
as
much
as
any
part
of
me
in
that
other
time
i
would
no
more
have
spent
two
consecutive
hours
drifting
at
the
mercy
of
my
thoughts
than
i
would
have
put
my
hand
into
the
furnace
fire
the
right
to
mourn
makes
everything
different
then
as
to
mother
i
was
very
young
when
she
died
and
father
though
i
loved
him
was
never
to
me
what
roy
has
been
this
luxury
of
grief
like
all
luxuries
is
pleasurable
though
as
i
was
saying
it
is
only
the
shallow
part
of
one
s
heart
i
imagine
that
the
deepest
hearts
have
their
shallows
which
can
be
filled
by
it
still
it
brings
a
shallow
relief
let
it
be
confessed
to
this
honest
book
that
driven
to
it
by
desperation
i
found
in
it
a
wretched
sort
of
content
being
a
little
stronger
now
physically
i
shall
try
to
be
a
little
braver
it
will
do
no
harm
to
try
so
i
seem
to
see
that
it
was
the
content
of
poison
poured
between
shipwrecked
lips
at
any
rate
i
mean
to
put
the
book
away
and
lock
it
up
roy
used
to
say
that
he
did
not
believe
in
journals
i
begin
to
see
why
iii
march
i
have
taken
out
my
book
and
am
going
to
write
again
but
there
is
an
excellent
reason
i
have
something
else
than
myself
to
write
about
this
morning
phœbe
persuaded
me
to
walk
down
to
the
office
to
keep
up
my
spirits
and
get
some
salt
she
brought
my
things
and
put
them
on
me
while
i
was
hesitating
tied
my
victorine
and
buttoned
my
gloves
warmed
my
boots
and
fussed
about
me
as
if
i
had
been
a
baby
it
did
me
good
to
be
taken
care
of
and
i
thanked
her
softly
a
little
more
softly
than
i
am
apt
to
speak
to
phœbe
bless
your
soul
my
dear
she
said
winking
briskly
i
don
t
want
no
thanks
it
s
thanks
enough
jest
to
see
one
of
your
old
looks
comin
over
you
for
a
spell
sence
she
knocked
over
a
chair
with
her
broom
and
left
her
sentence
unfinished
phœbe
has
always
had
a
queer
clinging
superior
sort
of
love
for
us
both
she
dandled
us
on
her
knees
and
made
all
our
and
carried
us
through
measles
and
mumps
and
the
rest
then
mother
s
early
death
threw
all
the
care
upon
her
i
believe
that
in
her
secret
heart
she
considers
me
more
her
child
than
her
mistress
it
cost
a
great
many
battles
to
become
established
as
miss
i
should
like
to
know
she
would
say
throwing
back
her
great
square
shoulders
and
towering
up
in
front
of
me
i
should
like
to
know
if
you
s
pose
i
m
a
goin
to
miss
anybody
that
i
ve
trotted
to
bamberry
cross
as
many
times
as
i
have
you
mary
cabot
catch
me
i
remember
how
she
would
insist
on
calling
me
her
baby
after
i
was
in
long
dresses
and
that
it
mortified
me
cruelly
once
when
meta
tripp
was
here
to
tea
with
some
boston
cousins
poor
good
phœbe
her
rough
love
seems
worth
more
to
me
now
that
it
is
all
i
have
left
me
in
the
world
it
occurs
to
me
that
i
may
not
have
taken
notice
enough
of
her
lately
she
has
done
her
honest
best
to
comfort
me
and
she
loved
roy
too
but
about
the
letter
i
wrapped
my
face
up
closely
in
the
so
that
if
i
met
deacon
quirk
he
should
not
recognize
me
and
thinking
that
the
air
was
pleasant
as
i
walked
came
home
with
the
pork
for
phœbe
and
a
letter
for
myself
i
did
not
open
it
in
fact
i
forgot
all
about
it
till
i
had
been
at
home
for
half
an
hour
i
can
not
bear
to
open
a
letter
since
that
morning
when
the
lances
of
light
fell
on
the
snow
they
have
written
to
me
from
everywhere
uncles
and
cousins
and
old
people
saying
each
the
same
thing
in
the
same
way
no
not
that
exactly
and
very
likely
i
should
feel
hurt
and
lonely
if
they
did
not
write
but
sometimes
i
wish
it
did
not
all
have
to
be
read
so
i
did
not
notice
much
about
my
letter
this
morning
till
presently
it
occurred
to
me
that
what
must
be
done
had
better
be
done
quickly
so
i
drew
up
my
chair
to
the
desk
prepared
to
read
and
answer
on
the
spot
something
about
the
writing
and
the
signature
rather
pleased
me
it
was
dated
from
kansas
and
was
signed
with
the
name
of
my
mother
s
youngest
sister
winifred
forceythe
i
will
lay
the
letter
in
between
these
two
leaves
for
it
seems
to
suit
the
pleasant
day
besides
i
took
out
the
green
book
again
on
account
of
it
lawrence
kansas
february
my
dear
child
i
have
been
thinking
how
happy
you
will
be
by
and
by
because
roy
is
happy
and
yet
i
know
i
understand
you
have
been
in
all
my
thoughts
and
they
have
been
such
pitiful
tender
thoughts
that
i
can
not
help
letting
you
know
that
somebody
is
sorry
for
you
for
the
rest
the
heart
knoweth
its
own
and
i
am
after
all
too
much
of
a
stranger
to
my
sister
s
child
to
intermeddle
so
my
letter
dies
upon
my
pen
you
can
not
bear
words
yet
how
should
i
dare
to
fret
you
with
them
i
can
only
reach
you
by
my
silence
and
leave
you
with
the
heart
that
bled
and
broke
for
you
and
roy
your
aunt
winifred
forceythe
postscript
february
i
open
my
letter
to
add
that
i
am
thinking
of
coming
to
new
england
with
faith
you
know
faith
and
i
have
nobody
but
each
other
now
indeed
i
may
be
on
my
way
by
the
time
this
reaches
you
it
is
just
possible
that
i
may
not
come
back
to
the
west
i
shall
be
for
a
time
at
your
uncle
calvin
s
and
then
my
husband
s
friends
think
that
they
must
have
me
i
should
like
to
see
you
for
a
day
or
two
but
if
you
do
not
care
to
see
me
say
so
if
you
let
me
come
because
you
think
you
must
i
shall
find
it
out
from
your
face
in
an
hour
i
should
like
to
be
something
to
you
or
do
something
for
you
but
if
i
can
not
i
would
rather
not
come
i
like
that
letter
i
have
written
to
her
to
come
and
in
such
a
way
that
i
think
she
will
understand
me
to
mean
what
i
say
i
have
not
seen
her
since
i
was
a
child
i
know
that
she
was
very
much
younger
than
my
mother
that
she
spent
her
young
ladyhood
teaching
at
the
south
grandfather
had
enough
with
which
to
support
her
but
i
have
heard
it
said
that
she
preferred
to
take
care
of
herself
that
she
finally
married
a
poor
minister
whose
sermons
people
liked
but
whose
coat
was
shockingly
shabby
that
she
left
the
comforts
and
elegances
and
friends
of
new
england
to
go
to
the
west
and
bury
herself
in
an
little
place
with
him
i
think
she
must
have
loved
him
that
he
afterwards
settled
in
lawrence
that
there
after
they
had
been
married
some
childless
years
this
little
faith
was
born
and
that
there
uncle
forceythe
died
about
three
years
ago
that
is
about
all
i
know
of
her
i
suppose
her
share
of
grandfather
burleigh
s
little
property
supports
her
respectably
i
understand
that
she
has
been
living
a
sort
of
missionary
life
among
her
husband
s
people
since
his
death
and
that
they
think
they
shall
never
see
her
like
again
it
is
they
who
keep
her
from
coming
home
again
uncle
calvin
s
wife
told
me
once
they
and
one
other
thing
her
husband
s
grave
i
hope
she
will
come
to
see
me
i
notice
one
strange
thing
about
her
letter
she
does
not
use
the
ugly
words
death
and
i
don
t
know
exactly
what
she
put
in
their
places
but
something
that
had
a
pleasant
sound
to
be
happy
because
roy
is
i
wonder
if
she
really
thinks
it
is
possible
i
wonder
what
makes
the
words
chase
me
about
iv
may
i
am
afraid
that
my
brave
resolutions
are
all
breaking
down
the
stillness
of
the
may
days
is
creeping
into
everything
the
days
in
which
the
furlough
was
to
come
in
which
the
bitter
peace
has
come
instead
and
in
which
he
would
have
been
at
home
never
to
go
away
from
me
any
more
the
lazy
winds
are
choking
me
their
faint
sweetness
makes
me
sick
the
moist
rich
loam
is
ploughed
in
the
garden
the
grass
more
golden
than
green
springs
in
the
warm
hollow
by
the
front
gate
the
great
maple
just
reaching
up
to
tap
at
the
window
blazes
and
bows
under
its
weight
of
scarlet
blossoms
i
can
not
bear
their
perfume
it
comes
up
in
great
breaths
when
the
window
is
opened
i
wish
that
little
cricket
just
waked
from
his
winter
s
nap
would
not
sit
there
on
the
sill
and
chirp
at
me
i
hate
the
bluebirds
flashing
in
and
out
of
the
carmine
cloud
that
the
maple
makes
and
singing
singing
everywhere
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
bianca
heard
the
nightingales
sing
through
her
head
how
she
could
call
them
birds
who
sang
for
spite
who
sang
for
hate
who
sang
for
most
of
all
i
hate
the
maple
i
wish
winter
were
back
again
to
fold
it
away
in
white
with
its
bare
black
fingers
only
to
come
tapping
at
the
window
roy
s
maple
we
used
to
call
it
how
much
fun
he
had
out
of
that
old
tree
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
we
never
considered
spring
to
be
officially
introduced
till
we
had
had
a
fight
with
the
red
blossoms
roy
used
to
pelt
me
well
but
with
that
pretty
chivalry
of
his
which
was
rare
in
such
a
little
fellow
which
developed
afterwards
into
that
rarer
treatment
of
women
of
which
every
one
speaks
who
speaks
of
him
he
would
stop
the
play
the
instant
it
threatened
roughness
i
used
to
be
glad
though
that
i
had
strength
and
courage
enough
to
make
it
some
fun
to
him
the
maple
is
full
of
pictures
of
roy
roy
not
yet
over
the
dignity
of
his
first
boots
aiming
for
the
branch
coming
to
the
ground
with
a
terrible
wrench
on
his
ankle
straight
up
again
before
anybody
could
stop
him
and
sitting
there
on
the
ugly
swaying
bough
as
white
as
a
sheet
to
wave
his
cap
there
i
meant
to
do
it
and
i
have
roy
chopping
off
the
twigs
for
in
his
mud
oven
and
sending
his
hatchet
right
through
the
parlor
window
roy
cutting
leaves
for
me
and
then
pulling
all
my
wreaths
down
over
my
nose
every
time
i
put
them
on
roy
making
me
jump
across
the
room
with
a
sudden
thump
on
my
window
and
looking
out
i
would
see
him
with
his
hat
off
and
hair
blown
from
his
forehead
framed
in
by
the
scented
blossoms
or
the
quivering
green
or
the
flame
of
leaves
but
there
is
no
end
to
them
if
i
begin
i
had
planned
if
he
came
this
week
to
strip
the
richest
branches
and
fill
his
room
may
the
stillness
the
lazy
winds
the
sweetness
in
the
air
are
all
gone
a
miserable
northeasterly
storm
has
set
in
the
garden
loam
is
a
mass
of
mud
the
golden
grass
is
drenched
the
poor
little
cricket
is
drowned
in
a
the
bluebirds
are
huddled
among
the
leaves
with
their
heads
under
their
drabbled
wings
and
the
maple
blossoms
dull
and
shrunken
drip
against
the
glass
it
begins
to
be
evident
that
it
will
never
do
for
me
to
live
alone
yet
who
is
there
in
the
wide
world
that
i
could
bear
to
bring
here
into
roy
s
place
a
little
book
bound
in
green
and
gold
attracted
my
attention
this
morning
while
i
was
dusting
the
library
it
proved
to
be
my
mother
s
copy
of
elia
one
that
father
had
given
her
i
saw
by
the
in
their
early
engagement
days
it
is
some
time
since
i
have
read
charles
lamb
indeed
since
the
middle
of
february
i
have
read
nothing
of
any
sort
phœbe
dries
the
journal
for
me
every
night
and
sometimes
i
glance
at
the
telegraphic
summary
and
sometimes
i
don
t
you
used
to
be
fond
enough
of
books
mrs
bland
says
looking
puzzled
regular
mr
bland
called
you
no
personal
objection
to
you
of
course
my
dear
but
he
like
literary
women
which
is
a
great
comfort
to
me
why
don
t
you
read
and
divert
yourself
now
but
my
brain
like
the
rest
of
me
seems
to
be
crushed
i
could
not
follow
three
pages
of
history
with
attention
shakespeare
wordsworth
whittier
browning
are
filled
with
roy
s
marks
and
so
down
the
shelf
besides
poetry
strikes
as
nothing
else
does
deep
into
the
roots
of
things
one
finds
everywhere
some
strain
at
the
fibres
of
one
s
heart
a
mind
must
be
healthily
reconciled
to
actual
life
before
a
poet
at
least
most
poets
can
help
it
we
must
learn
to
bear
and
to
work
before
we
can
spare
strength
to
dream
to
hymns
and
poems
exception
should
be
made
some
of
them
are
like
soft
hands
stealing
into
ours
in
the
dark
and
holding
us
fast
without
a
spoken
word
i
do
not
know
how
many
times
whittier
s
psalm
and
that
old
cry
of
cowper
s
god
moves
in
a
mysterious
way
have
quieted
me
just
the
sound
of
the
words
when
i
was
too
wild
to
take
in
their
meaning
and
too
wicked
to
believe
them
if
i
had
as
to
novels
by
the
way
meta
tripp
sent
me
over
four
yesterday
afternoon
among
which
notice
aurora
floyd
and
uncle
silas
the
author
of
rutledge
expresses
my
feeling
about
them
precisely
i
do
not
remember
her
exact
words
but
they
are
not
unlike
these
she
had
far
outlived
the
passion
of
ordinary
novels
and
the
few
which
struck
the
depths
of
her
experience
gave
her
more
pain
than
however
i
took
up
poor
elia
this
morning
and
stumbled
upon
dream
children
to
which
for
pathos
and
symmetry
i
have
read
few
things
superior
in
the
language
years
ago
i
almost
knew
it
by
heart
but
it
has
slipped
out
of
memory
with
many
other
things
of
late
any
book
if
it
be
one
of
those
which
lamb
calls
books
which
books
put
before
us
at
different
periods
of
life
will
unfold
to
us
new
meanings
wheels
within
wheels
delicate
springs
of
purpose
to
which
at
the
last
reading
we
were
gems
which
perhaps
the
author
ignorantly
cut
and
polished
a
sentence
in
this
dream
children
which
at
eighteen
i
passed
by
with
a
compassionate
sort
of
wonder
only
thinking
that
it
gave
me
the
blues
to
read
it
and
that
i
was
glad
roy
was
alive
i
have
seized
upon
and
learned
all
over
again
now
i
write
it
down
to
the
dull
music
of
the
rain
and
how
when
he
died
though
he
had
not
been
dead
an
hour
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
died
a
great
while
ago
such
a
distance
there
is
betwixt
life
and
death
and
how
i
bore
his
death
as
i
thought
pretty
well
at
first
but
afterwards
it
haunted
and
haunted
me
and
though
i
did
not
cry
or
take
it
to
heart
as
some
do
and
as
i
think
he
would
have
done
if
i
had
died
yet
i
missed
him
all
day
long
and
knew
not
till
then
how
much
i
had
loved
him
i
missed
his
kindness
and
i
missed
his
crossness
and
wished
him
to
be
alive
again
to
be
quarrelling
with
him
for
we
quarrelled
sometimes
rather
than
not
have
him
how
still
the
house
is
i
can
hear
the
coach
rumbling
away
at
the
corner
coming
up
from
the
evening
train
a
little
arrow
of
light
has
just
cut
the
gray
gloom
of
the
west
ten
o
clock
the
coach
to
which
i
sat
listening
rumbled
up
to
the
gate
and
stopped
puzzled
for
the
moment
and
feeling
as
inhospitable
as
i
knew
how
i
went
down
to
the
door
the
driver
was
already
on
the
steps
with
a
bundle
in
his
arms
that
proved
to
be
a
rather
minute
child
and
a
lady
veiled
was
just
stepping
from
the
carriage
into
the
rain
of
course
i
came
to
my
senses
at
that
and
calling
to
phœbe
that
forceythe
had
come
sent
her
out
an
umbrella
she
surprised
me
by
running
lightly
up
the
steps
i
had
imagined
a
somewhat
advanced
age
and
a
sedate
amount
of
infirmities
to
be
necessary
concomitants
of
aunthood
she
came
in
all
sparkling
with
and
gently
pushing
aside
the
hand
with
which
i
was
trying
to
pay
her
driver
said
laughing
here
we
are
bag
and
baggage
you
see
big
trunk
little
trunk
you
did
not
expect
me
ah
my
letter
missed
then
it
is
too
bad
to
take
you
by
storm
in
this
way
come
faith
no
don
t
trouble
about
the
trunks
just
now
shall
i
go
right
in
here
her
voice
had
a
sparkle
in
it
like
the
drops
on
her
veil
but
it
was
low
and
very
sweet
i
took
her
in
by
the
fire
and
was
turning
to
take
off
the
little
girl
s
things
when
a
soft
hand
stayed
me
and
i
saw
that
she
had
drawn
off
the
wet
veil
a
face
somewhat
pale
looked
down
at
me
she
is
taller
than
i
with
large
compassionate
eyes
i
am
too
wet
to
kiss
you
but
i
must
have
a
look
she
said
smiling
that
will
do
you
are
like
your
mother
very
i
don
t
know
what
possessed
me
whether
it
was
the
sudden
sweet
feeling
of
kinship
with
something
alive
or
whether
it
was
her
face
or
her
voice
or
all
together
but
i
said
i
don
t
think
you
are
too
wet
to
be
kissed
and
threw
my
arms
about
her
neck
i
am
not
of
the
kissing
kind
either
and
i
had
on
my
new
bombazine
and
she
very
wet
i
thought
she
looked
pleased
phœbe
was
sent
to
open
the
register
in
the
blue
room
and
as
soon
as
it
was
warm
i
went
up
with
them
leading
faith
by
the
hand
i
am
unused
to
children
and
she
kept
stepping
on
my
dress
and
spinning
around
and
tipping
over
in
the
most
astonishing
manner
it
strikingly
reminded
me
of
a
top
at
the
last
gasp
her
mother
observed
that
she
was
tired
and
sleepy
phœbe
was
waiting
around
awkwardly
up
stairs
with
fresh
towels
on
her
arm
aunt
winifred
turned
and
held
out
her
hand
well
phœbe
i
am
glad
to
see
you
this
is
phœbe
i
am
sure
you
have
altered
with
everything
else
since
i
was
here
before
you
keep
bright
and
well
i
hope
and
take
good
care
of
miss
mary
it
was
a
simple
enough
thing
to
be
sure
her
taking
the
trouble
to
notice
the
old
servant
with
whom
she
had
scarcely
ever
exchanged
a
words
but
i
liked
it
i
liked
the
way
too
in
which
it
was
done
it
reminded
me
of
roy
s
fine
manner
towards
his
inferiors
always
cordial
yet
always
appropriate
i
have
heard
that
our
mother
had
much
the
same
i
tried
to
make
things
look
as
pleasant
as
i
could
down
stairs
while
they
were
making
ready
for
tea
the
grate
was
raked
up
a
little
a
bright
laid
on
the
table
and
the
curtains
drawn
phœbe
mixed
a
hasty
cake
of
some
sort
and
brought
out
the
heavier
pieces
of
silver
which
i
do
not
use
when
i
am
alone
because
it
is
so
much
trouble
to
take
care
of
them
and
because
i
like
the
little
wedgwood
set
that
roy
had
for
his
chocolate
how
pleasant
said
aunt
winifred
as
she
sat
down
with
faith
in
a
high
chair
beside
her
phœbe
had
a
great
hunt
up
garret
for
that
chair
it
has
been
stowed
away
there
since
it
and
i
parted
company
how
pleasant
everything
is
here
i
believe
in
bright
there
is
an
indescribable
dinginess
to
most
that
i
have
seen
which
tends
to
anything
but
thankfulness
homesick
faith
no
that
s
right
i
don
t
think
we
shall
be
homesick
at
cousin
mary
if
she
had
not
said
that
the
probabilities
are
that
they
would
have
been
for
i
have
fallen
quite
out
of
the
way
of
active
housekeeping
and
have
almost
forgotten
how
to
entertain
a
friend
but
i
do
not
want
her
good
opinion
wasted
and
mean
they
shall
have
a
good
time
if
i
can
make
it
for
them
it
was
a
little
hard
at
first
to
see
her
opposite
me
at
the
table
it
was
roy
s
place
while
she
was
sitting
there
in
the
light
with
the
dust
and
weariness
of
travel
brushed
away
a
little
i
was
able
to
make
up
my
mind
what
this
aunt
of
mine
looks
like
she
is
young
then
to
begin
with
and
i
find
it
necessary
to
reiterate
the
fact
in
order
to
get
it
into
my
stupid
brain
the
cape
and
spectacles
the
little
old
woman
s
shawl
and
invalid
s
walk
for
which
i
had
prepared
myself
persist
in
hovering
before
my
bewildered
eyes
ready
to
drop
down
on
her
at
a
moment
s
notice
just
she
is
by
her
own
showing
older
than
i
to
be
sure
but
as
we
passed
in
front
of
the
mirror
together
once
i
could
not
see
half
that
difference
between
us
the
peace
of
her
face
and
the
pain
of
mine
contrast
sharply
and
give
me
an
old
worn
look
beside
her
after
all
though
to
one
who
had
seen
much
of
life
hers
would
be
the
true
maturity
perhaps
the
maturity
of
repose
a
look
in
her
eyes
once
or
twice
gave
me
the
impression
that
she
thinks
me
rather
young
though
she
is
far
too
wise
and
delicate
to
show
it
i
don
t
like
to
be
treated
like
a
girl
i
mean
to
find
out
what
she
does
think
my
eyes
have
been
on
her
face
the
whole
evening
and
i
believe
it
is
the
sweetest
face
woman
s
face
that
i
have
ever
seen
yet
she
is
far
from
being
a
beautiful
woman
it
is
difficult
to
say
what
makes
the
impression
scarcely
any
feature
is
accurate
yet
the
seems
to
have
no
fault
her
hair
which
must
have
been
bright
bronze
once
has
grown
gray
quite
gray
before
its
time
i
really
do
not
know
of
what
color
her
eyes
are
blue
perhaps
most
frequently
but
they
change
with
every
word
that
she
speaks
when
quiet
they
have
a
curious
look
and
a
steady
lambent
light
shines
through
them
her
mouth
is
well
cut
and
delicate
yet
you
do
not
so
much
notice
that
as
its
expression
it
looks
as
if
it
held
a
happy
secret
with
which
however
near
one
may
come
to
her
one
can
never
intermeddle
yet
there
are
lines
about
it
and
on
her
forehead
which
are
proof
plain
enough
that
she
has
not
always
floated
on
summer
seas
she
yet
wears
her
widow
s
black
but
relieves
it
pleasantly
by
white
at
the
throat
and
wrists
take
her
altogether
i
like
to
look
at
her
faith
is
a
round
rolling
rollicking
little
piece
of
mischief
with
three
years
and
a
half
of
experience
in
this
very
happy
world
she
has
black
eyes
and
a
pretty
chin
funny
little
pink
hands
all
covered
with
dimples
and
a
dimple
in
one
cheek
besides
she
has
tipped
over
two
tumblers
of
water
scratched
herself
all
over
playing
with
the
cat
and
set
her
apron
on
fire
already
since
she
has
been
here
i
stand
in
some
awe
of
her
but
after
i
have
become
initiated
i
think
that
we
shall
be
very
good
friends
of
all
names
in
the
catalogue
i
said
to
her
mother
when
she
came
down
into
the
parlor
after
putting
her
to
bed
faith
seems
to
be
about
the
inappropriate
for
this
twinkling
little
bairn
of
yours
with
her
pretty
red
cheeks
and
such
an
appetite
for
supper
yes
she
said
laughing
there
is
nothing
about
faith
but
she
means
just
that
to
me
i
could
not
call
her
anything
else
her
father
gave
her
the
her
face
changed
but
did
not
sadden
a
quietness
crept
into
it
and
into
her
voice
but
that
was
all
i
will
tell
you
about
it
sometime
perhaps
she
added
rising
and
standing
by
the
fire
faith
looks
like
her
eyes
assumed
their
distant
look
like
the
eyes
of
those
who
see
the
dead
and
gazed
away
so
far
away
into
the
fire
that
i
felt
that
she
would
not
be
listening
to
anything
that
i
might
say
and
therefore
said
nothing
we
spent
the
evening
chatting
cosily
after
the
fire
had
died
down
in
the
grate
i
had
phœbe
light
a
there
because
i
noticed
that
aunt
winifred
fancied
the
blaze
in
the
we
drew
up
our
chairs
into
the
corner
by
the
register
and
roasted
away
to
our
hearts
content
a
very
bad
habit
to
sit
over
the
register
and
aunt
winifred
says
she
shall
undertake
to
break
me
of
it
we
talked
about
everything
under
the
sun
uncles
aunts
cousins
kansas
and
connecticut
the
surrenders
and
the
assassination
books
pictures
music
and
faith
o
and
phœbe
and
the
cat
aunt
winifred
talks
well
and
does
not
gossip
nor
exhaust
her
resources
one
feels
always
that
she
has
material
in
reserve
on
any
subject
that
is
worth
talking
about
for
one
thing
i
thank
her
with
all
my
heart
she
never
spoke
of
roy
upon
reflection
i
find
that
i
have
really
passed
a
pleasant
evening
she
knocked
at
my
door
just
now
after
i
had
written
the
last
sentence
and
had
put
away
the
book
for
the
night
thinking
that
it
was
phœbe
i
called
come
in
and
did
not
turn
she
had
come
to
the
bureau
where
i
stood
unbraiding
my
hair
and
touched
my
arm
before
i
saw
who
it
was
she
had
on
a
crimson
of
warm
flannel
and
her
hair
hung
down
on
her
shoulders
although
so
gray
her
hair
is
massive
yet
and
coils
finely
when
she
is
dressed
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
but
i
thought
you
would
not
be
in
bed
and
i
came
in
to
say
let
me
sit
somewhere
else
at
the
if
you
like
i
saw
that
i
had
taken
the
vacant
good
night
my
it
was
such
a
little
thing
i
wonder
how
many
people
would
have
noticed
it
or
taken
the
trouble
to
speak
of
it
the
quick
perception
the
unusual
delicacy
these
too
are
like
roy
i
almost
wish
that
she
had
stayed
a
little
longer
i
almost
think
that
i
could
bear
to
have
her
speak
to
me
about
him
faith
in
the
next
room
seems
to
have
wakened
from
a
frightened
dream
and
i
can
hear
their
voices
through
the
wall
her
mother
is
soothing
and
singing
to
her
in
the
broken
words
of
some
old
lullaby
with
which
phœbe
used
to
sing
roy
and
me
to
sleep
years
and
years
ago
the
unfamiliar
sound
is
pleasant
in
the
silent
house
phœbe
on
her
way
to
bed
is
stopping
on
the
to
listen
to
it
even
the
cat
comes
mewing
up
to
the
door
and
purring
as
i
have
not
heard
the
creature
purr
since
the
old
singing
hushed
so
long
ago
may
i
was
awakened
and
nearly
smothered
this
morning
by
a
pillow
thrown
directly
at
my
head
somewhat
unaccustomed
in
the
respectable
old
maid
s
life
that
i
lead
to
such
a
pleasant
little
method
of
salutation
i
jerked
myself
upright
and
stared
there
stood
faith
in
her
laughing
as
if
she
would
suffocate
and
her
mother
in
search
of
her
was
just
knocking
at
the
open
door
she
insisted
on
going
to
wake
cousin
mary
and
wouldn
t
be
washed
till
i
let
her
but
i
stipulated
that
she
should
kiss
you
softly
on
both
your
i
did
said
faith
stoutly
i
kissed
her
eyes
both
two
of
em
and
her
nose
and
her
mouth
and
her
neck
then
i
pulled
her
hair
and
then
i
spinched
her
but
i
thought
she
d
have
to
be
banged
a
little
it
a
bang
though
it
really
did
me
good
to
begin
the
day
with
a
hearty
laugh
the
days
usually
look
so
long
and
blank
at
the
beginning
that
i
can
hardly
make
up
my
mind
to
step
out
into
them
faith
s
pillow
was
the
famous
pebble
in
the
pond
to
which
authors
of
original
imagination
invariably
resort
i
felt
its
little
circles
widening
out
all
through
the
day
i
wonder
if
aunt
winifred
thought
of
that
she
thinks
of
many
things
for
instance
afraid
apparently
that
i
should
think
i
was
afflicted
with
one
of
those
professional
visitors
who
hold
that
a
chance
relationship
justifies
them
in
imposing
on
one
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
she
managed
to
make
me
understand
this
morning
that
she
was
expecting
to
go
back
to
uncle
forceythe
s
brother
on
saturday
i
was
surprised
at
myself
to
find
that
this
proposition
struck
me
with
dismay
i
insisted
with
all
my
heart
on
keeping
her
for
a
week
at
the
least
and
sent
forth
a
fiat
that
her
trunks
should
be
unpacked
we
have
had
a
quiet
homelike
day
faith
found
her
way
to
the
orchard
and
installed
herself
there
for
the
day
overhauling
the
muddy
grass
with
her
bare
hands
to
find
dandelions
she
came
in
at
as
brown
as
a
little
nut
with
her
hat
hanging
down
her
neck
her
apron
torn
and
just
about
as
dirty
as
i
should
suppose
it
possible
for
a
clean
child
to
succeed
in
making
herself
her
mother
however
seemed
to
be
quite
used
to
it
and
the
expedition
with
which
she
made
her
presentable
i
regard
as
a
stroke
of
genius
while
faith
was
disposed
of
and
the
house
still
auntie
and
i
took
our
knitting
and
spent
a
regular
old
woman
s
morning
at
the
south
window
in
the
in
the
afternoon
mrs
bland
came
over
babies
and
all
and
sent
up
her
card
to
forceythe
came
and
still
there
had
not
been
a
word
of
roy
i
began
to
wonder
at
while
i
respected
this
unusual
silence
while
her
mother
was
putting
faith
to
bed
i
went
into
my
room
alone
for
a
few
moments
quiet
an
early
dark
had
fallen
for
it
had
clouded
up
just
before
sunset
the
dull
gray
sky
and
narrow
horizon
shut
down
and
crowded
in
everything
a
soldier
from
the
village
who
has
just
come
home
was
walking
down
the
street
with
his
wife
and
sister
the
crickets
were
chirping
in
the
meadows
the
faint
breath
of
the
maple
came
up
i
sat
down
by
the
window
and
hid
my
face
in
both
my
hands
i
must
have
sat
there
some
time
for
i
had
quite
forgotten
that
i
had
company
to
entertain
when
the
door
softly
opened
and
shut
and
some
one
came
and
sat
down
on
the
couch
beside
me
i
did
not
speak
for
i
could
not
and
the
first
i
knew
a
gentle
arm
crept
about
me
and
she
had
gathered
me
into
her
lap
and
laid
my
head
on
her
shoulder
as
she
might
have
gathered
faith
there
she
said
in
her
low
lulling
voice
now
tell
auntie
all
about
i
don
t
know
what
it
was
whether
the
voice
or
touch
or
words
but
it
came
so
suddenly
and
nobody
had
held
me
for
so
long
that
everything
seemed
to
break
up
and
unlock
in
a
minute
and
i
threw
up
my
hands
and
cried
i
don
t
know
how
long
i
cried
she
passed
her
hand
softly
to
and
fro
across
my
hair
brushing
it
away
from
my
temples
while
they
throbbed
and
burned
but
she
did
not
speak
by
and
by
i
sobbed
out
auntie
auntie
auntie
as
faith
sobs
out
in
the
dark
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
must
have
help
or
die
yes
dear
i
understand
i
know
how
hard
it
is
and
you
have
been
bearing
it
alone
so
long
i
am
going
to
help
you
and
you
must
tell
me
all
you
the
strong
decided
words
i
am
going
to
help
you
gave
me
the
first
faint
hope
i
have
had
that
i
be
helped
and
i
could
tell
her
it
was
not
sacrilege
the
story
of
these
weeks
all
the
time
her
hand
went
softly
to
and
fro
across
my
hair
presently
when
i
was
weak
and
faint
with
the
new
comfort
of
my
tears
aunt
winifred
i
said
i
don
t
know
what
it
means
to
be
resigned
i
don
t
know
what
it
still
her
hand
passed
softly
to
and
fro
across
my
hair
to
have
everything
stop
all
at
once
without
giving
me
any
time
to
learn
to
bear
it
why
you
do
not
know
it
is
just
as
if
a
great
black
gate
had
swung
to
and
barred
out
the
future
and
barred
out
him
and
left
me
all
alone
in
any
world
that
i
can
ever
live
in
forever
and
my
child
she
said
with
emphasis
solemn
and
low
upon
the
words
my
child
i
know
i
think
you
forget
my
i
had
forgotten
how
could
i
we
are
most
selfishly
blinded
by
our
own
griefs
no
other
form
than
ours
ever
seems
to
walk
with
us
in
the
furnace
her
few
words
made
me
feel
as
i
could
not
have
felt
if
she
had
said
more
that
this
woman
who
was
going
to
help
me
had
suffered
too
had
suffered
perhaps
more
than
i
that
if
i
sat
as
a
little
child
at
her
feet
she
could
teach
me
through
the
kinship
of
her
pain
o
my
dear
she
said
and
held
me
close
i
have
trodden
every
step
of
it
before
you
every
single
but
you
never
were
so
wicked
about
it
you
never
felt
why
i
have
been
i
should
hate
god
you
never
were
so
wicked
as
low
under
her
breath
she
answered
yes
this
sweet
saintly
woman
who
had
come
to
me
in
the
dark
as
an
angel
might
then
turning
suddenly
her
voice
trembled
and
broke
mary
mary
do
you
think
he
have
lived
those
years
and
be
cruel
to
you
now
think
that
over
and
over
only
that
it
may
be
the
only
thought
you
dare
to
have
it
was
all
i
dared
to
have
once
but
cling
to
it
with
both
mary
and
keep
i
only
put
both
hands
about
her
neck
and
clung
there
but
i
hope
it
seems
as
if
i
clung
a
little
to
the
thought
besides
it
was
as
new
and
sweet
to
me
as
if
i
had
never
heard
of
it
in
all
my
life
and
it
has
not
left
me
yet
and
then
my
dear
she
said
when
she
had
let
me
cry
a
little
longer
when
you
have
once
found
out
that
roy
s
god
loves
you
more
than
roy
does
the
rest
comes
more
easily
it
will
not
be
as
long
to
wait
as
it
seems
now
it
isn
t
as
if
you
never
were
going
to
see
him
i
looked
up
bewildered
what
s
the
matter
dear
why
do
you
think
i
shall
see
him
really
see
him
mary
cabot
she
said
abruptly
turning
to
look
at
me
who
has
been
talking
to
you
about
this
thing
deacon
quirk
i
answered
faintly
deacon
quirk
and
she
put
her
other
arm
around
me
with
a
quick
movement
as
if
she
would
shield
me
from
deacon
quirk
and
dr
bland
do
i
think
you
will
see
him
again
you
might
as
well
ask
me
if
i
thought
god
made
you
and
made
roy
and
gave
you
to
each
other
see
him
why
of
course
you
will
see
him
as
you
saw
him
as
i
saw
him
here
why
here
i
looked
into
his
eyes
i
saw
him
smile
i
touched
him
why
aunt
winifred
roy
is
an
angel
she
patted
my
hand
with
a
little
soft
comforting
laugh
but
he
is
not
any
the
less
roy
for
that
not
any
the
less
your
own
real
roy
who
will
love
you
and
wait
for
you
and
be
very
glad
to
see
you
as
he
used
to
love
and
wait
and
be
glad
when
you
came
home
from
a
journey
on
a
cold
winter
and
he
met
me
at
the
door
and
led
me
in
where
it
was
light
and
warm
i
sobbed
so
he
will
meet
you
at
the
door
in
this
other
home
and
lead
you
into
the
light
and
the
warmth
and
can
not
that
make
the
cold
and
dark
a
little
shorter
think
a
minute
but
there
is
god
i
thought
we
went
to
heaven
to
worship
him
and
shall
you
worship
more
heartily
or
less
for
having
roy
again
did
mary
love
the
master
more
or
less
after
lazarus
came
back
why
my
child
where
did
you
get
your
ideas
of
god
don
t
you
suppose
he
how
you
love
roy
i
drank
in
the
blessed
words
without
doubt
or
argument
i
was
too
thirsty
to
doubt
or
argue
some
other
time
i
may
ask
her
how
she
knows
this
beautiful
thing
but
not
now
all
i
can
do
now
is
to
take
it
into
my
heart
and
hold
it
there
roy
my
own
again
not
only
to
look
at
standing
up
among
the
singers
but
close
to
me
somehow
or
other
to
be
as
near
as
to
be
nearer
than
he
was
here
mine
again
i
shall
never
let
this
go
after
we
had
talked
awhile
and
when
it
came
time
to
say
good
night
i
told
her
a
little
about
my
conversation
with
deacon
quirk
and
what
i
said
to
him
about
the
lord
s
will
i
did
not
know
but
that
she
would
blame
me
some
time
she
said
turning
her
great
compassionate
eyes
on
me
i
could
feel
them
in
the
dark
and
smiling
you
will
find
out
all
at
once
in
a
happy
moment
that
you
can
say
those
words
with
all
your
heart
and
with
all
your
soul
and
with
all
your
strength
it
will
come
even
in
this
world
if
you
will
only
let
it
but
until
it
does
you
do
right
quite
right
not
to
scorch
your
altar
with
a
false
god
is
not
a
god
to
be
mocked
he
would
rather
have
only
the
old
cry
i
believe
help
mine
unbelief
and
wait
till
you
can
say
the
rest
it
has
often
grated
on
my
ears
she
added
to
hear
people
speak
those
words
unworthily
they
seem
to
me
the
most
solemn
words
that
the
bible
contains
or
that
christian
experience
can
utter
as
far
as
my
observation
goes
the
good
people
for
they
are
good
people
who
use
them
when
they
ought
to
know
better
are
of
two
sorts
they
are
people
in
actual
agony
bewildered
racked
with
rebellious
doubts
unaccustomed
to
own
even
to
themselves
the
secret
seethings
of
sin
really
persuaded
that
because
it
is
a
christian
duty
to
have
no
will
but
the
lord
s
they
are
under
obligations
to
affirm
that
they
have
no
will
but
the
lord
s
or
else
they
are
people
who
know
no
more
about
this
pain
of
bereavement
than
a
child
an
affliction
has
passed
over
them
put
them
into
mourning
made
them
feel
uncomfortable
till
the
funeral
was
over
or
even
caused
them
a
shallow
sort
of
grief
of
which
each
week
evaporates
a
little
till
it
is
gone
these
mourners
air
their
trouble
the
longest
prate
loudest
about
resignation
and
have
the
most
to
say
to
you
or
me
about
our
rebellious
state
of
poor
things
one
can
hardly
be
vexed
at
them
for
pity
think
of
being
made
so
there
is
still
another
class
of
the
cheerfully
resigned
i
suggested
who
are
even
more
ready
than
these
to
tell
you
of
your
desperate
wickedness
people
who
have
never
had
even
the
semblance
of
a
trouble
in
all
their
lives
she
interrupted
yes
i
was
going
to
speak
of
them
of
all
miserable
comforters
they
are
the
most
as
to
real
instant
submission
she
said
presently
there
some
of
it
in
the
world
there
are
sweet
rare
lives
capable
of
great
loves
and
great
pains
which
yet
are
kept
so
attuned
to
the
life
of
christ
that
the
cry
in
the
garden
comes
scarcely
less
honestly
from
their
lips
than
from
his
such
like
the
john
are
but
one
among
the
twelve
such
it
will
do
you
and
me
good
dear
at
least
to
such
i
thought
when
i
was
left
alone
you
new
dear
friend
of
mine
who
have
come
with
such
a
blessed
coming
into
my
lonely
days
such
you
must
be
now
whatever
you
were
if
i
should
tell
her
that
how
she
would
open
her
soft
eyes
vi
may
as
i
was
looking
over
the
green
book
last
night
aunt
winifred
came
up
behind
me
and
softly
laid
a
bunch
of
violets
down
between
the
leaves
by
an
odd
contrast
the
contented
passionless
things
fell
against
those
two
verses
that
were
copied
from
the
german
and
completely
covered
them
from
sight
i
lifted
the
flowers
and
held
up
the
page
for
her
to
see
as
she
read
her
face
altered
strangely
her
eyes
dilated
her
lip
quivered
a
flush
shot
over
her
checks
and
dyed
her
forehead
up
to
the
waves
of
her
hair
i
turned
away
quickly
feeling
that
i
had
committed
a
rudeness
in
watching
her
and
detecting
in
her
however
involuntarily
some
far
inner
sympathy
or
shadow
of
a
sympathy
with
the
desperate
words
mary
she
said
laying
down
the
book
i
believe
satan
wrote
she
laughed
a
little
then
nervously
and
paled
back
into
her
quiet
peaceful
self
i
mean
that
he
inspired
it
they
are
wicked
words
you
must
not
read
them
over
you
will
outgrow
them
sometime
with
a
beautiful
growth
of
trust
and
love
let
them
alone
till
that
time
comes
see
i
will
blot
them
out
of
sight
for
you
with
colors
as
blue
as
heaven
the
heaven
where
god
be
loved
the
she
shook
apart
the
thick
sweet
nosegay
and
taking
a
of
the
little
blossoms
pinned
them
dripping
with
fragrant
dew
upon
the
lines
there
i
shall
let
them
stay
and
since
she
wishes
it
i
shall
not
lift
them
to
see
the
reckless
words
till
i
can
do
it
safely
this
afternoon
aunt
winifred
has
been
telling
me
about
herself
somewhat
more
or
of
a
different
kind
i
should
imagine
from
what
she
has
told
most
people
she
seems
to
love
me
a
little
not
in
a
proper
kind
of
way
because
i
happen
to
be
her
niece
but
for
my
own
sake
it
surprises
me
to
find
how
pleased
i
am
that
she
should
that
kansas
life
must
have
been
very
hard
to
her
in
contrast
as
it
was
with
the
smooth
elegance
of
her
girlhood
she
was
very
young
too
when
she
undertook
it
i
said
something
of
the
sort
to
her
they
have
been
the
hardest
and
the
easiest
the
saddest
and
the
happiest
years
of
all
my
life
she
answered
i
pondered
the
words
in
my
heart
while
i
listened
to
her
story
she
gave
me
vivid
pictures
of
the
long
bright
bridal
journey
overshadowed
with
a
very
mundane
weariness
of
jolting
coaches
and
railway
accidents
before
its
close
of
the
little
neglected
hamlet
which
waited
for
them
twenty
miles
from
a
and
thirty
from
a
of
the
parsonage
a
among
distinguished
and
adorned
by
a
little
lath
and
plastering
glass
windows
and
a
doorstep
they
drew
in
sight
of
it
at
the
close
of
a
tired
day
with
a
red
sunset
lying
low
on
the
flats
uncle
forceythe
wanted
and
he
found
here
with
i
should
say
with
a
vengeance
if
the
expression
were
exactly
suited
to
an
elegantly
constructed
and
reflective
journal
my
heart
sank
for
a
moment
i
confess
she
said
but
it
never
would
do
you
know
to
let
him
suspect
that
so
i
smiled
away
as
well
as
i
knew
how
shook
hands
with
one
or
two
women
in
red
calico
who
had
been
slicking
up
inside
they
said
went
in
by
the
fire
it
was
really
a
pleasant
fire
and
as
soon
as
they
had
left
us
alone
i
climbed
into
john
s
lap
and
with
both
arms
around
his
neck
told
him
that
i
knew
we
should
be
very
happy
and
i
said
said
what
she
blushed
a
little
like
a
girl
i
believe
i
said
i
should
be
happy
in
patagonia
with
him
i
made
him
laugh
at
last
and
say
that
my
face
and
words
were
like
a
beautiful
prophecy
and
mary
if
they
were
it
was
beautifully
fulfilled
in
the
roughest
times
times
of
ragged
clothes
and
empty
of
weakness
and
sickness
and
quack
doctors
of
cold
and
discouragement
of
prairie
fires
and
guerillas
from
trouble
to
trouble
from
year
s
end
to
year
s
end
we
were
happy
together
we
two
as
long
as
we
could
have
each
other
and
as
long
as
we
could
be
about
our
master
s
business
we
felt
as
if
we
did
not
dare
to
ask
for
anything
more
lest
it
should
seem
that
we
were
ungrateful
for
such
wealth
of
it
would
take
too
long
to
write
out
here
the
half
that
she
told
me
though
i
wish
i
could
for
it
interested
me
more
than
any
story
that
i
have
ever
read
after
years
of
toiling
to
help
those
rough
old
farmers
and
wicked
bushwhackers
to
heaven
the
call
to
lawrence
came
and
it
seemed
to
uncle
forceythe
that
he
had
better
go
it
was
a
pleasant
influential
parish
and
there
though
not
less
hard
at
work
they
found
fewer
rubs
and
more
comforts
there
faith
came
and
there
were
their
pleasant
days
till
the
i
held
my
breath
to
hear
her
tell
about
quantrell
s
raid
there
too
uncle
wasted
through
that
consumption
there
he
fell
on
sleep
she
said
and
there
she
buried
him
she
gave
me
no
further
description
of
his
death
than
those
words
and
she
spoke
them
with
her
tearless
eyes
looking
off
through
the
window
and
after
she
had
spoken
she
was
still
for
a
time
the
heart
knoweth
its
own
bitterness
that
grew
distinct
to
me
as
i
sat
shut
out
by
her
silence
yet
there
was
nothing
bitter
about
her
face
faith
was
six
months
old
when
he
went
she
said
presently
we
had
never
named
her
baby
was
name
enough
at
first
for
such
a
wee
thing
then
she
was
the
only
one
and
had
come
so
late
that
it
seemed
to
mean
more
to
us
than
to
most
to
have
a
baby
all
to
ourselves
and
we
liked
the
sound
of
the
word
when
it
became
quite
certain
that
john
must
go
we
used
to
talk
it
over
and
he
said
that
he
would
like
to
name
her
but
what
he
did
not
tell
me
at
last
one
night
after
he
had
lain
for
a
while
thinking
with
closed
eyes
he
bade
me
bring
the
child
to
him
the
sun
was
setting
i
remember
and
the
moon
was
rising
he
had
had
a
hard
day
the
life
was
all
scorched
out
of
the
air
i
moved
the
bed
up
by
the
window
that
he
might
have
the
breath
of
the
rising
wind
baby
was
wide
awake
cooing
softly
to
herself
in
the
cradle
her
bits
of
damp
curls
clinging
to
her
head
and
her
pink
feet
in
her
hands
i
took
her
up
and
brought
her
just
as
she
was
and
knelt
down
by
the
bed
the
street
was
still
we
could
hear
the
frogs
chanting
a
mile
away
he
lifted
her
little
hands
upon
his
own
and
said
no
matter
about
the
words
but
he
told
me
that
as
he
left
the
child
so
he
left
the
name
in
my
sacred
charge
that
he
had
chosen
it
for
me
that
when
he
was
out
of
sight
it
might
help
me
to
have
it
often
on
my
lips
so
there
in
the
sunset
and
the
moonrise
we
two
alone
together
he
baptized
her
and
we
gave
our
little
girl
to
when
she
had
said
this
she
rose
and
went
over
to
the
window
and
stood
with
her
face
from
me
by
and
by
it
was
the
fourteenth
she
said
as
if
musing
to
herself
the
fourteenth
of
i
remember
now
that
uncle
forceythe
died
on
the
fourteenth
of
june
it
may
have
been
that
the
words
of
that
baptismal
blessing
were
the
last
that
they
heard
either
child
or
mother
may
it
has
been
a
pleasant
day
the
air
shines
like
transparent
gold
the
wind
sweeps
like
somebody
s
strong
arms
over
the
flowers
and
gathers
up
a
crowd
of
perfumes
that
wander
up
and
down
about
one
the
church
bells
have
rung
out
like
silver
all
day
those
bells
especially
the
second
advent
at
the
further
end
of
the
village
are
positively
ghastly
when
it
rains
aunt
winifred
was
dressed
bright
and
early
for
church
i
in
morning
dress
and
slippers
sighed
and
demurred
auntie
you
expect
to
hear
anything
new
judging
from
your
diagnosis
of
dr
bland
to
be
edified
refreshed
strengthened
or
instructed
perhaps
bored
then
not
what
do
you
expect
there
are
the
prayers
and
singing
generally
one
can
if
one
tries
wring
a
little
devotion
from
the
worst
of
them
as
to
a
minister
if
he
is
good
and
commonplace
young
and
earnest
and
ignorant
and
i
whom
he
can
not
help
one
step
on
the
way
to
heaven
consequently
stay
at
home
deacon
quirk
whom
he
might
carry
a
mile
or
two
by
and
by
stays
at
home
also
if
there
is
to
be
a
building
fitly
joined
together
each
stone
must
do
its
part
of
the
upholding
i
feel
better
to
go
half
a
day
always
i
never
compel
faith
to
go
but
i
never
have
a
chance
for
she
teases
not
to
be
left
at
i
think
it
s
splendid
to
go
to
church
most
the
time
put
in
faith
who
was
squatted
on
the
carpet
counting
sugared
caraway
seeds
all
but
the
sermon
that
isn
t
splendid
i
don
t
like
the
big
prayers
n
things
i
like
caramary
seeds
though
mother
always
gives
em
to
me
in
meeting
cause
i
m
a
good
girl
don
t
you
wish
were
a
good
girl
cousin
mary
so
s
you
could
have
some
besides
i
ve
got
on
my
best
hat
and
my
besides
there
used
to
be
a
real
funny
little
boy
up
in
meeting
at
home
and
he
gave
me
a
little
tin
dorg
once
over
the
top
the
pew
only
mother
made
me
give
it
back
o
you
ought
to
seen
the
man
that
preached
down
at
uncle
calvin
s
i
tell
you
he
was
a
bully
old
minister
banged
the
bible
like
there
s
a
devotional
spirit
for
you
i
said
to
her
mother
well
she
answered
laughing
it
is
better
than
that
she
should
be
left
to
play
dolls
and
eat
preserves
and
be
punished
for
disobedience
sunday
would
invariably
become
a
guilty
sort
of
holiday
at
that
rate
now
caraways
or
bully
old
ministers
notwithstanding
she
carries
to
bed
with
her
a
dim
notion
that
this
has
been
holy
time
and
pleasant
time
besides
the
associations
of
a
childhood
if
i
can
manage
them
genially
will
be
a
help
to
her
when
she
is
older
come
faith
go
and
pull
off
cousin
mary
s
slippers
and
bring
down
her
boots
and
then
she
ll
have
to
go
to
church
no
i
say
that
you
might
tickle
her
feet
feeling
the
least
bit
sorry
that
i
had
set
the
example
of
a
christian
before
the
child
i
went
directly
up
stairs
to
make
ready
and
we
started
after
all
in
good
season
dr
bland
was
in
the
pulpit
i
observed
that
he
looked
as
indeed
did
the
congregation
bodily
with
some
curiosity
into
our
slip
where
it
has
been
a
rare
occurrence
of
late
to
find
me
and
where
the
light
falling
through
the
little
stained
glass
oriel
touched
aunt
winifred
s
thoughtful
smile
i
wondered
whether
dr
bland
thought
it
was
wicked
for
people
to
smile
in
church
no
of
course
he
has
too
much
sense
i
wonder
what
it
is
about
dr
bland
that
always
suggests
such
questions
it
has
been
very
warm
all
day
that
aggravating
unseasonable
heat
which
is
apt
to
come
in
spasms
in
the
early
part
of
may
and
which
in
thick
spring
alpaca
and
heavy
sack
one
finds
intolerable
the
thermometer
stood
at
on
the
church
porch
every
window
was
shut
and
everybody
s
fan
was
fluttering
now
with
this
sight
before
him
what
should
our
observant
minister
do
but
give
out
as
his
first
hymn
thine
earthly
thine
earthly
sabbaths
would
be
a
beautiful
hymn
if
it
were
not
for
those
lines
about
the
weather
no
midnight
shade
clouded
sacred
high
eternal
there
was
a
great
hot
sunbeam
striking
directly
on
my
black
bonnet
my
fan
was
broken
i
gasped
for
air
the
choir
went
over
and
over
and
the
words
spinning
them
into
one
of
those
indescribable
tunes
in
which
everybody
seems
to
be
trying
to
get
through
first
i
don
t
know
what
they
called
them
they
always
remind
me
of
a
game
of
i
looked
at
aunt
winifred
she
took
it
more
coolly
than
i
but
an
amused
little
smile
played
over
her
face
she
told
me
after
church
that
she
had
repeatedly
heard
that
hymn
given
out
at
noon
of
an
intense
july
day
her
husband
she
said
used
to
save
it
for
the
winter
or
for
cloudy
afternoons
using
means
of
grace
he
called
that
however
dr
bland
did
better
the
second
time
aunt
winifred
joined
in
the
singing
and
i
enjoyed
it
so
i
will
not
blame
the
poor
man
i
suppose
he
was
so
far
lifted
above
this
earth
that
he
would
not
have
known
whether
he
was
preaching
in
greenland
s
icy
mountains
or
on
india
s
coral
strand
when
he
announced
his
text
for
our
conversation
is
in
heaven
aunt
winifred
and
i
exchanged
glances
of
content
we
had
been
talking
about
heaven
on
the
way
to
church
at
least
till
faith
not
finding
herself
entertained
interrupted
us
by
some
severe
speculations
as
to
whether
maltese
kitties
were
mulattoes
and
why
the
didn
t
jump
off
the
steeple
some
night
and
see
if
he
couldn
t
fly
right
up
the
way
elijah
i
listened
to
dr
bland
as
i
have
not
listened
for
a
long
time
the
subject
was
of
all
subjects
nearest
my
heart
he
is
a
scholarly
man
in
his
way
he
ought
to
know
i
thought
more
about
it
than
aunt
winifred
perhaps
he
could
help
me
his
sermon
as
nearly
as
i
can
recall
it
was
substantially
this
the
future
life
presented
a
vast
theme
to
our
speculation
theories
too
numerous
to
mention
had
been
held
concerning
it
pagans
had
believed
in
a
coming
state
of
rewards
and
punishments
what
natural
theology
had
dimly
foreshadowed
revelation
had
brought
in
like
a
day
with
healing
on
its
i
am
not
positive
about
the
metaphors
as
it
was
fitting
that
we
should
at
times
turn
our
thoughts
upon
the
threatenings
of
scripture
it
was
eminently
suitable
also
that
we
should
consider
its
promises
he
proposed
in
this
discourse
to
consider
the
promise
of
heaven
the
reward
offered
by
christ
to
his
good
and
faithful
servants
in
the
first
place
what
is
heaven
i
am
not
quite
clear
in
my
mind
what
it
was
though
i
tried
my
best
to
find
out
as
nearly
as
i
can
recollect
however
heaven
is
an
eternal
state
heaven
is
a
state
of
holiness
heaven
is
a
state
of
having
heard
these
observations
before
i
will
not
enlarge
as
he
did
upon
them
but
leave
that
for
the
vivid
imagination
of
the
green
book
in
the
second
place
what
will
be
the
employments
of
heaven
we
shall
study
the
character
of
god
an
infinite
mind
must
of
necessity
be
eternally
an
object
of
study
to
a
finite
mind
the
finite
mind
must
of
necessity
find
in
such
study
supreme
delight
all
lesser
joys
and
interests
will
pale
he
felt
at
moments
in
reflecting
on
this
theme
that
that
good
brother
who
on
being
asked
if
he
expected
to
see
the
dead
wife
of
his
youth
in
heaven
replied
i
expect
to
be
so
overwhelmed
by
the
glory
of
the
presence
of
god
that
it
may
be
thousands
of
years
before
i
shall
think
of
my
wife
he
felt
that
perhaps
this
brother
was
near
the
poor
mrs
bland
looked
exceedingly
uncomfortable
we
shall
also
glorify
he
enlarged
upon
this
division
but
i
have
forgotten
exactly
how
there
was
something
about
adoration
and
the
harpers
harping
with
their
harps
and
the
sea
of
glass
and
crying
worthy
the
lamb
and
a
great
deal
more
that
bewildered
and
disheartened
me
so
that
i
could
scarcely
listen
to
it
i
do
not
doubt
that
we
shall
glorify
god
primarily
and
happily
but
can
we
not
do
it
in
some
other
way
than
by
harping
and
praying
we
shall
moreover
love
each
other
with
a
universal
and
unselfish
that
we
shall
recognize
our
friends
in
heaven
he
was
inclined
to
think
after
mature
deliberation
was
probable
but
there
would
be
no
special
selfish
affections
there
in
this
world
we
have
enmities
and
favoritisms
in
the
world
of
bliss
our
hearts
would
glow
with
holy
love
alike
to
all
other
holy
i
wonder
if
he
really
thought
would
make
a
world
of
aunt
winifred
slipped
her
hand
into
mine
under
her
cloak
ah
dr
bland
if
you
had
known
how
that
little
soft
touch
was
preaching
against
you
in
the
words
of
an
eminent
divine
who
has
long
since
entered
into
the
joys
of
which
he
spoke
thus
whenever
the
mind
roves
through
the
immense
region
of
heaven
it
will
find
among
all
its
innumerable
millions
not
an
enemy
not
a
stranger
not
an
indifferent
heart
not
a
reserved
bosom
disguise
here
and
even
concealment
will
be
unknown
the
soul
will
have
no
interests
to
conceal
thoughts
to
a
window
will
be
opened
in
every
breast
and
show
to
every
eye
the
rich
and
beautiful
furniture
within
thirdly
how
shall
we
fit
for
heaven
he
mentioned
several
ways
among
which
we
should
subdue
our
earthly
affections
to
god
we
must
not
love
the
creature
as
the
creator
my
son
give
thy
heart
when
he
removes
our
friends
from
the
scenes
of
time
with
a
glance
in
my
direction
we
should
resign
ourselves
to
his
will
remembering
that
the
lord
gave
and
the
lord
hath
taken
away
in
mercy
that
he
is
all
in
all
that
he
will
never
leave
us
nor
forsake
us
that
can
never
change
or
as
if
that
made
any
difference
with
the
fact
that
his
best
treasures
change
or
die
in
conclusion
we
infer
from
our
text
that
our
hearts
should
not
be
set
upon
earthly
happiness
enlarged
that
the
subject
of
heaven
should
be
often
in
our
thoughts
and
on
our
enlarged
of
course
i
have
not
done
justice
to
the
filling
up
of
the
sermon
to
the
illustrations
metaphors
learning
and
eloquence
for
though
dr
bland
can
not
seem
to
think
outside
of
the
old
grooves
a
little
eloquence
really
flashes
through
the
tameness
of
his
style
sometimes
and
when
he
was
talking
about
the
harpers
some
of
his
words
were
well
chosen
to
be
drowned
in
light
i
have
somewhere
read
may
be
very
beautiful
it
is
still
to
be
but
i
have
given
the
skeleton
of
the
discourse
and
i
have
given
the
sum
of
the
impressions
that
it
left
on
me
an
attentive
hearer
it
is
fortunate
that
i
did
not
hear
it
while
i
was
alone
it
would
have
made
me
desperate
going
hungry
hopeless
blinded
i
came
back
empty
uncomforted
groping
i
wanted
something
actual
something
pleasant
about
this
place
into
which
roy
has
gone
he
gave
me
glittering
generalities
cold
commonplace
vagueness
unreality
a
god
and
a
future
at
which
i
sat
and
shivered
dr
bland
is
a
good
man
he
had
i
know
written
that
sermon
with
prayer
i
only
wish
that
he
could
be
made
to
how
it
glides
over
and
sails
splendidly
away
from
wants
like
mine
but
thanks
be
to
god
who
has
provided
a
voice
to
answer
me
out
of
the
deeps
auntie
and
i
walked
home
without
any
remarks
we
overheard
deacon
quirk
observe
to
a
neighbor
that
s
what
i
call
a
good
gospel
sermon
now
sent
faith
away
to
phœbe
sat
down
in
the
parlor
and
looked
at
each
other
well
said
i
i
know
it
said
she
upon
which
we
both
began
to
laugh
but
did
he
say
the
dreadful
truth
not
as
i
find
it
in
my
that
it
is
probable
only
that
we
shall
recognize
my
child
do
not
be
troubled
about
that
it
is
not
probable
it
is
sure
if
i
could
find
no
proof
for
it
i
should
none
the
less
believe
it
as
long
as
i
believe
in
god
he
gave
you
roy
and
the
capacity
to
love
him
he
has
taught
you
to
sanctify
that
love
through
love
to
him
would
it
be
him
to
create
such
beautiful
and
unselfish
loves
most
like
the
love
of
heaven
of
any
type
we
know
just
for
our
threescore
years
and
ten
of
earth
would
it
be
like
him
to
suffer
two
souls
to
grow
together
here
so
that
the
separation
of
a
day
is
pain
and
then
wrench
them
apart
for
all
eternity
it
would
be
what
madame
de
gasparin
calls
fearful
irony
on
the
part
of
but
there
are
lost
loves
there
are
lost
how
often
would
i
have
gathered
you
and
ye
would
not
that
is
not
his
work
he
would
have
saved
both
soul
and
love
they
had
their
own
way
we
were
speaking
of
his
redeemed
the
object
of
having
this
world
at
all
you
know
is
to
fit
us
for
another
of
what
use
will
it
have
been
if
on
passing
out
of
it
we
must
throw
by
forever
its
gifts
its
lessons
its
memories
god
links
things
together
better
than
that
be
sure
as
you
are
sure
of
him
that
we
shall
be
in
heaven
would
you
be
yourself
not
to
recognize
roy
consequently
not
to
love
roy
for
to
love
and
to
be
separated
is
misery
and
heaven
is
i
understand
but
you
said
you
had
other
so
i
have
plenty
of
it
if
many
shall
come
from
the
east
and
from
the
west
and
shall
sit
down
in
the
kingdom
of
god
with
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
will
they
not
be
likely
to
know
that
they
are
with
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
or
will
they
think
it
is
shadrach
meshech
and
abednego
what
is
meant
by
such
expressions
as
risen
sitting
at
the
right
hand
of
god
sitting
in
heavenly
places
if
they
mean
anything
they
mean
recognitions
friendships
enjoyments
did
not
peter
and
the
others
know
moses
when
they
saw
him
know
elias
when
they
saw
him
yet
these
men
were
dead
hundreds
of
years
before
the
favored
fishermen
were
born
how
was
it
with
those
saints
which
slept
and
arose
when
christ
hung
dead
there
in
the
dark
were
they
not
seen
of
many
but
that
was
a
they
were
risen
dead
such
as
you
and
i
shall
be
some
day
the
miracle
consisted
in
their
rising
then
and
there
moreover
did
not
the
beggar
recognize
abraham
and
well
one
might
go
through
the
bible
finding
it
full
of
this
promise
in
hints
or
assertions
in
parables
or
visions
we
are
heirs
of
god
joint
heirs
with
christ
having
suffered
with
him
we
shall
be
glorified
christ
himself
has
said
many
sure
things
i
will
come
and
receive
you
that
where
i
am
there
ye
may
i
will
that
they
be
with
me
where
i
using
too
the
very
type
of
godhead
to
signify
the
eternal
nearness
and
eternal
love
of
just
such
as
you
and
roy
as
john
and
me
he
prays
holy
father
keep
them
whom
thou
hast
given
me
that
may
be
one
as
we
there
is
one
place
though
where
i
find
what
i
like
better
than
all
the
rest
you
remember
that
old
cry
wrung
from
the
lips
of
the
stricken
king
i
shall
go
to
him
but
he
will
not
return
to
i
never
thought
before
how
simple
and
direct
it
is
and
that
too
in
those
old
blinded
the
more
i
study
the
bible
she
said
and
i
study
not
entirely
in
ignorance
of
the
commentators
and
the
mysteries
the
more
perplexed
i
am
to
imagine
where
the
current
ideas
of
our
future
come
from
they
certainly
are
not
in
this
book
of
gracious
promises
that
heaven
which
we
heard
about
was
bland
s
not
god
s
it
s
aye
a
wonderfu
thing
to
me
as
poor
lauderdale
said
the
way
some
preachers
take
it
upon
themselves
to
explain
matters
to
the
almighty
but
the
harps
and
choirs
the
throne
the
white
robes
are
all
in
revelation
deacon
quirk
would
put
his
great
brown
finger
on
the
verses
and
hold
you
there
can
t
people
tell
picture
from
substance
a
metaphor
from
its
meaning
that
book
of
revelation
is
precisely
what
it
professes
to
be
a
vision
a
symbol
a
symbol
of
something
to
be
sure
and
rich
with
pleasant
hopes
but
still
a
symbol
now
i
really
believe
that
a
large
proportion
of
christian
who
have
studied
their
bible
attended
sabbath
schools
listened
to
sermons
all
their
lives
if
you
could
fairly
come
at
their
most
definite
idea
of
the
place
where
they
expect
to
spend
eternity
would
own
it
to
be
the
golden
city
with
pearl
gates
and
jewels
in
the
wall
it
never
occurs
to
them
that
if
one
picture
is
literal
another
must
be
if
we
are
to
walk
golden
streets
how
can
we
stand
on
a
sea
of
glass
how
can
we
sit
on
thrones
how
can
untold
millions
of
us
lie
in
abraham
s
bosom
but
why
have
given
us
empty
symbols
why
not
a
little
fact
they
are
not
symbols
and
why
god
did
not
give
us
actual
descriptions
of
actual
heavenly
life
i
don
t
trouble
myself
to
wonder
he
certainly
had
his
reasons
and
that
is
enough
for
me
i
find
from
these
symbols
and
from
his
voice
in
my
own
heart
many
beautiful
things
i
will
tell
you
some
more
of
them
at
another
time
and
for
the
rest
i
am
content
to
wait
he
loves
me
and
he
loves
mine
as
long
as
we
love
him
he
will
never
separate
himself
from
us
or
us
from
each
other
that
at
least
is
if
that
is
sure
the
rest
is
of
less
importance
yes
but
dr
bland
said
an
awful
thing
the
quotation
from
a
dead
divine
yes
that
there
will
be
no
separate
interests
no
thoughts
to
poor
good
man
he
has
found
out
by
this
time
that
he
should
not
have
laid
down
nonsense
like
that
without
qualification
or
demur
before
a
hearer
it
was
simply
opinion
not
david
s
or
paul
s
or
john
s
or
isaiah
s
he
had
a
perfect
right
to
put
it
in
the
form
of
a
conjecture
nobody
would
forbid
his
conjecturing
that
the
inhabitants
of
heaven
are
all
deaf
and
dumb
or
wear
green
glasses
or
shave
their
heads
if
he
chose
provided
he
stated
that
it
was
conjecture
not
but
where
does
the
bible
say
that
we
shall
have
power
to
conceal
our
thoughts
and
i
would
rather
be
annihilated
than
to
spend
eternity
with
heart
laid
bare
the
inner
temple
thrown
open
to
be
trampled
on
by
every
passing
stranger
the
bible
specifies
very
little
about
the
minor
arrangements
of
eternity
in
any
way
but
i
doubt
if
under
any
circumstances
it
would
have
occurred
to
inspired
men
to
inform
us
that
our
thoughts
shall
continue
to
be
our
own
the
fact
is
patent
on
the
face
of
things
the
dead
minister
s
supposition
would
destroy
individuality
at
one
fell
swoop
we
should
be
like
a
man
walking
down
a
room
lined
with
mirrors
who
sees
himself
reflected
in
all
sizes
colors
shades
at
all
angles
and
in
all
proportions
according
to
the
capacity
of
the
mirror
till
he
seems
no
longer
to
belong
to
himself
but
to
be
cut
up
into
ellipses
and
octagons
and
prisms
how
soon
would
he
grow
frantic
in
such
companionship
and
beg
for
a
corner
where
he
might
hide
and
hush
himself
in
the
dark
that
we
shall
in
a
higher
life
be
able
to
do
what
we
can
not
in
this
judge
fairly
of
each
other
s
worth
is
undoubtedly
true
whatever
the
judgment
day
may
mean
that
is
the
substance
of
it
but
this
promiscuous
theory
of
refraction
never
besides
wherever
the
bible
touches
the
subject
it
premises
our
individuality
as
a
matter
of
course
what
would
be
the
use
of
talking
if
everybody
knew
the
thoughts
of
everybody
else
you
don
t
suppose
that
people
talk
in
heaven
i
don
t
suppose
anything
else
are
we
to
spend
ages
of
joy
a
company
of
mutes
together
why
not
talk
i
supposed
we
should
sing
but
why
not
talk
as
well
as
sing
does
not
song
involve
the
faculty
of
speech
unless
you
would
like
to
make
canaries
of
why
there
are
the
visitors
at
the
beautiful
mount
of
transfiguration
again
did
not
they
with
each
other
and
with
christ
did
not
john
with
the
angel
who
shewed
him
those
things
and
you
mean
to
say
i
mean
to
say
that
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
common
sense
you
will
talk
with
roy
as
you
talked
with
him
here
only
not
as
you
talked
with
him
here
because
there
will
be
no
troubles
nor
sins
no
anxieties
nor
cares
to
talk
about
no
ugly
shades
of
cross
words
or
little
quarrels
to
be
made
up
no
fearful
of
i
laid
my
head
upon
her
shoulder
and
could
hardly
speak
for
the
comfort
that
she
gave
me
yes
i
believe
we
shall
talk
and
laugh
and
joke
and
play
laugh
and
joke
in
heaven
why
not
but
it
seems
so
so
why
so
wicked
and
irreverent
and
all
that
you
just
then
faith
who
mounted
out
on
the
kitchen
table
was
preaching
at
phœbe
in
comical
mimicry
of
bland
s
choicest
intonations
laughed
out
like
the
splash
of
a
little
wave
the
sound
came
in
at
the
open
door
and
we
stopped
to
listen
till
it
had
rippled
away
there
said
her
mother
put
that
child
this
very
minute
with
all
her
little
sins
forgiven
into
one
of
our
dear
lord
s
many
mansions
and
do
you
suppose
that
she
would
be
any
the
less
holy
or
less
reverent
for
a
laugh
like
that
is
he
going
to
check
all
the
sparkle
and
blossom
of
life
when
he
takes
us
to
himself
i
don
t
believe
any
such
thing
there
were
both
sense
and
christianity
in
what
somebody
wrote
on
the
death
of
a
humorous
poet
does
nobody
laugh
there
where
he
has
gone
this
man
of
the
smile
and
the
jest
provided
there
was
any
hope
that
the
poor
fellow
gone
to
heaven
if
not
it
was
bad
philosophy
and
worse
religion
did
not
david
dance
before
the
lord
with
all
his
might
a
bible
which
is
full
of
happy
rejoice
in
the
lord
make
a
joyful
noise
unto
him
give
thanks
unto
the
lord
for
his
mercy
endureth
a
bible
which
exhausts
its
splendid
wealth
of
rhetoric
to
make
us
understand
that
the
coming
life
is
a
life
of
no
more
threatens
to
make
nuns
than
mutes
of
us
i
expect
that
you
will
hear
some
of
roy
s
very
old
jokes
see
the
sparkle
in
his
eye
listen
to
his
laughing
voice
lighten
up
the
happy
days
as
gleefully
as
you
may
choose
and
that
faith
appeared
upon
the
scene
just
then
with
the
interesting
information
that
she
had
bitten
her
tongue
so
we
talked
no
more
how
pleasant
how
pleasant
this
is
i
never
supposed
before
that
god
would
let
any
one
laugh
in
heaven
i
wonder
if
roy
has
seen
the
president
aunt
winifred
says
she
does
not
doubt
it
she
thinks
that
all
the
soldiers
must
have
crowded
up
to
meet
him
and
o
she
says
what
a
sight
to
see
vii
may
aunt
winifred
has
said
something
about
going
but
i
can
not
yet
bear
to
hear
of
such
a
thing
she
is
to
stay
a
while
longer
we
have
been
over
to
the
grave
she
proposed
to
go
by
herself
thinking
i
saw
with
the
delicacy
with
which
she
always
thinks
that
i
would
rather
not
be
there
with
another
nor
should
i
nor
could
i
with
any
other
than
this
woman
it
is
strange
i
wished
to
go
there
with
her
i
had
a
vague
unreasoning
feeling
that
she
would
take
away
some
of
the
bitterness
of
it
as
she
has
taken
the
bitterness
of
much
else
it
is
looking
very
pleasant
there
now
the
turf
has
grown
fine
and
smooth
the
low
hedge
and
knots
of
norway
spruce
that
father
planted
long
ago
for
mother
drop
cool
green
shadows
that
stir
with
the
wind
my
english
ivy
has
crept
about
and
about
the
cross
roy
used
to
say
that
he
should
fancy
a
cross
to
mark
the
spot
where
he
might
lie
i
think
he
would
like
this
pure
unveined
marble
cover
the
grave
now
and
steal
out
among
the
with
a
flush
like
sunrise
by
and
by
there
will
be
roses
and
in
august
august
s
own
white
lilies
we
went
silently
over
and
sat
silently
down
on
the
grass
the
stretching
away
to
the
little
church
behind
us
and
beyond
in
front
the
slope
the
flats
the
river
the
hills
cut
in
purple
distance
melting
far
into
the
east
the
air
was
thick
with
perfume
golden
bees
hung
giddily
over
the
blush
in
the
grass
in
the
low
branches
that
swept
the
grave
a
little
bird
had
built
her
nest
aunt
winifred
did
not
speak
to
me
for
a
time
nor
watch
my
face
presently
she
laid
her
hand
upon
my
lap
and
i
put
mine
into
it
it
is
very
pleasant
here
she
said
then
in
her
very
pleasant
voice
i
meant
that
it
should
be
i
answered
trying
not
to
let
her
see
my
lips
quiver
at
least
it
must
not
look
neglected
i
don
t
suppose
it
makes
any
difference
to
i
do
not
feel
sure
of
what
do
you
mean
i
do
not
feel
sure
that
anything
he
has
left
makes
no
difference
to
but
i
don
t
understand
he
is
in
heaven
he
would
be
too
happy
to
care
for
anything
that
is
going
on
in
this
woful
perhaps
that
is
so
she
said
smiling
a
sweet
contradiction
to
her
words
but
i
don
t
believe
what
do
you
believe
many
things
that
i
have
to
say
to
you
but
you
can
not
bear
them
i
have
sometimes
wondered
for
i
can
not
help
it
i
said
whether
he
is
shut
off
from
all
knowledge
of
me
for
all
these
years
till
i
can
go
to
him
it
will
be
a
great
while
it
seems
hard
roy
would
want
to
know
something
if
it
were
only
a
little
about
i
believe
that
he
wants
to
know
and
that
he
knows
mary
though
since
the
belief
must
rest
on
analogy
and
conjecture
you
need
not
accept
it
as
demonstrated
mathematics
she
answered
with
another
smile
roy
never
forgot
me
here
i
said
not
meaning
to
sob
that
is
just
it
he
was
not
constituted
so
that
he
remaining
himself
roy
could
forget
you
if
he
goes
out
into
this
other
life
forgetting
he
becomes
another
than
himself
that
is
a
far
more
unnatural
way
of
creeping
out
of
the
difficulty
than
to
assume
that
he
loves
and
remembers
why
not
assume
that
in
fact
why
assume
anything
else
neither
reason
nor
the
bible
nor
common
sense
forbids
it
instead
of
starting
with
it
as
an
hypothesis
to
be
proved
if
we
can
i
lay
it
down
as
one
of
those
probabilities
for
which
butler
would
say
the
presumption
amounts
nearly
to
certainty
and
if
any
one
can
disprove
it
i
will
hear
what
he
has
to
say
there
she
broke
off
laughing
softly
that
is
a
sufficient
dose
of
metaphysics
for
such
a
simple
thing
it
seems
to
me
to
lie
just
here
roy
loved
you
our
father
for
some
tender
hidden
reason
took
him
out
of
your
sight
for
a
while
though
changed
much
he
can
have
forgotten
nothing
being
out
of
you
remember
not
lost
nor
asleep
nor
annihilated
he
goes
on
loving
to
love
must
mean
to
think
of
to
care
for
to
hope
for
to
pray
for
not
less
out
of
a
body
than
in
but
that
must
mean
why
that
must
mean
that
he
is
near
you
i
do
not
doubt
the
sunshine
quivered
in
among
the
and
i
turned
to
watch
it
thinking
i
do
not
doubt
she
went
on
speaking
low
i
can
not
doubt
that
our
absent
dead
are
very
present
with
us
he
said
i
am
with
you
alway
knowing
the
need
we
have
of
him
even
to
the
end
of
the
world
he
must
understand
the
need
we
have
of
them
i
can
not
doubt
i
watched
her
as
she
sat
with
her
absent
eyes
turned
eastward
and
her
peculiar
look
i
have
never
seen
it
on
another
face
as
of
one
who
holds
a
happy
secret
and
while
i
watched
i
wondered
there
is
a
reason
for
it
she
said
rousing
as
if
from
a
pleasant
dream
a
good
sensible
reason
too
it
strikes
me
independent
of
scriptural
or
other
what
is
that
that
god
keeps
us
briskly
at
work
in
this
i
did
not
understand
altogether
too
briskly
considering
that
it
is
a
preparative
world
to
intend
to
put
us
from
it
into
an
idle
one
what
more
natural
than
that
we
shall
spend
our
best
energies
as
we
spent
them
here
in
comforting
teaching
helping
saving
people
whose
very
souls
we
love
better
than
our
own
in
fact
it
would
be
very
if
we
did
but
i
thought
that
god
took
care
of
us
and
angels
like
gabriel
and
the
rest
if
i
ever
thought
anything
about
it
which
i
am
inclined
to
god
works
by
the
use
of
means
as
the
preachers
say
why
not
use
roy
as
well
as
gabriel
what
archangel
could
understand
and
reach
the
peculiarities
of
your
nature
as
he
could
or
even
if
understanding
could
so
love
and
bear
with
you
what
is
to
be
done
will
they
send
roy
to
the
planet
jupiter
to
take
care
of
somebody
else
s
sister
i
laughed
in
spite
of
myself
nor
did
the
laugh
seem
to
jar
upon
the
sacred
stillness
of
the
place
her
words
were
drawing
away
the
bitterness
as
the
sun
was
blotting
the
dull
dead
greens
of
the
ivy
into
its
glow
of
golden
color
but
the
bible
aunt
the
bible
does
say
a
great
deal
on
this
point
she
said
but
it
does
not
contradict
me
in
fact
it
helps
me
and
moreover
it
would
uphold
me
in
black
and
white
if
it
weren
t
for
one
little
and
that
that
frowning
original
greek
which
gail
hamilton
denounces
with
her
righteous
indignation
no
sooner
do
i
find
a
pretty
verse
that
is
exactly
what
i
want
than
up
hops
a
commentator
and
says
this
isn
t
according
to
text
and
means
something
entirely
different
and
barnes
says
this
and
stuart
believes
that
and
olshausen
has
demonstrated
the
other
and
very
ignorant
it
is
in
you
too
not
to
know
it
here
the
other
day
i
ferreted
out
a
sentence
in
revelation
that
seemed
to
prove
beyond
question
that
angels
and
redeemed
men
were
the
same
where
the
angel
says
to
john
you
know
am
i
not
of
thy
brethren
the
prophets
i
thought
that
i
had
discovered
a
delightful
thing
which
all
the
fathers
of
the
church
had
overlooked
and
went
in
great
glee
to
your
uncle
calvin
to
be
told
that
something
was
the
matter
a
noun
left
out
or
some
other
unanswerable
and
unreasonable
horror
i
don
t
know
what
and
that
it
didn
t
mean
that
he
was
of
thy
brethren
the
prophets
at
all
you
see
if
it
could
be
proved
that
the
christian
dead
become
angels
we
could
have
all
that
we
need
direct
from
god
about
to
use
the
beautiful
old
phrase
the
communion
of
saints
from
genesis
to
revelation
the
bible
is
filled
with
angels
who
are
at
work
on
earth
they
hold
sweet
converse
with
abraham
in
his
tent
they
are
intrusted
to
save
the
soul
of
lot
an
angel
hears
the
wail
of
hagar
the
beautiful
feet
of
an
angel
bring
the
good
tidings
to
maiden
mary
an
angel
s
noiseless
step
guides
peter
through
the
barred
and
bolted
gate
angels
rolled
the
stone
from
the
buried
christ
and
angels
sat
there
in
the
solemn
morning
o
mary
if
we
could
have
seen
them
then
there
is
that
one
question
direct
comprehensive
we
should
not
need
anything
else
are
they
not
all
ministering
spirits
sent
forth
to
minister
to
the
heirs
of
salvation
but
you
see
it
never
seems
to
have
entered
those
commentators
heads
that
all
these
beautiful
things
refer
to
any
but
a
superior
race
of
beings
like
those
from
whose
ranks
lucifer
how
stupid
in
them
i
take
comfort
in
thinking
so
but
to
be
serious
even
admitting
that
these
passages
refer
to
a
superior
race
must
there
not
be
some
similarity
in
the
laws
which
govern
existence
in
the
heavenly
world
since
these
gracious
deeds
are
performed
by
what
we
are
accustomed
to
call
spiritual
beings
why
may
they
not
as
well
be
done
by
people
from
this
world
as
from
anywhere
else
besides
there
is
another
point
and
a
reasonable
one
to
be
made
the
word
angel
in
the
original
a
means
strictly
it
applies
to
any
servant
of
god
animate
or
inanimate
an
east
wind
is
as
much
an
angel
as
michael
again
the
generic
terms
spirits
gods
sons
of
god
are
used
interchangeably
for
saints
and
for
angels
so
you
see
i
fancy
that
i
find
a
way
for
you
and
roy
and
me
and
all
of
us
straight
into
the
shining
ministry
mary
mary
wouldn
t
you
like
to
go
this
very
afternoon
a
ἄγγελος
she
lay
back
in
the
grass
with
her
face
to
the
sky
and
drew
a
long
breath
wearily
i
do
not
think
she
meant
me
to
hear
it
i
did
not
answer
her
for
it
came
over
me
with
such
a
hopeless
thrill
how
good
it
would
be
to
be
taken
to
roy
there
by
his
beautiful
grave
with
the
ivy
and
the
and
the
sunlight
and
the
round
about
and
that
it
could
not
be
and
how
long
it
was
to
wait
it
came
over
me
so
that
i
could
not
speak
there
she
said
suddenly
rousing
what
a
thoughtless
wicked
thing
it
was
to
say
and
i
meant
to
give
you
only
the
good
cheer
of
a
cheery
friend
no
i
do
not
care
to
go
this
afternoon
nor
any
afternoon
till
my
father
is
ready
for
me
wherever
he
has
most
for
me
to
do
there
i
wish
yes
i
think
i
to
stay
he
knows
after
a
pause
i
asked
again
why
did
he
not
tell
us
more
about
this
thing
about
their
presence
with
us
you
see
if
i
could
it
the
mystery
of
the
bible
lies
not
so
much
in
what
it
says
as
in
what
it
does
not
say
she
replied
but
i
suppose
that
we
have
been
told
all
that
we
can
comprehend
in
this
world
knowledge
on
one
point
might
involve
knowledge
on
another
like
the
links
of
a
chain
till
it
stretched
far
beyond
our
capacity
at
any
rate
it
is
not
for
me
to
break
the
silence
that
is
god
s
affair
i
can
only
accept
the
fact
nevertheless
as
chalmers
says
it
were
well
for
us
all
could
we
carefully
draw
the
line
between
the
secret
things
which
belong
to
god
and
the
things
which
are
revealed
and
belong
to
us
and
to
our
some
one
else
whately
i
think
i
remember
to
have
noticed
as
speaking
about
these
very
subjects
to
this
effect
that
precisely
because
we
know
so
little
of
them
it
is
the
more
important
that
we
should
endeavor
so
to
dwell
on
them
as
to
make
the
most
of
what
little
knowledge
we
aunt
winifred
you
are
such
a
comfort
it
needs
our
best
faith
she
said
to
bear
this
reticence
of
god
i
can
not
help
thinking
sometimes
of
a
thing
lauderdale
said
i
am
always
quoting
him
from
son
of
the
soil
you
remember
it
s
an
awfu
marvel
beyond
my
reach
when
a
word
of
communication
would
make
a
the
difference
why
it
s
no
permitted
if
it
were
but
to
keep
a
heart
from
breaking
now
and
think
of
poor
eugénie
de
guèrin
trying
to
continue
her
little
journal
to
maurice
in
heaven
till
the
awful
answerless
stillness
shut
up
the
book
and
laid
aside
the
pen
but
then
she
continued
there
is
this
to
remember
i
may
have
borrowed
the
idea
or
it
may
be
my
own
that
if
we
could
speak
to
them
or
they
to
us
there
would
be
no
death
for
there
would
be
no
separation
the
last
the
surest
in
some
cases
the
only
test
of
loyalty
to
god
would
thus
be
taken
away
roman
catholic
nature
is
human
nature
when
it
comes
upon
its
knees
before
a
saint
many
lives
all
such
lives
as
yours
and
mine
would
become
would
become
what
one
long
defiance
to
the
first
i
can
not
become
used
to
such
words
from
such
quiet
lips
yet
they
give
me
a
curious
sense
of
the
trustworthiness
of
her
peace
founded
upon
a
rock
it
seems
to
be
she
has
done
what
it
takes
a
lifetime
for
some
of
us
to
do
what
some
of
us
go
into
eternity
leaving
undone
what
i
am
afraid
i
shall
never
do
sounded
her
own
nature
she
knows
the
worst
of
herself
and
faces
it
as
fairly
i
believe
as
anybody
can
do
in
this
world
as
for
the
best
of
herself
she
trusts
that
to
christ
and
he
knows
it
and
we
i
hope
she
in
her
sweet
humbleness
will
know
it
some
day
i
suppose
nevertheless
she
said
that
roy
knows
what
you
are
doing
and
feeling
as
well
as
perhaps
better
than
he
knew
it
three
months
ago
so
he
can
help
you
without
harming
i
asked
her
turning
suddenly
how
that
could
be
and
yet
heaven
be
heaven
how
he
could
see
me
suffer
what
i
had
suffered
could
see
me
sometimes
when
i
supposed
none
but
god
had
seen
me
and
sing
on
and
be
happy
you
are
not
the
first
mary
and
you
will
not
be
the
last
to
ask
that
question
i
can
not
answer
it
and
i
never
heard
of
any
who
could
i
feel
sure
only
of
this
that
he
would
suffer
far
less
to
see
you
than
to
know
nothing
about
you
and
that
god
s
power
of
inventing
happiness
is
not
to
be
blocked
by
an
obstacle
like
this
perhaps
roy
sees
the
end
from
the
beginning
and
can
bear
the
sight
of
pain
for
the
peace
that
he
watches
coming
to
meet
you
i
do
not
know
that
does
not
perplex
me
now
it
only
makes
me
anxious
for
one
what
is
that
that
you
and
i
shall
not
do
anything
to
make
them
to
make
them
sorry
roy
would
care
roy
would
be
disappointed
to
see
you
make
life
a
hopeless
thing
for
his
sake
or
to
see
you
doubt
his
do
you
think
some
sort
of
mourning
over
sin
enters
that
happy
life
god
himself
was
grieved
forty
years
long
over
his
wandering
people
among
the
angels
there
has
been
silence
whatever
that
mysterious
pause
may
mean
just
as
there
is
joy
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
another
of
my
that
to
show
that
they
are
allowed
to
keep
us
in
then
you
think
you
really
think
that
roy
remembers
and
loves
and
takes
care
of
me
that
he
has
been
listening
perhaps
and
is
why
you
don
t
think
he
may
be
yes
i
do
here
close
beside
you
all
this
time
trying
to
speak
to
you
through
the
blessed
sunshine
and
the
flowers
trying
to
help
you
and
sure
to
love
you
right
here
dear
i
do
not
believe
god
means
to
send
him
away
from
you
my
heart
was
too
full
to
answer
her
seeing
how
it
was
she
slipped
away
and
strolling
out
of
sight
with
her
face
to
the
eastern
hills
left
me
alone
and
yet
i
did
not
seem
alone
the
low
branches
swept
with
a
little
soft
sigh
across
the
grave
the
wrapped
me
in
with
fragrance
thick
as
incense
the
tiny
sparrow
turned
her
soft
eyes
at
me
over
the
edge
of
the
nest
and
chirped
contentedly
the
blessed
sunshine
talked
with
me
as
it
touched
the
edges
of
the
to
fire
i
can
not
write
it
even
here
how
these
things
stole
into
my
heart
and
hushed
me
if
i
had
seen
him
standing
by
the
stainless
cross
it
would
not
have
frightened
or
surprised
me
there
not
dead
or
gone
but
it
helps
me
and
makes
me
strong
mamie
little
mamie
o
roy
i
will
try
to
bear
it
all
if
you
will
only
stay
viii
may
the
nearer
the
time
has
come
for
aunt
winifred
to
go
the
more
it
has
seemed
impossible
to
part
with
her
i
have
run
away
from
the
thought
like
a
craven
till
she
made
me
face
it
this
morning
by
saying
decidedly
that
she
should
go
on
the
first
of
the
week
i
dropped
my
sewing
the
tipped
over
and
all
my
spools
rolled
away
under
the
chairs
i
had
a
little
time
to
think
while
i
was
picking
them
up
there
is
the
rest
of
my
visit
at
norwich
to
be
made
you
know
she
said
and
while
i
am
there
i
shall
form
some
definite
plans
for
the
summer
i
have
hardly
decided
what
yet
i
had
better
leave
here
by
the
seven
o
clock
train
if
such
an
early
start
will
not
incommode
i
wound
up
the
last
spool
and
turned
away
to
the
window
there
was
a
confused
dreary
sky
of
scurrying
clouds
and
a
cold
wind
was
bruising
the
i
hate
a
cold
wind
in
may
it
made
me
choke
a
little
thinking
how
i
should
sit
and
listen
to
it
after
she
was
gone
of
the
old
blank
comfortless
days
that
must
come
and
go
of
what
she
had
brought
and
what
she
would
take
away
i
was
a
bit
faint
i
think
for
a
minute
i
had
not
really
thought
the
prospect
through
before
mary
she
said
what
s
the
matter
come
i
went
over
and
she
drew
me
into
her
lap
and
i
put
my
arms
about
her
neck
i
can
bear
it
said
i
and
that
is
the
she
smiled
but
her
smile
faded
when
she
looked
at
me
and
then
i
told
her
sobbing
how
it
was
that
i
could
not
go
into
my
future
alone
i
could
not
do
it
that
she
did
not
know
how
weak
i
was
and
reckless
and
wicked
that
she
did
not
know
what
she
had
been
to
me
i
begged
her
not
to
leave
me
i
begged
her
to
stay
and
help
me
bear
my
life
my
dear
you
are
as
bad
as
faith
when
i
put
her
to
bed
but
i
said
when
faith
cries
you
go
to
her
you
are
you
quite
in
earnest
mary
she
asked
after
a
pause
you
don
t
know
very
much
about
me
after
all
and
there
is
the
child
it
is
always
an
experiment
bringing
two
families
into
lifelong
relations
under
one
roof
if
i
could
think
it
best
you
might
repent
your
am
not
a
family
i
said
feebly
trying
to
laugh
aunt
winifred
if
you
and
faith
only
make
this
your
home
i
can
never
thank
you
never
i
shall
be
entertaining
my
good
angels
and
that
is
the
whole
of
i
have
had
some
thought
of
not
going
back
she
said
at
last
in
a
low
constrained
voice
as
if
she
were
touching
something
that
gave
her
great
pain
for
faith
s
sake
i
should
like
to
educate
her
in
new
england
if
i
had
intended
if
we
stayed
to
rent
or
buy
a
little
home
of
our
own
somewhere
but
i
had
been
putting
off
a
decision
we
are
most
weak
and
most
selfish
sometimes
when
we
think
ourselves
strongest
and
noblest
mary
i
love
my
husband
s
people
i
think
they
love
me
i
was
almost
happy
with
them
it
seemed
as
if
i
were
carrying
on
his
work
for
him
that
was
so
pleasant
she
put
me
down
out
of
her
arms
and
walked
across
the
room
i
will
think
the
matter
over
she
said
by
and
by
in
her
natural
tones
and
let
you
know
she
went
away
up
stairs
then
and
i
did
not
see
her
again
until
i
sent
faith
up
with
her
dinner
and
tea
judging
that
she
would
rather
see
the
child
than
me
i
observed
when
the
dishes
came
down
that
she
had
touched
nothing
but
a
cup
of
coffee
i
began
to
understand
as
i
sat
alone
in
the
parlor
through
the
afternoon
how
much
i
had
asked
of
her
in
my
selfish
distress
at
losing
her
i
had
not
thought
of
that
faces
that
her
husband
loved
meadows
and
hills
and
sunsets
that
he
has
watched
the
home
where
his
last
step
sounded
and
his
last
word
was
spoken
the
grave
where
she
has
laid
him
this
last
more
than
all
call
after
her
and
cling
to
her
with
yearning
closeness
to
leave
them
is
to
leave
the
last
faint
shadow
of
her
beautiful
past
it
hurts
but
she
is
too
brave
to
cry
out
tea
was
over
and
faith
in
bed
but
still
she
did
not
come
down
i
was
sitting
by
the
window
watching
a
little
crescent
moon
climb
over
the
hills
and
wondering
whether
i
had
better
go
up
when
she
came
in
and
stood
behind
me
and
said
attempting
to
laugh
very
impolite
in
me
to
run
off
so
wasn
t
it
cowardly
too
i
think
well
mary
well
auntie
have
you
not
repented
your
proposition
yet
you
would
excel
as
an
inquisitor
forceythe
then
it
shall
be
as
you
say
as
long
as
you
want
us
you
shall
have
us
faith
and
i
turned
to
thank
her
but
could
not
when
i
saw
her
face
it
was
very
pale
there
was
something
inexpressibly
sad
about
her
mouth
and
her
eyelids
drooped
heavily
like
one
weary
from
a
great
struggle
feeling
for
the
moment
guilty
and
ashamed
before
her
as
if
i
had
done
her
wrong
it
is
going
to
be
very
hard
for
you
i
said
never
mind
about
that
she
answered
quickly
we
will
not
talk
about
that
i
knew
though
i
did
not
to
know
that
it
was
best
for
faith
your
hands
about
my
neck
have
settled
it
where
the
work
is
there
the
laborer
must
be
it
is
quite
plain
now
i
have
been
talking
it
over
with
them
all
the
afternoon
it
seems
to
be
what
they
with
i
started
at
the
words
who
had
been
in
her
lonely
chamber
ah
it
is
simply
real
to
her
who
indeed
but
her
saviour
and
her
husband
she
did
not
seem
inclined
to
talk
and
stole
away
from
me
presently
and
out
of
doors
she
was
wrapped
in
her
blanket
shawl
and
had
thrown
a
shimmering
white
hood
over
her
gray
hair
i
wondered
where
she
could
be
going
and
sat
still
at
the
window
watching
her
she
opened
and
shut
the
gate
softly
and
turning
her
face
towards
the
churchyard
walked
up
the
street
and
out
of
my
sight
she
feels
nearer
to
him
in
the
of
the
dead
her
heart
cries
after
the
grave
by
which
she
will
never
sit
and
weep
again
on
which
she
will
never
plant
the
roses
any
more
as
i
sat
watching
and
thinking
this
the
faint
light
struck
her
slight
figure
and
little
shimmering
hood
again
and
she
walked
down
the
street
and
in
with
steady
step
when
she
came
up
and
stood
beside
me
smiling
with
the
light
knitted
thing
thrown
back
on
her
shoulders
her
face
seemed
to
rise
from
it
as
from
a
snowy
cloud
and
for
her
look
i
wish
raphael
could
have
had
it
for
one
of
his
rapt
madonnas
now
mary
she
said
with
the
sparkle
back
again
in
her
voice
i
am
ready
to
be
entertaining
and
promise
not
to
play
the
hermit
again
very
soon
shall
i
sit
here
on
the
sofa
with
you
yes
my
dear
i
am
happy
quite
so
then
we
took
this
new
promise
of
home
that
has
come
to
make
my
life
if
not
joyful
something
less
than
desolate
and
analyzed
it
in
its
practical
bearings
what
a
pity
that
all
pretty
dreams
have
to
be
analyzed
i
had
some
notion
about
throwing
our
little
incomes
into
a
joint
family
fund
but
she
put
a
veto
to
that
i
suppose
because
mine
is
the
larger
she
prefers
to
take
board
for
herself
and
faith
but
if
i
know
myself
she
shall
never
be
suffered
to
have
the
feeling
of
a
boarder
and
i
will
make
her
so
much
at
home
in
my
house
that
she
shall
not
remember
that
it
is
not
her
own
her
visit
to
norwich
she
has
decided
to
put
off
until
the
autumn
so
that
i
shall
have
her
to
myself
undisturbed
all
summer
i
have
been
looking
at
roy
s
picture
a
long
time
and
wondering
how
he
would
like
the
new
plan
i
said
something
of
the
sort
to
her
why
put
any
would
in
that
sentence
she
said
smiling
it
belongs
in
the
present
then
i
am
sure
he
likes
it
i
answered
he
likes
it
and
i
said
the
words
over
till
i
was
ready
to
cry
for
rest
in
their
sweet
sound
it
is
roy
s
birthday
but
i
have
not
spoken
of
it
we
used
to
make
a
great
deal
of
these
little
festivals
but
it
is
of
no
use
to
write
about
that
i
am
afraid
i
have
been
bearing
it
very
badly
all
day
she
noticed
my
face
but
said
nothing
till
mrs
bland
was
down
stairs
and
i
had
come
away
alone
up
here
in
the
dark
i
heard
her
asking
for
me
but
would
not
go
down
by
and
by
aunt
winifred
knocked
and
i
let
her
in
mrs
bland
can
not
understand
why
you
don
t
see
her
mary
she
said
gently
you
know
you
have
not
thanked
her
for
those
english
violets
that
she
sent
the
other
day
i
only
thought
i
would
remind
you
she
might
feel
a
little
i
can
t
not
aunt
winifred
you
must
excuse
me
to
her
somehow
i
don
t
want
to
go
is
it
that
you
don
t
want
to
or
it
that
you
can
t
she
said
in
that
gentle
motherly
way
of
hers
at
which
i
can
never
take
offence
mary
i
wonder
if
roy
would
not
a
little
rather
that
you
would
go
down
it
might
have
been
roy
himself
who
spoke
i
went
down
ix
june
aunt
winifred
went
to
the
office
this
morning
and
met
dr
bland
who
walked
home
with
her
he
always
likes
to
talk
with
her
a
woman
who
knows
something
about
fate
and
foreknowledge
absolute
who
is
not
ignorant
of
politics
and
talks
intelligently
of
agassiz
s
latest
fossil
who
can
understand
a
german
quotation
and
has
heard
of
strauss
and
neander
who
can
dash
her
sprightliness
ably
against
his
old
dry
bones
of
metaphysics
and
theology
yet
never
speak
an
accent
above
that
essentially
womanly
voice
of
hers
is
i
imagine
a
phenomenon
in
his
social
experience
i
was
sitting
at
the
window
when
they
came
up
and
stopped
at
the
gate
dr
bland
lifted
his
hat
to
me
in
his
grave
way
talking
the
while
somewhat
eagerly
too
i
could
see
aunt
winifred
answered
him
with
a
peculiar
smile
and
a
few
low
words
that
i
could
not
hear
but
my
dear
madam
he
said
the
glory
of
god
you
see
the
glory
of
god
is
the
primary
but
the
glory
of
god
these
lesser
glories
as
a
sidereal
system
though
a
splendid
whole
exists
by
the
multiplied
differing
of
one
star
from
another
star
ah
dr
bland
you
make
a
grand
abstraction
out
of
it
but
it
makes
me
cold
she
shivered
half
playfully
half
involuntarily
it
makes
me
cold
i
am
very
much
alive
and
human
and
christ
was
human
she
came
in
smiling
a
little
sadly
and
stood
by
me
watching
the
minister
walk
over
the
hill
how
much
does
that
man
love
his
wife
and
children
she
asked
abruptly
a
good
deal
why
i
am
afraid
that
he
will
lose
one
of
them
then
before
many
more
years
of
his
life
are
what
he
hasn
t
been
telling
you
that
they
are
consumptive
or
anything
of
the
sort
o
dear
me
no
with
a
merry
laugh
which
died
quickly
away
i
was
only
thinking
there
is
trouble
in
store
for
him
some
intense
pain
if
he
is
capable
of
intense
pain
which
shall
shake
his
cold
smooth
theorizing
to
the
foundation
he
speaks
a
foreign
tongue
when
he
talks
of
bereavement
of
death
of
the
future
life
no
argument
could
convince
him
of
that
though
which
is
the
worst
of
he
must
think
you
shockingly
i
don
t
doubt
it
we
had
a
little
talk
this
morning
and
he
regarded
me
with
an
expression
of
mingled
consternation
and
perplexity
that
was
curious
he
is
a
very
good
man
he
is
not
a
stupid
man
i
only
wish
that
he
would
stop
preaching
and
teaching
things
that
he
knows
nothing
about
he
is
only
drifting
with
the
tide
though
she
added
in
his
views
of
this
matter
in
our
recoil
from
the
materialism
of
the
romish
church
we
have
it
seems
to
me
nearly
stranded
ourselves
on
the
opposite
shore
just
as
in
a
rebound
from
the
spirit
which
would
put
our
saviour
on
a
level
with
buddha
or
mahomet
we
have
been
in
danger
of
forgetting
to
begin
as
the
bible
begins
with
his
humanity
it
is
the
grandeur
of
inspiration
that
it
knows
how
to
it
had
been
in
my
mind
for
several
days
to
ask
aunt
winifred
something
and
feeling
in
the
mood
i
made
her
take
off
her
things
and
devote
herself
to
me
my
question
concerned
what
we
call
the
intermediate
i
have
been
expecting
that
she
said
what
about
it
what
it
life
and
we
do
not
go
to
sleep
of
i
believe
that
notion
is
about
exploded
though
clear
thinkers
like
whately
have
appeared
to
advocate
it
where
it
originated
i
do
not
know
unless
from
the
frequent
comparisons
in
the
scriptures
of
death
with
sleep
which
refer
solely
i
am
convinced
to
the
condition
of
body
and
which
are
voted
down
by
an
overwhelming
majority
of
decided
statements
relative
to
the
consciousness
happiness
and
tangibility
of
the
life
into
which
we
immediately
it
is
intermediate
in
some
sense
i
it
waits
between
two
other
conditions
yes
i
think
the
drift
of
what
we
are
taught
about
it
leads
to
that
conclusion
i
expect
to
become
at
once
sinless
but
to
have
a
broader
christian
character
many
years
hence
to
be
happy
at
once
but
to
be
happier
by
and
by
to
find
in
myself
wonderful
new
tastes
and
capacities
which
are
to
be
immeasurably
ennobled
and
enlarged
after
the
resurrection
whatever
that
may
what
does
it
mean
i
know
no
more
than
you
but
you
shall
hear
what
i
think
presently
i
was
going
to
say
that
this
seems
to
be
plain
enough
in
the
bible
the
angels
took
lazarus
at
once
to
abraham
dives
seems
to
have
found
no
interval
between
death
and
consciousness
of
they
always
tell
you
that
that
is
only
a
but
it
must
mean
no
story
in
the
bible
has
been
pulled
to
pieces
and
twisted
about
as
that
has
been
we
are
in
danger
of
pulling
and
twisting
all
sense
out
of
it
then
judas
having
hanged
his
wretched
self
went
to
his
own
place
besides
there
was
christ
s
promise
to
the
i
told
her
that
i
had
heard
dr
bland
say
that
we
could
not
place
much
dependence
on
that
passage
because
paradise
did
not
necessarily
mean
heaven
but
it
meant
living
thinking
enjoying
for
thou
shalt
with
paul
s
beautiful
perplexed
revery
however
would
be
enough
if
it
stood
alone
for
he
did
not
know
whether
he
would
rather
stay
in
this
world
or
depart
and
be
with
christ
which
is
far
better
you
see
and
his
three
mysterious
days
which
typify
our
intermediate
state
were
over
then
and
he
had
ascended
to
his
father
would
it
be
far
better
either
to
leave
this
actual
tangible
life
throbbing
with
hopes
and
passions
to
leave
its
busy
working
its
quiet
joys
its
very
sorrows
which
are
near
and
human
for
a
nap
of
several
ages
or
even
for
a
vague
lazy
disembodied
existence
disembodied
i
supposed
of
course
that
it
was
i
do
not
think
so
and
that
brings
us
to
the
resurrection
all
the
of
revelation
is
to
show
that
an
embodied
state
is
superior
to
a
disembodied
one
yet
certainly
we
who
love
god
are
promised
that
death
will
lead
us
into
a
condition
which
shall
have
the
advantage
of
this
for
the
good
apostle
to
die
was
i
don
t
believe
for
instance
that
adam
and
eve
have
been
wandering
about
in
a
misty
condition
all
these
thousands
of
years
i
suspect
that
we
have
some
sort
of
body
immediately
after
passing
out
of
this
but
that
there
is
to
come
a
mysterious
change
equivalent
perhaps
to
a
when
our
capacities
for
action
will
be
greatly
improved
and
that
in
some
manner
this
new
form
will
be
connected
with
this
garment
by
the
soul
laid
deacon
quirk
expects
to
rise
in
his
own
entire
original
body
after
it
has
lain
in
the
first
church
cemetery
a
proper
number
of
years
under
a
black
slate
headstone
adorned
by
a
willow
and
such
a
cherubim
as
that
poor
boy
shot
by
the
way
if
i
ve
laughed
at
that
story
once
i
have
fifty
perhaps
deacon
quirk
would
admire
a
work
of
art
that
i
found
stowed
away
on
the
top
of
your
uncle
calvin
s
bookcases
it
was
an
old
woodcut
nobody
knows
how
old
of
an
interesting
skeleton
rising
from
his
grave
and
in
a
sprightly
and
modest
manner
drawing
on
his
skin
while
gabriel
with
apoplectic
cheeks
feet
uppermost
in
the
air
was
blowing
a
tin
trumpet
in
his
ear
no
some
of
the
popular
notions
of
resurrection
are
simple
physiological
impossibilities
from
causes
too
tedious
to
imagine
for
instance
the
resurrection
of
two
hottentots
one
of
whom
has
happened
to
make
a
dinner
of
the
other
some
fine
day
a
little
complication
there
or
picture
the
touching
scene
when
that
devoted
husband
king
mausolas
whose
widow
had
him
burned
and
ate
the
ashes
should
feel
moved
to
institute
a
search
for
his
body
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
infidel
argument
has
the
best
of
it
when
we
attempt
to
enforce
a
natural
impossibility
it
is
worth
while
to
remember
that
paul
expressly
stated
that
we
shall
rise
in
our
entire
earthly
bodies
the
simile
which
he
used
is
the
seed
sown
dying
in
and
mingling
with
the
ground
how
many
of
its
original
particles
are
found
in
the
corn
yet
you
believe
that
belonging
to
this
body
is
preserved
for
the
completion
of
another
certainly
i
accept
god
s
statement
about
it
which
is
as
plain
as
words
can
make
a
statement
i
do
not
know
and
i
do
not
care
to
know
how
it
is
to
be
effected
god
will
not
be
at
a
loss
for
a
way
any
more
than
he
is
at
a
loss
for
a
way
to
make
his
fields
blossom
every
spring
for
aught
we
know
some
invisible
compound
of
an
annihilated
body
may
hover
by
a
divine
decree
around
the
site
of
death
till
it
is
wanted
sufficient
to
preserve
identity
as
strictly
as
a
body
can
ever
be
said
to
preserve
it
and
stranger
things
have
happened
you
remember
the
old
mohammedan
belief
in
the
one
little
bone
which
is
imperishable
bush
s
idea
of
our
triune
existence
is
suggestive
for
a
notion
he
believed
you
know
that
it
takes
a
material
body
a
spiritual
body
and
a
soul
to
make
a
man
the
spiritual
body
is
enclosed
within
the
material
the
soul
within
the
spiritual
death
is
simply
the
slipping
off
of
the
outer
body
as
a
husk
slips
off
from
its
kernel
the
deathless
frame
stands
ready
then
for
the
soul
s
untrammelled
occupation
but
it
is
a
waste
of
time
to
speculate
over
such
useless
fancies
while
so
many
remain
that
will
vitally
affect
our
it
is
singular
but
i
never
gave
a
serious
thought
and
i
have
done
some
thinking
about
other
matters
to
my
heavenly
body
till
that
moment
while
i
sat
listening
to
her
in
fact
till
roy
went
the
future
was
a
miserable
mysterious
blank
to
be
drawn
on
and
on
in
eternal
and
joyless
monotony
and
to
which
at
times
annihilation
seemed
preferable
i
remember
when
i
was
a
child
asking
father
once
if
i
were
so
good
that
i
to
go
to
heaven
whether
after
a
hundred
years
god
would
not
let
me
die
more
or
less
of
the
disposition
of
that
same
desperate
little
sinner
i
suspect
has
always
clung
to
me
so
i
asked
aunt
winifred
in
some
perplexity
what
she
supposed
our
bodies
would
be
like
it
must
be
nearly
all
suppose
she
said
for
we
are
nowhere
definitely
told
but
this
is
certain
they
will
be
as
real
as
but
these
you
can
see
you
can
what
would
be
the
use
of
having
a
body
that
you
can
t
see
and
touch
a
body
is
a
not
a
spirit
why
should
you
not
having
seen
roy
s
old
smile
and
heard
his
own
voice
clasp
his
hand
again
and
feel
his
kiss
on
your
happy
lips
it
is
really
amusing
she
continued
to
sum
up
the
notions
that
good
people
excellent
people
even
thinking
people
have
of
the
heavenly
body
vague
visions
of
floating
about
in
the
clouds
of
balancing
with
a
white
robe
on
perhaps
in
stiff
rows
about
a
throne
like
the
angels
in
the
old
pictures
converging
to
an
apex
or
ranged
in
like
so
many
marbles
murillo
has
one
charming
exception
i
always
take
a
secret
delight
in
that
little
cherub
of
his
kicking
the
clouds
in
the
upper
corner
of
the
immaculate
conception
he
seems
to
be
having
a
good
time
of
it
in
genuine
the
truth
is
that
the
ordinary
idea
if
sifted
accurately
reduces
our
eternal
personality
to
isaac
taylor
holds
that
as
far
as
the
abstract
idea
of
spirit
is
concerned
it
may
just
as
reasonably
be
granite
as
ether
mrs
charles
says
a
pretty
thing
about
this
she
thinks
these
angels
very
unsatisfactory
beings
and
that
the
heart
returns
with
loving
obstinacy
to
the
young
men
in
long
white
garments
who
sat
waiting
in
the
sepulchre
here
again
i
cling
to
my
conjecture
about
the
word
angel
for
then
we
should
learn
emphatically
something
about
our
future
selves
as
the
angels
in
heaven
or
equal
unto
the
angels
we
are
told
in
another
place
that
may
mean
simply
what
it
says
at
least
if
we
are
to
resemble
them
in
the
particular
respect
of
which
the
words
were
spoken
and
that
one
of
the
most
important
which
could
well
be
selected
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
infer
that
we
shall
resemble
them
in
others
in
the
resurrection
by
the
way
means
in
that
connection
and
in
many
others
simply
future
state
of
existence
without
any
reference
to
the
time
at
which
the
great
bodily
change
is
to
come
but
this
is
a
digression
as
the
novelists
say
i
was
going
to
say
that
it
bewilders
me
to
conjecture
where
students
of
the
bible
have
discovered
the
usual
foggy
nonsense
about
the
corporeity
of
heaven
if
there
is
anything
laid
down
in
plain
statement
devoid
of
metaphor
or
parable
simple
and
unequivocal
it
is
the
definite
contradiction
of
all
that
paul
in
his
preface
to
that
sublime
apostrophe
to
death
repeats
and
reiterates
it
lest
we
should
make
a
mistake
in
his
meaning
there
are
celestial
it
is
raised
a
spiritual
there
is
a
spiritual
it
raised
in
it
raised
in
it
raised
in
moses
too
when
he
came
to
the
transfigured
mount
in
glory
had
as
real
a
as
when
he
went
into
the
lonely
mount
to
but
they
will
be
different
from
these
the
glory
of
the
terrestrial
is
one
the
glory
of
the
celestial
another
take
away
sin
and
sickness
and
misery
and
that
of
itself
would
make
difference
you
do
not
suppose
that
we
shall
look
as
we
look
now
i
certainly
do
at
least
i
think
it
more
than
possible
that
the
human
form
divine
or
something
like
it
is
to
be
retained
not
only
from
the
fact
that
risen
elijah
bore
it
and
moses
who
if
he
had
not
passed
through
his
resurrection
does
not
seem
to
have
looked
different
from
the
other
i
have
to
use
those
two
poor
prophets
on
all
occasions
but
as
we
are
told
of
them
neither
by
parable
nor
picture
they
are
important
and
that
angels
never
appeared
in
any
other
but
because
in
sinless
eden
god
chose
it
for
adam
and
eve
what
came
in
unmarred
beauty
direct
from
his
hand
can
not
be
unworthy
of
his
other
paradise
beyond
the
it
would
chime
in
pleasantly
too
with
the
idea
of
redemption
that
our
very
bodies
free
from
all
the
distortion
of
guilt
shall
return
to
something
akin
to
the
pure
ideal
in
which
he
moulded
them
then
there
is
another
reason
and
what
is
that
the
human
form
has
been
borne
and
dignified
forever
by
christ
and
further
than
that
he
ascended
to
his
father
in
it
and
lives
there
in
it
as
human
god
i
had
never
thought
of
that
and
said
so
yes
with
the
very
feet
which
trod
the
dusty
road
to
emmaus
the
very
wounded
hands
which
thomas
touched
believing
the
very
lips
which
ate
of
the
broiled
fish
and
honeycomb
the
very
voice
which
murmured
mary
in
the
garden
and
which
told
her
that
he
ascended
unto
his
father
and
her
father
to
his
god
and
her
god
he
was
parted
from
them
and
was
received
up
into
his
death
and
resurrection
stand
forever
the
great
prototype
of
ours
otherwise
what
is
the
meaning
of
such
statements
as
these
when
he
shall
appear
we
shall
be
the
first
man
adam
is
of
the
earth
the
second
man
is
the
lord
as
we
have
borne
the
image
of
the
earthy
shall
also
bear
the
image
of
the
and
what
of
this
when
we
are
told
that
our
vile
bodies
being
changed
shall
be
fashioned
unto
his
glorious
i
asked
her
if
she
inferred
from
that
that
we
should
have
just
such
bodies
as
the
freedom
from
pain
and
sin
would
make
of
these
flesh
and
blood
can
not
inherit
the
kingdom
she
said
there
is
no
escaping
that
even
if
i
had
the
smallest
desire
to
escape
it
which
i
have
not
whatever
is
essentially
earthly
and
temporary
in
the
arrangements
of
this
world
will
be
out
of
place
and
unnecessary
there
earthly
and
temporary
flesh
and
blood
certainly
christ
said
a
spirit
hath
not
flesh
and
bones
as
ye
see
me
a
hath
not
and
who
ever
said
that
it
did
his
body
had
something
that
appeared
like
them
certainly
that
passage
by
the
way
has
led
some
ingenious
writer
on
the
chemistry
of
heaven
to
infer
that
our
bodies
there
will
be
like
these
minus
i
don
t
propose
to
spend
my
time
over
such
investigations
summing
up
the
meaning
of
the
story
of
those
last
days
before
the
ascension
and
granting
the
shade
of
mystery
which
hangs
over
them
i
gather
this
that
the
spiritual
body
is
real
is
tangible
is
visible
is
human
but
that
we
shall
be
some
indefinable
but
thorough
change
had
come
over
him
he
could
withdraw
himself
from
the
recognition
of
mary
and
from
the
disciples
whose
eyes
were
holden
as
it
pleased
him
he
came
and
went
through
barred
and
bolted
doors
he
appeared
suddenly
in
a
certain
place
without
sound
of
footstep
or
flutter
of
garment
to
announce
his
approach
he
vanished
and
was
not
like
a
cloud
new
and
wonderful
powers
had
been
given
to
him
of
which
probably
his
little
bewildered
group
of
friends
saw
but
a
few
and
he
was
yet
he
was
jesus
of
nazareth
until
the
sorrowful
drama
of
human
life
that
he
had
taken
upon
himself
was
thoroughly
finished
from
manger
to
sepulchre
and
from
sepulchre
to
the
right
hand
of
his
i
like
to
wonder
she
said
presently
what
we
are
going
to
look
like
and
be
like
in
the
first
place
it
is
i
myself
christ
said
then
to
be
perfectly
well
never
a
sense
of
pain
or
weakness
imagine
how
much
solid
comfort
if
one
had
no
other
in
being
forever
rid
of
all
the
ills
that
flesh
is
heir
to
beautiful
too
i
suppose
we
shall
be
every
one
have
you
never
had
that
come
over
you
with
a
thrill
of
compassionate
thankfulness
when
you
have
seen
a
poor
girl
shrinking
as
only
girls
can
shrink
under
the
affliction
of
a
marred
face
or
form
the
loss
or
presence
of
beauty
is
not
as
slight
a
deprivation
or
blessing
as
the
moralists
would
make
it
out
your
grandmother
who
was
the
most
beautiful
woman
i
ever
saw
the
belle
of
the
county
all
her
young
days
and
the
model
for
artists
fancy
sketching
even
in
her
old
ones
as
modest
as
a
violet
and
as
honest
as
the
sunshine
used
to
have
the
prettiest
little
way
when
we
girls
were
in
our
teens
and
she
thought
that
we
must
be
lectured
a
bit
on
youthful
vanity
of
adding
in
her
quiet
voice
smoothing
down
her
black
silk
apron
as
she
spoke
but
still
it
is
a
thing
to
be
thankful
for
my
dear
to
have
a
but
to
return
to
the
track
and
our
future
bodies
we
shall
find
them
vastly
convenient
undoubtedly
with
powers
of
which
there
is
no
dreaming
perhaps
they
will
be
so
one
with
the
soul
that
to
will
will
be
to
do
hindrance
out
of
the
question
i
for
instance
sitting
here
by
you
and
thinking
that
i
should
like
to
be
in
kansas
would
be
there
there
is
an
interesting
bit
of
a
hint
in
daniel
about
gabriel
who
being
caused
to
fly
swiftly
touched
him
about
the
time
of
the
evening
but
do
you
not
make
a
very
material
kind
of
heaven
out
of
such
suppositions
it
depends
upon
what
you
mean
by
the
term
does
not
to
my
thinking
imply
degradation
except
so
far
as
it
is
associated
with
sin
chalmers
has
the
right
of
it
when
he
talks
about
he
says
in
his
sermon
on
the
new
heavens
and
earth
which
by
the
way
you
should
read
and
from
which
i
wish
a
few
more
of
our
preachers
would
learn
something
that
we
forget
that
on
the
birth
of
materialism
when
it
stood
out
in
the
freshness
of
those
glories
which
the
great
architect
of
nature
had
impressed
upon
it
that
then
the
morning
stars
sang
together
and
all
the
sons
of
god
shouted
for
i
do
not
believe
in
a
heaven
but
i
believe
in
a
we
have
been
devoting
ourselves
to
feminine
vanities
all
day
out
in
the
orchard
aunt
winifred
has
been
making
her
summer
bonnet
and
i
some
linen
collars
i
saw
though
she
said
nothing
that
she
thought
the
a
little
gloomy
and
i
am
going
to
wear
these
in
the
mornings
to
please
her
she
has
an
accumulation
of
work
on
hand
and
in
the
afternoon
i
offered
to
tuck
a
little
dress
for
faith
the
prettiest
pink
affair
pale
as
a
blush
rose
and
about
as
delicate
faith
who
had
been
making
in
the
swamp
and
was
spattered
with
black
peat
from
curls
to
stockings
looked
on
approvingly
and
wanted
it
to
wear
on
a
expedition
it
seemed
to
do
me
good
to
do
something
for
somebody
after
all
this
lonely
and
i
suspect
selfish
idleness
i
read
a
little
of
chalmers
and
went
laughing
to
aunt
winifred
with
the
first
sentence
there
is
a
limit
to
the
revelations
of
the
bible
about
futurity
and
it
were
a
mental
or
spiritual
trespass
to
go
beyond
ah
but
she
said
look
a
little
farther
and
i
read
but
while
we
attempt
not
to
be
wise
above
that
which
is
written
we
should
attempt
and
that
most
studiously
to
be
wise
to
that
which
is
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
was
a
noticeable
fact
that
among
all
the
visits
of
angels
to
this
world
of
which
we
are
told
no
one
seems
to
have
discovered
in
any
the
presence
of
a
dead
friend
if
redeemed
men
are
subject
to
the
same
laws
as
they
why
did
such
a
thing
never
happen
i
asked
aunt
winifred
and
she
said
that
the
question
reminded
her
of
augustine
s
lonely
cry
thirty
years
after
the
death
of
monica
ah
the
dead
do
not
come
back
for
had
it
been
possible
there
has
not
been
a
night
when
i
should
not
have
seen
my
mother
there
seemed
to
be
two
reasons
she
said
why
there
should
be
no
exceptions
to
the
law
of
silence
imposed
between
us
and
those
who
have
left
us
one
of
which
was
that
we
should
be
overpowered
with
familiar
curiosity
about
them
which
nobody
seems
to
have
dared
to
express
in
the
presence
of
angels
and
the
secrets
of
their
life
god
has
decreed
that
it
is
unlawful
to
utter
but
lazarus
and
jairus
s
little
daughter
and
the
dead
raised
at
the
crucifixion
what
of
them
i
asked
i
can
not
help
conjecturing
that
they
were
suffered
to
forget
their
glimpse
of
spiritual
life
she
said
since
their
resurrection
was
a
miracle
there
might
be
a
miracle
throughout
at
least
their
lips
must
have
been
sealed
for
not
a
word
of
their
testimony
has
been
saved
when
lazarus
dined
with
simon
after
he
had
come
back
to
life
and
of
that
feast
we
have
a
minute
account
in
i
believe
every
gospel
nobody
seems
to
have
asked
or
he
to
have
answered
any
questions
about
it
the
other
reason
is
a
sorrowfully
sufficient
one
it
is
that
lost
darling
has
not
gone
to
heaven
of
all
the
mercies
that
our
father
has
given
this
blessed
uncertainty
this
long
unbroken
silence
may
be
the
dearest
bitterly
hard
for
you
and
me
but
what
are
thousands
like
you
and
me
weighed
against
one
who
stands
beside
a
hopeless
grave
think
a
minute
what
mourners
there
have
been
and
they
have
mourned
ponder
one
such
solitary
instance
as
that
of
vittoria
colonna
wondering
through
her
widowed
years
if
she
could
ever
be
good
enough
to
join
wicked
pescara
in
another
world
this
poor
earth
holds
god
only
knows
how
many
god
make
them
very
few
vittorias
ah
mary
what
right
have
we
to
complain
aunt
winifred
had
callers
quirk
and
o
homer
aristocracy
the
butcher
s
wife
and
it
fell
to
my
lot
to
put
faith
to
bed
the
little
maiden
seriously
demurred
cousin
mary
was
very
good
o
yes
she
was
good
enough
but
her
mamma
was
a
great
deal
gooder
and
why
couldn
t
little
peoples
sit
up
till
nine
o
clock
as
well
as
big
peoples
she
should
like
to
know
finally
she
came
to
the
gracious
conclusion
that
perhaps
i
d
made
me
carry
her
all
the
way
up
stairs
and
dropped
like
a
little
lump
of
lead
half
asleep
on
my
shoulder
before
two
buttons
were
unfastened
feeling
under
some
sort
of
theological
obligation
to
hear
her
say
her
prayers
i
pulled
her
curls
a
little
till
she
awoke
and
went
through
with
now
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
i
pway
ve
lord
triumphantly
i
supposed
that
was
the
end
but
it
seems
that
she
has
been
also
taught
the
lord
s
prayer
which
she
gave
me
promptly
to
understand
o
see
here
that
isn
t
all
i
can
say
our
father
and
you
ve
got
to
help
me
a
lot
this
very
soon
became
a
proposition
but
by
our
united
efforts
we
managed
after
tribulations
manifold
to
arrive
successfully
at
for
ever
n
ever
n
ever
n
dear
me
she
said
jumping
up
with
a
yawn
i
think
that
s
a
don
t
you
cousin
mary
now
i
must
kiss
mamma
good
night
she
announced
when
she
was
tucked
up
at
last
but
mamma
kissed
you
good
night
before
you
came
o
so
she
did
yes
i
member
well
it
s
papa
i
ve
got
to
kiss
i
knew
there
was
i
looked
at
her
in
perplexity
why
there
she
said
in
the
upper
drawer
my
pretty
little
papa
in
a
purple
frame
don
t
you
know
i
went
to
the
and
found
in
a
case
of
velvet
a
small
ivory
painting
of
her
father
this
i
brought
wondering
and
the
child
took
it
reverently
and
kissed
the
pictured
lips
faith
i
said
as
i
laid
it
softly
back
do
you
always
do
this
do
what
kiss
papa
good
night
o
yes
i
ve
done
that
ever
since
i
was
a
little
girl
you
know
i
guess
i
ve
always
kissed
him
pretty
much
when
i
m
a
naughty
girl
he
feels
sorry
he
s
gone
to
heaven
i
like
him
o
yes
and
then
when
i
m
through
kissing
mamma
kisses
him
june
i
was
in
her
room
this
afternoon
while
she
was
dressing
i
like
to
watch
her
brush
her
beautiful
gray
hair
it
quite
alters
her
face
to
have
it
down
it
seems
to
shrine
her
in
like
a
cloud
and
the
outlines
of
her
cheeks
round
out
and
she
grows
young
i
used
to
be
proud
of
my
hair
when
i
was
a
girl
she
said
with
a
slight
blush
as
she
saw
me
looking
at
her
it
was
all
i
had
to
be
vain
of
and
i
made
the
most
of
it
ah
well
i
was
three
years
ago
o
you
regular
old
woman
she
added
smiling
at
herself
in
the
mirror
as
she
twisted
the
silver
coils
flashing
through
her
fingers
well
when
i
am
in
heaven
i
shall
have
my
pretty
brown
hair
it
seemed
odd
enough
to
hear
that
then
the
next
minute
it
did
not
seem
odd
at
all
but
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
june
she
said
nothing
to
me
about
the
anniversary
and
though
it
has
been
in
my
thoughts
all
the
time
i
said
nothing
to
her
i
thought
that
she
would
shut
herself
up
for
the
day
and
was
rather
surprised
that
she
was
about
as
usual
busily
at
work
chatting
with
me
and
playing
with
faith
just
after
tea
she
went
away
alone
for
a
time
and
came
back
a
little
quiet
but
that
was
all
i
was
for
some
reason
impressed
with
the
feeling
that
she
kept
the
day
in
memory
not
so
much
as
the
day
of
her
mourning
as
of
his
release
longing
to
do
something
for
her
yet
not
knowing
what
to
do
i
went
into
the
garden
while
she
was
away
and
finding
some
carnations
that
shone
like
stars
in
the
dying
light
i
gathered
them
all
and
took
them
to
her
room
and
filling
my
tiny
porphyry
vase
left
them
on
the
bracket
under
the
photograph
of
uncle
forceythe
that
hangs
by
the
window
when
she
found
them
she
called
me
and
kissed
me
thank
you
dear
she
said
and
thank
god
too
mary
for
me
that
he
should
have
been
happy
happy
and
out
of
pain
for
three
long
beautiful
years
o
think
of
that
when
i
was
in
her
room
with
the
flowers
i
passed
the
table
on
which
her
little
bible
lay
open
a
mark
of
rich
ribbon
a
black
ribbon
fell
across
the
pages
it
bore
in
silver
text
these
words
shalt
have
no
other
gods
before
i
thank
thee
my
god
the
river
of
lethe
may
indeed
flow
through
the
elysian
fields
it
does
not
water
the
christian
s
aunt
winifred
was
saying
that
over
to
herself
in
a
dreamy
undertone
this
morning
and
i
happened
to
hear
her
just
a
quotation
dear
she
said
smiling
in
answer
to
my
look
of
inquiry
i
couldn
t
originate
so
pretty
a
thing
it
pretty
very
but
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
you
thought
that
forgetfulness
would
be
necessary
to
happiness
why
yes
as
far
as
i
had
ever
thought
about
it
that
is
after
our
last
ties
with
this
world
are
broken
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
i
could
be
happy
to
remember
all
that
i
have
suffered
and
all
that
i
have
sinned
but
the
last
of
all
the
sins
will
be
as
if
it
had
never
been
christ
takes
care
of
that
no
shadow
of
a
sense
of
guilt
can
dog
you
or
affect
your
relations
to
him
or
your
other
friends
the
last
pain
borne
the
last
tear
the
last
sigh
the
last
lonely
hour
the
last
unsatisfied
dream
forever
gone
by
why
should
not
the
dead
past
bury
its
dead
then
why
remember
it
save
but
to
swell
the
sense
of
being
besides
forgetfulness
of
the
disagreeable
things
of
this
life
implies
forgetfulness
of
the
pleasant
ones
they
are
all
tangled
to
be
sure
i
don
t
know
that
i
should
like
of
course
you
wouldn
t
imagine
yourself
in
a
state
of
being
where
you
and
roy
had
lost
your
past
all
that
you
had
borne
and
enjoyed
and
hoped
and
feared
together
the
pretty
little
memories
of
your
babyhood
and
first
at
school
when
he
used
to
trudge
along
beside
you
little
fellow
how
many
times
i
have
watched
him
holding
you
tight
by
the
or
or
bits
of
fat
fingers
lest
you
should
run
away
or
fall
then
the
old
academy
pranks
out
of
which
you
used
to
help
each
other
his
little
chivalry
and
advice
the
mischief
in
his
eyes
some
of
the
talks
the
first
novel
that
you
read
and
dreamed
over
together
the
college
stories
the
chats
over
the
by
firelight
the
earliest
earnest
into
life
together
its
temptations
conquered
its
lessons
learned
its
disappointments
faced
together
always
you
two
would
you
like
to
are
you
to
forget
all
this
roy
might
as
well
be
not
roy
but
a
strange
angel
if
you
should
heaven
will
be
not
less
heaven
but
more
for
this
pleasant
remembering
so
many
other
and
greater
and
happier
memories
will
fill
up
the
time
then
that
after
years
these
things
may
probably
will
seem
smaller
than
it
seems
to
us
now
they
can
ever
be
but
they
will
i
think
be
always
dear
just
as
we
look
back
to
our
with
a
pitying
sort
of
fondness
and
though
the
little
creatures
are
of
small
enough
use
to
us
now
yet
we
like
to
keep
good
friends
with
them
for
old
times
sake
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
and
i
shall
sit
down
some
summer
afternoon
in
heaven
and
talk
over
what
we
have
been
saying
and
laugh
perhaps
at
all
the
poor
little
dreams
we
have
been
dreaming
of
what
has
not
entered
into
the
heart
of
man
you
see
it
is
certain
to
be
so
much
than
anything
that
i
can
think
of
which
is
the
comfort
of
it
and
roy
yes
some
more
about
roy
supposing
he
were
to
come
right
into
the
room
now
and
i
slipped
out
and
you
had
him
all
to
yourself
again
now
dear
don
t
cry
but
wait
a
minute
her
caressing
hand
fell
on
my
hair
i
did
not
mean
to
hurt
you
but
to
say
that
your
first
talk
with
him
after
you
stand
face
to
face
may
be
like
that
remembering
this
life
is
going
to
help
us
amazingly
i
fancy
to
appreciate
the
next
she
added
by
way
of
period
christ
seems
to
have
thought
so
when
he
called
to
the
minds
of
those
happy
people
what
in
that
unconscious
ministering
of
lowly
faith
which
may
never
reap
its
sheaf
in
the
field
where
the
seed
was
sown
they
had
not
had
the
comfort
of
finding
out
before
i
was
sick
and
in
prison
and
ye
visited
and
to
come
again
to
abraham
in
the
parable
did
he
not
say
son
that
thou
in
thy
lifetime
hadst
good
things
and
lazarus
evil
i
wonder
what
it
is
going
to
look
like
i
said
as
soon
as
i
could
put
poor
dives
out
of
my
mind
heaven
eye
hath
not
seen
but
i
have
my
fancies
i
think
i
want
some
mountains
and
very
many
mountains
and
trees
yes
mountains
as
we
see
them
at
sunset
and
sunrise
or
when
the
maples
are
on
fire
and
there
are
clouds
enough
to
make
great
purple
shadows
chase
each
other
into
lakes
of
light
over
the
tops
and
down
the
sides
the
of
mountains
which
we
catch
in
rare
glimpses
as
we
catch
the
ideal
of
everything
trees
as
they
look
when
the
wind
cooes
through
them
on
a
june
afternoon
elms
or
lindens
or
pines
as
cool
as
frost
and
yellow
sunshine
trickling
through
on
moss
trees
in
a
forest
so
thick
that
it
shuts
out
the
world
and
you
walk
like
one
in
a
sanctuary
trees
pierced
by
stars
and
trees
in
a
bath
of
summer
moons
to
which
the
thrill
of
love
s
young
dream
shall
cling
forever
but
there
is
no
end
to
one
s
fancies
some
water
too
i
would
there
shall
be
no
more
perhaps
not
though
as
the
sea
is
the
great
type
of
separation
and
of
destruction
that
may
be
only
figurative
but
i
m
not
particular
about
the
sea
if
i
can
have
rivers
and
little
brooks
and
fountains
of
just
the
right
sort
the
fountains
of
this
world
don
t
please
me
generally
i
want
a
little
brook
to
sit
and
sing
to
faith
by
o
i
forgot
she
will
be
a
large
girl
probably
won
t
she
never
too
large
to
like
to
hear
your
mother
sing
will
you
faith
o
no
said
faith
who
bobbed
in
and
out
again
like
a
canary
just
then
not
unless
i
m
big
with
long
dresses
and
a
waterfall
you
know
i
s
pose
maybe
i
d
have
to
have
little
girls
myself
to
sing
to
then
i
hope
they
ll
behave
better
n
mary
ann
does
she
s
lost
her
other
arm
and
all
her
sawdust
is
just
running
out
besides
kitty
thought
she
was
a
mouse
and
ran
down
cellar
with
her
and
she
s
all
shooken
up
somehow
she
don
t
look
very
flowers
too
her
mother
went
on
after
the
interruption
all
amaranth
and
asphodel
but
of
variety
and
color
and
beauty
unimagined
glorified
lilies
of
the
valley
heavenly
buds
and
spiritual
harebells
among
them
o
how
your
poor
mother
used
to
say
you
know
flowers
were
her
poetry
coming
in
weak
and
worn
from
her
garden
in
the
early
part
of
her
sickness
hands
and
lap
and
basket
full
winifred
if
i
only
supposed
i
have
some
flowers
in
heaven
i
shouldn
t
be
half
so
afraid
to
go
i
had
not
thought
as
much
about
these
things
then
as
i
have
now
or
i
should
have
known
better
how
to
answer
her
i
should
like
if
i
had
my
choice
to
have
and
carnations
fresh
under
my
windows
all
the
under
your
windows
yes
i
hope
to
have
a
home
of
my
not
a
house
something
not
unlike
it
in
the
father
s
house
are
many
mansions
sometimes
i
fancy
that
those
words
have
a
literal
meaning
which
the
simple
men
who
heard
them
may
have
understood
better
than
we
and
that
christ
is
truly
preparing
my
home
for
me
he
must
be
there
too
you
see
i
mean
i
believe
that
gave
me
some
thoughts
that
i
ought
not
to
have
and
so
i
made
no
reply
if
we
have
trees
and
mountains
and
flowers
and
books
she
went
on
smiling
i
don
t
see
why
not
have
houses
as
well
indeed
they
seem
to
me
as
supposable
as
anything
can
be
which
is
at
the
best
for
what
a
homeless
desolate
sort
of
sensation
it
gives
one
to
think
of
people
wandering
over
the
sweet
fields
beyond
the
flood
without
a
local
habitation
and
a
name
what
could
be
done
with
the
millions
who
from
the
time
of
adam
have
been
gathering
there
unless
they
lived
under
the
conditions
of
organized
society
organized
society
involves
homes
not
unlike
the
homes
of
this
world
what
other
arrangement
could
be
as
pleasant
or
could
be
pleasant
at
all
robertson
s
definition
of
a
church
exactly
fits
more
united
in
each
other
because
more
united
in
a
happy
home
is
the
happiest
thing
in
the
world
i
do
not
see
why
it
should
not
be
in
any
world
i
do
not
believe
that
all
the
little
tendernesses
of
family
ties
are
thrown
by
and
lost
with
this
life
in
fact
mary
i
can
not
think
that
anything
which
has
in
it
the
elements
of
permanency
is
to
be
lost
but
sin
eternity
can
not
be
it
can
not
be
the
great
blank
ocean
which
most
of
us
have
somehow
or
other
been
brought
up
to
feel
that
it
is
which
shall
swallow
up
in
a
pitiless
glorified
way
all
the
little
brooks
of
our
delight
so
i
expect
to
have
my
beautiful
home
and
my
husband
and
faith
as
i
had
them
here
with
many
differences
and
great
ones
but
just
the
same
unless
faith
goes
into
a
home
of
her
own
the
little
creature
i
suppose
she
can
t
always
be
a
baby
do
you
remember
what
a
pretty
little
wistful
way
charles
lamb
has
of
wondering
about
all
this
shall
i
enjoy
friendships
there
wanting
the
smiling
indications
which
point
me
to
them
here
the
sweet
assurance
of
a
look
sun
and
sky
and
breeze
and
solitary
walks
and
summer
holidays
and
the
greenness
of
fields
and
the
delicious
juices
of
meats
and
fish
and
society
and
and
fireside
conversations
and
innocent
vanities
and
jests
and
do
these
things
go
out
with
life
now
aunt
winifred
i
said
sitting
up
straight
what
am
i
to
do
with
these
beautiful
heresies
if
deacon
quirk
hear
i
do
not
see
where
the
heresy
lies
as
i
hold
fast
by
the
bible
i
can
not
be
in
much
but
you
don
t
glean
your
conjectures
from
the
i
conjecture
nothing
that
the
bible
contradicts
i
do
not
believe
as
truth
indisputable
anything
that
the
bible
does
not
give
me
but
i
reason
from
analogy
about
this
as
we
all
do
about
other
matters
why
should
we
not
have
pretty
things
in
heaven
if
this
bright
and
beautiful
economy
of
skies
and
rivers
of
grass
and
sunshine
of
hills
and
valleys
is
not
too
good
for
such
a
place
as
this
world
will
there
be
any
less
variety
of
the
bright
and
beautiful
in
the
next
there
is
no
reason
for
supposing
that
the
voice
of
god
will
speak
to
us
in
or
that
it
will
not
take
to
itself
the
thousand
gentle
suggestive
tongues
of
a
nature
built
on
the
ruins
of
this
an
unmarred
system
of
beneficence
there
is
a
pretty
argument
in
the
fact
that
just
such
sunrises
such
opening
of
buds
such
fragrant
dropping
of
fruit
such
bells
in
the
brooks
such
dreams
at
twilight
and
such
hush
of
stars
were
fit
for
adam
and
eve
made
holy
man
and
woman
how
do
we
know
that
the
abstract
idea
of
a
heaven
needs
imply
anything
very
much
unlike
eden
there
is
some
reason
as
well
as
poetry
in
the
conception
of
a
paradise
a
new
earth
wherein
dwelleth
but
how
far
is
it
safe
to
trust
to
this
kind
of
argument
bishop
butler
will
answer
you
better
than
i
let
me
see
isaac
taylor
says
something
about
she
went
to
the
bookcase
for
his
physical
theory
of
another
life
and
finding
her
place
showed
me
this
passage
if
this
often
repeated
argument
from
analogy
is
to
be
termed
as
to
the
conclusions
it
involves
a
conjecture
merely
we
ought
then
to
abandon
altogether
every
kind
of
abstract
reasoning
nor
will
it
be
easy
afterwards
to
make
good
any
principle
of
natural
theology
in
truth
the
very
basis
of
reasoning
is
shaken
by
a
scepticism
so
sweeping
as
and
in
another
place
none
need
fear
the
consequences
of
such
endeavors
who
have
well
learned
the
prime
principle
of
sound
philosophy
namely
not
to
allow
the
most
plausible
and
pleasing
conjectures
to
unsettle
our
convictions
of
truth
resting
upon
positive
evidence
if
there
be
any
who
frown
upon
all
such
attempts
they
would
do
well
to
consider
that
although
individually
and
from
the
constitution
of
their
minds
they
may
find
it
very
easy
to
abstain
from
every
path
of
excursive
meditation
it
is
not
so
with
others
who
almost
irresistibly
are
borne
forward
to
the
vast
field
of
universal
contemplation
a
field
from
which
the
human
mind
is
not
to
be
barred
and
which
is
better
taken
possession
of
by
those
who
reverently
bow
to
the
authority
of
christianity
than
left
open
to
very
good
i
said
laying
down
the
book
but
about
those
trees
and
houses
and
the
rest
of
your
pretty
things
are
they
to
be
like
these
i
don
t
suppose
that
the
houses
will
be
made
of
oak
and
pine
and
nailed
together
for
instance
but
i
hope
for
heavenly
types
of
nature
and
of
art
that
will
be
to
us
then
what
these
are
that
is
the
amount
of
it
they
may
be
as
spiritual
as
you
please
they
will
answer
all
the
purpose
to
us
as
we
are
not
spiritual
beings
yet
however
i
am
under
the
necessity
of
calling
them
by
their
earthly
names
you
remember
plato
s
old
theory
that
the
ideal
of
everything
exists
eternally
in
the
mind
of
god
if
that
is
so
and
i
do
not
see
how
it
can
be
otherwise
then
whatever
of
god
is
expressed
to
us
in
this
world
by
flower
or
blade
of
grass
or
human
face
why
should
not
that
be
expressed
forever
in
heaven
by
something
corresponding
to
flower
or
grass
or
human
face
i
do
not
mean
that
the
heavenly
creation
will
be
less
real
than
these
but
more
so
their
spirituality
is
of
such
a
sort
that
our
gardens
and
forests
and
homes
are
but
shadows
of
them
you
don
t
know
how
i
amuse
myself
at
night
thinking
this
all
over
before
i
go
to
sleep
wondering
what
one
thing
will
be
like
and
another
thing
planning
what
i
should
like
thinking
that
john
has
seen
it
all
and
wondering
if
he
is
laughing
at
me
because
i
know
so
little
about
it
i
tell
you
mary
there
s
a
deal
o
comfort
in
t
as
phœbe
says
about
her
cup
of
july
aunt
winifred
has
been
hunting
up
a
sunday
school
class
for
herself
and
one
for
me
which
is
a
venture
that
i
never
was
persuaded
into
undertaking
before
she
herself
is
fast
becoming
acquainted
with
the
poorer
people
of
the
town
i
find
that
she
is
a
thoroughly
busy
christian
with
a
certain
holiness
that
is
strong
and
refreshing
like
a
west
wind
and
conversations
on
heaven
by
no
means
exhaust
her
vitality
she
told
me
a
pretty
thing
about
her
class
it
happened
the
first
sabbath
that
she
took
it
her
scholars
are
young
girls
of
from
fourteen
to
eighteen
years
of
age
children
of
most
of
them
she
seemed
to
have
taken
their
hearts
by
storm
says
they
treated
me
very
prettily
and
made
me
love
them
at
clo
bentley
is
in
the
class
clo
is
a
pretty
little
creature
with
a
shrinking
mouth
and
an
absorbing
passion
for
music
which
she
has
always
been
too
poor
to
gratify
i
suspect
that
her
teacher
will
make
a
pet
of
her
she
says
that
in
the
course
of
her
lesson
or
in
her
words
while
we
were
all
talking
together
somebody
pulled
my
sleeve
and
there
was
clo
in
the
corner
with
her
great
brown
eyes
fixed
on
me
see
here
she
said
in
a
whisper
i
can
t
be
good
i
would
be
good
if
i
could
just
have
a
piano
well
clo
i
said
if
you
will
be
a
good
girl
and
go
to
heaven
i
think
you
will
have
a
piano
there
and
play
just
as
much
as
you
care
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
look
the
child
gave
me
delight
and
fear
and
incredulous
bewilderment
tumbled
over
each
other
as
if
i
had
proposed
taking
her
into
a
forbidden
why
forceythe
why
they
won
t
let
anybody
have
a
piano
up
there
not
in
i
laid
down
the
and
asked
what
kind
of
place
she
supposed
that
heaven
was
going
to
be
o
she
said
with
a
dreary
sigh
i
never
think
about
it
when
i
can
help
it
i
suppose
we
all
just
stand
and
you
i
asked
of
the
next
a
bright
girl
with
snapping
eyes
do
you
want
me
to
talk
good
or
tell
the
truth
she
answered
me
having
been
given
to
understand
that
she
was
not
expected
to
talk
good
in
my
class
she
said
with
an
approving
decided
nod
well
then
i
don
t
think
it
s
going
to
be
anyway
no
i
don
t
i
told
my
last
teacher
so
and
she
looked
just
as
shocked
and
said
i
never
should
go
there
as
long
as
i
felt
so
that
made
me
mad
and
i
told
her
i
didn
t
see
but
i
should
be
as
well
off
in
one
place
as
another
except
for
the
a
silent
girl
in
the
corner
began
at
this
point
to
look
interested
i
always
supposed
said
she
that
you
just
floated
round
in
heaven
you
know
all
together
something
like
paste
whereupon
i
shut
the
entirely
and
took
the
talking
to
myself
for
a
while
but
i
thought
it
was
anything
like
that
interrupted
little
clo
presently
her
cheeks
flushed
with
excitement
why
i
should
like
to
go
if
it
is
like
that
i
never
supposed
people
talked
unless
it
was
about
converting
people
and
saying
your
prayers
and
all
now
weren
t
those
ideas
b
alluring
and
comforting
for
young
girls
in
the
blossom
of
warm
human
life
they
were
trying
with
all
their
little
hearts
to
be
good
too
some
of
them
and
had
all
of
them
been
to
church
and
sunday
school
all
their
lives
never
never
if
jesus
christ
had
been
teacher
and
preacher
to
them
would
he
have
pictured
their
blessed
endless
years
with
him
in
such
bleak
colors
they
are
not
the
hues
of
his
b
facts
xi
july
we
took
a
trip
to
east
homer
for
butter
neither
angels
nor
principalities
could
convince
phœbe
that
any
butter
but
stephen
david
s
might
could
would
or
should
be
used
in
this
family
so
to
stephen
david
s
a
journey
of
four
miles
i
meekly
betake
myself
at
stated
periods
in
the
domestic
year
burdened
with
directions
about
firkins
and
pounds
and
salt
and
no
salt
churning
and
some
of
which
i
remember
and
some
of
which
i
forget
and
to
all
of
which
phœbe
considers
me
sublimely
incapable
of
attending
the
afternoon
was
perfect
and
we
took
things
leisurely
letting
the
reins
swing
from
the
hook
an
arrangement
to
which
tripp
s
old
gray
was
entirely
agreeable
and
leaning
back
against
the
wound
along
among
the
strong
sweet
lazily
talking
or
lazily
silent
as
the
spirit
moved
and
as
only
two
people
who
thoroughly
understand
and
like
each
other
can
talk
or
be
silent
we
rode
home
by
deacon
quirk
s
and
as
we
jogged
by
there
broke
upon
our
view
a
blooming
vision
of
the
deacon
himself
at
work
in
his
with
his
son
and
heir
who
by
the
way
has
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
awkward
fellow
in
the
township
the
amiable
having
caught
sight
of
us
left
his
work
and
coming
up
to
the
fence
in
rustic
modesty
unscared
guiltless
of
coat
or
vest
his
calico
rolled
up
to
his
huge
brown
elbows
and
his
dusty
straw
hat
flapping
in
the
wind
rapped
on
the
rails
with
his
as
a
sign
for
us
to
stop
are
we
in
a
hurry
i
asked
under
my
breath
o
no
said
aunt
winifred
he
has
somewhat
to
say
unto
me
i
see
by
his
eyes
i
have
been
expecting
it
let
us
hear
him
out
good
afternoon
deacon
good
afternoon
ma
am
pleasant
day
she
assented
to
the
statement
novel
as
it
was
a
very
pleasant
day
repeated
the
deacon
looking
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
to
my
knowledge
a
little
undecided
as
to
what
he
should
say
next
remarkable
fine
day
for
riding
in
a
hurry
well
not
especially
did
you
want
anything
of
me
you
re
a
aren
t
you
ma
am
asked
the
deacon
abruptly
i
orthodox
o
yes
with
a
smile
you
had
a
reason
for
asking
yes
ma
am
i
had
as
you
might
say
a
reason
for
the
deacon
laid
his
hoe
on
the
top
of
the
fence
and
his
arms
across
it
and
pushed
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
in
a
becoming
and
argumentative
manner
i
hope
you
don
t
consider
that
i
m
taking
liberties
if
i
have
a
little
religious
conversation
with
you
it
is
no
offence
to
me
if
you
are
replied
forceythe
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
but
both
twinkle
and
words
glanced
off
from
the
deacon
my
wife
was
telling
me
last
night
he
began
with
an
ominous
cough
that
her
niece
clotildy
bentley
moses
bentley
s
daughter
you
know
and
one
of
your
sentimental
girls
that
reads
poetry
and
is
easy
enough
led
away
by
vain
delusions
and
false
doctrine
was
under
your
charge
at
now
clotildy
is
intimate
with
my
wife
who
is
her
aunt
on
her
mother
s
side
and
always
tries
to
do
her
duty
by
her
and
she
told
quirk
what
you
d
been
a
saying
to
those
young
minds
on
the
he
stopped
and
observed
her
impressively
as
if
he
expected
to
see
the
guilty
blushes
of
arraigned
heresy
covering
her
amused
attentive
face
i
hope
you
will
pardon
me
ma
am
for
repeating
it
but
clotildy
said
that
you
told
her
she
should
have
a
pianna
in
heaven
a
ma
am
i
certainly
did
she
said
quietly
you
did
well
now
i
didn
t
believe
it
nor
i
wouldn
t
believe
it
till
i
d
asked
you
i
thought
it
warn
t
more
than
fair
that
i
should
ask
you
before
repeating
it
you
know
it
s
none
of
my
business
forceythe
any
more
than
that
i
take
a
general
interest
in
the
spiritooal
welfare
of
the
youth
of
our
sabbath
school
but
i
am
very
much
surprised
i
am
much
surprised
i
am
surprised
that
you
should
be
deacon
quirk
do
you
believe
that
god
would
take
a
poor
little
disappointed
girl
like
clo
who
has
been
all
her
life
here
forbidden
the
enjoyment
of
a
perfectly
innocent
taste
and
keep
her
in
his
happy
heaven
eternal
years
without
finding
means
to
gratify
it
i
don
i
tell
clotildy
i
don
t
see
what
she
wants
of
a
observed
clotildy
s
uncle
sententiously
she
can
go
to
singin
school
and
she
s
been
in
the
choir
ever
since
i
have
which
is
six
years
come
christmas
besides
i
don
t
think
it
s
our
place
to
speckylate
on
the
mysteries
of
the
heavenly
spere
my
wife
told
her
that
she
mustn
t
believe
any
such
things
as
that
which
were
very
irreverent
and
contrary
to
the
scriptures
and
clo
went
home
crying
she
said
it
was
so
pretty
to
think
it
is
very
easy
to
impress
these
delusions
of
fancy
on
the
pray
deacon
quirk
said
aunt
winifred
leaning
earnestly
forward
in
the
carriage
will
you
tell
me
what
there
is
irreverent
or
unscriptural
in
the
idea
that
there
will
be
instrumental
music
in
heaven
well
replied
the
deacon
after
some
consideration
come
to
think
of
it
there
will
be
harps
i
suppose
harpers
harping
with
their
harps
on
the
sea
of
glass
but
i
don
t
believe
there
will
be
any
piannas
it
s
a
dreadfully
material
way
to
talk
about
that
glorious
world
to
my
if
you
could
show
me
wherein
a
harp
is
less
material
than
a
piano
perhaps
i
should
agree
with
deacon
quirk
looked
rather
nonplussed
for
a
minute
what
you
suppose
people
will
do
in
heaven
she
asked
again
glorify
god
said
the
deacon
promptly
recovering
himself
glorify
god
and
sing
worthy
the
lamb
we
shall
be
clothed
in
white
robes
with
palms
in
our
hands
and
bow
before
the
great
white
throne
we
shall
be
engaged
in
such
employments
as
befit
sinless
creatures
in
a
spiritooal
state
of
now
deacon
quirk
replied
aunt
winifred
looking
him
over
from
head
to
foot
old
straw
hat
calico
shirt
blue
overalls
and
boots
coarse
hands
and
narrow
forehead
braided
tight
just
imagine
yourself
will
you
taken
out
of
this
life
this
minute
as
you
stand
here
in
your
the
deacon
changed
his
position
with
evident
uneasiness
and
put
into
another
life
not
anybody
else
but
yourself
just
as
you
left
this
spot
and
do
you
honestly
think
that
you
should
be
happy
to
go
and
put
on
a
white
dress
and
stand
still
in
a
choir
with
a
green
branch
in
one
hand
and
a
in
the
other
and
sing
and
pray
and
never
do
anything
but
sing
and
pray
this
year
next
year
and
every
year
forever
he
replied
surprised
into
a
momentary
flash
of
carnal
candor
i
can
t
say
that
i
shouldn
t
wonder
for
a
minute
maybe
abinadab
would
ever
get
those
potatoes
hoed
without
abinadab
go
back
to
your
work
the
graceful
abinadab
had
sauntered
up
during
the
conversation
and
was
listening
hoe
in
hand
and
mouth
open
he
slunk
away
when
his
father
spoke
but
came
up
again
presently
on
tiptoe
when
aunt
winifred
was
talking
there
was
an
interested
intelligent
look
about
his
square
and
pitifully
embarrassed
face
which
attracted
my
notice
but
then
proceeded
the
deacon
by
the
sudden
recollection
of
his
duties
as
a
father
and
a
that
couldn
t
be
a
permanent
state
of
feeling
you
know
i
expect
to
be
transformed
by
the
renewing
of
my
mind
to
appreciate
the
glories
of
the
new
jerusalem
descending
out
of
heaven
from
god
that
s
what
i
expect
marm
now
i
heerd
that
you
told
mrs
bland
or
that
mary
told
her
or
that
she
heerd
it
someway
that
you
said
you
supposed
there
were
trees
and
flowers
and
houses
and
such
in
heaven
i
told
my
wife
i
thought
your
deceased
husband
was
a
congregational
minister
and
i
didn
t
believe
you
ever
said
it
but
that
s
the
without
deeming
it
necessary
to
refer
to
her
deceased
husband
aunt
winifred
replied
that
rumor
was
quite
right
well
said
the
deacon
with
severe
significance
believe
in
a
spiritooal
i
looked
him
over
again
hat
hoe
shirt
and
all
scanned
his
obstinate
old
face
with
its
stupid
good
eyes
and
animal
mouth
then
i
glanced
at
aunt
winifred
as
she
leaned
forward
in
the
afternoon
light
the
white
finely
cut
woman
with
her
serene
smile
and
rapt
saintly
eyes
every
inch
of
her
body
and
soul
refined
not
only
by
birth
and
training
but
by
the
long
nearness
of
her
heart
to
christ
of
the
earth
earthy
of
the
heavens
the
two
faces
sharpened
themselves
into
two
types
which
indeed
was
the
better
able
to
comprehend
a
spiritooal
heaven
it
is
distinctly
stated
in
the
bible
by
which
i
suppose
we
shall
both
agree
said
aunt
winifred
gently
that
there
shall
be
a
as
well
as
new
heavens
it
is
noticeable
also
that
the
descriptions
of
heaven
although
a
series
of
metaphors
are
yet
singularly
earthlike
and
tangible
ones
are
flowers
and
skies
and
trees
less
spiritual
than
white
dresses
and
little
in
fact
where
are
you
going
to
get
your
little
branches
without
trees
what
could
well
be
more
suggestive
of
material
modes
of
living
and
material
industry
than
a
city
marked
into
streets
and
alleys
paved
solidly
with
gold
walled
in
and
barred
with
gates
whose
jewels
are
named
and
counted
and
whose
very
length
and
breadth
are
measured
with
a
celestial
surveyor
s
chain
but
i
think
we
d
ought
to
stick
to
what
the
bible
says
answered
the
deacon
stolidly
if
it
says
golden
cities
and
doesn
t
say
flowers
it
means
cities
and
doesn
t
mean
flowers
i
dare
say
you
re
a
good
woman
forceythe
if
you
do
hold
such
oncommon
doctrine
and
i
don
t
doubt
you
mean
well
enough
but
i
don
t
think
that
we
ought
to
trouble
ourselves
about
these
mysteries
of
a
future
state
m
willing
to
trust
them
to
god
the
evasion
of
a
fair
argument
by
this
spasm
of
piety
was
more
than
i
could
calmly
stand
and
i
indulged
in
a
subdued
auntie
says
it
sounded
like
fourth
of
july
crackers
touched
off
under
a
wet
barrel
deacon
quirk
do
you
mean
to
imply
that
forceythe
does
not
trust
it
to
god
the
truth
is
that
the
existence
of
such
a
world
as
heaven
is
a
fact
from
which
you
shrink
you
know
you
do
she
has
twenty
thoughts
about
it
where
you
have
one
yet
you
set
up
a
claim
to
superior
spirituality
mary
mary
you
are
a
little
excited
i
fear
god
is
a
spirit
and
they
that
worship
him
must
worship
him
in
spirit
and
in
truth
the
relevancy
of
this
last
i
confess
myself
incapable
of
perceiving
but
the
good
man
seemed
to
be
convinced
that
he
had
made
a
point
and
we
rode
off
leaving
him
under
that
blissful
delusion
if
he
a
good
man
i
sighed
but
he
is
and
i
must
respect
him
for
of
course
you
must
nor
is
he
to
blame
that
he
is
narrow
and
rough
i
should
scarcely
have
argued
as
seriously
as
i
did
with
him
but
that
as
i
fancy
him
to
be
a
representative
of
a
class
i
wanted
to
try
an
experiment
isn
t
he
amusing
though
he
is
precisely
one
of
stopford
brooke
s
men
who
can
understand
nothing
which
is
are
there
or
are
there
not
more
of
such
men
in
our
church
than
in
others
not
more
proportionately
to
numbers
but
i
would
not
have
them
thinned
out
the
better
we
do
christ
s
work
the
more
of
uneducated
neglected
or
debased
mind
will
be
drawn
to
try
and
serve
him
with
us
he
sought
out
the
lame
the
halt
the
blind
the
stupid
the
crotchety
the
rough
as
well
as
the
equable
the
intelligent
the
refined
untrained
christians
in
any
sect
will
always
have
their
eccentricities
and
their
littlenesses
at
which
the
silken
judgment
of
high
places
where
the
carpenter
s
son
would
be
a
strange
guest
will
sneer
that
never
troubles
me
it
only
raises
the
question
in
my
mind
whether
cultivated
christians
generally
are
sufficiently
scattering
their
golden
gifts
on
wayside
now
take
deacon
quirk
i
suggested
when
we
had
ridden
along
a
little
way
under
the
low
green
arches
of
the
elms
and
put
him
into
heaven
as
you
proposed
just
as
he
is
and
what
he
going
to
do
with
himself
he
can
dig
potatoes
and
sell
them
without
cheating
and
give
generously
of
their
proceeds
to
foreign
missions
but
take
away
his
potatoes
and
what
would
become
of
him
i
don
t
know
a
human
being
more
incapacitated
to
live
in
such
a
heaven
as
he
believes
very
true
and
a
good
argument
against
such
a
heaven
i
don
t
profess
to
surmise
what
will
be
found
for
him
to
do
beyond
this
that
it
will
be
some
very
palpable
work
that
he
can
understand
how
do
we
know
that
he
would
not
be
appointed
guardian
of
his
poor
son
here
to
whom
i
suspect
he
has
not
been
all
that
father
might
be
in
this
life
and
that
he
would
not
have
his
body
as
well
as
his
soul
to
look
after
his
farm
as
well
as
his
prayers
to
him
might
be
committed
the
charge
of
the
dews
and
the
rains
and
the
hundred
unseen
influences
that
are
at
work
on
this
very
but
when
his
son
has
gone
in
his
turn
and
we
have
all
gone
and
there
are
no
more
an
eternity
you
don
t
know
that
there
wouldn
t
be
any
there
may
be
some
kind
of
agricultural
employments
even
then
to
whomsoever
a
talent
is
given
it
will
be
given
him
wherewith
to
use
it
besides
by
that
time
the
good
deacon
will
be
immensely
changed
i
suppose
that
the
simple
transition
of
death
which
rids
him
of
sin
and
of
grossness
will
not
only
wonderfully
refine
him
but
will
have
its
effect
upon
his
if
a
talent
is
given
use
will
be
found
for
it
tell
me
some
more
about
i
fancy
many
things
about
it
but
of
course
can
feel
sure
of
only
the
foundation
principle
this
life
is
a
great
the
wise
teacher
trains
in
us
such
gifts
as
if
we
graduate
honorably
will
be
of
most
service
in
the
perfect
manhood
and
womanhood
that
come
after
he
sees
as
we
do
not
that
a
power
is
sometimes
best
trained
by
repression
we
do
not
always
lose
an
advantage
when
we
dispense
with
it
goethe
says
but
the
suffocated
lives
like
little
clo
s
there
make
my
heart
ache
sometimes
i
take
comfort
in
thinking
how
they
will
bud
and
blossom
up
in
the
air
by
and
by
there
are
a
great
many
of
them
we
tread
them
underfoot
in
our
careless
stepping
now
and
then
and
do
not
see
that
they
have
not
the
elasticity
to
rise
from
our
touch
heaven
may
be
a
place
for
those
who
failed
on
earth
the
country
parson
then
there
will
be
air
enough
for
all
for
all
for
those
who
have
had
a
little
bloom
in
this
world
as
well
i
suppose
the
artist
will
paint
his
pictures
the
poet
sing
his
happy
songs
the
orator
and
author
will
not
find
their
talents
hidden
in
the
eternal
darkness
of
a
grave
the
sculptor
will
use
his
beautiful
gift
in
the
moulding
of
some
heavenly
carrara
as
well
the
singer
as
the
player
on
instruments
shall
be
christ
said
a
thing
that
has
grown
on
me
with
new
meanings
lately
he
that
his
life
for
my
sake
shall
find
you
see
not
another
man
s
life
not
a
strange
compound
of
powers
and
pleasures
but
his
own
familiar
aspirations
so
we
shall
best
glorify
god
not
less
there
than
here
by
doing
it
in
the
peculiar
way
that
he
himself
marked
out
for
us
but
ah
mary
you
see
it
is
only
the
life
lost
for
his
sake
that
shall
be
so
beautifully
found
a
great
man
never
goes
to
heaven
because
he
is
great
he
must
go
as
the
meanest
of
his
go
with
face
towards
calvary
and
every
golden
treasure
used
for
love
of
him
who
showed
him
what
would
the
old
pagans
and
modern
ones
too
for
that
matter
say
to
that
wasn
t
it
tacitus
who
announced
it
as
his
belief
that
immortality
was
granted
as
a
special
gift
to
a
few
superior
minds
for
the
people
who
persisted
in
making
up
the
rest
of
the
world
poor
things
as
it
could
be
of
little
consequence
what
became
of
them
they
might
die
as
the
brute
it
seems
an
unbearable
thing
to
me
sometimes
she
went
on
the
wreck
of
a
gifted
soul
a
man
who
can
be
if
he
chooses
as
much
better
and
happier
than
the
rest
of
us
as
the
ocean
reflects
more
sky
than
a
must
also
be
if
he
chooses
more
wicked
and
more
miserable
it
takes
longer
to
reach
than
i
am
compelled
to
think
also
that
intellectual
rank
must
in
heaven
bear
some
proportion
to
goodness
there
are
last
and
there
are
first
that
shall
have
changed
places
as
the
tree
falleth
there
shall
it
lie
and
with
that
amount
of
holiness
of
which
a
man
leaves
this
life
the
possessor
he
must
start
in
another
i
have
seen
great
thinkers
foremost
men
in
science
in
theology
in
the
arts
who
i
solemnly
believe
will
turn
aside
in
heaven
and
will
turn
humbly
and
heartily
to
let
certain
and
paupers
whom
i
have
known
go
up
before
them
as
kings
and
priests
unto
i
believe
that
but
i
was
going
to
ask
for
poor
creatures
like
your
respected
niece
who
hasn
t
a
talent
nor
even
a
single
absorbing
taste
for
one
thing
above
another
thing
what
shall
she
do
whatever
she
liketh
best
something
very
useful
my
dear
don
t
be
afraid
and
very
pleasant
something
too
for
which
this
life
has
fitted
you
though
you
may
not
understand
how
that
can
be
better
than
did
poor
heine
on
his
reading
all
the
books
that
treated
of
his
disease
but
what
good
this
reading
is
to
do
me
i
don
t
know
he
said
except
that
it
will
qualify
me
to
give
lectures
in
heaven
on
the
ignorance
of
doctors
on
earth
about
diseases
of
the
spinal
i
don
t
know
how
many
times
i
have
thought
of
i
believe
it
was
the
poet
gray
who
said
that
his
idea
of
heaven
was
to
lie
on
the
sofa
and
read
novels
that
touches
the
lazy
part
of
us
yes
they
will
be
the
active
outgoing
generous
elements
of
our
nature
that
will
be
brought
into
use
then
rather
than
the
and
dreamy
ones
though
i
suppose
that
we
shall
read
in
heaven
being
influenced
to
be
better
and
nobler
by
good
and
noble
teachers
of
the
pen
not
less
there
than
o
think
of
it
to
have
books
and
music
and
pictures
all
that
art
the
handmaid
of
the
lord
can
do
for
us
i
have
no
doubt
will
be
done
eternity
will
never
become
monotonous
variety
without
end
charms
unnumbered
within
charms
will
be
devised
by
infinite
ingenuity
to
minister
to
our
delight
perhaps
this
is
just
my
fancying
perhaps
there
will
be
whole
planets
turned
into
galleries
of
art
over
which
we
may
wander
at
will
or
into
orchestral
halls
where
the
highest
possibilities
of
music
will
be
realized
to
singer
and
to
hearer
do
you
know
i
have
sometimes
had
a
flitting
notion
that
music
would
be
the
language
of
heaven
it
certainly
differs
in
some
indescribable
manner
from
the
other
arts
we
have
most
of
us
felt
it
in
our
different
ways
it
always
seems
to
me
like
the
cry
of
a
great
sad
life
dragged
to
use
in
this
world
against
its
will
pictures
and
statues
and
poems
fit
themselves
to
their
work
more
contentedly
symphony
and
song
struggle
in
fetters
that
sense
of
conflict
is
not
good
for
me
it
is
quite
as
likely
to
harm
as
to
help
then
perhaps
the
mysteries
of
sidereal
systems
will
be
spread
out
like
a
child
s
map
before
us
perhaps
we
shall
take
journeys
to
jupiter
and
to
saturn
and
to
the
glittering
haze
of
nebulæ
and
to
the
site
of
ruined
worlds
whose
extinct
light
is
yet
travelling
through
occupation
for
explorers
there
you
see
you
make
me
say
with
little
clo
o
why
i
want
to
go
every
time
i
hear
you
talk
but
there
is
one
thing
you
spoke
of
families
living
and
you
spoke
of
your
husband
but
the
bible
says
there
shall
be
no
marrying
nor
giving
in
marriage
i
know
that
nor
will
there
be
such
marrying
or
giving
in
marriage
as
there
is
in
a
world
like
this
christ
expressly
goes
on
to
state
that
we
shall
be
the
angels
in
heaven
how
do
we
know
what
heavenly
unions
of
heart
with
heart
exist
among
the
angels
it
leaves
me
margin
enough
to
live
and
be
happy
with
john
forever
and
it
holds
many
possibilities
for
the
settlement
of
all
perplexing
questions
brought
about
by
the
relations
of
this
world
it
is
of
no
use
to
talk
much
about
them
but
it
is
on
that
very
verse
that
i
found
my
unshaken
belief
that
they
will
be
smoothed
out
in
some
natural
and
happy
way
with
which
each
one
shall
be
but
o
there
is
a
great
gulf
fixed
and
on
one
side
one
and
on
the
other
another
and
they
loved
each
her
face
paled
it
always
pales
i
notice
at
the
mention
of
this
mystery
but
her
eyes
never
lost
by
a
shade
their
steadfast
trust
mary
don
t
question
me
about
that
belongs
to
the
unutterable
things
god
will
take
care
of
it
i
i
could
leave
it
to
him
even
if
he
brought
it
for
me
myself
to
face
i
feel
sure
that
he
will
make
it
all
come
out
right
perhaps
he
will
be
so
dear
to
us
that
we
could
not
love
any
one
who
hated
him
in
some
way
the
void
be
filled
for
he
shall
wipe
away
tears
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
thought
in
which
there
can
be
any
and
in
that
there
is
this
that
christ
who
loves
us
even
as
his
father
loves
him
can
be
happy
in
spite
of
the
existence
of
a
hell
if
it
is
possible
to
him
surely
he
can
make
it
possible
to
two
things
that
he
has
taught
us
she
said
after
a
silence
give
me
beautiful
assurance
that
none
of
these
dreams
with
which
i
help
myself
can
be
beyond
his
intention
to
fulfil
one
is
that
eye
hath
not
seen
it
nor
ear
heard
it
nor
the
heart
conceived
it
this
lavishness
of
reward
which
he
is
keeping
for
us
another
is
that
i
shall
be
when
i
with
his
with
his
likeness
and
about
that
i
have
other
things
to
but
old
gray
stopped
at
the
gate
and
phœbe
was
watching
for
her
butter
and
it
was
no
time
to
say
them
then
xii
july
aunt
winifred
has
connected
herself
with
our
church
i
think
it
was
rather
hard
for
her
breaking
the
last
tie
that
bound
her
to
her
husband
s
people
but
she
had
a
feeling
that
if
her
work
is
to
be
done
and
her
days
ended
here
she
had
better
take
up
all
such
little
threads
of
influence
to
make
herself
one
with
us
what
should
deacon
quirk
do
but
make
a
solemn
call
on
forceythe
for
the
purpose
of
asking
and
this
with
a
hint
that
he
wished
he
had
asked
before
she
became
a
member
of
the
homer
first
congregational
church
whether
there
were
truth
in
the
rumors
now
rife
about
town
that
she
was
a
swedenborgian
aunt
winifred
broke
out
laughing
and
laughed
merrily
the
deacon
frowned
i
used
to
fancy
that
i
believed
in
swedenborg
she
said
as
soon
as
she
could
sober
down
a
little
the
deacon
pricked
up
his
ears
with
visions
of
excommunications
and
councils
reflected
on
every
feature
until
i
read
his
books
she
finished
oh
said
the
deacon
he
waited
for
more
but
she
seemed
to
consider
the
conversation
at
an
end
so
then
you
if
i
understand
are
a
swedenborgian
ma
am
if
i
were
i
certainly
should
have
had
no
inducement
to
join
myself
to
your
church
she
replied
with
gentle
dignity
i
believe
with
all
my
heart
in
the
same
bible
and
the
same
creed
that
you
believe
in
deacon
and
you
your
creed
which
all
such
genial
christians
do
not
find
it
necessary
to
do
i
thought
as
the
deacon
in
some
perplexity
took
his
departure
and
she
returned
with
a
smile
to
her
sewing
i
suppose
the
call
came
about
in
this
way
we
had
the
here
last
week
and
just
before
the
lamps
were
lighted
and
when
people
had
dropped
their
work
to
group
and
talk
in
the
corners
meta
tripp
came
up
with
one
or
two
other
girls
to
aunt
winifred
and
begged
to
hear
some
of
those
queer
things
people
said
she
believed
about
auntie
is
never
obtrusive
with
her
views
on
this
or
any
other
matter
but
being
thus
urged
she
answered
a
few
questions
that
they
put
to
her
to
the
extreme
scandal
of
one
or
two
old
ladies
and
the
secret
delight
of
the
rest
well
said
little
mrs
bland
squeezing
and
kissing
her
youngest
who
was
at
that
moment
vigorously
employed
in
sticking
very
long
into
his
mother
s
waterfall
i
hope
there
ll
be
a
great
many
babies
there
i
should
be
perfectly
happy
if
i
always
could
have
babies
to
play
with
the
look
that
aunt
winifred
shot
over
at
me
was
worth
seeing
she
merely
replied
however
that
she
supposed
all
our
highest
aspirations
with
an
indescribable
accent
to
which
mrs
bland
was
safely
deaf
if
good
ones
would
be
realized
and
added
laughing
that
swedenborg
said
that
the
babies
in
heaven
who
outnumber
the
grown
people
will
be
given
into
the
charge
of
those
women
especially
fond
of
them
swedenborg
is
suggestive
even
if
you
can
t
accept
what
seem
to
the
uninitiated
to
be
his
natural
impossibilities
she
said
after
we
had
discussed
deacon
quirk
awhile
he
says
a
pretty
thing
too
occasionally
did
i
ever
read
you
about
the
houses
she
had
not
and
i
wished
to
hear
so
she
found
the
book
on
heaven
and
hell
and
read
as
often
as
i
have
spoken
with
the
angels
mouth
to
mouth
so
often
i
have
been
with
them
in
their
habitations
their
habitations
are
altogether
like
the
habitations
on
earth
which
are
called
houses
but
more
beautiful
in
them
are
parlors
rooms
and
chambers
in
great
numbers
there
are
also
courts
and
round
about
are
gardens
shrubberies
and
fields
palaces
of
heaven
have
been
seen
which
were
so
magnificent
that
they
could
not
be
described
above
they
glittered
as
if
they
were
of
pure
gold
and
below
as
if
they
were
of
precious
stones
one
palace
was
more
splendid
than
another
within
it
was
the
same
the
rooms
were
ornamented
with
such
decorations
as
neither
words
nor
sciences
are
sufficient
to
describe
on
the
side
which
looked
to
the
south
there
were
paradises
where
all
things
in
like
manner
glittered
and
in
some
places
the
leaves
were
as
of
silver
and
the
fruits
as
of
gold
and
the
flowers
on
their
beds
presented
by
colors
as
it
were
rainbows
at
the
boundaries
again
were
palaces
in
which
the
view
aunt
winifred
says
that
our
hymns
taken
all
together
contain
the
worst
and
the
best
pictures
of
heaven
that
we
have
in
any
branch
of
literature
it
seems
to
me
incredible
she
says
that
the
christian
church
should
have
allowed
that
beautiful
jerusalem
in
its
hymnology
so
long
with
the
ghastly
couplet
where
congregations
ne
er
break
up
and
sabbaths
have
no
the
dullest
preachers
are
sure
to
give
it
out
and
that
when
there
are
the
greatest
number
of
restless
children
wondering
when
it
will
be
time
to
go
home
it
is
only
within
ten
years
that
modern
hymn
books
have
altered
it
returning
in
part
to
the
original
i
do
not
think
we
have
chosen
the
best
parts
of
that
hymn
for
our
service
of
you
never
read
the
whole
of
it
you
don
t
know
how
pretty
it
is
it
is
a
relief
from
the
customary
palms
and
choirs
one
s
whole
heart
is
glad
of
the
outlet
of
its
sweet
refrain
would
god
that
i
were
there
before
one
has
half
read
it
you
are
quite
ready
to
believe
that
there
is
no
hunger
heat
nor
cold
but
every
listen
to
this
thy
houses
are
of
ivory
thy
windows
crystal
clear
thy
tiles
are
made
of
beaten
gold
o
god
that
i
were
there
we
that
are
here
in
banishment
continually
do
moan
our
sweet
is
mixed
with
bitter
gall
our
pleasure
is
but
pain
our
joys
scarce
last
the
looking
on
our
sorrows
still
remain
but
there
they
live
in
such
delight
pleasure
and
such
as
that
to
them
a
thousand
years
doth
seem
as
and
this
thy
gardens
and
thy
gallant
walks
continually
are
green
there
grow
such
sweet
and
pleasant
flowers
as
nowhere
else
are
seen
there
cinnamon
there
sugar
grows
there
nard
and
balm
abound
what
tongue
can
tell
or
heart
conceive
the
joys
that
there
are
found
quite
through
the
streets
with
silver
sound
the
flood
of
life
doth
flow
upon
whose
banks
on
every
side
the
wood
of
life
doth
i
tell
you
we
may
learn
something
from
that
grand
old
catholic
singer
he
is
far
nearer
to
the
bible
than
the
innovators
on
his
mss
do
you
not
notice
how
like
his
images
are
to
the
inspired
ones
and
yet
how
pleasant
and
natural
is
the
effect
of
the
entire
poem
there
is
nobody
like
bonar
though
to
sing
about
heaven
there
is
one
of
his
we
shall
meet
and
rest
do
you
know
it
i
shook
my
head
and
knelt
down
beside
her
and
watched
her
face
it
was
quite
unconscious
of
me
the
musing
face
while
she
repeated
dreamily
where
the
faded
flower
shall
freshen
freshen
nevermore
to
fade
where
the
shaded
sky
shall
brighten
brighten
nevermore
to
shade
where
the
never
scorches
where
the
cease
to
chill
where
no
tempest
stirs
the
echoes
of
the
wood
or
wave
or
hill
where
no
shadow
shall
bewilder
where
life
s
vain
parade
is
o
er
where
the
sleep
of
sin
is
broken
and
the
dreamer
dreams
no
more
where
the
bond
is
never
severed
partings
claspings
sob
and
moan
midnight
waking
twilight
weeping
heavy
noontide
all
are
done
where
the
child
has
found
its
mother
where
the
mother
finds
the
child
where
dear
families
are
gathered
that
were
scattered
on
the
wild
where
the
hidden
wound
is
healed
where
the
blighted
life
reblooms
where
the
smitten
heart
the
freshness
of
its
buoyant
youth
resumes
where
we
find
the
joy
of
loving
as
we
never
loved
before
loving
on
unchilled
unhindered
loving
once
aunt
winifred
was
weeding
her
this
morning
when
the
gate
creaked
timidly
and
then
swung
noisily
and
in
walked
abinadab
quirk
with
a
bouquet
of
china
pinks
in
the
of
his
linen
coat
he
had
taken
evident
pains
to
smarten
himself
up
a
little
for
his
hair
was
combed
into
two
horizontal
over
his
ears
and
the
coat
and
were
quite
clean
but
he
certainly
is
the
most
uncouth
specimen
of
six
feet
five
that
it
has
ever
been
my
privilege
to
behold
i
feel
sorry
for
him
though
i
heard
meta
tripp
laughing
at
him
in
sunday
school
the
other
day
quadrangular
quirk
she
called
him
a
little
too
loud
and
the
poor
fellow
heard
her
he
half
turned
blushing
fiercely
then
slunk
down
in
his
corner
with
as
pitiable
a
look
as
is
often
seen
upon
a
man
s
face
he
came
up
to
auntie
awkwardly
a
part
of
the
scene
i
saw
from
the
window
and
the
rest
she
told
me
head
hanging
and
the
tiny
bouquet
held
out
clo
sent
these
to
you
he
stammered
out
my
cousin
clo
i
was
coming
long
and
she
thought
you
know
she
d
get
me
you
see
to
to
that
is
to
bring
them
she
sent
her
that
is
let
me
see
she
sent
her
respect
ful
respectful
no
her
love
that
was
it
she
sent
her
love
long
with
forceythe
dropped
her
weeds
and
held
out
her
white
shapely
hands
wet
with
the
heavy
dew
to
take
the
flowers
o
thank
you
clo
knows
my
fancy
for
pinks
how
kind
in
you
to
bring
them
won
t
you
sit
down
a
few
moments
i
was
just
going
to
rest
a
little
do
you
like
flowers
abinadab
eyed
the
white
hands
as
his
huge
fingers
just
touched
them
with
a
sort
of
awe
and
sighing
sat
down
on
the
very
edge
of
the
garden
bench
beside
her
after
a
singular
variety
of
efforts
to
take
the
most
uncomfortable
position
of
which
he
was
capable
he
succeeded
to
his
satisfaction
and
growing
then
somewhat
more
at
his
ease
answered
her
question
flowers
are
sech
things
they
just
blow
out
and
that
s
the
end
of
em
like
ah
well
that
is
a
very
useful
liking
do
you
ever
invent
machinery
yourself
sometimes
said
abinadab
with
a
bashful
smile
there
s
a
little
improvement
of
mine
for
up
before
the
now
don
t
know
whether
they
ll
run
it
through
some
of
the
chaps
i
saw
in
boston
told
me
they
thought
they
would
do
t
in
time
it
takes
an
awful
sight
of
time
i
m
alwers
fussing
over
something
of
the
kind
alwers
did
sence
i
was
a
baby
had
my
little
windmills
and
carts
and
things
used
to
sell
em
to
the
other
young
uns
father
don
t
like
it
he
wants
me
to
stick
to
the
farm
i
don
t
like
farming
i
feel
like
a
fish
out
of
mrs
forceythe
marm
he
turned
on
her
with
an
abrupt
change
of
tone
so
funny
that
she
could
with
difficulty
retain
her
gravity
i
heard
you
saying
a
sight
of
queer
things
the
other
day
about
heaven
clo
she
s
been
telling
me
a
sight
more
now
never
believed
in
heaven
why
because
i
don
t
believe
said
the
poor
fellow
with
sullen
decision
that
a
benevolent
god
ever
would
ha
made
sech
a
derned
awkward
chap
as
i
am
aunt
winifred
replied
by
stepping
into
the
house
and
bringing
out
a
fine
photograph
of
one
of
the
best
of
the
georges
a
rapt
yet
very
manly
face
in
which
the
saint
and
the
hero
are
wonderfully
blended
i
suppose
she
said
putting
it
into
his
hands
that
if
you
should
go
to
heaven
you
would
be
as
much
fairer
than
that
picture
as
that
picture
is
fairer
than
you
are
no
why
would
i
though
why
it
would
be
worth
going
for
wouldn
t
it
the
words
were
no
less
reverently
spoken
than
the
vague
rhapsodies
of
his
father
for
the
sullenness
left
his
face
and
his
eyes
which
are
pleasant
and
not
unmanly
when
one
fairly
sees
them
sparkled
softly
like
a
child
s
make
it
all
up
there
maybe
musing
the
girls
laughing
at
you
all
your
life
and
all
that
would
be
the
bigger
heft
of
the
two
then
wouldn
t
it
for
they
say
there
ain
t
any
end
to
things
up
there
why
so
it
might
be
fair
in
him
after
all
more
n
fair
perhaps
see
here
forceythe
i
m
not
a
you
know
and
father
he
s
dreadful
troubled
about
me
prays
over
me
like
a
span
of
ministers
the
old
gentleman
does
every
sunday
night
now
i
don
t
want
to
go
to
the
other
place
any
more
than
the
next
man
and
i
ve
had
my
times
too
of
thinking
i
d
keep
steady
and
say
my
prayers
reg
lar
it
makes
a
chap
feel
on
a
sight
better
terms
with
himself
but
i
don
t
see
how
m
going
to
wear
white
frocks
and
stand
up
in
a
choir
never
could
sing
no
more
n
a
frog
with
a
cold
in
his
head
it
tires
me
more
now
honest
to
think
of
it
than
it
does
to
do
a
week
s
mowing
look
at
me
do
you
s
pose
i
m
fit
for
it
father
he
s
always
talking
about
the
thrones
and
the
wings
and
the
praises
and
the
palms
and
having
new
names
in
your
foreheads
shouldn
t
object
to
that
though
by
any
means
till
he
drives
me
into
the
or
off
on
a
spree
i
tell
him
if
god
hain
t
got
a
place
where
chaps
like
me
can
do
something
he
s
fitted
em
to
do
in
this
world
there
s
no
use
thinking
about
it
so
auntie
took
the
honest
fellow
into
her
most
earnest
thought
for
half
an
hour
and
argued
and
suggested
and
reproved
and
helped
him
as
only
she
could
do
and
at
the
end
of
it
seemed
to
have
worked
into
his
mind
some
distinct
and
not
unwelcome
ideas
of
what
a
life
must
mean
to
him
and
of
the
coming
heaven
which
is
so
much
more
real
to
her
than
any
life
outside
of
it
and
then
she
told
him
i
imagine
that
your
fancy
for
machinery
will
be
employed
in
some
way
perhaps
you
will
do
a
great
deal
more
successful
inventing
there
than
you
ever
will
you
don
t
say
so
said
radiant
abinadab
god
will
give
you
something
to
do
certainly
and
something
that
you
will
i
might
turn
it
to
some
religious
purpose
you
know
said
abinadab
looking
bright
perhaps
i
could
help
em
build
a
church
or
hist
some
of
their
pearl
gates
or
something
like
upon
that
he
said
that
it
was
time
to
be
at
home
and
see
to
the
oxen
and
shambled
awkwardly
away
clo
told
us
this
afternoon
that
he
begged
the
errand
and
the
flowers
from
her
she
says
bin
thinks
there
never
was
anybody
like
you
forceythe
and
bin
isn
t
the
only
one
at
which
forceythe
smiles
absently
thinking
i
wonder
of
what
monday
night
i
saw
as
funny
and
as
pretty
a
bit
of
a
drama
this
afternoon
as
i
have
seen
for
a
long
time
faith
had
been
rolling
out
in
the
hot
hay
ever
since
three
o
clock
with
one
of
the
little
blands
and
when
the
shadows
grew
long
they
came
in
with
flushed
cheeks
and
tumbled
hair
to
rest
and
cool
upon
the
i
was
sitting
in
the
parlor
sewing
energetically
on
some
for
some
of
aunt
winifred
s
people
down
town
i
found
the
heat
to
be
more
bearable
if
i
kept
busy
and
could
see
unseen
all
the
little
into
which
the
two
children
grouped
themselves
a
new
one
every
instant
in
the
shadow
now
now
in
a
quiver
of
golden
glow
the
wind
tossing
their
hair
about
and
their
chatter
chiming
down
the
hall
like
bells
o
what
a
funny
little
sunset
there
s
going
to
be
behind
the
said
the
bland
in
a
pause
funny
enough
observed
faith
with
her
superior
smile
but
it
s
going
to
be
a
great
deal
funnier
up
in
heaven
i
tell
you
molly
funny
in
heaven
why
faith
molly
drew
herself
up
with
a
religious
air
and
looked
the
image
of
her
father
yes
to
be
sure
i
m
going
to
have
some
little
pink
blocks
made
out
of
it
when
i
go
pink
and
yellow
and
green
and
purple
and
o
so
many
blocks
i
m
going
to
have
a
little
red
cloud
to
sail
round
in
like
that
one
up
over
the
house
too
i
shouldn
t
molly
opened
her
eyes
o
i
don
t
believe
it
don
t
know
much
said
miss
faith
superbly
i
shouldn
t
s
pose
you
would
believe
it
p
r
aps
i
ll
have
some
strawberries
too
and
some
i
m
not
going
to
have
any
old
bread
and
butter
up
there
o
and
some
little
gold
apples
and
a
lot
of
playthings
nicer
playthings
why
nicer
than
they
have
in
the
shops
in
boston
molly
bland
god
s
keeping
em
up
there
a
dear
me
said
incredulous
molly
i
should
just
like
to
know
who
told
you
that
much
my
mother
never
told
it
at
me
did
your
mother
tell
it
at
you
o
she
told
me
some
of
it
and
the
rest
i
thinked
out
let
s
go
and
play
one
old
cat
said
molly
with
an
uncomfortable
jump
i
wish
i
hadn
t
got
to
go
to
heaven
why
molly
bland
why
i
think
heaven
s
splendid
i
ve
got
my
papa
up
there
you
know
here
s
my
little
girl
that
s
what
he
s
going
to
say
mamma
she
ll
be
there
too
and
we
re
all
going
to
live
in
the
prettiest
house
i
have
dreadful
hurries
to
go
this
afternoon
sometimes
when
phœbe
s
cross
and
won
t
give
me
sugar
they
don
t
let
you
in
though
nless
you
re
a
good
who
gets
it
all
up
asked
puzzled
molly
jesus
christ
will
give
me
all
these
beautiful
fings
said
faith
evidently
repeating
her
mother
s
words
the
only
catechism
that
she
has
been
taught
and
what
will
he
do
when
he
sees
you
asked
her
mother
coming
down
the
stairs
and
stepping
up
behind
her
take
me
up
in
his
arms
and
kiss
and
what
will
faith
say
you
said
the
child
softly
in
another
minute
she
was
absorbed
body
and
soul
in
the
mysteries
of
one
old
cat
but
i
don
t
think
she
will
feel
much
like
being
naughty
for
half
an
hour
to
come
her
mother
said
hear
how
pleasantly
her
words
drop
such
a
talk
quiets
her
like
a
hand
laid
on
her
head
mary
sometimes
i
think
it
is
his
very
hand
as
much
as
when
he
touched
those
other
little
children
i
wish
faith
to
feel
at
home
with
him
and
his
home
little
thing
i
really
do
not
think
that
she
is
conscious
of
any
fear
of
dying
i
do
not
think
it
means
anything
to
her
but
christ
and
her
father
and
pink
blocks
and
a
nice
time
and
never
disobeying
me
or
being
cross
many
a
time
she
wakes
me
up
in
the
morning
talking
away
to
herself
and
when
i
turn
and
look
at
her
she
says
o
mamma
won
t
we
go
to
heaven
you
fink
will
we
go
mamma
if
there
had
been
any
pink
blocks
and
for
me
when
i
was
at
her
age
i
should
not
have
prayed
every
night
to
die
i
think
the
horrors
of
death
that
children
live
through
unguessed
and
unrelieved
are
awful
faith
may
thank
you
all
her
life
that
she
has
escaped
i
should
feel
answerable
to
god
for
the
child
s
soul
if
i
had
not
prevented
that
i
always
wanted
to
know
what
sort
of
mother
that
poor
little
thing
had
who
asked
if
she
were
good
up
in
heaven
whether
they
wouldn
t
let
her
go
down
to
hell
saturday
afternoons
and
play
a
little
while
i
know
but
think
of
it
blocks
and
i
treat
faith
just
as
the
bible
treats
us
by
dealing
in
of
truth
that
she
can
understand
i
can
make
clo
and
abinadab
quirk
comprehend
that
their
pianos
and
machinery
may
not
be
made
of
literal
rosewood
and
steel
but
will
be
some
synonyme
of
the
thing
which
will
answer
just
such
wants
of
their
changed
natures
as
rosewood
and
steel
must
answer
now
there
will
be
machinery
and
pianos
in
the
same
sense
in
which
there
will
be
pearl
gates
and
harps
whatever
enjoyment
any
or
all
of
them
represent
now
something
will
represent
then
but
faith
if
i
told
her
that
her
heavenly
would
not
be
made
of
molasses
and
flour
would
have
a
cry
for
fear
that
she
was
not
going
to
have
any
at
all
so
until
she
is
older
i
give
her
unqualified
the
principal
joy
of
a
child
s
life
consists
in
eating
faith
begins
as
soon
as
the
light
wanes
to
dream
of
that
which
she
is
to
have
at
bedtime
i
don
t
suppose
she
can
outgrow
that
at
once
by
passing
out
of
her
little
round
body
she
must
begin
where
she
left
off
nothing
but
a
baby
though
it
will
be
as
holy
and
happy
a
baby
as
christ
can
make
it
when
she
says
mamma
i
shall
be
hungery
and
want
my
dinner
up
there
i
never
hesitate
to
tell
her
that
she
shall
have
her
dinner
she
would
never
in
her
secret
heart
though
she
might
not
have
the
honesty
to
say
so
expect
to
be
otherwise
than
miserable
in
a
dinnerless
you
are
not
afraid
of
misleading
the
child
s
fancy
not
so
long
as
i
can
keep
the
two
ideas
that
christ
is
her
best
friend
and
that
heaven
is
not
meant
for
naughty
girls
in
her
mind
and
i
sincerely
believe
that
he
would
give
her
the
very
pink
blocks
which
she
anticipates
no
less
than
he
would
give
back
a
poet
his
lost
dreams
or
you
your
brother
he
has
been
a
child
perhaps
incidentally
to
the
unsolved
mysteries
of
atonement
for
this
very
reason
that
he
may
know
how
to
prepare
their
places
for
them
whose
angels
do
always
behold
his
father
ah
you
may
be
sure
that
if
of
such
is
the
happy
kingdom
he
will
not
scorn
to
stoop
and
fit
it
to
their
little
needs
there
was
that
poor
little
fellow
whose
died
do
you
remember
only
half
what
was
it
o
mamma
he
sobbed
out
behind
his
handkerchief
don
t
great
big
elephants
have
souls
no
my
nor
camels
mamma
nor
bears
nor
alligators
nor
chickens
o
no
o
mamma
mamma
don
t
little
clean
have
souls
i
never
should
have
had
the
heart
to
say
no
to
that
especially
as
we
have
no
positive
proof
to
the
contrary
then
that
scrap
of
a
boy
who
lost
his
little
red
balloon
the
morning
he
bought
it
and
wanted
to
know
whether
it
had
gone
to
heaven
don
t
i
suppose
if
he
had
been
taken
there
himself
that
very
minute
that
he
would
have
found
a
little
balloon
in
waiting
for
him
how
can
i
help
it
it
has
a
pretty
sound
if
people
would
not
think
it
so
material
and
shocking
let
people
read
martin
luther
s
letter
to
his
little
boy
there
is
the
testimony
of
a
pillar
in
good
and
regular
standing
i
don
t
think
you
need
be
afraid
of
my
balloon
after
i
remembered
that
there
was
a
letter
of
his
on
heaven
but
not
recalling
it
distinctly
i
hunted
for
it
and
read
it
over
i
shall
copy
it
the
better
to
retain
it
in
mind
grace
and
peace
in
christ
my
dear
little
son
i
see
with
pleasure
that
thou
learnest
well
and
prayed
diligently
do
so
my
son
and
continue
when
i
come
home
i
will
bring
thee
a
pretty
fairing
i
know
a
pretty
merry
garden
wherein
are
many
children
they
have
little
golden
coats
and
they
gather
beautiful
apples
under
the
trees
and
pears
cherries
plums
and
they
sing
and
jump
and
are
merry
they
have
beautiful
little
horses
too
with
gold
bits
and
silver
saddles
and
i
asked
the
man
to
whom
the
garden
belongs
whose
children
they
were
and
he
said
they
are
the
children
that
love
to
pray
and
to
learn
and
are
then
said
i
dear
man
i
have
a
son
too
his
name
is
johnny
luther
may
he
not
also
come
into
this
garden
and
eat
these
beautiful
apples
and
pears
and
ride
these
fine
horses
then
the
man
said
if
he
loves
to
pray
and
to
learn
and
is
good
he
shall
come
into
this
garden
and
lippus
and
jost
too
and
when
they
all
come
together
they
shall
have
fifes
and
trumpets
lutes
and
all
sorts
of
music
and
they
shall
dance
and
shoot
with
little
and
he
showed
me
a
fine
meadow
there
in
the
garden
made
for
dancing
there
hung
nothing
but
golden
fifes
trumpets
and
fine
silver
but
it
was
early
and
the
children
had
not
yet
eaten
therefore
i
could
not
wait
the
dance
and
i
said
to
the
man
ah
dear
sir
i
will
immediately
go
and
write
all
this
to
my
little
son
johnny
and
tell
him
to
pray
diligently
and
to
learn
well
and
to
be
good
so
that
he
also
may
come
to
this
garden
but
he
has
an
aunt
lehne
he
must
bring
her
with
then
the
man
said
it
shall
be
so
go
and
write
him
therefore
my
dear
little
son
johnny
learn
and
pray
away
and
tell
lippus
and
jost
too
that
they
must
learn
and
pray
and
then
you
shall
come
to
the
garden
together
herewith
i
commend
thee
to
almighty
god
and
greet
aunt
lehne
and
give
her
a
kiss
for
my
sake
thy
dear
father
martinus
luther
anno
xiii
august
the
summer
is
sliding
quietly
away
my
desolate
summer
which
i
dreaded
with
the
dreams
gone
from
its
wild
flowers
the
crown
from
its
sunsets
the
thrill
from
its
winds
and
its
singing
but
i
have
found
out
a
thing
one
can
live
without
dreams
and
crowns
and
thrills
i
have
not
lost
them
they
lie
under
the
ivied
cross
with
roy
for
a
little
while
they
will
come
back
to
me
with
him
nothing
is
lost
she
teaches
me
and
until
they
come
back
i
see
for
she
shows
me
fields
groaning
under
their
white
harvest
with
laborers
very
few
ruth
followed
the
sturdy
reapers
gleaning
a
little
i
perhaps
can
do
as
much
the
ways
in
which
i
must
work
seem
so
small
and
insignificant
so
pitifully
trivial
sometimes
that
i
do
not
even
like
to
write
them
down
here
in
fact
they
are
so
small
that
six
months
ago
i
did
not
see
them
at
all
only
to
be
pleasant
to
old
phœbe
and
charitable
to
meta
tripp
and
faithful
to
my
very
interesting
little
scholars
and
a
bit
watchful
of
mrs
bland
and
but
dear
me
i
won
t
they
so
little
but
one
s
self
becomes
of
less
importance
which
seems
to
be
the
point
it
seems
very
strange
to
me
sometimes
looking
back
to
those
desperate
winter
days
what
a
change
has
come
over
my
thoughts
of
roy
not
that
he
is
any
less
o
never
any
less
to
me
but
it
is
almost
as
if
she
had
raised
him
from
the
grave
why
seek
ye
the
living
among
the
dead
her
soft
compassionate
eyes
shine
with
the
question
every
hour
and
every
hour
he
is
helping
me
ah
roy
we
understand
one
another
now
how
he
must
love
aunt
winifred
how
pleasant
the
days
will
be
when
we
can
talk
her
over
and
thank
her
together
to
be
happy
because
roy
is
i
remember
how
those
first
words
of
hers
struck
me
it
does
not
seem
to
me
impossible
now
aunt
winifred
and
i
laugh
at
each
other
for
talking
so
much
about
heaven
i
see
that
the
green
book
is
filled
with
my
questions
and
her
answers
the
fact
is
not
that
we
do
not
talk
as
much
about
mundane
affairs
as
other
people
but
that
this
one
thing
interests
us
more
if
instead
it
had
been
flounces
or
babies
or
german
philosophy
the
green
book
would
have
filled
itself
just
as
unconsciously
with
flounces
or
babies
or
german
philosophy
this
interest
in
heaven
is
of
course
no
sign
of
especial
piety
in
me
nor
could
people
with
young
warm
uncrushed
hopes
throbbing
through
their
days
be
expected
to
feel
the
same
it
is
only
the
old
principle
of
where
the
treasure
is
the
heart
how
mary
has
grown
mrs
bland
observes
regarding
me
respectfully
i
try
in
vain
to
laugh
her
out
of
the
conviction
if
roy
had
not
gone
before
i
should
think
no
more
probably
about
the
coming
life
than
does
the
minister
s
wife
herself
but
now
i
can
not
help
it
that
is
the
reality
this
the
dream
that
the
substance
this
the
shadow
the
other
day
aunt
winifred
and
i
had
a
talk
which
has
been
of
more
value
to
me
than
all
the
rest
faith
was
in
bed
it
was
a
cold
rainy
evening
we
were
secure
from
callers
we
lighted
a
few
kindlers
in
the
parlor
grate
she
rolled
up
the
and
i
took
my
cricket
at
her
feet
paul
at
the
feet
of
gamaliel
this
is
what
i
call
comfort
now
auntie
let
us
go
to
heaven
very
well
what
do
you
want
there
now
i
paused
a
moment
sobered
by
a
thought
that
has
been
growing
steadily
upon
me
of
late
something
more
aunt
winifred
all
these
other
things
are
beautiful
and
dear
but
i
believe
i
want
god
you
have
not
said
much
about
him
the
bible
says
a
great
deal
about
him
you
have
given
me
the
of
heaven
in
all
its
pleasant
promise
but
i
don
t
know
there
seems
to
be
an
outline
she
drew
my
hand
up
into
hers
smiling
i
have
not
done
my
painting
by
artistic
methods
i
know
but
it
was
not
exactly
accidental
tell
me
honestly
is
god
more
to
you
or
less
a
more
distinct
being
or
a
more
vague
one
than
he
was
six
months
ago
is
he
or
is
he
not
dearer
to
you
now
than
then
i
thought
about
it
a
minute
and
then
turned
my
face
up
to
her
mary
what
a
light
in
your
eyes
how
is
it
it
came
over
me
slowly
but
it
came
with
such
a
passion
of
gratitude
and
unworthiness
that
i
scarcely
knew
how
to
tell
her
that
he
never
has
been
to
me
in
all
my
life
what
he
is
now
at
the
end
of
these
six
months
he
was
once
an
abstract
grandeur
which
i
struggled
more
in
fear
than
love
to
please
he
has
become
a
living
presence
dear
and
real
no
dead
fact
stranded
on
the
shore
of
the
oblivious
years
but
warm
sweet
tender
even
yet
a
present
he
was
an
inexorable
mystery
who
took
roy
from
me
to
lose
him
in
the
glare
of
a
more
inexorable
heaven
he
is
a
father
who
knew
better
than
we
that
we
should
be
parted
for
a
while
but
he
only
means
it
to
be
a
little
while
he
is
keeping
him
for
me
to
find
in
the
flush
of
some
summer
morning
on
which
i
shall
open
my
eyes
no
less
naturally
than
i
open
them
on
june
sunrises
now
i
always
have
that
fancy
of
going
in
the
morning
she
understood
what
i
could
not
tell
her
and
said
i
thought
it
would
be
you
his
interpreter
have
done
it
i
answered
her
his
heaven
shows
what
he
is
don
t
you
see
like
a
friend
s
letter
i
could
no
more
go
back
to
my
old
groping
relations
to
him
than
i
could
make
of
you
the
dim
and
somewhat
apocryphal
western
auntie
that
you
were
before
i
saw
which
was
precisely
why
i
have
dealt
with
this
subject
as
i
have
she
said
you
had
all
your
life
been
directed
to
an
indefinite
heaven
where
the
glory
of
god
was
to
crowd
out
all
individuality
and
all
human
joy
from
his
most
individual
and
human
creatures
till
the
glory
of
god
had
become
nothing
but
a
name
and
a
dread
to
you
so
i
let
those
three
words
slide
by
and
tried
to
bring
you
to
them
as
christ
brought
the
twelve
to
believe
in
him
for
the
works
yes
my
child
clinging
human
loves
stifled
longings
cries
for
rest
forgotten
hopes
shall
have
their
answer
whatever
the
bewilderment
of
beauties
folded
away
for
us
in
heavenly
nature
and
art
they
shall
strive
with
each
other
to
make
us
glad
these
things
have
their
pleasant
place
but
through
eternity
there
will
be
always
something
beyond
and
dearer
than
the
dearest
of
them
god
himself
will
be
first
naturally
and
of
necessity
without
strain
or
struggle
when
i
sat
here
last
winter
with
my
dead
in
my
house
those
words
would
have
roused
in
me
an
agony
of
wild
questionings
i
should
have
beaten
about
them
and
beaten
against
them
and
cried
in
my
honest
heart
that
they
were
false
i
that
i
loved
roy
more
than
i
loved
such
a
being
as
god
seemed
to
me
then
to
be
now
they
strike
me
as
simply
and
pleasantly
true
the
more
i
love
roy
the
more
i
love
him
he
loves
us
both
you
see
it
could
not
be
otherwise
she
went
on
speaking
low
where
would
you
be
or
i
or
they
who
seem
to
us
so
much
dearer
and
better
than
ourselves
if
it
were
not
for
jesus
christ
what
can
heaven
be
to
us
but
a
song
of
the
love
that
is
the
same
to
us
yesterday
and
forever
that
in
the
mystery
of
an
intensity
which
we
shall
perhaps
never
understand
could
choose
death
and
be
glad
in
the
choosing
and
what
is
more
than
that
could
live
for
us
for
years
i
can
not
strain
my
faith
or
rather
my
common
sense
to
the
rhapsodies
with
which
many
people
fill
heaven
but
it
seems
to
me
like
this
a
friend
goes
away
from
us
and
it
may
be
seas
or
worlds
that
lie
between
us
and
we
love
him
he
leaves
behind
him
his
little
keepsakes
a
lock
of
hair
to
curl
about
our
fingers
a
picture
that
has
caught
the
trick
of
his
eyes
or
smile
a
book
a
flower
a
letter
what
we
do
with
the
curling
hair
what
we
say
to
the
picture
what
we
dream
over
the
flower
and
the
letter
nobody
knows
but
ourselves
people
have
risked
life
for
such
mementoes
yet
who
loves
the
senseless
gift
more
than
the
giver
the
curl
more
than
the
young
forehead
on
which
it
fell
the
letter
more
than
the
hand
which
traced
it
so
it
seems
to
me
that
we
shall
learn
to
see
in
god
the
centre
of
all
possibilities
of
joy
the
greatest
of
these
lesser
delights
is
but
the
greater
measure
of
his
friendship
they
will
not
mean
less
of
pleasure
but
more
of
him
they
will
not
pale
as
dr
bland
would
say
human
dearness
will
wax
not
wane
in
heaven
but
human
friends
will
be
loved
for
love
of
i
see
that
helps
me
like
a
torch
in
a
dark
room
but
there
will
be
shadows
in
the
corners
do
you
suppose
that
we
shall
ever
feel
it
in
the
body
in
the
body
probably
not
we
see
through
a
glass
so
darkly
that
the
temptation
to
idolatry
is
always
our
greatest
golden
images
did
not
die
with
paganism
at
times
i
fancy
that
somewhere
between
this
world
and
another
a
revelation
will
come
upon
us
like
a
flash
of
what
really
is
such
a
revelation
lighting
up
the
lurid
background
of
our
past
in
such
colors
that
the
consciousness
of
what
christ
has
done
for
us
will
be
for
a
time
as
much
as
heart
can
bear
after
that
the
mystery
will
be
not
how
to
love
him
most
but
that
we
ever
have
loved
any
creature
or
thing
as
we
serve
god
quite
as
much
by
active
work
as
by
special
prayer
here
i
said
after
some
thought
how
will
it
be
there
we
must
be
busily
at
work
certainly
but
i
think
there
must
naturally
be
more
communion
with
him
then
now
this
phrase
communion
with
god
has
been
worn
and
not
always
well
worn
prayer
means
to
us
in
this
life
more
often
penitent
confession
than
happy
interchange
of
thought
with
him
it
is
associated
too
with
aching
limbs
and
sleepy
eyes
and
nights
when
the
lamp
goes
out
obstacles
moral
and
physical
stand
in
the
way
of
our
knowing
exactly
what
it
may
mean
in
the
ideal
of
it
my
best
conception
of
it
lies
in
the
of
the
man
christ
jesus
i
suppose
he
will
bear
with
him
eternally
the
humanity
which
he
took
up
with
him
from
the
judean
hills
i
imagine
that
we
shall
see
him
in
visible
form
like
ourselves
among
us
yet
not
of
us
that
he
himself
is
gott
mit
ihnen
that
we
shall
talk
with
him
as
a
man
talketh
with
his
friend
perhaps
bowed
and
hushed
at
his
dear
feet
we
shall
hear
from
his
own
lips
the
story
of
nazareth
of
bethany
of
golgotha
of
the
chilly
mountains
where
he
used
to
pray
all
night
long
for
us
of
the
desert
places
where
he
hungered
of
his
cry
for
help
think
mary
when
there
was
not
one
in
all
the
world
to
hear
it
and
there
was
silence
in
heaven
while
angels
strengthened
him
and
man
forsook
him
perhaps
his
voice
the
very
voice
which
has
sounded
whispering
through
our
troubled
life
could
ye
not
watch
one
hour
shall
unfold
its
perplexed
meanings
shall
make
its
rough
places
plain
shall
show
us
step
by
step
the
merciful
way
by
which
he
led
us
to
the
hour
shall
point
out
to
us
joy
by
joy
the
surprises
that
he
has
been
planning
for
us
just
as
the
old
father
in
the
story
planned
to
surprise
his
wayward
boy
come
home
and
such
a
communion
which
is
not
too
much
nor
yet
enough
to
dare
to
expect
of
a
god
who
was
the
friend
of
abraham
who
walked
with
enoch
who
did
not
call
fishermen
his
servants
will
be
that
presence
of
god
that
adoration
on
which
we
have
looked
from
afar
off
with
despairing
eyes
that
wept
they
were
so
dazzled
and
turned
themselves
away
as
from
the
thing
they
greatly
i
think
we
neither
of
us
cared
to
talk
for
a
while
after
this
something
made
me
forget
even
that
i
was
going
to
see
roy
in
heaven
years
the
words
rang
themselves
over
it
is
on
the
humanity
of
christ
she
said
after
some
musing
that
all
my
other
reasons
for
hoping
for
such
a
heaven
as
i
hope
for
rest
for
foundation
he
knows
exactly
what
we
are
for
he
has
been
one
of
us
exactly
what
we
hope
and
fear
and
crave
for
he
has
hoped
and
feared
and
craved
not
the
less
humanly
but
only
more
intensely
it
were
not
do
you
take
in
the
thoughtful
tenderness
of
that
a
mother
stilling
her
frightened
child
in
the
dark
might
speak
just
so
it
were
not
so
i
would
have
told
that
brooding
love
makes
room
for
all
that
we
can
want
he
has
sounded
every
deep
of
a
troubled
and
tempted
life
who
so
sure
as
he
to
understand
how
to
prepare
a
place
where
troubled
and
tempted
lives
may
grow
serene
further
than
this
since
he
stands
as
our
great
type
no
less
in
death
and
after
than
before
it
he
answers
for
us
many
of
these
lesser
questions
on
the
event
of
which
so
much
of
our
happiness
depends
shall
we
lose
our
personality
in
a
vague
ocean
of
ether
you
one
puff
of
gas
i
another
he
with
his
own
wounded
body
rose
and
ate
and
walked
and
talked
is
all
memory
of
this
life
to
be
swept
away
he
arisen
has
forgotten
nothing
he
waits
to
meet
his
disciples
at
the
old
familiar
places
as
naturally
as
if
he
had
never
been
parted
from
them
he
falls
in
with
the
current
of
their
thoughts
has
any
one
troubled
us
with
fears
that
in
the
glorified
crowds
of
heaven
we
may
miss
a
face
dearer
than
all
the
world
to
us
he
made
himself
known
to
his
friends
mary
and
the
two
at
emmaus
and
the
bewildered
group
praying
and
perplexed
in
their
bolted
room
do
we
weary
ourselves
with
speculations
whether
human
loves
can
outlive
the
shock
of
death
mary
knew
how
he
loved
her
when
turning
she
heard
him
call
her
by
her
name
they
knew
whose
hearts
burned
within
them
while
he
talked
with
them
by
the
way
and
when
he
tarried
with
them
the
day
being
far
and
for
the
rest
for
the
rest
about
which
he
was
silent
we
can
trust
him
and
if
trusting
we
please
ourselves
with
fancies
he
would
be
the
last
to
think
it
blame
to
us
there
is
one
promise
which
grows
upon
me
the
more
i
study
it
he
that
spared
not
his
own
son
how
shall
he
not
also
him
freely
give
us
all
sometimes
i
wonder
if
that
does
not
infold
a
beautiful
a
hint
of
much
that
you
and
i
have
conjectured
as
one
throws
down
a
hint
of
a
surprise
to
a
child
then
there
is
that
pledge
to
those
who
seek
first
his
kingdom
these
things
shall
be
added
unto
these
things
were
food
and
clothing
were
varieties
of
material
delight
and
the
words
were
spoken
to
men
who
lived
hungry
beggared
and
died
the
death
of
outcasts
if
this
passage
could
be
taken
literally
it
would
be
very
significant
in
its
bearing
on
the
future
life
for
christ
must
keep
his
promise
to
the
letter
in
one
world
or
another
it
may
be
wrenching
the
verse
not
as
a
verse
but
from
the
grain
of
the
argument
to
insist
on
the
literal
interpretation
though
i
am
not
xiv
august
i
asked
the
other
day
wondering
whether
all
ministers
were
like
dr
bland
what
uncle
forceythe
used
to
believe
about
heaven
very
much
what
i
do
she
said
these
questions
were
brought
home
to
him
early
in
life
by
the
death
of
a
very
dear
sister
he
had
thought
much
about
them
i
think
one
of
the
things
that
so
much
attached
his
people
to
him
was
the
way
he
had
of
weaving
their
future
life
in
with
this
till
it
grew
naturally
and
pleasantly
into
their
frequent
thought
o
yes
your
uncle
supplied
me
with
half
of
my
aunt
winifred
has
not
looked
quite
well
of
late
i
fancy
though
it
may
be
only
fancy
she
has
not
spoken
of
it
except
one
day
when
i
told
her
that
she
looked
pale
it
was
the
heat
she
said
little
clo
came
over
i
believe
she
thinks
aunt
winifred
the
best
friend
she
has
in
the
world
auntie
has
become
much
attached
to
all
her
scholars
and
has
a
rare
power
of
winning
her
way
into
their
confidence
they
come
to
her
with
all
their
little
interests
everything
from
saving
their
souls
to
trimming
a
bonnet
clo
however
is
the
favorite
as
i
predicted
she
looked
a
bit
blue
as
girls
will
look
in
fact
her
face
always
has
a
tinge
of
sadness
about
it
aunt
winifred
understanding
at
a
glance
that
the
child
was
not
in
a
mood
to
talk
before
a
third
led
her
away
into
the
garden
and
they
were
gone
a
long
time
when
it
grew
dark
i
saw
them
coming
up
the
path
clo
s
hand
locked
in
her
teacher
s
and
her
face
which
was
wet
upturned
like
a
child
s
they
strolled
to
the
gate
lingered
a
little
to
talk
and
then
clo
said
good
night
without
coming
in
auntie
sat
for
a
while
after
she
had
gone
thinking
her
over
i
could
see
poor
thing
she
said
at
last
half
to
herself
half
to
me
poor
little
foolish
thing
this
is
where
the
dreadful
individuality
of
a
human
soul
irks
me
there
comes
a
point
beyond
which
you
help
what
has
happened
to
clo
nothing
lately
it
has
been
happening
for
two
years
two
miserable
years
are
an
eternity
at
clo
s
age
it
is
the
old
story
a
summer
boarder
a
little
flirting
a
little
dreaming
a
little
pain
then
autumn
and
the
nuts
dropping
on
the
leaves
and
he
was
gone
and
knew
not
what
he
did
and
the
child
waked
up
there
was
the
future
to
bake
and
sweep
to
go
to
and
sing
in
the
choir
and
bear
the
moonlight
nights
and
she
loved
him
she
has
lived
through
two
years
of
it
and
she
loves
him
now
reason
will
not
reach
such
a
passion
in
a
girl
like
clo
i
did
not
tell
her
that
she
would
put
it
away
with
other
girlish
things
and
laugh
at
it
herself
some
happy
day
as
women
have
laughed
at
their
young
fancies
before
her
partly
because
that
would
be
a
certain
way
of
repelling
her
confidence
she
does
not
believe
it
and
my
believing
could
not
make
her
partly
because
i
am
not
quite
sure
about
it
myself
clo
has
a
good
deal
of
the
woman
about
her
her
introspective
life
is
intense
she
may
cherish
this
sweet
misery
as
she
does
her
musical
tastes
till
it
has
struck
deep
root
there
is
nothing
in
the
excellent
bentley
s
household
nor
in
homer
anywhere
to
draw
the
girl
out
from
herself
in
time
to
prevent
the
dream
from
becoming
a
poor
little
thing
what
did
you
say
to
her
you
ought
to
have
heard
what
she
said
to
me
i
wish
i
were
at
liberty
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
what
troubles
her
most
is
that
it
is
not
going
to
help
the
matter
any
to
die
o
forceythe
she
says
in
a
tone
that
is
enough
to
give
the
even
to
such
an
old
woman
as
forceythe
o
forceythe
what
is
going
to
become
of
me
up
there
he
never
loved
me
you
see
and
he
never
never
will
and
he
will
have
some
beautiful
good
wife
of
his
own
and
i
won
t
have
for
i
can
t
love
anybody
else
i
ve
tried
i
tried
just
as
hard
as
i
could
to
love
my
cousin
bin
he
s
real
good
and
i
m
afraid
bin
likes
me
though
i
guess
he
likes
his
better
o
sometimes
i
think
and
think
till
it
seems
as
if
i
could
not
bear
it
i
don
t
see
how
god
can
me
happy
i
wish
i
could
be
buried
up
and
go
to
sleep
and
never
have
any
heaven
and
you
told
her
that
she
should
have
him
there
that
is
if
not
himself
something
somebody
who
would
so
much
more
than
fill
his
place
that
she
would
never
have
a
lonely
or
unloved
minute
her
eyes
brightened
and
shaded
and
pondered
doubting
she
didn
t
see
how
it
could
ever
i
told
her
not
to
try
and
see
how
but
to
leave
it
to
christ
he
knew
all
about
this
little
trouble
of
hers
and
he
would
make
it
right
will
he
she
questioned
sighing
but
there
are
so
many
of
us
there
s
bin
and
a
plenty
more
and
i
don
t
see
how
it
s
going
to
be
smoothed
out
everything
is
in
a
jumble
forceythe
don
t
you
see
for
some
people
like
and
keep
liking
so
many
something
came
into
my
mind
about
the
rough
places
that
shall
be
made
plain
and
the
crooked
things
straight
i
tried
to
explain
to
her
and
at
last
i
kissed
away
her
tears
and
sent
her
home
if
not
exactly
comforted
a
little
less
miserable
i
think
than
when
she
came
ah
well
i
wonder
myself
sometimes
about
these
crooked
things
but
though
i
wonder
i
never
she
finished
her
sentence
somewhat
hurriedly
and
half
started
from
her
chair
raising
both
hands
with
a
quick
involuntary
motion
that
attracted
my
notice
the
lights
came
in
just
then
and
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
her
face
showed
paler
than
usual
but
when
i
asked
her
if
she
felt
faint
she
said
o
no
i
believe
i
am
a
little
tired
and
will
go
to
september
i
am
glad
that
the
summer
is
over
this
heat
has
certainly
worn
on
aunt
winifred
with
that
kind
of
wear
which
slides
people
into
confirmed
invalidism
i
suppose
she
would
bear
it
in
her
saintly
way
as
she
bears
everything
but
it
would
be
a
bitter
cup
for
her
i
know
she
was
always
pale
but
this
is
a
paleness
which
night
a
dreadful
thing
has
happened
i
was
in
the
middle
of
my
sentence
when
i
heard
a
commotion
in
the
street
and
a
child
s
voice
shouting
incoherently
something
about
the
doctor
and
s
killed
o
mother
s
killed
mother
s
burnt
to
death
i
was
at
the
window
in
time
to
see
a
girl
running
wildly
past
the
house
and
to
see
that
it
was
molly
bland
at
the
same
moment
i
saw
aunt
winifred
snatching
her
hat
from
its
nail
in
the
entry
she
beckoned
to
me
to
follow
and
we
were
over
to
the
parsonage
before
i
had
a
distinct
thought
of
what
i
was
about
we
came
upon
a
horrible
scene
dr
bland
was
trying
to
do
everything
alone
there
was
not
a
woman
in
the
house
to
help
him
for
they
have
never
been
able
to
keep
a
servant
and
none
of
the
neighbors
had
had
time
to
be
there
before
us
the
poor
husband
was
growing
faint
i
think
aunt
winifred
saw
by
a
look
that
he
could
not
bear
much
more
sent
him
after
molly
for
the
doctor
and
took
everything
meantime
into
her
own
charge
i
shall
not
write
down
a
word
of
it
it
was
a
sight
that
once
seen
will
never
leave
me
as
long
as
i
live
my
nerves
are
thoroughly
shaken
by
it
and
it
must
be
put
out
of
thought
as
far
as
possible
it
seems
that
the
little
boy
the
baby
crept
into
the
kitchen
by
himself
and
began
to
throw
the
contents
of
the
on
the
stove
to
make
a
bonfire
the
poor
little
fellow
said
in
five
minutes
his
apron
was
ablaze
his
mother
was
on
the
spot
at
his
first
cry
and
smothered
the
little
apron
and
saved
the
child
but
her
dress
was
muslin
and
everybody
was
too
far
off
to
hear
her
at
first
and
by
the
time
her
husband
came
in
from
the
garden
it
was
too
late
she
is
living
yet
her
husband
pacing
the
room
back
and
forth
and
crouching
on
his
knees
by
the
hour
is
praying
god
to
let
her
die
before
the
morning
morning
there
is
no
chance
of
life
the
doctor
says
but
he
has
been
able
to
find
something
that
has
lessened
her
sufferings
she
lies
partially
unconscious
wednesday
night
aunt
winifred
and
i
were
over
at
the
parsonage
when
she
roused
a
little
from
her
stupor
and
recognized
us
she
spoke
to
her
husband
and
kissed
me
good
by
and
asked
for
the
children
they
were
playing
softly
in
the
next
room
we
sent
for
them
and
they
came
in
the
four
unconscious
motherless
little
things
with
the
sunlight
in
their
hair
the
bitterness
of
death
came
into
her
marred
face
at
sight
of
them
and
she
raised
her
hands
to
auntie
to
the
only
other
mother
there
with
a
sudden
helpless
cry
i
could
bear
it
i
could
bear
it
if
it
weren
t
for
without
any
mother
all
their
lives
such
little
things
and
to
go
away
where
i
can
t
do
a
single
for
them
aunt
winifred
stooped
down
and
spoke
low
but
decidedly
you
do
for
them
god
knows
all
about
it
he
will
not
send
you
away
from
them
you
shall
be
just
as
much
their
mother
every
day
of
their
lives
as
you
have
been
here
perhaps
there
is
something
to
do
for
them
which
you
never
could
have
done
here
he
sees
he
loves
them
he
loves
if
i
could
paint
i
might
paint
the
look
that
struck
through
and
through
that
woman
s
dying
face
but
words
can
not
touch
it
if
i
were
aunt
winifred
i
should
bless
god
on
my
knees
for
having
shown
me
how
to
give
such
ease
to
a
soul
in
death
thursday
morning
god
is
merciful
mrs
bland
died
at
five
o
clock
how
such
a
voice
from
the
heavens
shocks
one
out
of
the
repose
of
calm
sorrows
and
of
calm
joys
this
has
come
and
gone
so
suddenly
that
i
can
not
adjust
it
to
any
quiet
and
trustful
thinking
yet
the
whole
parish
mourns
excitedly
for
though
they
worked
their
minister
s
wife
hard
they
loved
her
well
i
can
not
talk
it
over
with
the
rest
it
jars
horror
should
never
be
dissected
besides
my
heart
is
too
full
of
those
four
little
children
with
the
sunlight
in
their
hair
and
the
unconsciousness
in
their
eyes
quirk
came
over
in
great
perplexity
she
had
just
come
from
the
minister
s
i
don
t
know
what
we
re
a
goin
to
do
with
him
she
exclaimed
in
a
gush
of
impatient
uncomprehending
sympathy
you
can
t
let
a
man
take
on
that
way
much
longer
he
ll
worry
himself
sick
and
then
we
shall
either
lose
him
or
have
to
pay
his
bills
to
europe
why
he
jest
stops
in
the
house
and
walks
his
study
up
and
down
day
and
night
or
else
he
jest
sets
and
sets
and
don
t
notice
nobody
but
the
children
now
i
ve
jest
ben
over
makin
him
some
he
used
to
set
a
sight
by
my
and
he
made
believe
to
eat
it
cause
i
d
ben
at
the
trouble
i
suppose
but
how
much
do
you
suppose
he
swallowed
jest
three
mouthfuls
thinks
says
i
i
won
t
spend
my
time
over
for
the
afflicted
agin
and
on
too
when
i
knocked
at
the
study
door
he
said
come
in
and
stopped
his
walkin
and
turned
as
quick
o
says
he
good
morning
i
thought
it
was
i
told
him
no
i
wasn
t
forceythe
but
i
d
come
to
comfort
him
in
his
sorrer
all
the
same
but
that
s
the
only
thing
i
have
agin
our
minister
he
won
t
comforted
mary
ann
jacobs
who
s
ben
there
kind
of
looking
after
the
children
and
things
for
him
you
know
sence
the
funeral
she
says
he
s
asked
three
or
four
times
for
you
forceythe
there
s
ben
plenty
of
his
people
in
to
see
him
but
you
haven
t
ben
nigh
him
mary
ann
i
stayed
away
because
i
thought
the
presence
of
friends
at
this
time
would
be
an
intrusion
auntie
said
but
if
he
would
like
to
see
me
that
alters
the
case
i
will
go
i
don
t
know
suggested
quirk
looking
over
the
tops
of
her
spectacles
i
s
pose
it
s
proper
enough
but
you
bein
a
widow
you
know
and
his
wife
aunt
winifred
s
eyes
shot
fire
she
stood
up
and
turned
upon
quirk
with
a
look
the
like
of
which
i
presume
that
worthy
lady
had
never
seen
before
and
is
not
likely
to
see
soon
again
it
gave
the
beautiful
scorn
of
a
zenobia
to
her
fair
slight
face
moved
her
lips
slightly
but
said
nothing
put
on
her
bonnet
and
went
straight
to
bland
s
the
minister
they
told
her
was
in
his
study
she
knocked
lightly
at
the
door
and
was
bidden
in
a
lifeless
voice
to
enter
shades
and
blinds
were
drawn
and
the
glare
of
the
sun
quite
shut
out
dr
bland
sat
by
his
with
his
face
upon
his
hands
a
bible
lay
open
before
him
it
had
been
lately
used
the
leaves
were
wet
he
raised
his
head
dejectedly
but
smiled
when
he
saw
who
it
was
he
had
been
thinking
about
her
he
said
and
was
glad
that
she
had
come
i
do
not
know
all
that
passed
between
them
but
i
gather
from
such
hints
as
auntie
in
her
unconsciousness
throws
out
that
she
had
things
to
say
which
touched
some
comfortless
places
in
the
man
s
heart
no
greek
and
hebrew
original
no
polished
dogma
no
link
in
his
stereotyped
logic
not
one
of
his
eloquent
sermons
on
the
future
state
came
to
his
relief
these
were
meant
for
happy
days
they
rang
cold
as
steel
upon
the
warm
needs
of
an
afflicted
man
brought
face
to
face
and
sharply
with
the
blank
heaven
of
his
belief
he
stood
up
from
before
his
dead
and
groped
about
it
and
cried
out
against
it
in
the
bitterness
of
his
soul
i
had
no
chance
to
prepare
myself
to
bow
to
the
will
of
god
he
said
his
reserved
ministerial
manner
in
curious
contrast
with
the
caged
way
in
which
he
was
pacing
the
room
i
had
no
chance
i
am
taken
by
surprise
as
by
a
thief
in
the
night
i
had
a
great
deal
to
say
to
her
and
there
was
no
time
she
could
tell
me
what
to
do
with
my
poor
little
children
i
wanted
to
tell
her
other
things
i
wanted
to
tell
her
perhaps
we
all
of
us
have
our
regrets
when
the
lord
removes
our
friends
we
may
have
done
or
left
undone
many
things
we
might
have
made
them
happier
my
mind
does
not
rest
with
assurance
in
its
conceptions
of
the
heavenly
state
if
i
never
can
tell
her
he
stopped
abruptly
and
paced
into
the
darkest
shadows
of
the
shadowed
room
his
face
turned
away
you
said
once
some
pleasant
things
about
heaven
he
said
at
last
half
appealingly
stopping
in
front
of
her
hesitating
like
a
man
and
like
a
minister
hardly
ready
to
come
with
all
the
learning
of
his
schools
and
commentators
and
sit
at
the
feet
of
a
woman
she
talked
with
him
for
a
time
in
her
unobtrusive
way
deferring
when
she
honestly
could
to
his
clerical
judgment
and
careful
not
to
wound
him
by
any
word
but
frankly
and
clearly
as
she
always
talks
when
she
rose
to
go
he
thanked
her
quietly
this
is
a
somewhat
novel
train
of
thought
to
me
he
said
i
hope
it
may
not
prove
an
unscriptural
one
i
have
been
reading
the
book
of
revelation
with
these
questions
especially
in
mind
we
are
never
too
old
to
learn
some
passages
may
be
capable
of
other
interpretations
than
i
have
formerly
given
them
no
matter
what
i
you
see
i
must
be
guided
by
the
word
of
my
auntie
says
that
she
never
respected
the
man
so
much
as
she
did
when
hearing
those
words
she
looked
up
into
his
haggard
face
convulsed
with
its
human
pain
and
longing
i
hope
you
do
not
think
that
am
not
guided
by
the
word
of
god
she
answered
i
mean
to
i
know
you
mean
to
be
he
said
cordially
i
do
not
say
that
you
are
not
i
may
come
to
see
that
you
are
and
that
you
are
right
it
will
be
a
peaceful
day
for
me
if
i
can
ever
quite
agree
with
your
methods
of
reasoning
but
i
must
think
these
things
over
i
thank
you
once
more
for
coming
your
sympathy
is
grateful
to
just
as
she
closed
the
door
he
called
her
back
see
he
said
with
a
saddened
smile
at
least
i
shall
never
preach
again
it
seems
to
me
that
life
is
always
undoing
for
us
something
that
we
have
just
laboriously
he
held
up
before
her
a
mass
of
old
blue
manuscript
and
threw
it
as
he
spoke
upon
the
embers
left
in
his
grate
it
smoked
and
blazed
up
and
burned
out
it
was
that
sermon
on
heaven
of
which
there
is
an
abstract
in
this
journal
aunt
winifred
hired
tripp
s
gray
this
afternoon
and
drove
to
east
homer
on
some
unexplained
errand
she
did
not
invite
me
to
go
with
her
and
faith
though
she
teased
impressively
was
left
at
home
her
mother
was
gone
till
late
so
late
that
i
had
begun
to
be
anxious
about
her
and
heard
through
the
dark
the
first
sound
of
the
buggy
wheels
with
great
relief
she
looked
very
tired
when
i
met
her
at
the
gate
she
had
not
been
able
she
said
to
accomplish
her
errand
at
east
homer
and
from
there
had
gone
to
worcester
by
railroad
leaving
old
gray
at
the
east
homer
eagle
till
her
return
she
told
me
nothing
more
and
i
asked
no
questions
xv
sunday
faith
has
behaved
like
a
witch
all
day
she
knocked
down
three
crickets
and
six
in
church
this
morning
and
this
afternoon
horrified
the
assembled
and
devout
congregation
by
turning
round
in
the
middle
of
the
long
prayer
and
in
a
loud
and
distinct
voice
asking
quirk
for
nother
those
pepp
mints
such
as
you
gave
me
one
sunday
a
good
many
years
ago
you
after
church
her
mother
tried
a
few
bible
questions
to
keep
her
still
faith
who
was
christ
s
father
jerusalem
said
faith
promptly
where
did
his
parents
take
jesus
when
they
fled
from
herod
o
to
europe
of
course
i
knew
that
everybody
goes
to
when
her
mother
had
put
her
to
bed
she
came
down
laughing
faith
does
seem
to
have
a
hard
time
with
the
lord
s
prayer
being
very
sleepy
and
in
a
hurry
to
finish
she
proceeded
with
great
solemnity
our
father
who
art
in
heaven
hallowed
be
thy
name
six
days
shalt
thou
labor
and
do
all
thy
work
and
oh
i
was
just
thinking
how
amused
her
father
must
auntie
says
many
such
things
i
can
not
explain
how
pleasantly
they
strike
me
nor
how
they
help
me
dr
bland
gave
us
a
good
sermon
yesterday
there
is
an
indescribable
change
in
all
his
sermons
there
is
a
change
too
in
the
man
and
that
something
more
than
the
haggardness
of
grief
i
not
only
respect
him
and
am
sorry
for
him
but
i
feel
more
ready
to
be
taught
by
him
than
ever
before
a
certain
indefinable
softens
his
eyes
and
tones
and
seems
to
be
creeping
into
everything
that
he
says
yet
on
the
other
hand
his
people
say
that
they
have
never
heard
him
speak
such
pleasant
helpful
things
concerning
his
and
their
relations
to
god
i
met
him
the
other
night
coming
away
from
his
wife
s
grave
and
was
struck
by
the
expression
of
his
face
i
wondered
if
he
were
not
slowly
finding
the
peaceful
day
of
which
he
told
aunt
winifred
she
by
the
way
has
taken
another
of
her
mysterious
trips
to
worcester
we
were
wondering
where
it
will
be
i
mean
heaven
it
is
impossible
to
do
more
than
wonder
auntie
said
though
we
are
explicitly
told
that
there
will
be
new
heavens
a
new
earth
which
seems
if
anything
can
be
taken
literally
in
the
bible
to
point
to
this
world
as
the
future
home
of
at
least
some
of
not
for
all
of
us
of
course
i
don
t
feel
sure
i
know
that
somebody
spent
his
valuable
time
in
estimating
that
all
the
people
who
have
lived
and
died
upon
the
earth
would
cover
it
alive
or
buried
twice
over
but
i
know
that
somebody
else
claims
with
equal
solemnity
to
have
discovered
that
they
could
all
be
buried
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
but
it
would
be
of
little
consequence
if
we
could
not
all
find
room
here
since
there
must
be
other
provision
for
why
certainly
there
is
a
place
in
which
we
are
promised
that
we
shall
be
with
christ
this
world
being
yet
the
great
theatre
of
human
life
and
of
satan
no
place
certainly
in
which
to
confine
a
happy
soul
without
prospect
of
release
the
spiritualistic
notion
of
circles
of
dead
friends
revolving
over
us
is
to
me
intolerable
i
want
my
husband
with
me
when
i
need
him
but
i
hope
he
has
a
place
to
be
happy
in
which
is
out
of
this
woful
world
the
old
astronomical
idea
stars
around
a
sun
and
systems
around
a
centre
and
that
centre
the
throne
of
god
is
not
an
unreasonable
one
isaac
taylor
among
his
various
conjectures
inclines
i
fancy
to
suppose
that
the
sun
of
each
system
is
the
heaven
of
that
system
though
the
glory
of
god
may
be
more
directly
and
impressively
exhibited
in
one
place
than
in
another
we
may
live
in
different
planets
and
some
of
us
after
its
destruction
and
renovation
on
this
same
dear
old
happy
and
miserable
loved
and
maltreated
earth
i
hope
i
shall
be
one
of
them
i
should
like
to
come
back
and
build
me
a
beautiful
home
in
kansas
i
mean
in
what
was
kansas
among
the
happy
people
and
the
familiar
transfigured
spots
where
john
and
i
worked
for
god
so
long
together
that
with
my
dear
lord
to
see
and
speak
with
every
day
would
be
heaven
our
there
will
be
no
then
there
will
be
succession
of
time
there
may
not
be
alternations
of
hours
dark
or
light
but
i
use
with
thee
an
earthly
language
as
the
wife
said
in
that
beautiful
little
awakening
of
therrmin
s
do
you
remember
it
do
read
it
over
if
you
haven
t
read
it
lately
as
to
our
coming
back
here
there
is
an
echo
to
peter
s
assertion
in
the
idea
of
a
world
under
a
curse
destroyed
and
regenerated
the
atonement
of
christ
reaching
with
something
more
than
poetic
force
the
very
sands
of
the
earth
which
he
trod
with
bleeding
feet
to
make
himself
its
saviour
that
makes
me
feel
don
t
you
see
what
a
taint
there
is
in
sin
if
dumb
dust
is
to
have
such
awful
cleansing
what
must
be
needed
for
you
and
me
how
many
pleasant
talks
we
have
had
about
these
things
mary
well
it
can
not
be
long
at
the
longest
before
we
know
even
as
we
are
i
looked
at
her
smiling
white
face
it
is
always
very
white
now
and
something
struck
slowly
through
me
like
a
chill
october
midnight
there
is
no
such
thing
as
sleep
at
present
writing
is
better
than
thinking
aunt
winifred
went
again
to
worcester
she
said
that
she
had
to
buy
trimming
for
faith
s
sack
she
went
alone
as
usual
and
faith
and
i
kept
each
other
company
through
the
afternoon
she
on
the
floor
with
mary
ann
i
in
the
with
macaulay
as
the
light
began
to
fall
level
on
the
floor
i
threw
the
book
aside
being
at
the
end
of
a
volume
and
mary
ann
having
exhausted
her
attractions
i
surrendered
unconditionally
to
the
little
maiden
she
took
me
up
garret
and
down
cellar
on
lop
of
the
and
into
the
i
fathomed
the
mysteries
of
old
man
s
castle
and
still
palm
i
was
her
grandmother
i
was
her
baby
i
was
a
rabbit
i
was
a
chestnut
horse
i
was
a
i
was
a
giant
i
was
a
bear
warranted
not
to
eat
little
girls
i
was
a
roaring
hippopotamus
and
a
canary
bird
i
was
jeff
davis
and
i
was
moses
in
the
bulrushes
and
of
what
i
was
the
time
faileth
me
to
tell
it
comes
over
me
with
a
curious
mingled
sense
of
the
ludicrous
and
the
horrible
that
i
should
have
spent
the
afternoon
like
a
baby
and
almost
as
happily
laughing
out
with
the
child
past
and
future
forgotten
the
tremendous
risks
of
i
spy
absorbing
all
my
present
while
what
was
happening
was
happening
and
what
was
to
come
was
coming
not
an
echo
in
the
air
not
a
prophecy
in
the
sunshine
not
a
note
of
warning
in
the
song
of
the
robins
that
watched
me
from
the
as
the
long
golden
afternoon
slid
away
we
came
out
by
the
front
gate
to
watch
for
the
child
s
mother
i
was
tired
and
lying
back
on
the
grass
gave
faith
some
pink
and
purple
larkspurs
that
she
might
amuse
herself
in
making
a
chain
of
them
the
picture
that
she
made
sitting
there
on
the
short
dying
grass
the
light
which
broke
all
about
her
and
over
her
at
the
first
creeping
slowly
down
and
away
to
the
west
her
little
fingers
linking
the
rich
bright
flowers
tube
into
tube
the
dimple
on
her
cheek
and
the
love
in
her
eyes
has
photographed
itself
into
my
thinking
how
her
voice
rang
out
when
the
wheels
sounded
at
last
and
the
carriage
somewhat
slowly
driven
stopped
mamma
mamma
see
what
i
ve
got
for
you
mamma
auntie
tried
to
step
from
the
carriage
and
called
me
mary
can
you
help
me
a
little
i
am
i
went
to
her
and
she
leaned
heavily
on
my
arm
and
we
came
up
the
path
such
a
pretty
little
chain
all
for
you
mamma
began
faith
and
stopped
struck
by
her
mother
s
look
it
has
been
a
long
ride
and
i
am
in
pain
i
believe
i
will
lie
right
down
on
the
parlor
sofa
mary
would
you
be
kind
enough
to
give
faith
her
supper
and
put
her
to
bed
faith
s
lip
grieved
cousin
mary
isn
t
mamma
i
want
to
be
kissed
you
haven
t
kissed
her
mother
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
kissed
her
once
twice
put
both
arms
about
her
neck
and
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
without
a
word
mamma
is
tired
dear
i
said
come
she
was
lying
quite
still
when
i
had
done
what
was
to
be
done
for
the
child
and
had
come
back
the
room
was
nearly
dark
i
sat
down
on
my
cricket
by
her
sofa
shall
phœbe
light
the
lamp
not
just
can
t
you
drink
a
cup
of
tea
if
i
bring
it
not
just
did
you
find
the
i
ventured
after
a
pause
i
believe
so
she
drew
a
little
package
from
her
pocket
held
it
a
moment
then
let
it
roll
to
the
floor
forgotten
when
i
picked
it
up
the
soft
wrapper
was
wet
and
hot
with
tears
mary
i
never
thought
of
the
little
trimming
till
the
last
minute
i
had
another
i
waited
i
thought
at
first
i
would
not
tell
you
just
yet
but
i
suppose
the
time
has
come
it
will
be
no
more
easy
to
put
it
off
i
have
been
to
worcester
all
these
times
to
see
a
i
bent
my
head
in
the
dark
and
listened
for
the
rest
he
has
his
reputation
they
said
he
could
help
me
if
anybody
could
he
thought
at
first
he
could
but
mary
see
she
walked
feebly
towards
the
window
where
a
faint
gray
light
struggled
in
and
opened
the
bosom
of
her
dress
there
was
silence
between
us
for
a
long
while
after
that
she
went
back
to
the
sofa
and
i
took
her
hand
and
bowed
my
face
over
it
and
so
we
sat
the
leaves
rustled
out
of
doors
faith
up
stairs
was
singing
herself
to
sleep
with
a
droning
sound
he
talked
of
risking
an
operation
she
said
at
length
but
decided
that
it
was
quite
useless
i
suppose
i
must
give
up
and
be
sick
now
i
am
feeling
the
reaction
from
having
kept
up
so
long
he
thinks
i
shall
not
suffer
a
very
great
deal
he
thinks
he
can
relieve
me
and
that
it
may
be
soon
there
is
no
chance
no
i
took
both
of
her
hands
and
cried
out
i
believe
as
i
did
that
first
night
when
she
spoke
to
me
of
roy
auntie
auntie
auntie
and
tried
to
think
what
i
was
doing
but
only
cried
out
the
more
why
mary
she
said
why
mary
and
again
as
before
she
passed
her
soft
hand
to
and
fro
across
my
hair
till
by
and
by
i
began
to
think
as
i
had
thought
before
that
i
could
bear
anything
which
god
who
loved
us
all
who
loved
us
all
should
send
so
then
after
i
had
grown
still
she
began
to
tell
me
about
it
in
her
quiet
voice
and
the
leaves
rustled
and
faith
had
sung
herself
to
sleep
and
i
listened
wondering
for
there
was
no
pain
in
the
quiet
voice
no
pain
nor
tone
of
fear
indeed
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
detected
through
its
subdued
sadness
a
secret
suppressed
buoyancy
of
satisfaction
with
which
something
struggled
and
you
i
asked
turning
quickly
upon
her
i
should
thank
god
with
all
my
heart
mary
if
it
were
not
for
faith
and
you
but
it
for
faith
and
you
that
s
when
i
had
locked
the
front
door
and
was
creeping
up
here
to
my
room
my
foot
crushed
something
and
a
faint
wounded
perfume
came
up
it
was
the
little
pink
and
purple
chain
xvi
october
the
lord
god
a
mighty
help
us
but
his
ways
are
past
finding
out
what
with
one
thing
and
another
thing
that
child
without
a
mother
and
you
with
the
crape
not
yet
rusty
for
roy
l
it
doos
seem
to
me
as
if
his
manner
of
treating
folks
beats
all
but
i
tell
you
this
miss
mary
my
dear
you
jest
say
your
prayers
reg
lar
and
to
and
he
ll
pull
you
through
sure
this
was
what
phœbe
said
when
i
told
her
november
for
the
first
time
auntie
fairly
gave
up
trying
to
put
faith
to
bed
she
had
insisted
on
it
until
now
crawling
up
by
the
banisters
like
a
wounded
thing
this
time
she
tottered
and
sank
upon
the
second
step
she
cried
out
feebly
i
am
afraid
i
must
give
it
up
to
cousin
mary
faith
the
child
clung
with
both
hands
to
her
faith
faith
mother
s
little
girl
it
was
the
last
dear
care
of
motherhood
yielded
the
last
link
snapped
it
seemed
to
be
the
very
bitterness
of
parting
i
turned
away
that
they
might
bear
it
together
they
two
alone
yet
i
think
that
took
away
the
sting
the
days
are
slipping
away
now
very
quietly
and
to
her
i
am
sure
and
to
me
for
her
sake
very
happily
she
suffers
less
than
i
had
feared
and
she
lies
upon
the
bed
and
smiles
and
faith
comes
in
and
plays
about
and
the
cheery
morning
sunshine
falls
on
everything
and
when
her
strong
hours
come
we
have
long
talks
together
hand
clasped
in
hand
such
pleasant
talks
we
are
quite
brave
to
speak
of
anything
since
we
know
that
what
is
to
be
is
best
just
so
and
since
we
fear
no
parting
i
tell
her
that
faith
and
i
will
soon
learn
to
shut
our
eyes
and
think
we
see
her
and
try
to
make
it
the
same
for
she
will
never
be
very
far
away
will
she
and
then
she
shakes
her
head
smiling
for
it
pleases
her
and
she
kisses
me
softly
then
we
dream
of
how
it
will
all
be
and
how
we
shall
love
and
try
to
please
each
other
quite
as
much
as
now
it
will
be
like
going
around
a
corner
don
t
you
see
she
says
you
will
know
that
i
am
there
all
the
while
though
hidden
and
that
if
you
call
me
i
shall
then
we
talk
of
faith
and
of
how
i
shall
comfort
her
that
i
shall
teach
her
this
and
guard
her
from
that
and
how
i
shall
talk
with
her
about
heaven
and
her
mother
sometimes
faith
comes
up
and
wants
to
know
what
we
are
saying
and
lays
poor
mary
ann
sawdust
and
all
upon
the
pillow
and
wants
her
kissed
so
auntie
kisses
away
the
dolly
s
and
kisses
the
dolly
s
little
mother
sometimes
with
a
quiver
on
her
lips
but
more
often
with
a
smile
in
her
eyes
and
faith
runs
back
to
play
and
her
laugh
ripples
out
and
her
mother
listens
listens
sometimes
too
we
talk
of
some
of
the
people
for
whom
she
cares
of
her
husband
s
friends
of
her
scholars
or
dr
bland
or
clo
or
poor
bin
quirk
or
of
somebody
down
town
whom
she
was
planning
to
help
this
winter
little
clo
comes
in
as
often
as
she
is
strong
enough
to
see
her
and
sends
over
untold
jellies
and
which
faith
and
i
have
to
eat
but
don
t
let
the
child
know
that
auntie
says
but
more
often
we
talk
of
the
life
which
she
is
so
soon
to
begin
of
her
husband
and
roy
of
what
she
will
try
to
say
to
christ
how
much
dearer
he
has
grown
to
her
since
she
has
lain
here
in
pain
at
his
bidding
and
how
he
helps
her
at
morning
and
at
eventide
and
in
the
we
talk
of
the
trees
and
the
mountains
and
the
lilies
in
the
garden
on
which
the
glory
of
the
light
that
is
not
the
light
of
the
sun
may
shine
of
the
little
brooks
by
which
she
longs
to
sit
and
sing
to
faith
of
the
treasures
of
art
which
she
may
fancy
to
have
about
her
of
the
home
in
which
her
husband
may
be
making
ready
for
her
coming
and
wonder
what
he
has
there
and
if
he
knows
how
near
the
time
is
now
but
i
notice
lately
that
she
more
often
and
more
quickly
wearies
of
these
things
that
she
comes
back
and
comes
back
again
to
some
loving
thought
as
loving
as
a
child
s
of
jesus
christ
he
seems
to
be
as
she
once
said
she
tried
that
he
should
be
to
faith
her
sometimes
too
we
wonder
what
it
means
to
pass
out
of
the
body
and
what
one
will
be
first
conscious
of
i
used
to
have
a
very
human
and
by
no
means
slight
dread
of
the
physical
pain
of
death
she
said
but
for
some
reason
or
other
that
is
slowly
leaving
me
i
imagine
that
the
suffering
of
any
fatal
sickness
is
worse
than
the
immediate
process
of
dissolution
then
there
is
so
much
beyond
it
to
occupy
one
s
thoughts
one
thing
i
have
thought
much
about
it
is
that
whatever
may
be
our
first
experience
after
leaving
the
body
it
is
not
likely
to
be
a
one
it
is
more
in
analogy
with
god
s
dealings
that
a
quiet
process
a
gentle
accustoming
should
open
our
eyes
on
the
light
that
would
blind
if
it
came
in
a
flash
perhaps
we
shall
not
see
him
perhaps
we
could
not
bear
it
to
see
him
at
once
it
may
be
that
the
faces
of
familiar
human
friends
will
be
the
first
to
greet
us
it
may
be
that
the
touch
of
the
human
hand
dearer
than
any
but
his
own
shall
lead
us
as
we
are
able
behind
the
veil
till
we
are
a
little
used
to
the
glory
and
the
wonder
and
lead
us
so
to
him
be
that
as
it
may
and
be
heaven
where
it
may
i
am
not
afraid
with
all
my
guessing
and
my
studying
and
my
dreaming
over
these
things
i
am
only
a
child
in
the
dark
nevertheless
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
god
bless
robertson
for
saying
that
i
m
going
to
bless
him
when
i
see
him
how
pleasant
it
will
be
to
see
him
and
some
other
friends
whose
faces
i
never
saw
in
this
world
david
for
instance
or
paul
or
cowper
or
president
lincoln
or
browning
the
only
trouble
is
that
am
nobody
to
them
however
i
fancy
that
they
will
let
me
shake
hands
with
them
no
i
am
quite
willing
to
trust
all
these
things
to
god
and
what
if
much
be
still
unknown
thy
lord
shall
teach
thee
that
when
thou
shalt
stand
before
his
throne
or
sit
as
mary
i
may
find
them
very
different
from
what
i
have
supposed
i
know
that
i
shall
find
them
infinitely
satisfying
than
i
have
supposed
as
schiller
said
of
his
philosophy
perhaps
i
may
be
ashamed
of
my
raw
design
at
sight
of
the
true
original
this
may
happen
i
expect
it
but
then
if
reality
bears
no
resemblance
to
my
dreams
it
will
be
a
more
majestic
a
more
delightful
i
believe
nothing
that
god
denies
i
can
not
overrate
the
beauty
of
his
promise
so
it
surely
can
have
done
no
harm
for
me
to
take
the
comfort
of
my
fancying
till
i
am
there
and
what
a
comfort
it
has
been
to
me
god
only
knows
i
could
scarcely
have
borne
some
things
without
you
are
never
afraid
that
anything
proving
a
little
different
from
what
you
expect
might
might
disappoint
me
no
i
have
settled
that
in
my
heart
with
god
i
do
not
i
shall
be
disappointed
the
truth
is
he
has
obviously
not
the
gates
which
bar
heaven
from
our
sight
but
he
has
as
obviously
not
them
they
stand
ajar
with
the
bible
and
reason
in
the
way
to
keep
them
from
closing
surely
we
should
look
in
as
far
as
we
can
and
surely
if
we
look
with
reverence
our
eyes
will
be
holden
that
we
may
not
cheat
ourselves
with
mirages
and
as
the
little
swedish
girl
said
the
first
time
she
saw
the
stars
o
father
if
the
of
heaven
is
so
beautiful
what
must
the
be
january
i
write
little
now
for
i
am
living
too
much
the
days
are
stealing
away
and
lessening
one
by
one
and
still
faith
plays
about
the
room
though
very
softly
now
and
still
the
cheery
sunshine
shimmers
in
and
still
we
talk
with
clasping
hands
less
often
and
more
pleasantly
morning
and
noon
and
evening
come
and
go
the
snow
drifts
down
and
the
rain
falls
softly
clouds
form
and
break
and
hurry
past
the
windows
shadows
melt
and
lights
are
shattered
and
little
rainbows
are
prisoned
by
the
icicles
that
hang
from
the
eaves
i
sit
and
watch
them
and
watch
the
flicker
in
the
night
and
watch
the
blue
morning
crawl
over
the
hills
and
the
old
words
are
stealing
down
my
thought
is
the
substance
this
the
shadow
that
the
reality
this
the
i
watch
her
face
upon
the
pillow
the
happy
secret
on
its
lips
the
smile
within
its
eyes
it
is
nearly
a
year
now
since
god
sent
the
face
to
me
what
it
has
done
for
me
he
knows
what
the
next
year
and
all
the
years
are
to
be
without
it
he
knows
too
it
is
slipping
away
slipping
and
i
must
lose
it
perhaps
i
should
not
have
said
what
i
said
but
being
weak
from
watching
and
seeing
how
glad
she
was
to
go
seeing
how
all
the
peace
was
for
her
all
the
pain
for
us
i
cried
o
auntie
auntie
why
can
t
we
go
too
why
faith
and
i
go
with
you
but
she
answered
me
only
mary
he
we
will
be
brave
again
a
little
more
sunshine
in
the
room
a
little
more
of
faith
and
the
dolly
the
sabbath
she
asked
for
the
child
at
bedtime
and
i
laid
her
down
in
her
on
her
mother
s
arm
she
kissed
her
and
said
her
prayers
and
talked
a
bit
about
mary
ann
and
and
her
snow
man
i
sat
over
by
the
window
in
the
dusk
and
watched
a
little
creamy
cloud
that
was
folding
in
the
moon
presently
their
voices
grew
low
and
at
last
faith
s
stopped
altogether
then
i
heard
in
fragments
this
sleepy
dear
but
you
won
t
have
many
more
talks
with
mamma
keep
awake
just
a
minute
faith
and
hear
can
you
hear
mamma
will
never
forget
her
little
girl
she
won
t
go
away
very
far
she
will
always
love
you
will
you
remember
as
long
as
you
live
she
will
always
see
you
though
you
can
t
see
her
perhaps
hush
my
darling
cry
isn
t
god
naughty
no
god
is
good
god
is
always
good
he
won
t
take
mamma
a
great
way
off
one
more
kiss
there
now
you
may
go
to
sleep
one
more
come
cousin
june
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
have
written
here
i
did
not
want
to
open
the
book
till
i
was
sure
that
i
could
open
it
quietly
and
could
speak
as
she
would
like
to
have
me
speak
of
what
remains
to
be
written
but
a
very
few
words
will
tell
it
all
it
happened
so
naturally
and
so
happily
she
was
so
glad
when
the
time
came
and
she
made
me
so
glad
for
her
sake
that
i
can
not
grieve
i
say
it
from
my
honest
heart
i
can
not
grieve
in
the
place
out
of
which
she
has
gone
she
has
left
me
peace
i
think
of
something
that
miss
procter
said
about
the
opening
of
that
golden
gate
round
which
the
kneeling
spirits
wait
the
halo
seems
to
linger
round
those
kneeling
closest
to
the
door
the
joy
that
lightened
from
that
place
shines
still
upon
the
watcher
s
i
think
more
often
of
some
things
that
she
herself
said
in
the
very
last
of
those
pleasant
talks
when
turning
a
leaf
in
her
little
bible
she
pointed
out
to
me
the
words
it
is
expedient
for
you
that
i
go
away
for
if
i
go
not
away
the
comforter
will
not
it
was
one
night
the
of
march
she
had
been
in
less
pain
and
had
chatted
and
laughed
more
with
us
than
for
many
a
day
she
begged
that
faith
might
stay
till
dark
and
might
bring
her
noah
s
ark
and
play
down
upon
the
foot
of
the
bed
where
she
could
see
her
i
sat
in
the
with
my
face
to
the
window
we
did
not
light
the
lamps
the
night
came
on
slowly
showery
clouds
flitted
by
but
there
was
a
blaze
of
golden
color
behind
them
it
broke
through
and
scattered
them
it
burned
them
and
melted
them
it
shot
great
pink
and
purple
jets
up
to
the
zenith
it
fell
and
lay
in
amber
mist
upon
the
hills
a
soft
wind
swept
by
and
darted
now
and
then
into
the
glow
and
shifted
it
about
color
away
from
color
and
back
again
see
faith
she
said
softly
put
down
the
little
camel
a
minute
and
look
and
added
after
but
neither
to
the
child
nor
to
me
it
seemed
at
eventide
there
shall
be
phœbe
knocked
presently
and
i
went
out
to
see
what
was
wanted
and
planned
a
little
for
auntie
s
breakfast
and
came
back
faith
with
her
little
ark
was
still
playing
quietly
upon
the
bed
i
sat
down
again
in
my
with
my
face
to
the
window
now
and
then
the
child
s
voice
broke
the
silence
asking
where
should
she
put
the
elephant
and
was
there
room
there
for
the
yellow
bird
and
now
and
then
her
mother
answered
her
and
so
presently
the
skies
had
faded
and
so
the
night
came
on
i
was
thinking
that
it
was
faith
s
bedtime
and
that
i
had
better
light
the
lamp
when
a
few
distinct
hurried
words
from
the
bed
attracted
my
attention
faith
i
think
you
had
better
kiss
mamma
now
and
get
there
was
a
change
in
the
voice
i
was
there
in
a
moment
and
lifted
the
child
from
the
pillow
where
she
had
crept
but
she
said
wait
a
minute
mary
wait
a
minute
for
faith
clung
to
her
with
one
hand
upon
her
cheek
softly
patting
it
i
went
over
and
stood
by
the
window
it
was
her
mother
herself
who
gently
put
the
little
fingers
away
at
last
mother
s
own
little
girl
good
night
my
darling
my
so
i
took
the
child
away
to
phœbe
and
came
back
and
shut
the
door
i
thought
you
might
have
some
message
for
roy
she
said
now
now
i
we
had
often
talked
of
this
and
she
had
promised
to
remember
it
whatever
it
might
be
so
i
told
her
but
i
will
not
write
what
i
told
her
i
saw
that
she
was
playing
weakly
with
her
which
hung
very
loosely
below
its
little
worn
guard
take
the
little
guard
she
said
and
keep
it
for
faith
but
bury
the
other
with
me
he
put
it
on
nobody
else
must
take
it
the
sentence
dropped
unfinished
i
crept
up
on
the
bed
beside
her
for
she
seemed
to
wish
it
i
asked
if
i
should
light
the
lamp
but
she
shook
her
head
the
room
seemed
light
she
said
quite
light
she
wondered
then
if
faith
were
asleep
and
if
she
would
waken
early
in
the
morning
after
that
i
kissed
her
and
then
we
said
nothing
more
only
presently
she
asked
me
to
hold
her
hand
it
was
quite
dark
when
she
turned
her
face
at
last
towards
the
window
john
she
said
why
john
they
came
in
with
heads
uncovered
and
voices
hushed
to
see
her
in
the
days
while
she
was
lying
down
stairs
among
the
flowers
once
when
i
thought
that
she
was
alone
i
went
in
it
was
at
twilight
and
turned
startled
by
a
figure
that
was
crouched
sobbing
on
the
floor
o
i
want
to
go
too
to
go
too
it
cried
she
s
ben
there
all
day
long
said
phœbe
wiping
her
eyes
and
she
won
t
go
home
for
a
mouthful
of
victuals
poor
creetur
but
she
jest
sets
there
and
cries
and
cries
an
there
s
no
stoppin
of
her
it
was
little
clo
at
another
time
i
was
there
with
fresh
flowers
when
the
door
opened
creaking
a
little
and
bin
quirk
came
in
on
tiptoe
trying
in
vain
to
still
the
noise
of
his
new
boots
his
eyes
were
red
and
wet
and
he
held
out
to
me
timidly
a
single
white
carnation
could
you
put
it
somewhere
where
it
wouldn
t
do
any
harm
i
walked
way
over
to
worcester
and
back
to
get
it
if
you
could
jest
hide
it
under
the
others
out
of
sight
seems
to
me
it
would
do
me
a
sight
of
good
to
feel
it
was
there
you
i
motioned
to
him
to
lay
it
himself
between
her
fingers
o
i
darsn
t
i
m
not
fit
m
not
she
d
rether
have
but
i
told
him
that
i
knew
she
would
be
as
pleased
that
he
should
give
it
to
her
himself
as
she
was
when
he
gave
her
the
china
pinks
on
that
distant
summer
day
so
the
great
awkward
fellow
bent
down
as
simply
as
a
child
as
tenderly
as
a
woman
and
left
the
flower
in
its
place
liked
em
he
faltered
maybe
if
what
she
used
to
say
is
all
so
she
ll
like
em
now
she
liked
em
better
than
she
did
machines
i
ve
just
got
my
through
i
was
thinking
how
pleased
she
d
be
i
wanted
to
tell
her
if
i
should
go
to
the
good
place
if
ever
i
do
go
it
will
be
just
her
doin
s
i
ll
tell
her
then
maybe
i
he
forgot
that
anybody
was
there
and
sobbing
hid
his
face
in
his
great
hands
so
we
are
waiting
for
the
morning
when
the
gates
shall
open
faith
and
i
from
my
stiller
watches
am
not
saddened
by
the
music
of
her
life
i
feel
sure
that
her
mother
wishes
it
to
be
a
cheery
life
i
feel
sure
that
she
is
showing
me
who
will
have
no
motherhood
by
which
to
show
myself
how
to
help
her
little
girl
and
roy
ah
well
and
roy
he
knows
our
hour
is
not
yet
come
if
the
master
will
that
we
should
be
about
his
father
s
business
what
is
that
to
us
the
end
