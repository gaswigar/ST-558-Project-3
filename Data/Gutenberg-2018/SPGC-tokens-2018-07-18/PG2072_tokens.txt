by
benson
chapter
i
though
there
was
nothing
visibly
graceful
about
michael
comber
he
apparently
had
the
art
of
giving
gracefully
he
had
already
told
his
cousin
francis
who
sat
on
the
arm
of
the
sofa
by
his
table
that
there
was
no
earthly
excuse
for
his
having
run
into
debt
but
now
when
the
moment
came
for
giving
he
wrote
the
cheque
quickly
and
eagerly
as
if
thoroughly
enjoying
it
and
passed
it
over
to
him
with
a
smile
that
was
extraordinarily
pleasant
there
you
are
then
francis
he
said
and
i
take
it
from
you
that
that
will
put
you
perfectly
square
again
you
ve
got
to
write
to
me
remember
in
two
days
time
saying
that
you
have
paid
those
bills
and
for
the
rest
i
m
delighted
that
you
told
me
about
it
in
fact
i
should
have
been
rather
hurt
if
you
hadn
francis
apparently
had
the
art
of
accepting
gracefully
which
is
more
difficult
than
the
feat
which
michael
had
so
successfully
accomplished
mike
you
re
a
brick
he
said
but
then
you
always
are
a
brick
thanks
michael
got
up
and
shuffled
rather
than
walked
across
the
room
to
the
bell
by
the
fireplace
as
long
as
he
was
sitting
down
his
big
arms
and
broad
shoulders
gave
the
impression
of
strength
and
you
would
have
expected
to
find
when
he
got
up
that
he
was
tall
and
largely
made
but
when
he
rose
the
extreme
shortness
of
his
legs
manifested
itself
and
he
appeared
almost
deformed
his
hands
hung
nearly
to
his
knees
he
was
heavy
short
lumpish
but
it
s
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
francis
he
said
i
have
the
best
of
you
well
it
s
pretty
blessed
to
receive
when
you
are
in
a
tight
place
as
i
was
he
said
laughing
and
i
am
so
yes
i
know
you
are
and
it
s
that
which
makes
me
feel
rather
cheap
because
i
don
t
miss
what
i
ve
given
you
but
that
s
distinctly
not
a
reason
for
your
doing
it
again
you
ll
have
tea
won
t
you
why
yes
said
francis
getting
up
also
and
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
which
was
nearly
on
a
level
with
the
top
of
michael
s
head
and
if
michael
had
gracefulness
only
in
the
art
of
giving
francis
s
gracefulness
in
receiving
was
clearly
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
of
him
he
was
tall
slim
and
alert
with
the
quick
soft
movements
of
some
wild
animal
his
face
brown
with
sunburn
and
pink
with
blood
was
exceedingly
handsome
in
a
boyish
and
almost
effeminate
manner
and
though
he
was
only
eighteen
months
younger
than
his
cousin
he
looked
as
if
nine
or
ten
years
might
have
divided
their
ages
but
you
are
a
brick
mike
he
said
again
laying
his
long
brown
hand
on
his
cousin
s
shoulder
i
can
t
help
saying
it
twice
more
than
was
necessary
said
michael
finally
dismissing
the
subject
the
room
where
they
sat
was
in
michael
s
flat
in
half
moon
street
and
high
up
in
one
of
those
tall
houses
the
windows
were
wide
open
on
this
hot
july
afternoon
and
the
bourdon
hum
of
london
where
piccadilly
poured
by
at
the
street
end
came
in
blended
and
blunted
by
distance
but
with
the
suggestion
of
heat
of
movement
of
hurrying
affairs
the
room
was
very
empty
of
furniture
there
was
a
rug
or
two
on
the
parquet
floor
a
long
low
bookcase
taking
up
the
end
near
the
door
a
table
a
sofa
three
or
four
chairs
and
a
piano
everything
was
plain
but
equally
obviously
everything
was
expensive
and
the
general
impression
given
was
that
the
owner
had
no
desire
to
be
surrounded
by
things
he
did
not
want
but
insisted
on
the
superlative
quality
of
the
things
he
did
the
rugs
for
instance
happened
to
be
of
silk
the
bookcase
happened
to
be
hepplewhite
the
piano
bore
the
most
eminent
of
makers
names
there
were
three
mezzotints
on
the
walls
a
dragon
vase
on
the
high
carved
the
whole
bore
the
unmistakable
stamp
of
a
fine
individual
taste
but
there
s
something
else
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
francis
said
michael
as
presently
afterwards
they
sat
over
their
tea
i
can
t
say
that
i
exactly
want
your
advice
but
i
should
like
your
opinion
i
ve
done
something
in
fact
without
asking
anybody
but
now
that
it
s
done
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
think
about
francis
laughed
that
s
you
all
over
michael
he
said
you
always
do
a
thing
first
if
you
really
mean
to
do
it
which
i
suppose
is
moral
courage
and
then
you
go
anxiously
round
afterwards
to
see
if
other
people
approve
which
i
am
afraid
looks
like
moral
cowardice
i
go
on
a
different
plan
altogether
i
ascertain
the
opinion
of
so
many
people
before
i
do
anything
that
i
end
by
forgetting
what
i
wanted
to
do
at
least
that
seems
a
reasonable
explanation
for
the
fact
that
i
so
seldom
do
michael
looked
affectionately
at
the
handsome
boy
who
lounged
in
the
chair
opposite
him
like
many
very
shy
persons
he
had
one
friend
with
whom
he
was
completely
unreserved
and
that
was
this
cousin
of
his
for
whose
charm
and
insouciant
brilliance
he
had
so
adoring
an
admiration
he
pointed
a
broad
big
finger
at
him
yes
but
when
you
are
like
that
he
said
you
can
just
float
along
other
people
float
you
but
i
should
sink
heavily
if
i
did
nothing
i
ve
got
to
swim
all
the
well
you
are
in
the
army
said
francis
that
s
as
much
swimming
as
anyone
expects
of
a
fellow
who
has
expectations
in
fact
it
s
i
who
have
to
swim
all
the
time
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
you
are
somebody
i
m
not
michael
sat
up
and
took
a
cigarette
but
i
m
not
in
the
army
any
longer
he
said
that
s
just
what
i
am
wanting
to
tell
francis
laughed
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
have
you
been
cashiered
or
shot
or
something
i
mean
that
i
wrote
and
resigned
my
commission
yesterday
said
michael
if
you
had
dined
with
me
last
night
as
by
the
way
you
promised
to
do
i
should
have
told
you
francis
got
up
and
leaned
against
the
he
was
conscious
of
not
thinking
this
abrupt
news
as
important
as
he
felt
he
ought
to
think
it
that
was
characteristic
of
him
he
floated
as
michael
had
lately
told
him
finding
the
world
an
extremely
pleasant
place
full
of
warm
currents
that
took
you
gently
forward
without
entailing
the
slightest
exertion
but
michael
s
grave
and
expectant
face
that
michael
who
had
been
so
eagerly
kind
about
meeting
his
debts
for
him
warned
him
that
however
his
own
emotions
were
he
must
attempt
to
ballast
himself
over
this
are
you
speaking
seriously
he
asked
quite
seriously
i
never
did
anything
that
was
so
and
that
is
what
you
want
my
opinion
about
he
asked
if
so
you
must
tell
me
more
mike
i
can
t
have
an
opinion
unless
you
give
me
the
reasons
why
you
did
it
the
thing
itself
well
the
thing
itself
doesn
t
seem
to
matter
so
immensely
the
significance
of
it
is
why
you
did
michael
s
big
face
lightened
a
moment
for
a
fellow
who
never
thinks
he
said
you
think
uncommonly
well
but
the
reasons
are
obvious
enough
you
can
guess
sufficient
reasons
to
account
for
let
s
hear
them
anyhow
said
francis
michael
clouded
again
surely
they
are
obvious
he
said
no
one
knows
better
than
me
unless
it
is
you
that
i
m
not
like
the
rest
of
you
my
mind
isn
t
the
build
of
a
guardsman
s
mind
any
more
than
my
unfortunate
body
is
half
our
work
as
you
know
quite
well
consists
in
being
pleasant
and
in
liking
it
well
i
m
not
pleasant
i
m
not
breezy
and
cordial
i
can
t
do
it
i
make
a
task
of
what
is
a
pastime
to
all
of
you
and
i
only
shuffle
through
my
task
i
m
not
popular
i
m
not
liked
it
s
no
earthly
use
saying
i
am
i
don
t
like
the
life
it
seems
to
me
senseless
and
those
who
live
it
don
t
like
me
they
think
me
heavy
just
heavy
and
i
have
enough
sensitiveness
to
know
michael
need
not
have
stated
his
reasons
for
his
cousin
could
certainly
have
guessed
them
he
could
too
have
confessed
to
the
truth
of
them
michael
had
not
the
light
hand
which
is
so
necessary
when
young
men
work
together
in
a
companionship
of
which
the
cordiality
is
an
essential
part
of
the
work
neither
had
he
in
the
social
side
of
life
that
particular
and
inimitable
sort
of
easy
which
as
he
had
said
just
now
enables
its
owner
to
float
except
in
years
he
was
not
young
he
could
not
manage
to
be
clubable
he
was
serious
and
awkward
at
a
supper
party
he
was
altogether
without
the
effervescence
which
is
necessary
in
order
to
avoid
flatness
he
did
his
work
also
in
the
same
conscientious
but
leaden
way
officers
and
men
alike
felt
it
all
this
francis
knew
perfectly
well
but
instead
of
acknowledging
it
he
tried
quite
fruitlessly
to
smooth
it
over
aren
t
you
exaggerating
he
asked
michael
shook
his
head
oh
don
t
tone
it
down
francis
he
said
even
if
i
was
exaggerating
which
i
don
t
for
a
moment
admit
the
effect
on
my
general
efficiency
would
be
the
same
i
think
what
i
say
is
francis
became
more
practical
but
you
ve
only
been
in
the
regiment
three
years
he
said
it
won
t
be
very
popular
resigning
after
only
three
i
have
nothing
much
to
lose
on
the
score
of
popularity
remarked
michael
there
was
nothing
pertinent
that
could
be
consoling
here
and
have
you
told
your
father
asked
francis
does
uncle
robert
know
yes
i
wrote
to
father
this
morning
and
i
m
going
down
to
ashbridge
i
shall
be
very
sorry
if
he
then
you
ll
be
sorry
said
francis
i
know
but
it
won
t
make
any
difference
to
my
action
after
all
i
m
if
i
can
t
begin
to
manage
my
life
now
you
may
be
sure
i
never
shall
but
i
know
i
m
right
i
would
bet
on
my
infallibility
at
present
i
ve
only
told
you
half
my
reasons
for
resigning
and
already
you
agree
with
francis
did
not
contradict
this
let
s
hear
the
rest
then
he
said
you
shall
the
rest
is
far
more
important
and
rather
resembles
a
francis
appropriately
sat
down
again
well
it
s
this
said
michael
i
m
and
it
is
time
that
i
began
trying
to
be
what
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
be
instead
of
not
trying
very
much
because
it
s
hopeless
to
be
what
i
can
t
be
i
m
going
to
study
music
i
believe
that
i
could
perhaps
do
something
there
and
in
any
case
i
love
it
more
than
anything
else
and
if
you
love
a
thing
you
have
certainly
a
better
chance
of
succeeding
in
it
than
in
something
that
you
don
t
love
at
all
i
was
stuck
into
the
army
for
no
reason
except
that
soldiering
is
among
the
few
employments
which
it
is
considered
proper
for
fellows
in
my
position
good
lord
how
awful
it
sounds
proper
for
me
to
adopt
the
other
things
that
were
open
were
that
i
should
be
a
sailor
or
a
member
of
parliament
but
the
soldier
was
what
father
chose
i
looked
round
the
picture
gallery
at
home
the
other
day
there
are
twelve
lord
ashbridges
in
uniform
so
as
i
shall
be
lord
ashbridge
when
father
dies
i
was
stuck
into
uniform
too
to
be
the
thirteenth
but
what
has
it
all
come
to
if
you
think
of
it
when
did
the
majority
of
them
wear
their
smart
uniforms
chiefly
when
they
went
on
peaceful
parades
or
to
court
balls
or
to
the
sir
joshua
reynolds
of
the
period
to
be
painted
they
ve
been
tin
soldiers
francis
you
re
a
tin
soldier
and
i
ve
just
ceased
to
be
a
tin
soldier
if
there
was
the
smallest
chance
of
being
useful
in
the
army
by
which
i
mean
standing
up
and
being
shot
at
because
i
am
english
i
would
not
dream
of
throwing
it
up
but
there
s
no
such
michael
paused
a
moment
in
his
sermon
and
beat
out
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
against
the
grate
anyhow
the
chance
is
too
remote
he
said
all
the
nations
with
armies
and
navies
are
too
much
afraid
of
each
other
to
do
more
than
growl
also
i
happen
to
want
to
do
something
different
with
my
life
and
you
can
t
do
anything
unless
you
believe
in
what
you
are
doing
i
want
to
leave
behind
me
something
more
than
the
portrait
of
a
tin
soldier
in
the
at
ashbridge
after
all
isn
t
an
artistic
profession
the
greatest
there
is
for
what
counts
what
is
of
value
in
the
world
greek
statues
the
italian
pictures
the
symphonies
of
beethoven
the
plays
of
shakespeare
the
people
who
have
made
beautiful
things
are
they
who
are
the
benefactors
of
mankind
at
least
so
the
people
who
love
beautiful
things
francis
glanced
at
his
cousin
he
knew
this
interesting
vital
side
of
michael
he
was
aware
too
that
had
anybody
except
himself
been
in
the
room
michael
could
not
have
shown
it
perhaps
there
might
be
people
to
whom
he
could
show
it
but
certainly
they
were
not
those
among
whom
michael
s
life
was
passed
go
on
he
said
encouragingly
you
re
ripping
well
the
nuisance
of
it
is
that
the
things
i
am
ripping
about
appear
to
father
to
be
a
sort
of
indoor
game
it
s
all
right
to
play
the
piano
if
it
s
too
wet
to
play
golf
you
can
amuse
yourself
with
painting
if
there
aren
t
any
pheasants
to
shoot
in
fact
he
will
think
that
my
wanting
to
become
a
musician
is
much
the
same
thing
as
if
i
wanted
to
become
a
and
if
he
and
i
talked
about
it
till
we
were
a
hundred
years
old
he
could
never
possibly
appreciate
my
point
of
michael
got
up
and
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
with
his
slow
ponderous
movement
francis
it
s
a
thousand
pities
that
you
and
i
can
t
change
places
he
said
you
are
exactly
the
son
father
would
like
to
have
and
i
should
so
much
prefer
being
his
nephew
however
you
come
next
that
s
one
he
paused
a
moment
you
see
the
fact
is
that
he
doesn
t
like
me
he
said
he
has
no
sympathy
whatever
with
my
tastes
nor
with
what
i
am
i
m
an
awful
trial
to
him
and
i
don
t
see
how
to
help
it
it
s
pure
waste
of
time
my
going
on
in
the
guards
i
do
it
badly
and
i
hate
it
now
you
re
made
for
it
you
re
that
sort
and
that
sort
is
my
father
s
sort
but
i
m
not
no
one
knows
that
better
than
myself
then
there
s
the
question
of
marriage
michael
gave
a
mirthless
laugh
i
m
you
see
he
said
and
it
s
the
family
custom
for
the
eldest
son
to
marry
at
just
as
he
s
baptised
when
he
s
a
certain
number
of
weeks
old
and
confirmed
when
he
is
fifteen
it
s
part
of
the
family
plan
and
the
medes
and
persians
aren
t
in
it
when
the
family
plan
is
in
question
then
again
the
lucky
young
woman
has
to
be
suitable
that
is
to
say
she
must
be
what
my
father
calls
one
of
how
i
loathe
that
phrase
so
my
mother
has
a
list
of
the
suitable
and
they
come
down
to
ashbridge
in
gloomy
succession
and
she
and
i
are
sent
out
to
play
golf
together
or
go
on
the
river
and
when
to
our
unutterable
relief
that
is
over
we
hurry
back
to
the
house
and
i
escape
to
my
piano
and
she
goes
and
flirts
with
you
if
you
are
there
don
t
deny
it
and
then
another
one
comes
and
she
is
drearier
than
the
last
at
least
i
francis
lay
back
and
laughed
at
this
dismal
picture
of
the
rejection
of
the
fittest
but
you
re
so
confoundedly
hard
to
please
mike
he
said
there
was
an
awfully
nice
girl
down
at
ashbridge
at
easter
when
i
was
there
who
was
simply
pining
to
take
you
i
ve
forgotten
her
michael
clicked
his
fingers
in
a
summary
manner
there
you
are
he
said
you
and
she
flirted
all
the
time
and
three
months
afterwards
you
don
t
even
remember
her
name
if
you
had
only
been
me
you
would
have
married
her
as
it
was
she
and
i
bored
each
other
stiff
there
s
an
irony
for
you
but
as
for
pining
i
ask
you
whether
any
girl
in
her
senses
could
pine
for
me
look
at
me
and
tell
me
or
rather
don
t
look
at
me
i
can
t
bear
to
be
looked
here
was
one
of
michael
s
morbid
sensitivenesses
he
seldom
forgot
his
own
physical
appearance
the
fact
of
which
was
to
him
appalling
his
stumpy
figure
with
its
big
body
his
broad
face
his
long
arms
his
large
hands
and
feet
his
clumsiness
in
movement
were
to
him
of
the
nature
of
a
constant
nightmare
and
it
was
only
with
francis
and
the
ease
that
his
solitary
presence
gave
or
when
he
was
occupied
with
music
that
he
wholly
lost
his
in
this
respect
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
must
be
as
repulsive
to
others
as
he
was
to
himself
which
was
a
distorted
view
of
the
case
plain
without
doubt
he
was
and
of
heavy
and
ungainly
build
but
his
belief
in
the
finality
of
his
uncouthness
was
morbid
and
imaginary
and
half
his
inability
to
get
on
with
his
fellows
no
less
than
with
the
maidens
who
were
brought
down
in
single
file
to
ashbridge
was
due
to
this
he
knew
very
well
how
they
escaped
to
the
geniality
and
attractiveness
of
francis
and
in
the
clutch
of
his
own
introspective
temperament
he
could
not
free
himself
from
the
handicap
of
his
own
sensitiveness
and
like
others
take
himself
for
granted
he
crushed
his
own
power
to
please
by
the
weight
of
his
judgments
on
himself
so
there
s
another
reason
to
complain
of
the
irony
of
fate
he
said
i
don
t
want
to
marry
anybody
and
god
knows
nobody
wants
to
marry
me
but
then
it
s
my
duty
to
become
the
father
of
another
lord
ashbridge
as
if
there
had
not
been
enough
of
them
already
and
his
mother
must
be
a
certain
kind
of
girl
with
whom
i
have
nothing
in
common
so
i
say
that
if
only
we
could
have
changed
places
you
would
have
filled
my
niche
so
perfectly
and
i
should
have
been
free
to
bury
myself
in
leipzig
or
munich
and
lived
like
the
grub
i
certainly
am
and
have
drowned
myself
in
a
sea
of
music
as
it
is
goodness
knows
what
my
father
will
say
to
the
letter
i
wrote
him
yesterday
which
he
will
have
received
this
morning
however
that
will
soon
be
patent
for
i
go
down
there
i
wish
you
were
coming
with
me
can
t
you
manage
to
for
a
day
or
two
and
help
things
along
aunt
barbara
will
be
francis
consulted
a
small
green
morocco
can
t
he
said
nor
yet
the
day
after
but
perhaps
i
could
get
a
few
days
leave
next
next
week
s
no
use
i
go
to
baireuth
next
baireuth
who
s
baireuth
asked
francis
oh
a
man
i
know
his
other
name
was
wagner
and
he
wrote
some
francis
nodded
oh
but
i
ve
heard
of
him
he
said
they
re
rather
long
tunes
aren
t
they
at
least
i
found
them
so
when
i
went
to
the
opera
the
other
night
go
on
with
your
plans
mike
what
do
you
mean
to
do
after
that
go
on
to
munich
and
hear
the
same
tunes
over
again
after
that
i
shall
come
back
and
settle
down
in
town
and
play
the
piano
asked
francis
amiably
trying
to
enter
into
his
cousin
s
schemes
michael
laughed
no
doubt
that
will
come
into
it
he
said
but
it
s
rather
as
if
you
told
somebody
you
were
a
soldier
and
he
said
oh
is
that
quick
march
so
it
is
soldiering
largely
consists
of
quick
march
especially
when
it
s
more
than
usually
well
i
shall
learn
to
play
the
piano
said
michael
but
you
play
so
rippingly
already
said
francis
cordially
you
played
all
those
songs
the
other
night
which
you
had
never
seen
before
if
you
can
do
that
there
is
nothing
more
you
want
to
learn
with
the
piano
is
there
you
are
talking
rather
as
father
will
talk
observed
michael
am
i
well
i
seem
to
be
talking
you
weren
t
doing
what
you
seemed
then
i
ve
got
absolutely
everything
to
learn
about
the
francis
rose
then
it
is
clear
i
don
t
understand
anything
about
it
he
said
nor
i
suppose
does
uncle
robert
but
really
i
rather
envy
you
mike
anyhow
you
want
to
do
and
be
something
so
much
that
you
are
gaily
going
to
face
unpleasantnesses
with
uncle
robert
about
it
now
i
wouldn
t
face
unpleasantnesses
with
anybody
about
anything
i
wanted
to
do
and
i
suppose
the
reason
must
be
that
i
don
t
want
to
do
anything
the
malady
of
not
wanting
quoted
michael
yes
i
ve
got
that
malady
the
ordinary
things
that
one
naturally
does
are
all
so
pleasant
and
take
all
the
time
there
is
that
i
don
t
want
anything
particular
especially
now
that
you
ve
been
such
a
brick
stop
it
said
michael
right
i
got
it
in
rather
cleverly
i
was
saying
that
it
must
be
rather
nice
to
want
a
thing
so
much
that
you
ll
go
through
a
lot
to
get
it
most
fellows
aren
t
like
a
good
many
fellows
are
observed
michael
i
suppose
so
i
m
one
you
know
i
drift
and
float
but
i
don
t
think
i
sting
what
are
you
doing
by
the
way
playing
the
piano
i
hope
why
only
that
two
fellows
are
dining
with
me
and
i
thought
perhaps
you
would
come
aunt
barbara
sent
me
the
ticket
for
a
box
at
the
gaiety
too
and
we
might
look
in
there
then
there
s
a
dance
thanks
very
much
but
i
think
i
won
t
said
michael
i
m
rather
looking
forward
to
an
evening
and
that
s
an
odd
thing
to
look
forward
to
remarked
francis
not
when
you
want
to
play
the
piano
i
shall
have
a
chop
here
at
eight
and
probably
thump
away
till
francis
looked
round
for
his
hat
and
stick
i
must
go
he
said
i
ought
to
have
gone
long
ago
but
i
didn
t
want
to
the
malady
came
in
again
most
of
the
world
have
got
it
you
know
michael
rose
and
stood
by
his
tall
cousin
i
think
we
english
have
got
it
he
said
at
least
the
english
you
and
i
know
have
got
it
but
i
don
t
believe
the
germans
for
instance
have
they
re
in
deadly
earnest
about
all
sorts
of
things
music
among
them
which
is
the
point
that
concerns
me
the
music
of
the
world
is
german
you
know
francis
demurred
to
this
oh
i
don
t
think
so
he
said
this
thing
at
the
gaiety
is
ripping
i
believe
do
come
and
michael
resisted
this
chance
of
revising
his
opinion
about
the
german
origin
of
music
and
francis
drifted
out
into
piccadilly
it
was
already
getting
on
for
seven
o
clock
and
the
roadway
and
pavements
were
full
of
people
who
seemed
rather
to
contradict
michael
s
theory
that
the
nation
generally
suffered
from
the
malady
of
not
wanting
so
eagerly
and
numerously
were
they
on
the
quest
for
amusement
already
the
street
was
a
mass
of
taxicabs
and
private
motors
containing
each
one
of
them
men
and
women
in
evening
dress
hurrying
out
to
dine
before
the
theatre
or
the
opera
bright
eager
faces
peered
out
with
sheen
of
silk
and
glitter
of
gems
they
all
seemed
alert
and
prosperous
and
keen
for
the
daily
hours
of
evening
entertainment
a
crowd
similar
in
spirit
pervaded
the
pavements
men
with
coat
on
arm
stepped
in
and
out
of
swinging
club
doors
and
the
example
set
by
the
leisured
class
seemed
copiously
copied
by
those
whom
desks
and
shops
had
made
prisoners
all
day
the
air
of
the
whole
town
swarming
with
the
nation
that
is
supposed
to
make
so
grave
an
affair
of
its
amusements
was
indescribably
gay
and
lighthearted
the
whole
city
seemed
set
on
enjoying
itself
the
buses
that
boomed
along
were
packed
inside
and
out
and
each
was
placarded
with
advertisement
of
some
popular
piece
at
theatre
or
inside
the
green
park
the
grass
was
populous
with
lounging
figures
who
unable
to
pay
for
indoor
entertainment
were
making
the
most
of
what
the
coolness
of
sunset
and
grass
supplied
them
with
gratis
the
newsboards
of
itinerant
sellers
contained
nothing
of
more
serious
import
than
the
result
of
cricket
matches
and
as
the
dusk
began
to
fall
street
lamps
and
signs
were
lit
like
early
rising
stars
so
that
no
hint
of
the
gathering
night
should
be
permitted
to
intrude
on
the
perpetually
illuminated
city
all
that
was
sordid
and
sad
all
that
was
busy
except
on
these
gay
errands
of
pleasure
was
shuffled
away
out
of
sight
so
that
the
pleasure
seekers
might
be
excused
for
believing
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
that
could
demand
their
attention
except
the
need
of
amusing
themselves
successfully
the
workers
toiled
in
order
that
when
the
working
day
was
over
the
fruits
of
their
labour
might
yield
a
harvest
of
a
few
hours
enjoyment
silkworms
had
spun
so
that
from
carriage
windows
might
glimmer
the
wrappings
made
from
their
cocoons
divers
had
been
imperilled
in
deep
seas
so
that
the
pearls
they
had
won
might
embellish
the
necks
of
these
fair
wearers
to
francis
this
all
seemed
very
natural
and
proper
part
of
the
recognised
order
of
things
that
made
up
the
series
of
sensations
known
to
him
as
life
he
did
not
as
he
had
said
very
particularly
care
about
anything
and
it
was
undoubtedly
true
that
there
was
no
motive
or
conscious
purpose
in
his
life
for
which
he
would
voluntarily
have
undergone
any
important
stress
of
discomfort
or
annoyance
it
was
true
that
in
pursuance
of
his
profession
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
quick
marching
and
drill
to
be
done
in
the
heat
but
that
was
incidental
to
the
fact
that
he
was
in
the
guards
and
more
than
compensated
for
by
the
pleasures
that
were
also
naturally
incidental
to
it
he
would
have
been
quite
unable
to
think
of
anything
that
he
would
sooner
do
than
what
he
did
and
he
had
sufficient
of
the
ingrained
human
tendency
to
do
something
of
the
sort
which
was
a
matter
of
routine
rather
than
effort
than
have
nothing
whatever
except
the
gratification
of
momentary
whims
to
fill
his
day
besides
it
was
one
of
the
conventions
or
even
conditions
of
life
that
every
boy
on
leaving
school
did
something
for
a
certain
number
of
years
some
went
into
business
in
order
to
acquire
the
wealth
that
should
procure
them
leisure
some
like
himself
became
soldiers
or
sailors
not
because
they
liked
guns
and
ships
but
because
to
boys
of
a
certain
class
these
professions
supplied
honourable
employment
and
a
pleasant
time
without
being
in
any
way
slack
in
his
regimental
duties
he
performed
them
as
many
others
did
without
the
smallest
grain
of
passion
and
without
any
imaginative
forecast
as
to
what
fruit
if
any
there
might
be
to
these
hours
spent
in
drill
and
discipline
he
was
but
one
of
a
very
large
number
who
do
their
work
without
seriously
bothering
their
heads
about
its
possible
meaning
or
application
his
particular
job
gave
a
young
man
a
pleasant
position
and
an
easy
path
to
general
popularity
given
that
he
was
willing
to
be
sociable
and
amused
he
was
extremely
ready
to
be
both
the
one
and
the
other
and
there
his
philosophy
of
life
stopped
and
indeed
it
seemed
on
this
hot
july
evening
that
the
streets
were
populated
by
philosophers
like
unto
himself
never
had
england
generally
been
more
prosperous
more
secure
more
comfortable
the
heavens
of
international
politics
were
as
serene
as
the
evening
sky
not
yet
was
the
that
hung
over
ireland
bigger
than
a
man
s
hand
east
west
north
and
south
there
brooded
the
peace
of
the
close
of
a
halcyon
day
and
the
amazing
doings
of
the
suffragettes
but
added
a
slight
incentive
to
the
perusal
of
the
morning
paper
the
arts
flourished
harvests
prospered
the
world
like
a
clock
seemed
to
be
in
for
a
spell
of
serene
and
orderly
ticking
with
an
occasional
chime
just
to
show
how
the
hours
were
passing
london
was
an
extraordinarily
pleasant
place
people
were
friendly
amusements
beckoned
on
all
sides
and
for
francis
as
for
so
many
others
but
a
very
moderate
amount
of
work
was
necessary
to
win
him
an
approved
place
in
the
scheme
of
things
a
seat
in
the
sunshine
it
really
was
not
necessary
to
want
above
all
to
undergo
annoyances
for
the
sake
of
what
you
wanted
since
so
many
pleasurable
distractions
enough
to
fill
day
and
night
twice
over
were
so
richly
spread
around
some
day
he
supposed
he
would
marry
settle
down
and
become
in
time
one
of
those
men
who
presented
a
bald
head
in
a
club
window
to
the
gaze
of
it
was
difficult
perhaps
to
see
how
you
could
enjoy
yourself
or
lead
a
life
that
paid
its
own
way
in
pleasure
at
the
age
of
forty
but
that
he
trusted
that
he
would
learn
in
time
at
present
it
was
sufficient
to
know
that
in
half
an
hour
two
excellent
friends
would
come
to
dinner
and
that
they
would
proceed
in
a
spirit
of
amiable
content
to
the
gaiety
after
that
there
was
a
ball
somewhere
he
had
forgotten
where
but
one
of
the
others
would
be
sure
to
know
and
and
would
be
like
unto
it
was
idle
to
ask
questions
of
oneself
when
all
went
so
well
the
time
for
asking
questions
was
when
there
was
matter
for
complaint
and
with
him
assuredly
there
was
none
the
advantages
of
being
years
old
gay
and
without
a
care
in
the
world
now
that
he
had
michael
s
cheque
in
his
pocket
needed
no
comment
still
less
complaint
he
like
the
crowd
who
had
sufficient
to
pay
for
a
seat
at
a
was
perfectly
content
with
life
in
general
would
be
time
enough
to
do
a
little
more
work
and
glean
a
little
more
pleasure
it
was
indeed
an
admirable
england
where
it
was
not
necessary
even
to
desire
for
there
were
so
many
things
bright
cheerful
things
to
distract
the
mind
from
desire
it
was
a
day
of
dozing
in
the
sun
like
the
submerged
scattered
units
or
duets
on
the
grass
of
the
green
park
of
behaving
like
the
lilies
of
the
field
francis
found
he
was
rather
late
and
proceeded
hastily
to
his
mother
s
house
in
savile
row
to
array
himself
if
not
like
one
of
these
like
an
exceedingly
young
man
who
demanded
of
his
tailor
the
utmost
of
his
art
with
the
prospect
owing
to
michael
s
generosity
of
being
paid
michael
when
his
cousin
had
left
him
did
not
at
once
proceed
to
his
evening
by
himself
with
his
piano
though
an
hour
before
he
had
longed
to
be
alone
with
it
and
a
pianoforte
arrangement
of
the
meistersingers
of
which
he
had
promised
himself
a
complete
perusal
that
evening
but
francis
s
visit
had
already
distracted
him
and
he
found
now
that
francis
s
departure
took
him
even
farther
away
from
his
designed
evening
francis
with
his
good
looks
and
his
gay
spirits
his
easy
friendships
and
perfect
content
except
when
a
small
matter
of
deficit
and
dunning
letters
obscured
the
sunlight
for
a
moment
was
exactly
all
that
he
would
have
wished
to
be
himself
but
the
moment
he
formulated
that
wish
in
his
mind
he
knew
that
he
would
not
voluntarily
have
parted
with
one
atom
of
his
own
individuality
in
order
to
be
francis
or
anybody
else
he
was
aware
how
easy
and
pleasant
life
would
become
if
he
could
look
on
it
with
francis
s
eyes
and
if
the
world
would
look
on
him
as
it
looked
on
his
cousin
there
would
be
no
more
bother
in
a
moment
he
would
by
this
exchange
have
parted
with
his
own
unhappy
temperament
his
own
deplorable
body
and
have
stepped
into
an
amiable
and
prosperous
little
neutral
kingdom
that
had
no
desires
and
no
regrets
he
would
have
been
free
from
all
wants
except
such
as
could
be
gratified
so
easily
by
a
little
work
and
a
great
capacity
for
being
amused
he
would
have
found
himself
excellently
fitting
the
niche
into
which
the
rulers
of
birth
and
death
had
placed
him
an
eldest
son
of
a
great
territorial
magnate
who
had
what
was
called
a
stake
in
the
country
and
desired
nothing
better
willingly
as
he
had
said
would
he
have
changed
circumstances
with
francis
but
he
knew
that
he
would
not
for
any
bait
the
world
could
draw
in
front
of
him
have
changed
natures
with
him
even
when
to
all
appearance
the
gain
would
so
vastly
have
been
on
his
side
it
was
better
to
want
and
to
miss
than
to
be
content
even
at
this
moment
when
francis
had
taken
the
sunshine
out
of
the
room
with
his
departure
michael
clung
to
his
own
gloom
and
his
own
uncouthness
if
by
getting
rid
of
them
he
would
also
have
been
obliged
to
get
rid
of
his
own
temperament
unhappy
as
it
was
but
yet
capable
of
strong
desire
he
did
not
want
to
be
content
he
wanted
to
see
always
ahead
of
him
a
golden
mist
through
which
the
shadows
of
unconjecturable
shapes
appeared
he
was
willing
and
eager
to
get
lost
if
only
he
might
go
wandering
on
groping
with
his
big
hands
stumbling
with
his
clumsy
feet
desiring
there
are
the
indications
of
a
path
visible
to
all
who
desire
michael
knew
that
his
path
the
way
that
seemed
to
lead
in
the
direction
of
the
ultimate
goal
was
music
there
somehow
in
that
direction
lay
his
destiny
that
was
the
route
he
was
not
like
the
majority
of
his
sex
and
years
who
weave
their
physical
and
mental
dreams
in
the
loom
of
a
girl
s
face
in
her
glance
in
the
curves
of
her
mouth
deliberately
owing
chiefly
to
his
morbid
consciousness
of
his
own
physical
defects
he
had
long
been
accustomed
to
check
the
instincts
natural
to
a
young
man
in
this
regard
he
had
seen
too
often
the
facility
with
which
others
more
fortunate
than
he
get
delightedly
lost
in
that
golden
haze
he
had
experienced
too
often
the
absence
of
attractiveness
in
himself
how
could
any
girl
of
the
london
ballroom
he
had
so
frequently
asked
himself
tolerate
dancing
or
sitting
out
with
him
when
there
was
francis
and
a
hundred
others
like
him
so
pleased
to
take
his
place
nor
so
he
told
himself
was
his
mind
one
whit
more
apt
than
his
body
it
did
not
move
lightly
and
agreeably
with
unconscious
smiles
and
easy
laughter
by
nature
he
was
monkish
he
was
celibate
he
could
but
cease
to
burn
incense
at
such
ineffectual
altars
and
help
as
he
had
helped
this
afternoon
to
replenish
the
censers
of
more
fortunate
acolytes
this
was
all
familiar
to
him
it
passed
through
his
head
unbidden
when
francis
had
left
him
like
the
refrain
of
some
song
occurring
spontaneously
without
need
of
an
effort
of
memory
it
was
a
possession
of
his
known
by
heart
and
it
no
longer
except
for
momentary
twinges
had
any
bitterness
for
him
this
afternoon
it
is
true
there
had
been
one
such
when
francis
gleeful
with
his
cheque
had
gone
out
to
his
dinner
and
his
theatre
and
his
dance
inviting
him
cheerfully
to
all
of
them
in
just
that
had
been
the
bitterness
namely
that
francis
had
so
overflowing
a
of
content
that
he
could
be
cordial
in
bidding
him
cast
a
certain
gloom
over
these
entertainments
michael
knew
quite
unerringly
that
francis
and
his
friends
would
not
enjoy
themselves
quite
so
much
if
he
was
with
them
there
would
be
the
restraint
of
polite
conversation
at
dinner
instead
of
completely
idle
babble
there
would
be
less
outspoken
normality
at
the
gaiety
a
little
more
decorum
about
the
whole
of
the
boyish
proceedings
he
knew
all
that
so
well
so
terribly
well
his
servant
had
come
in
with
the
evening
paper
and
the
implied
suggestion
of
the
propriety
of
going
to
dress
before
he
roused
himself
he
decided
not
to
dress
as
he
was
going
to
spend
the
evening
alone
and
instead
he
seated
himself
at
the
piano
with
his
copy
of
the
meistersingers
and
mechanically
at
first
with
the
ragged
of
his
reverie
hanging
about
his
brain
banged
away
at
the
overture
he
had
extraordinary
dexterity
of
finger
for
one
who
had
had
so
little
training
and
his
hands
with
their
great
stretch
made
light
work
of
octaves
and
even
tenths
his
knowledge
of
the
music
enabled
him
to
wake
the
singing
bird
of
memory
in
his
head
and
before
long
flute
and
horn
and
string
and
woodwind
began
to
make
themselves
heard
in
his
inner
ear
twice
his
servant
came
in
to
tell
him
that
his
dinner
was
ready
but
michael
had
no
heed
for
anything
but
the
sounds
which
his
flying
fingers
suggested
to
him
francis
his
father
his
own
failure
in
the
life
that
had
been
thrust
on
him
were
all
gone
he
was
with
the
singers
of
nuremberg
chapter
ii
the
river
ashe
after
a
drowsy
and
meandering
childhood
passed
peacefully
among
the
sedges
and
marigolds
of
its
water
meadows
suddenly
and
somewhat
disconcertingly
grows
up
and
without
any
period
of
transition
and
adolescence
becomes
from
being
a
mere
girl
of
a
rivulet
a
male
and
estuary
of
the
sea
at
coton
for
instance
the
tips
of
the
sculls
of
a
sauntering
will
almost
span
its
entire
width
while
but
a
mile
farther
down
you
will
see
barges
and
tall
sailing
craft
coming
up
with
the
tide
and
making
fast
to
the
grey
wooden
quay
wall
of
ashbridge
rough
with
barnacles
for
the
reeds
and
of
its
margin
are
exchanged
the
brown
and
green
growths
of
the
sea
with
their
sharp
acrid
odour
instead
of
the
damp
fresh
smell
of
meadow
flowers
and
at
low
tide
the
podded
bladders
of
brown
weed
and
long
strings
of
marine
macaroni
among
which
peevish
crabs
scuttle
sideways
take
the
place
of
the
grass
and
spires
of
loosestrife
and
over
the
water
instead
of
singing
larks
hang
white
companies
of
chiding
seagulls
here
at
high
tide
extends
a
sheet
of
water
large
enough
when
the
wind
blows
up
the
estuary
to
breed
waves
that
break
in
foam
and
spray
against
the
barges
while
at
the
ebb
acres
of
mud
flats
are
disclosed
on
which
the
boats
lean
slanting
till
the
flood
lifts
them
again
and
makes
them
strain
at
the
wheezing
ropes
that
tie
them
to
the
quay
a
year
before
the
flame
of
war
went
roaring
through
europe
in
unquenchable
conflagration
it
would
have
seemed
that
nothing
could
possibly
rouse
ashbridge
from
its
georgian
repose
there
was
never
a
town
so
inimitably
drowsy
or
so
sternly
uncompetitive
a
hundred
years
ago
it
must
have
presented
almost
precisely
the
same
appearance
as
it
did
in
the
summer
of
if
we
leave
out
of
reckoning
a
few
dozen
of
modern
upstart
villas
that
line
its
outskirts
and
the
very
inconspicuous
railway
station
that
hides
itself
behind
the
warehouses
near
the
river
s
bank
most
of
the
trains
too
quite
ignore
its
existence
and
pass
through
it
on
their
way
to
more
rewarding
hardly
recognising
it
even
by
a
spurt
of
steam
from
their
whistles
and
it
is
only
if
you
travel
by
those
that
require
the
most
frequent
pauses
in
their
progress
that
you
will
be
enabled
to
alight
at
its
thin
and
depopulated
platform
just
outside
the
station
there
perennially
waits
a
and
sanguine
omnibus
that
under
daily
discouragement
continues
to
hope
that
in
the
fulness
of
time
somebody
will
want
to
be
driven
somewhere
this
nobody
ever
does
since
the
distance
to
any
house
is
so
small
and
a
porter
follows
with
luggage
on
a
barrow
it
carries
on
its
floor
a
quantity
of
fresh
straw
in
the
manner
of
the
stage
coaches
in
which
the
problematic
passenger
should
he
ever
appear
will
no
doubt
bury
his
feet
on
its
side
just
below
the
window
that
is
not
made
to
open
it
carries
the
legend
that
shows
that
it
belongs
to
the
comber
arms
a
hostelry
so
that
it
is
discoverable
only
by
the
of
pilgrims
narrow
roadways
flanked
by
proportionately
narrower
pavements
lie
between
huddled
shops
and
georgian
houses
and
an
air
of
leisure
and
content
amounting
almost
to
stupefaction
is
the
moral
atmosphere
of
the
place
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
crowning
the
gentle
hills
that
lie
to
the
north
and
west
villas
in
acre
plots
belonging
to
business
men
in
the
county
town
some
ten
miles
distant
prick
their
cockney
ears
and
are
strangely
at
variance
with
the
sober
gravity
of
the
indigenous
houses
so
too
are
the
manners
and
customs
of
their
owners
who
go
to
stoneborough
every
morning
to
their
work
and
return
by
the
train
that
brings
them
home
in
time
for
dinner
they
do
other
exotic
and
unsuitable
things
also
like
driving
swiftly
about
in
motors
in
playing
golf
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
at
coton
and
in
having
parties
at
each
other
s
houses
but
apart
from
them
nobody
ever
seems
to
leave
ashbridge
though
a
stroll
to
the
station
about
the
time
that
the
evening
train
arrives
is
a
recognised
diversion
or
in
consequence
ever
to
come
back
ashbridge
in
fact
is
and
desires
neither
to
meddle
with
others
nor
to
be
meddled
with
the
estuary
opposite
the
town
is
some
quarter
of
a
mile
broad
at
high
tide
and
in
order
to
cross
to
the
other
side
where
lie
the
woods
and
park
of
ashbridge
house
it
is
necessary
to
shout
and
make
staccato
prancings
in
order
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
antique
ferryman
who
is
invariably
at
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
generally
asleep
at
the
bottom
of
his
boat
if
you
are
and
can
prance
and
shout
for
a
long
time
he
may
eventually
stagger
to
his
feet
come
across
for
you
and
row
you
over
otherwise
you
will
stand
but
little
chance
of
arousing
him
from
his
slumbers
and
you
will
stop
where
you
are
unless
you
choose
to
walk
round
by
the
bridge
at
coton
a
mile
above
periodical
attempts
are
made
by
the
brisker
inhabitants
of
ashbridge
who
do
not
understand
its
spirit
to
substitute
for
this
aged
and
ineffectual
charon
someone
who
is
occasionally
awake
but
nothing
ever
results
from
these
revolutionary
moves
and
the
requests
addressed
to
the
town
council
on
the
subject
are
never
heard
of
again
old
george
was
ferryman
there
before
any
members
of
the
town
council
were
born
and
he
seems
to
have
established
a
right
to
go
to
sleep
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
which
is
now
inalienable
from
him
besides
asleep
or
awake
he
is
always
perfectly
sober
which
after
all
is
really
one
of
the
first
requirements
for
a
suitable
ferryman
even
the
representations
of
lord
ashbridge
himself
who
when
in
residence
frequently
has
occasion
to
use
the
ferry
when
crossing
from
his
house
to
the
town
failed
to
produce
the
smallest
effect
and
he
was
compelled
to
build
a
boathouse
of
his
own
on
the
farther
bank
and
be
paddled
across
by
himself
or
one
of
the
servants
often
he
rowed
himself
for
he
used
to
be
a
fine
oarsman
and
it
was
good
for
the
lounger
on
the
quay
to
see
the
foaming
prow
of
his
vigorous
progress
and
the
dignity
of
physical
toil
in
all
other
respects
except
in
this
case
of
old
george
lord
ashbridge
s
wishes
were
law
to
the
local
authorities
for
in
this
tranquil
district
the
spirit
of
the
feudal
system
with
a
beneficent
lord
and
contented
tenants
strongly
survived
it
had
triumphed
even
over
such
modern
innovations
as
railroads
for
lord
ashbridge
had
the
undoubted
right
to
stop
any
train
he
pleased
by
signal
at
ashbridge
station
this
he
certainly
enjoyed
doing
it
fed
his
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
to
progress
along
the
platform
with
his
genial
important
tiptoe
walk
and
elbows
squarely
stuck
out
to
the
carriage
that
was
at
once
reserved
for
him
to
touch
the
brim
of
his
grey
if
travelling
up
to
town
to
the
obsequious
guard
and
to
observe
the
heads
of
passengers
who
wondered
why
their
express
was
arrested
thrust
out
of
carriage
windows
to
look
at
him
a
livened
footman
as
well
as
a
valet
followed
him
bearing
a
coat
and
a
rug
and
a
morning
or
evening
paper
and
a
with
a
large
gilt
coronet
on
it
and
bestowed
these
solaces
to
a
railway
journey
on
the
empty
seats
near
him
and
not
only
his
sense
of
fitness
was
hereby
fed
but
that
also
of
the
and
the
solitary
porter
and
the
newsboy
and
such
inhabitants
of
ashbridge
as
happened
to
have
strolled
on
to
the
platform
for
he
was
their
earl
of
ashbridge
kind
courteous
and
dominant
a
local
king
it
was
all
very
pleasant
but
this
arrest
of
express
trains
was
a
strictly
personal
privilege
when
lady
ashbridge
or
michael
travelled
they
always
went
in
the
slow
train
to
stoneborough
changed
there
and
abided
their
time
on
the
platform
like
ordinary
mortals
though
he
could
undoubtedly
have
extended
his
rights
to
the
stopping
of
a
train
for
his
wife
or
son
he
wisely
reserved
this
for
himself
lest
it
should
lose
prestige
there
was
sufficient
glory
already
to
probe
his
mind
to
the
bottom
for
lady
ashbridge
in
being
his
wife
it
was
sufficient
also
for
michael
that
he
was
his
son
it
may
be
inferred
that
there
was
a
touch
of
pomposity
about
this
admirable
gentleman
who
was
so
excellent
a
landlord
and
so
hard
working
a
member
of
the
british
aristocracy
but
pomposity
would
be
far
too
superficial
a
word
to
apply
to
him
it
would
not
adequately
connote
his
and
essential
conviction
that
on
one
of
the
days
of
creation
that
probably
on
which
the
decree
was
made
that
there
should
be
light
there
leaped
into
being
the
great
landowners
of
england
but
lord
ashbridge
though
himself
a
peer
by
no
means
accepted
the
peerage
en
bloc
as
representing
the
english
aristocracy
to
be
in
his
phrase
one
of
us
implied
that
you
belonged
to
certain
families
where
brewers
and
distinguished
soldiers
had
no
place
unless
it
was
theirs
already
he
was
ready
to
pay
all
reasonable
homage
to
those
who
were
distinguished
by
their
abilities
their
riches
their
exalted
positions
in
church
and
state
but
his
homage
to
such
was
transfused
with
a
courteous
condescension
and
he
only
treated
as
his
equals
and
really
revered
those
who
belonged
to
the
families
that
were
one
of
his
wife
of
course
was
one
of
us
since
he
would
never
have
permitted
himself
to
be
allied
to
a
woman
who
was
not
though
for
beauty
and
wisdom
she
might
have
been
aphrodite
and
athene
rolled
compactly
into
one
peerless
identity
as
a
matter
of
fact
lady
ashbridge
had
not
the
faintest
resemblance
to
either
of
these
effulgent
goddesses
in
person
she
resembled
a
camel
long
and
lean
with
a
drooping
mouth
and
tired
patient
eyes
while
in
mind
she
was
stunned
no
idea
other
than
an
obvious
one
ever
had
birth
behind
her
high
smooth
forehead
and
she
habitually
brought
conversation
to
a
close
by
the
dry
enunciation
of
something
indubitably
true
which
had
no
direct
relation
to
the
point
under
discussion
but
she
had
faint
ineradicable
prejudices
and
instincts
not
quite
dormant
there
was
a
large
quantity
of
mild
affection
in
her
nature
the
quality
of
which
may
be
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
when
her
father
died
she
cried
a
little
every
day
after
breakfast
for
about
six
weeks
then
she
did
not
cry
any
more
it
was
impossible
not
to
like
what
there
was
of
her
but
there
was
really
very
little
to
like
for
she
belonged
heart
and
soul
to
the
generation
and
the
breeding
among
which
it
is
enough
for
a
woman
to
be
a
lady
and
visit
the
keeper
s
wife
when
she
has
a
baby
but
though
there
was
so
little
of
her
the
balance
was
made
up
for
by
the
fact
that
there
was
so
much
of
her
husband
his
large
rather
flamboyant
person
his
big
white
face
and
curling
brown
beard
his
loud
voice
and
his
falsetto
laugh
his
absolutely
certain
opinions
above
all
the
fervency
of
his
consciousness
of
being
lord
ashbridge
and
all
which
that
implied
completely
filled
any
place
he
happened
to
be
in
so
that
a
room
empty
except
for
him
gave
the
impression
of
being
almost
uncomfortably
crowded
this
keen
consciousness
of
his
identity
was
naturally
sufficient
to
make
him
very
good
humoured
since
he
was
himself
a
fine
example
of
the
type
that
he
admired
most
probably
only
two
persons
in
the
world
had
the
power
of
causing
him
annoyance
but
both
of
these
by
an
irony
of
fate
that
it
seemed
scarcely
possible
to
consider
accidental
were
closely
connected
with
him
for
one
was
his
sister
the
other
his
only
son
the
grounds
of
their
potentiality
in
this
respect
can
be
easily
stated
barbara
comber
his
sister
and
so
one
of
us
had
married
an
extremely
wealthy
american
who
in
lord
ashbridge
s
view
could
not
be
considered
one
of
anybody
at
all
in
other
words
his
imagination
failed
to
picture
a
whole
class
of
people
who
resembled
anthony
jerome
he
had
hoped
when
his
sister
announced
her
intention
of
taking
this
deplorable
step
that
his
future
would
at
any
rate
prove
to
be
a
snob
he
had
a
vague
notion
that
all
americans
were
snobs
and
that
thus
jerome
would
have
the
saving
grace
to
admire
and
toady
him
but
jerome
showed
no
signs
of
doing
anything
of
the
sort
he
treated
him
with
an
austere
and
distant
politeness
that
lord
ashbridge
could
not
construe
as
being
founded
on
admiration
and
a
sense
of
his
own
inferiority
for
it
was
so
clearly
founded
on
dislike
that
however
did
not
annoy
lord
ashbridge
for
it
was
easy
to
suppose
that
poor
jerome
knew
no
better
but
barbara
annoyed
him
for
not
only
had
she
shown
herself
a
renegade
in
marrying
a
man
who
was
not
one
of
us
but
with
all
the
advantages
she
had
enjoyed
since
birth
of
knowing
what
we
were
she
gloried
in
her
new
relations
saying
without
any
proper
reticence
about
the
matter
that
they
were
real
people
whose
character
and
wits
vastly
transcended
anything
that
combers
had
to
show
michael
was
an
even
more
vexatious
case
and
in
moments
of
depression
his
father
thought
that
he
would
really
turn
in
his
grave
at
the
dismal
idea
of
michael
having
stepped
into
his
honourable
shoes
physically
he
was
utterly
unlike
a
comber
and
his
mind
his
general
attitude
towards
life
seemed
to
have
diverged
even
farther
from
that
healthy
and
unreflective
pattern
only
this
morning
his
father
had
received
a
letter
from
him
that
summed
michael
up
that
fulfilled
all
the
doubts
and
fears
that
had
hung
about
him
for
after
three
years
in
the
guards
he
had
without
consultation
with
anybody
resigned
his
commission
on
the
inexplicable
grounds
that
he
wanted
to
do
something
with
his
life
to
begin
with
that
was
rankly
heretical
if
you
were
a
comber
there
was
no
need
to
do
anything
with
your
life
life
did
everything
for
you
and
what
this
young
man
wanted
to
do
with
his
life
was
to
be
a
musician
that
musicians
artists
actors
had
a
right
to
exist
lord
ashbridge
did
not
question
they
were
no
doubt
or
might
be
very
excellent
people
in
their
way
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
often
recognised
their
existence
by
going
to
the
opera
to
the
private
view
of
the
academy
or
to
the
play
and
he
took
a
very
considerable
pride
of
proprietorship
in
his
own
admirable
collection
of
family
portraits
but
then
those
were
pictures
of
combers
reynolds
and
romney
and
the
rest
of
them
had
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
perpetuating
on
their
canvases
these
big
fine
men
and
charming
women
but
that
a
comber
and
that
one
positively
the
next
lord
ashbridge
should
intend
to
devote
his
energies
to
an
artistic
calling
and
allude
to
that
scheme
as
doing
something
with
his
life
was
a
thing
as
unthinkable
as
if
the
butler
had
developed
a
fixed
idea
that
he
was
one
of
the
blow
was
a
recent
one
michael
s
letter
had
only
reached
his
father
this
morning
and
at
the
present
moment
lord
ashbridge
was
attempting
over
a
cup
of
tea
on
the
long
south
terrace
overlooking
the
estuary
to
convey
not
very
successfully
to
his
wife
something
of
his
feelings
on
the
subject
she
according
to
her
custom
was
drinking
a
little
hot
water
herself
and
providing
her
chinese
pug
with
a
mixture
of
cream
and
crumbled
rusks
though
the
dog
was
of
undoubtedly
high
lineage
lord
ashbridge
rather
detested
her
a
musical
career
he
exclaimed
referring
to
michael
s
letter
what
sort
of
a
career
for
a
comber
is
a
musical
career
i
shall
tell
michael
pretty
roundly
when
he
arrives
this
evening
what
i
think
of
it
all
we
shall
have
francis
next
saying
that
he
wants
to
resign
too
and
become
a
lady
ashbridge
considered
this
for
a
moment
in
her
stunned
mind
dear
me
robert
i
hope
not
she
said
i
do
not
think
it
the
least
likely
that
francis
would
do
anything
of
the
kind
look
petsy
is
better
she
has
drunk
her
cream
and
rusks
quite
up
i
think
it
was
only
the
he
gave
a
little
giggle
of
falsetto
laughter
i
wish
marion
he
said
that
you
could
manage
to
take
your
mind
off
your
dog
for
a
moment
and
attend
to
me
and
i
must
really
ask
you
not
to
give
your
petsy
any
more
cream
or
she
will
certainly
be
lady
ashbridge
gave
a
little
sigh
all
gone
petsy
she
said
i
am
glad
it
has
all
gone
said
he
and
we
will
hope
it
won
t
return
but
about
michael
now
lady
ashbridge
pulled
herself
together
yes
poor
michael
she
said
he
is
coming
is
he
not
but
just
now
you
were
speaking
of
francis
and
the
fear
of
his
wanting
to
be
a
dentist
well
i
am
now
speaking
of
michael
s
wanting
to
be
a
musician
of
course
that
is
utterly
out
of
the
question
if
as
he
says
he
has
sent
in
his
resignation
he
will
just
have
to
beg
them
to
cancel
it
michael
seems
not
to
have
the
slightest
idea
of
the
duties
which
his
birth
and
position
entail
on
him
unfitted
for
the
life
he
now
leads
waste
of
time
instead
he
proposes
to
go
to
baireuth
in
august
and
then
to
settle
down
in
london
to
study
lady
ashbridge
recollected
the
almanac
that
will
be
in
september
then
she
said
i
do
not
think
i
was
ever
in
london
in
september
i
did
not
know
that
anybody
the
point
my
dear
is
not
how
or
where
you
have
been
accustomed
to
spend
your
septembers
said
her
husband
what
we
are
talking
about
is
yes
dear
i
know
quite
well
what
we
are
talking
about
said
she
we
are
talking
about
michael
not
studying
music
all
lord
ashbridge
got
up
and
began
walking
across
the
terrace
opposite
the
with
his
elbows
stuck
out
and
his
feet
lifted
rather
high
michael
doesn
t
seem
to
realise
that
he
is
not
tom
or
dick
or
harry
said
he
music
indeed
i
m
musical
myself
all
we
combers
are
musical
but
michael
is
my
only
son
and
it
really
distresses
me
to
see
how
little
sense
he
has
of
his
responsibilities
amusements
are
all
very
well
it
is
not
that
i
want
to
cut
him
off
his
amusements
but
when
it
comes
to
a
career
lady
ashbridge
was
surreptitiously
engaged
in
pouring
out
a
little
more
cream
for
petsy
and
her
husband
turning
rather
sooner
than
she
had
expected
caught
her
in
the
act
do
not
give
petsy
any
more
cream
he
said
with
some
asperity
i
absolutely
forbid
lady
ashbridge
quite
composedly
replaced
the
poor
petsy
she
observed
i
ask
you
to
attend
to
me
marion
he
said
but
i
am
attending
to
you
very
well
robert
said
she
and
i
understand
you
perfectly
you
do
not
want
michael
to
be
a
musician
in
september
and
wear
long
hair
and
perhaps
play
at
concerts
i
am
sure
i
quite
agree
with
you
for
such
a
thing
would
be
as
unheard
of
in
my
family
as
in
yours
but
how
do
you
propose
to
stop
it
i
shall
use
my
authority
he
said
stepping
a
little
higher
yes
dear
i
am
sure
you
will
but
what
will
happen
if
michael
doesn
t
pay
any
attention
to
your
authority
you
will
be
worse
off
than
ever
poor
michael
is
very
obedient
when
he
is
told
to
do
anything
he
intends
to
do
but
when
he
doesn
t
agree
it
is
difficult
to
do
anything
with
him
and
you
see
he
is
quite
independent
of
you
with
my
mother
having
left
him
so
much
money
poor
mamma
lord
ashbridge
felt
strongly
about
this
it
was
a
most
extraordinary
disposition
of
her
property
for
your
mother
to
make
he
observed
it
has
given
michael
an
independence
which
i
much
deplore
and
she
did
it
in
direct
opposition
to
my
this
touched
on
one
of
the
questions
about
which
lady
ashbridge
had
her
convictions
she
had
a
mild
but
unalterable
opinion
that
when
anybody
died
all
that
they
had
previously
done
became
absolutely
flawless
and
laudable
mamma
did
as
she
thought
right
with
her
property
she
said
and
it
is
not
for
us
to
question
it
she
was
conscientiousness
itself
you
will
have
to
excuse
my
listening
to
any
criticism
you
may
feel
inclined
to
make
about
her
certainly
my
dear
i
only
want
you
to
listen
to
me
about
michael
you
agree
with
me
on
the
impossibility
of
his
adopting
a
musical
career
i
can
not
at
present
think
so
ill
of
michael
as
to
suppose
that
he
will
defy
our
joint
michael
has
a
great
will
of
his
own
she
remarked
he
gets
that
from
you
robert
though
he
gets
his
money
from
his
the
futility
of
further
discussion
with
his
wife
began
to
dawn
on
lord
ashbridge
as
it
dawned
on
everybody
who
had
the
privilege
of
conversing
with
her
her
mind
was
a
blind
alley
that
led
nowhere
it
was
clear
that
she
had
no
idea
to
contribute
to
the
subject
except
slightly
pessimistic
forebodings
with
which
unfortunately
he
found
himself
secretly
disposed
to
agree
he
had
always
felt
that
michael
was
an
uncomfortable
sort
of
boy
in
other
words
that
he
had
the
inconvenient
habit
of
thinking
things
out
for
himself
instead
of
blindly
accepting
the
conclusions
of
other
people
much
as
lord
ashbridge
valued
the
sturdy
independence
of
character
which
he
himself
enjoyed
displaying
he
appreciated
it
rather
less
highly
when
it
was
manifested
by
people
who
were
not
sensible
enough
to
agree
with
him
he
looked
forward
to
michael
s
arrival
that
evening
with
the
feeling
that
there
was
a
rebellious
standard
hoisted
against
the
calm
blue
of
the
evening
sky
and
remembering
the
advent
of
his
sister
he
wondered
whether
she
would
not
join
the
insurgent
barbara
jerome
as
has
been
remarked
often
annoyed
her
brother
she
also
genially
laughed
at
him
but
lord
ashbridge
partly
from
affection
partly
from
a
loyal
family
sense
of
clanship
always
expected
his
sister
to
spend
a
fortnight
with
him
in
august
and
would
have
been
much
hurt
had
she
refused
to
do
so
her
husband
however
so
far
from
spending
a
fortnight
with
his
never
spent
a
minute
in
his
presence
if
it
could
possibly
be
avoided
an
arrangement
which
everybody
concerned
considered
to
be
wise
and
in
the
interests
of
cordiality
and
barbara
comes
this
evening
as
well
as
michael
does
she
not
he
said
i
hope
she
will
not
take
michael
s
part
in
his
absurd
i
have
given
barbara
the
blue
room
said
lady
ashbridge
after
a
little
thought
i
am
afraid
she
may
bring
her
great
dog
with
her
i
hope
he
will
not
quarrel
with
petsy
petsy
does
not
like
other
the
day
had
been
very
hot
and
lord
ashbridge
not
having
taken
any
exercise
went
off
to
have
a
round
of
golf
with
the
professional
of
the
links
that
lay
not
half
a
mile
from
the
house
he
considered
exercise
an
essential
part
of
the
true
englishman
s
daily
curriculum
and
as
necessary
a
contribution
to
the
traditional
mode
of
life
which
made
them
all
what
they
were
or
should
be
as
a
bath
in
the
morning
or
attendance
at
church
on
sunday
he
did
not
care
so
much
about
playing
golf
with
a
casual
friend
because
the
casual
friend
as
a
rule
casually
beat
him
thus
putting
him
in
an
position
and
preferred
a
game
with
this
professional
whose
duty
it
was
in
complete
violation
of
his
capacities
to
play
just
badly
enough
to
be
beaten
towards
the
end
of
the
round
after
an
exciting
match
it
required
a
good
deal
of
cleverness
and
to
accomplish
this
for
lord
ashbridge
was
a
notably
puerile
performer
but
he
generally
managed
it
with
tact
and
success
by
dint
of
missing
absurdly
easy
putts
and
here
his
skill
came
in
by
pulling
and
slicing
his
ball
into
bunkers
throughout
the
game
it
was
his
business
to
keep
up
a
running
fire
of
admiring
ejaculations
such
as
well
driven
my
lord
or
a
fine
putt
my
lord
ah
dear
me
i
wish
i
could
putt
like
that
though
occasionally
his
chorus
of
praise
betrayed
him
into
error
and
from
habit
he
found
himself
saying
good
shot
my
lord
when
my
lord
had
just
made
an
egregious
mess
of
things
but
on
the
whole
he
devised
so
pleasantly
sycophantic
an
atmosphere
as
to
procure
a
substantial
tip
for
himself
and
to
make
lord
ashbridge
conscious
of
being
a
very
superior
performer
whether
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
knew
he
could
not
play
at
all
he
probably
did
not
inquire
the
result
of
his
matches
and
his
opponent
s
praise
was
sufficient
for
him
so
now
he
left
the
discouraging
companionship
of
his
wife
and
petsy
and
walked
swingingly
across
the
garden
and
the
park
to
the
links
there
to
seek
in
macpherson
s
applause
the
that
would
enable
him
to
encounter
his
republican
sister
and
his
musical
son
with
an
unyielding
front
his
spirits
mounted
rapidly
as
he
went
it
pleased
him
to
go
jauntily
across
the
lawn
and
reflect
that
all
this
smooth
turf
was
his
to
look
at
the
wealth
of
flowers
in
his
garden
and
know
that
all
this
polychromatic
loveliness
was
bred
in
lord
ashbridge
s
borders
and
was
graciously
thrown
open
to
the
gaze
of
the
admiring
public
on
sunday
afternoon
when
they
were
begged
to
keep
off
the
grass
and
that
lord
ashbridge
was
himself
he
liked
reminding
himself
that
the
towering
elms
drew
their
leafy
verdure
from
lord
ashbridge
s
soil
that
the
rows
of
in
the
park
populous
and
cheeping
with
infant
pheasants
belonged
to
the
same
fortunate
gentleman
who
in
november
would
so
unerringly
shoot
them
down
as
they
rocketted
swiftly
over
the
highest
of
his
that
to
him
also
appertained
the
jacobean
house
which
stood
so
commandingly
upon
the
and
glowed
with
all
the
mellowness
of
its
bricks
and
his
satisfaction
was
not
wholly
fatuous
nor
entirely
personal
all
these
spacious
dignities
were
insignia
temporarily
conferred
on
him
like
some
order
and
permanently
conferred
on
his
family
of
the
splendid
political
constitution
under
which
england
had
made
herself
mistress
of
an
empire
and
the
seas
that
guarded
it
probably
he
would
have
been
proud
of
belonging
to
that
even
if
he
had
not
been
one
of
us
as
it
was
the
high
position
which
he
occupied
in
it
caused
that
pride
to
be
slightly
mixed
with
the
pride
that
was
concerned
with
the
notion
of
the
empire
belonging
to
him
and
his
peers
but
though
he
was
the
most
profound
of
tories
he
would
truthfully
have
professed
as
indeed
he
practised
in
the
management
of
his
estates
the
most
liberal
opinions
as
to
schemes
for
the
amelioration
of
the
lower
classes
only
just
as
the
music
he
was
good
enough
to
listen
to
had
to
be
played
for
him
so
the
tenants
and
farmers
had
to
be
his
dependents
he
looked
after
them
very
well
indeed
conceiving
this
to
be
the
prime
duty
of
a
great
landlord
but
his
interest
in
them
was
really
proprietary
it
was
of
his
bounty
and
of
his
complete
knowledge
of
what
his
duties
as
one
of
us
were
that
he
did
so
and
any
legislation
which
compelled
him
to
part
with
one
pennyworth
of
his
property
for
the
sake
of
others
less
fortunate
he
resisted
to
the
best
of
his
ability
as
a
theft
of
what
was
his
the
country
in
fact
if
it
went
to
the
dogs
and
certain
recent
legislation
distinctly
seemed
to
point
kennelwards
would
go
to
the
dogs
because
ignorant
politicians
who
were
most
emphatically
not
of
us
forced
him
and
others
like
him
to
recognise
the
rights
of
dependents
instead
of
trusting
to
their
instinctive
fitness
to
dispense
benefits
not
as
rights
but
as
acts
of
grace
if
england
trusted
to
her
aristocracy
to
put
the
matter
in
a
nutshell
all
would
be
well
with
her
in
the
future
even
as
it
had
been
in
the
past
but
any
attempt
to
curtail
their
splendours
must
inevitably
detract
from
the
prestige
and
magnificence
of
the
empire
and
he
responded
suitably
to
the
obsequious
salute
of
the
professional
and
remembered
that
the
entire
golf
links
were
his
property
and
that
the
club
paid
a
merely
nominal
rental
to
him
just
the
tribute
money
of
a
penny
which
was
due
to
caesar
for
the
next
hour
or
two
after
her
husband
had
left
her
lady
ashbridge
occupied
herself
in
the
thoroughly
pursuit
of
doing
nothing
whatever
she
just
existed
in
her
comfortable
chair
since
barbara
might
come
any
moment
and
she
would
have
to
entertain
her
which
she
frequently
did
unawares
but
as
barbara
continued
not
to
come
she
took
up
her
perennial
piece
of
needlework
feeling
rather
busy
and
pressed
and
had
hardly
done
so
when
her
arrived
she
was
preceded
by
an
enormous
who
having
been
shut
up
in
her
motor
all
the
way
from
london
bounded
delightedly
with
the
sense
of
young
limbs
released
on
to
the
terrace
and
made
wild
leaps
in
a
circle
round
the
horrified
petsy
who
had
just
received
a
second
saucerful
of
cream
once
he
dashed
in
close
and
with
a
single
lick
of
his
tongue
swept
the
saucer
dry
of
nutriment
and
with
hoarse
barkings
proceeded
again
to
dance
corybantically
about
while
lady
ashbridge
with
faint
cries
of
dismay
waved
her
embroidery
at
him
then
seeing
his
mistress
coming
out
of
the
french
window
from
the
he
bounded
towards
her
and
petsy
nearly
sick
with
cream
and
horror
was
gathered
to
lady
ashbridge
s
bosom
my
dear
barbara
she
said
how
upsetting
your
dog
is
poor
petsy
s
heart
is
beating
terribly
she
does
not
like
dogs
but
i
am
very
pleased
to
see
you
and
i
have
given
you
the
blue
it
was
clearly
suitable
that
barbara
jerome
should
have
a
large
dog
for
both
in
mind
and
body
she
was
on
the
large
scale
herself
she
had
a
pleasant
face
was
very
tall
enormously
stout
and
moved
with
great
briskness
and
vigour
she
had
something
to
say
on
any
subject
that
came
on
the
board
and
what
was
less
usual
in
these
days
of
universal
knowledge
there
was
invariably
some
point
in
what
she
said
she
had
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
no
manners
at
all
but
essentially
made
up
for
this
lack
by
her
sincere
and
humourous
kindliness
she
saw
with
acute
vividness
the
ludicrous
side
of
everybody
herself
included
and
to
her
mind
the
of
all
was
her
brother
whom
she
was
quite
unable
to
take
seriously
she
dressed
as
if
she
had
looted
a
milliner
s
shop
and
had
put
on
in
a
great
hurry
anything
that
came
to
hand
she
towered
over
her
as
she
kissed
her
and
petsy
safe
in
her
citadel
barked
shrilly
my
dear
which
is
the
blue
room
she
said
i
hope
it
is
big
enough
for
og
and
me
yes
that
is
og
which
is
short
for
dog
he
takes
two
for
dinner
and
a
little
something
during
the
night
if
he
feels
disposed
because
he
is
still
growing
tony
drove
down
with
me
and
is
in
the
car
now
he
would
not
come
in
for
fear
of
seeing
robert
so
i
ventured
to
tell
them
to
take
him
a
cup
of
tea
there
which
he
will
drink
with
the
blinds
down
and
then
drive
back
to
town
again
he
has
been
made
american
ambassador
by
the
way
and
will
go
in
to
dinner
before
robert
my
dear
i
can
think
of
few
things
which
robert
is
less
fitted
to
bear
than
that
however
we
all
have
our
crosses
even
those
of
us
who
have
our
coronets
lady
ashbridge
s
hospitable
instincts
asserted
themselves
but
your
husband
must
come
in
she
said
i
will
go
and
tell
him
and
robert
has
gone
to
play
barbara
laughed
i
am
quite
sure
tony
won
t
come
in
she
said
i
promised
him
he
shouldn
t
and
he
only
drove
down
with
me
on
the
express
stipulation
that
no
risks
were
to
be
run
about
his
seeing
robert
we
must
take
no
chances
so
let
him
have
his
tea
quietly
in
the
motor
and
then
drive
away
again
and
who
else
is
there
anybody
michael
michael
comes
this
i
am
glad
i
am
particularly
fond
of
michael
also
he
will
play
to
us
after
dinner
and
though
i
don
t
know
one
note
from
another
it
will
relieve
me
of
sitting
in
a
stately
circle
watching
robert
cheat
at
patience
i
always
find
the
evenings
here
rather
trying
they
remind
me
of
being
in
church
i
feel
as
if
i
were
part
of
a
corporate
body
which
leads
to
misplaced
decorum
ah
there
is
the
sound
of
tony
s
retreating
motor
his
strategic
movement
has
come
off
and
now
give
me
some
news
if
you
can
get
in
a
word
dear
me
there
is
robert
coming
back
across
the
lawn
what
a
mercy
that
tony
did
not
leave
the
motor
robert
always
walks
as
if
he
was
dancing
a
minuet
look
there
is
og
imitating
him
or
is
he
stalking
him
thinking
he
is
an
enemy
og
come
here
she
whistled
shrilly
on
her
fingers
and
rose
to
greet
her
brother
whom
og
was
still
menacing
as
he
advanced
towards
her
with
staccato
steps
barbara
however
got
between
og
and
his
prey
and
threw
her
parasol
at
him
my
dear
how
are
you
she
said
and
how
did
the
golf
go
and
did
you
beat
the
professional
he
suspected
flippancy
here
and
became
markedly
dignified
an
excellent
match
he
said
and
macpherson
tells
me
i
played
a
very
sound
game
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
barbara
and
did
michael
come
down
with
you
no
i
drove
from
town
it
saves
time
but
not
expense
with
your
awful
and
you
are
well
and
jerome
he
asked
he
always
called
his
jerome
to
indicate
the
gulf
between
them
barbara
gave
a
little
spurt
of
laughter
yes
his
excellency
is
quite
well
she
said
you
must
call
him
excellency
now
my
indeed
that
is
a
great
considering
that
tony
began
as
an
how
richly
rewarding
you
are
my
dear
and
shan
t
i
make
an
odd
ambassadress
i
haven
t
been
to
a
court
since
the
dark
ages
when
i
went
to
those
beloved
states
we
will
practise
after
dinner
dear
and
you
and
marion
shall
be
the
king
and
queen
and
i
will
try
to
walk
backwards
without
tumbling
on
my
head
you
will
like
being
the
king
robert
and
then
we
will
be
ourselves
again
all
except
og
who
shall
be
tony
and
shall
go
out
of
the
room
before
he
gave
his
treble
little
giggle
for
on
the
whole
it
answered
better
not
to
be
dignified
with
barbara
whenever
he
could
remember
not
to
be
and
lady
ashbridge
still
nursing
petsy
threw
a
bombshell
of
the
obvious
to
explode
the
conversation
og
has
two
for
his
dinner
she
said
and
he
is
growing
still
fancy
lord
ashbridge
took
a
refreshing
glance
at
the
broad
stretch
of
country
that
all
belonged
to
him
i
am
rather
glad
to
have
this
opportunity
of
talking
to
you
my
dear
barbara
he
said
before
michael
his
train
gets
in
half
an
hour
before
dinner
said
lady
ashbridge
he
has
to
change
at
quite
so
i
heard
from
michael
this
morning
saying
that
he
has
resigned
his
commission
in
the
guards
and
is
going
to
take
up
music
barbara
gave
a
delighted
exclamation
but
how
perfectly
splendid
she
said
fancy
a
comber
doing
anything
original
michael
and
i
are
the
only
combers
who
ever
have
since
combers
arose
from
out
the
azure
main
in
the
year
one
i
married
an
american
that
s
something
though
it
s
not
up
to
michael
that
is
not
quite
my
view
of
it
said
he
as
for
its
being
original
it
would
be
original
enough
if
marion
eloped
with
a
lady
ashbridge
let
fall
her
embroidery
at
this
monstrous
suggestion
you
are
talking
very
wildly
robert
she
said
in
a
pained
voice
my
dear
get
on
with
your
sacred
carpet
said
he
i
am
talking
to
barbara
i
have
already
ascertained
your
your
lack
of
views
on
the
subject
i
was
saying
barbara
that
mere
originality
is
not
a
no
you
never
said
that
remarked
lady
ashbridge
i
should
have
if
you
had
allowed
me
to
and
as
for
your
saying
that
he
has
done
it
barbara
that
is
very
wide
of
the
mark
and
i
intend
shall
continue
to
be
dear
great
bashaw
that
is
just
what
you
said
to
me
when
i
told
you
i
was
going
to
marry
his
excellency
but
i
did
and
i
think
it
is
a
glorious
move
on
michael
s
part
it
requires
brain
to
find
out
what
you
like
and
character
to
go
and
do
it
combers
haven
t
got
brains
as
a
rule
you
see
if
they
ever
had
any
they
have
degenerated
into
conservative
he
again
refreshed
himself
with
the
landscape
the
roofs
of
ashbridge
were
visible
in
the
clear
sunset
ashbridge
paid
its
rents
with
remarkable
regularity
that
may
or
may
not
be
so
he
said
forgetting
for
a
moment
the
danger
of
being
dignified
but
combers
have
barbara
controlled
herself
admirably
a
slight
tremor
shook
her
which
he
did
not
notice
yes
dear
she
said
i
allow
that
combers
have
had
for
many
generations
a
sort
of
acquisitive
cunning
for
all
we
possess
has
come
to
us
by
exceedingly
prudent
marriages
they
have
also
i
am
an
exception
here
the
gift
of
not
saying
very
much
which
certainly
has
an
impressive
effect
even
when
it
arises
from
not
having
very
much
to
say
they
are
sticky
they
attract
wealth
and
they
have
the
force
called
vis
inertiae
which
means
that
they
invest
their
money
prudently
you
should
hear
tony
well
perhaps
you
had
better
not
hear
tony
but
now
here
is
michael
showing
that
he
has
got
tastes
can
you
wonder
that
i
m
delighted
and
not
only
has
he
got
tastes
but
he
has
the
strength
of
character
to
back
them
michael
in
the
guards
too
it
was
a
perfect
farce
and
he
s
had
the
sense
to
see
it
he
hated
his
duties
and
he
hated
his
diversions
now
francis
i
am
afraid
michael
has
always
been
a
little
jealous
of
francis
remarked
his
father
this
roused
barbara
she
spoke
quite
seriously
if
you
really
think
that
my
dear
she
said
you
have
the
distinction
of
being
the
worst
possible
judge
of
character
that
the
world
has
ever
known
michael
might
be
jealous
of
anybody
else
for
the
poor
boy
feels
his
physical
awkwardness
most
sensitively
but
francis
is
just
the
one
person
he
really
worships
he
would
do
anything
in
the
world
for
the
discussion
with
barbara
was
being
even
more
fruitless
than
that
with
his
wife
and
lord
ashbridge
rose
all
i
can
do
then
is
to
ask
you
not
to
back
michael
up
he
said
my
dear
he
won
t
need
backing
up
he
s
a
match
for
you
by
himself
but
if
michael
after
thoroughly
worsting
you
asks
me
my
opinion
i
shall
certainly
give
it
him
but
he
won
t
ask
my
opinion
first
he
will
strew
your
limbs
robert
over
this
delightful
michael
s
train
is
late
said
lady
ashbridge
hearing
the
stable
clock
strike
he
should
have
been
here
before
barbara
had
still
a
word
to
say
and
disregarded
this
quencher
but
don
t
think
robert
she
said
that
because
michael
resists
your
wishes
and
authority
he
will
be
enjoying
himself
he
will
hate
doing
it
but
that
will
not
stop
lord
ashbridge
was
not
a
bully
he
had
merely
a
profound
sense
of
his
own
importance
we
will
see
about
resistance
he
said
barbara
was
not
so
successful
on
this
occasion
and
exploded
loudly
you
will
dear
indeed
she
said
michael
meantime
had
been
travelling
down
from
london
without
perturbing
himself
over
the
scene
with
his
father
which
he
knew
lay
before
him
this
was
quite
characteristic
of
him
he
had
a
singular
command
over
his
imagination
when
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
anything
and
never
indulged
in
the
gratuitous
pain
of
anticipation
today
he
had
an
additional
bulwark
against
such
worries
for
he
had
spent
his
last
two
hours
in
town
at
the
vocal
recital
of
a
singer
who
a
month
before
had
stirred
the
critics
into
rhapsody
over
her
gift
of
lyric
song
up
till
now
he
had
had
no
opportunity
of
hearing
her
and
with
the
panegyrics
that
had
been
showered
on
her
in
his
mind
he
had
gone
with
the
expectation
of
disappointment
but
now
an
hour
afterwards
the
wheels
of
the
train
sang
her
songs
and
in
the
inward
ear
he
could
recapture
with
the
vividness
of
an
hallucination
the
timbre
of
that
wonderful
voice
and
also
the
sweet
harmonies
of
the
pianist
who
accompanied
her
the
hall
had
been
packed
from
end
to
end
and
he
had
barely
got
to
his
seat
the
only
one
vacant
in
the
whole
room
when
miss
sylvia
falbe
appeared
followed
at
once
by
her
accompanist
whose
name
occurred
nowhere
on
the
programme
two
neighbours
however
who
chatted
shrilly
during
the
applause
that
greeted
them
informed
him
that
this
was
hermann
dear
hermann
there
is
no
one
like
him
but
it
occurred
to
michael
that
the
singer
was
like
him
though
she
was
fair
and
he
dark
but
his
perception
of
either
of
them
visually
was
but
vague
he
had
come
to
hear
and
not
to
see
neither
she
nor
hermann
had
any
music
with
them
and
hermann
just
glanced
at
the
programme
which
he
put
down
on
the
top
of
the
piano
which
again
unusually
was
open
then
without
pause
they
began
the
set
of
german
songs
brahms
schubert
schumann
with
which
the
recital
opened
and
for
one
moment
before
he
lost
himself
in
the
ecstasy
of
hearing
michael
found
himself
registering
the
fact
that
sylvia
falbe
had
one
of
the
most
charming
faces
he
had
ever
seen
the
next
he
was
swallowed
up
in
melody
she
had
the
ease
of
the
consummate
artist
and
each
note
like
the
gates
of
the
new
jerusalem
was
a
pearl
round
and
smooth
and
luminous
almost
so
that
it
was
as
if
light
came
from
her
lips
nor
was
that
all
it
seemed
as
if
the
accompaniment
was
made
by
the
song
itself
coming
into
life
with
the
freshness
of
the
dawn
of
its
creation
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
one
mind
directed
the
singer
and
another
the
pianist
and
if
the
voice
was
an
example
of
art
in
excelsis
not
less
exalted
was
the
perfection
of
the
player
not
for
a
moment
through
the
song
did
he
take
his
eyes
off
her
he
looked
at
her
with
an
intensity
of
gaze
that
seemed
to
be
reading
the
emotion
with
which
the
lovely
melody
filled
her
for
herself
she
looked
straight
out
over
the
hall
with
grey
eyes
and
mouth
that
in
the
pauses
of
her
song
was
large
and
generously
curving
and
face
that
seemed
lit
with
the
light
of
the
morning
she
sang
of
she
was
the
song
michael
thought
of
her
as
just
that
and
the
pianist
who
watched
and
understood
her
so
unerringly
was
the
song
too
they
had
for
him
no
identity
of
their
own
they
were
as
remote
from
everyday
life
as
the
mind
of
schumann
which
they
made
so
vivid
it
was
then
that
they
existed
the
last
song
of
the
group
she
sang
in
english
for
it
was
who
is
sylvia
there
was
a
buzz
of
smiles
and
whispers
among
the
front
row
in
the
pause
before
it
and
regaining
her
own
identity
for
a
moment
she
smiled
at
a
group
of
her
friends
among
whom
clearly
it
was
a
cliche
species
of
joke
that
she
should
ask
who
sylvia
was
and
enumerate
her
merits
when
all
the
time
she
was
sylvia
michael
felt
rather
impatient
at
this
she
was
not
anybody
just
now
but
a
singer
and
then
came
the
divine
inevitable
simplicity
of
perfect
words
and
the
melody
preordained
for
them
the
singer
as
he
knew
was
german
but
she
had
no
trace
of
foreign
accent
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
was
just
one
miracle
the
more
she
had
become
english
because
she
was
singing
what
shakespeare
wrote
the
next
group
consisting
of
modern
french
songs
appeared
to
michael
utterly
unworthy
of
the
singer
and
the
echoing
piano
if
you
had
it
in
you
to
give
reality
to
great
and
simple
things
it
was
surely
a
waste
to
concern
yourself
with
these
little
morbid
melancholy
manikins
these
marionettes
but
his
emotions
being
unoccupied
he
attended
more
to
the
manner
of
the
performance
and
in
especial
to
the
marvellous
technique
not
so
much
of
the
singer
but
of
the
pianist
who
caused
the
rain
to
fall
and
the
waters
reflect
the
toneless
grey
skies
he
had
never
even
when
listening
to
the
great
masters
heard
so
flawless
a
comprehension
as
this
anonymous
player
incidentally
known
as
hermann
exhibited
as
far
as
mere
manipulation
went
it
was
as
might
perhaps
be
expected
entirely
effortless
but
effortless
no
less
was
the
understanding
of
the
music
it
happened
it
was
like
that
all
of
this
so
filled
michael
s
mind
as
he
travelled
down
that
evening
to
ashbridge
that
he
scarcely
remembered
the
errand
on
which
he
went
and
when
it
occurred
to
him
it
instantly
sank
out
of
sight
again
lost
in
the
recollection
of
the
music
which
he
had
heard
and
which
belonged
to
the
art
that
claimed
the
allegiance
of
his
soul
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
was
alchemised
into
song
and
as
with
eyes
he
listened
to
it
there
swam
across
it
now
the
full
face
of
the
singer
now
the
profile
of
the
pianist
that
had
stood
out
white
and
intent
against
the
dark
panelling
behind
his
head
he
had
gleaned
one
fact
at
the
as
he
hurried
out
to
catch
his
train
this
hermann
was
the
singer
s
brother
a
teacher
of
the
piano
in
london
and
apparently
highly
thought
of
chapter
iii
michael
s
train
as
his
mother
had
so
infallibly
pronounced
was
late
and
he
had
arrived
only
just
in
time
to
hurry
to
his
room
and
dress
quickly
in
order
not
to
add
to
his
crimes
the
additional
one
of
unpunctuality
for
unpunctuality
so
lord
ashbridge
held
was
the
politeness
not
only
of
kings
but
of
all
who
had
any
pretence
to
decent
breeding
his
father
gave
him
a
welcome
his
mother
the
tip
of
her
long
lips
and
they
waited
solemnly
for
the
appearance
of
aunt
barbara
who
it
would
seem
had
forfeited
her
claims
to
family
by
her
marriage
a
and
a
half
looked
after
each
of
them
at
dinner
and
the
twelve
lord
ashbridges
in
uniform
looked
down
from
their
illuminated
frames
on
their
degenerate
descendant
the
only
bright
spot
in
this
portentous
banquet
was
aunt
barbara
who
had
chosen
that
evening
with
what
intention
may
possibly
be
guessed
to
put
on
an
immense
diamond
tiara
and
a
breastplate
of
rubies
while
og
after
one
futile
attempt
to
play
with
the
footmen
yielded
himself
up
to
the
chilling
atmosphere
of
good
breeding
and
ate
his
with
great
composure
but
aunt
barbara
fortified
by
her
gems
ate
an
excellent
dinner
and
talked
all
the
time
with
occasional
bursts
of
unexplained
laughter
afterwards
when
michael
was
left
alone
with
his
father
he
found
that
his
best
efforts
at
conversation
elicited
only
monosyllabic
replies
and
at
last
in
the
despairing
desire
to
bring
things
to
a
head
he
asked
him
if
he
had
received
his
letter
an
affirmative
monosyllable
followed
by
the
hissing
of
lord
ashbridge
s
cigarette
end
as
he
dropped
it
into
his
coffee
cup
answered
him
and
he
perceived
that
the
approaching
storm
was
to
be
rendered
duly
impressive
by
the
thundery
stillness
that
preceded
it
then
his
father
rose
and
as
he
passed
michael
who
held
the
door
open
for
him
said
if
you
can
spare
the
time
michael
i
would
like
to
have
a
talk
with
you
when
your
mother
and
aunt
have
gone
to
that
was
not
very
long
delayed
michael
imagined
that
aunt
barbara
must
have
had
a
hint
for
before
ten
she
announced
with
a
skilfully
suppressed
laugh
that
she
was
about
to
retire
and
kissed
michael
affectionately
both
her
laugh
and
her
salute
were
encouraging
he
felt
that
he
was
being
backed
up
then
a
procession
of
footmen
came
into
the
room
bearing
lemonade
and
soda
water
and
whiskey
and
a
plate
of
plain
biscuits
and
the
moment
after
he
was
alone
with
his
father
lord
ashbridge
rose
and
walked
very
tall
and
majestic
to
the
fireplace
where
he
stood
for
a
moment
with
his
back
to
his
son
then
he
turned
round
now
about
this
nonsense
of
your
resigning
your
commission
michael
he
said
i
don
t
propose
to
argue
about
it
and
i
am
just
going
to
tell
you
if
as
you
have
informed
me
you
have
actually
sent
it
in
you
will
write
with
due
apologies
and
ask
that
it
may
be
withdrawn
i
will
see
your
letter
before
you
send
michael
had
intended
to
be
as
quiet
and
respectful
as
possible
consistent
with
firmness
but
a
sentence
here
gave
him
a
spasm
of
anger
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
sir
he
said
by
saying
if
i
have
sent
it
you
have
received
my
letter
in
which
i
tell
you
that
i
have
done
already
even
at
the
first
words
there
was
bad
blood
between
them
michael
s
face
had
clouded
with
that
gloom
which
his
father
would
certainly
call
sulky
and
for
himself
he
resented
the
tone
of
michael
s
reply
to
make
matters
worse
he
gave
his
little
falsetto
cackle
which
no
doubt
was
intended
to
convey
the
impression
of
confident
good
humour
but
there
was
it
must
be
confessed
very
little
good
humour
about
it
though
he
still
felt
no
serious
doubt
about
the
result
of
this
interview
i
m
afraid
perhaps
then
that
i
did
not
take
your
letter
quite
seriously
my
dear
michael
he
said
in
the
bantering
tone
that
froze
michael
s
cordiality
completely
up
i
glanced
through
it
i
saw
a
lot
of
nonsense
or
so
it
struck
me
about
your
resigning
your
commission
and
studying
music
i
think
you
mentioned
baireuth
and
settling
down
in
london
yes
i
said
all
that
said
michael
but
you
make
a
mistake
if
you
do
not
see
that
it
was
written
his
father
glanced
across
at
him
where
he
sat
with
his
heavy
plain
face
his
long
arms
and
short
legs
and
the
sight
merely
irritated
him
with
his
passion
for
convention
and
one
of
the
most
important
conventions
was
that
combers
should
be
fine
strapping
normal
people
he
hated
the
thought
that
it
was
his
son
who
presented
that
appearance
and
his
son
s
mind
seemed
to
him
at
this
moment
as
ungainly
as
his
person
again
very
unwisely
he
laughed
still
thinking
to
carry
this
off
by
the
high
hand
yes
but
i
can
t
take
that
rubbish
seriously
he
said
i
am
asking
your
permission
now
to
inquire
without
any
nonsense
into
what
you
michael
frowned
he
felt
the
insincerity
of
his
father
s
laugh
and
rebelled
against
the
unfairness
of
it
the
question
he
knew
well
was
sarcastically
asked
the
flavour
of
irony
in
the
permission
to
inquire
was
not
there
by
accident
to
speak
like
that
implied
contempt
of
his
opposition
he
felt
that
he
was
being
treated
like
a
child
over
some
nursery
rebellion
in
which
subsequently
there
is
no
real
possibility
of
disobedience
he
felt
his
anger
rising
in
spite
of
himself
if
you
refer
to
it
as
rubbish
sir
there
is
the
end
of
the
ah
i
thought
we
should
soon
agree
said
lord
ashbridge
chuckling
you
mistake
me
said
michael
there
is
the
end
of
the
matter
because
i
won
t
discuss
it
any
more
if
you
treat
me
like
this
i
will
say
good
night
if
you
intend
to
persist
in
the
idea
that
you
can
just
brush
my
resolves
away
like
this
clearly
took
his
father
aback
it
was
a
perfectly
dignified
and
proper
attitude
to
take
in
the
face
of
ridicule
and
lord
ashbridge
though
somewhat
an
adept
at
the
art
of
as
for
instance
when
he
habitually
beat
the
golf
professional
could
not
disguise
from
himself
that
his
policy
had
been
to
laugh
and
blow
away
michael
s
absurd
ideas
but
it
was
abundantly
clear
at
this
moment
that
this
apparently
easy
operation
was
out
of
his
reach
he
got
up
with
more
amenity
in
his
manner
than
he
had
yet
shown
and
laid
his
hand
on
michael
s
shoulder
as
he
stood
in
front
of
him
evidently
quite
prepared
to
go
away
come
my
dear
michael
this
won
t
do
he
said
i
thought
it
best
to
treat
your
absurd
schemes
with
a
certain
lightness
and
i
have
only
succeeded
in
irritating
michael
was
perfectly
aware
that
he
had
scored
and
as
his
object
was
to
score
he
made
another
criticism
when
you
say
absurd
schemes
sir
he
said
with
quiet
respect
are
you
not
still
laughing
at
them
lord
ashbridge
again
retreated
strategically
very
well
i
withdraw
absurd
he
said
now
sit
down
again
and
we
will
talk
tell
me
what
is
in
your
michael
made
a
great
effort
with
himself
he
desired
in
the
secret
real
michael
to
be
reasonable
and
cordial
to
behave
filially
while
all
the
time
his
nerves
were
on
edge
with
his
father
s
ridicule
and
with
his
instinctive
knowledge
of
his
father
s
distaste
for
him
well
it
s
like
this
father
he
said
i
m
doing
no
good
as
i
am
i
went
into
the
guards
as
you
know
because
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
a
business
man
s
son
is
put
into
business
for
the
same
reason
and
i
m
not
good
at
michael
paused
a
moment
my
heart
isn
t
in
it
he
said
and
i
dislike
it
it
seems
to
me
useless
we
re
for
show
and
my
heart
is
quite
entirely
in
music
it
s
the
thing
i
care
for
more
than
anything
again
he
paused
all
that
came
so
easily
to
his
tongue
when
he
was
speaking
to
francis
was
congealed
now
when
he
felt
the
contempt
with
which
though
unexpressed
he
knew
he
inspired
his
father
lord
ashbridge
waited
with
careful
politeness
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ceiling
his
large
person
completely
filling
his
chair
just
as
his
atmosphere
filled
the
room
he
said
nothing
at
all
until
the
silence
rang
in
michael
s
ears
that
is
all
i
can
tell
you
he
said
at
length
lord
ashbridge
carefully
conveyed
the
ash
from
his
cigarette
to
the
fireplace
before
he
spoke
he
felt
that
the
time
had
come
for
his
most
impressive
effort
very
well
then
listen
to
me
he
said
what
you
suffer
from
michael
is
a
mere
want
of
and
from
modesty
you
don
t
seem
to
grasp
i
have
often
noticed
this
who
you
are
and
what
your
importance
is
an
importance
which
everybody
is
willing
to
recognise
if
you
will
only
assume
it
you
have
the
privileges
of
your
position
which
you
don
t
sufficiently
value
but
you
have
also
the
responsibilities
of
it
which
i
am
afraid
you
are
inclined
to
shirk
you
haven
t
got
the
large
view
you
haven
t
the
sense
of
patriotism
there
are
a
great
many
things
in
my
position
the
position
into
which
you
will
step
which
i
would
much
sooner
be
without
but
we
have
received
a
tradition
and
we
are
bound
to
hand
it
on
intact
you
may
think
that
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
being
in
the
guards
but
it
has
we
and
he
seemed
to
swell
a
little
we
are
bound
in
honour
to
take
the
lead
in
the
service
of
our
country
and
we
must
do
it
whether
we
like
it
or
not
we
have
to
till
with
our
own
efforts
our
goodly
you
have
to
learn
the
meaning
of
such
words
as
patriotism
and
caste
and
lord
ashbridge
thought
that
he
was
really
putting
this
very
well
indeed
and
he
had
the
sustaining
consciousness
of
sincerity
he
entirely
believed
what
he
said
and
felt
that
it
must
carry
conviction
to
anyone
who
listened
to
it
with
anything
like
an
open
mind
the
only
thing
that
he
did
not
allow
for
was
that
he
personally
immensely
enjoyed
his
social
and
dominant
position
thinking
it
indeed
the
only
position
which
was
really
worth
having
this
naturally
gave
an
aid
to
comprehension
and
he
did
not
take
into
account
that
michael
was
not
so
blessed
as
he
and
indeed
lacked
this
very
superior
individual
enlightenment
but
his
own
words
kindled
the
flame
of
this
illumination
and
without
noticing
the
blank
stolidity
of
michael
s
face
he
went
on
with
gathering
confidence
i
am
sure
you
are
my
dear
michael
he
said
and
it
is
to
your
that
i
yes
i
don
t
mind
saying
it
that
i
appeal
in
a
moment
of
unreflectiveness
you
have
thrown
overboard
what
i
am
sure
is
real
to
you
the
sense
broadly
speaking
that
you
are
english
and
of
the
highest
english
class
and
have
intended
to
devote
yourself
to
more
selfish
and
aims
and
to
dwell
in
a
tinkle
of
pleasant
sounds
that
please
your
ear
and
i
m
sure
i
don
t
wonder
because
as
your
mother
and
i
both
know
you
play
charmingly
but
i
feel
confident
that
your
better
mind
does
not
really
confuse
the
mere
diversions
of
life
with
its
serious
michael
suddenly
rose
to
his
feet
father
i
m
afraid
this
is
no
use
at
all
he
said
all
that
i
feel
and
all
that
i
can
t
say
i
know
is
unintelligible
to
you
you
have
called
it
rubbish
once
and
you
think
it
is
rubbish
lord
ashbridge
s
eloquence
was
suddenly
arrested
he
had
been
cantering
gleefully
along
and
had
the
very
distinct
impression
of
having
run
up
against
a
stone
wall
he
dismounted
hurt
but
in
no
way
broken
i
am
anxious
to
understand
you
michael
he
said
yes
father
but
you
don
t
said
he
you
have
been
explaining
me
all
wrong
for
instance
i
don
t
regard
music
as
a
diversion
that
is
the
only
explanation
there
is
of
and
as
regards
my
wishes
and
my
authority
asked
his
father
michael
squared
his
shoulders
and
his
mind
i
am
exceedingly
sorry
to
disappoint
you
in
the
matter
of
your
wishes
he
said
but
in
the
matter
of
your
authority
i
can
t
recognise
it
when
the
question
of
my
whole
life
is
at
stake
i
know
that
i
am
your
son
and
i
want
to
be
dutiful
but
i
have
my
own
individuality
as
well
that
only
recognises
the
authority
of
my
own
that
seemed
to
lord
ashbridge
both
tragic
and
ludicrous
completely
subservient
himself
to
the
conventions
which
he
so
much
enjoyed
it
was
like
the
defiance
of
a
child
to
say
such
things
he
only
just
checked
himself
from
laughing
again
i
refuse
to
take
that
answer
from
you
he
said
i
have
no
other
to
give
you
said
michael
but
i
should
like
to
say
once
more
that
i
am
sorry
to
disobey
your
the
repetition
took
away
his
desire
to
laugh
in
fact
he
could
not
have
laughed
i
don
t
want
to
threaten
you
michael
he
said
but
you
may
know
that
i
have
a
very
free
hand
in
the
disposal
of
my
is
that
a
threat
asked
michael
it
is
a
then
father
i
can
only
say
that
i
should
be
perfectly
satisfied
with
anything
you
may
do
said
michael
i
wish
you
could
leave
everything
you
have
to
francis
i
tell
you
in
all
sincerity
that
i
wish
he
had
been
my
elder
brother
you
would
have
been
far
better
pleased
with
lord
ashbridge
s
anger
rose
he
was
naturally
so
as
to
be
seldom
disposed
to
anger
but
its
rarity
was
not
due
to
kindliness
of
nature
i
have
before
now
noticed
your
jealousy
of
your
cousin
he
observed
michael
s
face
went
white
that
is
infamous
and
untrue
father
he
said
lord
ashbridge
turned
on
him
apologise
for
that
he
said
michael
looked
up
at
his
high
towering
without
a
tremor
i
wait
for
the
withdrawal
of
your
accusation
that
i
am
jealous
of
francis
he
replied
there
was
a
dead
silence
lord
ashbridge
stood
there
in
swollen
and
speechless
indignation
and
michael
faced
him
undismayed
and
then
suddenly
to
the
boy
there
came
an
impulse
of
pure
pity
for
his
father
s
disappointment
in
having
a
son
like
himself
he
saw
with
the
candour
which
was
so
real
a
part
of
him
how
hopeless
it
must
be
to
a
man
of
his
father
s
mind
to
have
a
millstone
like
himself
unalterably
bound
round
his
neck
fit
to
choke
and
drown
him
indeed
i
am
not
jealous
of
francis
father
he
said
and
i
speak
quite
truthfully
when
i
say
how
i
sympathise
with
you
in
having
a
son
like
me
i
don
t
want
to
vex
you
i
want
to
make
the
best
of
lord
ashbridge
stood
looking
exactly
like
his
statue
in
the
at
ashbridge
if
that
is
the
case
michael
he
said
it
is
within
your
power
you
will
write
the
letter
i
spoke
michael
paused
a
moment
as
if
waiting
for
more
it
did
not
seem
to
him
possible
that
his
appeal
should
bear
no
further
fruit
than
that
but
it
was
soon
clear
that
there
was
no
more
to
come
i
will
wish
you
good
night
father
he
said
sunday
was
a
day
on
which
lord
ashbridge
was
almost
more
himself
than
during
the
week
so
shining
and
public
an
example
did
he
become
of
the
british
nobleman
instead
of
having
breakfast
according
to
the
custom
rather
later
than
usual
that
solid
sausagy
meal
was
half
an
hour
earlier
so
that
all
the
servants
except
those
whose
presence
in
the
house
was
imperatively
necessary
for
purposes
of
lunch
should
go
to
church
thus
old
george
and
lord
ashbridge
s
private
boat
were
exceedingly
busy
for
the
preceding
church
time
the
last
holding
the
family
whose
arrival
was
the
signal
for
service
to
begin
lady
ashbridge
however
always
went
on
earlier
for
she
presided
at
the
organ
with
the
long
back
turned
towards
the
congregation
and
started
playing
a
slow
melancholy
voluntary
when
the
boy
who
blew
the
bellows
said
to
her
in
an
ecclesiastical
whisper
his
lordship
has
arrived
my
those
of
the
household
who
could
sing
singing
being
construed
in
the
sense
of
making
a
loud
and
cheerful
noise
in
the
throat
clustered
in
the
near
the
organ
while
the
family
sat
in
a
large
square
box
with
a
stove
in
the
centre
amply
supplied
with
of
the
time
when
even
protestants
might
pray
for
queen
caroline
behind
them
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
church
by
an
ornamental
ironwork
grille
was
the
comber
chapel
in
which
antiquarians
took
nearly
as
much
pleasure
as
lord
ashbridge
himself
here
reclined
a
glorious
company
of
sixteenth
century
knights
with
their
honourable
ladies
at
their
sides
unyielding
marble
bolsters
at
their
heads
and
grotesque
dogs
at
their
feet
later
when
their
peerage
was
conferred
they
lost
a
little
of
their
yeoman
simplicity
and
became
peruked
and
robed
and
breeched
one
indeed
in
the
age
of
george
who
was
blessed
with
poetical
aspirations
appeared
in
bare
feet
and
a
roman
toga
with
a
scroll
of
manuscript
in
his
hand
while
later
again
mere
tablets
on
the
walls
commemorated
their
almost
uncanny
virtues
and
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
grille
but
a
step
away
sat
the
representatives
of
the
line
while
lady
ashbridge
finished
the
last
bars
of
her
voluntary
lord
ashbridge
himself
and
his
sister
large
and
smart
and
comely
and
michael
beside
them
short
and
heavy
with
his
soul
full
of
the
aspirations
his
father
neither
could
nor
cared
to
understand
according
to
his
invariable
custom
lord
ashbridge
read
the
lessons
in
a
loud
sonorous
voice
his
large
white
hands
grasping
the
of
the
brass
eagle
and
a
great
carnation
in
his
buttonhole
and
when
the
time
came
for
the
offertory
he
put
a
sovereign
in
the
open
plate
himself
and
proceeded
with
his
step
to
go
round
the
church
and
collect
the
gifts
of
the
encouraged
congregation
he
followed
all
the
prayers
in
his
book
he
made
the
responses
in
a
voice
nearly
as
loud
as
that
in
which
he
read
the
lessons
he
sang
the
hymns
with
a
curious
buzzing
sound
and
never
for
a
moment
did
he
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
he
was
the
head
of
the
comber
family
doing
his
duty
as
the
custom
of
the
combers
was
and
setting
an
example
of
godly
piety
afterwards
as
usual
he
would
change
his
black
coat
eat
a
good
lunch
stroll
round
the
gardens
for
he
had
nothing
to
say
to
golf
on
sunday
and
in
the
evening
the
clergyman
would
dine
with
him
and
would
be
requested
to
say
grace
both
before
and
after
the
meal
he
knew
exactly
the
proper
mode
of
passing
the
sunday
for
the
landlord
on
his
country
estate
and
when
lord
ashbridge
knew
that
a
thing
was
proper
he
did
it
with
invariable
precision
michael
of
course
was
in
disgrace
his
father
pending
some
further
course
of
action
neither
spoke
to
him
nor
looked
at
him
indeed
it
seemed
doubtful
whether
he
would
hand
him
the
offertory
plate
and
it
was
perhaps
a
pity
that
he
unbent
even
to
this
extent
for
michael
happened
to
have
none
of
the
symbols
of
thankfulness
about
his
person
and
he
saw
a
slight
quiver
pass
through
aunt
barbara
s
after
a
rather
portentous
lunch
however
there
came
some
relief
for
his
father
did
not
ask
his
company
on
the
usual
sunday
afternoon
stroll
and
aunt
barbara
never
walked
at
all
unless
she
was
obliged
in
consequence
when
the
thunderstorm
had
stepped
airily
away
across
the
park
michael
joined
her
on
the
terrace
with
the
intention
of
talking
the
situation
over
with
her
aunt
barbara
was
perfectly
willing
to
do
this
and
she
opened
the
discussion
very
pleasantly
with
peals
of
laughter
my
dear
i
delight
in
you
she
said
and
altogether
this
is
the
most
entertaining
day
i
have
ever
spent
here
combers
are
supposed
to
be
very
serious
solid
people
but
for
unconscious
humour
there
isn
t
a
family
in
england
or
even
in
the
states
to
compare
with
them
our
lunch
just
now
if
you
could
put
it
into
a
satirical
comedy
called
the
aristocracy
it
would
make
the
fortune
of
any
a
dawning
smile
began
to
break
through
michael
s
tragedy
face
i
suppose
it
was
rather
funny
he
said
but
really
i
m
wretched
about
it
aunt
my
dear
what
is
there
to
be
wretched
about
you
might
have
been
wretched
if
you
had
found
you
couldn
t
stand
up
to
your
father
but
i
gather
though
i
know
nothing
directly
that
you
did
at
least
your
mother
has
said
to
me
three
times
twice
on
the
way
to
church
and
once
coming
back
michael
has
vexed
his
father
very
and
the
offertory
plate
my
dear
and
as
i
was
saying
lunch
i
am
in
disgrace
too
because
i
said
perfectly
plainly
yesterday
that
i
was
on
your
side
and
there
we
were
at
lunch
with
your
father
apparently
unable
to
see
either
you
or
me
and
unconscious
of
our
presence
fancy
pretending
not
to
see
me
you
can
t
help
seeing
me
a
large
bright
object
like
me
and
what
will
happen
next
that
s
what
tickles
me
to
death
as
they
say
on
my
side
of
the
atlantic
will
he
gradually
begin
to
perceive
us
again
like
objects
looming
through
a
fog
or
shall
we
come
into
view
suddenly
as
if
going
round
a
corner
and
you
are
just
as
funny
my
dear
with
your
long
face
and
air
of
depressed
determination
why
be
heavy
michael
so
many
people
are
heavy
and
none
of
them
can
tell
you
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
the
unfreezing
effect
of
this
michael
thawed
to
it
as
he
would
have
thawed
to
francis
perhaps
they
can
t
help
it
aunt
barbara
he
said
at
least
i
know
i
can
t
i
really
wish
i
could
learn
how
to
i
i
don
t
see
the
funny
side
of
things
till
it
is
pointed
out
i
thought
lunch
a
sort
of
hell
you
know
of
course
it
was
funny
his
appearing
not
to
see
either
of
us
but
it
stands
for
more
than
that
it
stands
for
his
complete
misunderstanding
of
aunt
barbara
had
the
sense
to
see
that
the
real
michael
was
speaking
when
people
were
being
unreal
when
they
were
pompous
or
adopting
attitudes
she
could
attend
to
nothing
but
their
absurdity
which
engrossed
her
altogether
but
she
never
laughed
at
real
things
real
things
were
not
funny
but
were
facts
he
quite
misunderstands
went
on
michael
with
the
eagerness
with
which
the
shy
welcome
comprehension
he
thinks
i
can
make
my
mind
like
his
if
i
choose
and
if
i
don
t
choose
or
rather
can
t
choose
he
thinks
that
his
wishes
his
authority
should
be
sufficient
to
make
me
act
as
if
it
was
well
i
won
t
do
that
he
may
go
on
and
that
pleasant
smile
lit
up
michael
s
plain
face
he
may
go
on
being
unaware
of
my
presence
as
long
as
he
pleases
i
am
very
sorry
it
should
be
so
but
i
can
t
help
it
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
opposition
of
that
sort
his
sort
makes
me
more
determined
than
aunt
barbara
nodded
and
your
friends
she
asked
what
will
they
think
michael
looked
at
her
quite
simply
and
directly
friends
he
said
i
haven
t
got
ah
my
dear
that
s
nonsense
she
said
i
wish
it
was
oh
francis
is
a
friend
i
know
he
thinks
me
an
odd
old
thing
but
he
likes
me
other
people
don
t
and
i
can
t
see
why
they
should
i
m
sure
it
s
my
fault
it
s
because
i
m
heavy
you
said
i
was
then
i
was
a
great
ass
remarked
aunt
barbara
you
wouldn
t
be
heavy
with
people
who
understood
you
you
aren
t
heavy
with
me
for
instance
but
my
dear
lead
isn
t
in
it
when
you
are
with
your
but
what
am
i
to
do
if
i
m
like
that
asked
the
boy
she
held
up
her
large
fat
hand
and
marked
the
points
off
on
her
fingers
three
things
she
said
firstly
get
away
from
people
who
don
t
understand
you
and
whom
incidentally
you
don
t
understand
secondly
try
to
see
how
ridiculous
you
and
everybody
else
always
are
and
thirdly
which
is
much
the
most
important
don
t
think
about
yourself
if
i
thought
about
myself
i
should
consider
how
old
and
fat
and
ugly
i
am
i
m
not
ugly
really
you
needn
t
be
foolish
and
tell
me
so
i
should
spoil
my
life
by
trying
to
be
young
and
only
eating
devilled
codfish
and
drinking
hot
or
whatever
is
the
accepted
remedy
for
what
we
call
obesity
we
re
all
odd
old
things
as
you
say
we
can
only
get
away
from
that
depressing
fact
by
doing
something
and
not
thinking
about
ourselves
we
can
all
try
not
to
be
egoists
egoism
is
the
really
heavy
quality
in
the
she
paused
a
moment
in
this
inspired
discourse
and
whistled
to
og
who
had
stretched
his
weary
limbs
across
a
bed
of
particularly
fine
geraniums
there
she
said
pointing
if
your
dog
had
done
that
you
would
be
submerged
in
depression
at
the
thought
of
how
vexed
your
father
would
be
that
would
be
because
you
are
thinking
of
the
effect
on
yourself
as
it
s
my
dog
that
has
done
it
dear
me
they
do
look
squashed
now
he
has
got
up
you
don
t
really
mind
about
your
father
s
vexation
because
you
won
t
have
to
think
about
yourself
that
is
wise
of
you
if
you
were
a
little
wiser
still
you
would
picture
to
yourself
how
ridiculous
i
shall
look
apologising
for
og
kindly
kick
him
michael
he
will
understand
naughty
and
as
for
your
not
having
any
friends
that
would
be
exceedingly
sad
if
you
had
gone
the
right
way
to
get
them
and
failed
but
you
haven
t
you
haven
t
even
gone
among
the
people
who
could
be
your
friends
your
friends
broadly
speaking
must
like
the
same
sort
of
things
as
you
there
must
be
a
common
basis
you
can
t
even
argue
with
somebody
or
disagree
with
somebody
unless
you
have
a
common
ground
to
start
from
if
i
say
that
black
is
white
and
you
think
it
is
blue
we
can
t
get
on
it
leads
nowhere
and
finally
she
turned
round
and
faced
him
directly
finally
don
t
be
so
cross
my
dear
she
said
but
am
i
asked
he
yes
you
don
t
know
it
or
else
probably
since
you
are
a
very
decent
fellow
you
wouldn
t
be
you
expect
not
to
be
liked
and
that
is
cross
of
you
a
person
expects
to
be
liked
and
almost
always
is
you
expect
not
to
be
understood
and
that
s
dreadfully
cross
you
think
your
father
doesn
t
understand
you
no
more
he
does
but
don
t
go
on
thinking
about
it
you
think
it
is
a
great
bore
to
be
your
father
s
only
son
and
wish
francis
was
instead
that
s
cross
you
may
think
it
s
fine
but
it
isn
t
and
it
is
also
ungrateful
you
can
have
great
fun
if
you
will
only
be
how
did
you
know
that
about
francis
i
mean
asked
michael
does
it
happen
to
be
true
of
course
it
does
every
cross
young
man
wishes
he
was
somebody
no
not
quite
that
began
michael
don
t
interrupt
it
is
sufficiently
accurate
and
you
think
about
your
appearance
my
dear
it
will
do
quite
well
you
might
have
had
two
noses
or
only
one
eye
whereas
you
have
two
rather
jolly
ones
and
do
try
to
see
the
joke
in
other
people
michael
you
didn
t
see
the
joke
in
your
interview
last
night
with
your
father
it
must
have
been
excruciatingly
funny
i
don
t
say
it
wasn
t
sad
and
serious
as
well
but
it
was
funny
too
there
were
michael
shook
his
head
i
didn
t
see
them
he
said
but
i
should
have
and
i
should
have
been
right
all
dignity
is
funny
simply
because
it
is
sham
when
dignity
is
real
you
don
t
know
it
s
dignity
but
your
father
knew
he
was
being
dignified
and
you
knew
you
were
being
dignified
my
dear
what
a
pair
of
you
michael
frowned
but
is
nothing
serious
then
he
asked
surely
it
was
serious
enough
last
night
there
was
i
in
rank
rebellion
to
my
father
and
it
vexed
him
horribly
it
did
more
it
grieved
she
laid
her
hand
on
michael
s
knee
as
if
i
didn
t
know
that
she
said
we
re
all
sorry
for
that
though
i
should
have
been
much
sorrier
if
you
had
given
in
and
ceased
to
vex
him
but
there
it
is
accept
that
and
then
my
dear
swiftly
apply
yourself
to
perceive
the
humour
of
it
and
now
about
your
plans
i
shall
go
to
baireuth
on
wednesday
and
then
on
to
munich
began
michael
that
of
course
perhaps
you
may
find
the
humour
of
a
channel
crossing
i
look
for
it
in
vain
yet
i
don
t
know
the
man
who
puts
on
a
and
asks
if
there
s
a
bit
of
a
sea
on
it
proves
to
be
the
case
and
he
is
excessively
unwell
i
must
look
out
for
him
next
time
i
cross
and
then
then
i
shall
settle
in
town
and
study
oh
here
s
my
father
coming
lord
ashbridge
approached
down
the
terrace
he
stopped
for
a
moment
at
the
desecrated
geranium
bed
saw
the
two
sitting
together
and
turned
at
right
angles
and
went
into
the
house
almost
immediately
a
footman
came
out
with
a
long
and
advanced
hesitatingly
to
og
og
was
convinced
that
he
had
come
to
play
with
him
and
crouched
and
growled
and
retreated
and
advanced
with
engaging
affability
out
of
the
windows
of
the
library
looked
lord
ashbridge
s
baleful
face
aunt
barbara
swayed
out
of
her
chair
and
laid
a
trembling
hand
on
michael
s
shoulder
i
shall
go
and
apologise
for
og
she
said
i
shall
do
it
quite
sincerely
my
dear
but
there
are
chapter
iv
michael
practised
a
certain
mature
and
rather
elderly
precision
in
the
ordinary
affairs
of
daily
life
his
habits
were
almost
unduly
tidy
and
punctual
he
answered
letters
by
return
of
post
he
never
mislaid
things
nor
tore
up
documents
which
he
particularly
desired
should
be
preserved
he
kept
his
gold
in
a
purse
and
his
change
in
a
and
in
matters
of
travelling
he
always
arrived
at
stations
with
plenty
of
time
to
spare
and
had
such
creature
comforts
as
he
desired
for
his
journey
in
a
neat
gladstone
bag
above
his
head
he
never
travelled
for
the
very
simple
and
adequate
reason
that
though
very
well
off
he
preferred
to
spend
his
money
in
ways
that
were
more
productive
of
usefulness
or
pleasure
and
thus
when
he
took
his
place
in
the
corner
of
a
compartment
of
the
express
on
the
wednesday
morning
following
he
was
the
only
occupant
of
it
probably
he
had
never
felt
so
fully
at
liberty
nor
enjoyed
a
keener
zest
for
life
and
the
future
for
the
first
time
he
had
asserted
his
own
indisputable
right
to
stand
on
his
own
feet
and
though
he
was
genuinely
sorry
for
his
father
s
chagrin
at
not
being
able
to
tuck
him
up
in
the
family
coach
his
own
sense
of
independence
could
not
but
wave
its
banners
there
had
been
a
second
interview
no
less
fruitless
than
the
first
and
lord
ashbridge
had
told
him
that
when
next
his
presence
was
desired
at
home
he
would
be
informed
of
the
fact
his
mother
had
cried
in
a
mild
trickling
fashion
but
it
was
quite
obvious
that
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
was
more
concerned
with
a
bilious
attack
of
peculiar
intensity
that
had
assailed
petsy
she
wished
michael
would
not
be
so
disobedient
and
vex
his
father
but
she
was
quite
sure
that
before
long
some
formula
in
diplomatic
phrase
would
be
found
on
which
reconciliation
could
be
based
whereas
it
was
highly
uncertain
whether
any
formula
could
be
found
that
would
produce
the
desired
effect
on
petsy
whose
illness
she
attributed
to
the
shock
of
og
s
sudden
and
disconcerting
appearance
on
saturday
when
all
petsy
s
nervous
force
was
required
to
digest
the
copious
cream
consequently
though
she
threw
reproachful
glances
at
michael
those
directed
at
barbara
who
was
the
cause
of
the
acuter
tragedy
were
pointed
with
more
penetrating
blame
indeed
it
is
questionable
whether
lady
ashbridge
would
have
cried
at
all
over
michael
s
affairs
had
not
petsy
s
also
been
in
so
lamentable
and
critical
a
state
just
as
the
train
began
to
move
out
of
the
station
a
young
man
rushed
across
the
platform
eluded
the
embrace
of
the
guard
who
attempted
to
stop
him
with
amazing
agility
and
jumped
into
michael
s
compartment
he
slammed
the
door
after
him
and
leaned
out
apparently
looking
for
someone
whom
he
soon
saw
just
caught
it
sylvia
he
shouted
send
on
my
luggage
will
you
it
s
in
the
taxi
still
i
think
and
i
haven
t
paid
the
man
he
waved
to
her
till
the
curving
line
took
the
platform
out
of
sight
and
then
sat
down
with
a
laugh
and
eyes
of
friendly
interest
for
michael
narrow
squeak
wasn
t
it
he
said
gleefully
i
thought
the
guard
had
collared
me
and
i
should
have
missed
michael
had
recognised
him
at
once
as
he
rushed
across
the
platform
his
shouting
to
sylvia
had
but
confirmed
the
recognition
and
here
on
the
day
of
his
entering
into
his
new
kingdom
of
liberty
was
one
of
its
citizens
almost
thrown
into
his
arms
but
for
the
moment
his
old
invincible
habit
of
shyness
and
sensitiveness
forbade
any
responsive
lightness
of
welcome
and
he
was
merely
formal
merely
courteous
and
all
your
luggage
left
behind
he
said
won
t
you
be
dreadfully
uncomfortable
uncomfortable
why
asked
falbe
i
shall
buy
a
handkerchief
and
a
collar
every
day
and
a
shirt
and
a
pair
of
socks
every
other
day
till
it
michael
felt
a
sudden
daring
impulse
he
remembered
aunt
barbara
s
salutary
remarks
about
crossness
being
the
equivalent
of
thinking
about
oneself
and
the
effort
that
it
cost
him
may
be
taken
as
the
measure
of
his
solitary
disposition
but
you
needn
t
do
that
he
said
if
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
borrow
of
me
till
your
things
he
blurted
it
out
awkwardly
almost
brusquely
and
falbe
looked
slightly
amused
at
this
wholly
surprising
offer
of
hospitality
but
that
s
awfully
good
of
you
he
said
laughing
and
saying
nothing
direct
about
his
acceptance
it
implies
too
that
you
are
going
to
baireuth
we
travel
together
then
i
hope
for
it
is
dismal
work
travelling
alone
isn
t
it
my
sister
tells
me
that
half
my
friends
were
picked
up
in
railway
carriages
been
there
before
michael
felt
himself
lured
from
the
ordinary
aloofness
of
attitude
and
demeanour
which
had
been
somewhat
accustomed
to
view
all
strangers
with
suspicion
and
yet
though
till
this
moment
he
had
never
spoken
to
him
he
could
hardly
regard
falbe
as
a
stranger
for
he
had
heard
him
say
on
the
piano
what
his
sister
understood
by
the
songs
of
brahms
and
schubert
he
could
not
help
glancing
at
falbe
s
hands
as
they
busied
themselves
with
the
filling
and
lighting
of
a
pipe
and
felt
that
he
knew
something
of
those
long
fingers
smooth
and
white
and
strong
the
man
himself
he
found
to
be
quite
different
to
what
he
had
expected
he
had
seen
him
before
eager
and
intent
and
absorbed
in
the
task
of
following
another
mind
now
he
looked
much
younger
much
more
boyish
no
it
s
my
first
visit
to
baireuth
he
said
and
i
can
t
tell
you
how
excited
i
am
about
it
i
ve
been
looking
forward
to
it
so
much
that
i
almost
expect
to
be
falbe
blew
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
laughter
oh
you
re
safe
enough
he
said
baireuth
never
disappoints
it
s
one
of
the
facts
a
reliable
fact
and
munich
do
you
go
to
munich
afterwards
yes
i
hope
falbe
clicked
with
his
tongue
lucky
fellow
he
said
how
i
wish
i
was
but
i
ve
got
to
get
back
again
after
my
week
you
ll
spend
the
mornings
in
the
galleries
and
the
afternoons
and
evenings
at
the
opera
o
lord
munich
he
came
across
from
the
other
side
of
the
carriage
and
sat
next
michael
putting
his
feet
up
on
the
seat
opposite
talk
of
munich
he
said
i
was
born
in
munich
and
i
happen
to
know
that
it
s
the
heavenly
jerusalem
neither
more
nor
well
the
heavenly
jerusalem
is
practically
next
door
to
baireuth
said
michael
i
know
but
it
can
t
be
managed
however
there
s
a
week
of
unalloyed
bliss
between
me
now
and
the
desolation
of
london
in
august
what
is
so
maddening
is
to
think
of
all
the
people
who
could
go
to
munich
and
don
michael
held
debate
within
himself
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
tell
his
new
acquaintance
that
he
knew
who
he
was
that
however
trivial
their
conversation
might
be
it
somehow
resembled
eavesdropping
to
talk
to
a
chance
as
if
he
were
a
complete
stranger
but
it
required
again
a
certain
effort
to
make
the
announcement
i
think
i
had
better
tell
you
he
said
at
length
that
i
know
you
that
i
ve
listened
to
you
at
least
at
your
sister
s
recital
a
few
days
falbe
turned
to
him
with
the
friendliest
pleasure
ah
were
you
there
he
asked
i
hope
you
listened
to
her
then
not
to
me
she
sang
well
didn
t
she
but
divinely
at
the
same
time
i
did
listen
to
you
especially
in
the
french
songs
there
was
less
song
you
falbe
laughed
and
more
accompaniment
he
said
perhaps
you
play
michael
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
shyness
at
the
idea
of
talking
to
falbe
about
himself
oh
i
just
strum
he
said
throughout
the
journey
their
acquaintanceship
ripened
and
casually
in
dropped
remarks
the
two
began
to
learn
something
about
each
other
falbe
s
command
of
english
as
well
as
his
sister
s
which
was
so
complete
that
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
a
foreigner
was
speaking
was
explained
for
it
came
out
that
his
mother
was
english
and
that
from
infancy
they
had
spoken
german
and
english
indiscriminately
his
father
who
had
died
some
dozen
years
before
had
been
a
singer
of
some
note
in
his
native
land
but
was
distinguished
more
for
his
teaching
than
his
practice
and
it
was
he
who
had
taught
his
daughter
hermann
falbe
himself
had
always
intended
to
be
a
pianist
but
the
poverty
in
which
they
were
left
at
his
father
s
death
had
obliged
him
to
give
lessons
rather
than
devote
himself
to
his
own
career
but
now
at
the
age
of
thirty
he
found
himself
within
sight
of
the
competence
that
would
allow
him
to
cut
down
his
pupils
and
begin
to
be
a
pupil
again
himself
his
sister
moreover
for
whom
he
had
slaved
for
years
in
order
that
she
might
continue
her
own
singing
education
unchecked
was
now
more
than
able
especially
after
these
last
three
months
in
london
where
she
had
suddenly
leaped
into
eminence
to
support
herself
and
contributed
to
the
expenses
of
their
common
home
but
there
was
still
so
michael
gathered
no
great
superabundance
of
money
and
he
guessed
that
falbe
s
inability
to
go
to
munich
was
due
to
the
question
of
expense
all
this
came
out
by
inference
and
allusion
rather
than
by
direct
information
while
michael
naturally
reticent
and
feeling
that
his
own
uneventful
affairs
could
have
no
interest
for
anybody
was
less
communicative
and
indeed
while
shunning
the
appearance
of
inquisitiveness
he
was
far
too
eager
to
get
hold
of
his
new
acquaintance
to
think
of
volunteering
much
himself
here
to
him
was
this
citizen
of
the
new
country
who
all
his
life
had
lived
in
the
palace
of
art
and
that
in
no
dilettante
fashion
but
with
set
aim
and
serious
purpose
and
falbe
abounded
in
such
topics
he
knew
the
singers
and
the
musicians
of
the
world
and
which
was
much
more
than
that
he
was
himself
of
them
humble
no
doubt
in
circumstances
and
achievement
as
yet
but
clearly
to
michael
of
the
blood
royal
of
artistry
that
was
the
essential
thing
about
him
as
regards
his
relations
with
his
though
when
next
morning
the
spires
of
cologne
and
the
swift
river
of
his
fatherland
came
into
sight
he
burst
out
into
a
sort
of
rhapsody
of
patriotism
that
mockingly
covered
a
great
sincerity
ah
beloved
land
he
cried
soil
of
heaven
and
of
divine
harmony
hail
to
thee
hail
to
thee
rhine
rhine
deep
and
true
and
and
he
waved
his
hat
and
sang
the
greeting
of
brunnhilde
then
he
turned
laughingly
to
michael
i
am
sufficiently
english
to
know
how
ridiculous
that
must
seem
to
you
he
said
for
i
love
england
also
and
the
passengers
on
the
boat
would
merely
think
me
mad
if
i
apostrophised
the
cliffs
of
dover
and
the
mud
of
the
english
roads
but
here
i
am
a
german
again
and
i
would
willingly
kiss
the
soil
you
english
we
english
i
may
say
for
i
am
as
much
english
as
german
i
believe
have
got
the
same
feeling
somewhere
in
our
hearts
but
we
lock
it
up
and
hide
it
away
pray
god
i
shall
never
have
to
choose
to
which
nation
i
belong
though
for
that
matter
there
in
no
choice
in
it
at
all
for
i
am
certainly
a
german
subject
guten
tag
koln
let
us
instantly
have
our
coffee
there
is
no
coffee
like
german
coffee
though
the
french
coffee
is
undeniably
pleasanter
to
the
mere
superficial
palate
but
it
doesn
t
touch
the
heart
as
everything
german
touches
my
heart
when
i
come
back
to
the
he
chattered
on
in
tremendous
high
spirits
and
to
think
that
we
shall
sleep
in
true
german
beds
he
said
i
allow
that
the
duvet
is
not
so
convenient
as
blankets
and
that
there
is
a
watershed
always
up
the
middle
of
your
bed
so
that
during
the
night
your
person
descends
to
one
side
while
the
duvet
rolls
down
the
other
but
it
is
german
which
makes
up
for
any
trifling
inconvenience
baireuth
too
perhaps
it
will
strike
you
as
a
dull
and
stinking
little
town
and
so
i
dare
say
it
is
but
after
lunch
we
shall
go
up
the
hillside
to
where
the
theatre
stands
at
the
edge
of
the
and
from
the
porch
the
trumpets
will
give
out
the
motif
of
the
grail
and
we
shall
pass
out
of
the
heat
into
the
cool
darkness
of
the
theatre
aren
t
you
thrilled
comber
doesn
t
a
holy
awe
pervade
you
are
you
worthy
do
you
think
all
this
youthful
unrestrained
enthusiasm
was
a
revelation
to
michael
intentionally
absurd
as
falbe
s
rhapsody
on
the
fatherland
had
been
michael
knew
that
it
sprang
from
a
solid
sincerity
which
was
not
ashamed
of
expressing
itself
living
as
he
had
always
done
in
the
rather
formal
and
reticent
atmosphere
of
his
class
and
environment
he
would
have
thought
this
fervour
of
patriotism
in
an
english
mouth
ridiculous
or
if
persevered
in
merely
bad
form
yet
when
falbe
hailed
the
rhine
and
the
spires
of
cologne
it
was
clear
that
there
was
no
bad
form
about
it
at
all
he
felt
like
that
and
indeed
as
michael
was
beginning
to
perceive
he
felt
with
a
similar
intensity
on
all
subjects
about
which
he
felt
at
all
there
was
something
of
the
same
vivid
quality
about
aunt
barbara
but
aunt
barbara
s
vividness
was
chiefly
devoted
to
the
hunt
of
the
absurdities
of
her
friends
and
it
was
always
the
concretely
ridiculous
that
she
pursued
but
this
handsome
vital
young
man
with
his
eagerness
and
his
welcome
for
the
world
who
had
fallen
with
so
delightful
a
cordiality
into
michael
s
company
had
already
an
attraction
for
him
of
a
sort
he
had
never
felt
before
dimly
as
the
days
went
by
he
began
to
conjecture
that
he
who
had
never
had
a
friend
was
being
hailed
and
halloed
to
was
being
ordered
if
not
by
precept
at
any
rate
by
example
to
come
out
of
the
shell
of
his
reserve
and
let
himself
feel
and
let
himself
express
he
could
see
how
utterly
different
was
falbe
s
general
conception
and
practice
of
life
from
his
own
to
michael
it
had
always
been
a
congregation
of
strangers
francis
excepted
who
moved
about
busy
with
each
other
and
with
affairs
that
had
no
allure
for
him
and
were
though
not
uncivil
wholly
alien
to
him
he
was
willing
to
grant
that
this
alienation
this
absence
of
comradeship
which
he
had
missed
all
his
life
was
of
his
own
making
in
so
far
as
his
shyness
and
sensitiveness
were
the
cause
of
it
but
in
effect
he
had
never
yet
had
a
friend
because
he
had
never
yet
taken
his
shutters
down
so
to
speak
or
thrown
his
front
door
open
he
had
peeped
out
through
chinks
and
felt
how
lonely
he
was
but
he
had
not
given
anyone
a
chance
to
get
in
falbe
on
the
other
hand
lived
at
his
window
ready
to
hail
the
even
as
he
had
hailed
michael
with
cheerful
words
there
he
lounged
in
his
you
might
say
with
elbows
on
the
and
not
from
politeness
but
from
good
fellowship
from
the
fact
that
he
liked
people
was
at
home
to
everybody
he
liked
people
there
was
the
key
to
it
and
michael
however
much
he
might
be
capable
of
liking
people
had
up
till
now
given
them
no
sign
of
it
it
really
was
not
their
fault
if
they
had
not
guessed
it
two
days
passed
on
the
first
of
which
parsifal
was
given
and
on
the
second
meistersinger
on
the
third
there
was
no
performance
and
the
two
young
men
had
agreed
to
meet
in
the
morning
and
drive
out
of
the
town
to
a
neighbouring
village
among
the
hills
and
spend
the
day
there
in
the
woods
michael
had
looked
forward
to
this
day
with
extraordinary
pleasure
but
there
was
mingled
with
it
a
sort
of
agony
of
apprehension
that
falbe
would
find
him
a
very
boring
companion
but
the
precepts
of
aunt
barbara
came
to
his
mind
and
he
reflected
that
the
certain
and
sure
way
of
proving
a
bore
was
to
be
taken
up
with
the
idea
that
he
might
be
and
anyhow
falbe
had
proposed
the
plan
himself
they
lunched
in
a
little
restaurant
near
a
lake
and
since
the
day
was
very
hot
did
no
more
than
stroll
up
the
hill
for
a
hundred
yards
where
they
would
get
some
hint
of
breeze
and
disposed
themselves
at
length
on
the
carpet
of
through
the
thick
boughs
overhead
the
sunlight
reached
them
only
in
specks
and
flakes
the
wind
was
but
as
a
distant
sea
in
the
branches
and
falbe
rolled
over
on
to
his
face
and
sniffed
at
the
aromatic
leaves
with
the
gusto
with
which
he
enjoyed
all
that
was
to
him
enjoyable
ah
that
s
good
that
s
good
he
said
how
i
love
smells
clean
sharp
smells
like
this
but
they
ve
got
to
be
wild
you
can
t
tame
a
smell
and
put
it
on
your
handkerchief
it
takes
the
life
out
of
it
do
you
like
smells
comber
i
i
really
never
thought
about
it
said
michael
think
now
then
and
tell
me
said
falbe
if
you
consider
you
know
such
a
lot
about
me
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
you
i
know
you
like
music
i
know
you
like
blue
trout
because
you
ate
so
many
of
them
at
lunch
but
what
else
do
i
know
about
you
i
don
t
even
know
what
you
thought
of
parsifal
no
perhaps
i
m
wrong
there
because
the
fact
that
you
ve
never
mentioned
it
probably
shows
that
you
couldn
t
the
symptom
of
not
understanding
anything
about
parsifal
is
to
talk
about
it
and
say
what
a
tremendous
impression
it
has
made
on
ah
you
ve
guessed
right
there
said
michael
i
couldn
t
talk
about
it
there
s
nothing
to
say
about
it
except
that
it
is
that
s
true
it
becomes
part
of
you
and
you
can
t
talk
of
it
any
more
than
you
can
talk
about
your
elbows
and
your
knees
it
s
one
of
the
things
that
makes
you
he
turned
over
on
to
his
back
and
laid
his
hands
palm
uppermost
over
his
eyes
that
s
part
of
the
glory
of
it
all
he
said
that
art
and
its
emotions
become
part
of
you
like
the
food
you
eat
and
the
wine
you
drink
art
is
always
making
us
it
enters
into
our
character
and
destiny
as
long
as
you
go
on
growing
you
assimilate
and
thank
god
one
s
mind
or
soul
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
goes
on
growing
for
a
long
time
i
suppose
the
moment
comes
to
most
people
when
they
cease
to
grow
when
they
become
fixed
and
hard
and
that
is
what
we
mean
by
being
old
but
till
then
you
weave
your
destiny
or
rather
people
and
beauty
weave
it
for
you
as
you
ll
see
the
norns
weaving
and
yet
you
never
know
what
you
are
making
you
make
what
you
are
and
you
never
are
because
you
are
always
becoming
you
must
excuse
me
but
germans
are
always
metaphysicians
and
they
can
t
help
go
on
be
german
said
michael
lieber
gott
as
if
i
could
be
anything
else
said
falbe
laughing
we
are
the
only
nation
which
makes
a
science
of
experimentalism
we
try
everything
just
as
a
puppy
tries
everything
it
tries
mutton
bones
and
and
soap
and
boots
it
tries
to
find
out
what
its
tail
is
for
and
bites
it
till
it
hurts
on
which
it
draws
the
conclusion
that
it
is
not
meant
to
eat
like
all
metaphysicians
too
and
dealers
in
the
abstract
we
are
intensely
practical
our
passion
for
experimentalism
is
dictated
by
the
firm
object
of
using
the
knowledge
we
acquire
we
are
tremendously
thorough
we
waste
nothing
not
even
time
whereas
the
english
have
an
absolute
genius
for
wasting
time
look
at
all
your
games
your
sports
your
athletics
i
am
being
quite
german
now
and
forgetting
my
mother
bless
her
they
are
merely
devices
for
getting
rid
of
the
hours
and
so
not
having
to
think
you
hate
thought
as
a
nation
and
we
live
for
it
music
is
thought
all
art
is
thought
commercial
prosperity
is
thought
soldiering
is
and
we
are
a
nation
of
idiots
asked
michael
no
i
didn
t
say
that
i
should
say
you
are
a
nation
of
sensualists
you
value
sensation
above
everything
you
pursue
the
enjoyable
you
are
a
nation
of
children
who
are
always
having
a
perpetual
holiday
you
go
straying
all
over
the
world
for
fun
and
annex
it
generally
so
that
you
can
have
in
india
and
lots
of
gold
to
pay
for
your
in
africa
and
fur
from
canada
for
your
coats
but
it
s
all
a
game
not
one
man
in
a
thousand
in
england
has
any
idea
of
oh
i
think
you
are
wrong
there
said
michael
you
believe
that
only
because
we
don
t
talk
about
it
it
s
it
s
like
what
we
agreed
about
parsifal
we
don
t
talk
about
it
because
it
is
so
much
part
of
falbe
sat
up
i
deny
it
i
deny
it
flatly
he
said
i
know
where
i
get
my
power
of
foolish
unthinking
enjoyment
from
and
it
s
from
my
english
blood
i
rejoice
in
my
english
blood
because
you
are
the
happiest
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
but
you
are
happy
because
you
don
t
think
whereas
the
joy
of
being
german
is
that
you
do
think
england
is
lying
in
the
shade
like
us
with
a
cigarette
and
a
drink
i
wish
i
had
one
and
a
golf
ball
or
the
world
with
which
she
has
been
playing
her
game
but
germany
is
sitting
up
all
night
thinking
and
every
morning
she
gives
an
order
or
michael
supplied
the
cigarette
do
you
mean
she
is
thinking
about
england
s
golf
ball
asked
michael
why
of
course
she
is
what
else
is
there
to
think
about
oh
it
s
impossible
that
there
should
be
a
european
war
said
michael
for
that
is
what
it
will
mean
and
why
is
a
european
war
impossible
demanded
falbe
lighting
his
cigarette
it
s
simply
unthinkable
because
you
don
t
think
he
interrupted
i
can
tell
you
that
the
thought
of
war
is
never
absent
for
a
single
day
from
the
average
german
mind
we
are
all
soldiers
you
see
we
start
with
that
you
start
by
being
golfers
and
cricketers
but
der
tag
is
never
quite
absent
from
the
german
mind
i
don
t
say
that
all
you
golfers
and
cricketers
wouldn
t
make
good
soldiers
but
you
ve
got
to
be
made
you
can
t
be
a
golfer
one
day
and
a
soldier
the
michael
laughed
as
for
that
he
said
i
made
an
uncommonly
bad
soldier
but
i
am
an
even
worse
golfer
as
for
cricket
falbe
again
interrupted
ah
then
at
last
i
know
two
things
about
you
he
said
you
were
a
soldier
and
you
can
t
play
golf
i
have
never
known
so
little
about
anybody
after
three
four
days
however
what
is
our
proverb
live
and
but
it
takes
longer
to
learn
than
to
live
eh
what
nonsense
i
he
spoke
with
a
sudden
irritation
and
the
laugh
at
the
end
of
his
speech
was
not
one
of
amusement
but
rather
of
mockery
to
michael
this
mood
was
quite
inexplicable
but
characteristically
he
looked
about
in
himself
for
the
possible
explanation
of
it
but
what
s
the
matter
he
asked
have
i
annoyed
you
somehow
i
m
awfully
falbe
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
no
you
ve
not
annoyed
me
he
said
i
ve
annoyed
myself
but
that
s
the
worst
of
living
on
one
s
nerves
which
is
the
penalty
of
baireuth
there
is
no
charge
so
to
speak
except
for
your
ticket
but
a
collection
is
made
as
happens
at
meetings
and
you
pay
with
your
nerves
you
must
cancel
my
annoyance
please
if
i
showed
it
i
did
not
mean
michael
pondered
over
this
but
i
can
t
leave
it
like
that
he
said
at
length
was
it
about
the
possibility
of
war
which
i
said
was
unthinkable
falbe
laughed
and
turned
on
his
elbow
towards
michael
no
my
dear
chap
he
said
you
may
believe
it
to
be
unthinkable
and
i
may
believe
it
to
be
inevitable
but
what
does
it
matter
what
either
of
us
believes
che
sara
sara
it
was
quite
another
thing
that
caused
me
to
annoy
myself
it
does
not
michael
lay
back
on
the
soft
slope
yet
i
insist
on
knowing
he
said
that
is
i
mean
if
it
is
not
falbe
lay
quietly
with
his
long
fingers
in
the
sediment
of
well
then
as
it
is
not
private
and
as
you
insist
he
said
i
will
certainly
tell
you
does
it
not
strike
you
that
you
are
behaving
like
an
absolute
stranger
to
me
we
have
talked
of
me
and
my
home
and
my
plans
all
the
time
since
we
met
at
victoria
station
and
you
have
kept
complete
silence
about
yourself
i
know
nothing
of
you
not
who
you
are
or
what
you
are
or
what
your
flag
is
you
fly
no
flag
you
proclaim
no
identity
you
may
be
a
or
a
grocer
or
a
marquis
for
all
i
know
of
course
that
matters
very
little
but
what
does
matter
is
that
never
for
a
moment
have
you
shown
me
not
what
you
happen
to
be
but
what
you
are
i
ve
got
the
impression
that
you
are
something
that
there
s
a
real
you
in
your
inside
but
you
don
t
let
me
see
it
you
send
a
polite
servant
to
the
door
when
i
knock
probably
this
sounds
very
weird
and
to
you
but
to
my
mind
it
is
much
more
weird
to
behave
as
you
are
behaving
come
out
can
t
you
let
s
look
at
it
was
exactly
that
that
brusque
unsentimental
appeal
that
michael
needed
he
saw
himself
at
that
moment
as
falbe
saw
him
a
shelled
and
muffled
figure
intangible
and
withdrawn
but
observing
as
it
were
through
and
giving
nothing
in
exchange
for
what
he
saw
i
m
sorry
he
said
it
s
quite
true
what
you
tell
me
i
m
like
that
but
it
really
has
never
struck
me
that
anybody
cared
to
falbe
ceased
digging
his
excavation
in
the
and
looked
up
on
michael
good
lord
man
he
said
people
care
if
you
ll
only
allow
them
to
the
indifference
of
other
people
is
a
false
term
for
the
secretiveness
of
oneself
how
can
they
care
unless
you
let
them
know
what
there
is
to
care
for
but
i
m
completely
uninteresting
said
michael
yes
i
ll
judge
of
that
said
falbe
slowly
and
with
diffident
pauses
michael
began
to
speak
of
himself
feeling
at
first
as
if
he
was
undressing
in
public
but
as
he
went
on
he
became
conscious
of
the
welcome
that
his
story
received
though
that
welcome
only
expressed
itself
in
perfectly
unemotional
monosyllables
he
might
be
undressing
but
he
was
undressing
in
front
of
a
fire
he
knew
that
he
uncovered
himself
to
no
icy
blast
or
contemptuous
rain
as
he
had
felt
when
so
few
days
before
he
had
spoken
of
himself
and
what
he
was
to
his
father
there
was
here
the
common
land
of
music
to
build
upon
whereas
to
lord
ashbridge
that
same
soil
had
been
so
to
speak
the
territory
of
the
enemy
and
even
more
than
that
there
was
the
instinct
the
certain
conviction
that
he
was
telling
his
tale
to
sympathetic
ears
to
which
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
speaking
of
himself
presupposed
a
friendly
hearing
falbe
he
felt
wanted
to
know
about
him
regardless
of
the
nature
of
his
confessions
had
he
said
that
he
was
an
undetected
kleptomaniac
falbe
would
have
liked
to
know
have
been
pleased
at
any
tidings
provided
only
they
were
authentic
this
seemed
to
reveal
itself
to
him
even
as
he
spoke
it
had
been
there
waiting
for
him
to
claim
it
lying
there
as
in
a
poste
restante
only
ready
for
its
owner
at
the
end
falbe
gave
a
long
sigh
and
why
the
devil
didn
t
you
give
me
any
hint
of
it
before
he
asked
i
didn
t
think
it
mattered
said
michael
well
then
you
are
amazingly
wrong
good
lord
it
s
about
the
most
interesting
thing
i
ve
ever
heard
i
didn
t
know
anybody
could
escape
from
that
awful
sort
of
in
which
our
i
m
english
now
in
which
our
upper
class
immures
itself
yet
you
ve
done
it
i
take
it
that
the
thing
is
done
now
i
m
not
going
back
into
the
again
if
you
mean
that
said
michael
and
will
your
father
cut
you
off
asked
he
oh
i
haven
t
the
least
idea
said
michael
aren
t
you
going
to
inquire
michael
hesitated
no
i
m
sure
i
m
not
he
said
i
can
t
do
that
it
s
his
business
i
couldn
t
ask
about
what
he
had
done
or
meant
to
do
it
s
a
sort
of
pride
i
suppose
he
will
do
as
he
thinks
proper
and
when
he
has
thought
perhaps
he
will
tell
me
what
he
but
then
how
will
you
live
asked
falbe
oh
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
i
ve
got
some
money
quite
a
lot
i
mean
from
my
grandmother
in
some
ways
i
rather
wish
i
hadn
t
it
would
have
been
a
proof
of
sincerity
to
have
become
poor
that
wouldn
t
have
made
the
smallest
difference
to
my
falbe
laughed
and
so
you
are
rich
and
yet
go
he
said
if
i
were
rich
i
would
make
myself
exceedingly
comfortable
i
like
things
that
are
good
to
eat
and
soft
to
touch
but
i
m
bound
to
say
that
i
get
on
quite
excellently
without
them
being
poor
does
not
make
the
smallest
difference
to
one
s
happiness
but
only
to
the
number
of
one
s
michael
paused
a
moment
and
then
found
courage
to
say
what
for
the
last
two
days
he
had
been
longing
to
give
utterance
to
i
know
but
pleasures
are
very
nice
things
he
said
and
doesn
t
it
seem
obvious
now
that
you
are
coming
to
munich
with
me
it
s
a
purely
selfish
suggestion
on
my
part
after
being
with
you
it
will
be
very
stupid
to
be
alone
there
but
it
would
be
so
delightful
if
you
would
falbe
looked
at
him
a
moment
without
speaking
but
michael
saw
the
light
in
his
eyes
and
what
if
i
have
my
pride
too
he
said
then
i
shall
apologise
for
having
made
the
proposal
said
michael
simply
for
just
a
second
more
falbe
hesitated
then
he
held
out
his
hand
i
thank
you
most
awfully
he
said
i
accept
with
the
greatest
michael
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
i
am
glad
he
said
so
that
s
settled
it
s
really
nice
of
the
heat
of
the
day
was
passing
off
and
over
the
plain
the
coolness
of
evening
was
beginning
to
steal
overhead
the
wind
stirred
more
resonantly
in
the
pines
and
in
the
bushes
birds
called
to
each
other
presently
after
they
rose
from
where
they
had
lain
all
the
afternoon
and
strolled
along
the
needled
slope
to
where
through
a
vista
in
the
trees
they
looked
down
on
the
lake
and
the
hamlet
that
clustered
near
it
down
the
road
that
wound
through
the
trees
towards
it
passed
labourers
going
homeward
from
their
work
with
cheerful
guttural
cries
to
each
other
and
a
herd
of
cows
sauntered
by
with
bells
melodiously
chiming
taking
leisurely
mouthfuls
from
the
herbage
of
the
wayside
in
the
village
lying
low
in
the
clear
dusk
scattered
lights
began
to
appear
the
smoke
of
evening
fires
to
ascend
and
the
aromatic
odour
of
the
burning
wood
strayed
towards
them
up
the
wind
falbe
whose
hand
lay
in
the
crook
of
michael
s
arm
pointed
downwards
to
the
village
that
lay
there
sequestered
and
rural
that
s
germany
he
said
it
s
that
which
lies
at
the
back
of
every
german
heart
there
lie
the
springs
of
the
rhine
it
s
out
of
that
originally
that
there
came
all
that
germany
stands
for
its
music
its
poetry
its
philosophy
its
kultur
all
flowed
from
these
quiet
uplands
it
was
here
that
the
nation
began
to
think
and
to
dream
to
dreamt
it
s
out
of
dreams
that
all
has
he
laughed
and
then
next
week
when
we
go
to
munich
you
will
find
me
saying
that
this
this
athens
of
a
town
with
its
museums
and
its
galleries
and
its
music
is
germany
i
shall
be
right
too
out
of
much
dreaming
comes
the
need
to
make
it
is
when
the
artist
s
head
and
heart
are
full
of
his
dreams
that
his
hands
itch
for
the
palette
or
the
piano
nuremberg
can
not
we
stop
a
few
hours
at
least
in
nuremberg
and
see
the
meadow
by
the
pegnitz
where
the
meistersingers
held
their
contest
of
song
and
the
wooden
gabled
house
where
albrecht
durer
lived
that
will
teach
you
germany
too
the
bud
of
their
dream
was
opening
then
and
what
flower
even
in
the
magnificence
of
its
is
so
lovely
albrecht
durer
with
his
deep
patient
eyes
and
his
patient
hands
with
their
unerring
stroke
or
bach
with
the
fugue
flowing
from
his
brain
through
his
quick
fingers
making
stars
stars
fixed
forever
in
the
heaven
of
harmony
don
t
tell
me
that
there
is
anything
in
the
world
more
wonderful
we
may
have
invented
a
few
more
instruments
we
may
have
experimented
with
a
few
more
combinations
of
notes
but
in
the
b
minor
mass
or
in
the
music
of
the
passion
all
is
said
and
all
that
came
from
the
woods
and
the
country
and
the
quiet
life
in
little
towns
when
the
artist
did
his
work
because
he
loved
it
and
cared
not
one
jot
about
what
anybody
else
thought
about
it
we
are
a
nation
of
thinkers
and
michael
hesitated
a
moment
but
you
said
not
long
ago
that
you
were
also
the
most
practical
nation
he
said
you
are
a
nation
of
soldiers
and
who
would
not
willingly
give
himself
for
such
a
fatherland
said
falbe
if
need
be
we
will
lay
our
lives
down
for
that
and
die
more
willingly
than
we
have
lived
god
grant
that
the
need
comes
not
but
should
it
come
we
are
ready
we
are
bound
to
be
ready
it
would
be
a
crime
not
to
be
ready
a
crime
against
the
fatherland
we
love
peace
but
the
are
just
those
who
in
war
are
most
terrible
for
who
are
the
backbone
of
war
when
war
comes
the
women
of
the
country
my
friend
not
the
ministers
not
the
generals
and
the
admirals
i
don
t
say
they
make
war
but
when
war
is
made
they
are
the
spirit
of
it
because
more
than
men
they
love
their
homes
there
is
not
a
woman
in
germany
who
will
not
send
forth
brother
and
husband
and
father
and
child
should
the
day
come
but
it
will
not
come
from
our
he
turned
to
michael
his
face
illuminated
by
the
red
glow
of
the
sinking
sun
germany
will
rise
as
one
man
if
she
s
told
to
he
said
for
that
is
what
her
unity
and
her
discipline
mean
she
is
patient
and
peaceful
but
she
is
he
pointed
northwards
it
is
from
there
from
prussia
from
berlin
he
said
that
the
word
will
come
if
they
who
rule
and
govern
us
and
in
whose
hands
are
all
organisation
and
equipment
tell
us
that
our
national
existence
compels
us
to
fight
they
rule
the
prussians
rule
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
from
germany
have
come
the
arts
the
sciences
the
philosophies
of
the
world
and
not
from
there
but
they
guard
our
national
life
it
is
they
who
watch
by
the
rhine
for
us
patient
and
awake
should
they
beckon
us
one
night
on
some
peaceful
august
night
like
this
when
all
seems
so
tranquil
so
secure
we
shall
go
the
silent
beckoning
finger
will
be
obeyed
from
one
end
of
the
land
to
the
other
from
poland
on
the
east
to
france
on
the
he
turned
away
quickly
it
does
not
bear
thinking
of
he
said
and
yet
there
are
many
oh
so
many
who
night
and
day
concern
themselves
with
nothing
else
let
us
be
english
again
and
not
think
of
anything
serious
or
unpleasant
already
as
you
know
i
am
half
english
there
is
something
to
build
upon
ah
and
this
is
the
sentimental
hour
just
when
the
sun
begins
to
touch
the
horizon
line
of
the
stale
weary
old
earth
and
turns
it
into
rosy
gold
and
heals
its
troubles
and
its
weariness
schon
schon
he
stood
for
a
moment
bareheaded
to
the
breeze
and
made
a
great
florid
salutation
to
the
sun
now
only
above
the
horizon
there
i
have
said
my
evensong
he
remarked
like
a
good
german
who
always
and
always
is
ridiculous
to
the
whole
world
except
those
who
are
german
also
oh
i
can
see
how
we
look
to
the
rest
of
the
world
so
well
beer
mug
in
one
hand
and
mouth
full
of
sausage
and
song
and
with
the
other
hand
perhaps
fingering
a
revolver
how
unreal
it
must
seem
to
you
how
affected
and
yet
how
in
truth
you
miss
it
all
scratch
a
russian
they
say
and
you
find
a
tartar
but
scratch
a
german
and
you
find
two
things
a
sentimentalist
and
a
soldier
lieber
gott
no
i
will
say
good
god
i
am
english
again
and
if
you
scratch
me
you
will
find
a
golf
he
took
michael
s
arm
again
well
we
ve
spent
one
day
together
he
said
and
now
we
know
something
of
who
we
are
i
put
this
day
in
the
bank
it
s
mine
or
yours
or
both
of
ours
i
won
t
tell
you
how
i
ve
enjoyed
it
or
you
will
say
that
i
have
enjoyed
it
because
i
have
talked
almost
all
the
time
but
since
it
s
the
sentimental
hour
i
will
tell
you
that
you
mistake
i
have
enjoyed
it
because
i
believe
i
have
found
a
chapter
v
hermann
falbe
had
just
gone
back
to
his
lodgings
at
the
end
of
the
richard
wagner
strasse
late
on
the
night
of
their
last
day
at
baireuth
and
michael
who
had
leaned
out
of
his
window
to
remind
him
of
the
hour
of
their
train
s
departure
the
next
morning
turned
back
into
the
room
to
begin
his
packing
that
was
not
an
affair
that
would
take
much
time
but
since
on
this
sweltering
august
night
it
would
certainly
be
a
process
that
involved
the
production
of
much
heat
he
made
ready
for
bed
first
and
went
about
his
preparations
in
pyjamas
the
work
of
dropping
things
into
a
bag
was
soon
over
and
finding
it
impossible
to
entertain
the
idea
of
sleep
he
drew
one
of
the
stiff
to
the
window
and
slipped
the
rein
from
his
thoughts
letting
them
gallop
where
they
pleased
in
all
his
life
he
had
never
experienced
so
much
sheer
emotion
as
the
last
week
had
held
for
him
he
had
enjoyed
his
first
taste
of
liberty
he
had
stripped
himself
naked
to
music
he
had
found
a
friend
any
one
of
these
would
have
been
sufficient
to
saturate
him
and
they
had
all
in
the
decrees
of
fate
come
together
his
life
hitherto
had
been
like
some
dry
sponge
dusty
and
crackling
now
it
was
plunged
in
the
waters
of
three
seas
all
incomparably
sweet
he
had
gained
his
liberty
and
in
that
process
he
had
forgotten
about
himself
the
self
which
up
till
now
had
been
so
intolerable
a
burden
at
school
and
even
before
when
first
the
age
of
dawned
upon
him
he
had
seen
himself
as
he
believed
others
saw
him
a
queer
awkward
boy
slow
at
his
work
shy
with
his
fellows
incapable
at
games
walled
up
in
this
fortress
of
himself
this
gloomy
and
forbidding
fastness
he
had
altogether
failed
to
find
the
means
of
access
to
others
both
to
the
normal
english
boys
among
whom
his
path
lay
and
also
to
his
teachers
who
not
unnaturally
found
him
sullen
and
unresponsive
there
was
no
key
among
the
rather
limited
bunches
at
their
command
which
unlocked
him
nor
at
home
had
anything
been
found
which
could
fit
his
wards
it
had
been
the
business
of
school
to
turn
out
boys
of
certain
received
types
there
was
the
clever
boy
the
athletic
boy
the
merely
pleasant
boy
these
and
the
combinations
arrived
at
from
these
types
were
the
output
there
was
no
use
for
others
then
had
succeeded
those
three
nightmare
years
in
the
guards
where
with
his
more
mature
power
of
observation
he
had
become
more
actively
conscious
of
his
inability
to
take
his
place
on
any
of
the
recognised
platforms
and
all
the
time
like
an
owl
on
his
solitary
perch
he
had
gazed
out
lonelily
while
the
other
birds
of
day
too
polite
to
mock
him
had
merely
passed
him
by
one
such
it
is
true
his
cousin
had
sat
by
him
and
the
poor
owl
s
heart
had
gone
out
to
him
but
even
francis
so
he
saw
now
had
not
understood
he
had
but
accepted
the
fact
of
him
without
repugnance
had
been
fond
of
him
as
a
queer
sort
of
kind
elder
cousin
then
there
was
aunt
barbara
aunt
barbara
michael
allowed
had
understood
a
good
deal
she
had
pointed
out
with
her
unerringly
humourous
finger
the
obstacles
he
had
made
for
himself
but
could
aunt
barbara
understand
the
rapture
of
living
which
this
one
week
of
liberty
had
given
him
that
michael
doubted
she
had
only
pointed
out
the
disabilities
he
made
for
himself
she
did
not
know
what
he
was
capable
of
in
the
way
of
happiness
but
he
thought
though
without
how
delightful
it
would
be
to
show
himself
the
new
unshelled
self
to
aunt
barbara
again
a
laughing
couple
went
tapping
down
the
street
below
his
window
boy
and
girl
with
arms
and
waists
interlaced
they
were
laughing
at
nothing
at
all
except
that
they
were
boy
and
girl
together
and
it
was
all
glorious
fun
but
the
sight
of
them
gave
michael
a
sudden
spasm
of
envy
with
all
this
enlightenment
that
had
come
to
him
during
this
last
week
there
had
come
no
gleam
of
what
that
simplest
and
commonest
aspect
of
human
nature
meant
he
had
never
felt
towards
a
girl
what
that
german
boy
felt
he
was
not
sure
but
he
thought
he
disliked
girls
they
meant
nothing
to
him
anyhow
and
the
mere
thought
of
his
arm
round
a
girl
s
waist
only
suggested
a
very
embarrassing
attitude
he
had
nothing
to
say
to
them
and
the
knowledge
of
his
inability
filled
him
with
an
uncomfortable
sense
of
his
want
of
normality
just
as
did
the
consciousness
of
his
long
arms
and
stumpy
legs
there
was
a
night
he
remembered
when
francis
had
insisted
that
he
should
go
with
him
to
a
discreet
little
supper
party
after
an
evening
at
the
there
were
just
four
of
them
he
francis
and
two
companions
and
he
played
the
role
of
sour
gooseberry
to
his
cousin
who
with
the
utmost
gaiety
had
proved
himself
completely
equal
to
the
inauspicious
occasion
and
had
drank
indiscriminately
out
of
both
the
girls
glasses
and
lit
cigarettes
for
them
and
after
seeing
them
both
home
had
looked
in
on
michael
and
gone
into
fits
of
laughter
at
his
general
incompatibility
the
steps
and
conversation
passed
round
the
corner
and
michael
stretching
his
bare
toes
on
to
the
cool
balcony
resumed
his
researches
those
joyful
unegoistic
researches
into
himself
his
liberty
was
bound
up
with
his
music
the
first
gave
the
key
to
the
second
often
as
he
had
rested
so
to
speak
in
oases
of
music
in
london
they
were
but
a
pause
from
the
desert
of
his
uncongenial
life
into
the
desert
again
but
now
the
desert
was
vanished
and
the
oasis
stretched
illimitable
to
the
horizon
in
front
of
him
that
was
where
for
the
future
his
life
was
to
be
passed
not
idly
sitting
under
trees
but
in
the
eager
pursuit
of
its
unnumbered
paths
it
was
that
aspect
of
it
which
as
he
knew
so
well
his
father
for
instance
would
never
be
able
to
understand
to
lord
ashbridge
s
mind
music
was
vaguely
connected
with
white
waistcoats
and
opera
glasses
and
large
pink
carnations
he
was
congenitally
incapable
of
viewing
it
in
any
other
light
than
a
diversion
something
that
took
place
between
nine
and
eleven
o
clock
in
the
evening
and
in
smaller
quantities
at
church
on
sunday
morning
he
would
undoubtedly
have
said
that
handel
s
messiah
was
the
noblest
example
of
music
in
the
world
because
of
its
subject
music
did
not
exist
for
him
as
a
separate
definite
and
infinite
factor
of
life
and
since
it
did
not
so
exist
for
himself
he
could
not
imagine
it
existing
for
anybody
else
that
michael
correctly
knew
to
be
his
father
s
general
demeanour
towards
life
he
wanted
everybody
in
their
respective
spheres
to
be
like
what
he
was
in
his
they
must
take
their
part
as
he
undoubtedly
did
in
the
when
the
british
aristocracy
came
into
being
a
fresh
factor
had
come
into
michael
s
conception
of
music
during
these
last
seven
days
he
had
become
aware
that
germany
was
music
he
had
naturally
known
before
that
the
vast
proportion
of
music
came
from
germany
that
almost
all
of
that
which
meant
music
to
him
was
of
german
origin
but
that
was
a
very
different
affair
from
the
conviction
now
borne
in
on
his
mind
that
there
was
not
only
no
music
apart
from
germany
but
that
there
was
no
germany
apart
from
music
but
every
moment
he
spent
in
this
wayside
puddle
of
a
town
for
so
baireuth
seemed
to
an
unbiased
view
he
became
more
and
more
aware
that
music
beat
in
the
german
blood
even
as
sport
beat
in
the
blood
of
his
own
people
during
this
festival
week
baireuth
existed
only
because
of
that
at
other
times
baireuth
was
probably
as
as
any
dull
and
minor
town
in
the
english
midlands
but
owing
to
the
fact
of
music
being
for
these
weeks
resident
in
baireuth
the
sordid
little
townlet
became
the
capital
of
the
huge
patient
empire
it
existed
just
now
simply
for
that
reason
with
the
curtain
of
the
last
act
of
parsifal
it
had
ceased
to
exist
again
it
was
not
that
a
patriotic
desire
to
honour
one
of
the
national
heroes
in
the
home
where
he
had
been
established
by
the
mad
genius
of
a
bavarian
king
that
moved
them
it
was
because
for
the
moment
that
baireuth
to
germans
meant
germany
from
berlin
from
dresden
from
frankfurt
from
luxemburg
from
a
hundred
towns
those
who
were
most
typically
german
whether
high
or
low
rich
or
poor
made
their
joyous
pilgrimage
joy
and
solemnity
exultation
and
the
yearning
that
could
never
be
satisfied
drew
them
here
and
even
as
music
was
in
michael
s
heart
so
germany
was
there
also
they
were
the
people
who
understood
they
did
not
go
to
the
opera
as
a
interlude
between
a
dinner
and
a
dance
they
came
to
this
dreadful
little
town
the
discomforts
of
which
the
utter
provinciality
of
which
was
transformed
into
the
air
of
the
heavenly
jerusalem
as
hermann
falbe
had
said
because
their
souls
were
fed
here
with
wine
and
manna
he
would
find
the
same
thing
at
munich
so
falbe
had
told
him
the
next
week
the
loves
and
the
tragedies
of
the
great
titanic
forces
that
saw
the
making
of
the
world
the
dreams
and
the
deeds
of
the
masters
of
nuremberg
above
all
sacrifice
and
enlightenment
and
redemption
of
the
soul
how
except
by
music
could
these
be
made
manifest
it
was
the
first
and
only
and
final
alchemy
that
could
by
its
magic
transformation
give
an
answer
to
the
tremendous
riddles
of
consciousness
that
could
lift
you
though
tearing
and
making
mincemeat
of
you
to
the
serenity
of
the
whence
was
seen
the
promised
land
it
in
itself
was
reality
and
the
who
admitted
you
into
that
enchanted
realm
was
the
spirit
of
germany
not
france
with
its
little
morbid
shiverings
and
its
called
love
not
italy
with
its
melodious
declamations
and
tawdry
tunes
not
russia
even
with
the
wind
of
its
impenetrable
winters
its
sense
of
joys
snatched
from
its
eternal
frosts
gave
admittance
there
but
germany
deep
patient
germany
that
sprang
from
upland
hamlets
and
flowed
down
with
stream
into
the
illimitable
ocean
here
then
were
two
of
the
initiations
that
had
come
with
the
swiftness
of
the
spate
in
alpine
valleys
at
the
melting
of
the
snow
upon
michael
his
own
liberty
namely
and
this
new
sense
of
music
he
had
groped
he
felt
now
like
a
blind
man
in
that
direction
guided
only
by
his
instinct
and
on
a
sudden
the
scales
had
fallen
from
his
eyes
and
he
knew
that
his
instinct
had
guided
him
right
but
not
less
had
been
the
dawn
of
friendship
throughout
the
week
his
intimacy
with
hermann
falbe
had
developed
shooting
up
like
an
aloe
flower
and
rising
into
sunlight
above
the
mists
of
his
own
shyness
which
had
so
darkly
beset
him
all
life
long
he
had
given
the
best
that
he
knew
of
himself
to
his
cousin
but
all
the
time
there
had
never
quite
been
absent
from
his
mind
his
sense
of
inferiority
a
sort
of
aching
wonder
why
he
could
not
be
more
like
francis
more
careless
more
capable
of
enjoyment
more
of
a
normal
type
but
with
falbe
he
was
able
for
the
first
time
to
forget
himself
altogether
he
had
met
a
man
who
did
not
recall
him
to
himself
but
took
him
clean
out
of
that
tedious
dwelling
which
he
knew
so
well
and
indeed
disliked
so
much
he
was
rid
for
the
first
time
of
his
morbid
his
anchor
had
been
taken
up
from
its
dragging
in
the
sand
and
he
rode
free
buoyed
on
waters
and
taken
by
tides
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
wonder
whether
falbe
thought
him
uncouth
and
awkward
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
try
to
be
pleasant
a
job
over
which
poor
michael
had
so
often
found
himself
dishearteningly
incapable
he
let
himself
be
himself
in
the
consciousness
that
this
was
sufficient
they
had
spent
the
morning
together
before
this
second
performance
of
parsifal
that
closed
their
series
in
the
woods
above
the
theatre
and
michael
no
longer
blurting
out
his
speeches
but
speaking
in
the
quiet
orderly
manner
in
which
he
thought
discussed
his
plans
i
shall
come
back
to
london
with
you
after
munich
he
said
and
settle
down
to
study
i
do
know
a
certain
amount
about
harmony
already
i
have
been
mugging
it
up
for
the
last
three
years
but
i
must
do
something
as
well
as
learn
something
and
as
i
told
you
i
m
going
to
take
up
the
piano
falbe
was
not
attending
particularly
a
fine
instrument
the
piano
he
remarked
there
is
certainly
something
to
be
done
with
a
piano
if
you
know
how
to
do
it
i
can
strum
a
bit
myself
some
keys
are
harder
than
others
the
black
yes
what
of
the
black
notes
asked
michael
oh
they
re
black
the
rest
are
white
i
beg
your
pardon
michael
laughed
when
you
have
finished
drivelling
he
said
you
might
let
me
i
have
finished
drivelling
michael
i
was
thinking
about
something
not
really
then
it
was
impolite
of
you
but
you
haven
t
any
manners
i
was
talking
about
my
career
i
want
to
do
something
and
these
large
hands
are
really
rather
nimble
but
i
must
be
taught
the
question
is
whether
you
will
teach
falbe
hesitated
i
can
t
tell
you
he
said
till
i
have
heard
you
play
it
s
like
this
i
can
t
teach
you
to
play
unless
you
know
how
and
i
can
t
tell
if
you
know
how
until
i
have
heard
you
if
you
have
got
that
particular
sort
of
temperament
that
can
put
itself
into
the
notes
out
of
the
ends
of
your
fingers
i
can
teach
you
and
i
will
but
if
you
haven
t
i
shall
feel
bound
to
advise
you
to
try
the
jew
s
harp
and
see
if
you
can
get
it
out
of
your
teeth
i
m
not
mocking
you
i
fancy
you
know
that
but
some
people
however
keenly
and
rightly
they
feel
can
not
bring
their
feelings
out
through
their
fingers
others
can
it
is
a
special
gift
if
you
haven
t
got
it
i
can
t
teach
you
anything
and
there
is
no
use
in
wasting
your
time
and
mine
you
can
teach
yourself
to
be
frightfully
nimble
with
your
fingers
and
all
the
people
who
don
t
know
will
say
how
divinely
lord
comber
plays
that
sweet
thing
is
it
brahms
or
mendelssohn
but
i
can
t
really
help
you
towards
that
you
can
do
that
for
yourself
but
if
you
ve
got
the
other
i
can
and
will
teach
you
all
that
you
really
know
go
on
said
michael
that
s
just
the
devil
with
the
piano
said
falbe
it
s
the
easiest
instrument
of
all
to
make
a
show
on
and
it
is
the
rarest
sort
of
person
who
can
play
on
it
that
s
why
all
those
years
i
have
hated
giving
lessons
if
one
has
to
as
i
have
had
to
one
must
take
any
awful
miss
with
a
pigtail
and
make
a
sham
pianist
of
her
one
can
always
do
that
but
it
would
be
waste
of
time
for
you
and
me
you
wouldn
t
want
to
be
made
a
sham
pianist
and
simply
i
wouldn
t
make
you
michael
turned
round
good
lord
he
said
the
suspense
is
worse
than
i
can
bear
isn
t
there
a
piano
in
your
room
can
t
we
go
down
there
and
have
it
over
yes
if
you
wish
i
can
tell
at
once
if
you
are
capable
of
playing
at
least
whether
i
think
you
are
capable
of
playing
whether
i
can
teach
but
i
haven
t
touched
a
piano
for
a
week
said
michael
it
doesn
t
matter
whether
you
ve
touched
a
piano
for
a
michael
had
not
been
prevented
by
the
economy
that
made
him
travel
from
engaging
a
carriage
by
the
day
at
baireuth
since
that
clearly
was
worth
while
and
they
found
it
waiting
for
them
by
the
theatre
there
was
still
time
to
drive
to
falbe
s
lodging
and
get
through
this
crucial
ordeal
before
the
opera
and
they
went
straight
there
a
very
venerable
instrument
which
falbe
had
not
yet
opened
stood
against
the
wall
and
he
struck
a
few
notes
on
it
completely
out
of
tune
he
said
but
that
doesn
t
matter
now
then
but
what
am
i
to
play
asked
michael
anything
you
he
sat
down
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
put
his
long
legs
up
on
to
another
chair
and
waited
michael
sent
a
despairing
glance
at
that
gay
face
suddenly
grown
grim
and
took
his
seat
he
felt
a
paralysing
conviction
that
falbe
s
judgment
whatever
that
might
turn
out
to
be
would
be
right
and
the
knowledge
turned
his
fingers
stiff
from
the
few
notes
that
falbe
had
struck
he
guessed
on
what
sort
of
instrument
his
ordeal
was
to
take
place
and
yet
he
knew
that
falbe
himself
would
have
been
able
to
convey
to
him
the
sense
that
he
could
play
though
the
piano
was
all
out
of
tune
and
there
might
be
dumb
disconcerting
notes
in
it
there
was
justice
in
falbe
s
dictum
about
the
temperament
that
lay
behind
the
player
which
would
assert
itself
through
any
faultiness
of
instrument
and
through
so
he
suspected
any
faultiness
of
execution
he
struck
a
chord
and
heard
it
jangle
dissonantly
oh
it
s
not
fair
he
said
get
on
said
falbe
in
spite
of
germany
there
occurred
to
michael
a
chopin
prelude
at
which
he
had
worked
a
little
during
the
last
two
months
in
london
the
notes
he
knew
perfectly
he
had
believed
also
that
he
had
found
a
certain
conception
of
it
as
a
whole
so
that
he
could
make
something
coherent
out
of
it
not
merely
adding
bar
to
correct
bar
and
he
began
the
soft
repetition
of
with
which
it
opened
then
after
stumbling
wretchedly
through
two
lines
of
it
he
suddenly
forgot
himself
and
falbe
and
the
squealing
unresponsive
notes
he
heard
them
no
more
absorbed
in
the
knowledge
of
what
he
meant
by
them
of
the
mood
which
they
produced
in
him
his
great
ungainly
hands
had
all
the
gentleness
and
that
strength
gives
and
the
chords
were
as
light
and
as
fine
as
the
settling
of
some
poised
bird
on
a
bough
in
the
last
few
lines
of
the
prelude
a
deep
bass
note
had
to
be
struck
at
the
beginning
of
each
bar
this
michael
found
was
completely
dumb
but
so
clear
and
vivid
was
the
effect
of
it
in
his
mind
that
he
scarcely
noticed
that
it
returned
no
answer
to
his
finger
at
the
end
he
sat
without
moving
his
hands
dropped
on
to
his
knees
falbe
got
up
and
coming
over
to
the
piano
struck
the
bass
note
himself
yes
i
knew
it
was
dumb
he
said
but
you
made
me
think
it
wasn
t
you
got
quite
a
good
tone
out
of
he
paused
a
moment
again
striking
the
dumb
note
as
if
to
make
sure
that
it
was
soundless
yes
i
ll
teach
you
he
said
all
the
technique
you
have
got
you
know
is
wrong
from
beginning
to
end
and
you
mustn
t
mind
unlearning
all
that
but
you
ve
got
the
thing
that
all
this
stewed
and
seethed
in
michael
s
mind
as
he
sat
that
night
by
the
window
looking
out
on
to
the
silent
and
empty
street
his
thoughts
flowed
without
check
or
guide
from
his
will
wandering
wherever
their
course
happened
to
take
them
now
lingering
like
the
water
of
a
river
in
some
deep
still
pool
when
he
thought
of
the
friendship
that
had
come
into
his
life
now
excitedly
plunging
down
the
foam
of
rapids
in
the
exhilaration
of
his
liberty
now
proceeding
with
steady
current
at
the
thought
of
the
weeks
of
unremitting
industry
at
a
beloved
task
that
lay
in
front
of
him
he
could
form
no
definite
image
out
of
these
which
should
represent
his
ordinary
day
it
was
all
lost
in
a
bright
haze
through
which
its
shape
was
but
faintly
discernible
but
life
lay
in
front
of
him
with
promise
a
thing
to
be
embraced
and
greeted
with
welcome
and
eager
hands
instead
of
being
a
mere
marsh
through
which
he
had
to
plod
with
labouring
steps
a
business
to
be
gone
about
without
joy
and
without
conviction
in
its
being
worth
while
he
wondered
for
a
moment
as
he
rose
to
go
to
bed
what
his
feelings
would
have
been
if
at
the
end
of
his
performance
on
the
and
voiceless
piano
falbe
had
said
i
m
sorry
but
i
can
t
do
anything
with
as
he
knew
falbe
intended
for
the
future
only
to
take
a
few
pupils
and
chiefly
devote
himself
to
his
own
practice
with
a
view
to
emerging
as
a
the
next
winter
and
as
michael
had
sat
down
he
remembered
telling
himself
that
there
was
really
not
the
slightest
chance
of
his
friend
accepting
him
as
a
pupil
he
did
not
intend
that
this
rejection
should
make
the
smallest
difference
to
his
aim
but
he
knew
that
he
would
start
his
work
under
the
tremendous
handicap
of
falbe
not
believing
that
he
had
it
in
him
to
play
and
under
the
disappointment
of
not
enjoying
the
added
intimacy
which
work
with
and
for
falbe
would
give
him
then
he
had
engaged
in
this
tussle
with
refractory
notes
till
he
quite
lost
himself
in
what
he
was
playing
and
thought
no
more
either
of
falbe
or
the
piano
but
only
of
what
the
melody
meant
to
him
but
at
the
end
when
he
came
to
himself
again
and
sat
with
dropped
hands
waiting
for
falbe
s
verdict
he
remembered
how
his
heart
seemed
to
hang
poised
until
it
came
he
had
rehearsed
again
to
himself
his
fixed
determination
that
he
would
play
and
could
play
whatever
his
friend
might
think
about
it
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
waited
with
a
greater
suspense
than
he
had
ever
known
in
his
life
before
for
that
verdict
to
be
made
known
to
him
next
day
came
their
journey
to
munich
and
the
installation
in
the
best
hotel
in
europe
here
michael
was
host
and
the
economy
which
he
practised
when
he
had
only
himself
to
provide
for
and
which
made
him
go
when
travelling
was
as
usual
completely
abandoned
now
that
the
pleasure
of
hospitality
was
his
he
engaged
at
once
the
best
double
suite
of
rooms
that
the
hotel
contained
two
bedrooms
with
bathrooms
and
an
admirable
looking
spaciously
out
on
to
the
square
and
with
brusque
decision
silenced
falbe
s
attempted
remonstrance
don
t
interfere
with
my
show
please
he
had
said
and
proceeded
to
inquire
about
a
piano
to
be
sent
in
for
the
week
then
he
turned
to
his
friend
again
oh
we
are
going
to
enjoy
ourselves
he
said
with
an
irresistible
sincerity
tristan
und
isolde
was
given
on
the
third
day
of
their
stay
there
and
falbe
reading
the
morning
german
paper
found
news
the
kaiser
has
arrived
he
said
there
s
a
truce
in
the
army
manoeuvres
for
a
couple
of
days
and
he
has
come
to
be
present
at
tristan
this
evening
he
s
travelled
three
hundred
miles
to
get
here
and
will
go
back
the
you
michael
looked
up
with
some
slight
anxiety
ought
i
to
write
my
name
or
anything
he
asked
he
has
stayed
several
times
with
my
has
he
but
i
don
t
suppose
it
matters
the
visit
is
a
incognito
that
s
his
way
god
be
with
the
he
added
well
i
shan
t
said
michael
but
it
would
shock
my
father
dreadfully
if
he
knew
the
kaiser
looks
on
him
as
the
type
and
model
of
the
english
michael
crunched
one
of
the
inimitable
breakfast
rusks
in
his
teeth
lord
what
a
day
we
had
when
he
was
at
ashbridge
last
year
he
said
we
began
at
eight
with
a
review
of
the
suffolk
yeomanry
then
we
had
a
pheasant
shoot
from
eleven
till
three
then
the
emperor
had
out
a
steam
launch
and
careered
up
and
down
the
river
till
six
asking
a
thousand
questions
about
the
tides
and
the
currents
and
the
navigable
channels
then
he
lectured
us
on
the
family
portraits
till
dinner
after
dinner
there
was
a
concert
at
which
he
conducted
the
song
to
aegir
and
then
there
was
a
fandango
by
the
tenants
on
the
lawn
he
was
on
his
holiday
you
must
i
heard
the
song
to
aegir
once
remarked
falbe
with
a
perfectly
level
intonation
i
was
er
luckier
said
michael
politely
because
on
that
occasion
i
heard
it
twice
it
was
and
what
did
it
sound
like
the
second
time
asked
falbe
much
as
before
said
michael
the
advent
of
the
emperor
had
put
the
whole
town
in
a
ferment
though
the
visit
was
quite
incognito
an
enormous
military
staff
which
had
been
poured
into
the
town
might
have
led
the
thoughtful
to
suspect
the
kaiser
s
presence
even
if
it
had
not
been
announced
in
the
largest
type
in
the
papers
and
marchings
and
of
troops
and
sudden
bursts
of
national
airs
proclaimed
the
august
presence
he
held
an
informal
review
of
certain
bavarian
troops
not
out
for
manoeuvres
in
the
morning
visited
the
sculpture
gallery
and
pinacothek
in
the
afternoon
and
when
hermann
and
michael
went
up
to
the
theatre
they
found
rows
of
soldiers
drawn
up
and
inside
unusual
decorations
over
a
section
of
stalls
which
had
been
removed
and
was
converted
into
an
enormous
box
this
was
in
the
centre
of
the
first
tier
nearly
at
right
angles
to
where
they
sat
in
the
front
row
of
the
same
tier
and
when
with
military
punctuality
the
procession
of
uniforms
headed
by
the
emperor
filed
in
the
whole
of
the
crowded
house
stood
up
and
broke
into
a
roar
of
recognition
and
loyalty
for
a
minute
or
perhaps
more
the
emperor
stood
facing
the
house
with
his
hand
raised
in
salute
a
figure
the
uprightness
of
which
made
him
look
tall
his
brilliant
uniform
was
ablaze
with
decorations
he
seemed
every
inch
a
soldier
and
a
leader
of
men
for
that
minute
he
stood
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
left
stern
and
almost
frowning
with
no
shadow
of
a
smile
playing
on
the
lips
above
which
his
moustache
was
brushed
upwards
in
two
stiff
protuberances
towards
his
eyes
he
was
there
just
then
not
to
see
but
to
be
seen
his
incognito
was
momentarily
in
abeyance
and
he
stood
forth
the
supreme
head
of
his
people
the
war
lord
who
had
come
that
day
from
the
field
to
which
he
would
return
across
half
germany
tomorrow
it
was
an
impressive
and
dignified
moment
and
michael
heard
falbe
say
to
himself
kaiserlich
kaiserlich
then
it
was
over
the
emperor
sat
down
beckoned
to
two
of
his
officers
who
had
stood
in
a
group
far
at
the
back
of
the
box
to
join
him
and
with
one
on
each
side
he
looked
about
the
house
and
chatted
to
them
he
had
taken
out
his
which
he
adjusted
using
his
right
hand
only
and
looked
this
way
and
that
as
if
incognito
again
he
was
looking
for
friends
in
the
house
once
michael
thought
that
he
looked
rather
long
and
fixedly
in
his
direction
and
then
putting
down
his
glass
he
said
something
to
one
of
the
officers
this
time
clearly
pointing
towards
michael
then
he
gave
some
signal
just
raising
his
hand
towards
the
orchestra
and
immediately
the
lights
were
put
down
the
whole
house
plunged
in
darkness
except
where
the
lamps
in
the
sunk
orchestra
faintly
illuminated
the
base
of
the
curtain
and
the
first
longing
unsatisfied
notes
of
the
prelude
began
the
next
hour
passed
for
michael
in
one
unbroken
mood
of
absorption
the
supreme
moment
of
knowing
the
music
intimately
and
of
never
having
seen
the
opera
before
was
his
and
all
that
he
had
dreamed
of
or
imagined
as
to
the
possibilities
of
music
was
flooded
and
drowned
in
the
thing
itself
you
could
not
say
that
it
was
more
gigantic
than
the
ring
more
human
than
the
meistersingers
more
emotional
than
parsifal
but
it
was
utterly
and
wholly
different
to
anything
else
he
had
ever
seen
or
conjectured
falbe
he
himself
the
thronged
and
silent
theatre
the
emperor
munich
germany
were
all
blotted
out
of
his
consciousness
he
just
watched
as
if
discarnate
the
unrolling
of
the
decrees
of
fate
which
were
to
bring
so
simple
and
overpowering
a
tragedy
on
the
two
who
drained
the
together
and
at
the
end
he
fell
back
in
his
seat
feeling
thrilled
and
tired
exhilarated
and
exhausted
oh
hermann
he
said
what
years
i
ve
wasted
falbe
laughed
you
ve
wasted
more
than
you
know
yet
he
said
hallo
a
very
resplendent
officer
had
come
clanking
down
the
gangway
next
them
he
put
his
heels
together
and
bowed
lord
comber
i
think
he
said
in
excellent
english
michael
roused
himself
yes
he
said
his
imperial
majesty
has
done
me
the
honour
to
desire
you
to
come
and
speak
to
him
he
said
now
said
michael
if
you
will
be
so
good
and
he
stood
aside
for
michael
to
pass
up
the
stairs
in
front
of
him
in
the
wide
corridor
behind
he
joined
him
again
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
as
count
von
bergmann
he
said
and
one
of
his
majesty
s
the
kaiser
always
speaks
with
great
pleasure
of
the
visits
he
has
paid
to
your
father
and
he
saw
you
immediately
he
came
into
the
theatre
if
you
will
permit
me
i
would
advise
you
to
bow
but
not
very
low
respecting
his
majesty
s
incognito
to
seat
yourself
as
soon
as
he
desires
it
and
to
remain
till
he
gives
you
some
speech
of
dismissal
forgive
me
for
going
in
front
of
you
here
i
have
to
introduce
you
to
his
majesty
s
michael
followed
him
down
the
steps
to
the
front
of
the
box
lord
comber
he
said
and
instantly
stood
back
the
emperor
rose
and
held
out
his
hand
and
michael
bowing
over
it
as
he
took
it
felt
himself
seized
in
the
famous
grip
of
steel
of
which
its
owner
as
well
as
its
recipient
was
so
conscious
i
am
much
pleased
to
see
you
lord
comber
said
he
i
could
not
resist
the
pleasure
of
a
little
chat
with
you
about
our
beloved
england
and
your
excellent
father
how
is
he
he
indicated
a
chair
to
michael
who
as
advised
instantly
took
it
though
the
emperor
remained
a
moment
longer
standing
i
left
him
in
very
good
health
your
majesty
said
michael
ah
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
i
desire
you
to
convey
to
him
my
friendliest
greetings
and
to
your
mother
also
i
well
remember
my
last
visit
to
his
house
above
the
tidal
estuary
at
ashbridge
and
i
hope
it
may
not
be
very
long
before
i
have
the
opportunity
to
be
in
england
he
spoke
in
a
voice
that
seemed
rather
hoarse
and
tired
but
his
manner
expressed
the
most
courteous
cordiality
his
face
which
had
been
as
still
as
a
statue
s
when
he
showed
himself
to
the
house
was
now
never
in
repose
for
a
moment
he
kept
turning
his
head
which
he
carried
very
upright
this
way
and
that
as
he
spoke
now
he
would
catch
sight
of
someone
in
the
audience
to
whom
he
directed
his
glance
now
he
would
peer
over
the
edge
of
the
low
balustrade
now
look
at
the
group
of
officers
who
stood
apart
at
the
back
of
the
box
his
whole
demeanour
suggested
a
nervous
condition
the
restlessness
of
it
was
that
of
a
man
overstrained
who
had
lost
the
capability
of
being
tranquil
now
he
frowned
now
he
smiled
but
never
for
a
moment
was
he
quiet
then
he
launched
a
perfect
hailstorm
of
questions
at
michael
to
the
answers
to
which
there
was
scarcely
time
for
more
than
a
monosyllable
in
reply
he
listened
with
an
eager
and
a
suspicious
attention
they
were
concerned
at
first
with
all
sorts
of
subjects
inquired
if
michael
had
been
at
baireuth
what
he
was
going
to
do
after
the
munich
festival
was
over
if
he
had
english
friends
here
he
inquired
falbe
s
name
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
through
his
glasses
and
desired
to
know
more
about
him
then
learning
he
was
a
teacher
of
the
piano
in
england
and
had
a
sister
who
sang
he
expressed
great
satisfaction
i
like
to
see
my
subjects
when
there
is
no
need
for
their
services
at
home
he
said
learning
about
other
lands
and
bringing
also
to
other
lands
the
culture
of
the
fatherland
even
as
it
always
gives
me
pleasure
to
see
the
english
here
strengthening
by
the
study
of
the
arts
the
bonds
that
bind
our
two
great
nations
together
you
english
must
learn
to
understand
us
and
our
great
mission
just
as
we
must
learn
to
understand
then
the
questions
became
more
specialised
and
concerned
the
state
of
things
in
england
he
laughed
over
the
disturbances
created
by
the
suffragettes
was
eager
to
hear
what
politicians
thought
about
the
state
of
things
in
ireland
made
specific
inquiries
about
the
territorial
force
asked
about
the
navy
the
state
of
the
drama
in
london
the
coal
strike
which
was
threatened
in
yorkshire
then
suddenly
he
put
a
series
of
personal
questions
and
you
you
are
in
the
guards
i
think
he
said
no
sir
i
have
just
resigned
my
commission
said
michael
why
why
is
that
have
many
of
your
officers
been
resigning
i
am
studying
music
your
majesty
said
michael
i
am
glad
to
see
you
came
to
germany
to
do
it
berlin
you
ought
to
spend
a
couple
of
months
in
berlin
perhaps
you
are
thinking
of
doing
he
turned
round
quickly
to
one
of
his
staff
who
had
approached
him
well
what
is
it
he
said
count
von
bergmann
bowed
low
the
he
said
humbly
craves
to
know
whether
it
is
your
majesty
s
pleasure
that
the
opera
shall
the
kaiser
laughed
there
lord
comber
he
said
you
see
how
i
am
ordered
about
they
wish
to
cut
short
my
conversation
with
you
yes
bergmann
we
will
go
on
you
will
remain
with
me
lord
comber
for
this
immediately
after
the
lights
were
lowered
again
the
curtain
rose
and
a
most
distracting
hour
began
for
michael
his
neighbour
was
never
still
for
a
single
moment
now
he
would
shift
in
his
chair
now
with
his
hand
he
would
beat
time
on
the
red
velvet
balustrade
in
front
of
him
and
a
stream
of
whispered
appreciation
and
criticism
flowed
from
him
they
are
taking
the
opening
scene
a
little
too
slow
he
said
i
shall
call
the
director
s
attention
to
that
but
that
crescendo
is
well
done
yes
that
is
most
effective
the
shawl
observe
the
beautiful
lines
into
which
the
shawl
falls
as
she
waves
it
that
is
wonderful
a
very
impressive
entry
ah
but
they
should
not
cross
the
stage
yet
it
is
more
effective
if
they
remain
longer
there
brangane
sings
finely
she
warns
them
that
the
doom
is
he
gave
a
little
giggle
which
reminded
michael
of
his
father
brangane
is
playing
gooseberry
as
you
say
in
england
he
said
a
big
gooseberry
is
she
not
ah
bravo
bravo
wunderschon
yes
enter
king
mark
from
his
hunting
very
fine
say
i
was
particularly
pleased
with
the
entry
of
king
mark
bergmann
a
wonderful
act
wagner
never
touched
greater
at
the
end
the
emperor
rose
and
again
held
out
his
hand
i
am
pleased
to
have
seen
you
lord
comber
he
said
do
not
forget
my
message
to
your
father
and
take
my
advice
and
come
to
berlin
in
the
winter
we
are
always
pleased
to
see
the
english
in
as
michael
left
the
box
he
ran
into
the
who
had
been
summoned
to
get
a
few
hints
he
went
back
to
join
falbe
in
a
state
of
republican
irritation
which
the
honour
that
had
been
done
him
did
not
at
all
assuage
there
was
an
hour
s
interval
before
the
third
act
and
the
two
drove
back
to
their
hotel
to
dine
there
but
michael
found
his
friend
wholly
unsympathetic
with
his
chagrin
to
him
it
was
quite
clear
the
disappointment
of
not
having
been
able
to
attend
very
closely
to
the
second
act
of
tristan
was
negligible
compared
to
the
cause
that
had
occasioned
it
it
was
possible
for
the
ordinary
mortal
to
see
tristan
over
and
over
again
but
to
converse
with
the
kaiser
was
a
thing
outside
the
range
of
the
average
man
and
again
in
this
interval
as
during
the
act
itself
michael
was
bombarded
with
questions
what
did
the
kaiser
say
did
he
remember
ashbridge
did
michael
twice
receive
the
iron
grip
did
the
say
anything
about
the
manoeuvres
did
he
look
tired
or
was
it
only
the
light
above
his
head
that
made
him
appear
so
haggard
even
his
opinion
about
the
opera
was
of
interest
did
he
express
approval
this
was
too
much
for
michael
my
dear
hermann
he
said
we
alluded
very
cautiously
to
the
song
to
aegir
this
morning
and
delicately
remarked
that
you
had
heard
it
once
and
i
twice
how
can
you
care
what
his
opinion
of
this
opera
is
falbe
shook
his
handsome
head
and
gesticulated
with
his
fine
hands
you
don
t
understand
he
said
you
have
just
been
talking
to
him
himself
i
long
to
hear
his
every
word
and
intonation
there
is
the
personality
which
to
us
means
so
much
in
which
is
summed
up
all
germany
it
is
as
if
i
had
spoken
to
rule
britannia
herself
would
you
not
be
interested
there
is
no
one
in
the
world
who
is
to
his
country
what
the
kaiser
is
to
us
when
you
told
me
he
had
stayed
at
ashbridge
i
was
thrilled
but
i
was
ashamed
lest
you
should
think
me
snobbish
which
indeed
i
am
not
but
now
i
am
past
being
he
poured
out
a
glass
of
wine
and
drank
it
with
a
hoch
in
his
hand
lies
peace
and
war
he
said
it
is
as
he
pleases
the
emperor
and
his
chancellor
can
make
germany
do
exactly
what
they
choose
and
if
the
chancellor
does
not
agree
with
the
emperor
the
emperor
can
appoint
one
who
does
that
is
what
it
comes
to
that
is
why
he
is
as
vast
as
germany
itself
the
reichstag
but
advises
where
he
is
concerned
have
you
no
imagination
michael
europe
lies
in
the
hand
that
shook
michael
laughed
i
suppose
i
must
have
no
imagination
he
said
i
don
t
picture
it
even
now
when
you
point
it
falbe
pointed
an
impressive
forefinger
but
for
him
he
said
england
and
germany
would
have
been
at
each
other
s
throats
over
the
business
at
agadir
he
held
the
warhounds
in
leash
he
their
master
who
made
oh
he
made
them
anyhow
said
michael
naturally
it
is
his
business
to
be
ready
for
any
attack
on
the
part
of
those
who
are
jealous
at
our
power
the
whole
fatherland
is
a
sword
in
his
hand
which
he
sheathes
it
would
long
ago
have
leaped
from
the
scabbard
but
for
against
whom
asked
michael
who
is
the
enemy
falbe
hesitated
there
is
no
enemy
at
present
he
said
but
the
enemy
potentially
is
any
who
tries
to
thwart
our
peaceful
suddenly
the
whole
subject
tasted
bitter
to
michael
he
recalled
instinctively
the
emperor
s
great
curiosity
to
be
informed
on
english
topics
by
the
ordinary
englishman
with
whom
he
had
acquaintance
oh
let
s
drop
it
he
said
i
really
didn
t
come
to
munich
to
talk
politics
of
which
i
know
nothing
falbe
nodded
that
is
what
i
have
said
to
you
before
he
remarked
you
are
the
most
of
the
nations
did
he
speak
of
england
yes
of
his
beloved
england
said
michael
he
was
extremely
cordial
about
our
good
i
like
that
said
falbe
briskly
and
he
recommended
me
to
spend
two
months
in
berlin
in
the
winter
added
michael
sliding
off
on
to
other
topics
falbe
smiled
i
like
that
less
he
said
since
that
will
mean
you
will
not
be
in
but
i
didn
t
commit
myself
said
michael
smiling
back
though
i
can
say
beloved
germany
with
equal
falbe
got
up
i
would
wish
that
that
you
were
kaiser
of
england
he
said
god
forbid
said
michael
i
should
not
have
time
to
play
the
during
the
next
day
or
two
michael
often
found
himself
chipping
at
the
so
to
speak
of
this
conversation
and
falbe
s
revealed
attitude
towards
his
country
and
in
particular
towards
its
supreme
head
it
seemed
to
him
a
wonderful
and
an
enviable
thing
that
anyone
could
be
so
thoroughly
english
as
falbe
certainly
was
in
his
ordinary
everyday
life
and
that
yet
at
the
back
of
this
there
should
lie
so
profound
a
patriotism
towards
another
country
and
so
profound
a
reverence
to
its
ruler
in
his
general
outlook
on
life
his
friend
appeared
to
be
entirely
of
one
blood
with
himself
yet
now
on
two
or
three
occasions
a
chance
spark
had
lit
up
this
teutonic
beacon
to
michael
this
mixture
of
nationalities
seemed
to
be
a
wonderful
gift
it
implied
a
widening
of
one
s
sympathies
and
outlook
a
larger
comprehension
of
life
than
was
possible
to
any
of
undiluted
blood
for
himself
like
most
young
englishmen
of
his
day
he
was
not
conscious
of
any
tremendous
sense
of
patriotism
like
this
somewhere
deep
down
in
him
he
supposed
there
might
be
a
source
a
well
of
english
waters
which
some
explosion
in
his
nature
might
cause
to
flood
him
entirely
but
such
an
idea
was
purely
hypothetical
he
did
not
in
fact
look
forward
to
such
a
bouleversement
as
being
a
possible
contingency
but
with
falbe
it
was
different
quite
a
small
cause
like
the
sight
of
the
rhine
at
cologne
or
a
bavarian
village
at
sunset
or
the
fact
of
a
friend
having
talked
with
the
emperor
was
sufficient
to
make
his
innate
patriotism
find
outlet
in
impassioned
speech
he
wondered
vaguely
whether
falbe
s
explanation
of
this
namely
that
nationally
the
english
were
prosperous
comfortable
and
insouciant
was
perhaps
sound
it
seemed
that
the
notion
was
not
wholly
foundationless
chapter
vi
michael
had
been
practising
all
the
morning
of
a
dark
november
day
had
eaten
a
couple
of
sandwiches
standing
in
front
of
his
fire
and
observed
with
some
secret
satisfaction
that
the
fog
which
had
lifted
for
an
hour
had
come
down
on
the
town
again
in
earnest
and
that
it
was
only
reasonable
to
dismiss
the
possibility
of
going
out
and
spend
the
afternoon
as
he
had
spent
the
morning
but
he
permitted
himself
a
few
minutes
relaxation
as
he
smoked
his
cigarette
and
sat
down
by
the
window
looking
out
in
lucretian
mood
on
to
the
very
dispiriting
conditions
that
prevailed
in
the
street
though
it
was
still
only
between
one
and
two
in
the
afternoon
the
densest
gloom
prevailed
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
the
outlines
even
of
the
houses
across
the
street
and
the
only
evidence
that
he
was
not
in
some
desert
spot
lay
in
the
fact
of
a
few
twinkling
lights
looking
incredibly
remote
from
the
windows
opposite
and
the
below
traffic
seemed
to
be
at
a
standstill
the
accustomed
roar
from
piccadilly
was
dumb
and
he
looked
out
on
to
a
silent
and
world
this
isolation
from
all
his
fellows
and
from
the
chances
of
being
disturbed
it
may
be
added
gave
him
a
sense
of
extreme
satisfaction
he
wanted
his
piano
but
no
intrusive
presence
he
liked
the
sensation
of
being
shut
up
in
his
own
industrious
citadel
secure
from
interruption
during
the
last
two
months
and
a
half
since
his
return
from
munich
he
had
experienced
greater
happiness
had
burned
with
a
stronger
zest
for
life
than
during
the
whole
of
his
previous
existence
not
only
had
he
been
working
at
that
which
he
believed
he
was
fitted
for
and
which
gave
him
the
stimulus
which
one
way
or
another
is
essential
to
all
good
work
but
he
had
been
thrown
among
people
who
were
similarly
employed
with
whom
he
had
this
great
common
ground
of
kinship
in
ambition
and
aim
no
more
were
the
days
too
long
from
being
but
with
work
with
which
he
had
no
sympathy
and
diversions
that
gave
him
no
pleasure
none
held
sufficient
hours
for
all
that
he
wanted
to
put
into
it
and
in
this
busy
atmosphere
where
his
own
studies
took
so
much
of
his
time
and
energy
and
where
everybody
else
was
in
some
way
similarly
employed
that
dismal
which
so
drearily
looked
on
himself
shuffling
along
through
fruitless
uncongenial
days
was
cracking
off
him
as
the
chestnut
husk
cracks
when
the
kernel
within
swells
and
ripens
apart
from
his
work
the
centre
of
his
life
was
certainly
the
household
of
the
falbes
where
the
brother
and
sister
lived
with
their
mother
she
turned
out
to
be
in
a
rather
remote
manner
one
of
us
and
had
about
her
very
faint
and
dim
like
an
antique
lavender
bag
the
odour
of
ashbridge
she
lived
like
the
lilies
of
the
field
without
toiling
or
spinning
either
literally
or
with
the
more
figurative
work
of
the
mind
indeed
she
can
scarcely
be
said
to
have
had
any
mind
at
all
for
as
with
drugs
she
had
sapped
it
away
by
a
practically
unremitting
perusal
of
all
the
fiction
that
makes
the
average
reader
wonder
why
it
was
written
in
fact
she
supplied
the
answer
to
that
perplexing
question
since
it
was
clearly
written
for
her
she
was
not
in
the
least
excited
by
these
tales
any
more
than
the
human
race
are
excited
by
the
oxygen
in
the
air
but
she
could
not
live
without
them
she
subscribed
to
three
lending
libraries
which
by
this
time
had
probably
learned
her
tastes
for
if
she
ever
by
embarked
on
a
volume
which
ever
so
faintly
adumbrated
the
realities
of
life
she
instantly
returned
it
as
she
found
it
painful
and
naturally
she
did
not
wish
to
be
pained
this
did
not
however
prevent
her
reading
those
that
dealt
with
amiable
young
men
who
fell
in
love
with
amiable
young
women
and
were
for
the
moment
sundered
by
adventuresses
or
moneylenders
for
those
she
found
not
painful
but
powerful
and
could
often
remember
where
she
had
got
to
in
them
which
otherwise
was
not
usually
the
case
she
wore
a
good
deal
of
lace
spoke
in
a
tired
voice
and
must
certainly
have
been
of
the
type
called
sweetly
pretty
some
quarter
of
a
century
ago
she
drank
hot
water
with
her
meals
and
continually
reminded
michael
of
his
own
mother
sylvia
and
hermann
certainly
did
all
that
could
be
done
for
her
in
other
words
they
invariably
saw
that
her
water
was
hot
and
her
stock
of
novels
replenished
but
when
that
was
accomplished
there
really
appeared
to
be
little
more
that
could
be
done
for
her
her
presence
in
a
room
counted
for
about
as
much
as
a
rather
powerful
shadow
on
the
wall
unexplained
by
any
solid
object
which
could
have
made
it
appear
there
but
most
of
the
day
she
spent
in
her
own
room
which
was
furnished
exactly
in
accordance
with
her
twilight
existence
there
was
a
there
which
she
never
used
several
low
one
of
which
she
was
always
using
by
each
of
which
was
a
small
table
on
to
which
she
could
put
the
book
that
she
was
at
the
moment
engaged
on
lace
hangings
of
the
sort
that
prevent
anybody
either
seeing
in
or
out
obscured
the
windows
and
for
decoration
there
were
china
figures
on
the
plates
on
the
walls
and
a
couple
of
easels
draped
with
chiffon
on
which
stood
enlarged
photographs
of
her
husband
and
her
children
there
was
it
may
be
added
nothing
in
the
least
pathetic
about
her
for
as
far
as
could
be
ascertained
she
had
everything
she
wanted
in
fact
from
the
standpoint
of
commonsense
hers
was
the
most
successful
existence
for
knowing
what
she
liked
she
passed
her
entire
life
in
its
accomplishment
the
only
thing
that
caused
her
emotion
was
the
energy
and
vitality
of
her
two
children
and
even
then
that
emotion
was
but
a
mild
surprise
when
she
recollected
how
tremendous
a
worker
and
boisterous
a
gourmand
of
life
was
her
late
husband
on
the
anniversary
of
whose
death
she
always
sat
all
day
without
reading
any
novels
at
all
but
devoted
what
was
left
of
her
mind
to
the
contemplation
of
nothing
at
all
she
had
married
him
because
for
some
inscrutable
reason
he
insisted
on
it
and
she
had
been
resigned
to
his
death
as
to
everything
else
that
had
ever
happened
to
her
all
her
life
in
fact
she
had
been
of
that
unchangeable
drab
quality
in
emotional
affairs
which
is
characteristic
of
advanced
when
there
are
no
great
joys
or
sorrows
to
look
back
on
and
no
expectation
for
the
future
she
had
always
had
something
of
the
indestructible
quality
of
frail
things
like
thistledown
or
cottonwool
violence
and
explosion
that
would
blow
strong
and
distinct
organisms
to
atoms
only
puffed
her
a
yard
or
two
away
where
she
alighted
again
without
shock
instead
of
injuring
or
annihilating
her
yet
in
the
inexplicable
ways
of
love
sylvia
and
her
brother
not
only
did
what
could
be
done
for
her
but
regarded
her
with
the
tenderest
affection
what
that
love
lived
on
what
was
its
daily
food
would
be
hard
to
guess
were
it
not
that
love
lives
on
itself
the
rest
of
the
house
apart
from
the
vacuum
of
falbe
s
rooms
conducted
itself
so
it
seemed
to
michael
at
the
highest
possible
pressure
sylvia
and
her
brother
were
both
far
too
busy
to
be
restless
and
if
on
the
one
hand
falbe
s
remote
impenetrable
life
was
inexplicable
not
less
inexplicable
was
the
rage
for
living
that
possessed
the
other
two
from
morning
till
night
and
on
sundays
from
night
till
morning
life
proceeded
at
top
speed
as
regards
household
arrangements
which
were
all
in
sylvia
s
hands
there
were
three
fixed
points
in
the
day
that
is
to
say
that
there
was
lunch
for
falbe
and
anybody
else
who
happened
to
be
there
at
one
tea
in
falbe
s
at
five
and
dinner
at
eight
these
meals
falbe
always
breakfasted
in
her
bedroom
were
served
with
quiet
decorum
apart
from
them
anybody
who
required
anything
consulted
the
cook
personally
hermann
for
instance
would
have
spent
the
morning
at
his
piano
in
the
vast
studio
at
the
back
of
their
house
in
maidstone
crescent
and
not
arrived
at
the
fact
that
it
was
lunch
time
till
perhaps
three
in
the
afternoon
unless
then
he
settled
to
do
without
lunch
altogether
he
must
forage
for
himself
or
sylvia
having
to
sing
at
a
concert
at
eight
would
return
famished
and
exultant
about
ten
she
would
then
proceed
to
provide
herself
unless
she
supped
elsewhere
with
a
plate
of
eggs
and
bacon
or
anything
else
that
was
easily
accessible
it
was
not
from
preference
that
these
haphazard
methods
were
adopted
but
since
they
only
kept
two
servants
it
was
clear
that
a
couple
of
women
however
willing
could
not
possibly
cope
with
so
irregular
a
commissariat
in
addition
to
the
series
of
fixed
hours
and
the
rest
of
the
household
work
as
it
was
two
splendidly
efficient
persons
one
german
the
other
english
had
filled
the
posts
of
parlourmaid
and
cook
for
the
last
eight
years
and
regarded
themselves
and
were
regarded
as
members
of
the
family
lucas
the
parlourmaid
indeed
from
the
intense
interest
she
took
in
the
conversation
at
table
could
not
always
resist
joining
in
it
and
was
apt
to
correct
hermann
or
his
sister
if
she
detected
an
inaccuracy
in
their
statements
no
miss
sylvia
she
would
say
it
was
on
thursday
not
wednesday
and
then
recollecting
herself
would
add
beg
your
pardon
in
this
milieu
as
new
to
michael
as
some
suddenly
discovered
country
he
found
himself
at
once
plunged
and
treated
with
instant
friendly
intimacy
hermann
so
he
supposed
must
have
given
him
a
good
character
for
he
was
made
welcome
before
he
could
have
had
time
to
make
any
impression
for
himself
as
hermann
s
friend
on
the
first
occasion
of
his
visiting
the
house
for
the
purpose
of
his
music
lesson
he
had
stopped
to
lunch
afterwards
where
he
met
sylvia
and
was
in
the
presence
of
you
could
hardly
call
it
more
than
that
their
mother
falbe
had
faded
away
in
some
fashion
soon
after
but
it
was
evident
that
he
was
intended
to
do
no
such
thing
and
they
had
gone
into
the
studio
already
comrades
and
michael
had
chiefly
listened
while
the
other
two
had
violent
and
friendly
discussions
on
every
subject
under
the
sun
then
hermann
happened
to
sit
down
at
the
piano
and
played
a
chopin
etude
pianissimo
prestissimo
with
that
just
made
the
notes
to
sound
and
no
more
and
sylvia
told
him
that
he
was
getting
it
better
and
then
sylvia
sang
who
is
sylvia
and
hermann
told
her
that
she
shouldn
t
have
eaten
so
much
lunch
or
shouldn
t
have
sung
and
then
by
transitions
that
michael
could
not
recollect
they
played
the
hailstone
chorus
out
of
israel
in
egypt
or
at
any
rate
reproduced
the
spirit
of
it
and
both
sang
at
the
top
of
their
voices
then
as
usually
happened
in
the
afternoon
two
or
three
friends
dropped
in
and
though
these
were
all
intimate
with
their
hosts
michael
had
no
impression
of
being
out
in
the
cold
or
among
strangers
and
when
he
left
he
felt
as
if
he
had
been
stretching
out
chilly
hands
to
the
fire
and
that
the
fire
was
always
burning
there
ready
for
him
to
heat
himself
at
with
its
welcoming
flames
and
core
of
sincere
warmth
whenever
he
felt
so
disposed
at
first
he
had
let
himself
do
this
much
less
often
than
he
would
have
liked
for
the
shyness
of
years
his
modesty
at
his
own
want
of
charm
and
lightness
was
a
barrier
in
his
way
he
was
in
spite
of
his
intimacy
with
hermann
desperately
afraid
of
being
tiresome
of
checking
by
his
presence
as
he
had
so
often
felt
himself
do
before
the
ease
and
high
spirits
of
others
but
by
degrees
this
broke
down
he
realised
that
he
was
now
among
those
with
whom
he
had
that
kinship
of
the
mind
and
of
tastes
which
makes
the
foundation
on
which
friendship
and
whatever
friendship
may
ripen
into
is
securely
built
never
did
the
simplicity
and
sincerity
of
their
welcome
fail
the
cordiality
which
greeted
him
was
always
his
he
felt
that
it
was
intended
that
he
should
be
at
home
there
just
as
much
as
he
cared
to
be
the
six
working
days
of
the
week
however
were
as
a
rule
too
full
both
for
the
falbes
and
for
michael
to
do
more
than
have
apart
from
the
music
lessons
flying
glimpses
of
each
other
for
the
day
was
taken
up
with
work
concerts
and
opera
occurred
often
in
the
evening
and
the
shuttles
of
london
took
their
threads
in
divergent
directions
but
on
sunday
the
house
at
maidstone
crescent
ceased
as
hermann
said
to
be
a
junction
and
became
a
temporary
terminus
we
burst
from
our
chrysalis
in
fact
he
said
if
you
find
it
clearer
to
understand
this
way
we
burst
from
our
chrysalis
and
become
a
caterpillar
do
chrysalides
become
caterpillars
we
do
anyhow
if
you
come
about
eight
you
will
find
food
if
you
come
later
you
will
also
find
food
of
a
sketchier
kind
people
have
a
habit
of
dropping
in
on
sunday
evening
there
s
music
if
anyone
feels
inclined
to
make
any
and
if
they
don
t
they
are
made
to
some
people
come
early
others
late
and
they
stop
to
breakfast
if
they
wish
it
s
a
gaudeamus
you
know
a
jolly
a
jamboree
one
has
to
relax
michael
felt
all
his
old
unfitness
for
dreadful
crowds
return
to
him
oh
i
m
so
bad
at
that
sort
of
thing
he
said
i
am
a
frightful
hermann
sat
down
on
the
treble
part
of
his
piano
that
s
the
most
conceited
thing
i
ve
heard
you
say
yet
he
remarked
nobody
will
pay
any
attention
to
you
you
won
t
kill
anybody
s
joy
also
it
s
rather
rude
of
i
didn
t
mean
to
be
rude
said
michael
then
we
must
suppose
you
were
rude
by
accident
that
is
the
worst
sort
of
i
m
sorry
i
ll
come
said
michael
that
s
right
you
might
even
find
yourself
enjoying
it
by
accident
you
know
if
you
don
t
you
can
go
away
there
s
music
sylvia
sings
quite
seriously
sometimes
and
other
people
sing
or
bring
violins
and
those
who
don
t
like
it
talk
and
then
we
get
less
serious
have
a
try
michael
see
if
you
can
t
be
less
serious
michael
slipped
despairingly
from
his
seat
if
only
i
knew
how
he
said
i
believe
my
nurse
never
taught
me
to
play
only
to
remember
that
i
was
a
little
gentleman
all
the
same
when
i
am
with
you
or
with
my
cousin
francis
i
can
manage
it
to
a
certain
falbe
looked
at
him
encouragingly
oh
you
re
getting
on
he
said
you
take
yourself
more
for
granted
than
you
used
to
i
remember
you
when
you
used
to
be
polite
on
purpose
it
s
doing
things
on
purpose
that
makes
one
serious
if
you
ever
play
the
fool
on
purpose
you
instantly
cease
playing
the
is
that
it
said
michael
yes
of
course
so
come
on
sunday
and
forget
all
about
it
except
coming
and
now
do
you
mind
going
away
i
want
to
put
in
a
couple
of
hours
before
lunch
you
know
what
to
practise
till
tuesday
don
t
you
that
was
the
first
sunday
evening
that
michael
had
spent
with
his
friends
after
that
up
till
this
present
date
in
november
he
had
not
missed
a
single
one
of
those
gatherings
they
consisted
almost
entirely
of
men
and
of
the
men
there
were
many
types
and
many
ages
actors
and
artists
musicians
and
authors
were
indiscriminately
mingled
it
was
the
strangest
conglomeration
of
diverse
interests
but
one
interest
so
it
seemed
to
michael
bound
them
all
together
they
were
all
doing
in
their
different
lives
the
things
they
most
delighted
in
doing
there
was
the
key
that
unlocked
all
the
locks
namely
the
enjoyment
that
inspired
their
work
the
freemasonry
of
art
and
the
freemasonry
of
the
eager
mind
that
looks
out
without
verdict
but
with
only
expectation
and
delight
in
experiment
passed
like
an
open
secret
among
them
secret
because
none
spoke
of
it
open
because
it
was
so
transparently
obvious
and
since
this
was
so
every
member
of
that
heterogeneous
community
had
a
respect
for
his
companions
the
fact
that
they
were
there
together
showed
that
they
had
all
passed
this
initiation
and
knew
what
for
them
life
meant
very
soon
after
dinner
all
sitting
accommodation
other
than
the
floor
was
occupied
but
then
the
floor
held
the
later
comers
and
the
smoke
from
many
cigarettes
and
the
babble
of
many
voices
made
a
incense
before
the
altar
dedicated
to
the
gods
that
inspire
all
enjoyable
endeavour
then
sylvia
sang
and
both
those
who
cared
to
hear
exquisite
singing
and
those
who
did
not
were
alike
silent
for
this
was
a
prayer
to
the
gods
they
all
worshipped
and
falbe
played
and
there
was
a
quartet
of
strings
after
that
less
serious
affairs
held
the
rooms
an
eminent
actor
was
pleased
to
parody
another
eminent
actor
who
was
also
present
this
led
to
a
scene
in
which
each
caricatured
the
other
and
a
french
poet
did
gymnastic
feats
on
the
floor
and
upset
a
tray
of
and
a
german
conductor
fluffed
out
his
hair
and
died
like
marguerite
and
when
in
the
earlier
hours
of
the
morning
part
of
the
guests
had
gone
away
and
part
were
broiling
ham
in
the
kitchen
sylvia
sang
again
quite
seriously
and
michael
in
hermann
s
absence
volunteered
to
play
her
accompaniment
for
her
she
stood
behind
him
and
by
a
finger
on
his
shoulder
directed
him
in
the
way
she
would
have
him
go
michael
found
himself
suddenly
and
inexplicably
understanding
this
her
finger
by
its
pressure
or
its
light
tapping
seemed
to
him
to
speak
in
a
language
that
he
found
himself
familiar
with
and
he
slowed
down
stroking
the
notes
or
quickened
with
staccato
touch
as
she
wordlessly
directed
him
out
of
all
these
things
which
were
but
trivialities
pleasant
unthinking
hours
for
all
else
concerned
several
points
stood
out
for
michael
points
new
and
illuminating
the
first
was
the
simplicity
of
it
all
the
spontaneousness
with
which
pleasure
was
born
if
only
you
took
off
your
clothes
so
to
speak
and
left
them
on
the
bank
while
you
jumped
in
all
his
life
he
had
buttoned
his
jacket
and
crammed
his
hat
on
to
his
head
the
second
was
the
sense
indefinable
but
certain
that
hermann
and
sylvia
between
them
were
the
high
priests
of
this
memorable
orgie
he
himself
had
met
at
dreadful
solemn
evenings
when
lady
ashbridge
and
his
father
stood
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
the
two
eminent
actors
who
had
romped
and
found
them
exceedingly
stately
personages
just
as
no
doubt
they
had
found
him
an
icy
and
awkward
young
man
but
they
like
him
had
taken
their
note
on
those
different
occasions
from
their
environment
perhaps
if
his
father
and
mother
came
here
but
michael
s
imagination
quailed
before
such
a
supposition
the
third
point
which
gradually
through
these
weeks
began
to
haunt
him
more
and
more
was
the
personality
of
sylvia
he
had
never
come
across
a
girl
who
in
the
least
resembled
her
probably
because
he
had
not
attempted
even
to
find
in
a
girl
or
to
display
in
himself
the
signals
winked
across
from
one
to
the
other
of
human
companionship
always
he
had
found
a
difficulty
in
talking
to
a
girl
because
he
had
in
his
thought
about
what
he
should
say
there
had
been
the
cabalistic
question
of
sex
ever
in
front
of
him
a
thing
that
troubled
and
deterred
him
but
sylvia
with
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
absorbed
in
her
singing
and
directing
him
only
as
she
would
have
pressed
the
pedal
of
the
piano
if
she
had
been
playing
to
herself
was
no
more
agitating
than
if
she
had
been
a
man
she
was
just
singing
just
using
him
to
help
her
singing
and
even
while
michael
registered
to
himself
this
charming
annihilation
of
sex
which
allowed
her
to
be
to
him
no
more
than
her
brother
was
less
in
fact
but
on
the
same
plane
she
had
come
to
the
end
of
her
song
patted
him
on
the
back
as
she
would
have
patted
anybody
else
with
a
word
of
thanks
and
for
him
suddenly
leaped
into
significance
it
was
not
only
a
singer
who
had
sung
but
an
individual
one
called
sylvia
falbe
she
took
her
place
at
present
a
most
inconspicuous
one
on
the
before
which
michael
s
life
was
acted
towards
which
when
no
action
so
to
speak
was
taking
place
his
eyes
naturally
turned
themselves
his
father
and
mother
were
there
francis
also
and
aunt
barbara
and
of
course
larger
than
the
rest
hermann
now
sylvia
was
discernible
and
as
the
days
went
by
and
their
meetings
multiplied
she
became
bigger
walked
into
a
nearer
perspective
it
did
not
occur
to
michael
rightly
to
imagine
himself
at
all
in
love
with
her
for
he
was
not
only
she
had
asserted
herself
on
his
consciousness
not
yet
had
she
begun
to
trouble
him
and
there
was
no
sign
either
external
or
intimate
in
his
mind
that
he
was
sickening
with
the
splendid
malady
indeed
the
significance
she
held
for
him
was
rather
that
though
she
was
a
girl
she
presented
none
of
the
embarrassments
which
that
sex
had
always
held
for
him
she
grew
in
comradeship
he
found
himself
as
much
at
ease
with
her
as
with
her
brother
and
her
charm
was
just
that
which
had
so
quickly
and
strongly
attracted
michael
to
hermann
she
was
vivid
in
the
same
way
as
he
was
she
had
the
same
warm
welcoming
kindliness
the
same
complete
absence
of
pose
you
knew
where
you
were
with
her
and
hitherto
when
michael
was
with
one
of
the
young
ladies
brought
down
to
ashbridge
to
be
looked
at
he
only
wished
that
wherever
he
was
he
was
somewhere
else
but
with
sylvia
he
had
none
of
this
she
was
bonne
camarade
for
him
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
she
was
bonne
camarade
to
the
rest
of
the
multitude
which
thronged
the
sunday
evenings
perfectly
at
ease
with
them
as
they
with
her
in
relationship
entirely
unsentimental
but
through
these
weeks
up
to
this
foggy
november
afternoon
michael
s
most
conscious
preoccupation
was
his
music
falbe
s
principles
in
teaching
were
entirely
heretical
according
to
the
traditional
school
he
gave
michael
no
scale
to
play
no
dismal
to
fill
the
hours
what
is
the
good
of
them
he
asked
they
can
only
give
you
nimbleness
and
strength
well
you
shall
acquire
your
nimbleness
and
strength
by
playing
what
is
worth
playing
take
good
music
take
chopin
or
bach
or
beethoven
and
practise
one
particular
etude
or
fugue
or
sonata
you
may
choose
anything
you
like
and
learn
your
nimbleness
and
strength
that
way
read
too
read
for
a
couple
of
hours
every
day
the
written
language
of
music
must
become
so
familiar
to
you
that
it
is
to
you
precisely
what
a
book
or
a
newspaper
is
so
that
whether
you
read
it
aloud
which
is
playing
or
sit
in
your
with
your
feet
on
the
fender
reading
it
not
aloud
on
the
piano
but
to
yourself
it
conveys
its
definite
meaning
to
you
at
your
lessons
you
will
have
to
read
aloud
to
me
but
when
you
are
reading
to
yourself
never
pass
over
a
bar
that
you
don
t
understand
it
has
got
to
sound
in
your
head
just
as
the
words
you
read
in
a
printed
book
really
sound
in
your
head
if
you
read
carefully
and
listen
for
them
you
know
exactly
what
they
would
be
like
if
you
said
them
aloud
can
you
read
by
the
way
have
a
falbe
got
down
a
volume
of
bach
and
opened
it
at
random
there
he
said
begin
at
the
top
of
the
but
i
can
t
said
michael
i
shall
have
to
spell
it
that
s
just
what
you
mustn
t
do
go
ahead
and
don
t
pause
till
you
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
page
count
start
each
bar
when
it
comes
to
its
turn
and
play
as
many
notes
as
you
can
in
this
was
a
dismal
experience
michael
hitherto
had
gone
on
the
painstaking
and
thorough
plan
of
spelling
out
his
notes
with
laborious
care
now
falbe
s
inexorable
voice
counted
for
him
until
it
was
lost
in
inextinguishable
laughter
go
on
go
on
he
shouted
i
thought
it
was
bach
and
it
is
clearly
strauss
s
don
michael
flushed
and
determined
with
grave
set
mouth
ploughed
his
way
through
amazing
dissonances
and
at
the
end
joined
falbe
s
laughter
oh
dear
he
said
very
funny
but
don
t
laugh
so
at
me
falbe
dried
his
eyes
and
what
was
it
he
said
i
declare
it
was
the
fourth
fugue
an
entirely
different
conception
of
it
a
thoroughly
original
view
now
what
you
ve
got
to
do
is
to
repeat
that
not
the
same
murder
i
mean
but
other
murders
for
a
couple
of
hours
a
day
by
degrees
you
won
t
believe
it
you
will
find
you
are
not
murdering
any
longer
but
only
mortally
wounding
after
six
months
i
dare
say
you
won
t
even
be
hurting
your
victims
all
the
same
you
can
begin
with
less
muscular
in
this
way
michael
s
musical
horizons
were
infinitely
extended
not
only
did
this
system
of
falbe
s
of
flying
at
new
music
and
going
recklessly
and
regardlessly
on
give
quickness
to
his
brain
and
finger
make
his
wits
alert
to
pick
up
the
new
language
he
was
learning
but
it
gloriously
extended
his
vision
and
his
range
of
country
he
ran
joyfully
though
with
a
thousand
falls
and
tumbles
through
these
new
and
wonderful
vistas
he
worshipped
at
the
grave
gothic
sanctuaries
of
beethoven
he
roamed
through
the
enchanted
garden
of
chopin
he
felt
the
icy
and
eternal
frosts
of
russia
and
saw
in
the
northern
sky
the
great
auroras
spread
themselves
in
spear
and
sword
of
fire
he
listened
to
the
wisdom
of
brahms
and
passed
through
the
noble
and
smiling
country
of
bach
all
this
so
to
speak
was
holiday
travel
and
between
his
journeys
he
applied
himself
with
the
same
eager
industry
to
the
learning
of
his
art
so
that
he
might
reproduce
for
himself
and
others
true
pictures
of
the
scenes
through
which
he
scampered
here
falbe
was
not
so
easily
moved
to
laughter
he
was
as
severe
with
michael
as
he
was
with
himself
when
it
was
the
question
of
learning
some
piece
with
a
view
to
really
playing
it
there
was
no
hurrying
on
through
blurred
runs
and
false
notes
slurred
phrases
and
incomplete
chords
among
these
pieces
which
had
to
be
properly
learned
was
the
prelude
of
chopin
on
hearing
which
at
baireuth
on
the
tuneless
and
catarrhed
piano
falbe
had
agreed
to
take
michael
as
a
pupil
but
when
it
was
played
again
on
falbe
s
great
steinway
as
a
professed
performance
a
very
different
standard
was
required
falbe
stopped
him
at
the
end
of
the
first
two
lines
this
won
t
do
michael
he
said
you
played
it
before
for
me
to
see
whether
you
could
play
you
can
but
it
won
t
do
to
sketch
it
every
note
has
got
to
be
there
chopin
didn
t
write
them
by
accident
he
knew
quite
well
what
he
was
about
begin
again
this
time
michael
got
not
quite
so
far
when
he
was
stopped
again
he
was
playing
without
notes
and
falbe
got
up
from
his
chair
where
he
had
the
book
open
and
put
it
on
the
piano
do
you
find
difficulty
in
memorising
he
asked
this
was
discouraging
michael
believed
that
he
remembered
easily
he
also
believed
that
he
had
long
known
this
by
heart
no
i
thought
i
knew
it
he
said
try
this
time
falbe
stood
by
him
and
suddenly
put
his
finger
down
into
the
middle
of
michael
s
hands
striking
a
note
you
left
out
that
f
sharp
he
said
go
on
now
you
are
leaving
out
that
e
natural
try
to
get
it
better
by
thursday
and
remember
this
that
playing
and
all
that
differentiates
playing
from
strumming
only
begins
when
you
can
play
all
the
notes
that
are
put
down
for
you
to
play
without
fail
you
re
beginning
at
the
wrong
end
you
have
admirable
feeling
about
that
prelude
but
you
needn
t
think
about
feeling
till
you
ve
got
all
the
notes
at
your
fingers
ends
then
and
not
till
then
you
may
begin
to
remember
that
you
want
to
be
a
pianist
now
what
s
the
next
thing
michael
felt
somewhat
squashed
and
discouraged
he
had
thought
he
had
really
worked
successfully
at
the
thing
he
knew
so
well
by
sight
his
heavy
eyebrows
drew
together
you
told
me
to
harmonise
that
christmas
carol
he
remarked
rather
shortly
falbe
put
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
look
here
michael
he
said
you
re
vexed
with
me
now
there
s
nothing
to
be
vexed
at
you
know
quite
well
you
were
leaving
out
lots
of
notes
from
those
jolly
fat
chords
and
that
you
weren
t
playing
cleanly
now
i
m
taking
you
seriously
and
i
won
t
have
from
you
anything
but
the
best
you
can
do
you
re
not
doing
your
best
when
you
don
t
even
play
what
is
written
you
can
t
begin
to
work
at
this
till
you
do
michael
had
a
moment
s
severe
tussle
with
his
temper
he
felt
vexed
and
disappointed
that
hermann
should
have
sent
him
back
like
a
schoolboy
with
his
exercise
torn
over
not
immediately
did
he
confess
to
himself
that
he
was
completely
in
the
wrong
i
m
doing
the
best
i
can
he
said
it
s
rather
he
moved
his
big
shoulders
slightly
as
if
to
indicate
that
hermann
s
hand
was
not
wanted
there
hermann
kept
it
there
it
might
be
discouraging
he
said
if
you
were
doing
your
michael
s
oozed
from
him
i
m
wrong
he
said
turning
round
with
the
smile
that
made
his
ugly
face
so
pleasant
and
i
m
sorry
both
that
i
have
been
slack
and
that
i
ve
been
sulky
will
that
do
falbe
laughed
very
well
indeed
he
said
now
for
good
king
wasn
t
it
yes
i
got
awfully
interested
over
it
hermann
i
thought
i
would
try
and
work
it
up
into
a
few
let
s
hear
said
falbe
this
was
a
vastly
different
affair
michael
had
shown
both
ingenuity
and
a
great
sense
of
harmonic
beauty
in
the
arrangement
of
the
very
simple
little
tune
that
falbe
had
made
him
exercise
his
ear
over
and
the
variations
that
followed
showed
a
wonderfully
mature
handling
the
air
which
he
dealt
with
haunted
them
as
a
sort
of
unseen
presence
it
moved
in
a
tiny
gavotte
or
looked
on
at
a
minuet
measure
it
wailed
yet
without
being
positively
heard
in
a
little
dirge
of
itself
it
broadened
into
a
march
it
shouted
in
a
bravura
of
rapid
octaves
and
finally
asserted
itself
heard
once
more
over
a
great
scale
base
of
bells
falbe
as
was
his
habit
when
interested
sat
absolutely
still
but
receptive
and
alert
instead
of
jerking
and
fidgeting
as
he
had
done
over
michael
s
fiasco
in
the
chopin
prelude
and
at
the
end
he
jumped
up
with
a
certain
excitement
do
you
know
what
you
ve
done
he
said
you
ve
done
something
that
s
really
good
faults
yes
millions
but
there
s
a
imagination
at
the
bottom
of
it
how
did
it
happen
michael
flushed
with
pleasure
oh
they
sang
themselves
he
said
and
i
learned
them
but
will
it
really
do
is
there
anything
in
it
yes
old
boy
there
s
king
wenceslas
in
it
and
you
ve
dressed
him
up
well
play
that
last
one
the
last
one
was
taxing
to
the
fingers
but
michael
s
big
hands
banged
out
the
octave
scale
in
the
bass
with
wonderful
ease
and
falbe
gave
a
great
guffaw
of
pleasure
at
the
rollicking
conclusion
write
them
all
down
he
said
and
try
if
you
can
hear
it
singing
half
a
dozen
more
if
you
can
write
them
down
also
and
give
me
leave
to
play
the
lot
at
my
concert
in
michael
gasped
you
don
t
mean
that
he
said
certainly
i
do
it
s
a
fine
bit
of
it
was
with
these
variations
now
on
the
point
of
completion
that
michael
meant
to
spend
his
solitary
and
rapturous
evening
the
spirits
of
the
air
whatever
those
melodious
sprites
may
be
had
for
the
last
month
made
themselves
very
audible
to
him
and
the
further
variations
that
hermann
had
demanded
had
rung
all
day
in
his
head
now
as
they
neared
completion
he
found
that
they
ceased
their
singing
their
work
of
dictation
was
done
he
had
to
this
extent
expressed
himself
and
they
haunted
him
no
longer
at
present
he
had
but
jotted
down
the
skeleton
of
bars
that
could
be
filled
in
afterwards
and
it
gave
him
enormous
pleasure
to
see
the
roles
reversed
and
himself
out
of
his
own
brain
setting
falbe
his
task
but
he
felt
much
more
than
this
he
had
done
something
michael
the
dumb
awkward
michael
was
somehow
revealed
on
those
eight
pages
of
music
all
his
years
he
had
stood
wistfully
inarticulate
unable
so
it
had
seemed
to
him
to
show
himself
to
let
himself
out
and
not
till
now
when
he
had
found
this
means
of
access
did
he
know
how
passionately
he
had
desired
it
nor
how
immensely
in
the
process
of
so
doing
his
desire
had
grown
he
must
find
out
more
ways
other
channels
of
projecting
himself
the
need
for
that
as
of
a
diver
throwing
himself
into
the
empty
air
and
the
laughing
waters
below
him
suddenly
took
hold
of
him
he
took
a
clean
sheet
of
music
paper
into
which
he
placed
his
pages
and
with
a
pleasurable
sense
of
pomp
wrote
in
the
centre
of
it
variations
on
an
air
by
michael
comber
he
paused
a
moment
then
took
up
his
pen
again
dedicated
to
sylvia
falbe
he
wrote
at
the
top
chapter
vii
michael
had
been
so
engrossingly
employed
since
his
return
to
london
in
the
autumn
that
the
existence
of
other
ties
and
other
people
apart
from
those
immediately
connected
with
his
work
had
worn
a
very
aspect
he
had
it
is
true
written
with
some
regularity
to
his
mother
finding
somewhat
to
his
dismay
how
very
slight
the
common
ground
between
them
was
for
purposes
of
correspondence
he
could
outline
the
facts
that
he
had
been
to
several
concerts
that
he
had
seen
much
of
his
that
he
had
been
diligent
at
his
work
but
he
realised
that
there
was
nothing
in
detail
about
those
things
that
could
possibly
interest
her
and
that
nothing
except
them
really
interested
him
she
on
her
side
had
little
to
say
except
to
record
the
welfare
of
petsy
to
remark
on
the
beauty
of
october
and
tell
him
how
many
shooting
parties
they
had
had
his
correspondence
with
his
father
had
been
less
frequent
and
absolutely
since
lord
ashbridge
took
no
notice
at
all
of
his
letters
michael
regretted
this
as
showing
that
he
was
still
outcast
but
it
can
not
be
said
to
have
come
between
him
and
the
sunshine
for
he
had
begun
to
manufacture
the
sunshine
within
that
internal
happiness
which
his
environment
and
way
of
life
produced
which
seemed
to
be
independent
of
all
that
was
not
directly
connected
with
it
but
a
letter
which
he
received
next
morning
from
his
mother
stated
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
petsy
had
another
of
her
tiresome
bilious
attacks
poor
lamb
that
his
father
and
she
thought
it
right
that
he
should
come
down
to
ashbridge
for
christmas
it
conveyed
the
sense
that
at
this
joyful
season
a
truce
probably
limited
in
duration
and
even
while
it
lasted
of
the
nature
of
a
neutrality
was
proclaimed
but
the
prospect
was
not
wholly
encouraging
for
lady
ashbridge
added
that
she
hoped
michael
would
not
go
on
vexing
his
father
what
precisely
michael
was
expected
to
do
in
order
to
fulfil
that
wish
was
not
further
stated
but
he
wrote
dutifully
enough
to
say
that
he
would
come
down
at
christmas
but
the
letter
rekindled
his
dormant
sense
of
there
being
other
people
in
the
world
beside
his
immediate
circle
also
indefinably
it
gave
him
the
sense
that
his
mother
wanted
him
that
should
be
so
then
and
sequentially
he
remembered
with
a
pang
of
that
he
had
not
as
much
as
indicated
his
presence
in
london
to
aunt
barbara
or
set
eyes
on
her
since
their
meeting
in
august
he
knew
she
was
in
london
since
he
had
seen
her
name
in
some
paragraph
in
the
papers
not
long
before
and
instantly
wrote
to
ask
her
to
dine
with
him
at
a
near
date
her
answer
was
characteristic
of
course
i
ll
dine
with
you
my
dear
she
wrote
it
will
be
delightful
and
what
has
happened
to
you
your
letter
actually
conveyed
a
sense
of
cordiality
you
never
used
to
be
cordial
and
i
wish
to
meet
some
of
your
nice
friends
ask
one
or
two
please
a
prima
donna
of
some
kind
and
a
pianist
i
think
i
want
them
weird
and
original
the
prima
donna
with
short
hair
and
the
pianist
with
long
in
tony
s
new
station
in
life
i
never
see
anybody
except
the
sort
of
people
whom
your
father
likes
are
you
forgiven
yet
by
the
way
michael
found
himself
on
the
grin
at
the
thought
of
aunt
barbara
suddenly
encountering
the
two
magnificent
falbes
prima
donna
and
pianist
exactly
as
she
had
desired
as
representing
the
weird
sort
of
people
whom
she
pictured
his
living
among
and
the
result
quite
came
up
to
his
expectations
as
usual
aunt
barbara
was
late
and
came
in
talking
rapidly
about
the
various
causes
that
had
detained
her
which
her
fruitful
imagination
had
suggested
to
her
as
she
dressed
in
order
perhaps
to
suit
herself
to
the
circle
in
which
she
would
pass
the
evening
she
had
put
on
or
rather
it
looked
as
if
her
maid
had
thrown
at
her
a
very
awful
sort
of
brown
and
and
adapted
to
bohemian
circles
she
with
the
same
lively
imagination
had
pictured
michael
in
a
velveteen
coat
and
soft
shirt
the
pianist
as
very
small
with
spectacles
and
long
hair
and
the
prima
donna
a
kind
of
barmaid
with
roman
pearls
yes
my
dear
i
know
i
am
late
she
began
before
she
was
inside
the
door
but
og
had
so
much
to
say
and
there
was
a
block
at
hyde
park
corner
my
dear
michael
how
smart
you
look
she
came
round
the
corner
of
the
screen
and
the
falbes
burst
upon
her
hermann
and
sylvia
standing
by
the
fire
for
the
short
spectacled
pianist
there
was
this
very
tall
young
man
upright
and
soldierly
with
his
handsome
boyish
face
and
clothes
that
was
bad
enough
but
infinitely
worse
was
she
who
was
to
have
been
the
barmaid
instead
was
this
magnificent
girl
nearly
as
tall
as
her
brother
with
her
small
oval
face
crowning
the
column
of
her
neck
her
eyes
merry
her
mouth
laughing
at
some
brotherly
retort
that
hermann
had
just
made
aunt
barbara
took
her
in
with
one
second
s
survey
her
face
her
neck
her
beautiful
dress
her
whole
air
of
ease
and
and
gave
a
despairing
glance
at
her
own
prickly
for
the
moment
amiably
accustomed
as
she
was
to
laugh
at
herself
she
did
not
find
it
humourous
miss
sylvia
falbe
aunt
barbara
said
michael
with
a
little
tremor
in
his
voice
and
hermann
falbe
lady
barbara
jerome
he
added
rather
as
if
he
expected
nobody
to
believe
it
aunt
barbara
made
the
best
of
it
shook
hands
in
her
jolly
manner
and
burst
into
laughter
michael
i
could
slay
you
she
said
but
before
i
do
that
i
must
tell
your
friends
all
about
it
this
horrible
nephew
of
mine
miss
falbe
promised
me
two
weird
musicians
and
i
expected
i
really
can
t
tell
you
what
i
expected
but
there
were
to
be
spectacles
and
velveteen
coats
and
the
general
air
of
an
afternoon
concert
at
clapham
junction
but
it
is
nice
to
be
made
such
a
fool
of
i
feel
precisely
like
an
elderly
and
sour
governess
who
has
been
ordered
to
come
down
to
dinner
so
that
there
shan
t
be
thirteen
give
me
your
arm
falbe
and
take
me
in
to
dinner
at
once
where
i
may
drown
my
embarrassment
in
soup
or
does
michael
go
in
first
go
on
wretch
presently
they
were
seated
at
dinner
and
aunt
barbara
could
not
help
enlarging
a
little
on
her
own
discomfiture
it
is
all
your
fault
michael
she
said
you
have
been
in
london
all
these
weeks
without
letting
me
know
anything
about
you
or
your
friends
or
what
you
were
doing
so
naturally
i
supposed
you
were
leading
some
obscure
kind
of
existence
instead
of
which
i
find
this
sort
of
thing
my
dear
what
good
soup
i
shall
see
if
i
can
t
induce
your
cook
to
leave
you
but
bachelors
always
have
the
best
of
everything
now
tell
me
about
your
visit
to
germany
which
was
the
point
where
we
parted
baireuth
wasn
t
it
i
would
not
go
to
baireuth
with
anybody
i
went
with
falbe
said
michael
ah
falbe
has
not
asked
me
yet
i
may
have
to
revise
what
i
say
said
aunt
barbara
daringly
i
didn
t
ask
michael
said
hermann
i
got
into
his
carriage
as
the
train
was
moving
and
my
luggage
was
left
i
was
left
behind
said
sylvia
which
was
worse
but
i
sent
hermann
s
so
expeditiously
that
it
arrived
the
day
before
we
left
for
munich
remarked
hermann
and
that
s
all
the
gratitude
i
get
but
in
the
interval
you
lived
upon
lord
i
do
still
in
the
money
i
earn
by
giving
him
music
lessons
mike
have
you
finished
the
variations
yet
variations
what
are
variations
asked
aunt
barbara
yes
two
days
ago
variations
are
all
the
things
you
think
about
on
the
piano
aunt
barbara
when
you
are
playing
a
tune
made
by
somebody
should
i
like
them
will
falbe
play
them
to
me
asked
she
i
daresay
he
will
if
he
can
but
i
thought
you
loathed
it
certainly
depends
on
who
makes
it
said
aunt
barbara
i
don
t
like
ordinary
music
because
the
person
who
made
it
doesn
t
matter
to
me
but
if
so
to
speak
it
sounds
like
somebody
i
know
it
is
a
different
michael
turned
to
sylvia
i
want
to
ask
your
leave
for
something
i
have
already
done
he
said
and
if
i
don
t
give
it
you
then
i
shan
t
tell
you
what
it
sylvia
looked
at
him
with
her
candid
friendly
eyes
her
brother
always
told
her
that
she
never
looked
at
anybody
except
her
friends
if
she
was
engaged
in
conversation
with
a
man
she
did
not
like
she
looked
at
his
or
at
a
point
slightly
above
his
head
then
of
course
i
give
in
she
said
i
must
give
you
leave
if
otherwise
i
shan
t
know
what
you
have
done
but
it
s
a
mean
trick
tell
me
at
i
ve
dedicated
the
variations
to
you
he
said
sylvia
flushed
with
pleasure
oh
but
that
s
absolutely
darling
of
you
she
said
have
you
really
do
you
mean
it
if
you
ll
allow
allow
you
hermann
the
variations
are
mine
isn
t
it
too
lovely
it
was
at
this
moment
that
aunt
barbara
happened
to
glance
at
michael
and
it
suddenly
struck
her
that
it
was
a
perfectly
new
michael
whom
she
looked
at
she
knew
and
was
secretly
amused
at
the
fiasco
that
always
attended
the
introduction
of
amiable
young
ladies
to
ashbridge
and
had
warned
her
that
michael
when
he
chose
the
girl
he
wanted
would
certainly
do
it
on
his
own
initiative
now
she
felt
sure
that
michael
though
he
might
not
be
aware
of
it
himself
was
even
if
he
had
not
chosen
beginning
to
choose
there
was
that
in
his
eyes
which
none
of
the
importations
to
ashbridge
had
ever
seen
there
that
eager
deferential
attention
which
shows
that
a
young
man
is
interested
because
it
is
a
girl
he
is
talking
to
that
she
knew
had
never
been
characteristic
of
michael
indeed
it
would
not
have
been
far
from
the
truth
to
say
that
the
fact
that
he
was
talking
to
a
girl
was
sufficient
to
make
his
countenance
wear
an
expression
of
polite
boredom
then
for
a
while
as
dinner
progressed
she
doubted
the
validity
of
her
conclusion
for
the
michael
who
was
entertaining
her
was
wholly
different
from
the
michael
she
had
known
and
liked
and
pitied
she
felt
that
she
did
not
know
this
new
one
yet
but
she
was
certain
that
she
liked
him
and
equally
sure
that
she
did
not
pity
him
at
all
he
had
found
his
place
he
had
found
his
work
he
evidently
fitted
into
his
life
which
after
all
is
the
surest
ground
of
happiness
and
it
might
be
that
it
was
only
general
joy
so
to
speak
that
kindled
that
pleasant
fire
in
his
face
and
then
once
more
she
went
back
to
her
first
conclusion
for
talking
to
michael
herself
she
saw
as
a
woman
so
infallibly
sees
that
he
gave
her
but
the
most
superficial
attention
sufficient
indeed
to
allow
him
to
answer
intelligently
and
laugh
at
the
proper
places
but
his
mind
was
not
in
the
least
occupied
with
her
if
sylvia
moved
his
glance
flickered
across
in
her
direction
it
was
she
who
gave
him
his
alertness
aunt
barbara
felt
that
she
could
have
told
him
truthfully
that
he
was
in
love
with
her
and
she
rather
thought
that
it
would
be
news
to
him
probably
he
did
not
know
it
yet
himself
and
she
wondered
what
his
father
would
say
when
he
knew
it
and
then
munich
she
said
violently
recalling
michael
s
attention
towards
her
munich
i
could
have
borne
better
than
baireuth
and
when
falbe
asks
me
there
i
shall
probably
go
your
uncle
tony
was
in
germany
then
by
the
way
he
went
over
at
the
invitation
of
the
emperor
to
the
did
he
the
emperor
came
to
munich
for
a
day
during
them
he
was
at
the
opera
said
michael
you
didn
t
speak
to
him
i
suppose
she
asked
yes
he
sent
for
me
and
talked
a
lot
in
fact
he
talked
too
much
because
i
didn
t
hear
a
note
of
the
second
aunt
barbara
became
infinitely
more
interested
tell
me
all
about
it
michael
she
said
what
did
he
talk
about
everything
as
far
as
i
can
remember
england
ashbridge
armies
navies
music
hermann
says
he
cast
pearls
before
swine
and
his
tone
his
attitude
she
asked
towards
us
towards
england
immensely
friendly
and
most
inquisitive
i
was
never
asked
so
many
questions
in
so
short
a
aunt
barbara
suddenly
turned
to
falbe
and
you
she
asked
were
you
with
michael
no
lady
barbara
i
had
no
and
are
you
naturalised
english
she
asked
no
i
am
she
slid
swiftly
off
the
topic
do
you
wonder
i
ask
with
your
talking
english
so
perfectly
she
said
you
should
hear
me
talking
french
when
we
are
entertaining
ambassadors
and
that
sort
of
persons
i
talk
it
so
fast
that
nobody
can
understand
a
word
i
say
that
is
a
defensive
measure
you
must
observe
because
even
if
i
talked
it
quite
slowly
they
would
understand
just
as
little
but
they
think
it
is
the
pace
that
stupefies
them
and
they
leave
me
in
a
curious
dazed
condition
and
now
miss
falbe
and
i
are
going
to
leave
you
two
be
rather
a
long
time
dear
michael
so
that
falbe
can
tell
you
what
he
thinks
of
me
and
his
sister
shall
tell
me
what
she
thinks
of
you
afterwards
you
and
i
will
tell
each
other
if
it
is
not
too
this
did
not
express
quite
accurately
lady
barbara
s
intentions
for
she
chiefly
wanted
to
find
out
what
she
thought
of
sylvia
and
you
are
great
friends
you
three
she
said
as
they
settled
themselves
for
the
prolonged
absence
of
the
two
men
sylvia
smiled
she
smiled
aunt
barbara
noticed
almost
entirely
with
her
eyes
using
her
mouth
only
when
it
came
to
laughing
but
her
eyes
smiled
quite
charmingly
that
s
always
rather
a
rash
thing
to
pronounce
on
she
said
i
can
tell
you
for
certain
that
hermann
and
i
are
both
very
fond
of
him
but
it
is
presumptuous
for
us
to
say
that
he
is
equally
devoted
to
my
dear
there
is
no
call
for
modesty
about
it
said
barbara
between
you
for
i
imagine
it
is
you
who
have
done
it
between
you
you
have
made
a
perfectly
different
creature
of
the
boy
you
ve
made
him
sylvia
became
quite
grave
oh
i
do
hope
he
likes
us
she
said
he
is
so
likable
barbara
nodded
and
you
ve
had
the
good
sense
to
find
that
out
she
said
it
s
astonishing
how
few
people
knew
it
but
then
as
i
said
michael
hadn
t
flowered
no
one
understood
him
or
was
interested
then
he
suddenly
made
up
his
mind
last
summer
what
he
wanted
to
do
and
be
and
immediately
did
and
was
i
think
he
told
hermann
said
she
his
father
didn
t
approve
did
he
approve
my
dear
if
you
knew
my
brother
you
would
know
that
the
only
things
he
approves
of
are
those
which
michael
isn
sylvia
spread
her
fine
hands
out
to
the
blaze
warming
them
and
shading
her
face
michael
always
seems
to
us
she
began
ah
i
called
him
michael
by
then
do
it
on
purpose
next
time
remarked
barbara
what
does
michael
seem
ah
but
don
t
let
him
know
i
called
him
michael
said
sylvia
in
some
horror
there
is
nothing
so
awful
as
to
speak
of
people
formally
to
their
faces
and
intimately
behind
their
backs
but
hermann
is
always
talking
of
him
as
and
michael
always
seems
oh
yes
he
always
seems
to
me
to
have
been
part
of
us
of
hermann
and
me
for
years
he
s
there
if
you
know
what
i
mean
and
so
few
people
are
there
they
walk
about
your
life
and
go
in
and
out
so
to
speak
but
michael
stops
i
suppose
it
s
because
he
is
so
aunt
barbara
had
been
a
diplomatist
long
before
her
husband
and
fearful
of
appearing
inquisitive
about
sylvia
s
impression
of
michael
which
she
really
wanted
to
inquire
into
instantly
changed
the
subject
ah
everybody
who
has
got
definite
things
to
do
is
natural
she
said
it
is
only
the
idle
people
who
have
leisure
to
look
at
themselves
in
the
glass
and
pose
and
i
feel
sure
that
you
have
definite
things
to
do
and
plenty
of
them
my
dear
what
are
they
oh
i
sing
a
little
said
sylvia
that
is
the
first
unnatural
thing
you
have
said
i
somehow
feel
that
you
sing
a
great
aunt
barbara
suddenly
got
up
my
dear
you
are
not
the
miss
falbe
are
you
who
drove
london
crazy
with
delight
last
summer
don
t
tell
me
you
are
the
miss
falbe
sylvia
laughed
do
you
know
i
m
afraid
i
must
be
she
said
isn
t
it
dreadful
to
have
to
say
that
after
your
description
aunt
barbara
sat
down
again
in
a
sort
of
calm
despair
if
there
are
any
more
shocks
coming
for
me
she
said
i
think
i
had
better
go
home
i
have
encountered
a
perfectly
new
nephew
michael
i
have
dressed
myself
like
a
suburban
housekeeper
to
meet
a
poiret
so
don
t
deny
it
and
having
humourously
told
michael
i
wished
to
see
a
prima
donna
and
a
pianist
he
takes
me
at
my
word
and
produces
the
miss
falbe
i
m
glad
i
knew
that
in
time
i
should
infallibly
have
asked
you
to
sing
and
if
you
had
done
so
you
are
probably
enough
to
have
done
even
that
i
should
have
given
the
gasp
at
the
end
and
told
your
brother
that
i
thought
you
sang
very
sylvia
laughed
but
really
it
wasn
t
my
fault
lady
barbara
she
said
when
we
met
i
couldn
t
have
said
beware
i
am
the
miss
no
my
dear
but
i
think
you
ought
somehow
to
have
conveyed
the
impression
that
you
were
a
tremendous
swell
you
didn
t
i
have
been
thinking
of
you
as
a
charming
girl
and
nothing
but
that
s
quite
good
enough
for
me
said
sylvia
the
two
young
men
joined
them
after
this
and
hermann
speedily
became
engrossed
in
reading
the
finished
variations
some
of
these
pleased
him
mightily
one
he
altogether
demurred
to
it
s
just
a
crib
mike
he
said
the
critics
would
say
i
had
forgotten
it
and
put
in
instead
what
i
could
remember
of
a
variation
out
of
the
handel
theme
that
next
one
s
oh
great
fun
but
i
wish
you
would
remember
that
we
all
haven
t
got
great
paws
like
aunt
barbara
stopped
in
the
middle
of
her
sentence
she
knew
michael
s
old
sensitiveness
about
these
physical
disabilities
and
she
had
a
moment
s
cold
horror
at
the
thought
of
falbe
having
said
so
miserably
tactless
a
thing
to
him
but
the
horror
was
of
infinitesimal
duration
for
she
heard
michael
s
laugh
as
they
leaned
over
the
top
of
the
piano
together
i
wish
you
had
hermann
he
said
i
know
you
ll
bungle
those
falbe
moved
to
the
oh
let
s
have
a
shot
at
it
he
said
if
lady
barbara
won
t
mind
play
that
one
through
to
me
first
oh
presently
hermann
he
said
it
makes
such
an
infernal
row
that
you
can
t
hear
anything
else
afterwards
do
sing
miss
sylvia
my
aunt
won
t
really
mind
will
you
aunt
barbara
michael
i
have
just
learned
that
this
is
the
miss
falbe
she
said
i
am
suffering
from
shock
do
let
me
suffer
from
coals
of
fire
michael
gently
edged
hermann
away
from
the
much
as
he
enjoyed
his
master
s
accompaniment
he
was
perfectly
sure
that
he
preferred
if
possible
to
play
for
sylvia
himself
than
have
the
pleasure
of
listening
to
anybody
else
and
may
i
play
for
you
miss
sylvia
he
asked
yes
will
you
thanks
lord
hermann
moved
away
and
so
hermann
sits
down
by
lady
barbara
while
lord
comber
plays
for
miss
sylvia
he
observed
with
emphasis
on
the
titles
a
sudden
amazing
boldness
seized
michael
sylvia
then
he
said
all
right
michael
answered
the
girl
laughing
she
came
and
stood
on
the
left
of
the
piano
slightly
behind
him
and
what
are
we
going
to
have
asked
michael
it
must
be
something
we
both
know
for
i
ve
brought
no
music
said
she
michael
began
playing
the
introduction
to
the
hugo
wolff
song
which
he
had
accompanied
for
her
one
sunday
night
at
their
house
he
knew
it
perfectly
by
heart
but
stumbled
a
little
over
the
difficult
syncopated
time
this
was
not
done
without
purpose
for
the
next
moment
he
felt
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
marking
it
for
him
yes
that
s
right
she
said
now
you
ve
got
and
michael
smiled
sweetly
at
his
own
amazing
ingenuity
hermann
put
down
the
variations
which
he
still
had
in
his
hand
when
sylvia
s
voice
began
unaccustomed
as
she
was
to
her
accompanist
his
trained
ear
told
him
that
she
was
singing
perfectly
at
ease
and
was
completely
at
home
with
her
player
occasionally
she
gave
michael
some
little
indication
as
she
had
done
before
but
for
the
most
part
her
fingers
rested
immobile
on
his
shoulder
and
he
seemed
to
understand
her
perfectly
somehow
this
was
a
surprise
to
him
he
had
not
known
that
michael
possessed
that
sort
of
that
unerringly
feels
and
translates
into
the
keys
the
singer
s
mood
for
himself
he
always
had
to
attend
most
closely
when
he
was
playing
for
his
sister
but
familiar
as
he
was
with
her
singing
he
felt
that
michael
divined
her
certainly
as
well
as
himself
and
he
listened
to
the
piano
more
than
to
the
voice
you
extraordinary
creature
he
said
when
the
song
was
over
where
did
you
learn
to
accompany
suddenly
michael
felt
an
access
of
shyness
as
if
he
had
been
surprised
when
he
thought
himself
private
oh
i
ve
played
it
before
for
miss
i
mean
for
sylvia
he
said
then
he
turned
to
the
girl
thanks
awfully
he
said
and
i
m
greedy
may
we
have
one
more
he
slid
into
the
opening
bars
of
who
is
sylvia
that
song
since
he
had
heard
her
sing
it
at
her
recital
in
the
summer
had
grown
in
significance
to
him
even
as
she
had
it
had
seemed
part
of
her
then
but
then
she
was
a
stranger
it
was
even
more
intimately
part
of
her
and
she
was
a
friend
hermann
strolled
across
to
the
fireplace
at
the
end
of
this
and
lit
a
cigarette
my
sister
s
a
blatant
egoist
lady
barbara
he
said
she
loves
singing
about
herself
and
she
lays
it
on
pretty
thick
too
doesn
t
she
now
sylvia
if
you
ve
finished
quite
finished
i
mean
do
come
and
sit
down
and
let
me
try
these
variations
shall
we
surrender
michael
asked
the
girl
or
shall
we
stick
to
the
piano
now
we
ve
got
it
if
hermann
once
sits
down
you
know
we
shan
t
get
him
away
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
i
can
t
sing
any
more
but
we
might
play
a
duet
to
keep
him
hermann
rushed
to
the
piano
took
his
sister
by
the
shoulders
and
pushed
her
into
a
chair
you
sit
there
he
said
and
listen
to
something
not
about
yourself
michael
if
you
don
t
come
away
from
that
piano
i
shall
take
sylvia
home
at
once
now
you
may
all
talk
as
much
as
you
like
you
won
t
interrupt
me
one
atom
but
you
ll
have
to
talk
loud
in
certain
then
a
feat
of
marvellous
execution
began
michael
had
taken
an
evil
pleasure
in
giving
his
master
for
whom
he
slaved
with
so
unwearied
a
diligence
something
that
should
tax
his
powers
and
he
gave
a
great
crash
of
laughter
when
for
a
moment
hermann
was
brought
to
a
complete
standstill
in
an
octave
passage
of
triplets
against
quavers
and
the
performer
exultantly
joined
in
it
as
he
pushed
his
hair
back
from
his
forehead
and
made
a
second
attempt
it
isn
t
decent
to
ask
a
fellow
to
read
that
he
shouted
it
s
a
crime
it
s
a
my
dear
nobody
asked
you
to
read
it
said
sylvia
silence
you
chit
mike
come
here
a
minute
sit
down
one
second
and
play
that
promise
to
get
up
again
though
immediately
just
these
three
bars
yes
i
see
an
apparently
can
do
it
so
why
not
i
am
i
not
much
better
than
they
go
away
please
or
rather
stop
there
and
turn
over
why
couldn
t
you
have
finished
the
page
with
the
last
act
and
started
this
one
fresh
instead
of
making
this
godforsaken
arrangement
now
a
very
simple
little
minuet
measure
followed
this
outrageous
passage
and
hermann
s
exquisite
lightness
of
touch
made
it
sound
strangely
remote
as
if
from
a
mile
away
or
a
hundred
years
ago
some
graceful
echo
was
evoked
again
then
the
little
dirge
wept
for
the
memories
of
something
that
had
never
happened
and
leaving
out
the
number
he
disapproved
of
as
reminiscent
of
the
handel
theme
hermann
gathered
himself
up
again
for
the
assertion
of
the
original
tune
with
its
bars
of
scale
octaves
the
contagious
jollity
of
it
all
seized
the
others
and
sylvia
with
full
voice
and
aunt
barbara
in
a
strange
hooting
sang
to
it
then
hermann
banged
out
the
last
chord
and
jumped
up
from
his
seat
rolling
up
the
music
i
go
straight
home
he
said
and
have
a
peaceful
hour
with
it
michael
old
boy
how
did
you
do
it
you
ve
been
studying
seriously
for
a
few
months
only
and
so
this
must
all
have
been
in
you
before
and
you
ve
come
to
the
age
you
are
without
letting
any
of
it
out
i
suppose
that
s
why
it
has
come
with
a
rush
you
knew
it
all
along
while
you
were
wasting
your
time
over
drilling
your
toy
soldiers
come
on
sylvia
or
i
shall
go
without
you
good
night
lady
barbara
ten
protest
was
clearly
useless
and
having
seen
the
two
off
michael
came
upstairs
again
to
aunt
barbara
who
had
no
intention
of
going
away
just
yet
and
so
these
are
the
people
you
have
been
living
with
she
said
no
wonder
you
had
not
time
to
come
and
see
me
do
they
always
go
that
sort
of
pace
it
is
quicker
than
when
i
talk
michael
sank
into
a
chair
oh
yes
that
s
hermann
all
over
he
said
but
but
just
think
what
it
means
to
me
he
s
going
to
play
my
tunes
at
his
concert
michael
comber
op
o
lord
o
lord
and
you
just
met
him
in
the
train
said
aunt
barbara
yes
second
class
victoria
station
with
sylvia
on
the
platform
i
didn
t
much
notice
sylvia
this
and
the
inference
that
naturally
followed
was
as
much
as
could
be
expected
and
aunt
barbara
did
not
appear
to
wait
for
anything
more
on
the
subject
of
sylvia
she
had
seen
sufficient
of
the
situation
to
know
where
michael
was
most
certainly
bound
for
yet
the
very
fact
of
sylvia
s
outspoken
friendliness
with
him
made
her
wonder
a
little
as
to
what
his
reception
would
be
she
would
hardly
have
said
so
plainly
that
she
and
her
brother
were
devoted
to
him
if
she
had
been
devoted
to
him
with
that
secret
tenderness
which
in
its
essentials
is
reticent
about
itself
her
s
conversation
with
the
girl
had
given
her
a
certain
insight
into
her
still
more
had
her
attitude
when
she
stood
by
michael
as
he
played
for
her
and
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
precisely
as
she
would
have
done
if
it
had
been
another
girl
who
was
seated
at
the
piano
without
doubt
michael
had
a
real
existence
for
her
but
there
was
no
sign
whatever
that
she
hailed
it
as
a
girl
so
unmistakably
does
when
she
sees
it
as
part
of
herself
more
about
them
she
said
what
are
they
who
are
they
he
outlined
for
her
giving
the
parentage
the
mother
the
bavarian
father
sylvia
s
sudden
and
rising
in
the
musical
heaven
while
her
brother
seven
years
her
senior
had
spent
his
time
in
earning
in
order
to
give
her
the
chance
which
she
had
so
brilliantly
taken
now
it
was
to
be
his
turn
the
shackles
of
his
drudgery
no
longer
impeded
him
and
he
so
michael
radiantly
prophesied
was
to
have
his
leap
to
the
zenith
also
and
he
s
german
she
asked
yes
wasn
t
he
rude
about
my
being
a
toy
soldier
but
that
s
the
natural
german
point
of
view
i
michael
strolled
to
the
fireplace
hermann
s
so
funny
he
said
for
days
and
weeks
together
you
would
think
he
was
entirely
english
and
then
a
word
slips
from
him
like
that
which
shows
he
is
entirely
german
he
was
like
that
in
munich
when
the
emperor
appeared
and
sent
for
aunt
barbara
drew
her
chair
a
little
nearer
the
fire
and
sat
up
i
want
to
hear
about
that
she
said
but
i
ve
told
you
he
was
tremendously
friendly
in
a
national
and
that
seemed
to
you
real
she
asked
michael
considered
i
don
t
know
that
it
did
he
said
it
all
seemed
to
me
rather
feverish
i
and
he
asked
quantities
of
questions
i
think
you
hundreds
he
was
just
like
what
he
was
when
he
came
to
ashbridge
he
reviewed
the
yeomanry
and
shot
pheasants
and
spent
the
afternoon
in
a
steam
launch
apparently
studying
the
channel
of
the
river
where
it
goes
underneath
my
father
s
place
and
then
in
the
evening
there
was
a
aunt
barbara
did
not
heed
the
concert
do
you
mean
the
channel
up
from
harwich
she
asked
of
which
the
admiralty
have
the
secret
chart
i
fancy
they
have
said
michael
and
then
after
the
concert
there
was
the
torchlight
procession
with
the
bonfire
on
the
top
of
the
i
wasn
t
there
what
else
i
think
that
s
all
said
michael
but
what
are
you
driving
at
aunt
barbara
she
was
silent
a
moment
i
m
driving
at
this
she
said
the
germans
are
accumulating
a
vast
quantity
of
knowledge
about
england
tony
for
instance
has
a
german
valet
and
when
he
went
down
to
portsmouth
the
other
day
to
see
the
american
ship
that
was
there
he
took
him
with
him
and
the
man
took
a
camera
and
was
found
photographing
where
no
photography
is
allowed
did
you
see
anything
of
a
camera
when
the
emperor
came
to
ashbridge
michael
thought
yes
one
of
his
staff
was
clicking
away
all
day
he
said
he
sent
a
lot
of
them
to
my
and
we
may
presume
kept
some
copies
himself
remarked
aunt
barbara
drily
really
for
childish
simplicity
the
english
are
the
biggest
fools
in
but
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
the
germans
are
a
very
people
and
that
we
gratify
their
desires
in
a
very
simple
fashion
do
you
think
they
are
so
friendly
michael
do
you
know
for
instance
what
is
a
very
common
toast
in
german
regimental
messes
they
do
not
drink
it
when
there
are
foreigners
there
but
one
night
during
the
manoeuvres
an
officer
in
a
mess
where
tony
was
dining
got
slightly
on
as
you
may
say
and
suddenly
drank
to
der
that
means
the
day
said
michael
confidently
it
does
and
what
day
the
day
when
germany
thinks
that
all
is
ripe
for
a
war
with
us
der
tag
will
dawn
suddenly
from
a
quiet
peaceful
night
when
they
think
we
are
all
asleep
and
when
they
have
got
all
the
information
they
think
is
accessible
war
my
michael
had
never
in
his
life
seen
his
aunt
so
serious
and
he
was
amazed
at
her
gravity
there
are
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
their
spies
all
over
england
she
said
and
hundreds
of
their
agents
all
over
america
deep
patient
germany
as
carlyle
said
she
s
as
patient
as
god
and
as
deep
as
the
sea
they
are
working
working
while
our
toy
soldiers
play
golf
i
agree
with
that
adorable
pianist
and
what
s
more
i
believe
they
think
that
der
tag
is
near
to
dawn
tony
says
that
their
manoeuvres
this
year
were
like
nothing
that
has
ever
been
seen
before
germany
is
a
fighting
machine
without
parallel
in
the
history
of
the
she
got
up
and
stood
with
michael
near
the
fireplace
and
they
think
their
opportunity
is
at
hand
she
said
though
not
for
a
moment
do
they
relax
their
preparations
we
are
their
real
enemy
don
t
you
see
they
can
fight
france
with
one
hand
and
russia
with
the
other
and
in
a
few
months
time
now
they
expect
we
shall
be
in
the
throes
of
an
internal
revolution
over
this
irish
business
they
may
be
right
but
there
is
just
the
possibility
that
they
may
be
astoundingly
wrong
the
fact
of
the
great
foreign
peril
this
nightmare
this
armageddon
of
european
war
may
be
exactly
that
which
will
pull
us
together
but
their
diplomatists
anyhow
are
studying
the
irish
question
very
closely
and
german
gold
without
any
doubt
at
all
is
helping
the
home
rule
party
as
a
nation
we
are
fast
asleep
i
wonder
what
we
shall
be
like
when
we
wake
shall
we
find
ourselves
already
fettered
when
we
wake
or
will
there
be
one
moment
just
one
moment
in
which
we
can
spring
up
at
any
rate
hitherto
the
english
have
always
been
at
their
best
not
their
worst
in
desperate
positions
they
hate
exciting
themselves
and
refuse
to
do
it
until
the
crisis
is
actually
on
them
but
then
they
become
disconcertingly
serious
and
and
you
think
the
emperor
began
michael
i
think
the
emperor
is
the
hardest
worker
in
all
germany
said
barbara
i
believe
he
is
trying
and
admirably
succeeding
to
make
us
trust
his
professions
of
friendship
he
has
a
great
eye
for
detail
too
it
seemed
to
him
worth
while
to
assure
you
even
my
dear
michael
of
his
regard
and
affection
for
england
he
was
always
impressing
on
tony
the
same
thing
though
to
him
of
course
he
said
that
if
there
was
any
country
nearer
to
his
heart
than
england
it
was
america
stuff
and
nonsense
my
dear
all
this
though
struck
in
a
more
serious
key
than
was
usual
with
aunt
barbara
was
quite
characteristic
of
her
she
had
the
quality
of
mind
which
when
occupied
with
one
idea
is
occupied
with
it
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
she
worked
at
full
power
over
anything
she
took
up
but
now
she
dismissed
it
altogether
you
see
what
a
diplomatist
i
have
become
she
said
it
is
a
fascinating
business
one
lives
in
an
atmosphere
that
is
charged
with
secret
affairs
and
it
infects
one
like
the
influenza
you
catch
it
somehow
and
have
a
feverish
cold
of
your
own
and
i
am
quite
useful
to
him
you
see
i
am
such
a
chatterbox
that
people
think
i
let
out
things
by
accident
which
i
never
do
i
let
out
what
i
want
to
let
out
on
purpose
and
they
think
they
are
pumping
me
i
had
a
long
conversation
the
other
day
with
one
of
the
german
embassy
all
about
irish
affairs
they
are
hugely
interested
about
irish
affairs
and
i
just
make
a
note
of
that
but
they
can
make
as
many
notes
as
they
please
about
what
i
say
and
no
one
will
be
any
the
wiser
in
fact
they
will
be
the
foolisher
and
now
i
suppose
i
had
better
take
myself
don
t
do
anything
of
the
kind
said
michael
but
i
must
and
if
when
you
are
down
at
ashbridge
at
christmas
you
find
strangers
hanging
about
the
reach
you
might
just
let
me
know
it
s
no
use
telling
your
father
because
he
will
certainly
think
they
have
come
to
get
a
glimpse
of
him
as
he
plays
golf
but
i
expect
you
ll
be
too
busy
thinking
about
that
new
friend
of
yours
and
perhaps
his
sister
what
did
she
tell
me
we
had
got
to
do
to
her
garlands
let
us
bring
was
it
not
you
and
i
will
both
send
wreaths
michael
though
not
for
her
funeral
now
don
t
be
a
hermit
any
more
but
come
and
see
me
you
shall
take
your
garland
girl
into
dinner
if
she
will
come
too
and
her
brother
shall
certainly
sit
next
me
i
am
so
glad
you
have
become
yourself
at
last
go
on
being
yourself
more
and
more
my
dear
it
suits
chapter
viii
some
fortnight
later
and
not
long
before
michael
was
leaving
town
for
his
christmas
visit
to
ashbridge
sylvia
and
her
brother
were
lingering
in
the
big
studio
from
which
the
last
of
their
sunday
evening
guests
had
just
departed
the
usual
joyous
chaos
consequent
on
those
entertainments
reigned
the
top
of
the
piano
was
covered
with
the
plates
and
glasses
of
those
who
had
made
an
alfresco
supper
or
breakfast
of
fried
bacon
and
beer
before
leaving
a
circle
of
cushions
were
ranged
on
the
floor
round
the
fire
for
it
was
a
bitterly
cold
night
and
since
for
some
reason
a
series
of
charades
had
been
spontaneously
generated
there
was
lying
about
an
astonishing
collection
of
rugs
and
and
such
articles
of
domestic
and
household
use
as
could
be
converted
into
clothes
for
this
purpose
but
the
event
of
the
evening
had
undoubtedly
been
hermann
s
performance
of
the
wenceslas
variations
these
he
had
now
learned
and
as
he
had
promised
michael
was
going
to
play
them
at
his
concert
in
the
steinway
hall
in
january
a
good
many
musician
friends
had
attended
the
sunday
evening
gathering
and
there
had
been
no
two
opinions
about
the
success
of
them
i
was
talking
to
arthur
lagden
about
them
said
falbe
naming
a
prominent
critic
of
the
day
and
he
would
hardly
believe
that
they
were
an
opus
or
that
michael
had
not
been
studying
music
technically
for
years
instead
of
six
months
but
that
s
the
odd
thing
about
mike
he
s
so
it
was
not
unusual
for
the
brother
and
sister
to
sit
up
like
this
till
any
hour
after
their
guests
had
gone
and
sylvia
collected
a
bundle
of
cushions
and
lay
full
length
on
the
floor
with
her
feet
towards
the
fire
for
both
of
them
the
week
was
too
busy
on
six
days
for
them
to
indulge
that
companionship
sometimes
full
of
talk
sometimes
consisting
of
those
dropped
words
and
long
silences
on
which
intimacy
lives
and
they
both
enjoyed
above
all
hours
in
the
week
this
time
that
lay
between
the
friendly
riot
of
sunday
evening
and
the
starting
of
work
again
on
monday
there
was
between
them
that
bond
which
can
scarcely
exist
between
husband
and
wife
since
it
almost
necessarily
implies
the
close
consanguinity
of
brother
and
sister
and
postulates
a
certain
sort
of
essential
community
of
nature
founded
not
on
tastes
nor
even
on
affection
but
on
the
fact
that
the
same
blood
beats
in
the
two
here
an
intense
affection
too
strong
to
be
ever
demonstrative
fortified
it
and
both
brother
and
sister
talked
to
each
other
as
if
they
were
speaking
to
some
physically
independent
piece
of
themselves
sylvia
had
nothing
apparently
to
add
on
the
subject
of
michael
s
maturity
instead
she
just
raised
her
head
which
was
not
quite
high
enough
stuff
another
cushion
under
my
head
hermann
she
said
thanks
now
i
m
completely
comfortable
you
will
be
relieved
to
hermann
gazed
at
the
fire
in
silence
that
s
a
weight
off
my
mind
he
said
about
michael
now
he
s
been
suppressed
all
his
life
you
know
and
instead
of
being
dwarfed
he
has
just
gone
on
growing
inside
good
lord
i
wish
somebody
would
suppress
me
for
a
year
or
two
what
a
lot
there
would
be
when
i
took
the
cork
out
again
we
dissipate
too
much
sylvia
both
you
and
she
gave
a
little
grunt
which
from
his
knowledge
of
her
inarticulate
expressions
he
took
to
mean
dissent
i
suppose
you
mean
we
don
t
he
remarked
yes
how
much
one
dissipates
is
determined
for
one
just
as
is
the
shape
of
your
nose
or
the
colour
of
your
eyes
by
the
way
i
fell
madly
in
love
with
that
cousin
of
michael
s
who
came
with
him
he
s
the
most
attractive
creature
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
of
course
he
s
too
beautiful
no
boy
ought
to
be
as
beautiful
as
you
flirted
with
him
remarked
hermann
mike
will
probably
murder
him
on
the
way
sylvia
moved
her
feet
a
little
farther
from
the
blaze
funny
she
asked
instantly
falbe
knew
that
her
mind
was
occupied
with
exactly
the
same
question
as
his
no
not
funny
at
all
he
said
quite
serious
do
you
want
to
talk
about
it
or
not
she
gave
a
little
groan
no
i
don
t
want
to
but
i
ve
got
to
she
said
aunt
barbara
we
became
sylvia
and
aunt
barbara
an
hour
or
two
ago
and
she
s
a
dear
aunt
barbara
has
been
talking
to
me
about
it
and
what
did
aunt
barbara
say
just
what
you
are
going
to
said
sylvia
namely
that
i
had
better
make
up
my
mind
what
i
mean
to
say
when
michael
says
what
he
means
to
she
shifted
round
so
as
to
face
her
brother
as
he
stood
in
front
of
the
fire
and
pulled
his
more
neatly
over
the
top
of
his
shoe
but
what
s
to
happen
if
i
can
t
make
up
my
mind
she
said
i
needn
t
tell
you
how
much
i
like
michael
i
believe
i
like
him
as
much
as
i
possibly
can
but
i
don
t
know
if
that
is
enough
hermann
is
it
enough
you
ought
to
know
there
s
no
use
in
you
unless
you
know
about
she
put
out
her
arm
and
clasped
his
two
legs
in
the
crook
of
her
elbow
that
expressed
their
attitude
what
they
were
to
each
other
as
absolutely
as
any
physical
demonstration
allowed
had
there
not
been
the
difference
of
sex
which
severed
them
she
could
never
have
got
the
sense
of
support
that
this
physical
contact
gave
her
had
there
not
been
her
sisterhood
to
chaperon
her
so
to
speak
she
could
never
have
been
so
at
ease
with
a
man
the
two
were
without
the
physical
apexes
and
limitations
that
physical
love
must
always
bring
with
it
the
complement
of
sex
that
brought
them
so
close
annihilated
the
very
existence
of
sex
they
loved
as
only
brother
and
sister
can
love
without
trouble
the
closer
contact
of
his
trousers
to
the
calf
of
his
leg
made
hermann
step
out
of
her
encircling
arm
without
any
question
of
hurting
her
feelings
i
won
t
be
burned
he
said
sorry
but
i
won
t
be
burned
it
seems
to
me
sylvia
that
you
ought
to
like
michael
a
little
more
and
a
little
it
s
no
use
saying
what
i
ought
to
do
she
said
the
idea
of
what
i
ought
doesn
t
come
in
i
like
him
just
as
much
as
i
like
him
neither
more
nor
he
clawed
some
more
cushions
together
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
by
her
she
raised
herself
a
little
and
rested
her
body
against
his
folded
knees
what
s
the
trouble
sylvia
he
said
just
what
i
ve
been
trying
to
tell
be
more
concrete
then
you
re
definite
enough
when
you
she
sighed
and
gave
a
little
melancholy
laugh
that
s
just
it
she
said
people
like
you
and
me
and
michael
too
for
that
matter
are
most
entirely
ourselves
when
we
are
at
our
music
when
michael
plays
for
me
i
can
sing
my
soul
at
him
while
he
and
i
are
in
music
if
you
understand
and
of
course
you
do
we
belong
to
each
other
do
you
know
hermann
he
finds
me
when
i
m
singing
without
the
slightest
effort
and
even
you
as
you
have
so
often
told
me
have
to
search
and
be
on
the
lookout
and
then
the
song
is
over
and
as
somebody
says
when
the
feast
is
finished
and
the
lamps
expire
then
well
the
lamps
expire
and
he
isn
t
me
any
longer
but
michael
with
the
the
ugly
face
and
oh
isn
t
it
horrible
of
me
the
long
arms
and
the
little
stumpy
legs
if
only
he
was
rather
different
in
things
that
don
t
matter
that
can
t
matter
but
but
hermann
if
only
michael
was
rather
like
you
and
you
like
michael
i
should
love
you
exactly
as
much
as
ever
and
i
should
love
michael
she
was
leaning
forward
and
with
both
hands
was
very
carefully
tying
and
untying
one
of
hermann
s
shoelaces
oh
thank
goodness
there
is
somebody
in
the
world
to
whom
i
can
say
just
whatever
i
feel
and
know
he
understands
she
said
and
i
know
this
too
and
follow
me
here
hermann
i
know
that
all
that
doesn
t
really
matter
i
am
sure
it
doesn
t
i
like
michael
far
too
well
to
let
it
matter
but
there
are
other
things
which
i
don
t
see
my
way
through
and
they
are
much
more
real
she
was
silent
again
so
long
that
hermann
reached
out
for
a
cigarette
lit
it
and
threw
away
the
match
before
she
spoke
there
is
michael
s
position
she
said
when
michael
asks
me
if
i
will
have
him
as
we
both
know
he
is
going
to
do
i
shall
have
to
make
conditions
i
won
t
give
up
my
career
i
must
go
on
working
in
other
words
singing
whether
i
marry
him
or
not
i
don
t
call
it
singing
in
my
sense
of
the
word
to
sing
the
banks
of
allan
water
to
michael
and
his
father
and
mother
at
ashbridge
any
more
than
it
is
being
a
politician
to
read
the
morning
papers
and
argue
about
the
irish
question
with
you
to
have
a
career
in
politics
means
that
you
must
be
a
member
of
parliament
i
daresay
the
house
of
lords
would
do
and
make
speeches
and
stand
the
racket
in
the
same
way
to
be
a
singer
doesn
t
mean
to
sing
after
dinner
or
to
go
squawking
anyhow
in
a
workhouse
but
it
means
to
get
up
on
a
platform
before
critical
people
and
if
you
don
t
do
your
very
best
be
damned
by
them
if
i
marry
michael
i
must
go
on
singing
as
a
professional
singer
and
not
become
an
amateur
the
viscountess
comber
who
sings
so
charmingly
i
refuse
to
sing
charmingly
i
will
either
sing
properly
or
not
at
all
and
i
couldn
t
not
sing
i
shall
have
to
continue
being
miss
falbe
so
to
you
say
you
insist
on
it
said
hermann
but
whether
you
did
or
not
there
is
nothing
more
certain
than
that
michael
i
am
sure
he
would
but
by
so
doing
he
would
certainly
quarrel
irrevocably
with
his
people
even
aunt
barbara
who
after
all
is
very
liberally
minded
sees
that
they
can
none
of
them
not
even
she
who
are
born
to
a
certain
tradition
imagine
that
there
are
other
traditions
quite
as
michael
it
is
true
was
born
to
one
tradition
but
he
has
got
the
other
as
he
has
shown
very
clearly
by
refusing
to
disobey
it
he
will
certainly
as
you
say
insist
on
my
endorsing
the
resolution
he
has
made
for
himself
what
it
comes
to
is
this
that
i
can
t
marry
him
without
his
father
s
complete
consent
to
all
that
i
have
told
you
i
can
t
have
my
career
disregarded
covered
up
with
awkward
silences
alluded
to
as
a
painful
subject
and
as
i
say
even
aunt
barbara
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
if
i
became
lady
comber
i
should
cease
to
be
miss
falbe
well
there
she
s
wrong
my
dear
i
shall
continue
to
be
miss
falbe
whether
i
m
lady
comber
or
lady
ashbridge
or
the
duchess
of
anything
you
please
and
here
the
difficulty
really
comes
in
they
must
all
see
how
right
i
am
difficulty
did
i
say
it
s
more
like
an
hermann
threw
the
end
of
his
cigarette
into
the
ashes
of
the
dying
fire
it
s
clear
then
he
said
you
have
made
up
your
mind
not
to
marry
she
shook
her
head
oh
hermann
you
fail
me
she
said
if
i
had
made
up
my
mind
not
to
i
shouldn
t
have
kept
you
up
an
hour
talking
about
he
stretched
his
hands
out
towards
the
embers
already
coated
with
grey
ash
then
it
s
like
that
with
you
he
said
pointing
if
there
is
the
fire
in
you
it
is
covered
up
with
she
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
i
think
you
ve
hit
it
there
she
said
i
believe
there
is
the
fire
when
as
i
said
he
plays
for
me
i
know
there
is
but
the
ashes
what
are
they
and
who
shall
disperse
them
for
me
she
stood
up
swiftly
drawing
herself
to
her
full
height
and
stretching
her
arms
out
there
s
something
bigger
than
we
know
coming
she
said
whether
it
s
storm
or
sunshine
i
have
no
idea
but
there
will
be
something
that
shall
utterly
sever
michael
and
me
or
utterly
unite
do
you
care
which
it
is
he
asked
yes
i
care
said
she
he
held
out
his
hands
to
her
and
she
pulled
him
up
to
his
feet
what
are
you
going
to
say
then
when
he
asks
you
he
said
tell
him
he
must
he
went
round
the
room
putting
out
the
electric
lamps
and
opening
the
big
skylight
in
the
roof
there
was
a
curtain
in
front
of
this
which
he
pulled
aside
and
from
the
frosty
cloudless
heavens
the
starshine
of
a
thousand
constellations
filtered
down
that
s
a
lot
to
ask
of
any
man
he
said
if
you
care
you
and
if
you
were
a
girl
you
would
know
exactly
what
i
mean
she
said
they
may
know
they
care
but
unless
they
are
marrying
for
perfectly
different
reasons
they
have
to
feel
to
the
end
of
their
fingers
that
they
care
before
they
can
say
he
opened
the
door
for
her
to
pass
out
and
they
walked
up
the
passage
together
well
perhaps
michael
won
t
ask
you
he
said
in
which
case
all
bother
will
be
saved
and
we
shall
have
sat
up
talking
till
sylvia
did
you
know
it
is
nearly
three
sat
up
talking
for
nothing
sylvia
considered
this
fiddlesticks
she
said
and
hermann
was
inclined
to
agree
with
her
this
view
of
the
case
found
confirmation
next
day
for
michael
after
his
music
lesson
lingered
so
firmly
and
determinedly
when
the
three
chatted
together
over
the
fire
that
in
the
end
hermann
found
nothing
to
do
but
to
leave
them
together
sylvia
had
given
him
no
sign
as
to
whether
she
wished
him
to
absent
himself
or
not
and
he
concluded
since
she
did
not
put
an
end
to
things
by
going
away
herself
that
she
intended
michael
to
have
his
say
the
latter
rose
as
the
door
closed
behind
hermann
and
came
and
stood
in
front
of
her
and
at
the
moment
sylvia
could
notice
nothing
of
him
except
his
heaviness
his
plainness
all
the
things
that
she
had
told
herself
before
did
not
really
matter
now
her
sensation
contradicted
that
she
was
conscious
that
the
ash
somehow
had
vastly
accumulated
over
her
fire
that
all
her
affection
and
regard
for
him
were
suddenly
eclipsed
this
was
a
complete
surprise
to
her
for
the
moment
she
found
michael
s
presence
and
his
proximity
to
her
simply
distasteful
i
thought
hermann
was
never
going
he
said
for
a
second
or
two
she
did
not
reply
it
was
clearly
no
use
to
continue
the
ordinary
banter
of
conversation
to
suggest
that
as
the
room
was
hermann
s
he
might
conceivably
be
conceded
the
right
to
stop
there
if
he
chose
there
was
no
transition
possible
between
the
affairs
of
every
day
and
the
affair
for
which
michael
had
stopped
to
speak
she
gave
up
all
attempt
to
make
one
instead
she
just
helped
him
what
is
it
michael
she
asked
then
to
her
at
any
rate
michael
s
face
completely
changed
there
burned
in
it
all
of
a
sudden
the
full
glow
of
that
of
which
she
had
only
seen
glimpses
you
know
he
said
his
shyness
his
awkwardness
had
all
vanished
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
offer
to
her
all
that
he
had
to
offer
and
he
did
it
with
the
charm
of
perfect
manliness
and
simplicity
whether
you
can
accept
me
or
not
he
said
i
have
just
to
tell
you
that
i
am
entirely
yours
is
there
any
chance
for
me
sylvia
he
stood
quite
still
making
no
movement
towards
her
she
on
her
side
found
all
her
distaste
of
him
suddenly
vanished
in
the
mere
solemnity
of
the
occasion
his
very
quietness
told
her
better
than
any
protestations
could
have
done
of
the
quality
of
what
he
offered
and
that
quality
vastly
transcended
all
that
she
had
known
or
guessed
of
him
i
don
t
know
michael
she
said
at
length
she
came
a
step
forward
and
without
any
sense
of
embarrassment
found
that
she
without
conscious
intention
had
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
the
moment
that
was
done
she
was
conscious
of
the
impulse
that
made
her
do
it
it
expressed
what
she
felt
yes
i
feel
like
that
to
you
she
said
you
re
a
dear
i
expect
you
know
how
fond
i
am
of
you
and
if
you
don
t
i
assure
you
of
it
now
but
i
have
got
to
give
you
more
than
michael
looked
up
at
her
yes
sylvia
he
said
much
more
than
a
few
minutes
ago
only
she
had
not
liked
him
at
all
now
she
liked
him
immensely
but
how
michael
she
asked
how
can
i
find
it
oh
it
s
i
who
have
got
to
find
it
for
you
he
said
that
is
to
say
if
you
want
it
to
be
found
do
you
she
looked
at
him
gravely
without
the
tremor
of
a
smile
in
her
eyes
what
does
that
mean
exactly
she
said
it
is
very
simple
do
you
want
to
love
me
she
did
not
move
her
hands
they
still
rested
on
his
shoulders
like
things
at
ease
like
things
at
home
yes
i
suppose
i
want
to
she
said
and
is
that
the
most
you
can
do
for
me
at
present
he
asked
that
reached
her
again
all
the
time
the
plain
words
the
plain
face
the
quiet
of
him
stabbed
her
with
daggers
of
which
he
had
no
idea
she
was
dismayed
at
the
recollection
of
her
talk
with
her
brother
the
evening
before
of
the
ease
and
certitude
with
which
she
had
laid
down
her
conditions
of
not
giving
up
her
career
of
remaining
the
famous
miss
falbe
of
refusing
to
take
a
dishonoured
place
in
the
sacred
circle
of
the
combers
now
when
she
was
face
to
face
with
his
love
so
ineloquently
expressed
so
radically
a
part
of
him
she
knew
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
external
to
him
and
her
that
could
enter
into
their
reckonings
but
into
their
reckonings
there
had
not
entered
the
one
thing
essential
she
gave
him
sympathy
liking
friendliness
but
she
did
not
want
him
with
her
blood
and
though
it
was
not
humanly
possible
that
she
could
want
him
with
more
than
that
it
was
not
possible
that
she
could
take
him
with
less
yes
that
is
the
most
i
can
do
for
you
at
present
she
said
still
quite
quietly
he
moved
away
from
her
so
that
he
stood
free
of
her
hands
i
have
been
constantly
here
all
these
last
months
he
said
now
that
you
know
what
i
have
told
you
do
you
want
not
to
see
me
that
stabbed
her
again
have
i
implied
that
she
asked
not
directly
but
i
can
easily
understand
its
being
a
bore
to
you
i
don
t
want
to
bore
you
that
would
be
a
very
stupid
way
of
trying
to
make
you
care
for
me
as
i
said
that
is
my
job
i
haven
t
accomplished
it
as
yet
but
i
mean
to
i
only
ask
you
for
a
she
understood
her
own
feeling
better
than
he
she
understood
at
least
that
she
was
dealing
with
things
that
were
necessarily
incalculable
i
can
t
give
you
a
hint
she
said
i
can
t
make
any
plans
about
it
if
you
were
a
woman
perhaps
you
would
understand
love
is
or
it
isn
t
that
is
all
i
know
about
but
michael
persisted
i
only
know
what
you
have
taught
me
he
said
but
you
must
know
in
a
flash
she
became
aware
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
behave
to
michael
as
she
had
behaved
to
him
for
several
months
past
she
could
not
any
longer
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
beat
time
with
her
fingers
on
his
arm
knowing
that
the
physical
contact
meant
nothing
to
her
and
all
all
to
him
the
rejection
of
him
as
a
lover
rendered
the
sisterly
attitude
impossible
and
not
only
must
she
revise
her
conduct
but
she
must
revise
the
mental
attitude
of
which
it
was
the
physical
counterpart
up
till
this
moment
she
had
looked
at
the
situation
from
her
own
side
only
had
felt
that
no
plans
could
be
made
that
the
natural
thing
was
to
go
on
as
before
with
the
intimacy
that
she
liked
and
the
familiarity
that
was
the
obvious
expression
of
it
but
now
she
began
to
see
the
question
from
his
side
she
could
not
go
on
doing
that
which
meant
nothing
particular
to
her
if
that
insouciance
meant
something
so
very
particular
to
him
she
realised
that
if
she
had
loved
him
the
touch
of
his
hand
the
proximity
of
his
face
would
have
had
significance
for
her
a
significance
that
would
have
been
intolerable
unless
there
was
something
mutual
and
secret
between
them
it
had
seemed
so
easy
in
anticipation
to
tell
him
that
he
must
wait
so
simple
for
him
just
well
just
to
wait
until
she
could
make
up
her
mind
she
believed
as
she
had
told
her
brother
that
she
cared
for
michael
or
as
she
had
told
him
that
she
wanted
to
the
two
were
to
the
girl
s
mind
identical
though
expressed
to
each
in
the
only
terms
that
were
possible
but
until
she
came
face
to
face
with
the
picture
of
the
future
that
to
her
wore
the
same
outline
and
colour
as
the
past
she
had
not
known
the
impossibility
of
such
a
presentment
the
desire
of
the
lover
on
michael
s
part
rendered
unthinkable
the
sisterly
attitude
on
hers
that
her
instinct
told
her
but
her
reason
revolted
against
it
can
t
we
go
on
as
we
were
michael
she
said
he
looked
at
her
incredulously
oh
no
of
course
not
that
he
said
she
moved
a
step
towards
him
i
can
t
think
of
you
in
any
other
way
she
said
as
if
making
an
appeal
he
stood
absolutely
unresponsive
something
within
him
longed
that
she
should
advance
a
step
more
that
he
should
again
have
the
touch
of
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
but
another
instinct
stronger
than
that
made
him
revoke
his
desire
and
if
she
had
moved
again
he
would
certainly
have
fallen
back
before
her
it
may
seem
ridiculous
to
you
he
said
since
you
do
not
care
but
i
can
t
do
that
does
that
seem
absurd
to
you
i
i
am
afraid
it
does
but
that
is
because
you
don
t
understand
by
all
means
let
us
be
what
they
call
excellent
friends
but
there
are
certain
little
things
which
seem
nothing
to
you
and
they
mean
so
much
to
me
i
can
t
explain
it
s
just
the
brotherly
relation
which
i
can
t
stand
it
s
no
use
suggesting
that
we
should
be
as
we
were
before
she
understood
well
enough
for
his
purposes
i
see
she
said
michael
paused
for
a
moment
i
think
i
ll
be
going
now
he
said
i
am
off
to
ashbridge
in
two
days
give
hermann
my
love
and
a
jolly
christmas
to
you
both
i
ll
let
you
know
when
i
am
back
in
she
had
no
reply
to
this
she
saw
its
justice
and
acquiesced
then
said
michael
he
walked
home
from
chelsea
in
that
utterly
blank
and
unfeeling
consciousness
which
almost
invariably
is
the
sequel
of
any
event
that
brings
with
it
a
change
of
attitude
towards
life
generally
not
for
a
moment
did
he
tell
himself
that
he
had
been
awakened
from
a
dream
or
abandon
his
conviction
that
his
dream
was
to
be
made
real
the
rare
quiet
determination
that
had
made
him
give
up
his
stereotyped
mode
of
life
in
the
summer
and
take
to
music
was
still
completely
his
and
if
anything
it
had
been
reinforced
by
sylvia
s
emphatic
statement
that
she
wanted
to
only
her
imagining
that
their
old
relations
could
go
on
showed
him
how
far
she
was
from
knowing
what
to
care
meant
at
first
without
knowing
it
but
with
a
gradually
increasing
keenness
of
consciousness
he
had
become
aware
that
this
sisterly
attitude
of
hers
towards
him
had
meant
so
infinitely
much
because
he
had
taken
it
to
be
the
prelude
to
something
more
now
he
saw
that
it
was
so
to
speak
a
piece
complete
in
itself
it
bore
no
relation
to
what
he
had
imagined
it
would
lead
into
no
curtain
went
up
when
the
prelude
was
over
the
curtain
remained
inexorably
hanging
there
not
acknowledging
the
prelude
at
all
not
for
a
moment
did
he
accuse
her
of
encouraging
him
to
have
thought
so
she
had
but
given
him
a
frankness
of
comradeship
that
meant
to
her
exactly
what
it
expressed
but
he
had
thought
otherwise
he
had
imagined
that
it
would
grow
towards
a
culmination
all
that
and
here
was
the
change
that
made
his
mind
blank
and
unfeeling
had
to
be
cut
away
and
with
it
all
the
budding
branches
that
his
imagination
had
pictured
as
springing
from
it
he
could
not
be
comrade
to
her
as
he
was
to
her
brother
the
inexorable
demands
of
sex
forbade
it
he
went
briskly
enough
through
the
clean
dry
streets
the
frost
of
last
night
had
held
throughout
the
morning
and
the
sunlight
sparkled
with
a
rare
and
seasonable
brightness
of
a
traditional
christmas
weather
hecatombs
of
turkeys
hung
in
the
poulterers
windows
among
sprigs
of
holly
and
shops
were
bright
with
children
s
toys
the
briskness
of
the
day
had
flushed
the
colour
into
the
faces
of
the
passengers
in
the
street
and
the
festive
air
of
the
imminent
holiday
was
abroad
all
this
michael
noticed
with
a
sense
of
detachment
what
had
happened
had
caused
a
veil
to
fall
between
himself
and
external
things
it
was
as
if
he
was
sealed
into
some
glass
cage
and
had
no
contact
with
what
passed
round
him
this
lasted
throughout
his
walk
and
when
he
let
himself
into
his
flat
it
was
with
the
same
sense
of
alienation
that
he
found
his
cousin
francis
gracefully
reclining
on
the
sofa
that
he
had
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
fire
francis
was
inclined
to
be
querulous
i
was
just
wondering
whether
i
should
give
you
up
he
said
the
hour
that
you
named
for
lunch
was
one
and
i
have
almost
forgotten
what
your
clock
sounded
like
when
it
struck
this
also
seemed
to
matter
very
little
did
i
ask
you
to
lunch
he
said
i
really
quite
forgot
i
can
t
even
remember
doing
it
but
there
will
be
lunch
asked
francis
rather
anxiously
of
course
it
ll
be
ready
in
ten
michael
came
and
stood
in
front
of
the
fire
and
looked
with
a
sudden
spasm
of
envy
on
the
handsome
boy
who
lay
there
if
he
himself
had
been
anything
like
that
i
was
distinctly
chippy
this
morning
remarked
francis
and
so
i
didn
t
so
much
mind
waiting
for
lunch
i
attribute
it
to
too
much
beer
and
bacon
last
night
at
your
friend
s
house
i
enjoyed
it
i
mean
the
evening
and
for
that
matter
the
bacon
at
the
time
it
really
was
extremely
he
yawned
largely
and
openly
i
had
no
idea
you
could
frolic
like
that
mike
he
said
it
was
quite
a
new
light
on
your
character
how
did
you
learn
to
do
it
it
s
quite
a
new
here
again
the
veil
was
drawn
was
it
last
night
only
that
falbe
had
played
the
variations
and
that
they
had
acted
charades
francis
proceeded
in
bland
unconsciousness
i
didn
t
know
germans
could
be
so
jolly
he
continued
as
a
rule
i
don
t
like
germans
when
they
try
to
be
jolly
they
generally
only
succeed
in
being
but
of
course
your
friend
is
can
t
he
play
too
and
to
think
of
your
having
written
those
ripping
tunes
his
sister
too
no
wonder
we
haven
t
seen
much
of
you
mike
if
that
s
where
you
ve
been
spending
your
time
she
s
rather
like
the
new
girl
at
the
gaiety
but
handsomer
i
like
big
girls
don
t
you
oh
i
forgot
you
don
t
like
girls
much
anyhow
but
are
you
learning
your
mistake
mike
you
looked
last
night
as
if
you
were
getting
more
michael
moved
away
impatiently
oh
shut
it
francis
he
observed
francis
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
why
what
s
up
he
asked
won
t
she
turn
a
favourable
eye
michael
wheeled
round
savagely
please
remember
you
are
talking
about
a
lady
and
not
a
gaiety
lady
he
remarked
this
brought
francis
to
his
feet
sorry
he
said
i
was
only
indulging
in
badinage
until
lunch
was
michael
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
tell
his
cousin
what
had
happened
but
he
was
aware
of
having
spoken
more
strongly
than
the
situation
as
francis
knew
of
it
justified
let
s
have
lunch
then
he
said
we
shall
be
better
after
lunch
as
one
s
nurse
used
to
say
and
are
you
coming
to
ashbridge
francis
yes
i
ve
been
talking
to
aunt
bar
about
it
this
morning
we
re
both
coming
the
family
is
going
to
rally
round
you
mike
and
defend
you
from
uncle
robert
there
s
sure
to
be
some
duck
shooting
too
isn
t
there
this
was
a
considerable
relief
to
michael
oh
that
s
ripping
he
said
you
and
aunt
barbara
always
make
me
feel
that
there
s
a
good
deal
of
amusement
to
be
extracted
from
the
to
be
sure
there
is
isn
t
that
what
the
world
is
for
lunch
and
amusement
and
dinner
and
amusement
aunt
bar
told
me
she
dined
with
you
the
other
night
and
had
a
quantity
of
amusement
as
well
as
an
excellent
dinner
she
hinted
oh
aunt
barbara
s
always
hinting
said
michael
i
know
after
all
everything
that
isn
t
hints
is
obvious
and
so
there
s
nothing
to
say
about
it
tell
me
more
about
the
falbes
mike
will
they
let
me
go
there
again
do
you
think
was
i
popular
don
t
tell
me
if
i
wasn
michael
smiled
at
this
egoism
that
could
not
help
being
charming
would
you
care
if
you
weren
t
he
asked
very
much
one
naturally
wants
to
please
delightful
people
and
i
think
they
are
both
delightful
especially
the
girl
but
then
she
starts
with
the
tremendous
advantage
of
being
of
being
a
girl
i
believe
you
are
in
love
with
her
mike
just
as
i
am
it
s
that
which
makes
you
so
grumpy
but
then
you
never
do
fall
in
love
it
s
a
pity
you
miss
a
lot
of
jolly
michael
felt
a
sudden
overwhelming
desire
to
make
francis
stop
this
maddening
twaddle
also
the
events
of
the
morning
were
beginning
to
take
on
an
air
of
reality
and
as
this
grew
he
felt
the
need
of
sympathy
of
some
kind
francis
might
not
be
able
to
give
him
anything
that
was
of
any
use
but
it
would
do
no
harm
to
see
if
his
cousin
s
buoyant
unconscious
philosophy
which
made
life
so
exciting
and
pleasant
a
thing
to
him
would
in
any
way
help
besides
he
must
stop
this
light
banter
which
was
like
drawing
plaster
off
a
sore
and
unhealed
wound
you
re
quite
right
he
said
i
am
in
love
with
her
furthermore
i
asked
her
to
marry
me
this
this
certainly
had
an
effect
good
lord
said
francis
and
do
you
mean
to
say
she
refused
you
she
didn
t
accept
me
said
michael
we
we
but
why
on
earth
didn
t
she
take
you
asked
francis
all
michael
s
old
sensitiveness
his
of
his
plainness
his
awkwardness
his
big
hands
his
short
legs
came
back
to
him
i
should
think
you
could
see
well
enough
if
you
look
at
me
he
said
without
my
telling
oh
that
silly
old
rot
said
francis
cheerfully
i
thought
you
had
forgotten
all
about
i
almost
had
in
fact
i
quite
had
until
this
morning
said
michael
if
i
had
remembered
it
i
shouldn
t
have
asked
he
corrected
himself
no
i
don
t
think
that
s
true
he
said
i
should
have
asked
her
anyhow
but
i
should
have
been
prepared
for
her
not
to
take
me
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
wasn
francis
turned
sideways
to
the
table
throwing
one
leg
over
the
other
that
s
nonsense
he
said
it
doesn
t
matter
whether
a
man
s
ugly
or
it
doesn
t
as
long
as
he
is
not
remarked
michael
grimly
it
doesn
t
matter
much
in
any
case
we
re
all
ugly
compared
to
girls
and
why
ever
they
should
consent
to
marry
any
of
us
awful
hairy
things
smelling
of
smoke
and
drink
is
more
than
i
can
make
out
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
do
they
don
t
mind
what
we
look
like
what
they
care
about
is
whether
we
want
them
of
course
there
are
exceptions
you
see
one
said
michael
no
i
don
t
good
lord
you
ve
only
asked
her
once
you
ve
got
to
make
yourself
felt
you
re
not
intending
to
give
up
are
you
i
couldn
t
give
well
then
just
hold
on
she
likes
you
doesn
t
she
certainly
said
michael
without
hesitation
but
that
s
a
long
way
from
the
other
it
s
on
the
same
michael
got
up
it
may
be
he
said
but
it
strikes
me
it
s
round
the
corner
you
can
t
even
see
one
from
the
possibly
not
but
you
never
know
how
near
the
corner
really
is
go
for
her
mike
full
speed
but
how
oh
there
are
hundreds
of
ways
i
m
not
sure
that
one
of
the
best
isn
t
to
keep
away
for
a
bit
even
if
she
doesn
t
want
you
just
now
when
you
are
there
she
may
get
to
want
you
when
you
aren
t
i
don
t
think
i
should
go
on
the
mournful
byronic
plan
if
i
were
you
i
don
t
think
it
would
suit
your
style
you
re
too
heavily
built
to
stand
leaning
against
the
gazing
at
her
and
dishevelling
your
michael
could
not
help
laughing
oh
for
god
s
sake
don
t
make
a
joke
of
it
he
said
why
not
it
isn
t
a
tragedy
yet
it
won
t
be
a
tragedy
till
she
marries
somebody
else
or
definitely
says
no
and
until
a
thing
is
proved
to
be
tragic
the
best
way
to
deal
with
it
is
to
treat
it
like
a
comedy
which
is
going
to
end
well
it
s
only
the
second
act
now
you
see
when
everything
gets
into
a
mess
by
the
merciful
decrees
of
providence
you
see
girls
on
the
whole
want
us
as
much
as
we
want
them
that
s
what
makes
it
all
so
michael
went
down
next
day
to
ashbridge
where
aunt
barbara
and
francis
were
to
follow
the
day
after
and
found
after
the
freedom
and
interests
of
the
last
six
months
that
the
pompous
formal
life
was
more
intolerable
than
ever
he
was
clearly
in
disgrace
still
as
was
made
quite
clear
to
him
by
his
father
s
icy
and
awful
politeness
when
it
was
necessary
to
speak
to
him
and
by
his
utter
unconsciousness
of
his
presence
when
it
was
not
this
he
had
expected
christmas
had
ushered
in
a
truce
in
which
no
guns
were
discharged
but
remained
sighted
and
pointed
ready
to
fire
but
though
there
was
no
change
in
his
father
his
mother
seemed
to
michael
to
be
curiously
altered
her
mind
which
as
has
been
already
noticed
was
usually
in
a
stunned
condition
seemed
to
have
awakened
like
a
child
from
its
sleep
and
to
have
begun
vaguely
crying
in
an
inarticulate
discomfort
it
was
true
that
petsy
was
no
more
having
succumbed
to
a
bilious
attack
of
unusual
severity
but
a
second
petsy
had
already
taken
her
place
and
lady
ashbridge
sat
with
him
it
was
a
gentleman
petsy
this
time
in
her
lap
as
before
and
occasionally
shed
a
tear
or
two
over
petsy
ii
in
memory
of
petsy
i
but
this
did
not
seem
to
account
for
the
wakening
up
of
her
mind
and
emotions
into
this
state
of
depression
and
anxiety
it
was
as
if
all
her
life
she
had
been
quietly
dozing
in
the
sun
and
that
the
place
where
she
sat
had
passed
into
the
shade
and
she
had
awoke
cold
and
shivering
from
a
bitter
wind
she
had
become
far
more
talkative
and
though
she
had
by
no
means
abandoned
her
habit
of
upsetting
any
conversation
by
the
extreme
obviousness
of
her
remarks
she
asked
many
more
questions
and
as
michael
noticed
often
repeated
a
question
to
which
she
had
received
an
answer
only
a
few
minutes
before
during
dinner
michael
constantly
found
her
looking
at
him
in
a
shy
and
eager
manner
removing
her
gaze
when
she
found
it
was
observed
and
when
later
after
a
silent
cigarette
with
his
father
in
the
during
which
lord
ashbridge
with
some
ostentation
studied
an
army
list
michael
went
to
his
bedroom
he
was
utterly
astonished
when
he
gave
a
come
in
to
a
tapping
at
his
door
to
see
his
mother
enter
her
maid
was
standing
behind
her
holding
the
inevitable
petsy
and
she
herself
hovered
hesitatingly
in
the
doorway
i
heard
you
come
up
michael
she
said
and
i
wondered
if
it
would
annoy
you
if
i
came
in
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
but
i
won
t
come
in
if
it
would
annoy
you
i
only
thought
i
should
like
a
little
chat
with
you
quietly
secure
from
michael
instantly
got
up
from
the
chair
in
front
of
his
fire
in
which
he
had
already
begun
to
see
images
of
sylvia
this
intrusion
of
his
mother
s
was
a
thing
utterly
unprecedented
and
somehow
he
at
once
connected
its
innovation
with
the
strange
manner
he
had
remarked
already
but
there
was
complete
cordiality
in
his
welcome
and
he
wheeled
up
a
chair
for
her
but
by
all
means
come
in
mother
he
said
i
was
not
going
to
bed
lady
ashbridge
looked
round
for
her
maid
and
will
petsy
not
annoy
you
if
he
sits
quietly
on
my
knee
she
asked
of
course
lady
ashbridge
took
the
dog
there
that
is
nice
she
said
i
told
them
to
see
you
had
a
good
fire
on
this
cold
night
has
it
been
very
cold
in
london
this
question
had
already
been
asked
and
answered
twice
now
for
the
third
time
michael
admitted
the
severity
of
the
weather
i
hope
you
wrap
up
well
she
said
i
should
be
sorry
if
you
caught
cold
and
so
i
am
sure
your
father
would
be
i
wish
you
could
make
up
your
mind
not
to
vex
him
any
more
but
go
back
into
the
i
m
afraid
that
s
impossible
mother
he
said
well
if
it
s
impossible
there
is
no
use
in
saying
anything
more
about
it
but
it
vexed
him
very
much
he
is
still
vexed
with
you
i
wish
he
was
not
vexed
it
is
a
sad
thing
when
father
and
son
fall
out
but
you
do
wrap
up
i
hope
in
the
cold
weather
michael
felt
a
sudden
pang
of
anxiety
and
alarm
each
separate
thing
that
his
mother
said
was
sensible
enough
but
in
the
sum
they
were
nonsense
you
have
been
in
london
since
september
she
went
on
that
is
a
long
time
to
be
in
london
tell
me
about
your
life
there
do
you
work
hard
not
too
hard
i
hope
no
hard
enough
to
keep
me
busy
he
said
tell
me
about
it
all
i
am
afraid
i
have
not
been
a
very
good
mother
to
you
i
have
not
entered
into
your
life
enough
i
want
to
do
so
now
but
i
don
t
think
you
ever
wanted
to
confide
in
me
it
is
sad
when
sons
don
t
confide
in
their
mothers
but
i
daresay
it
was
my
fault
and
now
i
know
so
little
about
she
paused
a
moment
stroking
her
dog
s
ears
which
twitched
under
her
touch
i
hope
you
are
happy
michael
she
said
i
don
t
think
i
am
so
happy
as
i
used
to
be
but
don
t
tell
your
father
i
feel
sure
he
does
not
notice
it
and
it
would
vex
him
but
i
want
you
to
be
happy
you
used
not
to
be
when
you
were
little
you
were
always
sensitive
and
queer
but
you
do
seem
happier
now
and
that
s
a
good
here
again
this
was
all
sensible
when
taken
in
bits
but
its
aspect
was
different
when
considered
together
she
looked
at
michael
anxiously
a
moment
and
then
drew
her
chair
closer
to
him
laying
her
thin
veined
hand
sparkling
with
many
rings
on
his
knee
but
it
wasn
t
i
who
made
you
happier
she
said
and
that
s
so
dreadful
i
never
made
anybody
happy
your
father
always
made
himself
happy
and
he
liked
being
himself
but
i
suspect
you
haven
t
liked
being
yourself
poor
michael
but
now
that
you
re
living
the
life
you
chose
which
vexes
your
father
is
it
better
with
you
the
shyness
had
gone
from
the
gaze
that
he
had
seen
her
direct
at
him
at
dinner
which
fugitively
fluttered
away
when
she
saw
that
it
was
observed
and
now
that
it
was
bent
so
unwaveringly
on
him
he
saw
shining
through
it
what
he
had
never
seen
before
namely
the
which
he
had
missed
all
his
life
now
for
the
first
time
he
saw
it
recognising
it
as
by
divination
when
with
ray
serene
and
untroubled
it
burst
through
the
mists
that
seemed
to
hang
about
his
mother
s
mind
before
noticing
her
change
of
manner
her
restless
questions
he
had
been
vaguely
alarmed
and
as
they
went
on
the
alarm
had
become
more
pronounced
but
at
this
moment
when
there
shone
forth
the
which
had
never
come
out
or
blossomed
in
her
life
but
had
been
overlaid
completely
with
routine
and
conventionality
rendering
it
too
indolent
to
put
forth
petals
michael
had
no
thought
but
for
that
which
she
had
never
given
him
yet
and
which
now
it
began
to
expand
before
him
he
knew
he
had
missed
all
his
life
she
took
up
his
big
hand
that
lay
on
his
knee
and
began
timidly
stroking
it
since
you
have
been
away
she
said
and
since
your
father
has
been
vexed
with
you
i
have
begun
to
see
how
lonely
you
must
have
been
what
taught
me
that
i
am
afraid
was
only
that
i
have
begun
to
feel
lonely
too
nobody
wants
me
even
petsy
when
she
died
didn
t
want
me
to
be
near
her
and
then
it
began
to
strike
me
that
perhaps
you
might
want
me
there
was
no
one
else
and
who
should
want
me
if
my
son
did
not
i
never
gave
you
the
chance
before
god
forgive
me
and
now
perhaps
it
is
too
late
you
have
learned
to
do
without
that
was
bitterly
true
the
truth
of
it
stabbed
michael
on
his
side
as
he
knew
he
had
made
no
effort
either
or
if
he
had
they
had
been
but
childish
efforts
easily
repulsed
he
had
not
troubled
about
it
and
if
she
was
to
blame
the
blame
was
his
also
she
had
been
slow
to
show
the
but
he
had
been
just
as
wanting
in
the
tenderness
of
the
son
he
was
profoundly
touched
by
this
humble
timidity
by
the
sincerity
vague
but
unquestionable
that
lay
behind
it
it
s
never
too
late
is
it
he
said
bending
down
and
kissing
the
thin
white
hands
that
held
his
we
are
in
time
after
all
aren
t
we
she
gave
a
little
shiver
oh
don
t
kiss
my
hands
michael
she
said
it
hurts
me
that
you
should
do
that
but
it
is
sweet
of
you
to
say
that
i
am
not
too
late
after
all
michael
may
i
just
take
you
in
my
arms
may
i
he
half
rose
oh
mother
how
can
you
ask
he
said
then
let
me
do
it
no
my
darling
don
t
move
just
sit
still
as
you
are
and
let
me
just
get
my
arms
about
you
and
put
my
head
on
your
shoulder
and
hold
me
close
like
that
for
a
moment
so
that
i
can
realise
that
i
am
not
too
she
got
up
and
leaning
over
him
held
him
so
for
a
moment
pressing
her
cheek
close
to
his
and
kissing
him
on
the
eyes
and
on
the
mouth
ah
that
is
nice
she
said
it
makes
my
loneliness
fall
away
from
me
i
am
not
quite
alone
any
more
and
now
if
you
are
not
tired
will
you
let
me
talk
to
you
a
little
more
and
learn
a
little
more
about
you
she
pulled
her
chair
again
nearer
him
so
that
sitting
there
she
could
clasp
his
arm
i
want
your
happiness
dear
she
said
but
there
is
so
little
now
that
i
can
do
to
secure
it
i
must
put
that
into
other
hands
you
are
michael
you
are
old
enough
to
get
married
all
combers
marry
when
they
are
don
t
they
isn
t
there
some
girl
you
would
like
to
be
yours
but
you
must
love
her
you
know
you
must
want
her
you
mustn
t
be
able
to
do
without
her
it
won
t
do
to
marry
just
because
you
are
it
would
no
more
have
entered
into
michael
s
head
this
morning
to
tell
to
his
mother
about
sylvia
than
to
have
discussed
counterpoint
with
her
but
then
this
morning
he
had
not
been
really
aware
that
he
had
a
mother
but
to
tell
her
now
was
not
unthinkable
but
inevitable
yes
there
is
a
girl
whom
i
can
t
do
without
he
said
lady
ashbridge
s
face
lit
up
ah
tell
me
about
her
tell
me
about
her
she
said
you
want
her
you
can
t
do
without
her
that
is
the
right
wife
for
michael
caught
at
his
mother
s
hand
as
it
stroked
his
sleeve
but
she
is
not
sure
that
she
can
do
with
me
he
said
her
face
was
not
dimmed
at
this
oh
you
may
be
sure
she
doesn
t
know
her
own
mind
she
said
girls
so
often
don
t
you
must
not
be
about
it
who
is
she
tell
me
about
she
s
the
sister
of
my
great
friend
hermann
falbe
he
said
who
teaches
me
this
time
the
gladness
faded
from
her
oh
my
dear
it
will
vex
your
father
again
she
said
that
you
should
want
to
marry
the
sister
of
a
it
will
never
do
to
vex
him
again
is
she
not
a
lady
michael
laughed
but
certainly
she
is
he
said
her
father
was
german
her
mother
was
a
tracy
just
as
as
you
or
how
odd
then
that
her
brother
should
have
taken
to
giving
music
lessons
that
does
not
sound
good
perhaps
they
are
poor
and
certainly
there
is
no
disgrace
in
being
poor
and
what
is
her
name
sylvia
said
michael
you
have
probably
heard
of
her
she
is
the
miss
falbe
who
made
such
a
sensation
in
london
last
season
by
her
the
old
outlook
the
old
traditions
were
beginning
to
come
to
the
surface
again
in
poor
lady
ashbridge
s
mind
oh
my
dear
she
said
a
singer
that
would
vex
your
father
terribly
fancy
the
daughter
of
a
miss
tracy
becoming
a
singer
and
yet
you
want
her
that
seems
to
me
to
matter
most
of
then
came
a
step
at
the
door
it
opened
an
inch
or
two
and
michael
heard
his
father
s
voice
is
your
mother
with
you
michael
he
asked
at
that
lady
ashbridge
got
up
for
one
second
she
clung
to
her
son
and
then
disengaging
herself
froze
up
like
the
sudden
congealment
of
a
spring
yes
robert
she
said
i
was
having
a
little
talk
to
may
i
come
in
it
s
our
secret
she
whispered
to
michael
yes
come
in
father
he
said
lord
ashbridge
stood
towering
in
the
doorway
come
my
dear
he
said
not
unkindly
it
s
time
for
you
to
go
to
she
had
become
the
mask
of
herself
again
yes
robert
she
said
i
suppose
it
must
be
late
i
will
come
oh
there
s
petsy
will
you
ring
michael
then
fedden
will
come
and
take
him
to
bed
he
sleeps
with
chapter
ix
michael
in
desperate
conversational
efforts
next
morning
at
breakfast
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
german
emperor
had
engaged
him
in
a
substantial
talk
at
munich
and
had
recommended
him
to
pass
the
winter
at
berlin
it
was
immediately
obvious
that
he
rose
in
his
father
s
estimation
for
though
no
doubt
primarily
the
fact
that
michael
was
his
son
was
the
cause
of
this
interest
it
gave
michael
a
sort
of
testimonial
also
to
his
respectability
if
the
emperor
had
thought
that
his
taking
up
a
musical
career
was
indelibly
disgraceful
as
lord
ashbridge
himself
had
done
he
would
certainly
not
have
made
himself
so
agreeable
on
anyone
of
lord
ashbridge
s
essential
and
snobbishness
this
could
not
fail
to
make
a
certain
effect
his
chilly
politeness
to
michael
sensibly
thawed
you
might
almost
have
detected
a
certain
cordiality
in
his
desire
to
learn
as
much
as
possible
of
this
gratifying
occurrence
and
you
mean
to
go
to
berlin
he
asked
i
m
afraid
i
shan
t
be
able
to
said
michael
my
master
is
in
i
should
be
inclined
to
reconsider
that
michael
said
the
father
the
emperor
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
on
the
subject
of
lady
ashbridge
looked
up
from
the
breakfast
she
was
giving
petsy
ii
his
dietary
was
rather
less
rich
than
that
of
the
defunct
and
she
was
afraid
sometimes
that
his
food
was
not
nourishing
enough
i
remember
the
concert
we
had
here
she
said
we
had
the
song
to
aegir
lord
ashbridge
gave
her
a
quick
glance
michael
felt
he
would
not
have
noticed
it
the
evening
before
your
memory
is
very
good
my
dear
he
said
with
encouragement
and
then
we
had
a
torchlight
procession
she
remarked
quite
so
you
remember
it
perfectly
and
about
his
visit
here
michael
did
he
talk
about
that
yes
very
warmly
also
about
our
international
lord
ashbridge
gave
a
little
giggle
i
must
tell
barbara
that
he
said
she
has
become
a
sort
of
cassandra
since
she
became
a
diplomatist
and
sits
on
her
tripod
and
prophesies
she
asked
me
about
it
said
michael
i
don
t
think
she
believes
in
his
he
giggled
again
that
s
because
i
didn
t
ask
her
down
for
his
visit
he
said
he
rose
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
my
dear
he
said
to
his
wife
she
looked
across
to
michael
perhaps
michael
will
come
for
a
stroll
with
me
she
said
no
doubt
he
will
i
shall
have
a
round
of
golf
i
think
on
this
fine
morning
i
should
like
to
have
a
word
with
you
michael
when
you
ve
finished
your
the
moment
he
had
gone
her
whole
manner
changed
it
was
suffused
with
the
glow
that
had
lit
her
last
night
and
we
shall
have
another
talk
dear
she
said
it
was
tiresome
being
interrupted
last
night
but
your
father
was
better
pleased
with
you
this
michael
s
understanding
of
the
situation
grew
clearer
whatever
was
the
change
in
his
mother
whatever
perhaps
it
portended
it
was
certainly
accompanied
by
two
symptoms
the
one
the
late
dawning
of
for
himself
the
other
a
certain
fear
of
her
husband
for
all
her
married
life
she
had
been
completely
dominated
by
him
and
had
lived
but
in
a
twilight
of
her
own
now
into
that
twilight
was
beginning
to
steal
a
dread
of
him
his
pleasure
or
his
vexation
had
begun
to
affect
her
emotionally
instead
of
being
as
before
merely
recorded
in
her
mind
as
she
might
have
recorded
an
object
quite
exterior
to
herself
and
seen
out
of
the
window
now
it
was
in
the
room
with
her
even
as
michael
left
her
to
speak
with
him
the
consciousness
of
him
rose
again
in
her
making
her
face
anxious
and
you
ll
try
not
to
vex
him
won
t
you
she
said
his
father
was
in
the
standing
enormously
in
front
of
the
fire
and
for
the
first
time
the
sense
of
his
colossal
fatuity
struck
michael
there
are
several
things
i
want
to
tell
you
about
he
said
your
career
first
of
all
i
take
it
that
you
have
no
intention
of
deferring
to
my
wishes
on
the
no
father
i
am
afraid
not
said
michael
i
want
you
to
understand
then
that
though
i
shall
not
speak
to
you
again
about
it
my
wishes
are
no
less
strong
than
they
were
it
is
something
to
me
to
know
that
a
man
whom
i
respect
so
much
as
the
emperor
doesn
t
feel
as
i
do
about
it
but
that
doesn
t
alter
my
i
understand
said
michael
the
next
is
about
your
mother
he
said
do
you
notice
any
change
in
her
yes
said
michael
can
you
describe
it
at
all
michael
hesitated
she
shows
quite
a
new
affection
for
myself
he
said
she
came
and
talked
to
me
last
night
in
a
way
she
had
never
done
the
irritation
which
michael
s
mere
presence
produced
on
his
father
was
beginning
to
make
itself
felt
the
fact
that
michael
was
squat
and
and
ugly
had
always
a
to
deal
at
lord
ashbridge
in
the
reminder
that
he
was
his
father
he
tried
to
disregard
this
he
tried
to
bring
his
mind
into
an
impartial
attitude
without
seeing
for
a
moment
the
bitter
irony
of
considering
impartiality
the
ideal
quality
when
dealing
with
his
son
he
tried
to
be
fair
and
michael
was
perfectly
conscious
of
the
effort
it
cost
him
i
had
noticed
something
of
the
sort
he
said
your
mother
was
always
asking
after
you
you
have
not
been
writing
very
regularly
michael
we
know
little
about
your
i
have
written
to
my
mother
every
week
said
michael
the
magical
effects
of
the
emperor
s
interest
were
dying
out
lord
ashbridge
became
more
keenly
aware
of
the
disappointment
that
michael
was
to
him
i
have
not
been
so
fortunate
then
he
said
michael
remembered
his
mother
s
anxious
face
but
he
could
not
let
this
pass
no
sir
he
said
but
you
never
answered
any
of
my
letters
i
thought
it
quite
probable
that
it
displeased
you
to
hear
from
i
should
have
expressed
my
displeasure
if
i
had
felt
it
said
his
father
with
all
the
pomposity
that
was
natural
to
him
that
had
not
occurred
to
me
said
michael
i
am
afraid
i
took
your
silence
to
mean
that
my
letters
didn
t
interest
he
paused
a
moment
and
his
rebellion
against
the
whole
of
his
father
s
attitude
flared
up
besides
i
had
nothing
particular
to
say
he
said
my
life
is
passed
in
the
pursuit
of
which
you
entirely
he
felt
himself
back
in
boyhood
again
with
this
stifling
and
leaden
atmosphere
of
authority
and
disapproval
to
breathe
he
knew
that
francis
in
his
place
would
have
done
somehow
differently
he
could
almost
hear
aunt
barbara
laughing
at
the
pomposity
of
the
situation
that
had
suddenly
erected
itself
monstrously
in
front
of
him
the
fact
that
he
was
michael
comber
vexed
his
father
there
was
no
statement
of
the
case
so
succinctly
true
lord
ashbridge
moved
away
towards
the
window
turning
his
back
on
michael
even
his
back
his
homespun
norfolk
jacket
his
loose
knickerbockers
his
stalwart
calves
expressed
disapproval
but
when
his
father
spoke
again
he
realised
that
he
had
moved
away
like
that
and
obscured
his
face
for
a
different
reason
have
you
noticed
anything
else
about
your
mother
he
asked
that
made
michael
understand
yes
father
he
said
i
daresay
i
am
wrong
about
it
naturally
i
may
not
agree
with
you
but
i
should
like
to
know
what
it
she
s
afraid
of
you
said
michael
lord
ashbridge
continued
looking
out
of
the
window
a
little
longer
letting
his
eyes
dwell
on
his
own
garden
and
his
own
fields
where
towered
the
leafless
elms
and
the
red
roofs
of
the
little
town
which
had
given
him
his
own
name
and
continued
to
give
him
so
satisfactory
an
income
there
presented
itself
to
his
mind
his
own
picture
painted
and
framed
and
glazed
and
hung
up
by
himself
the
beneficent
nobleman
the
conscientious
landlord
the
essential
vertebra
of
england
s
backbone
it
was
really
impossible
to
impute
blame
to
such
a
fine
fellow
he
turned
round
into
the
room
again
braced
and
refreshed
and
saw
michael
thus
it
is
quite
true
what
you
say
he
said
with
a
certain
pride
in
his
own
impartiality
she
has
developed
an
extraordinary
timidity
towards
me
i
have
continually
noticed
that
she
is
nervous
and
agitated
in
my
presence
i
am
quite
unable
to
account
for
it
in
fact
there
is
no
accounting
for
it
but
i
am
thinking
of
going
up
to
london
before
long
and
making
her
see
some
good
doctor
a
little
tonic
i
daresay
though
i
don
t
suppose
she
has
taken
a
dozen
doses
of
medicine
in
as
many
years
i
expect
she
will
be
glad
to
go
up
for
she
will
be
near
you
the
one
delusion
for
it
is
no
less
than
that
is
as
strange
as
the
he
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
magnificent
height
i
do
not
mean
that
it
is
not
very
natural
she
should
be
devoted
to
her
son
he
said
with
a
tremendous
air
what
he
did
mean
was
therefore
uncertain
and
again
he
changed
the
subject
there
is
a
third
thing
he
said
this
concerns
you
you
are
of
the
age
when
we
combers
usually
marry
i
should
wish
you
to
marry
michael
during
this
last
year
your
mother
has
asked
half
a
dozen
girls
down
here
all
of
whom
she
and
i
consider
perfectly
suitable
and
no
doubt
you
have
met
more
in
london
i
should
like
to
know
definitely
if
you
have
considered
the
question
and
if
you
have
not
i
ask
you
to
set
about
it
at
michael
was
suddenly
aware
that
never
for
a
moment
had
sylvia
been
away
from
his
mind
even
when
his
mother
was
talking
to
him
last
night
sylvia
had
sat
at
the
back
in
the
inmost
place
throned
and
secure
and
now
she
stepped
forward
apart
from
the
impossibility
of
not
acknowledging
her
he
wished
to
do
it
he
wanted
to
wear
her
publicly
though
she
was
not
his
he
wanted
to
take
his
allegiance
oath
though
his
sovereign
heeded
not
i
have
considered
the
question
he
said
and
i
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
whom
i
want
to
marry
she
is
miss
falbe
miss
sylvia
falbe
of
whom
you
may
have
heard
as
a
singer
she
is
the
sister
of
my
and
i
can
certainly
marry
nobody
it
was
not
merely
defiance
of
the
dreadful
old
tradition
which
lord
ashbridge
had
announced
in
the
manner
of
moses
stepping
down
from
sinai
that
prompted
this
appalling
statement
of
the
case
it
was
the
joy
in
the
profession
of
his
love
it
had
to
be
flung
out
like
that
lord
ashbridge
looked
at
him
a
moment
in
dead
silence
i
have
not
the
honour
of
knowing
miss
miss
falbe
is
it
he
said
nor
shall
i
have
that
michael
got
up
there
was
that
in
his
father
s
tone
that
stung
him
to
fury
it
is
very
likely
that
you
will
not
he
said
since
when
i
proposed
to
her
yesterday
she
did
not
accept
somehow
lord
ashbridge
felt
that
as
an
insult
to
himself
indeed
it
was
a
double
insult
michael
had
proposed
to
this
singer
and
this
singer
had
not
instantly
clutched
him
he
gave
his
dreadful
little
treble
giggle
and
i
am
to
bind
up
your
broken
heart
he
asked
michael
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
this
was
an
indiscretion
for
it
but
made
his
father
recognise
how
short
he
was
it
brought
farce
into
the
tragic
situation
oh
by
no
means
he
said
my
heart
is
not
going
to
break
yet
i
don
t
give
up
then
in
a
flash
he
thought
of
his
mother
s
pale
anxious
face
her
desire
that
he
should
not
vex
his
father
i
am
sorry
he
said
but
that
is
the
case
i
wish
i
wish
you
would
try
to
understand
i
find
you
incomprehensible
said
lord
ashbridge
and
left
the
room
with
his
high
walk
and
his
swinging
elbows
well
it
was
done
now
and
michael
felt
that
there
were
no
new
vexations
to
be
sprung
on
his
father
it
was
bound
to
happen
he
supposed
sooner
or
later
and
he
was
not
sorry
that
it
had
happened
sooner
than
he
expected
or
intended
sylvia
so
held
sway
in
him
that
he
could
not
help
acknowledging
her
his
announcement
had
broken
from
him
irresistibly
in
spite
of
his
mother
s
whispered
word
to
him
last
night
this
is
our
it
could
not
be
secret
when
his
father
spoke
like
that
and
then
with
a
flare
of
illumination
he
perceived
how
intensely
his
father
disliked
him
nothing
but
sheer
basic
antipathy
could
have
been
responsible
for
that
miserable
retort
am
i
to
bind
up
your
broken
heart
anger
no
doubt
was
the
immediate
cause
but
so
utterly
ungenerous
a
rejoinder
to
michael
s
announcement
could
not
have
been
conceived
except
in
a
heart
that
thoroughly
and
rootedly
disliked
him
that
he
was
a
continual
monument
of
disappointment
to
his
father
he
knew
well
but
never
before
had
it
been
quite
plainly
shown
him
how
essential
an
object
of
dislike
he
was
and
the
grounds
of
the
dislike
were
now
equally
plain
his
father
disliked
him
exactly
because
he
was
his
father
on
the
other
hand
the
last
hours
had
shown
him
that
his
mother
loved
him
exactly
because
he
was
her
son
when
these
two
new
and
undeniable
facts
were
put
side
by
side
michael
felt
that
he
was
an
infinite
gainer
he
went
rather
drearily
to
the
window
far
off
across
the
field
below
the
garden
he
could
see
lord
ashbridge
walking
airily
along
on
his
way
to
the
links
with
his
head
held
high
his
stick
swinging
in
his
hand
his
two
retrievers
at
his
heels
no
doubt
already
the
soothing
influences
of
nature
were
at
work
nature
of
course
standing
for
the
portion
of
trees
and
earth
and
houses
that
belonged
to
him
and
were
expunging
the
depressing
reflection
that
his
wife
and
only
son
inspired
in
him
and
indeed
such
was
actually
the
case
lord
ashbridge
in
his
amazing
fatuity
could
not
long
continue
being
himself
without
being
cheered
and
invigorated
by
that
fact
and
though
when
he
set
out
his
big
white
hands
were
positively
trembling
with
passion
he
carried
his
balsam
always
with
him
but
he
had
registered
to
himself
even
as
michael
had
registered
the
fact
that
he
found
his
son
a
most
intolerable
person
and
what
vexed
him
most
of
all
what
made
him
clang
the
gate
at
the
end
of
the
field
so
violently
that
it
hit
one
of
his
retrievers
shrewdly
on
the
nose
was
the
sense
of
his
own
impotence
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
in
point
of
view
of
determination
that
quality
which
in
himself
was
firmness
and
in
those
who
opposed
him
obstinacy
michael
was
his
match
and
the
annoying
thing
was
that
as
his
wife
had
once
told
him
michael
undoubtedly
inherited
that
quality
from
him
it
was
as
inalienable
as
the
estates
of
which
he
had
threatened
to
deprive
his
son
and
which
as
he
knew
quite
well
were
absolutely
entailed
michael
in
this
regard
seemed
no
better
than
a
common
but
successful
thief
he
had
annexed
his
father
s
firmness
and
at
his
death
would
certainly
annex
all
his
pictures
and
trees
and
acres
and
the
red
roofs
of
ashbridge
michael
saw
the
gate
so
imperially
slammed
he
heard
the
despairing
howl
of
robin
and
though
he
was
sorry
for
robin
he
could
not
help
laughing
he
remembered
also
a
ludicrous
sight
he
had
seen
at
the
zoological
gardens
a
few
days
ago
two
seals
sitting
bolt
upright
quarrelling
with
each
other
and
making
the
most
absurd
grimaces
and
noises
they
neither
of
them
quite
dared
to
attack
the
other
and
so
sat
with
their
faces
close
together
saying
the
rudest
things
aunt
barbara
would
certainly
have
seen
how
inimitably
his
father
and
he
had
in
their
interview
just
now
resembled
the
two
seals
and
then
he
became
aware
that
all
the
time
au
fond
he
had
thought
about
nothing
but
sylvia
and
of
sylvia
not
as
the
subject
of
quarrel
but
as
just
sylvia
the
singing
sylvia
with
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
the
winter
sun
was
warm
on
the
south
terrace
of
the
house
when
an
hour
later
he
strolled
out
according
to
arrangement
with
his
mother
it
had
melted
the
rime
of
the
night
before
that
lay
now
on
the
grass
in
threads
of
minute
diamonds
though
below
the
terrace
wall
and
on
the
sunk
rims
of
the
empty
garden
beds
it
still
persisted
in
outline
of
white
heraldry
a
few
monthly
roses
weak
pink
blossoms
weary
with
the
toil
of
keeping
hope
alive
till
the
coming
of
spring
hung
dejected
heads
in
the
sunk
garden
where
the
hornbeam
hedge
that
carried
its
russet
leaves
unfallen
shaded
them
from
the
wind
here
too
a
few
bulbs
had
pricked
their
way
above
ground
and
stood
with
stout
erect
horns
daintily
capped
with
rime
all
these
things
which
for
years
had
been
presented
to
lady
ashbridge
s
notice
without
attracting
her
attention
now
filled
her
with
minute
childlike
pleasure
they
were
discoveries
as
entrancing
and
as
magical
as
the
first
finding
of
the
oval
pieces
of
blue
sky
that
a
child
sees
one
morning
in
a
s
nest
now
that
she
was
alone
with
her
son
all
her
secret
restlessness
and
anxiety
had
vanished
and
she
remarked
almost
with
glee
that
her
husband
had
telephoned
from
the
golf
links
to
say
that
he
would
not
be
back
for
lunch
then
remembering
that
michael
had
gone
to
talk
to
his
father
after
breakfast
she
asked
him
about
the
interview
michael
had
already
made
up
his
mind
as
to
what
to
say
here
knowing
that
his
father
was
anxious
about
her
he
felt
it
highly
unlikely
that
he
would
tell
her
anything
to
distress
her
and
so
he
represented
the
interview
as
having
gone
off
in
perfect
amity
later
in
the
day
on
his
father
s
return
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
propose
a
truce
between
them
as
far
as
his
mother
was
concerned
whether
that
would
be
accepted
or
not
he
could
not
certainly
tell
but
in
the
interval
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
grieving
her
a
great
weight
was
lifted
off
her
mind
ah
my
dear
that
is
good
she
said
i
was
anxious
so
now
perhaps
we
shall
have
a
peaceful
christmas
i
am
glad
your
aunt
barbara
and
francis
are
coming
for
though
your
aunt
always
laughs
at
your
father
she
does
it
kindly
does
she
not
and
as
for
francis
my
dear
if
god
had
given
me
two
sons
i
should
have
liked
the
other
to
be
like
francis
and
shall
we
walk
a
little
farther
this
way
and
see
poor
petsy
s
grave
petsy
s
grave
proved
rather
agitating
there
were
doleful
little
stories
of
the
last
days
to
be
related
and
petsy
ii
was
tiresome
and
insisted
on
defying
the
world
generally
with
shrill
barkings
from
the
top
of
the
small
mound
conscious
perhaps
that
his
helpless
predecessor
slept
below
then
their
walk
brought
them
to
the
band
of
trees
that
separated
the
links
from
the
house
from
which
lady
ashbridge
retreated
fearful
as
she
vaguely
phrased
it
of
being
seen
and
by
whom
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
explain
then
across
the
field
came
a
group
of
children
scampering
home
from
school
they
ceased
their
shouting
and
their
games
as
the
others
came
near
and
demurely
curtsied
and
took
off
their
caps
to
lady
ashbridge
nice
children
said
she
a
merry
christmas
to
you
all
i
hope
you
are
all
good
children
to
your
mothers
as
my
son
is
to
she
pressed
his
arm
nodded
and
smiled
at
the
children
and
walked
on
with
him
and
michael
felt
the
lump
in
his
throat
the
arrival
of
aunt
barbara
and
francis
that
afternoon
did
something
by
the
mere
addition
of
numbers
to
the
party
to
relieve
the
tension
of
the
situation
lord
ashbridge
said
little
but
ate
largely
and
during
the
intervals
of
empty
plates
directed
an
impartial
gaze
at
the
portraits
of
his
ancestors
while
wholly
ignoring
his
descendant
but
michael
was
too
wise
to
put
himself
into
places
where
he
could
be
pointedly
ignored
and
the
resplendent
dinner
with
its
six
footmen
and
its
silver
service
was
not
really
more
joyless
than
usual
but
his
father
s
majestic
displeasure
was
more
apparent
when
the
three
men
sat
alone
afterwards
and
it
was
in
dead
silence
that
port
was
pushed
round
and
cigarettes
handed
francis
it
is
true
made
a
couple
of
efforts
to
enliven
things
but
his
remarks
produced
no
response
whatever
from
his
uncle
and
he
subsided
into
himself
thinking
with
regret
of
what
an
amusing
evening
he
would
have
had
if
he
had
only
stopped
in
town
but
when
they
rose
michael
signed
to
his
cousin
to
go
on
and
planted
himself
firmly
in
the
path
to
the
door
it
was
evident
that
his
father
did
not
mean
to
speak
to
him
but
he
could
not
push
by
him
or
walk
over
him
there
is
one
thing
i
want
to
say
to
you
father
said
he
i
have
told
my
mother
that
our
interview
this
morning
was
quite
amicable
i
do
not
see
why
she
should
be
distressed
by
knowing
that
it
was
his
father
s
face
softened
a
moment
yes
i
agree
to
that
he
said
as
far
as
that
went
the
compact
was
observed
and
whenever
lady
ashbridge
was
present
her
husband
made
a
point
of
addressing
a
few
remarks
to
michael
but
there
their
intercourse
ended
michael
found
opportunity
to
explain
to
aunt
barbara
what
had
happened
suggesting
as
a
consolatory
simile
the
domestic
difficulties
of
the
seals
at
the
zoological
gardens
and
was
pleased
to
find
her
recognise
the
aptness
of
this
description
but
heaviest
of
all
on
the
spirits
of
the
whole
party
sat
the
anxiety
about
lady
ashbridge
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
some
cerebral
degeneration
was
occurring
and
lady
barbara
s
urgent
representation
to
her
brother
had
the
effect
of
making
him
promise
to
take
her
up
to
london
without
delay
after
christmas
and
let
a
specialist
see
her
for
the
present
the
pious
fraud
practised
on
her
that
michael
and
his
father
had
had
a
good
talk
together
and
were
excellent
friends
sufficed
to
render
her
happy
and
cheerful
she
had
long
dim
talks
full
of
repetition
with
michael
whose
presence
appeared
to
make
her
completely
content
and
when
he
was
out
or
away
from
her
she
would
sit
eagerly
waiting
for
his
return
petsy
to
the
great
benefit
of
his
health
got
somewhat
neglected
by
her
her
whole
nature
and
instincts
were
alight
with
the
that
had
burnt
so
late
into
flame
with
this
tragic
accompaniment
of
derangement
she
seemed
to
be
groping
her
way
back
to
the
days
when
michael
was
a
little
boy
and
she
was
a
young
woman
often
she
would
seat
herself
at
her
piano
if
michael
was
not
there
to
play
to
her
and
in
a
thin
quavering
voice
sing
the
songs
of
twenty
years
ago
she
would
listen
to
his
playing
beating
time
to
his
music
and
most
of
all
she
loved
the
hour
when
the
day
was
drawing
in
and
the
first
shadow
and
flame
of
dusk
and
firelight
then
with
her
hand
in
his
sitting
in
her
room
where
they
would
not
be
interrupted
she
would
whisper
fresh
inquiries
about
sylvia
offering
to
go
herself
to
the
girl
and
tell
her
how
lovable
her
suitor
was
she
lived
in
a
dim
subaqueous
sort
of
consciousness
physically
quite
well
and
mentally
serene
in
the
knowledge
that
michael
was
in
the
house
and
would
presently
come
and
talk
to
her
for
the
others
it
was
dismal
enough
this
shadow
that
was
to
her
a
watery
sunlight
lay
over
them
all
this
and
the
further
quarrel
unknown
to
her
between
michael
and
his
father
when
they
all
met
as
at
meal
times
there
was
the
miserable
pretence
of
friendliness
and
comfortable
ease
kept
up
for
fear
of
distressing
lady
ashbridge
it
was
dreary
work
for
all
concerned
but
luckily
not
difficult
of
accomplishment
a
little
chatter
about
the
weather
the
merest
small
change
of
conversation
especially
if
that
conversation
was
held
between
michael
and
his
father
was
sufficient
to
wreathe
her
in
smiles
and
she
would
according
to
habit
break
in
with
some
wrecking
remark
that
entailed
starting
this
talk
all
afresh
but
when
she
left
the
room
a
glowering
silence
would
fall
lord
ashbridge
would
pick
up
a
book
or
leave
the
room
with
his
walk
and
erect
head
the
picture
of
insulted
dignity
of
the
three
he
was
far
most
to
be
pitied
although
the
situation
was
the
direct
result
of
his
own
arrogance
and
but
arrogance
and
were
as
essential
ingredients
of
his
character
as
was
humour
of
aunt
barbara
s
they
were
very
awkward
and
tiresome
qualities
but
this
particular
lord
ashbridge
would
have
no
existence
without
them
he
was
deeply
and
mortally
offended
with
michael
that
alone
was
sufficient
to
make
a
sultry
and
stifling
atmosphere
and
in
addition
to
that
he
had
the
burden
of
his
anxiety
about
his
wife
here
came
an
extra
sting
for
in
common
humanity
he
had
by
appearing
to
be
friends
with
michael
to
secure
her
serenity
and
this
could
only
be
done
by
the
continued
profanation
of
his
own
highly
proper
and
necessary
attitude
towards
his
son
he
had
to
address
friendly
words
to
michael
that
really
almost
choked
him
he
had
to
practise
cordiality
with
this
wretch
who
wanted
to
marry
the
sister
of
a
michael
had
pulled
up
all
the
old
traditions
that
and
pompous
as
if
they
had
been
weeds
and
thrown
them
in
his
father
s
face
it
was
indeed
no
wonder
that
in
his
wife
s
absence
he
almost
burst
with
indignation
over
the
desecrated
beds
more
than
that
his
own
was
hurt
by
his
wife
s
fear
of
him
just
as
if
he
had
been
a
hard
and
unkind
husband
to
her
which
he
had
not
been
but
merely
a
very
and
dominant
one
while
the
one
person
who
could
make
her
quite
happy
was
his
despised
son
michael
s
person
michael
s
tastes
michael
s
whole
presence
and
character
were
repugnant
to
him
and
yet
michael
had
the
power
which
to
do
lord
ashbridge
justice
he
would
have
given
much
to
be
possessed
of
himself
of
bringing
comfort
and
serenity
to
his
wife
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
following
christmas
the
two
cousins
had
been
across
the
estuary
to
ashbridge
together
francis
who
in
spite
of
his
habitual
easiness
of
disposition
and
general
good
temper
had
found
the
conditions
of
anger
and
anxiety
quite
intolerable
had
settled
to
leave
next
day
instead
of
stopping
till
the
end
of
the
week
and
michael
acquiesced
in
this
without
any
sense
of
desertion
he
had
really
only
wondered
why
francis
had
stopped
three
nights
instead
of
finding
urgent
private
business
in
town
after
one
he
realised
also
somewhat
with
surprise
that
francis
was
no
good
when
there
was
trouble
about
there
was
no
one
so
delightful
when
there
was
so
to
speak
a
contest
of
who
should
enjoy
himself
the
most
and
francis
invariably
won
but
if
the
subject
of
the
contest
was
changed
and
the
prize
given
for
the
individual
who
under
depressing
circumstances
should
contrive
to
show
the
greatest
serenity
of
aspect
francis
would
have
lost
with
an
even
greater
margin
michael
in
fact
was
rather
relieved
than
otherwise
at
his
cousin
s
immediate
departure
for
it
helped
nobody
to
see
the
martyred
sebastian
and
it
was
merely
odious
for
sebastian
himself
in
fact
at
this
moment
when
michael
was
rowing
them
back
across
the
estuary
francis
was
explaining
this
with
his
customary
lucidity
i
don
t
do
any
good
here
mike
he
said
uncle
robert
doesn
t
speak
to
me
any
more
than
he
does
to
you
except
when
aunt
marion
is
there
and
there
s
nothing
going
on
is
there
i
practically
asked
if
i
might
go
and
uncle
robert
merely
looked
out
of
the
window
but
if
anybody
specially
you
wanted
me
to
stop
why
of
course
i
but
i
don
t
said
michael
thanks
awfully
gosh
look
at
those
ducks
they
re
just
wanting
to
be
shot
but
there
it
is
then
certainly
uncle
robert
doesn
t
want
me
nor
aunt
marion
i
say
what
do
they
think
is
the
matter
with
her
michael
looked
round
then
took
rather
too
late
another
pull
on
his
oars
and
the
boat
gently
grated
on
the
pebbly
mud
at
the
side
of
the
francis
s
question
the
insouciance
of
it
grated
on
his
mind
in
rather
similar
fashion
we
don
t
know
yet
he
said
i
expect
we
shall
all
go
back
to
town
in
a
couple
of
days
so
that
she
may
see
francis
jumped
out
briskly
and
gracefully
and
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
while
michael
pushed
off
again
and
brought
the
boat
into
its
shed
i
do
hope
it
s
nothing
serious
he
said
she
looks
quite
well
doesn
t
she
i
daresay
it
s
nothing
but
she
s
been
alone
hasn
t
she
with
uncle
robert
all
these
weeks
that
would
give
her
the
hump
michael
felt
a
sudden
spasm
of
impatience
at
these
elegant
and
consoling
reflections
but
now
in
the
light
of
his
own
increasing
maturity
he
saw
how
hopeless
it
was
to
feel
francis
s
deficiencies
his
entire
lack
of
deep
feeling
he
was
made
like
that
and
if
you
were
fond
of
anybody
the
only
possible
way
of
living
up
to
your
affection
was
to
attach
yourself
to
their
qualities
they
strolled
a
little
way
in
silence
and
why
did
you
tell
uncle
robert
about
sylvia
falbe
asked
francis
i
can
t
understand
that
for
the
present
anyhow
she
had
refused
you
there
was
nothing
to
tell
him
about
if
i
was
fond
of
a
girl
like
that
i
should
say
nothing
about
it
if
i
knew
my
people
would
disapprove
until
i
had
got
michael
laughed
oh
yes
you
would
he
said
if
you
were
to
use
your
own
words
fond
of
her
like
you
couldn
t
help
it
at
least
i
couldn
t
it
s
it
s
such
a
glory
to
be
fond
like
he
stopped
we
won
t
talk
about
it
he
said
or
rather
i
can
t
talk
about
it
if
you
don
t
but
she
had
refused
you
said
the
sensible
francis
that
makes
no
difference
she
shines
through
everything
through
the
infernal
awfulness
of
these
days
through
my
father
s
anger
and
my
mother
s
illness
whatever
it
proves
to
be
i
think
about
them
really
with
all
my
might
and
at
the
end
i
find
i
ve
been
thinking
about
sylvia
everything
is
she
the
woods
the
tide
oh
i
can
t
they
had
walked
across
the
marshy
land
at
the
edge
of
the
estuary
and
now
in
front
of
them
was
the
steep
and
direct
path
up
to
the
house
and
the
longer
way
through
the
woods
at
this
point
the
estuary
made
a
sudden
turn
to
the
left
sweeping
directly
seawards
and
round
the
corner
immediately
in
front
of
them
was
the
long
reach
of
deep
water
up
which
even
when
the
tide
was
at
its
lowest
an
steamer
could
penetrate
if
it
knew
the
windings
of
the
channel
in
the
windless
cold
calm
of
though
the
sun
was
brilliant
in
a
blue
sky
overhead
an
opaque
mist
thick
as
lay
over
the
surface
of
the
water
and
taking
the
winding
road
through
the
woods
which
following
the
estuary
turned
the
point
they
presently
found
themselves
as
they
mounted
quite
clear
of
the
mist
that
lay
below
them
on
the
river
their
steps
were
noiseless
on
the
mossy
path
and
almost
immediately
after
they
had
turned
the
corner
as
francis
paused
to
light
a
cigarette
they
heard
from
just
below
them
the
creaking
of
oars
in
their
rowlocks
it
caught
the
ears
of
them
both
and
without
conscious
curiosity
they
listened
on
the
moment
the
sound
of
rowing
ceased
and
from
the
dense
mist
just
below
them
there
came
a
sound
which
was
quite
unmistakable
namely
the
plop
of
something
heavy
dropped
into
the
water
that
sound
by
some
remote
form
of
association
suddenly
recalled
to
michael
s
mind
certain
questions
aunt
barbara
had
asked
him
about
the
emperor
s
stay
at
ashbridge
and
his
own
recollection
of
his
having
gone
up
and
down
the
river
in
a
launch
there
was
something
further
which
he
did
not
immediately
recollect
yes
it
was
the
request
that
if
when
he
was
here
at
christmas
he
found
strangers
hanging
about
the
reach
of
which
the
chart
was
known
only
to
the
admiralty
he
should
let
her
know
here
at
this
moment
they
were
overlooking
the
water
and
here
at
this
moment
unseen
was
a
boat
rowing
stealthily
stopping
and
perhaps
making
soundings
he
laid
his
hand
on
francis
s
arm
with
a
gesture
for
silence
then
invisible
below
someone
said
fifteen
fathoms
and
again
the
oars
creaked
audibly
in
the
rowlocks
michael
took
a
step
towards
his
cousin
so
that
he
could
whisper
to
him
come
back
to
the
boat
he
said
i
want
to
row
round
and
see
who
that
is
wait
a
moment
the
oars
below
made
some
strokes
and
then
were
still
again
once
more
there
came
the
sound
of
something
heavy
dropped
into
the
water
someone
is
making
soundings
in
the
channel
there
he
said
they
went
very
quietly
till
they
were
round
the
point
then
quickened
their
steps
and
michael
spoke
that
s
the
uncharted
channel
he
said
at
least
only
the
admiralty
have
the
soundings
the
water
s
deep
enough
right
across
for
a
ship
of
moderate
draught
to
come
up
but
there
is
a
channel
up
which
any
can
pass
of
course
it
may
be
an
admiralty
boat
making
fresh
soundings
but
not
likely
on
boxing
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
francis
striding
easily
along
by
michael
s
short
steps
just
see
if
we
can
find
out
who
it
is
aunt
barbara
asked
me
about
it
i
ll
tell
you
afterwards
now
the
tide
s
going
out
we
can
drop
down
with
it
and
we
shan
t
be
heard
i
ll
row
just
enough
to
keep
her
head
straight
sit
in
the
bow
francis
and
keep
a
sharp
foot
by
foot
they
dropped
down
the
river
and
soon
came
into
the
thick
mist
that
lay
beyond
the
point
it
was
impossible
to
see
more
than
a
yard
or
two
ahead
but
the
same
dense
obscurity
would
prevent
any
further
range
of
vision
from
the
other
boat
and
if
it
was
still
at
its
work
the
sound
of
its
oars
or
of
voices
michael
reflected
might
guide
him
to
it
from
the
lisp
of
little
wavelets
lapping
on
the
shore
below
the
woods
he
knew
he
was
quite
close
in
to
the
bank
and
close
also
to
the
place
where
the
invisible
boat
had
been
ten
minutes
before
then
in
the
bewildering
unlocalised
manner
in
which
sound
without
the
corrective
guidance
of
sight
comes
to
the
ears
he
heard
as
before
the
creaking
of
invisible
oars
somewhere
quite
close
at
hand
next
moment
the
dark
prow
of
a
suddenly
loomed
into
sight
on
their
starboard
and
he
took
a
rapid
stroke
with
his
scull
to
bring
them
up
to
it
but
at
the
same
moment
while
yet
the
occupants
of
the
other
boat
were
but
shadows
in
the
mist
they
saw
him
and
a
quick
word
of
command
rang
out
row
row
hard
it
cried
and
with
a
frenzied
churning
of
oars
in
the
water
the
other
boat
shot
by
them
making
down
the
estuary
next
moment
it
had
quite
vanished
in
the
mist
leaving
behind
it
knots
of
swirling
water
from
its
michael
started
in
vain
pursuit
his
craft
was
heavy
and
clumsy
and
from
the
retreating
and
sound
of
the
other
it
was
clear
that
he
could
get
no
pace
to
match
still
less
to
overtake
them
soon
he
pantingly
desisted
but
an
admiralty
boat
wouldn
t
have
run
away
he
said
they
d
have
asked
us
who
the
devil
we
but
who
else
was
it
asked
francis
michael
mopped
his
forehead
aunt
barbara
would
tell
you
he
said
she
would
tell
you
that
they
were
german
francis
laughed
or
timbuctoo
niggers
he
remarked
and
that
would
be
an
odd
thing
too
said
michael
but
at
that
moment
he
felt
the
first
chill
of
the
shadow
that
menaced
if
by
chance
aunt
barbara
was
right
and
if
already
the
clear
tranquillity
of
the
sky
was
growing
dim
as
with
the
mist
that
lay
that
afternoon
on
the
waters
of
the
deep
reach
and
covered
mysterious
movements
which
were
going
on
below
it
england
and
germany
there
was
so
much
of
his
life
and
his
heart
there
music
and
song
and
sylvia
chapter
x
michael
had
heard
the
verdict
of
the
brain
specialist
who
yesterday
had
seen
his
mother
and
was
sitting
in
his
room
beside
his
unopened
piano
quietly
assimilating
it
and
without
making
plans
of
his
own
initiative
contemplating
the
forms
into
which
the
future
was
beginning
to
fall
mapping
itself
out
below
him
outlining
itself
as
when
objects
in
a
room
as
the
light
of
morning
steals
in
take
shape
again
and
even
as
they
take
the
familiar
shapes
so
already
he
felt
that
he
had
guessed
all
this
in
that
week
down
at
ashbridge
from
which
he
had
returned
with
his
father
and
mother
a
couple
of
days
before
she
was
suffering
without
doubt
from
some
softening
of
the
brain
nothing
of
remedial
nature
could
possibly
be
done
to
arrest
or
cure
the
progress
of
the
disease
and
all
that
lay
in
human
power
was
to
secure
for
her
as
much
content
and
serenity
as
possible
in
her
present
condition
there
was
no
question
of
putting
her
under
restraint
nor
indeed
could
she
be
certified
by
any
doctor
as
insane
she
would
have
to
have
a
trained
attendant
she
would
live
a
secluded
life
from
which
must
be
kept
as
far
as
possible
anything
that
could
agitate
or
distress
her
and
after
that
there
was
nothing
more
that
could
be
done
except
to
wait
for
the
inevitable
development
of
her
malady
this
might
come
quickly
or
slowly
there
was
no
means
of
forecasting
that
though
the
rapid
deterioration
of
her
brain
which
had
taken
place
during
those
last
two
months
made
it
on
the
whole
likely
that
the
progress
of
the
disease
would
be
swift
it
was
quite
possible
on
the
other
hand
that
it
might
remain
stationary
for
months
and
in
answer
to
a
question
of
michael
s
sir
james
had
looked
at
him
a
moment
in
silence
then
he
answered
both
for
her
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
all
of
you
he
had
said
one
hopes
that
it
will
be
lord
ashbridge
had
just
telephoned
that
he
was
coming
round
to
see
michael
a
message
that
considerably
astonished
him
since
it
would
have
been
more
in
his
manner
in
the
unlikely
event
of
his
wishing
to
see
his
son
to
have
summoned
him
to
the
house
in
curzon
street
however
he
had
announced
his
advent
and
thus
waiting
for
him
and
not
much
concerning
himself
about
that
michael
let
the
future
map
itself
already
it
was
sharply
defined
its
boundaries
and
limits
were
clear
and
though
it
was
yet
untravelled
it
presented
to
him
a
familiar
aspect
and
he
felt
that
he
could
find
his
allotted
road
without
fail
though
he
had
never
yet
traversed
it
it
was
strongly
marked
there
could
be
no
difficulty
or
question
about
it
indeed
a
week
ago
when
first
the
recognition
of
his
mother
s
condition
with
the
symptoms
attached
to
it
was
known
to
him
he
had
seen
the
signpost
that
directed
him
into
the
future
lord
ashbridge
made
his
usual
flamboyant
entry
prancing
and
swinging
his
elbows
whatever
happened
he
would
still
be
lord
ashbridge
with
his
grey
and
his
large
carnation
and
his
enviable
position
you
will
have
heard
what
sir
james
s
opinion
is
about
your
poor
mother
he
said
it
was
in
consequence
of
what
he
recommended
when
he
talked
over
the
future
with
me
that
i
came
to
see
michael
guessed
very
well
what
this
recommendation
was
but
with
a
certain
stubbornness
and
sense
of
what
was
due
to
himself
he
let
his
father
proceed
with
the
not
very
welcome
task
of
telling
him
in
fact
michael
he
said
i
have
a
favour
to
ask
of
the
fact
of
his
being
lord
ashbridge
and
the
fact
of
michael
being
his
unsatisfactory
son
stiffened
him
and
he
had
to
qualify
the
favour
perhaps
i
should
not
say
i
am
about
to
ask
you
a
favour
he
corrected
himself
but
rather
to
point
out
to
you
what
is
your
obvious
suddenly
it
struck
michael
that
his
father
was
not
thinking
about
lady
ashbridge
at
all
nor
about
him
but
in
the
main
about
himself
all
had
to
be
done
from
the
dominant
standpoint
he
owed
it
to
himself
to
alleviate
the
conditions
under
which
his
wife
must
live
he
owed
it
to
himself
that
his
son
should
do
his
part
as
a
comber
there
was
no
longer
any
possible
doubt
as
to
what
this
favour
or
this
direction
of
duty
must
be
but
still
michael
chose
that
his
father
should
state
it
he
pushed
a
chair
forward
for
him
won
t
you
sit
down
he
said
thank
you
i
would
rather
stand
yes
it
is
not
so
much
a
favour
as
the
indication
of
your
duty
i
do
not
know
if
you
will
see
it
in
the
same
light
as
i
you
have
shown
me
before
now
that
we
do
not
take
the
same
michael
felt
himself
bristling
his
father
certainly
had
the
effect
of
drawing
out
in
him
all
the
feelings
that
were
better
suppressed
i
think
we
need
not
talk
of
that
now
sir
he
remarked
certainly
it
is
not
the
subject
of
my
interview
with
you
now
the
fact
is
this
in
some
way
your
presence
gives
a
certain
serenity
and
content
to
your
mother
i
noticed
that
at
ashbridge
and
indeed
there
has
been
some
trouble
with
her
this
morning
because
i
could
not
take
her
to
come
to
see
you
with
me
i
ask
you
therefore
for
her
sake
to
be
with
us
as
much
as
you
can
in
short
to
come
and
live
with
michael
nodded
saluting
so
to
speak
the
signpost
into
the
future
as
he
passed
it
i
had
already
determined
to
do
that
he
said
i
had
determined
at
any
rate
to
ask
your
permission
to
do
so
it
is
clear
that
my
mother
wants
me
and
no
other
consideration
can
weigh
with
lord
ashbridge
still
remained
completely
i
am
glad
you
take
that
view
of
it
he
said
i
think
that
is
all
i
have
to
now
michael
was
an
adept
at
giving
as
indicated
before
when
he
gave
he
gave
nobly
and
he
could
not
only
outwardly
disregard
but
he
inwardly
cancelled
the
wonderful
ungenerosity
with
which
his
father
received
that
did
not
concern
him
i
will
make
arrangements
to
come
at
once
he
said
if
you
can
receive
me
that
will
hardly
be
worth
while
will
it
i
am
taking
your
mother
back
to
ashbridge
michael
got
up
in
silence
after
all
this
gift
of
himself
of
his
time
of
his
liberty
of
all
that
constituted
life
to
him
was
made
not
to
his
father
but
to
his
mother
it
was
made
as
his
heart
knew
not
ungrudgingly
only
but
eagerly
and
if
it
had
been
recommended
by
the
doctor
that
she
should
go
to
ashbridge
he
would
have
entirely
disregarded
the
large
additional
sacrifice
on
himself
which
it
entailed
thus
it
was
not
owing
to
any
retraction
of
his
gift
or
reconsideration
of
it
that
he
demurred
i
hope
you
will
will
meet
me
about
this
sir
he
said
you
must
remember
that
all
my
work
lies
in
london
i
want
naturally
to
continue
that
as
far
as
i
can
if
you
go
to
ashbridge
it
is
completely
interrupted
my
friends
are
here
too
everything
i
have
is
his
father
seemed
to
swell
a
little
he
appeared
to
fill
the
room
and
all
my
duties
lie
at
ashbridge
he
said
as
you
know
i
am
not
of
the
type
of
absentee
landlords
it
is
quite
impossible
that
i
should
spend
these
months
in
idleness
in
town
i
have
never
done
such
a
thing
yet
nor
i
may
say
would
our
class
hold
the
position
they
do
if
we
did
we
shall
come
up
to
town
after
easter
should
your
mother
s
health
permit
it
but
till
then
i
could
not
dream
of
neglecting
my
duties
in
the
now
michael
knew
perfectly
well
what
his
father
s
duties
on
that
excellently
managed
estate
were
they
consisted
of
a
interview
in
the
an
abode
of
files
and
stags
heads
in
which
lord
ashbridge
received
various
reports
of
building
schemes
and
repairs
of
a
round
of
golf
every
afternoon
and
of
reading
the
lessons
and
handing
the
on
sunday
that
at
least
was
the
as
it
presented
itself
to
him
and
on
which
he
framed
his
conclusions
but
he
left
out
altogether
the
moral
effect
of
the
big
landlord
living
on
his
own
land
and
being
surrounded
by
his
own
dependents
which
his
father
on
the
other
hand
so
vastly
it
was
clear
that
there
was
not
likely
to
be
much
accord
between
them
on
this
subject
but
could
you
not
go
down
there
perhaps
once
or
twice
a
week
and
get
bailey
to
come
and
consult
you
here
he
asked
lord
ashbridge
held
his
head
very
high
that
would
be
completely
out
of
the
question
he
said
all
this
michael
felt
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
problem
of
his
mother
and
himself
it
was
outside
it
altogether
and
concerned
only
his
father
s
convenience
he
was
willing
to
press
this
point
as
far
as
possible
i
had
imagined
you
would
stop
in
london
he
said
supposing
under
these
circumstances
i
refuse
to
live
with
you
i
should
draw
my
own
conclusion
as
to
the
sincerity
of
your
profession
of
duty
towards
your
and
practically
what
would
you
do
asked
michael
your
mother
and
i
would
go
to
ashbridge
tomorrow
all
the
another
alternative
suddenly
suggested
itself
to
michael
which
he
was
almost
ashamed
of
proposing
for
it
implied
that
his
father
put
his
own
convenience
as
outweighing
any
other
consideration
but
he
saw
that
if
only
lord
ashbridge
was
selfish
enough
to
consent
to
it
it
had
manifest
merits
his
mother
would
be
alone
with
him
free
of
the
presence
that
so
disconcerted
her
i
propose
then
he
said
that
she
and
i
should
remain
in
town
as
you
want
to
be
at
he
had
been
almost
ashamed
of
suggesting
it
but
no
such
shame
was
reflected
in
his
father
s
mind
this
would
relieve
him
of
the
perpetual
embarrassment
of
his
wife
s
presence
and
the
perpetual
irritation
of
michael
s
he
had
persuaded
himself
that
he
was
making
a
tremendous
personal
sacrifice
in
proposing
that
michael
should
live
with
them
and
this
relieved
him
of
the
necessity
upon
my
word
michael
he
said
with
the
first
hint
of
cordiality
that
he
had
displayed
that
is
very
well
thought
of
let
us
consider
it
is
certainly
the
case
that
this
derangement
in
your
poor
mother
s
mind
has
caused
her
to
take
what
i
might
almost
call
a
dislike
to
me
i
mentioned
that
to
sir
james
though
it
was
very
painful
for
me
to
do
so
and
he
said
that
it
was
a
common
and
most
distressing
symptom
of
brain
disease
that
the
sufferer
often
turned
against
those
he
loved
best
your
plan
would
have
the
effect
of
removing
he
paused
a
moment
and
became
even
more
sublimely
fatuous
you
too
he
said
it
would
obviate
the
interruption
of
your
work
about
which
you
feel
so
keenly
you
would
be
able
to
go
on
with
it
of
myself
i
don
t
think
at
all
i
shall
be
lonely
no
doubt
at
ashbridge
but
my
own
personal
feelings
must
not
be
taken
into
account
yes
it
seems
to
me
a
very
sensible
notion
we
shall
have
to
see
what
your
mother
says
to
it
she
might
not
like
me
to
be
away
from
her
in
spite
of
her
apparent
er
dislike
of
me
it
must
all
depend
on
her
attitude
but
for
my
part
i
think
very
well
of
your
scheme
thank
you
michael
for
suggesting
he
left
immediately
after
this
to
ascertain
lady
ashbridge
s
feelings
about
it
and
walked
home
with
a
complete
resumption
of
his
usual
exuberance
it
indeed
seemed
an
admirable
plan
it
relieved
him
from
the
nightmare
of
his
wife
s
continual
presence
and
this
he
expressed
to
himself
by
thinking
that
it
relieved
her
from
his
it
was
not
that
he
was
deficient
in
sympathy
for
her
for
in
his
way
he
was
fond
of
her
but
he
could
sympathise
with
her
just
as
well
at
ashbridge
he
could
do
no
good
to
her
and
he
had
not
for
her
that
instinct
of
love
which
would
make
it
impossible
for
him
to
leave
her
he
would
also
be
spared
the
constant
irritation
of
having
michael
in
the
house
and
this
he
expressed
to
himself
by
saying
that
michael
disliked
him
and
would
be
far
more
at
his
ease
without
him
furthermore
michael
would
be
able
to
continue
his
studies
of
this
too
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
had
always
done
his
best
to
discourage
them
he
made
a
translation
by
telling
himself
that
he
was
very
glad
not
to
have
to
cause
michael
to
discontinue
them
in
fine
he
persuaded
himself
without
any
difficulty
that
he
was
a
very
fine
fellow
in
consenting
to
a
plan
that
suited
him
so
admirably
and
only
wondered
that
he
had
not
thought
of
it
himself
there
was
nothing
after
his
wife
had
expressed
her
joyful
acceptance
of
it
to
detain
him
in
town
and
he
left
for
ashbridge
that
afternoon
while
michael
moved
into
the
house
in
curzon
street
michael
entered
upon
his
new
life
without
the
smallest
sense
of
having
done
anything
exceptional
or
even
creditable
it
was
so
perfectly
obvious
to
him
that
he
had
to
be
with
his
mother
that
he
had
no
inclination
to
regard
himself
at
all
in
the
matter
the
thing
was
as
simple
as
it
had
been
to
him
to
help
francis
out
of
financial
difficulties
with
a
gift
of
money
there
was
no
effort
of
will
no
sense
of
sacrifice
about
it
it
was
merely
the
assertion
of
a
paramount
instinct
the
life
limited
his
freedom
for
for
a
great
part
of
the
day
he
was
with
his
mother
and
between
his
music
and
his
attendance
on
her
he
had
but
little
leisure
occasionally
he
went
out
to
see
his
friends
but
any
prolonged
absence
on
his
part
always
made
her
uneasy
and
he
would
often
find
her
on
his
return
sitting
in
the
hall
waiting
for
him
so
as
to
enjoy
his
presence
from
the
first
moment
that
he
the
house
but
though
he
found
no
food
for
reflection
in
himself
aunt
barbara
who
came
to
see
them
some
few
days
after
michael
had
been
installed
here
found
a
good
deal
they
had
all
had
tea
together
and
afterwards
lady
ashbridge
s
nurse
had
come
down
to
fetch
her
upstairs
to
rest
and
then
aunt
barbara
surprised
michael
for
she
came
across
the
room
to
him
with
her
kind
eyes
full
of
tears
and
kissed
him
my
dear
i
must
say
it
once
she
said
and
then
you
will
know
that
it
is
always
in
my
mind
you
have
behaved
nobly
michael
it
s
a
big
word
but
i
know
no
other
as
for
your
father
michael
interrupted
her
oh
i
don
t
understand
him
he
said
at
least
that
s
the
best
way
to
look
at
it
let
s
leave
him
he
paused
a
moment
after
all
it
is
a
much
better
plan
than
our
living
all
three
of
us
at
ashbridge
it
s
better
for
my
mother
and
for
me
and
for
i
know
but
how
he
could
consent
to
the
better
plan
she
said
well
let
us
leave
him
out
poor
robert
he
and
his
golf
my
dear
your
father
is
a
very
ludicrous
person
you
know
but
about
you
michael
do
you
think
you
can
stand
it
he
smiled
at
her
why
of
course
i
can
he
said
indeed
i
don
t
think
i
ll
accept
that
statement
of
it
it
s
it
s
such
a
score
to
be
able
to
be
of
use
you
know
i
can
make
my
mother
happy
nobody
else
can
i
think
i
m
getting
rather
conceited
about
yes
dear
i
find
you
insufferable
remarked
aunt
barbara
parenthetically
then
you
must
just
bear
it
the
thing
is
michael
took
a
moment
to
find
the
words
he
searched
for
the
thing
is
i
want
to
be
wanted
well
it
s
no
light
thing
to
be
wanted
by
your
mother
even
if
he
sat
down
on
the
sofa
by
his
aunt
aunt
barbara
how
ironically
gifts
come
he
said
this
was
rather
a
sinister
way
of
giving
that
my
mother
should
want
me
like
this
just
as
her
brain
was
failing
and
yet
that
failure
doesn
t
affect
the
quality
of
her
love
is
it
something
that
shines
through
the
poor
tattered
fabric
anyhow
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
her
brain
it
is
she
herself
somehow
not
anything
of
hers
that
wants
me
and
you
ask
if
i
can
stand
it
michael
with
his
ugly
face
and
his
kind
eyes
and
his
simple
heart
seemed
extraordinarily
charming
just
then
to
aunt
barbara
she
wished
that
sylvia
could
have
seen
him
then
in
all
the
unconsciousness
of
what
he
was
doing
so
unquestioningly
or
that
she
could
have
seen
him
as
she
had
with
his
mother
during
the
last
hour
lady
ashbridge
had
insisted
on
sitting
close
to
him
and
holding
his
hand
whenever
she
could
possess
herself
of
it
of
plying
him
with
a
hundred
repeated
questions
and
never
once
had
she
made
michael
either
ridiculous
or
and
this
she
reflected
went
on
most
of
the
day
and
for
how
many
days
it
would
go
on
none
knew
yet
michael
could
not
consider
even
whether
he
could
stand
it
he
rejected
the
expression
as
meaningless
and
your
friends
she
said
do
you
manage
to
see
them
oh
yes
occasionally
said
michael
they
don
t
come
here
for
the
presence
of
strangers
makes
my
mother
agitated
she
thinks
they
have
some
design
of
taking
her
or
me
away
but
she
wants
to
see
sylvia
she
knows
about
about
her
and
me
and
i
can
t
make
up
my
mind
what
to
do
about
it
she
is
always
asking
if
i
can
t
take
her
to
see
sylvia
or
get
her
to
come
and
why
not
sylvia
knows
about
your
mother
i
i
expect
so
i
told
hermann
but
i
am
afraid
my
mother
will
well
you
can
t
call
it
arguing
but
will
try
to
persuade
her
to
have
me
i
can
t
let
sylvia
in
for
that
nor
if
it
comes
to
that
can
i
let
myself
in
for
can
t
you
impress
on
your
mother
that
she
mustn
t
michael
leaned
forward
to
the
fire
pondering
this
and
stretching
out
his
big
hands
to
the
blaze
yes
i
might
he
said
i
should
love
to
see
sylvia
again
just
see
her
you
know
we
settled
that
the
old
terms
we
were
on
couldn
t
continue
at
least
i
settled
that
and
she
sylvia
is
a
gaby
remarked
aunt
barbara
i
m
rather
glad
you
think
oh
get
her
to
come
said
she
i
m
sure
your
mother
will
do
as
you
tell
her
i
ll
be
here
too
if
you
like
if
that
will
do
any
good
by
the
way
i
see
your
hermann
s
piano
recital
comes
off
i
know
my
mother
wants
to
go
to
that
and
i
think
i
shall
take
her
will
you
come
too
aunt
barbara
and
sit
on
the
other
side
of
her
my
variations
are
going
to
be
played
if
they
are
a
success
hermann
tells
me
i
shall
be
dragged
screaming
on
to
the
platform
and
have
to
bow
lord
and
if
they
re
not
well
lord
yes
my
dear
of
course
i
ll
come
let
me
see
i
shall
have
to
lie
as
i
have
another
engagement
but
a
little
thing
like
that
doesn
t
bother
suddenly
she
clapped
her
hands
together
my
dear
i
quite
forgot
she
said
michael
such
excitement
you
remember
the
boat
you
heard
taking
soundings
on
the
reach
of
course
you
do
well
i
sent
that
information
to
the
proper
quarter
and
since
then
watch
has
been
kept
in
the
woods
just
above
it
last
night
only
the
coastguard
police
caught
four
men
at
it
all
germans
they
tried
to
escape
as
they
did
before
by
rowing
down
the
river
but
there
was
a
steam
launch
below
which
intercepted
them
they
had
on
them
a
chart
of
the
reach
with
soundings
nearly
complete
and
when
they
searched
their
houses
they
are
all
tenants
of
your
astute
father
who
merely
laughed
at
us
they
found
a
very
decent
map
of
certain
private
areas
at
harwich
oh
i
m
not
such
a
fool
as
i
look
they
thanked
me
my
dear
for
my
information
and
i
very
gracefully
said
that
my
information
was
chiefly
got
by
but
did
those
men
live
in
ashbridge
asked
michael
yes
and
your
father
will
have
four
decorous
houses
on
his
hands
i
am
glad
he
should
not
have
laughed
at
us
it
will
teach
him
i
hope
and
now
my
dear
i
must
she
stood
up
and
put
her
hand
on
michael
s
arm
and
you
know
what
i
think
of
you
she
said
evening
then
i
hate
music
usually
but
then
i
adore
hermann
i
only
wish
he
wasn
t
a
german
can
t
you
get
him
to
naturalise
himself
and
his
sister
you
wouldn
t
ask
that
if
you
had
seen
him
in
munich
said
michael
i
suppose
not
patriotism
is
such
a
degrading
emotion
when
it
is
not
michael
s
variations
came
some
down
the
programme
next
evening
and
as
the
moment
for
them
approached
lady
ashbridge
got
more
and
more
excited
i
hope
he
knows
them
by
heart
properly
dear
she
whispered
to
michael
i
shall
be
so
nervous
for
fear
he
ll
forget
them
in
the
middle
which
is
so
liable
to
happen
if
you
play
without
your
michael
laid
his
hand
on
his
mother
s
hush
mother
he
said
you
mustn
t
talk
while
he
s
well
i
was
only
whispering
but
if
you
tell
me
i
mustn
t
the
hall
was
crammed
from
end
to
end
for
not
only
was
hermann
a
person
of
innumerable
friends
but
he
had
already
a
considerable
reputation
and
being
a
german
all
musical
england
went
to
hear
him
and
he
was
playing
superbly
after
a
couple
of
days
of
miserable
nervousness
over
his
debut
as
a
pianist
but
his
temperament
was
one
of
those
that
are
strung
up
to
their
highest
pitch
by
such
nervous
agonies
he
required
just
that
to
make
him
do
full
justice
to
his
own
personality
and
long
before
he
came
to
the
variations
michael
felt
quite
at
ease
about
his
success
there
was
no
question
about
it
any
more
the
whole
audience
knew
that
they
were
listening
to
a
master
in
the
row
immediately
behind
michael
s
party
were
sitting
sylvia
and
her
mother
who
had
not
quite
been
torn
away
from
her
novels
since
she
had
sought
the
love
of
hermione
hogarth
underneath
her
cloak
and
read
it
furtively
in
pauses
they
had
come
in
after
michael
and
until
the
interval
between
the
classical
and
the
modern
section
of
the
concert
he
was
unaware
of
their
presence
then
idly
turning
round
to
look
at
the
crowded
hall
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
girl
i
had
no
idea
you
were
there
he
said
hermann
will
do
won
t
he
i
think
and
then
suddenly
the
words
of
commonplace
failed
him
and
he
looked
at
her
in
silence
i
knew
you
were
back
she
said
hermann
told
me
about
michael
glanced
sideways
indicating
his
mother
who
sat
next
him
and
was
talking
to
barbara
i
wondered
whether
perhaps
you
would
come
and
see
my
mother
and
me
he
said
may
i
write
she
looked
at
him
with
the
friendliness
of
her
smiling
eyes
and
her
grave
mouth
is
it
necessary
to
ask
she
said
michael
turned
back
to
his
seat
for
his
mother
had
had
quite
enough
of
her
and
wanted
him
again
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
for
a
moment
to
see
whom
michael
was
talking
to
i
m
enjoying
my
concert
dear
she
said
and
who
is
that
nice
young
lady
is
she
a
friend
of
yours
the
interval
was
over
and
hermann
returned
to
the
platform
and
waiting
for
a
moment
for
the
buzz
of
conversation
to
die
down
gave
out
without
any
preliminary
excursion
on
the
keys
the
text
of
michael
s
then
he
began
to
tell
them
with
light
and
flying
fingers
what
that
simple
tune
had
suggested
to
michael
how
he
imagined
himself
looking
on
at
an
dance
and
while
the
dancers
moved
to
the
graceful
measure
of
a
minuet
or
daintily
in
a
gavotte
the
tune
of
good
king
wenceslas
still
rang
in
his
head
or
how
in
the
joy
of
the
sunlight
of
a
spring
morning
it
still
haunted
him
it
lay
behind
a
cascade
of
foaming
waters
that
leaping
roared
into
a
ravine
it
marched
with
flying
banners
on
some
day
of
victorious
entry
it
watched
a
funeral
procession
wind
by
with
tapers
and
the
smell
of
incense
it
heard
as
it
got
nearer
back
to
itself
again
the
peals
of
christmas
bells
and
stood
forth
again
in
its
own
person
decorated
and
emblazoned
hermann
had
already
captured
his
audience
now
he
held
them
tame
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
twice
he
bowed
and
then
in
answer
to
the
demand
just
beckoned
with
his
finger
to
michael
who
rose
for
a
moment
his
mother
wished
to
detain
him
you
re
not
going
to
leave
me
my
dear
are
you
she
asked
anxiously
he
waited
to
explain
to
her
quietly
left
her
and
feeling
rather
dazed
made
his
way
round
to
the
back
and
saw
the
open
door
on
to
the
platform
confronting
him
he
felt
that
no
power
on
earth
could
make
him
step
into
the
naked
publicity
there
but
at
the
moment
hermann
appeared
in
the
doorway
come
on
mike
he
said
laughing
thank
the
pretty
ladies
and
gentlemen
lord
isn
t
it
all
a
lark
michael
advanced
with
him
stared
and
hoped
he
smiled
properly
though
he
felt
that
he
was
nailing
some
hideous
grimace
to
his
face
and
then
just
below
him
he
saw
his
mother
eagerly
pointing
him
out
to
a
total
stranger
with
gesticulation
and
just
behind
her
sylvia
looking
at
her
and
not
at
him
with
such
tenderness
such
kindly
pity
there
were
the
two
most
intimately
bound
into
his
life
the
mother
who
wanted
him
the
girl
whom
he
wanted
and
by
his
side
was
hermann
who
as
michael
always
knew
had
thrown
open
the
gates
of
life
to
him
all
the
rest
even
including
aunt
barbara
seemed
of
no
significance
in
that
moment
afterwards
no
doubt
he
would
be
glad
they
were
pleased
be
proud
of
having
pleased
them
but
just
now
even
when
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
intoxicating
wine
of
appreciation
was
given
him
he
stood
with
it
bubbling
and
yellow
in
his
hand
not
drinking
of
it
michael
had
prepared
the
way
of
sylvia
s
coming
by
telling
his
mother
the
identity
of
the
nice
young
lady
at
the
concert
he
had
also
impressed
on
her
the
paramount
importance
of
not
saying
anything
with
regard
to
him
that
could
possibly
embarrass
the
nice
young
lady
and
when
sylvia
came
to
tea
a
few
days
later
he
was
quite
without
any
uneasiness
while
for
himself
he
was
only
conscious
of
that
thirst
for
her
physical
presence
the
desire
as
he
had
said
to
aunt
barbara
just
to
see
nor
was
there
the
slightest
embarrassment
in
their
meeting
it
was
clear
that
there
was
not
the
least
difficulty
either
for
him
or
her
in
being
natural
which
as
usually
happens
was
the
complete
solution
that
is
good
of
you
to
come
he
said
meeting
her
almost
at
the
door
my
mother
has
been
looking
forward
to
your
visit
mother
dear
here
is
miss
lady
ashbridge
was
pathetically
eager
to
be
what
she
called
michael
had
made
it
clear
to
her
that
it
was
his
wish
that
miss
falbe
should
not
be
embarrassed
and
any
wish
just
now
expressed
by
michael
was
of
the
nature
of
a
divine
command
to
her
well
this
is
a
pleasure
she
said
looking
across
to
michael
with
the
eyes
of
a
dog
on
a
beloved
master
and
we
are
not
strangers
quite
are
we
miss
falbe
we
sat
so
near
each
other
to
listen
to
your
brother
who
i
am
sure
plays
beautifully
and
the
music
which
michael
made
haven
t
i
got
a
clever
son
and
such
a
good
one
sylvia
was
unerring
michael
had
known
she
would
be
indeed
you
have
she
said
sitting
down
by
her
and
michael
mustn
t
hear
what
we
say
about
him
must
he
or
he
ll
be
getting
lady
ashbridge
laughed
and
that
would
never
do
would
it
she
said
still
retaining
sylvia
s
hand
then
a
little
dim
ripple
of
compunction
broke
in
her
mind
michael
she
said
we
are
only
joking
about
your
getting
conceited
miss
falbe
and
i
are
only
joking
and
and
won
t
you
take
off
your
hat
miss
falbe
for
you
are
not
going
to
hurry
away
are
you
you
are
going
to
pay
us
a
long
michael
had
not
time
to
remind
his
mother
that
ladies
who
come
to
tea
do
not
usually
take
their
hats
off
for
on
the
word
sylvia
s
hands
were
busy
with
her
hatpins
i
m
so
glad
you
suggested
that
she
said
i
always
want
to
take
my
hat
off
i
don
t
know
who
invented
hats
but
i
wish
he
hadn
lady
ashbridge
looked
at
her
masses
of
bright
hair
and
could
not
help
telegraphing
a
note
of
admiration
as
it
were
to
michael
now
that
s
more
comfortable
she
said
you
look
as
if
you
weren
t
going
away
next
minute
when
i
like
to
see
people
i
hate
their
going
away
i
m
afraid
sometimes
that
michael
will
go
away
but
he
tells
me
he
won
t
and
you
liked
michael
s
music
miss
falbe
was
it
not
clever
of
him
to
think
of
all
that
out
of
one
simple
little
tune
and
he
tells
me
you
sing
so
nicely
perhaps
you
would
sing
to
us
when
we
ve
had
tea
oh
and
here
is
my
do
you
know
her
lady
barbara
my
dear
what
is
your
husband
s
name
seeing
sylvia
uncovered
lady
barbara
with
a
tact
that
was
creditable
to
her
but
strangely
unsuccessful
also
began
taking
off
her
hat
her
was
too
polite
to
interfere
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
did
not
take
much
pleasure
in
the
notion
that
barbara
was
going
to
stay
a
very
long
time
too
she
was
fond
of
her
but
it
was
not
barbara
whom
michael
wanted
she
turned
her
attention
to
the
girl
again
my
husband
s
away
she
said
confidentially
he
is
very
busy
down
at
ashbridge
and
i
daresay
he
won
t
find
time
to
come
up
to
town
for
many
weeks
yet
but
you
know
michael
and
i
do
very
well
without
him
very
well
indeed
and
it
would
never
do
to
take
him
away
from
his
duties
would
it
michael
here
was
a
shoal
to
be
avoided
no
you
mustn
t
think
of
tempting
him
to
come
up
to
town
said
michael
give
me
some
tea
for
aunt
this
answer
entranced
lady
ashbridge
she
had
to
nudge
michael
several
times
to
show
that
she
understood
the
brilliance
of
it
and
put
lump
after
lump
of
sugar
into
barbara
s
cup
in
her
rapt
appreciation
of
it
but
very
soon
she
turned
to
sylvia
again
and
your
brother
is
a
friend
of
michael
s
too
isn
t
he
she
said
some
day
perhaps
he
will
come
to
see
me
we
don
t
see
many
people
michael
and
i
for
we
find
ourselves
very
well
content
alone
but
perhaps
some
day
he
will
come
and
play
his
concert
over
again
to
us
and
then
perhaps
if
you
ask
me
i
will
sing
to
you
i
used
to
sing
a
great
deal
when
i
was
younger
michael
where
has
michael
gone
michael
had
just
left
the
room
to
bring
some
cigarettes
in
from
next
door
and
lady
ashbridge
ran
after
him
calling
him
she
found
him
in
the
hall
and
brought
him
back
triumphantly
now
we
will
all
sit
and
talk
for
a
long
time
she
said
you
one
side
of
me
miss
falbe
and
michael
the
other
or
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
sing
for
us
michael
will
play
for
you
and
would
it
annoy
you
if
i
came
and
turned
over
the
pages
it
would
give
me
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
to
turn
over
for
you
if
you
will
just
nod
each
time
when
you
are
sylvia
got
up
why
of
course
she
said
what
have
you
got
michael
i
haven
t
anything
with
michael
found
a
volume
of
schubert
and
once
again
as
on
the
first
time
he
had
seen
her
she
sang
who
is
sylvia
while
he
played
and
lady
ashbridge
had
her
eyes
fixed
now
on
one
and
now
on
the
other
of
them
waiting
for
their
nod
to
do
her
part
and
then
she
wanted
to
sing
herself
and
with
some
remembrance
of
the
airs
and
graces
of
years
ago
she
put
her
handkerchief
and
her
rings
on
the
top
of
the
piano
and
playing
for
herself
emitted
faint
treble
sounds
which
they
knew
to
be
the
soldier
s
then
presently
her
nurse
came
for
her
to
lie
down
before
dinner
and
she
was
inclined
to
be
tearful
and
refuse
to
go
till
michael
made
it
clear
that
it
was
his
express
and
sovereign
will
that
she
should
do
so
then
very
audibly
she
whispered
to
him
may
i
ask
her
to
give
me
a
kiss
she
said
she
looks
so
kind
michael
i
don
t
think
she
would
sylvia
went
back
home
with
a
little
heartache
for
michael
wondering
if
she
was
in
his
place
if
her
mother
instead
of
being
absorbed
in
her
novels
demanded
such
incessant
attentions
whether
she
had
sufficient
love
in
her
heart
to
render
them
with
the
exquisite
simplicity
the
tender
patience
that
michael
showed
well
as
she
knew
him
greatly
as
she
liked
him
she
had
not
imagined
that
he
or
indeed
any
man
could
have
behaved
quite
like
that
there
seemed
no
effort
at
all
about
it
he
was
not
trying
to
be
patient
he
had
the
sense
of
patience
s
perfect
work
natural
to
him
he
did
not
seem
to
have
to
remind
himself
that
his
mother
was
ill
and
thus
he
must
be
gentle
with
her
he
was
gentle
with
her
because
he
was
in
himself
gentle
and
yet
though
his
behaviour
was
no
effort
to
him
she
guessed
how
wearying
must
be
the
continual
strain
of
the
situation
itself
she
felt
that
she
would
get
cross
from
mere
fatigue
however
excellent
her
intentions
might
be
however
willing
the
spirit
and
no
one
so
she
had
understood
from
barbara
could
take
michael
s
place
in
his
occasional
absences
his
mother
was
fretful
and
miserable
and
day
by
day
michael
left
her
less
she
would
sit
close
to
him
when
he
was
practising
a
thing
that
to
her
or
to
hermann
would
have
rendered
practice
impossible
and
if
he
wrestled
with
one
hand
over
a
difficult
bar
she
would
take
the
other
into
hers
would
ask
him
if
he
was
not
getting
tired
would
recommend
him
to
rest
for
a
little
and
yet
michael
who
last
summer
had
so
stubbornly
insisted
on
leading
his
own
life
and
had
put
his
determination
into
effect
in
the
teeth
of
all
domestic
opposition
now
with
more
than
cheerfulness
laid
his
own
life
aside
in
order
to
look
after
his
mother
sylvia
felt
that
the
real
heroisms
of
life
were
not
so
much
the
fine
heady
deeds
which
are
so
obviously
admirable
as
such
serene
steadfastness
such
unvarying
patience
as
that
which
she
had
just
seen
her
whole
soul
applauded
michael
and
yet
below
her
applause
was
this
heartache
for
him
the
desire
to
be
able
to
help
him
to
bear
the
burden
which
must
be
so
heavy
though
he
bore
it
so
blithely
but
in
the
very
nature
of
things
there
was
but
one
way
in
which
she
could
help
him
and
in
that
she
was
powerless
she
could
not
give
him
what
he
wanted
but
she
longed
to
be
able
to
chapter
xi
it
was
a
morning
of
early
march
and
michael
looking
out
from
the
window
at
the
house
in
curzon
street
where
he
had
just
breakfasted
alone
was
smitten
with
wonder
and
a
secret
ecstasy
for
he
suddenly
saw
and
felt
that
it
was
winter
no
longer
but
that
spring
had
come
for
the
last
week
the
skies
had
screamed
with
outrageous
winds
and
had
been
populous
with
flocks
of
sullen
clouds
that
discharged
themselves
in
sleet
and
snowy
rain
and
half
last
night
for
he
had
slept
very
badly
he
had
heard
the
dashing
of
showers
as
of
spray
against
the
and
had
listened
to
the
fierce
rattling
of
the
frames
towards
morning
he
had
slept
and
during
those
hours
it
seemed
that
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
had
come
into
being
vitally
and
essentially
the
world
was
a
different
affair
altogether
at
the
back
of
the
house
on
to
which
these
windows
looked
was
a
garden
of
some
half
acre
a
square
of
somewhat
sooty
grass
bounded
by
high
walls
with
a
few
trees
at
the
further
end
into
it
too
had
the
message
that
thrilled
through
his
bones
penetrated
and
this
little
oasis
of
doubtful
grass
and
blackened
shrubs
had
a
totally
different
aspect
from
that
which
it
had
worn
all
those
weeks
the
sparrows
that
had
sat
with
feathers
in
corners
sheltered
from
the
gales
were
suddenly
busy
and
shrilly
vocal
chirruping
and
dragging
about
straws
and
flying
from
limb
to
limb
of
the
trees
with
twigs
in
their
beaks
for
the
first
time
he
noticed
that
little
verdant
cabochons
of
folded
leaf
had
globed
themselves
on
the
lilac
bushes
below
the
window
crocuses
had
budded
and
in
the
garden
beds
had
shot
up
the
pushing
spikes
of
bulbs
while
in
the
sooty
grass
he
could
see
specks
and
patches
of
vivid
green
the
first
growth
of
the
year
he
opened
the
window
and
strolled
out
the
whole
taste
and
savour
of
the
air
was
changed
and
borne
on
the
sunshine
came
the
smell
of
damp
earth
no
longer
dead
and
reeking
of
the
decay
of
autumn
but
redolent
with
some
new
element
something
fertile
and
fecund
something
daintily
indefinably
laden
with
the
secret
of
life
and
restoration
the
grey
lumpy
clouds
were
gone
and
instead
chariots
of
dazzling
white
bowled
along
the
infinite
blue
expanse
harnessed
to
the
southwest
wind
but
above
all
the
sparrows
dragged
straws
to
and
fro
loudly
chirruping
all
spring
was
indexed
there
for
a
moment
michael
was
entranced
with
the
exquisite
moment
and
stood
sunning
his
soul
in
spring
but
then
he
felt
the
fetters
of
his
own
individual
winter
heavy
on
him
again
and
he
could
only
see
what
was
happening
without
feeling
it
for
that
moment
he
had
felt
the
leap
in
his
blood
but
the
next
he
was
conscious
again
of
the
immense
fatigue
that
for
weeks
had
been
growing
on
him
the
task
which
he
had
voluntarily
taken
on
himself
had
become
no
lighter
with
habit
the
incessant
attendance
on
his
mother
and
the
strain
of
it
got
heavier
day
by
day
for
some
time
now
her
childlike
content
in
his
presence
had
been
clouded
and
instead
she
was
constantly
depressed
and
constantly
querulous
with
him
finding
fault
with
his
words
and
his
silences
and
in
her
confused
and
muffled
manner
blaming
him
and
affixing
sinister
motives
to
his
most
innocent
actions
but
she
was
still
entirely
dependent
on
him
and
if
he
left
her
for
an
hour
or
two
she
would
wait
in
an
agony
of
anxiety
for
his
return
and
when
he
came
back
overwhelmed
him
with
tearful
caresses
and
the
exaction
of
promises
not
to
go
away
again
then
feeling
certain
of
him
once
more
she
would
start
again
on
complaints
and
reproaches
her
doctor
had
warned
him
that
it
looked
as
if
some
new
phase
of
her
illness
was
approaching
which
might
necessitate
the
complete
curtailment
of
her
liberty
but
day
had
succeeded
to
day
and
she
still
remained
in
the
same
condition
neither
better
nor
worse
but
making
every
moment
a
burden
to
michael
it
had
been
necessary
that
sylvia
should
discontinue
her
visits
for
some
weeks
ago
lady
ashbridge
had
suddenly
taken
a
dislike
to
her
and
when
she
came
would
sit
in
silent
and
lofty
displeasure
speaking
to
her
as
little
as
possible
and
treating
her
with
a
chilling
and
awful
politeness
michael
had
enough
influence
with
his
mother
to
prevent
her
telling
the
girl
what
her
crime
had
been
which
was
her
refusal
to
marry
him
but
when
he
was
alone
with
his
mother
he
had
to
listen
to
torrents
of
these
complaints
lady
ashbridge
with
a
wealth
of
language
that
had
lain
dormant
in
her
all
her
life
sarcastically
supposed
that
miss
falbe
was
a
princess
in
disguise
very
impenetrable
disguise
for
i
m
sure
she
reminds
me
of
a
barmaid
more
than
a
princess
and
thought
that
such
a
marriage
would
be
beneath
her
or
another
time
she
hinted
that
miss
falbe
might
be
already
married
indeed
this
seemed
a
very
plausible
explanation
of
her
attitude
she
desired
in
fact
that
sylvia
should
not
come
to
see
her
any
more
and
now
when
she
did
not
there
was
scarcely
a
day
in
which
lady
ashbridge
would
not
talk
in
a
pointed
manner
about
pretended
friends
who
leave
you
alone
and
won
t
even
take
the
trouble
to
take
a
bus
if
they
are
so
poor
as
all
that
to
come
from
chelsea
to
curzon
street
michael
knew
that
his
mother
s
steps
were
getting
nearer
and
nearer
to
that
border
line
which
separates
the
sane
from
the
insane
and
with
all
the
wearing
strain
of
the
days
as
they
passed
had
but
the
one
desire
in
his
heart
namely
to
keep
her
on
the
right
side
for
as
long
as
was
humanly
possible
but
something
might
happen
some
new
symptom
develop
which
would
make
it
impossible
for
her
to
go
on
living
with
him
as
she
did
now
and
the
dread
of
that
moment
haunted
his
waking
hours
and
his
dreams
two
months
ago
her
doctor
had
told
him
that
for
the
sake
of
everyone
concerned
it
was
to
be
hoped
that
the
progress
of
her
disease
would
be
swift
but
for
his
part
michael
passionately
disclaimed
such
a
wish
in
spite
of
her
constant
complaints
and
strictures
she
was
still
possessed
of
her
love
for
him
and
wearing
though
every
day
was
he
grudged
the
passing
of
the
hours
that
brought
her
nearer
to
the
awful
boundary
line
had
a
deed
been
presented
to
him
for
his
signature
which
bound
him
indefinitely
to
his
mother
s
service
on
the
condition
that
she
got
no
worse
his
pen
would
have
spluttered
with
his
eagerness
to
sign
in
consequence
of
his
mother
s
dislike
to
sylvia
michael
had
hardly
seen
her
during
this
last
month
once
when
owing
to
some
small
physical
disturbance
lady
ashbridge
had
gone
to
bed
early
on
a
sunday
evening
he
had
gone
to
one
of
the
falbes
weekly
parties
and
had
tried
to
fling
himself
with
enjoyment
into
the
friendly
welcoming
atmosphere
but
for
the
present
he
felt
himself
detached
from
it
all
for
this
life
with
his
mother
was
close
round
him
with
a
sort
of
nightmare
obsession
through
which
outside
influence
and
desire
could
only
faintly
trickle
he
knew
that
the
other
life
was
there
he
knew
that
in
his
heart
he
longed
for
sylvia
as
much
as
ever
but
in
his
present
detachment
his
desire
for
her
was
a
drowsy
ache
a
remote
emptiness
and
the
veil
that
lay
over
his
mother
seemed
to
lie
over
him
also
once
indeed
during
the
evening
when
he
had
played
for
her
the
veil
had
lifted
and
for
the
drowsy
ache
he
had
the
sunlit
stabbing
pang
but
as
he
left
the
veil
dropped
again
and
he
let
himself
into
the
big
mute
house
sorry
that
he
had
left
it
in
the
same
way
too
his
music
was
in
abeyance
he
could
not
concentrate
himself
or
find
it
worth
while
to
make
the
effort
to
absorb
himself
in
it
and
he
knew
that
short
of
that
there
was
neither
profit
nor
pleasure
for
him
in
his
piano
everything
seemed
remote
compared
with
the
immediate
foreground
there
was
a
gap
a
gulf
between
it
and
all
the
rest
of
the
world
his
father
wrote
to
him
from
time
to
time
laying
stress
on
the
extreme
importance
of
all
he
was
doing
in
the
country
and
giving
no
hint
of
his
coming
up
to
town
at
present
but
he
faintly
adumbrated
the
time
when
in
the
natural
course
of
events
he
would
have
to
attend
to
his
national
duties
in
the
house
of
lords
and
wondered
whether
it
would
not
about
then
be
good
for
his
wife
to
have
a
change
and
enjoy
the
country
when
the
weather
became
more
propitious
michael
with
an
excusable
unfilialness
did
not
answer
these
amazing
epistles
but
having
basked
in
their
unconscious
humour
sent
them
on
to
aunt
barbara
weekly
reports
were
sent
by
lady
ashbridge
s
nurse
to
his
father
and
michael
had
nothing
whatever
to
add
to
these
his
fear
of
him
had
given
place
to
a
quiet
contempt
which
he
did
not
care
to
think
about
and
certainly
did
not
care
to
express
every
now
and
then
lady
ashbridge
had
what
michael
thought
of
as
a
good
hour
or
two
when
she
went
back
to
her
content
and
childlike
joy
in
his
presence
and
it
was
clear
when
presently
she
came
downstairs
as
he
still
lingered
in
the
garden
reading
the
daily
paper
in
the
sun
that
one
of
these
better
intervals
had
visited
her
she
too
it
appeared
felt
the
waving
of
the
magic
wand
of
spring
and
she
noted
the
signs
of
it
with
a
joy
that
was
infinitely
pathetic
my
dear
she
said
what
a
beautiful
morning
is
it
wise
to
sit
out
of
doors
without
your
hat
michael
shall
not
i
go
and
fetch
it
for
you
no
then
let
us
sit
here
and
talk
it
is
spring
is
it
not
look
how
the
birds
are
collecting
twigs
for
their
nests
i
wonder
how
they
know
that
the
time
has
come
round
again
sweet
little
birds
how
bold
and
merry
they
she
edged
her
way
a
little
nearer
him
so
that
her
shoulder
leaned
on
his
arm
my
dear
i
wish
you
were
going
to
nest
too
she
said
i
wonder
do
you
think
i
have
been
and
unkind
to
your
sylvia
and
that
makes
her
not
come
to
see
me
now
i
do
remember
being
vexed
at
her
for
not
wanting
to
marry
you
and
perhaps
i
talked
unkindly
about
her
i
am
sorry
for
my
being
cross
to
her
will
do
no
good
it
will
only
make
her
more
unwilling
than
ever
to
marry
a
man
who
has
such
an
unpleasant
mamma
will
she
come
to
see
me
again
do
you
think
if
i
ask
her
these
good
hours
were
too
rare
in
their
appearances
and
swift
in
their
vanishings
to
warrant
the
certainty
that
she
would
feel
the
same
this
afternoon
and
michael
tried
to
turn
the
subject
ah
we
shall
have
to
think
about
that
mother
he
said
look
there
is
a
quarrel
going
on
between
those
two
sparrows
they
both
want
the
same
she
followed
his
pointing
finger
easily
diverted
oh
i
wish
they
would
not
quarrel
she
said
it
is
so
sad
and
stupid
to
quarrel
instead
of
being
agreeable
and
pleasant
i
do
not
like
them
to
do
that
there
one
has
flown
away
and
see
the
crocuses
are
coming
up
indeed
it
is
spring
i
should
like
to
see
the
country
if
you
are
not
busy
michael
would
you
take
me
out
into
the
country
we
might
go
to
richmond
park
perhaps
for
that
is
in
the
opposite
direction
from
ashbridge
and
look
at
the
deer
and
the
budding
trees
oh
michael
might
we
take
lunch
with
us
and
eat
it
out
of
doors
i
want
to
enjoy
as
much
as
i
can
of
this
spring
she
clung
closer
to
michael
everything
seems
so
fragile
dear
she
whispered
everything
may
break
sometimes
i
am
the
little
expedition
was
soon
moving
after
a
slight
altercation
between
lady
ashbridge
and
her
nurse
whom
she
wished
to
leave
behind
in
order
to
enjoy
michael
s
undiluted
society
but
miss
baker
who
had
already
spoken
to
michael
telling
him
she
was
not
quite
happy
in
her
mind
about
her
patient
was
firm
about
accompanying
them
though
she
obligingly
effaced
herself
as
far
as
possible
by
taking
the
by
the
chauffeur
as
they
drove
down
and
when
they
arrived
and
michael
and
his
mother
strolled
about
in
the
warm
sunshine
before
lunch
keeping
carefully
in
the
background
just
ready
to
come
if
she
was
wanted
but
indeed
it
seemed
as
if
no
such
precautions
were
necessary
for
never
had
lady
ashbridge
been
more
amenable
more
blissfully
content
in
her
son
s
companionship
the
vernal
hour
that
first
smell
of
the
rejuvenated
earth
as
it
stirred
and
awoke
from
its
winter
sleep
had
reached
her
no
less
than
it
had
reached
the
springing
grass
and
the
heart
of
buried
bulbs
and
never
perhaps
in
all
her
life
had
she
been
happier
than
on
that
balmy
morning
of
early
march
here
the
stir
of
spring
that
had
crept
across
miles
of
smoky
houses
to
the
gardens
behind
curzon
street
was
more
actively
effervescent
and
the
bare
leafless
choirs
of
the
trees
which
had
been
empty
of
song
all
winter
were
once
more
resonant
with
feathered
worshippers
through
the
tussocks
of
the
grey
grass
of
last
year
were
pricking
the
vivid
shoots
of
green
and
over
the
grove
of
young
birches
and
hazel
the
dim
purple
veil
of
spring
hung
mistlike
down
by
the
of
the
penn
ponds
they
strayed
where
scuttled
out
of
rhododendron
bushes
that
overhung
the
lake
and
hurried
across
the
surface
of
the
water
half
swimming
half
flying
for
the
shelter
of
some
securer
retreat
there
too
they
found
a
plantation
of
willows
already
in
bud
with
soft
moleskin
buttons
and
a
tortoiseshell
butterfly
evoked
by
the
sun
from
its
hibernation
settled
on
one
of
the
twigs
opening
and
shutting
its
diapered
wings
and
spreading
them
to
the
warmth
to
thaw
out
the
stiffness
and
inaction
of
winter
blackbirds
fluted
in
the
busy
thickets
a
lark
shot
up
near
them
soaring
and
singing
till
it
became
invisible
in
the
luminous
air
a
suspended
carol
in
the
blue
and
bold
male
chaffinches
seeking
their
mates
with
twittered
songs
fluttered
with
burr
of
throbbing
wings
all
the
promise
of
spring
was
there
dim
fragile
but
sure
on
this
day
of
days
this
pearl
that
emerged
from
the
darkness
and
the
stress
of
winter
iridescent
with
the
tender
colours
of
the
dawning
year
they
lunched
in
the
open
motor
miss
baker
again
obligingly
removing
herself
to
the
box
seat
and
spreading
rugs
on
the
grass
sat
in
the
sunshine
while
lady
ashbridge
talked
or
silently
watched
michael
as
he
smoked
but
always
with
a
smile
the
one
little
note
of
sadness
which
she
had
sounded
when
she
said
she
was
frightened
lest
everything
should
break
had
not
rung
again
and
yet
all
day
michael
heard
it
echoing
somewhere
dimly
behind
the
song
of
the
wind
and
the
birds
and
the
shoots
of
growing
trees
it
lurked
in
the
thickets
just
eluding
him
and
not
presenting
itself
to
his
direct
gaze
but
he
felt
that
he
saw
it
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
only
to
lose
it
when
he
looked
at
it
and
yet
for
weeks
his
mother
had
never
seemed
so
well
the
cloud
had
lifted
off
her
this
morning
and
but
for
some
vague
presage
of
trouble
that
somehow
haunted
his
mind
refusing
to
be
disentangled
he
could
have
believed
that
after
all
medical
opinion
might
be
at
fault
and
that
instead
of
her
passing
more
deeply
into
the
shadows
as
he
had
been
warned
was
inevitable
she
might
at
least
maintain
the
level
to
which
she
had
returned
all
day
she
had
been
as
she
was
before
the
darkness
and
discontent
of
those
last
weeks
had
come
upon
her
he
who
knew
her
now
so
well
could
certainly
have
affirmed
that
she
had
recovered
the
serenity
of
a
month
ago
it
was
so
much
so
tremendously
much
that
she
should
do
this
and
if
only
she
could
remain
as
she
had
been
all
day
she
would
at
any
rate
be
happy
happier
perhaps
than
she
had
consciously
been
in
all
the
stifled
years
which
had
preceded
this
nothing
else
at
the
moment
seemed
to
matter
except
the
preservation
to
her
of
such
content
and
how
eagerly
would
he
have
given
all
the
service
that
his
young
manhood
had
to
offer
if
by
that
he
could
keep
her
from
going
further
into
the
bewildering
darkness
that
he
had
been
told
awaited
her
there
was
some
little
trouble
though
no
more
than
the
shadow
of
a
passing
cloud
when
at
last
he
said
that
they
must
be
getting
back
to
town
for
the
afternoon
was
beginning
to
wane
she
besought
him
for
five
minutes
more
of
sitting
here
in
the
sunshine
that
was
still
warm
and
when
those
minutes
were
over
she
begged
for
yet
another
postponement
but
then
the
quiet
imposition
of
his
will
suddenly
conquered
her
and
she
got
up
my
dear
you
shall
do
what
you
like
with
me
she
said
for
you
have
given
me
such
a
happy
day
will
you
remember
that
michael
it
has
been
a
nice
day
and
might
we
do
you
think
ask
miss
falbe
to
come
to
tea
with
us
when
we
get
back
she
can
but
say
no
and
if
she
comes
i
will
be
very
good
and
not
vex
as
she
got
back
into
the
motor
she
stood
up
for
a
moment
her
vague
blue
eyes
scanning
the
sky
the
trees
the
stretch
of
sunlit
park
lake
happy
lake
and
she
said
trees
and
grass
that
are
growing
green
again
all
pretty
peaceful
michael
had
no
hesitation
in
telephoning
to
sylvia
when
they
got
back
to
town
asking
her
if
she
could
come
and
have
tea
with
his
mother
for
the
gentle
affectionate
mood
of
the
morning
still
lasted
and
her
eagerness
to
see
sylvia
was
only
equalled
by
her
eagerness
to
be
agreeable
to
her
he
was
greedy
whenever
it
could
be
done
to
secure
a
pleasure
for
his
mother
and
this
one
seemed
in
her
present
mood
a
perfectly
safe
one
added
to
that
impulse
in
itself
sufficient
there
was
his
own
longing
to
see
her
again
that
thirst
that
never
left
him
and
soon
after
they
had
got
back
to
curzon
street
sylvia
was
with
them
and
as
before
in
preparation
for
a
long
visit
she
had
taken
off
her
hat
she
divested
herself
of
it
without
any
suggestion
on
lady
ashbridge
s
part
and
this
immensely
pleased
her
look
michael
she
said
miss
falbe
means
to
stop
a
long
time
that
is
sweet
of
her
is
it
not
she
is
not
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
away
today
sugar
miss
falbe
yes
i
remember
you
take
sugar
and
milk
but
no
cream
well
i
do
think
this
is
nice
sylvia
had
seen
neither
mother
nor
son
for
a
couple
of
weeks
and
her
eyes
coming
fresh
to
them
noticed
much
change
in
them
both
in
lady
ashbridge
this
change
though
marked
was
indefinable
enough
she
seemed
to
the
girl
to
have
somehow
gone
much
further
off
than
she
had
been
before
she
had
faded
become
indistinct
it
was
evident
that
she
found
except
when
she
was
talking
to
michael
a
far
greater
difficulty
in
expressing
herself
the
channels
of
communication
as
it
were
were
getting
choked
with
michael
the
change
was
easily
stated
he
looked
terribly
tired
and
it
was
evident
that
the
strain
of
these
weeks
was
telling
heavily
on
him
and
yet
as
sylvia
noticed
with
a
sudden
sense
of
personal
pride
in
him
not
one
jot
of
his
patient
tenderness
for
his
mother
was
abated
tired
as
he
was
nervous
on
edge
whenever
he
dealt
with
her
either
talking
to
her
or
watching
for
any
little
attention
she
might
need
his
face
was
alert
with
love
but
she
noticed
that
when
the
footman
brought
in
tea
and
in
arranging
the
cups
let
a
spoon
slip
jangling
from
its
saucer
michael
jumped
as
if
a
bomb
had
gone
off
and
under
his
breath
said
to
the
man
you
clumsy
fool
little
as
the
incident
was
she
knowing
michael
s
courtesy
and
politeness
found
it
significant
as
bearing
on
the
evidence
of
his
tired
face
then
next
moment
his
mother
said
something
to
him
and
instantly
his
love
transformed
and
irradiated
it
more
than
ever
before
lady
ashbridge
seemed
to
exist
only
through
him
as
sylvia
knew
she
had
been
for
the
last
few
weeks
constantly
disagreeable
to
him
but
she
wondered
whether
this
exacting
meticulous
affection
was
not
harder
to
bear
yet
michael
in
spite
of
the
nervous
strain
which
now
showed
itself
so
clearly
seemed
to
find
no
difficulty
at
all
in
responding
to
it
it
might
have
worn
his
nerves
to
tatters
but
the
tenderness
and
love
of
him
passed
unhampered
through
the
frayed
communications
for
it
was
he
himself
who
was
brought
into
play
it
was
of
that
michael
now
more
and
more
triumphantly
revealed
that
sylvia
felt
so
proud
as
if
he
had
been
a
possession
an
achievement
wholly
personal
to
her
he
was
her
michael
it
was
just
that
which
was
becoming
evident
since
nothing
else
would
account
for
her
claim
of
him
unconsciously
whispered
by
herself
to
herself
it
was
not
long
before
lady
ashbridge
s
nurse
appeared
to
take
her
upstairs
to
rest
at
that
her
patient
became
suddenly
and
unaccountably
agitated
all
the
happy
content
of
the
day
was
wiped
off
her
mind
she
clung
to
michael
no
no
michael
she
said
they
mustn
t
take
me
away
i
know
they
are
going
to
take
me
away
from
you
altogether
you
mustn
t
leave
nurse
baker
came
towards
her
now
my
lady
you
mustn
t
behave
like
that
she
said
you
know
you
are
only
going
upstairs
to
rest
as
usual
before
dinner
you
will
see
lord
comber
again
she
shrank
from
her
shielding
herself
behind
michael
s
shoulder
no
michael
no
she
repeated
i
m
going
to
be
taken
away
from
you
and
look
miss
ah
my
dear
i
have
forgotten
your
name
look
she
has
got
no
hat
on
she
was
going
to
stop
with
me
a
long
time
michael
must
i
go
michael
saw
the
nurse
looking
at
her
watching
her
with
that
quiet
eye
of
the
trained
attendant
then
she
spoke
to
michael
well
if
lord
comber
will
just
step
outside
with
me
she
said
we
ll
see
if
we
can
arrange
for
you
to
stop
a
little
and
you
ll
come
back
michael
said
she
michael
saw
that
the
nurse
wanted
to
say
something
to
him
and
with
infinite
gentleness
disentangled
the
clinging
of
lady
ashbridge
s
hand
why
of
course
i
will
he
said
and
won
t
you
give
miss
falbe
another
cup
of
tea
lady
ashbridge
hesitated
a
moment
yes
i
ll
do
that
she
said
and
by
the
time
i
ve
done
that
you
will
be
back
again
won
t
you
michael
followed
the
nurse
from
the
room
who
closed
the
door
without
shutting
it
there
s
something
i
don
t
like
about
her
this
evening
she
said
all
day
i
have
been
rather
anxious
she
must
be
watched
very
carefully
now
i
want
you
to
get
her
to
come
upstairs
and
i
ll
try
to
make
her
go
to
michael
felt
his
mouth
go
suddenly
dry
what
do
you
expect
he
said
i
don
t
expect
anything
but
we
must
be
prepared
a
change

very
michael
nodded
and
they
went
back
together
now
mother
darling
he
said
up

with
nurse
baker

ve
been
out
all
day
and
you
must
have
a
good
rest
before
dinner

i
come
up
and
see
you
soon
a
curious
sly
look
came
into
lady
ashbridge
s
face
yes
but
where
am
i
going
to
she
said
how
do
i
know
nurse
baker
will
take
me
to
my
own
room
because
i
promise
you
she
will
said
michael
that
instantly
reassured
her
mood
after
mood
as
michael
saw
were
passing
like
shadows
over
her
mind
ah
that
s
enough
she
said
miss
there
the
name
s
gone
again
but
won
t
you
sit
here
and
have
a
talk
to
michael
and
let
him
show
you
over
the
house
to
see
if
you
like
it
against
the
time
oh
michael
said
i
mustn
t
worry
you
about
that
and
won
t
you
stop
and
have
dinner
with
us
and
afterwards
we
can
michael
put
his
arm
around
her
we
ll
talk
about
that
while
you
re
resting
he
said
don
t
keep
nurse
baker
waiting
any
longer
she
nodded
and
smiled
no
no
mustn
t
keep
anybody
waiting
she
said
your
father
taught
me
to
be
when
they
had
left
the
room
together
sylvia
turned
to
michael
michael
my
dear
she
said
i
think
you
are
well
i
think
you
are
she
saw
that
at
the
moment
he
was
not
thinking
of
her
at
all
and
her
heart
honoured
him
for
that
i
m
anxious
about
my
mother
he
said
she
has
been
so
i
suppose
you
must
call
it
well
all
day
but
the
nurse
isn
t
easy
about
suddenly
all
his
fears
and
his
fatigue
and
his
trouble
looked
out
of
his
eyes
i
m
frightened
he
said
and
it
s
so
unutterably
feeble
of
me
and
i
m
tired
you
don
t
know
how
tired
and
try
as
i
may
i
feel
that
all
the
time
it
is
no
use
my
mother
is
slipping
slipping
but
my
dear
no
wonder
you
are
tired
she
said
michael
can
t
anybody
help
it
isn
t
right
you
should
do
he
shook
his
head
smiling
they
can
t
help
he
said
i
m
the
only
person
who
can
help
her
and
i
he
stood
up
bracing
mind
and
body
and
i
m
so
brutally
proud
of
it
he
said
she
wants
me
well
that
s
a
lot
for
a
son
to
be
able
to
say
sylvia
i
would
give
anything
to
keep
still
he
was
not
thinking
of
her
and
knowing
that
she
came
close
to
him
and
put
her
arm
in
his
she
longed
to
give
him
some
feeling
of
comradeship
she
could
be
sisterly
to
him
over
this
without
suggesting
to
him
what
she
could
not
be
to
him
her
instinct
had
divined
right
and
she
felt
the
answering
pressure
of
his
elbow
that
acknowledged
her
sympathy
welcomed
it
and
thought
no
more
about
it
you
are
giving
everything
to
keep
her
she
said
you
are
giving
yourself
what
further
gift
is
there
michael
he
kept
her
arm
close
pressed
by
him
and
she
knew
by
the
frankness
of
that
holding
caress
he
was
thinking
of
her
still
either
not
at
all
or
she
hoped
as
a
comrade
who
could
perhaps
be
of
assistance
to
courage
and
in
difficult
hours
she
wanted
to
be
no
more
than
that
to
him
just
now
it
was
the
most
she
could
do
for
him
but
with
a
desire
the
most
acute
she
had
ever
felt
for
him
she
wanted
him
to
accept
that
to
take
her
comradeship
as
he
would
have
surely
taken
her
brother
s
once
in
the
last
intimate
moments
they
had
had
together
he
had
refused
to
accept
that
attitude
from
her
had
felt
it
a
relationship
altogether
impossible
she
had
seen
his
point
of
view
and
recognised
the
justice
of
the
embarrassment
now
very
simply
but
very
eagerly
she
hoped
as
with
some
tugging
strain
that
he
would
not
reject
it
she
knew
she
had
missed
this
brother
who
had
refused
to
be
brother
to
her
but
he
had
been
about
his
own
business
and
he
had
been
doing
his
own
business
with
a
quiet
splendour
that
drew
her
eyes
to
him
and
as
they
stood
there
thus
linked
she
wondered
if
her
heart
was
following
she
had
seen
last
december
how
reasonable
it
was
of
him
to
refuse
this
domestic
sort
of
intimacy
with
her
now
she
found
herself
intensely
longing
that
he
would
not
persist
in
his
refusal
suddenly
michael
awoke
to
the
fact
of
her
presence
and
abruptly
he
moved
away
from
her
thanks
sylvia
he
said
i
know
i
have
your
your
good
wishes
but
well
i
am
sure
you
she
understood
perfectly
well
and
the
understanding
of
it
cut
her
to
the
quick
have
you
got
any
right
to
behave
like
that
to
me
michael
she
asked
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
treat
me
quite
like
that
he
looked
at
her
completely
recalled
in
mind
to
her
alone
all
the
hopes
and
desires
of
the
autumn
smote
him
with
encompassing
blows
yes
every
right
he
said
i
wasn
t
heeding
you
i
only
thought
of
my
mother
and
the
fact
that
there
was
a
very
dear
friend
by
me
and
then
i
came
to
myself
i
remembered
who
the
friend
they
stood
there
in
silence
apart
for
a
moment
then
michael
came
closer
the
desire
for
human
sympathy
and
that
the
sympathy
he
most
longed
for
gripped
him
again
i
m
a
brute
he
said
it
was
awfully
nice
of
you
to
to
offer
me
that
i
accept
it
so
gladly
i
m
wretchedly
he
looked
up
at
her
take
my
arm
again
he
said
she
felt
the
crook
of
his
elbow
tighten
again
on
her
wrist
she
had
not
known
before
how
much
she
prized
that
but
are
you
sure
you
are
right
in
being
anxious
mike
she
asked
isn
t
it
perhaps
your
own
tired
nerves
that
make
you
anxious
i
don
t
think
so
he
said
i
ve
been
tired
a
long
time
you
see
and
i
never
felt
about
my
mother
like
this
she
has
been
so
bright
and
content
all
day
and
yet
there
were
little
lapses
if
you
understand
it
was
as
if
she
knew
she
said
to
the
lake
and
the
jolly
and
the
grass
and
her
nurse
thinks
so
too
she
called
me
out
of
the
room
just
now
to
tell
me
that
i
don
t
know
why
i
should
tell
you
these
depressing
don
t
you
she
asked
but
i
do
it
s
because
you
know
i
care
otherwise
you
wouldn
t
tell
me
you
couldn
for
a
moment
the
balance
quavered
in
his
mind
between
sylvia
the
beloved
and
sylvia
the
friend
it
inclined
to
the
friend
yes
that
s
why
he
said
and
i
reproach
myself
you
know
all
these
years
i
might
if
i
had
tried
harder
have
been
something
to
my
mother
i
might
have
managed
it
i
thought
at
least
i
felt
that
she
didn
t
encourage
me
but
i
was
a
beast
to
have
been
discouraged
and
now
her
wanting
me
has
come
just
when
it
isn
t
her
unclouded
self
that
wants
me
it
s
as
if
as
if
it
had
been
raining
all
day
and
just
on
sunset
there
comes
a
gleam
in
the
west
and
so
soon
after
it
s
you
made
the
gleam
said
sylvia
but
so
late
so
awfully
suddenly
he
stood
stiff
listening
to
some
sound
which
at
present
she
did
not
hear
it
sounded
a
little
louder
and
her
ears
caught
the
running
of
footsteps
on
the
stairs
outside
next
moment
the
door
opened
and
lady
ashbridge
s
maid
put
in
a
pale
face
will
you
go
to
her
ladyship
my
lord
she
said
her
nurse
wants
you
she
told
me
to
telephone
to
sir
sylvia
moved
with
him
not
disengaging
her
arm
towards
the
door
michael
may
i
wait
she
said
you
might
want
me
you
know
please
let
me
lady
ashbridge
s
room
was
on
the
floor
above
and
michael
ran
up
the
intervening
stairs
three
at
a
time
he
knocked
and
entered
and
wondered
why
he
had
been
sent
for
for
she
was
sitting
quietly
on
her
sofa
near
the
window
but
he
noticed
that
nurse
baker
stood
very
close
to
her
otherwise
there
was
nothing
that
was
in
any
way
out
of
the
ordinary
and
here
he
is
said
the
nurse
reassuringly
as
he
entered
lady
ashbridge
turned
towards
the
door
as
michael
came
in
and
when
he
met
her
eyes
he
knew
why
he
had
been
sent
for
why
at
this
moment
sir
james
was
being
summoned
for
she
looked
at
him
not
with
the
clouded
eyes
of
affection
not
with
the
striving
to
break
through
the
shrouding
trouble
of
her
brain
but
with
eyes
of
blank
she
saw
him
with
the
bodily
organs
of
her
vision
but
the
picture
of
him
was
conveyed
no
further
there
was
a
blank
wall
behind
her
eyes
michael
did
not
hesitate
it
was
possible
that
he
still
might
be
something
to
her
that
he
his
presence
might
penetrate
but
you
are
not
resting
mother
he
said
why
are
you
sitting
up
i
came
to
talk
to
you
as
i
said
i
would
while
you
suddenly
into
those
blank
irresponsive
eyes
there
leaped
recognition
he
saw
the
pupils
contract
as
they
focused
themselves
on
him
and
hand
in
hand
with
recognition
there
leaped
into
them
hate
instantly
that
was
veiled
again
but
it
had
been
there
and
now
it
was
not
banished
it
lurked
behind
in
the
shadows
crouching
and
waiting
she
answered
him
at
once
but
in
a
voice
that
was
quite
toneless
it
seemed
like
that
of
a
child
repeating
a
lesson
which
it
had
learned
by
heart
and
could
be
pronounced
while
it
was
thinking
of
something
quite
different
i
was
waiting
till
you
came
my
dear
she
said
now
i
will
lie
down
come
and
sit
by
me
she
watched
him
narrowly
while
she
spoke
then
gave
a
quick
glance
at
her
nurse
as
if
to
see
that
they
were
not
making
signals
to
each
other
there
was
an
easy
chair
just
behind
her
head
and
as
michael
wheeled
it
up
near
her
sofa
he
looked
at
the
nurse
she
moved
her
hand
slightly
towards
the
left
and
interpreting
this
he
moved
the
chair
a
little
to
the
left
so
that
he
would
not
sit
as
he
had
intended
quite
close
to
the
sofa
and
you
enjoyed
your
day
in
the
country
mother
asked
michael
she
looked
at
him
sideways
and
slowly
then
again
as
if
recollecting
a
task
she
had
committed
to
memory
she
answered
yes
so
much
she
said
all
the
trees
and
the
birds
and
the
sunshine
i
enjoyed
them
so
she
paused
a
moment
bring
your
chair
a
little
closer
my
darling
she
said
you
are
so
far
off
and
why
do
you
wait
nurse
i
will
call
you
if
i
want
michael
felt
one
moment
of
sickening
spiritual
terror
he
understood
quite
plainly
why
nurse
baker
did
not
want
him
to
go
near
to
his
mother
and
the
reason
of
it
gave
him
this
pang
not
of
nervousness
but
of
black
horror
that
the
sane
and
the
sensitive
must
always
feel
when
they
are
brought
intimately
in
contact
with
some
blind
derangement
of
instinct
in
those
most
nearly
allied
to
them
physically
on
the
material
plane
he
had
no
fear
at
all
he
made
a
movement
grasping
the
arm
of
his
chair
as
if
to
wheel
it
closer
but
he
came
actually
no
nearer
her
why
don
t
you
go
away
nurse
said
lady
ashbridge
and
leave
my
son
and
me
to
talk
about
our
nice
day
in
the
country
nurse
baker
answered
quite
naturally
i
want
to
talk
too
my
lady
she
said
i
went
with
you
and
lord
comber
we
all
enjoyed
it
it
seemed
to
michael
that
his
mother
made
some
violent
effort
towards
he
saw
one
of
her
hands
that
were
lying
on
her
knee
clench
itself
so
that
the
knuckles
stood
out
white
yes
we
will
all
talk
together
then
she
said
or
er
shall
i
have
a
little
doze
first
i
am
rather
sleepy
with
so
much
pleasant
air
and
you
are
sleepy
too
are
you
not
michael
yes
i
see
you
look
sleepy
shall
we
have
a
little
nap
as
i
often
do
after
tea
then
when
i
am
fresh
again
you
shall
come
back
nurse
and
we
will
talk
over
our
pleasant
when
he
entered
the
room
michael
had
not
quite
closed
the
door
and
now
as
half
an
hour
before
he
heard
steps
on
the
stairs
a
moment
afterwards
his
mother
heard
them
too
what
is
that
she
said
who
is
coming
now
to
disturb
me
just
when
i
wanted
to
have
a
nap
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
nurse
baker
did
not
move
her
head
but
continued
watching
her
patient
with
hands
ready
to
act
come
in
she
said
not
looking
round
lady
ashbridge
s
face
was
towards
the
door
as
sir
james
entered
she
suddenly
sprang
up
and
in
her
right
hand
that
lay
beside
her
was
a
knife
which
she
had
no
doubt
taken
from
the
when
she
came
upstairs
she
turned
swiftly
towards
michael
and
stabbed
at
him
with
it
it
s
a
trap
she
cried
you
ve
led
me
into
a
trap
they
are
going
to
take
me
michael
had
thrown
up
his
arm
to
shield
his
head
the
blow
fell
between
shoulder
and
elbow
and
he
felt
the
edge
of
the
knife
grate
on
his
bone
and
from
deep
in
his
heart
sprang
the
leaping
fountains
of
compassion
and
love
and
yearning
pity
chapter
xii
michael
was
sitting
in
the
big
studio
at
the
falbes
house
late
one
afternoon
at
the
end
of
june
and
the
warmth
and
murmur
of
the
summer
filled
the
air
the
day
had
so
far
declined
that
the
rays
of
the
sun
level
in
its
setting
poured
slantingly
in
through
the
big
window
to
the
north
and
shining
through
the
foliage
of
the
outside
made
a
diaper
of
rosy
illuminated
spots
and
angled
shadows
on
the
whitewashed
wall
as
the
leaves
stirred
in
the
evening
breeze
this
pattern
shifted
and
twinkled
now
as
the
wind
blew
aside
a
bunch
of
foliage
a
lake
of
rosy
gold
would
spring
up
on
the
wall
then
as
the
breath
of
movement
died
the
green
shadows
grew
thicker
again
faintly
stirring
through
the
window
to
the
south
which
hermann
had
caused
to
be
cut
there
since
the
studio
was
not
used
for
painting
purposes
michael
could
see
into
the
patch
of
garden
where
falbe
was
sitting
in
a
low
basket
chair
completely
absorbed
in
a
book
of
and
ludicrous
adventures
she
had
made
a
mild
attempt
when
she
found
that
michael
intended
to
wait
for
sylvia
s
return
to
entertain
him
till
she
came
but
with
a
little
oblique
encouragement
remarking
on
the
beauty
and
warmth
of
the
evening
and
the
pleasure
of
sitting
out
of
doors
michael
had
induced
her
to
go
out
again
and
leave
him
alone
in
the
studio
free
to
live
over
again
that
which
hours
ago
had
changed
life
for
him
he
reconstructed
it
as
he
sat
on
the
sofa
and
dwelt
on
the
of
it
just
this
time
yesterday
he
had
come
in
and
found
sylvia
alone
she
had
got
up
he
remembered
to
give
him
greeting
and
just
opposite
the
fireplace
they
had
come
face
to
face
she
held
in
her
hand
a
small
white
rose
which
she
had
plucked
in
the
tiny
garden
here
in
the
middle
of
london
it
was
not
a
very
fine
specimen
but
it
was
a
rose
and
she
had
said
in
answer
to
his
depreciatory
glance
but
you
must
see
it
when
i
have
washed
it
one
has
to
wash
london
then
the
miracle
happened
michael
with
the
hand
that
had
just
taken
hers
stroked
a
petal
of
this
prized
vegetable
with
no
thought
in
his
mind
stronger
than
the
thoughts
that
had
been
indigenous
there
since
christmas
as
his
finger
first
touched
the
rim
of
the
petals
undersized
yet
not
quite
lacking
in
he
had
intended
nothing
more
than
to
salute
the
flower
as
sylvia
made
her
apology
for
it
one
has
to
wash
london
but
as
he
touched
it
he
looked
up
at
her
and
the
quiet
usual
song
of
his
thoughts
towards
her
grew
suddenly
loud
and
stupefyingly
sweet
it
was
as
if
from
the
vacant
the
bees
swarmed
in
her
eyes
as
they
met
his
he
thought
he
saw
an
expectancy
a
welcome
and
his
hand
instead
of
stroking
the
closed
on
the
rose
and
on
the
hand
that
held
it
and
kept
them
close
imprisoned
and
strongly
gripped
he
could
not
remember
if
he
had
spoken
any
word
but
he
had
seen
that
in
her
face
which
rendered
all
speech
unnecessary
and
knowing
in
the
bones
and
the
blood
of
him
that
he
was
right
he
kissed
her
and
then
she
had
said
yes
his
hand
still
was
tight
on
hers
that
held
the
crumpled
rose
and
when
he
opened
it
to
stroke
and
kiss
it
there
was
a
spot
of
blood
in
the
palm
of
it
where
a
had
pricked
her
just
one
drop
of
sylvia
s
blood
as
he
kissed
it
he
had
wiped
it
away
with
the
tip
of
his
tongue
between
his
lips
and
she
smiling
had
said
oh
michael
how
silly
they
had
sat
together
on
the
sofa
where
this
afternoon
he
sat
alone
waiting
for
her
every
moment
of
that
half
hour
was
as
distinct
as
the
outline
of
trees
and
hills
just
before
a
storm
and
yet
it
was
still
entirely
he
knew
it
had
happened
for
nothing
but
the
happening
of
it
would
account
now
for
the
fact
of
himself
but
though
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
so
true
there
was
nothing
so
incredible
yet
it
was
all
as
in
his
mind
as
etched
lines
and
round
each
line
sprang
flowers
and
singing
birds
for
a
long
space
there
was
silence
after
they
had
sat
down
and
then
she
said
i
think
i
always
loved
you
michael
only
i
didn
t
know
it
thereafter
foolish
love
talk
he
had
claimed
a
superiority
there
for
he
had
always
loved
her
and
had
always
known
it
much
time
had
been
wasted
owing
to
her
ignorance
she
ought
to
have
known
but
all
the
time
that
existed
was
theirs
now
in
all
the
world
there
was
no
more
time
than
what
they
had
the
crumpled
rose
had
its
petals
rehabilitated
the
thorn
that
had
pricked
her
was
peeled
off
they
wondered
if
hermann
had
come
in
yet
then
by
some
vague
process
of
locomotion
they
found
themselves
at
the
piano
and
with
her
arm
around
his
neck
sylvia
has
whispered
half
a
verse
of
the
song
of
herself
they
became
a
little
more
definite
over
michael
had
so
to
speak
nothing
to
confess
he
had
loved
all
along
he
had
wanted
her
all
along
there
never
had
been
the
least
pretence
or
nonsense
about
it
her
path
was
a
little
more
difficult
to
trace
but
once
it
had
been
traversed
it
was
clear
enough
she
had
liked
him
always
she
had
felt
from
the
moment
when
hermann
brought
him
to
the
house
and
she
had
continued
to
feel
even
when
michael
had
definitely
declared
there
was
no
thoroughfare
there
she
had
missed
that
relationship
when
it
stopped
she
did
not
mind
telling
him
that
now
since
it
was
abandoned
by
them
both
but
not
for
the
world
would
she
have
confessed
before
that
she
had
missed
it
she
had
loved
being
asked
to
come
and
see
his
mother
and
it
was
during
those
visits
that
she
had
helped
to
pile
the
barricade
across
the
with
her
own
hands
she
began
to
share
michael
s
sense
of
the
impossibility
of
that
road
they
could
not
walk
down
it
together
for
they
had
to
be
either
more
or
less
to
each
other
than
that
and
during
these
visits
she
had
begun
to
understand
and
her
face
a
little
hid
itself
what
michael
s
love
meant
she
saw
it
manifested
towards
his
mother
she
was
taught
by
it
she
learned
it
and
she
supposed
she
loved
it
anyhow
having
seen
it
she
could
not
want
michael
as
a
brother
any
longer
and
if
he
still
wanted
anything
else
she
supposed
so
she
supposed
that
some
time
he
would
mention
that
fact
yes
she
began
to
hope
that
he
would
not
be
very
long
about
it
michael
went
over
this
very
deliberately
as
he
sat
waiting
for
her
hours
later
he
rehearsed
this
moment
and
that
over
and
over
again
in
mind
he
followed
himself
and
sylvia
across
to
the
piano
not
hurrying
their
steps
and
going
through
the
verse
of
the
song
she
sang
at
the
pace
at
which
she
actually
sang
it
and
as
he
dreamed
and
recollected
he
heard
a
little
stir
in
the
quiet
house
and
sylvia
came
they
met
just
as
they
met
yesterday
in
front
of
the
fireplace
oh
michael
have
you
been
waiting
long
she
said
yes
hours
or
perhaps
a
couple
of
minutes
i
don
t
ah
but
which
if
hours
i
shall
apologise
and
then
excuse
myself
by
saying
that
you
must
have
come
earlier
than
you
intended
if
minutes
i
shall
praise
myself
for
being
so
exceedingly
minutes
then
said
he
i
ll
praise
you
instead
praise
is
more
convincing
if
somebody
else
does
yes
but
you
aren
t
somebody
else
now
be
sensible
have
you
done
all
the
things
you
told
me
you
were
going
to
do
sylvia
released
her
hands
from
his
tell
me
then
she
said
you
ve
seen
your
father
there
was
no
cloud
on
michael
s
face
there
was
such
sunlight
where
his
soul
sat
that
no
shadow
could
fall
across
it
oh
yes
i
saw
him
he
said
he
captured
sylvia
s
hand
again
and
what
is
more
he
saw
me
so
to
speak
he
said
he
realised
that
i
had
an
existence
independent
of
him
i
used
to
be
a
a
sort
of
clock
to
him
he
could
put
its
hands
to
point
to
any
hour
he
chose
well
he
has
realised
he
has
really
that
i
am
ticking
along
on
my
own
account
he
was
quite
respectful
not
only
to
me
which
doesn
t
matter
but
to
you
which
michael
laughed
as
he
plaited
his
fingers
in
with
hers
my
father
is
so
comic
he
said
and
unlike
most
great
humourists
his
humour
is
absolutely
unconscious
he
was
perfectly
well
aware
that
i
meant
to
marry
you
for
i
told
him
that
last
christmas
adding
that
you
did
not
mean
to
marry
me
so
since
then
i
think
he
s
got
used
to
you
used
to
you
fancy
getting
used
to
you
especially
since
he
had
never
seen
me
said
the
girl
that
makes
it
less
odd
getting
used
to
you
after
seeing
you
would
be
much
more
incredible
i
was
saying
that
in
a
way
he
had
got
used
to
you
just
as
he
s
got
used
to
my
being
a
person
and
not
a
clock
on
his
and
what
seems
to
have
made
so
much
difference
is
what
aunt
barbara
told
him
last
night
namely
that
your
mother
was
a
tracy
sylvia
don
t
let
it
be
too
much
for
you
but
in
a
certain
manner
he
realises
that
you
are
one
of
isn
t
he
a
comic
he
s
going
to
make
the
best
of
you
it
appears
to
make
the
best
of
you
you
can
t
beat
that
you
know
in
fact
he
told
me
to
ask
if
he
might
come
and
pay
his
respects
to
your
mother
and
what
about
my
singing
my
career
she
asked
michael
laughed
again
he
was
funny
about
that
also
he
said
my
father
took
it
absolutely
for
granted
that
having
made
this
tremendous
social
advance
you
would
bury
your
past
all
but
the
tracy
part
of
it
as
if
it
had
been
something
disgraceful
which
the
exalted
comber
family
agreed
to
and
what
did
you
say
i
oh
i
told
him
that
of
course
you
would
do
as
you
pleased
about
that
but
that
for
my
part
i
should
urge
you
most
strongly
to
do
nothing
of
the
and
he
he
got
four
inches
taller
what
is
so
odd
is
that
as
long
as
i
never
opposed
my
father
s
wishes
as
long
as
i
was
the
clock
on
the
chimney
piece
i
was
terrified
at
him
the
thought
of
opposing
myself
to
him
made
my
knees
quake
but
the
moment
i
began
doing
so
i
found
there
was
nothing
to
be
frightened
sylvia
got
up
and
began
walking
up
and
down
the
long
room
but
what
am
i
to
do
about
it
michael
she
asked
oh
i
blush
when
i
think
of
a
conversation
i
had
with
hermann
about
you
just
before
christmas
when
i
knew
you
were
going
to
propose
to
me
i
said
that
i
could
never
give
up
my
singing
can
you
picture
the
of
that
why
it
doesn
t
seem
to
me
to
matter
two
straws
whether
i
do
or
not
naturally
i
don
t
want
to
earn
my
living
by
it
any
more
but
whether
i
sing
or
not
doesn
t
matter
and
even
as
the
words
are
in
my
mouth
i
try
to
imagine
myself
not
singing
any
more
and
i
can
t
it
s
become
part
of
me
and
while
i
blush
to
think
of
what
i
said
to
hermann
i
wonder
whether
it
s
not
she
came
and
sat
down
by
him
again
i
believe
you
have
got
enough
artistic
instinct
to
understand
that
michael
she
said
and
to
know
what
a
tremendous
help
it
is
to
one
s
art
to
be
a
professional
and
to
be
judged
seriously
i
suppose
that
ideally
if
one
loves
music
as
i
do
one
ought
to
be
able
to
do
one
s
very
best
whether
one
is
singing
professionally
or
not
but
it
is
hardly
possible
why
the
whole
difference
between
amateurs
and
professionals
is
that
amateurs
sing
charmingly
and
professionals
just
sing
only
they
sing
as
well
as
they
possibly
can
not
only
because
they
love
it
but
because
if
they
don
t
they
will
be
dropped
on
to
and
if
they
continue
not
singing
their
best
will
lose
their
place
which
they
have
so
hardly
won
i
can
see
myself
perhaps
not
singing
at
all
literally
never
opening
my
lips
in
song
again
but
i
can
t
see
myself
coming
down
to
the
drill
hall
at
brixton
extremely
beautifully
dressed
with
rows
of
pearls
and
arriving
rather
late
and
just
singing
charmingly
it
s
such
a
spur
to
know
that
serious
musicians
judge
one
s
performance
by
the
highest
possible
standard
it
s
so
relaxing
to
think
that
one
can
easily
sing
well
enough
that
one
can
delight
hundredths
of
the
audience
without
any
real
effort
i
could
sing
the
lost
chord
and
move
the
whole
drill
hall
at
brixton
to
tears
but
there
might
be
one
man
there
who
knew
you
or
hermann
or
some
other
and
at
the
end
he
would
just
shrug
his
shoulders
ever
so
slightly
and
i
would
wish
i
had
never
been
she
paused
a
moment
i
ll
not
sing
any
more
at
all
ever
she
said
or
i
must
sing
to
those
who
will
take
me
seriously
and
judge
me
ruthlessly
to
sing
just
well
enough
to
please
isn
t
possible
i
ll
do
either
you
falbe
strayed
in
at
this
moment
with
her
finger
in
her
book
but
otherwise
as
purposeless
as
a
wandering
mist
i
was
afraid
it
might
be
going
to
get
chilly
she
remarked
after
a
hot
day
there
is
often
a
cool
evening
will
you
stop
and
dine
lord
i
mean
michael
please
certainly
said
michael
then
i
hope
there
will
be
something
for
you
to
eat
sylvia
is
there
something
to
eat
no
doubt
you
will
see
to
that
darling
i
shall
just
rest
upstairs
for
a
little
before
dinner
and
perhaps
finish
my
book
so
pleased
you
are
she
drifted
towards
the
studio
door
in
thistledown
fashion
catching
at
corners
a
little
and
then
moving
smoothly
on
again
talking
gently
half
to
herself
half
to
the
others
and
hermann
s
not
in
yet
but
if
lord
i
mean
michael
is
going
to
stop
here
till
dinnertime
it
won
t
matter
whether
hermann
comes
in
in
time
to
dress
or
not
as
michael
is
not
dressed
either
oh
there
is
the
postman
s
knock
what
a
noise
i
am
not
expecting
any
the
knock
in
question
however
proved
to
be
hermann
who
as
was
generally
the
case
had
forgotten
his
latchkey
he
ran
into
his
mother
at
the
studio
door
and
came
and
sat
down
regardless
of
whether
he
was
wanted
or
not
between
the
two
on
the
sofa
and
took
an
arm
of
each
i
probably
intrude
he
said
but
such
is
my
intention
i
ve
just
seen
lady
barbara
who
says
that
the
shock
has
not
been
too
much
for
mike
s
father
that
is
a
good
thing
she
says
he
is
taking
nourishment
much
as
usual
i
suppose
i
oughtn
t
to
jest
on
so
serious
a
subject
but
i
took
my
cue
from
lady
barbara
it
appears
that
we
have
blue
blood
too
sylvia
and
we
must
behave
more
like
aristocrats
a
tracy
in
the
time
of
king
john
flirted
if
no
more
with
a
comber
and
what
about
your
career
sylvia
are
you
going
to
continue
to
urge
your
wild
career
or
not
i
ask
with
a
purpose
as
blackiston
proposes
we
should
give
a
concert
together
in
the
third
week
in
july
the
queen
s
hall
is
vacant
one
afternoon
and
he
thinks
we
might
sing
and
play
to
them
i
m
on
if
you
are
it
will
be
about
the
last
concert
of
the
season
too
so
we
shall
have
to
do
our
best
otherwise
we
or
i
anyhow
will
start
again
in
the
autumn
with
a
black
mark
by
the
way
are
you
going
to
start
again
in
the
autumn
it
wouldn
t
surprise
me
one
bit
to
hear
that
you
and
mike
had
been
talking
about
just
don
t
be
too
clever
to
live
hermann
said
sylvia
i
don
t
propose
to
die
if
you
mean
that
oh
blackiston
had
another
suggestion
also
he
wanted
to
know
if
we
would
consider
making
a
short
tour
in
germany
in
the
autumn
he
says
that
the
beloved
fatherland
is
rather
disposed
to
be
interested
in
us
he
thinks
we
should
have
good
audiences
at
leipzig
and
so
on
there
s
a
tendency
he
says
to
recognise
poor
england
a
cordial
intention
anyhow
i
said
that
in
your
case
there
might
be
domestic
considerations
which
but
i
think
i
shall
go
in
any
case
lord
fancy
playing
in
germany
to
germans
again
fancy
being
listened
to
by
a
german
audience
fancy
if
they
michael
leaned
forward
putting
his
elbow
into
hermann
s
chest
early
december
had
already
been
mentioned
as
a
date
for
their
marriage
and
as
a
journey
this
seemed
to
him
a
plan
ecstatically
ideal
yes
sylvia
he
said
the
answer
is
yes
i
shall
come
with
you
you
know
i
can
see
it
a
triumphal
procession
you
two
making
noises
and
me
listening
a
month
s
tour
hermann
middle
of
october
till
middle
of
november
yes
all
his
tremendous
pride
in
her
singing
dormant
for
the
moment
under
the
wonder
of
his
love
rose
to
the
surface
he
knew
what
her
singing
meant
to
her
and
from
their
conversation
together
just
now
how
keen
was
her
eagerness
for
the
strict
judgment
of
those
who
knew
how
she
loved
that
austere
pinnacle
of
daylight
here
was
an
ideal
opportunity
never
yet
since
she
had
won
her
place
as
a
singer
had
she
sung
in
germany
that
mecca
of
the
musical
artist
and
in
her
case
the
land
from
which
she
sprung
had
the
scheme
implied
a
postponement
of
their
marriage
he
would
still
have
declared
himself
for
it
for
he
unerringly
felt
for
her
in
this
he
knew
intuitively
what
delicious
beckoning
this
held
for
her
yes
yes
he
repeated
i
must
have
you
do
that
sylvia
i
don
t
care
what
hermann
wants
or
what
you
want
i
want
yes
but
who
s
to
do
the
playing
and
the
singing
asked
hermann
isn
t
it
a
question
perhaps
for
michael
felt
quite
secure
about
the
feelings
of
the
other
two
and
rudely
interrupted
no
he
said
it
s
a
question
for
me
when
the
fatherland
hears
that
i
am
there
it
will
no
doubt
ask
me
to
play
and
sing
instead
of
you
two
lord
fancy
marrying
into
such
a
distinguished
family
i
burst
with
pride
it
required
then
little
debate
since
all
three
were
agreed
before
hermann
was
empowered
with
authority
to
make
arrangements
and
they
remained
simultaneously
talking
till
falbe
again
drifting
in
announced
that
the
bell
for
dinner
had
sounded
some
minutes
before
she
had
her
finger
in
the
last
chapter
of
lady
ursula
s
ordeal
and
laid
it
face
downwards
on
the
table
to
resume
again
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
this
opportunity
was
granted
her
when
at
the
close
of
dinner
coffee
and
the
evening
paper
came
in
together
this
hermann
opened
at
the
middle
page
hallo
he
said
that
s
horrible
the
heir
apparent
of
the
austrian
emperor
has
been
murdered
at
serajevo
servian
plot
oh
what
a
dreadful
thing
said
falbe
opening
her
book
poor
man
what
had
he
done
hermann
took
a
cigarette
frowning
it
may
be
a
match
he
began
falbe
diverted
her
attention
from
lady
ursula
for
a
moment
they
are
on
the
dear
she
said
thinking
he
spoke
of
material
matches
michael
felt
that
hermann
saw
something
or
conjectured
something
ominous
in
this
news
for
he
sat
with
knitted
brow
reading
and
letting
the
match
burn
down
yes
it
seems
that
servian
officers
are
implicated
he
said
and
there
are
materials
enough
already
for
a
row
between
austria
and
servia
without
those
tiresome
balkan
states
said
falbe
slowly
immersing
herself
like
a
diving
submarine
in
her
book
they
are
always
quarrelling
why
doesn
t
austria
conquer
them
all
and
have
done
with
it
this
simple
and
striking
solution
of
the
whole
balkan
question
was
her
final
contribution
to
the
topic
for
at
this
moment
she
became
completely
submerged
and
cut
off
so
to
speak
from
the
outer
world
in
the
lucent
depths
of
lady
ursula
hermann
glanced
through
the
other
pages
and
let
the
paper
slide
to
the
floor
what
will
austria
do
he
said
supposing
she
threatens
servia
in
some
outrageous
way
and
russia
says
she
won
t
stand
it
what
then
michael
looked
across
to
sylvia
he
was
much
more
interested
in
the
way
she
dabbled
the
tips
of
her
hands
in
the
cool
water
of
her
finger
bowl
than
in
what
hermann
was
saying
her
fingers
had
an
extraordinary
life
of
their
own
just
now
they
were
like
a
group
of
maidens
by
a
fountain
but
hermann
repeated
the
question
to
him
personally
oh
i
suppose
there
will
be
a
lot
of
telegraphing
he
said
and
perhaps
a
board
of
arbitration
after
all
one
expected
a
european
conflagration
over
the
war
in
the
balkan
states
and
again
over
their
row
with
turkey
i
don
t
believe
in
european
conflagrations
we
are
all
too
much
afraid
of
each
other
we
walk
round
each
other
like
collie
dogs
on
the
tips
of
their
toes
gently
growling
and
then
quietly
get
back
to
our
own
territories
and
lie
down
hermann
laughed
thank
god
there
s
that
wonderful
in
germany
ready
to
turn
the
hose
on
what
asked
michael
the
emperor
of
course
we
should
have
been
at
war
ten
times
over
but
for
sylvia
dried
her
one
by
one
lady
barbara
doesn
t
quite
take
that
view
of
him
does
she
mike
she
asked
michael
suddenly
remembered
how
one
night
in
the
flat
aunt
barbara
had
suddenly
turned
the
conversation
from
the
discussion
of
cognate
topics
on
hearing
that
the
falbes
were
germans
only
to
resume
it
again
when
they
had
gone
i
don
t
fancy
she
does
he
said
but
then
as
you
know
aunt
barbara
has
original
views
on
every
hermann
did
not
take
the
possible
hint
here
conveyed
to
drop
the
matter
well
then
what
do
you
think
about
him
he
asked
michael
laughed
my
dear
hermann
he
said
how
often
have
you
told
me
that
we
english
don
t
pay
the
smallest
attention
to
international
politics
i
am
aware
that
i
don
t
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
hermann
shook
off
the
cloud
of
preoccupation
that
so
unaccountably
to
michael
s
thinking
had
descended
on
him
and
walked
across
to
the
window
well
long
may
ignorance
be
bliss
he
said
lord
what
a
divine
evening
uber
allen
gipfeln
ist
at
least
there
is
peace
on
the
only
summits
visible
which
are
house
roofs
there
s
not
a
breath
of
wind
in
the
trees
and
and
it
s
hot
it
s
really
i
was
afraid
there
was
going
to
be
a
chill
at
sunset
remarked
falbe
subaqueously
then
you
were
afraid
even
where
no
fear
was
mother
darling
said
he
and
if
you
would
like
to
sit
out
in
the
garden
i
ll
take
a
chair
out
for
you
and
a
table
and
candles
let
s
all
sit
out
it
s
a
divine
hour
this
hour
after
sunset
there
are
but
a
score
of
days
in
the
whole
year
when
the
hour
after
sunset
is
warm
like
this
it
s
such
a
pity
to
waste
one
indoors
the
young
people
and
he
pointed
to
sylvia
and
michael
will
gaze
into
each
other
s
hearts
and
mamma
s
will
beat
in
unison
with
lady
ursula
s
and
i
will
sit
and
look
at
the
sky
and
become
profoundly
sentimental
like
a
good
hermann
and
michael
bestirred
themselves
and
presently
the
whole
little
party
had
encamped
on
chairs
placed
in
an
oasis
of
rugs
this
was
done
at
the
special
request
of
falbe
since
lady
ursula
had
caught
a
chill
that
developed
into
consumption
in
the
small
garden
beyond
at
the
bottom
lay
the
road
along
the
embankment
and
the
thames
and
the
dim
woods
of
battersea
park
across
the
river
when
they
came
out
sparrows
were
still
chirping
in
the
ivy
on
the
studio
wall
and
in
the
tall
planes
at
the
bottom
of
the
little
plot
discussing
no
doubt
the
domestic
arrangements
for
their
comfort
during
the
night
but
presently
a
sudden
hush
fell
upon
them
and
their
shrillness
was
sharp
no
more
against
the
drowsy
hum
of
the
city
the
sky
overhead
was
of
veiled
blue
growing
gradually
more
toneless
as
the
light
faded
and
was
unflecked
by
any
cloud
except
where
high
in
the
zenith
a
fleece
of
rosy
vapour
still
caught
the
light
of
the
sunken
sun
and
flamed
with
the
soft
radiance
of
some
near
it
there
burned
a
molten
planet
growing
momentarily
brighter
as
the
night
gathered
and
presently
beginning
to
be
dimmed
again
as
a
tawny
moon
three
days
past
the
full
rose
in
the
east
above
the
low
river
horizon
occasionally
a
steamer
hooted
from
the
thames
and
the
noise
of
churned
waters
sounded
or
the
crunch
of
a
motor
s
wheels
or
the
tapping
of
the
heels
of
a
foot
passenger
on
the
pavement
below
the
garden
wall
but
such
evidence
of
outside
seemed
but
to
accentuate
the
perfect
peace
of
this
secluded
little
garden
where
the
four
sat
the
hour
and
the
place
were
cut
off
from
all
turmoil
and
activities
for
a
moment
the
stream
of
all
their
lives
had
flowed
into
a
backwater
where
it
rested
immobile
before
the
travel
that
was
yet
to
come
so
it
seemed
to
michael
then
and
so
years
afterwards
it
seemed
to
him
as
vividly
as
on
this
evening
when
the
tawny
moon
grew
golden
as
it
climbed
the
empty
heavens
dimming
the
stars
around
it
what
they
talked
of
even
though
it
was
sylvia
who
spoke
seemed
external
to
the
spirit
of
the
hour
they
seemed
to
have
reached
a
point
some
momentary
where
speech
and
thought
even
lay
outside
and
the
need
of
the
spirit
was
merely
to
exist
and
be
conscious
of
its
existence
sometimes
for
a
moment
his
past
life
with
its
its
mute
yearnings
its
chrysalis
stirrings
formed
a
mist
that
dispersed
again
sometimes
for
a
moment
in
wonder
at
what
the
future
held
what
joys
and
troubles
what
achings
perhaps
and
anguishes
the
unknown
knocked
stealthily
at
the
door
of
his
mind
but
then
stole
away
unanswered
and
unwelcome
and
for
that
hour
while
falbe
finished
with
lady
ursula
while
hermann
smoked
and
sighed
like
a
sentimental
german
and
while
he
and
sylvia
sat
speaking
occasionally
but
more
often
silent
he
was
in
some
kind
of
nirvana
for
which
its
own
existence
was
everything
movement
had
ceased
he
held
his
breath
while
that
divine
pause
lasted
when
it
was
broken
there
was
no
shattering
of
it
it
simply
died
away
like
a
chord
as
falbe
closed
her
book
she
died
she
said
i
knew
she
hermann
gave
a
great
shout
of
laughter
darling
mother
i
m
ever
so
much
obliged
he
said
we
had
to
return
to
earth
somehow
where
has
everybody
else
been
michael
stirred
in
his
chair
i
ve
been
here
he
said
how
dull
oh
i
suppose
that
s
not
polite
to
sylvia
i
ve
been
in
leipzig
and
in
frankfort
and
in
munich
you
and
sylvia
have
been
there
too
i
may
tell
you
but
i
ve
also
been
here
it
s
jolly
his
sentimentalism
had
apparently
not
quite
passed
from
him
ah
we
ve
stolen
this
hour
he
said
we
ve
taken
it
out
of
the
and
had
it
to
ourselves
it
s
been
ripping
but
i
m
back
from
the
rim
of
the
world
oh
i
ve
been
there
too
and
looked
out
over
the
immortal
sea
lieber
gott
what
a
sea
where
we
all
come
from
and
where
we
all
go
to
we
re
just
playing
on
the
sand
where
the
waves
have
cast
us
up
for
one
little
hour
oh
the
pleasant
warm
sand
and
the
play
how
i
love
he
got
out
of
his
chair
stretching
himself
as
falbe
passed
into
the
house
and
gave
a
hand
on
each
side
to
michael
and
sylvia
ah
it
was
a
good
thing
i
just
caught
that
train
at
victoria
nearly
a
year
ago
he
said
if
i
had
been
five
seconds
later
i
should
have
missed
it
and
so
i
should
have
missed
my
friend
and
sylvia
would
have
missed
hers
and
mike
would
have
missed
his
as
it
is
here
we
all
are
behold
the
last
remnant
of
my
german
sentimentality
evaporates
but
i
am
filled
with
a
german
desire
for
beer
let
us
come
into
the
studio
liebe
kinder
and
have
beer
and
music
and
laughter
we
can
not
recapture
this
hour
or
prolong
it
but
it
was
good
oh
so
good
i
thank
god
for
this
sylvia
put
her
hand
on
her
brother
s
arm
looking
at
him
with
just
a
shade
of
anxiety
nothing
wrong
hermann
she
asked
wrong
there
is
nothing
wrong
unless
it
is
wrong
to
be
happy
but
we
have
to
go
forward
my
only
quarrel
with
life
is
that
i
would
stop
it
now
if
i
could
so
that
time
should
not
run
on
and
we
should
stay
just
as
we
are
ah
what
does
the
future
hold
i
am
glad
i
do
not
sylvia
laughed
the
immediate
future
holds
beer
apparently
she
said
it
also
hold
a
great
deal
of
work
for
you
and
me
if
it
is
to
hold
leipzig
and
frankfort
and
munich
oh
hermann
what
glorious
days
they
walked
together
into
the
studio
and
as
they
entered
hermann
looked
back
over
her
into
the
dim
garden
then
he
pulled
down
the
blind
with
a
rattle
move
on
there
said
the
policeman
he
remarked
and
so
they
moved
the
news
about
the
murder
of
the
austrian
grand
duke
which
for
that
moment
at
dinner
had
caused
hermann
to
peer
with
apprehension
into
the
veil
of
the
future
was
taken
quietly
enough
by
the
public
in
general
in
england
it
was
a
nasty
incident
no
doubt
and
the
murder
having
been
committed
on
servian
soil
the
pundits
of
the
press
gave
themselves
an
opportunity
for
subsequently
saying
that
they
were
right
by
conjecturing
that
austria
might
insist
on
a
strict
inquiry
into
the
circumstances
and
the
due
punishment
of
not
only
the
actual
culprits
but
of
those
also
who
perhaps
were
privy
to
the
plot
but
three
days
afterwards
there
was
but
little
uneasiness
the
stock
exchanges
of
the
european
capitals
those
highly
sensitive
barometers
of
coming
storm
were
but
slightly
affected
for
the
moment
and
within
a
week
had
steadied
themselves
again
from
austria
there
came
no
sign
of
any
unreasonable
demand
which
might
lead
to
trouble
with
servia
and
so
with
slavonic
feeling
generally
and
by
degrees
that
threatening
of
storm
that
sudden
lightning
on
the
horizon
passed
out
of
the
mind
of
the
public
there
had
been
that
one
flash
no
more
and
even
that
had
not
been
answered
by
any
growl
of
thunder
the
storm
did
not
at
once
move
up
and
the
heavens
above
were
still
clear
and
sunny
by
day
and
at
night
but
here
and
there
were
those
who
like
hermann
on
the
first
announcement
of
the
catastrophe
scented
trouble
and
michael
going
to
see
aunt
barbara
one
afternoon
early
in
the
second
week
of
july
found
that
she
was
one
of
them
i
distrust
it
all
my
dear
she
said
to
him
i
am
full
of
uneasiness
and
what
makes
me
more
uneasy
is
that
they
are
taking
it
so
quietly
at
the
austrian
embassy
and
at
the
german
i
dined
at
one
embassy
last
night
and
at
the
other
only
a
few
nights
ago
and
i
can
t
get
anybody
not
even
the
most
indiscreet
of
the
secretaries
to
say
a
word
about
but
perhaps
there
isn
t
a
word
to
be
said
suggested
michael
i
can
t
believe
that
austria
can
not
possibly
let
an
incident
of
that
sort
pass
there
is
mischief
brewing
if
she
was
merely
intending
to
insist
as
she
has
every
right
to
do
on
an
inquiry
being
held
that
should
satisfy
reasonable
demands
for
justice
she
would
have
insisted
on
that
long
ago
but
a
fortnight
has
passed
now
and
still
she
makes
no
sign
i
feel
sure
that
something
is
being
arranged
dear
me
i
quite
forgot
tony
asked
me
not
to
talk
about
it
but
it
doesn
t
matter
with
but
what
do
you
mean
by
something
being
arranged
asked
michael
she
looked
round
as
if
to
assure
herself
that
she
and
michael
were
alone
i
mean
this
that
austria
is
being
persuaded
to
make
some
outrageous
demand
some
demand
that
no
independent
country
could
possibly
but
who
is
persuading
her
asked
michael
my
dear
you
like
all
the
rest
of
england
are
fast
asleep
who
but
germany
and
that
dangerous
monomaniac
who
rules
germany
she
has
long
been
wanting
war
and
she
has
only
been
delaying
the
dawning
of
der
tag
till
all
her
preparations
were
complete
and
she
was
ready
to
hurl
her
armies
and
her
fleet
too
east
and
west
and
north
mark
my
words
she
is
about
ready
now
and
i
believe
she
is
going
to
take
advantage
of
her
she
leaned
forward
in
her
chair
it
is
such
an
opportunity
as
has
never
occurred
before
she
said
and
in
a
hundred
years
none
so
fit
may
occur
again
here
are
we
england
on
the
brink
of
civil
war
with
ireland
and
the
home
rulers
our
hands
are
tied
or
rather
are
occupied
with
our
own
troubles
anyhow
germany
thinks
so
that
i
know
for
a
fact
among
so
much
that
is
only
conjecture
and
perhaps
she
is
right
who
knows
whether
she
may
not
be
right
and
that
if
she
forces
on
war
whether
we
shall
range
ourselves
with
our
allies
michael
laughed
but
aren
t
you
piling
up
a
european
conflagration
rather
in
a
hurry
aunt
barbara
he
asked
there
will
be
hurry
enough
for
us
for
france
and
russia
and
perhaps
england
but
not
for
germany
she
is
never
in
a
hurry
she
waits
till
she
is
a
servant
brought
in
tea
and
lady
barbara
waited
till
he
had
left
the
room
again
it
is
as
simple
as
an
addition
sum
she
said
if
you
grant
the
first
step
that
austria
is
going
to
make
some
outrageous
demand
of
servia
what
follows
servia
refuses
that
demand
and
austria
begins
mobilisation
in
order
to
enforce
it
servia
appeals
to
russia
invokes
the
bond
of
blood
and
russia
remonstrates
with
austria
her
representations
will
be
of
no
use
you
may
stake
all
you
have
on
that
and
eventually
since
she
will
be
unable
to
draw
back
she
too
will
begin
in
her
slow
cumbrous
manner
hampered
by
those
immense
distances
and
her
imperfect
railway
system
to
mobilise
also
then
will
germany
already
quite
prepared
show
her
hand
she
will
demand
that
russia
shall
cease
mobilisation
and
again
will
russia
refuse
that
will
set
the
military
machinery
of
france
going
all
the
time
the
governments
of
europe
will
be
working
for
peace
all
that
is
except
one
which
is
situated
at
michael
felt
inclined
to
laugh
at
this
rapid
and
disastrous
sequence
of
ominous
forebodings
it
was
so
completely
characteristic
of
aunt
barbara
to
take
the
most
violent
possible
view
of
the
situation
which
no
doubt
had
its
dangers
and
what
michael
felt
was
felt
by
the
enormous
majority
of
english
people
dear
aunt
barbara
you
do
get
on
quick
he
said
it
will
happen
quickly
she
said
there
is
that
little
cloud
in
the
east
like
a
man
s
hand
today
and
rather
like
that
mailed
fist
which
our
sweet
peaceful
friend
in
germany
is
so
fond
of
talking
about
but
it
will
spread
over
the
sky
i
tell
you
like
some
tropical
storm
france
is
unready
russia
is
unready
only
germany
and
her
marionette
austria
the
strings
of
which
she
pulls
is
go
on
prophesying
said
michael
i
wish
i
could
ever
since
that
sarajevo
murder
i
have
thought
of
nothing
else
day
and
night
but
how
events
will
develop
then
i
can
t
imagine
what
will
england
do
who
knows
i
only
know
what
germany
thinks
she
will
do
and
that
is
stand
aside
because
she
can
t
stir
with
this
irish
round
her
neck
if
germany
thought
otherwise
she
is
perfectly
capable
of
sending
a
dozen
submarines
over
to
our
naval
manoeuvres
and
torpedoing
our
battleships
right
and
michael
laughed
outright
at
this
while
a
fleet
of
zeppelins
hovers
over
london
and
drops
bombs
on
the
war
office
and
the
admiralty
he
suggested
but
aunt
barbara
was
not
in
the
least
diverted
by
this
and
if
england
stands
aside
she
said
der
tag
will
only
dawn
a
little
later
when
germany
has
settled
with
france
and
russia
we
shall
live
to
see
der
tag
michael
unless
we
are
run
over
by
and
pray
god
we
shall
see
it
soon
for
the
sooner
the
better
your
adorable
falbes
now
sylvia
and
hermann
what
do
they
think
of
it
hermann
was
certainly
rather
rather
upset
when
he
read
of
the
sarajevo
murders
he
said
but
he
pins
his
faith
on
the
german
emperor
whom
he
alluded
to
as
a
which
would
put
out
any
aunt
barbara
rose
in
violent
incredulity
pish
and
bosh
she
remarked
if
he
had
alluded
to
him
as
an
incendiary
bomb
there
would
have
been
more
sense
in
his
anyhow
he
and
sylvia
are
planning
a
musical
tour
in
germany
in
the
autumn
said
michael
it
s
a
long
long
way
to
tipperary
remarked
aunt
barbara
enigmatically
why
tipperary
asked
michael
oh
it
s
just
a
song
i
heard
at
a
the
other
night
there
s
a
jolly
catchy
tune
to
it
which
has
rung
in
my
head
ever
since
that
s
the
sort
of
music
i
like
something
you
can
carry
away
with
you
and
your
music
michael
rather
in
abeyance
there
are
other
things
to
think
aunt
barbara
got
up
ah
tell
me
more
about
them
she
said
i
want
to
get
this
nightmare
out
of
my
head
sylvia
now
sylvia
is
a
good
cure
for
the
nightmare
is
she
kind
as
she
is
fair
michael
michael
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
turned
a
quiet
radiant
face
to
her
i
can
t
talk
about
it
he
said
i
can
t
get
accustomed
to
the
wonder
of
that
will
do
that
s
a
completely
satisfactory
account
but
go
michael
laughed
how
can
i
he
asked
there
s
no
end
and
no
beginning
i
can
t
go
on
as
you
order
me
about
a
thing
like
that
there
is
sylvia
there
is
i
must
be
content
with
that
then
she
said
smiling
we
are
said
michael
lady
barbara
waited
a
moment
without
speaking
and
your
mother
she
asked
he
shook
his
head
she
still
refuses
to
see
me
he
said
she
still
thinks
it
was
i
who
made
the
plot
to
take
her
away
and
shut
her
up
she
is
often
angry
with
me
poor
darling
but
but
you
see
it
isn
t
she
who
is
angry
it
s
just
her
yes
my
dear
said
lady
barbara
i
am
so
glad
you
see
it
like
how
else
could
i
see
it
it
was
my
real
mother
whom
i
began
to
know
last
christmas
and
whom
i
was
with
in
town
for
the
three
months
that
followed
that
s
how
i
think
of
her
i
can
t
think
of
her
as
anything
and
how
is
she
otherwise
again
he
shook
his
head
she
is
wretched
though
they
say
that
all
she
feels
is
dim
and
veiled
that
we
mustn
t
think
of
her
as
actually
unhappy
sometimes
there
are
good
days
when
she
takes
a
certain
pleasure
in
her
walks
and
in
looking
after
a
little
plot
of
ground
where
she
gardens
and
thank
god
that
sudden
outburst
when
she
tried
to
kill
me
seems
to
have
entirely
passed
from
her
mind
they
don
t
think
she
remembers
it
at
all
but
then
the
good
days
are
rare
and
are
growing
rarer
and
often
now
she
sits
doing
nothing
at
all
but
aunt
barbara
laid
her
hand
on
him
oh
my
dear
she
said
michael
paused
for
a
moment
his
brown
eyes
shining
if
only
she
could
come
back
just
for
a
little
to
what
she
was
in
january
he
said
she
was
happier
then
i
think
than
she
ever
was
before
i
can
t
help
wondering
if
anyhow
i
could
have
prolonged
those
days
by
giving
myself
up
to
her
more
my
dear
you
needn
t
wonder
about
that
said
aunt
barbara
sir
james
told
me
that
it
was
your
love
and
nothing
else
at
all
that
gave
her
those
michael
s
lips
quivered
i
can
t
tell
you
what
they
were
to
me
he
said
for
she
and
i
found
each
other
then
and
we
both
felt
we
had
missed
each
other
so
much
and
so
long
she
was
happy
then
and
i
too
and
now
everything
has
been
taken
from
her
and
still
in
spite
of
that
my
cup
is
full
to
that
s
how
she
would
have
it
michael
said
barbara
yes
i
know
that
i
remind
myself
of
again
he
paused
they
don
t
think
she
will
live
very
long
he
said
she
is
getting
physically
much
weaker
but
during
this
last
week
or
two
she
has
been
less
unhappy
they
think
they
say
some
new
change
may
come
any
time
it
may
be
only
the
great
change
i
mean
her
death
but
it
is
possible
before
that
that
her
mind
will
clear
again
sir
james
told
me
that
occasionally
happened
like
like
a
ray
of
sunlight
after
a
stormy
day
it
would
be
good
if
that
happened
i
would
give
almost
anything
to
feel
that
she
and
i
were
together
again
as
we
barbara
childless
felt
something
of
motherhood
michael
s
simplicity
and
his
sincerity
were
already
known
to
her
but
she
had
never
yet
known
the
strength
of
him
you
could
lean
on
michael
in
his
quiet
undemonstrative
way
he
supported
you
completely
as
a
son
should
there
was
no
possibility
of
insecurity
god
bless
you
my
dear
she
said
chapter
xiii
one
close
thundery
morning
about
a
week
later
michael
was
sitting
at
his
piano
in
his
shirtsleeves
busy
practising
he
was
aware
that
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
the
telephone
was
calling
for
him
but
it
seemed
to
be
of
far
greater
importance
at
the
minute
to
finish
the
last
page
of
one
of
the
bach
fugues
than
to
attend
to
what
anybody
else
might
have
to
say
to
him
then
it
suddenly
flashed
across
him
that
it
might
be
sylvia
who
wanted
to
speak
to
him
or
that
there
might
be
news
about
his
mother
and
his
fingers
leaped
from
the
piano
in
the
middle
of
a
bar
and
he
ran
and
slid
across
the
parquet
floor
but
it
was
neither
of
these
and
compared
to
them
it
was
a
case
of
only
hermann
who
wanted
to
see
him
but
hermann
it
appeared
wanted
to
see
him
urgently
and
if
he
was
in
which
he
was
would
be
with
him
in
ten
minutes
but
the
bach
thread
was
broken
and
michael
since
it
was
not
worth
while
trying
to
mend
it
for
the
sake
of
these
few
minutes
sat
down
by
the
open
window
and
idly
took
up
the
morning
paper
which
as
yet
he
had
not
opened
since
he
had
hurried
over
breakfast
in
order
to
get
to
his
piano
the
music
announcements
on
the
outside
page
first
detained
him
and
seeing
that
the
concert
by
the
falbes
which
was
to
take
place
in
five
or
six
days
was
advertised
he
wondered
vaguely
whether
it
was
about
that
that
hermann
wanted
to
see
him
and
if
so
why
he
could
not
have
said
whatever
he
had
to
say
on
the
telephone
instead
of
cutting
things
short
with
the
curt
statement
that
he
wished
to
see
him
urgently
and
would
come
round
at
once
then
remembering
that
francis
had
been
playing
cricket
for
the
guards
yesterday
he
turned
briskly
over
to
the
last
page
of
sporting
news
and
found
that
his
cousin
had
distinguished
himself
by
making
no
runs
at
all
but
by
missing
two
expensive
catches
in
the
deep
field
from
there
after
a
slight
inspection
of
a
couple
of
advertisement
columns
he
worked
back
to
the
middle
leaf
where
were
leaders
and
the
news
of
nations
and
the
movements
of
kings
all
this
last
week
he
had
scanned
such
items
with
a
growing
sense
of
amusement
in
the
recollection
of
hermann
s
disquiet
over
the
sarajevo
murders
and
aunt
barbara
s
more
detailed
and
vivid
prognostications
of
coming
danger
for
nothing
more
had
happened
and
he
supposed
vaguely
only
since
the
affair
had
begun
to
fade
from
his
mind
that
austria
had
made
inquiries
and
that
since
she
was
satisfied
there
was
no
public
pronouncement
to
be
made
the
hot
breeze
from
the
window
made
the
paper
a
little
unmanageable
for
a
moment
but
presently
he
got
it
satisfactorily
folded
and
a
big
black
headline
met
his
eye
a
below
it
contained
the
demands
which
austria
had
made
in
the
note
addressed
to
the
servian
government
a
glance
was
sufficient
to
show
that
they
were
framed
in
the
most
truculent
and
threatening
manner
possible
to
imagine
they
were
not
the
reasonable
proposals
that
one
state
had
a
perfect
right
to
make
of
another
on
whose
soil
and
with
the
connivance
of
whose
subjects
the
murders
had
been
committed
they
were
a
piece
of
arbitrary
dictation
a
threat
levelled
against
a
dependent
and
an
inferior
michael
had
read
them
through
twice
with
a
growing
sense
of
uneasiness
at
the
thought
of
how
lady
barbara
s
first
anticipations
had
been
fulfilled
when
hermann
came
in
he
pointed
to
the
paper
michael
held
ah
you
have
seen
it
he
said
perhaps
you
can
guess
what
i
wanted
to
see
you
connected
with
the
austrian
note
asked
michael
i
have
not
the
vaguest
hermann
sat
down
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
mike
i
m
going
back
to
germany
he
said
now
do
you
understand
i
m
you
mean
that
germany
is
at
the
back
of
this
it
is
obvious
isn
t
it
those
demands
couldn
t
have
been
made
without
the
consent
of
austria
s
ally
and
they
won
t
be
granted
servia
will
appeal
to
russia
and
and
then
god
knows
what
may
happen
in
the
event
of
that
happening
i
must
be
in
my
fatherland
ready
to
serve
if
you
mean
you
think
it
possible
you
will
go
to
war
with
russia
asked
michael
yes
i
think
it
possible
and
if
i
am
right
if
there
is
that
possibility
i
can
t
be
away
from
my
but
the
emperor
the
whom
you
said
would
quench
any
conflagration
he
is
away
yachting
he
went
off
after
the
visit
of
the
british
fleet
to
kiel
who
knows
whether
before
he
gets
back
things
may
have
gone
too
far
can
t
you
see
that
i
must
go
wouldn
t
you
go
if
you
were
me
suppose
you
were
in
germany
now
wouldn
t
you
hurry
home
michael
was
silent
and
hermann
spoke
again
and
if
there
is
trouble
with
russia
france
i
take
it
is
bound
to
join
her
and
if
france
joins
her
what
will
england
do
the
great
shadow
of
the
approaching
storm
fell
over
michael
even
as
outside
the
sultry
stillness
of
the
morning
grew
darker
ah
you
think
that
asked
michael
hermann
put
his
hand
on
michael
s
shoulder
mike
you
re
the
best
friend
i
have
he
said
and
soon
please
god
you
are
going
to
marry
the
girl
who
is
everything
else
in
the
world
to
me
you
two
make
up
my
world
really
you
two
and
my
mother
anyhow
no
other
individual
counts
or
is
in
the
same
class
you
know
that
i
expect
but
there
is
one
other
thing
and
that
s
my
nationality
it
counts
first
nothing
nobody
not
even
sylvia
or
my
mother
or
you
can
stand
between
me
and
that
i
expect
you
know
that
also
for
you
saw
nearly
a
year
ago
what
germany
is
to
me
perhaps
i
may
be
quite
wrong
about
it
all
about
the
gravity
i
mean
of
the
situation
and
perhaps
in
a
few
days
i
may
come
racing
home
again
yes
i
said
home
didn
t
i
well
that
shows
you
just
how
i
am
torn
in
two
but
i
can
t
help
hermann
s
hand
remained
on
his
shoulder
gently
patting
it
to
michael
the
world
life
the
whole
spirit
of
things
had
suddenly
grown
sinister
of
the
quality
of
nightmare
it
was
true
that
all
the
ground
of
this
ominous
depression
which
had
darkened
round
him
was
conjectural
and
speculative
that
diplomacy
backed
by
the
horror
of
war
which
surely
all
civilised
nations
and
responsible
govermnents
must
share
had
so
far
from
saying
its
last
not
yet
said
its
first
word
that
the
wits
of
all
the
cabinets
of
europe
were
at
this
moment
only
just
beginning
to
stir
themselves
so
as
to
secure
a
peaceful
solution
but
in
spite
of
this
the
darkness
and
the
nightmare
grew
in
intensity
but
as
to
hermann
s
determination
to
go
to
germany
which
made
this
so
terribly
real
since
it
was
beginning
to
enter
into
practical
everyday
life
he
had
neither
means
nor
indeed
desire
to
combat
it
he
saw
perfectly
clearly
that
hermann
must
go
i
don
t
want
to
dissuade
you
he
said
not
only
because
it
would
be
useless
but
because
i
am
with
you
you
couldn
t
do
otherwise
i
don
t
see
that
i
could
sylvia
agrees
a
terrible
conjecture
flashed
through
michael
s
mind
and
she
he
asked
she
can
t
leave
my
mother
of
course
said
hermann
and
after
all
i
may
be
on
a
wild
goose
chase
but
i
can
t
risk
being
unable
to
get
to
germany
if
if
the
worst
the
ghost
of
a
smile
played
round
his
mouth
for
a
moment
and
i
m
not
sure
that
she
could
leave
you
mike
he
added
somehow
this
though
it
gave
michael
a
moment
of
intensest
relief
to
know
that
sylvia
remained
made
the
shadow
grow
deeper
accentuated
the
lines
of
the
storm
which
had
begun
to
spread
over
the
sky
he
began
to
see
as
nightmare
no
longer
but
as
stern
and
possible
realities
something
of
the
unutterable
woe
the
divisions
the
which
menaced
hermann
what
do
you
think
will
happen
he
said
it
is
incredible
unfaceable
the
gentle
patting
on
his
shoulder
that
suddenly
and
poignantly
reminded
him
of
when
sylvia
s
hand
was
there
ceased
for
a
moment
and
then
was
resumed
mike
old
boy
said
hermann
we
ve
got
to
face
the
unfaceable
and
believe
that
the
incredible
is
possible
i
may
be
all
wrong
about
it
and
as
i
say
in
a
few
days
time
i
may
come
racing
back
but
on
the
other
hand
this
may
be
our
last
talk
together
for
i
go
off
this
afternoon
so
let
s
face
he
paused
a
moment
it
may
be
that
before
long
i
shall
be
fighting
for
my
fatherland
he
said
and
if
there
is
to
be
fighting
it
may
be
that
germany
will
before
long
be
fighting
england
there
i
shall
be
on
one
side
and
since
naturally
you
will
go
back
into
the
guards
you
will
be
fighting
on
the
other
i
shall
be
doing
my
best
to
kill
englishmen
whom
i
love
and
they
will
be
doing
their
best
to
kill
me
and
those
of
my
blood
there
s
the
horror
of
it
and
it
s
that
we
must
face
if
we
met
in
a
bayonet
charge
mike
i
should
have
to
do
my
best
to
run
you
through
and
yet
i
shouldn
t
love
you
one
bit
the
less
and
you
must
know
that
or
if
you
ran
me
through
i
shall
have
to
die
loving
you
just
the
same
as
before
and
hoping
you
would
live
happy
for
ever
and
ever
as
the
say
with
hermann
don
t
go
said
michael
suddenly
mike
you
didn
t
mean
that
he
said
michael
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
in
silence
no
it
is
unsaid
he
replied
hermann
looked
round
as
the
clock
on
the
chimed
i
must
be
going
he
said
i
needn
t
say
anything
to
you
about
sylvia
because
all
i
could
say
is
in
your
heart
already
well
we
ve
met
in
this
jolly
world
mike
and
we
ve
been
great
friends
neither
you
nor
i
could
find
a
greater
friend
than
we
ve
been
to
each
other
i
bless
god
for
this
last
year
it
s
been
the
happiest
in
my
life
now
what
else
is
there
your
music
don
t
ever
be
lazy
about
your
music
it
s
worth
while
taking
all
the
pains
you
can
about
it
lord
do
you
remember
the
evening
when
i
first
tried
your
variations
let
me
play
the
last
one
now
i
want
something
jubilant
let
s
see
how
does
it
go
he
held
his
hands
those
long
hands
poised
for
a
moment
above
the
keys
then
plunged
into
the
glorious
riot
of
the
full
chords
and
scales
till
the
room
rang
with
it
the
last
chord
he
held
for
a
moment
and
then
sprang
up
ah
that
s
good
he
said
and
now
i
m
going
to
say
and
go
without
looking
but
might
i
see
you
off
this
afternoon
asked
michael
no
please
don
t
station
partings
are
fussy
and
disagreeable
i
want
to
say
to
you
here
in
your
quiet
room
just
as
i
shall
say
goodbye
to
sylvia
at
home
ah
mike
yes
both
hands
and
smiling
may
god
give
us
other
meetings
and
talks
and
companionship
and
years
of
love
my
best
of
friends
then
as
he
had
said
he
walked
to
the
door
without
looking
round
and
next
moment
it
had
closed
behind
him
throughout
the
next
week
the
tension
of
the
situation
grew
ever
greater
strained
towards
the
while
the
little
cloud
the
man
s
hand
which
had
arisen
above
the
eastern
horizon
grew
and
overspread
the
heavens
in
a
pall
that
became
ever
more
black
and
threatening
for
a
few
days
yet
it
seemed
that
perhaps
even
now
the
cataclysm
might
be
averted
but
gradually
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
diplomacy
to
loosen
the
knot
it
became
clear
that
the
ends
of
the
cord
were
held
in
hands
that
did
not
mean
to
release
their
hold
till
it
was
pulled
tight
servia
yielded
to
such
demands
as
it
was
possible
for
her
to
grant
as
an
independent
state
but
the
inflexible
fingers
never
abated
one
jot
of
their
strangling
pressure
she
appealed
to
russia
and
russia
s
remonstrance
fell
on
deaf
ears
or
rather
on
ears
that
had
determined
not
to
hear
from
london
and
paris
came
proposals
for
conference
for
arbitration
with
welcome
for
any
suggestion
from
the
other
side
which
might
lead
to
a
peaceful
solution
of
the
disputed
demands
already
recognised
by
europe
as
a
firebrand
wantonly
flung
into
the
midst
of
dangerous
and
inflammable
material
over
that
burning
firebrand
preventing
and
warding
off
all
the
eager
hands
that
were
stretched
to
put
it
out
stood
the
figure
of
the
nation
at
whose
bidding
it
had
been
flung
there
gradually
out
of
the
and
gathering
darkness
vaguely
at
first
and
then
in
definite
and
menacing
outline
emerged
the
inexorable
face
of
germany
whose
figure
was
clad
in
the
shining
armour
so
well
known
in
the
flamboyant
utterances
of
her
war
lord
which
had
been
treated
hitherto
as
mere
irresponsible
utterances
to
be
greeted
with
a
laugh
and
a
shrugged
shoulder
deep
and
patient
she
had
always
been
and
now
she
believed
that
the
time
had
come
for
her
patience
to
do
its
perfect
work
she
had
bided
long
for
the
time
when
she
could
best
fling
that
lighted
brand
into
the
midst
of
civilisation
and
she
believed
she
had
calculated
well
she
cared
nothing
for
servia
nor
for
her
ally
on
both
her
frontiers
she
was
ready
and
now
on
the
east
she
heeded
not
the
remonstrance
of
russia
nor
her
sincere
and
cordial
invitation
to
friendly
discussion
she
but
waited
for
the
step
that
she
had
made
inevitable
and
on
the
first
sign
of
russian
mobilisation
she
with
her
mobilisation
ready
to
be
completed
in
a
few
days
peremptorily
demanded
that
it
should
cease
on
the
western
frontier
behind
the
rhine
she
was
ready
also
her
armies
were
prepared
cannon
fodder
in
uncountable
store
of
shells
and
cartridges
was
prepared
and
in
endless
battalions
of
men
waiting
to
be
discharged
in
one
rush
to
overrun
france
and
holding
the
french
armies
shattered
and
dispersed
with
a
mere
handful
of
her
troops
to
hurl
the
rest
at
russia
the
whole
campaign
was
mathematically
thought
out
in
a
few
months
at
the
outside
france
would
be
lying
trampled
down
and
bleeding
russia
would
be
overrun
already
she
would
be
mistress
of
europe
and
prepared
to
attack
the
only
country
that
stood
between
her
and
dominion
whose
allies
she
would
already
have
reduced
to
impotence
here
she
staked
on
an
uncertainty
she
could
not
absolutely
tell
what
england
s
attitude
would
be
but
she
had
the
strongest
reason
for
hoping
that
distracted
by
the
imminence
of
civil
strife
she
would
be
unable
to
come
to
the
help
of
her
allies
until
the
allies
were
past
helping
for
a
moment
only
were
seen
those
set
stern
features
mad
for
war
then
with
a
snap
germany
shut
down
her
visor
and
stood
with
sword
unsheathed
waiting
for
the
horror
of
the
stupendous
bloodshed
which
she
had
made
inevitable
her
legions
gathered
on
the
eastern
front
threatening
war
on
russia
and
thus
pulling
france
into
the
spreading
conflagration
and
into
the
midst
of
the
flame
she
stood
ready
to
cast
the
fragments
of
the
treaty
that
bound
her
to
respect
the
neutrality
of
belgium
all
this
week
while
the
flames
of
the
flung
began
to
spread
the
english
public
waited
incredulous
of
the
inevitable
michael
among
them
found
himself
unable
to
believe
even
then
that
the
bugles
were
already
sounding
and
that
the
piles
of
shells
in
their
were
being
loaded
on
to
the
military
ammunition
trains
but
all
the
ordinary
interests
in
life
all
the
things
that
busily
and
contentedly
occupied
his
day
one
only
excepted
had
become
without
savour
a
dozen
times
in
the
morning
he
would
sit
down
to
his
piano
only
to
find
that
he
could
not
think
it
worth
while
to
make
his
hands
produce
these
meaningless
tinkling
sounds
and
he
would
jump
up
to
read
the
paper
over
again
or
watch
for
fresh
headlines
to
appear
on
the
boards
of
in
the
street
and
send
out
for
any
fresh
edition
or
he
would
walk
round
to
his
club
and
spend
an
hour
reading
the
tape
news
and
waiting
for
fresh
slips
to
be
pinned
up
but
through
all
the
nightmare
of
suspense
and
hope
sylvia
remained
real
and
after
he
had
received
his
daily
report
from
the
establishment
where
his
mother
was
with
the
invariable
message
that
there
was
no
marked
change
of
any
kind
and
that
it
was
useless
for
him
to
think
of
coming
to
see
her
he
would
go
off
to
maidstone
crescent
and
spend
the
greater
part
of
the
day
with
the
girl
once
during
this
week
he
had
received
a
note
from
hermann
written
at
munich
and
on
the
same
day
she
also
had
heard
from
him
he
had
gone
back
to
his
regiment
which
was
mobilised
as
a
private
and
was
very
busy
with
drill
and
duties
feeling
in
germany
he
said
was
elated
and
triumphant
it
was
considered
certain
that
england
would
stand
aside
as
the
quarrel
was
none
of
hers
and
the
nation
generally
looked
forward
to
a
short
and
brilliant
campaign
with
the
occupation
of
paris
to
be
made
in
september
at
the
latest
but
as
a
postscript
in
his
note
to
sylvia
he
had
added
you
don
t
think
there
is
the
faintest
chance
of
england
coming
in
do
you
please
write
to
me
fully
and
get
mike
to
write
i
have
heard
from
neither
of
you
and
as
i
am
sure
you
must
have
written
i
conclude
that
letters
are
stopped
i
went
to
the
theatre
last
night
there
was
a
tremendous
scene
of
patriotism
the
people
are
since
then
nothing
had
been
heard
from
him
and
as
michael
drove
down
to
see
sylvia
he
saw
on
the
that
belgium
had
appealed
to
england
against
the
violation
of
her
territory
by
the
german
armies
en
route
for
france
overtures
had
been
made
asking
for
leave
to
pass
through
the
neutral
territory
these
belgium
had
rejected
this
was
given
as
official
news
there
came
also
the
report
that
the
belgian
remonstrances
would
be
disregarded
should
she
refuse
passage
to
the
german
battalions
that
could
make
no
difference
since
it
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
to
invade
france
by
that
route
sylvia
was
out
in
the
garden
where
hardly
a
month
ago
they
had
spent
that
evening
of
silent
peace
and
she
got
up
quickly
as
michael
came
out
ah
my
dear
she
said
i
am
glad
you
have
come
i
have
got
the
horrors
you
saw
the
latest
news
yes
and
have
you
heard
again
from
hermann
no
i
have
not
had
a
he
kissed
her
and
sat
down
no
i
have
not
heard
either
he
said
i
expect
he
is
right
letters
have
been
and
what
do
you
think
will
be
the
result
of
belgium
s
appeal
she
asked
who
can
tell
the
prime
minister
is
going
to
make
a
statement
on
monday
there
have
been
cabinet
meetings
going
on
all
she
looked
at
him
in
silence
and
what
do
you
think
she
asked
quite
suddenly
at
her
question
michael
found
himself
facing
it
even
as
when
the
final
catastrophe
was
more
remote
he
had
faced
it
with
falbe
all
this
week
he
knew
he
had
been
looking
away
from
it
telling
himself
that
it
was
incredible
now
he
discovered
that
the
one
thing
he
dreaded
more
than
that
england
should
go
to
war
was
that
she
should
not
the
consciousness
of
national
honour
the
thing
which
with
religion
englishmen
are
most
shy
of
speaking
about
suddenly
asserted
itself
and
he
found
on
the
moment
that
it
was
bigger
than
anything
else
in
the
world
i
think
we
shall
go
to
war
he
said
i
don
t
see
personally
how
we
can
exist
any
more
as
a
nation
if
we
don
t
we
we
shall
be
damned
if
we
don
t
damned
for
ever
and
ever
it
s
moral
extinction
not
she
kindled
at
that
yes
i
know
she
said
that
s
what
i
have
been
telling
myself
but
oh
mike
there
s
some
dreadful
cowardly
part
of
me
that
won
t
listen
when
i
think
of
hermann
and
she
broke
off
a
moment
michael
she
said
what
will
you
do
if
there
is
war
he
took
up
her
hand
that
lay
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
my
darling
how
can
you
ask
he
said
of
course
i
shall
go
back
to
the
for
one
moment
she
gave
way
no
no
she
said
you
mustn
t
do
and
then
suddenly
she
stopped
my
dear
i
ask
your
pardon
she
said
of
course
you
will
i
know
that
really
it
s
only
this
stupid
cowardly
part
of
me
that
that
interrupted
i
am
ashamed
of
it
i
m
not
as
bad
as
that
all
through
i
don
t
make
excuses
for
myself
but
ah
mike
when
i
think
of
what
germany
is
to
me
and
what
hermann
is
and
when
i
think
what
england
is
to
me
and
what
you
are
it
shan
t
appear
again
or
if
it
does
you
will
make
allowance
won
t
you
at
least
i
can
agree
with
you
utterly
utterly
it
s
the
flesh
that
s
weak
or
rather
that
is
so
strong
but
i
ve
got
it
she
sat
there
in
silence
a
little
mopping
her
eyes
how
i
hate
girls
who
cry
she
said
it
is
so
dreadfully
feeble
look
mike
there
are
some
roses
on
that
tree
from
which
i
plucked
the
one
you
didn
t
think
much
of
do
you
remember
you
crushed
it
up
in
my
hand
and
made
it
he
smiled
i
have
got
some
faint
recollection
of
it
he
said
sylvia
had
got
hold
of
her
courage
again
have
you
she
asked
what
a
wonderful
memory
and
that
quiet
evening
out
here
next
day
perhaps
you
remember
that
too
that
was
real
that
was
a
possession
that
we
shan
t
ever
part
she
pointed
with
her
finger
you
and
i
sat
there
and
hermann
there
she
said
and
mother
sat
why
there
she
is
mother
darling
let
s
have
tea
out
here
shall
we
i
will
go
and
tell
falbe
had
drifted
out
in
her
usual
thistledown
style
and
shook
hands
with
michael
what
an
upset
it
all
is
she
said
with
all
these
dreadful
rumours
going
about
that
we
shall
be
at
war
i
fell
asleep
i
think
a
little
after
lunch
when
i
could
not
attend
to
my
book
for
thinking
about
isn
t
the
book
interesting
asked
michael
no
not
very
it
is
rather
painful
i
do
not
know
why
people
write
about
painful
things
when
there
are
so
many
pleasant
and
interesting
things
to
write
about
it
seems
to
me
very
michael
heard
something
cried
in
the
streets
and
at
the
same
moment
he
heard
sylvia
s
step
quickly
crossing
the
studio
to
the
side
door
that
opened
on
to
it
in
a
minute
she
returned
with
a
fresh
edition
of
an
evening
paper
they
are
preparing
to
cross
the
rhine
she
said
falbe
gave
a
little
sigh
i
don
t
know
i
am
sure
she
said
what
you
are
in
such
a
state
about
sylvia
of
course
the
germans
want
to
get
into
france
the
easiest
and
quickest
way
at
least
i
m
sure
i
should
it
is
very
foolish
of
belgium
not
to
give
them
leave
as
they
are
so
much
the
mother
darling
you
don
t
understand
one
syllable
about
it
said
sylvia
very
likely
not
dear
but
i
am
very
glad
we
are
an
island
and
that
nobody
can
come
marching
here
but
it
is
all
a
dreadful
upset
lord
i
mean
michael
what
with
hermann
in
germany
and
the
concert
tour
abandoned
still
if
everything
is
quiet
again
by
the
middle
of
october
as
i
daresay
it
will
be
it
might
come
off
after
all
he
will
be
on
the
spot
and
you
and
michael
can
join
him
though
i
m
not
quite
sure
if
that
would
be
proper
but
we
might
arrange
something
he
might
meet
you
at
i
m
afraid
it
doesn
t
look
very
likely
remarked
michael
mildly
oh
and
are
you
pessimistic
too
like
sylvia
pray
don
t
be
pessimistic
there
is
a
dreadful
pessimist
in
my
book
who
always
thinks
the
worst
is
going
to
and
does
it
asked
michael
as
far
as
i
have
got
it
does
which
makes
it
all
the
worse
of
course
i
am
very
anxious
about
hermann
but
i
feel
sure
he
will
come
back
safe
to
us
i
daresay
france
will
give
in
when
she
sees
germany
is
in
falbe
pulled
the
shattered
remnants
of
her
mind
together
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
knew
she
did
not
care
one
atom
what
might
happen
to
armies
and
navies
and
nations
provided
only
that
she
had
a
quantity
of
novels
to
read
and
meals
at
regular
hours
the
fact
of
being
on
an
island
was
an
immense
consolation
to
her
since
it
was
quite
certain
that
whatever
happened
german
armies
or
french
or
soudanese
for
that
matter
could
not
march
here
and
enter
her
and
take
her
books
away
from
her
for
years
past
she
had
asked
nothing
more
of
the
world
than
that
she
should
be
comfortable
in
it
and
it
really
seemed
not
an
unreasonable
request
considering
at
how
small
an
outlay
of
money
all
the
comfort
she
wanted
could
be
secured
to
her
the
thought
of
war
had
upset
her
a
good
deal
already
she
had
been
unable
to
attend
to
her
book
when
she
awoke
from
her
nap
and
now
when
she
hoped
to
have
her
tea
in
peace
and
find
her
attention
restored
by
it
she
found
the
general
atmosphere
of
her
two
companions
vaguely
disquieting
she
became
a
little
more
loquacious
than
usual
with
the
idea
of
talking
herself
back
into
a
tranquil
frame
of
mind
and
reassuring
to
herself
the
promise
of
a
peaceful
future
such
a
blessing
we
have
a
good
fleet
she
said
that
will
make
us
safe
won
t
it
i
declare
i
almost
hate
the
germans
though
my
dear
husband
was
one
himself
for
making
such
a
disturbance
the
papers
all
say
it
is
germany
s
fault
so
i
suppose
it
must
be
the
papers
know
better
than
anybody
don
t
they
because
they
have
foreign
correspondents
that
must
be
a
great
expense
sylvia
felt
she
could
not
endure
this
any
longer
it
was
like
having
a
raw
wound
stroked
mother
you
don
t
understand
she
said
you
don
t
appreciate
what
is
happening
in
a
day
or
two
england
will
be
at
war
with
falbe
s
book
had
slipped
from
her
knee
she
picked
it
up
and
flapped
the
cover
once
or
twice
to
get
rid
of
dust
that
might
have
settled
there
but
what
then
she
said
it
is
very
dreadful
no
doubt
to
think
of
dear
hermann
being
with
the
german
army
but
we
are
getting
used
to
that
are
we
not
besides
he
told
me
it
was
his
duty
to
go
i
do
not
think
for
a
moment
that
france
will
be
able
to
stand
against
germany
germany
will
be
in
paris
in
no
time
and
i
daresay
hermann
s
next
letter
will
be
to
say
that
he
has
been
walking
down
the
boulevards
of
course
war
is
very
dreadful
i
know
that
and
then
germany
will
be
at
war
with
russia
too
but
she
will
have
austria
to
help
her
and
as
for
germany
being
at
war
with
england
that
does
not
make
me
nervous
think
of
our
fleet
and
how
safe
we
feel
with
that
i
see
that
we
have
twice
as
many
boats
as
the
germans
with
two
to
one
we
must
win
and
they
won
t
be
able
to
send
any
of
their
armies
here
i
feel
quite
comfortable
again
now
that
i
have
talked
it
sylvia
caught
michael
s
eye
for
a
moment
over
the
she
felt
he
acquiesced
in
what
she
was
intending
to
say
that
is
good
then
she
said
i
am
glad
you
feel
comfortable
about
it
mother
dear
now
will
you
read
your
book
out
here
why
not
if
i
fetch
you
a
shawl
in
case
you
feel
cold
falbe
turned
a
questioning
eye
to
the
motionless
trees
and
the
unclouded
sky
i
don
t
think
i
shall
even
want
a
shawl
dear
she
said
listen
how
the
newsboys
are
calling
is
it
something
fresh
do
you
think
a
moment
s
listening
attention
was
sufficient
to
make
it
known
that
the
news
shouted
outside
was
concerned
only
with
the
result
of
a
county
cricket
match
and
michael
as
well
as
sylvia
was
conscious
of
a
certain
relief
to
know
that
at
the
immediate
present
there
was
no
fresh
clang
of
the
bell
that
was
beating
out
the
seconds
of
peace
that
still
remained
just
for
now
for
this
hour
on
saturday
afternoon
there
was
a
respite
no
new
link
was
forged
in
the
intolerable
sequence
of
events
but
even
as
he
drew
breath
in
that
knowledge
there
came
the
in
the
sense
that
those
whose
business
it
was
to
disseminate
the
news
that
would
cause
their
papers
to
sell
had
just
a
cricket
match
to
advertise
their
wares
now
when
the
country
and
when
europe
were
on
the
brink
of
a
bloodier
war
than
all
the
annals
of
history
contained
they
who
presumably
knew
what
the
public
desired
to
be
informed
on
thought
that
the
news
which
would
sell
best
was
that
concerned
with
wooden
bats
and
leather
balls
and
strong
young
men
in
flannels
michael
had
heard
with
a
sort
of
tender
incredulity
falbe
s
optimistic
reflections
and
had
been
more
than
content
to
let
her
rest
secure
in
them
but
was
the
country
the
heart
of
england
like
her
did
it
care
more
for
cricket
matches
as
she
for
her
book
than
for
the
maintenance
of
the
nation
s
honour
whatever
that
championship
might
cost
and
the
cry
went
on
past
the
fine
innings
by
horsfield
result
of
the
oval
match
and
yet
he
had
just
had
his
tea
as
usual
and
eaten
a
slice
of
cake
and
was
now
smoking
a
cigarette
it
was
natural
to
do
that
not
to
make
a
fuss
and
refuse
food
and
drink
and
it
was
natural
that
people
should
still
be
interested
in
cricket
and
at
the
moment
his
attitude
towards
falbe
changed
instead
of
pity
and
irritation
at
her
normality
he
was
suddenly
taken
with
a
sense
of
gratitude
to
her
it
was
restful
to
suspense
and
jangled
nerves
to
see
someone
who
went
on
as
usual
the
sun
shone
the
leaves
of
the
did
not
wither
falbe
read
her
book
the
evening
paper
was
full
of
cricket
news
and
then
the
reaction
from
that
seized
him
again
supposing
all
the
nation
was
like
that
supposing
nobody
cared
and
the
tension
of
suspense
strained
more
tightly
than
ever
for
the
next
hours
while
day
and
night
the
telegraph
wires
of
europe
tingled
with
momentous
questions
and
grave
replies
while
ministers
and
ambassadors
met
and
parted
and
met
again
rumours
flew
this
way
and
that
like
flocks
of
driven
backwards
and
forwards
settling
for
a
moment
with
a
stir
and
splash
and
then
with
rush
of
wings
speeding
back
and
on
again
a
huge
coal
strike
in
the
northern
counties
fostered
and
financed
by
german
gold
was
supposed
to
be
imminent
and
this
would
put
out
of
the
country
s
power
the
ability
to
interfere
the
irish
home
rule
party
under
the
same
suasion
was
said
to
have
refused
to
call
a
truce
a
letter
had
been
received
in
high
quarters
from
the
german
emperor
avowing
his
fixed
determination
to
preserve
peace
and
this
was
honey
to
lord
ashbridge
then
in
turn
each
of
these
was
contradicted
all
thought
of
the
coal
strike
in
this
crisis
of
national
affairs
was
abandoned
the
irish
party
as
well
as
the
conservatives
were
of
one
mind
in
backing
up
the
government
no
matter
what
postponement
of
questions
that
were
vital
a
month
ago
their
cohesion
entailed
the
emperor
had
written
no
letter
at
all
but
through
the
nebulous
mists
of
hearsay
there
fell
solid
the
first
drops
of
the
imminent
storm
even
before
michael
had
left
sylvia
that
afternoon
germany
had
declared
war
on
russia
on
sunday
belgium
received
a
note
from
berlin
definitely
stating
that
should
their
government
not
grant
the
passage
to
the
german
battalions
a
way
should
be
forced
for
them
on
monday
finally
germany
declared
war
on
france
also
the
country
held
its
breath
in
suspense
at
what
the
decision
of
the
government
which
should
be
announced
that
afternoon
should
be
one
fact
only
was
publicly
known
and
that
was
that
the
english
fleet
only
lately
dismissed
from
its
manoeuvres
and
naval
review
had
vanished
there
were
guard
ships
old
cruisers
and
what
not
at
certain
ports
roamed
the
horizons
of
deal
and
portsmouth
but
the
great
fleet
the
swift
forts
of
had
gone
disappearing
no
one
knew
where
into
the
fine
weather
haze
that
brooded
over
the
midsummer
sea
there
perhaps
was
an
indication
of
what
the
decision
would
be
yet
there
was
no
certainty
at
home
there
was
official
silence
and
from
abroad
apart
from
the
three
vital
facts
came
but
the
quacking
of
rumour
report
after
report
each
contradicting
the
other
then
suddenly
came
certainty
a
rainbow
set
in
the
intolerable
cloud
on
monday
afternoon
when
the
house
of
commons
met
all
parties
were
known
to
have
sunk
their
private
differences
and
to
be
agreed
on
one
point
that
should
take
precedence
of
all
other
questions
germany
should
not
with
england
s
consent
violate
the
neutrality
of
belgium
as
far
as
england
was
concerned
all
negotiations
were
at
an
end
diplomacy
had
said
its
last
word
and
germany
was
given
hours
in
which
to
reply
should
a
satisfactory
answer
not
be
forthcoming
england
would
uphold
the
neutrality
she
with
others
had
sworn
to
respect
by
force
of
arms
and
at
that
one
immense
sigh
of
relief
went
up
from
the
whole
country
whatever
now
might
happen
in
whatever
horrors
of
and
bloody
war
the
nation
might
be
involved
the
nightmare
of
possible
neutrality
of
england
s
repudiating
the
debt
of
honour
was
removed
the
one
thing
worse
than
war
need
no
longer
be
dreaded
and
for
the
moment
the
future
hideous
and
though
it
would
surely
be
smiled
like
a
land
of
promise
michael
woke
on
the
morning
of
tuesday
the
fourth
of
august
with
the
feeling
of
something
having
suddenly
roused
him
and
in
a
few
seconds
he
knew
that
this
was
so
for
the
telephone
bell
in
the
room
next
door
sent
out
another
summons
he
got
straight
out
of
bed
and
went
to
it
with
a
hundred
vague
shadows
of
expectation
crossing
his
mind
then
he
learned
that
his
mother
was
gravely
ill
and
that
he
was
wanted
at
once
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
he
was
on
his
way
driving
swiftly
through
the
serene
warmth
of
the
early
morning
to
the
private
asylum
where
she
had
been
removed
after
her
sudden
homicidal
outburst
in
march
chapter
xiv
michael
was
sitting
that
same
afternoon
by
his
mother
s
bedside
he
had
learned
the
little
there
was
to
be
told
him
on
his
arrival
in
the
morning
how
that
half
an
hour
before
he
had
been
summoned
she
had
had
an
attack
of
heart
failure
and
since
then
after
recovering
from
the
acute
and
immediate
danger
she
had
lain
there
all
day
with
closed
eyes
in
a
state
of
but
exhaustion
once
or
twice
only
and
that
but
for
a
moment
she
had
shown
signs
of
increasing
vitality
and
then
sank
back
into
this
stupor
again
but
in
those
rare
short
intervals
she
had
opened
her
eyes
and
had
seemed
to
see
and
recognise
him
and
michael
thought
that
once
she
had
smiled
at
him
but
at
present
she
had
spoken
no
word
all
the
morning
lord
ashbridge
had
waited
there
too
but
since
there
was
no
change
he
had
gone
away
saying
that
he
would
return
again
later
and
asking
to
be
telephoned
for
if
his
wife
regained
consciousness
so
but
for
the
nurse
and
the
occasional
visits
of
the
doctor
michael
was
alone
with
his
mother
in
this
long
period
of
inactive
waiting
when
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
michael
did
not
seem
to
himself
to
be
feeling
very
vividly
and
but
for
one
desire
namely
that
before
the
end
his
mother
would
come
back
to
him
even
if
only
for
a
moment
his
mind
felt
drugged
and
stupefied
sometimes
for
a
little
it
would
sluggishly
turn
over
thoughts
about
his
father
wondering
with
a
sort
of
blunt
remote
contempt
how
it
was
possible
for
him
not
to
be
here
too
but
except
for
the
one
great
longing
that
his
mother
should
cleave
to
him
once
more
in
conscious
mind
he
observed
rather
than
felt
the
thought
of
sylvia
even
was
dim
he
knew
that
she
was
somewhere
in
the
world
but
she
had
become
for
the
present
like
some
picture
painted
in
his
mind
without
reality
dim
too
was
the
tension
of
those
last
days
somewhere
in
europe
was
a
country
called
germany
where
was
his
best
friend
drilling
in
the
ranks
to
which
he
had
returned
or
perhaps
already
on
his
way
to
bloodier
battlefields
than
the
world
had
ever
dreamed
of
and
somewhere
set
in
the
seas
was
germany
s
who
already
stood
in
her
path
with
open
cannon
mouths
pointing
but
all
this
had
no
real
connection
with
him
from
the
moment
when
he
had
come
into
this
quiet
orderly
room
and
saw
his
mother
lying
on
the
bed
nothing
beyond
those
four
walls
really
concerned
him
but
though
the
emotional
side
of
his
mind
lay
drugged
and
insensitive
to
anything
outside
he
found
himself
observing
the
details
of
the
room
where
he
waited
with
a
curious
vividness
there
was
a
big
window
opening
down
to
the
ground
in
the
manner
of
a
door
on
to
the
garden
outside
where
a
smooth
lawn
set
with
croquet
hoops
and
edged
with
bright
dozed
in
the
haze
of
the
august
heat
beyond
was
a
row
of
tall
elms
against
which
a
copper
beech
glowed
metallically
and
somewhere
out
of
sight
a
was
being
used
for
michael
heard
the
click
of
its
cropping
journey
growing
fainter
as
it
receded
followed
by
the
pause
as
it
turned
and
its
gradual
crescendo
as
it
approached
again
otherwise
everything
outside
was
strangely
silent
as
the
hot
hours
of
midday
and
early
afternoon
went
by
there
was
no
note
of
nor
any
sound
of
wind
in
the
just
a
little
breeze
stirred
from
time
to
time
enough
to
make
the
slats
of
the
venetian
blind
rattle
faintly
earlier
in
the
day
there
had
come
in
from
the
window
the
smell
of
earth
but
now
that
had
been
sucked
up
by
the
sun
close
beside
the
window
with
her
back
to
the
light
and
facing
the
bed
which
projected
from
one
of
the
side
walls
out
into
the
room
sat
lady
ashbridge
s
nurse
she
was
reading
and
the
rustle
of
the
turned
page
was
regular
but
regular
and
constant
also
were
her
glances
towards
the
bed
where
her
patient
lay
at
intervals
she
put
down
her
book
marking
the
place
with
a
slip
of
paper
and
came
to
watch
by
the
bed
for
a
moment
looking
at
lady
ashbridge
s
face
and
listening
to
her
breathing
her
eye
met
michael
s
always
as
she
did
this
and
in
answer
to
his
mute
question
each
time
she
gave
him
a
little
or
perhaps
a
whispered
word
or
two
that
told
him
there
was
no
change
opposite
the
bed
was
the
empty
fireplace
and
at
the
foot
of
it
a
table
on
which
stood
a
vase
of
roses
michael
was
conscious
of
the
scent
of
these
every
now
and
then
and
at
intervals
of
the
faint
rather
sickly
smell
of
ether
a
japan
screen
ornamented
with
storks
in
gold
thread
stood
near
the
door
and
the
there
was
a
chest
of
drawers
on
one
side
of
the
fireplace
a
wardrobe
with
a
door
on
the
other
a
to
one
side
of
the
window
a
few
prints
on
the
plain
blue
walls
and
a
dark
blue
drugget
carpet
on
the
floor
and
all
these
ordinary
appurtenances
of
a
bedroom
etched
themselves
into
michael
s
mind
biting
their
way
into
it
by
the
acid
of
his
own
suspense
finally
there
was
the
bed
where
his
mother
lay
the
coverlet
of
blue
silk
upon
it
he
knew
was
somehow
familiar
to
him
and
after
fitful
gropings
in
his
mind
to
establish
the
association
he
remembered
that
it
had
been
on
the
bed
in
her
room
in
curzon
street
and
supposed
that
it
had
been
brought
here
with
others
of
her
personal
belongings
a
little
core
of
light
focused
on
one
of
the
brass
balls
at
the
head
of
the
bed
caught
his
eye
and
he
saw
that
the
sun
beginning
to
decline
came
in
under
the
venetian
blind
the
nurse
sitting
in
the
window
noticed
this
also
and
lowered
it
the
thought
of
sylvia
crossed
his
brain
for
a
moment
then
he
thought
of
his
father
but
every
train
of
reflection
dissolved
almost
as
soon
as
it
was
formed
and
he
came
back
again
and
again
to
his
mother
s
face
it
was
perfectly
peaceful
and
strangely
as
if
the
cool
soothing
hand
of
death
which
presently
would
quiet
all
trouble
for
her
had
been
already
at
work
there
erasing
the
marks
that
the
years
had
graven
upon
it
and
yet
it
was
not
so
much
young
as
ageless
it
seemed
to
have
passed
beyond
the
register
and
limitations
of
time
sometimes
for
a
moment
it
was
like
the
face
of
a
stranger
and
then
suddenly
it
would
become
beloved
and
familiar
again
it
was
just
so
she
had
looked
when
she
came
so
timidly
into
his
room
one
night
at
ashbridge
asking
him
if
it
would
be
troublesome
to
him
if
she
sat
and
talked
with
him
for
a
little
the
mouth
was
a
little
parted
for
her
slow
even
breathing
the
corners
of
it
smiled
and
yet
he
was
not
sure
if
they
smiled
it
was
hard
to
tell
for
she
lay
there
quite
flat
without
pillows
and
he
looked
at
her
from
an
unusual
angle
sometimes
he
felt
as
if
he
had
been
sitting
there
watching
for
uncounted
years
and
then
again
the
hours
that
he
had
been
here
appeared
to
have
lasted
but
for
a
moment
as
if
he
had
but
looked
once
at
her
as
the
day
declined
the
breeze
of
evening
awoke
rattling
the
blind
by
now
the
sun
had
swung
farther
west
and
the
nurse
pulled
the
blind
up
outside
in
the
bushes
in
the
garden
the
call
of
birds
to
each
other
had
begun
and
a
thrush
came
close
to
the
window
and
sang
a
liquid
phrase
and
then
repeated
it
michael
glanced
there
and
saw
the
bird
with
throat
that
throbbed
with
the
notes
and
then
looking
back
to
the
bed
he
saw
that
his
mother
s
eyes
were
open
she
looked
vaguely
about
the
room
for
a
moment
as
if
she
had
awoke
from
some
deep
sleep
and
found
herself
in
an
unfamiliar
place
then
turning
her
head
slightly
she
saw
him
and
there
was
no
longer
any
question
as
to
whether
her
mouth
smiled
for
all
her
face
was
flooded
with
deep
serene
joy
he
bent
towards
her
and
her
lips
parted
michael
my
dear
she
said
gently
michael
heard
the
rustle
of
the
nurse
s
dress
as
she
got
up
and
came
to
the
bedside
he
slipped
from
his
chair
on
to
his
knees
so
that
his
face
was
near
his
mother
s
he
felt
in
his
heart
that
the
moment
he
had
so
longed
for
was
to
be
granted
him
that
she
had
come
back
to
him
not
only
as
he
had
known
her
during
the
weeks
that
they
had
lived
alone
together
when
his
presence
made
her
so
content
but
in
a
manner
infinitely
more
real
and
more
embracing
have
you
been
sitting
here
all
the
time
while
i
slept
dear
she
asked
have
you
been
waiting
for
me
to
come
back
to
you
yes
and
you
have
come
he
said
she
looked
at
him
and
the
which
before
had
been
veiled
and
clouded
came
out
with
all
the
tender
radiance
of
evening
sun
with
the
clear
shining
after
rain
i
knew
you
wouldn
t
fail
me
my
darling
she
said
you
were
so
patient
with
me
in
the
trouble
i
have
been
through
it
was
a
nightmare
but
it
has
michael
bent
forward
and
kissed
her
yes
mother
he
said
it
has
all
she
was
silent
a
moment
is
your
father
here
she
said
no
but
he
will
come
at
once
if
you
would
like
to
see
yes
send
for
him
dear
if
it
would
not
vex
him
to
come
she
said
or
get
somebody
else
to
send
i
don
t
want
you
to
leave
i
m
not
going
to
said
he
the
nurse
went
to
the
door
gave
some
message
and
presently
returned
to
the
other
side
of
the
bed
then
lady
ashbridge
spoke
again
is
this
death
she
asked
michael
raised
his
eyes
to
the
figure
standing
by
the
bed
she
nodded
to
him
he
bent
forward
again
yes
dear
mother
he
said
for
a
moment
her
eyes
dilated
then
grew
quiet
again
and
the
smile
returned
to
her
mouth
i
m
not
frightened
michael
she
said
with
you
there
it
isn
t
lonely
or
she
raised
her
head
my
son
she
said
in
a
voice
loud
and
triumphant
then
her
head
fell
back
again
and
she
lay
with
face
close
to
his
and
her
eyelids
quivered
and
shut
her
breath
came
slow
and
regular
as
if
she
slept
then
he
heard
that
she
missed
a
breath
and
soon
after
another
then
without
struggle
at
all
her
breathing
ceased
and
outside
on
the
lawn
close
by
the
open
window
the
thrush
still
sang
it
was
an
hour
later
when
michael
left
having
waited
for
his
father
s
arrival
and
drove
to
town
through
the
clear
falling
dusk
he
was
conscious
of
no
feeling
of
grief
at
all
only
of
a
complete
pervading
happiness
he
could
not
have
imagined
so
perfect
a
close
nor
could
he
have
desired
anything
different
from
that
imperishable
moment
when
his
mother
all
trouble
past
had
come
back
to
him
in
the
serene
calm
of
love
as
he
entered
london
he
saw
the
newsboards
all
placarded
with
one
fact
england
had
declared
war
on
germany
he
went
not
to
his
own
flat
but
straight
to
maidstone
crescent
with
those
few
minutes
in
which
his
mother
had
known
him
the
stupor
that
had
beset
his
emotions
all
day
passed
off
and
he
felt
himself
longing
as
he
had
never
longed
before
for
sylvia
s
presence
long
ago
he
had
given
her
all
that
he
knew
of
as
himself
now
there
was
a
fresh
gift
he
had
to
give
her
all
that
those
moments
had
taught
him
even
as
already
they
were
knitted
into
him
made
part
of
him
so
must
they
be
to
her
and
when
they
had
shared
that
when
like
water
gushing
from
a
spring
she
flooded
him
there
was
that
other
news
which
he
had
seen
on
the
newsboards
that
they
had
to
share
together
sylvia
had
been
alone
all
day
with
her
mother
but
before
michael
arrived
falbe
after
a
few
more
encouraging
remarks
about
war
in
general
to
the
effect
that
germany
would
soon
beat
france
and
what
a
blessing
it
was
that
england
was
an
island
had
taken
her
book
up
to
her
room
and
sylvia
was
sitting
alone
in
the
deep
dusk
of
the
evening
she
did
not
even
trouble
to
turn
on
the
light
for
she
felt
unable
to
apply
herself
to
any
practical
task
and
she
could
think
and
take
hold
of
herself
better
in
the
dark
all
day
she
had
longed
for
michael
to
come
to
her
though
she
had
not
cared
to
see
anybody
else
and
several
times
she
had
rung
him
up
only
to
find
that
he
was
still
out
supposedly
with
his
mother
for
he
had
been
summoned
to
her
early
that
morning
and
since
then
no
news
had
come
of
him
just
before
dinner
had
arrived
the
announcement
of
the
declaration
of
war
and
sylvia
sat
now
trying
to
find
some
escape
from
the
encompassing
nightmare
she
felt
confused
and
distracted
with
it
she
could
not
think
consecutively
but
only
contemplate
shudderingly
the
series
of
pictures
that
presented
themselves
to
her
mind
somewhere
now
in
the
hosts
of
the
fatherland
which
was
hers
also
was
hermann
the
brother
who
was
part
of
herself
when
she
thought
of
him
she
seemed
to
be
with
him
to
see
the
glint
of
his
rifle
to
feel
her
heart
on
his
heart
big
with
passionate
patriotism
she
had
no
doubt
that
patriotism
formed
the
essence
of
his
consciousness
and
yet
by
now
probably
he
knew
that
the
land
beloved
by
him
where
he
had
made
his
home
was
at
war
with
his
own
she
could
not
but
know
how
often
his
thoughts
dwelled
here
in
the
dark
quiet
studio
where
she
sat
and
where
so
many
days
of
happiness
had
been
passed
she
knew
what
she
was
to
him
she
and
her
mother
and
michael
and
the
hosts
of
friends
in
this
land
which
had
become
his
foe
would
he
have
gone
she
asked
herself
if
he
had
guessed
that
there
would
be
war
between
the
two
she
thought
he
would
though
she
knew
that
for
herself
she
would
have
made
it
as
hard
as
possible
for
him
to
do
so
she
would
have
used
every
argument
she
could
think
of
to
dissuade
him
and
yet
she
felt
that
her
entreaties
would
have
beaten
in
vain
against
the
granite
of
his
and
her
nationality
dimly
she
had
foreseen
this
contingency
when
a
few
days
ago
she
had
asked
michael
what
he
would
do
if
england
went
to
war
and
now
that
contingency
was
realised
and
hermann
was
even
now
perhaps
on
his
way
to
violate
the
neutrality
of
the
country
for
the
sake
of
which
england
had
gone
to
war
on
the
other
side
was
michael
into
whose
keeping
she
had
given
herself
and
her
love
and
on
which
side
was
she
it
was
then
that
the
nightmare
came
close
to
her
she
could
not
tell
she
was
utterly
unable
to
decide
her
heart
was
michael
s
her
heart
was
her
brother
s
also
the
one
personified
germany
for
her
the
other
england
it
was
as
if
she
saw
hermann
and
michael
with
bayonet
and
rifle
stalking
each
other
across
some
land
of
and
hollows
creeping
closer
to
each
other
always
closer
she
felt
as
if
she
would
have
gladly
given
herself
over
to
an
eternity
of
torment
if
only
they
could
have
had
one
hour
more
all
three
of
them
together
here
as
on
that
night
of
stars
and
peace
when
first
there
came
the
news
which
for
the
moment
had
disquieted
hermann
she
longed
as
with
thirst
for
michael
to
come
and
as
her
solitude
became
more
and
more
intolerable
a
hundred
hideous
fancies
obsessed
her
what
if
some
accident
had
happened
to
michael
or
what
if
in
this
tremendous
breaking
of
ties
that
the
war
entailed
he
felt
that
he
could
not
see
her
she
knew
that
was
an
impossibility
but
the
whole
world
had
become
impossible
and
there
was
no
escape
somehow
she
had
to
adjust
herself
to
the
unthinkable
somehow
her
relations
both
with
hermann
and
michael
had
to
remain
absolutely
unshaken
even
that
was
not
enough
they
had
to
be
strengthened
made
impregnable
then
came
a
knock
on
the
side
door
of
the
studio
that
led
into
the
street
michael
often
came
that
way
without
passing
through
the
house
and
with
a
sense
of
relief
she
ran
to
it
and
unlocked
it
and
even
as
he
stepped
in
before
any
word
of
greeting
had
been
exchanged
she
flung
herself
on
him
with
fingers
eager
for
the
touch
of
his
solidity
oh
my
dear
she
said
i
have
longed
for
you
just
longed
for
you
i
never
wanted
you
so
much
i
have
been
sitting
in
the
dark
desolate
desolate
and
oh
my
darling
what
a
beast
i
am
to
think
of
nothing
but
myself
i
am
ashamed
what
of
your
mother
michael
she
turned
on
the
light
as
they
walked
back
across
the
studio
and
michael
saw
that
her
eyes
which
were
a
little
dazzled
by
the
change
from
the
dark
into
the
light
were
dim
with
unshed
tears
and
her
hands
clung
to
him
as
never
before
had
they
clung
she
needed
him
now
with
that
imperative
need
which
in
trouble
can
only
turn
to
love
for
comfort
she
wanted
that
only
the
fact
of
him
with
her
in
this
land
in
which
she
had
suddenly
become
an
alien
an
enemy
though
all
her
friends
except
hermann
were
here
and
instantaneously
as
a
baby
at
the
breast
she
found
that
all
his
strength
and
serenity
were
hers
they
sat
down
on
the
sofa
by
the
piano
side
by
side
with
hands
intertwined
before
michael
answered
he
looked
up
at
her
as
he
spoke
and
in
his
eyes
was
the
quiet
of
love
and
death
my
mother
died
an
hour
ago
he
said
i
was
with
her
and
as
i
had
longed
might
happen
she
came
back
to
me
before
she
died
for
two
or
three
minutes
she
was
herself
and
then
she
said
to
me
my
son
and
soon
she
ceased
oh
michael
she
said
and
for
a
little
while
there
was
silence
and
in
turn
it
was
her
presence
that
he
clung
to
presently
he
spoke
again
sylvia
i
m
so
frightfully
hungry
he
said
i
don
t
think
i
ve
eaten
anything
since
breakfast
may
we
go
and
forage
oh
you
poor
thing
she
cried
yes
let
s
go
and
see
what
there
instantly
she
busied
herself
hermann
left
the
cellar
key
on
the
michael
she
said
get
some
wine
out
dear
mother
and
i
don
t
drink
any
and
there
s
some
ham
i
know
while
you
are
getting
wine
i
ll
broil
some
and
there
were
some
strawberries
i
shall
have
some
supper
with
you
what
a
good
thought
and
you
must
be
as
they
ate
they
talked
perfectly
simply
and
naturally
of
the
hundred
associations
which
this
studio
meal
at
the
end
of
the
evening
called
up
concerning
the
sunday
night
parties
there
was
an
occasion
on
which
hermann
tried
to
recollect
how
to
mull
beer
with
results
that
smelled
like
a
brickfield
there
was
another
when
a
poached
egg
had
fallen
exploding
softly
as
it
fell
into
the
piano
there
was
the
occasion
the
first
on
which
michael
had
been
present
when
two
eminent
actors
imitated
each
other
another
when
francis
came
and
made
himself
so
immensely
agreeable
it
was
after
that
one
that
sylvia
and
hermann
had
sat
and
talked
in
front
of
the
stove
discussing
as
sylvia
laughed
to
remember
what
she
would
say
when
michael
proposed
to
her
then
had
come
the
break
in
michael
s
attendances
and
as
sylvia
allowed
a
certain
in
gaiety
but
it
was
really
hermann
and
i
who
made
you
gay
originally
she
said
we
take
a
wonderful
deal
of
credit
for
all
this
was
as
completely
natural
for
them
as
was
the
impromptu
meal
and
soon
without
effort
michael
spoke
of
his
mother
again
and
presently
afterwards
of
the
news
of
war
but
with
him
by
her
side
sylvia
found
her
courage
come
back
to
her
the
news
itself
all
that
it
certainly
implied
and
all
the
horror
that
it
held
no
longer
filled
her
with
the
sense
that
it
was
impossibly
terrible
michael
did
not
diminish
the
awfulness
of
it
but
he
gave
her
the
power
of
looking
out
bravely
at
it
nor
did
he
shrink
from
speaking
of
all
that
had
been
to
her
so
grim
a
nightmare
you
haven
t
heard
from
hermann
he
asked
no
and
i
suppose
we
can
t
hear
now
he
is
with
his
regiment
that
s
all
nor
shall
we
hear
of
him
till
there
is
peace
she
came
a
little
closer
to
him
michael
i
have
to
face
it
that
i
may
never
see
hermann
again
she
said
mother
doesn
t
fear
it
you
know
she
the
darling
she
lives
in
a
sort
of
dream
i
don
t
want
her
to
wake
from
it
but
how
can
i
get
accustomed
to
the
thought
that
perhaps
i
shan
t
see
hermann
again
i
must
get
accustomed
to
it
i
ve
got
to
live
with
it
and
not
quarrel
with
he
took
up
her
hand
enclosing
it
in
his
but
one
doesn
t
quarrel
with
the
big
things
of
life
he
said
isn
t
it
so
we
haven
t
any
quarrel
with
things
like
death
and
duty
dear
me
i
m
afraid
i
m
preach
then
she
said
well
it
s
just
that
we
don
t
quarrel
with
them
they
manage
themselves
hermann
s
going
managed
itself
it
had
to
her
voice
quivered
as
she
spoke
now
are
you
going
she
asked
will
that
have
to
be
michael
looked
at
her
a
moment
with
infinite
tenderness
oh
my
dear
of
course
it
will
he
said
of
course
one
doesn
t
know
yet
what
the
war
office
will
do
about
the
army
i
suppose
it
s
possible
that
they
will
send
troops
to
france
all
that
concerns
me
is
that
i
shall
rejoin
again
if
they
call
up
the
and
they
will
yes
i
should
think
that
is
inevitable
and
you
know
there
s
something
big
about
it
i
m
not
warlike
you
know
but
i
could
not
fail
to
be
a
soldier
under
these
new
conditions
any
more
than
i
could
continue
being
a
soldier
when
all
it
meant
was
to
be
ornamental
hermann
in
bursts
of
pride
and
patriotism
used
to
call
us
but
he
s
wrong
now
we
re
not
going
to
be
any
she
did
not
answer
him
but
he
felt
her
hand
press
close
in
the
palm
of
his
i
can
t
tell
you
how
i
dreaded
we
shouldn
t
go
to
war
he
said
that
has
been
a
nightmare
if
you
like
it
would
have
been
the
end
of
us
if
we
had
stood
aside
and
seen
germany
violate
a
solemn
even
with
michael
close
to
her
the
call
of
her
blood
made
itself
audible
to
sylvia
instinctively
she
withdrew
her
hand
from
his
ah
you
don
t
understand
germany
at
all
she
said
hermann
always
felt
that
too
he
told
me
he
felt
he
was
talking
gibberish
to
you
when
he
spoke
of
it
it
is
clearly
life
and
death
to
germany
to
move
against
france
as
quickly
as
but
there
s
a
direct
frontier
between
the
two
said
he
no
doubt
but
an
impossible
michael
frowned
drawing
his
big
eyebrows
together
but
nothing
can
justify
the
violation
of
a
national
oath
he
said
that
s
the
basis
of
civilisation
a
thing
like
but
if
it
s
a
necessity
if
a
nation
s
existence
depends
on
it
she
asked
oh
michael
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
know
for
a
little
i
am
entirely
english
and
then
something
calls
to
me
from
beyond
the
rhine
there
s
the
hopelessness
of
it
for
me
and
such
as
me
you
are
english
there
s
no
question
about
it
for
you
but
for
us
i
love
england
i
needn
t
tell
you
that
but
can
one
ever
forget
the
land
of
one
s
birth
can
i
help
feeling
the
necessity
germany
is
under
i
can
t
believe
that
she
has
wantonly
provoked
war
with
but
consider
said
he
she
got
up
suddenly
i
can
t
argue
about
it
she
said
i
am
english
and
i
am
german
you
must
make
the
best
of
me
as
i
am
but
do
be
sorry
for
me
and
never
never
forget
that
i
love
you
entirely
that
s
the
root
fact
between
us
i
can
t
go
deeper
than
that
because
that
reaches
to
the
very
bottom
of
my
soul
shall
we
leave
it
so
michael
and
not
ever
talk
of
it
again
wouldn
t
that
be
best
there
was
no
question
of
choice
for
michael
in
accepting
that
appeal
he
knew
with
the
inmost
fibre
of
his
being
that
sylvia
being
sylvia
nothing
that
she
could
say
or
do
or
feel
could
possibly
part
him
from
her
when
he
looked
at
it
directly
and
simply
like
that
there
was
nothing
that
could
blur
the
verity
of
it
but
the
truth
of
what
she
said
the
reality
of
that
call
of
the
blood
seemed
to
cast
a
shadow
over
it
he
knew
beyond
all
other
knowledge
that
it
was
there
only
it
looked
out
at
him
with
a
shadow
faint
but
unmistakable
fallen
across
it
but
the
sense
of
that
made
him
the
more
eagerly
accept
her
suggestion
yes
darling
we
ll
never
speak
of
it
again
he
said
that
would
be
much
lady
ashbridge
s
funeral
took
place
three
days
afterwards
down
in
suffolk
and
those
hours
detached
themselves
in
michael
s
mind
from
all
that
had
gone
before
and
all
that
might
follow
like
a
little
piece
of
blue
sky
in
the
midst
of
storm
clouds
the
limitations
of
man
s
consciousness
which
forbid
him
to
think
poignantly
about
two
things
at
once
hedged
that
day
in
with
an
impenetrable
barrier
so
that
while
it
lasted
and
afterwards
for
ever
in
memory
it
was
unflecked
by
trouble
or
anxiety
and
hung
between
heaven
and
earth
in
a
serenity
of
its
own
the
coffin
lay
that
night
in
his
mother
s
bedroom
which
was
next
to
michael
s
and
when
he
went
up
to
bed
he
found
himself
listening
for
any
sound
that
came
from
there
it
seemed
but
yesterday
when
he
had
gone
rather
early
upstairs
and
after
sitting
a
minute
or
two
in
front
of
his
fire
had
heard
that
timid
knock
on
the
door
which
had
meant
the
opening
of
a
mother
s
heart
to
him
he
felt
it
would
scarcely
be
strange
if
that
knock
came
again
and
if
she
entered
once
more
to
be
with
him
from
the
moment
he
came
upstairs
the
rest
of
the
world
was
shut
down
to
him
he
entered
his
bedroom
as
if
he
entered
a
sanctuary
that
was
scented
with
the
incense
of
her
love
he
knew
exactly
how
her
knock
had
sounded
when
she
came
in
here
that
night
when
first
it
burned
for
him
his
ears
were
alert
for
it
to
come
again
once
his
blind
tapped
against
the
frame
of
his
open
window
and
though
knowing
it
was
that
he
heard
himself
whisper
for
she
could
hear
his
whisper
come
in
mother
and
sat
up
in
his
deep
chair
looking
towards
the
door
but
only
the
blind
tapped
again
and
outside
in
the
moonlit
dusk
an
owl
hooted
he
remembered
she
liked
owls
once
when
they
lived
alone
in
curzon
street
some
noise
outside
reminded
her
of
the
owls
that
hooted
at
ashbridge
she
had
imitated
their
note
saying
it
sounded
like
sleep
she
had
sat
in
a
chair
close
to
him
when
at
christmas
she
paid
him
that
visit
and
now
he
again
drew
it
close
to
his
own
and
laid
his
hand
on
its
arm
petsy
ii
had
come
in
with
her
and
she
had
hoped
that
he
would
not
annoy
michael
there
were
steps
in
the
passage
outside
his
room
and
he
heard
a
little
shrill
bark
he
opened
his
door
and
found
his
mother
s
maid
there
trying
to
entice
petsy
away
from
the
room
next
to
his
the
little
dog
was
curled
up
against
it
and
now
and
then
he
turned
round
scratching
at
it
asking
to
enter
he
won
t
come
away
my
lord
said
the
maid
he
s
gone
back
a
dozen
times
to
the
michael
bent
down
come
petsy
he
said
come
to
bed
in
my
the
dog
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
as
if
weighing
his
trustworthiness
then
he
got
up
and
with
grotesque
chinese
walk
came
to
him
he
ll
be
all
right
with
me
he
said
to
the
maid
he
took
petsy
into
his
room
next
door
and
laid
him
on
the
chair
in
which
his
mother
had
sat
the
dog
moved
round
in
a
circle
once
or
twice
and
then
settled
himself
down
to
sleep
michael
went
to
bed
also
and
lay
awake
about
a
couple
of
minutes
not
thinking
but
only
being
while
the
owls
hooted
outside
he
awoke
into
complete
consciousness
knowing
that
something
had
aroused
him
even
as
three
days
ago
when
the
telephone
rang
to
summon
him
to
his
mother
s
deathbed
then
he
did
not
know
what
had
awakened
him
but
now
he
was
sure
that
there
had
been
a
tapping
on
his
door
and
after
he
had
sat
up
in
bed
completely
awake
he
heard
petsy
give
a
little
welcoming
bark
then
came
the
noise
of
his
small
soft
tail
beating
against
the
cushion
in
the
chair
michael
had
no
feeling
of
fright
at
all
only
of
longing
for
something
that
physically
could
not
be
and
longing
only
longing
once
more
he
said
come
in
he
believed
he
heard
the
door
whisper
on
the
carpet
but
he
saw
nothing
only
the
room
was
full
of
his
mother
s
presence
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
obedience
to
her
he
lay
down
completely
satisfied
he
felt
no
curiosity
to
see
or
hear
more
she
was
there
and
that
was
enough
he
woke
again
a
little
after
dawn
petsy
between
the
window
and
the
door
had
jumped
on
to
his
bed
to
get
out
of
the
draught
of
the
morning
wind
for
the
door
was
opened
that
morning
the
coffin
was
carried
down
the
long
winding
path
above
the
reach
where
michael
and
francis
at
christmas
had
heard
the
sound
of
stealthy
rowing
and
on
to
the
boat
that
awaited
it
to
ferry
it
across
to
the
church
there
was
high
tide
and
as
they
passed
over
the
estuary
the
stillness
of
supreme
noon
bore
to
them
the
tolling
of
the
bell
the
mourners
from
the
house
followed
just
three
of
them
lord
ashbridge
michael
and
aunt
barbara
for
the
rest
were
to
assemble
at
the
church
but
of
all
that
one
moment
stood
out
for
michael
above
all
others
when
as
they
entered
the
graveyard
someone
whom
he
could
not
see
said
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
and
he
heard
that
his
father
by
whom
he
walked
suddenly
caught
his
breath
in
a
sob
all
that
day
there
persisted
that
sense
of
complete
detachment
from
all
but
her
whose
body
they
had
laid
to
rest
on
the
windy
hill
overlooking
the
broad
water
his
father
aunt
barbara
the
cousins
and
relations
who
thronged
the
church
were
no
more
than
inanimate
shadows
compared
with
her
whose
presence
had
come
last
night
into
his
room
and
had
not
left
him
since
the
affairs
of
the
world
drums
and
the
torch
of
war
had
passed
for
those
hours
from
his
knowledge
as
at
the
centre
of
a
cyclone
there
was
a
windless
calm
he
knew
he
would
pass
out
into
the
tumult
again
and
the
minutes
slipped
like
pearls
from
a
string
dropping
into
the
dim
gulf
where
the
tempest
raged
he
went
back
to
town
next
morning
after
a
short
interview
with
his
father
who
was
coming
up
later
in
the
day
when
he
told
him
that
he
intended
to
go
back
to
his
regiment
as
soon
as
possible
but
knowing
that
he
meant
to
go
by
the
slow
midday
train
his
father
proposed
to
stop
the
express
for
him
that
went
through
a
few
minutes
before
michael
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
chapter
xv
it
was
but
a
day
or
two
after
the
outbreak
of
the
war
that
it
was
believed
that
an
expeditionary
force
was
to
be
sent
to
france
to
help
in
arresting
the
teutonic
tide
that
was
now
breaking
over
belgium
but
no
public
and
authoritative
news
came
till
after
the
first
draft
of
the
force
had
actually
set
foot
on
french
soil
from
the
regiment
of
the
guards
which
michael
had
rejoined
francis
was
among
the
first
batch
of
officers
to
go
and
that
evening
michael
took
down
the
news
to
sylvia
already
stories
of
german
barbarity
were
rife
of
women
violated
of
defenceless
civilians
being
shot
down
for
no
object
except
to
terrorise
and
to
bring
home
to
the
belgians
the
unwisdom
of
presuming
to
cross
the
will
of
the
sovereign
people
in
the
evening
papers
there
had
been
a
fresh
batch
of
these
revolting
stories
and
when
michael
entered
the
studio
where
sylvia
and
her
mother
were
sitting
he
saw
the
girl
let
drop
behind
the
sofa
the
paper
she
had
been
reading
he
guessed
what
she
must
have
found
there
for
he
had
already
seen
the
paper
himself
and
her
silence
her
distraction
and
the
misery
of
her
face
confirmed
his
conjecture
i
ve
brought
you
a
little
news
he
said
the
first
draft
from
the
regiment
went
off
falbe
put
down
her
book
marking
the
place
well
that
does
look
like
business
then
she
said
though
i
must
say
i
should
feel
safer
if
they
didn
t
send
our
soldiers
away
where
have
they
gone
to
destination
unknown
said
michael
but
it
s
france
my
cousin
has
francis
asked
sylvia
oh
how
wicked
to
send
boys
like
michael
saw
that
her
nerves
were
sharply
on
edge
she
had
given
him
no
greeting
and
now
as
he
sat
down
she
moved
a
little
away
from
him
she
seemed
utterly
unlike
herself
mother
has
been
told
that
every
englishman
is
as
brave
as
two
germans
she
said
she
likes
yes
dear
observed
falbe
placidly
it
makes
one
feel
safer
i
saw
it
in
the
paper
though
i
read
sylvia
turned
on
michael
have
you
seen
the
evening
paper
she
asked
michael
knew
what
was
in
her
mind
i
just
looked
at
it
he
said
there
didn
t
seem
to
be
much
no
only
reports
rumours
lies
said
sylvia
falbe
got
up
it
was
her
habit
to
leave
the
two
alone
together
since
she
was
sure
they
preferred
that
incidentally
also
she
got
on
better
with
her
book
for
she
found
conversation
rather
distracting
but
sylvia
stopped
her
oh
don
t
go
yet
mother
she
said
it
is
very
it
was
clear
that
for
some
reason
she
did
not
want
to
be
left
alone
with
michael
for
never
had
she
done
this
before
nor
did
it
avail
anything
now
for
falbe
who
was
quite
determined
to
pursue
her
reading
without
delay
moved
towards
the
door
but
i
am
sure
michael
wants
to
talk
to
you
dear
she
said
and
you
have
not
seen
him
all
day
i
think
i
shall
go
up
to
sylvia
made
no
further
effort
to
detain
her
but
when
she
had
gone
the
silence
in
which
they
had
so
often
sat
together
had
taken
on
a
perfectly
different
quality
and
what
have
you
been
doing
she
said
tell
me
about
your
day
no
don
t
i
know
it
has
all
been
concerned
with
war
and
i
don
t
want
to
hear
about
i
dined
with
aunt
barbara
said
michael
she
sent
you
her
love
she
also
wondered
why
you
hadn
t
been
to
see
her
for
so
sylvia
gave
a
short
laugh
which
had
no
touch
of
merriment
in
it
did
she
really
she
asked
i
should
have
thought
she
could
have
guessed
she
set
every
nerve
in
my
body
jangling
last
time
i
saw
her
by
the
way
she
talked
about
germans
and
then
suddenly
she
pulled
herself
up
and
apologised
saying
she
had
forgotten
that
made
it
worse
michael
when
you
are
unhappy
kindness
is
even
more
intolerable
than
unkindness
i
would
sooner
have
lady
barbara
abusing
my
people
than
saying
how
sorry
she
is
for
me
don
t
let
s
talk
about
it
let
s
do
something
will
you
play
or
shall
i
sing
let
s
employ
michael
followed
her
lead
ah
do
sing
he
said
it
s
weeks
since
i
have
heard
you
she
went
quickly
over
to
the
bookcase
of
music
by
the
piano
come
then
let
s
sing
and
forget
she
said
hermann
always
said
the
artist
was
of
no
nationality
let
s
begin
quick
these
are
all
german
songs
don
t
let
s
have
those
ah
and
these
too
what
s
to
be
done
all
our
songs
seem
to
be
michael
laughed
but
we
ve
just
settled
that
artists
have
no
nationality
so
i
suppose
art
hasn
t
either
he
said
sylvia
pulled
herself
together
conscious
of
a
want
of
control
and
laid
her
hand
on
michael
s
shoulder
oh
michael
what
should
i
do
without
you
she
said
and
yet
well
let
me
she
had
placed
a
volume
of
schubert
on
the
and
opening
it
at
random
he
found
du
bist
die
she
sang
the
first
verse
but
in
the
middle
of
the
second
she
stopped
i
can
t
she
said
it
s
no
he
turned
round
to
her
oh
i
m
so
sorry
he
said
but
you
know
she
moved
away
from
him
and
walked
down
to
the
empty
fireplace
i
can
t
keep
silence
she
said
though
i
know
we
settled
not
to
talk
of
those
things
when
necessarily
we
can
not
feel
absolutely
at
one
but
just
before
you
came
in
i
was
reading
the
evening
paper
michael
how
can
the
english
be
so
wicked
as
to
print
and
i
suppose
to
believe
those
awful
things
i
find
there
you
told
me
you
had
glanced
at
it
well
did
you
glance
at
the
lies
they
tell
about
german
atrocities
yes
i
saw
them
said
michael
but
it
s
no
use
talking
about
but
aren
t
you
indignant
she
said
doesn
t
your
blood
boil
to
read
of
such
infamous
falsehoods
you
don
t
know
germans
but
i
do
and
it
is
impossible
that
such
things
can
have
michael
felt
profoundly
uncomfortable
some
of
these
stories
which
sylvia
called
lies
were
vouched
for
apparently
by
respectable
testimony
why
talk
about
them
he
said
i
m
sure
we
were
wise
when
we
settled
not
she
shook
her
head
well
i
can
t
live
up
to
that
wisdom
she
said
when
i
think
of
this
war
day
and
night
and
night
and
day
how
can
i
prevent
talking
to
you
about
it
and
those
lies
germans
couldn
t
do
such
things
it
s
a
campaign
of
hate
against
us
set
up
by
the
english
i
daresay
the
german
press
is
no
better
said
michael
if
that
is
so
i
should
be
just
as
indignant
about
the
german
press
said
she
but
it
is
only
your
guess
that
it
is
suddenly
she
stopped
and
came
a
couple
of
steps
nearer
him
michael
it
isn
t
possible
that
you
believe
those
things
of
us
she
said
he
got
up
ah
do
leave
it
alone
sylvia
he
said
i
know
no
more
of
the
truth
or
falsity
of
it
than
you
i
have
seen
just
what
you
have
seen
in
the
you
don
t
feel
the
impossibility
of
it
then
she
asked
no
i
don
t
there
seems
to
have
been
sworn
testimony
war
is
a
cruel
thing
i
hate
it
as
much
as
you
when
men
are
maddened
with
war
you
can
t
tell
what
they
would
do
they
are
not
the
germans
you
know
nor
the
germans
i
know
who
did
such
things
not
the
people
i
saw
when
i
was
with
hermann
in
baireuth
and
munich
a
year
ago
they
are
no
more
the
same
than
a
drunken
man
is
the
same
as
that
man
when
he
is
sober
they
are
two
different
people
drink
has
made
them
different
and
war
has
done
the
same
for
he
held
out
his
hand
to
her
she
moved
a
step
back
from
him
then
you
think
i
suppose
that
hermann
may
be
concerned
in
those
atrocities
she
said
michael
looked
at
her
in
amazement
you
are
talking
sheer
nonsense
sylvia
he
said
not
at
all
it
is
a
logical
inference
just
an
application
of
the
principle
you
have
michael
s
instinct
was
just
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
make
the
final
appeal
saying
we
love
each
other
that
s
all
but
his
reason
prevented
him
sylvia
had
said
a
monstrous
thing
in
cold
blood
when
she
suggested
that
he
thought
hermann
might
be
concerned
in
these
deeds
and
in
cold
blood
not
by
appealing
to
her
emotions
must
she
withdraw
that
i
m
not
going
to
argue
about
it
he
said
i
want
you
to
tell
me
at
once
that
i
am
right
that
it
was
sheer
nonsense
to
put
no
other
name
to
it
when
you
suggested
that
i
thought
that
of
oh
pray
put
another
name
to
it
she
said
very
well
it
was
a
wanton
falsehood
said
michael
and
you
know
truly
this
hellish
nightmare
of
war
and
hate
which
had
arisen
brought
with
it
a
brood
not
less
terrible
a
day
ago
an
hour
ago
he
would
have
merely
laughed
at
the
possibility
of
such
a
situation
between
sylvia
and
himself
yet
here
it
was
they
were
in
the
middle
of
it
now
she
looked
up
at
him
flashing
with
indignation
and
a
retort
as
stinging
as
his
rose
to
her
lips
and
then
quite
suddenly
all
her
anger
went
from
her
as
her
heart
told
her
in
a
voice
that
would
not
be
silenced
the
complete
justice
of
what
he
had
said
and
the
appeal
that
michael
refrained
from
making
was
made
by
her
to
herself
remorse
held
her
on
its
spikes
for
her
abominable
suggestion
and
with
it
came
a
sense
of
utter
desolation
and
misery
of
hatred
for
herself
in
having
thus
quietly
and
deliberately
said
what
she
had
said
she
could
not
account
for
it
nor
excuse
herself
on
the
plea
that
she
had
spoken
in
passion
for
she
had
spoken
as
he
felt
in
cold
blood
hence
came
the
misery
in
the
knowledge
that
she
must
have
wounded
michael
intolerably
her
lips
so
quivered
that
when
she
first
tried
to
speak
no
words
would
come
that
she
was
truly
ashamed
brought
no
relief
no
ease
to
her
surrender
for
she
knew
that
it
was
her
real
self
who
had
spoken
thus
incredibly
but
she
could
at
least
disown
that
part
of
her
i
beg
your
pardon
michael
she
said
i
was
atrocious
will
you
forgive
me
because
i
am
so
he
had
nothing
but
love
for
her
love
and
its
kinsman
pity
oh
my
dear
fancy
you
asking
that
he
said
just
for
the
moment
of
their
reconciliation
it
seemed
to
both
that
they
came
closer
to
each
other
than
they
had
ever
been
before
and
the
chance
of
the
need
of
any
such
another
reconciliation
was
impossible
to
the
verge
of
laughableness
so
that
before
five
minutes
were
past
he
could
make
the
smile
break
through
her
tears
at
the
absurdity
of
the
moment
that
now
seemed
quite
unreal
yet
that
which
was
at
the
root
of
their
temporary
antagonism
was
not
removed
by
the
reconciliation
at
most
they
had
succeeded
in
cutting
off
the
poisonous
shoot
that
had
suddenly
sprouted
from
it
the
truth
of
this
in
the
days
that
followed
was
horribly
demonstrated
it
was
not
that
they
ever
again
came
to
the
spoken
bitterness
of
words
for
the
sharpness
of
them
once
experienced
was
shunned
by
each
of
them
but
times
without
number
they
had
to
sheer
off
and
not
approach
the
ground
where
these
poisoned
tendrils
trailed
and
in
that
sense
of
having
to
take
care
to
be
watchful
lest
a
chance
word
should
bring
the
peril
close
to
them
the
atmosphere
of
complete
ease
and
confidence
in
which
alone
love
can
flourish
was
tainted
love
was
there
but
its
flowers
could
not
expand
it
could
not
grow
in
the
midst
of
this
bitter
air
and
what
made
the
situation
more
and
increasingly
difficult
was
the
fact
that
next
to
their
love
for
each
other
the
emotion
that
most
filled
the
mind
of
each
was
this
sense
of
it
was
impossible
that
the
news
of
the
war
should
not
be
mentioned
for
that
would
have
created
an
intolerable
unreality
and
all
that
was
in
their
power
was
to
avoid
all
discussion
to
suppress
from
speech
all
the
feelings
with
which
the
news
filled
them
every
day
too
there
came
fresh
stories
of
german
abominations
committed
on
the
belgians
and
each
knew
that
the
other
had
seen
them
and
yet
neither
could
mention
them
for
while
sylvia
could
not
believe
them
michael
could
not
help
doing
so
and
thus
there
was
no
common
ground
on
which
they
could
speak
of
them
often
falbe
in
whose
blood
it
would
seem
no
sense
of
race
beat
at
all
would
add
to
the
embarrassment
by
childlike
comments
saying
at
one
time
in
reference
to
such
things
that
she
made
a
point
of
not
believing
all
she
saw
in
the
newspapers
or
at
another
ejaculating
well
the
germans
do
seem
to
have
behaved
very
cruelly
again
but
no
emotion
appeared
to
colour
these
speeches
while
all
the
emotion
of
the
world
surged
and
bubbled
behind
the
silence
of
the
other
two
then
followed
the
darkest
days
that
england
perhaps
had
ever
known
when
the
german
armies
having
overcome
the
resistance
of
belgium
suddenly
swept
forward
again
across
france
pushing
before
them
like
the
jetsam
and
flotsam
on
the
rim
of
the
advancing
tide
the
allied
armies
often
in
these
appalling
weeks
michael
would
hesitate
as
to
whether
he
should
go
to
see
sylvia
or
not
so
unbearable
seemed
the
fact
that
she
did
not
and
could
not
feel
or
understand
what
england
was
going
through
so
far
from
blaming
her
for
it
he
knew
that
it
could
not
be
otherwise
for
her
blood
called
to
her
even
as
his
to
him
while
somewhere
in
the
onrush
of
those
advancing
and
devouring
waves
was
her
brother
with
whom
so
it
had
often
seemed
to
him
she
was
one
soul
thus
while
in
that
his
whole
sympathy
and
whole
comprehension
of
her
love
was
with
him
there
was
as
well
all
that
deep
silent
english
patriotism
of
which
till
now
he
had
scarcely
been
conscious
praying
with
mute
entreaty
that
disaster
and
destruction
and
defeat
might
overwhelm
those
advancing
hordes
once
when
the
anxiety
and
peril
were
at
their
height
he
made
up
his
mind
not
to
see
her
that
day
and
spent
the
evening
by
himself
but
later
when
he
was
actually
on
his
way
to
bed
he
knew
he
could
not
keep
away
from
her
and
though
it
was
already
midnight
he
drove
down
to
chelsea
and
found
her
sitting
up
waiting
for
the
chance
of
his
coming
for
a
moment
as
she
greeted
him
and
he
kissed
her
silently
they
escaped
from
the
encompassing
horror
ah
you
have
come
she
said
i
thought
perhaps
you
might
i
have
wanted
you
the
roar
of
artillery
the
internecine
strife
were
still
just
for
a
few
seconds
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
for
him
but
her
nor
for
her
anything
but
him
i
couldn
t
go
to
bed
without
just
seeing
you
he
said
i
won
t
keep
you
they
stood
with
hands
clasped
but
if
you
hadn
t
come
michael
she
said
i
should
have
and
then
the
roar
and
the
horror
began
again
her
words
were
the
simplest
the
most
directly
spoken
to
him
yet
could
not
but
evoke
the
spectres
that
for
the
moment
had
vanished
she
had
meant
to
let
her
love
for
him
speak
it
had
spoken
and
instantly
through
the
momentary
sunlight
of
it
there
loomed
the
fierce
and
enormous
shadow
it
could
not
be
banished
from
their
most
secret
hearts
even
when
the
doors
were
shut
and
they
were
alone
together
thus
it
made
its
entrance
terrible
and
all
love
s
bolts
and
bars
could
not
keep
it
out
here
was
the
tragedy
of
it
that
they
could
not
stand
embraced
with
clasped
hands
and
look
at
it
together
and
so
rob
it
of
its
terrors
for
at
the
sight
of
it
their
hands
were
loosened
from
each
other
s
and
in
its
presence
they
were
forced
to
stand
apart
in
his
heart
as
surely
as
he
knew
her
love
michael
knew
that
this
great
shadow
under
which
england
lay
was
shot
with
sunlight
for
sylvia
that
the
anxiety
the
awful
suspense
that
made
his
fingers
cold
as
he
opened
the
daily
papers
brought
into
it
to
her
an
echo
of
victorious
music
that
beat
to
the
tramp
of
advancing
feet
that
marched
ever
forward
leaving
the
glittering
rhine
leagues
upon
leagues
in
their
rear
the
bavarian
corps
in
which
hermann
served
was
known
to
be
somewhere
on
the
western
front
for
the
emperor
had
addressed
them
ten
days
before
on
their
departure
from
munich
and
sylvia
and
michael
were
both
aware
of
that
but
they
who
loved
hermann
best
could
not
speak
of
it
to
each
other
and
the
knowledge
of
it
had
to
be
hidden
in
silence
as
if
it
had
been
some
guilty
secret
in
which
they
were
the
terrified
accomplices
instead
of
its
being
a
bond
of
love
which
bound
them
both
to
hermann
in
addition
to
the
national
anxiety
there
was
the
suspense
of
those
whose
sons
and
husbands
and
fathers
were
in
the
fighting
line
columns
of
casualty
lists
were
published
and
each
name
appearing
there
was
a
sword
that
pierced
a
home
one
such
list
published
early
in
september
was
seen
by
michael
as
he
drove
down
on
sunday
morning
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
with
sylvia
and
the
first
name
that
he
read
there
was
that
of
francis
for
a
moment
as
he
remembered
afterwards
the
print
had
danced
before
his
eyes
as
if
seen
through
the
quiver
of
hot
air
then
it
settled
down
and
he
saw
it
clearly
he
turned
and
drove
back
to
his
rooms
in
half
moon
street
feeling
that
strange
craving
for
loneliness
that
shuns
any
companionship
he
must
for
a
little
sit
alone
with
the
fact
face
it
adjust
himself
to
it
till
that
moment
when
the
dancing
print
grew
still
again
he
had
not
in
all
the
anxiety
and
suspense
of
those
days
thought
of
francis
s
death
as
a
possibility
even
he
had
heard
from
him
only
two
mornings
before
in
a
letter
thoroughly
characteristic
that
saw
as
francis
always
saw
the
pleasant
and
agreeable
side
of
things
washing
he
had
announced
was
a
delusion
after
a
week
without
it
you
began
to
wonder
why
you
had
ever
made
a
habit
of
it
they
had
had
a
lot
of
marching
always
in
the
wrong
direction
but
everyone
knew
that
would
soon
be
over
wasn
t
london
very
beastly
in
august
would
michael
see
if
he
could
get
some
proper
cigarettes
out
to
him
here
there
was
nothing
but
little
black
french
affairs
and
not
many
of
them
which
tied
a
knot
in
the
throat
of
the
smoker
and
now
francis
with
all
his
gaiety
and
his
affection
and
his
light
pleasant
dealings
with
life
lay
dead
somewhere
on
the
sunny
plains
of
france
killed
in
action
by
shell
or
bullet
in
the
midst
of
his
youth
and
strength
and
joy
in
life
to
gratify
the
damned
dreams
of
the
man
who
had
been
the
honoured
guest
at
ashbridge
and
those
who
had
advised
and
flattered
and
at
the
end
perhaps
just
used
him
as
their
dupe
to
their
insensate
greed
and
lust
for
was
this
hecatomb
of
sweet
and
pleasant
lives
offered
and
in
their
onward
course
through
the
vines
and
corn
of
france
they
waded
through
the
blood
of
the
slain
whose
only
crime
was
that
they
had
dared
to
oppose
the
will
of
germany
as
voiced
by
the
war
lord
and
as
milestones
along
the
way
they
had
come
were
set
the
records
of
their
infamy
in
rapine
and
ruthless
slaughter
of
the
innocent
just
at
first
as
he
sat
alone
in
his
room
michael
but
contemplated
images
that
seemed
to
form
in
his
mind
without
his
volition
and
from
the
shock
they
seemed
external
to
him
sometimes
he
had
a
vision
of
francis
lying
without
mark
or
wound
or
violence
on
him
in
some
vineyard
on
the
with
face
as
quiet
as
in
sleep
turned
towards
a
moonlit
sky
then
came
another
picture
and
francis
was
walking
across
the
terrace
at
ashbridge
with
his
gun
over
his
shoulder
towards
lord
ashbridge
and
the
emperor
who
stood
together
just
as
michael
had
seen
the
three
of
them
when
they
came
in
from
the
as
francis
came
near
the
emperor
put
a
cartridge
into
his
gun
and
shot
him
yes
that
was
it
that
was
what
had
happened
the
marvellous
peacemaker
of
europe
the
who
as
hermann
had
said
was
ready
to
put
out
all
conflagrations
the
fatuous
mountebank
who
pretended
to
be
a
friend
to
england
who
conducted
his
own
balderdash
which
he
called
music
had
changed
his
role
and
shown
his
black
heart
and
was
out
to
kill
wild
panoramas
like
these
streamed
through
michael
s
head
as
if
projected
there
by
some
magic
lantern
and
while
they
lasted
he
was
conscious
of
no
grief
at
all
but
only
of
a
devouring
hate
for
the
mad
lawless
butchers
who
had
caused
francis
s
death
and
willingly
at
that
moment
if
he
could
have
gone
out
into
the
night
and
killed
a
german
and
met
his
death
himself
in
the
doing
of
it
he
would
have
gone
to
his
doom
as
to
a
but
by
degrees
as
the
stress
of
these
unsought
imaginings
abated
his
thoughts
turned
to
francis
himself
again
who
through
all
his
boyhood
and
early
manhood
had
been
to
him
a
sort
of
ideal
and
inspiration
how
he
had
loved
and
admired
him
yet
never
with
a
touch
of
jealousy
and
francis
whose
letter
lay
open
by
him
on
the
table
lay
dead
on
the
battlefields
of
france
there
was
the
envelope
with
the
red
square
mark
of
the
censor
upon
it
and
the
sheet
with
its
gay
scrawl
in
pencil
asking
for
proper
cigarettes
and
with
a
pang
of
remorse
all
the
more
vivid
because
it
concerned
so
trivial
a
thing
michael
recollected
that
he
had
not
sent
them
he
had
meant
to
do
so
yesterday
afternoon
but
something
had
put
it
out
of
his
head
never
again
would
francis
ask
him
to
send
out
cigarettes
michael
laid
his
head
on
his
arms
so
that
his
face
was
close
to
that
pencilled
note
and
the
relief
of
tears
came
to
him
soon
he
raised
himself
again
not
ashamed
of
his
sorrow
but
somehow
ashamed
of
the
black
hate
that
before
had
filled
him
that
was
gone
for
the
present
anyhow
and
michael
was
glad
to
find
it
vanished
instead
there
was
an
aching
pity
not
for
francis
alone
nor
for
himself
but
for
all
those
concerned
in
this
hideous
business
a
hundred
and
a
thousand
homes
thrown
suddenly
into
mourning
were
there
no
doubt
there
were
houses
in
that
bavarian
village
in
the
pine
woods
above
which
he
and
hermann
had
spent
the
day
when
there
was
no
opera
at
baireuth
where
a
son
or
a
brother
or
a
father
were
mourned
and
in
the
kinship
of
sorrow
he
found
himself
at
peace
with
all
who
had
suffered
loss
with
all
who
were
living
through
days
of
deadly
suspense
there
was
nothing
effeminate
or
sentimental
about
it
he
had
never
been
manlier
than
in
this
moment
when
he
claimed
his
right
to
be
one
with
them
it
was
right
to
pause
like
this
with
his
hand
clasped
in
the
hands
of
friends
and
foes
alike
but
without
disowning
that
he
knew
that
francis
s
death
which
had
brought
that
home
to
him
had
made
him
eager
also
for
his
own
turn
to
come
when
he
would
go
out
to
help
in
the
grim
work
that
lay
in
front
of
him
he
was
perfectly
ready
to
die
if
necessary
and
if
not
to
kill
as
many
germans
as
possible
and
somehow
the
two
aspects
of
it
all
the
pity
and
the
desire
to
kill
existed
side
by
side
neither
overlapping
nor
contradicting
one
another
his
servant
came
into
the
room
with
a
pencilled
note
which
he
opened
it
was
from
sylvia
oh
michael
i
have
just
called
and
am
waiting
to
know
if
you
will
see
me
i
have
seen
the
news
and
i
want
to
tell
you
how
sorry
i
am
but
if
you
don
t
care
to
see
me
i
know
you
will
say
so
won
t
you
though
an
hour
before
he
had
turned
back
on
his
way
to
go
to
sylvia
he
did
not
hesitate
now
yes
ask
miss
falbe
to
come
up
he
said
she
came
up
immediately
and
once
again
as
they
met
the
world
and
the
war
stood
apart
from
them
i
did
not
expect
you
to
come
michael
she
said
when
i
saw
the
news
i
did
not
mean
to
come
here
myself
but
but
i
had
to
i
had
just
to
find
out
whether
you
wouldn
t
see
me
and
let
me
tell
you
how
sorry
i
he
smiled
at
her
as
they
stood
facing
each
other
thank
you
for
coming
he
said
i
m
so
glad
you
came
but
i
had
to
be
alone
just
a
i
didn
t
do
wrong
she
asked
indeed
you
didn
t
i
did
wrong
not
to
come
to
you
i
loved
francis
you
already
the
shadow
threatened
again
it
was
just
the
fact
that
he
loved
francis
that
had
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
go
to
her
and
he
could
not
explain
that
and
as
the
shadow
began
to
fall
she
gave
a
little
shudder
oh
michael
i
know
you
did
she
said
it
s
just
that
which
concerns
us
that
and
my
sympathy
for
you
he
was
such
a
dear
i
only
saw
him
i
know
once
or
twice
but
from
that
i
can
guess
what
he
was
to
you
he
was
a
brother
to
you
a
a
michael
felt
with
sylvia
s
hand
in
his
they
were
both
running
desperately
away
from
the
shadow
that
pursued
them
desperately
he
tried
with
her
to
evade
it
but
every
word
spoken
between
them
seemed
but
to
bring
it
nearer
to
them
i
only
came
to
say
that
she
said
i
had
to
tell
you
myself
to
see
you
as
i
told
you
so
that
you
could
know
how
sincere
how
heartfelt
she
stopped
suddenly
that
s
all
my
dearest
she
added
i
will
go
away
again
across
that
shadow
that
had
again
fallen
between
them
they
looked
and
yearned
for
each
other
no
don
t
go
don
t
go
he
said
i
want
you
more
than
ever
we
are
here
here
and
now
you
and
i
and
what
else
matters
in
comparison
of
that
i
loved
francis
as
you
know
and
i
love
hermann
but
there
is
our
love
the
greatest
thing
of
all
we
ve
got
it
it
s
here
oh
sylvia
we
must
be
wise
and
simple
we
must
separate
things
sort
them
out
not
let
them
get
mixed
with
one
another
we
can
do
it
i
know
we
can
there
s
nothing
outside
us
nothing
matters
nothing
there
was
just
that
ray
of
sun
peering
over
the
black
cloud
that
illumined
their
faces
to
each
other
while
already
the
sharp
peaked
shadow
of
it
had
come
between
them
for
that
second
while
he
spoke
it
seemed
possible
that
in
the
middle
of
welter
and
chaos
and
death
and
enmity
these
two
souls
could
stand
apart
in
the
passionate
serene
of
love
and
the
moment
lasted
for
just
as
long
as
she
flung
herself
into
his
arms
and
then
even
while
her
face
was
pressed
to
his
and
while
the
riotous
blood
of
their
pressed
lips
sang
to
them
the
shadow
fell
across
them
even
as
he
asserted
the
inviolability
of
the
sanctuary
in
which
they
stood
he
knew
it
to
be
an
impossible
utopia
that
he
should
find
with
her
the
peace
that
should
secure
them
from
the
raging
storm
the
cold
shadow
and
the
loosening
of
her
arms
about
his
neck
but
endorsed
the
message
of
his
own
heart
for
such
heavenly
security
can
not
come
except
to
those
who
have
been
through
the
ultimate
bitterness
that
the
world
can
bring
it
is
not
arrived
at
but
through
complete
surrender
to
the
trial
of
fire
and
as
yet
in
spite
of
their
opposed
patriotism
in
spite
of
her
sincerest
sympathy
with
michael
s
loss
the
assault
on
the
most
intimate
lines
of
the
fortress
had
not
yet
been
delivered
before
they
could
reach
the
peace
that
passed
understanding
a
fiercer
attack
had
to
be
repulsed
they
had
to
stand
and
look
at
each
other
unembittered
across
waves
and
billows
of
a
salter
marah
than
this
but
still
they
clung
while
in
their
eyes
there
passed
backwards
and
forwards
the
message
that
said
it
is
not
yet
it
is
not
thus
they
had
been
like
two
children
springing
together
at
the
report
of
some
not
knowing
in
the
presence
of
what
elemental
outpouring
of
force
they
hid
their
faces
together
as
yet
it
but
boomed
on
the
horizon
though
messages
of
its
havoc
reached
them
and
the
test
would
come
when
it
roared
and
lightened
overhead
already
the
tension
of
the
approaching
tempest
had
so
wrought
on
them
that
for
a
month
past
they
had
been
unreal
to
each
other
wanting
ease
wanting
confidence
and
now
when
the
first
real
shock
had
come
though
for
a
moment
it
threw
them
into
each
other
s
arms
this
was
not
as
they
knew
the
real
the
final
reconciliation
the
touchstone
that
proved
the
gold
francis
s
death
the
cousin
whom
michael
loved
at
the
hands
of
one
of
the
nation
to
whom
sylvia
belonged
had
momentarily
made
them
feel
that
all
else
but
their
love
was
but
external
circumstance
and
even
in
the
moment
of
their
feeling
this
the
shadow
fell
again
and
left
them
chilly
and
shivering
for
a
moment
they
still
held
each
other
round
the
neck
and
shoulder
then
the
hold
slipped
to
the
elbow
and
soon
their
hands
parted
as
yet
no
word
had
been
said
since
michael
asserted
that
nothing
else
mattered
and
in
the
silence
of
their
gradual
estrangement
the
sanguine
falsity
of
that
grew
and
grew
and
grew
i
know
what
you
feel
she
said
at
length
and
i
feel
it
her
voice
broke
and
her
hands
felt
for
his
again
michael
where
are
you
she
cried
no
don
t
touch
me
i
didn
t
mean
that
let
s
face
it
for
all
we
know
hermann
might
have
killed
francis
whether
he
did
or
not
doesn
t
matter
it
might
have
been
it
s
like
a
minute
before
michael
in
soul
and
blood
and
mind
and
bones
had
said
that
nothing
but
sylvia
and
himself
had
any
real
existence
he
had
clung
to
her
even
as
she
to
him
hoping
that
this
individual
love
would
prove
itself
capable
of
overriding
all
else
that
existed
but
it
had
not
needed
that
she
should
speak
to
show
him
how
pathetically
he
had
erred
before
she
had
made
a
concrete
instance
he
knew
how
hopeless
his
wish
had
been
the
silence
the
loosening
of
hands
had
told
him
that
and
when
she
spoke
there
was
a
brutality
in
what
she
said
and
worse
than
the
brutality
there
was
a
plain
unvarnished
truth
there
was
no
question
now
of
her
going
away
at
once
as
she
had
proposed
any
more
than
a
boat
in
the
rapids
roared
round
by
breakers
can
propose
to
start
again
they
were
in
the
middle
of
it
and
so
short
a
way
ahead
was
the
cataract
that
ran
with
blood
on
each
side
at
present
were
fine
green
he
at
the
oar
she
at
the
tiller
could
if
they
were
of
one
mind
still
put
ashore
could
run
their
boat
in
declining
the
passage
of
the
cataract
with
all
its
risks
its
river
of
blood
there
was
but
a
stroke
of
the
oar
to
be
made
a
pull
on
a
rope
of
the
rudder
and
a
step
ashore
here
was
a
way
out
of
the
storm
and
the
rapids
a
moment
before
when
by
their
physical
parting
they
had
realised
the
strength
of
the
bonds
that
held
them
apart
this
solution
had
not
occurred
to
sylvia
now
critically
and
forlornly
hopeful
it
flashed
on
her
she
felt
she
almost
felt
for
the
ultimate
decision
rested
with
him
that
with
him
she
would
throw
everything
else
aside
and
escape
just
escape
if
so
he
willed
it
into
some
haven
of
neutrality
where
he
and
she
would
be
together
leaving
the
rest
of
the
world
her
country
and
his
to
fight
over
these
irreconcilable
quarrels
it
did
not
seem
to
matter
what
happened
to
anybody
else
provided
only
she
and
michael
were
together
out
of
risk
out
of
harm
other
lives
might
be
precious
other
ideals
and
patriotisms
might
be
at
stake
but
she
wanted
to
be
with
him
and
nothing
else
at
all
no
tie
counted
compared
to
that
there
was
but
one
life
given
to
man
and
woman
and
now
that
her
individual
happiness
the
individual
joy
of
her
love
was
at
stake
she
felt
even
as
michael
had
said
that
nothing
else
mattered
that
they
would
be
right
to
realise
themselves
at
any
cost
she
took
his
hands
again
listen
to
me
michael
she
said
i
can
t
bear
any
longer
that
these
horrors
should
keep
rising
up
between
us
and
while
we
are
here
in
the
middle
of
it
all
it
can
t
be
otherwise
i
ask
you
then
to
come
away
with
me
to
leave
it
all
behind
it
is
not
our
quarrel
already
hermann
has
gone
i
can
t
lose
you
she
looked
up
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
quickly
away
again
for
she
felt
her
case
which
seemed
to
her
just
now
so
imperative
slipping
away
from
her
in
that
glance
she
got
of
his
eyes
that
for
all
the
love
that
burned
there
were
blank
with
astonishment
she
must
convince
him
but
her
own
convictions
were
weak
when
she
looked
at
him
don
t
answer
me
yet
she
said
hear
what
i
have
to
say
don
t
you
see
that
while
we
are
like
this
we
are
lost
to
each
other
and
as
you
yourself
said
just
now
nothing
matters
in
comparison
to
our
love
i
want
you
to
take
me
away
out
of
it
all
so
that
we
can
find
each
other
again
these
horrors
thwart
and
warp
us
they
spoil
the
best
thing
that
the
world
holds
for
us
my
patriotism
is
just
as
sound
as
yours
but
i
throw
it
away
to
get
you
do
the
same
then
you
can
get
out
of
your
service
somehow
and
then
her
voice
began
to
falter
if
you
loved
me
you
would
do
it
she
said
if
and
then
suddenly
she
found
she
could
say
no
more
at
all
she
had
hoped
that
when
she
stated
these
things
she
would
convince
him
and
behold
all
she
had
done
was
to
shake
her
own
convictions
so
that
they
fell
clattering
round
her
like
an
unstable
desperately
she
looked
again
at
him
wondering
if
she
had
convinced
him
at
all
and
then
again
she
looked
wondering
if
she
should
see
contempt
in
his
eyes
after
that
she
stood
still
and
silent
and
her
face
flamed
do
you
despise
me
michael
she
said
he
gave
a
little
sigh
of
utter
content
oh
my
dear
how
i
love
you
for
suggesting
such
a
sweet
impossibility
he
said
but
how
you
would
despise
me
if
i
she
did
not
answer
wouldn
t
you
he
repeated
she
gave
a
sorrowful
semblance
of
a
laugh
i
suppose
i
should
she
said
and
i
know
you
would
you
would
contrast
me
in
your
mind
whether
you
wished
to
or
not
with
hermann
with
poor
francis
sorely
to
my
they
sat
silent
a
little
but
there
was
another
question
sylvia
had
to
ask
for
which
she
had
to
collect
her
courage
at
last
it
came
have
they
told
you
yet
when
you
are
going
she
said
not
for
certain
but
it
will
be
before
many
days
are
passed
and
the
question
arises
will
you
marry
me
before
i
go
she
hid
her
face
on
his
shoulder
i
will
do
what
you
wish
she
said
but
i
want
to
know
your
she
clung
closer
to
him
michael
i
don
t
think
i
could
bear
to
part
with
you
if
we
were
married
she
said
it
would
be
worse
i
think
than
it
s
going
to
be
but
i
intend
to
do
exactly
what
you
wish
you
must
tell
me
i
m
going
to
obey
you
before
i
am
your
wife
as
well
as
michael
had
long
debated
this
in
his
mind
it
seemed
to
him
that
if
he
came
back
as
might
easily
happen
hopelessly
crippled
incurably
invalid
it
would
be
placing
sylvia
in
an
unfairly
difficult
position
if
she
was
already
his
wife
he
might
be
hideously
disfigured
she
would
be
bound
to
but
a
wreck
of
a
man
he
might
be
utterly
unfit
to
be
her
husband
and
yet
she
would
be
tied
to
him
he
had
already
talked
the
question
over
with
his
father
who
with
that
curious
posthumous
anxiety
to
have
a
further
direct
heir
had
urged
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
at
once
but
with
his
own
feeling
on
the
subject
as
well
as
sylvia
s
he
at
once
made
up
his
mind
i
agree
with
you
he
said
we
will
settle
it
so
she
smiled
at
him
how
dreadfully
she
said
with
an
attempt
at
lightness
i
know
it
s
rather
a
good
thing
one
has
got
to
be
when
that
failed
also
and
he
drew
her
to
him
and
kissed
her

michael
was
sitting
in
the
kitchen
of
a
french
just
outside
the
village
of
laires
some
three
miles
behind
the
english
front
the
kitchen
door
was
open
and
on
the
flagged
floor
was
cast
an
oblong
of
november
sunshine
warm
and
pleasant
so
that
the
bluebottle
flies
buzzed
hopefully
about
it
settling
occasionally
on
the
cracked
green
door
where
they
cleaned
their
wings
and
generally
furbished
themselves
up
as
if
the
warmth
was
that
of
a
spring
day
that
promised
summer
to
follow
they
were
there
in
considerable
numbers
for
just
outside
in
the
cobbled
yard
was
a
heap
of
manure
where
they
hungrily
congregated
against
the
wall
of
the
house
there
lay
a
fat
sow
basking
contentedly
and
snorting
in
her
dreams
the
yard
bounded
on
two
sides
by
the
house
walls
was
shut
in
on
the
third
by
a
row
of
and
the
fourth
was
open
just
outside
it
stood
a
small
copse
half
flooded
with
the
brimming
water
of
a
sluggish
stream
that
meandered
by
the
side
of
the
leading
out
of
the
yard
which
turned
to
the
left
and
soon
joined
the
highway
this
was
partly
under
water
though
not
deeply
so
that
by
skirting
along
its
raised
banks
it
was
possible
to
go
to
the
highway
underneath
which
the
stream
passed
in
a
brick
culvert
through
the
kitchen
window
set
opposite
the
door
could
be
seen
a
broad
stretch
of
country
of
the
fenland
type
flat
and
bare
and
intersected
with
dykes
where
sedges
stirred
slightly
in
the
southerly
breeze
here
and
there
were
pools
of
overflowed
rivulets
and
here
and
there
were
plantations
of
stunted
hornbeam
the
russet
leaves
of
which
still
clung
thickly
to
them
but
in
the
main
it
was
a
bare
and
empty
land
featureless
and
stolid
just
below
the
kitchen
window
there
was
a
plot
of
cultivated
ground
thriftily
and
economically
used
for
the
growing
of
vegetables
concession
however
was
made
to
the
sense
of
brightness
and
beauty
for
on
each
side
of
the
path
leading
up
to
the
door
ran
a
row
of
michaelmas
daisies
rather
battered
by
the
fortnight
of
rain
which
had
preceded
this
day
of
still
warm
sun
but
struggling
bravely
to
shake
off
the
effect
of
the
adverse
conditions
under
which
they
had
laboured
the
kitchen
itself
was
extremely
clean
and
orderly
its
flagged
floor
was
still
damp
and
brown
in
patches
from
the
washing
it
had
received
two
hours
before
but
the
draught
between
open
window
and
open
door
was
fast
drying
it
down
the
centre
of
the
room
was
a
deal
table
without
a
cloth
on
which
were
laid
some
places
each
marked
with
a
knife
and
fork
and
spoon
and
a
thick
glass
ready
for
the
serving
of
the
midday
meal
on
the
walls
hung
two
photographs
of
family
groups
in
one
of
which
appeared
the
father
and
mother
and
three
little
children
in
the
other
the
same
personages
some
ten
years
later
and
a
lithograph
of
the
blessed
virgin
on
each
side
of
the
table
was
a
deal
bench
at
the
head
and
foot
two
wooden
armchairs
a
dresser
stood
against
the
wall
on
the
floor
by
the
oven
was
a
frayed
rug
and
most
important
of
all
to
michael
s
mind
was
a
big
stewpot
that
stood
on
the
top
of
the
oven
from
time
to
time
a
fat
comfortable
frenchwoman
bustled
in
and
took
off
the
lid
of
this
to
stir
it
or
placed
on
the
dresser
a
plate
of
cheese
or
a
loaf
of
freshly
cooked
brown
bread
two
or
three
of
michael
s
were
there
one
sitting
in
the
patch
of
sunlight
with
his
back
against
the
green
door
another
on
the
step
outside
the
post
had
come
in
not
long
before
and
all
of
them
michael
included
were
occupied
with
letters
and
papers
there
happened
to
be
no
letters
for
michael
and
the
paper
which
he
glanced
at
seemed
a
very
feeble
effort
in
the
way
of
entertainment
there
was
no
news
in
it
except
news
about
the
war
which
here
out
at
the
front
did
not
interest
him
in
the
least
perhaps
in
england
people
liked
to
know
that
a
hundred
yards
of
trenches
had
been
taken
at
one
place
and
that
three
german
attacks
had
failed
at
another
but
when
you
were
actually
engaged
or
had
been
or
would
soon
again
be
in
taking
part
in
those
things
it
seemed
a
waste
of
paper
and
compositor
s
time
to
record
them
there
was
a
column
of
letters
also
from
indignant
britons
using
violent
language
about
the
crimes
and
treachery
of
germany
that
also
was
uninteresting
and
nothing
that
germany
had
done
mattered
the
least
there
was
no
use
in
arguing
and
slinging
wild
expressions
about
it
was
a
stale
subject
altogether
when
you
were
within
earshot
of
that
incessant
booming
of
guns
all
the
morning
that
had
gone
on
without
break
and
no
doubt
they
would
get
news
of
what
had
happened
before
they
set
out
again
that
evening
for
another
spell
in
the
trenches
but
in
all
probability
nothing
particular
had
happened
probably
the
london
papers
would
record
it
next
day
a
further
tediousness
on
their
part
it
would
be
much
more
interesting
to
hear
what
was
going
on
there
whether
there
were
any
new
plays
whether
there
had
been
any
fresh
concerts
what
the
weather
was
like
or
even
who
had
been
lunching
at
prince
s
or
dining
at
the
carlton
he
put
down
his
uninteresting
paper
and
strolled
out
into
the
farmyard
stepping
over
the
legs
of
the
junior
officer
who
blocked
the
doorway
and
did
not
attempt
to
move
on
the
doorstep
was
sitting
a
major
of
his
regiment
who
more
politely
shifted
his
place
a
little
so
that
michael
should
pass
outside
the
smell
of
manure
was
acrid
but
not
unpleasant
the
old
sow
grunted
in
her
sleep
and
one
of
the
green
shutters
outside
the
upper
windows
slowly
blew
to
there
was
someone
inside
the
room
apparently
for
the
moment
after
a
hand
and
arm
bare
to
the
elbow
were
protruded
and
fastened
the
latch
of
the
shutter
so
that
it
should
not
move
again
a
little
further
on
was
a
rail
that
separated
the
copse
from
the
roadway
and
here
out
of
the
wind
michael
sat
down
and
lit
a
cigarette
to
stop
his
yearning
for
the
bubbling
stewpot
which
would
not
be
broached
for
half
an
hour
yet
the
day
he
believed
was
wednesday
but
the
whole
quiet
of
the
place
apart
from
that
drowsy
booming
on
the
eastern
horizon
made
it
feel
like
sunday
nobody
but
the
fat
frenchwoman
who
bustled
about
had
anything
to
do
there
was
a
sabbath
leisure
about
everything
about
the
dozing
sow
the
buzzing
flies
the
lounging
figures
that
read
letters
and
papers
when
last
they
were
here
it
is
true
there
were
rather
more
of
them
eight
officers
had
been
billeted
here
last
week
before
they
had
been
in
the
trenches
and
now
there
were
but
six
this
evening
they
would
set
out
again
for
another
hours
in
that
hellish
inferno
but
a
fresh
draft
was
arriving
so
that
when
next
they
foregathered
here
whatever
had
happened
in
the
interval
there
would
probably
be
at
least
six
of
them
it
did
not
seem
to
matter
much
what
six
there
would
be
or
whether
there
would
be
more
than
six
or
less
all
that
mattered
at
this
moment
as
he
inhaled
the
first
incense
of
his
cigarette
was
that
the
rain
was
over
for
the
present
that
the
sun
shone
from
a
blue
sky
that
he
felt
extraordinarily
well
and
tranquil
and
that
dinner
would
soon
be
ready
but
of
all
these
agreeable
things
what
pleased
him
most
was
the
tranquillity
to
be
alive
here
with
the
manure
heap
steaming
in
the
sun
and
the
sow
asleep
by
the
house
wall
and
swallows
settling
on
the
eaves
was
paradise
somewhere
deep
down
in
him
were
streams
of
yearning
and
of
horror
flowing
like
an
underground
river
in
the
dark
he
yearned
for
sylvia
he
thought
with
horror
of
the
two
days
in
the
trenches
that
had
preceded
this
rest
in
the
and
with
horror
he
thought
of
the
days
and
nights
that
would
succeed
it
but
both
horror
and
yearnings
were
stupefied
by
the
content
that
flooded
the
present
moment
no
doubt
it
was
reaction
from
what
had
gone
before
but
the
reaction
was
complete
just
now
he
asked
for
nothing
but
to
sit
in
the
sun
and
smoke
his
cigarette
and
wait
for
dinner
as
far
as
he
knew
he
did
not
think
of
anything
particular
he
just
existed
in
the
sun
the
wind
must
have
shifted
a
little
for
before
long
it
came
round
the
corner
of
the
house
and
slightly
spoiled
the
mellow
warmth
of
the
sunshine
this
would
never
do
the
epicurean
in
him
revolted
at
the
idea
of
losing
a
moment
of
this
complete
and
arguing
that
if
the
wind
blew
here
it
must
be
dead
calm
below
the
kitchen
window
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
he
got
off
his
rail
and
walked
along
the
slippery
bank
at
the
edge
of
the
flooded
road
in
order
to
go
there
it
was
hard
to
keep
his
footing
here
and
his
progress
was
slow
but
he
felt
he
would
take
any
amount
of
trouble
to
avoid
getting
his
feet
wet
in
the
flooded
road
then
there
was
a
patch
of
to
cross
where
the
mud
clung
rather
annoyingly
to
his
instep
and
having
gained
the
garden
path
he
very
carefully
wiped
his
boots
and
with
a
fallen
twig
dug
away
the
clots
of
soil
that
stuck
to
the
instep
he
found
that
he
had
been
quite
right
in
supposing
that
the
air
would
be
windless
here
and
full
of
great
content
he
sat
down
with
his
back
to
the
house
wall
a
butterfly
encouraged
by
the
warmth
was
flitting
about
among
the
michaelmas
daisies
that
bordered
the
path
and
settling
on
them
opening
its
wings
to
the
genial
sun
two
or
three
bees
buzzed
there
also
the
tranquillity
inserted
into
the
middle
of
november
squalls
and
rain
deluded
them
as
well
as
michael
into
living
completely
in
the
present
hour
gnats
hovered
about
one
settled
on
michael
s
hand
where
he
instantly
killed
it
and
was
sorry
he
had
done
so
for
the
time
the
booming
of
guns
which
had
sounded
incessantly
all
the
morning
to
the
east
stopped
altogether
and
absolute
quiet
reigned
had
he
not
been
so
hungry
and
so
unable
to
get
the
idea
of
the
stewpot
out
of
his
head
michael
would
have
been
content
to
sit
with
his
back
to
the
wall
for
ever
the
raised
and
embanked
above
the
fields
ran
eastwards
in
an
undeviating
straight
line
just
opposite
the
farm
were
the
last
outlying
huts
of
the
village
and
from
there
onwards
it
lay
untenanted
but
before
many
minutes
were
passed
the
quiet
of
the
autumn
noon
began
to
be
overscored
by
distant
humming
faint
at
first
and
then
quickly
growing
louder
and
he
saw
far
away
a
little
brown
speck
coming
swiftly
towards
him
it
turned
out
to
be
a
mounted
on
a
who
with
a
hoot
of
his
horn
roared
westward
through
the
village
immediately
afterwards
another
humming
steadier
and
more
sonorous
grew
louder
and
michael
recognising
it
looked
up
instinctively
into
the
blue
sky
overhead
as
an
english
aeroplane
flying
low
came
from
somewhere
behind
and
passed
directly
over
him
going
eastwards
before
long
it
stopped
its
direct
course
and
began
to
mount
in
spirals
and
when
at
a
sufficient
height
it
resumed
its
onward
journey
towards
the
german
lines
then
three
or
four
privates
billeted
in
the
village
and
now
resting
after
duty
in
the
trenches
strolled
along
the
road
laughing
and
talking
they
sat
down
not
a
hundred
yards
from
michael
and
one
began
to
whistle
another
and
another
took
it
up
until
all
four
were
engaged
on
it
it
was
not
precisely
in
tune
nor
were
the
performers
in
unison
but
it
produced
a
vaguely
pleasant
effect
and
if
not
in
tune
with
the
notes
as
the
composer
wrote
them
the
sight
and
sound
of
those
four
whistling
and
idle
soldiers
was
in
tune
with
the
air
of
security
of
sunday
morning
something
far
down
the
road
caught
michael
s
eye
some
moving
line
of
brown
wagons
as
they
came
nearer
he
saw
that
they
were
the
of
the
red
cross
moving
slowly
along
the
ruts
and
holes
which
the
traffic
had
worn
so
that
the
occupants
should
suffer
as
little
jolting
as
was
possible
they
carried
no
doubt
the
wounded
who
had
been
taken
from
the
trenches
last
night
and
now
after
calling
for
them
at
the
first
dressing
station
in
the
rear
of
the
lines
were
removing
them
to
hospital
as
they
passed
the
four
men
sitting
by
the
roadside
one
of
them
shouted
cheer
oh
mates
and
then
they
fell
to
whistling
tipperary
again
then
oh
blessed
moment
the
fat
frenchwoman
looked
out
of
the
kitchen
window
just
above
his
head
diner
m
sieu
she
said
and
michael
without
another
thought
of
ambulance
or
aeroplane
scrambled
to
his
feet
somewhere
in
the
middle
distance
of
his
mind
he
was
sorry
that
this
tranquil
morning
was
over
just
as
below
in
the
darkness
of
it
there
ran
those
streams
of
yearning
and
of
horror
but
all
his
ordinary
self
was
occupied
with
the
immediate
prospect
of
the
stewpot
it
was
some
sort
of
a
ragout
he
knew
and
he
lusted
for
it
red
wine
of
the
country
would
be
there
and
cheese
and
new
brown
bread
it
surprised
him
to
find
how
completely
his
bodily
needs
and
the
pleasure
of
their
gratification
had
possession
of
him
they
were
under
orders
to
go
back
to
the
trenches
shortly
after
sunset
and
when
their
meal
was
over
there
remained
but
an
hour
or
two
before
they
had
to
start
the
warmth
and
glory
of
the
day
was
already
gone
and
streamers
of
cloud
were
beginning
to
form
over
the
open
sky
all
afternoon
these
thickened
till
a
dull
layer
of
grey
had
thickly
overspread
the
heavens
and
below
that
arch
of
vapour
that
cut
off
the
sun
the
wind
was
blowing
chilly
with
that
change
in
the
weather
michael
s
mood
changed
also
and
the
horror
of
the
return
to
the
trenches
began
to
come
to
the
surface
he
was
not
as
yet
aware
of
any
physical
fear
of
death
or
of
wound
rather
the
feeling
was
one
of
some
mental
and
spiritual
shrinking
from
the
whole
of
this
vast
business
of
murder
where
hundreds
and
thousands
of
men
along
the
battle
front
that
stretched
across
europe
were
employed
day
and
night
without
having
any
quarrel
with
each
other
in
the
unsleeping
vigilant
work
of
killing
most
of
them
in
all
probability
were
quite
decent
fellows
like
those
four
who
had
whistled
tipperary
together
and
yet
they
were
spending
months
of
young
sweet
life
up
to
the
knees
in
water
in
foul
and
trenches
in
order
to
kill
others
whom
they
had
never
seen
except
as
specks
on
the
sights
of
their
rifles
somewhere
behind
that
gruesome
business
as
he
knew
there
stood
the
cause
calm
and
serene
like
some
great
statue
which
made
this
insensate
murdering
necessary
but
just
for
an
hour
as
he
waited
till
they
had
to
be
on
the
move
again
he
found
himself
unable
to
make
real
to
his
own
mind
the
existence
of
that
cause
and
could
not
see
beyond
the
bloody
and
hideous
things
that
resulted
from
it
then
in
this
inaction
of
waiting
an
attack
of
mere
physical
cowardice
seized
him
and
he
found
himself
imagining
the
mutilation
and
torture
that
perhaps
awaited
him
personally
in
those
deathly
ditches
he
tried
to
busy
himself
with
the
preparation
of
the
few
things
that
he
would
take
with
him
he
tried
to
encourage
himself
by
remembering
that
in
his
previous
experiences
there
he
had
not
been
conscious
of
any
fear
by
telling
himself
that
these
were
only
the
unreal
anticipations
that
were
always
ready
to
pounce
on
one
even
before
such
mildly
alarming
affairs
as
a
visit
to
the
dentist
but
in
spite
of
his
efforts
he
found
his
hands
growing
clammy
and
cold
at
the
thoughts
which
beset
his
brain
what
if
there
happened
to
him
what
had
happened
to
another
junior
officer
who
was
close
to
him
at
the
moment
when
a
fragment
of
shell
turned
him
from
a
big
gay
boy
into
a
writhing
bundle
at
the
bottom
of
the
trench
he
had
lived
for
a
couple
of
hours
like
that
moaning
and
crying
out
for
god
s
sake
kill
me
what
if
more
mercifully
he
was
killed
outright
so
that
he
would
lie
there
in
peace
till
next
night
they
removed
his
body
or
perhaps
had
to
bury
him
in
the
trench
itself
with
a
dozen
handfuls
of
soil
cast
over
him
at
that
he
suddenly
realised
how
passionately
he
wanted
to
live
to
escape
from
this
infernal
butchery
to
be
safe
again
gloriously
or
ingloriously
it
mattered
not
which
to
be
with
sylvia
once
more
he
told
himself
that
he
had
been
an
utter
fool
ever
to
the
army
again
like
this
he
could
certainly
have
got
some
appointment
as
or
had
himself
attached
to
the
headquarters
staff
or
even
have
shuffled
out
of
it
altogether
but
above
all
he
wanted
sylvia
he
wanted
to
be
allowed
to
lead
the
ordinary
human
life
safely
and
securely
with
the
girl
he
loved
and
with
the
musical
pursuits
that
were
his
passion
he
had
hated
soldiering
in
times
of
peace
he
found
now
that
he
was
terrified
of
it
in
times
of
war
he
felt
physically
sick
as
with
cold
hands
and
trembling
knees
he
stood
and
waited
lighting
cigarettes
and
throwing
them
away
in
front
of
the
kitchen
fire
where
the
stewpot
was
already
bubbling
again
for
those
lucky
devils
who
would
return
here
the
major
of
his
company
was
sitting
in
the
window
watching
him
though
michael
was
unaware
of
it
suddenly
he
got
up
and
came
across
to
the
fire
and
put
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
don
t
mind
it
comber
he
said
quietly
we
all
get
a
touch
of
it
sometimes
but
you
ll
find
it
will
pass
all
right
it
s
the
waiting
doing
nothing
that
does
that
touched
michael
absolutely
in
the
right
place
thanks
awfully
sir
he
said
not
a
bit
but
it
s
damned
beastly
while
it
lasts
you
ll
be
all
right
when
we
move
don
t
forget
to
take
your
fur
coat
up
if
you
ve
got
one
we
shall
have
a
cold
just
after
sunset
they
set
out
marching
in
the
gathering
dusk
down
the
road
eastwards
where
in
a
mile
or
two
they
would
strike
the
huge
rabbit
warren
of
trenches
that
joined
the
french
line
to
the
north
and
south
once
or
twice
they
had
to
open
out
and
go
by
the
margin
of
the
road
to
let
ambulances
or
commissariat
wagon
go
by
but
there
was
but
little
traffic
here
as
the
main
lines
of
communication
lay
on
other
roads
high
above
them
scarcely
visible
in
the
dusk
an
english
aeroplane
droned
back
from
its
reconnaissance
and
once
there
was
the
order
given
to
scatter
over
the
fields
as
a
german
taube
passed
across
them
this
caused
much
laughter
and
chaff
among
the
men
and
michael
heard
one
say
dove
they
call
it
do
they
i
d
like
to
make
a
of
them
soon
they
scrambled
back
on
to
the
road
again
and
the
interminable
tipperary
was
resumed
in
whistle
and
song
michael
remembered
how
aunt
barbara
had
heard
it
at
a
and
had
spoken
of
it
as
a
new
and
catchy
tune
which
you
could
carry
away
with
you
nowadays
it
carried
you
away
it
had
become
the
audible
soul
of
the
british
army
the
trench
which
michael
s
company
were
to
occupy
for
the
next
hours
was
in
the
first
and
to
reach
it
they
had
to
pass
in
single
file
up
a
mile
of
communication
trenches
from
which
on
all
sides
like
a
vast
rabbit
warren
there
opened
out
other
galleries
and
passages
that
led
to
different
parts
of
this
of
the
lines
it
ran
not
in
a
straight
line
but
in
short
sections
with
angles
intervening
so
under
no
circumstances
could
any
considerable
length
of
it
be
enfiladed
and
was
lit
here
and
there
by
little
oil
lamps
placed
in
embrasures
in
one
or
other
wall
of
it
or
for
some
distance
at
a
time
it
was
dark
except
for
the
vague
twilight
of
the
cloudy
sky
overhead
then
again
as
they
approached
the
it
would
suddenly
become
intensely
bright
when
from
the
english
lines
or
from
those
of
the
germans
which
lay
not
more
than
two
hundred
yards
in
front
of
them
a
fireball
or
was
sent
up
that
caused
everything
it
shone
upon
to
leap
into
vivid
illumination
usually
when
this
happened
there
came
from
one
side
or
the
other
a
volley
of
rifle
shots
that
sounded
like
the
crack
of
and
once
or
twice
a
bullet
passed
over
their
heads
with
the
buzz
as
of
some
vicious
stinging
insect
here
and
there
where
the
bottom
lay
in
soft
and
clayey
soil
they
walked
through
mud
that
came
up
to
the
knee
and
each
foot
had
to
be
lifted
with
an
effort
and
was
set
free
with
a
smacking
suck
elsewhere
if
the
ground
was
gravelly
the
rain
which
for
two
days
previously
had
been
incessant
had
drained
off
and
the
going
was
easy
but
whether
the
path
lay
over
dry
or
soft
places
the
air
was
sick
with
some
stale
odour
which
the
breeze
that
swept
across
the
lines
from
the
could
not
carry
away
there
was
a
perpetual
pervading
reek
that
flowed
along
from
the
entrance
of
trenches
to
right
and
left
that
reminded
michael
of
the
smell
of
a
football
scrimmage
on
a
wet
day
laden
with
the
odours
of
sweat
and
dripping
clothes
and
something
deadlier
and
more
acrid
sometimes
they
passed
under
a
section
covered
in
with
boards
over
which
the
earth
and
clods
of
turf
had
been
replaced
so
that
reconnoitring
aeroplanes
should
not
so
easily
spy
it
out
and
here
from
dark
excavations
the
smell
hung
overpoweringly
now
and
then
the
ground
over
which
they
passed
yielded
uneasily
to
the
foot
where
lay
only
lightly
covered
over
some
corpse
which
it
had
been
impossible
to
remove
and
from
time
to
time
they
passed
a
huddled
bundle
of
khaki
not
yet
taken
away
but
except
for
the
artillery
duel
that
day
they
had
heard
going
on
that
morning
the
last
day
or
two
had
been
quiet
and
the
wounded
had
all
been
got
out
and
for
the
most
part
the
dead
also
after
a
long
tramp
in
this
communication
trench
they
made
a
sharp
turn
to
the
right
and
entered
that
which
they
were
going
to
hold
for
the
next
hours
here
they
relieved
the
regiment
that
had
occupied
it
till
now
who
filed
out
as
they
came
in
along
it
at
intervals
were
excavations
dug
out
in
the
side
some
propped
up
with
boards
and
posts
others
where
the
ground
was
of
sufficiently
holding
character
just
scooped
out
in
front
towards
the
german
lines
ran
a
parapet
of
excavated
earth
with
occasional
bored
in
it
so
that
the
sentry
going
his
rounds
could
look
out
and
see
if
there
was
any
sign
of
movement
from
opposite
without
showing
his
head
above
the
entrenchment
but
even
this
was
a
matter
of
some
risk
since
the
enemy
had
located
these
and
from
time
to
time
fired
a
shot
from
a
fixed
rifle
that
came
straight
through
them
and
buried
its
bullet
in
the
hinder
wall
of
the
trench
other
were
therefore
being
made
but
these
were
not
yet
finished
and
for
the
present
till
they
were
dug
it
was
necessary
to
use
the
old
ones
the
trench
like
all
the
others
was
excavated
in
short
zigzag
lengths
so
that
no
point
either
to
right
or
left
commanded
more
than
a
score
of
yards
of
it
in
front
from
just
outside
the
parapet
to
a
depth
of
some
twenty
yards
stretched
the
of
wire
entanglements
and
a
little
farther
down
on
the
right
there
had
been
a
copse
of
saplings
an
attempt
had
been
made
by
the
enemy
during
the
morning
to
capture
and
entrench
this
thus
advancing
their
lines
but
the
movement
had
been
seen
and
the
artillery
fire
which
had
been
so
incessant
all
the
morning
denoted
the
searching
of
this
and
the
rendering
of
it
untenable
how
thorough
that
searching
had
been
was
clear
for
that
which
had
been
an
acre
of
wood
was
now
but
a
heap
of
timber
fit
only
for
faggots
scarcely
a
tree
was
left
standing
and
michael
looking
out
of
one
of
the
by
the
light
of
a
saw
that
the
wire
entanglements
were
thick
with
leaves
that
the
wind
and
the
firing
had
detached
from
the
broken
branches
in
turn
the
wire
entanglements
had
come
in
for
some
shelling
by
the
enemy
and
a
squad
of
men
were
out
now
under
cover
of
the
darkness
repairing
these
there
was
a
slight
dip
in
the
ground
here
and
by
crouching
and
lying
they
were
out
of
sight
of
the
trenches
opposite
but
there
were
some
snipers
in
that
which
had
been
a
wood
from
whom
there
came
occasional
shots
then
from
lower
down
to
the
right
there
came
a
fusillade
from
the
english
lines
suddenly
breaking
out
and
after
a
few
minutes
as
suddenly
stopping
again
but
the
sniping
from
the
wood
had
ceased
michael
did
not
come
on
duty
till
six
in
the
morning
and
for
the
present
he
had
nothing
to
do
except
eat
his
rations
and
sleep
as
well
as
he
could
in
his
he
had
plenty
of
room
to
stretch
his
legs
if
he
sat
half
upright
and
having
taken
his
major
s
advice
in
the
matter
of
bringing
his
fur
coat
with
him
he
found
himself
warm
enough
in
spite
of
the
rather
bitter
wind
that
striking
an
angle
in
the
trench
wall
eddied
sharply
into
his
retreat
to
sleep
but
not
less
justified
than
the
advice
to
bring
his
fur
coat
was
his
major
s
assurance
that
the
attack
of
the
horrors
which
had
seized
him
after
dinner
that
day
would
pass
off
when
the
waiting
was
over
throughout
the
evening
his
nerves
had
been
perfectly
steady
and
when
in
their
progress
up
the
communication
trench
they
had
passed
a
man
half
disembowelled
by
a
fragment
of
a
shell
and
screaming
or
when
as
he
trod
on
one
of
the
uneasy
places
an
arm
had
stirred
and
jerked
up
suddenly
through
the
handful
of
earth
that
covered
it
he
had
no
sense
of
horror
he
felt
rather
as
if
those
things
were
happening
not
to
him
but
to
someone
else
and
that
at
the
most
they
were
strange
and
odd
but
no
longer
horrible
but
now
when
reinforced
by
food
again
and
comfortable
beneath
his
fur
cloak
he
let
his
mind
do
what
it
would
not
checking
it
but
allowing
it
its
natural
internal
activity
he
found
that
a
mood
transcending
any
he
had
known
yet
was
his
so
far
from
these
experiences
being
terrifying
so
far
from
their
being
strange
and
unreal
they
suddenly
became
intensely
real
and
shone
with
a
splendour
that
he
had
never
suspected
originally
he
had
been
pitchforked
by
his
father
into
the
army
and
had
left
it
to
seek
music
sense
of
duty
had
made
it
easy
for
him
to
return
to
it
at
a
time
of
national
peril
but
during
all
the
bitter
anxiety
of
that
he
had
never
as
in
the
light
of
the
perception
that
came
to
him
now
as
the
wind
whistled
round
him
in
the
dim
lit
darkness
had
a
glimpse
of
the
glory
of
service
to
his
country
here
out
in
this
small
cavern
with
the
whole
grim
business
of
war
going
on
round
him
he
for
the
first
time
fully
realised
the
reality
of
it
all
he
had
been
in
the
trenches
before
but
until
now
that
had
seemed
some
vague
evil
dream
of
which
he
was
incredulous
now
in
the
darkness
the
darkness
cleared
and
the
knowledge
that
this
was
the
very
thing
itself
that
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
away
were
the
lines
of
the
enemy
whose
power
for
the
honour
of
england
and
for
the
freedom
of
europe
had
to
be
broken
utterly
filled
him
with
a
sense
of
firm
indescribable
joy
the
minor
problems
which
had
worried
him
the
fact
of
millions
of
treasure
that
might
have
fed
the
poor
and
needy
over
all
britain
for
a
score
of
years
being
outpoured
in
fire
and
steel
the
fact
of
thousands
of
useful
and
happy
lives
being
sacrificed
of
widows
and
orphans
and
childless
mothers
growing
ever
a
greater
company
all
these
things
terrible
to
look
at
if
you
looked
at
them
alone
sank
quietly
into
their
sad
appointed
places
when
you
looked
at
the
thing
entire
his
own
case
sank
there
too
music
and
life
and
love
for
which
he
would
so
rapturously
have
lived
were
covered
up
now
and
at
this
moment
he
would
as
rapturously
have
died
if
by
his
death
he
could
have
served
in
his
own
infinitesimal
degree
the
cause
he
fought
for
the
hours
went
on
whether
swiftly
or
slowly
he
did
not
consider
the
wind
fell
and
for
some
minutes
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
plumped
vertically
into
the
trench
once
during
it
a
sudden
illumination
blazed
in
the
sky
and
he
saw
the
pebbles
in
the
wall
opposite
shining
with
the
drops
there
were
a
dozen
and
he
saw
the
sentry
who
had
just
passed
brushing
the
edge
of
his
coat
against
michael
s
hand
pause
and
look
out
through
the
close
by
and
say
something
to
himself
occasionally
he
dozed
for
a
little
and
woke
again
from
dreaming
of
sylvia
into
complete
consciousness
of
where
he
was
and
of
that
superb
joy
that
pervaded
him
by
and
by
these
dozings
grew
longer
and
the
intervals
of
wakefulness
less
and
for
a
couple
of
hours
before
he
was
roused
he
slept
solidly
and
dreamlessly
his
spell
of
duty
began
before
dawn
and
he
got
up
to
go
his
rounds
rather
stiff
and
numb
and
his
sleep
seemed
to
have
wearied
rather
than
refreshed
him
in
that
hour
of
early
morning
when
vitality
burns
lowest
and
the
dying
part
their
hold
on
life
the
thrill
that
had
possessed
him
during
the
earlier
hours
of
the
night
had
died
down
he
knew
having
once
felt
it
that
it
was
there
and
believed
that
it
would
come
when
called
upon
but
it
had
drowsed
as
he
slept
and
was
overlaid
by
the
sense
of
the
grim
inexorable
side
of
the
whole
business
a
disconcerting
bullet
was
plugged
through
a
the
second
after
he
had
passed
it
it
sounded
not
angry
but
merely
and
michael
found
himself
thinking
that
shots
fired
in
anger
as
the
phrase
went
were
much
more
likely
to
go
wide
than
shots
fired
calmly
that
in
his
sleepy
brain
did
not
sound
nonsense
it
seemed
to
contain
some
great
truth
if
he
could
bother
to
think
it
out
but
for
that
all
was
quiet
again
and
he
had
returned
to
his
just
noticing
that
the
dawn
was
beginning
to
break
for
the
clouds
overhead
were
becoming
visible
in
outline
with
the
light
that
filtered
through
them
and
on
their
thinner
margin
turning
when
the
alarm
of
an
attack
came
down
the
line
instantly
the
huddled
sleeping
bodies
that
lay
at
the
side
of
the
trench
started
into
being
and
in
the
moment
s
pause
that
followed
michael
found
himself
fumbling
at
the
butt
of
his
revolver
which
he
had
drawn
out
of
its
case
for
that
one
moment
he
heard
his
heart
thumping
in
his
throat
and
felt
his
mouth
grow
dry
with
some
sudden
panic
fear
that
came
from
he
knew
not
where
and
invaded
him
a
qualm
of
sickness
took
him
something
gurgled
in
his
throat
and
he
spat
on
the
floor
of
the
trench
all
this
passed
in
one
second
for
at
once
he
was
master
of
himself
again
though
not
master
of
a
savage
joy
that
thrilled
him
the
joy
of
this
chance
of
killing
those
who
fought
against
the
peace
and
prosperity
of
the
world
there
was
an
attack
coming
out
of
the
dark
and
thank
god
he
was
among
those
who
had
to
meet
it
he
gave
the
order
that
had
been
passed
to
him
and
on
the
word
this
section
of
the
trench
was
lined
with
men
ready
to
pour
a
volley
over
the
low
parapet
he
was
there
too
wildly
excited
close
to
the
that
now
showed
as
a
luminous
disc
against
the
blackness
of
the
trench
he
looked
out
of
this
and
in
the
breaking
dawn
he
saw
nothing
but
the
dark
ground
of
the
dip
in
front
and
the
level
lines
of
the
german
trenches
opposite
then
suddenly
the
grey
emptiness
was
peopled
there
sprang
from
the
earth
the
advance
line
of
the
surprise
who
began
hewing
a
way
through
the
entanglements
while
behind
the
silhouette
of
the
trenches
was
broken
into
a
huddled
heaving
line
of
men
then
came
the
order
to
fire
and
he
saw
men
dropping
and
falling
out
of
sight
and
others
coming
on
and
yet
again
others
these
again
fell
but
others
and
now
he
could
see
the
gleam
of
bayonets
came
nearer
bursting
and
cutting
their
way
through
the
wires
then
from
opposite
to
right
and
left
sounded
the
crack
of
rifles
and
the
man
next
to
michael
gave
one
grunt
and
fell
back
into
the
trench
moving
no
more
just
immediately
opposite
were
the
few
dozen
men
whose
part
it
was
to
cut
through
the
entanglements
they
kept
falling
and
passing
out
of
sight
while
others
took
their
places
and
then
for
some
reason
michael
found
himself
singling
out
just
one
of
these
much
in
advance
of
the
others
who
was
now
close
to
the
parapet
he
was
coming
straight
on
him
and
with
a
leap
he
cleared
the
last
line
of
wire
and
towered
above
him
michael
shot
him
with
his
revolver
as
he
stood
but
three
yards
from
him
and
he
fell
right
across
the
parapet
with
head
and
shoulders
inside
the
trench
and
as
he
dropped
michael
shouted
got
him
and
then
he
looked
it
was
hermann
next
moment
he
had
scaled
the
side
of
the
trench
and
exerting
all
his
strength
was
dragging
him
over
into
safety
the
advance
of
this
section
who
were
to
rush
the
trench
had
been
stopped
and
again
from
right
and
left
the
poured
out
on
the
heads
that
appeared
above
the
parapet
that
did
not
seem
to
concern
him
all
he
had
to
do
that
moment
was
to
get
hermann
out
of
fire
and
just
as
he
dragged
his
legs
over
the
parapet
so
that
his
weight
fell
firm
and
solid
on
to
him
he
felt
what
seemed
a
sharp
tap
on
his
right
arm
and
could
not
understand
why
it
had
become
suddenly
powerless
it
dangled
loosely
from
somewhere
above
the
elbow
and
when
he
tried
to
move
his
hand
he
found
he
could
not
then
came
a
stab
of
hideous
pain
which
was
over
almost
as
soon
as
he
had
felt
it
and
he
heard
a
man
close
to
him
say
are
you
hit
sir
it
was
evident
that
this
surprise
attack
had
failed
for
five
minutes
afterwards
all
was
quiet
again
out
of
the
grey
of
dawn
it
had
come
and
before
dawn
was
rosy
it
was
over
and
michael
with
his
right
arm
numb
but
for
an
occasional
twinge
of
violent
agony
that
seemed
to
him
more
like
a
scream
or
a
colour
than
pain
was
leaning
over
hermann
who
lay
on
his
back
quite
still
while
on
his
tunic
a
splash
of
blood
slowly
grew
larger
dawn
was
already
rosy
when
he
moved
slightly
and
opened
his
eyes
lieber
gott
michael
he
whispered
his
breath
whistling
in
his
throat
good
morning
old
boy
chapter
xvii
three
weeks
later
michael
was
sitting
in
his
rooms
in
half
moon
street
where
he
had
arrived
last
night
expecting
sylvia
since
that
attack
at
dawn
in
the
trenches
he
had
been
in
hospital
in
france
while
his
arm
was
mending
the
bone
had
not
been
broken
but
the
muscles
had
been
so
badly
torn
that
it
was
doubtful
whether
he
would
ever
recover
more
than
a
very
feeble
power
in
it
again
in
any
case
it
would
take
many
months
before
he
recovered
even
the
most
elementary
use
of
it
those
weeks
had
been
a
continuous
nightmare
not
from
the
effect
of
the
injury
he
had
undergone
nor
from
any
nervous
breakdown
but
from
the
sense
of
that
which
inevitably
hung
over
him
for
he
knew
by
an
inward
compulsion
of
his
mind
that
admitted
of
no
argument
that
he
had
to
tell
sylvia
all
that
had
happened
in
those
ten
minutes
while
the
grey
morning
grew
rosy
this
sense
of
compulsion
was
deaf
to
all
reasoning
however
plausible
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
unless
he
told
sylvia
who
it
was
whom
he
had
shot
at
range
as
he
leaped
the
last
wire
entanglement
no
one
else
ever
could
hermann
was
buried
now
in
the
same
grave
as
others
who
had
fallen
that
morning
his
name
would
be
given
out
as
missing
from
the
bavarian
corps
to
which
he
belonged
and
in
time
after
the
war
was
over
she
would
grow
to
believe
that
she
would
never
see
him
again
but
the
sheer
impossibility
of
letting
this
happen
though
it
entailed
nothing
on
him
except
the
mere
abstention
from
speech
took
away
the
slightest
temptation
that
silence
offered
he
knew
that
again
and
again
sylvia
would
refer
to
hermann
wondering
where
he
was
praying
for
his
safety
hoping
perhaps
even
that
like
michael
he
would
be
wounded
and
thus
escape
from
the
inferno
at
the
front
and
it
was
so
absolutely
out
of
the
question
that
he
should
listen
to
this
try
to
offer
little
encouragements
wonder
with
her
whether
he
was
not
safe
that
even
in
his
most
depressed
and
shrinking
hours
he
never
for
a
moment
contemplated
silence
certainly
he
had
to
tell
her
that
hermann
was
dead
and
to
account
for
the
fact
that
he
knew
him
to
be
dead
and
in
the
long
watches
of
the
wakeful
night
when
his
mind
moved
in
the
twilight
of
drowsiness
and
fever
and
pain
it
was
here
that
a
certain
temptation
entered
for
it
was
easy
to
say
and
no
one
could
ever
contradict
him
that
some
man
near
him
that
one
perhaps
who
had
fallen
back
with
a
grunt
had
killed
hermann
on
the
edge
of
the
trench
humanly
speaking
there
was
no
chance
at
all
of
that
innocent
falsehood
being
disproved
in
the
scurry
and
wild
confusion
of
the
attack
none
but
he
would
remember
exactly
what
had
happened
and
as
he
thought
of
that
tossing
and
turning
it
seemed
to
one
part
of
his
mind
that
the
innocence
of
that
falsehood
would
even
be
laudable
be
heroic
it
would
save
sylvia
the
horrible
shock
of
knowing
that
her
lover
had
killed
her
brother
it
would
save
her
all
that
piercing
of
the
iron
into
her
soul
that
must
inevitably
be
suffered
by
her
if
she
knew
the
truth
and
who
could
tell
what
effect
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
would
have
on
her
michael
felt
that
it
was
at
the
least
possible
that
she
could
never
bear
to
see
him
again
still
less
sleep
in
the
arms
of
the
one
who
had
killed
her
brother
that
knowledge
even
if
she
could
put
it
out
of
mind
in
pity
and
sorrow
for
michael
would
surely
return
and
return
again
and
tear
her
from
him
sobbing
and
trembling
there
was
all
to
risk
in
telling
her
the
truth
sorrow
and
bitterness
for
her
and
for
him
separation
and
a
lifelong
regret
were
piled
up
in
the
balance
against
the
unknown
weight
of
her
love
indeed
there
was
love
on
both
sides
of
that
balance
who
could
tell
how
the
gold
weighed
against
the
gold
yet
after
those
drowsy
nights
when
the
sober
light
of
dawn
crept
in
at
the
windows
then
morning
after
morning
michael
knew
that
the
inward
compulsion
was
in
no
way
weakened
by
all
the
reasons
that
he
had
urged
it
remained
ruthless
and
tender
a
still
small
voice
that
was
heard
after
the
whirlwind
and
the
fire
for
the
very
reason
why
he
longed
to
spare
sylvia
this
knowledge
namely
that
they
loved
each
other
was
precisely
the
reason
why
he
could
not
spare
her
yet
it
seemed
so
wanton
so
useless
so
unreasonable
to
tell
her
so
laden
with
a
risk
both
for
him
and
her
that
no
standard
could
measure
but
he
no
more
contemplated
except
in
vain
imagination
making
up
some
ingenious
story
of
this
kind
which
would
account
for
his
knowledge
of
hermann
s
death
than
he
contemplated
keeping
silence
altogether
it
was
not
possible
for
him
not
to
tell
her
everything
though
when
he
pictured
himself
doing
so
he
found
himself
faced
by
what
seemed
an
inevitable
impossibility
though
he
did
not
see
how
his
lips
could
frame
the
words
he
knew
they
had
to
yet
he
could
not
but
remember
how
mere
reports
in
the
paper
stories
of
german
cruelty
and
what
not
had
overclouded
the
serenity
of
their
love
what
would
happen
when
this
news
no
report
or
hearsay
came
to
her
he
had
not
heard
her
foot
on
the
stairs
nor
did
she
wait
for
his
servant
to
announce
her
but
a
little
before
her
appointed
time
she
burst
in
upon
him
midway
between
smiles
and
tears
all
tenderness
michael
my
dear
my
dear
she
cried
what
a
morning
for
me
for
the
first
time
when
i
woke
i
forgot
about
the
war
and
your
poor
arm
how
goes
it
oh
i
will
take
care
but
i
must
and
will
have
you
in
my
he
had
risen
to
greet
her
and
softly
and
gently
she
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
drawing
his
head
to
her
oh
my
michael
she
whispered
you
ve
come
back
to
me
lieber
gott
how
i
have
longed
for
you
lieber
gott
when
last
had
he
heard
those
words
he
had
to
tell
her
he
would
tell
her
in
a
minute
or
two
perhaps
she
would
never
hold
him
like
that
again
he
could
not
part
with
her
at
the
very
moment
he
had
got
her
you
look
ever
so
well
michael
she
said
in
spite
of
your
wound
you
re
so
brown
and
lean
and
strong
and
oh
how
i
have
wanted
you
i
never
knew
how
much
till
you
went
looking
at
her
feeling
her
arms
round
him
michael
felt
that
what
he
had
to
say
was
beyond
the
power
of
his
lips
to
utter
and
yet
here
in
her
presence
the
absolute
necessity
of
telling
her
climbed
like
some
peak
into
the
ample
sunrise
far
above
the
darkness
and
the
mists
that
hung
low
about
it
and
what
lots
you
must
have
to
tell
me
she
said
i
want
to
hear
all
suddenly
michael
put
up
his
left
hand
and
took
away
from
his
neck
the
arm
that
encircled
it
but
he
did
not
let
go
of
it
he
held
it
in
his
hand
i
have
to
tell
you
one
thing
at
once
he
said
she
looked
at
him
and
the
smile
that
burned
in
her
eyes
was
extinguished
from
his
gesture
from
his
tone
she
knew
that
he
spoke
of
something
as
serious
as
their
love
what
is
it
she
said
tell
me
he
did
not
falter
but
looked
her
full
in
the
face
there
was
no
breaking
it
to
her
or
letting
her
go
through
the
gathering
suspense
of
guessing
it
concerns
hermann
he
said
it
concerns
hermann
and
me
the
last
morning
that
i
was
in
the
trenches
there
was
an
attack
at
dawn
from
the
german
lines
they
tried
to
rush
our
trench
in
the
dark
hermann
led
them
he
got
right
up
to
the
trench
and
i
shot
him
i
did
not
know
thank
god
suddenly
michael
could
not
bear
to
look
at
her
any
more
he
put
his
arm
on
the
table
by
him
and
leaning
his
head
on
it
covering
his
eyes
he
went
on
but
his
voice
up
till
now
quite
steady
faltered
and
failed
as
the
sobs
gathered
in
his
throat
he
fell
across
the
parapet
close
to
me
he
said
i
lifted
him
somehow
into
our
trench
i
was
wounded
then
he
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
trench
sylvia
and
i
would
to
god
it
had
been
i
who
lay
there
because
i
loved
him
just
at
the
end
he
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
me
and
knew
me
and
he
said
oh
sylvia
sylvia
he
said
lieber
gott
michael
good
morning
old
and
then
he
died
i
have
told
and
at
that
michael
broke
down
utterly
and
completely
for
the
first
time
since
the
morning
of
which
he
spoke
and
sobbed
his
heart
out
while
unseen
to
him
sylvia
sat
with
hands
clasped
together
and
stretched
towards
him
just
for
a
little
she
let
him
weep
his
fill
but
her
yearning
for
him
would
not
be
withstood
she
knew
why
he
had
told
her
her
whole
heart
spoke
of
the
hugeness
of
it
then
once
more
she
laid
her
arm
on
his
neck
michael
my
heart
she
said
