he
walked
along
holywell
that
afternoon
of
early
june
with
his
short
gown
drooping
down
his
arms
and
no
cap
on
his
thick
dark
hair
a
youth
of
middle
height
and
built
as
if
he
had
come
of
two
very
different
strains
one
sturdy
the
other
wiry
and
light
his
face
too
was
a
curious
blend
for
though
it
was
strongly
formed
its
expression
was
rather
soft
and
moody
his
grey
with
a
good
deal
of
light
in
them
and
very
black
a
way
of
looking
beyond
what
they
saw
so
that
he
did
not
seem
always
to
be
quite
present
but
his
smile
was
exceedingly
swift
uncovering
teeth
as
white
as
a
negro
and
giving
his
face
a
peculiar
eagerness
people
stared
at
him
a
little
as
he
in
eighteen
hundred
and
eighty
he
was
before
his
time
in
not
wearing
a
cap
women
especially
were
interested
they
perceived
that
he
took
no
notice
of
them
seeming
rather
to
be
looking
into
distance
and
making
combinations
in
his
soul
did
he
know
of
what
he
was
he
ever
know
quite
definitely
at
that
time
of
his
life
when
things
especially
those
beyond
the
immediate
horizon
were
so
curious
and
interesting
things
he
was
going
to
see
and
do
when
he
had
got
through
oxford
where
everybody
was
decent
to
him
and
right
of
course
but
not
so
very
interesting
he
was
on
his
way
to
his
tutor
to
read
an
essay
on
oliver
cromwell
and
under
the
old
wall
which
had
once
hedged
in
the
town
he
took
out
of
his
pocket
a
beast
it
was
a
small
tortoise
and
with
an
extreme
absorption
he
watched
it
move
its
little
inquiring
head
feeling
it
all
the
time
with
his
short
broad
fingers
as
though
to
discover
exactly
how
it
was
made
it
was
mighty
hard
in
the
back
no
wonder
poor
old
aeschylus
felt
a
bit
sick
when
it
fell
on
his
head
the
ancients
used
it
to
stand
the
world
pagoda
world
perhaps
of
men
and
beasts
and
trees
like
that
carving
on
his
guardian
chinese
cabinet
the
chinese
made
jolly
beasts
and
trees
as
if
they
believed
in
everything
having
a
soul
and
not
only
being
just
fit
for
people
to
eat
or
drive
or
make
houses
of
if
only
the
art
school
would
let
him
model
things
his
own
instead
of
copying
and
was
just
as
if
they
imagined
it
would
be
dangerous
to
let
you
think
out
anything
for
yourself
he
held
the
tortoise
to
his
waistcoat
and
let
it
crawl
till
noticing
that
it
was
gnawing
the
corner
of
his
essay
he
put
it
back
into
his
pocket
what
would
his
tutor
do
if
he
were
to
know
it
was
there
his
head
a
little
to
one
side
and
say
ah
there
are
things
lennan
not
dreamed
of
in
my
philosophy
yes
there
were
a
good
many
not
dreamed
of
by
stormer
who
seemed
so
awfully
afraid
of
anything
that
was
usual
who
seemed
always
laughing
at
you
for
fear
that
you
should
laugh
at
him
there
were
lots
of
people
in
oxford
like
that
it
was
stupid
you
could
do
anything
decent
if
you
were
afraid
of
being
laughed
at
stormer
was
like
that
she
did
things
came
into
her
head
but
then
of
course
she
was
austrian
not
english
and
ever
so
much
younger
than
old
stormer
and
having
reached
the
door
of
his
tutor
house
he
rang
the
bell
ii
when
anna
stormer
came
into
the
study
she
found
her
husband
standing
at
the
window
with
his
head
a
little
on
one
tall
figure
in
clothes
of
a
pleasant
tweed
and
wearing
a
low
collar
not
common
in
those
days
and
a
blue
silk
tie
which
she
had
knitted
strung
through
a
ring
he
was
humming
and
gently
tapping
the
with
his
though
celebrated
for
the
amount
of
work
he
got
through
she
never
caught
him
doing
any
in
this
house
of
theirs
chosen
because
it
was
more
than
half
a
mile
away
from
the
college
which
held
the
young
clowns
as
he
called
them
of
whom
he
was
tutor
he
did
not
was
not
of
course
his
habit
to
notice
what
was
not
absolutely
she
felt
that
he
was
aware
of
her
she
came
to
the
window
seat
and
sat
down
he
looked
round
at
that
and
said
ah
it
was
a
murmur
almost
of
admiration
not
usual
from
him
since
with
the
exception
of
certain
portions
of
the
classics
it
was
hardly
his
custom
to
admire
but
she
knew
that
she
was
looking
her
best
sitting
there
her
really
beautiful
figure
poised
the
sun
shining
on
her
brown
hair
and
brightening
her
eyes
under
their
black
lashes
it
was
sometimes
a
great
comfort
to
her
that
she
remained
so
it
would
have
been
an
added
vexation
indeed
to
have
felt
that
she
ruffled
her
husband
fastidiousness
even
so
her
cheekbones
were
too
high
for
his
taste
symbols
of
that
something
in
her
character
which
did
not
go
with
dash
of
desperation
of
vividness
that
lack
of
a
certain
english
smoothness
which
always
annoyed
him
harold
would
never
quite
flatten
her
i
want
to
go
to
the
mountains
this
the
mountains
she
had
not
seen
them
since
that
season
at
san
martino
di
castrozza
twelve
years
ago
which
had
ended
in
her
marrying
him
nostalgia
i
do
know
what
that
am
homesick
can
we
go
if
you
not
but
no
leading
up
the
cimone
della
pala
for
me
she
knew
what
he
meant
by
that
no
romance
how
splendidly
he
had
led
that
day
she
had
almost
worshipped
him
what
blindness
what
distortion
was
it
really
the
same
man
standing
there
with
those
bright
doubting
eyes
with
grey
already
in
his
hair
yes
romance
was
over
and
she
sat
silent
looking
out
into
the
little
old
street
into
which
she
looked
day
and
night
a
figure
passed
out
there
came
to
the
door
and
rang
she
said
softly
here
is
mark
lennan
she
felt
her
husband
eyes
rest
on
her
just
for
a
moment
knew
that
he
had
turned
heard
him
murmur
ah
the
angel
clown
and
quite
still
she
waited
for
the
door
to
open
there
was
the
boy
with
his
blessed
dark
head
and
his
shy
gentle
gravity
and
his
essay
in
his
hand
well
lennan
and
how
old
noll
hypocrite
of
genius
eh
draw
up
let
get
him
over
motionless
from
her
seat
at
the
window
she
watched
those
two
figures
at
the
boy
reading
in
his
queer
velvety
bass
voice
her
husband
leaning
back
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
pressed
together
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
and
that
faint
satiric
smile
which
never
reached
his
eyes
yes
he
was
dozing
falling
asleep
and
the
boy
not
seeing
was
going
on
then
he
came
to
the
end
and
glanced
up
what
eyes
he
had
other
boys
would
have
laughed
but
he
looked
almost
sorry
she
heard
him
murmur
i
awfully
sorry
ah
lennan
you
caught
me
fact
is
term
fagged
me
out
we
going
to
the
mountains
ever
been
to
the
mountains
you
should
come
with
us
eh
what
do
you
say
anna
do
you
think
this
young
man
ought
to
come
with
us
she
got
up
and
stood
staring
at
them
both
had
she
heard
aright
then
she
gravely
yes
i
think
he
good
we
get
him
to
lead
up
the
cimone
della
pala
iii
when
the
boy
had
said
and
she
had
watched
him
out
into
the
street
anna
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
streak
of
sunlight
that
came
in
through
the
open
door
her
hands
pressed
to
cheeks
which
were
flaming
then
she
shut
the
door
and
leaned
her
forehead
against
the
seeing
nothing
her
heart
beat
very
fast
she
was
going
over
and
over
again
the
scene
just
passed
through
this
meant
so
much
more
than
it
had
seemed
to
mean
though
she
always
had
heimweh
and
especially
at
the
end
of
the
summer
term
this
year
it
had
been
a
different
feeling
altogether
that
made
her
say
to
her
husband
i
want
to
go
to
the
mountains
for
twelve
years
she
had
longed
for
the
mountains
every
summer
but
had
not
pleaded
for
them
this
year
she
had
pleaded
but
she
did
not
long
for
them
it
was
because
she
had
suddenly
realized
the
strange
fact
that
she
did
not
want
to
leave
england
and
the
reason
for
it
that
she
had
come
and
begged
to
go
yet
why
when
it
was
just
to
get
away
from
thought
of
this
boy
had
she
said
yes
i
think
he
ought
to
come
ah
but
life
for
her
was
always
a
strange
pull
between
the
conscientious
and
the
desperate
a
queer
vivid
aching
business
how
long
was
it
now
since
that
day
when
he
first
came
to
lunch
silent
and
shy
and
suddenly
smiling
as
if
he
were
all
lighted
up
day
when
she
had
said
to
her
husband
afterwards
ah
he
an
angel
not
yet
a
beginning
of
last
october
term
in
fact
he
was
different
from
all
the
other
boys
not
that
he
was
a
prodigy
with
untidy
hair
clothes
and
a
clever
tongue
but
because
of
because
he
because
she
longed
to
take
his
head
between
her
hands
and
kiss
it
she
remembered
so
well
the
day
that
longing
first
came
to
her
she
was
giving
him
tea
it
was
quite
early
in
the
easter
term
he
was
stroking
her
cat
who
always
went
to
him
and
telling
her
that
he
meant
to
be
a
sculptor
but
that
his
guardian
objected
so
that
of
course
he
could
not
start
till
he
was
of
age
the
lamp
on
the
table
had
a
shade
he
had
been
very
cold
his
face
was
glowing
generally
it
was
rather
pale
and
suddenly
he
smiled
and
said
it
rotten
waiting
for
things
it
it
was
then
she
had
almost
stretched
out
her
hands
to
draw
his
forehead
to
her
lips
she
had
thought
then
that
she
wanted
to
kiss
him
because
it
would
have
been
so
nice
to
be
his
might
just
have
been
his
mother
if
she
had
married
at
sixteen
but
she
had
long
known
now
that
she
wanted
to
kiss
not
his
forehead
but
his
lips
he
was
there
in
her
fire
in
a
cold
and
unaired
house
it
had
even
become
hard
to
understand
that
she
could
have
gone
on
all
these
years
without
him
she
had
missed
him
so
those
six
weeks
of
the
easter
vacation
she
had
revelled
so
in
his
three
queer
little
letters
kissed
them
and
worn
them
in
her
dress
and
in
return
had
written
him
long
perfectly
correct
epistles
in
her
still
rather
quaint
english
she
had
never
let
him
guess
her
feelings
the
idea
that
he
might
shocked
her
inexpressibly
when
the
summer
term
began
life
seemed
to
be
all
made
up
of
thoughts
of
him
if
ten
years
ago
her
baby
had
lived
if
its
cruel
her
not
killed
for
good
her
wish
to
have
another
if
for
years
now
she
had
not
been
living
with
the
knowledge
that
she
had
no
warmth
to
expect
and
that
love
was
all
over
for
her
if
life
in
the
most
beautiful
of
all
old
cities
had
been
able
to
grip
would
have
been
forces
to
check
this
feeling
but
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
to
divert
the
current
and
she
was
so
brimful
of
life
so
conscious
of
vitality
running
to
sheer
waste
sometimes
it
had
been
terrific
that
feeling
within
her
of
wanting
to
find
outlet
for
her
energy
so
many
hundreds
of
lonely
walks
she
had
taken
during
all
these
years
trying
to
lose
herself
in
alone
running
in
the
woods
over
the
fields
where
people
did
not
come
trying
to
get
rid
of
that
sense
of
waste
trying
once
more
to
feel
as
she
had
felt
when
a
girl
with
the
whole
world
before
her
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
her
figure
was
superb
her
hair
so
bright
a
brown
her
eyes
so
full
of
light
she
had
tried
many
distractions
work
in
the
back
streets
music
acting
hunting
given
them
up
one
after
the
other
taken
to
them
passionately
again
they
had
served
in
the
past
but
this
year
they
had
not
served
one
sunday
coming
from
confession
unconfessed
she
had
faced
herself
it
was
wicked
she
would
have
to
kill
this
fly
from
this
boy
who
moved
her
so
if
she
did
not
act
quickly
she
would
be
swept
away
and
then
the
thought
had
come
why
not
life
was
to
be
torpidly
dozed
through
in
this
queer
cultured
place
where
age
was
in
the
blood
life
was
for
be
enjoyed
and
she
would
be
next
month
it
seemed
to
her
already
an
enormous
age
soon
she
would
be
old
actually
never
have
known
passion
the
worship
which
had
made
a
hero
of
the
englishman
twelve
years
older
than
herself
who
could
lead
up
the
cimone
della
pala
had
not
been
passion
it
might
perhaps
have
become
passion
if
he
had
so
willed
but
he
was
all
form
ice
books
had
he
a
heart
at
all
had
he
blood
in
his
veins
was
there
any
joy
of
life
in
this
too
beautiful
city
and
these
people
who
lived
in
place
where
even
enthusiasms
seemed
to
be
formal
and
have
no
wings
where
everything
was
settled
and
sophisticated
as
the
very
chapels
and
cloisters
and
yet
to
have
this
feeling
for
a
one
almost
young
enough
to
be
her
son
it
was
that
thought
haunted
her
made
her
flush
in
the
dark
lying
awake
at
night
and
desperately
she
would
she
was
to
be
made
pure
to
be
given
the
holy
feelings
of
a
mother
to
be
filled
simply
with
the
sweet
sense
that
she
could
do
everything
suffer
anything
for
him
for
his
good
after
these
long
prayers
she
would
feel
calmed
drowsy
as
though
she
had
taken
a
drug
for
hours
perhaps
she
would
stay
like
that
and
then
it
would
all
come
over
her
again
she
never
thought
of
his
loving
her
that
would
why
should
he
love
her
she
was
very
humble
about
it
ever
since
that
sunday
when
she
avoided
the
confessional
she
had
brooded
over
how
to
make
an
to
get
away
from
a
longing
that
was
too
strong
for
her
and
she
had
hit
on
this
beg
for
the
mountains
to
go
back
to
where
her
husband
had
come
into
her
life
and
try
if
this
feeling
would
not
die
if
it
did
not
she
would
ask
to
be
left
out
there
with
her
own
people
away
from
this
danger
and
now
the
blind
superior
his
satiric
smile
his
everlasting
patronage
had
driven
her
to
overturn
her
own
plan
well
let
him
take
the
consequences
she
had
done
her
best
she
would
have
this
one
fling
of
joy
even
if
it
meant
that
she
must
stay
out
there
and
never
see
the
boy
again
standing
in
her
dusky
hall
where
a
faint
scent
of
woodrot
crept
out
into
the
air
whenever
windows
and
doors
were
closed
she
was
all
tremulous
with
secret
happiness
to
be
with
him
among
her
mountains
to
show
him
all
those
wonderful
glittering
or
tawny
crags
to
go
with
him
to
the
top
of
them
and
see
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
spread
out
below
to
wander
with
him
in
the
pine
woods
on
the
alps
in
all
the
scent
of
the
trees
and
the
flowers
where
the
sun
was
hot
the
first
of
july
and
it
was
only
the
tenth
of
june
would
she
ever
live
so
long
they
would
not
go
to
san
martino
this
time
rather
to
new
place
that
had
no
memories
she
moved
from
the
window
and
busied
herself
with
a
bowl
of
flowers
she
had
heard
that
humming
sound
which
often
heralded
her
approach
as
though
warning
the
world
to
recover
its
good
form
before
he
reached
it
in
her
happiness
she
felt
kind
and
friendly
to
him
if
he
had
not
meant
to
give
her
joy
he
had
nevertheless
given
it
he
came
downstairs
two
at
a
time
with
that
air
of
not
being
a
pedagogue
which
she
knew
so
well
and
taking
his
hat
off
the
stand
half
turned
round
to
her
pleasant
youth
young
lennan
hope
he
wo
bore
us
out
there
his
voice
seemed
to
have
an
accent
of
compunction
to
ask
pardon
for
having
issued
that
impulsive
invitation
and
there
came
to
her
an
overwhelming
wish
to
laugh
to
hide
it
to
find
excuse
for
it
she
ran
up
to
him
and
pulling
his
coat
lapels
till
his
face
was
within
reach
she
kissed
the
tip
of
his
nose
and
then
she
laughed
and
he
stood
looking
at
her
with
his
head
just
a
little
on
one
side
and
his
eyebrows
just
a
little
raised
iv
when
young
mark
heard
a
soft
tapping
at
his
door
though
out
of
bed
he
was
getting
on
but
was
so
jolly
to
watch
the
mountains
lying
out
in
this
early
light
like
huge
beasts
that
one
they
were
going
up
with
his
head
just
raised
above
his
paws
looked
very
far
away
out
there
opening
the
door
an
inch
he
whispered
is
it
late
five
are
you
ready
it
was
awfully
rude
of
him
to
keep
her
waiting
and
he
was
soon
down
in
the
empty
where
a
sleepy
maid
was
already
bringing
in
their
coffee
anna
was
there
alone
she
had
on
a
shirt
open
at
the
neck
a
short
green
skirt
and
a
velvety
hat
small
with
one
feather
why
could
not
people
always
wear
such
nice
things
and
be
as
and
he
said
you
do
look
jolly
stormer
she
did
not
answer
for
so
long
that
he
wondered
if
it
had
been
rude
to
say
that
but
she
did
look
so
strong
and
swift
and
down
the
hill
through
a
wood
of
to
the
river
and
across
the
bridge
to
mount
at
once
by
a
path
through
how
could
old
stormer
stay
in
bed
on
such
a
morning
the
peasant
girls
in
their
blue
linen
skirts
were
already
gathering
into
bundles
what
the
men
had
scythed
one
raking
at
the
edge
of
a
field
paused
and
shyly
nodded
to
them
she
had
the
face
of
a
madonna
very
calm
and
grave
and
sweet
with
delicate
arched
face
it
was
pure
pleasure
to
see
the
boy
looked
back
at
her
everything
to
him
who
had
never
been
out
of
england
before
seemed
strange
and
glamorous
the
chalets
with
their
long
wide
wooden
balconies
and
eaves
jutting
far
beyond
the
walls
these
bright
dresses
of
the
peasant
women
the
friendly
little
cows
with
blunt
muzzles
even
the
feel
in
the
air
was
new
that
delicious
crisp
burning
warmth
that
lay
so
lightly
as
it
were
on
the
surface
of
frozen
stillness
and
the
special
sweetness
of
all
places
at
the
foot
of
of
burning
and
all
the
meadow
flowers
and
grasses
but
newest
of
all
was
the
feeling
within
sort
of
pride
a
sense
of
importance
a
queer
exhilaration
at
being
alone
with
her
chosen
companion
of
one
so
beautiful
they
passed
all
the
other
pilgrims
bound
the
same
square
germans
with
their
coats
slung
through
straps
who
trailed
behind
them
heavy
alpenstocks
carried
greenish
bags
and
marched
stolidly
at
a
pace
that
never
varied
growling
as
anna
and
the
boy
went
by
aber
eilen
ist
nichts
but
those
two
could
not
go
fast
enough
to
keep
pace
with
their
spirits
this
was
no
real
a
training
walk
to
the
top
of
the
nuvolau
and
they
were
up
before
noon
and
soon
again
descending
very
hungry
when
they
entered
the
little
of
the
cinque
torre
hutte
they
found
it
occupied
by
a
party
of
english
people
eating
omelettes
who
looked
at
anna
with
faint
signs
of
recognition
but
did
not
cease
talking
in
voices
that
all
had
a
certain
precision
a
slight
but
brisk
pinching
of
sounds
as
if
determined
not
to
tolerate
a
drawl
and
yet
to
have
one
most
of
them
had
slung
round
them
and
cameras
were
dotted
here
and
there
about
the
room
their
faces
were
not
really
much
alike
but
they
all
had
a
peculiar
drooping
smile
and
a
particular
lift
of
the
eyebrows
that
made
them
seem
reproductions
of
a
single
type
their
teeth
too
for
the
most
part
were
a
little
prominent
as
though
the
drooping
of
their
mouths
had
forced
them
forward
they
were
eating
as
people
eat
who
distrust
the
lower
senses
preferring
not
to
be
compelled
to
taste
or
smell
from
our
hotel
whispered
anna
and
ordering
red
wine
and
schnitzels
she
and
the
boy
sat
down
the
lady
who
seemed
in
command
of
the
english
party
inquired
now
how
stormer
was
not
laid
up
she
hoped
no
only
lazy
indeed
he
was
a
great
climber
she
believed
it
seemed
to
the
boy
that
this
lady
somehow
did
not
quite
approve
of
them
the
talk
was
all
maintained
between
her
a
gentleman
with
a
crumpled
collar
and
puggaree
and
a
short
man
in
a
dark
norfolk
jacket
if
any
of
the
younger
members
of
the
party
spoke
the
remark
was
received
with
an
arch
lifting
of
the
brows
and
drooping
of
the
lids
as
who
should
say
ah
very
promising
nothing
in
my
life
has
given
me
greater
pain
than
to
observe
the
aptitude
of
human
nature
for
becoming
it
was
the
lady
in
command
who
spoke
and
all
the
young
people
swayed
their
faces
up
and
down
as
if
assenting
how
like
they
were
the
boy
thought
to
with
their
small
heads
and
sloping
shoulders
and
speckly
grey
coats
ah
my
dear
lady
was
the
gentleman
with
the
crumpled
you
novelists
are
always
girding
at
the
precious
quality
of
conformity
the
sadness
of
our
times
lies
in
this
questioning
spirit
never
was
there
more
revolt
especially
among
the
young
to
find
the
individual
judging
for
himself
is
a
grave
symptom
of
national
degeneration
but
this
is
not
a
surely
the
subject
is
of
the
most
poignant
interest
to
all
young
again
all
the
young
ones
raised
their
faces
and
moved
them
slightly
from
side
to
side
my
dear
lady
we
are
too
prone
to
let
the
interest
that
things
arouse
blind
our
judgment
in
regard
to
the
advisability
of
discussing
them
we
let
these
speculations
creep
and
creep
until
they
twine
themselves
round
our
faith
and
paralyze
one
of
the
young
men
interjected
suddenly
madre
was
silent
i
shall
not
i
think
was
the
lady
be
accused
of
licence
when
i
say
that
i
have
always
felt
that
speculation
is
only
dangerous
when
indulged
in
by
the
crude
intelligence
if
culture
has
nothing
to
give
us
then
let
us
have
no
culture
but
if
culture
be
as
i
think
it
indispensable
then
we
must
accept
the
dangers
that
culture
again
the
young
people
moved
their
faces
and
again
the
younger
of
the
two
young
men
said
dangers
have
cultured
people
dangers
who
had
spoken
thus
every
eyebrow
was
going
up
every
mouth
was
drooping
and
there
was
silence
the
boy
stared
at
his
companion
in
what
a
strange
voice
she
had
made
that
little
interjection
there
seemed
a
sort
of
flame
too
lighted
in
her
eyes
then
the
little
man
said
and
his
rather
whispering
voice
sounded
hard
and
acid
we
are
all
human
my
dear
the
boy
felt
his
heart
go
thump
at
anna
laugh
it
was
just
as
if
she
had
said
ah
but
not
and
he
got
up
to
follow
her
towards
the
door
the
english
party
had
begun
already
the
weather
the
two
walked
some
way
from
the
in
silence
before
anna
said
you
did
like
me
when
i
laughed
you
hurt
their
feelings
i
i
wanted
english
grundys
ah
do
be
cross
with
me
they
were
english
grundys
were
one
she
looked
into
his
face
so
hard
that
he
felt
the
blood
rush
to
his
cheeks
and
a
dizzy
sensation
of
being
drawn
forward
they
have
no
blood
those
people
their
voices
their
supercilious
eyes
that
look
you
up
and
down
oh
i
had
so
much
of
them
that
woman
with
her
liberalism
just
as
bad
as
any
i
hate
them
all
he
would
have
liked
to
hate
them
too
since
she
did
but
they
had
only
seemed
to
him
amusing
they
are
human
they
do
feel
some
day
you
know
them
they
wo
amuse
you
then
she
went
on
in
a
quiet
almost
dreamy
voice
why
do
they
come
here
it
still
young
and
warm
and
good
out
here
why
do
they
keep
to
their
culture
where
no
one
knows
what
it
is
to
ache
and
feel
hunger
and
hearts
do
beat
feel
disturbed
beyond
measure
the
boy
could
not
tell
whether
it
was
in
her
heart
or
in
his
hand
that
the
blood
was
pulsing
so
was
he
glad
or
sorry
when
she
let
his
hand
go
ah
well
they
ca
spoil
this
day
let
at
the
edge
of
the
where
they
sat
were
growing
numbers
of
little
mountain
pinks
with
fringed
edges
and
the
sweetest
scent
imaginable
and
she
got
up
presently
to
gather
them
but
he
stayed
where
he
was
and
odd
sensations
stirred
in
him
the
blue
of
the
sky
the
feathery
green
of
the
the
mountains
were
no
longer
to
him
what
they
had
been
early
that
morning
she
came
back
with
her
hands
full
of
the
little
pinks
spread
her
fingers
and
let
them
drop
they
showered
all
over
his
face
and
neck
never
was
so
wonderful
a
scent
never
such
a
strange
feeling
as
they
gave
him
they
clung
to
his
hair
his
forehead
his
eyes
one
even
got
caught
on
the
curve
of
his
lips
and
he
stared
up
at
her
through
their
fringed
petals
there
must
have
been
something
wild
in
his
eyes
then
something
of
the
feeling
that
was
stinging
his
heart
for
her
smile
died
she
walked
away
and
stood
with
her
face
turned
from
him
confused
and
unhappy
he
gathered
the
strewn
flowers
and
not
till
he
had
collected
every
one
did
he
get
up
and
shyly
take
them
to
her
where
she
still
stood
gazing
into
the
depths
of
the
v
what
did
he
know
of
women
that
should
make
him
understand
at
his
public
school
he
had
seen
none
to
speak
to
at
oxford
only
this
one
at
home
in
the
holidays
not
any
save
his
sister
cicely
the
two
hobbies
of
their
guardian
fishing
and
the
antiquities
of
his
native
county
rendered
him
averse
to
society
so
that
his
little
devonshire
with
its
black
oak
panels
and
its
wild
park
along
the
was
from
year
end
to
year
end
innocent
of
all
petticoats
save
those
of
cicely
and
old
miss
tring
the
governess
then
too
the
boy
was
shy
no
there
was
nothing
in
his
past
of
not
yet
quite
nineteen
years
to
go
by
he
was
not
of
those
youths
who
are
always
thinking
of
conquests
the
very
idea
of
conquest
seemed
to
him
vulgar
mean
horrid
there
must
be
many
signs
indeed
before
it
would
come
into
his
head
that
a
woman
was
in
love
with
him
especially
the
one
to
whom
he
looked
up
and
thought
so
beautiful
for
before
all
beauty
he
was
humble
inclined
to
think
himself
a
clod
it
was
the
part
of
life
which
was
always
unconsciously
sacred
and
to
be
approached
trembling
the
more
he
admired
the
more
tremulous
and
diffident
he
became
and
so
after
his
one
wild
moment
when
she
plucked
those
blossoms
and
dropped
them
over
him
he
felt
abashed
and
walking
home
beside
her
he
was
quieter
than
ever
awkward
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
if
there
were
confusion
in
his
heart
which
had
been
innocent
of
trouble
what
must
there
have
been
in
hers
that
for
so
long
had
secretly
desired
the
dawning
of
that
confusion
and
she
too
was
very
silent
passing
a
church
with
open
door
in
the
outskirts
of
the
village
she
said
do
wait
for
want
to
go
in
here
a
in
the
empty
twilight
within
one
figure
a
countrywoman
in
her
black
shawl
was
still
he
would
have
liked
to
stay
that
kneeling
figure
the
smile
of
the
sunlight
filtering
through
into
the
half
darkness
he
lingered
long
enough
to
see
anna
too
go
down
on
her
knees
in
the
stillness
was
she
praying
again
he
had
the
turbulent
feeling
with
which
he
had
watched
her
pluck
those
flowers
she
looked
so
splendid
kneeling
there
it
was
caddish
to
feel
like
that
when
she
was
praying
and
he
turned
quickly
away
into
the
road
but
that
sharp
sweet
stinging
sensation
did
not
leave
him
he
shut
his
eyes
to
get
rid
of
her
instantly
she
became
ten
times
more
visible
his
feeling
ten
times
stronger
he
mounted
to
the
hotel
there
on
the
terrace
was
his
tutor
and
oddly
enough
the
sight
of
him
at
that
moment
was
no
more
embarrassing
than
if
it
had
been
the
hotel
concierge
stormer
did
not
somehow
seem
to
count
did
not
seem
to
want
you
to
count
him
besides
he
was
so
fifty
the
man
who
was
so
old
was
posed
in
a
characteristic
in
the
pockets
of
his
norfolk
jacket
one
shoulder
slightly
raised
head
just
a
little
on
one
side
as
if
preparing
to
quiz
something
he
spoke
as
lennan
came
up
not
with
his
eyes
well
young
man
and
what
have
you
done
with
my
wife
left
her
in
a
church
ah
she
will
do
that
has
she
run
you
off
your
legs
no
then
walk
and
talk
a
to
be
thus
pacing
up
and
down
and
talking
with
her
husband
seemed
quite
natural
did
not
even
interfere
with
those
new
sensations
did
not
in
the
least
increase
his
shame
for
having
them
he
only
wondered
a
little
how
she
could
have
married
so
little
quite
far
and
academic
was
his
his
wonder
in
old
days
how
his
sister
could
care
to
play
with
dolls
if
he
had
any
other
feeling
it
was
just
a
longing
to
get
away
and
go
down
the
hill
again
to
the
church
it
seemed
cold
and
lonely
after
all
that
long
day
with
if
he
had
left
himself
up
there
walking
along
hour
after
hour
or
lying
out
in
the
sun
beside
her
what
was
old
stormer
talking
about
the
difference
between
the
greek
and
roman
views
of
honour
always
in
the
to
think
the
present
was
bad
form
and
he
said
we
met
some
english
grundys
sir
on
the
ah
yes
any
particular
brand
some
advanced
and
some
not
but
all
the
same
i
think
i
see
grundys
i
think
you
said
yes
sir
from
this
hotel
it
was
stormer
name
for
them
they
were
so
very
there
was
something
unusual
in
the
tone
of
that
little
word
and
the
boy
the
first
time
there
seemed
a
real
man
standing
there
then
the
blood
rushed
up
into
his
cheeks
for
there
she
was
would
she
come
up
to
them
how
splendid
she
was
looking
burnt
by
the
sun
and
walking
as
if
just
starting
but
she
passed
into
the
hotel
without
turning
her
head
their
way
had
he
offended
hurt
her
he
made
an
excuse
and
got
away
to
his
room
in
the
window
from
which
that
same
morning
he
had
watched
the
mountains
lying
out
like
lions
in
the
dim
light
he
stood
again
and
gazed
at
the
sun
dropping
over
the
high
horizon
what
had
happened
to
him
he
felt
so
different
so
utterly
different
it
was
another
world
and
the
most
strange
feeling
came
on
him
as
of
the
flowers
falling
again
all
over
his
face
and
neck
and
hands
the
tickling
of
their
edges
the
stinging
sweetness
of
their
scent
and
he
seemed
to
hear
her
voice
saying
feel
and
to
feel
her
heart
once
more
beating
under
his
hand
vi
alone
with
that
figure
in
the
silent
church
anna
did
not
pray
resting
there
on
her
knees
she
experienced
only
the
sore
sensation
of
revolt
why
had
fate
flung
this
feeling
into
her
heart
lighted
up
her
life
suddenly
if
god
refused
her
its
enjoyment
some
of
the
mountain
pinks
remained
clinging
to
her
belt
and
the
scent
of
them
crushed
against
her
warred
with
the
faint
odour
of
age
and
incense
while
they
were
there
with
their
enticement
and
their
memories
prayer
would
never
come
but
did
she
want
to
pray
did
she
desire
the
mood
of
that
poor
soul
in
her
black
shawl
who
had
not
moved
by
one
breadth
since
she
had
been
watching
her
who
seemed
resting
her
humble
self
so
utterly
letting
life
lift
from
her
feeling
the
relief
of
nothingness
ah
yes
what
would
it
be
to
have
a
life
so
toilsome
so
little
exciting
from
day
to
day
and
hour
to
hour
that
just
to
kneel
there
in
wistful
stupor
was
the
greatest
pleasure
one
could
know
it
was
beautiful
to
see
her
but
it
was
sad
and
there
came
over
anna
a
longing
to
go
up
to
her
neighbour
and
say
tell
me
your
troubles
we
are
both
she
had
lost
a
son
perhaps
some
perhaps
not
really
love
only
some
illusion
ah
love
why
should
any
spirit
yearn
why
should
any
body
full
of
strength
and
joy
wither
slowly
away
for
want
of
love
was
there
not
enough
in
this
great
world
for
her
anna
to
have
a
little
she
would
not
harm
him
for
she
would
know
when
he
had
had
enough
of
her
she
would
surely
have
the
pride
and
grace
then
to
let
him
go
for
of
course
he
would
get
tired
of
her
at
her
age
she
could
never
hope
to
hold
a
boy
more
than
a
few
perhaps
but
would
she
ever
hold
him
at
all
youth
was
so
had
no
heart
and
then
the
memory
of
his
eyes
came
up
troubled
almost
she
had
dropped
on
him
those
flowers
that
memory
filled
her
with
a
sort
of
delirium
one
look
from
her
then
one
touch
and
he
would
have
clasped
her
to
him
she
was
sure
of
it
yet
scarcely
dared
to
believe
what
meant
so
much
and
suddenly
the
torment
that
she
must
go
through
whatever
happened
seemed
to
her
too
brutal
and
undeserved
she
rose
just
one
gleam
of
sunlight
was
still
slanting
through
the
doorway
it
failed
by
a
yard
or
so
to
reach
the
kneeling
countrywoman
and
anna
watched
would
it
steal
on
and
touch
her
or
would
the
sun
pass
down
behind
the
mountains
and
it
fade
away
unconscious
of
that
issue
the
figure
knelt
never
moving
and
the
beam
crept
on
if
it
touches
her
then
he
will
love
me
if
only
for
an
hour
if
it
fades
out
too
and
the
beam
crept
on
that
shadowy
path
of
light
with
its
dancing
was
it
indeed
charged
with
the
augury
of
love
or
darkness
and
slowly
moving
it
mounted
the
sun
sinking
it
rose
above
that
bent
head
hovered
in
a
golden
mist
suddenly
was
gone
unsteadily
seeing
nothing
plain
anna
walked
out
of
the
church
why
she
passed
her
husband
and
the
boy
on
the
terrace
without
a
look
she
could
not
quite
have
because
the
tortured
does
not
salute
her
torturers
when
she
reached
her
room
she
felt
deadly
tired
and
lying
down
on
her
bed
almost
at
once
fell
asleep
she
was
wakened
by
a
sound
and
recognizing
the
delicate
of
her
husband
knock
did
not
answer
indifferent
whether
he
came
in
or
no
he
entered
noiselessly
if
she
did
not
let
him
know
she
was
awake
he
would
not
wake
her
she
lay
still
and
watched
him
sit
down
astride
of
a
chair
cross
his
arms
on
its
back
rest
his
chin
on
them
and
fix
his
eyes
on
her
through
her
veil
of
eyelashes
she
had
unconsciously
contrived
that
his
face
should
be
the
one
object
plainly
more
intensely
visualized
because
of
this
queer
isolation
she
did
not
feel
at
all
ashamed
of
this
mutual
fixed
scrutiny
in
which
she
had
such
advantage
he
had
never
shown
her
what
was
in
him
never
revealed
what
lay
behind
those
bright
satiric
eyes
now
perhaps
she
would
see
and
she
lay
regarding
him
with
the
intense
excited
absorption
with
which
one
looks
at
a
tiny
wildflower
through
a
and
watches
its
insignificance
expanded
to
the
size
and
importance
of
a
hothouse
bloom
in
her
mind
was
this
thought
he
is
looking
at
me
with
his
real
self
since
he
has
no
reason
for
armour
against
me
now
at
first
his
eyes
seemed
masked
with
their
customary
brightness
his
whole
face
with
its
usual
decorous
formality
then
gradually
he
became
so
changed
that
she
hardly
knew
him
that
decorousness
that
brightness
melted
off
what
lay
behind
as
frosty
dew
melts
off
grass
and
her
very
soul
contracted
within
her
as
if
she
had
become
identified
with
what
he
was
something
to
be
passed
over
a
very
nothing
yes
his
was
the
face
of
one
looking
at
what
was
unintelligible
and
therefore
negligible
at
that
which
had
no
soul
at
something
of
a
different
and
inferior
species
and
of
no
great
interest
to
a
man
his
face
was
like
a
soundless
avowal
of
some
conclusion
so
fixed
and
intimate
that
it
must
surely
emanate
from
the
very
core
of
instinctive
unchangeable
this
was
the
real
he
a
man
despising
women
her
first
thought
was
and
a
fate
her
second
if
he
feels
that
perhaps
thousands
of
men
do
am
i
and
all
women
really
what
they
think
us
the
conviction
in
his
infected
her
and
she
gave
in
to
it
for
the
moment
crushed
then
her
spirit
revolted
with
such
turbulence
and
the
blood
so
throbbed
in
her
that
she
could
hardly
lie
still
how
dare
he
think
her
like
nothing
a
bundle
of
soulless
inexplicable
whims
and
moods
and
sensuality
a
thousand
times
no
it
was
he
who
was
the
soulless
one
the
dry
the
godless
one
who
in
his
sickening
superiority
could
thus
deny
her
and
with
her
all
women
that
stare
was
as
if
he
saw
doll
tricked
out
in
garments
labelled
soul
spirit
rights
responsibilities
dignity
so
many
words
it
was
vile
it
was
horrible
that
he
should
see
her
thus
and
a
really
terrific
struggle
began
in
her
between
the
desire
to
get
up
and
cry
this
out
and
the
knowledge
that
it
would
be
stupid
undignified
even
mad
to
show
her
comprehension
of
what
he
would
never
admit
or
even
understand
that
he
had
revealed
to
her
and
then
a
sort
of
cynicism
came
to
her
rescue
what
a
funny
thing
was
married
have
lived
all
these
years
with
him
and
never
known
what
was
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
she
had
the
feeling
now
that
if
she
went
up
to
him
and
said
i
am
in
love
with
that
boy
it
would
only
make
him
droop
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
say
in
his
most
satiric
voice
really
that
is
very
interesting
not
change
in
one
iota
his
real
thoughts
of
her
only
confirm
him
in
the
conviction
that
she
was
negligible
inexplicable
an
inferior
strange
form
of
animal
of
no
real
interest
to
him
and
then
just
when
she
felt
that
she
could
not
hold
herself
in
any
longer
he
got
up
passed
on
tiptoe
to
the
door
opened
it
noiselessly
and
went
out
the
moment
he
had
gone
she
jumped
up
so
then
she
was
linked
to
one
for
whom
she
for
whom
women
did
not
as
it
were
exist
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
stumbled
on
knowledge
of
almost
sacred
importance
on
the
key
of
everything
that
had
been
puzzling
and
hopeless
in
their
married
life
if
he
really
secretly
despised
her
the
only
feeling
she
need
have
for
one
so
dry
so
narrow
so
basically
stupid
was
just
contempt
but
she
knew
well
enough
that
contempt
would
not
shake
what
she
had
seen
in
his
face
he
was
impregnably
walled
within
his
clever
dull
conviction
of
superiority
he
was
for
ever
intrenched
and
she
would
always
be
only
the
assailant
did
it
matter
now
usually
swift
almost
careless
she
was
a
long
time
that
evening
over
her
toilette
her
neck
was
very
sunburnt
and
she
lingered
doubtful
whether
to
hide
it
with
powder
or
accept
her
gipsy
colouring
she
did
accept
it
for
she
saw
that
it
gave
her
eyes
so
like
glacier
ice
under
their
black
lashes
and
her
hair
with
its
surprising
glints
of
flame
colour
a
peculiar
value
when
the
rang
she
passed
her
husband
door
without
as
usual
knocking
and
went
down
alone
in
the
hall
she
noticed
some
of
the
english
party
of
the
mountain
hut
they
did
not
greet
her
conceiving
an
immediate
interest
in
the
barometer
but
she
could
feel
them
staring
at
her
very
hard
she
sat
down
to
wait
and
at
once
became
conscious
of
the
boy
coming
over
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
rather
like
a
person
walking
in
his
sleep
he
said
not
a
word
but
how
he
looked
and
her
heart
began
to
beat
was
this
the
moment
she
had
longed
for
if
it
indeed
had
come
dared
she
take
it
then
she
saw
her
husband
descending
the
stairs
saw
him
greet
the
english
party
heard
the
intoning
of
their
drawl
she
looked
up
at
the
boy
and
said
quickly
was
it
a
happy
day
it
gave
her
such
delight
to
keep
that
look
on
his
face
that
look
as
if
he
had
forgotten
everything
except
just
the
sight
of
her
his
eyes
seemed
to
have
in
them
something
holy
at
that
moment
something
of
the
of
nature
and
of
innocence
it
was
dreadful
to
know
that
in
a
moment
that
look
must
be
gone
perhaps
never
to
come
back
on
his
look
so
precious
her
husband
was
approaching
now
let
him
see
if
he
would
let
him
see
that
someone
could
she
was
not
to
everyone
a
kind
of
lower
animal
yes
he
must
have
seen
the
boy
face
and
yet
his
expression
never
changed
he
noticed
nothing
or
was
it
that
he
disdained
to
notice
vii
then
followed
for
young
lennan
a
strange
time
when
he
never
knew
from
minute
to
minute
whether
he
was
trying
to
be
with
her
restless
if
he
could
not
be
sore
if
she
talked
with
and
smiled
at
others
yet
when
he
was
with
her
restless
too
unsatisfied
suffering
from
his
own
timidity
one
wet
morning
when
she
was
playing
the
hotel
piano
and
he
listening
thinking
to
have
her
to
himself
there
came
a
young
german
and
with
a
brown
coat
longish
hair
and
little
a
beast
in
fact
soon
of
course
this
young
beast
was
asking
her
to
accompany
if
anyone
wanted
to
hear
him
play
his
disgusting
violin
every
word
and
smile
that
she
gave
him
hurt
so
seeing
how
much
more
interesting
than
himself
this
foreigner
was
and
his
heart
grew
heavier
and
heavier
and
he
thought
if
she
likes
him
i
ought
not
to
i
do
mind
how
can
i
help
minding
it
was
hateful
to
see
her
smiling
and
the
young
beast
bending
down
to
her
and
they
were
talking
german
so
that
he
could
not
tell
what
they
were
saying
which
made
it
more
unbearable
he
had
not
known
there
could
be
such
torture
and
then
he
began
to
want
to
hurt
her
too
but
that
was
how
could
he
hurt
her
she
did
not
care
for
him
he
was
nothing
to
a
boy
if
she
really
thought
him
only
a
boy
who
felt
so
would
be
horrible
it
flashed
across
him
that
she
might
be
playing
that
young
violinist
against
him
no
she
never
would
do
that
but
the
young
beast
looked
just
the
sort
that
might
take
advantage
of
her
smiles
if
only
he
would
do
something
that
was
not
respectful
how
splendid
it
would
be
to
ask
him
to
come
for
a
walk
in
the
woods
and
having
told
him
why
give
him
a
thrashing
afterwards
he
would
not
tell
her
he
would
not
try
to
gain
credit
by
it
he
would
keep
away
till
she
wanted
him
back
but
suddenly
the
thought
of
what
he
would
feel
if
she
really
meant
to
take
this
young
man
as
her
friend
in
place
of
him
became
so
actual
so
poignant
so
horribly
painful
that
he
got
up
abruptly
and
went
towards
the
door
would
she
not
say
a
word
to
him
before
he
got
out
of
the
room
would
she
not
try
and
keep
him
if
she
did
not
surely
it
would
be
all
over
it
would
mean
that
anybody
was
more
to
her
than
he
that
little
journey
to
the
door
indeed
seemed
like
a
march
to
execution
would
she
not
call
after
him
he
looked
back
she
was
smiling
but
he
could
not
smile
she
had
hurt
him
too
much
turning
his
head
away
he
went
out
and
dashed
into
the
rain
bareheaded
the
feeling
of
it
on
his
face
gave
him
a
sort
of
dismal
satisfaction
soon
he
would
be
wet
through
perhaps
he
would
get
out
here
far
away
from
his
people
she
would
have
to
offer
to
nurse
him
and
in
his
illness
he
would
seem
to
her
again
more
interesting
than
that
young
beast
and
if
only
he
could
be
ill
he
mounted
rapidly
through
the
dripping
leaves
towards
the
foot
of
the
low
mountain
that
rose
behind
the
hotel
a
trail
went
up
there
to
the
top
and
he
struck
into
it
going
at
a
great
pace
his
sense
of
injury
began
dying
away
he
no
longer
wanted
to
be
ill
the
rain
had
stopped
the
sun
came
out
he
went
on
up
and
up
he
would
get
to
the
top
quicker
than
anyone
ever
had
it
was
something
he
could
do
better
than
that
young
beast
the
gave
way
to
stunted
larches
and
these
to
pine
scrub
and
bare
scree
up
which
he
scrambled
clutching
at
the
tough
bushes
terribly
out
of
breath
his
heart
pumping
the
sweat
streaming
into
his
eyes
he
had
no
feeling
now
but
wonder
whether
he
would
get
to
the
top
before
he
dropped
exhausted
he
thought
he
would
die
of
the
beating
of
his
heart
but
it
was
better
to
die
than
to
stop
and
be
beaten
by
a
few
yards
he
stumbled
up
at
last
on
to
the
little
plateau
at
the
top
for
full
ten
minutes
he
lay
there
on
his
face
without
moving
then
rolled
over
his
heart
had
given
up
that
terrific
thumping
he
breathed
luxuriously
stretched
out
his
arms
along
the
steaming
happy
it
was
wonderful
up
here
with
the
sun
burning
hot
in
a
sky
already
how
tiny
everything
looked
trees
village
toy
things
he
had
never
before
felt
the
sheer
joy
of
being
high
up
the
torn
and
driven
in
huge
white
shapes
along
the
mountains
to
the
south
were
like
an
army
of
giants
with
chariots
and
white
horses
hurrying
away
he
thought
suddenly
suppose
i
had
died
when
my
heart
pumped
so
would
it
have
mattered
the
least
bit
everything
would
be
going
on
just
the
same
the
sun
shining
the
blue
up
there
the
same
and
those
toy
things
down
in
the
that
jealousy
of
his
an
hour
ago
was
himself
nothing
what
did
it
matter
if
she
were
nice
to
that
fellow
in
the
brown
coat
what
did
anything
matter
when
the
whole
thing
was
so
he
such
a
tiny
scrap
of
it
on
the
edge
of
the
plateau
to
mark
the
highest
point
someone
had
erected
a
rude
cross
which
jutted
out
stark
against
the
blue
sky
it
looked
cruel
somehow
sagged
all
crooked
and
out
of
place
up
here
a
piece
of
bad
manners
as
if
people
with
only
one
idea
had
dragged
it
in
without
caring
whether
or
no
it
suited
what
was
around
it
one
might
just
as
well
introduce
one
of
these
rocks
into
that
jolly
dark
church
where
he
had
left
her
the
other
day
as
put
a
cross
up
here
a
sound
of
bells
and
of
sniffing
and
scuffling
roused
him
a
large
grey
goat
had
come
up
and
was
smelling
at
his
leader
of
a
flock
that
were
soon
all
round
him
solemnly
curious
with
their
queer
yellow
eyes
and
their
quaint
little
beards
and
tails
awfully
decent
friendly
what
jolly
things
to
model
he
lay
still
having
learnt
from
the
fisherman
his
guardian
that
necessary
habit
in
the
presence
of
all
beasts
while
the
leader
sampled
the
flavour
of
his
neck
the
passage
of
that
long
rough
tongue
athwart
his
skin
gave
him
an
agreeable
sensation
awakened
a
strange
deep
sense
of
comradeship
he
restrained
his
desire
to
stroke
the
creature
nose
it
appeared
that
they
now
all
wished
to
taste
his
neck
but
some
were
timid
and
the
touch
of
their
tongues
simply
a
tickle
so
that
he
was
compelled
to
laugh
and
at
that
peculiar
sound
they
withdrew
and
gazed
at
him
there
seemed
to
be
no
one
with
them
then
at
a
little
distance
quite
motionless
in
the
shade
of
a
rock
he
spied
the
goatherd
a
boy
about
his
own
age
how
lonely
he
must
be
up
here
all
day
perhaps
he
talked
to
his
goats
he
looked
as
if
he
might
one
would
get
to
have
queer
thoughts
up
here
get
to
know
the
rocks
and
clouds
and
beasts
and
what
they
all
meant
the
goatherd
uttered
a
peculiar
whistle
and
something
lennan
could
not
tell
exactly
what
happened
among
the
sort
of
here
sir
seemed
to
come
from
them
and
then
the
goatherd
moved
out
from
the
shade
and
went
over
to
the
edge
of
the
plateau
and
two
of
the
goats
that
were
feeding
there
thrust
their
noses
into
his
hand
and
rubbed
themselves
against
his
legs
the
three
looked
beautiful
standing
there
together
on
the
edge
against
the
sky
that
night
after
dinner
the
was
cleared
for
dancing
so
that
the
guests
might
feel
freedom
and
gaiety
in
the
air
and
indeed
presently
a
couple
began
sawing
up
and
down
over
the
polished
boards
in
the
apologetic
manner
peculiar
to
hotel
guests
then
three
pairs
of
italians
suddenly
launched
themselves
into
and
twirling
and
glaring
into
each
other
eyes
and
some
americans
stimulated
by
their
precept
began
airily
backing
and
filling
two
of
the
grundys
with
carefully
amused
faces
next
moved
out
to
lennan
it
seemed
that
they
all
danced
very
well
better
than
he
could
did
he
dare
ask
her
then
he
saw
the
young
violinist
go
up
saw
her
rise
and
take
his
arm
and
vanish
into
the
and
leaning
his
forehead
against
a
with
a
sick
beaten
feeling
he
stayed
looking
out
into
the
moonlight
seeing
nothing
he
heard
his
name
spoken
his
tutor
was
standing
beside
him
you
and
i
lennan
must
console
each
other
dancing
for
the
young
eh
fortunately
it
was
the
boy
instinct
and
his
training
not
to
show
his
feelings
to
be
pleasant
though
suffering
yes
sir
jolly
moonlight
is
it
out
there
ah
very
jolly
yes
when
i
was
your
age
i
twirled
the
light
fantastic
with
the
best
but
gradually
lennan
one
came
to
see
it
could
not
be
done
without
a
was
the
rub
tell
you
regard
women
as
responsible
beings
i
should
like
to
have
your
opinion
on
it
was
of
course
there
was
something
in
those
i
think
it
you
sir
who
ought
to
give
me
my
dear
experience
is
a
mere
nothing
that
was
meant
for
unkindness
to
her
he
would
not
answer
if
only
stormer
would
go
away
the
music
had
stopped
they
would
be
sitting
out
somewhere
talking
he
made
an
effort
and
said
i
was
up
the
hill
at
the
back
this
morning
where
the
cross
is
there
were
some
jolly
and
suddenly
he
saw
her
coming
she
was
smiling
it
struck
him
that
her
frock
was
the
same
colour
as
the
moonlight
harold
will
you
dance
he
would
say
and
she
would
be
gone
again
but
his
tutor
only
made
her
a
little
bow
and
said
with
that
smile
of
his
lennan
and
i
have
agreed
that
dancing
is
for
the
sometimes
the
old
must
sacrifice
themselves
mark
will
you
dance
behind
him
he
heard
his
tutor
murmur
ah
betray
me
that
little
silent
journey
with
her
to
the
was
the
happiest
moment
perhaps
that
he
had
ever
known
and
he
need
not
have
been
so
much
afraid
about
his
dancing
truly
it
was
not
polished
but
it
could
not
spoil
hers
so
light
firm
buoyant
it
was
wonderful
to
dance
with
her
only
when
the
music
stopped
and
they
sat
down
did
he
know
how
his
head
was
going
round
he
felt
strange
very
strange
indeed
he
heard
her
say
what
is
it
dear
boy
you
look
so
white
without
quite
knowing
what
he
did
he
bent
his
face
towards
the
hand
that
she
had
laid
on
his
sleeve
then
knew
no
more
having
fainted
viii
growing
in
the
morning
that
was
all
he
was
himself
very
quickly
and
walked
up
to
bed
without
assistance
rotten
of
him
never
was
anyone
more
ashamed
of
his
little
weakness
than
this
boy
now
that
he
was
really
a
trifle
indisposed
he
simply
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
being
nursed
at
all
or
tended
almost
rudely
he
had
got
away
only
when
he
was
in
bed
did
he
remember
the
look
on
her
face
as
he
left
her
how
wistful
and
unhappy
seeming
to
implore
him
to
forgive
her
as
if
there
were
anything
to
forgive
as
if
she
had
not
made
him
perfectly
happy
when
she
danced
with
him
he
longed
to
say
to
her
if
i
might
be
close
to
you
like
that
one
minute
every
day
then
i
do
mind
all
the
rest
perhaps
he
would
dare
say
that
lying
there
he
still
felt
a
little
funny
he
had
forgotten
to
close
the
ribs
of
the
blinds
and
moonlight
was
filtering
in
but
he
was
too
idle
too
drowsy
to
get
up
now
and
do
it
they
had
given
him
brandy
rather
a
perhaps
was
the
reason
he
felt
so
queer
not
ill
but
mazy
as
if
dreaming
as
if
he
had
lost
the
desire
ever
to
move
again
just
to
lie
there
and
watch
the
powdery
moonlight
and
hear
faraway
music
throbbing
down
below
and
still
feel
the
touch
of
her
as
in
the
dance
she
swayed
against
him
and
all
the
time
to
have
the
scent
about
him
of
flowers
his
thoughts
were
dreams
his
dreams
precious
unreality
and
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
moonlight
was
gathered
into
a
single
slip
of
was
a
thrumming
a
throbbing
and
that
shape
of
moonlight
moved
towards
him
it
came
so
close
that
he
felt
its
warmth
against
his
brow
it
sighed
hovered
drew
back
soundless
and
was
gone
he
must
have
fallen
then
into
dreamless
sleep
what
time
was
it
when
he
was
awakened
by
that
delicate
to
see
his
tutor
standing
in
the
with
a
cup
of
tea
was
young
lennan
all
right
yes
he
was
perfectly
all
be
down
directly
it
was
most
frightfully
good
of
stormer
to
come
he
really
did
want
anything
yes
yes
but
the
maimed
and
the
halt
must
be
attended
to
his
face
seemed
to
the
boy
very
kind
just
to
laugh
at
him
a
very
enough
and
it
was
awfully
decent
of
him
to
have
come
and
to
stand
there
while
he
drank
the
tea
he
was
really
all
right
but
for
a
little
headache
many
times
while
he
was
dressing
he
stood
still
trying
to
remember
that
white
slip
of
moonlight
was
it
moonlight
was
it
part
of
a
dream
or
was
it
could
it
have
been
she
in
her
frock
why
had
he
not
stayed
awake
he
would
not
dare
to
ask
her
and
now
would
never
know
whether
the
vague
memory
of
warmth
on
his
brow
had
been
a
kiss
he
breakfasted
alone
in
the
room
where
they
had
danced
there
were
two
letters
for
him
one
from
his
guardian
enclosing
money
and
complaining
of
the
shyness
of
the
trout
the
other
from
his
sister
the
man
she
was
engaged
was
a
budding
diplomat
attached
to
the
embassy
at
afraid
that
his
leave
was
going
to
be
curtailed
they
would
have
to
be
married
at
once
they
might
even
have
to
get
a
special
licence
it
was
lucky
mark
was
coming
back
so
soon
they
simply
must
have
him
for
best
man
the
only
bridesmaid
now
would
be
sylvia
sylvia
doone
why
she
was
only
a
kid
and
the
memory
of
a
little
girl
in
a
very
short
holland
frock
with
flaxen
hair
pretty
blue
eyes
and
a
face
so
fair
that
you
could
almost
see
through
it
came
up
before
him
but
that
of
course
was
six
years
ago
she
would
not
still
be
in
a
frock
that
showed
her
knees
or
wear
beads
or
be
afraid
of
bulls
that
were
never
there
it
was
stupid
being
best
might
have
got
some
decent
chap
and
then
he
forgot
there
was
she
out
on
the
terrace
in
his
rush
to
join
her
he
passed
several
of
the
grundys
who
stared
at
him
askance
indeed
his
conduct
of
the
night
before
might
well
have
upset
them
an
oxford
man
fainting
in
an
hotel
something
wrong
there
and
then
when
he
reached
her
he
did
find
courage
was
it
really
moonlight
all
but
it
was
warm
and
when
she
did
not
answer
that
he
had
within
him
just
the
same
light
intoxicated
feeling
as
after
he
had
won
a
race
at
school
but
now
came
a
dreadful
blow
his
tutor
old
guide
had
suddenly
turned
up
after
a
climb
with
a
party
of
germans
the
had
been
aroused
in
stormer
he
wished
to
start
that
afternoon
for
a
certain
hut
and
go
up
a
certain
peak
at
dawn
next
day
but
lennan
was
not
to
go
why
not
because
of
last
night
faint
and
because
forsooth
he
was
not
some
stupid
thing
they
called
expert
as
where
she
could
go
he
could
this
was
to
treat
him
like
a
child
of
course
he
could
go
up
this
rotten
mountain
it
was
because
she
did
not
care
enough
to
take
him
she
did
not
think
him
man
enough
did
she
think
that
he
could
not
climb
and
if
it
were
dangerous
she
ought
not
to
be
going
leaving
him
was
simply
cruel
but
she
only
smiled
and
he
flung
away
from
her
not
having
seen
that
all
this
grief
of
his
only
made
her
happy
and
that
afternoon
they
went
off
without
him
what
deep
dark
thoughts
he
had
then
what
passionate
hatred
of
his
own
youth
what
schemes
he
wove
by
which
she
might
come
back
and
find
him
some
mountain
far
more
dangerous
and
fatiguing
if
people
did
not
think
him
fit
to
climb
with
he
would
climb
by
himself
that
anyway
everyone
admitted
was
dangerous
and
it
would
be
her
fault
she
would
be
sorry
then
he
would
get
up
and
be
off
before
dawn
he
put
his
things
out
ready
and
filled
his
flask
the
moonlight
that
evening
was
more
wonderful
than
ever
the
mountains
like
great
ghosts
of
themselves
and
she
was
up
there
at
the
hut
among
them
it
was
very
long
before
he
went
to
sleep
brooding
over
his
not
to
sleep
at
all
so
as
to
be
ready
to
be
off
at
three
at
nine
he
woke
his
wrath
was
gone
he
only
felt
restless
and
ashamed
if
instead
of
flying
out
he
had
made
the
best
of
it
he
could
have
gone
with
them
as
far
as
the
hut
could
have
stayed
the
night
there
and
now
he
cursed
himself
for
being
such
a
fool
and
idiot
some
little
of
that
idiocy
he
could
perhaps
retrieve
if
he
started
for
the
hut
at
once
he
might
still
be
in
time
to
meet
them
coming
down
and
accompany
them
home
he
swallowed
his
coffee
and
set
off
he
knew
the
way
at
first
then
in
woods
lost
it
recovered
the
right
track
again
at
last
but
did
not
reach
the
hut
till
nearly
two
yes
the
party
had
made
the
ascent
that
had
been
seen
been
heard
jodelling
on
the
top
gewiss
gewiss
but
they
would
not
come
down
the
same
way
oh
no
they
would
be
going
home
down
to
the
west
and
over
the
other
pass
they
would
be
back
in
house
before
the
young
herr
himself
he
heard
this
oddly
almost
with
relief
was
it
the
long
walk
alone
or
being
up
there
so
high
or
simply
that
he
was
very
hungry
or
just
these
nice
friendly
folk
in
the
hut
and
their
young
daughter
with
her
fresh
face
queer
little
black
cloth
sailor
hat
with
long
ribbons
velvet
bodice
and
perfect
simple
manners
or
the
sight
of
the
little
cows
thrusting
their
broad
black
noses
against
her
hand
what
was
it
that
had
taken
away
from
him
all
his
restless
feeling
made
him
happy
and
content
he
did
not
know
that
the
newest
thing
always
fascinates
the
puppy
in
its
gambols
he
sat
a
long
while
after
lunch
trying
to
draw
the
little
cows
watching
the
sun
on
the
cheek
of
that
pretty
maiden
trying
to
talk
to
her
in
german
and
when
at
last
he
said
adieu
and
she
murmured
kuss
die
hand
adieu
there
was
quite
a
little
pang
in
his
heart
wonderful
and
queer
is
the
heart
of
a
man
for
all
that
as
he
neared
home
he
hastened
till
he
was
actually
running
why
had
he
stayed
so
long
up
there
she
would
be
would
expect
to
see
him
and
that
young
beast
of
a
violinist
would
be
with
her
perhaps
instead
he
reached
the
hotel
just
in
time
to
rush
up
and
dress
and
rush
down
to
dinner
ah
they
were
tired
no
resting
in
their
rooms
he
sat
through
dinner
as
best
he
could
got
away
before
dessert
and
flew
upstairs
for
a
minute
he
stood
there
doubtful
on
which
door
should
he
knock
then
timidly
he
tapped
on
hers
no
answer
he
knocked
loud
on
his
tutor
door
no
answer
they
were
not
back
then
not
back
what
could
that
mean
or
could
it
be
that
they
were
both
asleep
once
more
he
knocked
on
her
door
then
desperately
turned
the
handle
and
took
a
flying
glance
empty
tidy
untouched
not
back
he
turned
and
ran
downstairs
again
all
the
guests
were
streaming
out
from
dinner
and
he
became
entangled
with
a
group
of
grundys
discussing
a
climbing
accident
which
had
occurred
in
switzerland
he
listened
feeling
suddenly
quite
sick
one
of
them
the
short
grundy
with
the
rather
whispering
voice
said
to
him
all
alone
again
the
stormers
not
back
lennan
did
his
best
to
answer
but
something
had
closed
his
throat
he
could
only
shake
his
head
they
had
a
guide
i
think
said
the
grundy
this
time
lennan
managed
to
get
out
yes
stormer
i
fancy
is
quite
an
expert
and
turning
to
the
lady
whom
the
young
addressed
as
he
added
to
me
the
great
charm
of
was
always
the
freedom
from
the
mother
of
the
young
looking
at
lennan
with
her
eyes
answered
that
to
me
would
be
the
disadvantage
i
always
like
to
be
mixing
with
my
own
the
murmured
in
a
muffled
voice
dangerous
thing
that
to
an
hotel
and
they
went
on
talking
but
of
what
lennan
no
longer
knew
lost
in
this
sudden
feeling
of
sick
fear
in
the
presence
of
these
grundys
so
superior
to
all
vulgar
sensations
he
could
not
give
vent
to
his
alarm
already
they
viewed
him
as
unsound
for
having
fainted
then
he
grasped
that
there
had
begun
all
round
him
a
sort
of
luxurious
speculation
on
what
might
have
happened
to
the
stormers
the
descent
was
very
nasty
there
was
a
particularly
bad
traverse
the
whose
collar
was
not
now
crumpled
said
he
did
not
believe
in
women
climbing
it
was
one
of
the
signs
of
the
times
that
he
most
deplored
the
mother
of
the
young
countered
him
at
once
in
practice
she
agreed
that
they
were
out
of
place
but
theoretically
she
could
not
see
why
they
should
not
climb
an
american
standing
near
threw
all
into
confusion
by
saying
he
guessed
that
it
might
be
liable
to
develop
their
understandings
lennan
made
for
the
front
door
the
moon
had
just
come
up
over
in
the
south
and
exactly
under
it
he
could
see
their
mountain
what
visions
he
had
then
he
saw
her
lying
dead
saw
himself
climbing
down
in
the
moonlight
and
raising
her
but
form
from
some
perilous
ledge
even
that
was
almost
better
than
this
actuality
of
not
knowing
where
she
was
or
what
had
happened
people
passed
out
into
the
moonlight
looking
curiously
at
his
set
face
staring
so
fixedly
one
or
two
asked
him
if
he
were
anxious
and
he
answered
oh
no
thanks
soon
there
would
have
to
be
a
search
party
how
soon
he
would
he
must
be
of
it
they
should
not
stop
him
this
time
and
suddenly
he
thought
ah
it
is
all
because
i
stayed
up
there
this
afternoon
talking
to
that
girl
all
because
i
forgot
her
and
then
he
heard
a
stir
behind
him
there
they
were
coming
down
the
passage
from
a
side
in
front
with
her
alpenstock
and
instinctively
he
recoiled
behind
some
plants
they
passed
her
sunburned
face
with
its
high
and
its
eyes
looked
so
happy
smiling
tired
triumphant
somehow
he
could
not
bear
it
and
when
they
were
gone
by
he
stole
out
into
the
wood
and
threw
himself
down
in
shadow
burying
his
face
and
choking
back
a
horrible
dry
sobbing
that
would
keep
rising
in
his
throat
ix
next
day
he
was
happy
for
all
the
afternoon
he
lay
out
in
the
shade
of
that
same
wood
at
her
feet
gazing
up
through
it
was
so
wonderful
with
nobody
but
nature
near
nature
so
alive
and
busy
and
so
big
coming
down
from
the
hut
the
day
before
he
had
seen
a
peak
that
looked
exactly
like
the
figure
of
a
woman
with
a
garment
over
her
head
the
biggest
statue
in
the
world
from
further
down
it
had
become
the
figure
of
a
bearded
man
with
his
arm
bent
over
his
eyes
had
she
seen
it
had
she
noticed
how
all
the
mountains
in
moonlight
or
very
early
morning
took
the
shape
of
beasts
what
he
wanted
most
in
life
was
to
be
able
to
make
images
of
beasts
and
creatures
of
all
sorts
that
were
gave
out
the
spirit
so
that
by
just
looking
at
them
one
could
have
all
those
jolly
feelings
one
had
when
one
was
watching
trees
and
beasts
and
rocks
and
even
some
sorts
of
not
grundys
so
he
was
quite
determined
to
study
art
oh
yes
of
course
he
would
want
to
then
no
oh
no
only
some
day
he
would
have
to
she
answered
some
never
get
away
and
he
said
quickly
of
course
i
shall
never
want
to
leave
oxford
while
you
are
he
heard
her
draw
her
breath
in
sharply
oh
yes
you
will
now
help
me
up
and
she
led
the
way
back
to
the
hotel
he
stayed
out
on
the
terrace
when
she
had
gone
in
restless
and
unhappy
the
moment
he
was
away
from
her
a
voice
close
by
said
well
friend
study
or
blue
devils
which
there
in
one
of
those
high
wicker
chairs
that
insulate
their
occupants
from
the
world
he
saw
his
tutor
leaning
back
head
a
little
to
one
side
and
tips
of
fingers
pressed
together
he
looked
like
an
idol
sitting
there
inert
and
he
had
gone
up
that
mountain
cheer
up
you
will
break
your
neck
yet
when
i
was
your
age
i
remember
feeling
it
deeply
that
i
was
not
allowed
to
risk
the
lives
of
lennan
stammered
out
i
did
think
of
that
but
i
thought
where
stormer
could
go
i
ah
for
all
our
admiration
we
can
not
quite
we
when
it
comes
to
the
point
the
boy
loyalty
broke
into
flame
it
not
that
i
think
stormer
as
good
as
any
not
quite
so
good
as
you
eh
a
hundred
times
better
stormer
smiled
ironic
beast
lennan
he
said
distrust
of
course
i
know
i
no
good
at
climbing
the
boy
broke
out
again
thought
where
she
was
allowed
to
risk
her
life
i
ought
to
be
good
i
like
it
was
said
so
entirely
without
irony
for
once
that
the
boy
was
disconcerted
you
are
young
brother
lennan
his
tutor
went
on
now
at
what
age
do
you
consider
men
develop
discretion
because
there
is
just
one
thing
always
worth
have
none
of
that
better
part
of
i
think
women
are
the
best
things
in
the
world
the
boy
blurted
out
may
you
long
have
that
opinion
his
tutor
had
risen
and
was
ironically
surveying
his
knees
a
bit
stiff
he
said
let
me
know
when
you
change
your
views
i
never
shall
ah
ah
never
is
a
long
word
lennan
i
am
going
to
have
some
tea
and
gingerly
he
walked
away
quizzing
as
it
were
with
a
smile
his
own
stiffness
lennan
remained
where
he
was
with
burning
cheeks
his
tutor
words
again
had
seemed
directed
against
her
how
could
a
man
say
such
things
about
women
if
they
were
true
he
did
not
want
to
know
if
they
were
not
true
it
was
wicked
to
say
them
it
must
be
awful
never
to
have
generous
feelings
always
to
have
to
be
satirical
dreadful
to
be
like
the
grundys
only
different
of
course
because
after
all
old
stormer
was
much
more
interesting
and
so
much
more
only
just
as
some
never
get
away
had
she
that
superiority
just
down
below
were
a
family
of
peasants
scything
and
gathering
in
the
grass
one
could
imagine
her
doing
that
and
looking
beautiful
with
a
coloured
handkerchief
over
her
head
one
could
imagine
her
doing
anything
could
not
imagine
old
stormer
doing
anything
but
what
he
did
do
and
suddenly
the
boy
felt
miserable
oppressed
by
these
dim
glimmerings
of
lives
misplaced
and
he
resolved
that
he
would
not
be
like
stormer
when
he
was
old
no
he
would
rather
be
a
regular
beast
than
be
like
that
when
he
went
to
his
room
to
change
for
dinner
he
saw
in
a
glass
of
water
a
large
clove
carnation
who
had
put
it
there
who
could
have
put
it
she
it
had
the
same
scent
as
the
mountain
pinks
she
had
dropped
over
him
but
deeper
scent
moving
dark
and
sweet
he
put
his
lips
to
it
before
he
pinned
it
into
his
coat
there
was
dancing
again
that
couples
this
time
and
a
violin
beside
the
piano
and
she
had
on
a
black
frock
he
had
never
seen
her
in
black
her
face
and
neck
were
powdered
over
their
sunburn
the
first
sight
of
that
powder
gave
him
a
faint
shock
he
had
not
somehow
thought
that
ladies
ever
put
on
powder
but
if
she
it
must
be
right
and
his
eyes
never
left
her
he
saw
the
young
german
violinist
hovering
round
her
even
dancing
with
her
twice
watched
her
dancing
with
others
but
all
without
jealousy
without
troubling
all
in
a
sort
of
dream
what
was
it
had
he
been
bewitched
into
that
queer
state
bewitched
by
the
gift
of
that
flower
in
his
coat
what
was
it
when
he
danced
with
her
that
kept
him
happy
in
her
silence
and
his
own
there
was
no
expectation
in
him
of
anything
that
she
would
say
or
expectation
no
desire
even
when
he
wandered
out
with
her
on
to
the
terrace
even
when
they
went
down
the
bank
and
sat
on
a
bench
above
the
fields
where
the
peasants
had
been
scything
he
had
still
no
feeling
but
that
quiet
dreamy
adoration
the
night
was
black
and
dreamy
too
for
the
moon
was
still
well
down
behind
the
mountains
the
little
band
was
playing
the
next
waltz
but
he
sat
not
moving
not
thinking
as
if
all
power
of
action
and
thought
had
been
stolen
out
of
him
and
the
scent
of
the
flower
in
his
coat
rose
for
there
was
no
wind
suddenly
his
heart
stopped
beating
she
had
leaned
against
him
he
felt
her
shoulder
press
his
arm
her
hair
touch
his
cheek
he
closed
his
eyes
then
and
turned
his
face
to
her
he
felt
her
lips
press
his
mouth
with
a
swift
burning
kiss
he
sighed
stretched
out
his
arms
there
was
nothing
there
but
air
the
rustle
of
her
dress
against
the
grass
was
all
the
too
was
gone
x
not
one
minute
all
that
night
did
anna
sleep
was
it
remorse
that
kept
her
awake
or
the
intoxication
of
memory
if
she
felt
that
her
kiss
had
been
a
crime
it
was
not
against
her
husband
or
herself
but
against
the
murder
of
illusion
of
something
sacred
but
she
could
not
help
feeling
a
delirious
happiness
too
and
the
thought
of
trying
to
annul
what
she
had
done
did
not
even
occur
to
her
he
was
ready
then
to
give
her
a
little
love
ever
so
little
compared
to
hers
but
still
a
little
there
could
be
no
other
meaning
to
that
movement
of
his
face
with
the
closed
eyes
as
if
he
would
nestle
it
down
on
her
breast
was
she
ashamed
of
her
little
manoeuvres
of
these
last
few
of
having
smiled
at
the
young
violinist
of
that
late
return
from
the
mountain
climb
of
the
flower
she
had
given
him
of
all
the
conscious
siege
she
had
laid
since
the
evening
her
husband
came
in
and
sat
watching
her
without
knowing
that
she
saw
him
no
not
really
ashamed
her
remorse
rose
only
from
the
kiss
it
hurt
to
think
of
that
because
it
was
death
the
final
extinction
of
the
in
her
the
awakening
knew
the
boy
for
if
she
was
mysterious
to
him
what
was
he
not
to
her
with
his
eagerness
and
his
dreaminess
his
youthful
warmth
his
innocence
what
if
it
had
killed
in
him
trust
brushed
off
the
dew
tumbled
a
star
down
could
she
forgive
herself
for
that
could
she
bear
it
if
she
were
to
make
him
like
so
many
other
boys
like
that
young
violinist
just
a
cynical
youth
looking
on
women
as
what
they
called
game
but
could
she
make
him
into
he
ever
grow
like
that
oh
surely
not
or
she
would
not
have
loved
him
from
the
moment
she
first
set
eyes
on
him
and
spoke
of
him
as
angel
after
that
crime
if
it
were
the
dark
she
had
not
known
what
he
had
done
where
wandering
perhaps
straight
up
to
his
room
why
had
she
refrained
left
him
there
vanished
out
of
his
arms
this
she
herself
hardly
understood
not
shame
not
fear
reverence
what
for
the
illusion
the
mystery
all
that
made
love
beautiful
for
youth
and
the
poetry
of
it
just
for
the
sake
of
the
black
still
night
itself
and
the
scent
of
that
flower
of
passion
that
had
won
him
to
her
and
that
she
had
stolen
back
and
now
wore
all
night
long
close
to
her
neck
and
in
the
morning
placed
withered
within
her
dress
she
had
been
starved
so
long
and
so
long
waited
for
that
was
little
wonder
if
she
did
not
clearly
know
why
she
had
done
just
this
and
not
that
and
now
how
should
she
meet
him
how
first
look
into
his
eyes
would
they
have
changed
would
they
no
longer
have
the
straight
look
she
so
loved
it
would
be
for
her
to
lead
to
make
the
future
and
she
kept
saying
to
herself
i
am
not
going
to
be
afraid
it
is
done
i
will
take
what
life
offers
of
her
husband
she
did
not
think
at
all
but
the
first
moment
she
saw
the
boy
she
knew
that
something
from
outside
and
untoward
had
happened
since
that
kiss
he
came
up
to
her
indeed
but
he
said
nothing
stood
trembling
all
over
and
handed
her
a
telegram
that
contained
these
words
come
back
at
once
wedding
immediate
expect
you
day
after
the
words
grew
indistinct
even
as
she
read
them
and
the
boy
face
all
blurred
then
making
an
effort
she
said
quietly
of
course
you
must
go
you
can
not
miss
your
only
sister
without
protest
he
looked
at
her
and
she
could
hardly
bear
that
seemed
to
know
so
little
and
ask
so
much
she
said
it
is
a
few
days
you
will
come
back
or
we
will
come
to
his
face
brightened
at
once
will
you
really
come
to
us
soon
at
they
ask
you
then
i
and
then
he
stopped
choking
she
said
again
ask
us
we
will
he
seized
her
hand
pressed
and
pressed
it
in
both
his
own
then
stroked
it
gently
and
said
oh
i
hurting
it
she
laughed
not
wishing
to
cry
in
a
few
minutes
he
would
have
to
start
to
catch
the
only
train
that
would
get
him
home
in
time
she
went
and
helped
him
to
pack
her
heart
felt
like
lead
but
not
able
to
bear
that
look
on
his
face
again
she
kept
cheerfully
talking
of
their
return
asking
about
his
home
how
to
get
to
it
speaking
of
oxford
and
next
term
when
his
things
were
ready
she
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
for
a
moment
pressed
him
to
her
then
she
escaped
looking
back
from
his
door
she
saw
him
standing
exactly
as
when
she
had
withdrawn
her
arms
her
cheeks
were
wet
she
dried
them
as
she
went
downstairs
when
she
felt
herself
safe
she
went
out
on
the
terrace
her
husband
was
there
and
she
said
to
him
will
you
come
with
me
into
the
town
i
want
to
buy
some
he
raised
his
eyebrows
smiled
dimly
and
followed
her
they
walked
slowly
down
the
hill
into
the
long
street
of
the
little
town
all
the
time
she
talked
of
she
knew
not
what
and
all
the
time
she
thought
his
carriage
will
carriage
will
pass
several
carriages
went
jingling
by
at
last
he
came
sitting
there
and
staring
straight
before
him
he
did
not
see
them
she
heard
her
husband
say
hullo
where
is
our
young
friend
lennan
off
to
with
his
like
a
lion
cub
in
trouble
she
answered
in
a
voice
that
she
tried
to
make
clear
and
steady
there
must
be
something
wrong
or
else
it
is
his
sister
she
felt
that
her
husband
was
gazing
at
her
and
wondered
what
her
face
was
like
but
at
that
moment
the
word
madre
sounded
close
in
her
ear
and
they
were
surrounded
by
a
small
drove
of
grundys
xi
that
twenty
mile
drive
was
perhaps
the
worst
part
of
the
journey
for
the
boy
it
is
always
hard
to
sit
still
and
suffer
when
anna
left
him
the
night
before
he
had
wandered
about
in
the
dark
not
knowing
quite
where
he
went
then
the
moon
came
up
and
he
found
himself
sitting
under
the
eave
of
a
barn
close
to
a
chalet
where
all
was
dark
and
quiet
and
down
below
him
the
valley
roofs
and
spires
and
little
glamorous
unreal
lights
in
his
evening
suit
his
dark
ruffled
hair
uncovered
he
would
have
made
a
quaint
spectacle
for
the
owners
of
that
chalet
if
they
had
chanced
to
see
him
seated
on
the
boards
against
their
barn
staring
before
him
with
such
wistful
rapture
but
they
were
folk
to
whom
sleep
was
precious
and
now
it
was
all
snatched
away
from
him
relegated
to
some
immensely
future
would
it
indeed
be
possible
to
get
his
guardian
to
ask
them
down
to
hayle
and
would
they
really
come
his
tutor
would
surely
never
care
to
visit
a
place
right
away
in
the
from
books
and
everything
he
frowned
thinking
of
his
tutor
but
it
was
with
other
feeling
and
yet
if
he
could
not
have
them
down
there
how
could
he
wait
the
two
whole
months
till
next
term
began
so
went
his
thoughts
round
and
round
while
the
horses
jogged
dragging
him
further
and
further
from
her
it
was
better
in
the
train
the
distraction
of
all
the
strange
crowd
of
foreigners
the
interest
of
new
faces
and
new
country
and
then
long
night
of
it
snoozed
up
in
his
corner
thoroughly
fagged
out
and
next
day
more
new
country
more
new
faces
and
slowly
his
mood
changing
from
ache
and
bewilderment
to
a
sense
of
something
promised
delightful
to
look
forward
to
then
calais
at
last
and
a
in
a
wet
little
steamer
a
summer
gale
blowing
spray
in
his
face
waves
leaping
white
in
a
black
sea
and
the
wild
sound
of
the
wind
on
again
to
london
the
early
drive
across
the
town
still
sleepy
in
august
haze
an
english
chops
marmalade
and
at
last
the
train
for
home
at
all
events
he
could
write
to
her
and
tearing
a
page
out
of
his
little
he
began
i
am
writing
in
the
train
so
please
forgive
this
joggly
then
he
did
not
know
how
to
go
on
for
all
that
he
wanted
to
say
was
such
as
he
had
never
even
dreamed
of
about
his
feelings
which
would
look
horrible
in
words
besides
he
must
not
put
anything
that
might
not
be
read
by
anyone
so
what
was
there
to
say
it
has
been
such
a
long
journey
he
wrote
at
last
away
from
the
tyrol
he
did
not
dare
even
to
put
from
you
i
thought
it
would
never
end
but
at
last
it
nearly
i
have
thought
a
great
deal
about
the
tyrol
it
was
a
lovely
loveliest
time
i
have
ever
had
and
now
it
over
i
try
to
console
myself
by
thinking
of
the
future
but
not
the
immediate
is
not
very
enjoyable
i
wonder
how
the
mountains
are
looking
please
give
my
love
to
them
especially
the
lion
ones
that
come
and
lie
out
in
the
will
not
recognize
them
from
this
followed
a
sketch
and
this
is
the
church
we
went
to
with
someone
kneeling
and
this
is
meant
for
the
grundys
looking
at
someone
who
is
coming
in
very
late
with
an
i
am
better
at
the
than
at
the
person
with
the
alpenstock
i
wish
i
were
the
grundys
now
still
in
the
tyrol
i
hope
i
shall
get
a
letter
from
you
soon
and
that
it
will
say
you
are
getting
ready
to
come
back
my
guardian
will
be
awfully
keen
for
you
to
come
and
stay
with
us
he
is
not
half
bad
when
you
know
him
and
there
will
be
his
sister
doone
and
her
daughter
left
there
after
the
wedding
it
will
be
simply
disgusting
if
you
and
stormer
do
come
i
wish
i
could
write
all
i
feel
about
my
lovely
time
in
the
tyrol
but
you
must
please
imagine
and
just
as
he
had
not
known
how
to
address
her
so
he
could
not
tell
how
to
subscribe
himself
and
only
put
mark
he
posted
the
letter
at
exeter
where
he
had
some
time
to
wait
and
his
mind
moved
still
more
from
past
to
future
now
that
he
was
nearing
home
he
began
to
think
of
his
sister
in
two
days
she
would
be
gone
to
italy
he
would
not
see
her
again
for
a
long
time
and
a
whole
crowd
of
memories
began
to
stretch
out
hands
to
him
how
she
and
he
used
to
walk
together
in
the
walled
garden
and
on
the
sunk
croquet
ground
she
telling
him
stories
her
arm
round
his
neck
because
she
was
two
years
older
and
taller
than
he
in
those
days
their
first
talk
each
holidays
when
he
came
back
to
her
the
first
unlimited
the
old
schoolroom
just
himself
and
her
and
old
tingle
miss
tring
the
ancient
governess
whose
chaperonage
would
now
be
gone
and
sometimes
that
kid
sylvia
when
she
chanced
to
be
staying
there
with
her
mother
cicely
had
always
understood
him
when
he
explained
to
her
how
inferior
school
was
because
nobody
took
any
interest
in
beasts
or
birds
except
to
kill
them
or
in
drawing
or
making
things
or
anything
decent
they
would
go
off
together
rambling
along
the
river
or
up
the
park
where
everything
looked
so
jolly
and
ragged
and
huge
boulders
of
whose
presence
old
godden
the
coachman
had
said
i
ca
think
but
what
these
been
washed
here
by
the
flood
mast
mark
these
and
a
thousand
other
memories
beset
his
conscience
now
and
as
the
train
drew
closer
to
their
station
he
eagerly
made
ready
to
jump
out
and
greet
her
there
was
the
honeysuckle
full
out
along
the
paling
of
the
platform
over
the
wonderful
this
there
was
she
standing
alone
on
the
platform
no
it
was
not
cicely
he
got
out
with
a
blank
sensation
as
if
those
memories
had
played
him
false
it
was
a
girl
indeed
but
she
only
looked
about
sixteen
and
wore
a
sunbonnet
that
hid
her
hair
and
half
her
face
she
had
on
a
blue
frock
and
some
honeysuckle
in
her
she
seemed
to
be
smiling
at
him
and
expecting
him
to
smile
at
her
and
so
he
did
smile
she
came
up
to
him
then
and
said
i
he
answered
oh
thanks
was
awfully
good
of
you
to
come
and
meet
cicely
so
busy
it
only
the
have
you
got
much
luggage
she
took
up
his
and
he
took
it
from
her
she
took
his
bag
and
he
took
it
from
her
then
they
went
out
to
the
a
small
groom
stood
there
holding
a
cob
with
a
black
mane
and
black
swish
tail
she
said
mind
if
i
drive
because
i
and
he
answered
oh
no
rather
she
got
up
he
noticed
that
her
eyes
looked
quite
excited
then
his
portmanteau
came
out
and
was
deposited
with
the
other
things
behind
and
he
got
up
beside
her
she
said
let
go
the
roan
rushed
past
the
little
groom
whose
top
boots
seemed
to
twinkle
as
he
jumped
up
behind
they
whizzed
round
the
corner
from
the
station
yard
and
observing
that
her
mouth
was
just
a
little
open
as
though
this
had
disconcerted
her
he
said
he
pulls
a
is
he
perfectly
sweet
he
is
rather
ah
when
she
came
he
would
drive
her
they
would
go
off
alone
in
the
and
he
would
show
her
all
the
country
round
he
was
by
the
words
oh
i
know
he
going
to
shy
at
once
there
was
a
swerve
the
roan
was
cantering
they
had
passed
a
pig
does
he
look
lovely
now
ought
i
to
have
whipped
him
when
he
shied
rather
why
because
horses
are
horses
and
pigs
are
pigs
it
natural
for
horses
to
shy
at
oh
he
looked
up
at
her
then
sidelong
the
curve
of
her
cheek
and
chin
looked
very
soft
and
rather
jolly
i
did
know
you
you
know
he
said
you
grown
up
so
i
knew
you
at
once
your
voice
is
still
there
was
another
silence
till
she
said
he
does
pull
he
going
home
shall
i
drive
yes
he
stood
up
and
took
the
reins
and
she
slipped
past
under
them
in
front
of
him
her
hair
smelt
exactly
like
hay
as
she
was
softly
bumped
against
him
she
kept
regarding
him
steadily
with
very
blue
eyes
now
that
she
was
relieved
of
driving
cicely
was
afraid
you
were
coming
she
said
suddenly
what
sort
of
people
are
those
old
stormers
he
felt
himself
grow
very
red
choked
something
down
and
answered
it
only
he
that
old
she
not
more
than
about
that
is
he
restrained
the
words
of
course
it
old
to
a
kid
like
you
and
instead
he
looked
at
her
was
she
exactly
a
kid
she
seemed
quite
tall
for
a
girl
and
not
very
thin
and
there
was
something
frank
and
soft
about
her
face
and
as
if
she
wanted
you
to
be
nice
to
her
is
she
very
pretty
this
time
he
did
not
go
red
such
was
the
disturbance
that
question
made
in
him
if
he
said
yes
it
was
like
letting
the
world
know
his
adoration
but
to
say
anything
less
would
be
horrible
disloyal
so
he
did
say
yes
listening
hard
to
the
tone
of
his
own
voice
i
thought
she
was
do
you
like
her
very
much
again
he
struggled
with
that
thing
in
his
throat
and
again
said
he
wanted
to
hate
this
girl
yet
somehow
could
looked
so
soft
and
confiding
she
was
staring
before
her
now
her
lips
still
just
parted
so
evidently
that
had
not
been
because
of
bolero
pulling
they
were
pretty
all
the
same
and
so
was
her
short
straight
little
nose
and
her
chin
and
she
was
awfully
fair
his
thoughts
flew
back
to
that
other
splendid
so
full
of
life
suddenly
he
found
himself
unable
to
picture
the
first
time
since
he
had
started
on
his
journey
it
would
not
come
before
him
oh
look
her
hand
was
pulling
at
his
arm
there
in
the
field
over
the
hedge
a
buzzard
hawk
was
dropping
like
a
stone
oh
mark
oh
oh
it
got
it
she
was
covering
her
face
with
both
her
hands
and
the
hawk
with
a
young
rabbit
in
its
claws
was
sailing
up
again
it
looked
so
beautiful
that
he
did
not
somehow
feel
sorry
for
the
rabbit
but
he
wanted
to
stroke
and
comfort
her
and
said
it
all
right
sylvia
it
really
is
the
rabbit
dead
already
you
know
and
it
quite
she
took
her
hands
away
from
a
face
that
looked
just
as
if
she
were
going
to
cry
poor
little
rabbit
it
was
such
a
little
one
xii
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
following
he
sat
in
the
with
a
prayer
book
in
his
hand
and
a
frown
on
his
forehead
reading
the
marriage
service
the
book
had
been
effectively
designed
for
not
spoiling
the
figure
when
carried
in
a
pocket
but
this
did
not
matter
for
even
if
he
could
have
read
the
words
he
would
not
have
known
what
they
meant
seeing
that
he
was
thinking
how
he
could
make
a
certain
petition
to
a
certain
person
sitting
just
behind
at
a
large
bureau
with
a
sliding
top
examining
artificial
flies
he
fixed
at
last
upon
this
form
gordy
why
gordy
no
one
quite
knew
because
his
name
was
george
or
by
way
of
corruption
from
guardian
when
cis
is
gone
be
rather
awful
wo
it
not
a
heatherley
was
a
man
of
perhaps
if
indeed
guardians
have
ages
and
like
a
doctor
rather
than
a
squire
his
face
square
and
puffy
his
eyes
always
and
his
curly
mouth
using
bluntly
a
voice
of
that
refined
coarseness
peculiar
to
people
of
old
family
but
it
will
you
know
well
supposin
it
is
i
only
wondered
if
you
mind
asking
and
stormer
to
come
here
for
a
were
awfully
kind
to
me
out
strange
man
and
woman
my
dear
fellow
mr
stormer
likes
does
he
and
what
does
she
like
very
grateful
that
his
back
was
turned
the
boy
said
i
do
awfully
ah
pretty
he
answered
faintly
i
do
know
what
you
call
pretty
he
felt
rather
than
saw
his
guardian
scrutinizing
him
with
those
eyes
under
their
gouty
lids
all
right
do
as
you
like
have
here
and
have
done
with
it
by
all
did
his
heart
jump
not
quite
but
it
felt
warm
and
happy
and
he
said
thanks
awfully
gordy
it
most
frightfully
decent
of
you
and
turned
again
to
the
marriage
service
he
could
make
out
some
of
it
in
places
it
seemed
to
him
fine
and
in
other
places
queer
about
obeying
for
instance
if
you
loved
anybody
it
seemed
rotten
to
expect
them
to
obey
you
if
you
loved
them
and
they
loved
you
there
could
ever
be
any
question
of
obeying
because
you
would
both
do
the
things
always
of
your
own
accord
and
if
they
did
love
you
or
you
them
then
it
would
be
simply
too
disgusting
for
anything
to
go
on
living
with
a
person
you
did
love
or
who
did
love
you
but
of
course
she
did
love
his
tutor
had
she
once
those
bright
doubting
eyes
that
studiously
satiric
mouth
came
very
clearly
up
before
him
you
could
not
love
them
and
was
really
very
decent
a
feeling
as
of
pity
almost
of
affection
rose
in
him
for
his
remote
tutor
it
was
queer
to
feel
so
since
the
last
time
they
had
talked
together
out
there
on
the
terrace
he
had
not
felt
at
all
like
that
the
noise
of
the
bureau
top
sliding
down
aroused
him
heatherley
was
closing
in
the
remains
of
the
artificial
flies
that
meant
he
would
be
going
out
to
fish
and
the
moment
he
heard
the
door
shut
mark
sprang
up
slid
back
the
bureau
top
and
began
to
write
his
letter
it
was
hard
work
dear
stormer
my
guardian
wishes
me
to
beg
you
and
stormer
to
pay
us
a
visit
as
soon
as
you
come
back
from
the
tyrol
please
tell
stormer
that
only
the
very
best
catch
our
trout
the
rest
catch
our
trees
this
is
me
catching
our
trees
here
followed
a
sketch
my
sister
is
going
to
be
married
and
it
will
be
disgusting
afterwards
unless
you
come
so
do
come
please
and
with
my
very
best
greetings
i
am
your
humble
servant
m
when
he
had
stamped
this
production
and
dropped
it
in
the
he
had
the
oddest
feeling
as
if
he
had
been
let
out
of
school
a
desire
to
rush
about
to
frolic
what
should
he
do
cis
of
course
would
be
were
all
busy
about
the
wedding
he
would
go
and
saddle
bolero
and
jump
him
in
the
park
or
should
he
go
down
along
the
river
and
watch
the
jays
both
seemed
lonely
occupations
and
he
stood
in
the
at
the
age
of
five
walking
with
his
nurse
he
had
been
overheard
remarking
nurse
i
want
to
eat
a
the
way
i
want
to
eat
a
biscuit
and
it
was
still
rather
so
with
him
the
way
he
wanted
to
eat
a
biscuit
he
bethought
him
then
of
his
modelling
and
went
out
to
the
little
empty
greenhouse
where
he
kept
his
masterpieces
they
seemed
to
him
now
quite
two
of
them
the
sheep
and
the
turkey
he
marked
out
for
summary
destruction
the
idea
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
try
and
model
that
hawk
escaping
with
the
little
rabbit
but
when
he
tried
no
nice
feeling
came
and
flinging
the
things
down
he
went
out
he
ran
along
the
unweeded
path
to
the
tennis
tennis
was
then
just
coming
in
the
grass
looked
very
rough
but
then
everything
about
that
little
manor
house
was
left
rather
wild
and
anyhow
why
nobody
quite
knew
and
nobody
seemed
to
mind
he
stood
there
scrutinizing
the
condition
of
the
ground
a
sound
of
humming
came
to
his
ears
he
got
up
on
the
wall
there
was
sylvia
sitting
in
the
field
making
a
wreath
of
honeysuckle
he
stood
very
quiet
and
listened
she
looked
in
her
tune
then
he
slid
down
off
the
wall
and
said
gently
hallo
she
looked
round
at
him
her
eyes
very
wide
open
your
voice
is
jolly
sylvia
oh
no
it
is
come
and
climb
a
tree
where
in
the
park
of
they
were
some
time
selecting
the
tree
many
being
too
easy
for
him
and
many
too
hard
for
her
but
one
was
found
at
last
an
oak
of
great
age
and
frequented
by
rooks
then
insisting
that
she
must
be
roped
to
him
he
departed
to
the
house
for
some
the
climb
began
at
four
by
him
the
ascent
of
the
cimone
della
pala
he
led
the
momentous
expedition
taking
a
hitch
of
the
round
a
branch
before
he
permitted
her
to
move
two
or
three
times
he
was
obliged
to
make
the
cord
fast
and
return
to
help
her
for
she
was
not
an
her
arms
seemed
soft
and
she
was
inclined
to
straddle
instead
of
trusting
to
one
foot
but
at
last
they
were
settled
streaked
indeed
with
moss
on
the
top
branch
but
two
they
rested
there
silent
listening
to
the
rooks
soothing
an
outraged
dignity
save
for
this
slowly
subsiding
demonstration
it
was
marvellously
peaceful
and
remote
up
there
to
a
blue
sky
thinly
veiled
from
them
by
the
crinkled
leaves
the
peculiar
dry
mossy
smell
of
an
was
disturbed
into
the
air
by
the
least
motion
of
their
feet
or
hands
against
the
bark
they
could
hardly
see
the
ground
and
all
around
other
gnarled
trees
barred
off
any
view
he
said
if
we
stay
up
here
till
it
dark
we
might
see
oh
no
owls
are
horrible
what
they
the
white
i
ca
stand
their
eyes
and
they
squeak
so
when
they
oh
but
that
so
jolly
and
their
eyes
are
they
always
catching
mice
and
little
chickens
all
sorts
of
little
but
they
do
mean
to
they
only
want
them
to
eat
do
you
think
things
are
jolliest
at
night
she
slipped
her
arm
in
his
no
i
do
like
the
why
not
it
things
get
he
dwelt
lovingly
on
that
word
i
do
like
mysterious
things
they
frighten
oh
sylvia
no
i
like
early
in
spring
when
it
beginning
to
get
well
of
she
was
leaning
against
him
for
safety
just
a
little
and
stretching
out
his
arm
he
took
good
hold
of
the
branch
to
make
a
back
for
her
there
was
a
silence
then
he
said
if
you
could
only
have
one
tree
which
would
you
have
not
oaks
which
would
you
he
pondered
there
were
so
many
trees
that
were
perfect
birches
and
limes
of
course
but
beeches
and
cypresses
and
yews
and
cedars
and
and
then
he
said
suddenly
pines
i
mean
the
big
ones
with
reddish
stems
and
branches
pretty
high
why
again
he
pondered
it
was
very
important
to
explain
exactly
why
his
feelings
about
everything
were
concerned
in
this
and
while
he
mused
she
gazed
at
him
as
if
surprised
to
see
anyone
think
so
deeply
at
last
he
said
because
they
independent
and
dignified
and
never
quite
cold
and
their
branches
seem
to
brood
but
chiefly
because
the
ones
i
mean
are
generally
out
of
the
common
where
you
find
them
you
one
or
two
strong
and
dark
standing
out
against
the
they
too
it
occurred
to
him
suddenly
that
he
had
forgotten
larches
they
of
course
could
be
heavenly
when
you
lay
under
them
and
looked
up
at
the
sky
as
he
had
that
afternoon
out
there
then
he
heard
her
say
if
i
could
only
have
one
flower
i
should
have
lilies
of
the
valley
the
small
ones
that
grow
wild
and
smell
so
he
had
a
swift
vision
of
another
flower
different
and
was
silent
what
would
you
have
mark
her
voice
sounded
a
little
hurt
you
are
thinking
of
one
are
you
he
said
honestly
yes
i
which
it
dark
too
you
would
care
for
it
a
how
know
a
clove
but
i
do
like
very
he
nodded
solemnly
i
knew
you
then
a
silence
fell
between
them
she
had
ceased
to
lean
against
him
and
he
missed
the
cosy
friendliness
of
it
now
that
their
voices
and
the
cawings
of
the
rooks
had
ceased
there
was
nothing
heard
but
the
dry
rustle
of
the
leaves
and
the
plaintive
cry
of
a
buzzard
hawk
hunting
over
the
little
tor
across
the
river
there
were
nearly
always
two
up
there
quartering
the
sky
to
the
boy
it
was
lovely
that
nature
talking
to
always
talked
in
silences
the
beasts
the
birds
the
insects
only
really
showed
themselves
when
you
were
still
you
had
to
be
awfully
quiet
too
for
flowers
and
plants
otherwise
you
could
see
the
real
jolly
separate
life
there
was
in
them
even
the
boulders
down
there
that
old
godden
thought
had
been
washed
up
by
the
flood
never
showed
you
what
queer
shapes
they
had
and
let
you
feel
close
to
them
unless
you
were
thinking
of
nothing
else
sylvia
after
all
was
better
in
that
way
than
he
had
expected
she
could
keep
quiet
he
had
thought
girls
hopeless
she
was
gentle
and
it
was
rather
jolly
to
watch
her
through
the
leaves
there
came
the
faint
far
tinkle
of
the
she
said
we
must
get
it
was
much
too
jolly
to
go
in
really
but
if
she
wanted
her
always
wanted
tea
and
twisting
the
cord
carefully
round
the
branch
he
began
to
superintend
her
descent
about
to
follow
he
heard
her
cry
oh
mark
i
stuck
i
ca
reach
it
with
my
foot
swinging
and
he
saw
that
she
was
swinging
by
her
hands
and
the
cord
let
go
drop
on
to
the
branch
cord
hold
you
straight
till
you
grab
the
her
voice
mounted
piteously
i
really
should
slip
he
tied
the
cord
and
slithered
hastily
to
the
branch
below
her
then
bracing
himself
against
the
trunk
he
clutched
her
round
the
waist
and
knees
but
the
taut
cord
held
her
up
and
she
would
not
come
to
anchor
he
could
not
hold
her
and
untie
the
cord
which
was
fast
round
her
waist
if
he
let
her
go
with
one
hand
and
got
out
his
knife
he
would
never
be
able
to
cut
and
hold
her
at
the
same
time
for
a
moment
he
thought
he
had
better
climb
up
again
and
slack
off
the
cord
but
he
could
see
by
her
face
that
she
was
getting
frightened
he
could
feel
it
by
the
quivering
of
her
body
if
i
heave
you
up
he
said
can
you
get
hold
again
above
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
heaved
she
caught
hold
frantically
hold
on
just
for
a
she
did
not
answer
but
he
saw
that
her
face
had
gone
very
white
he
snatched
out
his
knife
and
cut
the
cord
she
clung
just
for
that
moment
then
came
loose
into
his
arms
and
he
hauled
her
to
him
against
the
trunk
safe
there
she
buried
her
face
on
his
shoulder
he
began
to
murmur
to
her
and
smooth
her
softly
with
quite
a
feeling
of
its
being
his
business
to
smooth
her
like
this
to
protect
her
he
knew
she
was
crying
but
she
let
no
sound
escape
and
he
was
very
careful
not
to
show
that
he
knew
for
fear
she
should
feel
ashamed
he
wondered
if
he
ought
to
kiss
her
at
last
he
did
on
the
top
of
her
head
very
gently
then
she
put
up
her
face
and
said
she
was
a
beast
and
he
kissed
her
again
on
an
eyebrow
after
that
she
seemed
all
right
and
very
gingerly
they
descended
to
the
ground
where
shadows
were
beginning
to
lengthen
over
the
fern
and
the
sun
to
slant
into
their
eyes
xiii
the
night
after
the
wedding
the
boy
stood
at
the
window
of
his
pleasant
attic
bedroom
with
one
wall
sloping
and
a
faint
smell
of
mice
he
was
tired
and
excited
and
his
brain
full
of
pictures
this
was
his
first
wedding
and
he
was
haunted
by
a
vision
of
his
sister
little
white
form
and
her
face
with
its
starry
eyes
she
was
no
more
how
fearful
the
wedding
march
had
sounded
on
that
awful
old
wheezer
and
the
sermon
one
did
want
to
hear
that
sort
of
thing
when
one
felt
inclined
to
cry
even
gordy
had
looked
rather
boiled
when
he
was
giving
her
away
with
perfect
distinctness
he
could
still
see
the
group
before
the
altar
rails
just
as
if
he
had
not
been
a
part
of
it
himself
cis
in
her
white
sylvia
in
fluffy
grey
his
impassive
tall
figure
gordy
looking
queer
in
a
black
coat
with
a
very
yellow
face
and
eyes
still
the
rotten
part
of
it
all
had
been
that
you
wanted
to
be
just
feeling
and
you
had
to
be
thinking
of
the
ring
and
your
gloves
and
whether
the
lowest
button
of
your
white
waistcoat
was
properly
undone
girls
could
do
both
it
seemed
to
be
seeing
something
wonderful
all
the
time
and
sylvia
had
looked
quite
holy
he
himself
had
been
too
conscious
of
the
rector
voice
and
the
sort
of
professional
manner
with
which
he
did
it
all
as
if
he
were
making
up
a
prescription
with
directions
how
to
take
it
and
yet
it
was
all
rather
beautiful
in
a
kind
of
fashion
every
face
turned
one
way
and
a
tremendous
for
poor
old
blowing
of
his
nose
with
his
enormous
red
handkerchief
and
the
soft
darkness
up
in
the
roof
and
down
in
the
pews
and
the
sunlight
brightening
the
south
windows
all
the
same
it
would
have
been
much
jollier
just
taking
hands
by
themselves
somewhere
and
saying
out
before
god
what
they
really
after
all
god
was
everything
everywhere
not
only
in
stuffy
churches
that
was
how
he
would
like
to
be
married
out
of
doors
on
a
starry
night
like
this
when
everything
felt
wonderful
all
round
you
surely
god
was
half
as
small
as
people
seemed
always
making
sort
of
superior
man
a
little
bigger
than
themselves
even
the
very
most
beautiful
and
wonderful
and
awful
things
one
could
imagine
or
make
could
only
be
just
nothing
to
a
god
who
had
a
temple
like
the
night
out
there
but
then
you
could
be
married
alone
and
no
girl
would
ever
like
to
be
married
without
rings
and
flowers
and
dresses
and
words
that
made
it
all
feel
small
and
cosy
cis
might
have
perhaps
only
she
would
because
of
not
hurting
other
feelings
but
would
be
afraid
only
of
course
she
was
young
and
the
thread
of
his
thoughts
scattered
like
beads
from
a
string
leaning
out
and
resting
his
chin
on
his
hands
he
drew
the
night
air
into
his
lungs
honeysuckle
or
was
it
the
scent
of
lilies
still
the
stars
all
out
and
lots
of
owls
at
least
what
would
night
be
like
without
owls
and
stars
but
that
was
never
could
think
what
things
would
be
like
if
they
were
just
what
and
where
they
were
you
never
knew
what
was
coming
either
and
yet
when
it
came
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
else
ever
could
have
come
that
was
could
do
anything
you
liked
until
you
done
it
but
when
you
had
done
it
then
you
knew
of
course
that
you
must
always
have
had
to
what
was
that
light
below
and
to
the
left
whose
room
old
the
little
spare
she
must
be
awake
then
he
leaned
far
out
and
whispered
in
the
voice
she
had
said
was
still
furry
sylvia
the
light
flickered
he
could
just
see
her
head
appear
with
hair
all
loose
and
her
face
turning
up
to
him
he
could
only
half
see
half
imagine
it
mysterious
blurry
and
he
whispered
is
this
jolly
the
whisper
travelled
back
are
you
sleepy
no
are
you
not
a
bit
hear
the
owls
does
it
smell
good
perfect
can
you
see
me
only
just
not
too
much
can
you
i
ca
see
your
nose
shall
i
get
the
candle
spoil
it
what
are
you
sitting
on
the
window
it
does
twist
your
neck
does
it
a
little
are
you
hungry
wait
half
a
shake
i
let
down
some
chocolate
in
my
big
bath
towel
it
swing
along
to
a
dim
white
arm
reached
out
catch
i
say
you
wo
get
cold
rather
it
too
jolly
to
sleep
is
it
mark
which
star
is
yours
mine
is
the
white
one
over
the
top
branch
of
the
big
sycamore
from
mine
is
that
twinkling
red
one
over
the
summer
house
sylvia
catch
oh
i
was
it
no
but
what
was
it
only
my
star
it
caught
in
your
oh
listen
silence
then
until
her
awed
whisper
what
and
his
floating
down
dying
away
cave
what
had
window
opened
cautiously
he
spied
along
the
face
of
the
dim
house
there
was
no
light
anywhere
nor
any
shifting
blur
of
white
at
her
window
below
all
was
dark
sweet
with
the
scent
of
something
jolly
and
then
he
saw
what
that
something
was
all
over
the
wall
below
his
window
white
jessamine
was
in
not
only
in
the
sky
perhaps
the
sky
was
really
a
field
of
white
flowers
and
god
walked
there
and
plucked
the
stars
the
next
morning
there
was
a
letter
on
his
plate
when
he
came
down
to
breakfast
he
could
open
it
with
sylvia
on
one
side
of
him
and
old
tingle
on
the
other
then
with
a
sort
of
anger
he
did
open
it
he
need
not
have
been
afraid
it
was
written
so
that
anyone
might
have
read
it
told
of
a
climb
of
bad
weather
said
they
were
coming
home
was
he
relieved
disturbed
pleased
at
their
coming
back
or
only
uneasily
ashamed
she
had
not
got
his
second
letter
yet
he
could
feel
old
tingle
looking
round
at
him
with
those
queer
sharp
twinkling
eyes
of
hers
and
sylvia
regarding
him
quite
frankly
and
conscious
that
he
was
growing
red
he
said
to
himself
wo
and
did
not
in
three
days
they
would
be
at
oxford
would
they
come
on
here
at
once
old
tingle
was
speaking
he
heard
sylvia
answer
no
i
do
like
so
hard
it
was
their
old
name
for
high
cheekbones
sylvia
certainly
had
none
her
cheeks
went
softly
up
to
her
eyes
do
you
mark
he
said
slowly
on
some
people
who
have
them
are
are
they
was
it
came
to
him
that
he
did
not
know
at
all
what
she
was
when
breakfast
was
over
and
he
had
got
away
to
his
old
greenhouse
he
had
a
strange
unhappy
time
he
was
a
beast
he
had
not
been
thinking
of
her
half
enough
he
took
the
letter
out
and
frowned
at
it
horribly
why
could
he
not
feel
more
what
was
the
matter
with
him
why
was
he
such
a
to
be
thinking
of
her
day
and
night
for
long
he
stood
disconsolate
in
the
little
dark
greenhouse
among
the
images
of
his
beasts
the
letter
in
his
hand
he
stole
out
presently
and
got
down
to
the
river
unobserved
crisp
gentle
sound
of
water
ever
so
comforting
to
sit
on
a
stone
very
still
and
wait
for
things
to
happen
round
you
you
lost
yourself
that
way
just
became
branches
and
stones
and
water
and
birds
and
sky
you
did
not
feel
such
a
beast
gordy
would
never
understand
why
he
did
not
care
for
thing
trying
to
catch
of
watching
and
understanding
what
things
were
you
never
got
to
the
end
of
looking
into
water
or
grass
or
fern
always
something
queer
and
new
it
was
like
that
too
with
yourself
if
you
sat
down
and
looked
awfully
interesting
to
see
things
working
in
your
mind
a
soft
rain
had
begun
to
fall
hissing
gently
on
the
leaves
but
he
had
still
a
boy
love
of
getting
wet
and
stayed
where
he
was
on
the
stone
some
people
saw
fairies
in
woods
and
down
in
water
or
said
they
did
that
did
not
seem
to
him
much
fun
what
was
really
interesting
was
noticing
that
each
thing
was
different
from
every
other
thing
and
what
made
it
so
you
must
see
that
before
you
could
draw
or
model
decently
it
was
fascinating
to
see
your
creatures
coming
out
with
shapes
of
their
very
own
they
did
that
without
your
understanding
how
but
this
vacation
he
was
no
draw
or
model
a
bit
a
jay
had
settled
about
forty
yards
away
and
remained
in
full
view
attending
to
his
feathers
of
all
things
birds
were
the
most
fascinating
he
watched
it
a
long
time
and
when
it
flew
on
followed
it
over
the
high
wall
up
into
the
park
he
heard
the
ring
in
the
far
distance
but
did
not
go
in
so
long
as
he
was
out
there
in
the
soft
rain
with
the
birds
and
trees
and
other
creatures
he
was
free
from
that
unhappy
feeling
of
the
morning
he
did
not
go
back
till
nearly
seven
properly
wet
through
and
very
hungry
all
through
dinner
he
noticed
that
sylvia
seemed
to
be
watching
him
as
if
wanting
to
ask
him
something
she
looked
very
soft
in
her
white
frock
open
at
the
neck
and
her
hair
almost
the
colour
of
special
moonlight
so
and
he
wanted
her
to
understand
that
it
a
bit
because
of
her
that
he
had
been
out
alone
all
day
after
dinner
when
they
were
getting
the
table
ready
to
play
nines
he
did
murmur
did
you
sleep
last
she
nodded
fervently
to
that
it
was
raining
really
hard
now
swishing
and
dripping
out
in
the
darkness
and
he
whispered
our
stars
would
be
drowned
do
you
really
think
we
have
stars
we
might
but
mine
safe
of
course
your
hair
is
jolly
she
gazed
at
him
very
sweet
and
surprised
xiv
anna
did
not
receive
the
boy
letter
in
the
tyrol
it
followed
her
to
oxford
she
was
just
going
out
when
it
came
and
she
took
it
up
with
the
mingled
beatitude
and
almost
sickening
tremor
that
a
lover
feels
touching
the
loved
one
letter
she
would
not
open
it
in
the
street
but
carried
it
all
the
way
to
the
garden
of
a
certain
college
and
sat
down
to
read
it
under
the
that
little
letter
so
short
boyish
and
dry
transported
her
halfway
to
heaven
she
was
to
see
him
again
at
once
not
to
wait
weeks
with
the
fear
that
he
would
quite
forget
her
her
husband
had
said
at
breakfast
that
oxford
without
dear
young
clowns
assuredly
was
charming
but
oxford
of
tourists
and
other
strange
bodies
as
certainly
was
not
where
should
they
go
thank
heaven
the
letter
could
be
shown
him
for
all
that
a
little
stab
of
pain
went
through
her
that
there
was
not
one
word
which
made
it
unsuitable
to
show
still
she
was
happy
never
had
her
favourite
college
garden
seemed
so
beautiful
with
each
tree
and
flower
so
cared
for
and
the
very
wind
excluded
never
had
the
birds
seemed
so
tame
and
friendly
the
sun
shone
softly
even
the
clouds
were
luminous
and
joyful
she
sat
a
long
time
musing
and
went
back
forgetting
all
she
had
come
out
to
do
having
both
courage
and
decision
she
did
not
leave
the
letter
to
burn
a
hole
in
her
corsets
but
gave
it
to
her
husband
at
lunch
looking
him
in
the
face
and
saying
carelessly
providence
you
see
answers
your
he
read
it
raised
his
eyebrows
smiled
and
without
looking
up
murmured
you
wish
to
prosecute
this
romantic
episode
did
he
mean
was
it
simply
his
way
of
putting
things
i
naturally
want
to
be
anywhere
but
perhaps
you
would
like
to
go
alone
he
said
that
of
course
knowing
she
could
not
say
yes
and
she
answered
simply
then
let
us
both
monday
i
will
catch
the
young
man
trout
thou
shalt
shall
is
it
he
good
that
and
three
days
later
without
another
word
exchanged
on
the
subject
they
started
was
she
grateful
to
him
no
afraid
of
him
no
scornful
of
him
not
quite
but
she
was
afraid
of
herself
horribly
how
would
she
ever
be
able
to
keep
herself
in
hand
how
disguise
from
these
people
that
she
loved
their
boy
it
was
her
desperate
mood
that
she
feared
but
since
she
so
much
wanted
all
the
best
for
him
that
life
could
give
surely
she
would
have
the
strength
to
do
nothing
that
might
harm
him
yet
she
was
afraid
he
was
there
at
the
station
to
meet
them
in
riding
things
and
a
nice
rough
norfolk
jacket
that
she
did
not
recognize
though
she
thought
she
knew
his
clothes
by
heart
and
as
the
train
came
slowly
to
a
standstill
the
memory
of
her
last
moment
with
him
up
in
his
room
amid
the
luggage
that
she
had
helped
to
pack
very
nearly
overcame
her
it
seemed
so
hard
to
have
to
meet
him
coldly
formally
to
have
to
knew
how
a
minute
with
him
alone
and
he
was
so
polite
so
beautifully
considerate
with
all
the
manners
of
a
host
hoping
she
was
tired
hoping
stormer
had
brought
his
though
they
had
lots
of
course
they
could
lend
him
hoping
the
weather
would
be
fine
hoping
that
they
would
mind
having
to
drive
three
miles
and
busying
himself
about
their
luggage
all
this
when
she
just
wanted
to
take
him
in
her
arms
and
push
his
hair
back
from
his
forehead
and
look
at
him
he
did
not
drive
with
had
thought
they
would
be
too
followed
keeping
quite
close
in
the
dust
to
point
out
the
scenery
mounted
on
a
as
her
husband
called
the
roan
with
the
black
swish
tail
this
countryside
so
rich
and
yet
a
little
wild
the
cottages
the
old
dark
cosy
all
was
very
new
to
one
used
to
oxford
and
to
london
and
to
little
else
of
england
and
all
was
delightful
even
mark
guardian
seemed
to
her
delightful
for
gordy
when
absolutely
forced
to
face
an
unknown
woman
could
bring
to
the
encounter
a
certain
bluff
ingratiation
his
sister
too
doone
with
her
faded
gentleness
seemed
soothing
when
anna
was
alone
in
her
room
reached
by
an
unexpected
little
stairway
she
stood
looking
at
its
carved
bed
and
the
wide
lattice
window
with
chintz
curtains
and
the
flowers
in
a
blue
bowl
yes
all
was
delightful
and
yet
what
was
it
what
had
she
missed
ah
she
was
a
fool
to
fret
it
was
only
his
anxiety
that
they
should
be
comfortable
his
fear
that
he
might
betray
himself
out
there
those
last
few
eyes
and
now
she
brooded
earnestly
over
what
dress
she
should
put
on
she
who
tanned
so
quickly
had
almost
lost
her
sunburn
in
the
week
of
travelling
and
oxford
her
eyes
looked
tired
and
she
was
pale
she
was
not
going
to
disdain
anything
that
might
help
she
had
reached
last
month
and
he
would
be
nineteen
she
decided
on
black
in
black
she
knew
that
her
neck
looked
whiter
and
the
colour
of
her
eyes
and
hair
stranger
she
put
on
no
jewellery
did
not
even
pin
a
rose
at
her
breast
took
white
gloves
since
her
husband
did
not
come
to
her
room
she
went
up
the
little
stairway
to
his
she
surprised
him
ready
dressed
standing
by
the
fireplace
smiling
faintly
what
was
he
thinking
of
standing
there
with
that
smile
was
there
blood
in
him
at
all
he
inclined
his
head
slightly
and
said
good
chaste
as
the
night
black
suits
you
shall
we
find
our
way
down
to
these
savage
halls
and
they
went
down
everyone
was
already
there
waiting
a
single
neighbouring
squire
and
magistrate
by
name
trusham
had
been
bidden
to
make
numbers
equal
dinner
was
announced
they
went
in
at
the
round
table
in
a
all
black
oak
with
many
candles
and
terrible
portraits
of
departed
ancestors
anna
sat
between
the
magistrate
and
gordy
mark
was
opposite
between
a
old
lady
and
a
young
girl
who
had
not
been
introduced
a
girl
in
white
with
very
fair
hair
and
very
white
skin
blue
eyes
and
lips
a
little
parted
a
daughter
evidently
of
the
faded
doone
a
girl
like
a
silvery
moth
like
a
anna
found
it
hard
to
take
her
eyes
away
from
this
girl
face
not
that
she
admired
her
exactly
pretty
she
but
weak
with
those
parted
lips
and
soft
chin
and
almost
wistful
look
as
if
her
eyes
were
in
spite
of
her
but
she
was
young
that
was
why
not
to
watch
her
seemed
impossible
sylvia
doone
indeed
yes
a
soft
name
a
pretty
very
like
her
every
time
her
eyes
could
travel
away
from
her
duty
to
squire
trusham
and
to
gordy
on
both
of
whom
she
was
clearly
making
an
impression
she
gazed
at
this
girl
sitting
there
by
the
boy
and
whenever
those
two
young
things
smiled
and
spoke
together
she
felt
her
heart
contract
and
hurt
her
was
this
why
that
something
had
gone
out
of
his
eyes
ah
she
was
foolish
if
every
girl
or
woman
the
boy
knew
was
to
cause
such
a
feeling
in
her
what
would
life
be
like
and
her
will
hardened
against
her
fears
she
was
looking
brilliant
herself
and
she
saw
that
the
girl
in
her
turn
could
not
help
gazing
at
her
eagerly
wistfully
a
little
young
and
the
boy
slowly
surely
as
a
magnet
draws
anna
could
feel
that
she
was
drawing
him
could
see
him
stealing
chances
to
look
at
her
once
she
surprised
him
full
what
troubled
eyes
it
was
not
the
old
adoring
face
yet
she
knew
from
its
expression
that
she
could
make
him
want
him
fire
him
with
her
kisses
if
she
would
and
the
dinner
wore
to
an
end
then
came
the
moment
when
the
girl
and
she
must
meet
under
the
eyes
of
the
mother
and
that
sharp
old
governess
it
would
be
a
hard
moment
that
and
it
hard
moment
and
a
long
one
for
gordy
sat
full
span
over
his
wine
but
anna
had
not
served
her
time
beneath
the
gaze
of
upper
oxford
for
nothing
she
managed
to
be
charming
full
of
interest
and
questions
in
her
still
rather
foreign
accent
miss
she
became
show
her
all
the
treasures
and
antiquities
was
it
too
dark
to
go
out
just
to
look
at
the
old
house
by
night
oh
no
not
a
bit
there
were
goloshes
in
the
hall
and
they
went
the
girl
leading
and
talking
of
anna
knew
not
what
so
absorbed
was
she
in
thinking
how
for
a
moment
just
a
moment
she
could
contrive
to
be
with
the
boy
alone
it
was
not
remarkable
this
old
house
but
it
was
his
some
day
perhaps
be
his
and
houses
at
night
were
strangely
alive
with
their
window
eyes
that
is
my
room
the
girl
said
where
the
jessamine
can
just
see
it
mark
is
under
where
the
eave
hangs
out
away
to
the
left
the
other
yes
the
other
night
oh
i
listen
that
an
owl
we
have
heaps
of
owls
mark
likes
them
i
do
always
mark
he
awfully
keen
you
see
about
all
beasts
and
models
them
shall
i
show
you
his
workshop
an
old
greenhouse
here
you
can
see
there
through
the
glass
anna
indeed
could
just
see
the
boy
quaint
creations
huddling
in
the
dark
on
a
bare
floor
a
grotesque
company
of
small
monsters
she
murmured
yes
i
see
them
but
i
wo
really
look
unless
he
brings
me
oh
he
sure
to
they
interest
him
more
than
anything
in
the
for
all
her
cautious
resolutions
anna
could
not
for
the
life
of
her
help
saying
what
more
than
you
the
girl
gave
her
a
wistful
stare
before
she
answered
oh
i
do
count
anna
laughed
and
took
her
arm
how
soft
and
young
it
felt
a
pang
went
through
her
heart
half
jealous
half
remorseful
do
you
know
she
said
that
you
are
very
sweet
the
girl
did
not
answer
are
you
his
cousin
no
gordy
is
only
mark
uncle
by
marriage
my
mother
is
i
nothing
i
what
you
english
call
connection
they
were
silent
seeming
to
examine
the
night
then
the
girl
said
i
wanted
to
see
you
awfully
you
not
like
what
i
oh
and
what
did
you
think
i
thought
you
would
have
dark
eyes
and
venetian
red
hair
and
not
be
quite
so
tall
of
course
i
have
any
they
were
at
the
door
again
when
the
girl
said
that
and
the
hall
light
was
falling
on
her
her
slip
of
a
white
figure
showed
clear
young
she
looked
everything
she
young
and
anna
murmured
and
you
than
i
thought
just
then
the
men
came
out
from
the
her
husband
with
the
look
on
his
face
that
denoted
he
had
been
well
listened
to
squire
trusham
laughing
as
a
man
does
who
has
no
sense
of
humour
gordy
having
a
curly
slightly
asphyxiated
air
and
the
boy
his
pale
brooding
look
as
though
he
had
lost
touch
with
his
surroundings
he
wavered
towards
her
seemed
to
lose
himself
went
and
sat
down
by
the
old
governess
was
it
because
he
did
not
dare
to
come
up
to
her
or
only
because
he
saw
the
old
lady
sitting
alone
it
might
well
be
that
and
the
evening
so
different
from
what
she
had
dreamed
of
closed
in
squire
trusham
was
gone
in
his
high
with
his
famous
mare
whose
exploits
had
entertained
her
all
through
dinner
her
candle
had
been
given
her
she
had
said
to
all
but
mark
what
should
she
do
when
she
had
his
hand
in
hers
she
would
be
alone
with
him
in
that
grasp
whose
strength
no
one
could
see
and
she
did
not
know
whether
to
clasp
it
passionately
or
to
let
it
go
coolly
back
to
its
owner
whether
to
claim
him
or
to
wait
but
she
was
unable
to
help
pressing
it
feverishly
at
once
in
his
face
she
saw
again
that
troubled
look
and
her
heart
smote
her
she
let
it
go
and
that
she
might
not
see
him
say
to
the
girl
turned
and
mounted
to
her
room
fully
dressed
she
flung
herself
on
the
bed
and
there
lay
her
handkerchief
across
her
mouth
gnawing
at
its
edges
xv
mark
nineteenth
birthday
rose
in
grey
mist
slowly
dropped
its
veil
to
the
grass
and
shone
clear
and
glistening
he
woke
early
from
his
window
he
could
see
nothing
in
the
steep
park
but
the
soft
oaks
suspended
one
above
the
other
among
the
boulders
it
was
in
early
morning
that
he
always
got
his
strongest
feeling
of
wanting
to
model
things
then
and
after
dark
when
for
want
of
light
it
was
no
use
this
morning
he
had
the
craving
badly
and
the
sense
of
not
knowing
how
weighed
down
his
spirit
his
drawings
his
were
all
so
bad
so
fumbly
if
only
this
had
been
his
birthday
and
he
had
his
money
and
could
do
what
he
liked
he
would
not
stay
in
england
he
would
be
off
to
athens
or
rome
or
even
to
paris
and
work
till
he
could
do
something
and
in
his
holidays
he
would
study
animals
and
birds
in
wild
countries
where
there
were
plenty
of
them
and
you
could
watch
them
in
their
haunts
it
was
stupid
having
to
stay
in
a
place
like
oxford
but
at
the
thought
of
what
oxford
meant
his
roaming
fancy
like
a
bird
hypnotized
by
a
hawk
fluttered
stayed
suspended
and
dived
back
to
earth
and
that
feeling
of
wanting
to
make
things
suddenly
left
him
it
was
as
though
he
had
woken
up
his
real
self
that
self
again
very
quietly
he
made
his
way
downstairs
the
garden
door
was
not
shuttered
not
even
must
have
been
forgotten
overnight
last
night
he
had
never
thought
he
would
feel
like
this
when
she
bewildered
and
confused
drawn
towards
her
but
by
something
held
back
and
he
felt
impatient
angry
with
himself
almost
with
her
why
could
he
not
be
just
simply
happy
as
this
morning
was
happy
he
got
his
and
searched
the
meadow
that
led
down
to
the
river
yes
there
were
several
rabbits
out
with
the
white
marguerites
and
the
dew
cobwebs
it
was
all
and
white
and
the
rabbits
being
there
made
it
perfect
he
wanted
one
badly
to
model
from
and
for
a
moment
was
tempted
to
get
his
rook
what
was
the
good
of
a
dead
they
looked
so
happy
he
put
the
glasses
down
and
went
towards
his
greenhouse
to
get
a
drawing
block
thinking
to
sit
on
the
wall
and
make
a
sort
of
midsummer
night
dream
sketch
of
flowers
and
rabbits
someone
was
there
bending
down
and
doing
something
to
his
creatures
who
had
the
cheek
why
it
was
her
he
grew
hot
then
cold
with
anger
he
could
not
bear
anyone
in
that
holy
place
it
was
hateful
to
have
his
things
even
looked
at
and
seemed
to
be
fingering
them
he
pulled
the
door
open
with
a
jerk
and
said
what
are
you
doing
he
was
indeed
so
stirred
by
righteous
wrath
that
he
hardly
noticed
the
gasp
she
gave
and
the
collapse
of
her
figure
against
the
wall
she
ran
past
him
and
vanished
without
a
word
he
went
up
to
his
creatures
and
saw
that
she
had
placed
on
the
head
of
each
one
of
them
a
little
sprig
of
jessamine
flower
why
it
was
idiotic
he
could
see
nothing
at
first
but
the
ludicrousness
of
flowers
on
the
heads
of
his
beasts
then
the
desperation
of
this
attempt
to
imagine
something
graceful
something
that
would
give
him
pleasure
touched
him
for
he
saw
now
that
this
was
a
birthday
decoration
from
that
it
was
only
a
second
before
he
was
horrified
with
himself
poor
little
sylvia
what
a
brute
he
was
she
had
plucked
all
that
jessamine
hung
out
of
her
window
and
risked
falling
to
get
hold
of
it
and
she
had
woken
up
early
and
come
down
in
her
just
to
do
something
that
she
thought
he
would
like
he
had
done
now
when
it
was
too
late
he
saw
only
too
clearly
her
startled
white
face
and
quivering
lips
and
the
way
she
had
shrunk
against
the
wall
how
pretty
she
had
looked
in
her
with
her
hair
all
about
her
frightened
like
that
he
would
do
anything
now
to
make
up
to
her
for
having
been
such
a
perfect
beast
the
feeling
always
a
little
with
him
that
he
must
look
after
no
doubt
from
days
when
he
had
protected
her
from
the
bulls
that
were
not
there
and
the
feeling
of
her
being
so
sweet
and
decent
to
him
always
and
some
other
feeling
these
suddenly
reached
poignant
climax
he
simply
must
make
it
up
to
her
he
ran
back
into
the
house
and
stole
upstairs
outside
her
room
he
listened
with
all
his
might
but
could
hear
nothing
then
tapped
softly
with
one
nail
and
putting
his
mouth
to
the
keyhole
whispered
sylvia
again
and
again
he
whispered
her
name
he
even
tried
the
handle
meaning
to
open
the
door
an
inch
but
it
was
bolted
once
he
thought
he
heard
a
noise
like
sobbing
and
this
made
him
still
more
wretched
at
last
he
gave
it
up
she
would
not
come
would
not
be
consoled
he
deserved
it
he
knew
but
it
was
very
hard
and
dreadfully
dispirited
he
went
up
to
his
room
took
a
bit
of
paper
and
tried
to
write
dearest
sylvia
it
was
most
awfully
sweet
of
you
to
put
your
stars
on
my
beasts
it
was
just
about
the
most
sweet
thing
you
could
have
done
i
am
an
awful
brute
but
of
course
if
i
had
only
known
what
you
were
doing
i
should
have
loved
it
do
forgive
me
i
deserve
it
i
it
is
my
birthday
your
sorrowful
he
took
this
down
slipped
it
under
her
door
tapped
so
that
she
might
notice
it
and
stole
away
it
relieved
his
mind
a
little
and
he
went
downstairs
again
back
in
the
greenhouse
sitting
on
a
stool
he
ruefully
contemplated
those
chapletted
beasts
they
consisted
of
a
crow
a
sheep
a
turkey
two
doves
a
pony
and
sundry
fragments
she
had
fastened
the
jessamine
sprigs
to
the
tops
of
their
heads
by
a
tiny
daub
of
wet
clay
and
had
evidently
been
surprised
trying
to
put
a
sprig
into
the
mouth
of
one
of
the
doves
for
it
hung
by
a
little
thread
of
clay
from
the
beak
he
detached
it
and
put
it
in
his
buttonhole
poor
little
sylvia
she
took
things
awfully
to
heart
he
would
be
as
nice
as
ever
he
could
to
her
all
day
and
balancing
on
his
stool
he
stared
fixedly
at
the
wall
against
which
she
had
fallen
back
the
line
of
her
soft
chin
and
throat
seemed
now
to
be
his
only
memory
it
was
very
queer
how
he
could
see
nothing
but
that
the
way
the
throat
moved
white
so
soft
and
he
had
made
it
go
like
that
it
seemed
an
unconscionable
time
till
breakfast
as
the
hour
approached
he
haunted
the
hall
hoping
she
might
be
first
down
at
last
he
heard
footsteps
and
waited
hidden
behind
the
door
of
the
empty
lest
at
sight
of
him
she
should
turn
back
he
had
rehearsed
what
he
was
going
to
down
and
kiss
her
hand
and
say
dulcinea
del
toboso
is
the
most
beautiful
lady
in
the
world
and
i
the
most
unfortunate
knight
upon
the
earth
from
his
favourite
passage
out
of
his
favourite
book
quixote
she
would
surely
forgive
him
then
and
his
heart
would
no
longer
hurt
him
certainly
she
could
never
go
on
making
him
so
miserable
if
she
knew
his
feelings
she
was
too
soft
and
gentle
for
that
alas
it
was
not
sylvia
who
came
but
anna
fresh
from
sleep
with
her
eyes
and
bright
hair
and
in
sudden
strange
antipathy
to
her
that
strong
vivid
figure
he
stood
dumb
and
this
first
lonely
moment
which
he
had
so
many
times
in
fancy
spent
locked
in
her
arms
passed
without
even
a
kiss
for
quickly
one
by
one
the
others
came
but
of
sylvia
only
news
through
doone
that
she
had
a
headache
and
was
staying
in
bed
her
present
was
on
the
sideboard
a
book
called
resartus
sylvia
august
together
with
gordy
cheque
doone
pearl
pin
old
of
venice
and
one
other
little
parcel
wrapped
in
ties
of
varying
shades
of
green
red
and
blue
in
present
of
how
many
hours
made
short
by
the
thought
that
he
would
wear
the
produce
of
that
clicking
he
did
not
fail
in
outer
gratitude
but
did
he
realize
what
had
been
knitted
into
those
ties
not
then
birthdays
like
christmas
days
were
made
for
disenchantment
always
the
false
gaiety
of
gaiety
that
pistol
to
the
head
you
enjoy
yourself
how
could
he
enjoy
himself
with
the
thought
of
sylvia
in
her
room
made
ill
by
his
brutality
the
vision
of
her
throat
working
swallowing
her
grief
haunted
him
like
a
little
white
soft
spectre
all
through
the
long
drive
out
on
to
the
moor
and
the
picnic
in
the
heather
and
the
long
drive
him
so
that
when
anna
touched
or
looked
at
him
he
had
no
spirit
to
answer
no
spirit
even
to
try
and
be
with
her
alone
but
almost
a
dread
of
it
instead
and
when
at
last
they
were
at
home
again
and
she
whispered
what
is
it
what
have
i
done
he
could
only
mutter
nothing
oh
nothing
it
only
that
i
been
a
brute
at
that
enigmatic
answer
she
might
well
search
his
face
is
it
my
husband
he
could
answer
that
at
all
events
oh
no
what
is
it
then
tell
they
were
standing
in
the
inner
porch
pretending
to
examine
the
ancestral
and
starred
with
dolphins
and
little
galleons
sailing
into
always
hung
just
there
tell
me
mark
i
do
like
to
suffer
what
could
he
say
since
he
did
not
know
himself
he
stammered
tried
to
speak
could
not
get
anything
out
is
it
that
girl
startled
he
looked
away
and
said
of
course
she
shivered
and
went
into
the
house
but
he
stayed
staring
at
the
chart
with
a
dreadful
shame
and
irritation
pity
impatience
fear
all
mixed
what
had
he
done
said
lost
it
was
that
horrid
feeling
of
when
one
has
not
been
kind
and
not
quite
true
yet
might
have
been
kinder
if
one
had
been
still
less
true
ah
but
it
was
all
so
mixed
up
it
felt
all
bleak
too
and
wintry
in
him
as
if
he
had
suddenly
lost
everybody
love
then
he
was
conscious
of
his
tutor
ah
friend
deeply
into
the
past
from
the
less
romantic
present
nice
things
those
old
charts
the
dolphins
are
extremely
it
was
difficult
to
remember
not
to
be
then
why
did
stormer
jeer
like
that
he
just
managed
to
answer
yes
sir
i
wish
we
had
some
there
are
so
many
moons
we
wish
for
lennan
and
they
none
of
them
come
tumbling
the
voice
was
almost
earnest
and
the
boy
resentment
fled
he
felt
sorry
but
why
he
did
not
know
in
the
meantime
he
heard
his
tutor
say
let
us
dress
for
when
he
came
down
to
the
anna
in
her
frock
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
talking
he
kept
away
from
them
they
could
neither
of
them
want
him
but
it
did
seem
odd
to
him
who
knew
not
too
much
concerning
women
that
she
could
be
talking
so
gaily
when
only
half
an
hour
ago
she
had
said
is
it
that
girl
he
sat
next
her
at
dinner
again
it
was
puzzling
that
she
should
be
laughing
so
serenely
at
gordy
stories
did
the
whispering
in
the
porch
then
mean
nothing
and
sylvia
would
not
look
at
him
he
felt
sure
that
she
turned
her
eyes
away
simply
because
she
knew
he
was
going
to
look
in
her
direction
and
this
roused
in
him
a
sore
that
night
seemed
to
rouse
that
injustice
he
was
cast
out
and
he
could
not
tell
why
he
had
not
meant
to
hurt
either
of
them
why
should
they
both
want
to
hurt
him
so
and
presently
there
came
to
him
a
feeling
that
he
did
not
care
let
them
treat
him
as
they
liked
there
were
other
things
besides
love
if
they
did
not
want
did
not
want
them
and
he
hugged
this
reckless
unhappy
feeling
to
him
with
all
the
abandonment
of
youth
but
even
birthdays
come
to
an
end
and
moods
and
feelings
that
seem
so
desperately
real
die
in
the
unreality
of
sleep
xvi
if
to
the
boy
that
birthday
was
all
bewildered
disillusionment
to
anna
it
was
verily
slow
torture
she
found
no
relief
in
thinking
that
there
were
things
in
life
other
than
love
but
next
morning
brought
readjustment
a
sense
of
yesterday
extravagance
a
renewal
of
hope
impossible
surely
that
in
one
short
fortnight
she
had
lost
what
she
had
made
so
sure
of
she
had
only
to
be
resolute
only
to
grasp
firmly
what
was
hers
after
all
these
empty
years
was
she
not
to
have
her
hour
to
sit
still
meekly
and
see
it
snatched
from
her
by
a
slip
of
a
soft
girl
a
thousand
times
no
and
she
watched
her
chance
she
saw
him
about
noon
sally
forth
towards
the
river
with
his
rod
she
had
to
wait
a
little
for
gordy
and
his
bailiff
were
down
there
by
the
tennis
lawn
but
they
soon
moved
on
she
ran
out
then
to
the
park
gate
once
through
that
she
felt
safe
her
husband
she
knew
was
working
in
his
room
the
girl
somewhere
invisible
the
old
governess
still
at
her
housekeeping
doone
writing
letters
she
felt
full
of
hope
and
courage
this
old
wild
tangle
of
a
park
that
she
had
not
yet
seen
was
true
for
fauns
and
nymphs
with
its
mossy
trees
and
boulders
and
the
high
bracken
she
kept
along
under
the
wall
in
the
direction
of
the
river
but
came
to
no
gate
and
began
to
be
afraid
that
she
was
going
wrong
she
could
hear
the
river
on
the
other
side
and
looked
for
some
place
where
she
could
climb
and
see
exactly
where
she
was
an
old
tempted
her
scrambling
up
into
its
fork
she
could
just
see
over
there
was
the
little
river
within
twenty
yards
its
clear
dark
water
running
between
thick
foliage
on
its
bank
lay
a
huge
stone
balanced
on
another
stone
still
more
huge
and
with
his
back
to
this
stone
stood
the
boy
his
rod
leaning
beside
him
and
there
on
the
ground
her
arms
resting
on
her
knees
her
chin
on
her
hands
that
girl
sat
looking
up
how
eager
his
eyes
different
from
the
brooding
eyes
of
yesterday
so
you
see
that
was
all
you
might
forgive
me
sylvia
and
to
anna
it
seemed
verily
as
if
those
two
young
faces
formed
suddenly
but
face
of
youth
if
she
had
stayed
there
looking
for
all
time
she
could
not
have
had
graven
on
her
heart
a
vision
more
indelible
vision
of
spring
of
all
that
was
gone
from
her
for
ever
she
shrank
back
out
of
the
fork
of
the
old
and
like
a
stricken
beast
went
hurrying
stumbling
away
amongst
the
stones
and
bracken
she
ran
thus
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
then
threw
up
her
arms
fell
down
amongst
the
fern
and
lay
there
on
her
face
at
first
her
heart
hurt
her
so
that
she
felt
nothing
but
that
physical
pain
if
she
could
have
died
but
she
knew
it
was
nothing
but
breathlessness
it
left
her
and
that
which
took
its
place
she
tried
to
drive
away
by
pressing
her
breast
against
the
ground
by
clutching
the
stalks
of
the
ache
an
emptiness
too
dreadful
youth
to
youth
he
was
gone
from
she
was
alone
again
she
did
not
cry
what
good
in
crying
but
gusts
of
shame
kept
sweeping
through
her
shame
and
rage
so
this
was
all
she
was
worth
the
sun
struck
hot
on
her
back
in
that
lair
of
tangled
fern
where
she
had
fallen
she
felt
faint
and
sick
she
had
not
known
till
now
quite
what
this
passion
for
the
boy
had
meant
to
her
how
much
of
her
very
belief
in
herself
was
bound
up
with
it
how
much
clinging
to
her
own
youth
what
bitterness
one
soft
slip
of
a
white
young
she
had
become
as
nothing
but
was
that
true
could
she
not
even
now
wrench
him
back
to
her
with
the
passion
that
this
child
knew
nothing
of
surely
oh
surely
let
him
but
once
taste
the
rapture
she
could
give
him
and
at
that
thought
she
ceased
clutching
at
the
bracken
stalks
lying
as
still
as
the
very
stones
around
her
could
she
not
might
she
not
even
now
and
all
feeling
except
just
a
sort
of
quivering
deserted
if
she
had
fallen
into
a
trance
why
spare
this
girl
why
falter
she
was
first
he
had
been
hers
out
there
and
she
still
had
the
power
to
draw
him
at
dinner
the
first
evening
she
had
dragged
his
gaze
to
her
away
from
that
from
youth
as
a
magnet
draws
steel
she
could
still
bind
him
with
chains
that
for
a
little
while
at
all
events
he
would
not
want
to
break
bind
him
hateful
word
take
him
hankering
after
what
she
could
not
give
white
innocence
spring
it
would
be
infamous
infamous
she
sprang
up
from
the
fern
and
ran
along
the
hillside
not
looking
where
she
went
stumbling
among
the
tangled
growth
in
and
out
of
the
boulders
till
she
once
more
sank
breathless
on
to
a
stone
it
was
bare
of
trees
just
here
and
she
could
see
across
the
river
valley
the
high
tor
on
the
far
side
the
sky
was
sun
bright
a
hawk
was
wheeling
over
that
hill
far
up
very
near
the
blue
infamous
she
could
not
do
that
could
not
drug
him
drag
him
to
her
by
his
senses
by
all
that
was
least
high
in
him
when
she
wished
for
him
all
the
finest
things
that
life
could
give
as
if
she
had
been
his
mother
she
could
not
it
would
be
wicked
in
that
moment
of
intense
spiritual
agony
those
two
down
there
in
the
sun
by
the
grey
stone
and
the
dark
water
seemed
guarded
from
her
protected
the
girl
white
trembling
up
the
boy
gaze
leaping
down
strange
that
a
heart
which
felt
that
could
hate
at
the
same
moment
that
and
burn
to
kill
with
kisses
that
eagerness
in
the
boy
eyes
the
storm
in
her
slowly
passed
and
she
prayed
just
to
feel
nothing
it
was
natural
that
she
should
lose
her
hour
natural
that
her
thirst
should
go
unslaked
and
her
passion
never
bloom
natural
that
youth
should
go
to
youth
this
boy
to
his
own
kind
by
the
law
the
breeze
blowing
down
the
valley
fanned
her
cheeks
and
brought
her
a
faint
sensation
of
relief
nobility
was
it
just
a
word
or
did
those
that
gave
up
happiness
feel
noble
she
wandered
for
a
long
time
in
the
park
not
till
late
afternoon
did
she
again
pass
out
by
the
gate
through
which
she
had
entered
full
of
hope
she
met
no
one
before
she
reached
her
room
and
there
to
be
safe
took
refuge
in
her
bed
she
dreaded
only
lest
the
feeling
of
utter
weariness
should
leave
her
she
wanted
no
vigour
of
mind
or
body
till
she
was
away
from
here
she
meant
neither
to
eat
nor
drink
only
to
sleep
if
she
could
if
there
were
any
early
train
she
could
be
gone
before
she
need
see
anyone
her
husband
must
arrange
as
to
what
he
would
think
and
she
could
enough
to
decide
that
and
what
did
it
matter
the
one
vital
thing
now
was
not
to
see
the
boy
for
she
could
not
again
go
through
hours
of
struggle
like
those
she
rang
the
bell
and
sent
the
startled
maid
with
a
message
to
her
husband
and
while
she
waited
for
him
to
come
her
pride
began
revolting
she
must
not
let
him
see
that
would
be
horrible
and
slipping
out
of
bed
she
got
a
handkerchief
and
the
flask
and
bandaged
her
forehead
he
came
almost
instantly
entering
in
his
quick
noiseless
way
and
stood
looking
at
her
he
did
not
ask
what
was
the
matter
but
simply
waited
and
never
before
had
she
realized
so
completely
how
he
began
as
it
were
where
she
left
off
began
on
a
plane
from
which
instinct
and
feeling
were
as
carefully
ruled
out
as
though
they
had
been
blasphemous
she
summoned
all
her
courage
and
said
i
went
into
the
park
the
sun
must
have
been
too
hot
i
should
like
to
go
home
if
you
mind
i
ca
bear
not
feeling
well
in
other
people
she
was
conscious
of
a
smile
flickering
over
his
face
then
it
grew
grave
ah
he
said
yes
the
sun
a
touch
of
that
will
last
some
days
will
you
be
fit
to
travel
though
she
had
a
sudden
conviction
that
he
knew
all
about
it
but
to
know
all
about
it
was
to
feel
himself
had
the
power
of
making
himself
believe
that
he
knew
nothing
was
this
fine
of
him
or
was
it
hateful
she
closed
her
eyes
and
said
my
head
is
bad
but
i
shall
be
able
only
i
do
want
a
fuss
made
could
we
go
by
a
train
before
they
are
down
she
heard
him
say
yes
that
will
have
its
there
was
not
the
faintest
sound
now
but
of
course
he
was
still
there
in
that
dumb
motionless
presence
was
all
her
future
yes
that
would
be
her
thing
without
feeling
and
without
motion
a
fearful
curiosity
came
on
her
to
look
at
it
she
opened
her
gaze
he
was
still
standing
just
as
he
had
been
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
but
one
hand
on
the
edge
of
his
coat
of
the
picture
as
it
nervously
closing
and
unclosing
and
suddenly
she
felt
pity
not
for
her
must
be
like
that
but
for
him
how
dreadful
to
have
grown
so
that
all
emotion
was
dreadful
and
she
said
gently
i
am
sorry
as
if
he
had
heard
something
strange
and
startling
his
eyes
dilated
in
a
curious
way
he
buried
that
nervous
hand
in
his
pocket
turned
and
went
out
xvii
when
young
mark
came
on
sylvia
by
the
it
was
less
surprising
to
him
than
if
he
had
not
known
she
was
watched
her
go
she
was
sitting
all
humped
together
brooding
over
the
water
her
sunbonnet
thrown
back
and
that
hair
in
which
his
star
had
caught
shining
under
the
sun
he
came
on
her
softly
through
the
grass
and
when
he
was
a
little
way
off
thought
it
best
to
halt
if
he
startled
her
she
might
run
away
and
he
would
not
have
the
heart
to
follow
how
still
she
was
lost
in
her
brooding
he
wished
he
could
see
her
face
he
spoke
at
last
gently
sylvia
would
you
mind
and
seeing
that
she
did
not
move
he
went
up
to
her
surely
she
could
not
still
be
angry
with
him
thanks
most
awfully
for
that
book
you
gave
looks
splendid
she
made
no
answer
and
leaning
his
rod
against
the
stone
he
sighed
that
silence
of
hers
seemed
to
him
unjust
what
was
it
she
wanted
him
to
say
or
do
life
was
not
worth
living
if
it
was
to
be
all
bottled
up
like
this
i
never
meant
to
hurt
you
i
hate
hurting
people
it
only
that
my
beasts
are
so
ca
bear
people
to
see
want
to
please
do
really
so
you
see
that
was
all
you
might
forgive
me
sylvia
something
over
the
wall
a
rustling
a
scattering
in
the
no
doubt
and
again
he
said
eagerly
softly
you
might
be
nice
to
me
sylvia
you
really
very
quickly
turning
her
head
away
she
said
it
is
that
any
more
something
what
else
that
i
do
he
knelt
down
beside
her
what
did
she
mean
but
he
knew
well
enough
of
course
you
count
most
awfully
oh
do
be
unhappy
i
hate
people
being
unhappy
do
be
unhappy
sylvia
and
he
began
gently
to
stroke
her
arm
it
was
all
strange
and
troubled
within
him
one
thing
only
must
not
admit
anything
as
if
reading
that
thought
her
blue
eyes
seemed
suddenly
to
search
right
into
him
then
she
pulled
some
blades
of
grass
and
began
plaiting
them
she
ah
he
was
not
going
to
say
she
does
it
would
be
caddish
to
say
that
even
if
she
did
she
still
would
be
mean
and
low
and
in
his
eyes
just
then
there
was
the
look
that
had
made
his
tutor
compare
him
to
a
lion
cub
in
trouble
sylvia
was
touching
his
arm
mark
do
he
got
up
and
took
his
rod
what
was
the
use
he
could
not
stay
there
with
her
since
he
could
not
speak
are
you
going
are
you
angry
please
do
be
angry
with
he
felt
a
choke
in
his
throat
bent
down
to
her
hand
and
kissed
it
then
shouldered
his
rod
and
marched
away
looking
back
once
he
saw
her
still
sitting
there
gazing
after
him
forlorn
by
that
great
stone
it
seemed
to
him
then
there
was
nowhere
he
could
go
nowhere
except
among
the
birds
and
beasts
and
trees
who
did
not
mind
even
if
you
were
all
mixed
up
and
horrible
inside
he
lay
down
in
the
grass
on
the
bank
he
could
see
the
tiny
trout
moving
round
and
round
the
stones
swallows
came
all
about
him
flying
very
low
a
hornet
too
bore
him
company
for
a
little
but
he
could
take
interest
in
nothing
it
was
as
if
his
spirit
were
in
prison
it
would
have
been
nice
indeed
to
be
that
water
never
staying
passing
passing
or
wind
touching
everything
never
caught
to
be
able
to
do
nothing
without
hurting
was
what
was
so
ghastly
if
only
one
were
like
a
flower
that
just
sprang
up
and
lived
its
life
all
to
itself
and
died
but
whatever
he
did
or
said
now
would
be
like
telling
lies
or
else
being
cruel
the
only
thing
was
to
keep
away
from
people
and
yet
how
keep
away
from
his
own
guests
he
went
back
to
the
house
for
lunch
but
both
those
guests
were
out
no
one
seemed
quite
to
know
where
restless
unhappy
puzzled
he
wandered
round
and
about
all
the
afternoon
just
before
dinner
he
was
told
of
stormer
not
being
well
and
that
they
would
be
leaving
three
days
that
plunged
him
deeper
into
his
strange
and
sorrowful
confusion
he
was
reduced
now
to
a
complete
brooding
silence
he
knew
he
was
attracting
attention
but
could
not
help
it
several
times
during
dinner
he
caught
gordy
eyes
fixed
on
him
from
under
those
puffy
lids
with
asphyxiated
speculation
but
he
simply
could
not
that
came
into
his
mind
to
say
seemed
false
ah
it
was
a
sad
its
glimmering
vision
into
another
sore
heart
its
confused
gnawing
sense
of
things
broken
faith
betrayed
and
yet
always
the
perplexed
how
could
i
have
helped
it
and
always
sylvia
wistful
face
that
he
tried
not
to
look
at
he
stole
out
leaving
gordy
and
his
tutor
still
over
their
wine
and
roamed
about
the
garden
a
long
time
listening
sadly
to
the
owls
it
was
a
blessing
to
get
upstairs
though
of
course
he
would
not
sleep
but
he
did
sleep
all
through
a
night
of
many
dreams
in
the
last
of
which
he
was
lying
on
a
mountain
side
anna
looking
down
into
his
eyes
and
bending
her
face
to
his
he
woke
just
as
her
lips
touched
him
still
under
the
spell
of
that
troubling
dream
he
became
conscious
of
the
sound
of
wheels
and
horses
hoofs
on
the
gravel
and
sprang
out
of
bed
there
was
the
waggonette
moving
from
the
door
old
godden
driving
luggage
piled
up
beside
him
and
the
stormers
sitting
opposite
each
other
in
the
carriage
going
away
like
never
even
said
for
a
moment
he
felt
as
people
must
when
they
have
unwittingly
killed
stunned
and
miserable
then
he
dashed
into
his
clothes
he
would
not
let
her
go
thus
he
her
again
what
had
he
done
that
she
should
go
like
this
he
rushed
downstairs
the
hall
was
empty
nineteen
minutes
to
eight
the
train
left
at
eight
had
he
time
to
saddle
bolero
he
rushed
round
to
the
stables
but
the
cob
was
out
being
shoed
he
must
get
there
in
time
it
would
show
her
anyway
that
he
was
not
quite
a
cad
he
walked
till
the
drive
curved
then
began
running
hard
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
already
he
felt
better
not
so
miserable
and
guilty
it
was
something
to
feel
you
had
a
tough
job
in
hand
all
your
work
cut
to
have
to
think
of
economizing
strength
picking
out
the
best
going
keeping
out
of
the
sun
saving
your
wind
uphill
flying
down
any
slope
it
was
cool
still
and
the
dew
had
laid
the
dust
there
was
no
traffic
and
scarcely
anyone
to
look
back
and
gape
as
he
ran
by
what
he
would
do
if
he
got
there
in
explain
this
mad
did
not
think
he
passed
a
farm
that
he
knew
was
just
he
had
left
his
watch
indeed
he
had
put
on
only
his
trousers
shirt
and
norfolk
jacket
no
tie
no
hat
not
even
socks
under
his
tennis
shoes
and
he
was
as
hot
as
fire
with
his
hair
flying
strange
young
creature
indeed
for
anyone
to
meet
but
he
had
lost
now
all
feeling
save
the
will
to
get
there
a
flock
of
sheep
came
out
of
a
field
into
the
lane
he
pushed
through
them
somehow
but
they
lost
him
several
seconds
more
than
a
mile
still
and
he
was
blown
and
his
legs
beginning
to
give
downhill
indeed
they
went
of
their
own
accord
but
there
was
the
long
quite
level
and
he
could
hear
the
train
now
slowly
puffing
its
way
along
the
valley
then
in
spite
of
exhaustion
his
spirit
rose
he
would
not
go
in
looking
like
a
scarecrow
utterly
done
and
make
a
scene
he
must
pull
himself
together
at
the
end
and
stroll
if
he
had
come
for
fun
but
that
at
any
moment
he
felt
he
might
fall
flat
in
the
dust
and
stay
there
for
ever
and
as
he
ran
he
made
little
desperate
efforts
to
mop
his
face
and
brush
his
clothes
there
were
the
gates
at
hundred
yards
away
the
train
he
could
hear
no
longer
it
must
be
standing
in
the
station
and
a
sob
came
from
his
overdriven
lungs
he
heard
the
guard
whistle
as
he
reached
the
gates
instead
of
making
for
the
he
ran
along
the
paling
where
an
entrance
to
the
was
open
and
dashing
through
he
fell
back
against
the
honeysuckle
the
engine
was
just
abreast
of
him
he
snatched
at
his
sleeve
and
passed
it
over
his
face
to
wipe
the
sweat
away
everything
was
blurred
he
must
he
had
not
come
in
time
just
not
to
see
he
pushed
his
hands
over
his
forehead
and
hair
and
spied
up
dizzily
at
the
slowly
passing
train
she
was
there
at
a
window
standing
looking
out
he
dared
not
step
forward
for
fear
of
falling
but
he
put
out
his
saw
him
yes
she
saw
him
she
going
to
make
a
sign
not
one
and
suddenly
he
saw
her
tear
at
her
dress
pluck
something
out
and
throw
it
it
fell
close
to
his
feet
he
did
not
pick
it
wanted
to
see
her
face
till
she
was
gone
it
looked
proud
and
pale
she
put
her
hand
up
to
her
lips
then
everything
went
blurred
again
and
when
he
could
see
once
more
the
train
had
vanished
but
at
his
feet
was
what
she
had
thrown
he
picked
it
up
all
dry
and
dark
it
was
the
flower
she
had
given
him
in
the
tyrol
and
stolen
back
from
his
buttonhole
creeping
out
past
the
he
made
his
way
to
a
field
and
lay
down
with
his
face
pressed
to
that
withered
thing
which
still
had
its
scent
the
asphyxiated
speculation
in
his
guardian
eyes
had
not
been
without
significance
mark
did
not
go
back
to
oxford
he
went
instead
to
live
in
his
sister
house
and
attend
a
school
of
sculpture
that
was
the
beginning
of
a
time
when
nothing
counted
except
his
work
to
anna
he
wrote
twice
but
received
no
answer
from
his
tutor
he
had
one
little
note
my
dear
lennan
so
you
abandon
us
for
art
ah
was
your
moon
if
i
of
them
a
worthy
little
dusty
in
these
little
in
her
to
you
no
doubt
a
virgin
goddess
whose
hem
etc
we
shall
retain
the
friendliest
memories
of
you
in
spite
of
your
defection
once
your
tutor
and
still
your
friend
harold
after
that
vacation
it
was
long
before
he
saw
sylvia
again
part
i
gleam
of
a
thousand
lights
clack
and
mutter
of
innumerable
voices
laughter
footsteps
hiss
and
rumble
of
passing
trains
taking
gamblers
back
to
nice
or
mentone
fevered
wailing
from
the
violins
of
four
fiddlers
with
skins
outside
the
cafe
and
above
around
beyond
the
dark
sky
and
the
dark
mountains
and
the
dark
sea
like
some
great
dark
flower
to
whose
heart
is
clinging
a
jewelled
beetle
so
was
monte
carlo
on
that
may
night
of
but
mark
lennan
at
one
of
the
little
tables
was
in
too
great
maze
and
exaltation
of
spirit
and
of
senses
to
be
conscious
of
its
glare
and
babel
even
of
its
beauty
he
sat
so
very
still
that
his
neighbours
with
the
instinctive
aversion
of
the
human
creature
to
what
is
too
remote
from
its
own
mood
after
one
good
stare
turned
their
eyes
away
as
from
something
ludicrous
almost
offensive
he
was
lost
indeed
in
memory
of
the
minutes
just
gone
by
for
it
had
come
at
last
after
all
these
weeks
of
ferment
after
all
this
strange
time
of
perturbation
very
stealthily
it
had
been
creeping
on
him
ever
since
that
chance
introduction
nearly
a
year
ago
soon
after
he
settled
down
in
london
following
those
six
years
of
rome
and
paris
first
the
merest
friendliness
because
she
was
so
nice
about
his
work
then
respectful
admiration
because
she
was
so
beautiful
then
pity
because
she
was
so
unhappy
in
her
marriage
if
she
had
been
happy
he
would
have
fled
the
knowledge
that
she
had
been
unhappy
long
before
he
knew
her
had
kept
his
conscience
still
and
at
last
one
afternoon
she
said
ah
if
you
come
out
there
too
marvelously
subtle
the
way
that
one
little
outslipped
saying
had
worked
in
him
as
though
it
had
a
life
of
its
a
strange
bird
that
had
flown
into
the
garden
of
his
heart
and
established
itself
with
its
new
song
and
flutterings
its
new
flight
its
wistful
and
ever
clearer
call
that
and
one
moment
a
few
days
later
in
her
london
when
he
had
told
her
that
he
was
coming
and
she
did
not
could
not
he
felt
look
at
him
queer
that
nothing
momentous
said
even
left
altered
all
the
future
and
so
she
had
gone
with
her
uncle
and
aunt
under
whose
wing
one
might
be
sure
she
would
meet
with
no
wayward
or
exotic
happenings
and
he
had
received
from
her
this
little
letter
hotel
coeur
monte
carlo
my
dear
mark
we
arrived
it
is
so
good
to
be
in
the
sun
the
flowers
are
wonderful
i
am
keeping
gorbio
and
roquebrune
till
you
come
your
friend
olive
that
letter
was
the
single
clear
memory
he
had
of
the
time
between
her
going
and
his
following
he
received
it
one
afternoon
sitting
on
an
old
low
garden
wall
with
the
spring
sun
shining
on
him
through
in
blossom
and
a
feeling
as
if
all
the
desire
of
the
world
lay
before
him
and
he
had
but
to
stretch
out
his
arms
to
take
it
then
confused
unrest
all
things
vague
till
at
the
end
of
his
journey
he
stepped
out
of
the
train
at
beaulieu
with
a
furiously
beating
heart
but
why
surely
he
had
not
expected
her
to
come
out
from
monte
carlo
to
meet
him
a
week
had
gone
by
since
then
in
one
long
effort
to
be
with
her
and
appear
to
others
as
though
he
did
not
greatly
wish
to
be
two
concerts
two
walks
with
her
alone
when
all
that
he
had
said
seemed
as
nothing
said
and
all
her
sayings
but
ghosts
of
what
he
wished
to
hear
a
week
of
confusion
day
and
night
until
a
few
minutes
ago
her
handkerchief
had
fallen
from
her
glove
on
to
the
dusty
road
and
he
had
picked
it
up
and
put
it
to
his
lips
nothing
could
take
away
the
look
she
had
given
him
then
nothing
could
ever
again
separate
her
from
him
utterly
she
had
confessed
in
it
to
the
same
sweet
fearful
trouble
that
he
himself
was
feeling
she
had
not
spoken
but
he
had
seen
her
lips
part
her
breast
rise
and
fall
and
he
had
not
spoken
what
was
the
use
of
words
he
felt
in
the
pocket
of
his
coat
there
against
his
fingers
was
that
wisp
of
lawn
and
lace
soft
yet
somehow
alive
and
stealthily
he
took
it
out
the
whole
of
her
with
her
fragrance
seemed
pressed
to
his
face
in
the
touch
of
that
lawn
border
roughened
by
little
white
stars
more
secretly
than
ever
he
put
it
back
and
for
the
first
time
looked
round
these
people
they
belonged
to
a
world
that
he
had
left
they
gave
him
the
same
feeling
that
her
uncle
and
aunt
had
given
him
just
now
when
they
said
following
her
into
their
hotel
that
good
colonel
that
good
ercott
the
very
concretion
of
the
world
he
had
been
brought
up
in
of
the
english
point
of
view
symbolic
figures
of
health
reason
and
the
straight
path
on
which
at
that
moment
seemingly
he
had
turned
his
back
the
colonel
profile
ruddy
through
its
tan
with
grey
moustache
guiltless
of
any
wax
his
cheery
young
lennan
his
wife
curly
smile
her
flat
cosy
confidential
strange
and
remote
they
had
suddenly
become
and
all
these
people
here
chattering
queer
and
far
away
or
was
it
just
that
he
was
queer
and
remote
to
them
and
getting
up
from
his
table
he
passed
the
fiddlers
with
the
skins
out
into
the
place
ii
he
went
up
the
side
streets
to
the
back
of
her
hotel
and
stood
by
the
railings
of
the
of
those
hotel
gardens
which
exist
but
to
figure
in
advertisements
with
its
few
arid
palms
its
paths
staring
white
between
them
and
a
fringe
of
dusty
lilacs
and
mimosas
and
there
came
to
him
the
oddest
he
had
been
there
before
peering
through
blossoms
at
those
staring
paths
and
shuttered
windows
a
scent
of
was
abroad
and
some
dry
plant
rustled
ever
so
faintly
in
what
little
wind
was
stirring
what
was
there
of
memory
in
this
night
this
garden
some
dark
sweet
thing
invisible
to
feel
whose
presence
was
at
once
ecstasy
and
the
irritation
of
a
thirst
that
will
not
be
quenched
and
he
walked
on
houses
houses
at
last
he
was
away
from
them
alone
on
the
high
road
beyond
the
limits
of
monaco
and
walking
thus
through
the
night
he
had
thoughts
that
he
imagined
no
one
had
ever
had
before
him
the
knowledge
that
she
loved
him
had
made
everything
seem
very
sacred
and
responsible
whatever
he
did
he
must
not
harm
her
women
were
so
helpless
for
in
spite
of
six
years
of
art
in
rome
and
paris
he
still
had
a
fastidious
reverence
for
women
if
she
had
loved
her
husband
she
would
have
been
safe
enough
from
him
but
to
be
bound
to
a
companionship
that
she
gave
had
seemed
to
him
atrocious
even
before
he
loved
her
how
could
any
husband
ask
that
have
so
little
little
pity
the
unpardonable
thing
what
was
there
to
respect
in
such
a
marriage
only
he
must
not
do
her
harm
but
now
that
her
eyes
had
said
i
love
you
then
it
was
simply
miraculous
to
know
that
under
the
stars
of
this
warm
southern
night
burning
its
incense
of
trees
and
flowers
climbing
up
above
the
road
he
lay
down
if
only
she
were
there
beside
him
the
fragrance
of
the
earth
not
yet
chilled
crept
to
his
face
and
for
just
a
moment
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
did
come
if
he
could
keep
her
there
for
ever
in
that
embrace
that
was
no
that
ghostly
rapture
on
this
wild
fragrant
bed
that
no
lovers
before
had
ever
pressed
save
the
creeping
things
and
the
flowers
save
sunlight
and
moonlight
with
their
shadows
and
the
wind
kissing
the
earth
then
she
was
gone
his
hands
touched
nothing
but
the
crumbled
pine
dust
and
the
flowers
of
the
wild
thyme
fallen
into
sleep
he
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
little
cliff
above
the
road
between
the
dark
mountains
and
the
sea
black
with
depth
too
late
for
any
as
far
from
what
men
thought
and
said
and
did
as
the
very
night
itself
with
its
whispering
warmth
and
he
conjured
up
her
face
making
certain
of
eyes
clear
and
brown
and
wide
apart
the
close
sweet
mouth
the
dark
hair
the
whole
flying
loveliness
then
he
leaped
down
into
the
road
and
could
not
walk
feeling
this
miracle
that
no
one
had
ever
felt
before
the
miracle
of
love
iii
in
their
most
reputable
hotel
coeur
long
since
remodelled
and
renamed
ercott
lay
in
her
bed
looking
by
starlight
at
the
colonel
in
his
bed
her
ears
were
carefully
freed
from
the
pressure
of
her
pillow
for
she
thought
she
heard
a
mosquito
companion
for
thirty
years
to
one
whose
life
had
been
feverishly
punctuated
by
the
attentions
of
those
little
beasts
she
had
no
love
for
them
it
was
the
one
subject
on
which
perhaps
her
imagination
was
stronger
than
her
common
sense
for
in
fact
there
was
not
and
could
not
be
a
mosquito
since
the
first
thing
the
colonel
did
on
arriving
at
any
place
farther
south
than
parallel
of
latitude
was
to
open
the
windows
very
wide
and
nail
with
many
tiny
tacks
a
piece
of
mosquito
netting
across
that
refreshing
space
while
she
held
him
firmly
by
the
the
fact
that
other
people
did
not
so
secure
their
windows
did
not
at
all
trouble
the
colonel
a
true
englishman
who
loved
to
act
in
his
own
way
and
to
think
in
the
ways
of
other
people
after
that
they
would
wait
till
night
came
then
burn
a
peculiar
little
lamp
with
a
peculiar
little
smell
and
in
the
full
glare
of
the
gaslight
stand
about
on
chairs
with
slippers
and
their
eyes
fixed
on
true
or
imaginary
beasts
then
would
fall
little
slaps
making
little
messes
and
little
joyous
or
doleful
cries
would
arise
i
got
that
one
oh
john
i
missed
him
and
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
colonel
in
pyjamas
and
spectacles
only
worn
in
very
solemn
moments
low
down
on
his
nose
would
revolve
slowly
turning
his
eyes
with
that
look
in
them
of
death
which
he
had
so
long
acquired
on
every
inch
of
wall
and
ceiling
till
at
last
he
would
say
well
dolly
that
the
lot
at
which
she
would
say
give
me
a
kiss
dear
and
he
would
kiss
her
and
get
into
his
bed
there
was
then
no
mosquito
save
that
general
ghost
of
him
which
lingered
in
the
mind
of
one
devoted
to
her
husband
spying
out
his
profile
for
he
was
lying
on
his
back
she
refrained
from
saying
john
are
you
awake
a
whiffling
sound
was
coming
from
a
nose
to
to
military
duties
had
given
a
slight
crook
half
an
inch
below
the
level
of
grizzled
eyebrows
raised
a
little
as
though
surprised
at
the
sounds
beneath
she
could
hardly
see
him
but
she
thought
how
good
he
looks
and
in
fact
he
did
it
was
the
face
of
a
man
incapable
of
evil
having
in
its
sleep
the
candour
of
one
at
heart
a
simple
candour
of
those
who
have
never
known
how
to
seek
adventures
of
the
mind
and
have
always
sought
adventures
of
the
body
then
somehow
she
did
say
john
are
you
asleep
the
colonel
instantly
alive
as
at
some
attack
answered
that
poor
young
man
which
mark
lennan
have
you
seen
what
my
dear
it
was
under
your
nose
but
you
never
do
see
these
things
the
colonel
slowly
turned
his
head
his
wife
was
an
imaginative
woman
she
had
always
been
so
dimly
he
perceived
that
something
romantic
was
about
to
come
from
her
but
with
that
almost
professional
gentleness
of
a
man
who
has
cut
the
heads
and
arms
off
people
in
his
time
he
answered
what
things
he
picked
up
her
whose
olive
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
i
distinctly
saw
there
was
silence
then
ercott
voice
rose
again
impersonal
far
away
what
always
astonishes
me
about
young
people
is
the
way
they
think
they
not
dears
still
there
was
silence
john
are
you
thinking
for
a
considerable
sound
of
breathing
not
mere
whiffling
now
was
coming
from
the
his
wife
a
sure
sign
and
indeed
he
was
thinking
dolly
was
an
imaginative
woman
but
something
told
him
that
in
this
case
she
might
not
be
riding
past
the
hounds
ercott
raised
herself
he
looked
more
good
than
ever
a
little
perplexed
frown
had
climbed
up
with
his
eyebrows
and
got
caught
in
the
wrinkles
across
his
forehead
i
very
fond
of
olive
he
said
ercott
fell
back
on
her
pillows
in
her
heart
there
was
just
that
little
soreness
natural
to
a
woman
over
fifty
whose
husband
has
a
niece
no
doubt
she
murmured
something
vague
moved
deep
down
in
the
colonel
he
stretched
out
his
hand
in
that
strip
of
gloom
between
the
beds
it
encountered
another
hand
which
squeezed
it
rather
hard
he
said
look
here
old
girl
and
there
was
silence
ercott
in
her
turn
was
thinking
her
thoughts
were
flat
and
rapid
like
her
voice
but
had
that
sort
of
sentiment
which
accompanies
the
mental
exercise
of
women
with
good
hearts
poor
young
man
and
poor
olive
but
was
a
woman
ever
to
be
pitied
when
she
was
so
pretty
as
that
besides
when
all
was
said
and
done
she
had
a
man
for
husband
in
parliament
with
a
career
and
fond
of
and
their
little
house
in
london
so
close
to
westminster
was
a
distinct
dear
and
nothing
could
be
more
charming
than
their
cottage
by
the
river
was
olive
then
to
be
pitied
and
was
not
happy
it
was
no
good
pretending
that
she
was
happy
all
very
well
to
say
that
such
things
were
within
one
control
but
if
you
read
novels
at
all
you
knew
they
were
there
was
such
a
thing
as
incompatibility
oh
yes
and
there
was
the
matter
of
difference
in
their
ages
olive
was
robert
cramier
and
now
this
young
mark
lennan
was
in
love
with
her
what
if
she
were
in
love
with
him
john
would
realize
then
perhaps
that
the
young
flew
to
the
young
for
the
best
like
john
were
funny
she
would
never
dream
of
feeling
for
any
of
her
nephews
as
john
clearly
felt
for
olive
the
colonel
voice
broke
in
on
her
thoughts
nice
young
great
pity
better
sheer
and
rather
suddenly
she
answered
suppose
he
ca
ca
did
you
never
hear
of
a
passion
the
colonel
rose
on
his
elbow
this
was
another
of
those
occasions
that
showed
him
how
during
the
later
years
of
his
service
in
madras
and
upper
burmah
when
dolly
health
had
not
been
equal
to
the
heat
she
had
picked
up
in
london
a
queer
way
of
looking
at
if
they
were
so
right
or
wrong
he
felt
them
to
be
and
he
repeated
those
two
french
words
in
his
own
way
adding
is
that
just
what
i
saying
the
sooner
he
stands
clear
the
but
ercott
too
sat
up
be
human
she
said
the
colonel
experienced
the
same
sensation
as
when
one
suddenly
knows
that
one
is
not
digesting
food
because
young
lennan
was
in
danger
of
getting
into
a
dishonourable
fix
he
was
told
to
be
human
really
dolly
the
white
blur
of
her
new
boudoir
cap
suddenly
impinged
on
his
consciousness
surely
she
was
not
at
her
time
of
life
i
thinking
of
olive
he
said
i
do
want
her
worried
with
that
sort
of
perhaps
olive
can
manage
for
herself
in
these
days
it
does
do
to
interfere
with
love
muttered
the
colonel
what
phew
if
one
own
wife
called
sort
why
had
he
been
faithful
to
very
hot
these
years
a
sense
of
waste
and
of
injustice
tried
to
rear
its
head
against
all
the
side
of
him
that
attached
certain
meanings
to
certain
words
and
acted
up
to
them
and
this
revolt
gave
him
a
feeling
strange
and
so
unpleasant
love
it
was
not
a
word
to
use
thus
loosely
love
led
to
marriage
this
could
not
lead
to
marriage
except
divorce
court
and
suddenly
the
colonel
had
a
vision
of
his
dead
brother
lindsay
olive
father
standing
there
in
the
dark
with
his
grave
face
under
the
black
hair
supposed
to
be
derived
from
a
french
ancestress
who
had
escaped
from
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
upright
fellow
always
before
he
was
made
bishop
queer
somehow
that
olive
should
be
his
daughter
not
that
she
was
not
upright
not
at
all
but
she
was
soft
lindsay
was
not
imagine
him
seeing
that
young
fellow
putting
her
handkerchief
in
his
pocket
but
had
young
lennan
really
done
such
a
thing
dolly
was
imaginative
he
had
mistaken
it
probably
for
his
own
if
he
had
chanced
to
blow
his
nose
he
would
have
realized
for
coupled
with
the
almost
candour
of
his
mind
the
colonel
had
real
administrative
vigour
a
true
sense
of
practical
values
an
ounce
of
illustration
was
always
worth
to
him
a
pound
of
theory
dolly
was
given
to
riding
off
on
theories
thank
god
she
never
acted
on
he
said
gently
my
dear
young
lennan
may
be
an
artist
and
all
that
but
he
a
gentleman
i
know
old
heatherley
his
guardian
why
i
introduced
him
to
olive
myself
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
he
in
love
with
one
of
the
countless
legion
that
hold
a
creed
taken
at
face
value
into
whose
roots
and
reasons
they
have
never
dreamed
of
going
the
colonel
was
staggered
like
some
native
on
an
island
surrounded
by
troubled
seas
which
he
has
stared
at
with
a
certain
contemptuous
awe
all
his
life
but
never
entered
he
was
disconcerted
by
thus
being
asked
to
leave
the
shore
and
by
his
own
wife
indeed
ercott
had
not
intended
to
go
so
far
but
there
was
in
her
as
in
all
women
whose
minds
are
more
active
than
their
husbands
a
something
worrying
her
always
to
go
a
little
farther
than
she
meant
with
real
compunction
she
heard
the
colonel
say
i
must
get
up
and
drink
some
she
was
out
of
bed
in
a
moment
not
without
boiling
she
had
seriously
troubled
him
then
now
he
would
not
blood
went
to
his
head
so
quickly
he
would
just
lie
awake
trying
not
to
disturb
her
she
could
not
bear
him
not
to
disturb
her
it
seemed
so
selfish
of
her
she
ought
to
have
known
that
the
whole
subject
was
too
dangerous
to
discuss
at
night
she
became
conscious
that
he
was
standing
just
behind
her
his
figure
in
its
thin
covering
looked
very
lean
his
face
strangely
worn
i
sorry
you
put
that
idea
into
my
head
he
said
i
fond
of
again
ercott
felt
that
jealous
twinge
soon
lost
this
time
in
the
motherliness
of
a
childless
woman
for
her
husband
he
must
not
be
troubled
he
should
not
be
troubled
and
she
said
the
water
boiling
now
sip
a
good
glass
slowly
and
get
into
bed
or
i
take
your
temperature
obediently
the
colonel
took
from
her
the
glass
and
as
he
sipped
she
put
her
hand
up
and
stroked
his
head
iv
in
the
room
below
them
the
subject
of
their
discussion
was
lying
very
wide
awake
she
knew
that
she
had
betrayed
herself
made
plain
to
mark
lennan
what
she
had
never
until
now
admitted
to
herself
but
the
which
for
the
life
of
her
she
could
not
keep
back
had
been
followed
by
a
feeling
of
having
caste
for
hitherto
the
world
of
women
had
been
strictly
divided
by
her
into
those
who
did
and
those
who
did
not
do
such
things
and
to
be
no
longer
quite
sure
to
which
half
she
belonged
was
frightening
but
what
was
the
good
of
thinking
of
being
frightened
could
not
lead
to
anything
yesterday
she
had
not
known
this
would
come
and
now
she
could
not
guess
at
was
enough
with
its
swimming
loveliness
just
to
feel
to
love
and
to
be
loved
a
new
sensation
for
different
from
those
excited
by
the
courtships
of
her
girlhood
or
by
her
marriage
as
light
from
darkness
for
she
had
never
been
in
love
not
even
with
her
husband
she
knew
it
now
the
sun
was
shining
in
a
world
where
she
had
thought
there
was
none
nothing
could
come
of
it
but
the
sun
was
shining
and
in
that
sunshine
she
must
warm
herself
a
little
quite
simply
she
began
to
plan
what
he
and
she
would
do
there
were
six
days
left
they
had
not
yet
been
to
gorbio
nor
to
of
those
long
walks
or
rides
they
had
designed
to
do
for
the
beauty
of
them
would
he
come
early
what
could
they
do
together
no
one
should
know
what
these
six
days
would
be
to
even
he
to
be
with
him
watch
his
face
hear
his
voice
and
now
and
then
just
touch
him
she
could
trust
herself
to
show
no
one
and
then
it
would
though
of
course
she
would
see
him
again
in
london
and
lying
there
in
the
dark
she
thought
of
their
first
meeting
one
sunday
morning
in
hyde
park
the
colonel
religiously
observed
church
parade
and
would
even
come
all
the
way
down
to
westminster
from
his
flat
near
knightsbridge
in
order
to
fetch
his
niece
up
to
it
she
remembered
how
during
their
stroll
he
had
stopped
suddenly
in
front
of
an
old
gentleman
with
a
puffy
yellow
face
and
eyes
half
open
ah
up
from
devonshire
how
your
and
the
old
gentleman
glaring
a
little
as
it
seemed
to
her
from
under
his
eyelids
and
his
grey
top
hat
had
answered
colonel
ercott
i
think
here
the
fellow
and
a
young
man
had
taken
off
his
hat
she
had
only
noticed
at
first
that
his
dark
hair
very
thick
and
that
his
eyes
were
very
then
she
saw
him
smile
it
made
his
face
all
eager
yet
left
it
shy
and
she
decided
that
he
was
nice
soon
after
she
had
gone
with
the
ercotts
to
see
his
for
it
was
of
course
and
especially
in
those
days
quite
an
event
to
know
a
like
having
a
zebra
in
your
park
the
colonel
had
been
delighted
and
a
little
relieved
to
find
that
the
were
nearly
all
of
beasts
and
birds
very
interestin
to
one
full
of
curious
lore
about
such
having
in
his
time
killed
many
of
them
and
finding
himself
at
the
end
of
it
with
a
curious
aversion
to
killing
any
he
never
put
into
words
acquaintanceship
had
ripened
fast
after
that
first
visit
to
his
studio
and
now
it
was
her
turn
to
be
relieved
that
mark
lennan
devoted
himself
almost
entirely
to
beasts
and
birds
instead
of
to
the
human
form
divine
ah
would
have
suffered
now
that
she
loved
him
she
saw
that
at
all
events
she
could
watch
his
work
and
help
it
with
sympathy
that
could
not
be
wrong
she
fell
asleep
at
last
and
dreamed
that
she
was
in
a
boat
alone
on
the
river
near
her
country
cottage
drifting
along
among
spiky
flowers
like
asphodels
with
birds
singing
and
flying
round
her
she
could
move
neither
face
nor
limbs
but
that
helpless
feeling
was
not
unpleasant
till
she
became
conscious
that
she
was
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
to
what
was
neither
water
nor
land
light
nor
darkness
but
simply
some
unutterable
feeling
and
then
she
saw
gazing
at
her
out
of
the
rushes
on
the
banks
a
great
bull
head
it
moved
as
she
was
on
both
sides
of
her
yet
all
the
time
only
one
head
she
tried
to
raise
her
hands
and
cover
her
eyes
but
could
woke
with
a
sob
it
was
light
nearly
six
already
her
dream
made
her
disinclined
to
trust
again
to
sleep
sleep
was
a
robber
each
minute
of
these
few
days
she
got
up
and
looked
out
the
morning
was
fine
the
air
warm
already
sweet
with
dew
and
heliotrope
nailed
to
the
wall
outside
her
window
she
had
but
to
open
her
shutters
and
walk
into
the
sun
she
dressed
took
her
sunshade
stealthily
slipped
the
shutters
back
and
stole
forth
shunning
the
hotel
garden
where
the
eccentricity
of
her
early
wandering
might
betray
the
condition
of
her
spirit
she
passed
through
into
the
road
toward
the
casino
without
perhaps
knowing
it
she
was
making
for
where
she
had
sat
with
him
yesterday
afternoon
listening
to
the
band
hatless
but
defended
by
her
sunshade
she
excited
the
admiration
of
the
few
connoisseurs
as
yet
abroad
strolling
in
blue
blouses
to
their
labours
and
this
simple
admiration
gave
her
pleasure
for
once
she
was
really
conscious
of
the
grace
in
her
own
limbs
actually
felt
the
gentle
vividness
of
her
own
face
with
its
nearly
black
hair
and
eyes
and
creamy
sensation
and
very
comforting
in
the
casino
gardens
she
walked
more
slowly
savouring
the
aromatic
trees
and
stopping
to
bend
and
look
at
almost
every
flower
then
on
the
seat
where
she
had
sat
with
him
yesterday
she
rested
a
few
paces
away
were
the
steps
that
led
to
the
trodden
upwards
eagerly
by
so
many
day
after
day
night
after
night
and
lightly
or
sorrowfully
descended
above
her
two
pines
a
and
a
palm
mingled
their
fantastic
the
jumbling
of
trees
and
souls
in
this
strange
place
she
furled
her
sunshade
and
leaned
back
her
gaze
free
and
friendly
passed
from
bough
to
bough
against
the
bright
sky
unbesieged
as
yet
by
heat
or
dust
they
had
a
spiritual
look
lying
sharp
and
flat
along
the
air
she
plucked
a
cluster
of
pinkish
berries
from
the
crushing
and
rubbing
them
between
her
hands
to
get
their
fragrance
all
these
beautiful
and
sweet
things
seemed
to
be
a
part
of
her
joy
at
being
loved
part
of
this
sudden
summer
in
her
heart
the
sky
the
flowers
that
jewel
of
sea
the
bright
acacias
were
nothing
in
the
world
but
love
and
those
few
who
passed
and
saw
her
sitting
there
under
the
wondered
no
doubt
at
the
stillness
of
this
dame
bien
mise
who
had
risen
so
early
v
in
the
small
hours
which
so
many
wish
were
smaller
the
colonel
had
awakened
with
the
affair
of
the
handkerchief
swelling
visibly
his
niece
husband
was
not
a
man
that
he
had
much
liking
taciturn
fellow
with
possibly
a
bit
of
the
brute
in
him
a
man
who
rather
rode
people
down
but
since
dolly
and
he
were
in
charge
of
olive
the
notion
that
young
lennan
was
falling
in
love
with
her
under
their
very
noses
was
alarming
to
one
naturally
punctilious
it
was
not
until
he
fell
asleep
again
and
woke
in
full
morning
light
that
the
remedy
occurred
to
him
she
must
be
taken
out
of
herself
dolly
and
he
had
been
slack
too
interested
in
this
queer
place
this
queer
lot
of
people
they
had
neglected
her
left
her
to
boys
and
girls
ought
always
to
remember
but
it
was
not
too
late
she
was
old
lindsay
daughter
would
not
forget
herself
poor
old
fellow
bit
too
much
perhaps
of
in
him
queer
those
had
noticed
in
horses
time
and
hairs
about
the
tail
carriage
of
the
generations
and
then
pop
out
and
olive
had
something
of
his
same
ivory
skin
same
colour
of
eyes
and
hair
only
she
was
not
severe
like
her
father
not
exactly
and
once
more
there
shot
through
the
colonel
a
vague
dread
as
of
a
trusteeship
neglected
it
disappeared
however
in
his
bath
he
was
out
before
eight
a
thin
upright
figure
in
hard
straw
hat
and
grey
flannel
clothes
walking
with
the
indescribable
loose
poise
of
the
soldier
englishman
with
that
air
different
from
the
french
german
what
not
because
of
shoulders
ever
asserting
through
their
drill
the
right
to
put
on
mufti
with
that
perfectly
quiet
and
modest
air
of
knowing
that
whatever
might
be
said
there
was
only
one
way
of
wearing
clothes
and
moving
legs
and
as
he
walked
he
smoothed
his
drooping
grey
moustache
considering
how
best
to
take
his
niece
out
of
herself
he
passed
along
by
the
terrace
and
stood
for
a
moment
looking
down
at
the
sea
beyond
the
ground
then
he
moved
on
round
under
the
casino
into
the
gardens
at
the
back
a
beautiful
spot
wonderful
care
they
had
taken
with
the
plants
it
made
him
think
a
little
of
tushawore
where
his
old
friend
the
old
rascal
gardens
to
his
palace
rather
like
these
he
paced
again
to
the
front
it
was
nice
and
quiet
in
the
early
mornings
with
the
sea
down
there
and
nobody
trying
to
get
the
better
of
anybody
else
there
were
fellows
never
happy
unless
they
were
doing
someone
in
the
eye
he
had
known
men
who
would
ride
at
the
devil
himself
make
it
a
point
of
honour
to
swindle
a
friend
out
of
a
few
pounds
odd
place
this
of
a
garden
of
eden
gone
wrong
and
all
the
real
but
quite
inarticulate
love
of
nature
which
had
supported
the
colonel
through
deserts
and
jungles
on
transports
at
sea
and
in
mountain
camps
awoke
in
the
sweetness
of
these
gardens
his
dear
mother
he
had
never
forgotten
the
words
with
which
she
had
shown
him
the
sunset
through
the
coppice
down
at
old
withes
norton
when
he
was
nine
years
old
that
is
beauty
jack
do
you
feel
it
darling
he
had
not
felt
it
at
the
he
a
scampering
youngster
even
when
he
first
went
to
india
he
had
had
no
eye
for
a
sunset
the
rising
generation
were
different
that
young
couple
for
instance
under
the
sitting
there
without
a
word
just
looking
at
the
trees
how
long
he
wondered
had
they
been
sitting
like
that
and
suddenly
something
in
the
colonel
leaped
his
eyes
took
on
their
look
of
death
choking
down
a
cough
he
faced
about
back
to
where
he
had
stood
above
the
ground
olive
and
that
young
fellow
an
assignation
at
this
time
in
the
morning
the
earth
reeled
his
brother
favourite
niece
the
woman
whom
he
most
woman
for
whom
his
heart
was
softest
leaning
over
the
stone
parapet
no
longer
seeing
either
the
smooth
green
of
the
ground
or
the
smooth
blue
of
the
sea
beyond
he
was
moved
distressed
bewildered
beyond
words
before
breakfast
that
was
the
devil
of
it
confession
as
it
were
of
everything
moreover
he
had
seen
their
hands
touching
on
the
seat
the
blood
rushed
up
to
his
face
he
had
seen
spied
out
what
was
not
intended
for
his
eyes
nice
dolly
too
last
night
had
seen
but
that
was
different
women
might
see
was
expected
of
them
but
for
a
gentleman
the
fullness
of
his
embarrassment
gradually
disclosed
itself
his
hands
were
tied
could
he
even
consult
dolly
he
had
a
feeling
of
isolation
of
utter
solitude
anybody
in
the
understand
his
secret
and
intense
discomfort
to
take
up
a
position
he
was
bound
to
take
up
as
olive
nearest
relative
and
protector
was
by
the
aid
of
knowledge
come
at
in
such
a
way
however
unintentionally
never
in
all
his
days
in
the
many
delicate
matters
affecting
honour
had
come
his
he
had
a
thing
like
this
to
deal
with
poor
child
but
he
had
no
business
to
think
of
her
like
that
no
indeed
she
had
not
there
he
paused
curiously
unable
to
condemn
her
suppose
they
got
up
and
came
that
way
he
took
his
hands
off
the
stone
parapet
and
made
for
his
hotel
his
palms
were
white
from
the
force
of
his
grip
he
said
to
himself
as
he
went
along
i
must
consider
the
whole
question
calmly
i
must
think
it
this
gave
him
relief
with
young
lennan
at
all
events
he
could
be
angry
but
even
there
he
found
to
his
dismay
no
finality
of
judgment
and
this
absence
of
finality
so
unwonted
distressed
him
horribly
there
was
something
in
the
way
the
young
man
had
been
sitting
there
beside
quiet
so
almost
had
touched
him
this
was
bad
by
bad
the
two
of
them
they
made
somehow
a
nice
couple
confound
it
this
would
not
do
the
chaplain
of
the
little
english
church
passing
at
this
moment
called
out
fine
morning
colonel
the
colonel
saluted
and
did
not
answer
the
greeting
at
the
moment
seemed
to
him
paltry
no
morning
could
be
fine
that
contained
such
a
discovery
he
entered
the
hotel
passed
into
the
and
sat
down
nobody
was
there
they
all
had
their
breakfast
upstairs
even
dolly
olive
alone
was
in
the
habit
of
supporting
him
while
he
ate
an
english
breakfast
and
suddenly
he
perceived
that
he
was
face
to
face
already
with
this
dreadful
situation
to
have
breakfast
without
as
usual
waiting
for
her
seemed
too
pointed
she
might
be
coming
in
at
any
minute
now
to
wait
for
her
and
have
it
without
showing
could
he
do
that
he
was
conscious
of
a
faint
rustling
behind
him
there
she
was
and
nothing
decided
in
this
moment
of
hopeless
confusion
the
colonel
acted
by
pure
instinct
rose
patted
her
cheek
and
placed
a
chair
well
my
dear
he
said
hungry
she
was
looking
very
dainty
very
soft
that
creamy
dress
showed
off
her
dark
hair
and
eyes
which
seemed
somehow
to
off
somewhere
was
queer
but
that
was
the
only
way
to
put
it
he
got
no
reassurance
no
comfort
from
the
sight
of
her
and
slowly
he
stripped
the
skin
from
the
banana
with
which
he
always
commenced
breakfast
one
might
just
as
well
be
asked
to
shoot
a
tame
dove
or
tear
a
pretty
flower
to
pieces
as
be
expected
to
take
her
to
task
even
if
he
could
in
honour
and
he
sought
refuge
in
the
words
been
out
then
could
have
bitten
his
tongue
off
suppose
she
answered
but
she
did
not
so
answer
the
colour
came
into
her
cheeks
indeed
but
she
nodded
it
so
lovely
how
pretty
she
looked
saying
that
he
had
put
himself
out
of
court
never
tell
her
what
he
had
seen
after
setting
as
it
were
that
trap
for
her
and
presently
he
asked
got
any
plans
she
answered
without
flinching
in
the
least
mark
lennan
and
i
were
going
to
take
mules
from
mentone
up
to
he
was
amazed
at
her
to
his
knowledge
having
encountered
a
woman
armoured
at
every
point
to
preserve
a
love
that
flies
against
the
world
how
tell
what
was
under
her
smile
and
in
confusion
of
feeling
that
amounted
almost
to
pain
he
heard
her
say
will
you
and
aunt
dolly
come
between
sense
of
trusteeship
and
hatred
of
spoiling
sport
between
knowledge
of
the
danger
she
was
in
and
admiration
at
the
sight
of
her
between
real
disapproval
of
an
illicit
and
underhand
business
what
else
was
it
after
all
and
some
dim
perception
that
here
was
something
he
did
not
begin
to
be
able
to
that
perhaps
no
one
but
those
two
themselves
could
deal
these
various
extremes
he
was
lost
indeed
and
he
stammered
out
i
must
ask
your
aunt
not
very
good
on
a
then
in
an
impulse
of
sheer
affection
he
said
with
startling
suddenness
my
dear
i
often
meant
to
ask
are
you
happy
at
home
at
home
there
was
something
sinister
about
the
way
she
repeated
that
as
if
the
word
home
were
strange
to
her
she
drank
her
coffee
and
got
up
and
the
colonel
felt
afraid
of
her
standing
of
what
she
was
going
to
tell
him
he
grew
very
red
but
worse
than
all
she
said
absolutely
nothing
only
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
a
little
smile
that
went
to
his
heart
vi
on
the
wild
thyme
under
the
olives
below
the
rock
village
of
gorbio
with
their
mules
cropping
at
a
little
distance
those
two
sat
after
their
lunch
listening
to
the
cuckoos
since
their
uncanny
chance
meeting
that
morning
in
the
gardens
when
they
sat
with
their
hands
just
touching
amazed
and
elated
by
their
own
good
fortune
there
was
not
much
need
to
say
what
they
felt
to
break
with
words
this
rapture
of
belonging
to
each
shyly
so
wildly
so
as
it
were
without
reality
they
were
like
epicures
with
old
wine
in
their
glasses
not
yet
tired
of
its
fragrance
and
the
spell
of
anticipation
and
so
their
talk
was
not
of
love
but
in
that
pathetic
way
of
lovers
of
the
things
they
loved
leaving
other
it
was
the
telling
of
her
dream
that
brought
the
words
from
him
at
last
but
she
drew
away
and
answered
it
must
be
then
he
just
clung
to
her
hand
and
presently
seeing
that
her
eyes
were
wet
took
courage
enough
to
kiss
her
cheek
trembling
and
fugitive
indeed
that
first
passage
of
their
love
not
much
of
the
conquering
male
in
him
nor
in
her
of
the
ordinary
enchantress
and
then
they
went
outwardly
sober
enough
riding
their
mules
down
the
stony
slopes
back
to
mentone
but
in
the
grey
dusty
when
she
had
left
him
he
was
like
a
man
drugged
staring
at
where
she
had
sat
opposite
two
hours
later
at
dinner
in
her
hotel
between
her
and
ercott
with
the
colonel
opposite
he
knew
for
the
first
time
what
he
was
faced
with
to
watch
every
thought
that
passed
within
him
lest
it
should
by
the
slightest
sign
betray
him
to
regulate
and
veil
every
look
and
every
word
he
spoke
to
her
never
for
a
second
to
forget
that
these
other
persons
were
actual
and
dangerous
not
merely
the
insignificant
and
grotesque
shadows
that
they
seemed
it
would
be
perhaps
for
ever
a
part
of
his
love
for
her
to
seem
not
to
love
her
he
did
not
dare
dream
of
fulfilment
he
was
to
be
her
friend
and
try
to
bring
her
and
long
for
her
and
not
think
about
reward
this
was
his
first
real
overwhelming
different
to
the
loves
of
he
brought
to
it
all
that
naivete
that
touching
quality
of
young
englishmen
whose
secret
instinct
it
is
to
back
away
from
the
full
nature
of
love
even
from
admitting
that
it
has
that
nature
they
two
were
to
love
to
love
for
the
first
time
he
understood
a
little
of
what
that
meant
a
few
stolen
adoring
minutes
now
and
then
and
for
the
rest
the
presence
of
a
world
that
must
be
deceived
already
he
had
almost
a
hatred
of
that
orderly
colonel
with
his
eyes
that
looked
so
steady
and
saw
nothing
of
that
flat
kindly
lady
who
talked
so
pleasantly
throughout
dinner
saying
things
that
he
had
to
answer
without
knowing
what
they
signified
he
realized
with
a
sense
of
shock
that
he
was
deprived
of
all
interests
in
life
but
one
not
even
his
work
had
any
meaning
apart
from
her
it
lit
no
fire
within
him
to
hear
ercott
praise
certain
execrable
pictures
in
the
royal
academy
which
she
had
religiously
visited
the
day
before
leaving
home
and
as
the
interminable
meal
wore
on
he
began
even
to
feel
grief
and
wonder
that
olive
could
be
so
smiling
so
gay
and
calm
so
as
it
seemed
to
him
indifferent
to
this
intolerable
impossibility
of
exchanging
even
one
look
of
love
did
she
really
love
she
love
him
and
show
not
one
little
sign
of
it
and
suddenly
he
felt
her
foot
touch
his
own
it
was
the
faintest
sidelong
supplicating
pressure
withdrawn
at
once
but
it
said
know
what
you
are
suffering
i
too
but
i
love
you
characteristically
he
felt
that
it
cost
her
dear
to
make
use
of
that
little
primitive
device
of
common
loves
the
touch
awoke
within
him
only
chivalry
he
would
burn
for
ever
sooner
than
cause
her
the
pain
of
thinking
that
he
was
not
happy
after
dinner
they
sat
out
on
a
balcony
the
stars
glowed
above
the
palms
a
frog
was
croaking
he
managed
to
draw
his
chair
so
that
he
could
look
at
her
unseen
how
deep
and
softly
dark
her
eyes
when
for
a
second
they
rested
on
his
a
moth
settled
on
her
cunning
little
creature
with
its
hooded
horned
owl
face
and
tiny
black
slits
of
eyes
would
it
have
come
so
confidingly
to
anyone
but
her
the
colonel
knew
its
had
collected
it
very
common
he
said
the
interest
in
it
passed
but
lennan
stayed
bent
forward
gazing
at
that
knee
the
voice
of
ercott
sharper
than
its
wont
said
what
day
does
robert
say
he
wants
you
back
my
dear
he
managed
to
remain
gazing
at
the
moth
even
to
take
it
gently
from
her
knee
while
he
listened
to
her
calm
answer
tuesday
i
then
he
got
up
and
let
the
moth
fly
into
the
darkness
his
hands
and
lips
were
trembling
and
he
was
afraid
of
their
being
seen
he
had
never
known
had
not
dreamed
of
such
a
violent
sick
feeling
that
this
man
could
thus
hale
her
home
at
will
it
was
grotesque
fantastic
awful
was
true
next
tuesday
she
would
journey
back
away
from
him
to
be
again
at
the
mercy
of
her
fate
the
pain
of
this
thought
made
him
grip
the
railing
and
grit
his
teeth
to
keep
himself
from
crying
out
and
another
thought
came
to
him
i
shall
have
to
go
about
with
this
feeling
day
and
night
and
keep
it
secret
they
were
saying
and
he
had
to
smirk
and
smile
and
her
above
he
was
happy
and
he
could
see
that
she
knew
it
was
pretence
then
he
was
alone
with
the
feeling
that
he
had
failed
her
at
the
first
shot
torn
too
between
horror
of
what
he
suddenly
saw
before
him
and
longing
to
be
back
in
her
presence
at
any
cost
and
all
this
on
the
day
of
that
first
kiss
which
had
seemed
to
him
to
make
her
so
utterly
his
own
he
sat
down
on
a
bench
facing
the
casino
neither
the
lights
nor
the
people
passing
in
and
out
not
even
the
gipsy
bandsmen
music
distracted
his
thoughts
for
a
second
could
it
be
less
than
hours
since
he
had
picked
up
her
handkerchief
not
thirty
yards
away
in
that
hours
he
seemed
to
have
known
every
emotion
that
man
could
feel
and
in
all
the
world
there
was
now
not
one
soul
to
whom
he
could
speak
his
real
even
to
her
because
from
her
beyond
all
he
must
keep
at
any
cost
all
knowledge
of
his
unhappiness
so
this
was
illicit
it
was
called
loneliness
and
torture
not
her
heart
was
his
but
amazement
outrage
fear
endless
lonely
suffering
and
nobody
if
they
knew
would
care
or
pity
him
one
jot
was
there
really
then
as
the
ancients
thought
a
daemon
that
liked
to
play
with
men
as
men
liked
to
stir
an
earwig
and
turn
it
over
and
put
a
foot
on
it
in
the
end
he
got
up
and
made
his
way
towards
the
there
was
the
bench
where
she
had
been
sitting
when
he
came
on
her
that
very
morning
the
stars
in
their
courses
had
seemed
to
fight
for
them
then
but
whether
for
joy
he
no
longer
knew
and
there
on
the
seat
were
still
the
pepper
berries
she
had
crushed
and
strewn
he
broke
off
another
bunch
and
bruised
them
that
scent
was
the
ghost
of
sacred
minutes
when
her
hand
lay
against
his
own
the
stars
in
their
joy
or
sorrow
vii
there
was
no
peace
now
for
colonel
and
ercott
they
felt
themselves
conspirators
and
of
conspiracy
they
had
never
had
the
habit
yet
how
could
they
openly
deal
with
anxieties
which
had
arisen
solely
from
what
they
had
chanced
secretly
to
see
what
was
not
intended
for
one
eyes
and
ears
did
not
exist
no
canon
of
conduct
could
be
quite
so
sacred
as
well
defend
the
opening
of
another
person
letters
as
admit
the
possibility
of
making
use
of
adventitious
knowledge
so
far
tradition
and
indeed
character
made
them
feel
at
one
and
conspire
freely
but
they
diverged
on
a
deeper
plane
ercott
had
said
indeed
that
here
was
something
which
could
not
be
controlled
the
colonel
had
felt
very
different
thing
less
tolerant
in
theory
he
was
touched
at
heart
ercott
in
theory
almost
read
that
dangerous
authoress
george
heart
felt
cold
towards
her
husband
niece
for
these
reasons
they
could
not
in
fact
conspire
without
in
the
end
saying
suddenly
well
it
no
good
talking
about
it
and
almost
at
once
beginning
to
talk
about
it
again
in
proposing
to
her
that
mule
the
colonel
had
not
had
time
or
rather
not
quite
conviction
enough
as
to
his
line
of
action
to
explain
so
immediately
the
new
need
for
her
to
sit
upon
it
it
was
only
when
to
his
somewhat
strange
relief
she
had
refused
the
expedition
and
olive
had
started
without
them
that
he
told
her
of
the
meeting
in
the
gardens
of
which
he
had
been
witness
she
then
said
at
once
that
if
she
had
known
she
would
of
course
have
put
up
with
anything
in
order
to
go
not
because
she
approved
of
interfering
but
because
they
must
think
of
robert
and
the
colonel
had
said
the
fellow
and
there
the
matter
had
rested
for
the
moment
for
both
of
them
were
wondering
a
little
which
fellow
it
was
that
he
had
damned
that
indeed
was
the
trouble
if
the
colonel
had
not
cared
so
much
about
his
niece
and
had
liked
instead
of
rather
disliking
cramier
if
ercott
had
not
found
mark
lennan
a
boy
and
had
not
secretly
felt
her
husband
niece
rather
dangerous
to
her
peace
of
mind
if
in
few
words
those
three
had
been
puppets
made
of
wood
and
worked
by
law
it
would
have
been
so
much
simpler
for
all
concerned
it
was
the
discovery
that
there
was
a
personal
equation
in
such
matters
instead
of
just
a
simple
rule
of
three
which
disorganized
the
colonel
and
made
him
almost
angry
which
depressed
ercott
and
made
her
almost
silent
these
two
good
souls
had
stumbled
on
a
problem
which
has
divided
the
world
from
birth
shall
cases
be
decided
on
their
individual
merits
or
according
to
formal
codes
beneath
an
appearance
and
a
vocabulary
more
orthodox
than
ever
the
colonel
allegiance
to
authority
and
the
laws
of
form
was
really
shaken
he
simply
could
not
get
out
of
his
head
the
sight
of
those
two
young
people
sitting
side
by
side
nor
the
tone
of
olive
voice
when
she
had
repeated
his
regrettable
words
about
happiness
at
home
if
only
the
thing
had
not
been
so
human
if
only
she
had
been
someone
else
niece
it
would
clearly
have
been
her
duty
to
remain
unhappy
as
it
was
the
more
he
thought
the
less
he
knew
what
to
think
a
man
who
had
never
had
any
balance
to
speak
of
at
his
bank
and
from
the
nomadic
condition
of
his
life
had
no
exaggerated
feeling
for
a
settled
social
society
in
fact
rather
a
did
not
unduly
exaggerate
the
worldly
dangers
of
this
affair
neither
did
he
honestly
believe
that
she
would
burn
in
everlasting
torment
if
she
did
not
succeed
in
remaining
true
to
great
black
chap
as
he
secretly
called
cramier
his
feeling
was
simply
that
it
was
an
awful
pity
a
sort
of
unhappy
conviction
that
it
was
not
like
the
women
of
his
family
to
fall
upon
such
ways
that
his
dead
brother
would
turn
in
his
grave
in
two
words
that
it
was
done
yet
he
was
by
no
means
of
those
who
giving
latitude
to
women
in
general
fall
with
whips
on
those
of
their
own
family
who
take
it
on
the
contrary
believing
that
in
general
should
be
stainless
to
the
world
eye
he
was
inclined
to
make
allowance
for
any
individual
woman
that
he
knew
and
loved
a
suspicion
he
had
always
entertained
that
cramier
was
not
by
breeding
the
clean
potato
may
insensibly
have
influenced
him
just
a
little
he
had
heard
indeed
that
he
was
not
even
entitled
to
the
name
of
cramier
but
had
been
adopted
by
a
childless
man
who
had
brought
him
up
and
left
him
a
lot
of
money
there
was
something
in
this
that
went
against
the
grain
of
the
childless
colonel
he
had
never
adopted
nor
been
adopted
by
anyone
himself
there
was
a
certain
lack
about
a
man
who
had
been
adopted
of
reasonable
was
like
a
wine
or
a
horse
without
a
pedigree
you
could
not
quite
rely
on
what
he
might
do
having
no
tradition
in
his
blood
his
appearance
too
and
manner
somehow
lent
colour
to
this
distrust
a
touch
of
the
somewhere
and
a
stubborn
silent
pushing
fellow
why
on
earth
had
olive
ever
married
him
but
then
women
were
such
kittle
cattle
poor
things
and
old
lindsay
with
his
vestments
and
his
views
on
obedience
must
have
been
a
tartar
as
a
father
poor
old
chap
besides
cramier
no
doubt
was
what
most
women
would
call
more
taking
to
the
eye
than
such
a
quiet
fellow
as
young
lennan
whose
features
were
rather
anyhow
though
pleasant
enough
and
with
a
nice
sort
of
young
man
one
could
not
help
liking
and
who
certainly
would
never
hurt
a
fly
and
suddenly
there
came
the
thought
why
should
he
not
go
to
young
lennan
and
put
it
to
him
straight
that
he
was
in
love
with
olive
not
the
way
to
do
it
would
come
to
him
he
brooded
long
over
this
idea
and
spoke
of
it
to
ercott
while
shaving
the
next
morning
her
answer
my
dear
john
bosh
removed
his
last
doubt
without
saying
where
he
was
going
he
strolled
out
the
moment
after
took
a
train
to
beaulieu
at
the
young
man
hotel
he
sent
in
his
card
and
was
told
that
this
monsieur
had
already
gone
out
for
the
day
his
mood
of
marching
straight
up
to
the
guns
thus
checked
he
was
left
pensive
and
distraught
not
having
seen
beaulieu
they
spoke
of
it
then
as
a
coming
place
he
made
his
way
up
an
incline
that
whole
hillside
was
covered
with
thousands
of
these
flowers
were
starring
the
lower
air
and
the
strewn
petals
of
blown
and
fallen
roses
covered
the
light
soil
the
colonel
put
his
nose
to
blossoms
here
and
there
but
they
had
little
scent
as
if
they
knew
that
the
season
was
already
over
a
few
peasants
were
still
busy
among
them
and
suddenly
he
came
on
young
lennan
himself
sitting
on
a
stone
and
dabbing
away
with
his
fingers
at
a
lump
of
putty
stuff
the
colonel
hesitated
apart
from
obvious
reasons
for
discomfiture
he
had
that
feeling
towards
art
common
to
so
many
of
his
caste
it
was
not
work
of
course
but
it
was
very
mystery
to
him
how
anyone
could
do
it
on
seeing
him
lennan
had
risen
dropping
his
handkerchief
over
what
he
was
not
before
the
colonel
had
received
a
dim
impression
of
something
familiar
the
young
man
was
very
colonel
too
was
conscious
suddenly
of
the
heat
he
held
out
his
hand
nice
quiet
place
this
he
stammered
never
seen
it
before
i
called
at
your
now
that
he
had
his
chance
he
was
completely
at
a
loss
the
sight
of
the
face
emerging
from
that
lump
of
stuff
had
quite
unnerved
him
the
notion
of
this
young
man
working
at
it
up
here
all
by
himself
just
because
he
was
away
an
hour
or
two
from
the
original
touched
him
how
on
earth
to
say
what
he
had
come
to
say
it
was
altogether
different
from
what
he
had
thought
and
it
suddenly
flashed
through
was
right
she
always
it
you
busy
he
said
i
must
interrupt
not
at
all
sir
it
was
awfully
good
of
you
to
look
me
the
colonel
stared
there
was
something
about
young
lennan
that
he
had
not
noticed
before
a
take
liberties
with
me
look
that
made
things
difficult
but
still
he
lingered
staring
wistfully
at
the
young
man
who
stood
waiting
with
such
politeness
then
a
safe
question
shot
into
his
mind
ah
and
when
do
you
go
back
to
england
we
off
on
while
he
spoke
a
puff
of
wind
lifted
the
handkerchief
from
the
modelled
face
would
the
young
fellow
put
it
back
he
did
not
and
the
colonel
thought
it
would
have
been
bad
form
he
knew
i
would
take
advantage
yes
he
a
gentleman
lifting
his
hand
to
the
salute
he
said
well
i
must
be
getting
back
see
you
at
dinner
perhaps
and
turning
on
his
heel
he
marched
away
the
remembrance
of
that
face
in
the
stuff
up
there
by
the
side
of
the
road
accompanied
him
home
it
was
was
serious
and
the
sense
that
he
counted
for
nothing
in
all
of
it
grew
and
grew
in
him
he
told
no
one
of
where
he
had
been
when
the
colonel
turned
with
ceremony
and
left
him
lennan
sat
down
again
on
the
flat
stone
took
up
his
stuff
and
presently
effaced
that
image
he
sat
still
a
long
time
to
all
appearance
watching
the
little
blue
butterflies
playing
round
the
red
and
tawny
roses
then
his
fingers
began
to
work
feverishly
shaping
a
head
not
of
a
man
not
of
a
beast
but
a
sort
of
horned
heavy
mingling
of
the
two
there
was
something
frenetic
in
the
movement
of
those
rather
short
fingers
as
though
they
were
strangling
the
thing
they
were
creating
viii
in
those
days
such
as
had
served
their
country
travelled
as
befitted
spartans
in
ordinary
carriages
and
woke
in
the
morning
at
la
roche
or
some
place
for
paler
coffee
and
the
pale
brioche
so
it
was
with
colonel
and
ercott
and
their
niece
accompanied
by
books
they
did
not
read
viands
they
did
not
eat
and
one
somnolent
irishman
returning
from
the
east
in
the
disposition
of
legs
there
was
the
usual
difficulty
no
one
quite
liking
to
put
them
up
and
all
ultimately
doing
so
save
olive
more
than
once
during
that
night
the
colonel
lying
on
the
seat
opposite
awoke
and
saw
her
sitting
withdrawn
into
her
corner
with
eyes
still
open
staring
at
that
little
head
which
he
admired
so
much
upright
and
unmoving
in
its
dark
straw
toque
against
the
cushion
he
would
become
suddenly
alert
kicking
the
irishman
slightly
in
the
effort
he
would
slip
his
legs
down
bend
across
to
her
in
the
darkness
and
conscious
of
a
faint
fragrance
as
of
violets
whisper
huskily
anything
i
can
do
for
you
my
dear
when
she
had
smiled
and
shaken
her
head
he
would
retreat
and
after
holding
his
breath
to
see
if
dolly
were
asleep
would
restore
his
feet
slightly
kicking
the
irishman
after
one
such
expedition
for
full
ten
minutes
he
remained
awake
wondering
at
her
tireless
immobility
for
indeed
she
was
spending
this
night
entranced
with
the
feeling
that
lennan
was
beside
her
holding
her
hand
in
his
she
seemed
actually
to
feel
the
touch
of
his
finger
against
the
tiny
patch
of
her
bare
palm
where
the
glove
opened
it
was
wonderful
this
uncanny
communion
in
the
dark
rushing
would
not
have
slept
for
worlds
never
before
had
she
felt
so
close
to
him
not
even
when
he
had
kissed
her
that
once
under
the
olives
nor
even
when
at
the
concert
yesterday
his
arm
pressed
hers
and
his
voice
whispered
words
she
heard
so
thirstily
and
that
golden
fortnight
passed
and
passed
through
her
on
an
endless
band
of
reminiscence
its
memories
were
like
flowers
such
scent
and
warmth
and
colour
in
them
and
of
all
none
perhaps
quite
so
poignant
as
the
memory
of
the
moment
at
the
door
of
their
carriage
when
he
said
so
low
that
she
just
heard
my
darling
he
had
never
before
called
her
that
not
even
his
touch
on
her
cheek
under
the
olives
equalled
the
simple
treasure
of
that
word
and
above
the
roar
and
clatter
of
the
train
and
the
snoring
of
the
irishman
it
kept
sounding
in
her
ears
hour
after
dark
hour
it
was
perhaps
not
wonderful
that
through
all
that
night
she
never
once
looked
the
future
in
the
no
plans
took
no
stock
of
her
position
just
yielded
to
memory
and
to
the
sensation
of
his
presence
close
beside
her
whatever
might
come
afterwards
she
was
his
this
night
such
was
the
trance
that
gave
to
her
the
strange
soft
tireless
immobility
which
so
moved
her
uncle
whenever
he
woke
up
in
paris
they
drove
from
station
to
station
in
a
vehicle
unfit
for
stretch
their
the
colonel
said
since
he
saw
in
his
niece
no
signs
of
flagging
no
regret
his
spirits
were
rising
and
he
confided
to
ercott
in
the
buffet
at
the
gare
du
nord
when
olive
had
gone
to
wash
that
he
did
not
think
there
was
much
in
it
after
all
looking
at
the
way
she
travelled
but
ercott
answered
have
you
ever
noticed
that
olive
never
shows
what
she
does
not
want
to
she
has
not
got
those
eyes
for
what
eyes
eyes
that
see
everything
and
seem
to
see
conscious
that
something
was
hurting
her
the
colonel
tried
to
take
her
hand
but
ercott
rose
quickly
and
went
where
he
could
not
follow
thus
suddenly
deserted
the
colonel
brooded
drumming
on
the
little
table
what
now
dolly
was
unjust
poor
dolly
he
was
as
fond
of
her
as
ever
of
course
how
could
he
help
olive
being
pretty
how
could
he
help
looking
after
her
and
wanting
to
save
her
from
this
mess
thus
he
sat
wondering
dismayed
by
the
unreasonableness
of
women
it
did
not
enter
his
head
that
ercott
had
been
almost
as
sleepless
as
his
niece
watching
through
closed
eyes
every
one
of
those
little
expeditions
of
his
and
saying
to
herself
ah
he
does
care
how
i
travel
she
returned
serene
enough
concealing
her
and
soon
they
were
once
more
whirling
towards
england
but
the
future
had
begun
to
lay
its
hand
on
olive
the
spell
of
the
past
was
already
losing
power
the
sense
that
it
had
all
been
a
dream
grew
stronger
every
minute
in
a
few
hours
she
would
the
little
house
close
under
the
shadow
of
that
old
wren
church
which
reminded
her
somehow
of
childhood
and
her
austere
father
with
his
chiselled
face
the
meeting
with
her
husband
how
go
through
that
and
but
she
did
not
care
to
contemplate
and
all
those
wherein
there
was
nothing
she
had
to
do
of
which
it
was
reasonable
to
complain
yet
nothing
she
could
do
without
feeling
that
all
the
friendliness
and
zest
and
colour
was
out
of
life
and
she
a
prisoner
into
those
she
felt
she
would
slip
back
out
of
her
dream
lost
with
hardly
perhaps
an
effort
to
get
away
to
the
house
on
the
river
where
her
husband
came
only
at
weekends
had
hitherto
been
a
refuge
only
she
would
not
see
mark
then
with
the
thought
that
she
would
must
still
see
him
sometimes
all
again
grew
faintly
glamorous
if
only
she
did
see
him
what
would
the
rest
matter
never
again
as
it
had
before
the
colonel
was
reaching
down
her
handbag
his
cheery
looks
as
if
it
would
be
rough
aroused
her
glad
to
be
alone
and
tired
enough
now
she
sought
the
ladies
cabin
and
slept
through
the
crossing
till
the
voice
of
the
old
stewardess
awakened
her
you
had
a
nice
sleep
we
alongside
ah
if
she
were
but
that
now
she
had
been
dreaming
that
she
was
sitting
in
a
flowery
field
and
lennan
had
drawn
her
up
by
the
hands
with
the
words
we
here
my
darling
on
deck
the
colonel
laden
with
bags
was
looking
back
for
her
and
trying
to
keep
a
space
between
him
and
his
wife
he
signalled
with
his
chin
threading
her
way
towards
him
she
happened
to
look
up
by
the
rails
of
the
pier
above
she
saw
her
husband
he
was
leaning
there
looking
intently
down
his
tall
broad
figure
made
the
people
on
each
side
of
him
seem
insignificant
the
face
with
those
almost
epileptic
forceful
eyes
had
a
stillness
and
intensity
beside
which
the
neighbouring
faces
seemed
to
disappear
she
saw
him
very
clearly
even
noting
the
touch
of
silver
in
his
dark
hair
on
each
side
under
his
straw
hat
noting
that
he
seemed
too
massive
for
his
neat
blue
suit
his
face
relaxed
he
made
a
little
movement
of
one
hand
suddenly
it
shot
through
her
suppose
mark
had
travelled
with
them
as
he
had
wished
to
do
for
ever
and
ever
now
that
dark
massive
creature
smiling
down
at
her
was
her
enemy
from
whom
she
must
guard
and
keep
herself
if
she
could
keep
at
all
events
each
one
of
her
real
thoughts
and
hopes
she
could
have
writhed
and
cried
out
instead
she
tightened
her
grip
on
the
handle
of
her
bag
and
smiled
though
so
skilled
in
knowledge
of
his
moods
she
felt
in
his
greeting
his
fierce
grip
of
her
shoulders
the
smouldering
of
some
feeling
the
nature
of
which
she
could
not
quite
fathom
his
voice
had
a
grim
sincerity
glad
you
were
never
coming
resigned
to
his
charge
a
feeling
of
sheer
physical
faintness
so
beset
her
that
she
could
hardly
reach
the
compartment
he
had
reserved
it
seemed
to
her
that
for
all
her
foreboding
she
had
not
till
this
moment
had
the
smallest
inkling
of
what
was
now
before
her
and
at
his
muttered
must
we
have
the
old
fossils
in
she
looked
back
to
assure
herself
that
her
uncle
and
aunt
were
following
to
avoid
having
to
talk
she
feigned
to
have
travelled
badly
leaning
back
with
closed
eyes
in
her
corner
if
only
she
could
open
them
and
see
not
this
face
with
its
intent
gaze
of
possession
but
that
other
with
its
eager
eyes
humbly
adoring
her
the
interminable
journey
ended
all
too
soon
she
clung
quite
desperately
to
the
colonel
hand
on
the
platform
at
charing
cross
when
his
kind
face
vanished
she
would
be
lost
indeed
then
in
the
closed
cab
she
heard
her
husband
are
you
going
to
kiss
me
and
submitted
to
his
embrace
she
tried
so
hard
to
think
what
does
it
matter
it
not
i
not
my
soul
my
my
miserable
lips
she
heard
him
say
you
do
seem
too
glad
to
see
me
and
then
i
hear
you
had
young
lennan
out
there
what
was
he
doing
she
felt
the
turmoil
of
sudden
fear
wondered
whether
she
was
showing
it
lost
it
in
unnatural
in
the
second
before
she
answered
oh
just
a
some
seconds
passed
and
then
he
said
you
did
mention
him
in
your
she
answered
coolly
did
i
we
saw
a
good
deal
of
she
knew
that
he
was
looking
at
inquisitive
regard
why
she
not
then
and
there
cry
out
and
i
love
you
hear
love
him
so
awful
did
it
seem
to
be
denying
her
love
with
these
half
lies
but
it
was
all
so
much
more
grim
and
hopeless
than
even
she
had
thought
how
inconceivable
now
that
she
had
ever
given
herself
up
to
this
man
for
life
if
only
she
could
get
away
from
him
to
her
room
and
scheme
and
think
for
his
eyes
never
left
her
travelling
over
her
with
their
pathetic
greed
their
menacing
inquiry
till
he
said
well
it
not
done
you
any
harm
you
look
very
but
his
touch
was
too
much
even
for
her
and
she
recoiled
as
if
he
had
struck
her
what
the
matter
did
i
hurt
you
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
realized
as
vividly
that
he
was
not
and
the
full
danger
to
her
perhaps
to
mark
himself
of
shrinking
from
this
man
striking
her
with
all
its
pitiable
force
she
made
a
painful
effort
slipped
her
hand
under
his
arm
and
said
very
tired
you
startled
but
he
put
her
hand
away
and
turning
his
face
stared
out
of
the
window
and
so
they
reached
their
home
when
he
had
left
her
alone
she
remained
where
she
was
standing
by
her
wardrobe
without
sound
or
movement
thinking
what
am
i
going
to
do
how
am
i
going
to
live
ix
when
mark
lennan
travelling
through
from
beaulieu
reached
his
rooms
in
chelsea
he
went
at
once
to
the
little
pile
of
his
letters
twice
hunted
through
them
then
stood
very
still
with
a
stunned
sick
feeling
why
had
she
not
sent
him
that
promised
note
and
now
he
not
yet
to
the
it
meant
to
be
in
love
with
a
married
woman
he
must
wait
in
this
suspense
for
eighteen
hours
at
least
till
he
could
call
and
find
out
what
had
happened
to
prevent
her
till
he
could
hear
from
her
lips
that
she
still
loved
him
the
chilliest
of
legal
lovers
had
access
to
his
love
but
he
must
possess
a
soul
that
was
on
fire
in
this
deadly
patience
for
fear
of
doing
something
that
might
jeopardize
her
telegraph
he
dared
not
write
she
would
get
it
by
the
first
post
but
what
could
he
say
that
was
not
dangerous
if
cramier
chanced
to
see
call
still
more
impossible
till
three
at
very
earliest
his
gaze
wandered
round
the
studio
were
these
household
gods
and
all
these
works
of
his
indeed
the
same
he
had
left
twenty
days
ago
they
seemed
to
exist
now
only
in
so
far
as
she
might
come
to
see
and
sit
in
such
a
chair
and
drink
out
of
such
a
cup
and
let
him
put
this
cushion
for
her
back
and
that
footstool
for
her
feet
and
so
vividly
could
he
see
her
lying
back
in
that
chair
looking
across
at
him
that
he
could
hardly
believe
she
had
never
yet
sat
there
it
was
odd
any
resolution
taken
without
admission
that
their
love
could
not
remain
platonic
without
any
change
in
their
relations
save
one
humble
kiss
and
a
few
whispered
was
changed
a
month
or
so
ago
if
he
had
wanted
he
would
have
gone
at
once
calmly
to
her
house
it
would
have
seemed
harmless
and
quite
natural
now
it
was
impossible
to
do
openly
the
least
thing
that
strict
convention
did
not
find
desirable
sooner
or
later
they
would
find
him
stepping
over
convention
and
take
him
for
what
he
was
real
lover
a
real
lover
he
knelt
down
before
the
empty
chair
and
stretched
out
his
arms
no
longing
that
passed
through
air
as
the
wind
through
grass
he
went
to
the
little
round
window
which
overlooked
the
river
the
last
evening
of
may
gloaming
above
the
water
dusk
resting
in
the
trees
and
the
air
warm
better
to
be
out
and
moving
in
the
night
out
in
the
ebb
and
flow
of
things
among
others
whose
hearts
were
beating
than
stay
in
this
place
that
without
her
was
so
cold
and
meaningless
of
turning
from
pallor
to
full
orange
and
the
stars
were
coming
out
nine
at
ten
and
not
before
he
would
walk
past
her
house
to
have
this
something
to
look
forward
to
however
furtive
and
barren
helped
but
on
a
saturday
night
there
would
be
no
sitting
at
the
house
cramier
would
be
at
home
or
they
would
both
be
out
or
perhaps
have
gone
down
to
their
river
cottage
cramier
what
cruel
demon
had
presided
over
that
marring
of
her
life
why
had
he
never
met
her
till
after
she
had
bound
herself
to
this
man
from
a
negative
contempt
for
one
who
was
either
not
sensitive
enough
to
recognize
that
his
marriage
was
a
failure
or
not
chivalrous
enough
to
make
that
failure
bear
as
little
hardly
as
possible
on
his
wife
he
had
come
already
to
jealous
hatred
as
of
a
monster
to
be
face
to
face
with
cramier
in
a
mortal
conflict
could
alone
have
satisfied
his
feeling
yet
he
was
a
young
man
by
nature
gentle
his
heart
beat
desperately
as
he
approached
that
of
those
little
old
streets
so
beautiful
that
belonged
to
a
vanished
london
it
was
very
narrow
there
was
no
shelter
and
he
thought
confusedly
of
what
he
could
say
if
met
in
this
remote
backwater
that
led
nowhere
he
would
tell
some
lie
no
doubt
lies
would
now
be
his
daily
business
lies
and
hatred
those
violent
things
of
life
would
come
to
seem
quite
natural
in
the
violence
of
his
love
he
stood
a
moment
hesitating
by
the
rails
of
the
old
church
black
with
shadowy
summits
in
that
half
darkness
it
was
like
some
gigantic
vision
mystery
itself
seemed
modelled
there
he
turned
and
walked
quickly
down
the
street
close
to
the
houses
on
the
further
side
the
windows
of
her
house
were
lighted
so
she
was
not
away
dim
light
in
the
lights
in
the
room
bedroom
doubtless
was
there
no
way
to
bring
her
to
the
window
no
way
his
spirit
could
climb
up
there
and
beckon
hers
out
to
him
perhaps
she
was
not
there
perhaps
it
was
but
a
servant
taking
up
hot
water
he
was
at
the
end
of
the
street
by
now
but
to
leave
without
once
more
passing
was
impossible
and
this
time
he
went
slowly
his
head
down
feigning
abstraction
grudging
every
inch
of
pavement
and
all
the
time
furtively
searching
that
window
with
the
light
behind
the
curtains
nothing
once
more
he
was
close
to
the
railings
of
the
church
and
once
more
could
not
bring
himself
to
go
away
in
the
little
close
deserted
street
not
a
soul
was
moving
not
even
a
cat
or
dog
nothing
alive
but
many
discreet
lighted
windows
like
veiled
faces
showing
no
emotion
they
seemed
to
watch
his
indecision
and
he
thought
ah
well
i
dare
say
there
are
lots
like
me
lots
as
near
and
yet
as
far
away
lots
who
have
to
suffer
but
what
would
he
not
have
given
for
the
throwing
open
of
those
curtains
then
suddenly
scared
by
an
approaching
figure
he
turned
and
walked
away
x
at
three
next
day
he
called
in
the
middle
of
her
white
whose
latticed
window
ran
the
whole
length
of
one
wall
stood
a
little
table
on
which
was
a
silver
jar
full
of
early
larkspurs
evidently
from
her
garden
by
the
river
and
lennan
waited
his
eyes
fixed
on
those
blossoms
so
like
to
little
blue
butterflies
and
crickets
tethered
to
the
pale
green
stems
in
this
room
she
passed
her
days
guarded
from
him
once
a
week
at
most
he
would
be
able
to
come
a
week
for
an
hour
or
two
of
the
hundred
and
hours
that
he
longed
to
be
with
her
and
suddenly
he
was
conscious
of
her
she
had
come
in
without
sound
and
was
standing
by
the
piano
so
pale
in
her
dress
that
her
eyes
looked
jet
black
he
hardly
knew
that
face
like
a
flower
closed
against
cold
what
had
he
done
what
had
happened
in
these
five
days
to
make
her
like
this
to
him
he
took
her
hands
and
tried
to
kiss
them
but
she
said
quickly
he
in
at
that
he
stood
silent
looking
into
that
face
frozen
to
a
dreadful
composure
on
the
breaking
up
of
which
his
very
life
seemed
to
depend
at
last
he
said
what
is
it
am
i
nothing
to
you
after
all
but
as
soon
as
he
had
spoken
he
saw
that
he
need
not
have
asked
and
flung
his
arms
round
her
she
clung
to
him
with
desperation
then
freed
herself
and
said
no
no
let
sit
down
quietly
he
obeyed
to
admit
all
that
lay
behind
that
strange
coldness
and
this
desperate
embrace
all
the
and
shame
rage
and
longing
of
a
married
woman
for
the
first
time
face
to
face
with
her
lover
in
her
husband
house
she
seemed
now
to
be
trying
to
make
him
forget
her
strange
behaviour
to
be
what
she
had
been
during
that
fortnight
in
the
sunshine
but
suddenly
just
moving
her
lips
she
said
quick
when
can
we
see
each
other
i
will
come
to
you
to
and
following
her
eyes
he
saw
the
door
opening
and
cramier
coming
in
unsmiling
very
big
in
the
low
room
he
crossed
over
to
them
and
offered
his
hand
to
lennan
then
drawing
a
low
chair
forward
between
their
two
chairs
sat
down
so
you
back
he
said
have
a
good
time
thanks
yes
luck
for
olive
you
were
there
those
places
are
dull
it
was
luck
for
no
and
with
those
words
he
turned
to
his
wife
his
elbows
rested
along
the
arms
of
his
chair
so
that
his
clenched
palms
were
upwards
it
was
as
if
he
knew
that
he
was
holding
those
two
gripped
one
in
each
hand
i
wonder
he
said
slowly
that
fellows
like
you
with
nothing
in
the
world
to
tie
them
ever
sit
down
in
a
place
like
london
i
should
have
thought
rome
or
paris
were
your
happy
in
his
voice
in
those
eyes
of
his
a
little
bloodshot
with
their
look
of
power
in
his
whole
attitude
there
was
a
sort
of
muffled
menace
and
contempt
as
though
he
were
thinking
step
into
my
path
and
i
will
crush
you
and
lennan
thought
how
long
must
i
sit
here
then
past
that
figure
planted
solidly
between
them
he
caught
a
look
from
her
swift
sure
marvellously
and
if
she
were
being
urged
by
the
very
presence
of
this
danger
one
of
those
glances
would
be
seen
by
cramier
is
there
need
for
fear
that
a
swallow
should
dash
itself
against
the
wall
over
which
it
skims
but
he
got
up
unable
to
bear
it
longer
going
that
one
suave
word
had
an
inimitable
insolence
he
could
hardly
see
his
hand
touching
cramier
heavy
fist
then
he
realized
that
she
was
standing
so
that
their
faces
when
they
must
say
could
not
be
seen
her
eyes
were
smiling
yet
imploring
her
lips
shaped
the
word
and
squeezing
her
hand
desperately
he
got
away
he
had
never
dreamed
that
to
see
her
in
the
presence
of
the
man
who
owned
her
would
be
so
terrible
for
a
moment
he
thought
that
he
must
give
her
up
give
up
a
love
that
would
drive
him
mad
he
climbed
on
to
an
omnibus
travelling
west
another
hours
of
starvation
had
begun
it
did
not
matter
at
all
what
he
did
with
them
they
were
simply
so
much
aching
that
had
to
be
got
through
much
aching
and
what
relief
at
the
end
an
hour
or
two
with
her
desperately
holding
himself
in
like
most
artists
and
few
englishmen
he
lived
on
feelings
rather
than
on
facts
so
found
no
refuge
in
decisive
resolutions
but
he
made
resolution
to
give
her
up
to
be
true
to
the
ideal
of
service
for
no
reward
to
beseech
her
to
leave
cramier
and
come
to
he
made
each
many
times
at
hyde
park
corner
he
got
down
and
went
into
the
park
thinking
that
to
walk
would
help
him
a
great
number
of
people
were
sitting
there
taking
mysterious
anodyne
doing
the
right
thing
to
avoid
them
he
kept
along
the
rails
and
ran
almost
into
the
arms
of
colonel
and
ercott
who
were
coming
from
the
direction
of
knightsbridge
slightly
flushed
having
lunched
and
talked
of
at
the
house
of
a
certain
general
they
greeted
him
with
the
surprise
of
those
who
had
said
to
each
other
many
times
that
young
man
will
come
rushing
back
it
was
very
run
across
him
when
did
he
arrive
they
had
thought
he
was
going
on
to
was
looking
rather
tired
they
did
not
ask
if
he
had
seen
too
kind
and
perhaps
afraid
that
he
would
say
which
would
be
embarrassing
or
that
he
would
say
which
would
be
still
more
embarrassing
when
they
found
that
he
ought
to
have
said
would
he
not
come
and
sit
with
them
a
were
going
presently
to
see
how
olive
was
lennan
perceived
that
they
were
warning
him
and
forcing
himself
to
look
at
them
very
straight
he
said
i
have
just
been
ercott
phrased
her
impressions
that
same
evening
he
looks
quite
hunted
poor
young
man
i
afraid
there
going
to
be
fearful
trouble
there
did
you
notice
how
quickly
he
ran
away
from
us
he
thin
too
if
it
was
for
his
tan
he
look
really
ill
the
boy
eyes
are
so
pathetic
and
he
used
to
have
such
a
nice
smile
in
the
colonel
who
was
fastening
her
hooks
paused
in
an
operation
that
required
concentration
it
a
thousand
pities
he
muttered
that
he
has
any
work
to
do
that
puddling
about
with
clay
or
whatever
he
does
is
no
good
at
and
slowly
fastening
one
hook
he
unhooked
several
others
ercott
went
on
and
i
saw
olive
when
she
thought
i
was
looking
it
was
just
as
if
she
taken
off
a
mask
but
robert
cramier
will
never
put
up
with
it
he
in
love
with
her
still
i
watched
him
it
tragic
the
colonel
let
his
hands
fall
from
the
hooks
if
i
thought
that
he
said
i
do
if
you
could
it
would
not
be
the
colonel
stared
there
was
always
something
to
be
done
you
read
too
many
novels
he
said
but
without
spirit
ercott
smiled
and
made
no
answer
to
an
aspersion
she
had
heard
before
xi
when
lennan
reached
his
rooms
again
after
that
encounter
with
the
ercotts
he
found
in
his
letterbox
a
visiting
card
mrs
doone
miss
sylvia
doone
and
on
it
pencilled
the
words
do
come
and
see
us
before
we
go
down
to
he
stared
blankly
at
the
round
handwriting
he
knew
so
well
sylvia
nothing
perhaps
could
have
made
so
plain
to
him
how
in
this
tornado
of
his
passion
the
world
was
drowned
sylvia
he
had
almost
forgotten
her
existence
and
yet
only
last
year
after
he
definitely
settled
down
in
london
he
had
once
more
seen
a
good
deal
of
her
and
even
had
soft
thoughts
of
her
her
hair
her
true
look
her
sweetness
then
they
had
gone
for
the
winter
to
algiers
for
her
mother
health
when
they
came
back
he
had
already
avoided
seeing
her
though
that
was
before
olive
went
to
monte
carlo
before
he
had
even
admitted
his
own
feeling
and
had
not
once
thought
of
her
not
once
the
world
had
indeed
vanished
do
come
and
see
the
very
notion
was
an
irritation
no
rest
from
aching
and
impatience
to
be
had
that
way
and
then
the
idea
came
to
him
why
not
kill
these
hours
of
waiting
for
meeting
by
going
on
the
river
passing
by
her
cottage
there
was
still
one
train
that
he
could
catch
he
reached
the
village
after
dark
and
spent
the
night
at
the
inn
got
up
early
next
morning
took
a
boat
and
pulled
the
bluffs
of
the
opposite
bank
were
wooded
with
high
trees
the
sun
shone
softly
on
their
leaves
and
the
bright
stream
was
ruffled
by
a
breeze
that
bent
all
the
reeds
and
slowly
swayed
the
one
thin
white
line
of
wind
streaked
the
blue
sky
he
shipped
his
sculls
and
drifted
listening
to
the
watching
the
swallows
chasing
if
only
she
were
here
to
spend
one
long
day
thus
drifting
with
the
stream
to
have
but
one
such
rest
from
longing
her
cottage
he
knew
lay
on
the
same
side
as
the
village
and
just
beyond
an
island
she
had
told
him
of
a
hedge
of
and
a
white
dovecote
almost
at
the
water
edge
he
came
to
the
island
and
let
his
boat
slide
into
the
backwater
it
was
all
overgrown
with
and
alders
dark
even
in
this
early
morning
radiance
and
marvellously
still
there
was
no
room
to
row
he
took
the
boathook
and
tried
to
punt
but
the
green
water
was
too
deep
and
entangled
with
great
roots
so
that
he
had
to
make
his
way
by
clawing
with
the
hook
at
branches
birds
seemed
to
shun
this
gloom
but
a
single
magpie
crossed
the
one
little
clear
patch
of
sky
and
flew
low
behind
the
willows
the
air
here
had
a
sweetish
earthy
odour
of
too
rank
foliage
all
brightness
seemed
entombed
he
was
glad
to
pass
out
again
under
a
huge
into
the
fluttering
gold
and
silver
of
the
morning
and
almost
at
once
he
saw
the
at
the
border
of
some
bright
green
turf
and
a
high
on
its
pole
painted
about
it
a
number
of
and
pigeons
were
perched
or
flying
and
beyond
the
lawn
he
could
see
the
dark
veranda
of
a
low
house
covered
by
wistaria
just
going
out
of
flower
a
drift
of
scent
from
late
lilacs
and
grass
was
borne
out
to
him
together
with
the
sound
of
a
and
the
humming
of
many
bees
it
was
beautiful
here
and
seemed
for
all
its
restfulness
to
have
something
of
that
flying
quality
he
so
loved
about
her
face
about
the
sweep
of
her
hair
the
quick
soft
turn
of
her
was
that
but
the
darkness
of
the
the
whiteness
of
the
dovecote
and
the
doves
themselves
flying
he
lay
there
a
long
time
quietly
beneath
the
bank
careful
not
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
old
gardener
who
was
methodically
pushing
his
machine
across
and
across
the
lawn
how
he
wanted
her
with
him
then
wonderful
that
there
could
be
in
life
such
beauty
and
wild
softness
as
made
the
heart
ache
with
the
delight
of
it
and
in
that
same
life
grey
rules
and
rigid
of
happiness
that
doors
should
be
closed
on
love
and
joy
there
was
not
so
much
of
it
in
the
world
she
who
was
the
very
spirit
of
this
flying
summer
was
untimely
in
bleak
sorrow
there
was
a
hateful
unwisdom
in
that
thought
it
seemed
so
grim
and
violent
so
gruesome
narrow
and
extravagant
what
possible
end
could
it
serve
that
she
should
be
unhappy
even
if
he
had
not
loved
her
he
would
have
hated
her
fate
just
as
such
stories
of
imprisoned
lives
had
roused
his
anger
even
as
a
boy
soft
white
bright
angels
of
the
river
never
very
long
begun
now
to
spread
their
wings
over
the
woods
and
the
wind
had
dropped
so
that
the
slumbrous
warmth
and
murmuring
of
summer
gathered
full
over
the
water
the
old
gardener
had
finished
his
job
of
mowing
and
came
with
a
little
basket
of
grain
to
feed
the
doves
lennan
watched
them
going
to
him
the
very
dainty
and
capricious
keeping
to
themselves
in
place
of
that
old
fellow
he
was
really
seeing
her
feeding
from
her
hands
those
birds
of
cypris
what
a
group
he
could
have
made
of
her
with
them
perching
and
flying
round
her
if
she
were
his
what
could
he
not
make
her
the
old
greeks
and
italians
who
in
their
work
had
rescued
their
mistresses
from
time
he
was
back
in
his
rooms
in
london
two
hours
before
he
dared
begin
expecting
her
living
alone
there
but
for
a
caretaker
who
came
every
morning
for
an
hour
or
two
made
dust
and
departed
he
had
no
need
for
caution
and
when
he
had
procured
flowers
and
the
fruits
and
cakes
which
they
certainly
would
not
he
had
arranged
the
and
made
the
grand
tour
at
least
twenty
times
he
placed
himself
with
a
book
at
the
little
round
window
to
watch
for
her
approach
there
very
still
he
sat
not
reading
a
word
continually
moistening
his
dry
lips
and
sighing
to
relieve
the
tension
of
his
heart
at
last
he
saw
her
coming
she
was
walking
close
to
the
railings
of
the
houses
looking
neither
to
right
nor
left
she
had
on
a
lawn
frock
and
a
hat
of
the
palest
straw
with
a
narrow
black
velvet
ribbon
she
crossed
the
side
street
stopped
for
a
second
gave
a
swift
look
round
then
came
resolutely
on
what
was
it
made
him
love
her
so
what
was
the
secret
of
her
fascination
certainly
no
conscious
enticements
never
did
anyone
try
less
to
fascinate
he
could
not
recall
one
single
little
thing
that
she
had
done
to
draw
him
to
her
was
it
perhaps
her
very
passivity
her
native
pride
that
never
offered
or
asked
anything
a
sort
of
soft
stoicism
in
her
fibre
that
and
some
mysterious
charm
as
close
and
intimate
as
scent
was
to
a
flower
he
waited
to
open
till
he
heard
her
footstep
just
outside
she
came
in
without
a
word
not
even
looking
at
him
and
he
too
said
not
a
word
till
he
had
closed
the
door
and
made
sure
of
her
then
they
turned
to
each
other
her
breast
was
heaving
a
little
under
her
thin
frock
but
she
was
calmer
than
he
with
that
wonderful
composure
of
pretty
women
in
all
the
passages
of
love
as
who
should
say
this
is
my
native
air
they
stood
and
looked
at
each
other
as
if
they
could
never
have
enough
till
he
said
at
last
i
thought
i
should
die
before
this
moment
came
there
is
a
minute
that
i
do
long
for
you
so
terribly
that
i
can
hardly
and
do
you
think
that
i
do
long
for
you
then
come
to
me
she
looked
at
him
mournfully
and
shook
her
head
well
he
had
known
that
she
would
not
he
had
not
earned
her
what
right
had
he
to
ask
her
to
fly
against
the
world
to
brave
everything
to
have
such
faith
in
yet
he
had
no
heart
to
press
his
words
beginning
then
to
understand
the
paralyzing
truth
that
there
was
no
longer
any
resolving
this
or
that
with
love
like
his
he
had
ceased
to
be
a
separate
being
with
a
separate
will
he
was
entwined
with
her
could
act
only
if
her
will
and
his
were
one
he
would
never
be
able
to
say
to
her
must
he
loved
her
too
much
and
she
knew
it
so
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
forget
the
ache
and
make
the
hour
happy
but
how
about
that
other
in
love
there
is
no
pause
no
resting
with
any
watering
however
scant
the
flower
will
grow
till
its
time
comes
to
be
plucked
this
oasis
in
the
few
minutes
with
her
alone
were
swept
through
and
through
with
a
feverish
wind
to
be
closer
how
not
try
to
be
that
how
not
long
for
her
lips
when
he
had
but
her
hand
to
kiss
and
how
not
be
poisoned
with
the
thought
that
in
a
few
minutes
she
would
leave
him
and
go
back
to
the
presence
of
that
other
who
even
though
she
loathed
him
could
see
and
touch
her
when
he
would
she
was
leaning
back
in
the
very
chair
where
in
fancy
he
had
seen
her
and
he
only
dared
sit
at
her
feet
and
look
up
and
this
which
a
week
ago
would
have
been
rapture
was
now
almost
torture
so
far
did
it
fall
short
of
his
longing
it
was
torture
too
to
keep
his
voice
in
tune
with
the
sober
sweetness
of
her
voice
and
bitterly
he
thought
how
can
she
sit
there
and
not
want
me
as
i
want
her
then
at
a
touch
of
her
fingers
on
his
hair
he
lost
control
and
kissed
her
lips
her
surrender
lasted
only
for
a
second
no
must
not
that
mournful
surprise
sobered
him
at
once
he
got
up
stood
away
from
her
begged
to
be
forgiven
and
when
she
was
gone
he
sat
in
the
chair
where
she
had
sat
that
clasp
of
her
the
kiss
he
had
begged
her
to
forget
could
take
that
from
him
he
had
done
wrong
had
startled
her
had
fallen
short
of
chivalry
and
smile
of
utter
happiness
would
cling
about
his
lips
his
fastidiousness
his
imagination
almost
made
him
think
that
this
was
all
he
wanted
if
he
could
close
his
eyes
now
and
pass
out
before
he
lost
that
moment
of
and
the
smile
still
on
his
lips
he
lay
back
watching
the
flies
wheeling
and
chasing
round
the
sixteen
of
them
there
were
wheeling
and
still
xii
when
walking
from
lennan
studio
olive
reentered
her
dark
little
hall
she
approached
its
alcove
and
glanced
first
at
the
they
were
all
silk
hat
the
bowler
the
straw
so
he
was
in
and
within
each
hat
in
turn
she
seemed
to
see
her
husband
the
face
turned
away
from
distinctly
as
to
note
the
leathery
look
of
the
skin
of
his
cheek
and
neck
and
she
thought
i
pray
that
he
will
die
it
is
wicked
but
i
pray
that
he
will
die
then
quietly
that
he
might
not
hear
she
mounted
to
her
bedroom
the
door
into
his
was
open
and
she
went
to
shut
it
he
was
standing
there
at
the
window
ah
you
in
been
anywhere
to
the
national
it
was
the
first
direct
lie
she
had
ever
told
him
and
she
was
surprised
to
feel
neither
shame
nor
fear
but
rather
a
sense
of
pleasure
at
defeating
him
he
was
the
enemy
all
the
more
the
enemy
because
she
was
still
fighting
against
herself
and
so
strangely
in
his
behalf
alone
rather
boring
was
it
i
should
have
thought
you
have
got
young
lennan
to
take
you
why
by
instinct
she
had
seized
on
the
boldest
answer
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
told
from
her
face
if
he
were
her
superior
in
strength
he
was
her
inferior
in
quickness
he
lowered
his
eyes
and
said
his
line
is
it
with
a
shrug
she
turned
away
and
shut
the
door
she
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
very
still
in
that
little
passage
of
wits
she
had
won
she
could
win
in
many
such
but
the
full
hideousness
of
things
had
come
to
her
lies
lies
that
was
to
be
her
life
that
or
to
say
farewell
to
all
she
now
cared
for
to
cause
despair
not
only
in
herself
but
in
her
lover
what
in
order
that
her
body
might
remain
at
the
disposal
of
that
man
in
the
next
spirit
having
flown
from
him
for
ever
such
were
the
alternatives
unless
those
words
then
come
to
me
were
to
be
more
than
words
were
they
could
they
be
they
would
mean
such
happiness
his
love
for
her
were
more
than
a
summer
love
and
hers
for
him
was
than
summer
loves
how
know
and
without
knowing
how
give
such
pain
to
everyone
how
break
a
vow
she
had
thought
herself
quite
above
breaking
how
make
such
a
desperate
departure
from
all
the
traditions
and
beliefs
in
which
she
had
been
brought
up
but
in
the
very
nature
of
passion
is
that
which
resents
the
intrusion
of
hard
and
fast
decisions
and
suddenly
she
thought
if
our
love
can
not
stay
what
it
is
and
if
i
can
not
yet
go
to
him
for
always
is
there
not
still
another
way
she
got
up
and
began
to
dress
for
dinner
standing
before
her
glass
she
was
surprised
to
see
that
her
face
showed
no
signs
of
the
fears
and
doubts
that
were
now
her
comrades
was
it
because
whatever
happened
she
loved
and
was
beloved
she
wondered
how
she
had
looked
when
he
kissed
her
so
passionately
had
she
shown
her
joy
before
she
checked
him
in
her
garden
by
the
river
were
certain
flowers
that
for
all
her
care
would
grow
rank
and
of
the
wrong
a
different
soil
was
she
then
like
those
flowers
of
hers
ah
let
her
but
have
her
true
soil
and
she
would
grow
straight
and
true
enough
then
in
the
doorway
she
saw
her
husband
she
had
never
till
quite
hated
him
but
now
she
did
with
a
real
blind
horrible
feeling
what
did
he
want
of
her
standing
there
with
those
eyes
fixed
on
forceful
eyes
touched
with
blood
that
seemed
at
once
to
threaten
covet
and
beseech
she
drew
her
wrapper
close
round
her
shoulders
at
that
he
came
up
and
said
look
at
me
olive
against
instinct
and
will
she
obeyed
and
he
went
on
be
careful
i
say
be
careful
then
he
took
her
by
the
shoulders
and
raised
her
up
to
him
and
quite
unnerved
she
stood
without
resisting
i
want
you
he
said
i
mean
to
keep
then
suddenly
letting
her
go
he
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
that
frightened
her
was
so
unlike
him
not
till
now
had
she
understood
between
what
terrifying
forces
she
was
balancing
she
did
not
speak
but
her
face
grew
white
from
behind
those
hands
he
uttered
a
sound
not
quite
like
a
human
noise
turned
sharply
and
went
out
she
dropped
back
into
the
chair
before
her
mirror
overcome
by
the
most
singular
feeling
she
had
ever
known
as
if
she
had
lost
everything
even
her
love
for
lennan
and
her
longing
for
his
love
what
was
it
all
worth
what
was
anything
worth
in
a
world
like
this
all
was
loathsome
herself
loathsome
all
was
a
void
hateful
hateful
hateful
it
was
like
having
no
heart
at
all
and
that
same
evening
when
her
husband
had
gone
down
to
the
house
she
wrote
to
lennan
our
love
must
never
turn
to
earthiness
as
it
might
have
this
afternoon
everything
is
black
and
hopeless
he
suspects
for
you
to
come
here
is
impossible
and
too
dreadful
for
us
both
and
i
have
no
right
to
ask
you
to
be
furtive
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
you
like
that
and
i
ca
bear
it
myself
i
do
know
what
to
do
or

do
try
to
see

colonel
ercott
was
not
a
racing
man
but
he
had
in
common
with
others
of
his
countrymen
a
religious
feeling
in
the
matter
of
the
derby
his
remembrances
of
it
went
back
to
early
youth
for
he
had
been
born
and
brought
up
almost
within
sound
of
the
to
epsom
every
derby
and
oaks
day
he
had
gone
out
on
his
pony
to
watch
the
passing
of
the
tall
hats
and
feathers
of
the
great
and
the
and
feathers
of
the
lowly
and
afterwards
in
the
fields
at
home
had
ridden
races
with
old
lindsay
finishing
between
a
cow
that
judged
and
a
clump
of
bulrushes
representing
the
grand
stand
but
for
one
reason
or
another
he
had
never
seen
the
great
race
and
the
notion
that
it
was
his
duty
to
see
it
had
now
come
to
him
he
proposed
this
to
ercott
with
some
diffidence
she
read
so
many
did
not
quite
know
whether
she
would
approve
finding
that
she
did
he
added
casually
and
we
might
take
ercott
answered
dryly
you
know
the
house
of
commons
has
a
holiday
the
colonel
murmured
oh
i
do
want
that
chap
perhaps
said
ercott
you
would
like
mark
the
colonel
looked
at
her
most
dubiously
dolly
could
talk
of
it
as
a
tragedy
and
grand
passion
and
yet
make
a
suggestion
like
that
then
his
wrinkles
began
slowly
to
come
alive
and
he
gave
her
waist
a
squeeze
ercott
did
not
resist
that
treatment
take
olive
alone
she
said
i
do
really
care
to
when
the
colonel
went
to
fetch
his
niece
he
found
her
ready
and
very
he
asked
for
cramier
it
appeared
she
had
not
told
him
relieved
yet
somewhat
disconcerted
he
murmured
he
wo
mind
not
going
i
suppose
if
he
went
i
should
at
this
quiet
answer
the
colonel
was
beset
again
by
all
his
fears
he
put
his
white
down
and
took
her
hand
my
dear
he
said
i
do
want
to
intrude
upon
your
feelings
is
there
anything
i
can
do
it
dreadful
to
see
things
going
unhappily
with
you
he
felt
his
hand
being
lifted
her
face
pressed
against
it
and
suffering
acutely
with
his
other
hand
cased
in
a
bright
new
glove
he
smoothed
her
arm
we
have
a
jolly
good
day
sweetheart
he
said
and
forget
all
about
she
gave
the
hand
a
kiss
and
turned
away
and
the
colonel
vowed
to
himself
that
she
should
not
be
creature
that
she
was
so
delicate
and
straight
and
fine
in
her
pearly
frock
and
he
pulled
himself
together
brushing
his
white
vigorously
with
his
sleeve
forgetting
that
this
kind
of
hat
has
no
nap
and
so
he
was
tenderness
itself
on
the
journey
down
satisfying
all
her
wants
before
she
had
them
telling
her
stories
of
indian
life
and
consulting
her
carefully
as
to
which
horse
they
should
back
there
was
the
duke
of
course
but
there
was
another
animal
that
appealed
to
him
greatly
his
friend
tabor
had
given
him
the
who
had
the
best
arabs
in
all
at
a
nice
price
a
man
who
practically
never
gambled
the
colonel
liked
to
feel
that
his
fancy
would
bring
him
in
something
really
it
won
the
idea
that
it
could
lose
not
really
troubling
him
however
they
would
see
it
in
the
paddock
and
judge
for
themselves
the
paddock
was
the
place
away
from
all
the
dust
and
would
enjoy
the
paddock
once
on
the
course
they
neglected
the
first
race
it
was
more
important
the
colonel
thought
that
they
should
lunch
he
wanted
to
see
more
colour
in
her
cheeks
wanted
to
see
her
laugh
he
had
an
invitation
to
his
old
drag
where
the
champagne
was
sure
to
be
good
and
he
was
so
proud
of
not
have
missed
those
young
fellows
admiration
of
her
for
the
world
though
to
take
a
lady
amongst
them
was
in
fact
against
the
rules
it
was
not
then
till
the
second
race
was
due
to
start
that
they
made
their
way
into
the
paddock
here
the
derby
horses
were
being
led
solemnly
attended
each
by
a
little
posse
of
persons
looking
up
their
legs
and
down
their
ribs
to
see
whether
they
were
worthy
of
support
together
with
a
few
who
liked
to
see
a
whole
horse
at
a
time
presently
they
found
the
animal
which
had
been
recommended
to
the
colonel
it
was
a
chestnut
with
a
starred
forehead
parading
in
a
far
corner
the
colonel
who
really
loved
a
horse
was
deep
in
admiration
he
liked
its
head
and
he
liked
its
hocks
above
all
he
liked
its
eye
a
fine
creature
all
sense
and
just
a
little
straight
in
the
shoulder
for
coming
down
the
hill
and
in
the
midst
of
his
examination
he
found
himself
staring
at
his
niece
what
breeding
the
child
showed
with
her
delicate
arched
brows
little
ears
and
fine
close
nostrils
and
the
way
she
sure
and
springy
she
was
too
pretty
to
suffer
a
shame
if
she
had
been
so
pretty
that
young
fellow
would
have
fallen
in
love
with
her
if
she
were
so
husband
of
hers
and
the
colonel
dropped
his
gaze
startled
by
the
discovery
he
had
stumbled
on
if
she
had
been
so
pretty
was
that
the
meaning
of
it
all
the
cynicism
of
his
own
reflection
struck
him
between
wind
and
water
and
yet
something
in
himself
seemed
to
confirm
it
somehow
what
then
was
he
to
let
them
tear
her
in
two
between
them
destroying
her
because
she
was
so
pretty
and
somehow
this
discovery
of
passion
springs
from
worship
of
beauty
and
warmth
of
form
and
him
horribly
for
he
had
no
habit
of
philosophy
the
thought
seemed
to
him
strangely
crude
even
immoral
that
she
should
be
thus
between
two
ravening
bird
between
two
hawks
a
fruit
between
two
mouths
it
was
a
way
of
looking
at
things
that
had
never
before
occurred
to
him
the
idea
of
a
husband
clutching
at
his
wife
the
idea
of
that
young
man
who
looked
so
gentle
swooping
down
on
her
and
the
idea
that
if
she
faded
lost
her
looks
went
off
their
greed
indeed
any
man
would
die
these
horrible
ideas
hurt
him
the
more
for
the
remarkable
suddenness
with
which
they
had
come
to
him
a
tragic
business
dolly
had
said
so
queer
and
women
but
his
resolution
that
the
day
was
to
be
jolly
soon
recurred
to
him
and
he
hastily
resumed
inspection
of
his
fancy
perhaps
they
ought
to
have
a
note
on
it
and
they
had
better
get
back
to
the
stand
and
as
they
went
the
colonel
saw
standing
beneath
a
tree
at
a
little
distance
a
young
man
that
he
could
have
sworn
was
lennan
not
likely
for
an
artist
chap
to
be
down
here
but
it
was
undoubtedly
young
lennan
in
a
fortunately
however
his
face
was
not
turned
in
their
direction
he
said
nothing
to
olive
not
after
those
unpleasant
take
responsibility
and
he
kept
her
moving
towards
the
gate
congratulating
himself
that
his
eyes
had
been
so
sharp
in
the
crush
there
he
was
separated
from
her
a
little
but
she
was
soon
beside
him
again
and
more
than
ever
he
congratulated
himself
that
nothing
had
occurred
to
upset
her
and
spoil
the
day
her
cheeks
were
warm
enough
now
her
dark
eyes
glowing
she
was
excited
no
doubt
by
thoughts
of
the
race
and
of
the
he
was
going
to
put
on
for
her
he
recounted
the
matter
afterwards
to
ercott
that
chestnut
tabor
put
me
on
to
finished
get
down
the
it
would
the
moment
i
set
eyes
on
it
but
the
child
enjoyed
herself
wish
you
been
there
my
dear
of
his
deeper
thoughts
and
of
that
glimpse
of
young
lennan
he
did
not
speak
for
on
the
way
home
an
ugly
suspicion
had
attacked
him
had
the
young
fellow
after
all
seen
and
managed
to
get
close
to
her
in
the
crush
at
the
paddock
gateway
xiv
that
letter
of
hers
fanned
the
flame
in
lennan
as
nothing
had
yet
fanned
it
earthiness
was
it
earthiness
to
love
as
he
did
if
so
then
not
for
all
the
world
would
he
be
otherwise
than
earthy
in
the
shock
of
reading
it
he
crossed
his
rubicon
and
burned
his
boats
behind
him
no
more
did
the
pale
ghost
chivalrous
devotion
haunt
him
he
knew
now
that
he
could
not
stop
short
since
she
asked
him
he
must
not
of
course
try
to
see
her
just
yet
but
when
he
did
then
he
would
fight
for
his
life
the
thought
that
she
might
be
meaning
to
slip
away
from
him
was
too
utterly
unbearable
but
she
could
not
be
meaning
that
she
would
never
be
so
cruel
ah
she
must
come
to
him
in
the
end
the
world
life
itself
would
be
well
lost
for
love
of
her
thus
resolved
he
was
even
able
to
work
again
and
all
that
tuesday
he
modelled
at
a
big
version
of
the
fantastic
figure
he
had
conceived
after
the
colonel
left
him
up
on
the
hillside
at
beaulieu
he
worked
at
it
with
a
sort
of
evil
joy
into
this
creature
he
would
put
the
spirit
of
possession
that
held
her
from
him
and
while
his
fingers
forced
the
clay
he
felt
as
if
he
had
cramier
neck
within
his
grip
yet
now
that
he
had
resolved
to
take
her
if
he
could
he
had
not
quite
the
same
hatred
after
all
this
man
loved
her
too
could
not
help
it
that
she
loathed
him
could
not
help
it
that
he
had
the
disposition
of
her
body
and
soul
june
had
come
in
with
skies
of
a
blue
that
not
even
london
glare
and
dust
could
pale
in
every
square
and
park
and
patch
of
green
the
air
simmered
with
life
and
with
the
music
of
birds
swaying
on
little
boughs
piano
organs
in
the
streets
were
no
longer
wistful
for
the
south
lovers
already
sat
in
the
shade
of
trees
to
remain
indoors
when
he
was
not
working
was
sheer
torture
for
he
could
not
read
and
had
lost
all
interest
in
the
little
excitements
amusements
occupations
that
go
to
make
up
the
normal
life
of
man
every
outer
thing
seemed
to
have
dropped
off
shrivelled
leaving
him
just
a
condition
of
the
spirit
a
state
of
mind
lying
awake
he
would
think
of
things
in
the
past
and
they
would
mean
dissolved
and
dispersed
by
the
heat
of
this
feeling
in
him
indeed
his
sense
of
isolation
was
so
strong
that
he
could
not
even
believe
that
he
had
lived
through
the
facts
which
his
memory
apprehended
he
had
become
one
burning
and
nothing
more
to
be
out
especially
amongst
trees
was
the
only
solace
and
he
sat
for
a
long
time
that
evening
under
a
large
on
a
knoll
above
the
serpentine
there
was
very
little
breeze
just
enough
to
keep
alive
a
kind
of
whispering
what
if
men
and
women
when
they
had
lived
their
gusty
lives
became
trees
what
if
someone
who
had
burned
and
ached
were
now
spreading
over
him
this
leafy
shadow
against
the
stars
or
were
the
stars
perhaps
the
souls
of
men
and
women
escaped
for
ever
from
love
and
longing
he
broke
off
a
branch
of
the
lime
and
drew
it
across
his
face
it
was
not
yet
in
flower
but
it
smelled
lemony
and
fresh
even
here
in
london
if
only
for
a
moment
he
could
desert
his
own
heart
and
rest
with
the
trees
and
stars
no
further
letter
came
from
her
next
morning
and
he
soon
lost
his
power
to
work
it
was
derby
day
he
determined
to
go
down
perhaps
she
would
be
there
even
if
she
were
not
he
might
find
some
little
distraction
in
the
crowd
and
the
horses
he
had
seen
her
in
the
paddock
long
before
the
colonel
sharp
eyes
detected
him
and
following
in
the
crush
managed
to
touch
her
hand
in
the
crowded
gateway
and
whisper
the
national
gallery
at
four
the
bacchus
and
ariadne
for
sake
her
gloved
hand
pressed
his
hard
and
she
was
gone
he
stayed
in
the
paddock
too
happy
almost
to
breathe
next
day
while
waiting
before
that
picture
he
looked
at
it
with
wonder
for
there
seemed
his
own
passion
transfigured
in
the
darkening
sky
and
the
eyes
of
the
leaping
god
in
spirit
was
he
not
always
rushing
to
her
like
that
minutes
passed
and
she
did
not
come
what
should
he
do
if
she
failed
him
surely
die
of
disappointment
and
despair
he
had
little
enough
experience
as
yet
of
the
toughness
of
the
human
heart
how
life
bruises
and
crushes
yet
leaves
it
beating
then
from
an
unlikely
quarter
he
saw
her
coming
they
walked
in
silence
down
to
the
quiet
rooms
where
the
turner
watercolours
hung
no
one
save
two
frenchmen
and
an
old
official
watched
them
passing
slowly
before
those
little
pictures
till
they
came
to
the
end
wall
and
unseen
unheard
by
any
but
her
he
could
begin
the
arguments
he
had
so
carefully
rehearsed
were
all
forgotten
nothing
left
but
an
incoherent
pleading
life
without
her
was
not
life
and
they
had
only
one
life
for
summer
it
was
all
dark
where
she
was
very
sun
itself
was
dark
better
to
die
than
to
live
such
false
broken
lives
apart
from
each
other
better
to
die
at
once
than
to
live
wanting
each
other
longing
and
longing
and
watching
each
sorrow
and
all
for
the
sake
of
what
it
maddened
killed
him
to
think
of
that
man
touching
her
when
he
knew
she
did
but
hate
him
it
shamed
all
manhood
it
could
not
be
good
to
help
such
things
to
be
a
vow
when
the
spirit
of
it
was
gone
was
only
superstition
it
was
wicked
to
waste
one
life
for
the
sake
of
that
knew
she
must
cared
for
the
forms
the
outsides
of
things
and
what
did
it
matter
what
society
thought
it
had
no
soul
no
feeling
nothing
and
if
it
were
said
they
ought
to
sacrifice
themselves
for
the
sake
of
others
to
make
things
happier
in
the
world
she
must
know
that
was
only
true
when
love
was
light
and
selfish
but
not
when
people
loved
as
they
did
with
all
their
hearts
and
souls
so
that
they
would
die
for
each
other
any
minute
so
that
without
each
other
there
was
no
meaning
in
anything
it
would
not
help
a
single
soul
for
them
to
murder
their
love
and
all
the
happiness
of
their
lives
to
go
on
in
a
sort
of
living
death
even
if
it
were
wrong
he
would
rather
do
that
wrong
and
take
the
consequences
but
it
was
not
it
could
not
be
wrong
when
they
felt
like
that
and
all
the
time
that
he
was
pouring
forth
those
supplications
his
eyes
searched
and
searched
her
face
but
there
only
came
from
her
i
ca
only
i
knew
and
then
he
was
silent
stricken
to
the
heart
till
at
a
look
or
a
touch
from
her
he
would
break
out
again
you
do
love
do
then
what
does
anything
else
matter
and
so
it
went
on
and
on
that
summer
afternoon
in
the
deserted
room
meant
for
such
other
things
where
the
two
frenchmen
were
too
sympathetic
and
the
old
official
too
drowsy
to
come
then
it
all
narrowed
to
one
fierce
insistent
question
what
is
is
it
you
afraid
of
but
to
that
too
he
got
only
the
one
mournful
answer
paralyzing
in
its
fateful
monotony
i
do
ca
tell
it
was
awful
to
go
on
thus
beating
against
this
uncanny
dark
shadowy
resistance
these
unreal
doubts
and
dreads
that
by
their
very
dumbness
were
becoming
real
to
him
too
if
only
she
could
tell
him
what
she
feared
it
could
not
be
was
not
like
he
had
enough
for
both
it
could
not
be
loss
of
a
social
position
which
was
but
irksome
to
her
surely
it
was
not
fear
that
he
would
cease
to
love
her
what
was
it
in
god
had
told
was
to
go
down
alone
to
the
would
she
not
come
now
this
very
minute
to
him
instead
and
they
would
start
night
back
to
the
south
where
their
love
had
flowered
but
again
it
was
i
ca
i
do
must
have
time
and
yet
her
eyes
had
that
brooding
how
could
she
hold
back
and
waver
but
utterly
exhausted
he
did
not
plead
again
did
not
even
resist
when
she
said
you
must
go
now
and
leave
me
to
get
back
i
will
write
shall
he
begged
for
and
took
one
kiss
then
passing
the
old
official
went
quickly
up
and
out
xv
he
reached
his
rooms
overcome
by
a
lassitude
that
was
not
however
quite
despair
he
had
made
his
effort
there
was
still
within
him
the
unconquerable
hope
of
the
passionate
lover
as
well
try
to
extinguish
in
full
june
the
beating
of
the
heart
of
summer
deny
to
the
flowers
their
deepening
hues
or
to
winged
life
its
slumbrous
buzzing
as
stifle
in
such
a
lover
his
conviction
of
fulfilment
he
lay
down
on
a
couch
and
there
stayed
a
long
time
quite
still
his
forehead
pressed
against
the
wall
his
will
was
already
beginning
to
recover
for
a
fresh
attempt
it
was
merciful
that
she
was
going
away
from
cramier
going
to
where
he
had
in
fancy
watched
her
feed
her
doves
no
laws
no
fears
not
even
her
commands
could
stop
his
fancy
from
conjuring
her
up
by
day
and
night
he
had
but
to
close
his
eyes
and
she
was
there
a
ring
at
the
bell
repeated
several
times
roused
him
at
last
to
go
to
the
door
his
caller
was
robert
cramier
and
at
sight
of
him
all
lennan
lethargy
gave
place
to
a
steely
feeling
what
had
brought
him
here
had
he
been
spying
on
his
wife
the
old
longing
for
physical
combat
came
over
him
cramier
was
perhaps
fifteen
years
his
senior
but
taller
heavier
thicker
chances
then
were
pretty
equal
wo
you
come
in
he
said
the
voice
had
in
it
the
same
mockery
as
on
sunday
and
it
shot
through
him
that
cramier
had
thought
to
find
his
wife
here
if
so
he
did
not
betray
it
by
any
crude
look
round
he
came
in
with
his
deliberate
step
light
and
for
so
big
a
man
so
this
he
said
is
where
you
produce
your
masterpieces
anything
great
since
you
came
back
lennan
lifted
the
cloths
from
the
figure
of
his
he
felt
malicious
pleasure
in
doing
that
would
cramier
recognize
himself
in
this
creature
with
the
ears
and
great
bossed
forehead
if
this
man
who
had
her
happiness
beneath
his
heel
had
come
here
to
mock
he
should
at
all
events
get
what
he
had
come
to
give
and
he
waited
i
see
you
are
giving
the
poor
brute
horns
if
cramier
had
seen
he
had
dared
to
add
a
touch
of
cynical
humour
which
the
sculptor
himself
had
never
thought
of
and
this
even
evoked
in
the
young
man
a
kind
of
admiring
compunction
those
are
not
horns
he
said
gently
only
cramier
lifted
a
hand
and
touched
the
edge
of
his
own
ear
not
quite
like
that
are
ears
but
i
suppose
you
would
call
this
symbolic
what
if
i
may
ask
does
it
represent
all
the
softness
in
lennan
vanished
if
you
ca
gather
that
from
looking
it
must
be
a
not
at
all
if
i
am
right
you
want
something
for
it
to
tread
on
you
to
get
your
full
effect
lennan
touched
the
base
of
the
clay
the
broken
curve
here
with
sudden
disgust
at
this
fencing
was
silent
what
had
the
man
come
for
he
must
want
something
and
as
if
answering
cramier
said
to
pass
to
another
see
a
good
deal
of
my
wife
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
do
very
much
care
that
you
should
it
is
as
well
to
be
quite
frank
i
lennan
bowed
is
that
not
he
said
perhaps
rather
a
matter
for
her
decision
that
heavy
threatening
eyes
the
whole
thing
was
like
a
dream
come
true
i
do
not
feel
it
so
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
let
things
drift
please
understand
me
you
come
between
us
at
your
lennan
kept
silence
for
a
moment
then
he
said
quietly
can
one
come
between
two
people
who
have
ceased
to
have
anything
in
common
the
veins
in
cramier
forehead
were
swollen
his
face
and
neck
had
grown
crimson
and
lennan
thought
with
strange
elation
now
he
going
to
hit
me
he
could
hardly
keep
his
hands
from
shooting
out
and
seizing
in
advance
that
great
strong
neck
if
he
could
strangle
and
have
done
with
him
but
quite
suddenly
cramier
turned
on
his
heel
i
have
warned
you
he
said
and
went
lennan
took
a
long
breath
so
that
was
over
and
he
knew
where
he
was
if
cramier
had
struck
out
he
would
surely
have
seized
his
neck
and
held
on
till
life
was
gone
nothing
should
have
shaken
him
off
in
fancy
he
could
see
himself
swaying
writhing
reeling
battered
about
by
those
heavy
fists
but
always
with
his
hands
on
the
thick
neck
squeezing
out
its
life
he
could
feel
absolutely
feel
the
last
reel
and
stagger
of
that
great
bulk
crashing
down
dragging
him
with
it
till
it
lay
upturned
still
he
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
thank
god
the
fellow
had
not
hit
out
he
went
to
the
door
opened
it
and
stood
leaning
against
the
all
was
still
and
drowsy
out
there
in
that
quiet
backwater
of
a
street
not
a
soul
in
sight
how
still
for
london
only
the
birds
in
a
neighbouring
studio
someone
was
playing
chopin
queer
he
had
almost
forgotten
there
was
such
a
thing
as
chopin
a
mazurka
spinning
like
some
top
thing
round

well
and
what
now
only
one
thing
certain
sooner
give
up
life
than
give
her
up
far
sooner

give
up

going
on
and
on

little
dancing
dirge
of
summer
xvi
at
her
cottage
olive
stood
often
by
the
river
what
lay
beneath
all
that
bright
strange
deep
swaying
life
so
far
below
the
ruffling
of
wind
and
the
shadows
of
the
willow
trees
was
love
down
there
too
love
between
sentient
things
where
it
was
almost
dark
or
had
all
passion
climbed
up
to
rustle
with
the
reeds
and
float
with
the
in
the
sunlight
was
there
colour
or
had
colour
been
drowned
no
scent
and
no
music
but
movement
there
would
be
for
all
the
dim
groping
things
bending
one
way
to
the
no
less
than
in
the
never
quite
still
and
the
winged
droves
of
the
clouds
and
if
it
were
dark
down
there
it
was
dark
too
above
the
water
and
hearts
ached
and
eyes
just
as
much
searched
for
that
which
did
not
come
to
watch
it
always
flowing
by
to
the
sea
never
looking
back
never
swaying
this
way
or
that
drifting
along
quiet
as
or
glamorous
with
the
gold
and
moonlight
of
these
beautiful
days
and
nights
when
every
flower
in
her
garden
in
the
fields
and
along
the
river
banks
was
full
of
sweet
life
when
starred
the
lanes
and
in
the
wood
the
bracken
was
nearly
a
foot
high
she
was
not
alone
there
though
she
would
much
rather
have
been
two
days
after
she
left
london
her
uncle
and
aunt
had
joined
her
it
was
from
cramier
they
had
received
their
invitation
he
himself
had
not
yet
been
down
every
night
having
parted
from
ercott
and
gone
up
the
wide
shallow
stairs
to
her
room
she
would
sit
down
at
the
window
to
write
to
lennan
one
candle
beside
pale
flame
for
comrade
as
it
might
be
his
spirit
every
evening
she
poured
out
to
him
her
thoughts
and
ended
always
have
patience
she
was
still
waiting
for
courage
to
pass
that
dark
hedge
of
impalpable
doubts
and
fears
and
scruples
of
a
dread
that
she
could
not
make
articulate
even
to
herself
having
finished
she
would
lean
out
into
the
night
the
colonel
his
black
figure
cloaked
against
the
dew
would
be
pacing
up
and
down
the
lawn
with
his
cigar
whose
fiery
spark
she
could
just
discern
and
beyond
her
ghostly
and
beyond
the
then
she
would
clasp
herself
to
stretch
out
her
arms
lest
she
should
be
seen
each
morning
she
rose
early
dressed
and
slipped
away
to
the
village
to
post
her
letter
from
the
woods
across
the
river
wild
pigeons
would
be
though
love
itself
pleaded
with
her
afresh
each
day
she
was
back
well
before
breakfast
to
go
up
to
her
room
and
come
down
again
as
if
for
the
first
time
the
colonel
meeting
her
on
the
stairs
or
in
the
hall
would
say
ah
my
dear
just
beaten
you
slept
well
and
while
her
lips
touched
his
cheek
slanted
at
the
proper
angle
for
uncles
he
never
dreamed
that
she
had
been
three
miles
already
through
the
dew
now
that
she
was
in
the
throes
of
an
indecision
whose
ending
one
way
or
the
other
must
be
so
tremendous
now
that
she
was
in
the
very
swirl
she
let
no
sign
at
all
escape
her
the
colonel
and
even
his
wife
were
deceived
into
thinking
that
after
all
no
great
harm
had
been
done
it
was
grateful
to
them
to
think
so
because
of
that
stewardship
at
monte
carlo
of
which
they
could
not
render
too
good
account
the
warm
sleepy
days
with
a
little
croquet
and
a
little
paddling
on
the
river
and
much
sitting
out
of
doors
when
the
colonel
would
read
aloud
from
tennyson
were
very
pleasant
to
not
to
was
especially
jolly
to
be
out
of
town
confounded
crowded
time
of
year
and
so
the
days
of
early
june
went
by
each
finer
than
the
last
and
then
cramier
came
down
without
warning
on
a
friday
evening
it
was
hot
in
london
the
session
dull
the
jubilee
turning
everything
upside
down
they
were
lucky
to
be
out
of
town
a
silent
ercott
noticed
that
he
drank
wine
like
water
and
for
minutes
at
a
time
fixed
his
eyes
that
looked
heavy
as
if
he
had
not
been
sleeping
not
on
his
wife
face
but
on
her
neck
if
olive
really
disliked
and
feared
john
would
have
disguised
her
feelings
very
well
for
so
pale
a
woman
she
was
looking
brilliant
that
night
the
sun
had
caught
her
cheeks
perhaps
that
black
frock
suited
her
with
old
lace
matching
her
skin
so
well
and
one
carnation
of
darkest
red
at
her
breast
her
eyes
were
really
sometimes
like
black
velvet
it
suited
pale
women
to
have
those
eyes
that
looked
so
black
at
night
she
was
talking
too
and
laughing
more
than
usual
one
would
have
said
a
wife
delighted
to
welcome
her
husband
and
yet
there
was
in
the
air
in
the
feel
of
lowering
fixity
of
that
man
eyes
coming
after
all
this
heat
surely
the
night
was
unnaturally
still
and
dark
hardly
a
breath
of
air
and
so
many
moths
out
there
passing
the
beam
of
light
like
little
pale
spirits
crossing
a
river
ercott
smiled
pleased
at
that
image
moths
men
were
like
moths
there
were
women
from
whom
they
could
not
keep
away
yes
there
was
something
about
olive
that
drew
men
to
her
not
do
her
justice
not
that
at
all
but
something
soft
like
one
of
these
to
the
poor
moths
eyes
were
never
quite
as
she
knew
them
when
he
was
looking
at
olive
and
robert
a
queer
drugged
look
they
had
as
for
that
other
poor
young
had
never
forgotten
his
face
when
they
came
on
him
in
the
park
and
when
after
dinner
they
sat
on
the
veranda
they
were
all
more
silent
still
just
watching
it
seemed
the
smoke
of
their
cigarettes
rising
quite
straight
as
though
wind
had
been
withdrawn
from
the
world
the
colonel
twice
endeavoured
to
speak
about
the
moon
it
ought
to
be
up
by
now
it
was
going
to
be
full
and
then
cramier
said
put
on
that
scarf
thing
olive
and
come
round
the
garden
with
ercott
admitted
to
herself
now
that
what
john
said
was
true
just
one
gleam
of
eyes
turned
quickly
this
way
and
that
as
a
bird
looks
for
escape
and
then
olive
had
got
up
and
quietly
gone
with
him
down
the
path
till
their
silent
figures
were
lost
to
sight
disturbed
to
the
heart
ercott
rose
and
went
over
to
her
chair
he
was
frowning
and
staring
at
his
evening
shoe
balanced
on
a
single
toe
he
looked
up
at
her
and
put
out
his
hand
ercott
gave
it
a
squeeze
she
wanted
comfort
the
colonel
spoke
it
heavy
dolly
i
do
like
the
feel
of
xvii
they
had
passed
without
a
single
word
spoken
down
through
the
laurels
and
guelder
roses
to
the
river
bank
then
he
had
turned
to
the
right
and
gone
along
it
under
the
to
the
there
he
had
stopped
in
the
pitch
darkness
of
that
foliage
it
seemed
to
her
dreadfully
still
if
only
there
had
been
the
faintest
breeze
the
faintest
lisping
of
reeds
on
the
water
one
bird
to
make
a
sound
but
nothing
nothing
save
his
breathing
deep
irregular
with
a
quiver
in
it
what
had
he
brought
her
here
for
to
show
her
how
utterly
she
was
his
was
he
never
going
to
speak
never
going
to
say
whatever
it
was
he
had
in
mind
to
say
if
only
he
would
not
touch
her
then
he
moved
and
a
stone
dislodged
fell
with
a
splash
into
the
water
she
could
not
help
a
little
gasp
how
black
the
river
looked
but
slowly
beyond
the
dim
shape
of
the
giant
poplar
a
shiver
of
light
stole
outwards
across
the
blackness
from
the
far
moon
whose
rim
she
could
now
see
rising
of
a
thick
gold
like
a
coin
above
the
woods
her
heart
went
out
to
that
warm
light
at
all
events
there
was
one
friendly
inhabitant
of
this
darkness
suddenly
she
felt
his
hands
on
her
waist
she
did
not
move
her
heart
beat
too
furiously
but
a
sort
of
prayer
fluttered
up
from
it
against
her
lips
in
the
grip
of
those
heavy
hands
was
such
quivering
force
his
voice
sounded
very
husky
and
strange
olive
this
ca
go
on
i
suffer
my
god
i
suffer
a
pang
went
through
her
a
sort
of
surprise
suffer
she
might
wish
him
dead
but
she
did
not
want
him
to
knew
and
yet
gripped
by
those
hands
she
could
not
say
i
am
sorry
he
made
a
sound
that
was
almost
a
groan
and
dropped
on
his
knees
feeling
herself
held
fast
she
tried
to
push
his
forehead
back
from
her
waist
it
was
fiery
hot
and
she
heard
him
mutter
have
mercy
love
me
a
little
but
the
clutch
of
his
hands
never
still
on
the
thin
silk
of
her
dress
turned
her
faint
she
tried
to
writhe
away
but
could
not
stood
still
again
and
at
last
found
her
voice
mercy
can
i
make
myself
love
no
one
ever
could
since
the
world
began
please
please
get
up
let
me
go
but
he
was
pulling
her
down
to
him
so
that
she
was
forced
on
to
her
knees
on
the
grass
with
her
face
close
to
his
a
low
moaning
was
coming
from
him
it
was
horrible
and
he
went
on
pleading
the
words
all
confused
not
looking
in
her
face
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
would
never
end
that
she
would
never
get
free
of
that
grip
away
from
that
stammering
whispering
voice
she
stayed
by
instinct
utterly
still
closing
her
eyes
then
she
felt
his
gaze
for
the
first
time
that
evening
on
her
face
and
realized
that
he
had
not
dared
to
look
until
her
eyes
were
closed
for
fear
of
reading
what
was
in
them
she
said
very
gently
please
let
me
go
i
think
i
going
to
he
relaxed
the
grip
of
his
arms
she
sank
down
and
stayed
unmoving
on
the
grass
after
such
utter
stillness
that
she
hardly
knew
whether
he
were
there
or
not
she
felt
his
hot
hand
on
her
bare
shoulder
was
it
all
to
begin
again
she
shrank
down
lower
still
and
a
little
moan
escaped
her
he
let
her
go
suddenly
and
when
at
last
she
looked
up
was
gone
she
got
to
her
feet
trembling
and
moved
quickly
from
under
the
she
tried
to
to
understand
exactly
what
this
portended
for
her
for
him
for
her
lover
but
she
could
not
there
was
around
her
thoughts
the
same
breathless
darkness
that
brooded
over
this
night
ah
but
to
the
night
had
been
given
that
to
herself
nothing
no
faintest
gleam
as
well
try
to
pierce
below
the
dark
surface
of
that
water
she
passed
her
hands
over
her
face
and
hair
and
dress
how
long
had
it
lasted
how
long
had
they
been
out
here
and
she
began
slowly
moving
back
towards
the
house
thank
god
she
had
not
yielded
to
fear
or
pity
not
uttered
falsities
not
pretended
she
could
love
him
and
betrayed
her
heart
that
would
have
been
the
one
unbearable
thing
to
have
been
left
remembering
she
stood
long
looking
down
as
if
trying
to
see
the
future
in
her
dim
then
bracing
herself
hurried
to
the
house
no
one
was
on
the
veranda
no
one
in
the
she
looked
at
the
clock
nearly
eleven
ringing
for
the
servant
to
shut
the
windows
she
stole
up
to
her
room
had
her
husband
gone
away
as
he
had
come
or
would
she
presently
again
be
face
to
face
with
that
dread
the
nerve
of
which
never
stopped
aching
now
dread
of
the
night
when
he
was
near
she
determined
not
to
go
to
bed
and
drawing
a
long
chair
to
the
window
wrapped
herself
in
a
gown
and
lay
back
the
flower
from
her
dress
miraculously
uncrushed
in
those
dark
minutes
on
the
grass
she
set
in
water
beside
her
at
the
favourite
flower
he
had
once
told
her
it
was
a
comfort
with
its
scent
and
hue
and
memory
of
him
strange
that
in
her
life
with
all
the
faces
seen
and
people
known
she
had
not
loved
one
till
she
had
met
lennan
she
had
even
been
sure
that
love
would
never
come
to
her
had
not
wanted
much
had
thought
to
go
on
well
enough
and
pass
out
at
the
end
never
having
known
or
much
cared
to
know
full
summer
love
had
taken
its
revenge
on
her
now
for
all
slighted
love
offered
her
in
the
past
for
the
one
hated
love
that
had
been
on
its
knees
to
her
they
said
it
must
always
come
once
to
every
man
and
witchery
this
dark
sweet
feeling
springing
up
who
knew
how
or
why
she
had
not
believed
but
now
she
knew
and
whatever
might
be
coming
she
would
not
have
this
different
since
all
things
changed
she
must
change
and
get
old
and
be
no
longer
pretty
for
him
to
look
at
but
this
in
her
heart
could
not
change
she
felt
sure
of
that
it
was
as
if
something
said
this
is
for
ever
beyond
life
beyond
death
this
is
for
ever
he
will
be
dust
and
you
dust
but
your
love
will
live
the
woods
among
the
flowers
or
down
in
the
dark
water
it
will
haunt
for
it
only
you
have
lived
then
she
noticed
that
a
slender
thing
unlike
any
moth
she
had
ever
seen
had
settled
on
her
gown
close
to
her
neck
it
seemed
to
be
sleeping
so
delicate
and
drowsy
having
come
in
from
the
breathless
dark
thinking
perhaps
that
her
whiteness
was
a
light
what
dim
memory
did
it
rouse
something
of
him
something
he
had
darkness
on
a
night
like
this
ah
yes
that
evening
after
gorbio
the
little
on
her
knee
he
had
touched
her
when
he
took
that
cosy
wan
thing
off
her
she
leaned
out
for
air
what
a
night
stars
were
hiding
in
the
sheer
heavy
warmth
whose
small
round
golden
moon
had
no
transparency
a
night
like
a
black
pansy
with
a
little
gold
heart
and
silent
for
of
the
trees
that
whispered
so
much
at
night
not
even
the
aspens
had
voice
the
unstirring
air
had
a
against
her
cheeks
but
in
all
the
stillness
what
sentiency
what
in
her
heart
could
she
not
draw
him
to
her
from
those
woods
from
that
dark
gleaming
river
draw
him
from
the
flowers
and
trees
and
the
of
the
him
up
to
her
waiting
here
so
that
she
was
no
more
this
craving
creature
but
one
with
him
and
the
night
and
she
let
her
head
droop
down
on
her
hands
all
night
long
she
stayed
there
at
the
window
sometimes
dozing
in
the
chair
once
waking
with
a
start
fancying
that
her
husband
was
bending
over
her
had
he
stolen
away
and
the
dawn
came
filmy
and
wistful
woven
round
each
black
tree
and
round
the
white
and
falling
along
the
river
and
the
chirrupings
of
birds
stirred
among
leaves
as
yet
invisible
she
slept
then
xviii
when
she
awoke
once
more
in
daylight
smiling
cramier
was
standing
beside
her
chair
his
face
all
dark
and
bitter
had
the
sodden
look
of
a
man
very
tired
so
he
said
sleeping
this
way
does
spoil
your
dreams
do
let
me
disturb
them
i
am
just
going
back
to
like
a
frightened
bird
she
stayed
not
stirring
gazing
at
his
back
as
he
leaned
in
the
window
till
turning
round
on
her
again
he
said
but
remember
this
what
i
ca
have
no
one
else
shall
do
you
understand
no
one
else
and
he
bent
down
close
repeating
do
you
bad
wife
four
years
submission
to
a
touch
she
shrank
from
one
long
effort
not
to
shrink
bad
wife
not
if
he
killed
her
would
she
answer
now
do
you
hear
he
said
once
more
make
up
your
mind
to
that
i
mean
he
had
gripped
the
arms
of
her
chair
till
she
could
feel
it
quiver
beneath
her
would
he
drive
his
fist
into
her
face
that
she
managed
to
keep
still
smiling
but
there
only
passed
into
his
eyes
an
expression
which
she
could
not
read
well
he
said
you
know
and
walked
heavily
towards
the
door
the
moment
he
had
gone
she
sprang
up
yes
she
was
a
bad
wife
a
wife
who
had
reached
the
end
of
her
tether
a
wife
who
hated
instead
of
loving
a
wife
in
prison
bad
wife
martyrdom
then
for
the
sake
of
a
faith
in
her
that
was
lost
already
could
be
but
folly
if
she
seemed
bad
and
false
to
him
there
was
no
longer
reason
to
pretend
to
be
otherwise
no
longer
would
she
in
the
words
of
the
old
song
and
bracken
pulling
bracken
no
more
would
she
starve
for
want
of
love
and
watch
the
nights
throb
and
ache
as
last
night
had
throbbed
and
ached
with
the
passion
that
she
might
not
satisfy
and
while
she
was
dressing
she
wondered
why
she
did
not
look
tired
to
get
out
quickly
to
send
her
lover
word
at
once
to
hasten
to
her
while
it
was
she
might
tell
him
she
was
coming
to
him
out
of
prison
she
would
telegraph
for
him
to
come
that
evening
with
a
boat
opposite
the
tall
poplar
she
and
her
aunt
and
uncle
were
to
go
to
dinner
at
the
rectory
but
she
would
plead
headache
at
the
last
minute
when
the
ercotts
had
gone
she
would
slip
out
and
he
and
she
would
row
over
to
the
wood
and
be
together
for
two
hours
of
happiness
and
they
must
make
a
clear
plan
they
would
begin
their
life
together
but
it
would
not
be
safe
to
send
that
message
from
the
village
she
must
go
down
and
over
the
bridge
to
the
on
the
other
side
where
they
did
not
know
her
it
was
too
late
now
before
breakfast
better
after
when
she
could
slip
away
knowing
for
certain
that
her
husband
had
gone
it
would
still
not
be
too
late
for
her
never
left
his
rooms
till
the
midday
post
which
brought
her
letters
she
finished
dressing
and
knowing
that
she
must
show
no
trace
of
her
excitement
sat
quite
still
for
several
minutes
forcing
herself
into
languor
then
she
went
down
her
husband
had
breakfasted
and
gone
at
everything
she
did
and
every
word
she
spoke
she
was
now
smiling
with
a
sort
of
wonder
as
if
she
were
watching
a
self
that
she
had
abandoned
like
an
old
garment
perform
for
her
amusement
it
even
gave
her
no
feeling
of
remorse
to
think
she
was
going
to
do
what
would
be
so
painful
to
the
good
colonel
he
was
dear
to
it
did
not
matter
she
was
past
all
that
nothing
in
the
world
it
amused
her
to
believe
that
her
uncle
and
aunt
misread
her
last
night
walk
in
the
dark
garden
misread
her
languor
and
serenity
and
at
the
first
moment
possible
she
flew
out
and
slipped
away
under
cover
of
the
towards
the
river
passing
the
spot
where
her
husband
had
dragged
her
down
to
him
on
her
knees
in
the
grass
she
felt
a
sort
of
surprise
that
she
could
ever
have
been
so
terrified
what
was
he
the
and
she
flew
on
she
noted
carefully
the
river
bank
opposite
the
tall
poplar
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
get
down
from
there
into
a
boat
but
they
would
not
stay
in
that
dark
backwater
they
would
go
over
to
the
far
side
into
those
woods
from
which
last
night
the
moon
had
risen
those
woods
from
which
the
pigeons
mocked
her
every
morning
those
woods
so
full
of
summer
coming
back
no
one
would
see
her
landing
for
it
would
be
pitch
dark
in
the
backwater
and
while
she
hurried
she
looked
back
across
her
shoulder
marking
where
the
water
entering
ceased
to
be
bright
a
brushed
her
cheek
she
saw
it
vanish
where
the
sunlight
failed
how
suddenly
its
happy
flight
was
quenched
in
that
dark
shade
as
a
candle
flame
blown
out
the
tree
growth
there
was
too
queer
stumps
and
snags
had
uncanny
shapes
as
of
monstrous
creatures
whose
eyes
seemed
to
peer
out
at
you
she
shivered
she
had
seen
those
monsters
with
their
peering
eyes
somewhere
ah
in
her
dream
at
monte
carlo
of
that
staring
from
the
banks
while
she
drifted
by
unable
to
cry
out
no
the
backwater
was
not
a
happy
would
not
stay
there
a
single
minute
and
more
swiftly
than
ever
she
flew
on
along
the
path
soon
she
had
crossed
the
bridge
sent
off
her
message
and
returned
but
there
were
ten
hours
to
get
through
before
eight
and
she
did
not
hurry
now
she
wanted
this
day
of
summer
to
herself
alone
a
day
of
dreaming
till
he
came
this
day
for
which
all
her
life
till
now
had
been
shaping
day
of
love
fate
was
very
wonderful
if
she
had
ever
loved
before
if
she
had
known
joy
in
her
could
never
have
been
feeling
what
she
was
feeling
now
what
she
well
knew
she
would
never
feel
again
she
crossed
a
hayfield
and
finding
a
bank
threw
herself
down
on
her
back
among
its
uncut
grasses
far
away
at
the
other
end
men
were
scything
it
was
all
very
soft
clouds
floating
the
pushing
themselves
against
her
palms
and
stems
of
the
tall
couch
grass
cool
to
her
cheeks
little
blue
butterflies
a
lark
invisible
the
scent
of
the
ripe
hay
and
the
arrows
of
the
sun
on
her
face
and
limbs
to
grow
and
reach
the
hour
of
summer
all
must
do
that
that
was
the
meaning
of
life
she
had
no
more
doubts
and
fears
she
had
no
more
dread
no
bitterness
and
no
remorse
for
what
she
was
going
to
do
she
was
doing
it
because
she
must
as
well
might
grass
stay
its
ripening
because
it
shall
be
cut
down
she
had
instead
a
sense
of
something
blessed
and
uplifting
whatever
power
had
made
her
heart
had
placed
within
it
this
love
whatever
it
was
whoever
it
was
could
not
be
angry
with
her
a
wild
bee
settled
on
her
arm
and
she
held
it
up
between
her
and
the
sun
so
that
she
might
enjoy
its
dusky
glamour
it
would
not
sting
the
little
blue
butterflies
too
kept
alighting
on
her
who
lay
there
so
still
and
the
of
the
never
ceased
nor
the
faint
swish
of
scything
at
last
she
rose
to
make
her
way
home
a
telegram
had
come
saying
simply
she
read
it
with
an
unmoved
face
having
resorted
again
to
her
mask
of
languor
toward
she
confessed
to
headache
and
said
she
would
lie
down
up
there
in
her
room
she
spent
those
three
hours
as
best
she
could
all
she
had
passed
through
in
thought
and
feeling
before
making
her
decision
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
owed
it
to
herself
to
tell
her
lover
how
she
had
come
to
what
she
had
never
thought
to
come
to
she
put
what
she
had
written
in
an
envelope
and
sealed
it
she
would
give
it
to
him
that
he
might
read
and
understand
when
she
had
shown
him
with
all
of
her
how
she
loved
him
it
would
pass
the
time
for
him
until
they
set
out
on
their
new
life
together
for
they
would
make
their
plans
and
start
at
seven
she
sent
word
that
her
headache
was
too
bad
to
allow
her
to
go
out
this
brought
a
visit
from
ercott
the
colonel
and
she
were
so
distressed
but
perhaps
olive
was
wise
not
to
exert
herself
and
presently
the
colonel
himself
spoke
lugubriously
through
the
door
not
well
enough
to
come
no
fun
without
her
but
she
must
on
any
account
strain
herself
no
no
her
heart
smote
her
at
that
he
was
always
so
good
to
her
at
last
watching
from
the
corridor
she
saw
them
sally
forth
down
the
colonel
a
little
in
advance
carrying
his
wife
evening
shoes
how
nice
he
his
brown
face
and
his
grey
moustache
so
upright
and
concerned
with
what
he
had
in
hand
there
was
no
languor
in
her
now
she
had
dressed
in
white
and
now
she
took
a
blue
silk
cloak
with
a
hood
and
caught
up
the
flower
that
had
so
miraculously
survived
last
night
wearing
and
pinned
it
at
her
breast
then
making
sure
no
servant
was
about
she
slipped
downstairs
and
out
it
was
just
eight
and
the
sun
still
glistened
on
the
she
kept
away
from
that
lest
the
birds
should
come
fluttering
about
her
and
betray
her
by
cooing
when
she
had
nearly
reached
the
she
stopped
affrighted
surely
something
had
moved
something
heavy
with
a
sound
of
broken
branches
was
it
the
memory
of
last
night
come
on
her
again
or
indeed
someone
there
she
walked
back
a
few
steps
foolish
alarm
in
the
meadow
beyond
a
cow
was
brushing
against
the
hedge
and
stealing
along
the
grass
out
on
to
the
she
went
swiftly
towards
the
poplar
xix
a
hundred
times
in
these
days
of
her
absence
lennan
had
been
on
the
point
of
going
down
against
her
orders
just
to
pass
the
house
just
to
feel
himself
within
reach
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
perhaps
from
afar
if
his
body
haunted
london
his
spirit
had
passed
down
on
to
that
river
where
he
had
drifted
once
already
reconnoitring
a
hundred
day
in
fancy
and
by
night
in
himself
along
by
the
boughs
he
stole
down
that
dim
backwater
till
the
dark
yews
and
the
white
came
into
view
for
he
thought
now
only
of
fulfilment
she
was
wasting
cruelly
away
why
should
he
leave
her
where
she
was
leave
her
to
profane
herself
and
all
womanhood
in
the
arms
of
a
man
she
hated
and
on
that
day
of
when
he
received
her
telegram
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
handed
the
key
of
paradise
would
she
mean
to
come
away
with
him
that
very
night
he
would
prepare
for
that
at
all
events
he
had
so
often
in
mind
faced
this
crisis
in
his
affairs
that
now
it
only
meant
translating
into
action
what
had
been
carefully
thought
out
he
packed
supplied
himself
liberally
with
money
and
wrote
a
long
letter
to
his
guardian
it
would
hurt
the
old
was
over
seventy
that
could
not
be
helped
he
would
not
post
it
till
he
knew
for
certain
after
telling
how
it
had
all
come
about
he
went
on
thus
i
know
that
to
many
people
and
perhaps
to
you
gordy
it
will
seem
very
wrong
but
it
does
not
to
me
and
that
is
the
simple
truth
everybody
has
his
own
views
on
such
things
i
suppose
and
as
i
would
my
honour
have
held
or
wished
to
hold
or
ever
will
hold
in
marriage
or
out
of
marriage
any
woman
who
does
not
love
me
so
i
do
not
think
it
is
acting
as
i
would
resent
others
acting
towards
me
to
take
away
from
such
unhappiness
this
lady
for
whom
i
would
die
at
any
minute
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
pity
has
anything
to
do
with
thought
so
at
first
but
i
know
now
that
it
is
all
swallowed
up
in
the
most
mighty
feeling
i
have
ever
had
or
ever
shall
have
i
am
not
a
bit
afraid
of
conscience
if
god
is
universal
truth
he
can
not
look
hardly
upon
us
for
being
true
to
ourselves
and
as
to
people
we
shall
just
hold
up
our
heads
i
think
that
they
generally
take
you
at
your
own
valuation
but
anyway
society
does
not
much
matter
we
sha
want
those
who
do
want
may
be
sure
i
hope
he
will
divorce
her
is
nobody
much
to
be
hurt
by
that
except
you
and
cis
but
if
he
ca
be
helped
i
do
think
she
has
anything
but
with
my
six
hundred
and
what
i
can
make
even
if
we
have
to
live
abroad
we
shall
be
all
right
for
money
you
have
been
awfully
good
to
me
always
gordy
and
i
am
very
grieved
to
hurt
you
and
still
more
sorry
if
you
think
i
am
being
ungrateful
but
when
one
feels
as
i
and
soul
and
is
any
question
there
would
be
if
death
itself
stood
in
the
way
if
you
receive
this
we
shall
be
gone
together
i
will
write
to
you
from
wherever
we
pitch
our
tent
and
of
course
i
shall
write
to
cicely
but
will
you
please
tell
doone
and
sylvia
and
give
them
my
love
if
they
still
care
to
have
it
dear
gordy
i
believe
you
would
have
done
the
same
if
you
had
been
i
always
your
in
all
those
preparations
he
forgot
nothing
employing
every
minute
of
the
few
hours
in
a
sort
of
methodic
exaltation
the
last
thing
before
setting
out
he
took
the
damp
cloths
off
his
into
the
face
of
the
monster
there
had
come
of
late
a
hungry
yearning
look
the
artist
in
him
had
done
his
work
that
unconscious
justice
against
his
will
had
set
down
the
truth
and
wondering
whether
he
would
ever
work
at
it
again
he
redamped
the
cloths
and
wrapped
it
carefully
he
did
not
go
to
her
village
but
to
one
five
or
six
miles
down
the
was
safer
and
the
row
would
steady
him
hiring
a
skiff
he
pulled
up
stream
he
travelled
very
slowly
to
kill
time
keeping
under
the
far
bank
and
as
he
pulled
his
very
heart
seemed
parched
with
nervousness
was
it
real
that
he
was
going
to
her
or
only
some
fantastic
trick
of
fate
a
dream
from
which
he
would
wake
to
find
himself
alone
again
he
passed
the
at
last
and
kept
on
till
he
could
round
into
the
backwater
and
steal
up
under
cover
to
the
poplar
he
arrived
a
few
minutes
before
eight
turned
the
boat
round
and
waited
close
beneath
the
bank
holding
to
a
branch
and
standing
so
that
he
could
see
the
path
if
a
man
could
die
from
longing
and
anxiety
surely
lennan
must
have
died
then
all
wind
had
failed
and
the
day
was
fallen
into
a
wonderful
still
evening
gnats
were
dancing
in
the
sparse
strips
of
sunlight
that
slanted
across
the
dark
water
now
that
the
sun
was
low
from
the
fields
bereft
of
workers
came
the
scent
of
hay
and
the
heavy
scent
of
the
musky
odour
of
the
backwater
was
confused
with
them
into
one
brooding
perfume
no
one
passed
and
sounds
were
few
and
far
to
that
wistful
listener
for
birds
did
not
sing
just
there
how
still
and
warm
was
the
air
yet
seemed
to
vibrate
against
his
cheeks
as
though
about
to
break
into
flame
that
fancy
came
to
him
vividly
while
he
stood
vision
of
heat
simmering
in
little
pale
red
flames
on
the
thick
reeds
some
large
slow
dusky
flies
were
still
feeding
and
now
and
then
a
moorhen
a
few
yards
away
splashed
a
little
or
uttered
a
sharp
shrill
note
when
she
she
did
come
would
not
stay
here
in
this
dark
earthy
backwater
he
would
take
her
over
to
the
other
side
away
to
the
woods
but
the
minutes
passed
and
his
heart
sank
then
it
leaped
up
someone
was
white
with
bare
head
and
something
blue
or
black
flung
across
her
arm
it
was
she
no
one
else
walked
like
that
she
came
very
quickly
and
he
noticed
that
her
hair
looked
like
little
wings
on
either
side
of
her
brow
as
if
her
face
were
a
white
bird
with
dark
wings
flying
to
love
now
she
was
close
so
close
that
he
could
see
her
lips
parted
and
her
eyes
nothing
in
the
world
but
darkness
wild
with
dew
and
starlight
he
reached
up
and
lifted
her
down
into
the
boat
and
the
scent
of
some
flower
pressed
against
his
face
seemed
to
pierce
into
him
and
reach
his
very
heart
awakening
the
memory
of
something
past
forgotten
then
seizing
the
branches
snapping
them
in
his
haste
he
dragged
the
skiff
along
through
the
sluggish
water
the
gnats
dancing
in
his
face
she
seemed
to
know
where
he
was
taking
her
and
neither
of
them
spoke
a
single
word
while
he
pulled
out
into
the
open
and
over
to
the
far
bank
there
was
but
one
field
between
them
and
the
field
of
young
wheat
with
a
hedge
of
thorn
and
alder
and
close
to
that
hedge
they
set
out
their
hands
clasped
they
had
nothing
to
say
children
saving
up
she
had
put
on
her
cloak
to
hide
her
dress
and
its
silk
swished
against
the
silvery
blades
of
the
wheat
what
had
moved
her
to
put
on
this
blue
cloak
blue
of
the
sky
and
flowers
of
birds
wings
and
the
blue
of
the
night
the
hue
of
all
holy
things
and
how
still
it
was
in
the
late
gleam
of
the
sun
not
one
little
sound
of
beast
or
bird
or
tree
not
one
bee
humming
and
not
much
the
starry
white
hemlocks
and
flowers
and
the
glamour
of
the
last
warm
light
on
the
wheat
xx
now
over
wood
and
river
the
evening
drew
in
fast
and
first
the
swallows
that
had
looked
as
if
they
would
never
stay
their
hunting
ceased
and
the
light
that
had
seemed
fastened
above
the
world
for
all
its
last
brightenings
slowly
fell
wingless
and
dusky
the
moon
would
not
rise
till
ten
and
all
things
waited
the
creatures
of
night
were
slow
to
come
forth
after
that
long
bright
summer
day
watching
for
the
shades
of
the
trees
to
sink
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
now
water
watching
for
the
face
of
the
sky
to
be
masked
with
velvet
the
very
trees
themselves
seemed
to
wait
in
suspense
for
the
of
night
all
things
stared
wan
in
that
hour
of
passing
things
had
eyes
wistful
and
unblessed
in
those
moments
glamour
was
so
dead
that
it
was
as
if
meaning
had
abandoned
the
earth
but
not
for
long
winged
with
darkness
it
stole
back
not
the
soul
of
meaning
that
had
gone
but
a
and
brooding
spirit
harbouring
in
the
black
trees
in
the
high
dark
spears
of
the
rushes
and
on
the
snags
that
lurked
along
the
river
bank
then
the
owls
came
out
and
things
and
in
the
wood
there
began
a
cruel
dark
pursuit
in
the
twilight
above
the
bracken
the
piercing
shrieks
of
a
creature
into
whom
talons
have
again
and
again
gone
home
and
mingled
with
them
hoarse
raging
cries
of
triumph
many
minutes
they
lasted
those
noises
of
the
night
of
all
the
cruelty
in
the
heart
of
nature
till
at
last
death
appeased
that
savagery
and
any
soul
abroad
that
pitied
fugitives
might
once
more
listen
and
not
weep
then
a
nightingale
began
to
give
forth
its
long
liquid
gurgling
and
a
churred
in
the
young
wheat
again
the
night
brooded
in
the
silent
tops
of
the
trees
in
the
more
silent
depths
of
the
water
it
sent
out
at
long
intervals
a
sigh
or
murmur
a
tiny
scuttling
splash
an
owl
hunting
cry
and
its
breath
was
still
hot
and
charged
with
heavy
odour
for
no
dew
was
falling
xxi
it
was
past
ten
when
they
came
out
from
the
wood
she
had
wanted
to
wait
for
the
moon
to
rise
not
a
gold
coin
of
a
moon
as
last
night
but
ivory
pale
and
with
a
gleaming
radiance
level
over
the
fern
and
covering
the
lower
boughs
as
it
were
with
a
drift
of
white
blossom
through
the
wicket
gate
they
passed
once
more
beside
the
wheat
which
seemed
of
a
different
world
from
that
world
in
which
they
had
walked
but
an
hour
and
a
half
ago
and
in
lennan
heart
was
a
feeling
such
as
a
man
heart
can
only
know
once
in
all
his
humble
gratitude
and
praise
and
adoration
of
her
who
had
given
him
her
all
there
should
be
nothing
for
her
now
but
the
joy
of
this
last
hour
she
should
never
know
less
happiness
and
kneeling
down
before
her
at
the
water
edge
he
kissed
her
dress
and
hands
and
feet
which
would
be
his
forever
then
they
got
into
the
boat
the
smile
of
the
moonlight
glided
over
each
ripple
and
reed
and
closing
over
her
face
where
the
hood
had
fallen
back
from
her
loosened
hair
over
one
hand
trailing
the
water
and
the
other
touching
the
flower
at
her
breast
and
just
above
her
breath
she
said
row
my
dear
love
it
late
dipping
his
sculls
he
shot
the
skiff
into
the
darkness
of
the
backwater
what
happened
then
he
never
knew
never
all
those
after
years
a
vision
of
her
white
form
risen
to
its
feet
bending
forward
like
a
creature
caught
that
can
not
tell
which
way
to
spring
a
crashing
shock
his
head
striking
something
hard
nothingness
and
awful
awful
struggle
with
roots
and
weeds
and
slime
a
desperate
agony
of
groping
in
that
pitchy
blackness
among
in
dead
water
that
seemed
to
have
no
and
that
other
who
had
leaped
at
them
in
the
dark
with
his
boat
like
a
murdering
beast
a
nightmare
search
more
horrible
than
words
could
tell
till
in
a
patch
of
moonlight
on
the
bank
they
laid
her
who
for
all
their
efforts
never
stirred
there
she
lay
all
white
and
they
two
crouched
at
her
head
and
dark
creatures
of
the
woods
and
waters
over
that
which
with
their
hunting
they
had
slain
how
long
they
stayed
there
not
once
looking
at
each
other
not
once
speaking
not
once
ceasing
to
touch
with
their
hands
that
dead
never
knew
how
long
in
the
summer
night
with
its
moonlight
and
its
shadows
quivering
round
them
and
the
night
wind
talking
in
the
reeds
and
then
the
most
enduring
of
all
sentient
things
had
moved
in
him
again
so
that
he
once
more
felt
never
again
to
see
those
eyes
that
had
loved
him
with
their
light
never
again
to
kiss
her
lips
moonlight
to
the
earth
with
the
flower
still
clinging
at
her
breast
thrown
out
on
the
bank
like
a
plucked
dead
no
no
not
dead
alive
in
the
to
not
on
this
dim
bank
in
this
hideous
backwater
with
that
dark
dumb
creature
who
had
destroyed
her
out
there
on
the
the
wood
of
their
alive
and
staggering
up
past
cramier
who
never
moved
he
got
into
his
boat
and
like
one
demented
pulled
out
into
the
stream
but
once
there
in
the
tide
he
fell
huddled
forward
motionless
above
his
oars
and
the
moonlight
flooded
his
dark
skiff
drifting
down
and
the
moonlight
effaced
the
ripples
on
the
water
that
had
stolen
away
her
spirit
her
spirit
mingled
now
with
the
white
beauty
and
the
shadows
for
ever
part
of
the
stillness
and
the
passion
of
a
summer
night
hovering
floating
listening
to
the
rustle
of
the
reeds
and
the
whispering
of
the
woods
one
with
the
endless
spirit
passing
out
as
all
might
wish
to
pass
in
the
hour
of
happiness
part
i
when
on
that
november
night
lennan
stole
to
the
open
door
of
his
and
stood
watching
his
wife
asleep
fate
still
waited
for
an
answer
a
low
fire
was
of
those
fires
that
throw
faint
shadows
everywhere
and
once
and
again
glow
so
that
some
object
shines
for
a
moment
some
shape
is
clearly
seen
the
curtains
were
not
quite
drawn
and
a
branch
with
leaves
still
hanging
which
had
kept
them
company
all
the
fifteen
years
they
had
lived
there
was
moving
darkly
in
the
wind
now
touching
the
glass
with
a
frail
tap
as
though
asking
of
him
who
had
been
roaming
in
that
wind
so
many
hours
to
let
it
in
unfailing
he
had
not
dared
hope
that
sylvia
would
be
asleep
it
was
merciful
that
she
was
whichever
way
the
issue
issue
so
cruel
her
face
was
turned
towards
the
fire
and
one
hand
rested
beneath
her
cheek
so
she
often
slept
even
when
life
seemed
all
at
sea
its
landmarks
lost
one
still
did
what
was
customary
poor
had
not
slept
since
he
told
her
hours
that
seemed
such
years
ago
with
her
flaxen
hair
and
her
touching
candour
even
in
sleep
she
looked
like
a
girl
lying
there
not
so
greatly
changed
from
what
she
had
been
that
summer
of
cicely
marriage
down
at
hayle
her
face
had
not
grown
old
in
all
those
years
there
had
been
till
now
no
special
reason
why
it
should
thought
strong
feeling
suffering
those
were
what
changed
faces
sylvia
had
never
thought
very
deeply
never
suffered
much
till
now
and
was
it
for
him
who
had
been
careful
of
careful
on
the
whole
despite
man
selfishness
despite
her
never
having
understood
the
depths
of
it
for
him
of
all
people
to
hurt
her
so
to
stamp
her
face
with
sorrow
perhaps
destroy
her
utterly
he
crept
a
little
farther
in
and
sat
down
in
the
beyond
the
fire
what
memories
a
fire
gathered
into
it
with
its
flaky
ashes
its
little
flames
and
that
quiet
glow
and
flicker
what
tale
of
passions
how
like
to
a
fire
was
a
man
heart
the
first
young
fitful
leapings
the
sudden
fierce
mastering
heat
the
long
steady
sober
burning
and
last
that
clutch
back
at
its
own
vanished
youth
the
final
eager
flight
of
flame
before
the
ashes
wintered
it
to
nothing
visions
and
memories
he
saw
down
in
the
fire
as
only
can
be
seen
when
a
man
heart
by
the
agony
of
long
struggle
has
been
stripped
of
skin
and
quivers
at
every
touch
love
a
strange
haphazard
thing
was
spun
between
ecstacy
and
torture
a
thing
insidious
irresponsible
desperate
a
flying
sweetness
more
poignant
than
anything
on
earth
more
dark
in
origin
and
destiny
a
thing
without
reason
or
coherence
a
man
say
had
he
in
the
ebb
and
flow
of
it
no
more
than
in
the
flights
of
autumn
birds
swooping
down
alighting
here
and
there
passing
on
the
loves
one
left
in
a
life
by
no
means
vagabond
in
love
as
men
lives
went
the
love
that
thought
the
tyrol
skies
would
fall
if
he
were
not
first
with
a
certain
lady
the
love
whose
star
had
caught
in
the
hair
of
sylvia
now
lying
there
asleep
a
yet
sordid
little
meal
of
pleasure
which
youth
however
sensitive
must
eat
it
seems
some
time
or
other
with
some
young
light
of
glimpse
of
life
that
beforehand
had
seemed
much
and
had
meant
little
save
to
leave
him
disillusioned
with
himself
and
sorry
for
his
partner
and
then
the
love
that
he
could
not
even
after
twenty
years
bear
to
remember
that
summer
passion
which
in
one
night
had
gained
all
and
lost
all
terribly
leaving
on
his
soul
a
scar
that
could
never
be
quite
healed
leaving
his
spirit
always
a
little
lonely
haunted
by
the
sense
of
what
might
have
been
of
his
share
in
that
night
of
accident
on
the
one
had
ever
dreamed
and
then
the
long
despair
which
had
seemed
the
last
death
of
love
had
slowly
passed
and
yet
another
love
had
been
rather
born
again
pale
sober
but
quite
real
the
fresh
of
a
feeling
long
forgotten
of
that
protective
devotion
of
his
boyhood
he
still
remembered
the
expression
on
sylvia
face
when
he
passed
her
by
chance
in
oxford
street
soon
after
he
came
back
from
his
four
years
of
exile
in
the
east
and
look
eager
yet
reproachful
then
stoically
ironic
as
if
saying
no
after
forgetting
me
four
years
and
remember
me
now
and
when
he
spoke
the
still
more
touching
pleasure
in
her
face
then
uncertain
months
with
a
feeling
of
what
the
end
would
be
and
then
their
marriage
happy
not
very
vivid
nor
spiritually
very
work
always
secretly
as
remote
from
her
as
when
she
had
thought
to
please
him
by
putting
jessamine
stars
on
the
heads
of
his
beasts
a
quiet
successful
union
not
meaning
he
had
thought
so
very
much
to
him
nor
so
very
much
to
hours
ago
he
told
her
and
she
had
shrunk
and
wilted
and
gone
all
to
pieces
and
what
was
it
he
had
told
her
a
long
sitting
there
by
the
fire
with
nothing
yet
decided
he
could
see
it
all
from
the
start
with
its
devilish
delicate
intricacy
its
subtle
slow
enchantment
spinning
itself
out
of
him
out
of
his
own
state
of
mind
and
body
rather
than
out
of
the
spell
cast
over
him
as
though
a
sort
of
fatal
force
long
dormant
were
working
up
again
to
burst
into
dark
flower
ii
yes
it
had
begun
within
him
over
a
year
ago
with
a
queer
unhappy
restlessness
a
feeling
that
life
was
slipping
ebbing
away
within
reach
of
him
and
his
arms
never
stretched
out
to
arrest
it
it
had
begun
with
a
sort
of
long
craving
stilled
only
when
he
was
working
craving
for
he
knew
not
what
an
ache
which
was
worst
whenever
the
wind
was
soft
they
said
that
about
was
a
perilous
age
for
a
for
an
artist
all
the
autumn
of
last
year
he
had
felt
this
vague
misery
rather
badly
it
had
left
him
alone
most
of
december
and
january
while
he
was
working
so
hard
at
his
group
of
lions
but
the
moment
that
was
finished
it
had
gripped
him
hard
again
in
those
last
days
of
january
he
well
remembered
wandering
about
in
the
parks
day
after
day
trying
to
get
away
from
it
mild
weather
with
a
scent
in
the
wind
with
what
avidity
he
had
watched
children
playing
the
premature
buds
on
the
bushes
anything
everything
what
an
ache
too
he
had
been
conscious
of
innumerable
lives
being
lived
round
him
and
loves
loved
and
he
outside
unable
to
know
to
grasp
to
gather
them
and
all
the
time
the
sands
of
his
hourglass
running
out
a
most
absurd
and
unreasonable
feeling
for
a
man
with
everything
he
wanted
with
work
that
he
loved
quite
enough
money
and
a
wife
so
good
as
feeling
that
no
englishman
of
in
excellent
health
ought
for
a
moment
to
have
been
troubled
with
a
feeling
such
as
indeed
no
englishman
ever
admitted
that
there
was
not
even
as
yet
a
society
for
its
suppression
for
what
was
this
disquiet
feeling
but
the
sense
that
he
had
had
his
day
would
never
again
know
the
stir
and
fearful
joy
of
falling
in
love
but
only
just
hanker
after
what
was
past
and
gone
could
anything
be
more
reprehensible
in
a
married
man
it
last
day
of
january
when
returning
from
one
of
those
restless
rambles
in
hyde
park
he
met
dromore
queer
to
recognize
a
man
hardly
seen
since
yet
unmistakably
johnny
dromore
sauntering
along
the
rails
of
piccadilly
on
the
green
park
side
with
that
slightly
rolling
gait
of
his
thin
horseman
legs
his
dandified
hat
a
little
to
one
side
those
strange
chaffing
goggling
eyes
that
look
as
if
making
a
perpetual
bet
very
same
teasing
now
moody
now
reckless
always
astute
johnny
dromore
with
a
good
heart
beneath
an
outside
that
seemed
ashamed
of
it
truly
to
have
shared
a
room
at
have
been
at
college
together
were
links
mysteriously
indestructible
mark
lennan
by
gum
have
seen
you
for
ages
not
since
you
turned
out
a
call
it
awfully
glad
to
meet
you
old
chap
here
was
the
past
indeed
long
vanished
in
feeling
and
thought
and
all
and
lennan
head
buzzed
trying
to
find
some
common
interest
with
this
hunting
racing
johnny
dromore
come
to
life
whom
the
machine
had
stamped
with
astute
simplicity
by
the
time
he
was
and
for
ever
after
left
untouched
in
thought
and
dromore
who
would
never
pass
beyond
the
philosophy
that
all
was
queer
and
freakish
which
had
not
to
do
with
horses
women
wine
cigars
jokes
and
that
perpetual
bet
johnny
dromore
who
somewhere
in
him
had
a
pocket
of
depth
a
streak
of
hunger
that
was
not
just
johnny
dromore
how
queer
was
the
sound
of
that
jerky
talk
you
ever
see
old
fookes
now
been
racin
at
all
you
live
in
town
remember
good
old
blenker
and
then
silence
and
then
another
spurt
ever
go
down
to
ever
go
racin
come
on
up
to
my
you
got
nothin
to
no
persuading
johnny
dromore
that
a
call
it
could
have
anything
to
do
come
on
old
chap
got
the
hump
it
this
damned
east
well
he
remembered
it
when
they
shared
a
room
at
hump
of
johnny
dromore
after
some
reckless
spree
or
bout
of
teasing
and
down
that
narrow
of
piccadilly
he
had
gone
and
up
into
those
on
the
first
floor
with
their
little
dark
hall
their
van
beers
drawing
and
vanity
fair
cartoons
and
prints
of
racehorses
and
of
the
old
nightgown
steeplechase
with
the
big
chairs
and
all
the
paraphernalia
of
race
guides
and
and
and
and
yet
something
that
from
the
first
moment
struck
him
as
not
quite
in
keeping
foreign
to
the
little
jumble
of
books
a
vase
of
flowers
a
grey
kitten
sit
down
old
chap
what
you
drink
sunk
into
the
recesses
of
a
marvellous
chair
with
huge
arms
of
tawny
leather
he
listened
and
spoke
drowsily
oxford
old
gordy
gone
now
long
passed
by
they
seemed
all
round
him
once
again
and
yet
always
that
vague
sense
threading
this
resurrection
threading
the
smoke
of
their
cigars
and
johnny
clipped
something
that
did
not
quite
belong
might
it
be
perhaps
that
sepia
the
on
the
oak
sideboard
at
the
far
a
woman
face
gazing
out
into
the
room
mysteriously
unlike
everything
else
except
the
flowers
and
this
kitten
that
was
pushing
its
furry
little
head
against
his
hand
odd
how
a
single
thing
sometimes
took
possession
of
a
room
however
remote
in
spirit
it
seemed
to
reach
like
a
shadow
over
dromore
outstretched
limbs
and
weathered
face
behind
his
huge
cigar
over
the
queer
solemn
chaffing
eyes
with
something
brooding
in
the
depths
of
them
ever
get
the
hump
bally
awful
is
it
it
getting
old
we
bally
old
you
know
lenny
ah
no
one
had
called
him
for
twenty
years
and
it
was
true
they
were
unmentionably
old
when
a
fellow
begins
to
feel
old
you
know
it
time
he
went
something
does
bear
sittin
down
and
lookin
at
come
out
to
with
me
that
old
wound
never
quite
healed
started
throbbing
at
the
word
so
that
he
could
hardly
speak
his
no
i
do
care
for
and
at
once
he
saw
dromore
eyes
probing
questioning
you
married
never
thought
of
you
as
married
so
dromore
did
think
of
him
queer
he
never
thought
of
johnny
dromore
winter
bally
awful
when
you
not
huntin
you
changed
a
lot
should
hardly
have
known
you
last
time
i
saw
you
you
just
come
back
from
rome
or
somewhere
what
it
like
bein
sculptor
saw
something
of
yours
once
ever
do
things
of
horses
yes
he
had
done
a
of
ponies
only
last
year
you
do
women
too
i
not
the
eyes
goggled
slightly
quaint
that
unholy
interest
just
like
boys
the
johnny
never
grow
up
no
matter
how
life
treated
them
if
dromore
spoke
out
his
soul
as
he
used
to
speak
it
out
at
he
would
say
get
a
pull
there
you
have
a
bally
good
time
i
expect
that
was
the
way
it
took
them
just
a
converse
manifestation
of
the
very
same
feeling
towards
art
that
the
pious
philistines
had
with
their
deploring
eyebrows
and
their
to
the
soul
babes
all
not
a
glimmering
of
what
art
its
effort
and
its
yearnings
you
make
money
at
it
oh
again
that
appreciative
goggle
as
who
should
say
there
more
in
this
than
i
thought
a
long
silence
then
in
the
dusk
with
the
violet
glimmer
from
outside
the
windows
the
fire
flickering
in
front
of
them
the
grey
kitten
purring
against
his
neck
the
smoke
of
their
cigars
going
up
and
such
a
strange
dozing
sense
of
rest
as
he
had
not
known
for
many
days
and
someone
at
the
door
over
by
the
sideboard
and
dromore
speaking
in
a
queer
voice
come
in
nell
know
my
daughter
a
hand
took
lennan
a
hand
that
seemed
to
waver
between
the
aplomb
of
a
woman
of
the
world
and
a
child
impulsive
warmth
and
a
voice
young
clipped
clear
said
how
do
she
rather
sweet
is
kitten
then
dromore
turned
the
light
up
a
figure
fairly
tall
in
a
grey
stupendously
well
cut
a
face
not
quite
so
round
as
a
child
nor
so
shaped
as
a
woman
blushing
slightly
very
calm
crinkly
hair
tied
back
with
a
black
ribbon
under
a
neat
hat
and
eyes
like
those
eyes
of
gainsborough
grey
mesmeric
with
long
lashes
curling
up
eyes
that
draw
things
to
them
still
innocent
and
just
on
the
point
of
saying
i
thought
you
stepped
out
of
that
picture
saw
dromore
face
and
mumbled
instead
so
it
your
kitten
yes
she
goes
to
everybody
do
you
like
persians
she
all
fur
really
feel
entering
with
his
fingers
the
recesses
of
the
kitten
he
said
cats
without
fur
are
have
you
seen
one
without
fur
oh
yes
in
my
profession
we
have
to
go
below
a
that
must
be
awfully
what
a
woman
of
the
world
but
what
a
child
too
and
now
he
could
see
that
the
face
in
the
sepia
drawing
was
older
not
so
full
look
not
so
innocent
cheeks
not
so
round
and
something
sad
and
desperate
about
face
that
life
had
rudely
touched
but
the
same
eyes
it
what
charm
for
all
its
disillusionment
its
air
of
a
history
then
he
noticed
fastened
to
the
frame
on
a
thin
rod
a
curtain
drawn
to
one
side
the
young
voice
was
saying
would
you
mind
if
i
showed
you
my
drawings
it
would
be
awfully
good
of
you
you
could
tell
me
about
and
with
dismay
he
saw
her
open
a
portfolio
while
he
scrutinized
those
schoolgirl
drawings
he
could
feel
her
looking
at
him
as
animals
do
when
they
are
making
up
their
minds
whether
or
no
to
like
you
then
she
came
and
stood
so
close
that
her
arm
pressed
his
he
redoubled
his
efforts
to
find
something
good
about
the
drawings
but
in
truth
there
was
nothing
good
and
if
in
other
matters
he
could
lie
well
enough
to
save
people
feelings
where
art
was
concerned
he
never
could
so
he
merely
said
you
have
been
taught
you
will
you
teach
me
but
before
he
could
answer
she
was
already
effacing
that
naive
question
in
her
most
manner
of
course
i
ought
to
ask
it
would
bore
you
after
that
he
vaguely
remembered
dromore
asking
if
he
ever
rode
in
the
row
and
those
eyes
of
hers
following
him
about
and
her
hand
giving
his
another
childish
squeeze
then
he
was
on
his
way
again
down
the
stairs
past
an
interminable
array
of
vanity
fair
cartoons
out
into
the
east
wind
iii
crossing
the
green
park
on
his
way
home
was
he
more
or
less
restless
difficult
to
say
a
little
flattered
certainly
a
little
warmed
yet
irritated
as
always
when
he
came
into
contact
with
people
to
whom
the
world
of
art
was
such
an
amusing
unreality
the
notion
of
trying
to
show
that
child
how
to
with
her
riding
and
her
kitten
and
her
eyes
quaint
how
she
had
at
once
made
friends
with
him
he
was
a
little
different
perhaps
from
what
she
was
accustomed
to
and
how
daintily
she
spoke
a
strange
attractive
almost
lovely
child
certainly
not
more
than
daughter
the
wind
was
bitter
the
lamps
bright
among
the
naked
trees
beautiful
at
night
even
in
january
even
in
an
east
wind
with
a
beauty
he
never
tired
of
its
great
dark
chiselled
shapes
its
gleaming
lights
like
droves
of
flying
stars
come
to
earth
and
all
warmed
by
the
beat
and
stir
of
innumerable
lives
that
he
ached
so
to
know
and
to
be
part
of
he
told
sylvia
of
his
encounter
dromore
the
name
struck
her
she
had
an
old
irish
song
castle
of
dromore
with
a
queer
haunting
refrain
it
froze
hard
all
the
week
and
he
began
a
group
of
their
two
then
a
thaw
set
in
with
that
first
wind
which
brings
each
february
a
feeling
of
spring
such
as
is
never
again
recaptured
and
men
senses
like
sleepy
bees
in
the
sun
go
roving
it
awakened
in
him
more
violently
than
ever
the
thirst
to
be
living
knowing
craving
for
something
new
not
this
of
course
took
him
back
to
dromore
rooms
oh
no
just
friendliness
since
he
had
not
even
told
his
old
where
he
lived
or
said
that
his
wife
would
be
glad
to
make
his
acquaintance
if
he
cared
to
come
round
for
johnny
dromore
had
assuredly
not
seemed
too
happy
under
all
his
air
yes
it
was
but
friendly
to
go
again
dromore
was
seated
in
his
long
a
cigar
between
his
lips
a
pencil
in
his
hand
a
ruff
guide
on
his
knee
beside
him
was
a
large
green
book
there
was
a
festive
air
about
him
very
different
from
his
spasmodic
gloom
of
the
other
day
and
he
murmured
without
rising
halo
old
man
to
see
you
take
a
pew
look
here
think
i
ought
to
put
her
diavolo
or
ponte
canet
more
than
four
crosses
of
paul
goin
to
get
a
real
good
one
from
her
this
time
he
who
had
never
heard
these
sainted
names
answered
oh
ponte
canet
without
doubt
but
if
you
working
i
come
in
another
lord
no
have
a
smoke
i
just
finish
lookin
out
their
take
a
and
so
lennan
sat
down
to
watch
those
researches
wreathed
in
cigar
smoke
and
punctuated
by
muttered
expletives
they
were
as
sacred
and
absorbing
no
doubt
as
his
own
efforts
to
create
in
clay
for
before
dromore
inner
vision
was
the
perfect
too
was
creating
here
was
no
mere
dodge
for
making
money
but
a
process
hallowed
by
the
peculiar
sensation
felt
when
one
rubbed
the
palms
of
the
hands
together
the
sensation
that
accompanied
all
creative
achievement
once
only
dromore
paused
to
turn
his
head
and
say
bally
hard
gettin
a
taproot
right
real
art
how
well
an
artist
knew
that
desperate
search
after
the
point
of
balance
the
central
rivet
that
must
be
found
before
a
form
would
come
to
life
and
he
noted
that
there
was
no
kitten
no
flowers
no
sense
at
all
of
an
extraneous
the
picture
was
curtained
had
the
girl
been
just
a
fancy
conjured
up
by
his
craving
after
youth
then
he
saw
that
dromore
had
dropped
the
large
green
book
and
was
standing
before
the
fire
nell
took
to
you
the
other
day
but
you
always
were
a
lady
man
remember
the
girl
at
coaster
coaster
where
he
would
go
every
afternoon
that
he
had
money
just
for
the
pleasure
of
looking
shyly
at
a
face
something
beautiful
to
look
more
johnny
dromore
would
no
better
understand
that
now
than
when
they
were
at
not
the
smallest
good
even
trying
to
explain
he
looked
up
at
the
goggling
eyes
he
heard
the
bantering
voice
i
are
goin
grey
we
bally
old
lenny
a
fellow
gets
old
when
he
and
he
answered
by
the
way
i
never
knew
that
you
had
from
dromore
face
the
chaffing
look
went
like
a
blown
out
and
a
coppery
flush
spread
over
it
for
some
seconds
he
did
not
speak
then
jerking
his
head
towards
the
picture
he
muttered
gruffly
never
had
the
chance
of
marrying
there
nell
a
sort
of
anger
leaped
in
lennan
why
should
dromore
speak
that
word
as
if
he
were
ashamed
of
his
own
daughter
just
like
his
so
hidebound
as
flotsam
on
the
tide
of
other
opinions
poor
devils
adrift
without
the
one
true
anchorage
of
their
own
real
feelings
and
doubtful
whether
dromore
would
be
pleased
or
think
him
gushing
or
even
distrustful
of
his
morality
he
said
as
for
that
it
would
only
make
any
decent
man
or
woman
nicer
to
her
when
is
she
going
to
let
me
teach
her
drawing
dromore
crossed
the
room
drew
back
the
curtain
of
the
picture
and
in
a
muffled
voice
said
my
god
lenny
life
unfair
nell
coming
killed
her
mother
rather
it
had
been
chaff
women
have
no
lennan
got
up
from
his
comfortable
chair
for
startled
out
of
the
past
the
memory
of
that
summer
night
when
yet
another
woman
had
no
luck
was
flooding
his
heart
with
its
black
inextinguishable
grief
he
said
quietly
the
past
is
past
old
dromore
drew
the
curtain
again
across
the
picture
and
came
back
to
the
fire
and
for
a
full
minute
he
stared
into
it
what
am
i
to
do
with
nell
she
growing
what
have
you
done
with
her
so
far
she
been
at
school
in
the
summer
she
goes
to
got
a
bit
of
an
old
place
there
she
be
eighteen
in
july
i
shall
have
to
introduce
her
to
women
and
all
that
it
the
devil
how
who
lennan
could
only
murmur
my
wife
for
he
took
his
leave
soon
after
johnny
dromore
bizarre
guardian
for
that
child
queer
life
she
must
have
of
it
in
that
bachelor
den
surrounded
by
ruff
guides
what
would
become
of
her
caught
up
by
some
young
spark
about
town
married
to
him
no
father
would
see
to
the
thoroughness
of
that
his
standard
of
respectability
was
evidently
high
and
the
way
maybe
of
her
poor
thing
in
the
picture
with
the
alluring
desperate
face
well
it
was
no
business
of
his
iv
no
business
of
his
the
merest
sense
of
comradeship
then
took
him
once
more
to
dromore
after
that
disclosure
to
prove
that
the
word
had
no
significance
save
in
his
friend
own
fancy
to
assure
him
again
that
sylvia
would
be
very
glad
to
welcome
the
child
at
any
time
she
liked
to
come
when
he
had
told
her
of
that
little
matter
of
nell
birth
she
had
been
silent
a
long
minute
looking
in
his
face
and
then
had
said
poor
child
i
wonder
if
she
knows
people
are
so
unkind
even
nowadays
he
could
not
himself
think
of
anyone
who
would
pay
attention
to
such
a
thing
except
to
be
kinder
to
the
girl
but
in
such
matters
sylvia
was
the
better
judge
in
closer
touch
with
general
thought
she
met
people
that
he
did
of
a
more
normal
species
it
was
rather
late
when
he
got
to
dromore
diggings
on
that
third
visit
mr
dromore
sir
the
man
had
one
of
those
strictly
confidential
faces
bestowed
by
an
providence
on
servants
in
the
neighbourhood
of
mr
dromore
sir
is
not
in
but
he
will
be
almost
sure
to
be
in
to
dress
miss
nell
is
in
and
there
she
was
sitting
at
the
table
pasting
photographs
into
an
young
creature
in
that
abode
of
male
lennan
stood
unheard
gazing
at
the
back
of
her
head
with
its
thick
hair
tied
back
on
her
frock
and
to
the
confidential
man
soft
mr
lennan
miss
he
added
a
softer
may
i
come
in
she
put
her
hand
into
his
with
intense
composure
oh
yes
do
if
you
do
mind
the
mess
i
making
and
with
a
little
squeeze
of
the
tips
of
his
fingers
added
would
it
bore
you
to
see
my
photographs
and
down
they
sat
together
before
the
of
people
with
guns
or
little
groups
of
schoolgirls
kittens
dromore
and
herself
on
horseback
and
several
of
a
young
man
with
a
broad
daring
rather
face
that
first
cousin
once
removed
rather
nice
is
he
do
you
like
his
expression
lennan
did
not
know
not
her
second
cousin
her
father
first
cousin
once
removed
and
again
there
leaped
in
him
that
unreasoning
flame
of
indignant
pity
and
how
about
drawing
you
have
come
to
be
taught
she
went
almost
as
red
as
her
frock
i
thought
you
were
only
being
polite
i
ought
to
have
asked
of
course
i
want
to
i
know
it
bore
it
wo
at
she
looked
up
at
that
what
peculiar
languorous
eyes
they
were
shall
i
come
then
any
day
you
like
between
twelve
and
where
he
took
out
a
card
mark
like
your
name
i
liked
it
the
other
day
awfully
nice
what
was
in
a
name
that
she
should
like
him
because
of
it
his
fame
as
a
as
it
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
for
she
would
certainly
not
know
of
it
ah
but
there
was
a
lot
in
a
children
in
his
childhood
what
fascination
there
had
been
in
the
words
macaroon
and
spaniard
and
carinola
and
aldebaran
and
mccrae
for
quite
a
week
the
whole
world
had
been
most
ordinary
friend
of
gordy
by
whatever
fascination
moved
she
talked
freely
enough
her
school
of
riding
and
seemed
to
love
going
very
fast
about
was
and
of
the
type
that
johnny
dromore
might
be
expected
to
approve
these
together
with
and
lear
were
all
she
had
seen
never
was
a
girl
so
untouched
by
thought
or
not
stupid
having
seemingly
a
certain
natural
good
taste
only
nothing
evidently
had
come
her
way
how
could
dromore
duce
et
auspice
johnny
dromore
she
had
been
taken
indeed
to
the
national
gallery
while
at
school
and
lennan
had
a
vision
of
eight
or
ten
young
maidens
trailing
round
at
the
skirts
of
one
old
maiden
admiring
landseer
dogs
giggling
faintly
at
botticelli
angels
gaping
rustling
chattering
like
young
birds
in
a
shrubbery
but
with
all
her
surroundings
this
child
of
johnny
dromoredom
was
as
yet
more
innocent
than
cultured
girls
of
the
same
age
if
those
grey
mesmeric
eyes
of
hers
followed
him
about
they
did
so
frankly
unconsciously
there
was
no
minx
in
her
so
far
an
hour
went
by
and
dromore
did
not
come
and
the
loneliness
of
this
young
creature
in
her
incongruous
abode
began
telling
on
equanimity
what
did
she
do
in
the
evenings
sometimes
i
go
to
the
theatre
with
dad
generally
i
stay
at
and
then
oh
i
just
read
or
talk
what
to
yourself
yes
or
to
oliver
sometimes
when
he
comes
so
oliver
came
in
how
long
have
you
known
oliver
oh
ever
since
i
was
a
he
wanted
to
say
and
how
long
is
that
but
managed
to
refrain
and
got
up
to
go
instead
she
caught
his
sleeve
and
said
you
not
to
go
saying
that
she
looked
as
a
dog
will
going
to
bite
in
fun
her
upper
lip
shortened
above
her
small
white
teeth
set
fast
on
her
lower
lip
and
her
chin
thrust
a
little
forward
a
glimpse
of
a
wilful
spirit
but
as
soon
as
he
had
smiled
and
murmured
ah
but
i
must
you
see
she
at
once
regained
her
manners
only
saying
rather
mournfully
you
do
call
me
by
my
name
do
you
like
it
nell
yes
it
really
eleanor
of
course
do
you
like
it
if
he
had
detested
the
name
he
could
only
have
answered
very
i
awfully
glad
when
he
got
out
into
the
street
he
felt
terribly
like
a
man
who
instead
of
having
had
his
sleeve
touched
has
had
his
heart
plucked
at
and
that
warm
bewildered
feeling
lasted
him
all
the
way
home
changing
for
dinner
he
looked
at
himself
with
unwonted
attention
yes
his
dark
hair
was
still
thick
but
going
distinctly
grey
there
were
very
many
lines
about
his
eyes
too
and
those
eyes
still
eager
when
they
smiled
were
particularly
deepset
as
if
life
had
forced
them
back
his
cheekbones
were
almost
now
and
his
cheeks
very
thin
and
dark
and
his
jaw
looked
too
set
and
bony
below
the
almost
black
moustache
altogether
a
face
that
life
had
worn
a
good
deal
with
nothing
for
a
child
to
take
a
fancy
to
and
make
friends
with
that
he
could
see
sylvia
came
in
while
he
was
thus
taking
stock
of
himself
bringing
a
flask
of
she
was
always
bringing
him
was
anyone
so
sweet
in
those
ways
in
that
grey
frock
her
white
still
prettiness
and
hair
so
little
touched
by
time
only
just
fell
short
of
real
beauty
for
lack
of
a
spice
of
depth
and
of
incisiveness
just
as
her
spirit
lacked
he
knew
not
what
of
poignancy
he
would
not
for
the
world
have
let
her
know
that
he
ever
felt
that
lack
if
a
man
could
not
hide
little
rifts
in
the
lute
from
one
so
good
and
humble
and
affectionate
he
was
not
fit
to
live
she
sang
castle
of
dromore
again
that
night
with
its
queer
haunting
lilt
and
when
she
had
gone
up
and
he
was
smoking
over
the
fire
the
girl
in
her
frock
seemed
to
come
and
sit
opposite
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
his
just
as
she
had
been
sitting
while
they
talked
dark
red
had
suited
her
suited
the
look
on
her
face
when
she
said
you
not
to
go
odd
indeed
if
she
had
not
some
devil
in
her
with
that
parentage
v
next
day
they
had
summoned
him
from
the
studio
to
see
a
peculiar
dromore
very
well
groomed
talking
to
sylvia
with
unnatural
suavity
and
carefully
masking
the
goggle
in
his
eyes
lennan
ride
ah
too
busy
of
course
helped
mark
with
really
read
a
lot
no
doubt
never
had
any
time
for
bore
not
having
time
to
read
and
sylvia
listening
and
smiling
very
still
and
soft
what
had
dromore
come
for
to
spy
out
the
land
discover
why
lennan
and
his
wife
thought
nothing
of
the
word
in
fact
their
household
was
respectable
a
man
must
always
look
twice
at
even
if
they
have
shared
his
room
at
school
to
his
credit
of
course
to
be
so
careful
of
his
daughter
at
the
expense
of
time
owed
to
the
creation
of
the
perfect
racehorse
on
the
whole
he
seemed
to
be
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
they
might
be
useful
to
nell
in
the
uncomfortable
time
at
hand
when
she
would
have
to
go
about
seemed
even
to
be
falling
under
the
spell
of
sylvia
transparent
his
habitual
vigilance
against
being
scored
off
in
life
perpetual
bet
parting
with
his
armour
of
chaff
almost
a
relief
indeed
once
out
of
sylvia
presence
to
see
that
familiar
unholy
curiosity
creeping
back
into
his
eyes
as
though
they
were
hoping
against
parental
hope
to
find
somewhere
about
that
mysterious
mecca
of
good
studio
delicious
to
watch
the
conflict
between
relief
and
disappointment
alas
no
even
a
statue
without
clothes
nothing
but
portrait
heads
casts
of
animals
and
nothing
that
could
bring
a
blush
to
the
cheek
of
the
young
person
or
a
glow
to
the
eyes
of
a
johnny
dromore
with
what
curious
silence
he
walked
round
and
round
the
group
of
inquiring
into
them
with
that
long
crinkled
nose
of
his
with
what
curious
suddenness
he
said
damned
good
you
would
do
me
one
of
nell
on
horseback
with
what
dubious
watchfulness
he
listened
to
the
answer
i
might
perhaps
do
a
statuette
of
her
if
i
did
you
should
have
a
did
he
think
that
in
some
way
he
was
being
outmanoeuvered
for
he
remained
some
seconds
in
a
sort
of
trance
before
muttering
as
though
clinching
a
bet
done
and
if
you
want
to
ride
with
her
to
get
the
hang
of
it
i
can
always
mount
when
he
had
gone
lennan
remained
staring
at
his
unfinished
in
the
gathering
dusk
again
that
sense
of
irritation
at
contact
with
something
strange
hostile
uncomprehending
why
let
these
dromores
into
his
life
like
this
he
shut
the
studio
and
went
back
to
the
sylvia
was
sitting
on
the
fender
gazing
at
the
fire
and
she
edged
along
so
as
to
rest
against
his
knees
the
light
from
a
candle
on
her
was
shining
on
her
hair
her
cheek
and
chin
that
years
had
so
little
altered
a
pretty
picture
she
made
with
just
that
candle
flame
swaying
there
burning
slowly
surely
down
the
pale
flame
of
all
lifeless
things
most
living
most
like
a
spirit
so
bland
and
vague
one
would
hardly
have
known
it
was
fire
at
all
a
drift
of
wind
blew
it
this
way
and
that
he
got
up
to
shut
the
window
and
as
he
came
back
sylvia
said
i
like
dromore
i
think
he
nicer
than
he
he
asked
me
to
make
a
statuette
of
his
daughter
on
and
will
you
i
do
if
she
really
so
pretty
you
pretty
hardly
the
she
not
she
turned
round
and
looked
up
at
him
and
instinctively
he
felt
that
something
difficult
to
answer
was
coming
next
i
wanted
to
ask
you
are
you
really
happy
nowadays
of
course
why
not
what
else
to
be
said
to
speak
of
those
feelings
of
the
last
few
feelings
so
ridiculous
to
anyone
who
had
them
only
disturb
her
horribly
and
having
received
her
answer
sylvia
turned
back
to
the
fire
resting
silently
against
his
knees
three
days
later
the
suddenly
abandoned
the
pose
into
which
he
had
lured
them
with
such
difficulty
and
made
for
the
studio
door
there
in
the
street
was
nell
dromore
mounted
on
a
narrow
little
black
horse
with
a
white
star
a
white
hoof
and
devilish
little
goat
ears
pricked
and
very
close
together
at
the
tips
dad
said
i
had
better
ride
round
and
show
you
magpie
he
not
very
good
at
standing
still
are
those
your
dogs
what
darlings
she
had
slipped
her
knee
already
from
the
pummel
and
slid
down
the
were
instantly
on
their
propping
themselves
against
her
waist
lennan
held
the
black
bizarre
little
beast
all
fire
and
whipcord
with
a
skin
like
satin
liquid
eyes
very
straight
hocks
and
a
thin
reaching
down
to
them
the
little
creature
had
none
of
those
commonplace
good
looks
so
discouraging
to
artists
he
had
forgotten
its
rider
till
she
looked
up
from
the
dogs
and
said
do
you
like
him
it
is
nice
of
you
to
be
going
to
do
when
she
had
ridden
away
looking
back
until
she
turned
the
corner
he
tried
to
lure
the
two
dogs
once
more
to
their
pose
but
they
would
sit
no
more
going
continually
to
the
door
listening
and
sniffing
and
everything
felt
disturbed
and
out
of
gear
that
same
afternoon
at
sylvia
suggestion
he
went
with
her
to
call
on
the
dromores
while
they
were
being
ushered
in
he
heard
a
man
voice
rather
speaking
in
some
language
not
his
own
then
the
girl
no
no
oliver
il
y
a
toujours
un
qui
aime
et
qui
se
laisse
aimer
she
was
sitting
in
her
father
chair
and
on
the
they
saw
a
young
man
lolling
who
rose
and
stood
with
an
almost
insolent
expression
on
his
broad
face
lennan
scrutinized
him
with
he
might
be
rather
dandified
with
crisp
dark
hair
and
hazel
eyes
and
as
in
his
photograph
a
curious
look
of
daring
his
voice
when
he
vouchsafed
a
greeting
was
rather
high
and
not
unpleasant
with
a
touch
of
lazy
drawl
they
stayed
but
a
few
minutes
and
going
down
those
dimly
lighted
stairs
again
sylvia
remarked
how
prettily
she
said
if
she
were
putting
up
her
face
to
be
kissed
i
think
she
lovely
so
does
that
young
man
they
go
well
rather
abruptly
lennan
answered
ah
i
suppose
they
vi
she
came
to
them
often
after
that
sometimes
alone
twice
with
johnny
dromore
sometimes
with
young
oliver
who
under
sylvia
spell
soon
lost
his
air
and
the
statuette
was
begun
then
came
spring
in
earnest
and
that
real
business
of
racing
of
horses
the
flat
when
johnny
dromore
genius
was
no
longer
hampered
by
the
illegitimate
risks
of
he
came
to
dine
with
them
the
day
before
the
first
newmarket
meeting
he
had
a
soft
spot
for
sylvia
always
saying
to
lennan
as
he
went
away
charmin
wife
she
too
had
a
soft
spot
for
him
having
fathomed
the
utter
helplessness
of
this
worldling
wisdom
and
thinking
him
pathetic
after
he
was
gone
that
evening
she
said
ought
we
to
have
nell
to
stay
with
us
while
you
finishing
her
she
must
be
very
lonely
now
her
father
so
much
it
was
like
sylvia
to
think
of
that
but
would
it
be
pleasure
or
vexation
to
have
in
the
house
this
child
with
her
quaint
her
confiding
ways
and
those
eyes
in
truth
he
did
not
know
she
came
to
them
with
touching
like
a
dog
who
left
at
home
when
the
family
goes
for
a
holiday
takes
at
once
to
those
who
make
much
of
it
and
she
was
no
trouble
too
well
accustomed
to
amuse
herself
and
always
quaint
to
watch
with
her
continual
changes
from
child
to
woman
of
the
world
a
new
sensation
a
young
creature
in
the
house
both
he
and
sylvia
had
wanted
children
without
luck
twice
illness
had
stood
in
the
way
was
it
perhaps
just
that
little
lack
in
lack
of
poignancy
which
had
prevented
her
from
becoming
a
mother
an
only
child
herself
she
had
no
nieces
or
nephews
cicely
boys
had
always
been
at
school
and
now
were
out
in
the
world
yes
a
new
sensation
and
one
in
which
lennan
restless
feelings
seemed
to
merge
and
vanish
outside
the
hours
when
nell
sat
to
him
he
purposely
saw
but
little
of
her
leaving
her
to
nestle
under
sylvia
wing
and
this
she
did
as
if
she
never
wanted
to
come
out
thus
he
preserved
his
amusement
at
her
quaint
warmths
and
quainter
calmness
his
aesthetic
pleasure
in
watching
her
whose
strange
gaze
had
a
sort
of
dreamy
and
pathetic
lovingness
as
if
she
were
brimful
of
affections
that
had
no
outlet
every
morning
after
she
would
stay
an
hour
bent
over
her
own
drawing
which
made
practically
no
progress
and
he
would
often
catch
her
following
his
movements
with
those
great
eyes
of
hers
while
the
would
lie
perfectly
still
at
her
feet
blinking
was
her
attraction
his
birds
also
a
jackdaw
and
an
owl
who
had
the
run
of
the
studio
tolerated
her
as
they
tolerated
no
other
female
save
the
housekeeper
the
jackdaw
would
perch
on
her
and
peck
her
dress
but
the
owl
merely
engaged
her
in
combats
of
mesmeric
gazing
which
never
ended
in
victory
for
either
now
that
she
was
with
them
oliver
dromore
began
to
haunt
the
house
coming
at
all
hours
on
very
transparent
excuses
she
behaved
to
him
with
extreme
capriciousness
sometimes
hardly
speaking
sometimes
treating
him
like
a
brother
and
in
spite
of
all
his
nonchalance
the
poor
youth
would
just
sit
glowering
or
gazing
out
his
adoration
according
to
her
mood
one
of
these
july
evenings
lennan
remembered
beyond
all
others
he
had
come
after
a
hard
day
work
out
from
his
studio
into
the
courtyard
garden
to
smoke
a
cigarette
and
feel
the
sun
on
his
cheek
before
it
sank
behind
the
wall
a
far
away
was
grinding
out
a
waltz
and
on
an
hydrangea
tub
under
the
window
he
sat
down
to
listen
nothing
was
visible
from
there
save
just
the
square
patch
of
a
quite
blue
sky
and
one
soft
plume
of
smoke
from
his
own
kitchen
chimney
nothing
audible
save
that
tune
and
the
street
murmur
twice
birds
flew
it
was
very
peaceful
and
his
thoughts
went
floating
like
the
smoke
of
his
cigarette
to
meet
other
thoughts
no
doubt
had
little
swift
lives
of
their
own
desired
found
their
mates
and
lightly
blending
sent
forth
offspring
why
not
all
things
were
possible
in
this
of
a
world
even
that
waltz
tune
floating
away
would
find
some
melody
to
wed
and
twine
with
and
produce
a
fresh
chord
that
might
float
in
turn
to
catch
the
hum
of
a
gnat
or
fly
and
breed
again
everything
sought
to
entwine
with
something
else
on
one
of
the
pinkish
blooms
of
the
hydrangea
he
noted
a
all
things
in
this
garden
of
tiles
and
gravel
and
plants
in
tubs
the
little
furry
lonely
thing
was
drowsily
clinging
there
as
if
it
had
forgotten
what
it
had
come
maybe
like
himself
from
labour
by
these
last
rays
of
the
sun
its
wings
were
glistening
its
eyes
seemed
closed
and
the
played
on
a
tune
of
yearning
waiting
yearning
then
through
the
window
above
his
head
he
heard
oliver
voice
one
could
always
tell
pitched
high
with
its
slight
very
softly
at
first
then
insistent
imperious
and
suddenly
answering
voice
i
wo
oliver
i
wo
i
wo
he
rose
to
go
out
of
earshot
then
a
door
slammed
and
he
saw
her
at
the
window
above
him
her
waist
on
a
level
with
his
head
flushed
with
her
grey
eyes
ominously
bright
her
full
lips
parted
and
he
said
what
is
it
nell
she
leaned
down
and
caught
his
hand
her
touch
was
fiery
hot
he
kissed
me
i
wo
let
wo
kiss
him
through
his
head
went
a
medley
of
sayings
to
soothe
children
that
are
hurt
but
he
felt
unsteady
unlike
himself
and
suddenly
she
knelt
and
put
her
hot
forehead
against
his
lips
it
was
as
if
she
had
really
been
a
little
child
wanting
the
place
kissed
to
make
it
well
vii
after
that
strange
outburst
lennan
considered
long
whether
he
should
speak
to
oliver
but
what
could
he
say
from
what
standpoint
say
it
that
feeling
or
should
he
speak
to
dromore
not
very
easy
to
speak
on
such
a
subject
to
one
off
whose
turf
all
spiritual
matters
were
so
permanently
warned
nor
somehow
could
he
bring
himself
to
tell
sylvia
it
would
be
like
violating
a
confidence
to
speak
of
the
outburst
and
that
quivering
moment
when
she
had
kneeled
and
put
her
hot
forehead
to
his
lips
for
comfort
such
a
disclosure
was
for
nell
herself
to
make
if
she
so
wished
and
then
young
oliver
solved
the
difficulty
by
coming
to
the
studio
himself
next
day
he
entered
with
composure
very
well
groomed
in
a
silk
hat
a
black
coat
and
charming
gloves
what
indeed
the
youth
did
besides
belonging
to
the
yeomanry
and
hunting
all
the
winter
seemed
known
only
to
himself
he
made
no
excuse
for
interrupting
lennan
and
for
some
time
sat
silently
smoking
his
cigarette
and
pulling
the
ears
of
the
dogs
and
lennan
worked
on
waiting
there
was
always
something
attractive
to
him
in
this
young
man
broad
face
with
its
crisp
dark
hair
and
good
humour
now
so
clouded
at
last
oliver
got
up
and
went
over
to
the
unfinished
on
the
magpie
horse
turning
to
it
so
that
his
face
could
not
be
seen
he
said
you
and
lennan
have
been
awfully
kind
to
me
i
behaved
rather
like
a
cad
yesterday
i
thought
i
better
tell
you
i
want
to
marry
nell
you
lennan
was
glad
that
the
young
man
face
was
so
religiously
averted
he
let
his
hands
come
to
anchor
on
what
he
was
working
at
before
he
answered
she
only
a
child
oliver
and
then
watching
his
fingers
making
an
inept
movement
with
the
clay
was
astonished
at
himself
she
be
eighteen
this
month
he
heard
oliver
say
if
she
once
gets
do
know
what
i
shall
do
old
johnny
no
good
to
look
after
the
young
man
face
was
very
red
he
was
forgetting
to
hide
it
now
then
it
went
white
and
he
said
through
clenched
teeth
she
sends
me
mad
i
do
know
how
not
i
do
get
her
i
shall
shoot
myself
i
shall
you
that
sort
it
her
eyes
they
draw
you
right
out
of
leave
and
from
his
gloved
hand
the
fell
to
the
floor
they
say
her
mother
was
like
that
poor
old
johnny
think
i
got
a
chance
lennan
i
do
mean
now
this
minute
i
know
she
too
lennan
forced
himself
to
answer
i
dare
say
my
dear
fellow
i
dare
say
have
you
talked
with
my
wife
oliver
shook
his
head
she
so
do
think
she
quite
understand
my
sort
of
a
queer
little
smile
came
up
on
lennan
lips
ah
well
he
said
you
must
give
the
child
time
perhaps
when
she
comes
back
from
ireland
after
the
the
young
man
answered
moodily
yes
i
got
the
run
of
that
you
know
and
i
sha
be
able
to
keep
he
took
up
his
hat
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
come
and
bored
you
about
this
but
nell
thinks
such
a
lot
of
you
and
you
being
different
to
most
thought
you
would
he
turned
again
at
the
door
it
was
gas
what
i
said
just
not
getting
her
fellows
say
that
sort
of
thing
but
i
mean
he
put
on
that
shining
hat
and
went
and
lennan
stood
staring
at
the
statuette
so
passion
broke
down
even
the
defences
of
dromoredom
passion
strange
hearts
it
chose
to
bloom
in
different
to
most
thought
you
would
mind
how
had
this
youth
known
that
sylvia
would
not
understand
passion
so
out
of
hand
as
this
and
what
had
made
it
clear
that
he
lennan
would
was
there
then
something
in
his
face
there
must
be
even
johnny
reticent
of
confided
to
him
that
one
hour
of
his
astute
existence
when
the
wind
had
swept
him
out
to
sea
yes
and
that
statuette
would
never
be
any
good
try
as
he
might
oliver
was
was
her
eyes
how
they
had
their
childish
eyes
could
be
said
to
smoke
and
how
they
had
drawn
and
pleaded
when
she
put
her
face
to
his
in
her
still
more
childish
entreaty
if
they
were
like
this
now
what
would
they
be
when
the
woman
in
her
woke
just
as
well
not
to
think
of
her
too
much
just
as
well
to
work
and
take
heed
that
he
would
soon
be
just
as
well
that
next
week
she
would
be
gone
to
ireland
and
the
last
evening
before
she
went
they
took
her
to
see
carmen
at
the
opera
he
remembered
that
she
wore
a
nearly
high
white
frock
and
a
dark
carnation
in
the
ribbon
tying
her
crinkly
hair
that
still
hung
loose
how
wonderfully
entranced
she
sat
drunk
on
that
opera
that
he
had
seen
a
score
of
times
now
touching
his
arm
now
sylvia
whispering
questions
who
that
what
coming
now
the
carmen
roused
her
to
adoration
but
don
jose
was
fat
in
his
funny
little
coat
till
in
the
maddened
jealousy
of
the
last
act
he
rose
superior
then
quite
lost
in
excitement
she
clutched
lennan
arm
and
her
gasp
when
carmen
at
last
fell
dead
made
all
their
neighbours
jump
her
emotion
was
far
more
moving
than
that
on
the
stage
he
wanted
badly
to
stroke
and
comfort
her
and
say
there
there
my
dear
it
only
and
when
it
was
over
and
the
excellent
murdered
lady
and
her
poor
fat
little
lover
appeared
before
the
curtain
finally
forgetting
that
she
was
a
woman
of
the
world
she
started
forward
in
her
seat
and
clapped
and
clapped
fortunate
that
johnny
dromore
was
not
there
to
see
but
all
things
coming
to
an
end
they
had
to
get
up
and
go
and
as
they
made
their
way
out
to
the
hall
lennan
felt
a
hot
little
finger
crooked
into
his
own
as
if
she
simply
must
have
something
to
squeeze
he
really
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
she
seemed
to
feel
this
soon
letting
it
go
all
the
way
home
in
the
cab
she
was
silent
with
that
same
abstraction
she
ate
her
sandwiches
and
drank
her
lemonade
took
sylvia
kiss
and
quite
a
woman
of
the
world
once
more
begged
that
they
would
not
get
up
to
see
her
she
was
to
go
at
seven
in
the
morning
to
catch
the
irish
mail
then
holding
out
her
hand
to
lennan
she
very
gravely
said
thanks
most
awfully
for
taking
me
he
stayed
full
half
an
hour
at
the
window
smoking
no
street
lamp
shone
just
there
and
the
night
was
velvety
black
above
the
at
last
with
a
sigh
he
shut
up
and
went
upstairs
in
darkness
suddenly
in
the
corridor
the
white
wall
seemed
to
move
at
him
a
warmth
a
fragrance
a
sound
like
a
tiny
sigh
and
something
soft
was
squeezed
into
his
hand
then
the
wall
moved
back
and
he
stood
sound
no
anything
but
in
his
he
looked
at
the
soft
thing
in
his
hand
it
was
the
carnation
from
her
hair
what
had
possessed
the
child
to
give
him
that
carmen
ah
carmen
and
gazing
at
the
flower
he
held
it
away
from
him
with
a
sort
of
terror
but
its
scent
arose
and
suddenly
he
thrust
it
all
fresh
as
it
was
into
a
and
held
it
burning
writhing
till
it
blackened
to
velvet
then
his
heart
smote
him
for
so
cruel
a
deed
it
was
still
beautiful
but
its
scent
was
gone
and
turning
to
the
window
he
flung
it
far
out
into
the
darkness
viii
now
that
she
was
gone
it
was
curious
how
little
they
spoke
of
her
considering
how
long
she
had
been
with
them
and
they
had
from
her
but
one
letter
written
to
sylvia
very
soon
after
she
left
ending
dad
sends
his
best
respects
please
and
with
my
love
to
you
and
lennan
and
all
the
oliver
is
coming
here
next
week
we
are
going
to
some
it
was
difficult
of
course
to
speak
of
her
with
that
episode
of
the
flower
too
bizarre
to
be
sort
of
thing
sylvia
would
see
out
of
all
indeed
any
woman
might
had
it
really
been
but
the
uncontrolled
impulse
of
an
emotional
child
longing
to
express
feelings
kindled
by
the
excitement
of
that
opera
what
but
a
feathery
warmth
one
of
those
flying
peeps
at
the
mystery
of
passion
that
young
things
take
he
could
not
give
away
that
pretty
foolishness
and
because
he
would
not
give
it
away
he
was
more
than
usually
affectionate
to
sylvia
they
had
made
no
holiday
plans
and
he
eagerly
fell
in
with
her
suggestion
that
they
should
go
down
to
hayle
there
if
anywhere
this
curious
restlessness
would
leave
him
they
had
not
been
down
to
the
old
place
for
many
years
indeed
since
gordy
death
it
was
generally
let
they
left
london
late
in
august
the
day
was
closing
in
when
they
arrived
honeysuckle
had
long
been
improved
away
from
that
station
paling
against
which
he
had
stood
years
ago
watching
the
train
carrying
anna
stormer
away
in
the
hired
fly
sylvia
pressed
close
to
him
and
held
his
hand
beneath
the
ancient
both
felt
the
same
excitement
at
seeing
again
this
old
home
not
a
single
soul
of
the
past
days
would
be
there
the
house
and
the
trees
the
owls
and
the
stars
the
river
park
and
logan
stone
it
was
dark
when
they
arrived
just
their
bedroom
and
two
had
been
made
ready
with
fires
burning
though
it
was
still
high
summer
the
same
old
execrable
heatherleys
looked
down
from
the
black
oak
panellings
the
same
scent
of
apples
and
old
mice
clung
here
and
there
about
the
dark
corridors
with
their
unexpected
stairways
it
was
all
curiously
unchanged
as
old
houses
are
when
they
are
let
furnished
once
in
the
night
he
woke
through
the
uncurtained
windows
the
night
was
simply
alive
with
stars
such
swarms
of
them
swinging
and
trembling
up
there
and
far
away
rose
the
melancholy
hooting
of
an
owl
sylvia
voice
close
to
him
said
mark
that
night
when
your
star
caught
in
my
hair
do
you
remember
yes
he
remembered
and
in
his
drowsy
mind
just
roused
from
dreams
there
turned
and
turned
the
queer
nonsensical
refrain
i
desert
micawber
a
pleasant
month
reading
and
walking
with
the
dogs
the
country
round
of
lying
out
long
hours
amongst
the
boulders
or
along
the
river
banks
watching
beasts
and
birds
the
little
old
temple
of
his
early
masterpieces
was
still
extant
used
now
to
protect
watering
pots
but
no
vestige
of
impulse
towards
work
came
to
him
down
there
he
was
marking
time
not
restless
not
bored
just
for
what
he
had
no
notion
and
sylvia
at
any
rate
was
happy
blooming
in
these
old
haunts
losing
her
fairness
in
the
sun
even
taking
again
to
a
sunbonnet
which
made
her
look
extraordinarily
young
the
trout
that
poor
old
gordy
had
so
harried
were
left
undisturbed
no
gun
was
fired
rabbits
pigeons
even
the
few
partridges
enjoyed
those
first
days
of
autumn
unmolested
the
bracken
and
leaves
turned
very
early
so
that
the
park
in
the
hazy
september
sunlight
had
an
almost
golden
hue
a
gentle
mellowness
reigned
over
all
that
holiday
and
from
ireland
came
no
further
news
save
one
picture
postcard
with
the
words
this
is
our
in
the
last
week
of
september
they
went
back
to
london
and
at
once
there
began
in
him
again
that
restless
unreasonable
sense
of
being
drawn
away
out
of
himself
so
that
he
once
more
took
to
walking
the
park
for
hours
over
grass
already
strewn
with
leaves
always
for
what
at
dromore
the
confidential
man
did
not
know
when
his
master
would
be
back
he
had
gone
to
scotland
with
miss
nell
after
the
leger
was
lennan
disappointed
not
rather
but
his
ache
was
there
all
the
time
feeding
on
its
secrecy
and
loneliness
unmentionable
feeling
that
it
was
why
had
he
not
realized
long
ago
that
youth
was
over
passion
done
with
autumn
upon
him
how
never
grasped
the
fact
that
steals
away
and
as
before
the
only
refuge
was
in
work
the
and
girl
on
the
magpie
horse
were
finished
he
began
a
fantastic
nymph
peering
from
behind
a
rock
and
a
man
creeping
through
reeds
towards
her
if
he
could
put
into
the
nymph
face
something
of
this
lure
of
youth
and
life
and
love
that
was
dragging
at
him
into
the
man
face
the
state
of
his
own
heart
it
might
lay
that
feeling
to
rest
anything
to
get
it
out
of
himself
and
he
worked
furiously
laboriously
all
october
making
no
great
progress
what
could
he
expect
when
life
was
all
the
time
knocking
with
that
muffled
tapping
at
his
door
it
was
on
the
tuesday
after
the
close
of
the
last
newmarket
meeting
and
just
getting
dusk
when
life
opened
the
door
and
walked
in
she
wore
a
dress
a
new
one
and
surely
her
very
different
from
what
he
had
remembered
they
had
quickened
and
become
poignant
she
was
no
longer
a
was
at
once
plain
cheeks
mouth
neck
seemed
fined
shaped
the
crinkly
hair
was
coiled
up
now
under
a
velvet
cap
only
the
great
grey
eyes
seemed
quite
the
same
and
at
sight
of
her
his
heart
gave
a
sort
of
dive
and
flight
as
if
all
its
vague
and
wistful
sensations
had
found
their
goal
then
in
sudden
agitation
he
realized
that
his
last
moment
with
this
a
child
no
been
a
secret
moment
of
warmth
and
of
emotion
a
moment
which
to
her
might
have
meant
in
her
might
have
bred
feelings
that
he
had
no
inkling
of
he
tried
to
ignore
that
fighting
and
diving
of
his
heart
held
out
his
hand
and
murmured
ah
nell
back
at
last
you
then
with
a
sensation
of
every
limb
gone
weak
he
felt
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
herself
pressed
against
him
there
was
time
for
the
thought
to
flash
through
him
this
is
terrible
he
gave
her
a
little
convulsive
a
man
do
less
just
managed
to
push
her
gently
away
trying
with
all
his
might
to
think
she
a
child
it
nothing
more
than
after
carmen
she
does
know
what
i
am
feeling
but
he
was
conscious
of
a
mad
desire
to
clutch
her
to
him
the
touch
of
her
had
demolished
all
his
vagueness
made
things
only
too
plain
set
him
on
fire
he
said
uncertainly
come
to
the
fire
my
child
and
tell
me
all
about
if
he
did
not
keep
to
the
notion
that
she
was
just
a
child
his
head
would
go
lost
one
a
good
name
for
her
indeed
as
she
stood
there
her
eyes
shining
in
the
mesmeric
than
ever
they
had
been
and
to
get
away
from
the
lure
of
those
eyes
he
bent
down
and
raked
the
grate
saying
have
you
seen
sylvia
but
he
knew
that
she
had
not
even
before
she
gave
that
impatient
shrug
then
he
pulled
himself
together
and
said
what
has
happened
to
you
child
i
not
a
no
we
both
grown
older
i
was
the
other
she
caught
his
how
supple
she
was
murmured
you
not
old
a
bit
you
quite
at
his
wits
end
with
his
heart
thumping
but
still
keeping
his
eyes
away
from
her
he
said
where
is
oliver
she
dropped
his
hand
at
that
oliver
i
hate
him
afraid
to
trust
himself
near
her
he
had
begun
walking
up
and
down
and
she
stood
following
him
with
her
firelight
playing
on
her
red
frock
what
extraordinary
stillness
what
power
she
had
developed
in
these
few
months
had
he
let
her
see
that
he
felt
that
power
and
had
all
this
come
of
one
little
moment
in
a
dark
corridor
of
one
flower
pressed
into
his
hand
why
had
he
not
spoken
to
her
roughly
her
she
was
a
romantic
little
fool
god
knew
what
thoughts
she
had
been
feeding
on
but
who
could
have
and
again
he
fixed
his
mind
resolutely
on
that
thought
she
a
a
child
come
he
said
tell
me
all
about
your
time
in
ireland
oh
it
was
just
all
been
dull
away
from
it
came
out
without
hesitancy
or
shame
and
he
could
only
murmur
ah
you
missed
your
drawing
yes
can
i
come
that
was
the
moment
to
have
said
no
you
are
a
foolish
child
and
i
an
elderly
idiot
but
he
had
neither
courage
nor
clearness
of
mind
enough
desire
and
without
answering
he
went
towards
the
door
to
turn
up
the
light
oh
no
please
do
it
so
nice
like
this
the
shadowy
room
the
bluish
dusk
painted
on
all
the
windows
the
fitful
shining
of
the
fire
the
pallor
and
darkness
of
the
dim
casts
and
bronzes
and
that
one
glowing
figure
there
before
the
hearth
and
her
voice
a
little
piteous
went
on
are
you
glad
i
back
i
ca
see
you
properly
out
he
went
back
into
the
glow
and
she
gave
a
little
sigh
of
satisfaction
then
her
calm
young
voice
said
ever
so
distinctly
oliver
wants
me
to
marry
him
and
i
wo
of
he
dared
not
say
why
not
he
dared
not
say
anything
it
was
too
dangerous
and
then
followed
those
amazing
words
you
know
why
you
of
course
you
it
was
ridiculous
almost
shameful
to
understand
their
meaning
and
he
stood
staring
in
front
of
him
without
a
word
humility
dismay
pride
and
a
sort
of
mad
exultation
all
mixed
and
seething
within
him
in
the
queerest
pudding
of
emotion
but
all
he
said
was
come
my
child
we
neither
of
us
quite
ourselves
let
go
to
the
ix
back
in
the
darkness
and
solitude
of
the
studio
when
she
was
gone
he
sat
down
before
the
fire
his
senses
in
a
whirl
why
was
he
not
just
an
ordinary
animal
of
a
man
that
could
enjoy
what
the
gods
had
sent
it
was
as
if
on
a
november
day
someone
had
pulled
aside
the
sober
curtains
of
the
sky
and
there
in
a
chink
had
been
april
white
blossom
a
purple
cloud
a
rainbow
grass
vivid
green
light
flaring
from
one
knew
not
where
and
such
a
tingling
passion
of
life
on
it
all
as
made
the
heart
stand
still
this
then
was
the
marvellous
enchanting
maddening
end
of
all
that
year
of
restlessness
and
wanting
this
bit
of
spring
suddenly
given
to
him
in
the
midst
of
autumn
her
lips
her
eyes
her
hair
her
touching
confidence
above
love
not
really
love
perhaps
just
childish
fancy
but
on
the
wings
of
fancy
this
child
would
fly
far
too
wistfulness
and
warmth
beneath
that
light
veneer
of
absurd
composure
to
live
plunge
back
into
youth
and
feel
spring
once
lose
the
sense
of
all
being
over
save
just
the
sober
jogtrot
of
domestic
bliss
to
know
actually
to
know
ecstasy
again
in
the
love
of
a
girl
to
rediscover
all
that
youth
yearns
for
and
feels
and
hopes
and
dreads
and
loves
it
was
a
prospect
to
turn
the
head
even
of
a
decent
man
by
just
closing
his
eyes
he
could
see
her
standing
there
with
the
firelight
glow
on
her
red
frock
could
feel
again
that
marvellous
thrill
when
she
pressed
herself
against
him
in
the
seducing
moment
when
she
first
came
in
could
feel
again
her
eyes
him
she
was
a
witch
a
unto
her
love
of
red
she
had
the
witch
power
of
lighting
fever
in
the
veins
and
he
simply
wondered
at
himself
that
he
had
not
as
she
stood
there
in
the
firelight
knelt
and
put
his
arms
round
her
and
pressed
his
face
against
her
waist
why
had
he
not
but
he
did
not
want
to
think
the
moment
thought
began
he
knew
he
must
be
torn
this
way
and
that
tossed
here
and
there
between
reason
and
desire
pity
and
passion
every
sense
struggled
to
keep
him
wrapped
in
the
warmth
and
intoxication
of
this
discovery
that
he
in
the
full
of
autumn
had
awakened
love
in
spring
it
was
amazing
that
she
could
have
this
feeling
yet
there
was
no
mistake
her
manner
to
sylvia
just
now
had
been
almost
dangerously
changed
there
had
been
a
queer
cold
impatience
in
her
look
frightening
from
one
who
but
three
months
ago
had
been
so
affectionate
and
going
away
she
had
whispered
with
that
old
at
him
as
if
offering
to
be
kissed
i
may
come
may
i
and
do
be
angry
with
me
please
i
ca
help
a
monstrous
thing
at
his
age
to
let
a
young
girl
love
her
future
a
monstrous
thing
by
all
the
canons
of
virtue
and
gentility
and
future
that
that
father
and
that
home
but
he
would
must
not
think
nevertheless
he
showed
the
signs
of
thought
and
badly
for
after
dinner
sylvia
putting
her
hand
on
his
forehead
said
you
working
too
hard
mark
you
do
go
out
he
held
those
fingers
fast
sylvia
no
indeed
he
must
not
think
but
he
took
advantage
of
her
words
and
said
that
he
would
go
out
and
get
some
air
he
walked
at
a
great
keep
thought
he
reached
the
river
close
to
westminster
and
moved
by
sudden
impulse
seeking
perhaps
an
antidote
turned
down
into
that
little
street
under
the
big
wren
church
where
he
had
never
been
since
the
summer
night
when
he
lost
what
was
then
more
to
him
than
life
there
she
had
lived
there
was
the
windows
which
he
had
stolen
past
and
gazed
at
with
such
distress
and
longing
who
lived
there
now
once
more
he
seemed
to
see
that
face
out
of
the
past
the
dark
hair
and
dark
soft
eyes
and
sweet
gravity
and
it
did
not
reproach
him
for
this
new
feeling
was
not
a
love
like
that
had
been
only
once
could
a
man
feel
the
love
that
passed
all
things
the
love
before
which
the
world
was
but
a
spark
in
a
draught
of
wind
the
love
that
whatever
dishonour
grief
and
unrest
it
might
come
through
alone
had
in
it
the
heart
of
peace
and
joy
and
honour
fate
had
torn
that
love
from
him
nipped
it
off
as
a
sharp
wind
nips
off
a
perfect
flower
this
new
feeling
was
but
a
fever
a
passionate
fancy
a
grasping
once
more
at
youth
and
warmth
ah
well
but
it
was
real
enough
and
in
one
of
those
moments
when
a
man
stands
outside
himself
seems
to
be
lifted
away
and
see
his
own
life
twirling
lennan
had
a
vision
of
a
shadow
driven
here
and
there
a
straw
going
round
and
round
a
midge
in
the
grip
of
a
mad
wind
where
was
the
home
of
this
mighty
secret
feeling
that
sprang
so
suddenly
out
of
the
dark
and
caught
you
by
the
throat
why
did
it
come
now
and
not
then
for
this
one
and
not
that
other
what
did
man
know
of
it
save
that
it
made
him
spin
and
a
moth
intoxicated
by
a
light
or
a
bee
by
some
dark
sweet
flower
save
that
it
made
of
him
a
distraught
humble
eager
puppet
of
its
fancy
had
it
not
once
already
driven
him
even
to
the
edge
of
death
and
must
it
now
come
on
him
again
with
its
sweet
madness
its
drugging
scent
what
was
it
why
was
it
why
these
passionate
obsessions
that
could
not
decently
be
satisfied
had
civilization
so
outstripped
man
that
his
nature
was
cramped
into
shoes
too
the
feet
of
a
chinese
woman
what
was
it
why
was
it
and
faster
than
ever
he
walked
away
pall
mall
brought
him
back
to
that
counterfeit
presentment
of
the
there
in
james
street
was
johnny
dromore
club
and
again
moved
by
impulse
he
pushed
open
its
swing
door
no
need
to
ask
for
there
was
dromore
in
the
hall
on
his
way
from
dinner
to
the
the
glossy
tan
of
hard
exercise
and
good
living
lay
on
his
cheeks
as
thick
as
clouted
cream
his
eyes
had
the
peculiar
shine
of
superabundant
vigour
a
certain
air
in
face
and
voice
and
movements
suggested
that
he
was
going
to
make
a
night
of
it
and
the
sardonic
thought
flashed
through
lennan
shall
i
tell
him
hallo
old
chap
awfully
glad
to
see
you
what
you
doin
with
yourself
workin
hard
how
your
wife
you
been
away
been
doin
anything
great
and
then
the
question
that
would
have
given
him
his
chance
if
he
had
liked
to
be
so
cruel
seen
nell
yes
she
came
round
this
what
think
of
her
comin
on
nicely
is
she
that
old
query
half
furtive
and
half
proud
as
much
as
to
say
know
she
not
in
the
but
it
i
sired
her
and
then
the
old
sudden
gloom
which
lasted
but
a
second
and
gave
way
again
to
chaff
lennan
stayed
very
few
minutes
never
had
he
felt
farther
from
his
old
no
whatever
happened
johnny
dromore
must
be
left
out
it
was
a
position
he
had
earned
with
his
goggling
eyes
and
his
astute
philosophy
from
it
he
should
not
be
disturbed
he
passed
along
the
railings
of
the
green
park
on
the
cold
air
of
this
last
october
night
a
thin
haze
hung
and
the
acrid
fragrance
from
little
bonfires
of
fallen
leaves
what
was
there
about
that
scent
of
smoke
that
had
always
moved
him
so
symbol
of
parting
most
mournful
thing
in
all
the
world
for
what
would
even
death
be
but
for
parting
sweet
long
sleep
or
new
adventure
but
if
a
man
loved
leave
them
or
be
left
ah
and
it
was
not
death
only
that
brought
partings
he
came
to
the
opening
of
the
street
where
dromore
lived
she
would
be
there
sitting
by
the
fire
in
the
big
chair
playing
with
her
kitten
thinking
dreaming
he
passed
on
at
such
a
pace
that
people
stared
till
turning
the
last
corner
for
home
he
ran
almost
into
the
arms
of
oliver
dromore
the
young
man
was
walking
with
unaccustomed
indecision
his
fur
coat
open
his
pushed
up
on
his
crisp
hair
dark
under
the
eyes
he
had
not
the
proper
gloss
of
a
dromore
at
this
season
of
the
year
mr
lennan
i
just
been
round
to
and
lennan
answered
dazedly
will
you
come
in
or
shall
i
walk
your
way
a
bit
i
here
if
you
do
so
in
silence
they
went
back
into
the
square
and
oliver
said
let
get
over
by
the
they
crossed
to
the
railings
of
the
square
dark
garden
where
nobody
was
passing
and
with
every
step
lennan
humiliation
grew
there
was
something
false
and
undignified
in
walking
with
this
young
man
who
had
once
treated
him
as
a
father
confessor
to
his
love
for
nell
and
suddenly
he
perceived
that
they
had
made
a
complete
circuit
of
the
square
garden
without
speaking
a
single
word
yes
he
said
oliver
turned
his
face
away
you
remember
what
i
told
you
in
the
summer
well
it
worse
now
been
going
a
mucker
lately
in
all
sorts
of
ways
to
try
and
get
rid
of
it
but
it
all
no
good
she
got
me
and
lennan
thought
you
not
alone
in
that
but
he
kept
silence
his
chief
dread
was
of
saying
something
that
he
would
remember
afterwards
as
the
words
of
judas
then
oliver
suddenly
burst
out
why
ca
she
care
i
suppose
i
nothing
much
but
she
known
me
all
her
life
and
she
used
to
like
me
there
ca
make
out
could
you
do
anything
for
me
with
her
lennan
pointed
across
the
street
in
every
other
one
of
those
houses
oliver
he
said
there
probably
some
creature
who
ca
make
out
why
another
creature
does
care
passion
comes
when
it
will
goes
when
it
will
and
we
poor
devils
have
no
say
in
what
do
you
advise
me
then
lennan
had
an
almost
overwhelming
impulse
to
turn
on
his
heel
and
leave
the
young
man
standing
there
but
he
forced
himself
to
look
at
his
face
which
even
then
had
its
more
so
than
ever
so
pallid
and
desperate
it
was
and
he
said
slowly
staring
mentally
at
every
word
i
not
up
to
giving
you
advice
the
only
thing
i
might
say
is
one
does
not
press
oneself
where
one
is
wanted
all
the
knows
so
long
as
she
feels
you
there
waiting
she
might
turn
to
you
at
any
moment
the
more
chivalrous
you
are
oliver
the
more
patiently
you
wait
the
better
chance
you
oliver
took
those
words
of
little
comfort
without
flinching
i
see
he
said
thanks
but
my
god
it
hard
i
never
could
and
with
that
epigram
on
himself
holding
out
his
hand
he
turned
away
lennan
went
slowly
home
trying
to
gauge
exactly
how
anyone
who
knew
all
would
judge
him
it
was
a
little
difficult
in
this
affair
to
keep
a
shred
of
dignity
sylvia
had
not
gone
up
and
he
saw
her
looking
at
him
anxiously
the
one
strange
comfort
in
all
this
was
that
his
feeling
for
her
at
any
rate
had
not
changed
it
seemed
even
to
have
be
more
real
to
him
how
could
he
help
staying
awake
that
night
how
could
he
help
thinking
then
and
long
time
he
lay
staring
at
the
dark
as
if
thinking
were
any
good
for
fever
in
the
veins
x
passion
never
plays
the
game
it
at
all
events
is
free
from
and
pride
from
dignity
nerves
scruples
cant
moralities
from
hypocrisies
and
wisdom
and
fears
for
pocket
and
position
in
this
world
and
the
next
well
did
the
old
painters
limn
it
as
an
arrow
or
a
wind
if
it
had
not
been
as
swift
and
darting
earth
must
long
ago
have
drifted
through
space
let
after
that
fevered
night
lennan
went
to
his
studio
at
the
usual
hour
and
naturally
did
not
do
a
stroke
of
work
he
was
even
obliged
to
send
away
his
model
the
fellow
had
been
his
hairdresser
but
getting
ill
and
falling
on
dark
days
one
morning
had
come
to
the
studio
to
ask
with
manifest
shame
if
his
head
were
any
good
after
having
tested
his
capacity
for
standing
still
and
giving
him
some
introductions
lennan
had
noted
him
down
five
feet
nine
good
hair
lean
face
something
tortured
and
pathetic
give
him
a
turn
if
the
turn
had
come
and
the
poor
man
was
posing
in
a
painful
attitude
talking
whenever
permitted
of
the
way
things
had
treated
him
and
the
delights
of
cutting
hair
this
morning
he
took
his
departure
with
the
simple
pleasure
of
one
fully
paid
for
services
not
rendered
and
so
walking
up
and
down
up
and
down
the
sculptor
waited
for
knock
what
would
happen
now
thinking
had
made
nothing
clear
here
was
offered
what
every
man
whose
spring
is
past
and
beauty
and
in
that
youth
a
renewal
of
his
own
what
all
men
save
hypocrites
and
englishmen
would
even
admit
that
they
desired
and
it
was
offered
to
one
who
had
neither
religious
nor
moral
scruples
as
they
are
commonly
understood
in
theory
he
could
accept
in
practice
he
did
not
as
yet
know
what
he
could
do
one
thing
only
he
had
discovered
during
the
night
reflections
that
those
who
scouted
belief
in
the
principle
of
liberty
made
no
greater
mistake
than
to
suppose
that
liberty
was
dangerous
because
it
made
a
man
a
libertine
to
those
with
any
decency
the
creed
of
freedom
most
enchaining
easy
enough
to
break
chains
imposed
by
others
fling
his
cap
over
the
windmill
and
cry
for
the
moment
at
least
i
am
unfettered
free
hard
indeed
to
say
the
same
to
his
own
unfettered
self
yes
his
own
self
was
in
the
by
his
own
verdict
and
decision
he
must
abide
and
though
he
ached
for
the
sight
of
her
and
his
will
seemed
times
already
he
had
thought
it
wo
do
god
help
me
then
twelve
had
come
and
she
had
not
would
girl
on
the
magpie
horse
be
all
he
would
see
of
her
unsatisfying
work
so
cold
and
devoid
of
witchery
better
have
tried
to
paint
a
red
flower
in
her
hair
a
pout
on
her
lips
and
her
eyes
fey
or
languorous
goya
could
have
painted
her
and
then
just
as
he
had
given
her
up
she
came
after
taking
one
look
at
his
face
she
slipped
in
ever
so
quietly
like
a
very
good
child
marvellous
the
instinct
and
finesse
of
the
young
when
they
are
women
not
a
vestige
in
her
of
yesterday
seductive
power
not
a
sign
that
there
had
been
a
yesterday
at
confiding
like
a
daughter
sitting
there
telling
him
about
ireland
showing
him
the
little
batch
of
drawings
she
had
done
while
she
was
away
had
she
brought
them
because
she
knew
they
would
make
him
feel
sorry
for
her
what
could
have
been
less
dangerous
more
appealing
to
the
protective
and
paternal
side
of
him
than
she
was
that
morning
as
if
she
only
wanted
what
her
father
and
her
home
could
not
give
wanted
to
be
a
sort
of
daughter
to
him
she
went
away
demurely
as
she
had
come
refusing
to
stay
to
lunch
manifestly
avoiding
sylvia
only
then
he
realized
that
she
must
have
taken
alarm
from
the
look
of
strain
on
his
face
been
afraid
that
he
would
send
her
away
only
then
perceived
that
with
her
appeal
to
his
protection
she
had
been
binding
him
closer
making
it
harder
for
him
to
break
away
and
hurt
her
and
the
fevered
aching
began
than
moment
he
lost
sight
of
her
and
more
than
ever
he
felt
in
the
grip
of
something
beyond
his
power
to
fight
against
something
that
however
he
swerved
and
backed
and
broke
away
would
close
in
on
him
find
means
to
bind
him
again
hand
and
foot
in
the
afternoon
dromore
confidential
man
brought
him
a
note
the
fellow
with
his
eyes
and
his
hair
seemed
to
lennan
to
be
saying
yes
is
quite
natural
that
you
should
take
the
note
out
of
eyeshot
i
know
fortunately
there
is
no
necessity
for
am
strictly
and
this
was
what
the
note
contained
you
promised
to
ride
with
me
did
promise
and
you
never
have
do
please
ride
with
me
then
you
will
get
what
you
want
for
the
statuette
instead
of
being
so
cross
with
it
you
can
have
dad
has
gone
to
newmarket
again
and
i
so
lonely
at
from
here
to
hesitate
in
view
of
those
confidential
eyes
was
not
possible
it
must
be
or
and
if
it
would
only
mean
that
she
would
come
in
the
morning
instead
so
he
said
just
say
right
very
good
then
from
the
door
mr
dromore
will
be
away
till
saturday
now
why
had
the
fellow
said
that
curious
how
this
desperate
secret
feeling
of
his
own
made
him
see
sinister
meaning
in
this
servant
in
oliver
visit
of
last
everything
it
was
suspiciousness
he
could
feel
almost
see
himself
deteriorating
already
with
this
furtive
feeling
in
his
soul
it
would
soon
be
written
on
his
face
but
what
was
the
use
of
troubling
what
would
come
way
or
the
other
and
suddenly
he
remembered
with
a
shock
that
it
was
the
first
of
birthday
he
had
never
before
forgotten
it
in
the
disturbance
of
that
discovery
he
was
very
near
to
going
and
pouring
out
to
her
the
whole
story
of
his
feelings
a
charming
birthday
present
that
would
make
taking
his
hat
instead
he
dashed
round
to
the
nearest
flower
shop
a
frenchwoman
kept
it
what
had
she
what
did
monsieur
desire
des
oeillets
rouges
ai
de
bien
beaux
ce
those
white
flowers
une
belle
azalee
yes
that
would
be
sent
at
once
next
door
was
a
jeweller
he
had
never
really
known
if
sylvia
cared
for
jewels
since
one
day
he
happened
to
remark
that
they
were
vulgar
and
feeling
that
he
had
fallen
low
indeed
to
be
trying
to
atone
with
some
miserable
gewgaw
for
never
having
thought
of
her
all
day
because
he
had
been
thinking
of
another
he
went
in
and
bought
the
only
ornament
whose
ingredients
did
not
make
his
gorge
rise
two
small
black
pearls
one
at
each
end
of
a
fine
platinum
chain
coming
out
with
it
he
noticed
over
the
street
in
a
clear
sky
fast
deepening
to
indigo
the
thinnest
slip
of
a
new
moon
like
a
bright
swallow
with
wings
bent
back
flying
towards
the
ground
that
weather
if
it
could
only
be
fine
weather
in
his
heart
and
in
order
that
the
azalea
might
arrive
first
he
walked
up
and
down
the
square
which
he
and
oliver
had
patrolled
the
night
before
when
he
went
in
sylvia
was
just
placing
the
white
azalea
in
the
window
of
the
and
stealing
up
behind
her
he
clasped
the
little
necklet
round
her
throat
she
turned
round
and
clung
to
him
he
could
feel
that
she
was
greatly
moved
and
remorse
stirred
and
stirred
in
him
that
he
was
betraying
her
with
his
kiss
but
even
while
he
kissed
her
he
was
hardening
his
heart
xi
next
day
still
following
the
lead
of
her
words
about
fresh
air
and
his
tired
look
he
told
her
that
he
was
going
to
ride
and
did
not
say
with
whom
after
applauding
his
resolution
she
was
silent
for
a
asked
why
do
you
ride
with
nell
he
had
already
so
lost
his
dignity
that
he
hardly
felt
disgraced
in
answering
it
might
bore
her
oh
no
it
would
bore
had
she
meant
anything
by
that
and
feeling
as
if
he
were
fencing
with
his
own
soul
he
said
very
well
i
he
had
perceived
suddenly
that
he
did
not
know
his
wife
having
always
till
now
believed
that
it
was
she
who
did
not
quite
know
him
if
she
had
not
been
out
at
he
would
have
lunched
out
of
his
own
face
for
feverishness
in
sick
persons
mounts
steadily
with
the
approach
of
a
certain
hour
and
surely
his
face
to
anyone
who
could
have
seen
him
being
conveyed
to
piccadilly
would
have
suggested
a
fevered
invalid
rather
than
a
healthy
sculptor
in
a
cab
the
horses
were
before
the
little
magpie
horse
and
a
thoroughbred
bay
mare
weeded
from
dromore
racing
stable
nell
too
was
standing
ready
her
cheeks
very
pink
and
her
eyes
very
bright
she
did
not
wait
for
him
to
mount
her
but
took
the
aid
of
the
confidential
man
what
was
it
that
made
her
look
so
perfect
on
that
little
of
limb
or
something
soft
and
fiery
in
her
spirit
that
the
little
creature
knew
of
they
started
in
silence
but
as
soon
as
the
sound
of
hoofs
died
on
the
tan
of
rotten
row
she
turned
to
him
it
was
lovely
of
you
to
come
i
thought
you
be
are
afraid
of
and
lennan
thought
you
right
but
please
do
look
like
yesterday
too
heavenly
oh
i
love
beautiful
days
and
i
love
riding
she
broke
off
and
looked
at
him
ca
you
just
be
nice
to
seemed
to
be
love
me
as
you
ought
that
was
her
conviction
that
he
did
and
ought
to
love
her
that
she
ought
to
and
did
love
him
how
simple
but
riding
too
is
a
simple
passion
and
simple
passions
distract
each
other
it
was
a
treat
to
be
on
that
bay
mare
who
so
to
be
trusted
to
ride
the
best
as
johnny
dromore
at
the
far
end
of
the
row
she
cried
out
let
go
on
to
richmond
now
and
trotted
off
into
the
road
as
if
she
knew
she
could
do
with
him
what
she
wished
and
following
meekly
he
asked
himself
why
what
was
there
in
her
to
make
up
to
him
for
all
that
he
was
power
of
work
his
dignity
his
what
was
there
just
those
eyes
and
lips
and
hair
and
as
if
she
knew
what
he
was
thinking
she
looked
round
and
smiled
so
they
jogged
on
over
the
bridge
and
across
barnes
common
into
richmond
park
but
the
moment
they
touched
turf
with
one
look
back
at
him
she
was
off
had
she
all
the
time
meant
to
give
him
this
breakneck
had
the
loveliness
of
that
autumn
day
gone
to
her
sky
and
coppery
flames
of
bracken
in
the
sun
and
the
beech
leaves
and
the
oak
leaves
pure
highland
colouring
come
south
for
once
when
in
the
first
burst
he
had
tested
the
mare
wind
this
chase
of
her
indeed
was
sheer
delight
through
glades
over
fallen
in
bracken
up
to
the
hocks
out
across
the
open
past
a
herd
of
amazed
and
solemn
deer
over
rotten
ground
all
till
just
as
he
thought
he
was
up
to
her
she
slipped
away
by
a
quick
turn
round
trees
mischief
incarnate
but
something
deeper
than
mischief
too
he
came
up
with
her
at
last
and
leaned
over
to
seize
her
rein
with
a
cut
of
her
whip
that
missed
his
hand
by
a
bare
inch
and
a
wrench
she
made
him
shoot
past
wheeled
in
her
tracks
and
was
off
again
like
an
arrow
back
amongst
the
right
forward
under
the
boughs
along
the
neck
of
her
little
horse
then
out
from
amongst
the
trees
she
shot
downhill
right
down
she
went
full
tilt
and
after
her
went
lennan
lying
back
and
expecting
the
bay
mare
to
come
down
at
every
stride
this
was
her
idea
of
fun
she
switched
round
at
the
bottom
and
went
galloping
along
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
he
thought
now
i
got
her
she
could
not
break
back
up
that
hill
and
there
was
no
other
cover
for
fully
half
a
mile
then
he
saw
not
thirty
yards
in
front
an
old
sandpit
and
great
god
she
was
going
straight
at
it
and
shouting
frantically
he
reined
his
mare
outwards
but
she
only
raised
her
whip
cut
the
magpie
horse
over
the
flank
and
rode
right
on
he
saw
that
little
demon
gather
its
feet
and
down
saw
him
pitch
struggle
she
flung
forward
roll
over
and
lie
on
her
back
he
felt
nothing
at
the
moment
only
had
that
fixed
vision
of
a
yellow
patch
of
sand
the
blue
sky
a
rook
flying
and
her
face
upturned
but
when
he
came
on
her
she
was
on
her
feet
holding
the
bridle
of
her
dazed
horse
no
sooner
did
he
touch
her
than
she
sank
down
her
eyes
were
closed
but
he
could
feel
that
she
had
not
fainted
and
he
just
held
her
and
kept
pressing
his
lips
to
her
eyes
and
forehead
suddenly
she
let
her
head
fall
back
and
her
lips
met
his
then
opening
her
eyes
she
said
i
not
hurt
has
magpie
cut
his
knees
not
quite
knowing
what
he
did
he
got
up
to
look
the
little
horse
was
cropping
at
some
grass
sand
and
fern
had
saved
his
knees
and
the
languid
voice
behind
him
said
it
all
can
leave
the
horses
they
come
when
i
now
that
he
knew
she
was
unhurt
he
felt
angry
why
had
she
behaved
in
this
mad
him
this
fearful
shock
but
in
that
same
languid
voice
she
went
on
do
be
cross
with
me
i
thought
at
first
pull
up
but
then
i
thought
i
jump
he
ca
help
being
i
leave
off
loving
me
because
i
not
hurt
terribly
moved
he
sat
down
beside
her
took
her
hands
in
his
and
said
nell
nell
it
all
madness
why
do
think
about
it
i
do
want
you
to
to
love
my
child
you
do
know
what
love
is
for
answer
she
only
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
then
since
he
held
back
from
kissing
her
let
them
fall
again
and
jumped
up
very
well
but
i
love
you
you
can
think
of
ca
prevent
me
and
without
waiting
for
help
she
mounted
the
magpie
horse
from
the
where
they
had
fallen
very
sober
that
ride
home
the
horses
as
if
ashamed
of
their
mad
chase
were
edging
close
to
each
other
so
that
now
and
then
his
arm
would
touch
her
shoulder
he
asked
her
once
what
she
had
felt
while
she
was
jumping
only
to
be
sure
my
foot
was
free
it
was
rather
horrid
coming
down
thinking
of
magpie
knees
and
touching
the
little
horse
ears
she
added
softly
poor
dear
he
be
stiff
she
was
again
only
the
confiding
rather
drowsy
child
or
was
it
that
the
fierceness
of
those
past
moments
had
killed
his
power
of
feeling
an
almost
dreamy
the
sun
going
down
the
lamps
being
lighted
one
by
a
sort
of
sweet
oblivion
over
everything
at
the
door
where
the
groom
was
waiting
lennan
would
have
said
but
she
whispered
oh
no
please
i
am
tired
might
help
me
up
a
and
so
half
carrying
her
he
mounted
past
the
vanity
fair
cartoons
and
through
the
corridor
with
the
red
paper
and
the
van
beers
drawings
into
the
room
where
he
had
first
seen
her
once
settled
back
in
dromore
great
chair
with
the
purring
kitten
curled
up
on
her
neck
she
murmured
is
it
nice
you
can
make
tea
and
we
have
hot
buttered
and
so
lennan
stayed
while
the
confidential
man
brought
tea
and
toast
and
never
once
looking
at
them
seemed
to
know
all
that
had
passed
all
that
might
be
to
come
then
they
were
alone
again
and
gazing
down
at
her
stretched
out
in
that
great
chair
lennan
thought
thank
god
that
i
tired
and
soul
but
suddenly
she
looked
up
at
him
and
pointing
to
the
picture
that
had
no
curtain
drawn
said
do
you
think
i
like
her
i
made
oliver
tell
me
this
summer
that
why
you
need
bother
it
does
matter
what
happens
to
me
you
see
and
i
do
you
can
love
me
without
feeling
bad
about
it
and
you
will
wo
you
then
with
her
eyes
still
on
his
face
she
went
on
quickly
only
we
wo
talk
about
that
now
will
we
it
too
cosy
i
am
nice
and
tired
do
smoke
but
lennan
fingers
trembled
so
that
he
could
hardly
light
that
cigarette
and
watching
them
she
said
please
give
me
one
dad
does
like
my
the
virtue
of
johnny
dromore
yes
it
would
always
be
by
proxy
and
he
muttered
how
do
you
think
he
would
like
to
know
about
this
afternoon
nell
i
do
then
peering
up
through
the
kitten
fur
she
murmured
oliver
wants
me
to
go
to
a
dance
on
for
a
charity
shall
i
of
course
why
not
will
you
come

oh

my
very
first
you
know
i
got
an
extra
and
against
his
will
his
lennan
answered
she
clapped
her
hands
and
the
kitten
crawled
down
to
her
knees
when
he
got
up
to
go
she
did
not
move
but
just
looked
up
at
him
and
how
he
got
away
he
did
not
know
stopping
his
cab
a
little
short
of
home
he
ran
for
he
felt
cold
and
stiff
and
letting
himself
in
with
his
went
straight
to
the
the
door
was
ajar
and
sylvia
standing
at
the
window
he
heard
her
sigh
and
his
heart
smote
him
very
still
and
slender
and
lonely
she
looked
out
there
with
the
light
shining
on
her
fair
hair
so
that
it
seemed
almost
white
then
she
turned
and
saw
him
he
noticed
her
throat
working
with
the
effort
she
made
not
to
show
him
anything
and
he
said
surely
you
have
been
anxious
nell
had
a
bit
of
a
into
a
sandpit
she
quite
mad
sometimes
i
stayed
to
tea
with
to
make
sure
she
was
really
but
as
he
spoke
he
loathed
himself
his
voice
sounded
so
false
she
only
answered
it
all
right
dear
but
he
saw
that
she
kept
her
blue
too
true
even
when
she
kissed
him
and
so
began
another
evening
and
night
and
morning
of
fever
subterfuge
wariness
aching
a
round
of
torment
out
of
which
he
seemed
no
more
able
to
break
than
a
man
can
break
through
the
walls
of
a
cell
though
it
live
but
a
day
in
the
sun
though
it
drown
in
tenebrous
night
the
dark
flower
of
passion
will
have
its
hour
xii
to
deceive
undoubtedly
requires
a
course
of
training
and
unversed
in
this
art
lennan
was
fast
finding
it
intolerable
to
scheme
and
watch
himself
and
mislead
one
who
had
looked
up
to
him
ever
since
they
were
children
yet
all
the
time
he
had
a
feeling
that
since
he
alone
knew
all
the
circumstances
of
his
case
he
alone
was
entitled
to
blame
or
to
excuse
himself
the
glib
judgments
that
moralists
would
pass
upon
his
conduct
could
be
nothing
but
the
imbecilities
of
smug
and
pharisaic
those
not
under
this
drugging
such
as
had
not
blood
enough
perhaps
ever
to
fall
beneath
it
the
day
after
the
ride
nell
had
not
come
and
he
had
no
word
from
her
was
she
then
hurt
after
all
she
had
lain
back
very
inertly
in
that
chair
and
sylvia
never
asked
if
he
knew
how
the
girl
was
after
her
fall
nor
offered
to
send
round
to
inquire
did
she
not
wish
to
speak
of
her
or
had
she
believed
when
there
was
so
much
he
could
not
talk
of
it
seemed
hard
that
just
what
happened
to
be
true
should
be
distrusted
she
had
not
yet
indeed
by
a
single
word
suggested
that
she
felt
he
was
deceiving
her
but
at
heart
he
knew
that
she
was
not
deceived
those
feelers
of
a
woman
who
anything
check
their
delicate
apprehension
towards
evening
the
longing
to
see
the
sensation
as
if
she
were
calling
him
to
come
to
almost
insupportable
yet
whatever
excuse
he
gave
he
felt
that
sylvia
would
know
where
he
was
going
he
sat
on
one
side
of
the
fire
she
on
the
other
and
they
both
read
books
the
only
strange
thing
about
their
reading
was
that
neither
of
them
ever
turned
a
leaf
it
was
quixote
he
read
the
page
which
had
these
words
let
altisidora
weep
or
sing
still
i
am
dulcinea
and
hers
alone
dead
or
alive
dutiful
and
unchanged
in
spite
of
all
the
necromantic
powers
in
the
and
so
the
evening
passed
when
she
went
up
to
bed
he
was
very
near
to
stealing
out
driving
up
to
the
dromores
door
and
inquiring
of
the
confidential
man
but
the
thought
of
the
confounded
fellow
eyes
was
too
much
for
him
and
he
held
out
he
took
up
sylvia
book
de
maupassant
comme
la
at
the
page
where
the
poor
woman
finds
that
her
lover
has
passed
away
from
her
to
her
own
daughter
and
as
he
read
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheek
sylvia
sylvia
were
not
his
old
favourite
words
from
that
old
favourite
book
still
true
dulcinea
del
toboso
is
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
and
i
the
most
unfortunate
knight
upon
the
earth
it
were
unjust
that
such
perfection
should
suffer
through
my
weakness
no
pierce
my
body
with
your
lance
knight
and
let
my
life
expire
with
my
honour
why
could
he
not
wrench
this
feeling
from
his
heart
banish
this
girl
from
his
eyes
why
could
he
not
be
wholly
true
to
her
who
was
and
always
had
been
wholly
true
to
him
nerveless
feeling
this
paralysis
as
if
he
were
a
puppet
moved
by
a
cruel
hand
and
as
once
before
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
girl
was
sitting
there
in
sylvia
chair
in
her
dark
red
frock
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
uncannily
impression
a
man
could
not
go
on
long
with
his
head
in
chancery
like
this
without
becoming
crazed
it
was
growing
dusk
on
saturday
afternoon
when
he
gave
up
that
intolerable
waiting
and
opened
the
studio
door
to
go
to
nell
it
was
now
just
two
days
since
he
had
seen
or
heard
of
her
she
had
spoken
of
a
dance
for
that
very
his
going
to
it
she
must
be
ill
but
he
had
not
taken
six
steps
when
he
saw
her
coming
she
had
on
a
grey
furry
scarf
hiding
her
mouth
making
her
look
much
older
the
moment
the
door
was
shut
she
threw
it
off
went
to
the
hearth
drew
up
a
little
stool
and
holding
her
hands
out
to
the
fire
said
have
you
thought
about
me
have
you
thought
enough
now
and
he
answered
yes
i
thought
but
i
no
why
nobody
need
ever
know
you
love
me
and
if
they
did
i
simple
how
simple
glorious
egoistic
youth
he
could
not
speak
of
sylvia
to
this
of
his
married
life
hitherto
so
dignified
so
almost
sacred
it
was
impossible
then
he
heard
her
say
it
ca
be
wrong
to
love
you
i
do
care
if
it
is
wrong
and
saw
her
lips
quivering
and
her
eyes
suddenly
piteous
and
scared
as
if
for
the
first
time
she
doubted
of
the
issue
here
was
fresh
torment
to
watch
an
unhappy
child
and
what
was
the
use
of
even
trying
to
make
clear
to
the
very
threshold
of
hopeless
maze
that
he
was
wandering
in
what
chance
of
making
her
understand
the
marsh
of
mud
and
tangled
weeds
he
must
drag
through
to
reach
her
nobody
need
so
simple
what
of
his
heart
and
his
wife
heart
and
pointing
to
his
new
first
man
bewitched
by
the
first
said
look
at
this
nell
that
nymph
is
you
and
this
man
is
she
got
up
and
came
to
look
and
while
she
was
gazing
he
greedily
drank
her
in
what
a
strange
mixture
of
innocence
and
sorcery
what
a
wonderful
young
creature
to
bring
to
full
knowledge
of
love
within
his
arms
and
he
said
you
had
better
understand
what
you
are
to
that
i
shall
never
know
again
there
it
is
in
that
nymph
face
oh
no
not
your
face
and
there
am
i
struggling
through
slime
to
reach
my
face
of
she
said
poor
face
then
covered
her
own
was
she
going
to
cry
and
torture
him
still
more
but
instead
she
only
murmured
but
you
have
reached
me
swayed
towards
him
and
put
her
lips
to
his
he
gave
way
then
from
that
too
stormy
kiss
of
his
she
drew
back
for
a
second
then
as
if
afraid
of
her
own
recoil
snuggled
close
again
but
the
instinctive
shrinking
of
innocence
had
been
enough
for
dropped
his
arms
and
said
you
must
go
without
a
word
she
picked
up
her
fur
put
it
on
and
stood
waiting
for
him
to
speak
then
as
he
did
not
she
held
out
something
white
it
was
the
card
for
the
dance
you
said
you
were
coming
and
he
nodded
her
eyes
and
lips
smiled
at
him
she
opened
the
door
and
still
with
that
slow
happy
smile
went
out
yes
he
would
be
coming
wherever
she
was
whenever
she
wanted
him
his
blood
on
fire
heedless
of
everything
but
to
rush
after
happiness
lennan
spent
those
hours
before
the
dance
he
had
told
sylvia
that
he
would
be
dining
at
his
set
of
rooms
owned
by
a
small
coterie
of
artists
in
chelsea
he
had
taken
this
precaution
feeling
that
he
could
not
sit
through
dinner
opposite
her
and
then
go
out
to
that
nell
he
had
spoken
of
a
guest
at
the
club
to
account
for
evening
lie
but
what
did
it
matter
he
was
lying
all
the
time
if
not
in
words
in
lie
indeed
to
save
her
suffering
he
stopped
at
the
frenchwoman
flower
shop
que
monsieur
des
oeillets
ai
de
bien
beaux
ce
des
oeillets
rouges
yes
those
to
this
address
no
green
with
them
no
card
how
strange
the
the
die
once
cast
for
rushing
of
watching
his
own
self
being
left
behind
in
the
brompton
road
outside
a
little
restaurant
a
thin
musician
was
playing
on
a
violin
ah
and
he
knew
this
place
he
would
go
in
there
not
to
the
the
fiddler
should
have
all
he
had
to
spare
for
playing
those
tunes
of
love
he
turned
in
he
had
not
been
there
since
the
day
before
that
night
on
the
river
twenty
years
ago
never
since
and
yet
it
was
not
changed
the
same
tarnished
gilt
and
smell
of
cooking
the
same
macaroni
in
the
same
tomato
sauce
the
same
chianti
flasks
the
same
staring
walls
wreathed
with
pink
flowers
only
the
waiter
patient
dark
of
eye
he
too
should
be
well
tipped
and
that
poor
lady
eating
her
frugal
her
at
all
events
a
look
of
kindness
for
all
desperate
creatures
he
must
feel
this
desperate
night
and
suddenly
he
thought
of
oliver
another
desperate
one
what
should
he
say
to
oliver
at
this
aged
coming
there
without
his
wife
some
imbecility
such
as
the
human
form
divine
in
motion
sidelights
on
nell
for
the
cant
it
did
not
matter
the
wine
was
drawn
and
he
must
drink
it
was
still
early
when
he
left
the
dry
night
very
calm
not
cold
when
had
he
danced
last
with
olive
cramier
before
he
knew
he
loved
her
well
that
memory
could
not
be
broken
for
he
would
not
dance
just
watch
sit
with
the
girl
a
few
minutes
feel
her
hand
cling
to
his
see
her
eyes
turned
back
to
him
away
and
future
for
the
wine
was
drawn
the
leaf
of
a
fluttering
down
caught
on
his
sleeve
autumn
would
soon
be
gone
and
after
winter
she
would
have
done
with
him
long
before
he
came
to
winter
nature
would
see
to
it
that
youth
called
for
her
and
carried
her
away
nature
in
her
courses
but
just
to
cheat
nature
for
a
little
while
to
cheat
greater
happiness
here
was
the
place
with
awning
carriages
driving
away
loiterers
watching
he
turned
in
with
a
beating
heart
was
he
before
her
how
would
she
come
to
this
first
dance
with
oliver
alone
or
had
some
chaperon
been
found
to
have
come
because
child
so
lovely
born
have
need
of
chaperonage
would
have
been
some
comfort
to
dignity
so
wistful
so
lost
as
his
but
alas
he
knew
he
was
only
there
because
he
could
not
keep
away
already
they
were
dancing
in
the
hall
upstairs
but
not
she
yet
and
he
stood
leaning
against
the
wall
where
she
must
pass
lonely
and
out
of
place
he
felt
as
if
everyone
must
know
why
he
was
there
people
stared
and
he
heard
a
girl
ask
who
that
against
the
wall
with
the
hair
and
dark
moustache
her
partner
murmuring
his
answer
and
her
voice
again
yes
he
looks
as
if
he
were
seeing
sand
and
for
whom
then
did
they
take
him
thank
heaven
they
were
all
the
usual
sort
there
would
be
no
one
that
he
knew
suppose
johnny
dromore
himself
came
with
nell
he
was
to
be
back
on
saturday
what
could
he
say
then
how
meet
those
doubting
knowing
eyes
goggling
with
the
fixed
philosophy
that
a
man
has
but
one
use
for
woman
god
and
it
would
be
true
for
a
moment
he
was
on
the
point
of
getting
his
coat
and
hat
and
sneaking
away
that
would
mean
not
seeing
her
till
monday
and
he
stood
his
ground
but
after
there
must
be
no
more
such
meetings
must
be
wisely
planned
must
sink
underground
and
then
he
saw
her
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
in
a
dress
of
a
colour
with
one
of
his
flowers
in
her
hair
and
the
others
tied
to
the
handle
of
a
tiny
fan
how
she
looked
as
if
this
were
indeed
her
native
neck
and
arms
bare
her
cheeks
a
deep
soft
pink
her
eyes
quickly
turning
here
and
there
she
began
mounting
the
stairs
and
saw
him
was
ever
anything
so
lovely
as
she
looked
just
then
behind
her
he
marked
oliver
and
a
tall
girl
with
red
hair
and
another
young
man
he
moved
deliberately
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
on
the
wall
side
so
that
from
behind
they
should
not
see
her
face
when
she
greeted
him
she
put
the
little
fan
with
the
flowers
to
her
lips
and
holding
out
her
hand
said
quick
and
low
the
fourth
it
a
polka
we
sit
out
wo
we
then
swaying
a
little
so
that
her
hair
and
the
flower
in
it
almost
touched
his
face
she
passed
and
there
in
her
stead
stood
oliver
lennan
had
expected
one
of
his
old
insolent
looks
but
the
young
face
was
eager
and
quite
friendly
it
was
awfully
good
of
you
to
come
lennan
is
and
lennan
murmured
she
was
able
she
not
and
could
have
sunk
into
the
shining
floor
youth
with
its
touching
confidence
its
eager
trust
this
was
the
way
he
was
fulfilling
his
duty
towards
youth
when
they
had
passed
into
the
ballroom
he
went
back
to
his
position
against
the
wall
they
were
dancing
number
three
his
time
of
waiting
then
was
drawing
to
a
close
from
where
he
stood
he
could
not
see
the
use
to
watch
her
go
round
in
someone
else
arms
not
a
true
french
or
spanish
pavement
song
played
in
waltz
time
bizarre
pathetic
whirling
after
its
own
happiness
that
chase
for
happiness
well
life
with
all
its
prizes
and
its
possibilities
had
nothing
that
quite
just
the
fleeting
moments
of
passion
nothing
else
quite
poignant
enough
to
be
called
pure
joy
or
so
it
seemed
to
him
the
waltz
was
over
he
could
see
her
now
on
a
rout
seat
against
the
wall
with
the
other
young
man
turning
her
eyes
constantly
as
if
to
make
sure
that
he
was
still
standing
there
what
subtle
fuel
was
always
being
added
to
the
fire
by
that
flattery
of
her
inexplicable
those
eyes
that
dragged
him
to
her
yet
humbly
followed
him
too
five
times
while
she
sat
there
he
saw
the
girl
or
oliver
bring
men
up
saw
youths
cast
longing
glances
saw
girls
watching
her
with
cold
appraisement
or
with
a
touching
frank
delight
from
the
moment
that
she
came
in
there
had
been
in
her
father
phrase
one
in
it
and
she
could
pass
all
this
by
and
still
want
him
incredible
at
the
first
notes
of
the
polka
he
went
to
her
it
was
she
who
found
their
place
of
little
alcove
behind
two
but
sitting
there
he
realized
as
never
before
that
there
was
no
spiritual
communion
between
him
and
this
child
she
could
tell
him
her
troubles
or
her
joys
he
could
soothe
or
sympathize
but
never
would
the
gap
between
their
natures
and
their
ages
be
crossed
his
happiness
was
only
in
the
sight
and
touch
of
her
but
that
god
knew
was
happiness
feverish
craving
joy
like
an
overtired
man
thirst
growing
with
the
drink
on
which
it
tries
to
slake
itself
sitting
there
in
the
scent
of
those
flowers
and
of
some
sweet
essence
in
her
hair
with
her
fingers
touching
his
and
her
eyes
seeking
his
he
tried
loyally
not
to
think
of
himself
to
grasp
her
sensations
at
this
her
first
dance
and
just
help
her
to
enjoyment
but
he
could
made
drunk
by
that
insensate
longing
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
crush
her
to
him
as
he
had
those
few
hours
back
he
could
see
her
expanding
like
a
flower
in
all
this
light
and
motion
and
intoxicating
admiration
round
her
what
business
had
he
in
her
life
with
his
dark
hunger
after
secret
hours
coin
worn
thin
destroyer
of
the
freshness
and
the
glamour
of
her
youth
and
beauty
then
holding
up
the
flowers
she
said
did
you
give
me
these
because
of
the
one
i
gave
you
what
did
you
do
with
that
burned
oh
but
why
because
you
are
a
witches
must
be
burned
with
all
their
are
you
going
to
burn
me
he
put
his
hand
on
her
cool
arm
feel
the
flames
are
you
may
i
do
care
she
took
his
hand
and
laid
her
cheek
against
it
yet
to
the
music
which
had
begun
again
the
tip
of
her
shoe
was
already
beating
time
and
he
said
you
ought
to
be
dancing
oh
no
only
it
a
pity
you
do
want
yes
do
you
understand
that
it
must
all
be
she
covered
his
lips
with
the
fan
and
said
you
not
to
think
you
not
to
when
can
i
come
i
must
find
the
best
way
not
nobody
must
know
your
she
nodded
and
repeated
with
a
soft
mysterious
wisdom
and
then
aloud
here
oliver
it
was
awfully
good
of
you
to
come
and
as
on
oliver
arm
she
left
their
little
refuge
she
looked
back
he
watch
her
through
this
one
dance
how
they
made
all
the
other
couples
sink
into
insignificance
with
that
something
in
them
both
that
was
better
than
mere
good
something
not
outre
or
eccentric
but
poignant
wayward
they
went
well
together
those
two
dark
head
and
her
fair
head
his
clear
brown
daring
eyes
and
her
grey
languorous
mesmeric
eyes
ah
master
oliver
was
happy
now
with
her
so
close
to
him
it
was
not
jealousy
that
lennan
felt
not
did
not
feel
jealous
of
the
young
something
very
sense
of
proportion
who
knew
that
she
too
looked
happy
as
if
her
soul
were
dancing
vibrating
with
the
music
and
the
scent
of
the
flowers
he
waited
for
her
to
come
round
once
more
to
get
for
a
last
time
that
flying
glance
turned
back
then
found
his
coat
and
hat
and
went
xiii
outside
he
walked
a
few
steps
then
stood
looking
back
at
the
windows
of
the
hall
through
some
trees
the
shadows
of
whose
trunks
in
the
light
of
a
street
lamp
were
spilled
out
along
the
ground
like
the
splines
of
a
fan
a
church
clock
struck
eleven
for
hours
yet
she
would
be
there
going
round
and
round
in
the
arms
of
youth
try
as
he
might
he
could
never
recapture
for
himself
the
look
that
oliver
face
had
look
that
was
the
symbol
of
so
much
more
than
he
himself
could
give
her
why
had
she
come
into
his
her
undoing
and
his
own
and
the
bizarre
thought
came
to
him
if
she
were
dead
should
i
really
care
should
i
not
be
almost
glad
if
she
were
dead
her
witchery
would
be
dead
and
i
could
stand
up
straight
again
and
look
people
in
the
face
what
was
this
power
that
played
with
men
darted
into
them
twisted
their
hearts
to
rags
this
power
that
had
looked
through
her
eyes
when
she
put
her
fan
with
his
flowers
to
her
lips
the
thrumming
of
the
music
ceased
he
walked
away
it
must
have
been
nearly
twelve
when
he
reached
home
now
once
more
would
begin
the
gruesome
process
of
of
soul
and
brazening
of
visage
it
would
be
better
when
the
whole
thievish
business
was
irretrievably
begun
and
ordered
in
its
secret
courses
there
was
no
light
in
the
save
just
the
glow
of
the
fire
if
only
sylvia
might
have
gone
to
bed
then
he
saw
her
sitting
motionless
out
there
by
the
uncurtained
window
he
went
over
to
her
and
began
his
hateful
formula
i
afraid
you
been
lonely
i
had
to
stay
rather
late
a
dull
and
since
she
did
not
move
or
answer
but
just
sat
there
very
still
and
white
he
forced
himself
to
go
close
bend
down
to
her
touch
her
cheek
even
to
kneel
beside
her
she
looked
round
then
her
face
was
quiet
enough
but
her
eyes
were
strangely
eager
with
a
pitiful
little
smile
she
broke
out
oh
mark
what
is
is
it
anything
is
better
than
this
perhaps
it
was
the
smile
perhaps
her
voice
or
something
gave
way
in
lennan
secrecy
precaution
went
by
the
board
bowing
his
head
against
her
breast
he
poured
it
all
out
while
they
clung
clutched
together
in
the
half
dark
like
two
frightened
children
only
when
he
had
finished
did
he
realize
that
if
she
had
pushed
him
away
refused
to
let
him
touch
her
it
would
have
been
far
less
piteous
far
easier
to
bear
than
her
wan
face
and
her
hands
clutching
him
and
her
words
i
never
and
and
the
trust
in
their
life
together
in
himself
that
those
words
revealed
yet
not
greater
than
he
had
had
she
could
not
had
known
that
she
could
never
understand
it
was
why
he
had
fought
so
for
secrecy
all
through
she
was
taking
it
as
if
she
had
lost
everything
and
in
his
mind
she
had
lost
nothing
this
passion
this
craving
for
youth
and
life
this
it
what
one
something
quite
apart
not
touching
his
love
and
need
of
her
if
she
would
only
believe
that
over
and
over
he
repeated
it
over
and
over
again
perceived
that
she
could
not
take
it
in
the
only
thing
she
saw
was
that
his
love
had
gone
from
her
to
that
was
not
true
suddenly
she
broke
out
of
his
arms
pushing
him
from
her
and
cried
that
horrible
false
never
had
he
seen
her
look
like
this
with
flaming
spots
in
her
white
cheeks
soft
lips
and
chin
distorted
blue
eyes
flaming
breast
heaving
as
if
each
breath
were
drawn
from
lungs
that
received
no
air
and
then
as
quickly
the
fire
went
out
of
her
she
sank
down
on
the
sofa
covering
her
face
with
her
arms
rocking
to
and
fro
she
did
not
cry
but
a
little
moan
came
from
her
now
and
then
and
each
one
of
those
sounds
was
to
lennan
like
the
cry
of
something
he
was
murdering
at
last
he
went
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
by
her
and
said
sylvia
sylvia
do
oh
do
and
she
was
silent
ceasing
to
rock
herself
letting
him
smooth
and
stroke
her
but
her
face
she
kept
hidden
and
only
once
she
spoke
so
low
that
he
could
hardly
hear
i
wo
keep
you
from
and
with
the
awful
feeling
that
no
words
could
reach
or
soothe
the
wound
in
that
tender
heart
he
could
only
go
on
stroking
and
kissing
her
hands
it
was
that
he
had
done
god
knew
that
he
had
not
sought
thing
had
come
on
him
surely
even
in
her
misery
she
could
see
that
deep
down
beneath
his
grief
and
he
knew
what
neither
she
nor
anyone
else
could
he
could
not
have
prevented
this
feeling
which
went
back
to
days
before
he
ever
saw
the
no
man
could
have
stopped
that
feeling
in
himself
this
craving
and
roving
was
as
much
part
of
him
as
his
eyes
and
hands
as
overwhelming
and
natural
a
longing
as
his
hunger
for
work
or
his
need
of
the
peace
that
sylvia
gave
and
alone
could
give
him
that
was
the
was
all
sunk
and
rooted
in
the
very
nature
of
a
man
since
the
girl
had
come
into
their
lives
he
was
no
more
unfaithful
to
his
wife
in
thought
than
he
had
been
before
if
only
she
could
look
into
him
see
him
exactly
as
he
was
as
without
part
or
lot
in
the
process
he
had
been
she
would
understand
and
even
might
not
suffer
but
she
could
not
and
he
could
never
make
it
plain
and
solemnly
desperately
with
a
weary
feeling
of
the
futility
of
words
he
went
on
trying
could
she
not
see
it
was
all
a
thing
outside
craving
a
chase
after
beauty
and
life
after
his
own
youth
at
that
word
she
looked
at
him
and
do
you
think
i
do
want
my
youth
back
he
stopped
for
a
woman
to
feel
that
her
brightness
of
her
hair
and
eyes
the
grace
and
suppleness
of
her
slipping
from
her
and
from
the
man
she
loved
was
there
anything
more
bitter
any
more
sacred
duty
than
not
to
add
to
that
bitterness
not
to
push
her
with
suffering
into
old
age
but
to
help
keep
the
star
of
her
faith
in
her
charm
intact
man
and
both
wanted
youth
again
she
that
she
might
give
it
all
to
him
he
because
it
would
help
him
towards
just
that
world
of
difference
he
got
up
and
said
come
dear
let
try
and
he
had
not
once
said
that
he
could
give
it
up
the
words
would
not
pass
his
lips
though
he
knew
she
must
be
conscious
that
he
had
not
said
them
must
be
longing
to
hear
them
all
he
had
been
able
to
say
was
so
long
as
you
want
me
you
shall
never
lose
me
and
i
will
never
keep
anything
from
you
up
in
their
room
she
lay
hour
after
hour
in
his
arms
quite
unresentful
but
without
life
in
her
and
with
eyes
that
when
his
lips
touched
them
were
always
wet
what
a
maze
was
a
man
heart
wherein
he
must
lose
himself
every
minute
what
involved
and
intricate
turnings
and
turnings
on
itself
what
fugitive
replacement
of
emotion
by
emotion
what
strife
between
pities
and
passions
what
longing
for
peace
and
in
his
feverish
exhaustion
which
was
almost
sleep
lennan
hardly
knew
whether
it
was
the
thrum
of
music
or
sylvia
moaning
that
he
heard
her
body
or
nell
within
his
arms
but
life
had
to
be
lived
a
face
preserved
against
the
world
engagements
kept
and
the
nightmare
went
on
for
both
of
them
under
the
calm
surface
of
an
ordinary
sunday
they
were
like
people
walking
at
the
edge
of
a
high
cliff
not
knowing
from
step
to
step
whether
they
would
fall
or
like
swimmers
struggling
for
issue
out
of
a
dark
whirlpool
in
the
afternoon
they
went
together
to
a
concert
it
was
just
something
to
that
saved
them
for
an
hour
or
two
from
the
possibility
of
speaking
on
the
one
subject
left
to
them
the
ship
had
gone
down
and
they
were
clutching
at
anything
that
for
a
moment
would
help
to
keep
them
above
water
in
the
evening
some
people
came
to
supper
a
writer
and
two
painters
with
their
wives
a
grim
more
so
than
when
the
conversation
turned
on
that
perennial
freedom
spiritual
mental
physical
requisite
for
those
who
practise
art
all
the
stale
arguments
were
brought
forth
and
had
to
be
joined
in
with
unmoved
faces
and
for
all
their
talk
of
freedom
lennan
could
see
the
his
friends
would
be
making
if
they
only
knew
it
was
not
thing
to
seduce
young
if
forsooth
there
were
freedom
in
doing
only
what
people
thought
thing
their
cant
about
the
free
artist
spirit
experiencing
everything
would
wither
the
moment
it
came
up
against
a
canon
of
form
so
that
in
truth
it
was
no
freer
than
the
bourgeois
spirit
with
its
conventions
or
the
priest
spirit
with
its
cry
of
no
no
to
resistance
were
possible
to
this
dragging
of
form
dogmas
of
religion
and
morality
were
no
was
any
help
but
some
feeling
stronger
than
passion
itself
sylvia
face
forced
to
smile
indeed
was
a
reason
why
they
should
condemn
him
none
of
their
doctrines
about
freedom
could
explain
that
harm
the
death
that
came
to
a
soul
when
he
made
a
loving
faithful
creature
suffer
but
they
were
gone
at
their
thanks
so
much
and
their
delightful
evening
and
those
two
were
face
to
face
for
another
night
he
knew
that
it
must
begin
all
over
after
the
stab
of
that
wretched
argument
plunged
into
their
hearts
and
turned
and
turned
all
the
evening
i
wo
i
must
keep
you
starved
and
spoil
your
work
do
think
of
me
mark
i
can
bear
it
and
then
a
breakdown
worse
than
the
night
before
what
genius
what
sheer
genius
nature
had
for
torturing
her
creatures
if
anyone
had
told
him
even
so
little
as
a
week
ago
that
he
could
have
caused
such
suffering
to
whom
as
a
child
with
wide
blue
eyes
and
a
blue
bow
on
her
flaxen
head
he
had
guarded
across
fields
full
of
imaginary
bulls
sylvia
in
whose
hair
his
star
had
caught
sylvia
who
day
and
night
for
fifteen
years
had
been
his
devoted
wife
whom
he
loved
and
still
would
have
given
him
the
lie
direct
it
would
have
seemed
incredible
monstrous
silly
had
all
married
men
and
women
such
things
to
go
this
but
a
very
usual
crossing
of
the
desert
or
was
it
once
for
all
shipwreck
violent
a
storm
of
sand
another
night
of
misery
and
no
answer
to
that
question
yet
he
had
told
her
that
he
would
not
see
nell
again
without
first
letting
her
know
so
when
morning
came
he
simply
wrote
the
words
do
come
today
them
to
sylvia
and
sent
them
by
a
servant
to
dromore
hard
to
describe
the
bitterness
with
which
he
entered
his
studio
that
morning
in
all
this
chaos
what
of
his
work
could
he
ever
have
peace
of
mind
for
it
again
those
people
last
night
had
talked
of
of
passion
of
experience
in
pleading
with
her
he
had
used
the
words
himself
soul
but
repeated
them
trying
to
endure
them
to
believe
them
true
and
were
they
true
again
no
answer
or
certainly
none
that
he
could
give
to
have
had
the
waters
broken
up
to
be
plunged
into
emotion
to
feel
desperately
instead
of
day
he
might
be
knew
some
day
there
might
be
fair
country
again
beyond
this
desert
where
he
could
work
even
better
than
before
but
just
now
as
well
expect
creative
work
from
a
condemned
man
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
equally
destroyed
whether
he
gave
nell
up
and
with
her
once
for
all
that
roving
seeking
instinct
which
ought
forsooth
to
have
been
satisfied
and
was
not
or
whether
he
took
nell
knowing
that
in
doing
so
he
was
torturing
a
woman
dear
to
him
that
was
as
far
as
he
could
see
what
he
would
come
to
see
in
time
god
only
knew
but
of
the
spirit
that
was
a
phrase
of
bitter
irony
indeed
and
there
with
his
work
all
round
him
like
a
man
tied
hand
and
foot
he
was
swept
by
such
a
feeling
of
exasperated
rage
as
he
had
never
known
women
these
women
only
let
him
be
free
of
both
of
all
women
and
the
passions
and
pities
they
aroused
so
that
his
brain
and
his
hands
might
live
and
work
again
they
should
not
strangle
they
should
not
destroy
him
unfortunately
even
in
his
rage
he
knew
that
flight
from
them
both
could
never
help
him
one
way
or
the
other
the
thing
would
have
to
be
fought
through
if
it
had
been
a
straight
fight
even
a
clear
issue
between
passion
and
pity
but
both
he
loved
and
both
he
pitied
there
was
nothing
straight
and
clear
about
it
anywhere
it
was
all
too
deeply
rooted
in
full
human
nature
and
the
appalling
sense
of
rushing
ceaselessly
from
barrier
to
barrier
began
really
to
affect
his
brain
true
he
had
now
and
then
a
lucid
interval
of
a
few
minutes
when
the
ingenious
nature
of
his
own
torments
struck
him
as
supremely
interesting
and
queer
but
this
was
not
precisely
a
relief
for
it
only
meant
as
in
prolonged
toothache
that
his
power
of
feeling
had
for
a
moment
ceased
a
very
pretty
little
hell
indeed
all
day
he
had
the
premonition
amounting
to
certainty
that
nell
would
take
alarm
at
those
three
words
he
had
sent
her
and
come
in
spite
of
them
and
yet
what
else
could
he
have
written
nothing
save
what
must
have
alarmed
her
more
or
plunged
him
deeper
he
had
the
feeling
that
she
could
follow
his
moods
that
her
eyes
could
see
him
everywhere
as
a
cat
eyes
can
see
in
darkness
that
feeling
had
been
with
him
more
or
less
ever
since
the
last
evening
of
october
the
evening
she
came
back
from
her
how
long
ago
only
six
it
possible
ah
yes
she
knew
when
her
spell
was
weakening
when
the
current
wanted
as
it
were
renewing
and
about
six
the
least
surprise
with
only
a
sort
of
empty
quivering
he
heard
her
knock
and
just
behind
the
closed
door
as
near
as
he
could
get
to
her
he
stood
holding
his
breath
he
had
given
his
word
to
his
own
accord
had
given
it
through
the
thin
wood
of
the
old
door
he
could
hear
the
faint
shuffle
of
her
feet
on
the
pavement
moved
a
few
inches
this
way
and
that
as
though
supplicating
the
inexorable
silence
he
seemed
to
see
her
head
bent
a
little
forward
listening
three
times
she
knocked
and
each
time
lennan
writhed
it
was
so
cruel
with
that
of
hers
she
must
know
he
was
there
his
very
silence
would
be
telling
his
silence
had
its
voice
its
pitiful
breathless
sound
then
quite
distinctly
he
heard
her
sigh
and
her
footsteps
move
away
and
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
he
rushed
to
and
fro
in
the
studio
like
a
madman
no
sound
of
her
any
more
gone
it
was
unbearable
and
seizing
his
hat
he
ran
out
which
way
at
random
he
ran
towards
the
square
there
she
was
over
by
the
railings
languidly
irresolutely
moving
towards
home
xiv
but
now
that
she
was
within
reach
he
wavered
he
had
given
his
he
going
to
break
it
then
she
turned
and
saw
him
and
he
could
not
go
back
in
the
biting
easterly
wind
her
face
looked
small
and
pinched
and
cold
but
her
eyes
only
the
larger
the
more
full
of
witchery
as
if
beseeching
him
not
to
be
angry
not
to
send
her
away
i
had
to
come
i
got
frightened
why
did
you
write
such
a
tiny
little
note
he
tried
to
make
his
voice
sound
quiet
and
ordinary
you
must
be
brave
nell
i
have
had
to
tell
she
clutched
at
his
arm
then
drew
herself
up
and
said
in
her
clear
clipped
voice
oh
i
suppose
she
hates
me
then
she
is
terribly
they
walked
a
minute
that
might
have
been
an
hour
without
a
word
not
round
the
square
as
he
had
walked
with
oliver
but
away
from
the
house
at
last
she
said
in
a
voice
i
only
want
a
little
bit
of
and
he
answered
dully
in
love
there
are
no
little
standing
then
suddenly
he
felt
her
hand
in
his
the
fingers
lacing
twining
restlessly
amongst
his
own
and
again
the
voice
said
but
you
will
let
me
see
you
sometimes
you
must
hardest
of
all
to
stand
against
was
this
pathetic
clinging
frightened
child
and
not
knowing
very
clearly
what
he
said
he
murmured
it
be
all
right
be
must
be
brave
nell
all
come
but
she
only
answered
no
no
i
not
brave
i
shall
do
her
face
looked
just
as
when
she
had
ridden
at
that
gravel
pit
loving
wild
undisciplined
without
resource
of
any
might
she
not
do
why
could
he
not
stir
without
bringing
disaster
upon
one
or
other
and
between
these
two
suffering
so
because
of
him
he
felt
as
if
he
had
lost
his
own
existence
in
quest
of
happiness
he
had
come
to
that
suddenly
she
said
oliver
asked
me
again
at
the
dance
on
saturday
he
said
you
had
told
him
to
be
patient
did
you
why
i
was
sorry
for
she
let
his
hand
go
perhaps
you
would
like
me
to
marry
very
clearly
he
saw
those
two
going
round
and
round
over
the
shining
floor
it
would
be
better
she
made
a
little
anger
or
dismay
you
do
really
want
me
then
that
was
his
chance
but
with
her
arm
touching
his
her
face
so
pale
and
desperate
and
those
maddening
eyes
turned
to
him
he
could
not
tell
that
lie
and
answered
want
you
god
knows
at
that
a
sigh
of
content
escaped
her
as
if
she
were
saying
to
herself
he
wants
me
he
will
not
let
me
go
strange
little
tribute
to
her
faith
in
love
and
her
own
youth
they
had
come
somehow
to
pall
mall
by
now
and
scared
to
find
himself
so
deep
in
the
of
the
dromores
lennan
turned
hastily
towards
james
park
that
they
might
cross
it
in
the
dark
round
to
piccadilly
to
be
thus
slinking
out
of
the
world
sight
with
the
daughter
of
his
old
all
men
in
the
world
the
last
perhaps
that
he
should
do
this
to
a
nice
treacherous
business
but
the
thing
men
called
was
it
when
her
eyes
were
looking
at
him
and
her
shoulder
touching
his
since
he
had
spoken
those
words
yes
i
want
you
she
had
been
perhaps
to
let
other
words
destroy
their
comfort
but
near
the
gate
by
hyde
park
corner
she
put
her
hand
again
into
his
and
again
her
voice
so
clear
said
i
do
want
to
hurt
anybody
but
you
will
let
me
come
will
let
me
see
wo
leave
me
all
alone
thinking
that
never
see
you
again
and
once
more
without
knowing
what
he
answered
lennan
murmured
no
no
it
be
all
right
all
come
right
it
again
her
fingers
twined
amongst
his
like
a
child
she
seemed
to
have
a
wonderful
knowledge
of
the
exact
thing
to
say
and
do
to
keep
him
helpless
and
she
went
on
i
did
try
to
love
is
wrong
to
would
hurt
her
i
only
want
a
little
of
your
a
a
little
but
he
was
solely
bent
on
comforting
her
now
to
think
of
her
going
home
and
sitting
lonely
frightened
and
unhappy
all
the
evening
was
dreadful
and
holding
her
fingers
tight
he
kept
on
murmuring
words
of
comfort
then
he
saw
that
they
were
out
in
piccadilly
how
far
dared
he
go
with
her
along
the
railings
before
he
said
a
man
was
coming
towards
them
just
where
he
had
met
dromore
that
first
fatal
afternoon
nine
months
ago
a
man
with
a
slight
lurch
in
his
walk
and
a
tall
shining
hat
a
little
on
one
side
but
thank
heaven
was
not
one
somewhat
like
him
who
in
passing
stared
at
nell
and
lennan
said
you
must
go
home
now
child
we
must
be
seen
for
a
moment
he
thought
she
was
going
to
break
down
refuse
to
leave
him
then
she
threw
up
her
head
and
for
a
second
stood
like
that
quite
motionless
looking
in
his
face
suddenly
stripping
off
her
glove
she
thrust
her
warm
clinging
hand
into
his
her
lips
smiled
faintly
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
then
she
drew
her
hand
away
and
plunged
into
the
traffic
he
saw
her
turn
the
corner
of
her
street
and
disappear
and
with
the
warmth
of
that
passionate
little
hand
still
stinging
his
palm
he
almost
ran
towards
hyde
park
taking
no
heed
of
direction
he
launched
himself
into
its
dark
space
deserted
in
this
cold
homeless
wind
that
had
little
sound
and
no
scent
travelling
its
remorseless
road
under
the
sky
the
dark
firmament
and
keen
cold
air
suited
one
who
had
little
need
of
aids
to
who
had
indeed
but
the
single
wish
to
get
rid
if
he
only
could
of
the
terrible
sensation
in
his
head
that
bruised
battered
imprisoned
feeling
of
a
man
who
paces
his
never
to
get
out
at
either
end
without
thought
or
intention
he
drove
his
legs
along
not
running
because
he
knew
that
he
would
have
to
stop
the
sooner
alas
what
more
comic
spectacle
for
the
eyes
of
a
good
citizen
than
this
married
man
of
middle
age
striding
for
hours
over
those
dry
dark
empty
by
passion
and
by
pity
so
that
he
knew
not
even
whether
he
had
dined
but
no
good
citizen
was
abroad
of
an
autumn
night
in
a
bitter
easterly
wind
the
trees
were
the
sole
witnesses
of
this
grim
trees
resigning
to
the
cold
blast
their
crinkled
leaves
that
fluttered
past
him
just
a
little
lighter
than
the
darkness
here
and
there
his
feet
rustled
in
the
drifts
waiting
their
turn
to
serve
the
little
bonfires
whose
scent
still
clung
in
the
air
a
desperate
walk
in
this
heart
of
and
round
up
and
down
hour
after
hour
keeping
always
in
the
dark
not
a
star
in
the
sky
not
a
human
being
spoken
to
or
even
clearly
seen
not
a
bird
or
beast
just
the
gleam
of
the
lights
far
away
and
the
hoarse
muttering
of
the
traffic
a
walk
as
lonely
as
the
voyage
of
the
human
soul
is
lonely
from
birth
to
death
with
nothing
to
guide
it
but
the
flickering
glow
from
its
own
frail
spirit
lighted
it
knows
not
where
and
so
tired
that
he
could
hardly
move
his
legs
but
free
at
last
of
that
awful
feeling
in
his
for
the
first
time
for
days
and
came
out
of
the
park
at
the
gate
where
he
had
gone
in
and
walked
towards
his
home
certain
that
tonight
one
way
or
the
other
it
would
be
decided
xv
this
long
trouble
of
body
and
of
what
he
remembered
sitting
in
the
armchair
beyond
his
bedroom
fire
watching
the
glow
and
sylvia
sleeping
there
exhausted
while
the
dark
leaves
at
the
window
in
the
autumn
wind
watching
with
the
uncanny
certainty
that
he
would
not
pass
the
limits
of
this
night
without
having
made
at
last
a
decision
that
would
not
alter
for
even
conflict
wears
itself
out
even
indecision
has
this
measure
set
to
its
miserable
powers
of
torture
that
any
issue
in
the
end
is
better
than
the
hell
of
indecision
itself
once
or
twice
in
those
last
days
even
death
had
seemed
to
him
quite
tolerable
but
now
that
his
head
was
clear
and
he
had
come
to
grips
death
passed
out
of
his
mind
like
the
shadow
that
it
was
nothing
so
simple
extravagant
and
vain
could
serve
him
other
issues
had
reality
to
leave
sylvia
and
take
this
young
love
away
there
was
reality
in
that
but
it
had
always
faded
as
soon
as
it
shaped
itself
and
now
once
more
it
faded
to
put
such
a
public
and
terrible
affront
on
a
tender
wife
whom
he
loved
do
her
to
death
as
it
were
before
the
world
then
ever
remorseful
grow
old
while
the
girl
was
still
young
he
could
not
if
sylvia
had
not
loved
him
yes
or
even
if
he
had
not
loved
her
or
if
again
though
loving
him
she
had
stood
upon
her
any
of
those
events
he
might
have
done
it
but
to
leave
her
whom
he
did
love
and
who
had
said
to
him
so
generously
i
will
not
hamper
to
her
be
a
black
atrocity
every
memory
from
their
lovering
to
the
desperate
clinging
of
her
arms
these
last
two
with
its
innumerable
tentacles
the
invincible
strength
of
its
countless
threads
bound
him
to
her
too
fast
what
then
must
it
come
after
all
to
giving
up
the
girl
and
sitting
there
by
that
warm
fire
he
shivered
how
desolate
sacrilegious
wasteful
to
throw
love
away
to
turn
from
the
most
precious
of
all
gifts
to
drop
and
break
that
vase
there
was
not
too
much
love
in
the
world
nor
too
much
warmth
and
anyway
for
those
whose
sands
were
running
out
whose
blood
would
soon
be
cold
could
sylvia
not
let
him
keep
both
her
love
and
the
girl
could
she
not
bear
that
she
had
said
she
could
but
her
face
her
eyes
her
voice
gave
her
the
lie
so
that
every
time
he
heard
her
his
heart
turned
sick
with
pity
this
then
was
the
real
issue
could
he
accept
from
her
such
a
sacrifice
exact
a
daily
misery
see
her
droop
and
fade
beneath
it
could
he
bear
his
own
happiness
at
such
a
cost
would
it
be
happiness
at
all
he
got
up
from
the
chair
and
crept
towards
her
she
looked
very
fragile
sleeping
there
the
darkness
below
her
closed
eyelids
showed
cruelly
on
that
too
fair
skin
and
in
her
hair
he
saw
what
he
had
never
few
strands
of
white
her
softly
opened
lips
almost
colourless
quivered
with
her
uneven
breathing
and
now
and
again
a
little
feverish
shiver
passed
up
as
from
her
heart
all
soft
and
fragile
not
much
life
not
much
strength
youth
and
beauty
slipping
to
know
that
he
who
should
be
her
champion
against
age
and
time
would
day
by
day
be
placing
one
more
mark
upon
her
face
one
more
sorrow
in
her
heart
that
he
should
do
both
going
down
the
years
together
as
he
stood
there
holding
his
breath
bending
to
look
at
her
that
slurring
swish
of
the
branch
flung
against
and
against
the
window
by
the
autumn
wind
seemed
filling
the
whole
world
then
her
lips
moved
in
one
of
those
little
soft
hurrying
whispers
that
unhappy
dreamers
utter
the
words
all
blurred
with
their
wistful
rushing
and
he
thought
i
who
believe
in
bravery
and
kindness
i
who
hate
i
do
this
cruel
thing
what
shall
i
have
to
live
for
how
shall
i
work
how
bear
myself
if
i
do
it
i
am
outcast
from
my
own
renegade
from
all
that
i
believe
in
and
kneeling
there
close
to
that
face
so
sad
and
lonely
that
heart
so
beaten
even
in
its
sleep
he
knew
that
he
could
not
do
it
with
sudden
certainty
and
a
curious
sense
of
peace
over
long
at
last
youth
with
youth
summer
to
summer
falling
leaf
with
falling
leaf
and
behind
him
the
fire
flickered
and
the
leaves
he
rose
and
crept
away
stealthily
downstairs
into
the
and
through
the
window
at
the
far
end
out
into
the
courtyard
where
he
had
sat
that
day
by
the
hydrangea
listening
to
the
very
dark
and
cold
and
eerie
it
was
there
and
he
hurried
across
to
his
studio
there
too
it
was
cold
and
dark
and
eerie
with
its
ghostly
plaster
presences
stale
scent
of
cigarettes
and
just
one
glowing
ember
of
the
fire
he
had
left
when
he
rushed
out
after
seven
hours
ago
he
went
first
to
the
bureau
turned
up
its
lamp
and
taking
out
some
sheets
of
paper
marked
on
them
directions
for
his
various
works
for
the
statuette
of
nell
he
noted
that
it
should
be
taken
with
his
compliments
to
dromore
he
wrote
a
letter
to
his
banker
directing
money
to
be
sent
to
rome
and
to
his
solicitor
telling
him
to
let
the
house
he
wrote
quickly
if
sylvia
woke
and
found
him
still
away
what
might
she
not
think
he
took
a
last
sheet
did
it
matter
what
he
wrote
what
deliberate
lie
if
it
helped
nell
over
the
first
shock
dear
nell
i
write
this
hastily
in
the
early
hours
to
say
that
we
are
called
out
to
italy
to
my
only
sister
who
is
very
we
leave
by
the
first
morning
boat
and
may
be
away
some
time
i
will
write
again
do
fret
and
god
bless
you
m
he
could
not
see
very
well
as
he
wrote
poor
loving
desperate
child
well
she
had
youth
and
strength
and
would
soon
and
he
took
yet
another
sheet
dear
oliver
my
wife
and
i
are
obliged
to
go
to
italy
i
watched
you
both
at
the
dance
the
other
night
be
very
gentle
with
nell
luck
to
you
but
do
say
again
that
i
told
you
to
be
patient
it
is
hardly
the
way
to
make
her
love
you
m
that
then
was
all
he
turned
out
the
little
lamp
and
groped
towards
the
hearth
but
one
thing
left
to
say
to
her
and
youth
and
passion
the
only
salve
for
the
aching
that
spring
and
beauty
aching
for
the
wild
the
passionate
the
new
that
never
quite
dies
in
a
man
heart
ah
well
sooner
or
later
all
men
had
to
say
to
that
all
men
he
crouched
down
before
the
hearth
there
was
no
warmth
in
that
ember
but
it
still
glowed
like
a
flower
and
while
it
lived
he
crouched
there
as
though
it
were
that
to
which
he
was
saying
and
on
the
door
he
heard
the
girl
ghostly
knocking
and
beside
ghost
among
the
ghostly
stood
slowly
the
glow
blackened
till
the
last
spark
had
faded
out
then
by
the
glimmer
of
the
night
he
found
his
way
back
softly
as
he
had
come
to
his
bedroom
sylvia
was
still
sleeping
and
to
watch
for
her
to
wake
he
sat
down
again
by
the
fire
in
silence
only
stirred
by
the
frail
of
those
autumn
leaves
and
the
little
catch
in
her
breathing
now
and
then
it
was
less
troubled
than
when
he
had
bent
over
her
before
as
though
in
her
sleep
she
knew
he
must
not
miss
the
moment
of
her
waking
must
be
beside
her
before
she
came
to
full
consciousness
to
say
there
there
it
all
over
we
are
going
away
at
to
be
ready
to
offer
that
quick
solace
before
she
had
time
to
plunge
back
into
her
sorrow
was
an
island
in
this
black
sea
of
night
a
single
little
refuge
point
for
his
bereaved
and
naked
being
something
to
fixed
real
certain
and
yet
another
long
hour
before
her
waking
he
sat
forward
in
the
chair
with
that
wistful
eagerness
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
face
staring
through
it
at
some
vision
some
faint
glimmering
out
there
a
traveller
watches
a
star
