chapter
i
at
least
i
meant
well
when
the
dreadful
thing
occurred
that
night
every
one
turned
on
me
the
injustice
of
it
hurt
me
most
they
said
i
got
up
the
dinner
that
i
asked
them
to
give
up
other
engagements
and
come
that
i
promised
all
kinds
of
jollification
if
they
would
come
and
then
when
they
did
come
and
got
in
the
papers
and
every
one
but
ourselves
laughed
himself
black
in
the
face
they
turned
on
me
i
who
suffered
ten
times
to
their
one
i
shall
never
forget
what
dallas
brown
said
to
me
standing
with
a
coal
shovel
in
one
hand
and
a
well
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
tell
it
all
in
the
order
it
happened
it
began
with
jimmy
wilson
and
a
conspiracy
was
helped
on
by
a
piece
of
yellow
paper
and
a
japanese
butler
and
it
enmeshed
and
mixed
up
generally
ten
respectable
members
of
society
and
a
policeman
incidentally
it
involved
a
pearl
collar
and
a
box
of
soap
which
sounds
incongruous
doesn
t
it
it
is
a
great
misfortune
to
be
stout
especially
for
a
man
jim
was
rotund
and
looked
shorter
than
he
really
was
and
as
all
the
lines
of
his
face
or
what
should
have
been
lines
were
really
dimples
his
face
was
about
as
flexible
and
full
of
expression
as
a
pillow
in
a
tight
cover
the
angrier
he
got
the
funnier
he
looked
and
when
he
was
raging
and
his
neck
swelled
up
over
his
collar
and
got
red
he
was
entrancing
and
everybody
liked
him
and
borrowed
money
from
him
and
laughed
at
his
pictures
he
has
one
in
the
hargrave
gallery
in
london
now
so
people
buy
them
instead
and
smoked
his
cigarettes
and
tried
to
steal
his
jap
the
whole
story
hinges
on
the
jap
the
trouble
was
i
think
that
no
one
took
jim
seriously
his
ambition
in
life
was
to
be
taken
seriously
but
people
steadily
refused
to
his
art
was
a
huge
joke
except
to
himself
if
he
asked
people
to
dinner
every
one
expected
a
frolic
when
he
married
bella
knowles
people
chuckled
at
the
wedding
and
considered
it
the
wildest
prank
of
jimmy
s
career
although
jim
himself
seemed
to
take
it
awfully
hard
we
had
all
known
them
both
for
years
i
went
to
farmington
with
bella
and
anne
brown
was
her
matron
of
honor
when
she
married
jim
my
first
winter
out
jimmy
had
paid
me
a
lot
of
attention
he
painted
my
portrait
in
oils
and
had
a
studio
tea
to
exhibit
it
it
was
a
very
nice
picture
but
it
did
not
look
like
me
so
i
stayed
away
from
the
exhibition
jim
asked
me
to
he
said
he
was
not
a
photographer
and
that
anyhow
the
rest
of
my
features
called
for
the
nose
he
had
given
me
and
that
all
the
greuze
women
have
long
necks
i
have
not
after
i
had
refused
jim
twice
he
met
bella
at
a
camp
in
the
adirondacks
and
when
he
came
back
he
came
at
once
to
see
me
he
seemed
to
think
i
would
be
sorry
to
lose
him
and
he
blundered
over
the
telling
for
twenty
minutes
of
course
no
woman
likes
to
lose
a
lover
no
matter
what
she
may
say
about
it
but
jim
had
been
getting
on
my
nerves
for
some
time
and
i
was
much
calmer
than
he
expected
me
to
be
if
you
mean
i
said
finally
in
desperation
that
you
and
bella
are
are
in
love
why
don
t
you
say
so
jim
i
think
you
will
find
that
i
stand
it
he
brightened
perceptibly
i
didn
t
know
how
you
would
take
it
kit
he
said
and
i
hope
we
will
always
be
bully
friends
you
are
absolutely
sure
you
don
t
care
a
whoop
for
me
absolutely
i
replied
and
we
shook
hands
on
it
then
he
began
about
bella
it
was
very
tiresome
bella
is
a
nice
girl
but
i
had
roomed
with
her
at
school
and
i
was
under
no
illusions
when
jim
raved
about
bella
and
her
banjo
and
bella
and
her
guitar
i
had
painful
moments
when
i
recalled
bella
learning
her
two
songs
on
each
instrument
and
the
old
english
ballad
she
had
learned
to
play
on
the
harp
when
he
said
she
was
too
good
for
him
i
never
batted
an
eye
and
i
shook
hands
solemnly
across
the
again
and
wished
him
happiness
which
was
sincere
enough
but
hopeless
and
said
we
had
only
been
playing
a
game
but
that
it
was
time
to
stop
playing
jim
kissed
my
hand
and
it
was
really
very
touching
we
had
been
the
best
of
friends
ever
since
two
days
before
the
wedding
he
came
around
from
his
tailor
s
and
we
burned
all
his
letters
to
me
he
would
read
one
and
say
here
s
a
crackerjack
kit
and
pass
it
to
me
and
after
i
had
read
it
we
would
lay
it
on
the
firelog
and
jim
would
say
i
am
not
worthy
of
her
kit
i
wonder
if
i
can
make
her
happy
or
did
you
know
that
the
duke
of
belford
proposed
to
her
in
london
last
winter
of
course
one
has
to
take
the
woman
s
word
about
a
thing
like
that
but
the
duke
of
belford
had
been
mad
about
maude
richard
all
that
winter
you
can
see
that
the
burning
of
the
letters
which
was
meant
to
be
reminiscently
sentimental
a
sort
of
occasion
became
actually
a
two
hours
eulogy
of
bella
and
just
when
i
was
bored
to
death
the
mercer
girls
dropped
in
and
heard
jim
begin
to
read
one
commencing
dearest
and
the
next
day
after
the
rehearsal
dinner
they
told
bella
there
was
very
nearly
no
wedding
at
all
bella
came
to
see
me
in
a
frenzy
the
next
morning
and
threw
jim
and
his
odd
pounds
in
my
face
and
although
i
explained
it
all
over
and
over
she
never
quite
forgave
me
that
was
what
made
it
so
hard
later
the
situation
would
have
been
bad
enough
without
that
complication
they
went
abroad
on
their
wedding
journey
and
stayed
several
months
and
when
jim
came
back
he
was
fatter
than
ever
everybody
noticed
it
bella
had
a
gymnasium
fitted
up
in
a
corner
of
the
studio
but
he
would
not
use
it
he
smoked
a
pipe
and
painted
all
day
and
drank
beer
and
would
eat
starches
or
whatever
it
is
that
is
fattening
but
he
adored
bella
and
he
was
madly
jealous
of
her
at
dinners
he
used
to
glare
at
the
man
who
took
her
in
although
it
did
not
make
him
thin
bella
was
flirting
too
and
by
the
time
they
had
been
married
a
year
people
hitched
their
chairs
together
and
dropped
their
voices
when
they
were
mentioned
well
on
the
anniversary
of
the
day
bella
left
him
oh
yes
she
left
him
finally
she
was
intense
enough
about
some
things
and
she
said
it
got
on
her
nerves
to
have
everybody
chuckle
when
they
asked
for
her
husband
they
would
say
hello
bella
how
s
bubbles
still
banting
and
bella
would
try
to
laugh
and
say
he
swears
his
tailor
says
his
waist
is
smaller
but
if
it
is
he
must
be
growing
hollow
in
the
but
she
got
tired
of
it
at
last
well
on
the
second
anniversary
of
bella
s
departure
jimmy
was
feeling
pretty
glum
and
as
i
say
i
am
very
fond
of
jim
the
divorce
had
just
gone
through
and
bella
had
taken
her
maiden
name
again
and
had
had
an
operation
for
appendicitis
we
heard
afterward
that
they
didn
t
find
an
appendix
and
that
the
one
they
showed
her
in
a
glass
jar
was
not
hers
but
if
bella
ever
suspected
she
didn
t
say
whether
the
appendix
was
anonymous
or
not
she
got
box
after
box
of
flowers
that
were
and
of
course
every
one
knew
that
it
was
jim
who
sent
them
to
go
back
to
the
anniversary
i
went
to
rothberg
s
to
see
the
collection
of
antique
furniture
mother
was
looking
for
a
sideboard
for
father
s
birthday
in
march
and
i
met
jimmy
there
boring
into
a
in
a
bedpost
with
the
end
of
a
match
and
looking
his
nearest
to
sad
when
he
saw
me
he
came
over
i
m
blue
today
kit
he
said
after
we
had
shaken
hands
come
and
help
me
dig
bait
and
then
let
s
go
fishing
if
there
s
a
worm
in
every
hole
in
that
bedpost
we
could
go
into
the
fish
business
it
s
a
good
better
than
painting
i
asked
but
he
ignored
my
gibe
and
swelled
up
alarmingly
in
order
to
sigh
this
is
the
worst
day
of
the
year
for
me
he
affirmed
staring
straight
ahead
and
the
longest
look
at
that
crazy
clock
over
there
if
you
want
to
see
your
life
passing
away
if
you
want
to
see
the
steps
by
which
you
are
marching
to
eternity
watch
that
clock
marking
the
time
look
at
that
infernal
hand
staying
quiet
for
sixty
seconds
and
then
jumping
forward
to
catch
up
with
the
procession
ugh
see
here
jim
i
said
leaning
forward
you
re
not
well
you
can
t
go
through
the
rest
of
the
day
like
this
i
know
what
you
ll
do
you
ll
go
home
to
play
grieg
on
the
pianola
and
you
won
t
eat
any
he
looked
guilty
not
grieg
he
protested
feebly
you
re
not
going
to
do
either
i
said
with
firmness
you
are
going
right
home
to
unpack
those
new
draperies
that
harry
bayles
sent
you
from
shanghai
and
you
are
going
to
order
dinner
for
eight
that
will
be
two
tables
of
bridge
and
you
are
not
going
to
touch
the
he
did
not
seem
enthusiastic
but
he
rose
and
picked
up
his
hat
and
stood
looking
down
at
me
where
i
sat
on
an
old
covered
sofa
i
wish
to
thunder
i
had
married
you
he
said
savagely
you
re
the
finest
girl
i
know
kit
without
exception
and
you
are
going
to
throw
yourself
away
on
jack
manning
or
max
or
some
other
nothing
of
the
sort
i
said
coldly
and
the
fact
that
you
didn
t
marry
me
does
not
give
you
the
privilege
of
abusing
my
friends
anyhow
i
don
t
like
you
when
you
speak
like
jim
took
me
to
the
door
and
stopped
there
to
sigh
i
haven
t
been
well
he
said
heavily
don
t
eat
don
t
sleep
wouldn
t
you
think
i
d
lose
flesh
kit
he
lowered
his
voice
solemnly
i
have
gained
two
pounds
i
said
he
didn
t
look
it
which
appeared
to
comfort
him
somewhat
and
because
we
were
old
friends
i
asked
him
where
bella
was
he
said
he
thought
she
was
in
europe
and
that
he
had
heard
she
was
going
to
marry
reggie
wolfe
then
he
signed
again
muttered
something
about
ordering
the
funeral
baked
meats
to
be
prepared
and
left
me
that
was
my
entire
share
in
the
affair
i
was
the
victim
both
of
circumstances
and
of
their
plot
which
was
mad
on
the
face
of
it
during
the
entire
time
they
never
once
let
me
forget
that
i
got
up
the
dinner
that
i
telephoned
around
for
them
they
asked
me
why
i
couldn
t
cook
when
not
one
of
them
knew
one
side
of
a
range
from
the
other
and
for
anne
brown
to
talk
the
way
she
did
saying
i
had
always
been
crazy
about
jim
and
that
she
believed
i
had
known
all
along
that
his
aunt
was
coming
for
anne
to
talk
like
that
was
sheer
idiocy
yes
there
was
an
aunt
the
japanese
butler
started
the
trouble
and
aunt
selina
carried
it
along
chapter
ii
the
way
it
began
it
makes
me
angry
every
time
i
think
how
i
tried
to
make
that
dinner
a
success
i
canceled
a
theater
engagement
and
i
took
the
mercer
girls
in
the
electric
brougham
father
had
given
me
for
christmas
their
chauffeur
had
been
gone
for
hours
with
their
machine
and
they
had
telephoned
all
the
police
stations
without
success
they
were
afraid
that
there
had
been
an
awful
smash
they
could
easily
have
replaced
bartlett
as
lollie
said
but
it
takes
so
long
to
get
new
parts
for
those
foreign
cars
jim
had
a
house
well
and
it
stood
just
enough
apart
from
the
other
houses
to
be
entirely
maddening
later
it
was
a
affair
with
a
basement
kitchen
and
servants
dining
room
then
of
course
there
were
cellars
as
we
found
out
afterward
on
the
first
floor
there
was
a
large
square
hall
a
formal
reception
room
behind
it
a
big
living
room
that
was
also
a
library
then
a
den
and
back
of
all
a
georgian
dining
room
with
windows
high
above
the
ground
on
the
top
floor
jim
had
a
studio
like
every
other
one
i
ever
saw
perhaps
a
little
mussier
jim
was
really
a
grind
at
his
painting
and
there
were
cigarette
ashes
and
palette
knives
and
buffalo
rugs
and
shields
everywhere
it
is
strange
but
when
i
think
of
that
terrible
house
i
always
see
the
halls
enormous
covered
with
heavy
rugs
and
stairs
that
would
have
taken
six
housemaids
to
keep
in
proper
condition
i
dream
about
those
stairs
stretching
above
me
in
a
jacob
s
ladder
of
shining
wood
and
persian
carpets
going
up
up
clear
to
the
roof
the
dallas
browns
walked
they
lived
in
the
next
block
and
they
brought
with
them
a
man
named
harbison
that
no
one
knew
anne
said
he
would
be
great
sport
because
he
was
terribly
serious
and
had
the
most
exaggerated
ideas
of
society
and
loathed
extravagance
and
built
bridges
or
something
she
had
put
away
her
cigarettes
since
he
had
been
with
them
he
and
dallas
had
been
college
friends
and
the
only
chance
she
had
to
smoke
was
when
she
was
getting
her
hair
done
and
she
had
singed
off
quite
a
lot
a
burnt
offering
she
called
it
my
dear
she
said
over
the
telephone
when
i
invited
her
i
want
you
to
know
him
he
ll
be
crazy
about
you
that
type
of
man
big
and
deadly
earnest
always
falls
in
love
with
your
type
of
girl
the
appealing
sort
you
know
and
he
has
been
too
busy
up
to
now
to
know
what
love
is
but
mind
don
t
hurt
him
he
s
a
dear
boy
i
m
half
in
love
with
him
myself
and
dallas
trots
around
at
his
heels
like
a
but
all
anne
s
geese
are
swans
so
i
thought
little
of
the
harbison
man
except
to
hope
that
he
played
respectable
bridge
and
wouldn
t
mark
the
cards
with
a
steel
spring
under
his
finger
nail
as
one
of
her
finds
had
done
we
all
arrived
about
the
same
time
and
anne
and
i
went
upstairs
together
to
take
off
our
wraps
in
what
had
been
bella
s
dressing
room
it
was
anne
who
noticed
the
violets
look
at
that
she
nudged
me
when
the
maid
was
examining
her
wrap
before
she
laid
it
down
what
did
i
tell
you
kit
he
s
still
quite
mad
about
jim
had
painted
bella
s
portrait
while
they
were
going
up
the
nile
on
their
wedding
trip
it
looked
quite
like
her
if
you
stood
well
off
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
if
the
light
came
from
the
right
and
just
beneath
it
in
a
silver
vase
was
a
bunch
of
violets
it
was
really
touching
and
violets
were
fabulous
it
made
me
want
to
cry
and
to
shake
bella
soundly
and
to
go
down
and
pat
jim
on
his
generous
shoulder
and
tell
him
what
a
good
fellow
i
thought
him
and
that
bella
wasn
t
worth
the
dust
under
his
feet
i
don
t
know
much
about
psychology
but
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
just
what
effect
those
violets
and
my
sympathy
for
jim
had
in
influencing
my
decision
a
half
hour
later
it
is
not
surprising
under
the
circumstances
that
for
some
time
after
the
odor
of
violets
made
me
we
all
met
downstairs
in
the
living
room
quite
informally
and
dallas
was
banging
away
at
the
pianola
tramping
the
pedals
with
the
delicacy
and
feeling
of
a
football
center
rush
kicking
a
goal
harbison
was
standing
near
the
fire
a
little
away
from
the
others
and
he
was
all
that
anne
had
said
and
more
in
appearance
he
was
tall
not
too
tall
and
very
straight
and
after
one
got
past
the
oddity
of
his
face
being
above
his
white
collar
and
of
his
brown
hair
being
on
top
until
it
was
almost
yellow
one
realized
that
he
was
very
handsome
he
had
what
one
might
call
a
resolute
nose
and
chin
and
a
pleasant
rather
humorous
mouth
and
he
had
blue
eyes
that
were
at
that
moment
wandering
with
interest
over
the
lot
of
us
somebody
shouted
his
name
to
me
above
the
tristan
and
isolde
music
and
i
held
out
my
hand
instantly
i
had
the
feeling
one
sometimes
has
of
having
done
just
that
same
thing
with
the
same
surroundings
in
the
same
place
years
before
i
was
looking
up
at
him
and
he
was
staring
down
at
me
and
holding
my
hand
and
then
the
music
stopped
and
he
was
saying
where
was
it
where
was
what
i
asked
the
feeling
was
stronger
than
ever
with
his
voice
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
and
let
my
hand
drop
just
for
a
second
i
had
an
idea
that
we
had
met
before
somewhere
a
long
time
ago
i
suppose
no
it
couldn
t
have
happened
or
i
should
he
was
smiling
half
at
himself
no
i
smiled
back
at
him
it
didn
t
happen
i
m
afraid
unless
we
dreamed
we
i
felt
that
way
too
for
a
the
brushwood
boy
he
said
with
conviction
perhaps
we
will
find
a
common
dream
life
where
we
knew
each
other
you
remember
the
brushwood
boy
loved
the
girl
for
years
before
they
really
but
this
was
a
little
too
rapid
even
for
me
nothing
so
sentimental
i
m
afraid
i
retorted
i
have
had
exactly
the
same
sensation
sometimes
when
i
have
betty
mercer
captured
him
then
and
took
him
off
to
see
jim
s
newest
picture
anne
pounced
on
me
at
once
isn
t
he
delicious
she
demanded
did
you
ever
see
such
shoulders
and
such
a
nose
and
he
thinks
we
are
parasites
cumberers
of
the
earth
heaven
knows
what
he
says
every
woman
ought
to
know
how
to
earn
her
living
in
case
of
necessity
i
said
i
could
make
enough
at
bridge
and
he
thought
i
was
joking
he
s
a
dear
anne
was
enthusiastic
i
looked
after
him
oddly
enough
the
feeling
that
we
had
met
before
stuck
to
me
which
was
ridiculous
of
course
for
we
learned
afterward
that
the
nearest
we
ever
came
to
meeting
was
that
our
mothers
had
been
school
friends
just
then
i
saw
jim
beckoning
to
me
crazily
from
the
den
he
looked
quite
yellow
and
he
had
been
running
his
fingers
through
his
hair
for
heaven
s
sake
come
in
kit
he
said
i
need
a
cool
head
didn
t
i
tell
you
this
is
my
calamity
day
cook
gone
i
asked
with
interest
i
was
starving
he
closed
the
door
and
took
up
a
tragic
attitude
in
front
of
the
fire
did
you
ever
hear
of
aunt
selina
he
demanded
i
knew
there
was
one
i
ventured
mindful
of
certain
gossip
as
to
whence
jimmy
derived
the
wilson
income
jim
himself
was
too
worried
to
be
cautious
he
waved
a
brazen
hand
at
the
snug
room
at
the
japanese
prints
on
the
walls
at
the
rugs
at
the
teakwood
cabinets
and
the
screen
inlaid
with
pearl
and
ivory
all
this
he
said
comprehensively
every
bite
i
eat
clothes
i
wear
drinks
i
drink
you
needn
t
look
like
that
i
don
t
drink
so
darned
much
everything
comes
from
aunt
selina
buttons
he
finished
with
a
groan
selina
buttons
i
said
reflectively
i
don
t
remember
ever
having
known
any
one
named
buttons
although
i
had
a
cat
once
damn
the
cat
he
said
rudely
her
name
isn
t
buttons
her
name
is
caruthers
my
aunt
selina
caruthers
and
the
money
comes
from
oh
feebly
it
s
an
old
business
he
went
on
with
something
of
proprietary
pride
my
grandfather
founded
it
in
made
buttons
for
the
continental
oh
yes
i
said
they
melted
the
buttons
to
make
bullets
didn
t
they
or
they
melted
bullets
to
make
buttons
which
was
it
but
again
he
interrupted
it
s
like
this
he
went
on
hurriedly
aunt
selina
believes
in
me
she
likes
pictures
and
she
wanted
me
to
paint
if
i
could
i
d
have
given
up
long
ago
oh
i
know
what
you
think
of
my
work
but
for
aunt
selina
she
has
encouraged
me
and
she
s
done
more
than
that
she
s
paid
the
dear
aunt
selina
i
breathed
when
i
got
married
jim
persisted
aunt
selina
doubled
my
allowance
i
always
expected
to
sell
something
and
begin
to
make
money
and
in
the
meantime
what
she
advanced
i
considered
as
a
he
was
eyeing
me
defiantly
but
i
was
growing
serious
it
was
evident
from
the
preamble
that
something
was
coming
to
understand
kit
he
went
on
dubiously
you
would
have
to
know
her
she
won
t
stand
for
divorce
she
thinks
it
is
a
what
i
sat
up
i
have
always
regarded
divorce
as
essentially
disagreeable
like
castor
oil
but
necessary
oh
you
know
well
enough
what
i
m
driving
at
he
burst
out
savagely
she
doesn
t
know
bella
has
gone
she
thinks
i
am
living
in
a
little
domestic
heaven
and
she
is
coming
tonight
to
hear
me
flap
my
tonight
i
don
t
think
jimmy
had
known
that
dallas
brown
had
come
in
and
was
listening
i
am
sure
i
had
not
hearing
his
chuckle
at
the
doorway
brought
us
up
with
a
jerk
where
has
aunt
selina
been
for
the
last
two
or
three
years
he
asked
easily
jim
turned
and
his
face
brightened
europe
look
here
dal
you
re
a
smart
chap
she
ll
only
be
here
about
four
hours
can
t
you
think
of
some
way
to
get
me
out
of
this
i
want
to
let
her
down
easy
too
i
m
mighty
fond
of
aunt
selina
can
t
we
can
t
i
say
bella
has
a
headache
rotten
laconically
gone
out
of
town
jim
was
desperate
and
you
with
a
houseful
of
dinner
guests
try
again
i
have
it
jim
said
suddenly
dallas
ask
anne
if
she
won
t
play
hostess
for
tonight
be
wilson
pro
tem
anne
would
love
it
aunt
selina
never
saw
bella
then
afterward
next
year
when
i
m
hung
in
the
academy
and
can
stand
on
my
feet
not
if
you
re
hung
dallas
interjected
i
ll
break
the
truth
to
but
dallas
was
not
enthusiastic
anne
wouldn
t
do
at
all
he
declared
she
d
be
talking
about
the
kids
before
she
knew
it
and
patting
me
on
the
he
said
it
complacently
anne
flirts
but
they
are
really
devoted
one
of
the
mercer
girls
i
suggested
but
jimmy
raised
a
horrified
hand
you
don
t
know
aunt
selina
he
protested
i
couldn
t
offer
leila
in
the
gown
she
s
got
on
unless
she
wore
a
shawl
and
betty
is
too
anne
came
in
just
then
and
the
whole
story
had
to
be
told
again
to
her
she
was
ecstatic
she
said
it
was
good
enough
for
a
play
and
that
of
course
she
would
be
jimmy
for
that
length
of
time
you
know
she
finished
if
it
were
not
for
dal
i
would
be
jimmy
for
any
length
of
time
i
have
been
devoted
to
you
for
years
but
dallas
refused
peremptorily
i
m
not
jealous
he
explained
straightening
and
throwing
out
his
chest
but
well
you
don
t
look
the
part
anne
you
re
you
are
growing
matronly
not
but
what
you
suit
me
all
right
and
then
i
d
forget
and
call
you
mammy
which
would
require
explanation
i
think
it
s
up
to
you
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
i
snapped
it
s
ridiculous
i
dare
you
said
dallas
i
refused
i
stood
like
a
rock
while
the
storm
surged
around
me
and
beat
over
me
i
must
say
for
jim
that
he
was
merely
pathetic
he
said
that
my
happiness
was
first
that
he
would
not
give
me
an
uncomfortable
minute
for
anything
on
earth
and
that
bella
had
been
perfectly
right
to
leave
him
because
he
was
a
sinking
ship
and
deserved
to
be
turned
out
penniless
into
the
world
after
which
mixed
figure
he
poured
himself
something
to
drink
and
his
hands
were
shaking
dal
and
anne
stood
on
each
side
of
him
and
patted
him
on
the
shoulders
and
glared
across
at
me
i
felt
that
if
i
was
a
rock
jim
s
ship
had
struck
on
me
and
was
sinking
as
he
said
because
of
me
i
began
to
crumble
what
what
time
does
she
leave
i
asked
wavering
ten
nine
kit
are
you
going
to
do
it
no
i
gave
a
last
clutch
at
my
resolution
people
who
do
that
kind
of
thing
always
get
into
trouble
she
might
miss
her
train
she
s
almost
certain
to
miss
her
you
re
temporizing
dallas
said
sternly
we
won
t
let
her
miss
her
train
you
can
be
sure
of
jim
anne
broke
in
suddenly
hasn
t
she
a
picture
of
bella
there
s
not
the
faintest
resemblance
between
bella
and
jim
became
downcast
again
i
sent
her
a
miniature
of
bella
a
couple
of
years
ago
he
said
despondently
did
it
but
dal
said
he
remembered
the
miniature
and
it
looked
more
like
me
than
bella
anyhow
so
we
were
just
where
we
started
and
down
inside
of
me
i
had
a
premonition
that
i
was
going
to
do
just
what
they
wanted
me
to
do
and
get
into
all
sorts
of
trouble
and
not
be
thanked
for
it
after
all
which
was
entirely
correct
and
then
leila
mercer
came
and
banged
at
the
door
and
said
that
dinner
had
been
announced
ages
ago
and
that
everybody
was
famishing
with
the
hurry
and
stress
and
poor
jim
s
distracted
face
i
weakened
i
feel
like
a
cross
between
an
idiot
and
a
criminal
i
said
shortly
and
i
don
t
know
particularly
why
every
one
thinks
i
should
be
the
victim
for
the
sacrifice
but
if
you
will
promise
to
get
her
off
early
to
her
train
and
if
you
will
stand
by
me
and
not
leave
me
alone
with
her
i
i
might
try
of
course
we
ll
stand
by
you
they
said
in
chorus
we
won
t
let
you
stick
and
dal
said
you
re
the
right
sort
of
girl
kit
and
after
it
s
all
over
you
ll
realize
that
it
s
the
biggest
kind
of
lark
think
how
you
are
saving
the
old
lady
s
feeling
when
you
are
an
elderly
person
yourself
kit
you
will
appreciate
what
you
are
doing
yes
they
said
they
would
stand
by
me
and
that
i
was
a
heroine
and
the
only
person
there
clever
enough
to
act
the
part
and
that
they
wouldn
t
let
me
stick
i
am
not
bitter
now
but
that
is
what
they
promised
oh
i
am
not
defending
myself
i
suppose
i
deserved
everything
that
happened
but
they
told
me
that
she
would
be
there
only
between
trains
and
that
she
was
deaf
and
that
i
had
an
opportunity
to
save
a
from
ruin
so
in
the
end
i
capitulated
when
they
opened
the
door
into
the
living
room
max
reed
had
arrived
and
was
helping
to
hide
a
decanter
and
glasses
and
somebody
said
a
cab
was
at
the
door
and
that
was
the
way
it
began
chapter
iii
i
might
have
known
it
the
minute
i
had
consented
i
regretted
it
after
all
what
were
jimmy
s
troubles
to
me
why
should
i
help
him
impose
on
an
unsuspecting
elderly
woman
and
it
was
only
putting
off
discovery
anyhow
sooner
or
later
she
would
learn
of
the
divorce
and
just
at
that
instant
my
eyes
fell
on
harbison
tom
harbison
as
anne
called
him
he
was
looking
on
with
an
amused
smile
while
people
were
rushing
around
hiding
the
roulette
wheel
and
things
of
which
miss
caruthers
might
disapprove
and
betty
mercer
was
on
her
knees
winding
up
a
toy
bear
that
max
had
brought
her
what
would
he
think
it
was
evident
that
he
thought
badly
of
us
already
that
he
was
contemptuously
amused
and
then
to
have
to
ask
him
to
lend
himself
to
the
deception
with
a
gasp
i
hurled
myself
after
jimmy
only
to
hear
a
strange
voice
in
the
hall
and
to
know
that
i
was
too
late
i
was
in
for
it
whatever
was
coming
it
was
aunt
selina
who
was
coming
along
the
hall
followed
by
jim
who
was
mopping
his
face
and
trying
not
to
notice
the
paralyzed
silence
in
the
library
aunt
selina
met
me
in
the
doorway
to
my
frantic
eyes
she
seemed
to
tower
above
us
by
at
least
a
foot
and
beside
her
jimmy
was
a
red
perspiring
cherub
here
she
is
jimmy
said
from
behind
a
temporary
eclipse
of
black
cloak
and
traveling
bag
he
was
on
top
of
the
situation
now
and
he
was
mendaciously
cheerful
he
had
not
said
here
is
my
that
would
have
been
a
lie
no
jimmy
merely
said
here
she
if
aunt
selina
chose
to
think
me
bella
was
it
not
her
responsibility
and
if
i
chose
to
accept
the
situation
was
it
not
mine
dallas
brown
came
forward
gravely
as
aunt
selina
folded
over
and
kissed
me
and
surreptitiously
patted
me
with
one
hand
while
he
held
out
the
other
to
miss
caruthers
i
loathed
him
we
always
expect
something
unusual
from
james
miss
caruthers
he
said
with
his
best
manner
but
this
this
is
beyond
our
wildest
well
it
s
too
awful
to
linger
over
anne
took
her
upstairs
and
into
bella
s
bedroom
it
was
a
fancy
of
jim
s
to
leave
that
room
just
as
bella
had
left
it
dusty
dance
cards
and
favors
hanging
around
and
a
pair
of
discarded
slippers
under
the
bed
i
don
t
think
it
had
been
swept
since
bella
left
it
i
believe
in
sentiment
but
i
like
it
brushed
and
dusted
and
the
cobwebs
off
of
it
and
when
aunt
selina
put
down
her
bonnet
it
stirred
up
a
cloud
that
made
her
cough
she
did
not
say
anything
but
she
looked
around
the
room
grimly
and
i
saw
her
run
her
finger
over
the
back
of
a
chair
before
she
let
hannah
the
maid
put
her
cloak
on
it
anne
looked
frightened
she
ran
into
bella
s
bath
and
wet
the
end
of
a
towel
and
when
hannah
was
changing
aunt
selina
s
collar
her
concession
to
evening
dress
anne
wiped
off
the
obvious
places
on
the
furniture
she
did
it
stealthily
but
aunt
selina
saw
her
in
the
glass
what
s
that
young
woman
s
name
she
asked
me
sharply
when
anne
had
taken
the
towel
out
to
hide
it
anne
brown
dallas
brown
i
replied
meekly
every
one
replied
meekly
to
aunt
selina
does
she
live
here
oh
no
i
said
airily
they
are
here
to
dinner
she
and
her
husband
they
are
old
friends
of
jim
s
and
seems
to
have
a
good
eye
for
dirt
said
aunt
selina
and
went
on
fastening
her
brooch
when
she
was
finally
ready
she
took
a
bead
purse
from
somewhere
about
her
waist
and
took
out
a
half
dollar
she
held
it
up
before
hannah
s
eyes
tomorrow
morning
she
said
sternly
you
take
off
that
white
cap
and
that
apron
and
that
black
henrietta
cloth
and
put
on
a
calico
wrapper
and
when
you
ve
got
this
room
aired
and
swept
wilson
will
give
you
hannah
took
two
steps
back
and
caught
hold
of
a
chair
she
stared
helplessly
from
aunt
selina
to
the
half
dollar
and
then
at
me
anne
was
trying
not
to
catch
my
eye
and
another
thing
aunt
selina
said
from
the
head
of
the
stairs
i
sent
those
towels
over
from
ireland
tell
her
to
wash
and
bleach
the
one
what
brown
used
as
a
anne
was
quite
crushed
as
we
went
down
the
stairs
i
turned
once
down
and
her
face
was
a
curious
mixture
of
guilt
and
hopeless
wrath
over
her
shoulder
i
could
see
hannah
and
puzzled
staring
after
us
jim
presented
everybody
and
then
he
went
into
the
den
and
closed
the
door
and
we
heard
him
unlock
the
cellarette
aunt
selina
looked
at
leila
s
bare
shoulders
and
said
she
guessed
she
didn
t
take
cold
easily
and
conversation
rather
languished
max
reed
was
looking
like
a
thundercloud
and
he
came
over
to
me
with
a
lowering
expression
that
i
had
learned
to
dread
in
him
what
fool
nonsense
is
this
he
demanded
what
in
the
world
possessed
you
kit
to
put
yourself
in
such
an
equivocal
position
unless
he
stopped
and
turned
a
little
white
unless
you
are
going
to
marry
i
am
sorry
for
max
he
is
such
a
nice
boy
and
good
looking
too
if
only
he
were
not
so
fierce
and
did
not
want
to
make
love
to
me
no
matter
what
i
do
max
always
disapproves
of
it
i
have
always
had
a
deeply
rooted
conviction
that
if
i
should
ever
in
a
weak
moment
marry
max
he
would
disapprove
of
that
too
before
i
had
done
it
very
long
are
you
he
demanded
narrowing
his
eyes
a
sign
of
unusually
bad
humor
am
i
what
going
to
marry
him
if
you
mean
jim
i
said
with
dignity
i
haven
t
made
up
my
mind
yet
besides
he
hasn
t
asked
aunt
selina
had
been
talking
woman
s
suffrage
in
front
of
the
fireplace
but
now
she
turned
to
me
is
this
the
vase
cousin
jane
whitcomb
sent
you
as
a
wedding
present
she
demanded
indicating
a
hideous
affair
on
the
mantel
it
came
to
me
as
an
inspiration
that
jim
had
once
said
it
was
an
ancestral
urn
so
i
said
without
hesitation
that
it
was
and
because
there
was
a
pause
and
every
one
was
looking
at
us
i
added
that
it
was
a
beautiful
thing
aunt
selina
sniffed
hideous
she
said
it
looks
like
cousin
jane
shape
and
then
she
looked
at
it
more
closely
pounced
on
it
turned
it
upside
down
and
shook
it
a
card
fell
out
which
dallas
picked
up
and
gave
her
with
a
bow
jim
had
come
out
of
the
den
and
was
dancing
wildly
around
and
beckoning
to
me
by
the
time
i
had
made
out
that
that
was
not
the
vase
cousin
jane
had
sent
us
as
a
wedding
present
aunt
selina
had
examined
the
card
then
she
glared
across
at
me
and
stooping
put
the
card
in
the
fire
i
did
not
understand
at
all
but
i
knew
i
had
in
some
way
done
the
unforgivable
thing
later
dal
told
me
it
was
her
card
and
that
she
had
sent
the
vase
to
jim
at
christmas
with
a
generous
check
inside
when
she
straightened
from
the
fireplace
it
was
to
a
new
theme
which
she
attacked
with
her
usual
vigor
the
vase
incident
was
over
but
she
never
forgot
it
she
proved
that
she
never
did
when
she
sent
me
two
vases
with
paul
and
virginia
on
them
when
i
that
is
later
on
the
cause
in
england
has
made
great
strides
she
announced
from
the
fireplace
soon
the
hand
that
rocks
the
cradle
will
be
the
hand
that
actually
rules
the
here
she
looked
at
me
i
m
not
up
on
such
things
max
said
blandly
having
recovered
some
of
his
good
humor
but
isn
t
it
usually
a
foot
that
rocks
the
cradle
aunt
selina
turned
on
him
and
harbison
who
were
standing
together
with
a
snort
what
have
you
or
you
ever
done
for
the
independence
of
woman
she
demanded
harbison
smiled
he
had
been
looking
rather
grave
until
then
we
have
at
least
remained
unmarried
he
retorted
and
then
dinner
was
again
announced
he
was
to
take
me
out
and
he
came
across
the
room
to
where
i
sat
collapsed
in
a
chair
and
bent
over
me
do
you
know
he
said
looking
down
at
me
with
his
clear
disconcerting
gaze
do
you
know
that
i
have
just
grasped
the
situation
there
was
such
a
noise
that
i
did
not
hear
your
name
and
i
am
only
realizing
now
that
you
are
my
hostess
i
don
t
know
why
i
got
the
impression
that
this
was
a
bachelor
establishment
but
i
did
odd
wasn
t
it
i
positively
couldn
t
look
away
from
him
my
features
seemed
frozen
and
my
eyes
were
glued
to
his
as
for
telling
him
the
truth
well
my
tongue
refused
to
move
i
intended
to
tell
him
during
dinner
if
i
had
an
opportunity
i
honestly
did
but
the
more
i
looked
at
him
and
saw
how
candid
his
eyes
were
and
how
stern
his
mouth
might
be
the
more
i
shivered
at
the
plunge
and
of
course
as
everybody
knows
now
i
didn
t
tell
him
at
all
and
every
moment
i
expected
that
awful
old
woman
to
ask
me
what
i
paid
my
cook
and
when
i
had
changed
the
color
of
my
hair
bella
s
being
black
dinner
was
a
half
hour
late
when
we
finally
went
out
jimmy
leading
off
with
aunt
selina
and
i
as
hostess
trailing
behind
the
procession
with
harbison
dallas
took
in
the
two
mercer
girls
for
we
were
one
man
short
and
max
took
anne
leila
mercer
was
so
excited
that
she
wriggled
and
as
for
me
the
candles
and
the
orchids
everything
danced
around
in
a
circle
and
i
just
seemed
to
catch
the
back
of
my
chair
as
it
flew
past
jim
had
ordered
away
the
wines
and
brought
out
some
weak
and
cheap
chianti
dallas
looked
gloomy
at
the
change
but
jim
explained
in
an
undertone
that
aunt
selina
didn
t
approve
of
expensive
vintages
naturally
the
meal
was
glum
enough
aunt
selina
had
had
her
dinner
on
the
train
so
she
spent
her
time
in
asking
me
questions
the
length
of
the
table
and
in
getting
acquainted
with
me
she
had
brought
a
bottle
of
some
sort
of
medicine
downstairs
with
her
and
she
took
a
while
she
talked
the
stuff
was
called
pomona
shall
i
ever
forget
it
it
was
harbison
who
first
noticed
takahiro
jimmy
s
jap
had
been
the
only
thing
in
the
menage
that
bella
declared
she
had
hated
to
leave
but
he
was
doing
the
strangest
things
his
little
black
eyes
shifted
nervously
and
he
looked
queer
what
s
wrong
with
him
harbison
asked
me
finally
when
he
saw
that
i
noticed
is
he
ill
then
aunt
selina
s
voice
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
bella
she
called
in
a
high
shrill
tone
do
you
let
james
eat
cucumbers
i
think
he
must
be
i
said
hurriedly
aside
to
harbison
see
how
his
hands
shake
but
selina
would
not
be
ignored
cucumbers
and
strawberries
she
repeated
impressively
i
was
saying
bella
that
cucumbers
have
always
given
james
the
most
fearful
indigestion
and
yet
i
see
you
serve
them
at
your
table
do
you
remember
what
i
wrote
you
to
give
him
when
he
has
his
dreadful
spells
i
was
quite
speechless
every
one
was
looking
and
no
one
could
help
it
was
clear
jim
was
racking
his
brain
and
we
sat
staring
desperately
at
each
other
across
the
candles
everything
i
had
ever
known
faded
from
me
eight
pairs
of
eyes
bored
into
me
harbison
s
politely
amused
i
don
t
remember
i
said
at
last
really
i
don
t
believe
aunt
selina
smiled
in
a
superior
way
now
don
t
you
recall
it
she
insisted
i
said
baking
soda
in
water
taken
internally
for
cucumbers
baking
soda
and
water
externally
rubbed
on
when
he
gets
that
dreadful
itching
strawberry
i
believe
the
dinner
went
on
somebody
asked
aunt
selina
how
much
she
had
paid
in
foreign
hotels
and
after
that
she
was
as
harmless
as
a
dove
then
half
way
through
the
dinner
we
heard
a
crash
in
takahiro
s
pantry
and
when
he
did
not
appear
again
jim
got
up
and
went
out
to
investigate
he
was
gone
quite
a
little
while
and
when
he
came
back
he
looked
worried
sick
he
replied
to
our
inquiring
glances
one
of
the
maids
will
come
in
they
have
sent
for
a
aunt
selina
was
for
going
out
at
once
and
fixing
him
up
as
she
put
it
but
dallas
gently
interfered
i
wouldn
t
miss
caruthers
he
said
in
the
deferential
manner
he
had
adopted
toward
her
you
don
t
know
what
it
may
be
he
s
been
looking
spotty
all
it
might
be
scarlet
fever
max
broke
in
cheerfully
i
say
scarlet
fever
on
a
mongolian
what
color
would
he
be
jimmy
what
do
yellow
and
red
make
green
orange
jim
said
shortly
i
wish
you
people
would
remember
that
we
are
trying
to
the
fact
was
however
that
no
one
was
really
eating
except
harbison
who
had
given
up
trying
to
understand
us
considering
no
doubt
our
subdued
excitement
as
our
normal
condition
ages
afterward
i
learned
that
he
thought
my
face
almost
tragic
that
night
and
that
he
supposed
from
the
way
i
glared
across
the
table
that
i
had
quarreled
with
my
husband
i
am
afraid
you
are
not
well
he
said
at
last
noticing
my
food
untouched
on
my
plate
we
should
not
have
come
any
of
i
am
perfectly
well
i
replied
feverishly
i
am
never
ill
i
i
ate
a
late
he
glanced
at
me
keenly
don
t
let
them
stay
and
play
bridge
tonight
he
urged
miss
caruthers
can
be
an
excuse
can
she
not
and
you
are
really
fagged
you
look
i
think
it
is
only
ill
humor
i
said
looking
directly
at
him
i
am
angry
at
myself
i
have
done
something
silly
and
i
hate
to
be
max
would
have
said
impossible
or
something
else
trite
the
harbison
man
looked
at
me
with
interested
serious
eyes
is
it
too
late
to
undo
it
he
asked
and
then
and
there
i
determined
that
he
should
never
know
the
truth
he
could
go
back
to
south
america
and
build
bridges
and
make
love
to
the
spanish
girls
or
are
they
spanish
down
there
and
think
of
me
always
as
a
married
woman
married
to
a
dilettante
artist
inclined
to
be
stout
the
artist
not
i
and
with
an
aunt
selina
caruthers
who
made
buttons
and
believed
in
the
cause
but
never
never
should
he
think
of
me
as
a
silly
little
fool
who
pretended
that
she
was
the
other
man
s
wife
and
had
a
lump
in
her
throat
because
when
a
really
nice
man
came
along
a
man
who
knew
something
more
than
polo
and
motors
she
had
to
carry
on
the
deception
to
keep
his
respect
and
be
sedate
and
matronly
and
see
him
change
from
perfect
open
admiration
at
first
to
a
attitude
at
last
it
can
never
be
undone
i
said
soberly
well
that
s
the
picture
as
nearly
as
i
can
draw
it
a
round
table
with
a
low
centerpiece
of
orchids
in
lavenders
and
pink
old
silver
candlesticks
with
filigree
shades
against
the
somber
wainscoting
nine
people
two
of
them
unhappy
jim
and
i
one
of
them
complacent
aunt
selina
one
puzzled
harbison
and
the
rest
hysterically
mirthful
add
one
sick
japanese
butler
and
grind
in
the
mills
of
the
gods
every
one
promptly
forgot
takahiro
in
the
excitement
of
the
game
we
were
all
playing
finally
however
aunt
selina
who
seemed
to
have
takahiro
on
her
mind
looked
up
from
her
plate
that
jap
was
speckled
she
asserted
i
wouldn
t
be
surprised
if
it
s
measles
has
he
been
sniffling
james
has
he
been
sniffling
jim
threw
across
at
me
i
hadn
t
noticed
it
i
said
meekly
while
the
others
choked
max
came
to
the
rescue
she
refused
to
eat
it
he
explained
distinctly
and
to
everybody
apropos
absolutely
of
nothing
it
said
on
the
box
ready
cooked
and
she
declared
she
didn
t
care
who
cooked
it
but
she
wanted
to
know
who
predigested
as
every
one
wanted
to
laugh
every
one
did
it
then
and
under
cover
of
the
noise
i
caught
anne
s
eye
and
we
left
the
dining
room
the
men
stayed
and
by
the
very
firmness
with
which
the
door
closed
behind
us
i
knew
that
dallas
and
max
were
bringing
out
the
bottles
that
takahiro
had
hidden
i
was
seething
when
aunt
selina
indicated
a
desire
to
go
over
the
house
it
was
natural
that
she
should
want
to
it
was
her
house
in
a
way
i
excused
myself
for
a
minute
and
flew
back
to
the
dining
room
it
was
as
i
had
expected
jim
hadn
t
cheered
perceptibly
and
the
rest
were
patting
him
on
the
back
and
pouring
things
out
for
him
and
saying
poor
old
jim
in
the
most
maddening
way
and
the
harbison
man
was
looking
more
and
more
puzzled
and
not
at
all
hilarious
i
descended
on
them
like
a
thunderbolt
that
s
it
i
cried
shrewishly
with
my
back
against
the
door
leave
her
to
me
all
of
you
and
pat
each
other
on
the
back
and
say
it
s
gone
splendidly
oh
i
know
you
every
one
harbison
got
up
and
pulled
out
a
chair
but
i
couldn
t
sit
i
folded
my
arms
on
the
back
after
a
while
i
suppose
you
ll
slip
upstairs
the
four
of
you
and
have
your
they
looked
guilty
but
i
will
block
that
right
now
i
am
going
to
stay
here
if
aunt
selina
wants
me
she
can
find
me
here
the
first
indication
those
men
had
that
harbison
didn
t
know
the
state
of
affairs
was
when
he
turned
and
faced
them
mrs
wilson
is
quite
right
he
said
gravely
we
re
a
selfish
lot
if
miss
caruthers
is
a
responsibility
let
us
share
to
arms
jim
said
with
an
affectation
of
lightness
as
they
put
their
glasses
down
and
threw
open
the
door
dal
s
retort
whose
was
lost
in
the
confusion
and
we
went
into
the
library
on
the
way
dallas
managed
to
speak
to
me
if
harbison
doesn
t
know
don
t
tell
him
he
said
in
an
undertone
he
s
a
queer
duck
in
some
ways
he
mightn
t
think
it
funny
i
choked
it
s
the
least
funny
thing
i
ever
experienced
deceiving
that
harbison
man
isn
t
so
bad
he
thinks
me
crazy
anyhow
he
s
been
staring
his
eyes
out
at
me
i
don
t
wonder
you
re
really
lovely
tonight
kit
and
you
look
like
a
but
to
deceive
that
harmless
old
lady
well
thank
goodness
it
s
nine
and
she
leaves
in
an
hour
or
but
she
didn
t
and
that
s
the
story
chapter
iv
the
door
was
closed
it
was
infuriating
to
see
how
much
enjoyment
every
one
but
jim
and
myself
got
out
of
the
situation
they
howled
with
mirth
over
the
feeblest
jokes
and
when
max
told
a
story
without
any
point
whatever
they
all
had
hysteria
immediately
after
dinner
aunt
selina
had
begun
on
the
family
connection
again
and
after
two
bad
breaks
on
my
part
jim
offered
to
show
her
the
house
the
mercer
girls
trailed
along
unwilling
to
lose
any
of
the
possibilities
they
said
afterward
that
it
was
terrible
she
went
into
all
the
closets
and
ran
her
hand
over
the
tops
of
doors
and
kept
getting
grimmer
and
grimmer
in
the
studio
they
came
across
a
life
study
jim
was
doing
and
she
shut
her
eyes
and
made
the
girls
go
out
while
he
covered
it
with
a
drapery
lollie
who
did
the
bacchante
dance
at
three
benefits
last
winter
and
was
learning
a
new
one
called
eve
when
they
heard
aunt
selina
on
the
second
floor
anne
dal
and
max
sneaked
up
to
the
studio
for
cigarettes
which
left
harbison
to
me
i
was
in
the
den
sitting
in
a
low
chair
by
the
wood
fire
when
he
came
in
he
hesitated
in
the
doorway
would
you
prefer
being
alone
or
may
i
come
in
he
asked
don
t
mind
being
frank
i
know
you
are
i
have
a
headache
and
i
am
sulking
i
said
unpleasantly
but
at
least
i
am
not
actively
venomous
come
so
he
came
in
and
sat
down
across
the
hearth
from
me
and
neither
of
us
said
anything
the
firelight
flickered
over
the
room
bringing
out
the
faded
hues
of
the
old
japanese
prints
on
the
walls
gleaming
in
the
eyes
of
the
dragon
on
the
screen
setting
a
grotesque
god
on
a
cabinet
to
nodding
and
it
threw
into
relief
the
strong
profile
of
the
man
across
from
me
as
he
stared
at
the
fire
i
am
afraid
i
am
not
very
interesting
i
said
at
last
when
he
showed
no
sign
of
breaking
the
silence
the
the
illness
of
the
butler
and
miss
caruthers
arrival
have
been
he
suddenly
roused
with
a
start
from
a
brown
reverie
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
i
oh
of
course
not
i
was
wondering
if
i
if
you
were
offended
at
what
i
said
earlier
in
the
evening
the
brushwood
boy
you
know
and
all
offended
i
repeated
puzzled
you
see
i
have
been
living
out
of
the
world
so
long
and
never
seeing
any
women
but
indian
squaws
so
there
were
no
spanish
girls
that
i
m
afraid
i
say
what
comes
into
my
mind
without
circumlocution
and
then
i
did
not
know
you
were
no
oh
no
i
said
hastily
but
of
course
the
more
a
woman
is
married
i
mean
you
can
not
say
too
many
nice
things
to
married
women
they
need
them
you
i
had
floundered
miserably
with
his
eyes
on
me
and
i
half
expected
him
to
be
shocked
or
to
say
that
married
women
should
be
satisfied
with
the
nice
things
their
husbands
say
to
them
but
he
merely
remarked
apropos
of
nothing
or
following
a
line
of
thought
he
had
not
voiced
that
it
was
trite
but
true
that
a
good
many
men
owed
their
success
in
life
to
their
wives
and
a
good
many
owe
their
wives
to
their
success
in
life
i
retorted
cynically
at
which
he
stared
at
me
again
it
was
then
that
the
real
complexity
of
the
situation
began
to
develop
some
one
had
rung
the
bell
and
been
admitted
to
the
library
and
a
maid
came
to
the
door
of
the
den
when
she
saw
us
she
stopped
uncertainly
even
then
it
struck
me
that
she
looked
odd
and
she
was
not
in
uniform
however
i
was
not
informed
at
that
time
about
bachelor
establishments
and
the
first
thing
she
said
when
she
had
asked
to
speak
to
me
in
the
hall
knocked
her
and
her
clothes
clear
out
of
my
head
evidently
she
knew
me
miss
mcnair
she
said
in
a
low
tone
there
is
a
lady
in
the
drawing
room
a
veiled
person
and
she
is
asking
for
can
you
not
find
him
i
asked
he
is
in
the
house
probably
in
the
the
girl
hesitated
excuse
me
miss
but
miss
caruthers
then
i
saw
the
situation
never
mind
i
said
close
the
door
into
the
drawing
room
and
i
will
tell
but
as
the
girl
turned
toward
the
doorway
the
person
in
question
appeared
in
it
and
raised
her
veil
i
was
perfectly
paralyzed
it
was
bella
bella
in
a
fur
coat
and
a
veil
with
the
most
tragic
eyes
i
ever
saw
and
entirely
white
except
for
a
dab
of
rouge
in
the
middle
of
each
cheek
we
stared
at
each
other
without
speech
the
maid
turned
and
went
down
the
hall
and
with
that
bella
came
over
to
me
and
clutched
me
by
the
arm
who
was
being
carried
out
into
that
ambulance
she
demanded
glaring
at
me
with
the
most
awful
intensity
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
bella
i
said
wriggling
away
from
her
fingers
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
here
i
thought
you
were
in
you
are
hiding
something
from
me
she
accused
it
is
jim
i
see
it
in
your
well
it
isn
t
i
snapped
it
seems
to
me
really
bella
that
you
and
jim
ought
to
be
able
to
manage
your
own
affairs
without
dragging
me
it
was
not
pleasant
but
if
she
was
suffering
so
was
i
jim
is
as
well
as
he
ever
was
he
s
upstairs
somewhere
i
ll
send
for
she
gripped
me
again
and
held
on
while
her
color
came
back
you
ll
do
nothing
of
the
kind
she
said
and
she
had
quite
got
hold
of
herself
again
i
do
not
want
to
see
him
i
hope
you
don
t
think
kit
that
i
came
here
to
see
james
wilson
why
i
have
forgotten
that
there
is
such
a
person
and
you
know
somebody
upstairs
laughed
and
i
was
growing
nervous
what
if
aunt
selina
should
come
down
or
harbison
come
out
of
the
den
why
did
you
come
then
bella
i
inquired
he
may
come
i
was
passing
in
the
motor
she
said
and
i
honestly
think
she
hoped
i
would
believe
her
and
i
saw
that
am
she
stopped
and
began
again
i
thought
jim
was
out
of
town
and
i
came
to
see
takahiro
she
said
brazenly
he
was
devoted
to
me
and
evans
is
going
to
leave
i
ll
tell
you
what
to
do
kit
i
ll
go
back
to
the
dining
room
and
you
send
taka
there
if
any
one
comes
i
can
slip
into
the
it
s
immoral
i
protested
it
s
immoral
to
steal
your
my
own
butler
she
broke
in
impatiently
you
re
not
usually
so
scrupulous
kit
hurry
i
hear
that
hateful
anne
so
we
slid
back
along
the
hall
and
i
rang
for
takahiro
but
no
one
came
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
bella
i
said
as
we
waited
and
bella
was
staring
around
the
room
i
think
you
ought
to
know
that
miss
caruthers
is
bella
shrugged
her
shoulders
well
thank
goodness
she
said
i
don
t
have
to
see
her
the
only
pleasant
thing
i
remember
about
my
year
of
married
life
is
that
i
did
not
meet
aunt
i
rang
again
but
still
there
was
no
answer
and
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
stillness
below
stairs
was
almost
oppressive
bella
was
noticing
things
too
for
she
began
to
fasten
her
veil
again
with
a
malicious
little
smile
one
of
the
things
i
remember
my
late
husband
saying
she
observed
was
that
he
could
manage
this
house
and
had
done
it
for
years
with
flawless
service
stand
on
the
bell
i
did
we
stood
there
with
the
table
just
as
it
had
been
left
between
us
and
waited
for
a
response
bella
was
growing
impatient
she
raised
her
eyebrows
she
is
very
handsome
bella
is
and
flung
out
her
chin
as
if
she
had
begun
to
enjoy
the
horrible
situation
i
thought
i
heard
a
rattle
of
silver
from
the
pantry
just
then
and
i
hurried
to
the
door
in
a
rage
but
the
pantry
was
empty
of
servants
and
full
of
dishes
and
all
the
lights
were
out
but
one
which
was
burning
dimly
i
could
have
sworn
that
i
saw
one
of
the
servants
duck
into
the
stairway
to
the
basement
but
when
i
got
there
the
stairs
were
empty
and
something
was
burning
in
the
kitchen
below
bella
had
followed
me
and
was
peering
over
my
shoulder
curiously
there
isn
t
a
servant
in
the
house
she
said
triumphantly
and
when
we
went
down
to
the
kitchen
she
seemed
to
be
right
it
was
in
disgraceful
order
and
one
of
the
bottles
of
wine
that
had
ben
banished
from
the
dining
room
sat
half
empty
on
the
floor
drunk
bella
said
with
conviction
but
i
didn
t
think
so
there
had
not
been
time
enough
for
one
thing
suddenly
i
remembered
the
ambulance
that
had
been
the
cause
of
bella
s
appearance
for
no
one
could
believe
her
silly
story
about
takahiro
i
didn
t
wait
to
voice
my
suspicion
to
her
i
simply
left
her
there
staring
helplessly
at
the
confusion
and
ran
upstairs
again
through
the
dining
room
past
jimmy
and
aunt
selina
past
leila
mercer
and
max
who
were
flirting
on
the
stairs
up
up
to
the
servants
bedrooms
and
there
my
suspicions
were
verified
there
was
every
evidence
of
a
hasty
flight
in
three
bedrooms
five
trunks
stood
locked
and
ominous
and
the
closets
yawned
with
open
doors
empty
bella
had
been
right
there
was
not
a
servant
in
the
house
as
i
emerged
from
the
untidy
emptiness
of
the
servants
wing
i
met
harbison
coming
out
of
the
studio
i
wish
you
would
let
me
do
some
of
this
running
about
for
you
wilson
he
said
gravely
you
are
not
well
and
i
can
t
think
of
anything
worse
for
a
headache
has
the
butler
s
illness
clogged
the
household
machinery
worse
i
replied
trying
not
to
breathe
in
gasps
i
wouldn
t
be
running
around
like
this
but
there
is
not
a
servant
in
the
house
they
have
gone
the
entire
that
s
odd
he
said
slowly
gone
are
you
sure
in
reply
i
pointed
to
the
servants
wing
trunks
packed
i
said
tragically
rooms
empty
kitchen
and
pantries
full
of
dishes
did
you
ever
hear
of
anything
like
it
never
he
asserted
it
makes
me
suspect
what
he
suspected
he
did
not
say
instead
he
turned
on
his
heel
without
a
word
of
explanation
and
ran
down
the
stairs
i
stood
staring
after
him
wondering
if
every
one
in
the
place
had
gone
crazy
then
i
heard
betty
mercer
scream
and
the
rest
talking
loud
and
laughing
and
harbison
came
up
the
stairs
again
two
at
a
time
how
long
has
that
jap
been
ailing
wilson
he
asked
i
i
don
t
know
i
replied
helplessly
what
is
the
trouble
anyhow
i
think
he
probably
has
something
contagious
he
said
and
it
has
scared
the
servants
away
as
brown
said
he
looked
spotty
i
suggested
to
your
husband
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
get
the
house
emptied
in
case
we
are
oh
yes
by
all
means
i
said
eagerly
i
couldn
t
get
away
too
soon
i
ll
go
and
get
my
then
i
stopped
why
the
man
wouldn
t
expect
me
to
leave
i
would
have
to
play
out
the
wretched
farce
to
the
end
i
ll
go
down
and
see
them
off
i
finished
lamely
and
we
went
together
down
the
stairs
just
for
the
moment
i
forgot
bella
altogether
i
found
aunt
selina
bonneted
and
cloaked
taking
a
stirrup
cup
of
pomona
for
her
nerves
and
the
rest
throwing
on
their
wraps
in
a
hurry
downstairs
max
was
telephoning
for
his
car
which
wasn
t
due
for
an
hour
and
jim
was
walking
up
and
down
swearing
under
his
breath
with
the
prospect
of
getting
rid
of
them
all
and
of
going
home
comfortably
to
try
to
forget
the
whole
wretched
affair
i
cheered
up
quite
a
lot
i
even
played
up
my
part
of
hostess
and
dallas
told
me
aside
that
i
was
a
brick
just
then
jim
threw
open
the
front
door
there
was
a
man
on
the
top
step
with
his
mouth
full
of
tacks
and
he
was
nailing
something
to
the
door
just
below
jim
s
florentine
bronze
knocker
and
standing
back
with
his
head
on
one
side
to
see
if
it
was
straight
what
are
you
doing
jim
demanded
fiercely
but
the
man
only
drove
another
tack
it
was
harbison
who
stepped
outside
and
read
the
card
it
said
smallpox
harbison
read
as
if
he
couldn
t
believe
it
then
he
turned
to
us
huddled
in
the
hall
it
seems
it
wasn
t
measles
after
all
he
said
cheerfully
i
move
we
get
into
reed
s
automobile
out
there
and
have
a
vaccination
party
i
suppose
even
you
blase
society
folk
have
not
exhausted
that
kind
of
but
the
man
on
the
step
spat
his
tacks
in
his
hand
and
spoke
for
the
first
time
no
you
don
t
he
said
not
on
your
life
just
step
back
please
and
close
the
door
this
house
is
chapter
from
the
tree
of
love
there
is
hardly
any
use
trying
to
describe
what
followed
anne
brown
began
to
cry
and
talk
about
the
children
she
went
to
europe
once
and
stayed
until
they
all
got
over
the
whooping
cough
and
dallas
said
he
had
a
pull
because
his
mill
controlled
i
forget
how
many
votes
and
the
thing
to
do
was
to
be
quiet
and
comfortable
and
we
would
get
out
in
the
morning
max
took
it
as
a
huge
joke
and
somebody
found
him
at
the
telephone
calling
up
his
club
the
mercer
girls
were
hysterically
giggling
and
aunt
selina
sat
on
a
chair
and
took
aromatic
spirits
of
ammonia
as
for
jim
he
had
collapsed
on
the
lowest
step
of
the
stairs
and
sat
there
with
his
head
in
his
hands
when
he
did
look
up
he
didn
t
dare
to
look
at
me
the
harbison
man
was
arguing
with
the
impassive
individual
on
the
top
step
outside
and
i
saw
him
get
out
his
pocketbook
and
offer
a
crisp
bundle
of
bills
but
the
man
from
the
board
of
health
only
smiled
and
tacked
at
his
offensive
sign
after
a
while
harbison
came
in
and
closed
the
door
and
we
stared
at
one
another
i
know
what
i
m
going
to
do
i
said
swallowing
a
lump
in
my
throat
i
m
going
to
get
out
through
a
basement
window
at
the
back
i
m
going
home
aunt
selina
gasped
jumping
up
and
almost
dropping
her
ammonia
bottle
my
dear
bella
home
jimmy
groaned
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
but
anne
brown
was
getting
over
her
tears
and
now
she
turned
on
me
in
a
temper
it
s
all
your
fault
she
said
i
was
going
to
stay
at
home
and
get
a
little
sleep
well
you
can
sleep
now
dallas
broke
in
there
ll
be
nothing
to
do
but
i
think
you
haven
t
grasped
the
situation
dal
i
said
icily
there
will
be
plenty
to
do
there
isn
t
a
servant
in
the
house
no
servants
everybody
cried
at
once
the
mercer
girls
stopped
giggling
holy
cats
max
stopped
in
the
act
of
hanging
up
his
overcoat
do
you
mean
why
i
can
t
shave
myself
i
ll
cut
my
head
you
ll
do
more
than
that
i
retorted
grimly
you
will
carry
coal
and
tend
fires
and
empty
ash
pans
and
when
you
are
not
doing
any
of
those
things
there
will
be
pots
and
pans
to
wash
and
beds
to
then
there
was
a
row
we
had
worked
back
to
the
den
now
and
i
stood
in
front
of
the
fireplace
and
let
the
storm
beat
around
me
and
tried
to
look
perfectly
cold
and
indifferent
and
not
to
see
harbison
s
shocked
face
no
wonder
he
thought
them
a
lot
of
savages
browbeating
their
hostess
the
way
they
did
it
s
a
fool
thing
anyhow
max
reed
wound
up
to
celebrate
the
anniversary
of
a
divorce
especially
here
he
caught
jim
s
eye
and
stopped
but
i
had
suddenly
remembered
bella
down
in
the
basement
could
anything
have
been
worse
and
of
course
she
would
have
hysteria
and
then
turn
on
me
and
blame
me
for
it
all
it
all
came
over
me
at
once
and
overwhelmed
me
while
anne
was
crying
and
saying
she
wouldn
t
cook
if
she
starved
for
it
and
aunt
selina
was
taking
off
her
wraps
i
felt
queer
all
over
and
i
sat
down
suddenly
harbison
was
looking
at
me
and
he
brought
me
a
glass
of
wine
it
won
t
be
so
bad
as
you
fear
he
said
comfortingly
there
will
be
no
danger
once
we
are
vaccinated
and
many
hands
make
light
work
they
are
pretty
raw
now
because
the
thing
is
new
to
them
but
by
morning
they
will
be
it
isn
t
the
work
it
is
something
entirely
different
i
said
and
it
was
bella
and
work
could
hardly
be
spoken
in
the
same
breath
if
i
had
only
turned
her
out
as
she
deserved
to
be
when
she
first
came
instead
of
allowing
her
to
carry
through
the
wretched
farce
about
seeing
takahiro
or
if
i
had
only
run
to
the
basement
the
moment
the
house
was
quarantined
and
got
her
out
the
areaway
or
the
coal
hole
and
now
time
was
flying
and
aunt
selina
had
me
by
the
arm
and
any
moment
i
expected
bella
to
pounce
on
us
through
the
doorway
and
the
whole
situation
to
explode
with
a
bang
it
was
after
eleven
before
they
were
rational
enough
to
discuss
ways
and
means
and
of
course
the
first
thing
suggested
was
that
we
all
adjourn
below
stairs
and
clean
up
after
dinner
i
could
have
slain
max
reed
for
the
notion
and
the
mercer
girls
for
taking
him
up
of
course
we
will
they
said
in
a
duet
what
a
lark
and
they
actually
began
to
pin
up
their
dinner
gowns
it
was
jim
who
stopped
that
oh
look
here
you
people
he
objected
i
m
not
going
to
let
you
do
that
we
ll
get
some
servants
in
tomorrow
i
ll
go
down
and
put
out
the
lights
there
will
be
enough
clean
dishes
for
it
was
lucky
for
me
that
they
started
a
new
discussion
then
and
there
about
who
would
get
the
breakfast
in
the
midst
of
the
excitement
i
slipped
away
to
carry
the
news
to
bella
she
was
where
i
had
left
her
and
she
had
made
herself
a
cup
of
tea
and
was
very
much
at
home
which
was
natural
do
you
know
she
said
ominously
that
you
have
been
away
for
two
hours
and
that
i
have
gone
through
agonies
of
nervousness
for
fear
jim
wilson
would
come
down
and
think
i
came
here
to
see
him
no
one
would
think
that
bella
i
soothed
her
everybody
knows
you
loathe
him
jim
she
looked
at
me
over
the
edge
of
her
cup
i
ll
run
along
now
she
said
since
takahiro
isn
t
here
and
if
jim
has
any
sense
at
all
he
will
clear
out
every
maid
in
the
house
i
never
saw
such
a
kitchen
in
all
my
life
well
lead
the
way
kit
i
suppose
they
are
deep
in
bridge
or
roulette
or
she
was
fixing
her
veil
and
i
saw
i
would
have
to
tell
her
personally
i
would
much
rather
have
told
her
the
house
was
on
fire
wait
a
minute
bella
i
said
you
see
something
queer
has
happened
you
know
this
is
the
anniversary
well
you
know
what
it
is
and
jim
was
awfully
glum
so
we
thought
we
would
come
what
are
you
driving
at
she
demanded
you
are
kit
what
s
the
matter
you
needn
t
think
i
mind
because
jim
has
a
jollification
to
celebrate
his
it
it
was
takahiro
in
the
ambulance
i
blurted
smallpox
we
bella
we
are
shut
in
she
didn
t
faint
she
just
sat
down
and
stared
at
me
and
i
stared
back
at
her
then
a
miserable
alarm
clock
on
the
table
suddenly
went
off
like
an
explosion
and
bella
began
to
laugh
i
knew
what
that
was
hysteria
she
always
had
attacks
like
that
when
things
went
wrong
i
was
quite
despairing
by
that
time
i
hoped
they
would
all
hear
her
and
come
downstairs
and
take
her
up
and
put
her
to
bed
like
a
christian
so
she
could
giggle
her
soul
out
but
after
a
bit
she
quieted
down
and
began
to
cry
softly
and
i
knew
the
worst
was
over
i
gave
her
a
shake
and
she
was
so
angry
that
she
got
over
it
altogether
kit
you
are
horrid
she
choked
don
t
you
see
what
a
position
i
am
in
i
am
not
going
upstairs
to
face
anne
and
the
rest
of
them
you
can
just
put
me
in
the
coal
isn
t
there
a
window
you
could
get
through
i
asked
desperately
locking
the
door
doesn
t
shut
up
a
whole
bella
s
courage
revived
at
that
and
she
said
yes
there
were
windows
plenty
of
them
only
she
didn
t
see
how
she
could
get
out
and
i
said
she
would
have
to
get
out
because
i
was
playing
bella
in
the
performance
and
i
didn
t
care
to
have
an
understudy
then
the
situation
dawned
on
her
and
she
sat
down
and
laughed
herself
weak
in
the
knees
of
course
she
wanted
to
stay
then
and
see
the
fun
out
but
i
was
firm
she
would
have
to
go
and
i
told
her
so
things
were
complicated
enough
without
her
well
we
looked
funny
no
doubt
bella
in
a
russian
pony
automobile
coat
over
the
black
satin
she
had
worn
at
the
clevelands
dinner
and
i
in
cream
lace
the
skirt
gathered
up
from
the
kitchen
floor
with
bella
s
ermine
pelerine
around
my
bare
shoulders
and
dishes
and
overturned
chairs
everywhere
bella
knew
more
about
the
lower
regions
of
her
than
i
would
have
thought
she
opened
a
door
in
a
corner
and
led
the
way
through
a
narrow
hall
past
the
refrigerating
room
to
a
huge
cemented
cellar
with
a
furnace
in
the
center
and
a
electric
lights
making
it
really
brilliant
get
a
chair
bella
said
over
her
shoulder
excitedly
i
can
get
out
easily
here
through
the
coal
hole
imagine
my
but
it
was
my
turn
to
grip
bella
from
behind
the
furnace
were
coming
the
most
terrible
sounds
rasping
noises
that
fairly
frayed
the
silk
of
my
nerves
we
stood
petrified
for
an
instant
then
bella
laughed
they
are
not
all
gone
she
said
carefully
some
one
is
asleep
we
tiptoed
to
where
we
could
see
around
the
furnace
and
sure
enough
some
one
was
asleep
there
only
it
was
not
one
of
the
servants
it
was
a
portly
policeman
with
a
newspaper
and
an
empty
plate
on
the
floor
on
one
side
and
a
champagne
bottle
on
the
other
he
had
slid
down
in
his
chair
with
his
chin
on
his
brass
buttons
and
his
helmet
had
rolled
a
dozen
feet
away
bella
had
to
clap
her
hand
over
her
mouth
fairly
caught
she
whispered
sartor
resartus
the
arrester
arrested
oh
jim
and
his
flawless
service
but
after
we
got
over
our
surprise
we
saw
the
situation
was
serious
the
policeman
was
threatening
to
awaken
once
he
stopped
snoring
to
yawn
noisily
and
we
beat
a
hasty
retreat
bella
switched
off
the
lights
in
a
hurry
and
locked
the
door
behind
us
we
hardly
breathed
until
we
were
back
in
the
kitchen
again
and
everything
quiet
and
then
jimmy
called
my
name
from
up
above
somewheres
i
am
going
to
call
him
down
bella
i
said
firmly
let
him
help
you
out
i
m
sure
i
don
t
see
why
i
should
have
all
this
when
the
two
of
you
oh
no
no
surely
kit
you
wouldn
t
be
so
cruel
she
whispered
pleadingly
you
know
what
he
would
think
he
oh
kit
let
them
all
get
settled
for
the
night
and
then
come
down
like
a
dear
and
help
me
out
i
know
loads
of
ways
honestly
i
if
i
leave
you
here
i
debated
what
about
the
policeman
never
mind
him
frantically
listen
there
s
jim
up
in
the
pantry
run
for
the
sake
of
heaven
so
i
ran
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
i
met
jimmy
very
crumpled
as
to
and
dejected
as
to
face
i
ve
been
hunting
everywhere
for
you
he
said
dismally
i
thought
you
had
added
to
the
general
merriment
by
falling
downstairs
and
breaking
your
i
went
past
him
with
my
chin
up
now
that
i
had
time
to
think
about
it
i
was
furiously
angry
with
him
kit
he
called
after
me
appealingly
but
i
would
not
hear
then
he
adopted
different
tactics
he
took
advantage
of
my
catching
my
foot
in
the
lace
of
my
gown
to
pass
me
and
to
stand
with
his
back
against
the
door
you
re
not
going
until
you
hear
me
kit
he
declared
miserably
in
the
first
place
for
all
you
are
down
on
me
is
it
my
fault
honestly
now
is
it
my
fault
i
refused
to
speak
i
was
coming
home
to
be
miserable
alone
he
went
on
and
oh
i
know
you
meant
well
kit
but
you
asked
all
these
crazy
people
perhaps
you
will
give
me
credit
for
some
things
i
said
wearily
i
did
not
give
takahiro
smallpox
for
instance
and
if
you
will
permit
me
to
mention
the
fact
aunt
selina
is
not
my
aunt
that
s
what
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
jimmy
went
on
wretchedly
trying
not
to
look
at
me
you
see
when
they
were
rowing
so
about
who
would
get
the
breakfast
i
never
saw
such
a
lot
of
people
half
of
them
never
touch
breakfast
but
of
course
now
they
want
all
kinds
of
things
when
they
were
talking
aunt
selina
said
she
knew
you
would
get
it
being
the
hostess
and
responsible
besides
knowing
where
things
are
he
had
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
orchids
and
he
looked
shrunken
actually
shrunken
i
thought
he
finished
you
might
give
me
a
few
pointers
now
and
i
could
come
down
in
the
morning
and
and
fuss
up
something
coffee
and
so
on
i
would
say
you
did
it
oh
hang
it
all
kit
why
don
t
you
say
something
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
i
demanded
that
i
love
to
cook
and
of
course
i
ll
fix
trays
and
carry
them
up
in
the
morning
to
anne
brown
and
leila
mercer
and
the
rest
and
that
i
will
have
the
shaving
water
ready
i
know
what
i
m
going
to
do
jimmy
said
with
a
sudden
resolution
aunt
selina
and
her
money
can
go
to
blazes
i
am
going
right
upstairs
and
tell
her
the
truth
tell
her
who
you
are
what
i
am
and
all
the
rest
of
he
opened
the
door
you
ll
do
nothing
of
the
kind
i
gasped
catching
him
in
time
don
t
you
dare
jimmy
wilson
why
what
would
they
think
of
me
after
letting
her
call
me
bella
and
him
jim
if
harbison
ever
learns
the
truth
i
i
will
take
poison
if
we
are
going
to
be
shut
up
here
together
we
will
have
to
carry
it
on
i
couldn
t
stand
the
in
spite
of
an
heroic
effort
jim
looked
relieved
they
have
been
hunting
for
the
linen
closet
he
said
more
cheerfully
and
there
will
be
room
enough
i
think
harbison
and
i
will
hang
out
in
the
studio
there
are
two
couches
there
i
m
afraid
you
ll
have
to
take
aunt
selina
certainly
i
said
coldly
that
was
the
way
it
was
all
along
whenever
there
was
something
to
do
that
no
one
else
would
undertake
any
unpleasant
responsibility
that
entire
mongrel
household
turned
with
one
gesture
and
pointed
its
finger
at
me
well
it
is
over
now
and
i
ought
not
to
be
bitter
considering
everything
it
was
quite
characteristic
of
that
memorable
evening
that
is
quite
novelesque
i
think
that
my
interview
with
jimmy
should
have
a
sensational
ending
he
was
terribly
down
of
course
and
as
i
was
trying
to
pass
him
to
get
to
the
door
he
caught
my
hand
you
re
a
girl
in
a
thousand
kit
he
said
forlornly
if
i
were
not
so
damnably
hopelessly
idiotically
in
love
with
somebody
else
i
should
be
crazy
about
don
t
be
maudlin
i
retorted
would
you
mind
letting
my
hand
go
i
felt
sure
bella
could
hear
oh
come
now
kit
he
implored
we
ve
always
got
along
so
well
it
s
a
shame
to
let
a
thing
like
this
make
us
bad
friends
aren
t
you
ever
going
to
forgive
me
never
i
said
promptly
when
i
once
get
away
i
don
t
want
ever
to
see
you
again
i
was
never
so
humiliated
in
my
life
i
loathe
you
then
i
turned
around
and
of
course
there
was
aunt
selina
with
her
eyes
protruding
until
you
could
have
knocked
them
off
with
a
stick
and
beside
her
very
red
and
uncomfortable
harbison
bella
she
said
in
a
shocked
voice
is
that
the
way
you
speak
to
your
husband
it
is
high
time
i
came
here
i
think
and
took
a
hand
in
this
oh
never
mind
aunt
selina
jim
said
with
a
sheepish
grin
kit
bella
is
tired
and
nervous
this
is
a
h
deuce
of
a
situation
no
er
servants
and
all
but
aunt
selina
did
mind
and
showed
it
she
pulled
the
unlucky
harbison
man
through
the
door
and
closed
it
and
then
stood
glaring
at
both
of
us
every
little
quarrel
is
an
apple
knocked
from
the
tree
of
love
she
announced
oratorically
this
was
a
very
little
quarrel
jim
said
edging
toward
the
door
a
a
green
apple
aunt
selina
a
colicky
little
green
but
she
was
not
to
be
diverted
bella
she
said
severely
you
said
you
loathed
him
you
didn
t
mean
but
i
do
i
cried
hysterically
there
isn
t
any
word
to
tell
how
i
how
i
detest
then
i
swept
past
them
all
and
flew
to
bella
s
dressing
room
and
locked
myself
in
aunt
selina
knocked
until
she
was
tired
then
gave
up
and
went
to
bed
that
was
the
night
anne
brown
s
pearl
collar
was
stolen
chapter
vi
a
mighty
poor
joke
of
course
one
knows
that
there
are
people
who
in
a
different
grade
of
society
would
be
shoplifters
and
pickpockets
when
they
are
restrained
by
obligation
or
environment
they
become
a
little
overkeen
at
bridge
or
take
the
wrong
sables
or
stuff
a
brush
into
a
muff
at
a
reception
you
remember
the
ivory
dressing
set
that
theodora
bucknell
had
fastened
with
fine
gold
chains
and
the
sensation
it
caused
at
the
bucknell
cotillion
when
van
zire
went
sweeping
to
her
carriage
with
two
feet
of
gold
chain
hanging
from
the
front
of
her
wrap
but
anne
s
pearl
collar
was
different
in
the
first
place
instead
of
three
or
four
hundred
people
the
suspicion
had
to
be
divided
among
ten
and
of
those
ten
at
least
eight
of
us
were
friends
and
the
other
two
had
been
vouched
for
by
the
browns
and
jimmy
it
was
a
horrible
for
the
necklace
was
gone
there
couldn
t
be
any
doubt
of
that
and
although
as
dallas
said
it
couldn
t
get
out
of
the
house
still
there
were
plenty
of
places
to
hide
the
thing
the
worst
of
our
trouble
really
originated
with
max
reed
after
all
for
it
was
max
who
made
the
silly
wager
over
the
telephone
with
dick
bagley
he
bet
five
hundred
even
that
one
of
us
at
least
would
break
quarantine
within
the
next
hours
and
of
course
that
settled
it
dick
told
it
around
the
club
as
a
joke
and
a
man
who
owns
a
newspaper
heard
him
and
called
up
the
paper
then
the
paper
called
up
the
health
office
after
setting
up
a
flaming
will
money
free
them
board
of
health
versus
it
was
almost
three
when
the
house
settled
down
nobody
had
any
night
clothes
although
finally
through
dallas
who
gave
them
to
anne
who
gave
them
to
the
rest
we
got
some
things
of
jimmy
s
and
i
was
still
dressed
the
house
was
perfectly
quiet
and
after
listening
carefully
i
went
slowly
down
the
stairs
there
was
a
light
in
the
hall
and
another
back
in
the
dining
room
and
i
got
along
without
any
trouble
but
the
pantry
where
the
stairs
led
down
was
dark
and
the
wretched
swinging
door
would
not
stay
open
i
caught
my
skirt
in
the
door
as
i
went
through
and
i
had
to
stop
to
loosen
it
and
in
that
awful
minute
i
heard
some
one
breathing
just
beside
me
i
had
stooped
to
my
gown
and
i
turned
my
head
without
straightening
i
couldn
t
have
raised
myself
to
an
erect
posture
for
my
knees
were
giving
way
under
me
and
just
at
my
feet
lay
the
still
glowing
end
of
a
match
i
had
to
swallow
twice
before
i
could
speak
then
i
said
sharply
who
s
there
the
man
was
so
close
it
is
a
wonder
i
had
not
walked
into
him
his
voice
was
right
at
my
ear
i
am
sorry
i
startled
you
he
said
quietly
i
was
afraid
to
speak
suddenly
or
move
for
fear
i
would
do
what
i
have
it
was
harbison
i
i
thought
you
were
it
is
very
late
i
managed
to
say
with
dry
lips
do
you
know
where
the
electric
switch
is
mrs
wilson
it
was
clear
he
had
not
known
me
before
why
no
don
t
you
i
am
all
confused
i
muttered
and
beat
a
retreat
into
the
dining
room
there
in
the
friendly
light
we
could
at
least
see
each
other
and
i
think
he
was
as
much
impressed
by
the
fact
that
i
had
not
undressed
as
i
was
by
the
fact
that
he
had
partly
he
wore
a
hideous
dressing
gown
of
jimmy
s
much
too
small
and
his
hair
parted
and
plastered
down
in
the
early
evening
stood
up
in
a
sort
of
brown
brush
all
over
his
head
he
was
trying
to
flatten
it
with
his
hands
it
must
be
three
o
clock
he
said
with
polite
surprise
and
the
house
is
like
a
barn
you
ought
not
to
be
running
around
with
your
arms
uncovered
wilson
surely
you
could
have
called
some
of
i
didn
t
wish
to
disturb
any
one
i
said
with
distinct
truth
i
suppose
you
are
like
me
he
said
the
novelty
of
the
situation
and
everything
i
got
to
thinking
things
over
and
then
i
realized
the
studio
was
getting
cold
so
i
thought
i
would
come
down
and
take
a
look
at
the
furnace
i
didn
t
suppose
any
one
else
would
think
of
it
but
i
lost
myself
in
that
pantry
stumbled
against
a
drawer
and
nearly
went
down
the
and
as
if
in
judgment
on
me
at
that
instant
came
two
rather
terrific
thumps
from
somewhere
below
and
inarticulate
words
shouted
rather
than
spoken
it
was
uncanny
of
course
coming
as
it
did
through
the
register
at
our
feet
harbison
looked
startled
oh
by
the
way
i
said
as
carelessly
as
i
could
in
the
excitement
i
forgot
to
mention
it
there
is
a
policeman
asleep
in
the
furnace
room
i
i
suppose
we
will
have
to
keep
him
now
i
finished
as
airily
as
possible
oh
a
policeman
in
the
cellar
he
repeated
staring
at
me
and
he
moved
toward
the
pantry
door
you
needn
t
go
down
i
said
feverishly
with
visions
of
bella
knowles
sitting
on
the
kitchen
table
surrounded
by
soiled
dishes
and
all
the
cheerless
aftermath
of
a
dinner
party
please
don
t
go
down
i
it
s
one
of
my
rules
never
to
let
a
stranger
go
down
to
the
kitchen
i
i
m
peculiar
that
way
and
besides
it
s
it
s
bang
crash
through
the
register
pipe
and
some
language
quite
articulate
then
silence
look
here
wilson
he
said
resolutely
what
do
i
care
about
the
kitchen
i
m
going
down
and
arrest
that
policeman
for
disturbing
the
peace
he
will
have
the
pipes
you
must
not
go
i
said
with
desperate
firmness
he
he
is
probably
in
a
very
dangerous
state
just
now
we
i
locked
him
the
harbison
man
grinned
and
then
became
serious
why
don
t
you
tell
me
the
whole
thing
he
demanded
you
ve
been
in
trouble
all
evening
and
you
can
trust
me
you
know
because
i
am
a
stranger
because
the
minute
this
crazy
quarantine
is
raised
i
am
off
to
the
argentine
republic
perhaps
he
said
chili
and
because
i
don
t
know
anything
at
all
about
you
you
see
i
have
to
believe
what
you
tell
me
having
no
personal
knowledge
of
any
of
you
to
go
on
now
tell
me
whom
have
you
hidden
in
the
cellar
besides
the
policeman
there
was
no
use
trying
to
deceive
him
he
was
looking
straight
into
my
eyes
so
i
decided
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
thing
anyhow
it
was
going
to
require
strength
to
get
bella
through
the
coal
hole
with
one
arm
and
restrain
the
policeman
with
the
other
come
i
said
making
a
sudden
resolution
and
led
the
way
down
the
stairs
he
said
nothing
when
he
saw
bella
for
which
i
was
grateful
she
was
sitting
at
the
table
with
her
arms
in
front
of
her
and
her
head
buried
in
them
and
then
i
saw
she
was
asleep
her
hat
and
veil
were
laid
beside
her
and
she
had
taken
off
her
coat
and
draped
it
around
her
she
had
rummaged
out
a
cold
pheasant
and
some
salad
and
had
evidently
had
a
little
supper
supper
and
a
nap
while
i
worried
myself
about
her
she
she
came
in
unexpectedly
something
about
the
butler
i
explained
under
my
breath
and
she
doesn
t
want
to
stay
she
is
on
bad
terms
with
with
some
of
the
people
upstairs
you
can
see
how
impossible
the
situation
i
doubt
if
we
can
get
her
out
he
said
as
if
the
situation
were
quite
ordinary
however
we
can
try
she
seems
very
comfortable
it
s
a
pity
to
rouse
here
the
prisoner
in
the
furnace
room
broke
out
afresh
it
sounded
as
though
he
had
taken
a
lump
of
coal
and
was
attacking
the
lock
harbison
followed
the
noise
and
i
could
hear
him
arguing
not
gently
another
sound
he
finished
and
you
won
t
get
out
of
here
at
all
unless
you
crawl
up
the
furnace
pipe
when
he
came
back
bella
was
rousing
she
lifted
her
head
with
her
eyes
shut
and
then
opened
them
one
at
a
time
blinked
and
sat
up
she
didn
t
see
him
at
first
you
wretch
she
said
ungratefully
after
she
had
yawned
do
you
know
what
time
it
is
and
that
then
she
saw
harbison
and
sat
staring
at
him
this
is
harbison
i
said
to
her
hastily
he
he
came
with
anne
and
dal
and
he
is
shut
in
by
that
time
bella
had
seen
how
handsome
he
was
and
she
took
a
hair
pin
out
of
her
mouth
and
arched
her
eyebrows
which
was
always
bella
s
best
pose
i
am
miss
knowles
she
said
sweetly
of
course
the
court
had
given
her
back
her
name
and
i
stopped
in
tonight
thinking
the
house
was
empty
to
see
about
a
a
butler
unfortunately
the
house
was
quarantined
just
at
that
time
and
here
i
am
surely
there
can
not
be
any
harm
in
helping
me
to
get
out
pleading
tone
i
have
not
been
exposed
to
any
contagion
and
in
the
exhausted
state
of
my
health
the
confinement
would
be
positively
she
rolled
her
eyes
at
him
and
i
could
see
she
was
making
an
impression
of
course
she
was
free
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
marry
again
but
i
will
say
this
bella
is
a
lot
better
looking
by
electric
light
than
she
is
the
next
morning
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
the
gentleman
who
built
bridges
and
looked
down
on
society
from
a
lofty
lonely
pinnacle
agreed
to
help
one
of
the
most
gleaming
members
of
the
aforesaid
society
to
outwit
the
law
it
took
about
fifteen
minutes
to
quiet
the
policeman
nobody
ever
knew
what
harbison
did
to
him
but
for
hours
he
was
quite
tractable
he
changed
after
that
but
that
comes
later
in
the
story
anyhow
the
harbison
man
went
upstairs
and
came
down
with
a
bagdad
curtain
and
a
cushion
to
match
and
took
them
into
the
furnace
room
and
came
out
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
and
then
we
were
ready
for
bella
s
escape
but
there
were
four
special
officers
and
three
reporters
watching
the
house
as
a
result
of
max
reed
s
idiocy
once
after
trying
all
the
other
windows
and
finding
them
guarded
we
discovered
a
little
bit
of
a
hole
in
an
corner
that
looked
like
a
ventilator
and
was
covered
with
a
heavy
wire
screen
no
prisoners
ever
dug
their
way
out
of
a
dungeon
with
more
energy
than
that
with
which
we
attached
that
screen
hacking
at
it
with
kitchen
knives
whispering
like
conspirators
being
scratched
with
the
ragged
edges
of
the
wire
frozen
with
the
cold
air
one
minute
and
boiling
with
excitement
the
next
and
when
the
wire
was
cut
and
bella
had
rolled
her
coat
up
and
thrust
it
through
and
was
standing
on
a
chair
ready
to
follow
something
outside
that
had
looked
like
a
barrel
moved
and
said
oh
i
wouldn
t
do
that
if
i
were
you
it
would
be
certain
to
be
undignified
and
probably
it
would
be
unpleasant
we
coaxed
and
pleaded
and
tried
to
bribe
and
that
happened
as
it
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
worst
things
we
had
to
endure
for
the
whole
conversation
came
out
the
next
afternoon
in
the
paper
with
the
most
awful
drawings
and
the
reporter
said
it
was
the
flashing
of
the
jewels
we
wore
that
first
attracted
his
attention
and
that
brings
me
back
to
the
robbery
for
when
we
had
crept
back
to
the
kitchen
and
bella
was
fumbling
for
her
handkerchief
to
cry
into
and
the
harbison
man
was
trying
to
apologize
for
the
language
he
had
used
to
the
reporter
and
i
was
on
the
verge
of
a
nervous
chill
well
it
was
then
that
bella
forgot
all
about
crying
and
jumped
and
held
out
her
arm
my
diamond
bracelet
she
screeched
look
i
ve
lost
well
we
went
over
every
inch
of
that
basement
until
i
knew
every
crack
in
the
flooring
every
spot
on
the
cement
and
bella
was
nasty
and
said
that
she
had
never
seen
that
part
of
the
house
in
such
condition
and
that
if
i
had
acted
like
a
sane
person
and
put
her
out
when
she
had
no
business
there
at
all
she
would
have
had
her
freedom
and
her
bracelet
and
that
if
we
were
playing
a
joke
on
her
as
if
we
felt
like
joking
we
would
please
give
her
the
bracelet
and
let
her
go
and
die
in
a
corner
she
felt
very
queer
at
four
o
clock
we
gave
up
it
s
gone
i
said
i
don
t
believe
you
wore
it
here
no
one
could
have
taken
it
there
wasn
t
a
soul
in
this
part
of
the
house
except
the
policeman
and
he
s
locked
at
five
o
clock
we
put
her
to
sleep
in
the
den
she
was
in
a
fearful
temper
and
i
was
glad
enough
to
be
able
to
shut
the
door
on
her
tom
harbison
that
was
his
name
helped
me
to
creep
upstairs
and
wanted
to
get
me
a
glass
of
ale
to
make
me
sleep
but
i
said
it
would
be
of
no
use
as
i
had
to
get
up
and
get
the
breakfast
the
last
thing
he
said
was
that
the
policeman
seemed
above
the
average
in
intelligence
and
perhaps
we
could
train
him
to
do
plain
cooking
and
dishwashing
i
did
not
go
to
sleep
at
once
i
lay
on
the
divan
in
bella
s
dressing
room
and
stared
at
the
picture
of
her
with
the
violets
underneath
i
couldn
t
see
what
there
was
about
bella
to
inspire
such
undying
devotion
but
i
had
to
admit
that
she
had
looked
handsome
that
night
and
that
the
harbison
man
had
certainly
been
impressed
at
seven
o
clock
jimmy
wilson
pounded
at
my
door
and
i
could
have
choked
him
joyfully
i
dragged
myself
to
the
door
and
opened
it
and
then
i
heard
excited
voices
everybody
seemed
to
be
up
but
aunt
selina
and
they
were
all
talking
at
once
anne
brown
was
in
the
corner
of
the
group
waving
her
hands
while
dallas
was
trying
to
hook
the
back
of
her
gown
with
one
hand
and
hold
a
blanket
around
himself
with
the
other
no
one
was
dressed
except
anne
and
she
had
been
up
for
an
hour
looking
in
shoes
and
under
the
corners
of
rugs
and
around
the
bed
clothing
for
her
jeweled
collar
when
she
saw
me
she
began
all
over
again
i
had
it
on
when
i
went
into
my
room
she
declared
and
i
put
it
on
the
dressing
table
when
i
undressed
i
meant
to
put
it
under
my
pillow
but
i
forgot
and
i
didn
t
sleep
well
i
was
awake
half
the
night
wasn
t
i
dal
then
when
the
clock
downstairs
in
the
hall
was
chiming
five
something
roused
me
and
i
sat
up
in
bed
it
was
still
dark
but
i
pinched
dal
and
said
there
was
somebody
in
the
room
you
remember
that
don
t
you
dal
i
thought
you
had
nightmare
he
said
sheepishly
i
lay
still
for
ages
it
seemed
to
me
and
then
the
door
into
the
hall
closed
i
heard
the
catch
click
i
turned
on
the
light
over
the
bed
then
and
the
room
was
empty
i
thought
of
my
collar
and
although
it
seemed
ridiculous
with
the
house
sealed
as
it
is
and
all
of
us
friends
for
years
well
i
got
up
and
looked
and
it
was
gone
no
one
spoke
for
an
instant
it
was
a
queer
situation
for
the
collar
was
gone
anne
s
red
eyes
showed
it
was
true
and
there
we
stood
every
one
of
us
a
miserable
picture
of
guilt
and
tried
to
look
innocent
and
debonair
and
unsuspicious
finally
jim
held
up
his
hand
and
signified
that
he
wanted
to
say
something
it
s
like
this
he
said
until
this
thing
is
cleared
up
for
heaven
s
sake
let
s
try
to
be
sane
if
every
fellow
thinks
the
other
fellow
did
it
this
house
will
be
a
nice
little
hell
to
live
in
and
if
anybody
here
he
glared
around
if
anybody
has
got
funny
and
is
hiding
those
jewels
i
want
to
say
that
he
d
better
speak
up
now
later
it
won
t
be
so
easy
for
him
it
s
a
mighty
poor
but
nobody
spoke
chapter
vii
we
make
an
omelet
it
was
betty
mercer
who
said
she
was
hungry
and
got
us
switched
from
the
delicate
subject
of
which
was
the
thief
to
the
quite
as
pressing
subject
of
which
was
to
be
cook
aunt
selina
had
slept
quietly
through
the
whole
thing
we
learned
afterward
that
she
customarily
slept
on
her
left
side
which
was
on
her
good
ear
we
gathered
in
the
dallas
browns
room
and
jimmy
proposed
a
plan
we
can
have
anything
sent
in
that
we
want
he
suggested
speciously
and
if
dal
doesn
t
make
good
with
the
city
fathers
you
girls
can
get
some
clothes
anyhow
then
we
can
have
dinner
sent
from
one
of
the
why
not
all
the
meals
max
suggested
i
hope
you
re
not
going
to
be
small
about
things
it
ought
to
be
easy
jim
persisted
ignoring
the
remark
for
nine
reasonably
intelligent
people
to
boil
eggs
and
make
coffee
which
is
all
we
need
for
breakfast
with
some
nine
of
us
dallas
said
wickedly
looking
at
tom
harbison
who
was
out
of
earshot
why
nine
of
us
i
thought
kit
here
otherwise
known
as
bella
was
going
to
show
off
her
housewifely
it
ended
however
with
harbison
writing
out
a
lot
of
slips
cook
and
butler
and
as
that
left
two
people
over
we
didn
t
count
aunt
selina
he
added
another
and
a
trained
nurse
betty
mercer
drew
the
trained
nurse
slip
and
of
course
she
was
delighted
it
seems
funny
now
to
look
back
and
think
what
a
dreadful
time
she
really
had
for
aunt
selina
took
the
grippe
you
know
that
very
day
it
was
fate
that
i
should
go
back
to
that
awful
kitchen
for
of
course
my
slip
said
harbison
was
butler
and
max
and
dal
got
the
furnace
although
neither
of
them
had
ever
been
nearer
to
a
bucket
of
coal
than
the
coupons
on
mining
stock
anne
got
the
bedrooms
and
leila
was
it
was
jimmy
who
got
the
scullery
work
but
he
was
quite
crushed
by
this
time
and
did
not
protest
at
all
max
was
in
a
very
bad
temper
i
suppose
he
had
not
had
enough
sleep
no
one
had
but
he
came
over
while
the
lottery
was
going
on
and
stood
over
me
and
demanded
unpleasantly
in
a
whisper
that
i
stop
masquerading
as
another
man
s
wife
and
generally
making
a
fool
of
myself
which
is
the
way
he
put
it
and
i
knew
in
my
heart
that
he
was
right
and
i
hated
him
for
it
why
don
t
you
go
and
tell
him
them
i
asked
nastily
no
one
was
paying
any
attention
to
us
tell
them
that
to
be
obliging
i
have
nearly
drowned
in
a
sea
of
lies
tell
them
that
i
am
not
only
not
married
but
that
i
never
intend
to
marry
tell
them
that
we
are
a
lot
of
idiots
with
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
trifle
with
strangers
within
our
gates
people
who
build
i
mean
people
that
are
worth
two
to
our
one
run
and
tell
he
looked
at
me
for
a
minute
then
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
me
it
looked
as
though
max
might
be
going
to
be
difficult
while
i
was
improvising
an
apron
out
of
a
towel
and
anne
was
pinning
a
sheet
into
a
kimono
so
she
could
take
off
her
dinner
gown
and
still
be
proper
dallas
harked
back
to
the
robbery
ann
put
the
collar
on
the
table
there
he
said
there
s
no
mistake
about
that
i
watched
her
do
it
for
i
remember
thinking
it
was
the
sole
reminder
i
had
that
consolidated
traction
ever
went
above
max
was
looking
around
the
room
examining
the
window
locks
and
whistling
between
his
teeth
he
was
in
disgrace
with
every
one
for
by
that
time
it
was
light
enough
to
see
three
reporters
with
cameras
across
the
street
waiting
for
enough
sun
to
snap
the
house
and
everybody
knew
that
it
was
max
and
his
idiotic
wager
that
had
done
it
he
had
made
two
or
three
conciliatory
remarks
but
no
one
would
speak
to
him
his
antics
were
so
queer
however
that
we
were
all
watching
him
and
when
he
had
felt
over
the
rug
with
his
hands
and
raised
the
edges
and
tried
to
lift
out
the
chair
seats
and
had
shaken
out
dal
s
shoes
he
said
people
often
hid
things
and
then
forgot
about
it
he
made
a
proposition
if
you
will
take
that
infernal
furnace
from
around
my
neck
i
ll
undertake
either
to
find
the
jewels
or
to
show
up
the
thief
he
said
quietly
and
of
course
with
all
the
people
in
the
house
under
suspicion
every
one
had
to
hail
the
suggestion
with
joy
and
to
offer
his
assistance
and
jimmy
had
to
take
max
s
share
of
the
furnace
so
they
took
the
scullery
slip
downstairs
to
the
policeman
and
gave
jim
max
s
share
of
the
furnace
yes
i
had
broken
the
policeman
to
them
gently
of
course
anne
said
at
once
that
he
was
the
thief
but
they
found
him
tucked
in
and
sound
asleep
with
his
back
against
the
furnace
in
the
first
place
max
said
standing
importantly
in
the
middle
of
the
room
we
retired
between
two
and
three
nearer
three
so
the
theft
occurred
between
three
and
five
when
anne
woke
up
was
your
door
locked
dal
no
the
door
into
the
hall
was
but
the
door
into
the
dressing
room
was
open
and
we
found
the
door
from
there
into
the
hall
open
this
from
three
until
five
max
repeated
was
any
one
out
of
his
room
during
that
time
i
was
said
tom
harbison
promptly
from
the
foot
of
the
bed
i
was
prowling
all
around
somewhere
about
four
searching
he
glanced
at
me
for
a
drink
of
water
but
as
i
don
t
know
a
pearl
from
a
glass
bead
i
hope
you
exonerate
everybody
laughed
and
said
of
course
and
sure
old
man
and
changed
the
subject
quickly
while
that
excitement
was
on
i
got
jim
to
one
side
and
told
him
about
bella
his
face
was
radiant
at
first
i
suppose
she
did
come
to
see
takahiro
eh
kit
he
asked
delicately
she
didn
t
say
anything
about
me
nothing
good
she
said
the
house
was
in
a
disgraceful
condition
i
said
heartlessly
and
her
diamond
bracelet
was
stolen
while
she
took
a
nap
on
the
kitchen
table
he
groaned
and
oh
jim
you
are
such
a
goose
if
i
could
only
manage
my
own
affairs
the
way
i
could
my
friends
she
s
too
sure
of
you
jimmy
she
knows
you
adore
her
and
how
brutal
could
you
be
jim
fair
he
said
i
may
have
undiscovered
depths
of
brutality
that
i
have
never
had
occasion
to
use
however
i
might
try
why
listen
jim
i
urged
it
was
always
bella
who
did
things
here
she
managed
the
house
she
tyrannized
over
her
friends
and
she
bullied
you
yes
she
did
now
she
s
here
without
your
invitation
and
she
has
to
stay
it
s
your
turn
to
bully
to
dictate
terms
to
be
coldly
civil
or
politely
rude
make
her
furious
at
you
if
she
is
jealous
so
much
the
how
far
would
you
sacrifice
yourself
on
the
altar
of
friendship
he
asked
you
may
pay
me
all
the
attention
you
like
in
public
i
replied
and
after
we
shook
hands
we
went
together
to
bella
there
was
an
ominous
pause
when
we
went
into
the
den
bella
was
sitting
by
the
register
with
her
furs
on
and
after
one
glance
over
her
shoulder
at
us
she
looked
away
again
without
speaking
bella
jim
said
appealingly
and
then
i
pinched
his
arm
and
he
drew
himself
up
and
looked
properly
outraged
bella
he
said
coldly
this
time
i
can
t
imagine
why
you
have
put
yourself
in
this
ridiculous
position
but
since
you
have
she
turned
on
him
in
a
fury
put
myself
in
this
position
she
was
frantic
it
s
a
plot
a
wretched
trick
of
yours
this
quarantine
to
keep
me
jim
gasped
but
i
gave
him
a
warning
glance
and
he
swallowed
hard
on
the
contrary
he
said
with
maddening
quiet
i
would
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
wish
to
perpetuate
an
indiscretion
of
yours
for
it
was
hardly
discreet
was
it
to
visit
a
bachelor
establishment
alone
at
ten
o
clock
at
night
as
far
as
my
plotting
to
keep
you
here
is
concerned
i
assure
you
that
nothing
could
be
further
from
my
mind
our
paths
were
to
be
two
parallel
lines
that
never
he
looked
at
me
for
approval
and
bella
was
choking
you
are
worse
that
i
ever
thought
you
she
stormed
i
thought
you
were
only
a
a
fool
now
i
know
you
for
a
brute
well
it
ended
by
jim
s
graciously
permitting
bella
to
remain
there
being
nothing
else
to
do
and
by
his
magnanimously
agreeing
to
keep
her
real
identity
from
aunt
selina
and
harbison
and
to
break
the
news
of
her
presence
to
anne
and
the
rest
it
created
a
sensation
beside
which
anne
s
pearls
faded
away
although
they
came
to
the
front
again
soon
enough
jim
broke
the
news
at
once
gathering
everybody
but
harbison
and
aunt
selina
in
the
upper
hall
he
was
palpitatingly
nervous
but
he
tried
to
carry
it
off
with
a
high
hand
it
s
unfortunate
he
said
looking
around
the
circle
of
faces
each
one
frozen
with
amazement
and
just
a
suspicion
perhaps
of
incredulity
it
s
particularly
unfortunate
for
her
you
all
know
how
she
is
and
if
the
papers
should
get
hold
of
it
well
we
ll
all
have
to
make
it
as
easy
as
we
can
for
with
jim
s
eyes
on
them
they
all
swallowed
the
butler
story
without
a
gulp
but
anne
was
indignant
it
s
like
bella
she
snapped
well
she
has
made
her
bed
and
she
can
lie
on
it
i
m
sure
i
shan
t
make
it
for
her
but
if
you
want
to
know
my
opinion
harbison
may
be
a
fool
but
you
can
t
ram
two
bellas
both
nee
knowles
down
miss
caruthers
throat
with
a
we
had
not
thought
of
that
before
and
every
one
looked
blank
finally
however
jim
said
bella
s
middle
name
was
constantia
and
we
decided
to
call
her
that
but
it
turned
out
afterward
that
nobody
could
remember
it
in
a
hurry
and
generally
when
we
wanted
to
attract
her
attention
we
walked
across
the
room
and
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
it
was
quicker
and
safer
the
name
decided
we
went
downstairs
in
a
line
to
welcome
bella
to
try
to
make
her
feel
at
home
and
to
forget
her
deplorable
situation
leila
had
worked
herself
into
a
really
sympathetic
frame
of
mind
poor
dear
she
said
on
the
way
down
now
don
t
grin
anybody
just
be
cordial
and
glad
to
see
her
i
hope
she
doesn
t
cry
you
know
the
spells
she
we
stopped
outside
the
door
and
everybody
tried
to
look
cheerful
and
sympathetic
and
not
grinny
which
was
as
hard
as
looking
as
if
we
had
had
a
cup
of
tea
and
then
jim
threw
the
door
open
and
we
filed
in
bella
was
comfortably
reading
by
the
fire
she
had
her
feet
up
on
a
stool
and
a
pillow
behind
her
head
she
did
not
even
look
at
us
for
a
minute
then
she
merely
glanced
up
as
she
turned
a
page
dear
me
she
said
mockingly
what
a
lot
of
frumps
you
all
are
i
had
hoped
it
was
some
one
with
my
then
she
went
on
reading
as
leila
said
afterward
that
kind
of
person
ought
to
be
divorced
aunt
selina
came
down
just
then
and
i
left
everybody
trying
to
explain
bella
s
presence
to
her
and
fled
to
the
kitchen
the
harbison
man
appeared
while
i
was
sitting
hopelessly
in
front
of
the
gas
range
and
showed
me
about
it
i
don
t
know
that
i
ever
saw
one
he
said
cheerfully
but
i
know
the
theory
likewise
by
the
same
token
this
tea
kettle
set
on
the
flame
will
boil
that
is
not
theory
however
that
is
early
knowledge
polly
put
the
kettle
on
we
ll
all
take
look
at
that
wilson
i
didn
t
fight
bacilli
with
boiled
water
at
chickamauga
for
and
then
he
let
out
the
policeman
and
brought
him
into
the
kitchen
he
was
a
large
man
and
his
face
was
a
curious
mixture
of
amazement
alarm
and
dignity
no
doubt
we
did
look
queer
still
in
parts
of
our
evening
clothes
and
i
in
the
white
silk
and
lace
petticoat
that
belonged
under
my
gown
with
a
yellow
and
black
pajama
coat
of
jimmy
s
as
a
sort
of
breakfast
jacket
this
is
officer
flannigan
harbison
said
i
explained
our
unfortunate
position
earlier
in
the
morning
and
he
is
prepared
to
accept
our
hospitality
flannigan
every
person
in
this
house
has
got
to
work
as
i
also
explained
to
you
you
are
appointed
dishwasher
and
scullery
the
policeman
looked
dazed
then
slowly
like
dawn
over
a
sleeping
lake
a
light
of
comprehension
grew
in
his
face
sure
he
said
laying
his
helmet
on
the
table
i
ll
be
glad
to
be
doing
anything
i
can
to
help
me
and
wilson
we
used
to
be
friends
it
s
many
the
time
i
ve
opened
the
carriage
door
for
her
and
she
with
her
head
in
the
air
and
for
all
that
the
pleasant
smile
when
any
one
around
her
was
having
a
party
and
wanted
a
special
officer
it
was
wilson
that
always
said
get
flannigan
officer
timothy
flannigan
he
s
your
my
heart
had
been
going
lower
and
lower
so
he
knew
bella
and
he
knew
i
was
not
bella
although
he
had
not
grasped
the
fact
that
i
was
usurping
her
place
the
odious
harbison
man
sat
on
the
table
and
swung
his
feet
i
wonder
if
you
know
he
said
looking
around
him
how
good
it
is
to
see
a
white
woman
so
perfectly
at
home
in
a
civilized
kitchen
again
after
two
years
of
food
cooked
by
a
filthy
indian
squaw
over
a
portable
stove
so
perfectly
at
home
i
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
stared
around
at
the
copper
things
hanging
up
and
the
rows
of
blue
and
white
crockery
and
the
dozens
and
hundreds
of
utensils
whose
names
i
had
never
even
heard
and
i
was
dazed
i
tried
with
some
show
of
authority
to
instruct
flannigan
about
gathering
up
the
soiled
things
and
after
listening
in
puzzled
silence
for
a
minute
he
stripped
off
his
blue
coat
with
a
tolerant
smile
lave
em
to
me
miss
he
said
the
miss
passed
unnoticed
i
mayn
t
give
em
a
turkish
bath
which
is
what
you
are
describin
but
i
ll
get
the
grease
off
all
right
i
always
clean
up
while
the
missus
is
in
bed
with
a
young
he
rolled
up
his
sleeves
found
a
brown
checked
gingham
apron
behind
the
door
and
tied
it
around
his
neck
with
the
ease
of
practice
then
he
cleared
off
the
plates
eating
what
appealed
to
him
as
he
did
so
and
stopping
now
and
again
for
a
chuckle
i
m
thinkin
he
said
once
stopping
with
a
dish
in
the
air
what
a
deuce
of
a
noise
there
will
be
when
the
vaccination
doctor
comes
around
this
mornin
in
a
week
every
one
of
us
will
be
nursin
a
sore
arm
or
walkin
on
one
leg
beggin
your
pardon
miss
the
last
time
the
force
was
vaccinated
i
asked
to
be
done
behind
me
ear
i
needed
me
legs
and
i
needed
me
arms
but
didn
t
need
me
head
much
he
threw
his
head
back
and
laughed
harbison
laughed
oh
we
were
very
cheerful
and
that
awful
stove
stared
at
me
and
the
kettle
began
to
hum
and
aunt
selina
sent
down
word
that
she
was
not
well
and
would
like
some
omelet
on
her
tray
omelet
i
knew
that
it
was
made
of
eggs
but
that
was
the
extent
of
my
knowledge
i
muttered
an
excuse
and
ran
upstairs
to
anne
but
she
was
still
sniffling
over
her
necklace
and
said
she
didn
t
know
anything
about
omelets
and
didn
t
care
food
would
choke
her
neither
of
the
mercer
girls
knew
either
and
bella
who
was
still
reading
in
the
den
absolutely
declined
to
help
i
don
t
know
and
i
wouldn
t
tell
you
if
i
did
you
can
get
yourself
out
as
you
got
yourself
in
she
said
nastily
the
simplest
thing
if
you
don
t
mind
my
suggesting
it
is
to
poison
the
coffee
and
kill
the
lot
of
us
only
if
you
decide
to
do
it
let
me
know
i
want
to
live
just
long
enough
to
see
jimmy
wilson
writhe
bella
is
the
kind
of
person
who
gets
on
one
s
nerves
she
finds
a
grievance
and
hugs
it
she
does
ridiculous
things
and
blames
other
people
and
she
flirts
i
went
downstairs
despondently
and
found
that
harbison
had
discovered
some
eggs
and
was
standing
helplessly
staring
at
them
omelet
eggs
eggs
omelet
that
s
the
extent
of
my
knowledge
he
said
when
i
entered
you
ll
have
to
come
to
my
it
was
then
that
i
saw
the
cook
book
it
was
lying
on
a
shelf
beside
the
clock
and
while
harbison
had
his
back
turned
i
got
it
down
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
domestic
type
of
woman
was
his
ideal
and
i
did
not
care
to
outrage
his
belief
in
me
so
i
took
the
cook
book
into
the
pantry
and
read
the
recipe
over
three
times
when
i
came
back
i
knew
it
by
heart
although
i
did
not
understand
it
i
will
tell
you
how
i
said
with
a
great
deal
of
dignity
and
since
you
want
to
help
you
may
make
it
he
was
delighted
fine
he
said
suppose
you
give
me
the
idea
first
then
we
ll
go
over
it
slowly
bit
by
bit
we
ll
make
a
big
fluffy
omelet
and
if
the
others
aren
t
around
we
ll
eat
it
well
i
said
trying
to
remember
exactly
you
take
two
eggs
two
he
repeated
two
eggs
for
ten
people
don
t
interrupt
me
i
said
irritably
if
if
two
isn
t
enough
we
can
make
several
omelets
one
after
the
he
looked
at
me
with
admiration
who
else
but
you
would
have
thought
of
that
he
remarked
well
here
are
two
eggs
what
next
separate
them
i
said
easily
no
i
didn
t
know
what
it
meant
i
hoped
he
would
i
said
it
as
casually
as
i
could
and
i
did
not
look
at
him
i
knew
he
was
staring
at
me
puzzled
separate
them
he
said
why
they
aren
t
fastened
together
then
he
laughed
oh
yes
of
course
when
i
looked
he
had
put
one
at
each
end
of
the
table
afraid
they
ll
quarrel
i
suppose
he
said
well
now
they
re
then
first
separate
then
beat
he
repeated
the
author
of
that
cook
book
must
have
had
a
mean
disposition
what
s
next
hang
them
he
looked
up
at
me
with
his
boyish
smile
separate
and
beat
i
repeated
if
i
lost
a
word
of
that
recipe
i
was
gone
it
was
like
saying
the
alphabet
i
had
to
go
to
the
beginning
every
time
mentally
well
he
reflected
you
can
t
beat
an
egg
no
matter
how
cruel
you
may
be
unless
you
break
it
he
picked
up
an
egg
and
looked
at
it
separate
he
reflected
ah
the
white
from
the
whatever
you
cooking
experts
call
it
the
yellow
exactly
i
exclaimed
light
breaking
on
me
of
course
i
knew
you
would
find
it
then
back
to
the
recipe
beat
until
well
mixed
then
fold
in
the
fold
he
questioned
it
looks
pretty
thin
to
fold
doesn
t
it
i
upon
my
word
i
never
heard
of
folding
an
egg
are
you
but
of
course
you
know
please
come
and
show
me
just
fold
them
in
i
said
desperately
it
isn
t
and
because
i
was
so
transparent
a
fraud
and
knew
he
must
find
me
out
then
i
said
something
about
butter
and
went
into
the
pantry
that
s
the
trouble
with
a
lie
somebody
asks
you
to
tell
one
as
a
favor
to
somebody
else
and
the
first
thing
you
know
you
are
having
to
tell
a
thousand
and
trying
to
remember
the
ones
you
have
told
so
you
won
t
contradict
yourself
and
the
very
person
you
have
tried
to
help
turns
on
you
and
reproaches
you
for
being
untruthful
i
leaned
my
elbows
despondently
on
the
shelf
of
the
kitchen
pantry
with
the
feet
of
a
guard
visible
through
the
high
window
over
my
head
and
waited
for
harbison
to
come
in
and
demand
that
i
fold
a
raw
egg
and
discover
that
i
didn
t
know
anything
about
cooking
and
was
just
as
useless
as
all
the
others
he
came
he
held
the
bowl
out
to
me
and
waved
a
fork
in
triumph
i
have
solved
it
he
said
or
rather
flannigan
and
i
have
solved
it
the
mixture
awaits
the
magic
touch
of
the
i
honestly
thought
i
could
do
the
rest
it
was
only
to
be
put
in
a
pan
and
browned
and
then
in
the
oven
three
minutes
and
i
did
it
properly
but
for
two
things
i
should
have
greased
the
pan
but
this
was
the
book
s
fault
it
didn
t
say
and
i
should
have
lighted
the
oven
the
latter
however
was
harbison
s
fault
as
much
as
mine
and
i
had
wit
enough
to
lay
it
to
on
the
part
of
both
of
us
after
that
aunt
selina
or
no
aunt
selina
we
decided
to
have
boiled
eggs
and
harbison
knew
how
to
cook
them
he
put
them
in
the
tea
kettle
and
then
went
to
look
at
the
furnace
and
officer
timothy
flannigan
ground
the
coffee
and
gave
his
opinion
of
the
board
of
health
in
no
stinted
terms
as
for
me
i
burned
my
fingers
and
the
toast
and
felt
myself
growing
hot
and
cold
for
i
was
going
to
be
found
out
as
soon
as
flannigan
grasped
the
situation
then
of
course
i
did
the
thing
that
caused
me
so
much
trouble
later
i
put
down
the
toaster
at
least
the
harbison
man
said
it
was
a
toaster
and
went
over
and
stood
in
front
of
the
policeman
i
don
t
suppose
you
will
understand
exactly
i
said
but
but
if
anything
occurs
to
to
make
you
think
i
am
not
that
things
are
not
what
they
seem
to
be
i
mean
what
i
say
they
are
you
will
understand
that
it
is
a
joke
won
t
you
a
joke
you
yes
that
was
what
i
said
i
know
it
sounds
like
a
raving
delirium
but
when
max
came
down
and
squizzled
some
bacon
as
he
said
and
told
flannigan
about
the
robbery
and
how
whether
it
was
a
joke
or
deadly
earnest
somebody
in
the
house
had
taken
anne
s
pearls
that
wretched
policeman
winked
at
me
solemnly
over
max
s
shoulder
oh
it
was
awful
and
to
add
to
my
discomfort
the
most
unpleasant
ideas
would
obtrude
themselves
what
was
harbison
doing
on
the
first
floor
of
the
house
that
night
ice
water
he
had
said
but
there
had
been
plenty
of
water
in
the
studio
and
he
had
told
me
it
was
the
furnace
harbison
came
back
in
a
half
hour
and
i
remembered
the
eggs
we
fished
them
out
of
the
tea
kettle
and
they
were
perfectly
hard
but
we
ate
them
the
doctor
from
the
board
of
health
came
that
morning
and
vaccinated
us
there
was
a
great
deal
of
excitement
and
aunt
selina
was
done
on
the
arm
as
she
did
not
affect
evening
clothes
this
was
entirely
natural
but
later
on
in
the
week
when
the
wretched
things
began
to
take
nobody
dared
to
limp
and
leila
made
a
terrible
break
by
wearing
a
bandage
on
her
left
arm
after
telling
aunt
selina
that
she
had
been
vaccinated
on
the
right
chapter
viii
correspondents
department
the
following
letters
were
found
in
the
house
post
box
after
the
lifting
of
the
quarantine
and
later
were
presented
to
me
by
their
writers
bound
in

dear
old
man
i
think
i
was
fully
a
week
trying
to
drive
out
of
my
mind
my
last
glimpse
of
you
with
your
sickly
grin
pretending
to
be
tickled
to
pieces
that
the
only
white
man
within
two
hundred
miles
of
your
shack
was
going
on
a
holiday
you
old
bluffer
i
used
to
hang
over
the
rail
of
the
steamer
on
the
way
up
and
see
you
standing
as
i
left
you
beside
the
car
with
its
mule
and
the
indian
driver
and
behind
you
a
million
miles
of
pampa
never
mind
jack
i
sent
yesterday
by
mail
steamer
the
cigarettes
pipes
and
tobacco
canned
goods
and
poker
chips
put
in
some
magazines
too
and
the
collars
don
t
know
about
the
ties
guess
it
won
t
matter
down
there
nothing
happened
on
the
trip
one
of
the
engines
broke
down
three
days
out
and
i
spent
all
my
time
below
decks
for
hours
chief
engineer
raving
with
s
got
the
engine
fixed
in
record
time
and
haven
t
got
my
hands
clean
yet
it
was
bully
with
this
i
send
the
papers
which
will
tell
you
how
i
happen
to
be
here
and
why
i
have
leisure
to
write
you
three
days
after
landing
if
the
situation
were
not
so
ridiculous
it
would
be
maddening
here
i
am
off
for
a
holiday
and
congratulating
myself
that
i
am
foot
free
and
heart
free
yes
my
friend
heart
free
here
i
am
shut
in
the
house
of
a
man
i
never
saw
until
last
night
and
wouldn
t
care
if
i
never
saw
again
with
a
lot
of
people
who
never
heard
of
me
who
are
almost
equally
vague
about
south
america
who
play
as
hard
at
bridge
as
i
ever
worked
at
building
one
forgive
this
won
t
you
the
novelty
has
gone
to
my
head
and
who
belong
to
the
very
class
of
extravagant
parasites
isn
t
that
what
we
called
them
that
you
and
i
used
to
revile
from
our
lofty
andean
pinnacle
to
come
down
to
earth
here
we
are
six
women
and
five
men
including
a
policeman
not
a
servant
in
the
house
and
no
one
who
knows
how
to
do
anything
they
are
really
immensely
interesting
these
people
they
all
know
each
other
very
well
and
it
is
jimmy
here
and
dal
there
dallas
brown
who
went
to
india
with
me
you
remember
my
speaking
of
him
and
they
are
good
natured
too
except
at
meal
times
the
little
hostess
wilson
took
over
the
cooking
and
although
luncheon
was
better
than
breakfast
the
food
still
leaves
much
to
the
imagination
i
wish
you
could
see
this
wilson
hal
you
would
change
a
whole
lot
of
your
ideas
she
is
a
thoroughbred
sure
enough
and
of
course
some
of
her
beauty
is
the
result
of
the
exquisite
care
about
which
you
and
i
still
from
our
andean
pinnacle
used
to
rant
but
the
fact
is
she
is
more
than
that
she
has
fire
and
pluck
no
end
if
you
could
have
seen
her
this
morning
standing
in
front
of
a
cold
kitchen
range
determined
to
conquer
it
and
had
seen
the
tilt
of
her
chin
when
i
offered
to
take
over
the
cooking
you
needn
t
grin
i
can
cook
and
you
know
it
you
would
understand
what
i
mean
it
was
so
clear
that
she
was
paralyzed
with
fright
at
the
idea
of
getting
breakfast
and
equally
clear
that
she
meant
to
do
it
by
the
way
i
have
learned
that
her
name
was
mcnair
before
she
married
this
artist
wilson
and
that
she
is
a
daughter
of
the
mcnair
who
financed
the
callao
branch
i
have
not
met
the
others
so
intimately
there
are
two
sisters
named
mercer
inclined
to
be
noisy
they
are
playing
roulette
in
the
next
room
now
one
is
small
and
dark
almost
hebraic
in
type
named
leila
and
called
lollie
the
other
larger
very
blonde
and
languishing
and
with
a
decided
preference
for
masculine
society
even
saving
the
mark
mine
dallas
brown
s
wife
good
looking
smokes
cigarettes
when
i
am
not
around
they
all
do
except
wilson
then
there
is
a
maiden
aunt
who
is
ill
today
with
grippe
and
excitement
and
a
miss
knowles
who
came
for
a
moment
last
night
to
see
wilson
was
caught
in
the
quarantine
see
papers
and
after
hiding
all
night
in
the
basement
is
sulking
all
day
in
her
room
her
presence
created
an
excitement
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
apparent
cause
from
the
fact
that
i
have
reason
to
know
that
my
artist
host
and
his
beautiful
wife
are
on
bad
terms
and
from
the
significant
glances
with
which
the
announcement
of
miss
knowles
presence
was
met
the
state
of
affairs
seems
rather
clear
wilson
impresses
me
as
a
spineless
sort
anyhow
and
when
the
lady
of
the
basement
shut
herself
away
from
the
rest
today
and
i
happened
on
jimmy
as
they
call
him
pleading
with
her
through
the
door
i
very
nearly
kicked
him
down
the
stairs
oh
yes
i
ll
keep
out
right
enough
it
isn
t
my
affair
by
the
way
after
the
quarantine
and
with
the
policeman
locked
in
the
furnace
room
a
pearl
necklace
and
a
diamond
bracelet
were
stolen
just
ten
of
us
to
divide
the
suspicion
upon
my
word
hal
it
s
the
queerest
situation
i
ever
heard
of
which
of
us
did
it
i
make
a
guess
that
not
a
few
of
us
are
fools
but
which
is
the
knave
the
worst
of
it
is
i
am
the
only
unaccredited
member
of
the
household
this
is
more
scandal
than
i
ever
wrote
in
my
life
lay
it
to
circumscribed
environment
and
the
lack
of
twenty
miles
over
the
pampa
before
breakfast
we
have
all
been
vaccinated
and
the
officious
gentlemen
from
the
board
of
health
have
taken
their
grins
and
their
formaldehyde
and
gone
ye
gods
how
we
cough
the
carlton
order
will
go
through
all
right
i
think
phoned
him
this
morning
if
it
does
old
man
we
will
take
a
month
in
september
and
explore
the
mercator
property
do
you
know
hal
i
have
been
thinking
lately
that
you
and
i
stick
too
close
to
the
grind
business
is
right
enough
but
what
s
the
use
of
spending
one
s
best
years
succeeding
in
everything
except
the
things
that
are
worth
while
i
ll
be
thirty
sooner
than
i
care
to
say
and
oh
well
you
won
t
understand
you
ll
sit
down
there
with
the
southern
cross
and
the
rest
of
the
infernal
astronomical
galaxy
looking
down
on
you
and
the
indians
chanting
in
the
village
and
you
will
think
i
have
grown
sentimental
i
have
not
you
and
i
down
there
have
been
looking
at
the
world
through
the
reverse
end
of
the
glass

a
bully
old
world

and
this
is
god

have
been
in
my
life
we
are
quarantined
a
lot
of
us
in
jim
wilson

his
irreproachable
jap

a
very
reproachable
thing

smallpox

get
excited
his
room
has
been
fumigated
and
we
have
been
vaccinated
i
am
well
and
happy
i
can
t
be
killed
in
a
railway
wreck
or
smashed
when
the
car
skids
unless
i
drown
myself
in
my
bath
or
jump
through
a
window
positively
nothing
can
happen
to
me
so
gather
up
all
your
maternal
anxieties
and
cast
them
to
the
bermuda
sharks
anne

at
it
she

i
have
telephoned
lizette
for
some
clothes

for
a
couple
of
weeks
although
dallas
promises
to
get
us
out
sooner
now
dear
do
go
ahead
and
have
a
nice
time
and
on
no
account
come
home
you
could
only
have
the
carriage
to
stop
in
front
of
the
house
and
wave
to
me
through
a
window
mother
i
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
you
know
who
is
down
there
and
this
is
awfully
delicate
mumsy
but
he
s
a
nice
boy
and
i
thought
i
liked
him
i
guess
you
know
he
has
been
rather
attentive
now
i
do
like
him
mumsy
but
not
the
way
i
thought
i
did
and
i
want
you
to
very
gently
of
course
to
discourage
him
a
little
you
know
how
i
mean
he
s
a
dear
boy
but
i
am
so
tired
of
people
who
don
t
know
anything
but
horses
and
motors
and
oh
yes
do
you
remember
a
girl
named
lucille
mellon
who
was
at
school
with
you
in
rome
and
that
she
married
a
man
named
harbison
well
her
son
is
here
he
builds
railroads
and
bridges
and
things
and
he
even
built
himself
an
automobile
down
in
south
america
because
he
couldn
t
afford
to
buy
one
and
burned
wood
in
it
wood
think
of
it
i
wired
father
in
chicago
for
fear
he
would
come
rushing
home
the
picture
in
the
paper
of
the
face
at
the
basement
window
is
supposed
to
be
harbison
but
of
course
it
isn
t
any
more
like
him
than
mine
is
like
me
anne

her
pearl

she

harbison
has
shown
me
a
little
he
was
a
soldier
in

but
we

are
a
terribly
ignorant
lot
mumsy
about
the
real
things
of

why

mccord

the
back
of
the
above
note
watch

dodds
chapter
ix
flannigan
s
find
the
most
charitable
thing
would
be
to
say
nothing
about
the
first
day
we
were
baldly
brutal
that
s
the
only
word
for
it
and
harbison
with
his
beautiful
courtesy
the
really
sincere
kind
tried
to
patch
up
one
quarrel
after
another
and
failed
he
rose
superbly
to
the
occasion
and
made
something
that
he
called
a
south
american
goulash
for
luncheon
although
it
was
too
salty
and
every
one
was
thirsty
the
rest
of
the
day
bella
was
horrid
of
course
she
froze
jim
until
he
said
he
was
going
to
sit
in
the
refrigerator
and
cool
the
butter
she
locked
herself
in
the
dressing
room
it
had
been
assigned
to
me
but
that
made
no
difference
to
bella
and
did
her
nails
and
took
three
different
baths
and
refused
to
come
to
the
table
and
of
course
jimmy
was
wild
and
said
she
would
starve
but
i
said
very
well
let
her
starve
not
a
tray
shall
leave
my
it
was
a
comfort
to
have
her
shut
up
there
anyhow
it
postponed
the
time
when
she
would
come
face
to
face
with
flannigan
aunt
selina
got
sick
that
day
as
i
have
said
i
was
not
so
bitter
as
the
others
i
did
not
say
that
i
wished
she
would
die
the
worst
i
ever
wished
her
was
that
she
might
be
quite
ill
for
some
time
and
yet
when
she
began
to
recover
she
was
dreadful
to
me
she
said
for
one
thing
that
it
was
the
eggs
and
the
state
of
the
house
that
did
it
and
when
i
said
that
the
grippe
was
a
germ
she
retorted
that
i
had
probably
brought
it
to
her
on
my
clothing
you
remember
that
betty
had
drawn
the
nurse
s
slip
and
how
pleased
she
had
been
about
it
she
got
up
early
the
morning
of
the
first
day
and
made
herself
a
lawn
cap
and
telephoned
out
for
a
white
nurse
s
uniform
that
is
of
course
for
a
white
uniform
for
a
nurse
she
really
looked
very
fetching
and
she
went
around
all
the
morning
with
a
red
cross
on
her
sleeve
and
a
saint
cecilia
expression
gathering
up
bottles
of
medicine
most
of
it
flesh
reducer
which
was
pathetic
and
closing
windows
for
fear
of
drafts
she
refused
to
help
with
the
house
work
and
looked
quite
exalted
but
by
afternoon
it
had
palled
on
her
somewhat
and
she
and
max
shook
dice
betty
was
really
pleased
when
aunt
selina
sent
for
her
she
took
in
a
bottle
of
cologne
to
bathe
her
brow
and
we
all
stood
outside
the
door
and
listened
betty
tiptoed
in
in
her
pretty
cap
and
apron
and
we
heard
her
cautiously
draw
down
the
shades
what
are
you
doing
that
for
aunt
selina
demanded
i
like
the
it
s
bad
for
your
poor
eyes
betty
s
tone
was
exactly
the
proper
bedside
pitch
low
and
sugary
sweet
and
low
sweet
and
low
wind
of
the
western
sea
dal
hummed
outside
put
up
those
window
shades
aunt
selina
s
voice
was
strong
enough
what
s
in
that
bottle
betty
was
still
mild
she
swished
to
the
window
and
raised
the
shade
i
m
so
sorry
you
are
ill
she
said
sympathetically
this
is
for
your
poor
aching
head
now
close
your
eyes
and
lie
perfectly
still
and
i
will
cool
your
there
s
nothing
the
matter
with
my
head
aunt
selina
retorted
and
i
have
not
lost
my
faculties
i
am
not
a
child
or
a
sick
cow
if
that
s
perfumery
take
it
we
heard
betty
coming
to
the
door
but
there
was
no
time
to
get
away
she
had
dropped
her
mask
for
a
minute
and
was
biting
her
lip
but
when
she
saw
us
she
forced
a
smile
she
s
ill
poor
dear
she
said
if
you
people
will
go
away
i
can
bring
her
around
all
right
in
two
hours
she
will
eat
out
of
my
eat
a
piece
out
of
your
hand
max
scoffed
in
a
whisper
we
waited
a
little
longer
but
it
was
too
painful
aunt
selina
demanded
a
mustard
foot
bath
and
a
hot
lemonade
and
her
back
rubbed
with
liniment
and
some
strong
black
tea
and
in
the
intervals
she
wanted
to
be
read
to
out
of
the
prayer
book
and
when
we
had
all
gone
away
there
came
the
most
terrible
noise
from
aunt
selina
s
room
and
every
one
ran
we
found
betty
in
the
hall
outside
the
door
crying
with
her
fingers
in
her
ears
and
her
cap
over
her
eye
she
said
she
had
been
putting
the
hot
water
bottle
to
aunt
selina
s
back
and
it
had
been
too
hot
just
then
something
hit
against
the
door
with
a
soft
thud
fell
to
the
floor
and
burst
for
a
trickle
of
hot
water
came
over
the
sill
she
won
t
let
me
hold
her
hand
betty
wailed
or
bathe
her
brow
or
smooth
her
pillow
she
thinks
of
nothing
but
her
stomach
or
her
back
and
when
i
try
to
make
her
bed
look
decent
she
spits
at
me
like
a
cat
everything
i
do
is
wrong
she
spilled
the
foot
bath
into
her
shoes
and
blamed
me
for
it
took
the
united
efforts
of
all
of
us
except
bella
who
stood
back
and
smiled
nastily
to
get
betty
back
into
the
sick
room
again
i
was
supremely
thankful
by
that
time
that
i
had
not
drawn
the
nurse
s
slip
with
dinner
ordered
in
from
one
of
the
clubs
and
the
omelet
ten
hours
behind
me
my
position
did
not
seem
so
unbearable
but
a
new
development
was
coming
while
betty
was
fussing
with
aunt
selina
max
led
a
search
of
the
house
he
said
the
necklace
and
the
bracelet
must
be
hidden
somewhere
and
that
no
crevice
was
too
small
to
neglect
we
made
a
formal
search
all
together
except
betty
and
aunt
selina
and
we
found
a
lot
of
things
in
different
places
that
jim
said
had
been
missing
since
the
year
one
but
no
jewels
nothing
even
suggesting
a
jewel
was
found
we
had
explored
the
entire
house
every
cupboard
every
chest
even
the
insides
of
the
couches
and
the
pockets
of
jim
s
clothes
which
he
resented
bitterly
and
found
nothing
and
i
must
say
the
situation
was
growing
rather
strained
some
one
had
taken
the
jewels
they
hadn
t
walked
away
it
was
flannigan
who
suggested
the
roof
and
as
we
had
tried
every
place
else
we
climbed
there
of
course
we
didn
t
find
anything
but
after
all
day
in
the
house
with
the
shutters
closed
on
account
of
reporters
the
air
was
glorious
it
was
february
but
quite
mild
and
sunny
and
we
could
look
down
over
riverside
drive
and
the
hudson
and
even
recognize
people
we
knew
on
horseback
and
in
cars
it
was
a
pathetic
joy
and
we
lined
up
along
the
parapet
and
watched
the
motor
boats
racing
on
the
river
and
tried
to
feel
that
we
were
in
the
world
as
well
as
of
it
but
it
was
very
hard
betty
had
been
making
tea
for
aunt
selina
and
of
course
when
she
heard
us
up
there
she
followed
tray
and
all
and
we
drank
aunt
selina
s
tea
and
had
the
first
really
nice
time
of
the
day
bella
had
come
up
too
but
she
was
still
standoffish
and
queer
and
she
stood
leaning
against
a
chimney
and
staring
out
over
the
river
after
a
little
harbison
put
down
his
cup
and
went
over
to
her
and
they
talked
quite
confidentially
for
a
long
time
i
thought
it
bad
taste
in
bella
under
the
circumstances
after
snubbing
dallas
and
max
and
of
course
treating
jim
like
the
dirt
under
her
feet
to
turn
right
around
and
be
lovely
to
harbison
it
was
hard
for
jim
max
came
and
sat
beside
me
and
flannigan
who
had
been
sent
down
for
more
cups
passed
tea
putting
the
tray
on
top
of
the
chimney
jim
was
sitting
grumpily
on
the
roof
with
his
feet
folded
under
him
playing
canfield
in
the
shadow
of
the
parapet
buying
the
deck
out
of
one
pocket
and
putting
his
winnings
in
the
other
he
was
watching
bella
too
and
she
knew
it
and
she
strained
a
point
to
captivate
harbison
any
one
could
see
that
and
that
was
the
picture
that
came
out
in
the
next
morning
s
papers
tea
cups
cards
and
all
for
when
some
one
looked
up
there
were
four
newspaper
photographers
on
the
roof
of
the
next
house
and
they
had
the
impertinence
to
thank
us
flannigan
had
seen
bella
by
that
time
but
as
he
still
didn
t
understand
the
situation
things
were
just
the
same
but
his
manner
to
me
puzzled
me
whenever
he
came
near
me
he
winked
prodigiously
and
during
all
the
search
he
kept
one
eye
on
me
and
seemed
to
be
amused
about
something
when
the
rest
had
gone
down
to
dress
for
dinner
which
was
being
sent
in
thank
goodness
i
still
sat
on
the
parapet
and
watched
the
darkening
river
i
felt
terribly
lonely
all
at
once
and
sad
there
wasn
t
any
one
any
nearer
than
father
in
the
west
or
mother
in
bermuda
who
really
cared
a
rap
whether
i
sat
on
that
parapet
all
night
or
not
or
who
would
be
sorry
if
i
leaped
to
the
dirty
bricks
of
the
next
not
that
i
meant
to
of
course
the
lights
came
out
across
the
river
and
made
purple
and
yellow
streaks
on
the
water
and
one
of
the
motor
boats
came
panting
back
to
the
yacht
club
coughing
and
gasping
as
if
it
had
overdone
down
on
the
street
automobiles
were
starting
and
stopping
cabs
rolling
doors
slamming
all
the
maddening
delightful
bustle
of
people
who
are
to
dine
out
to
dance
to
go
to
the
theater
to
do
any
of
the
thousand
possibilities
of
a
long
february
evening
and
above
them
i
sat
on
the
roof
and
cried
yes
cried
i
was
roused
by
some
one
coughing
just
behind
me
and
i
tried
to
straighten
my
face
before
i
turned
it
was
flannigan
his
double
row
of
brass
buttons
gleaming
in
the
twilight
excuse
me
miss
he
said
affably
but
the
boy
from
the
hotel
has
left
the
dinner
on
the
doorstep
and
run
the
cowardly
little
divil
what
ll
i
do
with
it
i
went
to
wilson
but
she
says
it
s
no
concern
of
flannigan
was
evidently
bewildered
you
d
better
keep
it
warm
flannigan
i
replied
you
needn
t
wait
i
m
but
he
did
not
go
if
if
you
ll
excuse
me
miss
he
said
don
t
you
think
ye
d
betther
tell
them
tell
them
what
the
whole
thing
the
joke
he
said
confidentially
coming
closer
it
s
been
great
sport
now
hasn
t
it
but
i
m
afraid
they
will
get
on
to
it
soon
and
some
of
them
might
not
be
agreeable
a
pearl
necklace
is
a
pearl
necklace
miss
and
the
lady
s
what
do
you
mean
i
gasped
you
don
t
think
why
flannigan
he
merely
grinned
at
me
and
thrust
his
hand
down
in
his
pocket
when
he
brought
it
up
he
had
bella
s
bracelet
on
his
palm
glittering
in
the
faint
light
where
did
you
get
it
between
relief
and
the
absurdity
of
the
thing
i
was
almost
hysterical
but
flannigan
did
not
give
me
the
bracelet
instead
it
struck
me
his
tone
was
suddenly
severe
now
look
here
miss
he
said
you
ve
played
your
trick
and
you
ve
had
your
fun
the
lord
knows
it
s
only
folks
like
you
would
play
april
fool
jokes
with
a
fortune
if
you
re
the
sinsible
little
woman
you
look
to
be
you
ll
put
that
pearl
collar
on
the
coal
in
the
basement
tonight
and
let
me
find
i
haven
t
got
the
pearl
collar
i
protested
i
think
you
are
crazy
where
did
you
get
that
bracelet
he
edged
away
from
me
as
if
he
expected
me
to
snatch
it
from
him
and
run
but
he
was
still
trying
in
an
elephantine
way
to
treat
the
matter
as
a
joke
i
found
it
in
a
drawer
in
the
pantry
he
said
among
the
dirty
linen
and
if
you
re
as
smart
as
i
think
you
are
i
ll
find
the
pearl
collar
there
in
the
morning
and
nothing
said
so
there
i
was
suspected
of
being
responsible
for
anne
s
pearl
collar
as
if
i
had
not
enough
to
worry
me
before
of
course
i
could
have
called
them
all
together
and
told
them
and
made
them
explain
to
flannigan
what
i
had
really
meant
by
my
delirious
speech
in
the
kitchen
but
that
would
have
meant
telling
the
whole
ridiculous
story
to
harbison
and
having
him
think
us
all
mad
and
me
a
fool
in
all
that
overcrowded
house
there
was
only
one
place
where
i
could
be
miserable
with
comfort
so
i
stayed
on
the
roof
and
cried
a
little
and
then
became
angry
and
walked
up
and
down
and
clenched
my
hands
and
babbled
helplessly
the
boats
on
the
river
were
yellow
horizontal
streaks
through
my
tears
and
an
early
searchlight
sent
its
shaft
like
a
tangible
thing
in
the
darkness
just
over
my
head
then
finally
i
curled
down
in
a
corner
with
my
arms
on
the
parapet
and
the
lights
became
more
and
more
prismatic
and
finally
formed
themselves
into
a
circle
that
was
bella
s
bracelet
and
that
kept
whirling
around
and
around
on
something
flat
and
not
that
was
flannigan
s
palm
chapter
x
on
the
stairs
i
was
roused
by
someone
walking
across
the
roof
the
cracking
of
tin
under
feet
and
a
comfortable
and
companionable
odor
of
tobacco
i
moved
a
very
little
and
then
i
saw
that
it
was
a
man
the
height
and
erectness
told
me
which
man
and
just
at
that
instant
he
saw
me
good
lord
he
ejaculated
and
throwing
his
cigar
away
he
came
across
quickly
why
wilson
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
here
i
thought
they
said
that
i
was
sulking
again
i
finished
disagreeably
perhaps
i
am
in
fact
i
m
quite
sure
of
you
are
not
he
said
severely
you
have
been
asleep
in
a
february
night
in
the
open
air
with
less
clothing
on
than
i
wear
in
the
i
had
got
up
by
this
time
refusing
his
help
and
because
my
feet
were
numb
i
sat
down
on
the
parapet
for
a
moment
oh
i
knew
what
i
looked
like
one
of
those
pictures
there
is
one
thing
about
you
that
is
comforting
i
sniffed
you
said
precisely
the
same
thing
to
me
at
three
o
clock
this
morning
you
never
startle
me
by
saying
anything
he
took
a
step
toward
me
and
even
in
the
dusk
i
could
see
that
he
was
looking
down
at
me
oddly
all
my
bravado
faded
away
and
there
was
a
queerish
ringing
in
my
ears
i
would
like
to
he
said
tensely
i
would
like
this
minute
i
m
a
fool
wilson
he
finished
miserably
i
ought
to
be
drawn
and
quartered
but
when
i
see
you
like
this
i
i
get
crazy
if
you
say
the
word
i
ll
i
ll
go
down
and
he
clenched
his
fist
it
was
reprehensible
of
course
he
saw
that
in
an
instant
for
he
shut
his
teeth
over
something
that
sounded
very
fierce
and
strode
away
from
me
to
stand
looking
out
over
the
river
with
his
hands
thrust
in
his
pockets
of
course
the
thing
i
should
have
done
was
to
ignore
what
he
had
said
altogether
but
he
was
so
uncomfortable
so
chastened
that
feline
feminine
whatever
the
instinct
is
i
could
not
let
him
go
i
had
been
so
wretched
myself
what
is
it
you
would
like
to
say
i
called
over
to
him
he
did
not
speak
would
you
tell
me
that
i
am
a
silly
child
for
pouting
no
reply
he
struck
a
match
or
would
you
preach
a
nice
little
sermon
about
people
about
women
loving
their
husbands
he
grunted
savagely
under
his
breath
be
quite
honest
i
pursued
relentlessly
say
that
we
are
a
lot
of
barbarians
say
that
because
my
because
jimmy
treats
me
outrageously
oh
he
does
any
one
can
see
that
and
because
i
loathe
him
and
any
one
can
tell
that
why
don
t
you
say
you
are
shocked
to
the
depths
i
was
a
little
shocked
myself
by
that
time
but
i
couldn
t
stop
having
started
he
came
over
to
me
and
towering
and
he
had
the
audacity
to
grip
my
arm
and
stand
me
on
my
feet
like
a
bad
child
which
i
was
i
dare
say
don
t
he
said
in
a
husky
very
pained
voice
you
are
only
talking
you
don
t
mean
it
it
isn
t
you
you
know
you
care
or
else
why
are
you
crying
up
here
and
don
t
do
it
again
don
t
do
it
again
or
i
will
you
will
what
make
a
fool
of
myself
as
i
have
now
he
finished
grimly
and
then
he
stalked
away
and
left
me
there
alone
completely
bewildered
to
find
my
way
down
in
the
dark
i
groped
along
holding
to
the
rail
for
the
staircase
to
the
roof
was
very
steep
and
i
went
slowly
down
the
stairs
there
was
a
tiny
landing
and
i
stopped
i
could
have
sworn
i
heard
harbison
s
footsteps
far
below
growing
fainter
i
even
smiled
a
little
there
in
the
dark
although
i
had
been
rather
profoundly
shaken
the
next
instant
i
knew
i
had
been
wrong
some
one
was
on
the
landing
with
me
i
could
hear
short
sharp
breathing
and
then
i
am
not
sure
that
i
struggled
in
fact
i
don
t
believe
i
did
i
was
too
limp
with
amazement
the
creature
to
have
lain
in
wait
for
me
like
that
and
he
was
brutally
strong
he
caught
me
to
him
fiercely
and
held
me
there
close
and
he
kissed
me
not
once
or
twice
but
half
a
dozen
times
long
kisses
that
filled
me
with
hot
shame
for
him
for
myself
that
i
had
liked
him
the
roughness
of
his
coat
bruised
my
cheek
i
loathed
him
and
then
someone
came
whistling
along
the
hall
below
and
he
pushed
me
from
him
and
stood
listening
breathing
in
long
gasping
breaths
i
ran
when
my
shaky
knees
would
hold
me
i
ran
i
wanted
to
hide
my
hot
face
my
disgust
my
disillusion
i
wanted
to
put
my
head
in
mother
s
lap
and
cry
i
wanted
to
die
or
be
ill
so
i
need
never
see
him
again
perversely
enough
i
did
none
of
those
things
with
my
face
still
flaming
with
burning
eyes
and
hands
that
shook
i
made
a
belated
evening
toilet
and
went
slowly
haughtily
down
the
stairs
my
hands
were
like
ice
but
i
was
consumed
with
rage
oh
i
would
show
him
that
this
was
new
york
not
iquique
that
the
roof
was
not
his
andean
tableland
every
one
elaborately
ignored
my
absence
from
dinner
the
dallas
browns
max
and
lollie
were
at
bridge
jim
was
alone
in
the
den
walking
the
floor
and
biting
at
an
unlighted
cigar
betty
had
returned
to
aunt
selina
and
was
hysterical
they
said
and
flannigan
was
in
deep
dejection
because
i
had
missed
my
dinner
betty
is
making
no
end
of
a
row
max
said
looking
up
from
his
game
because
the
old
lady
upstairs
insists
on
chloroform
liniment
betty
says
the
smell
makes
her
and
she
can
inhale
russian
cigarettes
anne
said
enviously
and
gasolene
fumes
without
turning
a
hair
i
call
a
revoke
dal
you
trumped
spades
on
the
second
dal
flung
over
three
tricks
with
very
bad
grace
and
anne
counted
them
with
maddening
deliberation
game
and
rubber
she
said
watch
dal
max
he
will
cheat
in
the
score
if
he
can
kit
don
t
have
another
clam
while
i
am
in
this
house
i
have
eaten
so
many
lately
my
waist
rises
and
falls
with
the
you
have
a
stunning
color
kit
lollie
said
you
are
really
quite
superb
who
made
that
gown
where
have
you
been
hiding
du
kleine
max
whispered
under
cover
of
showing
me
the
evening
paper
with
a
photograph
of
the
house
and
a
cross
at
the
cellar
window
where
we
had
tried
to
escape
if
one
day
in
the
house
with
you
kit
puts
me
in
this
condition
what
will
a
month
do
from
beyond
the
curtain
of
a
sort
of
alcove
lighted
with
a
lamp
came
a
hum
of
conversation
bella
s
cool
even
tones
and
a
heavy
masculine
voice
they
were
laughing
i
could
feel
my
chin
go
up
he
was
not
even
hiding
his
shame
max
i
asked
while
the
others
clamored
for
him
and
the
game
has
any
one
been
up
through
the
house
since
dinner
any
of
the
men
he
looked
at
me
curiously
only
harbison
he
replied
promptly
jim
has
been
eating
his
heart
out
in
the
den
every
since
dinner
dal
played
the
sonata
appasionata
backward
on
the
pianola
he
wanted
to
put
through
one
of
anne
s
lingerie
waists
on
a
wager
that
it
would
play
a
tune
i
played
craps
with
lollie
and
flannigan
has
been
washing
dishes
why
well
that
was
conclusive
anyhow
i
had
had
a
faint
hope
that
it
might
have
been
a
joke
although
it
had
borne
all
the
evidences
of
sincerity
certainly
but
it
was
past
doubting
now
he
had
lain
in
wait
for
me
at
the
landing
and
had
kissed
me
me
when
he
thought
i
was
jimmy
s
wife
oh
i
must
have
been
very
light
very
contemptible
if
that
was
what
he
thought
of
me
i
went
into
the
library
and
got
a
book
but
it
was
impossible
to
read
with
jimmy
lying
on
the
couch
giving
vent
to
something
between
a
sigh
and
a
groan
every
few
minutes
about
eleven
the
cards
stopped
and
bella
said
she
would
read
palms
she
began
with
harbison
because
she
declared
he
had
a
wonderful
hand
full
of
possibilities
she
said
he
should
have
been
a
great
inventor
or
a
playwright
and
that
his
attitude
to
women
was
one
of
homage
respect
almost
reverence
he
had
the
courage
to
look
at
me
and
if
a
glance
could
have
killed
he
would
have
withered
away
when
jimmy
proffered
his
hand
she
looked
at
it
icily
of
course
she
could
not
refuse
with
harbison
looking
on
rather
negative
she
said
coldly
the
lines
are
obscured
by
cushions
of
flesh
no
heart
line
at
all
mentality
small
and
irritability
very
jim
held
his
palm
up
to
the
light
and
stared
at
it
gad
he
said
hardly
safe
for
me
to
go
around
without
gloves
is
it
it
was
all
well
enough
for
jim
to
laugh
but
he
was
horribly
hurt
he
stood
around
for
a
few
minutes
talking
to
anne
but
as
soon
as
he
could
he
slid
away
and
went
to
bed
he
looked
very
badly
the
next
morning
as
though
he
had
not
slept
and
his
clothes
quite
hung
on
him
he
was
actually
thinner
but
that
is
ahead
of
the
story
max
came
to
me
while
the
others
were
sitting
around
drinking
nightcaps
and
asked
me
in
a
low
tone
if
he
could
see
me
in
the
den
he
wanted
to
ask
me
something
dal
overheard
ask
her
here
he
said
we
all
know
what
it
is
max
go
ahead
and
we
ll
coach
will
you
coach
me
i
asked
for
harbison
was
listening
the
woman
does
not
need
it
dal
retorted
and
then
because
max
looked
angry
enough
really
to
propose
to
me
right
there
i
got
up
hastily
and
went
into
the
den
max
followed
and
closing
the
door
stood
with
his
back
against
it
contrary
to
the
general
belief
kit
he
began
i
did
not
intend
to
ask
you
to
marry
i
breathed
easier
he
took
a
couple
of
steps
toward
me
and
stood
with
his
arms
folded
looking
down
at
me
i
m
not
at
all
sure
in
fact
that
i
shall
ever
propose
to
you
he
went
on
unpleasantly
you
have
already
done
it
twice
you
are
not
going
to
take
those
back
are
you
max
i
asked
looking
up
at
him
but
max
was
not
to
be
cajoled
he
came
close
and
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
back
of
my
chair
what
happened
on
the
roof
tonight
he
demanded
hoarsely
i
do
not
think
it
would
interest
you
i
retorted
coloring
in
spite
of
myself
not
interest
me
i
am
shut
in
this
blasted
house
i
have
to
see
the
only
woman
i
ever
loved
really
loved
he
supplemented
as
he
caught
my
eye
pretend
she
is
another
man
s
wife
then
i
sit
back
and
watch
her
using
every
art
all
her
beauty
to
make
still
another
man
love
her
a
man
who
thinks
she
is
a
married
woman
if
harbison
were
worth
the
trouble
i
would
tell
him
the
whole
story
aunt
selina
be
obliterated
i
sat
up
suddenly
if
harbison
were
worth
the
trouble
i
repeated
what
did
he
mean
had
he
seen
i
mean
just
this
max
said
slowly
there
is
only
one
unaccredited
member
of
this
household
only
one
person
save
flannigan
who
was
locked
in
the
furnace
room
one
person
who
was
awake
and
around
the
house
when
anne
s
jewels
went
only
one
person
in
the
house
also
who
would
have
any
motive
for
the
motive
i
asked
dully
poverty
max
threw
at
me
oh
i
mean
comparative
poverty
of
course
who
is
this
fellow
anyhow
dal
knew
him
at
school
traveled
with
him
through
india
on
the
strength
of
that
he
brings
him
here
quarters
him
with
decent
people
and
wonders
when
they
are
systematically
robbed
you
are
unjust
i
said
rising
and
facing
him
i
do
not
like
harbison
i
i
hate
him
if
you
want
to
know
but
as
to
his
being
a
thief
i
think
it
is
quite
as
likely
that
you
took
the
max
threw
his
cigarette
into
the
fire
angrily
so
that
is
how
it
is
he
mocked
if
either
of
us
is
the
thief
it
is
i
you
do
hate
him
don
t
you
i
left
him
there
flushed
with
irritation
and
joined
the
others
just
as
i
entered
the
room
betty
burst
through
the
hall
door
like
a
cyclone
and
collapsed
into
a
chair
she
s
a
mean
cantankerous
old
woman
she
declared
feeling
for
her
handkerchief
you
can
take
care
of
your
own
aunt
selina
jim
wilson
i
will
never
go
near
her
what
did
you
do
poison
her
dallas
asked
with
interest
g
got
camphor
in
her
eyes
snuffed
betty
you
never
heard
such
a
noise
i
wouldn
t
be
a
trained
nurse
for
anything
in
the
world
she
she
called
me
a
hussy
you
re
not
going
to
give
her
up
are
you
betty
jim
asked
imploringly
but
betty
was
and
said
so
plainly
anyhow
she
won
t
have
me
back
she
finished
and
she
has
sent
for
guess
have
mercy
dal
cried
dropping
to
his
knees
oh
fair
ministering
angel
she
has
not
sent
for
me
no
betty
said
maliciously
she
wants
bella
she
s
crazy
about
chapter
xi
i
make
a
discovery
really
i
have
left
aunt
selina
rather
out
of
it
but
she
was
important
as
a
cause
not
as
a
result
at
least
at
first
she
came
out
strong
later
i
believe
she
was
a
very
nice
old
woman
with
strong
likes
and
prejudices
which
she
was
perfectly
willing
to
pay
for
at
least
i
only
presume
she
had
likes
i
know
she
had
prejudices
nobody
every
understood
why
bella
consented
to
take
betty
s
place
with
aunt
selina
as
for
me
i
was
too
much
engrossed
with
my
own
affairs
to
pay
the
invalid
much
attention
once
or
twice
during
the
day
i
had
stopped
in
to
see
her
and
had
been
received
frigidly
and
with
marked
disapproval
i
was
in
disgrace
of
course
after
the
scene
in
the
dining
room
the
night
before
i
had
stood
like
a
naughty
child
just
inside
the
door
and
replied
meekly
when
she
said
the
pillows
were
overstuffed
and
why
didn
t
i
have
the
linen
slips
rinsed
in
starch
water
she
laid
the
blame
of
her
illness
on
me
as
i
have
said
before
and
she
made
jim
read
to
her
in
the
afternoon
from
a
book
she
carried
with
her
coals
of
fire
on
the
domestic
hearth
marking
places
for
me
to
read
she
sent
for
me
that
night
just
as
i
had
taken
off
my
gown
so
i
threw
on
a
dressing
gown
and
went
in
to
my
horror
jim
was
already
there
at
a
gesture
from
aunt
selina
he
closed
the
door
into
the
hall
and
tiptoed
back
beside
the
bed
where
he
sat
staring
at
the
figures
on
the
silk
comfort
aunt
selina
s
first
words
were
where
s
that
jim
looked
at
me
she
must
mean
betty
i
explained
she
has
gone
to
bed
i
don
t
let
her
in
this
room
again
she
said
with
awful
emphasis
she
is
an
infamous
oh
come
now
aunt
selina
jim
broke
in
she
s
foolish
perhaps
but
she
s
a
nice
little
aunt
selina
s
face
was
a
curious
study
then
she
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
and
taking
a
flat
bag
from
under
her
pillow
held
it
out
my
cameo
breastpin
she
said
solemnly
my
with
gold
rims
and
storks
painted
on
china
in
the
middle
my
watch
that
has
put
me
to
bed
and
got
me
up
for
forty
years
and
my
money
five
hundred
and
ten
dollars
and
forty
cents
taken
with
the
doors
locked
under
my
which
was
ambiguous
but
forcible
but
good
gracious
miss
car
aunt
selina
i
exclaimed
you
don
t
think
betty
mercer
took
those
things
no
she
said
grimly
i
think
i
probably
got
up
in
my
sleep
and
lighted
the
fire
with
them
or
sent
em
out
for
a
then
she
stuffed
the
bag
away
and
sat
up
resolutely
in
bed
have
you
made
up
she
demanded
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
bella
don
t
tell
me
you
still
persist
in
that
what
nonsense
i
asked
getting
ready
to
run
that
you
do
not
love
him
james
she
snapped
irritably
do
you
suppose
i
mean
the
policeman
i
looked
over
at
jimmy
she
had
got
me
by
the
hand
and
jimmy
was
making
frantic
gestures
to
tell
her
the
whole
thing
and
be
done
with
it
but
i
had
gone
too
far
the
mill
of
the
gods
had
crushed
me
already
and
i
didn
t
propose
to
be
drawn
out
hideously
mangled
and
held
up
as
an
example
for
the
next
two
or
three
weeks
although
it
was
clear
enough
that
aunt
selina
disapproved
of
me
thoroughly
and
would
have
been
glad
enough
to
find
that
no
tie
save
the
board
of
health
held
us
together
and
then
bella
came
in
and
you
wouldn
t
have
known
her
she
had
put
on
a
straight
white
woolen
wrapper
and
she
had
her
hair
in
two
long
braids
down
her
back
she
looked
like
a
nice
little
girl
in
her
teens
and
she
had
some
lobster
salad
and
a
glass
of
port
on
a
tray
when
she
saw
the
situation
she
put
the
things
down
and
had
the
nastiness
to
stay
and
listen
i
m
not
blind
aunt
selina
said
with
one
eye
on
the
tray
you
two
silly
children
adore
each
other
i
saw
some
things
last
bella
took
a
step
forward
then
she
stopped
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
jim
was
purple
i
saw
you
kiss
her
in
the
dining
room
remember
that
aunt
selina
went
on
giving
the
screw
another
turn
it
was
bella
s
turn
to
be
excited
she
gave
me
one
awful
stare
then
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
jim
besides
aunt
selina
went
on
you
told
me
today
that
you
loved
her
don
t
deny
it
bella
couldn
t
keep
quiet
another
instant
she
came
over
and
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
please
don
t
excite
yourself
dear
miss
caruthers
she
said
in
a
voice
like
ice
every
one
knows
that
he
loves
her
he
simply
overflows
with
it
it
it
is
quite
a
among
their
friends
they
have
been
sitting
together
in
a
corner
all
yes
that
was
what
she
said
when
i
had
not
spoken
to
jimmy
the
whole
time
in
the
den
bella
was
cattish
and
she
was
jealous
too
i
turned
on
my
heel
and
went
to
the
door
then
i
turned
to
her
with
my
hand
on
the
knob
you
have
been
misinformed
i
said
coldly
you
can
not
possibly
know
having
spent
three
hours
in
a
corner
yourself
with
i
abhor
jealousy
in
a
woman
well
aunt
selina
ate
all
the
lobster
salad
and
drank
the
port
after
bella
had
told
her
it
was
beef
iron
and
wine
and
she
slept
all
night
and
was
able
to
sit
up
in
a
chair
the
next
day
and
was
so
infatuated
with
bella
that
she
would
not
let
her
out
of
her
sight
but
that
is
ahead
of
the
story
at
midnight
the
house
was
fairly
quiet
except
for
jim
who
kept
walking
around
the
halls
because
he
couldn
t
sleep
i
got
up
at
last
and
ordered
him
to
bed
and
he
had
the
audacity
to
have
a
grievance
with
me
look
at
my
situation
now
he
said
sitting
pensively
on
a
steam
radiator
aunt
selina
is
crazy
i
only
kissed
your
hand
anyhow
and
i
don
t
know
why
you
sat
in
the
den
all
evening
you
might
have
known
that
bella
would
notice
it
why
couldn
t
you
leave
me
alone
to
my
misery
very
well
i
said
much
offended
after
this
i
shall
sit
with
flannigan
in
the
kitchen
he
is
the
only
gentleman
in
the
i
left
him
babbling
apologies
and
went
to
bed
but
i
had
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
bella
had
been
a
witness
to
our
conversation
for
the
door
into
aunt
selina
s
room
closed
softly
as
i
passed
i
knew
beforehand
that
i
was
not
going
to
sleep
the
instant
i
turned
out
the
light
the
nightmare
events
of
the
evening
ranged
themselves
in
a
procession
or
a
series
of
tableaus
one
after
the
other
flannigan
on
the
roof
with
the
bracelet
on
his
palm
looking
accusingly
at
me
harbison
and
the
scene
on
the
roof
with
my
flippancy
and
the
result
of
that
flippancy
the
man
on
the
stairs
the
arms
that
held
me
the
terrible
kisses
that
had
scorched
my
lips
it
was
awful
and
then
the
absurd
situation
across
aunt
selina
s
bed
and
bella
s
face
oh
it
was
all
so
ridiculous
my
having
thought
that
the
harbison
man
was
a
gentleman
and
finding
him
a
cad
and
worse
it
was
excruciatingly
funny
i
quite
got
a
headache
from
laughing
indeed
i
laughed
until
i
found
i
was
crying
and
then
i
knew
i
was
going
to
have
an
attack
of
strangulated
emotion
called
hysteria
so
i
got
up
and
turned
on
all
the
lights
and
bathed
my
face
with
cologne
and
felt
better
but
i
did
not
go
to
sleep
when
the
hall
clock
chimed
two
i
discovered
i
was
hungry
i
had
had
nothing
since
luncheon
and
even
the
thirst
following
the
south
american
goulash
was
gone
there
was
probably
something
to
eat
in
the
pantry
and
if
there
was
not
i
was
quite
equal
to
going
to
the
basement
as
it
happened
however
i
found
a
very
orderly
assortment
of
and
a
pitcher
of
milk
which
had
no
business
there
in
the
pantry
and
with
plenty
of
light
i
was
not
at
all
frightened
i
ate
bread
and
butter
and
drank
milk
and
was
fast
becoming
a
rational
person
again
i
had
pulled
out
one
of
the
drawers
part
way
and
with
a
tray
across
the
corner
i
had
improvised
a
comfortable
seat
and
then
i
noticed
that
the
drawer
was
full
of
soiled
napkins
and
i
remembered
the
bracelet
i
hardly
know
why
i
decided
to
go
through
the
drawer
again
after
flannigan
had
already
done
it
but
i
did
i
finished
my
milk
and
then
getting
down
on
my
knees
i
proceeded
systematically
to
empty
the
drawer
i
took
out
perhaps
a
dozen
napkins
and
as
many
doilies
without
finding
anything
then
i
took
out
a
large
tray
cloth
and
there
was
something
on
it
that
made
me
look
farther
one
corner
of
it
had
been
scorched
the
clear
and
well
defined
imprint
of
a
lighted
cigarette
or
cigar
a
blackened
streak
that
trailed
off
into
a
brown
and
yellow
i
had
a
queer
trembly
feeling
as
if
i
were
on
the
brink
of
a
discovery
perhaps
anne
s
pearls
or
the
cuff
buttons
with
storks
painted
on
china
in
the
center
but
the
only
thing
i
found
down
in
the
corner
of
the
drawer
was
a
cigarette
to
me
it
seemed
quite
enough
it
was
one
of
the
south
american
cigarettes
with
a
tobacco
wrapper
instead
of
paper
that
harbison
smoked
chapter
xii
the
roof
garden
i
was
quite
ill
the
next
morning
from
excitement
i
suppose
anyhow
i
did
not
get
up
and
there
wasn
t
any
breakfast
jim
said
he
roused
flannigan
at
eight
o
clock
to
go
down
and
get
the
fire
started
and
then
went
back
to
bed
but
flannigan
did
not
get
up
he
appeared
sheepishly
at
ten
and
by
that
time
bella
was
down
in
a
towering
rage
and
had
burned
her
hand
and
got
the
fire
started
and
had
taken
up
a
tray
for
aunt
selina
and
herself
as
the
others
straggled
down
they
boiled
themselves
eggs
or
ate
fruit
and
nobody
put
anything
away
lollie
mercer
made
me
some
tea
and
scorched
toast
and
brought
it
about
eleven
o
clock
i
never
saw
such
a
house
she
declared
a
dozen
housemaids
couldn
t
put
it
in
order
why
should
every
man
that
smokes
drop
ashes
wherever
he
happens
to
be
that
s
the
question
of
the
ages
i
replied
languidly
what
was
max
talking
so
horribly
about
a
little
while
ago
lollie
looked
up
aggrieved
about
nothing
at
all
she
declared
anne
told
me
to
clean
the
bath
tubs
with
oil
and
i
did
it
that
s
all
now
max
says
he
couldn
t
get
it
off
and
his
clothes
stick
to
him
and
if
he
should
forget
and
strike
a
match
in
the
in
the
usual
way
he
would
explode
he
can
clean
his
own
tub
tomorrow
she
finished
vindictively
at
noon
jim
came
in
to
see
me
bringing
anne
as
a
concession
to
bella
he
was
in
a
rage
and
he
carried
the
morning
paper
like
a
club
in
his
hand
what
sort
of
a
newspaper
lie
would
you
call
this
he
demanded
irritably
it
makes
me
crazy
everybody
with
a
mental
image
of
me
leaning
over
the
parapet
of
the
roof
waving
a
board
with
the
rest
of
you
sitting
on
my
legs
to
keep
me
from
overbalancing
maybe
there
s
a
picture
anne
said
hopefully
jim
looked
no
picture
he
announced
i
wonder
why
they
restrained
themselves
i
wish
bella
would
keep
off
the
roof
he
added
with
fresh
access
of
rage
or
wear
a
mask
or
veil
one
of
those
fellows
is
going
to
recognize
her
and
there
ll
be
the
deuce
to
when
you
are
all
through
discussing
this
thing
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
i
remarked
from
my
couch
why
did
you
lean
over
the
parapet
jim
and
who
sat
on
your
legs
i
didn
t
nobody
did
he
retorted
waving
the
newspaper
it
s
a
lie
out
of
the
whole
cloth
that
s
what
it
is
i
asked
you
girls
to
be
decent
to
those
reporters
it
never
pays
to
offend
a
newspaper
man
listen
to
this
he
read
the
article
rapidly
furiously
pausing
every
now
and
then
to
make
an
exasperated
comment

this

mccloud
s
story
told
to
a
chronicle
reporter
this
morning
is
as
follows
the
occupants
of
the
house
had
been
uneasy
all
day
from
the
air
of
subdued
bustle
and
from
a
careful
inspection
of
the
roof
made
by
the
entire
party
during
the
afternoon
his
suspicion
had
been
aroused
nothing
unusual
however
occurred
during
the
early
part
of
the
night
from
eight
o
clock
to
twelve
mccloud
was
relieved
from
duty
his
place
being
taken
by
michael
shane
of
the
street
station
when
mccloud
came
on
duty
at
midnight
shane
reported
that
about
eleven
o
clock
the
searchlight
of
a
steamer
on
the
river
flashing
over
the
house
had
shown
a
man
crouching
on
the
parapet
evidently
surveying
the
roof
across
which
at
this
point
is
only
twelve
feet
distant
with
a
view
of
making
his
escape
one
seeing
shane
below
however
he
had
beat
a
retreat
but
not
before
the
officer
had
seen
him
distinctly
he
was
dressed
in
evening
clothes
and
wore
a
light
tan
overcoat
officer
mccloud
relieved
shane
at
midnight
and
sent
for
a
man
from
the
station
house
this
man
was
stationed
on
the
roof
of
the
bevington
residence
next
door
with
strict
injunctions
to
prevent
an
escape
from
the
quarantined
mansion
nothing
suspicious
having
occurred
the
man
on
the
roof
left
about
reporting
to
mccloud
below
that
everything
was
quiet
at
that
moment
glancing
skyward
one
of
the
officers
was
astounded
to
see
a
long
narrow
board
project
itself
from
the
coping
of
the
wildon
house
waver
uncertainly
for
a
moment
and
then
advance
stealthily
toward
the
parapet
across
when
it
was
within
a
foot
or
two
of
a
resting
place
mccloud
called
sharply
to
the
invisible
refugee
above
at
the
same
time
firing
his
revolver
in
the
ground
the
result
was
surprising
the
board
stopped
trembled
swayed
a
little
and
dropped
missing
the
vigilant
officers
by
a
hair
s
breadth
and
crashing
to
the
cement
with
a
terrific
force
an
inspection
of
the
roof
from
the
bevington
house
later
revealed
nothing
unusual
it
is
evident
however
that
the
quarantine
is
proving
irksome
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
sequestered
residence
most
of
whom
are
typical
society
folk
without
resources
in
themselves
their
condition
without
valets
and
maids
is
certainly
pitiable
it
has
been
rumored
that
the
ladies
are
doing
their
own
hair
and
that
the
gentlemen
have
been
reduced
to
putting
their
own
buttons
in
their
shirts
this
deplorable
situation
however
is
unavoidable
the
vigilance
of
the
board
of
health
has
been
most
commendable
in
this
case
beginning
with
a
wager
over
the
telephone
that
they
would
break
quarantine
in
hours
and
ending
with
the
attempt
to
span
a
gulf
with
a
board
over
which
to
cross
to
freedom
these
society
folk
have
shown
characteristic
disregard
of
the
laws
of
the
state
it
is
quite
time
to
extend
to
the
millionaire
the
same
strictness
that
keeps
the
commuter
at
home
for
three
weeks
with
the
measles
that
makes
him
get
the
milk
bottles
and
groceries
from
the
gate
post
and
smell
like
dog
soap
for
a
month
afterward
as
a
result
of
we
sat
in
dead
silence
for
a
minute
then
perhaps
it
is
true
i
said
not
of
you
jim
but
some
one
may
have
tried
to
get
out
that
way
in
fact
i
think
it
extremely
who
flannigan
you
couldn
t
drive
him
out
he
s
having
the
time
of
his
life
do
you
suspect
me
come
away
and
don
t
fight
anne
broke
in
pacifically
you
will
have
to
have
luncheon
sent
in
jimmy
nobody
has
ordered
anything
from
the
shops
and
i
feel
like
old
mother
i
wish
you
would
all
go
out
i
said
wearily
if
every
man
in
the
house
says
he
didn
t
try
to
get
over
to
the
next
roof
last
night
well
and
good
but
you
might
look
and
see
if
the
board
is
still
lying
where
it
there
was
an
instantaneous
rush
for
the
window
and
a
second
s
pause
then
jimmy
s
voice
incredulous
awed
well
i
ll
be
blessed
there
s
the
board
i
stayed
in
my
room
all
that
day
my
head
really
ached
and
then
too
i
did
not
care
to
meet
harbison
it
would
have
to
come
i
realized
that
a
meeting
was
inevitable
but
i
wanted
time
to
think
how
i
would
meet
him
it
would
be
impossible
to
cut
him
without
rousing
the
curiosity
of
the
others
to
fever
pitch
and
it
was
equally
impossible
to
ignore
the
disgraceful
episode
on
the
stairs
as
it
happened
however
i
need
not
have
worried
i
went
down
to
dinner
languidly
when
every
one
was
seated
and
found
max
at
my
right
and
harbison
moved
over
beside
bella
every
one
was
talking
at
once
for
flannigan
ambling
around
the
table
as
airily
as
he
walked
his
beat
had
presented
bella
with
her
bracelet
on
a
salad
plate
garnished
with
romaine
he
had
found
it
in
the
furnace
room
he
said
where
she
must
have
dropped
it
and
he
looked
at
me
stealthily
to
approve
his
mendacity
every
one
was
famished
and
as
they
ate
they
discussed
the
board
in
the
area
way
and
pretended
to
deride
it
as
a
clever
bit
of
press
work
to
revive
a
dying
sensation
no
one
was
deceived
anne
s
pearls
and
the
attempt
to
escape
coming
just
after
pointed
only
to
one
thing
i
looked
around
the
table
dazed
flannigan
almost
the
only
unknown
quantity
might
have
tried
to
escape
the
night
before
but
he
would
not
have
been
in
dress
clothes
besides
he
must
be
eliminated
as
far
as
the
pearls
were
concerned
having
been
locked
in
the
furnace
room
the
night
they
were
stolen
there
was
no
one
among
the
girls
to
suspect
the
mercer
girls
had
stunning
pearls
and
could
secure
all
they
wanted
legitimately
and
bella
disliked
them
oh
there
was
no
question
about
it
i
decided
dallas
and
anne
had
taken
a
wolf
to
their
bosom
or
is
it
a
viper
and
the
harbison
man
was
the
creature
although
i
must
say
that
looking
over
the
table
at
jimmy
s
breadth
and
not
very
imposing
personality
at
max
s
lean
length
sallow
skin
and
bold
dark
eyes
at
dallas
blond
growing
bald
and
florid
and
then
at
the
harbison
boy
tall
muscular
and
sunburned
one
would
have
taken
max
at
first
choice
as
the
villain
with
dal
next
jim
third
and
the
harbison
boy
not
in
the
running
it
was
just
after
dinner
that
the
surprise
was
sprung
on
me
harbison
came
around
to
me
gravely
and
asked
me
if
i
felt
able
to
go
up
on
the
roof
on
the
roof
after
last
night
i
had
to
gather
myself
together
luckily
the
others
were
pushing
back
their
chairs
showing
flannigan
the
liqueur
glasses
to
take
up
and
lighting
cigars
i
do
not
care
to
go
i
said
icily
the
others
are
coming
he
persisted
and
i
i
could
give
you
an
arm
up
the
i
believe
you
are
good
at
that
i
said
looking
at
him
steadily
max
will
you
help
me
to
the
roof
harbison
really
turned
rather
white
then
he
bowed
ceremoniously
and
left
me
max
got
me
a
wrap
and
every
one
except
harbison
and
bella
who
was
taking
a
mass
of
indigestables
to
aunt
selina
went
to
the
roof
where
is
tom
anne
asked
as
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
gone
ahead
to
fix
things
was
the
answer
but
he
was
not
there
at
the
top
of
the
last
flight
i
stopped
dumb
with
amazement
the
roof
had
been
transformed
enchanted
it
was
a
of
lights
and
foliage
and
colors
i
had
to
stop
and
rub
my
eyes
from
the
bleakness
of
a
tin
roof
in
february
to
the
brightness
and
greenery
of
a
july
roof
garden
you
were
the
immediate
inspiration
kit
dallas
said
harbison
thought
your
headache
might
come
from
lack
of
exercise
and
fresh
air
and
he
has
worked
us
like
nailers
all
day
i
ve
a
blister
on
my
right
palm
and
harbison
got
shocked
while
he
was
wiring
the
place
and
nearly
fell
over
the
parapet
we
bought
out
two
florists
by
it
was
the
most
amazing
transformation
at
each
corner
a
pole
had
been
erected
and
wires
crossed
the
roof
diagonally
hung
with
red
and
amber
bulbs
around
the
chimneys
had
been
massed
evergreen
trees
in
tubs
hiding
their
ugliness
and
among
the
trees
tiny
lights
were
strung
along
the
parapet
were
rows
of
geometrical
boxwood
plants
in
bright
red
crocks
and
the
flaps
of
a
crimson
and
white
tent
had
been
thrown
open
showing
lights
within
and
rugs
wicker
chairs
and
cushions
max
raised
a
glass
of
benedictine
and
posed
for
a
moment
melodramatically
to
the
wilson
roof
garden
he
said
to
kit
who
inspired
to
the
creators
who
perspired
and
to
takahiro
may
he
not
have
every
one
was
very
gay
i
think
the
knowledge
that
tomorrow
aunt
selina
might
be
with
them
urged
them
to
make
the
most
of
this
last
night
of
freedom
i
tried
to
be
jolly
and
succeeded
in
being
feverish
harbison
did
not
come
up
to
enjoy
what
he
had
wrought
jim
brought
up
his
guitar
and
sang
love
songs
in
a
beautiful
tenor
looking
at
bella
all
the
time
and
bella
sat
in
a
steamer
chair
with
a
rug
over
her
and
a
spangled
veil
on
her
head
looking
at
the
boats
on
the
river
about
as
soft
and
as
chastened
as
an
an
acetylene
headlight
and
after
max
had
told
the
most
improbable
tale
which
leila
advised
him
to
sprinkle
salt
on
and
dallas
had
done
a
clog
dance
bella
said
it
was
time
for
her
complexion
sleep
and
went
downstairs
and
broke
up
the
party
if
she
only
give
half
as
an
much
care
to
her
immortal
soul
anne
said
when
she
had
gone
as
she
does
to
her
skin
she
would
let
that
nice
harbison
boy
alone
she
must
have
been
brutal
to
him
tonight
for
he
went
to
bed
at
nine
o
clock
at
least
i
suppose
he
went
to
bed
for
he
shut
himself
in
the
studio
and
when
i
knocked
he
advised
me
not
to
come
i
had
pleaded
my
headache
as
an
excuse
for
avoiding
aunt
selina
all
day
and
she
had
not
sent
for
me
bella
was
really
quite
extraordinary
she
was
never
in
the
habit
of
putting
herself
out
for
any
one
and
she
always
declared
that
the
very
odor
of
a
sick
room
drove
her
to
scotch
and
soda
but
here
she
was
rubbing
aunt
selina
s
back
with
chloroform
liniment
and
you
know
how
that
smells
getting
her
up
in
a
chair
dressed
in
one
of
bella
s
wadded
silk
robes
with
pillows
under
her
feet
and
then
doing
her
hair
in
elaborate
puffs
braiding
her
gray
switch
and
bringing
it
around
the
top
of
her
head
she
even
put
rice
powder
on
aunt
selina
s
nose
and
dabbed
violet
water
behind
her
ears
and
said
she
couldn
t
understand
why
she
aunt
selina
had
never
married
but
of
course
she
probably
would
some
day
the
result
was
naturally
that
the
old
lady
wouldn
t
let
bella
out
of
her
sight
except
to
go
to
the
kitchen
for
something
to
eat
for
her
that
very
day
bella
got
the
doctor
to
order
ale
for
aunt
selina
oh
yes
the
doctor
could
come
in
dal
said
it
was
all
in
and
nothing
going
out
and
she
had
three
pints
of
bass
and
learned
to
eat
anchovies
and
caviare
all
in
one
day
bella
s
conduct
to
jim
was
disgraceful
she
snubbed
him
ignored
him
tramped
on
him
and
jim
was
growing
positively
flabby
he
spent
most
of
his
time
writing
letters
to
the
board
of
health
and
playing
solitaire
he
was
a
pathetic
figure
well
we
went
to
bed
fairly
early
bella
had
massaged
aunt
selina
s
face
and
rubbed
in
cold
cream
anne
and
dallas
had
compromised
on
which
window
should
be
open
in
their
bedroom
and
the
men
had
matched
to
see
who
should
look
at
the
furnace
i
did
not
expect
to
sleep
but
the
cold
night
air
had
done
its
work
and
i
was
asleep
almost
immediately
some
time
during
the
early
part
of
the
night
i
wakened
and
after
turning
and
twisting
uneasily
i
realized
that
i
was
cold
the
couch
in
bella
s
dressing
room
was
comfortable
enough
but
narrow
and
low
i
remember
distinctly
that
was
what
was
so
maddening
everybody
thought
i
dreamed
it
i
remember
getting
an
eiderdown
comfort
that
was
folded
at
my
feet
and
pulling
it
up
around
me
in
the
luxury
of
its
warmth
i
snuggled
down
and
went
to
sleep
almost
instantly
it
seemed
to
me
i
had
slept
for
hours
but
it
was
probably
an
hour
or
less
when
something
roused
me
the
room
was
perfectly
dark
and
there
was
not
a
sound
save
the
faint
ticking
of
the
clock
but
i
was
wide
awake
and
then
came
the
incident
that
in
its
ghastly
horrible
absurdity
made
the
rest
of
the
people
shout
with
laughter
the
next
day
it
was
not
funny
then
for
suddenly
the
eiderdown
comfort
began
to
slip
i
heard
no
footstep
not
the
slightest
sound
approaching
me
but
the
comfort
moved
from
my
chin
inch
by
inch
it
slipped
to
my
shoulders
awfully
inevitably
it
moved
i
could
feel
my
blood
gather
around
my
heart
leaving
me
cold
and
nerveless
as
it
passed
my
hands
i
gave
an
involuntary
clutch
for
it
to
feel
it
slip
away
from
my
fingers
then
the
full
horror
of
the
situation
took
hold
of
me
as
the
comfort
slid
past
my
feet
i
sat
up
and
screamed
at
the
top
of
my
voice
of
course
people
came
running
in
all
sorts
of
things
i
was
still
sitting
up
declaring
i
had
seen
a
ghost
and
that
the
house
was
haunted
dallas
was
struggling
for
the
second
armhole
of
his
dressing
gown
and
bella
had
already
turned
on
the
lights
they
said
i
had
had
a
nightmare
and
not
to
sleep
on
my
back
and
perhaps
i
was
taking
grippe
and
just
then
we
heard
jimmy
run
down
the
stairs
and
fall
over
something
almost
breaking
his
wrist
it
was
the
eiderdown
comfort
up
the
studio
staircase
chapter
xiii
he
does
not
deny
it
aunt
selina
got
up
the
next
morning
and
jim
told
her
all
the
strange
things
that
had
been
happening
she
fixed
on
flannigan
of
course
although
she
still
suspected
betty
of
her
watch
and
other
valuables
the
incident
of
the
comfort
she
called
nervous
indigestion
and
bad
hours
she
spent
the
entire
day
going
through
the
storeroom
and
linen
closets
and
running
her
fingers
over
things
for
dust
whenever
she
found
any
she
looked
at
me
drew
a
long
breath
and
said
poor
james
it
was
maddening
and
when
she
went
through
his
clothes
and
found
some
buttons
off
jim
didn
t
keep
a
man
and
takahiro
had
stopped
at
his
boots
she
looked
at
me
quite
awfully
his
mother
was
a
perfect
housekeeper
she
said
james
was
brought
up
in
clothes
with
the
buttons
on
put
on
clean
didn
t
they
put
them
on
him
i
asked
almost
hysterically
it
had
been
a
bad
morning
after
a
worse
night
every
one
had
found
fault
with
the
breakfast
and
they
straggled
down
one
at
a
time
until
i
was
frantic
then
flannigan
had
talked
to
me
about
the
pearls
and
harbison
had
said
good
morning
very
stiffly
and
nearly
rattled
the
inside
of
the
furnace
out
early
in
the
morning
too
i
overheard
a
scrap
of
conversation
between
the
policeman
and
our
gentleman
adventurer
from
south
america
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
telephone
and
harbison
was
fussing
over
it
with
a
screw
driver
and
a
pair
of
scissors
all
the
tools
he
could
find
flannigan
was
lifting
rugs
to
shake
them
on
the
roof
bella
s
order
wash
the
table
linen
he
was
grumbling
i
ll
do
what
i
can
that
s
necessary
grub
has
to
be
cooked
and
dishes
has
to
be
washed
i
ll
admit
that
if
you
re
particular
make
up
your
bed
every
day
i
don
t
object
but
don
t
tell
me
we
have
to
use
table
napkins
a
day
what
did
folks
do
before
napkins
was
invented
tell
me
that
triumphantly
what
s
the
answer
harbison
inquired
absently
evidently
with
the
screw
driver
in
his
mouth
used
their
pocket
handkerchiefs
and
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
harbison
these
folks
here
can
use
their
sleeves
for
all
i
care
not
that
the
women
has
any
sleeves
to
speak
of
wash
clothes
i
will
well
don
t
worry
wilson
about
it
the
other
voice
said
flannigan
straightened
himself
with
a
grunt
mrs
wilson
he
said
a
lot
she
would
worry
she
s
been
a
disappointment
to
me
harbison
me
thinking
that
now
she
d
come
back
to
him
after
leavin
him
the
way
she
did
they
d
be
like
two
turtle
doves
lord
the
cook
next
door
but
what
the
cook
had
told
about
bella
and
jimmy
was
not
divulged
for
the
harbison
man
caught
him
up
with
a
jerk
and
sent
flannigan
grumbling
with
his
rugs
to
the
roof
it
did
not
seem
possible
to
carry
on
the
deception
much
longer
but
if
things
were
bad
now
what
would
they
be
when
aunt
selina
learned
she
had
been
lied
to
made
ridiculous
generally
deceived
and
how
would
i
be
able
to
live
in
the
house
with
her
when
she
did
know
luckily
every
one
was
so
puzzled
over
the
mystery
in
the
house
that
numbers
of
little
things
that
would
have
been
absolutely
damning
were
never
noticed
at
all
for
instance
my
asking
jimmy
at
luncheon
that
day
if
he
took
cream
in
his
coffee
and
max
coming
to
the
rescue
by
dropping
his
watch
in
his
glass
of
water
and
creating
a
diversion
and
giving
everybody
an
opportunity
to
laugh
by
saying
not
to
mind
it
had
been
in
soak
before
just
after
luncheon
aunt
selina
brought
me
some
undergarments
of
jim
s
to
be
patched
she
explained
at
length
that
he
had
always
worn
out
his
undergarments
because
he
always
squirmed
around
so
when
he
was
sitting
and
she
showed
me
how
to
lay
one
of
the
garments
over
a
pillow
to
get
the
patch
in
properly
it
was
the
most
humiliating
moment
of
my
life
but
there
was
no
escape
i
took
my
sewing
to
the
roof
while
she
went
away
to
find
something
else
for
me
to
do
when
that
was
finished
and
i
sat
with
the
thing
on
my
knee
and
stared
at
it
while
rebellious
tears
rolled
down
my
cheeks
the
patch
was
not
the
shape
of
the
hole
at
all
and
every
time
i
took
a
stitch
i
sewed
it
fast
to
the
pillow
beneath
it
was
terrible
jim
came
up
after
a
while
and
sat
down
across
from
me
and
watched
without
saying
anything
i
suppose
what
he
felt
would
not
have
been
proper
to
say
to
me
we
had
both
reached
the
point
where
adequate
language
failed
us
finally
he
said
i
wish
i
were
so
do
i
i
retorted
jerking
the
thread
where
is
she
now
looking
for
more
of
i
indicated
the
garment
over
the
pillow
and
he
wiggled
please
don
t
squirm
i
said
coldly
you
will
wear
out
your
lingerie
and
i
will
have
to
mend
he
sat
very
still
for
five
minutes
when
i
discovered
that
i
had
put
the
patch
in
crosswise
instead
of
lengthwise
and
that
it
would
not
fit
as
i
jerked
it
out
he
sneezed
or
sneeze
i
added
venomously
you
will
tear
your
buttons
off
and
i
will
have
to
sew
them
jim
rose
wrathfully
don
t
sit
don
t
sneeze
he
repeated
don
t
stand
i
suppose
for
fear
i
will
wear
out
my
socks
here
give
me
that
if
the
fool
thing
has
to
be
mended
i
ll
do
it
he
went
over
to
a
corner
of
the
parapet
and
turned
his
back
to
me
he
was
very
much
offended
in
about
a
minute
he
came
back
triumphant
and
held
out
the
result
of
his
labor
i
could
only
gasp
he
had
puckered
up
the
edges
of
the
hole
like
the
neck
of
a
bag
and
had
tied
the
thread
around
it
you
you
won
t
be
able
to
sit
down
i
ventured
don
t
have
any
time
to
sit
he
retorted
promptly
anyhow
it
will
give
some
won
t
it
it
would
if
it
was
tied
with
elastic
instead
of
thread
have
you
any
elastic
lollie
came
up
just
then
and
jim
took
himself
and
his
mending
downstairs
luckily
aunt
selina
found
several
letters
in
his
room
that
afternoon
while
she
was
going
over
his
clothes
and
as
it
took
jim
some
time
to
explain
them
she
forgot
the
task
she
had
given
me
altogether
when
lollie
came
up
to
the
roof
she
closed
the
door
to
the
stairs
and
coming
over
drew
a
chair
close
to
mine
have
you
seen
much
of
tom
today
she
asked
as
an
introduction
i
suppose
you
mean
harbison
lollie
i
said
no
not
any
more
than
i
could
help
don
t
whisper
he
couldn
t
possibly
hear
you
and
if
it
s
scandal
i
don
t
want
to
know
look
here
kit
she
retorted
you
needn
t
be
so
superior
if
i
like
to
talk
scandal
i
m
not
so
sure
you
aren
t
making
that
was
the
way
right
along
i
was
making
scandal
i
brought
them
there
to
dinner
i
let
bella
in
and
of
course
anne
came
up
then
and
began
on
me
at
once
you
are
a
very
bad
girl
she
began
what
do
you
mean
by
treating
tom
harbison
the
way
you
do
he
is
i
think
you
exaggerate
my
influence
over
him
i
retorted
i
haven
t
treated
him
badly
because
i
haven
t
paid
any
attention
to
anne
threw
up
her
hands
there
you
are
she
said
he
worked
all
day
yesterday
fixing
this
place
for
you
yes
for
you
my
dear
i
am
not
blind
and
last
night
you
refused
to
let
him
bring
you
he
told
you
i
flamed
he
wondered
what
he
had
done
and
as
you
wouldn
t
let
him
come
within
speaking
distance
of
you
he
came
to
i
am
sorry
anne
since
you
are
fond
of
him
i
said
but
to
me
he
is
impossible
intolerable
my
reasons
are
quite
kit
is
perfectly
right
anne
leila
broke
in
i
tell
you
there
is
something
queer
about
him
she
added
in
a
portentous
whisper
anne
stiffened
he
is
perfect
she
declared
of
good
family
courageous
handsome
clever
what
more
do
you
ask
honesty
said
leila
hotly
that
a
man
should
be
what
he
says
he
anne
and
i
both
stared
it
is
your
harbison
leila
went
on
who
tried
to
escape
from
the
house
by
putting
a
board
across
to
the
next
roof
i
don
t
believe
it
said
anne
you
might
bring
me
a
picture
of
him
board
in
hand
and
i
wouldn
t
believe
don
t
then
lollie
said
cruelly
let
him
get
away
with
your
pearls
they
are
yours
only
as
sure
as
anything
the
man
who
tried
to
escape
from
the
house
had
a
reason
for
escaping
and
the
papers
said
a
man
in
evening
dress
and
light
overcoat
i
found
harbison
s
overcoat
today
lying
in
a
heap
in
one
of
the
maids
rooms
and
it
was
covered
with
brick
dust
all
over
the
front
a
button
had
even
been
torn
pooh
anne
said
when
she
had
recovered
herself
a
little
there
isn
t
any
reason
as
far
as
that
goes
why
flannigan
shouldn
t
have
worn
tom
s
overcoat
or
any
of
the
flannigan
leila
said
loftily
why
his
arms
are
like
piano
legs
he
couldn
t
get
into
it
as
for
the
others
there
is
only
one
person
who
would
fit
or
nearly
fit
that
overcoat
and
that
is
dallas
while
anne
was
choking
down
her
wrath
leila
got
up
and
darted
out
of
the
tent
when
she
came
back
she
was
triumphant
look
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
and
on
her
palm
lay
a
lightish
brown
button
i
found
it
just
where
the
paper
said
the
board
was
thrown
out
and
it
is
from
harbison
s
overcoat
without
a
of
course
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
a
man
who
would
kiss
a
woman
on
a
dark
staircase
a
woman
he
had
known
only
two
days
was
capable
of
anything
kit
has
only
been
a
little
keener
than
the
rest
of
us
lollie
said
she
found
him
out
upon
my
word
said
anne
indignantly
preparing
to
go
if
i
didn
t
know
you
girls
so
well
i
would
think
you
were
crazy
and
now
just
to
offset
this
i
can
tell
you
something
flannigan
told
me
this
morning
not
to
worry
that
he
has
my
pearl
collar
spotted
and
that
young
ladies
will
have
their
jokes
yes
as
i
said
before
it
was
a
cheerful
situation
i
sat
and
thought
it
over
after
anne
s
parting
shot
when
leila
had
flounced
downstairs
things
were
closing
in
i
gave
the
situation
hours
to
develop
at
the
end
of
that
time
flannigan
would
accuse
me
openly
of
knowing
where
the
pearls
were
i
would
explain
my
silly
remark
to
him
and
the
mine
would
explode
under
aunt
selina
i
was
sunk
in
dejected
reverie
when
some
one
came
on
the
roof
when
he
was
opposite
the
opening
in
the
tent
i
saw
harbison
and
at
that
moment
he
saw
me
he
paused
uncertainly
then
he
made
an
evident
effort
and
came
over
to
me
you
are
better
today
quite
well
thank
i
am
glad
you
find
the
tent
useful
does
it
keep
off
the
wind
it
is
quite
a
shelter
frigidly
he
still
stood
struggling
for
something
to
say
evidently
nothing
came
to
his
mind
for
he
lifted
the
cap
he
was
wearing
and
turning
away
began
to
work
with
the
wiring
of
the
roof
he
was
clever
with
tools
one
could
see
that
if
he
was
a
professional
no
doubt
he
needed
to
be
after
a
bit
finding
it
necessary
to
climb
to
the
parapet
he
took
off
his
coat
without
even
a
glance
in
my
direction
and
fell
to
work
vigorously
one
does
not
need
to
like
a
man
to
admire
him
physically
any
more
than
one
needs
to
like
a
race
horse
or
any
other
splendid
animal
no
one
could
deny
that
the
man
on
the
parapet
was
a
splendid
animal
he
looked
quite
big
enough
and
strong
enough
to
have
tossed
his
slender
bridge
across
the
gulf
to
the
next
roof
without
any
difficulty
and
coordinate
enough
to
have
crossed
on
it
with
a
flourish
to
safety
just
then
there
was
a
rending
tearing
sound
from
the
corner
and
a
muttered
ejaculation
i
looked
up
in
time
to
see
harbison
throw
up
his
arms
make
a
futile
attempt
to
regain
his
balance
and
disappear
over
the
edge
of
the
roof
one
instant
he
was
standing
there
splendid
superb
the
next
the
corner
of
the
parapet
was
empty
all
that
stood
there
was
a
broken
splintered
post
and
a
tangle
of
wires
i
could
not
have
moved
at
first
at
least
it
seemed
hours
before
the
full
significance
of
the
thing
penetrated
my
dazed
brain
when
i
got
up
i
seemed
to
walk
to
crawl
with
leaden
weights
holding
back
my
feet
when
i
got
to
the
corner
i
had
to
catch
the
post
for
support
i
knew
somebody
was
saying
oh
how
terrible
over
and
over
it
was
only
afterward
that
i
knew
it
had
been
myself
and
then
some
other
voice
was
saying
don
t
be
alarmed
please
don
t
be
frightened
i
m
all
i
dared
to
look
over
the
parapet
finally
and
instead
of
a
crushed
and
unspeakable
body
there
was
harbison
sitting
about
eight
feet
below
me
with
his
feet
swinging
into
space
and
a
long
red
scratch
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
across
his
cheek
there
was
a
sort
of
mansard
there
with
windows
and
just
enough
coping
to
keep
him
from
rolling
off
i
thought
you
had
fallen
all
the
way
i
gasped
trying
to
keep
my
lips
from
trembling
i
oh
don
t
dangle
your
feet
like
that
he
did
not
seem
at
all
glad
of
his
escape
he
sat
there
gloomily
peering
into
the
gulf
beneath
if
it
wasn
t
so
er
messy
and
generally
unpleasant
he
replied
without
looking
up
i
would
slide
off
and
go
the
rest
of
the
you
are
childish
i
said
severely
see
if
you
can
get
through
the
window
behind
you
if
you
can
not
i
ll
come
down
and
unfasten
but
the
window
was
open
and
i
had
a
chance
to
sit
down
and
gather
up
the
scattered
ends
of
my
nerves
to
my
surprise
however
when
he
came
back
he
made
no
effort
to
renew
our
conversation
he
ignored
me
completely
and
went
to
work
at
once
to
repair
the
damage
to
his
wires
with
his
back
to
me
i
think
you
are
very
rude
i
said
at
last
you
fell
over
there
and
i
thought
you
were
killed
the
nervous
shock
i
experienced
is
just
as
bad
as
if
you
had
gone
all
the
he
put
down
the
hammer
and
came
over
to
me
without
speaking
then
when
he
was
quite
close
he
said
i
am
very
sorry
if
i
startled
you
i
did
not
flatter
myself
that
you
would
be
profoundly
affected
in
any
oh
as
to
that
i
said
lightly
it
makes
me
ill
for
days
if
my
car
runs
over
a
he
looked
at
me
in
silence
you
are
not
going
to
get
up
on
that
parapet
again
mrs
wilson
he
said
without
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
my
question
will
you
tell
me
what
i
have
done
done
or
have
not
done
i
have
racked
my
brains
stayed
awake
all
of
last
night
at
first
i
hoped
it
was
impersonal
that
womanlike
you
were
merely
venting
general
disfavor
on
one
particular
individual
but
your
hostility
is
to
me
i
raised
my
eyebrows
coldly
interrogative
perhaps
he
went
on
calmly
perhaps
i
was
a
fool
here
on
the
roof
the
night
before
last
if
i
said
anything
that
i
should
not
i
ask
your
pardon
if
it
is
not
that
i
think
you
ought
to
ask
mine
i
was
angry
enough
then
there
can
be
only
one
opinion
about
your
conduct
i
retorted
warmly
it
was
worse
than
brutal
it
it
was
unspeakable
i
have
no
words
for
it
except
that
i
loathe
it
and
he
was
very
grim
by
this
time
i
have
heard
you
say
something
like
that
before
only
i
was
not
the
unfortunate
in
that
oh
i
was
choking
under
different
circumstances
i
should
be
the
last
person
to
recall
anything
so
personal
but
the
circumstances
are
he
took
an
angry
step
toward
me
will
you
tell
me
what
i
have
done
or
shall
i
go
down
and
ask
the
others
you
wouldn
t
dare
i
cried
or
i
will
tell
them
what
you
did
how
you
waylaid
me
on
those
stairs
there
and
forced
your
caresses
your
kisses
on
me
oh
i
could
die
with
shame
the
silence
that
followed
was
as
unexpected
as
it
was
ominous
i
knew
he
was
staring
at
me
and
i
was
furious
to
find
myself
so
emotional
so
much
more
the
excited
of
the
two
finally
i
looked
up
you
can
not
deny
it
i
said
a
sort
of
he
was
very
quiet
very
grim
quite
composed
no
he
repeated
judicially
i
do
not
deny
he
did
not
or
he
would
not
which
chapter
xiv
almost
but
not
quite
dal
had
been
acting
strangely
all
day
once
early
in
the
evening
when
i
had
doubled
no
trump
he
led
me
a
club
without
apology
and
later
on
during
his
dummy
i
saw
him
writing
our
names
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
and
putting
numbers
after
them
at
my
earliest
opportunity
i
went
to
max
there
is
something
the
matter
with
dal
max
i
volunteered
he
has
been
acting
strangely
all
day
and
just
now
he
was
making
out
a
list
names
and
you
re
to
blame
for
that
kit
max
said
seriously
you
put
washing
soda
instead
of
baking
soda
in
those
biscuits
today
and
he
thinks
he
is
a
steam
laundry
those
are
laundry
lists
he
s
making
out
he
asked
me
a
little
while
ago
if
i
wanted
a
domestic
yes
i
had
put
washing
soda
in
the
biscuits
the
book
said
soda
and
how
is
one
to
know
which
is
meant
i
do
not
think
you
are
calculated
for
a
domestic
finish
i
said
coldly
as
i
turned
away
in
any
case
i
disclaim
any
such
responsibility
but
there
is
something
on
dal
s
max
came
after
me
don
t
be
cross
kit
you
haven
t
said
a
nice
word
to
me
today
and
you
go
around
bristling
with
your
chin
up
and
two
red
spots
on
your
cheeks
like
with
the
snakes
instead
of
hair
i
don
t
know
why
i
m
so
crazy
about
you
i
always
meant
to
love
a
girl
with
a
nice
i
left
him
then
dal
had
gone
into
the
reception
room
and
closed
the
doors
and
because
he
had
been
acting
so
strangely
and
partly
to
escape
from
max
whose
eyes
looked
threatening
i
followed
him
just
as
i
opened
the
door
quietly
and
looked
in
dallas
switched
off
the
lights
and
i
could
hear
him
groping
his
way
across
the
room
then
somebody
not
dal
spoke
from
the
corner
cautiously
is
that
you
brown
sir
it
was
flannigan
yes
is
everything
here
all
but
the
powder
sir

t
step

flannigan
i
want
to
see
the
the
flare
showed
dallas
and
flannigan
bent
over
the
timepiece
and
it
showed
something
else
the
rug
had
been
turned
back
from
the
windows
which
opened
on
the
street
and
the
curtains
had
been
removed
on
the
bare
hardwood
floor
just
beneath
the
windows
was
an
array
of
pans
of
various
sizes
dish
pans
cake
tins
and
a
metal
foot
tub
the
pans
were
raised
from
the
floor
on
bricks
and
seemed
to
be
full
of
paper
all
the
chairs
and
tables
were
pushed
back
against
the
wall
and
the
was
stacked
on
the
mantel
half
an
hour
yet
dal
said
closing
his
watch
plenty
of
time
and
remember
the
signal
four
short
and
two
four
short
and
two
long
all
right
and
flannigan
here
s
something
for
you
on
thank
you
dal
turned
to
go
out
tripped
over
the
rug
said
something
and
passed
me
without
an
idea
of
my
presence
a
moment
later
flannigan
went
out
and
i
was
left
huddled
against
the
wall
and
alone
it
was
puzzling
enough
four
long
and
two
short
all
but
the
powder
not
that
i
believed
for
a
moment
what
max
had
said
and
anyhow
flannigan
was
the
sanest
person
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
but
it
all
seemed
a
part
of
the
mystery
that
had
been
hanging
over
us
for
several
days
i
felt
my
way
across
the
room
and
knelt
by
the
pans
yes
they
were
there
full
of
paper
and
mounted
on
bricks
it
had
not
been
a
delusion
and
then
i
straightened
on
my
knees
suddenly
for
an
automobile
passing
under
the
windows
had
sounded
four
short
honks
and
two
long
ones
the
signal
was
followed
instantly
by
a
crash
the
foot
bath
had
fallen
from
its
supports
and
lay
quivering
and
vibrating
with
horrid
noises
at
my
feet
the
next
moment
harbison
had
thrown
open
the
door
and
leaped
into
the
room
who
s
there
he
demanded
against
the
light
i
could
see
him
reaching
for
his
hip
pocket
and
the
rest
crowding
up
around
him
it
s
only
me
i
quavered
that
is
i
the
the
dish
pan
dish
pan
bella
said
from
back
in
the
crowd
kit
of
course
jim
forced
his
way
through
then
and
turned
on
the
lights
i
have
no
doubt
i
looked
very
strange
kneeling
there
on
the
bare
floor
with
a
row
of
pans
mounted
on
bricks
behind
me
and
the
furniture
all
piled
on
itself
in
a
back
corner
kit
what
in
the
world
jim
began
and
stopped
he
stared
from
me
to
the
pans
to
the
windows
to
the
on
the
mantel
and
back
to
me
i
sat
stonily
silent
why
should
i
explain
whenever
i
got
into
a
foolish
position
and
tried
to
explain
and
tell
how
it
happened
and
who
was
really
to
blame
they
always
brought
it
back
to
me
somehow
so
i
sat
there
on
the
floor
and
let
them
stare
and
finally
lollie
mercer
got
her
breath
and
said
how
perfectly
lovely
it
s
a
charade
and
anne
guessed
kitchen
at
once
kit
you
know
and
the
pans
and
all
that
she
said
vaguely
at
that
they
all
took
to
guessing
and
i
sat
still
until
harbison
saw
the
storm
in
my
eyes
and
came
over
to
me
have
you
hurt
your
ankle
he
said
in
an
undertone
let
me
help
you
i
am
not
hurt
i
said
coldly
and
even
if
i
were
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
trouble
i
can
not
help
being
troubled
he
returned
just
as
evenly
you
see
it
makes
me
ill
for
days
if
my
car
runs
over
a
luckily
at
that
moment
dal
came
in
he
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
without
a
word
shut
off
the
lights
crashed
through
the
pans
and
slammed
the
shutters
closed
then
he
turned
and
addressed
the
rest
of
all
the
lunatics
he
began
only
there
was
more
to
it
than
that
a
fellow
goes
to
all
kinds
of
trouble
to
put
an
end
to
this
miserable
situation
and
the
entire
household
turns
out
and
sets
to
work
to
frustrate
the
whole
scheme
you
like
to
stay
here
don
t
you
like
chickens
in
a
coop
where
s
flannigan
nobody
understood
dal
s
wrath
then
but
it
seems
he
meant
to
arrange
the
plot
himself
and
when
it
was
ripe
and
the
hour
nearly
come
he
intended
to
wager
that
he
could
break
the
quarantine
and
to
take
any
odds
he
could
get
that
he
would
free
the
entire
party
in
half
an
hour
as
for
the
plan
itself
it
was
idiotically
simple
we
were
perfectly
delighted
when
we
heard
it
it
was
so
simple
and
yet
so
comprehensive
we
didn
t
see
how
it
could
fail
both
the
mercer
girls
kissed
dal
on
the
strength
of
it
and
anne
was
furious
jim
was
not
so
much
pleased
for
some
reason
or
other
and
harbison
looked
thoughtful
rather
than
merry
aunt
selina
had
gone
to
bed
the
idea
of
course
was
to
start
an
embryo
fire
just
inside
the
windows
in
the
pans
to
feed
it
with
the
powder
that
is
used
on
the
fourth
of
july
and
when
we
had
thrown
open
the
windows
and
yelled
fire
and
all
the
guards
and
reporters
had
rushed
to
the
front
of
the
house
to
escape
quietly
by
a
rear
door
from
the
basement
kitchen
get
into
machines
dal
had
in
waiting
and
lose
ourselves
as
quickly
as
we
could
you
can
see
how
simple
it
was
we
were
terribly
excited
of
course
every
one
rushed
madly
for
motor
coats
and
veils
and
dal
shuffled
the
numbers
so
the
people
going
the
same
direction
would
have
the
same
machine
we
called
to
each
other
as
we
dressed
about
mamaroneck
or
lakewood
or
wherever
we
happened
to
have
relatives
everybody
knew
everybody
else
and
his
friends
the
mercer
girls
were
going
to
cruise
until
the
trouble
blew
over
the
browns
were
going
to
pinehurst
and
jim
was
going
to
africa
to
hunt
if
he
could
get
out
of
the
harbor
only
the
harbison
man
seemed
to
have
no
plans
quite
suddenly
with
the
world
so
near
again
the
world
of
country
houses
and
steam
yachts
and
all
the
rest
of
it
he
ceased
to
be
one
of
us
it
was
not
his
world
at
all
he
stood
back
and
watched
the
kaleidoscope
of
our
coats
and
veils
but
with
something
in
his
face
that
i
had
not
seen
there
before
if
he
had
not
been
so
and
big
i
would
have
said
he
was
lonely
not
that
he
was
pathetic
in
any
sense
of
the
word
of
course
he
avoided
me
which
was
natural
and
exactly
what
i
wished
bella
never
was
far
from
him
and
at
the
last
she
loaded
him
with
her
jewel
case
and
a
muff
and
traveling
bag
and
asked
him
to
her
cousins
on
long
island
i
felt
sure
he
was
going
to
decline
when
he
glanced
across
at
me
do
go
i
said
very
politely
they
are
charming
and
he
accepted
at
once
it
was
a
transparent
plot
on
bella
s
part
two
elderly
maiden
ladies
house
miles
from
anywhere
long
evenings
in
the
music
room
with
an
open
fire
and
bella
at
the
harp
playing
the
two
songs
she
knows
when
we
were
ready
and
gathered
in
the
kitchen
in
the
darkness
of
course
dal
went
up
on
the
roof
and
signaled
with
a
lantern
to
the
cars
on
the
drive
then
he
went
downstairs
took
a
last
look
at
the
drawing
room
fired
the
papers
shook
on
the
powder
opened
the
windows
and
yelled
fire
of
course
huddled
in
the
kitchen
we
had
heard
little
or
nothing
but
we
plainly
heard
dal
on
the
first
floor
and
flannigan
on
the
second
yelling
fire
and
the
patter
of
feet
as
the
guards
ran
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
at
that
instant
we
remembered
aunt
selina
that
was
the
cause
of
the
whole
trouble
i
don
t
know
why
they
turned
on
me
she
wasn
t
my
aunt
but
by
the
time
we
had
got
her
out
of
bed
and
had
wrapped
her
in
an
eiderdown
comfort
and
stuck
slippers
on
her
feet
and
a
motor
veil
on
her
head
the
glare
at
the
front
of
the
house
was
beginning
to
die
away
she
didn
t
understand
at
all
and
we
had
no
time
to
explain
i
remember
that
she
wanted
to
go
back
and
get
her
plate
whatever
that
may
be
but
jim
took
her
by
the
arm
and
hurried
her
along
and
the
rest
who
had
waited
and
were
in
awful
tempers
stood
aside
and
let
them
out
first
the
door
to
the
area
steps
was
open
and
by
the
street
lights
we
could
see
a
fence
and
a
gate
which
opened
on
a
side
street
jim
and
aunt
selina
ran
straight
for
the
gate
the
wind
blowing
aunt
selina
s
comfort
like
a
sail
then
with
our
feet
so
to
speak
on
the
first
rungs
of
the
ladder
of
liberty
it
slipped
a
guards
and
reporters
came
around
the
house
and
drove
us
back
like
sheep
into
a
slaughter
pen
it
was
the
most
humiliating
moment
of
my
life
dal
had
been
for
fighting
a
way
through
and
just
for
a
minute
i
think
i
went
berserk
myself
but
max
spied
one
of
the
reporters
setting
up
a
flash
light
as
we
stood
undecided
at
the
top
of
the
steps
and
after
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
retreat
we
backed
down
slowly
to
show
them
we
were
not
afraid
and
when
we
were
all
in
the
kitchen
again
and
had
turned
on
the
lights
and
bella
was
crying
with
her
head
against
harbison
s
arm
dal
said
cheerfully
well
it
has
done
some
good
anyhow
we
have
lost
aunt
and
we
all
shook
hands
on
it
although
we
were
sorry
about
jim
and
dal
said
we
would
have
some
champagne
and
drink
to
aunt
selina
s
comfort
and
we
could
have
her
teeth
fumigated
and
send
them
to
her
somebody
said
poor
old
jim
and
at
that
bella
looked
up
she
stared
around
the
group
and
then
she
went
quite
pale
jim
she
gasped
do
you
mean
that
jim
is
out
there
too
jim
and
aunt
selina
i
said
as
calmly
as
i
could
for
joy
you
can
see
how
it
simplified
the
situation
for
me
by
this
time
they
are
a
mile
away
and
going
everybody
shook
hands
again
except
bella
she
had
dropped
into
a
chair
and
sat
biting
her
lip
and
breathing
hard
and
she
would
not
join
in
any
of
the
hilarity
at
getting
rid
of
aunt
selina
finally
she
got
up
and
knocked
over
her
chair
you
are
a
lot
of
cowards
she
stormed
you
deserted
them
out
there
left
them
heaven
knows
where
they
are
a
defenseless
old
woman
and
and
a
man
who
did
not
even
have
an
overcoat
and
it
is
snowing
never
mind
dal
said
reassuringly
he
can
borrow
aunt
selina
s
comfort
make
the
old
lady
discard
from
weakness
anyhow
bella
if
i
know
anything
of
human
nature
the
old
lady
will
make
it
hot
enough
for
him
poor
old
jim
then
they
shook
hands
again
and
with
that
there
came
a
terrible
banging
at
the
door
which
we
had
locked
open
the
door
some
one
commanded
it
was
one
of
the
guards
open
it
yourself
dallas
called
moving
a
kitchen
table
to
reenforce
the
lock
open
that
door
or
we
will
break
it
in
dallas
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
seated
himself
on
the
table
and
whistled
cheerfully
we
could
hear
them
conferring
outside
and
they
made
another
appeal
which
was
refused
suddenly
bella
came
over
and
confronted
dallas
they
have
brought
them
back
she
said
dramatically
they
are
out
there
now
i
distinctly
heard
jim
s
voice
open
that
door
dallas
oh
don
t
let
them
in
i
wailed
it
was
quite
involuntary
but
the
disappointment
was
too
awful
dallas
don
t
open
that
door
dal
swung
his
feet
and
smiled
from
bella
to
me
think
what
a
solution
it
is
to
all
our
difficulties
he
said
easily
without
aunt
selina
i
could
be
happy
here
there
was
more
knocking
and
somebody
max
i
think
said
to
let
them
in
that
it
was
a
fool
thing
anyhow
and
that
he
wanted
to
go
to
bed
and
forget
it
his
feet
were
cold
and
just
then
there
was
a
crash
and
part
of
one
of
the
windows
fell
in
the
next
blow
from
outside
brought
the
rest
of
the
glass
and
somebody
was
coming
through
feet
first
it
was
jim
he
did
not
speak
to
any
of
us
but
turned
and
helped
in
a
bundle
of
red
and
yellow
silk
comfort
that
proved
to
be
aunt
selina
also
feet
first
i
had
a
glimpse
of
a
heads
outside
guards
and
reporters
then
jim
jerked
the
shade
down
and
unswathed
aunt
selina
s
legs
so
that
she
could
walk
offered
his
arm
and
stalked
past
us
and
upstairs
without
a
word
none
of
us
spoke
we
turned
out
the
lights
and
went
upstairs
and
took
off
our
wraps
and
went
to
bed
it
had
been
almost
a
fiasco
chapter
xv
suspicion
and
discord
every
one
was
nasty
the
next
morning
aunt
selina
declared
that
her
feet
were
and
kept
bella
rubbing
them
with
ice
water
all
morning
and
jim
was
impossible
he
refused
to
speak
to
any
of
us
and
he
watched
bella
furtively
as
if
he
suspected
her
of
trying
to
get
him
out
of
the
house
when
luncheon
time
came
around
and
he
had
shown
no
indication
of
going
to
the
telephone
and
ordering
it
we
had
a
conclave
and
max
was
chosen
to
remind
him
of
the
hour
jim
was
shut
in
the
studio
and
we
waited
together
in
the
hall
while
max
went
up
when
he
came
down
he
was
somewhat
ruffled
he
wouldn
t
open
the
door
he
reported
and
when
i
told
him
it
was
meal
time
he
said
he
wasn
t
hungry
and
he
didn
t
give
a
whoop
about
the
rest
of
us
he
had
asked
us
here
to
dinner
he
hadn
t
proposed
to
adopt
so
we
finally
ordered
luncheon
ourselves
and
about
two
o
clock
jim
came
downstairs
sheepishly
and
ate
what
was
left
anne
declared
that
bella
had
been
scolding
him
in
the
upper
hall
but
i
doubted
it
she
was
never
seen
to
speak
to
him
unnecessarily
the
excitement
of
the
escape
over
harbison
and
i
remained
on
terms
of
armed
neutrality
and
max
still
hunted
for
anne
s
pearls
using
them
the
men
declared
as
a
good
excuse
to
avoid
tinkering
with
the
furnace
or
repairing
the
dumb
waiter
which
took
the
queerest
notions
and
stopped
once
up
from
the
kitchen
for
an
hour
with
the
dinner
on
it
anyhow
max
was
searching
the
house
systematically
armed
with
a
copy
of
poe
s
purloined
letter
and
gaboriau
s
monsieur
lecoq
he
went
through
the
seats
of
the
chairs
with
hatpins
tore
up
the
beds
and
lifted
rugs
until
the
house
was
in
a
state
of
confusion
and
the
next
day
the
fourth
he
found
something
not
much
but
it
was
curious
he
had
been
in
the
studio
poking
around
behind
the
dusty
pictures
with
jimmy
expostulating
every
time
he
moved
anything
and
the
rest
standing
around
watching
him
max
was
strutting
we
get
it
by
elimination
he
said
importantly
the
pearls
being
nowhere
else
in
the
house
they
must
be
here
in
the
studio
three
parts
of
the
studio
having
yielded
nothing
they
must
be
in
the
fourth
ladies
and
gentlemen
let
me
have
your
attention
for
one
moment
i
tap
this
canvas
with
my
wand
there
is
nothing
up
my
sleeve
then
i
prepare
to
move
the
canvas
so
and
i
put
my
hand
in
the
pocket
of
this
disreputable
velvet
coat
so
behold
then
he
gave
a
low
exclamation
and
looked
at
something
he
held
in
his
hand
every
one
stepped
forward
and
on
his
palm
was
the
small
diamond
clasp
from
anne
s
collar
jimmy
was
apoplectic
he
tried
to
smile
but
no
one
else
did
well
i
ll
be
flabbergasted
he
said
i
say
you
people
you
don
t
think
for
a
minute
that
i
put
that
thing
there
why
i
haven
t
worn
that
coat
for
a
month
it
s
it
s
a
trick
of
yours
but
max
shook
his
head
he
looked
stupefied
and
stood
gazing
from
the
clasp
to
the
pocket
of
the
old
painting
coat
betty
dropped
on
a
folding
stool
that
promptly
collapsed
with
her
and
created
a
welcome
diversion
while
anne
pounced
on
the
clasp
greedily
with
a
little
cry
we
will
find
it
all
now
she
said
excitedly
did
you
look
in
the
other
pockets
max
then
for
the
first
time
i
was
conscious
of
an
air
of
constraint
among
the
men
dallas
was
whistling
softly
and
harbison
having
rescued
betty
was
standing
silent
and
aloof
watching
the
scene
with
eyes
it
was
max
who
spoke
first
after
a
hurried
inventory
of
the
other
pockets
nothing
else
he
said
constrainedly
i
ll
move
the
rest
of
the
but
jim
interfered
to
every
one
s
surprise
i
wouldn
t
if
i
were
you
max
there
s
nothing
back
there
i
had
em
out
he
was
quite
pale
nonsense
max
said
gruffly
if
it
s
a
practical
joke
jim
why
don
t
you
fess
up
anne
has
worried
the
pearls
are
not
there
i
tell
you
jim
began
although
the
studio
was
cold
there
were
little
fine
beads
of
moisture
on
his
face
i
must
ask
you
not
to
move
those
and
then
aunt
selina
came
to
the
rescue
she
stalked
over
and
stood
with
her
back
against
the
stack
of
canvases
as
far
as
i
can
understand
this
she
declaimed
you
gentlemen
are
trying
to
intimate
that
james
knows
something
of
that
young
woman
s
jewelry
because
you
found
part
of
it
in
his
pocket
certainly
you
will
not
move
the
pictures
how
do
you
know
that
the
young
gentleman
who
said
he
found
it
there
didn
t
have
it
up
his
sleeve
she
looked
around
triumphantly
and
max
glowered
dallas
soothed
her
however
exactly
so
he
said
how
do
we
know
that
max
didn
t
have
the
clasp
up
his
sleeve
my
dear
lady
neither
my
wife
nor
i
care
anything
for
the
pearls
as
compared
with
the
priceless
pearl
of
peace
i
suggest
tea
on
the
roof
those
in
favor
my
arm
miss
it
was
all
well
enough
for
jim
to
say
later
that
he
didn
t
dare
to
have
the
canvases
moved
for
he
had
stuck
behind
them
all
sorts
of
chorus
girl
photographs
and
crayons
that
were
not
for
aunt
selina
s
eye
besides
four
empty
siphons
two
full
ones
and
three
bottles
of
whisky
not
a
soul
believed
him
there
was
a
a
new
element
of
suspicion
and
discord
in
the
house
every
one
went
up
on
the
roof
and
left
him
to
his
mystery
anne
drank
her
tea
in
a
preoccupied
silence
with
eyes
an
attitude
that
boded
ill
to
somebody
the
rest
were
feverishly
gay
and
aunt
selina
with
a
pair
of
arctics
on
her
feet
and
a
bottle
at
her
back
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
tent
and
told
me
familiar
anecdotes
of
jimmy
s
early
youth
had
he
known
he
would
have
slain
her
betty
and
harbison
had
found
a
medicine
ball
and
were
running
around
like
a
pair
of
children
it
was
quite
certain
that
neither
his
escape
from
death
nor
my
accusation
weighed
heavily
on
him
while
aunt
selina
was
busy
with
the
time
jim
had
swallowed
an
open
safety
pin
and
just
as
the
pin
had
been
coughed
up
or
taken
out
of
his
nose
i
forget
which
jim
himself
appeared
and
sulkily
demanded
the
privacy
of
the
roof
for
his
training
hour
yes
he
was
training
flannigan
claimed
to
know
the
system
that
had
reduced
the
president
to
what
he
is
and
he
and
jim
had
a
seance
every
day
which
left
jim
feeling
himself
for
bruises
all
evening
he
claimed
to
be
losing
flesh
he
said
he
could
actually
feel
it
going
and
he
and
flannigan
had
spent
an
entire
afternoon
in
the
cellar
three
days
before
with
a
potato
barrel
a
chair
and
a
lamp
the
whole
thing
had
been
shrouded
in
mystery
they
sandpapered
the
inside
of
the
barrel
and
took
out
all
the
nails
and
when
they
had
finished
they
carried
it
to
the
roof
and
put
it
in
a
corner
behind
the
tent
everybody
was
curious
but
flannigan
refused
any
information
about
it
and
merely
said
it
was
part
of
his
system
dal
said
that
if
he
had
anything
like
that
in
his
system
he
certainly
would
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
it
at
a
quarter
to
six
jim
appeared
still
sullen
from
the
events
of
the
afternoon
and
wearing
a
dressing
gown
and
a
pair
of
slippers
flannigan
following
him
with
a
sponge
a
bucket
of
water
and
an
armful
of
bath
towels
everybody
protested
at
having
to
move
but
he
was
firm
and
they
all
filed
down
the
stairs
i
was
the
last
with
aunt
selina
just
ahead
of
me
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
she
turned
around
suddenly
to
me
that
policeman
looks
cruel
she
said
what
s
more
he
s
been
in
a
bad
humor
all
day
more
than
likely
he
ll
put
james
flat
on
the
roof
and
tramp
on
him
under
pretense
of
training
him
all
policemen
are
he
only
rolls
him
over
a
barrel
or
something
like
that
i
protested
james
had
a
bump
like
an
egg
over
his
ear
last
night
aunt
selina
insisted
glaring
at
flannigan
s
unconscious
back
i
don
t
think
it
s
safe
to
leave
him
it
is
my
time
to
relax
for
thirty
minutes
or
i
would
watch
him
you
will
have
to
stay
she
said
fixing
me
with
her
imperious
eyes
so
i
stayed
jim
didn
t
want
me
and
flannigan
muttered
mutiny
but
it
was
easier
to
obey
aunt
selina
than
to
clash
with
her
and
anyhow
i
wanted
to
see
the
barrel
in
use
i
never
saw
any
one
train
before
it
is
not
a
joyful
spectacle
first
flannigan
made
jim
run
around
and
around
the
roof
he
said
it
stirred
up
his
food
and
brought
it
in
contact
with
his
liver
to
be
digested
flannigan
from
meekness
and
submission
of
a
sort
in
the
kitchen
became
an
autocrat
on
the
roof
once
more
he
would
say
pick
up
your
feet
sir
pick
up
your
feet
and
jim
would
stagger
doggedly
past
me
where
i
sat
on
the
parapet
his
poor
cheeks
shaking
and
the
tail
of
his
bath
robe
wrapping
itself
around
his
legs
yes
he
ran
in
the
bath
robe
in
deference
to
me
it
seems
there
isn
t
much
to
a
running
suit
head
up
flannigan
would
say
lift
your
knees
sir
didn
t
you
ever
see
a
horse
with
string
halt
he
let
him
stop
finally
and
gave
him
a
moment
to
get
his
breath
then
he
set
him
to
turning
somersaults
they
spread
the
cushions
from
the
couch
in
the
tent
on
the
roof
and
jim
would
poke
his
head
down
and
say
a
prayer
and
then
curve
over
as
gracefully
as
a
sausage
and
come
up
gasping
as
if
he
had
been
pushed
off
a
boat
five
pounds
a
day
not
less
sir
flannigan
said
encouragingly
you
ll
drop
it
in
jim
looked
at
the
tin
as
if
he
expected
to
see
the
chunks
lying
at
his
feet
yes
he
said
wiping
the
back
of
his
neck
if
we
re
in
here
thirty
days
that
will
be
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
don
t
forget
to
stop
in
time
flannigan
i
don
t
want
to
melt
away
like
a
he
was
cheered
however
by
the
promise
of
reduction
what
do
you
think
of
that
kit
he
called
to
me
your
uncle
is
going
to
look
as
angular
as
a
problem
in
geometry
i
ll
i
ll
be
the
original
reductio
ad
absurdum
do
you
want
me
to
stand
on
my
head
flannigan
wouldn
t
that
reduce
something
your
brains
sir
flannigan
retorted
gravely
and
presented
a
pair
of
boxing
gloves
jim
visibly
quailed
but
he
put
them
on
do
you
know
flannigan
he
remarked
as
he
fastened
them
i
m
thinking
of
wearing
these
all
the
time
they
hide
my
flannigan
looked
puzzled
but
he
did
not
ask
an
explanation
he
demanded
that
jim
shed
the
bath
robe
which
he
finally
did
on
my
promise
to
watch
the
sunset
then
for
fully
a
minute
there
was
no
sound
save
of
feet
running
rapidly
around
the
roof
and
an
occasional
soft
thud
each
thud
was
accompanied
by
a
grunt
or
two
from
jim
flannigan
was
grimly
silent
once
there
was
a
smart
rap
an
oath
from
the
policeman
and
a
mirthless
chuckle
from
jim
the
chuckle
ended
in
a
crash
however
and
i
turned
jim
was
lying
on
his
back
on
the
roof
and
flannigan
was
wiping
his
ear
with
a
towel
jim
sat
up
and
ran
his
hand
down
his
ribs
they
re
all
here
he
observed
after
a
minute
i
thought
i
missed
the
only
way
to
take
a
man
s
weight
down
flannigan
said
dryly
jim
got
up
dizzily
down
on
the
roof
i
suppose
you
mean
he
said
the
next
proceedings
were
mysterious
flannigan
rolled
the
barrel
into
the
tent
and
carried
in
a
small
glass
lamp
with
the
material
at
hand
he
seemed
to
be
effecting
a
combination
no
new
one
to
judge
by
his
facility
then
he
called
jim
at
the
door
of
the
tent
jim
turned
to
me
his
bathrobe
toga
fashion
around
his
shoulders
this
is
a
very
essential
part
of
the
treatment
he
said
solemnly
the
exercise
according
to
flannigan
loosens
up
the
adipose
tissue
the
next
step
is
to
boil
it
out
i
hope
unless
your
instructions
compel
you
that
you
will
at
least
have
the
decency
to
stay
out
of
the
i
am
going
at
once
i
said
outraged
i
m
not
here
because
i
m
mad
about
it
and
you
know
it
and
don
t
pose
with
that
bath
robe
if
you
think
you
re
a
character
out
of
roman
history
look
at
your
i
didn
t
mean
to
offend
you
he
said
sulkily
only
i
m
tired
of
having
you
choked
down
my
throat
every
time
i
open
my
mouth
kit
and
don
t
go
just
yet
flannigan
is
going
for
my
clothes
as
soon
as
he
lights
the
the
lamp
and
somebody
ought
to
watch
the
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
i
said
i
would
guard
the
steps
and
flannigan
having
ignited
the
combination
whatever
it
was
went
downstairs
how
was
i
to
know
that
bella
would
come
up
when
she
did
was
it
my
fault
that
the
lamp
got
too
high
and
that
flannigan
couldn
t
hear
jim
calling
or
that
just
as
bella
reached
the
top
of
the
steps
jim
should
come
to
the
door
of
the
tent
wearing
the
barrel
part
of
his
cabinet
and
yelling
for
a
doctor
bella
came
to
a
dead
stop
on
the
upper
step
with
her
mouth
open
she
looked
at
jim
at
the
inadequate
barrel
and
from
them
she
looked
at
me
then
she
began
to
laugh
one
of
her
hysterical
giggles
and
she
turned
and
went
down
again
as
jim
and
i
stared
at
each
other
we
could
hear
her
gurgling
down
the
hall
below
she
had
violent
hysterics
for
an
hour
with
anne
rubbing
her
forehead
and
aunt
selina
burning
a
feather
out
of
the
feather
duster
under
her
nose
only
jim
and
i
understood
and
we
did
not
tell
luckily
the
next
thing
that
occurred
drove
bella
and
her
nerves
from
everybody
s
mind
at
seven
o
clock
when
bella
had
dropped
asleep
and
everybody
else
was
dressed
for
dinner
aunt
selina
discovered
that
the
house
was
cold
and
ordered
dal
to
the
furnace
it
was
dal
s
day
at
the
furnace
flannigan
had
been
relieved
of
that
part
of
the
work
after
twice
setting
fire
to
a
chimney
in
five
minutes
dal
came
back
and
spoke
a
few
words
to
max
who
followed
him
to
the
basement
and
in
ten
minutes
more
flannigan
puffed
up
the
steps
and
called
harbison
i
am
not
curious
but
i
knew
that
something
had
happened
while
aunt
selina
was
talking
suffrage
to
anne
who
said
she
had
always
been
tremendously
interested
in
the
subject
and
if
women
got
the
suffrage
would
they
be
allowed
to
vote
i
slipped
back
to
the
dining
room
the
table
was
laid
for
dinner
but
flannigan
was
not
in
sight
i
could
hear
voices
from
somewhere
faint
voices
that
talked
rapidly
and
after
a
while
i
located
the
sounds
under
my
feet
the
men
were
all
in
the
basement
and
something
must
have
happened
i
flew
back
to
the
basement
stairs
to
meet
harbison
at
the
foot
he
was
grimy
and
dusty
with
streaks
of
coal
dust
over
his
face
and
he
had
been
examining
his
revolver
i
was
just
in
time
to
see
him
slip
it
into
his
pocket
what
is
the
matter
i
demanded
is
any
one
hurt
no
one
he
said
coolly
we
ve
been
cleaning
out
the
with
a
revolver
how
interesting
and
unusual
i
said
dryly
and
slipped
past
him
as
he
barred
the
way
he
was
not
pleased
i
heard
him
mutter
something
and
come
rapidly
after
me
but
i
had
the
voices
as
a
guide
and
i
was
not
going
to
be
turned
back
like
a
child
the
men
had
gathered
around
a
low
stone
arch
in
the
furnace
room
and
were
looking
down
a
short
flight
of
steps
into
a
sort
of
vault
evidently
under
the
pavement
a
faint
light
came
from
a
small
grating
above
and
there
was
a
close
musty
smell
in
the
air
i
tell
you
it
must
have
been
last
night
dallas
was
saying
wilson
and
i
were
here
before
we
went
to
bed
and
i
ll
swear
that
hole
was
not
there
it
was
not
there
this
morning
sir
flannigan
insisted
it
has
been
made
during
the
and
it
could
not
have
been
done
this
afternoon
harbison
said
quietly
i
was
fussing
with
the
telephone
wire
down
here
i
would
have
heard
the
something
in
his
voice
made
me
look
at
him
and
certainly
his
expression
was
unusual
he
was
watching
us
all
intently
while
dallas
pointed
out
to
me
the
cause
of
the
excitement
from
the
main
floor
of
the
furnace
room
a
flight
of
stone
steps
surmounted
by
an
arch
led
into
the
coal
cellar
beneath
the
street
the
coal
cellar
was
of
brick
with
a
cement
floor
and
in
the
left
wall
there
gaped
an
opening
about
three
feet
by
three
leading
into
a
cavernous
void
perfectly
black
evidently
a
similar
vault
belonging
to
the
next
house
the
whole
place
was
ghostly
full
of
shadows
shivery
with
possibilities
it
was
harbison
finally
who
took
jim
s
candle
and
crawled
through
the
aperture
we
waited
in
dead
silence
listening
to
his
feet
crunching
over
the
coal
beyond
watching
the
faint
yellow
light
that
came
through
the
ragged
opening
in
the
wall
then
he
came
back
and
called
through
to
us
place
is
locked
over
here
he
said
heavy
oak
door
at
the
head
of
the
steps
whoever
made
that
opening
has
done
a
prodigious
amount
of
labor
for
the
weapon
a
crowbar
lay
on
the
ground
beside
the
bricks
and
he
picked
it
up
and
balanced
it
on
his
hand
dallas
florid
face
was
almost
comical
in
his
bewilderment
as
for
jimmy
he
slammed
a
piece
of
slag
at
the
furnace
and
walked
away
at
the
door
he
turned
around
why
don
t
you
accuse
me
of
it
he
asked
bitterly
maybe
you
could
find
a
lump
of
coal
in
my
pockets
if
you
searched
he
stalked
up
the
stairs
then
and
left
us
dallas
and
i
went
up
together
but
we
did
not
talk
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
say
not
until
i
had
closed
and
locked
the
door
of
my
room
did
i
venture
to
look
at
something
that
i
carried
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
it
was
a
watch
not
running
a
gentleman
s
flat
gold
watch
and
it
had
been
hanging
by
its
fob
to
a
nail
in
the
bricks
beside
the
aperture
in
the
back
of
the
watch
were
the
initials
and
the
picture
of
a
girl
cut
from
a
newspaper
it
was
my
picture
chapter
xvi
i
face
flannigan
dinner
waited
that
night
while
everybody
went
to
the
coal
cellar
and
stared
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
and
watched
while
max
took
a
tracing
of
it
and
of
some
footprints
in
the
coal
dust
on
the
other
side
i
did
not
go
i
went
into
the
library
with
the
guilty
watch
in
the
fold
of
my
gown
and
found
harbison
there
staring
through
the
february
gloom
at
the
blank
wall
of
the
next
house
and
quite
unconscious
of
the
reporter
with
a
drawing
pad
just
below
him
in
the
i
went
over
and
closed
the
shutters
before
his
very
eyes
but
even
then
he
did
not
move
will
you
be
good
enough
to
turn
around
i
demanded
at
last
oh
he
said
wheeling
are
you
here
there
wasn
t
any
reply
to
that
so
i
took
the
watch
and
placed
it
on
the
library
table
between
us
the
effect
was
all
that
i
had
hoped
he
stared
at
it
for
an
instant
then
at
me
and
with
his
hand
outstretched
for
it
stopped
where
did
you
find
it
he
asked
i
couldn
t
understand
his
expression
he
looked
embarrassed
but
not
at
all
afraid
i
think
you
know
harbison
i
retorted
i
wish
i
did
you
opened
it
we
stood
looking
at
each
other
across
the
table
it
was
his
glance
that
wavered
about
the
picture
of
you
he
said
at
last
you
see
down
there
in
south
america
a
fellow
hasn
t
much
to
do
in
the
evenings
and
a
a
chum
of
mine
and
i
we
were
awfully
down
on
what
we
called
the
plutocrats
the
the
leisure
classes
and
when
that
picture
of
yours
came
in
the
paper
we
had
we
had
an
argument
he
said
he
stopped
what
did
he
say
well
he
said
it
was
the
picture
of
an
society
oh
i
exclaimed
i
i
maintained
there
were
possibilities
in
the
he
put
both
hands
on
the
table
and
bending
forward
looked
down
at
me
well
i
was
a
fool
i
admit
i
said
your
eyes
were
kind
and
candid
in
spite
of
that
haughty
mouth
you
see
i
said
i
was
a
i
think
you
are
exceedingly
rude
i
managed
finally
if
you
want
to
know
where
i
found
your
watch
it
was
down
in
the
coal
cellar
and
if
you
admit
you
are
an
idiot
i
am
not
i
i
know
all
about
bella
s
bracelet
and
the
board
on
the
roof
and
oh
if
you
would
only
leave
anne
s
necklace
on
the
coal
or
somewhere
and
get
away
my
voice
got
beyond
me
then
and
i
dropped
into
a
chair
and
covered
my
face
i
could
feel
him
staring
at
the
back
of
my
head
well
i
ll
be
something
or
other
he
said
finally
and
then
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
out
by
the
time
i
got
my
eyes
dry
yes
i
was
crying
i
always
do
when
i
am
angry
i
heard
jim
coming
downstairs
and
i
tucked
the
watch
out
of
sight
would
anyone
have
foreseen
the
trouble
that
watch
would
make
jim
was
sulky
he
dropped
into
a
chair
and
stretched
out
his
legs
looking
gloomily
at
nothing
then
he
got
up
and
ambled
into
his
den
closing
the
door
behind
him
without
having
spoken
a
word
it
was
more
than
human
nature
could
stand
when
i
went
into
the
den
he
was
stretched
on
the
davenport
with
his
face
buried
in
the
cushions
he
looked
absolutely
wilted
and
every
line
of
him
was
drooping
go
on
out
kit
he
said
in
a
smothered
voice
be
a
good
girl
and
don
t
follow
me
you
are
shameless
i
gasped
follow
you
when
you
are
hung
around
my
neck
like
a
like
a
millstone
was
what
i
wanted
to
say
but
i
couldn
t
think
of
it
he
turned
over
and
looked
up
from
his
cushions
like
an
and
suffering
cherub
i
m
done
for
kit
he
groaned
bella
went
up
to
the
studio
after
we
left
and
investigated
that
what
did
she
find
the
necklace
i
asked
eagerly
he
was
too
wretched
to
notice
this
no
that
picture
of
you
that
i
did
last
winter
she
is
crazy
she
says
she
is
going
upstairs
and
sit
in
takahiro
s
room
and
take
smallpox
and
fiddlesticks
i
said
rudely
and
somebody
hammered
on
the
door
and
opened
it
pardon
me
for
disturbing
you
bella
said
in
her
best
manner
but
flannigan
says
the
dinner
has
not
good
lord
jim
exclaimed
i
forgot
to
order
the
confounded
dinner
it
was
eight
o
clock
by
that
time
and
as
it
took
an
hour
at
least
after
telephoning
the
order
everybody
looked
blank
when
they
heard
the
entire
family
except
harbison
who
had
not
appeared
again
escorted
jim
to
the
telephone
and
hung
around
hungrily
suggesting
new
dishes
every
minute
and
then
he
couldn
t
raise
central
it
was
fifteen
minutes
before
we
gave
up
and
stood
staring
at
one
another
despairingly
call
out
of
a
window
and
get
one
of
those
infernal
reporters
to
do
something
useful
for
once
max
suggested
but
he
was
indignantly
hushed
we
would
have
starved
first
jim
was
peering
into
the
transmitter
and
knocking
the
receiver
against
his
hand
like
a
watch
that
had
stopped
but
nothing
happened
flannigan
reported
a
box
of
breakfast
food
two
lemons
and
a
pineapple
cheese
a
combination
that
didn
t
seem
to
lend
itself
to
anything
we
went
back
to
the
dining
room
from
sheer
force
of
habit
and
sat
around
the
table
and
looked
at
the
lemonade
flannigan
had
made
anne
would
talk
about
the
salad
her
last
cook
had
concocted
and
max
told
about
a
little
town
in
connecticut
where
the
restaurant
keeper
smokes
a
pipe
while
he
cooks
the
most
luscious
fried
clams
in
america
and
aunt
selina
related
that
in
her
family
they
had
a
recipe
for
chicken
smothered
in
cream
and
then
we
sipped
the
weak
lemonade
and
nibbled
at
the
cheese
to
change
this
gridiron
martyrdom
dallas
said
finally
where
s
harbison
still
looking
for
his
watch
watch
everybody
said
it
in
a
different
tone
sure
he
responded
says
his
watch
was
taken
last
night
from
the
studio
better
get
him
down
to
take
a
squint
at
the
telephone
likely
he
can
fix
flannigan
was
beside
me
with
the
cheese
and
at
that
moment
i
felt
harbison
s
stolen
watch
slip
out
of
my
girdle
slide
greasily
across
my
lap
and
clatter
to
the
floor
flannigan
stooped
but
luckily
it
had
gone
under
the
table
to
have
had
it
picked
up
to
have
had
to
explain
how
i
got
it
to
see
them
try
to
ignore
my
picture
pasted
in
it
oh
it
was
impossible
i
put
my
foot
over
it
drop
something
dallas
asked
perfunctorily
rising
flannigan
was
still
half
kneeling
a
fork
i
said
as
easily
as
i
could
and
the
conversation
went
on
but
flannigan
knew
and
i
knew
he
knew
he
watched
my
every
movement
like
a
hawk
after
that
standing
just
behind
my
chair
i
dropped
my
useless
napkin
to
have
it
whirled
up
before
it
reached
the
floor
i
said
to
betty
that
my
shoe
buckle
was
loose
and
actually
got
the
watch
in
my
hand
only
to
let
it
slip
at
the
critical
moment
then
they
all
got
up
and
went
sadly
back
to
the
library
and
flannigan
and
i
faced
each
other
flannigan
was
not
a
handsome
man
at
any
time
though
up
to
then
he
had
at
least
looked
amiable
but
now
as
i
stood
with
my
hand
on
the
back
of
my
chair
his
face
grew
suddenly
menacing
the
silence
was
absolute
i
was
the
guiltiest
wretch
alive
and
opposite
me
the
law
towered
and
glowered
and
held
the
yellow
remnant
of
a
pineapple
cheese
and
in
the
silence
that
wretched
watch
lay
and
ticked
and
ticked
and
ticked
then
flannigan
creaked
over
and
closed
the
door
into
the
hall
came
back
picked
up
the
watch
and
looked
at
it
you
re
unlucky
i
m
thinkin
he
said
finally
you
ve
got
the
nerve
all
right
but
you
ain
t
cute
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
i
quavered
give
me
that
watch
to
return
to
not
on
your
life
he
retorted
easily
i
give
it
back
myself
like
i
did
the
bracelet
and
like
i
m
going
to
give
back
the
necklace
if
you
ll
act
like
a
sensible
little
i
could
only
choke
it
s
foolish
any
way
you
look
at
it
he
persisted
here
you
are
lots
of
friends
folks
that
think
you
re
all
right
why
i
reckon
there
isn
t
one
of
them
that
wouldn
t
lend
you
money
if
you
needed
it
so
will
you
be
still
i
said
furiously
mr
harbison
left
that
watch
with
me
an
hour
ago
get
him
and
he
will
tell
you
so
himself
of
course
he
would
flannigan
conceded
looking
at
me
with
grudging
approval
he
wouldn
t
be
what
i
think
he
is
if
he
didn
t
lie
up
and
down
for
there
were
voices
in
the
hall
flannigan
came
closer
an
hour
ago
you
say
and
he
told
me
it
was
gone
this
morning
it
s
a
losing
game
miss
i
ll
give
you
hours
and
then
the
necklace
if
you
please
chapter
xvii
a
clash
and
a
kiss
the
clash
that
came
that
evening
had
been
threatening
for
some
time
take
an
immovable
body
represented
by
harbison
and
his
square
jaw
and
an
irresistible
force
jimmy
and
his
weight
and
there
is
bound
to
be
trouble
the
real
fault
was
jim
s
he
had
gone
entirely
mad
again
over
bella
and
thrown
prudence
to
the
winds
he
mooned
at
her
across
the
dinner
table
and
waylaid
her
on
the
stairs
or
in
the
back
halls
just
to
hear
her
voice
when
she
ordered
him
out
of
her
way
he
telephoned
for
flowers
and
candy
for
her
quite
shamelessly
and
he
got
out
a
book
of
photographs
that
they
had
taken
on
their
wedding
journey
and
kept
it
on
the
library
table
the
sole
concession
he
made
to
our
presumptive
relationship
was
to
bring
me
the
responsibility
for
everything
that
went
wrong
and
his
shirts
for
buttons
the
first
i
heard
of
the
trouble
was
from
dal
he
waylaid
me
in
the
hall
after
dinner
that
night
and
his
face
was
serious
i
m
afraid
we
can
t
keep
it
up
very
long
kit
he
said
with
jim
trailing
bella
all
over
the
house
and
the
old
lady
keener
every
day
it
s
bound
to
come
out
somehow
and
that
isn
t
all
jim
and
harbison
had
a
today
about
about
me
i
repeated
oh
i
dare
say
i
have
been
falling
short
again
what
was
jim
doing
abusing
me
dal
looked
cautiously
over
his
shoulder
but
no
one
was
near
it
seems
that
the
gentle
bella
has
been
unusually
beastly
today
to
jim
and
i
believe
she
s
jealous
of
you
kit
jim
followed
her
up
to
the
roof
before
dinner
with
a
box
of
flowers
and
she
tossed
them
over
the
parapet
she
said
i
believe
that
she
didn
t
want
his
flowers
he
could
buy
them
for
you
and
be
damned
to
him
or
some
jim
is
a
jellyfish
i
said
contemptuously
what
did
he
say
he
said
he
only
cared
for
one
woman
and
that
was
bella
that
he
never
had
really
cared
for
you
and
never
would
and
that
divorce
courts
were
not
unmitigated
evils
if
they
showed
people
the
way
to
real
happiness
which
wouldn
t
amount
to
anything
if
harbison
had
not
been
in
the
tent
trying
to
sleep
dal
did
not
know
all
the
particulars
but
it
seems
that
relations
between
jim
and
harbison
were
rather
strained
bella
had
left
the
roof
and
jim
and
the
harbison
man
came
face
to
face
in
the
door
of
the
tent
according
to
dal
little
had
been
said
but
jim
bound
by
his
promise
to
me
could
not
explain
and
could
only
stammer
something
about
being
an
old
friend
of
miss
knowles
and
tom
had
replied
shortly
that
it
was
none
of
his
business
but
that
there
were
some
things
friendship
hardly
justified
and
tried
to
pass
jim
jim
was
instantly
enraged
he
blocked
the
door
to
the
roof
and
demanded
to
know
what
the
other
man
meant
there
were
two
or
three
versions
of
the
answer
he
got
the
general
purport
was
that
harbison
had
no
desire
to
explain
further
and
that
the
situation
was
forced
on
him
but
if
he
insisted
when
a
man
systematically
ignored
and
neglected
his
wife
for
some
one
else
there
were
communities
where
he
would
be
tarred
and
feathered
meaning
me
jim
demanded
apoplectic
the
remark
was
a
general
one
harbison
retorted
but
if
you
wish
to
make
a
concrete
application
dal
had
gone
up
just
then
and
found
them
glaring
at
each
other
jim
with
his
hands
clenched
at
his
sides
and
harbison
with
his
arms
folded
and
very
erect
dal
took
jim
by
the
elbow
and
led
him
downstairs
muttering
and
the
situation
was
saved
for
the
time
but
dal
was
not
optimistic
you
can
do
a
bit
yourself
kit
he
finished
look
more
cheerful
flirt
a
little
you
can
do
that
without
trying
take
max
on
for
a
day
or
so
it
would
be
charity
anyhow
but
don
t
let
tom
harbison
take
into
his
head
that
you
are
grieving
over
jim
s
neglect
or
he
s
likely
to
toss
him
off
the
i
have
no
reason
to
think
that
harbison
cares
one
way
or
the
other
about
me
i
said
primly
you
don
t
think
he
s
he
s
in
love
with
me
do
you
dal
i
watched
him
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
but
he
only
looked
amused
in
love
with
you
he
repeated
why
bless
your
wicked
little
heart
no
he
thinks
you
re
a
married
woman
it
s
the
principle
of
the
thing
he
s
fighting
for
if
i
had
as
much
principle
as
he
has
i
d
i
d
put
it
out
at
max
interrupted
us
just
then
and
asked
if
we
knew
where
harbison
was
can
t
find
him
he
said
i
ve
got
the
telephone
together
and
have
enough
left
over
to
make
another
where
do
you
suppose
harbison
hides
the
tools
i
m
working
with
a
corkscrew
and
two
palette
i
heard
nothing
more
of
the
trouble
that
night
max
went
to
jim
about
it
and
jim
said
angrily
that
only
a
fool
would
interfere
between
a
man
and
his
wife
wives
whereupon
max
retorted
that
a
fool
and
his
wives
were
soon
parted
and
left
him
the
two
principals
were
coldly
civil
to
each
other
and
smaller
issues
were
lost
as
the
famine
grew
more
and
more
insistent
for
famine
it
was
they
worked
the
rest
of
the
evening
but
the
telephone
refused
to
revive
and
every
one
was
starving
individually
our
pride
was
at
low
ebb
but
collectively
it
was
still
formidable
so
we
sat
around
and
jim
played
grieg
with
the
soft
stops
on
and
aunt
selina
went
to
bed
the
weather
had
changed
and
it
was
sleeting
but
anything
was
better
than
the
drawing
room
i
was
in
a
mood
to
battle
with
the
elements
or
to
cry
or
both
so
i
slipped
out
while
dal
was
reciting
give
me
three
grains
of
corn
mother
threw
somebody
s
overcoat
over
my
shoulders
put
on
a
man
s
soft
hat
jim
s
i
think
and
went
up
to
the
roof
it
was
dark
in
the
third
floor
hall
and
i
had
to
feel
my
way
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
i
went
up
quietly
and
turned
the
knob
of
the
door
to
the
roof
at
first
it
would
not
open
and
i
could
hear
the
wind
howling
outside
finally
however
i
got
the
door
open
a
little
and
wormed
my
way
through
it
was
not
entirely
dark
out
there
in
spite
of
the
storm
a
faint
reflection
of
the
street
lights
made
it
possible
to
distinguish
the
outlines
of
the
boxwood
plants
swaying
in
the
wind
and
the
chimneys
and
the
tent
and
then
a
dark
figure
disentangled
itself
from
the
nearest
chimney
and
seemed
to
hurl
itself
at
me
i
remember
putting
out
my
hands
and
trying
to
say
something
but
the
figure
caught
me
roughly
by
the
shoulders
and
knocked
me
back
against
the
door
frame
from
miles
away
a
heavy
voice
was
saying
so
i
ve
got
you
and
then
the
roof
gave
from
under
me
and
i
was
floating
out
on
the
storm
and
sleet
was
beating
in
my
face
and
the
wind
was
whispering
over
and
over
open
your
eyes
for
god
s
sake
i
did
open
them
after
a
while
and
finally
i
made
out
that
i
was
laying
on
the
floor
in
the
tent
the
lights
were
on
and
i
had
a
cold
and
damp
feeling
and
something
wet
was
trickling
down
my
neck
i
seemed
to
be
alone
but
in
a
second
somebody
came
into
the
tent
and
i
saw
it
was
harbison
and
that
he
had
a
double
handful
of
snow
he
looked
frantic
and
determined
and
only
my
sitting
up
quickly
prevented
my
getting
another
snow
bath
my
neck
felt
queer
and
stiff
and
i
was
very
dizzy
when
he
saw
that
i
was
conscious
he
dropped
the
snow
and
stood
looking
down
at
me
do
you
know
he
said
grimly
that
i
very
nearly
choked
you
to
death
a
little
while
ago
it
wouldn
t
surprise
me
to
be
told
so
i
said
do
i
know
too
much
or
what
is
it
harbison
i
felt
terribly
ill
but
i
would
not
let
him
see
it
it
is
queer
isn
t
it
how
we
always
select
the
roof
for
our
little
differences
he
seemed
to
relax
somewhat
at
my
gibe
i
didn
t
know
it
was
you
he
explained
shortly
i
was
waiting
for
some
one
and
in
the
hat
you
wore
and
the
coat
i
mistook
you
that
s
all
can
you
stand
no
i
retorted
i
could
but
his
summary
manner
displeased
me
the
sequel
however
was
rather
amazing
for
he
stooped
suddenly
and
picked
me
up
and
the
next
instant
we
were
out
in
the
storm
together
at
the
door
he
stooped
and
felt
for
the
knob
turn
it
he
commanded
i
can
t
reach
i
ll
do
nothing
of
the
kind
i
said
shrewishly
let
me
down
i
can
walk
perfectly
he
hesitated
then
he
slid
me
slowly
to
my
feet
but
he
did
not
open
the
door
at
once
are
you
afraid
to
let
me
carry
you
down
those
stairs
after
tuesday
night
he
asked
very
low
you
still
think
i
did
that
i
had
never
been
less
sure
of
it
than
at
that
moment
but
an
imp
of
perversity
made
me
retort
he
hardly
seemed
to
hear
me
he
stood
looking
down
at
me
as
i
leaned
against
the
door
frame
good
lord
he
groaned
to
think
that
i
might
have
killed
you
and
then
he
stooped
and
suddenly
kissed
me
the
next
moment
the
door
was
open
and
he
was
leading
me
down
into
the
house
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
he
paused
still
holding
my
hand
and
faced
me
in
the
darkness
i
m
not
sorry
he
said
steadily
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
but
i
m
not
only
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
was
not
guilty
before
i
didn
t
intend
to
now
i
am
almost
as
much
surprised
as
you
i
was
quite
unable
to
speak
but
i
wrenched
my
hand
loose
he
stepped
back
to
let
me
pass
and
i
went
down
the
hall
alone
chapter
xviii
it
s
all
my
fault
i
didn
t
go
to
the
drawing
room
again
i
went
into
my
own
room
and
sat
in
the
dark
and
tried
to
be
furiously
angry
and
only
succeeded
in
feeling
queer
and
tingly
one
thing
was
absolutely
certain
not
the
same
man
but
two
different
men
had
kissed
me
on
the
stairs
to
the
roof
it
sounds
rather
horrid
and
discriminating
but
there
was
all
the
difference
in
the
world
but
then
who
had
and
for
whom
had
harbison
been
waiting
on
the
roof
did
you
know
that
i
nearly
choked
you
to
death
a
few
minutes
ago
then
he
rather
expected
to
finish
somebody
in
that
way
who
jim
probably
it
was
strange
too
but
suddenly
i
realized
that
no
matter
how
many
suspicious
things
i
mustered
up
against
him
and
there
were
plenty
down
in
my
heart
i
didn
t
believe
him
guilty
of
anything
except
this
last
and
unforgivable
offense
whoever
was
trying
to
leave
the
house
had
taken
the
necklace
that
seemed
clear
unless
max
was
still
foolishly
trying
to
break
quarantine
and
create
one
of
the
sensations
he
so
dearly
loves
this
was
a
new
idea
and
some
things
upheld
it
but
max
had
been
playing
bridge
when
i
was
kissed
on
the
stairs
and
there
was
still
left
that
ridiculous
incident
of
the
comfort
bella
came
up
after
i
had
gone
to
bed
and
turned
on
the
light
to
brush
her
hair
if
i
don
t
leave
this
mausoleum
soon
i
ll
be
carried
out
she
declared
you
in
bed
lollie
mercer
and
dal

anne
hysterical
and
jim
making
his
will
in
the
den
you

m
all
if

some
parley
you

a
bella

back
from
the
door
look

know
jim
pretty
well
don
t
you
think
he
looks
ill
thinner
he
s
a
wreck
i
said
soberly

a
lot
to
answer
for
bella
went
over
to
the
cheval
glass
and
looked
in
it
i
avoid
him
all
i
can
she
said
posing
he
s
awfully
funny
he
s
so
afraid
i
ll
think
he
s
serious
about
you
he
can
t
realize
that
for
me
he
simply
doesn
t
well
i
took
aunt
selina
and
about
two
o
clock
while
i
was
in
my
first
sleep
i
woke
to
find
her
standing
beside
me
tugging
at
my
arm
there
s
somebody
in
the
house
she
whispered
thieves
if
they
re
in
they
ll
not
get
out
tonight
i
said
i
tell
you
i
saw
a
man
skulking
on
the
stairs
she
insisted
i
got
up
ungraciously
enough
and
put
on
my
dressing
gown
aunt
selina
who
had
her
hair
in
crimps
tied
a
veil
over
her
head
and
together
we
went
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
aunt
selina
leaned
far
over
and
peered
down
he
s
in
the
library
she
whispered
i
can
see
a
the
lust
of
battle
was
in
aunt
selina
s
eye
she
girded
her
robe
about
her
and
began
to
descend
the
stairs
cautiously
we
went
through
the
hall
and
stopped
at
the
library
door
it
was
empty
but
from
the
den
beyond
came
a
hum
of
voices
and
the
cheerful
glow
of
fire
light
i
realized
the
situation
then
but
it
was
too
late
then
why
did
you
kiss
her
in
the
dining
room
bella
was
saying
in
her
clear
high
tones
you
did
didn
t
you
it
was
only
her
hand
jim
desperately
explaining
i
ve
got
to
pay
her
some
attention
under
the
circumstances
and
i
give
you
my
word
i
was
thinking
of
you
when
i
did
the
wretch
aunt
selina
drew
her
breath
in
suddenly
i
am
thinking
of
marrying
reggie
this
was
bella
of
course
he
wants
me
to
he
s
a
dear
if
you
do
i
will
kill
i
am
so
very
lonely
bella
sighed
we
could
hear
the
creak
of
jim
s
shirt
bosom
that
showed
that
he
had
sighed
also
aunt
selina
had
gripped
me
by
the
arm
and
i
could
hear
her
breathing
hard
beside
me
it
s
only
jim
i
whispered
i
i
don
t
want
to
hear
any
but
she
clutched
me
firmly
and
the
next
thing
we
heard
was
another
creak
louder
and
get
up
get
up
off
your
knees
this
instant
bella
was
saying
frantically
some
one
might
come
don
t
send
me
away
jim
said
in
a
smothered
voice
every
one
in
the
house
is
asleep
and
i
love
you
aunt
selina
swallowed
hard
in
the
darkness
you
have
no
right
to
make
love
to
me
bella
it
s
it
s
highly
improper
under
the
and
then
jim
you
swallow
a
camel
and
stick
at
a
gnat
why
did
you
meet
me
here
if
you
didn
t
expect
me
to
make
love
to
you
i
ve
stood
for
a
lot
bella
but
this
foolishness
will
have
to
end
either
you
love
me
or
you
don
t
i
m
he
drew
a
long
forlorn
breath
poor
old
jim
this
was
bella
a
pause
then
let
my
hand
alone
also
bella
it
is
my
hand
jim
s
most
fatuous
tone
there
is
where
you
wore
my
ring
there
s
the
mark
sounds
of
jim
kissing
bella
s
ring
finger
what
did
you
do
with
it
throw
it
away
more
sounds
aunt
selina
crossed
the
library
swiftly
and
again
i
followed
bella
was
sitting
in
a
low
chair
by
the
fire
looking
at
the
logs
in
the
most
exquisite
negligee
of
pink
chiffon
and
ribbon
jim
was
on
his
knees
staring
at
her
adoringly
and
holding
both
her
hands
i
ll
tell
you
a
secret
bella
was
saying
looking
as
coy
as
she
knew
how
which
was
considerable
i
i
still
wear
it
on
a
chain
around
my
on
a
chain
around
her
neck
bella
who
is
decollete
whenever
it
is
allowable
and
more
than
is
proper
that
was
the
limit
of
aunt
selina
s
endurance
still
holding
me
she
stepped
through
the
doorway
and
into
the
firelight
a
fearful
figure
jim
saw
her
first
he
went
quite
white
and
struggled
to
get
up
smiling
a
sickly
smile
bella
after
her
first
surprise
was
superbly
indifferent
she
glanced
at
us
raised
her
eyebrows
and
then
looked
at
the
clock
more
victims
of
insomnia
she
said
won
t
you
come
in
jim
pull
up
a
chair
by
the
fire
for
your
aunt
selina
opened
her
mouth
twice
like
a
fish
before
she
could
speak
then
james
i
demand
that
that
woman
leave
the
house
she
said
hoarsely
bella
leaned
back
and
yawned
james
shall
i
go
she
asked
amiably
nonsense
jim
said
pulling
himself
together
as
best
he
could
look
here
aunt
selina
you
know
she
can
t
go
out
and
what
s
more
i
don
t
want
her
to
you
what
aunt
selina
screeched
taking
a
step
forward
you
have
the
audacity
to
say
such
a
thing
to
me
bella
leaned
over
and
gave
the
fire
log
a
punch
i
was
just
saying
that
he
shouldn
t
say
such
things
to
me
either
she
remarked
pleasantly
i
m
afraid
you
ll
take
cold
miss
caruthers
wouldn
t
you
like
a
hot
sherry
flip
aunt
selina
gasped
then
she
sat
down
heavily
on
one
of
the
carved
teakwood
chairs
he
said
he
loved
you
i
heard
him
she
said
weakly
he
he
was
going
to
put
his
arm
around
you
habit
jim
put
in
trying
to
smile
you
see
aunt
selina
it
s
well
it
s
a
habit
i
got
into
some
time
ago
and
i
my
arm
does
it
without
my
thinking
about
habit
aunt
selina
repeated
her
voice
thick
with
passion
then
she
turned
to
me
go
to
your
room
at
once
she
said
in
her
most
awful
tone
go
to
your
room
and
leave
this
this
shocking
affair
to
but
if
she
had
reached
her
limit
so
had
i
if
jim
chose
to
ruin
himself
it
was
not
my
fault
any
one
with
common
sense
would
have
known
at
least
to
close
the
door
before
he
went
down
on
his
knees
no
matter
to
whom
so
when
aunt
selina
turned
on
me
and
pointed
in
the
direction
of
the
staircase
i
did
not
move
i
am
perfectly
wide
awake
i
said
coldly
i
shall
go
to
bed
when
i
am
entirely
ready
and
not
before
and
as
for
jim
s
conduct
i
do
not
know
much
about
the
conventions
in
such
cases
but
if
he
wishes
to
embrace
miss
knowles
and
she
wants
him
to
the
situation
is
interesting
but
hardly
aunt
selina
rose
slowly
and
drew
the
folds
of
her
dressing
gown
around
her
away
from
the
contamination
of
my
touch
do
you
know
what
you
are
saying
she
demanded
hoarsely
i
i
was
quite
white
and
stiff
from
my
knees
up
but
below
i
was
wavery
i
glanced
at
jim
for
moral
support
but
he
was
looking
idolatrously
at
bella
as
for
her
quite
suddenly
she
had
dropped
her
mask
of
indifference
her
face
was
strained
and
anxious
and
there
were
deep
circles
i
had
not
seen
before
under
her
eyes
and
it
was
bella
who
finally
threw
herself
into
the
breach
the
family
breach
it
is
all
my
fault
miss
caruthers
she
said
stepping
between
aunt
selina
and
myself
i
have
been
a
blind
and
wicked
woman
and
i
have
almost
wrecked
two
two
what
of
mine
you
see
she
struggled
on
against
the
glint
in
aunt
selina
s
eyes
i
i
did
not
realize
how
much
i
cared
until
it
was
too
late
i
did
so
many
things
that
were
cruel
and
wrong
oh
jim
jim
she
turned
and
buried
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
cried
real
tears
i
could
hardly
believe
that
it
was
bella
and
jim
put
both
his
arms
around
her
and
almost
cried
too
and
looked
nauseatingly
happy
with
the
eye
he
turned
to
bella
and
scared
to
death
out
of
the
one
he
kept
on
aunt
selina
she
turned
on
me
as
of
course
i
knew
she
would
that
she
said
pointing
at
jim
and
bella
that
shameful
picture
is
due
to
your
own
indifference
i
am
not
blind
i
have
seen
how
you
rejected
all
his
loving
bella
drew
away
from
jim
but
he
jerked
her
back
if
anything
in
the
world
would
reconcile
me
to
divorce
it
is
this
unbelievable
situation
james
are
you
shameless
but
james
was
and
didn
t
care
who
knew
it
and
as
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
and
no
one
else
to
do
it
i
stood
very
straight
against
the
door
frame
and
told
the
whole
miserable
story
from
the
very
beginning
i
told
how
dal
and
jim
had
persuaded
me
and
how
i
had
weakened
and
found
it
was
too
late
and
how
bella
had
come
in
that
night
when
she
had
no
business
to
come
and
had
sat
down
in
the
basement
kitchen
on
my
hands
and
almost
turned
me
into
a
raving
maniac
as
i
went
on
i
became
fluent
my
sense
of
injury
grew
on
me
i
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
i
hated
them
all
and
that
when
people
got
divorces
they
ought
to
know
their
own
minds
and
stay
divorced
and
at
that
a
great
light
broke
on
aunt
selina
who
hadn
t
understood
until
that
minute
in
view
of
her
principles
she
might
have
been
expected
to
turn
on
jim
and
bella
and
disinherit
them
and
cast
them
out
figuratively
with
the
flaming
sword
of
her
tongue
but
she
did
not
she
turned
on
me
in
the
most
terrible
way
and
asked
me
how
i
dared
to
come
between
husband
and
wife
because
divorce
or
no
divorce
whom
god
hath
joined
together
and
so
on
and
when
jim
picked
up
his
courage
in
both
hands
and
tried
to
interfere
she
pushed
him
back
with
one
hand
while
she
pointed
the
other
at
me
and
called
me
a
jezebel
chapter
xix
the
harbison
man
she
talked
for
an
hour
having
got
between
me
and
the
door
and
she
scolded
jim
and
bella
thoroughly
but
they
did
not
hear
it
being
occupied
with
each
other
sitting
side
by
side
meekly
on
the
divan
with
jim
holding
bella
s
hand
under
a
cushion
she
said
they
would
have
to
be
very
good
to
make
up
for
all
the
deception
but
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
it
was
a
relief
to
her
to
find
that
i
didn
t
belong
to
her
permanently
and
as
i
have
said
before
she
was
crazy
about
bella
i
sat
back
in
a
chair
and
grew
comfortably
drowsy
in
the
monotony
of
her
voice
it
was
a
name
that
brought
me
to
myself
with
a
jerk
mr
harbison
aunt
selina
was
saying
then
bring
him
down
at
once
james
i
want
no
more
deception
there
is
no
use
cleaning
a
house
and
leaving
a
dirty
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
me
to
stay
and
see
it
swept
i
said
mustering
the
rags
she
had
left
of
my
and
trying
to
pass
her
but
she
planted
herself
squarely
before
me
you
can
not
stir
up
a
dust
like
this
young
woman
and
leave
other
people
to
sneeze
in
it
she
said
grimly
and
i
stayed
i
sat
very
small
on
a
chair
in
a
corner
i
felt
like
jezebel
or
whatever
her
name
was
and
now
the
harbison
man
was
coming
and
he
was
going
to
see
me
stripped
of
my
pretensions
to
domesticity
and
of
a
husband
who
neglected
me
he
was
going
to
see
me
branded
a
living
lie
and
he
would
hate
me
because
i
had
put
him
in
a
ridiculous
position
he
was
just
the
sort
to
resent
being
ridiculous
jim
brought
him
down
in
a
dressing
gown
and
a
state
of
bewilderment
it
was
plain
that
the
memory
of
the
afternoon
still
rankled
for
he
was
very
short
with
jim
and
inclined
to
resent
the
whole
thing
the
clock
in
the
hall
chimed
half
after
three
as
they
came
down
the
stairs
and
i
heard
harbison
stumble
over
something
in
the
darkness
and
say
that
if
it
was
a
joke
he
wasn
t
in
the
humor
for
it
to
which
jim
retorted
that
it
wasn
t
anything
resembling
a
joke
and
for
heaven
s
sake
not
to
walk
on
his
feet
he
couldn
t
get
around
the
furniture
any
faster
at
the
door
of
the
den
harbison
stopped
blinking
in
the
light
then
when
he
saw
us
he
tried
to
back
himself
and
his
dishabille
out
into
the
obscurity
of
the
library
but
aunt
selina
was
too
quick
for
him
come
in
she
called
i
want
you
young
man
it
seems
that
there
are
only
two
fools
in
the
house
and
you
are
he
straightened
at
that
and
looked
bewildered
but
he
tried
to
smile
i
thought
i
was
the
only
one
he
said
is
it
possible
that
there
is
another
i
am
the
other
she
announced
i
think
she
expected
him
to
say
impossible
but
whatever
he
was
he
was
never
banal
is
that
so
he
asked
politely
trying
to
be
interested
and
to
understand
at
the
same
time
he
had
not
seen
me
he
was
gazing
fixedly
at
bella
languishing
on
the
divan
and
watching
him
with
lowered
lids
and
he
had
given
jim
a
side
glance
of
contempt
but
now
he
saw
me
and
he
colored
under
his
tan
his
neck
blushed
furiously
being
much
whiter
than
his
face
he
kept
his
eyes
on
mine
and
i
knew
that
he
was
mutely
asking
forgiveness
but
the
thought
of
what
was
coming
paralyzed
me
my
eyes
were
glued
to
his
as
they
had
been
that
first
evening
when
he
had
called
me
mrs
wilson
and
after
an
instant
he
looked
away
and
his
face
was
set
and
hard
it
seems
that
we
have
all
been
playing
a
little
comedy
harbison
aunt
selina
began
nasally
sarcastic
or
rather
you
and
i
have
been
the
audience
the
rest
have
i
i
don
t
think
i
understand
he
said
slowly
i
have
seen
very
little
it
was
not
well
planned
aunt
selina
retorted
tartly
the
idea
was
good
but
the
young
person
who
was
playing
the
part
of
wilson
oh
come
aunt
selina
jim
protested
kit
was
coaxed
and
cajoled
into
this
thing
give
me
fits
if
you
like
i
deserve
all
i
get
but
let
kit
alone
she
did
it
for
bella
looked
over
at
me
and
smiled
nastily
i
would
stop
doing
things
for
jim
kit
she
said
it
is
so
but
harbison
harked
back
to
aunt
selina
s
speech
playing
the
part
of
wilson
he
repeated
do
you
mean
exactly
playing
the
part
she
is
not
wilson
it
seems
that
that
honor
belonged
at
one
time
to
miss
knowles
i
believe
such
things
are
not
unknown
in
new
york
only
why
in
the
name
of
sense
does
a
man
want
to
divorce
a
woman
and
then
meet
her
at
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
to
kiss
the
place
where
his
own
wedding
ring
used
to
rest
jim
fidgeted
bella
was
having
spasms
of
mirth
to
herself
but
the
harbison
man
did
not
smile
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
the
fire
then
he
thrust
his
hands
deep
into
the
pockets
of
his
dressing
gown
and
stalked
over
to
me
he
did
not
care
that
the
others
were
watching
and
listening
is
it
true
he
demanded
staring
down
at
me
you
are
not
wilson
you
are
not
married
at
all
all
that
about
being
neglected
and
loathing
him
and
all
that
on
the
roof
there
was
no
foundation
of
truth
i
could
only
shake
my
head
without
looking
up
there
was
no
defense
to
be
made
oh
i
deserved
the
scorn
in
his
voice
they
they
persuaded
you
i
suppose
and
it
was
to
help
somebody
it
was
not
a
practical
joke
no
i
rallied
a
little
spirit
at
that
it
had
been
anything
but
a
joke
he
drew
a
long
breath
i
think
i
understand
he
said
slowly
but
you
could
have
saved
me
something
i
must
have
given
you
all
a
great
deal
of
oh
no
i
protested
i
i
want
to
tell
you
but
he
deliberately
left
me
and
went
over
to
the
door
there
he
turned
and
looked
down
at
aunt
selina
he
was
a
little
white
but
there
was
no
passion
in
his
face
thank
you
for
telling
me
all
this
miss
caruthers
he
said
easily
now
that
you
and
i
know
i
m
afraid
the
others
will
miss
their
little
diversion
good
oh
it
was
all
right
for
jim
to
laugh
and
say
that
he
was
only
huffed
a
little
and
would
be
over
it
by
morning
i
knew
better
there
was
something
queer
in
his
face
as
he
went
out
he
did
not
even
glance
in
my
direction
he
had
said
very
little
but
he
had
put
me
as
effectually
in
the
wrong
as
if
he
had
not
kissed
me
deliberately
kissed
me
that
very
evening
on
the
roof
i
did
not
go
to
sleep
again
i
lay
wretchedly
thinking
things
over
and
trying
to
remember
who
jezebel
was
and
toward
morning
i
distinctly
heard
the
knob
of
the
door
turn
i
mistrusted
my
ears
however
and
so
i
got
up
quietly
and
went
over
in
the
darkness
there
was
no
sound
outside
but
when
i
put
my
hand
on
the
knob
i
felt
it
move
under
my
fingers
the
counter
pressure
evidently
alarmed
whoever
it
was
for
the
knob
was
released
and
nothing
more
happened
but
by
this
time
anything
so
uncomplicated
as
the
fumbling
of
a
knob
at
night
had
no
power
to
disturb
me
i
went
back
to
bed
chapter
xx
breaking
out
in
a
new
place
hunger
roused
everybody
early
the
next
morning
friday
leila
mercer
had
discovered
a
box
of
bonbons
that
she
had
forgotten
and
we
divided
them
around
aunt
selina
asked
for
the
candied
fruit
and
got
it
quite
a
third
of
the
box
we
gathered
in
the
lower
hall
and
on
the
stairs
and
nibbled
nauseating
sweets
while
harbison
examined
the
telephone
he
did
not
glance
in
my
direction
betty
and
dal
were
helping
him
and
he
seemed
very
cheerful
max
sat
with
me
on
the
stairs
harbison
had
just
unscrewed
the
telephone
box
from
the
wall
and
was
squinting
into
it
when
bella
came
downstairs
it
was
her
first
appearance
but
as
she
was
always
late
nobody
noticed
when
she
stopped
just
above
us
on
the
stairs
however
we
looked
up
and
she
was
holding
to
the
rail
and
trembling
perceptibly
mr
harbison
will
you
can
you
come
upstairs
she
asked
her
voice
was
strained
almost
reedy
and
her
lips
were
white
harbison
stared
up
at
her
with
the
telephone
box
in
his
hands
why
er
certainly
he
said
but
unless
it
s
very
important
i
d
like
to
fix
this
talking
machine
we
want
to
make
a
food
i
d
like
to
break
a
food
record
max
put
in
but
bella
created
a
diversion
by
sitting
down
suddenly
on
the
stair
just
above
us
and
burying
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
jim
is
sick
she
said
with
a
sob
he
he
doesn
t
want
anything
to
eat
and
his
head
aches
he
said
for
me
to
go
away
and
let
him
die
dal
dropped
the
hammer
immediately
and
lollie
mercer
sat
petrified
with
a
bonbon
halfway
to
her
mouth
for
of
course
it
was
unexpected
finding
sentiment
of
any
kind
in
bella
and
none
of
them
knew
about
the
scene
in
the
den
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
sick
aunt
selina
said
from
a
hall
chair
sick
where
all
over
bella
quavered
his
poor
head
is
hot
and
he
s
thirsty
but
he
doesn
t
want
anything
but
great
scott
dal
said
suddenly
suppose
he
should
bella
are
you
telling
us
all
his
symptoms
bella
put
down
her
handkerchief
and
got
up
from
her
position
on
the
stairs
she
looked
down
on
us
with
something
of
her
old
haughty
manner
if
he
is
ill
you
may
blame
yourselves
all
of
you
she
said
cruelly
you
taunted
him
with
being
fat
and
laughed
at
him
until
he
stopped
eating
the
things
he
should
eat
and
he
has
been
exercising
on
the
roof
until
he
has
worn
himself
out
and
now
he
is
ill
he
he
has
a
everybody
jumped
at
that
and
we
instinctively
moved
away
from
bella
she
was
quite
cold
and
scornful
by
that
time
a
rash
max
exclaimed
what
sort
of
rash
i
did
not
see
it
bella
said
with
dignity
and
turning
she
went
up
the
stairs
there
was
a
great
deal
of
excitement
and
nobody
except
harbison
was
willing
to
go
near
jim
he
went
up
at
once
with
bella
while
max
and
dal
sat
cravenly
downstairs
and
wondered
if
we
would
all
take
it
and
anne
told
about
a
man
she
knew
who
had
it
and
was
deaf
and
dumb
and
blind
when
he
recovered
harbison
came
down
after
a
while
and
said
that
the
rash
was
there
right
enough
and
that
jim
absolutely
refused
to
be
quarantined
that
he
insisted
that
he
always
got
a
rash
from
early
strawberries
and
that
if
he
did
have
anything
since
they
were
so
touchy
he
hoped
they
would
all
get
it
if
they
locked
him
in
he
would
kick
the
door
down
we
had
a
long
conference
in
the
hall
with
bella
sitting
and
objecting
to
every
suggestion
we
made
and
finally
we
arranged
to
shut
jim
up
in
one
of
the
servants
bedrooms
with
a
sheet
wrung
out
of
disinfectant
hung
over
the
door
bella
said
she
would
sit
outside
in
the
hall
and
read
to
him
through
the
closed
door
so
finally
he
gave
a
grudging
consent
but
he
was
in
an
awful
humor
max
and
dal
put
on
rubber
gloves
and
helped
him
over
and
they
said
afterward
that
the
way
he
talked
was
fearful
and
there
was
a
telephone
in
the
maid
s
room
and
he
kept
asking
for
things
every
five
minutes
when
the
doctor
came
he
said
it
was
too
early
to
tell
positively
and
he
ordered
him
liquid
diet
and
said
he
would
be
back
that
evening
which
the
diet
takes
me
back
to
the
famine
after
they
had
moved
jim
harbison
went
back
to
the
telephone
and
found
everything
as
it
should
be
so
he
followed
the
telephone
wire
and
the
rest
followed
him
i
did
not
he
had
systematically
ignored
me
all
morning
after
having
dared
to
kiss
me
the
night
before
and
any
other
man
i
know
after
looking
at
me
the
way
he
had
looked
a
dozen
times
would
have
been
at
least
reasonably
glad
to
find
me
free
and
unmarried
but
it
was
clear
that
he
was
not
i
wondered
if
he
was
the
kind
of
man
who
always
makes
love
to
the
other
man
s
wife
and
runs
like
mad
when
she
is
left
a
widow
or
gets
a
divorce
and
just
when
i
had
decided
that
i
hated
him
and
that
there
was
one
man
i
knew
who
would
never
make
love
to
a
woman
whom
he
thought
married
and
then
be
very
dignified
and
aloof
when
he
found
she
wasn
t
i
heard
what
was
wrong
with
the
telephone
wire
it
had
been
cut
cut
through
with
a
pair
of
silver
manicure
scissors
from
the
dressing
table
in
bella
s
room
where
aunt
selina
slept
the
wire
had
been
clipped
where
it
came
into
the
house
just
under
a
window
and
the
scissors
still
lay
on
the
sill
it
was
mysterious
enough
but
no
one
was
interested
in
the
mystery
just
then
we
wanted
food
and
wanted
it
at
once
harbison
fixed
the
wire
and
the
first
thing
we
did
of
course
was
to
order
something
to
eat
aunt
selina
went
to
bed
just
after
luncheon
with
indigestion
to
the
relief
of
every
one
in
the
house
she
had
been
most
unpleasant
all
morning
when
she
found
herself
ill
however
she
insisted
on
having
bella
and
that
made
trouble
at
once
we
found
bella
with
her
cheek
against
the
door
into
jim
s
room
looking
maudlin
while
he
shouted
love
messages
to
her
from
the
other
side
at
first
she
refused
to
stir
but
after
anne
and
max
had
tried
and
failed
the
rest
of
us
went
to
her
in
a
body
and
implored
her
we
said
aunt
selina
was
in
awful
shape
which
she
was
as
to
temper
and
that
she
had
thrown
a
mustard
plaster
at
anne
which
was
true
so
bella
went
grumbling
and
jim
was
a
maniac
we
had
not
thought
it
would
be
so
bad
for
bella
but
aunt
selina
fell
asleep
soon
after
she
took
charge
holding
bella
s
hand
and
slept
for
three
hours
and
never
let
go
about
two
that
afternoon
the
sun
came
out
and
the
rest
of
us
went
to
the
roof
the
sleet
had
melted
and
the
air
was
fairly
warm
two
housemaids
dusting
rugs
on
the
top
of
the
next
house
came
over
and
stared
at
us
and
somebody
in
an
automobile
down
on
riverside
drive
stood
up
and
waved
at
us
it
was
very
cheerful
and
hopelessly
lonely
i
stayed
on
the
roof
after
the
others
had
gone
and
for
some
time
i
thought
i
was
alone
after
a
while
i
got
a
whiff
of
smoke
and
then
i
saw
harbison
far
over
in
the
corner
one
foot
on
the
parapet
moodily
smoking
a
pipe
he
was
gazing
out
over
the
river
and
paying
no
attention
to
me
this
was
natural
considering
that
i
had
hardly
spoken
to
him
all
day
i
would
not
let
him
drive
me
away
so
i
sat
still
and
it
grew
darker
and
colder
he
filled
his
pipe
now
and
then
but
he
never
looked
in
my
direction
finally
however
as
it
grew
very
dusk
he
knocked
the
ashes
out
and
came
toward
me
i
am
going
to
make
a
request
miss
mcnair
he
said
evenly
please
keep
off
the
roof
after
sunset
there
are
i
had
risen
and
was
preparing
to
go
downstairs
unless
i
know
the
reasons
i
refuse
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
i
retorted
he
bowed
then
the
door
will
be
kept
locked
he
rejoined
and
opened
it
for
me
he
did
not
follow
me
but
stood
watching
until
i
was
down
and
i
heard
him
close
the
roof
door
firmly
behind
me
chapter
xxi
a
bar
of
soap
late
that
evening
betty
mercer
and
dallas
were
writing
verses
of
condolence
to
be
signed
by
all
of
us
and
put
under
the
door
into
jim
s
room
when
bella
came
running
down
the
stairs
dal
was
reading
the
first
verse
when
she
came
listen
to
this
bella
he
said
triumphantly
there
was
a
fat
artist
named
jas
who
cruelly
called
his
friends
nas
when
altho
shut
up
tight
he
broke
out
over
night
with
a
rash
that
is
maddening
he
then
he
caught
sight
of
bella
s
face
as
she
stood
in
the
doorway
and
stopped
jim
is
delirious
she
announced
tragically
you
shut
him
in
there
all
alone
and
now
he
s
delirious
i
ll
never
forgive
any
of
delirious
everybody
exclaimed
he
was
sane
enough
when
i
took
him
his
chicken
broth
harbison
said
he
was
almost
he
is
stark
staring
crazy
bella
insisted
hysterically
i
i
locked
the
door
carefully
when
i
went
down
to
my
dinner
and
when
i
came
up
it
it
was
unlocked
and
jim
was
babbling
on
the
bed
with
a
sheet
over
his
face
he
he
says
the
house
is
haunted
and
he
wants
all
the
men
to
come
up
and
sit
in
the
room
with
not
on
your
life
max
said
i
am
young
and
my
career
has
only
begun
i
don
t
intend
to
be
cut
off
in
the
flower
of
my
youth
but
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
ll
take
him
a
drink
i
can
tie
it
to
a
pole
or
but
harbison
did
not
smile
he
was
thoughtful
for
a
minute
then
i
don
t
believe
he
is
delirious
he
said
quietly
and
i
wouldn
t
be
surprised
if
he
has
happened
on
something
that
will
be
of
general
interest
i
think
i
will
stay
with
him
after
that
of
course
none
of
the
others
would
confess
that
he
was
afraid
so
with
the
south
american
leading
they
all
went
upstairs
the
women
of
the
party
sat
on
the
lower
steps
and
listened
but
everything
was
quiet
now
and
then
we
could
hear
the
sound
of
voices
and
after
a
while
there
was
a
rapid
slamming
of
doors
and
the
sound
of
some
one
running
down
to
the
second
floor
then
quiet
again
none
of
us
felt
talkative
bella
had
followed
the
men
up
and
had
been
put
out
and
sat
sniffling
by
herself
in
the
den
aunt
selina
was
working
over
a
puzzle
in
the
library
and
declaring
that
some
of
it
must
be
lost
anne
and
leila
mercer
were
embroidering
and
betty
and
i
sat
idle
our
hands
in
our
laps
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
house
was
mysterious
anne
told
over
again
of
the
strange
noises
the
night
her
necklace
was
stolen
betty
asked
me
about
the
time
when
the
comfort
slipped
from
under
my
fingers
and
when
in
the
midst
of
the
story
the
telephone
rang
we
all
jumped
and
shrieked
in
an
hour
or
so
they
sent
for
flannigan
and
he
went
upstairs
he
came
down
again
soon
however
and
returned
with
something
over
his
arm
that
looked
like
a
rope
it
seemed
to
be
made
of
all
kinds
of
things
tied
together
trunk
straps
clothesline
bed
sheets
and
something
that
flannigan
pointed
to
with
rage
and
said
he
hadn
t
been
able
to
keep
his
clothes
on
all
day
he
refused
to
explain
further
however
and
trailed
the
nondescript
article
up
the
stairs
we
could
only
gaze
after
him
and
wonder
what
it
all
meant
the
conclave
lasted
far
into
the
night
the
feminine
contingent
went
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
some
time
after
midnight
harbison
and
max
went
downstairs
and
i
could
hear
them
rattling
around
testing
windows
and
burglar
alarms
but
finally
every
one
settled
down
and
the
rest
of
the
night
was
quiet
betty
mercer
came
into
my
room
the
next
morning
sunday
and
said
anne
brown
wanted
me
i
went
over
at
once
and
anne
was
sitting
up
in
bed
crying
dal
had
slipped
out
of
the
room
at
daylight
she
said
and
hadn
t
come
back
he
had
thought
she
was
asleep
but
she
wasn
t
and
she
knew
he
was
dead
for
nothing
ever
made
dal
get
up
on
sunday
before
noon
there
was
no
one
moving
in
the
house
and
i
hardly
knew
what
to
do
it
was
betty
who
said
she
would
go
up
and
rouse
harbison
and
max
who
had
taken
jim
s
place
in
the
studio
she
started
out
bravely
enough
but
in
a
minute
we
heard
her
flying
back
anne
grew
perfectly
white
he
s
lying
on
the
upper
stairs
betty
cried
and
we
all
ran
out
it
was
quite
true
dal
was
lying
on
the
stairs
in
a
bathrobe
with
one
of
jim
s
indian
war
clubs
in
his
hand
and
he
was
sound
asleep
he
looked
somewhat
embarrassed
when
he
roused
and
saw
us
standing
around
he
said
he
was
going
to
play
a
practical
joke
on
somebody
and
fell
asleep
in
the
middle
of
it
and
anne
said
he
wasn
t
even
an
intelligent
liar
and
went
back
to
bed
in
a
temper
but
betty
came
in
with
me
and
we
sat
and
looked
at
each
other
and
didn
t
say
much
the
situation
was
beyond
us
the
doctor
let
jim
out
the
next
day
there
having
been
nothing
the
matter
with
him
but
a
stomach
rash
but
jim
was
changed
he
mooned
around
bella
of
course
as
before
but
he
was
abstracted
at
times
and
all
that
day
sunday
he
wandered
off
by
himself
and
one
would
come
across
him
unexpectedly
in
the
basement
or
along
some
of
the
unused
back
halls
aunt
selina
held
service
that
morning
jim
said
that
he
always
had
a
prayer
book
but
that
he
couldn
t
find
anything
with
so
many
people
in
the
house
so
aunt
selina
read
some
religious
poetry
out
of
the
newspapers
and
gave
us
a
valuable
talk
on
deception
versus
honesty
with
me
as
the
illustration
almost
everybody
took
a
nap
after
luncheon
i
stayed
in
the
den
and
read
ibsen
and
felt
very
mournful
and
after
hedda
had
shot
herself
i
lay
down
on
the
divan
and
cried
a
little
over
hedda
she
was
young
and
it
was
such
a
tragic
ending
and
then
i
fell
asleep
when
i
wakened
harbison
was
standing
by
the
table
and
he
held
my
book
in
his
hands
in
view
of
the
armed
neutrality
between
us
i
expected
to
see
him
bow
to
me
curtly
turn
on
his
heel
and
leave
the
room
indeed
considering
his
state
of
mind
the
night
before
i
should
hardly
have
been
surprised
if
he
had
thrown
hedda
at
my
head
this
is
not
a
pun
i
detest
them
but
instead
when
he
heard
me
move
he
glanced
over
at
me
and
even
smiled
a
little
she
wasn
t
worth
it
he
said
indicating
the
book
worth
what
your
tears
you
were
crying
over
it
weren
t
you
she
was
very
unhappy
i
asserted
indifferently
she
was
married
and
she
loved
some
one
do
you
really
think
she
did
he
asked
and
even
so
was
that
a
reason
the
other
man
cared
for
her
he
may
not
have
been
able
to
help
but
he
knew
that
she
was
married
he
said
virtuously
and
then
he
caught
my
eye
and
he
saw
the
analogy
instantly
for
he
colored
hotly
and
put
down
the
book
most
men
argue
that
way
i
said
they
argue
by
the
book
and
they
do
as
they
he
picked
up
a
japanese
ivory
paper
weight
from
the
table
and
stood
balancing
it
across
his
finger
you
are
perfectly
right
he
said
at
last
i
deserve
it
all
my
grievance
is
at
myself
your
your
beauty
and
the
fact
that
i
thought
you
were
unhappy
put
me
beside
myself
it
is
not
an
excuse
it
is
a
weak
explanation
i
will
not
forget
myself
he
was
as
abject
as
any
one
could
have
wished
it
was
my
minute
of
triumph
but
i
can
not
pretend
that
i
was
happy
evidently
it
had
been
only
a
passing
impulse
if
he
had
really
cared
now
that
he
knew
i
was
free
he
would
have
forgotten
himself
again
at
once
then
a
new
explanation
occurred
to
me
suppose
it
had
been
bella
all
the
time
and
the
real
shock
had
been
to
find
that
she
had
been
married
the
fault
of
the
situation
was
really
mine
i
said
magnanimously
i
quite
blame
myself
only
you
must
believe
one
thing
you
never
furnished
us
any
i
looked
at
him
sidewise
the
discovery
that
bella
and
jim
were
once
married
must
have
been
a
great
it
was
a
surprise
he
replied
evenly
his
voice
and
his
eyes
were
inscrutable
he
returned
my
glance
steadily
it
was
infuriating
to
have
gone
to
meet
him
as
i
had
and
then
to
find
him
intrenched
in
his
again
i
got
up
it
is
unfortunate
that
our
acquaintance
has
begun
so
unfavorably
i
remarked
preparing
to
pass
him
under
other
circumstances
we
might
have
been
there
is
only
one
solace
he
said
when
we
do
not
have
friends
we
can
not
lose
he
opened
the
door
to
let
me
pass
out
and
as
our
eyes
met
all
the
coldness
died
out
of
his
he
held
out
his
hand
but
i
was
hurt
i
refused
to
see
it
kit
he
said
unsteadily
i
i
m
an
obstinate
brute
i
am
sorry
can
t
we
be
friends
after
all
when
we
do
not
have
friends
we
can
not
lose
them
i
replied
with
cool
malice
and
the
next
instant
the
door
closed
behind
me
it
was
that
night
that
the
really
serious
event
of
the
quarantine
occurred
we
were
gathered
in
the
library
and
everybody
was
deadly
dull
aunt
selina
said
she
had
been
reared
to
a
strict
observance
of
the
sabbath
and
she
refused
to
go
to
bed
early
the
cards
and
card
tables
were
put
away
and
every
one
sat
around
and
quarreled
and
was
generally
nasty
except
bella
and
jim
who
had
gone
into
the
den
just
after
dinner
and
firmly
closed
the
door
i
think
it
was
just
after
max
proposed
to
me
yes
he
proposed
to
me
again
that
night
he
said
that
jim
s
illness
had
decided
him
that
any
of
us
might
take
sick
and
die
shut
in
that
contaminated
atmosphere
and
that
if
he
did
he
wanted
it
all
settled
and
whether
i
took
him
or
not
he
wanted
me
to
remember
him
kindly
if
anything
happened
i
really
hated
to
refuse
him
he
was
in
such
deadly
earnest
but
it
was
quite
unnecessary
for
him
to
have
blamed
his
refusal
as
he
did
on
harbison
i
am
sure
i
had
refused
him
plenty
of
times
before
i
had
ever
heard
of
the
man
yes
it
was
just
after
he
proposed
to
me
that
flannigan
came
to
the
door
and
called
harbison
out
into
the
hall
flannigan
like
most
of
the
people
in
the
house
always
went
to
harbison
when
there
was
anything
to
be
done
he
openly
adored
him
and
what
was
more
he
did
what
harbison
ordered
without
a
word
while
the
rest
of
us
had
to
get
down
on
our
knees
and
beg
harbison
went
out
muttering
something
about
a
storm
coming
up
and
seeing
that
the
tent
was
secure
betty
mercer
went
with
him
she
had
been
at
his
heels
all
evening
and
called
him
tom
on
every
possible
occasion
indeed
she
made
no
secret
of
it
she
said
that
she
was
mad
about
him
and
that
she
would
love
to
live
in
south
america
and
have
an
indian
squaw
for
a
lady
s
maid
and
sit
out
on
the
veranda
in
the
evenings
and
watch
the
southern
cross
shooting
across
the
sky
and
eat
tropical
food
from
the
quaint
indian
pottery
she
was
not
even
daunted
when
dal
told
her
the
southern
cross
did
not
shoot
and
that
the
food
was
probably
canned
corn
on
tin
dishes
so
betty
went
with
him
she
wore
a
pale
yellow
dinner
gown
with
just
a
sophisticated
touch
of
black
here
and
there
and
cut
modestly
square
in
the
neck
her
shoulders
are
scrawny
and
after
they
were
gone
not
her
shoulders
harbison
and
she
aunt
selina
announced
that
the
next
day
was
monday
that
she
had
only
a
week
s
supply
of
clothing
with
her
and
that
no
policeman
who
ever
swung
a
mace
should
wash
her
undergarments
for
her
she
paused
a
moment
but
nobody
offered
to
do
it
anne
was
reading
de
maupassant
under
cover
of
a
table
and
the
rest
pretended
not
to
hear
after
a
pause
aunt
selina
got
up
heavily
and
went
upstairs
coming
down
soon
after
with
a
bundle
covered
with
a
green
shawl
and
with
a
white
balbriggan
stocking
trailing
from
an
opening
in
it
she
paused
at
the
library
door
surveyed
the
inmates
caught
my
unlucky
eye
and
beckoned
to
me
with
a
relentless
forefinger
we
can
put
them
to
soak
tonight
she
confided
to
me
and
tomorrow
they
will
be
quite
simple
to
do
there
is
no
lace
to
speak
of
dal
raised
his
eyebrows
and
very
little
aunt
selina
and
i
went
to
the
laundry
it
never
occurred
to
any
one
that
bella
should
have
gone
she
had
stepped
into
all
my
privileges
such
as
they
were
and
assumed
none
of
my
obligations
aunt
selina
and
i
went
to
the
laundry
it
is
strange
what
big
things
develop
from
little
ones
in
this
case
it
was
a
bar
of
soap
and
if
flannigan
had
used
as
much
soap
as
he
should
have
instead
of
washing
up
the
kitchen
floor
with
cold
dish
water
it
would
have
developed
sooner
the
two
most
unexpected
events
of
the
whole
quarantine
occurred
that
night
at
the
same
time
one
on
the
roof
and
one
in
the
cellar
the
cellar
one
although
curious
was
not
so
serious
as
the
other
so
it
comes
first
aunt
selina
put
her
clothes
in
a
tub
in
the
laundry
and
proceeded
to
dress
them
like
a
vegetable
she
threw
in
a
handful
of
salt
some
kerosene
oil
and
a
little
ammonia
the
result
was
villainous
but
after
she
tasted
it
or
snuffed
it
she
said
it
needed
a
bar
of
soap
cut
up
to
give
it
strength
or
flavor
and
i
went
into
the
store
room
for
it
the
laundry
soap
was
in
a
box
i
took
in
a
silver
fork
for
i
hated
to
touch
the
stuff
and
jabbed
a
bar
successfully
in
the
then
i
carried
it
back
to
the
laundry
and
dropped
it
on
the
table
aunt
selina
looked
at
the
fork
with
disgust
then
we
both
looked
at
the
soap
one
side
of
it
was
covered
with
round
holes
that
curved
around
on
each
other
like
a
coiled
snake
i
ran
back
to
the
store
room
and
there
a
little
bit
sticky
and
smelling
terribly
of
rosin
lay
anne
s
pearl
necklace
i
was
so
excited
that
i
seized
aunt
selina
by
the
hands
and
danced
her
all
over
the
place
then
i
left
her
trying
to
find
her
hair
pins
on
the
floor
and
ran
up
to
tell
the
others
i
met
betty
in
the
hall
and
waved
the
pearls
at
her
but
she
did
not
notice
them
is
harbison
down
there
she
asked
breathlessly
i
left
him
on
the
roof
and
went
down
to
my
room
for
my
scarf
and
when
i
went
back
he
had
disappeared
he
he
doesn
t
seem
to
be
in
the
she
tried
to
laugh
but
her
voice
was
shaky
he
couldn
t
have
got
down
without
passing
me
anyhow
she
supplemented
i
suppose
i
m
silly
but
so
many
queer
things
have
happened
i
wouldn
t
worry
betty
i
soothed
her
he
is
big
enough
to
take
care
of
himself
and
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
you
can
t
have
him
all
the
time
you
she
was
too
much
startled
to
be
indignant
she
followed
me
into
the
library
where
the
sight
of
the
pearls
produced
a
tremendous
excitement
and
then
every
one
had
to
go
down
to
the
store
room
and
see
where
the
necklace
had
been
hidden
and
max
examined
all
the
bars
of
soap
for
thumb
prints
harbison
did
not
appear
max
commented
on
the
fact
caustically
but
dal
hushed
him
up
and
so
anne
hugging
her
pearls
and
aunt
selina
having
put
a
final
seasoning
of
washing
powder
on
the
clothes
in
the
tub
we
all
went
upstairs
to
bed
it
had
been
a
long
day
and
the
morning
would
at
least
bring
bridge
i
was
almost
ready
for
bed
when
jim
tapped
at
my
door
i
had
been
very
cool
to
him
since
the
night
in
the
library
when
i
was
publicly
staked
and
martyred
and
he
was
almost
cringing
when
i
opened
the
door
what
is
it
now
i
asked
cruelly
has
bella
tired
of
it
already
or
has
somebody
else
a
rash
don
t
be
a
shrew
kit
he
said
i
don
t
want
you
to
do
anything
i
only
when
did
you
see
harbison
last
if
you
mean
last
i
retorted
i
m
afraid
i
haven
t
seen
the
last
of
him
then
i
saw
that
he
was
really
worried
betty
was
leading
him
to
the
roof
i
added
why
is
he
missing
he
isn
t
anywhere
in
the
house
dal
and
i
have
been
over
every
inch
of
max
had
come
up
in
a
dressing
gown
and
was
watching
me
insolently
i
think
we
have
seen
the
last
of
him
he
said
i
m
sorry
kit
to
nip
the
little
romance
in
the
bud
the
fellow
was
crazy
about
you
there
s
no
doubt
of
it
but
i
ve
been
watching
him
from
the
beginning
and
i
think
i
m
upheld
whether
he
went
down
the
water
spout
or
across
a
board
to
the
next
house
i
i
dislike
him
intensely
i
said
angrily
but
you
would
not
dare
to
say
that
to
his
face
he
could
strangle
you
with
one
max
laughed
disagreeably
well
i
only
hope
he
is
gone
he
threw
at
me
over
his
shoulder
i
wouldn
t
want
to
be
responsible
to
your
father
if
he
had
i
was
speechless
with
wrath
they
went
away
then
and
i
could
hear
them
going
over
the
house
at
one
o
clock
jim
went
up
to
bed
the
last
and
harbison
had
not
been
found
i
did
not
see
how
they
could
go
to
bed
at
all
if
he
had
escaped
then
max
was
right
and
the
whole
thing
was
and
if
he
had
not
then
he
might
be
lying
i
got
up
and
dressed
the
early
part
of
the
night
had
been
cloudy
but
when
i
got
to
the
roof
it
was
clear
starlight
the
wind
blew
through
the
electric
wires
strung
across
and
set
them
singing
the
occasional
bleat
of
a
belated
automobile
on
the
drive
below
came
up
to
me
raucously
the
tent
gleamed
a
starlit
ghost
of
itself
and
the
boxwoods
bent
in
the
breeze
i
went
over
to
the
parapet
and
leaned
my
elbows
on
it
i
had
done
the
same
thing
so
often
before
i
had
carried
all
my
times
of
stress
so
infallibly
to
that
particular
place
that
instinctively
my
feet
turned
there
and
there
in
the
starlight
i
went
over
the
whole
and
i
loathed
my
part
in
it
he
had
been
perfectly
right
to
be
angry
with
me
and
with
all
of
us
and
i
had
been
a
hypocrite
and
a
pharisee
and
had
thanked
god
that
i
was
not
as
other
people
when
the
fact
was
that
i
was
worse
than
the
worst
and
although
it
wasn
t
dignified
to
think
of
him
going
down
the
drain
pipe
still
no
one
could
blame
him
for
wanting
to
get
away
from
us
and
he
was
quite
muscular
enough
to
do
it
i
was
in
the
depths
of
when
i
heard
a
sound
behind
me
it
was
a
long
breath
quite
audible
that
ended
in
a
groan
i
gripped
the
parapet
and
listened
while
my
heart
pounded
and
in
a
minute
it
came
again
i
was
terribly
frightened
then
i
don
t
know
how
i
did
it
but
i
was
across
the
roof
kneeling
beside
the
tent
where
it
stood
against
the
chimney
and
there
lying
prone
among
the
flower
pots
and
almost
entirely
hidden
lay
the
man
we
had
been
looking
for
his
head
was
toward
me
and
i
reached
out
shakingly
and
touched
his
face
it
was
cold
and
my
hand
when
i
drew
it
back
was
covered
with
blood
chapter
xxii
it
was
delirium
i
was
sure
he
was
dead
he
did
not
move
and
when
i
caught
his
hands
and
called
him
frantically
he
did
not
hear
me
and
so
with
the
horror
over
me
i
half
fell
down
the
stairs
and
roused
jim
in
the
studio
they
all
came
with
lights
and
blankets
and
they
carried
him
into
the
tent
and
put
him
on
the
couch
and
tried
to
put
whisky
in
his
mouth
but
he
could
not
swallow
and
the
silence
became
more
and
more
ominous
until
finally
anne
got
hysterical
and
cried
he
is
dead
dead
and
collapsed
on
the
roof
but
he
was
not
just
as
the
lights
in
the
tent
began
to
have
red
rings
around
them
and
jim
s
voice
came
from
away
across
the
river
somebody
said
there
he
swallowed
that
and
soon
after
he
opened
his
eyes
he
muttered
something
that
sounded
like
andean
pinnacle
and
lapsed
into
unconsciousness
again
but
he
was
not
dead
he
was
not
dead
when
the
doctor
came
they
made
a
stretcher
out
of
one
of
jim
s
canvases
it
had
a
picture
on
it
and
jim
was
angry
enough
the
next
day
and
took
him
down
to
the
studio
we
made
it
as
much
like
a
as
we
could
and
we
tried
to
make
him
comfortable
but
he
lay
without
opening
his
eyes
and
at
dawn
the
doctor
brought
a
consultant
and
a
trained
nurse
the
nurse
was
an
offensively
capable
person
she
put
us
all
out
and
scolded
anne
for
lighting
japanese
incense
in
the
room
although
anne
explained
that
it
is
very
reviving
and
she
said
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
have
a
dozen
people
breathing
up
all
the
oxygen
and
asphyxiating
the
patient
she
was
too
i
disliked
her
at
once
any
one
could
see
by
the
way
she
took
his
pulse
just
letting
his
poor
hand
hang
without
any
support
that
she
was
a
purely
mechanical
creature
without
heart
well
as
i
said
before
she
put
us
all
out
and
shut
the
door
and
asked
us
not
to
whisper
outside
then
too
she
refused
to
allow
any
flowers
in
the
room
although
betty
had
got
a
florist
out
of
bed
to
order
some
the
consultant
came
stayed
an
hour
and
left
aunt
selina
who
proved
herself
a
trump
in
that
trying
time
waylaid
him
in
the
hall
and
he
said
it
might
be
a
fractured
skull
although
it
was
possibly
only
concussion
the
men
spent
most
of
the
morning
together
in
the
den
with
the
door
shut
now
and
then
one
of
them
would
tiptoe
upstairs
ask
the
nurse
how
her
patient
was
doing
and
creak
down
again
just
before
noon
they
all
went
to
the
roof
and
examined
again
the
place
where
he
had
been
found
i
know
for
i
was
in
the
upper
hall
outside
the
studio
i
stayed
there
almost
all
day
and
after
a
while
the
nurse
let
me
bring
her
things
as
she
needed
them
i
don
t
know
why
mother
didn
t
let
me
study
nursing
i
always
wanted
to
do
it
and
i
felt
helpless
and
childish
now
when
there
were
things
to
be
done
max
came
down
from
the
roof
alone
and
i
cornered
him
in
the
upper
hall
i
m
going
crazy
max
i
said
nobody
will
tell
me
anything
and
i
can
t
stand
it
how
was
he
hurt
who
hurt
him
max
looked
at
me
quite
a
long
time
i
m
darned
if
i
understand
you
kit
he
said
gravely
you
said
you
disliked
so
i
do
i
did
i
supplemented
but
whether
i
like
him
or
not
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
has
been
injured
perhaps
murdered
i
choked
a
little
which
which
of
you
did
it
max
took
my
hand
and
held
it
looking
down
at
me
i
wish
you
could
have
cared
for
me
like
that
he
said
gently
dear
little
girl
we
don
t
know
who
hurt
him
i
didn
t
if
that
s
what
you
mean
perhaps
a
flower
pot
i
began
to
cry
then
and
he
drew
me
to
him
and
let
me
cry
on
his
arm
he
stood
very
quietly
patting
my
head
in
a
brotherly
way
and
behaving
very
well
save
that
once
he
said
don
t
cry
too
long
kit
i
can
stand
only
a
certain
and
just
then
the
nurse
opened
the
door
to
the
studio
and
with
max
s
arm
still
around
me
i
raised
my
head
and
looked
in
harbison
was
conscious
his
eyes
were
open
and
he
was
staring
at
us
both
as
we
stood
framed
by
the
doorway
he
lay
back
at
once
and
closed
his
eyes
and
the
nurse
shut
the
door
there
was
no
use
even
if
i
had
been
allowed
in
in
trying
to
explain
to
him
to
attempt
such
a
thing
would
have
been
to
presume
that
he
was
interested
in
an
explanation
i
thought
bitterly
to
myself
as
i
brought
the
nurse
cracked
ice
and
struggled
to
make
beef
tea
in
the
kitchen
that
lives
had
been
wrecked
on
less
dal
was
allowed
ten
minutes
in
the
sick
room
during
the
afternoon
and
he
came
out
looking
puzzled
and
excited
he
refused
to
tell
us
what
he
had
learned
however
and
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
he
and
jim
spent
in
the
cellar
the
day
dragged
on
downstairs
people
ate
and
read
and
wrote
letters
and
outside
newspaper
men
talked
together
and
gazed
over
at
the
house
and
photographed
the
doctors
coming
in
and
the
doctors
going
out
as
for
me
in
the
intervals
of
bringing
things
i
sat
in
bella
s
chair
in
the
upper
hall
and
listened
to
the
crackle
of
the
nurse
s
starched
skirts
at
midnight
that
night
the
doctors
made
a
thorough
examination
when
they
came
out
they
were
smiling
he
is
doing
very
well
the
younger
one
said
he
was
hairy
and
dark
but
he
was
beautiful
to
me
he
is
entirely
conscious
now
and
in
about
an
hour
you
can
send
the
nurse
off
for
a
little
sleep
don
t
let
him
and
so
at
last
i
went
through
the
familiar
door
into
an
unfamiliar
room
with
basins
and
towels
and
bottles
around
and
a
screen
made
of
jim
s
largest
canvases
and
someone
on
the
improvised
bed
turned
and
looked
at
me
he
did
not
speak
and
i
sat
down
beside
him
after
a
while
he
put
his
hand
over
mine
as
it
lay
on
the
bed
you
are
much
better
to
me
than
i
deserve
he
said
softly
and
because
his
eyes
were
disconcerting
i
put
an
ice
cloth
over
them
much
better
than
you
deserve
i
said
and
patted
the
ice
cloth
to
place
gently
he
fumbled
around
until
he
found
my
hand
again
and
we
were
quiet
for
a
long
time
i
think
he
dozed
for
he
roused
suddenly
and
pulled
the
cloth
from
his
eyes
the
the
day
is
all
confused
he
said
turning
to
look
at
me
but
one
thing
seems
to
stand
out
from
everything
else
perhaps
it
was
delirium
but
i
seemed
to
see
that
door
over
there
open
and
you
outside
with
with
max
his
arms
were
around
it
was
delirium
i
said
softly
it
was
my
final
lie
in
that
house
of
mendacity
he
drew
a
satisfied
breath
and
lifting
my
hand
held
it
to
his
lips
and
kissed
it
i
can
hardly
believe
it
is
you
he
said
i
have
to
hold
firmly
to
your
hand
or
you
will
disappear
can
t
you
move
your
chair
closer
you
are
miles
so
i
did
it
for
he
was
not
to
be
excited
after
a
little
it
s
awfully
good
of
you
to
do
this
i
have
been
desperately
sorry
kit
about
the
other
night
it
was
a
ruffianly
thing
to
do
to
kiss
you
when
i
thought
you
are
to
keep
very
still
i
reminded
him
he
kissed
my
hand
again
but
he
persisted
i
was
mad
i
tried
to
give
him
some
medicine
but
he
pushed
the
spoon
aside
you
will
have
to
listen
he
said
i
am
in
the
depths
of
i
i
can
t
think
of
anything
else
you
see
you
seemed
so
convinced
that
i
was
the
blackguard
that
somehow
nothing
seemed
to
i
have
forgotten
it
all
i
declared
generously
and
i
would
be
quite
willing
to
be
friends
only
you
remember
you
said
friends
his
voice
was
suddenly
reckless
and
he
raised
on
his
elbow
friends
who
wants
to
be
friends
kit
i
was
almost
delirious
that
night
the
instant
i
held
you
in
my
arms
it
was
all
over
i
loved
you
the
first
time
i
saw
you
i
i
suppose
i
m
a
fool
to
talk
like
and
of
course
just
then
dallas
had
to
open
the
door
and
step
into
the
room
he
was
covered
with
dirt
and
he
had
a
hatchet
in
his
hand
a
rope
he
demanded
without
paying
any
attention
to
us
and
diving
into
corners
of
the
room
good
heavens
isn
t
there
a
rope
in
this
confounded
house
he
turned
and
rushed
out
without
any
explanation
and
left
us
staring
at
the
door
bother
the
rope
i
found
myself
forced
to
look
into
two
earnest
eyes
kit
were
you
very
angry
when
i
kissed
you
that
night
on
the
roof
very
i
maintained
stoutly
then
prepare
yourself
for
another
attack
of
rage
he
said
and
betty
opened
the
door
she
had
on
a
fetching
pale
blue
dressing
gown
and
one
braid
of
her
yellow
hair
was
pulled
carelessly
over
her
shoulder
when
she
saw
me
on
my
knees
beside
the
bed
oh
yes
i
forgot
to
say
that
quite
unconsciously
i
had
slid
into
that
position
she
stopped
short
just
inside
the
door
and
put
her
hand
to
her
throat
she
stood
for
quite
a
perceptible
time
looking
at
us
and
i
tried
to
rise
but
tom
shamelessly
put
his
arm
around
my
shoulders
and
held
me
beside
him
then
betty
took
a
step
back
and
steadied
herself
by
the
door
frame
she
had
really
cared
i
knew
then
but
i
was
too
excited
to
be
sorry
for
her
i
i
beg
your
pardon
for
coming
in
she
said
nervously
but
they
want
you
downstairs
kit
at
least
i
thought
you
would
want
to
go
but
perhaps
just
then
from
the
lower
part
of
the
house
came
a
pandemonium
of
noises
women
screaming
men
shouting
and
the
sound
of
hatchet
strokes
and
splintering
wood
i
seized
betty
by
the
arm
and
together
we
rushed
down
the
stairs
chapter
xxiii
coming
the
second
floor
was
empty
a
table
lay
overturned
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
a
broken
flower
vase
was
weltering
in
its
own
ooze
part
way
down
betty
stepped
on
something
sharp
that
proved
to
be
the
japanese
paper
knife
from
the
den
i
left
her
on
the
stairs
examining
her
foot
and
hurried
to
the
lower
floor
here
everything
was
in
the
utmost
confusion
aunt
selina
had
fainted
and
was
sitting
in
a
hall
chair
with
her
head
rolled
over
sidewise
and
the
poker
from
the
library
fireplace
across
her
knees
no
one
was
paying
any
attention
to
her
and
jim
was
holding
the
front
door
open
while
three
of
the
guards
hesitated
in
the
vestibule
the
noises
continued
from
the
back
of
the
house
and
as
i
stood
on
the
lowest
stair
bella
came
out
from
the
dining
room
with
her
face
streaked
with
soot
and
carrying
a
kettle
of
hot
water
jim
she
called
wildly
while
max
and
dal
are
below
you
can
pour
this
down
from
the
top
it
s
jim
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
carry
out
your
own
murderous
designs
he
said
and
then
as
she
started
back
with
it
bella
for
heaven
s
sake
he
called
have
you
gone
stark
mad
put
that
kettle
she
did
it
sulkily
and
jim
turned
to
the
policeman
yes
i
know
it
was
a
false
alarm
before
he
explained
patiently
but
this
is
genuine
it
is
just
as
i
tell
you
yes
flannigan
is
in
the
house
somewhere
but
he
s
hiding
i
guess
we
could
manage
the
thing
very
well
ourselves
but
we
have
no
cartridges
for
our
then
as
the
noise
from
the
rear
redoubled
if
you
don
t
come
in
and
help
i
will
telephone
for
the
fire
department
he
concluded
emphatically
i
ran
to
aunt
selina
and
tried
to
straighten
her
head
in
a
moment
she
opened
her
eyes
sat
up
and
stared
around
her
she
saw
the
kettle
at
once
what
are
you
doing
with
boiling
water
on
the
floor
she
said
to
me
with
her
returning
voice
don
t
you
know
you
will
spoil
the
floor
the
ruling
passion
was
strong
with
aunt
selina
as
usual
i
could
not
find
out
the
trouble
from
any
one
people
appeared
and
disappeared
carrying
strange
articles
anne
with
a
rope
dal
with
his
hatchet
bella
and
the
kettle
but
i
could
get
a
coherent
explanation
from
no
one
when
the
guards
finally
decided
that
jim
was
in
earnest
and
that
the
rest
of
us
were
not
crawling
out
a
rear
window
while
he
held
them
at
the
door
they
came
in
three
of
them
and
two
reporters
and
jim
led
them
to
the
butler
s
pantry
here
we
found
anne
very
white
and
shaky
with
the
pantry
table
and
two
chairs
piled
against
the
door
of
the
kitchen
slide
and
clutching
the
bag
that
held
her
jewels
she
had
a
bottle
of
burgundy
open
beside
her
and
was
pouring
herself
a
glass
with
shaking
hands
when
we
appeared
she
was
furious
at
jim
i
very
nearly
fainted
she
said
hysterically
i
might
have
been
murdered
and
no
one
would
have
cared
i
wish
they
would
stop
that
chopping
i
m
so
nervous
i
could
jim
took
the
burgundy
from
her
with
one
hand
and
pointed
the
police
to
the
barricaded
door
with
the
other
that
is
the
door
to
the
shaft
he
said
the
lower
one
is
fastened
on
the
inside
in
some
manner
the
noises
commenced
about
eleven
o
clock
while
brown
was
on
guard
there
were
scraping
sounds
first
and
later
the
sound
of
a
falling
body
he
roused
reed
and
myself
but
when
we
examined
the
shaft
everything
was
quiet
and
dark
we
tried
lowering
a
candle
on
a
string
but
it
was
extinguished
from
the
reporters
were
busily
removing
the
table
and
chairs
from
the
door
if
you
have
a
rope
handy
one
of
them
said
i
will
go
down
the
dal
says
that
all
reporters
should
have
been
policemen
and
that
all
policemen
are
natural
newsgatherers
the
cage
appears
to
be
stuck
between
the
floors
jim
said
they
are
cutting
through
the
door
in
the
kitchen
they
opened
the
door
then
and
cautiously
peered
down
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
i
touched
jim
gingerly
on
the
arm
is
it
is
it
flannigan
i
asked
shut
in
there
no
yes
i
don
t
know
he
returned
absently
run
along
and
don
t
bother
kit
he
may
take
to
shooting
any
anne
and
i
went
out
then
and
shut
the
door
and
went
into
the
dining
room
and
sat
on
our
feet
for
of
course
the
bullets
might
come
up
through
the
floor
aunt
selina
joined
us
there
and
bella
and
the
mercer
girls
and
we
sat
around
and
talked
in
whispers
and
leila
mercer
told
of
the
time
her
grandfather
had
had
a
struggle
with
an
escaped
lunatic
in
the
midst
of
the
excitement
tom
appeared
in
a
bathrobe
looking
very
pale
with
a
bandage
around
his
head
and
the
nurse
at
his
heels
threatening
to
leave
and
carrying
a
bottle
of
medicine
and
a
spoon
he
went
immediately
to
the
pantry
and
soon
we
could
hear
him
giving
orders
and
the
rest
hurrying
around
to
obey
them
the
hammering
ceased
and
the
silence
was
even
worse
it
was
more
suggestive
in
about
fifteen
minutes
there
was
a
thud
as
if
the
cage
had
fallen
and
the
sound
of
feet
rushing
down
the
cellar
stairs
then
there
were
groans
and
loud
oaths
and
everybody
talking
at
once
below
and
the
sound
of
a
struggle
in
the
dining
room
we
all
sat
bent
forward
with
straining
ears
and
quickened
breath
until
we
distinctly
heard
someone
laugh
then
we
knew
that
whatever
it
was
it
was
over
and
nobody
was
killed
the
sounds
came
closer
were
coming
up
the
stairs
and
into
the
pantry
then
the
door
swung
open
and
tom
and
a
policeman
appeared
in
the
doorway
with
the
others
crowding
behind
between
them
they
supported
a
grimy
unshaven
object
covered
with
whitewash
from
the
wall
of
the
shaft
an
object
that
had
its
hands
fastened
together
with
handcuffs
and
that
leered
at
us
with
a
pair
of
the
most
villainously
crossed
eyes
i
have
ever
seen
none
of
us
had
ever
seen
him
before
mr
lawrence
mcguirk
better
known
as
tubby
tom
said
cheerfully
a
celebrity
in
his
particular
line
which
is
man
and
rascal
a
victim
of
the
quarantine
like
we
ve
missed
him
for
a
week
one
of
the
guards
said
with
a
grin
we
ve
been
real
anxious
about
you
tubby
ain
t
a
week
goes
by
when
you
re
in
health
that
we
don
t
hear
something
of
mcguirk
muttered
something
under
his
breath
and
the
men
chuckled
it
seems
tom
said
interpreting
that
he
doesn
t
like
us
much
he
doesn
t
like
the
food
and
he
doesn
t
like
the
beds
he
says
just
when
he
got
a
good
place
fixed
up
in
the
coal
cellar
flannigan
found
it
and
is
asleep
there
now
this
aunt
selina
rose
suddenly
and
cleared
her
throat
am
i
to
understand
she
asked
severely
that
from
now
on
we
will
have
to
add
two
newspaper
reporters
three
policemen
and
a
burglar
to
the
occupants
of
this
quarantined
house
because
if
that
is
the
case
i
absolutely
refuse
to
feed
but
one
of
the
reporters
stepped
forward
and
bowed
ceremoniously
madam
he
said
i
thank
you
for
your
kind
invitation
but
it
will
be
impossible
for
us
to
accept
i
had
intended
to
break
the
good
news
earlier
but
this
little
game
of
prevented
me
the
fact
is
your
jap
has
been
discovered
to
have
nothing
more
serious
than
and
if
you
will
forgive
a
poultry
yard
joke
there
is
no
longer
any
necessity
for
your
being
cooped
then
he
retired
quite
pleased
with
himself
one
would
have
thought
we
had
exhausted
our
capacity
for
emotion
but
jim
said
a
joyful
emotion
was
so
new
that
we
hardly
knew
how
to
receive
it
every
one
shook
hands
with
every
one
else
and
even
the
nurse
shared
in
the
excitement
and
gave
jim
the
medicine
she
had
prepared
for
tom
then
we
all
sat
down
and
had
some
champagne
and
while
they
were
waiting
for
the
police
wagon
they
gave
some
to
poor
mcguirk
he
was
still
quite
shaken
from
his
experience
when
the
stuck
the
wine
cheered
him
a
little
and
he
told
his
story
in
a
voice
that
was
creaky
from
disuse
while
tom
held
my
hand
under
the
table
he
had
had
a
dreadful
week
he
said
he
spent
his
days
in
a
closet
in
one
of
the
maids
rooms
the
one
where
we
had
put
jim
it
was
jim
waking
out
of
a
nap
and
declaring
that
the
closet
door
had
moved
by
itself
and
that
something
had
crawled
under
his
bed
and
out
of
the
door
that
had
roused
the
suspicions
of
the
men
in
the
house
and
he
slept
at
night
on
the
coal
in
the
cellar
he
was
actually
tearful
when
he
rubbed
his
hand
over
his
scrubby
chin
and
said
he
hadn
t
had
a
shave
for
a
week
he
took
somebody
s
razor
he
said
but
he
couldn
t
get
hold
of
a
portable
mirror
and
every
time
he
lathered
up
and
stood
in
front
of
the
glass
in
the
dining
room
sideboard
some
one
came
and
he
had
had
to
run
and
hide
he
told
too
of
his
attempts
to
escape
of
the
board
on
the
roof
of
the
rope
and
the
hole
in
the
cellar
and
he
spoke
feelingly
of
the
pearl
collar
and
the
struggle
he
had
made
to
hide
it
he
said
that
for
three
days
it
was
concealed
in
the
pocket
of
jim
s
old
smoking
coat
in
the
studio
we
were
all
rather
sorry
for
him
but
if
we
had
made
him
uncomfortable
think
of
what
he
had
done
to
us
and
for
him
to
tell
as
he
did
later
in
court
that
if
that
was
high
society
he
would
rather
be
a
burglar
and
that
we
starved
him
and
that
the
women
had
to
dress
each
other
because
they
had
no
lady
s
maids
and
that
the
whole
lot
of
us
were
in
love
with
one
man
it
was
downright
malicious
the
wagon
came
for
him
just
as
he
finished
his
story
and
we
all
went
to
the
door
in
the
vestibule
aunt
selina
suddenly
remembered
something
and
she
stepped
forward
and
caught
the
poor
fellow
by
the
arm
young
man
she
said
grimly
i
ll
thank
you
to
return
what
you
took
from
me
last
tuesday
mcguirk
stared
then
shuddered
and
turned
suddenly
pale
good
lord
he
ejaculated
on
the
stairs
to
the
roof
you
they
led
him
away
then
quite
broken
with
aunt
selina
staring
after
him
she
never
did
understand
i
could
have
explained
but
it
was
too
awful
on
the
steps
mcguirk
turned
and
took
a
farewell
glance
at
us
then
he
waved
his
hand
to
the
policemen
and
reporters
who
had
gathered
around
goodby
fellows
he
called
feebly
i
ain
t
sorry
i
ain
t
jail
ll
be
a
paradise
after
and
then
we
went
to
pack
our
trunks
note
from
max
which
came
the
next
day
with
its
enclosure
my
dear
kit
the
enclosed
trunk
tag
was
used
on
my
trunk
evidently
by
mistake
higgins
discovered
it
when
he
was
unpacking
and
returned
it
to
me
under
the
misapprehension
that
i
had
written
it
i
wish
i
had
i
suppose
there
must
be
something
attractive
about
a
fellow
who
has
the
courage
to
write
a
love
letter
on
the
back
of
a
trunk
tag
and
who
doesn
t
give
a
tinker
s
damn
who
finds
it
but
for
my
peace
of
mind
ask
him
not
to
leave
another
one
around
where
i
will
come
across
it
max
written
on
the
back
of
the
trunk
tag
don
t
you
know
that
i
won
t
see
you
until
tomorrow
for
heaven
s
sake
get
away
from
this
crowd
and
come
into
the
den
if
you
don
t
i
will
kiss
you
before
everybody
are
you
coming
written
below
no
indeed
this
was
scratched
out
and
beneath
coming
